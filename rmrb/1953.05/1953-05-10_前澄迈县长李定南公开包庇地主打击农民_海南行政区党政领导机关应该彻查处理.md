Editor's Note: Landlord class element Li Dingnan infiltrated revolutionary organizations, usurped important leading positions, and openly carried out anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities. The circumstances are extremely serious. According to an editorial in the "New Hainan Daily" on this incident, the Party organization and leading cadres of Chengmai County, and even certain Party cadres at the Hainan Administrative Region level, were not completely unaware of Li Dingnan's actions. However, the land reform has passed, the review has passed, and the vast number of cadres have undergone several rounds of training, but Li Dingnan's crimes have been shielded until recently when they were exposed. Why is this the case? We hope that the Party and government leading organs of Chengmai County and the Hainan District, while investigating and handling Li Dingnan's crimes, will also investigate the reasons why such bad people and bad deeds have not been exposed for a long time. Only in this way can we promote a thorough resolution of this aspect of the problem and avoid the recurrence of similar events.

According to the "New Hainan Daily": Li Dingnan (currently Chief of the Finance Section of the Hainan Reclamation Bureau), the former head of Chengmai County in the Hainan Administrative Region, used his authority during his tenure as county head to openly protect the interests of the landlord class and suppress and oppress the victimized peasants.

Li Dingnan, born into a landlord family, did not change his class position despite the Party's long-term education. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, he was given a disciplinary warning of probation within the Party and removed from his administrative position due to a vague class stance, inability to distinguish between enemies and friends, and a weak sense of organization. After the liberation of Hainan, Li Dingnan served as the head of Chengmai County, still standing on the position of the landlord class. He often associated with landlords, local bullies, and counter-revolutionaries, and valued these people very much. He shielded Wu Rujian, a traitor and counter-revolutionary whom the people demanded be severely punished, went bird hunting with Wang Yongyuan, a secret service chief (who has been executed), and convened meetings of feudal leaders to discuss the issue of "maintaining local security." With his support and authorization, landlords and local bullies such as Chen Xuechuan and Wang Zhonghan became cadres and continued to rule the people. Wang Zhihu (executed), the county's biggest local bully and landlord, was even more appreciated by Li Dingnan. This man was an extremely heinous counter-revolutionary, having served as a county councilor and director of the salt affairs bureau for the Kuomintang, organized reactionary armed forces to destroy the revolution, and seized a lot of land from the peasants. But Li Dingnan believed that Wang Zhihu had great "prestige" and always regarded him as a confidant. With Li Dingnan's support, he became a member of the Presidium of the first People's Representative Conference of Chengmai County, and was "elected" to attend the first People's Representative Conference of Hainan. Because Wang Zhihu had Li Dingnan's strong support, he began to sell a large amount of land and cattle after returning from the meeting in Hainan, causing landlords in various villages to follow suit in selling their property and undermining land reform. Li Dingnan even wanted to further promote Wang Zhihu to be the deputy county head. What is particularly abhorrent is that Li Dingnan actually used his authority to post notices publicly protecting Wang Zhihu's feudal property and insulting and attacking the victimized peasants. The course of events was as follows: Before liberation, Wang Zhihu had forced the peasants to plant a bamboo forest three miles long and one mile wide for him, forbidding anyone to approach it, or to graze cattle and sheep; if any peasant violated this, they would not only have to offer wine and apologize, but also be severely beaten. Almost all the peasants in the village had been beaten and punished by Wang Zhihu because of this. In 1951, Wang Zhihu's son, Wang Yanluan, "accused" the Chengmai County People's Government, saying that the peasants had "stolen" his father's "hard-earned" bamboo forest. Li Dingnan then ordered the staff to quickly write many notices and post them everywhere. The notices slandered the peasants who cut down the bamboo forest they had planted as "unfilial people taking the opportunity to steal bamboo and wood" and "intentionally sabotaging production," and therefore should be "severely punished." As soon as the notice came out, Wang Zhihu became even more ferocious, threatening the peasants everywhere, saying:
	“Look! This is the notice written by County Head Li!” The peasants said: “The Kuomintang treated us like cattle and horses, saying we were unfilial people; now County Head Li also issues a notice, scolding us as unfilial people. There is no difference between liberation and no liberation!”

Li Dingnan had tried his best to protect the interests of his own landlord family, shielding his uncle, Li Chuanzheng, who had forced peasants to death by collecting debts. In 1950, the tenants of Li Dingnan's eldest sister (a big landlord) could not pay the rent, and he used the official seal of the People's Government without authorization to write letters to the tenants, ordering them to deliver the rent. His uncle, Li Chuanzheng, was a big local bully and landlord with 1,200 mu of land, who had made his fortune by lending money at high interest rates and had long and cruelly exploited and oppressed the peasants. The local peasants hated him to the bone. However, Li Dingnan not only did not punish Li Chuanzheng according to the law, but also used his authority after liberation to urge him to collect rent and debts. For example, peasants in Qundian and Meiyu villages in the Fourth District of the county owed Li Chuanzheng a lot of rent, and the peasants resisted paying rent after liberation. Li Dingnan personally wrote a note for his uncle, stamped with his private seal, and asked Li Chuanzheng to take it to the peasants to collect rent. Once, at a county-level cadre meeting, Li Dingnan publicly proposed that his uncle Li Chuanzheng should go and collect old debts. With such a nephew as his backer, Li Chuanzheng continued to do evil after liberation, and even forced Lin Shaolin's son, Lin Shijie, to death in the process of forcing rent and collecting debts. Lin Shaolin was a poor peasant from Mingshan Village, Meiting Township, Fourth District of the county. More than ten years ago, he borrowed 80 yuan in silver dollars from Li Chuanzheng, which, with interest, totaled 100 yuan. Shaolin was unable to repay, and used seven *gong* of paddy fields (more than two *mu*) to offset the price of 150 yuan in silver dollars. But before it was completed, another landlord, Wang Bangchao, seized the field and cultivated it (Shaolin owed him 40 yuan). Later, Shaolin and his nephew Lin Xuanran jointly borrowed 80 yuan in silver dollars from Li Chuanzheng. After his nephew died, Li Chuanzheng demanded that he alone pay the money. He was so desperate that in August 1949, he reluctantly mortgaged two water buffaloes. At that time, Li Chuanzheng took one, and the other was still raised by the Lin family. After the liberation of Hainan, Li Chuanzheng not only took back the seven *gong* of paddy fields that had been occupied by Wang Bangchao, but also took away his only remaining buffalo on July 14, 1950. Shijie, Shaolin's son, saw that all the land and cattle had been robbed, especially after liberation, and was still subjected to such oppression, and committed suicide in despair. After Shijie's death, Li Chuanzheng stormed into Shaolin's house, slapped Shaolin twice, and cursed him: "Do you owe me money? Is it a crime for me to take your cattle? You use death to scare me, I'm not afraid even if your family dies a hundred times."

This incident happened after liberation and after the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, and the illegal landlord should obviously be severely punished according to law. However, Li Dingnan believed that "taking the cattle was reasonable," so he adopted a delaying attitude in handling this case. Lin Shaolin went to the County People's Government to find him three times, but was either stopped by his guards or told that he was busy and could not see him. He finally met him the fourth time, but Li Dingnan only promised to give him six *gong* of land and 800,000 yuan from Li Chuanzheng. As for the matter of forcing people to death, his reply was: "What can be done when people are dead?" Lin Shaolin could not bear it any longer and complained to the Hainan Military and Political Committee at the end of 1950. The Hainan Military and Political Committee ordered the County People's Court to stand firm and handle the matter seriously. However, Li Dingnan, who was the county head and president of the People's Court, still only exempted the past debts and gave another 800,000 yuan and seven *gong* of land as compensation for the deceased when he ruled on the case in January 1951. Regarding the main point of forcing people to death, he "took into consideration that Li Chuanzheng was over eighty years old and physically weak" and "had never been a local bully," and was exempted from criminal punishment. Afterwards, when he reported the handling of the matter to the Hainan Military and Political Committee, he not only intentionally distorted the facts to exonerate his uncle, but also deceived his superiors, saying that his handling was "through the opinions of the people" and that "Shaolin was willing." In fact, at that time, the deceased's mother wailed and firmly disagreed. Moreover, the 800,000 yuan was taken out by Li Dingnan himself and let the trial officer Wu Yiming deceive Lin Shaolin to accept it in the name of repaying the cattle money. Shortly after the hasty conclusion of this case, Meiting Township was preparing to carry out land reform. At this time, Li Dingnan was afraid that Li Chuanzheng would be struggled against by the peasants, so he hurriedly sent Li Chuanzheng to the Hainan People's Court in the name of the County People's Court "for custody on behalf" on the grounds that Li Chuanzheng's presence at home would "hinder the progress of land reform" and hinder the county head's "leading credibility," so that the peasants could not find him.

Li Dingnan was usually very cold to revolutionary comrades and suppressed and attacked critics. In the County People's Government under his leadership, except for seven old cadres, all were old personnel and people with unclear histories and impure politics. He Xiuchun, Meng Dajing, Wang Hanqiao, Wang Renyi and other important accomplices of the big local bully and landlord Wang Zhihu all held important positions such as section chiefs in the County People's Government. He Xiuchun had served as a fake battalion commander and fake county captain during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, and became the chief of the agriculture and forestry section after being introduced by Wang Zhihu. When the cadres below raised objections, Li Dingnan not only did not accept them, but scolded them: "You are cadres who have just come down from the mountains, and you don't know how to work. If you don't let them (referring to He Xiuchun, etc.) do it, you can't do it." When handling the demobilization issue after liberation, Li Dingnan arbitrarily dismissed some female cadres who had been tested in arduous guerrilla warfare, and let them live with Kuomintang prisoners. Two female cadres could not bear this humiliation and tried to drown themselves. Comrade Li Ruxin questioned this, and Li Dingnan slammed the table and scolded: "You things are useless, I just don't want you. I don't allow you to call the people I retain Kuomintang counter-revolutionaries!" Comrade Li Dexuan of the county government fell ill and had no money for treatment. Someone reported this to Li Dingnan, but Li Dingnan ignored it. Li Dexuan did not receive treatment, and even had no place to eat, and died soon after.

In short, Li Dingnan, a landlord class element disguised in a revolutionary cloak, took good care of landlords, local bullies, and counter-revolutionaries, while turning a blind eye to the revolutionary people and cadres. The CCP Chengmai County Committee and the higher-level Party and government leading organs have always been indifferent to Li Dingnan's anti-Party and anti-people crimes. When dealing with the major case of Li Chuanzheng forcing Lin Shijie to death, the Standing Committee of the CCP Chengmai County Committee never discussed it, but allowed Li Dingnan to do whatever he wanted. In this way, Li Dingnan's crimes became legal. It was not until the "New Hainan Daily" revealed the truth of the entire incident last month that the Chengmai County Committee and the County People's Government organized an investigation team to go to the homes of the victimized peasants to conduct investigations.

    前澄迈县长李定南公开包庇地主打击农民
    海南行政区党政领导机关应该彻查处理
    编者按：地主阶级分子李定南混进革命组织，窃据重要的领导职位，公开进行反党反人民的罪恶活动，情节极其严重。据“新海南报”关于这一事件的社论说，澄迈县党的组织及其领导干部，以至海南行政区一级的某些党员干部，对于李定南的所作所为并非一无所闻。但是，土地改革过去了，复查也过去了，广大干部也经过了几次整训，而李定南的罪行却一直被包庇着，直到最近才被揭发出来。这究竟是为什么呢？我们希望澄迈县和海南区的党政领导机关在检查处理李定南的罪行时，同时查清这样的坏人坏事长期未能揭发的原因。只有这样，才能促进这一方面问题的彻底解决，避免类似事件的发生。
    据“新海南报”报道：海南行政区澄迈县前任县长李定南（现任海南垦植局财务科长）在任职县长的期间，利用职权公开保护地主阶级的利益，打击和压迫受害的农民。
    李定南出身地主阶级，在党的长期教育之下，他的阶级立场并未转变。早在抗日战争时期，即因阶级立场模糊、敌我不分和组织观念薄弱，受到过留党察看和行政上撤职的处分。海南解放以后，李定南出任澄迈县长，仍然站在地主阶级的立场。他经常和地主、恶霸和反革命分子来往，对这些人非常器重。他包庇过人民要求严惩的汉奸、反革命分子吴儒鉴，和特务头子王永源（已枪毙）一块到野外打过鸟，召集封建头子开会讨论过“维持地方治安”的问题。在他的支持和授意之下，地主恶霸陈学川、王中汉等都当了干部，继续统治人民。该县最大的恶霸地主王芝瑚（已枪决）更为李定南所赏识。此人是罪大恶极的反革命分子，曾任国民党的县参议员、盐务局长等伪职，曾组织反动武装摧残革命，霸占了农民很多土地。但李定南却认为王芝瑚很有“威信”，一向把他当成心腹。在李定南的支持之下，他当了澄迈县第一届人民代表会议主席团的委员，又“选”他去出席海南第一届人民代表会议。王芝瑚因有李定南极力撑腰，从海南开会回去便大量变卖土地、耕牛，致使各乡地主也纷纷跟着变卖财产，破坏土地改革。李定南还想进一步提拔王芝瑚当副县长。特别可恶的是李定南竟利用职权张贴布告，公开保护王芝瑚的封建财产，侮辱和打击受害农民。事情的经过是这样：解放以前，王芝瑚曾强迫农民替他种下一块三里长一里宽的竹林，不准人走近，也不准人牧放牛羊；如有农民违反，不仅要请酒赔礼，还要挨毒打。全村的农民几乎都因此挨过王芝瑚的毒打和处罚。一九五一年王芝瑚的儿子王延銮向澄迈县人民政府“控告”，说是农民“偷斩”他父亲“辛勤经营”的竹林。李定南便叫工作人员赶快写了很多布告，四处张贴。布告中污蔑农民砍伐自己栽培的竹林是“不肖之徒乘机盗伐竹木”，是“有意破坏生产”，因此要“严惩不贷”。布告一出，王芝瑚更加凶恶，到处恐吓农民说：
    “你们看吧！这是李县长写的布告！”农民说：“国民党把我们当牛当马，说我们是不肖之徒；现在李县长也出布告，骂我们是不肖之徒，解放与不解放没有两样！”
    李定南曾竭力保护自己地主家庭的利益，包庇因讨债而逼死农民的伯父李传正。一九五○年李定南的大姐（大地主）的佃户交不起租，他曾擅用人民政府的公章写信给佃户，命令他们送租。他的伯父李传正，是一个靠放高利贷起家的拥有一千二百亩田的大恶霸地主，曾经长期残酷地剥削和压榨农民，当地农民恨之入骨。但李定南不仅不依法制裁李传正，反而在解放后利用职权替他催租讨债。例如该县四区南兴乡群典、美玉等村农民欠李传正的租钱很多，解放后农民抗不交租。李定南就曾亲自替他伯父写了条子，盖上自己的私章，叫李传正带着向农民催租。有一次在县级干部会上，李定南更公然提出要他的伯父李传正去催讨旧债。李传正有了这样一个侄子作靠山，所以在解放后仍然继续为非作恶，甚至在逼租要债中逼死了农民林绍临之子林世杰。林绍临是该县四区美亭乡名山村的
    一个贫农，十多年前借了李传正现洋八十元，加利息共合一百元。绍临无法偿还，以七个工水田（合两亩多）折价现洋一百五十元抵偿。但尚未办妥，又为另一地主王邦朝把田占去耕种（绍临欠他四十元）。其后绍临又和侄儿林轩然向李传正合借八十元现洋。他侄儿死后，这笔钱李传正都要问他一人讨。他被逼得无法，在一九四九年八月忍痛以两头水牛做抵押。当时李传正牵走一头，另一头仍由林家饲养。海南解放以后，李传正不仅夺去他被王邦朝占去的七个工水田，而且在一九五○年七月十四日把他仅有的一头牛也牵走了。绍临之子世杰眼见土地和耕牛全被抢去，尤其是在解放之后还受这种压迫，便在绝望情绪下自缢而死。世杰死后，李传正还气势汹汹地跑到绍临家打了绍临两个耳光，大骂他：“你欠我钱，我拉你牛是有罪吗？你们以死来吓我，你家就是死了一百条命我也不怕。”
    这件事情发生在解放之后，而且是在土地改革法已经公布之后，显然应该依法严惩不法地主。但李定南却认为“牵牛是合理的”，因此在处理这一案件时采取了拖延的态度。林绍临三次到县人民政府找他，不是被他的警卫员拦住，就是推说有事不见。好容易在第四次见到了，但李定南只答应让李传正拨六个工田和八十万元给他。对于逼死人命一事的答复则是：“人死了，有什么办法？”林绍临忍无可忍，于一九五○年底向海南军政委员会控告。海南军政委员会曾命令该县人民法院必须站稳立场，严肃处理。但县长兼人民法院院长的李定南在一九五一年一月判决此案时，仍然只以免去过去债务，另给八十万元和七个工田，当作死者的抚恤费。对于逼死人命这一主要之点，则是“姑念李传正年已八十余，身体微弱”、“素来没有恶霸行为”，而免于刑事处分。事后他在向海南军政委员会报告处理经过时，不仅有意歪曲事实，替他的伯父开脱罪责，而且还欺骗上级，说是他的处理是
    “透过民众意见”，是“绍临甘愿”。实际上，当时死者的母亲痛哭流涕，坚不同意。而且那八十万元是李定南自己拿出来让审判员吴以明以偿还牛款为名，欺骗林绍临接受的。在这一案件草率结案不久，美亭乡即准备进行土地改革。此时李定南恐怕李传正会被农民斗争，便以李传正在家会“妨碍土地改革进行”，妨碍县长的“领导信誉”为藉口，匆忙地以县人民法院的名义把李传正送到海南人民法院“代为管制”，使农民找不到他。
    李定南平日对革命同志非常冷酷，而且压制和打击批评者。在他领导下的县人民政府，除了七个老干部以外，都是旧人员和历史不明和政治上不纯的分子。经由大恶霸地主王芝瑚介绍的何秀春、蒙大经、王汉蛟、王仁抑等国民党的重要帮凶，在县人民政府中都担任科长等重要职位。何秀春在国民党反动统治时期历任伪营长和伪县大队长，经过王芝瑚介绍，就当了农林科长。下面干部提出反对的意见，李定南不但不接受，反而大骂：“你们是刚下山的干部，又不晓得办公，叫他们（指何秀春等）不干，你们又办不了。”李定南在解放后处理复员问题时，把一些经过艰苦游击战争考验的女干部随意开革了，而且让她们和国民党的俘虏住在一起。有两个女干部不堪这种污辱，曾经要跳水自杀。李如新同志为此提出质问，李定南拍桌大骂：“你们这些东西没有用，就是不要。我留用的人，不准叫什么国民党反革命分子！”县府的李德轩同志生了病，无钱医治。有人向李定南反映，李定南置之不理。李德轩得不到治疗，甚至连吃饭的地方都没有，不久就死了。
    总之，李定南这个披着革命外衣的地主阶级分子，对于地主恶霸和反革命分子是爱护备至，而对于革命的人民和干部则见死不救。中共澄迈县委和上级党政领导机关对于李定南反党反人民的罪行，一直不闻不问。在处理李传正逼死林世杰这样重大的案件时，中共澄迈县委常委会从未讨论过，而是任李定南为所欲为。这样，李定南的罪行就变成了合法的。一直到上月“新海南报”揭露了全部事件真相之后，澄迈县委和县人民政府才组织调查组前往受害农民家中进行调查。
