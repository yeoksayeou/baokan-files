    Model Cadre Tong Yulan
    Xu Qinglin Zhang Guang Zhu Wenxi
    Editor's Note: Since April 8th, the Liaoxi Daily has focused on praising the outstanding work style of Tong Yulan, the Party branch secretary and deputy village head of Litun Village, Beizhen County. The Liaoxi Provincial People's Government awarded a banner to Litun Village, a model village for achieving bumper harvests, and also conferred the title of model cadre on Comrade Tong Yulan for her contribution to leading Litun Village's production. In addition to publishing an editorial praising Tong Yulan, the Liaoxi Daily also opened a special column, "Learn from Tong Yulan's Correct Work Style and Methods," introducing Tong Yulan's exemplary deeds and the effects of district and township cadres learning from Tong Yulan. The following are some model stories of Comrade Tong Yulan circulating among the local masses, which are worthy of study by cadres in various regions.

    Eliminating Apple and Pear Rust
    One day in the summer of 1950, Tong Yulan was returning from a meeting in the district when she saw villager Ye Chunwang sitting under a tree, weeping. Tong Yulan quickly went forward to ask the reason. Old Ye said in disappointment, "I've lived for over eighty years, and I've never seen fruit trees grow white beards (referring to 'apple and pear rust'. This disease causes long, slender, greyish-white catkins to grow under the leaves). At this rate, the pear trees will all wither and die. What will my family live on then!" Tong Yulan had already traveled dozens of miles, was very tired, and hungry, but seeing the masses facing such a big problem, she forgot about resting and not eating lunch and inquired everywhere for ways to eliminate this disease. No one in the whole village had ever seen this disease or knew how to treat it, so she reported the problem to the district people's government, which immediately reported it to the county agricultural science section. The county quickly sent people to help solve the problem. After research, it was determined that spraying pesticides was necessary to control it. But initially, many villagers were unwilling to spray. After Tong Yulan’s publicity and finding Feng Guoyu to try it and make a model, everyone sprayed the pesticide when they saw the real effect, which stopped the development of the disease. However, the disease was not completely eradicated. A few days later, Comrade Wen from the Northeast Agricultural Department came to Litun Village. Tong Yulan asked him to help research methods to prevent "apple and pear rust". As a result, it was discovered that the disease was transmitted by the spores from the thistles in Litun Village's graveyard. To eliminate this disease, the thistles had to be completely uprooted. These thistles belonged to many families in Miaoguangou Village. Some were afraid of "breaking the feng shui," and others didn't believe that the disease on the fruit trees was transmitted by the thistles, so they all disagreed. Afterward, Tong Yulan conducted persuasion and education, on the one hand, promoting to the masses to break with superstitious ideas; on the other hand, using facts to explain the harm of the thistles, such as the fruit trees on the south mountain of Litun, which were far from the thistles, did not get the disease, and the fruit trees on the north mountain of Litun, which were close to the thistles, did get the disease. Tong Yulan was patient and repeatedly explained to the masses, continuously publicizing from July to the Beginning of Winter. Those households with thistles also had fruit trees, which also got "apple and pear rust" that year. After Tong Yulan's painstaking publicity, their thinking cleared up, and they automatically uprooted the thistles. In this way, from that year on, "apple and pear rust" on the fruit trees in Litun Village was fundamentally eliminated. In 1950, Litun Village's fruit trees had a small harvest (resting year), yielding 200,000 catties. Last year was also a small harvest, yielding 600,000 catties. Now, whenever this matter is mentioned, people say, "Tong Yulan always does good things for us!"

    Borrowing Grain to Fight Drought
    In the summer of 1952, during the drought, many households in the village had nothing to eat. There were also some relatively wealthy households in the village that had surplus grain. Because they didn't understand the policy, were afraid of "revealing their wealth," and were afraid that they wouldn't get the grain back if they lent it out, some buried their grain, preferring to let it rot rather than lend it out, and some secretly hid their grain at relatives' homes. Tong Yulan knew in her heart who harvested how much grain and whether it was enough to eat. She believed that the grain shortage in the village could be resolved within the village. She convened a cadres' meeting to study the situation and decided to start by publicizing the lending policy. Afterward, the cadres went to different areas to publicize. Tong Yulan also went to a village to publicize and cultivate key personnel. After preliminary publicity and Tong Yulan's individual mobilization, Li Hongshan of Mintun voluntarily lent the grain he got from selling pigs to the Wu Guangtian family, which was in difficulty in the same group. Tong Yulan felt that using this fact to publicize the lending policy would be more effective, so she and the cadres went to various groups and natural villages to promote it in depth: on the one hand, explaining that the current lending was with borrowing and repayment, with a certain amount of interest, and on the other hand, calling on people to learn from Li Hongshan and promote class love. After such repeated and in-depth publicity, the masses understood the lending policy. Afterward, more than 50 households, including Ye Wanshan and Liu Fengjiu, lent out more than 40 dan of surplus grain, solving the problem of grain for households in difficulty and ensuring victory over the drought.

    Calculating the Wasteful Account of Feasting
    Litun Village had an old custom: when engaging a bride, marrying a wife, celebrating a baby's full moon, or changing a name, buying a house or land, they had to hold a feast. In the old society, those who were invited, besides those involved in the event, were the village head, the village chairman, and landlords, etc. This was partly due to "human relations"; on the other hand, things were difficult to do without holding a feast. After liberation, this old custom had not changed, and there were still 30 to 40 families in the village holding feasts every year, which was a great waste. Tong Yulan thought: A way must be found to eliminate this wasteful phenomenon. Otherwise, on the one hand, production is increased, and on the other hand, there is waste. In the spring of 1952, farmer Wu Haizhou bought a plot of land for building a house and, as usual, held a feast. When Wu Haizhou came to invite the village cadres to eat, some cadres advocated not going, and some cadres criticized Wu Haizhou, making Wu Haizhou feel embarrassed. Tong Yulan thought: Wu Haizhou's family is not well-off. Summer is a difficult time to get grain. Why is he spending so much money? After thinking about it, she understood that this was because the old custom had not changed, and a way must be found to change this old custom. So Tong Yulan said, "Everyone should still go!" There were more than 30 guests invited. After the meal, Tong Yulan spoke, saying, "Let's all calculate the bill! Wu Haizhou bought a total of 40 catties of white flour, at 2,000 yuan per catty, spending 80,000 yuan; 50 catties of pork, at 3,500 yuan per catty, spending 175,000 yuan... In total, he spent 363,000 yuan, accounting for a quarter of the price of his land. This money could buy one dan and eight dou of grain, which would be enough for Old Wu's family of five to eat for two months, or 280 catties of ammonium sulfate, which would be enough for ten mu of land, greatly increasing grain production." Tong Yulan then asked everyone: "Is it better to use this money in the right place? Or to eat a meal? There are 30 to 40 families in our whole village holding feasts every year, adding up to tens of millions of yuan. What a huge waste this is!" The more Wu Haizhou thought about it, the more he felt that he was wrong. Tong Yulan also announced this matter at the mass meeting, conducting a vivid and specific education on increasing production and practicing economy for the masses. Since then, no one has held feasts for these things again.

    Cutting Down Mountain Poplar Trees
    Litun Village is in a mountain valley. There are many mountain poplar trees on the mountain. This kind of tree doesn't grow very big, but it can be used for hoe handles, pickaxe handles, sickle handles, and earth basket bows, which is a large output for the whole village. This kind of tree is generally cut down once every five or six years. After cutting down, the tree roots continue to grow. If it is not cut down when the year comes, the tree will grow too large and rot. In 1950, it was the year to cut down trees, but the government issued an order to close the mountains for afforestation, stipulating that all public and private mountain forests were not allowed to be cut down. That year, Litun's fruit trees had a small harvest, producing not much fruit, and many people relied on cutting down trees to increase their income, but the government did not allow it, and the masses reported it to the village government one after another. Tong Yulan thought: The government's closing of the mountains for afforestation is to protect the mountain forests and provide the wood needed by the country and the people in a planned way, which is good for everyone and should be done. However, if this kind of mountain poplar tree in Litun Village is not cut down when the year comes, not only will the masses reduce their income, but the tree will also grow bad. Thinking of this, she felt that it was a problem, so she personally went to the Forestry Section of the Beizhen County People's Government for instructions. She introduced in detail the growth characteristics and logging time of the mountain poplar trees in Litun Village. After research, the county believed that it was harmful not to cut down this kind of mountain poplar tree when the year came, so they approved them to cut down. The masses and cadres praised Tong Yulan's style of implementing the instructions of the higher authorities according to the specific conditions of the local area.

    Resolving Marital Disputes
    During the Spring Festival of 1952, the Litun Village Mass Amateur Theater Troupe finished its performances in four natural villages in rotation. One day, a villager found a letter under a small stone in front of Tong Yulan's house. When he picked up the letter and looked at it, it was a letter "personally addressed to Village Head Tong". He handed the letter to Tong Yulan. The letter read: "Dear Village Head Tong: Please organize the theater troupe to perform the play promoting the Marriage Law in Hongshiya Village again, so that my parents can see it, open their minds, and stop interfering with my marriage autonomy, otherwise, my suffering..." After reading the letter, Tong Yulan felt that the Marriage Law had not been well implemented in the village, which was a shortcoming. This letter was the masses' demand and criticism of her. So she took the initiative to discuss it with the teachers of the various village schools, first promoting the Marriage Law in the village schools and then organizing discussions. Tong Yulan personally went to the village schools to promote and grasp the discussion of the Marriage Law. After this publicity, the students of the village schools improved their understanding of the Marriage Law. Subsequently, the theater troupe performed "The Little Son-in-Law" in Hongshiya Village. After performing the play and holding meetings to promote it, the thinking of many elderly people was also cleared up. On this day, Liu Fengqin and Fan Jiuyin got married autonomously. They specially invited Tong Yulan to attend the wedding. Liu Fengqin's mother told Tong Yulan with a smile, "Look, my daughter is autonomous, thanks to your help and education, this time I've figured it out, I won't be stubborn anymore!" Liu Fengqin's father, seeing the well-matched young couple, was also happy and couldn't close his mouth.

    In addition to regularly promoting the Marriage Law, she also paid attention to helping the masses resolve marital disputes at any time. For example, villager Liu Junji had interfered with his daughter's marriage autonomy. Tong Yulan personally persuaded and educated him many times and also found someone who got along well with Old Liu to persuade him, which finally made Old Liu realize the harm of the old marriage system and no longer interfere with his daughter's marriage autonomy. On the day his daughter got married, Old Liu and his wife said to Tong Yulan, "Our thinking is clear, it's still better to have marriage autonomy!" Once, Tong Yulan learned that villager Liu Chungge was going to marry his fifteen-year-old son, which was not in accordance with the Marriage Law. She found both families together to discuss it, explained the harm of early marriage to children and grandchildren, and the engaged men and women themselves first proposed that they did not agree with the marriage arranged by their parents. Both parents also thought it over and voluntarily dissolved the engagement. This matter was resolved correctly, and the Marriage Law was also specifically promoted. Under Tong Yulan's earnest implementation of the Marriage Law, social customs in Litun Village have changed, and free marriage has been recognized by the masses as the best. Therefore, sixteen pairs of young men and women in the village have married autonomously.

    Resolutely Overcoming Difficulties
    In the winter of 1951, the district arranged the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Tong Yulan had lived in this mountain valley for many years and was very familiar with the local situation. When the district committee secretary finished talking about what counter-revolutionaries were, she had a number in her heart. But in order to make it more detailed and more sure, she went to investigate and understand the situation in various places day and night, discovered many new materials, and found out the crimes of these people.

    One night, the district suddenly sent a notice, asking to report the materials they had learned in writing to the district committee at eight o'clock the next morning. This made Tong Yulan very difficult because she only knew a few words and could not write a report; but the materials were needed urgently, and she could not ask someone else to write them, so she finally came up with a way to overcome this great difficulty. When Tong Yulan was usually investigating the materials, she was afraid of forgetting them, so she learned some words. She used the words she learned to put together people's names and simple crimes. But there were still some things she couldn't write, and it was night, so it was not easy to go outside to ask. Finally, she drew a picture on the letter, an adult tying up a child, explaining the meaning of kidnapping. The next morning, she delivered the report materials to the district on time.

    This work was arranged by Guo Dehui, the propaganda committee member of the district committee. Tong Yulan's letter was received by Wang Guolin, the organization committee member. He did not know the situation. When he saw Tong Yulan's letter, he laughed and said, "Wow! Tong Yulan has reported everything about the villagers dancing the yangko!" When Comrade Guo Dehui heard this, he immediately took the letter and saw words such as "habitual bandit", knowing that it was an important report. He immediately went to Litun Village, and Tong Yulan made a report in person, explaining the process of writing the letter.

    On June 1 of that year, the day when the whole county arrested counter-revolutionaries together, four heinous counter-revolutionaries in Litun Village were completely arrested. These bad guys were punished. The people of Litun Village were very happy, thanking the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for getting rid of the harm for them, and also thanking Tong Yulan for working hard for them.

    A Good Example for Rural Cadres
    Tong Yulan is a good example for the cadres of Litun Village to learn from. Agricultural labor model Feng Guoyu said, "After I became a public security officer, I had to do a lot of work, but I didn't do it well. In addition, I was impatient and couldn't patiently persuade and educate the masses, so the masses didn't want to approach me. Tong Yulan saw that I had this shortcoming and talked to me. I said, 'I didn't embezzle, what's wrong with being a little tough!' Tong Yulan repeatedly said to me, 'To do things for everyone, you must explain the reasons and make the masses do it voluntarily. Only in this way can you truly complete the task.' She also told me, 'In your work, you must pay attention to praising the good ones and making examples for everyone.' Since then, I have learned this method of work. Tong Yulan is really a good example for us to learn from." Some cadres were unwilling to learn this method of work, saying, "If the masses have a high level of awareness, you can persuade and educate them. If the masses do not have a high level of awareness, you have to force them." Tong Yulan launched a struggle against this wrong idea, patiently and repeatedly explaining, "If the masses do not have a high level of awareness, you should educate them even more; if the masses do not have a high level of awareness, it means that our work has not been done well." Tong Yulan also introduced her leadership experience, she said:
    "The masses are the most practical. No matter what work you do, they are unwilling to do it if you don't explain it. Sometimes, just talking about the reasons is not enough, you have to set an example. The masses are 'better to hear than to see, better to see than to do,' and we should work like this." In this way, the cadres who insisted on the style of coercion and command gradually changed their style.

    Under the leadership of Tong Yulan, not only has production in Litun Village developed year by year and the lives of the masses have improved year by year, but also the thinking of the masses has progressed year by year. Many facts have proved this. In March of this year, when the Liaoxi Agricultural Department's work group and Liang Hongjiang and other farmers from Litun Village were surveying water sources near Litun Village, they saw a plume of smoke rising in the sky above the South Mountain. Liang Hongjiang and others estimated that there was a mountain fire, so they automatically sent two people to the South Mountain to investigate and one person to the village to mobilize the masses to put out the mountain fire. After about twenty or thirty minutes, Liang Hongjiang and others returned and said:
    "The fire is out!" They said, "Protecting forests and preventing fires, joint defense is everyone's responsibility--this was proposed by Comrade Tong Yulan. Since she advocated carrying out the forest protection and fire prevention campaign, there has not been a single mountain fire in Litun Village. In previous years, mountain fires were commonplace, but now they are not possible..."

    This ordinary woman, who grew up in a farm laborer's family, raised pigs for landlords from the age of ten, and lived a hard life for thirty years, has finally become an excellent Party worker under the education of the Party.

专栏：党的生活

    模范干部佟玉兰
    许清林  张光  朱文熹
    编者按：辽西日报从四月八日起比较集中突出地表扬了北镇县李屯村党支部书记兼副村长佟玉兰的优秀的工作作风，辽西省人民政府给丰产模范村李屯村颁发了奖旗，还给领导李屯村生产有功的佟玉兰同志以模范干部的称号。辽西日报除了发表社论表扬佟玉兰以外，还辟了一个专栏“学习佟玉兰的正确工作作风和工作方法”，介绍佟玉兰的模范事迹和区乡干部学习佟玉兰的效果。下面是一些在当地群众中流传着的佟玉兰同志的模范事例，值得各地干部学习。
    消灭果树赤星病
    一九五○年夏天，有一天佟玉兰从区上开会回来，走到李屯东头时，看见叶春望老乡正坐在树底下流泪。佟玉兰急忙上前询问原因。老叶头失望地说：“我活到八十多岁了，没见过果树长白胡子（就是‘赤星病’。这种病害是在树叶底下长细长灰白色的絮），眼看梨树都要干巴死了，往后一家人可指着啥过啊！”本来佟玉兰走了几十里路，已经很累了，加上没吃午饭，肚子又饿，可是她见到群众有了这么大的困难，她顾不得休息，也没吃午饭，就到处打听，找消灭这种病害的办法。全村没有人见过这种病，都不会治，她就把这个问题报告了区人民政府，区上立刻反映到县农业科，县里马上派了人来帮助解决。经过研究以后，认为必须打药水才能治住。但起初很多老乡不愿意打，经过佟玉兰宣传，又找了冯国玉试用做出样子，大伙见到真有实效才打起药水来，这才制止住这种病害的发展。可是病害还没有根除，过了几天，东北农业部温同志来到李屯村，佟玉兰请他帮助研究防止“赤星病”的办法。结果发现这种病是李屯村的坟营地里的刺松上的病菌传染的。要想消灭这种病害，必须把刺松完全刨掉。这些刺松是庙广沟屯好多家的，有的怕“破了风水”，还有的不相信果树长病是刺松传染的，所以都不同意。以后佟玉兰就进行说服教育，一方面向群众宣传要打破迷信思想；一方面用事实说明刺松的害处，如李屯南山的果树离刺松远就没得这个病，李屯北山的果树离刺松近就得了这个病。佟玉兰有耐心，反复地向群众解释，一直由七月宣传到立冬。有刺松那些户也有果树，这年也得了“赤星病”，经过佟玉兰苦口婆心地宣传，他们思想通了，自动把刺松刨掉了。就这样从这年起，李屯村果树“赤星病”从根本上消灭了。一九五○年李屯村果树是小年（歇枝年），结果二十万斤，去年也是小年，结果六十万斤，现在一提起这件事，人们都说：“佟玉兰净给我们办好事！”
    借粮抗旱
    一九五二年夏天，正是抗旱的时候，村子里很多户没有吃的，村子里还有一部分比较富裕户，存有余粮；由于他们不了解政策，怕“露富”，怕借出去不还，有的就把粮食埋起来，宁可埋坏也不敢往外借，有的偷着把粮食藏到亲戚家。佟玉兰对于谁家打粮多少、够吃不够吃，心里有个数。她认为缺吃粮在本村是能够解决的。她召开了一个干部会，研究了情况，决定从宣传借贷政策入手。以后干部们分头展开了宣传。佟玉兰也深入到一个屯去宣传并培养骨干。经过初步宣传和佟玉兰个别动员，民屯李洪山把卖猪得的粮食，自动借给了本组的困难户吴广田家。佟玉兰觉得用这个事实宣传借贷政策，会更有力量，她就和干部们到各组和各个自然屯去深入宣传：一面说明现在的借贷是有借有还，还给一定的利钱，一面号召向李洪山学习，发扬阶级友爱。经过这样反复深入的宣传，群众明白了借贷政策，以后有叶万山、刘凤久等五十多户，借出了四十多石余粮，解决了困难户的吃粮问题，保证战胜了旱灾。
    算算请客的浪费账
    李屯村有这么一个旧习惯：聘姑娘，娶媳妇，小孩满月或者更名贺号，买房治地都要请客。在旧社会里被请的人，除了事情来往人，就是村长，屯董和地主等人。这一方面是“人情”关系；另一方面，不请客事情就难办。解放以后，这个旧习惯还没有改变，全村每年还有三四十家请客，浪费很大。佟玉兰想：要设法消灭这种浪费现象，不然，一面增产，一面却在浪费。一九五二年春天，农民吴海洲买了一块房场，照例请客。当吴海洲来请村干部去吃饭时，有的干部主张不去吃，有的干部对吴海洲进行了批评，弄得吴海洲下不了台。佟玉兰想：吴海洲家不充裕呀，夏天正是吃粮困难时候，为什么还花这么多的钱呢？想来想去，明白了这是旧习惯没有改变之故，定要设法改变这种旧习惯。于是佟玉兰说：“大家还是去吧！”被请的客人共有三十多名，吃完饭以后，佟玉兰说话了，她说：“大家来算算账吧！吴海洲共买了白面四十斤，每斤两千元，花了八万元，猪肉五十斤，每斤三千五百元，花了十七万五千元……总共花了三十六万三千元，占他买房场的价钱四分之一。这些钱能买一石八斗粮食，就够老吴家五口人吃两个月，能买二百八十斤硫安，就够上十垧地，增产很多粮食。”佟玉兰又问大家：“这些钱是用到正地方好呢？还是吃一顿饭好呢？咱们全村每年有三四十家请客，加起来就有千万元，这是多大的浪费啊。”吴海洲越想越觉得自己不对。佟玉兰又在群众大会上公布了这件事情，对群众进行了一次生动具体的增产节约教育，从此再没有人为这些事情请客了。
    砍山杨树
    李屯村是一个山沟。山上有很多山杨树。这种树长得不大，可做锄杆、镐把、镰刀把和土篮子弓子，这是全村很大一笔出产。这种树一般的在五、六年砍伐一次，砍伐后树根子继续生长，如果到了年头不砍伐，树就会长大包了。一九五○年，正是伐树年头，可是政府下了封山育林的命令，规定凡是公私山林一律不准砍伐。这年李屯果树是小年，产果不多，很多人靠着伐树增加收入，但政府不准了，群众纷纷向村政府反映。佟玉兰想：政府封山育林是为了保护山林，有计划地供给国家和人民需要的木材，对大家都有好处，是应该的。可是，李屯村这种山杨树到了年头要不砍伐，不但群众减少了收入，树也长坏了。她想到这里，感到是个问题，就亲自到北镇县人民政府林业科请示。她详细介绍了李屯村山杨树的生长特点和砍木时期。县里经过了研究，认为这种山杨树到了年头不伐是有害的，就批准他们可以伐。群众和干部都称赞佟玉兰这种根据当地具体情况执行上级指示的作风。
    解决婚姻纠纷
    一九五二年春节期间，李屯村群众业余剧团在四个自然屯的轮回演出结束了。一天，有个老乡在佟玉兰家门口，发现一块小石头底下压着一封信，把信拣起来一看，是“佟村长亲收”的信，他就把信交给了佟玉兰。信上写着：“亲爱的佟村长：请你组织剧团到红石磖子屯来再演一次宣传婚姻法的剧吧，好叫我的父母看看，开开脑筋，别干涉我的婚姻自主了，要不，我的痛苦……。”佟玉兰看完信，觉得婚姻法在村里没贯彻好，是个缺点。这信是群众的要求，也是对她的批评。于是她就主动地和各屯民校教师研究，先在民校里宣传婚姻法，又组织讨论。佟玉兰亲自到民校宣传和掌握婚姻法的讨论。经过这一宣传，民校学员对婚姻法提高了认识，随后，组织剧团在红石磖子屯演出了“小女婿”。经过演剧和开会宣传，好多老年人的思想也搞通了。这一天，刘凤琴和范久印自主结婚了，他们特意把佟玉兰请来参加婚礼，刘凤琴的母亲笑呵呵的告诉佟玉兰说：“你看我姑娘自主了吧，多亏你对我们帮助和教育，这回我算想通了，再不顽固啦！”刘凤琴的父亲看见一对班配的小两口，也乐的闭不上嘴了。
    她除经常宣传婚姻法以外，并注意随时帮助群众解决婚姻纠纷。比如刘俊吉老乡曾干涉过女儿的婚姻自主，佟玉兰亲自说服教育多次，又找和老刘头合得来的人去说服，到底使老刘头认识了旧婚姻制度的害处，不再干涉女儿的婚姻自主了。他姑娘结婚的那天，老刘头和他老伴对佟玉兰说：“我们的思想算通了，还是婚姻自主好啊！”有一次，佟玉兰知道刘春阁老乡要让十五岁的儿子结婚，这是不合婚姻法的。她就把两家找到一块来研究，讲清了早婚对儿女、子孙后代的害处后，订婚的男女本人首先提出不同意父母包办的婚姻，双方的父母也想开了，自愿解除了婚约。这件事正确的解决了，也具体宣传了婚姻法。李屯村在佟玉兰认真贯彻婚姻法的情形下，转变了社会习气，自由结婚已被群众公认为是最好的了，因此，全村有十六对男女青年自主结了婚。
    坚决克服困难
    一九五一年冬，区上布置了镇压反革命的工作。佟玉兰生活在这个山沟里多年了，当地的情况摸的很准，区委书记讲完了什么是反革命分子时，她心里就有了个数。可是她为了作到更详细、更有把握，不分黑夜白天的去到各地调查了解，发现了很多新的材料，查明了这些人的罪恶。
    有一天晚上，区里忽然来通知，让把所了解的材料在第二天早八点向区委会做书面汇报。这下子可把佟玉兰难坏了，因为她只认得很少几个字，不能写报告；但是材料要的紧，自己写不好又不能求人写，终于她想出了办法克服了这个大困难。佟玉兰在平时调查材料时，怕忘记了，现学了一些字，她用学到的一些字，七拼八凑地把人名和简单的罪恶好歹算写上了，可是还有些事她没有办法写出来，又是在晚上，也不好到外边去问，最后她就在信上画了个图，大人绑小人，说明绑票的意思。第二天早晨，她按时把汇报材料送到区。
    这个工作是区委宣传委员郭德惠布置的，佟玉兰的信被组织委员王国林收到后，他不了解情况，看见佟玉兰的信便大笑着说：“吓！佟玉兰把他们村扭秧歌都汇报了！”郭德惠同志听见了，马上接过信来，看有“惯匪”等字样，知道是重要汇报，立刻就到了李屯村，佟玉兰又当面做了汇报，说明了写信经过。
    在这年六月一日，全县一同逮捕反革命分子那天，李屯村四名罪大恶极的反革命分子完全被抓住了。这些坏家伙们受到了惩处，李屯村的人民非常高兴，感谢共产党毛主席为他们除了害，也感谢佟玉兰为他们辛苦地工作。
    农村干部的好榜样
    佟玉兰是李屯村干部学习的好榜样。农业劳动模范冯国玉就说：“我当了公安员后，好多工作都要我做，可是做不好，再加上我性情急躁，不能耐心说服教育群众，群众就不愿接近我。佟玉兰看到我有这个缺点，就找我谈话。我说：‘我也没贪污，态度硬一点可有啥呢！’佟玉兰反复地对我说：‘给大家办事情，必须要说明道理，要群众自愿干。只有这样，才能真正完成任务。’又嘱咐我说：‘在工作中，要注意表扬好的，给大家做样子。’从这以后，我就学会了这个工作方法。佟玉兰真是我们学习的好模样。”也有些干部就不愿意学习这种工作方法，如说：“群众觉悟高，可以进行说服教育，群众觉悟不高，就得强迫。”佟玉兰就和这种错误思想展开了斗争，耐心地反复地说明了：“群众觉悟不高，更应当进行教育；群众觉悟不高，是咱们的工作没做好。”佟玉兰又介绍了自己的领导经验，她说：
    “群众是最实际的，无论什么工作，不说明就不愿干，有时候光说道理还不行，还得做出样子来。群众就是‘听到不如见到，见到还不如做到’，咱们就应当这样去工作。”这样，坚持强迫命令作风的干部，也就逐渐转变了作风。
    在佟玉兰领导之下，李屯村不仅生产一年比一年发展，群众生活一年比一年改善，而且群众的思想也一年比一年进步。许多事实都这样证明着。今年三月间，辽西农业厅工作组和李屯村的农民梁洪江等正在李屯村附近勘察水源时，见到南山上空升起了一阵烟雾，梁洪江等估计发生了山火，就自动派两个人上南山去侦察，一个人到村里动员群众去扑灭山火。约有二三十分钟光景，梁洪江等回来说：
    “火扑灭了！”他们说：“护林防火，联防有责——这是佟玉兰同志提出来的。从她提倡开展护林防火运动到现在，李屯村就没有发生过一次山火，要是往常年景，山火是家常便饭，现在就不能了……。”
    这个生长在一个雇农家里，十岁起就给地主放猪，过了三十年苦日子的普通妇女，在党的教育下，终于成了一个优秀的党的工作者。
