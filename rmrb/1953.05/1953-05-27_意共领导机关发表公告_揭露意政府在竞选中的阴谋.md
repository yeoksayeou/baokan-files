Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 25th (TASS): The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued an announcement saying:

    “Reports coming from various regions of Italy indicate that the government authorities are not only intensifying their efforts to undermine the election campaigns of opposition parties and intimidate voters, but are also attempting to create an atmosphere of agitation and resentment among the people by relying on arbitrary and malicious actions. We are referring to actions that attempt to interrupt or even disrupt meetings criticizing the government and the ruling party; the implementation of censorship on election slogans; the prohibition of campaign parades...

    “At the same time, existing signs lead one to believe that, in order to conduct large-scale fraud in the election, someone is preparing to illegally use the election certificates of voters who have already moved away or died, as well as other voters, or to move voters during the night of the first and second days of voting.

    “We must expose all these facts and signs in a timely manner and issue warnings so that public opinion can judge, because there is no doubt that someone is attempting to hold elections in an atmosphere of oppression and malice...

    “Therefore, all democratic parties urgently need to be vigilant, not to provide pretexts for provocations, and not to be harmed by provocations."

    意共领导机关发表公告
    揭露意政府在竞选中的阴谋
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社罗马二十五日讯：意大利共产党领导机关发表一项公告说：
    “从意大利各区送来的报告说，政府当局不但试图变本加厉地破坏反对党的竞选、恫吓选民，并且正在企图依靠专横和作恶的行动在人民中间制造一种激动与愤懑的空气。我们所指的是那些力图打断或甚至冲散批评政府和执政党的集会的行动；对选举标语实行检查制度；禁止竞选游行……。
    “同时，现有的征象使人相信，为了在选举中进行大规模的舞弊，有人正在准备非法利用已经外移或死亡的以及其他的选民的选举证，或在投票的第一和第二天的夜间迁移选民。
    “我们必须及时地把所有这些事实与征象全盘揭发出来，并提出警告，让舆论来加以公断，因为毫无疑问有人企图在高压与作恶的空气中举行选举……。
    “因此，各个民主党派亟需提高警惕，不给以挑衅的藉口并不为挑衅所害。”
