Many Units of the Former Tianjin Railway Bureau Seriously Violated Financial Discipline

Leading cadres of the former Tianjin Railway Bureau did not pay enough attention to financial management. The financial system of the bureau was lax and discipline was loose. In 1952, serious errors occurred continuously, such as illegally purchasing fixed assets with business funds, maintenance funds, and funds to be turned over to higher authorities; using special funds for other purposes; and unclear financial revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the railway bureau failed to complete the annual financial plan.

In 1952, more than 30 units under the former Tianjin Railway Bureau, including the Tianjin Branch Engineering Team, Guye Rolling Stock Depot, Cangxian Engineering Section, Nankou Locomotive Depot, Taiyuan Hospital, Shijiazhuang Materials Factory, Zhangjiakou Branch Engineering Team, and Beijing Battery Factory, successively used over 310 million yuan of business expenses, maintenance expenses, and payable funds to illegally purchase fixed assets or use them as engineering expenses belonging to basic construction projects. At the beginning of 1952, the Tianjin Branch Engineering Team's tool preparation plan was inadequate. During construction, it used 93.3666 million yuan of project funds to purchase track lifters, cranes, pulling hoists, tents, bicycles, typewriters, etc. The Beijing Battery Factory withheld 58.6872 million yuan of payable funds to buy a powder mixing machine and ten exhaust fans.

Due to the bureau's lax financial supervision, the error of using special funds for other purposes and disrupting the financial plan occurred repeatedly. The Zhangjiakou Railway Factory originally planned 19 house major repair projects, but later changed it to 17 projects, reducing two projects, but exceeded the entire budget by nearly 30 million yuan. The factory's original plan for major mechanical repairs was 18 units, using more than 140 million yuan; after the plan was approved, the factory only carried out major repairs on 14 units, and still exceeded the budget by more than 17 million yuan.

Some units only cared about completing production tasks and neglected financial income, and financial systems were generally chaotic. In the "full load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement" last year, the former Tianjin Railway Bureau's rolling stock and commercial departments focused on completing transportation tasks and neglected business regulations, failing to collect a large number of storage fees and shunting fees. Some cargo owners delayed taking delivery even after the goods arrived and the extraction procedures were completed. Some even used the freight yard as a cargo transfer point to save their own handling fees. According to preliminary statistics from the Tianjin West Station in the second half of 1952, the bureau failed to collect a total of more than 16.35 billion yuan in storage fees. Some newly built dedicated lines have been in use for a long time, but shunting fees have been missed. For example, the dedicated lines of Gaocheng Station on the Shide Line and Tongxian Station on the Tongxian Branch Line were already in use in the third quarter of last year, but the Beijing and Shijiazhuang branches did not notify the stations of the charging date and calculation mileage, resulting in missed shunting fees of more than 1.76 billion yuan. Because these uncollected funds have crossed over into the new year, some cargo owners have been unable to add to their budgets and cannot compensate, causing losses to the railway.

The financial work of some materials departments is also very chaotic. The Tianjin, Fengtai, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan and other materials factories generally experienced discrepancies between material accounts and actual inventory. However, they all fabricated "material accounts are consistent" reports to deceive their superiors. Many factories do not use formal procedures when receiving and issuing materials, borrowing at will, resulting in numerous errors. The Fengtai Materials Factory borrowed 60 tons of lime and 30,000 red bricks to the Beijing Branch Engineering Team on the basis of a note, but because the note was lost, the borrowing unit did not admit it, and it took a long time to settle the account. The Datong Materials Depot had discrepancies between material accounts and actual inventory. The actual inventory of materials within the stock limit was 800 million yuan more than the inventory, and the actual inventory of materials outside the limit was 1.6 billion yuan less than the inventory.

Due to the above reasons, the completion of the former Tianjin Railway Bureau's 1952 financial plan was seriously affected. According to the fixed asset department of the former Tianjin Railway Bureau, the approved capital was 22 billion yuan, but the capital occupied in the 1952 final account reached 716.7 billion yuan, of which materials alone accounted for 344.9 billion yuan. The original plan was for a capital turnover of 8.18 times (44 days), but only 6.74 times (53 days) was actually completed, resulting in a waste of 51.9 billion yuan. Operating income was 306.1 billion yuan short, and profits to be turned over were 30 billion yuan short.

The fact that many units under the former Tianjin Railway Bureau have seriously violated financial discipline should arouse serious attention from all localities, and it is hoped that the Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Beijing Railway Administrations, which now manage the above-mentioned units, will be responsible for handling the above problems separately.

### 前天津铁路局很多单位严重违反财政纪律

    前天津铁路局很多单位严重违反财政纪律
    前天津铁路局领导干部不重视财务管理，该局财务制度不严、纪律松弛，在一九五二年内连续发生以营业款、维修款、上缴款非法购置固定资产，专款不专用，财务收支不清等严重错误，因此，该铁路局未能完成全年的财务计划。
    一九五二年内前天津铁路局所属天津分局工程队、古冶车辆段、沧县工务段、南口机务段、太原医院、石家庄材料厂、张家口分局工程队、北京蓄电池厂等三十多个单位，先后动用营业费、维修费、应上缴款项等三亿一千余万元，非法购置固定资产，或作属于基本建设项目的工程费用。天津分局工程队在一九五二年初备置工具计划不周，在施工中用工程款九千三百三十六万六千元添买了起道机、起重机、拉练滑车、帐篷、自行车、打字机等。北京蓄电池厂扣住应上缴款项五千八百六十八万七千二百元，买了一台和粉机、十个抽风扇。
    该局由于财务监督不严，专款不专用，打乱财务计划的错误一再发生。张家口铁路工厂原计划房屋大修理的工程为十九件，后来改为十七件，减少了两件工程，反而超出全部预算近三千万元。该厂的机械大修理原计划是十八台，用款一亿四千余万元；计划批准后，该厂机械大修只作了十四台，还超出预算一千七百余万元。
    某些单位只顾完成生产任务，忽视财务收入，财务制度普遍存在混乱现象。在去年开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，前天津铁路局车、商部门偏重于完成运输任务，忽视业务规章，漏收大批囤存费、调车费。有的货主在货物到达办完提取手续后仍拖延不取。有的甚至利用货场作为货物收转处，以节省自己的搬运费。据天津西站一九五二年下半年的材料初步统计，该局共漏收囤存费一百六十三亿五千多万元。有的新建专用线使用后，长期漏收调车费。如石德线藁城站、通县支线通县站的专用线早在去年第三季即已使用，但北京、石家庄两分局并未通知车站收费日期及计算里程，以致漏收调车费达十七亿六千多万元。这些漏收的款项由于跨过年度，某些货主已无法追加预算，不能补偿，造成了铁路方面的损失。
    有些材料部门的财务工作也很混乱。天津、丰台、张家口、太原等材料厂普遍发生料帐不符现象。但他们都假造了“料帐相符”的报告来欺骗上级。许多厂在收发材料时不用正规手续，随意借用，因而错误百出。丰台材料厂凭借条借给北京分局工程队六十吨白灰，三万块红砖，因借条遗失，借料单位不承认，拖了很长时间才算清。大同材料库料帐不符，库存定量内材料实存比盘点多八亿元，定量外实存材料比盘存短少十六亿元。
    由于上述原因，严重地影响了前天津铁路局一九五二年度财务计划的完成。按前天津铁路局定额资产部核定资金为二二○亿元，但一九五二年决算占用资金即达七一六七亿元，其中只材料一项即积压资金三四四九亿元。资金周转原计划八·一八次
    （四十四天），实际只完成六·七四次（五十三天），因而浪费资金五一九亿元。运营收入欠收三○六一亿元，上缴利润欠三百亿元。
    前天津铁路局所属很多单位严重违反财政纪律的事实应引起各地严重注意，并希望现在管理上述这些单位的天津、太原、北京铁路管理局负责分别处理以上问题。    （来维良）
