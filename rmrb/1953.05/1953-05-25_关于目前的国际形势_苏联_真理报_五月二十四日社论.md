    On the Current International Situation
    -- Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, May 24th
    In recent months, countries around the world have shown great interest in the steps being taken to resolve international disputes. This is natural in the current situation.
    No one can deny that among a wide range of international figures, efforts to ease tensions in international relations are increasing. Any forward step in resolving disputes will reduce the risk of war, help end the arms race that is devastating countries, and ease the minds of millions. Conversely, maintaining international tensions means further intensifying the arms race, continuing to increase military spending, and continuously increasing the tax burden that mainly falls on the shoulders of the masses.
    In this situation, any new step taken by a government on the international stage becomes the object of close study not only by governments but also by the broadest public.
    It is generally known that the recent statements by Soviet government leaders, expressing the Soviet Union's willingness to resolve international disputes or outstanding international issues on the basis of mutual agreement among the parties concerned, have aroused great interest and sympathy. These statements strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in the possibility of resolving pressing international problems, because they know that the Soviet government's statements are never contrary to its true intentions.
    Everyone also knows that those who care about defending peace regarded some of the words spoken by President Eisenhower in his speech on April 16 as a gesture of peace. He said, "There is no one of these issues, great or small, that is not readily amenable to solution if only we have the will to respect the rights of all nations," and "America is ready to assume its full share" in resolving international disputes. However, other points included in the same speech have completely lost their positive significance. It must now be pointed out that in Eisenhower's recent statement on May 20, there is not a trace of that gesture of peace, let alone any action to strengthen it.
    British Prime Minister Churchill's recent speech in the House of Commons (in which he spoke about some pressing international issues) and the debate on this speech have attracted attention not only in Britain but also in places far away from Britain. This is quite natural.
    The British Prime Minister supported the U.S. government's position on many points. But his speech also reflected the divergence between the British and U.S. positions on some of the most important issues.
    A considerable part of Churchill's speech was about relations with the Soviet Union. Not every point he made in this regard can be accepted by Soviet public opinion without criticism and serious objection. But at present, the primary thing is not to point out where we disagree with the British Prime Minister. It is more important to emphasize those points that can promote the solution of controversial international issues in the interest of peace and the security of all countries.
    Churchill's speech contained some proposals that reflected the British people's efforts to strive for peace and proved that the British Prime Minister adopted a realistic attitude in assessing certain important factors in the current international situation. The broad public who are interested in maintaining peace expressed their approval of these proposals. At the same time, these proposals are being attacked by those who particularly want to maintain the current state of tension in the international situation, especially in the United States.
    It is worth noting the following remarks made by Churchill:
    "I do not believe that the so grave problem of reconciling the security of Russia with the freedom and safety of Western Europe is insoluble." These remarks cannot but win the sympathy of those who are truly striving to resolve pressing international problems and who detest war—war that will bring incalculable disasters to all countries, especially in the current situation.
    In our country, Churchill's above-mentioned remarks have attracted attention and are regarded as a timely step in the current international situation.
    The Prime Minister's declaration that it is possible to "reconcile" the "security" of the Soviet Union with that of Western European countries is, of course, based on his own country's interests. At the same time, there is no doubt that a policy aimed at combining the national interests of Britain with the interests of maintaining peace and strengthening international cooperation will be understood and supported by the people of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.
    Churchill's proposal to reconcile the security of the Soviet Union with the security of Western Europe is of particular importance because the British Prime Minister raised this issue, not only touching on the relations between Great Britain and the Soviet Union, but also on the issue of maintaining and strengthening peace.
    The characteristic of the current international situation is that the various problems that must be resolved are very complex, which makes it necessary for people to give due understanding to those who believe that any attempt to discuss and resolve all the controversial and outstanding issues at once is doomed to failure. Progress in resolving difficult issues such as the Korean War or the German problem can facilitate the easing of the current tension in the international situation and also lay the foundation for resolving other problems. When Churchill said the following, he may have had this attitude of resolving international problems in mind: "I think it is a mistake to think that we cannot settle anything with the Soviet Union unless everything is settled. The solution of two or three of our difficulties would be an important gain to every country that wishes for peace."
    The Korean problem is one of the most important international problems, and its peaceful resolution is of concern to the people of all countries.
    As everyone knows, the diplomatic initiatives put forward by the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and supported by the Soviet Union, have provided a real possibility for achieving a ceasefire and ending the Korean War.
    According to the agreement reached, the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war has been implemented. Negotiations on the repatriation of all prisoners of war resumed in Panmunjom on April 26. The proposals put forward by the Chinese and Korean sides, especially the recent proposal of May 7, as is obvious to everyone without prejudice, provide the necessary basis for practically resolving this last problem that hinders the achievement of a ceasefire and thus ends the Korean War.
    Churchill advocated a patient and sympathetic consideration of the proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides. He said: "At the present time, in my view, we have no reason to think that this could not become the basis for reaching an agreement."
    Churchill's statement, as well as the speeches by some members of the British House of Commons sharply criticizing the "United Nations Command" representatives who are obstructing the Panmunjom talks, reflected dissatisfaction with the delay in resolving the Korean problem, and reflected the growing dissatisfaction in all sectors of British society. The continued barbaric bombing of Pyongyang and other Korean cities and villages, and of Chinese cities such as Andong, as well as the attitude of U.S. General Harrison aimed at undermining the Panmunjom talks, have aroused righteous anger and protests in Britain and other countries.
    Prime Minister Nehru, in his speech to the Indian House of the People the other day, stated that Harrison's position also clearly violated the United Nations resolution on the Korean prisoner of war issue passed at the end of last year. Nehru directly said that the proposals of the Chinese and Korean sides should be used as the basis for negotiations, and he hoped that they could be used as the basis for resolving the problem. However, due to the attitude taken by Harrison, the Panmunjom talks have been delayed again.
    In this situation, it is entirely understandable that the prominent Labor Party leader Attlee expressed his clear dissatisfaction with the progress of the Panmunjom talks in the House of Commons.
    The German problem occupies a special place in Churchill's speech. He rightly called it the "main problem" of Europe. However, if this is the case, Churchill's consideration of the German problem should have special importance in his speech. However, judging from Churchill's consideration in this regard, it cannot be said that he expressed a genuine desire to resolve the above-mentioned "main" international problem. It is worth noting that Churchill did not even feel it necessary to mention the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement, which he personally participated in drafting, and which stipulated the major principles for truly resolving the German problem by restoring Germany's unification and making it a peace-loving and democratic country.
    The historical significance of the above-mentioned international documents lies in the fact that they demonstrated that the Western countries and the Soviet Union had achieved a coordinated policy and specific agreements on the German problem, which were reached during the war and immediately affirmed after the end of the war. In this sense, the above-mentioned agreement on promoting the unification of Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country is the most significant achievement in "reconciling the security of the Soviet Union with the freedom and safety of Western Europe."
    Even today, we cannot but pay close attention to the extent to which the steps taken by Britain in international relations since the British Prime Minister delivered his speech are in line with the main principles of these agreements signed by the major powers, and to what extent new agreements between them can promote international peace and security.
    However, the experience of recent years has proved that the Western countries' unilateral refusal to implement the agreements they have concluded has hindered the resolution of disputes and stalemates. There is no doubt that if the agreements between the major powers on major international issues were implemented, the entire current international situation would be completely different, and there would be no such acute and tense situation as it is now.
    Speaking of which, we must talk about why Churchill felt the need to mention the infamous 1925 Locarno Treaty. According to him, the basis of this treaty was a "simple provision" which stated that if Germany attacked France, Britain would help France, and if France attacked Germany, Britain would help Germany. Churchill did not explain that the Locarno system actually fueled the aggressive ambitions of German militarism at that time. This treaty restricted Germany's freedom of action in the West, but allowed it freedom of action in the East, directing German aggression towards the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that the Locarno policy was a significant factor in causing World War II.
    History shows that as long as the German militarist revanchists are given freedom of action, and as long as no effective measures are taken to ensure that Germany develops along a peaceful path, then German militarism will revive quite quickly, and no matter what formal guarantees and obligations are made, they cannot make Germany's neighbors believe that their security is guaranteed, and cannot make them believe that they will not be threatened by German aggression once again.
    It should be pointed out that, even from the perspective of Great Britain's own security interests, the Locarno Treaty seems weak, and as far as the security of other European countries, especially all countries neighboring Germany such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, is concerned, it goes without saying that the attempt to restore to the Locarno Treaty would cause large-scale diplomatic maneuvering, allowing some countries to form unstable combinations and groups to oppose other countries, and the result would inevitably be to aggravate rather than ease international tensions.
    In fact, how can the ideas of the Locarno Treaty be realized for today's Germany? When Churchill talked about the ideas of Locarno, he did not mention a word about the issue of rebuilding German unification, and this issue is of decisive significance not only for Germany itself, but also for ensuring the security of Europe and the world.
    When Churchill tacitly talks about the unilateral actions currently being taken regarding the conclusion of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, he wants the British government's policy to consolidate the division of Germany. Not only that, but it can be seen from his speech that he not only regards the division of Germany as an accomplished fact, but also regards it as a development that people can and should agree to.
    Churchill said: "The policy of Her Majesty's Government is to adhere in spirit and in letter most faithfully to our agreements with Western Germany." The Prime Minister emphasized: "We shall not fail in any of our obligations to Western Germany."
    According to these words, does it not mean that the explicit and implicit spirit of the agreements signed between major powers in order to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany is to be sacrificed to the explicit and implicit spirit of those unilaterally signed agreements? And the contents of these unilateral agreements are to approve the division of Germany, approve the remilitarization of West Germany, and turn this part of Germany into a hotbed of militarism and revanchist aggression.
    Let us put aside Churchill's completely incorrect assertion that Soviet policy has aggravated the German problem. Authoritative Soviet spokesmen have stated more than once the real reasons for the current situation in Germany, and there is no need to repeat these words here. Let us also put aside the rather harsh words that Churchill said in order to give a negative description of the situation in East Germany. Naturally, we can use some equally sharp but much more truthful words to describe the situation in West Germany, but the current interest is not in mutual bickering.
    Everyone will understand that the division of Germany means restoring a hotbed of war in the heart of Europe. The German people will not be willing to lose the unification they gained with great effort and sacrifice almost a century ago. Therefore, the main task regarding Germany is to end Germany's current state of division, and to prepare and conclude a peace treaty with Germany that can guarantee the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, in accordance with the basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement concluded between the major powers.
    Preventing the revival of German militarism should be the primary concern of countries that have been invaded by Germany more than once. In addition, the German people should be guaranteed all the conditions for developing their country's peaceful industry, and all the conditions for Germany to participate in the world's economic life according to its industrial and technological level, and to further develop its rich national culture.
    In this regard, the new treaty should avoid the mistakes of the Versailles system, the purpose of which was to enslave a great country. Everyone knows that the founders of the Versailles system were concerned with preventing Germany from economically becoming a competitor in the world market again, rather than truly preventing Germany's remilitarization.
    Because Churchill shied away from such vital issues as the unification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and because he emphasized that the British government will adhere to its recent unilateral obligations to West Germany, Churchill has disconcerted those who hoped to see a genuine desire to resolve the world's existing differences in his speech.
    It is worth noting that Churchill did not even mention the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty signed in London in 1942, which was aimed at preventing new German aggression. This treaty was concluded precisely to strengthen the security of Britain and the Soviet Union, and its spirit is fully in line with the main international documents on the German problem, including the Potsdam Agreement.
    Churchill mentioned the Austrian problem in his speech, saying that the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty would also help alleviate the current international tensions. On this point, it must be emphasized that the long delay in resolving the Austrian peace treaty issue should be the direct responsibility of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, which have not only shown serious wavering in the attitude previously agreed upon by the four major powers, but have also directly abandoned this attitude.
    Things have reached such a point that the three Western countries have refused the text of the Austrian peace treaty, which the four major powers had almost completely agreed upon after a long period of discussion. They opposed this agreed-upon treaty text and put forward their so-called "summary treaty," which was drafted without the participation of the Soviet Union, and which seriously infringed upon the rights of the Soviet Union and the democratic rights of the Austrian people.
    All of this shows who ultimately determines whether to eliminate the obstacles to the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty.
    During the debate in the British House of Commons, some members emphasized the fact that the British Prime Minister did not mention China in his report. They raised this point with good reason.
    The Chinese people have embarked on the broad road of social progress, which is an important change in the entire international situation. Naturally, it is impossible for the British Prime Minister not to pay attention to this. Although Churchill did not talk about the China issue this time, the Labor Party leader Attlee said in the House of Commons that it is impossible to ignore the legitimate rights and interests of the great People's Republic of China.
    Attlee said: "China should take its rightful place in the Security Council. China does appear to be developing into a very capable country. It is right that it should be one of the great powers."
    Of course, Attlee said this not out of any sympathy for communism (only McCarthy might suspect him of this), but because of Britain's actual economic interests, and everyone knows that economic interests are the basis of political interests. Attlee put forward the most reasonable explanation for why Britain is paying attention to resolving relations with China. He emphasized that Britain's hope of expanding trade with the United States has been greatly reduced, and that the United States' "aid" cannot compensate for the losses caused by the reduction in trade. Attlee insisted on the proposition of "trade, not aid," and from Britain's own interests (and not only Britain's interests), this proposition can only be considered reasonable. Attlee quite resentfully accused Britain's overseas allies, saying: "We are often strongly urged not to trade with China, not even trade in goods that have little to do with war power. Like others, the settlement of this China affair is of vital interest to us."
    Another prominent member of the Labor Party, the leader of the opposition within the Labor Party, Bevan, also recently made a statement, in which he even more emphasized the urgency of resolving relations with China.
    Churchill's anti-communist sentiment may not be less than that of other Western politicians, who believe that "Moscow is directing" all national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies. However, it can be clearly seen from his speech that he did not express this sentiment. For example, the following words prove this point: "I should say I do not think—I offer my opinion with all diffidence—that the sudden advance of the Vietminh troops to the borders of Siam [Thailand] should lead us to conclude that this is an action prompted from Moscow."
    If Western politicians consider the actual facts more when estimating the reasons for the increasing national and national liberation movements in Asia or any other part of the world, then the chances of mutual understanding between the "West" and the "East" will be greater, and the possibility of avoiding unnecessary disputes and bloodshed will be greater.
    It should be pointed out that unlike the leaders of other capitalist countries, Churchill is not just generally saying that current differences in international relations should be resolved peacefully. He also put forward constructive suggestions on methods for examining pressing international problems.
    Churchill said: "There should be a supreme effort to bridge the gulf between the great Powers, and that such a meeting should be confined to the smallest number of persons possible and should be held on the highest level." "Such a conference should be conducted in a friendly and informal manner and it should be on the highest level, but it should also be conducted with a measure of privacy."
    Obviously, Churchill, unlike some other politicians in the West, did not stipulate that one party must assume any obligations as a prerequisite for proposing a conference.
    Churchill's rich experience accumulated over many years of participating in handling international affairs obviously prevents him from having a basic misconception that one party can force another party, and especially a party like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, to accept preconditions for reaching an agreement on outstanding international issues during peacetime. Churchill cannot but take into account a fact well known in international relations practice: only during wartime can the victorious party force the defeated party to accept preconditions for negotiations, or else the two sides are so disparate in strength that the stronger party wants to take advantage of the weaker party and threatens to wage a war that the latter cannot afford to force it to accept arbitrary "peace" terms.
    We must point out the importance of Churchill's suggestion, which is clearly based on his experience of direct contact with important politicians in a recent period. The fact that this suggestion has aroused warm and positive comments in many countries around the world proves its importance.
    For example, Churchill's demand in his speech to at least solve a few basic problems in order to ease international tensions is very timely in today's situation.
    The U.S. State Department issued a statement on May 13 on the British Prime Minister's speech; and it is said that President Eisenhower agreed with the contents of this statement. Regarding the possibility of convening a meeting of a small number of politicians as suggested by Churchill, the State Department did not deny it. However, for some reason, it once again raised the notorious precondition claim against the Soviet Union alone. It seems that the Soviet Union still has to do something more to ensure the success of the Panmunjom talks and the resolution of the Austrian peace treaty issue. Although, everything in the past has shown very clearly that it is not the Soviet Union but the United States and Britain that have never fulfilled their "due share" in either of these issues.
    From newspaper comments and the U.S. State Department's statement, it is very clear that Churchill's proposal, which is supported by important leaders of British parties, has met with a "reserved" or even "lukewarm" response from some senior figures in the United States. Some of the differences in opinions between British and American politicians may be the result of increasingly prominent economic contradictions between the two countries, which are largely related to the harsh U.S. policies restricting trade with Western European countries.
    As for the Soviet Union, Soviet public opinion, in addition to holding opposing views on some of Churchill's specific proposals as mentioned above, is interested in some of the constructive factors included in Churchill's speech. The future will show to what extent these factors reflect the true intentions of the British government headed by Churchill.
    It must be admitted that there are already some signs that cannot but make the Soviet people and international figures who are defending the cause of peace vigilant in this regard. We are referring to the planned meeting of the heads of government of the three major countries—the United States, Britain, and France—the purpose of which is said to be to draw up a common approach or even a unified attitude in the event of possible great power talks. If this is the case, it means that the Western countries intend to continue to pursue a policy of collusion to harm the Soviet Union.
    It also means that Churchill is in fact departing from the spirit—if not the letter—of his proposed convening of a "highest-level meeting," because such a meeting, since it is to include the Soviet Union, can only be held if all participating parties do not put forward any fixed demands in advance. However, the purpose of the planned three-country summit is clearly to set out such demands in order to put them forward to the Soviet Union.
    At the same time, the planned three-country preparatory meeting means continuing the previous policy of mutual opposition between countries according to the principles of ideology and social and political systems, which cannot be justified in any way.
    Obviously, the Western countries forming a gang again will not only not help ease international tensions, but will also worsen this situation.
    It is very obvious that no matter what the social systems of various countries are, there are many very important factors on which the interests of the people of these countries are completely consistent. Among these very important factors, the first is peace and the development of trade, economic, and cultural cooperation between the people of all countries in various fields.
    The Soviet Union is always willing to consider any proposals aimed at ensuring peace and promoting the broadest possible economic and cultural relations between countries with the utmost seriousness and sincerity.

    关于目前的国际形势
    ——苏联“真理报”五月二十四日社论
    近几个月来，世界各国都对为解决国际争端而正采取的步骤表现巨大的兴趣。这在当前的情况下是很自然的。
    没有人能够否认，在广泛的国际人士中间，为缓和国际关系中的紧张形势的努力日益增大。在解决争端方面的任何一个前进的步骤，都会减少战争危险，有助于终止使各国招致毁灭的扩张军备运动，并宽慰千百万人的心情。相反地，保持国际紧张局势就意味着进一步加紧进行备战，继续增加军事开支和不断提高主要是压在人民大众肩上的赋税重担。
    在这种情况下，任何一国政府在国际舞台上所采取的任何一个新的步骤，都成为不仅是政府方面而且是最广泛的人士予以密切研究的对象。
    一般人都知道，苏联政府领袖最近发表的表明苏联愿意在有关方面彼此协议的基础上解决国际争端或悬而未决的国际问题的声明，引起了何等的兴趣及同情。这种声明加强了各国人民对于可能解决各项紧迫的国际问题的信心，因为他们知道苏联政府的声明决不与它的真正意图相违背的。
    大家也都知道：关心保卫和平的人认为艾森豪威尔总统在四月十六日发表的演说里面所说的一些话是一种和平姿态。他说：“只要有尊重一切国家权利的意愿，这些问题不问大小没有一个是不可以解决的”，又说“美国愿意尽它应尽的本分”来解决国际争端，可是在同一篇演说里包括的其他论点已使这几句话完全失掉了他们的积极意义。现在必须指出：最近艾森豪威尔在五月二十日发表的声明中，已没有一点那种和平姿态的痕迹，更说不上以行动来加强这种姿态了。
    英国首相邱吉尔最近在下院发表的演说（在这篇演说中，他谈到一些迫切的国际问题）以及对这篇演说进行的辩论，不仅在英国而且在远离英国的一些地方引起了注意。这是十分自然的事。
    英国首相在许多点上支持美国政府的立场。但是他的演说也反映出英国立场和美国立场之间在某些最重要的问题上的分歧。
    邱吉尔演说的相当一大部分，谈到与苏联的关系。他在这方面所谈到的，并不是每一点都能够为苏联的公众舆论所接受而不提出批评和严重的反对意见。但是在目前，首要的并不是指出我们和英国首相意见不同的地方。更为重要的是强调那些能促进争论中的国际问题的解决而有利于和平与各国安全的地方。
    邱吉尔的演说包含了一些提法，这些提法反映出英国人民争取和平的努力，并且证明英国首相在估计目前国际局势的某些重要因素时采取的现实态度。对维护和平感觉兴趣的广大公众都对这些提法表示赞同。同时，这些提法也正受到那些特别想保持目前国际局势中紧张状态的人们的攻击，特别是在美国。
    值得注意的是邱吉尔所发表的下列言论：
    “我不相信使苏联的安全和西欧的自由与安全协调一致这样重大的问题，是不能解决的。”这种言论不能不得到真正努力解决迫切的国际问题并厌恶战争——战争将给各国带来无法估量的灾祸，特别是在目前的情况下更是如此——的人们的同情。
    在我们的国家里，邱吉尔的上述言论已经引起了注意，并被认为是目前国际局势中的一个及时的步骤。
    首相宣称有可能使苏联与西欧各国的“安全”“协调一致”，当然是从他本国的利益出发的。同时，没有疑问，旨在把英国的国家利益与保持和平和加强国际合作的利益结合起来的政策，将得到苏联和其他爱好和平的各国人民的了解和支持。
    邱吉尔所提出的使苏联的安全与西欧的安全协调一致的提法，是有着格外重要的意义的，因为英国首相提出了这个问题，就不仅接触到大不列颠与苏联之间的关系，并且也接触到保持和加强和平的问题。
    目前国际形势的特点是，必须解决的各种问题是很复杂的，这使人们必须对那些人给以正当的了解，他们认为：要企图一下子讨论和解决一切争论着的和悬而未决的问题，是注定要失败的。在解决像朝鲜战争或德国问题之类的困难问题中获得进展，就可以便利缓和目前国际形势的紧张局面，并也可为解决其他问题准备基础。当邱吉尔讲下面的话时，他心目中也许就是怀着这种解决国际问题的态度；他说：“我认为如果以为除非每个问题都获得解决，便不能与苏联解决任何问题，这种想法是错误的。解决两三起我们的困难将是对每一个爱好和平的国家的重要收获。”
    朝鲜问题是最重要的国际问题之一，它的和平解决是一切国家的人民所关心的。
    大家知道，中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所提出的并为苏联所支持的外交倡议，已为达成停战和结束朝鲜战争提供了真正的可能。
    根据已达成的协议，病伤战俘的交换已经实施了。关于全部战俘遣返的问题的谈判，已于四月二十六日在板门店恢复了。中朝方面所提出的建议，特别是最近的五月七日建议，正如对一切没有偏见的人昭然若揭的那样，为实际解决这个阻碍达成停战从而结束朝鲜战争的最后问题，提供了必要的基础。
    邱吉尔主张对朝中方面所提的建议进行耐心而同情的考虑。他说：“目前以我之见，我们没有理由认为这不可能成为达成协议的基础。”
    邱吉尔的这篇声明以及英国下院一些议员尖锐地批评那些正在阻挠板门店谈判的“联合国军司令部”代表们的发言，反映了对于拖延朝鲜问题的解决的不满，反映了英国社会各阶层中日益增长的不满。对平壤和其他朝鲜城市和乡村、对安东等中国城市的继续野蛮轰炸，以及美国将军哈利逊旨在破坏板门店谈判的态度，已在英国和其他国家内引起了正当的愤怒和抗议。
    尼赫鲁总理日前在印度人民院发表演说时表示，哈利逊的立场也显然违反了联合国去年年底所通过的关于朝鲜战俘问题的决议。尼赫鲁直接说，朝中方面的建议应该作为谈判的基础，他并且希望可以作为解决问题的基础。然而，由于哈利逊所采取的态度，板门店的谈判又拖下来了。
    在这种情况之下，著名工党领袖艾德礼在下院对板门店谈判的进程明白表示不满，是完全可以理解的。
    德国问题在邱吉尔的演说中占着特殊地位。他很正确地把这叫作欧洲的“主要问题”。但是，如果情形是这样的话，邱吉尔对德国问题的考虑应该在他的演说中具有特殊重要性了。然而，据邱吉尔在这方面表示的考虑看来，却怎么也不能认为他表示了解决上述“主要”的国际问题的真正愿望。值得注意的是，邱吉尔甚至并不觉得必须提一下雅尔塔协定和波茨坦协定，原先拟定这两项文件的时候他是亲自参加了的，而且这两项文件也规定了以恢复德国统一、使它成为一个爱好和平和民主的国家来真正解决德国问题的重大原则。
    上述国际文件的历史意义在于，它们表现了西方国家和苏联在德国问题上取得了协调的政策和具体的协议，这是在战争期间就取得，而在战争结束之后马上加以肯定的。在这种意义上来说，上述关于促使德国统一成为爱好和平与民主的国家的协议在“使苏联的安全和西欧的自由与安全协调一致”方面是最重大的成就。
    就是在今天，我们也不能不关切地注意，自从英国首相发表演说以来英国在国际关系方面所采取的步骤到底有多大程度符合于这些由大国签署的协定的主要原则，它们之间的新协议到底有多大程度能促进国际和平和安全。
    然而，近年来的经验证明，西方国家片面地拒绝执行它们所缔结的协定，就妨碍了争执和相持不下的问题的解决。毫无疑问，假如大国之间关于重大国际问题的协议得到执行，目前的整个国际局势就会完全是另外一个样子，也就不会有目前这样尖锐和紧张的局势了。
    谈到这里，我们必须谈一谈，为什么邱吉尔会觉得需要提一下声名狼藉的一九二五年洛迦诺公约。照他说，这个公约的基础是这样一个“简单的规定”，就是说假如德国攻击法国，英国就帮助法国，假如法国攻击德国，英国就帮助德国。邱吉尔却没有说明，洛迦诺体系当时实际助长了德国军国主义的侵略野心。这个公约限制德国在西方的行动自由，却让它在东方有行动的自由，把德国的侵略指向苏联。大家都知道，洛迦诺政策是造成第二次世界大战的一个不小的因素。
    历史表明：只要德国的军国主义复仇分子被给以行动的自由，只要没有采取可以确保德国沿着和平的路线发展的有效措施，那么，德国的军国主义就会颇快地复活起来，而且，不论什么形式上的保证和义务，都不能使德国的邻国相信它们的安全是有保障的，不能使它们相信它们不再一次地受到德国侵略的威胁。
    应该指出，就是从大不列颠自身的安全利益出发，洛迦诺公约看来也是软弱无力的，至于从其他欧洲国家特别是像法国、比利时、荷兰、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等一切与德国为邻的国家的安全出发，那就更不待说了；因为打算恢复到洛迦诺公约的企图会引起国际间大规模的捭阖纵横，让一些国家结成变化不定的组合和集团，来反对其他一些国家，而其结果就会不可避免地要加重而不是缓和国际的紧张局势。
    实在说，对于今天的德国，怎么能够实现洛迦诺公约的思想呢？邱吉尔在谈到洛迦诺的思想的时候，对于重建德国统一的问题一字不提，而这个问题不仅对于德国本身来说，而且对于确保欧洲和全世界的安全来说，都是有着决定性意义的。
    邱吉尔在暗示地谈到现在正在采取的关于缔结波恩条约和巴黎条约的片面行动的时候，是要英国政府的政策巩固德国的分裂。不仅如此，从他的演说可以看出，他不仅把德国的分裂看作既成事实，而且看作是人们可以而且应该同意的一种发展。
    邱吉尔说：“英国女皇政府的政策是在精神上和在明文上最忠诚地坚守我们与西德签订的协定。”这位首相强调说：“我们决不会不履行我们对西德所承担的义务。”
    按照他的这些话，难道不就是说大国间为了建立一个统一的爱好和平的民主的德国而签订的协定中的明文和精神要被那些片面签订的协定的明文和精神所牺牲掉吗？而这些片面协定的内容都是批准德国分裂、批准西德重新军国主义化、并且把德国这一部分变成军国主义和侵略的复仇主义的温床。
    邱吉尔断言苏联政策引起了德国问题的严重化，我们且把这种完全不正确的断定撇开不谈。苏联的权威发言人已经不止一次地说明了造成目前德国情势的真正原因，这里无需再去重复这些话了。邱吉尔为了把东德的情势作否定的叙述而说的颇为强硬的话，我们也撇开不谈。自然，我们可以使用一些同样锐利但要真实得多的话来说明西德的情势，但是目前的旨趣并不是互相口角。
    大家都会明白，德国的分裂就意味着在欧洲的心脏把一个战争温床恢复起来，德国人民不会甘心失去他们在差不多一世纪以前用了巨大的努力和牺牲得来的统一。所以关于德国的主要工作，就是结束德国目前的分裂状态，按照大国间缔结的波茨坦协定的基本原则来准备和缔结一个能够保证建立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国的对德和约。
    防止德国军国主义的复活，应当是曾经不止一次受到德国侵略的国家的主要关心所在。此外，应当给德国人民保证有发展他们国家的和平工业的一切条件，保证使德国能按照它的工业和技术水准参加世界经济生活、进一步发展它的丰富的民族文化的一切条件。
    在这方面，新的和约应当避免凡尔赛制度的错误，这种制度的目的是要奴役一个大国。大家知道，凡尔赛制度的创始人关心的是防止德国在经济上重新成为世界市场的竞争者，而不是真正防止德国的重新军国主义化。
    由于邱吉尔躲避德国的统一和缔结对德和约这一类至关重要的问题，由于他强调英国政府将坚持它最近对西德片面承担的义务，邱吉尔就使那些希望在他的演说中看到一种解决世界现存分歧的真正愿望的人们感到惶惑。
    值得注意的是，邱吉尔甚至于连一九四二年在伦敦签订的目的在于防止新的德国侵略的英苏互助条约也没有提到。这个条约正是为了加强英苏两国的安全而缔结的，并且它的精神完全符合关于德国问题的主要国际文件，包括波茨坦协定在内。
    邱吉尔在演说中提到奥地利问题，他说缔结对奥和约也有助于减轻目前的国际紧张局势。在这一点上，必须着重指出：对奥和约问题的迟迟不得解决，应当由美、英、法三国政府负直接责任，它们不仅在四大国以前已经协议的态度上表现了严重的动摇，而且直接背弃了这个态度。
    事情达到了这种程度，三个西方国家拒绝四大国在经过长期讨论之后差不多已完全取得协议的对奥和约原文。它们反对这个取得协议的条约原文，而提出了它们所谓“简要条约”，这个条约是在没有苏联参加的情况下草拟的，它严重地侵犯了苏联的权利，也侵犯了奥地利人民的民主权利。
    所有这一切表明，要消除缔结对奥和约的障碍，到底要决定于谁。
    在英国下院进行辩论时，有些议员着重指出英国首相在他的报告中没有提到中国这件事实。他们提出这一点是很有理由的。
    中国人民开始走上社会进步的康庄大道，这是整个国际局势中的一个重要的变化。自然，英国首相是不可能注意不到这一点的。虽然邱吉尔这一次没有谈到中国问题，但是工党领袖艾德礼在下院说，不可能忽视伟大的中华人民共和国的合法权利与利益。
    艾德礼说：“中国应在安全理事会内取得它应得的地位。看来中国的确是在发展为一个很有能力的国家。它理应成为五大国之一。”
    当然，艾德礼说这种话，并不是由于对共产主义有任何同情（只有麦卡锡可能这样猜疑他），而是由于英国的实际经济利益，而大家知道经济利益就是政治利益的基础。艾德礼对于为什么英国注意解决与中国的关系问题，提出了最合理的解释。他强调说，英国要扩大与美国的贸易的希望，已经大大地减少了，同时美国的“援助”补偿不了由于贸易的减少而引起的损失。艾德礼所坚持的主张是“要贸易，不要援助”，从英国的切身利益（而且不仅是英国的利益）来看，这种主张只能被认为是合理的。艾德礼颇为愤恨地指责英国的海外盟国说：“我们常常被极力要求，不要与中国进行贸易，甚至那些与战争力量很少关系的货物的贸易。像对别人一样，这个中国事件的解决，对我们是有切身利害关系的。”
    另一个著名的工党党员、工党内部的反对派领袖比万最近也发表了谈话，他甚至更强调解决与中国的关系问题的迫切性。
    邱吉尔的反共情绪也许并不亚于其他某些西方政治家的反共情绪，他们认为“莫斯科在指挥着”殖民地和半殖民地的所有民族解放运动。但是，从他的演说里可以明显地看出来，他并没有表现出这种情绪。例如，下面的话就证明了这一点：“我应该说，我认为——我不揣冒昧地发表我的意见——越盟军的部队突然向泰国边境前进，不应该使我们得出一个结论，说这是苏联所鼓动的行动。”
    如果西方政治家在估计亚洲或世界其他任何地区越来越增长的民族运动和民族解放运动的原因时更多地考虑实际的事实，那末，“西方”与“东方”之间互相谅解的机会也就越大，避免不必要的纠纷和流血的可能性也就越大。
    应当指出：不像其他资本主义国家的领袖，邱吉尔并不只是一般地说应该和平解决国际关系中目前的分歧。他还对检查迫切的国际问题的方法，提出了建设性的建议。
    邱吉尔说：“应该迅速召开一次主要国家间的最高级会议，不要延搁太久。”“这种会议应尽可能地限于最少数的国家和人员参加。这种会议应采取非正式的方式举行，但是应该具有较大程度的秘密性和隐蔽性。”
    显然，邱吉尔不像西方其他某些政治家那样，并没有规定一方必须承担任何义务作为召开会议的建议的先决条件。
    邱吉尔多年参加处理国际事务所积累的丰富经验，显然使他不致产生一种基本的错误概念，以为一方能在和平时期强使另外一方，而且是像苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟这样一方，接受在悬而未决的国际问题上取得协议的先决条件。邱吉尔不能不考虑到国际关系常例中一个大家都知道的事实：只有在战争时期，战胜一方才能强使战败一方接受谈判的先决条件，要不然就是两方实力悬殊，强者想要占弱者的便宜而扬言进行一场后者力所不及的战争来迫使它接受专横的“和平”条款。
    我们必须指出邱吉尔建议的重要性，这个建议显然是以他在不久以前一段时期内与重要的政治家直接接触的经验为基础。这个建议在世界上许多国家中引起了热烈的良好的评论，这就证明了它的重要意义。
    例如，邱吉尔演说中提出的至少解决几个基本问题从而缓和国际紧张局势的要求，在今天的形势下，就是十分适合时宜的。
    美国国务院在五月十三日就英国首相的演说发表声明；而且据说艾森豪威尔总统是同意这篇声明的内容的。关于邱吉尔所建议的召开一个人数不多的政治家会议的可能性，国务院并没有加以否认。然而它根据某种理由又对苏联一国提出了那种无人不知的先决条件的主张。看来苏联还必须再作些事情来保证板门店谈判的成功以及对奥和约问题的解决。虽然，过去的一切情况表现得十分明显，在这两个问题上对于不论哪一个问题一直不曾尽到他们的“应尽的本分”的不是苏联而是美国和英国。
    从报章的评论和美国国务院的声明中看得很清楚，为英国政党重要领袖所支持的邱吉尔的主张，却遇到了美国某些高级人士的“有保留的”甚至“冷淡的”反应。英美政治家意见的某些分歧可能是表现得越来越突出的两国经济矛盾的结果，而这种矛盾在很大程度上又是与美国限制和西欧国家贸易的苛刻政策有关的。
    至于苏联，苏联的舆论除了像上面所谈到的对于邱吉尔一些具体的提法抱着相反的看法以外，它对邱吉尔演说里面所包括的某些建设性的因素，是感到兴趣的。将来就可看出这些因素究竟在多大的程度上表现出以邱吉尔为首的英国政府的真正意图。
    人们必须承认，现在已经有一些征兆，不能不使苏联人民和正在保卫着和平事业的国际人士在这方面提起警惕。我们是指计划中的三大国——美国、英国和法国——政府首脑的会议，这个会议的目的据说是要拟出一个在一旦举行可能的大国会谈时的共同方针或甚至一致的态度。如果真是这样的话，这就意味着西方国家打算继续推行共谋而损害苏联的方针。
    这也意味着邱吉尔事实上是正在离开他所提出的召开一个“最高级会议”的建议的精神——如果说不是字面的话——因为这种会议既然要苏联参加，就只有参加各方不预先提出任何固定的要求才能举行。然而，计划中的三大国首脑会议的目的，显然是要定出这种要求以便向苏联提出。
    同时，计划中的三国预备会议意味着继续以往的、无论如何辩护不了的、各国按照思想体系和社会与政治制度的原则而互相对立的方针。
    显然，西方国家再一次结成一伙，不但不会帮助缓和国际紧张局势，反而会使这种局势更加恶化。
    非常明显，无论各国的社会制度有着怎样的不同，但是不少非常重要的因素，在这些因素上，这些国家人民的利益是完全一致的。在这些非常重要的因素中，首先就是和平以及发展各国人民在贸易、经济和文化各方面的合作。
    苏联经常愿意极其严肃极其真诚地考虑任何以保证和平和促进各国间尽可能广泛的经济与文化关系为其目的的建议。
