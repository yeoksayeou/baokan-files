Xinhua News Agency, London, May 28th: There has been increasing discussion in the British bourgeois press lately regarding the Eisenhower administration's inconsistent and self-serving words and deeds in foreign trade policy.

The so-called "Chief Joseph Dam" contracting incident that occurred not long ago is one of the things the British bourgeoisie has been frequently complaining about recently. In the bidding for the electrical engineering installation of the "Chief Joseph Dam" in Washington State, USA, a British electrical company's bid was one million US dollars cheaper than the American company's, but the US authorities refused to let the British company undertake the contract. British newspapers believe this is an example of the US government talking about "free" trade but actually adopting discriminatory policies.

On April 28, the "Financial Times," one of the important mouthpieces of British capitalists, mentioned another matter: Pan American Airlines of the United States ordered three "Comet-3" passenger planes from the British de Havilland Aircraft Company, but the purchase contract could not be signed because the US Civil Aviation Administration did not recognize the certificate of airworthiness issued by Britain for this type of aircraft.

British newspapers have also been reporting with resentment recently on the debate in the US Congress regarding the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. Since Eisenhower came to power, the so-called "protectionist" forces in the United States have become increasingly powerful. In this still ongoing debate, many US business representatives have requested stronger protection measures. Eisenhower superficially expressed sympathy for the British request to expand trade with the United States, but only suggested to Congress that the current Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which the British already consider unsatisfactory, be extended for one year. This trade act conceals the fact that the United States actually imposes high tariffs on foreign goods under the guise of reciprocity. Almost at the same time, Eisenhower also appointed a protectionist to the Tariff Commission, further encouraging protectionist forces. As a result, dozens of amendments were immediately proposed in Congress, the most famous of which is the so-called Simpson Bill. The main content of this bill is to amend the current Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, granting the Tariff Commission the power to increase tariffs, with the aim of strengthening the protective nature of the current trade act. This bill also specifically stipulates increasing import duties on lead and zinc, and restricting the import quota of crude oil and fuel oil.

The US House Ways and Means Committee began debating the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act on April 27, giving priority to those who support the Simpson Bill to speak. The "Financial Times" pointed out that the first person to appear to defend the Simpson Bill was a famous professional protectionist, O.R. Strackbein. He even demanded that the power granted to the President to restrict agricultural imports be strengthened. The chairman of the committee, Daniel Reed himself, expressed his views at the meeting, demanding that vigilance be maintained against foreign exporters becoming a stronger threat to American industry. He especially drew attention to the statement made by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler in his budget statement that Britain must reduce tax rates to stimulate exports.

The arrogance of the forces in the United States that oppose relaxing trade restrictions and Eisenhower's inconsistent words and deeds have disappointed the British bourgeoisie about the possibility of Britain's hoped-for reciprocal trade development with the United States. The London "Times" published a special commentary on the 7th, which stated: "Since the new US government came to power, American policy seems to have become even worse, and has deviated far from the liberal policy put forward by President Eisenhower in his State of the Union address. ... At present, the most we can hope for is that the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act will be extended unchanged for one year." The British magazine "The Economist" had already pessimistically said: "In the trade prospects, there will be no signs of encouragement for Britain in the near future... There is no reasonable hope for a real reform of tariff procedures and the 'Buy American Act'." The "Manchester Guardian" also recently criticized the US trade policy, complaining that the Eisenhower administration is "not very interested" in relaxing imports. "The Times" also warned the United States that if it opposes relaxing trade restrictions, "the free world will be divided by economic and financial barriers."

    英资产阶级不满美国损人利己的贸易政策
    【新华社二十八日讯】伦敦消息：关于艾森豪威尔政府在对外贸易政策方面所采取的言行不一、损人利己的做法，近来在英国资产阶级报刊上出现越来越多的议论。
    不久以前发生的所谓“大约瑟夫水闸”包工事件，是英国资产阶级最近频频抱怨的一件事情。在安装美国华盛顿州“大约瑟夫水闸”的电气工程投标中，一家英国电气公司的标价比美国公司便宜一百万美元，但是美国当局拒绝让英国公司承包。英国报纸认为这是美国政府口头上讲“自由”贸易，实际上却采取歧视政策的例证。
    四月二十八日英国资本家的重要喉舌之一“金融时报”提到另一件事情：美国泛美航空公司向英国德哈维兰飞机公司订购三架“彗星—三”式载客飞机，由于美国民用航空管理局不承认英国发给这种飞机的适于航空的证件，购货合同无法签订。
    英国报刊近来也以怨恨的口气报道美国国会中关于互惠贸易法案的辩论。自从艾森豪威尔上台以来，美国国内的所谓“保护主义”势力愈来愈得势。在这场还未结束的辩论中，美国许多企业代表纷纷要求加强保护措施。艾森豪威尔表面上表示同情英国提出的扩大对美国贸易的要求，却只向国会建议把英国人已认为不能使他们满意的现行互惠贸易法延长一年。这个贸易法以互惠的名义掩盖了美国实际上对外国货物征收高额关税的事实。差不多在同时，艾森豪威尔还委派了一个保护主义分子到关税委员会里去，更鼓励了保护主义势力。于是在国会里立即就提出了几十个修正案，其中最出名的就是所谓辛普生法案。这个法案的主要内容是修改现行互惠贸易法，给予关税委员会以增加关税的权力，目的在加强现行贸易法的保护性质。这个法案还具体规定增加铅和锌的进口税，并且对原油及燃料用油的入口定额加以限制。
    美国众议院筹款委员会从四月二十七日开始就互惠贸易法案进行辩论，给支持辛普生法案的人以优先发言的机会。“金融时报”指出，头一个出席为辛普生法案辩护的就是一个著名的职业保护主义分子奥·鲁·斯特勒克宾。他甚至还要求加强法案授予总统的限制农产品入口的权力。这个委员会的主席丹尼尔·李德本人在会上表示意见，要求提防外国出口商成为美国工业更强大的威胁力量。他特别提醒注意英国财政大臣巴特勒在预算声明中所说英国必须减低税率以刺激出口的话。
    美国国内反对放宽贸易限制的势力的嚣张以及艾森豪威尔的言行不符的做法，已使英国资产阶级对于英国所希望的和美国发展互惠贸易的可能感到失望。伦敦“泰晤士报”七日特地发表了一篇评论，其中说：“自从美国新政府上台之后，美国的政策似乎更变本加厉地坏下去了，而且远远地背弃了艾森豪威尔总统在他的国情咨文中提出的自由主义政策。……目前，我们所能希望的最多是把互惠贸易法原封不动地延长一年。”英国“经济学家”杂志早就悲观地说：“在贸易的前景中，最近的将来不会有任何给英国一些鼓励的征候……对于真正改革关税手续和‘买美国货法’一事不能寄予什么合理的希望。”“曼彻斯特卫报”最近也批评美国的贸易政策，抱怨艾森豪威尔政府对放宽进口“不大感到兴趣”。“泰晤士报”还警告美国说，如果它反对放宽贸易限制，“自由世界将由于经济和金融的壁垒陷于分裂”。
