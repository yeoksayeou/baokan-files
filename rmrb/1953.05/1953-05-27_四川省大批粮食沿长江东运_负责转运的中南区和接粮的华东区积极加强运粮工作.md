Large Quantities of Grain from Sichuan Province Transported Eastward Along the Yangtze River
Central South and East China Regions Actively Strengthen Grain Transport Work

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Southwest Region is vigorously transferring grain to East China and other regions. The April transfer plan was completed by 112.07 percent. As of mid-May, 77.67 percent of the May transfer plan has been completed. Currently, large quantities of grain are being continuously transported eastward along the Yangtze River from Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance." The first batch of grain has been transported to grain-needing areas such as Jiangsu and Anhui.

In order to complete the important task of transporting grain for disaster relief, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Sichuan Provincial People's Government Financial and Economic Committee convened a meeting in Chengdu with the deputy commissioners and grain bureau chiefs of the six special districts with transfer tasks: Yibin, Luxian, Nanchong, Wanxian, Daxian, and Fuling. The meeting studied the central government's transfer plan, allocated specific grain transport figures by month and region, and adjusted transportation costs differently according to varying transport conditions in areas with difficult mountain transport, hilly areas and general mountainous areas, and areas with convenient transportation. A Sichuan Provincial Grain Transport Command was established at the meeting, with Liu Yunsheng, Director of the Provincial Grain Bureau, and Wang Changnian, Deputy Director of the Provincial Communications Department, serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. It was also decided that the six special districts with transfer tasks, Yibin, etc., and their subordinate 39 counties, would each establish a transfer command and office, with the deputy commissioner, deputy county head, and grain bureau chief serving as the commander and deputy commander. The task of transferring grain from the Southwest Region is very heavy, estimated to require 7.32 million workdays to complete. Therefore, the meeting focused on studying the organization and leadership of the grain transport laborers and formulated the following specific measures: 1. Tea and water stations will be set up every 15 li, with temporary sheds built for laborers to rest and stay overnight; 2. Medical stations will be set up at longer midpoints and grain delivery points; 3. Elderly people, children, and pregnant women are prohibited from transporting grain; 4. Strengthen the organization of the starting and delivery points, increase the number of weighing personnel, and ensure that laborers are not delayed in loading and unloading; 5. Dispatch hundreds of cadres to participate in the grain transport work and inspect road and water traffic and specific work; 6. Strengthen the organization and management of motor vehicles and wooden boats; 7. Reduce the size of grain delivery organizations, generally not exceeding 20 to 30 people per group. Before the summer harvest and during the busy farming season in September, priority will be given to transporting grain along the river to avoid interfering with agricultural timing. Each laborer will not transport grain for more than five days per month to ensure that "production and grain transport do not interfere with each other."

The Central South and East China regions, responsible for transshipment and receiving grain, have also successively established grain transfer agencies to strengthen inter-administrative region transportation links. The Yangtze River Navigation Administration and Minsheng Company mobilized all available steamships and tugboats capable of navigating the Sichuan River to specifically travel the Chongqing-Yichang section, accelerating the transfer. Yichang Port in Hubei, which bears the important transshipment task, has also strengthened the leadership of the docks and vigorously improved workers' loading and unloading operations. Loading and unloading efficiency has improved significantly. In March, the hourly rate was 519 kilograms per worker. From April 21st to 25th, the average hourly rate was 1,090 kilograms, with a maximum record of 1,645 kilograms. This guaranteed the completion of the April transfer task of Sichuan grain in Yichang. Since late April, East China has organized a strong transportation force to transfer grain. Workers in railways, automobiles, wooden boats, and transportation departments have launched rapid transportation competitions in order to transport grain to grain-needing areas as soon as possible. The timely arrival of this grain in grain-needing areas has greatly encouraged disaster-stricken farmers to overcome disasters and strive to achieve this year's bumper autumn harvest plan.

    四川省大批粮食沿长江东运
    负责转运的中南区和接粮的华东区积极加强运粮工作
    【本报讯】西南区大力向华东等地调运粮食。四月份的调运计划完成了百分之一百一十二点零七，五月份的调运计划，到中旬为止，已完成百分之七十七点六七。目前，大批粮食正由素称“天府之国”的四川陆续沿长江东运。第一批粮食已运到江苏、安徽等需粮地区。
    为了完成运粮救灾的重要任务，中共四川省委和四川省人民政府财政经济委员会曾召集了有调运任务的宜宾、泸县、南充、万县、达县、涪陵等六个专署的副专员和粮食局局长到成都开会。会议研究了中央的调运计划，按月份地区分配了具体运粮数字；又按照大山难运区、丘陵地区及一般山地、交通便利地区等不同的运输条件，有差别地调整了运输费用。会上成立了四川省运粮指挥部，由省粮食厅厅长刘运生、交通厅副厅长王长年分任正副指挥；并决定有调运任务的宜宾等六个专署及所属三十九个县，都分别成立调运指挥部及办公室，由副专员、副县长及粮食局局长任正副指挥。西南区调运粮食的任务很重，估计需要七百三十二万个工才能完成任务，因此会议着重地研究了对运粮民工的组织领导，并订出了下列具体办法：一、每隔十五里设茶水站，搭盖临时草棚，供民工休息与夜宿；二、在较长中途及交粮点设置医疗站；三、禁止老人、小孩及孕妇运粮；四、加强起运点和交粮点的组织，增加过秤人员，保证不耽误民工起卸；五、调派数百个干部，参加运粮工作，检查水陆交通及具体工作；六、加强汽车和木船的组织管理工作；七、缩小民工送粮组织，一般每组不超过二十人至三十人。在六月半以前和九月份等农忙季节，先运沿江之粮，以便作到不违农时；每一劳动力每月运粮不超过五日，以保证“生产运粮两不误”。
    负责转运及接粮的中南、华东地区，也都先后成立了粮食调运机构，加强了大行政区间运输的联系。长江航务管理局和民生公司动员所有能行驶川江的轮船拖驳，专门航行重庆宜昌段，加速运转。负有重大转运任务的湖北宜昌港，也加强了码头的领导工作和大力改进工人装卸操作。装卸效率已有显著的提高，三月份每工时为五百一十九公斤，四月二十一日到二十五日平均每工时为一千零九十公斤，最高纪录达到一千六百四十五公斤。这就保证了四月份川粮由宜昌转运任务的完成。华东各地从四月下旬起就组织了强大的运输力量，转运粮食。铁路、汽车、木船和搬运等部门的工人，都为了及早地把粮食运到需粮地区，开展了快速运输竞赛。这些粮食及时地运到需粮地区，大大鼓舞了受灾农民战胜灾荒争取实现今年大秋丰收计划的信心。
