On the Front Lines of National Economic Construction

The Majority of State-Owned Factories and Mines in Southwest China Complete Their April Plans

The majority of state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region completed their April production plans. According to statistics, among fifty factories and mines, twenty-seven completed or exceeded their monthly plans, and seven completed or nearly completed the production plans for most major products. Out of thirty-eight major products, twenty-six completed their production plans. Among these, steel ingots reached 113.86%, steel rails reached 106.52%, coal reached 106.24%, electricity reached 100.77%, electrolytic copper reached 109.56%, and cotton yarn reached 104.51%.

The production situation of state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region in April showed progress compared to previous months. Although the output in April was slightly lower than in March, the quality of many major products improved significantly. For example, the quality of major products such as electric furnace steel ingots and steel billets from Factory 102, open-hearth steel ingots and track spikes from Factory 101, open-hearth steel ingots from Factory 104, and electrolytic copper from Factory 103 all exceeded national standards. At the same time, the phenomenon of rushing to complete tasks, workers working overtime, frequent accidents, and poor product quality, which were prevalent in March, was greatly reduced in April in various factories and mines. This is because most factories and mines initially mobilized employees to discuss the production plans for the second quarter or April, and the employees gradually established the concept of actively completing national plans.

Currently, the phenomenon of uneven production, with a slack beginning and a tight end, is still common in various factories and mines in the Southwest. To change this phenomenon, it is necessary to further establish planned management step by step and fully tap and utilize potential strengths, based on deeply mobilizing employees to discuss national plans.

Northeast China to Train Over 85,000 Technical Workers This Year

To meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, Northeast China will train over 85,000 various technical workers for basic construction and industrial and agricultural production this year.

Currently, many modern factories, mines, and power stations in Northeast China are successively commencing basic construction projects. Factories, power stations, and other facilities that have already been built will also be put into production one after another. There is also significant development in the promotion of new technologies in agriculture. Therefore, mass training of technical workers has become an extremely urgent task. To enable new workers to reach a level of technical theory and independent operation within a relatively short period, the work of training technical workers this year will mainly adopt the method of training according to different types of work. At present, twenty-three one-year technical schools and over one hundred half-year technical training classes have been established throughout the region. These technical schools and training classes will train over 44,400 workers in electromechanical engineering, driving, as well as metal structure and drilling, and other complex technologies this year. Another training method is to have veteran technicians mentor apprentices. In this area, over 40,700 technical workers will also be trained this year. To enable apprentices to have a preliminary understanding of the significance of large-scale economic construction and general technical operation knowledge, within one or two months before signing the apprenticeship contract, apprentices will also receive training in relevant political, technical security, labor discipline, and technical operation theory.

At present, various regions and units are preparing to establish management agencies specifically responsible for training technical workers. To solve the problem of student sources, the labor bureaus of governments at all levels in Northeast China have already contacted relevant departments and plan to uniformly allocate young people with upper primary and lower primary education levels from rural and urban areas to participate in this study.

A Certain Small Open-Hearth Furnace at Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant Continuously Creates Excellent Smelting Records

A certain small open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking workshop of the Chongqing State-Owned No. 101 Steel Plant has recently continuously created excellent smelting records.

Since the beginning of May, a heated labor competition has unfolded among the three shifts responsible for smelting at this small open-hearth furnace. On May 2nd, Wu Shunzhi's shift first created an outstanding record of smelting a furnace of steel in three hours and fifty-eight minutes, breaking the record of four hours and two minutes that Zhang Wenjin's shift had consistently maintained in April. The next day, Zhang Wenjin's shift immediately achieved a new record of three hours and forty-eight minutes, regaining the honor of being the new record creator. Daily output increased by 28% compared to the planned amount. However, on the third day, a new record of only three hours and twenty-three minutes for smelting a furnace of steel emerged, and the creator of this new record was Luo Shubao's shift. The three smelting shifts continued to compete to shorten the time by even a minute. After that, the average smelting time for each furnace was maintained at around three hours and forty-five minutes. Before March, the smelting time for each furnace was generally around five hours. The competition among the three smelting shifts is a competition of unity, and their goal is to better complete the national plan for May. Therefore, they all paid attention to protecting the furnace body and carefully informed the next shift of the smelting situation and what should be noted in the next shift during shift handover. The competition among the three smelting shifts has also achieved the hard-working cooperation of the post-furnace shifts and the gas furnace shift. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Yang Yuzhong Drilling Team of Datong Coal Mine Creates New Record of 316 Days of Safe Operation

The Yang Yuzhong drilling team of the Datong Coal Mine drilling team, as of May 7th of this year, has created a new record of 316 days of safe operation without accidents. This team uses Soviet-style 500-meter drilling rigs and has exceeded its drilling tasks every month, with one month drilling 300 meters. Their coal core sampling rate for the first quarter averaged 60%, and the rock core sampling rate was above 90%. Due to the significant achievement of safe drilling, the Yang Yuzhong team has been rated as a model team in Shanxi Province and has won the Safe Drilling Red Flag at the National Coal Mine Drilling Conference.

Strictly adhering to operating procedures is the main reason why the Yang Yuzhong team can drill safely. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Inner Mongolia Sees First State-Owned Mechanized Farm

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has seen its first state-owned mechanized farm—the Najitun Mechanized Farm. This spring, the farm used machinery to sow more than 660 hectares (one hectare is fifteen Chinese mu) of wheat and soybeans. Now, the wheat has emerged more than three inches, and the wheat seedlings are arranged densely and neatly. More than 80 hectares of land have also been plowed and will be sown with corn and sorghum soon.

The Najitun Mechanized Farm was formerly known as the Nawen Farm. In 1949, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region chose Najitun, the former site of the A Rong Banner People's Government of the Hulunbuir League, as the farm site, and reclaimed a large area of ​​land near Xinmin Village, 18 miles away from Najitun, and began cultivating crops the following year. The results of three years of cultivation have proved that the grassland, once known as the "Great Northern Wilderness," has fertile soil and can grow excellent crops. In the past, the farm used horse-drawn machines and old-style farm tools and cattle for cultivation, in addition to some mechanical operations. Since last autumn, the farm has continuously increased combines (combine harvesters), weeders, etc., and has been using mechanical operations entirely since this spring, and the farm has also been officially renamed.

The farm's mechanics and agricultural workers are all children of farmers and herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Four of the seven tractor drivers are Mongolian and three are Han.

The Najitun Mechanized Farm helps local farmers improve their cultivation techniques and points out the prospects for agricultural mechanization to the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. This spring, the farmers near the farm followed the farm to advance the planting time by a week and learned from the farm's methods of fertilization and seed selection. Farmers who previously did not know how to grow wheat also followed the farm to sow wheat after seeing the farm's wheat harvest. Farmers of all ethnic groups also organized visits to the farm's mechanical operations. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    西南大部国营厂矿完成四月份计划
    西南区大部分国营厂矿完成四月份生产计划。据统计，在五十个厂矿中，完成或超额完成月计划的有二十七个厂矿，完成或接近完成多数主要产品生产计划的有七个厂矿。在三十八种主要产品中，有二十六种完成了生产计划。其中，钢锭完成百分之一百一十三点八六，钢轨完成百分之一百零六点五二，煤完成百分之一百零六点二四，电完成百分之一零零点七七，电解铜完成百分之一百零九点五六，棉纱完成百分之一百零四点五一。
    西南区国营厂矿四月份的生产情况较以前有进步，虽然四月份的产量比三月份略有降低，但是不少主要产品的质量有显著的改进。如一○二钢铁厂的电炉钢锭、钢胚，一○一钢铁厂的平炉钢锭、道钉，一○四钢铁厂的平炉钢锭和一零三厂的电解铜等主要产品的质量，都超过了国家规定的标准。同时，各厂矿在四月份中，像三月份那样突击赶任务、让工人加班加点、事故多、产品质量坏的现象已大为减少。这是因为大部分厂矿初步发动职工讨论了第二季度或四月份的生产计划，职工们逐步树立了积极完成国家计划的观念。
    西南各厂矿目前还普遍存在前松后紧的生产不均衡的现象，为了改变这种现象，应该进一步在深入发动职工讨论国家计划的基础上，有步骤地建立计划管理，充分地挖掘和发挥潜在力量。
    东北区今年将训练八万五千多技术工人
    为适应大规模经济建设的需要，东北区今年将训练八万五千多个基本建设和工农业生产的各种技术工人。
    目前，东北区许多现代化的工厂、矿山和发电站等基本建设工程相继开工，已经建设起来的工厂、发电站等也要陆续投入生产，农业方面新技术的推广也有很大发展。因此，大量培养技术工人已成为十分迫切的任务。为了在较短时间内使新的工人达到具有一定技术理论和独立操作的水平，今年培养技术工人的工作，主要是采取按不同工种进行训练的办法。目前，全区已举办了二十三处一年制的技工学校和一百多所半年一期的技术训练班。这些技工学校和训练班，今年将培养四万四千四百多个机电工、司机以及金属结构和钻探等复杂技术的工人。另一种培养的办法，是由老技工带徒弟。在这一方面，今年也将培养四万零七百多个技术工人。为了使徒工们初步了解大规模经济建设的意义和一般的技术操作知识，在签订师徒合同以前的一两个月内，徒工们还要受有关政治、技术保安、劳动纪律、技术操作理论等方面的训练。
    目前，各地区、各单位都已准备设立专门负责训练技术工人的管理机构。为解决学员来源的问题，东北各级人民政府的劳动局已经和各有关部门取得联系，计划从农村和城市中统一调配具有高小和初小文化程度的青年来参加这一学习。

    重庆一零一钢铁厂某号小型平炉连续创造优异的冶炼纪录
    重庆国营一零一钢铁厂炼钢场某号小型平炉，最近连续创造了优异的冶炼纪录。
    五月份开始以后，担任这个小型平炉冶炼的三个班之间展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。五月二日，吴顺志班首先创造了三小时五十八分冶炼一炉钢的出色纪录，突破张文金班在四月份内始终保持着的四时零二分的纪录。第二天，张文金班立刻又以三小时四十八分的新纪录取得了新纪录创造者的这个荣誉。日产量比计划量提高了百分之二十八。但是到了第三天，冶炼一炉钢只用三小时二十三分的最新纪录又出现了，创造这个新纪录的是罗书宝班。三个冶炼班为了缩短一分钟而继续竞赛着。以后，每炉钢平均都保持在三小时四十五分左右。在三月份以前，每炉钢冶炼时间一般在五小时左右。三个冶炼班的竞赛是团结的竞赛，他们的目标都是为了更好地完成五月份的国家计划。因此他们都注意保护着炉体，在交接班时都认真地告诉上一班冶炼的情况，在下一班应该注意什么。三个冶炼班的竞赛也取得了炉后各班和煤气炉班的努力配合。（据新华社讯）
    大同煤矿杨玉忠钻探组创造安全运转三百十六天新纪录
    大同煤矿钻探队杨玉忠钻探组，到今年五月七日止，已创造了安全运转三百一十六天未发生事故的新纪录。他们这个组使用苏式五百公尺型钻机，每月都超额完成了钻进的任务，并且有一个月钻进了三百公尺。他们第一季度的煤芯采取率平均达到了百分之六十，岩芯采取率在百分之九十以上。由于安全钻进的重大成就，杨玉忠组已被评为山西省模范小组，又在全国煤矿钻探会议上荣获安全钻进红旗。　
    严格遵守操作规程是杨玉忠组能够安全钻进的主要原因。（据新华社讯）
    内蒙古出现第一个国营机械农场
    内蒙古自治区出现了第一个国营机械农场——那吉屯机械农场。今春农场使用机械播种了六百六十多垧（一垧为十五市亩）小麦和大豆。现在，小麦已出土三寸多，麦苗排列紧密整齐。还有八十多垧土地已耕犁完毕，最近即可播种玉米和高粱。
    那吉屯机械农场，原名纳文农场。一九四九年，内蒙古自治区人民政府选择了前呼纳盟阿荣旗旗人民政府所在地的那吉屯为场址，在距那吉屯十八里地的新民屯附近开垦了大片土地，第二年开始耕植作物。三年来耕作的结果证明，这一带曾被称为“北大荒”的草地土质肥沃，可以生长出优良的作物。过去农场除部分使用机械作业外，还使用马拉机和旧式农具及耕牛等耕作。去年秋天以来，农场连续增加了康拜因（联合收割机）、除草机等，从今春起便全部使用机械作业，农场也正式更名。
    农场的机械工人和农业工人，都是内蒙古自治区农、牧民的子弟。七个拖拉机手有四个蒙族、三个汉族。
    那吉屯机械农场帮助当地农民改进耕作技术，并给内蒙各族人民指出了农业机械化的远景。今春农场附近的农民都随着农场把耕种时间提前一周，并学习农场施肥、选种等方法，以前不会种麦的农民看到农场小麦丰收，也跟着播种小麦。各族农民还组织参观农场的机械作业。　（据新华社讯）
