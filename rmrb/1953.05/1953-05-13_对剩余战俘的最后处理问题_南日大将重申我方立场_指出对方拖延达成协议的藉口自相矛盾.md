Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 12th – The Korean and Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communique on May 12th:

The two delegations held a meeting on May 12th.

At the meeting, Chief Delegate General Nam Il reiterated our position of entrusting the issue of remaining prisoners of war to the political conference for resolution, pointing out that our side advocates resolving the issue step by step, paving the way for the resolution of the next stage of the issue in the current stage. The other side, however, is currently contemplating the next stage's problem, insisting groundlessly that the political conference cannot resolve the issue of remaining prisoners of war, thereby preventing all issues from being resolved and making the Korean armistice impossible to achieve. General Nam Il also reiterated our side's new plan of May 7th, which is reasonable and practical for resolving the entire issue of prisoner of war repatriation, replied to the questions raised by the other side on May 11th regarding the reimbursement of expenses of various countries on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission suggested in our new plan, and pointed out that the excuses used by the other side in recent days to delay reaching an agreement are untenable. General Nam Il solemnly suggested that the delegation meeting quickly pass our plan of May 7th in order to enter into specific details and achieve the Korean armistice.

However, at the meeting, the other side, in addition to continuing to repeat the self-contradictory excuses that it had repeatedly repeated for three days and had been fully refuted by our side, did not put forward any positive opinions. Therefore, the meeting on May 12th did not make any progress.

The two sides are scheduled to continue holding a delegation meeting at 11:00 AM on May 13th.

The full text of General Nam Il's main speech at the May 12th meeting is as follows:

"We absolutely cannot agree with your statement that the political conference cannot resolve the final handling of the remaining prisoners of war, and even more so cannot agree to using this as an excuse to delay agreement on our plan. Because by the time the political conference needs to handle this issue, the situation will have completely changed, the war will have ceased, the prisoners of war who insist on repatriation will have been repatriated, and the prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission who are not directly repatriated will have been repatriated after explanations by the relevant parties if they request repatriation. If there are still prisoners of war who have not requested repatriation, the handling of these people is clearly part of the post-war peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, not a matter of armistice, and therefore can only be submitted to the political conference for resolution. The political conference, in the changed circumstances, is fully capable of reasonably resolving this issue. Your side says that because the political conference has to deal with many issues related to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it cannot resolve this issue. In fact, it is precisely because the higher-level political conference is responsible for resolving many issues related to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue that it is fully capable of resolving this issue as well. If the issue of a remaining prisoner of war cannot be resolved, how can it be expected to resolve other more important issues?

We believe that issues need to be resolved step by step, and when resolving the previous stage's problem, the way should be paved for the resolution of the next stage's problem. This is in line with the world's people's desire for peace. But your side's thinking is exactly the opposite. In the previous stage, you assume that the next stage's problem cannot be solved, so that the first stage's problem cannot be solved either, and therefore all problems cannot be solved, making the Korean armistice impossible to achieve. We firmly disagree with your view.

Regarding the issue of reimbursement of expenses of various countries on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission raised by your side yesterday, our side believes that all expenses incurred by the various countries on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in taking care of the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war should be borne by the side to which these prisoners of war belong.

For three days, your side has raised a series of questions to our eight-point plan of May 7th, requesting clarification. No matter how trivial the questions raised by your side, we have given them serious consideration. According to the nature of the questions raised by your side, we have given full answers to those that are of a certain degree of importance and need to be answered specifically at present. However, for purely detailed questions, our side believes that as long as the two sides reach an agreement on the main issues, it is not difficult to find a fair solution for both sides on a reasonable and practical basis, so there is no need to give specific answers at present. This attitude of our side is completely reasonable. Your side believes that these detailed questions cannot be clarified, so the main issues cannot be discussed, which is not credible. May I ask, who would believe that if both sides agree on the time limit for explaining to the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war, it is still necessary to determine the time for explaining to each batch of prisoners of war? Who would believe that without determining the number of people to be explained, it is not possible to determine the main issue of placing the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and allowing the relevant parties to explain? Who would believe that once both sides agree that the member countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should be equipped with an equal number of armed forces, they cannot agree on whether these armed forces are military police or armed civil affairs personnel? Obviously, no one can believe this. Your side does not believe in such things either.

When our side asked your side on May 5th to clarify how the military control of the detaining side can be lifted while maintaining order in the prisoner of war camps when the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war remain with the detaining side, your side said on May 6th: 'It is obviously premature to discuss the details of this issue before the neutral nations are determined to receive them.' Although anyone can judge that the questions raised by our side are not detailed questions, your side calls them details, claiming that it is too early to discuss them before the important issues are decided. But when our side tried to accommodate your side's claim to leave the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea and proposed a reasonable and practical comprehensive plan that solved all the major issues, your side raised some questions that anyone can judge are administrative details, and claimed that these questions cannot be clarified, so the major issues cannot be resolved. We believe that your side's self-contradictory position is completely untenable.

In order to achieve the Korean armistice that the world yearns for, our side has made a series of major efforts since the resumption of the talks. But despite this, for several days, your side has continued to raise trivial issues at the meeting, wasting time. This approach of your side makes it difficult for people to believe that your side is as willing to quickly achieve the Korean armistice as your side claims. For the sake of the people of both sides who have children fighting in Korea and the peace-loving people of the world, we suggest that the delegations of both sides quickly pass our plan of May 7th in order to enter into specific details."

### 对剩余战俘的最后处理问题  南日大将重申我方立场  指出对方拖延达成协议的藉口自相矛盾

    对剩余战俘的最后处理问题
    南日大将重申我方立场
    指出对方拖延达成协议的藉口自相矛盾
    【新华社开城十二日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月十二日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团五月十二日举行会议。
    会上我方首席代表南日大将重申我方将剩余战俘问题交由政治会议解决的立场，指出我方主张逐步解决问题，在现阶段中为下一阶段问题的解决铺平道路。对方则在目前设想下一阶段的问题，要解决毫无根据地坚持政治会议不能解决剩余的战俘问题，从而使所有问题无一得以解决，使朝鲜停战根本不能实现。南日大将并再度说明了我方五月七日的合理而又实际地解决整个战俘遣返问题的新方案，答复了对方五月十一日所提出的关于我方新方案中所建议成立的中立国遣返委员会各国费用的偿还问题，并指出对方连日来用以拖延达成协议的藉口是不能成立的。南日大将郑重建议了代表团大会迅速过通我方五月七日方案，以便进入具体细节的安排，实现朝鲜停战。
    但对方在会上除了继续重复它三天来所一再重复，并已为我方所充分驳斥的自相矛盾的藉口外，没有提出任何积极性的意见。因此五月十二日的会议又未获得任何进展。
    双方定于五月十三日上午十一时继续举行代表团大会。
    南日大将在五月十二日会上主要发言全文如下：
    “我们完全不能同意你方所说政治会议不能解决剩余战俘的最后处理问题的说法，更不能同意以此为藉口拖延对我方方案的协议。因为到政治会议需要处理这个问题的时候，情况完全变了，战争已经停止、坚持遣返的战俘已被遣返，在中立国遣返委员会看管下的不直接遣返的战俘，经过有关一方的解释，请求遣返者也已遣返。如果还有未请求遣返的战俘，对于这些人的处理很显然是战后和平解决朝鲜问题的一部分，而不是停战的问题，因此，只能提交政治会议解决。政治会议在改变了的情况下，是完全能够合理解决这个问题的。你方说因为政治会议要处理有关和平解决朝鲜问题的许多问题，所以不能解决这一问题。其实正好相反，正是因为高一级政治会议要负责解决有关和平解决朝鲜问题的许多问题，因此也就完全能够解决这一问题。如果一个剩余战俘的问题还不能解决，还能期望它解决其他更重大的问题吗？
    我们认为问题需要逐步解决，在解决前一阶段的问题时，应该为下一阶段问题的解决铺平道路。这是符合世界人民的和平愿望的。而你方的想法却正好相反，你方在前一阶段中，就设想下一阶段的问题不能解决，从而使第一阶段的问题也不能解决，因此也就使所有问题不能解决，使朝鲜停战根本不能实现。这是完全违背世界人民逐步消除世界紧张局势的和平愿望的。我方坚决不能同意你方这种主张。
    关于你方昨天所提出的中立国遣返委员会各国费用的偿还问题，我方认为中立国遣返委员会各国在看管不直接遣返的战俘时所支出的一切费用，应由这些战俘的所属一方负担。
    三天以来，你方对我方五月七日提出的八点方案提出了一系列的问题要求澄清。不管你方所提出的问题是如何琐屑，我们都给予了郑重的考虑。按照你方所提问题的性质，凡具有一定程度的重要性目前需要具体答复者，我方都作了充分的答复。但对于纯粹细节性的问题，我方则认为只要双方对主要问题达成协议，是不难在合理和实际的基础上求得对双方都公平的解决的，因此目前没有作具体答复的必要。我方这种态度是完全合理的。你方认为这些细节问题不澄清，就不能对主要问题进行讨论，是不能取信于人的。试问有谁会相信如果双方同意了对不直接遣返的战俘进行解释的期限，还需要确定对每一批战俘进行解释的时间吗？有谁会相信不确定进行解释的人数，就不能确定将不直接遣返的战俘置于中立国遣返委员会的看管之下，让有关一方进行解释的主要问题吗？有谁会相信一旦双方同意了中立国遣返委员会成员国应配备有同等数目的武装力量，而却不能商定这些武装力量是军事警察，或是武装的民政人员吗？这显然是任何人都不能相信的。你方自己也不相信这样的事。
    当五月五日我方要求你方澄清在不直接遣返的战俘留在拘留一方时，如何能解除拘留一方的军事控制而同时又能维持战俘营秩序的这个主要问题时，五月六日你方说：‘在未确定中立国收容者之前讨论这个问题的细节，很显然是为时过早的’。虽然谁都能判断我方所提出的问题并非细节问题，而你方却称之为细节，声称在重要问题决定前予以讨论为时过早，但当我方试图迁就你方将不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜的主张，提出一个解决了各项主要问题的合理而又实际的全面方案时，你方却又提出一些谁都能判断是属于行政细节的问题，并且声称这些问题不加澄清，就不能解决主要问题。我们认为你方这种自相矛盾的立场是完全站不住的。
    为了实现举世渴望的朝鲜停战，我方自复会以来已经作了一系列的重大努力。但尽管如此，数日以来你方在会内不断提出琐屑问题消费时间。你方这种做法，很难使人相信你方是如你方自己所声称的愿意迅速获致朝鲜停战的。为了双方有子弟在朝鲜作战的人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的利益，我们建议双方代表团大会迅速通过我方五月七日方案，以便进入具体细节的安排。”
