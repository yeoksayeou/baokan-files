    CCP Central Committee Shandong Sub-bureau Makes Decision:
    Establish Key Counties to Strengthen Leadership in Rural Work

    Editor's Note: Here is published the "Decision on Establishing Key Counties" by the CCP Central Committee Shandong Sub-bureau, for reference by various regions. Determining and establishing key counties or districts is a very important leadership method. It can solve the problems of in-depth work, discovering problems, creating experience, implementing policies, and cultivating cadres. It should be universally adopted in various regions. To do a good job in key counties, the key lies in strengthening the allocation of cadres in the local county and district committees, rather than strengthening external work teams. Various regions should transfer a group of outstanding cadres with rural work experience and high leadership skills to serve as the county and district committees in key counties and districts, assign them certain tasks, and not transfer them within three to five years, so that they can work with peace of mind, take root, blossom, and bear fruit there, in order to achieve practical results. It is also necessary to send cadres from higher levels to form work teams to help establish key areas, but the experience they create often has the disadvantage of being divorced from the level of the masses, and it is easy to generate impatience for success, substitution, and other problems, thus forming the phenomenon of people in place, work in place, people gone, work collapse. This point should be paid special attention to.

    [Report from this newspaper] In order to overcome the bureaucracy of leading organs and the commandism and violations of law and discipline among grassroots cadres, to closely connect with the broad masses of the people, and to strengthen the leadership of rural work, the CCP Central Committee Shandong Sub-bureau made a "Decision on Establishing Key Counties" in February this year. The decision stated: In the leadership of rural work, we require our leadership organs and leading cadres at all levels to resolutely transform the long-standing generalized leadership style, earnestly go deep into the lower levels, go deep among the masses, strengthen specific guidance and inspection of work, so as to improve leadership skills, and correctly implement and implement the various instructions of the Central Committee and the East China Bureau in light of local actual conditions and mass demands. Leading organs and leading cadres should personally grasp the key points, create models, directly absorb the experience and lessons of work, and promptly concentrate the demands and creations of the masses, so as to guide and promote overall work with leadership and with positions. To this end, the sub-bureau specifically decided to take Junan County of Yishui District, Licheng County of Tai'an District, and Guangrao County of Huimin District as the key counties of the sub-bureau and the respective district committees, earnestly strengthen leadership, and earnestly achieve results. The basic tasks should be: all work should take a step forward, first absorb experience and lessons, promptly reflect the situation at the lower levels, and promote the general through typical demonstration. The specific tasks of a typical county are:

    First, all work should first be deployed and implemented in the key counties, taking a step forward to create experience, and promptly inspect the implementation of various work arrangements of the sub-bureau and the district committees, understand the demands and reflections of the people, and summarize the experience and lessons in the work.

    Second, create leadership experience and specific experience in various tasks for counties, districts, and townships to carry out comprehensive rural work centered on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation.

    Third, obtain typical experience in running a mutual aid team, an agricultural producers' cooperative, a grassroots supply and marketing cooperative, and a credit cooperative, as well as experience in promoting comprehensive agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement by combining points and areas.

    Fourth, study the working methods of implementing the mass line in leading rural work, the specific experience of overcoming commandism and transforming work style, and cultivate good examples, commend good people and good deeds, and establish advanced banners.

    In order to achieve the tasks and requirements of the key counties, the following measures must be taken:

    First of all, the sub-bureau and the district committees must strengthen specific guidance to the key counties to ensure that the work of the key counties does take a step forward. The key county party committee should also select one or two districts with a better foundation as key districts; and in each key district, select one or two townships with a better foundation as key townships. In terms of leadership, the county party committee should directly grasp typical mutual aid teams and typical agricultural production cooperatives to help run key townships well; at the same time, it should grasp key townships to help run key districts well, and guide and promote the work of the whole county; in order to obtain specific experience in running a team, a cooperative, a township, and a district well, as well as systematic leadership experience in promoting the whole by focusing on key points, combining points and areas, fully expanding, and running a county well. No experience may be spread randomly without approval; those promoted in the entire district or county must be carefully discussed and decided by the district party committee or the county party committee; those promoted within the area of a special district must be studied and decided by the district committee; those promoted within the entire province should have a formal decision of the sub-bureau, so as to affirm and promote the good and criticize and prevent the bad. The newspaper should send reporters to participate in the work of the key counties and systematically report on the work experience of the key counties.

    Secondly, replenish the leading backbone of the key counties. In addition to the sub-bureau sending a work team to the key county, each district committee should immediately extract a department head and several backbones, and form a unified work team with the cadres sent by the sub-bureau, determine the captain and deputy captain, and directly participate in the work of the key county, responsible to the sub-bureau and the district committee. After the work team arrives in the county, it will carry out work under the unified leadership of the county party committee; the district committee may determine a part of the cadres to participate in the county party committee or the district committee as members to strengthen the leadership of the county and district according to the needs of the work. All cadres shall be uniformly deployed and participate in the work of key districts and townships with local county and district cadres, and no department of the original agency shall be transferred without the approval of the sub-bureau and the district committee.

    Third, strengthen the connection with the key counties, and the sub-bureau and the district committees should often specifically discuss the work of the key counties, districts, and townships, summarize typical experiences, and instruct and deploy work. The relevant instructions from higher authorities forwarded by the sub-bureau, the provincial government, the military region, and various business departments, the district committees, the special commissioner's office, the military sub-district, and various business departments, and the relevant instructions and documents issued should also be sent to the key counties at the same time, and the county party committee should uniformly study and implement them according to the actual situation, and not directly deploy work to the work team. The various work reports and experience summaries of the key counties shall be submitted by the county party committee, the county government, and relevant business departments to the district committee, the sub-bureau, and relevant business departments, and the work team shall not submit separate reports. In addition to making a comprehensive report once a month and a situation report once every half month, the county party committee should mainly report various typical experiences, reflect the situation and problems in the work at the lower levels, and not be constrained by form, number of words, or time, but strive to be vivid, lively, quick, and timely, in the form of special reports or telegrams, letters, telephones, etc. Comprehensive reports and summaries of various experiences, as well as important information and materials, should be reported to the East China Bureau at the same time. In order to ensure timely contact, the relevant departments are responsible for quickly connecting the telephone between the sub-bureau, the district committee, and the key counties and districts, and immediately adjusting and strengthening traffic and postal delivery.

    After receiving this decision, Yishui District Committee, Tai'an District Committee, and Huimin District Committee should seriously discuss and study and make a specific plan for the work of the district committee on the key counties, and report it to the sub-bureau for approval and implementation. Each district committee should discuss and determine the key counties and districts according to the spirit of this decision and formulate a work plan to report to the sub-bureau. Each department and committee of the sub-bureau and the party group and party subgroup of the provincial government should abide by this decision and make a specific plan to participate in the work of the key counties in connection with their business work and report it to the sub-bureau.

    中共中央山东分局作出决定
    建立基点县加强农村工作的领导
    编者按：这里发表了中共中央山东分局“关于建立基点县的决定”，供各地参考。确定与建立基点或重点县、区，是一项很重要的领导方法，可以解决深入工作、发现问题、创造经验、贯彻政策和培养干部几方面的问题，各地应普遍采用。要作好基点县的工作，关键在于加强当地县、区委干部的配备，而不在于加强外来的工作队。各地应该调配一批有农村工作经验和较高领导水平的优秀干部去担任基点县、区的县委和区委，交付他们一定的任务，三、五年内不调动他们，让他们安心工作，在那里生根开花结实，以便收到实效。上级调派干部组成工作队帮助建立基点也有必要，但他们所创造出的经验常常带有脱离群众水平的缺点，而且容易产生急于求成、代替包办等毛病，从而形成人在工作在，人走工作垮的现象，这一点是应该特别注意的。
    【本报讯】中共中央山东分局为了克服领导机关的官僚主义和基层干部中的命令主义、违法乱纪现象，密切与广大人民群众的联系，加强农村工作的领导，在今年二月作了“关于建立基点县的决定”。决定中说：在农村工作的领导上，要求我们各级领导机关和领导干部坚决转变长期存在着的一般化的领导作风，切实深入下层，深入群众，加强工作的具体指导与检查，以提高领导水平，结合当地实际情况和群众要求，正确地执行与贯彻中央及华东局的各项指示。领导机关与领导干部应该亲自掌握基点，创造典型，直接吸取工作的经验和教训，及时集中群众的要求和创造，以有领导和有阵地地指导与推动全面工作。为此，分局特决定以沂水地委之莒南县，泰安地委之历城县，惠民地委之广饶县为分局及各该地委之基点县，认真加强领导，切实做出成绩。其基本任务应是：一切工作走前一步，首先吸取经验教训，及时反映下层情况，典型示范推动一般。典型县的具体任务是：
    第一、一切工作首先在基点县内布置贯彻，走前一步创造经验，并及时检查分局及地委的各项工作部署的贯彻情况，了解人民群众的要求和反映，总结工作中的经验教训。
    第二、创造县、区、乡以农业生产互助合作为中心开展农村全面工作的领导经验及各项工作的具体经验。
    第三、取得办好一个互助组、一个农业生产合作社、一个基层供销合作社和信贷合作社的典型经验，以及点面结合推动全面农业生产、互助合作运动的经验。
    第四、研究在领导乡村工作中贯彻群众路线的工作方法，克服命令主义，转变工作作风的具体经验，并培养好的典型，表扬好人好事，树立先进旗帜。
    为实现基点县的任务与要求，必须切实采取以下措施：
    首先，分局及地委必须加强对基点县的具体指导，务使基点县工作确实走前一步。基点县委亦应选择一、二个基础较好的区作为基点区；并在每一个基点区内选择一、二个基础较好的乡做为基点乡。县委在领导上应直接抓住典型互助组、典型农业生产合作社帮助搞好基点乡；同时应抓住基点乡帮助搞好基点区，指导与推动全县工作；以取得搞好一个组、一个社、一个乡、一个区的具体经验及以重点推动全面，点面结合，全面展开，搞好一个县的系统领导经验。一切经验非经批准不得乱传；凡在全区或全县推广者，须经过区委或县委认真讨论决定；凡在专区范围内推广者，须经过地委研究决定；须在全省范围内推广者，则应有分局之正式决定，以肯定与推广好的，批判与防止坏的。报社应派出记者参加基点县工作，并系统地报道基点县的工作经验。
    其次，充实基点县的领导骨干。除分局派出基点县工作队外，各该地委应即抽出一个部长及若干骨干，与分局派出的干部组成统一的工作队，确定正副队长，直接对分局、地委负责参加基点县工作。工作队到县后，即在县委统一领导下进行工作；地委可根据工作需要确定一部分干部参加县委或区委为委员以加强县区领导。所有干部均与当地县区干部统一调配参加基点区、乡工作，非经分局及地委批准，原机关部门一律不得调动。
    第三、密切与基点县的联系，分局及地委应经常具体讨论基点县、区、乡的工作，总结典型经验，指示与部署工作。分局、省府、军区及各业务部门，地委、专署、军分区及各业务部门转发的上级有关指示及下达的有关指示文件，均应同时发往基点县，由县委根据实际情况，统一研究，贯彻执行，不向工作队直接布置工作。基点县之各项工作报告及经验总结均由县委、县府及有关业务部门上报地委、分局及有关业务部门，工作队不另作报告。县委对地委及分局除每月做综合报告一次、半月做情况报告一次外，主要应随时以专题报告或电报、函件、电话等形式，报告各种典型经验、反映下层工作中的情况及问题，不拘形式，不限字数，不定时间，唯求生动、活泼、迅速及时综合报告及各项经验的总结，以及重要情况资料等均应同时报告华东局。为保证联系及时，责成有关部门迅速架通分局、地委与基点县区之间的电话，立即调整与加强交通邮递。
    沂水地委、泰安地委、惠民地委接到此决定后，应即认真讨论研究做出地委对基点县工作的具体计划，报告分局批准执行。各地委应根据此决定的精神，讨论确定基点县区并制订工作计划报告分局。分局各部委及省府党组、党分组应遵照此一决定联系业务工作做出参加基点县工作的具体计划报告分局。
