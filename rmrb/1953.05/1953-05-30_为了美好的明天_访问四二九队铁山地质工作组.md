    For a Better Tomorrow
    ——Visiting the Iron Mountain Geological Team of the 429 Team
    By Our Correspondent  Wang Qi
    Visiting Iron Mountain is a very pleasant experience. This is not only because Iron Mountain is a place surrounded by mountains and beautiful scenery, but more importantly, Iron Mountain is full of the joy of labor. In the first spring of the country's planned economic construction, these magnificent scenes will inspire everyone who comes to Iron Mountain, as if seeing a happy tomorrow.
    In April, the Iron Mountain Geological Team of the 429 Team completed their first geological exploration report. The iron ore reserves precisely calculated in this resource report will serve as an important basis for the construction of a new steel center in the motherland. This solemn and sacred cause inspires the young and happy people of the Iron Mountain Geological Team.
    The Iron Mountain Geological Team consists of nine people. It was very difficult to complete such a heavy task in April. Three of them are trainees who have never attended a geological school. When they first came to Iron Mountain at the end of last year, they were like children standing on the edge of the vast ocean. There are several large mountains between Old Iron Mountain and Jian Mountain. A mountain is just a mountain; you can't see anything. But the veteran comrades said, "We must calculate the iron reserves of each mountain." "How is this possible!" The three trainees embarked on this new position with such vague feelings. The other three interns were fresh graduates from university. They had studied and interned; but lacked practical work experience. The three technicians, affectionately called the older generation, had just come out of the classroom not long before liberation. The darkness of the old society prevented them from getting any warmth. To learn skills, they had to carry stones and follow the master aimlessly. One year, two years, they couldn't get their hands on a geological map. The master remained silent, and the apprentice dared not ask questions easily. They each had their own thoughts, and an invisible chasm separated them. After liberation, everything changed. The country cherished them, the people expected them, and the glorious task of exploring underground secrets fell on their shoulders. Although they had surging enthusiasm for work, they were also unfamiliar with the new geological work. They were not afraid of heavy burdens, treating it as the greatest glory; they were not afraid of difficulties, regarding it as a test. They did not assign tasks based on people, but distributed everyone's work based on needs. Each person undertook two or more tasks. They climbed mountains on sunny days and went into caves on rainy days. In the evening, their sweat-soaked clothes and damp shoes had not yet been taken off when they began preparing for the next day's work.
    Dong Xinjú, who grew up in the beautiful Tsinghua Garden, completed a four-year university course in three years for the needs of the motherland. Last September, she embarked on this glorious position. She was twenty-two years old and had never left her mother. She fought against homesickness and stomach ailments. When she came out, she said she would return home in three months, but now it has been half a year, and her mother is writing to inquire about her return date. She told her mother: "Look for my news in the People's Daily and the People's Pictorial, I might come home anytime." Her lover works in another geological exploration team, and they deeply miss each other. The organization wanted to take care of them and let them work together. She thought: "This is when the interests of the country and personal interests conflict, and I should make a choice. This is a test!" She replied to the organization twice that she was unwilling to go. She said, "I am like a small screw on a large machine. If I leave, the machine will not work properly, so I should stay." Intern Wang Guangtian made observation points in a tunnel more than a thousand meters long. In the past, in order to plunder our resources and enrich themselves, the Japanese imperialists hurriedly took away our iron, leaving us with a very irregular and dilapidated tunnel. The people of the Iron Mountain Geological Team described this tunnel as: "One step high, one step low, slippery and dangerous!" Although she suffered from arthritis, she still squatted in that constantly dripping tunnel all day long. In the cave that no one had entered for many years, there was an indescribable stuffy smell. The dim light of the kerosene lamp always clashed with her nearsighted eyes. After working in the tunnel for a day, her complexion turned yellow. If someone advised her to take a rest, she always refused and continued to work as usual. Work such as coordinating drilling rigs, measuring water levels, and splitting rock cores was not done by technicians and interns, but by trainees independently. They were few in number, had a lot of work, and were far apart. They came up with ways to save every minute and every second. When measuring water levels and coordinating drilling rigs, the trainees planned the route they would take for the day in advance, trying to shorten walking time, avoid detours, and increase working time. When measuring water levels, they arranged the numbers of the water level benchmark in advance, and put the pencil on the page to be recorded. When measuring and recording, they put the tape measure and the notebook together to avoid wasting time looking for this and that. They measured and recorded while following the prescribed route. Their efforts resulted in higher work efficiency, completing fifty-two points in one day. When I visited them, trainee Li Boyang proudly told me: "Now, we are not simply learning, we are already directly participating in the work. Each of us can complete the work plan for each quarter, month, and day."
    The nine people work as one. They study and discuss every job they do. Sometimes, they ask comrades from other departments to give them lectures on surveying, physical prospecting, and drilling. In order to better understand their work, they often study the work of departments related to their own. Sometimes, nine people surround a rectangular table piled with maps and books, shoulder to shoulder and head to head, studying and thinking. After technician Shen Qihan announced the topic to be discussed, a lively scene immediately appeared. Some expressed opinions, some asked questions, and some expressed opinions that were sharply opposed to those of other comrades. No one was an exception to participating in this debate, and even the normally most silent Huang Zhong's voice was no smaller than others. Once, I participated in their discussion on how to learn advanced Soviet methods of calculating ore reserves. Bian Xiaozeng and Huang Zhong had a dispute, and everyone else participated in the discussion. Finally, under the unified idea of ​​accurately calculating ore reserves, they reached a consensus. The recording comrade recorded this conclusion in the notebook, and the work was carried out based on this conclusion. The same debate also occurred in other occasions. The three interns and the three trainees all worked independently. Within a certain period, the technician would check the work of the interns. Bian Xiaozeng firmly believed in one principle: "Geological work relies on running with two legs. If you don't go there, there will be problems." When he was making the geological map of Coffin Board Mountain, because he didn't go to one place, he misunderstood the entire geological structure. When he took interns up the mountain, he always liked to talk a lot. He said: "In the past, when doing geological work, you would just stand on the top of the mountain, make a big stroke with a pen, and that was it. Now, we must withstand inspection after inspection, and there must be no difference even in the slightest detail." He used this spirit to check the work of the interns. "Old Wang! The position of this observation point is wrong." If the other party slightly emphasized objective reasons, he immediately strictly said: "If the measurement is wrong, we can measure it ourselves with a tape measure!" He never hesitated to have the work that should be reworked reworked. Dong Xinju, the youngest in the group, often received help from her older brothers and sisters. When she first came, she went out with the veteran comrades to fill in the geological map, and the veteran comrades always pointed out the geological changes to her as they walked. The veteran comrades drew the map and then asked her to look at it. When she started working, she couldn't distinguish faults, but later she slowly learned. Now she also teaches the trainees how to work like the veteran comrades. Seeing them being sent to work by the motherland as priceless treasures, and seeing their leaping progress, the veteran comrades often said enviously: "You are so lucky!" Dong Xinju always replied: "People in the future will be even happier than us!"
    They love their work. They understand Iron Mountain as well as they understand their best friend. They love Iron Mountain as they love their own mother. After working indoors for a while, they thought about going to the mountain to see how Iron Mountain was doing. People returning from the field excitedly told other comrades about their day's work. The other comrades listened with great pleasure, asking about everything they were familiar with and cared about: a mountain range, a fault, a rock. The cheerful Dong Xinju immediately jumped up and said, "How is my Jianlin Mountain?" as soon as she heard someone mention it.
    "I've been to that place, what a good iron ore!"
    They love Iron Mountain, and Iron Mountain also loves them, constantly revealing new knowledge and treasures to them. The reserves of Iron Mountain were accurately calculated, and new ore was found in Jianlin Mountain. Every small victory made them love their work even more; every step forward became the reason for their joy. In the evening, Iron Mountain is very beautiful and moving, and everything is shrouded in a thin mist. The spring breeze blows, bringing the fragrance of rapeseed flowers from the fields. People who have worked all day long are laughing loudly on the sports field, in the club, and in the fields. The comrades of the Iron Mountain Geological Team, recently, have often been the last to leave the office and the last to return from the mountain, but they quickly blend in with this warm night. Watching movies, dancing, walking, even if it's only for a few minutes after they finish their work, they participate with great enthusiasm. Rather than saying they are drawing a map, writing a report, or climbing a mountain, it is better to say that they are approaching the most lofty ideal day by day, and every moment of work brings so much joy and happiness. In the past, the ideals of geological workers were always ideals, and a dotted line was still a dotted line many years later. A large mountain buried with endless treasures, just because it is covered by a thin layer of yellow soil that cannot be seen through with the naked eye, will prevent you from seeing the true face of the rock layer changes. In the old society, many geological workers also had enthusiasm and ideals, but their ideals were lost on paper. An old geological worker, who had struggled for half his life, came to a conclusion, and he wrote in a geology book: Geology is an unscientific science. When Dong Xinju, who was born in the new society, was studying at university, she couldn't understand this sentence no matter what. She thought:
    "Since it is science, why is it unscientific?" After she came to Iron Mountain to work, she slowly understood. It's not that geology is unscientific, but that there were no conditions in the past to prove the inferences of geology. Knowing it was the same as not knowing it, which was the tragedy of geological workers in the old society. What about now? There are various scientific and advanced methods and large-scale new-style tools, and every correct inference obtained through hard work will be immediately confirmed. Sometimes, even if the guess is wrong, the facts will educate them in turn. They are constantly being tested in this way, and constantly being encouraged by new victories. They are the beloved children of the motherland, and the people of the whole country are cheering for their every new gain. They are like tender buds growing in fertile soil, growing up day by day. They love the motherland, and the sparks of their struggle to explore treasures illuminate the bright future of the motherland.

    为了美好的明天
    ——访问四二九队铁山地质工作组
    本报记者  汪琦
    访问铁山是十分愉快的事。这不但因为铁山是一个群山环抱、风景优美的地方，更重要的是铁山到处充满着劳动的喜悦。在祖国有计划的经济建设开始的第一年春天，这些壮丽的景象，使每一个来到铁山的人都会振奋起来，如同看见了幸福的明天一样。
    四月，四二九队铁山地质工作组已完成了他们第一个地质勘探报告。这个资源报告所精确计算出来的铁矿埋藏量，将作为祖国建设新的钢铁中心的重要的依据。这个庄严的神圣的事业，鼓舞着铁山地质工作组的年青、快乐的人们。
    铁山地质工作组一共有九个人，要在四月份完成这样繁重的任务，是十分困难的。他们之中有三个人是从来没有进过地质学校的练习生。他们去年年底刚来铁山的时候，就像站在汪洋大海边上的孩子。从老铁山到尖山，中间有几座大山。山就是山，什么也看不出来。老同志却说：“要把每座山的铁埋藏量计算出来。”“这怎么可能呢！”三个练习生就是带着这样渺茫的心情走上了这个新的岗位上来的。另外三个实习员是刚从大学毕业出来的。他们学习过，也实习过；但没有实际工作的经验。被他们所亲爱地称呼为老一辈的三个技术员，解放前不久才从课堂走出来。旧社会的阴暗，使他们没有得到一点温暖。要学本领，就要背着石头，跟在师傅后面茫无目的地走。一年，两年，都摸不着地质图。师傅默默无言，徒弟也不敢轻意询问。他们各有各的心思，一条看不见的鸿沟把他们隔开了。解放后的一切情况都变了，国家爱护着他们，人民期待着他们，发掘地下秘密的光荣任务落在他们的肩上。他们虽然有着奔放的工作热情，但是，对新的地质工作也很生疏。他们不怕担子重，把这当作最大的光荣；他们不怕困难，把它看成考验。他们不是根据人规定任务，而是根据需要来分配每个人的工作。每个人都担负着两种以上的工作。他们晴天爬山，下雨进洞。晚上，他们汗水湿透的衣服和潮湿的鞋还没有脱下来，就又开始准备第二天的工作了。
    生长在美丽的清华园的董新菊，为着祖国的需要，三年读完了四年的大学课程。去年九月，她走上了这个光荣的岗位。她出生二十二年，从来没有离开过妈妈。她和思家病、胃病斗争着。她出来的时候说三个月后回家，现在已经半年了，妈妈来信探询着她的归期。她告诉妈妈：“你在人民日报和人民画报上看我的消息吧，我说不定什么时候回家。”她的爱人在另外一个地质勘探队里工作，他们彼此深深地怀念着。组织上为了照顾他们，让他们到一起去工作。她想：“这是祖国利益和个人利益矛盾的时候，我应有所选择。这是一个考验！”她两次答复组织，她不愿意走。她说：“我就好比一部大机器上的一个小螺丝钉，我走了，机器就会不灵的，我还是留下吧。”实习员王光天在一个一千多公尺长的坑道里做观测点。过去，日本帝国主义为了掠夺我们的资源，养肥他们自己，匆匆忙忙地抢走了我们的铁，把一个非常不规则而又残破的坑道留给我们。铁山地质工作组的人形容这个坑道说：“一脚高一脚低，又滑又危险！”她虽然患着关节炎，还是整天蹲在那上面不断滴水的坑道里工作。许多年没有人进过的坑洞里，有一股说不出的闷人的气味。煤油灯昏暗的灯光，总是和她的近视眼闹蹩扭，在坑道里工作了一天，出来时，她的脸色都变黄了。如果有人劝她休息一下，她总是拒绝，接着照常去工作。配合钻机、测水位、劈取岩心等工作，技术员和实习员都没有参加，由练习生独立去做。他们人少，工作多，路途相隔很远。他们想出了节省一分钟、一秒钟的窍门。练习生在测水位和配合钻机的时候，把一天所要走的路线先计划好，尽量缩短走路时间，不走弯路，增加工作时间。量水位时先把水位基号的号码排列好，把铅笔放在要记录的那页纸上，在测记时，把皮尺和记录本放在一起，不会因找这找那而耽误时间。他们一边测，一边记，顺着规定的路线走。他们的心血换得了更高的工作效率，一天做了五十二个点子。当我访问他们的时候，练习生李伯阳自豪地告诉我：“现在，我们不单纯学习，我们已经直接参加工作了。我们每个人都能完成每季、每月、每天的工作计划。”
    九个人就像一个人在工作。他们做每一件工作，都要经过学习和讨论。有时，他们请别的部门的同志给他们讲测量、物理探矿、钻探。为了更懂得自己的工作，他们经常学习和自己工作有关的部门的工作。有时，九个人围着一个堆满了图和书本的长方桌子，肩碰着肩、头挨着头地研究和思考。技术员沈其韩把要讨论的题目宣布以后，热闹场面马上就出现了。有的发表意见，有的提问题，有的说出自己和其他同志尖锐对立的意见。参加这种争论，是没有一个人例外的，平时最沉默的黄钟的声音也决不小于别人。有一次，我参加他们关于怎样学习苏联计算矿量的先进方法的讨论会。边效曾和黄钟之间发生了争论，大家也都参加了讨论。最后，在精确计算矿量的统一的思想下，意见一致了。记录的同志把这个结论记在本子上，工作就是依据着这个结论来进行的。同样的争论，也会发生在另外的场合。三个实习员和三个练习生都是独立工作的。在一定的时期内，技术员要检查实习员的工作。边效曾很相信一个道理：“做地质工作靠两条腿跑，那里没有跑到，就会出毛病。”他做棺材板山地质图时，因为有一个地方没有走到，把整个地质构造搞错了。他带着实习员上山的时候，总喜欢谈许多话。他说：“过去做地质工作，站在山头一看，大笔一勾，就算完了。现在，我们要经得起一次又一次的检查，一丝一毫也差不得。”他就是用这种精神来检查实习员的工作的。“老王！这个观测点位置错了。”对方稍一强调客观原因，他马上就严格地说：“测量的不对，我们自己可以用皮尺量呀！”他是从来不吝惜让该返工的工作返工的。全组年纪最小的董新菊常常得到大哥和大姐的帮助。她刚来时，跟老同志出去填地质图，老同志总是一边走一边指给她看地质变化现象。老同志画了图，又叫她看。她开始工作的时候分不清断层，以后就慢慢地学会了。现在她也和老同志一样教练习生怎样工作。老同志看到他们被祖国当作无价之宝送到工作中来，又看到他们飞跃进步的情况，常常羡慕地说：“你们真幸福！”董新菊总是这样回答：“以后的人比我们更幸福！”
    他们热爱工作。他们了解铁山，就像了解一个最好的朋友一样。他们爱铁山，就像爱自己的母亲一样。在室内工作了一个时候，就想到山上去看看铁山怎么样了。从野外回来的人，兴奋地把一天的工作告诉别的同志。别的同志带着极大的愉快听着，问到他们所熟悉的和关怀的一切：一条山脉，一个断层，一块石头。快乐的董新菊一听到人提到尖林山，马上就跳起来说：“我的尖林山怎样了？”
    “那个地方我去过，多好的铁矿呵！”
    他们爱铁山，铁山也爱他们，不断地把新的知识和宝藏显露给他们。铁山的埋藏量被正确地计算出来了，尖林山又见了新矿。每一个小的胜利，都使他们更热爱工作；每一步的前进，都成为他们欢乐的原因。傍晚，铁山是十分美丽动人的，一切都笼罩在薄薄的迷雾中。春风吹过，带来田野中一阵阵的油菜花香。劳动了一天的人们，在球场上、在俱乐部里、在田野中，纵声地欢笑着。铁山地质工作组的同志，最近以来，往往是从办公室出来的最迟，从山上回来的最晚，但是，他们很快就和这温暖的夜晚融和在一起了。看电影、跳舞、散步，在他们做完了工作之后，那怕只有几分钟，他们也是抱着极大的热情参加的。与其说他们在画一张图，写一段报告，爬一座山，不如说他们是在一天天地接近着最崇高的理想，每一刻的工作都带来那样多的愉快和幸福。从前地质工作者的理想永远是理想，一条虚线多少年以后还是一条虚线。一座埋藏了无穷宝藏的大山，仅仅因为一层薄薄的肉眼看不透的黄土掩盖着，就会使你看不见岩层变化的真面目。旧社会里许多地质工作者也有过热情和理想，可是，他们的理想在纸上湮没了。一个老地质工作者，他奋斗了半生，得出了一个结论，他曾在一本地质书上写着：地质学是一种不科学的科学。在新社会里诞生的董新菊在大学念书时，读到这一句话，她无论如何弄不懂。她想：
    “既然是科学，为什么又不科学呢？”在她到铁山来工作以后，她慢慢地懂得了。不是地质学不科学，而是过去没有任何条件能够证实地质学上的推断，知道了也等于不知道，这正是旧社会地质工作者的悲哀。现在呢？有各种科学的先进办法和大规模的新式的工具，每一个勤劳得来的正确推论，立刻就会得到证实。有时，虽然推想错了，事实又会反过来教育他们。他们就是这样不断被考验着，不断被新的胜利所鼓舞。他们是祖国宠爱的儿女，全国人民为着他们每一个新的收获欢呼着。他们就像生长在肥沃的土地上的嫩芽，一天天地成长起来了。他们热爱祖国，他们的勘探宝藏的斗争火花，照亮了祖国灿烂的远景。
