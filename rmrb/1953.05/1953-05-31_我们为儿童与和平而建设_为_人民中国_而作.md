    We Build for Children and Peace
    —Written for "People's China"
    Song Qingling

    Ultimately, the result of all work and effort should be to improve the health and welfare of children. This is a law applicable to every place and every person's life. Since time immemorial, this has been one of the driving forces propelling the world forward: to give children a higher standard of living, to allow them to enjoy more of life's happiness than their parents, and to enable them to grow and become independent, creating a world that meets their needs.

    China is, of course, no exception to this law. Fulfilling our duties to children is one of our deeply ingrained traditions. But in the past, it was difficult, if not impossible, for most Chinese people to live by this law. It was fundamentally impossible to open a path for the lives of young people or to improve their lives; at best, they could only maintain their existence. And even that was often not possible. I think the suffering of Chinese children in the past due to war, oppressive government, and the resulting floods, famines, and epidemics is known throughout the world. It is an indelible part of our memory.

    Therefore, the Chinese people say with great joy: "Those days are gone forever." Today, the government of China is firmly in the hands of the people, who are consciously engaged in preventing war and governing for their own benefit. They are hundreds of millions of capable hands guided by clear and vigorous minds, who know how to build and how to protect the wealth earned from our abundant resources. They want to leave the fruits of their construction to their children. They are defending not only the beautiful meaning of their own lives but also the future of their children.

    China, which is carrying out its first Five-Year Plan, is a country pulsating with peaceful construction from border to border. Not a day goes by without production records being broken, and almost every week or every month, vast new areas are developed to serve humanity, and new factories, mines, water conservancy, or transportation projects are completed. The sounds and sights of construction reach your ears and eyes everywhere, and every project marks an improvement in the lives of the builders.

    An inseparable part of this is the unprecedented importance attached to the welfare of mothers and children. In our country, fulfilling our duties to children and to those who bring them into the world and initially nurture them is part of our fundamental law. We can say that the Chinese people have never fulfilled their responsibilities as well as they do today. Never before have there been so many maternal and child health institutions in our country, implementing the most modern and scientific methods. We have never given education to so many children as we do today, and this education is rooted in the best of our national and world cultures; it is based on love for our own people, love for humanity, love for work, and a desire, with a like-minded collective spirit, to accomplish great things for the people. Our entire country has never been in such a good state, especially for children, as it is today. This inspires our optimism and boundless confidence, which permeates every atom around us.

    However, we do not allow ourselves to forget the suffering that exists in other parts of the world while we are happy. We know that at this very moment, many parents are suffering cruel blows, watching their children live in hardship, enduring torment, and enjoying none of the happiness of childhood or youth. We cannot help but be deeply moved by this, because not long ago, we ourselves suffered these things. We cannot but share the tears of our sisters in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other Asian countries, Africa, and the Middle East. We cannot help but see that the "arms first" policy has closed the doors of orphanages in Britain, reduced the learning time of British teenagers, left two million Italian and four million American school-aged children wandering the streets, and forced millions of children and teenagers in Spain, Bolivia, the United States, and other places to work or be thrown into arduous labor such as mining; it has also forced the Japanese people to sell their children; it causes fifty percent of newborn infants in Turkey to die.

    We, the Chinese people, are very indignant when we learn of these things and that such things can continue to happen in the twentieth century. We resolutely protest against these sufferings continuing, resolutely protest against the crime of destroying the physical and intellectual growth of millions of children, and resolutely protest against the murder of the remaining millions of children. We believe that these things threaten all children and the achievements of our people and the people of other countries. In any case, we must condemn these evils because they hinder the progress of the world.

    Unless there is peace, what else can correct these wrongs? Unless there is peace, what else can the Chinese and world people do to realize their cherished plans for children's welfare? For this issue, which is so closely linked to all the major problems in the world today, peace is the only solution; only with peace can the people of the world choose their own path to prosperity and then build the world to move it forward. Therefore, peace is the hope and demand of every ordinary person in every land. The Chinese people have been, are, and will be marching in these ranks. We will do our best to prevent the expansion of war, stop all existing wars, and thwart any attempts to launch new wars. Recent current events have once again clearly illustrated the position taken by the Chinese people.

    China will continue to move forward, working together with those who are moving forward on the same path, and cooperating in a friendly manner with all who are willing to be friends, to build her new life. China must continue to make her children healthy and happy. They will lack nothing that is necessary for a full and joyful life. China will continue to fight for peace and will never retreat. It is in this way that we are fulfilling our duty to the children of the world—the children are the treasures of this world today and the masters of tomorrow.

    我们为儿童与和平而建设
    ——为“人民中国”而作
    宋庆龄
    一切工作和努力的结果，归根结底，应该使儿童的健康和福利得到改善，这是适用于每一个地方每一个人的生活的一条规律。从无法记忆的时代起，这就已经成为推动世界前进的原动力之一，那就是要给儿童以更高的生活水平，让他们得到比他们双亲所得到的更多生命的欢乐，使他们有条件能够成长和独立起来，创造一个适合他们的要求的世界。
    对于这条规律，中国当然不能例外。对儿童要恪尽我们的天职是我们的根深蒂固的传统之一。但在往日，大多数中国人民要依照这一条规律来生活，即使不是不可能，也是很困难的。给年轻人的生命开辟一条道路或者提高他们的生活是根本不可能的，他们充其量是只能维持他们的生命。甚至连这点也做不到的情况还不少呢。我想，过去中国儿童由于战争、苛政以及从而产生的水灾、饥荒和疫病而遭受的苦难是全世界所熟悉的。在我们的记忆中这是不可磨灭的一部分。
    因此，中国人民怀着极大的欢乐来说：“那些日子是一去不复返了。”今天，中国的政府是牢固地掌握在人民手中，他们是在有意识地从事于防止战争的工作，他们为自己的利益而进行统治。他们是有着清醒而又奋发的头脑所指挥的几万万双能干的手，他们懂得怎样建设，也懂得怎样来保护那些从我们丰饶的资源中劳动得来的财富。他们建设的成果，他们决定要留给他们的儿童。他们所保卫的不仅是他们自己的生命的美好意义，而且是他们的儿童的将来。
    中国，正进行着第一个五年计划的中国，是一个从边疆到边疆到处跃动着和平建设的国家。没有一天不发生生产纪录被超过的事情，几几乎每一个星期或每一个月都有辽阔的新区被开发以服务人类，都有新的厂矿、水利或交通等工程宣告完工。建设的声音和景象，处处传入你的耳目，而每一个工程都标志着建设者的生活的改善。
    在这当中，一个密切不可分的部分是母亲和孩子们的福利受到了史无先例的重视。在我们的国度里，对于儿童和把儿童生到世界上来又最初抚育他们的人恪尽我们的天职，是我们的基本大法的一部分。我们可以说：中国人民从来没有像今天这样好地尽到了他们的职责。在我们的国度里，从来没有今天这样多的、推行着最现代化、最科学的方法的妇婴机构。我们从来没有给像今天这样多的儿童以教育，而且这种教育生根在我们民族的、和世界的最好的文化的土壤里；这种教育是以爱自己的人民、爱人类为基础的；是以爱工作，以志同道合的集体精神，为人民完成大事业的热望为基础的。我国全国从来没有过今天这样的好光景，特别是儿童的光景，现在是这样的光明。这激发起我们的乐观主义和无比的信心，它们弥漫在我们周围每一粒原子里。
    然而，我们不允许我们在快乐时，忘怀世界其他地方所存在的痛苦。我们知道，此时此刻就有许多父母受到残酷的打击，眼看着他们的孩子们过着困苦的生活，受尽折磨，一点享受不到童年或青春的幸福。我们不能不为此而深深地感动，因为，不久之前，我们也是身受过这些的。我们不能不分尝到我们的朝鲜、越南、马来亚的姐妹们，以及其他亚洲国家，非洲、中东的姐妹们的泪水。我们不能不看到“武装第一”的政策使英国的慈幼院关了门，使英国少年们的学习时间遭到了削减；使两百万意大利的、四百万美国的学龄儿童流浪街头；在西班牙、玻利维亚、美国和其他地方，它使成百万儿童和十几岁的少年被迫做工，或被投入采矿那样的繁重的劳动中去；它并使日本人民不得不出卖自己的儿女；它使百分之五十的土耳其的新生婴儿死去。
    我们中国人民知道这些以后，感到非常愤慨，二十世纪竟能容许这样的事情继续发生。我们坚决抗议这些苦难再继续下去，坚决抗议这摧毁数百万儿童的体力智力成长的罪行，坚决抗议其余的数百万儿童的遭受杀害。我们认为这些事威胁了全体儿童，威胁了我国和别国人民的成就。在任何情况下，我们都要谴责这些罪恶，因为它阻挠了世界的进展。
    除非有和平，还有什么别的能纠正这些错误？除非有和平，中国和世界人民还有什么别的能实现他们心愿中的儿童福利计划？对于这样紧密地联系着今天世界上一切主要问题的这个问题，和平是唯一的解决办法；只有有了和平，全世界人民才能选择自己的走向繁荣的道路，然后才能建设世界使它向前迈进。因此，和平是每一块土地上每一个老百姓的希望和要求。过去、现在和将来，中国人民都是在这些行列中行进的。我们要尽力阻止战争的扩大，制止所有现行战争和粉碎任何发动新战争的企图。最近的时事是又一次明确地阐明了这是中国人民所采取的立场。
    中国将和同一条路上前进的人同心协力，和一切愿做朋友的人友好合作，继续向前迈进，建设她的新的生活。中国一定要继续使她的儿童健康、快乐。凡是饱满的愉快的生命所必需的他们都不缺少。中国将继续为和平斗争，绝不退后。我们正是这样为全世界儿童恪尽我们的天职——儿童是这个世界今天的宝贝，明天的主人。    （新华社）
