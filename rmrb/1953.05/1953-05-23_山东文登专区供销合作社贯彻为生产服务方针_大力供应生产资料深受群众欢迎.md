Since the Spring Festival, the focus of the work of the Wendeng Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shandong has shifted from supplying consumer goods to supplying means of production. According to statistics from January to March, the cooperative has prepared 24,675,954 jin of various oil cakes, 14,768,719 jin of chemical fertilizers, 961 various waterwheels, 3,606 various walking plows, 304 sets of insecticide equipment, and 42,828 jin of pesticides. Among these, 60.09% of the oil cakes have been sold, an increase of 65.6% compared to the same period last year; 36.45% of the chemical fertilizers have been sold, an increase of 173.5% compared to the same period last year; 13.01% of the waterwheels have been sold, a decrease of 75.15% compared to the total sales from January, February, March, and April of last year; 49.97% of the walking plows have been sold, an increase of 254% compared to the total sales from January, February, March, and April of last year; 21.38% of the insecticide equipment has been sold, the same as the same period last year; and 16.61% of the pesticides have been sold. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, 2,581 heads of livestock have been purchased and supplied to the masses.

The reason for achieving the above results is that the cooperative, in the struggle against bureaucracy, has implemented the policy of "opposing, preventing, and building simultaneously," and its work style has undergone a significant transformation. When the Special District Cooperative deployed the supply work of means of production for this spring at the February County Cooperative Directors' Meeting, it reviewed and criticized the biases and errors that occurred last year, and adopted the following two specific measures: (1) The supply plan of means of production was distributed to the counties, but not specifically announced to the grassroots cooperatives, so as to avoid compulsory assignment in order to complete the planned figures; (2) Walking plows, row plows, waterwheels, and insecticide equipment were operated by the county cooperatives through establishing stations, instead of being specifically operated by the grassroots cooperatives, so as to prevent the grassroots cooperative cadres from using unscrupulous means to "massively sell" in order to overcome the large backlog of funds. In terms of operating style, it also advocated learning technology, bringing technology to the countryside; bringing walking plows to the fields; setting up waterwheels at the wells; and guaranteeing teaching, guaranteeing learning, and guaranteeing use; and encouraging the masses to buy voluntarily. It opposed only selling without technical guidance; opposed waiting for customers to come to the door; opposed leaving the products unattended after they were sold; and opposed forced assignments and coercive orders. Therefore, the grassroots cooperatives' operating styles of "waiting for business" and "only supplying without technical guidance" have changed, and the phenomenon of compulsory assignment has also been eliminated. In addition, the provincial and special district administrations trained 110 technical cadres for the grassroots cooperatives, providing concrete technical assistance to the peasants, so that the supplied materials could play their due role.

Several experiences:

First, the supply work of means of production, especially the promotion of new agricultural implements and chemical fertilizers, must be closely integrated with the central work, taking patriotic increase in production as a prerequisite, extensively and deeply carrying out propaganda and education, and fully mobilizing the masses.

(1) Use the method of comparing examples for propaganda and education. For example, the farmers in Xiashi Village, Third District, Haiyang, did not have the habit of using chemical fertilizers to feed wheat in the past. Many people had damaged their crops due to improper use, which increased the difficulty of promoting chemical fertilizers this year. Based on this situation, the cooperative convened a forum for wheat-producing households and low-yield households last year, where they exchanged experiences and lessons, and the masses were very satisfied. Four or five days after the meeting, the masses in the village bought 4,900 jin of chemical fertilizers. The cadres said: "This method is really effective. Last spring, we assigned tasks three times, and sold less than 2,500 jin. This time, we held a forum, and the sales volume in a few days exceeded last year's by one time." Zhou Wenqing and Chen Xisheng, farmers in Gouchunjia Village, Rongcheng, bought fertilizer powder together last spring. Zhou Wenqing applied 14 jin per mu of wheat, and Chen Xisheng was afraid of drought and did not use it. As a result, on the same land, Zhou Wenqing's wheat yielded 3 sheng (each sheng is 28 jin) more per mu than Chen Xisheng's. After having such a lesson, Chen Xisheng bought chemical fertilizer to feed the wheat early this spring. Based on this example, the cooperative drew a cartoon and expanded publicity during the market day. The masses in Chenjia Village saw the cartoon and talked about it: "It's not fake at all, it's a true story in our village." This kind of vivid people and events, the publicity of contrasting examples, played a great effect.

(2) Give play to the organizational role of supply and marketing cooperatives. In order to do a good job in the supply of means of production, the cooperative or retail store was used as a unit to convene a meeting of cooperative member representatives, inviting local party and government leaders to make mobilization reports, conduct patriotic and abundant production education, and the cooperative, with a spirit of self-criticism, reviewed the one-sided task viewpoint and coercive command style in the supply of means of production last year, and expressed its determination and method to the representatives to correct it. At the meeting, it is possible to introduce typical examples, exchange experiences, or cooperate with specific explanations and field tests, so that the representatives truly know the benefits of new agricultural implements and chemical fertilizers, so that they can specifically convey them to the cooperative members. Gejia United Village Cooperative in Kunyu County held a meeting of cooperative member representatives, and the result was very good.

Second, in order to do a good job in the supply of means of production, the cooperative insisted on the promotion route based on mutual aid and cooperation organizations and with labor models as the backbone. Beibuliu Village, belonging to Tengjia United Village Cooperative, sold 12,000 jin of chemical fertilizers this spring, of which 9,000 jin were sold through signing combined contracts with mutual aid groups. Kunyu Gejia United Village Cooperative signed combined contracts with 34 mutual aid groups (including one production cooperative), ordering 18 walking plows and 8,000 jin of chemical fertilizers. This kind of promotion route, on the one hand, meets the requirements of organized farmers to improve production and ensures better realization of patriotic and abundant production plans; on the other hand, it drives individual farmers to adopt new agricultural implements and chemical fertilizers through organized farmers. Bi Guangjie Mutual Aid Group in Longshanhou Village, belonging to Chishan United Village Cooperative in Rongcheng County, bought 2,200 jin of chemical fertilizers and top-dressed 149 mu of wheat. 90% of the farmers in the township saw that it was very effective and also top-dressed chemical fertilizers in the wheat fields.

Third, the supply of means of production, especially new agricultural implements and chemical fertilizers, must be combined with strengthening technical guidance. This spring, Wendeng Special District Cooperative emphasized that cooperative cadres should learn technology and be both business personnel and technicians; mobilize cooperative technicians to go to the fields, go deep into the masses to carry out technical guidance, and guarantee teaching, guaranteeing learning, and guaranteeing use. Some grassroots cooperative cadres personally installed agricultural implements for farmers and taught them how to use them, and the farmers immediately realized the benefits of new agricultural implements. Some places have adopted methods such as testing on market days, organizing the masses to visit, and conducting lectures and experiments and field exercises at mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings or mutual aid group leader meetings, which have also achieved good results. Yu Lichen, a technician from Shankou Village, belonging to Weihai Changfeng United Village Cooperative, heard that a farmer in the village carried a walking plow he bought last year to the field but could not use it, and was angry and swearing, preparing to use the old plow to cultivate the land. He immediately went to repair it for him and taught him how to use it. The farmer said with emotion: "Without technology, it's really impossible to do anything, I almost threw away a good thing." Kunyu Gejia United Village Cooperative demonstrated walking plows at the representative meeting, and the people who attended the meeting scrambled to hold the plows for trial. After the technology was mastered by the masses, they bought walking plows without any worries, and sold seven on the spot.

Fourth, we must implement the spirit of opposing bureaucracy and commandism into the supply of means of production. Improving the work style is the key to doing a good job in the cooperative. Since the beginning of spring, the development of the movement against bureaucracy and commandism has, on the one hand, stopped the phenomenon of using administrative means to assign tasks to the masses, and on the other hand, it has also created a phenomenon that some cadres are afraid of making the mistake of forced orders again and are hesitant to act. Some cadres do not know what method to use to replace the style of forced assignment and are very distressed. Based on this situation, Wendeng Special District Cooperative adopted the method of summarizing and introducing good experiences in a timely manner, and commending good units and individuals, which has played a great role. Now this method has become an important method to promote cadres to change their work style.

    山东文登专区供销合作社贯彻为生产服务方针
    大力供应生产资料深受群众欢迎
    春节以来，山东文登专区供销合作社的工作重点即由供应生活资料转向供应生产资料方面。据一至三月份的统计，合作社共备妥各种油饼二四、六七五、九五四斤，化学肥料一四、七六八、七一九斤，各式水车九六一部，各种步犁三、六○六部，药械三○四具，农药四二、八二八斤。其中油饼已销出百分之六十点零九，较去年同季增加百分之六五点六；化学肥料已销出百分之三六点四五，较去年同季增加百分之一七三点五；水车销出百分之十三点零一，与去年一、二、三、四月份相较，销量减少了百分之七五点一五；步犁已销出百分之四九点九七，与去年一、二、三、四月份相较，增加了百分之二五四；药械销出百分之二十一点三八，与去年同季相等；农药销出百分之一六点六一。此外，据不完整的统计，已购进并供应到群众手中的牲口为二、五八一头。
    获得以上成绩的原因是合作社在反对官僚主义的斗争中，贯彻了“边反、边防、边建”的方针，工作作风有了显著的转变。专区社在二月县社主任会议上布置今年春季的生产资料供应工作时，曾检查批判了去年所发生的偏向与错误，并采取了下列两项具体措施：（1）生产资料供应计划分配到县，而不具体向基层社公布，以免为了完成计划数字而实行强迫摊派；（2）步犁、排犁、水车、药械由县社设站经营，而不再由基层社具体经营，以免基层社干部为克服资金的大量积压而不择手段地“大量销售”。在经营作风方面也提倡学会技术、带技术下乡；带步犁下田；架水车上井；包教、包会、包使用；群众自愿购买。反对只管推销不管技术指导；反对等客上门，坐待买主；反对推出门去不管及生逼硬派强迫命令等。因此，基层社的“坐等买卖”和“只管供应不管技术指导”的经营作风有了转变，强迫摊派现象也杜绝了。再加上省社与专署为基层社训练了一一○名技术干部，在技术上具体帮助农民，就使供应的物资都能发挥其应有效能。
    几点经验：
    第一、生产资料供应工作，特别是新式农具和化学肥料的推广工作，必须密切结合中心工作，以爱国增产为前提，广泛深入地进行宣传教育，充分发动群众。
    （1）用实例对比的方法进行宣传教育。如海阳三区霞石村农民过去没有使用化学肥料喂小麦的习惯，不少群众曾因使用不当而烧坏了庄稼，给今年推销化学肥料的工作增加了困难。根据这个情况，合作社召开了去年小麦丰产户与歉收户的座谈会，会上交流了经验和教训，群众很满意。会后四、五天时间，该村群众即买去化学肥料四千九百斤。干部说：“这个方法真对劲，去年春季摊派三次，销出不足二千五百斤，这次开了个座谈会，几天时间销售量就超过去年的一倍。”荣成沟陈家村农民周文清、陈锡盛去年春天一同买了肥田粉，周文清每亩小麦施用十四斤，陈锡盛害怕天旱没有使用，结果同样土地的麦田，周文清每亩小麦比陈锡盛的多打了三升
    （每升二十八斤）。陈锡盛有了这样的教训，今春一早便买化学肥料喂小麦。合作社根据这个实例，画成漫画，趁集日扩大宣传，陈家村的群众看到漫画，纷纷谈论：“一点不假，这是俺村的真事。”这种活人活事，实例对比的宣传，发挥了很大的效用。
    （2）发挥供销合作社的组织作用。为了作好生产资料供应工作，以合作社或零售店为单位，召开社员代表会议，邀请当地党、政负责同志作动员报告，进行爱国丰产教育，由合作社以自我批评的精神，检讨去年在供应生产资料工作中的片面任务观点和强迫命令作风，向代表们表示改正的决心和办法。在会上尽可能介绍典型例子，交流经验，或配合具体讲解与实地试验，使代表们真正知道新式农具和化学肥料的好处，以便会后具体地向社员群众传达。昆嵛县葛家联村社曾开过社员代表会，结果很好。
    第二、为了作好生产资料供应工作，合作社坚持了以互助合作组织为基础，以劳动模范为骨干的推广路线。滕家联村社所属北埠柳村今春共销售化学肥料一万二千斤，其中通过与互助组签订结合合同形式销出的有九千斤。昆嵛葛家联村社与三十四处互助组（包括一处生产社）签订结合合同，共订出步犁十八部，化学肥料八千斤。这样的推广路线，一方面满足了组织起来的农民提高生产的要求，保证更好地实现爱国丰产计划；另一方面通过有组织的农民带动个体农民，采用新式农具和化学肥料。荣城县斥山联村社所属龙山后村毕广杰互助组，买了二千二百斤化学肥料，将一四九亩小麦普遍追肥一次，该乡百分之九十的农民看见很有效果，也都在小麦田追施化学肥料。
    第三、供应生产资料，特别是新式农具和化学肥料，必须与加强技术指导相结合。今春文登专区合作社强调合作社干部都要学会技术，作到既是业务员又是技术员；发动合作社技术员到田野去，深入群众进行技术指导，作到包教、包会、包使用。有些基层社干部亲自为农民安装农具并教会使用，农民立刻体会到新式农具的好处。若干地方采取了在集日试验，组织群众参观，在互助合作代表会议上或互助组长会议上进行讲解试验和实地演习等办法，也得到良好的效果。威海长峰联村社所属山口村农民把去年买的一部步犁扛到地里不能使用，气的又摔又骂，准备仍用旧犁耕地。该社技术员于礼琛听到这个消息，立即去给他修理好，并教他使用，这位农民感动的说：“没有技术真吃不开，差一点把好东西扔掉。”昆嵛葛家联村社在代表会上演习步犁，到会的人争着扶犁试验，当技术被群众掌握以后，他们就毫无顾虑地购买步犁，当场即销出七部。
    第四、必须把反对官僚主义，命令主义的精神，贯彻到生产资料供应工作中去。工作作风的改善，是做好合作社工作的关键。入春以来，反对官僚主义、命令主义运动的开展，一方面制止了使用行政手段向群众摊派的现象，另一方面也造成了一部分干部害怕再犯强迫命令的错误而束手束脚的现象。有些干部不知道用什么方法来代替强迫摊派的作风，非常苦恼。根据这种情况，文登专区合作社就采用及时总结介绍好的经验，表扬好的单位与个人的方法，作用很大。现在这个方法已经成为推动干部转变作风的重要方法。
