[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Steel Industry College construction site of the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, starting in early April, launched a campaign among employees to oppose waste, oppose irresponsibility, and establish a responsibility system, in conjunction with construction preparation work. This campaign underwent thorough deliberation, exposed serious waste and irresponsibility, and has now entered the stage of establishing a responsibility system.

Before the campaign, the situation at this construction site was very chaotic. Construction preparation work began in February this year, and the student dormitory project, which could be constructed using readily available standard drawings, was originally scheduled to begin on April 20. However, due to the severe phenomenon of irresponsibility, problems affecting the start of construction, such as water and electricity supply and construction budgets, remained unresolved, leading to the failure of the construction start plan. At that time, the leading cadres of the construction site emphasized objective difficulties and adopted a waiting attitude. In early April, the leading cadres of the construction site held a cadre meeting to convey the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, mobilize the campaign against waste, against irresponsibility, and to establish a responsibility system, and organized administrative management cadres and technical personnel to study relevant documents. However, at that time, the leading cadres of the construction site did not have a clear understanding of the purpose and requirements of the campaign, worried that the campaign would hinder construction preparation work, and lacked sufficient ideological and institutional preparations. The Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League did not cooperate well, and some cadres and technical personnel had concerns about being held accountable and punished, so the campaign did not take off. Later, with the specific assistance of the Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the construction site re-launched this campaign from April 20.

At the beginning of the campaign, the leading cadres of the construction site accepted the previous lesson, mobilized cadres, technical personnel, and workers, especially emphasizing the significance, purpose, requirements, and methods of the campaign, criticizing certain incorrect understandings, and then organized cadres and technical personnel to study relevant documents and conduct discussions. During this period, many ideological problems were exposed among the employees. Some people worried that the leadership lacked determination and feared that the campaign would be a flash in the pan and not solve the problems. For example, some people said, "We have conducted campaigns against waste and irresponsibility in the past, but despite the opposition, waste remains waste, just like last year's campaign to establish a responsibility system, even if there were problems, they could not be resolved." A very small number of cadres and technical personnel believed that the campaign would ultimately lead to accountability and worried that it would come back to bite them.

After specifically studying these ideological situations, the leading cadres of the construction site held separate meetings of Party members, Youth League members, and cadres. At these meetings, the leading cadres further reiterated that the purpose of the campaign was to establish various responsibility systems by exposing waste and irresponsibility in construction, rather than punishing a few individuals; at the same time, they explained that the shortcomings of last year's campaign to establish a responsibility system were that the work in the construction phase was not well done, and the existing results were not consolidated. Therefore, a system research group was established at the beginning of this campaign to prepare for the construction phase of the campaign. At the meetings of cadres and technical personnel, the leading cadres also made a public self-criticism for the failure of the previous campaign, and also criticized the incorrect understandings among the employees. These measures played a significant role in dispelling the ideological concerns of the employees. At the beginning of the campaign, employees were also organized to conduct group discussions and chats. The employees checked themselves in light of their own thoughts and work, and gradually recognized the significance and purpose of the campaign.

After such thorough deliberation, the campaign moved to the exposure phase. At the mobilization meeting, the leading cadres especially emphasized that problems in the current construction preparation work should be exposed, and not only should the phenomena be exposed, but also the root causes should be found. After the mobilization meeting, more than 800 cases of waste and irresponsibility were exposed within three days. Through the exposure, not only was the serious situation of repeated rework and waste in temporary construction projects and the long delay in the start of formal projects caused by the chaos and irresponsibility in construction preparation work more comprehensively and systematically exposed, but also the employees further realized the huge losses brought to the country by irresponsibility, and universally stimulated the employees' hatred of the phenomenon of irresponsibility.

With the exposure of waste and irresponsibility, the construction site immediately adopted various effective rectification and improvement measures, which vigorously promoted the construction preparation work. For example, in the past, the responsibilities between the construction site and the three work sites were extremely unclear, and the system of responsibility of the work site director was not clearly established. A large number of cadres and technical personnel were controlled by the construction site, so the problems that should have been solved by the work site were pushed to the construction site, so that the work site could not play its due role, and the construction site was too busy, which affected the progress of the construction preparation work. After this unreasonable situation was discovered, the leading cadres of the construction site immediately strengthened the force of the work site, and initially delineated the scope of responsibilities, so that the work site truly became a fighting unit. For example, in the past, the material acceptance and supply work was very chaotic. The materials transported by trucks and carts were often placed everywhere because no one planned to store them and was responsible for accepting them, resulting in serious waste of materials being moved around the construction site. It is estimated that at least two-thirds of the more than 3,200 man-days spent on moving materials at the construction site were wasted. This time, the work methods were improved, the organization was adjusted, and the chaos in this area was gradually overcome. Due to unclear accounts and countless inventories, the materials department often caused blind procurement and backlog of large amounts of funds. This time, the accounting staff of the material supply section, together with the warehouse keepers, took stock of the inventory. The procedures for receiving materials and tools have also been simplified and initially improved this time. The material staff have been able to actively understand the project situation and issue materials according to the needs of the project, thus improving work efficiency. Workers generally reflected that before the start of the campaign, we could not find the material distributor for half a day, so we often stopped work and waited for materials and tools. For example, although the temporary construction project has now been basically completed, the quality of the project is poor due to the serious phenomenon of irresponsibility in the construction. For example, the frame of the workers' club has fallen by seven centimeters, and the pillar of the hardware warehouse has sunk by five centimeters, and there is a danger of collapse. After the launch of the campaign, the construction worker and technician automatically cooperated with the comrades of the inspection team of the construction site to conduct a major quality inspection of all temporary construction projects, and all the places where problems occurred were reinforced. For example, the wages of employees were originally scheduled to be paid every half month. Due to the dragging of work, workers often did not receive their wages until ten days or even half a month after the due date. This time, it took only three days to pay them all.

The sense of responsibility of the workers as masters has also been greatly improved in the campaign. For example, after the workers of the third construction site initially established the idea of economic accounting, they dug out 20 tons of white lime, 200 cubic meters of sand, and many useful building materials such as iron sheets, iron pipes, and firewood from the construction site where they worked last year. Two of the three construction team leaders in the first construction site were recently transferred from the third construction site when the construction site adjusted its organizational structure. They had quarreled over a small misunderstanding, and they didn't even talk to each other every day. In the campaign, they unfolded criticism and self-criticism, and eliminated the misunderstanding. They all said, "If we talk it over, then it's over. We can't let personal feelings affect the construction of the motherland." They are now often together to study work. The workers of the second construction site used to have many opinions on the construction worker, and the construction worker also felt that the workers were difficult to lead. They often said strange things, and some even asked to transfer their jobs. In this campaign, everyone reviewed their shortcomings and improved their relationship. Song Xue'an, the construction worker of the concrete prefabrication yard of the construction site, said, "The power of the campaign is really great! In the past, there were stones all over the prefabrication yard. If we asked the workers to pick them up, they would want wages (because it is piece-rate wages). Who knew that the campaign would change everything? Now the site is clean, even if a stone falls down, the workers will automatically pick it up." In the past, the carpenters in the model board prefabrication yard always picked the best materials to use, so there was often the phenomenon of using big materials for small purposes and wasting good wood. But now the carpenters have taken the initiative to study with the construction workers and technicians to use old materials as much as possible.

In the process of the campaign, the leading cadres of the construction site also held several special meetings to inspect and plan the construction preparation work, and various departments have formulated specific progress and plans to strive to complete the construction preparation work as soon as possible. On May 11, some projects have started, and various systems on the construction site are also being gradually established.

    结合施工准备建立责任制
    【本报讯】中央重工业部直属建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区，从四月上旬开始，结合施工准备工作，发动职工开展反对浪费、反对无人负责和建立责任制运动。这个运动经过了充分的酝酿，揭发了严重的浪费和无人负责现象，现在已进入建立责任制的阶段。
    运动开展之前，这个工区的情况非常混乱。从今年二月份起就开始了施工准备工作，一部分可用标准图施工的学生宿舍工程原计划在四月二十日开工，可是由于无人负责的现象很严重，影响开工的工程用水、用电和施工预算等问题一直得不到解决，以致开工计划落空了。当时工区领导干部强调客观困难，抱着等待的态度。四月上旬，工区领导干部召开干部大会传达了重工业部的指示，动员开展反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动，并组织行政管理干部和技术人员对有关文件进行了学习。可是当时工区领导干部对运动的目的、要求认识不明确，担心运动会妨碍施工准备工作，加以没有充分做好思想上与制度上的准备工作，党委、行政、工会、青年团各方面没有很好地配合，部分干部和技术人员有怕追究责任、怕受处分的顾虑，运动没有搞起来。后来在中央重工业部基本建设司的具体帮助下，该工区从四月二十日起又重新开展了这一运动。
    运动开始时，工区领导干部接受了上次教训，分别在干部、技术人员和工人群众中进行了动员，特别着重说明了运动的意义、目的、要求和进行的方法，批判了某些不正确认识，随后即组织干部和技术人员学习有关文件和进行讨论。这期间职工中暴露出不少思想问题。有人顾虑领导方面没有决心，怕运动虎头蛇尾，不解决问题，如有人说：“反浪费、反无人负责过去也都搞过，可是反归反，浪费还是浪费，像去年建立责任制运动一样，虽然有问题还是不能解决。”极少部分的干部和技术人员，认为反到最后总得追究责任，担心会反到自己头上来。
    工区领导干部具体地研究了这些思想情况后，分别召开了党员、团员和干部大会。在这些大会上，领导干部进一步反复说明运动的目的是通过揭发施工中的浪费和无人负责现象，从而建立各项责任制度，而不是要整那几个人；同时说明去年开展建立责任制运动的缺点是没有做好建设阶段的工作，没有巩固已有的成果。因此这次在运动开始时成立了制度研究组，就是为运动的建设阶段进行准备。在干部、技术人员的大会上，领导干部还对前一次运动没有搞得起来作了公开的检讨，同时对职工中的不正确认识也作了批判。这些措施对解除职工思想顾虑，起了很大的作用。运动开始时，还组织职工分组讨论和漫谈。职工们联系自己的思想和工作进行了检查，逐渐认识了运动的意义和目的。
    经过这样充分的酝酿，运动即转入揭发阶段。在动员大会上，领导干部特别强调要揭发当前施工准备工作中的问题，而且不仅揭发现象，还要找出根源。动员会后，三天内就揭发出浪费和无人负责事例八百多条。通过揭发，不仅比较全面和系统地暴露了由于施工准备工作中的混乱和无人负责所造成的暂设工程多处返工浪费和正式工程迟迟不能开工的严重情况，而且使职工进一步认识到因为无人负责给国家带来的巨大损失，普遍激发了职工群众痛恨无人负责现象的情绪。
    随着浪费和无人负责现象的揭发，该工区立即采取了各种有效的整顿和改进的措施，有力地推进了施工准备工作。例如过去工区与三个工地之间的职责极不分明，没有明确地建立工地主任负责制，大批干部和技术人员为工区所掌握，因此实际上应该由工地解决的问题都推到工区来，以致工地不能发挥应有的作用，而工区又忙不了，影响了施工准备工作的进展。这次发现这个不合理的情况后，工区领导干部立即充实了工地的力量，初步划清了职责范围，使工地真正成为一个作战单位。又如过去材料验收和供应工作很混乱，汽车、大车运来的材料，往往因为无人计划存放和负责验收，结果就四处乱放，造成了材料在工地上大搬家的严重浪费。据估计，在工地搬动材料用去的三千二百多个人工中，至少有三分之二是浪费掉的，这次改进了工作方法，调整了组织，逐步克服了在这方面的混乱情况。材料部门由于帐目不清、库存无数，还常常造成盲目采购、积压大量资金的现象，这次材料供应股会计人员会同仓库保管员把库存物资进行了清点。领料领工具的手续这次也得到简化和初步改进，材料员已能主动了解工程情况，根据工程需要发料了，因而提高了工作效率。工人普遍反映：在运动未开始前，我们一等半天都找不到发料人，因而常常停工待料待工具。又如暂设工程到现在虽然基本上完工了，但由于在施工中存在严重无人负责现象，工程质量低劣。如工人俱乐部房架已经掉下七公分，五金仓库柱子已下沉五公分，并有倒坍的危险。运动开展后，施工员、技术员即自动会同工区检查股同志将全部暂设工程作了一次质量大检查，对发生问题的地方都设法加固了。又如职工工资原定每半月发放一次，由于工作拖拉，工人往往在到期十天甚至半个月以后，还拿不到工资，这次只用三天时间就发放完毕。
    职工们的主人翁责任感在运动中也大为提高，例如第三工地工人在初步树立经济核算思想后，即到去年施工的工地泥土中挖出白灰二十吨、砂子二百立方公尺和很多铁皮、铁管、木柴等有用的建筑材料。第一工地的三个施工组长，有两个是在最近工区调整组织机构时从第三工地调来的。他们曾经为了一点小的误会闹别扭，每天在一起连话也不说。在运动中，展开了批评自我批评，消除了误会，他们都说：“话谈开了就拉倒，不能因为闹个人意气而影响到祖国的建设。”他们现在已经常在一起研究工作。第二工地工人过去对施工员意见很多，施工员也认为工人难领导，经常说怪话，甚至有的还要求调工作，在这次运动中，大家都检讨了自己的缺点，改善了关系。该工地混凝土预制场施工员宋学安说：“运动的力量真大呀！过去在预制场上满地都是石子，如果我们要工人拣起来，他们就要工资
    （因为是计件工资），谁知道运动一来就变样啦，现在现场上干干净净，即使掉下一粒石子，工人们也要自动的拣起来。”模型板预制场木工在过去总是什么料好使就拣什么料使，因此大材小用，浪费好木材的现象经常发生，可是现在木工们已主动地和施工员、技术员研究，尽量使用旧料。
    在运动过程中，工区领导干部还几次召开了专门会议，检查和计划施工准备工作，各部门并订出了争取提早做好开工准备工作的具体进度和计划。五月十一日部分工程已经开工，工地上的各种制度也在逐步建立起来。
