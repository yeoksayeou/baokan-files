Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The new Diet, which will decide on the selection of Japan's new Prime Minister, is about to convene its meeting on the 18th. The Yoshida Liberal Party, which failed to obtain a majority of seats in the House of Representatives in the general election, is carrying out intense activities in accordance with the wishes of the US-Japan monopoly capital to establish a "conservative coalition government" in order to accelerate the implementation of policies to revive Japanese militarism.

In order to establish a "conservative coalition government," the Yoshida Liberal Party actively launched activities to divide and win over various bourgeois opposition parties after the results of the House of Representatives election on April 19th were revealed, especially the Improvement Party led by Mamoru Shigemitsu, a Class-A war criminal who advocated rearmament. As Reuters Tokyo reported on April 20th, quoting a Japanese "political observer," "If you don't want to establish a government with only a few seats, which would create an unstable situation, then an understanding must be reached between the (Yoshida) Liberal Party and the Improvement Party." Deputy Prime Minister Takeo Ogata of the Yoshida government officially announced the content of this "understanding" on April 30th, which was to exchange the speaker or deputy speaker of the Diet for "the assistance of the Improvement Party outside the Diet." Kyodo News further revealed that "If the Improvement Party decides on a policy of providing assistance outside the Diet, it will in fact turn it into a ruling party. Starting temporarily from a separate minority party, gradually developing, and seizing the opportunity to realize a coalition government of conservative parties."

The purpose of the Yoshida Liberal Party's active pursuit of establishing a "conservative coalition government" is to be able to smoothly promote the policy of rearmament. Kyodo News revealed that Yoshida believes that in order to revise the constitution that renounces war in order to rearm, "it is necessary to reorganize the conservative camp to lay the foundation for a stable government." Such a reactionary regime is clearly what the US-Japan monopoly groups demand. Before the general election, Japanese monopolists, lacking confidence in whether the Yoshida Liberal Party could win the election, had already made preparations for this "coalition government of conservative parties." Reuters reported on April 20th, quoting Tokyo political "commentators" as saying: "All conservative parties rely on the industrial world to obtain campaign funds. It is believed that the donors insisted this time that the Liberal Party and the Improvement Party cooperate as a condition for continuing to provide financial support." After the end of the general election, Japanese monopoly capitalist organizations such as the "Federation of Economic Organizations" and the "Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry" have been urging Japanese reactionary parties to "play their role in establishing a strong and stable government."

The Japanese people's fervent opposition to Yoshida's return to power is greatly hindering the Yoshida Liberal Party's activities in organizing a "conservative coalition government." The differences and antagonism within the various bourgeois opposition parties are becoming more and more apparent. So far, no opposition party has been able to unanimously express its willingness to cooperate with the Yoshida Liberal Party. Although the Shigemitsu Improvement Party has expressed its willingness to "assist the Yoshida Liberal Party outside the Diet," it still does not give up its demand for "Shigemitsu to be the head of the cabinet." In order to obtain more concessions from the Yoshida Liberal Party, the Improvement Party reached an agreement in principle with the Hatoyama Liberal Party, the Right-wing Socialist Party, and the Left-wing Socialist Party on the 14th to jointly oppose the Yoshida Liberal Party.

In a statement issued on the 11th, the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that the Yoshida Liberal Party is wooing reactionary elements in the Improvement Party in an attempt to reorganize the cabinet to accelerate the rebuilding of the Japanese army and place it under US control. The statement clearly pointed out: "As long as the opposition parties cooperate with each other, this conspiracy can be thwarted." The statement also suggested that the Labor-Farmer Party and the Left-wing Socialist Party form a united front to prevent the Yoshida Liberal Party from forming the fifth Yoshida cabinet.

    吉田自由党企图建立“保守联合政权”复活军国主义
    日本共产党号召各反对党击败吉田阴谋
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：决定日本新首相人选的新国会即将从十八日开始召开会议。在大选中未能取得众院过半数议席的吉田自由党，正在按照美、日垄断资本的意旨为建立“保守联合政权”而进行着紧张的活动，以便加紧执行复活日本军国主义的政策。
    为了建立“保守联合政权”，吉田自由党在四月十九日众议员选举揭晓后，就积极地对各资产阶级在野党展开分化和拉拢的活动，特别是对以提倡重整军备的甲级战犯重光葵为首的改进党。正如路透社东京四月二十日电援引日本“政治观察家”的话所指出的：“如果不想建立一个只有少数席位的政府，因而造成不稳定的局面的话，那末必须在（吉田）自由党和改进党之间取得谅解。”吉田政府副首相绪方竹虎在四月三十日正式宣布了这种“谅解”的内容，就是以分配国会议长或副议长为条件，换取“改进党在国会外的协助”。共同社进一步透露说：“如果改进党决定了在国会外予以协助的方针，那就在事实上使它变成执政党。暂时从单独少数党出发，逐渐发展起来，有了机会就实现保守党派的联合政权。”
    吉田自由党积极谋求建立“保守联合政权”的目的，在于能够顺利地推行重整军备的政策。共同社透露，吉田认为：为了修改弃绝战争的宪法以便重整军备，“必须重新组成保守阵营，以奠定稳定的政权”。这样的一个反动政权，显然是美、日垄断集团所要求的。在大选以前，日本的垄断资本家由于对吉田自由党在大选中能否获胜缺乏信心，早已为这种“保守党派的联合政权”预先作了准备。路透社四月二十日电引东京政治“评论家们”的话说：“所有的保守党派都是依靠工业界得到竞选资金的。据信，捐款的人这次曾坚持要自由党和改进党合作，作为继续给予财政上的支持的条件。”在大选结束之后，日本垄断资本家的组织如“经济团体联合会”和“日本商工会议所”，又纷纷在督促日本各反动政党在“建立一个强有力的稳定的政权方面发挥它们的作用”。
    日本人民反对吉田重新上台的激昂情绪，大大妨碍着吉田自由党组织“保守联合政权”的活动。各资产阶级在野党内部的意见分歧和对立，一天天表面化。迄今还没有一个在野党能够意见一致地表示愿意和吉田自由党合作，重光葵改进党虽然表示过愿“在国会外协助”吉田自由党，但仍然不放弃“以重光为组阁首长”的要求。为了取得吉田自由党更多的让步，改进党十四日和鸠山自由党、右派社会党、左派社会党三个在野党在原则上取得协议，共同反对吉田自由党。
    日本共产党在十一日发表声明指出：吉田自由党正在拉拢改进党中的反动分子，企图重新组阁以加速重建日本军队，并置于美国的控制之下。声明明确指出：“只要各反对党互相合作，这种阴谋是可以挫败的。”声明并建议劳农党和左派社会党结成统一战线，阻止吉田自由党组成第五次吉田内阁。
