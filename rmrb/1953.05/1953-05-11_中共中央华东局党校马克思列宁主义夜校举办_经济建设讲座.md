According to the *Liberation Daily*, in order to implement the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's instructions on cadre theoretical education for 1953-1954, the Marxist-Leninist Evening School attached to the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau Party School has launched "Economic Construction Lectures" to assist cadres from East China-level organs and the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee organs in their theoretical study of economic construction. The participants are mainly study tutors and those preparing to become study tutors from the aforementioned organs. In addition, a portion of education cadres from the organs have also been included. The students participating in the "Economic Construction Lectures" possess a certain level of political and theoretical understanding, with the majority being section and division-level cadres in the organs. Before enrollment, all have undergone review and approval by the Party committee and have passed an entrance examination.

The teaching content of the "Economic Construction Lectures" primarily focuses on Chapters Nine to Twelve of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," combined with reading several documents by Lenin and Stalin on socialist economic construction, and supplemented by special reports on China's economic construction. The teaching method emphasizes both classroom instruction and self-study, with necessary discussions organized based on the issues. A summary of learning is conducted at the end of each unit and each stage of learning. The entire course is organized into four units based on the order of Chapters Nine to Twelve of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," with study advisors from East China-level organs serving as lecturers. The total study time is tentatively set at three to four months.

The lectures officially commenced on April 25th, with Comrade Kuang Yaming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, providing many instructions on study methods. Formal classes began on April 29th, with Comrade Li Zhengwen delivering an introductory report on Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)."

While preparing for the "Economic Construction Lectures," the evening school also launched "Lectures on Soviet Socialist Economics" in April, with a total of 374 participants, mostly theoretical education cadres from organs and cadre schools, as well as political teachers from universities and secondary schools, scheduled to conclude within two months.
