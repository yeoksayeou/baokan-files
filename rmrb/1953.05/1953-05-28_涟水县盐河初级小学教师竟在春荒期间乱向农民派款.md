Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Lianshui County Yanhe Elementary School Teachers Indiscriminately Levy Funds from Farmers During the Spring Famine
    Wang Shuren of the Propaganda Department of the Lianshui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province writes: Sun Zhidong, a teacher at Yanhe Elementary School in Xian District, Yancha Township, Lianshui County, and Sun Xianchao (Township Cultural and Educational Committee Member), without the approval of county and district leaders, through the village cadres of Yanhe Village, arbitrarily levied money from farmers in the village based on the amount of land they owned to build a school; the total amount of funds to be raised was originally planned to be 900,000 yuan, with each mu of land being assessed 750 yuan. Now is the time of the spring famine, and the lives of farmers are very difficult, but they disregard the suffering of the masses and forcibly demand money from them. Sun Songshi, who is over sixty years old, was assessed 5,000 yuan, which she cannot afford; but the cadres insisted on it, forcing her to run to the township government and cry. It is suggested that the Lianshui County People's Government quickly stop this illegal levy and return the collected funds to the farmers respectively in order to reverse the adverse effects.

    涟水县盐河初级小学教师竟在春荒期间乱向农民派款
    中共江苏省涟水县委宣传部王树人来信：涟水县锡恩区盐岔乡盐河初级小学教师孙志东和孙献朝
    （乡文教委员）两人，不经县区领导部门批准，就通过盐河村村干部擅自向该村农民按田亩派钱建筑学校；筹款总数原计划是九十多万元，每亩田要摊派七百五十元。现在正值春荒，农民生活很困难，但他们却不管群众疾苦，硬向群众催要，六十多岁的孙宋氏派到五千元钱，出不起；但干部硬要，逼得她跑到乡政府去大哭。建议涟水县人民政府迅速制止这种非法摊派行为，并把已收的款分别退回农民，以挽回不良影响。
