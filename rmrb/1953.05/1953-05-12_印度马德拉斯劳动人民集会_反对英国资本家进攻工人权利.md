Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to India's "Crossroads Weekly," 20,000 working people in Madras recently held a rally in Triplicane to oppose the British capitalists' conspiracy to further exploit workers and attack their rights at the Madras Tramway Company.

The British company, which has been in operation for sixty years, closed down on April 11th at midnight. About 1,650 workers were thus unemployed. More than 125,000 citizens who ride the tram daily have been greatly inconvenienced.

According to the British capitalists, the reason for the closure is that the company is losing 40,000 to 50,000 rupees per month. The manager currently responsible for the company's affairs said at a press conference: he "does not want to run the tram business, and he can only do it on the basis of streamlining." However, the capitalists' so-called "losses" are nothing more than a pretext to cover up their conspiracy. This company has made a net profit of 1.8 million rupees annually in the last three years.

The real intention of this sudden closure is that the British capitalists want to use the name of "streamlining" to dismiss 294 workers.

The British capitalists have adopted cunning methods, handing the company over to a manager nominated by the board of directors of the bondholders. This manager is the former manager of the company. The company attempts to suspend operations in the short term. Then, a "new" management agency reopens with a new group of personnel and stipulates new working conditions (that is, preventing workers from struggling for legitimate demands).

This conspiracy of the British big capitalists has aroused the indignation of the working people. 20,000 people held a rally on Triplicane Beach. The meeting was presided over by Bigayazhou, chairman of the Red Flag Trade Union Federation. Leaders of the Communist Party of India spoke at the meeting. Speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned the tyrannical attitude of the British capitalists.

### 印度马德拉斯劳动人民集会  反对英国资本家进攻工人权利

    印度马德拉斯劳动人民集会
    反对英国资本家进攻工人权利
    【新华社讯】据印度“十字路周报”报道：马德拉斯两万劳动人民最近在垂普里坎举行大会，反对英国资本家开的马德拉斯电车公司进一步剥削工人和进攻工人权利的阴谋。
    这家开办了六十年的英国公司从四月十一日午夜起关门。约一千六百五十名工人因而失业。天天乘电车的十二万五千多市民受到很大的困难。
    据英国资方说，关门的原因是这家公司每月蚀本四万到五万卢比。目前负责该公司事务的管理人在记者招待会上说：他“不想经营电车这个行业，只有在精简的基础上他才能做这个事。”但是资方的所谓“蚀本”无非是借此来掩饰他们的阴谋而已。这家公司在最近三年内每年就净赚一百八十万卢比。
    这次突然关门的真正用意是，英国资方要想借“精简”之名解雇二百九十四名工人。
    英国资方采取狡猾的手法，把这个公司交给债券持有者的董事会所提名的一个管理人。这位管理人便是该公司的前经理。公司企图在短期内停止营业。然后，“新的”管理机构用一批新的人员，并规定新的工作条件（即阻止工人进行合法要求的斗争）重新开张。
    英国大资本家的这种阴谋激起了劳动人民的愤慨。两万人在垂普里坎海滩举行大会。大会由红旗职工联合会主席比加耶周主持。印度共产党的领袖在会上讲话。在会上发言的人一致斥责英国资本家的横暴态度。
