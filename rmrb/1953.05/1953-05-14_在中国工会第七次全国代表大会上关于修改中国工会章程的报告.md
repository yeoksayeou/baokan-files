Comrades and Delegates:

Our country has rapidly moved from the period of economic recovery into a period of planned economic construction. The level of consciousness and organization of the Chinese working class has also been unprecedentedly improved with the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. The historical tasks of the Chinese workers' movement pointed out by the Sixth National Labor Congress have now been victoriously completed. The Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions passed by the Sixth National Labor Congress is no longer suitable for the changed and developed situation today, so it must be revised and supplemented according to the new situation and new experiences today. The charter formulated by the Sixth National Labor Congress was named the "Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions." Due to the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and according to the current situation that the national trade union organization has been completely unified, the "Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions" must first be renamed "Constitution of the Trade Unions of the People's Republic of China." The following is an explanation of some of the main points regarding the revision of the trade union constitution.

First, on the Nature, Tasks, and Role of Trade Unions under the People's Democratic Dictatorship

In the resolutions of the Sixth National Labor Congress, there were principled provisions regarding the nature, tasks, and role of trade unions under the people's democratic dictatorship, that is, the regulations on the guiding principles and tasks of the workers' movement in the liberated areas at that time. Those regulations were correct. However, due to the limitations of the historical conditions at that time, it was impossible to solve these fundamental problems more comprehensively in the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions passed by the Sixth National Labor Congress. Therefore, these fundamental problems must be more clearly stipulated in this revision of the constitution.

Chinese trade unions are mass organizations of the Chinese working class. They must adhere to the nature of the working class's class organization, must draw a clear line between the working class and the exploiting classes, and distinguish the working class from independent producers (independent producers are also laborers, but they are also small private owners, not wage laborers, and there is a distinction from workers), so as to strictly maintain the class nature and purity of trade union organizations.

The modern Chinese workers' movement developed under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party after its establishment. This is a characteristic of the Chinese workers' movement and one of its best traditions. The great and wise Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party are the banner of victory for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. Without the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no modern revolutionary workers' movement in China. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no victory for the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese trade unions unite the broad masses of workers around the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao.

Chinese trade unions are mass organizations of the working class, voluntarily formed by workers on the basis of industrial principles and democratic centralism, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or religious belief. All members participating in trade union organizations should do so voluntarily. Only trade unions established on the principle of voluntarism can guarantee the mass character of trade union organizations, make trade unions truly become their own organizations of the working masses, and make it possible for the working masses to abide by the constitution of the trade unions and maintain the discipline of the trade unions on a conscious basis, and give play to the role that trade union organizations should play in national construction.

Before the working class and the people of the whole country won the revolutionary victory in the entire country, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the task of the trade unions was to organize and educate the workers under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and to fight for the overthrow of the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. At that time, the working class was still in a state of being oppressed, exploited, and ruled, and was a proletariat with nothing to lose. In order to maintain their minimum living standards, they endured cruel exploitation under harsh working conditions, working for the reactionary rulers and exploiters. At that time, the trade unions had to lead the working masses to carry out legal and illegal economic struggles under all possible and favorable conditions, and closely integrate them with political struggles. Every economic struggle carried out by the trade unions at that time had the significance of political struggle. But this was the past situation. The current situation is completely different. Now the Chinese working class has become the leading class of the country. The guiding principles, tasks, and role of trade union work under the people's democratic dictatorship have undergone fundamental changes because of this great historical change. If we do not recognize this change and still use the guiding principles, tasks, and working methods of trade union work that we used in the Kuomintang rule, it is completely wrong. The essence of this error is to confuse the people's democratic dictatorship with the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang in the past, and to confuse the relationship between the working class and the state-owned enterprises that have become socialist in nature with the relationship with the capitalist enterprises in the Kuomintang era. The result is bound to lead the working class to oppose the regime it leads and the socialist enterprises it has seized for itself, and embark on the road of economism and trade unionism.

After the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country achieved revolutionary victory in the entire country, the basic task of the trade union is to: defend the fruits of the people's victory and consolidate the people's democratic power. And developing production and struggling for national industrialization is the central link in consolidating the people's democratic power, the greatest interest of the working class and the people of the whole country, and the fundamental guarantee for our country to gradually transition from new democracy to socialist society. Therefore, the trade unions under the people's democratic dictatorship must take doing a good job in production as their regular central task, and on this basis, care for and gradually improve the material and cultural lives of the working masses.

In state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature, the working class is the master of the enterprise, and workers have a sacred responsibility to do a good job in production and ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the state's production plans. In joint state-private enterprises and enterprises that are fixed to process and order goods for the state, workers also have a major responsibility for doing a good job in production, but at the same time, they must supervise the implementation of contracts and fight against illegal acts such as capitalists cutting corners and evading taxes. In private enterprises of a capitalist nature, although there is still class antagonism and the working masses are still subjected to a certain degree of exploitation, under the current conditions, the existence of private enterprises that are beneficial rather than harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood is still necessary. Therefore, trade union organizations in private enterprises should implement the policy of "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital," and have the responsibility to unite capitalists to do a good job in production under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and supervise the implementation of state policies and laws, and fight against all illegal acts of capitalists.

Chinese trade unions should educate the broad masses of workers with patriotism and communism, and constantly educate the working masses on the unity of national interests and individual interests, long-term interests and current interests. Strive to improve the political, cultural, and technical levels of the working masses. Chinese trade unions should fully promote the spirit of internationalism, actively participate in the international workers' movement, fight for the unity of the international workers' movement, and fight to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

Second, on the Question of Trade Union Membership

Article 3 of the Constitution passed by the Sixth National Labor Congress stipulates: "This association is based on group membership. Employee groups within China, who approve of the Constitution of this association, regardless of industrial unions, occupational unions, or local unions, may join this association as members..." It was correct to make such regulations at that time. Because at that time, there were still various employee groups in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and it was impossible to adopt today's organizational form. In order to unite the forces of the working class throughout the country at that time, it was only possible to adopt the method of basing on group membership. But the situation has now changed. With the victory of the people's revolution and the unification of the country, Chinese trade unions are no longer an alliance of different organizations of some local workers, but a unified mass organization of the working class throughout the country. Therefore, the previous provision of "based on group membership" must be revised.

The draft constitution stipulates: "All manual and mental laborers whose wage income is the entire or main source of their means of subsistence, who acknowledge this constitution, may join the trade union as members." The following two points explain this provision:

1.  All those who have been deprived of political rights by the People's Government cannot be allowed to join the trade union. Because these people have been deprived of their political rights such as speech, assembly, and association, they naturally have no right to join the trade union. Some of these people exploited and oppressed the working people in the past, some were counter-revolutionary elements who betrayed the motherland, and some were elements who violated state laws and were sentenced to imprisonment.

2. The draft constitution stipulates: "All manual and mental laborers whose wage income is the entire or main source of their means of subsistence, who acknowledge this constitution, may join the trade union as members." This means that all workers, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or religious belief, who meet the conditions stipulated in Article 1 of the draft constitution can join the trade union as members. That is to say, all manual laborers (such as farmers and small handicraftsmen) and mental laborers (such as certain self-employed mental laborers) whose wage income is not the entire or main source of their means of subsistence should not join the trade union as members. In the past, in some areas, two incorrect tendencies occurred regarding the issue of workers joining the union: the first was the tendency of closed-doorism. Some people inappropriately set the conditions for trade union membership too high, adding many unnecessary restrictions, making it impossible for many workers to join the trade union. For example, workers with backward ideological consciousness were not allowed to join the trade union, but active, capable, and educated workers were required, and even writing autobiographies, holding oaths, joining the union ceremony, and being certified by the Farmers' Association and approved by the County Federation of Trade Unions were required before joining the union. These practices are all wrong. This is a failure to understand that one of the basic functions of the trade union is to educate workers, and it is precisely necessary to absorb these not very conscious workers into the trade union organization in order to better educate them and improve their class consciousness. The second is the tendency of formalism. That is, some people only pursue the number of trade union members, to the extent that they also pull in non-working class components, such as small handicraftsmen and self-employed individuals. This practice is also wrong.

Third, on the Rights and Obligations of Members

The draft constitution stipulates that every trade union member has the following rights: First, the right to vote and stand for election. Second, the right to propose opinions and suggestions to the trade union organization for improving work. Third, the right to criticize any staff member of the trade union at the trade union meeting or in publications. Fourth, the right to enjoy priority in various collective cultural and welfare undertakings organized by the trade union. We believe that these provisions on the rights of members in the draft constitution are very necessary.

Why is it necessary to stipulate the rights of trade union members? Because:

1. Only by clearly stipulating and guaranteeing the rights of trade union members can the democratic life and democratic system of the trade union be guaranteed. Trade union organizations at all levels, from the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to every grassroots committee, should be democratically elected by the members' representative congress or the general membership meeting of trade union organizations at all levels from bottom to top; and the representatives participating in the representative congresses at all levels should also be democratically elected by the members from bottom to top. If it is not stipulated that members have the right to vote and stand for election, the trade union cannot be established on the basis of democratic centralism and become its own organization of the broad masses of workers.

2. Only by clearly stipulating and guaranteeing the rights of trade union members can trade union work be truly established on the basis of the masses and continuously improved and strengthened with the active participation and support of the broad masses of workers. Since the trade union is a mass organization of the working class, trade union work is of course mass work. If it is not stipulated that every trade union member has the right to propose opinions and suggestions to the trade union organization for improving work, it is impossible to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses of members to participate in trade union work, to absorb the opinions and suggestions of the masses, and to do a good job in trade union work under the supervision of the masses.

3. Only by clearly stipulating and guaranteeing the rights of trade union members can the development of criticism and self-criticism within the trade union, especially the development of criticism from bottom to top, be guaranteed, and the correctness of trade union leadership be guaranteed. Any behavior that refuses criticism is a violation of the principle of democratic life of the trade union, and we must always pay attention to fighting against this behavior of suppressing criticism and undermining the democratic life of the trade union.

4. Only by clearly stipulating and guaranteeing the rights of trade union members not only in democratic life and democratic systems, but also in enjoying the various collective cultural and welfare undertakings organized by the trade union, can members be distinguished from non-members, so that members feel the honor and responsibility of becoming trade union members, so that they actively care about trade union work, and it is also an education for non-members who should participate but have not yet participated in the trade union, encouraging them to actively participate in trade union organizations.

Trade union organizations at all levels should respect these rights of every trade union member and must not infringe upon them. All behaviors that infringe upon the rights of trade union members are behaviors that violate the constitution of the trade union. Trade union organizations at all levels should constantly educate every trade union member about the rights of members, so that every trade union member understands that they have these rights and understands the importance of using these rights.

The draft constitution stipulates that every trade union member has the following obligations: First, abide by state laws and labor discipline. Second, cherish public property. Third, work hard to study politics, technology, and culture, and improve their class consciousness and work ability. Fourth, abide by the trade union constitution and resolutions, and pay membership dues on time. These provisions on the obligations of members in the draft constitution are very important and very necessary.

Why is it necessary to stipulate these obligations for members? Because:

1. The Chinese working class has become the leading class of our country's people's democratic power. Therefore, every employee should understand that since the state power is their own, they should cherish and consolidate this power, and consciously abide by the policies, laws and labor discipline of the People's Government. Those who undermine government laws and labor discipline should be fought against.

2. It is necessary to cherish public property. Because public property is socialist property owned by the working class and the people of the whole country, it is the material basis for our country's industrialization and gradual transition to a socialist society, as well as for improving the material and cultural lives of all laborers. Therefore, public property is sacred and inviolable. Every member should cherish it and wage a resolute struggle against phenomena such as embezzlement, waste, and damage to public property, as well as not caring for and cherishing public property.

3. To successfully shoulder the task of national construction, every member must work hard to study politics, technology, and culture, and improve their class consciousness and work ability. Otherwise, it will be difficult to shoulder the task of national construction. Therefore, every member should study hard, especially learn from the Soviet Union.

4. To successfully realize national industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society, it is necessary to have a strong and combative trade union organization. Therefore, strengthening the construction of trade union organizations is the common responsibility of all members. And an important condition for strengthening trade union construction is that every member must abide by the trade union constitution and resolutions, and pay membership dues on time.

In short, as long as every member can fulfill these obligations well, the combat strength of the trade union organization will be further improved. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels should constantly educate members on the obligations of members stipulated in the draft constitution. In this way, the class consciousness and sense of responsibility of the members will definitely be improved, and the combat effectiveness of the trade union organization will definitely be strengthened, thereby powerfully promoting the development of production.

Fourth, on the Organizational Principles and Organizational Structure of Trade Unions

1.  Trade unions are established on the basis of democratic centralism

The draft constitution stipulates: Trade unions are established on the basis of democratic centralism. Its basic system is: (1) The leading organs of trade unions at all levels must be democratically elected by members from bottom to top and report their work to members regularly. (2) Trade union organizations at all levels must carry out their work in accordance with the trade union constitution and organizational resolutions. (3) The resolutions of trade unions at all levels must be passed with the approval of more than half of those present at the meeting. (4) Lower-level trade union organizations are subordinate to higher-level trade union organizations.

Some of our trade union organizations have failed to convene membership meetings or representative meetings for a long time, report their work and expenditure of funds to them, or conduct elections on schedule. They have also failed to develop criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from bottom to top, causing trade union organizations to become divorced from the masses and unable to receive supervision from bottom to top. This has led to the growth of bureaucracy, commandism and illegal and undisciplined phenomena in trade union organizations. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, many trade union organizations underwent rectification, but normal democratic life systems and frequent criticism and self-criticism are still lacking. Recently, we have received many letters from the working masses exposing the shortcomings of trade union cadres, which is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the leadership. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must overcome bureaucratic and red tape style of work. Chairman Mao taught us: "If all work only puts forward tasks without paying attention to the working methods when implementing them, without opposing bureaucratic working methods but adopting practical and concrete working methods, and without abandoning commandist working methods but adopting patient and persuasive working methods, then no task can be accomplished."

Trade union organizations at all levels must abide by the provisions of the trade union constitution to regularly report their work and the expenditure of trade union funds to members, establish a normal democratic life system of trade unions and frequent criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from bottom to top, and place trade union organizations under the supervision of the broad masses of workers. Only in this way can trade unions gain the support of the broad masses of workers, closely link trade unions with the broad masses of workers, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of workers to complete and over fulfill the state's production tasks. Only in this way can the organization and discipline of the masses of workers be strengthened on a conscious basis.

2.  Trade unions are established according to industrial principles

Organizing trade unions according to industrial principles is of great significance for ensuring the implementation of national production plans and solving workers' problems related to production, wages, labor protection, and labor insurance. The so-called establishment of trade union organizations according to industrial principles means: (1) Organizing trade union members of the same enterprise, agency, and other units in the grassroots organizations of the same industrial union, rather than organizing trade union members of the same enterprise, agency, and other units according to the principles of different occupations. If trade union members of the same enterprise, agency, and other units are divided into several different organizations according to their occupations, it will not be conducive to doing a good job in production, nor will it be conducive to the unity of the working class. (2) Organizing trade union members in the same industrial sector of the national economy into a national industrial union organization so as to ensure the completion and over fulfillment of the state's production plans according to the characteristics of each industrial sector and the needs of national construction, and on this basis, to conduct unified and centralized education for the working class and solve problems related to working conditions and living welfare. Strengthening the work of industrial unions in a planned and focused manner is necessary when the state is carrying out planned economic construction. (3) Local trade union organizations should also be established according to industrial principles whenever possible. Local federations of trade unions at all levels are the joint leading organs of industrial union organizations and local trade union organizations in the respective localities. Local trade union organizations have played a significant role in the construction of trade union organizations in the past, and will continue to play a significant role in the establishment and improvement of industrial unions and the development of national trade union work in the current and foreseeable future. While strengthening the work of industrial unions in a focused manner, the role of local trade union organizations should not be ignored.

3.  The draft constitution stipulates: "The plenary meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions elects the Presidium and the Secretariat." In the past, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was led by the Standing Committee to lead daily work. Now, in order to more centrally strengthen the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the leadership of various industrial unions, the Presidium and the Secretariat are established.

The Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is the leading organ of the national trade union during the recess of the Executive Committee, implements the resolutions of the National Congress and the Executive Committee, and leads all work of the national trade union.

The Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions handles the daily work of the national trade union under the leadership of the Presidium.

The draft constitution stipulates: some industrial unions have a presidium to lead daily work, and some industrial unions still have a standing committee to lead daily work. The reason is: some industries are more concentrated and trade union organizations are more sound, and it is more appropriate to adopt the organizational form of the Presidium; while the organizations of some industrial unions are not sound enough, so they still have a standing committee to lead daily work.

4.  The draft constitution stipulates: trade union organizations at all levels shall establish finance review committees, and the financial reports of trade union organizations at all levels must be signed and sealed by the chairman of the finance review committee in order to be valid. The purpose is to fully promote democracy and enable trade union members to supervise the correct use of trade union funds.

5.  The draft constitution stipulates: the name of the local trade union organization is changed to the local federation of trade unions. The reason is: in the past, local trade union organizations at all levels were called trade union federations, so there were too many trade union federations. In fact, the local trade union is a joint leading organ of various industrial union organizations and local trade union organizations, so it is renamed the Federation of Trade Unions. In the future, in addition to strengthening the leadership of industrial unions, provincial federations of trade unions should also strengthen the leadership of county and town trade unions. The work of county and town trade unions should strengthen the work of handicraft workers, except for a few industries.

Fifth, on the Question of Grassroots Trade Union Organizations

1.  Grassroots trade union organizations are the foundation of trade unions

Grassroots trade union organizations are the foundation of trade unions. They directly approach and connect with the masses. All trade union work must be carried out through grassroots organizations. The success or failure of the establishment of grassroots trade union organizations is the key to determining the entire trade union work. Therefore, we must concentrate our efforts on doing a good job in grassroots work.

The draft constitution stipulates: grassroots trade union organizations are composed of trade union members in the same enterprise or agency. The establishment of grassroots trade union organizations in this way according to industrial principles is of decisive significance for strengthening the unity of workers and staff, ensuring the improvement of labor productivity, and improving the material and cultural lives of workers and staff.

However, due to the complexity and uneven development of China's economy, private small enterprises still account for a considerable proportion. Therefore, it is necessary to have clear regulations on where grassroots trade union organizations are established. Comprehensive large enterprises, such as factories and mines in Anshan and Fushun, can establish grassroots trade union committees according to workshops and wellheads. Secondly, in the construction industry, grassroots committees can basically be established according to building materials factories and construction sites, but because construction workers are highly mobile, company-level trade union organizations should still be retained. Single large factories, such as some large textile factories and tram companies, can establish grassroots committees at the branch level, but this must be approved by higher-level trade unions. Processing factories and small factories that make a certain part, with 25 or more people, must establish grassroots trade union committees; those with less than 25 people shall elect one organizer; those with less than three people shall participate in nearby trade union organizations of similar industries or professions or form joint groups.

2.  On the establishment of workshop committees

All large factories and large workshops should establish workshop committees regardless of shifts or types of work. This is beneficial to production and facilitates the education of workers and the solution of livelihood problems. Small factories and small workshops do not need to establish workshop committees, but can form groups. Because there are very few people in the unit, having too many levels will affect the in-depth work, and there is nothing to do with establishing a workshop committee.

3.  Regarding the establishment of groups, the draft constitution stipulates: trade union groups should be established according to production work shifts or work units, and should not be established according to the number of people, gender, free combination, or other methods. The trade union group is the unit of daily activities of the working masses, and the strength of the trade union group is of great significance to grassroots work. This trade union group established according to production and shifts is both conducive to production and to the education of workers and the solution of workers' livelihood problems.

4.  Regarding the establishment of various work committees of the grassroots committee and the workshop committee, the draft constitution stipulates: the grassroots trade union committee and the workshop (or department) committee may establish various work committees according to work needs. The reason why it is necessary to make such a provision in the constitution is that the establishment of a work committee must be based on the needs and possibilities of the work of the trade union of each factory and workshop. For example, larger factories, workshops or factories and workshops with better work often have work committees for production, wages (rationalization proposals can be included), culture and education, labor insurance, labor protection, mutual assistance, and residential life. Smaller factories or workshops do not need to establish work committees, and each member is responsible for leading daily work.

Sixth, on the organization of the handicraft industry federation of trade unions

The draft constitution stipulates: "The organizational method of the handicraft industry federation of trade unions shall be formulated separately." The reason is that handicrafts are not only different from modern industries, but also have different conditions in different regions. Therefore, the organizational forms and methods of industrial workers cannot be used to organize handicraft workers. How to organize handicraft workers should be stipulated separately. I suggest that the congress authorize the next Executive Committee to study and handle this issue.

That is all I have to say about the report on the revision of the constitution.

In short, strengthening trade union organizations at all levels, strengthening industrial unions, strengthening the work of grassroots trade union organizations, promoting trade union democracy, and improving trade union systems are important tasks for the current trade union construction. Only by successfully completing these tasks can we further consolidate and improve the combat strength of the working class and successfully complete the glorious tasks of the national five-year plan.

专栏：

    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上关于修改中国工会章程的报告
    许之桢各位代表、各位同志：
    我们的国家已经由经济恢复时期迅速走入有计划的经济建设时期。中国工人的觉悟程度和组织程度也随着中国人民革命的胜利获得了空前的提高。第六次全国劳动大会所指出的关于中国职工运动的历史任务到现在已经胜利地完成了。第六次全国劳动大会所通过的中华全国总工会章程，已不适合今天变化了和发展了的情况，因此必须根据今天新的情况和新的经验来加以修改和补充。第六次全国劳动大会所制定的章程名为“中华全国总工会章程”。由于中华人民共和国的建立，并根据目前全国工会组织业已完全统一的情况，所以首先须要把“中华全国总工会章程”改名为“中华人民共和国工会章程”。以下就是关于修改工会章程的某些要点的说明。
    第一、关于人民民主专政下工会的性质、任务与作用问题
    在第六次全国劳动大会的决议中，关于人民民主专政下工会的性质、任务与作用，已有原则的规定，即当时关于解放区的职工运动的方针任务的规定。那些规定是正确的。但是由于当时历史条件的限制，在第六次全国劳动大会所通过的中华全国总工会章程中，还不可能更全面地解决这些问题，因此，在这次修改章程时，必须把这些根本问题加以更明确的规定。
    中国工会是中国工人阶级的群众组织。它必须坚持工人阶级的阶级组织的性质，它必须划清工人阶级与剥削阶级的界限，分别工人阶级与独立生产者（独立生产者也是劳动者，但他们又是小私有者，而不是工资劳动者，和工人是有区别的），以严格保持工会组织的阶级性和纯洁性。
    中国现代的工人运动，是在中国共产党产生以后，在中国共产党的直接领导下发展起来的。这是中国工人运动的特点，也是中国工人运动最优良的传统之一。伟大英明的毛主席和中国共产党是中国工人阶级和中国人民胜利的旗帜。没有中国共产党，就没有中国现代革命的工人运动。没有中国共产党的领导，就没有中国人民的胜利。中国工会在中国共产党的领导下，把广大工人群众团结在中国共产党和伟大的毛主席的周围。
    中国工会是由工人们按照产业原则，在民主集中制的基础上，不分民族、性别及宗教信仰自愿结合起来的工人阶级的群众组织。所有参加工会组织的会员，都应该是自愿参加的。只有根据自愿的原则建立起来的工会，才能保证工会组织的群众性，才能使工会真正成为工人群众自己的组织，才有可能使工人群众在自觉的基础上遵守工会的章程，维持工会的纪律，发挥工会组织在国家建设中应有的作用。
    在工人阶级和全国人民取得全国范围的革命胜利以前，在国民党反动统治下，工会的任务就是在中国共产党的领导下组织和教育工人，为推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治而斗争。那时的工人阶级还处在被压迫、被剥削、被统治的地位，是一无所有的无产者，他们为了维持自己的最低生活，在恶劣的劳动条件下忍受着残酷的剥削，为反动的统治者、剥削者做工。当时工会必须领导工人群众在一切可能的和有利的条件下进行合法和非法的经济斗争，并使之与政治斗争紧密相结合。当时工会所进行的每一个经济斗争，都具有政治斗争的意义。但这是过去的情形。现在的情形已经完全不同了，现在中国工人阶级已经成为国家的领导阶级了。在人民民主专政下的工会工作的方针、任务与作用，已经因为这种伟大的历史变革而发生了根本的变化。如果不认识这种变化，仍然搬用过去我们在国民党统治时期的工会工作的方针、任务和工作方法，那是完全错误的。这种错误的实质就是把人民民主专政的政权与过去的国民党反动政权混同起来，就是把工人阶级对已经成为社会主义性质的国营企业的关系和过去对国民党时代资本主义企业的关系混同起来，其结果就必然要引导工人阶级与自己所领导的政权，与已经为自己所占有的社会主义企业相对立，而走上经济主义和工联主义的道路。
    中国工人阶级和全国人民在全国范围内取得了革命胜利以后，工会的基本任务就是：保卫人民胜利的果实，巩固人民民主政权。而发展生产，为国家工业化而斗争，是巩固人民民主政权的中心环节，是工人阶级和全国人民的最大利益，是我国从新民主主义逐步过渡到社会主义社会的根本保证。因此，人民民主专政下的工会，就必须以搞好生产为自己经常的中心任务，并在这个基础上，关心并逐步改善工人群众的物质生活与文化生活。
    在社会主义性质的国营企业中，工人阶级是企业的主人，工人对搞好生产，保证完成和超额完成国家的生产计划，负有神圣的责任。在公私合营和固定为国家加工定货的企业中，工人对搞好生产也负有重大的责任，但同时须监督契约的执行，向资本家偷工减料、偷税漏税等不法行为作斗争。在资本主义性质的私营企业中，虽然还有阶级对抗的存在，工人群众还受着一定程度的剥削，但在目前的条件下，对国计民生有利而不是有害的私营企业的存在还是必要的。因此，私营企业中的工会组织，应贯彻“发展生产，劳资两利”的政策，有责任团结资本家在国营经济领导下搞好生产，并监督国家政策法令的贯彻执行，与资本家一切不法行为作斗争。
    中国工会应以爱国主义和共产主义的精神教育广大工人群众，经常地向工人群众进行国家利益和个人利益、长远利益和目前利益相一致的教育。为提高工人群众的政治、文化、技术水平而努力。中国工会应充分发扬国际主义的精神，积极参加国际工人运动，为国际工人运动的团结统一而斗争，为保卫远东和世界的持久和平而斗争。
    第二、关于工会会员问题
    第六次全国劳动大会所通过的章程第三条规定：“本会以团体会员为基础，中国境内之职工团体，凡赞成本会章程者，不分产业工会、职业工会、地方工会均得加入本会为会员……”在当时这样规定是正确的。因为当时在国民党统治区域还有各种职工团体存在，还不可能采用今天的组织形式。当时为了统一全国工人阶级的力量，只能采取以团体会员为基础的办法。但现在的情况改变了。随着人民革命的胜利和国家的统一，中国工会已经不是某些局部工人的不同组织的联盟，而是全国工人阶级统一的群众组织了。因此，过去“以团体会员为基础”的规定就必须加以修改。
    章程草案规定：“凡以工资收入为自己生活资料之全部或主要来源的体力劳动者与脑力劳动者，承认本章程，均得加入工会为会员。”对于这一规定，有以下两点说明：
    一、一切被人民政府剥夺政治权利的人，都是不能允许他们加入工会的。因为这些人的言论、集会、结社等政治权利都被剥夺了，他们自然就没有加入工会的权利了。他们中间的某些人在过去是剥削和压迫劳动人民的，某些人曾是背叛祖国的反革命分子，某些人是违犯了国家法令被判处徒刑的分子。
    二、章程草案规定：“凡以工资收入为自己生活资料之全部或主要来源的体力劳动者与脑力劳动者，承认本章程，均得加入工会为会员。”这就是说，所有工人不分民族、性别和宗教信仰，凡具备章程草案第一条所规定之条件者，都能加入工会为会员。这就是说，凡不是以工资收入、而是以其他收入为自己生活资料之全部或主要来源的体力劳动者（例如农民和小手工业者）与脑力劳动者（例如某些脑力劳动的自由职业者），都不应加入工会为会员。过去在某些地区，对于工人入会问题曾发生过两种不正确的倾向：第一种是关门主义的倾向。有些人不适当地把工会会员条件提得过高，增加许多不应有的限制，使很多工人不能加入工会。例如对思想意识落后的工人不许加入工会，而要学习积极、有工作能力、有文化程度的工人，甚至要写自传，举行宣誓、入会仪式，并经农民协会证明，县总工会批准等办法才能加入工会。这些作法都是错误的。这是不懂得工会的基本作用之一就是教育工人，正是要把这些不很觉悟的工人吸收到工会组织中来，才能更好地教育他们，提高他们的阶级觉悟。第二种是形式主义的倾向。这就是有些人只追求工会会员的数字，以至把非工人阶级的成份，例如小手工业者、自由职业者也拉入工会。这种作法也是错误的。
    第三、关于会员的权利和义务问题
    章程草案规定，每一个工会会员都有如下的权利：第一，有选举权与被选举权。第二，有向工会组织提出改进工作的意见与建议之权。第三，在工会的会议上或刊物上，有批评工会任何工作人员之权。第四，有享受工会所举办之各种集体的文化、福利事业之优先权。我们认为在章程草案中对会员权利的这些规定是非常必要的。
    为什么要规定工会会员的权利呢？因为：
    第一，只有明确地规定了并保障了工会会员的权利，才能保障工会的民主生活和民主制度。各级工会组织，从中华全国总工会执行委员会到每一个基层委员会，都应该是由各级工会组织的会员代表大会或全体会员大会民主选举产生的；而参加各级代表大会的代表，也都应该是由会员自下而上地民主选举产生的。如果不规定会员有选举权与被选举权，工会就不可能在民主集中制的基础上建立起来，成为广大工人群众自己的组织。
    第二，只有明确地规定了并保障了工会会员的权利，才能使工会工作真正建立在群众的基础上，在广大工人群众的积极参加和支持下得到不断的改进和加强。工会既然是工人阶级的群众组织，工会工作当然是群众工作，如果不规定每一个工会会员有向工会组织提出改进工作的意见与建议之权，就无法发挥会员群众参加工会工作的积极性，无法吸收群众的意见和建议，并无法在群众的监督下来做好工会工作。
    第三，只有明确地规定了并保障了工会会员的权利，才能保证工会内部批评和自我批评的开展，特别是自下而上的批评的开展，并保证工会领导的正确。任何拒绝批评的行为，都是破坏工会民主生活的原则的，我们必须经常注意与这种压制批评、破坏工会民主生活的行为作斗争。
    第四，只有明确地规定了并保障了工会会员不但在民主生活和民主制度上，而且在享受工会所举办的各种集体的文化、福利事业上的权利，才能使会员与非会员有所区别，才能使会员感到自己成为工会会员的光荣和责任，使他们积极地关心工会工作，对于应该参加而尚未参加工会的非会员也是一种教育，鼓励他们也积极地参加到工会组织中来。
    工会的各级组织都应该尊重每个工会会员的这些权利，不得侵犯。一切侵犯工会会员权利的行为都是违反工会章程的行为。工会的各级组织都应该向每一个工会会员经常进行关于会员权利的教育，使每一个工会会员都懂得自己有这些权利，并懂得运用这些权利的重要。
    章程草案规定，每一个工会会员都有如下的义务：第一，遵守国家法令与劳动纪律。第二，爱护公共财产。第三，努力学习政治、技术、文化，提高自己的阶级觉悟和工作能力。第四，遵守工会章程和决议，按时缴纳会费。章程草案对会员义务的这些规定，是非常重要的，而且是非常必要的。
    为什么要规定会员的这些义务呢？因为：
    第一，中国工人阶级已经是我国人民民主政权的领导阶级了。所以每一个职工应该懂得国家政权既然是自己的，就应当爱护并巩固这个政权，就要自觉地遵守人民政府的政策法令和劳动纪律。对于那些破坏政府法令和劳动纪律的人，应进行斗争。
    第二，要爱护公共财产。因为公共财产是为工人阶级和全国人民所有的社会主义的财产，它是我国工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会以及改善全体劳动者的物质生活和文化生活的物质基础。所以公共财产是神圣不可侵犯的。每一个会员都应当爱护它，并与那些贪污浪费以及破坏公共财产、不关心不爱护公共财产的现象作坚决的斗争。
    第三，我们要胜利地担负起国家建设的任务，每个会员就必须努力学习政治、技术和文化，提高自己的阶级觉悟和工作能力。否则，就很难担负起国家建设的任务。因此，每一个会员都应当努力学习，特别是要向苏联学习。
    第四，要胜利地实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会，就需要有一个坚强的有战斗力的工会组织，因此，加强工会组织的建设，是全体会员的共同责任。而加强工会建设的重要条件，就是每个会员都要遵守工会章程和决议，并按时缴纳会费。
    总之，只要每个会员都能很好地履行这些义务，工会组织的战斗力量将会进一步提高。因此，工会各级组织应把章程草案中所规定的会员义务，经常地向会员进行教育，这样，会员的阶级觉悟和主人翁的责任感就一定会提高，工会组织的战斗力就一定会加强，从而也就会有力地推动生产的发展。
    第四、关于工会的组织原则与组织机构问题
    一、工会是在民主集中制的基础上建立起来的
    章程草案规定：工会是在民主集中制的基础上建立起来的。其基本制度为：（一）各级工会领导机关，均必须自下而上地由会员民主选举产生，并定期向会员报告工作。（二）各级工会组织，均必须按照工会章程及组织决议进行工作。（三）各级工会的决议，须有出席会议者过半数之赞成方能通过。（四）下级工会组织服从上级工会组织。
    我们有些工会组织长期不召开会员大会或代表大会，向他们报告工作和经费开支情况，也不按期进行选举，不能展开批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，造成工会组织脱离群众，得不到自下而上的监督。这样就滋长了工会组织中的官僚主义、命令主义与违法乱纪的现象。经过“三反”、“五反”运动后，很多工会组织进行了整顿，但正常的民主生活制度和经常的批评与自我批评还很缺乏。最近我们曾接到不少工人群众的来信，揭露工会干部的缺点，这与领导上的官僚主义是分不开的。因此，工会各级组织必须克服官僚主义、文牍主义的作风。毛主席教导我们：“一切工作，如果仅仅提出任务而不注意实行时候的工作方法，不反对官僚主义的工作方法而采取实际的具体的工作方法，不抛弃命令主义的工作方法而采取耐心说服的工作方法，那末，什么任务也是不能实现的。”
    工会各级组织必须遵照工会章程所规定的定期向会员报告工作和工会经费开支情况，建立工会的正常民主生活制度与经常的批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，把工会组织放在广大工人群众监督之下。只有如此，工会才能得到广大工人群众的支持，才能密切工会与广大工人群众的联系，充分发挥工人群众的积极性来完成并超额完成国家的生产任务。也只有如此，才能在自觉的基础上加强工人群众的组织性和纪律性。
    二、工会是按照产业原则建立起来的
    按照产业原则组织工会，对保证国家生产计划的执行，解决工人有关生产、工资、劳动保护、劳动保险等问题，都有重大的意义。所谓按照产业的原则建立工会组织，就是：（一）将同一企业、机关等单位的工会会员组织在同一产业工会的基层组织中；而不是将同一企业、机关等单位中的工会会员，按照不同职业的原则来组织的。如果将同一企业、机关等单位中的工会会员，按照其职业分成若干不同的组织，则既不利于搞好生产，也不利于工人阶级内部的团结。（二）在全国范围内将国民经济同一工业部门中的工会会员组织在一个全国性的产业工会组织中，以便按照各产业部门的特点和国家建设的需要，保证完成与超额完成国家的生产计划，并在此基础上对工人阶级进行统一集中的教育和解决有关劳动条件与生活福利等问题。有计划、有重点地加强产业工会的工作，是在国家进行有计划经济建设时所必需的。（三）工会的地方组织，在可能条件下同样应按照产业的原则建立起来。各级地方工会联合会，是各该地方的产业工会组织和地方工会组织的联合领导机关。地方工会组织在过去工会组织建设中是起过重大作用的，在目前和今后相当长的时期内，对产业工会的建立和健全，对全国工会工作的开展仍然是有重大作用的。在有重点地加强产业工会工作的同时，不应该忽视地方工会组织的作用。
    三、章程草案规定：“中华全国总工会执行委员会的全体会议选举主席团和书记处。”全国总工会过去由常务委员会领导日常工作，现在为了更集中地加强全国总工会的工作及对各产业工会的领导，所以设立主席团和书记处。
    全国总工会的主席团，在执行委员会闭会期间，是全国工会的领导机关，执行全国代表大会和执行委员会的决议，并领导全国工会的一切工作。
    全国总工会的书记处，在主席团领导下处理全国工会的日常工作。
    章程草案规定：有的产业工会设主席团领导日常工作，有的产业工会仍设常务委员会领导日常工作。其原因是：有些产业比较集中，工会组织比较健全，采取主席团的组织形式更为适宜；而有的产业工会组织尚不够健全，故仍设常务委员会领导日常工作。
    四、章程草案规定：工会各级组织设立经费审查委员会，工会各级组织的财务报告，必须有经费审查委员会主席签名盖章，方为有效。其目的是充分发扬民主，使工会会员监督工会经费的正确使用。
    五、章程草案规定：地方工会组织的名称，改为地方工会联合会。其原因是：过去各级地方工会组织均称总工会，那样，总工会就太多了。实际上地方工会是各产业工会组织和地方工会组织的联合领导机关，故改称为工会联合会。省工会联合会，今后除加强对产业工会的领导外，还要加强对县、镇工会的领导。县、镇工会的工作，除少数产业外，应加强手工业工人工作。
    第五、关于工会基层组织问题
    一、工会基层组织是工会的基础
    工会基层组织是工会的基础，它直接接近群众，联系群众，工会的一切工作都要通过基层组织去进行，工会基层组织建立的好坏是决定整个工会工作的关键；因此我们必须集中力量做好基层工作。
    章程草案规定：工会基层组织，是由同一企业或机关中的工会会员组成的。这样按照产业原则建立起来的工会基层组织，对加强工人、职员的团结，保证提高劳动生产率与改善工人、职员的物质生活和文化生活，都有决定性的意义。
    但是由于中国经济情况复杂，发展也不平衡，私人小企业单位还占相当大的比重，因此工会基层组织建立在什么地方有明确规定的必要。综合性的大企业，如鞍山、抚顺等地的厂矿，可按工场、井口建立工会基层委员会。其次，如建筑业，基本上可按建筑材料厂与工地建立基层委员会，但由于建筑工人流动性大，公司一级工会组织仍应保留。单一的大工厂，如某些大的纺织厂、电车公司等，可建立分场一级的基层委员会，但必须经过上级工会的批准。做某一零件的加工工厂以及小工厂，在二十五人以上者得建立工会基层委员会；不足二十五人者，选举组织员一人；不足三人者，参加附近相近的产业或行业的工会组织或成立联合小组。
    二、关于车间委员会的建立问题
    凡大的工厂大的车间应不分班次，不分工种建立车间委员会。这样对生产有利，并便于对工人进行教育及解决生活问题。小工厂和小车间就不必建立车间委员会，可成立小组。因为人数很少的单位，层次多了，就会影响工作不深入，而且建立车间委员会也无事可做。
    三、关于小组的建立问题，章程草案规定：应按生产工作班或工作单位建立工会小组，而不应当按人数、性别、自由组合等方法建立。工会小组是工人群众日常活动的单位，工会小组的强弱对基层工作是有重要意义的。这种按生产、按班次建立的工会小组，既便利于生产，又便利于对工人进行教育和解决工人的生活问题。
    四、关于基层委员会和车间委员会的各种工作委员会的建立问题，章程草案规定：工会基层委员会和车间（或部门）委员会得按工作需要建立各种工作委员会。章程上作这样的规定之所以必要，是因为在建立工作委员会时一定要根据各厂各车间工会工作的需要与可能来建立。例如较大的工厂、车间或工作较好的工厂、车间常设有生产、工资（合理化建议可包括在内）、文教、劳动保险、劳动保护、互助及居住生活等工作委员会。规模较小的工厂或车间不必设立工作委员会，由各个委员分工领导日常工作。
    第六、关于手工业工会联合会的组织问题
    章程草案规定：“手工业工会联合会的组织办法另订之”。其原因是：手工业不仅与近代的产业不同，而且各地情况也不同，故不能采用产业工人的组织形式与方法去组织手工业工人。手工业工人如何组织，应另作规定。我建议大会授权下届执行委员会研究和处理这个问题。
    关于修改章程的报告我所讲的就是这些。
    总之，加强工会各级组织，加强产业工会，加强工会基层组织的工作，发扬工会民主和健全工会的制度，是当前工会建设的重要任务。只有胜利地完成这些任务，我们才能更加巩固和提高工人阶级的战斗力量，才能胜利地完成国家五年计划的光荣任务。
