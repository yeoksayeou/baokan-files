The Metallurgical Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, after inspecting that its subordinate enterprises had not fully completed the April production plan and that the balance in production was very poor, instructed its subordinate factories and mines on May 12th to promptly shift to establishing and improving planning management systems on the basis of mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, so as to ensure the completion of the annual production plan.

In April, the national metallurgical industry, except for exceeding the steel ingot plan by 4%, did not complete the plans for the remaining products. Among them, iron ore completed 99.8%, coke completed 99.6%, pig iron completed 96.6%, and steel completed 93.8%. From the perspective of various enterprises, Yangquan Iron Mine, Shijiazhuang Coke Plant, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 3, Southwest Plant 104 and 102, and other eight units have fully completed the main product plans. Southwest Plant 101, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Fushun Steel Plant, Dalian Steel Plant, Longyan, Liguo, Jinling Iron Mines, Tianjin Steel Plant and other eight units did not complete most of the main product plans, among which Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and Dalian Steel Plant were the worst. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed only 72.2% of pig iron. Dalian Steel Plant completed only 88.2% of steel ingots and only 48.3% of steel. The balance and rhythm of completing the plan were also not good. For example, if the output in the first ten days is one hundred, then: the output of steel ingots in the middle ten days of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 is 80.5, and the last ten days is 106; steel in the middle ten days is 147.9, and the last ten days is 194.3; pig iron production in Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is 117 in the middle ten days, and 76.4 in the last ten days; a blast furnace in Longyan Iron Mine only completed the daily production plan for six days.

A major reason for the poor production situation in April was that after rushing to complete the first quarter's tasks in March, the leading cadres of individual factories and mines were satisfied with this achievement and failed to pay attention and take timely measures to prevent accidents in order to ensure safe production. For example, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had three hanging furnace accidents in April. At the beginning of the month, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant discovered that one tooth of the reduction gear of the medium-sized rolling mill was broken and twelve teeth were cracked, and production was suspended for seven days; on the 25th, it was discovered that thirteen teeth had cracks and limited production was implemented. Secondly, the quality of repairs was poor, and there were too many unplanned equipment repairs. The planned repair time for the open hearth furnace in Daye Plant was fifteen days, but because the pre-inspection was not thorough, it was discovered during the repair that the supporting parts had to be replaced, so it was extended by seven days. Due to the poor quality of repairs, the forging steel equipment of the factories and mines under Benxi Iron and Steel Company had several mechanical accidents. Too many unplanned equipment repairs also showed that the foundation of the current planning management and responsibility system of the factories and mines is weak.

The second quarter's order meeting was held late, and it ended in mid-April, which made the production goals of the factories and mines in April not clear enough, affecting the organization of production. This is also an objective reason that affects the failure to complete the task.

In order to gradually and thoroughly reverse this situation, and in accordance with the fact that the national metallurgical industry factories and mines will end the work of mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, the Metallurgical Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry specifically instructed its subordinate factories and mines on May 12th to promptly shift to establishing and improving planning management systems on the basis of discussing the plan. In particular, strengthen operation planning and production scheduling. In terms of operation planning, factories and mines with a better foundation are required to make production instruction charts according to work shifts, and strive to complete the daily operation plan; factories and mines with a poorer foundation should complete the plan evenly by ten days or weeks to ensure the completion of the monthly plan.

The instruction emphasized: When establishing or improving operation planning and production scheduling, all factories and mines should first study the shortcomings in production organization revealed by the masses during the discussion of the plan, and find out the main factors that could not complete the task evenly in the past; and use these problems as the main content to organize mass discussions so that they can grasp the laws of production, put forward specific measures, and provide direction for establishing a responsibility system. At the same time, the formulation or revision of operation plans must be gradually promoted from point to surface, from simple to complex, and from major departments to secondary departments.

The instruction pointed out that production scheduling is an inseparable whole with operation planning. The scheduling organization should form a vertical system from the factory to the workshop; cadres who are familiar with production, have a strong sense of responsibility, and have a certain organizational ability should be assigned to scheduling work, and their responsibilities should be clearly defined and given the necessary work authority. The factory leaders must strengthen the flexibility, concentration and unity of production command and dispatch, and strengthen the connection between workshops, between work sections, and between functional institutions and workshops, so as to improve labor efficiency and solve the main problems in production in a timely manner.

    中央钢铁工业管理局指示所属厂矿
    及时建立与健全计划管理制度
    【本报讯】重工业部钢铁工业管理局，检查了所属企业还没有全面完成四月份生产计划，以及生产中的均衡性很差，于五月十二日指示所属厂矿，在发动群众讨论计划的基础上，及时地转入建立与健全计划管理制度，以保证全年生产计划的完成。
    四月份，全国钢铁工业，除超过百分之四完成钢锭的计划以外，其余产品都没有完成计划，其中铁矿完成百分之九十九点八，焦炭完成百分之九十九点六，生铁完成百分之九十六点六，钢材完成百分之九十三点八。从各企业来看，全部完成主要产品计划的有阳泉铁矿，石家庄焦厂，上海炼钢一厂、三厂，西南一○四、一○二厂等八个单位。大部分主要产品都没有完成计划的有西南一○一厂，石景山钢铁厂，抚顺钢厂，大连钢厂，龙烟、利国、金岭铁矿，天津钢厂等八个单位，其中以石景山钢铁厂与大连钢厂为最差。石景山钢铁厂的生铁仅完成百分之七十二点二。大连钢厂的钢锭只完成百分之八十八点二，钢材只完成百分之四十八点三。完成计划的均衡性和节奏性也不好。如以上旬产量为一百，则：上海炼钢三厂中旬的钢锭产量为八十点五，下旬为一百零六；钢材中旬为一百四十七点九，下旬为一百九十四点三；石景山钢铁厂生铁产量中旬为一百一十七，下旬为七十六点四；龙烟铁矿某高炉仅有六天完成日生产计划。
    四月份生产情况不好的一个主要原因：是三月份突击完成第一季任务以后，个别的厂矿的领导干部满足于这一成绩，未能及时地注意并采取适时的防止事故措施，以保障安全生产。如石景山钢铁厂在四月内连续发生三次高炉挂料事故。太原钢铁厂在月初发现中型轧钢机的减速齿轮折断一齿，裂十二齿，停工七日；至二十五日又发现有十三个齿有裂纹后实行限产。其次，检修质量不好，非计划的设备检修过多。大冶厂平炉原计划检修时间为十五天，但因事前检查不周密，至修理时又发现支撑部分必须更换，因此延长了七天。本溪钢铁公司所属厂矿锻钢设备因检修质量不好，几次发生机械事故。非计划的设备检修过多，也说明了各厂矿目前的计划管理和责任制的基础是薄弱的。
    第二季订货会议开得较晚，四月中旬才结束，致使各厂矿四月份的生产目标不够明确，影响生产的组织工作。这也是影响任务不能完成的一个客观原因。
    为了逐步而彻底地扭转这种情况，同时根据目前全国钢铁工业厂矿将结束发动群众讨论计划工作，中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局特于五月十二日指示所属厂矿，在讨论计划的基础上，及时地转入建立与健全计划管理制度。特别是加强作业计划及生产调度工作。作业计划方面，要求基础较好的厂矿作到按工作班制订生产指示图，争取完成日作业计划；较差的厂矿按旬或周均衡地完成计划，以保证月计划的完成。
    指示强调指出：各厂矿在建立或健全作业计划及生产调度工作时，首先应研究群众在讨论计划时所揭发的生产组织中的缺点，找出过去不能均衡完成任务的主要因素；并将这些问题作为主要内容，组织群众讨论，以便他们掌握生产规律，提出具体措施，给建立责任制提出方向。同时制订或修订作业计划，必须由点到面、由简到繁、由主要部门到次要部门逐步推行。
    指示指出，生产调度工作与作业计划是不可分割的一个整体，调度机构从厂到车间应成垂直系统；应配备熟悉生产、责任心强同时又有一定组织能力的干部担任调度工作，并明确规定其职责范围，赋予应有的工作权限。厂领导方面则必须加强生产指挥调度的灵活性、集中性与统一性，加强车间与车间、工段与工段、职能机构与车间之间的联系，以提高劳动效率，及时解决生产中的主要问题。
