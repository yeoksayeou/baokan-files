After Watching the Performance of the Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble
Wu Xiaobang

The famous Polish People's Republic Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, which we have been looking forward to for a long time, has finally met the Chinese audience on the stage of our capital. We have seen the wonderful performances of all the young members of the song and dance ensemble, and we are all intoxicated by their beautiful dances and songs.

Every dance program has been carefully selected by Comrade Yevgeny Bapalinzky, who has organized the folk dances of the northern forest area and southern grassland area of Mazovia, Poland, concisely and meticulously. The dancers are also young, and their movements reveal the characteristics of authentic, simple, and pleasant folk dances. Under the efforts of Comrades Segietinsky and Bapalinzky, the song and dance ensemble collected folk music and dance styles and created very beautiful dances, such as the southern "Mazurka" dance and the northern "Tramblanka" dance. In the adaptation work, because they maintained the characteristics of folk dances, and at the same time carefully processed them, the ancient Polish dance "Tramblanka" and the enthusiastic and unrestrained "Obertas" both have magnificent and charming charm. Other dance programs such as "Olen Deer", "Zuraw", and "Povurnyak" have also been organized into beautiful pictures in the adaptation work, deeply touching the hearts of the audience. These programs are completely consistent with the content of their folk songs, reflecting the new life of young men and women after liberation from the iron hooves of landlords and fascists, and expressing the Polish people's strong self-confidence and pride in their motherland. There are no affected movements in their dances, and the appearance of each actor appears so young, beautiful, and pure. The accompanying music is also processed on the basis of the original dance music of folk dances, so it also preserves the characteristics of Polish people's music and is completely coordinated with the movements of the dance.

The singing programs of the song and dance ensemble are also beautiful. It uses simple, natural, authentic, and diverse tunes to reflect the noble qualities of the Polish people's love for labor and love for life.

This performance of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble in China has given great help to our Chinese music and dance workers. What particularly attracts our attention is the outstanding contribution of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble to the song and dance art of the Polish people. They absorb outstanding young people from the vast folk areas into the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, let them learn the song and dance forms that their own people love most, and they adopt various teaching methods to cultivate every young song and dance worker, so that they are familiar with the life and history of their own people and face up to the cultural and artistic traditions of their own country. In order to make the dance perform better, they also learn the basic training of classical dance (ballet technique), but it is limited to leg training, and hand training is not included in the course. Mazowsze's training method is precisely to ensure the development of the characteristics of Polish folk dance. This point is very worthy of deep study by our Chinese dance workers.

The costume design of Comrade Mila Ziminskaia is also worth learning. The colors and styles of the costumes are very harmonious, so the movements of the dancers on the stage are more lively. Mila Ziminskaia's choice of colors and patterns is closely related to the forms most loved by the Polish people in historical and real life. She is by no means designed out of thin air, but boldly created on the basis of today's people's lives. His efforts earned her a national prize.

Let us join hands with all the comrades of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble headed by Comrade Andrei Pannufnik and work hard to develop the song and dance cause of the Chinese and Polish people.

    波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团演出观后
    吴晓邦
    我们盼望已久的著名的波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团终于在我国首都的舞台上与中国观众见面了。我们看到了歌舞团全体年青团员们的精彩演出，我们大家都陶醉在他们美丽的舞蹈和歌声中了。
    每一个舞蹈节目，都是经过叶夫格尼·巴帕林斯基同志所精选过的，他把波兰玛佐维亚北部森林地带和南部草原地带的民间舞蹈简洁和精细地组织起来。舞蹈演员也都是年青的，从他们的动作中流露出真实、质朴、和愉快情调的民间舞蹈的特征来。歌舞团在塞格廷斯基和巴帕林斯基同志的努力下，搜集民间音乐和舞蹈的样式，创造出非常美丽的舞蹈，如南部的“玛茹卡”舞蹈和北部的“特兰勃良卡”舞。在改编工作中，由于他们保持了民间舞蹈的特点，同时又细致地加工，因而使古代的波兰舞“特兰勃良卡”与热情豪放的“奥别列克”都有了壮丽迷人的魅力。其它如“奥连捷尔”，“茹拉夫”和“波伏尔湼克”等舞蹈节目，也都在改编工作中把它们组织在优美的画面内，深深地打动了观众的心。这些节目完全和他们的民歌内容一致，反映了青年男女们从地主和法西斯铁蹄下解放后的新生活，表示了波兰人民坚强的自信心，对自己祖国的骄傲。他们的舞蹈里没有矫揉做作的动作，而每一个演员的出现都显得那样年青、美丽和纯洁。伴奏的音乐也是在民间舞蹈的原有舞曲上加工的，因而也保存了波兰人民音乐的特点，跟舞蹈的动作完全协调。
    歌舞团的歌唱节目也是优美的。它用朴素、自然、真实以及多样化的曲调，反映了波兰人民热爱劳动、热爱生活的崇高品质。
    这次玛佐夫舍歌舞团在中国的演出，给我们中国的音乐舞蹈工作者很大的帮助，尤其引我们注意的是玛佐夫舍歌舞团对于波兰人民歌舞艺术的卓越贡献。他们从广大的民间去吸收优秀的青年到玛佐夫舍歌舞团来，让他们学习自己祖国人民所最爱好的歌舞形式，他们采取各种教学方法，来培养每一个年青歌舞工作者，使他们熟知自己祖国人民的生活和历史，正视自己祖国的文化艺术传统。为了使舞蹈表现得更好，他们也学习古典舞的基本训练（芭蕾舞技术），可是只限于腿部训练，手部训练则不包括在课程之内。玛佐夫舍这种训练方法正是为了保证波兰民间舞蹈特点的发挥。这一点是很值得我们中国舞蹈工作者深深研究的。
    米拉·齐明斯卡娅同志的服装设计，也是值得学习的。服装的色彩和式样都显得很调和，因此舞蹈演员们在台上的动作更显得生气勃勃。米拉·齐明斯卡娅对于色彩和图案的选择是和波兰人民在历史的和现实的生活中最喜爱的形式密切联系的。她决不是凭空设计的，而是从今天人民生活的基础上大胆地创造出来的。他的努力使她获得国家奖金。
    让我们和以安得烈·潘努夫尼克同志为首的玛佐夫舍歌舞团的全体同志们紧紧拉起手来，为发展中波两国人民歌舞事业而努力。
