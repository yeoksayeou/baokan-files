Excessively Refining Rice and Flour Processing Wastes Grain and Reduces Nutritional Value
Deputy Director of the Office of the Processing Administration Bureau, Central Ministry of Food, Zhao Luqing

Since liberation, due to the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, people's lives have gradually improved, and people's demands for the quality of food grains have also increased. Families who used to eat bran and wild herbs are now eating grain! Families who used to eat coarse grains are now eating rice and white flour. This is of course a good phenomenon. But at the same time, many people have developed a psychology of demanding excessive refinement of rice and white flour. Grain management departments cater to this demand and blindly improve processing precision in order to obtain more profit. Those who demand excessively refined rice and flour completely disregard nutritional value and, even more, fail to see the enormous waste of national grain caused by over-processing. The Wuhan Grain Company originally produced 90 jin of medium-grade rice from every 100 jin of brown rice. However, after increasing the processing precision by increasing the number of machine milling passes, the amount of broken and decapitated grains increased, and the processing loss increased. Every 100 jin of brown rice only yielded 75 jin of Grade 1 rice, plus 10 jin of medium broken rice, and 2 jin of fine broken rice, with a net loss of 3 jin of rice. Fine broken rice can only be used as feed as a byproduct. Although medium broken rice can be used as food grain, it produces less cooked rice and is less filling compared to whole rice. Ten jin of medium broken rice is probably only equivalent to eight jin of good rice. If a total of five jin of rice is lost for every 100 jin of grain in order to improve processing precision, then based on the Wuhan Grain Company processing 100 million jin of Grade 1 rice in 1952, a total of 5 million jin of rice was lost. If the whole country processes 8 billion jin of Grade 1 rice annually, then a total of about 400 million jin of rice is lost, which, calculated at one jin of rice per person per day, could meet the needs of the entire population of Guizhou Province for one month. Based on the total annual rice sales in Beijing, it could supply the city for two years. The waste of flour is also alarming when wheat is processed too finely. For example, the former Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau, in order to obtain refined and white finished products and facilitate supply, disregarded the wheat test weight standard (145 jin per shi) for processing Grade 81 standard flour stipulated by the former East China Grain Bureau, and revised the wheat test weight standard to 147 jin per shi, which is 2 jin higher than the original regulation. This reduced the flour yield of wheat during processing, resulting in about 1.5 jin less flour produced per 100 jin of wheat. If the Jinan Grain Bureau processes 100 million jin of wheat annually, about 1.5 million jin of flour will be lost. At 1.5 jin of flour consumed per person per day, this lost flour could feed one million people for one day. Assuming that 7 billion jin of wheat is processed annually across the country, then processing according to the Shandong Grain Bureau's raised standards will result in a loss of 105 million jin of flour. At 1.5 jin per person per day, this could feed 70 million people for one day, or 191,780 people for one year.

In terms of nutrition, according to the analysis report of the Nutrition Department of the Central Institute of Hygiene, every 100 grams of brown rice contains 0.3 to 0.5 milligrams of Vitamin B1 (1 jin equals 500 grams, 1 gram equals 1000 milligrams), while white rice with excessively high precision and without germ and bran contains only 0.05 milligrams of Vitamin B1 per 100 grams. This proves that the higher the processing precision of rice, the lower its nutritional content. Therefore, I suggest that leading comrades in grain departments in various regions should re-stipulate standards and strictly implement them in controlling grain processing work for product specifications. We should advocate saving grain and oppose waste and disregard for nutritional content, which affects human health. Regarding the refined and white standard of flour, I believe that the specifications of the "Fuqiang" brand Grade 1 flour, "Jianshe" brand Grade 2 flour, and "Shengchan" brand Grade 3 flour, uniformly stipulated by the former Grain Corporation, can be used as the standard. The processing of flour in various regions should not exceed the standard specifications of Grade 1 flour at the most refined. As for the precision standard of rice, japonica rice and indica rice should be classified into three grades according to their precision and cleanliness. The classification of precision grades can refer to the appearance of rice, the degree of bran and germ retention as the basis, and cleanliness can refer to broken rice and impurity content as the basis. We should also adhere to the spirit of determining quantity based on quality, and under the principle of maintaining consistent national rice specifications, we must achieve more rice from good grain, less rice from inferior grain, good rice from good processing, and inferior rice from inferior processing. The processing precision of rice in various regions should not exceed the standard specifications of Grade 1 rice at the most.

In order to increase the nutritional content of rice and flour and save grain, it is recommended that various regions focus on processing "Jianshe" brand Grade 2 flour and medium-grade rice in the future. As for flour bleaching and the use of polishing powder during rice milling, they affect human health and only increase waste, so their use should be strictly prohibited.

At the same time, we suggest that revolutionary cadres, workers, and People's Liberation Army comrades throughout the country should not pursue eating special-grade flour or Grade 1 rice, because over-refined grain processing not only wastes a large amount of national grain, but also does not provide sufficient nutritional content. We also hope that everyone will eat whatever grain is produced locally and whatever grain is available locally as much as possible in order to reduce the difficulties in national grain allocation and processing. This will be of great benefit to saving national grain and funds. This will also be beneficial to strengthening our country's large-scale economic construction.

    过分提高米面加工精度会浪费粮食和减低营养价值
    中央粮食部加工管理局办公室副主任  赵鲁青
    解放以来，由于工农业生产的恢复和发展，人民生活逐渐改善，人们对食粮品质的要求日益提高了。原来吃糠咽菜的人家，现在换成粮食了！原来吃杂粮的人家，现在吃大米、白面了，这当然是一种好现象。但与此同时，许多人产生了一种对大米、白面要求过分精白的心理，粮食经营部门迎合这种要求，盲目提高加工精度，以便获得较多的利润。这些要求米面过分精白的人，完全没有考虑到营养价值，更看不见由于粮食加工过精，使国家粮食遭受的巨大浪费。武汉市粮食公司，原来每百斤糙米出九十斤中等米，但提高加工精度后，因增加机碾道数，碎米断头提高，加工损耗增大，每百斤糙米只出一号米七十五斤，另有中碎米十斤，细碎米二斤，净耗大米三斤。细碎米只能当副产品作为饲料，中碎米虽可作为食粮，但与大米比较起来，出饭量少，且不耐饥。十斤中碎米恐怕只能抵八斤好米。若以每百斤粮食为了提高加工精度，总共损耗五斤米。以武汉市粮食公司一九五二年加工一号大米一亿斤计，共损失大米五百万斤；若以全国全年加工一号大米八十亿斤计，则共损失大米约四亿斤，按每人每日食米一斤计算，可满足贵州省全省人口一月之需。若以北京市全年大米销售总量估计，可以供应二年。小麦加工过精，对面粉的浪费也是很惊人的。例如前山东省粮食局为求成品精白，供应便利，竟不顾前华东区粮食局规定的加工八一通粉的小麦容重标准（每市石一四五市斤），将小麦容重标准改定为每市石一四七市斤，较原规定高出二斤，这样在加工中就减低了小麦出粉率，使每百斤小麦约少产面粉一斤半。若以济南市粮食局全年加工小麦一亿斤计算，约损失面粉一百五十万斤，以每人每日食用面粉一斤半计，这损失的面粉可供一百万人吃一天。假设全年全国各地加工的小麦为七十亿斤，那么，按山东粮食局提高了的标准加工，将损失面粉一亿零五百万斤，一人一天一斤半，就可供七千万人吃一天，可供十九万一千七百八十人吃一年。
    在营养方面，根据中央卫生研究院营养学系分析报告，每百克糙米内所含一号乙种维生素为○·三至○·五毫克（一市斤等于五百克，一克等于一千毫克），而精度过高不带胚芽与米皮的白米每百克内仅含有一号乙种维生素○·○五毫克。由此可以证明：米的加工精度愈高，其所含营养成份反而愈低。因此我建议各地粮食部门领导同志，在掌握粮食加工工作中，对于产品规格，应重新规定标准，严格执行。应该提倡节约粮食，反对浪费和忽视营养成份，影响人身健康的现象。关于面粉的精白标准，我认为可依前粮食公司统一规定的富强牌一等粉，建设牌二等粉，生产牌三等粉的规格作为标准，各地面粉加工，最精不得超过一等粉的标准规格。至于大米的精度标准，粳米、籼米，应根据其精度与整洁度确定规格，分为三等，规格精度的划分可参照大米外形，留皮、留胚等不同程度，作为依据，整洁度可参照碎米及含杂量作为依据，并应掌握着以质定量的精神，在保持全国大米规格一致的原则下，要作到好粮多出米，次粮少出米，好粮打好米，次粮打次米；各地大米加工精度，最高不得超过一等米的标准规格。
    为了增加米面营养成份和节约粮食，建议各地以建设牌二等面粉与中等米作为今后加工的重点方向；至于面粉漂白，与碾米时使用光粉，因影响人身健康，徒增浪费，应严格禁止使用。
    同时，我们建议全国的革命干部，全国的职工同志和解放军同志们，不要追求吃特等面粉或一号米，因为粮食加工过于精细，不仅大量浪费国家的粮食，而且营养成份并不充足。我们也希望大家，当地出产什么粮食，当地有什么粮食，就尽量吃什么粮食，以减少国家在粮食调运和加工当中的困难。这样对于节约国家粮食和资金是大有好处的。这对于加强我们国家大规模的经济建设也是有好处的。
