Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 21st Dispatch: The Italian parliamentary elections will be held on June 7th this year, and various parties are vigorously campaigning. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party are fielding separate candidates in the upcoming elections, but are maintaining close unified action in the campaign struggle. The Christian Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the Republican Party, and some local parties, such as the Sardinian Action Party and the South Tyrol People's Party (a party of German ethnic autonomists), have formed an electoral alliance and nominated joint candidates. In addition, the Monarchist Party, the neo-fascist "Italian Social Movement" party, and the newly formed anti-government independent political groups—the "National Democratic Alliance" and the "Movement for People's Unity"—are also participating in the election struggle.

The main guidelines followed by the Communist Party's campaign program are as follows: prevent the Christian Democratic Party's alliance from obtaining 50% of the votes, thus rendering the new electoral law ineffective; implement the nationalization of the largest industrial monopolies; implement comprehensive land reform, confiscate large estates, and distribute land to landless and poor peasants; all working people should enjoy free medical treatment and social welfare; implement a large-scale housing construction plan to reduce rents; stop all persecution of working people and their organizations; and establish a government that represents the peaceful aspirations of the Italian people and is able to establish good neighborly relations with all countries in the world and develop large-scale trade.

The Socialist Party's campaign program advocates fundamental reform of Italian government policy. In domestic affairs, the program calls for: respecting and abiding by the constitution and the provisions in the constitution concerning the political and social rights of working people; eliminating unemployment; raising the living standards of working people; implementing land reform; opposing the rule of monopoly capital; and carrying out extensive government construction work plans, etc. In foreign policy, the program calls for: defending peace; guaranteeing Italy's neutrality; and establishing friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, and promoting trade relations with these countries.

In the Christian Democratic Party's campaign group, the election campaigns of all parties have a common characteristic, which is that none of them have any definite political program. The Socio-Economic Committee of the Christian Democratic Party recently published a voluminous document outlining the "party's ultimate goals in the social field" and "goals in the economic and financial fields." However, even reactionary newspapers believe that this document is too "generalized" and "useless."

As the election campaign progresses, the differences between the Christian Democratic Party and its allied parties are becoming increasingly apparent. The Christian Democratic Party is making every effort to boast about the "achievements" it has made during its five years in power, while the leaders of the Social Democratic Party, in order to win the sympathy of voters, are criticizing the government, saying that it has done nothing, has not established social justice, or given the Italian economy a solid foundation. The Liberal Party is also accusing the Christian Democratic Party of trying to monopolize all important and minor positions in Italy in order to win over voters. The political group established for this election, the "People's Unity Movement," is conducting a struggle against the election "reform" law and for a progressive foreign and economic policy that does not depend on the United States.

### 在议会选举的竞选斗争中  意大利共产党和社会党保持统一行动

    在议会选举的竞选斗争中
    意大利共产党和社会党保持统一行动
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利议会选举将于今年六月七日举行，现在各党派都在大力地进行竞选。共产党和社会党在即将到来的选举中分头提出候选人，但在竞选斗争中保持着密切的统一行动。天主教民主党、社会民主党、自由党、共和党以及一些地方党派，如撒丁行动党和南蒂罗尔人民党（德意志民族自治主义者的党）组成了选举联盟，并提出了联合候选人。此外，保皇党、新法西斯主义的“意大利社会运动”党和新近组成的反对政府的独立政治集团——“全国民主联盟”和“争取人民团结运动”也都参加了竞选斗争。
    共产党的竞选纲领所遵循的主要方针如下：阻止天主教民主党的联盟得到百分之五十的选票，这样使新的选举法失去效力；实行最大工业垄断资本的国有化；实行全面土地改革，没收大庄园，把土地分配给无地农民及贫农；一切劳动人民得享有免费治疗和社会福利；实施大规模修建房屋计划，以减低房租；停止对劳动人民和他们的团体的一切迫害行为；成立一个代表意大利人民的和平愿望、并能够与世界各国建立良好的邻邦关系及发展大规模贸易的政府。
    社会党的竞选纲领主张根本改革意大利政府政策。在内政方面，纲领要求：尊重和遵守宪法及宪法中有关劳动人民的政治与社会权利的条款；消除失业现象；提高劳动人民生活水平；实行土地改革；反对垄断资本的统治；进行广泛的政府建设工作计划等。在外交政策方面，纲领号召：保卫和平；保证意大利的中立；与苏联、中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家建立友好关系和促进与这些国家的贸易关系。
    在天主教民主党竞选集团中，所有党派的竞选运动都有一个共同的特点，那就是它们都没有任何一定的政纲。天主教民主党社会经济委员会最近发表了一个浩繁的文告，说明“党在社会方面的最终目的”及在“经济与财政方面的目的”。但是甚至反动报纸也认为这个文告太“一般化”和“没有用处”。
    随着竞选运动的开展，天主教民主党与它的同盟党之间的分歧越来越明显。天主教民主党竭力自吹他们在当权五年中所获得的“成就”，而社会民主党领袖们为了想博得选民的同情，却抨击政府，说它没有做出半点事来，没有建立社会正义或使意大利经济有一个稳固的基础。自由党也同样为了获得选民，而指责天主教民主党想独霸意大利的所有重要和次要的职位。为这次选举而建立的政治团体
    “人民统一运动”进行着反对选举“改革”法和争取一个不依赖美国的进步的外交和经济政策的斗争。
