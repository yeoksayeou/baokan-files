Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st: Soviet workers are not only good at using new equipment, but also at using old equipment. The Ukrainian newspaper Pravda recently reported a vivid example of using old equipment.

　　The steel plant in Yenakiyevo city, Stalin Oblast, Ukraine, is a factory with a long history, and many of its machines have been in use for more than fifty years. However, the factory workers are still using this equipment, and with great efficiency. The workers in the rail and beam workshop of this factory have pledged to overproduce tens of thousands of tons of steel this year and bring production up to the level of 1955. This pledge is now being successfully implemented. In the first four months of this year, the workshop's workers overproduced several thousand tons of steel. The amount of steel rolled in the workshop has now reached the quota for the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that each rolling mill should roll 95.7 tons of steel ingots per hour by 1955. This target was already achieved in the first quarter of this year; some workers were able to roll 116.9 tons of steel ingots per hour. In order to consolidate their achievements, the workers in this workshop are continuing to tap their potential. They are adopting advanced production procedures, such as using different machines to roll different sizes of steel ingots, thereby increasing productivity by 5% to 6%. They have also made and installed their own conveyor belts, which allow products to be transported to the warehouse continuously and without obstruction, resulting in increased productivity. To make up for the shortcomings of the old soaking pits, they equipped them with two five-ton trolleys, laid light rails between the open-hearth furnaces and the soaking pits, and transported the steel ingots to the soaking pits while they were still hot, which increased the productivity of the soaking pits by about 10%. The achievements of this workshop are inseparable from the adoption of rationalization proposals. At the end of last year, advanced workers and technicians in the workshop put forward 75 rationalization proposals, and the workers added 96 more rationalization proposals during the discussion of these proposals. Based on these proposals, they formulated a plan to strive to reach the 1955 production level ahead of schedule. Now, all the workers in the workshop are working hard to achieve this goal.

    苏联工人充分利用旧有设备提高生产率
    【新华社莫斯科二十一日电】苏联工人不但善于利用新的设备，而且也善于利用旧的设备。乌克兰真理报最近报道了利用旧有设备的一个生动的事例。
    乌克兰斯大林州耶纳基耶沃城的钢铁厂，是一个历史悠久的工厂，许多机器已经用了五十多年。但是工厂职工仍然使用着这些设备，而且效率很高。这个工厂的钢轨钢梁车间的职工保证，要在今年超计划生产几万吨钢材，并使生产达到一九五五年的水平。现在，这个保证正在胜利地执行着。车间的职工在今年头四个月内超计划生产了好几千吨钢材。车间轧钢的数量现在已达到了第五个五年计划末期的定额。五年计划规定到一九五五年每一个轧钢机一小时应轧九十五点七吨钢锭。这个指标在今年第一季就已经达到了；有些工人一小时能轧一百十六点九吨钢锭。这个车间的职工们为了巩固既得的成绩，正在继续发掘潜在力量。他们采用先进的生产手续，使大小机器分别轧大小钢锭，因而提高了生产率百分之五到六。他们还自制和装置了输送带，使产品源源无阻地运到仓库，结果生产率也提高了。为了补救旧的均热炉的不足，他们配了两个载重五吨的电车，在平炉和均热炉之间铺了轻便铁轨，把钢锭趁着高热运到均热炉去，这样使均热炉的生产率提高了约百分之十。这个车间的成就是和采用合理化建议分不开的。去年年底，车间的先进工人和技术人员提出了七十五件合理化建议，工人们在讨论这些建议时又补充了九十六件合理化建议。他们就是根据这些建议，制订了争取提前达到一九五五年生产水平的计划。现在，车间的全体职工正为实现这个目标而奋斗着。
