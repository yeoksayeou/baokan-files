Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 5th: The London "Daily Worker" on May 1st condemned the domineering attitude of Harrison, the chief American representative at the Korean armistice talks, during the negotiations. The "Daily Worker" attacked Harrison for displaying a kind of racial superiority complex of an American soldier on the issue of neutral nations.

The "Daily Worker" editorial pointed out: "The British people demand an immediate armistice agreement in Korea." They will never allow Harrison's "typical attitude of arrogant racial superiority" to undermine the armistice negotiations.

The "Daily Worker" editorial concluded by urging the British people to "demand that the United States stop undermining the armistice negotiations, otherwise British troops should be withdrawn from Korea immediately."

The London "Daily Worker" reported on May 2nd that four Labour MPs were preparing to visit the British government to demand that British representatives must participate in the Korean armistice negotiations. These four MPs are: Mrs. Barbara Castle, Desmond Donnelly, Arthur Henderson and Beswick.

The "Daily Worker" wrote: This shows that British people, especially Labour Party members, are increasingly angered by the American negotiators who are delaying the return of British soldiers from Korea.

    英国“工人日报”斥责哈利逊的专横态度
    【新华社布拉格五日电】五月一日伦敦“工人日报”谴责美国朝鲜停战谈判首席代表哈利逊在谈判中的专横态度。“工人日报”抨击哈利逊在中立国问题上表现了一种美国军人的种族优越主义。
    “工人日报”社论指出：“英国人民要求立即在朝鲜达成停战协议。”他们决不让哈利逊的“狂妄的种族优越主义的典型态度”来破坏停战谈判。
    “工人日报”社论在结语中敦促英国人民“要求美国不再破坏停战谈判，否则英国军队就立即从朝鲜撤回来。”
    五月二日伦敦“工人日报”报道有四个工党议员准备访英国政府，要求必须有英国代表参加朝鲜停战谈判。这四个议员是：巴巴拉·卡斯尔夫人、德斯蒙德·唐纳利、阿瑟·汉德逊与贝斯威克。
    “工人日报”写道：这说明英国人士，特别是工党人士对于使英国士兵迟迟不能从朝鲜回来的美国谈判代表已感到愈来愈大的愤怒。
