Xinhua News Agency report: Repatriated British, American, and Australian sick and wounded POWs have praised the humane treatment they received from the Korean and Chinese side.

British sick and wounded POWs, after returning to Britain, spoke highly of the humane treatment they received from the Korean and Chinese side to reporters who visited them. All the British sick and wounded POWs were very tanned, healthy, and well-nourished. Many POWs condemned the Korean War as "stupid" and "pointless." Sarliz said: "The Korean War is meaningless. It is being fought to make money. It has nothing to do with us at all. I am very upset by the American intervention in Korea. I am a reservist. If the war is still going on after I leave the army, I will talk about this issue at various gatherings." Lalz said that the Korean War was "pointless," and he said: "Everyone in Korea is tired of the war... Many soldiers on the front lines are also like this." He said: The Americans bombed North Korea, "killing a large number of women and children, and I don't like doing that." Regarding the American Air Force's use of bacteriological warfare, Lalz said: "Yes, I believe this is the case, and the other brothers I know also believe it." All the repatriated POWs mentioned that the Korean and Chinese side often gave them current affairs reports. McNally said: "This is not propaganda. They just tell us what is happening."

All the British sick and wounded POWs admitted that they were treated very well in the POW camps. Sarliz said: "We were treated very well, had good food, and we each received two sets of summer clothes and one set of winter clothes." He was captured in January 1951. He said: "When we were first captured, we had to walk to the Yalu River. It was easy, we walked twelve miles a day and rested every three days. Anyone who couldn't walk was transported by car." O'Donnell said: "The rations I got were as good as what I got in England. I have nothing to complain about." Hunter refuted the lies about the Korean and Chinese side "mistreating" POWs, saying that he and the POWs with him were "indeed treated very fairly." Hunter said: "After we were captured, we walked three hundred miles, but because of my injury, I was carried most of the way."

American POW Widiel said in Tokyo, "We were treated very well. The Communist medical technology is very good, and there are many, many Chinese doctors." POW Blitt said that after he was captured, he was sent to a first-aid station and received medical treatment. He said that under the local conditions, the treatment he received was "quite good." POW Cox also said that the Korean and Chinese side gave him good medical treatment. POW Lane said, "I think they (the Korean and Chinese side) treat us medically the same way they treat their own people, and they give us the same food they eat themselves."

The Australian "Sydney Morning Herald" and other newspapers prominently published a Tokyo report on April 25 stating that the five Australian soldiers who were repatriated on April 23 said that they had no reason to complain about the treatment they received from the Korean and Chinese side. The medical treatment they received was the same as that received by wounded Chinese soldiers, and Chinese doctors saved the lives of two Australians.

    被遣返的英、美、澳病伤战俘
    称道朝中方面的人道待遇
    据新华社讯：被遣返的英、美、澳病伤战俘称道朝中方面给予他们的人道待遇。
    被遣返的英国病伤战俘在回到英国以后，向访问他们的记者极口称道朝中方面给予他们的人道待遇。所有英国病伤战俘都晒得很黑、很健康而且营养良好。许多战俘都斥责朝鲜战争是“愚蠢的”和
    “没有好处的”。萨尔利兹说：“朝鲜战争毫无意义。这是为了要赚钱而打的。这根本与我们没有关系。我对于美国在朝鲜的干涉行为感到很痛心。我是一个后备兵。假使等我脱离军队以后，战争还在继续进行的话，我将在各种集会上来谈谈这个问题。”拉尔兹说，朝鲜战争是“没有好处”的，他说：“在朝鲜的每一个人都厌倦战争……许多前线的士兵也是这样。”他说：美国人轰炸北朝鲜，“杀害了大批的妇女和儿童，我不喜欢这样做”。关于美国空军进行细菌战，拉尔兹说：“是的，我相信这件事情，而且我认识的其他弟兄们也相信这件事。”所有被遣返的战俘都谈到朝中方面经常给他们作时事报告。麦克那利说：“这并不是宣传。他们只是告诉我们发生了什么事情。”
    所有英国病伤战俘都承认他们在战俘营中受到很好的待遇。萨尔利兹说：“我们受到很好的待遇，有很好的食物，我们每人都领到两套夏衣，一套冬衣。”他是在一九五一年一月被俘的。他说：“当我们刚被俘的时候，我们必须要走到鸭绿江边。这是很容易的，我们每天走十二英里，每三天休息一天。凡是不能走的人都用车子运。”奥当纳说：“我得到的口粮和在英国所得到的一样好。我没有任何可抱怨的事情。”亨特驳斥那些关于朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎话，他说：他和同他在一起的战俘都“的确得到非常公道的待遇”。亨特说：“我们被俘之后曾走了三百英里路，但是我因受伤的缘故，大部分路都是被人抬着走的。”
    美国战俘韦狄尔在东京说，“我们受到很好的待遇。共方的医疗技术很好，并且有很多很多中国医生。”战俘布利特说，他在被俘以后就被送到急救站去，并得到了医疗。他说，在当地的条件下，他所受到的待遇是“满好的”。战俘柯克斯也说朝中方面给了他很好的医疗。战俘莱恩说，“我认为他们
    （朝中方面）医疗我们和医疗自己人是一样的，他们给我们吃的食物也和自己吃的一样。”
    澳大利亚“悉尼先锋晨报”和其他报纸在四月二十五日以显著地位登载一篇东京报道说，四月二十三日被遣返的五个澳大利亚士兵说，他们没有理由抱怨朝中方面对他们的待遇。他们所受到的医疗待遇和中国伤兵所受到的是一样的，并且中国医生还救了两个澳大利亚人的性命。
