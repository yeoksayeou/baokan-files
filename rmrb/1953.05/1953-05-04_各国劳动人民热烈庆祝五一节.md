The laboring people of various countries warmly celebrate May Day

    Korea
    A rally was held in Pyongyang on the evening of April 30th by people from all walks of life to celebrate International Labor Day in a grand manner.  Korean Deputy Prime Minister Chung Il-yong delivered a commemorative report at the rally, stating that the Korean people are greeting May Day amidst the fierce Fatherland Liberation War that has been ongoing for three years. In the process of Korea's war against American armed aggression and defending the fatherland, the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have become even stronger, our rear has been further consolidated, the organization of the Korean Workers' Party has been further strengthened, the labor achievements of the Korean laboring people have been further expanded, and the support of the people of various brotherly countries for us has also been further strengthened.  Chung Il-yong then pointed out that due to the statements made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Premier Kim Il-sung, and Foreign Minister Molotov on the Korean armistice negotiations, and due to the unanimous support of the people of the world for our peaceful proposals, the Korean armistice negotiations have resumed. Whether the meeting can reach a cease-fire depends entirely on whether the US side has sincerity.  The US side must prove its sincerity not with empty words but with actions.

    Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order on May 1st to all commanders, fighters, male and female guerrillas, and the people of the whole country of Korea. The order pointed out that without leaving the banner of Lenin-Stalin internationalism, it would be impossible to defend national independence, freedom, and rights from imperialist aggression, and there would be no true patriotism. Therefore, we must be even more faithful than ever to internationalist solidarity and crush all the enemy's cunning and sinister conspiracies.

    Mongolia
    The laboring people of the Mongolian People's Republic joyfully celebrated May Day. In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, the parade marched early in the morning from all directions toward Sukhbaatar Square. On Sukhbaatar Square, the capital garrison stood flanking the Sukhbaatar monument facing Marshal Choibalsan's tomb. At eleven o'clock, the leaders of the Mongolian government and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, led by Prime Minister Tsedenbal, as well as the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, China, and Korea, ascended Marshal Choibalsan's mausoleum.

    Deputy Prime Minister Shirindib delivered a speech on behalf of the Mongolian government and the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

    Then, the capital garrison held a review.  The laboring people's procession followed. Among the ranks were workers from the Choibalsan Joint Industrial Factory, the Nalaikh Coal Mine, and other factories, as well as herdsmen from nearby villages.

    Celebratory parades and rallies were also held in Choibalsan City, Sukhbaatar City, and many other cities.

    Poland
    The laboring people of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, held a celebration rally on May Day, with the participation of hundreds of thousands of people.  Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Boles≈Çaw Bierut, and other party and government leaders attended the celebration.  Representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions, trade union delegations from the Soviet Union, China, and other countries, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Poland were invited to attend the ceremony.  Chairman Bierut delivered a speech at the rally, congratulating the working class around the world for their unity in the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.  In his speech, he paid lofty tribute to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.

They also expressed the profound friendship of the Czechoslovak people towards the Soviet Union and all other countries in the peace camp.

    German Democratic Republic
    Berlin held a grand demonstration parade on the first day of the month to celebrate International Labor Day. Under the huge portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, hung a slogan made of large gold letters: "May Day 1953 is a day for striving for peace, unity, democracy, and socialism."

The laboring people of Sofia, singing and dancing, shouted "Long live peace, long live socialism" as they passed the reviewing stand.

    Albania
    In Tirana, the capital of Albania, a May Day parade of approximately 60,000 people was held.

Other towns in Albania also held "May Day" parades.

    India
    On May 1, the laboring people of India held demonstrations in various places under the slogans of strengthening the unity of the working class, fighting for improved living conditions, striving for lasting world peace, and fighting for national independence. About 25,000 people, representing 40 trade union organizations, participated in the rally organized by the Delhi Workers' "May Day" Joint Committee. The participants in the demonstration parade marched through the streets of Delhi carrying flags and banners. The banners read: "Long Live May Day - the Day of International Solidarity of the Working Class!"

    After the demonstration parade, a rally was held at Gandhi Square. The meeting unanimously passed resolutions on trade union unity, international peace, and the urgent demands of the working class.

    Indonesia
    On May 1, a rally and demonstration parade of 500,000 people were held in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. The rally and parade were held under the call of the "May Day" Joint Committee, composed of the central organizations of seven Indonesian trade unions, with the active participation of the Indonesian General Labor Union and the Indonesian Communist Party. The rally passed a resolution calling for improved living conditions.

    Japan
    Millions of Japanese laboring people held rallies and demonstrations in more than 400 places across the country on the first day of the month to warmly celebrate International Labor Day.

    Tokyo on the first day was virtually under martial law. The security authorities acted as if facing a formidable enemy, dispatching more than 20,000 armed police and a large number of armed vehicles. Police sentry posts were erected everywhere, blocking many traffic arteries, especially the People's Plaza in front of the Imperial Palace, the venue originally scheduled by the trade unions to hold the "May Day" rally. This hostile situation in no way dampened the determination of the laboring people of Tokyo to grandly celebrate "May Day." Four to five hundred thousand workers, students, and citizens belonging to various trade unions gathered at the Outer Garden of Meiji Shrine early in the morning on the first day to enthusiastically participate in the "May Day" celebration rally. On the large curtain behind the rostrum was a peace dove, and on the banners on both sides were the large-character slogans: "Oppose Rearmament" and "Stop the Korean War." Red flags fluttered in the venue, and slogans such as "American Soldiers Get Out" were conspicuously written on the banners.

    Representatives of political parties and trade unions such as the Japanese Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party delivered speeches at the meeting. They unanimously opposed Japan's rearmament and militarization of bases, called for overthrowing the Yoshida fascist government, and demanded an end to the Korean War. The declaration issued by the meeting said: Contrary to our desire for world peace and Japan's complete independence, Japan has completely become an American military base and has become a live volcano lying on the edge of Asia. The United States is forcing Japan to rearm against the will of the Japanese people. The Yoshida Cabinet, disregarding the people's resistance, insists on reorganizing the conservative camp and pursuing a rearmament policy. The declaration then emphasized: However, the forces of world peace are growing stronger, forcing reactionary forces into a desperate situation. This has given the hundreds of millions of people around the world tremendous hope. The Japanese working class will disregard the oppression of monopoly capital, increasingly strengthen unity, and push the historical struggle forward. The meeting also passed a number of resolutions, including opposing rearmament, demanding an early end to the Korean War, and opposing the suppression of labor.

    After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration parade in an orderly manner according to the predetermined route.

    On the same day, in Osaka, Hiroshima, Sapporo, and other places, hundreds of thousands of Japanese laboring people also held rallies and demonstrations.

    France
    The "May Day" mass demonstration parade of the laboring people of Paris lasted for approximately five hours. The parade moved in an orderly manner from the Place de la Nation to the Place de la Bastille.

    At the Place de la Bastille, French Communist Party leaders Jacques Duclos, Marcel Cachin, Auguste Lecoeur, √âtienne Fajon, Raymond Guyot, Jeannette Vermeersch, and Waldeck Rochet welcomed the parading people on the reviewing stand. Also on the reviewing stand were General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour Le Brun, leaders of the Paris district trade union organizations, and prominent social leaders and cultural leaders.

    People warmly applauded the workers of the Renault automobile factory who bravely defended their economic rights and trade union freedom. Their ranks included members of the French General Confederation of Labour, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, and the socialist trade union "Workers' Force." They shouted slogans demanding unified action by the entire French working class.

    The demonstrators also firmly demanded an end to the persecution of progressive organizations, the release of arrested patriots, the termination of the wars in Vietnam and Korea, and the abandonment of the arms expansion policy.

    "L'Humanit√©" reported that large-scale "May Day" demonstrations and various gatherings were also held throughout France. In Valenciennes, more than 1,500 police and so-called "Republican Security Companies" attacked demonstrators, resulting in 100 injuries and approximately 200 arrests.

    West Germany
    West German laborers commemorated International Labor Day under the slogans: Oppose war preparations, oppose the Bonn government's military treaties, oppose poverty, defend democratic rights, strive for German reunification, and conclude a just peace treaty with Germany.

    According to the German News Agency, more than 100,000 people participated in the "May Day" demonstration parade in Bremen, of which 14,000 were striking workers from the Bremen shipyard. In D√ºsseldorf, approximately 50,000 communist, social democratic, and non-party workers participated in the demonstration. 50,000 people participated in the demonstration in Dortmund, and 30,000 people participated in the demonstration in Bielefeld. Large-scale demonstrations were also held in Stuttgart, Munich, Essen, Hamburg, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Mannheim, and many other places.

    The demonstrators were obstructed by the right-wing trade union leaders of West Germany and persecuted by the police. In Munich, the police attacked and arrested demonstrators because they were carrying banners calling for opposition to West German militarization and opposition to the Bonn and Paris treaties. Incidents of clashes between police and demonstrators occurred in D√ºsseldorf, Stuttgart, and other cities.

    Austria
    The Austrian Communist Party organized a grand May Day demonstration parade in Vienna. On the morning of May 1, Stalin Square in Vienna was filled with thousands upon thousands of workers, staff, housewives, artisans, and students. They held portraits of Stalin, light blue peace flags, and banners that read: "Stalin Lives Forever in Our Hearts!" "Long Live Friendship with the Great Soviet Union!" "Strive for World Peace!" "Strengthen the Unity of the Working Class in the Struggle for Peace and Against the Reactionary Policies of the Raab Government!" Koplenig, Honner, F√ºrnberg, and other leaders of the Austrian Communist Party congratulated the parading masses on the podium near the Parliament Building.

    Finland
    In Finland, the laboring people of Helsinki also held a demonstration parade and mass rally on May 1 under the call of the Helsinki Workers' May Day Joint Committee to celebrate International Labor Day. The demonstrators held many banners and propaganda paintings, calling for struggle to defend peace and democracy, consolidate Finnish-Soviet friendship, and improve the living standards of the laboring people. At the mass rally, Piminov, the representative of the Soviet delegation participating in the May Day celebration, gave a congratulatory speech to the meeting. Finnish Member of Parliament Herta Kuusinen then delivered a speech.

    Switzerland
    The Swiss Labour Party organized "May Day" demonstrations in Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and other cities. The demonstrations were held under the slogans: Oppose rearmament; Strive for democratic freedom for all working people; Strive for peace; Strive for friendship among all countries, especially friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

    also went on strike demanding improved living conditions.

    Denmark
    On May 1, the Danish laboring people held mass demonstrations and rallies in Copenhagen, the capital, and in 19 other cities including Aarhus and Odense.

    The demonstrators held red flags and banners during the parade, calling for the independence of Denmark, for opposing the stationing of foreign troops in Denmark, for Denmark's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Alliance, and for reducing military spending.

    At the mass rally, a resolution was passed calling for strengthening the struggle against war and militarization, for peace and improved living conditions, and for defending the sovereignty of the motherland.

    United States
    On May 1, several thousand New York workers attended a "May Day" Labor Day rally held in Union Square. The rally demanded peace and democratic rights.

    Fur Workers Union leader Leon Strauss, writer Howard Fast, and others who spoke at the meeting called for an immediate ceasefire in Korea, an end to the Cold War, and the settlement of international disputes through negotiations. They also emphasized the need to fight for democratic rights and defend workers' rights.

    Attendees carried hundreds of flags with slogans mainly calling for peace. Many flags read: "Peace Now!" "Peace Budget, Not War Budget!"

    The police authorities allowed the rally to take place, but it banned the traditional "May Day" parade in the streets of New York. Approximately one thousand mounted and foot police patrolled Union Square and the surrounding streets.

    Lebanon
    The laboring people of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, held a grand demonstration on May 1, which was attended by workers, farmers, and trade union delegations from other parts of Lebanon.
