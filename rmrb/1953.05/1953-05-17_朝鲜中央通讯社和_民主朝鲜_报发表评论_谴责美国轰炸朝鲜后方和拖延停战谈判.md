Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: Korean public opinion unanimously denounces the U.S. aggressors for intensifying the bombing of Korean rear areas and delaying armistice negotiations. The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 15th, stating: In order for the Korean armistice issue to achieve a fair and reasonable resolution, a sincere attitude, constructive efforts, and a spirit of consultation are needed, not “military pressure” and stubbornness that are of no help. However, the U.S. side, on the one hand, insists on illogical and unrealistic absurd propositions in Panmunjom, obstructing the realization of the armistice; on the other hand, it sends air force to intensify the indiscriminate bombing, bombing reservoirs in the Sunan area of ​​the Korean rear and the transmission equipment of hydroelectric power plants such as Shuifeng, hindering the progress of armistice negotiations. This constitutes a great threat to the world's people's wishes and demands for the realization of an armistice in Korea. The commentary pointed out: For the benefit of peace-loving people all over the world (including the American people), the Korean people will continue to strive for the realization of the Korean armistice and peace with sincere efforts. However, we are vigilant about the enemy's conspiracies and will never allow any of the enemy's conspiracies to succeed. If the U.S. imperialists go so far as to destroy the road to an armistice in Korea, then they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous failures militarily, politically, and morally.
　　"Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 15th, saying: The U.S. aggressors have recently created even more vicious bombing atrocities. On May 9th, U.S. aircraft bombed a location near Wei Yuan, Ciang Province, no more than 700 meters away from our fourth prisoner-of-war camp. Afterwards, U.S. aircraft indiscriminately bombed Yangshi south of Sinuiju and northeastern China, and carried out extremely crazy and vicious bombing of reservoirs in the Sunan area, which were completely unrelated to military targets. The editorial pointed out: The enemy’s vicious atrocities were created after the enemy rejected our most just and reasonable proposal in the armistice negotiations in order to achieve its attempt to obstruct the armistice negotiations. This is the "sincere" effort that the enemy has shown for the Korean armistice and their proclaimed "humanitarianism".
　　The editorial finally emphasized: No atrocities by the enemy can shake the Korean people's will to fight. The Korean people want to tell the U.S. warmongering ambitionists: Your various atrocities will absolutely not help your aggressive ambitions in any way.

    朝鲜中央通讯社和“民主朝鲜”报发表评论
    谴责美国轰炸朝鲜后方和拖延停战谈判
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜舆论界一致痛斥美国侵略者加紧轰炸朝鲜后方和拖延停战谈判的罪恶行为。朝鲜中央通讯社十五日发表评论说：为使朝鲜停战问题获得公平合理的解决，需要真挚的态度、建设性的努力和协商的精神，而不需要那些没有任何帮助作用的“军事压力”和固执。但是美方却一方面在板门店坚持不合逻辑的和非现实性的荒谬主张，阻碍停战的实现；另一方面又派遣空军加紧进行狂轰滥炸，轰炸了朝鲜后方顺安地区的贮水池和水丰等发电所的送电设备，阻挠停战谈判的进行。这对于世界人民实现朝鲜停战的意愿和要求，构成了很大的威胁。评论指出：朝鲜人民为了全世界爱好和平人民（包括美国人民在内）的利益，将继续以诚意的努力来争取朝鲜停战的实现与和平。但是，我们警惕着敌人的阴谋，绝不容许敌人的任何阴谋得逞。如果美帝国主义者竟而走向破坏朝鲜停战的道路，那么他们将不可避免地要在军事上、政治上和道德上遭到更加惨重的失败。
    “民主朝鲜”报十五日发表社论说：美国侵略者在最近更加恶毒地制造了轰炸的暴行。五月九日，美机曾轰炸了慈江道渭原附近距我方第四俘虏收容所不过七百公尺远的地点。其后，美机又滥炸新义州以南的杨市和中国的东北地区，并对于军事目标毫无关联的顺安地区的贮水池，进行了极端疯狂恶毒的轰炸。社论指出：敌人这种凶恶的暴行，是敌人在停战谈判中拒绝了我方最公正合理的提案之后、为达到它阻挠停战谈判的企图而制造的。这便是敌人对朝鲜停战所表示的“诚意”的努力和他们叫嚷的“人道主义”。
    社论最后强调说：敌人的任何暴行，丝毫不能动摇朝鲜人民的斗争意志。朝鲜人民要正告美国好战的野心家们：你们的这种种暴行，是绝对不会对你们的侵略野心有任何帮助的。
