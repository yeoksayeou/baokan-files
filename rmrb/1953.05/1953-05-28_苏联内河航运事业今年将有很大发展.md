Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet inland waterway navigation season has begun. This year, Soviet inland waterway transportation will continue to develop greatly. The volume of goods transported by Soviet inland waterways this year will increase by 10% compared to last year, and from April to June, it will increase by 21% compared to the same period last year. The Lenin Volga-Don Canal occupies a very important position in Soviet inland waterway transportation. The total volume of goods transported on this waterway, which connects various seas in the European part of the Soviet Union, will triple this year. Among them, the amount of northern timber transported will increase fivefold, and the amount of Donets coal transported will increase eightfold. The Soviet Union is not only paying attention to the transportation of large rivers, but is also carrying out a lot of work using small rivers. In the Russian Federation alone, the navigable length of small rivers will increase by another 1,000 kilometers this year. In order to facilitate navigation on small rivers, Soviet shipyards have also specially manufactured a new type of small river transport motorboat this year. The structure of this small motorboat is very special. It is not propelled by propellers. It is equipped with a pressurized water pump pipeline from bow to stern, and it moves forward by the impulsive force generated by the water flow discharged by this water pump. This boat can travel at 15 kilometers per hour, and its draft is half as shallow as that of an ordinary tugboat of the same size.

    苏联内河航运事业今年将有很大发展
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联内河航运季节已经开始。今年苏联内河航运事业将继续有很大的发展。苏联内河运货量今年将比去年增加百分之十，其中四月份到六月份将比去年同期增加百分之二十一。列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河在苏联内河航运事业中占着很重要的地位。这条贯通苏联欧洲部分各个海的河道的运货总量，今年将增加到三倍，其中运输北部木材的数量将增加到五倍，运输顿尼兹煤的数量将增加到八倍。苏联不仅注意大河的运输，而且还在利用小河上进行许多工作。仅只俄罗斯联邦一地，小河通航长度今年即将再增加一千公里。为了便于在小河上航行，今年苏联造船厂还特别制造了一种新型的小河载运汽艇。这种小汽艇的构造很特别。它不是用螺旋桨推进。它从船头到船尾装备着一条有压水机的铺管，它就借这压水机排出水流所发生的冲力前进。这种船每小时可行十五公里，而且吃水比同样大小的普通拖船要浅一倍。
