The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee Mobilizes All Party Members and Cadres to Do a Good Job in the General Election
In order to mobilize all Party members and cadres to actively participate in the general election, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee held a city-wide meeting of Party members and cadres on May 16th, attended by more than 2,000 Party members and cadres from municipal and district-level departments. At the meeting, He Xia, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, delivered a report entitled "Mobilize and Do a Good Job in the General Election," specifically outlining the various tasks for carrying out the general election movement in the city. He called on all Communist Party members, workers, and people from all walks of life to give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in production and work, and to excellently complete various construction tasks to welcome this epoch-making joyous event. Regarding how to conduct the general election in Shenyang, He Xia first made a detailed analysis of the city's basic conditions such as population and district divisions, and made an assessment of the city's past experience in people's democratic elections. He pointed out: Shenyang has not yet had an accurate population statistic in its household registration work, and there are some problems in the work of controlling counter-revolutionary elements; especially in the publicity of the three major tasks of this year, the great significance of the general election has not been sufficiently publicized, and the masses of people still do not clearly understand the general election. He Xia said: This requires a series of arduous tasks. First, do in-depth and extensive publicity work to ensure that everyone understands the great historical significance of implementing the general election and to ensure that the maximum number of voters in the city participate in the grassroots elections. It is also required to closely integrate the work steps of population census, voter registration, nominating candidates, holding elections, and convening people's congresses, and specifically do a good job in the publicity work at each stage.

He Xia pointed out: The basic problem of grassroots election work is to do a good job in population census, voter registration, and voter qualification review. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the population census, voter registration, and voter qualification review work is free from omissions and errors; it is necessary to combine production, facilitate the masses, and complete several tasks in one procedure in a simple and easy way. To ensure that the voter review work is accurate and error-free, sufficient investigation and research must be carried out in advance so that we can be clear about the situation. The focus of the review should be on those people whose boundaries between deprivation and non-deprivation are unclear. He Xia used many actual materials from the city to explain the policy spirit of the election law and the interpretation of voter qualifications promulgated by the central government, and asked Party members and cadres to be familiar with and master these spirits, and correctly solve the specific problems of each voter. Grassroots elections should be combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, so that cadres and the masses receive a profound democratic education.

Regarding the steps and time arrangement for carrying out the general election in the city, He Xia put forward the principles of unified pace, easy to grasp, alternating between urban and suburban areas, facilitating the masses, and not affecting production. The city's general election work is divided into two steps: one step includes population census, voter registration, voter review, and publication of voter lists; the other step is to complete the grassroots elections. The city must complete the work of deploying cadres by mid-June, and complete the training, organization, and key district pilot work before the end of June. Regarding the rural areas in the suburbs, it is required to conduct a population census and voter registration in August according to their production situation, and complete the general election in the month after the busy autumn harvest season. The city will complete the population census and voter registration in July, and strive to complete the grassroots general election in September. The date of the convening of the Municipal People's Congress will be determined after instructions from the Central Election Committee.

Regarding the current work, He Xia put forward the following items: 1. Establish institutions, equip cadres, organize teams, and train cadres. 2. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, closely combine the requirements of the general election work, and carry out publicity work in a planned and step-by-step manner. 3. Ensure the correct implementation of household registration rectification and voter qualification review work. 4. Combine the general election work with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. 5. Strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels, and ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies in every work link. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the entire Party and the entire people, all departments cooperate closely, frequently check, summarize experience in a timely manner, and prevent deviations from occurring.

    中共沈阳市委动员全市党员干部做好普选工作
    中共沈阳市委会为动员全市党员干部积极参加普选工作，于五月十六日召开全市党员干部大会，参加大会的有市级、区级各部门的党员干部两千多人。会上，中共沈阳市委副书记何侠以“动员起来，做好普选工作”为题作报告，具体地布置了有关该市开展普选运动的各项工作。他要求全市共产党员、职工和各界人民高度发挥生产与工作的积极性和创造性，出色地完成各项建设任务，来迎接这件划时代的大喜事。关于如何在沈阳市进行普选的问题，何侠首先对该市的人口、区划等基本情况作了细致的分析，对过去该市人民民主选举工作的情况做了估计。他指出：沈阳市在户口工作上，到目前还没有一个精确的人口统计数字，在对反革命分子的管制工作上也有着一些问题；尤其是在宣传今年的三大任务时，对普选的重大意义宣传得十分不够，人民群众对普选还认识不清。何侠说：这就要求进行一系列的艰苦工作。首先是做好深入广泛的宣传工作，使每一个人都能了解实行普选的伟大历史意义，保证全市选民最大限度地参加基层选举。并要求密切结合人口调查、选民登记、提候选人、举行选举、召开人民代表大会等工作步骤，具体做好各阶段的宣传工作。
    何侠指出：基层选举工作的基本问题，就是作好人口调查、选民登记和选民资格审查。因此必须保证人口调查、选民登记和选民资格审查工作不漏不错；必须结合生产，便利群众，简便易行地用一道手续完成几件工作。要作到选民的审查工作准确不错，事前就必须进行充分的调查研究，以便心中有数。审查的重点应该放在剥夺与否的界限分不清的那些人上。何侠用该市的许多实际材料，说明了中央公布的选举法和关于选民资格解释等文件中的政策精神，要求党员干部熟悉和掌握这些精神，正确解决每个选民的具体问题。基层选举要结合反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，使干部和群众受到一次深刻的民主教育。
    关于该市进行普选工作的步骤和时间的安排问题，何侠提出统一步调、易于掌握、市内市郊交错进行、便利群众、不影响生产的原则。全市普选工作分为两个步骤：一个步骤包括人口调查、选民登记、选民审查、公布选民名单；另一个步骤是完成基层选举。全市要在六月中旬做好调配干部工作，在六月底以前完成训练、编队和分区重点试验工作。关于市郊农村，要求根据其生产情况，在八月间进行人口调查和选民登记，在秋收紧张阶段后的一个月中完成普选。市内则在七月份完成人口调查和选民登记，争取在九月份完成基层普选。市人民代表大会召开的日期，待中央选举委员会指示后再确定。
    关于目前的工作，何侠提出以下几项：一、建立机构，配备干部，组织队伍，训练干部。二、在党委统一领导下，密切结合普选工作的要求，有计划有步骤地开展宣传工作。三、保证户口整顿工作与选民资格审查工作的正确进行。四、以普选工作为主结合进行反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪斗争。五、加强各级党的领导，在每一工作环节上保证党的政策正确执行。因此必须实行全党全民动员，各部门通力合作，勤检查，及时总结经验，防止偏向发生。
