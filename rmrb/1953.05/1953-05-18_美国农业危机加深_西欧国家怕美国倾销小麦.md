Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th dispatch from TASS: Chicago grain exchange wheat prices fell to their lowest level since 1950 in the week ending the 9th. The drop in wheat prices reflects the increase in unsalable surplus wheat and the substantial shrinkage of foreign markets.

According to the "Journal of Commerce": U.S. wheat exports have recently decreased sharply compared with the previous wheat season. It is expected that the total amount of wheat exported by the United States this year will be about 325 million bushels, while it was 475 million bushels in the previous wheat season. According to the "Journal of Commerce" forecast, wheat stocks will reach 575 million bushels by July 1. This, plus the estimated harvest of about 1 billion bushels, will bring the supply to about 1.575 billion bushels, while the domestic demand for wheat in the United States is estimated at only 685 million bushels. In view of the large accumulation of surplus wheat in Canada, Australia, and Argentina, the "Journal of Commerce" expressed pessimism about the future trend of wheat prices.

The unsalability of wheat is only one aspect of the deterioration of the agricultural situation in the United States. The "Journal of Commerce" admitted in an editorial: "Since the autumn of 1952, prices of agricultural products and farmers' income have decreased significantly. Compared with a year ago, wholesale prices of agricultural products have fallen by about 10 percent... Due to rising production costs, farmers' net income in 1953 may fall by another 10 to 20 percent compared with last year..."

According to a report by the "Journal of Commerce" correspondent in Washington: Western European agricultural countries are worried that the difficulties in American agriculture may cause the United States to sell surplus agricultural products in foreign markets at dumping prices. The Dutch Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, Mansholt, who is currently visiting the United States, has openly expressed this concern. Mansholt believes that the surplus of U.S. agricultural products is "a great threat to the international market," and he is particularly concerned about the possibility of U.S. dairy product dumping.

According to the "Journal of Commerce": "In other countries' embassies, people are not only afraid that the massive dumping of surplus dairy products (milk powder, butter, and cheese) by the United States will disrupt foreign market prices, but also worried that once the United States exports dairy products abroad at low prices, European countries will lose their traditional foreign markets for these commodities."

### 美国农业危机加深  西欧国家怕美国倾销小麦

    美国农业危机加深
    西欧国家怕美国倾销小麦
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：芝加哥谷物交易所小麦价格在到九日为止的一周跌落到一九五零年以来的最低水平。小麦价格的下跌，反映了过剩小麦滞销量的增加以及国外市场的大大萎缩。
    据“商务日报”说：美国小麦出口最近比上一小麦季节急剧减少，预料今年美国输出的小麦一共为三亿二千五百万蒲式耳左右，而上一小麦季节则为四亿七千五百万蒲式耳。根据“商务日报”的预测，小麦积存量到七月一日将达五亿七千五百万蒲式耳，这加上估计中约十亿蒲式耳的收获量，供应量就大约等于十五亿七千五百万蒲式耳，而美国国内小麦的需求量估计仅为六亿八千五百万蒲式耳。鉴于加拿大、澳大利亚及阿根廷也积存了大批剩余小麦，“商务日报”对今后小麦价格趋势表示悲观。
    小麦滞销只是美国农业情况恶化的一个方面。“商务日报”在社论中承认：“自一九五二年秋天以来，农产品价格与农民的收入都显著降低。与一年前比较，农产品批发价格约下降了百分之十……由于生产成本高涨，农民的纯收入在一九五三年还可能比去年再下降百分之十至百分之二十……。”
    据“商务日报”驻华盛顿记者报道：西欧农业国家正在担忧美国农业的困难可能引起美国以倾销价格在国外市场抛售剩余农产品。目前访美的荷兰农业、渔业与粮食大臣曼邵尔特已公开表示这种忧虑。曼邵尔特认为：美国农产品过剩是“国际市场的一个很大的威胁”，他对于美国乳制品倾销的可能性特别感到不安。
    据“商务日报”报道：“在其他国家的大使馆里，人们不但害怕美国大量倾销剩余乳制品（奶粉、牛油与乾酪）将会扰乱国外市场价格，而且也担忧美国一旦以低价向国外输出乳制品，欧洲国家将会丧失这些商品的传统的国外市场。”
