New Atmosphere in Wangcheng Township
Li Zhenbo, Zheng Pingdong

During a busy spring plowing season, we visited Wangcheng Township in Xishui County, Hubei Province. The farmers of Wangcheng Township are busily delivering fertilizer, plowing fields, and planting cotton. Rice seedlings have emerged, wheat ears are swaying with white flowers, and rape plants are about to be harvested. As the season of harvesting wheat and transplanting rice approaches, people are working happily.

We went to the township government to find Township Chief Chen Xueming, but the township government was locked. We went to his home, but he wasn't there either. We inquired along the way and circled around the fields several times before we finally found him. He was delivering manure with the mutual aid group members. He smiled and said to us, "Comrades, if it wasn't my day on duty, you wouldn't be able to find me at the township government." He then told us that the Wangcheng Township cadres had solved the problem of "work delays production" for almost a year. They established a system of rotating duty days for the main township cadres. In the past, all township cadres would gather at the township government whether there was anything to do or not, waiting for tasks. Now, one person is on duty at the township government every afternoon on a rotating basis. During busy farming seasons, only one person is on duty every three days. Since the winter before last, all township cadres have participated in and led production. After the autumn harvest last year, nine township cadres were named labor models. Meetings have been greatly reduced, and mass gatherings have been even fewer. Only one evening a month is used for a mass gathering for "Patriotism Day." Wangcheng Township cadres have also generally learned to use mutual aid networks to lead the township's production work separately. In this way, they have saved cadres and the masses a great deal of valuable time over the past year.

One afternoon, we went to the township government again. That day was Township Chief Chen Xueming's day on duty, and he was helping a farmer solve the problem of acquiring farm tools. Township Government Secretary Cai Zhijiang was compiling statistics on agricultural loans; Credit Cooperative Accountant Li Youlong was calculating on an abacus next to him. We asked:

"Are there many statistical forms this year?" Cai Zhijiang said: "Not many, only a few forms for water conservancy and agricultural loans have been filled out in the past three months!" Li Youlong stopped his abacus and said to Cai Zhijiang: "When I was the secretary (now the secretary) the year before last, I filled out an average of twenty-eight kinds of forms a month. Even the number of rice borers, moths, and insect-catching torches had to be statistically recorded. I was busy filling out forms all day long. If I didn't fill them out, they would say I wasn't responsible." He turned to us and said, "To be honest, there were too many numbers I didn't know at that time, so I had to estimate half and 'imagine' (fabricate) half. If a form was sent in the morning and had to be filled out in the afternoon, what could I do?" We asked a farmer who came to the township government to handle some business: "How is the manure preparation going this year?" He said: "To be honest with you, thirty-five loads of mud manure are being applied per unit of rice paddy." We also asked, "Are there many meetings this year?" He said: "Meetings? They are all important. How would we know about new experiences like fertilizer preparation and yellow mud water seed selection if we didn't have meetings? Since the Spring Festival this year, there have only been four or five meetings."

We arrived at the home of Yang Changrong, deputy secretary of the Wangcheng Township branch of the Communist Party of China. Yang Changrong had just returned from planting cotton in the fields. Mentioning the past, he smiled and said to his wife, Pei Benhua, "You won't lock me out again, will you?" Pei Benhua also smiled and said, "Don't just laugh at me. You didn't produce properly after you divided the land at that time. There was nothing to eat at home, the masses didn't believe what you said, and you let Chairman Mao down!" It turned out that there was such a story between them: In 1951, when Wangcheng Township was being reviewed, Yang Changrong held seven positions concurrently. During the most intense farming season, Yang Changrong only participated in production for twenty days. The masses sarcastically called the cadres "work loafers." They were constantly holding meetings every day, and they couldn't even take care of their sick children at home. Therefore, Pei Benhua was very angry. One night, she locked the door and wouldn't let Yang Changrong go back into the house to sleep. Two years have passed since that incident. Speaking of this, Pei Benhua took out a ledger from the room and asked us to calculate how much work Yang Changrong had done this year. This is the work record book of the mutual aid group. From the eighteenth day of the first lunar month to the tenth day of the third lunar month, more than fifty days, Yang Changrong helped others with sixteen workdays in the mutual aid group, and he worked on his own fields for nearly twenty workdays. Excluding the time he was on duty on a rotating basis this year and the rainy days in spring, the time he delayed production was very little.

Township Chief Chen Xueming also told us about some situations in the township in the past. Between the second half of 1951 and the first half of 1952, the social reform in Wangcheng Township ended, and the central task of the township was to develop production. However, the cadres did not know how to lead production and still used the same methods as the social reform to carry out their work, holding meetings every day. In March and April 1952, cooperatives came to pre-purchase cotton, post offices came to engage in "issuance competitions," and banks came to mobilize for cattle insurance. Cadres were crammed into the township government almost every afternoon and evening for meetings. At that time, it was nominally said that production was the center, but in reality, cadres from all departments were the "center," whoever grasped it tightly was the "center," and production was squeezed out instead. Chen Xueming said that he once arranged water conservancy work (a major event related to the township's harvest), but before he finished the arrangement, a comrade from the post office pulled him and said, "Don't forget the issuance! Emphasize it." As a result, when the issuance was emphasized, water conservancy became unimportant. As a result, the Wangcheng Township's pond repair work was criticized by the county in the spring of that year.

Chen Xueming only worked an average of four days a month in 1951, and during the busiest period in February and March 1952, he only participated in production for one-third of the time. At that time, it was very common for cadres to delay production. From January to March of last year, each of the twenty-one township government committee members spent at least thirty days not producing. Township government committee member Cai Dehua was once plowing in the field when the township government notified him to attend a meeting. The meeting lasted for two days, and the plow was left in the field for two days. Others laughed at him: "In a few days, the plow will take root in the field, and you won't be able to take it back." As a result of the cadres' meetings, they delayed their own production and were unable to lead the masses in production. Wan Denga, a cadre of the ninth natural village (the head of the farmers' association), once held a meeting and called on the masses to apply fertilizer in the rape fields. The farmers asked him: "Have you fertilized your own rape? Don't talk about others, do your own production well first!" Indeed, Wan Denga did not do his own production well, and the weeds in the field were as high as the crops. He originally led a mutual aid group, but the members were afraid of delaying production and not being able to afford to work, so the mutual aid group broke up. Later, these mutual aid group members formed another mutual aid group, but they didn't let him participate. Wan Denga was so angry about this that he cried a lot. In 1951, the production level of all township government committee members and above was mostly below the general production level of the masses.

In December 1951, the county party committee discovered this problem and adjusted the township's work tasks, canceling the "key tasks" such as winter schools that were placed in Wangcheng Township at that time (Wangcheng Township had always been the focus of the county party committee's guidance), emphasizing that all work should be combined with production, so that township cadres had time to participate in production and lead production. However, at that time, the township's institutions were still complex, and cadres still held many concurrent positions. There were too many forms to fill out, and township cadres still had little time to participate in production. By the time of the busy farming season in May 1952, these problems became more prominent. The county party committee then further helped to improve the leadership of the Wangcheng Township branch, reducing the township's thirteen institutions to eight, with all work being unifiedly led and arranged by the party branch; reducing the cadres' concurrent positions, and establishing deputy positions for those concurrent positions that could not be reduced. The main township cadres implemented a rotating duty system for office work and reduced meetings. At the same time, the county-level organs controlled the forms and did not allow them to be sent to the countryside casually. All village cadres participated in production, led production, participated in mutual aid, led mutual aid, and organized five mutual aid networks in the township to exchange production experiences. In this way, the masses would not delay production due to unnecessary meetings, and the main township cadres also had sufficient time to participate in production. As a result of their participation in production, not only did their own production improve, but they also educated the masses with practical experience gained in the production process, thereby alleviating the depression of not being able to lead production. The mutual aid group participated in and led by Yang Changrong, deputy secretary of the township branch, is the banner of production mutual aid in the township. Yang Changrong is now very clear about the importance of "participating in mutual aid and leading mutual aid." He said: "In the past, I didn't participate in mutual aid. What problems were there in mutual aid? It was like a blind man telling fortunes, talking nonsense. Now I have a good understanding." This spring, Wangcheng Township rectified the mutual aid groups and implemented the mutually beneficial policy, starting with Yang Changrong's mutual aid group. After he did a good job in his own mutual aid group, he used the mutual aid network to drive the entire township. Today, all five main township cadres are mutual aid group leaders. They all reflect that only by participating in mutual aid and leading mutual aid can they have "capital." In this way, the prestige of cadres among the masses has also been greatly improved. Wan Denga, the leader of the farmers' association group, had poor production and difficult life in 1951, and the masses did not believe what he said. After the autumn of 1952, he increased grain production by more than ten dan. He could also talk about a set of experiences in a meeting. The masses changed their views on him and actively supported him. He was elected as a model of high yield, received the red flag for high yield excellence, and was elected as a member of the township government committee at the township people's congress.

Since the county party committee helped Wangcheng Township improve its leadership, Wangcheng Township has not "excluded" work other than production. Civil schools, troupes, and other work are still carried out in the township; however, they have not affected production. The reason is that the party branch has achieved unified leadership and unified arrangement. Yang Changrong feels that this is an important guarantee for Wangcheng Township to always focus on production and to correct the phenomenon of "five excesses."

Wangcheng Township has achieved the correction of the "five excesses," cleared obstacles in production, and every corner is full of a positive atmosphere of production. Last year, it achieved a bumper harvest and was named the red flag bumper harvest township in the county. Now, the Wangcheng Township Party Branch is enthusiastically discussing the Party Central Committee's "Instructions on Spring Plowing Production to Party Committees at All Levels" to further examine and improve leadership methods.

    望城乡的新气象
    李振波　郑屏东
    在一个春耕繁忙的日子，我们访问了湖北省浠水县望城乡。望城乡的农民正紧张地送肥、犁田、种棉花；稻秧已经出水，麦穗扬着白花，油菜已将收获。眼看割麦插秧两头忙的季节就要来临了，人们都在愉快地劳动着。
    我们到乡人民政府找乡长陈学明，乡政府锁着大门。又到他家里去找，也没找着。我们一路打听，在田畈里转了好几个圈子，才找到了他。他正和互助组员们一起送粪。他笑着对我们说：“同志，不是我值日，你莫想在乡政府找到我了。”他接着告诉我们：望城乡乡干部解决了“工作就耽误生产”的问题已快有一年了。他们订立了乡主要干部轮流值日的制度。过去是有事无事全乡干部集中在乡政府等候任务，现在是每天下午轮流由一个人在乡政府值日。大农忙时，隔三天才有一个人值日。从前年冬天开始，全乡干部都参加和领导了生产。去年秋收后，有九个乡干部被评成了劳动模范。会议大大减少了，群众性的集会更少了，每一个月只利用一个晚上举行“爱国日”群众性的集会。望城乡干部还普遍学会了运用互助网来分头领导全乡的生产工作。这样，一年来不知节省了干部和群众的多少宝贵的时间。
    一天下午，我们又到乡政府去。那天是乡长陈学明值日，他正在帮助一个农民解决添置农具的问题。乡政府秘书蔡之江正在统计农贷情况；信用合作社的会计李有龙在旁边给他打算盘。我们问：
    “今年统计表多不多？”蔡之江说：“不多啊，这三个多月只填了几张水利和农贷的表！”李有龙停下算盘对蔡之江说：“我前年当书记（即现在的秘书），一个月平均填二十八种表，连捉多少螟虫、飞蛾和捕虫的火把也要来个统计，整天填表忙不赢，不填又说不负责任。”他又转向我们说：“说老实话，那时不晓得的数目字太多了，只好一半估计、一半‘想’（捏造）。有的上午送来的表，下午就要填好，那有什么办法？”我们又问一位来乡政府办事的农民：“今年粪草办得怎么样？”他说：“不瞒同志说，每石谷田施三十五担泥粪是有的。”我们又问：“今年开会多不多？”他说：“开会？那都是重要的，像办肥料，黄泥水选种，这些新经验不开会怎么晓得？今年春节以来，只开了四、五回会。”
    我们到了中共望城乡支部副书记杨长荣家里。杨长荣刚从地里种棉花回来。提起过去的情形，他笑着向他爱人裴本华说：“你再不会把我关在门外了吧？”裴本华也笑着说：“你莫光笑我，你那时分了田不好好生产，家里没吃的，群众不相信你的话，也对不起毛主席呀！”原来他们夫妻之间，有这么一段故事：一九五一年望城乡复查时，杨长荣身兼七职，在最紧张的农忙时节，杨长荣只有二十天参加生产。群众讽刺干部是“工作流氓”，每天不断地开会，家里孩子生病也顾不上管。因此，裴本华非常生气，有一天晚上她关了门，不让杨长荣回屋里睡觉。这件事，转眼已过去二年了。说到这里，裴本华从房里拿出一本账来，叫我们给算一下杨长荣今年做了多少工。这是互助组的记工账。从夏历正月十八日到三月初十日五十多天中，杨长荣在互助组中帮别人做了十六个工、在自己田上做了将近二十个工；除去今年轮流值日和春季雨天外，耽搁生产的时间就很少了。
    乡长陈学明又给我们谈到过去乡里的一些情况。一九五一年下半年和一九五二年上半年之间，望城乡社会改革结束了，乡里的中心任务已经是发展生产了，但是干部不会领导生产，还沿用着社会改革那一套办法进行工作，每天开会。一九五二年三、四月间，合作社来预购棉花，邮局来搞“发行竞赛”，银行来动员耕牛保险，干部差不多每天下午和晚上都挤在乡政府开会。那时，名义上说生产是中心，实际上各个部门的干部都是“中心”，谁抓得紧谁是“中心”，生产反而被挤掉了。陈学明说，他有一次布置水利工作（这是关系全乡收成的大事），还没布置完了，旁边邮局的同志拉着他说：“莫把发行忘了呀！强调一下。”结果，把发行一强调，水利就不重要了。结果，这年春天望城乡修塘工作受到了县里的通报批评。
    陈学明一九五一年每个月平均只做了四天活，一九五二年二、三月顶忙的一段，也只有三分之一的时间参加了生产。当时，干部耽误生产是很平常的事。全乡二十一个乡政委员，从去年元月到三月，每人最少有三十天没生产。乡政委员蔡德华有一次在田里犁田，乡政府通知他去开会，会开了两天，犁也在田里放了两天。别人笑他：“再隔几天，犁在田里生了根，还拿不回去呢。”干部开会的结果，耽误了自己的生产，也没法领导群众生产。第九自然村的干部（农民协会的组长）万登安有一次开会，号召群众在油菜地里追肥。农民问他：“你自己的油菜上了没？莫说别人，先把自己的生产搞好哇！”确实，万登安自己生产没搞好，田里草跟庄稼一样高。他原来领导一个互助组，组员们怕耽误生产多了出不起工，互助组散了伙。后来这些互助组员又成立了一个互助组，单单没让他参加。万登安为这事气得哭了一大场。一九五一年，所有乡政府委员
    以上的干部的生产水平大都在群众一般生产水平以
    下。
    在一九五一年十二月间，县委发现了这个问题，
    就把乡的工作任务调整了一下，把当时摆在望城乡
    的冬学等“重点”都取消了（望城乡一直是县委指
    导工作的重点），强调一切工作结合生产去进行，让乡干部有时间参加生产，领导生产。但是，当时乡里机构仍然复杂，干部兼职仍然不少，要填的表格太多，乡干部仍然很少时间参加生产。到一九五二年五月间大农忙时，这些问题更显得突出了。县委当时进一步帮助改进了望城乡支部的领导工作，把乡里十三个机构减少到八个机构，一切工作由党支部统一领导、统一安排；减去了干部的兼职，不能减去的兼职就设了副职，乡主要干部实行了轮流值日办公制度；减少了会议。同时，在县级机关内控制了表格，不使随便下乡。所有乡村干部都参加生产，领导生产，参加互助，领导互助，并在全乡组织了五个互助网，交流生产经验。这样，群众不会因不必要的会议耽误生产，乡里主要干部也有充分时间参加生产了。他们参加生产的结果，不仅自己的生产搞好了，而且合乎自己在生产过程中摸索出的实际经验教育了群众，因而解除了不会领导生产的苦闷。乡支部副书记杨长荣参加并领导的互助组是全乡生产互助的旗帜。杨长荣如今十分明确
    “参加互助，领导互助”的重要，他说：“过去自己没参加互助，互助中到底有些什么问题，那是瞎子算命，乱说一气。现在算是有底了。”今年春天，望城乡整顿互助组贯彻互利政策首先是从杨长荣互助组做起的；他在自己互助组做好以后，又通过互助网把全乡都带动起来。如今五个主要乡干部全是互助组长，他们都反映：只有参加互助，领导互助才有“本钱”。这样，干部在群众中的威信也大大提高了。农民协会小组长万登安一九五一年生产落后，生活困难，说话群众不信，一九五二年秋后多增产粮食十多石，开个会还谈得出一套经验来，群众改变了对他的看法，转而积极拥护他，他当选了丰产模范，得到了丰产优胜红旗，在乡人民代表大会上，还被选为乡政委员会的委员。
    自从县委帮助望城乡改进领导工作以后，望城乡也并没有“排斥”生产以外的工作。民校、剧团等工作照样在乡里进行；但是，却没有影响生产。原因就是做到了由支部统一领导、统一安排。杨长荣感到这一点是望城乡一直以生产为中心工作，能纠正“五多”现象的重要保证。
    望城乡做到了纠正“五多”现象，扫除了生产中的障碍，每个角落都充满着积极生产的气氛，去年获得了丰收，被评为全县的红旗丰产乡。现在，望城乡党支部正热烈地讨论党中央“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”，进一步检查和改进领导方法。
