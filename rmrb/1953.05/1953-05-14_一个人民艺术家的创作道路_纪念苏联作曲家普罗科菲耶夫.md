An Artist's Creative Path for the People
-- In Memory of Soviet Composer Prokofiev
Zhao Feng

Editor's Note: The famous Soviet composer Prokofiev passed away on March 5th of this year. Beijing music workers will hold a memorial meeting on the 14th of this month. Prokofiev's creative career illustrates that only in the embrace of the motherland and the people can an artist's genius be fully developed. New China's music workers can learn from Prokofiev's life.

Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev was a Soviet composer, pianist, and conductor, a Stalin Prize laureate, and a People's Artist of the Russian Republic. He was born on April 23, 1891, and died on March 5, 1953.

Prokofiev demonstrated musical talent from an early age. In 1902, when he began studying harmony with Glière – a young composer who had just graduated from the conservatory – he wrote twelve piano pieces. In 1909, he completed Liadov's composition course at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, and in 1910 he won the Rubinstein Prize for piano competition. In 1914, he completed Eppova's piano course and studied composition and conducting with Rimsky-Korsakov and Tcherepnin. Since 1911, he began his creative life as a composer, pianist, and conductor.

The realistic traditions that Prokofiev's outstanding teachers passed on to him provided a healthy start to his creative activities. At that time, Russia was on the eve of revolution, and in art, it was also an era of "innovation." Impressionism in music went down the road of "trinkets," some "schools" played tricks on scales and harmonies, and some desperately moved towards mysticism. Prokofiev fiercely opposed these, but it was also during this period that the modernist elements in his own works were conceived.

His representative work from this period is the "Classical Symphony," written from 1916 to 1917. This is a small symphony, the charming tunes are decorated very perfectly, and "interest" is the main purpose pursued by the composer. The melody, structure, and even the dance movement, except for the harmony, are all in the style of Mozart, even the syntax of the melody is very similar to Mozart's music.

The first movement is allegro. It begins with the entire orchestra, with the strings playing a lively theme, while the wind instruments respond with a pleasant phrase of arpeggios. The brass instruments add to the momentum, ending brilliantly. The second movement is adagio. The strings play a peaceful, reminiscent theme, which is contradicted by a tense staccato phrase on the bass. The third movement is a gavotte, which can be said to be a classical minuet. The fourth movement is fast and lively, a brilliant allegro. Strings and woodwinds chase and imitate each other. This young composer opposed the novel methods of severing tradition by those pseudo-innovators and wrote this "archaizing" small symphony.

From 1918 to 1932, Prokofiev lived abroad. During the First World War, he lived in England; after the war, he went to the United States via Japan, and in 1922 he arrived in France. During this period, he appeared as a pianist and orchestra conductor, writing formalist works such as the ballet "The Age of Steel," "The Prodigal Son," and the operas "The Fiery Angel" and "The Love for Three Oranges." This was the result of his loss of contact with the motherland and the people. Even conservative British critics said that "as a composer, his works cannot be appreciated by the masses... his music is carefully calculated rather than appealing to the emotions, like some ingenious ornaments... full of physiological stimulation and tense effects..." (E. Blom).

During this period, his representative work should be "The Age of Steel." This work constantly features dissonant sounds, almost from beginning to end, loud and high-pitched sounds, and the phrases are full of spicy and quirky tones. This music attempts to describe the life of the Soviet people—also called "the ballet of work"—the labor and life of farms and factories. But it only uses noise to describe trains (the first movement of the suite) and factories (the fourth movement of the suite). This is a distortion of real life, because, as everyone knows, this is by no means a true depiction of the Soviet people's labor life. Here, he, like all sorts of modernists in music, is simply trying to "replace music with chaos."

But when Prokofiev returned to his motherland in 1932 and came into contact with the people of the motherland and socialist reality, his genius was fully developed. In 1936, he wrote the symphonic fairy tale "Peter and the Wolf," which is full of pure emotion and witty humor. In the same year, he wrote the ballet "Romeo and Juliet" based on Shakespeare's tragedy, vividly portraying the images of this pair of lovers. To this day, this ballet remains one of the repertoire programs on the Soviet stage. Due to the amazing creation of the outstanding dancer Ulanova, this ballet is even more brilliant. In 1939, Prokofiev wrote the passionate patriotic oratorio "Alexander Nevsky," which is a heroic narrative poem that uses Russian emotional folk tunes to portray the moving image and great spirit of the people's hero, recounting the 1242 battle on Lake Chud against the enemy by the patriotic people of Rus' (the ancient name for Russia) under the oppression of the Huns. The choir finally sang the heroic words: "In the motherland of Rus', no enemy has ever been able to stand his ground." In 1939, to celebrate Comrade Stalin's sixtieth birthday, Prokofiev wrote the oratorio "Hail to the Leader," expressing the Soviet people of all ethnic groups' respect and love for the leader. The author cleverly wove seven different national folk songs into a brilliant brocade.

With the help of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet people, Prokofiev overcame the bad influence of formalism. A series of modernist works he created from 1940 to 1948 (including the operas "Duennaya," "War and Peace," and "The Story of a Real Man") received serious and kind criticism from the people and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Prokofiev responded to the Party's concern and criticism with new works. In 1950, he wrote his outstanding oratorio "On Guard for Peace" based on the poems of the poet Marshak. As he himself confessed: "This theme was not found, nor was it chosen; it was born from my own boiling life, from me personally and from the things around other people... It tells of the difficult days of the Second World War, about the tears of mothers and orphans, about the flames of war that destroyed cities, and about the great test of our people. Its length tells of Stalingrad's victory over the enemy, the bright joy of labor construction, and the happy childhood given to our children. I have tried to tell my own thoughts about peace and about war. I firmly believe that war will not come, so all peoples must insist on peace, save civilization, save children, and save our future. This is how my oratorio 'On Guard for Peace' came into being."

This oratorio is divided into ten sections.

The first and second sections, "The Earth Has Just Awakened from the Roar of War" and "Who is Exactly Ten Years Old Today," depict the life during the Great Patriotic War: "The earth has just awakened, from the roar of war. Her forests, her land, have been burned and dug over. A pile of rubble; surviving chimneys; in the destroyed villages." "Today is a child who is exactly ten years old, he will remember the nights of the war, the lights not seen in the windows, they are all covered... Seven years ago, on the banks of the Volga River, in the middle of the flames, Stalingrad struck the enemy." The third section is: "Glorious City - Stalingrad": "The people rise from the ashes, from the destroyed collective farms, the train moves, the locomotive pulls the whistle." In the fourth section, "Use the Peace of the Earth as Medals for the Heroes," the orchestra and chorus sing: "The warriors of Stalingrad do not need long swords on museum tables." In the fifth section, the mezzo-soprano sings the most famous song of this oratorio: "Motherland Language Class": "In the comfortable, spacious church, in the quiet morning, the schoolchildren are busy: writing black letters on white paper, writing white letters on the blackboard, writing with pens and chalk: we don't want war. Stalingrad is under construction, our Moscow is under construction, on the blackboard and in the exercise books, the schoolchildren, the schoolchildren are learning to make sentences. In the morning sun, every letter is clear. The Soviet children are writing: 'All peoples of the world need peace, we don't want war! All peoples need peace, glory, wealth, and beauty!' That's how the Soviet children are learning the language." The sixth section is the already well-known "White Dove," accompanied by a clean orchestra and chorus: "From the neighbor's dovecote, the white dove flutters its wings; shining in the rosy clouds, bright, snow-like white. And, gathering so much brilliance; the soft white wings disappear from outside the window. It is our Moscow children, from the window of the attic, throwing the little dove into the sky like throwing a ball. This reminds us of the children in the cities and villages; the world yearns for peace, in this glorious summer day. In Paris and Shanghai, many pigeon keepers, at this same moment, throw pigeons into the sky. And the little pigeons, flying around the world; saying in the high sky: 'The warriors who defend peace, the warriors who defend peace; are more powerful than the war instigators.' It is our Moscow children, from the window of the attic, throwing the little dove into the sky like throwing a ball. This reminds us of the children in the cities and villages, they are blocking the way of war everywhere, the children's best friend is guiding them, he lives in the Kremlin." The seventh section, "Lullaby," is a lyrical mother's song, the mezzo-soprano solos a quiet and broad tune:

They are everywhere
Blocking the way of war
The children's best friend is guiding them
He lives in the Kremlin. The last three sections are "At the Peace Conference," "Dialogue of Gasoline," and
"The Whole World is Ready to Fight War with War" - these three consecutive articles create a powerful ending.

Prokofiev successfully wrote this sacred theme that concerns all the people of the world, and with unparalleled artistic persuasiveness, called on the people of the world to defend culture, defend children - against war, and defend peace.

Prokofiev's creative path is a tortuous creative path taken by an artist who is loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people. His genius was dimmed by the influence of formalism, but when he threw himself into the embrace of the motherland and the people, and listened to the voices of the motherland and the people, he broke through the thick fog of modernism and fully developed his genius. His brilliant works have enriched the treasure house of Soviet musical culture and world musical culture. This is of great educational significance for our musicians and artists.

    一个人民艺术家的创作道路
    ——纪念苏联作曲家普罗科菲耶夫
    赵沨
    编者按：苏联著名作曲家普罗科菲耶夫于本年三月五日逝世，北京音乐工作者定于本月十四日举行纪念会。普罗科菲耶夫的创作生涯说明了：只有在祖国和人民的怀抱里，艺术家的天才才能得到充分的发挥。新中国的音乐工作者可以从普罗科菲耶夫的一生得到教育。
    谢尔盖·赛尔该依维契·普罗科菲耶夫是苏联作曲家，钢琴家和指挥家，斯大林奖金获奖人，俄罗斯共和国人民艺术家。一八九一年四月二十三日生，一九五三年三月五日逝世。
    普罗科菲耶夫自幼年起便显出了音乐创作的才能。一九○二年，他跟格里埃尔——刚自音乐院毕业的年青作曲家开始学和声时，便写了十二首钢琴曲。一九○九年，他在彼得堡音乐院修完了利亚多夫的作曲课，一九一○年以钢琴竞奏乐获罗平斯坦奖。一九一四年，他修完了艾波娃的钢琴课，并跟里姆斯基·可沙可夫，车列普宁学作曲和指挥。自一九一一年起，他作为作曲家、钢琴家和指挥家，开始了他的创作生活。
    普罗科菲耶夫的杰出的教师们传授给他的现实主义的传统，使他的创作活动有一个健康的开端。当时俄罗斯正处在革命的前夜，在艺术上，那也是“革新”的年代。音乐上的印象派走上了“小摆设儿”的路，有的“学派”便在音阶和和声上耍花样，有的绝望地走向神秘主义。普罗科菲耶夫激烈地反对这些，但也正在这个时期，孕育了他自己作品中现代主义的因素。
    这个时期他的代表作是一九一六至一九一七年写的“古典交响乐”，这是一个小交响乐，媚人的曲调被装饰得非常完美，“兴味”是作曲家追求的主旨。曲调、结构以至那舞曲的乐章，除了和声，一切都是莫差尔特风的，甚至连曲调的句法，也非常神似莫差尔特的音乐。
    第一乐章是快板。开始于管弦乐全体，弦乐奏出一个生气勃勃的主题，而管乐用一个分解和弦的愉快的句子对应着。铜管助长着气势，辉煌地收场。第二乐章是慢板。弦乐奏出一个安详的，回忆的主题，低音上一个紧张的断奏的句子与之矛盾着。第三乐章是嘉禾舞曲，可以说是古典的小步舞曲。第四乐章快而有生气，一个光辉的快板。弦乐和木管追逐着，模仿着。这个年青的作曲家反对那些伪革新家们割裂传统的新奇手法，写了这个“拟古”风的小交响乐。
    一九一八至一九三二年，普罗科菲耶夫侨居国外。第一次世界大战期间，他住在英国；战争结束后，他道经日本到美国，一九二二年到了法国。在这个时期，他以钢琴家和乐队指挥的身分出现，写了舞剧“钢铁时代”、“浪子”、歌剧“火的天使”、“三个橘子的恋爱”等形式主义的作品。这便是他失去了与祖国和人民的联系的结果。连保守的英国批评家也说他“作为一个作曲家，他的作品不是群众能够欣赏的……他的音乐是精心计算出来的而不是诉诸心底的感情的，像一些匠心刻划的饰物……充满着生理的刺激和紧张的效果……”
    （E·布洛姆）。
    这个时期，他的代表作品应是“钢铁时代”。这个作品不时出现着不谐和的声音，差不多自始至终是响亮高吭的音响，乐句中充满着辛辣和乖僻的音调。这个音乐是企图描写苏维埃人民的生活的——又叫作“工作的舞剧”——农场和工矿的劳动和生活。但它只用噪音来描写火车（组曲第一首）和工厂（组曲第四首）。这是对真实生活的歪曲，因为，谁也知道，这决不是苏维埃人民的劳动生活的真实描绘。在这里，他和音乐上各种各样现代主义者完全一样，只是企图“用混乱代替音乐”。
    但当普罗科菲耶夫在一九三二年回到了祖国，与祖国的人民和社会主义实际相接触以后，他的天才便得到充分的发展。一九三六年他写了交响乐童话“彼得和狼”，充满着纯真的感情和智慧的谐趣。同年，他根据莎士比亚的悲剧写了舞剧“罗米欧和朱丽叶”，鲜明地刻划了这一对情侣的形象。直到今天，这舞剧仍是苏联舞台上的保留节目之一。由于卓越的舞蹈家乌兰诺娃的惊人创造，这个舞剧更显得光辉灿烂。一九三九年，普罗科菲耶夫写了热烈的爱国主义的清唱剧“亚历山大·涅夫斯基”，这是一首英雄的叙事诗，用俄罗斯富于感情的民间曲调刻划了人民英雄的动人形象和伟大气概，叙述了一二四二年在匈奴人的压迫下的罗斯
    （俄罗斯的古称）爱国人民在楚德湖上和敌人大战的情景。合唱团最后唱出了英雄的豪语：“在罗斯祖国，从来没有敌人能站得住脚”。一九三九年，为了祝贺斯大林同志六十寿辰，普罗科菲耶夫写了清唱剧“万寿无疆”，表现了苏联各族人民对领袖的敬爱。作者巧妙地把七首不同民族的民歌织成一块灿烂的锦绣。
    在联共（布）和苏联人民的帮助下，普罗科菲耶夫克服了形式主义的恶劣影响。他在一九四○到一九四八年所创作的一连串现代主义的作品（包括歌剧“杜恩尼亚”、“战争与和平”和“真实人的故事”），受到人民和联共（布）中央的严正而亲切的批评。普罗科菲耶夫用新的作品回答了党对他的关切的批评。一九五零年，他根据诗人马尔沙克的诗篇，写了他的杰出的清唱剧“保卫和平”。正如他自己表白的：“这个主题不是找来的，也不是选上的，是从自己的沸腾的生活中出生的，来自我个人和其他人们周围的事物之中。……它叙述了第二次世界大战时期的艰辛日子，关于母亲和孤儿的眼泪，关于毁灭城镇的战火，和对于我国人民的伟大的考验。它的篇幅中叙说了斯大林格勒战胜敌人，劳动建设的光辉的愉快，和给予我们儿童以幸福的童年。我努力述说了自己对于和平和对于战争的想头，我深信，战争不会到来，那就要各族人民坚持和平，拯救文明、拯救儿童和我们的将来。就这样产生了我的清唱剧‘保卫和平’”。
    这个清唱剧分十个段落。
    第一和第二段是“大地刚刚从战争的轰鸣中苏醒”和“今天谁正是十岁”，描绘了伟大的祖国战争时期的生活：“大地刚刚苏醒，从战争的轰鸣中。她的森林，她的土地，烧毁了，掘翻了。一片瓦砾；残存的烟囱；在被毁灭的村庄里。”“今天正是十岁的孩子，他会想起战争的夜晚，窗口上看不见灯火，它们全被遮盖起来……在七年以前，在伏尔加河岸，在火焰中间，斯大林格勒打击着敌人。”第三段是：“光荣的城市——斯大林格勒”：“人民从灰烬中站起来，从被毁的集体农庄，列车驰动，机车拉着响笛。”在第四段“用大地的和平来作为英雄们的奖章”里，管弦乐和合唱歌颂着：“斯大林格勒的勇士们不需要博物馆桌案上的长剑”。到了第五段，女中音唱出了这清唱剧中最有名的歌曲：“祖国语言课”：“在舒适、广阔的教堂，寂静的清晨，小学生们忙碌着：在白纸上写着黑字，在黑板上写着白字，用钢笔和粉笔写着：我们不要战争。斯大林格勒正在进行建设，正在建设着我们的莫斯科，在黑板上和在练习簿上，小学生们，小学生们在学习着造句。在早晨的阳光中每个字母都清清楚楚。苏联的孩子们写着：‘全世界各民族人民需要和平，我们不需要战争！全世界各民族需要和平、光辉、富裕和美丽！’苏联的孩子们就这样学习着语言。”第六段是已经家弦户诵的“白鸽”，由光洁的管弦乐伴随着合唱：“从邻家的鸽楼中，白鸽振翅飞起来了；在霞光中闪耀着，光鲜的，雪也似的洁白。而，聚集那么多的光辉；轻柔的洁白的翅膀自窗外消失了。这是我们莫斯科的儿童，从阁楼的窗口，像抛皮球一样，把小鸽子抛向天空。这使我们想起，城市和乡村的儿童；世界渴望着和平，在这光荣的夏天的日子里。在巴黎和上海，很多养鸽子的人们，在这同一的瞬间，把鸽子抛向天空。而小鸽子们，在世界各地飞翔；在高空中说：‘保卫和平的战士，保卫和平的战士；比战争挑拨者更有力量。’这是我们莫斯科的儿童，从阁楼的窗口，像抛皮球一样，把小鸽子抛向天空。这使我们想起，城市和乡村的儿童，他们到处都挡住了战争的去路，孩子们最好的朋友引导着他们，他住在克里姆林宫。”第七段“摇篮曲”，是一首抒情的母亲的歌，女中音独唱出安静和宽广的曲调：
    他们到处都
    挡住了战争的去路
    孩子们最好的朋友引导着他们
    他住在克里姆林宫。最后的三段是“在和平大会”、“汽油的对话”和
    “全世界准备用战争对付战争”——这连续的三篇造成一个有力的收场。
    普罗科菲耶夫成功地写了这一个全世界人民都关切的神圣的主题，并以无比的艺术的说服力，号召世界人民保卫文化，保卫儿童——反对战争，保卫和平。
    普罗科菲耶夫的创作道路，是一个忠于祖国、忠于人民的艺术家所走的曲折的创作道路。他的天才在形式主义的影响下黯淡无光，但当他投入祖国和人民的怀抱，倾听祖国和人民的声音时，便冲破了现代主义的浓雾，充分发挥了他的天才。他的辉煌的作品丰富了苏维埃音乐文化和世界音乐文化的宝库。这对于我们的音乐家、艺术家来说，是有很大教育意义的。
