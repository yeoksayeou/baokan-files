Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th - The arduous project of the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway, the Chengdu-Lueyang section, is underway on the precipitous Shu Road. The roadbed for the Chengdu-Mianyang section, 118 kilometers in length, has been completed, and the bridge and culvert construction work has also been basically completed. Tracklaying began on April 27th.

The construction of the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway began last year when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway opened to traffic on July 1st. Over the past ten months, tens of thousands of railway workers, military engineers, and civilian laborers have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "continue to work hard to build the Tiancheng Railway," conquering the turbulent rivers along the route to build large bridges, and blasting tunnels through the high mountains and cliffs of the Daba Mountains. In their struggle against the particularly hard rock, the workers created the "central blasting method" and the "saltwater drill bit method," which accelerated the progress of the project.

    天成路成都绵阳段开始铺轨
    【新华社成都三十日电】天成铁路南段成都略阳段的艰巨工程正在千山万水的蜀道上进行。其中成都到绵阳段的一百一十八公里路基已经修好，桥梁涵渠安砌工程也已基本上完工，四月二十七日已开始铺轨。
    天成铁路南段的筑路工程，是在去年“七一”成渝铁路通车时开始动工的。十个月来，几万个铁路职工、军工、民工积极响应毛主席“继续努力修筑天成路”的号召，征服沿线湍急的河流建筑大桥，穿过大巴山脉的高山绝壁开凿隧道。工人们在和特别坚硬的石头作斗争中创造了“中心放炮法”、“盐水沾钎法”，加速了工程进度。
