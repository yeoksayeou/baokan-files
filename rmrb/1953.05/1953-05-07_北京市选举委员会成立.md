    The Beijing Municipal Election Committee was established on the 6th and held its first plenary session. The Election Committee is chaired by Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with Jiang Guangnai, Wu Han, Feng Binfu, Peng Zemin, Sun Xiaocun, Xue Yu, Li Leguang, Zhang Dazhong, Feng Peizhi, Chai Zemin, Zhang Xiaomei, Shu Sheyu, Wang Chun, Fu Huating, Qian Duansheng, She Diqing, Du Ruo, Ma Yuhuai, Zai Tao, and Liu Fu as members.
    At the meeting, Chai Zemin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, reported on the preparations for the election and discussed matters such as the establishment of the Election Committee Office.
    Since the Central People's Government Committee resolved to convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, Beijing has actively carried out various preparatory tasks. After the promulgation of the Election Law, investigations were immediately conducted in key streets, a draft of the implementing regulations for the Election Law was drawn up, and a plan for the division of townships in suburban rural areas has also been drafted. Under the leadership of the Election Committee, the training of election cadres, election experiments, and township division experiments will soon begin. (Xinhua News Agency)
