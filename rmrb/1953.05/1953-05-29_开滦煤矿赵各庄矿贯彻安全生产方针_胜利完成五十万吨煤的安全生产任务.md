Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, May 28th: The "Tangshan Labor Daily" reports that the Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhaogezhuang Mine has successfully completed its 500,000-ton safe production task. This is the result of the mine's employees implementing the safe production policy. The mine has now proposed a new goal of one million tons of safe production.

The Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhaogezhuang Mine launched the 500,000-ton safe production campaign on January 16th and successfully completed it on May 19th. During the campaign, fatal accidents were eliminated, serious injuries decreased by 50% compared to the past, and minor injuries decreased by 11.75%. In terms of roof management, technical personnel and workers combined their efforts to initially grasp the changing patterns of the most difficult-to-control No. 7 and No. 9 roofs, eliminating all accidents that destroyed the working face. The main work types – coal cutting, pillar setting, pillar removal, drivers, hook operators, and blasters – all revised and implemented operating procedures, focused on promoting the "three notebooks" system, and established systems for electromechanical maintenance, gas inspection, and ventilation management. Ash content and timber consumption were significantly reduced. With the improvement of safety conditions, the mine began to complete its production plan in a balanced manner starting in April.

On May 25th, the Zhaogezhuang Mine held a celebration meeting to commemorate the victory. Representatives from the North China Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Coal Mine Management General Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and other units attended and presented the mine's employees with award banners. The Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration Office awarded the mine's employees a safe production bonus of 50 million yuan. At the meeting, the employees of the Zhaogezhuang Mine put forward the slogan "Strive to achieve the one-million-ton safe production task," aiming to complete the production task in a balanced manner on a monthly basis, ensure that everyone strictly implements safe production operating procedures, eliminate fatal accidents, strive to eliminate serious injuries, and reduce minor injuries by one-quarter.

The reason why the Zhaogezhuang Mine was able to successfully complete the 500,000-ton safe production task is that the leadership established the idea of the unity of safety and production, and criticized the erroneous saying that deaths are inevitable in coal mine production. Then, on the basis of a major safety inspection, combined with the anti-accident struggle, a mass movement was launched to implement technical operating procedures and safety regulations, and the implementation of production plans and the implementation of operating procedures were unified in each worker group. They also learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, implemented the "three notebooks" system, and strengthened production management. This allowed workers to act in accordance with operating procedures, and production management had people in charge and timely guidance, which further guaranteed safe production. The unity of thought and action of the mine's Party, government, labor union, and youth league, all treating production safety as the overriding central task, was also an important reason for the completion of the task.

    开滦煤矿赵各庄矿贯彻安全生产方针
    胜利完成五十万吨煤的安全生产任务
    【新华社唐山二十八日电】此间“唐山劳动日报”消息：开滦煤矿赵各庄矿胜利完成五十万吨安全生产任务。这是该矿职工贯彻安全生产方针的结果，现在该矿又提出百万吨安全生产的奋斗目标。
    开滦煤矿赵各庄矿于一月十六日开展五十万吨安全生产运动，五月十九日胜利完成。运动中消灭了死亡事故，重伤比以前减少了百分之五十、轻伤减少了百分之十一点七五。在顶板管理上，技术人员和工人相结合，初步掌握了最难控制的七槽和九槽顶板的变化规律，消灭了全部切毁工作面的事故。主要工种——刨煤、支柱、回柱、司机、把钩、炮工等都修订并贯彻了操作规程，重点地推行三种簿子制度，并建立了机电维修、检查瓦斯和风量等制度，灰分和坑木消耗都显著减少。随着安全情况的好转，该矿从四月份开始做到均衡地完成生产计划。
    赵各庄矿全矿职工在五月二十五日召开了庆祝胜利大会，中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局华北煤矿管理局、中共唐山市委等单位代表出席向该矿全体职工发奖旗，开滦煤矿总管理处发给该矿职工安全生产奖金五千万元。会上，赵各庄矿职工又提出“为争取实现百万吨安全生产任务而奋斗”的口号，要作到按月均衡完成生产任务，保证人人严格执行安全生产操作规程，消灭死亡事故，争取消灭重伤，轻伤减少四分之一。
    赵各庄矿所以能够胜利完成五十万吨安全生产任务，是因为领导上树立了安全与生产统一的思想，批判了煤矿生产难免死人的错误说法。然后在安全大检查的基础上，结合反事故斗争，开展了贯彻技术操作规程和保安规程的群众运动，在各工人小组中，把执行生产计划和执行操作规程统一起来。他们又学习苏联的先进经验，实行了三种簿子制度，加强了生产管理。这样工人能按操作规程办事，生产管理上有人负责、指导及时，使安全生产有了进一步的保证。该矿党、政、工、团思想统一、步骤统一，都把生产安全作为压倒一切的中心工作，也是完成任务的重要原因。
