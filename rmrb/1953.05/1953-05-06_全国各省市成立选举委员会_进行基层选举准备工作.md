Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: Preparation work for grassroots elections is proceeding intensely throughout the country. Up to now, election committees have been established in all forty-two provinces and cities nationwide (excluding the Tibet region). Election committees at the county (city) level under the jurisdiction of each province have also been largely established.

Various localities are successively holding meetings to specifically arrange election work. At its second meeting on April 28th, the Northeast Administrative Committee discussed in detail the work plan for grassroots elections in the entire region. In order to adapt to the agricultural production season in the Northeast region and facilitate leadership, the meeting decided to conduct the grassroots election work in two steps and to separate the election times for urban and rural areas. The entire region will begin in mid-May, using a "combination of centralized training and pilot projects" method to train election work cadres. Sichuan Province held a preparatory meeting for grassroots elections on April 27th, studying the training of cadres and population surveys in various counties (cities) of the province. Jiangxi Province and Ningxia Province recently held civil affairs work conferences and election work symposiums respectively. In addition to discussing election work plans, the cadres attending the meeting also concentrated on studying the documents related to grassroots elections promulgated by the Central Election Committee. The Jiangsu Province Election Committee has preliminarily discussed the steps for grassroots election work and decided to convene a joint meeting of chairmen of election committees from all counties (cities) in the province in early May to specifically arrange grassroots election work in the province.

The "Election Work Handbook" compiled and printed by the Central Election Committee began to be distributed to election committees at all levels at the beginning of this month to supply work cadres for study and publicity. The Hunan Province Election Committee has printed and distributed popular election documents to the counties. The committee is also stepping up the printing of voter registration forms and voter cards.

Various localities are starting to conduct pilot work for grassroots elections in order to gain experience. The Guangdong Province Election Committee has transferred more than 120 cadres to form a work team, which went to Yingde County in the Yuebei District on May 3rd to conduct pilot work for the general election. The Shandong Province Election Committee has selected one township in each special district and one district each in Jinan and Qingdao to conduct pilot projects. Sichuan Province has recently also sent a grassroots election experimental work team to Jiangjin County for key experiments. Wuhan City is preparing to select four types of areas—an industrial area, a commercial area, an area where government offices are concentrated, and a township in the suburbs—to conduct popular election experiments.

    全国各省市成立选举委员会
    进行基层选举准备工作
    【新华社五日讯】各地基层选举的准备工作正在紧张进行中。迄至目前止，全国四十二个省、市
    （西藏地区在外）已全部成立了选举委员会。各省所属县（市）的选举委员会也已大部建立。
    各地正相继举行会议，具体部署选举工作。东北行政委员会在上月二十八日召开的第二次会议上，详细讨论了全区基层选举工作计划。为了适应东北地区农村生产季节和便于领导，会议决定将基层选举工作分做两个步骤进行，并将城市和农村的选举时间分开。全区将从五月中旬开始，采用“集中训练与试点相结合”的办法进行选举工作干部的训练。四川省在上月二十七日举行了基层选举准备工作会议，研究了全省各县（市）训练干部和人口调查等问题。江西省和宁夏省最近分别举行了民政工作会议和选举工作座谈会，除讨论选举工作计划外，到会的干部还都集中学习了中央选举委员会颁布的有关基层选举的文件。江苏省选举委员会已初步商讨了基层选举工作的步骤，并决定在本月上旬召开全省各县（市）选举委员会主席联席会议，具体布置全省的基层选举工作。
    中央选举委员会编印的“选举工作手册”已在本月初开始分发给各级选举委员会，供给工作干部学习和进行宣传。湖南省选举委员会已印行了普选文件，分发到县。该会并正在加紧印制选民登记表和选民证。
    各地正开始进行基层选举的试点工作，以便取得经验。广东省选举委员会抽调了一百二十多个干部，组成工作队，已在本月三日前往粤北区英德县进行普选试点工作。山东省选举委员会已在每一专区选择一个乡，在济南、青岛两市各选择一个区进行试点。四川省最近也已派出一个基层选举试验工作组，前往江津县作重点试验。武汉市准备选择四种区域——工业区、商业区、机关聚集区和郊区一个乡进行普选试验。
