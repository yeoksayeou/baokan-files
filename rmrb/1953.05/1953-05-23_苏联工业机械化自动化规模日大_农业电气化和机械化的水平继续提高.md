According to Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet Union's various industrial sectors are implementing the complete mechanization and automation of production processes on an ever-expanding scale to improve labor productivity and reduce workers' labor. There are thirty-nine types of automatic machine devices in the Soviet machine-building industry for producing parts for automatic vehicles, tractors, agricultural machines, etc. In various machine factories, especially fully automated factories, the overall mechanization of automatic devices and workshops has reached its maximum scale. Automatic devices increase labor productivity by an average of ten to fifteen times. As early as 1951, the Soviet Union's output of automatic unloading trucks increased to 5.8 times the total output during the three pre-war five-year plan periods, automatic mobile cranes increased by 4.2 times, and excavators increased by 21 percent. In the mining industry, a few years ago, the machines mainly used by Soviet coal miners for coal mining were coal cutters and pneumatic picks. Now, coal mining combines, loading machines, powerful conveyor belts, electric locomotives, and other machines are widely used in tunnels. In iron and steel industrial enterprises, heat treatment, metallurgy, and other operations in blast furnace and open hearth furnace workshops have been completely mechanized and are automatically controlled. The construction of huge hydropower stations such as Kuibyshev and Stalingrad provides a brilliant example of comprehensive mechanization. Not long ago, a highly efficient mud suction machine was used on the construction site of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. It could suck 300 to 500 cubic meters of mud per hour and move the mud to a place two or three kilometers away. Now, a new type of mud suction machine has been adopted on the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, which can move 1,000 cubic meters of mud per hour to a place four kilometers away. In the light industry sector, since the end of the Great Patriotic War, a total of 170,000 new machine tools and textile machines have been installed in various light industrial sectors in the Soviet Union. The old-fashioned looms in weaving factories have been replaced by automatic looms. As a result, the labor productivity of textile workers can be increased by 50 to 100 percent.

The Soviet Union is widely applying a new construction method of pre-assembling wall and floor building components, which reduces labor consumption by 30 to 40 percent, greatly reduces construction costs, improves work quality, and shortens the time required for construction work. Currently, Moscow is building forty-six enterprises that manufacture building materials and components.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 14th: Pravda recently published an article by N. Semenov, a Soviet engineer and winner of the Stalin Prize, discussing the automation and remote control of Soviet railway transportation.

Semenov wrote: During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, new and more advanced remote automatic control equipment will be widely used on Soviet railway lines. This equipment has been tested during operation with good results. One of these devices is called a selective automatic block system, which does not require special wires to connect the signal and automatic stop equipment. Before the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union had already installed an automatic parking device designed by engineer Tanchurul, winner of the Stalin Prize, on thousands of kilometers of track. This device replaces the wayside signal in front of the locomotive with a signal in the driver's cab. Now, Soviet engineers have designed a continuous automatic parking device. This device is to install a small light signal in the driver's cab so that the driver can clearly see the situation of the track ahead. This new device enables trains to run safely in heavy snow, heavy fog, and storms, and in any weather conditions that may reduce visibility.

Radio communication for controlling railway traffic will be greatly expanded. Radio stations specially designed for operation in railway stations have been tested in hundreds of large marshalling yards across the country. This radio station ensures reliable radio communication between the dispatcher and the shunting locomotive driver or brakeman. With the organization of in-station radio communication, it is easier to solve the problem of establishing radio communication between the dispatcher, the station duty officer, and the driver.

[Xinhua News Agency, 20th] The scale of agricultural electrification and mechanization in the Soviet Union continues to expand. According to TASS: The Soviet Union is currently building rural power stations on a large scale. Some of these power stations are built by the state, and some are built by collective farms. Many rural power stations built in the Soviet Union in the past few years have a much larger generating capacity than those built before the war. Some rural power stations have a generating capacity of 2,000 to 3,000 kilowatts, which is enough to supply dozens of collective farms. In the central states of the Soviet Union, in the Urals and Siberia, and in the republics of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia, etc., many large rural power stations have been established for the joint use of several collective farms. New rural power stations are completed in the Soviet Union every year. For example, four huge rural power stations have recently been completed and put into operation in the Almaty and South Kazakhstan regions of the Kazakh Republic. This year, twenty-three new rural power stations will be put into operation in the Belarusian Republic, and their power generation will be twice that of the power stations established last year. The continuous establishment of rural power stations has greatly developed rural electrification. In 1952, the electricity used in agricultural production in the Soviet Union was about four times that before the war. Now, some regions in the Soviet Union are implementing 100% agricultural electrification.

The level of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union is constantly improving. In Kuban, a famous grain-producing area in the Soviet Union, there were only 9.6 horsepower machines used per 100 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of cultivated land before the war in 1940. Now, the horsepower of the machines used has reached 17.7 horsepower. In many collective farms and state farms in Kuban, some work has been almost completely mechanized. Agricultural mechanization in the Ukrainian Republic has greatly developed. Now, the total working capacity of the tractor fleet of machine tractor stations has increased by 45 percent compared with 1950, and the total working capacity of combine harvesters has more than doubled. Powerful crawler diesel tractors have replaced the old tractors, and the old grain combine harvesters have also been replaced by the more efficient "Stalin-6" and self-propelled combines. Collective farmers have widely used the latest agricultural machines to sow grains, beets, corn, potatoes, sunflowers, and other crops in this year's spring plowing, greatly reducing laborious work.

    苏联工业机械化自动化规模日大
    农业电气化和机械化的水平继续提高
    据新华社讯：苏联各工业部门正在日益扩大的规模上实行生产过程的全部机械化和自动化，以提高劳动生产率和减轻工人的劳动。苏联机器制造工业中有三十九种自动机器装置，来生产自动车辆、拖拉机、农业机器等的部件。在各个机器工厂、特别是充分自动化了的工厂，自动装置和车间的全盘机械化已达到了最大的规模。自动装置使劳动生产率平均增加为过去的十倍到十五倍。远在一九五一年，苏联自动卸货卡车的产量就增加为战前三个五年计划时期的产量总和的五点八倍，自动移动起重机增加为四点二倍，掘凿机增加百分之二十一。在采矿业方面，几年以前，苏联煤矿工人采煤时使用的机器主要是割煤机和风镐。现在，地道中广泛地使用着采煤联合机、装石机、效力强大的输送带、电气机车和其他机器。在钢铁工业企业中，高炉和平炉车间的热处理、冶金及其他操作都已完全机械化，而且是自动操纵的。古比雪夫、斯大林格勒等巨大的水电站的建筑，提供了全面机械化的一个光辉范例。不久以前，列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑工地上曾使用过一种效率很高的吸泥机。它每小时可以吸泥三百到五百立方公尺，并把泥土移到二、三公里以外的地方去。现在，古比雪夫水电站的建筑工地上采取了一种新的吸泥机，它每小时能够把一千立方公尺的泥土移到四公里以外的地方。在轻工业方面，自从伟大的卫国战争结束以来，苏联各轻工业部门中共装置了十七万台新的工作母机和纺织机。织布工厂中的旧式织布机，已为自动织布机所代替了。结果，纺织工人的劳动生产率可以提高百分之五十到一百。
    苏联广泛地应用着一种预先装配墙壁和地板的建筑部件的新建筑方法，使劳动消耗量减低了百分之三十到四十，并大大地减低了建筑成本，改进了工作质量，缩短了建筑工作所需的时间。现在，莫斯科正在建设四十六个制造建筑材料和部件的企业。
    据新华社十四日讯：真理报最近刊载了斯大林奖金得奖人、苏联工程师纳·谢麦诺夫的一篇文章，论述苏联铁路运输的自动化和远距离操纵问题。
    谢麦诺夫写道：在第五个五年计划期间，苏联铁路线上将广泛使用新的、更完善的远距离自动控制设备。这种设备已在行车期间经过试验，成绩良好。这些设备中有一种叫做选号式自动闭塞装置，这种装置不需要专门联接信号器和自动停止设备的电线。在第四个五年计划结束以前，苏联就已在长达几千公里的路轨上装置了斯大林奖金得奖人、坦楚乌尔工程师所设计的一种自动停车装置。这种装置就是以司机室的信号器代替机车前面相当距离的路旁信号器。现在，苏联工程师更设计了一种连续自动停车设备。这种设备就是在司机室内设置一种很小的灯光信号器，使司机能够看清楚前面路轨的情况。这种新装置使火车在大雪、大雾和暴风雨中，以及在任何可以缩小视界的气候条件下，都能安全行驶。
    用来控制铁路交通的无线电通讯将大大扩充。为在火车站内操使而专门设计的无线电台，已在全国几百个大调车场经过试验。这种电台保证调度员和调车机车司机员或制动员之间的无线电通讯确实可靠。有了站内无线电通讯的组织，就便于解决调度员和值班站长以及司机之间建立无线电通讯的问题。
    【新华社二十日讯】苏联农业电气化和机械化的规模继续扩大。据塔斯社消息：苏联目前正在大规模建设农村电力站。这些电力站有的由国家建造，有的由集体农庄建造。战后几年中苏联所建造的许多农村电力站，它们的发电能力都比战前建造的大得多。有些农村电力站的发电能力为二、三千瓩，生产的电力足够几十个集体农庄使用。在苏联中部各州，在乌拉尔和西伯利亚，在乌克兰、哈萨克、格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚等共和国，都建立了许多座几个集体农庄共同使用的大型的农村电力站。每年苏联都有新的农村电力站落成。例如，哈萨克共和国的阿拉木图州和南哈萨克州等地，最近就有四座巨大的农村电力站落成发电。今年，白俄罗斯共和国将有二十三座新的农村电力站发电，它们的发电量将为去年建立的电力站的两倍。农村电力站的陆续建立，已使农村电气化工作获得很大的发展。一九五二年苏联用在农业生产上的电力约为战前的四倍。现在，苏联有些地区正在实行百分之百的农业电气化。
    苏联农业机械化的水平正在不断提高。苏联著名的产谷区库班在战前一九四○年，平均每一百公顷
    （每公顷合十五亩）的耕地只有九点六匹马力的机器使用，现在使用的机器的马力已达到了十七点七匹马力。库班许多集体农庄和国营农场有些工作几乎已全部机械化。乌克兰共和国的农业机械化工作有很大的发展。现在，机器拖拉机站的拖拉机队的工作总能力比一九五○年增加了百分之四十五，联合收割机的工作总能力增加了一倍多。效能强大的履带式柴油拖拉机已代替了老式的拖拉机，老式的谷物联合收割机也被效率更高的“斯大林—六号”和自动推进联合机所代替。集体农民在今年的春耕工作中，广泛使用了最新式的农业机器来播种谷物、甜菜、玉蜀黍、马铃薯、向日葵及其他作物，使费力劳动大大地减轻了。
