Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 20th: A mass rally held in Hyde Park, London, on May 17th, unanimously demanded an immediate end to the Korean War and an end to the tactics of US General Harrison. The London "Daily Worker" said: The rally was organized by the British Veterans' Movement for Peace.
The British Association of Scientific Workers, at its annual council meeting held last weekend, unanimously urged the government to use all its strength to promote the realization of an armistice in Korea. Another unanimously passed resolution called for the lifting of restrictions on East-West trade and the abolition of the US Battle Act, and particularly expressed regret over the British government's ban on selling antibacterial drugs to China.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 21st: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 15th, exposing the US government's tricks to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. The editorial said that the US rulers first stated that whether the negotiations could succeed was a "test of the sincerity" of the socialist countries' desire for peace, and then they demanded that the Korean and Chinese sides accept Washington's conditions as a "proof" of sincerity. "But the Pentagon then put forward conditions that required the Korean and Chinese side to completely abandon the principle of repatriation of prisoners of war stipulated in the Geneva Convention and other international laws."

The editorial continued: "Obviously, the Korean and Chinese side cannot accept the Pentagon's conditions without completely abandoning the position they have defended for a year and a half. Because the 'new' Eisenhower plan is not about repatriating prisoners of war, but about permanently detaining these prisoners of war and handing them over to the Syngman Rhee gang."

The editorial said: "Therefore, it is clear that the Pentagon's conditions are a trick, attempting to obstruct the realization of an armistice, thereby giving the Eisenhower government a new excuse to refuse to participate in a summit conference of major powers to discuss other issues."

The editorial expressed agreement with the recent statement by British Labour Party leader Attlee that some people in the United States hope to wage a full-scale war with China, and it said that the "China lobby" represents these people.

The "Daily Worker" then emphasized: "But these people can be defeated. Their conspiracy to continue the killings in Korea and to worsen our relations with the people of other countries can be shattered." The "Daily Worker" called on all unions and all Americans who generally desire peace to speak out loudly and "strive for the realization of an armistice in Korea before the opportunity is taken away."

    伦敦举行群众大会要求立即结束朝鲜战争
    纽约“工人日报”斥责美政府阻挠停战谈判
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】五月十七日在伦敦海德公园召开的群众大会，一致要求立即结束朝鲜战争，结束美国的哈利逊将军的策略。伦敦“工人日报”说：大会是由英国退伍军人保卫和平运动协会所组织的。
    英国科学工作者协会在上周末举行的理事会年会一致敦促政府用全部力量促进朝鲜停战的实现。另外一个一致通过的决议，要求撤销东西方贸易的限制和取消美国的巴特尔法，特别对英国政府禁止把抗菌药物卖给中国表示遗憾。
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】纽约“工人日报”十五日发表社论，揭露美国政府玩弄花样来破坏朝鲜停战谈判。社论说，美国统治者首先表示谈判能否成功是社会主义国家和平愿望是否有“诚意的考验”，然后他们又要求朝中方面接受华盛顿的条件以作为诚意的“证明”。“但是五角大楼接着提出了条件，这些条件需要朝中方面完全放弃日内瓦公约和其它国际法所规定的遣返战俘原则。”
    社论继续说：“显然，朝中方面不完全放弃他们一年半以来所保卫的立场，是不能接受五角大楼的条件的。因为‘新的’艾森豪威尔计划并不是遣返战俘，而是要永久扣留这些战俘，把他们交给李承晚匪帮”。
    社论说：“因此，显然，五角大楼的条件是一种花样，企图阻挠实现停战，从而给予艾森豪威尔政府新的藉口以拒绝参加大国最高级会议，讨论其它问题。”
    社论表示同意英国工党领袖艾德礼最近所说美国有些人希望与中国进行全面战争，它说，“运动援华的院外集团”就是代表这些人说话的。
    “工人日报”接着强调说：“但是这些人是能够加以击败的。他们使朝鲜杀戮继续下去，使我们与其它国家人民的关系恶化的阴谋是能够加以粉碎的。”“工人日报”要求各工会和所有一般希望和平的美国人大声疾呼，“在机会被夺走以前争取实现朝鲜停战”。
