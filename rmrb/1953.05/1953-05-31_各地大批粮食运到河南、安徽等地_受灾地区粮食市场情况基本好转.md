    Large Quantities of Grain from Various Regions Shipped to Henan, Anhui, and Other Places
    Grain Market Situation in Disaster Areas Basically Improved

[Xinhua News Agency, May 30th] In the past month, large quantities of grain from all over the country have been continuously shipped to disaster areas such as Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong. The tense situation that once appeared in the grain markets of these regions has now basically improved, and grain prices have stabilized.

Large quantities of grain began to arrive in Henan successively in April. After widespread rainfall in Henan on May 20th, the sales figures for grain in various counties and towns decreased by 10%, with some decreasing by as much as 29%. The price of wheat and sorghum in the Shangqiu Special District fell by 200 to 300 yuan per jin, approaching a reasonable price. In the primary markets of the Shangqiu Special District in eastern Henan and parts of southern Henan, wealthier farmers are selling aged wheat, and state-owned grain departments have already purchased some. New barley has come onto the market in Luoyang and Xinyang Special Districts, and the summer harvest is about to begin, with farmers turning to production. Recently, at the primary market material exchange meetings held in Xuchang, Yu County, and other places, the transaction volume of agricultural implements accounted for more than 80% of the total transaction volume. At the Yu County material exchange meeting, agricultural implements were in short supply.

In the northern Anhui region, state-owned grain companies have entrusted cooperatives to go deep into the countryside to supply grain. Prices of miscellaneous grains in Mengcheng, Yingshang, Fengtai, Bo County, Taihe, Fuyang, and other places have all fallen, and farmers in Sihong, Wuhe, and other places have begun to sell surplus grain. Barley has come onto the market in the Suxian Special District, and state-owned grain companies are purchasing it. Large quantities of grain have been transferred to the Huaiyin and Yancheng Special Districts of Jiangsu. Barley and Yuan wheat have come onto the market in the disaster areas. The grain market situation in Shandong has also improved. In five key markets in the Jiaozhou Special District, the amount of grain entering the market in the last four days of mid-May increased by 36% compared to the first four days of early May. The sales volume of state-owned grain companies decreased by 56%.

At present, all major regions across the country are continuing to transfer grain to the aforementioned disaster areas. The total amount of grain that has been transported to the disaster areas and is on its way is more than one billion jin.
