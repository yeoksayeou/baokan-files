    Regarding the letters from readers containing criticisms and suggestions published in the "Reader's Letters Digest" column of this newspaper before March, many response letters from relevant authorities have already been published in the newspaper. To keep readers informed of the handling of these issues, a consolidated summary of the remaining response letters is published below.

    Regarding industrial and agricultural production and financial work, the Guangzhou Railway Administration responded to the issue of the erroneous dismantling of vehicles by the Guilin Materials Branch of the former Hengyang Railway Administration (original letter published in this newspaper on January 25); the Anyang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative responded to the issue of moldy cottonseed in the Tangyin County Cooperative (original letter published in this newspaper on February 1); the Wuhan Automobile Ferry Management Office responded to the issue of a backlog of stagnant materials; the original Su County Native Produce Company responded to the issue of lost materials and tied-up funds (original letters regarding the above two issues were published in this newspaper on March 4); the Fengtai Engineering Section responded to the issue of four boxes of steel plates being abandoned for a long time (original letter published in this newspaper on March 27); the Luda Grain Company responded to the issue of poor grain packaging causing losses (original letter published in this newspaper on March 28). They reviewed the errors of bureaucracy in their work and insufficient responsibility towards state property, and resolved to correct these in the future and actively carry out follow-up work. The Materials Supply Department of the Harbin Railway Administration responded to the issue of failing to promptly resolve the need for octagonal steel at the Zhalantun Quarry (original letter published in this newspaper on January 25); the Suqian County People's Government responded to the issue of the Agriculture and Forestry Department violating financial discipline without self-criticism (original letters published in this newspaper on January 21 and March 15); Zhang Ziping, manager of the Shandong Weixian Tobacco and Hemp Branch Company, responded to the issue of continuous errors occurring in the company without self-criticism and correction (original letter published in this newspaper on March 27). They all conducted self-criticisms and promised not to repeat the errors in the future. The Central Ministry of Commerce responded to the issue of slow sales of sanitary oil in Shandong (original letter published in this newspaper on January 14), stating that it had been resolved. The Hebei Provincial Labor Bureau responded to the issue of excessively long working hours for employees of private enterprises in some areas of Hebei Province (original letter published in this newspaper on January 30), stating that it was being gradually resolved. The Supreme People's Procuratorate responded to the issue of the China Coal Construction Company's Inner Mongolia Regional Company transferring rotten wood into the customs area (original letter published in this newspaper on March 27), stating that the China Coal Construction General Company had conducted an inspection. The East China Inland River Shipping Company stated that the Fuding tugboat had been moored for a long time (original letter published in this newspaper on March 4) because the boat was not suitable for the company's use and had been reported to higher authorities for allocation to other departments, but a timely reply had not been received. The Hebei Provincial People's Bank stated that the situation of tobacco farmers in Yi County and other places experiencing financial difficulties due to bank loan recovery was not accurate (the original feedback was published in the "Main Issues of Readers' Letters This Week" section of this newspaper on January 8). The Tongxian Prefecture Administration explained the reasons for the "bridge toll" collection in Shunyi County (original letter published in this newspaper on February 19) and pointed out that the toll collectors may have sometimes used too harsh methods.

    Regarding the work style of cadres, the Shandong Laiyang Prefectural People's Supervision Office reported the results of handling the issue of Sun Keren, director of the Longkou City Horticultural Farm, resisting criticism (original letter published in this newspaper on January 11); the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission reported the results of handling the issue of leading cadres of the former Sunan People's Bank branch suppressing criticism (original letter published in the "Reader's Letters Page" of this newspaper on January 29); the Beijing Jingxi Mining Area People's Government reported the results of handling the issue of Shi Weilan accusing unscrupulous village cadre Li Youhui (original letter published in this newspaper on January 30). The Hebei Changli County Party Committee Office made a self-criticism for not promptly handling the reader Wang Jingmin's letter (original letter published in this newspaper on March 15) and reported the initial handling results of unscrupulous village cadres in Datancun. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry reported that it had instructed several livestock and veterinary cadres who were irresponsible during their work in rural areas to conduct self-criticisms. The Sichuan Wanxian Special District reported the situation of frequently changing orders during the intensive literacy training of cultural and educational cadres (original letters regarding the above two issues were published in this newspaper on February 7). The Office of the Central South Finance and Economics Committee reported the inspection of the Public Document Circulation Section's failure to use their brains when forwarding materials issued by the Central Finance and Economics Committee (original letter published in this newspaper on March 24).

    Regarding cultural and educational work, the Tianjin Municipal Cultural Affairs Bureau stated that it had educated the Tianjin Yongxing Printing and Publishing Bureau (original letter published in this newspaper on February 19, in which the Liansheng Paper Bookstore mentioned should be the seller) for randomly adding new titles to old New Year pictures. The Shanxi Fenyang County People's Government made a self-criticism for improperly organizing students to participate in excessive social activities and resolved to correct this in the future. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Culture and Education stated that it had found a way to resolve the issue of Suihua Middle School students standing guard. Su Yuanlei, the chief editor of the "Practical Dictionary of National Economy," made a self-criticism regarding readers' criticisms of many errors in the book (original letters regarding the above three issues were published in this newspaper on March 27) and explained the objective circumstances when editing the book. The publisher of the book, Shanghai Chunming Publishing House, also stated that it had found a way to correct the errors in the book.

    In addition, judging from several self-criticisms from the Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative Union's Nanzheng Special District Office regarding the misappropriation of loans for cotton insect control to hoard goods and make money (original letter published in this newspaper on February 27), the Jiangxi Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau regarding the chaotic work of the Wucheng Office of the Jiangxi Timber Company (original letter published in this newspaper on February 28), and the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the former Dongling Afforestation Bureau Director Zeng Yumin regarding the destruction of historical sites by the former Dongling Afforestation Bureau (original letter published in this newspaper on March 28), the situations reflected by the readers were factual, but the relevant leading authorities had already conducted inspections and were already handling the matters. In particular, the destruction of historical sites by the former Dongling Afforestation Bureau occurred between 1949 and 1950, and at that time, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry had already ordered the bureau to conduct a self-criticism. We believe that it is appropriate for readers to reflect the above situations, but if they had clearly stated in their letters that the leading authorities had already conducted inspections and handled the matters, it would have been more comprehensive.

    一月八日本报“一周读者来信的主要情况”内）。通县专署来信说明了顺义县征收“过桥费”问题的原因（原批评信刊二月十九日本报），并指出征费人员可能有时工作方式太生硬。
    在有关干部作风方面，山东莱阳专署人民监察处对龙口市园艺场场长孙克仁抗拒批评问题（原批评信刊一月十一日本报），江苏省委纪律检查委员会对原苏南人民银行分行领导干部压制批评问题（原批评信刊一月二十九日本报“读者来信专页”），北京市京西矿区人民政府对史维兰控告不法村干部李有会问题（原批评信刊一月三十日本报），都来信报告了处理结果。河北省昌黎县委办公室来信检讨了没及时处理读者王敬敏来信问题（原批评信刊三月十五日本报），并报告了对大滩村不法村干部的初步处理结果。浙江省农林厅报告，已责成下乡工作时不负责任的几个畜牧兽医干部作了检讨，四川万县专署报告了检查文教科集训速成识字干部时朝令夕改问题的情况（对以上两问题的原批评信均刊二月七日本报）。中南财委办公室来信报告该处公文运转科对转发中财委所发资料时不用脑筋问题（原批评信刊三月二十四日本报）的检查情况。
    在有关文教工作方面，天津市文化事业管理局来信说，已对在旧年画上乱加新标题的天津市永兴印刷出版局（原批评信刊二月十九日本报，其中提到的联胜纸书店应为销售者）进行教育。山西汾阳县人民政府对乱拉学生参加过多社会活动问题作了检讨，决心今后纠正。黑龙江省文教厅来信说明已设法解决绥化中学学生站岗问题。“国民经济实用辞典”主编者苏渊雷对读者批评该书错误很多问题（以上三个问题的原批评信都刊三月二十七日本报）作了检讨，并说明了编辑该书时的客观情况；该书出版者上海春明出版社也来信说，已设法勘误订正该书。
    此外，从陕西省合作社联合社南郑专区办事处对挪用除治棉虫贷款囤货赚钱问题（原批评信刊二月二十七日本报），江西省森林工业局对江西木材公司吴城办事处工作混乱问题（原批评信刊二月二十八日本报），以及河北省农林厅和原东陵造林局局长曾育民对原东陵造林局破坏古迹问题（原批评信刊三月二十八日本报）的几个检讨看来，读者反映的情况是事实，但这些事件有关领导机关早已进行了检查，并已在处理；尤其原东陵造林局破坏古迹问题发生在一九四九年、一九五○年间，而当时河北省农林厅已责令该局检讨。我们认为：读者反映上述情况是应该的，但如果他们在来信中把领导机关已经进行检查处理的情况写明，那就会比较全面了。
