    Hubei Province's Xishui County has made preliminary gains in improving leadership methods and correcting the "five excesses" phenomenon.
    In the past, some departments, in order to complete their tasks in isolation, one-sidedly emphasized the importance of departmental work, went to the countryside and interfered randomly, affecting the central work. In particular, bank cadres, in the work of issuing water conservancy loans last winter, did not proceed from the actual situation. The loan procedures were too cumbersome, and they one-sidedly emphasized system leadership and did not adequately implement the loan instructions uniformly deployed by the Party Committee, resulting in undue losses in the water conservancy loan work. For example, in the Jiming District, the entire district originally decided to loan 200 million yuan, but only over 30 million yuan has been loaned out so far. Cadres for eliminating illiteracy in the Culture and Education Section demanded too much too quickly and were not closely integrated with production. In Shuanghe Township, Bahe District, cadres for eliminating illiteracy held meetings during the day in the busy farming season, affecting production. Some department cadres even remained skeptical after the central government's instructions on spring plowing production were issued. A bank cadre in Wangci District reflected: "The central government's instructions are aimed at the whole country, but they may not be entirely suitable for the actual situation in Xishui." Because the work of various systems was not well unified and arranged, and the district and township cadres were accustomed to using general methods of holding meetings and mobilizing, there were still many meetings everywhere.
    Since returning from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Conference, the Xishui County Party Committee has repeatedly studied and researched the central government's instructions on spring plowing production and the People's Daily editorial. Based on the county's current actual situation, it convened a meeting of county and district cadres. Leading cadres of the County Party Committee made self-criticisms at the meeting, and the District Party Committee criticized various county-level departments. Each department also held its own departmental meetings to examine and criticize the bureaucratic work style in the past.
    Many new questions were raised in the discussion. Cadres in various departments worried that departmental work would not be implemented in the future and would be difficult to lead. District and township cadres thought: "It is good to have fewer meetings, but how can tasks be implemented when they come?" Wang Libin, Secretary of the Wanggang District Working Committee, said:
    "If the meeting dates are limited, what if we cannot seize the opportunity to promote advanced experience?"
    Based on the instructions from higher authorities, and after collecting many opinions from cadres at all levels and in various departments, the County Party Committee, after repeated research, adopted the following measures:
    Implement the Party Committee's unified leadership, unified deployment, and clear division of labor. All work must revolve around and be integrated with production. In the future, no department can directly assign tasks to districts and townships without the consent of the County Party Committee (administrative departments must first study and decide through the Party group). If district Party committees have different opinions on the work assigned by the County Party Committee, they can make suggestions; they can also make suggestions on the departments. Leading cadres at the county, district, and departmental levels must go to the countryside regularly for in-depth inspection. Generally, they are required to spend seven to ten days each month going to the countryside, paying attention to checking and discovering problems, and promptly raising them with local leaders to jointly study and solve them.
    Strengthen the unified leadership of Party branches in the countryside and gradually adjust rural branches. The main task of the district Party committee secretary is to go deep into the base points for leadership and to help the Party branch secretary study and lead production work. Use the base point township (two to three townships linked together) to lead and check work (but do not hold meetings casually in the base point township). The county only holds three township cadre meetings a year, and the district only holds three meetings a month. In the future, each township will mainly rely on mutual aid networks and district representative meetings to discuss and solve problems in production. Temporary meetings are not allowed to be convened casually, and no meetings or fewer meetings should be held during the busy farming season. Mainly rely on the use of typical demonstrations and small-scale competitions to promote production movements.
    In addition, the organizational structure in the countryside has also been greatly reduced, and organizations with similar functions have been merged as much as possible. In the future, the countryside will be administratively led by the township political committees generated on the basis of the People's Congress; these will be followed by civil affairs, armed security, culture and education, health, water conservancy, and finance and grain committees. Other unnecessary administrative organizations are hereby abolished.
    Leading cadres of district Party committees and various departments believe that this is much better than in the past. Cadres in various departments feel that it is still easier to lead departmental work, especially agreeing with the Party Committee's unified leadership and integrating work with the central task. District and township cadres feel that their work is also more active in the future. Everyone is confident that they will do a good job in the future production movement. (Li Shouyi)

    湖北浠水定出纠正“五多”现象的具体办法
    湖北省浠水县改进领导方法、纠正“五多”现象方面，已有初步收获。
    过去，有些部门为了孤立地完成本部门的任务，片面强调部门工作重要，下乡乱抓，影响了中心工作。特别是银行干部在去冬发放水利贷款工作中，不从实际情况出发，规定的贷款手续太麻烦，而且片面强调系统领导，对党委统一布置的贷款指示执行不够，结果使水利贷款工作受到不应有的损失。如鸡鸣区全区原来决定贷二亿元，到现在还只贷下去三千多万元。文教科扫除文盲的干部要求过高过急，紧密结合生产不够。巴河区双河乡扫除文盲干部在农忙季节白天开会，影响生产。甚至有些部门干部当中央关于春耕生产指示发布以后，仍然半信半疑。王祠区银行干部反映：“中央指示是针对全国提出来的，对于浠水的实际情况却不一定完全适合。”由于各系统工作没有很好地统一安排和布置，加以区乡干部习惯于用一般的开会发动的办法，各地会议仍然很多。
    中共浠水县委自从参加湖北省委农村工作会议回来以后，对中央春耕生产指示和人民日报社论进行了反复学习和研究，根据全县当前实际情况，召开了县区干部会议，县委领导干部在会上作了检讨，区委对县级各部门开展了批评。各部门也各自召开部门会议，检查批评了过去工作中的官僚主义作风。
    大家在讨论中提出了许多新的问题。各部门干部怕今后部门工作布置不下去，不好领导。区、乡干部认为：“会开少了好是好，但是任务来了怎么样贯彻得下去呢？”汪岗区工委书记王利滨说：
    “开会日期有限制，如果推广先进经验抓不住火候怎么办？”
    县委根据上级指示，并集中了各级各部门干部提出的许多意见，经过反复研究，采取了如下措施：
    实行党委统一领导、统一布置、明确分工。一切工作都必须围绕并结合生产。今后任何部门未经县委同意（行政部门首先要通过党组研究决定），不能直接向区、乡布置任务。各区委对县委布置工作如有不同意见，可以提出建议；对各部门有意见也可以提出。县、区及各部门领导干部，必须定期下乡，深入检查。一般要求：每月抽出七天到十天时间下乡，注意检查发现问题，及时向当地领导同志提出，共同研究解决。
    在农村加强党支部的统一领导并把农村支部逐步加以调整。区委书记主要任务是深入基点领导，并帮助党支部书记研究和领导生产工作。运用基点乡（两个到三个乡联起来）领导和检查工作（但不能在基点乡随便开会）。县内一年只开三次乡干部会，区内一个月只开三次会。各乡今后主要依靠互助网和区代表会议讨论和解决生产中的问题。临时会议不准随便召开，大农忙时就不开会或少开会。主要靠运用典型示范和小范围内的竞赛评比推动生产运动。
    另外，对农村的组织机构也大大减少，把性质相似的组织尽可能合并起来。今后农村由在人民代表大会基础上产生的乡政委员会进行行政领导；下设民政、武装治安、文教、卫生、水利、财粮等委员会，其他不必要的行政组织宣布取销。
    各区委和各部门领导干部认为这样作比过去好多了。各部门干部听说今后能够经常下去检查工作，感觉到部门工作还是便于领导的，尤其同意党委统
    一领导、结合中心进行工作。区、乡干部觉得今后工作也主动多了。大家都有信心把今后的生产运动搞好。　（李守宜）
