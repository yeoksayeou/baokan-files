Prepare for Grassroots Elections
　　Zhou Fang

    The Central Election Committee's instructions regarding grassroots election work stipulate that the period from May to October this year will be the time for elections in grassroots units such as townships, towns, urban districts of cities, and cities without districts throughout the country. At the same time, it points out: "People's governments at all levels above the county and city levels and election committees at all levels must regard guiding elections in grassroots units as the focus of all election work." This is because grassroots election work is the foundation of the election work for people's congresses at all levels, both nationally and locally. As long as the grassroots election work is done well, the election work at the county and city levels will be easier.
    The purpose of grassroots election work is to fully mobilize the masses, allowing the people to exercise their rights as masters of the country according to their own will, and to elect people who are loved by them and have close ties with them to serve as their representatives, forming grassroots governments that are very close to their lives and closely related to their interests, so that they can represent themselves in managing the country and completing various work tasks. The system of people's congresses elected through universal suffrage is a democratic system suitable for the current situation in our country; however, its effectiveness in practice, whether it can meet our ideals and realize the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," whether it can concentrate the strength and wisdom of the masses and, in turn, guide the broad masses to take action to seek benefits for the masses, one of the most important determining factors is whether the grassroots government is sound. Since we adopt the method of directly electing grassroots people's representatives and indirectly electing people's representatives at the county and city levels and above, grassroots election work and grassroots government work are even more important.
    To do a good job in grassroots election work, counties and cities must make serious preparations. The Central Election Committee's instructions on grassroots election work state: "The quality of grassroots election work depends on the leadership of counties and cities. People's governments and their election committees at the county and city levels must formulate precise plans and make full preparations in accordance with the procedures for grassroots elections in order to ensure their smooth progress and timely completion." The most important aspects of preparation are training cadres and conducting key trials. Without a large number of cadres who are familiar with the policies and techniques of election work, it will be difficult to do such a new and important task well. At the same time, cadres without considerable experience cannot gain a deep understanding simply by reading relevant documents. Therefore, it is necessary to combine cadre training with key trials. The aforementioned instructions state: "After studying the documents, it is best to divide all cadres and staff members into several teams, led by responsible comrades from the county, to conduct typical trials in several grassroots units to gain practical experience, and then go to various places to guide the election work." This is a correct way to combine theory with practice. Because the time for studying the documents is very short, with cadres guiding the elections studying for only about seven days and general working cadres studying for only about three days, there must be a strict study plan in advance to achieve a high level of learning effectiveness; responsible comrades in each county and city should first study the documents well themselves and provide clear explanations of the important provisions of the documents to those participating in the study.
    In order to do a good job in publicizing grassroots elections, it is necessary to make cadres participating in and guiding grassroots elections understand the importance of publicity work and mobilizing the masses, and be able to clearly explain the following three points to the broad masses: the importance of election work and the solemnity of electoral rights; who has the right to vote and be elected, and who does not have the right to vote and be elected; and what kind of people should be elected as representatives. Only in this way can the masses be fully mobilized to actively participate in the three main tasks of voter registration, candidate nomination, and voter meetings. The publicity regarding population surveys and registration should not be carried out separately from the election work; it is necessary to first publicize the election work and then explain that in order to do a good job in the election work, it is necessary to register the population. Moreover, the publicity work should be carried out throughout the entire election process, identifying problems at any time and explaining them to the masses at any time.
    Of all the election work, the work that must mobilize the broad masses to participate in mainly includes three things: voter registration, candidate nomination, and voter meetings. Therefore, when training cadres, they must understand that these are the three important links in the election work. The first is voter registration (along with population survey and registration). The question here is: Who has the right to vote? Who does not have the right to vote? The main line that needs to be drawn is the line between the enemy and us, the line between the masters of the regime and the objects of dictatorship. We say that electoral rights are solemn precisely for this reason. "Neither can we allow a reactionary element or a landlord class element who has not changed his status to illegally seize the solemn electoral rights," "nor can we allow a citizen to be wrongly deprived of the solemn electoral rights," both for this reason. Therefore, we must "call on everyone to care about voter registration work and to express opinions or file lawsuits regarding the published voter list." The second is candidate nomination. The question here is: Who should be a candidate? Who should not be a candidate? The main line that needs to be drawn is the line between good people and bad people. Bad people—counter-revolutionary elements and landlord class elements hidden in the regime, those who violate laws and discipline, and those who have committed serious mistakes and are extremely dissatisfied with by the people—should not be elected as candidates. Only those who are loved by the masses and connected to the masses, those who are representative, those whom the masses are happy to have participate in the work of the regime and who are considered necessary to participate in the work of the regime, should be nominated as candidates. It is for this reason that we say that election work "enables all cadres to receive a profound education under the judgment of the masses." The so-called "combining election work with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline" is mainly combined here. Only by doing this step well can the grassroots government be completely purified. Therefore, there should be more consultation when carrying out this work. "In rural areas, the general method that can be adopted is for the election committee to invite representatives from the Communist Party organization and various people's organizations to conduct consultations." Overall considerations should be taken into account, "attention should be paid to the broad popular representation of the People's Congress, that is, attention should be paid to ensuring that all strata and all nationalities have a number of representatives in the People's Congress that is commensurate with their status, and special attention should be paid to the number of women representatives." The most important thing is to organize the masses to carefully discuss and distinguish, allowing them to "ruthlessly remove those they consider to be bad and propose those they consider appropriate." The third is the voter meeting. This is the last link in the entire election process. Once the election is completed, all that remains is to convene the People's Congress. Voter meetings require "attracting voters to consciously and enthusiastically participate in the election on the basis of in-depth mobilization, so that the number of people participating in the election accounts for a very high proportion of the total number of voters." To achieve this, it is necessary to "make all the masses aware of the significance of the election and its close relationship with the people, and make voters aware of the solemnity of electoral rights," so that everyone will "cherish this glorious right and actively participate in the election." To this end, it is necessary to adopt methods that are convenient for the masses. If there are still shortcomings of bureaucracy or commandism in the work, it will inevitably be impossible to achieve this. Therefore, whether the voter meeting is held well is a test and an important indicator of how well the grassroots election is done. In order to enable cadres to lead the work in the above-mentioned links well, they should be helped during cadre training to summarize the existing experience from the past when the People's Representative Conference exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, or introduce the experience of other regions. Carry forward and utilize its good and correct parts, criticize and discard its bad and incorrect parts. At the same time, the existing problems in the areas where the cadres are located, such as various problems in terms of voter qualifications, various problems among cadres, and various problems in the election, should be specifically summarized and studied, and appropriately resolved in this general election.
    The grassroots election work is being carried out during the busy farming season. Therefore, all localities must educate cadres to strictly adhere to the principle that agricultural production is the overriding central task in rural areas and combine election work with production. "Seize the time and take advantage of the gaps." If production is disregarded and only elections are considered, delaying agricultural time and hindering production due to elections will cause procedural confusion and dissatisfaction among farmers. Cadres should understand that election work can improve the political enthusiasm of the masses, which in turn promotes the production enthusiasm of the masses. In the past, many places used the slogan "Step up production to welcome the election" to promote production before the election, and at the same time squeezed out time to conduct the election; after the election, they used the slogan "Step up production to celebrate the election victory" to push production to a climax; many places collected the masses' proposals on production during the election process so that they could be submitted to the People's Congress for discussion, making the election work closely coordinated with the production work, which are all effective methods and should be summarized and promoted in this cadre training.

### 做好基层选举的准备工作

    做好基层选举的准备工作
  　周方
    中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示，规定今年五月到十月为全国乡、镇、市辖区和不设区的市等基层单位的选举时间，同时指出：“县、市以上各级人民政府和各级选举委员会必须把指导基层单位的选举，作为全部选举工作的重点。”这是因为基层选举工作是全国及地方各级人民代表大会选举工作的基础。只要把基层选举工作做好了，县、市以上的选举工作就容易了。
    基层选举工作的目的，是要放手发动群众，让人民按照自己的意志，行使国家主人的权利，选举出为自己所爱戴并且和自己有密切联系的人，去充当自己的代表，组成和自己的生活十分接近、和自己的利害密切相关的基层政权，以便代表自己去管理国家，完成各项工作任务。普选的人民代表大会的制度，是适合于我国目前情况的民主制度；但它在实践中的功效如何，是否能符合我们的理想，实现
    “从群众中来到群众中去”的原则，是否能集中群众的力量与智慧，并转而引导广大群众行动起来，为群众谋福利，其重要的决定关键之一，就在基层政权是不是健全。我们既采用直接选举基层人民代表而间接选举县、市以上各级人民代表的办法，则基层选举工作与基层政权工作就更为重要。
    要把基层选举工作做好，县、市必须进行认真的准备。中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示上说：“基层选举工作的好坏，决定于县、市的领导。县、市人民政府及其选举委员会，必须按照基层选举的程序，订出精确的计划，作好充分的准备，才能保证其顺利进行与如期完成。”准备工作中，最重要的是训练干部和重点试验。没有大量的熟悉选举工作的政策和技术的干部，要想做好这样一件新的重大的工作是困难的。同时，干部没有相当的经验，单凭读一些有关的文件，也不可能体会得深刻。因此，必须把训练干部与重点试验二者结合起来。上述指示中说：“文件学习之后，最好将所有干部和工作人员，分成若干队，由县的负责同志率领，到若干基层单位，进行典型试办，取得实际经验，而后分别到各地指导选举工作。”这就是一种使理论与实际相结合的正确办法。因为学习文件的时间很短，指导选举的干部只学习七天左右，一般工作干部只学习三天左右，因此必须事先有严密的学习计划，才能有高度的学习效果；各县、市负责同志应该首先自己学好文件，将文件的重要规定向参加学习者作明确的讲解。
    为了做好有关基层选举的宣传工作，必须使参加与指导基层选举的干部懂得宣传工作与发动群众的重要性，并能很好地向广大群众宣传解释以下三点，即选举工作的重要性和选举权利的庄严性；那些人有选举权和被选举权，那些人没有选举权和被选举权；应该选举什么样的人当代表。这样才能充分地动员群众积极参加选民登记、候选人提名和选民大会三项主要的工作。关于人口调查登记的宣传，一定不要脱离选举工作去单独进行，必须先宣传选举工作，然后再讲为了做好选举工作，必须登记人口。而且宣传工作应该贯彻于全部选举工作的过程中，随时发现问题，随时向群众讲解。
    全部选举工作中，必须动员广大群众来参加的工作，主要有三件，即选民登记，候选人提名和选民大会。因此，在训练干部时，必须让他们了解这是选举工作的三个重要环节。第一个，选民登记（与此同时尚有人口调查登记）。这里的问题是：谁有选举权？谁没有选举权？要划清的主要界限，就是敌我界限，政权主人和专政对象的界限。我们说选举权利是庄严的，正是这个缘故。“不能让一个反动分子或未经改变成份的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的选举权利”，“也不能让一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利”，都是这个缘故。因此就要“号召大家关心选民登记工作，并对公布的选民名单提出意见或提出诉讼。”第二个，候选人提名。这里的问题是：谁应该当候选人？谁不应该当候选人？要划清的主要界限，就是好人坏人的界限？坏人——隐藏在政权中的反革命分子和地主阶级分子、违法乱纪分子和犯有严重错误而为人民群众所极不满意的分子——是不应该当选候选人的。只有那些为群众所爱戴的联系群众的人，那些具有代表性的，群众乐于叫他们参加政权工作而又认为有必要让他参加政权工作的人，才应该被提为候选人。说选举工作“使所有干部都能在群众的鉴别下受到
    一次深刻的教育”，正是这个缘故。所谓“把选举工作与反官僚主义、反命令主义和反违法乱纪的斗争结合起来”，主要就结合在此。也只有做好这一步，才能使基层政权完全纯洁起来。因此，在进行这一工作时应该多多协商。“在乡村，一般可采取由选举委员会邀集共产党组织及各人民团体的代表进行协商的办法。”应该照顾到全面，“注意到人民代表大会的广泛的人民代表性，即应注意到各阶层各民族都在人民代表大会中有与其地位相当的代表名额，尤其要注意到妇女的代表名额。”而最重要的，则在组织群众慎重的讨论和鉴别，让他们“毫不容情地去掉那些自己认为不好的人，提出自己认为适当的人。”第三个，选民大会。这是全部选举过程的最后一环。选举完毕，就只待召开人民代表大会了。选民大会要求“在深入动员的基础上，吸引选民自觉地热烈地参加选举，使参加选举的人数占全体选民数的很高的比例。”要做到这一点，必须“使所有群众认识选举的意义及与人民群众的切身关系，使选民认识选举权利的庄严性”，使大家都“珍贵这个光荣的权利，从而积极地参加选举”。为此，就必须采用便利群众的办法。如果工作中仍然有官僚主义或命令主义的缺点，就必然做不到这一点。所以选民大会开的好不好，是一个考验，也是基层选举做得好坏的重要标志。为了使干部都能领导好上述几个环节的工作，应该在训练干部时帮助他们，总结过去人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权时已有的经验，或介绍别的地区的经验。发扬和利用其好的和正确的部分，批判和抛弃其不好的和不正确的部分。同时把干部所在地区现存的问题，如选民资格方面的各种问题，干部中的各种问题，选举中的各种问题，加以具体的概括研究，在这次大选中予以适当解决。
    基层选举工作进行时，正值农忙季节。因此，各地必须教育干部严格掌握农村以农业生产为压倒一切的中心工作的原则，把选举工作结合生产去进行。 “抓紧时间，利用空隙”。如果不顾生产，只顾选举，因选举而耽误了农时，妨碍了生产，就会引起程序的紊乱，使农民不满意。应该使干部了解：选举工作能提高群众的政治积极性，反转来推动群众的生产积极性。过去很多地方在选举前曾用“加紧生产，迎接选举”的口号来推动生产，同时也挤出来了办选举的时间；在选举后又用“加紧生产，庆祝选举胜利”的口号把生产推向高潮；有很多地方在选举过程中就搜集群众对生产的提案，以便交到人民代表大会上去讨论，使选举工作与生产工作密切配合，都是行之有效的办法，应该在此次训练干部时加以总结、推广。
