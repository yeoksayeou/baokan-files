Xinhua News Agency, May 26th dispatch: According to a TASS report from Paris on May 23rd: "L'Humanité" published the French Communist Party's statement on the government crisis.

The statement pointed out: The Mayer government has collapsed. The government crisis is the result of the government's implementation of policies against the people and in following US imperialism. The people are increasingly strongly opposed to this policy.

The statement said: The vast majority of the nation hopes for peace in Indochina and comprehensive negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the most acute international issues. However, the government intends to continue the war, intensify the exploitation of the colonies, maintain the heavy burden of military expenditures, and hinder the implementation of the Soviet Union's proposals to ease international tensions. The so-called "financial recovery" bill submitted by the government to the National Assembly for deliberation will only make the people more miserable. It also adds new restrictions to parliamentary rights, which is a new step towards fascism. This bill has aroused legitimate anxiety and unease among the working class. It has greatly promoted the struggle of the working people to meet their demands and for freedom. In this situation, the majority who initially favored Mayer's bill split. The government therefore collapsed.

The statement exposed the fascist conspiracies of the ruling groups. It said: Some members of parliament believe that the government crisis should be resolved by expanding the government, and that the government should receive broader majority support in order to more effectively oppose the demands of the workers and the wishes of the nation. From this point of view, De Gaulle decided to allow his parliamentary group to act freely, so that representatives of this dictator candidate could participate in the future government.

The statement reaffirmed the French Communist Party's proposal to organize a peaceful national democratic government. This government should stop the Indochina War, reject the Bonn and Paris Treaties, resolve the German issue and all other issues through negotiations, reduce military expenditures to meet the needs of the people, release arrested patriots, and restore democratic rights and national independence.

The statement said: As millions of French people are increasingly clearly seeing the possibility of implementing new policies, the French Communist Party calls on the workers of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, as well as all working people, to strengthen and expand the unity of their ranks and fight against the reactionaries. The French Communist Party calls on all French people who are willing to implement new policies to unite around the working class in order to establish a national democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, May 26th dispatch: Paris news: The French working people have launched incessant strikes to defend their right to live.

On the 23rd, railway workers in several parts of France held strikes separately to demand wage increases. Ninety-five percent of railway workers in Lyon participated in the strike; train services in Dijon were reduced by ninety percent due to the railway workers' strike. Employees at the Paris Lyon station also held strikes on the 22nd and 23rd.

Transportation workers in Clermont-Ferrand went on strike for four hours on the 23rd. Tram workers in Marseille, who have been on strike every Sunday for the past six weeks, also held a four-hour strike on this day.

On the 20th, employees of power plants and gas plants in Paris held a general strike for 24 hours, demanding wage increases and protesting against the government's so-called "financial recovery" plan, which specifically deprives the working people of various economic rights. The strike caused the electricity and gas supply in Paris to be almost completely cut off.

On the 19th, underground tram and bus workers in Paris held a 24-hour strike.

On the 14th, hotel workers in Paris, who had recently repeatedly gone on strike to demand food subsidies, held another 24-hour strike.

The National Federation of Railway Employees, affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labor, decided to hold a large-scale railway workers' strike on the 27th, demanding higher wages. Postal workers and sanitation workers in the Seine Provincial Government have decided to act in unison with the railway workers.

French merchant sailors in various seaports, who began striking in late April to demand shorter working hours and increased holidays, have resumed work on the 18th and 19th after the employers agreed to increase holidays.

Xinhua News Agency, May 26th dispatch: TASS Paris: The prestige of the French General Confederation of Labor is constantly increasing in the French working class's struggle for rights.

According to democratic newspapers, the French General Confederation of Labor won another victory in the Renault car factory worker representatives' election on May 19th. The General Confederation of Labor received 72 percent of the total votes, an increase of 9 percent compared to last year.

    法国共产党发表关于政府危机的声明
    重申关于组织和平的民族民主政府的主张
    法国劳动人民为保卫生活权利接连举行罢工
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党关于政府危机的声明。
    声明指出：迈耶政府已经垮台。政府危机是政府执行反对人民和追随美帝国主义的政策的结果。人民越来越强烈地反对这种政策。
    声明说：全国绝大多数人都希望在印度支那实现和平，希望进行全面谈判，以便和平解决最尖锐的国际问题。但是政府打算继续战争，加紧压榨殖民地，维持军费开支的沉重负担，阻挠苏联为缓和国际紧张局势而提出的建议的实现。政府提交国民议会审议的所谓“财政复兴”法案，只会使人民更加不幸。它还给议会权利加上新的限制，这是走向法西斯主义的新的一步。这个法案在工人阶级中引起了正当的焦虑和不安。它大大地促进了劳动人民为满足自己的要求、为自由而进行的斗争。在这种情况下，起初对迈耶的法案有好感的多数派就分裂了。政府因此垮台。
    声明揭露了统治集团的法西斯阴谋。它说：有部分议员认为政府危机要用扩大政府的方法来解决，认为政府应该得到更广泛的多数派支持，以便更有效地反对工人的要求和全国的愿望。从这种观点出发，戴高乐就决定让他的议会党团自由行动，好让这个独裁者候选人的代表有可能参加未来的政府。
    声明重申法国共产党关于组织和平的民族民主政府的主张。这个政府要停止印度支那战争，要拒绝波恩和巴黎条约，要以谈判方式解决德国问题及其他一切问题，要缩减军费开支以便满足人民的要求，要释放被捕爱国者，要恢复民主权利和民族独立。
    声明说：当千百万法国人越来越清楚地看到实行新的政策的可能性时，法国共产党号召共产党和社会党的工人以及全体劳动人民加强并且扩大自己队伍的团结，和反动派斗争。法国共产党号召一切愿意实行新政策的法国人团结在工人阶级的周围，以便建立一个民族民主政府。
    【新华社二十六日讯】巴黎消息：法国劳动人民为保卫生活权利，发动了连绵不绝的罢工。
    二十三日，法国几个地方的铁路工人为要求增加工资，分别举行了罢工。里昂铁路工人有百分之九十五参加了罢工；第戎的火车班次因铁路工人罢工而减少了百分之九十。巴黎里昂车站职工在二十二日和二十三日也举行了罢工。
    克勒蒙—腓隆的交通工人二十三日罢工四小时。在最近六个星期内每个星期日都举行罢工的马赛电车工人，在这一天也举行了四小时罢工。
    二十日，巴黎各发电站和煤气厂的职工总罢工二十四小时，要求增加工资，并抗议政府专门剥夺劳动人民各种经济权利的所谓“财政复兴”计划。罢工使得巴黎全市电力和煤气供应几乎完全断绝。
    十九日，巴黎地下电车和公共汽车工人举行了二十四小时罢工。
    十四日，最近曾屡次罢工要求食物津贴的巴黎旅馆业工人又举行了二十四小时罢工。
    隶属法国总工会的全国铁路员工联合会决定在二十七日举行铁路工人大罢工，要求提高过低的工资。邮政局的职工和塞纳省省政府的清洁工人都决定和铁路工人一致行动。
    从四月下旬为要求缩短工时和增加假期而开始罢工的法国各海港商船船员，在资方答应增加假期后，已经在十八日和十九日恢复工作。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总工会的威望在法国工人阶级争取权利的斗争中不断提高。
