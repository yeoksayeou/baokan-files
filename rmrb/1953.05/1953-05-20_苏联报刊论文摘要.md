Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

Pay More Attention to Young Experts

The Soviet "Gudok" published an editorial on April 28th, pointing out the important national significance of correctly using young experts. The abstract is as follows:

Young cadres have a sense for new things. They can inject new blood into production work and support everything advanced and progressive. But they lack experience and practice. They need serious help and special care. This mainly relies on the political departments, economic organizations, Party organizations, and the Communist Youth League. These organizations should follow Stalin's principle of correctly coordinating young cadres and old cadres, and create good conditions for the work of young experts and their political and professional improvement.

Correctly using young cadres means paying attention to assigning their work so that everyone feels that they are in the right place, can give full play to their abilities in their positions, and contribute their individual talents to the maximum extent.

Correctly using young experts is a great undertaking of important national significance. Political departments and Party organizations cannot stand idly by in this undertaking. It is necessary to resolutely combat some intolerable facts: for example, allowing young engineers to serve as weighers, cargo clerks, telegraph operators, work team leaders, and duty officers on the lines and at stations for a long time.

The leaders of various enterprises are primarily responsible for correctly using young engineers and technicians according to the specialized skills they acquired in school. It is completely intolerable to not use engineers and technicians according to their specialized skills. Because these specialized skills are what they have acquired after many years of study, and the state has also spent a lot of money in training these cadres.

The Socialist Humanism of Soviet Medicine

The Soviet "Medical Worker's Gazette" published an article on May 1st by Anichkov, the president of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, entitled "The Socialist Humanism of Soviet Medicine." The abstract is as follows:

Medicine is one of the most humane branches of human knowledge and culture. Its main purpose is to treat patients, prevent diseases, protect people's health, care for the improvement of people's labor and living conditions, and care for the cultivation of a healthy generation.

Advanced medical scientists have always served this noble humanitarian purpose. However, in the bourgeois society governed by the barbaric law of "man eats man," their mission to patients is limited. In the past, especially in Western countries, the efforts of progressive medical scientists were in a helpless and isolated situation.

In the past, advanced medical workers worked tirelessly to serve the humanitarian purpose of life and the development of medicine. But these were just a few scattered stars in the dark sky of the old world.

Only after the great October Revolution did the era of true socialist humanism begin.

Now, amidst the barbaric cries of human hatred propagated by the imperialist camp, there are some criminal representatives of bourgeois medicine who are making science serve commerce and war preparations.

In imperialist countries, the idea of humanism has been completely trampled upon. Replacing these ideas are the barbaric fascism and the ideas of hatred of mankind.

Soviet scientists are now engaged in solving the most important problems such as prolonging life and completely eliminating diseases. Our medical research has produced treatments for many dangerous diseases and created methods to stop the spread of epidemics.

Together with all advanced sciences, medicine has refuted the inevitability of plague and famine, the spontaneity of terrible diseases, and the false "laws" that have always existed.

The purpose and task of Soviet medicine is to obey the noble humanitarian idea of doing everything possible to protect the health of the Soviet people.

Pavlov's genius theory has raised medicine to a new and higher stage. This theory can provide a correct concept for the origin and nature of many diseases and the treatments for these diseases. Applying Pavlov's ideas to practical medicine is one of the most vivid manifestations of true humanism.

The development of medicine in the direction of prevention is only possible in our socialist society, because socialist society creates all the conditions for the happy life of the Soviet people and for the protection of their health.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    更多地注意青年专家
    苏联“汽笛报”四月二十八日发表社论，指出正确
    地使用青年专家的重要国家意义，摘要如下：
    青年干部具有对新鲜事物的感觉。他们能够给生产工作注入新的血液，支持一切先进的和进步的事物。但是他们缺乏经验和实践。他们需要认真的帮助，需要得到别人的特别关心。这就主要依靠政治部、经济组织、党组织和青年团。这些组织应当遵循斯大林的把青年干部和老干部正确配合的原则，为青年专家的工作和他们在政治和业务上的提高，创立良好的条件。
    正确地使用青年干部，就是说，要注意把他们的工作分配得使每个人都感到各得其所，都能在他们的岗位上发挥自己的全部能力，最大限度地供献个人所有的才能。
    正确地使用青年专家是一件伟大的、具有重要国家意义的事业。政治部和党组织对这件事业不能袖手旁观。必须坚决地和一些不能容忍的事实作斗争：例如让青年工程师长期地在线路上、在车站上担任司磅员、货物出纳员、报务员、工作队队长和值日员等。
    各企业的领导人首先负有依照青年工程师和技术员在学校中学得的专门技能来正确使用他们的责任。不按照工程师和技术员的专门技能来使用他们，是完全不能容忍的。因为这种专门技能，是他们学习了好多年才获得的，而国家在培养这些干部，也花费了大量的资金。
    苏联医学的社会主义的人道主义
    苏联“医务工作者报”五月一日发表苏联医学科学
    院院长阿尼奇科夫所写的以“苏联医学的社会主义的
    人道主义”为题的论文。摘要如下：
    医学是最人道的人类知识和文化之一。它的主要目的就是医治病人，预防疾病，保护人的健康，关心人们的劳动和生活条件的改善，关心培养健康的一代。
    先进的医学家们总是为这个高尚的人道目的服务的。但，在“人吃人”的野蛮法则支配下的资产阶级社会里，他们要实现对病人的使命受有限制的。过去，特别是在西方各国进步医学家的努力，是在一种孤立无助的情况中。
    过去，先进医学工作者，为了生命，为了发展服务于人道目的的医学，曾不惜余力地努力工作。但这不过是旧世界黑暗天空中寥落的几颗明星罢了。
    只有在伟大的十月革命以后，才开始了真正的社会主义的人道主义的纪元。
    现在，帝国主义阵营方面宣传人类仇恨的野蛮叫嚣中间，就有一些资产阶级医学的犯罪代表人物，正在使科学服务于商业和战争准备。
    在帝国主义国家中，人道主义的思想已完全被践踏了。代替这些思想的是野蛮的法西斯主义和憎恨人类的思想。
    苏联的科学家现在正从事解决延长寿命和完全消灭疾病等最重要的问题。我国的医学研究出许多凶险疾病的治疗法，并创造了制止流行病传染的方法。
    和一切先进科学一起，医学驳倒了关于瘟疫、饥荒的不可避免性，和关于可怕的疾病的自发性，和永远存在的虚伪“法则”。
    苏联医学的目的和任务是服从于尽力保护苏联人民的健康的高尚的人道思想。
    巴夫洛夫的天才学说把医学提高到新的、高级的阶段。这个学说对于许多疾病的起源和本质以及这些疾病的治疗法能够作出正确的概念。把巴夫洛夫的思想应用在实际的医学中，这就是真正人道主义最鲜明表现之一。
    医学向预防方向的发展，只有在我们社会主义社会才有可能，因为社会主义的社会为苏联人的幸福生活，为保护他们的健康创造了一切条件。
