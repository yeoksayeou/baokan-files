    A Perfunctory Work Report
    Guan Tang
    On April 10th, the Yangzhou Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu Province received a report from the Yangzhou Municipal People's Government on the city's disaster relief efforts in April. After reviewing the report, the leaders of the Commissioner's Office found it very strange because the disaster relief situation described in this report was no different from the reports for January and February. The material concerning the suburban areas was exactly the same as that in January and February. Furthermore, the reports for January and February stated that the cold wave last winter had killed the vegetables planted by farmers in the suburbs, with an estimated loss of 3.3 "billion" yuan, while the April report estimated the loss at 330,000 yuan, a difference of ten thousand times. According to reports from other counties and cities, the disaster situation in various places was constantly changing (either developing or shrinking), so why was the disaster situation in Yangzhou unchanging? This could not but raise doubts in the minds of the leaders of the Commissioner's Office about the authenticity of this work report.
    In order to find out the truth, the Commissioner's Office sent people twice in succession to conduct investigations in Buqiao Village, Shuangqiao Township, the "typical" investigation village mentioned in Yangzhou's report. According to Xu Jingu, the secretary of the Shuangqiao Township Party Branch, many of the green vegetables planted by the farmers of Buqiao Village were frozen to death in January and February of this year (around the Spring Festival), and at that time 40 households were experiencing hardship and needed relief. However, in early March, the Yangzhou Municipal infrastructure construction project started, and every day hundreds of villagers went to the construction site to dig earthwork and do odd jobs, earning 5,000 to 8,000 yuan per person per day. In addition, the weather turned warmer, and the vegetables planted were not only enough for their own consumption but could also be sold in the market. At present, except for 13 households that need temporary assistance due to a shortage of labor and large families, and 5 households of elderly, weak, and sick people who need year-round relief, Buqiao Village has basically no disaster situation. However, in its April report, Yangzhou still wrote that the disaster situation in Buqiao Village was serious, and 40 disaster-stricken households were in urgent need of relief. It is very clear that Yangzhou's April report on the disaster relief work situation was simply a copy of the January and February reports, written while sitting in the office. As for the difference between "3.3 billion" and "330,000" in the figures, perhaps it was a careless mistake made by the copier. Everyone can clearly see: the Yangzhou Municipal People's Government has adopted such a serious bureaucratic attitude towards the current disaster relief work! What role can such a report, designed to perfunctorily deal with the higher authorities, play in our work?
    Currently, various agencies in Yangzhou are engaged in anti-bureaucracy study sessions. During this period, the Yangzhou Municipal People's Government is still behaving in this way. We don't know how the bureaucrat who wrote this report is treating this anti-bureaucracy struggle. If this kind of bureaucratic style is not eliminated, it will cause endless damage to the revolutionary cause.

    一份应付差事的工作报告
    冠唐
    江苏省扬州专员公署，在四月十号收到扬州市人民政府的一份关于该市四月份救灾工作情况的报告。专署领导方面看了这份工作报告后觉得很奇怪，因为这份报告里的救灾工作情况和一、二月份的报告没有什么差别，市郊区的材料则和一、二月份完全相同。还有，在一、二月份的报告里说，去冬寒流袭击，市郊农民种的菜蔬被冻死，估计损失是三十三“亿”元，而四月份的报告里，估计损失是三十三“万”元，相差万倍。根据其他各县市的汇报，各地灾情都在不断变化着（不是发展就是缩小），而扬州市的灾情为什么没有变化呢？这就不能不引起专署领导方面对这份工作报告的真实性有所怀疑。
    为了弄清真相，专署就先后两次派人到扬州市的报告中所说的“典型”调查村——双桥乡卜桥村进行调查。根据双桥乡党支部书记徐金谷汇报：今年一、二月份（春节前后）卜桥村农民所种的青菜被冻死很多，当时有四十户生活困难，需要救济。但是到三月上旬，扬州市基本建设工程开工了，村里每天都有百十人到工地挖土方做小工，每天每人可得五千到八千元的工资；加上天气转暖，所种的菜蔬除够自吃外，还可到市场出卖。眼前村里除有十三户因劳力少、人口多，阴天下雨需要临时照顾，和五户老弱疾病需要常年救济外，卜桥村基本上已没有了灾情。而扬州市在四月份的报告中，仍然写着卜桥村灾情严重，有四十户灾民急需救济。很明显，扬州市四月份的救灾工作情况报告，是坐在办公室里照抄的一、二月份的报告。至于“三十三亿”和“三十三万”数字上的差别，或许是抄的人粗心大意抄错了。大家可以明白地看出：扬州市人民政府对待目前救灾工作是采取了多么严重的官僚主义态度！像这样一份应付上级的报告对我们的工作能起什么作用呢？
    目前扬州市各机关正在进行反官僚主义的学习，而在这期间，扬州市人民政府竟仍然如此，我们不知道写这一个报告的官僚主义者究竟是怎样来对待这次反官僚主义斗争的？像这种官僚主义作风，如果不反掉，对革命事业将有无穷的损害。
