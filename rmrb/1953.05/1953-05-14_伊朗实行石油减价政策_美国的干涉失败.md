(TASS, Tehran, May 10th) Tehran Radio has been broadcasting daily in many languages for the past few days the Iranian government's decision, announced on April 27th, to reduce the price of Iranian oil and petroleum products shipped from Abadan to the United States and Japan and paid for in US dollars by 50%, for a period of six months.

This decision by the Iranian government has aroused great interest among many American and Japanese oil companies, which are sending representatives to Iran to negotiate the export of Iranian oil. "Today's Orient" reported that by April 30th, five Americans had arrived in Tehran to purchase Iranian oil. Engineer Paheed, the Commercial Director of the Iranian National Oil Company, was dispatched by Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh from Tehran to Japan on April 29th to negotiate and sign contracts with Japanese companies wishing to purchase Iranian oil.

"Today's Orient" estimates that if only 5 million tons of crude oil and 3 million tons of petroleum products are exported annually, the Iranian government's annual income will be double the annual rental income paid by the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in recent years. The former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company produced more than 30 million tons of oil annually in recent years.

The Iranian government's decision, and the impact it has had, has greatly alarmed the Anglo-American oil monopolists, who are continuing to impose an economic blockade on Iran's nationalized oil, trying every means to force Iran to accept their conditions in order to seize Iran's oil industry.

Tehran newspapers pointed out that U.S. Ambassador to Iran, Henderson, met with Prime Minister Mossadegh on May 3rd. During the three-hour meeting, Henderson spoke of the adverse effects caused by the Iranian government's decision to reduce the price of Iranian oil by half.

"The World News" reported that Henderson expressed great dissatisfaction with the statement made by Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Seylla, who had promoted the Iranian government's decision in the United States.

Iranian newspapers said that Mossadegh, under pressure from Iranian public opinion, rejected the demands made by Britain and the United States to obey the interests of the world's oil monopolists.

    伊朗实行石油减价政策
    美国的干涉失败
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社德黑兰十日讯：德黑兰电台最近几天每天都用许多种语言广播已在四月二十七日公布的伊朗政府的决定，即把从阿巴丹输往美国和日本并以美元支付的伊朗石油和石油产品的价格减低百分之五十，减价期限是六个月。
    伊朗政府的这一决定已经引起许多美国和日本石油公司的极大兴趣，它们正在纷纷派遣代表到伊朗去接洽输出伊朗石油的交易。“今日东方报”说，到四月三十日为止，已有五个美国人到了德黑兰采购伊朗的石油。伊朗国家石油公司的商务董事帕海德工程师已在四月二十九日奉伊朗首相摩萨台之命由德黑兰前往日本，和那些希望购买伊朗石油的日本公司进行谈判并订合同。
    “今日东方报”估计：假若每年仅仅输出五百万吨的原油和三百万吨的石油产品，那么伊朗政府每年的收入，就要比最近几年内前英伊石油公司每年所付的租费收入增加一倍。前英伊石油公司最近几年每年产油三千万吨以上。
    伊朗政府的决定以及这个决定所引起的影响，已经使得英美的石油垄断资本家们非常恐慌，他们还在继续对已实行国有化的伊朗石油实行经济封锁，千方百计想强迫伊朗接受他们的条件以便占有伊朗的石油工业。
    德黑兰报纸指出：美国驻伊朗大使汉德逊于五月三日访晤首相摩萨台，在历时三小时的会谈中，汉德逊讲到伊朗政府把伊朗石油价格减低一半的决定所引起的不利影响。
    “世界报”说：汉德逊对于伊朗驻美大使赛拉的声明表示非常不满。赛拉曾在美国宣传伊朗政府的决定。
    伊朗报纸说：摩萨台在伊朗舆论的压力之下，拒绝英美所提出的要服从世界石油垄断资本家利益的要求。
