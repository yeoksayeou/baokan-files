Following its April 25th editorial, the Soviet "Pravda" published another extremely important editorial on May 24th, offering a very insightful and thorough analysis of the current complex international situation, which has received attention and praise from public opinion in various countries around the world. Because the firm stance taken by the Soviet Union in seeking peace and international cooperation is not only based on the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy, but also conforms to the peaceful aspirations and fundamental interests of the people of all countries in the world, it is also the only way to solve the current international problems. As the "Pravda" editorial pointed out: "Everyone knows how much interest and sympathy the recent statements by Soviet government leaders, expressing the Soviet Union's willingness to resolve international disputes or outstanding international issues on the basis of mutual agreement among the parties concerned, have aroused. These statements have strengthened the confidence of people of all countries in the possibility of resolving various pressing international issues, because they know that the Soviet government's statements never contradict its true intentions." Obviously, this "Pravda" editorial is a great encouragement to all peace-loving people.

The "Pravda" editorial pointed out: "The characteristic of the current international situation is that the various problems that must be solved are very complex, which requires people to properly understand those who believe that attempting to discuss and solve all controversial and outstanding issues at once is doomed to failure. Progress in solving difficult problems such as the Korean War or the German question can facilitate the easing of current international tensions and also prepare the ground for solving other problems." The editorial then stated: "The Korean issue is one of the most important international issues, and its peaceful resolution is of concern to the people of all countries." British Prime Minister Churchill also stated in his speech to the British House of Commons on May 11th that if the Korean peace issue and two or three other international issues could be resolved, international tensions in the coming years could be eased, and a new future could be opened up for the "security" and "prosperity" of all countries. Therefore, the current progress of the Korean armistice negotiations is an important test of whether the countries concerned have the sincerity to peacefully resolve international disputes.

It is known that China and North Korea have made consistent efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue during the nearly three years since the Korean War. Recently, due to the proposals of the Chinese and North Korean governments, and with the support of the Soviet Union, the Korean armistice negotiations were resumed. During this period, our side put forward two proposals on April 26th and May 7th respectively for the reasonable settlement of the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. Because the US side did not agree to send the prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated to neutral countries, our side's May 7th proposal adopted the US side's premise of keeping these prisoners of war in Korea. The public opinion of various countries in the world has expressed warm support for our proposal. British Prime Minister Churchill and Indian Prime Minister Nehru also believe that this is the basis for reaching a Korean armistice agreement. This fully demonstrates our sincerity in striving to reach an agreement as soon as possible and promoting the Korean armistice. Now, because the US side's "counter-proposal" has been resolutely rejected by the Chinese and North Korean sides and strongly opposed by public opinion in various countries, the US side has had to reconsider its "counter-proposal" and put forward a new plan. However, people cannot but seriously note that after the US side put forward this new plan, the Syngman Rhee clique openly violated the confidential nature of the administrative meeting and leaked the contents of the US side's new plan and the situation of the administrative meeting.

The "Pravda" editorial believes that Churchill's proposal to convene a summit meeting of major powers as soon as possible is constructive. However, even on the issue of the summit meeting of major powers, the "Western" countries have shown a lack of consistent sincerity in resolving international disputes or outstanding issues through consultation. President Eisenhower stated in his April 16th speech that "the United States is willing to do its part" to resolve international disputes, but that was just a peaceful gesture. Churchill's speech showed something different from Eisenhower's empty talk in this regard. He said, "A summit meeting of major countries should be convened quickly, without too much delay," and he believed that a few basic problems could be solved first, thereby easing the current international tensions. In particular, Churchill, unlike some American politicians, did not put forward any preconditions to the Soviet Union. Therefore, Churchill's proposal was met with a cold response from the US government, and especially attacked by those in the United States who were trying to maintain international tensions. However, "Pravda" supports Churchill's proposals. This once again demonstrates the Soviet Union's consistent policy of consolidating peace and international cooperation, and the Soviet government's repeated statements recently that the Soviet Union is willing to resolve international disputes through consultation.

However, the "Pravda" editorial also sharply exposed the facts that deserve people's vigilance, that is, the "Western" countries are planning to hold a summit meeting of the US, British, and French governments. The purpose of this meeting is completely contrary to the spirit of major powers resolving international disputes through consultation. It is just a new conspiracy of the "Western" countries to harm the Soviet Union, that is, to harm the principle of resolving international disputes through consultation, and to further deteriorate the international situation. American bourgeois newspapers openly reported that the Three-Power Conference was to formulate their so-called "common policy" or "consistent attitude" to present to the Soviet Union. The commentator of "Washington Post" bluntly wrote:

"The significance of the Three-Power Conference is that the United States will seek the opinions of Britain and France and form a strong anti-Soviet front with them." This is just as "Pravda" pointed out, it means that Churchill is in fact also departing from the spirit of his proposed "summit meeting." Such inconsistent words and deeds will not achieve any results.

Of course, people will see that the most stubborn force currently hindering the resolution of disputes through consultation among nations is the belligerent elements in the American ruling clique, such as Taft, the leader of the majority party in the US Senate. Ignoring the desire of the people of the world for peace, they are frantically clamoring to continue the war and oppose the resolution of international disputes through consultation. Just as the people of the world are eager to stop the Korean War and believe that our eight-point proposal on May 7th can serve as the basis for reaching an armistice agreement, Taft shouted that "even the most perfect ceasefire is absolutely unacceptable," and said, "We will withdraw from all future peace talks in Korea." When the United States continues to use the United Nations as a cover for carrying out aggressive wars and completely regards the United Nations as its own tool, Taft still feels dissatisfied. He wants the United States to "forget the United Nations" and "go it alone." He actually said: "We had better give up any idea of ​​working with the United Nations in the East and allow us to retain complete freedom of action." At the same time, just as public opinion in various countries in the world is calling for a summit meeting of major powers, Taft is clamoring that "the current government (referring to the US government) has a responsibility to try to maintain this worldwide alliance against the Soviet Union in front of the Soviet Union." He denigrates all demands for "solving problems with Russia and restoring as much trade as possible" as a manifestation of "the weakness of the entire anti-Russian military alliance." It is not difficult to see from this that the basic key to why the international situation is turbulent today and the major powers have been unable to resolve international disputes or outstanding international issues through peaceful consultations is that these belligerent elements in the United States are obstructing them. This cannot but affect the lack of sincerity shown by the US government in resolving international disputes, causing international tensions to not be eased quickly.

The "Pravda" editorial once again irrefutably shows that the Soviet Union is making tireless efforts to safeguard the cause of international peace. The Soviet government has consistently adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, and its words and deeds have always been consistent. The "Pravda" editorial said: "The Soviet Union is always willing to consider any proposal aimed at ensuring peace and promoting the widest possible economic and cultural relations between countries with the utmost seriousness and sincerity." This attitude of the Soviet government shows its sincerity in seeking international peace. If all governments have the same sincerity as the Soviet Union in seeking peace and international security, then all international disputes will not be difficult to resolve.

### 谋求解决目前国际问题的唯一途径

    谋求解决目前国际问题的唯一途径
    苏联“真理报”继四月二十五日的社论之后，五月二十四日又发表了一篇极为重要的社论，对目前复杂的国际形势作了非常精湛透辟的分析，受到世界各国公众舆论的重视和赞扬。因为苏联谋求和平与国际合作而采取的坚定立场，不仅是依据苏联一贯的和平外交政策，符合于世界各国人民的和平愿望和根本利益的，而且是解决目前国际问题的唯一途径。正如“真理报”的这篇社论中所指出的：“一般人都知道，苏联政府领袖最近发表的表明苏联愿意在有关方面彼此协议的基础上解决国际争端或悬而未决的国际问题的声明，引起了何等的兴趣及同情。这种声明加强了各国人民对于可能解决各项紧迫的国际问题的信心，因为他们知道苏联政府的声明决不与它的真正意图相违背的。”显然，苏联“真理报”的这个社论，对于一切爱好和平的人们，都是一个莫大的鼓舞。
    “真理报”的社论指出：“目前国际形势的特点是，必须解决的各种问题是很复杂的，这使人们必须对那些人给以正当的了解，他们认为：要企图一下子讨论和解决一切争论着的和悬而未决的问题，是注定要失败的。在解决像朝鲜战争或德国问题之类的困难问题中获得进展，就可以便利缓和目前国际形势的紧张局面，并也可为解决其他问题准备基础。”社论接着说：“朝鲜问题是最重要的国际问题之一，它的和平解决是一切国家的人民所关心的。”英国首相邱吉尔五月十一日在英国下议院发表的演说中，也认为如果能够解决朝鲜和平问题以及其他两三个国际问题，就可以缓和今后几年中的国际紧张关系，并可能为所有国家的“安全”和“繁荣”打开新的前途。因此，目前朝鲜停战谈判进展的情况，是对于有关国家有无和平解决国际争端诚意的一个重要的考验。
    人们知道，中朝两国在朝鲜战争以来将近三年的期间，为和平解决朝鲜问题作了一贯的努力。最近期间由于中朝两国政府的提议，并得到苏联的支持，而使朝鲜停战谈判重新恢复进行。在此期间，我方为合理地解决战俘遣返问题先后提出了四月二十六日及五月七日的两个方案。由于美方不赞成将不直接遣返的战俘送到中立国家去，我方五月七日的方案并采纳了美方将这些战俘留在朝鲜的前提。对于我方的这个方案，世界各国公众的舆论表示了热烈的赞成。英国邱吉尔首相和印度尼赫鲁总理也认为这是达成朝鲜停战协议的基础。这充分表现了我方争取早日达成协议并促成朝鲜停战的诚意。现在，由于美方的“反建议”受到中朝方面的坚决拒绝和各国公众舆论的强烈反对，就使美方不得不重新考虑它的“反建议”并提出了一个新方案。但是人们不能不严重地注意到在美方提出这个新方案之后，李承晚集团竟公然破坏行政性会议的秘密性质，泄露美方新方案的内容及行政性会议的情况。
    “真理报”社论对于邱吉尔所提出的迅速召开大国会议的建议，认为是具有建设性的。但是，就在大国会议这个问题上，也表现了“西方”国家缺乏协商解决国际争端或悬案的一致诚意。艾森豪威尔总统曾在四月十六日演说中表示“美国愿意尽它应尽的本分”来解决国际争端，可是那不过是一种和平姿态。邱吉尔的演说在这方面表现了和艾森豪威尔的空谈有所不同。他说：“应该迅速召开一次主要国家间的最高级会议，不要延搁太久”，他并认为可以先求解决几个基本问题从而缓和目前的国际紧张局势。特别是邱吉尔不像美国一些政治家那样，他并没有向苏联提出什么先决条件。因此，邱吉尔的建议遭到了美国政府的冷淡反应，尤其受到美国那些极力想保持国际紧张局势的人们的攻击。但是，“真理报”支持邱吉尔的这些建议。这就又一次表现了苏联一贯坚持的巩固和平和国际合作的政策，和苏联政府最近一再声明的苏联愿以协商方式解决国际争端的意愿。
    但是，“真理报”社论同时又尖锐地揭露了值得人们警惕的事实，即“西方”国家正在计划举行美、英、法三国政府的首脑会议。这个会议的目的与大国协商解决国际争端的精神完全相反，它只是“西方”国家的一种新的共谋，用以损害苏联亦即损害协商解决国际争端的原则，使国际局势更趋恶化。美国资产阶级报纸公开报道说，三国会议是要拟出它们的所谓“共同方针”或“一致的态度”来向苏联提出。“华盛顿邮报”的评论家更直言不讳地写道：
    “三国会议的意义是，美国将探求英国和法国的意见，并与他们一同结成坚强的对苏阵线”。这就正如“真理报”所指出的，它意味着邱吉尔事实上也正在离开他所提出的召开一个“最高级会议”的建议的精神。这样的言行不一致的做法，是不会得到任何的结果的。
    当然，人们都会看到，目前妨碍国际间以协商方式解决争端的最顽固的势力，是美国统治集团中的那些好战分子，如美国参议院多数党头子塔夫脱之流。他们不顾全世界人民渴求和平的愿望，正在疯狂地叫嚷要继续进行战争，反对协商解决国际争端。正当全世界人民渴望停止朝鲜战争，认为我方五月七日所提出的八点方案可以作为达成停战协议的基础的时候，塔夫脱却叫喊“即使是最完善的停战也是绝对不能令人满意的”，他说“我们将退出以后在朝鲜进行的一切和平谈判”。当美国继续利用联合国作掩护进行侵略战争、完全把联合国作为美国的御用工具的情况下，塔夫脱还觉得不称心，他还要美国“忘掉联合国”“单独干下去”；他竟说：“我们最好放弃在东方与联合国一起工作的任何想法，而使我们保留完全自由行动的权利”。同时，正当世界各国公众舆论要求举行大国会议的时候，塔夫脱竟叫嚣“现政府（指美国政府）有责任设法在苏联面前保持这个世界范围的对付苏联的联盟”，他诋毁所有“和俄国解决问题，恢复尽可能多的贸易”的要求，都是“整个反俄军事同盟的软弱”的表现。由此不难看出，今天国际局势之所以动荡不安，大国间迟迟不能进行用和平协商办法解决国际纠纷或悬而未决的国际问题的基本关键，就是美国的这些好战分子从中阻梗，这就不可能不影响到美国政府在解决国际纠纷中表现缺乏诚意，致使国际间的紧张局势不能迅速地和缓下来。
    苏联“真理报”的社论再一次无可辩驳地表明，苏联是毫不疲倦地努力维护国际和平事业的。苏联政府一贯坚持和平外交政策，言行始终一致。“真理报”的社论说：“苏联经常愿意极其严肃极其真诚地考虑任何以保证和平和促进各国间尽可能广泛的经济与文化关系为其目的的建议。”苏联政府的这个态度，表示它谋求国际和平的真诚。如果各国政府都有和苏联同样的谋求和平与国际安全的诚意，那末，国际间的一切争端就都不难迎刃而解。
