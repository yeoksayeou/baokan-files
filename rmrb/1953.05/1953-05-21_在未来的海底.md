    In the Future Seabed
    Soviet Union, U. Pavlov

    When I left Moscow, I had already heard a lot about the future seabed – the construction of the Kuibyshev Sea. Eager to see everything quickly, I made a special trip to the construction area. I asked Comrade Shchepanov, the director of the construction project, to help me understand some aspects of the construction project. He said to me:
    "You can go and find Foreman Korchiba. I don't think anyone can explain everything to you better than him. Korchiba is a very humorous person. He came here from the Volga-Don Canal… Alright, let's go, I can introduce you."
    When we entered the next room, Foreman Korchiba was quietly studying a design drawing. After he understood our intentions, he carefully rolled up the design drawing, took off his glasses, and said:
    "I am very happy, but it's best if we go directly to the construction site, where I can point things out to you and explain everything."
    …We walked along the hillside, the road lined with neatly stacked timber, iron stakes, wooden planks, and reinforced concrete frames.

    The sun had already hidden behind the peak of the slope. Below, the surface of the Volga River, not yet covered by the shadow of the peak, shimmered in the sunlight. On the pile of new earth, a black patch was visible, with excavators swinging their buckets. The sound of motors in the distance was as faint as the buzzing of mosquitoes. Nearby, at a sawmill, the buzzing of saws never stopped.

    Korchiba stopped beside a huge concrete pile built on the slope, turned to face the Volga River.
    "Do you know where we are now? At the bottom of the sea!" He said, his brownish-yellow, slightly white-speckled mustache twitching slightly, his eyes narrowing mysteriously.
    "At the bottom of the sea!" he repeated. "Don't think that there are trees, gardens, and houses all around now. In the future, this will be a vast expanse of water! The water level will rise ten meters right where we are standing. We need to speed up construction here, because the water will be flooding in soon."

    Korchiba walked closer to the concrete pile, took off his gloves, and gently tapped the gray concrete with concern, then said with a proud tone: "A wharf, this is a wharf built on dry land! I've built quite a few wharves in my life, on the Don, the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea… but if people had told me back then that wharves could be built on dry land, I wouldn't have believed it! But today it is a living reality." As Korchiba spoke, he unbuttoned the front of his white short coat, pulled out his tobacco pouch from his cotton trousers pocket, and calmly began to roll a cigarette…

    Work all around was proceeding vigorously: dump trucks rumbled as they unloaded stones, the motors of dredgers roared, and the booms of towering tower cranes, like outstretched arms, were carrying huge equipment and parts. The loudspeaker broadcast orders from the dispatch station.

    Right next to us, a powerful excavator was digging a depression. A heavy truck slowly approached it. The excavator lifted its large bucket over the truck and opened the bottom. Soil and sand poured into the truck bed, filling it in an instant, and then the large truck drove off elsewhere.

    Looking at this wharf built on dry land, one can't help but be amazed. The concrete berths, the breakwaters protruding from the flat ground, do look a bit strange, and the steps of the wharf towering above the ground are truly peculiar. Indeed, who could have imagined that by 1955, there would be an artificial sea here, five hundred kilometers long and forty kilometers wide!

    "Surprised?" Korchiba said. "I was surprised too! When we started building the first wharf on the dry grassland during the Volga-Don Canal project, it was also hard to believe! Just think, in that hot and dry grassland, you wouldn't be able to dig up any water even if you dug for a lifetime, but now we see for ourselves that there is a sea there. The water in the sea is boundless, with surging waves. If people take a boat a little further from the shore, they have to worry about capsizing! Now even fishermen are casting their nets there… So, I fully believe that this place will become like that soon."

    Korchiba took a deep breath, smiled slightly, and then said: "Therefore, everyone is willing to work—to build this beautiful scenery with their own hands!" As he said this, he nodded towards the excavator, and spread his hands to the side: "It's not just our group working here! Look, do you see that bridge over there? That bridge won't do either; it needs to be rebuilt. Because, you know, it won't be ordinary small boats passing through there in the future, but ocean liners. Now the bridge workers there are working hard, because time is pressing. Also, the train station here is too small; after all, this is going to become a seaport, so there will be more goods, and transportation will be busier, so the train station also needs to be expanded. In the future, we will also build shipyards, sailing clubs, and water sports fields here… If you come back in a year and a half, we won't be standing here, but we will be taking a speedboat out for a ride together."

    At this moment, a young man suddenly jumped out from behind the gray low wall of the berth. His shirt was covered with concrete, his face was flushed, and sweat was dripping from his forehead. It was clear that he had rushed over with something urgent.
    "Comrade Korchiba," he shouted, "there's something wrong with greenhouse number five. Please come immediately!"

    "Okay, I'll be right there, Zhirnov!" Korchiba responded hastily, then turned to me and said: "Please forgive me, I have something to do, and I can't accompany you to see the situation here anymore… Come to my house after dusk later. My wife will bake some pies, we'll have tea, and maybe even drink a toast… We live not far from here, in the town, in house number four on 'Volga-Don' street, room number six… I'll be waiting for you…"

    As he said these last few words, Korchiba was already on the road, but he kept waving goodbye to me.

    My eyes followed his receding figure for a long time, until his body disappeared into the vast twilight.

    At this moment, various noises of work came from the river. Countless lights had been lit at the construction sites of bridges and berths, and at various nearby construction sites, illuminating the sky above the fields. The magnificent night scene of the construction site reminded me again of what Foreman Korchiba had just said, and a great picture of the future ocean immediately appeared before my eyes, and in my ears, it seemed as if a familiar song was sounding:

    We live in this world,
    Just to turn myths into reality.…………(Attached picture)

    在未来的海底
    苏联  乌·巴甫洛夫
    当我离开莫斯科的时候，已听到很多关于未来的海底——古比雪夫海的建设工程的情形了。我急于想很快地看到一切，于是特地来到了建筑区。我请求建筑工程主任斯契潘诺夫同志帮助我了解一些建筑工程的情况。他对我说：
    “可以去找一下工长考尔契巴，我想除了他之外，恐怕没有一个人能更好地为你讲解一切了。考尔契巴是个很有风趣的人，他是从伏尔加河——顿河运河到我们这里来的……好了，咱们走吧，我可以替你介绍介绍”。
    当我们走进隔壁房间时，考尔契巴工长正在默默地研究着一个设计图样。当他知道了我们的来意后，就细心地卷起设计图样，取下了眼镜说：
    “我非常高兴，不过最好我们直接到工地去，在那里我再指给你们看并给你们讲解一切。”
    ……我们沿着山坡走去，路的两边堆满着整齐的木材、铁桩、木板和钢骨水泥架。
    这时，太阳已隐在斜坡的顶峰后面了。在下边，那还没有被峰影遮住的伏尔加河的河面，在阳光的照耀下闪烁着。在那堆满新土的泥堆上，呈现着一片黑色，掘土机正在挥动着槽斗。远处的马达声轻得几乎像蚊子叫一样。附近某处的电锯场里，正在不停地发出着嗡嗡的锯木声。
    考尔契巴在建筑在斜坡上的巨大的混凝土堆旁边站住了，转身面向着伏尔加河。
    “你知道我们现在在那儿？在海底！”他微动着棕黄而带有斑白色胡须的嘴唇，神秘地眯着眼睛说。
    “在海底！”他重复了一遍，“你不要以为现在四周都是树木、花园和房屋，将来这里将是一片汪洋大海呢！就在我们站立的地方，水位将上涨十公尺。这里需要赶快地建设，因为不久以后水就要灌进来了。”
    考尔契巴走近混凝土堆，脱下了手套，关切地轻轻敲着灰色的混凝土，然后带着骄傲的口气说：“码头，这是在旱地上修起来的一个码头！我一生中修过了不少码头了，在顿河，亚速海，黑海……但如果在那时候人们告诉我说要在旱地上修起码头来，那我才不会相信呢！但是今天这却已经是活生生的事实了。”考尔契巴一边说，一边扭开了他的白色短皮袄的前襟，从棉裤袋里摸出了烟袋，从容不迫地开始卷起烟来……
    四周的工作正进行得挺起劲：自动卸货车轰隆轰隆地把石块从车上倒下来，挖泥机的马达隆隆作声，高耸的塔形起重机的吊杆，像张开了的手臂一样，搬运着巨大的器材和零件。扩音器里广播着调度站的命令。
    就在我们的近旁，一架强力掘土机正在挖掘凹地。一辆重卡车蠕蠕地开近它。掘土机就把它的大槽斗举到卡车上空，打开了底板。泥土沙拉拉地倒进了车厢，一下子就装满了，于是大卡车又开往别处。
    瞧着这个在旱地上建造起来的码头，不禁令人感到惊奇。一处处的混凝土的泊船所，在平地上突出来的一道道防波堤，看来确实有点异样，而高耸在地面上的码头的阶梯也真够奇特。的确，谁能想得到，到一九五五年的时候，这里将有一个长五百公里，宽四十公里的人造海洋呢！
    “惊奇吗？”考尔契巴说：“我也曾惊奇过呢！当我们在伏尔加河—顿河运河的工程中开始在干旱的草原上建造起第一个码头来的时候，也真难以相信呢！你们想，在那酷热而干旱的草原上，即使挖
    一辈子也是挖不出水来的，但是现在我们自己就看到了，那里的草原上有了海。海里的水是一望无际，波涛汹涌。人们如果坐船离岸远一点的话，就得担心翻船哩！现在连捕鱼的人也在那里撒网了。……所以，我完全相信，不久之后这里也将会变成那样。”
    考尔契巴深深地吸了口气，微微一笑，接着又说道：“所以，大家都愿意工作——用自己的双手建设起这一片美景来！”说到这里，他向掘土机那边点一点头，并把两手向旁一摊：“也不光是我们这一伙人在这里干呢！瞧，你们瞧那边，看到那座桥吗？那座桥也不成，也得改造一下。因为，你们知道，将来要在那里经过的，不是普普通通的小船，而是海轮了。现在那里的桥工们正在加紧工作，因为时间是挺紧迫的了。还有，这里的火车站也要嫌小了，毕竟这里要变成一个海港呀，因此货物就要多起来，运输就要忙起来，所以火车站也得加以扩大。将来我们还要在这里造船坞，造帆艇俱乐部，和水上运动场……一年半之后，你们再来的话，那我们就不会站在这里，而要一起坐上汽艇出去逛一逛了。
    这时，从泊船所的灰色矮围墙那边，突然跳出了一个小伙子来，他的上衣沾满了混凝土，满面绯红，额上滴着汗珠，显然是有什么急事跑来的。
    “考尔契巴同志，”他在那里叫喊着，“第五号暖房有事情，请你马上就去！”
    “好，我马上就去，吉尔诺夫！”考尔契巴着忙地呼应着，接着转过身来对我说：“请你原谅，我有事，不能再陪你看这里的情形了……回头黄昏以后，你再到我家里来。我的妻子会烘一些馅饼，我们喝喝茶，也许还可以痛饮一杯呢……我们住的地方离这里不远，就在镇上，‘伏尔加—顿’街四号住宅的六号房间……我等着你来……”
    说着这最后几句话的时候，考尔契巴已经走在路上了，但还是不断地向我挥手告别。
    我的眼睛久久地望着他的后影，直到他的身子消失在苍茫的暮色里。
    这时，河上传来了各式各样的工作的嘈杂声。在桥梁和泊船所的建筑工地上，在附近的各个工地上，已亮起了无数盏灯火，把原野的上空照耀得通明。工地的壮丽的夜景，使我又想起了考尔契巴工长刚才说过的那段话，于是一幅未来海洋的伟大图景立刻浮现在我的眼前，而在我的耳际，好像响起了一支熟悉的歌声：
    我们活到这个世界上来，
    就是为了把神话变成事实。…………（附图片）
