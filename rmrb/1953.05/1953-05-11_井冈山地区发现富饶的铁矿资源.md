Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 8th: Geological workers and drilling workers active in the Jinggang Mountains area have reached a gratifying conclusion: the Jinggang Mountains area, the cradle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is actually a rich iron ore warehouse of our motherland! The iron layers here are all sedimentary hematite, deposited by shallow seas about 300 million years ago. The area where the iron layers are distributed is very wide. Some iron layers are exposed on the outside, stretching from the mountainside all the way to the foot of the mountain, and inserting into the basin. The quality of the iron is very good, and the thickest part of the iron layer is nine meters, which is rare for such thick sedimentary iron ore in our country.
    The Jinggang Mountains area spans Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, including Yongxin, Shanglianhua in Jiangxi, and Chaling counties in Hunan, covering hundreds of miles, with towering mountains and red basins nestled between them. In the early days of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, first established a revolutionary base here. In the spring of 1951, a group of geological workers led by geological engineer Liao Shifan came here to explore. In order to search for iron layer outcrops, they crossed many mountains and often haunted cliffs and steep walls where wild animals roamed and humans were scarce. They repeatedly studied the stratum distribution of each system of strata in these places, the ancient geography here, and the folds and faults in the geological structure. The paleobiological fossils collected by just one team among them filled a box, and the ore samples collected filled two warehouses. After these vast surface survey work, they concluded that these areas contain very rich iron layers. However, because the iron layers were formed a long time ago and have undergone several crustal movements, resulting in severe folding and complex structures, some situations are difficult to clarify through surface surveys. Therefore, starting from last autumn, they carried out large-scale trench exploration work. Last winter, drilling work also began.
    Good news kept coming from the drilling site. One drilling team continuously drilled twenty boreholes, and each borehole encountered an iron layer.
    Currently, exploration work in the Jinggang Mountains area is proceeding intensively, and several geological surveys are also about to begin. The Jinggang Mountains area, which once nurtured the People's Liberation Army and promoted the revolutionary cause of our country, will now use its rich iron ore resources to promote the process of our country's industrialization.

### 井冈山地区发现富饶的铁矿资源

    井冈山地区发现富饶的铁矿资源
    【新华社南昌八日电】活跃在井冈山地区的地质工作者和钻探工人们已经得出了一个可喜的结论：我国人民解放军的摇篮——井冈山地区，原来是我们祖国的一个富饶的铁仓！这里的铁层都是水成赤铁矿，大约是在三万万年以前由浅海沉积起来的。铁层分布的面积很广。有些铁层显露在外面从山腰一直伸展到山脚下，插入盆地。铁的质量很好，铁层最厚的地方达九公尺，这样厚的水成铁矿在我国还是不多的。
    井冈山地区横跨江西、湖南两省，包括江西的永新、上莲花和湖南的茶陵等县，纵横几百里，其中遍布着丛山峻岭，红色盆地夹居其间。第二次国内革命战争初期，我国人民在毛主席领导下首先在这里建立了革命根据地。一九五一年春，以地质工程师廖士范等为首的一群地质工作者来到这里勘探。为了搜索铁层露头，他们翻越了许多山岭，经常出没在野兽成群人烟稀少的悬崖陡壁间。他们反复研究了这些地方的地层各层系的岩层分布情形，这里的古代地理和地质构造中的摺绉断层等情况。只他们中间的一个队所采取到的古生物化石，就装满了一箱子，采取到的矿石样品装满了两个仓库。经过了这些浩繁的地面调查工作以后，他们断定：这些地区储藏着很丰富的铁层。但由于铁层形成的年代已经很久，经过了几次地壳运动的变迁，致铁层摺绉剧烈，构造复杂，有些情况在地面调查很难弄清楚。因此，从去年秋天起，他们进行了大规模的槽探工作。去年冬季又开始进行了钻探工作。
    捷报不断地从钻探工地上传出来。有一个钻探队连续打了二十个钻眼，每个钻眼都遇到了铁层。
    现在井冈山区的勘探工作正在紧张进行，若干地质普查工作也快要开始。曾经抚育了人民解放军，推进了我国革命事业的井冈山地区，现在又将要用它的富饶铁矿资源来推进我国工业化的进程。
