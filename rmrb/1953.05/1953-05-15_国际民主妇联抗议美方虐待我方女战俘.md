Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 14th: The Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) has sent an angry protest to U.S. President Eisenhower, denouncing the barbaric mistreatment of Chinese and Korean female prisoners of war by the U.S. military. The protest stated: "One hundred and thirty-five million women in sixty-five countries are outraged to learn of the barbaric threats against Chinese and Korean female prisoners of war, including physical abuse to prevent their repatriation. They demand that the perpetrators be punished and that the intimidation of prisoners of war be stopped."

In issuing this protest, the WIDF stated: The U.S. negotiators at Panmunjom, in order to cover up their crimes of mistreating Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, are refusing to allow the prisoners of war to return home; this attempt of theirs will never succeed. Honest people everywhere are raising their voices in protest, demanding that the U.S. Command in Korea stop these atrocities and acts of intimidation.

    国际民主妇联抗议美方虐待我方女战俘
    【新华社柏林十四日电】国际民主妇女联合会向美国总统艾森豪威尔发出愤怒的抗议，斥责美国军队对中国和朝鲜女战俘的野蛮虐待。抗议书说：“六十五个国家的一亿三千五百万妇女，闻悉野蛮威胁中国和朝鲜女战俘的行为，其中包括为了阻止她们的遣返而加以肉体虐待的行为，莫不感到愤怒。她们要求惩罚犯罪者，终止威吓战俘。”
    国际民主妇女联合会在发表这个抗议书时说：美国在板门店的谈判代表为掩盖他们虐待朝中战俘的罪行，拒绝让战俘们回国，他们这个企图是决不会成功的。各地正直的人们都在发出抗议的呼声，要求在朝鲜的美国司令部停止这些暴行和威胁的行为。
