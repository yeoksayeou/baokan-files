Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 7th—The repatriated sick and wounded personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are returning to the country one after another. From May 5th to 7th, 674 people in three groups have arrived in the motherland.

　　When the sick and wounded were transported to a certain hospital, medical personnel immediately helped them out of the vehicles. Everything in this modernized hospital of the motherland has been well prepared for them. The sick and wounded were first placed in the rest room by nurses, and doctors performed detailed diagnoses and treatments. After necessary procedures such as disinfection, haircutting, fluoroscopy, and blood transfusions, the sick and wounded were placed in spacious wards with plenty of light. The sick and wounded lay in clean white beds, reading newspapers, magazines, and picture books from the motherland. At mealtimes, nursing staff brought aquatic products such as fish and shrimp from the motherland. Nurses cared for them around the clock, and the hospital reissued summer clothing to the sick and wounded, and everyone also received new leather shoes.

　　The joyful mood of the sick and wounded returning to the motherland is indescribable. Tears welled up in their eyes whenever they talked to people about everything in the motherland, feeling that there were thousands of words they could not express. A sick and wounded person wrote in his diary: I have returned to the embrace of the motherland and see that the construction of the motherland is already stronger and more beautiful. The sick and wounded expressed: In the past, our bodies were on Geoje Island, but our hearts were with the motherland. They brought back the national flag of our country that once fluttered on Geoje Island, and hidden in their pockets were red five-pointed star badges made from canned food boxes in the prisoner-of-war camp. They had painfully cut off the humiliating words forcibly branded by the enemy during the screening process, and the scars on their left arms were still visible. In the struggle to insist on complete repatriation, they had their limbs cruelly amputated by the enemy. In the prisoner-of-war camp, they made artificial legs and military uniforms themselves. The sick and wounded returned to the motherland with all of this. This is a historical testimony to their heroic struggle.

　　After returning to the motherland, the repatriated sick and wounded personnel revealed in their words that their only wish was to recover their health and immediately participate in the construction of the motherland.

    被遣返的志愿军病伤人员陆续返回祖国
    【新华社安东七日电】被遣返的中国人民志愿军病伤人员陆续归国，从五月五日到七日已经有六百七十四人分三批到达祖国。
    病伤人员被运送到某医院时，医务人员即扶持着他们下车。这座祖国近代化的医院，一切都早为他们准备妥善。病伤员们被护士先安放在休息室里，由医生进行详细的诊疗。在经过消毒、理发和透视、输血等必要的程序后，病伤员们被安置到宽敞的病房里，这里光线十分充足。病伤员们躺在洁白的病床上，阅读着祖国的报纸、杂志和画报。开饭时，护理人员端来了祖国的水产鱼虾。护士们彻夜不眠地照顾他们，医院给病伤员们补发了夏季服装，每个人还领到了新皮鞋。
    回到祖国的病伤员们喜悦的心情是无法形容的。他们每当和人们谈到祖国的一切时就流出了眼泪，感到千言万语无从说起。一个病伤人员在日记上写道：我又回到了祖国的怀抱，看到祖国建设已经更强大更美丽。病伤人员表示：我们过去是人在巨济岛，心在祖国。他们带回来曾飘扬在巨济岛上的我国国旗。兜中藏着有在俘虏营中用罐头盒子制成的五角红星军徽。他们曾用刀忍痛挖掉敌人强迫甄别刺上的污辱字句，左臂上的伤痕还历历在目。他们在坚持全部遣返的斗争中，被敌人残酷地截去了四肢。他们在俘虏营中，自己制造了假腿和军服。病伤人员带着这一切回到祖国。这是他们英勇斗争的历史见证。
    被遣返的病伤人员回到祖国后，在言语中流露出他们的唯一愿望是：恢复健康后马上参加祖国的建设。
