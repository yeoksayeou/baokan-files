Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, was unable to attend due to illness, and the meeting unanimously passed a letter of condolence.

Then Zhang Lan delivered the opening speech. First, on behalf of the China Democratic League, he paid the highest respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party! He said: This meeting is the largest meeting held since the enlarged meeting of the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Democratic League. Over the past three and a half years, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our country and people have achieved brilliant victories and achievements. The China Democratic League has honorably participated in various political movements, social reforms, and democratic reform movements, making certain contributions to the country and the people. Zhang Lan then said: This year, the country has entered a new period of construction. The China Democratic League must work hard under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party to complete the country's three major tasks. Most of our league members are cultural and educational workers, so we must actively participate in the country's cultural and educational construction, which is our central task now. In addition, comrades working in government agencies should also strictly abide by national discipline, intensify their studies, and strive to do their work well and complete the tasks assigned to us by the state. The China Democratic League is a New Democratic party, and we must work hard to build a New Democratic country and move towards socialism. In order to do our work well, we must strengthen unity, strengthen leadership, and improve organizational structures. After pointing out the achievements and shortcomings in the work of the China Democratic League in recent years, Zhang Lan called on all league members present to actively promote the spirit of democracy, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and put forward constructive opinions. He said: All league comrades must unite more closely and seek progress together. We must do everything from the perspective of work, not compete for personal fame and fortune, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

In his speech, Guo Moruo expressed the hope that the Democratic League could carry forward its past achievements and make further efforts to consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front; he hoped that the Democratic League could urge its members to do their jobs well with a positive and responsible attitude, especially in participating in cultural and educational work. In order to achieve the above goals, Guo Moruo said: It is necessary to ensure that the organization and members of the Democratic League can constantly make progress, unite, distinguish between enemies and friends, and distinguish between right and wrong; learn to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism.

In his speech, Li Jishen said: Over the past three years, the political consciousness of the members of the democratic parties has been continuously improved through the exercise of various political movements and social reform movements, and the ideological transformation movement of intellectuals has achieved great success. This should first be attributed to the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Li Jishen then put forward several specific suggestions on how the democratic parties should mobilize, urge and help their members to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity in various positions, and then drive the masses they are connected with, abide by national discipline, and complete national tasks. He finally stated that this conference is not only of great significance to the future work of the China Democratic League, but will also be of great help to the work of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

In his speech, Huang Yanpei reported to the representatives of the Democratic League on the work done by the China Democratic National Construction Association in uniting and educating the national bourgeoisie in recent years, as well as the future measures. He also mentioned that the reason why the work of the Democratic National Construction Association has made progress in recent years is because it has followed the spirit of strengthening internal unity and strengthening cooperation with all relevant parties, and this spirit has also been consistently followed by the Democratic League. Finally, he congratulated the conference on its complete success on behalf of the Democratic National Construction Association.

The opening ceremony ended at 11:00 a.m. From this afternoon, the meeting entered the agenda of various reports and discussions, including the main political report, league affairs report, report on revising the league charter, and discussions on these reports.
