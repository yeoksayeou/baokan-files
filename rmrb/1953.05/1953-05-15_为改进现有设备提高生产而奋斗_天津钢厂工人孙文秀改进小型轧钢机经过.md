Striving to Improve Existing Equipment and Increase Production
—The Story of Sun Wenxiu, a Worker at Tianjin Steel Plant, Improving a Small Rolling Mill
Tianjin Steel Plant Research Office

Sun Wenxiu is a veteran technical worker in the First Branch of Tianjin Steel Plant, with over ten years of rolling experience. He believed that the small rolling mill had untapped potential and began researching improvements to the rolling mill in 1950. He had a limited education and explored on his own. He had difficulty with calculations and was unable to reach a conclusion for a long time, but he persisted in his research. In early 1952, to further his research, Sun Wenxiu collected steel materials rolled by each stage of the rolling mill (cutting off a small section) as research data. He studied methods to improve the machine by comparing the cut pieces with the rolling groove types (referred to as rolling grooves). He also visited brother teams during his off-duty hours to absorb more experience. After more than half a year of careful study, he preliminarily concluded that the main reason for frequent defective products was unsuitable rolling grooves, and that improving the rolling grooves was key to improving quality and ensuring safe production.

Workers working on the second stand of the small rolling mill face a high risk of injury. Red-hot steel bars pass under the workers' arms, and a slight oversight can lead to serious work-related injuries. Sun Wenxiu worked here, and based on his practical experience and two years of research, he identified the key to improving the rolling grooves. The rolling force of the eleventh and twelfth rolling grooves in the second stand was not significant. The steel bar passed through them between the tenth and thirteenth rolling grooves, which was equivalent to an idle pass. By finding a way to eliminate these two passes and balancing the dimensions of the rolling grooves before and after, not only could safe operation be achieved, but the machine-hour output could be greatly increased.

Sun Wenxiu found the key and gained more confidence. From late June 1952, he used his off-duty time to organize original data, calculate groove dimensions, and prepare written explanations. However, he encountered great difficulties at this time: first, he had to make accurate calculations of the theoretical dimensions, actual dimensions, and corrected dimensions of each groove; second, he had to figure out how to ensure the rolling force was balanced in the rolling grooves before and after eliminating the two passes. With his level of education, making such technical calculations was extremely difficult! Sun Wenxiu said, "When I was calculating, I reversed from the beginning to the end, and when I couldn't reverse in the middle, I would go back and start over again. I don't know how many times I reworked it." He sometimes researched until late at night without sleeping, disturbing his wife and children. He thought about it while eating, and he thought about it while walking on the road. Once, an electrical worker, Tian Weiqing, greeted Sun Wenxiu from a distance on the road, but Sun Wenxiu didn't hear him at all. As Sun Wenxiu's wife said, "He was simply obsessed!" He painstakingly studied and calculated precisely, spending a full seventeen days before making a rationalization proposal and submitting it to the Rationalization Proposal Committee.

Technician Lan Chongqiu did not give Sun Wenxiu's proposal enough attention and returned it to him. Sun Wenxiu repeatedly requested help from the foreman and team leader in writing and orally, but they did not even look at it, did not forward it to higher authorities, nor did they submit it to the team meeting for discussion. One team leader even pointed to the steel heads cut off by Sun Wenxiu and said with malicious sarcasm: "No wonder we can't complete the task (in fact, they overfulfilled the task every month), it's all because you keep cutting off the heads." Sun Wenxiu's hard-earned results of two years of research were suppressed for half a year. At the end of the year, Sun Wenxiu became ill and was hospitalized. The factory director, the party general branch secretary, and the chairman of the trade union visited the hospital to give gifts and express their concern to the patient. The factory director shook hands with him and talked to him. Sun Wenxiu was very moved and resolved to realize his proposal. After Sun Wenxiu was discharged from the hospital, he discussed the proposal with fellow workers and received support from party members and members of the Communist Youth League in the workshop. The team leader and deputy team leader of Team A, upon learning of the proposal, proactively approached the leadership and requested support. Comrades from the trade union group of Team C also reported to the trade union, requesting the union's support. Sun Wenxiu himself also submitted his proposal in person to the chairman of the trade union and Tong Jiazhang, the newly appointed member of the Rationalization Proposal Committee (a cadre promoted from among the workers). His proposal immediately attracted the attention of the factory leadership and received strong support. Engineer Song Hanmin, the factory director, helped Sun Wenxiu with research and calculations on technical theory and personally participated in team meetings to resolve individual workers' ideological issues. Chen Yuhua, the deputy director, also announced in the workshop: "We will definitely give 100% support to Sun Wenxiu's proposal." Cheng Jingguo, the deputy director of production, said at a meeting of the guard shift: "We must concentrate our efforts to help Sun Wenxiu conduct experiments from a technical perspective." The party branch held several branch meetings, explaining the advanced nature of Sun Wenxiu's proposal and criticizing the incorrect thinking of individual comrades. The chairman of the trade union also provided various support. At the end of February and the beginning of April this year, two groove modification experiments were conducted, taking advantage of the time after completing the task. The results were very good. During the second experiment, the factory director and deputy director, engineers, and workers who were off work and on leave all came. Seeing the success of the experiment, some workers jumped for joy, saying: "In the future, we will no longer have the risk of burns and injuries during operation." Some workers said: "We can also go to the second stand to learn operating techniques in the future."

During the second experiment (early April), employees were discussing the 1953 plan. Based on Sun Wenxiu's proposal, the workers formulated their own plan, which increased the machine-hour output by more than 10% compared to the original plan, and reduced steel ingot burning loss by 27%. His proposal not only increased production, but also overcame the "folding" defect of steel materials and improved quality because the groove shape was appropriate. In terms of labor organization, it averaged the workload, overcoming the past shortcomings of some workers being too tired and others being too light, allowing workers to rotate and improve everyone's technical level more quickly. Now, the workers in the small rolling mill workshop of the First Branch are all overjoyed at the success of Sun Wenxiu's proposal. Whenever this matter is mentioned, they are always happy to stick up their thumbs and tell you these benefits, finally adding: "The benefits are endless, comrade!"

Sun Wenxiu's courage in painstakingly studying and not fearing difficulties set a good example for all the workers in the workshop. A wave of rationalization proposals has been launched in the entire workshop. During this plan formulation, workers put forward more than 60 suggestions, including more than 20 suggestions on mechanization and automation, such as automatic loading of steel heating furnaces, automatic coal addition, anti-reverse discs, automatic steel cutting machines, and so on. After work, workers gather in groups of three or two to conduct research. Recently, the suggestion of Li Hai, an inspector from the Technical Supervision Station, on improving the rolling grooves of the large rolling mill was put forward under the influence of Sun Wenxiu's suggestion.

When others talk about these contributions, Sun Wenxiu always says:

"What is this little improvement? It is still far from the requirements of the country! We must continue to improve existing equipment, continuously increase production, and catch up with the requirements of the country."

    为改进现有设备提高生产而奋斗
    ——天津钢厂工人孙文秀改进小型轧钢机经过
    天津钢厂研究室
    孙文秀是天津钢厂一分厂的老技术工人，有十余年轧钢经验。他认为小型轧钢机还有潜在能力没有充分发挥，从一九五○年就开始研究改进轧钢机的工作。他文化水平不高，自己摸索，在计算上有困难，很久不能作出结论，但一直坚持研究工作。到一九五二年初，孙文秀为了更进一步进行研究，搜集每一道轧钢机轧出的钢料（切下一小截）作为研究的资料，根据切头对照轧辊槽型（简称轧槽）研究改进机器的方法；并利用下班时间到兄弟组中参观，吸收更多的经验。他经过半年以上的精心钻研，初步得出结论：经常出废品次品的主要原因是轧槽不合适；改进轧槽是提高质量和进行安全生产的关键。
    在小型轧钢机的第二档工作的工人，操作时很危险，通红的钢条在工人的胳臂下穿来穿去，稍不留神，就会发生严重的工伤事故。孙文秀就在这里工作，他根据实际操作经验和二年来的研究心得，找出了改进轧槽的关键。二档的第十一和第十二两个轧槽的轧力并不大，钢条从第十轧槽到第十三轧槽当中经过，等于白走两道。设法减去这两道，把前后各道轧槽在尺度上加以平衡，不但可以做到安全操作，还可以大大增加机时产量。
    孙文秀找出了窍门，信心更高了，从一九五二年六月下旬起，他利用下班的时间，整理原始资料，计算槽孔，并作出书面说明。但，这时他碰到了极大的困难：第一，必须对每一槽孔的理论尺度，实际尺度及修正尺度作出精确的计算；第二，怎样作到减去两道轧槽后使前后轧槽轧力均衡。凭他的文化程度，作出这样技术性的计算工作，是多么困难啊！孙文秀说：“我在计算时，从头向后倒，到中途倒不过时，再回头重倒，也不知翻工多少次。”他有时研究到深夜也不睡觉，搅得他的爱人和孩子也睡不安身。他吃饭时在想，走在马路上也在想，有次电气工田维清在马路上老远就和孙文秀打招呼，可是孙文秀根本没有听见。正如孙文秀的爱人所说：“他简直是入迷啦！”他就这样苦苦钻研，精确计算，整整费去十七天工夫，他才作出合理化建议，提交合理化建议委员会。
    技术员兰崇丘对孙文秀的建议没有给予足够的重视，他把这个建议退回孙文秀。孙文秀曾不止一次地用书面和口头请求工长、组长帮助，但他们连看也不看，不转交给上级，也不转交小组会研究。有一个组长还指着孙文秀切下的钢头带着恶意的讽刺口吻说：“怪不得我们完不成任务（其实每月都超额完成任务），都叫你给切头切去啦。”孙文秀辛辛苦苦地研究两年得来的成果，就这样给压了半年。到了年底孙文秀生病住在医院里，厂长、党总支书记、工会主席到医院给病人送礼慰问，厂长和他握手谈话。孙文秀很感动，下决心一定要把建议实现。孙文秀出院后拿着建议和工人同志研究，得到车间党员、团员的支持。甲班正副组长知道这一建议后，主动向领导方面提出，请求给予支持；丙班工会小组同志也到工会反映，请求工会支持；孙文秀本人也把自己的建议当面提交工会主席和新任合理化建议委员会的委员佟嘉章（从工人中提拔的干部）。他的建议立即引起该厂领导方面的重视，并得到大力的支持。厂主任宋汉民工程师，在技术理论上帮助孙文秀研究计算，还亲自到车间参加小组会，打通个别工人的思想；副主任陈玉华并在车间宣布：“我们一定拿出百分之百的力量来支持孙文秀的建议。”生产副主任程靖国在参加护车组会议时说：“我们一定集中力量从技术方面帮助孙文秀进行试验。”党支部召开了几次支部会议，说明孙文秀建议的先进性，批评个别同志的不正确思想；工会主席也给予多方支持。今年二月底及四月初利用两次完成任务后的时间，做了两次改槽试验，结果很好。在第二次试验时，正副厂长和工程师们及下了班和公休的工人都来了，看到试验成功，有的工人乐得直跳，说：今后我们在操作时再也不会有烫伤碰伤的危险了。有的工人说：以后我们也可以到二档学习操作技术了。
    在第二次试验时（四月初），职工正在讨论一九五三年计划。工人们根据孙文秀的建议，订出自己的计划，比原订计划机时产量又提高了百分之十以上，钢锭烧损又降低了百分之二十七。他这个建议不但提高了产量，因为孔型适当，还克服了钢材的“折叠”缺陷，提高了质量。在劳动组织方面使工作负荷平均，克服了过去累的太累，轻的太轻的缺点，使工人可以循环工作，更快地提高每一个人的技术水平。现在一分厂小型轧钢车间的工人都为孙文秀的建议试验成功感到欢欣鼓舞，只要提起这一件事，他们总高兴得翘起大姆指向你说出这些好处，最后还要加上这样一句：好处说不完啦，同志！
    孙文秀刻苦钻研不怕困难的勇气，给全车间工人同志作了很好的榜样。全车间掀起了合理化建议的热潮。这次订计划中工人提出六十多件建议，其中有二十几件是关于机械化、自动化的建议，如烘钢炉自动装料、自动加煤、反围盘、自动切钢机等等。工人在下班后都三个一堆，两个一伙地进行研究。最近技术监督站检验员李海关于改进大轧钢机轧槽的建议，就是在孙文秀建议的影响下提出的。
    当别人谈到这些贡献时，孙文秀总是这样说：
    “这一点改进算什么呢，距离国家要求还远呢！我们还要继续改进现有设备，不断提高生产，赶上国家的要求。”
