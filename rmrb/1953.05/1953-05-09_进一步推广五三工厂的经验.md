    Further Promote the Experience of Factory 53
    Northeast Federation of Trade Unions
    We have recently learned about the promotion of the experience of Factory 53 in factories and mines in Shenyang, Fushun, Fuxin, Anshan, and other places. The Party committees of these cities attach importance to the promotion of the experience of Factory 53. The experience of Factory 53 has been repeatedly emphasized in many important meetings and documents. The Fushun and Fuxin municipal Party committees also organized working groups to carry out key pilot projects and achieved results. Wherever serious study and promotion have been carried out, there have been some gains, and it has been realized that "the experience of Factory 53 really solves problems." For example, the leading cadres of Workshop 1 of Factory 121 are "newer" than those of other workshops, but because they often seriously study and apply the experience of Factory 53, the work of this workshop is better than that of other workshops. Other units that have studied seriously have also made the thinking and steps of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the enterprise more consistent, and political and ideological work has been strengthened. However, on the whole, the work of promoting the experience of Factory 53 in these cities has not been universally carried out. The trade unions in these cities have also not earnestly and actively carried out this work. At present, the situation of this work is roughly as follows: there are general calls, but a lack of specific guidance; the propaganda departments of the Party committees are paying close attention, so more has been learned in terms of propaganda, but very little has been learned in terms of organizational construction; some experiences have been learned in a piecemeal and fragmented manner, but the comprehensive and systematic study of the experience of Factory 53 is very poor. In addition, there are also deviations such as formal imitation and mechanical application, without paying attention to learning its basic spirit and essence.
    Since last December, after the National Trade Union Grassroots Work Conference and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the "Decision on Promoting the Experience of Factory 53 in Trade Union Work," it has attracted the attention of trade union leaders in various cities. At present, they have begun to organize cadres of the municipal Federation of Trade Unions to study the experience of Factory 53 (some have already completed the study), and formulate plans for studying and promoting the experience of Factory 53 in trade union work throughout the city; some have also organized working groups, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and begun to carry out key pilot projects.
    In the past period, several factories and mines in these cities—the Shenyang Smelter, the Fuxin Ping'an Drilling Team, two pit mouths of the Fushun Victory Mine Open-pit Mine, the Anshan Electrical Repair Factory, and the Steelmaking Plant—have achieved significant results and gained some experience in studying and promoting the experience of Factory 53.
    First, solve ideological problems. When these factories began to promote the experience of Factory 53, they all encountered such ideological obstacles: "The experience of Factory 53 was summarized by the higher authorities. Our work here is also good, and we complete and exceed the tasks every month. We also have good experience, but no one comes to summarize it."
    (There is a lot of this blind complacency in some factories in Northeast China) Or they emphasize objective conditions: "The experience of Factory 53 is good, but it cannot solve the problems here." When they slightly know the rich content of the experience of Factory 53, they show conservative fear of difficulties and lack of confidence: "The experience of Factory 53 has been accumulated over several years, it is too deep, too much, and difficult to learn." At the beginning of the study, because they did not have a good understanding of the basic content and basic spirit of the experience of Factory 53, these ideas were generated. An effective way to solve these ideological problems is to organize cadres to seriously study the relevant documents introducing the experience of Factory 53 under the unified leadership of the Party, and compare and check them according to the "Resolution of the Northeast Bureau on the Party's Leadership over State-owned Enterprises." In this way, cadres will find that the experience of Factory 53 is a concrete implementation of the above-mentioned resolution, and that their units are far behind in this regard; they will naturally have the desire to learn from Factory 53. For example, the Shenyang Smelter, the Third District of the West Well of the Victory Mine, and Factory 671, which have achieved better learning results, have all gone through such a process. The study must be planned, and given more time (generally one hour per day), starting with organizing cadres who are separated from production to study. After studying the documents and clarifying the basic ideological viewpoints, we can prepare the ideological foundation for promoting the many specific experiences of Factory 53. Such as carrying out criticism and self-criticism under the leadership of the Party to ensure the consistency of ideological steps and give play to the role of various organizations of the enterprise; strengthening political and ideological leadership to combine political work with economic work; taking production as the center, and doing a good job in the integration of production, life, and education, etc. It has been proven that it is not possible to promote the experience of Factory 53 without studying or hastily studying the documents of Factory 53 experience, or promoting it not consciously but with a perfunctory attitude. For example, the leading cadres of the Fushun Laohutai Mine Trade Union thought that they had visited Factory 53, and only explained it briefly when they came back, and did not seriously study and check the work, so they went to promote it, and the result was failure.
    Second, solve the problem of "where to start learning." The experience of several successful learning units proves that starting from solving the existing practical problems, that is, learning and using the experience of Factory 53 to solve the current key practical problems of the factory and mine, is the best "learning entry." Last year, the more common practice was to use Factory 53's ideological investigation and ideological comparison to inspire the masses to be conscious and use advanced experiences to drive the backward in the work of promoting advanced experiences. Therefore, the advanced experience was promoted and the completion of the production increase and conservation task was guaranteed. Because of the effectiveness of learning, everyone later paid attention to using methods such as ideological investigation and typical demonstration in many tasks. For example, in January this year, the lead electrolysis workshop of the Smelter learned and specifically applied the experience of Factory 53, and successfully mobilized the masses to discuss the state production plan. This has greatly improved the work style of grassroots cadres who did not go deep into the masses and only made general appeals. Some units (such as the Fuxin Drilling Team) learned and applied the experience of Factory 53, and first solved the ideological problem of uncoordinated relations between the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League. Starting to learn "from reality" can solve practical problems, not only can it avoid the bias of formalism and mechanical imitation, but also gradually improve the interest and confidence of cadres in learning the experience of Factory 53. On this basis, it is not difficult to move forward to achieve comprehensive and systematic learning.
    Third, solve the problem of "sticking to it." How to consolidate the effectiveness of learning the experience of Factory 53? The experience is: we must use the activists among the masses and give play to the organizational role of various organizations of the enterprise. The study of the experience of Factory 53, from the promotion by cadres to the activists, is still a very important organizational construction work. The better practices and achievements of these units are to establish and improve the Party's propaganda network and the trade union's cultural and educational committee organization, so that political and ideological education work and production mobilization work are regularized; to establish meeting points and a reasonable distribution of spare time, so that the unity of ideological steps is guaranteed; to establish a system for cadres to study for one hour every day and go to workshops to visit employees' dormitories, so that the work style of close ties with the masses is always maintained... Although there are not many units that have reached this level, and even those that have done it are not doing it completely; however, it is an important experience that must be done without a doubt.
    Fourth, solve the leadership problem of promotion work. Several units that have learned well (especially the key pilot units) are led by the Party committee in a unified manner, organizing the forces of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League within the enterprise to work together. Although the key pilot working group of some units is only the force of one department (such as the propaganda department of the Party committee), when they go to the key pilot places, they inevitably organize the forces of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League in that place to carry out unified operations (such as the Third District of the West Well of the Fushun Victory Mine). Doing so is absolutely necessary, because doing so itself embodies a very important aspect of the experience of Factory 53: solving the problem of unifying thinking and unifying steps from the leadership. Conversely, some units (such as Shenyang Machinery Factory 1) did not do this, but asked the lower levels (workshops) to learn the experience of Factory 53, and as a result, the upper levels were not unified, causing many difficulties for the lower levels. Some cadres said: "The leaders haven't learned it well yet, how can we learn it well?" For example, the Fushun Steelmaking Plant was organized by the Communist Youth League to study; the Electrician Factory 10 was organized by the cultural and educational department of the trade union to study, and neither of them obtained the unified leadership and support of the Party committee, and as a result, it could not be promoted.
    How to further study and promote the experience of Factory 53? What problems need to be solved?
    First, the experience of Factory 53 cannot be promoted well if only the trade union does it. It must be unified and specifically led by the provincial and municipal Party committees and the Party committees of industrial and mining enterprises, organize forces, and give play to the role of various organizations within the enterprise. The experience of Factory 53 can be said to be the experience of implementing the resolution of the Northeast Bureau on the Party's leadership over state-owned enterprises. From the perspective of grassroots leadership, the experience of Factory 53 is that "it has initially mastered the leadership art of modern enterprises, established a normal order of grassroots work, achieved remarkable achievements in both economic work and political work, and accumulated a relatively complete set of experiences." (December 28, 1952, People's Daily editorial) This shows that the experience of Factory 53 is a complete and comprehensive experience of an enterprise, including the specific work experience of every department of the enterprise, including the administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and Party committee. But if these departments do not cooperate closely and unify their steps, but promote them in isolation, they will not be promoted well in any way. Moreover, this method of promotion directly violates the basic spirit of the experience of Factory 53. We suggest that the key pilot working groups for promoting the experience of Factory 53 at the provincial and municipal levels should be directly led by the provincial and municipal Party committees or the industrial departments of the provincial and municipal Party committees, and organize unified forces, absorbing the participation of the administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and other relevant parties. The decision plan for promoting the experience of Factory 53 in the city should be uniformly issued by the municipal Party committee, and departments such as the trade union can attach specific plans under the overall plan, so that the trade union can play an active and due role in promoting the experience of Factory 53. In order to promote the experience of Factory 53 more widely, it is necessary to train grassroots cadres and conduct inspections and supervision of the promotion work. These tasks should also be planned and carried out by the municipal Party committee in a unified manner. Only in this way can the trade union and other departments, under the unified leadership of the Party, conscientiously do a good job in studying and promoting the experience of Factory 53.
    Second, proceed from reality, gradually improve in the promotion process, and make it perfect. The specific requirements of "proceeding from reality" are: 1. After generally studying the documents of the experience of Factory 53, we must compare and check the work of our unit, affirm the correct aspects, continue to adhere to them and promote them; find out the key problems that need to be improved, and learn from Factory 53's experience in solving these problems. This can dispel the excuse of "distant water cannot quench near thirst." 2. Combine with the current central movement and learn from Factory 53's experience in doing a good job in the current central movement (such as discussing plans, signing contracts, etc.). This can dispel the excuse of "the central work is very busy, and there is no time to promote it." If we ignore the original work foundation, ignore the current central work, and promote it out of reality, the result will inevitably be failure; the experience of Factory 53 will not be promoted, and the central movement will not be done well. The experience of Factory 53 is a relatively complete set of experiences. We should ask for comprehensive and systematic learning, not fragmented and piecemeal learning, or hold a passive attitude of "learning is better than not learning." But it must be achieved step by step in the learning process to be comprehensive, systematic, and perfect. In addition to gradually improving the ideological understanding of the experience of Factory 53, we must also carry out extremely important and meticulous organizational construction work. Therefore, we must pay attention to preventing impetuous and hasty emotions and practices.
    Third, starting from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, trade unions at all levels should earnestly implement the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on promoting the experience of Factory 53 in trade union work with an active, proactive, and more responsible spirit under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels. It is wrong to wait passively and hold a complaining attitude. At present, trade unions should focus on training grassroots cadres with the experience of Factory 53 in trade union work as the main content, including organizing cadres of the trade union leadership organs to seriously study the experience of Factory 53 in trade union work and other relevant documents, and formulating a good promotion plan; immediately participate in unified key pilot work. In the promotion, we must promptly summarize the situation, summarize the experience, put forward suggestions, and report to the Party committee regularly, relying on the unified leadership of the Party committee to continuously deepen and advance the promotion of the experience of Factory 53. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the general trade unions of various provinces and cities must designate special institutions to be responsible for studying and guiding the promotion of the experience of Factory 53 in trade union work. In our opinion, it is more appropriate to have the office of the general trade union as the main body, organizing the forces of the relevant departments to undertake this work. In the past, it was only done by the organizational department of the trade union, which is not enough.

    进一步推广五三工厂的经验
    东北总工会
    我们最近在沈阳、抚顺、阜新、鞍山等地的厂矿中了解了一些推广五三工厂经验的情况。这几个市的党委对推广五三工厂经验，是重视的。在许多重要的会议上与文件上都再三强调五三工厂的经验。抚顺、阜新两市市委还组织了工作组进行重点试验工作，并取得了成绩。凡是认真学习和推广过的地方，都有些收获，并已体会到“五三工厂经验真解决问题”。如一二一厂一车间的领导干部比其他车间都“新”，但由于他们经常认真地学习和运用五三工厂的经验，使该车间的工作比其他车间都好。别的认真学习的单位也使得企业的党、行政、工会、青年团思想步调比较一致了，政治思想工作加强了。不过，总的看来，这几个市推广五三工厂经验的工作，还没有普遍开展。这几个市的工会也没有认真地积极地进行这一工作。目前，这一工作的状况，大体是这样的：有一般号召，但缺少具体指导；党委宣传部门抓的紧，因此在宣传方面学到的就多一些，但组织建设方面就学的很少；片断零碎地学到一些经验，但对五三工厂经验的全面系统地学习很差。此外，还有形式摹仿，机械搬用，而不注意学习其基本的精神与实质的偏差。
    去年十二月，全国工会基层工作会议以及中华全国总工会发布“推广五三工厂工会工作经验的决定”之后，已引起各市工会领导方面的重视，目前已经开始组织市总工会机关干部学习五三工厂经验
    （有的已学完），制订在全市学习和推广五三工厂工会工作经验的计划；有的并已组织工作组，在党委统一领导下，开始进行重点试办工作。
    过去一个时期，这几个市有几个厂矿——沈阳的冶炼厂、阜新的平安钻探队、抚顺的胜利矿露天矿的两个坑口、鞍山的电修厂、制钢厂等，在学习和推广五三工厂经验上，获得了一些显著的成效并取得一些经验。
    第一、解决思想问题。这几个厂开始推广五三工厂经验时，都碰到了这样的思想障碍：“五三工厂经验是上级总结的，我们这里工作也不错，月月完成并超过任务，也有好经验，就是没人来总结。”
    （东北有些工厂，存在这种盲目自满情绪较多）或者是强调客观条件：“五三工厂经验是好，可是不能解决我这里的问题。”等到稍微知道了一些五三工厂经验的丰富内容时，就又表现保守畏难、缺乏信心：“五三工厂经验是好几年积累起来的，太深、太多、难学。”在开始学习的时候，由于没有很好地了解五三工厂经验的基本内容与基本精神，所以产生了这些思想。解决这些思想问题的有效办法，是在党的统一领导下，组织干部认真学习有关五三工厂经验的介绍文件，并根据“东北局关于党对国营企业领导的决议”，加以对照和检查。这样，就会使干部发觉五三工厂的经验是具体地贯彻了上述的决议，而本单位在这方面做的还差得很远；就很自然地产生应该向五三工厂好好学习的要求。如沈阳冶炼厂、胜利矿西井三区、六七一厂等学习成绩较好的单位，都是经过这样的过程。学习一定要订出计划，给以较多的时间（一般的每天有一小时），开始以组织脱离生产的干部进行学习为主。经过学习文件，把基本的思想观点弄明确了，就能够为推广五三工厂的许多具体经验准备好思想基础。如在党的领导下，开展批评与自我批评，保证思想步调的一致，发挥企业各个组织的作用；加强政治思想领导，使政治工作与经济工作相结合；以生产为中心，搞好生产、生活、教育三位一体的工作等。不经过学习或草率地学习五三工厂经验的文件，单凭热情急忙就去推广，或者不是自觉的而是以应付的态度去推广，证明是不行的。如抚顺老虎台矿工会领导干部以为到五三工厂参观过，回来只交代了一下，并未认真学习和检查工作，就去推广，结果失败了。
    第二、解决“从那里学起”的问题。几个学习成功的单位的经验证明，从解决当前存在的实际问题入手，即学习与运用五三工厂的经验来解决本厂矿当前存在的带关键性的实际问题，这是最好的“学习入门”。去年比较普遍的是在推广先进经验的工作中运用了五三工厂的思想调查、思想对照，启发群众自觉，用先进带动落后的经验。因此，使先进经验得到推广，保证了增产节约任务的完成。由于学之有效，后来，大家在许多工作中都注意运用思想调查、典型示范等方法。如今年一月，冶炼厂铅电解车间就是学习和具体运用了五三工厂经验，很成功地发动了群众进行讨论国家生产计划的工作。这样，使得基层干部原来不深入群众，只一般号召的工作作风有了很大的改进。也有的单位（如阜新钻探队）则是学习与运用五三工厂经验，先解决了党政工团关系不协调的思想问题。“从实际出发”学起，就能够解决实际问题，不仅可以避免形式主义机械摹仿的偏向，并且可以逐渐提高干部学习五三工厂经验的兴趣和信心。在这个基础上，前进一步，以达到全面和系统地学习，就不是很困难的了。
    第三、解决“坚持下去”的问题。怎么把学习五三工厂经验的成效巩固下来？经验是：必须运用群众中的积极分子，发挥企业各个组织的组织作用。对五三工厂经验的学习，由干部推广到积极分子中去，这还是一个很重要的组织建设工作。这几个单位比较好的做法与成绩，是建立与健全党的宣传网以及工会的文教委员会的组织，使政治思想教育工作和生产鼓动工作经常化；建立碰头会、业余时间合理分配等，使统一思想步调有了保障；建立干部每天学习一小时及下车间到职工宿舍串门等制度，使密切联系群众的工作作风经常保持……。虽然，做到这种程度的单位还不多，就是做了的也做得不完全；但是，必须这样做，已是无可怀疑的一条重要经验。
    第四、解决推广工作的领导问题。几个学习得好的单位（特别是重点试验的单位），都是由党委统一领导，组织企业内的党、行政、工会、青年团各方面的力量一起搞的。有的单位的重点试验工作组虽然还只是一个部门的（如党委宣传部）力量，但到重点试验的地方去，都是必然地把该地的党政工团的力量都组织起来统一进行（如抚顺胜利矿西井三区）。这样做是完全必要的，因为这样做的本身即体现出五三工厂经验的极重要的一条：从领导上解决统一思想、统一步调的问题。相反地，有些单位（如沈阳机械一厂）没有这样做，就叫下边（车间）学习五三工厂经验，结果上面不统一，给下面造成很多困难。有的干部说：“领导上还没学好呢，我们怎么能学好？”如抚顺制钢厂是由青年团来组织学习；电工十厂是由工会文教部组织学习，都没取得党委的统一领导和支持，结果推广不了。
    怎样进一步学习和推广五三工厂经验呢？要解决什么问题呢？
    第一、推广五三工厂的经验，如果只是工会去做是做不好的，必须由省市党委及工矿企业的党委统一地具体地加以领导，组织力量，发挥企业内各个组织的作用。五三工厂的经验可以说是贯彻东北局关于党对国营企业领导的决议的经验。就基层的领导方面说，五三工厂经验是“初步掌握了现代化企业的领导艺术，建立了基层工作的正常秩序，在经济工作与政治工作方面都获得了卓著的成绩，并积累了一套比较完备的经验”。（一九五二年十二月二十八日人民日报社论）这说明五三工厂经验是一个企业的完整的全面的经验，包含着企业的行政、工会、青年团以及党委的每一个部门的具体的工作经验。但是这些部门如果不是密切配合，统一步调，而是各自孤立地去推广，无论如何是推广不好的。而且，这种推广的方法，也直接违反了五三工厂经验的基本精神。我们建议：省市一级的推广五三工厂经验的重点试验工作组，最好由省市委或省市委工业部直接领导，统一组织力量，吸收行政、工会、青年团以及其他有关方面参加。全市推广五三工厂经验的决定计划要由市委统一发布，工会等部门可在总的规划下附发具体计划，以便工会在推广五三工厂经验中，起到积极应有的作用。为了比较广泛地推广五三工厂经验，必须作的训练基层干部以及对推广工作进行检查督促等工作，这些工作也要由市委统一筹划进行。只有这样才能使工会等部门在党的统一领导下，切实地搞好学习与推广五三工厂经验的工作。
    第二、从实际出发，在推广过程中逐步提高，使之臻于完善。“从实际出发”的具体要求是：一、一般地学习了五三工厂经验的文件后，必须对照检查本单位的工作，肯定正确的一方面，继续坚持并予以发扬；找出即须改进的关键性问题，学习五三工厂如何解决这些问题的经验。这就可以打消“远水不解近渴”的借口。二、与当前中心运动结合，学习五三工厂如何搞好目前中心运动（如讨论计划、签订合同等）的经验。这就可以打消“中心工作很忙，没有时间推广”的借口。如果不管原来的工作基础，不管当前的中心工作，脱离实际地去推广，结果必然失败；五三工厂经验既推不广，中心运动也搞不好。五三工厂经验是一套比较完备的经验，我们应该要求全面系统的学，而不是零碎片断的学，或是抱“学比不学好”的消极态度。但是必须是在学习过程中一步一步地达到全面、系统和完善。这里除开逐渐提高对五三工厂经验的思想认识以外，还须进行极重要的细致的组织建设工作。因此，要注意防止急躁草率的情绪和做法。
    第三、从东北总工会起，各级工会应该以积极主动、多负责任的精神，在各级党委统一领导下，认真执行全国总工会关于推广五三工厂工会工作的经验的决定。消极等待和持埋怨的态度是不对的。工会目前应该着重以五三工厂工会工作经验为主要内容来训练基层干部，包括组织工会领导机关的干部认真学习五三工厂工会工作经验和其他有关文件，订好推广的计划；立即参加统一的重点试验工作。推广中要及时综合情况，总结经验，提出建议，经常向党委报告，依靠党委统一领导，使五三工厂经验的推广工作不断深入、前进。东北总工会及各省市总工会必须指定专门机构负责研究与指导推广五三工厂工会工作经验的工作。我们的意见，是以总工会的办公室为主，组织有关各部的力量担任这个工作比较合适，过去只由工会的组织部门来搞，是不够的。
