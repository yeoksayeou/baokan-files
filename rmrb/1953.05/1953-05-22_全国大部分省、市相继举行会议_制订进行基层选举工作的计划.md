Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Most provinces and municipalities across the country have recently held meetings one after another, and, in accordance with the spirit of the election law and in light of local conditions, have specifically studied and formulated plans for carrying out grassroots election work.

    After the establishment of the election committees in some provinces and cities, meetings have been held to discuss the general election. The Shandong Provincial Election Committee held its first meeting on the 12th to discuss and approve the implementation plan for grassroots election work. The meeting decided that the election work of approximately 16,800 grassroots election units in the province will be completed in two batches before October; the election work at the county and city levels throughout the province will be completed in November. The current central task of the Provincial Election Committee is to conduct pilot projects of typical cases to create experience; at the same time, it is required that 7,000 cadres be trained before mid-June to guide the first batch of grassroots election work. Before mid-May, the election committees of various provinces and cities in Northeast China held meetings to discuss and formulate plans and steps for conducting grassroots election work in various provinces and cities. Jilin Province and Liaoxi Province successively convened joint meetings of city and county election committee chairmen and civil affairs section chiefs in mid-April and mid-May to deploy grassroots election work. In addition, provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Hunan, Henan, and cities such as Beijing, Wuhan, and Chengdu have also convened meetings of election committees to deploy grassroots election work. Thirty-three counties and cities in Gansu Province have established election committees and have already started working. The Hunan Provincial Election Committee decided to allocate more than 80,000 cadres throughout the province to participate in grassroots election work. Each district in Chengdu is holding a meeting of propaganda representatives and a meeting of heads of district cultural centers to prepare for a wide-ranging general election propaganda campaign. The Jiangsu Provincial Election Committee convened a joint meeting of chairmen of election committees from all cities and counties in the province from May 4th to 11th. The meeting decided to conduct grassroots election work in two batches throughout the province in the four months from July to October. The meeting pointed out that when deploying grassroots election work, all localities must closely integrate it with production.

    In some provinces and cities, discussions and deployments related to general election work were conducted at people's representative conferences. The third second session of the Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles, with the discussion of the general election as the central topic, was held from May 11th to 13th. The meeting adopted a report on the draft plan for grassroots election work in Wuhan City and discussed the specific steps of grassroots election work, the number of representatives, and the method of taking care of production in the general election work. Chongqing held the fourth second session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles on the 5th, which determined the work steps for this year's grassroots election in Chongqing.

    Some provinces and cities have deployed grassroots election work at meetings of the People's Government Committee, the CPPCC, and joint meetings of the two. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Committee and the CPPCC held a meeting on the 12th, and at the same time established the Tianjin Municipal Election Committee, and determined the steps and plans for the general election work in Tianjin. Now the Tianjin Municipal Election Committee Office and the Population Survey Office have been established and have begun to work.
