Reader's Letters Summary

Should Stop the Chaotic Phenomenon of Recruiting Workers

Editor's Note: The following four letters, published in summary form, expose the chaotic phenomena of some enterprises and institutions privately poaching employed workers, recruiting workers and apprentices without going through labor departments or legal procedures, and privately poaching students from schools. This has resulted in workers leaving factories, affecting school teaching, and causing the blind influx of rural labor into cities. In the national large-scale construction work, the recruitment of employees by various enterprise departments will increase even more due to production needs. If the above-mentioned erroneous practices continue to occur, it will increase the difficulty in the unified allocation of labor and will be detrimental to the entire national production. Therefore, we suggest that the Central Labor Department take effective measures to stop this erroneous practice.

Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Textile New Factory Violates Labor Policy by Privately Poaching Employed Workers

Li Wenchao and Zhou Fuquan from the Shaanxi Provincial Public-Private Joint New Qin Company Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory write: The Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Textile New Factory, through worker Zhang Chengxiang (who used to work in our factory), privately poached our factory's old workmates to work in their factory. Our factory was formerly the Shenxin Company Fourth Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, and many of our workers are from the vicinity of Zhengzhou. Thus, in August and September of last year, eight of our factory's workers, including Zhao Mengxin, Saidecheng, and Zhang Deshan, asked for leave on various pretexts to go to Zhengzhou. After contacting the factory, they left our factory privately to work in Zhengzhou.

In order to solve this problem, our factory sent people through the introduction of the Henan Provincial People's Government to negotiate with the factory at the end of October last year. Initially, the factory only allowed Zhang Chengxiang to come forward to deal with the matter, saying that no workers from our factory had jumped to their factory to work. Later, our factory cadres found three people, including Saidecheng, and obtained conclusive evidence that these workers who had jumped factories were working at the Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Textile New Factory and had been promoted to directors, foremen, or masters. With the assistance of the Zhengzhou Municipal Labor Bureau, we negotiated with the factory again. Wang, the section chief of the factory's personnel section, only admitted to employing three people, including Saidecheng, and promised to let them return to our factory. However, after Saidecheng and others returned to our factory, they refused to work and resolutely demanded to go through the departure procedures. Despite repeated education by the responsible comrades of our factory and the promise to help them solve their difficulties, it was ultimately ineffective. After the three of them left one after another, they were recruited by the Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Textile New Factory again.

After this, these workers who jumped factories continued to write letters to poach our factory's old workers to work in Zhengzhou. Many old workers in our factory asked for leave on various pretexts to contact Zhengzhou. After returning, in addition to luring other workers to jump factories, they deliberately did not comply with labor discipline and arbitrarily asked for leave and were absent from work. This has caused great difficulties in our factory's production management, causing our factory to stop as many as ten machines every night due to insufficient technicians since November last year.

On February 6 this year, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry sent us two to Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Textile New Factory to negotiate. With the assistance of the Zhengzhou Municipal Labor Bureau, we held a meeting with Luo, the deputy director of the factory, to study and determine that the factory would be responsible for mobilization first, and then study solutions on February 9. However, the factory still did not handle this matter until the Labor Bureau inquired on April 10. The Labor Bureau then invited Zhang Zhiping, deputy director of the factory, to come to the meeting to study and decided to convene a meeting of workers who jumped factories the next day, with the Labor Bureau explaining the policies, the factory making a self-criticism mobilization report, and us responsible for solving the specific problems that the worker comrades might raise. However, when the meeting was held the next day, Deputy Director Zhang did not review the factory's erroneous practice of poaching employed workers. At that time, the workers raised many opinions and were unwilling to return to the factory. After obtaining the factory's consent, we decided to adopt an individual interview approach for mobilization. However, the factory did not assist us in our individual mobilization work, and we couldn't even find the workers.

We hope that the Henan Provincial Labor Department will assist the Zhengzhou Municipal Labor Bureau in correcting the factory's departmentalism and violations of labor laws.

Beijing Construction Company and Other Units Should Not Privately Poach Employed Workers in Jinan City

Letter from the Shandong Provincial People's Government Labor Bureau: Yang Xingfu, an employee of the Beijing Construction Company, went to Jinan City in February this year and poached Liang Tongfu, a technical worker from the private Shanda Factory, and went to Beijing to work with him. After Liang Tongfu arrived in Beijing, he wrote a letter to the grassroots trade union of the Shanda Factory, saying that he was working at the Beijing Construction Company and requested to transfer his trade union membership. After this letter arrived at the factory, it caused ideological fluctuations among many workers in the factory, and they prepared to jump factories one after another. Among them, nine technical workers, including Liang Limin, have submitted requests for resignation and have not come to work for six days. This has hindered the timely completion of an installation project recently contracted by the Shanda Factory.

In addition, Liu Zhaoshun, a lathe technician from the Jinan City Private Linxiang Industrial Cooperative, resigned in February this year because a technical worker from a certain department stationed in Beijing poached him to work in that department. The trade union tried to dissuade him, but it was ineffective.

The behavior of the Beijing Construction Company and other units in privately poaching employed technical workers from private factories has affected the production morale of some employed workers in private factories in Jinan City. It is hoped that the above two units will be responsible for sending the privately poached workers back to their original factories in order to recover the losses.

Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau First Power Plant Randomly Posts Notices to Recruit Apprentices, Causing Bad Consequences

Reader Bei Da Ken writes: The First Power Plant of the First Line Work Area of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, decided to recruit some apprentices due to production needs. However, the factory's personnel department did not coordinate with the Huangshi Municipal Labor Bureau and decided to openly recruit in the city without authorization. The factory recruited very few apprentices, but they posted notices all over the city. Although the notice stated that employed workers and students in school would not be accepted, the factory relaxed the application conditions in an informal way because the factory handled the registration procedures carelessly. As a result, there were hundreds of young students and young farmers from the city and from Qichun, Daye, Yangxin, Xishui, Huanggang and other places who applied. The factory only admitted a very small number of them, causing many young students and young farmers from other places to wander in the city without a way to solve their problems. At the same time, it also affected school teaching and agricultural production. The factory's practice of violating labor policies and recruiting apprentices without authorization is very inappropriate.

The Third Survey and Design Team of the Ministry of Railways Should Not Recruit Students in School to Participate in Work

Letter from the Third District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jimo County, Shandong Province: The Third Survey and Design Team of the Central Ministry of Railways privately poached students in school in Zhangjiabu Village, Third District, Jimo County, to participate in work, which affected the local school's teaching work. In early March, two cadres from a team of the team lived in the home of Zhou Naizhi, a sixth-grade student at Zhangjiabu Elementary School. They often mobilized Zhou Naizhi to leave school and participate in railway work. Zhou Naizhi promoted this to her classmates at school, causing six students in the school to be uneasy about studying and wanting to go to the Third Survey and Design Team to work. These students are all very young, and their parents and the school have educated them to study with peace of mind, but the effect is not great. On the evening of March 30, student Chen Fangmei quarreled with her father for half the night, and the next morning, she carried her bedding and went with Zhou Naizhi to report to the team headquarters of the Third Survey and Design Team stationed in Xiagezhuang. As a result, both students were hired. This incident caused ideological fluctuations among the students in the school and affected the normal progress of teaching work. The principal of Zhangjiabu Elementary School reflected the situation to the district, and the district office wrote to the team to criticize the team for not accepting students in school. However, the team ignored it and recruited Song Zhongmeng, a sixth-grade student at Zhangjiabu Elementary School, on April 9. The impact has spread to other villages. Students at Wagaozhuang Elementary School also want to participate in railway work and are not at ease in their studies, which has caused chaos in the school order.

Consigning Units Should Seriously Prepare and Effectively Implement Railway Transportation Plans

Letter from Chen Rixuan, Zhangjiakou Station: Some consigning units lack understanding of railway planned transportation and often do not consign according to the plan, which causes serious difficulties for railway freight work. Zhangjiakou Station often encounters this situation. For example, the first station of the Zhangjiakou Branch of the Hebei Provincial United Transportation Company had a total of 260 railcars for the first quarter, but only 30 percent of the railcars were planned in advance. However, these planned railcars actually accounted for only 62 percent of the quarterly plan. Of the 30 cars of livestock planned for transportation in February, 27 cars were not completed; the original plan was to transport ten cars of livestock to Tianjin in March, but not a single car was consigned. In order to transport the 18 cars of livestock that were not planned, the company arbitrarily changed the monthly plan. According to statistics, the number of cars that were changed without authorization in January this year accounted for 89 percent of the planned cars. The current situation has not changed. Because cargo owners do not accurately submit railcar plans to the railway, the railway cannot well grasp the situation of cargo sources and cargo flow, which may cause the phenomenon of railcars being busy at times and railcars being wasted at other times, and may even cause serious chaos in railway transportation. It is recommended that all consigning units seriously prepare and effectively implement transportation plans, resolutely overcome the convenient concept of "loading whenever there is a car"; transportation workers should strengthen the publicity of the importance of planned transportation to cargo owners and actively help cargo owners solve their difficulties.

Jingdezhen Model Porcelain Factory and Other Units Have Not Picked Up Goods for a Long Time After Ordering Machines

Letter from Yang Junhui: The Jingdezhen Model Porcelain Factory in Jiangxi Province ordered a total of 203 ceramic machines, including ball mills, electric motors, brick rolling machines, and clay filtering machines, from the Tangshan Pottery Machine Factory in Hebei Province in January 1952, with a total value of 2.5015 billion yuan; the contract stipulated that the goods should be picked up on August 30 of the same year. However, until now, the Jingdezhen Model Porcelain Factory has not picked up a single item, so that the Tangshan Pottery Machine Factory has spent nearly 200 million yuan on machine storage fees alone. The Tangshan Pottery Machine Factory has sent official letters to the Jingdezhen Model Porcelain Factory, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry, and the Jiangxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee several times to urge them to pick up the goods, but there has been no follow-up. In addition, the 91 ceramic machines (total value of 980.4 million yuan) ordered by the Hunan Liling Enterprise Company from the Tangshan Pottery Machine Factory have also been overdue for more than ten months without being picked up. The behavior of the Jingdezhen Model Porcelain Factory and the Liling Enterprise Company in violating the contract seriously hinders the production of the Tangshan Pottery Machine Factory. It is hoped that the industrial departments of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces will promptly urge them to pick up the machines.

Qin Tianxiang, Former Manager of Jingdezhen Bao Porcelain Company, Should Not Interfere with Wang Guanyi's Freedom of Marriage

Letter from reader Cheng Zhengtang: Qin Tianxiang, the former manager of the Jingdezhen City Bao Porcelain Company in Jiangxi Province (later transferred to manager of the Jingdezhen People's Insurance Company), as a Communist Party member, abused his power to interfere with the freedom of marriage of cadres and persecuted female cadre Wang Guanyi. Wang Guanyi, 17 years old, was betrothed to Fang Mingquan, a cadre of the Bao Porcelain Company, through her mother's arrangement in June last year. Qin Tianxiang often talked to Wang Guanyi, telling her to "marry Fang Mingquan." On November 18 last year, Wang Guanyi expressed her rejection of Qin Tianxiang's opinion. Qin Tianxiang slammed the table and scolded, "You were introduced by me, you are in the palm of my hand; I will expel you and lock you up!" When this threat failed, Qin Tianxiang stipulated that employees of the company were not allowed to approach Wang Guanyi. Later, although Qin Tianxiang had been transferred to manager of the People's Insurance Company, he still went to the Bao Porcelain Company without authorization, declaring that he would "expel Wang Guanyi." Cao Zhifa, the new manager, expressed his support for Wang Guanyi, and Qin Tianxiang scolded Cao Zhifa. In the face of unbearable suffering, Wang Guanyi filed a complaint with the Jingdezhen Municipal People's Court on January 5 this year, but it was not resolved. Wang Guanyi therefore fell ill with worry and vomited a lot of blood. In her critical condition, she still said: "I'm afraid, I'm afraid of Manager Qin." A young and lively girl was persecuted to this point by Qin Tianxiang, which is really intolerable. I ask the People's Government to quickly investigate and deal with this incident.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    应该制止招聘工人中的混乱现象
    编者按：下面摘要发表的四件来信，揭发了某些企业单位不通过劳动部门和不经过合法手续，私拉在业工人，擅自招收工人和学徒并私拉在校学生，以致造成职工跳厂，影响学校教学和农村劳动力盲目流入城市等的混乱现象。在国家大规模建设工作中，各地企业部门由于生产需要，招聘职工的将更增加，上述错误做法如继续发生，将会增加劳动力统一调配中的困难，对整个国家生产是不利的。因此，我们建议中央劳动部，采取有效办法制止这种错误做法。
    郑州国营棉纺新厂违反劳动政策私拉在业工人
    陕西省公私合营新秦公司纺织印染厂李文超、周福全来信：郑州国营棉纺新厂通过该厂工人张成祥
    （过去曾在我厂工作）私拉我厂老工友到该厂工作。我厂原系申新公司第四纺织印染厂，有不少工人是郑州附近的人。于是，去年八、九月间，即有我厂工人赵孟新、赛德成、张德山等八人，借故请假到郑州，和该厂取得联系后，就私自离厂到郑州工作。
    我厂为了解决这个问题，去年十月底就派人经河南省人民政府介绍和该厂洽商。起初该厂只让张成祥出面应付，说是我厂并无工人跳到该厂工作。后来我厂干部找到了赛德成等三人，掌握了这些跳厂工人在郑州国营棉纺新厂工作并被提拔为主任、领班或师傅的确实证据后，又经郑州市劳动局协助，再到该厂商谈。该厂人事科王科长只承认收用了赛德成等三人，答应让他们返回我厂。但赛德成等返我厂后，竟拒绝工作，并坚决要求办理离厂手续。虽经我厂负责同志多次教育，并答应帮助他们解决困难，但终归无效。他们三人相继离去后，又被郑州国营棉纺新厂收用了。
    在这以后，这些跳厂工人又不断写信拉我厂老工人到郑州去工作。我厂不少老工人借故请假到郑州联系，回来后除拉拢其他工人跳厂外，并故意不遵守劳动纪律，任意请假、旷工。这已经造成我厂生产管理上的很大困难，使我厂从去年十一月至今，因技工不足而每晚停车十台之多。
    今年二月六日，陕西省工业厅就派我们两人到郑州国营棉纺新厂交涉。在郑州市劳动局协助下，我们与该厂罗副厂长开会研究，确定先由该厂负责动员，二月九日再研究解决办法。但直到四月十日劳动局催询时，该厂仍未办理此事。劳动局又请该厂张治平副厂长前来开会研究，决定第二天召集跳厂工人开会，由劳动局讲政策，该厂作检讨性动员报告，我们负责解决工人同志可能提出的具体问题。可是第二天开会时，张副厂长并不检讨该厂拉在业工人的错误做法，当时工人就提出很多意见，不愿返厂。我们取得该厂同意后，决定采用个别谈话方式进行动员。但该厂对我们个别动员工作不予协助，我们连工人都找不到。
    我们希望河南省劳动部门协助郑州市劳动局纠正该厂这种本位主义和违反劳动法令的行为。
    北京市建筑公司等单位不应到济南市私拉在业工人
    山东省人民政府劳动局来信：北京市建筑公司职工杨兴福今年二月间到济南市，把私营山大工厂技术工人梁同福拉走，一同前往北京工作。梁同福到北京后给山大工厂基层工会来信，说他已在北京市建筑公司工作，要求办理工会会籍的转移手续。这封信到厂后，使该厂不少工人思想波动，纷纷准备跳厂。其中梁立民等九个技术工人已提出辞职的要求，并已六天不来上班。这已妨碍了山大工厂最近承包的某安装工程的如期完成。
    此外，济南市私营林祥工业社车床技工刘肇顺在今年二月间因驻北京市某部的技术工人拉他到该部去工作，就提出辞职，经工会劝阻无效。
    北京市建筑公司等单位这种私拉私营工厂在职技术工人的行为，已经影响了济南市部分私营工厂在业工人的生产情绪。希望以上两单位负责将私自拉走的工人，送回原厂，以挽回损失。
    武汉冶电业局第一发电厂乱贴布告招收学徒造成恶果
    读者北大垦来信：湖北黄石市武汉冶电业局第一线路工区第一发电厂因生产需要，决定招收一些学徒。但该厂人事部门并没有和黄石市劳动局联系好，就擅自决定在市内公开招考。该厂招收学徒的名额很少，但他们却在全市大贴布告。布告上虽注明在业职工和在校学生不收；但是因为该厂办理报名手续时粗枝大叶，无形中放宽了报考条件。结果，报名者有该市和来自蕲春、大冶、阳新、浠水、黄冈等地的青年学生和青年农民共数百人之多。该厂只录取了很少几个，致使很多来自外地的青年学生和青年农民流落该市没有办法，同时也影响了学校教学和农业生产。该厂这种违反劳动政策、擅自招考学徒的做法，是很不应该的。
    铁道部第三勘察设计总队不应招收在校学生参加工作
    中共山东省即墨县第三区委员会来信：中央铁道部第三勘察设计总队在即墨县三区章加埠村私拉在校学生参加工作，影响当地学校的教学工作。三月上旬，该队某小组有两个干部借住在章加埠完全小学六年级学生周乃芝的家里，他们经常动员周乃芝离开学校，参加铁路工作。周乃芝就在学校中向同学宣传，以致校内先后有六名学生不安心学习，要到第三勘察设计总队去工作。这些学生年纪都很轻，家长和校方都教育他们要安心学习，但是效果不大。学生陈方美在三月三十日晚上和父亲吵了半夜，次日早晨就背起铺盖和周乃芝一起到驻在夏格庄的第三勘察设计总队队部报到。结果这两个学生都被录用了。这件事引起该校学生思想波动，影响教学工作的正常进行。章加埠完全小学校长把情况反映到区里，区公所写信与该队联系，批评该队不应收留在校学生。但是该队并不理睬，在四月九日又收留了章加埠完全小学六年级学生宋中孟。影响已经扩及到外村了，瓦戈庄完全小学也有学生要参加铁路工作，不安心学习，使学校秩序发生混乱。
    托运单位应该认真编制并切实执行铁路运输计划
    张家口车站陈日轩来信：某些托运单位对铁路计划运输缺乏认识，往往不按计划托运，以致给铁路货运工作造成严重困难。张家口车站经常遇到这种情况。如河北省联运公司张家口分公司第一站，第一季度总托运车数为二百六十个车皮，但只有百分之三十的车皮是预先提出计划的。而这些提出计划的车皮，实际上只占季度计划的百分之六十二。二月份计划要运的三十车牲畜，有二十七车未完成；三月份原计划运到天津十车牲畜，结果一车都未托运。该公司为了把没有作在计划内的十八车牲畜运送出去，竟任意变更月间计划。据统计，今年一月份这种擅自变更计划的车数已占有计划车的百分之八十九。目前情况并未改变。由于货主不是准确地向铁路上提出要车计划，铁路便不能很好地掌握货源和货流的情况，因而可能造成时而车皮繁忙，时而车皮浪费的现象，甚至会造成铁路运输中的严重混乱。建议各托运单位认真编制并切实执行运输计划，坚决克服“有车就装”的省事观念；运输工作者应加强向货主宣传计划运输的重要性，主动帮助货主解决困难。
    景德镇示范磁厂等单位订购机器后长期不提货
    扬俊辉来信：江西省景德镇示范磁厂在一九五二年一月向河北省唐山窑业机器厂订购球磨机、电动机、轧砖机和滤泥机等陶磁机器共二百零三台，总值二十五亿零一百五十万元；合同规定同年八月三十日提货。但直到现在，景德镇示范磁厂一件货也没有提取，以致唐山窑业机器厂光机器保管费一项就化了将近两亿元。唐山窑业机器厂曾经几次给景德镇示范磁厂、江西省工业厅和江西省财经委员会去过公函，催促他们提货，但始终没有下文。此外，湖南醴陵企业公司向唐山窑业机器厂订购的九十一台陶磁机器（总值九亿八千零四十万元），现在也过期十个多月没提走。景德镇示范磁厂、醴陵企业公司这种破坏合同的行为，严重地妨碍唐山窑业机器厂的生产。希望江西、湖南两省工业厅迅速督促他们把机器提去。
    景德镇包瓷公司前经理秦天祥不该干涉汪观益的婚姻自由
    读者程正棠来信：江西省景德镇市包瓷公司前经理秦天祥（后调任景德镇人民保险公司经理），身为共产党员，竟滥用职权干涉干部婚姻自由，迫害女干部汪观益。汪观益年十七岁，于去年六月被她母亲包办和包瓷公司干部方明权订婚。秦天祥经常找汪观益谈话，叫她“和方明权结婚”。去年十一月十八日，汪观益表示拒绝秦天祥的意见，秦天祥拍桌大骂：“你是我介绍来的，是我的手掌心；我要开除你，把你关起来！”这样威胁不成，秦天祥又规定，不准公司职工和汪观益接近。以后，秦天祥虽已调任人民保险公司经理，还擅自到包瓷公司声言要“开除汪观益”。新任经理曹志发表示支持汪观益，秦天祥便大骂曹志发。汪观益在忍无可忍的情况下于今年一月五日向景德镇市人民法院控告，但也没有得到解决。汪观益因而忧愁成疾，大量吐血。在病危中，她还说：“我怕，我怕秦经理。”一个年青活泼的女孩子，被秦天祥迫害到这个地步，实在令人不能容忍。我要求人民政府迅速检查处理这一事件。
