Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Supplementary Instructions on the Work of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Month" and other relevant documents, various regions have, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions, overcome the chaotic phenomena of random struggles and punishments in the implementation of the Marriage Law. They have shifted their main energy to conducting propaganda and education work on the Marriage Law, which has played a significant role in changing the feudal ideology and consciousness of the masses. Many marital and family disputes have begun to be resolved through realistic and correct mediation based on the principles of the Marriage Law, strengthening internal unity and preparing more favorable conditions for the development of production. However, many regions have deviated in the implementation of these instructions, causing serious adverse consequences. After the People's Daily published the suicide case of Lin Yuchun, a child bride in Yingshang Township, Longxi County, Fujian Province, on March 16th, other counties in Fujian Province, Nanjing, Shanghai, Songjiang Province and Benxi City in the Northeast, several counties in Sichuan Province in the Southwest, several counties in Shaanxi Province in the Northwest, and Inner Mongolia in North China... all had incidents of women committing suicide or being killed.

The direct causes of these incidents, in addition to a small number of cadres adopting an irresponsible attitude towards possible cases of women's suicide or being killed, and delaying dealing with divorce requests from women who could not bear the abuse, leading to suicide and murder, are mainly due to many cadres blindly advising reconciliation without principle in handling marital disputes, conducting compulsory and endless mediation, causing some women who cannot bear domestic abuse and have poor relationships with their husbands to fall into despair, and thus commit suicide or be killed. In Quanjiabaozi Village, Jianchang District, Benxi City, a couple had a very bad relationship. The woman, due to being abused, firmly requested a divorce from the District People's Government. The cadres of the District People's Government compulsively and rigidly advised reconciliation, refusing to allow the divorce. The woman was helpless and committed suicide by hanging herself on March 21st. The man also committed suicide out of fear of punishment, but was rescued. Li Chunbi, a woman from Huangjia Township, Dazhu County, Sichuan Province, had consistently been abused by her husband. She filed for divorce after liberation, but the village cadres did not allow it. This time, during the movement, she filed for divorce again with great hope, but it was still only mediation. Her husband knew she wanted a divorce and beat her severely again, forcing her to a dead end. She jumped into the river with her child, but was fortunately rescued. In Lujiazhuang, Chenggu County, Shaanxi, a couple had a terrible relationship. The husband beat his wife in nineteen places, and later locked her up, placing a knife and rope to threaten her to commit suicide. The wife escaped and requested a divorce, but the cadres told her to "go back and live a good life." This kind of forced mediation is quite common, even in cases where child brides and their husband's families both voluntarily want to terminate the marriage, the cadres still insist on preventing it and enforcing reconciliation, leading to women being forced to commit suicide or be killed.

The root causes of the phenomenon of forced mediation in terms of understanding are: first, there is a deviation in the understanding of "family harmony and unity for production," that is, isolating the general goal of "harmony and unity" from the fundamental principles of the Marriage Law, namely the principles of "freedom of marriage" and "equality of rights between men and women." They do not understand that without this principle, there can be no true harmony. The Central Committee's supplementary instructions emphasized that "undemocratic and disharmonious families should improve the relationship between husband and wife, and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, to make them democratic and harmonious families." The "democratic and harmonious" mentioned here is based on equality between men and women and freedom of marriage. To seek so-called "harmony" without this foundation is, in effect, to maintain the barbaric and backward feudal marriage system, abolish the Marriage Law, and cancel the work of implementing the Marriage Law. The result will inevitably be the continuous occurrence of women's suicide and murder, as in the past. Some cadres in Baoji and other counties in Shaanxi Province only talked about family harmony and respecting mothers-in-law when publicizing the Marriage Law, without talking about equality between men and women and opposing beatings and abuse of women. They did not dare to fully explain the freedom of marriage, nor did they dare to link it with reality to expose the harm of the feudal marriage system, resulting in the complete disappointment of abused women. After an abused woman in Baoji County listened to this kind of report from the work team, she committed suicide when she returned home.

This is a painful lesson.

Second, directly related to the above problem is the misunderstanding of the principle of "not advocating divorce," that is, misunderstanding "not advocating divorce" as "opposing divorce" or "not allowing divorce." Some cadres in Qishan County, Shaanxi Province, said during the implementation of the Marriage Law movement: "For those who request a divorce, mediate, mediate, and mediate again." The implication is that only mediation is allowed, and divorce cannot be approved. The direct reaction among the broad masses was: "The government's policy has changed, and divorce is not allowed." Similar situations exist in other regions. These comrades do not understand that the Central Committee's instruction not to advocate divorce is to tell us that we should not proactively and meddlesomely instigate people to divorce, but should patiently conduct mediation to reconcile those couples who have the possibility of reconciliation. As for those "couples whose relationship is extremely bad and cannot continue to be maintained after mediation," the Central Committee instructed us to "grant a divorce." This provision is in accordance with Article 17 of the Marriage Law: "If both men and women voluntarily agree to a divorce, it shall be granted. If one party resolutely demands a divorce, and mediation by the district people's government and judicial organs is ineffective, a divorce shall also be granted." This provision is one of the most fundamental differences between our new democratic marriage system and the feudal marriage system. Without this, both parties in a bad relationship will be trapped in long-term suffering, affecting production, social order, and even leading to cases of loss of life. There have already been too many cases of loss of life due to rigidly restricting divorce, and it should not be repeated!

Third, there is a deviation and one-sidedness in the understanding of the "mass viewpoint" and "mass line." Some comrades say: The Central Committee requires the masses to consciously and voluntarily implement the Marriage Law and act in accordance with the Marriage Law; it requires us to win social sympathy and win the support of the masses. Now the masses can only accept "harmony and unity," but cannot accept freedom of marriage, especially freedom of divorce. If we want to talk about this kind of freedom and handle practical problems in this way, we will be divorced from the masses. As a result, many cadres do not dare to act according to the law and principles, and even do not dare to speak out. These comrades have not thought about the fact that it is precisely because the masses have feudal and backward ideas on marriage that we must carry out the movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law (and transform it into regular work after the movement and continue to carry it out), "systematically criticize old ideas, old systems, and old habits, and establish positions for new ideas, new systems, and new customs" (see the Central Committee's supplementary instructions). And many facts have proven that as long as we can explain the advantages and disadvantages with examples and reason, the vast majority of the masses, even the elderly, can completely accept the principles of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women, and can agree that we handle practical problems according to these principles. The problem is that we must eliminate the tailism ideology and patiently and vividly carry out propaganda to the masses. Does it mean that we cannot act according to the law if a small number of people firmly disagree? That is not the case either. Once the law is promulgated, it must be enforced; and the enforcement of the law is mandatory. While publicizing the Marriage Law, we should handle practical problems according to the Marriage Law, and continue to carry out propaganda in the process, explaining the reasons for handling it in this way or that way, and what benefits it will bring to the masses. This will make the handling also become propaganda for policies and laws. As long as our handling is in line with policies and laws, correct, reconciling those who can be reconciled, divorcing those who should be divorced, and clarifying the advantages and disadvantages, it will promote the awakening of those with backward ideas.

Fourth, some comrades seem to think that since the Central Committee has determined to "adhere to the policy of education" and "for the general masses of the people, the publicity of the Marriage Law should be limited," then the handling of practical problems can be relaxed or slightly relaxed. Some people even say: "There is nothing to do, just talk about it." Therefore, they either express indifference to the problems raised by the masses and refuse to take care of them, or forcibly reconcile them in a simple way, not allowing divorce, thinking that it does not matter if the problem is not solved, and they can save themselves from dealing with disputes over children and property in divorce, and save themselves from persuading some masses who oppose divorce. These comrades do not understand that although publicity should be limited for the general masses of the people, for the masses who have raised practical problems and asked us to help solve them, we must conscientiously help solve their problems in accordance with policies and laws. The Party and the People's Government will never allow staff members to not solve or not conscientiously solve the practical problems raised by the masses in accordance with policies and laws.

Liquidating and correcting the distortions, misunderstandings, and one-sided understanding of the Central Committee's instructions, and enabling all cadres to correctly and comprehensively understand the Central Committee's instructions, is the key to overcoming the phenomenon of forced mediation and preventing incidents of women's suicide and being killed. In the future regular work of continuing to publicize and implement the Marriage Law, the Party and government leading organs in various places should pay attention to educating cadres and fundamentally solving the above-mentioned ideological problems. At the same time, it is necessary to educate the cadres who are actually responsible for this work, so that they understand that the purpose of mediation work is to implement the Marriage Law and achieve family democracy and harmony on the basis of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women, rather than violating the Marriage Law to prevent divorce and maintain those marital relationships that cannot be maintained. The methods and attitudes of mediation should be to analyze in a realistic and truth-seeking manner in accordance with principles and the actual situation, distinguishing which can and should be reconciled, and which cannot and should not be reconciled, and then carry out different handling separately. Oppose unprincipled "mud-slinging" and being a vulgar "peacemaker." The power of mediation should be limited to mediation. Reconciliation can only be established if both parties truly agree to it after mediation; if one party insists on disagreeing, it should be submitted to the judicial organs for judgment. Mediators have no right to forcibly "reconcile," nor do they have the right to conduct so-called "re-mediation" indefinitely, which actually cancels the litigant's right to appeal.

In addition, it must be noted that some cadres make the mistake of forced mediation not only because of deviations in their understanding of the Central Committee's instructions, but also because feudal ideological consciousness is at play. The township head of Xuyang Township, Nanping County, Fujian Province, once clearly stated during the Marriage Law implementation movement: "I get a headache as soon as I see a divorce." This reflects the ideological situation of a considerable number of grassroots cadres. They not only dislike the trouble of divorce incidents, but also fundamentally cannot stand it. In Xuyang Township, there was a young couple who both firmly demanded a divorce because they originally loved someone else, but the cadres insisted on reconciling them and firmly refused to allow them to divorce. For cadres who handle marital disputes from the standpoint of the feudal marriage system, in addition to informing them of policies and laws, it is also necessary to conduct anti-feudal education.

Finally, it should be stated that we are not opposed to mediation or patient mediation, and we do not advocate "divorcing as soon as a complaint is filed." For those couples who truly have feelings for each other, and only request a divorce due to some reasons that are not insurmountable, but have the possibility of reconciliation, patient mediation and education should still be carried out to restore their reconciliation and unite for production. Many facts in various places have proven that this kind of education and mediation can be completely effective. However, we firmly oppose any forced and endless mediation, and oppose mediation that violates the Marriage Law based on feudal principles.

    纠正处理婚姻纠纷中的强制调解现象
    林韦  王青
    中共中央《关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示》及其他有关文件发布以后，各地依据指示的精神，克服了贯彻婚姻法中乱斗争、乱处罚等混乱现象，转而集中主要精力进行关于婚姻法的宣传教育工作，在改变群众的封建思想意识上起了巨大的作用。许多婚姻与家庭纠纷，经过实事求是的按照婚姻法原则进行正确的调解，开始得到解决，增强了人民内部的团结，为发展生产准备了更有利的条件。但是，也有不少地区在执行这一指示时发生了偏差，造成了严重的恶果。三月十六日本报发表福建省龙溪县营尚乡童养媳林玉春自杀事件之后，陆续发现福建省的其他县份，南京市，上海市，东北的松江省、本溪市，西南的四川省若干县份，西北的陕西省若干县份，华北的内蒙……都有妇女自杀或被杀事件发生。
    这些事件发生的直接原因，除少数干部对于可能发生的妇女自杀、被杀事件采取不负责任态度，对不堪虐待的妇女提出的离婚请求推拖不作处理，以致引起自杀被杀，主要是有许多干部在处理婚姻纠纷时无原则地盲目劝和，进行强制性的无止境的调解，使一些不堪家庭虐待、与丈夫感情恶劣的妇女陷于绝望，因而自杀或被杀。本溪市碱厂区全家堡子村一对夫妇感情很坏，女方因受虐待，到区人民政府坚决要求离婚。区人民政府的干部无原则地硬性地劝和，不准离婚。女方无奈，三月二十一日上吊自杀。男方也惧罪自杀，幸得救。四川省大竹县黄家乡妇女李春碧一贯受丈夫虐待，解放后就提出离婚，村干部不准。这次运动中又抱着很大希望提出离婚，但仍然只是调解。丈夫知道她要离婚，又把他痛打一顿，逼得她走头无路，抱着孩子跳河自杀，幸遇救未死。陕西城固县鲁家庄有一对夫妇感情恶劣，丈夫把妻子打伤十九处，后来更把妻子关起来，放下刀、绳，威胁妻子实行自杀。妻子逃出，请求离婚，干部却要她“好好回去过日子”。这种强制调解的情形相当普遍，甚至有童养媳和夫家双方都自愿解除婚约的，干部也硬要阻拦，实行和解。以致逼得妇女自杀，或被杀害。
    发生强制调解现象的认识上的根源，第一、是对“家庭和睦、团结生产”的理解上发生了偏差，这就是把“和睦团结”的总目的孤立起来，脱离了婚姻法的根本原则，即“婚姻自由”和“男女权利平等”的原则。不懂得离开了这个原则，就不可能有真正的和睦。中央的补充指示强调指出：“不民主不和睦的家庭应当改善夫妻婆媳关系，使之成为民主和睦的家庭”。这里所说的“民主和睦”，也就是建立在男女平等、婚姻自由基础上的和睦。离开了这一基础去强求所谓“和睦”，就是在实际上维护了野蛮落后的封建婚姻制度，取消了婚姻法，取消了贯彻婚姻法的工作。其结果必然是妇女自杀、被杀事件不断发生，像过去一样。陕西省宝鸡等县有些干部在宣传婚姻法时只讲家庭和睦，尊敬婆婆，不讲男女平等和反对打骂虐待妇女，不敢全面讲解婚姻自由，也不敢联系实际来揭露封建婚姻制度的害处，结果使受虐待的妇女完全失望。宝鸡县一个受虐待的妇女听了工作组的这类报告以后，回家就自杀了。
    这是一个沉痛的教训。
    第二、直接与上述问题相关的，是对“不提倡离婚”的方针的误解，这就是把“不提倡离婚”误解成“反对离婚”或“不许离婚”。陕西省岐山县有的干部在贯彻婚姻法运动中宣传说：“对于要求离婚的是调解调解再调解”。意思就是只能调解，不能批准离婚。在广大群众中直接引起的反响是：“政府政策变了，不许离婚了。”其他地区，也有类似的情形。这些同志不懂得：中央指示说不提倡离婚，是告诉我们不应该主动地多事地去发动人家离婚，而应该耐心地进行调解，使那些有可能和好的夫妻和好起来。而对于那些“夫妻关系十分恶劣、经过调解仍无法继续维持者”，中央则指示我们：“应准予离婚”。这是根据婚姻法第十七条的规定：“男女双方自愿离婚，准予离婚。男女一方坚决要求离婚的，经区人民政府和司法机关调解无效时，亦准予离婚。”这种规定，是我们新民主主义的婚姻制度与封建婚姻制度最根本的区别之一。不这样，就会使感情恶劣的夫妇双方都陷入长期的苦痛之中，影响生产，影响社会秩序，甚至酿成人命案件。由于硬性地限制离婚而发生的人命案件已经太多了，应该不再重复了！
    第三、对“群众观点”和“群众路线”的理解有偏差，有片面性。有些同志这样说：中央要求的是让群众自觉自动地执行婚姻法，按婚姻法办事；要求我们争取社会同情，争取群众拥护。现在群众只能接受“和睦团结”，不能接受婚姻自由，特别是离婚自由，如果我们要讲这种自由，还要这样处理实际问题，那就会脱离群众。有不少干部因此就不敢按法律、按原则办事，甚至讲也不敢讲。这些同志没有想一想，正是因为群众在婚姻问题上有封建落后思想，我们才要开展宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动
    （并在运动之后转为经常工作，继续进行），“系统地批驳旧思想、旧制度和旧习惯，并且树立新思想、新制度和新风气的阵地”（见中央补充指示）。而许多事实已经证明：只要我们能以实例说明利害，说得入情入理，绝大多数群众甚至老年人，都是完全能够接受婚姻自由、男女平等的原则，并且能够同意我们按照这原则去处理实际问题的。问题是我们必须去掉尾巴主义的思想情绪，坚持地、耐心地、生动地向群众进行宣传。是不是说有少数群众坚不同意就不能按法律办事呢？也不是的。法律既经颁布，就是要执行的；而法律的执行是有强制性的。我们一面宣传婚姻法，一面就应该按婚姻法处理实际问题，并且在处理中继续进行宣传，说明这样或那样处理的理由，对群众有什么好处，这样使处理也变成对于政策法令的宣传。只要我们的处理是符合政策法令的，正确的，能和的和了，该离的离了，并且说清了利害，就会促进思想落后者的觉醒。
    第四、有一部分同志似乎以为：中央既然确定了
    “坚持教育的方针”，“对一般人民群众应以进行婚姻法的宣传为限”，那么，实际问题的处理就可以放松或稍为放松一点。有的人甚至说：“没有什么可做的了，讲一讲就行了。”所以他们或者是对群众提出来的问题表示漠不关心，推托不管，或者是以简单方式强制和解，不准离婚，觉得问题不解决也没有什么，又省得处理离婚中的子女、财产等纠纷，省得去说服某些反对离婚的群众。这些同志不懂得：虽然对于一般人民群众应以宣传为限；但是对于已经提出实际问题要求我们帮助解决的群众，    则必须认真地按照政策法令去帮助解决他们的问题。党和人民政府是任何时候都不会容许工作人员不去解决或不去认真地按照政策法令解决群众提出的实际问题的。
    清算和纠正对于中央指示的曲解、误解和片面理解，使所有干部正确地全面地领会中央的指示，是克服强制调解现象和防止妇女自杀被杀事件的关键。在今后继续宣传贯彻婚姻法的经常工作中，各地党政领导机关都应该注意教育干部，从根本上解决上述认识问题。同时要教育实际担负这一工作的干部，使他们了解调解工作的目的，是为了贯彻婚姻法，达到在婚姻自由与男女平等基础上的家庭民主和睦，而不是违反婚姻法去制止离婚，维持那些不可能维持的婚姻关系。调解的方法和态度，应该是按照原则，按照实际情况，实事求是地进行分析，分清哪些是可以和解和应该和解的，哪些是不能和解和不应该和解的，然后分别进行不同的处理。反对无原则地“和稀泥”，当庸俗的“和事佬”。调解的权限，应只限于调解。经过调解后双方都真正同意了，和解才能成立；有一方坚持不同意，就应该交司法机关判决。调解者无权强制“和解”，也无权作无止境的实际是取消了当事人的上告权的所谓“再调解”。
    另外还必须注意到：有一些干部所以发生强制调解的错误，并不仅只是由于对中央指示认识上有偏差，而是还有封建的思想意识在作怪。福建南平县徐洋乡乡长在贯彻婚姻法运动中曾经明白地表示：
    “我一看见离婚就头痛”。这里反映着相当一部分基层干部的思想情况。他们对于离婚事件不仅是嫌麻烦，而且是根本看不惯。在徐洋乡，有一对青年夫妻，双方都因原来另有所爱而坚决要求离婚，而干部也硬要给人家和解，坚不许离。对于这种站在封建婚姻制度立场上处理婚姻纠纷的干部，除了晓以政策法令外，还需要进行反封建的教育。
    最后应该说明：我们并不是反对调解或反对耐心的调解，并不是主张“来告即离”。对于那些真有感情的夫妻，仅仅因为一些不是不可以克服的原因而要求离婚，但有可能重新和好的，还是应该进行耐心的调解和教育，使他们恢复和好，团结生产。各地已有许多事实证明，这种教育和调解是完全可以生效的。但是我们坚决反对任何强制的和无止境的调解，反对以封建的原则进行违反婚姻法的调解。
