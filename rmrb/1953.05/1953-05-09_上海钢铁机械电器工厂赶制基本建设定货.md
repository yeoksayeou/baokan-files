Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th. Shanghai's steel, machinery, and electrical industries are rushing to produce various orders to support capital construction across the country. This year, the orders placed with Shanghai factories by capital construction departments across the country have exceeded the levels previously achieved by Shanghai's industry in terms of quantity, variety, and technical specifications. In terms of smelting equipment, the orders include a fourteen-ton vacuum filter (ore dressing machine), a fifty-four-ton waste gas heat recovery device, a twenty-ton wet ball mill, as well as gas generators, electrostatic precipitators, vacuum pumps, mortar pumps, and so on. These have never been manufactured domestically before. In terms of equipment for industrial and mining enterprises, water conservancy projects, and forest logging, many are new machines requiring special design. For example, these include a one-hundred-ton electric overhead traveling crane, a thirty-five-ton Soviet-style boiler, a 200-horsepower or more gas engine, huge gates and gate lifting machinery, as well as various specifications of machine tools, motors, electrical equipment, and steel.

The city's state-owned and private steel mills are manufacturing seventy-five types of steel for more than five hundred capital construction units. Among them, light rails for forest railways and construction site transportation are items they had not cast before. Now these products can be produced in large quantities.

The first domestically produced vacuum filter has been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Wusong Machine Factory. The joint state-private New China Machine Factory manufactured more than forty vacuum pumps and mortar pumps in April; the state-owned Pujiang Machine Factory manufactured several gas generators in April. Workers in the factory's crane workshop will begin manufacturing a large one-hundred-ton crane in May. From November last year to April this year, the state-owned Shanghai Wire Factory manufactured more than sixty types of Soviet-specification cables for Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and preliminary tests have shown that they all meet the specifications.

In the manufacture of these new products, the employees of many factories have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. For example, when the Xin'ya Machine Factory was manufacturing the fifty-four-ton waste gas heat recovery device, worker Zhang Genbao and others modified the machine tools, installing a cross-cutting arm on a shaper with a width of only half a meter, and installing two planing tools at both ends, so that the planing tool could plane a one-meter-wide water tank iron plate. The factory's workers also learned advanced technologies such as cyclone cutting, which greatly improved the efficiency of the machine tools. In the first half of this year, the factory will be able to produce more machines of various types than it did in the entire past year.

### 上海钢铁机械电器工厂赶制基本建设定货

    上海钢铁机械电器工厂赶制基本建设定货
    【新华社上海八日电】上海市钢铁、机械和电器工业部门正在赶制各种定货，支援全国各地基本建设。今年各地基本建设部门向上海各厂的定货，无论数量、品种和技术规范都超过上海工业过去所达到过的水平。在冶炼设备方面，定货中有十四吨重的真空过滤机（选矿机），五十四吨重的废气收热器，二十吨重的湿式球磨机，以及煤气发生炉、电气收尘器、真空泵、砂浆泵等。这些都是国内从未制造过的。在工矿企业、水利工程和森林采伐设备方面，有很多是需要特殊设计的新机器。例如其中有吊重一百吨的电动起重行车，三十五吨的苏式锅炉，二百匹马力以上的煤气引擎，巨大的闸门和闸门起重机械，以及各种规格的工具机、电机、电气设备和钢材。
    全市国营和私营钢铁厂正在为五百多个基本建设单位制造七十五种钢材。其中如森林铁道和工地运输的轻轨，都是他们过去没有铸造过的。现在这些产品已能大量生产。
    国内第一台自制的真空过滤机，已在国营吴淞机器厂试制成功。公私合营新中机器厂四月份已造好真空泵、砂浆泵四十多台；国营浦江机器厂四月份内已制造出几座煤气发生炉。该厂行车车间工人，在五月份要开始制造吊重一百吨的大行车。国营上海电线厂从去年十一月到今年四月，为鞍山钢铁公司制造了六十多种苏联规格的电缆，经初步试验都合规格。
    在这些新产品制造中，许多工厂的职工都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。如新亚机器厂在制造五十四吨重的废气收热器时，工人张根宝等改造了工具机，把横幅只有半公尺的牛头刨床安装上一根横刀臂，两头装两把刨刀，结果使刨刀能刨一公尺宽的水箱铁板。这个工厂的工人，还学习了旋风切削法等先进技术，使工具机的效率大大提高。今年上半年，该厂就能生产出比过去一年的产量还要多的各种机器。
