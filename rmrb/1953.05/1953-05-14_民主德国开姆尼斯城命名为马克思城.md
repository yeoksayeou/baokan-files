Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 13th: The industrial center of Chemnitz in the state of Lower Saxony, Democratic Germany, and its administrative district have been renamed Karl Marx City and Karl Marx District. This is a major event held by the German Democratic Republic in 1953 – the year of Karl Marx.

	On May 10th, a grand naming ceremony was held on Stalin Square in the city center. 180,000 people attended. Walter Ulbricht, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, said at the meeting that, thanks to the efforts and creativity of the working people, Chemnitz has been rebuilt from the ruins after the war. It is a supreme honor that this city is now named after Karl Marx, the great teacher of the international proletariat, the outstanding son of the German nation, and the founder of scientific socialism. After receiving its new name, this city will further become a center of socialist construction in the Democratic Republic, and a center of machine and heavy machine manufacturing serving to improve the lives of the working people and increase the wealth of the people.

	Chemnitz has a population of 300,000 and is one of the earliest industrialized cities in Germany, and one of the birthplaces of the modern German workers' movement. After the mid-19th century, it was the center of the German textile industry. Later, machine manufacturing industries such as steam engine and locomotive factories were gradually established. In 1903, a famous large-scale strike of workers occurred here. During the economic crisis and revolutionary era after the First World War, there was hardly a factory in this area that had not experienced a strike. In the era of the Weimar Republic and after Hitler came to power, the class struggle became more acute, and conflicts between workers and police frequently occurred. This industrial and mining area was also where Ernst Thälmann, the leader of the German Communist Party, often came to lead the workers' struggle. According to the decision of the government of the German Democratic Republic, this city and its nearby mining areas, together with Dresden, Magdeburg, and Rostock, will become important bases for socialist construction in the Five-Year Plan.

    民主德国开姆尼斯城命名为马克思城
    【新华社柏林十三日电】德意志民主共和国下萨克森州的工业中心开姆尼斯城及其所辖专区已命名为卡尔·马克思城和卡尔·马克思专区。这是德意志民主共和国在一九五三年——卡尔·马克思年举办的一件大事。
    五月十日，在该市中心区斯大林广场上举行了隆重的命名典礼。到会的有十八万人。德国统一社会党主席、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在会上说：由于劳动人民的努力和创造，战后开姆尼斯从废墟中重新建立了起来。这一城市现在用国际无产阶级的伟大导师、德国民族的优秀儿子和科学社会主义的创始人卡尔·马克思的名字来命名，这是无上的光荣。这一城市获得了它的新名称以后，将进一步成为民主共和国社会主义建设的中心，成为一个为改善劳动人民的生活和增加人民的财富而服务的机器和重机器制造业的中心。
    开姆尼斯城共有三十万人口，是德国工业发达较早的城市，也是德国现代工人运动的发源地之一。在十九世纪中叶以后，它是德国纺织业的中心，以后，机器制造业如蒸汽机及火车头工厂也逐渐设立起来。一九零三年，在这里曾发生过著名的职工大罢工。在第一次世界大战后经济危机与革命的年代，这一地区几乎没有一个工厂不曾发生过罢工。在魏玛共和国时代及希特勒上台以后，阶级斗争更加尖锐化了，工人与警察的冲突事件经常发生。这一带工矿区也曾是德国共产党领袖台尔曼常常到来领导工人斗争的地区。根据德意志民主共和国政府的决定，这一城市及其附近的矿区将与德累斯顿，马格德堡与罗斯托克一起成为五年计划中社会主义建设的重要基地。
