    Cooperatives Should Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Supplying Agricultural Production Materials

    Editor's Note: Adapting to the needs of local farmers at the time and systematically organizing the supply of agricultural production materials is one of the important tasks of rural supply and marketing cooperatives. The following excerpts from readers' letters expose the erroneous practices of several cooperatives in Taolin County, Suiyuan Province, and Qian County, Shaanxi Province, in not thoroughly studying the needs of local farmers in the supply of agricultural production materials, simply pursuing profits, or being passively negligent. These practices have had a negative impact on farmers' production and deserve serious attention. It is recommended that the aforementioned cooperatives promptly examine and improve their supply of production materials. It is also hoped that the broad masses of readers will continue to expose similar situations so that the supply of production materials by cooperatives can better serve agricultural production under the supervision of the masses.

    Taolin Cooperative's Supply of Agricultural Tools Shows Serious Capitalist Management Ideology

    A letter from Xun Ziyi and Xu Guicheng of the Production Office of Taolin County, Suiyuan Province: The prices of agricultural tools supplied by the Taolin County Cooperative Union exceed general market prices, causing dissatisfaction among farmers. The harrow fish supplied by the county union were ordered from Zhuozi County and other places last year at a cost of 20,000 yuan per piece, and the freight was less than 2,000 yuan. However, the county union added a profit of 3,100 yuan, wholesaling them to grassroots cooperatives for 25,100 yuan. The grassroots cooperatives then added freight and profit, and the selling price of the Chengguan Cooperative, located on the same street as the county union, reached 26,900 yuan. The selling price for other grassroots cooperatives would be 28,000 yuan. The cost plus freight of each seed drill supplied by the county union was 79,500 yuan, but the wholesale price reached 93,500 yuan; the selling price of the Chengguan Cooperative was 100,300 yuan.

    In addition, the price of iron rakes manufactured by the local Tie-Mu Joint Production Cooperative was 210,000 yuan, but the county union insisted that all grassroots cooperatives must purchase through the county union. As a result, the county union added a profit of 19,000 yuan, and the Chengguan Cooperative added some profit, selling them to farmers for 255,300 yuan. Thus, each rake turned several corners in the county seat, becoming 45,300 yuan more expensive than the original price.

    In short, the prices of the seven types of agricultural tools supplied by the county union are very high, with profits ranging from a minimum of 13% to a maximum of 19%. Farmers believe this situation is unreasonable and have raised many opinions. As a result, many agricultural tools in cooperatives throughout the county are stockpiled because the masses of farmers are unwilling to buy them. It is understood that the Tieshagai Grassroots Cooperative in the Fifth District alone has stockpiled 500 harrow fish, 10 seed mixing devices, and 74 seed drills.

    The Taolin County People's Government accepted the opinions of the masses and organized an inspection team to conduct an inspection of the county union on April 3, confirming the situation reported by the masses. However, Chen Daoke, the director of the county union, still did not recognize the seriousness of the erroneous practices of the county union. After the inspection, the county union adjusted the prices of agricultural tools, but they are still high in comparison.

    It is recommended that the Suiyuan Provincial Cooperative Federation help the county union recognize its mistakes, improve its operations, and do a good job in supplying agricultural tools.

    Qian County Union Should Not Take a Passive Attitude
    Towards the Supply of Pesticides

    Reader Duan Wenjie writes: The Qian County Cooperative Union in Shaanxi Province has stockpiled a large quantity of "Ceresan" pesticides for farmers to use for seed treatment. As of April 22, most local farmers had already planted their seeds while the soil was moist, but there were still 600 catties of pesticides unopened in the cooperative. The reason for the stockpile is that the county union believes that mobilizing the masses to buy pesticides is the responsibility of government agencies and has nothing to do with the cooperative; and that the cooperative cadres should just sit and wait for the masses to come and buy them. The responsible cadres of the Qian County Construction Section have criticized this idea several times, but the leading cadres of the cooperative do not care. In addition, the cooperative does not transport the pesticides to the grassroots cooperatives in a timely manner; farmers use very small amounts of pesticides, and the road to the city is long, so they are even less likely to come and buy them. The Qian County Magistrate personally raised his opinion with the director of the county union on this matter, and the county union then transported the pesticides to the grassroots cooperatives. But this was too late; most farmers had already finished planting when the pesticides were transported to the grassroots cooperatives.

    Spring plowing is the overriding central task in rural areas, and promoting pesticide seed treatment is an important task in spring planting. The leading cadres of the Qian County Union's attitude of indifference to the interests of farmers should be severely criticized.

### 合作社应该认真做好  农业生产资料的供应工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    合作社应该认真做好
    农业生产资料的供应工作
    编者按：适应当地当时农民的需要，有计划地组织农业生产资料的供应工作，是农村供销合作社的重要任务之一。下面摘要发表的几封读者来信，揭发了绥远陶林县、陕西乾县几个合作社在供应农业生产资料工作中不很好研究当地农民需要，单纯追求利润或消极被动等的错误做法。这些做法都使农民生产受到坏的影响。这是值得重视的。建议上述合作社迅速检查和改进生产资料的供应工作，并希望广大读者继续揭发类似情况，以使合作社生产资料供应工作能够在群众监督下更好的为农业生产服务。
    陶林合作社农具供应工作中
    资本主义经营思想严重
    绥远省陶林县生产办公室郇子仪、徐贵成来信：陶林县合作社联合社供应的农具价格超过一般市价，引起农民不满。县社供应的耱鱼系去年由卓资县等地订购的，每片原价两万元，运费也不到二千元。县社却加上三千一百多元利润，以二万五千一百元批给基层社；基层社又加上运费和利润，和县社在一条街上的城关合作社售价就达二万六千九百元，其它基层社售价就要到二万八千元。县社供应的分籽耧每支成本加运费为七万九千五百元，但批发价竟达九万三千五百元；城关合作社售价是十万零三千元。
    此外，本城铁木联营生产合作社制造的铁耙价格是二十一万元，但县社强调各基层社必须通过县社才许进货，结果县社加利润一万九千元，城关合作社又加一些利润，卖给农民就要二十五万五千三百元。这样，每片耙在县城里转了几个弯，就比原价高了四万五千三百元。
    总之，县社供应的七种农具价格都很高，利润最低占百分之十三，高的达百分之十九。农民们认为这种情况不合理，纷纷提出意见。而全县各合作社的农具，因为农民群众不愿买，积压很多。据了解，仅五区铁沙盖基层社就积压耱鱼五百片，拌种器十具，耧七十四支。
    陶林县人民政府接受群众的意见，组织检查组在四月三日到县社进行检查，证实了群众反映的情况。但该社主任陈道科仍未认识该社错误做法的严重性。经检查后，县社虽调整农具价格，但比起来还是高。
    建议绥远省合作总社帮助该社认识错误，改善经营，做好农具供应工作。
    乾县县联社不应用消极态度
    对待农药供应工作
    读者段文杰来信：陕西省乾县合作联合社积压大批供农民拌种用的“赛力散”药剂。直到四月二十二日，当地大部分农民已趁墒下种，但还有六百斤药剂原封未动存在合作社。积压药剂的原因是县联社认为发动群众购买农药是政府机关的事，与合作社无关；而合作社干部只要坐着等群众来买就行了。乾县建设科负责干部几次对该社这种思想提出批评，该社领导干部也不在乎。再加上该社又不把药剂适时运到各基层社；农民用药量很少，进城路远，就更不来买了。乾县县长为此亲自向县联社主任提意见，县联社才把药剂运到基层社。但这已成了马后炮，药剂运到基层社时大部分农民已播种完毕了。
    春耕生产是农村压倒一切的中心工作，而推广药剂拌种又是春播中的一项重要工作。乾县县联社领导干部对农民利益采取漠不关心的态度，应该受到严格批评。
