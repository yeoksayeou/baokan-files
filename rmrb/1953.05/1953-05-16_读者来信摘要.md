    Reader's Letters Summary
    Should Fully Utilize Accumulated Materials
    ——Reader's Letters Brief Comments
    Several reader's letters published in today's "Reader's Letters Summary" column reflect an important issue in our materials management work. As far as we know, across the country, there are still large quantities of surplus materials from inventory clearances and surplus obsolete materials from enterprise asset verification that have not been processed and fully utilized, resulting in long-term accumulation and losses. The situations revealed in the readers' letters are part of this.
    There are two reasons for this unreasonable phenomenon: first, some materials management and disposal departments are conservative and passive in their work, holding a simple fiscal revenue perspective of "waiting for the highest price"; second, some materials and procurement departments have incorrect ideas such as favoring new materials, disliking old goods, and fearing trouble, and are unwilling to prioritize the utilization of these materials. At present, the latter ideological tendency is the main one.
    The consequences of this unreasonable situation are: it causes the state to spend large amounts of storage costs, and makes the accumulated materials increasingly damaged; at the same time, the task of national material reserves is affected because the warehouse space is occupied for a long time. This serious situation of harming national interests should never continue. It is hoped that financial and economic leading agencies and relevant departments in various regions will handle them quickly according to the principles of carefully organizing appraisal and mastering professional materials returning to the team, distinguishing between means of production and means of livelihood: on the one hand, through the materials distribution departments, grasp the material purchase and preparation work of enterprise departments, so as to prioritize allocation and mutual exchange and adjust existing inventory materials and obsolete materials; on the other hand, instruct each enterprise unit to systematically repair and utilize these materials, or make other appropriate arrangements. Before the materials are processed, each storage or entrusted unit should do its best to store and maintain them in the spirit of cherishing the people's property, so as to avoid or reduce the loss of national materials.
    Northeast First Materials Reserve Depot Has Long-Term Accumulation of Large Quantities of Materials
    A letter from the Secretariat Section of the First Reserve Department of the Northeast Branch of the State Materials Reserve Bureau: A large number of "non-national reserve materials" in the Northeast First Materials Reserve Depot have caused losses due to increased costs and even mildew and deterioration because they have not been processed for a long time. In the second quarter of 1952, our department received a large number of inventory materials according to the instructions of the former Northeast Finance Department. Some of these materials have high costs and low quality, such as a batch of wool that has been eaten by insects, but the price is one-third higher than the market price; some are military materials that were turned over to our department for disposal due to non-conforming specifications, such as peaked caps, copper buttons, rubber boots, blankets, belts, saddles, etc.; some materials have deteriorated or cannot be used. At that time, the higher authorities only took care of the convenience of the closing unit to carry out the cleaning work, regardless of the material cost or quality, and all were handed over to us at the original price. After we received it, we repeatedly asked the higher authorities to put forward disposal opinions; however, because these materials were too expensive or difficult to find sales channels, the higher authorities did not make a decision for a long time. In order to store these materials, the state has spent a lot of costs on reversing the library, drying, wiping, packaging, etc.; the cost of these materials is therefore getting higher and higher. At the same time, the long-term occupation of warehouses by this batch of materials directly affected the task of taking over the national reserve materials, so that the newly taken over valuable materials had to be stored in sheds or in the open air.
    In addition, in 1949, our warehouse allocated a large number of building materials for the construction of the project of our unit. Except for the part used, the rest were accumulated in the warehouse. Now some of them have rusted and deteriorated, and some have been damaged due to reversing the library or open-air storage. These equipment are very useful in national construction, and some are currently difficult to buy on the market. It is really sad to let them accumulate for a long time. We believe that if these materials are not needed by our unit, they should be transferred to the departments that need them in time for utilization.
    The disposal of the above-mentioned materials does have many objective difficulties; however, the fear of responsibility by some leading cadres and the simple financial income point of view are also important reasons for the long-term accumulation of materials. For example, a large batch of "tanning compounds" stored in a warehouse in our office was not processed last year just because of a price difference of 200 yuan per kilogram. Later, the packaging of this batch of goods leaked, corroded the cement floor of a warehouse, and was moved from one warehouse to another. It not only wasted national property, but also had no way to sell it, so it had to be stored there.
    The Henan Materials Bureau Didn't Sell Generators When They Were Brand New, and No One Wanted Them After They Were Damaged
    A letter from Jin Zhengrong of the Henan Materials Bureau: In 1949, the state-owned Yiluo Coal Mine used to manage a 500 kW brand-new generator on behalf of the Henan Materials Bureau. In 1951, the central government approved the allocation of the generator to the mine for 2.2 billion yuan; at the same time, the Longmen Coal Mine under the Henan Provincial Department of Industry was also willing to buy the generator at the same price. The Henan Materials Bureau took the opportunity to raise the price to 3 billion yuan, and as a result, neither party bought it.
    The generator was not sold, but it was not well-maintained. It was stored in the field for a long time, and as a result, a large number of important parts were lost. At the end of last year, the Henan Materials Bureau reached an agreement with the Henan Provincial Department of Industry to allocate it to the Department of Industry for repair and use at a price of 1 billion yuan. However, the Provincial Department of Industry recently overturned the agreement and bought two new 500 kW generators in Xuzhou. In this way, this valuable machine, which was brand new and can still be repaired, continues to be damaged day by day by wind and sun. I hope the leading agencies attach importance to this issue and properly handle this machine quickly.
    Large Quantities of Materials Long-Term Accumulation Not Processed in Northeast and Shanghai Materials Management Departments
    A letter from reader Bai Lian: As far as I know, there are a lot of vulcanized straw yellow and vulcanized khaki dyes stored in the Shanghai warehouses of the materials management department. Because the colors of these dyes are similar to those of military and police uniforms, it is inconvenient to sell them to the market; the storage department has asked the military and public security departments to consider using these dyes, but because the colors are not suitable, the above-mentioned departments are also unwilling to adopt them. Therefore, this batch of materials has been accumulated for several years without being processed. I think that such a large amount of national materials should be utilized in some way, and should not be accumulated for a long time.
    In addition, the warehouses of the Northeast Materials Reserve Bureau have accumulated a large number of substandard military uniforms, about 200,000 sets, which have not been processed for a long time and occupy a large number of warehouses. I hope the leadership can actively come up with solutions.
    Materials Stored at the Foot of the South Wall of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing Should Be Handled Quickly to Avoid Losses
    A letter from Yang Songlin, Beijing No. 21 Middle School: In mid-April, we went to the Temple of Heaven to play, and saw a "warehouse" surrounded by iron wires at the foot of the south wall of the Temple of Heaven, which contained a pile of broken engines, fuel tanks and other materials. These materials will suffer great losses if they are left to be eroded by wind and rain and exposed to the sun for a long time. It is hoped that the leading agency of this warehouse will handle this batch of materials as soon as possible with a responsible attitude towards national property.
    Why Did the North China Administrative Committee Guesthouse Dismiss Yang Wanqi's Work?
    A letter from reader Ba Yi: It is unreasonable that Yang Wanqi, a civil servant of the North China Administrative Committee Guesthouse, was dismissed due to marriage problems. Yang Wanqi, who was originally an apprentice in an iron factory, was introduced to the guesthouse in 1952 to burn boilers, and this spring he was transferred to work in the guesthouse's reception room. He has always been active in his work and has made great progress in his studies. Jiang Yuelan, the nanny of the child of Comrade Ren of the North China Administrative Committee, and her husband, who had an arranged marriage by her parents, divorced through legal procedures. Because she and Yang Wanqi often met, they gradually developed feelings and decided to get engaged. Yang Wanqi applied to the administration for engagement, but the administrator Liu Wenyu did not reply. One Saturday night, Yang Wanqi took a leave of absence and went to the street with Jiang Yuelan to talk about his marriage, and because he did not pay attention to the time, he did not return until 12 o'clock at night. The next day, Jiang Yuelan was fired. Zhang Wenxiang, the chief of the reception section of the North China Administrative Committee, heard others say that the two of them were "engaged in improper love," and also notified Yang Wanqi by phone to leave the guesthouse. Yang Wanqi had no choice but to leave with tears. I think that marriage law and freedom of marriage are being promoted everywhere. I wonder who can be free? Yang Wanqi and Jiang Yuelan's love is nothing "improper", and is completely in accordance with the marriage law, but why were they dismissed from their jobs? I hope that the comrades in charge of the reception section of the North China Administrative Committee will reconsider Yang Wanqi's work issue.
    Handling of Readers' Letters in Two Weeks
    From April 27 to May 10, the reader's letter group of this newspaper received a total of 3,537 reader's letters, and various agencies replied to 744 reader's letters. Among them, 1,529 letters were related to political and legal issues, 1,156 letters were related to cultural and educational issues, 1,524 letters were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, and 72 letters were of other nature. 68 pieces were published in this newspaper, 958 readers were replied individually, 1,819 pieces were transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, processing, reply or reference, and 1,444 pieces were kept for reference by this newspaper and did not need to be processed again; some of these are letters left over from the past. During this period, the reader's letter group of this newspaper issued a total of 4,431 replies to readers, transferred to relevant agencies for investigation and processing, and expedited letters. In addition, there were 711 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers looking for revolutionary soldiers, and the number was not included in the statistics.
    During these two weeks, many readers continued to send condolence letters to the sick and wounded captured volunteers who returned to the motherland; we have selected some of them for comprehensive summary and publication. We have also received many reader's letters expressing their willingness to assist the People's Government in doing a good job in the population survey and registration work with practical actions, and put forward some positive suggestions; some readers have also raised some questions about this work; we are preparing to select some letters for summary and publication, and make public replies to some important questions. Some letters reflect the situation of some agencies and cadres not paying attention to confidentiality work, and we are preparing to summarize and publish them.
    During these two weeks, we received many reader's letters reflecting many problems in leading agricultural production work, handicraft industry, fishery and animal husbandry production; reflecting some deviations in the financial and trade and cooperative agencies in supplying agricultural production materials, purchasing agricultural products, issuing agricultural loans, and carrying out livestock insurance work; reflecting the mildew of food and other materials that have occurred since the beginning of spring; reflecting the situation of production and disaster relief work; reflecting that the coal produced by some coal mines contains a large amount of stone, resulting in a serious waste of transportation and national property; reflecting the impracticality of requisitioning and allocating wood, resulting in a large accumulation and even decay of wood; reflecting that some stations have not really assumed their responsibilities in the implementation of the "responsible transportation" work, resulting in damage and shortage of goods. We are studying the above issues, and we will select some summaries for publication. There are also some readers' letters reflecting the ideological situation of local rural cadres and farmers, which is of great help to us in understanding the rural situation, and we have kept it as information.
    During these two weeks, we also received reader's letters putting forward some opinions on the rectification of secondary schools; reflecting the problem of untimely supply of textbooks in middle schools in Hunan and Hebei; we have transferred them to the relevant leading agencies for reference and responsible for solving them. Some letters put forward opinions on the work of cultural centers in various places, and we are currently studying them comprehensively.
    In addition, the reader's letters reporting mines have been transferred to the Central Geological Department for direct processing; the letters inquiring about methods for preventing and controlling natural disasters of crops have been transferred to the Plant Protection Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture for direct reply; the letters putting forward opinions on the traffic order in Beijing have been transferred to the Beijing Municipal People's Government for reference; the letters inquiring about family composition and requesting to resolve land disputes have been transferred to the local People's Government for reply and processing according to the specific situation; The letters inquiring about the application procedures for schools at all levels, we believe that readers can directly inquire from the admissions institutions of each school when they enroll in the fall of this year; The letters from on-the-job cadres inquiring about participating in higher education studies, because this year's quota for transferring on-the-job cadres to higher education institutions has been allocated by the Central Higher Education Department, and each unit will uniformly allocate them according to the specific situation, readers can directly learn about it from the affiliated leading agencies; The "Reader's Letter Review" on the third edition of this newspaper on May 9, entitled "Further Improve the Planned Distribution of Newspapers and Periodicals," has summarized the situation reflected by readers and put forward solutions to the problems of chaos in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the General Administration of Publications have also taken effective measures to improve the above-mentioned phenomena. We will no longer reply to the above letters individually.
    Finally, some reader's letters did not specify the real name and detailed address, which makes it difficult for us to reply. It is hoped that readers who write letters in the future must specify the real name and detailed address; we will be responsible for keeping secret those who do not want to reveal their name and address.

    读者来信摘要
    应该把积压着的物资充分利用起来
    ——读者来信简评
    今天“读者来信摘要”栏所发表的几封读者来信，反映出我们物资保管工作中的一个重要问题。据我们所知，全国各地尚有大批清仓剩余物资及企业核资所多余的呆废材料，至今未能处理与充分利用，致长期积压，造成损失。读者来信所揭发的情况就是其中的一部分。
    造成这种不合理现象的原因有二：第一是某些物资管理与处理部门工作保守被动，有“待价而估”的单纯财政收入观点；第二是某些用料与采购部门有喜新物、厌旧货、怕麻烦等不正确的思想，不愿尽先利用这批物资。而在目前，后一种思想倾向是主要的。
    这种不合理的情况所造成的后果是：既使国家支出大批保管费用，又使被积压的物资日益损坏；而同时因仓库地位长期被占，国家储备物资的任务也会受到影响。这种严重损害国家利益的情况是绝不应继续存在下去了。希望各地财经领导机关和有关部门，分别生产资料与生活资料，按认真组织鉴定、掌握专业物资归队的原则加以迅速处理：一方面通过物资分配部门，掌握企业部门的购料、备料工作情况，做到尽先调拨与互相交换调剂现存的清仓物资与呆废材料；一方面责成各企业单位对这类物资有计划地整修利用，或作其他适当处理。在物资未能处理前，各保管或代管单位，应本爱护人民财产的精神，尽力加以保管护养，以避免或减少国家物资的损失。
    东北第一物资储备处长期积压大批物资
    国家物资储备局东北分局第一储备处秘书科来信：东北第一物资储备处的大批“非国家储备性物资”，因为长期不得处理，造成了成本增加、甚至霉烂变质的损失。 一九五二年第二季度，我处根据原东北财政部的指示，接收了大批库存物资。这些物资，有的成本高、质量低，如有一批羊毛已虫蚀，而价格却高出市价三分之一；有的是因规格不合而缴给我处处理的军用物资，如大盖帽、铜扣子、胶靴、毯子、皮带、马鞍等；有的物资则已经变质或不能利用了。当时上级只照顾结束单位便于进行清理工作，不管物资成本高低、质量如何，一律按原价交给我们。我们接收后，曾屡次要求上级提出处理意见；但因为这些物资成本太高或难于找到销路，上级也长期不作处理决定。为了保管这批物资，国家又支出了大批的倒库、晾晒、拭擦、包装等费用；这些物资的成本因此越来越高。同时，这批物资长期占用仓库，直接影响了国家储备物资的接管任务，使得新接管的贵重物资，只好搭席棚或露天存放。
    另外，我库在一九四九年为了修建本单位的工程，拨运了大批建筑材料，这些材料，除用了一部分外，其余都积压在仓库里，现在有的已生锈变质，有的因为倒库或露天存放而被损坏。这些器材在国家建设中是很有用的，有的目前市场上还很难买到，任其长期积压，实在令人痛心。我们认为：这些物资如本单位用不着了，就应该及时调拨给需要它们的部门去加以利用。
    上述物资的处理固然有许多客观困难；但某些领导干部怕负责任和单纯的财政收入观点，也是造成物资长期积压的重要原因。例如，我处一库保管的大批“丹宁化合物”，前年仅因每公斤差价二百元而没有得到处理。后来这批东西包装漏了，侵蚀了一库库房的洋灰地，由一库搬到二库，不但浪费了国家财产，而且欲售无门，只好任其存放下去。
    河南物资管理局所存发电机全新时不卖掉残破后无人要
    河南省物资管理局金争荣来信：一九四九年，国营宜洛煤矿曾代管河南省物资管理局五百瓩全新发电机一部。一九五一年，中央曾批准以二十二亿的价格拨交该矿留用；同时河南省工业厅所属龙门煤矿亦愿以同一价格购买这部发电机。河南省物资管理局乃乘机抬价至三十亿元，结果双方都没有买成。
    这部发电机没卖掉，但也没被很好保管，长期在野外存放，结果大批重要零件丢失了。去年年底，河南省物资管理局与河南省工业厅达成协议，决定以十亿元价格拨交工业厅修理使用。但最近省工业厅却推翻了这项协议，到徐州买了两部五百瓩的新发电机。就这样，这部本是全新而目前尚能修复使用的贵重机器，就继续任凭风吹日晒，一天一天损坏下去了。我希望领导机关重视这个问题，迅速妥善处理这部机器。
    东北和上海的物资管理部门大批物资长期积压未得处理
    读者百炼来信：据我所知，在物资管理部门的上海仓库中，存有很多硫化草黄及硫化卡叽两种染料。这批染料的颜色因为与军警服装的颜色相仿，故不便向市场出卖；保管部门曾要求军事部门和公安部门考虑使用这批染料，但由于颜色不适合，上述两部门亦不愿采用。这批物资因此就积压了数年未作处理。我认为：这样大量的国家物资，应该设法利用起来，而不应长期积压下去。
    此外，东北物资储备局的仓库中积存了大批不合规格的军用服装约二十余万套，长期未作处理，占用了大量的仓库。希望领导方面积极想出处理办法。
    北京天坛南墙脚下所存物资应迅速处理以免受损失
    北京市第二十一中学杨松林来信：四月中旬，我们到天坛去玩，在天坛南墙脚下看到一个铁丝圈起来的“仓库”，里面存放了一大堆破乱的发动机、油箱等物资。这些物资，长期任凭风雨侵蚀、太阳曝晒，将受很大损失。希望这个仓库的领导机关以对国家财产负责的态度，赶快处理这批物资。
    华北行政委员会招待所为何解除杨万起的工作
    读者八一来信：华北行政委员会招待所公务员杨万起因婚姻问题被开除，很不合理。杨万起，铁工厂学徒出身，一九五二年被介绍到该招待所烧锅炉，今年春天调该招待所传达室工作。他一向工作积极，学习上也大有进步。华北行政委员会任科同志的孩子的保姆蒋月兰，和父母包办婚姻的丈夫经法定手续离婚后，因和杨万起经常见面，渐渐有了情感，并决定订婚。杨万起向行政上申请订婚，管理员刘文郁一直不作答复。一个星期六晚上，杨万起请假后和蒋月兰到街上且走且谈自己的婚姻事，因为没有注意时间，直谈到夜里十二时才返回。第二天，蒋月兰便被解雇。华北行政委员会招待科科长张文祥听别人说他俩“搞不正当恋爱”，也便用电话通知杨万起离开招待所。杨万起没有办法，只好含泪而去。我想，到处在宣传婚姻法、婚姻自由，不知什么人才能自由？杨万起和蒋月兰恋爱，没有什么“不正当”的，完全合乎婚姻法，但为什么他俩竟被解除工作呢？我希望华北行政委员会招待科负责同志应从新考虑杨万起的工作问题。
    两周读者来信处理情况
    四月二十七日到五月十日，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信三千五百三十七件，各机关答复读者信七百四十四件。其中有关政法问题的一千五百二十九件，有关文教问题的一千一百五十六件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的一千五百二十四件，其它性质的七十二件。在本报发表的六十八件，个别答复读者的九百五十八件，转请各有关机关调查、处理、答复或参考的一千八百十九件，留存本报参考以及不需再作处理的一千四百四十四件；这里有一部分是以前留下的信件。在这一时期中，本报读者来信组共发出答复读者、转请有关机关调查处理和催办信四千四百三十一件。此外，还有革命军人家属寻找革命军人的信七百十一件，数字未统计在内。
    这两周中，继续有不少读者寄来给返回祖国的志愿军病伤被俘人员的慰问信；我们已选择一部分综合摘要发表。我们还收到不少读者来信，表示愿以实际行动协助人民政府做好人口调查登记工作，并提出了一些积极性的建议；还有一些读者对这个工作提出了一些问题；我们准备选择一部分来信摘要发表，并就某些重要的问题作公开答复。有一些来信反映某些机关、干部不重视保密工作的情况，我们准备综合发表。
    这两周中，我们收到不少读者来信，反映有关领导农业生产工作中的、手工业、渔业和畜牧业生产中的不少问题；反映财经、贸易和合作社机构在供应农业生产资料、收购农产品、发放农贷以及进行牲畜保险工作中的一些偏向；反映入春以来保管食粮和其它物资已发生霉烂的情况；反映生产救灾工作的情况；反映有的煤矿所产的煤中含有大量石头，以致严重浪费运输力和国家财产的情况；反映领用和拨发木材时不切实际而造成木材大量积压甚至腐烂的情况；反映有的车站在实行“负责运输” 工作中没真正负起责任，以致发生货物磨损、短少事故的情况。以上问题，我们都正进行研究，并将选择一部分摘要发表。还有一些读者来信反映了当地农村干部和农民的思想情况，这对我们了解农村情况有很大的帮助，我们已留作资料。
    这两周中，我们还收到读者来信提出了对整顿中等学校问题的一些意见；反映了湖南、河北中学教科书供应不及时的问题；我们已转请有关领导机关参考并负责解决。有些来信对各地文化馆工作提出意见，我们正在综合研究。
    此外，读者报矿的来信，我们已转请中央地质部直接处理；询问农作物自然灾害防治方法的来信，我们已转请中央农业部植物保护司直接答复；对北京市交通秩序提出意见的来信，我们已转请北京市人民政府参考；询问家庭成分及要求解决土地纠纷的来信，我们已转当地人民政府根据具体情况来答复和处理；询问各级学校投考手续问题的来信，我们认为读者可在今秋各该校招生时直接向招生机构询问；在职干部询问参加高等学校学习问题的来信，因为今年抽调在职干部入高等学校学习的名额，已由中央高等教育部分配，由各单位根据具体情况统一调配，读者可直接向所属领导机关具体了解；对报刊发行工作中混乱现象提出意见的来信，五月九日本报第三版发表的以“进一步做好报刊的计划发行工作”为题的“读者来信述评”中已经综述了读者反映的情况，并提出了解决意见，邮电部、出版总署也已采取有效办法来改进上述现象。以上来信，我们不再作个别答复。
    最后，有一些读者来信因没有写清真实姓名和详细通讯处，致使我们难于答复，希望今后来信的读者务必写明真实姓名和详细通讯处；凡不愿意暴露其姓名和通讯处者，我们一定负责保守秘密。
