Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th - A correspondent from the Korean Central News Agency reported from Kaesong on the 11th: The returned sick and wounded soldiers of the Korean People's Army at the Kaesong Fifth Hospital are living happily and their health is steadily recovering. The pale faces of the sick and wounded soldiers from a few days ago are now beginning to regain their color. In the hospital's spacious sports ground, under the warm May sunshine, they sit in circles with the nurses in white coats, singing to their hearts' content under the willow trees, sometimes asking the nurses to tell them about current events and stories. In each clean ward, people are studying or playing cards and chess.

In Ward 9, a wounded soldier named Kim Teuk-ki had his eyes damaged by enemy gas bombs. On April 28th, he could only make out the masthead of the "Labor News" newspaper, but now he can see the four-point type in the newspaper very clearly. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung for their care, and praised the hospital's excellent equipment and technology, as well as the medical staff's exceptionally kind treatment. He said: "Soon, I will be able to pick up a pen and write a letter of thanks to Marshal Kim Il-sung like everyone else. This will be the first time I've written a letter in two years."

The people of the Kaesong area and various famous Korean art troupes are constantly coming to the hospital to comfort the sick and wounded soldiers. Members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's cultural troupe also gave them a wonderful performance of consolation in the square.

The health of the sick and wounded is rapidly recovering. According to Park Cheol, the director of the Fifth Hospital, the body temperatures of the seventy-three seriously ill patients in the hospital have returned to normal within a week; and one hundred and seventy-two of the four hundred and two mildly ill patients are about to fully recover.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th - According to the Korean Central News Agency, a portion of the returned sick and wounded prisoners of the Korean People's Army have recently arrived in a certain rear area in Korea. They were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life and social organizations in the area. Women gave them many gifts. In a solemnly decorated club, members of a junior middle school's Young Pioneer detachment gave them a performance of consolation. These sick and wounded personnel had all suffered persecution and torture at the hands of the Americans. They recounted to their relatives the painful persecution they suffered in the enemy prisoner-of-war camps, and expressed their deep concern for the fate of their comrades still in enemy hands. The warm welcome from the people in the Korean rear area filled them with infinite joy and encouragement.

They unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the people of the motherland for their kind care, and expressed their determination to dedicate all their strength to the construction of the motherland in the future.

    被遣返的朝人民军病伤人员健康日见恢复
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜中央通讯社记者十一日自开城报道：开城第五号病院里的朝鲜人民军被遣返的病伤人员生活愉快、健康日见恢复。病伤人员几天以前的苍白脸孔，现在都开始有了血色。在病院宽敞的运动场上，在五月温暖的阳光下，他们和白衣护士们一起并坐成圆圈，在杨柳树下尽情歌唱，有时让护士们给他们讲时事和故事。在每个洁净的病室里都有人在学习或打扑克、下象棋。
    九号病室有个伤员金慝基，被敌人的毒气弹损坏了眼睛。在四月二十八日，他只能看清“劳动新闻”报的报头，现在他看报纸上的四号字也能够看得很清楚了。他表示衷心地感激朝鲜劳动党与共和国政府和领袖金日成元帅对他们的关怀，并赞扬病院里设备、技术的良好和医务工作者对他们无比亲切的照顾。他说：不久以后，我就能提起笔来和别人一样地给金日成元帅写感谢信了。这将是我两年来的第一次写信。
    开城地区的人民和朝鲜各著名艺术团体，不断地到病院里来慰问病伤人员。中国人民志愿军的文工团团员们，也在广场上热情地给他们作了精采的慰问演出。
    病伤人员的健康都在迅速恢复中。据第五号病院院长朴哲说，该病院的七十三个重患者，在一个星期中体温都已恢复正常；四百零二个轻患者中有一百七十二人即将完全恢复健康。
    【新华社平壤十三日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：返回祖国的朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员，一部分最近已到达朝鲜后方某地。他们受到了当地各界人民和社会团体的热烈慰问。妇女们送给他们很多礼物。在布置得庄严美丽的俱乐部里，某初级中学校的少年团团员们为他们作了慰问演出。这些病伤人员都曾遭受过美方的迫害和摧残。他们向亲人们叙述了他们在敌方战俘营中受到的痛苦迫害，并且深切地关心着那些还在敌人手中的同志们的命运。朝鲜后方人民的热情慰问使他们感到无限的欣喜与鼓舞。
    他们对朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府、领袖金日成元帅和祖国人民对于他们的亲切关怀，一致表示感谢，并表示决心在今后为祖国的建设事业献出一切力量。
