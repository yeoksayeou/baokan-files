Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch: According to the Khmer News Agency, from December 1952 to March 1953, the Khmer Liberation Army engaged in thirty battles of varying sizes, eliminating more than 560 French invading soldiers, including one colonel, one major, and one puppet provincial governor and one puppet county magistrate each. The Khmer Liberation Army seized two mortars, sixteen heavy machine guns, one hundred and five rifles, sixteen trucks, and seventeen thousand rounds of ammunition; destroyed six vehicles, including one armored vehicle.

In addition, the militia and guerrillas in the villages also crushed many French army "sweeps" and launched many small-scale attacks on the French army, causing losses to the French army. On April 3, the Khmer local forces crushed a French army "sweep" in the An Xia area, killing or wounding 50 French soldiers, including four lieutenants.

The victories of the Khmer Liberation Army have caused widespread demoralization among the Khmer puppet troops. In April, many puppet troops deserted with their weapons to join the resistance. In Su'ai Die county, five puppet soldiers defected to the resistance, bringing with them one machine gun, two submachine guns, and many grenades and ammunition. In the Bangqingyang area, eleven puppet soldiers also defected to the liberated area with eleven rifles and many grenades.

    高棉解放军游击队频繁出击杀伤许多法军
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社引高棉通讯社报道：从一九五二年十二月到一九五三年三月的期间，高棉解放军进行了三十次大小的战斗，歼灭法国侵略军五百六十人以上，包括上校一名、少校一名和伪省长、伪县长各一名。高棉解放军缴获迫击炮二门、重机枪十六挺、步枪一百零五支、卡车十六辆和子弹一万七千发；击毁汽车六辆，其中有一辆装甲车。
    此外，在乡村里的民兵和游击队也粉碎了法军的多次“扫荡”，并向法军发动多次的小规模进攻，使法军遭到损失。四月三日，高棉地方部队在安夏地区粉碎法军的“扫荡”，杀伤法军五十人，其中有尉级四名军官。
    高棉解放军的胜利使高棉伪军的士气普遍低落，在四月份，有许多伪军携械参加抗战队伍。苏埃碟县有五名伪军投向抗战队伍，随身带有一挺机枪、二支冲锋枪和许多手榴弹和弹药。磅清扬地区也有十一名伪军带着十一支步枪和许多手榴弹投到解放区。
