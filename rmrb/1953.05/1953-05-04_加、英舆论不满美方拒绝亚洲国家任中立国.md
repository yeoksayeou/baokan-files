Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 3rd: The US side's rejection of an Asian country to serve as the neutral nation to take custody of prisoners of war not directly repatriated in its territory, and its publicity of this rejection in the news, has aroused great dissatisfaction among Canadian and British public opinion.

    On April 30th, in the Canadian House of Commons, Caldwell of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation questioned Foreign Minister Pearson about the US's unreasonable attitude. Pearson said in response that Canada did not support the US's position.

    British newspapers have also criticized Harrison's attitude. The Manchester Guardian commented on May 1st that Harrison "has only himself to blame" for the "commotion" caused by his refusal to allow Asian countries to serve as neutral nations. The newspaper said, "General Harrison's statement yesterday on the North Korean prisoner-of-war issue was unpleasant." The Manchester Guardian believes that all of Harrison's statements have been very clumsy.

    In order to ward off global condemnation, the US State Department hastily issued a statement using the US news agencies as a shield, saying that the US attitude towards the issue of Asian countries serving as neutral nations was "misunderstood" by news reports. However, this kind of defense cannot erase Harrison's insulting remarks towards Asian countries from the negotiation records.

    加、英舆论不满美方拒绝亚洲国家任中立国
    【新华社开城三日电】美方拒绝以一个亚洲国家担任在该国领土上收管未予直接遣返的战俘的中立国，并在新闻上加以宣传。这已经引起加拿大和英国舆论的极大不满。
    四月三十日，在加拿大议会下院中，合作联盟的柯尔德威尔就美方这种无理态度向外交部长皮尔逊提出责问，皮尔逊在回答时说，加拿大不支持美国的这种立场。
    英国报纸也纷纷抨击哈利逊的态度。“曼彻斯特卫报”在五月一日发表评论说，对于因哈利逊拒绝以亚洲国家充当中立国而引起的“纷扰”，哈利逊“只应该怪他自己。在以往四天中，他显得太蛮横了”。该报说，“哈利逊将军昨天对于北朝鲜战俘问题的发言是令人不愉快的。”“曼彻斯特卫报”认为，哈利逊所发表的一切声明都是非常笨拙的。
    为了招架全世界的谴责，美国国务院慌忙发表了一个声明，把美国通讯社拿来当作挡箭牌，说美方对于由亚洲国家担任中立国问题所抱的态度是被新闻报道“误解了”。可是这种辩解丝毫不能从谈判记录上抹去哈利逊侮辱亚洲国家的言论。
