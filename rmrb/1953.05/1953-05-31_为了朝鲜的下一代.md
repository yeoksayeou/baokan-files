This was an ordinary night in wartime Korea. On the evening of January 31st this year, eight American planes dropped more than two hundred incendiary and fragmentation bombs on a peaceful village near Pyongyang—Jiangjin-ri. The village immediately burst into flames. The fire burned more and more fiercely, the flames and thick smoke soared into the sky…

At this time, Liang Zhenhe, a medical orderly from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who lived in a village near Jiangjin-ri, was a 21-year-old young man. Carrying a Red Cross medical kit, he braved enemy air raids and rushed to Jiangjin-ri as fast as he could. As soon as he reached the edge of the village, he heard the cries of children nearby. Listening carefully, the cries came from a thatched house in front. The surrounding area of this thatched house was already on fire, and long tongues of flame were spewing out from the windows. The roof beams were burning and making sounds as if they were about to break. It looked like the house was about to collapse. But listening to the children's miserable cries, a noble sense of internationalism made him completely forget the danger to himself. He pulled his cotton cap down and rushed into the thick smoke and flames. Following the sound of crying, he groped to a corner of the wall and finally found the Korean child. Most of the quilt next to the child had already been burned away, and flames were reaching out viciously towards the child. Liang Zhenhe quickly picked up the child and ran out of the house. As soon as he reached the outside, "crash!" the house collapsed. Liang Zhenhe extinguished the flames on the child and himself, and quickly bandaged the child's wounds. At this time, the chairman of the village committee was also leading people to rescue the victims. So, Liang Zhenhe carried the child to the open space on the edge of the village, handed him over to them to take care of, and turned around to go back to the village to rescue more people.

Liang Zhenhe had just run to the side of a burned-down house when, in the moonlight and firelight, he suddenly saw a mother and a little girl lying on the snow beside the house. The mother's chest had been pierced, and fresh blood was gushing out. Half of her white clothes were stained red. Because of the severity of her injuries, she had already stopped breathing. The little girl, who looked about three or four years old, had her right leg blown off. She was crawling on her mother's corpse and crying loudly. Liang Zhenhe immediately rescued the little girl. At that moment, he discovered that in the mother's arms, there was also an infant who appeared to be less than two months old. The infant was wrapped in a small cotton quilt, its little eyes tightly closed, and half of its body was soaked in its mother's blood. Liang Zhenhe quickly felt the child's chest. Ah, the heart was still beating! Liang Zhenhe breathed a sigh of relief. He quickly and carefully unwrapped the infant from the mother's body, wrapped it in his arms, and ran as fast as he could to a bomb shelter, gently placing it on the warm floor. Then he returned and rescued the little girl whose leg had been blown off to outside the village.

About an hour later, the Pyongyang stretcher team and ambulance also arrived. Liang Zhenhe helped the medical personnel continue the rescue work, carrying the injured one by one onto the stretchers and sending them to the ambulance.

Before dawn, the rescue work was just completed, and Liang Zhenhe immediately ran to the bomb shelter. He saw the infant on the warm floor, its little eyes already open, moving its body around, opening its mouth and crying "waa, waa." The fatigue of the night's rescue was completely dispelled by this revived little life. Liang Zhenhe felt a rare excitement, and wrapped the baby up again, carefully carrying it back to his station.

The news spread in the village. The Korean villagers gathered around to see: Whose child is this? No one could recognize him. Liang Zhenhe decided to find the child's father. He thought: This child should not lose his father again. So, he ran back to the village that was attacked last night and, with the help of the village committee, finally found the infant's father. The infant's father was named Zhang Guandou, a kind Korean man. In the extreme grief after his family was destroyed by American planes, he suddenly heard that someone had saved his child. He simply couldn't believe it. Just as he was hesitating, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was already standing in front of him, holding an infant in his arms. The infant was still looking at him with its little eyes! He looked closely, it was his little baby—Zhang Xinzhi! He took the infant with one hand and held Liang Zhenhe's hand tightly with the other, tears welling up in his eyes, his lips trembling, so excited that he couldn't speak for a long time. After a while, he asked to write down Liang Zhenhe's name and mailing address, saying, "I will never forget this Volunteer Army comrade who saved my child!"

That day, Liang Zhenhe also wrote a letter to this infant, which he gave to his father to keep, so that he could read it when he grew up. This letter expressed the hatred of an ordinary soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the American aggressors, and his love and hope for the next generation of Korea. The letter read:

“Dearest Korean Little Brother:
On the evening of January 31, 1953, American aerial bandits bombed the peaceful residents of Jiangjin-ri, Pyongyang, Korea. At that time, your sister had one leg blown off, your mother was killed, and you were still sleeping in your mother’s arms. When I saw it, I felt that your mother was just like my mother, and you were like my own little brother. I picked you up and gave you to your father. When you grow up, you must remember: how the American devils killed your mother and how they killed the Korean people! You must avenge them, and you must serve your motherland well!

Chinese People's Volunteer Army
Medical Orderly Liang Zhenhe
February 1, 1953"

Zhang Xinzhi, this child who had experienced such suffering less than two months after his birth, was safely sent to the Pyongyang Nursery Home for nurturing three days later. In the peaceful days to come, when he grows up and sees this passionate letter, he will never forget the Chinese uncle who snatched his life back from the American aerial bandits. And not only Zhang Xinzhi, but more Korean children will remember the name of this Chinese uncle, because he also saved their fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters.

Recently, the leadership of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army where Liang Zhenhe was stationed issued a commendation order to its subordinate units, which stated: "... Comrade Liang Zhenhe's resourceful and courageous rescue of twenty-seven Korean villagers fully demonstrates the noble qualities and high internationalist spirit of our army, thereby enhancing the reputation of our army and strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people..."

Zhang Guandou said: "I will never forget this Volunteer Army comrade who saved my child!"

    为了朝鲜的下一代
    何松
    这是战时朝鲜的一个普通的夜晚。今年一月三十一日晚上，八架美国飞机向平壤附近的一个和平村庄——蒋金里投下了两百多颗燃烧弹和杀伤弹。村庄立刻燃起了熊熊的大火。火势越烧越猛，烈焰和浓烟直冲向天空……
    这时住在蒋金里附近村庄里的志愿军某部卫生员梁振和，是一个二十一岁的小伙子，他背着红十字药包，冒着敌机的袭击，三步并做两步地向蒋金里赶来。一到村边，他就听到附近有孩子的哭叫声，仔细一听，哭声是从前面一间茅屋里传出来的，这间茅屋周围已经全烧着了，窗户里吐出长长的火舌，屋梁烧得发出将要折裂的响声，眼看屋子就要塌下来了。但是听着孩子凄惨的哭声，一种崇高的国际主义的感情，使他根本忘掉了自身的危险，只见他把棉帽往下一拉，“呼”地一下就冲进浓烟烈焰中去了。顺着哭声，他摸到一个墙角，终于摸到了这个朝鲜孩子；孩子身边的棉被已经被烧去了大半截，火苗正向孩子凶恶地伸来。梁振和连忙一把将孩子抱起，转身奔出了屋子，刚到屋外，“哗啦”一声，那间屋子就塌了下来。梁振和扑灭了孩子和自己身上燃着的火苗，迅速地给孩子包扎了伤口。这时候，里委员长也正带着人抢救灾民，于是，梁振和就把孩子抱到村边的空地上，交给他们看护，自己转身又跑进村里救护去了。
    梁振和刚跑到一座烧毁的房屋旁边，在月色和火光里，蓦地看到屋旁雪地上躺着一个母亲和一个小女孩。母亲胸部被打穿了，鲜血直往外喷涌，白衣服被染红了半截；因为伤势过重，呼吸已经停止了。小女孩看去大约有三、四岁，右腿已被炸断，爬在母亲的尸身上大声地哭叫着，梁振和立刻救护了这个小女孩。就在这时候，他又发现这位母亲的怀里，还躺着一个看来不足两个月的婴孩。婴孩裹着一块小棉被，两只小眼睛紧紧闭着，半边身子浸在母亲的血泊里。梁振和赶快摸摸孩子的胸口，嗳，心脏还跳，梁振和这才松了一口气。他赶快把婴孩从这位母亲的身上小心地解下来，裹到自己的怀里，飞跑着把这个婴孩送到了一个防空哨所里去，轻轻地放在暖炕上。回头来，又把那个被炸断腿的小女孩救到村外。
    大约过了一个多钟头，平壤的担架队和救护车也赶来了。梁振和帮助医务人员继续进行救护工作，把受伤的一个个地抬上了担架，送上了救护车。
    天亮之前，救护工作刚刚完毕，梁振和立刻跑到防空哨所去。看到暖炕上的婴孩，已经睁开了小眼睛，身子动来动去的，张着嘴“哇哇”地哭着，一夜抢救的疲劳，被这个复活了的小生命完全驱散了。梁振和感到稀有的兴奋，又把这个婴儿裹起，小心地抱回了自己的驻地。
    事情在村子里传开了。朝鲜老乡们都聚拢来看：这是谁家的孩子呢？谁也认不出来。梁振和决心去找这孩子的父亲。他想：这孩子是不应该再失去父亲的。于是，他又跑到昨晚被难的那个村庄去，在里委员会的帮助下，终于找到了这个婴孩的父亲。这个婴孩的父亲叫张官斗，是个善良的朝鲜人，在被美国飞机炸得家破人亡以后的极度悲痛中，忽然听说有人救了他的孩子，他简直不能相信，正在犹疑之际，一个中国人民志愿军的战士已经站在他的面前，怀里抱着一个婴孩，婴孩还在张着小眼睛向他望呢！他定睛一看，正是他的小宝宝——张新植，他用一只手把婴孩接了过来，用另一只手紧紧地握着梁振和的手，噙着泪花，颤动着嘴唇，好半天激动得说不出话来。过了一会，他才要求一定要把梁振和的名字和通讯地址记下来，他说：“我永远也不会忘记这位救了我孩子的志愿军同志！”
    这一天，梁振和还给这个婴孩写了一封信，交给他的父亲保存起来，等他将来长大了再看。这封信表达了中国人民志愿军的一个普通战士对美国侵略者的憎恨，和对朝鲜下一代的爱护和希望。信里这样写着：
    “最亲爱的朝鲜小弟弟：
    在一九五三年一月三十一日晚上，美国空中强
    盗轰炸朝鲜平壤蒋金里的和平居民。当时，你
    的姐姐被炸断了一条
    腿，你的母亲被炸死了，
    你还睡在母亲的怀里
    呢。我看见了，觉得你
    的母亲就和我的母亲一
    样，你就像是我的亲弟
    弟。我把你抱起来，并
    且把你送给你的父亲。
    将来你长大了，你要记
    得：美国鬼子是怎样杀
    死你的母亲，怎样杀害
    朝鲜人民的！你要为他
    们报仇，你要为你的祖
    国好好服务！
    中国人民志愿军
    卫生员梁振和
    一九五三年二月一日”
    张新植，这个生下来还不到两个月，就经历了这样的苦难的孩子，过了三天后，就被安全地送到平壤幼儿院里去抚养了。在将来的和平的日子里，他长大了，看到了这封充满热情的信，他是永远也不会忘记这位把他的生命从美国空中强盗手中夺回来的中国叔叔的。而且不仅仅是张新植一个，还有更多的朝鲜孩子，都会记起这位中国叔叔的名字，因为他也救了他们的父亲、母亲、哥哥和姐姐们。
    最近，梁振和所在的志愿军某部领导机关，向所属单位发出了一个嘉奖令，里面说：“……梁振和同志机智勇敢地先后抢救二十七个朝鲜老乡的事迹，充分发扬了我军的高贵品质和高度的国际主义精神，从而提高了我军的声誉，加强了中朝人民的友谊……。”（附图片）
