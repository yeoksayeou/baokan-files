Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 13th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at the request of the Vietnam Youth League and the Vietnam Women's Federation, released 153 French prisoners of war in April to celebrate the International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights. Before leaving the Vietnamese liberated areas, the released prisoners of war jointly wrote letters to President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Youth League, and the Vietnam Women's Federation, expressing their gratitude for the leniency of the Vietnamese people and government.

In their letter of thanks to President Ho Chi Minh, they said: We were captured during the Northwest Campaign last year. We have been treated leniently by the Vietnamese army and people. We have come to understand the sinful and unjust nature of this war of aggression, the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese government's policy of leniency towards prisoners. We deeply regret our past mistakes. We are aware of our responsibilities and are determined to fight firmly for peace in Vietnam and demand the withdrawal of French troops.

This group of released prisoners of war also issued an appeal to French officers and soldiers, calling on them to unite, refuse to fight, demand immediate repatriation, and unite with soldiers from colonial countries to fight for an end to this "dirty war."

     越南政府又释放一批法军战俘
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社北越十三日讯：越南民主共和国政府应越南青年联盟和越南妇女联合会的请求，在四月份释放了一百五十三名法军战俘，以庆祝国际保卫青年权利会议。被释放的战俘在离开越南解放区以前曾联名写信给胡志明主席、越南青年联盟和越南妇女联合会，对越南人民和政府的宽待表示感谢。
    他们在给胡志明主席的感谢信中说：我们是在去年西北战役中被俘的。我们受到越南军队和人民的宽待。我们了解到这个侵略战争的罪恶和不正义的性质、越南人民的英勇的抗战和越南政府的宽待俘虏的政策。我们对我们过去的错误深深地感到悔恨。我们自觉到自己的责任，决心要坚定地为争取越南的和平、要求撤退法军而斗争。
    这批被释放的战俘同时发表告法军军官和士兵的呼吁书，要求他们团结一致，拒绝作战，要求立即回国，并联合从殖民地国家来的士兵为结束这个“肮脏的战争”而奋斗。
