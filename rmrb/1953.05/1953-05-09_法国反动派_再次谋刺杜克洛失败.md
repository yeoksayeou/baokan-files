Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 7th: TASS reports from Paris on the 6th: "L'Humanité" reported another attempt to assassinate Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party.

A man who identified himself as Gaston Brun arrived at Duclos' office in Montreuil, a working-class suburb of Paris, on the evening of the 5th, demanding an immediate meeting with Duclos. Duclos was not present at the time, and his secretary received him. The man then pulled out a loaded pistol from his pocket and threatened Duclos' secretary. However, the secretary managed to leave the reception room and call the police. Later, the Montreuil police station confirmed that the terrorist's real name was Lucien Legaux.

"L'Humanité" pointed out that before going to the Montreuil Town Hall, Legaux had also gone to Duclos' home to look for him. "L'Humanité" said that this was another attempt to assassinate the Secretary of the French Communist Party, which shows the results of the evil anti-communist movement. "L'Humanité" pointed out that the first attempt to assassinate Duclos was in October 1950, when Duclos was giving a speech at a rally in Vauzelles, Cher.

    再次谋刺杜克洛失败
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：“人道报”报道了又一次谋刺法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛的事件。
    一个自称为加斯东·布朗的人，在五日傍晚到巴黎近郊工人区蒙特勒伊杜克洛办公处，要求立即会见杜克洛。当时杜克洛不在，由他的秘书接见。这个人就从口袋里掏出实弹手枪来，威胁杜克洛的秘书。但是这个秘书幸运地离开了会客室，把警察叫来。后来，蒙特勒伊警察局证实这个恐怖分子的真实姓名是吕西安·利果。
    “人道报”指出：利果到蒙特勒伊市政厅以前，还到过杜克洛的家里去找杜克洛。“人道报”说：这是又一次企图暗杀法国共产党的书记，从这里可以看出罪恶的反共运动的结果。“人道报”指出：第一次谋杀杜克洛是在一九五零年十月，那时杜克洛正在席尔省沃煦城的一个集会上发表演说。
