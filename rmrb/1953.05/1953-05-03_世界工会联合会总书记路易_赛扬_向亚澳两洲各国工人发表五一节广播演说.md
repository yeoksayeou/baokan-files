World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Louis Saillant
Addresses Asian and Australian Workers on May Day via Radio

On this May Day of 1953, I am very pleased, on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to extend warm and fraternal greetings to the working men and women of Asia and Australia.

This year, we celebrate May Day with increased confidence in the growing strength of the international workers' movement. This movement has already played an active and decisive role in the global people's struggle for peace and democracy.

This year's celebration of May Day, the international labor day, will further strengthen the unity of workers of all nationalities, races, religions, and parties around the world.

I am inspired by the unwavering will of our great world workers' organization, and in the name of the World Federation of Trade Unions, I extend to you fraternal greetings. This will is to unite the masses of the people more closely, and to unite closely with them to struggle for common and vital interests.

On May Day, we call on all workers to strive to strengthen unity, because the united action of the working class is an indispensable condition for striving for a better life, democratic freedom, national independence, and defending peace.

We call on workers of all countries to unite. The unity of workers in Asian and Australian countries within their own countries will raise the level of struggle of Asian and Australian workers and win new victories. The World Federation of Trade Unions once again calls on workers in Asia and Australia to unite, to oppose any policies that undermine friendship between the peoples of Asia and Australia. Strengthening and consolidating this friendship can consolidate peace and shatter war-provoking policies.

While calling on all workers around the world to take united action under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions, we fervently hope that friendship between people of different nationalities, races, and parties can be successfully established.

As we celebrate May Day in Beijing, we are once again demonstrating the power of the World Federation of Trade Unions' solidarity. The World Federation of Trade Unions delegation and national delegations invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to China are very pleased to see the tremendous progress of the Chinese people in peaceful construction.

People's China is carrying out great construction. Inspired by the glorious example and experience of the Soviet people, and encouraged by their creative labor, the Chinese people are ensuring the continuous growth of the national economy and fully developing democratic rights, thereby making such a large country an unshakable fortress for the great cause of peace for all peoples.

You, the people of Asia, like the people of other continents, have welcomed the peace initiatives made by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which laid the foundation for stopping hostilities in Korea and peacefully resolving the entire Korean issue.

Facts have once again proven that no international dispute cannot be resolved through consultation and cooperation. Facts have also proven that the people who are responsible for defending the cause of peace must know how to defend peace to the end.

At this moment, which may be of the utmost importance to the fate of our generation and our descendants, the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all workers in Asia and other continents to make the greatest efforts, by all possible means, to strive for a "ceasefire in Korea" and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The World Federation of Trade Unions represents the will of the workers of all countries and believes that the United Nations' recent debates on the Korean issue make it necessary for the United Nations to now take truly effective measures to establish peace in Korea. Only by following this path can the United Nations Organization become a peaceful tool for serving the people. In this way, it can fulfill the tasks it undertook when it was established in 1945.

The initiative of the great Government of the People's Republic of China has further heightened the universal desire for peace among the people of the world, and the United Nations must, in accordance with this desire, unhesitatingly allow the representatives of China to participate in the United Nations to strengthen its prestige among the peoples of all countries.

This legitimate demand of the people of all countries is concretely expressed in their urgent demand for an international conference of the governments of the five major powers: the Soviet Union, the United States, China, Britain, and France, in order to jointly conclude a peace treaty.

In all countries, whether in Europe, Africa, America, Australia, or Asia, the masses of the people are daily issuing a powerful call for a "ceasefire." Let us rise up and make common efforts to make 1953 a year that clearly separates the years of war and bloodshed from the years of peaceful development and strengthened friendly cooperation among the people.

The peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems is the basis for enabling people to immediately realize the cause of peace.

May this year's May Day be a day for strengthening friendship between the people of all countries, and may May Day bring new impetus to those who are fighting for national independence.

May this May Day of 1953 help the working class to unite more closely with peasants, intellectuals, and other patriotic elements in all countries who are determined to defend national independence and democratic rights from the threats and aggressions of imperialism.

May this May Day of 1953 also be the starting point for new united actions by workers fighting to improve living conditions, win new social laws, and consolidate and expand democratic rights.

On this May Day of 1953, let us struggle against those who attempt to maintain divisions within the ranks of the working class and trade union organizations, and expose their faces.

Long live May Day, the great festival of the unity of workers of all countries!

Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, the resolute defender of the interests of workers of all countries united under the invincible banner of proletarian internationalism!

### 世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬  向亚澳两洲各国工人发表五一节广播演说

    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬
    向亚澳两洲各国工人发表五一节广播演说
    在一九五三年的“五一”节，我很高兴地以世界工会联合会的名义向亚洲和澳洲各国男女工人致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    今年，我们怀着国际工人运动力量日益增强的信心来庆祝“五一”节。这个运动已经在全世界人民为争取和平和民主的斗争中起了积极的决定性的作用。
    今年庆祝“五一”国际劳动节将进一步加强不同国籍、种族、宗教、党派的世界各国工人的团结。
    我为我们世界工人伟大组织的不可动摇的意志所鼓舞，以世界工联的名义向你们致以兄弟般的祝贺，这个意志就是要更紧密地团结人民群众，和他们紧密地联合起来为共同的切身的利益而斗争。
    在“五一”节，我们号召所有工人努力加强统一，因为工人阶级的统一行动是争取美好生活、民主自由、民族独立和保卫和平的必不可少的条件。
    我们号召各国工人团结起来。亚澳各国工人在自己国家内的团结，将提高亚洲及澳洲工人的斗争水平并赢得新的胜利。世界工联再一次号召亚澳各国工人团结起来，反对任何破坏亚澳各国人民之间友谊的政策，加强并且巩固这种友谊就能够巩固和平、粉碎战争挑拨政策。
    在号召全世界工人在世界工联旗帜下统一行动的时候，我们热望不同国籍、种族、党派的各国人民之间的友谊能够胜利地建立起来。
    当我们在北京庆祝“五一”节的时候，我们再一次显示了世界工联团结的力量。应中华全国总工会邀请前来中国的世界工联代表团和各国代表团十分愉快地看到中国人民在和平建设中的巨大的进步。
    人民中国正在进行着伟大的建设。中国人民为苏联人民的光荣的榜样和经验所鼓舞，为苏联人民的创造性劳动所鼓舞，确保了国家经济的不断增长并充分发扬了民主权利，从而使这样一个大国成为各国人民伟大的和平事业的不可动摇的堡垒。
    你们亚洲各国的人民，正如其他洲的各国人民一样，对中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所作的和平倡议表示了欢迎，这个和平倡议为停止朝鲜的敌对行动、和平解决整个朝鲜问题奠定了基础。
    事实再一次证明，没有任何国际纠纷是不能用协商与合作的办法解决的。事实并且证明，担负起保卫和平事业的人民必须知道应该如何把和平保卫到底。
    在这个也许对我们这一代和我们后代的命运具有最重要意义的时机，世界工联号召所有亚洲和其他洲的工人们尽最大的努力，以一切可能的办法来争取“在朝鲜停火”和朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    世界工联代表各国工人的意志，认为联合国最近在朝鲜问题上的辩论使联合国现在有必要采取真正有效的措施在朝鲜建立和平。只有遵循这条道路，联合国组织才能成为为人民服务的和平工具。这样，它才能完成它在一九四五年成立的时候所担当起来的任务。
    伟大的中华人民共和国政府的倡议使全世界人民对和平的普遍愿望更加高涨了，联合国必须依照这种愿望毫不延迟地使中国的代表参加联合国，来加强自己在各国人民中间的威信。
    各国人民的这一正当要求具体表现在他们迫切要求举行苏联、美国、中国、英国和法国五大国政府的国际会议上面，以便共同缔结和平公约。
    在所有国家，不管是欧洲、非洲、美洲、澳洲，或是亚洲的国家，人民群众每天都在发出要求“停火”的强大呼声。让我们起来作共同的努力，使一九五三年成为把战火、流血的年代与人民的和平发展、友好合作加强的年代清楚划分开来的一年。
    社会制度不同的各国的和平共处是使人们能够立即实现和平事业的基础。
    愿今年的“五一”节成为各国人民之间的友谊加强的日子，愿五一节给为民族独立而斗争的人们带来新的推动力。
    愿一九五三年的“五一”节帮助工人阶级更紧密地和决心保卫民族独立和民主权利，使之不受帝国主义的威胁和侵犯的各国农民、知识分子和其他爱国分子团结起来。
    愿这个一九五三年的“五一”节同时成为为改善生活条件、赢得新的社会法律、巩固和扩大民主权利而斗争的工人们的新的统一行动的起点。
    一九五三年的“五一”节，让我们和那些企图在工人阶级队伍和工会组织中保持分裂的人展开斗争并揭露他们的面目。
    各国工人团结的伟大节日——五一节万岁！
    在不可战胜的无产阶级国际主义旗帜下团结起来的各国工人利益的坚决保卫者——世界工会联合会万岁！　（新华社）
