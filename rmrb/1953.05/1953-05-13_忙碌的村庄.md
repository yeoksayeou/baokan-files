    Busy Village
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
    "Five Many's"
    In many villages in Quwo County, Shanxi Province, when cadres and activists talk about their work, they all say that there are many work tasks, many official documents with instructions and forms, many meetings and training sessions, many organizational structures, and many concurrent positions held by cadres. These "five many's" are really overwhelming.
    One evening, the village cadres of Tingcheng Village in Quwo County talked to me about their many work tasks. They counted on their fingers and said: there are more than ten kinds of tasks every month, and these tasks are often assigned without regard to their urgency. They talked about the situation in August of last year, which best represents this situation: At the beginning, the county sent a work team to establish base points for land survey and production assessment, and assigned the task of land survey and production assessment. While various departments in the village were drawing cadres to carry out this work, the provincial and prefectural agricultural bumper harvest "four appraisals and four comparisons" work teams came again; they assigned appraisal and comparison tasks. Various departments in the village continued to draw cadres to carry out this work, and tasks from various departments at higher levels were all pressed down: The business office of the district People's Bank sent people to establish credit cooperatives, requiring 100% of people over the age of sixteen to subscribe for shares; the district insurance company sent people to promote insurance work, requiring 100% of livestock to be insured; the cotton purchasing team of the county supply and marketing cooperative came to assign the task of cotton storage; the district department store team came to assign the task of promoting "patriotic felt"; the cadres of the county liquor monopoly distribution office came to assign the task of promoting "patriotic liquor"; the cadres of the district supply and marketing cooperative came to assign the task of promoting "patriotic mooncakes" and developing members; the district veterinary station sent people to establish veterinary substations; the cadres of the county health department came to establish midwifery stations; the cadres of the prefectural farm sent cadres to collect the accounts for cottonseeds; the cadres of the county cultural and educational center came to establish clubs. According to statistics, at that time, there were twelve work units coming to the village, with a total of seventy-three cadres, assigning fourteen kinds of tasks. Each unit said that its task was a "central task," a "shock task," or a "serious political task," and required the village head and branch secretary and other main cadres to guarantee its completion. The cadres were so busy that they could hardly breathe. Branch Secretary Zhang Dezheng and Village Head Sun Zixiu said: "Everyone is a superior, everything is central, we are so busy that we only sleep two or three hours a night."
    Accompanying these heavy tasks were countless official documents, forms, and written reports. According to statistics in March of this year, the party committee, the government, the Youth League, the supply and marketing cooperative, the People's Armed Forces Department, and the Democratic Women's Federation and other units sent seventy-five official documents (excluding propaganda materials and publications), and twenty-three types of thirty-two forms. The scope of the forms was very broad, in addition to statistics on production, literacy campaigns, finance and grain, credit, etc., there were also women's menstrual belt sales statistics forms, women's pregnancy, childbirth and infant mortality statistics forms, rat tail statistics forms (leaving tails after rat killing in order to count the number of rats killed), etc. There were nineteen types of thirty-nine written reports. Among them, the reports to the county included: reports on model deeds in implementing the Marriage Law, reports on model deeds in literacy campaigns, summary reports on the selection of models for literacy campaigns, monthly reports on culture and education, study summary reports, and production publicity summaries; the reports to the district included: health work reports, production situation reports, end-of-month production reports, summary reports on the implementation of the Marriage Law, reports on the loan work of credit cooperatives, etc.
    The organizational structure in the village is also huge. According to statistics, there are fixed organizational structures: Party Branch Committee, Youth League Branch Committee, Democratic Women's Federation, People's Representative Conference, Government Committee, and the eight major committees under the Government Committee: Finance and Grain, Culture and Education, Preferential Treatment, Production, Health, Public Security, and Armed Forces; in addition, there are Mediation, Water Conservancy, Literacy Campaign, Transfer to Construction (handling the production and living problems of demobilized soldiers), Implementation of the Marriage Law, Publicity of the Marriage Law, Afforestation, Production Technology, Livestock Health Care, Insurance, Midwifery, Militia Review, Club, School Construction, the Resist America, Aid Korea Committee, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch; in addition, there are credit cooperatives, statistics groups, tax groups, and distribution stations. A total of thirty-three organizational structures. There are temporary organizational structures: Land Survey and Production Assessment, Agricultural Bumper Harvest Appraisal and Comparison, Cotton Purchase and other four committees. Each organizational structure has at least three people, and at most seven or eight to more than ten people, with the most reaching one hundred and seventeen people (such as the Production Committee, with 15 members, 7 team leaders, 43 group leaders, 43 instructors, and 9 accountants and secretaries, etc.). All organizational structures need 487 cadres above the level of group leader. According to cadre statistics, the village has a population of 1,500 people. After deducting the old, young, disabled, and sick who cannot hold positions, there are about 500 people who can hold positions. In this way, almost everyone can be assigned a position. But in fact, only 230 people hold positions, and there is a shortage of more than half of the cadres.
    The solution to the shortage of cadres is to hold concurrent positions. The main cadres hold the most concurrent positions. Each of the branch secretary and village head holds as many as sixteen concurrent positions. Gao Furong, vice chairman of the Women's Federation, also holds thirteen concurrent positions. Youth League Branch Secretary Han Kerang, Party Branch Committee members Zhang Yueshun and Song Peifeng, and Armed Forces Captain Song Peicheng, etc., each hold more than ten concurrent positions.
    With cadres holding more concurrent positions, there are also more meetings and training sessions. According to statistics in March of this year, 130 cadres went to the province, prefecture, county, and district to attend meetings and training sessions. Each person went out for at least three to five days, and at most thirty to forty days. If each person goes out for an average of ten days, then 130 people go out for 1,300 days, which is equivalent to 43 people completely leaving production for a month. The main cadres spend the most time attending meetings and training sessions. Since mid-October last year, Gao Furong, vice chairman of the Women's Federation, according to incomplete statistics: participated in the propagandist representatives meeting convened by the prefectural committee for ten days, participated in the county labor model meeting for eleven days, the county people's representatives meeting for seven days, the county women's representatives meeting for six days, and the chicken-raising expert training class for three days, and another twenty-two to three days for visits and meetings; after the New Year, went to the county to participate in the people's representatives meeting on the implementation of the Marriage Law for four days, and the youth and women's meeting on the implementation of the Marriage Law for four days; after returning to the village, successively held meetings on the implementation of the Marriage Law, including meetings of the old men, bachelors, widows, wives, youth, women, and mass meetings. These meetings made Gao Furong dizzy. Last year, she successively participated in five or six meetings in the prefectural committee and county leading organs. When she returned to the village to convey the contents of the meetings, she forgot most of them, and could not even remember the names of some meetings. From mid-October last year to March of this year, she missed 87 days of work due to meetings. In addition, the main cadres such as the party branch secretary, village head, and youth league branch secretary all miss about ten days of work per month due to meetings.
    Coercive Orders and False Reports
    Since the work tasks of the cadres are so heavy, how do they carry out their work? Once, I asked a main cadre:
    "Are there so many tasks, can they be completed?"
    "They can be completed."
    "How to complete them?"
    "This...it's hard to say."
    The words "hard to say" reveal a very incorrect working method often adopted by some village cadres. Here is an example of Huang Yuangui's promotion of wheat insurance work.
    Huang Yuangui is an insurance committee member and also a mutual aid team leader. The insurance company wanted him to guarantee 100% insurance of wheat in his team, in order to promote the wheat insurance work in the whole village. He knew that this task was not easy to complete, because the insurance company stipulated that wheat should be insured according to 60% of the normal yield, and the masses believed that even in the worst years there would be such a harvest, and there was no need to spend money on insurance at all. The higher authorities forced insurance, which was equivalent to paying seven jin of wheat insurance premiums for every hundred jin of wheat for nothing. But Huang Yuangui was afraid of being criticized for failing to complete the task, and finally made all 110 mu of wheat in the team of more than ten households insured. I asked him how he completed this task. He said: "Now we can't force orders, of course it is mobilization." I said: "How to mobilize?" He said: "Take your time and convince him." He introduced the situation when he mobilized the father of Youth League Branch Secretary Han Kerang. At the beginning, the old man Han did not want to insure, he said it was a waste of money. Huang Yuangui talked to him about the principle of individual interests obeying national interests, but he still did not want to insure; then he talked to him about the comparison between the two societies, and told him not to forget his roots after he was freed, but he still did not want to insure; he mobilized for the eighth time, proposing that insurance was to support the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and to be patriotic; the old man Han had to say: "Okay, let's insure it." Huang Yuangui said: "As soon as I left his door, I heard him mutter to himself: 'Patriotism, patriotism, patriotism is not the way to love it.' Of course, his thinking is still not very clear, but since he agreed in person, that's it, how can we make his thinking clear!" I asked Huang Yuangui what he thought of wheat insurance. He said with a smile: "To be honest, where does wheat insurance need to be insured at 60% of the harvest? I don't understand this issue in my mind, but I am a leader, and I have to understand it even if I don't understand it."
    Sometimes, some cadres really can't complete the task, so they make false reports.
    In February and March of this year, the district instructed that the production situation should be reported every five days. In addition to the general production dynamics, the content of the report also included statistics on the agricultural activities of each household. The statistical items included the number of full and half labor force, the number of various livestock power, the sales volume of various fertilizers, the number of various accumulated fertilizers, the number of cotton fields plowed, turned over, and harrowed, the number of cotton seeds roughly selected, finely selected, turned over, dried, soaked, etc., the number of mutual aid teams rectified, etc. There were dozens of types in total. The village production committee assigned the task to seven mutual aid brigades, the brigade assigned the task to forty-eight mutual aid teams, and the team assigned the task to households. However, reporting every five days was too short, and often the materials for this time had not been collected, and the reporting time for the next time came again. Moreover, the masses worked hard all day and were unwilling to hold group meetings at night to report materials. In order to report on schedule, the production committee no longer assigned tasks level by level, but several cadres took over the task. A production committee member said: "In theory, it is necessary to count each household; but there are more than 300 households in the whole village, and a few of us can't make it in time to count even if we break our legs. There is no way, so we have to estimate."
    Spontaneous Production
    How can we carry out production if we are busy with these tasks all day long? I have talked to Zhang Dezheng (Party Branch Secretary), Han Kerang (Youth League Branch Secretary), Song Peifeng (Party Branch Committee Member), Yang Shaotang (Labor Model), etc. about this issue. They said: We also know that production work is important, but we are too busy to spare time to lead it. They said that one-third of the 48 mutual aid teams in the village are perfunctory because they have not been rectified, and some party members are still engaging in disguised employment. Under the influence of the blind and rash advance of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in other areas, the production enthusiasm of many mutual aid team members is very unstable. Some people have sold their livestock, some are unwilling to purchase farm tools, and some dare not buy more fertilizers...
    On April 5, the village office received a notice from the district on the arrangement of agricultural production in the second quarter, requiring the village to carry out the following work: plow cotton fields, send manure, select seeds, topdressing wheat, prevent diseases and insect pests, repair canals and dig wells, conserve water and soil, promote waterwheels, step plows, fertilizers, and agents in conjunction with material exchanges, afforestation, breeding and reproduction, formulate production plans, carry out production increase competitions, promote advanced experience and publicity campaigns to learn technology, and formulate a plan to rectify mutual aid and cooperation. After this notice reached the village office, the cadres had not yet seen it, and the village office secretary wrote it on the blackboard as it was, as if it had been assigned. The cadres said: "There are official matters every day, we are too busy to take care of them, let the secretary take care of them." Some of the masses reflected: "That's right, but it's not easy to handle. It's like topdressing wheat, can this help? Promoting advanced experience, what advanced experience is there? Asking to formulate production plans, how to formulate them?..."
            × × ×
    This "five many's" phenomenon is a very heavy burden on cadres and seriously affects the current production work. The emergence of this problem, of course, cannot be the responsibility of the district and village; and to solve this problem, it is necessary to eliminate the decentralism and bureaucracy of the leading organs at the county level and above, uniformly arrange and assign tasks, streamline official documents, arrange and control various meetings, streamline organizational structures, and promote bottom-up criticism and supervision.

    忙碌的村庄

    “五多”
    在山西省曲沃县的许多村庄里，和干部、积极分子谈起他们的工作情形时，他们都说，村里的工作任务多，公文指示表格多，开会受训多，组织机构多，干部兼职多。这“五多”，真是把人压得喘不过气来。
    一个晚上，曲沃县听城村的村干部和我谈起他们工作任务多的情形。他们数着指头说：每个月都有十多种任务，这些任务，时常是不分急缓地派下来的。他们谈到最能代表这种情况的去年八月份的情形：开始，县里来了查田定产基点工作团，布置了查田定产。村里各系统正在抽调干部进行这一工作，省和专区的农业丰产四评四比工作团又来了；它们布置了评比任务。村里各系统继续抽调干部进行这一工作，上级各系统的任务都压下来了：区人民银行营业所派人来成立信贷社，要求十六岁以上的人百分之百地入股；区保险公司派人来推广保险工作，要求牲口百分之百地保险；县供销合作社收购棉花组来布置存棉工作；区百货公司小组来布置推销“爱国毡”；县酒业专卖分销处的干部来布置推销“爱国酒”；区供销合作社的干部来布置推销“爱国月饼”和发展社员；区兽医站派人来成立兽医分站；县卫生科的干部来成立接产站；专区农场派干部来收棉花籽的账；县文教馆的干部来成立俱乐部。据统计，当时来到村的工作单位有十二个，共七十三个干部，布置了十四种任务。每个单位都说自己的任务是“中心任务”“突击任务”或“严重的政治任务”，要求村长和支部书记等主要干部保证完成。干部忙得喘不过气来。支部书记张德正、村长孙自修说：“人人是上级，事事是中心，忙得咱们一个晚上才睡两三个钟头的觉。”
    伴随着这些繁重的任务而来的是数不清的公文表格和书面报告。据今年三月份统计，党委、政府、青年团、供销合作社、人民武装部、民主妇联等单位发来的公文有七十五件（宣传品和刊物不在内），发来的表格有二十三种三十二份。表格的范围很广，除了生产、扫除文盲、财粮、信贷等方面的统计表，还有妇女月经带推销统计表，妇女妊娠、生育和婴儿死亡统计表，老鼠尾巴统计表（打鼠留下尾巴，以便统计打鼠数字）等。书面报告有十九种三十九份，这里面给县里报告的有：贯彻婚姻法模范事迹报告，扫除文盲模范事迹报告，评选扫除文盲模范总结报告，文教月报，学习小结报告，生产宣传总结；给区里报告的有：卫生工作报告，生产情况报告，月终生产报告，贯彻婚姻法总结报告，信贷社贷款工作情况报告等。
    村子里的组织机构也是庞大的。据统计，固定的组织机构有：党支部委员会，团支部委员会，民主妇联会，人民代表会，政府委员会，和属于政府委员会的财粮，文教，优抚，生产，卫生，治安，武装等八大委员会；此外还有调解，水利，扫除文盲，转业建设（处理复员军人的生产、生活问题），贯彻婚姻法，宣传婚姻法，植树造林，生产技术，牲畜保健、保险、接产，民兵审查，俱乐部，学校建设，抗美援朝委员会及中苏友好协会支会；另外还有信贷社，统计组，税务组，发行站。共计三十三个组织机构。临时的组织机构有：查田定产、农业丰产评比、棉花收购等四个委员会。每个组织机构少则三人，多则七、八人至十余人，最多的达到一百十七人（如生产委员会，有委员十五人，大队长七人，组长四十三人，指导员四十三人，会计、书记等九人）。全部组织机构需要组长以上的干部四百八十七人。据干部统计，该村人口一千五百人，除去老、小、残、病等人不能任职外，约有五百人可以任职，这样，几乎每个人都可以分到一个职务。但是实际上任职的只有二百三十人，还缺少干部半数以上。
    解决干部不足的办法是兼职。主要干部兼职最多。支部书记、村长每人兼职达十六种。妇联会副主席高芙蓉也有十三种兼职。青年团支部书记韩克让，党支部委员张月顺、宋佩封，武装队长宋佩成等，每人都兼职十种以上。
    干部兼职多了，开会受训也就多了。据今年三月份统计，干部到省、专区、县、区开会受训的有一百三十人，每人出去的时间少则三、五天，多则三、四十天，每人平均出去以十天计算，一百三十人就出去一千三百天，等于四十三个人完全脱离生产一个月。主要干部开会受训的时间最多。妇联会副主席高芙蓉从去年十月中旬以来，据不完全统计：参加地委召集的宣传员代表会十天，参加县劳动模范会十一天、县各界人民代表会七天、县妇女代表会六天、养鸡能手训练班三天，另外参观、开会二十二、三天；过了年，到县参加各界人民代表会贯彻婚姻法会议四天，青年、妇女会贯彻婚姻法会议四天；回村后，连续召开贯彻婚姻法会议，包括老汉会、光棍会、寡妇会、老婆会、青年会、女子会和群众大会。这些会议把高芙蓉弄得头昏脑胀。去年她在地委会和县的领导机关连续参加了五、六个会议，回村传达会议内容时，把一大半都忘了，有些会议的名字都想不起来了。她自去年十月中旬至今年三月，开会误工八十七天。此外党支部书记、村长、团支部书记等主要干部，每月开会都要误工十天左右。
    强迫命令和假报告
    干部的工作任务既然这样繁重，他们怎样进行工作呢？有一次，我向一个主要干部问道：
    “任务这样多，能够完成吗？”
    “能完成了。”
    “怎样完成？”
    “这……很难说。”
    “很难说”三个字，透露出部分村干部常常采用的一种极不正确的工作方法。这里举皇元贵推行小麦保险工作的情形作例子。
    皇元贵是保险委员，又是互助组长。保险公司要他保证本组的小麦百分之百的保险，以便推动全村的小麦保险工作。他知道这个任务不容易完成。因为保险公司规定小麦按六成年景保险，群众认为再不好的年景也有这样的收成，根本用不着花钱保险。上级强迫保险，等于每百斤麦子白出七斤麦子的保险费。但皇元贵害怕完不成任务受批评，到底使全组十多户的一百一十亩小麦都保险了。我问他怎样完成了这个任务，他说：“现在不能强迫命令，自然是动员的。”我说：“怎样动员呢？”他说：“慢慢的来，把他说住。”他介绍了动员青年团支部书记韩克让的父亲时候的情形。开始，韩老头不愿意保险，他说这是白花钱。皇元贵就给他谈个人利益服从国家利益的道理，他还是不愿意保险；又给他谈两个社会的对比，叫他翻身不要忘本，他还是不愿意保险；动员到第八次，提出保险是为了支援抗美援朝，为了爱国；韩老头只好说：“好吧，保险就保险吧。”皇元贵说：“我刚出了他的门口，就听他自言自语地说：‘爱国，爱国，爱国也不是这样爱法呀。’当然，他的思想还是不大通，但他既然当面答应了，也就算了，那还能让思想通透呢！”我问皇元贵对于小麦保险有什么看法。他笑着说：“说实在话，小麦保险百分之六十的收成，那里还用得着保险呢？我对这个问题思想上也是不大通的，可是我是个带头人，不通也得通呀。”
    有些干部有时候实在完不成任务，于是就作假报告。
    今年二三月间，区里指示，五天要汇报生产情况一次。汇报的内容，除了一般的生产动态，还有每户的农事活动统计。统计的项目，包括全、半劳动力数，各种畜力数，各种肥料推销数，各种积肥数，棉田的耙、翻、犁数，棉籽的粗选、精选、翻晒、浸泮数，互助组的整顿数，等等。共有几十种。村的生产委员会把任务布置到七个互助大队，大队布置到四十八个互助组，组布置到户。可是五天汇报一次，时间太短，常常是这次的材料还没有搜集，下次的汇报时间又来了。而且群众白天劳动一天，都不愿意在晚上开小组会汇报材料。生产委员会为了按期进行汇报，就不再把任务逐级布置下去，而由几个干部把任务包揽起来。一个生产委员说：“按道理说，是要逐户统计的；可是全村三百多户，咱们几个人跑断腿也来不及统计，没有办法，只好估计。”
    生产自流
    成天忙于这些工作，怎样进行生产呢？我曾经和张德正（党支部书记）、韩克让（团支部书记）、宋培封（党支部委员）杨绍堂（劳动模范）等谈到这个问题。他们说：咱们也知道生产工作重要，就是忙得抽不出时间来领导。他们说，村里全村四十八个互助组，因为没有整顿，有三分之一流于形式，有的党员还在变相雇工，在其他地区互助合作运动盲目冒进的影响下，许多互助组员生产情绪很不安定，有的人把牲口卖了，有的人不愿意购置农具，有的人不敢多买肥料……。
    四月五日，村公所接到区上关于第二季的农业生产安排的通知，要求村里进行下列的工作：犁棉花地，送粪，选种，小麦追粪，防止病虫害，修渠打井，水土保持，结合物资交流推广水车、步犁、肥料、药剂，植树造林，配种繁殖，制定生产计划，开展增产竞赛，推广先进经验和学习技术的宣传运动，制定整顿互助合作方案等。这个通知到达村公所后，干部还没有看见，村公所书记就照原文写在黑板报上，算是布置下去了。干部们说：“公事天天有，忙得顾不上看，让书记去办就行了。”有的群众反映说：“说的不错，就是不好办。好比小麦上追肥，这能顶事？推广先进经验，那有什么先进经验？要求制订生产计划，怎样制订呢？……”
            ×    ×    ×
    这种“五多”的现象，对干部是一个很沉重的负担，严重地影响到当前的生产工作。这个问题的产生，当然不能由区、村负责；而要解决这个问题，必须清除县以上各级领导机关的分散主义和官僚主义，统一安排和布置任务，精简公文，安排和节制各种会议，精简组织机构，提倡自下而上的批评和监督。
