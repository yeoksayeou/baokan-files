Editor's Note: The magistrate of Huang County, Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, has adopted a system of regularly receiving people's visits. This is a good way to strengthen the ties between the Party and the people's government and the masses. It allows the people's various hardships and disputes to be resolved in a timely manner, and enables the county's leading cadres to understand the situation and overcome bureaucracy, guiding their work in a more practical manner. However, ways to care for the people's well-being and strengthen ties with the masses should not be limited to this. Leading cadres should also educate other cadres to jointly establish a mass perspective and working methods based on the mass line, and establish permanent working organs and necessary working systems for receiving people's visits, so that this work can be carried out comprehensively and systematically.

The Huang County People's Government in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, made a resolution at the Ninth Session of the Second People's Congress: The county magistrate will personally receive people's visits on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month. After more than a month, this has proven to be a good way to connect with the people. By adopting this method, they have expanded the scope of contact between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, especially providing great convenience to illiterate or non-writing men and women farmers, so that their problems and opinions can be reflected in a timely manner. This has greatly increased the political enthusiasm and trust in the government of these people, and the number of visitors has increased with each passing visit. The basic experience gained by Huang County in this work is: to educate cadres to change their style of work, to receive visitors with the most responsible spirit, and to solve problems correctly and quickly.

On March 15th (the first day of the second lunar month), Huang County Magistrate Jiang led cadres to receive the people for the first time. Because the Ninth Session of the Second People's Congress highly promoted democracy, the representatives formulated the resolution of "County Magistrate Receiving People's Visits" according to the demands of the people. Thus, after the meeting, the representatives conveyed this resolution in a particularly concrete and prominent way. Liu, an old man from Wangjia Village in the Sixth District, did not sleep all night on March 14th (the twenty-ninth day of the first lunar month), and discussed with his wife how to meet the county magistrate the next day. He entered the city before dawn. Old woman Jiang Taiging from Beizao Township rushed to the county people's government in the middle of the night. The gate of the county people's government was deserted in the past. On March 15th, the traffic was endless. From early morning to dusk, a total of 482 people were received (of which old women accounted for more than one-quarter, and illiterate and non-writing people accounted for more than four-fifths). When the visiting people entered the door, they worried about whether their problems could be solved, but they all smiled happily when they came out. Some said, "The stone that has been weighing on me for more than ten years has been lifted." Some said, "Seeing the county magistrate is like seeing the sky, as if a burden has been taken off my shoulders." Many people reflected, "This is really a new atmosphere in the new society."

Because the county magistrate personally came forward to directly receive the people and solve their problems, the problems were solved quickly and effectively. On March 15th, a total of 42 cases were accepted, and eight were resolved on the same day, and 20 were processed within a week. Yu Gongyi, a poor single man from Majiatuan in the Fourth District, was allocated a house belonging to a middle peasant surnamed Lü during the land reform. At the end of the land reform, the house was returned. As a result, Lü's family had a surplus house, and Yu Gongyi had no place to live. He sought help from the village cadres, but they did not care. He sought help from the district and township cadres, but they dragged their feet. The old man was worried about this for more than three years. This day, he met the county magistrate and explained the whole story. The county magistrate immediately sent cadres to work with the old man through the district and township to the village to discuss with the cadres and invited the Lü family to participate in the consultation. Because the Lü family had no ill feelings towards the Yu family, after consultation, they said, "My family can't use all the house. Farmers are one family. I sincerely want to let the small wing room to old Yu to live in." Yu Gongyi expressed his gratitude, and the village cadres had no objections, and the problem was solved. The masses said, "It's good for both sides to do this." (Editor's Note: The property rights of the house should still belong to the middle peasant surnamed Lü, and the local people's government should find another way to solve Yu Gongyi's housing problem at an appropriate time.) Some of the problems raised by the people could not be completely solved for various reasons; some of the requests were not very reasonable. They all made patient explanations and received them warmly, showing the Party and the People's Government's care, love and responsibility for the people. Some problems were more complicated and required investigation before they could be dealt with, so they immediately organized an investigation team, which set off the next day. This attitude of being serious and responsible to the people was praised by the masses, who generally reflected, "This is our own county magistrate, this is our own government."

The process of this work proves that receiving people's visits is indeed an important way for the Party and the People's Government to connect with the masses, and it is a powerful measure to continue to deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines. It not only makes it possible for us to expose and eliminate illegal and undisciplined behavior and bureaucratic style in a timely manner, but also enables us to reflect the achievements of past political movements and the deviations in the implementation of policies, so that we can find the path to continue to deepen the movement, and then fundamentally solve the problems. Especially today, the cultural level of the average farmer is not high, and many people are illiterate and cannot write, and they do not want others to know their problems. Therefore, the personal reception of people's visits by leading cadres has a greater significance. The county magistrate of Huang County received the people twice, and the problems reflected ranged widely: from land reform and review to production and mutual assistance, from the style of cadres to the implementation of policies, they all reflected some opinions. If the leading organs can analyze and study them and raise them to the level of principle, it will be of great benefit to future work.

The work of receiving people's visits is a vivid and specific political lesson for cadres. In the past, the cadres of the Huang County People's Government regarded receiving the masses as a trivial matter that could be managed or not. This time, they personally saw the visiting masses tearfully tell the words that had been pressing on their hearts for several years. Some had even planned to commit suicide because their problems had not been solved for a long time. After the mass visit, the cadres were awakened and their awareness was raised. They began to realize that if they do not care about the "small" urgent needs of the people, serving the people is an empty phrase. They then clearly recognized their natural duties, corrected their attitude towards the people, actively participated in this work, learned from it, and improved their work.

After this period of work with the people, the county summarized the following experiences:

First, prepare before the interview. There are two main points of preparation: one is how to spread the news that the county magistrate receives the masses to the masses, so that everyone knows it. The best way is through the people's congress. The other is to educate all government staff to change their style of work and warmly welcome the visiting masses. The most effective way is to conduct education on the basic national system and the mass point of view, in order to establish and promote the ideological style of being responsible to the masses and serving the masses wholeheartedly; criticize the bureaucratic style of not caring about the suffering of the masses and ignoring the interests of the masses. Huang County's education in this regard is very effective. In the past, when public officials saw the masses coming to inquire, they often put on airs and spoke badly. Some masses were so scared that they ran away from a distance. This time, when they saw the masses coming to visit, they greeted them with a smile from afar, with a kind attitude and cordial hospitality, making the visitors feel very kind.

Second, we must treat visitors with the most responsible spirit, and conscientiously and practically solve the various problems raised by the people, so that each case has a record and everything has a result. All problems that should be solved and can be solved should be solved quickly and effectively. Complicated problems, although they take a long time, should also be dealt with within a certain period. After the processing, the person should be answered verbally or in writing to solicit opinions. If there is anything inappropriate, it will be resolved again. Some problems should be solved, but cannot be completely solved for various reasons, a clear answer should be given and an explanation should be given. For individual unreasonable requests, patient explanations should also be given, indicating the unreasonable places. Regardless of whether the problem can be solved, the visitors must be warmly received, cared for, and cared for, so that they feel that the Party and the People's Government are infinitely concerned, loving, and responsible for the people. This is a concrete problem of handling the relationship between the Party, the government and the people, and it is a concrete reflection of the policies of the Party and the government and the political system of the people's democratic country, and therefore it is a big problem that must be treated with the most responsible spirit. It should be undertaken by cadres who have a certain policy level, care about the suffering of the people, are down-to-earth, patient, serious, and not afraid of hardship. There must be no bureaucratic style such as being careless and perfunctory. Huang County did this, and the people trusted the government more. As a result, on March 29 (the fifteenth day of the second lunar month), 57 more men and women farmers came to visit the county magistrate.

Third, the work after the interview is mainly how to take effective measures to deal with the problems that have not been resolved on the spot as soon as possible. After talking with the masses, the county magistrate of Huang County did two things: one is to convene a cadre meeting to review and summarize, affirm and promote the advantages, criticize and correct the shortcomings, and use this living example to educate cadres, improve cadres' understanding, and consolidate the correct positive emotions; on the other hand, to sort the cases, organize forces to go deep into the villages, and investigate and deal with them in coordination with the district and township through checking spring plowing and production. It is estimated that all of them will be resolved within one month.

    山东省黄县县长定期接待人民来访
    加强了政府和人民的联系有效地教育了干部和群众
    编者按：山东省莱阳专区黄县县长采取了定期的接待人民来访的制度，这是加强党和人民政府与群众联系的一种好方法。它可以使人民群众的各种疾苦和纠纷及时得到解决，使县的领导干部能够及时了解下情，克服官僚主义，更切合实际地指导工作。但关心群众疾苦，加强与群众联系的方法不应只限于此，领导干部还应该教育其他干部，共同树立群众观点和群众路线的工作方法，并建立接待人民来访的经常工作机关和必要的工作制度，使这一工作能全面地系统地进行。
    山东省莱阳专区黄县人民政府在九届二次各界人民代表会议上，根据人民群众要求做出一项决议：每逢农历初一和十五日，县长亲自接待人民群众来访。经过一个多月，证明这是联系人民群众的一种好方法。他们采用这种方法，扩大了党与人民政府和群众联系的范围，特别是给了不识字或不会写字的男女农民以极大方便，使他们的问题和意见也能及时地反映上来；因而大大地提高了这些群众的政治积极性和对政府的信任，来访人数一次比一次增多。黄县在这一工作中所得的基本经验是：教育干部转变作风，以最负责的精神接见来访人，正确迅速地解决问题。
    三月十五日（农历二月初一）黄县姜县长率领干部第一次接待人民群众。由于九届二次人民代表会议高度的发扬了民主，代表们根据人民群众自己的要求制订出“县长接待人民来访”的决议，因此会后代表们回去传达这项决议时就分外具体和突出。六区王家庄的刘老大爷，在三月十四日（农历正月二十九日）一晚上没睡觉，半夜就起来和老伴商量第二天如何见县长，天还没亮就进了城。北皂乡姜太庆老大娘半夜就赶到了县人民政府。县人民政府的大门口往日冷冷落落，三月十五日这一天行人不绝，从清早到傍晚一共接见群众四百八十二人（其中老太婆占四分之一以上，不会写字和不识字的人占五分之四以上）。来访的群众进门时担心着自己的事能否解决，出门来个个喜笑颜开。有的说：“十多年的石头放下了。”有的说：“见了县长如见天，好似身上卸下一付担。”不少群众反映：“这真是新社会的新气象。”
    由于县长亲自出面，直接接见群众和解决群众的问题，所以问题解决得既迅速又切实。三月十五日一共受理四十二个案件，当天就解决了八件，一周内处理了二十件。四区马家疃贫农单身汉于公义，土地改革当中分得的房子是吕姓中农的，结束土地改革时将房退回。这样，吕家房子有剩余，于公义就没有房住了。找村干部解决，村干部不管；找区、乡干部，也拖拉不办。老头子为这事担了三年多心思。这天见了县长谈明原委，县长马上派干部协同于老头通过区乡到村，与干部商讨，并请吕家参加，一同协商。吕家因为和于家并无恶感，经过协商，就说：“我家房子用不了，农民是一家，我诚心愿意把小厢房让给老于住。”于公义表示感谢，村干部也没意见，问题解决了。群众都说：“这样办两下都好。”（编者按：房产权仍应属吕姓中农，当地人民政府在适当时机应另外设法为于公义解决住房问题。）有些群众提出的问题因各种原因，目前尚不能彻底解决；有些要求不甚合理，他们都作了耐心解释，热情接待，显示了党与人民政府对人民的关怀、热爱和负责。也有些问题比较复杂，须经调查才能处理，他们就马上组织了调查组，第二天就出发。这种对人民群众认真负责的态度，得到了群众好评，普遍反映：“这才是我们自己的县长，这才是我们自己的政府。”
    这一段工作的经过，证明接待人民来访确是党与人民政府联系群众的一种重要方式，对于继续深入开展反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪斗争是一个有力的措施。它不仅使我们有可能及时揭发并肃清违法乱纪行为和官僚主义作风，并能及时反映历次政治运动中的成就和执行政策上的偏差，使我们找到继续深入运动的门径，进而从根本上解决问题。特别是今天一般农民的文化水平还不高，很多人都不识字，不会写，而自己的问题又不愿让别人知道，因此，领导干部亲自接见人民来访便有了更加重大的意义。黄县县长两次接待人民来访，反映的问题范围很广：从土地改革、复查到生产互助，从干部作风到执行政策，都反映了一些意见。如果领导机关能加以分析研究，提高到原则上来认识，对今后进行工作好处是很大的。
    接待人民来访的工作，是给干部上了一次生动而又具体的政治课。黄县人民政府的干部，过去长时间把接待人民群众看成是一件可管可不管的琐碎小事；这次他们亲眼看到来访群众泪流满面地讲出数年来压在心里的话，有的曾因问题长期得不到解决而打算自杀。经过群众访问，干部们警醒了，觉悟提高了。他们开始认识到：如果不关心人民群众“细小”的迫切要求，为人民服务便是一句空话。从而明确认识了自己的天职，端正了对人民的态度，积极主动参与这一工作，从中得到教育，改进了工作。
    经过这段接见人民的工作，该县总结出以下经验：
    一、接谈前要作好准备工作。准备工作主要是两点：一是如何把县长接待人民群众来访这一消息传到群众中去，做到家喻户晓，妇孺皆知。最好的方法是通过各界人民代表会议。一是教育所有政府工作人员转变作风，热情招待来访群众。最有效的办法是进行国家基本制度和群众观点的教育，以树立和发扬对群众负责、全心全意为群众服务的思想作风；批判不关心群众疾苦，漠视群众利益的官僚主义作风。黄县进行这一教育很有效。过去公务人员看见群众来问事，常摆架子，说话态度不好，有的群众吓得老远就躲开。这次他们看见群众来访，老远就笑面相迎，态度和蔼，殷勤招待，使来访者感到非常亲切。
    二、必须以最负责的精神对待来访人，认真切实地解决人民所提出的各项问题，作到案案有记录，事事有着落。凡应该解决而又能够解决的，均应切实迅速解决。问题复杂的，虽需要较长时间，也应在一定期限内处理完毕。处理后均应以口头或书面答复本人，征询意见。有不适当处，再行解决。有些问题应该解决，但因种种原因目前还不能彻底解决的，应该明确答复，并进行解释。个别要求不合理的，也应该耐心解释，指明不合理的地方。不管问题能否解决，对来访人均须热情招待，体贴照顾，使其感到党和人民政府对人民是无限关怀、热爱和负责的。这是具体处理党、政府和人民的关系的问题，是具体体现党与政府的政策及人民民主国家的政治制度的问题，因而是一个大问题，必须以最负责的精神对待。要由有一定政策水平、关心人民群众疾苦、做事踏实耐心、严肃认真和不辞辛苦的干部来担当。决不能稍微带有粗枝大叶、不了了之等官僚主义作风。黄县这样作了，人民对政府更加信任，因而在三月二十九日（农历二月十五日）又有五十七名男女农民来访县长。
    三、接谈后的工作，主要是对当场未能解决的问题如何采取有效措施，早日处理完。黄县县长在和群众接谈后作了两方面的工作：一是召开干部会议进行检讨、总结，肯定与发扬优点，批判与改正缺点，以这一活的事例教育干部，提高干部认识，巩固正确的积极的情绪；另一方面将案件进行排队，组织力量深入乡村，通过检查春耕生产，协同区乡调查处理。估计一月内即可全部解决。
