    Review of Waste Occurring in the Translation and Publication of Soviet Agricultural Science Books
    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on April 1st published a letter from reader Yang Lanfang regarding "Correcting Waste in the Translation and Publication of Advanced Soviet Agricultural Science Books." The Compilation Committee of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Editorial Office of the Zhonghua Book Company have responded successively. Excerpts are published below:

    The Compilation Committee of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute stated in its letter that Comrade Yang Lanfang's opinion is correct. The letter explains: They began preparing to publish the "Soviet Agricultural Science Series" in March 1950. At that time, there were very few books introducing advanced Soviet agricultural science, and there was a lack of people who understood Russian and were familiar with agricultural science. Therefore, they only considered encouraging everyone to translate more, without specific editing plans, which caused confusion in the work. The overlap in content between "Agricultural Techniques for Prairie Afforestation" and "The Theory and Achievements of the Williams System" in the series occurred when the editors returned from the land reform and were handing over work. This was because the editors' work attitude was not serious and responsible and the work lacked necessary systems. The committee has now notified Zhonghua Book Company to stop publishing "The Theory and Achievements of the Williams System."

    The Editorial Office of the Zhonghua Book Company, in its letter, reviewed its mistake of publishing translations of Soviet agricultural science books that had already been translated by other publishers, causing waste, and resolved to correct it. It also reviewed the problem of failing to urge the Compilation Committee of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute to pay attention to correcting the duplication in the "Soviet Agricultural Science Series" (published by Zhonghua Book Company).

### 对翻译出版苏联农业科学书籍工作中发生浪费的检讨

    对翻译出版苏联农业科学书籍工作中发生浪费的检讨
    四月一日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者杨兰芳关于“纠正介绍苏联先进农业科学书籍在翻译出版中的浪费”的来信。华北农业科学研究所编译委员会和中华书局编辑所已经先后来了答复。现特摘要发表于后：
    华北农业科学研究所编译委员会来信认为杨兰芳同志的意见是正确的。来信说明：他们在一九五○年三月筹备出版“苏联农业科学丛书”。当时介绍苏联先进农业科学的书籍还绝无仅有，既懂俄文而又对农业科学较熟悉的人也很缺乏，因此他们只考虑鼓励大家多翻译，而没有具体编辑计划，这样就使工作发生了混乱。该丛书中“草原造林的农业技术”和“威廉士学说的理论及其成就”两书内容大部重复的情况发生在编辑人员参加土地改革回来、工作交接的时候，这是因为编者工作态度不够认真负责和工作缺乏必要的制度。现该委员会已通知中华书局停止出版“威廉士学说的理论及其成就”一书。
    中华书局编辑所来信，检讨了该局出版了不少其它出版社已有译本的苏联农业科学书籍译本，造成浪费的错误，决心纠正；并对事先未促请华北农业科学研究所编译委员会注意纠正“苏联农业科学丛书”（中华书局出版）中重复现象的问题也作了检查。
