    On the Front Lines of National Economic Construction
    Construction Begins on the Ganlang Highway in Gansu
    The construction of key projects on the Linxia to Xicang section of the Ganlang Highway, which runs from Lanzhou to Langmu Temple on the Gansu border, has begun. The Ganlang Highway is 458 kilometers long. Once completed, it will connect to the highway from Langmu Temple to Aba in northwestern Sichuan Province, and the highway from Chengdu to Aba. The construction of the Ganlang Highway is of great importance to the economic and cultural development of the Tibetan areas on the border of Gansu, Sichuan, and Qinghai provinces, and to the promotion of material exchange among the Tibetan people. The 149-kilometer section of the Ganlang Highway from Lanzhou to Linxia has already been opened to traffic, and the 103-kilometer section from Linxia to Xiahe was also opened to traffic in mid-November last year. This year, it is planned to build the 209-kilometer section from Linxia to Xicang into a fully qualified highway, and to rush to open the 100-kilometer section from Xicang to Langmu Temple to traffic.

    Liu Dalin Drives a Truck Safely for Over 87,000 Kilometers
    Liu Dalin, a truck driver from the Yumen Mining Bureau Transportation Team in Gansu, has set a new record for extending the truck maintenance-free period. The truck (a 419 Da Daoqi truck) driven by Liu Dalin has been driven safely for more than 87,000 kilometers in the two and a half years since its major overhaul in November 1950 until the beginning of May this year, without any accidents or major repairs. This record exceeds the original maintenance-free period target set by the transportation department by nearly two times, greatly saving on truck repair costs and extending the life of the truck. The truck is still running safely. The reporter recently interviewed this driver with 15 years of driving experience. He said modestly that his driving skills are not particularly mysterious, and that the main thing is to be able to adhere to the following points: First, diligent maintenance, frequent inspection, and constant attention to the lubrication of important parts of the truck. The engine of the truck he drives has not burned a tile once in two and a half years; he has consistently adhered to the "three inspections" system of stopping for inspection, inspecting at stations, and regular inspections. Second, comply with safe driving operating procedures. Third, maintain good relationships with his apprentices; his assistant has never caused any trouble. Liu Dalin said: "Experienced drivers know these methods, the question is whether they can stick to them." He said: "Now the truck is the property of the people's motherland, and I want to cherish it as I cherish my own things." Liu Dalin was promoted to truck squad leader this spring. In the April "all-round red" competition, six of the eight squads he led won the red flag.

    Water Conservancy Departments Transfer Cadres to Support Yellow River Control Work
    Water conservancy departments across the country are transferring cadres to support the preparatory work for the fundamental control of the Yellow River. In April and May, the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the water conservancy bureaus of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, the Central South Administrative Committee, the Henan Provincial People's Government, and the Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Bureau of the East China Administrative Committee transferred more than 200 experts and staff in civil engineering, farmland water conservancy, hydrological surveying, and sediment research to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to participate in the preparatory work for Yellow River control. Among the nine soil and water conservation survey teams and one main stream survey team that departed not long ago, staff transferred from various places accounted for 30% of the total number of people.

    "People Rest, Work Doesn't Stop" at the Guanting Reservoir Construction Site
    The night scene at the Guanting Reservoir construction site in Hebei is very spectacular and moving. In order to ensure that floods are blocked during this year's flood season, the workers are using the method of "people rest, work doesn't stop", with three shifts working around the clock to rush to repair the dam. When night is about to cover the Guanting Gorge, the construction site power plant sends out more than 270,000 degrees of electricity, and immediately more than 2,000 lights shine brightly. The lights extend westward from the dam construction site to the stone quarrying area in the Shuiguan Village gully, 15 li away, and also illuminate the soil extraction area on the west mountain along the light railway; to the south, they extend to the Shizhuangzi material extraction area, 5 li away.
    There is a house on the hillside east of the dam, with people constantly coming and going all night, much like the command post at the front of the battle, which is the dam construction headquarters. Sitting here are the leaders of the engineering bureau, engineers, foremen, and heads of units such as the transportation section, tractor brigade, soil mechanics laboratory, and propaganda and mobilization group. They are studying the dam construction situation and the progress of the project, and arranging the work day by day until the end of June to ensure the interception of floods during the flood season.
    At the dam construction site, within an area of 40,000 square meters, the workers are carrying clay and pebbles to the dam in an orderly and continuous stream. Drivers are operating bulldozers and tractors, with sparks occasionally spraying from the exhaust pipes, and the roar of the machines and the songs from the loudspeakers break the silence of the night. At the end of the spillway, stonemasons are working hard to excavate the last 10,000 cubic meters of stone. Workers have transported a large number of reinforcing bars and cement to the site. The formwork for the west wall of the spillway's inlet has been erected, the concrete mixer has been installed, and concrete work has begun. At the construction sites of the water intake towers and stilling basins at both ends of the water conveyance channel, huge searchlights illuminate the competition red flags on the trestles. Workers are delivering the mixed concrete from the trestles, 20-30 meters high, to pour the gate piers of the water intake towers and the bottom plates of the stilling basins.
    Midnight is the time for shift change. Teams of workers pour in from the new village west of the river, carrying model red flags and shoulder poles, heading to the dam construction site with high spirits. The workers who have completed the first half of the night's work also leave the site amid joyful laughter and conversation. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    321 Geological Exploration Team Sets New Record for Core Recovery Rate
    The No. 1 drilling rig of the 321 Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, working in the Tongguanshan area of Anhui Province, adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet "one-time sand injection method." It has set a new record for core recovery rate. In April, the No. 1 drilling rig had 18 instances where the core recovery rate reached 100%. From April 1st to May 15th, the No. 1 drilling rig drilled a total of 128.545 meters deep (diorite), and the extracted core was 116.565 meters long. The length of the extracted core accounted for 90.68% of the total footage.
    In the past, the 321 Exploration Team had to raise the drill seven or eight times per shift (eight hours) to inject sand. Since the promotion of the advanced experience of the "one-time sand injection method", the drill is only raised once or twice per shift. After the number of times the drill is raised and lowered is reduced, the core is less likely to be damaged and is easier to extract, so the core extracted now is complete. Improving the core recovery rate is of great help in understanding underground resources, such as calculating ore reserves and measuring the location of ore bodies. (Xinhua News Agency)
    A Huge Aggregate Transportation Machine Successfully Trial-Produced
    Shanghai Joint State-Private Hwa Tung Steel Construction Factory Limited has successfully manufactured an aggregate transportation machine, creating the conditions for the mechanization of precast concrete work required for building heavy-duty factories.
    The function of the aggregate transportation machine is equivalent to a larger aggregate mixing plant. According to its working procedure, it is divided into seven parts: sand and gravel are first transported by a mobile belt conveyor to the storage area, heated and dried, and then sent by a belt conveyor to a bucket conveyor. The bucket conveyor carries them to the top, 14 meters high, and sends them to a segmented material feeder. The sand and gravel are dumped from the segmented material feeder onto scales, weighed, and then dumped into the mixer. After the sand and gravel are mixed by the mixer, they are sent to the construction site by truck for pouring. The aggregate transportation machine can complete 150 tons of aggregate mixing work per hour. If this workload were done by manual labor, it would require 1,500 workers to complete it in one hour; now only seven workers are needed to look after this huge machine.
    The complete set of aggregate transportation machines is made of 20 tons of steel and 5 tons of pig iron. This is a major collective creation by the engineers and 111 mechanical workers of the Hwa Tung Steel Construction Factory. Prior to this, they had never seen such a machine. In order to meet the urgent needs of a key construction project in the Northeast, they trial-produced it according to the principle of a coal conveyor in a power plant. It only took one and a half months from design to successful manufacture. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    甘肃兰郎公路修筑工程开工
    从兰州到甘肃边境郎木寺的兰郎公路临夏到西仓段的部分重点工程，已经开工。兰郎公路共长四百五十八公里，全部修筑完工以后，就可以继续修筑郎木寺到四川省西北部的阿坝间的公路，和成都到阿坝的公路衔接起来。兰郎公路的修筑，对发展甘肃、四川、青海三省边境藏族地区藏族人民的经济、文化和开展物资交流，有很重要的作用。兰郎公路兰州到临夏段的一百四十九公里公路早已通车，临夏到夏河段一百零三公里的公路也在去年十一月中旬通车。今年计划把临夏到西仓段的二百零九公里修成完全合乎标准的公路，并把西仓到郎木寺段共长一百公里的公路抢修通车。（新华社）
    柳大林驾驶的一辆大卡车
    安全行驶了八万七千多公里
    甘肃玉门矿务局运输队汽车驾驶员柳大林，创造了延长汽车免修期的最高纪录。柳大林驾驶的一辆大卡车（四一九大道奇车），从一九五零年十一月大修理以后，直到今年五月初的两年半中，已安全行驶了八万七千多公里，从来没有发生任何责任事故，也没有大修理过。这个纪录超过了原来运输部门规定的免修期指标近两倍，大大节约了汽车修理费和延长了汽车的寿命。现在这辆大卡车还在继续安全行驶中。记者日前访问了这位有十五年驾驶历史的驾驶员。他很谦虚地说，他的驾驶技术并没有什么特殊奥妙，主要是能够坚持下面几点：第一、勤保养，勤检查，经常注意汽车各重要部分的润滑。他驾驶的汽车引擎，两年半中没有烧过一次瓦；他一贯坚持停车检查、到站检查、定期检查的“三检”制。第二、遵守安全行驶操作法。第三、师徒关系搞得好，他的助手从来没有给闯过乱子。柳大林说：“这些办法老练的驾驶员都懂得，问题在于能不能坚持。”他说：“现在汽车是人民祖国的财产，我要爱护它像爱护自己的东西一样”。柳大林今年春天已被提升为汽车分队长。在四月份满堂红竞赛中，他领导的八个小队有六个得到了红旗。

    水利部门调派干部支援治黄工作
    全国各地水利部门正调派干部支援根治黄河的准备工作。四五月份，中央人民政府水利部、长江水利委员会、山西和陕西两省的水利局、中南行政委员会、河南省人民政府、华东行政委员会农林水利局等单位，共调出土木工程、农田水利、水文测验、泥沙研究等方面的专家和工作人员二百多人，来黄河水利委员会参加治黄准备工作。不久以前出发的九个水土保持查勘队和一个干流查勘队中，各地调来的工作人员占总人数的百分之三十。（新华社）
    官厅水库工地“人停工不停”
    河北官厅水库工地夜景是非常壮观动人的。为了保证在今年汛期拦阻洪水，工人们采用“人停工不停”的办法，日夜三班轮换赶修拦河坝。当夜幕快要罩上官厅山峡的时候，工地发电厂就送出二十万零七千多度的电流，立刻两千多盏电灯齐放光明。灯光由拦河坝工地现场向西延续到十五里外的水关村山沟的取石区，又照着轻便铁道爬上西山的取土区；向南，延续到五里外的施庄子取料区。
    拦河坝东边山腰上有所房子，通夜人来人去不断，很像阵地前沿的指挥部，这就是筑坝指挥所。这里坐着工程局领导人、工程师、领工员和运输科、拖拉机大队、土工试验室，宣传鼓动组等单位负责人，他们研究着拦河坝施工情况和工程进度，把工作逐日排列到六月底，以确保伏汛期拦阻洪水。
    拦河坝工地现场上，在四万平方公尺的地区内，民工们挑着粘土和卵石上坝，川流不息，很有秩序。驾驶手们操纵着推土机和拖拉机，火花不时从排气筒里喷出，机器运转的轰隆声和广播器传出的歌声划破了宁静的夜空。在溢洪道的尾部，石工们正在紧张地开凿溢洪道最后的一万多方石头。工人们已把大批的钢筋、水泥运到现场，溢洪道进口部分的西边墙已树立起模型板，安置好混凝土搅拌机，开始浇筑混凝土工程。输水道两端的进水塔和静水池工地现场上，巨大的探照灯光照耀着高架上的竞赛红旗。工人从二三十公尺高的高架上把搅拌好的混凝土送下来，浇筑进水塔的闸墩和静水池的底板。
    午夜是交班的时刻。一队队民工从河西新村涌来，他们举着模范红旗，扛着扁担，精神饱满地走向拦河坝工地现场。完成了前半夜工作的民工也在欢乐的谈笑声中离开现场。    （据新华社讯）
    三二一地质勘探队
    创造岩芯采取率新纪录
    在安徽省铜官山区工作的中央人民政府地质部三二一勘探队一号钻机，采用苏联“一次投砂法”的先进经验。创造了岩芯采取率新纪录。在四月份中，一号钻机曾有十八次岩芯采取率达到百分之百。从四月一日到五月十五日，一号钻机共钻进一百二十八点五四五公尺深（闪长岩），取出的岩芯有一百十六点五六五公尺长，取出岩芯的长度占总进尺的百分之九十点六八。
    三二一勘探队过去为了投砂，每班（八小时）一般都要提钻七、八次，自从推广了“一次投砂法”先进经验后，每班只提钻一两次。上下钻次数减少以后，岩芯就不容易碰损，取上来也比较容易，因此现在取到的岩芯都是完整的。岩芯采取率提高后，对于了解地下资源情况如计算矿量和测量矿体的位置等，有很大的帮助。    （新华社）
    一座庞大的砂石运输机试制成功
    上海公私合营华东钢铁建筑厂有限公司制造砂石运输机成功，为建筑重型工厂所需要的预铸混凝土工作的机械化创造了条件。
    砂石运输机的作用相当于一个较大的砂石搅拌工厂，按照它的工作程序共分七个部分：砂和石子首先由流动皮带运输机载到储料所，加热烘干后由皮带输送机送往链斗运输机，由链斗运输机载到十四公尺高的顶点，送往分段运料机，砂和石子由分段运料机倾倒到磅秤上，过磅后再倾倒到搅拌机里。砂和石子经过搅拌机搅拌完成以后，再由汽车送到工地，就可以浇铸。砂石运输机每小时能够完成一百五十吨的砂石搅拌工作，这个工作量如果用手工劳动，那就需要一千五百个工人在一小时内才能完成；现在只要七个工人看管这庞大机器就行了。
    全套砂石运输机由二十吨钢料和五吨生铁制成。这是华东钢铁建筑厂的工程师和一百十一个机械工人们一个重大的集体创造。在这以前，他们并没有看见过这类机器，为了解决东北一个重点建筑工程的紧急需要，他们才按照发电厂运煤机的原理进行试制的。从设计到制造成功只一个半月时间。
