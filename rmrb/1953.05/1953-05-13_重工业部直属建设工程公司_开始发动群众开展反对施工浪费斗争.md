    Construction Engineering Company Directly Under the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Begins Mass Movement to Combat Construction Waste
    The Construction Engineering Company Directly Under the Ministry of Heavy Industry is strengthening its leadership in the anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system movement, criticizing the incorrect understanding of some cadres and masses, and sending out work groups to go deep into construction sites to mobilize the masses to expose waste and the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility in construction.

    After the company launched the anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system movement in early April, it did not effectively mobilize the masses to participate in this movement. Some cadres and masses did not correctly understand the purpose and significance of this movement, and had some ideological concerns. Some masses thought: "If waste is exposed, can it be guaranteed that there will be no more waste in the future?" "Waste has been opposed in the past, but it could not be eliminated. Can it be done this time?" Some cadres dared not boldly examine the shortcomings and mistakes in past construction, and were afraid that "if the masses expose mistakes, they will have to 'take the blame'." They said: "After a period of opposition, it is we who suffer." They were afraid of being punished in this movement. Some cadres who were busy with construction preparation work thought that "if everyone participates in this movement, it will affect the preparation work." In the past, in the struggle against bureaucracy, some people had exposed the shortcomings in leadership work. They said: "The anti-bureaucracy movement is over; now the anti-waste movement is against us."

    In light of the above situation, the company held a Party committee meeting, examined the shortcomings of the past movement, and specifically stipulated the steps and methods of the anti-waste and anti-no-one-responsible movement. In mid-April, the company held a meeting of employee representatives. Manager Li Tai made a report, criticizing the incorrect understanding of the movement, and explaining that the purpose of this movement is to educate all employees, establish the concept of economic accounting, and establish a responsibility system, so as to better complete this year's basic construction tasks. After the meeting, cadres and masses of various sections, teams, and construction sites of the company discussed this report and re-studied the documents on opposing waste and opposing no one taking responsibility. Every other day, the company also held reporting meetings for the heads of various sections, teams, and construction sites to report on the ideological situation in the movement, so as to correctly unfold this movement.

    In order to specifically help lower-level cadres do a good job in this movement, the company established two work groups, which went deep into the front lines to specifically solve problems in the movement. Manager Li Wanjie led a work group to the Beijing work area to understand the situation and solve the current problems in construction preparation work. The company also directly sent out a work group to mobilize the masses in Tiexi, Beita, and other places in Shenyang, adopting methods such as "careful accounting," "recollection meetings," and "investigation of typical waste incidents" to guide the masses to examine waste. In the past, the company only knew that there was waste in the use of materials, but did not know how much waste there was. The company's finance section used the "careful accounting" method to statistically analyze the amount of waste. They found that out of the more than 10,000 cubic meters of formwork used last year, more than 4,000 cubic meters were wasted. This waste was equivalent to a loss of more than 4 billion yuan in state property. The finance section told the masses about this waste figure. The masses said: "One item of formwork alone caused a loss of more than 4 billion yuan. This is terrible!" Workers at the Tiexi construction site exposed the incident of wasting wood. Last year, the company handed over more than 500 cubic meters of leftover wood to the Tiexi Workers' Winter Training Class for safekeeping. The winter training class did not send anyone to take charge, and the people from the dining hall and boiler room arbitrarily took the wood to burn, burning more than 300 cubic meters. The workers said: When we use wood, we are reluctant to throw away even a small piece of wood. Now 300 cubic meters have been burned all at once. Why is no one in charge? Who should be responsible? Through the discussion of this incident, the workers also exposed many phenomena of no one taking responsibility. They said: "Last year, in order to rush the progress, we asked for materials indiscriminately and discarded tools indiscriminately. Some people took away our wood and bricks, but no one cared. No one checked the concrete mixing; no one checked the whitewashing. The quality was poor, and no one took responsibility." They believed that a system of dedicated personnel and dedicated positions must be established. The company's administrative section and technical inspection section also determined the focus of inspection. The technical inspection section focused on inspecting the situation of poor project quality and prepared to exhibit these situations to educate all employees. The administrative section focused on inspecting the use of management fees. Last year, the company printed many forms that could not be used. Now there are still several large bundles of forms in the warehouse, which have become waste. Management expenses are generally overspent in various construction units. The administrative section is calculating the amount of overspending and studying the reasons for the overspending. Some sections and teams also discovered problems in this year's preparation work when inspecting last year's work. Cadres of the materials section said: "We purchase materials without design documents as a basis, so the materials we buy cannot be used. Last year, 37 billion yuan of materials were overstocked. Before construction has even started this year, we have found that 5.9 billion yuan of materials will be overstocked."

    At present, although the masses of the company have been mobilized to boldly expose the shortcomings and mistakes in construction, the masses in some individual areas have not been mobilized. The workers at the Beita construction site have not yet begun to expose shortcomings. Recently, the company has sent special personnel to help the anti-waste and anti-no-one-responsible work at the Beita construction site. After mobilizing the masses to expose general waste phenomena, the company will guide the masses to focus on discussing typical waste incidents, and analyze the causes of waste and the ways to overcome waste from all aspects, so as to prepare for the next step of establishing a responsibility system.

### 重工业部直属建设工程公司  开始发动群众开展反对施工浪费斗争

    重工业部直属建设工程公司
    开始发动群众开展反对施工浪费斗争
    中央重工业部直属建设工程公司加强对于反浪费和建立责任制运动的领导，批判有些干部和群众的不正确的认识，并派出工作组，深入工地，发动群众，揭露施工中浪费和无人负责的现象。
    该公司在四月初开展反浪费和建立责任制运动以后，没有很好地发动群众来参加这个运动，有些干部和群众也没有正确地认识这个运动的目的和意义，有着一些思想顾虑。有些群众认为：“揭发了浪费现象，能够担保以后不浪费吗？”“过去反过浪费，都没能反掉，这一次能行吗？”有些干部不敢大胆检查过去施工中的缺点和错误，并且害怕“群众揭发出错误来，自己要‘沾包’。”他们说：“反了一阵，倒楣的是我们。”他们害怕在这次运动中，会受到处分。有些忙于施工准备工作的干部，则以为“都来参加这个运动，会影响准备工作”。过去在反对官僚主义斗争中，有些人曾经揭露过领导工作中的缺点，他们说：“反官僚主义，已经过去了；现在反浪费，是反我们了。”
    根据上述情况，该公司召开了党委委员会议，检查了过去运动中的缺点，具体地规定了反浪费反无人负责运动的步骤和方法。四月中旬，该公司召开职工代表会议，经理李太做了报告，批判了对于运动的不正确的认识，并说明这个运动的目的，在于教育全体职工，树立经济核算的思想，建立责任制度，以便更好地完成今年基本建设的任务。会后，该公司各科、队和工地的干部和群众讨论了这个报告，并重新学习了反对浪费反对无人负责的文件。每隔一天，该公司还召开各科、队和工地的负责人的汇报会议，汇报运动中的思想情况，以便正确地展开这个运动。
    为了具体地帮助下级干部搞好这个运动，该公司成立了两个工作组，深入现场，具体地解决运动中的问题。经理李万杰带领一个工作组，到北京工区，了解情况，并解决目前施工准备工作中的问题。该公司还直接派出一个工作组，分别在沈阳铁西、北塔等地发动群众，采用“算细账”、“回忆会”、“典型浪费事件的调查”等方法，引导群众检查浪费。过去该公司只知道在材料使用上有浪费现象，但不知道究竟浪费多少。该公司财务科采用“算细账”的方法，统计了浪费的数字。他们发现去年使用的一万多立方公尺的模型板，就有四千多立方公尺被浪费了。这个浪费，等于损失了国家财产四十多亿元。财务科把这个浪费数字，告诉群众，群众说：“一项模型板，就损失了四十多亿，这还得了！”铁西工地的工人揭发了浪费木料的事件。去年该公司把剩余的五百多立方公尺的木料，交给铁西工人冬训班保管。冬训班没有派出专人来负责，饭堂、锅炉房的人就任意拿走这批木料烧火，烧了三百多立方公尺。工人们说：我们使用木料时，连一块小木头都舍不得丢掉。现在一下子就烧了三百多立方公尺，为什么没有人管呢？应该谁负责呢？通过这个事件的讨论，工人们还揭发了许多无人负责的现象。他们说：“去年抢进度，乱要材料，乱丢工具。有人把我们的木料、砖头，拿走了，我们都没有人过问。打混凝土，没人检查；抹白灰，也没人检查。质量不好，谁也不负责任。”他们认为必须建立专人专职制度。该公司行政科和技术检查科还确定了检查的重点。技术检查科着重检查工程质量低劣的情况，并准备把这些情况，展览出来以教育全体职工。行政科着重检查管理费的使用情况。去年该公司印了很多表报，不能用，现在还有好几大捆表报放在仓库内，变成废物。各施工单位在管理费用上，都普遍地超过规定。行政科正统计超支的数字，并研究超支的原因。有些科、队在检查去年工作时，也发现了今年准备工作的问题。材料科干部说：“我们购买材料，没有设计文件作为根据，因而买来的材料不能用。去年积压了三百七十亿元的材料。今年还没开工，我们发现将有五十九亿元的材料要积压下来。”
    目前该公司的群众虽然已经动员起来，大胆揭发施工中的缺点和错误；但还有个别地区的群众没有动起来。北塔工地的工人，还未开始揭发缺点。最近该公司已派出专人，帮助北塔工地反浪费反无人负责的工作。在发动群众揭发一般的浪费现象以后，该公司将引导群众，集中地讨论典型的浪费事件，并从各方面分析产生浪费的原因和克服浪费的办法，以便为下一步建立责任制度，作好准备。
