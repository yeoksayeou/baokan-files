Editor's Note: The following is a letter written by all the members of the Youth League branch of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the mother of Zoya and Shura last August, and the reply letter from the mother of Zoya and Shura last December. Although this happened half a year ago, it still has practical significance, so it is published below.

(I) Letter to the Mother of Zoya and Shura

Respected Mother Lyubov Timofeevna Kosmodemyanskaya:

Summer has arrived, and the breeze from the Pacific Ocean is blowing into our newly born motherland. The motors in the factories are roaring day and night, and the rice ears in the fields are surging like waves in the wind. Our motherland, which is preparing to advance on the road to socialism under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, is so dear and lovely to us. How happy and fortunate are the young people growing up in the era of Stalin and Mao Zedong!

We are now reading "The Story of Zoya and Shura" on the grass under the shade of trees. This is the book selected for study by our Youth League branch. We are preparing to once again draw precious strength from Zoya.

In the past, we watched the movie "Tanya." Zoya's heroic and moving actions once stirred us. Today, as we read this book again, we seem to have walked into Zoya's home in the poplar forest. We see how Zoya and Shura grew up under the education of the Lenin Communist Youth League and you. They are smart, enthusiastic, honest, and brave; they love labor, love science, love their mother, and love their country; they also care about the fate of Spain… We saw the tragic scene of Zoya cursing the fascist bandits on the gallows, and we also saw how Shura, this eagle-like young man, drove a tank with the flames of revenge to avenge his sister, and as a result, he also died heroically in the anti-fascist struggle… We shed tears!

At this moment, we are reminded of Liu Hulan, the heroic daughter of our motherland. How similar they are—they generously dedicated their youthful lives for the liberation of the motherland and for the liberation cause of the working people all over the world. What kind of people are they? Oleg Koshevoy said it well: they are "noble souls," "noble souls" cultivated by the superior social system and advanced class ideology.

We admire you for having such heroic and immortal children;
We are proud to have such glorious and great examples.

Now, the war-mongers of American imperialism are playing the "frenzied march of world aggression policy" day and night. On the one hand, they are shamelessly delaying negotiations at Panmunjom, and on the other hand, they are spreading bacterial plagues in Korea and our Northeast with their sinful bloody hands; they are desperately arming the remnants of Hitler in West Germany, and frantically supporting the remnants of Japanese fascists, preparing to provoke a new war, and wanting to destroy the peaceful and happy life that Zoya, Shura, Liu Hulan, and thousands of other heroic martyrs created for us with their blood.

We are the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the defenders of world peace. We deeply understand the meaning of a peaceful and happy life, and we also deeply understand the responsibility of defending this life.

If the war-mongers dare to attack us, in order to protect our gray-haired mothers and red-scarved younger brothers and sisters, we must firmly hold our guns and, together with the peace-loving soldiers of fraternal countries led by the Soviet Union, stand on the forefront of the struggle to defend peace and give the enemies who launch the war a merciless blow. Now, the outstanding sons and daughters of our motherland—the Chinese People's Volunteers and the heroic Korean People's Army—are carrying out this sacred task in Korea.

Glorious and respected mother, for the prosperity of the people of the motherland and for the happiness of the people all over the world, you diligently educated your beloved children and generously dedicated their heroic lives. Therefore, you are not only the mother of heroic children, but also the common mother of peace-loving people all over the world. You can be proud of this, and you can also receive people's deep love and boundless respect.

The blood of Zoya and Shura will not be shed in vain, they will always live in our hearts. Their heroic examples will always guide and inspire millions of working youth of both sexes around the world to stride forward to a better tomorrow!

Let's talk again!
Please accept our highest revolutionary salute!
And wish you good health!

(II) Reply from the Mother of Zoya and Shura
Dear soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Thank you for your enthusiastic letter, thank you for expressing your respect for my children and your kind condolences to me personally.

When I heard that my ordinary work—the true story about my beloved children, Zoya and Shura—aroused such a warm response from you, I felt great comfort and great happiness.

The path of my children is the path of countless young heroes who dedicated their lives for freedom and happiness. There are already thousands of young men and women in the world who have established the same merits as my children in order to safeguard and strive for freedom and happiness.

As a mother, my loss is great; but my children did not sacrifice in vain. Their short but brilliant lives have inspired many other young soldiers to fight for the cause of truth and justice. Therefore, when I realize this, my mother's heart is filled with due pride.

The Soviet people warmly salute the Chinese People's Volunteers who are assisting the Korean people and fighting alongside the Korean people to defeat the American imperialist aggressors.

In this sacred war of liberation, all people who love freedom and peace in the world stand firmly with the people of China and Korea. They angrily protest to the war-mongers.

The powerful movement to defend world peace is growing and strengthening. The simple people of all countries will never allow the bloody plans of the aggressors to be realized. All aggressors will be severely punished for their crimes.

I extend my warm motherly salute to you—the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who are fighting to defend world peace and to strive for the prosperity of your motherland, and I hope that you will achieve success in this noble struggle. All the Soviet people, like me, hope so.

Loving you, Lyubov Timofeevna Kosmodemyanskaya
December 22, 1952, Moscow

### 解放军某部青年战士和卓娅母亲的通信

    解放军某部青年战士和卓娅母亲的通信
    编者按：这是中国人民解放军某部青年团支部全体团员去年八月写给卓娅和舒拉母亲的信及卓娅和舒拉的母亲去年十二月的复信。这虽是半年以前的事，但仍有现实意义，特发表在下面。
    （一）给卓娅和舒拉母亲的信
    敬爱的留·柯斯莫捷米扬斯卡娅母亲：
    夏天来了，太平洋的和风一阵一阵地吹进我们新生的祖国，工厂里的马达日夜轰鸣，田野里的稻穗迎风似浪，在党和毛主席领导下正在准备向社会主义道路前进的祖国，对我们是多么亲切和可爱，生长在斯大林、毛泽东年代的青年是多么愉快和幸福啊！
    现在我们正在树荫下的草地上读着“卓娅和舒拉的故事”，这是我们青年团支部选定学习的书籍，我们准备将再一次从卓娅身上取得珍贵的力量。
    过去我们看过电影“丹孃”，卓娅的可歌可泣的行动，曾经激动过我们。今天再看这本书，我们又仿佛走进杨树林卓娅的家里来了，我们看到卓娅和舒拉如何在列宁共产主义青年团和你的教养下成长起来，他们聪明、热情、诚实、勇敢；他们爱劳动，爱科学，爱母亲，爱祖国；他们也关心西班牙的命运……我们看到卓娅在绞架上大骂法西斯匪徒的悲壮的情景，又看到舒拉——这位鹰一样的小伙子，如何怀着复仇的火焰开动坦克去替姐姐报仇，结果他又壮烈地牺牲于反法西斯的斗争中……我们掉下了热泪！
    这时使我们想起了我们祖国的英雄女儿刘胡兰，他们多么相似啊——他们为祖国解放，为全世界劳动人民的解放事业，慷慨地献出了自己青春的生命。他们是怎么样的人呢，奥列格·柯歇伏亦说得好：是“崇高的灵魂”，是优越的社会制度和先进的阶级思想所培养出来的“崇高的灵魂”。
    我们为你有这样英雄不朽的儿女而钦慕；
    我们为自己有这样光辉伟大的榜样而自豪。
    现在美帝国主义的战争贩子们正日日夜夜紧张地演奏着“世界侵略政策的狂燥进行曲”，他们一面在板门店无赖地拖延谈判，一面以罪恶的血手在朝鲜和我国东北撒布细菌瘟疫；他们拼命地武装西德希特勒余孽，疯狂扶植日本法西斯残余，准备挑起新的战争，要想破坏卓娅、舒拉、刘胡兰以及千千万万英雄烈士用热血给我们创造的和平幸福生活。
    我们是世界和平保卫者——中国人民解放军的战士，我们深切地懂得和平幸福生活的意义，也深切地了解保卫这种生活的责任。
    如果战争贩子们敢于向我们进攻，我们为了保卫白发的母亲和红领巾的弟妹们，一定要紧紧地握住枪，和以苏联为首的兄弟国家的和平战士，站在保卫和平斗争的最前哨，给发动战争的敌人以无情的打击。现在我们祖国优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军和英勇的朝鲜人民军正在朝鲜执行着这神圣的任务。
    光荣的敬爱的母亲，为了祖国人民的繁荣，为了全世界人民的幸福，你辛勤地教养了心爱的儿女，又慷慨地献出他们英雄的生命，因此，你不仅是英雄儿女的母亲，也是全世界爱好和平人民共同的母亲，你可以因此而骄傲，也可以因此而得到人们对你的深切的爱戴和对你的无限的尊敬。
    卓娅和舒拉的血不会白流，他们将永远活在我们的心里。她们的英雄榜样将永远会引导和鼓舞全世界千百万劳动青年男女向着更美好的明天大踏步前进！
    再谈吧！
    请你接受我们崇高的革命敬礼！
    并祝你身体健康！
    中国人民解放军某部新民主主义青年团支部全体团员（签名）
    一九五二年八月于南京
    （二）卓娅和舒拉母亲的回信亲爱的中国人民解放军战士们！
    感谢你们热情的来信，感谢你们对我的儿女表示的崇敬以及对我本人的亲切的慰问。
    当我听到我那平凡的作品——关于我心爱的孩子卓娅和舒拉的真实故事——引起你们这样热烈的反应的时候，我感到极大的慰籍和极大的幸福。
    我的孩子们的道路，就是为了自由和幸福献出了自己生命的无数青年英雄们的道路。世界上已有成千的青年男女，为了维护和争取自由幸福，建树了和我的儿女同样的功绩。
    作为母亲来说，我的损失是巨大的；但是我的儿女不是白白牺牲的，他们短促的但是灿烂的生命，鼓舞了其他许许多多为真理和正义的事业而斗争的青年战士。因此，当我意识到这点的时候，我做母亲的心里就充满了应有的骄傲。
    苏联人民热烈地向援助朝鲜人民，和朝鲜人民并肩作战打击美帝国主义侵略者的中国人民志愿军战士们致敬。
    在这个神圣的解放战争中，世界上一切爱好自由与和平的人民是坚决和中朝两国人民站在一起的，他们愤怒地向战争贩子们提出抗议。
    强大的保卫世界和平运动正日益增长和壮大，所有国家的淳朴人民，决不容许侵略者的血腥计划得到实现，一切侵略者都将因为他们的罪行受到严重的惩罚。
    我向你们——为保卫世界和平，为争取祖国繁荣而斗争的英勇的中国人民解放军全体战士致以热烈的母亲的敬礼，同时希望你们在这崇高的斗争中获得成就。全苏联人民也和我一样地这样希望着。
        敬爱你们的留·柯斯莫捷米扬斯卡娅
        一九五二年十二月二十二日于莫斯科（附图片）
