    In order to prepare for the intermediate group study of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", the Central Organs directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the Central Direct Organs Party Committee) and the Organs directly under the Central People's Government of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the Government Party Committee) jointly held a training class for theoretical instructors and counselors, which officially commenced on the 19th of this month.

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on the theoretical education of cadres for 1953-1954, the Central Direct Organs Party Committee and the Government Party Committee, under the guidance and assistance of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, decided to jointly hold the first training class for theoretical instructors and counselors from May 19th to July 19th, a period of two months. To prepare for the study of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" after July, this training class has a total of 536 official students (100 from the Central Direct Organs Party Committee system and 436 from the Government Party Committee system) and 478 auditing students. During the study period, all students, in addition to attending lectures in the Central Direct Organs Party Committee Auditorium, will have their meals, accommodation, reading, and discussions in their original agencies.

    The lecturers already appointed for the training class include Comrades Chen Changhao, Yang Xianzhen, Feng Ding, Wang Boming, etc. To enhance the learning effect and connect it with China's actual situation, the training class has also invited Comrades Xue Muqiao, Yao Yilin, Lü Dong, and Liao Luyan to give special reports on the situation of China's economic work.

    The Party committees and administrative leaders of the various central organs directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to the work of holding the training class for theoretical instructors and counselors and provided strong support and assistance. For example, the leading authorities of the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Heavy Industry not only resolved to transfer cadres with higher political and theoretical levels to serve as full-time or part-time theoretical instructors in the organs and send them to the training class for study, but also the organ Party committees conducted necessary mobilization in advance for the students participating in the training class, asking them to put aside their work, concentrate on studying, and solve specific difficulties in reading and life for them. According to the statistics of the 436 official students registered and reported from the units under the Government Party Committee: cadres at the level of director-general or bureau director account for 3% of the total number of students; cadres at the level of division chief account for 27%; cadres at the level of section chief account for 52%; and cadres at the level of staff member account for 20%. In terms of educational level: 28% have a university degree; 47% have a senior high school degree.

    The teaching policy of the training class particularly emphasizes: first, we must study the theory and experience of socialist economic construction from the study of the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and we must not study the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" as several isolated economic problems in a "supra-historical" and "supra-realistic" way. In the study, we must take the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" as the main reading material, read carefully, and study deeply. Second, the study of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" must proceed from the overall perspective, but at the same time, it must be carried out with emphasis. Third, theory should be linked with practice. In order to strengthen the effect of theoretical study, at the end of each chapter of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", a special person will give a report on China's economic problems, so that students can appropriately connect with China's actual situation.

    In terms of learning methods, the training class emphasizes reading and self-study, and listening to lectures and discussions are only to assist self-study. The official students of the training class must spend eight hours a day concentrating on reading and studying in groups. It is generally stipulated that two group study and discussion meetings should be held for each chapter. The discussion meeting must designate a central speaker and be conducted with leadership and preparation. After each chapter is studied, a group learning summary is carried out to collectively summarize learning experiences and improve the group's learning methods. At the end of the training class, each group is required to write a graduation thesis as an examination.

    Due to the dispersed location of the students' residences, the training class particularly emphasizes the organizational work in the study. Under the leadership of Comrade Gong Zirong, the director of the training class, a training class study office is set up, which is managed by comrades responsible for learning from the Central Direct Organs Party Committee and the Government Party Committee; under this, there are six branch classes, and the directors and deputy directors of the branch classes are designated to be students; under the leadership of the directors and deputy directors of the branch classes, there are three to five study secretaries to assist the directors in handling daily administrative and organizational work in learning; below the branch classes are groups, with group leaders and deputy group leaders. In order to maintain close contact between the training class office and the various branch classes, a liaison officer is sent from the training class study office to each branch class to be responsible for conveying instructions and reflecting situations. There are clear regulations for the responsibilities of everyone from the director of the training class and the study office to the study group leader. All these organizations and regulations are to ensure the completion of the learning task.

    The learning enthusiasm of all the students in the training class is high, but some comrades are afraid that they will not be able to undertake the task of lecturing after returning to their organs. When Comrade Gong Zirong carried out study mobilization on the day of the opening ceremony, he particularly pointed out: "Serving as a theoretical instructor is a glorious and difficult task given to us by the Party. Everyone should be determined to overcome difficulties and complete the glorious task given by the Party." At the same time, he pointed out in response to the ideological situation of some students: "Returning to the organs to serve as theoretical instructors is not fighting alone. There is the support and assistance of the Party organization above; there are the masses to rely on below. As long as everyone follows the mass line and learns from the masses; coupled with personal efforts, difficulties can certainly be overcome."

    The training class is currently carrying out teaching according to the scheduled plan.

### 为中级组学习“联共（布）党史”作好准备  中央一级机关举办理论教员辅导员训练班

    为中级组学习“联共（布）党史”作好准备
    中央一级机关举办理论教员辅导员训练班
    【本报讯】中共中央直属机关委员会（以下简称中直党委）和中共中央人民政府直属机关委员会
    （以下简称政府党委）联合举办的以指导中级组学习“联共（布）党史”为目的的理论教员、辅导员训练班已于本月十九日正式开学。
    自从中共中央发出关于一九五三年——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示以后，中直党委和政府党委在中共中央宣传部的指导和协助下，决定于五月十九日至七月十九日，以两个月的时间，联合举办第一期理论教员、辅导员训练班。为七月份以后学习“联共（布）党史”作好准备，这次训练班共计有正式学员五百三十六名（中直党委系统一百名，政府党委系统四百三十六名）旁听学员四百七十八名。全体学员在学习期间，除上课时在中直党委大礼堂集中听课外，食宿和阅读、讨论都在原机关。
    训练班已经聘定的讲师有：陈昌浩、杨献珍、冯定、王波鸣等同志。为加强学习效果，并联系中国的实际情况，训练班又聘请了薛暮桥、姚依林、吕东、廖鲁言等同志，分别作有关我国经济工作情况的专题报告。
    这次中央各直属机关的党委和行政负责同志对举办理论教员、辅导员训练班的工作都很重视，给予了有力的支持和协助。如中央公安部、中央铁道部、中央重工业部等单位，领导方面不仅下决心抽调政治理论水平较高的干部担任机关专职或兼职理论教员，送来训练班学习，而且机关党委事先对参加训练班学习的学员都进行了必要的动员，要他们放下工作，安心学习，并且为他们解决读书和生活等方面的具体困难。根据目前政府党委所属各单位已注册报到的四百三十六名正式学员的统计：其中司、局长级的干部占总学员数的百分之三；处长级的干部占百分之二十七；科长级的干部占百分之五十二；科员级的干部占百分之二十。学员文化水平：大学程度占百分之二十八；高中程度占百分之四十七。
    训练班的教学方针，特别强调：第一，必须从学习苏联共产党的历史来研究社会主义经济建设的理论和经验，不能“超历史”“超现实”地把“联共（布）党史”的学习当作几个孤立的经济问题来研究。学习中必须以“联共（布）党史”为主要阅读材料，精细阅读，深入钻研。第二，学习“联共（布）党史”必须从全局的观点出发，同时又要有重点地进行学习。第三，理论应联系实际。为了加强理论学习的效果，在“联共（布）党史”每一章学习结束时，都有专人作有关中国经济问题的报告，使学员能够适当地联系中国实际。
    在学习方法方式上，训练班强调读书自修，听讲和讨论只是为了辅助自修。训练班的正式学员每天必须以八个小时的时间，以小组为单位集中阅读和研究。一般规定每学习一章，开两次小组学习讨论会。讨论会必须指定中心发言人，有领导有准备地进行。每章学习完毕，以小组为单位进行学习小结，集体总结学习心得和经验，并改进小组的学习方法，训练班结业时，规定每组必须写一篇毕业论文，作为考试。
    由于学员住地分散，因此训练班特别强调学习中的组织工作。在训练班主任龚子荣同志领导下设训练班学习办公室，由中直党委和政府党委负责管理学习的同志负责；以下设六个分班，分班正副主任指定由学员担任；在分班正副主任领导下有学习秘书三至五人，协助主任办理学习方面的日常行政和组织工作；分班以下为小组，设正副小组长。为了使训练班办公室和各分班之间保持密切联系，每个分班由训练班学习办公室派去联络员一人，负责传达指示和反映情况。从训练班主任、学习办公室到学习小组长的职责，都有简明的规定。所有这些组织和规定，都是为了保证学习任务的完成。
    训练班全体学员的学习情绪很高，但也有些同志怕毕业后回机关担任不了讲课的任务。龚子荣同志在开学那天进行学习动员时，特别指出：担任理论教员是党给予我们的一件光荣而困难的任务，大家应决心克服困难，完成党所给予的光荣任务。同时他又针对某些学员的思想状况指出：“回机关担任理论教员并不是孤军作战，上有党组织的支持和协助；下有群众可依靠，只要大家走群众路线，向群众学习；再加上个人的努力，困难是一定可以克服的。”
    目前训练班已按照预定计划进行教学。
