Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 10th: The Grain Bureau of the Hunan Provincial People's Government and grain and transportation departments at all levels are carrying out a large-scale grain transportation operation. This transportation operation is part of the overall grain adjustment plan of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government. Hunan Province is one of the major grain-producing areas in China and had a bumper harvest last year. In addition to supplying the people of various parts of the province, this grain adjustment will transport a large surplus of grain to basic construction sites and areas in need of grain throughout the country.

The grain collection and transportation work in Hunan began in January of this year, and most of the grain has now been concentrated from the producing areas to areas along transportation lines. Large quantities of rice and polished rice are being shipped out along various rivers, highways, and railways. The transportation plan for January to April has been overfulfilled, and the transportation work is still continuing.

In the transportation work, Hunan Province widely organizes various transportation forces. The grain in Yongming County, at the northern foot of the Wuling Mountains, needs to be organized by laborers to carry it over the mountains to Gongcheng in Guangxi, and then loaded onto wooden boats to be transported to Guilin, and then transported north via the Guiqian Railway. The grain transported from these areas needs to overcome all kinds of difficulties in the thousands of kilometers of long-distance transportation, but the people in various places are enthusiastically participating in the grain transportation work under the slogan of "Supporting National Economic Construction." At present, the province uses 287,000 tons of wooden boats, 21,200 trucks, and more than 8,200 railway cars for grain transportation every day. Thousands upon thousands of people are carrying out heavy transportation work in the spring rain of Jiangnan. The Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau has set up grain handover agencies on various transportation lines, and sent a large number of cadres to participate in the transportation work. The Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government has also sent a working group to the grain transfer locations to supervise and inspect.

    湖南省大量余粮正调运全国需粮地区
    【新华社长沙十日电】湖南省人民政府粮食厅和各级粮食、交通运输部门正在进行一个大规模的粮食调运工作。这次调运工作是中央人民政府粮食部粮食调剂总计划的一部分。湖南省是我国粮食的主要产地之一，去年获得了丰收。这次粮食调剂除供省内各地人民食用外，余粮将大量调运到全国各地基本建设工地和需粮地区。
    湖南粮食集运工作从今年一月即已开始，现在大部分粮食已从产地向交通沿线集中。大量的稻谷、大米正顺着各个河流、公路、铁路线外运。一至四月份调运计划已超额完成，现在调运工作还在继续进行中。
    湖南省在调运工作中，广泛组织各种运输力量。在五岭山脉北麓永明县的粮食，需要组织民工挑过大山运到广西恭城，然后装上木船载运到桂林，再经桂黔铁路北运。从这些地区运出的粮食，需要解决几千公里长途运输中的各种各样的困难，但各地人民在“支援国家经济建设”的口号下，都热烈参加了运粮工作。现在全省每天用于运粮的木船达二十八万七千多吨位，汽车二万一千二百多辆次，火车车皮八千二百余个。成千上万的人们冒着江南的春雨进行繁重的运输工作。湖南省粮食厅在各运输线上设有运粮的交接机构，并派出大批干部参加调运工作，中央人民政府粮食部也派了工作组到调粮地点督促检查。
