    Wanshi City Organs Should Conscientiously Improve the Work of Handling People's Letters and Visits
    Xie Yan writes: In March, under the supervision of the Wanshi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, various organs in Wanshi City, Sichuan Province, conducted an inspection of their work in handling people's letters and visits. The inspection results proved that many units were treating this work with a bureaucratic attitude. The Wanshi Municipal People's Government established a People's Reception Office in August 1951, but it has never been clear who leads it. Sometimes it is led by the Municipal People's Government, and sometimes by the Municipal People's Supervision Committee or the Municipal People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee, effectively becoming leaderless. The Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal People's Government neither processes nor replies to people's letters, simply filing them away. The Municipal People's Court, after forwarding people's letters to the relevant trial divisions, does not urge or handle them, or even if urged, they still do not handle them, leading to a backlog. Many units have not established a system for receiving people and handling their letters; some that have established systems have become mere formalities. For example, the Labor Section and Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal People's Government do not even have simple registration procedures. Although the Municipal People's Reception Office has systems for numbering, forwarding, urging, and replying, in fact, it only plays the role of a "transfer station," considering its task completed once the people's letters are forwarded. The masses, such as Lu Zhanyun, who participated in the Xinhai Revolution, requested to participate in work or receive relief due to financial difficulties. In April 1951, he wrote a letter to the Secretariat of the Municipal People's Government, which was backlogged for one year and nine months without being processed. It was not until January 26 this year that the office forwarded the letter to the Labor Section of the Municipal People's Government. The Labor Section did not process it but returned it to the office. The office then forwarded the letter to the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee. On February 29, the United Front Work Department forwarded it to the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal People's Government. In total, it was delayed and forwarded for twenty-three months without being processed. The Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee also does not urge or inspect the handling of people's letters after forwarding them; they have no idea whether the issues raised by the people have been answered. Many units have put up suggestion boxes on the streets, but most of them have also become mere formalities. The Second Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau only checked the suggestion box in early February this year after it was put up during the "Three-Anti" campaign, discovering many letters inside. Due to sun and rain, they had rotted into a pile and could not be identified. The suggestion box of the Fourth Police Station of the bureau has become a beehive. The suggestion box of the Third Police Station of the bureau has been stolen without them knowing. How serious is this bureaucratic situation! I believe that in the future, all organs in Wanshi City must strengthen leadership, establish and improve systems, designate specific personnel to be responsible for the work of handling people's letters and visits, and earnestly correct past practices.

### 万县市各机关应切实改进对待人民来信来访工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    万县市各机关应切实改进对待人民来信来访工作
    谢焱来信：三月间，四川省万县市各机关，在中共万县市委督促下，对处理人民来信、来访工作作了一次检查。检查结果，证明许多单位都是用官僚主义态度对待这一工作。万县市人民政府，自一九五一年八月起成立了人民接待室，但属谁领导的，直到现在还不明确。有时，它是市人民政府领导，有时又是市人民监察委员会或市各界人民代表会议协商委员会领导，实际变成了无人领导。市人民政府民政科，对人民来信既不处理也不答复，归档完事。市人民法院，把人民来信转给有关审判庭后，不催不办，或催了也不办，造成积压现象。许多单位都没有建立接待人民和处理人民来信的制度；有的虽然建立了，但也流于形式。如市人民政府劳动科、民政科，就是连简而易行的登记手续都没有。市人民接待室，虽有编号、转办、催办、答复等制度，事实上也只起了“转运站”的作用，把人民来信转出去了，就算完成任务了。群众卢占云，曾参加过辛亥革命，因生活困难，要求参加工作或救济，于一九五一年四月间写信给市人民政府秘书处，被积压了一年零九个月都没有处理。今年一月二十六日，该处才把这封信转给市人民政府劳动科。劳动科未作处理，转回该处。该处又把信转给市委统战部。二月二十九日，市委统战部再转给市人民政府民政科。共拖延、照转了二十三个月，还没有处理。市委秘书处对人民来信的处理，也是转出后既不催办也不检查；对人民提出的问题是否得到答复，他们心中根本无数。各单位在街道上挂了不少意见箱，但大部分也都流于形式。市人民政府公安局第二派出所，在“三反”时挂出意见箱后，直到今年二月初才检查一次，发现里面有很多信件，因日晒雨淋，已经烂成一团，无法辨认了。该局第四派出所的意见箱已经成了蜜蜂窝。该局第三派出所的意见箱，已被偷走还不知道。这种官僚主义情况是何等严重！我认为今后万县市各机关对待人民来信、来访工作，必须加强领导、建立和健全制度、指定专人负责，切实纠正过去的作风。
