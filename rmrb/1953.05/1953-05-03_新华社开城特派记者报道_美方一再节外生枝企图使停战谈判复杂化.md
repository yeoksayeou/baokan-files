New China News Agency Kaesong Special Dispatch:
    The U.S. Side Repeatedly Raises Extraneous Issues in an Attempt to Complicate the Armistice Negotiations
    [New China News Agency, Kaesong, 1st dispatch] Our agency’s special correspondent reports: Harrison’s insulting remarks about whether Asian countries can be considered neutral countries explain why the armistice negotiations have made no progress in the six days since General Nam Il proposed a six-point suggestion for resolving the entire prisoner-of-war issue.

    At a liaison officers’ meeting held shortly before the delegation meeting on the morning of the 1st, Daniel, the chief liaison officer of the U.S. side, suddenly fabricated a claim that the Korean and Chinese sides still needed to repatriate 234 non-Korean wounded and sick prisoners of war and 141 Korean wounded and sick prisoners of war. General Li Sang-cho told Daniel that his demands were "baseless and can only be regarded as deliberate slander." All sick and wounded prisoners of war, except those who are unfit to travel as stipulated in the Geneva Convention, have already been repatriated. In fact, the Korean and Chinese sides have already repatriated 63 more non-Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war and 21 more Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war than estimated.

    Observers pointed out that Daniel's raising of extraneous issues immediately after Harrison's insult to Asian countries was clearly intended to complicate the armistice negotiations.

    Harrison did not retract his insulting remarks on the 1st about nominating an Asian country as a mutually agreed-upon neutral country. At the same time, he insisted on proposing a specific neutral country before the mission of the neutral country had been agreed upon.

    General Nam Il told him: "Our side fully agrees that the countries composing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which both sides have agreed to, are neutral countries." However, he pointed out that the current issue is to nominate a neutral country to which to send those prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated. Out of respect for the neutral countries, the issue of nominating specific neutral countries cannot be discussed until the mission of the neutral countries—namely, sending those prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to the neutral country to be cared for by it—has been agreed upon.

    Harrison's deliberate insistence on the nomination of neutral countries is obviously to cover up the fact that the armistice negotiations have made no progress for six days because he has not responded in any way to all the efforts made by General Nam Il to keep the door open for negotiations; not only has he not done so, but he has also insulted Asian countries and created various excuses for not resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. It is very clear from the delegation meetings of the past six days that the U.S. representative has not made any corresponding efforts to the major efforts made by the Korean and Chinese sides to resume armistice negotiations and resolve the entire prisoner-of-war issue.

    In fact, Harrison attempted to push the armistice negotiations backwards by demanding that Korean prisoners of war be handed over to the Syngman Rhee government with the claim that they should be "released in South Korea without further delay." General Nam Il pointed out that this was a "retrogressive step" because such release of un-repatriated prisoners of war within the territory of the detaining side violates the principle agreed upon by both sides: that they should be sent to a neutral country for a fair resolution of the issue of their repatriation.

    In addition to the U.S. side's opposition to sending the remaining prisoners of war to a neutral country—where they could be free from the influence of the detaining side—the demand to hand over Korean prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee government reveals the U.S. side's aim of preventing prisoners of war from returning home and to their homeland, and of permanently exiling them.

    As General Nam Il explained: "Only in a neutral country outside the Korean battlefield can prisoners of war gradually break free from the effects of prolonged detention, return to a normal state, and happily return to their homeland and hometown." He pointed out that allowing prisoners of war to happily return to their homeland and hometown is the most humane approach. Depriving them of the opportunity to do so is the most inhumane. But the U.S. representative continues to insist on restricting this opportunity.

    Although Harrison has adopted this non-negotiating attitude, General Nam Il once again declared that, in order to achieve the armistice in Korea that the world desires, our side is still prepared to negotiate with the U.S. side in a spirit of mutual reconciliation and joint effort. However, as observers have pointed out, progress can only be achieved if both sides make concessions, and so far the U.S. representative has not shown this in action.

    美方一再节外生枝企图使停战谈判复杂化
    【新华社开城一日电】　本社特派记者报道：哈利逊所发表的关于亚洲国家能否作为一个中立国家的侮辱性的言论，说明为什么在南日大将提出解决整个战俘问题的六点建议以后的六天中，停战谈判一直没有进展。
    一日早晨在代表团大会以前不久举行的联络组会议上，美方联络组首席组员丹尼尔突然无中生有地说朝中方面还必须遣返二百三十四名非朝鲜籍病伤俘虏和一百四十一名朝鲜籍病伤俘虏。李相朝将军对丹尼尔说，他的要求是“毫无根据的，并且只能被认为是一种蓄意的诽谤。”一切病伤战俘，除了那些如日内瓦公约中所规定的不宜旅行的以外，都已经被遣返了。事实上朝中方面已经比估计数字多遣返了六十三名非朝鲜籍病伤战俘和二十一名朝鲜籍病伤战俘。
    观察家指出：刚刚在哈利逊侮辱亚洲国家以后丹尼尔又来节外生枝，显然是要使停战谈判复杂化。
    哈利逊一日并没有收回他的关于提名一个亚洲国家作为双方同意的中立国的侮辱性的言论。同时，他又坚持要在中立国的任务还没有获得协议以前就提出一个具体的中立国来。
    南日大将告诉他说：“我方完全同意组成双方已经协议的中立国监察委员会的国家都是中立国家”。不过他指出说，目前的问题是：要提名一个把那些未被直接遣返的战俘送到它那里去的中立国。为了表示对于中立国的尊重起见，关于中立国的任务——即把那些未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国那里去由它看管——还没有获得协议以前，对于具体的中立国的提名问题是不能讨论的。
    哈利逊故意坚持关于中立国的提名，显然是为了掩饰这样的事实：六天以来停战谈判之所以没有进展，是因为他没有对南日大将为了使谈判之门敞开而作的一切努力给予任何回答；他不但没有这样做，反而侮辱亚洲国家，并且制造不去解决战俘问题的各种藉口。从六天以来的代表团大会上可以很明显的看出一个突出的事实：对于朝中方面在恢复停战谈判和解决整个战俘问题上所作的重大努力，美方代表丝毫也没有作相应的努力。
    事实上，哈利逊曾试图用朝鲜战俘“在南朝鲜释放，不再拖延”的说法要求把朝鲜战俘交给李承晚政府，来把停战谈判拖向后退，南日大将指出这是
    一个“倒退的步骤”，因为这种就在拘留一方的地区内释放未被直接遣返的战俘，违犯了双方所同意的原则：应当把他们送交一个中立国以便公正地解决有关遣返他们的问题。
    除了美方反对把下余的战俘送交中立国——他们可以在该地免受拘留一方的影响——外，又加上这种把朝鲜战俘交给李承晚政府的要求，就显露出美方阻止战俘回家、回祖国，并使他们永久流放的目的。
    正如南日大将所说明的：“只有在朝鲜战场以外的一个中立国家里，战俘才能逐渐解脱长期拘留的影响，恢复正常的状态，欣然返回祖国和家乡。”他指出：使战俘欣然返回祖国和家乡，是最人道的办法。使他们没有机会这样做，才是最不人道的。但是美方代表继续坚持限制这种机会。
    虽然哈利逊采取了这种非协商的态度，然而南日大将再一次声明：为了实现举世渴望的朝鲜停战，我方仍然准备本着互相和解和共同努力的精神与美方进行协商。但是，如观察家们所指出的，要获得进展，必须要双方都让步才行，而迄今美方代表还没有以行动来表现这一点。
