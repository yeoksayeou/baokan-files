Joint Notice from the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives:
"1605" Pesticide to be Used Concentratedly, General Promotion to be Stopped

The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives issued a joint notice on the 22nd, requiring all localities to concentrate the use of the highly toxic "1605" pesticide and stop general promotion to prevent poisoning and accidental injuries. The units designated for concentrated use of "1605" pesticide are agricultural experiment and research institutions, agricultural colleges, agricultural technical schools, state-owned farms, provincial farms, special district farms, county farms with technical conditions, cotton pest control demonstration areas, and well-established technical guidance stations. These units can purchase "1605" pesticide from local cooperatives based on actual needs with a formal letter. This pesticide is to be used specifically for the control of cotton aphids and cotton spider mites. When using it, technical cadres must supervise, and workers and farmers must not be allowed to use it independently to prevent poisoning and death. Both cooperatives and user units must store "1605" pesticide separately in dry, sun-proof and rain-proof rooms or cabinets, strictly preventing air leakage, and assign a dedicated person to be responsible for management and inspection. "1605" pesticide delivered by farmers to the cooperatives will be purchased by the cooperatives at the original price. In any locality where poisoning accidents occur due to failure to comply with the regulations, responsibility shall be investigated.

    中央农业部、全国合作总社联合通知
    “一六○五”农药要集中使用停止一般推销
    中央人民政府农业部、中华全国合作社联合总社在二十二日发出联合通知，要各地对含有剧毒的“一六○五”农药集中使用，停止一般推销，以防止中毒误伤事件。集中使用“一六○五”农药的单位，规定为农业试验研究机关、农学院、农业技术学校、国营农场、省农场、专区农场、具备技术条件的县农场、棉虫防治示范区和基础较好的技术指导站。这些单位可以根据实际需要，备具正式函件，向当地合作社购买“一六○五”农药。这种农药仅专门用来防治棉蚜和棉蜘蛛。使用时必须由技术干部加以掌握，不得听凭工人、农民自行使用，以防中毒死亡。不论合作社或使用单位，都必须把“一六○五”农药单独锁存在干燥而不受日晒雨漏的屋内或柜橱内，严防漏气，并指定专人负责管理、检查。农民交到合作社的“一六○五”农药，由合作社照价收购。各地凡不按照规定认真办理而发生中毒事故，应追究责任。
