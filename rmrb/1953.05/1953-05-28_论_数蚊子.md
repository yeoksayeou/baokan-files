    On "Counting Mosquitoes"
    Yan Xiu
    Not long ago, a very high-level health administrative organ, under a terribly grand name, issued an instruction to the whole country, saying that the statistical units for mosquitoes, flies, etc., eliminated in the past health campaigns were not "scientific." From now on, when calculating these figures, all localities should use "scientific" units, and "mosquitoes, flies, larvae, pupae, etc., should all be counted individually." This "instruction" was issued in a grand manner to the leading organs of the Party, government, and army in major administrative regions across the country, and was to be forwarded to all localities.
    This is very much like a joke created by a highly skilled person, and also like an unprecedented oddity in the history of science; but this is a real thing, and the instruction was sent by express telegram!
    May I ask the person who issued the instruction: When you spray "DDT" at home, how do you "scientifically" count the "number" of mosquitoes and flies you eliminate? Also, how many "larvae" have you eliminated in the water, and what "scientific" method do you have to count their "number"? Also, when I write this short article, I also "eliminate" a lot of mosquitoes, but I forgot to count the "number," what should I do? ... According to your instructions, even if all the people in the country are mobilized without exception to do nothing but "count mosquitoes" for you, they will not be able to complete your task!
    The person who issued such instructions has obviously lost all reason. If they continue to do so, after a few more full meals, they will probably count how many hairs are on the heads of the people in the country, or how many weeds are on the ground.
    Chairman Mao once said something extremely earnest in his speech "Oppose Party Formalism": "Party formalism is also a kind of foreign formalism. Lu Xun had long opposed this foreign formalism. Why do we also call it Party formalism? This is because, in addition to its foreignness, it also has a bit of local flavor. It can also be considered a creation! Who says our people have no creation at all? This is one! (Laughter)" It is distressing that these kinds of "creations" satirized by Chairman Mao have greatly increased in many of our works today - isn't the "counting mosquitoes" leadership a double product of this kind of "creation"?
    In fact, the joke of "counting mosquitoes" is not the only one. There are many such "leaders" in the same department and other departments. It is not enough to regard them as just a joke; they must first be regarded as a very heavy pain in the process of national construction.
    Why can this kind of thing be approved from the drafter level, level by level, and then be approved down level by level, and flow to the whole country in a grand manner to poison the people? This shows how deeply the problem of bureaucracy has permeated many of our institutions, and the condition is so serious that some patients are already in a state of unconsciousness.
    However, in the past, we have not sufficiently encouraged people to hate such people and such things! So that they can still live as veritable muddleheads. Is it okay for people not to hate them in the future? No! The responsibility of building our country cannot be handed over to such muddleheads!
    Lenin's righteous indignation towards such people and such things is a good example for us to learn from. For example, in the political report of the Central Committee at the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1922, Lenin used a full four thousand words to scold the then People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the Moscow Consumer Cooperative for a bureaucratic example in a purchase of French canned goods. At that time, Moscow was under the serious threat of hunger, and canned goods were waiting to be transported at the dock; but these agencies did not know what they were busy with, and could not solve the problem. Finally, the Central Political Bureau of the Party learned about it, made a decision, and then bought the goods. Lenin said: "Why, in the capital of the Soviet Republic three years after the revolution, do we need two investigations and the participation of Kamenev and Krasin and the instructions of the Political Bureau to buy some canned goods? What is lacking? Power? No. Money has also been found, there is both economic power and political power. All agencies are working. What is lacking? That is, 99% of the staff of the Moscow Consumer Cooperative (I do not object to them at all, and I think they are all good communists) and 99% of the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Trade lack cultural talent - they cannot handle business accurately.
    "When I first heard about this, I wrote a written proposal to the Central Committee: In my opinion, except for the members of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee
    (these members, you know, are inviolable), except for these people, all the staff in Moscow agencies should be put in the worst prison in Moscow for six hours, and the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Trade should be imprisoned for thirty-six hours. But now no one guilty has been found. In fact, from what I have said, it is obvious that no criminals can be found. It is simply due to the usual Russian intellectual's inability to do practical things, and is chaotic." According to the spirit of Lenin's proposal, what kind of punishment should our respectable agencies and personnel related to the "counting mosquitoes" affair receive?
    Lenin said extremely sarcastically: "This kind of work is not acceptable. This is neither new, nor economic, nor policy, but simply a big joke." What a great satire and education this is for us! Many of our things today are many times more serious than the examples that Lenin scolded. To use Lenin's words to describe such arrangements and leadership work as "counting mosquitoes" is: "This is neither large-scale, nor planned, nor economic, nor construction, but simply a big joke."
    "This kind of work is not acceptable." - Firmly remember Lenin's warning like a great bell! Let such "creations" as "counting mosquitoes" be thoroughly eliminated like eliminating flies and mosquitoes with the principle and clarity of communists!

    论“数蚊子”
    严秀
    不久以前，有一个很高级的卫生行政机关，曾用一个大得可怕的名义，发了一个指示给全国，说过去卫生运动中各地所消灭的蚊蝇等等的统计单位不“科学”，今后在统计这项数字时，要各地以“科学”的单位计算，“蚊、蝇、孑孓、蝇蛹等一律要以个数计”。这个“指示”是堂哉皇哉地发给全国各大行政区的党、政府和军队的领导机关，并要转发到各地去的。
    这很像一个技术高超的人编造出来的笑话，也很像世界科学史上一个前所未有的奇谈；但这是真真实实的事情，指示还用的是加急电报哩！
    请问发指示的人：府上喷射“滴滴涕”时，你是如何“科学”地统计你所消灭的蚊蝇的“个数”的？还有，在水里消灭了多少“孑孓”，你又有什么“科学”方法可以统计它的“个数”呢？还有，我在写这篇短文时，也“消灭”了不少蚊子，但忘记了统计“个数”，又如何办呢？……按照你们的指示，把全国人民一个不漏地全部动员起来，百事不干专替你们去“数蚊子”也完不成你们的任务呀！
    发出这样指示的人，显然是失掉了任何的理智了。照他们这样干下去，大概再饱食几餐之后，就要统计全国人民的头发有多少根，或者地上的杂草有多少棵了。
    毛主席在“反对党八股”的讲演中曾经说过一段极为语重心长的话，他说：“党八股也就是一种洋八股。这洋八股，鲁迅早就反对过的。我们为什么又叫它做党八股呢？这是因为它除了洋气之外，还有一点土气。也算一个创作吧！谁说我们的人一点创作也没有呢？这就是一个！（大笑）”令人痛心的，是毛主席所讽刺的这类“创作”，在今天我们的很多工作中是大大地多起来了，——“数蚊子”的领导不就是这类“创作”中的一种双料出品么？
    事实上，“数蚊子”这样的笑话，并不是唯一的一个。像这样的“领导”，在同一部门及其他部门中还很多。光把它们看成一件笑话是不行的，还必须首先把它们看成是在国家建设过程中一种很沉重的痛苦。
    这种事情为什么竟能从起草人一级一级地批上去，又一级一级地批下来，堂而皇之地流毒全国呢？这就说明官僚主义的毛病在我们的不少的机构里是已经如何地浸透了，病情严重，以至有些病人是已经处于不省人事的状态了。
    但是，过去我们鼓励人们起来仇恨这样的人和这样的事是太不够了！以至他们还可以作为一个名符其实的糊涂虫而活下去。今后人们对他们不仇恨行不行呢？不行！建设我们国家的责任，是不能交给这样的糊涂虫啊！
    列宁对于这样的人和这样的事所抱的那种正气磅礴的义愤，是我们学习的好榜样。举一个例子。列宁在一九二二年三月俄国共产党（布）第十一次代表大会上所作中央委员会底政治报告中，用了整整四千字去责骂当时对外贸易人民委员部和莫斯科消费合作社在一次购买法国罐头事件中的官僚主义的例子。当时莫斯科处在饥饿的严重威胁中，罐头等在码头待运；但这些机关不知道在忙些什么，不能解决问题，最后党的中央政治局知道了，做了决定，才买了这批东西。列宁说：“为什么在革命后三年的苏维埃共和国首都，为了买点罐头，还要经过两次调查，还须有加米涅夫和克拉辛参加以及政治局的指令呢？究竟缺乏什么呢？政权么？不是的。钱也找到了，既有经济权力，也有政治权力。一切机关全在工作。究竟缺乏什么呢？就是莫斯科消费协社中百分之九十九的工作人员（我丝毫也不反对他们，并认为他们都是很好的共产党员）以及对外贸易部百分之九十九的工作人员缺乏文化才干，——他们不能精确地来处理业务。
    “当我初次听到这件事情，我就向中央写了一个书面提议：据我的意见，除全俄中央执委会委员外
    （这些委员，你们知道，是不可侵犯的），除了这些人外，要把莫斯科各机关中的全体工作人员都放到莫斯科最坏的监牢里禁闭六个钟头，而对外贸易部的工作人员，则禁闭三十六个钟头。那知现在却没找着一个有罪的人。其实从我所讲述的这中间，很显然是找不出罪犯来的。简单是由于通常俄国知识分子式的不善于实际作事，杂乱无章罢了。”依照列宁的这个提议的精神，我们那些可敬的与“数蚊子”事情有关的机关和人员，应该受到什么样的责罚呢？
    列宁极端辛辣地说：“这样工作是不行的。这既不是新，也不是经济，也不是政策，而简直是一场大笑话。”这对于我们是一个多么大的讽刺和教育！我们今天不少的事情，比列宁所责骂的例子不知要严重多少倍。像“数蚊子”这样的布置和领导工作，用列宁的话来说，这就是：“这既不是大规模，也不是有计划，不是经济，更不是建设，而简直是一场大笑话。”
    “这样工作是不行的。”——紧紧地记住列宁的这一句像洪钟一样的警告吧！让“数蚊子”这样的
    “创作”像消灭苍蝇蚊子一样地把它用共产党人的原则性、明确性所彻底消灭吧！
