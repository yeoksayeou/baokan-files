    On the Basis of Mobilizing the Masses to Discuss Plans,
    Shenyang Smelter Inspects Plan Management Situation
    Preparing to Further Strengthen Plan Management Work
    Shenyang Smelter inspected the past execution of plan management and, according to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, prepared to further strengthen plan management.

    The smelter mobilized workers to discuss and formulate production plans, which concluded by the end of March. During the discussion, the masses were fully mobilized, and advanced production plans were formulated. However, in the early stages, due to insufficient understanding by the factory's leading cadres, the mobilization of workers to discuss plans was not combined with further strengthening plan management. After the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Factory and Mine Directors' Conference, the smelter's leading cadres deeply recognized this problem and immediately organized personnel to go deep into the workshops to inspect the past execution of plan management.

    Over the past few years, the smelter's workers have done a lot of work in plan management: they have established original records and have relatively advanced technical and economic norms; since February of this year, they have established and implemented operation plans, enabling balanced production on a ten-day basis. However, this inspection still revealed that the factory had many shortcomings in plan management. For example, some original records were incomplete, inaccurate, and not recorded in a timely manner. Some major tasks did not have norms, and those with norms fluctuated greatly. For example, from January to February, more than 165 tons of lead were lost in smelting lead wire. Because there were no records and norms for smoke dust lead content (i.e., the amount of lead lost with the smoke during smelting), it was impossible to investigate how these lead losses occurred. Another example is the grade of copper matte in the copper blast furnace, which fluctuated greatly from April 1st to 6th, reaching as high as 42.29 percent and as low as 37.9 percent. In addition, the materials section, finance section, and repair department did not conduct good analysis and research on material consumption norms and reserve norms, cost and financial norms, and repair norms. The inspection also found that the content of some workshop operation plans was not practical or complete enough, and many workshop operation plans were not submitted to workers for discussion. In the copper matte blowing workshop, the actual recovery rate of copper, on one occasion, the team plan had set a target of 90 percent, while the operation plan only included 89 percent. Some workshops' April operation plans lacked equipment maintenance, power supply, and major raw material consumption norms.

    After inspecting the past execution of plan management, the smelter's leading cadres resolved to vigorously mobilize the masses in the second quarter to further expose past problems in plan management and establish and improve plan management. The central requirement is to improve norm management and original records, focus on key links to establish norms, create operation plans and production instruction charts, improve the supply work of the materials department, and ultimately achieve rhythmic and balanced production on a daily and ten-day basis, ensuring increased metal recovery rates. Under this requirement, it was also specifically proposed that in the second quarter, in terms of norm management, 29 new norms related to metal recovery rates should be established, and a sound norm management system should be established, ensuring that each norm has a dedicated person responsible for it and that norms are analyzed once every ten days, etc. In terms of original records, 29 new original records for new norms should be established, and 15 new technical operation records should be established; the management system for original records should be strengthened, ensuring that each workshop, team, and group has a dedicated person responsible for each type of record, correcting unscientific recording methods, and establishing the inspection and analysis of original records. In terms of operation plans, it is required that each time before making an operation plan, the previous month's original records, technical operation records, and norm completion should be analyzed, measures to overcome difficulties and increase production should be proposed, workers should be mobilized to discuss, and production instruction charts should be compiled according to the operation plan.

    Currently, the smelter is carrying out the following preparatory work before strengthening plan management: First, enhancing cadres' understanding of strengthening plan management. Some cadres still believe that "plan management is scientific, workers do not understand it, and it has little to do with workers," and "plan management requires technical personnel to prevent random work." Some generally know the importance of strengthening plan management, but do not know how to strengthen it, or are unclear about the interrelationships between original records, norm management, and operation plans. To this end, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, cadres are organized to study strengthening plan management in a planned manner. Initially, cadres above the level of section chief and workshop director are organized to participate first. During the study, each person is required to carefully read the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry on strengthening plan management, the People's Daily editorial on establishing and improving plan management, and relevant documents on operation plans and original records. On Wednesday and Saturday afternoons each week, special personnel are organized to give special reports on plan management to everyone. In addition, everyone is organized to link their own ideological understanding with the factory's specific situation of past plan management to conduct discussions. Second, conducting key pilot work on strengthening plan management. Under the personal leadership of the factory director and the Party Committee secretary, two key pilot work groups were formed to conduct key pilot work targeting the lead electrolysis and copper matte blowing workshops. Third, mobilizing section and office personnel to do a good job in technical and system preparations related to plan management, such as studying and drafting original record management systems and norm management systems.

    在发动群众讨论计划的基础上
    沈阳冶炼厂检查计划管理情况
    为进一步加强计划管理的工作进行准备
    沈阳冶炼厂检查了过去执行计划管理的情况，并按照中央重工业部的指示，准备进一步加强计划管理工作。
    冶炼厂发动职工讨论制定生产计划，到三月底便结束了。讨论中，充分发动了群众，制定了先进的生产计划。但在初期，由于厂的领导干部的认识不够，未把发动职工群众讨论计划和进一步加强计划管理结合进行。在重工业部厂矿长会议后，冶炼厂领导干部深刻认识到这一问题，当即组织人员深入车间，检查过去计划管理执行的情况。
    几年来，冶炼厂职工在计划管理方面，做了不少工作：建立了原始纪录，有了比较先进的技术经济定额；从今年二月开始，建立并实行了作业计划，做到可以按旬进行均衡生产。但是，在这次检查中，仍发现该厂在计划管理工作上存在不少缺点。例如部分原始纪录有不全、不确、记载不及时的缺点。有些主要的工作还没有定额，有定额的，也高低波动很大。如从一、二两月，熔炼铅丝统共损失了铅一六五吨多，因没有烟尘合铅量（即铅在熔炼中随烟跑掉的数量）等纪录和定额，这些铅究竟是如何损失的，无法查考。又如铜鼓风炉冰铜的品位，从四月一日到六日，高时达到百分之四十二点二九，低时只达到百分之三十七点九，波动很大。此外材料科、财务科、修理部，都未把材料消耗定额和储备定额，成本财务定额、检修定额等加以很好的分析研究。在检查中，同时发现有些车间作业计划的内容，不够切合实际和完整，且有许多车间的作业计划，未交给职工讨论。真吹炉车间铜的实收率，有一次，小组计划已订出要达到百分之九十，而作业计划内却只编上百分之八十九。有的车间，四月份的作业计划，还缺乏设备检修、动力供应、主要原材料消耗定额。
    检查了过去执行计划管理的情况后，冶炼厂领导干部决心要在第二季度大力发动职工群众，进一步揭发过去计划管理上的问题，建立健全计划管理。中心要求是要做到在改进定额管理和原始纪录的基础上，在关键环节作好定额，做好作业计划和生产指示图表，并改善材料部门的供应工作，最终达到按日、按旬进行有节奏的均衡生产，保证提高金属实收率。在这要求下，又具体提出，在第二季度内，在定额管理方面，要建立有关金属实收率的新定额二十九种，要健全定额管理制度，做到每项定额有专人负责，每旬分析一次定额等。在原始纪录方面，要建立新设定额的原始纪录二十九种，建立新的技术操作纪录十五种；加强原始纪录的管理制度，做到每车间、班、组每种纪录都有专人负责，纠正不科学的纪录方法，建立原始纪录的检查、分析工作。在作业计划方面，要求每当做作业计划前，必须分析上月原始纪录、技术操作纪录、定额完成的情况，提出克服困难提高生产的措施，动员职工讨论，按照作业计划，编生产指示图表。
    目前，冶炼厂正在进行下述加强计划管理前的准备工作：第一、提高干部对加强计划管理的认识。目前还有些干部认为：“计划管理是科学的，工人不懂，和工人关系不大”，“计划管理是要技术人员不要乱干。”有的虽笼统地知道加强计划管理的重要，但不知应如何加强，或对原始纪录、定额管理、作业计划三者的互相关系不明。为此，便在党委会统一领导下，有计划地组织干部进行加强计划管理的学习。开始是先组织科长、车间主任以上的干部参加。学习中，指定每人必须认真阅读重工业部关于加强计划管理的指示，人民日报建立健全计划管理的社论，及有关作业计划、原始纪录等文件。每星期三、六两下午，并组织专人向大家作计划管理的专题报告。此外，还组织大家联系自己的思想认识，和该厂过去计划管理的具体情况进行座谈、讨论。第二、进行加强计划管理的重点试验工作。在厂长和党委会书记亲自带领下，组成两个重点试验工作组，以铅电解、真吹炉车间为对象进行重点试验。第三、发动科、室人员，做好有关计划管理的技术和制度方面的准备工作，如研究起草原始纪录管理制度、定额管理制度等。
