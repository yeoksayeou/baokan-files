    Everything Here Belongs to the Children
    ——A Record of the Zhdanov Pioneer Palace in Leningrad
    Soviet Union  Yi·Guolowen
    On the bank of the Fontanka River in Leningrad, there is a row of beautiful and orderly columns, and behind the columns are two heavy iron gates... This is the entrance to the Zhdanov Pioneer Palace. From the open gate, you can see the vast courtyard inside, flower beds blooming with various flowers, and many pigeons tamed by the children, walking around carelessly on the asphalt paths and flower beds.
    In the era of Tsarist Russia, this was the residence of Russian princes and nobles. In the magnificent halls, splendid reception rooms and ballrooms were designated for the dignitaries of St. Petersburg. The Great October Revolution returned this beautiful palace to the working people. The Soviet government decided to give this palace to the children of Leningrad. There could be no better gift. There are a total of two hundred and fifty rooms in the palace, with quiet reading rooms, beautiful living rooms, elegant halls... But everything here needed to be rearranged and equipped to fully suit the requirements and hobbies of the new little masters.
    Scholars, sculptors, artists, and teachers from Leningrad all participated in this work. They tried their best to come up with the most beneficial, beautiful, and attractive things for the children. They actively engaged in sculpting, wallpapering, electrical work, and various decorative fine work. Later, on a sunny day, trucks drove into the courtyard one after another, bringing special equipment and utensils manufactured by Leningrad factories for the reading rooms, laboratories, and happy game rooms. There were small ships, airplanes, entire small railways, real lathes, radios, film equipment, and so on.
    On the opening day of the Pioneer Palace, representatives from various factories in Leningrad were sent. At the gate, the bright red flag of the Pioneers was raised amidst the majestic sound of trumpets and drums, and tens of thousands of happy children walked into the courtyard. The stairs, corridors, and halls were filled with joyful people...
    More than ten years have passed since that day. According to rough statistics, hundreds of thousands of children have come to the Pioneer Palace over the years to participate in various group activities, Pioneer bonfires, lectures, and evening parties. During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, Leningrad was surrounded by the enemy, and the Pioneer Palace suffered bombing and shelling. Only during this short period did the reading rooms and laboratories in the Pioneer Palace remain silent for a while.
    Today, in the two hundred and fifty rooms of the Leningrad Pioneer Palace, a friendly and joyful life is boiling. Anyone who has visited this bright and happy paradise for children cannot help but recall the words of Comrade Zhdanov, an outstanding activist of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the direct caregiver and participant in the construction of this Pioneer Palace: "Under the sunshine of Stalin, the talents and abilities of children blossom like flowers in a beautiful garden." Here, any interest of children can be satisfied, and all their talents can be developed, because everything is prepared for them here.
    Many guests have visited the Leningrad Pioneer Palace. People from other cities often come here to sightsee. And now, people from other countries have also come. It takes several hours to visit the living rooms decorated by excellent sculptors and artists, the quiet laboratories, and various activity places. This kind of visit often excites every adult, making them feel happy and excited too. Once, a Scandinavian workers' delegation came here. When a Swedish worker wanted to say a few words to the children surrounding him, his eyes suddenly became moist.
    "I am crying because of happiness and pain," he later said, "Our children, and when I was young, all read Andersen's fairy tales. Only in fairy tales did we read about palaces, and we only dreamed about these in our humble huts, and we were also sure that these palaces only existed in fairy tales, and we would never truly step into the threshold of these wonderful palaces. Therefore, I am excited and moved to tears for your happiness, and at the same time, I am sad that our children do not yet know about this situation..."
    Usually, a visit to the Pioneer Palace starts with the art education hall on the right side of the gate. As you go up the stairs, you will immediately feel as if you are in the backstage of a huge musical theater: the curtain is about to rise, and the music performance is about to begin! From one art room came the sound of booming drums, in another art room violins were playing lively tunes, in another room someone was loudly reciting poetry, and others were singing in unison, and in the hall, a group of girls were dancing a graceful dance. The sound of the piano could be heard faintly... All these sounds merged into a somewhat uneven tone, just like the scene before the opening of a musical.
    There is also a gymnasium here, specially for the children's sports school attached to the Pioneer Palace. There are a total of two thousand five hundred students in various departments of the school. Some people like to play football, others play chess, some want to ski, some have a strong interest in riding motorcycles, some swim, fence, box... In short, it is difficult to list them all. The teachers at this sports school are all famous athletes from Leningrad. Every winter, a small ice rink specially for children is equipped in the garden of the Pioneer Palace. When the residents of Leningrad walk past the fence near the garden, they always stop to admire the little skaters—sometimes they draw a circle on the ice, and sometimes they do some complicated toe-spinning movements... Opposite the art hall is the technology hall—one of the most interesting places in the Pioneer Palace. The technology hall has three floors and includes forty-eight specialized laboratories in various technical departments. Everything here is to enable children to acquire broad knowledge of modern technology: the laboratories are equipped with various instruments, tools, machine tools, and ship models, airplane models, as well as radios, radiotelegraphs, etc., that enable children to make anything they want.
    The children spent a lot of labor and energy to create a "Pioneer" image transmission machine, which won the second prize at the All-Soviet Radio Image Transmission Machine Exhibition in 1951. Young technology enthusiasts used wood, metal, and cardboard to create various physical teaching materials for the school. The work carried out in the photography laboratory, which occupies several rooms, is also very interesting. Many elementary school students and visitors to this laboratory have become skilled photographers. They have a good grasp of color photography technology, and some of their works have become decorations in the living room.
    However, the richest, brightest, and most meaningful life is still in the main hall of the Pioneer Palace.
    In the main hall, there is the Lenin-Stalin Room, which attracts most visitors. Students come here to listen to lectures about the life of the great revolutionary leaders; they bring here the models they made of Stalin's birthplace in Gori and the rooms on a street in Leningrad where Lenin lived and worked in the autumn of 1917. Many photos decorate the walls, and there are commemorative albums on several small tables, which the Pioneers put a lot of effort into compiling, recording the situation of their Pioneer meetings and their trips to various revolutionary memorial sites.
    The main hall is the most beautiful living room in the Pioneer Palace. Children meet famous scholars, writers, and actors from Leningrad here; there is the largest and brightest hall, where grand and joyful Christmas evening parties are held every year, dances are held for senior students, and game parties are held for children. This is a lively club for young entertainers; there is a library with 80,000 various books. The four reading rooms of the library collect all the juvenile publications and newspapers published in the Soviet Union.
    The Pioneers and students of Leningrad often correspond with students from various people's democratic countries. The letters they receive from foreign friends are placed in the main hall of the Pioneer Palace. The gifts sent to the Pioneer Palace from China, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary are carefully kept here: various bone artifacts and wooden artifacts, glassware, embroidery, paintings... The children of Leningrad cherish these gifts that symbolize noble friendship.
    Every evening, students from Leningrad come from all directions to participate in the Pioneer Palace children's lectures. Here, there are various thematic lectures: about the great communist construction projects being carried out by the Soviet people, about future technologies, about the living conditions of children in capitalist countries, about the creative activities of famous artists from various eras and nations....
    One wing of the main hall is completely designated as a science room. This is the world of activity for young historians, mathematicians, literary scholars, biologists, chemists, and geographers. One hundred and twenty topic groups have been organized for them. With the help of instructors, students participating in the group conduct various interesting experiments in order to better understand and comprehend many complex phenomena of nature. They also make reports on these topics, study the mineral and plant specimens they collected during their summer trips, and make the most attractive global "trips." Of course, in these attractive "trips," they have not actually left the room of the science room, which is indeed a bit regrettable! But everyone knows that many great travelers initially started their journeys from a globe.
    The Zhdanov Pioneer Palace is located in the center of Leningrad and is a paradise for children. Every evening, when people see the bright lights from the windows here, they can't help but smile with satisfaction. Here, and throughout the Soviet country, the lives of children are happy.

    这里的一切属于孩子们
    ——记列宁格勒日丹诺夫少先宫
    苏联  伊·郭洛文
    在列宁格勒喷泉河的河岸街上，有一排美丽而整齐的圆柱，圆柱的后面有两扇厚重的铁门……这里就是日丹诺夫少先宫的入口处。从敞开着的大门可以望见里边的广阔的院落，盛开各种鲜花的花坛和孩子们所驯养的许多鸽子，它们毫无顾忌地在柏油小道上和花圃上走来走去。
    在沙皇俄国时代，这里是俄国王公贵族们的居所，在宏伟的大厅里专为彼得堡的显贵们划出了华丽的接待室和舞厅。伟大的十月革命把这座美丽的宫院还给了劳动人民。苏维埃政府决定把这座宫院赠送给列宁格勒的孩子们。没有比这更好的礼物了。院内共有二百五十座房子，有安静的阅览室，美丽的客厅，雅致的大厅……但是这里的一切都需要重新安排和装置，使它们完全适合于新的小主人们的要求和爱好。
    列宁格勒的学者、雕刻家、艺术家和教师都参加了这一工作。他们尽力为孩子们想出最有益的、美丽的、最吸引人的东西。他们积极地从事雕塑、裱糊、电气和各种描画细工工作。后来，在一个晴朗的日子，载重汽车一辆接一辆地开进了院子，汽车为阅览室、实验室和快乐的游戏室载来了列宁格勒各工厂制造的特种设备和用具。这里边有小轮船、飞机、整条的小铁路、真正的车床、收音机、电影器械等等。
    少先宫开幕那一天，列宁格勒的各个工厂都派来了代表。在大门口，少先队的鲜红旗帜在雄壮的喇叭声和鼓声中升起来了，千万个幸福的孩子走进了院子，于是楼梯上，走廊上，大厅里都挤满了欢乐的人们……
    从那天起到现在，已经过了十多年了。根据约略的统计，这些年来到少先宫里参加各种小组活动，少先队营火会和各种讲演会及晚会的孩子，有几十万人。在苏联伟大卫国战争中，由于列宁格勒曾被敌人包围，少先宫遭受了轰炸和炮击。只有在这个短短的时期内，少先宫内的阅览室和实验室才沉寂了一个时候。
    今天，在列宁格勒少先宫的二百五十座房子里，正沸腾着一种友好的愉快的生活。凡是到过这个光明而愉快的孩子们的乐园的人们，都会不由自主地回想起这所少先宫建设工作的直接关怀者和参与者、苏联共产党的杰出活动家日丹诺夫同志所说的话：“在斯大林的阳光照耀下，孩子们的天才和能力像一个美丽花园里的花朵一样地盛开着。”在这里，孩子们的任何兴趣都能得到满足，他们的所有的天才都能得到发挥，因为这里为他们准备了一切。
    有很多客人来访问过列宁格勒少先宫。其他城市的人们也常到这里来观光。而现在，其他国家的人们也来了。需要化几个小时来参观优秀的雕刻家和艺术家们所装饰的客厅、安静的实验室和各种活动场所。这种参观，常常会激动每一个成年人，使他们也感到愉快和兴奋。有一次，这里曾来过一个斯堪的那维亚的工人代表团。当一个瑞典工人想要向包围着他的孩子们讲几句话的时候，他的眼睛突然润湿起来了。
    “我由于高兴和痛苦而流泪”，他后来说，“我们那里的孩子们，和当我还小的时候，都读过安徒生的童话。只有在童话里我们才读到过关于宫殿的情形，我们只是在自己简陋的小屋里梦想过这些，而且我们也确信，只有童话里才有这些宫殿，我们是永远也不会真正踏进这些美妙的宫殿的门槛的。所以，我为你们的幸福而兴奋，而激动得流泪，同时也为我们那里的孩子们还不知道这种情况而忧愁……”
    平常参观少先宫都是先从大门右侧的艺术教育厅开始的。当你沿着楼梯上去时，马上你就会感觉到，好像是在一座巨大的音乐剧院的侧房一样：帷幕就要升起，音乐演奏就要开始了！从一个艺术室里传来了咚咚的鼓声，另一个艺术室里提琴在演奏着轻快的曲调，在另一个房间里有人在大声地朗诵诗歌，又有人在齐声唱歌，而在大厅里，一群女孩子们正在跳着一种优美的舞蹈。钢琴声隐约可闻，……所有这些声音，融合成了一种不太匀称的声调，正像歌舞剧在上演前的情景一样。
    这里也设立有健身房，专供少先宫附设的儿童体育学校之用。学校的各个部门里共有学生二千五百人。有些人喜欢踢足球，另一些人下象棋，有人要滑雪，有人则对乘摩托车有着浓厚的兴趣，有人游泳、击剑、斗拳……总之难以一一列举。在这个体育学校教课的都是列宁格勒有名的运动家。每年冬季，在少先宫的花园里都要设备一个专供小孩子用的小型溜冰场。当列宁格勒的居民们走过花园附近的篱笆时，他们总要停下来爱慕地看看这些小溜冰家——他们一会儿在冰上划个圆圈，一会儿又做一些复杂的用脚尖旋转的动作……，艺术厅的正对面是技术厅——少先宫内最有趣的地方之一。技术厅有三层楼，包括各技术部门的四十八个专业实验室。这里的一切都是为了使孩子们能够取得现代技术的广阔知识：实验室内装备着各种能使孩子们随心所欲地从事任何制作的器械、工具、工作机和造船的模型，飞机的模型，以及无线电、无线电传影器等等。
    孩子们曾经化费了很多劳动和精力来创制一架
    “少先队”传影机，这架传影机在一九五一年全苏无线电传影机展览会上曾获得二等奖。少年技术爱好者用木头、金属和厚纸为学校制作了各种实物教学资料。占据几个房子的摄影实验室里所进行的工作，也是十分有趣的。很多小学生和这个实验室的访问者，都成了摄影的能手。他们对彩色摄影技术掌握得不坏，他们的作品有些已成为客厅里的装饰品。
    但是，最丰富，最明朗而有意义的生活还是在少先宫的主厅内。
    在主厅里，有吸引大多数访问者的列宁斯大林室。学生们到这里来听有关伟大革命领袖生平事迹的讲演；他们把自己仿照哥里城斯大林诞生的房子所作的模型，和一九一七年秋天列宁曾经在其中居住和工作过的列宁格勒一条大街上的几间房子的模型，都拿到这里来。很多照片装饰着墙壁，几张小桌子上摆着纪念册，这是少先队员们费了很大力气编制成的，纪念册里记录着他们的少先队会议的情况，以及他们到各革命纪念地旅行的情况。
    主厅是少先宫里最美丽的客厅，孩子们在这里会见列宁格勒有名的学者、作家和演员；这里有最大的明亮的大厅，每年在这里举行盛大的愉快的圣诞节晚会，为高年级学生举办舞会，也为儿童们举办游戏晚会。这里是少年娱乐者的一个热闹的俱乐部；这里有一个拥有八万册各种书籍的图书馆。在图书馆的四个阅览室里收集了苏联出版的一切少年读物和报纸。
    列宁格勒的少先队员和学生们同各人民民主国家的学生们常常通信。他们从国外朋友收到的来信，都放在少先宫的主厅里。这里谨慎地保管着从中国、波兰、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利送给少先宫的礼物：各种骨制艺术品和木制艺术品、玻璃品、刺绣、画片……列宁格勒的孩子们十分珍贵这些象征高贵友谊的礼物。
    每天晚上，列宁格勒的学生们从四面八方来参加少先宫儿童讲演会。这里有人作各种专题讲演：关于苏维埃人民正在进行着的伟大的共产主义建设工程，关于未来的技术，关于资本主义国家儿童的生活状况，关于各个时代各个民族的著名艺术家的创造活动……。
    主厅的一翼完全划为科学室。这是少年历史家、数学家、文学家、生物学家、化学家、地理学家们活动的天地。为他们组织了一百二十个课题小组。参加小组的学生们在指导者的帮助下进行着各种有趣的试验，以便能更好地理解和领会自然界的许多复杂现象。他们也作有关这些课题的报告，研究他们在夏季旅行中所收集的矿物、植物标本，并作最吸引人的全球“旅行”。当然，在这些吸引人的“旅行”中，他们实际上并没有离开过科学室的房间，这的确是有点儿遗憾！可是大家知道，很多伟大的旅行者在起初都是从地球仪旅行开始的。
    日丹诺夫少先宫位于列宁格勒市中心，它是孩子们的乐园。每到傍晚，当人们看到从这里的窗户发出的明亮的灯光时，都不禁满意地微笑了。在这里，和在整个苏维埃国家里一样，孩子们的生活是幸福的。（附图片）
