In 1952, Liling County, Hunan Province, achieved a large-scale increase in rice production. Based on this, it actively and steadily promotes advanced farming experience, and widely and deeply mobilizes 600,000 farmers to strive for a greater harvest in 1953. Since the autumn harvest last year, the Party and government leading organs of Liling County have paid attention to how to find the key to continued production increase, further enhance the confidence of the masses and cadres in increasing production, improve leadership methods, and strengthen specific leadership in agricultural production. In solving this problem, they started with investigation and research, summarized the experience of increasing production last year, and studied ways to further tap production potential. After investigation and research, it was found that there was still serious waste in the use of land fertility in Liling County (in most areas of the county, the spacing between rice plants was one foot four inches to one foot six inches). The Liling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly analyzed the local actual situation and the production experience of the masses, and finally decided to actively and steadily promote the advanced farming techniques of "deep plowing and close planting, salt water seed selection, sparse sowing and less transplanting, and rational fertilization" throughout the county in 1953.

In early January, the Liling County People's Government convened a meeting of district chiefs and production assistants to specifically study the training of active production elements in rural areas, the promotion of advanced experience, and the improvement of farming techniques. After the meeting, the county held "Patriotic Production and Bumper Harvest Activists Training Classes" in separate districts, training a total of 6,221 people, most of whom were farmers with production experience and active production elements who were easy to accept advanced experience. After returning to their hometowns, they actively led the masses and established technical guidance committees and technical study and research groups in various townships and villages. The extensive activities of the activists set off a mass upsurge of learning advanced experience. In the county's 493 townships, an average of more than 300 farmers in each township participated in the study. In promoting advanced experience, the practice of focusing on demonstration and patient education has generally been adhered to. For example, when promoting "salt water seed selection," it encountered great resistance. Because this experience was the only one among all the experiences to be promoted that did not come from the local masses; this was a scientific method decided by the county's leading organs after seeing that rice production had been reduced by 2% last year due to rice blast and Marasmius disease. In promoting this advanced experience, active production elements played an important role, and they carried out demonstration work in rural areas. Chenlong Township conducted experiments when promoting salt water seed selection. Two catties of seed rice were selected with salt water and clean water respectively. In the former, eight taels and five mace of bad grains floated to the surface, while in the latter, only three taels and five mace of bad grains floated to the surface. In this way, the masses initially believed it. But they were still afraid that salt water seed selection would damage the seed rice and prevent it from germinating. After the activists soaked the two catties of seed rice selected with salt water, they put it in palm packages. After a few days, it germinated neatly, and the masses' worries were dispelled. The leaders taught the masses the specific methods of seed selection to avoid losses caused by incorrect methods. In this way, about 50% of the farmers in the county selected seeds using the method of "sharing water but not grain" in temporary combinations to save salt water. Now all the seeds have germinated, and the seedlings are growing vigorously. According to statistics from six districts, about 50% of the farmers have accepted sparse sowing, expanded the area of seedling fields, and made suitable seedling fields. Many farmers have modified their rice transplanting markers (Liling farmers have the habit of transplanting seedlings on shelves) to adapt to appropriate close planting.

After the production campaign began this year, Liling County has conducted three inspections: the first was in early February, focusing on water conservancy; the second was in early March, inspecting the preparations for spring plowing and production, and solving the problems of lack of draught cattle and fertilizer; the third was in early April, inspecting the county's implementation of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on spring plowing and production, as well as the publicity of production policies and the stabilization of farmers' production sentiment. Each inspection lasted for five to seven days. Members of the county party committee and the county magistrate went deep into the townships to conduct inspections, and initially corrected the chaotic phenomenon of "too many" in rural areas. Especially the third inspection, deeply discovered that there were still many serious problems in the leadership of agricultural production. Subjectivism and formalism, and their bad consequences, were serious lessons in last year's agricultural production work; and this year many cadres have not yet completely broken away from the influence of this style, blindly demanding that farmers raise production increase targets; developing mutual aid teams too hastily, and still accustomed to general appeals in working methods. Some places only paid attention to promoting advanced technology, and did not pay attention to carrying out in-depth ideological and political education for the majority of farmers. After discovering these problems, attention has been paid to correcting them.

### 湖南醴陵县在春播中稳步推广先进技术

    湖南醴陵县在春播中稳步推广先进技术
    湖南省醴陵县在一九五二年水稻大面积增产的基础上，积极地、稳步地推广先进耕作经验，广泛而深入地动员六十万农民争取一九五三年更大的丰收。醴陵县的党、政领导机关自去年秋收后就注意了如何找出继续增产的窍门，进一步提高群众和干部对增产的信心，改进领导方法，加强农业生产的具体领导的问题。他们在解决这一问题时，从调查研究入手，总结了去年的增产经验，研究了进一步挖掘生产潜力的办法。经过调查研究，发现醴陵县在地力的使用上还存在严重的浪费现象（全县大部地区水稻栽种的株行距是一尺四寸至一尺六寸）。中共醴陵县委对本地实际情况及群众生产经验反复作了具体分析，最后决定一九五三年在全县范围内积极地、稳步地推广“深耕密植，盐水选种，稀播少插，合理施肥”的先进耕作技术。
    一月上旬，醴陵县人民政府召开了各区区长和生产助理员会议，专门研究训练农村中的生产积极分子、推广先进经验、提高耕作技术等问题。会后，全县分区举办了“爱国丰产积极分子训练班”，共训练了六千二百二十一人，大部分是有生产经验的农民和容易接受先进经验的生产积极分子。他们回乡后便积极带动群众，在各乡、村成立技术指导委员会和技术学习研究小组。积极分子的广泛活动，掀起了群众性学习先进经验的高潮。全县四百九十三个乡，平均每乡有三百多农民参加了学习。在推广先进经验时，一般都坚持了重点示范和耐心教育的作法。如在推广“盐水选种”时，曾遇到了极大的阻碍。因为这条经验是在所有准备推广的经验中唯一不是来自当地群众的东西；这是县的领导机关看到去年水稻因稻热病和马鹿菌病而减产百分之二的情况，决定采用的科学办法。在推广这一先进经验时，生产积极分子起了重要的作用，他们在乡村中进行了示范工作。陈垄乡在推广盐水选种时进行实验，用盐水和清水分别选两斤种谷，前者有八两五钱坏谷子浮出水面，后者只有三两五钱坏谷子浮出。这样群众才初步相信了。但他们还害怕盐水选种会伤种谷，发不了芽。积极分子把盐水选的两斤种谷浸好后，放在棕包里，过几天就整齐地发芽了，群众的顾虑就打消了。领导方面把选种的具体办法教给群众，避免因方法错误而造成损失。这样，全县约有百分之五十的农户，用“共水不共谷”的临时组合、节约盐水的方法选了种。现在种谷已全部发芽，秧苗茁壮地成长着。现据六个区的统计，约有百分之五十的农户接受了稀播，扩大了秧田面积，并做了合式秧田。许多农民把自己的插秧划行器
    （醴陵农民有插架子秧的习惯）改成适应于适当密植的尺度。
    醴陵全县在今年生产运动开始后已进行了三次检查工作：第一次是在二月初，以检查水利为主；第二次是在三月初，检查春耕生产的准备工作，解决缺乏耕牛和肥料的问题；第三次是在四月初，检查全县贯彻中共中央关于春耕生产的指示及宣传生产政策、稳定农民生产情绪的情况。每次检查为时五天至七天，县委委员和县长都深入到乡进行检查，初步纠正农村中“五多”的混乱现象。尤其是第三次检查，深入发现了农业生产领导工作中还存在许多严重问题。主观主义和形式主义的倾向及其恶果，曾是去年农业生产工作中的严重教训；而今年很多干部还未能全部脱离这种作风的影响，盲目地要求农民提高增产指标；过于草率地发展互助组，工作方法上还习惯于一般号召。还有一些地方仅仅注意了推广先进技术，没有注意对广大农民进行深入的思想教育与政策教育。发现这些问题之后，已经注意纠正。
