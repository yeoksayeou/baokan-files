    The directly subordinate organizations of Songjiang Province formulated plans last winter to support basic construction. In order to further strengthen and urge all units to conscientiously implement the plans, the CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee recently organized an inspection of the implementation of basic construction support plans.

    The inspection results proved that the general units are relatively serious in implementing the plans, and the idea of "putting basic construction in the first place" has been universally established among cadres. This is reflected in the daily work, where attention has been paid to serving basic construction, and much work has been done in this regard, achieving some results. This is reflected in:

    I. In the supply of basic construction materials. The Industry Department has made the production of basic construction materials a key focus, especially emphasizing the need to resolutely improve the production of red bricks (the most serious problem in local materials is red bricks). A basic construction materials group was established in the department's production section, and strong cadres were assigned. In order to help solve the technical problems of red brick production, three technical personnel (one each for electrical, mechanical, and chemical) were transferred from the department's technical office to help solve electrical and mechanical failures, test soil quality, and study the water absorption rate and compressive strength of red bricks. Specialized personnel were also regularly sent to understand and grasp the production of lime, stones, plywood, etc. The various professional companies under the leadership and guidance of the Commerce Department also paid attention to the supply of basic construction materials. Small hardware has been purchased according to plan, and those who currently feel that the source of goods is insufficient have also sent people to the superior companies of various systems to request solutions.

    II. In the supply of daily necessities. The Commerce Department has designated a manager and section chief to specifically handle work serving basic construction, and will regularly conduct in-depth inspections of various companies in the future. Currently, Harbin, Jiamusi, Mishan, Acheng and other places where there are construction sites have generally organized mobile sales groups for commodities, and some have established sales departments and stalls. Harbin Department Store has established four construction site service departments. Jiamusi City has conducted a survey of daily necessities needed for basic construction. Generally, managers of various companies personally control the work of allocating materials to construction sites. The Native Products Company and Cooperatives directly contact construction sites in nine areas in Harbin City through regional supply of non-staple foods for basic construction sites. Basically, the needs of the construction sites have been met.

    III. In highway transportation. After the Highway Bureau was criticized in the newspaper for not paying attention to basic construction work, it re-studied the documents and reviewed its thinking on serving basic construction. Now, the leading cadres of the bureau often go deep into the provincial transportation company to guide basic construction transportation issues. In order to meet the needs of basic construction transportation, they have increased the repair of roads and bridges connecting Harbin, Jiamusi and Ning'an County to construction sites and transporting basic construction materials. The Provincial Transportation Company convened a highway transportation conference on April 1st, clearly arranging that the current central task is to vigorously support basic construction. The Provincial Transportation Company, led by the manager, has three section chiefs who have specialized in helping Harbin City solve transportation problems.

    IV. In order to meet the needs of basic construction, the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee and the Personnel Department of the Provincial Government transferred a large number of cadres from various units. In the transfer of cadres, each unit did have difficulties. For example, the Civil Affairs Department currently has only one section chief in some sections, but they did not hesitate to send eight section chiefs to support basic construction. The Postal and Telecommunications Administration has trained a group of staff to serve basic construction, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas. These personnel are now serving very well, and they plan to continue to run such training classes. Seeing that the cooperative leadership cadres in basic construction (as well as industrial and mining areas and forest areas) were weak, the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives took the initiative to transfer a group of strong cadres from its own system.

### 中共松江省委检查直属机关支援基本建设计划执行情况

    中共松江省委检查直属机关支援基本建设计划执行情况
    松江省直属机关各单位在去年冬天曾订出了支援基本建设的计划。中共松江省委为进一步加强与督促各单位认真执行计划，最近组织了一次支援基本建设计划执行情况的检查。
    检查结果证明：一般的单位在执行计划中是比较认真的，“把基本建设放在首要地位”的思想已在干部中普遍树立起来，表现在日常工作上已注意到为基本建设服务，并在这方面做了许多工作，取得了一些成绩。这表现在：
    一、在基本建设材料的供应上。工业厅把基本建设材料的生产做为领导重点，特别提出要坚决搞好红砖的生产（地方材料中最严重的是红砖问题）。在厅里生产科中成立了基本建设材料组，并配备了较强的干部。他们为了帮助解决红砖生产的技术问题，从厅内技术室抽调三名技术人员（电气、机械、化学各一名），帮助解决电气、机械故障和化验土质及研究红砖的吃水率、耐压率问题。对石灰、石头、胶合板等的生产，也都派了专门人员经常了解掌握。在商业厅领导和指导下的各专业公司，也都注意基本建设材料的供应工作，小五金已按计划进货，某些目前感到货源不足的，也都派人到各系统上级公司请示解决。
    二、在生活日用品的供应上。商业厅指定了经理、科长专搞为基本建设服务的工作，今后将定期深入各公司检查。现在哈尔滨、佳木斯、密山、阿城等地，有工地的地方已普遍组织了流通商品推销组，有的并成立了推销部和摊床。哈尔滨百货公司已成立了四处工地服务部。佳木斯市做了基本建设生活必需品的调查工作。各公司一般都是经理亲自掌握为工地调拨物资的工作。土产公司、合作社通过分区供应基本建设工地的副食品，在哈尔滨市分九个地方与工地直接联系。基本上满足了各工地的需要。
    三、在公路运输上。公路局从报纸批评该局不重视基本建设工作后，即重新学习了文件，联系检查了为基本建设服务的思想。现在该局的领导干部经常深入到省运输公司指导基本建设运输问题。他们为了基本建设运输的需要，增加补修了哈尔滨、佳木斯两市及宁安县通往工地和运输基本建设材料的道路、桥梁。省运输公司在四月一日召开了公路运输会议，明确布置目前以大力支援基本建设为中心工作。省运输公司由经理领导三个科长专门深入哈尔滨市帮助解决运输问题。
    四、为了满足基本建设需要，省委组织部和省府人事厅从各单位抽调了大批干部。在抽调干部中各单位也确有困难，如民政厅有的科现在只有一个科长，但他们也毫不犹豫地为基本建设输送了八个科长。邮电管理局已训练了一批为基本建设、工矿、林区服务的工作人员，这些人员现在服务得都很好，他们拟继续开办这样的训练班。省联社看到基本建设（还有工矿、林区）的合作社领导干部弱，主动从本系统抽调了一批强有力的干部。
