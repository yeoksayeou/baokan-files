Some areas of Si Hong County in Anhui Province, and Pingyuan and Leling Counties in Shandong Province, have begun to discover locust nymphs. The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture has again sent a telegram to all regions urging them to immediately investigate the hatching situation of locust nymphs, closely monitor their activities, and expedite the transportation of pesticides and equipment, as well as organize sufficient manpower, to avoid passivity in the work and prevent losses. This year, the emergence of locust nymphs is earlier than in previous years, and the leading organs of the locust-affected provinces have also actively deployed locust control work. For example, the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Government issued instructions on the 12th of this month, instructing Party committees at all levels to effectively lead farmers in doing a good job in locust control. In light of the situation in Jiangsu Province, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government has made specific instructions on locust control and established a Provincial Locust Control Office. In terms of locust control preparation, according to statistics from the recent meeting of locust control station chiefs in the province, 3,515 surveyors have been trained in 19 counties, and 7,061 pesticide applicators have been trained in 13 counties. 1.5 million catties of 666 pesticide powder and more than 3,500 dusting machines ordered this year have been transported to the locust-affected areas. Shandong Province has also ordered more than 2,500 dusting machines this year (twenty times more than last year) and trained more than 2,000 locust control personnel.

    安徽、山东部分地区开始发现蝗蝻
    中央农业部再次电示各地迅速作好治蝗准备工作
    安徽省泗洪县和山东省平原、乐陵两县已开始发现蝗蝻。中央人民政府农业部已再次电示各地立即侦查蝗蝻孵化情况，严密监视蝗蝻的活动，并赶运药械和组织足够人力，避免工作被动，造成损失。今年蝗蝻出土较往年为早，蝗区各省领导机关也已积极布置治蝗工作。如中共中央山东分局和省府已于本月十二日指示责成各级党委切实领导农民做好治蝗工作。江苏省人民政府针对该省情况，作了治蝗的具体指示和成立省治蝗办公室，在治蝗准备工作方面，根据该省最近召开蝗虫防治站站长会议上的统计，已有十九个县训练侦查员三五一五人，十三个县训练药械手七○六一人，并已将六六六药粉一百五十万斤和今年订制的喷粉器三千五百余架运赴蝗区。山东省今年也订制了喷粉器二千五百余架（较去年多出二十倍），并训练治蝗人员二千多名。
