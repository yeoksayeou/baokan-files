The name "Hui" or "Huihui" was previously used to refer to all ethnic groups who believed in Islam. In fact, although these ethnic groups share the same religion, they each have their own ethnic characteristics and are different ethnic groups. Since liberation, they have been referred to as "Hui," "Uyghur," "Kazakh," "Uzbek," "Kyrgyz," "Tajik," "Tatar," "Dongxiang," "Salar," and "保安族 (Bonan)" according to their respective names.

The Hui people in China number approximately five million, making them one of the most populous ethnic minorities in China. They are distributed throughout the country. Almost every major city and market town with convenient transportation has Hui people living there. The three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai in the Northwest region are areas where the Hui people are more concentrated.

The Hui people have suffered deep national persecution in history. The Manchu Qing government massacred many Hui people in the Northwest and Southwest, and there are still bone towers left over from that time in the Northwest. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Chiang Kai-shek and reactionary elements among the Hui people, such as Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, and Bai Chongxi, colluded with each other and exploited each other, cruelly oppressing and exploiting people of all ethnic groups, and provoking relations between people of all ethnic groups in order to achieve their goal of dividing people of all ethnic groups and maintaining their reactionary rule. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang even called the Hui people "nationals with special living habits in the interior," and did not recognize the Hui people as a nation at all.

The Hui people have waged many struggles to resist oppression and enslavement. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, there were Hui peasant leaders in the ranks of peasant movements. During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the uprisings of people of all ethnic groups led by the Hui people's leader Du Wenxiu in Yunnan, and the uprisings of the Hui people in the Northwest, echoed each other with the Taiping Army at that time, launching a massive struggle against the Manchu Qing Dynasty, which lasted for one or two decades.

In the past thirty years or so, the Chinese Communist Party has led the people of the whole country in revolutionary struggle, and the Hui people participated very early on. In the ranks of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, there were Hui armed organizations. Many revolutionary advanced elements from the Hui people joined the Chinese Communist Party and waged a long-term and resolute struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hui people in many areas organized anti-Japanese groups, especially anti-Japanese armed forces, such as the Ma Benzhai Hui Detachment in Hebei Province and the Hui Detachment and Hui Brigade in Shandong, and resolutely attacked the enemy together with the Han people. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they also participated in the People's Liberation War.

The Hui people's struggles have all failed. Only when China had the leadership of the Communist Party did they achieve liberation.

Since liberation, due to the people's government's implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, the Hui people, like all ethnic minorities in the country, have made great progress in political, economic, and cultural undertakings.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Hui autonomous townships were established in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. In counties and districts with large Hui populations in the old liberated areas such as Shandong, there were also Hui county heads and district heads. After the nationwide liberation, the first urban Hui Autonomous Region was established in Gui Sui (Hohhot). After the promulgation of the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China, regional autonomy movements were more widely carried out in various Hui areas. At present, a Hui autonomous region equivalent to a county level and seven Hui autonomous regions equivalent to a district level have been established nationwide. In Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Dihua (Ürümqi) in Xinjiang, preparations are underway to establish Hui autonomous regions equivalent to special district or county levels. Counties, districts, and townships where other Hui people live in concentrated communities are also actively preparing to establish autonomous regions.

In areas where the Hui people live together with the Han people and other ethnic groups, most of them have established ethnic democratic coalition governments. In areas where the Hui people live, almost all People's Representatives Conferences have Hui representatives, and the People's Government has also absorbed an appropriate number of Hui cadres to participate in the work. According to incomplete statistics, there are about fifty Hui people in the People's Government committees at the provincial and municipal levels across the country. In areas with large Hui populations, there are also many Hui people who hold important positions such as county head, mayor, and vice-chairman of the province.

In August of last year, the Government Administration Council promulgated the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Rights of National Equality for All Scattered Ethnic Minority Components," which is of great significance for guaranteeing the Hui people scattered in the interior to enjoy various equal rights and freedoms.

In areas where autonomous regions or ethnic democratic coalition governments have been established, unprecedented new atmospheres have emerged, realizing the right of the Hui people to be masters of their own affairs.

In the great land reform movement, the vast number of Hui peasants were distributed land. Many rural Hui people who had to engage in backward or unpromising industries such as brokerage and tooth-trading in the past due to lack of land, also received land in the land reform and turned to agricultural production. Under the leadership and assistance of the people's government, the Hui peasants in various places gradually developed production. They organized Hui mutual aid groups, or formed mutual aid groups with farmers of other ethnic groups. Some mutual aid groups have even developed into agricultural production cooperatives.

The Hui people living in cities generally lack capital due to historical reasons, and have to rely on selling small vendors, cold food vendors, slaughtering cattle and sheep, etc., relying on large advances and small debts; living a life without security. Since liberation, in the process of the restoration and development of the entire national economy, some of these industries have declined, and some have encountered temporary difficulties. In response to this situation, the people's governments at all levels have adopted measures such as helping the Hui people to change jobs and find employment, providing small loans, and providing work as a form of relief to solve the Hui people's living difficulties. The "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" promulgated by the Government Administration Council in August 1952 specifically stipulated the issue of the Hui people's job transfer and employment: "The unemployment problem of ethnic minority residents scattered in cities, currently mainly the unemployment and underemployment problem of the Hui people, must be earnestly paid attention to and helped to solve." The work of the people's governments at all levels in helping the Hui people to change jobs and find employment has achieved many results. For example, the Hui Autonomous Region People's Government of Gui Sui (Hohhot) introduced 882 male workers and 459 female workers to various enterprise departments. Among the Hui people introduced for employment in other cities, there were 1,148 in Xi'an, 2,453 in Beijing, 685 in Tianjin, and more than 3,000 in Shenyang, Northeast China. The cities of Dalian and Mudanjiang and Jiamusi in Songjiang Province have basically eliminated the unemployment of the Hui people. Other places have also solved the employment problems of many unemployed and underemployed Hui people.

Schools in the Hui areas have also been generally reorganized and restored, and have been developed conditionally. For example, before the liberation of Ningxia Province, there were only fourteen Hui elementary schools, and now the number of junior primary schools and complete primary schools has increased to one hundred and four. In general schools with a large number of Hui people, in order to take care of the living habits of the Hui people, separate kitchens have been set up for Hui students. In order to help Hui children have more common opportunities to go to school, the people's government stipulates that Hui students in general schools are exempted from or reduced tuition fees. At present, more than 70% of Hui school-age children in some areas have entered schools. In Gui Sui (Hohhot), the number of Hui children enrolled in schools has reached more than 90% of the school-age children, which is six times more than before liberation. In Chengde, 89% of school-age children are currently enrolled in schools. However, the current development is still uneven, and this situation will be gradually eliminated.

Due to the attention and assistance of the people's government, Hui cadres have grown rapidly. There are Hui students in the Central and local ethnic academies, and some areas, such as Beijing, Hebei, and Henan, have held short-term training courses. All localities have also paid attention to training many Hui cadres in their work. Most of the Hui cadres have played an active role in various tasks, demonstrated their strengths, and can correctly implement ethnic policies in the work of their own ethnic groups and integrate with the masses.

The Hui people have their own religious beliefs and customs. The Hui people believe in Islam. Wherever they live in concentrated communities, there are mosques. Mosques are places where the Hui people collectively worship, and it is customary not to welcome non-believers to enter casually. Islam has a regulation of fasting for thirty days each year. Fasting means not eating or drinking during the day, and only eating and drinking after sunset and before dawn each day. When the fasting period is over, the fast is broken, which the Hui people call "Greater Eid," which is a very grand event, equivalent to the Han people's Lunar New Year. At this time, everyone slaughters cattle and sheep, gathers for meals, exchanges gifts, and celebrates the festival. Seventy days after Eid al-Fitr, there is another festival called "Lesser Eid," also called "Qurban," on this day, the Hui people fast for half a day. Another major festival is "Mawlid," which is the anniversary of the birth of Muhammad, the founder of Islam.

The Hui people do not eat pork, and all beasts that do not ruminate and do not have cloven hooves, and animals without stomachs, and fish without scales are not eaten. The slaughter of livestock and poultry must be carried out by the Mufti (religious personnel in the Hui community), otherwise it cannot be eaten. The Hui people also do not eat livestock and poultry that die of natural causes. In addition, the Hui people have many taboos in their diet.

The Hui people's religious beliefs and customs are respected and cared for by the people's government.

Since liberation, the Hui people in various places have been closely united with the Han people and other ethnic groups. The Hui and Han people have established deep friendships in various movements. For example, in Majiabao, Linxia, Gansu, the Hui and Han people call the canal they jointly opened the "Unity Canal." When a township in Yongjing County, Gansu, implemented land reform, the Han farmers took the initiative to take care of the Hui farmers and cleaned the houses distributed to the Hui farmers spotlessly.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hui people have entered a new historical period and are advancing on the road of happiness and development.

    生活在新中国的回族
    郑宗
    “回族”或“回回”这个名称，过去曾被用来称呼所有信仰伊斯兰教的民族。其实这些民族虽信仰同一宗教，但各有自己的民族特征，是不同的民族。解放以来，已经根据他们各自的称呼，分别称为“回族”、“维吾尔族”、“哈萨克族”、“乌兹别克族”、“柯尔克兹族”、“塔吉克族”、“塔塔尔族”、“东乡族”、“撒拉族”、“保安族”。
    全国回族大约有五百万人左右，是中国少数民族中人口较多的民族之一。他们分布在全国各地。凡是交通比较方便的大城市、大集镇，差不多都有回族人民居住。西北区的甘肃、宁夏、青海三省，是回族比较集中的地区。
    回族在历史上曾受过深重的民族迫害。满清政府曾经在西北和西南屠杀过许多回民，现在西北还有当时遗留下来的白骨塔。在国民党反动派统治时期，蒋匪介石和回族中的反动分子如马步芳、马鸿逵、白崇禧等彼此勾结，互相利用，残酷地压迫和剥削各族人民，并挑拨各民族人民之间的关系，以达到他们分化各民族人民、维持反动统治的目的。蒋介石匪帮并且把回民叫做“内地生活习惯特殊之国民”，根本不承认回族是一个民族。
    回族为了反抗压迫和奴役，曾经进行过多次的斗争。在元朝和明朝，农民运动队伍里有回族的农民领袖。满清时代，回族杜文秀在云南领导的各民族人民的起义，西北回族的起义，都曾与当时的太平军彼此呼应，展开了声势浩大的反抗满清的斗争，坚持了一、二十年之久。
    近三十多年来，中国共产党领导全国人民进行革命斗争，回族人民很早就参加了。在工农红军的队伍里，就有回族的武装组织。回族中有不少的革命先进分子参加中国共产党，曾经和国民党反动派进行过长期的坚决的斗争。抗日战争时期，在中国共产党领导下，很多地区的回族人民组织抗日团体，特别是抗日武装部队，如河北省的马本斋回民支队和山东的回民支队、回民大队等，和汉族人民一道坚决地打击敌人。抗日战争胜利后，他们又参加了人民解放战争。
    回族人民的历次斗争都失败了。直到最后中国有了共产党的领导，才得到解放。
    解放以来，由于人民政府执行了毛主席的民族政策，回族人民和全国各少数民族人民一样，在政治、经济、文化事业各方面，都有了很大的发展。
    在抗日战争时期，陕甘宁边区就建立了回民自治乡。在山东等地老解放区的回民较多的县、区，还有回族的县长、区长。全国解放以后，归绥建立了第一个城市的回民自治区。中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要公布后，各回民地区更普遍开展了区域自治运动。目前全国已建立了一个相当于县级的回族自治区，七个相当于区级的回族自治区。在甘肃、宁夏、青海和新疆的迪化等地区，正在分别筹备建立相当于专区或县级的回族自治区。其他各地回族聚居的县、区和乡，也正在积极筹备建立自治区。
    在回族和汉族以及和其他民族杂居地区，大部都已建立了民族民主联合政府。在有回族居住的地区，人民代表会议中差不多都有回族代表，人民政府中并吸收了适当数目的回族干部参加工作。据不完全统计，全国省、市以上的人民政府委员中，有五十名左右的回族人士。在回族较多的地区，还有许多的回族人士担任县长、市长、省的副主席等重要职务。
    去年八月，政务院公布“关于保障一切散居的少数民族成份享有民族平等权利的决定”，对于保障散居内地的回族人民享有各种平等权利和自由权利有着重要的意义。
    在已建立自治区或民族民主联合政府的地区，都出现了历史上空前未有的新气象，实现了回族当家作主的权利。
    在伟大的土地改革运动中，广大的回族农民分得了土地。许多农村回民过去因缺乏土地而不得不经营经纪、牙行等落后的或无前途的行业，他们在土地改革中也分得了土地，转到了农业生产上来。在人民政府的领导和帮助下，各地回族农民逐步地发展了生产。他们组织了回民互助组，或和其他民族农民组成互助组。有的互助组并已发展为农业生产合作社。
    在城市居住的回族人民，由于历史的原因，一般缺乏资本，不得不依靠大赊小欠经营叫卖小贩、冷食摊贩、宰牛羊等行业；过着没有保障的生活。解放以来，在整个国民经济恢复和发展的过程中，这些行业有的趋于衰落，有的遭遇了暂时的困难。各级人民政府针对这种情况，曾采取了帮助回民转业、就业，举办小本贷款，以工代赈等措施，解决回民的生活困难。一九五二年八月政务院公布的关于劳动就业问题的决定中，对回族人民的转业、就业问题特别作了规定：“对散居在城市的少数民族居民的失业问题，目前主要是回民的失业半失业问题，必须切实注意帮助解决。”各地人民政府在帮助回民转业、就业方面的工作，已有不少成绩。如归绥市回族自治区人民政府介绍到各企业部门工作的回民，有男工八百八十二人，女工四百五十九人。其他城市经介绍就业的回民，计西安市有一千一百四十八人，北京市有二千四百五十三人，天津市有六百八十五人，东北沈阳市有三千多人，旅大和松江省的牡丹江、佳木斯等城市，已基本上消灭了回民的失业现象。其他各地，也解决了不少失业、半失业的回民的职业问题。
    回族地区的学校也普遍地经过了整理和恢复，并有条件地进行了发展。如宁夏省解放前只有回民完小十四所，现在初小与完小已发展到一百零四所。在一般的回民较多的学校中，为照顾回民的生活习惯，给回族学生单独设立了伙房。为了帮助回民子弟能有较普遍的就学机会，人民政府规定在一般学校里减收或免收回族学生的学费。现在某些地区百分之七十以上的回族学龄儿童都已经进了学校。归绥市回族入学儿童已达学龄儿童的百分之九十以上，比解放前增加了六倍。承德市现有百分之八十九的学龄儿童入学。不过目前发展还不平衡，这种情况将会逐步消除。
    由于人民政府的重视和帮助，回族干部生长得很快。在中央和各地民族学院中都有回族学员，有些地区，如北京市及河北、河南等地举办了短期训练班。各地在工作中也注意培养了许多回族干部。大多数的回族干部，在各种工作中都发挥了积极作用，表现了他们的长处，在本民族的工作中，能正确地贯彻执行民族政策，和群众打成一片。
    回族人民有自己的宗教信仰和风俗习惯。回族人民信仰伊斯兰教。凡是他们聚居的区域，都有清真寺。清真寺是回民集体作礼拜的地方，习惯上是不欢迎教外人随便进去的。伊斯兰教有每年封斋三十天的规定。封斋就是在白天不进饮食，每天只在太阳没后和黎明之前吃喝。封斋期满要开斋，回民叫做“大尔代”，这是一件很隆重的事，相当于汉族的旧历年节。这时大家宰牛宰羊，聚餐送礼，欢度佳节。在开斋后七十天，又有一个节日叫“小尔代”，也叫“古尔邦”，在这一天，回民封斋半日。另一个大的节日是“圣诞节”，这天是伊斯兰教创始人穆罕默德的诞辰纪念日。
    回民不吃猪肉，并且凡是不反刍、又不分蹄的兽类和没有胃的禽兽、没有鳞的鱼类，都不吃。屠宰牲畜禽类都需由掌教人（回族中的宗教人员）屠宰，否则不能吃。自死的牲畜禽类，回民也不吃。此外回民在饮食上还有很多禁忌。
    回族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，都受到人民政府的尊重和关怀。
    解放以来，各地回民和汉民以及其他各族人民都亲密地团结起来了。回、汉人民在各个运动中建立了深厚的友谊。例如甘肃临夏马家堡地方，回汉人民把他们共同开出的渠叫做“团结渠”。甘肃永靖县的一个乡实行土地改革时，汉族农民主动地照顾回族农民，并把分给回族农民的屋子打扫得干干净净。
    回族人民在中国共产党的领导下，已进入新的历史时期，已在幸福的发展的道路上前进。
