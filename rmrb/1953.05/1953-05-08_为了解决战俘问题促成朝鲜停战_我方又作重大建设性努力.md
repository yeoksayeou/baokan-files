Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communiqué on May 7th:

    At the plenary session of both delegations on May 7th, our side, in order to facilitate the Korean armistice, made further significant and constructive efforts to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue. Because the other side, in the past ten days of negotiations, stubbornly insisted on leaving the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea under the temporary custody of neutral nations, the realization of the Korean armistice was again hindered by issues of procedure and method, and the world's people's desire for a Korean armistice was once again dealt a blow. Therefore, in addition to retaining our side's proposal of April 26th to send non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral nations, we also attempted to adopt the other side's premise: proposing another new plan.

    At the meeting on May 7th, General Nam Il said:

    "Our side's specific implementation plan proposed on April 26th regarding the handling of the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war is based on the premise of sending the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral nations. However, the discussions at the negotiation meetings over the past ten days have proven that your side wants to obscure our premise by first resolving the issue of nominating neutral nations, intending to use this to realize another premise proposed by your side, namely, to leave the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea and have neutral nations come to Korea to take them over.

    We believe that the above two premises are completely different, and there should be different handling plans under different premises. Our side's plan is to send the non-directly repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to neutral nations, release them from your original control, and have neutral nations take them over; then, after our side sends people to neutral nations to explain to them, so that they can dispel their fears and thus have the possibility of expressing their will; then, all prisoners of war among them who request repatriation should be guaranteed by the relevant neutral nation authorities to be repatriated to their homeland. Your side's plan, on the other hand, is to keep the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war within the area controlled by the detaining side. This will obviously make it impossible for these prisoners of war to completely break free from the control of the detaining side, and it will also be very difficult for neutral nations to go to the area controlled by the detaining side to take over the large number of prisoners of war you are talking about. At the same time, this situation will make it even more impossible for the explanatory work of the relevant parties to obtain due freedom and convenience. Comparing the two plans, our side's plan is the one that best embodies the principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention and international practice, so that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation can be resolved fairly and reasonably.

    However, in the discussions over the past ten days, your side has stubbornly insisted on the premise you proposed of keeping the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea and having neutral nations come to Korea to take them over. In view of the fact that your stubborn behavior will cause the realization of the Korean armistice to be hindered again by issues of procedure and method, thereby dealing another blow to the desire for a Korean armistice of the people who have children fighting in Korea and the peace-loving people of the world, I now declare that we will continue to retain the plan we proposed on April 26th, but at the same time be prepared, on the condition that your side accepts the following new plan we are now proposing, to attempt to adopt your premise, namely, to continue to leave the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in their original detention locations to be repatriated by neutral nations. I should point out that our side's plan proposed on April 26th is still more reasonable compared to this new plan made under your premise.

    The content of our new plan is as follows:

    1.  Within two months after the armistice agreement takes effect, both sides shall, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 51 of the armistice agreement, and based on the final lists exchanged and corrected by both sides, repatriate all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation in batches and hand them over to the side to which the prisoners of war belong, without any obstruction.

    2.  In order to assist the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to return to their hometowns, both sides agree to establish a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, composed of an equal number of representatives from each of the five countries stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 37 of the armistice agreement, namely Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, and India agreed upon by both sides.

    3.  All prisoners of war on both sides, except for those who should be directly repatriated as stipulated in Article 1 of this plan, should be released from the military control and custody of the detaining side at their original detention locations, and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stipulated in Article 2 of this plan for reception and custody. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall have the power to exercise its legitimate duties and responsibilities to control the prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction. To ensure the effective implementation of this power, the member countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall each equip an equal number of armed forces.

    4.  After taking over the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall immediately make arrangements to allow the country to which the prisoners of war belong to have freedom and convenience, within a period of four months from the date of takeover by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, to send people to the original detention locations of these prisoners of war to explain to all prisoners of war who are affiliated with that country, to eliminate their concerns, and to notify the prisoners of war of any matters related to their return to their hometowns, especially their complete right to return home to live a peaceful life.

    5.  Within four months from the date the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over the prisoners of war, all prisoners of war who, after being explained to by their country, request to return home, shall be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to quickly return to their homeland, and the detaining party shall not create difficulties. The administrative details of the repatriation of these prisoners of war shall be resolved by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in consultation with both sides.

    6.  After the expiration of the four-month period stipulated in Articles 4 and 5 of this plan, if there are still prisoners of war under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the method of handling them shall be negotiated and resolved by the political conference stipulated in Article 4, Paragraph 60 of the armistice agreement.

    7.  All expenses incurred by the prisoners of war during the period of custody by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, including their travel expenses back to their country, shall be borne by the country to which the prisoners of war belong.

    8.  The terms of this plan and the arrangements arising therefrom shall be made known to all prisoners of war.”

    The other side suggested adjourning the meeting until 11:00 a.m. on May 9th in order to study our side's new plan, and our side agreed.

    为了解决战俘问题促成朝鲜停战
    我方又作重大建设性努力
    【新华社开城七日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月七日发表公报如下：
    五月七日的双方代表团大会上，我方为了促成朝鲜停战，对整个战俘问题的解决又作了重大的建设性的努力。由于对方在过去十天的谈判中，固执地坚持把不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜，由中立国临时收管的前提，使朝鲜停战的实现又要因步骤和方法上的问题受到阻碍，使世界人民对朝鲜停战的渴望再次受到打击，因此，我方除保留四月二十六日我方所提出的将不直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去的方案外，并试图采用对方的前提：提出了另一新的方案。
    南日大将在五月七日的会上说：
    “我方四月二十六日提出的具体实施方案中关于不直接遣返的其余战俘的处理是建立在将不直接遣返的其余战俘送到中立国去的前提上的。但过去十天以来谈判会议的讨论证明：你方想用首先解决中立国提名的问题来模糊我方的这一前提，意图借此来实现你方所提的另外一个前提，即将不直接遣返的其余战俘留在朝鲜而由中立国到朝鲜来加以接管的前提。
    我们认为上述两个前提是完全不同的，在不同的前提之下应该有不同的处理方案。我方的方案是要将不直接遣返的朝中战俘送到中立国去，从你方原来的控制下释放出来由中立国加以接管；然后，经过我方派人去中立国对他们进行解释，使他们得以解除疑惧因而有表示其意志的可能；然后，凡其中提出要求遣返的一切战俘应由有关中立国当局保证将其遣返祖国。而你方的方案则是要将不直接遣返的其余战俘继续留在拘留一方控制的地区之内。这显然将使这些战俘不可能从拘留一方的控制下完全解脱出来，而中立国去到拘留一方所控制的地区内对你方所说的大量战俘进行接管也将遭遇很大的困难。同时，这一情况更将使有关方面的解释工作不能得到应有的自由和便利。以两个方案相比，我方方案是最能体现一九四九年日内瓦公约原则和国际惯例使战俘遣返问题得到公正而合理的解决的。
    但是，在过去十天来的讨论中，你方固执地坚持你方所提出的将不直接遣返的其余战俘继续留在朝鲜而由中立国到朝鲜来加以接管的前提。鉴于你方这一固执行为将使朝鲜停战的实现又要因步骤和方法上的问题而受到阻碍，从而使双方有子弟在朝鲜作战的人民以及全世界爱好和平人民对于朝鲜停战的渴望再次受到打击，因此，我现在声明：我们将继续保留我方在四月二十六日提出的方案，但同时准备在你方接受我方现在提出的下列的新方案的条件之下，试图采用你方的前提，即将不直接遣返的其余战俘继续留在原拘留地交由中立国来进行遣返的安排。我应当指出我方四月二十六日所提的方案，和这个在你方前提下所做成的新方案相比，仍然是较为合理的。
    我方新方案内容如下：
    一、在停战协定生效后两个月内，双方应依照停战协定第三条第五十一款的有关规定，并根据双方所交换并校正的最后名单，将一切坚持遣返的战俘分批遣返，交给战俘所属一方，不得加以任何阻难。
    二、为了协助不直接遣返的其余战俘回返家乡，双方同意建立一个中立国遣返委员会，由停战协定第二条第三十七款所规定的四个国家，即波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士、瑞典及双方同意的印度，共五个国家各派同等数目的代表组成。
    三、双方全部战俘，除本方案第一条所规定的应予直接遣返者外，应在原拘留地点从拘留一方的军事控制和收容下释放出来，交由本方案第二条所规定的中立国遣返委员会接收和看管。中立国遣返委员会应有执行其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力。为保证此项权力的有效实施，中立国遣返委员会成员国应各自配备同等数目的武装力量。
    四、中立国遣返委员会在接管不直接遣返的战俘之后，应即进行安排，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利在自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的四个月期限内，派人前往此项战俘的原拘留地点向一切依附于该所属国的战俘解释，消除他们的顾虑，并通知战俘任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全的权利。
    五、在自中立国遣返委员会接管战俘之日起的四个月内，经其所属国家的解释之后，凡提出要求遣返回家的一切战俘，应由中立国遣返委员会负责协助他们迅速返回祖国，拘留方不得留难。此项战俘的遣返的行政细节，应由中立国遣返委员会与双方协商解决。
    六、在本方案第四条和第五条所规定的四个月期满之后，如尚有在中立国遣返委员会看管之下的战俘，其处理办法应交由停战协定第四条第六十款所规定的政治会议协商解决。
    七、战俘在中立国遣返委员会看管期内的一切费用，包括其回国旅费在内，应由战俘的所属国负担之。
    八、本方案的条款及由此而产生的安排应使全部战俘知晓。”
    对方建议休会至五月九日上午十一时，以便对我方新方案加以研究，我方表示同意。
