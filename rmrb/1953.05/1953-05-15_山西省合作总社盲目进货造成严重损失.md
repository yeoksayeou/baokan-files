The Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Society Suffers Severe Losses Due to Blind Procurement

During the North China Regional Materials Exchange Conference last October, the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Society blindly engaged in "large-scale buying and selling," entering into numerous contracts, over a third of which could not be fulfilled. This resulted in penalties everywhere and severe commodity stockpiling. Preliminary statistics for excess payments and stockpiled, rotten goods indicate a total loss of 3,718,180,000 yuan.

The delegation from Shanxi Province attending the North China Regional Materials Exchange Conference was headed by Lin Nan, Deputy Director of the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Society. Before attending the conference, they did not make adequate preparations and hastily formulated a purchasing and sales plan that lacked a sound basis. During the exchange meeting, Lin Nan blindly responded to the call for "large-scale buying and selling," instructing the representatives to buy more goods, saying, "If I receive any punishment or criticism on this matter, I will be responsible. If you are afraid of not being able to explain yourselves when you return, I will write you a letter of proof." After learning of this situation, the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Society sent personnel to Tianjin to stop Lin Nan's blind buying spree. Not only did Lin Nan not listen, but he continued to buy goods indiscriminately in Tianjin. At that time, cooperatives at all levels were hesitant to buy in large quantities, but Lin Nan, in order to demonstrate "grandeur," decided that the provincial cooperative would "take it all on," personally directing purchasing agents to buy department store goods and stationery. When reporting on transactions each day, he only paid attention to quantity and amount, disregarding quality and price. They originally planned to purchase 16.9 billion yuan worth of goods but ended up transacting 123.4 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by more than six times. Among the purchased goods, more than 50,000 catties of oranges were frozen and spoiled. After being distributed to lower-level cooperatives, they could not be sold; the An'yi and Jincheng county cooperatives distributed them to cadres to eat. When transacting for stationery, they thought, "With the anti-illiteracy campaign starting, who wouldn't buy a notebook! Even old women will want to carry a pen!" In Tianjin, they transacted stationery worth a total of 19.5 billion yuan, exceeding the total sales of stationery for the entire year of 1952 by 77.5 percent and exceeding the purchase plan by more than 16 times. Based on current sales, the notebooks they purchased will take more than five years to sell out completely. Regarding means of production, the management department asked them to buy bone meal, but they did not. Instead, they signed a contract to purchase 3.2 billion yuan worth of pesticides. Because they lacked the funds and loans for this, they have been unable to fulfill the contract and have been fined.

At the conference, they unilaterally favored neighboring regions and showed unprincipled consideration for private merchants, causing unnecessary losses. They purchased 1,500 pounds of Yulin wool, which arrived in Taiyuan after the season, and each pound was 2,000 yuan more expensive than the same quality wool produced in Taiyuan.

We suggest that the province appropriately resolve these problems, give Lin Nan and other responsible persons the punishment they deserve, actively organize sales and clean-up of stockpiled and rotten goods, and appropriately revoke some of the contracts that have not yet expired or are being implemented, based on the principle of mutual benefit for both parties to the contract.

### 山西省合作总社盲目进货造成严重损失

    山西省合作总社盲目进货造成严重损失
    山西省合作总社在去年十月参加华北区物资交流大会时，盲目地“大买大卖”，和各方面订了许多合同，但有三分之一以上不能履行。因此，到处受罚，并造成严重的商品积压。根据超额货款及积压、霉烂商品的初步统计，共损失三十七亿一千八百一十八万元。
    山西省参加华北区物资交流大会的代表团，是以山西省合作总社副主任林南为首组成的。在参加大会之前，他们没有进行充分的准备，仅草率地制定了一个缺乏根据的购销计划。在交流会中，林南盲目响应“大买大卖”的号召，让代表们多买货，并说：“如果在这个问题上受了处分和批评由我负责；怕回去交代不了，我给你们写证明信。”山西省合作总社知道这种情况后，曾派人赴天津制止林南这种盲目大买的行为，林南不但不听，却在天津继续乱买货品。当时各级社都不敢大买，林南为了显示“气派大”，竟决定由省社“包下来”，亲自指挥采购员购买百货文具。每天报告成交情况时，只听数量、金额，不管质量、价格。他们原计划采购一百六十九亿元的商品，结果成交了一千二百三十四亿元，超过原计划六倍以上。在购进的商品中，橘子冻坏了五万余斤，发到下级社以后，卖不出去；安邑、晋城县社就分给干部吃了。在成交文具的时候，他们认为“扫除文盲运动开始，谁不买个笔记本！老太太也要带只钢笔！”他们在天津成交文具总值一百九十五亿元，超过一九五二年全年文具销货总额的百分之七十七点五，超过购进计划的十六倍以上。他们购买的笔记本，按现在销售情况，要五年多才能全部销尽。关于生产资料，经理部让他们买骨粉，他们没有买，却签订了购买值三十二亿元农药的合同，因无此项资金与贷款，至今不能履行合同，就被罚款了。
    他们在会上片面照顾友邻区和无原则地照顾私商，也造成了不应有的损失。他们购进榆林毛线一千五百磅，货发到太原，就过了季节，每磅还高于太原生产的同质毛线两千元。
    我们建议该省适当地解决这些问题，予林南等负责者以应得的处分；对积压、霉烂的商品，积极组织推销和加以清理；对尚未到期和正在执行中的合同，应在合同双方两利的原则下适当撤销一部。
