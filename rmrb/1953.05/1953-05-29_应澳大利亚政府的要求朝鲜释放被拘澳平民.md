I was always free to move around and maintained good health with the help of various medical facilities. Therefore, I have always expressed unlimited gratitude to the many administrators responsible for taking care of me."

    It is reported that Philip Crosbie previously resided in Hongcheon County in the southern half of Korea and was detained by the Korean side after the US-Syngman Rhee bandit gang launched the war.

    应澳大利亚政府的要求朝鲜释放被拘澳平民
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省在二十六日发表公报如下：
    今年四月三十日，苏联政府把澳大利亚政府关于释放和遣返被扣留在北朝鲜的澳大利亚平民的要求转达给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府审查了上述要求，并通过了肯定的决定。因此已于五月二十六日在中华人民共和国安东市，把被扣留的澳大利亚平民一名移交给苏联代表，使他得以返回本国。
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府最近释放的澳大利亚传教士菲利普·克罗斯贝，对于朝鲜政府给予他的照顾，表示深切的感谢。他说：“我和已经返国的英国人一样，得到了丰富的饮食和文娱生活的保证。我一直可以自由行动，并且在各种医疗条件的帮助下经常保持着健康。因而，我一直对负责照顾我的许多管理人员，表示无限的感激。”
    按菲利普·克罗斯贝以前居留在朝鲜南半部洪川郡，在美李匪帮发动战争后，被朝方拘留。
