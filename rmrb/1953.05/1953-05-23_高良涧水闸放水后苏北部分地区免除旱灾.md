The Gaoliangjian intake sluice gate on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, completed in the 1952 Huai River Harnessing Project, has played a role in diverting water for irrigation this year. On May 14, the Gaoliangjian intake sluice gate released water to irrigate farmland, saving parts of northern Jiangsu from drought and maintaining the navigation of the Grand Canal.

Since the beginning of spring this year, there has been a general lack of rainfall in northern Jiangsu, and the water level of the Grand Canal has been declining, seriously affecting farmland irrigation and inland waterway navigation. In order to support the masses in production, disaster relief, and drought resistance, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, upon approval from higher-level leading organs, decided to rapidly close the temporary grass dam in the ongoing Sanhe Sluice Gate project, in addition to simultaneously rushing to build temporary river dams on the waterways where the Grand Canal enters the Yangtze River and where the Chuanjiang River enters the sea, in order to reduce the drainage of river water from the counties east of the Grand Canal in Lixiahe. This grass dam is seven li long. After its closure, the earthen dam of the Sanhe Sluice Gate project can be easily blocked. More importantly, it cut off the flow of water from Hongze Lake into the Yangtze River from Sanhe, raising the water level of Hongze Lake so that lake water could flow into the Subei Irrigation Main Canal and the Li Canal through the Gaoliangjian intake sluice gate. At 6:00 PM on May 12, the grass dam lying across Hongze Lake was successfully closed after five days and five nights of struggle by 10,000 civilian workers, and the water level of Hongze Lake gradually rose. On the evening of the 14th, the Gaoliangjian intake sluice gate began to release water. As of now, the flow of Hongze Lake into the Subei Irrigation Main Canal and the Grand Canal has reached 30 cubic meters per second. The lake water is still flowing eastward continuously. After the water release, the drought situation in Huai'an, Baoying, Gaoyou and other counties along the Grand Canal has been basically alleviated. In Huai'an and Baoying counties alone, 900,000 mu of farmland have been irrigated. The tender green seedlings are growing, and the enthusiasm of the peasant masses for production is even higher. Feng Hengshan, a peasant from Zhaozhuang Village, Huai'an County, said: "In previous years, there was no water in the river at this time, and we could only wait, generally delaying the rice transplanting season by ten days. Since Chairman Mao led the harnessing of the Huai River, and the Gaoliangjian intake sluice gate was built last year, people have become the masters of water." Now large wooden boats carrying 40 to 50 tons can pass through the Grand Canal, and edible salt sold outside the Huaibei Salt Field, as well as grain for disaster relief, are being transported continuously, changing the phenomenon of navigation suspension on the Grand Canal that occurred in previous years.

### 高良涧水闸放水后苏北部分地区免除旱灾

    高良涧水闸放水后苏北部分地区免除旱灾
    一九五二年治淮工程中完工的苏北灌溉总渠上的高良涧进水闸，今年已发挥引水灌溉的作用。五月十四日高良涧进水闸放水灌溉农田，挽救了苏北部分地区的旱灾，并维持了运河的航运。
    今年入春以来，苏北地区普遍缺雨，运河水位又日渐下降，严重影响农田灌溉和内河航运。江苏省人民政府为了支持群众的生产救灾和抗旱斗争，经报请上级领导机关批准，除在运河入江水道和串场河入海水道上同时抢筑临时性的拦河坝以减少运河以东里下河各县河水的宣泄量外，并决定将现在正在进行的三河闸工程中的临时草坝迅速合龙。这件草坝长七里，合龙后可使三河闸工程中的拦河土坝容易堵闭，更重要的是截断了洪泽湖从三河入江的水流，用以抬高洪泽湖水位，使湖水经高良涧进水闸流入苏北灌溉总渠和里运河。五月十二日下午六时，横卧洪泽湖的草坝经一万民工奋斗五天五夜后胜利合龙，洪泽湖水位逐渐抬高。十四日晚，高良涧进水闸开始放水。到目前为止，洪泽湖进入苏北灌溉总渠和运河的流量已达三十秒立方公尺。湖水仍在源源东流。放水以后，运河沿线的淮安、宝应、高邮等县已基本解除旱象，仅淮安、宝应两县即有九十万亩农田得到灌溉。嫩绿的秧苗正在生长，农民群众的生产情绪更加高涨。淮安县赵庄村农民冯衡山说：“往年这时，河里没水，只有干等，一般要把插秧季节推迟十天。自从毛主席领导治淮河，去年修好了高良涧进水闸后，人便当了水的家了。”现在运河里已能通行载重四五十吨的大木船，淮北盐场外销的食盐以及救济灾区的粮食正在源源不断载运，往年这时运河停航的现象已改变了。
