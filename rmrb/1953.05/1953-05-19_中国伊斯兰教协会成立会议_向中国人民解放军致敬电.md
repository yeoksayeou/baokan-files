To the Respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

    We are minority nationalities who believe in Islam. Since liberation, under the brilliant illumination of Chairman Mao's ethnic and religious policies, we have been living a happy life that we have never had before. With the leap forward of the motherland, our various nationalities have also made great progress. Our future is infinitely vast and bright!

    When we live a happy life, we often think of you. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, you helped us liberate ourselves from the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and then helped us restore and develop production, and earnestly and conscientiously respect our religious beliefs and customs. All this fills us with unspeakable gratitude. You are the kinsmen of our minority nationalities and the protectors of the interests of all our nationalities. For more than three years, when we see you steadfastly defending the motherland and defending world peace, how happy and proud we are!

    On the occasion of the official establishment of the China Islamic Association, we would like to extend our cordial greetings to you!

    Inaugural Meeting of the China Islamic Association

    中国伊斯兰教协会成立会议
    向中国人民解放军致敬电敬爱的朱总司令转中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    我们是信仰伊斯兰教的少数民族，解放以来，在毛主席的民族政策和宗教政策光辉照耀下，我们过着从来没有过的幸福的生活，随着祖国的跃进，我们各民族也有了很大的进步，我们的前途是无限的远大和光明！
    当我们过着幸福生活的时候，常常想念到你们。你们在毛主席的领导下，帮助我们从国民党反动派压迫下解放出来，接着又帮助我们恢复和发展生产，并且切实认真地尊重我们的宗教信仰和风俗习惯。这一切，使我们有说不尽感激的心情。你们是我们少数民族的亲人，是我们各民族人民利益的保卫者。三年多来，当我们看到你们坚强地保卫着祖国，保卫着世界和平的时候，我们是多么高兴、多么骄傲！
    值此中国伊斯兰教协会正式成立之际，我们谨向你们致以亲切的敬礼！
    中国伊斯兰教协会成立会议
