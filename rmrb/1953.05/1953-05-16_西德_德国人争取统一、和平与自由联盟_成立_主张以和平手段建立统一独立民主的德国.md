Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The German News Agency reported that a special meeting was convened in Düsseldorf, West Germany, on May 10th under the initiative of the "Federation of the German Movement for Unity, Peace, and Freedom," announcing the establishment of a new political party: "League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom."

More than 200 people participated in the meeting, including representatives from the "Federation of the German Movement for Unity, Peace, and Freedom" and prominent figures from West German political, economic, and cultural circles.

Former German Imperial Chancellor Dr. Joseph Wirth and former Mayor Wilhelm Elfes were elected as chairmen of the "League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom." The League also elected an executive committee consisting of Joseph Wirth, Wilhelm Elfes, Dr. Lange of Brunswick, and Pastor Oberhoff of Bremen.

A communiqué issued by the meeting stated that the new political party will actively participate in future Federal Parliament elections and put forward its own list of candidates.

The communiqué stated that the new political party's goal is to achieve the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic Germany through peaceful means; to guarantee the welfare of all people, ensure social justice and national security; to establish a Germany free from enslavement and threats to peace, and to establish friendly relations with all countries that respect Germany's independence and sovereignty.

The new political party issued a declaration to the people of West Germany, stating: "The League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom" is a broad united organization of all Germans regardless of social status, profession, religious belief, or party affiliation; it is determined to overthrow the Adenauer regime, which subordinates German interests to the hegemonic policies of the United States, and replace it with a strong government composed of Germans who fully understand their responsibilities to the country. The League demands: that the people of East and West Germany reach an agreement on the common and significant demands of the German people to the victorious powers, draft an all-German election law in order to hold free all-German elections as soon as possible, convene an all-German People's Congress and form a democratic government; declare the Bonn and Paris Treaties as invalid; conclude a peace treaty with Germany; withdraw all occupying forces; and abolish all trade barriers and restrictions.

The League held a press conference on the 11th. Elfes pointed out in his speech that the new political party's view on international issues is consistent with the principles put forward by the Vienna World People's Peace Congress. The League favors solving problems through political means rather than military means. It calls for an agreement to be reached between the occupying powers and the Germans.

The first issue of the League's organ, the "German People's Daily," which contains Wirth's articles and the League's declaration, was published on the 12th.

    西德“德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟”成立
    主张以和平手段建立统一独立民主的德国
    【新华社十五日讯】据德意志通讯社报道：在“德国争取统一、和平与自由运动”联合会的发起下，五月十日在西德的杜塞尔多夫召开了一次特别会议，会上宣布成立新政党：“德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟”。
    参加这次会议的有“德国争取统一、和平与自由运动”联合会的代表们以及西德著名政治、经济与文化界人士共二百多人。
    前德意志帝国总理约瑟夫·维尔特博士和前市长威廉·艾尔费斯被选为“德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟”主席。联盟并选出了由约瑟夫·维尔特，威廉·艾尔费斯，不伦瑞克的朗格博士和不来梅的奥柏霍甫牧师组成的执行委员会。
    会议发表的公报说，新政党将积极参加未来的联邦议院选举，并提出自己的候选名单。
    公报说，新政党的目的是通过和平手段达到建立一个统一的、独立的、民主的德国；保证全体人民的福利、保证社会正义与国家的安全；建立一个摆脱奴役和对和平的威胁的德国，并与所有尊重德国的独立与主权的国家建立友好关系。
    新政党发表了告西德人民的宣言，宣言说：“德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟”是不分社会地位、职业、宗教信仰和党派关系的全体德国人的广泛联合的组织；它决定推翻使德国利益从属于美国强权政策的阿登纳政权，而代之以一个由充分了解对于国家的责任的德国人所组成的强有力的政府。联盟要求：东西德人民之间就有关德国人民对战胜国的共同与重大的要求达成协议，起草一个全德选举法以便尽早地举行全德自由选举，召开全德国民议会并组成一个民主政府；宣布波恩与巴黎条约为无效；缔结对德和约；撤退一切占领军；取消一切贸易上的障碍与限制。
    联盟于十一日举行了记者招待会。艾尔费斯在会上发言指出，新政党对于国际间问题的看法是与维也纳世界人民和平大会所提出的原则一致的。联盟赞成用政治方式而不用军事方式来解决问题。它要求在占领国之间和德国人之间达成协议。
    载有维尔特的文章和联盟宣言的联盟机关报“德国人民报”第一期已于十二日出版。
