The Shenyang Nanhu construction site of the Second Engineering Company of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau, in carrying out the anti-waste and responsibility system establishment campaign, closely integrated it with the current work. As a result, it gradually changed the serious chaotic situation at the beginning of the construction and basically eliminated the phenomena of idling and rework. The progress of the project can now be carried out according to the instructed charts.

The Shenyang Nanhu construction site is one of the key projects of the company. Since construction started on April 15th, due to insufficient construction preparation and chaotic on-site management, technical personnel did not go to the site, resulting in a rework incident of 14,000 bricks on the second day of construction. Fifteen rework incidents and twenty-three major and minor security incidents occurred continuously in twenty-five days. Furthermore, because various types of work did not have dedicated construction personnel to do the preparation work, and auxiliary types of work were not well coordinated, idling occurred frequently. For example, bricklayers often waited for ash and slurry due to insufficient supply, idling eighteen times in twenty-five days. The continuous occurrence of rework and idling resulted in the actual progress being seven days behind schedule, and management expenses wasted reached 350 million yuan. The phenomenon of no one being responsible led to the imbalance of on-site technical supply work, unreasonable labor organization, and a situation where work procedures could not adapt to each other, which hindered the improvement of workers' labor efficiency. For example, bricklayers only reached 58 percent of the quota, and carpenters reached 40 percent of the quota. Workers' enthusiasm for production therefore declined. Workers' actual wage income also decreased. In particular, apprentices did not even have enough money to eat, causing ideological confusion among workers.

When the construction site launched the anti-waste and establishment of responsibility system campaign in late April, it first studied the specific situation of the construction site and decided that it must start by solving the most important problems in the current work—reversing the serious rework and idling situation. Leading cadres deeply analyzed the root causes of the current rework and idling phenomena. From the fifteen rework accidents, it was found that twelve of them were caused by no one being responsible for technical management. Therefore, it was proposed that technical management must be strengthened and a technical responsibility system established in the campaign to establish the responsibility system.

In order to change the phenomenon of no one being responsible for technical management, the company emphasized the need to do a good job in mobilizing technical personnel. First, it is necessary to understand their ideological situation, dispel their concerns that "the movement will turn around and they will be criticized again," thereby improving their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. At a symposium, workers not only exposed the phenomenon of no one being responsible for construction management, but also earnestly requested the technical director to go to the site to do a good job in on-site technical guidance work, so as to change the state of no one being responsible for on-site technical management. At the same time, they also reviewed their own ideas of pursuing quantity and neglecting quality, and expressed that they would definitely obey the technical guidance of construction personnel and strictly implement operating procedures in the future. At the meeting, technical personnel and staff also took the initiative to conduct self-criticism. Thanks to the active participation of technical personnel and staff in the movement, many key issues have been resolved.

According to the problems exposed by workers, technical personnel, and staff, the leaders of the construction site analyzed them and, after discussion by the masses, decided to first establish a technical quality responsibility system. The main contents are: 1. Blueprint review system. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening, the site's dedicated technical staff will be the main reviewers of various blueprints. 2. Establish a construction responsibility system for major types of work. Each major type of work will designate dedicated construction personnel to be responsible for organizing the coordination of various types of work, doing a good job in preparation, and being fully responsible for the progress and quality of major work. 3. Technical review responsibility system. After important techniques are arranged by the construction personnel, they must be reviewed by dedicated technical personnel and deemed qualified before construction can begin. 4. Handover inspection system. When the front and rear work procedures are handed over, the construction personnel will conduct quality inspections with the team leader of the workers, and after completing the handover procedures, the next work procedure can be carried out. 5. Inspection and scoring system. The construction personnel and the team leader will conduct inspections on quality, progress, and savings, and conduct one inspection every day and one evaluation every ten days. The results will be used as the basis for assessing performance.

Due to the establishment and improvement of the technical responsibility system, conditions have been created for promoting advanced experience. The construction site immediately discussed quotas, formulated a small-group cyclical flow operation plan in the process of establishing the responsibility system movement, and mobilized workers to create new tools and improve operating methods. This directly promoted the on-site construction work, and the on-site appearance was renewed. On May 17th, the construction site held another cadre meeting to prepare to absorb the experience of the previous stage and further comprehensively establish various responsibility systems at the construction site.

    沈阳南湖工地在开展反浪费和建立责任制运动中
    密切结合当前工作使现场面貌一新
    东北有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司沈阳南湖工地，在开展反浪费与建立责任制运动中密切结合了当前工作，因而逐渐改变了开工初期的严重混乱局面，基本上消灭了窝工返工现象，工程进度已能按指示图表进行。
    沈阳南湖工地是该公司重点工程之一，自四月十五日开工后，由于施工准备工作做得不够周密，现场管理混乱，技术人员不下现场，以致开工第二天即发生返工一万四千块砖的事件；二十五天连续发生十五次返工事件，大小保安事故二十三次。又由于各种工种没有专责施工员做施工准备工作，辅助工种配合得不好，常有窝工现象发生。如瓦工常因灰浆供不应求而待灰待浆，二十五天中窝工十八次。返工窝工的事不断发生，实际进度就比计划拖迟了七天，管理费用浪费达三亿五千余万元。无人负责现象造成了现场技术供应工作的失调，劳动组织不合理，工序间不能互相适应的状况，这就妨碍了工人劳动效率的提高。如瓦工只达到定额的百分之五十八，木工达到定额的四十，工人生产情绪因而下降。工人实际工资收入也随之减少。特别是徒工连吃饭的钱也不够。引起工人思想混乱。
    四月下旬该工地开展反浪费与建立责任制运动时，首先研究了工地的具体情况，决定一定要从解决当前工作中最主要的问题——扭转严重的返工、窝工情况着手。领导干部深入分析了目前造成返工、窝工现象的根本原因，从十五次返工事故中发现其中有十二次是由于技术管理上无人负责所造成的，因此提出：在建立责任制运动中首先必须加强技术管理，建立技术责任制。
    为要改变技术管理上的无人负责现象，该公司强调要做好发动技术人员的工作。首先要了解他们的思想情况，打消他们的“运动反上来，又是整到头上”的顾虑，从而提高他们的积极性和责任心。在一个座谈会上，工人除揭发了施工管理上无人负责的现象外，并恳切提出了要求技术主任下现场做好现场技术指导工作，以改变现场技术管理无人负责的状态。同时也检讨了自己追求数量忽视质量的凑数思想，并表示今后一定服从施工员的技术指导，严格执行操作规程。在会上，技术人员和职员也主动进行了自我批评。由于技术人员和职员的积极参加运动，许多关键性问题得到了解决。
    根据工人与技术人员、职员揭发出来的问题，工地领导方面加以分析并经群众讨论后，决定首先要订立技术质量责任制，其主要内容有：一、图纸会审制。每周一、三、五晚间，以工地专责技术员为主会审各种图纸。二、建立主要工种的施工负责制。各主要工种指定专责施工员，负责组织各工种配合，做好准备工作，并对主要工作之进度与质量负全责。三、技术复查负责制。重要技术由施工员布置后，均需经专责技术员复查认为合格后，方得施工。四、交接检验制度。先后工序交接班时，由施工员会同工人组长，进行质量检查，办理交接手续后，下一工序才能施工。五、检查评分制。由施工员与小组长进行质量、进度、节约等检查，每日
    一查，十日一评。把结果作为考核成绩的依据。
    由于建立与健全了技术责任制，就为推广先进经验创造了条件。该工地即在建立责任制运动中，讨论了定额，制订了小组循环流水作业计划，并发动工人创造新工具、改进操作方法。这样就直接推进了现场的施工工作，现场面貌为之一新。五月十七日工地又召开了干部会议，准备吸取前一阶段经验，进一步全面地建立工地各项责任制。
