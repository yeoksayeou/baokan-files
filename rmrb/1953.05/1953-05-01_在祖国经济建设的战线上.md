Northeast Nearly One Million Workers Launch Labor Emulation Drive

In early April, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to actively carry out competitions to welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. Workers in various places responded enthusiastically. As of April 25th, nearly one million workers in state-owned and local state-owned factories, mines, construction sites, railways, and forestry in the Northeast had been involved in the enthusiastic labor emulation drive.

Among the industrial cities in the Northeast, Shenyang was the first to launch the competition. As early as April 13th, the famous Shenyang Model Factory No. 53 Factory, as well as the Smelting Plant, Machine Tool Factory No. 1, Machine Tool Factory No. 6, Electrical Engineering Factory No. 5, etc., announced their competition conditions at a competition mobilization broadcast jointly held by the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions and Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station. Subsequently, factories throughout the city responded one after another. By the 20th, 110,000 workers in 90 units throughout the city had joined the competition. Following Shenyang's launch of the competition, workers in industrial cities such as Anshan, Harbin, Dalian, Fushun, Benxi, Jilin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Fuxin, Liaoyuan, as well as railway and forestry workers, also launched a vigorous competition with unprecedented enthusiasm. Following the launch of the competition in major industrial cities, local state-owned factories and mines in smaller cities, and even drilling teams active in remote mountainous areas, also initiated competitions. At this point, a magnificent competition movement on a Northeast-wide scale was fully launched.

Although the competition has been underway for less than twenty days, it has already yielded fruitful results. This is not only reflected in the fact that many factories (such as Factory No. 53, Electrical Engineering Factory No. 8, etc.) have completed their April national production plans ahead of schedule, but also in the emergence of a large number of new innovations. For example, the Second and Third Workshops of the Dalian Chemical Plant had 263 rationalization proposals and tips in the first ten days of the competition. One tip alone, which improved the boiler's air supply capacity, can create an additional 3.6 billion yuan of wealth for the country each year (calculated based on the increased air supply of a boiler that supplies more than 4,000 cubic meters of air per hour after implementing this tip). Another example is Liu Enkui, a laboratory technician at the Liaoxi Cement Plant, who created a vaporizer and a rapid strength analysis method during the competition, shortening the analysis time from 28 days to 29 hours. As for the deeds of Fu Jinshan, an old lathe operator at Machine Tool Factory No. 1, who implemented high-speed pick-off when machining the 470 main shaft, increasing production efficiency by six times and achieving 100% quality, are too numerous to mention.

Currently, the competition is continuing to develop. The vast number of workers in the region are confidently determined to dedicate better production achievements to the "May Day" Labor Day and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

Nationwide Coal Mine Workers Actively Improve Work

Xinhua News Agency -- Nationwide coal mine workers are actively improving their work in the patriotic labor emulation drive to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

Basic construction units and production units in the Fushun Coal Mine have launched a safe production competition. At the Fuxin Coal Mine, the Zhu Wei electric pick team, which is building the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, completed the April rock stripping plan of 88,000 cubic meters eleven days ahead of schedule on April 19th due to improved work. In early April, workers at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine began to study and promote the decisive Soviet three major safety systems and the large-face cycle operation chart management, rapid drilling, Ma Liuhai team's multi-channel rapid cycle tunneling, Liu Jiuxue team's safe production, and other experiences. To welcome "May Day" and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, all workers at the Pingxiang Coal Mine participated in the discussion and formulation of advanced production plans, and formulated advanced and feasible annual production plans. Workers at the Kailuan Coal Mine are deeply engaged in the 500,000-ton safe production campaign. The 6509 heading of the Zhaogezhuang Mine adjusted the labor organization, strengthened the connection and cooperation of the three shifts, and achieved a daily tunneling of 28.5 meters with hand picks, which increased the efficiency by 23.8% compared with the original plan.

Railway Workers Aiding Korea Actively Launch Labor Emulation Drives

Xinhua News Agency -- The Chinese People's Volunteer Army railway workers fighting on the railway transport lines in northern Korea are welcoming "May Day" International Labor Day with a high degree of heroism and labor enthusiasm. The 100-day accident-free red flag competition, launched to overcome enemy air raids and sabotage of railway transportation and improve transportation efficiency, is being widely carried out among railway workers on various lines. Before "May Day," 85 large and small stations have reached or exceeded this competition goal. When the competition started, a certain station's shunting team proposed "a thousand miles without accidents," the switch team proposed "a thousand switches without accidents," and the car numbering team proposed "ten thousand miles without accidents." Now they have maintained 362 days without accidents and have won a red flag awarded by the leading organization. Many railway workers have actively sought tips and ideas in the labor emulation drive, which has greatly improved transportation efficiency and saved a lot of wealth. A certain locomotive team safely traveled 10,000 kilometers, exceeded the axle load by 1,377.5 tons, prevented four major accidents, and saved more than 49,800 kilograms of coal in the three months from January to March this year.

Workers of All Ethnic Groups in Lhasa Launch Production Competition

Xinhua News Agency -- Workers of Tibetan, Han, and Hui ethnic groups in Lhasa are welcoming "May Day" with joyful moods. Iron, leather, sewing, and other factories affiliated with the Tibet Military Region are carrying out production competition activities to commemorate Red May. Workers in the iron factory are stepping up the manufacture of iron farm implements suitable for production conditions in Tibet. Sewing and leather workers have completed a large number of summer clothes and shoes ahead of schedule. In addition to preparing to hold a grand commemorative meeting on May 1st, workers of all ethnic groups are also preparing to hold a gala evening and various ball games. Now, workers go to the Linka (park) on the banks of the Lhasa River every afternoon to practice and rehearse various dances and new dramas. The workers have also written to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to unite closely and build Tibet together.

Modern Water Purification Equipment Completed in Tianjin

Xinhua News Agency -- The new rapid filtration system water purification equipment project of the Tianjin Water Supply Company was completed 45 days ahead of schedule and began discharging water on the eve of "May Day." The completion of this equipment has completely solved the water problem for more than two million people and industrial production in Tianjin.

The construction of this modern water purification equipment began in July 1952. Its water output capacity reaches 100,000 tons per day, more than double the water output capacity of all existing water purification equipment. The new water purification equipment has many improvements compared with the old equipment, and the heavy physical labor of the workers has been replaced by modern machines and hydraulic automatic equipment. For example, in the past, when opening various brake gates, three workers had to go under the sedimentation tank and turn them by hand more than 30 times. Now all the gates are concentrated on a management platform, and one worker can open all the brake gates by flicking a hand. In terms of statistics on inflow, filtration, and outflow, automatic recording equipment has been added, and various statistical figures can be reflected on the management platform at any time. Machines have also been added in filtration, disinfection, and transportation.

Old Workers of Shanghai Tobacco Company Machinery Factory and Other Factories Create New Production Achievements

Xinhua News Agency -- Old workers from the Shanghai Tobacco Company Machinery Factory, Hudong Shipyard, and English United Shipyard have created new production achievements to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day. In the workshop of the Shanghai Tobacco Company Machinery Factory, many gray-haired old workers are wearing wide-brimmed reading glasses and working with concentration. They have successfully manufactured the first batch of No. 3 universal milling machines, and the quality of the milling heads has reached the international first-class standard. The difference in the milled workpieces does not exceed one minute and thirty seconds, which is only equivalent to one-fifth of a hair. By April 20th, the man-hours for manufacturing crankshafts in the forging workshop of the Hudong Shipyard had been reduced by 60% compared with the end of March; the output of the new product "horn" (an important part on automobiles) had also increased by 25%. On the afternoon of April 25th, Wang Guangyao, an old worker at English United Shipyard, completed a major innovation: transforming a large planer that can only plane flat workpieces into a special planer that can plane circular arc workpieces, which increased work efficiency by three times.

These three factories are mechanical factories that the People's Government purchased or requisitioned from the British last year. They are home to a large number of veteran metalworkers with rich production experience. The average length of service of workers in the Shanghai Tobacco Company Machinery Factory is more than 15 years; the length of service of most workers in the English United Shipyard is between 20 and 40 years, and some have been working for as long as 67 years. Many of them participated in the "May 30th" Movement in 1925 and the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, and many have shed blood and been imprisoned. Over the past year, they have completed the production tasks to support the second and third years of the Huai River harnessing project in a timely manner, and have manufactured a large number of oil pipes, boiler bases, various special machines, small turbines, and barges for all parts of the country.

This year's "May Day" is the first Labor Day after they truly became the masters of the factories. In mid-April, they automatically put forward the plan to work hard to celebrate the festival. Fu Shenghua, an old lathe worker who participated in the first Chinese workers' general strike in 1922 and the "May 30th" Movement in 1925, organized many groups in the Shanghai Tobacco Company Machinery Factory where he worked in early April to trial-produce a new type of precision machine tool - the No. 3 universal milling machine, as a gift for "May Day" International Labor Day. When the forging workshop of the Hudong Shipyard was manufacturing the new product "horn", Zou A'er, an old forger who took the lead in fighting the "patrolmen" on Nanjing Road during the "May 30th" Movement, volunteered to stay by the red-hot blast furnace day and night, improving the mold and helping the workers improve their operations, so that the output increased rapidly.

Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative Launches Autumn Field Sowing Competition

Xinhua News Agency -- The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is launching an autumn field sowing competition to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day. The five agricultural labor groups participating in the competition planted a total of 48 mu of Golden Queen corn and potatoes in seven days. All 365.3 mu of autumn fields in the cooperative can be completely planted by mid-May. In the competition, each group actively sought out tips for increasing production, learned advanced experience, and further improved farming techniques. The local climate is cold, and the growing period of crops is long. In order to avoid the shortcomings of late sowing and immature grains at autumn harvest in the past, they planted Golden Queen corn 13 days earlier than last year this year. At the same time, they learned from the Soviet experience of close planting, using one-fifth more seeds per mu of Golden Queen corn than in the past, increasing the seedlings from 1,500 plants to 1,800 plants. In addition, in terms of forestry and animal husbandry, the cooperative adopted the method of classifying and grazing sheep this spring, changing the phenomenon of mixed breeding of sheep and small lambs falling behind the large sheep and not getting enough to eat in the past; and designated the South Gully, Sand Ridge, and South Linwa outside the gully as forest areas, sowing pine and cypress seeds on 120 mu of barren mountains, and planting more than 9,300 saplings of poplar, willow, apple, grape, pepper, and other trees, with a survival rate of more than 80%.

    东北近百万职工掀起劳动竞赛
    四月初，东北总工会发出为迎接“五一”，迎接中国工会第七次全国代表大会积极开展竞赛的号召后，各地职工即纷纷响应。至四月二十五日止，全东北已有近百万国营及地方国营厂、矿、工地和铁路、林业工人卷入热烈的劳动竞赛中。
    在东北各个工业城市中，掀起竞赛最早的是沈阳。早在四月十三日，沈阳全国著名的模范工厂五三工厂及冶炼厂、机械一厂、机械六厂、电工五厂等，就在沈阳市总工会和沈阳市人民广播电台联合举办的竞赛动员广播大会上宣布了自己的竞赛条件，接着，全市各厂便纷纷响应，到二十日，全市便有九十个单位的十一万职工卷入了竞赛。继沈阳展开竞赛之后，鞍山、哈尔滨、旅大、抚顺、本溪、吉林、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、阜新、辽源等工业城市的职工和铁路、林业的职工也都以空前未有的热情，相继展开了如火如荼的竞赛。继各主要工业城市展开竞赛之后，各小城市的地方国营厂、矿，甚至活动在偏僻山区的钻探队，也都发起了竞赛。至此，一个全东北规模的壮阔的竞赛运动便全面展开了。
    竞赛展开虽然还不到二十几天，但已收到丰硕的成果。这不仅表现在许多工厂（如五三工厂、电工八厂等）已提前完成了四月份国家生产计划，而且也表现在大量新创造的出现上。如大连化学厂第二、第三车间在展开竞赛头十天内就出现了二百六十三件合理化建议与窍门，其中仅某一项提高锅炉送风能的窍门，每年就能给国家多创造三十六亿元的财富
    （按一台每小时送风四千余立方公尺风的锅炉，推行了这一窍门后增加的送风量计算）。又如辽西水泥厂化验员刘恩奎，在竞赛中创造了蒸沸器及快速强度分析法，使化验时间由二十八天缩短为二十九小时。至于像机械一厂老车工傅金山车四七○主轴时实行高速挑扣，生产效率提高六倍，质量达到百分之百的事迹，则举不胜举。
    目前竞赛正在继续发展。全区广大职工群众满怀信心地坚决以更好的生产成绩向“五一”劳动节和中国工会第七次全国代表大会献礼。
    全国煤矿职工积极改进工作
    全国煤矿职工，在迎接“五一”国际劳动节和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的爱国主义劳动竞赛中，积极改进工作。
    抚顺煤矿的基本建设单位和生产单位开展了安全生产竞赛运动。阜新煤矿，正在建设海州露天矿的朱伟电镐小组，由于改进了工作，在四月十九日提前十一天完成了四月份八万八千立方公尺的剥岩计划。焦作煤矿职工在四月上旬已开始学习并推广具有决定性作用的苏联三大安全制度和大掌子循环作业图表管理、快速钻进、马六孩小组多孔道快速循环掘进、刘九学组安全生产等经验。萍乡煤矿为迎接“五一”和中国工会第七次全国代表大会，全体职工参加了讨论和制订先进生产计划，订出先进的切实可行的全年生产计划。开滦煤矿职工深入开展五十万吨安全生产运动。赵各庄矿六五○九掌子，调整了劳动组织，加强了三班的联系和配合，达到手镐日掘进二十八点五公尺，比原计划效率提高了百分之二十三点八。　（新华社）
    援朝铁路职工积极开展劳动竞赛
    战斗在朝鲜北部铁道运输线上的中国人民志愿援朝铁路职工，正以高度的英勇精神和劳动热情，来迎接“五一”国际劳动节。为了战胜敌机对铁路运输的轰炸破坏和提高运输效率而开展的百日无事故红旗竞赛，正在各线路职工中普遍进行。“五一”节前，已经有八十五个大、小车站，达到了或者超过了这一竞赛目标。某车站在竞赛开始时，调车组提出了“千里无事故”，扳道组提出了“千扳无事故”，车号组提出了“万里无事故”的口号，现在他们已经保持了三百六十二天没有发生事故，并已荣获领导机关奖给的红旗一面。许多铁路职工在劳动竞赛中积极找窍门、想办法，因而大大地提高了运输效率，并且节约了不少财富。某机车组在今年一月到三月的三个月中安全行车一万公里，超轴一千三百七十七点五吨，并且防止了四件重大事故，节省煤四万九千八百多公斤。

    上海烟草公司机械厂等厂的
    老工人创造新的生产成就
    上海烟草公司机械厂、沪东造船厂和英联船厂的老年工人，创造了新的生产成就来迎接“五一”国际劳动节。上海烟草公司机械厂的车间里，很多头发斑白的老工人戴着宽边老花眼镜，全神贯注地工作着，他们已把第一批三号万能铣床制造成功，铣头的质量达到了国际甲级标准。铣出的工作物，差度不超过一分三十秒，只相等于一根头发的五分之一。沪东造船厂锻工车间制造曲轴的工时，到四月二十日已比三月底缩短了百分之六十；新产品“羊角”（汽车上的重要零件）的产量也提高了百分之二十五。英联船厂老工人王光耀在四月二十五日下午完成了一项重大创造：把仅能刨平面工作物的大刨床改装成为能刨圆弧工作物的特种刨床，使工作效率提高了三倍。
    这三个工厂是人民政府去年向英国人购买或征用来的机械工厂。这里集中着大批具有丰富的生产经验的老五金工人。上海烟草公司机械厂工人的平均工龄在十五年以上；英联船厂多数工人的工龄是在二十年到四十年之间，个别的已有六十七年之久。他们之中很多人曾经参加过一九二五年“五卅”斗争和第一次国内革命战争时期上海工人的三次武装起义，不少人曾流过血坐过牢。一年来，他们已及时地完成了支援治淮第二、三年度工程的生产任务，为全国各地制造了大量的油管、锅炉底座、各种特殊的机器和小汽轮、驳船。
    今年的“五一”，是他们真正成为工厂的主人后的第一个劳动节。四月中，他们就自动提出了庆祝节日的努力计划。参加过一九二二年中国工人第一次大罢工和一九二五年“五卅”运动的老车床工人傅声华等，在四月初就把他们所在的上海烟草公司机械厂的许多小组组织起来，试制一种新式的精密的工作母机——三号万能铣床，作为对“五一”国际劳动节的献礼。沪东造船厂锻工车间制造新产品“羊角”时，曾在“五卅”斗争中在南京路上带头和“巡捕”搏斗的老锻工邹阿二，自告奋勇不分昼夜地坚守在红红的大冶铁炉旁边，改进模子，帮助工人们改善操作，使得产量迅速提高。
