The Harbin construction sites of the First Engineering Company of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry have revealed serious formalistic flaws in the responsibility system established last year during the campaign against waste, against lack of accountability, and to establish a system of responsibility.

The formalism of the company's responsibility system established last year is manifested in four aspects: First, assigning tasks based on individuals, each "responsible," but in reality, no one is responsible. The organization of some construction sites was not determined based on the workload and engineering technology, but based on the people available, implementing a so-called system of "doing what the people are capable of." Some construction sites put engineering and planning together; some put planning and dispatching together; some handed over engineering, planning, construction, and dispatching to one person to manage concurrently, implementing so-called "centralized responsibility." The Sixth Construction Site initially assigned tasks based on individuals, with management personnel also concurrently managing technology, so although "everyone had their own responsibility," many things were not under anyone's specific responsibility. Some people mistakenly believed that the "individual responsibility system" meant "one person is responsible for one thing and does not interfere with others." For example, the First Construction Site established a technical responsibility system among technical personnel, which only stipulated the division of labor for individuals on technical issues and did not stipulate a system of layered responsibility and mutual connection. As a result, when an engineering task came, the construction site director was only responsible for handing it over to the designated construction technician, who passed it on to the construction worker, who told the team leader, and when problems occurred during the execution of the task by the workers, no one could be found to take responsibility for resolving them. What was particularly serious was that after the division of responsibilities, there was no mutual oversight. If a construction worker laid out a line incorrectly, the designated construction technician was not responsible for correcting it; if a designated engineer laid out a line incorrectly, the technical director did not intervene. Last year, during the construction of the casting factory, some houses had no doors left, and some base lines were laid out incorrectly. Construction worker Zhang Guanglin continuously caused eight technical responsibility accidents, but no one intervened, saying that "he would be responsible for his own mistakes." As a result, although the responsibility system was established, no one was responsible everywhere, so they had to establish a "linkage contract" again.

Second, responsibility without authority, making execution difficult. Many responsibility systems stipulated who was responsible for what, but how to ensure that they fulfilled this responsibility was not stipulated in the system. The personnel responsibility system of the First Construction Site stipulated that budgeting, enlargement of drawings, laying out lines, quality, etc., were all the responsibility of the construction personnel, but the construction workers on site could not direct the workers' construction operation techniques. Because the workers and team leaders only listened to the command of the worker team leaders and did not obey his leadership. Only when the material preparation was not good would the workers come to him. But when problems occurred in the project, the leadership used the responsibility system to settle accounts with the construction workers. Therefore, the workers called the construction workers "bean cake" cadres (meaning they were under pressure from both above and below). Such a construction worker responsibility system, of course, could not be implemented.

Third, too many systems, hindering the main task. The establishment of many systems of forms and reports violated the principle of "opposing lack of accountability in order to improve work," and the procedures were too cumbersome, causing many unnecessary troubles. For example, the tool team of the First Construction Site established a system for issuing tools, stipulating that workers must have the stamps of the team leader, worker team leader, and construction worker to receive tools. As a result, workers often had to stop work and wait for tools for two or three hours because they could not find someone to stamp the form. The dispatching department stipulated that the tool team should count the warehouse and make statistical reports, so the tool team stipulated that tools would not be issued after 3:00 PM every day. Therefore, tools could not be obtained after 3:00 PM.

Fourth, being responsible in "name" only, detached from reality. Some responsibility systems did not determine the person in charge based on reality but circled around the job titles, resulting in those who should be responsible not being responsible, and those who could not bear the responsibility being forced to be responsible. For example, one construction site had two directors, one was the administrative director, managing finance and employee welfare, and was stipulated to be responsible for the cost accounting of the construction site; the other was the construction director, stipulated to only manage the project progress and quality. Because the responsibility for cost accounting was borne by the administrative director, and only he could control the consumption of materials and tools, the construction site director responsible for construction and the construction workers directly responsible for construction were not directly responsible for cost accounting, which made the cost accounting responsibility system a mere formality. Another construction site established a engineering planning and construction team, handing over the responsibility for completing the progress to the planner, not handing over this responsibility to those directly responsible for construction. Only those responsible for construction were asked to be solely responsible for technology. If the task was not completed, the engineering planning team would be responsible, which created a phenomenon where no one was responsible for the construction progress.

The reason for the formalism is that the cadres did not recognize that the practical significance of establishing a responsibility system lies in improving construction site management and improving labor efficiency. Therefore, they did not thoroughly mobilize the masses, expose and analyze as many phenomena of lack of accountability as possible, find out the key problems that actually exist, and then prescribe the right medicine and lead the masses to establish various responsibility systems. Now, the construction sites have learned from past lessons, further mobilizing the masses, strengthening organizational leadership, and turning the movement of "anti-waste and anti-lack of accountability" into a stage of establishing a genuine responsibility system.

### 有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司建立责任制运动中  接受去年教训反对形式主义现象

    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司建立责任制运动中
    接受去年教训反对形式主义现象
    中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司哈尔滨各工地，在开展反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动中，暴露了去年建立的责任制有着严重的形式主义毛病。
    该公司去年建立责任制度的形式主义表现在四个方面：一、因人分事，各自“负责”，实际上无人负责。有些工地的组织不是根据工程量和工程技术来确定，而是根据人来确定，实行所谓“有什么人干什么事”的制度。有的工地把工务、计划放在一起；有的把计划、调度放在一起；有的则把工务、计划、施工、调度四件事交给一个人兼管起来，实行所谓“集中负责”。第六工地一开始就按人分事，做管理工作的也兼管技术，这样虽然是
    “人各有责”，但很多事情却是没有人负专责。有的人错误地认为“个人负责制”就是“一个人负责一件事，互不过问”。如第一工地在技术人员中建立技术责任制，就只是规定了个人在技术问题上的分工，没有规定层层负责和互相联系的制度。于是，工程任务来了，工地主任只负责交给专责施工员，专责施工员转给施工员，施工员告诉小组长，等到工人执行任务发生问题时，却找不到人负责解决。特别严重的是分工负责以后互不过问，施工员放错了线，专责施工员不负责纠正；专责工程师放错了线，技术主任又不过问。去年建筑铸工厂，有的房子没留门，有的地脚线放错了，施工员张广林连续造成八次技术责任事故，都没有人过问，说是“错了由他自己负责”。结果责任制虽然订立了，还是到处无人负责，只好又订了一次
    “联系合同”。
    二、有责无权，执行不通。很多责任制度中都规定什么人负什么责任，但如何保证他负起这种责任，制度中却没有规定。第一工地的施工人员责任制规定了预算、放大样、放线、质量等都由施工人员负责，但施工员在现场却不能指挥工人的施工操作技术。因为工人和小组长只听工人队长的指挥，而不服从他的领导。只有备料不好时工人才来找他。但当工程发生问题时，领导方面却拿责任制来和施工员算账。因此工人把施工员叫做“豆饼”干部（上下受压的意思）。这样的施工员责任制当然没法贯彻了。
    三、制度繁多，误了正事。很多制度表报的建立，违反了“反对无人负责乃是为了改进工作”的原则，手续过于繁复，造成许多不必要的麻烦。如第一工地工具组建立了一个领发工具的制度，规定工人领工具必须经过组长、工人队长和施工员盖章才能发给。结果弄得工人常常因找不到人盖章而停工等待工具两三小时。调度方面又规定要工具组清点仓库、作好统计表报，于是工具组就规定每天下午三点钟以后不发放工具。因此三点钟以后领工具就领不到了。
    四、按“名”负责，脱离实际。有些责任制度不是根据实际来确定负责人，而是在职务名称上打圈子，结果形成该负责的没有负责，负不起来责任的却硬叫他负责。如有一工地有两个主任，一个是行政主任，管理财务和职工福利，规定他担负工地成本核算的责任；另一个是施工主任，规定他只管工程进度和质量。由于成本核算的责任由行政主任负责，并且只有他才能控制材料、工具的消耗，负责施工的工地主任和直接施工的施工员就不直接对成本核算负责，这就使成本核算责任制成为有名无实的了。另外一个工地成立了工务计划、施工组，把完成进度的责任交给作计划的，不把这个责任交给直接负责施工的。只叫负责施工的人单纯负责技术，完不成任务则由工务计划组负责，这就造成施工进度无人负责的现象。
    产生形式主义的原因，是干部没有认识建立责任制的实际意义在于改进工地管理工作，提高劳动效率，因此没有深入发动群众，把各种无人负责的现象尽量揭发、分析，找出实际上存在的关键问题，然后对症下药，有领导地发动群众来建立各种责任制度。现在，各工地已接受过去的教训，进一步地发动群众，加强组织领导，将“反浪费反无人负责”的运动转入建立真正的责任制的阶段。
