    The key pilot project for universal suffrage in the Second District of Jinan City, encompassing eighteen electoral districts in the first batch, completed the population survey and voter registration (including the review of voter qualifications and the issuance of voter certificates) from the end of April to the beginning of May.

    These two tasks were carried out in conjunction with the establishment of registration stations in each electoral district, based on widespread publicity and a general understanding of the residents' situation. To facilitate the masses, the registration stations also selected two or three points based on the residents' living arrangements and adopted a mobile registration method. The steps generally involved three phases: First, deeply mobilize the masses to make preparations and create a list of courtyards and households based on the distribution of streets and courtyards; Second, organize and lead the masses to the stations for registration in batches and by zones. After registration, the population survey registration forms were compared with the courtyard and household lists to check for any omissions, the live household registrations at the police station were checked to verify the accuracy of names, and the voter registration forms were checked to verify the accuracy of the number of voters; Third, a comprehensive review was conducted, with technical cadres and residents' committee members dividing into several groups to visit households, compare the population survey registration forms with the household registration books and voter registration forms, and carefully check voter certificates one by one. The work was basically completed at this point.

    Regarding Population Survey Work

    I. Thorough preparatory work must be done. The requirements for population survey registration work are no omissions, no repetitions, and accuracy, while also facilitating the masses, minimizing the time spent by the masses, and not disrupting production. Its characteristic is that even a small mistake can affect the whole. Therefore, the leadership must pay close attention, carefully train cadres beforehand, and ensure they fully understand the political significance, tasks, and requirements of this work to overcome complacency, paralysis, and a lack of responsibility. Generally speaking, registration personnel initially believed to varying degrees that this work was "nothing," especially those who had worked with household registration, who felt that "household registration was more complicated and we could handle that, so what's so difficult about these few forms?"; some comrades also felt that "anyway, the leadership can't check everything one by one," and their attitude was extremely unserious; there were also some comrades who proposed competitions in this unfamiliar work, blindly seeking speed. Facts have proven that these ideologies and work styles are extremely harmful, errors often arise from them, and correcting these errors inevitably requires more time and effort. Secondly, widespread and in-depth publicity must also be carried out among the masses, so that the meaning, content, and methods of the population survey registration become household knowledge. If the publicity work is done well, the masses can dispel all concerns and consciously come forward to register. For example, after conducting widespread publicity, the Xiaowangfu electoral district also held residents' group discussions to further publicize and mobilize based on the masses' level of understanding and preparation, and to exchange information on preparation. The vast majority of the masses made preparations. During registration, household heads generally recorded the birthdates of all family members, and those with a large number of family members who were difficult to remember even prepared "registration drafts." Some women without names even gave themselves names, and sixty-one people consciously corrected their past false ages. However, due to insufficient publicity and mobilization in some electoral districts, it was found after registration that many people's past false ages had not been corrected. Therefore, to do a good job of population survey registration, cadres and the masses must have sufficient ideological and technical preparation.

    To facilitate the masses and ensure that the work can proceed in an orderly and smooth manner, thorough preparations should also be made in terms of organization. There is much work to be done in this regard, but the main things should be: In addition to organizing the masses to register at the station in groups and by zones, the registration station should preferably have a waiting area and be equipped with a publicist familiar with the work. The masses generally come happily, but because they are unsure of what to do, they still have many questions about this work. At this time, the publicist should warmly receive them, arrange them in order, find them seats, and introduce the situation of the registration station; then, while they are waiting, briefly explain the significance of the election, the matters to be noted during registration, and the importance of preserving the voter certificate, and can also answer questions the masses do not understand and check the preparation of the masses. Therefore, the training of the publicist should be done in advance. Wherever this was done, it facilitated the progress of the work and was well received by the masses.

    Since we have no experience in this area and the work requires no errors, in addition to encouraging registration personnel to study the documents carefully, we first selected one electoral district to conduct a trial, and after obtaining initial experience, we promoted it comprehensively.

    II. During the work, the attitude of the registration personnel in receiving the masses must be amiable and patient. Although the masses have prepared for each item, they are afraid of making mistakes and looking bad in crowded places at the station, so when they stand in front of the registration table, some people feel a little nervous. If the registration personnel can ask questions slowly and kindly from beginning to end, it will gradually calm their mood and allow them to answer one by one smoothly. If the registration personnel's attitude is slightly cold or impatient, their unnatural mood will be aggravated, leading to wrong answers. However, due to the intensity of the work, registration personnel work from the beginning to the end, asking this and that, and it is easy to generate irritability. Therefore, registration personnel must be repeatedly educated to be amiable and patient. As some comrades said, "Whether the masses come and go happily has become a sign of how well we are doing our work."

    III. In addition to the above, we must also pay attention to finding tricks and researching a set of methods technically. According to the experience of each electoral district, the following points should be noted in terms of questioning and filling out forms: (1) The questioning should be in order, preferably starting with the house number, then asking about the population that is away, third asking the householder, fourth asking the permanent population, and then asking the name, gender, age, ethnicity, etc. in turn. Ask about the population that is away first and then the householder, because many householders in the city are away, so the householder needs to be changed. If the householder is filled in first, it will be difficult to change; (2) When calculating age, to make it easier for the masses to distinguish and remember, the masses can be told in the publicity: "For those born before June 30th of the Gregorian calendar (May 20th of the lunar calendar), deduct one year according to the imaginary age, and deduct two years for those born after." But some masses have already deducted it during registration, some have deducted it wrong, and some are still using the imaginary age. Therefore, it is necessary to ask clearly about the imaginary age, actual age, and zodiac sign before filling it in; (3) The accents of urban residents vary, so it is not possible to make subjective assumptions, and it is necessary to ask clearly before filling it in. For example, in one electoral district of Xiaowangfu, it was found that five people had their names filled in incorrectly because they were not asked clearly; (4) The writing must be standardized when filling out the form, otherwise it is easy to make mistakes. For example, one electoral district separated the character "six" in "six years old," and the voter certificate was issued as "twenty-eight" years old during voter registration, and the child's mother returned it on the spot; (5) You must be careful and conscientious when writing, otherwise it is also easy to make mistakes. For example, because they are used to writing "19××," it is easy to write "19××" when encountering someone born in 18××, a difference of one hundred years; some also write male as female, and it is not easy to find mistakes; (6) Once the work is completed for a period of time, you should seize the time to check and correct errors in time. Many electoral districts use the time at noon and in the evening to check the day's work, which is of great help in improving the work and correcting errors. A dedicated person should also be designated to control the inspection work to ensure unity.

    Regarding Voter Registration Work

    The purpose of voter registration (including voter qualification review and issuing voter certificates) is to distinguish who has the right to vote and who does not. The key issue is the review of voter qualifications. In this work, the main thing is to draw a clear line between the enemy and us – the line between the masters of the regime and the objects of dictatorship. The main issue in drawing a clear line is actually to clean up the problems left over from past social reform movements. Therefore, the leadership must fully recognize the arduousness and complexity of determining voter qualifications, make full preparations in advance, and mobilize the masses to rely on the masses to do it. Cadres must also have a clear and unified understanding of the policy. Therefore, our basic experience in reviewing voter qualifications is to unify thinking, prepare well, and fully mobilize the masses.

    I. To ensure that cadres have a unified and correct understanding of the policy, they must first be encouraged to study the documents carefully. During this review, some cadres did not study the documents enough, or only had a general conceptual understanding and could not apply it specifically. Therefore, when discussing the issue of changing the class status of a landlord, it had to be repeated up and down several times, affecting the progress of the work. In addition, many electoral districts adopted the method of selecting typical examples by category, and then analyzing and studying them, so that the reviewers could specifically and clearly grasp the policy boundaries, and then return to the masses to publicize and collect materials, which had a very good effect.

    II. Preparing in advance mainly refers to identifying and cleaning up the counter-revolutionaries who have been controlled or have escaped the net and other persons who have been deprived of political rights according to law, in accordance with the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's report on resolving the issues left over from past democratic reform movements. Some necessary procedures, such as changing the class status of landlords, should also be handled as much as possible in advance. Only in this way can we avoid acting hastily at the last minute and making the work passive. In this regard, because we did not do enough in advance, it delayed the entire work process. This is a lesson.

    III. To fully mobilize the masses to do the election work, we must follow the mass line in the work. Before registration, the voter qualification review groups in each electoral district should be produced through popular election and work under the leadership of the election committee. Because a careful and responsible distinction of who has and who does not have the right to vote must be made for many people, it is difficult to do without a review group that is directly elected by the people of each street, closely connected with the masses. Because the voter qualification review group has a major mission, the masses attach great importance to the selection and activities of the reviewers. Therefore, the reviewers must have a clear history, be fair, enthusiastic about their work, connected with the masses, and understand the situation, and these conditions should be proposed to the people for deliberation in the publicity. After the review group is produced, it should be educated to understand and master the policy. At the same time, democratic principles should be seriously implemented in the way it is produced and in its subsequent activities. Only in this way can the elected personnel feel that the people have given him supreme trust, which is a great honor, and actively rely on the masses to participate in the work. Facts have proven that the reviewers produced in this way can generally be closely connected with the masses and have a high degree of enthusiasm for work. Some even forget to eat in order to work. The masses can also actively assist them and report situations to them. For example, the materials of landlord elements who fled to the city are mostly clarified by them.

    Finally, the following matters should also be noted in the voter registration work:

    (1) For those who are initially determined to be without the right to vote, they should be encouraged to register at the station in person as much as possible to prevent omissions and facilitate review; (2) The review group should prepare a notebook during registration to record the problems in the review for correct handling; (3) If the person being reviewed is not satisfied, he can be asked to wait for the final resolution to avoid disputes on the spot and affect the progress of the work; (4) Voter registration personnel should also pay attention to checking whether there are errors in the population survey registration to prevent copying; (5) The handwriting should be correct and kept clean when filling out and issuing voter certificates, because the masses cherish this certificate very much. If it is not written well, it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses; (6) Those who issue voter certificates must strictly keep the voter certificates, and keep accounts of how many are used and how many are left, and also keep the damaged ones for unified burning.

    济南市第二区普选重点试办工作是怎样进行人口调查和选民登记的
    中央政法机关济南市建政工作组
    济南市第二区普选重点试办工作，第一批共十八个选区，已于四月底到五月初作完了人口调查和选民登记（包括审查选民资格，发选民证）工作。
    这两项工作是在普遍进行宣传和大体上弄清了居民情况的基础上，以选区为单位设立登记站结合在一起进行的。为了便利群众，登记站还根据居民居住情况，选择两三个点，采取了巡回登记的办法。进行的步骤大体可分为三步：一、深入动员群众作好准备，并按各街道院户分布情况制定院户一览表；二、分批分片组织和带领群众到站登记。登记完毕即以人口调查登记表对照院户一览表查核有无漏户之误，对照派出所之户口活签查核有无姓名项目之误，对照选民登记表查核有无选民人数之误；三、全面复查，由技术干部、居民委员等分成若干小组，分别到户，以人口调查登记表对照户口簿、选民登记表，对选民证一一仔细查对。工作到此即基本告成。
    关于人口调查工作
    一、必须作好充分的准备工作。人口调查登记工作的要求是不遗漏、不重复、正确无误，同时必须便利群众，尽量少耽误群众的时间，不误生产。它的特点是出一点错就要影响全盘。因此，在领导方面就必须十分重视，在事前认真训练好干部，使他们都充分地认识这件工作的政治意义，工作任务与要求，以克服自满麻痹和责任心不强的思想作风。一般说来，登记人员起初在不同程度上都认为这项工作“没有什么”，特别是搞过户籍的同志，更认为“户籍比这繁杂都能搞，这么几项表还有啥”；也有些同志则认为“反正领导上不能挨个检查”，态度极不严肃；还有一些同志则在这个生疏的工作上提出竞赛，盲目求快。事实证明，这些思想作风都是极其有害的，错误往往由此产生，而为了查核纠正错误必然要付出更多的时间和更大的力量。其次，对群众也必须进行普遍而深入的宣传，使人口调查登记的意义、内容和方法成为家喻户晓的东西。宣传工作作好了，群众就可以解除一切顾虑，自觉地前来登记。如小王府选区在普遍进行了宣传后，又通过居民小组座谈，根据群众领会程度和准备情况作进一步的宣传动员，并交流准备情况。群众绝大部分都作了准备。到登记时，户主普遍记下了全家人口的出生日期，有的一户人数较多不易记忆的，还准备了“登记草单”，无名字的妇女有些也自己起了名字，还有六十一个人自觉地纠正了过去的假年岁。但有的选区由于宣传动员不够，结果登记后还发现不少人过去的假年岁没有得到纠正。因此，要作好人口调查登记这一科学工作，干部和群众必须都有充分的思想准备和技术上的准备。
    为了便利群众，并使工作能够有秩序地顺利地进行，在组织工作上也应作好充分的准备。这方面的工作很多，主要的应该是：除分组分片依次组织群众到站登记外，登记站最好设一等候处，并配备一个熟习业务的宣传员。群众来时一般都很高兴，但由于摸不着头绪，对这一工作的疑问还是很多。此时宣传员即应好好接待他们，给他们排好顺序，找好坐处，并介绍登记站的情况；然后藉他们等候的时候，扼要说明选举意义、登记中应注意的事项和注意保存选民证等问题，并可结合解答群众不明白的问题，检查一下群众准备的情况。因此，宣传员的训练工作应事先作好。凡这样做了的，既便利了工作的进行，群众反映也很好。
    由于我们在这方面还没有经验，而工作又要求不能有一点错误，因此，除启发登记人员认真学习文件外，先选择了一个选区进行试验，取得初步经验后再全面推行。
    二、在进行工作中，登记人员接待群众的态度必须和蔼和耐心。群众虽然每一项都作了准备，但就怕到站上人多的地方说错了不好看，因此到登记桌前一站，有的人心里就有些紧张。登记人员此时如能和气地从头到尾慢慢地发问，就会使他们的心情逐渐安定而顺利地一一答复。如果登记人员态度稍有一点冷淡或带急躁情绪，他们不自然的心情就会加重以致答错问题。但登记人员由于工作紧张，上了班就顶到底，问了这个问那个，很容易产生烦躁情绪。因此就必须再三教育登记人员要和蔼、耐心。正如有的同志说：“能否使群众愉快地来愉快地去，就成了衡量我们工作好坏的标志。”
    三、除以上所述外，还必须注意找窍门，在技术上研究出一套办法来。根据各个选区的体验，在问话和填表方面，应注意下列几点：（一）问话要有次序，最好先问门牌，再问外出人口，三问户主，四问常住人口，再依次问姓名、性别、年龄、民族等。先问外出人口再问户主，是因为城市里户主外出的很多，因而要改户主，如先填了户主就不好改了；（二）计算年龄时，为了便于群众分清和记忆，可在宣传中告诉群众：“凡公历六月三十日（旧历五月二十日）以前出生的，按虚岁扣除一岁，以后生的扣除两岁”，但群众在登记时有的就已扣除，有的还扣除错了，有的仍是虚岁。因此就须问明虚岁实岁和属象后再填；（三）城市住民口音不一，因此不能主观推断，必须问得清清楚楚再填。如小王府一个选区检查出因问得不清楚填错名字的就有五人；（四）填表时写字必须正规，不然也容易出错误，如有一个选区将六岁的六字写分了家，选民登记时看成“二八”岁而发给了选民证，结果孩子的母亲当场退回来；（五）落笔时必须仔细认真，否则也易写错，如因写熟了“一九××年”，在遇到一八××年出生的人就容易写成“一九××年”，一差就是一百岁；也有的把男的写成女的，写错了还不容易发现；（六）工作告一段落，即应抓紧检查，及时纠正差错，不少的选区利用中午和晚上的时间，检查一下当日工作，对于改进工作，纠正差错有很大帮助。检查工作时并应指定专人掌握，以求统一。
    关于选民登记工作
    选民登记（包括选民资格审查、发选民证）的目的，就在区分谁有选举权和谁没有选举权。而其中的关键问题则是审查选民资格。在这工作中，主要的就是划清敌我界限——政权主人和专政对象的界限。划清界限的主要问题，实际就是清理过去历次社会改革运动所遗留下来的问题。因此，领导方面必须充分认识确定选民资格这一工作的艰巨性和复杂性，事先作充分准备，并发动群众依靠群众来作。而干部对政策也须有明确统一的理解。因此，我们对审查选民资格的基本经验是统一思想，做好准备，充分发动群众。
    一、为了使干部对政策有统一正确的理解，首先必须启发他们认真地学习文件。此次审查中，有的干部由于对文件学习不够，或是只有一般概念的理解而不能具体运用，因此，在讨论一个地主改变成份问题时，要上下反复若干次，影响工作的进展。此外也有不少的选区采取分类选出典型，再加以分析研究，从而使审查人员能够具体明确地掌握政策界限，并进一步回到群众中去作宣传和搜集材料的办法，其效果就很好。
    二、事先做好准备工作，主要是指根据邓小平副总理报告中所提到的关于解决历次民主改革运动中的遗留问题的精神，对于已被管制的和漏网的反革命分子及其他依法被剥夺政治权利的分子，事前加以甄别和清理。有些必要的手续，如地主改变成份等，也要事先尽力办好。只有这样，才不致临时仓促从事，使工作陷于被动。在这一方面，由于我们事前做得还不够充分，曾推迟了整个工作的进程。这是一个教训。
    三、要充分发动群众来做选举工作，必须在工作中走群众路线。在登记前，各选区的选民资格审查小组即应通过民选产生，并在选举委员会的领导下进行工作。因为对很多的人都要进行一次慎重而负责的有无选举权利的辨别，如果没有从各街道人民直接推选产生、密切联系群众的审查小组，是难于作到的。由于选民资格审查小组使命重大，因而群众对于审查人员的挑选及其活动也非常重视，因此，审查人员必须具备历史清楚、为人公正、热心工作、联系群众、了解情况等条件，并将这些条件在宣传中即向人民提出酝酿。审查小组产生后即应通过一定的教育，使其了解和掌握政策。同时，在其产生的方式上及以后的活动中，也应认真贯彻民主的原则。只有这样，当选的人员才能感到人民给了他无上的信任，是莫大的光荣，而积极依靠群众，参与工作。事实证明，这样产生的审查人员一般都能与群众紧密联系，工作积极性也很高。有的为了工作连饭都顾不上吃。群众也能积极协助他们和向他们反映情况，如逃来城市的地主分子的材料，绝大部分都是由他们弄清的。
    最后，在选民登记工作中也应注意下列事项：
    （一）初步确定没有选举权的分子，应尽量着其亲自到站登记，以防止漏登，并便于审查；（二）登记时审查小组应准备记事本，以记载审查中的问题，以便正确处理；（三）被审查者如有不服，可着其等候最后解决，以免当场发生争执，影响工作进行；（四）选民登记人员也要注意核对人口调查登记有无差错，防止照抄；（五）填发选民证时字体要端正，并保持洁净，因为群众非常珍惜此证，如果写得不好就会引起群众不满；（六）发选民证者必须严格保管选民证，用了多少，还剩多少，都要记账，毁坏的也要保全，以便统一焚毁。
