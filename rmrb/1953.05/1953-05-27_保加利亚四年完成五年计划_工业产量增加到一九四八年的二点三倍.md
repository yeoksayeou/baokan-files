Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 26th. A communiqué on the results of the implementation of the First Five-Year National Economic Plan (1949-1953) of the People's Republic of Bulgaria's Council of Ministers' State Planning Commission and the Central Statistical Bureau was released on April 29th. The communiqué points out that the main items in the plan were completed ahead of schedule in 1952.

The industrial output in the Five-Year Plan was completed in three years and ten months. According to the provisions of the Five-Year Plan, the industrial output in the final year of the plan—1953—should be 2.2 times that of 1948, and 3.8 times that of the pre-war year 1939. In fact, in 1952, the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan, industrial output had increased to 2.3 times that of 1948 and more than four times that of 1939, and the output of local industry and cooperative industry was not included in the calculation. In the four years from 1949 to 1952, Bulgaria expanded and built more than 700 industrial enterprises, including many factories such as the Stalin Chemical Factory, Pulp Factory, Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory, as well as large power stations such as Stalin, Chervenkov, Republic, and Dimitrov. In these four years, the production volume of the machine industry was 38.1 percent higher than the quota of the Five-Year Plan. In 1952, the total output of machinery increased by 542 percent compared to 1948. Labor productivity in this area increased by 230 percent. Workers in the machine manufacturing industry manufactured many new types of machines and equipment. In 1952 alone, 130 new types of machines and equipment were manufactured. Now, Bulgaria can manufacture almost all types of agricultural machinery except for tractors and self-propelled combine harvesters. With the development of the machine manufacturing industry, the degree of mechanization in the coal mining and mining industries has also greatly increased. The country's power generation has increased, and the power generation in 1952 was 2.5 times that of 1948. The power generated by the power stations that started construction last year alone is much greater than the total power generation of all power stations in Bulgaria in the past. In terms of the production of consumer goods, the output in 1952 increased by 100 percent compared to 1948 and by 200 percent compared to 1939.

In the four years of completing the First Five-Year Plan, the degree of agricultural collectivization and mechanization in Bulgaria has greatly improved. By the end of 1952, the number of state-owned farms had increased to 107, and their cultivated land area had more than doubled compared to 1948. The number of agricultural production cooperatives reached 2,747, and the land they cultivated accounted for 60.5 percent of the country's cultivated land area. The number of machine tractor stations increased to 140, owning 12,295 tractors and 1,363 combine harvesters. The grain of state-owned farms has been harvested entirely by combines. Due to these measures, the output of grain and industrial crops has greatly increased. In 1952, Bulgaria's total crop output exceeded the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1953. Last year, the yield per unit area of wheat in agricultural production cooperatives was 12.6 percent higher than the average for individual farming.

Due to the rapid development of various sectors of the national economy, the number of industrial workers and staff members increased by more than 333,000 in the four years of the Five-Year Plan. There are no unemployed people in the country. In these four years, the rationing system was abolished, state retail prices were reduced twice, and the average annual real wage of each industrial worker in 1952 increased by 38 percent compared to 1939. The income of working peasants has also increased year by year.

    保加利亚四年完成五年计划
    工业产量增加到一九四八年的二点三倍
    【新华社二十六日讯】索非亚消息：保加利亚人民共和国部长会议的国家计划委员会和中央统计局四月二十九日发表了第一个五年国民经济计划（一九四九—一九五三年）执行结果的公报。公报指出，计划中的主要项目都已提前在一九五二年完成了。
    五年计划中的工业产量在三年零十个月中完成了。按照五年计划的规定，计划的最后一年——一九五三年的工业产量要增为一九四八年的二点二倍，为战前一九三九年的三点八倍。实际上，在一九五二年，即五年计划的第四年，工业产量已增加到一九四八年的二点三倍和一九三九年的四倍多，而地方工业和合作社工业的产量尚未计算在内。在一九四九到一九五二年的四年中，保加利亚扩充和新建了工业企业七百多个，其中包括斯大林化学工厂、纸浆工厂、电气设备制造厂等许多工厂以及斯大林、契尔文科夫、共和国和季米特洛夫等大动力站。在这四年中机器工业的生产量，比五年计划的定额多百分之三十八点一。在一九五二年，机器总产量比一九四八年增加了百分之五百四十二。这方面的劳动生产率提高了百分之二百三十。机器制造业工人制造了许多新型机器和设备。在一九五二年就制造了一百三十种新型机器和设备。现在，保加利亚除了还不能制造拖拉机和自动推进联合机以外，差不多所有类型的农业机器都可以制造了。随着机器制造业的发展，采煤业和采矿业的机械化程度也大大提高了。全国的发电量增加了，一九五二年发电量为一九四八年的二点五倍。单是去年开工的电力站的发电量，就比保加利亚过去所有电力站的总发电量都大得多。在消费品的生产方面，一九五二年的产量比一九四八年增加了一倍，比一九三九年增加了两倍。
    在完成第一个五年计划的四年中，保加利亚农业集体化和机械化的程度有了很大的提高。到一九五二年年底，国营农场的数目增加到了一百零七个，它们的耕地面积比一九四八年增加了一倍多。农业生产合作社的数目达到二千七百四十七个，它们所耕的土地占全国耕地面积的百分之六十点五。机器拖拉机站的数目增加到了一百四十个，它们拥有拖拉机一万二千二百九十五台和联合收割机一千三百六十三台。国营农场的谷物已经全部用联合机收割。由于这些措施，谷类和工业作物的产量大大提高。一九五二年保加利亚作物总产量超过了五年计划为一九五三年所规定的水平。去年农业生产合作社小麦的单位面积产量比个体耕作平均多百分之十二点六。
    由于国民经济各部门的迅速发展，在五年计划的四年内，产业工人和机关工作人员的人数增加了三十三万三千多名。全国已经没有失业的人。在这四年中配给制取消了，国营零售价格减低了两次，每个产业工人的每年平均实际工资，在一九五二年比一九三九年提高了百分之三十八。劳动农民的收入也一年年增加了。
