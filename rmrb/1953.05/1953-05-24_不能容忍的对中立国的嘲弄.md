Intolerable Mockery of Neutral Nations
Hu Jin

The current Korean armistice negotiations are being resumed on the basis of both sides agreeing to hand over all remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral nations for custody and processing. Therefore, the important question is how both sides should arrange for the complete transfer of prisoners of war not directly repatriated after the armistice to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and to ensure that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has genuine power and convenience to complete its glorious mission.

Our proposals on April 26 and May 7 have provided practical and effective specific measures for this arrangement and the authority of the neutral nations (Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission). World public opinion believes that our proposal can solve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation and achieve the Korean armistice. However, the US side's 26-point "counter-proposal" on May 13 is completely the opposite, not only overturning the negotiation basis agreed upon by both sides to hand over all remaining prisoners of war not directly repatriated to neutral nations, but also imposing various restrictions to render the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a mere formality and likely to become an ornament for the US side's forced detention of prisoners of war. This is completely unacceptable and an intolerable mockery of neutral nations.

Everyone understands that our purpose in inviting neutral nations is to contribute their strength in the second step of repatriating prisoners of war. According to the negotiation basis agreed upon by both sides, the neutral nations (Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission) will take over all prisoners of war not directly repatriated after the armistice and carry out the practical work of repatriating prisoners of war, ensuring that these prisoners of war enjoy the rights and humanitarian treatment stipulated in the Geneva Convention. Harrison's letter to us on April 16 expressed agreement to "release prisoners of war not directly repatriated to neutral nations for accommodation in Korea," and that "neutral nations would give the parties concerned the opportunity to determine the attitude of those under their accommodation towards their status." However, the US side's "counter-proposal" tore up its own promise, proposing that "all Korean prisoners of war who decide (?) not to exercise their right to be repatriated during their detention in the detaining country on the date the armistice agreement comes into effect should be released and become civilians." In this way, more than two-thirds of our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated will not be sent to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for takeover, but will be handed over to the Syngman Rhee gang by the US side under the guise of "release." In other words, they will not be able to enjoy the rights that Harrison once agreed they should be given, to "determine" their "attitude towards their status" in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; because Harrison has now swallowed his promise, the prisoners of war that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can take over will therefore be less than one-third, and its scope of authority will in fact be greatly reduced out of thin air.

What is going on here? People understand at a glance that this is the old tune of forced detention of prisoners of war by the US side, who violated the provision of the draft armistice agreement completed by both sides last August that all prisoners of war must be repatriated, and created the so-called refusal of forced repatriation. This is the US side overturning the current negotiation basis agreed upon by both sides to transfer prisoners of war not directly repatriated to neutral nations, and therefore also removing the foundation for both sides to establish the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take over and arrange the repatriation of prisoners of war. This absurd proposal by the US side, like other provisions in the US side's "counter-proposal," is also self-contradictory. For example, "Article 1" of the US side's "counter-proposal" states that the establishment of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is to "ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice."; Article 10 stipulates that "any prisoner of war who decides to exercise his right to be repatriated while under the custody of the Custodial Commission may certify this to a body composed of a representative of each member state of the Custodial Commission." May I ask what reason the US side has to propose in another place in the same "counter-proposal" that the more than two-thirds of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should be "released on the spot," and not allowed to go to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to "decide to exercise his right to be repatriated"? Apart from the US side's attempt to use this unequal treatment of our prisoners of war to divide our side, why does the US side have to forcibly separate the tens of thousands of Korean People's Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated? Isn't this a thorough and complete obstruction of repatriation by force, as the US side claims to oppose? Isn't this the conspiracy of forced detention of prisoners of war that the US side has consistently adhered to in violation of the Geneva Convention?

In a statement issued by the US State Department to defend its "counter-proposal" from the condemnation of world public opinion, it said: "The United Nations Command has sought to narrow the scope of the problem in order to give all prisoners of war the greatest possible security and to facilitate the work of the Custodial Commission." And it said: "The purpose of the United Nations Command's recommendation is to make the plan for the custody of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated practical and fair, while at the same time making the Communist side and the people of the world realize that whether prisoners of war want to return home is entirely up to them." However, the US side's forced detention of more than two-thirds of the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated actually greatly "narrows" the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and deprives these tens of thousands of prisoners of war of the right to "decide for themselves whether they want to return home." This is completely unfair.

Therefore, forced detention of prisoners of war is the essence of the US proposal, and it is the fundamental difference between the current US proposal and our proposal. This policy of forced detention of prisoners of war is not only reflected in those parts of the US side's "counter-proposal" that propose "on-the-spot release" of Korean People's Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, but also runs through the entire US side's "counter-proposal." Because the US side is still trying to realize its long-bankrupt conspiracy of forced detention of prisoners of war, the US side's "counter-proposal" uses various restrictions to weaken the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making it in fact a tool for the US side's forced detention of prisoners of war, so that the remaining less than one-third of our prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated—Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war—are actually transferred from the bloody US prisoner of war camps to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "places for the custody of prisoners of war" surrounded and controlled by the US side by force. Moreover, after they have moved in this way for sixty days, they will still fall into the same tragic fate as those Korean People's Army prisoners of war who have been "released on the spot" by the US side, and will eventually be "released" to the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

Now let's look at the dragnet that the US side's "counter-proposal" has laid out for the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

First of all, the US side's "counter-proposal" places the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in the terror-filled and gloomy "demilitarized zone" actually controlled and threatened by the US military, which is only two kilometers away from the US military on all sides. The "counter-proposal" also openly states: "The place for the custody of prisoners of war is actually under the military control of the detaining party." People remember that the US side had tried its best to oppose our proposal to send the prisoners of war to neutral nations in order to relieve them of the long-term US military control and bloody persecution they had suffered. Now we can more clearly know why the US side wanted to do this. Apart from proving that the US side has ulterior motives and still wants to continue to control and threaten our prisoners of war and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, what other reason is there to put forward this absurd proposal?

Second, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is placed under US military control, does not have sufficient armed forces. Therefore, the US side's "counter-proposal" stipulates that "the Indian representative has the right to request the detaining party to provide the necessary enforcement and security forces." Not only that, the commission also "has the right to request the detaining party to provide a certain number of unarmed personnel to carry out work or provide services within the area under its military control or within the place for the custody of prisoners of war." In this way, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission further falls into the US military encirclement. In comparison, the armed forces provided by India will become decorations. Moreover, the US side's "unarmed personnel" are also filled in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the "place for the custody of prisoners of war," and these people will also make the small number of staff sent by the neutral nations (the other four countries other than India can only send up to ten people) redundant. In this way, may I ask what situation the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is in? How much different is this from the US side's horrifying Geoje Island prisoner of war camp?

Third, after the US side has placed the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in this bad position, it further deprives the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of the power and convenience to arrange the repatriation of prisoners of war. On the one hand, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot provide sufficient freedom and convenience when arranging for the countries concerned to carry out explanatory work to the prisoners of war, because the representatives sent by the party concerned to carry out explanatory work can only send one person for every thousand prisoners of war. Obviously, tens of thousands of prisoners of war who have long been under the control and persecution of the US side and are afraid to return home, now that they are still under the control of the US military, and there are still US side "unarmed personnel" "providing services," and there is still the threat of special agents sent by the US side to the prisoner of war camps to impersonate prisoners of war; therefore, for their explanatory work, if we can only send one representative for every thousand prisoners of war, it is obviously impossible to achieve results. Not only that, on the other hand, according to the provisions of the US side's "counter-proposal," even if some prisoners of war bravely break through the control of the US side and its armed and "unarmed" personnel and special agents impersonating prisoners of war and request to be repatriated home, they must also go through "joint research" by representatives of both sides and representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to "affirm" that he "is not forced to make such a decision." Moreover, even if there are such prisoners of war who are "certified" to be allowed to be repatriated home, they must also be handed over to the US side for "management and escort." This layer-by-layer control guarantees that the US side has every opportunity to make things difficult and forcibly detain prisoners of war. The "preface" of the US side's "counter-proposal" hypocritically says: "The transfer of this custodial work itself should be sufficient to dispel any concerns of prisoners about their right and freedom to return to their own hometowns." And Article 3 proposes that "prisoners of war must be given humane treatment at all times in accordance with the special provisions of the Geneva Convention and the general spirit of the Convention." However, may I ask, under the above circumstances, do these hypocritical words have any value?

Fourth, under the above-mentioned multiple restrictions and controls, it is obviously difficult for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to make and carry out work that conforms to the Geneva Convention and humanitarian principles. But the US side's "counter-proposal" is not satisfied with this, and also stipulates that the decisions of the commission and its affiliated institutions, except for procedural matters, must be unanimously agreed upon. Such a provision is completely unnecessary and unreasonable for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is entrusted by both parties and handles the repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the agreement of both parties. There is no other reason to explain this except for the single-minded purpose of making it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to move an inch and accomplish nothing. Now, the US side has put forward this proposal against our side's advocacy of majority decision, precisely for the purpose of paralyzing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Because if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission accomplishes nothing in the sixty days stipulated by the US side, then the prisoners of war will be "released on the spot" in the US military-controlled area without being handed over to the political conference, and the US side's conspiracy of forced detention of prisoners of war can be completely realized.

Fifth, according to the provisions of the US side's "counter-proposal," all prisoners of war who are still unable to dispel their doubts and dare not request repatriation due to being placed under the multiple obstacles arranged by the US side will be "released" after sixty days, that is, forcibly detained. People know that our side absolutely does not recognize any prisoners of war who refuse to be repatriated. All prisoners of war who have doubts and are afraid to return home, once freed from the control and oppression of the US side, are transferred to the custody of neutral nations, and after our side's explanation, they will not be unwilling to be repatriated. However, because the US side has raised this issue, our side believes that these prisoners of war should be handed over to the political conference for handling. Our proposal is completely reasonable, but the US side opposes it. Now, looking at the above-mentioned dragnet laid out by the US side, the US side's intention is obvious. It turns out that the US side has arranged the final tragic fate for all our prisoners of war who, after being formally transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, cannot be repatriated.

This is the US side's conspiracy to paralyze the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war. In this situation, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is just a "turtle in a jar" and becomes a tool for the US side to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

The Chinese and Korean side will never accept this disguised plan of the US side to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Now, the people of all countries in the world and all those who are willing to achieve the Korean armistice are generally dissatisfied with the US side's plan and are closely watching whether the US side will change its unreasonable attitude after the eight-day recess.

    不能容忍的对中立国的嘲弄
    胡今
    目前的朝鲜停战谈判是在双方同意将不直接遣返的全部其余战俘交中立国看管和处理的基础上恢复进行的。因此，重要的问题，是双方应怎样进行安排，使停战后不直接遣返的战俘全部移交中立国遣返委员会，并使中立国遣返委员会具有真正的权力和便利，以便完成其光荣任务。
    我方在四月二十六日和五月七日先后提出的方案，已对这个安排和中立国（中立国遣返委员会）的职权，提供了实际而有效的具体办法。世界舆论都认为我方方案是可以解决战俘遣返问题，谋得朝鲜停战的。但是，美方在五月十三日提出的二十六点“反建议”，却完全相反，不仅推翻了双方业已同意的将不直接遣返的全部其余战俘交中立国的谈判基础，而且以种种限制使中立国遣返委员会徒具形式并势将成为美方强迫扣留战俘的装饰品。这是完全不能接受的，这是不能容忍的对中立国的嘲弄。
    谁都了解，我们邀请中立国的目的，是要他们在进行遣返战俘的第二步骤中贡献其力量。根据双方已同意的谈判基础，中立国（中立国遣返委员会）将接管所有停战后不直接遣返的战俘，并执行遣返战俘的实际工作，保证这些战俘得以享受日内瓦公约规定的权利和人道待遇。哈利逊在四月十六日给我方的信就曾表示同意把“未被直接遣返的战俘释交中立国在朝鲜收容”，“中立国给予有关各方以机会，来确定在其收容下的人员对于他们的地位的态度”。但是，美方的“反建议”撕毁了他自己的这个诺言，竟提出“在停战协定生效之日，在被拘留国拘留期间决定（？）不使用被遣返权利的全体朝鲜籍战俘都予以释放，使之成为平民。”这样，就将有三分之二以上的不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，不能被送交中立国遣返委员会接管，而由美方以“释放”为名，交给李承晚匪帮。也就是说，他们不可能得到哈利逊曾表示同意应给予他们的权利，在中立国遣返委员会里“确定”他们“对于他们的地位的态度”；因为哈利逊现在吞食了诺言，中立国遣返委员会所能接管的战俘，也就因而不到三分之一，它的职权范围实际上就因而凭空被大大打了一个折扣了。
    这是怎么一回事呢？人们一看就明白，这是自去年八月双方完成停战协定草案规定必须遣返全部战俘以来，美方违反该项规定而制造所谓拒绝强迫遣返一类的强迫扣留战俘的旧调重弹。这是美方推翻目前双方业已同意的将不直接遣返战俘转交中立国的谈判基础，因而也是拔掉了双方关于建立中立国遣返委员会进行接管和安排战俘遣返工作的基础。美方这个悖理的方案，就是和美方“反建议”中的其他规定，也是互相矛盾的。例如，美方“反建议”的
    “第一条”里说：成立中立国遣返委员会就是“为了保证全体战俘在停战后都有机会行使其被遣返的权利。”；第十条又规定：“任何战俘，在由看管委员会看管期间，如果决定使用他的遣返权利，得向由看管委员会每一会员国的一个代表组成的一个机构进行这样的证实”。试问美方有何理由在同一“反建议”中的另一地方却提出要把为数三分之二以上不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员“就地释放”，不让他们到中立国遣返委员会去“决定使用他的遣返权利”呢？除了美方企图用这种对我方战俘的不平等待遇来分化我方之外，美方又何必要硬把不直接遣返的数万朝鲜人民军战俘分割开来呢？这难道不是美方扬言反对的彻头彻尾的武力阻挠遣返吗？这难道不是美方所一贯坚持的违反日内瓦公约的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋吗？
    美国国务院为了辩解它的“反建议”遭受的世界舆论的谴责而发表的声明中，说：“联合国军曾经设法缩小问题的范围，以便给予所有战俘以最大的保障，并使看管委员会的工作顺利进行”。并说：
    “联合国军建议的目的是要使看管不直接遣返战俘的计划切合实际与公平，同时使共方与世界人民认识到战俘是否要回家完全由他们自己决定”。但是，美方强迫扣留三分之二以上不直接遣返的战俘，实际上就是大大地“缩小”了中立国遣返委员会的职权范围，剥夺了这数万战俘“是否要回家完全由他们自己决定”的权利。这是完全不公平的。
    因此，强迫扣留战俘，这就是美方方案的实质，也就是目前美方方案和我方方案根本不同的分歧所在。这种强迫扣留战俘的方针，不仅表现在美方“反建议”提出“就地释放”不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军战俘的那些部分，而且贯穿在整个的美方“反建议”之中。由于美方现在仍图实现其早已破了产的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，于是，美方的“反建议”就用种种限制来削弱中立国遣返委员会的职权，使它实际上成为美方强迫扣留战俘的工具，以便把剩下不到三分之一的不直接遣返的我方战俘——中国人民志愿军被俘人员，实际上是从血腥的美方战俘营转到由美方用武力包围控制的中立国遣返委员会的“看管战俘的处所”。而且，他们在经过这样地迁居了六十天后，将仍旧落到和那些被美方“就地释放”的朝鲜人民军战俘那样的悲惨命运，最后被“释放”交给蒋介石匪帮。
    现在请看美方“反建议”对于中立国遣返委员会的职权范围所布置的天罗地网吧。
    首先，美方“反建议”把中立国遣返委员会安置在恐怖阴森的美军实际控制和威胁下的“非军事区”，该区四周与美军相距只有两公里。“反建议”还公然指明：“战俘看管处所实际上处于拘留一方军事控制之下”。人们记得，美方曾竭力反对我方关于将战俘送到中立国去以便解除他们长期所受到的美方军事控制和血腥迫害的建议。现在我们可以更清楚地知道美方为什么要这样做了。这除了证明美方别有用心，仍要继续对我方战俘以及中立国遣返委员会施行控制和威胁以外，还有什么理由提出这个荒谬的建议呢。
    第二、被安置在美方军事控制下的中立国遣返委员会又是没有足够的武装力量的。因此，美方“反建议”就规定“印度代表有权要求拘留一方供给必要的执行和保安部队”。不仅这样，委员会还“有权要求拘留一方提供一定的非武装人员以进行工作，或在其军事管制下的地区内看管战俘的处所之内提供服务。”这样，中立国遣返委员会就进一步地落到了美国的军事包围之中。在这相形之下，印度提供的武装部队将成了点缀品。而且，美方的“非武装人员”还充斥在中立国遣返委员会和“看管战俘的处所”，这些人也将使中立国派出的为数很少的工作人员
    （印度以外的其他四国至多只能派十名）成了多余的了。这样一来，试问中立国遣返委员会是处在什么境遇呢？这和目前美方令人听了就要毛骨悚然的巨济岛战俘营之类的场所，能有多大的不同呢？
    第三、美方“反建议”给中立国遣返委员会安置了这个恶劣地位之后，还进一步剥夺中立国遣返委员会安排战俘遣返工作的权力和便利。一方面，中立国遣返委员会在安排所属国家向战俘进行解释工作时，不可能提供充分的自由和便利，因为有关一方所派出进行解释工作的代表，在每一千名战俘中只能派一人。显然地，数万长期在美方控制和迫害下心存疑惧、不敢回家的战俘，现在既仍旧处在美军控制之下，又还有美方“非武装人员”在“提供服务”，还有美方一直就派遣到战俘营去冒充战俘的特务分子的威胁；因此，对于他们的解释工作，如果每一千名战俘我方只能派一个代表，显然是不可能收到效果的。不仅这样，另一方面，根据美方“反建议”的规定，即使有些战俘勇敢地冲破美方及其所派武装与“非武装”人员和冒充战俘的特务分子的控制，要求遣返回家时，又还须经过双方代表和中立国遣返委员会代表的“共同研究”，以“肯定”他“不是被迫作出这样的决定的”。而且，即使有这样的战俘，他被“证实”允许遣返回家时，也还需交给美方来“管理和护送”，这种层层控制就保证了美方有留难和强迫扣留战俘的一切机会。美方“反建议”的“绪言”假惺惺地说：“这种看管工作的转移的本身当足以打消俘虏关于他们回到自己家乡去的权利和自由的任何顾虑”。又第三条提出“必须经常按照日内瓦公约的特别规定以及公约总的精神，给予战俘人道的待遇”。但是，试问在上述情况下，这些虚伪言词还有半点价值吗？
    第四、在上述重重限制与控制下，中立国遣返委员会显然是很难决定和进行符合于日内瓦公约和人道原则的工作的。但美方的“反建议”还不以此为满足，还规定委员会及其附属机构的决定，除程序事项外，须经一致同意。这样的规定，对于接受双方委托并根据双方协议来处理遣返战俘工作的中立国遣返委员会来说，是完全不必要的，而且是没有道理的。这除了一心要使中立国遣返委员会寸步难行、一事无成以外，是再没有别的理由可以解释的。现在，美方提出这个建议，反对我方以多数决定的主张，正不是为了别的，而是为了使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪。因为如果中立国遣返委员会在美方规定的六十天工作中一事无成，那末，战俘就要在美方的军事控制地区内被“就地释放”，而不交给政治会议，美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋这样就可以完全如愿以偿了。
    第五、依照美方“反建议”的规定，所有由于处在美方所布置的重重障碍下仍旧无法解除疑惧，不敢要求遣返的战俘，经过六十天后就要被“释放”亦即强迫扣留了。人们知道，我方绝对不承认有什么拒绝遣返的战俘，所有心存疑惧、不敢回家的战俘，一旦解脱了美方的控制和压迫，转交中立国看管，并经我方解释后，是不会不愿遣返的，但由于美方提出这一问题，所以我方认为这些战俘应交政治会议处理。我方这个建议是完全合理的，但美方反对。现在，摆在上述美方布下的天罗地网中来看，美方的居心就昭然若揭了。原来，美方是替所有形式地转移到中立国遣返委员会后不可能得到遣返的我方战俘们，安排了最后的悲惨命运的。
    这就是美方为了强迫扣留战俘而使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪的阴谋。在这种情形下，中立国遣返委员会只是“瓮中之鳖”，成为美方强迫扣留战俘的工具而已。
    中朝方面决不接受美方这个伪装的强迫扣留战俘的方案。现在，世界各国人民和所有愿意实现朝鲜停战的人士，都对美方方案普遍地表示不满，并密切地注视着美方在休会八天后是否改变其无理态度。
