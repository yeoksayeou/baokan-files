The Guangde County Cooperative Federation in Anhui Province writes: In our chemical fertilizer supply work during last winter and this spring, we had serious bureaucracy, resulting in lower-level cooperatives resorting to commandism, arbitrary allocation, and sales on credit, which harmed the interests of the masses and the prestige of the People's Government (the original criticism letter was published in this newspaper on May 5th). What is even more serious is that this problem existed for a long time, and individual section chiefs in the county cooperative knew about it, but the leaders of the county cooperative were still unaware. When the county party committee discovered the issue and pointed it out to the county cooperative, the leadership of the county cooperative still did not conduct timely in-depth inspection and correction of the aforementioned deviations. It was not until the masses widely raised opinions, the party committee criticized, and the higher-level authorities investigated responsibility that our cooperative, together with the county government's production office, organized forces to go to the countryside for inspection. We are now informing you of the inspection results and our self-criticism.

In 1952, our cooperative focused on supplying chemical fertilizers. When drafting the supply plans for the fourth quarter of 1952 and 1953, we did not properly investigate the actual needs of the farmers, and blindly pursued figures. When assigning tasks to grassroots cooperatives, we did not provide specific methods, and one-sidedly emphasized "completing the task" and rewarding those who sold more. Many grassroots cooperatives, after accepting the tasks, adopted methods of forced allocation and sales on credit: some allocated according to the area of farmland, some allocated according to households, some allocated according to population, and some were even allocated by rural cadres, with the surplus allocated to landlords. The above erroneous practices caused great harm: some farmers did not understand how to use chemical fertilizers and killed their crops; some farmers did not want them and discarded them after being allocated, or left them at home unused. The farmers had many complaints, and the cooperative also had its capital tied up due to the large amount of fertilizer sold on credit. In order to reverse the adverse effects caused by the above errors and eliminate farmers' concerns about using chemical fertilizers, the county party committee has, in conjunction with relevant departments, organized farmer representatives to visit farms to observe the actual experimental rice paddies' effect of applying chemical fertilizers to rice seedlings after transplanting, and explained the effectiveness and usage methods of chemical fertilizers based on local experience. We also plan to conduct another experiment on using chemical fertilizers as rice paddy fertilizer after transplanting. Our cooperative has also decided to organize cooperative staff involved in supplying chemical fertilizers for learning, so that every cadre understands the effectiveness and usage methods of chemical fertilizers, in order to conduct propaganda to farmers and gradually promote them in the future based on the actual local conditions. Regarding the fertilizers that have already been allocated and sold on credit, the county production office has decided that: for those who are willing to purchase, the sales on credit will be changed to cash sales in conjunction with bank fertilizer loans or recovering fertilizer payments in conjunction with the purchase of local specialties; if the allocated fertilizer is unwanted, it can be recovered by the cooperative.

### 广德县合作总社来信检讨供应肥料工作中的官僚主义

    广德县合作总社来信检讨供应肥料工作中的官僚主义
    安徽省广德县合作总社来信：我们在去冬今春供应化学肥料工作中有着严重的官僚主义，以致造成下级社强迫命令、任意摊派、赊销的情况，损害了群众利益和人民政府的威信（原批评信刊五月五日本报）。而更严重的是：这一问题发生很久，县社有个别股长早已知道，而县社领导同志仍不知道；当县委发觉后向县社指出，县社领导方面仍然没有及时深入检查和纠正上述偏向；直至群众普遍提意见、党委指责、上级追查责任时，我社才会同县府生产办公室组织力量下乡检查。现将检查结果和我们的检讨告诉你们。
    我社一九五二年重点供应化学肥料，在编制一九五二年第四季度和一九五三年供肥计划时，我社没有很好调查农民实际需要，就盲目追求数字；而向基层社布置工作时，也没有交代具体办法，片面强调“完成任务”和多销者得奖。不少基层社在接受任务后，就采取了强迫摊派和赊销的办法：有的按田亩分配，有的按户分配，有的按人口分配，甚至有的由农村干部分摊，多余的分配给地主。以上错误做法造成很大的恶果：有的农民不懂化学肥料的用法，把庄稼浇死了，有的农民不愿要，派得后就丢了或放在家里不用。农民们意见极多，而合作社也因大量肥料赊出，积压了资金。为了挽回上述错误所造成的不良影响，消除农民对使用化学肥料的顾虑，县委已会同有关部门组织农民代表到农场观摩实际试验秧田施用化学肥料接秧的效果，结合当地的经验说明化学肥料的效能和使用方法；并准备在栽秧后再进行一次用化学肥料做稻田肥料的试验。我社也决定组织合作社供应化学肥料工作人员进行学习，使每一个干部都了解化学肥料的效能和使用方法，以便今后根据当地实际情况，向农民进行宣传，逐步推广。对于已摊派及赊销出的肥料，县生产办公室已决定：凡愿购买者，即结合银行肥料贷款变赊销为现销或结合收购土特产品收回肥料款；如被派肥料而不愿要者，可以由合作社收回。
