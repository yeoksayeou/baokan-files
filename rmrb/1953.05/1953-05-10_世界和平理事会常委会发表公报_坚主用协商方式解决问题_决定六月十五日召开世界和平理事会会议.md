Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, May 7th (Tass): The World Peace Council Standing Committee issued a communiqué regarding the situation of the Standing Committee's Stockholm meeting.

The communiqué stated: The World Peace Council Standing Committee held a meeting in Stockholm on May 5th and 6th, 1953.

The International Committee of the World People's Peace Congress has submitted to the governments of the five major powers the letter from the World People's Peace Congress requesting the five major powers to conduct consultations to conclude a peace treaty.

The Standing Committee welcomes this action. The Standing Committee is particularly pleased that this action has received a wide response worldwide. The Standing Committee calls on people from all walks of life in all countries to support this request. The Standing Committee reiterates that resolving problems through consultation must prevail over resolving problems through force.

The Standing Committee believes that the clear truths propagated by the peace movement for several years and the wise causes supported by the peace movement have begun to bear fruit. New circumstances have formed, requiring us to redouble our efforts.

Due to recent events, the proposition of consultation has gained the support of millions more people. These events tell the people of all countries that they can use their actions to ease international tensions, and that the easing of international tensions is beneficial to everyone and is a source of prosperity.

In Korea, negotiations have resumed. The people of all countries should demand that these negotiations reach a ceasefire agreement in the near future, resolving this conflict that has caused so much suffering and threatens to expand to the entire world.

To maintain peace, it is also necessary for the four major powers to hold negotiations on the German question in order to achieve a peaceful resolution to the problem.

Currently, there are still certain forces directly or indirectly preventing the easing of international tensions. However, the common sense and vigilance of peace-loving people can defeat these forces. Peace-loving people will oppose all actions and conspiracies that may delay or undermine consultations. They demand that governments make every effort to start and successfully conclude consultations.

In order to find new ways to promote consultations, and to attract those who, under the influence of recent events, have begun to realize the necessity and possibility of consultation to participate in actions to defend peace, the Standing Committee decided to convene a meeting of the World Peace Council in Budapest on June 15th, 1953.

In view of recent international events, the meeting will pay particular attention to the necessary efforts to ensure that resolutions reached through consultation prevail in all circumstances. The work of the meeting will contribute to easing international tensions and will help to ensure the security of the people of all countries and respect for the independence of the people of all countries.

    世界和平理事会常委会发表公报
    坚主用协商方式解决问题
    决定六月十五日召开世界和平理事会会议
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩七日讯：世界和平理事会常务委员会发表关于常务委员会斯德哥尔摩会议情况的公报。
    公报说：世界和平理事会常务委员会于一九五三年五月五日和六日在斯德哥尔摩举行会议。
    世界人民和平大会国际委员会已把世界人民和平大会要求五大国进行协商以缔结和平公约的致五大国政府书送交各国政府。
    常务委员会对这一行动表示欢迎。常务委员会特别满意的是：这一行动已经在全世界得到广泛的反应。常务委员会呼吁各国各阶层人士支持这一要求。常务委员会再度肯定地说，用协商方式来解决问题必须胜过用武力来解决问题。
    常务委员会认为：和平运动几年以来所宣传的明白的真理和和平运动所支持的明智的事业已开始出现成果。新的情况已经形成，需要我们加倍努力。
    由于最近的事件，协商的主张又另外获得千百万人的拥护。这些事件告诉各国人民，他们可以用自己的行动使国际紧张局势缓和下来，而国际局势的缓和对大家都有好处，这是繁荣的泉源。
    在朝鲜，谈判恢复了。各国人民应该要求这个谈判在最近达成停战协定，解决这个造成如此多的苦难并且有扩大到全世界之势的冲突。
    要维护和平，还需要四大国就德国问题举行谈判，以求得问题的和平解决。
    现在，还有某些势力直接或间接地阻止国际紧张局势的缓和。不过，爱好和平的人们的常识和警惕性是能够使这种势力失败的。爱好和平的人们将反对可能拖延或破坏协商的一切行动和阴谋。他们要求各国政府竭力使协商开始并胜利结束。
    为了找出促成协商的新途径，为了吸引那些在最近事件的影响下开始认识到必须进行协商和有可能进行协商的人们参加保卫和平的行动，常务委员会决定于一九五三年六月十五日在布达佩斯召开世界和平理事会会议。
    鉴于最近的国际事件，会议将特别注意必须努力使得用协商方式获致的决议在任何情况下都取得胜利。会议的工作将对缓和国际紧张局势有所贡献，将有助于保障各国人民的安全和对各国人民独立的尊重。
