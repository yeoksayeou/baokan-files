　　Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th: TASS reports that on May 25th, Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, wrote to Passant, Secretary-General of the Four Power Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference on the Austrian Treaty. The letter pointed out that despite the efforts of the Soviet side, the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference on the Austrian Treaty had not produced the desired results, and that under the current circumstances, it would be more appropriate to study the issue through diplomatic exchanges of views. The letter also pointed out that the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference on the Austrian Treaty is not a permanent four-power body, and the power to convene this conference lies with the Council of Foreign Ministers.
　　In a reply to Malik on May 26th, on behalf of the representatives of France, Britain, and the United States, Passant attempted to question the fact that the power to convene the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference lies with the Council of Foreign Ministers, and attempted to prove that such a conference could not, as allegedly, lead to the conclusion of an Austrian treaty, but he could not provide evidence to support his claim.
　　Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, sent the following letter to Passant on May 28th:
　　Your letter of May 26th has been received.
　　My letter of May 25th has already clarified the Soviet side's attitude on the issues raised in your letter. I pointed out in this letter that the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference on the Austrian Treaty is not a permanent four-power body, and the power to convene this conference lies with the Council of Foreign Ministers. The Council of Foreign Ministers has not issued instructions to convene the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference. Therefore, your statement in the letter that drafting the Austrian treaty is the task of the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference is unfounded.
　　It is known that the Austrian treaty issue has been repeatedly discussed at the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference, including a meeting in February of this year, without producing the desired results, and the responsibility for the failure of the aforementioned meetings absolutely does not lie with the Soviet side.
　　All this proves that, at present, it would be more appropriate to study this issue through diplomatic exchanges of views.

    苏联驻英大使再度致函帕桑特
    说明对召开对奥和约外长助理会议的态度
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十九日讯：五月二十五日，苏联驻英国大使马立克致函对奥和约四国外长助理会议秘书长帕桑特，信中指出：尽管有苏联方面的努力，但在对奥和约问题上，外长助理会议并没有产生应有的结果，而且在目前情况之下，通过外交途径相互交换意见来研究这个问题，将会比较得当。信中并指出，对奥和约外长助理会议不是一个常设的四国机构，这个会议的召集权在外长会议。
    帕桑特以法、英、美三国代表的名义在五月二十六日给马立克的复信中，企图对外长助理会议的召集权在外长会议这一事实提出疑问，并企图证明这样的会议不能像据说的那样会导向缔结对奥和约，然而他却不能提出证据来支持他的说法。
    苏联驻英国大使马立克在五月二十八日把下列信件送给帕桑特：
    你的五月二十六日的来信已经收到。
    在我的五月二十五日的信中，已就你的来信中所提出的问题阐明了苏联方面的态度。我在这封信中首先指出，对奥和约外长助理会议不是一个常设的四国机构，这个会议的召集权在外长会议。外长会议并没有就召集外长助理会议发出指示。所以，你来信中所说草拟对奥和约是外长助理会议的任务一节，是没有根据的。
    大家知道，在外长助理会议上一再讨论对奥和约问题，包括本年二月的一次会议在内，并没有产生应有的结果，而上述历次会议失败的责任绝对不在苏联方面。
    这一切证明：在目前，通过外交途径相互交换意见来研究这个问题，将会比较得当。
