    [Our Newspaper] Since the state-owned machine manufacturing factories in the Northeast region began mobilizing employees to discuss production plans in early February this year, they have achieved considerable success and gained experience.
    By early April, most state-owned machine manufacturing factories in the Northeast had discussed and formulated production plans. According to preliminary statistics, except for Electric Engineering Factory No. 4 and Machinery Factory No. 11, the production plans of other factories generally exceeded the original state plan by more than 20% after discussions with employees, with individual factories even exceeding it by 60%. These factories are currently formulating technical organization measures plans and preparing to sign collective contracts. Some state-owned factories and most local state-owned factories have not paid enough attention to the discussion of plans by the factory leadership, and some have only begun to mobilize employees now, while others have not yet mobilized them.
    The machine manufacturing factories in the Northeast have gained the following experiences in the process of discussing the state plan:
    Before mobilizing employees to discuss the plan, the factory leaders must first analyze and study the various production conditions of the enterprise and identify the key and potential areas of production. This is an important preparatory work. Machinery Factories No. 6, 14, 15, and 18, etc., carefully analyzed the factory's past equipment utilization rate, process arrangement, tool and fixture, raw material supply, labor organization, technical capabilities allocation, and operating methods before mobilizing employees to discuss the plan. They figured out the development laws and key problems in production of their factories over the past few years and put forward the targets for exceeding production this year with a developing perspective. This analysis not only broke the conservative thinking of the leading cadres but also pointed out the direction of struggle for the employees. The director of Machinery Factory No. 10 initially believed the head of the planning section and refused to raise the plan; later, when he analyzed the factory's potential, he believed that the original plan was conservative and formulated a plan that was 24.6% higher than the original plan. Wang Hongwen, director of Machinery Factory No. 1, also insisted on backward targets, but when Wang Wenshan, director of the second workshop of the factory, presented him with conclusive data that could improve the plan, he was convinced. Machinery Factory No. 11, due to not doing a good job in preparation, lacked confidence in discussing the plan from cadres to workers, and only emphasized objective difficulties such as insufficient equipment, untimely supply of large castings, and insufficient tools and fixtures, and did not start from subjective efforts, so the discussion of the plan has been delayed until April 10th without unfolding.
    Secondly, when mobilizing employees to discuss the plan, it is necessary to organize and lead the personnel of the sections and offices to go to the workshops. Machinery Factory No. 6, Rolling Stock Factory, and Machinery Factory No. 15 have explored some experiences in organizing section and office personnel to go to the workshops in this discussion of the plan. Before organizing section and office personnel to go to the workshops, the leading cadres first analyzed the key points within the factory, distinguished the types, and then organized them to solve different key problems according to the different expertise of the section and office personnel. Then, they organized section and office personnel and workers to hold forums and meetings to explain the importance of section and office personnel going to the workshops and to explain to section and office personnel that the main responsibilities of going to the workshops are to help employees solve key problems, induce employees to find tricks, identify and deal with tricks, and listen to workers' opinions to improve section and office work. As a result, the section and office personnel in these factories not only helped the employees find tricks and improved the work of the sections and offices, but also strengthened the relationship between the section and office personnel and the workers. The section and office personnel of Machinery Factory No. 6 are currently formulating measures plans to improve the work of the sections and offices based on more than 480 suggestions made by workers to improve the work of the sections and offices. Rolling Stock Factory and Factory No. 15 also received good results in organizing section and office personnel to work in the workshops. However, some factories did not attach importance to this work in this discussion of the plan. Cadres of Machinery Factory No. 3 believed that "section and office work is already very busy," so they did not organize them to go to the workshop. Machinery Factory No. 1, although it organized some personnel to go down, did not explain their responsibilities clearly, and the section and office personnel did not know what to do after going down, so the effect was not great.
    Again, after the employees are mobilized, it is necessary to guide the employees to grasp the key problems in production to find tricks, and the tricks proposed by the employees must be dealt with in a timely manner, measures plans must be formulated, and operating procedures must be revised. Machinery Factory No. 11, because it can lead workers and technicians to grasp and solve the four key problems in production, the discussed plan is 60% higher than the state plan and about 20% higher than the factory's planned targets. The annual plan of the Rolling Stock Factory can be completed one and a half months ahead of schedule this year. Machinery Factories No. 10 and 14 have basically changed the state of backlog of tricks. In these factories, whenever employees propose tricks, they can quickly register, review, and deal with them; the tricks that can be solved in the workshop are solved in the workshop, and those that cannot be solved in the workshop are submitted to the factory's rationalization proposal committee for resolution; all tricks that are adopted have special personnel responsible for handling them and formulating adoption dates and measures plans; in order to quickly deal with tricks, they are also responsible for giving strong support to each section and office in design and raw material supply. Machinery Factory No. 15 also adopts the method of handling tricks layer by layer from the bottom up, which is also very effective. Of the 683 tricks proposed by the Ma Hengchang workshop (including 73 large tricks that require design), only one trick was reported to the factory for resolution, and the others were successfully resolved in the workshop.
    In addition, to ensure the completion of advanced plans, it is necessary to formulate comprehensive measures plans. Machinery Factory No. 15, while formulating the state production plan, also formulated measures plans to train workers. Each group decided to adopt methods such as master-apprentice contracts, technical research associations, and running spare-time technical schools to improve the technical level of low-level workers and train formal workers from apprentices this year. This creates conditions for the realization of the plan.
    In this discussion of the plan, most factories still have many shortcomings, mainly manifested in: First, many factories still have a one-sided view of emphasizing quantity over quality in the discussion of the plan. Machinery Factories No. 7, 11, 12, 15, and 25, etc., often produced defective products in the past, sometimes reaching more than 15%, but in this discussion of the plan, they did not mobilize employees to discuss how to ensure quality, so defective products continue to be produced. Second, the problem of new product trial production was not well studied. Many factories emphasized that discussing new product trial production is difficult and did not hand over the drawings of new products, the designed tools and fixtures, the formulated operating procedures, and construction procedures to employees for discussion. Machinery Factory No. 17, because it did not study the trial production of new products well, affected the completion of the production task in the first quarter. Third, while discussing the plan, they did not pay attention to completing the production task and ignored the work of promoting advanced experience. Because the discussion of the plan was not combined with improving planning management, Machinery Factories No. 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 19, Electric Engineering Factories No. 3, 4, and 15, etc., did not complete the task in the first quarter. Some factories, although they completed the task, were loose at the beginning of the quarter and tight at the end of the quarter, and production was not balanced. Some factories only asked workers to find tricks when discussing the plan and did not mention promoting advanced experience. Some factories replaced advanced experience with tricks. Fourth, the group plans are not realistic, and the leadership of the groups is relaxed. In Machinery Factory No. 18, more than 90% of the groups did not realize the plan in March. In the Hardware General Factory, more than 80% of the group plans only have indicators and clauses, without specific measures plans. The main reason is that the leadership of the groups has been relaxed. These shortcomings should be solved in the future review and remedial work of the production plan.

    东北大部国营机器工厂制定生产计划
    提高原定指标五分之一以上
    应该注意加强计划管理，均衡地完成生产任务
    【本报讯】东北地区国营机器制造工厂，自今年二月初开始发动职工群众讨论生产计划以来，已得到了不少的成绩和经验。
    东北大部分国营机器制造工厂，到四月上旬，已讨论和制订了生产计划。据初步统计，除电工四厂、机械十一厂外，其他各厂的生产计划，经过职工讨论后，一般都超过原国家计划的百分之二十以上，个别厂甚至超过了百分之六十。这些厂，目前正在制订技术组织措施计划，和准备签订集体合同。部分国营工厂和大部分地方国营工厂，因工厂的领导干部对讨论计划重视不够，有的直到现在才开始发动职工，有的尚未发动。
    东北机器制造工厂，在讨论国家计划过程中，得到如下经验：
    在发动职工讨论计划以前，工厂的领导人员事先要分析和研究本企业生产上的各种情况，找出生产上的关键和潜力所在。这是一项重要的准备工作。机械六、十四、十五、十八等厂，在发动职工讨论计划前，都细致地分析了厂内过去设备利用率、工序排列、工具卡具及原材料供应、劳动力组织、技术能力配备、操作方法等情况，摸出自己厂几年来发展的规律和生产中的关键问题，用发展的眼光提出今年超产的指标。这样分析后，不仅打破了领导干部的保守思想，也给职工指出了奋斗的方向。机械十厂厂长，开始轻信计划科科长的话，不肯把计划提高；后来当他分析了厂内的潜力，才相信原来的计划是保守的，订出了比原计划提高百分之二十四点六的计划。机械一厂厂长汪洪文，也曾坚持落后指标，但当该厂第二车间主任王文山，拿出可以提高计划的确凿资料摆在他面前时，他才服了气。机械十一厂，因没有做好准备工作，从干部到工人，对讨论计划都无信心，一味强调设备不足、大铸件供应不及时、工具卡具不够用等客观困难，不从主观上着手努力，结果讨论计划一直拖到四月十日还没有展开。
    其次，发动职工讨论计划时，必须要有组织、有领导地组织科、室人员下车间。机械六厂、车辆厂、机械十五厂，在这次讨论计划中，在组织科、室人员下车间时，摸索出了些经验。他们在组织科、室人员下车间前，先由领导干部分析了厂内的关键，区别类型，再依据科、室人员的不同特长，分别组织他们去解决不同的关键问题。接着就组织科、室人员和工人开座谈会、见面会，说明科、室人员下车间的重要意义，并向科、室人员说明，下车间的主要职责，是帮助职工解决关键问题、诱导职工找窍门，鉴定、处理窍门，同时听取工人意见，改进科、室工作。结果，这些厂的科、室人员，不仅帮助职工找了窍门，改进了科、室工作，而且密切了科、室人员和工人的关系。机械六厂科、室人员，目前正根据工人提出的改进科、室工作的四百八十多条建议，制订改进科、室工作的措施计划。车辆厂、十五厂，在组织科、室人员下车间工作上，也收到良好的效果。但是，在这次讨论计划中，也有些厂未重视这项工作。机械三厂干部认为“科、室工作已很忙了”，就未组织他们到车间去。机械一厂，虽组织些人员下去，因未把职责说清楚，科、室人员下去后，不知应干什么，收效不大。
    再次，职工发动起来后，必须引导职工抓住生产上的关键问题去找窍门，而且必须及时处理职工提出的窍门，订出措施计划，修改操作规程。机械十一厂，因为能领导工人、技术人员，抓住解决了生产中的四大关键问题，讨论出来的计划，比国家计划提高了百分之六十，比厂订指标提高了百分之二十左右。车辆厂今年全年计划可提前一个半月完成。机械十、十四厂，已基本上转变了积压窍门状态。这些厂，每当职工提出窍门后，都能很快地加以登记、审查、处理；车间能解决的窍门，皆在车间解决，车间不能解决的，提给厂合理化建议委员会解决；凡被采纳的窍门，都有专人负责处理，订出采用的日期和措施计划；为了迅速处理窍门，还责成各科、室在设计和原料供应上，给予大力支持。机械十五厂，采用了由下而上层层处理窍门的方法，也很有效。马恒昌车间，提出的六百八十三个窍门
    （其中有七十三个需设计的大窍门），只有一个窍门报到厂部解决，其他都在车间完满解决了。
    此外，要保证完成先进的计划，必须要订出全面的措施计划。机械十五厂，在制订国家生产计划同时，还制订了培养工人的措施计划。各个小组，都决定在今年内，采用师徒合同、技术研究会、办业余技术学校等方式提高低级工人的技术水平和从学徒中培养正式工人。这样，就给实现计划创造了条件。
    在这次讨论计划中，大部分工厂还存在不少缺点，主要表现在：一、许多厂在讨论计划中，还存在着重量不重质的片面观点。机械七、十一、十二、十五、二十五等厂，过去常出废品，有时竟达百分之十五以上，但在这次讨论计划中，却未发动职工讨论怎样保证质量，因此目前仍不断出废品。二、没很好研究新产品试制问题。许多厂都强调讨论新产品试制有困难，不把新产品的图纸、设计的工具卡具、制订的操作规程、施工程序交给职工讨论。机械十七厂，就因为未把新产品试制研究好，影响了第一季生产任务的完成。三、在讨论计划的同时，没有注意完成生产任务，忽视推广先进经验的工作。因为没有把讨论计划和改进计划管理结合起来，机械五、八、十一、十三、十四、十八、十九厂，电工三、四、十五等厂，在第一季度都没有完成任务。有些厂虽完成了任务，也是季初松，季末紧，生产不均衡。有些厂讨论计划时，只要工人找窍门，没提推广先进经验。有的把窍门代替了先进经验。四、小组计划不切实际，对小组领导放松。机械十八厂，三月份有百分之九十以上的小组没实现计划。五金总厂，有百分之八十以上的小组计划只有指标和条文，没有具体的措施计划。主要原因是对小组的领导放松了。这些缺点，应该在今后进行生产计划的复查和补课工作中加以解决。
