People Throughout the Country Rally and March to Celebrate May Day
The Broad Masses of Workers Express Their Determination to Strive to Build the Motherland

Throughout our country, people enthusiastically held grand parades and celebrations to celebrate the "May Day" International Labor Day. In addition to major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang, more than three million people in other cities participated in celebratory parades. People in Ulanhot City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also held a parade to celebrate.

华东 (Huadong - East China)

With its long revolutionary tradition, Shanghai's workers and people from all walks of life, numbering over 600,000, held a grand parade on May 1st to celebrate the first "May Day" International Labor Day since the start of large-scale economic construction in our country.

Prior to the parade, a celebration ceremony was held centered around People's Square. Representatives from all walks of life gathered here. Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army in East China and Shanghai, as well as responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations, attended the ceremony. Foreign diplomatic personnel stationed in Shanghai also attended.

The ceremony began with music and gun salutes. Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, called on Shanghai's workers and people from all walks of life to strive to complete the three major tasks of 1953 and to struggle to realize the country's first Five-Year Plan. At about 10:00 am, the parade began. 200,000 people participated in the parade in the city center.

The parade fully demonstrated the Shanghai people's remembrance of the great revolutionary teacher Stalin. A chart from the Xinhua Bookstore indicated that the store had sold more than 78,000 copies of Stalin's works since Stalin's death. Workers' contingents held up many production charts and production models, showing the rapid development of Shanghai's industrial production and the Shanghai workers' major contribution to the motherland. Charts indicated that the production of Shanghai's machine industry increased by 109.8 percent in 1952 compared to 1951. By learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's No. 3 Factory increased the proportion of special-grade and first-grade steel in its total output from 47 percent in the first quarter of last year to 97 percent in the first quarter of this year. The output of cotton yarn in Shanghai's cotton textile industry in the first quarter of this year increased by 89.54 percent compared with the same period last year.

The charts in the parade strongly demonstrated the enormous role of Shanghai workers in supporting the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and supporting the nation's basic construction. The Yimin Food Factory increased its total output value by 384.57 percent from 1950 to 1952. Employees of the Shanghai Railway Bureau and Shanghai medical workers went to Korea in large numbers to support the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the Shanghai Railway Bureau also organized a reserve brigade of 30,000 people to support the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In supporting national basic construction, 11,200 Shanghai construction workers and technicians have gone to various parts of the country. The Shanghai Electric Motor Factory could only manufacture 200-horsepower generators before liberation, but last year it was able to manufacture 2,000-horsepower generators, and this year it plans to manufacture 6,000-horsepower generators to meet the needs of large-scale construction across the country. While the parade was being held in the city center, another 400,000 people marched in separate districts.

In the East China region, people in Nanjing, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Jinan and other places also held enthusiastic parades and celebrations.

华北 (Huabei - North China)

On May 1st, over 400,000 people in Tianjin braved the rain to hold a parade celebrating "May Day". The parade was conducted by district. The central district parade assembly, held in Central Park, began at 2:00 PM. Huang Huoqing, chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Wu De and Zhou Shutao, deputy mayors of the Municipal People's Government, reviewed the parade. In the parade, 25,000 workers held up various models and production charts, all of which showed the achievements of Tianjin workers' hard work to welcome "May Day" Labor Day and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. Employees of the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory completed their product plan one day ahead of schedule in April. In the "May Day" gift from the pressure material class workers of the factory, Miao Xiyan's improved method of cutting brake tubes alone increased work efficiency by 60 times. In the ranks of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau employees, a huge chart read: "Thanks to learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in burning low-value coal, power plants have saved 7.733 billion yuan in the past year." Construction workers brought a large model of the Second Workers' Cultural Palace Auditorium, which is being built at an accelerated pace and will soon appear near the workers' new village. The textile workers' ranks included Hao Jianxiu work method and 1951 Weaving Work Method promoters' team; their active leading role ensured the completion of the production plan and created a large amount of wealth for the country. In April, Tianjin's Fifth and Sixth Cotton Textile Factories both overfulfilled their product plans.

The Tianjin Young Pioneers, students, literary and art workers, medical workers, minority nationalities, industrial and commercial circles, religious circles, and athletes participating in the National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament and tennis and badminton demonstration matches also participated in the parade.

People in Taiyuan, Tangshan, Gui Sui and other places also held celebratory parades.

中南 (Zhongnan - Central South China)

Wuhan's working people enthusiastically celebrated "May Day" International Labor Day, holding a grand parade of 165,000 people. The parade was held at 10:00 AM on May 1st in Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang.

The parade included 100,000 workers, including construction workers, electrical workers, railway workers, seafarers, and textile workers from the three towns of Wuhan, each carrying production charts and models of new tools. Basic construction workers carried models of buildings and models of new tools they had invented. Since last year, they have created more than 30 kinds of new tools, which are the result of applying and learning advanced working methods such as Su Changyou's bricklaying method, which increased the work efficiency of Wuhan construction workers by five to seven times. Just a few days before "May Day" Labor Day, they also created a new record of laying 7,000 bricks per worker. They held up guarantee letters, guaranteeing to further accelerate national construction with creative labor. More than three hundred Hao Jianxiu workers and 1951 Weaving Work Method workers wearing white clothes walked proudly at the front of the 6,000-plus textile workers' ranks. Thanks to the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method, all three major yarn factories in Wuchang overfulfilled their cotton yarn production tasks for the first quarter. The South Factory of the First Yarn Factory completed its April production task two days ahead of schedule in the competition to welcome "May Day". The charts of the seafarers, who are responsible for the heavy task of Yangtze River shipping, showed that, thanks to the implementation of the Soviet Union's "one train" tug-barge transportation method on more than 60 percent of their ships, they had overfulfilled the transportation tasks of basic construction equipment and urban and rural industrial and agricultural products by 19 percent in the first quarter of this year.

The parade also included a workers' contingent actively laboring to support the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. They completed the task of sewing summer clothes for the Chinese People's Volunteers on schedule this year.

Suburban farmers came with excitement to participate in the first "May Day" Labor Day after the land reform. The charts they held up showed that, after the completion of the land reform in May last year, the total output of crops increased by 184 percent compared with 1949. Now they are continuing to intensify spring plowing and produce more grain to support national economic construction.

The parade also included government cadres, representatives of democratic parties, people from industrial and commercial circles, urban residents, and students.

The people of Guangzhou enthusiastically celebrated "May Day" International Labor Day. On the morning of May 1st, about 200,000 workers and people from all walks of life in the city held grand celebrations at twelve venues. The magnificent Yuexiu Mountain Stadium was the central venue of the meeting. Here, there were heroic troops of the People's Liberation Army vigilantly guarding the southern gate of the motherland, workers who were working selflessly to realize the motherland's first Five-Year Plan, overseas Chinese returning from abroad, and representatives of aquatic people from the South China coast and rivers. Some members of the Tibetan Tribute Group passing through Guangzhou also appeared at the venue today and celebrated this glorious festival with the working people of Guangzhou.

At the beginning of the celebration meeting, Wei Jinfei, Deputy Mayor of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, delivered a speech first. He congratulated the Guangzhou working class and all working people on their great achievements on all fronts in building the new Guangzhou. Then, Tan Zheng, Third Secretary of the South China Branch of the CPC Central Committee, gave a speech. He particularly pointed out that South China is located on the front line of the motherland's national defense and has thousands of miles of coastline and border lines. Therefore, the people of South China must maintain a high degree of vigilance, actively do various tasks, and strive to consolidate the national defense of South China.

In the parade, the workers' contingent, which gloriously completed the production tasks for the first quarter of this year, carried various huge charts to report their achievements to the people of the city. The chart of the workers of the Guangzhou Railway Transportation Sub-bureau read: "The car loading task for the first quarter of this year was completed by 113.9 percent." The basic construction workers' contingent holding up the huge slogan "Strive to complete the national basic construction plan!" was particularly welcomed by the broad masses of people.
