Xinhua News Agency dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech to newspaper editors on April 18, two days after Eisenhower addressed the American Society of Newspaper Editors luncheon.

Dulles used most of his speech to elaborate on the Eisenhower administration's so-called "strong foreign policy." He provided a review of the Eisenhower administration's first 90 days in office. The first thing he mentioned was the supposed "revival" of the "European Defense Community" plan, which "appeared to be dead" at the beginning of the year, but he still had to admit that "one cannot yet confidently predict that this plan will be realized."

Dulles further discussed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He admitted that "most member states feel that the NATO plan represents an effort they cannot continue to bear indefinitely," and the intense arms race has "exhausted all relevant countries." However, he said the United States "decided to find a plan" that "can be implemented for an indefinite period of time," with the "purpose and result of making NATO work more firmly and completing its original mission."

In his speech, Dulles vigorously praised the aggressive plans implemented by the Eisenhower administration in Asia, calling it a plan to "change the face of battle." According to Dulles, the specific content of this plan is that the United States has "greatly improved" its relationship with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, sent an "ambassador" stationed in Taipei, "is accelerating military assistance to them (Chiang Kai-shek)," etc.; announced that it would help "extinguish" the national liberation struggle in Vietnam; colluded with Britain, France, and other countries to intensify the so-called embargo against China; and "is considering" forming an aggressive front "from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan to Indochina and Malaya."

Dulles also mentioned that the United States is taking measures to consolidate its power in the Middle East and Latin America.

According to Dulles, all these actions taken by the United States since Eisenhower took office have given Eisenhower's speech the "support of positive actions," and others have only to "adapt" to American foreign policy. He emphasized that now it is the Soviet Union's turn to accept "Eisenhower's test." According to Dulles, this "test" requires not only accepting the various conditions put forward in Eisenhower's speech but also "actually and nominally abolishing and abandoning the Communist International Intelligence Bureau."

However, Dulles' speech did not receive a favorable response and aroused dissatisfied comments in bourgeois public opinion in the capitalist world.

The "Hindustan Times" pointed out in a commentary on the 21st that Dulles's remarks "are not a way to promote the cause of peace," and said: "Now is not the time to solve the problem of seeking peace from the point of view of demanding something, but from the point of view of being prepared to make concessions."

The "Indian Express" commented on the 22nd: "What Dulles is doing is only demanding everything from the Communists while offering nothing in exchange. Does this mean that he does not want reconciliation?"

The London "Times" believes that "it must be pointed out" that Dulles's words and what Eisenhower's speech promoted "have surprising irreconcilable places." The "Times" criticized the practice of "prescribing too many preconditions for talks."

British Labor Party Member of Parliament Desmond Donnelly criticized Dulles' speech as "the most stupid speech since the war" in a speech at a meeting on the 19th. He said: "The speech proves that either the US government is incredibly naive, or some of them really intend to wage war."

Even some U.S. senators believe that Dulles' approach is unworkable. Senator Cooper, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned the government on the 22nd not to adopt a "stubborn attitude." He said: "We cannot escape the fact that we must make concessions in some places."

    杜勒斯发表演说还在鼓吹侵略的外交政策
    引起资本主义世界资产阶级舆论的很大不满
   【新华社讯】在艾森豪威尔向美国报纸编辑协会午餐会发表他的演说后两天，美国国务卿杜勒斯四月十八日也向那些报纸编辑发表了一篇演说。
    杜勒斯用他演说的大部分着重阐述了艾森豪威尔政府的所谓“坚强的外交政策”。他对艾森豪威尔政府的头九十天的活动作了一个回叙。他提到的第一件事是所谓“复活了”在今年初“似乎是死了”的“欧洲防务集团”计划，但是他仍不得不承认“现在还不敢有信心地预言这个计划会实现”。
    杜勒斯进一步谈到了北大西洋公约。他承认：“大部分成员国都觉得北大西洋公约组织的计划代表一种他们不能无限期地继续承担的努力”，紧张的军备运动已“把所有有关国家都弄得筋疲力尽”。但是他说美国“决定寻找一项计划”，这个计划要
    “能够在一个无限期的时间中实行”，其“目的和结果是使北大西洋公约组织更坚定地工作下去，并完成它原定的任务”。
    杜勒斯在演说中极力赞扬艾森豪威尔政府在亚洲所实行的侵略计划，称为美国已开始实行一个“改变战斗面貌”的计划。据杜勒斯说这个计划的具体的内容是：美国“大大改善了”与台湾蒋匪帮的关系，派出了驻台北的“大使”，“正加速给予他们
    （蒋匪）军事援助”等等；宣布了要帮助“扑灭”越南的民族解放斗争；勾结了英、法等国加紧对中国的所谓禁运；以及“正在考虑”结成“从日本、朝鲜和台湾到印度支那和马来亚”的一条侵略战线。
    杜勒斯还谈到美国正采取措施，加紧巩固美国在中东和拉丁美洲的势力。
    照杜勒斯的说法，美国自艾森豪威尔上台后的这一切作为，使艾森豪威尔的演说有了“积极的行动的支持”，而别人就只有“适应”美国的外交政策了。他强调现在该苏联接受“艾森豪威尔的考验”了。按照杜勒斯的意思，这种“考验”除了接受艾森豪威尔演说中提出的各种条件以外，还得加上“在实际上与名义上取消和放弃共产党国际情报局”。
    但是，杜勒斯这篇演说并没有得到良好的反应，在资本主义世界的资产阶级舆论中也引起了不满的评论。
    “印度斯坦时报”二十一日在评论中指出杜勒斯的说话“并不是促进和平事业”的办法，并说：“现在不是从要求什么的观点来解决谋和的问题的时候，而是从准备作什么让步的观点来解决这个问题的时候。”
    “印度快报”在二十二日评论说：“杜勒斯所做的，是只向共产党要求一切东西，而自己却一样也不拿出来作为交换，这是不是表示他并不想和解？”
    伦敦“泰晤士报”认为“必须指出”杜勒斯的话和艾森豪威尔演说中所宣扬的东西“有出奇的不能调和的地方”。“泰晤士报”批评“为会谈规定太多的先决条件”的作法。
    英国的工党议员德斯蒙德·唐纳利十九日在一次会议上演说时批评杜勒斯的演说为“战后以来最愚蠢的一次演说”。他说：“演说证明不是美国政府天真到令人不能相信的地步，就是其中有些人真正有意进行战争。”
    连美国的某些参议员也认为杜勒斯这样的做法是行不通的。参议院军事委员会委员库柏二十二日警告政府不要采取“固执的态度”。他说：“我们不能逃避这个事实：有些地方我们必得让步。”
