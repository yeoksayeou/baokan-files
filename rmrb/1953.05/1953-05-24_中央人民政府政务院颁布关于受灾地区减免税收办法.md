    III. Vehicles, boats, and animal-powered transport organized by disaster victims, who hold disaster victim tax exemption certificates from the district and township people's governments, shall be exempt from temporary business tax on the transportation industry and vehicle and vessel license tax.

    IV. Farmers in disaster areas who entrust oil mills to process their own oil crops or exchange grain for oil, for their own use, may be exempt from commodity tax with the certification of the district and township people's governments.

    V. Disaster victims buying and selling livestock within the disaster area shall be exempt from transaction tax.

    VI. Grassroots organizations of grain companies and cooperatives that accept government-designated tasks and supply seeds to disaster areas at low prices shall be exempt from business tax.
