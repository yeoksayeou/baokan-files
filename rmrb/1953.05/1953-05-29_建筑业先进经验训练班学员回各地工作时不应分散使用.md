    Trainees from the Advanced Experience Training Class in the Construction Industry Should Not Be Dispersed When Returning to Work in Various Regions

    Fu Hongbin, a worker from the Tianjin Second Construction Engineering Company, writes: In the large-scale construction work of the motherland, basic construction work has been elevated to a very important position. At present, the technical skills and experience of general construction personnel are poor, so promoting advanced experience has become an important task. To this end, the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly ran an advanced experience training class in Tianjin, and invited labor models and advanced workers from the Northeast construction industry to teach various advanced working methods. The employees who participated in the study were organized according to work areas, including the work area director, the chief engineer, technicians of various types of work, team leaders and workers of the five types of work—carpentry, masonry, plastering, steel reinforcement, and concrete—as well as persons in charge of Party, government, labor union, and youth league affairs. At the end of the training, Zhou Rongxin, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, reported: In order to fully promote advanced experience, it is hoped that the comrades who come to study from various regions will not be dispersed after returning, but should be concentrated in one work area to create experience in promoting advanced experience. However, after we returned to Tianjin, we were dispersed when assigned work; in this way, the forces cannot be used in a concentrated manner, which is obviously detrimental to the promotion of advanced experience. This situation may also exist in other regions. I suggest that the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering understand the situation of the allocation of work for the trainees of the advanced experience training class in the construction industry after they return. If there are any improper uses, they should be quickly corrected.

    Reply from the General Office of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering

    A letter from the General Office of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering states: Our ministry, together with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, held a training class in Tianjin last December to promote advanced experience in the construction industry. At the end of the training class, it was instructed that students from various major regions should concentrate in one construction site after returning, in order to facilitate the promotion of advanced experience work. On February 10th of this year, our ministry formally instructed the major regions by telegram not to disperse the use of this group of students, and instructed the major regions to promptly report the situation of promoting advanced experience to the ministry; on February 25th, we sent another letter urging the reporting of this material. However, the major regions have not yet reported it. The situation reflected by Comrade Fu Hongbin may exist in other regions and deserves attention. In addition to hoping that the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau will investigate and deal with the problem reflected by Comrade Fu Hongbin, we also hope that the major regions can conduct a joint inspection of the allocation of work for this group of students and the promotion of advanced experience in typical construction sites.

### 建筑业先进经验训练班学员回各地工作时不应分散使用

专栏：读者来信摘要

    建筑业先进经验训练班学员回各地工作时不应分散使用
    天津市第二建筑工程公司工人傅鸿宾来信：在祖国大规模建设工作中，基本建设工作已被提到十分重要的地位。而目前一般施工人员技术差、经验少，推广先进经验就成为一个重要的工作。中央建筑工程部和中华全国总工会为此曾在天津联合开办了一个建筑业先进经验训练班，并邀请东北建筑业的劳动模范和先进工作者来讲授各种先进工作方法。我们参加学习的职工是按工区组织的，包括工区主任，主管工程师，各工种的技术员，木、瓦、抹灰、钢筋、混凝土五个工种的组长和工人，以及党政工团负责人等。在学习结束时，中央建筑工程部周荣鑫副部长报告说：为了全面地推广先进经验，希望各地来学习的同志们回去后不要分散，应该集中在一个工区，来创造推广先进经验的经验。但我们回到天津后，分配工作时却被分散了；这样力量就不能集中使用，对推广先进经验显然是不利的。这种情况可能在其它地区也有。我建议中央建筑工程部了解一下建筑业先进经验训练班学员们回去后的分配工作的情况，如有使用不当的，应该迅速加以纠正。
    中央建筑工程部办公厅的答复
    中央建筑工程部办公厅来信：我部会同中华全国总工会于去年十二月曾在天津举办推广建筑业先进经验训练班。训练班结束时，曾指示各大区学员回去后集中在一个工地，以利于推广先进经验工作。本年二月十日，我部又以电报正式指示各大区，不得分散使用该批学员，并责成各大区将推广先进经验情况及时报部；二月二十五日又曾再函催报该项材料。但至今各大区尚未报来。傅鸿宾同志所反映的情况，在其他地区可能有，是值得重视的。我部除希望天津市建筑工程局调查处理傅鸿宾同志反映的问题外，并希各大区均能对该项学员工作分配情况与典型工地推广先进经验工作情况一并作一检查。
