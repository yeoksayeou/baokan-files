Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 17th: Our correspondent reports: The fact that the U.S. Chief Delegate Harrison requested a three-day adjournment for "administrative reasons" has drawn the world's unanimous attention to the many crucial questions that the U.S. representative failed to answer on Saturday.

These questions are: Does Washington truly hope to achieve an armistice in Korea? If Washington truly wants an armistice, then why did it order Harrison to openly and unscrupulously demand the forced retention of prisoners of war, thereby undermining the basis for resuming armistice negotiations? Why does it insist on those unacceptable demands, knowing full well that they will bring the armistice to a standstill? World opinion believes that General Nam Il's eight-point proposal can serve as the basis for an immediate armistice and the immediate signing of an agreement in Korea, but why does it refuse to accept it?

Harrison either could not answer or refused to answer. But some of the answers can be found in the negotiation records of the past twenty-one days. During this period, just when the situation in Panmunjom made it seem that an armistice was imminent, the United States openly overturned the basis of the negotiations, and the United States' lack of sincerity reached its peak. The final answer is in Washington, where elements opposed to the armistice have been clamoring for "going it alone."

Obviously, the U.S. government thinks it can fool world opinion, just as it did when it suspended the Panmunjom negotiations last year. It has always ignored the opinions of its "allies" and has unilaterally controlled the entire Panmunjom negotiations for nearly two years.

This is not the first time that U.S. negotiators have raised absurd questions at the conference table, dashing the hopes of the world for an early armistice in Korea. But Harrison has gone too far this time. He openly disregards the world's hope for peace and undermines the basis of the current negotiations, making it impossible to discuss major issues and achieve an armistice in Korea. This time, Washington suffered a heavy blow, because world opinion has clearly told it that the world's hope for an armistice must not be ignored.

As a result of the continuous efforts of the Korean and Chinese side, various differences have been eliminated one by one, and the armistice has never been so close at hand. All excuses for delaying the signing of the agreement have been eliminated, and the U.S. representative's last resort is to reverse the negotiations, demanding that prisoners of war be handed over to their enemies to be disposed of at will. The most obvious manifestation of the U.S. stalling policy reaching its end is Harrison's bringing up the old and unfounded fabrication of 50,000 missing prisoners of war, a claim that had actually been abandoned by Admiral Joy a year ago.

Harrison's lengthy twenty-six-point counterproposal cannot conceal the real issue. That is the difference between an immediate armistice and evading an armistice. The U.S. demand that prisoners of war be handed over to Syngman Rhee or Chiang Kai-shek immediately upon the armistice or sixty days after the armistice is merely a deliberate attempt to create chaos in order to evade the armistice. In fact, an armistice could be achieved immediately if General Nam Il's eight-point proposal were adopted as the basis for the agreement.

Harrison has repeatedly told the world that prisoners of war must be handed over to neutral countries for custody in Korea. But when General Nam Il agreed to this, Harrison refused to hand them over to neutral countries and instead demanded that the prisoners of war be "released as civilians" in South Korea. The phrase "released as quickly as possible" is tantamount to sentencing prisoners of war to indefinite detention and exile in the areas of detention as quickly as possible. In this way, an armistice can be avoided, because this measure will never be accepted in equal negotiations.

Harrison agreed to organize a neutral nation repatriation committee, but he immediately put forward a series of restrictions to emasculate its functions. This committee will be under the threat of U.S. armed forces and personnel, and it may be rendered nominal due to the manipulation of veto power. In addition to the short time limit of only sixty days, only one representative per thousand prisoners of war is allowed to conduct explanatory work within a certain period of time. Before this committee could play its role, Harrison attempted to threaten it by saying that the neutral countries on the committee were "satellite states" and that they were "under pressure." These unwarranted restrictions would allow Washington to delay negotiations at will.

The U.S. plan is to keep the prisoners of war under their threat and influence. Harrison estimates that according to this plan, there will still be prisoners of war who have not been repatriated when the time limit for neutral countries to take care of prisoners of war expires. This is obviously a post-armistice issue that can be resolved by a higher-level political conference. Harrison could not say why the higher-level political conference could not resolve this issue, but simply refused to entrust the final handling of these prisoners of war to the political conference. Such a post-armistice issue that could be resolved by a post-armistice political conference may also be used by Washington to delay the armistice indefinitely.

However, the whole world knows clearly that as long as the U.S. representative accepts General Nam Il's eight-point proposal as the basis for the agreement, an armistice can be achieved at any time. The question is whether the U.S. government wants an armistice at all. So far, it has not been able to pass this test, and the actions of its representatives in Panmunjom have proved that it is evading an immediate armistice in Korea.

### 美国拖延停战政策已到穷途末路

    美国拖延停战政策已到穷途末路
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者报道：美国首席代表哈利逊为了“行政性的理由”而要求休会三天一事，已使全世界一致地注意美国代表在星期六所没有回答的很多含有决定意义的问题。
    这些问题是：华盛顿方面是否真正希望在朝鲜实现停战？如果华盛顿方面真要想停战的话，那末为什么它又下令哈利逊公然无忌地要求强迫扣留战俘而破坏恢复停战谈判的基础？为什么它明知它的那些不能被接受的要求会使停战陷于僵局，还是要坚持那些要求？全世界舆论都认为南日将军的八点建议可以作为朝鲜立即停战和立即签订一项协定的基础，而为什么它却加以拒绝接受？
    哈利逊或者是不能回答，或者是拒绝回答。但是在过去二十一天的谈判记录中却可以找到一部分的答案。在这期间，正当板门店的情况使人觉得停战马上在望的时候，美国却公开推翻了谈判基础，美国毫无诚意的表现至此达到极点。最后的答案是在华盛顿，在那里反对停战的分子曾极力叫嚣“单独干下去”。
    很显然的，美国政府以为它能够像去年它在中止板门店谈判时那样，愚弄世界的舆论。它一向对它的“盟友”的意见置之不理，而且在将近两年的期间里一向一手包办整个板门店谈判。
    美国谈判代表并不是第一次在会议桌上提出荒谬的问题，使全世界祈求朝鲜早日停战的希望落了空。但是哈利逊这次走得太远了。他公然不顾全世界对和平的希望，而破坏目前谈判的基础，使得无法讨论主要的问题和实现朝鲜停战。这一次，华盛顿却挨着了一下猛烈的打击，因为世界舆论已明告它，世界要求停战的希望决不能被抛在一旁不理。
    由于朝中方面不断努力的结果，种种的分歧意见已经一一地被消除，而停战从来没有这样近在眼前。所有拖延签订协定的借口都已经被消除，美国代表的最后一手就只有使谈判开倒车，要求把战俘交给其敌人任意摆布。美国拖延政策已到了穷途末路，这最明显的表现就是哈利逊抬出老一套的毫无根据的关于五万名失踪战俘的捏造事实，实际上这种说法已为乔埃海军上将在一年前抛弃了。
    哈利逊的冗繁的二十六点反建议并不能掩遮住真正问题所在。那就是立即停战和逃避停战两者的分歧。美国要求在一俟停战或是在停战六十天以后，立即把战俘交给李承晚或蒋介石，此举只不过是故意造就纷乱以逃避停战而已，实际上要是根据南日将军的八点建议的话，是可以立即获得停战的。
    哈利逊曾一再向全世界说，必须把战俘交给中立国在朝鲜看管。但是在南日将军同意这一点时，哈利逊又拒绝把他们交给中立国看管了，他又提出要求，把战俘在南朝鲜“释放为平民”。“尽可能快予以释放”这句话无异于尽可能快地宣判把战俘扣留和使他们无限期地流落在拘留方面的地区里。这样停战就可以避免，因为这个措施在平等的谈判中是永远不会被接受的。
    哈利逊同意组织中立国遣返委员会，但是他又立即提出一大串的限制，以阉割它的职能。这个委员会将处于美国武装部队和人员的威胁之下，它可能由于否决权的操纵而陷于有名无实。除了时限仅有短短的六十天之外，每一千名的战俘只准由一个代表在一定的时间内进行解释工作。这个委员会还没有来得及发挥它的作用，哈利逊就企图威胁它，说委员会的中立国是“卫星国”，说它们“受到压力”。这些毫无理由的限制就能够让华盛顿随心所欲地拖延谈判。
    美国的计划是使战俘继续处于他们的威胁和影响之下，哈利逊估计，按照这个计划，在中立国看管战俘的时限完结之后，仍有留着没有遣返的战俘。这显然是一个停战之后的问题，是可以由高一级的政治会议来解决的。哈利逊也说不出为什么高一级的政治会议不能解决这个问题，只是干脆拒绝把这些战俘的最后处理工作交给政治会议负责。这样一个本可以由停战后的政治会议解决的停战后的问题，也可能被华盛顿利用来无限期地拖延停战。
    但是，全世界都清楚地知道，只要美国代表接受南日大将的八点建议为协议的基础，停战是随时可以实现的。问题在于，美国政府到底要不要停战。至今为止，它一直没有能够通过这个考验，它在板门店的代表的行为证明了它规避在朝鲜马上取得停战。
