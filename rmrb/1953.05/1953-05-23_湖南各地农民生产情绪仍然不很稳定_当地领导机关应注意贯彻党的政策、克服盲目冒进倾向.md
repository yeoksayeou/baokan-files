After the Central Committee issued instructions on spring plowing and production, various parts of Hunan Province rationally arranged various tasks, and have basically achieved the goal of making spring plowing and production the overriding central task in rural areas. The working methods of rural work cadres at all levels are also beginning to improve. However, in many areas, the implementation of production policies is still not well done, so the farmers' production mood is not stable enough, hindering the development of production enthusiasm. The most prominent manifestation is the extremely abnormal lending relationship, the phenomenon of forced and disguised forced lending is very common, and often only borrowing without repaying. In some places, some people even take rude and unreasonable means to "borrow grain" from wealthy households. This not only closes the door to lending, but also hurts the unity within the peasants, which greatly hinders spring plowing and production. Some middle peasants have very low production mood, saying: "Poverty is comfortable, wealth is worrying", "Production is not as good as eating more, and socialism will arrive in a few days." The phenomenon of infringing on private property is also more common in mutual aid groups. The main reason is mutual aid without mutual benefit. Some mutual aid groups stipulate that middle peasants' cattle and farm tools are used without compensation, and farm tools are not repaired when they are broken. Some propose "use cattle if you have them, cultivate good land," and "middle peasants should be more open-minded and take out money." In addition, there are some phenomena of arbitrary apportionments. Some places arbitrarily cut down the mountains and forests of middle peasants, occupy the fields of rich peasants, and arbitrarily exchange the fields of landlords after land reform.

The tendency of blindly advancing in agricultural production is also quite serious in Hunan. This is mainly manifested in two aspects: one is the blindly advancing in mutual aid and cooperation, pursuing advanced forms, and ignoring ideological education. Some townships have hastily organized 80 to 90 percent of the peasants, and some year-round mutual aid groups have not yet been consolidated before agricultural production cooperatives are established. The other is that the popularization of agricultural technology does not proceed from reality, mechanically copying, not good at summarizing and promoting the existing experience of peasants, not taking care of peasants' production habits, and some even force peasants to change the planting season. In some areas of the Xiangtan Special District, it was blindly proposed to expand double-cropping rice to 80 percent at once.

In some counties of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, the masses' sowing time was blindly advanced by half a month to twenty days, resulting in crop damage due to the rainy season.

In addition, prohibiting gambling, exposing rumors, strengthening public security work, and stabilizing social order are also important issues that should be paid attention to in rural Hunan at present. To solve these problems, publicity alone is not enough, and the Party's policies must be earnestly implemented in action. Education should be strengthened for organized peasants, mutual aid and cooperation organizations should be rectified with emphasis, and typical examples should be selected to commend those mutual aid groups that conform to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and criticize some behaviors of mutual aid without mutual benefit. We must strictly ban anyone from illegally apportioning or extorting money. Debt disputes since liberation should be handled properly and cautiously. In principle, it must be affirmed that there is borrowing and repayment; specific handling can be negotiated by the relevant parties according to the situation, either by repaying in one lump sum, or by repaying in installments, or by renewing the contract and postponing repayment. In this way, the door to lending will be able to open in the future. In the past, some places held meetings of wealthy households to persuade them to lend, but this method had great side effects and should not be used again in the future. (Zhang Buqun)

    湖南各地农民生产情绪仍然不很稳定
    当地领导机关应注意贯彻党的政策、克服盲目冒进倾向
    湖南省各地在中央关于春耕生产的指示发布以后，合理地安排了各项工作，已经基本上做到了把春耕生产作为农村压倒一切的中心工作，各级农村工作干部的工作方法也正开始改进。但是，许多地区对于生产政策的贯彻仍然做得不好，因此，农民生产情绪还不够稳定，障碍着生产积极性的发挥。最突出的表现是借贷关系极不正常，强迫和变相强迫借贷的现象很普遍，而且常常只借不还。个别的地方竟有些人采取蛮横无理的手段到富裕户“借粮”。这样不仅封闭了借贷之门，而且伤害了农民内部的团结，对春耕生产妨碍极大。一些中农生产情绪很低，说：“贫穷自在，富贵多忧”、“生产不如多吃，几天就到社会主义。”互助组中侵犯私人财产的现象也较普遍。主要是互助不互利，有的互助组规定中农耕牛、农具无代价地使用，农具坏了也不修理。有的提出“有牛就用，好地就耕”，“中农要放开明些，有钱拿出来”。另外，还有些胡乱摊派的现象。有些地方随便砍中农的山林，侵占富农的田地，土地改革后随便调换地主的田地。
    农业生产上盲目冒进的倾向在湖南也相当严重。这主要表现在两个方面：一种是互助合作上的盲目冒进，追求高级形式，忽视思想教育。有的乡将百分之八九十的农民都过急地组织起来，有的常年互助组尚不巩固就成立农业生产合作社。另一种是推广农业技术不从实际出发，机械搬运，不善于总结推广农民的现有经验，不照顾农民生产习惯，有的甚至强制农民更改耕作季节。湘潭专区有些地区盲目提出要把双季稻一下子扩大到百分之八十。
    湘西苗族自治区有的县竟将群众播种时间盲目地提早半月至二十天，结果秧苗因正逢雨季而受到损失。
    此外，禁止赌博、揭破谣言、加强治安工作、稳定社会秩序，也是湖南农村当前应注意的重要问题。要解决这些问题，光宣传是不够的，必须在行动上切实贯彻执行党的政策。对组织起来的农民要加强教育，对互助合作组织要有重点地进行整顿，并应选择典型，表扬那些合乎自愿互利原则的互助组，批评一些互助不互利的行为。要严格取缔任何人违法摊派、敲榨勒索的现象。对解放以来的债务纠纷应作妥当的慎重的处理，原则上必须肯定有借有还；具体处理可根据情况由有关双方协商，或一次还，或分期还，或换约缓还。这样，今后借贷之门才有可能打开。过去有些地方召开富裕户的会议进行劝借，这种方式副作用很大，今后不宜再用。    （张布群）
