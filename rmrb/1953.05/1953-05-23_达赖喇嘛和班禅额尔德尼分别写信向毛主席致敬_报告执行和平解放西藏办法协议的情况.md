Major cities and towns in the Tibetan region will hold grand celebrations together with the local People's Liberation Army.

The Tibetan local government has also provided great assistance and is currently implementing the agreement. In the future, we will continue to work hard to fully and thoroughly implement the seventeen-article agreement. Respectfully requesting your attention.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 22nd: On the eve of the second anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Panchen Erdeni wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting on the implementation of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet over the past two years. The original text is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

The second anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet is a day of great historical significance for the Tibetan monks and laypeople to embark on a bright and happy path. On behalf of all the monks, lay officials, and people of Tashilhunpo Monastery, I extend my highest respects to you.

The Tibetan people, who had long been oppressed and exploited by imperialist aggressive forces, finally returned to the warm embrace of the motherland two years ago, thanks to your wise leadership, and enjoyed the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief. This is a great joy that the Tibetan people will never forget for generations to come.

After returning to the embrace of the motherland, the Tibetan monks and laypeople immediately responded to the call of the motherland, strengthened unity, implemented the agreement, and actively supported the People's Liberation Army, firmly guarding the national defense of the motherland. We monks and laypeople have many happy things to report to you regarding the implementation of the agreement over the past two years:

First, the staff sent by the Central Government to Tibet and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, under the direct leadership of General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and General Zhang Guohua, commander of the Tibet Military Region, have promoted the spirit of unity, democracy, and consultation, faithfully implemented the agreement, and faithfully implemented the national and religious policies. Our religious beliefs and customs have been protected and respected. Every year during the New Year and religious festivals, they cordially congratulate us and present gifts according to Tibetan customs. All the staff members also consult with the Dalai Lama and my officials, Khenpos, and headmen on relevant matters like good friends. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army not only abide by the rules and engage in fair trade, helping the monks and laypeople in production and labor, but also highly respect the customs of monasteries and residents in various places. Lamas recite scriptures peacefully, and many religious festivals and gatherings are more stable and lively than before.

Second, the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality is becoming increasingly consolidated. Although the Dalai Lama and I are far apart in "Wei" and "Tsang," we constantly exchange letters and telegrams, encouraging each other to earnestly implement the agreement and exchanging experiences in studying Buddhist scriptures; the monks and lay officials of the "Kashag" and the "Panchen Kampus Conference Hall" also have close contacts. Under your leadership, the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality is also strengthening. All these make the monks and laypeople happy, and the strength for implementing the agreement and building a new Tibet is constantly increasing.

Third, various economic, cultural, and health undertakings in Tibet have begun to move from backwardness towards recovery and development. Agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce have all received support from the People's Liberation Army and the national financial authorities, especially agricultural and industrial loans and the purchase of wool, which have been welcomed by people from all walks of life. The Lhasa Hospital and primary schools are well-run, and the Shigatse primary school will soon open, and the medical clinic is being expanded into a people's hospital. Monks, lay officials, and the public have Tibetan books, newspapers, and pictorials, and often see movies and dramas. All your care makes the people feel sincerely grateful.

In the past, imperialist aggressors, the Manchu Qing government, and the Kuomintang reactionary government all stood above the Tibetan people, plunging the long-standing Tibetan nationality into a state of near death. Since the establishment of the new country under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, people of all ethnic groups in the country have been liberated, and the Tibetan nationality and monks and laypeople have also begun to gain new life. The Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet has more clearly brought a bright and splendid future for the development of the Tibetan nationality. Over the past two years, we have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's brilliance shines on our happy future. This is the good fortune of all beings in the Tibetan nationality, and the three realms (the realm of the gods, the realm of scriptures, and the realm of lamas) are all cheering and celebrating.

Respected Chairman Mao: We wish you a long life and good health! In the future, we are determined to further strengthen the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, as well as with all fraternal nationalities, under your leadership, the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, to further strengthen the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality, to more faithfully implement the agreement, to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, and to actively participate in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, to participate in the great construction of the motherland, and to contribute the strength of the Tibetan people to defending the motherland and defending world peace, seeking closer unity and happiness for the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and seeking increasing prosperity for the Tibetan monks and laypeople.

    【新华社拉萨二十二日电】班禅额尔德尼在西藏和平解放两周年前夕，上书毛主席，报告两年来执行和平解放西藏办法的协议的情况。原文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    和平解放西藏办法的协议签订两周年纪念日，是西藏僧俗人民走向光明幸福道路的具有伟大历史意义的日子，我谨代表扎什伦布寺全体僧俗官员民众，向您致崇高的敬礼。
    长期被帝国主义侵略势力压迫、剥削的西藏民族，由于您的英明领导，终于在两年前回到了祖国温暖大家庭的怀抱，享受到民族平等和信教自由的权利，这是西藏人民永世万代也忘不了的大喜事。
    西藏僧俗人民回到祖国大家庭以后立即响应祖国的号召，加强团结，执行协议，并积极支援人民解放军，巩固地守卫着祖国国防。协议执行两年以来，我们僧俗人民有许多高兴的事情向您报告：
    第一、中央派到西藏的工作人员和入藏的人民解放军，在中央人民政府代表张经武将军、西藏军区司令员张国华将军直接领导下，发扬了团结民主协商的精神，忠实地执行着协议，忠实执行民族政策和宗教政策。我们的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，受到了保护和尊重。每到过年和宗教节日，都按照西藏风俗，关怀地向我们祝贺、赠礼，全体工作人员对达赖喇嘛和我的官员、堪布、头人等，也像好朋友一样商量办理有关的事情。解放军的指战员们，不但规规矩矩，公买公卖，帮助僧俗人民生产劳动，还十分尊重各地寺院、居民的风俗习惯，喇嘛们平平安安地诵经，许多宗教节日和集会比以前更安定更热闹了。
    第二、西藏民族内部团结日益巩固了。达赖和我虽远处“卫”、“藏”，但不断互通书电，以认真执行协议，互相勉励，交换进修经义心得；“噶厦”和“班禅堪布会议厅”僧俗官员间，也来往密切，西藏民族内部也在您的领导下团结起来了。这些，都使僧俗人民欢喜，执行协议建设新西藏的力量正在不断地加强。
    第三、西藏地方的经济、文化、卫生各项事业，开始从落后状态走向恢复和发展。农牧工商业都得到了解放军和国家财经机关的扶植，特别是农、工业贷款和收购羊毛，受到各界人民欢迎。拉萨医院和小学办得很好，日喀则的小学不久就要开学，医疗所也正在扩大为人民医院。僧俗官员、民众有了藏文的书报画刊，还经常看到电影和戏剧。所有您的关怀使人民衷心地感激。
    过去帝国主义侵略者，满清政府和国民党反动政府，都是站在西藏人民头上的，曾使历史悠久的西藏民族，陷入濒于死亡的境地。在您和中国共产党领导下的新国家成立以来，国内各族人民得到解放，西藏民族和僧俗人民也开始获得了新生，和平解放西藏协议更明确地带来了西藏民族光辉灿烂的发展前途，两年来，我们已经深深感觉到毛主席的光辉照耀着我们幸福的前途，这是西藏民族众生之幸，三界（天界、经界、喇嘛界）都在欢呼庆祝。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们向您祝万年健康！今后我们决心在您、中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，进一步加强汉、藏民族以及和所有兄弟民族的团结，进一步加强西藏民族内部的团结，更忠实地执行协议，建设繁荣幸福的新西藏，并积极地参加抗美援朝运动，参加祖国大建设，为保卫祖国保卫世界和平贡献出西藏人民的力量，求祖国各族人民日臻亲密幸福，西藏僧俗人民日臻昌盛。
    班禅额尔德尼
