    Trade Union Work on Construction Sites
    —A Special Interview on the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    By our reporter Fan Rongkang
    When you celebrate the harvests brought by the Huai River water conservancy project, when you ride the train on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway that cuts through mountains, when you move into your new home in Cao Yang New Village, when you dance with friends in the newly built cultural palace, when you open your books in a new classroom filled with sunshine, when you toast the countless renovated, expanded, and newly built factories and mines of the motherland, and the first Five-Year Plan of the motherland, have you ever thought of those construction workers who bring happiness to the people and glory to the motherland—beside you, on every building in the motherland, are recorded their hard work and wisdom; in the first year of the Five-Year Plan, they are striving to build a new industrialized China with selfless labor.

    Many outstanding labor models and trade union workers among them attended the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. The experiences of these representatives mark the growth of a powerful basic construction force.

    In the past, there was a saying: "The carpenter guards the broken gate, the bricklayer has no house to live in, and the stonemason dies without a tombstone." This saying was filled with the tears and hatred of construction workers; it was the long-term social experience of construction workers. After liberation, this social experience often prevented them from quickly realizing that they were the masters of the country, and the construction site was their home. Therefore, as Comrade Lai Ruoyu pointed out in his report to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions: in the trade union work of basic construction, we must first strengthen political work. The basic construction trade union workers who attended the meeting have done just that in the past few years, and their experience is precisely this.

    Yang Qinglin, chairman of the trade union at the Seamless Steel Tube Plant construction site of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, said: "Where there is political work, there is a guarantee for the project." The entire project of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, one of the three major construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which was built on a vast expanse of ruins and is of concern to the people of the whole country, is nearing completion. The enormous scale and complex technical nature of this project are well known. Just think of the tens of thousands of foundation bolts, each of which must have a tolerance of no more than three to five millimeters from the center line, a tolerance that is almost impossible for the human eye to distinguish, and you will marvel at the progress and quality of this project, and you will dedicate the most beautiful words of praise to the workers who built this Seamless Steel Tube Plant.

    However, in the beginning, the situation was not so optimistic.

    Trade union chairman Yang Qinglin came to the Seamless construction site on June 30, 1952, when the old factory buildings were still being cleared. The workers came from six specialized engineering companies and five affiliated processing plants. The first impression these workers from all directions gave was not the scale of the project, but the difficulty of the work. In the engineering teams from the electrical installation engineering company and the metal structure engineering company, there was no trade union chairman; in the engineering teams from the civil construction engineering company, more than 80 percent of the workers were peasants who had just come from the countryside, and their idea was to work for a while and then go home, saying, "After repairing the dam for three years, I didn't get anything. This time, I'll take advantage of the working class." Coupled with the poor living conditions, in some places, five hundred people were crammed into a broken building. At that time, the workers' opinions of the Seamless construction site were: "Seamless factory, leaky building, no oil in the food, eating cornbread, living in a big broken building."

    The Seamless construction site trade union changed the face of the construction site with its own political work. After the establishment of the construction site trade union, the trade union focused on the Wang Jinzhong team to conduct a detailed ideological investigation, which enabled the trade union to understand the workers. At that time, among the 239 members of the Wang Jinzhong team, two-thirds were temporary workers, who called themselves "temporary working class" and held the attitude of just getting by for a while. Why? They thought that since they were temporary workers, they wouldn't be working for long anyway. Thus, the other side of the temporary workers' mentality of getting by for a while was the desire to become permanent workers.

    Administratively, in accordance with the needs of the project and the workers' demands, a large number of workers were made permanent. The trade union seized the work of making workers permanent and carried out ideological education, calling on workers to work actively and strive for permanent status, and combined this with education on the long-term prospects of national industrialization and socialism. This education started from linking with reality. They held meetings of real people and real events, focusing on publicizing the advanced ideas and deeds of the special-class labor model Wang Jinzhong. Wang Jinzhong, the son of a peasant, had a life as ordinary as the lives of many workers. His honor became an honor that all workers could obtain, and his advanced deeds became a force to encourage all workers to move forward. The trade union publicized to the workers the significance of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant to the national industrialization, letting the workers know that the exploration of underground resources, agricultural mechanization, and the manufacture of airplanes and locomotives all awaited the supply of Seamless Steel Tubes.

    The trade union work at the Seamless construction site thus started with ideological investigation, understood the workers, guided the workers to overcome backward ideas, practically improved the workers' living conditions, and later launched a struggle against the phenomenon of no one being responsible. On the basis of establishing a responsibility system, labor competitions were carried out to ensure the progress and quality of the project, and the trade union work at the construction site also became regularized. In nearly a year of construction, the face of the construction site and the ideological life of the workers were changed, the famous Zhang Jiaming foundation bolt installation method, Wang Jinzhong team's rapid concrete grouting method, and the three-dimensional parallel large-scale continuous operation method from high altitude, ground, to more than ten meters underground were summarized. Ten model teams, twenty-four model groups, and two hundred and ninety-seven labor models emerged. The Wang Jinzhong team, which initially had two-thirds of its workers calling themselves "temporary working class" and holding the attitude of just getting by for a while, is now known on the construction site for its high labor discipline and work efficiency.

    In recent years, what people have found most unforgettable is the creative improvement of operation methods, tools, and labor organization by the workers in basic construction. These creative improvements have accelerated the development of the motherland's construction cause. A central topic of trade union work in basic construction is how to summarize and promote these advanced experiences and organize workers to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. The important position of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences in the trade union work of basic construction is not only because the state's requirements for basic construction are good, fast, and economical, and summarizing and promoting advanced experiences is the material guarantee for achieving good, fast, and economical; nor is it only because real life has educated the workers in basic construction that only by mastering advanced experiences can they become outstanding basic construction workers; but also because the manual operation methods and individual labor organization of most projects in basic construction have amazing production potential. Wang Mengzhong, deputy director of the Construction Trade Union Working Committee of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, said: "Manual operation methods and individual labor organization are reflected in the project as low efficiency, but it is precisely the low efficiency that reflects the great potential. Therefore, an improvement in an operation, the appearance of a new tool, an improvement in a labor organization, and the promotion of an advanced experience in civil construction will greatly increase labor productivity."

    The story of Fu Hongbin, a construction worker from Tianjin and a representative to the congress, who invented the mortar spreader, proves this.

    In the spring of 1951, after Fu Hongbin returned to Tianjin from the first phase of the skilled worker training class of the former China Construction Company in Beijing, he accepted the position of group leader. This group was an abandoned group with low work efficiency and poor unity, and no one wanted to be the group leader.

    Fu Hongbin came. He first discovered that although these thirty-odd workers had shortcomings, they were basically good. The problem was how the group leader could lead the group politically and technically. With the enthusiasm of the working class and young people, an open mind, and a willingness to take the lead, Fu Hongbin first led the group politically. But what about the technical aspects? Improving work efficiency still requires technical guarantees!

    Look at those workers: bending over once to mix mortar, bending over again to pick up bricks, bending over again to mix mortar, and bending over several times when applying mortar strips to the wall. It's really like bowing six or seven times for every brick laid, and after laying six or seven hundred bricks a day, you're already sore, tired, and drenched in sweat. Can you say they are slacking off? Can you ask them to increase their labor intensity to improve work efficiency? Obviously, this is not possible.

    Fu Hongbin thought for a long time, and finally found the key from the act of bowing six or seven times for every brick laid. It would be great if the bricklayer only took care of laying bricks and didn't have to spread mortar! If they could stand up straight and work with all their might, how fast would that be! Fu Hongbin and the workers in the group explored and researched, and with the help of engineers, after more than thirty improvements, they invented the mortar spreader.

    This liberated the bricklayers from the old operation method of bowing six or seven times for every brick laid.

    This mortar spreader advanced a part of the bricklaying work from manual operation one step further. The workers called it a "tractor." Fu Hongbin's group universally adopted the mortar spreader for bricklaying, and also learned the Su Changyou bricklaying method, laying bricks continuously in sections, changing the individual operation that had existed for thousands of years. In this way, work efficiency was more than 300% higher than the old method of bricklaying, and the mortar was spread evenly, the quality was good, and the labor intensity was reduced instead.

    A powerful basic construction force of the motherland has grown up, and their hard work and wisdom have earned them lofty honor. The task of basic construction trade union workers is to continuously strengthen political work, raise the class consciousness of workers, strengthen labor discipline, care for workers' lives, summarize and promote advanced experiences, so that this constantly expanding basic construction force will continue to consolidate and strengthen, and strive for the industrialization of the motherland and the transition to socialism!

    工地上的工会工作
    ——中国工会第七次全国代表大会专题访问
    本报记者　范荣康
    当你为淮河水利带来丰收而庆贺的时候，当你坐上穿山越岭的成渝铁路列车的时候，当你搬进曹杨新村的新的住宅的时候，当你和朋友们在新建的文化宫跳舞的时候，当你在满照着阳光的新课堂里打开书本的时候，当你为祖国无数个改建、扩建和新建的工厂矿山，为祖国第一个五年建设计划而干杯的时候，你可曾想起那些为人民带来幸福，为祖国增添光荣的基本建设的工人们——在你的身旁，在祖国的每一座建筑上，都记载着他们的辛劳和智慧；在五年建设计划开始的第一年里，他们正以忘我的劳动为建设工业化的新中国而奋斗。
    他们中的许多杰出的劳动模范和工会工作者，出席了中国工会第七次全国代表大会。这些代表们的经历，标志着一支强大的基本建设队伍已经成长起来。
    从前，有这样一句话：“木工守着破大门，瓦工没房住，石工死了墓上没碑文”。这句话染满了建筑工人们的眼泪和仇恨；这是建筑工人们的长时期的社会经验。这种社会经验，在解放后常常使他们不能很快地意识到自己已是国家的主人，工地就是自己的家。因此，正如赖若愚同志在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上的报告里所指出的那样：在基本建设的工会工作中首先要加强政治工作。到会的基本建设工会工作者这几年来也正是这样做的，他们的经验也正是这样。
    鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂工地工会主席杨清林同志这样说：“那里有政治工作，那里的工程就有保证”。这个在一片空旷的废墟上建设起来的，为全国人民所关怀的鞍钢三大建设工程之一的无缝钢管厂全部工程已接近完成。这个工程的巨大规模和复杂的技术性是人们早就知道的。只要想一想那数以万计的地脚螺丝，每一个地脚螺丝与中心线的公差不能超过三公厘至五公厘，而这个公差是人们的肉眼绝难分辨的，那么，你就会惊叹这个工程的进度和质量，你就会把最美丽的赞词献给建设这座无缝钢管厂的工人们。
    可是，在一开始的时候，情况是没有这样乐观的。
    工会主席杨清林在一九五二年六月三十日来到无缝工地，那时候还正在清扫旧厂房。工人们来自六个专业工程公司和五个附属加工厂。这些来自四面八方的工人们首先使人感到的还不是工程巨大，而是工作难做。从电气安装工程公司、金属结构工程公司来的工程队里，工会没有主席；土木建筑工程公司的工程队里，百分之八十以上的工人是刚从农村来的农民，他们的想法是混一个时期回家，所谓“修了三年坝，什么没有捞到，这次借工人阶级的光，捞一把”。加上生活条件不好，有的地方，五百人挤在一个破楼里。那时候，工人们对无缝工地的意见是：“无缝厂，有缝楼，大菜没有油，吃的窝窝头，住的是大破楼。”
    无缝工地的工会是以自己的政治工作来改变工地的面貌的。工地工会成立后，工会就以王进忠小队为重点，进行了一次细致的思想调查，这个调查使工会了解了工人。当时王进忠小队二百三十九人中，有三分之二是临时工，他们自称为“临时工人阶级”，抱着混一个时期就拉倒的态度。为什么呢？他们认为既然是临时工，反正干不长。这样就发现临时工混一个时期的另一面的思想是要求固定下来。
    行政上根据工程需要和工人们的要求，大批地固定工人。工会抓紧固定工人的工作进行思想教育，号召工人们积极工作，争取固定，并结合着进行国家工业化和社会主义的远景教育。这些教育从联系实际着手。他们开了真人真事会，着重宣传了特等劳动模范王进忠的先进思想和先进事迹。王进忠，这个农民的儿子的一生和许多工人们的一生一样平凡，他的荣誉成为所有的工人们都可能得到的荣誉，他的先进事迹成为鼓励所有的工人们前进的力量。工会向工人们宣传了无缝钢管厂对国家工业化的意义，让工人们知道，地下资源的勘探，农业机械化，飞机、火车头的制造等大规模的经济建设都等待着无缝钢管的供应。
    无缝工地的工会工作就这样从思想调查开始，了解了工人，引导工人克服了落后的思想，切实改善了工人的生活条件，后来又展开了反对无人负责现象的斗争，在建立责任制的基础上进行劳动竞赛，保证了工程的进度和质量，工地工会工作也走上正规。在将近一年的施工中改变了工地的面貌和工人们的思想生活，总结了著名的张甲明安装地脚螺丝施工法，王进忠小队浇灌混凝土快速灌浆法和从高空、地面、直到深达十余公尺的地下的立体平行大流水作业法，涌现出十个模范班，二十四个模范小组和二百九十七个劳动模范。当初有三分之二的工人自称为“临时工人阶级”，抱着混一个时期的态度的王进忠小队，现在是以高度的劳动纪律和工作效率在工地上闻名了。
    这几年来，人们最难忘记的是基本建设中的工人们对操作方法、工具和劳动组织方面的创造性的改进，这些创造性的改进加速了祖国建设事业发展的速度。基本建设中的工会工作的一个中心课题也就是如何总结和推广这些先进经验与组织工人学习苏联先进经验。总结和推广先进经验在基本建设工会工作中的重要地位，不仅是因为国家对基本建设的要求是又好、又快、又省，而总结和推广先进经验就是作到又好、又快、又省的物质保证；也不仅是因为现实生活教育了基本建设中的工人们，只有掌握了先进经验才能成为杰出的基本建设的工人；更因为基本建设中大部分工程的手工业操作方法和个体劳动组织存在着惊人的生产潜力。东北总工会建筑工会工作委员会副主任王孟忠说：“手工业操作方法和个体劳动组织，反映在工程上就是效率低，但正是效率低也反映出潜力大。因此，土木建筑中一个操作的改进，一件新工具的出现，一个劳动组织的改善，一种先进经验的推广，劳动生产率就会大大的提高。
    大会代表，天津市建筑工人傅鸿宾创造铺灰器的故事证明了这一点。
    一九五一年春天，傅鸿宾从北京前中国建筑公司第一期技工训练班学习结束回到天津后，接受了一个小组长的职务。这个小组是一个被人遗弃的小组，工作效率低，团结不好，谁也不愿意当这个小组的组长。
    傅鸿宾来了。他首先发现这三十多个工人虽然有缺点，但基本上是好的。问题在于组长如何从政治上，从技术上把小组领导起来。傅鸿宾以工人阶级和青年人的热情，开朗的胸怀和带头干的劲儿，首先在政治上把小组带动起来。可是技术上呢？提高工作效率还要靠技术上的保证呵！
    看一看那些工人们吧：和灰，弯一次腰，拿砖，再弯一次腰，拌灰，又弯一次腰，到打上灰条往墙上砌时，还得弯几次腰。真是垒一块砖，磕六、七次头，砌了一天砖才六、七百块，早就腰酸背痛，满身大汗。你能说他们松懈吗？你能要求他们还要加强劳动强度来提高工作效率吗？显然，这是不行的。
    傅鸿宾想了很久，最后就从这垒一块砖，磕六、七个头里找到窍门。如果瓦工专管砌砖不管铺灰就好了，站直着身子，一股劲儿地干下去，那有多快呵！傅鸿宾和组里的工人们摸索研究，并得到工程师的帮助，经过三十多次改进，发明了铺灰器。
    这样，就把瓦工从垒一块砖，磕六、七个头的旧的操作方法中解放出来。
    这个铺灰器，使砌砖中的一部分工作从手工操作提高一步，工人们称它为“拖拉机”。傅鸿宾小组普遍采用铺灰器砌砖，又学习苏长有砌砖法，分段连续砌砖，改变了过去几千年来的个体作业。这样工作效率比旧法砌砖提高百分之三百以上，而且灰铺得匀，质量好，劳动强度反而减轻了。
            ×　×　×
    祖国的一支强大的基本建设队伍已经成长起来，他们的勤劳和智慧使他们享有崇高的荣誉。基本建设工会工作者的任务就在于不断加强政治工作，提高工人的阶级觉悟，加强劳动纪律，关心工人生活，总结和推广先进经验，使这个将不断扩大的基本建设队伍继续巩固和强大起来，为祖国的工业化和过渡到社会主义而奋斗！
