Why Old China Could Not Achieve National Industrialization
Wang Jingyu
    Our country has now begun large-scale, planned economic construction. The general goal of economic construction is to gradually transform China from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country, that is, to industrialize China. Industrialization is the ideal that the Chinese people have dreamed of for a hundred years. The rulers of old China, from the Manchu Qing government to the Kuomintang reactionaries, once ran some industries, but they did not put China on the road to industrialization. The national bourgeoisie of old China also had the subjective desire for industrialization, but these desires ultimately failed. In 1945, Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Coalition Government": "Generally speaking, it is impossible to develop industry without an independent, free, democratic and unified China." He then said: "The history of 105 years since the Opium War in 1840, especially the 18 years since the Kuomintang came to power, has clearly told the Chinese people this point." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III, page 1104) Chairman Mao's instructions have played a great educational role for those who once fantasized about implementing industrialization in old China. In order to correctly understand Chairman Mao's instructions, we need to review history.
    As early as the 1860s, a group of so-called Westernization派 officials in the Manchu Qing government established new-style factories, such as "gunpowder bureaus" and "arsenals." Their purpose was to produce military weapons to suppress the people's revolutionary movement at that time. After the 1880s, government-run industries gradually expanded to some profitable civilian industries. At the same time, they plundered and occupied the newly budding private industries.
    In the budding period of China's new-style industry, the cotton textile industry was the first to have large-scale enterprises that could generate profits. In order to seize such enterprises, the Westernization派 implemented "official supervision and merchant management" or "official-merchant joint management." For example, the Shanghai Weaving Bureau, which started operations in 1890, was originally purely merchant-managed. After submitting a request to Li Hongzhang for approval, it was turned into "official supervision and merchant management." The so-called official supervision meant that the government seized the management power of the entire factory with an investment of less than half of the merchant shares. The Hubei Weaving Bureau, which started operations in 1892, was originally purely government-run. Later, due to insufficient capital, it had to implement "official-merchant joint management," but the merchant shares could not only not participate in the management of the factory, but even the capital was transferred by Zhang Zhidong to run the Hubei Iron Administration Bureau and the Arsenal, and there was no news for many years. In 1893, the Shanghai Weaving Bureau was burned down. Li Hongzhang saw that the yarn profit was very high, so he immediately set up another yarn factory, named "Huacheng Textile General Factory." He forcibly took the three purely merchant-managed yarn factories, Yujin, Dachun, and Yuyuan, as Huacheng's "branch factories." This was also called "official supervision and merchant management." The so-called official supervision meant interfering with the business of the branch factories and forcing the branch factories to donate one tael of silver for each bale of yarn produced. This was the situation in the budding period of the new industry. As of 1895, China had a total of more than 174,000 spindles, and not a single spindle could escape the clutches of the "official" [1].
    China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 thoroughly exposed the bankruptcy of the Westernization派's "New Deal." The failure of the Westernization派 in controlling industry gave capitalism in its budding state an opportunity to oppose "government-run" industries in order to seek its own development. The leaders of the Reform Movement, reformists Kang Youwei and Hu Yufen, represented budding capitalism and demanded that the Manchu Qing government "allow the provinces to widely open private factories and order the people to seek their own development"; and Zai Tian, who supported the Reform, also ordered the provinces to "recruit merchants to set up more weaving and silk weaving bureaus and widely manufacture." China's private industry officially gained legal recognition. However, at that time, it was no longer possible to open up an independent path for capitalist development. Because at this time, world capitalism had developed to the stage of imperialism, and China was not only a commodity market for capitalist countries, but also a place for these countries to export capital. From 1895 to 1914, in just twenty years, the direct investment of countries such as Britain, Russia, the United States, Japan, Germany, and France in China's industry, mining, transportation, and other aspects reached 1,070 million US dollars [2]. During this period, China newly built 9,700 kilometers of railways, of which 3,900 kilometers were in the hands of imperialists, and the rest were also controlled by imperialists due to loan relations [3]. Coal production reached 12.8 million tons, but 5.1 million tons were in the hands of imperialists, and the rest were mostly inseparable from imperialist relations [4]. The power generation in Shanghai alone was 37,000 kilowatts, and two foreign power plants accounted for 27,000 kilowatts [5]. Shanghai had more than 488,000 spindles, and 339,000 belonged to eight foreign yarn factories [6]. All of this shows that in the past twenty years, the powerful capital of imperialism has become the main force oppressing China's national industry. This is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, China's feudal bureaucratic regime made further compromises and collusions with imperialism, and at this time, the relationship between private industry and feudal bureaucrats and compradores was very close; more than half of the capital of private industry came from the property of landlords and bureaucrats, and many of the people who founded factories were themselves officials, merchants, and compradores close to the great feudal bureaucrats [7]. They lacked the strength to resist imperialist aggression politically and economically, and they were weak and powerless in resisting imperialist economic aggression. What was shown in China's industry in the past twenty years was not the development of national capitalism, but the deepening of colonial nature.
    After the outbreak of World War I, imperialist countries (except Japan and the United States) temporarily relaxed their economic aggression against China, and China's national industry achieved some development, especially in the light industry sector, which expanded relatively rapidly. For example, the number of yarn factories increased by 54 from 1914 to 1922 [8]; the number of flour mills increased by 117 from 1912 to 1921 [9]. However, the economic aggression of Japan and the United States intensified even more, seizing the markets of other countries in China. Especially Japan, it launched a large-scale capital export from Northeast China to South China, backed by a political offensive. In addition to directly investing in industry, it also adopted the method of loans and joint ventures to wedge into China's national industry. In the four years from 1916 to 1919 alone, there were eleven Sino-Japanese joint venture coal mines [10]. In the two years from 1917 to 1918, its capital in so-called "joint ventures" increased by 30 million yuan [11]. After the end of the war, all imperialist countries quickly resumed their economic aggression against China. This was most evident in the cotton textile industry. Especially Japanese imperialism, it newly established six textile companies in Shanghai and three companies in Qingdao in the two years from 1921 to 1922. In addition, it added five yarn factories and one cloth factory to the existing textile companies [12]. In contrast to this situation, among the Chinese yarn factories, four factories were annexed by Japanese merchants, two factories were annexed by American merchants, three factories were leased and sold, and eight factories were liquidated and reorganized [13]. The entire national industry rapidly declined.
    In the general situation of the decline of national industry, the national bourgeoisie once again felt the pain of imperialist oppression. It participated in the first domestic revolutionary war; but then withdrew from the revolution and sided with the big bourgeoisie who betrayed the revolution. They fantasized about relying on the Kuomintang to support their industry. Later, due to the expansion of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, which endangered their survival, they fantasized about preserving themselves by developing "private" and "state-owned" cooperation. However, all these fantasies were shattered. The problem was that after the national bourgeoisie sided with the Kuomintang, the feudal shackles were not lifted but intensified, and the oppression of imperialism was not reduced but deepened. During the period from 1914 to 1931, the direct investment of imperialism in China's industry, mining, transportation, and other aspects increased from 1,070 million US dollars to 2,490 million US dollars, almost doubling [14]. In 1931, Japan occupied Northeast China, and the economy of Northeast China was completely colonialized. The degree of colonialization of the inland economy also became more and more serious day by day. The following table is a comparison of imperialist capital and national capital in ten important industrial and mining products in 1933:

Product	Unit	Chinese Capital	Foreign Capital	Percentage of Foreign Capital to Chinese Capital
Electricity	Million kWh	531	891	168
Coal	Thousand tons	11,494	7,309	64
Iron	Thousand tons	127	600	472
Foundry	Thousand yuan	891	1,067	119
Shipbuilding	Thousand yuan	3,804	3,530	93
Cotton yarn	Thousand bales	1,617	656	41
Cotton cloth	Thousand bolts	9,040	14,425	160
Cigarettes	Thousand cases	518	685	132
Matches	Thousand cases	666	69	10
Soap	Thousand yuan	7,046	3,835	54

    Coal and Iron: "Mining Chronicle" (Fifth), pages 39 and 181, including joint ventures and those controlled by foreign capital due to loans.

    Cigarettes and Matches: "Sales Statistics of Unified Tax Items", 1933.
    Foundry, Shipbuilding, and Soap: "National Income of China", Volume 2, pages 35, 49, and 77.

    From this, we can see that in many industrial and mining sectors, the power of foreign capital greatly exceeded that of national capital. Moreover, the production of foreign-owned factories in China was of relatively high quality. If the figures in the table were all calculated based on output value, the proportion occupied by foreign capital would be even higher. At the same time, the production of foreign factories was also large-scale production with a monopolistic nature. For example, the power generation of the American Shanghai Electric Power Company was equivalent to the total power generation of all Chinese factories in the country [15]. The output of the British Ewo Tobacco Company exceeded the output of all Chinese factories [16]. The production of the British China Soap Company accounted for half of the output of Chinese factories [17]. These facts must be taken into account in order to fully understand the degree of oppression of foreign capital on national industry. The Kuomintang government, which "surrendered to imperialism externally and replaced old warlords with new warlords," did not provide any protection for national industry. On the contrary, it heavily destroyed national capital through taxation and other means (such as the unified tax rate on cigarettes, which increased from 22.5% to 50% between 1928 and 1931) [18] and protected foreign capital (such as the unified tax on cotton yarn, where foreign factories bore a lighter burden than Chinese factories) [19]. If we take the period from 1927 to 1937 as a stage, to explain whether national industry was prosperous or bankrupt during this stage, then it is only necessary to compare this stage with the previous stage, and the matter will be very clear. Because in the most depressed period of the previous stage, yarn factories suspended operations with 400,000 spindles [20], while in the latter stage, the number of spindles suspended operations once reached more than 1.59 million [21]. Before 1927, there were 182 Chinese cigarette factories concentrated in Jiangsu Province [22], but by 1932, this had been reduced to 60 [23]. "In the past nine years, they abandoned their ally, the working class, and made friends with the landlord and comprador class. Have they gained any benefits? No, all they have gained is the bankruptcy or semi-bankruptcy of national industrial and commercial enterprises." ("On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume I, page 142) In semi-colonial China, anyone who has had the idea and practice of relying on the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie to develop Chinese industry should learn a lesson from Chairman Mao's summary of this period of history.
    After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of the industrial areas in northern and southeastern China were occupied by Japanese imperialism and became its colonies. Japanese imperialism carried out cruel plunder in this vast colony. It monopolized 63% of North China's coal production and 55% of North China's coal capital (1943) [24], 62% of North China's industrial production and 61% of North China's industrial capital (1942) [25]. It nominally treated the remaining small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises as "Sino"-Japanese joint ventures, but in reality, it made "Chinese" capital subject to Japanese capital control. Some unconscionable capitalists openly cooperated with Japanese imperialism in the colonies, vainly trying to obtain 49% or 51% of the investment in joint ventures. Although industries in the colonial areas that were appendages of the suzerain state had some development, industries that were "incompatible" with the suzerain state were prohibited from expanding.
    In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the entire period of the War of Resistance Against Japan was an era of the development, expansion, and even monopoly of the entire rear industry by bureaucratic capital. The extension of the tentacles of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital into industry began simultaneously with the Kuomintang's bloody rule. Before the War of Resistance, its power had not yet had time to expand rapidly. As of 1935, the proportion of bureaucratic capital in the national industry reached more than 10% [26]. After the War of Resistance, bureaucratic capital expanded rapidly, causing drastic changes in the face of the rear industry. With the Kuomintang's Resources Committee as the center, bureaucratic capital monopolized important industrial and mining sectors such as coal, iron, electricity, machinery, chemicals, and non-ferrous metals. The proportion of bureaucratic capital in the rear industry, only the factories operated and invested by the Kuomintang central organs, provincial and county-level governments, various war zone institutions, and the Four Banks, rapidly rose to 70%, of which the machinery manufacturing industry was as high as 73%, the chemical industry was as high as 75%, the electricity and electrical equipment industry was as high as 89%, and the smelting industry was as high as 90% (1942) [27]. The production of gasoline, kerosene, and non-ferrous metals such as tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, copper, and zinc was completely monopolized by bureaucratic capital [28]. After the victory of the War of Resistance, all Japanese and puppet industrial and mining enterprises were seized by the Kuomintang, and the area monopolized by bureaucratic capital was further expanded. In addition to heavy industry, light industries such as cotton textile, silk reeling, sugar making, and paper making also infiltrated huge bureaucratic capital. Taking the cotton textile industry as an example, the Kuomintang's China Textile Company alone occupied 49% of the nation's spindles, 68% of the looms, 39% of the cotton yarn production, and 74% of the cotton cloth production in 1946 [29]. The rapid expansion of bureaucratic capital during this period can be clearly seen from the increase in the output controlled by bureaucratic capital in the following ten important industrial and mining products. (In the table, the figures for 1941 only include enterprises under the Kuomintang's Resources Committee system, and the figures for 1946 only include enterprises under the Resources Committee and China Textile Company system.)

    Compiled by the Resources Committee of the Kuomintang, "Production of Main Products of Affiliated Enterprises Over the Years".

    It must be pointed out that this huge monopoly of bureaucratic capital in industry was a feudal, comprador, and military industrial monopoly, and it was established on the basis of strangling national capital and strangling the people of the whole country. The Resources Committee, the main institution for the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital to carry out industrial monopoly activities, was initially directly under the Military Committee of the Kuomintang. It had a military nature from the beginning. During the War of Resistance, most of the steel, machinery, electrical equipment, and even non-ferrous metals produced by the industry under the Resources Committee system were to meet the needs of military industry. For example, electrical equipment factories and motor factories mainly assembled military motors and telephones [30], most of the steel plants were sponsored by the Ordnance Department [31], and 90% of aluminum and zinc production was directly controlled by the Ordnance Department [32]. Throughout the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang's budget, under the guise of "construction special funds," used huge amounts of money to engage in munitions production and actively prepared for the civil war [33]. This shows that the Kuomintang's industrial monopoly activities were to consolidate its rule militarily, not to develop China's industry.
    The comprador nature of the Kuomintang's industrial monopoly can be seen from the fact that it has always relied on imperialism and existed as a part of the appendage of imperialism. The source of capital for the Resources Committee was borrowed from American imperialism with rare metal minerals as collateral. The initial establishment of facts, such as steelmaking, oil refining, and electrical equipment, had to seek "cooperation" from Germany, the United States, and even Switzerland [34]. After Japan's surrender, bureaucratic enterprises completely relied on the United States for capital, technology, and even equipment supply, which was no different from the direct investment of American imperialism. Under this circumstance, the production of bureaucratic enterprises only met the needs of imperialism, not the needs of the people. The tungsten and antimony mines mentioned above, which were completely monopolized by bureaucratic capital, were exported to the United States in large quantities every year, while China's needs for tungsten wire and alloy steel had to rely on the United States for supply. This can prove that bureaucratic capital can only turn China into an appendage of imperialism, turn China into "the industrial boundary of the United States," and cannot enable China's industry to achieve independent development.
    The Kuomintang's industrial monopoly was also established on the basis of strangling national capital. On the one hand, bureaucratic capital began to carry out cruel mergers of national industrial capital in its early stages of growth; on the other hand, the Kuomintang adopted a series of unified control measures for private industry, both in production and in transportation and sales, stifling the development of national industry. After excluding national capital to carry out industrial monopoly, the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital itself became very corrupt. Under the management of bureaucrats who only knew how to plunder and exploit, the production capacity of all government-run factories declined day by day. Taking the China Textile Company as an example, the daily yarn production rate of its 38 yarn factories only reached 37% of the standard yarn production rate, which was 57% lower than the average yarn production rate of Chinese yarn factories before the War of Resistance Against Japan [35]. This alone can explain how corrupt bureaucratic capital was.
    In summary, the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital's monopoly in industry could only make the lives of the Chinese people more painful and social productive forces more depressed. It pushed the wheel of Chinese history backward and was a historical reaction.
    This is the cruel reality encountered by the "industrialization" fantasies of many people in China in the past century. The reality of history has proven Chairman Mao's scientific conclusion and educated the Chinese people that only by fundamentally changing the semi-feudal and semi-colonial China into an independent, free, democratic, and unified China can we achieve true industrialization.
    After overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which had been oppressing the Chinese people for a century, we have gained true independence, freedom, democracy, and unity. We have abolished the privileges of imperialism in China, we have confiscated the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital and made it the property of the people, we have completed land reform in the countryside and democratic reform in factories, changed the old relations of production that hinder the development of productive forces, and we have carried out a large amount of material exchange between urban and rural areas, creating a vast domestic market. Therefore, we have the ideal conditions to complete the industrialization of our country. Industrialization first requires the development of heavy industry; it requires the development of our industry at a speed far exceeding that experienced by capitalist countries. The recovery and development of industry in the new China in the past three years has fully demonstrated its superiority. In just three years, many of our basic industries, except for coal, which is only slightly lower than the highest annual output in the past, have exceeded the highest records in Chinese history. The ratio of production of means of production to means of consumption has begun to change. In the past, the proportion of production of means of production in the entire industrial production was very low, but in 1952, the proportion of production of means of production has increased to 43.8%. Labor productivity in industry has also been rapidly developed. In the hands of the Kuomintang, each spindle in the China Textile Company could only produce 0.4 pounds of yarn per day. In the hands of the people, it quickly increased to 1 pound and is still continuing to increase. This is just one example of the rapid increase in labor productivity in the new China. The liberation of productive forces makes it possible for us to quickly accumulate the construction funds we need from domestic sources and from within enterprises. This year, the national economic construction expenditure in the national budget has exceeded twelve times the highest annual "construction" expenditure of the Kuomintang [36]. The income of our state-owned enterprises has increased sevenfold in the past three years and has become the main source of national construction funds. All of this illustrates the powerful strength of the Chinese people after overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and illustrates the invincibility of an independent, free, democratic, and unified China. The industrialization of the motherland is no longer a distant future for us, but a reality that is gradually presenting itself before us. Let us move forward with confidence and effort!

    旧中国为什么不能实现国家工业化
    汪敬虞
    我国目前已经开始大规模的、有计划的经济建设。经济建设的总目标，就是要使中国由落后的农业国逐步变为强大的工业国，就是要使中国工业化。工业化，这是中国人民百年来梦寐以求的理想。旧中国的统治者，从满清政府到国民党反动派曾经举办过一些工业，然而并没有使中国走上工业化的道路。旧中国的民族资产阶级，也曾经有过工业化的主观愿望，然而，这些愿望也终归于失败了。一九四五年毛主席在“论联合政府”中曾经指出：“就整个来说，没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业。”他接着说：“一八四○年鸦片战争以来的一百零五年的历史，特别是国民党当政以来的十八年的历史，清楚地把这个要点告诉了中国人民。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷第一一○四页）毛主席的指示，对于那些曾幻想在旧中国实行工业化的人，曾起过很大的教育作用。为了正确理解毛主席的指示，我们需要温习历史。
    早在十九世纪的六十年代，满清政府就有一批所谓洋务派的官僚创办新式工厂，如“火药局”“枪炮厂”等。他们的目的，是为了生产军火武器，以镇压当时的人民革命运动。八十年代以后，官办工业逐渐扩充到一些有利可图的民用工业，同时对于刚才萌芽的民间自办的工业，进行掠夺和侵占。
    中国新式工业萌芽期，规模较大比较能获利的企业，首推棉纺织业。洋务派为了侵夺这类企业，就实行“官督商办”或“官商合办”。举例说，一八九○年开车的上海织布局，本来是纯粹商办的，经过呈请李鸿章核准，就被变为“官督商办”。所谓官督，就是官方以不足商股二分之一的投资，强夺全厂的管理大权。一八九二年开车的湖北织布局，本来是纯粹官办的。后来因为资本的不足，不得不实行“官商合办”，但商股不独不能参与工厂的管理，并且连资本也被张之洞挪去办了湖北铁政局和枪炮厂，多年没有着落。一八九三年上海织布局被焚，李鸿章眼看纱利极厚，马上又办起一个纱厂来，定名曰“华盛纺织总厂”。硬把纯粹商办的裕晋、大纯、裕源三个纱厂收为华盛的“分厂”。这也叫做“官督商办”，所谓官督，就是干涉分厂的营业，并强令分厂每出纱一包捐银一两。这就是新工业萌芽期的情况。截至一八九五年止，中国共有纱锭十七万四千余枚，没有一个锭是逃得了“官”的魔掌的〔一〕。
    一八九四年中日战争中国的失败，彻底暴露了洋务派“新政”的破产。洋务派把持工业的失败，给萌芽状态中的资本主义有机会反对“官办”工业，以求自己的发展。维新运动的首领改良主义者康有为、胡燏棻代表了萌芽的资本主义，要求满清政府“准各省广开民厂，令民间自为讲求”；而支持变法的载湉，也就谕令各省“招商多设织布纺绸等局，广为制造”。中国的民间工业正式获得法律上的承认。但当时开辟资本主义独立发展的道路已经不可能了。因为此时世界资本主义已经发展到帝国主义阶段，中国已不仅是资本主义国家的商品市场，而且是这些国家输出资本的场所。从一八九五到一九一四年的短短二十年中，英、俄、美、日、德、法等国在中国工矿交通等方面的直接投资，就达到十万万七千万美元〔二〕。这一段时期中国新修了九千七百公里的铁路，其中有三千九百公里在帝国主义者手中，其余的则因借款关系也受到帝国主义者的控制〔三〕。煤产量达到一千二百八十万吨，但有五百一十万吨在帝国主义者手中，其余也多半脱离不了帝国主义者的关系〔四〕。上海一地的发电量，计三万七千瓩，有两个外国电厂便占去二万七千瓩〔五〕。上海纱锭计四十八万八千余枚，而属于外国八个纱厂的就达三十三万九千枚〔六〕。这一切说明了二十年间，帝国主义的强大资本已经成为压迫中国民族工业的主要力量。这是事情的一方面。另一方面，中国的封建官僚政权又和帝国主义作了进一步的妥协与勾结，而此时的民间工业，和封建官僚、买办的关系，非常密切；民间工业资本，有一半以上来自地主、官僚财产，许多创办工厂的人，本身就是接近大封建官僚的官吏、商人、买办〔七〕。他们缺乏在政治上和经济上对抗帝国主义侵略的力量，他们在反抗帝国主义经济侵略上表现得软弱无力。二十年间，在中国工业上所表现的，不是民族资本主义的发展，而是殖民地性质的加深。
    第一次世界大战爆发以后，帝国主义国家（除了日本、美国以外）暂时放松了对中国的经济侵略，中国的民族工业获得了一些发展，特别在轻工业方面，有比较迅速的扩充。如纱厂在一九一四至一九二二年间，增加了五十四家〔八〕；面粉厂在一九一二至一九二一年间，增加了一百一十七家〔九〕。但日本和美国的经济侵略，却更乘机加紧进行，互相抢夺其他国家在中国的市场。特别是日本，它以政治上的攻势为后盾，从东北到华南，展开了大规模的资本输出。除开直接投资于工业以外，还采取借款和合资的方式，楔入中国民族工业。在一九一六至一九一九年的四年中，仅中日合资的煤矿就有十一个单位〔一○〕。在一九一七至一九一八两年中，它在所谓“合办企业”中的资本，就增加了三千万元〔一一〕。战争结束以后，各帝国主义都迅速恢复了对中国的经济侵略。这在棉纺业上表现得最为显著。特别是日本帝国主义，它在一九二一至一九二二两年内，在上海就新设了六个纺织公司，在青岛新设了三个公司，此外，在原有的纺织公司中更增设了五个纱厂和一个布厂〔一二〕。和这种情形相对照的，是在华商纱厂中，有四个厂为日商所兼并，两个厂为美商所兼并，三个厂出租出卖，八个厂清算改组〔一三〕。整个民族工业迅速萧条下来。
    在民族工业普遍萧条的状况下，民族资产阶级再一度感到了帝国主义压迫的痛苦，它参加了第一次国内革命战争；但随即退出了革命，附和了背叛革命的大资产阶级。他们幻想依靠国民党来扶植他们的工业。后来，由于国民党官僚资本的膨胀，危害到他们生存，他们又幻想以“民营”与“国营”的配合发展来保存自己。然而这一切幻想都破灭了。问题在于民族资产阶级附和国民党以后，封建的束缚不是解除而是加紧，帝国主义的压迫不是减少而是加深。从一九一四年到一九三一年这一段时期中，帝国主义在中国的工、矿、交通等方面的直接投资，由十万万七千万美元上升到二十四万万九千万美元，几乎增加了一倍半〔十四〕。一九三一年，日本占领了中国的东北，东北的经济，完全殖民地化了，内地经济殖民地化的程度也一天一天的严重。下表是一九三三年十种重要工矿产品中帝国主义资本和民族资本的对比情况：产品       单位        华资      外资    外资与华资的百分比电力       百万度      531       891     168煤千       吨          11，494   7，309  64铁千       吨          127       600     472翻砂       千元        891       1，067  119造船       千元        3，804    3，530  93棉纱       千包        1，617    656     41棉布       千匹        9，040    14，425 160卷烟       千箱        518       685     132火柴       千箱        666       69      10肥皂       千元        7，046    3，835  54

    从这里我们可以看出，在许多工矿业部门中，外国资本的势力是大大超过民族资本的。而且，外国在华工厂的生产，是质量比较高的产品，表中的数字如果全部以产值计算，外国资本所占的比例还要提高。同时，外国工厂的生产，又是带有垄断性的大规模生产，如美商上海电力公司的发电量，相当全国各华厂发电量的总和〔一五〕，英商颐中烟草公司的产量超过所有华厂的产量〔一六〕，英商中国肥皂公司的生产，占华厂产量的一半〔一七〕，必须考虑到这一些事实，才能充分理解外国资本对民族工业的压迫程度。而“对外投降帝国主义，对内以新军阀代替旧军阀”的国民党政府，对民族工业并没有任何保护，相反，它以税收等方式加重地摧残了民族资本（如卷烟统税率在一九二八年至一九三一年间由百分之二二·五增加到百分之五十）〔一八〕，保护了外国资本（如棉纱统税外厂负担轻于华厂）〔一九〕。如果我们以一九二七至一九三七年作为一个阶段，要说明这一阶段中民族工业是繁荣还是破产，那么只须把这一阶段和前一阶段作一比较，事情就很清楚。因为在前一阶段的最萧条时期，纱厂停工纱锭达到四十万枚〔二○〕，而在后一阶段，停工纱锭则曾经达到一百五十九万多枚。〔二一〕一九二七年以前，中国卷烟厂集中在江苏一省的达到一百八十二家〔二二〕，而至一九三二年则缩减为六十家〔二三〕。“九年以来，他们抛弃了自己的同盟者工人阶级，和地主买办阶级做朋友，得了什么好处没有呢？没有什么好处，得到的只不过是民族工商业的破产或半破产的境遇。”（“论反对日本帝国主义的策略”，“毛泽东选集”第一卷，第一四二页）在半殖民地的中国，一切有过依附官僚买办资产阶级以发展中国工业的想法和做法的人，应该从毛主席这一段历史的总结中得到教训。
    抗战开始以后，中国北部和东南部的工业区，大部被日本帝国主义占领，变成了它的殖民地。日本帝国主义在这一块广大的殖民地上，进行了残酷的掠夺。它独占了百分之六十三的华北煤矿产量和百分之五十五的华北煤矿资本（一九四三年）〔二四〕，百分之六十二的华北工业生产和百分之六十一的华北工业资本（一九四二年）〔二五〕。它把剩余的中小工矿，名义上作为“中”日合资企业，实际上是使“中”资受着日资的控制。一些丧尽天良的资本家，就在殖民地上公开和日本帝国主义合作起来，妄想取得合资企业中百分之四十九或百分之五十一的投资。在殖民地区域作为宗主国附庸的工业，虽然有了一些发展，但是那些和宗主国“相克”的工业，却被禁止扩充。
    在国民党统治区，在整个抗日战争时期，是官僚资本发展、膨胀以至垄断整个后方工业的时代。国民党官僚资本的魔掌之伸入工业，是随着国民党的血腥统治同时开始的。在抗战以前，它的势力还来不及迅速扩充，截至一九三五年止，官僚资本在全国工业中所占的比例，达到百分之十以上〔二六〕。抗战以后，官僚资本迅速膨胀，使后方工业面貌发生了激烈的变更。以国民党的资源委员会为中心，官僚资本垄断了煤、铁、电力、机械、化学以及有色金属等重要工矿部门。官僚资本在大后方工业中所占的比例，仅国民党中央各机关，省、县级政府，各战区机构以及四行所经营及投资的工厂，就迅速上升到百分之七十，其中机器制造工业高至百分之七十三，化学工业高至百分之七十五，电力和电工器材工业高至百分之八十九，冶炼工业高至百分之九十（一九四二年）〔二七〕，汽油、煤油、以及有色金属如钨、锑、锡、汞、铜、锌的生产，完全为官僚资本所独占〔二八〕。抗战胜利以后，日伪工矿企业全部为国民党所攫取，官僚资本所垄断独占的面积更加扩大。除了重工业以外，轻工业中如棉纺织、缫丝、制糖、制纸等部门，也渗入了庞大的官僚资本。以棉纺织业为例，国民党的中纺公司在一九四六年就独占了全国的百分之四十九的纱锭，百分之六十八的布机，百分之三十九的棉纱产量，百分之七十四的棉布产量〔二九〕。官僚资本在这一时期的迅速膨胀，从下列十种重要工矿产品中官僚资本所控制的产量的增长上面，可以很清楚地看出来。（表中数字，一九四一年只包括国民党的资源委员会系统下的企业，一九四六年只包括资源委员会和中纺公司系统下的企业。）

    必须指出，这种庞大的官僚资本在工业上的独占是封建的、买办的、军事的工业独占，是在绞杀民族资本、绞杀全国人民的基础上建立起来的工业独占。作为国民党官僚资本进行工业独占活动的主要机构——资源委员会，最初就是直接隶属在国民党军事委员会的下面。它一开始就带有军事的性质。抗战时期，资源委员会系统下的工业所出产的钢铁、机械、电工器材以至有色金属大多为满足兵工上的需要。例如电工器材厂和电机厂主要装配军用电机和电话机〔三○〕，钢铁厂大部由兵工署主办〔三一〕，铝、锌生产有百分之九十归兵工署直接支配〔三二〕。在整个抗战时期，国民党的预算中，在“建设专款”的掩饰下，以巨大的款项从事军火生产，积极准备内战〔三三〕。这说明国民党进行工业独占活动是为了在军事上巩固它的统治，而不是为了发展中国的工业。
    国民党独占工业的买办性，从它自始就依靠帝国主义，作为帝国主义附庸的一部分而存在的事实上，就可以看出来。资源委员会的资本来源就是以稀有金属矿物为抵押向美帝国主义借来的。其最初创办的事实，如炼钢、炼油以及电工器材等，就不得不求取德国、美国乃至瑞士的“合作”〔三四〕。日本投降以后，官僚企业从资本、技术以至器材供应，都完全以美国为靠山，和美帝国主义的直接投资完全没有两样。在这种情形下，官僚企业的生产，只是满足帝国主义的需要，而不是满足人民的需要。上面提到的被官僚资本所全部独占的钨矿、锑矿，每年都大批输至美国，而中国所需要的钨丝、合金钢，则需仰赖美国供给。这就可以证明官僚资本只能把中国变为帝国主义的附庸，把中国变成“美国的工业边界”，而不能使中国工业得到独立的发展。
    国民党的工业独占，又是在绞杀民族资本的基础上建立起来的。一方面，官僚资本在其成长的初期，就已开始对民族工业资本进行了残酷的兼并；另一方面，国民党对民营工业，无论在生产上，在运销上，都采取了一系列的统制办法，窒息民族工业的发展。在排斥民族资本进行工业独占以后的国民党官僚资本，本身却变得非常糜烂腐败。所有官办工厂，在只知搜刮剥削的官僚们的经营下，生产能力日益减退。以中纺公司为例，它所属的三十八个纱厂，每日产纱率，只达到标准产纱率的百分之三十七，比抗战前华商纱厂的平均产纱率，还要低百分之五十七〔三五〕。只须这一点就可以说明官僚资本是多么腐烂的了。
    总起来说，国民党官僚资本在工业上的独占，只能是使中国人民生活更加痛苦，社会生产力更加衰落，它把中国历史的车轮向后推转，它是历史的反动。    
    这就是中国近百年来许多人“工业化”的空想所遇到的残酷现实。历史的现实证明了毛主席的科学的结论，教育了中国人民，只有根本改变半封建半殖民地的中国为独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，才可能得到真正的工业化。
    在推翻百年来压在中国人民身上的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义以后，我们获得了真正的独立、自由、民主与统一。我们取消了帝国主义在中国的特权，我们没收了国民党官僚资本使之为人民所有，我们完成了农村中的土地改革和工厂中的民主改革，改变了阻碍生产力发展的旧生产关系，我们开展了大量的城乡物资交流，创造了广大的国内市场，由此我们有了完成我国工业化的理想的条件。工业化，这首先要求重工业的发展；要求以大大超过资本主义国家所曾经历的速度来发展我们的工业。新中国工业三年来的恢复和发展已充分表现了它的优越性。仅仅三年时间我国许多基本工业，除了煤只稍低于过去最高年产量之外，其他都已超过了中国历史上的最高纪录。生产资料与消费资料生产量的比例已开始发生变化。过去生产手段的生产在整个工业生产中的比重很低，而一九五二年生产手段生产的比重已增至百分之四十三点八。工业中的劳动生产率也得到迅速的发展，中纺公司在国民党手中，每个锭子每天只能出纱零点四磅，在人民的手中就迅速地提高到一磅，而且还在继续提高，这只是新中国劳动生产率迅速提高的一个例子。生产力的解放，使我们有可能迅速从国内、从企业内部累积我们所需的建设资金。今年国家预算中的国民经济建设支出，已经超过国民党最高一年的“建设”支出的十二倍〔三六〕，我国国营企业的收入，在过去三年中提高了七倍，已经成为国家建设资金的主要来源。这一切，说明了推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义以后中国人民的雄厚力量，说明了独立、自由、民主与统一的中国的不可战胜。祖国的工业化对于我们已经不是遥远的未来，而是逐渐呈现在我们面前的现实。让我们满怀信心，努力前进！
