Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In light of the growing calls from the Japanese people against rearmament, the US government and the Yoshida government have reached an agreement to expand Japan's aggressive forces under the guise of "not rearming."

Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 4th: An agreement reached between the US and Japanese governments regarding Japanese rearmament negotiations stipulates that Japan will continue to expand its "National Security Force" under the guise of "not rearming," with the United States providing "aid" from the "Mutual Security Agency" in exchange. This agreement is the result of recent intensified urging by the US government for the Yoshida government to rearm.

As everyone knows, expanding the Japanese "Security Force" is a central link in the US plan to rearm Japan. Since its establishment, the "Security Force's" organization, equipment, and training have fully demonstrated its nature - the core of the new Japanese army. Recently, when Allison, who succeeded Murphy as the US Ambassador to Japan, arrived in Tokyo last November, the so-called Japanese "self-defense plan" he proposed to the Yoshida government mainly demanded that the Yoshida government increase the "Security Force" from approximately four divisions to ten divisions within two to three years.

    美政府与吉田政府互相勾结
    继续扩充日本“保安队”
    据新华社讯：鉴于日本人民反对重整军备的呼声一天天高涨，美国政府和吉田政府达成了一个关于在“不重整军备”的烟幕之下扩充日本的侵略部队的协议。
    据法新社东京四日电透露：美国和日本政府之间关于日本重整军备的谈判所达成的一项协议，规定日本继续以“不重整军备”为掩盖，进一步扩充它的“国家保安队”，美国以“共同安全署”的“援助”为交换条件。这个协议是美国政府近来加紧督促吉田政府重整军备的结果。
    大家知道，扩充日本“保安队”是美国重新武装日本计划的中心环节。“保安队”自建立以来，它的编制、装备、训练各个方面，已经充分说明它的性质——日本新陆军的核心。最近继墨菲任美国驻日大使的艾利逊在去年十一月到东京时向吉田政府提出的所谓日本“自卫计划”，主要就是要求吉田政府在两三年之内将“保安队”由四个师左右的兵力增加到十个师。
