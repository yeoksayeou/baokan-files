Central South China Architectural Engineering Departments Actively Prepare for Construction
Architectural Area of One Million Square Meters Scheduled to Begin Construction in the Second Quarter

[This newspaper report] The architectural engineering departments and related units in the Central South region are actively preparing for this year's basic construction tasks, with some projects already underway. Preliminary statistics show that 89 construction sites, totaling one million square meters of construction area, have commenced or are ready to commence construction in the second quarter of this year.

This year's basic construction tasks in the Central South region are substantial. The projects undertaken by the engineering companies under the Central South Architectural Engineering Bureau exceed the total workload completed last year by more than double. These include the construction of large-scale projects such as power plants, shipyards, and cotton mills, as well as various university and specialized school projects, and many employee residences and hospitals.

To fulfill the basic construction tasks for the first year of the national Five-Year Plan, the Central South architectural engineering departments have actively carried out various preparatory works. The CPC Central Committee's Central South Bureau has transferred more than 300 cadres to the Central South architectural engineering departments this year, including over 100 cadres at the county level and above. Currently, the Central South Architectural Engineering Bureau system has over 30,000 construction workers and thousands of construction engineers, technicians, and administrative personnel on site. The Central South region also plans to train 5,000 technical cadres this year in areas such as cost accounting, basic record-keeping, estimation, and surveying.

The engineering companies under the Wuhan Municipal Architectural Engineering Bureau have basically prepared steel bars, bricks, and tiles according to plan and are currently negotiating with Huaxin Cement Company to gradually procure cement. Regarding timber, they are also in negotiations with or establishing contracts with the forestry bureaus of Hunan and Guangxi provinces.

The serious problem currently existing in the construction preparation work is that design cannot keep up with construction. For example, the Design Company directly under the Central South Architectural Engineering Bureau has accepted design tasks assigned by the Central Architectural Engineering Ministry for an area of more than 700,000 square meters, but only just over 200,000 square meters have been connected with construction units one by one. The rest cannot be designed either because the construction unit's plan has not yet been approved, or because the plan has changed, or because of a lack of design data, resulting in a situation where construction is waiting for design. At the same time, this has caused one-third to one-half of the design force to be idle. Another reason why construction needs cannot be met is the insufficient estimation capacity. It generally takes more than a month to estimate a drawing, and often the design has been completed, but construction cannot start because it cannot be estimated. In addition, insufficient and untimely material supply, non-compliant material specifications, an imbalance of skill types among technical workers, and poor construction management are all factors affecting the early start of construction. But more importantly, some cadres have a waiting and dependent mentality. Construction units wait for plan approval, and construction units wait for tasks; even if the tasks are determined, both sides become entangled in disputes over labor, materials, and deadlines, haggling and shirking responsibility, causing the contract agreement to be repeatedly delayed and unable to be signed.

### 中南区建筑工程部门积极进行施工准备  第二季度已开工和即将开工的建筑面积达一百万平方公尺

    中南区建筑工程部门积极进行施工准备
    第二季度已开工和即将开工的建筑面积达一百万平方公尺
    【本报讯】中南全区建筑工程部门及有关单位正积极进行今年基本建设任务的准备工作，部分工程已陆续开工。据初步统计，今年第二季度已开工和准备就绪即将开工的有八十九个工地，共计有一百万平方公尺的建筑面积。
    今年中南区的基本建设任务很大，中南建筑工程局所属工程公司承建的工程，就比去年全年所完成的工作量超过一倍以上。其中有建造发电厂、造船厂、棉纺厂等大型工程，有各种大学、专科学校的工程，以及许多职工住宅、医院等。
    为了完成国家五年计划第一年的基本建设任务，中南建筑工程部门积极进行了各项准备工作。中共中央中南局今年调往中南建筑工程部门的干部已有三百余名，其中县级以上的干部有一百多名。目前，中南建筑工程局系统已有三万余建筑工人，数千名建筑工程师、技术员和行政管理人员进入工地。中南今年还准备训练各种技术干部五千名，如成本会计、基层记录、估算、测定等方面人员。
    武汉市建筑工程局所属工程公司已基本上按计划备齐了钢筋、砖瓦，并正和华新水泥公司陆续商订水泥。木材方面，也正在和湖南、广西等省林业局商洽或订立合同中。
    目前施工准备工作中存在的严重问题是设计赶不上施工。如中南建筑工程局直属设计公司接受了中央建筑工程部交来七十多万平方公尺面积的设计任务，然而逐一与建设单位接上头的只有二十余万平方公尺。其余的不是因为建设单位计划尚未批准，就是因为计划变更或缺乏设计资料，无法设计，因而造成施工等待设计的局面，同时造成目前仍有三分之一到二分之一的设计力量窝工的现象。不能满足施工需要的另一原因是估算力量不足。一般图纸要化一个多月的时间进行估算，往往设计已完成，因估算不出而不能开工。另外材料供应不足且不及时，材料规格不合要求，技术工人中工种不平衡，施工管理不善，都是影响目前及早开工的因素。但是更重要的是一些干部有着等待依赖思想。兴建单位等待批准计划，施工单位等待任务；任务即使确定了，双方又纠缠在工料、工期等争议中，讨价还价，互相推诿，使得合同协议一再拖延不能签订。
