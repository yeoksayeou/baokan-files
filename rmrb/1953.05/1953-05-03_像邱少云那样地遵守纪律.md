    Observe Discipline Like Qiu Shaoyun
    Ma Tieding
    We still know very little about Qiu Shaoyun's life story. What has spread like the wind across the country is just the moment before his sacrifice. But what a great moment this is! How much spiritual wealth it has left us!

    At this moment, I particularly think of Qiu Shaoyun's spirit of observing discipline.

    Before Qiu Shaoyun and his comrades were ordered to lie in ambush near the enemy's position, the unit leader had told them:

    "For this ambush, you must rely on clever disguise, on calmness, and more importantly, on observing ambush discipline. Even if someone is hit by enemy bullets, they must not reveal their target."

    Here, the ambush discipline was announced. And discipline, of course, is a kind of constraint on everyone. However, for our soldiers who are highly concerned about the overall interests, this constraint is the most pleasant and free code of conduct. As we often say, our discipline is based on consciousness, that is, the consciousness of individual interests obeying overall interests, and the consciousness of sacrificing the individual for the sake of the whole when necessary.

    The great soldier Qiu Shaoyun was just like this:

    The incendiary bombs fired by the enemy ignited the weeds around him. At this time, he could have completely stood up to put out the flames on his body, but he did not move; the flames kept burning to his head, he really wanted to rush up and fight the enemy not far in front, but he still did not move; when the flames were about to destroy his life, he suddenly raised his head and said in a weak voice to his comrade Li Shihuli, who was closest to him:

    "Victory is ours, but I can't complete the demolition mission. I'll leave this mission to you to complete!"

    Until the time of his sacrifice, he still did not move. And what was he thinking at that moment? It was the demolition mission, the overall situation, and the victory of the battle. Obviously, Qiu Shaoyun's observance of discipline was not for anything else, but truly based on consciousness.

    This shows that Qiu Shaoyun is not only a brilliant model for us in many other aspects of moral character, but also in observing discipline.

    Let us all observe the discipline of the Party, the state, the army, and people's organizations like Qiu Shaoyun!

### 像邱少云那样地遵守纪律

    像邱少云那样地遵守纪律
  　马铁丁
    关于邱少云的生平事迹，我们知道的还是非常少。像风一般传遍祖国的，只是他牺牲前的一瞬间的事情。但，这是伟大的一瞬间，这一瞬间，给我们留下多少精神的财富呵！
    此刻，我特别地想起邱少云的遵守纪律的精神。
    在邱少云和他的战友们奉命到离敌人阵地很近的地方去潜伏以前，部队首长曾对他们说：
    “你们这次去潜伏，要靠巧妙的伪装，要靠沉着，更重要的是要遵守潜伏纪律。那怕有人被敌人子弹打中了，也不能暴露目标。”
    这里，宣布了潜伏纪律。而纪律，当然是对大家的一种约束。但是，这种约束，对于我们高度关切整体利益的战士说来，乃是最愉快而自由的生活规范。如同我们常说的那样，我们的纪律是建立在自觉的基础上的，那就是个人利益服从整体利益的自觉，就是于必要时为了整体，牺牲个人的自觉。
    伟大的战士邱少云正是这样：
    敌人发射的燃烧弹烧着他身边的野草，这时，他要站起来是完全可以扑灭身上的火苗的，可是他没有动；火焰一直烧到他的头上，他很想冲上去跟前面不远的敌人拚了，可是他还没有动；火焰要毁灭他的生命了，他才猛地抬起头来，用微弱的声音向离他最近的战友李士虎说：
    “胜利是我们的，但是我不能完成爆破任务了，这个任务交给你去完成吧！”
    一直到牺牲时，他还是一动也没动。而这一瞬间，他想的是什么呢？是爆破的任务，是整体，是战斗的胜利。很明显，邱少云的遵守纪律，完全不是为了别的，而是真正地建立在自觉的基础上的。
    这就表明：邱少云不仅在道德品质上的许多别的方面，而且在遵守纪律这一点上，都足为我们的光辉的楷模。
    让我们都像邱少云那样地遵守党和国家、军队和人民团体的纪律吧！
