The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government Strengthen Leadership Over Suburban Work
Clearly Stipulating that the Central Task of the Suburban Districts is Agricultural Production

Tangshan City is an industrial city. The suburbs originally had 147 villages. In May 1952, 194 villages were划进 from Tangshan Special District. Now there are a total of 341 villages, including 143,173 households of purely agricultural and semi-agricultural/semi-industrial workers. In June of last year, the "Tangshan Municipal Suburban Work Committee" was established (now the Suburban Work Committee has been abolished, and the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau has been established). After half a year of work, although certain achievements have been made, there are still many serious problems in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. There are many reasons why rural work in Tangshan City has not been done well. The most important ones are:

I. Inconsistent leadership thinking, unclear tasks of the Suburban Committee, and unfocused cadre strength.

Although the Suburban Work Committee was established last year and an office was set up, because Tangshan City is an industrial city, leaders at all levels initially showed a lack of understanding of rural work to varying degrees, their strength was scattered, and the Suburban Committee did not play its due role.

	1. Most of the members of the Suburban Committee were nominal members. A total of two meetings were held last year, with only one-third of the members attending. Many members attended, but did not speak because they did not understand the situation. Although Tangshan City also established an agricultural increase production competition committee, no meeting has been held since the announcement of its establishment, no one has managed this work, and even the "framework" has not been set up.

	2. Last year, the municipal and district leadership lacked a clear understanding of what work the suburbs should focus on. When the municipal-level agencies, groups, and departments assigned work downward, they only emphasized how important their own work was, and moved the set of working methods in the urban area to the countryside, without mentioning agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

	3. There were also problems in the allocation of cadres. Some district agricultural construction shares only had two cadres. The Suburban Committee office only had a staffing of fifteen cadres, which was not only more than half less than the agricultural cadres of a third-class county, but also of poor quality.

	4. In the use of cadres, the serious phenomenon of scattered strength and non-specialized full-time work was even more prominent. The cadres of the agricultural construction shares in each district not only had to undertake both agricultural and construction work, but many became "mobile cadres," who were often assigned to do other work, and rarely did, or even did not do, agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation work. Of the fifteen cadres in the Suburban Committee office (actually only thirteen cadres including the document clerk), nine main cadres were transferred to work on party rectification, exhibitions, etc. from October to December of last year, leaving only three or four people in the office. Therefore, major tasks such as winter production and the consolidation of mutual aid groups in 1952 were not done at all, and the office did not grasp any basic and reliable figures for the suburbs.

	5. The Suburban Committee office was under the dual leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, but the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government did not provide timely leadership to the Suburban Committee. In September of last year, the Suburban Committee office sent the five-year plan to the Municipal Government office. It took twenty-one days and three requests to get it back, and no opinions were put forward. The office rewrote the work plan for 1953 and the work plan for the fourth quarter of 1952 a total of three times. Finally, the municipal-level leaders revised it and said: "It will be issued soon"; but it was not issued until April of this year. The thinking of the municipal-level leaders was also not consistent enough. At one time last year, the director of the Suburban Committee office had to go when the Municipal Government held meetings; but the comrades of the Municipal Party Committee said: "It has nothing to do with your work, you can ask for leave." In reality, leave was often not approved, which put the comrades of the Suburban Committee office in a dilemma. When the abolition of the Suburban Committee and the establishment of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau were announced, the official seal of the office was not issued, and what the cadres should do was not specified. There was no director of the bureau, and it was not announced who would act as an agent. The comrades of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau urged the Municipal Government office and the Personnel Department many times. It took nearly two months before the notice of the official seal of the office and the responsibilities of the personnel were issued, and it took many more days before the director of the bureau was sent. This also caused great losses to the work.

II. The Suburban Committee itself also had some problems.

The leading cadres of the former Suburban Committee office had a serious bureaucratic style. They didn't have a clear picture, grabbed at random, and were passive in their work. When tasks came, they always blocked them, and sometimes handed the tasks directly to the staff without going through meetings or section chiefs. They never summarized a piece of work well to improve the cadres and promote the work.

No leading cadre delved into professional work and studied deeply. When approving documents, they rarely wrote how to do it, but simply signed their names or "Handed over to a certain section," leaving the lower levels at a loss as to how to do it. They also rarely adopted rationalization proposals put forward by lower levels.

The phenomenon of cadres below the section chief of the Suburban Committee being irresponsible for their work was also very serious. Some section chiefs knew that the suburban work was not improving, but did not offer opinions to the higher levels, nor did they study the documents well, and had only a superficial understanding of the policies. In February of this year, when testing the mutual aid and cooperation policy and agricultural technology, seven of the twelve district committee secretaries and district heads failed. Some cadres shouted: "I don't know how to do this work." But they did not study the documents well, nor did they delve into learning from the masses.

The Suburban Committee assigned more work to the lower levels, but inspected less. There was more work, less personnel, more problems, and less summaries. Therefore, some unnecessary losses were caused in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and production.

In mutual aid organizations, there is a widespread phenomenon of blindly accumulating public property. Yu Wenbin, a labor model in the tenth district, said at the conference: "Our group has completely brought livestock, vehicles, grass, pigs, etc. into the group." Many mutual aid groups are bringing all livestock into the group at a discounted price. Some groups have also brought sewing machines and sock knitting machines into the group at a discounted price, and plan to "centrally manage and distribute" in the group. The phenomenon of infringing on the interests of middle peasants is also very serious. When Xu Ding's mutual aid group in Dafenggezhuang, the third district, apportioned money to buy livestock, they apportioned more to the middle peasants. Some cadres asked Xu Ding: "If this is the case, will the middle peasants not suffer?" Xu Ding said: "If the middle peasants don't suffer a little, will the poor peasants suffer?" Liu Wanheng, a labor model in the fifth district, said: "If there is a middle peasant in the group, the poor peasants will suffer." Huayan Xinzhuang in the eighth district excluded more than forty middle peasant households from the group.

Many mutual aid groups have impure compositions. There is a person under surveillance in a group in Louzizhuang, the ninth district, and a Yiguandao altar leader in the Wang Minzhong cooperative; there are also many landlords and rich peasants participating. In Hu Shao Shen's group in Dafotou Village, the tenth district, there are group members who hire long-term workers to join the group.

There are many problems in agricultural production cooperatives. The Xiong Songshan cooperative owes more than 13 million yuan to the bank, and the contract period has long expired, and there is no money to repay. Some cooperatives have been established for four or five months, and there has been no work evaluation, which affects labor morale.

Last winter's production was all spontaneously developed due to lack of leadership. Some groups bought oil pressing tools, but could not start work due to high costs, and accumulated more than 3 million yuan in funds; some groups blindly pressed oil but could not sell it; some nominally engaged in sideline production but actually engaged in commercial activities; some attempted to use the name of the mutual aid group to fraudulently obtain loans for business. Many people are not at ease with agricultural production and want to abandon farming and work.

The Tangshan Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau has not yet figured out how many agricultural laborers and how many mutual aid groups there are in the suburbs of Tangshan City. But the "plan" for 1953 has already been drawn up.

In order to thoroughly solve these problems, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tangshan Municipal People's Government convened two expanded cadre meetings on February 5th and March 6th and 7th, attended by responsible cadres from relevant municipal departments, district committee secretaries, district heads, agricultural cadres, and labor model representatives from various suburban districts. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government put forward improvement measures, and after discussion and resolution by the meeting, the following measures were taken:

(I) Unify thinking and determine tasks:

	1. Agricultural production is the overriding central task in the suburbs, and all departments in the suburbs should complete their own tasks after completing the central task. Establish unified leadership organizations for production at the municipal, district, and village levels, with cadres who truly play a role participating. The district committee secretary or deputy secretary should be responsible for leading agricultural work. The Patriotic Increase Production Competition Committee was established, and an office was set up. When it rained in early March, this office immediately notified all districts to report on the rainfall and arranged for spring plowing and soil moisture conservation. At the regular meeting in early April, each member reported on the work of each department related to the suburbs in order to arrange it in a unified manner. The state of last year's virtual committee that did not play a role has been basically overcome.

	2. All rural work cadres must delve into mutual aid and cooperation and learn general agricultural technology.

	3. The Municipal Party Committee will uniformly arrange various work throughout the year. In the past, each department worked independently and conflicted with each other; this time, the work of the district and village was arranged well, and it was stipulated that any work must not hinder production, and must be carried out in conjunction with production.

	4. Strengthen agricultural production cadres, adjust institutions and zoning, so that suburban cadres can concentrate their efforts to lead agricultural production.

	5. The Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau will set up a Mutual Aid and Cooperation Section, and the districts will set up Mutual Aid and Cooperation Guidance Stations to hold regular meetings and exchange and summarize experience.

(II) Improve the leadership of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau: In addition to improving the institutions of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, it was decided that the Rural Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee and the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau would work together to strengthen political leadership. Combining the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion and commandism, and violations of law and discipline, find out the main problems of the former Suburban Committee office, improve working methods, re-draw up plans, strengthen cadre study, conscientiously implement democratic style, and promote the working style of "delving in, delving to the end," so as to make the work planned and strengthen supervision and inspection, in order to overcome the floating and chaotic phenomena of the work.

    中共唐山市委、市人民政府加强对郊区工作的领导
    明确规定市郊区的中心工作是农业生产
    唐山市是工业城市，郊区原有一四七个村，一九五二年五月又由唐山专区划进一九四个村，现共有三四一个村，包括纯农业户及半工半农户一四三、一七三户。去年六月成立了“唐山市郊区工作委员会”（现在郊区工作委员会已撤销，成立了农林局）。经过半年工作，虽有一定成绩，但在农业生产、互助合作运动中，至今仍有很多严重问题。唐山市农村工作没有搞好的原因很多，最主要的有以下几个：
    一、领导思想不一致，郊委任务不明确，干部力量不集中。
    去年虽然成立了郊区工作委员会，并设立了办公室，但因为唐山市是工业城市，各级领导干部最初或多或少地都有对农村工作认识不足的表现，力量分散，郊委会未起到应有的作用。
    1、郊委会委员多是挂名委员，去年共开过两次会，到会人数仅有三分之一，很多委员虽然出席了，但因为不了解情况，也不发言。唐山市虽然也成立了农业增产竞赛委员会，但宣布成立后，一次会也没开过，也没人管这个工作，连“架子”都没搭起来。
    2、去年市、区领导方面对于郊区究竟以什么工作为中心缺乏明确的认识。市级各机关、团体、部门往下布置工作时，都只是强调自己的工作如何重要，并将市区的一套工作方法搬到农村里，而对农业生产和互助合作运动只字不提。
    3、在干部配备上也有问题。有的区农业建设股只有两名干部。郊委办公室仅有十五名干部的编制，不但比一个三等县的农业干部少一半多，而且质量也很差。
    4、在干部使用上，更突出地表现出了力量分散、专职不专用的严重现象。各区的农业建设股的干部不但要担任农业、建设两项工作，很多变成了“机动干部”，经常被分配去做其他工作，很少作或根本未作农业生产及互助合作方面的工作。在郊委会办公室的十五名干部（实际工作的连文书收发在内只有十三名干部），从去年十月到十二月，为整党、办展览会等工作被调去九名主要干部，机关内经常只剩三、四个人，因此，一九五二年的冬季生产、整顿互助组等重大工作根本未做，办公室对郊区任何基本可靠数字都掌握不住。
    5、郊委办公室受市委、市政府双重领导，可是市委、市政府对郊委会的领导都不及时。在去年九月，郊委办公室把五年计划送到市政府办公室，过了二十一天，要了三次才退回来，也没有提出什么意见。一九五三年的工作计划和一九五二年第四季度工作计划，办公室共改写了三次，最后市级领导同志们修改了，说：“不日即可发下”；但到今年四月也没发下来。市级领导干部思想也不够一致。在去年有一个时期，市府开会时郊委办公室主任必须去；但市委同志说：“与你们工作无关，可以请假不去。”实际上，请假时却又往往不批准，这使郊委办公室的同志们左右为难。当宣布郊委会撤销、成立农林局时，机关钤印未发，那个干部作什么都未规定，既无局长，又未宣布由谁代理。农林局的同志们向市政府办公室和人事处催了很多次，过了将近两个月，机关钤印和人员职责的通知等才发下来，又过了很多日期，才派了局长来。这也使工作受到很大损失。
    二、郊委会本身也有一些问题。
    前郊委办公室领导干部官僚主义作风严重，心中无数，乱抓一把，工作被动，任务一来，总是东挡西堵，有时不通过会议及科长，把工作任务直接交给科员，工作已经作了，科长还不知道。从没有把一件工作很好地总结一下，借以提高干部和推进工作。
    没有一个领导干部钻研业务，深入学习。在批文件时，很少批如何做，只是签上自己的名字或“交某某科”字样，使下级不知怎样去干。下级提出合理化建议，他们也很少采纳。
    郊委科长以下干部对工作不负责任的现象也很严重。有的科长自己知道郊区工作无起色，既不向上级提意见，自己又不很好学习文件，对政策多是一知半解。今年二月间测验互助合作政策和农业技术时，十二个区委书记和区长就有七个人考不及格。有些干部喊：“不知这工作怎样搞。”但并没有很好地学习文件，也没有钻进去向群众学。
    郊委会向下面布置多，检查少，工作多，人员少，问题多，总结少，因而在互助合作运动和生产中招致了一些不应有的损失。
    在互助组织里，普遍地存在着盲目积累公有财产的现象。十区劳动模范于文彬在大会上说：“我们组把牲畜、车辆、草、猪等完全归伙了。”很多互助组是把牲畜全部折价入伙。有些组把缝纫机、织袜子机也折价入了组，并且打算在组里“统筹统支”大搞一通。侵犯中农利益的现象也很严重。三区大冯各庄徐鼎互助组摊钱买牲畜时，让中农多摊。有的干部问徐鼎：“如果这样，中农不吃亏吗？”徐鼎说：“中农不吃点亏，让贫农吃亏吗？”五区劳动模范刘万恒说：“组内一有中农，贫农就要吃亏。”八区华岩新庄把四十多户中农排斥在组外边。
    很多互助组成份不纯。九区楼子庄有一个组内有被管制分子，王敏中合作社中有一贯道坛主；地主、富农参加的也不少。十区大佛头村胡少深组，有组员雇长工入组。
    农业生产合作社问题很多。熊松山社欠银行一千三百多万元，合同期限早过，无钱归还。有的社建立了四、五个月，还没有评工，影响劳动情绪。
    去年冬季生产因无人领导，全是自流发展的。有的组买了榨油工具，因成本高不能开工，积压三百多万元资金；有的组盲目打了油，卖不出去；有的名义上是搞副业，实际是搞商业活动；有的企图借互助组名义骗取贷款作买卖。许多人不安心农业生产，想弃农做工。
    唐山市农林局到现在也没弄清楚唐山市郊区究竟有多少农业劳动力、有多少互助组。可是一九五三年的“计划”居然已经订出来了。
    为了彻底解决这些问题，中共唐山市委和唐山市人民政府在今年二月五日和三月六、七日召开了两次市级各有关部门负责干部、各郊区区委书记、区长、农业干部及劳动模范代表参加的扩大干部会议。市委、市政府提出了改进办法，经会议讨论决议，采取了以下几种措施：
    （一）统一思想，确定任务：
    1、郊区以农业生产为压倒一切的中心工作，郊区各部门应在完成中心工作的情况下完成本部门工作。市、区、村建立有各部门参加的统一领导生产的机构，由真正起作用的干部参加。区委书记或副书记要负责领导农业工作。成立爱国增产竞赛委员会，并设立了办公室。在三月初下雨时，这个办公室马上通知各区汇报下雨情况，布置春耕、保墒工作。在四月初举行例会时，各委员报告各部门有关郊区工作，以便统一安排。去年那种虚设委员会不起作用的状态，基本上克服了。
    2、所有农村工作干部必须钻进去搞互助合作和学普通农业技术。
    3、由市委统一安排全年各种工作。往年各部门工作都是单打一，互相抵触；这次把区村工作安排好，并规定进行任何工作，都必须不妨碍生产，和生产互相结合进行。
    4、加强农业生产干部，调整机构和区划，以利郊区干部集中力量领导农业生产。
    5、市农林局设立互助合作科，区设互助合作指导站，定时开会，交流和总结经验。
    （二）改进农林局的领导：除健全农林局机构外，并决定市委农村工作部和农林局合署办公，加强政治领导。结合反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪斗争，找出前郊委会办公室的主要问题，改进工作方法，重订计划，加强干部学习，认真贯彻民主作风，发扬“钻进去，钻到底”的工作作风，作到工作有计划，加强督促检查，以克服工作漂浮和混乱现象。（于祥）
