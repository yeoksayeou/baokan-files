Column: Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government wrote: The People's Daily published a cartoon on March 29th entitled "It Concerns You, But You Still Ignore It," along with letters from readers Rong Chang and Wen Tao, reflecting that a wagon of printed cloth was burned during railway transportation, and the Tianjin Railway Administration and the Qiqihar Railway Administration were not earnestly responsible for finding the owner of the goods and handling the matter in a timely manner. We believe that the readers' report is accurate. This is not only a shortcoming in the work of the railway administrations, but also an intolerable shortcoming in the entire railway work, which deserves our attention and vigilance. The cloth was shipped from Manzhouli to Tianjin South Station. In December 1951, it arrived between Daqing and Jiangqiao stations under the jurisdiction of the Qiqihar Railway Administration. Due to poor vehicle maintenance and sparks from the locomotive, a fire occurred, and the entire wagon of cloth was burned, causing significant losses to national resources. It has now been ascertained that the consignee was the Tianjin Municipal Company of the China National Department Store.

After an accident occurs, business records should be compiled by the discovering station according to regulations and sent to the destination station with the waybill for delivery to the consignee. However, although the Qiqihar Railway Administration compiled the business records, it did not send them with the waybill as required, but only sent the waybill to the destination station (Tianjin South Station) by registered mail. Tianjin South Station mistakenly thought it was a case of having a ticket but no goods and did not notify the consignee; and the consignee never inquired about the wagon of cloth from the railway. At the same time, Tianjin South Station did not contact the Qiqihar Railway Administration, but reported it to the Ministry of Railways. The Joint Transportation Department of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, after receiving the waybill, also treated it as a case of having a ticket but no goods because it was unaware of the fire, and sent it along with other waybills to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Tianjin Railway Administration for investigation. Of course, the goods had been burned, and no investigation could find them, so the case remained unresolved for a long time.

After the accident occurred, although the Qiqihar Railway Administration reported the case to the Ministry of Railways, the relevant cadres handling the case lacked a serious and responsible spirit towards national resources and a high sense of responsibility. They did not actively address the issue and thoroughly investigate the cause of the fire to pursue responsibility. They simply emphasized railway regulations and waited for the cargo owner to request compensation. This reflects the serious bureaucratic style, unclear division of labor, and buck-passing in our railway work; at the same time, the leadership of the Ministry of Railways lacked inspection of this matter and failed to discover it in time, resulting in a delay of more than a year in resolving it.

This incident is a great lesson for us. In addition to quickly thoroughly investigating responsibility, handling the case to a conclusion, and appropriately dealing with derelict personnel, we must use this as a lesson, combine it with the struggle against bureaucracy and violations of law and discipline, conduct education among all railway employees, deeply examine the bureaucratic errors in our work, and thoroughly change the irresponsible mindset of neglecting national resources.

### 中央人民政府铁道部对花布一车焚烧案的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央人民政府铁道部对花布一车焚烧案的检讨
    中央人民政府铁道部来信：三月二十九日人民日报登载了以“事本关己，仍然挂起”为题的漫画以及读者荣昌、文滔的来信，反映一车花布在铁路运送中烧毁，天津铁路管理局和齐齐哈尔铁路管理局不认真负责查找货主、及时处理这一事件。我们认为读者反映的情况是正确的。这不仅是铁路管理局工作上的缺点，而且是整个铁路工作中的不能容忍的缺点，值得我们重视和警惕。该项花布系由满洲里运往天津南站，于一九五一年十二月间运至齐齐哈尔铁路管理局所属大兴、江桥站间，因车辆整备不良、机车喷出火星而造成火灾事故，一车花布全部烧毁，造成国家资材的重大损失。现已查明收货人为中国百货公司天津市公司。
    事故发生，照章应由发现站编制商务记录，随货物运单寄送到站，由到站转交收货人。但齐齐哈尔铁路管理局虽编制了商务记录，却没有按章随同运单寄送，而只将货物运单以挂号信寄交到站（天津南站）。天津南站误认为是有票无货，未通知收货人；而收货人亦始终未向铁路方面查领该车花布。同时天津南站亦未与齐齐哈尔铁路管理局联系，即报送铁道部。铁道部商务局联运处收到该运单后，因不知有失火案，亦作为有票无货问题处理，与其他运单一并送交政务院财经委员会及天津铁路管理局去清查。当然货已烧掉，再也清查不出来，于是此案就长期不能解决。
    事故发生以后，齐齐哈尔铁路管理局虽曾将此案向铁道部报告，但由于经办这一案件的有关干部缺乏对国家资材严肃负责的精神和高度的责任心，未积极抓紧处理，彻底检查失火原因，追究责任，只是单纯强调铁路规章，等待着货主来请求赔偿。这反映了我们铁路工作中的严重官僚主义作风和分工不明、遇事推诿的情况；同时铁道部领导方面对此事缺乏检查，没能及时发现，致使拖了一年多没有解决。
    这一事件对我们的教训很大。我们除应迅速彻查责任，处理结案，对于失职人员加以适当处理外；并以此为教训，结合反官僚主义、反违法乱纪的斗争，在全体铁路员工中进行教育，深入检查我们工作中的官僚主义错误，彻底改变忽视国家资材的不负责任的思想作风。
