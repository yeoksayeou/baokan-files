Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: The Mazowsze Polish Folk Song and Dance Ensemble of the People's Republic of Poland performed music and dance for the masses of workers in Beijing on the afternoon of the 3rd.

An hour before the performance began, crowds poured into the Xian Nong Tan Stadium from all directions, and the wide square was filled with over 40,000 spectators.

At about 4 o'clock, the performance began. Yan Rong, Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a welcoming speech, expressing sincere gratitude on behalf of the capital's workers to all comrades of the song and dance ensemble headed by Pannufnik. Deputy Head of the Ensemble, Donbarufsky, also spoke at the meeting, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome from the Chinese people.

After representatives of the Beijing workers presented gifts to the song and dance ensemble, the ensemble performed more than 20 choral and dance numbers. The audience welcomed each program with warm applause and cheers. The song and dance ensemble used cheerful melodies to sing of the happy lives of Polish workers and farmers who are marching towards socialism.

Their collective dances depicted ever-changing and beautiful patterns on the stage. The "Mazurka Dance" was especially loved by the audience. The plot of this dance is: a little bird flew away, and the young man chased after her and danced together. Amidst the enthusiastic applause of the audience, the song and dance ensemble re-performed this program. The Palonska folk song "Little Cuckoo" was also re-sung twice at the audience's request.

At the end of the performance, dozens of representatives of Beijing workers went on stage to present flowers to the song and dance ensemble and the accompanying orchestra, expressing their heartfelt gratitude.

    波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团为北京工人演出
    【新华社三日讯】波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团三日下午为北京市工人群众演出音乐、舞蹈。
    表演会开始前一小时，人流自各方涌向先农坛体育场，宽阔的广场上挤满了四万多观众。
    四时许，演出大会开始，北京市总工会文教部副部长阎戎在会上致欢迎词，他代表首都工人向以潘努夫尼克为首的歌舞团全体同志表示热诚的谢意。歌舞团副团长顿巴鲁夫斯基也在会上讲话，他对中国人民对他们的热忱欢迎表示谢意。
    在北京市工人代表向歌舞团献礼后，歌舞团表演了二十多个合唱和舞蹈节目。观众以热烈的鼓掌和欢呼来欢迎每一节目。歌舞团以愉快的旋律唱出了正在走向社会主义的波兰工人和农民的幸福生活。
    他们的集体舞蹈在舞台上绘出了千变万化的美丽图案。“玛茹卡舞”更受到观众的喜爱，这个舞蹈的情节是：小鸟飞走了，少年追上了她，一同跳舞。在观众的热烈掌声中歌舞团重演了这个节目。帕龙斯卡民歌“小杜鹃”也在观众要求下重唱了两次。
    表演结束时，北京市工人代表数十人走上舞台向歌舞团及伴奏的乐队献花，表示衷心的谢意。
