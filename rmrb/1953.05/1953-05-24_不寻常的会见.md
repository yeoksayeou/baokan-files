An Unusual Meeting
Lian Yunshan

Around 5:00 PM on May 5th, a middle-aged couple hurried to the entrance of the Beijing No. 1 Guesthouse, the residence of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's returning delegation for the National Day observation ceremonies. They requested immediate permission to meet with Comrade Deng Wanqin, a representative of the delegation. As usual, the comrades at the reception patiently explained: "Comrades, please forgive us, but the delegation is extremely busy these days. They have meetings, report presentations, tours, and banquets, leaving them no time to rest. Too many people want to see them; it's just not feasible! Please try to meet them at the mass rally!" Hearing the explanation, their faces became agitated, and they said almost simultaneously, "Comrade, we made an appointment with Comrade Deng Wanqin on the phone this morning." Then, the woman produced a letter and handed it to the comrade at the reception, saying, "This isn't just a casual meeting; please read this page of the letter!" The letter read: "Dear Sister Yulin, please, you must go and see Comrade Deng Wanqin, who rescued me from the great fire, regardless of her own safety! Because of her consistently active and diligent work, and for rescuing me, she has been honorably selected to return to the country to participate in the 'May Day' observation ceremonies... From your sister Yuzhu, April 16th."

Only then were they allowed to enter. When the staff led them to a young woman wearing a Korean War Merit Medal and introduced her as "This is Second-Class Merit Holder, Nurse Deng Wanqin," the woman stepped forward, embraced Deng Wanqin, then grasped her hands tightly, sat face-to-face with Deng Wanqin, with tears of excitement and gratitude in her eyes. Deng Wanqin knew that this woman was Ren Yuzhu's elder sister, Ren Yulin, and the man was Ren Yulin's husband, Liu Fengchi. After a while, they began to talk.

The story was as follows:

On the evening of November 20th of the previous year, enemy night-flying aircraft flew over the field hospital where Deng Wanqin was stationed. In the distance, the strong white light of our searchlights pierced the night sky, searching for these American aerial bandits. Strings of red anti-aircraft fire flew from all directions towards the high sky, forming a belt of fire in the enemy's flight path. Deng Wanqin was about to write in her diary in her room when she heard the air raid alarm and went to check the windows, which were already tightly sealed. Later, when the enemy planes turned back, they dropped thirty or forty bombs and gasoline bombs, several of which landed directly on the hospital. Deng Wanqin saw a strong flash of electric light outside, followed by an earth-shattering explosion, as if the mountain had collapsed and the earth had split. The room shook violently, and then with a "whoosh," the room's beam brushed against her left cheek and fell down, with tiles and clods of earth covering her head. Her face burned and her head throbbed. She tried to look, but couldn't open her eyes. She wanted to get up, but felt that her lower body was buried in the soil. She only heard the fire roaring from all directions. "I'm afraid I won't be able to get out; I'm going to be burned to death by the fire. If I can't get out, it will be an honor to sacrifice for the motherland and for the cause of resisting America and aiding Korea." While thinking this, she desperately dug at the soil, and with a sudden effort, she struggled free. She rubbed her eyes and looked around. Suddenly, she noticed that there was still a section of wall in front of her that had not been engulfed by the fire. She pushed the wall hard, and with a "crash," the wall collapsed, and she stepped over the flames and rushed out. She breathed a sigh of relief. When she turned around to look at the raging fire, she suddenly remembered that Ren Yuzhu was still sleeping inside the room. Ren Yuzhu, her lively and lovely colleague, had taken a sleeping pill and fallen asleep just before the room was bombed because she was ill. Now that the room had been bombed and collapsed, and the raging fire was engulfing the area, Ren Yuzhu would either be crushed to death or burned to death immediately. "The Party has educated us; can we just stand by and watch her burn to death? No, I have to save her!" Deng Wanqin turned around and rushed back into the fire. She shouted loudly in the thick smoke and flames, "Ren Yuzhu!" "Ren Yuzhu!" She immediately heard Ren Yuzhu's faint reply. Deng Wanqin rushed towards the sound. When she reached the place where Ren Yuzhu had responded, she saw that a burning beam was lying across the area. She tried to move it, but couldn't. At this time, Ren Yuzhu's voice was even weaker. "I have to save her!" With a desperate heave, she didn't know where the strength came from, but the beam rolled away. While shouting, she forcefully pushed aside the scorching-hot soil pressing on Ren Yuzhu's body, pulled up the blanket covering her that hadn't been burned yet, forcefully pulled Ren Yuzhu's hands out, placed them on her shoulders, carried Ren Yuzhu on her back, and rushed through the fire.

A Korean worker who was fighting the fire rushed over, took Ren Yuzhu from Deng Wanqin's back, and ran to the air-raid shelter at the aid station. Deng Wanqin followed him in. Ren Yuzhu woke up from her coma, rubbed her eyes, and said with immense gratitude, "Comrade Deng Wanqin, you saved me. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved me..."

Deng Wanqin's eyes were stinging from the smoke and she could not open them. Her feet, hands and face were also burned. She needed help to walk. After more than a month of treatment, her injuries healed, but her eyesight weakened. Ren Yuzhu's jaw, chest and legs were also burned. After she regained her health, she wrote a letter to her sister, which contained the following passage:

"Sister Yulin, Brother-in-law Fengchi, and my little nephews and nieces: Let me tell you! The American imperialists burned everything I had to the ground, leaving me with only my life. I will never forget this hatred. Today, I am able to breathe freely, live happily, and excitedly write to you. All of this happiness was given to me by Comrade Deng Wanqin, who was nurtured by the Party and Chairman Mao. I am now working with unparalleled enthusiasm. I want to strive to be an excellent medical worker, learn from Comrade Deng Wanqin's great spirit of self-sacrifice, strive to achieve merit in battle and work, and strive to join the Party to thank the Party and Chairman Mao, and to thank Comrade Deng Wanqin. Please wait for news of me fulfilling this wish!"

When Ren Yulin and her husband received this letter, the whole family was having dinner. They hadn't received a letter from Yuzhu for a long time, and they excitedly opened it, but their mood became heavy. Their hatred for the enemy, their gratitude to Deng Wanqin, and the way Deng Wanqin's great spirit of self-sacrifice spurred them on... all sorts of complex emotions intertwined, and they couldn't eat their dinner. The whole family was silent for a long time. Finally, Liu Fengchi said, "In the old society, who would have been willing to rush into a fire to save Yuzhu? We should still thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for nurturing this generation in the new society!" From that moment on, the couple decided to work and study even harder. During the day, they worked hard to do their jobs well in their respective organizations, and in the evening, they added an hour of political study at home to accelerate their self-improvement. They were determined to serve the motherland even better to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and to thank Comrade Deng Wanqin.

Ren Yulin and her husband received Yuzhu's letter on April 22nd. When they learned that Deng Wanqin was a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's returning delegation for the National Day observation ceremonies and was coming to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, they had been inquiring about her whereabouts until they finally found Deng Wanqin this day.

After listening to Deng Wanqin's detailed account of how she rescued Yuzhu from the fire, Ren Yulin was moved and asked, "When you had just come out of the fire and were about to go back into the fire, did you ever think about the danger to yourself?" Deng Wanqin flicked her two small braids behind her back and replied kindly, "I didn't think about any danger at all; I only thought about saving her."

"Wanqin, how about this!" Ren Yulin put her hands on Deng Wanqin's shoulders and said, "You risked your life to save my sister, so from now on, you, like Yuzhu, are my own sister. Let's go! I'm taking you to my house today. The children are clamoring to see their glorious auntie!"

    不寻常的会见
    连云山
    五月五日下午五时左右，在志愿军归国观礼代表团的住所——北京第一宾馆的门口，匆匆走来一对中年夫妇，要求允许他们马上进去会见代表团的代表邓万芹同志。传达室的同志照例耐心地解释说：“同志，请原谅，这几天代表团的同志太忙了，又要开会，又要报告，又要参观，又要赴宴，整天不得休息，要看他们的人太多，怎么行呀！还是请你们在群众大会上和他们会见吧！”听着传达室同志的解释，他们脸色变得激动起来，几乎是同时说道：“同志，这是今天上午我们和邓万芹同志在电话上约好的时间。”接着那位女的就拿出了一封信一边递给传达室的同志，一边说道：“我们这不像一般的会见，请看这页信吧！”信上是这样写的：“亲爱的玉林姐，请你们一定去看看那位不顾自己危险把我从大火中抢救出来的邓万芹同志吧！她因为一贯工作积极努力，又抢救了我而光荣地归国参加‘五一’节观礼了……玉竹妹上。四月十六日。”
    他们这才被允许进去了。当工作人员把他们带到一个胸前挂着朝鲜军功章的年轻的姑娘面前给他们介绍说：“这就是二等功臣、护士邓万芹同志”时，那位女的抢前一步，一把将邓万芹抱住，然后又紧紧地握着邓万芹的手，和邓万芹面对面地坐下，眼睛里闪着兴奋和感激的泪花。邓万芹知道这个女的就是任玉竹的姐姐任玉林，男的就是任玉林的丈夫刘凤池。好一会他们才开始谈起来。
    事情原来是这样的：
    去年十一月二十日晚上，敌人的夜航机群，飞过邓万芹所在的野战医院的上空。远处，我们的探照灯的强烈白光，划破夜空，寻找着这群美国的空中强盗，一串串的红色的高射炮火，从四面八方飞向高空，在敌机航路上打成一条火带。邓万芹在房里正要写日记，听到防空警报的枪声，就连忙去检查那本来堵得非常严密的窗户。后来那群敌机拐回来以后就把三四十个炸弹和汽油弹投了下来，有几个就恰恰落在这座医院里了。邓万芹看见外面强烈的电光一闪，接着山崩地裂似的一声响，屋子震得要跳起来一样，跟着“哗喳”一声，屋子的大梁“呼”地擦着她的左脸坠下来了，瓦片土块也没头没脑地往下盖。她脸烧头胀，要看看，但眼睛睁不开了，她要起来，但觉得下半身又埋在土里，只听得大火呼呼地从四面响过来。“恐怕出不去了吧，要被大火烧死了；如果出不去，为了祖国，为了抗美援朝，牺牲了也是光荣的。”她一边想一边拚命地拨土，一使劲挣了出来。她揉揉眼睛，四下一看，忽然发现前面一堵墙还有一处没有被火吞没。她把墙狠命一推，“哗拉”一声墙倒了，她就踏着火焰飞奔出来。她才松了一口气，回头一看那团团烈火，猛然想起屋里还睡着任玉竹。那个和她一起工作的活泼可爱的任玉竹，因为有病，就在屋子被炸的前一会吃了安眠药睡着了。现在屋子被炸塌了，烈火笼罩了那个地方，任玉竹不被压死，也马上要烧死了。“党教育了我们，我们能眼看着她被烧死吗？不能，我要救她！”邓万芹转身又冲进大火去了。她在浓烟烈火中大声喊叫：“任玉竹！”“任玉竹！”立刻听到任玉竹微弱的回答的声音。邓万芹顺着这声音扑过去。扑到任玉竹应声的地方，看到那个地方横压着一根燃烧着的大梁，她想搬开它，但是没搬动。这时，任玉竹的声音更低了。“我要救她！”她狠命一搬，不知从那里来的力量，大梁滚开了。她一面喊，一面用力拨开压在任玉竹身上烧得滚热的土，扯起盖在她身上的还没烧着的被子，使劲地把任玉竹的两手拉出来，搭在肩上，背着任玉竹，冲过大火，奔了出来。
    一位正在救火的朝鲜工人飞奔过来，把任玉竹从邓万芹背上接过去，飞跑到救护所的防空洞去了，邓万芹也跟了进去。任玉竹从昏迷中醒过来，揉着眼睛，万分感激地说：“邓万芹同志，是你救了我，是党和毛主席救了我……”
    邓万芹的眼睛被烟薰得睁不开了，脚上、手上和脸上也都被火烧伤了，走路也要人牵着，经过一个多月的治疗，伤才痊愈，但视力却减弱了。任玉竹的下颚、胸部和腿上也被火烤伤了。当她恢复健康以后，给她姐姐写了一封信，信上有这么一段：
    “玉林姐、凤池姐夫和小宝宝们：让我告诉你们吧！美帝国主义把我的一切都烧光了，只剩下一条命，这仇恨我永生难忘。今天我能够自由地呼吸，愉快地生活，兴奋地给你们写信，这些幸福都是党和毛主席教养了的邓万芹同志给我的。我现在正以无比的热情工作着，我要争取做一个优秀的医务工作人员，学习邓万芹同志伟大的自我牺牲的精神，在战斗中和工作中争取立功，争取入党，来感谢党和毛主席，感谢邓万芹同志。请你们等着我实现这个愿望的消息吧！”
    任玉林夫妇接到这封信的时候，全家正在吃晚饭。许久没有接到玉竹的信了，他们兴奋地打开一看，心情沉重起来；对敌人的仇恨，对邓万芹的感激，以及邓万芹这种自我牺牲的伟大精神对自己的鞭策……各种的复杂的感情交织在一起，饭也吃不下了。全家沉默了好久，最后刘凤池才说：“如果在旧社会里，有谁肯扑到火里去救玉竹呢？还是应该感谢共产党和毛主席，教养了新社会这一代人！”从那时起，夫妇俩就决定要更好地工作和学习。他们白天在机关里努力做好工作，晚上在家里又增加了一个钟头的政治学习，来加紧提高自己；决心为祖国更好地服务，来感谢共产党和毛主席，感谢邓万芹同志。
    任玉林夫妇从四月二十二日接到玉竹的信，知道了邓万芹是志愿军归国观礼代表团代表，要来北京参加“五一”节观礼，就一直打听着，直到这天才找到了邓万芹。
    听了邓万芹叙述她如何从大火中抢救玉竹的详细情形后，任玉林被感动得问道：“当你刚从火里出来，又要进火里去；你就没有想到对你自己是危险的吗？”邓万芹把两根小辫向后一甩，亲切地答道：“我根本没有想到什么危险，只想到要救她。”
    “万芹，这样吧！”，任玉林把两手搭在邓万芹的肩上说：“你冒着生命的危险救了我的妹妹，以后你也和玉竹一样，就是我的亲妹妹了。走吧！我今天接你到我家里去，孩子们也吵闹着要看看他们这个光荣的姨姨呢！”
