Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 18th: The Bonn "Federal Senate" discussed the ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties again on May 15th and decided that the main parts of the treaties "do not require" Senate approval. It approved the technical supplementary agreement on the "European Defense Community" treaty by a vote of 23 to 15.

During the first discussion on April 24th, the Senate voted 20 to 18 to postpone the decision on the war treaties. Since then, Adenauer has exerted pressure on Mehlhorn, the Prime Minister of the Baden-Württemberg state government and Chairman of the Senate, who played a pivotal role in the vote. As a result, Mehlhorn guaranteed support for the ratification of the treaties. Thus, the issue was put back on the agenda. On May 15th, Mehlhorn proposed a "compromise" plan at the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting and the Senate meeting, stating that the basic content of the Bonn and Paris treaties was not within the purview of Senate approval and "did not require (Senate) consent." Under the cover of this plan, the five representatives of Baden-Württemberg, where the Social Democrats are in the majority, voted in favor this time, forming a majority for the approval of the supplementary agreement, and in effect helping Adenauer obtain the Senate's approval of the entire war treaty.

French newspaper reporters in Bonn commented on the Bonn Senate's decision, pointing out that the dispute over the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties was not over. West German President Heuss had stated that he would not sign the Bonn and Paris treaties until the "Federal Constitutional Court" had made a decision.

    波恩参议院不顾人民反对批准波恩和巴黎战争条约
    【新华社十八日讯】柏林消息：波恩“联邦参议院”于五月十五日再度讨论批准波恩与巴黎战争条约的问题，决定条约的主要部分“不需要”参议院批准，并以二十三票对十五票表决批准了关于“欧洲防务集团”条约的技术性补充协定。
    参议院在四月二十四日第一次讨论时，曾以二十票对十八票表决延期就战争条约作出决定。在那以后，阿登纳对在表决中起举足轻重作用的瓦登堡—巴登州政府总理、参议院主席梅尔加施压力。结果梅尔保证支持批准条约。于是问题再次被列入议程。梅尔十五日在外交委员会会议和参议院会议上提出了一项“折衷”方案，说波恩与巴黎条约的基本内容不在参议院批准的权限之内，“不需要（参议院的）同意”。在这一方案的掩护下，社会民主党占多数的瓦登堡—巴登州的五个代表这次改投赞成票，构成了批准补充协定的多数，实际上帮助阿登纳取得了参议院对整个战争条约的批准。
    法国报纸驻波恩记者在评论波恩参议院的决定时指出，关于批准波恩与巴黎条约问题的争执还没有结束，西德总统休斯曾表示，在“联邦宪法法院”未作决定之前，他将不签署波恩及巴黎条约。
