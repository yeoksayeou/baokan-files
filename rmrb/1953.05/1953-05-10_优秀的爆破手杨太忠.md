    The February in Korea, ice and snow sealed the mountains, and the fierce north wind blew day and night. The wind and snow were even greater on the eastern front. The valiant soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers braved the wind and snow, continuously carrying out outstanding surprise attacks, annihilating a large number of enemies.
    The sixth company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers received the task of attacking the enemy forces on the "Little Nameless Mountain" high ground. The company assigned this task to the second platoon; Yang Taizhong of the seventh squad and his group were designated to take on the blasting mission. Yang Taizhong was a twenty-one-year-old lad with a dark complexion, broad chest, and a pair of rough hands, like a man made of iron. He had arrived on the Korean battlefield after the Fifth Campaign in 1951. However, this was the first time he had taken on a blasting mission.
    "Yang Taizhong, this task is difficult!" Seventh Squad Leader Ai Rongtang pulled Yang Taizhong, leaning close to the stone wall of the tunnel, and sat down. Yang Taizhong looked at Seventh Squad Leader's eyes, which revealed unparalleled concern for his comrades, and his smiling face, saying, "Yes! Winter operations, the first difficulty is the deep snow and slippery roads..." Seventh Squad Leader asked him again, "Have you thought of a solution?" Yang Taizhong replied confidently, "I am thinking: I am the leader of a blasting squad, my task is how to lead the squad to open the way for the troops to charge. We can choose mountain slopes with smaller gradients to climb, if the gradient is small, it will not be easy to slip; in addition, we can wrap burlap sacks around our feet, just like the anti-skid chains on cars!"
    Seventh Squad Leader was obviously attracted by Yang Taizhong's conversation, he recalled when Yang Taizhong first came to the squad more than a year ago, he didn't say a word all day long. Seventh Squad Leader asked him, "Why don't you talk?" Yang Taizhong replied, "I don't understand anything, what can I say?" Seventh Squad Leader said, "Why do you say you don't understand anything? Don't you understand that before liberation you carried manure and did hard labor for the landlords, and suffered oppression and hardship; after liberation, poor people can stand up and speak?" Yang Taizhong said, "That's what I personally experienced!" Seventh Squad Leader said, "It's good to understand this. We are all brothers, if you don't understand, ask; if you can't do it, follow and learn, what are you afraid of?" Seventh Squad Leader's words opened up Yang Taizhong's mind, and later Yang Taizhong really asked about everything; he also learned this and that; he learned shooting and blasting; in the hot weather, his clothes were often soaked with sweat again and again, and then dried in the sun again and again. When military tests were held, he knew everything he was asked, and got full marks. This new soldier grew up rapidly in the flames of war.
    On the night of February 12, before the start of the surprise attack, all pre-war preparations were complete. Yang Taizhong, holding three big bags of explosives, and his team members Zhang Shoumei and Han Ziyi, were waiting for the order to enter the assault starting point. Seventh Squad Leader did a final inspection and encouraged the blasting team to complete the task. Yang Taizhong said resolutely as if making an oath: "Squad Leader, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, I will do everything in my power, even if I sacrifice myself, I will complete the task!" Seventh Squad Leader stopped him with a gesture, saying, "Why mention sacrifice? We are not allowed to sacrifice! Have you forgotten that we learn tactics and techniques in order to eliminate the enemy and preserve ourselves?" "I remember." Yang Taizhong thought, the Squad Leader is right.
    It was eleven o'clock at night. White snow glittered in the fields, and the earth was so silent that there was not a sound. Suddenly, like an avalanche, our artillery began a rapid assault; three minutes later, the artillery fire extended to the rear of the enemy's position, and the soldiers of the second platoon shouted, "For the motherland, charge!" and quickly rushed forward.
    Yang Taizhong led his blasting team at the forefront of the troops. This was truly a pleasant charge, in an instant they advanced one hundred and twenty meters, without encountering any resistance. But when they reached thirty meters away from the enemy, suddenly, a string of fierce flames spewed out from the left side of the enemy's position, and a light machine gun roared like a ferocious monster, blocking the advance of our army.
    Yang Taizhong lay prone, close to the snow, half his body sinking into the snow. He glared at the machine gun spewing flames, thinking, "This is a new enemy firing point, how come it wasn't discovered during the last reconnaissance?" No sooner said than done, Yang Taizhong, taking advantage of the enemy's brief break to change the cartridge, quickly rolled forward five meters, and shouted loudly, "I'm going to eliminate it!" He pounced on the enemy's trench, with a force, jumped to the enemy's bunker, and threw two hand grenades into the bunker, as he just jumped away from the bunker, with a bang, the hand grenades bloomed in the bunker. However, the enemy's light machine gun continued to spew flames, Yang Taizhong immediately jumped to the bunker above the machine gun firing hole, stretched out his right hand, suddenly grabbed the enemy's machine gun, and snatched it away; his left hand threw another explosive charge into the firing hole. He was running not far on the top of the mountain with the machine gun in his hand, when he heard a loud bang, the bunker and the enemy flew into the sky together.
    At this time, the second platoon's assault troops also rushed to the top of the mountain and successfully occupied the enemy's position.
    Then, Seventh Squad Leader Ai Rongtang led a combat team, and rushed all the way to the enemy's command post. There, the enemy used the firepower of two heavy machine guns, fiercely blocking the entrance of the cave. Seventh Squad Leader threw a hand grenade at the entrance of the cave and rushed straight up, just as he killed an enemy, he was also hit and gloriously sacrificed.
    When Yang Taizhong led the blasting team to the scene, he was heartbroken to hear that Seventh Squad Leader had sacrificed. In that instant, he remembered the cultivation and care the Squad Leader had given him during his life. Seventh Squad Leader's words rang in his ears again: "Why mention sacrifice? We are not allowed to sacrifice!" Seventh Squad Leader did not allow others to sacrifice, but he sacrificed himself heroically. Thinking of this, Yang Taizhong shouted, "Comrades: We must avenge the Squad Leader!"
    "Platoon Leader, please allow me to blast!" Yang Taizhong immediately requested a mission from the Platoon Leader. The Platoon Leader contacted the instructor and agreed to his request, and said to him: "Be sure to complete the task!" Yang Taizhong replied, "I guarantee it!" and picked up an explosive charge, under the cover of the combat team led by Seventh Squad Deputy Leader Li Guangrong, and rushed forward. He cleverly avoided the firepower, ran to the outside of the left tunnel entrance, pulled the fuse of the explosive charge, and threw it into the cave. The first pack of explosives exploded with a bang; he picked up the second pack of explosives, pulled the fuse, and quickly threw it into the right tunnel entrance. However, the enemy's heavy machine guns were still roaring in the tunnel fortifications. At this time, Yang Taizhong glared at the two dangerous tongues of fire, and remembered Seventh Squad Leader's words: "Have you forgotten that we learn tactics and techniques in order to eliminate the enemy and preserve ourselves?" When he picked up the third pack of explosives, he decided to choose the terrain where blasting was most likely to be effective. He ran to the top of the left tunnel entrance, put the explosives on top, pulled the fuse, the explosives exploded, and stones and soil were collapsed, covering the entrance of the cave, and immediately, a machine gun became mute. He picked up the fourth pack of explosives and ran to the top of the right tunnel entrance to blast, in the flying sand and stones, the enemy's other machine gun also became mute. However, the fire of revenge was still burning fiercely in Yang Taizhong's heart, he picked up the fifth and sixth packs of explosives, and blasted the two tunnel entrances to pieces, and two reinforced platoons of enemies were all blasted to death in the cave.
    The first night's surprise attack ended victoriously after annihilating a reinforced platoon of the Li pseudo-army's Third Division. On the second night, our army followed the same route and rushed to the top of "Little Nameless Mountain", under the cover of powerful artillery fire, and annihilated the enemy who were repairing fortifications. On the second night, Yang Taizhong and his team again continuously repelled five counterattacks by five enemy platoons, killing and wounding more than thirty enemies, and held the position.
    In the two nights of surprise attacks, the second platoon of the sixth company of a certain unit completely annihilated three reinforced platoons of the enemy, a total of more than one hundred and twenty people; Yang Taizhong and his team alone eliminated more than seventy enemies. Yang Taizhong was awarded a first-class merit, and the group he led was also awarded a collective third-class merit. (Attached picture)

    优秀的爆破手杨太忠
    孙景瑞
    朝鲜的二月，冰雪封冻着山岭，日夜吹着凛冽的北风。东线的风雪更大。志愿军的勇士们冒着风雪，连续不断地进行着出色的袭击战，大量地歼灭着敌人。
    志愿军某部六连接受了袭击某高地“小无名山”敌军的任务。连里把这个任务交给了二排；七班的杨太忠和他的小组，被指定担任爆破任务。杨太忠是一个二十一岁的小伙子，黑脸膛，宽胸脯，一双粗大的手，就像个铁打的人。他是一九五一年第五次战役后就来到了朝鲜战场的。可是担任爆破任务这还是第一次。
    “杨太忠，这次任务可困难呀！”七班长艾荣堂拉着杨太忠，紧靠着坑道的石壁坐下来。杨太忠看了看七班长的流露着对同志无比关怀的眼睛，和他那副微笑的脸说道：“是呀！冬季作战，第一个困难是雪深路滑……”七班长再问他一句：“你想过解决的办法吗？”杨太忠自信地答道：“我正在想：我是一个爆破小组长，我的任务是怎样带领小组为部队打开冲锋的道路。我们可以选择坡度小的山坡登山，坡度小，就不容易滑下来；另外，我们还可以把麻包片子裹在脚上，就像汽车的防滑练子一样！”
    七班长显然被杨太忠的谈话吸引住了，他回想起一年多以前杨太忠刚来到班里的时候，一天到晚一句话也不说。七班长问他：“你为啥不说话呢？”杨太忠答道：“我啥也不懂，可说啥呢？”七班长说：“你为什么说啥也不懂呢？你不是懂得解放前给地主挑粪，扛活，受压迫，受苦；解放后穷人可以站起来说话了吗？”杨太忠说：“那是我身受的呀！”七班长说：“懂得这个就好。咱们都是亲弟兄，不懂就问，不会就跟着学，怕啥？”七班长的话使杨太忠心里开了窍，以后杨太忠果然东也问，西也问；这也学，那也学；学射击，学爆破；在大热天，常常衣服被汗水一次一次地浸湿了，又一次一次地在太阳地里晒干。举行军事测验的时候，问什么会什么，得了满分。这个新的战士在战火中迅速地成长起来了。
    二月十二日夜间，袭击战开始以前，一切战前准备工作都停当了。杨太忠抱着三大包炸药，和他的组员张守美、韩自益三个人，正在等着进入冲锋出发地的命令。七班长又做了最后一次检查，鼓励爆破组一定要完成任务。杨太忠好像宣誓一样坚决地说：“班长，我是一个青年团员，我一定尽我的一切力量，就是牺牲了也要完成任务！”七班长用手势止住他的话，说：“干么提到牺牲呢？我们是不准牺牲的！你忘了我们学习战术技术是为了消灭敌人、保存自己的吗？”“我记住了。”杨太忠想，班长的话是对的。
    这时是深夜十一点钟。白雪在山野里闪着银光，大地寂静得没有一点声音。突然，像山崩地裂一样，我方的大炮开始急袭了；三分钟后，炮火向敌人阵地后方延伸，二排的战士们呐喊一声：“为祖国，冲呀！”就迅速地冲上前去。
    杨太忠带领着他的爆破组冲在队伍的最前面。这真是一次愉快的冲锋，一瞬间他们就前进了一百二十公尺，没有遇到一点抵抗。可是进到距离敌人三十公尺远的时候，突然，从敌人阵地的左方喷出了一串猛烈的火舌，轻机枪像一头凶恶的怪物在吼叫着，挡住了我军前进的道路。
    杨太忠紧贴着雪地匍匐着，半边身子陷进雪里去。他怒视着那挺喷着火焰的机枪，想道：“这是敌人的一个新的火力点，上次侦察的时候怎么都没发现呢？”说时迟，那时快，杨太忠趁着敌人换梭子的短暂空隙，迅速地向前滚进了五公尺，大声喊道：“我去消灭它！”他猛地扑到了敌人阵地的交通沟上，一用劲，一步跳到敌人的地堡上，顺手把两颗手榴弹扔进地堡里，当他刚刚跳离地堡时，轰的一声，手榴弹在地堡里开了花。但是，敌人的轻机枪仍然喷吐着火焰，杨太忠又立刻跳到机枪射口的地堡上面，伸出右手，猛然一把抓住了敌人的机枪，夺了过来；左手顺着射击孔又扔进去一个炸药包。他提着机枪刚转身在山顶上跑了不远，就听得轰隆一声巨响，地堡和敌人一齐飞上了半天。
    这时，二排的冲锋部队也冲上了山头，顺利地占领了敌人的阵地。
    接着，七班长艾荣堂带领着一个战斗小组，一直冲到了敌人的指挥所。那里敌人用两挺重机枪的火力，猛烈地封锁着洞口。七班长向洞口打了一颗手榴弹就直扑上去，刚打死了一个敌人，自己也被击中，光荣地牺牲了。
    当杨太忠带着爆破组冲到时，听说七班长牺牲了，真是心如刀割。在那一瞬，他想起了班长生前对自己的培养和爱护。七班长的话又在他的耳边响着：“干么提到牺牲呢？我们是不准牺牲的！”七班长不准别人牺牲，自己却英勇地牺牲了。杨太忠想到这里，大喊一声：“同志们：我们要替班长报仇！”
    “排长，请准许我去爆破！”杨太忠马上向排长要求任务。排长和指导员联络了一下，答应了他的要求，并且对他说：“一定要完成任务！”杨太忠一边回答：“我保证！”一边就抱起了一个炸药包，在七班副班长李光荣带领的战斗小组的掩护下，冲上前去。他机警地避开火力，跑到左边的坑道口外，把炸药包的导火索一拉，顺手扔进洞里去。第一包炸药轰的一声爆炸了；他又抱起了第二包炸药，拉开火，迅速地投进右边的坑道口里。但是，敌人的重机枪在坑道工事里仍然吼叫着。这时，杨太忠怒视着两道凶险的火舌，想起了七班长的话：“你忘了我们学习战术技术是为了消灭敌人、保存自己的吗？”当他抱起第三包炸药时，就决定选择爆破最易发生效力的地形。他跑上左边那个坑道口的顶上，把炸药放在上面，拉开火，炸药爆炸了，石头和泥土一起被崩下来，掩盖了洞口，立刻，一挺机枪变成哑吧了。他又抱起第四包炸药，跑到右边那个坑道口顶上爆破，在沙石飞扬中，敌人的另一挺机枪也变成哑吧了。但是，复仇的怒火仍然炽烈地燃烧着杨太忠的心，他又抱起了第五包和第六包炸药，把两个坑道口炸得稀烂，两个加强班的敌人全被炸死在洞里。
    第一夜的袭击战，在消灭了李伪军第三师的一个加强排以后，胜利地结束了。第二夜，我军又顺着原路冲上了“小无名山”的山顶，在强大炮火的掩护下，消灭了正在抢修工事的敌人。在第二个夜晚，杨太忠和他的小组，又连续打退了敌人五个班的五次反扑，打死打伤敌人三十多名，守住了阵地。
    在两个夜晚的袭击战中，某部六连二排全部歼灭了敌人三个加强排，一共一百二十多人；仅杨太忠和他的小组，就消灭了敌人七十多名。杨太忠光荣地立了一等功，他领导的小组也立了集体三等功。（附图片）
