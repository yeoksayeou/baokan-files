Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th—On the nights of the 15th and 16th, the Korean-Chinese People's Forces captured nine enemy positions in counterattacks on the central and eastern fronts. Preliminary statistics indicate that two entire companies and five platoons of the Li pseudo-army, and the majority of one company and two platoons, totaling more than 600 enemy troops, were annihilated; and three rocket launchers, eleven light and heavy machine guns, ninety-seven automatic rifles, and three walkie-talkies were captured.

In these battles, Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, filled with boundless fury over the recent U.S.侵朝 (literally "invading Korea") aircraft bombing of An Dong City and the massacre of our compatriots, bravely charged enemy positions with the support of intense artillery fire. The two larger counterattacks occurred on the famous Shangganling and Yuyinshan frontlines. On the night of the 15th, our forces on the Shangganling front captured two hilltops east and southeast of Height 597.9, completely annihilating the defending 10th Company of the 28th Regiment of the Li pseudo-army's 9th Division, and another platoon, totaling more than 170 enemy troops. On the night of the 16th, our forces on the Yuyinshan front, with the support of artillery fire, captured the positions of the 6th Company and a reconnaissance platoon of the 60th Regiment of the Li pseudo-army's 20th Division in just five minutes; and on this newly captured position, they repelled the enemy forces that came to reinforce, annihilating more than 170 enemy troops in total.

In addition, fierce fighting on a highland south of Kho-ri on the central front has lasted for four days and nights. As of noon on the 17th, our forces had annihilated nearly 1,000 troops of the Li pseudo-army's 8th Division in this area. On the 16th, in addition to driving back small groups of enemy troops that harassed us, our forces took the initiative to launch an attack, completely annihilating an entire enemy squad lurking nearby. On the 17th, the enemy launched a multi-pronged attack with a battalion of troops under the cover of smoke. One group of enemy troops barely managed to climb onto a small hilltop at the northern end of the highland, but our forces immediately launched a counter-attack under the cover of artillery fire, annihilating all of these enemy troops. The enemy forces abandoned more than 200 bodies on this highland.

    中线东线朝中人民部队攻占九个敌军阵地
    科湖里以南一高地上歼敌近千名
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】十五、十六日夜间，中线和东线的朝中人民部队在反击战中攻下了九个敌军阵地。据初步统计，共歼灭李伪军两个连、五个排的全部，和一个连、两个排的大部，计六百多名；并缴获火箭筒三门、轻重机枪各十一挺，自动步枪等九十七枝，步行机三部。
    在这些战斗中，中国人民志愿军战士们怀着对最近美国侵朝飞机轰炸安东市屠杀我国同胞的无比愤怒，在猛烈的炮火配合下，奋勇冲击敌军阵地。较大的两次反击战，发生在著名的上甘岭和鱼隐山前线。十五日夜，上甘岭前线我军一举攻克了五九七点九高地以东和东南的两个山头，全歼守敌李伪军第九师二十八团第十连和另外的一个排，共计一百七十多名。十六日夜，鱼隐山前线我军在炮火配合下，只经五分钟时间就攻下了李伪军二十师六十团第六连和一个搜索排的阵地；并在这个新攻占的阵地上，打退了赶来救援的敌人，共歼灭敌人一百七十多名。
    此外，中线科湖里以南的一个高地上的激战，已历时四昼夜。到十七日中午为止，我军已在这个地方歼灭了李伪军第八师近千名。十六日，我军除逐退向我窜扰的小股敌人外，曾乘胜主动出击，将潜伏在附近的敌人一个班全部歼灭。十七日，敌人以一个营的兵力在烟幕掩护下进行多路攻击，有一路敌人勉强爬上这个高地北端的一个小山头，但我军立刻在炮火掩护下向这股敌人发起反冲锋，将敌人全部歼灭。敌军丢弃在这个高地上的尸体就有二百多具。
