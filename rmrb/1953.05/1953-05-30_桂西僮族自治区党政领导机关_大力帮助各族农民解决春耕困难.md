The Communist Party of China Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee and the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government have promptly resolved the difficulties in spring plowing production for farmers of Zhuang, Yao, and Dong nationalities, issuing large amounts of agricultural loans and relief funds, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of farmers of all nationalities. This year's spring rain came earlier, and currently rice transplanting is widespread throughout the region, with seedlings in some areas already over a foot tall.

At the beginning of spring plowing, Comrade Qin Yingji, Second Secretary of the CPC Guixi Regional Committee and Chairman of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government, and other responsible comrades went to the countryside to inspect work, understand the difficulties and demands of ethnic minority farmers in spring plowing production; the CPC Guixi Regional Committee also transferred more than 20 cadres to form a production work team to lead spring plowing in the Second District of Yongning County, Zhuang Autonomous Region. This reversed the tendency of some county and district leading comrades to neglect spring plowing production.

In order to vigorously support the people of all nationalities in carrying out spring plowing production, the Autonomous Region People's Government issued a total of 16.9 billion yuan in relief funds this spring, more than 43.6 billion yuan in production loans for the first half of the year, and more than 33.4 billion yuan in short-term revolving agricultural loans. According to preliminary statistics from 14 counties directly under the Zhuang Autonomous Region, including Binyang, Hengxian, and Yongning, these counties used more than 12.5 billion yuan of the issued loans to purchase more than 9,000 head of draft cattle, more than 70,000 small farm implements, more than 1.1 million catties of seeds, and more than 180,000 dan of fertilizer, which can meet the production needs of more than 700,000 mu of land.

The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government also promoted banks, trading companies, and cooperatives to help farmers sell local and special products, and supply farmers with large quantities of living and production materials. The Shanglin County Trading Company prepared a large amount of shear iron early on, the cooperative organized small farm implement processing plants, and the district cooperatives organized private iron smelters locally, signing contracts with farmers according to the styles, weights, iron quality, and prices commonly used by farmers in each area. The Third District alone supplied more than 1,400 pieces of qualified farm implements, and also supplied farmers with a large amount of fertilizer and purchased tea oil, tung oil, cowhide, and other products. The Baise Special District promptly convened a materials exchange meeting, organizing state-owned trading organizations and private merchants to purchase the local specialties of farmers of all nationalities.

Through the work of issuing agricultural loans, relief funds, supplying various production materials, and purchasing local specialties, the political awareness and confidence in increasing production of farmers of all nationalities have been enhanced. For example, after the farmers of all nationalities in Jianglu Township, Seventh District, Shanglin County, used loans to buy draft cattle, fertilizer, and grain seeds, all the paddy and dry land was plowed a month earlier than last year, and they also increased the planting of taro and other crops for famine relief.

The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region has many mountainous areas, and wild animals roam about, harming crops and livestock, with tiger plagues being particularly serious. In order to ensure the production and safety of the lives of ethnic minority farmers, the Autonomous Region People's Government organizes farmers to hunt during the slack season, so that animal disasters are decreasing day by day.

    桂西僮族自治区党政领导机关
    大力帮助各族农民解决春耕困难
    中共广西省桂西僮族自治区委员会、桂西僮族自治区人民政府，及时解决僮、瑶、侗各族农民春耕生产的困难，发放大批农贷和救济粮款，大大提高了各族农民的生产情绪。今年春雨来得较早，目前全区已普遍插秧，个别地区秧苗已高到一尺多。
    春耕开始时，中共桂西区党委第二书记、桂西僮族自治区人民政府主席覃应机等负责同志分头下乡检查工作，了解少数民族农民春耕生产中的困难和要求；中共桂西区党委并抽调二十多名干部组成生产工作队，到僮族自治区邕宁县第二区领导春耕。这就扭转了部分县、区领导同志不重视春耕生产的偏向。
    自治区人民政府为了大力支持各族人民进行春耕生产，今年春天发放的救济粮款共一百六十九亿元，上半年生产贷款四百三十六亿多元，短期周转农贷三百三十四亿多元。据僮族自治区直属宾阳、横县、邕宁等十四个县初步统计，这些县用发放的贷款一百二十五亿多元购得耕牛九千多头，小农具七万多件，种子一百一十万多斤，肥料十八万多担，可解决七十多万亩田地生产的需要。
    桂西僮族自治区人民政府同时推动银行、贸易公司、合作社帮助农民推销土产、特产，大量供应农民生活生产资料。上林县贸易公司老早就准备了大量剪口铁，合作社组织小型农具加工厂，各区社并就地组织私营铁炉，按照各该地农民习惯使用的式样、重量、铁质、价格与农民订立合同。仅三区就供应了合乎规格的大小农具一千四百多件，并供应农民大量肥料和收购了茶油、桐油、牛皮等。百色专区及时地召开物资交流会，组织国营贸易机构和私商收购各族农民的土特产。
    经过发放农贷、救济粮款，供给各种生产资料及收购土特产等的工作，提高了各族农民政治觉悟和增产信心。如上林县七区江芦乡各族农民用贷款买得耕牛、肥料、谷种后，全部水旱田比去年提早一个月犁完，还增种了芋头等备荒作物。
    桂西僮族自治区山地很多，野兽出没，为害农作物和家畜，虎患特别严重。自治区人民政府为了保障少数民族农民生产和生命安全，在农闲时，组织农民打猎，使兽灾一天天地减少。
