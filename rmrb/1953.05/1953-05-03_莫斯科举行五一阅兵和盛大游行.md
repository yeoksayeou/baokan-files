Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st: According to TASS, Moscow, in celebration of the May Day holiday, a day of solidarity for working people worldwide, a military parade was held in Moscow's Red Square.

Troops lined up in neat formations in front of the mausoleum bearing the names of U.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin.

Red Square, adorned in festive attire, appeared especially solemn. Huge portraits of Lenin and Stalin, the founders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party, hung on the buildings opposite the Kremlin. The colorful Soviet national emblem and the emblems of the various republics symbolized the unbreakable Leninist-Stalinist friendship and unity of the Soviet people. A large crimson banner bore the slogan of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Long live the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the indestructible bulwark of friendship and glory of all nations of our motherland, the indestructible bulwark of world peace!"

Many guests began arriving at Red Square early in the morning. On the reviewing stands were representatives of the Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, renowned production innovators, Heroes of Socialist Labor, and celebrated writers, artists, and scientists, as well as collective farmers from the Moscow region. When representatives of foreign delegations ascended to the reviewing stands, they were warmly welcomed. These delegations came from many countries, including the People's Democracies, People's China, Great Britain, Brazil, Iceland, Italy, Sweden, Finland, and France. The Soviet people do everything in their power to promote international cooperation and business relations with all countries, and therefore they always warmly welcome all guests who come to visit the Soviet Union with the aim of strengthening and expanding friendly and business ties with the Soviet Union.

At ten o'clock in the morning, the leaders of the Soviet government and the Communist Party walked onto the reviewing platform on the mausoleum.

The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union Nikolai Bulganin, who was to review the troops, departed from the Spassky Tower gate of the Kremlin in a ZIS-110 convertible. Army General Pavel Artemyev, the commander-in-chief of the parade, arrived in the same type of car to greet him. Together, they toured the troops in the car. Marshal Bulganin congratulated the soldiers and officers on May Day.

After inspecting the troops, Marshal Bulganin walked onto the reviewing platform on the mausoleum and delivered a speech (full text to be published separately). At the end of the speech, thunderous cheers resounded throughout the square. The band played the solemn Soviet national anthem, and a salute was fired.

Then the parade began. The band played military music, and the motionless troops began to march across Red Square. Behind the young drummers were the cadets of the military academies, marching in precise steps past the mausoleum. Many officers in this formation had participated in the war and now wore the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union, Soviet orders, and medals, proof of their heroic deeds in the fight against Hitlerite fascism.

The blue and white flag bearing the red star, hammer, and sickle fluttered in the wind. This was the naval flag. These inheritors and continuers of the glorious traditions of the Russian Navy marched in dense formations across Red Square. Also participating in the parade were artillery units, the Taman Rifle Division, which became a Guards division for its meritorious service in the Great Patriotic War, border guards, and students from the Suvorov and Nakhimov schools. A large detachment of military bands brought up the rear of the troops.

At the same time, an air force review was also held. Fighter jets and other aircraft designed by Soviet engineers streaked through the sky at incredible speeds.

After the parade, the Moscow people's May Day procession immediately began.

An endless stream of people poured into Red Square. The marching masses, carrying flags, colorful banners, and placards, passed in formation after formation. As people walked along the Kremlin wall, they cheered and paid their respects to the Communist Party and Soviet government leaders, headed by G.M. Malenkov, who were standing on the reviewing platform of the mausoleum. Everywhere one could see the large characters "Forward to Communism!" and portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and Soviet government leaders framed with flowers. Countless placards, charts, and models illustrated the peaceful creative labor of Soviet men and women. Many banners bore the slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for May Day.

The people of Moscow paid warm tribute to the great Chinese people. They held up portraits of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the Government Administration Council, Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The marchers held up portraits of the leaders of the People's Democracies—Bierut, Zavadski, Gottwald, Zapotocky, Siroky, Chervenkov, Damianov, Rakosi, Dobi, Gheorghiu-Dej, Groza, Hoxha, Nishani, and Tsedenbal. To welcome the representatives of the heroic Korean people on the reviewing stand, the people of Moscow held up portraits of Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Moscow residents welcomed the German people, who are striving for an early peace treaty and for the establishment of a unified, independent, and peace-loving democratic Germany. They held up portraits of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grote wohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, and Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The marching masses also held up portraits of Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, and Luís Carlos Prestes, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of Brazil.

Countless workers, peasants, scientists, writers, artists, and students marched triumphantly across Red Square to the sound of songs and music. Millions of flags fluttered in the wind. The female workers of the Three Hills Textile Factory held up colorful banners made of samples of their products. Students from the Moscow University, full of youthful spirit, sang joyful songs. The procession from the Soviet Academy of Sciences carried diagrams of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. In the procession of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement and other units, the marchers held up hundreds of giant ears of wheat, forming a golden wheat field, next to which waved green flags representing young shelterbelts. The charts of the "Hammer and Sickle" factory showed that they had successfully completed their four-month production plan. As the procession from the Proletarsky district entered the square, a blossoming orchard seemed to suddenly appear before the reviewing stand. Light pink apple blossoms, lilacs, and other flowers appeared particularly bright and vibrant in the sunlight. In the procession from the Stalin Automobile Factory, which is successfully carrying out the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, workers held up placards with the slogan "Defend world peace! Fight for peace, democracy, and socialism." The people of Moscow shouted "Long live peace among all nations!" Many placards read: "There are no disputes or outstanding issues that cannot be peacefully resolved on the basis of mutual agreement between the countries concerned!"

The grand May Day celebration in Moscow, like those throughout the Soviet Union, vividly demonstrated the unity of the Soviet people and the unity of the Soviet people with the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

    莫斯科举行五一阅兵和盛大游行
    【新华社一日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：为了庆祝全世界劳动人民团结的节日——五一节，莫斯科红场上举行了阅兵式。
    部队在上有乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林的名字的陵墓前面排着整齐的队伍。
    穿上了节日盛装的红场显得分外庄严。克里姆林宫对面的建筑物上挂着苏维埃国家和共产党的缔造者列宁和斯大林的巨幅画像。彩色的苏联国徽和各加盟共和国的国徽象征着苏维埃人民的牢不可破的列宁、斯大林式的友好团结。一幅巨大的深红色长旗上面写着苏联共产党中央委员会的口号：“我们祖国各民族友谊和光荣的堡垒，不可摧毁的全世界和平堡垒——伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！”
    许多来宾一清早就开始来到红场。在观礼台上的有苏联和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表，著名的生产革新者，社会主义劳动英雄，著名的作家、艺术家和科学家，莫斯科州的集体农民。当外国代表团的代表们登上观礼台时，他们对这些外国代表表示热烈的欢迎。这些代表团来自许多国家，包括人民民主国家，人民中国、英国、巴西、冰岛、意大利、瑞典、芬兰、法国。苏联人民尽一切力量促进国际合作和与一切国家间的事务关系，因此他们始终热烈欢迎一切抱着加强和扩大与苏联的友好和事务联系的目的前来访问苏联的客人。
    上午十点钟，苏联政府和共产党的领袖们走上了陵墓上的检阅台。
    检阅部队的苏联国防部部长、苏联元帅尼古拉·布尔加宁乘着“吉斯一一○式”敞车从克里姆林宫斯巴斯基塔的门口出发。阅兵式总指挥陆军上将帕维尔·阿捷米耶夫乘着同一类型的汽车前来迎接。他们乘车共同巡视部队。布尔加宁元帅向士兵和军官们祝贺五一节。
    巡视部队完毕后，布尔加宁元帅走上陵墓上的检阅台，发表演说（全文另发）。演说完毕后雷鸣般的欢呼声响彻云霄。乐队奏起庄严的苏联国歌，礼炮齐鸣。
    于是阅兵式开始。乐队奏起军乐，一直屹立不动的队伍开始迈步走过红场。走在青年鼓手后面的便是军事学院的学员，他们以整齐的步伐在陵墓前面走过。这个行列里有许许多多的军官都参加过战争，现在佩带着苏联英雄的金星、苏联的勋章和奖章，这些都是他们在反对希特勒法西斯主义的战斗中的英雄事迹的证明。
    上面有红星、镰刀和锤子的蓝白两色旗帜随风飘扬。这就是海军旗。他们这些俄罗斯海军光荣传统的继承者和继续者排成密集的队伍，走过红场。参加检阅的还有炮兵部队、因在伟大的卫国战争中建立功勋而成为近卫师的塔曼来福枪师、边防军、苏沃罗夫学校和纳希莫夫学校的学生。走在部队最后的是一大队军乐队。
    与此同时，也进行了空军检阅。苏联工程师设计的战斗机和其他飞机以令人难以相信的速度掠空而过。
    阅兵式后，莫斯科人民五一节大游行随即开始。
    无穷尽的人流涌进红场。游行的群众打着旗帜、彩色横旗和标语牌一队队地走过去。当人们走过克里姆林宫墙边时，都向站在陵墓检阅台上的以格·马·马林科夫为首的共产党和苏维埃政府领袖们欢呼致敬。到处都可以看到“向共产主义前进！”的大字，用花朵镶边的列宁、斯大林和苏联政府领袖们的画像。无数标语牌、图表和模型说明了苏维埃男女的和平创造性的劳动。许多横旗上都写着苏联共产党中央委员会五一节的口号。
    莫斯科人民向伟大的中国人民致热烈的敬礼。他们高举着中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东、政务院总理周恩来、中国共产党中央委员会书记刘少奇、中华人民共和国中央人民政府副主席朱德的画像。游行者高举着各人民民主国家的领袖——贝鲁特、萨瓦茨基、哥特瓦尔德、萨波托斯基、西罗基、契尔文科夫、达米扬诺夫、拉科西、道比、乔治乌—德治、格罗查、霍查、尼沙尼、泽登巴尔的画像。为了欢迎观礼台上的英勇的朝鲜人民的代表，莫斯科人民高举着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉的画像。莫斯科居民欢迎为争取早日缔结和约、为建立一个统一的、独立的爱好和平的民主德国而奋斗的德国人民。他们高举着德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克、德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥和德国统一社会党中央委员会总书记瓦尔特·乌布利希的画像。游行群众还高举着法国共产党总书记多列士、意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂、美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特、西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽、英国共产党总书记波立特、越南民主共和国主席胡志明、印度共产党总书记高士、巴西共产党全国委员会总书记普列斯特斯等人的画像。
    无数工人、农民、科学家、作家、艺术家、学生在歌声和音乐声中浩浩荡荡地走过红场。千百万面旗帜迎风招展。三山纺织厂的女工们举着用她们产品的样品作成的彩色横旗。洋溢着青春气息的莫斯科大学的学生唱着愉快的歌。苏联科学院的队伍中举着列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的图样。在苏联农业和农业储存部等单位的队伍中，游行者高举的数百巨大的麦穗，形成了一片金黄色的麦田，麦田旁边招展着代表年轻的防护林带的绿色旗帜。“镰刀与锤子”工厂的图表说明他们已胜利完成了四个月生产计划。当普罗列塔斯基区的队伍进入广场时，观礼台前似乎突然出现了一个百花齐放的果园。淡红色的苹果花、紫丁香和其他花朵在日光中显得分外鲜明夺目。在顺利地执行着第五个五年计划任务的斯大林汽车工厂的队伍中，工人们高举着的标语牌上，写着“保卫全世界的和平！为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争”的口号。莫斯科人民高呼“各国间的和平万岁！”许多标语牌上写着：“没有任何纠纷或悬案不能在有关各国互相协议的基础上和平解决！”
    莫斯科的“五一”节庆祝盛举和苏联全国各地一样，生动地显示了苏联人民的团结一致，显示了苏联人民和共产党、苏联政府的团结一致。
