    Beijing Library Establishes Mobile Library Station at Guanting Reservoir Construction Site

    The Beijing Library established a mobile library station at the Guanting Reservoir construction site in early May, which was welcomed by the workers. In late March, the Beijing Library sent cadres to the Guanting Reservoir construction site to understand the workers' cultural level and reading needs, and discussed the establishment of a mobile library station with the Guanting Reservoir Trade Union. In early May, the Beijing Library transported more than 7,500 popular books, comic strips, and various books on water conservancy, civil engineering, mechanical and electrical principles, politics, and literature from Beijing to the construction site. These books are now circulating among the workers of nine units, including various migrant worker headquarters, construction offices, the mechanical and electrical department, and the engineering department. In the first three days of the arrival of the mobile library, the migrant workers in Baoding Prefecture borrowed more than 700 books. Wang Yongsan, a migrant worker from Qingyuan County, held the newly borrowed popular books such as "The Worker-Peasant Alliance Marches Forward" and happily said: "We must build the reservoir well; the Beijing Library has sent us books." Many migrant workers are borrowing literacy primers to consolidate their original literacy achievements in the villages. After work every day, the migrant workers on each construction site read books borrowed from the mobile library station in groups of three or five. In order to meet the needs of the workers at the construction site, the mobile library station is continuing to transport a large number of books from Beijing. The mobile library station is also holding photo exhibitions in turn at the workers' new villages on the construction site. Thousands of workers and migrant workers flock to watch every day.

    北京图书馆在官厅水库工地建立图书流动站
    北京图书馆五月初在官厅水库工地上建立了图书流动站，受到广大职工欢迎。北京图书馆在三月下旬就派遣干部到官厅水库工地了解职工的文化程度和阅读要求，并和官厅水库工会商议建立图书流动站。五月初，北京图书馆从北京把七千五百多册的通俗读物、连环图画以及水利土木工程、机电原理、政治、文艺等各种图书运到工地。这些书籍现已在各民工指挥部各施工所、机电科、工务科等九个单位的职工中间流动借阅。保定专区的民工们在流动图书到达的头三天，就借了七百多册。清苑县民工王永三手里拿着新借到的“工农联盟向前进”等通俗读物，高兴地说：“咱可得好好修水库，北京图书馆都给咱送书来了。”许多民工借阅速成识字补充读物，要用这些读物来巩固自己原来在村里速成识字的成绩。各工地的民工们每天下班后，都三五成群地阅读从图书流动站借来的书籍。为了满足工地职工们的需要，图书流动站正继续从北京运来大批书籍。图书流动站还在工地的工人新村轮流举行图片展览。每天都有上千的工人民工挤着去观看。
