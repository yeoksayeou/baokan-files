Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: Vietnamese newspapers published on May 20th the new decrees of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on land policy, the establishment of special people's courts in mass mobilization areas, and the punishment of landlords who disobey the decrees.

    The new land policy decrees include provisions for rent and interest reduction, confiscation and distribution of land belonging to French colonialists, Vietnamese traitors, and reactionaries, distribution of donated and public land, and handling of absentee landlords' land and private wasteland.

    Before the August Revolution in Vietnam, 75 percent of the country's land was controlled by French colonialists and Vietnamese landlords, and more than 10 million working farmers did not own an inch of land. After the victory of the August Revolution, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam successively promulgated decrees on rent and interest reduction, confiscation of land belonging to French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors, and requisition of ownerless land for temporary distribution to landless or land-poor farmers. These decrees benefited more than 500,000 farmers. However, due to the resistance and sabotage of reactionary landlords and bullies, and the insufficient implementation by some local government organs, the land policy was not fully implemented.

    In order to mobilize the strength of the peasants, promote the production movement, and strive for the complete victory of the resistance war, the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese People's Government are determined to vigorously mobilize the peasant masses in 1953 to thoroughly implement these land policies. The promulgation of the new land decrees will provide Vietnamese working farmers with a powerful weapon to fight against reactionary feudal landlords and ensure the implementation of the land policy.

    越南政府颁布新的土地政策法令
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南各报在五月二十日发表了越南民主共和国政府颁布的土地政策、在发动群众地区建立特别人民法庭和惩罚不服从法令的地主的各项新法令。
    新的土地政策法令包括减租减息，没收和分配法国殖民者、越奸和反动分子的土地，分配捐献的和公共的土地，处理不在地主的土地和私人的荒地等各项规定。
    越南在八月革命以前，全国百分之七十五的土地都掌握在法国殖民者和越南地主的手里，一千多万劳动农民没有一寸土地。八月革命胜利以后，越南民主共和国政府曾连续颁布了减租减息、没收法国殖民者和越奸的土地以及征收无主的土地，暂时分配给无地或少地的农民的各项法令。这些法令曾给五十多万农民带来了好处。但是由于反动地主和恶霸的抗拒和破坏，和有些地方政权机关执行得不够，土地政策没有得到全部贯彻。
    为了发动农民的力量、推动生产运动、争取抗战的完全胜利，越南劳动党和越南人民政府决心在一九五三年大力发动农民群众，彻底实现这些土地政策。新的土地法令的颁布，将给越南劳动农民带来和反动封建地主斗争的有力武器，保证土地政策的贯彻。
