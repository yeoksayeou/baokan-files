In recent months, forest fires have been occurring frequently in various places, destroying many trees. In fifty counties within the six special districts of Yanbei, Xinzhou, Yuci, Changzhi, Linfen, and Yuncheng in Shanxi Province, from late December of last winter to the end of April this year, a total of 187 mountain fire incidents occurred, burning more than 63,000 mu of barren mountains and forest land, and causing the loss of more than 160,000 trees of various sizes. In Fujian Province, incomplete statistics from November last year to the end of January this year showed that in the forestry areas of 44 counties, 210 fires occurred, burning more than 350,000 mu, accounting for 44 percent of the province's total afforestation area this year, and causing the loss of more than 528,000 trees. Among them, a single fire in Ningyang County in January this year burned more than 173,000 mu of trees. In Guangdong Province, statistics from only 34 counties including Boluo and Fogang last winter showed that 285 forest fires occurred, burning more than 2.4 million mu of trees. In Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, a forest fire broke out in Beixing Village on April 29 this year. Due to the failure to promptly block the fire, it spread to the Xin Kai Ling area in the territory of Aihui County. Chen Lei, Vice Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, and Liu Tingchun, County Head of Nenjiang County, led more than 40,000 people in fighting the fire day and night, and it was not completely extinguished until May 9. The burning area was more than 200 li long and more than 50 li at its widest point. In Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia, a wildfire occurred on April 28, destroying part of the trees and pastures. In addition, forest fires also frequently occur in mountainous and forest areas of Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces, destroying trees.

One of the reasons for the occurrence of forest fires is that leading cadres at all levels in some special districts, counties, and districts have not earnestly implemented the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on strictly preventing fires, and have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards forest protection work. For example, by the end of March in Fujian Province, the Fu'an Special Commissioner's Office and 25 key forestry counties such as Sanyuan and Wuping had not yet established forest protection headquarters. Although forest fire prevention organizations have been established in some areas, no one is specifically responsible, and they are merely a formality. Some leading organs have only issued calls and arrangements for forest fire prevention work, but have not conducted in-depth inspections and specific leadership, causing district and township cadres and the masses to not pay attention to forest protection work. Furthermore, some cadres who are indifferent to national wealth and people's lives neither actively organize the masses to fight fires when mountain fires break out, nor seriously deal with the aftermath after the mountain fires are extinguished, which has also allowed mountain fires to spread or increase.

The fundamental reason for the occurrence of forest fires is the failure to harness the enthusiasm of the masses for forest protection. The vast majority of mountain fires are caused by farmers burning thatch, burning field edges, burning field ridges, smoking, and drying fires, and the time of mountain fires is most frequent in winter and spring. This is because farmers in mountainous areas have the habit of "burning for cultivation" and "refining mountains." Burning thatch can fertilize the fields, and burning barren mountains can make the regenerated grass fertile and even. Some places simply use administrative orders to rigidly prohibit burning wasteland and closing mountains for afforestation, without taking into account the grazing of cattle and sheep by the masses, and without solving the practical problems in the production of the masses, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. In addition, some areas do not pay enough attention to the private ownership of mountains and forests by farmers, and some have nationalized the mountains that the masses were allocated in the land reform. In some areas of Shanxi, the masses were mobilized to contribute mountains when determining forest rights, and the "household mountain" of two brothers of a certain surname was taken as a "clan mountain" and nationalized (clan mountains should not be nationalized either). Some areas have not yet determined forest rights, and some mountains and forests, although owned by farmers, have various restrictions on logging and sales. These all violate the policy of protecting private property rights and greatly damage the enthusiasm of farmers for forest protection. The fact that there are more mountain fires within the passes than outside the passes is the reason.

To thoroughly carry out fire prevention and forest protection work, in addition to the attention of leading organs, it is necessary to study practical and feasible methods based on specific circumstances that do not hinder mass production and can achieve forest protection, protect farmers' private ownership of mountains and forests, and give full play to farmers' enthusiasm for forest protection. A mass-conscious forest protection movement must be formed in order to do a good job in forest protection.

    山西福建广东等省山火仍很严重
    没有发挥群众护林积极性是发生山火的根本原因
    近数月来，各地山林不断发生山火，烧毁林木甚多。山西省雁北、忻县、榆次、长治、临汾、运城等六个专区的五十个县中，自去冬十二月下旬至本年四月底止，共发生烧山事件一百八十七次，烧毁荒山和林地六万三千余亩，损失大小林木十六万余株。福建省从去年十一月到今年一月底的不完全统计，在四十四个县的林业地区，发生火灾二百一十次，烧毁面积三十五万多亩，占全省今年造林总面积的百分之四十四，损失林木五十二万八千多株。其中宁洋县今年一月一次火灾中就烧掉林木十七万三千多亩。广东去冬仅博罗、佛岗等三十四县的统计，即发生山火二百八十五起，烧毁林木二百四十多万亩。黑龙江省嫩江县北兴村在今年四月二十九日烧起山火，由于没能及时堵截火头，竟烧到瑷珲县境新开岭地区。经黑龙江省人民政府副主席陈雷和嫩江县县长刘廷春等率领四万余人日夜扑打，到五月九日才完全扑灭。燃烧地区长达二百余里，最宽处五十余里。内蒙古昭乌达盟在四月二十八日发生荒火，烧毁树木和牧场各一部。此外，河北、河南、安徽、江西等省山林地区也经常发生火患，毁坏林木。
    山火发生的原因之一，是一些专区、县、区各级领导干部没有认真贯彻中央人民政府政务院关于严防火灾的指示，对护林工作采取官僚主义的态度。如福建省到三月底止，还有福安专署和三元、武平等二十五个重点林区的县份没有建立护林指挥部。有些地区护林防火机构虽已成立，但没有专人负责，流于形式。有的领导机关对护林防火工作只作了号召和布置，但没有深入检查，具体领导，致使区乡干部和群众对护林工作不重视。更有些对国家财富和人民生活漠不关心的干部，在山火烧起时既不积极组织群众扑打，山火熄灭后又不严肃处理，这也使山火得以蔓延或增多。
    发生山火的根本原因是没有发挥群众的护林积极性。绝大部分的山火都是由于农民烧茅草、燎地边、烧田塍和吸烟、烘火等所引起，而山火的发生时间又以冬春为最多。这是因为山区农民有“烧垦”和“炼山”的习惯，烧了茅草可以肥田，烧了荒山可以使再生的草又肥又齐。有些地方单以行政命令硬性禁止烧荒和封山育林，不照顾群众放牧牛羊，不解决群众生产中的实际问题，引起群众不满。另有些地区对农民的山林私有权不够重视，有的把群众在土地改革中分到的山收归国有。山西有的地区在确定林权时动员群众献山，并把某姓兄弟两个的
    “户山”当做“族山”收归国有（族山也不应收归国有）。有些地区林权尚未确定，有些山林虽归农民所有，但在采伐和出售上又有种种限制。这些都违犯了保护私有权的政策，大大地损伤了农民的护林积极性。关内山火特别多于关外，就是这个道理。
    要彻底搞好防火护林工作，除领导机关重视外，更需根据具体情况研究出既不防碍群众生产又能达到保护林木的切实可行的办法，保护农民山林私有权，充分发挥农民护林积极性，必须形成群众自觉性的护林运动，才能做好护林工作。    （童德润、马永勋、张锦坡、程远宣、李云露、徐泽金、朱富长、焦旺林、人木、李兴北、潘心华、飞立、牟春荣）
