Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 29th: Large quantities of grain from the Northeast are continuously being transported inside the customs to support disaster-stricken areas in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces.

    To support the grain needs of disaster-stricken areas inside the customs, under the unified plan of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government, starting in early May, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, and Liaoxi provinces have been continuously sending trains loaded with grain to the disaster areas. By May 19th, the first batch of grain had been completely transported. The second batch of grain began to be shipped on the 23rd, and within just two days, 20% of the transportation plan was completed. The third and fourth batches of grain will be shipped out successively.

    [This Newspaper] News: Xuchang Prefecture and Xuchang City in Henan Province are actively organizing transportation forces to rapidly transport grain from various locations to the disaster areas.

    Most of the wheat in the areas under the jurisdiction of Xuchang Prefecture suffered frost damage this spring, and the spring famine situation is very serious, with farmers lacking food grain. In order to help the people overcome the disaster, the Central People's Government has transferred a large amount of grain from the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and other places to Xuchang to meet the food needs of farmers in the disaster areas. More than 600,000 catties of relief grain are transported to Xuchang from various places every day. In order to successfully complete the task of transferring grain to the disaster areas, Xuchang Prefecture has transferred more than 60 cadres with rich experience in transfer work and more than 70 workers to form a transfer team to receive grain in a planned and step-by-step manner. On May 5th, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Xuchang Prefectural Administration convened a meeting of county party secretaries, directors of grain bureaus, and managers of grain companies to explain the grain allocation tasks for May and specifically arrange the grain transfer work. After the meeting, the counties organized trucks to pick up grain at Xuchang Station according to the plan. The secretary and propaganda minister of the CPC Xuchang Prefectural Committee also personally organized a large number of vehicles to support the work of transporting grain and providing disaster relief. Xuchang City Transportation Company, Xuchang Joint Transportation Station, Xuchang South Station Grain Depot, Xuchang County Grain Bureau, and other units formed a grain receiving committee and established grain receiving stations, liaison groups, receiving and transportation groups, storage groups, accounting groups, handling groups, weighing groups, guard groups, and other institutions, and organized more than 700 handling workers to handle grain. At present, all employees of the Xuchang City Grain Receiving Committee are working hard to promptly distribute the grain transported from various places to the disaster areas.

    河南省许昌专区加紧向灾区转运粮食
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北区大批粮食源源进关，支援河南、安徽、江苏、山东等省受灾地区。
    为了支持关内受灾地区的粮食需要，在中央人民政府粮食部的统一计划下，从五月初旬开始，黑龙江、松江、吉林、辽东、辽西等省，即不断地有载满粮食的火车驶向灾区。到五月十九日，第一批粮食已经调运完毕。从二十三日开始，第二批粮食开始启运，仅两天中，即完成调运计划百分之二十。第三批和第四批粮食，即将陆续运出。
    【本报讯】河南省许昌专区和许昌市积极组织运输力量，将各地运来的粮食，迅速转运往灾区。
    许昌专区所属地区，今春大部分小麦遭受霜害，春荒情况十分严重，农民缺乏口粮。中央人民政府为了帮助人民战胜灾荒，从东北、内蒙古、山西、北京、天津、广州等地调运大批粮食前往许昌，供应灾区农民粮食的需要。每天从各地运到许昌的救灾粮食在六十万斤以上。为了很好地完成将粮食转运到灾区的任务，许昌专区抽调六十多名富有调运工作经验的干部和七十多名工人组成调运队伍，有计划有步骤地接运粮食。中共许昌地委与许昌专署在五月五日召集各县县委书记和粮食局局长、粮食公司经理举行会议，交代了五月份粮食调拨任务，并具体布置了粮食调运工作。会后，各县都按计划组织了大车到许昌车站接运粮食。中共许昌地委书记和宣传部长还亲自动手组织大批汽车支援运粮救灾工作。许昌市搬运公司、许昌联运站、许昌南站粮库、许昌县粮食局等单位，组成了粮食接运委员会，设立了接粮站、连络组、接运组、保管组、会计组、搬运组、过秤组、警卫组等机构，并组织了七百多名搬运工人搬运粮食。现在，许昌市粮食接运委员会全体职工正在紧张地把各地运来的粮食及时分送到灾区去。
