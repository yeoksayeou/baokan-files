Response of Shandong Huang County Qiangguo Iron Factory to the Unsuitable Waterwheels

    Letter from Shandong Laiyang Industrial Company Huang County Qiangguo Iron Factory: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on April 26th published a letter from reader Wang Zhijun, raising concerns about the waterwheels manufactured by our factory being unsuitable for most local farmers. We now reply to the situation as follows:

    In the second quarter of 1952, our factory processed and manufactured Liberation-style waterwheels with 3.5-inch pipes for the Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Agency. After the waterwheels were manufactured, they were loaned to farmers by the Provincial Cooperative General Agency. Soon, farmers in Huang County generally reported that the waterwheel pipes were too thick, and the livestock could not pull them. They requested the supply of 3-inch thick pipes. Our factory immediately studied this with the County Cooperative United Society and reported the masses' opinions to our direct superiors, requesting them to find a solution. However, in the fourth quarter of the same year, the Provincial Cooperative General Agency ordered waterwheels from our factory that still used 3.5-inch pipes (specifications and quality were uniformly designed by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry). When signing the contract, our factory had raised the opinion of changing to use a portion of 3-inch thick pipes. However, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry refused and instructed that the factory could not change the specifications without the other party's approval. In the first quarter of this year, the waterwheels left the factory and were allocated by the Provincial Cooperative General Agency to the County Cooperative for loan to farmers. Farmers again raised opinions to the factory, making us very embarrassed.

    During the spring plowing season, the farmers' demands for improving the waterwheels became even more urgent. Our factory contacted the Huang County Cooperative United Society several times, asking them to immediately request instructions from the Provincial General Agency for a solution. The Society made several requests for instructions and sent a special person to the province, but still did not receive a timely reply. As early as November 1952, our factory had asked Laiyang Industrial Company to forward a request to the Provincial Department of Industry, the Provincial Cooperative General Agency, and the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry to study how to resolve the farmers' demands. It was not until January of this year that Laiyang Industrial Company received instructions from the superiors, telling them to first conduct an in-depth understanding of how many farmers actually required 3-inch thick pipes. Laiyang Industrial Company immediately sent people to Huang County. The local County Party Committee and the People's Government attached great importance to this and vigorously assisted, conducting an investigation at the district and township cadre meetings. The results showed that farmers requiring 3-inch pipes accounted for approximately 70 percent. The Industrial Company immediately reported the statistical materials and the draft drawings for 3-inch pipes formulated by our factory to the superiors, but there was no reply for three or four months. Later, the Huang County People's Government instructed the County Cooperative United Society to once again request instructions from the Provincial Cooperative General Agency. It was not until April 20th that a telegram reply was finally received from the Provincial Cooperative General Agency, deciding to convert 300 of the last 500 ordered units to 3-inch pipes. Our factory has now converted 100 units, of which 42 units have been allocated to the County Cooperative for loan to farmers. All of them can be manufactured and shipped by May 20th. However, this still cannot meet the needs of the farmers. The County Cooperative has again requested instructions from the Provincial General Agency on whether the remaining 200 units can also be converted to 3-inch pipes, but a reply has not yet been received.

### 山东黄县强国铁工厂对所造水车不合需要的答复

    山东黄县强国铁工厂对所造水车不合需要的答复
    山东莱阳实业公司黄县强国铁工厂来信：四月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登读者王志俊来信，对我厂所造水车不适合当地大多数农民使用问题提出意见。现将情况答复如下：
    我厂一九五二年第二季度给山东省合作总社加工制造管子粗三吋半的解放式水车，水车制成后，由省合作总社出贷给农民。不久，黄县农民普遍反映：水车管子太粗，牲畜拉不动；要求供应三吋粗的管子。我厂当即与县合作社联合社研究，将群众意见汇报直属上级，要求设法解决。但同年第四季度省合作总社向我厂定制的水车仍用三吋半的管子（规格质量由省农林厅统一设计）。在签定合同时，我厂曾经提出意见，要求改用一部分三吋粗的管子。但农林厅拒绝了，并指示未经对方批准，工厂不能更改规格。今年第一季度水车出厂，由省合作总社拨付县社转贷给农民。农民又纷纷向工厂提出意见，使我们很为难。
    在春耕期间，农民对改进水车的要求更迫切了。我厂曾数次与黄县合作社联合社联系，让他们马上向省总社请示解决办法。该社为此曾数次请示，并派专人去省；但仍未得到及时批复。还在一九五二年十一月份时，我厂曾经请莱阳实业公司转呈省工业厅，与省合作总社、省农林厅研究如何解决农民要求；到今年一月，莱阳实业公司才接到上级指示，让先深入了解一下要求三吋粗管子的农民究竟有多少。莱阳实业公司立即派人到黄县，当地县委和人民政府对此很为重视，大力协助，在区乡干部会上作了调查，结果要求三吋管子的农民约占百分之七十。实业公司就立刻将统计材料和我厂制定三吋管子的草图汇报给上级，可是一直拖了三、四个月未有答复。后来经黄县人民政府又责成县合作社联合社再度请示省合作总社，到四月二十日总算接到省合作总社电复，决定把最后五百部定货中改制三百部三吋管子的。现在我厂已经改制了一百部，其中四十二部已拨付县社贷给农民；五月二十日前可全部制造出厂。但这还不能满足农民的需要，县社又请示省总社是否可将其余二百部也改制三吋管子的，但尚未得到批复。
