    Local People's Governments Should Educate Farmers to Properly Store Toxic Pesticides
    Yang Xixian from Huxi People's Hospital in Shandong Province writes: On March 30th, students at Dali Lou Village Elementary School in the Second District of Jinxiang County, Shandong Province, mistakenly mixed arsenic pesticide, thinking it was mung bean flour, into porridge, resulting in the unfortunate collective poisoning of fifty-eight people. After medical personnel were dispatched by the Shandong Provincial People's Government, the Huxi Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the Jinxiang County People's Government, and the Yutai County People's Government for rescue, fifty-six people have been brought out of danger, but the cook and one student unfortunately died. Four days after this incident, a farmer near Chengguan in the same county mistakenly mixed arsenic into gypsum to make tofu, resulting in the poisoning of five people who ate it; they are currently being rescued by the Jinxiang County Health Center. According to a doctor sent from Yutai County, the Yutai County Health Center rescued nearly one hundred people poisoned by arsenic in 1952 alone. Arsenic is a commonly used pesticide in various regions, and preventing accidental arsenic poisoning is indeed an important task. I suggest that local people's governments widely educate the masses to pay attention to this issue and establish a method for centralized storage of toxic pesticides. In addition, it would be best if the agencies that sell pesticides could dye the toxic pesticides that are easily confused with food, so that farmers can easily distinguish them.

    各地人民政府应该教育农民妥善保管有毒农药
    山东省湖西人民医院杨希贤来信：三月三十日，山东省金乡县第二区大李楼村小学学生误将农药白砒当绿豆粉而混入粥中，以致发生五十八人集体中毒的不幸事件。经山东省人民政府、湖西专署、金乡县人民政府和鱼台县人民政府派医务人员前往抢救，其中五十六人已转危为安，炊事员和学生各一人不幸死亡。这个事件发生后第四天，该县城关附近一家农民误将白砒混入石膏做豆腐，结果五人吃后中毒；现正由金乡县卫生院抢救中。据鱼台县派来的医生说：在一九五二年一年中，鱼台县卫生院抢救白砒中毒的人数就将近一百人。白砒是各地普遍使用的农药，防止误食白砒中毒事件的确是一件重要的工作。我建议各地人民政府广泛地教育群众注意这个问题，并建立集中保管有毒农药的办法。此外，发售农药的机关最好能将有毒而易与食物混同的农药染色，以使农民易于区别。
