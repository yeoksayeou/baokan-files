Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 20th: The expansion project of the state-owned Central South Electrical Factory is being intensified. According to the national plan, this factory will be expanded into a modernized factory within a few years. After the expansion project is completed, the output of various products of the factory will be greatly increased compared with the current output. Among them, the output of switches and transformers will be sixteen times higher than the output in 1952; the output of motors and generators will be twenty times higher than in 1952. The preparatory work for the expansion project has been started since the fourth quarter of last year. Last winter, the factory leadership transferred more than sixty technical personnel from the production department to strengthen the basic construction design organization. This spring, with the support of the local people's government, an engineering team of more than four hundred people was formed. At present, tens of thousands of square meters of expansion projects are being intensified. These projects include factories, dormitories, auditoriums, and technical school buildings. Next to the electrical factory, a wire factory with an area of approximately 15,000 square meters is also being newly built. This factory will be basically completed by the end of this year, and it will specialize in producing various wires needed by the electrical factory.

    中南电工厂加紧进行扩建工程
    【新华社长沙二十日电】国营中南电工厂的扩建工程正在加紧进行。按照国家的计划，这个厂在几年内要扩建成一个有现代化装备的工厂。扩建工程完成后，该厂各种产品的产量要比目前的产量提高很多。其中如开关、变压器的产量要比一九五二年的产量提高十六倍；电动机、发电机的产量要比一九五二年提高二十倍。扩建工程的准备工作，从去年第四季度起已开始进行。去年冬天，该厂领导方面从生产部门抽调出六十多个技术人员充实基本建设设计机构。今年春季，在当地人民政府的支援下，又组成了四百多人的工程队。现在，成万平方公尺的扩建工程正在加紧进行。在这些工程中，包括厂房、宿舍、礼堂、技工学校校舍等项目。在电工厂的旁边，也正新建一个面积约一万五千平方公尺的电线厂。这个厂在今年年底可基本建成，它将专门生产电工厂所需的各种电线。
