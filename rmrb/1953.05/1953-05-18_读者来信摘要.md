Reader Letters Summary
Oppose Complacency, Strengthen Confidentiality Work
—Commentary on Reader Letters

    Recently, we have received many reader letters reflecting the situation of certain organizations and cadres not valuing confidentiality work, and even the occurrence of incidents of leakage and loss of confidential information. Some organizations are irresponsible in their work of clearing confidential documents, and even sell confidential documents as waste paper. For example, comrades from the Xinxiang Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of the China Department Store wrote to reflect that when the former Pingyuan Provincial People's Government was abolished, it sold some internal reports and cadre appraisal forms of the Department of Commerce as waste paper. Fortunately, Comrade Zhu Xialing of the station discovered them at a waste paper dealer and spent money to buy them back. Some cadres carry confidential documents with them when they go out and do not pay attention to safekeeping, resulting in the loss of documents. For example, a staff member of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry lost the bureau's confidential document "Explanation of the Five-Year Construction Plan" in the Dong'an Market in Beijing. Fortunately, Li Xudong, a shop assistant and member of the Communist Youth League in a raw leather suitcase shop in the market, picked it up and sent it to the police station. Another example is Liu Yuman, secretary of the Communist Youth League Dongjiao District Committee in Beijing, who lost a small briefcase containing many confidential documents and organization access cards at the Youth Palace Cinema, and did not actively look for it until the Dongdan Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau notified him to pick it up. Some cadres casually discuss issues related to national secrets in public places. Readers have reported several times that they have heard staff members of certain government agencies or enterprises talking loudly about internal agency situations or military and political plans in barbershops, bathrooms, or on buses as if there was no one else around. In addition, some organizations lack strict receiving, dispatching, safekeeping, and inspection systems for internal publications, which often results in losses. For example, reader Yan Jian reflected that the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce checked the safekeeping of internal publications in its subordinate units in the previous period and found that the phenomenon of loss was very serious. For example, the Nanchang City Salt Company's Business Department lost eleven issues of internal publications in 1952.
    Since the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Maintaining State Secrets" in February 1950, our confidentiality work has made considerable achievements. However, the above-mentioned situations reflected by readers show that some organizations and cadres still have a rather serious sense of complacency and underestimation of the enemy, resulting in some shortcomings and loopholes in confidentiality work. The reason for this situation is that some leading cadres still lack due attention to confidentiality work. They have not regularly conducted strict confidentiality education for cadres, making cadres realize that maintaining state secrets is a regular and important political task; at the same time, they have relaxed the inspection and supervision of confidentiality work, and have not seriously dealt with and educated those staff members who violate the principles of confidentiality.
    The erroneous attitude of neglecting to maintain state secrets must be quickly corrected! It should be recognized that the greater the achievements of our country's construction, the more frantic the enemy's hostility and sabotage activities will be. Today, our country is carrying out large-scale construction work, and the enemy is doing everything possible to use all kinds of despicable and shameless means in an attempt to steal our country's secrets and undermine our construction cause. If we are negligent, we will give the enemy an opportunity to exploit, which may cause huge losses to the country. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of leakage and loss of secrets, leading organs in various regions should further strengthen the leadership of confidentiality work, strengthen confidentiality education for cadres, so that they can raise their vigilance, eliminate complacency, and consciously maintain state secrets; at the same time, they must also strengthen inspection, and promptly discover and plug loopholes in the current confidentiality work. For serious leakage and loss of secret incidents that have already occurred, relevant leading organs should conduct serious handling to educate all staff members.

More than 100 Tons of Lime Transported by the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee School to Wuchang Became Waste

    Yang Chongming from the Business Section of the Wuchang Branch of the Wuhan Transportation Company wrote: The Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee School does not cherish state property, causing more than 100 tons of lime to become waste.
    In April 1952, Pei Xusheng, a cadre from the school's production department, escorted twenty carloads of lime to Wuchang Railway Station. Fifteen carloads were sold at that time, and five carloads (more than 100 tons) remained unsold. Because the lime was placed at the station and required overdue fees, the school negotiated with the local public security organs and temporarily stacked the lime in an open space at Dadongmen. Workers from the Fifth Service Station's carriage team of our Wuchang Transportation Branch transported the lime from the railway station to the open space, and the transportation fee was more than 2.04 million yuan. Pei Xusheng said at the time that he would pay the next day, but he did not do so afterwards. After our workers sent a letter to the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee School to inquire, the wages were not collected until March of this year. However, more than 100 tons of lime were placed in the open space, and after nearly a year of wind and rain, they have completely become waste and are worthless. Calculated at the current market price, this batch of lime has caused a loss of 48 million yuan in state property. The school's behavior of not cherishing state property should be criticized.

The East China Construction Engineering Bureau Fails to Fulfill the Contract, Causing Great Losses to the Yixing County Cooperative

    Zheng Feng from the Yixing County Cooperative Federation in Jiangsu Province wrote: The East China Construction Engineering Bureau and the Promotion Section of the Yixing County Cooperative Federation signed a lime purchase and sales contract in the fourth quarter of 1952, stipulating that the two parties would trade 90,000 dan of lime in the first quarter of 1953. However, the East China Construction Engineering Bureau did not effectively fulfill this contract, and only purchased about 60% of the lime specified in the contract during the stipulated period. In February and March, they did not arrive in Shanghai on time to unload the goods according to the contract date. The delay was as long as 23 days, and the shortest was also eight days. According to incomplete statistics, 132 ships transporting lime to Shanghai were delayed due to untimely unloading in the past two months, with an average delay of about 15 days per ship, and this expenditure was over 100 million yuan.
    The East China Construction Engineering Bureau's failure to fulfill the contract has disrupted the production plan and business plan of the Yixing County Cooperative Federation. For example, the production of two lime-operating production cooperatives in Yixing County cannot be carried out according to plan, but can only be carried out according to the bureau's notification.
    In order not to affect the national basic construction, the cooperative must reserve raw materials and fuels according to the quantity of the contract, but the lime is delayed after being transported to Shanghai, and the accounts cannot be settled in time; more than 5.5 billion yuan of funds are accumulated. In this way, the cooperative is heavily in arrears with the state bank, and the production cooperative cannot pay for the purchase of coal from the local Coal Industry Building Materials Company as scheduled.
    It is hoped that the East China Construction Engineering Bureau will conduct an in-depth inspection of this matter and make appropriate handling.

The Use of an Electric Steelmaking Furnace in the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory is Unreasonable

    Zhou Junhe and Li Chuanxi wrote: The Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory (a joint state-private enterprise, under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Textile Industry) has an automatically controlled electric steelmaking furnace. However, this factory produces looms, and the demand for steel is not large, and the quality requirements are not high. Therefore, this furnace for producing high-quality steel is now used to produce ordinary steel materials. This not only reduces the country's production of more than 4,000 tons of high-quality steel every year, but also increases the factory's steelmaking costs. At the same time, the steel ingots produced by this electric steelmaking furnace exceed the factory's actual needs; and the factory does not have steel ingot processing equipment, and the steel ingots must be sent outside for processing into steel before they can be used by the manufacturing department. Therefore, on the one hand, a large number of steel ingots produced by the steelmaking workshop have been accumulated for a long time. At one time, there were more than 400 tons of qualified steel ingots accumulated, of which more than 50 tons were pressed for two and a half years; on the other hand, the factory's manufacturing department often purchases 30% of the steel from outside and still cannot avoid work stoppages waiting for materials. In addition, the factory has specially equipped a steelmaking engineer, three technicians, and many laboratory personnel for this steelmaking furnace. We believe that if this electric steelmaking furnace is handed over to the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, so that it can undertake the task of producing high-quality steel; and the steel required by the factory is ordered from the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, all losses can be avoided.

Why Has the Problem of Adding a Lathe in the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau Not Been Solved for a Long Time?

    Lu Yuan wrote: In the second half of 1951, the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau needed to add an electric lathe due to work needs. At that time, with the approval of the Central South Post and Telecommunications Administration Bureau, the lathe was ordered by the bureau, and the budget could be added to a certain project in 1951. In May 1952, the Central South Post and Telecommunications Administration Bureau notified that the quality of the ordered lathe was poor, and it was negotiating to return the goods. The budget should be removed from a certain project settlement; the purchase of the lathe should be reported separately. In early July, the Hunan Post and Telecommunications Administration Bureau submitted the preliminary design and technical design, and the Central South Post and Telecommunications Administration Bureau agreed and instructed that the appropriation should be included in the fourth quarter. Until mid-November, the year was about to end, and the lathe had not yet been allocated. The Hunan Post and Telecommunications Administration Bureau repeatedly urged the allocation, and they telegraphed back saying: "The goods can only be delivered at the end of February 1953." But the year has passed, and the budget must be carried over. The end of February has passed, and the lathe has not arrived yet. This financial budget has been changed to the second quarter of this year. In this way, the Hunan Post and Telecommunications Administration Bureau has done the fourth investigation and survey report, technical design, and request for funds report, but whether the lathe can be issued at that time is still unknown.
    It took more than a year to add a lathe, with more than 20 official documents back and forth, and four reports on budget, design, and annual carry-over, and 160 to 170 sheets of paper have been used; but there is still no result. What is the reason? We don't know. But our work has suffered losses as a result, and manpower and material resources have been wasted.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    反对麻痹思想加强保密工作
    ——读者来信述评
    最近我们接到不少读者来信，反映某些机关和干部不重视保密工作，甚至发生泄密、失密事件的情况。有些机关对机密文件的清理工作不负责任，甚至把机密文件当废纸出卖了。如中国百货公司新乡采购供应批发站的同志来信反映：原平原省人民政府在机构撤销时把商业厅的一些内部报告和干部鉴定表等密件当废纸出卖，幸被该站朱遐龄同志在废纸商处发现，才花钱买了回来。有些干部随便带着机密文件外出，并且又不注意保管，以致发生丢失文件的事件。如中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局的一个工作人员竟将该局的机密文件“五年建设计划的说明”在北京市东安市场内丢失，幸被市场内有生皮箱行店员、青年团员李旭东拾到，送给了派出所。又如青年团北京市东郊区工作委员会书记刘玉满竟将一个放着很多机密文件和机关出入证的小皮包丢失在青年宫电影院，并且不积极寻找，直到北京市公安局东单分局通知他后才来取走。有一些干部在公共场合随便谈论有关国家机密的问题。读者反映他们在理发室、浴室或公共汽车上听到某些政府机关或企业部门的工作人员旁若无人地大谈机关内部情况或军政大计的来信就有好几件。此外，有一些机关对内部刊物缺乏严格的收发、保管、检查制度，因而也常发生丢失。如读者严剑反映：江西省人民政府商业厅在前一时期检查了所属各单位保管内部刊物的情况，发现丢失现象很严重，如南昌市盐业公司营业部在一九五二年内就丢失了十一期内部刊物。
    自一九五○年二月中央人民政府政务院发布了
    “关于保守国家机密的指示”以来，我们的保密工作有了不少成绩。但是，读者反映的以上情况说明，目前我们有些机关和干部还有着相当严重的麻痹轻敌思想，致使保密工作还存在一些缺点和漏洞。产生这种情况的原因，是某些领导干部对保密工作还缺乏应有的重视，他们没有经常对干部进行严格的保密教育，使干部们认识保守国家机密是一件经常而重要的政治任务；同时也放松了对保密工作的检查、督促，对于那些违反保密原则的工作人员又不严肃处理和认真教育。
    忽视保守国家机密的错误态度必须迅速纠正！应该认识：我们祖国建设的成就愈大，敌人对我们的仇视和破坏活动也就愈加疯狂。今天，我们的国家正在进行大规模的建设工作，敌人更是千方百计地用各种卑鄙无耻的手段，企图窃取我们国家的机密，破坏我们的建设事业。如果我们麻痹大意，就会使敌人有空子可钻，就可能给国家造成巨大的损失。为了杜绝失密、泄密现象，各地领导机关应该进一步加强对保密工作的领导，加强对干部的保密教育，使他们提高警惕，清除麻痹思想，自觉地保守国家机密；同时，还必须加强检查，及时发现和堵塞目前保密工作中的漏洞。对已经发生的严重泄密、失密事件，有关领导机关应该进行严肃的处理，以教育全体工作人员。
    中共新乡地委党校运到武昌的一百多吨石灰变成了废物
    武汉市搬运公司武昌分公司业务股杨重明来信：中共新乡地委党校不爱护国家财产，使一百多吨石灰变成废物。
    一九五二年四月，该校机关生产部干部裴绪生押运了二十车皮石灰到武昌车站，当时卖了十五车皮，还剩五个车皮（计一百多吨）没有卖出去。因为石灰放在车站要付延期费，该校就向当地公安机关交涉后把石灰暂时堆放在大东门口一个空旷地上。我们武昌搬运分公司第五服务站马车队工人替他们把石灰由火车站转到空地，搬运工资二百零四万余元，裴绪生当时说第二天就付，但以后并没有照办。经我们工人去信到中共新乡地委党校催问，直到今年三月才把工资催来。但是这一百多吨石灰放在空地上，经将近一年风吹雨淋，已完全变成废物，一钱不值了。若按目前的市价计算，这批石灰共使国家财产损失四千八百万元。该校这种不爱护国家财产的行为应该受到批评。
    华东建筑工程局不履行合同宜兴县合作社工作大受损失
    江苏省宜兴县合作总社郑枫来信：华东建筑工程局与宜兴县合作总社推销股在一九五二年第四季度签订了石灰购销合同，规定双方在一九五三年第一季度交易石灰九万公担。但是华东建筑工程局并不切实履行这个合同，在规定时期内仅购买占合同规定数量百分之六十左右的石灰。而在二、三两个月中，他们没有一次是按合同规定日期到上海及时卸货，延搁时间长者达二十三天，最少也有八天。根据不完全的统计，两个月来共有一百三十二只船运石灰到上海去时因卸货不及时而被延搁，平均每只船被搁十五天左右，这笔支出就在一亿元以上。
    华东建筑工程局这种不履行合同的作法，搞垮了宜兴县合作总社的生产计划和经营计划。如宜兴县两个经营石灰的生产合作社因此生产不能按计划进行，而只能按该局通知来进行。
    合作社为了不影响国家基本建设，必须根据合同的数量储备原料和燃料，而石灰运到上海后却被延搁，不能及时结账；共积压资金五十五亿元以上。这样，合作社大量拖欠国家银行的资金，生产合作社向当地煤业建筑器材公司购买煤块也不能如期付款。
    希望华东建筑工程局深入检查这件事情，并作适当处理。
    上海中国纺织机器厂的一座电气炼钢炉使用不合理
    周钧禾、李传栻来信：上海中国纺织机器厂（公私合营，属中央纺织工业部领导）有一座自动控制的电气炼钢炉。但这个厂是生产织布机的，钢的需要量并不多，质量要求也不高，因此这座炼优质钢的炉，现在被用作生产普通钢料。这不但使国家每年少生产四千多吨优质钢，而且也增加了该厂制钢成本。同时这座电气炼钢炉所产钢锭超过该厂实际需要；而该厂又没有钢锭加工设备，还需把钢锭送到外面加工制成钢材后才能供制造部门应用。因此，一方面，炼钢工场生产出来的大量钢锭长期积压，有一个时期积压合格品的钢锭达四百多吨，其中有五十多吨压了两年半；另一方面，该厂制造部门经常外购百分之三十的钢材还不能免于停工待料。此外，该厂为了这个炼钢炉又特别配备了一个炼钢工程师、三个技术员和很多化验人员。我们认为：如果把这个电气炼钢炉交给钢铁工业局，使它担任生产优质钢的任务；而该厂所需的钢材向钢铁工业局订购，一切损失就都可以避免。
    长沙电信局增添车床的问题为什么长期没有解决
    陆远来信：长沙电信局在一九五一年下半年由于工作需要，须添一部电动车床。当时经中南邮电管理局批准，车床由该局负责订购，预算可以在一九五一年某工程内追加。到了一九五二年五月间，中南邮电管理局却又通知说：订购的车床品质欠佳，正交涉退货中，该项预算应在某工程决算内剔除；购车床事要另行呈报。七月初，湖南邮电管理局即将初步设计和技术设计呈报上去，中南邮电管理局同意并指示将该项用款列入第四季度内。直到十一月中旬，年度即将终了，车床仍未拨到。湖南邮电管理局一再催拨，他们又来电说：“须于一九五三年二月底始可交货。”但年度已过，预算又须结转。二月底已经过去了，车床还未到来，此项财务预算又改到本年第二季度。这样湖南邮电管理局做了第四次的调查勘察报告、技术设计、请款报告等，但到时车床是否可以发下，还不知道。
    要增添一部车床，经过一年多的时间，往返公文二十余次，办理预算、设计和年度结转的表报四次，表纸已用去一百六七十张；但却仍无结果。这究竟是什么原因呢？我们不知道。但我们的工作却因此遭受了损失，并且浪费了人力和物力。
