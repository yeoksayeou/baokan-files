(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th) Our correspondent reports: On the night of May 2nd, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Yuyin Mountain front captured an enemy hilltop position east of Yandonggou, annihilating an entire company and four heavy machine gun platoons of the defending enemy, the Li pseudo-army's 7th Division.

That afternoon, before the attacking troops set out, the delegation of the Fatherland People's Comfort Group to Korea, which had just arrived at the Yuyin Mountain front to offer their condolences, specially sent representatives to the attacking troops' positions, bringing many letters of condolence and commemorative badges to the fully armed soldiers. This greatly inspired the soldiers.

As darkness fell, the attacking troops advanced towards the enemy's position under the cover of night. After our artillery bombarded the enemy's position fiercely, Wang Deshan, the platoon leader of the assault platoon, shouted: "Comrades! The representatives of the people of the motherland are waiting for news of victory, we must annihilate the enemy completely!" The assault team bravely charged up the mountain. In just two minutes, they captured the enemy's forward position. Then, the soldiers engaged in fierce close combat with the enemy entrenched in bunkers in the enemy's formation.

Soldiers Zheng Guorong and Wang Tianlu attacked a group of enemy bunkers. Wang Tianlu fired at the enemy with his rifle, and Zheng Guorong threw grenades into the bunkers. They destroyed enemies in six bunkers in a row, and also destroyed a bunker storing ammunition.

More than twenty enemies could not withstand the brave attacks of our soldiers and fled into tunnels. Machine gunner Liu Zhengrong took his machine gun and fired into the tunnels, killing all the enemies inside.

Communist Party member Qin Zhan’ao was wounded in the head and arm, but still charged at the front. An enemy heavy machine gun was firing at our attacking troops, so Qin Zhan'ao endured the pain and threw a grenade at it. Then, taking advantage of the thick smoke from the explosion, he rushed up and snatched the enemy's heavy machine gun from the firing port. Together with two other wounded soldiers, he continuously took down thirteen bunkers and eliminated more than thirty enemies.

The fierce battle lasted for half an hour, and an entire company and four heavy machine gun platoons of the defending enemy Li pseudo-army's 7th Division were completely annihilated.

After the battle, the soldiers happily said: We used fewer troops than the enemy to fight them, and we can annihilate them completely; but when the enemy uses ten times as many troops as us to attack us, they can't even touch the edge of our forward fortifications. We are fighting better and better, and the enemy is getting worse and worse!

    鱼隐山我军半小时歼敌一个连四个机枪班
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】本社记者报道：五月二日夜，鱼隐山前线的中国人民志愿军某部攻占了岩洞沟以东敌军的一个山头阵地，歼灭守敌李伪军第七师一个整连及四个重机枪班。
    这天下午，攻击部队出发之前，刚赶到鱼隐山前线进行慰问的祖国人民赴朝慰问文艺工作团，特别派遣代表到攻击部队的阵地上，把许多封慰问信和纪念章带给整装待发的战士们。这给战士们带来很大的鼓舞。
    天黑时，攻击部队在夜幕的掩护下向敌人阵地进发。当我军炮火向敌人阵地施行猛烈的轰击以后，突击排排长王德山高喊着：“同志们！祖国人民的代表正等着胜利消息，我们一定要全歼敌人！”突击队员们勇猛地向山上冲去。只两分钟，他们就攻占了敌人的前沿阵地，接着，战士们就深入敌阵和据守地堡的敌人展开了激烈的近战。
    战士郑国荣、王天禄两个人攻打敌人的一处地堡群。王天禄用步枪向敌人射击，郑国荣就向地堡里面扔手榴弹。他们一连消灭了六个地堡里的敌人，还炸毁了一座储存弹药的地堡。
    有二十多个敌人经不住我军战士的勇猛攻击，逃进坑道。机枪射手刘正荣端着机枪就向坑道里射击，将敌人全部射死在坑道里。
    共产党员秦占鳌的头上和手臂都负了伤，仍然冲在最前面。敌人有一挺重机枪正向我攻击部队射击，秦占鳌忍着疼痛打过去一颗手榴弹。接着，他趁着爆炸的浓烟冲上去，把敌人的重机枪从射击口里夺出来。他和另外两个负伤的战士在一起，连续打下十三个地堡，消灭了三十多个敌人。
    激烈的战斗进行了半个小时，守敌李伪军第七师的一个整连、四个重机枪班被全部歼灭。
    战后，战士们高兴地说：我们用比敌人少的兵力打敌人，能把它全部歼灭；可是，敌人用十倍于我的兵力攻我们，却连前沿工事的边也摸不到。我们越打越漂亮，敌人越打越糟糕了！
