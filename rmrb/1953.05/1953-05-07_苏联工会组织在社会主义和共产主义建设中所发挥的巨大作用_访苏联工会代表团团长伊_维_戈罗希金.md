    We often say, "The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow." We not only follow every development and achievement of the Soviet state with great concern, but also learn from the Soviet Union's experience with boundless enthusiasm, using it as a guide for our progress. Now, our country has entered a new period of national planned economic construction, and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is summarizing past experiences and formulating the guiding principles and tasks of the trade union in this great historical period. The past and present experiences of Soviet trade union organizations are of great significance to us. This reporter interviewed Comrade I.V. Goroshkin, head of the Soviet trade union delegation who came to our country to participate in the "May Day" celebration and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and asked him to talk about the great role of Soviet trade unions in socialist and communist construction.

    Comrade Goroshkin first reviewed with us the historical background of the Soviet Union when it began to implement the first five-year plan: Russia suffered from the destruction of the First Imperialist World War, and after the victory of the October Revolution, it experienced domestic wars and armed intervention. Therefore, the newborn Soviet state faced many economic difficulties. However, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, all Soviet people made great efforts to heal the wounds of the war, restore the devastated national economy, and began to lead the country to a new historical stage—implementing the reconstruction of the entire national economy, and transforming the Soviet Union from a poor and weak agricultural country into a rich and powerful industrialized country. This was the task of the first five-year plan for socialist construction from 1928 to 1933. Comrade Goroshkin said: "It was not easy to complete such a major task. We not only faced economic and technical difficulties such as a lack of funds and technical personnel, but also had to fight against opportunists inside and outside the party. This struggle was also reflected within the trade union organization. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the trade union smashed all kinds of opportunism, purged elements hostile to the Soviet state and the Soviet regime, greatly strengthened the power of the working class, and guaranteed the early and over-fulfillment of the five-year plan, the construction of heavy industry, the development of collectivized agriculture, and laid the foundation for the final elimination of the exploitation system."

    After the first five-year plan began to be implemented, the central task of the Soviet trade union was to mobilize all workers to actively invest all their strength in the high tide of construction. The trade union put forward the slogan of "completing the five-year plan," mobilized workers to launch a shock socialist competition movement, put forward competition conditions, set their own goals of struggle based on the national plan, and guaranteed their completion. The trade union also vigorously supported various new initiatives of the workers; at the same time, it launched criticism and self-criticism, opposed bureaucracy that hindered the creativity and enthusiasm of the workers, and made the workers' production enthusiasm unprecedentedly high, setting off a labor upsurge in participating in socialist construction.

    At that time, the Soviet trade union not only played a role in organizing workers to participate in production in cities, in industry, transportation, and infrastructure, but also carried out work in the socialist reform of rural areas. The trade union organized workers to go to the countryside to help farmers establish collective farms, help collective farmers produce, and carry out political propaganda and mobilization, as well as auxiliary work such as improving agricultural tools.

    In 1931, Comrade Stalin pointed out the various difficulties existing in the Soviet Union's economic construction process at that time, and the trade union did its best to help overcome these difficulties. For example, regarding the issue of labor, at that time, with the rapid development of industry, the phenomenon of unemployment was eliminated; the organization of collective production in rural areas also ended the phenomenon of farmers flowing into cities, so it was necessary to systematically recruit workers to supply the needs of industry, and at the same time mechanize production. The task of the trade union, in addition to assisting in the organized recruitment of workers, was also to strive to help eliminate the mobility of labor, so that workers could be fixed in certain production, in order to learn to master complex production technologies. In this regard, the trade union helped various enterprises and departments formulate correct wage standards, solve workers' food and housing problems, eliminate egalitarianism, and improve workers' material and cultural life. At the same time, the trade union had to conduct extensive explanation and education work to the workers, so that they could understand that improving productivity was to improve the workers' living standards, so that the workers were concerned about improving labor productivity, improving the quality of products, eliminating the phenomenon of no one being responsible, establishing a responsibility system, and improving the organization of labor. Another example is the issue of training technical cadres. Comrade Stalin pointed out in 1929: "In the current period of industrial technological transformation, the cadre issue is precisely the issue that determines everything in socialist construction." At the beginning of the implementation of the first five-year plan, many old technical intellectuals openly or secretly opposed the Soviet regime, so there was a great lack of engineering and technical personnel and industrial commanders in the construction. The working class must quickly cultivate its own intellectuals and technical cadres. In the work of training cadres, the trade union played a great role. On the one hand, it established various crash training courses to train a large number of cadres, and on the other hand, it sent thousands of worker-peasant cadres to universities for further study. At the same time, the trade union also paid attention to taking care of the old technical intellectuals who worked loyally and whose thinking had changed, so that they could be correctly used and serve the construction work. Comrade Goroshkin summarized: "The task of our trade union is to actively participate in the work of completing the five-year plan ahead of schedule. The successful completion of the first five-year plan enabled us to create huge industrial departments that had never existed before, such as the ferrous metallurgy industry, the automobile manufacturing industry, the machine manufacturing industry, the modern chemical industry, the aviation industry, and the tractor manufacturing industry, laying the foundation for the mechanization of agriculture. The defense capabilities of the Soviet state were also strengthened accordingly. At the same time, we eliminated unemployment, and the number of employees increased greatly. In 1933, the number of employees in the heavy industry sector doubled compared to 1928. The lives of workers have also been improved. The average annual increase in workers' wages was 67 percent; the social insurance expenditure in 1928 was 1.05 billion rubles, and in 1932 it increased to 4.12 billion rubles." Comrade Goroshkin especially reminded us: "The Soviet Union's first five-year plan and subsequent five-year plans were all personally led, formulated and implemented by Comrade Stalin. Every Soviet citizen knows deeply that all the achievements of the Soviet Union in the past 30 years are inseparable from Stalin's wise leadership. It was Stalin who led us from victory to victory."

    Comrade Goroshkin turned the topic to the role of Soviet trade union organizations in today's communist construction period, and he briefly described how Soviet trade unions mobilize and organize the vast number of workers to participate in communist construction, and how to lead workers to promote advanced production experience. He said: "Now all Soviet workers are striving to complete the fifth five-year plan, and the work of the trade union is completely subordinate to this great goal. The central task of the trade union is to organize socialist competition, formulate nationwide competition conditions, check the results of the competition, and identify advanced enterprises, and strive to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule." He also listed several examples of the trade union's specific leadership: the trade union committees of various factories and mines are using great efforts to conduct extensive education work among employees, helping them to understand the significance of conducting competition and recognize what kind of production tasks should be completed and what indicators should be achieved, and understand that not only should output be increased, but production costs should also be reduced. Another task is to help employees formulate competition conditions based on actual conditions, help them check the implementation of the plan and complete the competition plan: such as promoting advanced experience, organizing learning, helping skilled advanced workers to train apprentices, and using various propaganda tools to carry out propaganda and mobilization, in order to encourage workers' production enthusiasm. In the entire competition process, the trade union must also pay attention to helping the relatively backward workers catch up with the advanced workers at any time. The specific method is to improve the workers' skills by organizing Stakhanov schools and technical training classes. In addition, it is also necessary to constantly help workers put forward new initiatives and improve tools, and improve production technology. In the past two years, employees in various industrial sectors of the Soviet Union have had nearly 1.5 million inventions and rationalization proposals. Comrade Goroshkin especially emphasized: an important link in the competition is the work of summarizing and promoting advanced production experience. The trade union must use various propaganda tools to promptly publicize the experience of advanced producers and organize workers to learn. He said: "Socialist competition guarantees the improvement of labor rate and the improvement of production quality, which greatly contributes to the completion of the production plan. It has become a powerful tool for the entire people to build communism. Due to the successful unfolding of socialist competition, the Soviet people have successfully completed the fourth five-year plan for socialist construction, and the two-year plan of the fifth five-year plan has also been successfully completed."

    Comrade Goroshkin also talked about how Soviet trade unions care about workers' lives and welfare, and how the living standards of Soviet workers are constantly improving. He said: "The characteristics and requirements of the socialist basic economic law are to use the method of continuously increasing and improving socialist production on the basis of high technology to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. All activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government revolve around this goal; the main task of the trade union is also to help employees improve their living standards, first of all to improve working conditions and improve labor productivity. Increasing production can also increase wages and improve workers' lives." Along with the development of heavy industry, the Soviet Union's various civilian light industries are also constantly developing. The daily consumer goods enjoyed by the entire Soviet working people in 1952 were more than the total amount in the five years of the first five-year plan. With the development of production, the Soviet Union has gradually reduced the prices of industrial products and food since 1947. April 1 this year was the sixth price reduction. The price reductions time and time again have undoubtedly greatly increased the actual income of workers and farmers and continuously improved their lives. The workers' housing problem has also received great attention from the party and the government. Since the Second World War, the Soviet Union has built more than 155 million square meters of workers' housing in cities and workers' residential areas, and more than 3.8 million houses in agricultural areas. In the construction of workers' housing, the trade union used great efforts to assist in promoting construction and supervising distribution work. In formulating wage standards, improving labor insurance and technical safety equipment, and conducting cultural and educational activities for employees, the Soviet trade union also played a great role. Comrade Goroshkin said: "Since the successful completion of the first five-year plan and the elimination of unemployment, the ranks of workers have expanded year by year, and improving the lives of workers has become an important task of the trade union."

    The Soviet trade union also pays great attention to the work of conducting internationalist education for workers. Comrade Goroshkin said: "In the cultural and educational activities of cultural palaces and clubs in Soviet factories, trade unions often organize lectures and reports to explain the activities and development of Chinese working people in various aspects. Trade union newspapers and periodicals also often publish the labor life and achievements of Chinese workers. The trade union actively supports the government's measures to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship by all means. Soviet workers are infinitely concerned about the work and achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects. They firmly believe that the strengthening of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a powerful guarantee for world peace and the improvement of the lives of working people all over the world." He finally said: "I am very honored to come to China to participate in the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions this time. I hope that the congress will proceed smoothly, further improve the work of the trade union, mobilize the broad masses of people to participate in and complete the task of large-scale industrial and agricultural construction. I believe that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will surely be able to unite the workers of the whole country around the heroic Chinese Communist Party and the long-tested Chairman Mao Zedong, and strive to build an industrialized motherland!"

    苏联工会组织在社会主义和共产主义建设中所发挥的巨大作用
    ——访苏联工会代表团团长伊·维·戈罗希金
    本报记者　谭文瑞
    我们常常说：“苏联的今天就是我们的明天。”我们不仅以极大的关怀注视着苏维埃国家的每一项发展和成就，并且怀着无限的热情学习苏联的经验，作为我们前进的指南。现在，我国已开始进入国家有计划的经济建设的新时期，中国工会第七次全国代表大会正在总结过去的经验和制定工会在这伟大的历史时期中的方针和任务。苏联工会组织昨天的和今天的经验，对于我们都有着重大意义。记者访问了前来我国参加庆祝“五一”大会和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的苏联工会代表团团长伊·维·戈罗希金同志，请他谈谈苏联工会在社会主义和共产主义建设中所发挥的巨大作用。
    戈罗希金同志首先和我们重温了一下苏联在开始实行第一个五年计划时的历史背景：俄国遭受了第
    一次帝国主义世界大战的破坏，十月革命胜利后又经历了国内战争和武装干涉，因而新生的苏维埃国家面对着许多经济上的困难。但是全体苏维埃人民在布尔什维克党的领导下以巨大的努力医治了战争的创伤，恢复了备遭破坏的国民经济，开始把国家引上新的历史阶段——实行整个国民经济的改建，把苏联由一个贫弱的农业国家变成为富强的工业化的国家。这就是一九二八年至一九三三年的社会主义建设第一个五年计划的任务。戈罗希金同志说：“要完成这样一个重大的任务不是容易的事情，我们不仅面对着缺乏资金和技术人员等经济上和技术上的困难，而且还要与党内党外的机会主义分子进行斗争。这种斗争也反映在工会组织的内部。工会在布尔什维克党的领导下，粉碎了各种机会主义，肃清了敌视苏维埃国家和苏维埃政权的分子，大大加强了工人阶级的力量，保证了五年计划的提前和超额完成，建设了重工业，发展了集体化的农业，奠定了最后消灭剥削制度的基础。”
    第一个五年计划开始执行后，苏联工会的中心任务就是动员全体工人积极地以全部力量投入建设的高潮。工会提出了“完成五年计划”的口号，动员工人展开突击社会主义竞赛运动，提出竞赛条件，根据国家的计划而订出自己奋斗的目标并保证其完成。工会并大力支持工人们的各种新创议；同时展开批评与自我批评，反对障碍工人创造性与积极性的官僚主义，使工人们生产热情空前提高，掀起了参加社会主义建设的劳动热潮。
    苏联的工会当时不仅在城市里，在工业、运输业、基本建设中起了组织工人参加生产的作用，而且在农村的社会主义改革中也进行了工作。工会组织工人到农村去帮助农民成立集体农庄，帮助集体农民生产，和进行政治宣传鼓动及改良农具等辅助工作。
    一九三一年斯大林同志指出了苏联当时在进行经济建设过程中所存在的各种困难，工会就曾尽了全部力量帮助克服这些困难。例如关于劳动力的问题，当时随着工业的飞速发展，失业现象消灭了；农村组织了集体的生产，农民自流入城的现象也告终止，因此必须有组织地吸收工人来供应工业的需要，同时把生产机械化。工会的任务除了协助有组织地招收工人外，还要努力帮助消灭劳动力的流动性，使工人固定在一定的生产中，以便学会掌握复杂的生产技术。在这方面，工会帮助各企业部门制订正确的工资标准，解决工人的饮食、居住问题，消灭平均主义，改善工人的物质和文化生活。工会同时要向工人进行广泛的解释教育工作，使他们认识提高生产率就是为了提高工人的生活水平，使工人们关心提高劳动生产率，改善产品的质量，消灭无人负责现象，建立负责制，改善了劳动的组织。又如培养技术干部的问题，斯大林同志在一九二九年就指出：“而在现今工业技术改造时期，干部问题正是社会主义建设中决定一切的问题。”在开始执行第一个五年计划的时候，许多旧技术知识分子是公开或暗中反对苏维埃政权的，因此在建设当中大感缺乏工程技术人员和工业指挥人员。工人阶级必须迅速培养自己的知识分子和技术干部。在培养干部的工作中，工会起了很大的作用，它一方面成立各种速成训练班培养大批干部，另一方面把成千成万的工农干部送到大学去深造。同时工会并注意照顾忠心工作和思想转变了的旧技术知识分子，使他们可以得到正确的使用，为建设工作服务。戈罗希金同志总括起来说：“我们工会的任务就是积极参加提早完成五年计划的工作。第一个五年计划的胜利完成，使我们创立了从前所没有的黑色金属冶炼业，汽车制造业，机器制造业，现代化学工业，航空工业，拖拉机制造业等巨大工业部门，奠定了农业机械化的基础。苏维埃国家的国防力量也随之而加强了。同时，我们消灭了失业现象，就业人数大大增加，一九三三年重工业部门的职工人数比一九二八年增加了一倍。工人的生活也获得了改善，职工工资每年平均增加百分之六十七；一九二八年的社会保险事业费共十亿五千万卢布，一九三二年便增加到四十一亿二千万卢布。”戈罗希金同志特别提醒我们：“苏联第一个五年计划和以后的几个五年计划，都是斯大林同志亲自领导制订和实现的。每一个苏维埃公民都深深知道，苏联三十年来的一切成就，都是与斯大林的英明领导分不开的。是斯大林领导着我们从胜利走向胜利。”
    戈罗希金同志把话题转到苏联工会组织在今天共产主义建设时期中的作用，他简要地叙述了苏联工会如何动员和组织广大工人参加共产主义建设，以及如何领导工人推广先进生产经验。他说：“现在苏联所有的工人全力为完成第五个五年计划而奋斗，工会的工作也就完全服从这一伟大的目的。工会的中心任务是组织社会主义竞赛，制订全苏的竞赛条件，检查竞赛的结果，确定先进的企业，为提前完成本年度的计划而努力。”他并列举了工会进行具体领导的几个例子：各厂矿的工会委员会，以很大的力量在职工中进行广泛的教育工作，帮助他们了解进行竞赛的意义和认识应该完成那样的生产任务与达到那些指标，明白不仅要提高产量，而且要降低生产成本。另外一项任务，就是帮助职工根据实际情况订立竞赛条件，帮助他们检查计划的执行情况以及完成竞赛计划：如推广先进经验，组织学习，帮助熟练的先进工人带徒弟，和利用各种宣传工具进行宣传鼓动，以鼓舞工人的生产热情。在整个竞赛过程中，工会并且要随时注意帮助比较落后的工人赶上先进的工人，具体的作法就是通过组织斯大哈诺夫学校和技术训练班等来提高工人的技术。此外并要经常帮助工人提出新的创议和改良工具，改进生产技术。苏联各工业部门的职工最近两年就有了将近一百五十万件的发明与合理化建议。戈罗希金同志特别强调：在竞赛当中一个重要的环节是总结和推广先进生产经验工作。工会必须利用各种宣传工具及时宣传先进生产者的经验和组织工人们学习。他说：“社会主义竞赛保证了劳动率的提高和生产质量的提高，大大有助于生产计划的完成，它已成为全民建设共产主义的有力工具。由于成功地展开了社会主义竞赛，苏联人民已顺利完成了第四个社会主义建设五年计划，第五个五年计划的两年计划也已顺利完成了。”
    戈罗希金同志还谈到苏联工会如何关怀工人的生活和福利，以及苏联工人生活水平不断提高的情形。他说：“社会主义基本经济法则的特点和要求就是用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。苏联共产党和苏维埃政府的一切活动都是围绕这一目的的；工会的主要任务也是帮助职工提高生活水平，首先是改善劳动条件，提高劳动生产率。增加了生产，也就可以提高工资，改善工人的生活。”与重工业发展的同时，苏联的各种民用轻工业也不断在发展。苏联全体劳动人民一九五二年一年中所享用的日用消费品便比第一个五年计划时的五年的总数量还多。随着生产的发展，苏联从一九四七年起逐步降低工业品与食品的价格，今年四月一日已是第六次减低物价了，物价一次又一次的降低，无疑地也就大大提高了工人和农民的实际收入，不断改善了他们的生活。工人的居住问题也受到党和政府的极大关怀。第二次世界大战以后，苏联在城市和工人住宅区修建了面积一亿五千五百多万平方公尺的工人住宅，在农业区建筑了三百八十多万幢以上的房子。在修建工人住宅中，工会以很大力量来协助推动建设和监督分配工作。在制订工资标准，改善劳动保险和技术安全设备，对职工进行文化教育活动等各方面的工作，苏联工会也起了很大的作用。戈罗希金同志说：“自从第一个五年计划胜利完成，消灭了失业现象之后，工人的队伍逐年扩大，改善工人生活便成为工会的重要任务了。”
    苏联工会同时很注意对工人进行国际主义教育的工作，戈罗希金同志说：“在苏联各工厂中的文化宫、俱乐部的文教活动中，工会经常组织演讲和报告，向工人们讲解中国劳动人民各方面的活动和发展，工会的报刊也经常刊载中国工人的劳动生活和成就。工会用一切的办法积极支持政府加强中苏友谊的措施。苏联工人对中国人民各方面的工作和成就是无限关怀的，他们坚信中苏两国人民友谊的加强是世界和平和全世界劳动人民生活改善的强大保证。”他最后表示：“我这次到中国来参加中国工会第七次全国代表大会，感到很荣幸。希望大会顺利进行，进一步改进工会的工作，动员广大的人民参加并完成大规模工农业建设的任务。相信中国总工会一定能够把全国工人团结在英勇的中国共产党和久经考验的毛泽东主席周围，为建设工业化的祖国而奋斗！”
