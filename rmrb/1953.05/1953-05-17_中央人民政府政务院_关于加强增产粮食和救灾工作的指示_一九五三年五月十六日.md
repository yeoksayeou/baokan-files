    Instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government
    on Strengthening Grain Production and Disaster Relief Work
    May 16, 1953

    1. Increasing grain production is the primary task in agricultural production work. In 1952, China's grain output had already exceeded the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan level, but we must never be satisfied with this level. With the development of national economic construction and the increase in urban and industrial populations, the demand for grain supply has increased. In rural areas, due to the improvement of the lives of the vast number of farmers and herdsmen after land reform, the demand for grain has also increased. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the production of more grain to meet the needs of the country and the people, and there must be a certain amount of grain reserves to cope with possible difficulties and ensure the smooth progress of the country's industrialization construction.

    Since last winter, major wheat-producing provinces such as Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi have successively suffered from disasters such as cold waves or late frosts, insects, and hail, resulting in reduced wheat production in many areas, and some early spring crops (broad beans, peas, etc.) have also suffered losses. The spring drought in some northern regions has not yet been relieved, and timely sowing of autumn crops is still difficult. In some areas south of the Yangtze River, continuous rain has caused seedling rot. These situations indicate that this year's task of increasing grain production is arduous and there are many difficulties, but the difficulties in grain production can be overcome. Because the victory of land reform has greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers for production; the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement has increased the possibility of overcoming disasters and exploiting the potential of agricultural production; the largest proportion of China's total grain crop output is rice and miscellaneous grains, and the losses suffered by wheat can be compensated for from autumn grains; the wheat that suffered frost damage has partially tillered and grown after rescue, and losses can be reduced by strengthening wheat field management; the policy on the price ratio of cotton and grain and other cash crops was promptly announced in April this year, making the area of cash crops relatively stable, and the enthusiasm of the masses to increase grain production has increased accordingly; in addition, the state is providing huge economic assistance to farmers, and the leadership of party and government organs at all levels in agricultural production is also being strengthened; all these favorable conditions indicate that as long as we can make the greatest and best efforts to lead farmers to overcome natural disasters and increase grain production, the task can still be accomplished.

    2. "Saving wheat and ensuring autumn" is the basic requirement of current grain production work, and it is also the basic requirement of current disaster relief work in disaster-stricken areas. All wheat-producing areas must seize the opportunity to make efforts in many ways to rescue wheat seedlings and reduce losses. At the same time, everything possible should be done to ensure the timely sowing of autumn crops, ensure full seedlings and normal growth, and strive to increase the production of autumn crops. Wheat and rice are China's main commercial grains, with rice accounting for 41.6% of the country's total grain output, while various miscellaneous grains such as millet, corn, sorghum, and potatoes are the main food grains for the vast number of farmers, accounting for more than 40% of the total grain output, and their disaster resistance performance is strong and it is easy to obtain a bumper harvest, and their straw can be used as feed and fuel. Therefore, it is necessary to lead the masses to comprehensively increase the yield per unit area of various grain crops according to local natural conditions.

    For cotton, the new cotton-grain price ratio standard stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council should be correctly publicized to farmers, striving to increase the yield per unit area, and should not be blindly expanded again, but should not be excessively reduced.

    3. In order to accomplish the task of increasing grain production in 1953, the following basic links must be firmly grasped:

    (1) Universally and deeply mobilize and organize the masses to fight against natural disasters. In areas where wheat has suffered frost damage, in addition to watering and topdressing, timely rescue is required. Wheat fields that have suffered too much damage must be interplanted with autumn crops as soon as possible to strive for more harvests. In areas where spring sowing has not yet been completed, it is necessary to overcome all difficulties in manpower and material resources, and make full use of the experience of seizing moisture, borrowing moisture, and drought-resistant sowing to complete the sowing of autumn crops in a timely manner. In areas south of the Yangtze River where rice seedlings are rotting, experience in preserving seedlings should be promoted to cultivate strong seedlings as much as possible and complete transplanting work in a timely manner. In areas where insect pests have occurred and are about to occur, the spirit of "early treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment" should be conscientiously grasped, and medicines and machinery should be supplied in a timely manner to organize the masses to actively prevent and control them. For areas where locusts have been harmful for years, it is necessary to implement forecasting and early warning, effectively grasp the insect situation, and organize the masses to thoroughly eliminate them in a timely manner. In order to alleviate this year's drought, all localities should actively organize the masses on the principle of voluntary participation, make full use of existing water conservancy facilities, improve irrigation efficiency, and, where necessary and possible, lead the masses to build mass agricultural water conservancy projects, add various water absorption tools, and expand the irrigation area according to local conditions. In low-lying and rainy areas, organize the masses to drain water immediately to prevent and reduce waterlogging. For floods, vigilance should be heightened at all times, and the instructions recently issued by the Central Flood Control Headquarters should be resolutely implemented to strive to reduce the disaster-affected area. This year, the climate is out of balance, and disasters such as drought, flood, wind, insects, and hail may occur from time to time. All localities must study the laws of local natural disasters, prepare in advance, vigorously publicize to the masses, and take all necessary and feasible preventive measures so that even if disasters occur, they can be rescued in time and disasters can be prevented from expanding.

    (2) Guide and help farmers to solve the difficulties of production materials in a timely manner. At present, spring plowing and sowing in most areas are nearing completion. Because the work of accumulating fertilizer last winter was relatively relaxed, and wheat-affected areas need topdressing, it is necessary to actively organize farmers to accumulate manure in large quantities, make compost, and apply green manure, so that accumulating fertilizer, increasing fertilizer, and applying fertilizer reasonably and in a timely manner become the conscious actions of farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives should not stop doing something for fear of a minor problem when correcting the shortcomings in the supply of commercial fertilizers in the past. They should still supply commercial fertilizers according to the different needs of farmers in various places and sell them to farmers at prices not higher than the market price to make up for the shortage of manure. The work of protecting draft animals must be strengthened, especially in disaster areas. In addition to actively preventing and controlling epidemics, it is necessary to solve the problem of livestock feed and improve feeding management methods. The problem of seed shortage in disaster-stricken areas should be resolved quickly, and reserve seeds should be stored in a planned way. The raw materials needed to replenish agricultural implements should be quickly allocated by relevant departments according to the actual needs of various places. Local banks should distribute agricultural loans according to the needs of farmers' production in appropriate proportions and distribute them in a timely manner. Cooperation and trade departments should strive to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and actively help farmers open up sales channels for local and special products to increase farmers' investment and reproduction capacity. The relevant departments of people's governments at all levels should closely cooperate to solve the problems of supplying production materials and solving farmers' production difficulties practically and in a timely manner, so as not to delay agricultural time. Farmers in disaster areas have more production difficulties and should pay special attention to vigorously supporting them; only by helping disaster victims to do a good job in production can we stabilize the emotions of disaster victims, shorten the time of famine and difficulties, and overcome the famine.

    (3) Strive to improve farming techniques. Due to different natural conditions and crop types in various places, agricultural technology has great regionality. For the advanced farming techniques and cultivation methods that are effective in the production of local farmers, cadres should go deep into the masses to discover, summarize and improve them realistically, and gradually promote them according to local conditions. In the work of improving agricultural technology, subjectivism must be opposed. The practice of mechanically transporting methods regardless of local conditions is wrong and will inevitably suffer failure. But it is not to say that the mature experience that was suitable for local farming in the past should also be abandoned and not used, and to relax the various tasks that we should do, must do, and may do in improving agricultural technology. This conservative thinking is also wrong. In the work of promoting successful local farming techniques and striving to increase grain production, local state-owned farms and agricultural experiment stations must play a leading and exemplary role, and closely combine with agricultural technology guidance stations to help local farmers study and improve farming techniques. The agricultural departments of county and district people's governments should use agricultural gaps to use various methods to conduct seasonal technical training for rural cadres, backbones of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and production activists among farmers. From sowing to autumn harvest, all localities must grasp the main links of farming in each season and conscientiously do a good job in technical guidance.

    4. Cadres of people's governments at all levels in disaster-stricken areas are absolutely not allowed to be indifferent to the disaster situation, but they should not panic. They must have firm confidence and lead the masses to overcome the famine. We must make production and disaster relief work the overriding central task at present. All tasks that are not related to production and disaster relief should be stopped if they should be stopped, and slowed down if they should be slowed down. We must concentrate all our efforts to lead the people in the disaster areas to overcome natural disasters, tide over the spring famine, and prepare for the summer famine. The Central People's Government has increased this year's disaster relief grain and funds and is transporting grain to the disaster areas. The civil affairs departments at all levels should correctly grasp the existing disaster relief grain and funds, distribute them appropriately, distribute them in a timely manner, and help the disaster victims to produce and save themselves. People's governments at all levels in disaster-stricken areas should help the disaster-stricken masses to seize the opportunity to rescue wheat seedlings, complete spring sowing, and, on the premise of not delaying farming, organize them to engage in sideline production with conditions and sales channels, and urge trade and cooperation departments to make special efforts to find sales channels for local special products in disaster areas. Call on the people in the disaster areas to universally use the gaps to plant early-maturing and high-yielding crops such as melons, vegetables, and potatoes, and collect wild vegetables and other substitute foods for consumption during the period before the autumn harvest when there is no food to eat. Among the people in the disaster areas, free borrowing and lending, mutual assistance and mutual relief should also be promoted to tide over the famine. In disaster areas where the supply of commercial grain is relatively tight, relevant departments should be urged to effectively grasp the grain market situation, strictly manage the market, prevent hoarding and speculation, and do a good job in transportation and supply to stabilize the people's production emotions. The organs and troops in the disaster areas should share weal and woe with the people, advocate eating coarse grains, and implement saving disaster relief to be close to the local people. For loans due this summer that disaster-stricken households are unable to repay, the National Bank should allow them to be postponed. For severely affected farmers, it is necessary to implement reductions and exemptions and convert them into relief.

    5. The guarantee for completing the task of increasing grain production is to concentrate efforts to strengthen the leadership of grain production, earnestly implement the people's government's various policies for developing agricultural production, and better educate farmers to increase their enthusiasm for production. To this end, we must conscientiously implement the policy of protecting farmers' land ownership, implement the agricultural tax policy of reasonable burden, tax reduction and exemption according to law, and no tax increase for increased production, steadily develop the policy of mutual assistance and cooperation, and appropriately reward labor models. This year's focus on rewarding agricultural labor models should be on encouraging increased grain production. Strengthening the ideological education of district and township cadres must make the work tasks, policy boundaries, and work methods clear to the cadres so that they can fully play an active role in leading agricultural production. For some district and township cadres who have developed a tendency of not daring to lead production in the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion and commandism, and violation of laws and disciplines, and for some village cadres who are afraid of delaying work and suffering losses in their own production, and are therefore unwilling to lead production, we must help them solve practical difficulties on the one hand, and strengthen their education on the other hand. Each prefecture and county must plan to grasp the base points, check more, understand the situation in a timely manner, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and educate cadres with living experience to drive the overall situation, so that the above-mentioned disaster relief work and various measures to increase grain production can be carried out in an organized manner and implemented.

    The task of increasing grain production in 1953 is arduous, and the current work of saving wheat, ensuring autumn, and disaster relief is urgent. Party and government leading organs and people's organizations at all levels should seize the opportunity, mobilize, and strive to overcome natural disasters, increase grain production, and ensure the smooth progress of the country's economic plan construction.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强增产粮食和救灾工作的指示
    一九五三年五月十六日
    一
    增产粮食是农业生产工作中的首要任务。一九五二年我国的粮食产量已经超过抗日战争前的水平，但我们绝不能满足于这个水平。随着国家经济建设的发展，城市人口和工业人口的增加，粮食供应的要求增大了，而在农村，由于土地改革后，广大农牧民生活的改善，粮食需要量也增加了；因此，必须增产更多的粮食，以满足国家和人民的需要，还必须有一定的粮食储备，以应付可能发生的困难，保证国家工业化建设的顺利进行。
    去冬以来，安徽、江苏、河南、山东、山西等主要产麦省份，先后遭受寒流或晚霜、虫、雹等灾害，不少地区小麦减产，某些早春作物（蚕豆、豌豆等）亦已遭受损失。北方部分地区春旱尚未解除，大秋作物及时播种，尚有困难。长江以南部分地区，又因阴雨连绵，发生烂秧现象。这些情况说明了今年增产粮食的任务是艰巨的，困难是很多的，但粮食增产的困难，是可以克服的。因为土地改革的胜利，大大提高了农民生产的积极性；农业互助合作运动的发展，增加了战胜灾害发挥农业生产潜力的可能性；我国粮食作物总产量中，比重最大的是水稻和杂粮，麦子遭受的损失，还可从秋粮中求得弥补；遭受冻害的小麦，经过抢救以后，部分已分蘖生长，只要加强麦田管理，还可减少损失；今年四月间又及时公布了棉粮及其他经济作物的比价政策，使经济作物面积相对稳定下来，群众增产粮食的积极性随之提高；加以国家对农民正在进行巨大的经济援助，各级党政机关对农业生产的领导亦正在加强；这一切有利条件，都指明了只要我们能够尽最大最善的努力，领导农民战胜灾荒、增产粮食的任务，仍然是可以完成的。
    二
    “救麦保秋”是当前粮食生产工作的基本要求，也是受灾地区当前救灾工作的基本要求。各产麦区必须抓紧时机，从多方面努力，抢救麦苗，减少损失。同时，应尽一切可能保证大秋作物的及时播种，确保全苗和正常生长，力争大秋作物的增产。小麦和水稻是我国主要的商品粮食，水稻占全国粮食总产量百分之四十一·六，而小米、玉米、高粱和薯类等各种杂粮，又是广大农民的主要食粮，占粮食总产量的百分之四十以上，且其抗灾性能较强，容易获得丰收，其秸秆又可充作饲料与燃料。因此必须根据各地自然条件，领导群众全面地增加各种粮食作物的单位面积产量。
    对于棉花，应向农民正确地宣传政务院财政经济委员会规定的新的棉粮比价标准，力求提高单位面积产量，而不应再盲目扩大，但也不应过分缩小种植面积。
    三
    为了完成一九五三年的粮食增产任务，必须紧紧掌握下列几个基本环节：
    （一）普遍深入地动员和组织群众与自然灾害作斗争。小麦遭受霜害地区，除了浇水追肥，及时抢救外，受灾过重的麦田并须及早间种大秋作物，争取多收。在目前春播尚未完成的地区，要克服一切人力物力困难，充分利用抢墒、借墒、抗旱播种的经验，及时完成大秋作物的播种工作。在南方水稻发生烂秧地区，应推广保秧经验，尽可能地培育壮秧，适时完成栽秧工作。在虫害业已发生和将要发生的地区，应认真掌握“及早治、连续治、彻底治”的精神，并及时供应药械，组织群众积极防治。对蝗虫历年为害的地区，必须实行预测预报，切实掌握虫情，适时地组织群众彻底扑灭。为了减轻今年的旱灾，各地应在群众的自愿原则下，积极组织群众，充分利用现有的水利设备，提高灌溉效能；并在需要与可能的条件下领导群众，因地制宜地兴办群众性的农田水利，增添各种吸水工具，扩大灌溉面积。在低洼多雨地区，即时组织群众排水，防止与减轻内涝。对于洪水，应随时提高警惕，坚决执行最近中央防汛总指挥部发布的指示，争取减少成灾面积。今年气候失调，旱、涝、风、虫、雹等灾，时有发生的可能，各地均须研究当地自然灾害的规律，事先做好准备，大力向群众宣传，采取各项必要与可行的预防措施，即令灾害发生，亦能及时抢救，不使灾害扩大。
    （二）指导与帮助农民，及时解决生产资料的困难。目前大部地区春耕春播将近结束，由于去冬积肥工作比较放松，小麦受灾地区又需追肥，故必须积极组织农民大量增积厩肥，制造堆肥，沤压绿肥，使积肥、增肥与适时合理施肥，成为农民的自觉行动。供销合作社在纠正过去供应商品肥料工作中的缺点时，不得因噎废食，仍应根据各地农民之不同的需要，供应商品肥料，以不高于市场的价格出售给农民，以补厩肥之不足。保护耕畜的工作，必须加强，特别是灾区，除积极防治疫病外，必须解决牲畜饲料和改善饲养管理方法。受灾地区目前缺少种籽问题应予迅速解决，并须有计划地储存备荒种籽。增补农具所需的原料，应由有关部门按各地实际需要迅速调拨。各地银行应根据农民生产的需要，按照适当比例分配农贷并及时发放下去。合作、贸易部门应努力加强城乡物资交流，积极帮助农民打开土特产品的销路，以增加农民投资再生产的力量。对供应生产资料及解决农民生产困难等问题，各级人民政府的有关部门应密切协同，切实及时解决，以免贻误农时。灾区农民的生产困难更多，更应特别注意，大力扶助；只有帮助灾民搞好生产，才能安定灾民情绪，缩短灾荒困难时间，渡过灾荒。
    （三）努力改进耕作技术。由于各地自然条件和作物种类不同，农业技术有着极大的地域性。对于当地农民在生产中行之有效的先进耕作技术与栽培方法，应由干部深入群众中去发现，实事求是地加以总结提高，并因地制宜地逐步推广。在改进农业技术的工作中，必须反对主观主义。不顾当地条件，机械搬运的作法，是错误的，必然要遭受失败的。但不是说把过去适合于当地农作的成熟经验也弃而不用，放松我们在改进农业技术方面应当做、必须做以及可能做的各项工作。这种保守思想也是错误的。在推广当地成功的农作技术努力增产粮食的工作中，各地国营农场和农事试验场，必须起带头示范作用，并与农业技术指导站密切结合，帮助当地农民研究改进农作技术的方法。县区人民政府的农业部门，应利用农隙，采用各种方式对农村干部、互助合作组织的骨干和农民中的生产积极分子，进行季节性的技术传授工作。从播种至秋收，各地必须抓住各个季节农作上的主要环节，认真作好技术指导工作。
    四
    受灾地区各级人民政府干部，在灾情面前，绝不允许麻木不仁，但也不要惊慌失措，要有坚定的信心，带领群众，战胜灾荒；要将生产救灾工作，做为当前压倒一切的中心任务。凡与生产救灾无关的各项工作，该停则停，该缓则缓，切实集中全力领导灾区人民战胜自然灾害，渡过春荒，并作好预防夏荒的准备。中央人民政府业已增加今年的救灾粮款，并正向灾区调运粮食，各级民政部门应正确掌握现有救灾粮款，适当分配，适时发放，扶助灾民，生产自救。受灾地区各级人民政府应帮助受灾群众不失时机地抢救麦苗，完成春播，并在不误农作的前提下，组织他们进行有条件有销路的副业生产，督促贸易合作部门特别努力为灾区的土副特产品寻找销路。号召灾区人民普遍利用隙地多种早熟的和多产的作物如瓜、菜、薯类等并收集野菜等代食品，以备秋收前青黄不接时食用。在灾区人民中，还应提倡自由借贷，有借有还，互助互济，渡过灾荒。在商品粮食供应情况比较紧张的灾区，应督促有关部门切实掌握粮食市场情况，严格管理市场，制止囤积居奇、投机捣乱，作好调运供应工作，以安定人民生产情绪。灾区的机关部队应与人民同甘苦，提倡吃粗粮，并实行节约救灾，以亲密与当地人民的联系。国家银行对于受灾户在今年夏收时到期无力归还的贷款，应允许延期归还，对受灾严重的农户，更须实行减免，转作救济。
    五
    完成粮食增产任务的保证，是集中力量加强对粮食生产的领导，认真贯彻人民政府发展农业生产的各项政策，更好地教育农民，提高其增产的积极性。为此，必须认真贯彻保护农民土地所有权的政策，实行合理负担、依法减免、增产不增税的农业税收政策，稳步地发展互助合作的政策和适当奖励劳动模范的政策等。今年奖励农业劳动模范的重点，应放在鼓励增产粮食方面。加强区乡干部的思想教育，必须将工作任务、政策界限和工作方法向干部交代清楚，使能在领导农业生产方面充分发挥积极作用。对于部分区乡干部在反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪的斗争中，发生不敢领导生产的偏向，以及部分乡村干部怕误工，自己生产受损失，因而不愿领导生产的现象，必须一方面帮助他们解决实际困难，一方面加强对他们的教育。各专区、县必须有计划地掌握基点，多多检查，及时了解情况，及时发现与解决问题，以活的经验教育干部，带动全盘，务使上述救灾工作与增产粮食的各项措施，都能有组织地进行，并获得贯彻。
    一九五三年粮食增产的任务是艰巨的，当前救麦保秋和救灾工作是紧迫的，各级党政领导机关及人民团体，应抓紧时机，动员起来，为战胜灾荒、增产粮食、保证国家经济计划建设的顺利进行而奋斗。
