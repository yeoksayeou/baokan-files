    [Report from our Chongqing Press Station] The spring famine in the disaster areas of Southwest China has basically been overcome, with a summer famine appearing in some areas. Local leading organs are actively leading farmers in production and self-relief to prevent and overcome the summer famine. Since the beginning of spring this year, some areas of Southwest China have continuously experienced natural disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, insects, and wind. After the disasters occurred, Party and government leading organs at all levels took emergency measures to carry out production and disaster relief. The People's Governments of Xikang and Guizhou provinces regarded production and disaster relief as the overriding central task, vigorously organizing the people in disaster areas for production and self-relief. Many leading cadres in various regions went deep into the disaster areas to provide specific leadership, which powerfully promoted production and disaster relief work. So far this year, the entire Southwest region has distributed a total of 63 billion yuan in relief grain and funds, as well as a large amount of agricultural production loans. State-owned trade departments and cooperatives have also strengthened the purchase of local and special products in disaster-stricken areas. Thanks to the above-mentioned measures taken by various regions and the earnest implementation of the "production and self-relief" policy, the spring famine has basically been overcome in most areas.
    Recently, more than 70 counties in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have suffered from disasters such as wind, hail, floods, and snow. Droughts have also occurred in some areas, which has not only reduced the yield of spring crops in some areas but also affected the timely planting and growth of autumn crops this year. In addition, a summer famine has emerged in some areas. In the Ba Liu District (high mountain area) of Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, 45% of the population is currently out of food. During the spring famine in Yuanjiang County, there were fewer than 9,000 disaster victims, but during the summer famine, 30,000 people will be out of food. Currently, the leading organs in these disaster-stricken areas are leading farmers in production and self-relief, mobilizing the masses to rush plant, replant, and support seedlings, repair field ridges and ponds, and increase the distribution of relief grain and funds and loans, in order to prevent and overcome the summer famine and ensure the smooth progress of the major spring production.
    The main problems in the production and disaster relief work in various regions are: some regions have not investigated the disaster situation, resulting in panic when the disaster occurs; some rely solely on the higher authorities to allocate relief funds, ignoring the leadership of the masses in production and self-relief; some regions' banks, cooperatives and other relevant departments have not closely cooperated, so that farmers cannot buy food and means of production (mainly fertilizer) after receiving loans and relief funds; some regions' disaster-stricken farmers have a large number of local and special products in their hands; and there are also inappropriate distribution and serious accumulation of relief grain funds and loans.
    After the spring famine has been basically overcome, leading cadres in various parts of the Southwest region should overcome complacency and complacency, go deep to find out the true disaster situation, lead the masses to prevent and overcome the summer famine, specifically help solve various difficulties, strengthen guidance on production technology, and strive to complete this year's task of increasing grain production.

### 西南受灾地区春荒基本渡过  应进一步领导农民生产自救、防止和克服夏荒

    西南受灾地区春荒基本渡过
    应进一步领导农民生产自救、防止和克服夏荒
    【本报重庆记者站报道】西南受灾地区春荒已基本渡过，部分地区夏荒露头，各地领导机关正积极领导农民生产自救防止和克服夏荒。西南部分地区由于今年入春以来，不断发生水、旱、雹、虫、风等自然灾害，灾情发生后，各地党、政领导机关都采取了紧急措施，进行生产救灾。西康、贵州省人民政府把生产救灾作为压倒一切的中心任务，大力组织灾区人民生产自救。许多地区的领导干部都深入灾区具体领导，有力地推动了生产救灾工作。今年西南全区至目前为止，共发放了救济粮款六百三十亿元，和大量的农业生产贷款，国营贸易部门和合作社也加强了受灾地区的土、特产品收购工作。由于各地先后采取了上述措施，认真贯彻了“生产自救”的方针，目前大部地区春荒已基本渡过。
    近来四川、贵州及云南等省又有七十多个县发生了风、雹、水、雪等灾害，部分地区又发生旱象，这不仅造成了部分地区小春作物的减产，而且也影响了今年大秋作物的及时栽插和成长。另外有些地区夏荒已露头。云南省墨江县坝溜区（高山地带）目前已有百分之四十五的人口断粮；元江县春荒期间灾民不到九千人，夏荒期间将有三万人断粮。现在这些发生灾害的地区的领导机关，正领导农民生产自救，发动群众抢种、补种、扶苗，整修田坎和堰塘，并增发救济粮款和贷款，为防止和克服夏荒，保证大春生产的顺利进行而努力。
    各地在生产救灾工作中主要的问题是：有的地区对灾情没有摸底，以致在灾荒发生时惊慌失措；有的则单纯依赖上级拨救济款，忽视领导群众生产自救；有的地区银行、合作社等有关部门没有密切配合，以致发放贷款和救济款后，农民还买不到粮食和生产资料（主要是肥料）；有的地区受灾农民手中滞存大批土、特产品；救济粮款和贷款也有发放不当和严重积压等现象。
    在春荒基本渡过后，西南区各地领导干部应克服麻痹自满情绪，深入摸清灾情底细，领导群众防止和克服夏荒，具体帮助解决各种困难，加强对生产技术的指导，为完成今年增产粮食的任务而努力。
