How We Learn and Apply the Experience of Factory 53
Representative to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
Secretary of the CPC Committee of Shenyang Smelting Plant, Wei Wenfeng

Starting from reality and combining with the current central work is the key to learning and applying the experience of Factory 53.

Our learning of the experience of Factory 53 began with grasping the organized study under the leadership of the Party, in order to unify thinking and work pace.

Since July 1951, we have organized cadre studies, which have persisted until now. Two years of experience have proven that organizing cadre studies and unifying thinking is a necessary step in carrying out work. For example, when the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement was first launched in 1951, there were differences of opinion among the cadres: some workshop cadres had some concerns in their minds, fearing that the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement would dilute the Quality Inspection Movement. Therefore, they proposed the suggestion of "concluding the quality inspection first, and then concentrating efforts on the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement." However, the Party committee and factory leadership believed that the two could be combined. The Party committee and the factory director pointed out that for the smelting industry, the key to quality inspection lies in improving the actual recovery rate, reducing the grade of returned products, and improving product quality. And this is precisely what we must fully resolve in increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, doing a good job in quality is increasing production and practicing economy, and the two are inseparable. After repeated discussions, the cadres' thinking gradually became clear. In order to further unify thinking, we also studied the summary report of Gao Gang, Chairman of the former Northeast People's Government, at the Urban Work Conference, and the report of Wang Heshou, Minister of the Industrial Department of the former Northeast People's Government, "Striving to Improve Quality." This dispelled the ideological concerns of some cadres who "feared that the two could not be combined." On the basis of unified thinking, the specific steps for carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement were determined. The same is true in the work of promoting advanced experience. At the beginning, some cadres had insufficient understanding of advanced experience, believing that advanced experience was just a matter of luck. Some workshop cadres believed that promoting advanced experience was a matter for the factory leaders, and the workshops could not manage it. Therefore, we earnestly led everyone to study documents, conduct discussions and criticisms, so that everyone clearly recognized that vigorously promoting advanced production experience is the main method to complete the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan. We also used the advanced operating experience of Jiao Changxiang from the roasting workshop as an example to illustrate the importance of promoting advanced experience. At that time, Jiao Changxiang's lump rate reached 80% to 82%, while others only reached about 72%. If this experience were promoted to the entire workshop, so that each furnace could generally reach a lump rate of 82%, there would be confidence in completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy. Jiao Changxiang's example educated the cadres and cleared the obstacles to promoting advanced experience.

This year, when discussing the national plan, we not only organized the study of workshop-level cadres (including section chiefs, full-time Party and mass cadres), but also promoted this method to the workshop, so that workshop foreman-level cadres (including union and Party and Youth League group leaders and activists, advanced workers) could also unify their thinking and clarify the key through study. This form of study is somewhat different from the study of factory-level cadres. The workshops are convened in the form of an enlarged meeting of the Party branch after a central task is assigned, rather than on a regular basis. This year, the specific practice of the lead electrolysis workshop when discussing the national plan was: First, an enlarged meeting of the Party branch was held in the workshop, and administrative team leaders, union and Youth League group leaders and above cadres, activists, and advanced workers were invited to participate. At the meeting, in order to clarify thinking, the workshop director first gave a report based on the national plan, detailing that in order to complete this year's national plan, the key lies in improving equipment utilization. Then, a discussion was held based on the workshop director's report. During the discussion, it was revealed that the cadres lacked confidence, believing that the plan was set too high and that this year's national task could not be completed without increasing equipment. Thus, further specific analysis was made, explaining the favorable conditions for completing the national plan and the existing difficulties. In this way, on the one hand, everyone's confidence was increased, and on the other hand, blind optimism was criticized, and everyone's thinking was focused on one point: how to specifically solve the difficult problems. Once the key was clarified, the technical effort directions were clearly put forward through the technical staff’s explanations. After that, the instructions from the higher levels and the experience of the second workshop of Factory 53 in mobilizing employees to discuss the national plan were studied. Thus, on the basis of unified thinking, a specific action plan for the workshop was formulated. Because the comrades who participated in the enlarged meeting of the branch played a leading role, the work was carried out smoothly.

On the basis of ideological consistency, each system clearly divides its responsibilities, cooperates with each other, and fully exerts the role of organization.

After studying, on the basis of everyone's ideological consistency, after formulating a specific action plan, the next step is to conduct a clear division of labor, determine the responsibilities of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League, cooperate with each other, and establish necessary work systems to further exert the role of various organizations. Generally speaking, our principle of division of labor is this:

First, the Party is responsible for strengthening political and ideological leadership. Whenever a work task or central movement comes down, the Party committee first organizes leading cadres to study, unify thinking, and unify understanding. This spirit must be implemented in the workshop branches. At the same time, establish a "brainstorming session" system to promptly solve specific problems in daily work. The Party committee also regularly understands the situation of the movement and grasps the ideological trends of cadres and workers through the Party organization, the trade union, and the Youth League organization, conducts timely analysis and research, and leads the ideological struggle inside and outside the Party. For example, in the discussion of the national plan, we learned that in the lead electrolysis workshop, some workers had a competitive mentality when trying to find tricks, burying themselves in research, unwilling to discuss with others, fearing that others would take their tricks away. This mentality hindered the development of the mass trick movement. This situation was studied at the branch meeting, and a call was immediately made after the meeting to promote the spirit of collectivism, proposing the slogan of "learning tricks, discussing tricks, and finding tricks in tricks" and announcing the methods for handling tricks. The branch also used real people and real events to educate the masses. The worker Zhou Jingwen was unwilling to cooperate with others when looking for tricks. The branch secretary patiently enlightened and persuaded him, helping him realize his erroneous thinking of working alone and not cooperating with others, and he made a self-criticism to the masses. In this way, the trick-finding movement was quickly and widely launched, and more than 100 tricks appeared in four days. The major key problem of the anode plate was solved, and the output of the anode plate was increased from 700 pieces to 1,000 pieces.

The Party often relies on Party members through the Party organization, and at the same time leads the organizations of the trade union and the Youth League to carry out political work. For example, the lead electrolysis workshop branch, in order to respond to the call of the Party committee that "good Party members must be good members," repeatedly criticized the erroneous thinking of some Party members that "they are led by the branch, but not by the trade union," and educated Party members to actively participate in trade union work. Therefore, many Party members have gained the trust of the masses, so that the branch can more effectively promote trade union work through these Party members.

The Youth League is a capable assistant of the Party. In every work, under the leadership of the Party, the Youth League is responsible for educating League members, playing a leading role, carrying out propaganda work to the masses, and uniting veteran workers and technicians to respond to the call of the Party. At the same time, it promptly reflects the ideological situation of the masses to the Party, helps the Party to understand and grasp the situation of the movement, and cooperates with the trade union to carry out various propaganda and mobilization work.

Second, the administrative aspect is mainly responsible for proposing plans, proposing indicators, pointing out the key problems of each workshop, as well as specific plans for technical measures, safety measures, and welfare measures in order to realize the above indicators. Still taking the lead electrolysis workshop's discussion of the national plan as an example: After the director of the lead electrolysis workshop reported on the national plan, he explained the specific measures to complete the national plan and pointed out to the workers the four key points for completing this year's plan: (1) The output of anode plates must be increased from 700 pieces per day to 1,000 pieces, and the output of cathode plates must be increased from 1,200 pieces per day to 2,000 pieces. (2) In order to adapt to the increase in output, the utilization rate of cranes must be increased. (3) The electrolysis team must solve the problem of concentrated washing liquid. (4) The filter must improve efficiency. After the workshop director's report, the trade union organized a discussion. In order to break through the above key points, the workshop director mobilized technicians and staff in the Party branch, and at the same time organized technical staff to be responsible for solving a certain problem. That is to say, the workshop director should be responsible for organizing administrative staff to propose specific measures and plans, and the Party and the trade union will guarantee its implementation. For welfare measures and safety measures, the administration should also formulate implementation plans, hand them over to the masses for discussion through the trade union, and then gather the opinions of the masses and designate a special person to be responsible for promoting their realization; the trade union should assist; and the Party organization should supervise the administration and the trade union to thoroughly realize them.

After learning the experience of Factory 53, most of the administrative cadres in our factory have realized that it is impossible to rely solely on administrative orders. As long as we can rely on the organizations of the Party and the trade union, no matter how great the difficulties, they can be solved.

Third, the task of the trade union is mainly to mobilize workers to do a good job in production, conduct education, and do a good job in welfare. In the discussion of the national plan, the trade union must first, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, cooperate with the administration to mobilize workers to discuss the national plan. In order to mobilize workers, it is necessary to carry out propaganda and education among the workers, use the achievements of our factory in increasing production and practicing economy in the past two years to compare with the improvement of wages and welfare, explain the consistency between the state's planned economic construction and individual interests, widely carry out communist education, and deeply carry out the mobilization work to strive to complete the three major tasks. Lead the workers to discuss: Why should we discuss the national plan; what is the key to completing this year's national plan; what is the significance of this year's three major tasks; and where does welfare come from, etc. Through discussion, the class consciousness of workers is raised, and then workers are mobilized to formulate group plans. After the group plans are formulated, the group's "mutual inspection" is carried out to check whether the group plan has conservative or adventurous tendencies, and to check whether it is formalism. Through "mutual inspection," mass criticism and self-criticism are launched.

At the same time, the trade union should cooperate with the administration to seriously handle the rationalization proposals and tricks put forward by the masses, and handle the opinions put forward by the masses.

After the group plans are formulated, the trade union should further organize patriotic labor competitions, promote advanced experience, and continue to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of workers to ensure the specific realization of group plans and national plans. In the competition, the trade union should organize inspections, conduct rewards, and summarize the advanced experience in the competition.

The above is the division of labor of Party, government, trade union, and Youth League organizations in our work. Because we have learned the experience of Factory 53, we have overcome the leadership method of "handling everything" and "grabbing everything," and exerted the role of various organizations.

Go deep into production, go deep into life, and strengthen political and ideological leadership.

Using the method of strengthening political and ideological leadership to combine political work with economic work to realize the Party's guarantee and supervisory role in enterprises. This is a major experience of Factory 53. We learn the experience of Factory 53 in combining political work with economic work and do it in this way. The experience of Factory 53 completely and comprehensively provides us with specific methods to realize "relying on the working class to run enterprises well." It also makes us more deeply understand the great significance of the Northeast Bureau's proposal that "relying on the working class is the basic idea of our Party in managing industry and running factories well. All work in enterprises must implement the idea of relying on the working class, and this idea must be clarified among cadres and repeatedly educated."

In the past, our understanding of relying on the working class to run factories well was not clear enough. Subjectively, we thought that being able to talk about democracy, discussing things with everyone, not committing bureaucracy, and not doing everything for them meant relying on the working class. This understanding is still abstract, and it may waver when encountering specific problems. For example, when we signed collective contracts in 1952, many cadres expressed doubts about putting welfare issues to the masses for discussion, believing that it was not appropriate to do so. The reason is: they are afraid that the demands of the masses will be too high, and if they cannot be resolved, the leaders will be in a passive position. At this time, we again learned the experience of Factory 53 in this regard, and realized that as long as we explain clearly to the masses how much enterprise bonus funds are available for welfare this year, which things must be done first, how much money will be spent, and which things cannot be done temporarily, the masses will discuss and figure out what is most urgently needed by everyone and must be done first. As long as the "bottom line" is explained clearly, the masses will not make excessive demands. Whether or not it can be handed over to the masses for discussion is not a question of whether the masses demand too much, but a question of our trust in the masses. If it is not explained clearly, the masses will ask to do this and that, and the leading cadres will have to come to make explanations to patch things up, explaining why this is not possible and why that is not possible. As a result, the masses will say: "Why bother discussing? You can decide." This will put the leaders in a passive position.

We have also learned from the experience of Factory 53 and realized that relying on the working class should be specifically reflected in three aspects: (1) Relying on the working class must start with educating the workers and masses, and it is necessary to continuously improve the political consciousness and cultural and technical level of the workers. Otherwise, there is no real reliance on the strength and wisdom of the working class, and the high enthusiasm and creativity of the working class cannot be fully utilized; (2) Relying on the working class, in the enterprise, means relying on all employees, including staff, technicians, especially relying on the advanced elements and activists among the working class to form a core force. It is even more important to vigorously give play to the role of the trade union and the Youth League, and to continuously strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses through the work of the trade union; (3) Relying on the working class, it is necessary to deeply understand the needs of the workers, care for and gradually improve the labor protection, daily material and cultural life, and welfare of the workers. These three points give us a direction for our work and allow us to understand how to use the method of strengthening political and ideological leadership to get rid of the formalism of simply doing Party affairs work, combine political work with economic work, and guarantee and supervise the completion of production tasks. For example, in the Quality Inspection Movement, after touching our thinking, we found that workers generally had thoughts such as "the quality is almost good enough" and "it is impossible to improve it further." We used the method of detailed accounting to carry out propaganda and education, calculating the value of metal loss of a product from January to mid-June 1951, which could buy two jet aircraft. Using these concrete materials to repeatedly educate the workers, we broke the workers' complacency and conservative thinking.

In the process of our work, we more deeply realized that to strengthen political and ideological leadership, we must go deep into production, go deep into life, and thoroughly understand the production situation and ideological situation of all employees. Otherwise, there is no way to strengthen ideological leadership. In September 1951, we found that the lead furnace front bed solidified, hindering the normal progress of production. When discussing this issue at the workshop's production technology meeting, most people believed that the task of increasing production and practicing economy had been completed ahead of schedule, and it didn't matter if the furnace was stopped for a few days for repairs. We followed this clue, deeply understood the ideological situation of the workers, and found that after the task of increasing production and practicing economy was completed in most workshops at the end of September, the workers generally had a sense of complacency and relaxation. So we launched the movement to find faults. We proposed: "Finding faults is increasing production and practicing economy!" Through this movement, the workers found many faults in their work, overcame the slack thinking, and improved their work. The problem of solidification of the lead furnace front bed was also solved. Not only was the furnace not stopped for repairs, but additional tasks were added. The whole factory added more than 30,000 tons of grain to the task of increasing production and practicing economy under such circumstances.

Going deep into life means caring about the lives of the masses and paying attention to improving the working conditions and welfare of employees in order to mobilize the masses and do a good job. For example, the smoke pollution problem in the smelting department was very serious, affecting workers' health and production morale. Workers said: "I don't know how long I can work. I'm choked enough. I'll be in a sanatorium soon!" So we urged the administration to improve the equipment and solve the smoke pollution problem by dividing the smoke ducts. Electric fans were installed in the lead electrolysis workshop to solve the problem of acid mist. Some workers said: "The factory director didn't even install electric fans for himself, but installed electric fans for us first! If we don't work hard, who will we be worthy of!" In addition, the number of people who left production for treatment of chronic diseases was expanded, the difficulties in life during the treatment period for those in sanatoriums were resolved, clubs were built, the health cafeteria was improved, and cultural studies were held. This greatly improved the material and cultural life of the workers. When carrying out these tasks, we conducted political education for the workers, explaining that only on the basis of developing production can we continuously improve our lives.

In order to strengthen ideological leadership, the Party must be good at using various organizations (Party, Youth League, trade union, administration) to combine typical investigations with general investigations to grasp the ideological situation of employees. This work of investigation and research cannot be interrupted at all. For example, in the discussion of the national plan, we found that employees generally had the ideological obstacle of "the task cannot be completed without increasing equipment." We conducted education to target this idea, put forward the favorable conditions for increasing production and practicing economy this year, the key problems in production, mobilized workers to find tricks, break through the key points, and used typical examples to carry out education to eliminate this ideological obstacle. Some workers believed that ordinary workers could not find tricks, so we specifically helped the ordinary worker Li Chunfu find tricks. After Li Chunfu found a big trick, we used Li Chunfu's typical example to carry out education. Some workers said:

"All the tricks were found last year, and there is not much profit this year!" We organized discussions and used the propaganda method of "trick meeting" to announce the number of tricks that had been found and their value to educate the workers. Experience has proven that Factory 53's method of strengthening political and ideological leadership to combine political work with economic work is an effective method for realizing the Party's guarantee and supervisory role in enterprises.

Problems existing in learning

Although we have insisted on learning the experience of Factory 53 for two years, we still have many shortcomings in the learning process, and we need to continue to learn the experience of Factory 53 to make up for these shortcomings.

First, the experience of Factory 53 has not been mastered by all cadres in the factory, especially middle-level cadres. We plan to organize deputy-level cadres from the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League for systematic study under the unified leadership of the Party committee in June this year; and we will regularly organize seminars to exchange experiences and insights in order to further study the experience of Factory 53 widely and deeply.

Second, Factory 53 is more stable, deep, and thorough than we are in carrying out work. Especially in "touching our thoughts" and educating employees, Factory 53 does a better job than us. When we do a job, it is easier to mobilize employees, but we often feel that the movement starts too vigorously, and it is not easy to grasp the "heat"; when the movement is about to end, the leaders are busy deploying the next work, so they relax their grip on the situation of the employees, resulting in disconnection.

Third, there are still problems with the allocation of spare time, mainly because it is not well implemented, and it becomes chaotic when there is too much work. It was originally stipulated that only two hours of spare time are allowed to be occupied every day, but political study, cultural study, and technical study take up one and a half hours every day. If a central movement comes, organizing everyone to discuss and hold meetings will inevitably exceed the time limit. The problem of cadres holding too many concurrent positions has not been resolved.

    我们怎样学习和运用五三工厂的经验
    出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会代表
    中共沈阳冶炼厂党委书记  魏文风
    从实际出发，结合当前中心工作，是学习和运用五三工厂经验的关键
    我们学习五三工厂的经验，首先是抓紧了在党的领导下，进行有组织的学习，以便统一思想和工作步调。
    从一九五一年七月开始，我们就组织了干部学习，这个学习一直坚持到现在。两年来的经验证明，组织干部学习，统一思想，这是开展工作的必要步骤。比如在一九五一年刚展开增产节约运动时，干部中意见有分歧：有些车间干部在思想上存在着一些顾虑，他们恐怕搞增产节约运动会冲淡了质量大检查运动。因此就提出“先结束质量大检查，再集中力量搞增产节约运动”的建议。而党委和工厂领导方面则认为可以结合起来搞。党委和厂长指出：搞质量大检查，在冶炼工业中来说，关键在于提高实收率、降低回炉品的品位，提高产品质量。而这样作也正是我们在增产节约中所要全力解决的问题。因此搞好质量，就是增产节约，这两件事是不可分割的。经过反复讨论，干部思想逐渐明确。为了进一步统一思想，我们又学习了前东北人民政府高岗主席在城市工作会议上的总结报告及前东北人民政府工业部王鹤寿部长“为提高质量而奋斗”的报告。这就打消了某些干部“怕结合不起来”的思想顾虑。在思想统一的基础上，决定了开展增产节约运动的具体步骤。在推广先进经验的工作中也是这样。开始时有些干部对先进经验认识不足，认为什么先进经验不先进经验，这全是碰大运。有的车间干部认为推广先进经验是工厂领导上的事，车间管不着。因此我们又认真地领导大家学习文件，展开讨论和批判，使大家明确认识到大力推广先进生产经验，完成增产节约计划的主要方法。我们并以焙烧车间焦长祥的先进操作经验为例，说明推广先进经验的重要性。当时焦长祥的块率达到百分之八十到八十二，而别人只达到百分之七十二上下。如果把这一经验推广到全车间，使每炉普遍达到百分之八十二的块率，完成增产节约任务就有了把握。焦长祥的实例，教育了干部，清除了推广先进经验的障碍。
    在今年讨论国家计划时，我们不但组织了车间一级干部（包括科长、党群脱产干部）的学习，而且更把这一方法推广到车间，使车间工段长一级干部
    （包括工会、党团小组长以上干部及积极分子，先进工作者）也能通过学习，统一思想，明确关键。这种学习形式和厂一级干部的学习有些不同。车间是根据一个中心任务下来后，用党支部扩大会议的形式召开的，而不是经常性的。今年铅电解车间讨论国家计划时的具体作法，就是：首先在车间召开党支部扩大会议，并吸收了行政班长、工会和团的小组长以上干部及积极分子、先进工作者参加。在会上为了明确思想，首先由车间主任根据国家计划作报告，详细指出为了完成今年国家计划，关键就在提高设备运用率。接着就根据车间主任的报告，进行了讨论。在讨论中，暴露了干部信心不大，认为计划提得过高，不增加设备，就不能完成今年的国家任务。于是进一步作了具体的分析，说明了完成国家计划的有利条件和存在的困难问题。这样，一方面提高了大家的信心，另一方面也批判了盲目的乐观情绪，而把大家的思想集中到一点上：如何具体解决困难问题。关键明确了，再经过技术员的讲解，明确地提出了技术上的努力方向。接着又学习了上级的指示及五三工厂二车间发动职工讨论国家计划的经验，于是，在思想统一的基础上制订了车间的具体行动计划。由于参加支部扩大会议的同志起了带头作用，使工作顺利地展开了。
    在思想一致的基础上，各系统明确分工，互相配合，充分发挥组织作用
    通过学习，在大家思想一致的基础上，制订了具体行动计划以后，紧接着就要进行明确的分工，确定党、行政、工会、青年团的职责，互相配合，并建立必要的工作制度，进一步发挥了各种组织的作用。一般地说，我们分工的原则是这样：
    第一、党负责加强政治思想领导。每逢一个工作任务或中心运动下来时，党委首先组织领导干部进行学习，统一思想，统一认识。这种精神一直要贯彻到车间支部。同时，建立“碰头会”的制度，及时解决日常工作中的具体问题。党委并经常通过党的组织、工会及团的组织，了解运动情况，掌握干部和工人的思想动态，及时进行分析研究，领导党内外的思想斗争。比如在讨论国家计划中，我们了解到铅电解车间在找窍门中，有部分工人产生了争功思想，自己埋头研究，不愿和别人讨论，害怕别人把自己的窍门占了去，这种思想，阻碍了群众性窍门运动的展开。在支部会上对这种情况进行了研究，会后马上号召发扬集体精神，提出“学习窍门，讨论窍门，窍门里找窍门”的口号，并公布处理窍门的办法。支部又用真人真事向群众进行教育。工人周景文，在找窍门时，不肯和别人合作，支部书记就对他进行了耐心的启发和说服，帮助他认识到自己单干，不和别人合作的错误思想，由他向群众进行自我批评。这样，很快就使找窍门运动广泛展开起来，四天中，出现了一百多个窍门。解决了阳极板的重大关键问题，使阳极板的产量从七百片提高到一千片。
    党经常通过党的组织，依靠党员，同时领导工会和青年团的组织，进行政治工作。如铅电解车间支部，为了响应党委提出的“好党员要是好会员”的号召，反复批评了有些党员中存在的“受支部领导，不受工会领导”的错误思想，教育了党员积极参加工会工作。因此，好多党员都取得了群众的信任，这样，支部通过这些党员，就能更有力地去推动工会工作。
    青年团是党的得力助手，每个工作中，青年团在党的领导下，负责教育团员，起带头作用，向群众进行宣传工作，团结老工人和技术人员响应党的号召。同时，并及时向党反映群众的思想情况，帮助党了解和掌握运动情况，配合工会进行各种宣传鼓动工作。
    第二，行政方面主要是负责提出计划，提出指标，指出各车间的关键问题，以及为了实现上面各项指标的技术措施、保安措施、福利措施的具体计划。仍以铅电解车间讨论国家计划为例：铅电解车间主任报告国家计划后，即说明了完成国家计划的具体措施，并向职工指出完成今年计划的四大关键：（一）阳极板必须从日产七百片提高到一千片，阴极板必须从日产一千二百片提高到二千片。（二）为了适应产量的提高，必须提高吊车运用率。（三）电解组要解决浓缩洗液问题。（四）过滤机要提高效率。车间主任报告后，工会即组织了讨论。车间主任为了突破以上关键，在党支部发动技术人员、职员的同时，组织了技职人员分工负责解决某一问题。就是说，车间主任要把行政工作人员负责组织起来，提出具体措施计划，党和工会保证其执行。对于福利措施和保安措施，行政上也要订出实施的计划，通过工会，交给群众讨论，然后将群众意见集中起来，指定专人负责促其实现；工会要予以协助；党组织要监督行政和工会彻底实现。
    学习五三工厂经验以后，我们厂子的大部分行政干部都认识到了：单靠行政命令是行不通的，只要能依靠党和工会的组织，不管多大的困难都能解决。
    第三，工会的任务，主要是发动职工搞好生产、进行教育和搞好福利。工会在讨论国家计划中，首先要在党委的统一领导下，和行政协同一致，发动职工讨论国家计划。为了发动职工，就必须在职工中进行宣传教育，用两年来我厂增产节约的成绩，对照工资、福利的提高情况，说明国家有计划的经济建设与个人利益的一致性，广泛地进行共产主义教育，深入进行为完成三大任务而奋斗的动员工作。领导职工讨论：为什么要讨论国家计划；完成今年国家计划的关键是什么；今年三大任务有什么重大意义；以及福利由哪儿来等问题。通过讨论，提高职工的阶级觉悟，然后发动职工制订小组计划。小组计划订好后，再进行小组的“互查”，检查小组计划有无保守和冒险的偏向，检查是否形式主义，通过“互查”，展开群众性的批评与自我批评。
    同时，工会应协同行政上认真处理群众提出的合理化建议和窍门，处理群众提出的意见。
    小组计划订好之后，工会就要进一步组织爱国主义的劳动竞赛，推广先进经验，继续提高职工的政治、文化、技术水平，保证小组计划、国家计划的具体实现。在竞赛中，工会应组织检查，进行奖励，并总结竞赛中的先进经验。
    以上就是我们在进行工作时，党、政、工、团组织分工情况。由于我们学习了五三工厂的经验，已经克服了“一揽子”、“头发胡子一把抓”的领导方法，发挥了各种组织的作用。
    深入生产，深入生活，加强政治思想领导
    用加强政治思想领导的方法，把政治工作与经济工作结合起来，以实现党在企业中的保证和监督作用。这是五三工厂的一条主要经验。我们学习五三工厂政治工作与经济工作相结合的经验，就是这样做起来的。五三工厂的经验完整而全面地向我们提供了实现“依靠工人阶级搞好企业”的具体方法。也使我们更深刻地体会到东北局提出的“依靠工人阶级是我党管理工业、办好工厂的基本思想，在企业中一切工作都必须贯彻依靠工人阶级思想，必须在干部中明确这一思想，反复进行教育”的重大意义。
    过去我们对依靠工人阶级办好工厂的认识是不够明确的。主观上以为：能够讲民主，有事找大家商量，不犯官僚主义，不包办代替，就是依靠工人阶级了。这样的认识还是抽象的，碰到具体问题就可能动摇不定。如我们在一九五二年签订集体合同时，好多干部都对把福利问题提出交群众讨论表示怀疑，认为这样作不适宜。理由是：怕群众提的要求过高，解决不了，领导会陷于被动。这时我们又学习了五三工厂在这方面的经验，认识到只要我们向群众详细交代清楚，今年有多少企业奖励基金可用在福利事业上，必须先办那些事，得花多少钱，那些事暂时还办不到。交代清楚后，群众讨论起来就会弄清楚什么是大家最迫切需要的，必须先办的。只要把“底”交清了，群众也就不会提出过高的要求。能否交给群众讨论，问题不在于群众要求过高，而在于我们对群众的信任如何。如果交代不清，群众才会提出这个要办，那个要办，领导干部就不得不来作补窟窿的解释，这个如何不行，那个如何不行。结果，群众便会说：“还讨论干啥，你们说了算就得了呗。”这样就会使领导陷于被动。
    我们又学习了五三工厂的经验，领会到依靠工人阶级应当具体表现在三个方面：（一）依靠工人阶级必须从教育工人群众着手，要不断提高工人的政治觉悟和文化技术水平，否则就谈不到真正的依靠工人阶级的力量和智慧，充分发挥工人阶级的高度积极性和创造性；（二）依靠工人阶级，在企业中来说，就是必须依靠全体职工，包括职员、技术员，尤其是依靠工人阶级中的先进分子和积极分子，使他们形成核心力量。大力发挥工会、青年团的作用，而不断通过工会的工作密切党与群众的联系，更为重要；（三）依靠工人阶级，必须深入了解工人的需要，关心和逐步地改善工人中的劳动保护、日常的物质文化生活和福利事业。这三点使得我们有了工作的方向，懂得了用加强政治思想领导的方法，摆脱单纯做党务工作的事务主义的作法，把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，保证和监督完成生产任务。比如在质量大检查运动中，我们经过摸思想发现工人中较普遍地存在了“质量差不多了”“无法再提高了”等思想。我们就运用算细账的办法，进行宣传教育，计算出一九五一年一月到六月中，一个产品金属的损失价值，就能买两架喷气式飞机用这些具体材料向职工进行反复的教育，打破了职工自满和保守的思想。
    在我们的工作过程中，更深刻地体会到加强政治思想领导，必须深入到生产、深入到生活中去，彻底了解全体职工的生产情况及思想情况，否则，就谈不到加强思想领导。在一九五一年九月，我们发觉铅炉前床凝固，阻碍了生产的正常进行。在车间的生产技术会议上讨论这个问题时，大多数人认为增产节约任务已经提前完成，停几天炉修理也没关系。我们跟着这一线索，深入了解职工的思想情况，发现了九月末大部车间的增产节约任务完成后，职工中普遍地存在了自满和松劲的情绪。于是我们就发起了找毛病运动。我们提出：“找出毛病就是增产节约！”经过这一运动，职工们找出了在工作中的不少毛病，克服了松劲思想，使工作提高了一步。铅炉前床凝固的问题也得到了解决。不但没停炉修理，反而追加了任务。全厂就在这样的情况下，追加了增产节约三万多吨粮食的任务。
    深入生活，就是要关心群众生活，注意改善职工的劳动条件和福利事业，以便发动群众，搞好工作。例如熔炼部的烟害问题很严重，影响工人健康和生产情绪。工人们说：“还不知道能干多久呢，呛的够受，快住疗养院了吧！”于是我们就督促行政，改善了设备，用分烟道的办法解决了烟害问题。在铅电解车间安上电扇，解决了酸雾的问题。有的工人说：“厂长都不安电扇，倒替咱先安上电扇啦！再不好好干，对得起谁！”另外又扩大了慢性病的脱离生产疗养的名额，解决疗养员疗养期间在生活上的困难问题，修建了俱乐部，改善了保健食堂，举办了文化学习等。这就大大地改善了职工的物质、文化生活。在进行这些工作时，我们都向职工进行了政治教育，说明只有在发展生产的基础上，才能不断提高生活。
    为了加强思想领导党要善于通过各种组织（党、青年团、工会、行政），用典型调查和一般调查相结合的方法，掌握职工的思想情况。这种调查研究的工作，是一点不能中断的。例如在讨论国家计划中，我们发觉职工普遍存在了“不增加设备，就不能完成任务”的思想障碍，我们针对这种思想进行了教育，提出今年增产节约的有利条件，生产中的关键问题，发动工人找窍门，突破关键，并用典型事例来进行教育，扫除这种思想障碍。又有的工人认为普通工不能找窍门，我们就具体帮助普通工李春甫找窍门，李春甫找到一个大窍门以后，我们就用李春甫的典型例子，进行教育。有的工人说：
    “去年窍门找绝了，今年没有多大油水了！”我们就组织讨论，并利用“窍门会师”的宣传方法，公布已找出的窍门数目及其价值，向职工进行教育。经验证明：五三工厂用加强政治思想领导的方法，使政治工作与经济工作结合起来，是实现党在企业中的保证和监督作用的有效方法。
    在学习中存在的问题
    虽然我们两年来都坚持了学习五三工厂的经验，但是，我们在学习过程中，还存在了很多缺点，需要我们继续努力学习五三工厂的经验来弥补这些缺点。
    第一，五三工厂的经验，还没有为全厂干部所掌握，尤其是中层干部。我们准备在今年六月间，由党委统一领导，组织党、政、工、团副职干部进行有系统的学习；并经常组织座谈，交流经验和心得，以便广泛深入地进一步学习五三工厂经验。
    第二，五三工厂进行工作时比我们作得稳、深和透。尤其是在“摸思想”，向职工进行教育这一点上，五三工厂比我们作得好。我们在搞一件工作时，发动职工比较容易，但是我们常常感到：运动开始劲头太猛，不容易掌握“火候”；运动快结束时，领导又忙于部署下一工作，就放松了掌握职工情况，产生脱节现象。
    第三，分配业余时间还有问题，主要就是执行不好，工作一多就乱了。本来规定每天只准占用业余时间两小时，可是每天的政治学习、文化学习、技术学习，每天总得占用一小时半，如果中心运动一来，组织大家讨论和开会，就非超过不可。尤其是中心任务来后，大家都集中力量搞中心工作，很容易又打乱党、行政、工会、青年团的活动时间。对于干部兼职过多的问题，也还没有获得解决。
