After ten days of plenary sessions and group discussions, the congress adopted the Report on the Work of Chinese Trade Unions, the Report on Amending the Constitution of Chinese Trade Unions and the Constitution of Chinese Trade Unions, and the Report on National Trade Union Financial Work. The congress summarized the achievements and experiences of the Chinese workers' movement in the four years since the Sixth National Labor Congress in 1948 and formulated the guiding principles and tasks for trade union work during the period of national planned construction. The congress elected the new leading body of the national trade union – the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions – demonstrating the unprecedented unity of the Chinese working class.

A total of 831 delegates attended this congress, with 813 registered attendees. They represented 10.2 million trade union members in 29 provinces, 12 major cities, and one autonomous region.

During the congress, 38 trade union representatives and model workers from various regions and industries spoke. They reported on the great achievements of workers in different regions and industries in the national economic recovery and construction work, demonstrating the determination of the Chinese working class to fulfill and overfulfill national construction plans and defend the cause of peace.

This congress fully demonstrated the internationalist unity between the Chinese working class and the working classes of all countries, and it received congratulations from the working classes of the world. Foreign guests invited to participate in the congress included: the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the representative of the Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the WFTU, trade union representatives from twenty countries in Asia, Europe, Australia, and Africa, as well as the Burmese government labor inspection group and peace activists from various countries currently in Beijing, totaling 105 people. Louis Saillant, head of the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Vasily Prohorov, head of the Soviet trade union delegation, and trade union representatives from nineteen countries, totaling 25 people, addressed the congress. The congress also received numerous congratulatory telegrams and letters from trade union organizations and industrial enterprises in countries such as North Korea, Vietnam, Albania, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and the United States. These speeches, congratulatory telegrams, and letters expressed the celebration and support of the world's working class for the great peaceful construction undertaken by the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, and they expressed the love of the world's working class for the cause of peace and their firm belief in fighting for peace. This further encouraged the enthusiasm and confidence of Chinese workers in building their motherland and defending world peace. Through this congress, the Chinese working class has further clarified their international responsibilities. The delegates participating in the congress unanimously expressed that the Chinese working class must make greater efforts for the unity and solidarity of the international workers' movement and for lasting international peace.

On the afternoon of the 11th, all members of the presidium of the congress ascended the rostrum. The executive chairmen of the congress were Liu Ningyi, Lai Ruoyu, Liu Changsheng, Wu Yuzhang, and Zhu Xuefan.

Before the closing of the congress, the congress invited Feng Zhenye, deputy political commissar of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers who participated in the Battle of Shangganling, and Yin Weichen, an agricultural labor model from Beijing, to speak. Both of them paid tribute to the congress and congratulated it on its victory.

Feng Zhenye said that the great working class of the motherland played a significant role in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and has made brilliant contributions to the cause of national economic construction. These roles and contributions have directly given tremendous encouragement and strong support to the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea. For more than two years, the Chinese and North Korean People's forces have fought side by side on the Korean front and achieved great victories. He detailed the process of the famous Battle of Shangganling and the heroic deeds of heroes such as Huang Jiguang, Sun Zhanyuan, Yi Caixue, and Chen Zhiguo who participated in the Battle of Shangganling, their high spirit of self-sacrifice and their witty and tenacious fighting style, and their unparalleled loyalty to defending the motherland and defending peace. Feng Zhenye said that the victory of the Battle of Shangganling fully proves that the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are becoming stronger and stronger in battle, and are increasingly confident in crushing any frantic attack by the enemy. The Chinese People's Volunteers, who have won the victory in the Battle of Shangganling, have full determination and confidence to join forces with the Korean People's Army to defeat the invaders and defend the motherland's large-scale construction.

Yin Weichen said that since liberation, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. The agricultural production cooperative he leads increased its output in 1952 by more than 40% compared to the mutual aid group in 1951. Worker comrades have manufactured many new agricultural tools and pesticides for the farmers, enabling them to improve their farming techniques and overcome pests and diseases. The farmers deeply thank the worker comrades for their leadership and support, and we have fully realized that workers and peasants are inseparable brothers. With the development of production, the living standards of the peasants have also been greatly improved, and in the future, machines will be used for collective production, living a more beautiful collective life than now. The peasants know that only when the country realizes industrialization and produces a large amount of steel, coal, petroleum, and various machines can agriculture gradually realize collectivization; only when the country is industrialized will the national defense forces be stronger, and peaceful and happy life will have full guarantee. He said that the farmers will definitely produce more grain and industrial raw materials to support the construction cause of the great motherland. The farmers deeply feel that under the leadership of the working class, the close cooperation between the working class and the peasants will surely make the construction cause of the motherland a victorious success.

The speeches of Feng Zhenye, the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Yin Weichen, the representative of the peasants, especially Feng Zhenye's speech, were warmly welcomed by the whole audience. When they finished speaking, the congress delegates presented flowers to the two of them respectively, paying tribute to the heroes who defended the motherland and defended peace; paying tribute to the peasant brothers, the eternal allies of the working class. Fang Taiyu, head of the Korean trade union delegation, went to the rostrum and warmly shook hands with Feng Zhenye to express the sincere gratitude of the Korean working class to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers who resisted America and aided Korea.

The congress passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, a telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a telegram of respect to the World Federation of Trade Unions.

After passing the telegram of respect to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the congress also unanimously approved the list of the Chinese trade union delegation to the Third World Trade Union Congress to be held in October this year, consisting of 30 people including Liu Ningyi and Liu Changsheng.

    在十一日下午大会上，大会主席团全体登上了主席台。大会执行主席是刘宁一、赖若愚、刘长胜、吴玉章和朱学范。
    在大会闭幕前，大会邀请中国人民志愿军代表、参加上甘岭战役的某部副政治委员冯振业和北京市农业劳动模范殷维臣讲话。他们两人都向大会致敬，并祝贺大会的胜利。
    冯振业说，伟大的祖国工人阶级在抗美援朝运动中起了重大的作用，在祖国经济建设事业中又有着辉煌的贡献。这些作用和贡献，都直接给了在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军以莫大的鼓舞和有力的支援。两年多以来，中朝人民部队在朝鲜前线并肩作战，取得了伟大的胜利。他详细地介绍了有名的上甘岭战斗的经过和参加上甘岭战斗的黄继光、孙占元、易才学、陈治国等英雄人物的英勇事迹，他们的高度的自我牺牲精神和机智顽强的战斗作风，他们保卫祖国和保卫和平的无比忠诚。冯振业说，上甘岭战斗的胜利充分证明，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军越战越强，越来越有把握粉碎敌人的任何猖狂进攻。取得了上甘岭战斗胜利的中国人民志愿军，有充分的决心和信心和朝鲜人民军在一起击退侵略者，保卫祖国进行大规模建设。
    殷维臣说，解放以来，农民的生产积极性大大提高了。他自己所领导的农业生产合作社，一九五二年的产量，就比一九五一年互助组时的产量增加了四成多。工人同志给农民们制造了不少新式农具和农药，使农民们能改进耕种技术，战胜病虫灾害。农民们深深感谢工人同志们的领导和支援，我们已充分认识到工人和农民是亲密不可分的兄弟。随着生产的发展，农民的生活水平也有了很大的改善，将来还要用机器进行集体生产，过着比现在更美好的集体生活。农民们知道只有国家实现了工业化，生产了大量钢铁、煤、石油和各种机器，农业才能逐步实现集体化；只有国家工业化了，国防力量才会更强大，和平、幸福的生活也才会有充分的保障。他说，农民一定生产更多的粮食和工业原料来支持伟大祖国的建设事业。农民们深深感到在工人阶级领导之下，工人阶级和农民的亲密合作，一定会使祖国的建设事业胜利成功。
