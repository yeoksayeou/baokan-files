Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, North Vietnam, May 25th: To celebrate President Ho Chi Minh's sixty-third birthday, the local forces and guerrillas of the Vietnamese People's Army launched successive attacks against the French army south of Hanoi in early May, achieving continuous victories.

The People's Army local forces and guerrillas cooperated closely in combat, eliminating five enemy strongholds in the Dong Quan area of Ha Dong Province and Nam Dinh Province, annihilating nearly 200 enemy soldiers, including 140 captured. At the same time, they captured one mortar, eight machine guns, and a large amount of other weapons and ammunition.

The People's Army local forces also raided the enemy strongholds of Ung Hoa in Ha Dong Province and Binh An Nhan in Hung Yen Province, annihilating more than one enemy company in total. In the attack on Binh An Nhan, the People's Army destroyed 19 French military motorcycles and a gasoline depot, and captured three mortars, 160 automatic weapons and rifles, and a large amount of other supplies.

The Dong Quan area is a pilot area for the implementation of the French colonialists' vicious village consolidation policy in North Vietnam. The French colonialists attempted to turn this area into a concentration camp for imprisoning farmers. The People's Army's attack on the Dong Quan area dealt a heavy blow to the enemy's conspiracy.

Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on May 25th, the Vietnamese People's Guerrillas continued to attack French transportation lines and strongholds in the North Vietnamese plains, killing or wounding nearly 500 French troops in more than 20 days starting from mid-April.

In seven days of operations in Vinh Phuc Province, northwest of Hanoi, the Vietnamese People's Guerrillas annihilated a total of 157 enemy soldiers. Among them, in the removal of a stronghold in Dong Anh County, 70 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and 70 rifles were captured.

In Bac Ninh Province, north of Hanoi, the guerrillas repelled an enemy "mopping-up" operation against Thuan Thanh County, killing or wounding 76 enemy soldiers. Guerrillas in Bac Giang Province also repelled enemy "mopping-up" operations against Dinh Tri village and Thai Son village, causing the enemy to lose more than 80 people and many weapons.

Guerrillas are also very active in Ha Dong, Ninh Binh, and Thai Binh provinces south of Hanoi. On April 29 alone, guerrillas in Ha Dong Province ambushed enemy transport teams twice, killing or wounding more than 50 enemy soldiers, including two second lieutenants; destroying two trucks, and capturing four machine guns and other equipment.

    庆祝胡志明主席寿辰
    越南人民军出击获胜
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十四日讯：越南人民军地方部队和游击队为了庆祝胡志明主席六十三岁寿辰，在五月初曾向河内以南的法军接连发动进攻，不断获得胜利。
    人民军地方部队和游击队紧密配合作战，曾拔除了在河东省同关地区和南定省的五个敌军据点，歼灭敌军近二百人，其中俘掳敌军一百四十人。同时并缴获迫击炮一门、机枪八挺及大量其他武器弹药。
    人民军地方部队并曾突袭河东省的应和及兴安省的贫安仁敌军据点，共歼敌一个多连。在突袭贫安仁的战斗中，人民军击毁法军的十九辆摩托车和一座汽油库，缴获迫击炮三门、自动武器和步枪一百六十支及其他大量物资。
    同关地区是法国殖民者在北越实行恶毒的并村政策的试点。法国殖民者企图把这个地区变为囚禁农民的集中营。人民军对同关地区的进攻，使敌人这个阴谋受到沉重的打击。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社二十五日讯：越南人民游击队在北越平原继续袭击法军的交通线和据点，从四月中旬起的二十多天中，杀伤法军近五百人。
    越南人民游击队在河内西北永福省的七天作战中，共歼灭敌军一百五十七人。其中在拔除东英县的一个据点中，杀伤敌军七十人，缴获七十支步枪。
    在河内以北的北宁省，游击队击退了敌军对顺清县的一次“扫荡”，杀伤敌军七十六人。北江省的游击队也曾打退敌军对定其村和泰山村的“扫荡”，使敌军损失了八十多人和许多武器。
    游击队在河内南面的河东、宁平和太平等省也很活跃。仅在四月二十九日，河东省的游击队就曾对敌军的运输队进行了两次伏击，打死打伤敌军五十多人，其中有两个少尉；击毁卡车两辆，缴获机枪四挺和其他装备。
