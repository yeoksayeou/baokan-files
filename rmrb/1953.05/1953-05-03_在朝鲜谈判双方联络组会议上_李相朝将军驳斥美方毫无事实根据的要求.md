    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 2nd: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice talks issued the following communique on May 2nd: The liaison groups of both sides held a meeting on May 2nd. At the meeting, the other side again groundlessly claimed that our side should still repatriate 375 sick and wounded prisoners of war from their side.
    The chief member of our side's liaison group, General Li Xiangchao, immediately stated:
    "Our side has already pointed out that our side has already repatriated to your side all sick and wounded prisoners of war that our side should repatriate, in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the agreement between the two sides. Our side originally put forward an estimated figure of 600 based on preliminary investigations. Subsequently, our side further included the sick and wounded prisoners of war finally received at the front in the scope of our repatriation. Currently, with the exception of those whose sick and wounded condition is not suitable for travel, our side has repatriated all 684 sick and wounded prisoners of war held by our side. The actual number repatriated is 14 percent higher than the initial estimate notified to your side, and the number of non-Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war has increased by 42 percent. In the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, our side has strictly abided by the agreement and completed our side's repatriation work. Disregarding these facts, your side has made baseless claims, saying that our side still retains sick and wounded prisoners of war who are able to travel but have not been repatriated. This is obviously not conducive to the work of repatriating sick and wounded prisoners of war by both sides. In order to jointly strive for a truce, we should be realistic and focus on the matter at hand, instead of insisting on one-sided, unfounded claims, attempting to use them to influence the entire armistice negotiations. We are willing to consider and discuss any demands that are consistent with the facts, but we cannot consider baseless demands and intimidating arguments."

    在朝鲜谈判双方联络组会议上
    李相朝将军驳斥美方毫无事实根据的要求
    【新华社开城二日电】　朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月二日发表公报如下：双方联络组五月二日举行会议。会上对方又毫无根据地声称我方仍应遣返对方三百七十五名病伤被俘人员。
    我方联络组首席组员李相朝将军当即表示：
    “我方早已指出，我方已经依照日内瓦公约和双方的协议，遣交给你方全部我方应予遣返的病伤被俘人员。我方原来根据了初步的调查，提出了六百名的估计数字。此后，我方更将最后在前方所收容的病伤战俘包括在我方遣返的范围之内。现除病伤情况不适于旅行者外，我方已全部遣返了六百八十四名我方收容下的病伤战俘。实际遣交数目较最初通知你方的估计数字增加百分之十四，其中非朝鲜籍病伤战俘增加百分之四十二。在双方交换病伤战俘中，我方已经严格遵守协议完成了我方的遣返工作。你方不顾这些事实，提出毫无根据的说法，说我方还留有能够旅行的病伤被俘人员未予遣返。这显然是无助于双方遣返病伤战俘的工作的。为了共同努力达成停战，我们正应该实事求是就事论事，而不应该坚持片面的无稽之谈，企图以它来影响整个停战谈判。凡是合于事实的要求，我们都愿加以考虑和讨论，但是我们不能考虑毫无事实根据的要求和威吓的论调”。
