Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 3rd: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued a communiqué on May 3rd as follows:

    On May 3rd, the opposing side repatriated to our side 105 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and 80 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Chinese People's Volunteers at Panmunjom. The opposing side claimed that it had completed the repatriation of all sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who should be immediately repatriated to our side.

    Since the beginning of the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war by both sides, the opposing side has repatriated a total of 6,670 sick and wounded prisoners of war to our side, including 5,640 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and 1,030 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 3rd: Today is the last day of this repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Among those returning to the motherland today are 80 captured personnel from the Volunteers and 105 captured personnel from the People's Army, including 21 female comrades. Many of the Volunteer personnel returning today still bear new scars, which were caused by another attack by the U.S. military on the eve of their repatriation. On April 30th, 75 captured Volunteer personnel who had been gathered at the U.S. 8th Prisoner of War Camp on Jeju Island awaiting repatriation, sent representatives to request that the U.S. side allow them to bid farewell to their comrades remaining in the prisoner of war camp. This representative was brutally beaten by the U.S. military. Starting at 2:50 p.m., the U.S. military fired gas bombs into their tents, a total of more than 200 times in three waves. Most of the people fainted, and many vomited blood, and the sputum turned green. At this time, the gas bombs also burned down the tents, and the sick and wounded people fainted on the ground, and many were burned. The U.S. military dragged out the wounded and sick who were in a coma, took off their tattered "prison clothes", put on U.S. military uniforms, and transported them from Jeju Island to Busan.

    The female comrades who had suffered greatly and were sent back burst into tears as soon as they entered the tent and hugged the female staff who received them. Some were sallow and thin, others had swollen faces, and their bodies were very weak. A young female comrade was lifted up from a stretcher, her hair disheveled, staring with a cold, fearful gaze. The reception staff comforted her and spoke to her, but she couldn't understand a word. She was obviously mentally deranged due to the enemy's abuse.

    The returning wounded and sick took off all the clothes, shoes and socks that the U.S. military had forced them to wear and threw them back into the U.S. vehicles. Some wore only a self-made People's Army cap and walked into our tent wearing only a pair of undershorts. A wounded Volunteer soldier lying on a stretcher kept saying: "They want to send us to Taiwan, that won't work!" The returning Korean female comrades also waved many self-made national flags and, while wiping away tears, sang "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" as they boarded the ambulances to return to Kaesong.
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 3rd: On May 2nd, another 500 sick and wounded prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army returned to the motherland through Panmunjom. They sang "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" in the U.S. ambulances, and when the doors opened, the singing and crying were mixed together. After getting out of the cars, the sick and wounded, with the greatest anger, threw the shirts and coats that the U.S. side had forced them to replace their original tattered clothes on the ground. One person threw moldy "rice" at the feet of a U.S. military officer. Many people were unwilling to enter the tent immediately. They glared at the U.S. military officer and shouted slogans with tears in their eyes: "Long live the motherland that rescued us from the island of death!" "Long live the Korean People's Army!" "Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!" Many people hugged our reception staff and burst into tears.

    On May 2nd, our sick and wounded prisoners of war also brought back many flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and two banners written in blood.

    It is very obvious that this angry emotion of our captured personnel is the result of the U.S. policy towards prisoners of war. Under the maintenance of our guards and reception personnel, the order in our reception area has been good. However, on May 2nd, the U.S. management officer lodged a "protest" with our side regarding the irrepressible anger of the sick and wounded personnel. When our management officer sternly pointed out the unreasonableness of this "protest", the U.S. management officer had to say: "I have nothing to say."

### 朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团发表公报  对方声称已将我方病伤被俘人员遣返完毕

    朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团发表公报
    对方声称已将我方病伤被俘人员遣返完毕 【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月三日发表公报如下：
    五月三日，对方在板门店遣返给我方朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员一百零五人，中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员八十人。对方声称，至此对方已将应即遣返给我方的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员遣返完毕。
    自双方遣返病伤被俘人员开始以来，对方遣返给我方病伤被俘人员总共六千六百七十人，其中朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员五千六百四十人，中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员一千零三十人。
    【新华社开城三日电】今天是这次病伤战俘遣返的最后一天，在今天重归祖国的有志愿军被俘人员八十人，人民军被俘人员一百零五人，其中包括女同志二十一人。今天回来的不少志愿军人员还带着新的伤痕，这是他们在遣返前夕又一次遭受美军攻击时造成的。四月三十日，济州岛美方第八战俘营集中起来等待遣返的志愿军被俘人员七十五人，推派代表要求美方准许他们向留在战俘营的同志们告别，这个代表竟遭受美军毒打。下午两点五十分起，美军就向他们住的帐篷投毒气弹，先后三次共达二百枚以上。大部分人都昏倒了，许多人吐血，吐出来的痰也变成绿色。此时，毒气弹还烧毁了帐篷，伤病员们昏倒在地上，许多人被烧伤。美军把在昏迷中的伤病员拖出，脱下他们褴褛的“囚衣”换上美军制服，把他们从济州岛运到釜山。
    被遣送回来的受尽苦难的女同志们一进帐篷就抱住接待她们的女工作人员嚎啕痛哭。她们有的面黄肌瘦，有的面部浮肿，身体都非常虚弱。一个年青的女同志，从担架上抬起身子，头发蓬乱，用一种严冷的、充满疑惧的眼光盯视着，接待人员安慰她，和她说话，但她一句也听不懂。她显然是由于敌人的虐待而已精神失常。
    归来的伤病员把一切美军强迫发给的衣服鞋袜都脱下丢回美方车里。有的只戴着自己做的一顶人民军制帽，穿着一条衬裤走进我方帐篷。一个躺在担架上的志愿军伤员不停地说：“他们要想把我们送到台湾去，那可不行！”归来的朝鲜女同志们也挥动着许多面自制的祖国国旗，一面揩拭眼泪，一面唱着“金日成将军之歌”乘上救护车回到开城。 【新华社开城三日电】五月二日又有五百名朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员通过板门店重归祖国。他们在美方救护车里就唱着“金日成将军之歌”，车门打开时，歌声和哭声混在一起。病伤人员下车以后，以最大的愤怒，把美方在遣返前强迫发给他们替换原来的破烂衣物的衬衣、大衣一起丢在地上。有一个人把发霉的“饭”丢在一个美军军官的脚下。许多人不愿意马上进入帐篷，他们瞪着美军军官，声泪俱下地喊着口号：“把我们从死亡之岛救出来的祖国万岁！”“朝鲜人民军万岁！”“中国人民志愿军万岁！”有许多人抱着我方接收人员放声痛哭。
    五月二日我方病伤被俘人员还带回来许多朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗，和两幅用鲜血写成的标语。
    很显然，我方被俘人员的这种愤怒情绪，是美方对待战俘政策的结果。在我方警卫人员和接收人员的维持下，我方接收区的秩序一直是良好的。但是五月二日美方管理军官却对病伤人员们这种难以抑制的愤怒情绪向我方提出“抗议”。当我方管理军官严正指出这种“抗议”的无理时，美方管理军官只好说：“我没有什么话说了。”
