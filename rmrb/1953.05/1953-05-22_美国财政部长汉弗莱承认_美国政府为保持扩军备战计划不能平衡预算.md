Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st: U.S. Treasury Secretary Humphrey recently testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the U.S. budget issue. In his testimony, he admitted that the Eisenhower administration decided not to fulfill its promise to balance the budget in the 1954 fiscal year, starting July 1 this year, because it wanted to maintain a massive military expansion and war preparations plan.

Humphrey said in his testimony that he believed "it should not" balance the budget in the 1954 fiscal year. He pointed out that about 65 to 70 percent of the government budget expenditure would be used for the so-called "national security plan," and half of the remaining part would be used to pay the interest on the huge national debt accumulated due to the war. Humphrey emphasized that these war expenditures could not or should not be reduced. Therefore, Humphrey said, "unless security is jeopardized," only 15 to 17 percent of the entire budget could be considered for reduction. This part is mainly the already small expenses directly related to the people's welfare, such as social insurance, welfare, and health care.

Humphrey admitted in his testimony that due to the decision to continue massive military spending, the government's budget would have a huge deficit. In order to make up for the lack of income, he said: "There is simply no other prospect than raising the maximum limit of the national debt." This means further increasing the already heavy burden of national debt on the people's shoulders. As a result of the war, the U.S. government's national debt is currently as high as nearly 266 billion U.S. dollars. On average, every American has to bear about 1,680 U.S. dollars, and the American people have to spend 6 or 7 billion U.S. dollars every year just to pay the interest on the national debt. The maximum limit of the national debt, which has been greatly increased by Congress, is 275 billion U.S. dollars. Humphrey requested that this limit be raised again.

### 美国财政部长汉弗莱承认  美国政府为保持扩军备战计划不能平衡预算

    美国财政部长汉弗莱承认
    美国政府为保持扩军备战计划不能平衡预算
    【新华社二十一日讯】华盛顿消息：美国财政部长汉弗莱最近曾就美国预算问题出席参议院外交委员会作证。他在作证中承认：艾森豪威尔政府决定不在从今年七月一日开始的一九五四财政年度中实现平衡预算的诺言，原因是要保持庞大的扩军备战计划。
    汉弗莱在作证中说，他认为“不应当”在一九五四年度平衡预算。他指出，政府预算开支百分之六十五至七十左右要用在所谓“国家安全计划”上，余下的部分又有一半要支付由于战争积累起来的庞大国债的利息。这些战争开支，汉弗莱强调，都是不能或者不应削减的。因此，汉弗莱说，“除非危及安全”，整个预算中就只有百分之十五至十七可以考虑削减。这一部分主要正是直接关系人民福利的已经为数很小的费用，例如社会保险、福利和卫生费之类。
    汉弗莱在作证中承认：由于决定继续庞大的军事开支，政府的预算将有巨大的赤字。为了弥补收入的不足，他说：“除了提高国家欠债的最高限额外，简直没有甚么别的前景。”这就是说要再增加人民肩上已经很重的国债负担。由于战争的结果，美国政府的国债目前已高达近二千六百六十亿美元。平均每一美国人要担负约一千六百八十美元，单是为了支付国债利息，美国人民每年就得花六、七十亿美元。国会规定的已经大为提高了的国债最高限额是二千七百五十亿美元。汉弗莱要求把这个限额再提高。
