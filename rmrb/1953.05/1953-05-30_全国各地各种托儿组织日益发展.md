    Childcare Services Develop in the Capital
    With the development of construction in Beijing, childcare, healthcare, and welfare services for children in the capital have also developed accordingly. The city now has 190 nurseries and childcare stations, an increase of more than 23% compared to 1952. More than 9,480 children are being cared for. There are now 33 maternal and child health centers in the city. Factories with a large number of female workers have gradually established or expanded their childcare facilities. Nurseries generally maintain close contact with Beijing's health departments and receive professional guidance from them.
    To improve the operation of nurseries, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau has trained various healthcare and childcare personnel. It started a healthcare worker training class in 1951 and last year conducted specialized training for nursery healthcare workers in the area of nutrition. The Maternal and Child Health Center Station of the Dongsi District Health Center specially printed booklets on how to make and use supplementary foods for children and distributed them to parents; it also held mothers' meetings to demonstrate the process using real objects. This work of adjusting children's diets under certain conditions greatly helps the normal development of children's bodies.

    Many Factories in Southwest China Establish Nurseries
    Many factories in Southwest China have established nurseries. There are now 77 nurseries, caring for more than 4,400 children.
    The children of workers live happily in the nurseries. They regularly eat meat, eggs, fruits, seaweed, and other foods. They have many toys. Caregivers often teach them songs and tell them stories. Nursery fees are very low, with full-day care generally costing 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month, and full-time care doubling that.
    The establishment of factory and mine nurseries has played a significant role in encouraging female workers to actively participate in production. Before liberation, female workers with children in Chongqing's yarn factories would put their children in yarn baskets or hide them in the toilets while they worked; they would only take their children away after work. After liberation, this situation disappeared. In particular, the establishment of nurseries in factories has freed female workers with children from worrying about their children, further promoting their enthusiasm for production. Since female workers with children at the 610 Yarn Factory sent their children to the nursery, many new things have emerged in production, and 28 female workers have been selected as model workers. Among the 30 mothers in the Shashi Yarn Factory nursery, 18 are model workers and advanced workers. Zhang Fuqun, a female worker at the Yuxin Yarn Factory's cloth workshop, increased her loom tending capacity from four to six looms after sending her child to the nursery. Many female workers with children have become more enthusiastic about learning culture, politics, and technology after sending their children to the nursery.
    In order to further develop welfare services for female workers and children in factories, the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chongqing Textile Workers' Union have successively held three training classes for nursery caregivers, training a total of more than 230 caregivers. The Chongqing Municipal People's Government Health Bureau's nursery caregiver training class, which will begin soon, is preparing to continue training caregivers for factory and mine nurseries.

    Henan Achieves Success in Organizing Farm Busy Season Nurseries
    The Health Bureau of the Central-South Administrative Committee dispatched maternal and child health workers to rural Henan on the 23rd to inspect childcare work. They will study the situation of childcare work and rural children's healthcare work in Henan and draw on its experience; then they will sort out and improve these experiences and gradually promote them in rural areas of the Central-South Region. After arriving in Henan, the inspectors will work with staff from relevant departments in Henan Province to conduct inspections in different types of areas.
    Rural childcare organizations in Henan Province have developed considerably in recent years. According to incomplete statistics from 35 counties alone, there are 199 nurseries and 7,235 baby-holding groups, providing relatively reasonable care for more than 59,000 children during the busy farming season.
    The establishment of rural childcare organizations has enabled rural women to devote more time to production activities and has generally improved production efficiency. In a mutual aid team in Muqiao Township, Sui County, 12 male laborers and 13 women only harvested 70 mu of wheat in three days in 1951. After the establishment of a baby-holding group in the summer of 1952, 7 male laborers and 13 women harvested 108 mu of wheat in two days.

    Nanjing Suburban Areas Train Nannies for Farm Busy Season Nurseries
    The nanny training class for farm busy season nurseries jointly organized by the Women's Federation and Health Center in the suburban areas of Nanjing has been very effective. The training class spent three days providing nannies with childcare education. The content included scientific knowledge such as new childcare methods, basic knowledge of children's hygiene, and prevention and first aid for common diseases.
    There are more than 100 farm busy season nurseries in the six suburban districts of Nanjing. Before the children started to gather, more than 90 nannies participated in the training class. After three days of training, they criticized unhygienic and unscientific childcare methods of the past, understood the principles of simple and easy disinfection methods such as sun exposure and boiling water, and learned about the use of common external medicines such as iodine, eye drops, and black ointment; they understood the prevention and treatment methods for infectious diseases such as trachoma, measles, and scabies. In order to provide simple and practical medicines for farm busy season nurseries, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Health Bureau has made many medicine boxes with commonly used medicines and distributed them to each nursery for reserve.

### 全国各地各种托儿组织日益发展

    全国各地各种托儿组织日益发展
    首都托儿事业有发展
    随着北京市建设事业的发展，首都儿童的保育、保健工作和福利事业也相适应地发展了。全市现有托儿所、托儿站一百九十所，较一九五二年增加了百分之二十三以上。受托的儿童共有九千四百八十多人。全市的妇幼保健站已有三十三处。女工较多的工厂，都逐渐地建立了托儿所或扩大了托儿所的组织。一般托儿所都和北京市卫生部门建立了密切的联系，并接受卫生部门在业务上的指导。
    为了办好托儿所，北京市人民政府公共卫生局训练了各种保健和保育人材。在一九五一年即开办了保健员训练班，去年又向各托儿所的保健员进行了营养业务方面的专门训练。东四区卫生所妇幼保健中心站特地印制了关于儿童副食品的制作法与供用法的小册子，分发给儿童家长们；还召开了母亲会，用实物示范做给她们看。这种在一定条件下注意调剂儿童饮食的工作，大大有助于儿童身体的正常发育。
    西南许多工厂设立了托儿所
    西南区许多工厂都设立了托儿所。现在共有托儿所七十七个，受托儿童四千四百多人。
    工人的孩子们在托儿所过着幸福的生活。孩子们经常吃到肉、蛋、水果、海菜等。他们有很多玩具。保育员经常教他们唱歌，并讲故事给他们听。托儿所收费很低，日托一般是四万元到五万元一月，全托增加一倍。
    厂矿托儿所的建立，对鼓励女工积极生产起了很大作用。解放前，重庆各纱厂有孩子的女工上班时，把小孩放在纱篓里或者藏在厕所中；下班时，才把孩子带走。解放后，这种情形再也没有出现了。特别是在工厂建立托儿所后，就给有孩子的女工解除了对孩子们的牵挂，进一步发挥她们在生产上的积极性。六一○纱厂有孩子的女工，自从把孩子送进托儿所后，生产上出现许多新气象，有二十八名女工当选为劳动模范。沙市纱厂托儿所三十个母亲中，有十八人是劳动模范和先进工作者。渝新纱厂布场女工张富群把孩子送进托儿所后，看台能力从四台增加到六台。许多有孩子的女工把孩子送进托儿所后，她们学习文化、政治和技术的积极性更加提高了。
    为了进一步开展工厂中的女工、儿童福利事业，中华全国总工会西南办事处和重庆市纺织工会，曾先后开办了三期托儿所保育人员训练班，共训练出保育人员二百三十多名。最近重庆市人民政府卫生局举办的托儿所保育人员训练班即将开学，准备继续为厂矿托儿所训练保育人员。
    河南举办农忙托儿所有成绩
    中南行政委员会卫生局在二十三日派出妇幼卫生工作人员到河南农村中视察托儿工作。他们将研究河南农村托儿工作以及农村儿童保健工作的状况并吸取其经验；而后将这些经验加以整理提高，逐步在中南区农村中推广。视察人员到达河南后，将会同河南省有关部门的工作人员，深入不同类型地区，进行考察。
    河南省农村托儿组织，几年来有相当的发展。仅据三十五个县的不完全统计，就有一百九十九个托儿所，七千二百三十五个抱娃娃组，使五万九千多个小孩在农忙季节得到比较合理的照顾。
    农村托儿组织的建立，使农妇们能够抽出更多的时间参加生产活动，而且一般地提高了生产效率。睢县木桥乡一个互助组里，一九五一年十二个男劳动力和十三个妇女，三天只割七十亩麦子。一九五二年夏天成立抱娃娃组以后，七个男劳动力和十三个妇女，两天就割了一百零八亩麦子。
    南京市郊区训练农忙托儿所保姆
    南京市郊区妇女联合会和卫生所联合举办的农忙托儿所保姆训练班，收效很好。训练班以三天时间，向保姆进行儿童保育教育。内容包括新育儿法、儿童卫生常识、普通疾病的预防和急救法等科学知识。
    南京市六个郊区有一百多个农忙托儿所。在开始集中儿童以前，参加训练班学习的保姆有九十多人，经过三天的训练，她们批判了过去不卫生不科学的保育方法，懂得了太阳曝晒、开水煮沸等简而易行的消毒方法的道理，学会了关于碘酒、眼药水、黑药膏等一般的外用药品的使用法；懂得了砂眼、麻疹、疥疮等传染疾病的防治方法。为了供给农忙托儿所简单实用的药品，南京市人民政府卫生局做了不少常用药品的药箱，发给各个托儿所备用。        （新华社）
