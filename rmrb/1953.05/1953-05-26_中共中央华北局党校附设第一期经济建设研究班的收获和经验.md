The First Economic Construction Research Class Attached to the North China Bureau Party School of the CCP Central Committee began on February 2nd and ended on April 27th this year. The purpose of the research class was to train teachers for in-service cadres to study economic construction theory in the coming year. A total of forty-nine cadres formally participated in the research class. Among them, twenty-five were engaged in industry, agriculture, trade, and cooperative work, and twenty-four were engaged in propaganda and education work. Generally speaking, comrades who originally worked in economic fields had considerable practical work experience, while comrades who originally worked in propaganda and education had some basic theoretical knowledge. Organizing these two groups of comrades together for learning was very beneficial for mutual assistance. Throughout the entire learning process, the enthusiasm for learning remained high, and it increased as they learned more.

The study materials for the research class were: Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", a portion of Lenin's and Stalin's works on socialist economic construction, and some instructions from our Party Central Committee regarding economic construction. The learning method adopted the principle of "less but refined", with self-study as the main focus, supplemented by lectures and special reports. Teachers were invited to explain Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Regarding issues of China's economic construction, leading comrades at the North China level were invited to give special reports.

The teaching policy and steps of the research class first required in-depth study of Lenin's and Stalin's theories on socialist economic construction and Soviet experiences, with emphasis, and then combined this with the study of the main policy issues and ideological issues that urgently needed to be resolved in our country's current economic construction. According to the teaching policy, the research class emphasized the following three points when studying the theories and experiences of Soviet socialist economic construction:

One, study the basic theories and main experiences of Soviet socialist economic construction with emphasis but not in isolation. The theories and experiences of Soviet socialist construction are extremely rich, and it is difficult for a short-term research class to conduct extensive research in all aspects; therefore, the principle of "less but refined" must be adopted, and study should be conducted with emphasis. This time, the focus was on studying: the theory of the transition from capitalism to socialism, Lenin's New Economic Policy doctrine, socialist industrialization, socialist collectivization of agriculture, socialist commerce, the building of socialism, and the leadership role of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet state in socialist economic construction. In order to enable everyone to concentrate on studying the main issues, on the one hand, the greed for more ideas among the students and the thinking of some comrades who only paid attention to specific business issues and did not seriously read and study theory were criticized; on the other hand, research outlines were compiled, highlighting the main issues, specifying the reference books, and the steps and time for learning, and teachers were invited to give more detailed explanations on the main issues. At the same time, attention was also paid to guiding everyone to pay attention to the Soviet Union's international and domestic environment at that time, the relationship between politics and economic construction, the relationship between various economic components within the national economy, and the relationship between industry, agriculture, and trade when studying the main issues, so as to avoid the isolation of the study focus. Experience in learning has proved that this "both focused and non-isolated" learning method is not only very beneficial for understanding the theories and experiences of Soviet socialist economic construction, but also makes everyone take a step forward in their thinking: understanding how to analyze problems according to specific circumstances, how to find the key and essence of problems, how to find the central link from the overall work, and how to examine departmental work from a global perspective, so as to better serve the central work. In this way, everyone can more realistically feel the importance of their work, strengthen their sense of responsibility for their work, and overcome one-sidedness and blindness in their thinking.

In the entire teaching process, this method was generally correctly used. However, there are still shortcomings. The main one is that the issue of the worker-peasant alliance was not clearly raised when studying Chapter 9, and Chapter 12 inappropriately emphasized the Soviet Constitution as the center of research, while the issue of building socialism was put in a secondary position. In addition, at the beginning of the study, only the emphasis was on grasping the key points to study the main issues, and not enough attention was paid to the Soviet Union's international and domestic situation at that time. Some of these deviations have been corrected later.

Two, learn the theories and experiences of Soviet socialist economic construction from the historical development of the Soviet Union. Regarding the issues of Soviet socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, when studying, they were all narrated from the October Socialist Revolution to the building of socialism, with Chapters 10 and 11 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" as the center. The advantage of this kind of learning is that it can clearly understand the specific path and basic laws of the development of Soviet socialist industry and agriculture, and can understand under what circumstances Lenin and Stalin put forward what theories, how they developed and enriched these theories under new circumstances, and how the CPSU (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet state formulated policies and specific measures based on Lenin's and Stalin's theories at that time. In this way, it is convenient for everyone to learn from the theories and experiences of Soviet construction according to China's specific situation. For this reason, this teaching paid attention to conducting systematic research according to historical years. A comprehensive study was conducted on the important situations and issues related to economic construction before Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", and relevant important works of Lenin and Stalin before 1921 were appropriately selected for reading. Although some problems and documents were repeatedly studied when studying Soviet socialist industrial construction and agricultural collectivization separately, this repetition is unavoidable, and sometimes it is necessary, which is beneficial and harmless. Of course, excessive and unnecessary repetition is not good.

Three, when studying the theories and experiences of Soviet socialist economic construction, always pay attention to the issue of fighting against opposition factions and various enemies. In this way, comrades can see that socialist construction is still a road of arduous struggle, so as to make their minds clearer, improve their vigilance, and more firmly believe that they can overcome any difficulties. Of course, it is not right to specialize in studying the wrong arguments of the opposition factions instead of better understanding Lenin's and Stalin's theories. In addition, it is also wrong to arbitrarily put the hat of the opposition faction on comrades who have some similar views, saying that a certain comrade is the same as Pyatakov.

According to the teaching policy, the research class emphasized the following two points when using the theories and experiences of Soviet socialist economic construction to study China's economic construction issues:

One, starting from China's social and economic conditions, we must first distinguish the differences between China's and the Soviet Union's specific situations and specific conditions, and at the same time, we must see that the direction and path of China's and the Soviet Union's economic construction are consistent. It is wrong not to distinguish. Some comrades have had the situation of learning from the Soviet Union without asking about the conditions and only learning the conclusions. There are also some comrades who, sometimes after seeing a paragraph of discussion in a book or hearing a report, want to deal with the current work problems in the same way as soon as possible. This kind of application of Soviet experience is dogmatic and formalistic, which is very dangerous. This is often one of the reasons for the blind advance and deviation in work. It is also wrong not to see the consistency of the direction and path of China's and the Soviet Union's economic construction. Some comrades have reviewed the past overemphasis on the differences between China and the Soviet Union, and overestimated their past experience, so they are unwilling to use or dare not accept Soviet experience, and do not study Lenin's and Stalin's theories on economic construction. This is not understanding the guiding role of Lenin's and Stalin's theories in our work, and not understanding the great significance of Soviet experience to our work. This is often one of the reasons for the conservative deviation.

Two, focus on studying the Party's current economic construction guidelines and policies, establish correct thinking, and criticize erroneous views. Due to the short study time of the research class, it is impossible to study all aspects of China's economic construction, and we can only concentrate our efforts on studying the several most important issues in the current economic construction work.

In terms of industry: First of all, the issue of industrial construction guidelines was studied. It was found in the study that "large-scale economic construction" and "industrialization" are very vague abstract concepts for many comrades, and even some comrades who are engaged in industrial work do not know much about the guidelines for industrial construction. In this way, it is inevitable that our industrial construction will encounter more difficulties. This time, after studying the theories and experiences of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, and then studying the issue of industrial construction guidelines in our country, we especially felt that our eyes were brightened, and we deeply realized that the Central Committee's construction guidelines were formulated based on Lenin's and Stalin's theories on industrialization and the actual situation of our country; we realized the importance of industrialization, especially the importance of first developing heavy industry and carrying out basic construction with emphasis; we realized the far-reaching significance of Chairman Mao's call to "take the road of the Russians" and "learn from the Soviet Union." And consciously criticized the idea that he did not really pay attention to industrial construction in practice. Secondly, the relationship between industrial construction and various tasks was studied. From an ideological point of view, localism and departmentalism that disregarded the overall situation, and the idea of blind development and everything being revived that disregarded the national plan were criticized. On the issue of the relationship between the central government and the local governments, some comrades reviewed the past mistakes of not being able to understand the central government's unified management of large enterprises and the large-scale transfer of cadres and funds, and thinking that the local industry had no future. Some comrades also reviewed the past mistakes of coming to the central government and the North China Bureau for meetings, demanding "more money and more power," and realized that it is impossible to realize national industrialization without the unified and centralized leadership of the central government; and without national industrialization, other tasks would not be able to develop highly. On the issue of the relationship between industry, agriculture, trade, and other departments, many comrades reviewed the mistake of having a weak concept of the national plan: in the past, they mostly "worked alone" in isolation, and paid very little attention to mutual cooperation, especially how to serve the national industrial construction. There was great blindness in the work, and some uncoordinated phenomena often occurred between each other, which increased the difficulty of the work. After learning, a global perspective was established, and it was realized the appropriate position of their work in the entire work, and the direction of their efforts.

In terms of agriculture: the focus was on studying the Party's policies in rural areas, the development law of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Party's current mutual aid and cooperation policy, and the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, etc., and criticized the erroneous tendencies of blind advance and commandism. The study started with a specific analysis of the current rural economic situation and the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy. It can be seen from the study that many comrades have a very poor understanding of the rural economic situation and the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, and have not seriously considered what profound significance these characteristics have for the Party's policies and for practical work; therefore, confusion occurs in their thinking, and errors occur when implementing the Party's policies. When studying the current development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, organizational forms, development laws, and the various conditions for developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it can be seen that many comrades' understanding of these issues in the past was vague. This time, after analyzing and studying the specific materials of blind advance and commandism in rural work based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee, Lenin's and Stalin's theories on the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, and the experience of the Soviet Union, the understanding of the Central Committee's mutual aid and cooperation policy and the main issues in the current work is much deeper; the understanding of the relationship between agriculture and various tasks, especially industry, is also clearer.

In terms of commerce: the focus was on studying the role of commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives in economic construction, studying the relationship between state-owned trade, cooperatives, and private trade, and the issue of price policy. Attention was paid to criticizing the supply system thinking of state-owned trade and cooperatives.

In addition, when studying issues in all aspects, attention was paid to the issue of how to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership and propaganda and education work to serve economic construction. Comrades engaged in propaganda and education work have also reviewed their past work.

After this study, everyone deeply felt the importance of studying theory; not only did they express that they would continue to work hard to study theory in practice based on this study, but they also determined to do a good job in theoretical study in their own departments and regions.

    中共中央华北局党校附设第一期经济建设研究班的收获和经验
    中共中央华北局宣传部
    中共中央华北局党校附设第一期经济建设研究班于今年二月二日开始，四月二十七日结束。研究班的目的是为今明年在职干部学习经济建设理论训练教员。正式参加研究班学习的干部共四十九人。其中作工业、农业、贸易、合作社等工作的二十五人，作宣传教育工作的二十四人。一般说来，原作经济工作的同志有不少实际工作经验，原作宣传教育工作的同志有一些基本理论知识，两部分同志组织在一起学习，在互相帮助上很有好处。在全部学习过程中，学习情绪始终饱满，而且是愈学情绪愈高。
    研究班的学习材料是：“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章，列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设的一部分著作及我党中央一部分有关经济建设的指示。学习方法采取“少而精”的原则，以自学为主，辅之以讲授和专题报告。请教员讲解了“联共
    （布）党史”第九章至第十二章和“苏联社会主义经济问题”。有关中国经济建设的问题，请了华北一级负责同志作了专题报告。
    研究班的教学方针和步骤，首先要求有重点地深入研究列宁、斯大林关于社会主义经济建设的理论和苏联的经验，然后结合研究我国当前经济建设中最迫切需要解决的主要政策问题和思想问题。根据教学方针，在学习苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和经验时，研究班强调注意以下三点：
    一、有重点地而又不孤立地研究苏联社会主义经济建设的基本理论和主要经验。苏联社会主义建设的理论和经验是极其丰富的，对短期的研究班来说，要从各方面进行广泛地研究是有困难的；因此必须采取“少而精”的原则，有重点地进行学习。这次着重研究的是：关于从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期的理论、列宁的新经济政策学说、社会主义国家工业化、社会主义农业集体化、社会主义商业、社会主义建成和联共（布）党、苏维埃国家在社会主义经济建设中的领导作用等问题。为了使大家集中精力研究主要问题，一方面批判了学员中的贪多思想和部分同志只注意具体业务问题而不认真读书钻研理论的思想；一方面编写了研究提纲，提示了主要问题，规定了参考书目和学习的步骤与时间，又请教员对主要问题作了较详细的讲解。同时也注意引导大家在学习主要问题时，注意苏联当时的国际国内环境、政治与经济建设的关系、国民经济内部各种经济成份间的关系、工业农业贸易之间的关系，以免使学习重点陷于孤立。学习中的经验证明：这种“既有重点又不孤立”的学习方法，不仅对领会苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和经验很有好处，而且使大家在思想上也提高了一步：懂得了如何根据具体情况分析问题，如何找到问题的关键和本质，如何从全盘工作中找出中心环节，从全局观点考察部门工作，以便更好地为中心工作服务。这样就可使大家更切实地感到自己工作的重要，加强了工作责任心，克服了思想上的片面性和盲目性。
    在全部教学过程中，一般是正确运用了这一方法的。但仍有缺点。主要是学习第九章时对工农联盟问题提得不够明显，学习第十二章时不恰当地强调了以苏联新宪法为研究中心，而把建成社会主义问题放到了次要地位。此外，在开始学习时只强调了抓住重点研究主要问题，对联系苏联当时国际国内情况注意不够。其中有些偏差以后都纠正了。
    二、从苏联历史的发展学习苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和经验。关于苏联社会主义国家工业化和农业集体化问题，学习时，都是从十月社会主义革命一直叙述到社会主义建成，而以“联共（布）党史”第十章和第十一章为中心来学习的。这样学习的好处是：可以清楚地了解苏联社会主义工业和农业发展的具体道路和基本规律，可以领会列宁、斯大林在什么情况下提出了什么理论，在新的情况下又怎样发展和丰富了这些理论，以及当时联共（布）党和苏维埃国家怎样根据列宁、斯大林的理论制定政策和具体措施。这样，便于大家根据中国具体情况，学习苏联建设的理论和经验。为此，这次在教学中注意了按照历史年代进行系统的研究。对“联共（布）党史”第九章以前有关经济建设的重要情况和问题，作了综合研究，并适当选读了一九二一年以前列宁、斯大林的有关重要著作。虽然在分别研究苏联社会主义工业建设和农业集体化时，又重复研究了一些问题和文件，但这种重复是不可避免的，有时也是需要的，是有益无害的。当然过多的不必要的重复是不好的。
    三、研究苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和经验时，要时刻注意到与反对派及各种敌人作斗争的问题。这样可以使同志们看到，社会主义建设依然是一个艰苦斗争的道路，以便使头脑更加清醒，提高警惕，并更加坚信能够克服任何困难。当然，不是为了更好地领会列宁、斯大林的理论而是专去钻研反对派的错误论点，是不对的。另外，把反对派的帽子随便套在有某些类似观点的同志头上，说某个同志和皮达可夫一样，也是不对的。
    根据教学方针，在运用苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和经验来研究中国经济建设问题时，研究班强调注意以下两点：
    一、从中国社会经济情况出发，首先要区别开我国和苏联具体情况和具体条件的不同，同时又要看到我国与苏联经济建设的方向和道路是一致的。如果不加区别是不对的。有些同志曾有过学习苏联不问条件只学结论的情况。也有些同志，有时从书上看到一段论述或听过一个报告，就想赶快照样处理当前的工作问题。这样运用苏联经验，是教条主义的、形式主义的，很危险。这常常是工作中盲目冒进偏向产生的原因之一。看不到我国与苏联经济建设的方向和道路的一致也是不对的。有的同志检讨过去过分强调我国与苏联不同，过高估计了自己过去的经验，因而不愿意运用或不敢接受苏联的经验，不去研究列宁、斯大林关于经济建设的理论。这是不了解列宁、斯大林的理论对我们工作的指导作用，不了解苏联的经验对我们工作帮助的巨大意义。这常常是保守主义偏向产生的原因之一。
    二、有重点地研究当前党的经济建设方针、政策，树立正确思想，批判错误观点。由于研究班学习时间短，不可能把中国经济建设各方面的问题都展开研究，只能集中力量研究当前经济建设工作中几个最主要的问题。
    在工业方面：首先研究了工业建设的方针问题。学习中发现：“大规模经济建设”、“工业化”对不少同志来说，是一个很模糊的抽象的概念，甚至有些作工业工作的同志，对工业建设的方针也了解得不大清楚。这样就不可避免地使我们的工业建设遭到更多的困难。这次，经过学习苏联社会主义国家工业化的理论和经验以后，再来研究我国工业建设的方针问题，特别感到眼前明亮了，深刻地认识到中央的建设方针，正是根据列宁、斯大林关于工业化的理论和我国的实际情况制定出来的；体会到工业化特别是首先发展重工业和有重点地进行基本建设的重要意义；体会到毛主席号召“走俄国人的路”、“学习苏联”意义的深远。并自觉地批判了自己实际上并没有真正重视工业建设的思想。其次，研究了工业建设与各种工作的关系问题。从思想上批判了不顾全局的地方主义、本位主义思想，不顾国家计划的盲目发展、百废俱兴的思想。在中央与地方的关系问题上，有些同志检讨了过去对中央统一管理大企业、大量调集干部和资金思想不通，认为地方工业没有前途的错误。也有些同志检讨了过去到中央和华北局来开会，要求“多分点钱，多分点权”的错误，认识到没有中央统一集中的领导，是不可能实现国家工业化的；而没有国家工业化，其他各种工作也就不可能有高度发展。在工业、农业、贸易等各部门间的关系问题上，许多同志检讨了对国家计划观念薄弱的错误：过去多是孤立地
    “单干”，互相配合特别是如何服务于国家工业建设，注意得很差。工作中有很大盲目性，互相间也常常发生一些不协调现象，增加了工作上的困难。经过学习，树立了全局观点，并且认识到自己的工作在全部工作中的适当位置，和自己的努力方向。
    在农业方面：着重研究了党在农村中的政策、互助合作运动的发展规律、目前党的互助合作方针以及自愿互利原则等问题，批判了盲目冒进和命令主义等错误倾向。学习是从具体分析当前农村经济情况和小农经济的特点开始的。从学习中看出，许多同志对农村经济情况和小农经济的特点了解很差，也没有认真考虑过，这些特点究竟对党的政策、对实际工作具有什么深刻意义；因而在思想上发生混乱，在执行党的政策时发生错误。在研究当前互助合作运动发展情况、组织形式、发展规律以及发展互助合作运动的各种条件等问题时，可以看出不少同志过去对这些问题的认识是模糊的。这次，根据党中央的指示、列宁和斯大林关于改造小农经济的理论和苏联的经验，分析研究了农村工作中盲目冒进和命令主义的具体材料以后，对中央的互助合作政策及当前工作中的主要问题，了解是深刻得多了；对于农业与各种工作特别是与工业的关系，认识的也更加明确了。
    在商业方面：着重研究了商业和供销合作社在经济建设中的作用，研究了国营贸易、合作社、私营贸易的关系，以及价格政策问题。注意批判了国营贸易与合作社的供给制思想。
    此外，在学习各方面的问题时，都曾经注意到加强党的政治思想领导和宣传教育工作应如何为经济建设服务的问题。作宣传教育工作的同志，也都对过去工作作了检讨。
    经过这次学习，大家深深感到学习理论的重要；不仅自己表示要在此次学习的基础上继续在实际工作中努力钻研理论，而且决心要把本部门本地区的理论学习搞好。
