Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 25th: A "Pravda" observer, Kolionov, commenting on the travels of US Secretary of State Dulles and Mutual Security Agency Director Stassen in the Near East, Middle East, and South Asia, said: The reaction of all Arab countries to this trip is almost the same. Everywhere, thousands of people took to the streets under slogans such as "Arab problems can only be solved by the Arabs themselves," "Down with aggressive joint defense pacts," and "Arab countries belong to the Arab people," to hold demonstrations. The will of the entire Arab people to strive for freedom and independence has been manifested in these people's demonstrations.

For many years, London and Washington have been exerting pressure on Arab countries in an attempt to get them to join American and British military plans. Since the emergence of the "Middle East Command" plan in the autumn of 1951, this pressure has been particularly intensified. As everyone knows, this plan stipulates that the troops and headquarters of the American and British blocs can be stationed on the territory of the Near East and Middle Eastern countries, and that Western countries can establish and expand a network of military bases within these countries. This means the actual occupation of Arab countries by the armies of the Atlantic Alliance organizers. For example, this is particularly evident in Egypt. The most important areas of Egypt, especially the Suez Canal Zone, remain under the control of British troops.

What position does the United States take on this issue, which is of the utmost importance to Arab countries?

On the surface, Dulles' position on the issue of the continued foreign occupation of the Suez Canal Zone is no different from that of Britain. However, foreign newspapers correctly point out that Washington and London have different opinions on this very issue. The Beirut newspaper "Al-Nida" said: "The British want to set up a 'joint defense' system under its direct influence and limited to Arab countries. The Americans want to establish a group including Arab countries, Israel, and Turkey in order to guarantee a pro-American majority vote." The newspaper continued: "The US plan to establish a Middle East Command aims to kill two birds with one stone: to tie this group to the North Atlantic Alliance, and at the same time to establish a new African group as soon as possible." The newspaper pointed out that the "African" group will be composed of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Spain. "The composition of this group will guarantee that American imperialism will have control over the four coasts of the Mediterranean."

London does not welcome this news. A London-based correspondent for the Pakistani newspaper "Dawn" said that until now, Britain still believes that its influence in the countries Dulles is currently visiting is paramount. The reporter said that this is the reason why Britain feels uneasy about Dulles' trip.

Kolionov pointed out that the Arab countries' newspapers' comments on Dulles' trip confirm two tendencies. On the issue of consolidating their common and advantageous military positions in the territories of dependent countries, the United States and Britain generally take unified actions. However, on the issue of economic interests, they are always opposed to each other. Therefore, the new plan regarding Dulles' trip reported by the Arab newspapers is clearly directed at Britain.

Referring to the reaction of the broad masses of the Arab people to this plan, Kolionov quoted a public letter to Dulles published by the famous Egyptian journalist Fasa on the day Dulles arrived in Cairo. The letter said: "You should understand that these countries belong to the Arabs, not to you. These countries are unwilling to follow the British, the Turks, or the North Atlantic Group..."

Kolionov concluded by saying that in Washington and London, some politicians want to ignore the Arab people's will to defend freedom and independence. However, facts show that these politicians are wrong.

    “真理报”评论杜勒斯在近东、中东、南亚的阴谋活动
    美英军事计划引起阿拉伯广大人民的反对
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：“真理报”观察员科里奥诺夫评论美国国务卿杜勒斯和共同安全署署长史塔生在近东、中东、南亚的旅行说：所有阿拉伯国家对这次旅行的反应差不多是一样的。每个地方都有成千人民在“阿拉伯问题只能由阿拉伯人自己解决”、“打倒侵略性的共同防御公约”、“阿拉伯国家属于阿拉伯人民”等口号下，在街上举行示威。阿拉伯国家全体人民争取自由和独立的意志，已在这些人民的示威中表现出来。
    多年来，伦敦和华盛顿方面一直在对阿拉伯国家施用压力，企图使它们加入美英军事计划。自从一九五一年秋天“中东司令部”计划出现以来，这种压力已特别加强。大家知道，这个计划规定美英集团的军队和司令部可以驻扎在近东、中东国家的领土上，西方国家在这些国家内可以建立并扩充军事基地网。这就意味着大西洋联盟组织者的军队实际占领阿拉伯国家。例如，这特别明显地表现在埃及。埃及的最重要的地区，特别是苏彝士运河区，仍然在英国军队控制之下。
    美国在这个对于阿拉伯国家具有最大重要性的问题上，采取什么立场呢？
    表面看来，杜勒斯对于外国继续占领苏彝士运河区问题的立场，和英国的立场毫无不同的地方。但是，外国报纸正确地指出，华盛顿和伦敦就是在这个问题上存在着各种不同意见。贝鲁特“呼声报”说：“英国人要设立一个在它直接影响下并只局限于阿拉伯国家的‘共同防御’系统。美国人却要建立一个包括阿拉伯国家、以色列和土耳其的集团，以便保证可得到亲美的多数票。”报纸继续说：“美国设立一个中东司令部的计划，目的是一箭双雕：把这个集团和北大西洋联盟绑在一起，同时又尽早建立一个新的非洲集团。”报纸指出，“非洲”集团将由利比亚、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和西班牙组成。“这个集团的组成将可保证美帝国主义在地中海的四面海岸掌握着支配权。”
    伦敦方面不欢迎这种消息。巴基斯坦“黎明报”驻伦敦记者说，到现在为止，英国仍相信它在杜勒斯目前所访问的国家中的影响是超过一切的。这个记者说，这就是英国对于杜勒斯的旅行感到不安的理由。
    科里奥诺夫指出，阿拉伯国家的报纸对于杜勒斯的旅行的评论证实了两种倾向。对于在附属国领土上巩固它们的共同有利的军事阵地问题上，美英大致是采取统一的行动的。但在经济利益问题上，它们总是互相反对的。因此，阿拉伯报纸报道的有关杜勒斯的旅行的新计划，它的矛头显然是指向英国。
    科里奥诺夫在提到阿拉伯国家广大人士对这种计划的反应时，引用了埃及著名新闻界人士法萨在杜勒斯到达开罗的一天发表的给杜勒斯的公开信。这封信说：“你应该了解，这些国家是属于阿拉伯人的，而不属于你。这些国家不愿跟在英国人、土耳其人或北大西洋集团的后面……。”
    科里奥诺夫的结语说，在华盛顿和伦敦，有些政客想不理睬阿拉伯人民保卫自由和独立的意志。但是，事实表明，这些政客们错了。
