The great friendship among the people of the socialist and people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union is one of the most important legacies that the immortal Stalin left to all mankind. From this brotherly friendship, the people of all countries have seen an unprecedented international relationship in human history, a guarantee of world peace, and the bright prospect of a future world of great harmony.

In the book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Stalin made a classic analysis of the friendly and cooperative relationship between the people of the socialist camp countries: "The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can give the people's democratic countries such genuine help and technically sophisticated help as the Soviet Union. The point is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The point is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is a sincere desire for mutual assistance and common economic upsurge. As a result, there has been a high rate of industrial development in these countries."

The Soviet Union's very favorable loans to the people's democratic countries, equal and mutually beneficial trade, and sophisticated scientific and technological assistance have enabled the economies of the people's democratic countries to develop rapidly. Compared with the pre-war industrial level (assumed to be 100) in 1952, Poland was 346.6, Czechoslovakia was 200.6, Bulgaria was 542.8, Hungary was 309, Romania was 233.7, the German Democratic Republic was 136, and Albania was 750. The industrial production of the People's Republic of China in 1952 also exceeded the highest level before liberation, and this is inseparable from the Soviet Union's assistance. For example, the Sino-Soviet loan agreement in 1950 stipulated that the Soviet Union would lend China 300 million US dollars within five years for China to order various machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union. Various machinery equipment and industrial materials accounted for the vast majority of China's imports from the Soviet Union, and the prices of these machinery equipment and industrial materials were on average 20% to 30% lower than the market prices in Britain and the United States. Along with a large number of machinery equipment and industrial materials came the Soviet Union's generous assistance in advanced science and technology. A large number of Soviet experts and technicians were sent to China. These experts and technicians had a noble purpose, which was to help the Chinese people realize industrialization. They worked as hard in China as they did in their own country, vigorously promoting the saving of funds, foreign exchange, and materials, and meticulously exploring the potential of industry. They made China's long-abandoned and useless machines turn again, transformed old-fashioned machines into new-fashioned machines, and taught Chinese workers to use these machines according to the Soviet Union's advanced working methods. In order to enable China to smoothly start its first five-year plan, the Soviet government and people are giving China more extensive economic and technical assistance, the scale of which will reach an unprecedented level.

The democratic and socialist camp countries have formed a new world market that is increasingly strong and prosperous and stands in opposition to the capitalist world market. Facts have proved that the inexhaustible natural resources and continuously developing industrial products of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are sufficient to fully supply each other's growing economic needs. In 1952, the Soviet Union's trade with the people's democratic countries accounted for 80% of its total foreign trade; China's trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries accounted for 72% of its total foreign trade. In 1952, the total amount of Soviet Union's trade with the people's democratic countries increased by 22% compared with 1951; in 1952, the total amount of China's trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries increased by 187.64% compared with 1950. There is no doubt that the high-speed development of industry in the democratic and socialist camp countries will soon confirm Stalin's prediction: "These countries not only do not need to import goods from capitalist countries, but they themselves will feel the need to export their surplus goods to other countries."

With the development of economic cooperation, increasingly frequent cultural exchanges are taking place among the democratic and socialist camp countries. From 1949 to 1952, a total of 22 delegations were sent from China to the Soviet Union, and a total of 18 delegations were sent from the Soviet Union to China. A total of 57 delegations were sent from China to the people's democratic countries, and a total of 47 delegations were sent from the people's democratic countries to China. A total of seven literary and artistic work groups were sent from China to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and a total of ten literary and artistic work groups were sent from various countries to China. More than 43,700 exhibitions introducing the Soviet Union were held in China, with more than 124,370,000 visitors; a total of 37 exhibitions introducing the European people's democratic countries were held, with more than 4,249,000 visitors. The mutual translation of books from various countries and the mutual introduction of films and works of art from various countries have become indispensable factors in people's cultural life.

The people of the democratic and socialist camp countries, united by common interests and common ideals, are completely united politically. The glorious road taken by Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an example and inspiration for all people's democratic countries. The Soviet Union's generous and selfless assistance is an indispensable condition for the people of all people's democratic countries to achieve victory and continue to move forward. Completely contrary to the relations between capitalist countries, which are full of mutual conflicts, deception, plunder, and aggression, what exists between the socialist and people's democratic countries and between the people of various countries is mutual trust, mutual respect, and mutual assistance. The heroic struggle of the great Soviet army in the liberation cause of the people of the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia, and the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean anti-aggression war, which took the Soviet army as an example, are monuments to this lofty friendship full of self-sacrificing spirit among the people of the democratic and socialist camp countries. The people of the democratic and socialist camp countries hold a common view on the fundamental issues of world politics, that is, they advocate maintaining lasting peace and oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the threat of new wars. The people of the democratic and socialist camp countries warmly support the struggle to defend peace and are making the greatest efforts to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and other international disputes.

This completely harmonious and friendly international relationship, as Comrade Malenkov said, "is an example of a completely new relationship between countries, a relationship that has never existed in history." This lofty friendship is a vivid manifestation of the internationalist spirit of the victorious working people of all countries. The interests of the working people of all countries are consistent with each other, and the interests of the victorious working people of all countries are consistent with the interests of all mankind. Because of this, the friendship of the people of the democratic and socialist camp countries is invincible and cannot be separated by any force. Of course, the warmongers who only know how to enslave and plunder the people of other countries, who only know how to prepare for and wage wars of aggression in pursuit of maximum capitalist profits, will never understand this friendship, just as they can never destroy this friendship. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "The Greatest Friendship": "The friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet people is unbreakable because our friendship is based on the great internationalist principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of all people's democratic countries, and the friendship between the people of all countries in the world who love peace, democracy, and
   justice, is also based on such great internationalist principles, and therefore, it is also unbreakable." Let us hold up the great
   banner of internationalism even higher!

May the great friendship of the people of the democratic and socialist camp countries created by the great Stalin
   continue to develop and remain eternally new!

    民主社会主义阵营各国人民的伟大友谊
    ——为“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”作
    中国共产党中央政治局委员　朱德
    以苏联为首的社会主义和人民民主主义各国人民间的伟大友谊，是不朽的斯大林遗留给全人类的最重要遗产之一。各国人民从这种兄弟般的友谊中看到了人类历史上空前未有的一种国际关系，看到世界和平的保证，看到未来的大同世界的光明远景。
    在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中，斯大林给社会主义阵营各国人民的友好合作关系作了经典式的分析：“这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高速度的工业发展。”
    苏联对各人民民主国家的十分优惠的贷款，平等互利的贸易和精湛的科学技术的援助，使各人民民主国家的经济都有了迅速的发展。以一九五二年的工业水平与战前（假定为一○○）相比，波兰为三四六·六，捷克斯洛伐克为二○○·六，保加利亚为五四二·八，匈牙利为三○九，罗马尼亚为二三三·七，德意志民主共和国为一三六，阿尔巴尼亚为七五○。中华人民共和国的工业生产量在一九五二年也已超过了解放前最高水平，而这是与苏联的援助分不开的。例如一九五○年中苏贷款协定规定由苏联在五年之内贷予中国的三亿美元作为中国向苏联订购各种机器设备之用，中国从苏联进口的货物中各种机器设备和工业器材占了绝大部分，而这些机器设备和工业器材的价格平均低于英美市价百分之二十至三十。与大批机器设备和工业器材同时到来的是苏联的慷慨的先进科学技术的援助。大量的苏联专家和技术人员被派遣到中国来。这些专家和技术人员抱着一个崇高的目的，这就是帮助中国人民实现工业化。他们在中国如同在自己的祖国一样，竭力提倡节约资金、外汇和器材，无微不至地发掘工业的潜力。他们使中国的长久废弃无用的机器重新转动起来，把旧式的机器改装为新式的机器，并教导中国的工人们按照苏联的先进工作方法来利用这些机器。为了使中国能够顺利地着手实现第一个五年计划，苏联政府和人民正在给中国以更广泛的经济援助和技术援助，其规模将达到前所未有的程度。
    民主和社会主义阵营各国形成了一个日趋强大繁荣的与资本主义世界市场相对立的新的世界市场。事实已经证明，苏联和人民民主国家的取用不尽的自然资源和不断发展的工业产品足以充分供应彼此日益扩大的经济需要。在一九五二年，苏联对人民民主国家的贸易占全部对外贸易的百分之八○；中国对苏联及其他人民民主国家的贸易占全部对外贸易的百分之七二。一九五二年苏联对人民民主国家的贸易总额比一九五一年增加百分之二二；一九五二年中国对苏联及其他人民民主国家的贸易总额比一九五○年增加百分之一八七·六四。毫无疑问，民主和社会主义阵营各国工业的高速度发展，很快便将证实斯大林的预言：“这些国家不仅不需要从资本主义国家输入商品，而且它们自己还会感到必须把自己生产的多余商品输往他国。”
    随着经济合作的发展，在民主和社会主义阵营各国间进行着日益频繁的文化交流活动。自一九四九年到一九五二年三年间，由中国派赴苏联的代表团共二十二个，由苏联派来中国的代表团共十八个。由中国派赴人民民主国家的代表团共五十七个，由人民民主国家派来的代表团共四十七个。由中国派赴苏联及各人民民主国家的文艺工作团共七个，由各国派来的文艺工作团共十个。在中国举行的介绍苏联的展览会大小四万三千七百余次，观众一亿二千四百三十七万余人；介绍欧洲人民民主国家的展览会共三十七次，观众四百二十四万九千余人。各国书籍的互相传译，各国电影和美术品的互相介绍，已成为人民文化生活中的不可缺少的因素。
    由共同利益和共同理想所联结在一起的民主和社会主义阵营各国人民，在政治上是完全团结一致的。列宁、斯大林和苏联共产党领导下的苏联人民所走的光荣道路是一切人民民主国家的榜样和鼓舞的力量。苏联的慷慨无私的援助是各人民民主国家人民得到胜利和继续前进的不可缺少的条件。和资本主义国家间的关系充满互相的冲突、欺骗、掠夺和侵略完全相反，在社会主义和人民民主各国间和各国人民间存在着的是互相信任、互相尊重和互相援助。伟大的苏联军队在欧亚各人民民主国家人民的解放事业中所作的英勇奋斗，以及以苏联军队为榜样的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜反侵略战争中的英勇奋斗，就是民主和社会主义阵营各国人民间这种充满自我牺牲精神的崇高友谊的纪念碑。民主和社会主义阵营各国人民对于世界政治的根本问题抱有共同的见解，即主张维护持久和平，反对干涉外国内政和新战争的威胁。民主和社会主义阵营各国人民热烈地支持保卫和平的斗争，并且正在以最大的努力来争取朝鲜问题和其他国际争端的和平解决。
    这种完全和谐一致的友好的国际关系，正如马林科夫同志所说，“是国与国之间的一种完全新的关系的范例，这种关系是历史上从来不曾有过的”。这种崇高友谊是胜利了的各国劳动人民国际主义精神的生动的表现。各国劳动人民的利益是互相一致的，胜利了的各国劳动人民的利益与全人类的利益是一致的，因为这样，民主和社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊就是不可战胜的，就是任何力量所不能分离的。当然，只知道奴役和掠夺其他国家人民、只知道准备和进行侵略战争以追求最大限度的资本主义利润的战争贩子们，永远也不会了解这种友谊，就如同他们永远不能破坏这种友谊一样。毛泽东同志在“最伟大的友谊”一文中说：“伟大的中苏两国人民的友谊之所以是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊是根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的。中苏两国人民和各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊，和全世界各国一切爱好和平、民主及
    正义的人民之间的友谊，也正是建立在这样伟大的国际主义原则上，因此，也就是牢不可破的。”让我们把伟大
    的国际主义的旗帜更高地举起来！
    愿伟大的斯大林所创造的民主和社会主义阵营各国人
    民的伟大友谊不断发展，万古常新！
