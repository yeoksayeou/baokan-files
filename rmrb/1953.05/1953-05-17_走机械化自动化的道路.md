Embark on the Road of Mechanization and Automation
By our reporter Lu Hao

The original situation was very serious

Comrade Yan Ming, twenty-seven years old, had only been the director of the "small factory" [Note 1] for a few days when the work seemed to deliberately start acting up and causing him trouble.

That was in April 1952. Normally, four or five hundred 9mm diameter steel bars could be rolled in eight hours, but in recent days, there was one instance where only 173 bars were rolled. At that time, according to the requirements of the national production plan, the small factory was already 2,200 tons of steel short of its quota for the state. In addition, there was no sign of the 5,200 tons that the factory planned to increase. The production plan for 1952 was 35% higher than in 1951. As for how to achieve this, people could only say, "Work hard!" No one could figure out a way.

The fluctuating product quantity wasn't the only problem. At this critical moment, a major casualty accident occurred. The rolling worker [Note 2] An Huimin was crushed to death on the mandrel of the roughing mill.

Problems of this severity were presented to the young factory director one after another. His already thin face became even more sallow. This young man, who had been a platoon leader and company commander in the People's Armed Forces and a district cadre in the countryside, had never changed color when facing life and death situations. But in the face of large-scale industry, he felt complexity and heaviness.

He was anxious and his voice was hoarse, but he couldn't intervene. Others spoke at length, but he didn't understand and didn't dare to say a word. He thought: The higher authorities are calling for increased production and conservation, but our factory is reducing production and people are dying. How can we complete the task?

When the difficulties seemed very serious, Yan Ming repeatedly recalled the Party's instruction to rely on the masses of workers. Once, he casually asked Liu Jia Cai, a technician from a worker background, "What is the key to production in the small factory?"

Based on his more than ten years of experience on the shop floor, Liu Jia Cai unhesitatingly replied: "The rolling section."

Before this, Yan Ming had been the Party Committee Secretary of the small factory. Hearing this, he thought: Yes, in the past, I went to the shop floor, but I just looked around and left. I didn't even know how the machines produced or what problems existed in production. How could this be considered relying on the workers to improve production? So he made up his mind to go to the shop floor more often to see where the problems were occurring in production.

On the shop floor, the fierce flames of the heating furnace seemed to bake the saliva out of people's mouths. The workers in front of the furnace worked at a temperature of 1,200 degrees Celsius. Their eyebrows and hair seemed like they were about to be ignited instantly. The red-hot steel billets came out of the heating furnace, followed the rotating roller table, and headed towards the roughing mill and the finishing mill. The rolling workers had to endure the spraying of the flames and use iron tongs to clamp them and feed them to the machine repeatedly. The glowing steel billets became thinner and thinner and longer and longer as they were rolled. Some were rolled to be ten or twenty *zhang* long. They were like fiery serpents, coming with great force. The rolling workers only had to feed them a little slower or drop them accidentally, and in an instant, the red-hot steel bars would suddenly tower as high as a house. Sometimes, one after another, one after another, they would run and jump wildly all over the ground. If you weren't careful, the burning steel bar would wrap around your body or pierce through the back of your foot. On one side was a red-hot steel world with scorching flames, while behind the rolling workers, the cold wind from the blower and the splashing cooling water from the rollers were blowing. It was truly summer in front and winter in back. Although they changed shifts every ten minutes, as soon as the shift changed, they didn't even have time to wipe the iron filings from their noses, mouths, and faces. They threw down the iron tongs and lay down, regardless of how wet the ground was.

Yan Ming saw the heavy labor brought to the workers by the backward equipment left over from old China, and his heart was in pain. He knew that although the small factory had been continuously adding safety equipment since liberation, and the entire factory had conducted a major inspection of safety work after the recent casualty accident, and although the workers could eat chicken, fish, and meat every day and enjoy first-class health care, it was still difficult to increase production and avoid accidents under such poor equipment conditions. He also thought of the beautiful scenes of automation in the Soviet Union, but he felt that it was too far away from him. He thought that he had only studied for four years and was a "white hat" when it came to industry, and he felt that this burden was too heavy for him to bear.

However, Yan Ming did not retreat. He felt that since the new life had arranged things this way for him, he should move forward.

He couldn't move after taking one step

For about two consecutive months, Yan Ming would always go to the shop floor as soon as he came to work, after arranging the work in the office a little. Sometimes, he simply brought a small wooden stool and worked in the spare parts warehouse near the shop floor. People who wanted him to approve or discuss work always had to find him in front of the rolling mill. Some people couldn't stand this situation, and they sarcastically said, "The factory director has gone to be the shift leader of the rolling team." Yan Ming heard these words and knew what he was doing, so he just smiled and let it go.

When he first arrived at the shop floor, his heart would still beat fast when he saw the long, untamed "fiery serpent." After a long time, he gradually learned the pattern of the steel bar's movement, how it came and how it went, and he was no longer afraid. He learned about the impact of adjusting the mouthpieces and guides [Note 3] on the quality. He even slowly began to know which worker should operate in this way and not in that way. In a short period of time, he gained a lot of knowledge about rolling steel. Some workers praised him face to face, saying, "Factory Director, you're really learning fast." In front of the rolling mill, he often stared intently at the machine's rotation. He didn't go home night after night. When he was tired, he would go back to the office and lie on the sofa for a while. His whole body and mind were drawn to his work.

Once, he was standing in front of the roughing mill when he saw that the red-hot steel billets were sparse and scattered at times and crowded together at others as they headed towards the finishing mill. He asked a worker next to him, "How long does it take for a piece of steel to go from roughing to finishing?" The worker's answer was: I only know how to work, I never count. He thought, how can we work so confusedly? This is a problem!

In order to know the capacity of the machine, he brought a stopwatch to the shop floor the next day to find out how long it took for a piece of steel to go from roughing to finishing. He tested it and it took a total of seventeen seconds. At the same time, he especially discovered that after the finishing mill rolled a piece of steel, the machine always idled for five or six seconds before the steel from the roughing mill could be sent over. He thought: If we could eliminate this gap, the output would definitely increase. He was happy, and the more he looked at the machine, the more energetic he became. The more he looked, the more he couldn't avoid the problems in front of him.

His eyes continued to stare at the roughing mill. He saw that the roughing mill had a total of five passes, and only two pieces of steel passed through at a time. He suddenly thought that if he could roll three pieces at a time, wouldn't this be able to supply the finishing mill? He told a technician about this idea, and the technician replied, "If you say it can be done, it can be done. If you say it can't be done, it can't be done." This made him feel both amused and annoyed. When he discussed it with the young workers, it became even more lively. Some said, "What if someone gets hit?" Some said, "If the ones in front haven't passed, the ones in the back will come up. How can we take care of that?" Some said, "Two or three pieces are just as fast. Stop talking nonsense." He stood on the small iron bridge on the shop floor and stared. Some workers mumbled, "See what new tricks Little Yan Ming is inventing." He wasn't sad when he heard this. He blamed himself for being too impatient, and he thought: The facts will slowly make you believe it.

He found several old workers and held a discussion meeting about this matter. Several of the older workers unanimously supported his proposal.

Yan Ming saw that he was about 70 or 80 percent sure that things would work out, so he let the advanced Jiang Xingjia group take the lead in testing this new operating method. The Jiang Xingjia group tested it for eight hours and proved that it was possible to operate with three pieces of steel at the same time, but the output was still the same. But on the third day of using this method, the output changed. They improved from the advanced record of rolling forty-seven pieces every ten minutes to fifty-two pieces.

This steel rolling record made many workers disbelieve and refuse to accept it. Some rolling workers wanted to compete with the old method and the new method. The strongest worker, Chen Hongchun, even insisted that "Two or three pieces are the same, my method must be faster than his." But in the competition, the old operating method ultimately failed. Chen Hongchun and others worked hard, covered in sweat, and only did forty-five pieces in ten minutes, while the Jiang Xingjia group still maintained the new record of fifty-two pieces. Afterwards, although Chen Hongchun was still stubborn face to face and said, "Not necessarily, maybe you read the watch wrong," he had to admit behind his back, "I can't accept it, but they are just faster."

With the emergence of the new operating method, it used to take seventeen seconds for a piece of steel to go from roughing to finishing, but now it only takes eleven and a half seconds. Because this rolling method was fast, the workers came up with a name for it: "Rapid Steel Rolling Method." The "Rapid Steel Rolling Method" suddenly increased the production capacity of roughing, but large gaps appeared in the production of the processes before and after roughing: the heating furnace couldn't supply enough steel billets for roughing; the finishing mill suffered from indigestion.

In the past, the finishing mill had a large capacity but did little work, and the machines often idled. Now, it had become too late to do anything. The steel bars coming from the roughing mill hadn't even passed through yet, and the next one was already coming up, one after another, continuously. In the past, only two people operated the finishing mill, but now they had added another one, and even the chief foreman had gone up, but it was still difficult to cope.

How can we eliminate the uneven production capacity between the steel rolling processes to achieve the goal of increasing output? How can we combine the improvement of operating methods and the improvement of equipment to more effectively increase production? How can we improve labor protection effectively while increasing output? This became the most pressing problem for the small factory at that time.

Striving for Mechanization and Automation

The problems that were hindering the small factory's progress were problems that the old worker Zhang Mingshan had long wanted to solve.

Zhang Mingshan wanted to install a "reverse guide" [Note 5] on the finishing mill to increase production and replace manual operation. He had been thinking about this for more than two years.

Zhang Mingshan was a worker in the spare parts team [Note 6] of the small factory. Most of the people who worked with him had come from the rolling team. Some had lost toes, some had large burns on their buttocks, and some were young but pale and coughed up blood. Especially on cloudy and rainy days, this one would have leg cramps and that one would complain of back pain. The pain that the backward industrial equipment of old China brought to the workers made him often think: If this continues, how many people will be ruined by the time we get to communist society? He remembered that in the past, the Japanese invaders had experimented with a "reverse guide" in order to plunder more steel from Anshan, but it had failed. He thought that if the "reverse guide" could be successfully tested, the workers would never have to suffer this hardship again.

That was in the winter of 1949. Zhang Mingshan was preparing to join the Communist Party. He thought: Let this be a little something from my heart for joining the Party.

It was this little spark that gradually burned in his heart.

In the beginning, he often went to the scrap heap to look at the broken and incomplete "reverse guide" that the Japanese had left there, looking at its shape, angle, and size. He couldn't even write numbers, so he had to learn and remember at the same time. He took the time to squat in front of the finishing mill, watching how the steel bars moved. He couldn't write, so he remembered it in his heart. When he got home from work, he used a "scissors" [Note 7] to cut out the shape of the reverse guide, then mounted and sewed it. But often this one was too big, that one was too short, and the size was wrong. After ruining one, he would cut another one. He used up all the "scissors" the size of fourteen door panels. At that time, when he was eating, walking, or going to the toilet, he was always thinking about the "reverse guide." He still went to work during the day, and he always worked past midnight at night. When he was tired, he tied a wet towel around his head with a piece of ice. Sometimes he was already lying on the *kang*, but he couldn't sleep, so he would get up again and sit down, holding his head and thinking, thinking until dawn. Sometimes, although he was lying down, his eyes were always looking at the roof, hoping that the night would pass quickly.

One day, it was a hot evening. The whole family had gone to bed early, and he was pasting the "scissors" on the table. The "scissors" was too soft and wouldn't stand up, and he was anxious. The more anxious he became, the hotter it became. He was sweating all over. He suddenly remembered that there was a small ditch not far from the house. He thought: If I use mud to support the "reverse guide" made of "scissors", wouldn't that work? So he quietly took advantage of the faint moonlight and went straight to the ditch along the bumpy road. In the middle of the summer night, he took off his clothes and worked naked, with mud and water. The mosquitoes buzzed and flew over in swarms, and his skin was often scratched until it bled, but he didn't know when it had been broken. It was extremely hot, and the mud and sweat on his body stuck together. He simply lay in the ditch and let the cool water flow over his body. The "reverse guide" by the ditch was finally finished. He used the sun-dried pigskin "steel bar" that he had prepared in advance to test it back and forth in the "reverse guide." It wasn't until dawn that he hurried back home. His wife had already made breakfast. He didn't say a word when he got home, ate some things haphazardly, and rode his bicycle to the factory. He lived in the Xin Di Hao village, in the southwest corner of Anshan, which was at least fifteen *li* from the factory. The road was difficult to travel, and it took an hour to ride a bicycle. When he arrived at the factory, he squatted down and his eyes went black, and his head shook. He still insisted on working as usual.

As soon as he got off work, he hurried back home to look at the "reverse guide" on the ditch. When he looked, ah, the "reverse guide" had been lost sight of by the children playing in the water during the day. The water-soaked "scissors" were trampled in the mud. He was annoyed and anxious, but it was no use. He had to go home and cut more "scissors", then mount and sew. The second "reverse guide" was made, and he continued to test it in the ditch.

He made a new "reverse guide", and the children destroyed it again during the day. It was destroyed and then made again, made and then destroyed again. It happened more than a dozen times. For this, Zhang Mingshan didn't close his eyes for five or six nights. In the end, he had to move the "reverse guide" to a place farther away from home.

Because of the "reverse guide" experiment, he was obsessed with it, and he forgot about sleeping and resting. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to make it work, so he didn't tell anyone at all. But he gradually lost weight, his face became uglier day by day, and he gradually ate less food. Day and night, he couldn't say three words to anyone. The people in the factory couldn't know the truth, and some secretly muttered behind his back, "Zhang Mingshan doesn't know who he's arguing with, he's so upset." Even his wife didn't know what he was doing. Sometimes she saw him not coming home night after night, and then coming back covered in mud, without saying a word. She couldn't help but worry and said, "We already have three or four children. Why don't you say a word to me?"

This kind of life lasted for about two years. Zhang Mingshan felt that the problem of the "reverse guide" had been largely solved. But in his own experiments, the steel bars still couldn't stand up and enter the guide of the "reverse guide" smoothly. He felt that his strength was not enough and he urgently needed help. So he mustered up his courage and went to see Wei Mingrang, the deputy engineer of the small factory at the time.

Zhang Mingshan's "reverse guide" proposal sounded like a joke to Wei Mingrang. First, he had read so many British and American steel rolling books, and he had never heard of such equipment being installed on a finishing mill. Second, Japanese engineers had studied it in the past, and their results were a failure. How could this be possible? Standing in front of him now was an ordinary worker who had only recently learned to write his own name. It was unimaginable that such a person would make such a big proposal. He asked Zhang Mingshan, "Are you confident?"

Zhang Mingshan replied, "I'm a rough guy, how can I be confident?" "If you're not confident, how can you make this proposal?" "Aren't the workers supposed to be the masters? Why can't I make a proposal?"

Because Wei Mingrang couldn't understand how much pain the backward equipment caused the workers, and because he didn't understand what problems were preventing the small factory from continuing to increase production, he couldn't understand the problem Zhang Mingshan was raising. His rule of life seemed to be that if it passed like this today, it should pass like this tomorrow. He coldly replied, "If you're not confident, forget it."

Like a piece of ice covering Zhang Mingshan's heart, he was very angry, but he was still timid about his proposal at the time. He thought, what if the result really couldn't be used, wouldn't it cause trouble for the factory. He returned to the workshop in disappointment. He thought, have two years of hardship been wasted like this? Is the "reverse guide" over from now on?

As soon as he returned to the spare parts team, the scene in the spare parts team grabbed his heart tightly. There was a worker named Chi Zhongxing, who used to be in the rolling team. One of his feet had been shortened by half an inch because of cramps. It was raining that day, and his leg cramped again. He groaned, and some workers were helping him rub his leg. When Zhang Mingshan saw this, he felt as if all the workers were hoping for his "reverse guide" to appear, and his heart became more firm. He said to himself: No matter if no one has been able to do it in the past, a communist will definitely be able to do it.

The "reverse guide" proposal, which was related to the safety of the workers and the production of the entire factory, was blocked by Wei Mingrang's artificial wall.

These things happened before the summer of 1952.

    走机械化自动化的道路
    本报记者　陆灏
    原来的情况是很严重的
    二十七岁的燕鸣同志接受了厂长职务还没有几天，小型厂〔注一〕的工作就好像故意和他捣蛋似的耍开别扭了。
    那是在一九五二年的四月。本来，九公厘直径的钢条，平常八小时能轧四、五百根，而这几天，有一次只轧了一百七十三根。当时按着国家生产计划的要求，小型厂已经亏欠了国家两千二百吨钢材，另外，本厂计划增产的五千二百吨，还根本没有影儿。一九五二年的产量和一九五一年相比，生产计划的要求提高了百分之三十五，至于用什么方法去实现，人们只能说：“拚命干呗。”谁也说不出个门道来。
    产品数量忽高忽低还不算，就在这个紧张的关头，又发生了重大的伤亡事故。压延工人〔注二〕安惠民在毛轧机的棍套上被压死了。
    问题是这样严重地一个接一个地提到了这位年青的厂长的面前，他的本来瘦削的脸孔更加焦黄了。这位在人民的武装部队中当过排长、连长，在农村里当过区干部的小伙子，过去出生入死的时候，脸孔也没有变过颜色，但在大工业的面前，他竟感到这样的复杂和沉重。
    他着急，嗓子也哑了，但插不上手。别人说长说短，自己不懂，一句话也不敢说。他想：上级号召增产节约，我们这里的工厂又减产、又死人，这怎么能完成任务呢？
    在这困难显得很严重的时候，燕鸣一再记起了党说过的要依靠工人群众的指示。有一次，他偶然问起工人出身的技师刘家财：“到底什么地方是小型厂的生产的关键？”
    刘家财根据他十几年在现场的经验，毫不迟疑地回答说：“压延工段呗。”
    在这以前，燕鸣曾经是小型厂的党委会书记。他听了这话，心里想：对呀，过去也下现场，无非是看看就走了，连机器是怎么生产的，生产里面有些什么问题也不大清楚，这怎么能算是依靠工人搞好生产呢？于是他下了决心，要更多地去现场，去看看生产里面到底在什么地方发生了问题。
    现场上，加热炉的烈火，把人们嘴里的吐沫也要烤干似的，炉前的工人在一千二百度的高温下工作，眉毛、头发，真像立刻就要被点着了一样。那火红的钢坯，从加热炉出来，顺着转动的滚道，走向毛轧机、光轧机，压延工人们要忍着火的喷射，双手拿铁钳钳住它，反复地喂送给机器，那红光闪闪的钢坯，越轧越细，越轧越长，有的轧到一、二十丈长。它们像一条火蛇，来势汹汹，压延工人们只要稍许喂送得慢一些，或者是失手落地，一霎眼，通红的钢条一下子就会耸得房子那样高；有时候，一根连一根，一根连一根，满地乱窜乱跳，一不小心，那燃烧着的钢条就会缠住你的身子，或者是穿透你的脚背。这一面是烈焰逼人的通红的钢铁的世界，而压延工人的背后，却吹打着鼓风机送来的冷风和喷溅着的冷却轧辊的凉水，这真是前面过夏，背后过冬。虽然是十分钟就换一次班，但只要
    一换班，鼻子、嘴、脸上的铁末子也来不及擦去，把铁钳一扔，不管地上多么潮湿，往下一躺，就什么也顾不得了。
    燕鸣看到旧中国遗留下来的落后的设备所带给工人们的这样沉重的劳动，他的心是痛苦的。他知道解放以后的小型厂虽然是在不断地增加着安全设备，最近发生了伤亡事故后，全厂还进行了保安工作的大检查。虽然是工人们每天都能吃到鸡、鱼、肉，享受着头等的保健待遇，但在这样恶劣的设备条件下面要提高产量，要不发生事故，这就显得还是一件很困难的事。他也想到苏联自动化的美妙的景像，但他觉得这离自己太远了，想到自己只念过四年书，对于工业是个“白帽子”，更觉得这副担子落在自己的肩上，实在是太重了。
    但是，燕鸣并没有退缩，他觉得新的生活既然已经为自己这样安排好了，自己就应该前进。
    迈了一步就再走不动了
    大约连续有两个月的时间，燕鸣总是一上班，稍许安排一下办公室的工作，就到现场去。有时候，干脆端张小木头凳子在现场近旁的备品仓库办公。人们要请他批准或商量什么工作，总要到轧钢机前才能找见他。有的人看不惯这样的情形，他们嘲笑地说：“厂长到压延班当班长去了。”燕鸣听了这些话，自己心里有底，笑笑了事。
    他初到现场，一看见那长长的不驯服的“火蛇”，心还扑通扑通跳，时间长了，他慢慢知道了钢条走的规律，怎么来，怎么去，他就不怕了。他知道了嘴子、导板〔注三〕的调整对于质量的影响，甚至，他还慢慢开始知道了那个工人应该这样操作，而不应该那样操作。短短的时间，使他得到了轧钢方面的很多知识。有的工人就当面夸奖他说：“厂长，你真学得不坏呵。”在轧钢机前，他常常两只眼睛死死地盯住机器的转动，他一夜一夜的不回家，困了，就回到办公室的沙发上躺一会。他的全部的身心为自己的工作吸引了。
    有一次，他站在毛轧机前，他看见通红的钢坯在走向光轧机的时候，一会儿稀稀拉拉，一会儿拥在
    一起。他问旁边的一个工人：“一根钢，从毛轧到光轧〔注四〕，需要多长时间？”工人的回答是：从来只知道干，没有数。他想这样稀里糊涂的干怎么行？这是个问题呢！
    他为了要知道机器的能力，第二天带了一只秒表到现场来，想知道一根钢从毛轧到光轧，到底是多少时间。他一试验，共费了十七秒钟。在这同时，他特别发现了光轧机轧完一根钢，机器总要空转五、六秒钟后，毛轧的钢才能送过来。他想：要是消灭了这个空隙，产量准能提高。心里一喜，瞅机器就越瞅越有劲，越瞅，他眼前的问题就越躲不过去了。
    他的眼睛继续盯在毛轧机上，他看那毛轧机一共有五个孔，一次来回只过两根钢，他忽的想起如果一次能轧三根，这不就能供上光轧机使用了吗？他把这个意见告诉了一位技术人员，这位技术人员回答他说：“你说能行就能行，你说不行就不行。”这很使他啼笑皆非。他和年青的工人们一商量，就更热闹了。有的说：“碰了人怎么办？”有的说：“前面的没有过去，后面的就上来了，这怎么能顾得上。”有的说：“两根三根一样快，别扯蛋啦。”他站在现场的小铁桥上瞪着眼瞅，有的工人就叨咕说：“看小燕鸣发明什么新花样啦。”他听了也不难过，他埋怨自己太心急了，心里想：事实会慢慢叫你们相信的。
    他找了好几个老工友，为这件事开了一个座谈会，年老的工人中有好几个人一致支持他的提议。
    燕鸣看到事情已经大约有七八成把握了，他就让先进的姜兴家小组带头试验这个新的操作方法。姜兴家小组试验了八小时，证明三根钢同时操作是可能的，但产量还是老样子。但在采用这个方法的第三天，产量就发生了变化，他们从每十分钟轧四十七根的先进纪录提高到五十二根。
    这个轧钢纪录使很多工人都不相信，不服气，有的压延工人愿意用旧方法和新方法比赛比赛。气力最大的工友陈红春还一口咬定说：“两根三根是
    一样的，我的办法一定比他快。”但一比赛，到底是旧的操作方法垮台了。陈红春等拚命干，满身汗水，十分钟只干了四十五根，而姜兴家小组仍旧保持了五十二根的新纪录。事后，陈红春虽然当面还嘴硬说：“不一定，是你们把表看错了吧。”但他背后却不得不承认说：“不服气不行，他们就是快呀。”
    新的操作方法一出现，一根钢，从毛轧到光轧，过去是十七秒，现在只需要十一点五秒了。因为这样的轧钢方法快，工人们给它想了一个名字，叫“快速轧钢法”。 “快速轧钢法”把毛轧的生产能力一下子提高了，但在毛轧前后工序的生产却出现了大漏洞：加热炉的钢坯供不上毛轧的使用；光轧机反害了消化不良的毛病了。
    光轧过去是能力大，干活少，常常有空机器转动，现在是变得来不及干了。由毛轧过来的钢条，这一根还没有过去，那一根就已经上来了，一根接一根，连连不断。过去的光轧机只有两个人操作，现在又增加了一个，连总班长也上去了，仍旧难以招架。
    怎样使轧钢工序之间不发生生产能力高低不平的现象达到提高产量的目的呢？怎样能使改善操作方法和改进设备的工作结合起来更有效地提高生产呢？怎样能在提高产量的同时也使改善劳动保护的工作很有效地进行呢？这就成为小型厂当时一个最最尖锐的问题了。
    为了机械化自动化斗争
    那些障碍着小型厂前进的问题，老工人张明山早就想解决了。
    张明山要想在光轧机上安装个“反围盘”〔注五〕来提高生产，代替人工操作。这件事，他已经捉摸了两年多了。
    张明山是小型厂备品班〔注六〕的一个工人，和他一起工作的人们，他们大多是从压延班下来的，有的断了脚指头，有的屁股上烫过大窟窿，有的人年纪虽轻，但脸色唰白，还吐血。特别一到阴天下雨，这个腿肚子抽筋，那个喊腰痛，旧中国的落后的工业设备带给工人们的痛苦使他常常想：这样下去，到共产主义社会，要坏掉多少人呀。他记起了过去日本侵略者为了要掠夺鞍山更多的钢铁，他们曾经试验过一个“反围盘”，后来是失败了。他想要是能把“反围盘”试验成功，工人们就可以再也不吃这个苦头了。
    那是在一九四九年的冬天，张明山正准备参加共产党。他想：这就算是我参加党的一点心意吧。
    就是这一点星星的火苗，渐渐地在他的心中燃烧起来。
    开始，他常去废铁堆上瞅那个日本人丢在那里的破旧不全的“反围盘”，看它的样子、角度、大小，他连号码也不会写，只好一面学，一面记。抽空就蹲在光轧机的跟前，看钢条走动的情形，他不会写的，就记在心里，下班回家，就比划着用“格巴”〔注七〕剪成围盘的样儿，又裱又缝，但常常是这个大了，那个短了，尺码不对；坏一回，重剪一回，十四扇门板大的“格巴”都给他剪光了。那时，他吃饭、走路、上厕所，什么时候心里都是想这个“反围盘”，白天照样上班，黑夜总要弄到过半夜。困了，在头上用湿手巾绑块冰。有时已经睡在坑上了，睡不着，就再起来坐着，捧着头想，一想想到大天亮；有时虽然人是躺下了，两只眼睛一直望着房顶，盼着黑夜早过去。
    有一天，正是一个炎热的晚上，全家的人都早睡了，他在桌子上粘“格巴”。“格巴”太软，竖不起来，他一个人干着急，越急，就越闷热，全身的汗，淌淌下来，他忽地记起离屋子不远有条小河沟，他想：用泥把“格巴”做的“反围盘”支起来，这不就成了吗？于是，他就悄悄地乘着淡淡的月色，顺着那条坑坑洼洼的小道，直奔河沟而去。在那伏天的夜半，他把衣服一脱，光着身子，连泥带水，干起来了。嗡嗡嗡的蚊子，成群地飞过来，皮肤常被抓得出了血，他也不知道是什么时候咬破的。热极了，身上的泥和汗都黏在一起，他干脆躺在河沟里，让清凉的河水在他的身上流过去。那河沟边的“反围盘”终于弄好了，他把预先准备好的那根晒干的猪皮做的“钢条”，来回在这个“反围盘”里试验。直到天已大亮，他才急急忙忙回到家里，他老婆已经早把早饭都做好了，他回家一句话也不说，胡乱吃些东西，闷头骑上自行车，就往厂里去。他住的新地号村，在鞍山市的西南角，离厂至少有十五里，路不好走，自行车得走一个钟头。到了厂里，他一蹲下去，眼前就发黑，头嗡嗡地直摇幌，他仍旧照样坚持工作。
    一下班，他又急急忙忙回到家里，去看河沟上的“反围盘”，一看，啊呀，“反围盘”已经给孩子们在白天玩水的时候弄得踪迹不见了，被水泡软的“格巴”被踩烂在稀泥里。他恼火，发急，但没有用。只好回家再剪“格巴”，又裱又缝，第二个“反围盘”做成了，他又继续在河沟里试验。
    他做好了新的“反围盘”，孩子们白天又给他破坏了，这样破坏了再做，做了又被破坏，一共闹了十几回，张明山为了这，有五、六个黑夜，眼睛也没有合一合。最后，他只好把“反围盘”挪到离家更远的地方去。
    因为试验“反围盘”，他像着了迷一样，睡觉、休息都丢在脑后头。他怕弄不成，所以根本不告诉谁。但慢慢人瘦下来了，脸孔也一天比一天难看，饭也渐渐吃得少了，白天晚上，跟谁也说不上三句话。厂里的人那里能知道他的底细，有的在背后还暗暗叨咕说：“张明山不知是和谁闹了别扭，这样蹩气。”连他的老婆，也不知道他在干什么，有时候看他一夜一夜不回家，回来又满身是泥，话也不说，她不由得着急地说：“我们已经有三、四个孩子了，你怎么也不给我说一句话呢？”
    这样的日子大约经过了两年的时间，张明山觉得“反围盘”的问题大体上已经解决了。但是在他自己的试验当中，钢条还不能侧立起来顺利地进入围盘的导板，他觉得自己的力量不够用，迫切地需要有人帮助，于是，他鼓了鼓勇气，去见当时小型厂的副工程师魏铭让。
    张明山的“反围盘”建议在魏铭让听来简直是开玩笑。第一，他读过那么多的英、美轧钢书籍，他从来不知道在光轧机上还能安置这样的设备；第二，日本工程师过去研究过，他们的结果是失败了，这怎么会有门。现在站在他面前的是一个普通工人，他能写他自己的名字，也是在最近才学会的，这样的人，提出这样大的建议，那是多么不可想像的事情。他问张明山：“你有把握吗？”
    张明山回答说：“我是个大老粗，我怎么能有把握呢？” “你没有把握，怎么能提这个建议呢？” “工人不是当主人了吗？为什么不能提？”
    由于魏铭让对于落后的设备给予工人们有多么大的痛苦不能有什么体会，由于他不懂得究竟是什么问题使小型厂的生产不能继续提高，所以他对张明山提出的问题是表现得这样不能理解。他的生活的法则似乎是，今天是这样过去的，明天也应该这样过去才对。他冷冷地回答说：“没有把握就算了。”
    像一块冰覆盖在张明山的心上，他虽然很气愤，但他当时对自己的建议还是胆怯的。他想要是结果真的不能使，岂不给厂子添了麻烦。他失望地回到了车间，他想两年的苦头就这样白吃了吗？“反围盘”就从此完了吗？
    他一回到备品班，备品班的情景紧紧地抓住了他的心。有个工友叫迟忠兴，他原来是压延班的，他的一只脚因为抽筋的毛病已经短了半寸。这天天正下雨，他的腿又抽筋了，他的嘴里发出呻吟的声音，有的工人们正在帮他揉腿。张明山一看这样子，他好像觉得所有的工人们都在希望他的“反围盘”出现，他的心更加坚定起来，他自己对自己说：不管过去没有人能做成，共产党员是一定能够做成的。
    关系着工人们的安全和全厂生产的“反围盘”建议，就是这样为魏铭让这道人为的墙壁挡住了。
    这些都是在一九五二年夏天以前发生的事情。
