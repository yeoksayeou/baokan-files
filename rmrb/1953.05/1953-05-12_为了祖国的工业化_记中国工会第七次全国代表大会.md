    For the Industrialization of the Motherland
    —A Record of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    By Our Correspondents Liu Shiping, Chang Gong, Fan Rongkang
    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has concluded. The 813 representatives, representing 10.2 million trade union members, including seven ethnic groups such as Han, Hui, Mongol, Tibetan, Kazakh, Uyghur, and Korean, all expressed their determination at this conference to strive for the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, for the industrialization of the motherland, and for the transition to a socialist society.
    As our country enters the stage of planned economic construction, one cannot help but think of the great history of our motherland and the heroic struggles of the Chinese working class over the past few decades. Our ancestors were diligent and wise. In ancient times, they created happiness and civilization for mankind through their labor. They invented sericulture and silk weaving, movable type printing, and the compass. During those difficult years when imperialism invaded China, the young Chinese working class had already begun its struggle. After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class began to become the leading force of the Chinese revolution. Since then, the Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, after nearly thirty years of heroic struggle, finally won the victory of the revolution on a national scale. When the representatives of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions came from the steelmaking furnaces, from the mine shafts, from the construction sites, from the farms on the Inner Mongolian grasslands, from the sea, railways, and civil aviation lines to the great Beijing, and sat in the solemn and beautiful Huai Ren Hall, when they saw Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the outstanding leader of the Chinese workers' movement, when they saw Liu Dachao, an old seaman who participated in the Hong Kong-Guangzhou General Strike, Ma Zhiyuan, an old Hui worker who participated in the "February 7th" General Strike and is still commemorated every year, and Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions who participated in the work of the Secretariat of the Chinese Labor Union, when they applauded enthusiastically, when they stood up to pay tribute, decades of arduous struggle and the happy life after liberation flooded into people's memories. All the representatives who spoke at the conference stated that they would be worthy of the glorious tradition of the Chinese working class and that they were determined to fight for the completion of the national industrial construction tasks. The representatives from Guangzhou said well, they would not forget how the first, second, and third National Labor Congresses held in Guangzhou educated them to bravely attack imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, they would not forget the great strength of the Chinese working class demonstrated by the victory of the Hong Kong-Guangzhou General Strike, they would not forget the fighting spirit shown by the Guangzhou workers during the Great Revolution, they would not forget the tragic days when Guangzhou workers were thrown into the abyss of suffering by the reactionary rulers during the long years after the Chinese Communist Party moved from the cities to the countryside in the later period of the Great Revolution, they would not forget the glorious tradition of the Guangzhou workers, and would not forget that their responsibility lies in building an industrialized new China to defend and continue to develop their happy life.
    What is the guiding principle for trade union work in the new period of economic construction? Comrade Lai Ruoyu's report clearly pointed out to everyone that it is to strive for the completion of the national industrial construction tasks. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously supported this guiding principle. Because they understand that our country is led by the working class, and the ultimate goal of all measures in this country is to improve the material and cultural life of the working class and all working people. In our new China, the interests of the state and the personal interests of the workers are completely consistent. At this conference, Meyoa Beck, Secretary of the Liaison Committee of Trade Unions of French Equatorial Africa and Cameroon, said: "In Africa, all the wealth on bananas, coffee, cocoa, palm, cotton, timber, etc., and all the wealth underground in gold, diamonds, oil, gasoline, uranium, tin, etc., are mined for the profits of the colonial masters." Chinese workers sympathize with the tragic experiences of Meyoa Beck and the Africans he represents, because Chinese workers have also had similar experiences. But now, Chinese workers can proudly say: "In our country, every new brick laid and every new screw installed is for our own happiness, for the industrialization of our great motherland and the bright future of the transition to socialism."
    Chinese workers dedicate their labor and wisdom to the country, changing the face of our country. China's main products such as pig iron, steel, and steel products exceeded the highest annual output in history in 1952. In the past three years, more than 489,000 rationalization proposals put forward by workers have been adopted and implemented. And the state and the people give the workers the highest honor and happiness. 223,000 workers have been awarded the titles of National Model Workers, Advanced Producers, and Model Workers. In 1952 alone, the state spent more than 1.6 trillion yuan on labor insurance for workers. The red roses and lilacs of Beidaihe bloom for the workers, the sanatoriums on the coast of Qingdao await the workers' arrival, cultural palaces are built for the workers, theater troupes go to factories to perform for the workers, schools open their doors to the workers, girls prepare flowers for the worker uncles, and children offer red scarves to the worker uncles.
    This is our country, a country led by the working class. This is why the representatives attending the meeting unanimously stated that they would constantly improve their class consciousness, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, launch labor competitions, and strive for the completion of the national industrial construction tasks.
    An important issue on this road is to continue to strengthen unity, unite engineering and technical personnel, staff, and workers, unite female workers and male workers, unite apprentices and masters, unite new workers and old workers, unite family members and workers, and unite the ranks of the working class, which have been unprecedentedly expanded and will continue to expand, under the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and to march towards the industrialized new China.
    Many labor models and trade union workers attending this conference are known for their ability to unite, organize, and lead workers to complete and overfulfill production tasks. Their experience has enriched people's understanding of unity. Unity relies on the self-education of the working class, relies on constantly improving the class consciousness of the workers, and relies on the workers' love and mutual assistance.
    Among the delegates to the conference, there was a young girl named Li Shuying, who is an ordinary spinner and the leader of a team in the spinning workshop of the state-owned Qingdao No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. This team used to be disunited. Seven of the seventeen people never spoke to each other face-to-face and muttered behind their backs all day long. When Li Shuying first became the team leader, everyone looked down on her because she was so young.
    Li Shuying took on her work with her own class consciousness. She went deep into the homes of all the workers in the team. She investigated and clarified the reasons for the disunity within the team. She examined her own shortcomings to everyone. She educated everyone with the principle that unity is strength. She guided everyone to carry out criticism and self-criticism. She cultivated the activists of the team. She finally overcame numerous difficulties and improved the unity of the whole team. The bitter enemies who did not speak to each other reconciled, production increased, and the leather roller flowers decreased day by day. This team later became a model team in the entire workshop. In the early stage of promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, this team was the first team in Qingdao to learn the Hao Jianxiu work method, and with its own achievements, it broke the narrow conservative thinking of some old workers and promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method throughout the factory.
    Now, Li Shuying has been promoted to workshop administrator. In our country, 124,000 ordinary workers like Li Shuying have been promoted to engineering and technical personnel and enterprise management personnel. They are continuing to unite, organize, and lead the broad masses of workers to strive for the completion of the national industrial construction tasks.
    The Chinese working class also deeply understands that consolidating the alliance with the peasants and strengthening unity with intellectuals and the people of the whole country are guarantees for winning the victory of the revolution and continuing to develop the victories already won. Comrade Mao Zedong taught them this way, and history and real life also taught them this way. Many representatives who spoke at the conference expressed that they would always maintain and consolidate the close alliance with the peasant brothers. Yin Weichen, an agricultural labor model from Beijing, expressed his gratitude to the leadership and support of the working class on behalf of the peasants in the suburbs of Beijing at the closing ceremony of the conference. As he said: "From our own experience, we deeply feel that the close cooperation between workers and peasants will surely make the construction cause of our motherland a complete success."
    When the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions was held, in the Soviet Union, workers were advancing towards a happy communist society. In the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, workers were striving to complete construction plans named after their beloved Dimitrov, Gottwald, and others. In Korea and Vietnam, workers were supporting the struggle to defend world peace and strive for national independence and freedom with selfless labor. When the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions was held, in the United States, workers were fighting for bread. In the United Kingdom, more than 100,000 Scottish miners protested against the Conservative government's policy of attacking the living standards of the working class. In Japan, millions of workers, regardless of the suppression and obstruction of armed police, held demonstrations in more than 400 places across the country on "May Day." Workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia, Australia, and Africa are striking at the colonialists who are taking the last piece of bread from their mouths. They shouted that they would take the road of struggle of the Chinese working class.
    The working class of the world is uniting around the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Chinese working class is an active participant in the cause of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Chinese working class, together with the working class of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, is strengthening the strength of the international workers' movement with its own construction undertakings. They are showing the greatest sympathy, concern and support for all struggles waged by workers in all capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies to eliminate hunger and poverty. They are defenders of the great cause of peace.
    The trade union representatives of twenty countries were invited to participate in the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, which symbolizes the inseparable relationship between the Chinese workers' movement and the world workers' movement. As pointed out in the resolution of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on supporting the World Federation of Trade Unions to convene the Third World Trade Union Congress: The Chinese Trade Union will strengthen the internationalist education of the Chinese working class, enhance the unity between Chinese workers and workers all over the world, and strive for lasting peace and people's democracy.

    为了祖国的工业化
    ——记中国工会第七次全国代表大会
    本报记者　刘时平、常工、范荣康
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会闭幕了。代表一千零二十万工会会员的，包括汉、回、蒙、藏、哈萨克、维吾尔、朝鲜等七个民族的八百十三位代表，在这次会议上都表示决心为完成第一个五年建设计划，为祖国的工业化和过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    当我国进入有计划经济建设的时候，不能不使人想到我们祖国伟大的历史和几十年来中国工人阶级的英勇斗争。我们的祖先是勤劳和智慧的，在很早的时候，他们就以自己的劳动来缔造人类的幸福和文明，他们发明了养蚕织丝，活版印刷，发明了指南针。在帝国主义侵入中国的那些艰苦的年代里，年青的中国工人阶级早就开始了斗争。一九二一年中国共产党成立后，在中国共产党的领导下，中国工人阶级开始成为中国革命的领导力量。从那时起，中国工人阶级和全国人民在一起，经过了将近三十年的英勇奋斗，终于获得了革命在全国范围的胜利。当中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表们，从炼钢炉旁，从矿山的坑口，从工地上，从内蒙草原的农场上，从海面、铁路和民航线上来到伟大的北京，坐在庄严美丽的怀仁堂里，当他们看到中国工人运动的杰出的领导者刘少奇同志的时候，当他们看见参加过省港大罢工的老海员刘达潮，参加过一直到现在每年都被人们纪念的
    “二七”大罢工的回族老工人马志远，参加过中国劳动组合书记部工作的北京市总工会副主席萧明的时候，当他们热烈鼓掌，当他们起立致敬的时候，几十年来的艰苦斗争，解放后的幸福生活一起涌现在人们的记忆中。所有在大会上发言的代表都表明他们要无愧于中国工人阶级的光荣传统，他们决心为完成国家工业建设的任务而奋斗。来自广州的代表们说得好，他们不会忘记在广州召开的第一次、第二次、第三次全国劳动大会怎样教育他们向帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义进行勇敢冲击的，他们不会忘记省港大罢工的胜利所显示的中国工人阶级的伟大力量，他们不会忘记在大革命时期中广州工人所表现出来的战斗精神，他们不会忘记在大革命后期，中国共产党从城市转入农村后的漫长的岁月中，广州工人被反动统治者投入苦难的深渊中的悲惨的日子，他们不会忘记广州工人的光荣传统，不会忘记自己的责任就在于建设工业化的新中国，来保卫和继续发展他们的幸福生活。
    在新的经济建设的时期，工会工作的方针是什么呢？赖若愚同志的报告给大家明确地指出来，就是要为完成国家工业建设的任务而奋斗。到会的代表一致拥护这个方针。因为他们理解我们的国家是以工人阶级为领导的，这个国家的一切措施的最后目的都是为了提高工人阶级和全体劳动人民的物质生活与文化生活。在我们的新中国，国家利益和工人的个人利益是完全一致的。在这次大会上，法属赤道非洲与喀麦隆工会联络委员会书记梅沃阿·贝克说：“在非洲，一切香蕉、咖啡、可可、棕榈、棉花、木材等地上的财富，一切黄金、钻石、石油、汽油、铀、锡等地下的财富，都是为殖民地的主人的利润而开采的。”中国工人同情梅沃阿·贝克和他所代表的非洲人的悲惨遭遇，因为中国工人也曾有过同样的遭遇。可是现在，中国工人可以这样自豪地说：“在我们的国家里，每一块新砌的砖，每一个新安的螺丝，都是为的我们自己的幸福，都是为的我们伟大祖国的工业化和过渡到社会主义的美好未来。”
    中国工人把自己的劳动和智慧献给国家，改变着我们国家的面貌。中国的生铁、钢、钢材等主要产品，在一九五二年就超过了历史上最高的年产量。三年来，工人们提出的合理化建议有四十八万九千多件被采纳实行。而国家和人民给工人以最高的荣誉和幸福。二十二万三千个工人获得全国劳动模范、先进生产者和模范工作者的称号。仅在一九五二年，国家为工人支出的劳动保险经费就有一万六千余亿元。北戴河的红玫瑰、紫丁香为工人而盛开，青岛的海滨休养所等待工人来临，文化宫为工人而修建，剧团到工厂为工人演出，学校向工人打开大门，姑娘们为工人准备了鲜花，孩子们向工人叔叔们献上红领巾。
    这就是我们的国家，工人阶级领导的国家，这就是为什么到会的代表一致表示要不断地提高阶级觉悟，学习苏联先进经验，开展劳动竞赛，为完成国家工业建设的任务而奋斗的原因。
    摆在这条道路上的一个重要的课题是继续加强团结，把工程技术人员、职员和工人团结在一起，把女工和男工团结在一起，把学徒和师傅团结在一起，把新工人和老工人团结在一起，把家属和工人团结在一起，把已经空前扩大并将继续不断扩大的工人阶级的队伍团结在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说下，团结在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，向工业化的新中国大进军。
    这次到会的许多劳动模范和工会工作者是以善于团结、组织和领导工人们完成和超额完成生产任务而闻名的。他们的经验丰富了人们对团结的认识。团结是依靠工人阶级的自我教育，依靠不断提高工人的阶级觉悟，依靠工人们的友爱和互助。
    在大会的代表中，有一位名叫李书英的年轻姑娘，她是一个普通的细纱工人，国营青岛第一棉纺织厂细纱车间的小组长。这个小组曾经是不团结的，十七个人中有七个人从来对面不说话，成天背后嘀咕。李书英刚去当小组长的时候，大家看她是那样年轻，心里都有些看不起她。
    李书英以自己的阶级觉悟担当着自己的工作，她深入到全组工人的家庭中去，她调查清楚了小组内不团结的原因，她对大家检讨自己的缺点，她用团结就是力量的道理教育大家，她引导大家开展批评和自我批评，她培养了小组的积极分子，她终于克服了重重困难，搞好了全组的团结。对面不说话的死对头和好了，生产提高了，皮辊花一天比一天减少。这个小组后来成为全车间的模范小组。在推广郝建秀工作法的初期，这个小组是青岛市第一个学习郝建秀工作法的小组，他们并以自己的成绩，打破了一些老工人的狭隘的保守思想，带动全厂推广了郝建秀工作法。
    现在，李书英已被提升为车间管理员。在我们的国家里，有十二万四千个像李书英这样的普通工人被提升为工程技术人员和企业管理人员，他们正继续团结、组织和领导广大的工人群众为完成国家工业建设的任务而奋斗。
    中国工人阶级也深深地懂得，巩固和农民的联盟，加强和知识分子和全国人民的团结，是取得革命的胜利和继续发展已得的胜利的保证。毛泽东同志是这样教导他们，历史和现实生活也是这样教育他们。在大会上发言的许多代表，都表示他们要永远保持和巩固与农民弟兄的亲密的联盟。北京市农业劳动模范殷维臣在大会的闭幕典礼上代表北京郊区的农民对工人阶级的领导和支援表示感谢。正如他所说的那样：“我们从亲身的体验中，深刻地感到工人和农民的亲密合作，一定会使我们祖国的建设事业胜利成功。”
    当中国工会第七次全国代表大会召开的时候，在苏联，工人们向着美满的共产主义社会前进，在东欧新民主主义国家里，工人们为完成以自己敬爱的季米特洛夫、哥特瓦尔德等的名字命名的建设计划而奋斗，在朝鲜，在越南，工人们以忘我的劳动支援保卫世界和平和争取祖国独立、自由的斗争。在中国工会第七次全国代表大会召开的时候，在美国，工人们为面包而斗争，在英国，十余万苏格兰矿工对保守党政府向工人阶级生活水准进攻的政策示威抗议，在日本成百万工人不顾武装警察的镇压和阻挠，“五一”劳动节在全国四百多个地方举行了示威，在亚洲、澳洲和非洲的殖民地和半殖民地国家里的工人打击着从他们嘴里夺取最后一块面包的殖民者，他们高喊要走中国工人阶级斗争的道路。
    全世界工人阶级正团结在世界工联的周围。中国工人阶级是世界工联的事业的积极参加者。中国工人阶级和苏联及各人民民主国家的工人阶级在一起，以自己的建设事业来增强国际工人运动的力量，他们以最大的同情关怀和支援着一切资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的工人们为免除饥饿，免除贫困所进行的各种斗争，他们是伟大和平事业的保卫者。
    二十个国家的工会代表应邀参加中国工会第七次全国代表大会，正象征着中国工人运动和世界工人运动不可分离的关系。正如中国工会第七次全国代表大会关于拥护世界工会联合会召开世界工会第三次代表大会的决议里所指出的那样：中国工会将加强对于中国工人阶级的国际主义教育，增进中国工人与全世界工人之间的团结，为争取持久和平和人民民主而奋斗。
