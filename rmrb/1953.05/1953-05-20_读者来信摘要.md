Reader's Letters Summary

    Resolutely Oppose Neglecting Production Safety
    -- Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, many readers have written to this newspaper exposing the situation of certain factories and mines neglecting production safety and causing serious casualties.

    From the letters, it can be seen that there are still some leading cadres who do not adopt a proactive attitude in implementing the policy of safe production in advance, trying to prevent work-related injuries; but only panic and take remedial measures after an accident occurs. The workers say that their approach is: "Closing the door after the thief is gone, putting up an umbrella after the rain." This is indeed a sharp satire. For example, the Hebei Provincial State-owned Hangu Chemical Factory had a total of thirty-six work-related accidents in the first quarter of this year, many of which were caused by the administrative leaders' 麻痹 [má bì - careless/negligent] thinking. A chemical pot in the factory did not have a lid, which was very unsafe during production; the workers had repeatedly suggested installing a lid, but the leadership ignored it. Worker Zhou Xuelin was burned on his foot as a result, with the skin torn and flesh rotten, before the factory leaders paid attention to the problem and the workshop director hurried to find a lid. Another example is the Gaokeng Mine of the Jiangxi Pingxiang Mining Bureau, when carrying out top-caving filling work in the east and west mining areas, it was necessary to go to the top-caved areas to get stones to build piles. This was a very dangerous thing, and the workers repeatedly suggested: use a few long rake poles to rake the stones down to avoid accidents. However, the leaders turned a blind eye and ignored it. As a result, worker Liu Ming's foot was broken by a stone falling from the top before the problem of rake poles was solved. Therefore, the workers said: "These leaders wait until our bodies are injured before they solve the safety problems for us."
    The letters also reflect a more serious situation: some leading cadres are completely indifferent to the safety of workers' lives. They even remain unmoved after work-related accidents occur and do not take this as a lesson to improve the safety of production, resulting in the continuous occurrence of similar accidents. For example, the leading cadres of the Jiangxi Lu (shan) Deng (shan) Highway Engineering Office refused the workers' repeated suggestions on establishing a gunpowder depot, putting gunpowder, a dangerous item, in the workers' sleeping sheds, and did not educate the workers on how to take strict precautions. Therefore, from February 9th to March 22nd this year, within 42 days, there were five gunpowder explosion accidents, killing five workers. However, the leading cadres of the office turned a blind eye to this and still did not adopt the workers' suggestion to set up a gunpowder depot. On April 6th, a fire was caused by a gunpowder explosion, resulting in a tragic incident with nine deaths and eighteen injuries. But this bloody lesson still failed to make these leaders pay attention. On April 10th and 13th, the office had two more serious injury accidents. The main reason for these accidents is that the leaders of the engineering unit treat the workers completely with the attitude of capitalists. They believe that once the project is contracted out (the manuscript did not specify to whom or what unit), they can ignore everything, and they can also ignore accidents.
    Readers' letters unanimously pointed out that to do a good job in labor protection, it is one of the important keys for production leading cadres to establish the idea of the unity of safety and production. Facts have proved that the cause of many accidents is the麻痹 [má bì - careless/negligent] thinking of leading cadres. The approach of the Hangu Chemical Factory and the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, which do not take thorough precautions in advance and only pay attention after the event, is unacceptable; as for the attitude of the leading cadres of the Ludeng Highway Engineering Office, who remain indifferent despite repeated accidents, it is a criminal act and should be sanctioned by law. It is hoped that the leading cadres of all industrial production and basic construction units will take this as a warning, earnestly implement the policy of safe production, and do a good job in labor protection.

    The Fushun Electrician No. 10 Factory Should Correct the Phenomenon of Excessive Overtime Work
    Chen Wenjue, Xu Zhitang, and Chen Qilong of the Fushun City Federation of Trade Unions wrote: The overtime situation in the Fushun Electrician No. 10 Factory is very serious. The factory sometimes allows workers to work overtime without obtaining the consent of the trade union at the same level or without the approval of the city labor bureau. For example, in February, the overtime work time approved by the labor bureau was only 4,072 hours, but the actual overtime work time reached 5,300 hours; in addition, there is also a lot of overtime work under the so-called "workers' voluntary contribution" without overtime pay. The overtime phenomenon in the factory is most serious among the kiln loaders and kiln burners in the third workshop. Kiln burners are fixed to work overtime on public holidays. Workers Hong Wenyi and others worked overtime for 56 work hours each in February: this violates the "monthly overtime work hours should not exceed 48 hours" regulation. The work of the kiln loading team does not have a fixed time and they have to go to work and leave work according to the time required for kiln loading; the factory's poor planning causes workers to stop work and wait for materials, which is not counted as the workers' work time at all. The phenomenon of kiln loading workers coming to work and waiting for one or two hours before starting work is frequent; in March, a kiln loading team waited for materials for as long as seven hours. Kiln loading workers cannot take fixed days off and can only take days off when there are no empty kilns; the factory does not notify them in advance, and workers often only find out "today is a rest day" when they come to work. Some workers live scattered in villages 30 to 40 miles away from the factory, and it takes half a day to travel back and forth.

    The long-term existence of the above situation is detrimental to the health and production of the workers. For example, the third workshop of the factory has a total of 160 employees, and the absenteeism rate has increased month by month this year. There were 97 absences in January, 234 in February, and 50 absenses from only the 1st to the 5th of March. The factory's finished product rate has decreased month by month, from just over 60% in January to just over 55% in February, which is directly related to excessive overtime work.

    The reason for the overtime situation is: the factory's management is poor, the planning is inadequate, and the phenomenon of stopping work and waiting for materials often occurs; the labor organization and allocation are also unreasonable. The administrative leaders of the factory do not conduct research and improvements in management, but they are afraid of not completing the task and let the workers work overtime. This approach is obviously wrong and should be corrected quickly.

    Kailuan Miners Need Large-Sized Rubber Shoes
    Letter from the Kailuan Coal Mine Tangshan Mine Employee Consumer Cooperative: A large number of workers producing underground in Kailuan Coal Mine need rubber shoes, so the supply of rubber shoes is one of the important businesses of our cooperative. The rubber shoes supplied by our cooperative are purchased by the Tangshan City Cooperative Union from the East China District Company of the China Department Store and then allocated. However, because the East China District Department Store stipulates an unreasonable method of selling 100 pairs of large-sized rubber shoes with 35 pairs of small-sized rubber shoes, this has caused great difficulties in our work of supplying rubber shoes. The rubber shoes needed by the miners are almost all large-sized, so our cooperative's large-sized rubber shoes are in short supply and a large number of small-sized rubber shoes are overstocked. We believe that the method of bundled sales adopted by the East China District Department Store is inappropriate because it is not based on the actual needs of consumers; if the company's small-sized rubber shoes are difficult to sell and must be bundled to sell, then the company should earnestly check and improve its own planning business.

    Reader Visits in the First Half of May
    From May 1st to May 15th, this newspaper received a total of 93 visitors. In the work of these two weeks of visits, there is one noteworthy situation, that is, 32 visitors raised opinions on the work of the people's courts in some places; and these opinions relatively centrally reflect the problems in the courts' handling of marriage cases.

    On May 6th, Fan Qishi from Houliutan Village, Yiqu District, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, came to this newspaper and said that the county's people's court does not guarantee freedom of marriage between men and women and does not sanction illegal acts that interfere with freedom of marriage. She said: "My son Fan Wai and Zhao Xiaoran, a woman from this village, have a good relationship and both agree to marry. Zhao Xiaoran's mother also agrees; but Zhao Xiaoran's grandfather Zhao Xue, grandmother Zhao Liu, and uncle Zhao Liu, and three others are not satisfied. In order to prevent them from getting married, Zhao Xue and others severely beat Fan Wai one night in February this year, leaving him with a black and blue nose and swollen face, and bleeding from his eyes. They also threatened my son, saying: 'If you are with girls again, we will send you to court.' At that time, Zhao Yonghui, the militia captain of the village, was also present, and he did not stop this illegal act. When I found out about this, I went to the village chief Song Chuang to reason with him. Song Chuang also ignored me. I wanted him to issue a letter of introduction to go to the county to sue, but he refused. Later, I still went to the county court to sue. The county court summoned Fan Wai and Xiaoran for questioning. At that time, they both expressed their willingness to marry. But the court did not support them. The court said it would go down to investigate, but no one has come yet. I have urged them twice, but it has not been dealt with yet. Because they have not received the government's support, Fan Wai and Xiaoran dare not marry." After listening to Fan Qishi's conversation, we sent a letter to the Gaoyang County People's Court on May 8th, asking them to reply to us with the full details of the matter and their handling opinions; we have not yet received a reply.

    Another major opinion of the visitors regarding the court is that the court cannot insist on enforcing judgments, resulting in the failure to realize the interests of women and children stipulated in certain divorce judgments. For example, Wu Yuru, a woman from Beijing, came to visit and said: "My divorce from Yu Minzhang was agreed upon through mediation by the Beijing Municipal People's Court on October 20, 1952. The agreement stipulates that Yu Minzhang will give me and my child a living allowance of 150 kilograms of millet per month; after more than one year, 100 kilograms per month will be given to the child until the child reaches the age of eighteen. It has been more than six months since our divorce, but Yu Minzhang has never implemented the agreement. I have gone to the Beijing Municipal People's Court many times to request a solution; the court always evades the issue and does not take effective measures to resolve it. This has seriously affected the lives of me and my child."

    Cui Shulian, a woman from Dongyi Village, Shahe Town, Changping County, Hebei, and her husband Gong Zhengang divorced by judgment of the Changping County People's Court in December last year. The judgment stated that the child would be raised by the woman, and in addition to giving the woman farmland and real estate, Gong Zhengang should pay 500,000 yuan for the child's living and education expenses, which should be paid in full by the end of last year's lunar calendar. But until now, Gong Zhengang has only given the woman 100,000 yuan. Cui Shulian told this newspaper: "Now we are living in great difficulty because we cannot afford to send our children to school without money. He dropped out of school last semester. I went to the Changping County People's Court twice to request a solution, but the court did not deal with it. After that, I sent letters twice to urge them, but the court did not reply."

    The basic spirit of the Marriage Law is to abolish the feudal marriage system of arranged and forced marriages, male superiority over female, and disregard for the interests of children, and to implement a new democratic marriage system that guarantees freedom of marriage between men and women, equality of rights, and the legitimate interests of women and children. The love between Fan Wai and Zhao Xiaoran is legal, Zhao Liu, Zhao Xue and Zhao Liu's interference with the freedom of marriage of their children, and Yu Minzhang and Gong Zhengang's abandonment of their children and not being responsible for the living and education expenses of their children are all illegal acts; hitting and scolding people is even more intolerable. In order to correctly implement the Marriage Law and protect the legitimate interests of women and children, it is recommended that the people's courts in the above-mentioned areas should quickly and correctly handle these issues.

    In the past two weeks, some workers and peasants have also come to this newspaper to put forward their suggestions and criticisms on the country's construction undertakings, the work of government agencies, and the work style of cadres. We have forwarded these beneficial suggestions and criticisms to the relevant agencies for research and handling. We will inform you separately after the results are available.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    坚决反对忽视安全生产
    ——读者来信综述
    最近，许多读者给本报来信，揭发某些厂矿忽视安全生产、造成严重伤亡事故的情况。
    从来信中可以看出：现在还有这样一些领导干部，他们事先不采取积极主动的态度贯彻安全生产的方针，设法防止工伤事故；而只是当事故发生后，才慌了手脚，进行补救。工人们说他们这种作法是：“贼走关门，雨过打伞”。这确是一针见血的讽刺。如河北省地方国营汉沽化学厂今年第一季度共发生工伤事故三十六起，其中有不少是该厂行政领导干部的麻痹思想所酿成的。该厂一个化学锅上没有锅盖，生产时很不安全；工人群众早就不断提出安设锅盖的意见，可是领导上却把它当作耳边风。工人周学林因此脚被烫伤，皮开肉烂，该厂领导干部才重视这个问题，车间主任才忙着去弄盖子。又如江西萍乡矿务局高坑矿在东西回采区进行放顶充填工作时，要到放了顶的地方去取石砌垛。这是一件很危险的事，工人们一次又一次地建议：弄几根长的耙杆去扒，免得发生事故。可是领导者却视若无事，不理不睬。结果，工人刘明的脚被顶上塌下来的石头打断了，这才促成耙杆问题的解决。所以工人们说：“这些领导人要等我们的身体受到损伤，才给我们解决安全问题。”
    来信中又反映了一种更为严重的情况：有些领导干部对于工人生命安全完全漠不关心，他们甚至在工伤事故发生后仍然无动于衷，不以此为教训来改进安全生产状况，以致同类事故连续发生。如江西庐（山）登（山）公路工程处领导干部拒绝工人多次提出的关于建立火药库的建议，把火药这种危险品放在工人睡觉的工棚里，又不教育工人如何严加防范。所以从今年二月九日到三月二十二日的四十二天内，就发生了火药爆炸事故五次，炸死了五个工人。可是该处领导干部竟然对此视若无睹，仍然不采纳工人的建议——设立火药仓库。四月六日，又因火药爆炸引起火灾，发生死九人伤十八人的惨痛事件。但这种血的教训仍然未能使这些领导者引起重视。四月十日、十三日两天，该处又发生两次重伤事故。产生这些事故的主要原因，是该工程单位的领导者完全用资本家的态度来对待工人群众。他们认为把工程发包（来稿未说明发包给什么单位和什么人）出去了，一切便不管了，发生了事故也可以不闻不问。
    读者来信一致指出：要作好劳动保护工作，生产领导干部树立安全与生产统一的思想是重要关键之一。事实证明：不少事故的发生原因，是领导干部的思想麻痹。像汉沽化学厂和萍乡矿务局那种事前不周密防范，事后才引起注意的作法是要不得的；至于像庐登公路工程处那种屡次发生事故而领导干部始终无动于衷的态度更是犯罪行为，而应该受到法律制裁的。希望各工业生产和基本建设单位领导干部引以为戒，认真贯彻安全生产的方针，做好劳动保护工作。
    抚顺电工十厂应该纠正加班加点过多的现象
    抚顺市总工会陈文爵、许志棠、陈启龙来信：抚顺电工十厂加班加点情况很严重。厂方有时不取得同级工会同意和不经市劳动局批准，就让工人加班加点。如二月份该厂经劳动局批准的加班加点时间只四千零七十二小时，而实际加班加点时间达五千三百小时；此外所谓“工人自愿献工”的不支加班加点费的加班加点也很多。该厂加班加点的现象以第三车间的装窑工、烧窑工等为最严重。烧窑工在公休日是固定加班，工人洪文义等九人在二月份每人就加班加点五十六工时：这是违反“每月加班加点总数不得超过四十八小时”的规定的。装窑组的工作没有固定时间而要根据装窑的需要时间来上班、下班；厂方计划不周造成工人停工待料的时间，则完全不算为工人的劳动时间。装窑工人来上班后等一、二小时才开始工作的现象是经常的；三月份有一组装窑工竟为了待料而等了七个小时。装窑组工人还不能固定的换休，必须等到没有空窑时才能换休；厂方事先也不通知，工人经常上班来时才知道
    “今天休息”。有的工人散居在距厂三、四十里的村子里，来回就去了半天的时间。
    上述情况的长期存在，对工人健康和生产都很不利。如该厂第三车间共有职工一百六十人，今年缺勤率逐月增加。一月份缺九十七工，二月份增到二百三十四工，三月份仅一日至五日旷工的就有五十工。该厂成品率逐月降低，一月份为百分之六十强，二月份又下降到百分之五十五强，这和加班加点过多也是有直接关系的。
    造成加班加点情况的原因是：该厂经营管理不善，计划不周，经常发生停工待料现象；劳动组织配备也不合理。该厂行政领导干部不在经营管理方面进行研究改进，怕完不成任务就让工人加班加点。这种做法显然是错误的，应该迅速纠正。
    开滦矿工需要大号胶鞋
    开滦煤矿唐山矿职工消费合作社来信：开滦煤矿大量下井生产的工人都需要胶鞋，因此胶鞋的供应是我社重要业务之一。我社供应的胶鞋是由唐山市合作社联合社统一向中国百货公司华东区公司购买后拨来的。但因为华东区百货公司规定了卖大号胶鞋一百双需搭卖小号胶鞋三十五双的不合理办法，这就使我们供应胶鞋的工作发生了很大困难。矿工们所需要的胶鞋几乎全是大号的，因此我社大号胶鞋供不应求，小号胶鞋大量积压。我们认为：华东区百货公司所采取的搭配售货的办法是不妥当的，因为这不是根据消费者实际需要出发的；如果该公司小号胶鞋难于推销而必须搭配才能卖出，那么该公司就应该切实检查，并改进本身的计划业务。
    五月上半月读者来访情况
    五月一日至十五日，本报共接待九十三个来访的人。在这半个月的来访工作中，有一个值得注意的情况，就是有三十二个访者对某些地方人民法院的工作提出了意见；而这些意见又比较集中地反映了法院处理婚姻案件中的问题。
    五月六日，河北高阳县一区后柳滩村范齐氏来本报说，该县人民法院不保障男女婚姻自由，对干涉婚姻自由的违法行为不加制裁。她说：“我的儿子范歪和本村妇女赵小然感情很好，双方都同意结婚。赵小然的母亲也同意；但赵小然的爷爷赵雪、祖母赵刘氏、叔父赵六等三人不满意。赵雪等为了阻挡他们结婚，在今年二月间的一天晚上把范歪狠狠地打了一顿，打得范歪鼻青脸肿，两眼流血。他们还吓唬我儿说：‘你再搞对象，非把你送到法院去不可。’当时本村民兵队长赵永辉也在场，他对这种非法行为并不加制止。我知道了这件事，就去找村长宋创说理。宋创也是不管，我要他给开介绍信到县里去控告，他不给开。后来，我还是到县法院控告了。有一次县法院便把范歪和小然传去审问，当时他俩都表示自愿结婚。但法院并没有支持他们。法院说要下去调查，可总也不见有人来，我去催过两次，到现在还是没有处理。因为得不到政府的支持，范歪和小然就不敢结婚了。”我们听了范齐氏的谈话以后，在五月八日就给高阳县人民法院去了信，请他们将这件事的全部情况和他们的处理意见答复我们；现在还没有接到回信。
    访者对法院的另一个主要意见，是法院不能坚持执行判决，致使某些离婚判决中规定了的妇女和儿童的利益不能实现。如北京市妇女吴玉如来访说：“于敏章和我离婚，是经北京市人民法院于一九五二年十月二十日调解达成协议的。协议规定于敏章每月给我和小孩生活补助费一百五十斤小米；逾一年以后，每月给小孩一百斤，至小孩到十八岁为止。我们自离婚到现在已经六个多月了，但是于敏章始终不执行协议。我多次去北京市人民法院要求解决；法院老是推拖，不采取有效的办法来解决。这就使我和孩子的生活受到了严重的影响。”
    河北昌平县沙河镇东易村妇女崔淑莲和她的丈夫宫振纲离婚，是经昌平县人民法院于去年十二月间判决的。判决小孩由女方抚养，宫振纲除给女方田亩和房产外，应付给小孩生活及教育费五十万元，至去年旧历年底全部付清。但直到现在，宫振纲只给了女方十万元。崔淑莲来本报谈：“现在我们生活很困难，因为没有钱供不起孩子上学，他上学期就失学了。我两次去昌平县人民法院要求解决，法院都不处理。之后，又两次去信催问，法院也不答复。”
    婚姻法的基本精神，是废除包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的封建主义婚姻制度，实行男女婚姻自由、权利平等、保障妇女和子女的合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度。如范歪和赵小然恋爱是合法的，赵六、赵雪和赵刘氏干涉子女的婚姻自由，于敏章、宫振纲遗弃自己的子女，不负责自己的孩子的生活和教育费，都是违法的行为；打人骂人更是不能容许的。为了正确贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女儿童的合法利益，建议上述各该地人民法院应迅速正确处理这些问题。
    在这半月中，也有些工人和农民来本报，提出他们对国家建设事业、政府机关工作及干部作风等方面的建议和批评。我们已把这些有益的建议和批评分别转请有关机关研究处理。待有结果后，当另行函告。
