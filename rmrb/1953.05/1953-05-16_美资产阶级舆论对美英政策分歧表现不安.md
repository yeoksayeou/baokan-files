Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: American bourgeois newspapers and news agencies have expressed unease regarding the surfacing of differences between the United States and Britain on international political issues.
    A United Press International dispatch from London on the 13th stated: “The United States and Britain are today facing the prospect of the most serious divergence in foreign policy since the end of World War II over the issue of holding meetings with the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower’s continued silence for two days regarding Prime Minister Churchill’s proposal for a great power summit, while support for the proposal grows in Britain and Western Europe, has deepened the divide.” This dispatch believes that the “seriousness of the apparent divergence” between the United States and Britain is also due to the fact that “Britain is America’s closest ally.”
    An Associated Press dispatch from San Francisco on the 12th stated that Churchill was “expressing a growing public sentiment in the United States and Europe, especially in Britain,” and that his speech "showed a divergence of opinion between him and President Eisenhower on the principles of how to conduct great power meetings.”
    An Associated Press dispatch from London on the 12th said, “Churchill revealed a divergence in political trends between London and Washington,” and that "Churchill proposed a British foreign policy that is different from Western foreign policy.” The dispatch quoted so-called "diplomats" as saying that Churchill is "trying to look at the world and all the problems of the world through British eyes." The "New York Times" said that Churchill's views on a great power conference "have been seen by some as illustrating a huge divergence in policy between the United States and Britain. Undoubtedly, there are differences of opinion not only between the United States and Britain, but also between the United States and other free countries, in terms of the importance of time, and perhaps even in terms of the conditions for a final peaceful settlement.”

    美资产阶级舆论对美英政策分歧表现不安
    【新华社十五日讯】美国资产阶级的报纸和通讯社对于英美在国际政治问题上的分歧的表面化表现不安。
    合众社十三日发自伦敦的消息说：“在与苏联举行会议问题上，英美之间今日有发生第二次大战结束以来最严重的外交政策分歧之虑。对于邱吉尔首相的举行大国会谈的建议，艾森豪威尔总统接连两天保持沉默，而英国与西欧赞成这个建议的人却越来越多，因而分歧更加深了。”这则消息认为，英美之间的“明显分歧的严重性”还由于“英国是美国最亲密的盟友”。
    美联社十二日从旧金山发出的一则消息中认为邱吉尔是“表达了一种在美国和欧洲、特别是在英国似乎日益增长的公众情绪”，他的演说“表明了在如何进行大国会议的原则问题上他和艾森豪威尔总统的意见有分歧”。
    该社十二日伦敦消息说，“邱吉尔透露了伦敦与华盛顿之间在政治趋势上有所分歧”，“邱吉尔所提出的英国外交政策和西方的外交政策有区别”。消息中引所谓“外交人士”的意见说，邱吉尔“力图以英国的眼光来看世界及整个世界的各种问题”。 “纽约时报”说，邱吉尔的关于大国会议的意见“已被某些人士认为说明了美英两国政策中的巨大分歧。无疑地，不仅美国与英国之间，而且美国与其他自由国家之间在重视时间，甚至可能在最后和平解决的条件方面都存在着分歧的意见”。
