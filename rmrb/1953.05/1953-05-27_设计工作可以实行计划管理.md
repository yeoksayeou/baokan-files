    Design Work Can Implement Planned Management
    Our Correspondent An Gang
    Another aspect of conservative thinking is underestimating the growth of our technical strength. Some heads of sections and projects mechanically determine: "The ability of a technician is equal to half that of an engineer. If an engineer understands a preliminary design in three days, it will take a technician six days." In reality, the design proficiency of technicians and trainee technicians is increasing daily. Under the guidance of advanced Soviet technology, many technicians and trainee technicians have made new creations. A trainee technician in the iron smelting section solved the design problem of a weighing car that engineers had failed to solve. Some sections had done a lot of design work in the past, and everyone had accumulated a lot of experience. When the plan was first drawn up, due to insufficient mobilization of the masses, the value of this experience was not fully estimated. During the second revision of the plan, everyone brainstormed, explored potential, and found tricks, coming up with many ways to shorten design work time. Some sections were newly established, and everyone was unfamiliar with the work, facing more difficulties. The leadership earnestly mobilized everyone to learn and master technology, and quickly broke through the quotas. The design work of the instrumentation section was entirely new work. After the enthusiasm of the masses for learning and working was mobilized, everyone requested to change the quota standards, changing from three workdays per drawing to two and a half workdays per drawing. They said, "In another year, we can achieve one and a half workdays per drawing." The actual abilities of most engineers have improved, but they have more concerns, so they often underestimate their own and others' strengths, looking backward instead of forward. They are afraid of taking responsibility, preferring "less trouble to more trouble." Some individuals still misunderstand the slogan "The national plan is the law," not viewing the completion of the national plan as a collective glorious undertaking, not actively seeking ways to guarantee the completion of the plan, but solely focusing on personal gains and losses….
    Of course, there were other reasons for the failure of the first design plan. For example, some design sections were unclear about the design projects they were responsible for, some did not even know the factory site and products, some of the engineering design principles were not determined, and some job responsibilities were unclear, such as whether technical supervision and design budgets should be included in the work plans of each design section. All of these were difficulties encountered in formulating the plan, and these difficulties were gradually resolved.
    The design department resolutely proposed a second revision of the design plan, criticized conservative thinking, and stated that a conservative design plan would affect the speed of construction, ordering, and national economic construction. It required all staff to use a realistic spirit to find tricks, explore potential, and make design plans according to advanced quotas. The party's political and ideological work effectively cooperated with this work. The administrative leadership specifically grasped the progress of the movement and directly helped various sections solve all the difficulties encountered in formulating the plan.
    The second revision of the design plan more fully mobilized the masses. Design personnel received a good ideological education. People understood in the movement that learning advanced Soviet working methods must be based on advanced thinking. With conservative and backward thinking, it is impossible to formulate a design plan that meets the needs of the people. Everyone criticized conservative thinking, promoted a spirit of active creation, and put forward many valuable suggestions. The iron smelting section mobilized engineering and technical personnel to seriously summarize the existing design experience of blast furnaces No. 8 and No. 7, and formulated specific measures, thus shortening the total man-hours by 33 percent. Some sections overestimated the man-hours because they had difficulty borrowing drawings from the drawing library. Everyone believed during this discussion: "We should improve the management of the drawing library. At the same time, during the period when we cannot borrow drawings, we should actively do other designs and not delay work." Someone suggested attaching importance to design data standard drawings, establishing scientific working methods, unifying and simplifying calculation formulas, etc., which would greatly reduce design time. Just one example is enough: If the designed screws can be uniformly registered using standard methods, changing the current situation where all drawings must depict screws, according to Soviet experts, this one task alone could save at least 500 workdays per year. In the past, collecting original data often took a lot of time because the purpose was not clear. This time, everyone proposed that in the future, it should be collected in a planned manner, without temporary rushing and coping, and the requirements and purpose of the original data should be clear, which can shorten a lot of time.
    During the revision of the plan, everyone earnestly learned from Soviet experts. For many projects that we had not done before, we could not formulate a design plan, so we asked experts to explain them one by one. Some earnestly provided information to the experts and listened to their opinions on formulating the plan. Many sections invited experts and project design leaders to review the revised plan together. In learning, everyone deeply realized that the role of advanced quotas is to give play to and improve our design efficiency and level. All ideas that accommodate backwardness will cause our planned management work to lose its due meaning.
    The result of the second design plan revision basically changed the shortcomings of the first plan, saving a total of 65,019 workdays, which is equivalent to adding 212 production personnel to the national construction cause. Of course, even so, we cannot say that this plan is perfect. It needs to be supplemented and revised in the process of practice. According to experts, this is only a rough plan with some deviations (i.e., not fully tested by practice). However, it has paved the way for the growth of our design strength and the implementation of planned management of design work.
    Resolved Several Issues of Understanding
    The advanced planning methods provided by Soviet experts actually helped us solve the problem of planned management of design work, and also helped us solve some fundamental issues of understanding of planning.
    First, it proves that under the current conditions of lack of experience and manpower, we can completely carry out design work according to plan. Soviet experts proposed feasible methods and quotas according to China's specific conditions, helping our design work embark on the road of planning. Our experience is limited, but by implementing planned management, we can systematically improve the proficiency of staff. In the second month of implementing planned management, some sections of the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Institute broke through the original quotas, indicating that under the conditions of expert assistance and planned production, our design strength is growing rapidly; our manpower is insufficient, so we must use the existing manpower reasonably and balancedly. The handicraft management method can only create an imbalance in the use of manpower, resulting in idleness and very low labor efficiency. Implementing planned management can carefully calculate the workload of each person, thus avoiding the phenomenon of manpower waste.
    Second, it can be seen from the advanced planning methods proposed by experts that "planning is a positive force" and an important means of mobilizing and organizing internal forces and giving play to potential. The plan includes everyone's daily activities and is a command signal for everyone's work and life. Everyone knows their work for the whole year, a month, and every day, can calculate their workload, and plan to improve their labor efficiency. People can see from the plan the close relationship between their work and the entire project and the national construction tasks, thus improving their work consciousness and responsibility. After implementing planned management, the staff of the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Institute deeply realized the serious significance of the slogan "The national plan is the law." On the basis of the plan, mobilizing and organizing the masses to do a good job in design work makes it possible to steadily and rapidly complete the national plan.
    Third, it proves that only by implementing planned management can the handicraft leadership method be changed. In the past, the leadership methods of design departments were mainly meetings and signing documents. Everyone was busy but could not really fully understand the situation below. Implementing planned management can begin to eliminate the lax habits of the entire organization, and the leader can become the general commander of all work, and the entire work department can carry out rhythmic production like an orchestra. Leaders can lead according to the plan, understand the overall work situation through the plan execution report, organize inspections with emphasis during the plan execution process, promote advanced experience, discover problems in time, and constantly revise the plan.
    Fourth, the seven planning forms provided by Soviet experts run through an important spirit, that is, "planning is not isolated and must proceed from the needs of the national economy." In the entire design work plan, the characteristics of design serving construction are particularly evident. The construction date and completion date stipulated by the state are the overall goals of the design staff to complete the work according to the plan. The design plan of each project must carefully consider the convenience of construction. For example, the date when the design department sends out construction drawings is arranged according to the needs of the construction process. They divide the construction drawings into foundation, structure, installation, and non-standard equipment drawings and issue them to the construction site in stages, which can guarantee on-time construction and eliminate the phenomenon of waiting for drawings and idling that often occurred on the construction site in the past.
    Fifth, great attention is paid to the cost accounting of design work. In the past, we generally did not consider the cost of design work. Some designs also proposed how many drawings need to be made and how much manpower is needed, but these were "rough estimates" and "approximate figures" obtained by "rough estimation". There is no connection between manpower and the number of drawings. Anyway, "the more people needed, the better", and there is no precise estimate. The Soviet experts' plan for design is based on repeated and careful calculations. They use calculation as the basis for formulating the plan. They estimate the man-hours according to the simplicity and complexity of various drawings in the three stages of preliminary design, technical design, and construction drawings, instead of calculating the total number of drawings required in a stage in general, but measuring the complexity of the drawings and the manpower required one by one according to the needs of the project, and then obtain accurate man-hour estimates. The manpower used for each drawing calculated so accurately is economical and reasonable, thus greatly reducing the design cost and improving production efficiency, and can free up more strength to be used in the design work that the national construction needs most urgently.
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Design Department has had a good start in accepting advanced Soviet planning management methods. But this is only the beginning, and many problems need to be further resolved. Such as the problem of speeding up the design work, the relationship between the main design section and the cooperating section, the problem of comprehensively adhering to and improving the planned management work, and the problem of improving the design quality and organizing regular competitions on the existing basis. We believe that as long as we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and earnestly learn from Soviet experts, the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Department will gradually solve the main problems in the work, further improve the design quality, and speed up the design progress.

    设计工作可以实行计划管理
    本报记者  安岗
    保守思想的另一面是对于我们技术力量的生长估计不足。有些科和工程负责人机械地认定：“技术员能力等于工程师的一半，工程师了解初步设计用三天，技术员就得用六天。”实际上技术员，见习技术员的设计熟练程度是日益提高了的。在苏联先进技术的指导下，很多技术员见习技术员都有着新的创造，炼铁科一个见习技术员就解决了工程师所未能解决的秤量车的设计问题。有的科过去做了不少的设计，大家都有了不少的经验，第一次订计划时，由于发动群众不充分，因而没有充分估计到这些经验的可贵。第二次修订计划时，大家动脑筋挖潜力找窍门想出了很多办法，缩短了设计工作时间。有的科是新建立起来的，大家对工作不熟悉，困难较多，领导上认真发动大家学习和掌握技术，很快地也突破了定额。计器科的设计工作是完全新的工作，群众学习和工作的热情发动起来后，大家要求改变定额标准，把三工日一张图纸改成了二点五工日
    一张图纸。他们说：“再过一年，我们可以实现一个半工日一张图纸。”大部分工程师实际能力都是提高了的，但他们顾虑较多，因此常常容易低估自己的和别人的力量，眼睛向后看，不能向前看。他们害怕负责任，“多一事不如少一事”，个别人对“国家计划就是法律”这个口号还有误解，不把完成国家计划看作是集体的光荣的事业，不是积极设法保证完成计划，而是单纯从个人利害得失上着眼……。
    当然，第一次订设计计划的失败还有其他各种原因，譬如有些设计科对自己所担任的设计项目不明确，有的连厂址和产品都不知道，有些工程的设计原则没有确定，有些工作职责不清，如技术监工，设计预算是否要列入各设计科工作计划之内也不明确。这一切都是订计划中所遇到的困难，这些困难逐步都得到了解决。
    设计处坚决提出第二次修订设计计划，批判了保守思想，说明保守的设计计划将会影响施工，订货和国家经济建设的速度，要求全体工作人员用实事求是的精神找窍门挖潜力，按照先进的定额来作设计计划。党的政治思想工作有力地配合了这个工作。行政领导上具体掌握运动的进度，直接帮助各科解决订计划中所遇到的一切困难。
    第二次修订设计计划时比较充分地发动了群众。设计人员受到了一次很好的思想教育。人们在运动中懂得了学习苏联的先进的工作方法必须以先进的思想为基础。用保守落后的思想是不会也不能订出符合人民需要的设计计划的。大家批判了保守思想，发扬了积极创造精神，提出了许多非常宝贵的建议，炼铁科发动工程技术人员认真总结了第八号第七号高炉已有的设计经验，订出了具体措施，因而把整个工时缩短了百分之三十三。有些科因向图库借图纸有困难便多估了工，大家这次讨论时认为：“我们应当改进图库管理，同时，在借不到图纸的期间，我们应当主动地作其他设计，不要耽误工作。”有人提出重视设计资料标准图，建立科学的工作方法，统一和简化计算公式等，这些都会大大减省设计时间，这里只举一个例子就够了：如果能够把设计的螺丝钉采用标准方法统一登记，改变现在绘图都要画上螺丝钉的情况，据苏联专家估计，光这一项工作，每年就可以至少节省五百个工。过去搜集原始资料因为目的性不明确常常要花费很多的时间，这次大家提出，以后要有计划地搜集，不要临时忙乱应付，对原始资料的要求和目的要明确，这就可以缩短很多时间。
    在修订计划中，大家认真向苏联专家学习，许多过去没有做过的工程，我们无法订设计计划，便请专家一件一件地进行讲解。有的认真地向专家提供情况，听听专家关于订计划的意见。不少的科邀请专家同工程设计负责人会审修订后的计划。在学习中，大家亲切地体会到先进定额的作用乃是为了发挥和提高我们的设计效率和水平。一切迁就落后的思想都会使我们的计划管理工作丧失应有的意义。
    第二次设计计划修订的结果，基本上改变了第一次计划的缺点，共省了六万五千零十九个工，等于为国家建设事业增加了二百一十二个生产人员。当然，即便如此，我们也不能说，这个计划就是十全十美的了。它需要在实践过程中进行补充和修正。按照专家意见，这只是一个大体的带有某种偏差的（即未经实践充分考验了的）计划。但，它为我们设计力量的生长和实行设计工作的计划管理铺平了道路。
    解决了几个认识上的问题
    苏联专家提供的订计划的先进方法，实际上帮助我们解决了设计工作的计划管理问题，同时还为我们解决了对计划的一些根本认识问题。
    第一，它证明了在现在缺少经验和人力的条件下，我们是完全可以按计划来作设计工作的。苏联专家按照中国具体条件提出了可行的办法和定额，帮助我们的设计工作走上计划的道路。我们的经验是少
    的，可是，实行计划管理，就可以有系统地提高工作人员熟练程度。鞍钢设计处在实行计划管理的第二个月，有的科就突破了原有定额，说明在专家帮助和计划生产的条件下，我们的设计力量是生长得快的；我们人力是不充分的，因此我们就更必须合理地平衡地使用现有人力。手工业的管理方法只能造成人力使用的不平衡，窝工和非常低的劳动效率。实行计划管理就可以对每个人的工作量都精打细算，因而避免了人力浪费现象。
    第二，从专家提出的先进的订计划的方法中可以看到：“计划是积极的力量”，是动员组织内部力量，发挥潜力的一个重要手段。计划包括了每一个人的日常活动，是每一个人的工作和生活的指挥信号。人人都知道自己全年、一个月和每天的工作，都可以计算自己的工作量，有计划地提高自己的劳动效率。人们从计划中可以看到自己的工作同整个工程、同国家建设任务的密切关系，因而可以提高工作的自觉性和负责精神。鞍钢设计处实行计划管理后，工作人员都深切地体验到“国家计划就是法律”这个口号的严重意义。在计划的基础上，动员组织群众作好设计工作，就有可能稳步而又加速地完成国家计划。
    第三，是证明了只有实行计划管理才可以改变手工业的领导方法。过去设计部门的领导方法主要是开会和签署文件。大家忙作一团却无法真正全面地了解下情，实行计划管理就可以开始消除整个组织机构的散漫习气，领导者才有可能成为全部工作的总指挥，整个工作部门才能像一个乐队似的进行有节奏的生产。领导者可以依据计划进行领导，通过计划执行的表报来了解全面工作情况，在执行计划的过程中可以有重点地组织检查，推广先进经验，及时发现问题，不断地修正计划。
    第四，苏联专家提供的七种计划表格贯串了一个重要的精神，这就是“计划不是孤立的，必须从国民经济需要出发”。在全部设计工作计划中，特别明显地表现了设计为施工服务的特点。国家规定的施工日期和竣工日期是设计工作人员按计划完成工作的总奋斗目标。每个工程设计计划都必须周密地估计到施工的便利，如设计部门发出施工图的日期都是按照施工进程的需要来安排的，他们把施工图分成基础、结构、安装、非标准设备等类图纸分期发给工地，这就可以保证按时施工并消除过去工地时常发生的窝工待图的现象。
    第五，是十分注意设计工作的成本核算。我们过去作设计工作一般是不计成本的，有些设计也曾提出需要制多少张图纸和用多少人工，但这些都是用“粗估”、“毛估”的方法得来的“概数”。人工同图纸的张数是没有联系的，反正是“人要得越多越好”，而没有一个精确的估计。苏联专家订设计计划则是根据反复的、仔细的计算，他们把计算作为制订计划的基础。他们按照初步设计、技术设计、施工图三个阶段各种图纸的简单和复杂的程度来估工，不是笼统地算一个阶段所需要的图纸总数，而是按照工程需要，一张一张地衡量图纸的复杂性及其所需要的人工，然后得出精确的估工数字。这样精确计算出来的每张图纸所用的人力都是经济的、合理的，因而，大大降低了设计成本，提高了生产效率，可以腾出更多的力量用到国家建设中最迫切需要的设计工作中去。
    鞍钢设计部门接受苏联先进的计划管理方法，已有了良好开端。但这仅仅是开始，许多问题都有待于进一步的解决。如加快设计工作速度问题，设计的主体科同配合科的关系问题，全面地坚持和提高计划管理工作的问题以及在现有基础上提高设计质量组织经常性的竞赛问题。我们相信，只要充分发动群众积极性，认真向苏联专家学习，鞍钢设计部门一定会逐步解决工作中的主要问题，进一步提高设计质量，加快设计进度。        （续完）
