Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 13th – In April, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army achieved new victories in the battles for mountain positions. Throughout the month, our forces engaged in 201 operations, eliminating over 14,400 enemy troops, including over 4,800 American soldiers.

Two larger-scale battles for positions occurred this month: one near the unnamed heights northwest of Bianyandong, near Wendengli in the east; the other on North Mountain, northwest of Shixian Cave, near Lianchuan in the central sector.

The battle for the unnamed heights near Bianyandong lasted sixteen days, during which our forces eliminated over 2,000 soldiers of the Rhee’s Third Division. On the night of April 1st, a counter-attacking unit of our forces captured the enemy's fortified position with its strong fortifications and tunnels in a fifteen-minute battle. From the 2nd to the 4th, the enemy launched small-unit counterattacks against our forces, but they were all repelled. From the 5th to the 9th, the enemy launched desperate attacks for days, using forces of up to two battalions, approximately 1,000 soldiers, but ultimately failed under the strong blows of our forces. In the week after the 9th, fearing the bombardment of our forces' intense artillery fire, the enemy switched to night attacks and ambushes, but all attacks and ambushes were still repelled by our forces.

The battle for North Mountain in Shixian Cave began on the night of the 16th. After capturing the position, our counter-attacking unit engaged in repeated battles with the enemy. The enemy briefly retook the main peak but was then driven back by our forces. By dawn on the 19th, our forces had repelled more than 30 counterattacks, ranging in size from platoons to battalions. Finally, after completing the mission of annihilating the enemy, our forces returned to their own positions under orders. Our forces eliminated nearly 1,000 soldiers of the American Seventh Division in this battle.

In addition to the above two larger-scale battles, our forces also conducted 46 successful raids in April, eliminating most of two enemy companies, two complete platoons, six squads, and most of another four platoons. Among the enemy eliminated were American and Rhee’s troops, as well as British and Belgian forces. The enemy launched more than 40 attacks against our forces in April. All were repelled by our forces.

The above battle situation shows that our positions are becoming more consolidated with each battle, our fighting power is becoming stronger with each battle, and the situation on the front line is increasingly developing in our favor. No matter how strong the enemy's fortifications are, our forces can capture them if we want to; no matter how frantic the enemy's counterattacks, our forces can hold them if we want to. And any military offensive by the enemy can only have one result: failure and suffering more casualties.

Since the negotiations for the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war began in Panmunjom on April 6, enemy aircraft activity has increased compared to the past. According to statistics, enemy aircraft intruded into the airspace over northern Korea approximately 33,400 sorties in April, indiscriminately bombing peaceful towns and villages, more than 3,000 sorties more than last month. However, the American aerial bandits also suffered greater punishment. Under the powerful blows of our heroic People's Volunteer Air Force units and anti-aircraft artillery units, 322 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged in April.

Our front-line mobile artillery and infantry snipers also achieved great victories this month. Snipers from all units on the entire front killed or wounded a total of 3,340 enemy soldiers; mobile artillery fire killed or wounded a total of 4,506 enemy soldiers. The sum of these two figures accounts for more than 54% of the total number of enemy troops eliminated by our forces in April. This shows that the operations of our mobile artillery and snipers are of great significance in depleting the enemy's strength. The battle achievements of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in April are as follows (incomplete statistics):

1.  A total of 14,462 enemy troops were eliminated. This includes 4,894 American soldiers, 761 British soldiers, 35 Belgian soldiers, and 8,772 soldiers of the Rhee’s army.

2.  Seized: one 81mm mortar, three recoilless guns, one 90mm rocket launcher, five flamethrowers, seventeen heavy machine guns, thirty-seven light machine guns, four hundred and eleven automatic rifles and other automatic firearms, seven rifles and pistols, and various military communication equipment such as radios and walkie-talkies.

3.  Shot down 104 enemy aircraft, damaged 218 enemy aircraft; destroyed or damaged 41 enemy tanks; destroyed or damaged 106 enemy vehicles; destroyed 43 enemy artillery pieces of various types.

    朝中部队四月份歼敌一万四千名
    共击落击伤敌军飞机三百二十二架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】在四月份，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在争夺山岭阵地的战斗中取得了新的胜利。全月我军共作战二百零一次，歼灭敌军一万四千四百多名，其中美军占四千八百多名。
    这个月有两次较大规模的争夺战：一次发生在东线文登里西北边岩洞附近的无名高地上；另一次发生在中线涟川西北石岘洞北山。
    边岩洞附近无名高地的争夺战进行了十六天，我军共歼灭李伪军第三师两千多人。四月一日夜间，我军一支反击部队在十五分钟战斗中即将这个筑有坚固工事和坑道的敌军阵地攻占。二日到四日，敌人以小部队向我军反扑，都被击退。五日到九日，敌人连日拚命猛攻，使用兵力达两个营约一千多人，但结果仍在我军的强大打击下遭受失败。九日以后的一周间，敌人惧怕我军猛烈炮火的轰击而改在夜间进行攻击和偷袭，但是所有攻击和偷袭仍然都被我军击退。
    石岘洞北山的战斗从十六日夜间开始。我军反击部队在攻占这个阵地后即与敌人展开反复争夺战。敌人曾一度重占主峰，但又被我军夺回。激战到十九日天明之前，我军共击退敌人由排到营的大小反扑三十多次。最后，我军在完成歼敌任务后奉命回到自己的阵地上。我军在这次战斗中共歼灭美军第七师近一千人。
    除以上两次较大规模的战斗外，我军还在四月份中进行了四十六次胜利的袭击战，共歼灭了敌军两个连的大部两个整排六个班，及另四个排的大部。被歼灭的敌人中除美军和李伪军之外，还有英国和比利时的部队。敌人在四月份中向我军进行了四十多次袭击。全都被我军击退。
    上述战况表明：我军阵地愈战愈巩固，我军战斗力愈战愈强，战线形势正日益向对我有利方面发展。不管敌人阵地上的工事如何坚固，我军要攻就能攻下来；不管敌人举行怎样疯狂的反扑，我军要守就能守得住。而敌人的任何军事进攻只能有一个结果，就是：失败和遭受更多的伤亡。
    自四月六日板门店开始交换病伤战俘的谈判以后，敌机的活动比过去增多了。据统计，四月份侵入朝鲜北部上空滥炸朝鲜和平城乡居民的敌机共约三万三千四百多架次，比上个月多三千多架次。但是，美国空中强盗们也遭到了更大的惩罚。在我英勇的人民志愿军空军部队和高射炮部队的有力打击下，敌机在四月份被击落击伤三百二十二架。
    前线我军的游动炮兵和步兵狙击手在这个月中，也取得了很大胜利。全线各部队狙击手共打死打伤敌军三千三百四十名；游动炮火共打死打伤敌军四千五百零六名。把这两种毙伤敌军的数目加在一起，约占四月份我军歼敌总数的百分之五十四以上。这说明我军游动炮兵和狙击手的作战在消耗敌人力量上是具有重要意义的。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军四月份战绩如下（不完全统计）：
    一、共计歼灭敌军一万四千四百六十二名。其中包括：美军四千八百九十四名，英军七百六十一名，比利时军三十五名，李伪军八千七百七十二名。
    二、缴获：八一迫击炮一门，无后座力炮三门，九零火箭筒一具，火焰喷射器五具，重机枪十七挺，轻机枪三十七挺，自动步枪等自动火器四百十一枝，步枪、短枪七枝，及电台、步行机等各种军用通话器材一部。
    三、击落敌机一百零四架，击伤敌机二百一十八架；击毁击伤敌军坦克四十一辆；击毁击伤敌汽车一百零六辆，击毁敌各种大炮四十三门。
