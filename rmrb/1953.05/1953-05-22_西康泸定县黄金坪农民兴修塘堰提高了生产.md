Reader's Letters Summary

    Letter from the First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Luding County, Xikang Province, Tan Zizhen: During the drought prevention and resistance movement in April 1952, farmers in Huangjinping, Luding County, Xikang Province, began to build ponds and dams under the leadership of the district and township governments. However, at that time, due to poor planning and excessive labor, the farmers had complaints, and the dam construction project was halted midway. In June, the area suffered a drought, and corn production decreased by 50%. The villagers regretted it and requested to continue the dam construction. The village cadres immediately seized this opportunity and organized the masses to build the dam. The Xikang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau learned about this and also sent cadres to assist. Soon, the dam was completed, and the farmers in Huangjinping immediately benefited greatly. Originally, 31 households in the village had dry land. Last year, during the planting of the small spring crops in September, 27 households turned their dry land into paddy fields. The farmers cherished their dams and established a dam management office to regularly inspect the dams. If any damage was found, they immediately mobilized the masses to repair them. This year's wheat seedlings in the village are also very different from last year's. Each stalk generally has more than 20 ears, and some have as many as 40. While wheat in other villages is only a foot tall, the wheat in Huangjinping is more than two feet tall. It is currently estimated that the entire village will increase wheat production by 4,000 pi (each pi is 7 jin) this year, and the farmers are all beaming with joy.

    西康泸定县黄金坪农民兴修塘堰提高了生产
    中共西康省泸定县第一区区委会谭子珍来信：一九五二年四月防旱抗旱运动中，西康泸定县黄金坪的农民在区乡政府领导下曾开始兴修塘堰，但当时因计划不周，用工太多，农民们有意见，修堰工程就中途停顿了。六月，当地遭受旱灾，玉麦减产百分之五十。老乡很后悔，纷纷要求继续动工修塘堰。村干部马上抓紧这个时机，组织群众起来修堰。西康省水利局知道了这件事，也派干部来协助。不久，堰修成了，黄金坪的农民立刻得到很大好处。该村原有三十一户农民有旱地，去年九月小春下种时就有二十七户农民把旱地变为水地。农民们很爱护自己的水堰，成立个水堰管理所，经常检查水堰，发现损坏的地方，就立即动员群众修补。该村今年的麦苗也和去年大不一样，每根普遍发二十几枚，多的有四十枚。别的村麦子还只长到一尺多高，黄金坪的麦子就有二尺多高了。目前估计，全村今年能增产麦子四千批（每批七市斤），农民们都乐得喜眉笑脸的。
