Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th: According to TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" recently published an article by Ilya Prischevsky commenting on the national liberation struggles of the working people in colonies and dependent countries. The article stated: The national liberation movement in colonies and dependent countries is a major factor weakening the forces of imperialism. The victory of the Chinese people has had a revolutionary impact on the further development of the liberation struggles of the dependent peoples.

Colonial and semi-colonial countries have commonalities: they are all subjected to the oppression of imperialism and feudal remnants. Therefore, it is no accident that all colonial countries must simultaneously fight against imperialism and feudal remnants and fight for economic development and improved living standards. This is the essence of the national liberation movement. This is an inevitable historical process and a law of historical development.

In the struggle of colonial peoples against imperialism and feudalism for national liberation, the working class has taken on the leadership role, which is also a law of historical development. Because no other force can lead the national liberation movement in the colonies and lead it to victory. The interests of the working class are consistent with the interests of the majority of the nation.

The victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle convincingly proves that the scale and strength of the national liberation movement depends on the degree to which the broad masses participate in the movement. This primarily means that peasants, and all working people must be drawn into the struggle; it also means that the national bourgeoisie must also be drawn into the liberation movement. It is precisely because of this that the Communist Party and the Workers' Party attach great importance to forming and consolidating an anti-imperialist united front for the struggle for national independence in colonial countries, with the participation of the broad masses and led by the working class.

The people of colonies and dependent countries have different forms of struggle in different countries because each country has its specific conditions.

After listing the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America for national liberation and national independence, the article pointed out: The colonial people are no longer docile slaves. The national liberation struggle in colonies and semi-colonies is becoming more powerful and more organized. It is forming a mass struggle. The colonial people are resolutely moving towards the goal of freedom and independence.

    “真理报”发表普利歇夫斯基的专文指出
    殖民地和附属国民族解放运动正日益壮大
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”最近发表伊利·普利歇夫斯基所写的文章，评论殖民地与附属国劳动人民的民族解放斗争。文章说：殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动是削弱帝国主义力量的一个重大因素。中国人民的胜利对附属国人民解放斗争的进一步发展起了革命化的影响。
    殖民地和半殖民地国家有着共同之点：它们都受着帝国主义和封建残余的压迫。因此，所有的殖民地国家都要同时对帝国主义与封建残余作斗争，为发展经济与提高生活水平而斗争，这并不是偶然的事。这是民族解放运动的本质。这是一种不可避免的历史过程和历史发展的法则。
    在殖民地人民向帝国主义与封建主义进行争取民族解放的斗争中，工人阶级担负起了领导权，这也是历史发展的法则。因为没有其他任何力量能够在殖民地领导民族解放运动并使它走向胜利。工人阶级的利益与全民族大多数人的利益是一致的。
    中国人民解放斗争的胜利令人确信地证明：民族解放运动的规模与力量决定于广大群众参加到运动中去的程度。这首先意味着必须把农民和全体劳动人民吸引到斗争中来；这也意味着要把民族资产阶级吸引到解放运动中来。正是因为这样，共产党与工人党非常重视在殖民地国家中组成与巩固争取民族独立斗争的反帝统一战线，这个反帝统一战线有广大群众参加，而由工人阶级领导。
    殖民地与附属国的人民在各个不同国家中有不同的斗争形式，因为每一个国家有它特定的具体条件。
    文章在列举亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族解放和民族独立的斗争后指出：殖民地人民不再是驯顺的奴隶了。殖民地与半殖民地的民族解放斗争是越来越强大，越来越有组织了。它正在形成为群众性的斗争。殖民地的人民坚决地向着自由与独立的目标前进。
