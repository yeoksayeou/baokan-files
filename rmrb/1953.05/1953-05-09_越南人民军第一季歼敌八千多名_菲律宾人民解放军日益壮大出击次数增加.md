In the above battles, the People's Army forces annihilated more than 5,400 enemy soldiers, extending the guerrilla area southwest of Vinh Phuc Province to the Red River, connecting the Quynh Coi area and the Tien Hung-Duyen Ha-Hung Nhan and Phu Yi-Vinh Bao guerrilla bases in Thai Binh Province into one, and expanding the Phu Cu guerrilla base in Hung Yen Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Manila, May 8th: The continuous development of the Philippine People's Liberation Army has caused panic in the reactionary Philippine government. Due to the increased number of attacks by the Philippine People's Liberation Army, the Quirino government recently declared a curfew from nightfall to dawn in eight towns in Rizal Province, east of Manila. At the same time, Quirino's puppet army chief of staff, Duque, also wrote to the U.S. Embassy, warning Americans not to travel on the highways at night.

Quirino's puppet military authorities revealed that the Philippine People's Liberation Army ambushed two motorized patrol teams of Quirino's puppet army in Banay and Nauban in Laguna Province and Quezon Province on the night of the 5th. According to the puppet military authorities, the Liberation Army killed and wounded five puppet soldiers.
