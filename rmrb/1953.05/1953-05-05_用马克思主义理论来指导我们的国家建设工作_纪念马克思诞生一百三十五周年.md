    Use Marxist Theory to Guide Our National Construction Work
    ——Commemorating the 135th Anniversary of Marx's Birth
    "Theory becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses." - This is a famous saying of Marx in his early work "Introduction to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right."
    Marx's famous saying is a great truth, which is increasingly proven by irrefutable historical facts.
    On this day, the 135th anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx, the founder of scientific communism, the genius thinker, and the great leader and teacher of the world proletariat, Marxist theory is gripping an increasingly large number of people and becoming an increasingly powerful material force. The scientific predictions of Marx and his close comrade-in-arms Engels about the elimination of the system of exploitation and the construction of a communist society have become a reality in the Soviet Union. Today, one-third of the world's population has been freed from the shackles of imperialism and has established a powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism led by the Soviet Union, continuing to realize the scientific predictions of Marx and Engels; they are building the motherland of the people and the beautiful life of the people, and are inspiring the working people of the world to fight for a common and beautiful life.
    Marxism can grasp such broad masses and generate such great power precisely because it is correct. Lenin said in "The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism": "The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is complete and harmonious, and provides men with a consistent view of the universe, which cannot be reconciled with any superstition, any reaction, any defense of bourgeois oppression."
    The history of the past hundred years, especially the history of the thirty-odd years since the Great October Socialist Revolution, has most fully demonstrated the invincible power of Marxist theory in changing the world. Therefore, studying and mastering Marxist theory has become a universal demand of an increasing number of progressive elements.
    However, this does not mean that the importance of studying theory has been understood by every Communist Party member or even every cadre here. It should be pointed out that here, there are still many comrades who do not understand or do not fully understand the great importance of Marxist theory for our practical work, especially the work of national economic construction. They have done little or no research on the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. They think that Marxists only need to pay attention to practice. This is of course wrong.
    Some comrades think that theory is only useful for formulating major guidelines and policies, and that the major guidelines and policies are decided by the Party Central Committee; we are implementing the established guidelines and policies, and implementing the established guidelines and policies can be done without understanding theory. They do not understand that the Party's guidelines and policies are the conclusions of Marxist theory in practical application. If the people who implement these guidelines and policies only understand individual conclusions, but do not systematically understand Marxist theory, then once they encounter new situations and new problems, they will feel helpless. Such people still cannot truly understand the Party's guidelines and policies, cannot truly consciously and completely implement the Party's guidelines and policies, which will greatly reduce the effectiveness of the work and lead to mistakes.
    Comrade Stalin said in "Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the Eighteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.(B.)": "The higher the political level and the Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the workers in any branch of state and Party work, the better and more fruitful is the work itself, and the more effective are the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and the Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the workers, the more delays and failures there are in the work, and the more the workers themselves are transformed into shortsighted petty men, degenerate into mere routineers concerned only with immediate interests, and the more easily they degenerate and become traitors – this may be regarded as a theorem." This should be a head-on blow to our comrades.
    It can be asserted that in all aspects of state and Party work, especially in the new economic construction work, if we do not strive to study Marxist theory and the theory of socialist economic construction in the Soviet Union, we will certainly not be able to perform our duties. No one can hope to do a good job in economic construction work by relying only on their own limited, one-sided, and incomplete experience. Anyone who is superstitious about their own fragmentary experience as a panacea and does not believe in the great role of Marxist theory will inevitably take detours in their practical work, and even stumble.
    To study theory, we must have determination, and we must abandon all kinds of excuses, such as being busy with work, etc. Our comrades often excuse themselves from studying theory because they are busy with work. Comrade Stalin had already criticized this point. In "The Foundations of Leninism," Comrade Stalin said: "It is well known that many Leninist practical workers do not like theory very much, especially because they are compelled by circumstances to be preoccupied with a vast amount of practical work." Comrade Stalin pointed out that this "is absolutely untrue." Facts have long proven that as long as there is a determination to study theory, the bureaucratic style of being busy with work can be overcome.
    Of course, our theoretical research on the practical problems of economic construction cannot tolerate empty dogmatic manipulations. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have repeatedly stated that "theory is not a dogma, but a guide to action." At present, there are many practical economic problems that our theorists have not seriously studied, and we have not even seriously organized theoretical research in this area, which is equally incompatible with the needs of our national economic construction. We must strive to change this situation.
    The Chinese Communist Party has consistently insisted on improving the Marxist theoretical level of the entire Party, especially emphasizing the study of the new stage of Marxist theoretical development, the study of the theories of Lenin and Stalin and the history of the Soviet Communist Party, and the research work of combining Marxist theory with Chinese reality.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 1938: "It is impossible for a party that leads a great revolutionary movement to achieve victory without revolutionary theory, without historical knowledge, and without a deep understanding of the actual movement." In his speech "Reform Our Study" in 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The study of Marxism-Leninism should also be based on the material centered on the 'Short Course of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'." "We can learn from how Lenin and Stalin combined the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete practice of the Soviet revolution and thus developed Marxism, and we can know how we should work in China." In 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong called in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that "we must learn from the CPSU." These instructions are what we should keep in mind at all times.
    Not long ago, under the call of our Party Central Committee, the entire Party's cadres studied Comrade Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R." and Comrade Malenkov's political report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and gained a great deal. Recently, the Party Central Committee issued the "Instructions on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954," and the entire Party will soon begin to study Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and important works of Lenin and Stalin on socialist economic construction. This will further improve our theoretical learning situation, which will be of great benefit to our country's economic construction.
    As we commemorate the 135th anniversary of Marx's birth, we should study Marxist theory more diligently, because we know that only by fully mastering this ever-victorious theory can we guide the work of national economic construction. We must publicize Marxist theory more widely, because we know that only when theory is increasingly grasped by the people can we guarantee the victory of our country's economic construction.

### 用马克思主义理论来指导我们的国家建设工作——纪念马克思诞生一百三十五周年

    用马克思主义理论来指导我们的国家建设工作
    ——纪念马克思诞生一百三十五周年
    “理论只要一掌握群众，就立刻成为物质的力量。”——这是马克思在他早期的一部著作“黑格尔法律哲学批判导论”中的名言。
    马克思的这句名言是伟大的真理，它日益为颠扑不破的历史事实所证明。
    在这位科学共产主义的创始人、天才的思想家、世界无产阶级的伟大领袖和导师——卡尔·马克思诞生一百三十五周年的今天，马克思主义的理论正掌握着日益广大的人民群众，成为日益强大的物质力量。马克思和他的亲密战友恩格斯关于消灭剥削制度、建设共产主义社会的科学预言在苏联已经成为现实。今天世界三分之一的人口已经解除了帝国主义的枷锁，建立了以苏联为领导的强大的和平民主社会主义阵营，继续实现着马克思和恩格斯的科学预言；他们正在建设着人民的祖国和人民的美好生活，并鼓舞着全世界劳动人民为争取共同的美好生活而斗争。
    马克思主义能够掌握这样广大的群众，发生这样伟大的力量，这就因为它是正确的。列宁在“马克思主义的三个来源和三个组成部分”中说：“马克思学说之所以万能，就是因为它正确。它十分完备而严整，给了人们一个决不同任何迷信、任何反动、任何辩护资产阶级压迫的思想相调和的完整世界观。”
    近百余年来的历史，特别是伟大的十月社会主义革命以后三十几年来的历史，最充分地显示了马克思主义改变世界的理论的不可战胜的力量。因而，学习和掌握马克思主义理论就成为日益众多的进步分子的普遍要求。
    但是，这并不是说在我们这里学习理论的重要性已经被每个共产党员乃至每个干部所了解。应当指出，在我们这里，还有不少同志并不了解或不充分了解马克思主义理论对于我们的实际工作，特别是国家经济建设工作的巨大重要性。他们对于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，还很少研究甚至于没有研究。他们以为马克思主义者只要重视实践就够了。这当然是错误的。
    有一些同志认为理论只是对于制订重大的方针、政策有用处，而重大的方针、政策有党中央来做决定；我们是执行已定的方针、政策的，而执行已定的方针、政策是可以不懂得理论的。他们不了解，党的方针、政策是马克思主义理论在实际运用中的结论，如果执行这些方针、政策的人只懂得个别的结论，而不是系统地懂得马克思主义理论，那末，一旦遇到新的情况和新的问题，他们就会感到无能为力。这样的人就还不能真正懂得党的方针和政策，就还不能真正自觉地完满地执行党的方针和政策，就会使工作的效果大为降低，就会发生错误。
    斯大林同志“在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”中说过：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员的政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高、愈有成效，工作的结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员的政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多，工作人员本身也会愈加变为鼠目寸光的小人，堕落成为一些只图眼前利益的事务主义者，而他们也就愈易蜕化变节，——这要算是一个定理。”这对于我们的同志应该是一个当头棒喝。
    可以断定，在国家工作和党的工作的各方面，特别是在新的经济建设工作中，我们如果不努力学习马克思主义理论，不努力学习苏联社会主义经济建设的理论，就一定不能胜任自己的工作。谁都休想只凭自己的一点点片面的和不完全的经验，就能够把经济建设的工作做好。谁要是迷信自己的片断经验为万应灵药，而不相信马克思主义理论的巨大作用，谁就不可避免地会在实际工作中走弯路，甚至于会栽跟头。
    要学习理论必须有决心，必须抛弃各种各样的借口，如工作繁忙等等。我们的同志往往因为工作繁忙而原谅自己不学习理论。关于这一点，斯大林同志早已批评过了。在“论列宁主义基础”一书中，斯大林同志说：“大家也知道，现在许多列宁主义的实际工作者不很喜爱理论，特别是因为他们由于环境关系而不得不忙于浩繁的实际工作。”斯大林同志指出，这“是绝对不合于事实的”。事实早已证明只要有决心学习理论，就可以克服工作繁忙的事务主义作风。
    我们对于现实的经济建设问题的理论研究，当然也不能容许空洞的教条式的搬弄。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林都曾反复地说明“理论不是教条而是行动的指南”。目前有许多实际的经济问题，我们的理论工作者并没有加以认真的研究，甚至于我们还没有认真地组织这一方面的理论研究工作，这同样是和我们的国家经济建设的需要不相适应的。我们必须努力改变这种状况。
    中国共产党一贯地坚持要提高全党的马克思主义理论水准，特别重视学习马克思主义理论发展的新阶段，重视学习列宁、斯大林的学说和苏联共产党的历史，重视把马克思主义理论与中国实际相结合的研究工作。
    毛泽东同志在一九三八年中国共产党第六届中央委员会第六次全体会议上说：“指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有对于实际运动的深刻的了解，要取得胜利是不可能的。”在一九四一年“改造我们的学习”的演说中，毛泽东同志指出：“研究马克思列宁主义，又应以‘苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本’为中心的材料。”“我们看列宁、斯大林他们是如何把马克思主义的普遍真理和苏联革命的具体实践互相结合又从而发展马克思主义的，就可以知道我们在中国是应该如何地工作了。”一九四九年毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中号召“我们必须向联共学习”。这些指示都是我们时时刻刻应该牢记的。
    不久以前，在我们党中央号召之下，全党干部学习斯大林同志的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的政治报告，有了很大收获。最近党中央发布了“关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”，全党即将开始学习“联共（布）党史”第九章到第十二章和列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设的重要著作。这将使我们的理论学习状况有进一步的改善，这对于我国经济建设事业将会有重大的益处。
    当我们纪念马克思诞生一百三十五周年的时候，我们应该更加勤奋地学习马克思主义理论，因为我们知道，只有完全掌握了这个百战百胜的理论，我们才能指导国家经济建设的工作。我们要更加广泛地宣传马克思主义理论，因为我们知道，只有理论日益众多地掌握了人民群众，才能保证我国经济建设的胜利。
