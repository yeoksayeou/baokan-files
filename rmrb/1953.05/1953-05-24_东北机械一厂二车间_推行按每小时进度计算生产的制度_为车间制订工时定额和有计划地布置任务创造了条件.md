The Second Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1 Improves the Original Record-Keeping System and Initially Implements a Method of Production Based on Hourly Progress

The Second Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1 has been organizing production according to instruction charts. Although it has basically achieved rhythmic production, there are still many problems with the original records and labor quotas. Firstly, the original records are inaccurate. The recorders' method of recording each day is: they record whatever the workers say, so the records often do not match the actual production time. For example, on February 8th, worker Zhang Zhenxun of the Second Work Section actually worked for three hours, and stopped working for five hours due to changing materials and grinding knives, but reported to the recorder that he worked for six hours and waited for materials for two hours.

Because the leadership could not grasp the actual production time, they had to find veteran workers and team leaders to discuss when setting product labor quotas each time. However, the labor quotas set in this way were also difficult to be accurate, and there was inevitably blindness when assigning tasks. As a result, after assigning a month's production plan, some machine tools could barely complete it, while others could complete it in twenty days, forming a serious waste of working hours, and the plan lost its guiding role.

Also, because the records cannot accurately reflect the actual production situation of each producer, the individual piece-rate wage system of more pay for more work cannot be correctly implemented.

For example, on a horizontal lathe, three veteran technicians work in shifts to make the No. 407 headstock. Often, if one person produces a defective product, the other two people also get less wages. This affects the workers' enthusiasm.

In addition to causing difficulties in formulating production plans, the inaccuracy of the original records also affects the accuracy of the workshop's cost accounting.

When formulating this year's production plan and tapping production potential, Wang Wenshan, the director of the workshop, believed that improving the original record-keeping system was the key to improving workshop management. Failure to solve this problem would affect the completion of the national plan. Therefore, he first studied the Soviet advanced experience of hourly production progress. After obtaining the consent of the workshop's Party branch and the factory's Party general branch committee, he decided to promote this advanced experience and strengthen plan management.

After Wang Wenshan, the workshop executive managers, recorders, and statisticians repeatedly studied and discussed the Soviet advanced experience of hourly production progress, they decided on specific improvement measures. They further subdivided the processing procedures, changed the past method of calculating working hours by large processes to calculating by small processes, and marked the plan of how many procedures the workers need to complete each day with blue lines on the charts, and marked how much the workers actually complete each hour with red lines. The recorders make records according to the planned lines and actual completion lines every hour, and the executive managers and statisticians use the records to schedule tasks and count working hours, and use this to calculate the piece-rate wages each worker should receive.

The Second Workshop only comprehensively implemented it after obtaining experience through key trials. This workshop found the following problems in key trials: 1. In terms of production management, workers had to collect the materials for making tools themselves, wasting production time. For example, worker Wang Lianzhu of the Fourth Work Section once spent two hours collecting materials for making a fixture; some workers also counted the working hours for repairing machine tools (minor repairs) as production time; some workers averaged the daily production volume over eight hours when reporting. These all affected the implementation of hourly production progress. 2. In terms of technical management, the supply of tools was not timely, and no one was responsible for the tools during the third shift, making it difficult for workers to collect tools; the cutting tools used for cutting materials were inconsistent, some were wide and some were narrow, so the consumption of raw materials and product quality could not be well controlled. 3. Ideological obstacles. Some workers thought that such a change would make it difficult to calculate accounts; some people thought it was troublesome, thinking that drawing progress every hour would delay production; even some recorders and dispatchers also thought it was troublesome. For example, some dispatchers said: "If we are pulling in different directions every day, and then draw progress, we will definitely not be able to handle it in the future."

Based on these problems, the Second Workshop made further improvements during comprehensive implementation. Firstly, it clarified the scope of the recorders' work as: registering processing results according to small processes; recording quality inspection results; summarizing working hours and calculating piece-rate wages. Secondly, it strengthened the work of the tool room, equipped it with dedicated personnel to manage tools, and the tools and raw materials used by the workers were delivered to the machine tools by warehouse personnel, reducing the waste of production time. In terms of overcoming ideological obstacles, the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League strengthened political and ideological leadership, mobilized Party members, Communist Youth League members, and young workers to take the lead in implementation, and also mobilized apprentices to help technicians draw progress, promoting the implementation of hourly production progress.

After implementation, it has received great results, initially ensuring the correctness of the original records, creating conditions for the workshop to establish labor quotas and arrange tasks in a planned way; output and quality have generally improved. For example, it used to take 7 minutes and 40 seconds to make a No. 102 large frame component, but recently it has been shortened to 5 minutes and 2 seconds. At the same time, due to clarifying responsibilities, defective products have gradually decreased; because the wage policy of more pay for more work has been implemented more correctly, workers' production enthusiasm has increased. Within twenty days, thirty-five tips and tricks appeared, solving key problems in production. For example, worker Hu Jisheng worked hard to improve his skills in making headstocks, and did not produce a single defective product from March 1st to 20th.

Although there have been the above initial achievements, it is necessary to continue to improve and consolidate. For example, quality inspection work has not yet reached the point of inspecting by hour and by process; some records and forms have not yet been revised; workers are afraid that such progress charts will not be used for long; some dispatchers and recorders have not yet overcome the idea of finding it troublesome; even some cadres are not very confident in this; the wage department is afraid that wages will be difficult to calculate. These all need to be further improved and overcome.

    东北机械一厂二车间
    推行按每小时进度计算生产的制度
    为车间制订工时定额和有计划地布置任务创造了条件
    东北机械一厂二车间，改进原始记录制度，初步实行按每小时进度生产的办法。
    机械一厂二车间按指示图表组织生产以来，虽然基本上达到了有节奏的生产，但原始记录和工时定额还有很多问题。首先是原始记录不准确，记录员每天记录的方法是：工人说多少就记多少，因而记录往往与实际生产工时不符。如二工段工人张振勋在二月八日，实际做了三个小时的活，因换料和磨刀停工五小时，但向记录员报的是做活六小时、待料两小时。
    由于领导方面掌握不住实际生产工时，在每次制订产品工时定额的时候，就不得不现找老工人和小组长来讨论。但这样制订的工时定额也是很难准确的，在布置任务时就难免有盲目性。因而往往在布置一个月的生产计划之后，有的机床仅能勉强完成，有的二十天就能完成，形成严重浪费工时的现象，计划失去指导作用。
    又由于记录不能准确地反映每个生产者的实际生产情况，就不能正确地贯彻多劳多得的个人计件工资制度。
    如在一台躺镟上是三名老技工倒班，做四○七号床头箱，往往因一个人出了废品，其他两个人也跟着少得工资。这都影响到工人积极性的发挥。
    原始记录的不正确，除了给制订生产计划造成困难外，还影响到车间成本核算的准确性。
    在制订今年生产计划，挖掘生产潜力时，车间主任王文山认为改进原始记录制度是改进车间管理的关键问题，不解决这个问题完成国家计划就要受到影响。于是他首先研究了苏联按小时进度生产的先进经验，在取得了车间党支部和厂党总支委员会的同意后，决定推广这个先进经验，加强计划管理。
    王文山和车间执令管理者、记录员、统计员，反复学习和讨论了苏联按小时进度生产的先进经验以后，就决定了具体改进办法，进一步把加工程序细分一下，把过去以大工序计算工时改为以小工序计算，把工人每天需要完成几道工序的计划用蓝线标示在图表上，工人每小时实际完成多少用红线标示。记录员每小时根据计划线和实际完成线作纪录，执令管理员和统计员就根据记录来调度任务和统计工时，并以此来计算每个工人应得的计件工资。
    第二车间经过重点试验取得经验后，才全面推行。这个车间在重点试验中发现下面几个问题：一、在生产管理方面，工人做工具用的材料要自己去领，浪费生产时间，如四工段工人王连柱有一次领做胎具的料就用去了两小时；有的工人把修理机床（小修）的工时也算在生产时间内；有的工人把一天的生产量平均起来按八小时报。这些都影响着推行按小时进度生产的推行。二、在技术管理方面，刀具供应不及时，到第三班时工具无人负责，工人领工具困难；切料用的车刀不一致，有宽有窄，不能很好地控制原材料消耗量和产品质量。三、思想障碍。有的工人认为这样一改不好算账；有的人嫌麻烦，认为一小时一画进度，耽误生产；甚至有的记录员和调度员也嫌麻烦，如有的调度员说：“每天东拉西扯的，再画进度，将来一定干不过来。”
    根据这些问题，二车间在全面推行时作了进一步的改进。首先明确了记录员的业务范围为：按小工序登记加工成果；记载质量检查成果；总结工时，计算计件工资。其次是加强了工具室的工作，配备专人负责管理刀具，工人用的工具和原材料都由仓库人员送到机床来，减少生产工时的浪费。在克服思想障碍方面，党、工会、青年团加强了政治思想领导，动员党员、青年团员、青年工人带头实行，并且动员徒工帮助技工画进度，把按小时进度生产推行起来。
    推行之后，收到很大效果，初步保证了原始记录的正确性，为车间制订工时定额和有计划地布置任务创造了条件；产量、质量普遍提高，如做一○二大架子部件，以前是七点四十分钟，最近已缩短到五点零二分钟，同时由于分清责任，废品已逐渐减少；由于比较正确地贯彻了多劳多得的工资政策，工人生产热情提高，二十天内就出现了三十五个窍门，解决了生产上的关键问题，如工人胡纪生做床头箱，努力提高技术，从三月一日到二十日没出一个废品。
    虽然有了以上的初步成绩，但还要继续提高和巩固。如质量检查工作还没有达到按小时按工序检查；有的记录和表格还没有改好；工人怕这样的进度表用不长；有的调度员和记录员还没有克服嫌麻烦的思想；甚至有的干部对此信心不大；工资科怕工资不好计算，这些都必须进一步加以改进和克服。
