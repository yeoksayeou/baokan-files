    The Vietnamese Working Class Struggles for National Independence and World Peace
    -- Interview with Tran Bao, Head of the Vietnamese Trade Union Delegation
    By our reporter Tan Wenrui
    Comrade Tran Bao, head of the trade union delegation from fighting Vietnam, began his conversation with reporters by conveying the victorious news from the Vietnamese and Laotian fronts. He excitedly told us about the recent victories of the Vietnamese People's Army's surprise attack on Jian'an City near Haiphong and the Laotian People's Liberation Army's liberation of the entire province of Sam Neua. We quickly realized that every victory in the Vietnamese resistance war is inseparable from the efforts of workers in the Vietnamese liberated areas to support the front lines with selfless labor, and the heroic struggle of workers in French-occupied areas to oppose the French imperialists' vicious plot to "use war to support war and use Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese." Comrade Tran Bao is a veteran fighter and leader of the Vietnamese labor movement, so we asked him to talk about the current situation of the Vietnamese working class's struggle for national independence and the defense of world peace.
    The Vietnamese people have liberated most of their motherland's territory, with only some coastal cities and a small area in the south still occupied by the French imperialists. Therefore, the Vietnamese labor movement is carried out in two different forms of struggle in the liberated areas and the French-occupied areas. Comrade Tran Bao first talked about the situation of the labor movement in the liberated areas, pointing out: "The major achievement of the Vietnamese working class in the liberated areas in 1952 was to greatly promote the patriotic production competition movement to complete the country's production increase and savings plan." The Vietnamese Industrial Competition Summary Conference held last March and the Vietnamese National Patriotic Competition Model Workers Conference held in May summarized the experience of five years of production struggle and self-reliance. President Ho Chi Minh's instructions on patriotic competition and the explanation of the new heroism by Comrade Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Lao Dong Party, further clarified the purpose, significance, form, and content of patriotic competition for the Vietnamese working people, and strengthened their determination and confidence in striving for victory. On August 19, 1952, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor launched the "Ngo Gia Kham Patriotic Competition Movement," making patriotic competition collective and regular. The broad working class voluntarily and consciously actively participated in the competition movement and launched a wave of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. For example, more than 80 percent of the workers in Bac Giang City participated in collective competition movements.
    In launching the "Ngo Gia Kham Patriotic Competition Movement," workers learned from the competition experience of the Ma Hengchang production team in China, organized teams in large factories, and organized mutual aid teams in small workshops to participate in the competition. Several typical teams and dozens of mutual aid teams have been initially cultivated last year. These teams and mutual aid teams played a major role in the patriotic competition movement. They organized workers to discuss production plans and ensure the completion of plans. Each team made a production convention to ensure compliance with labor discipline, strive to improve technology, put forward rationalization proposals, improve product quality, and reduce production costs. A model team in the K-102 factory put forward 17 rationalization proposals in five months, increasing output by 21 percent. The "Cao Viet Bao team" in another factory increased output by 200 percent in successfully completing the task of supplying weapons for the "Northwest Campaign."
    As a result of the patriotic competition launched by the workers last year, various industrial departments generally improved technology, increased production, and reduced product costs. Comrade Tran Bao cited some figures to illustrate this achievement. He said: "Compared with 1951, coal production increased by 50 percent, lead increased by 154 percent, tin increased by 159 percent, and munitions increased by 45 percent. The transportation industry has also greatly developed, and the number of many kinds of transportation tools has increased. For example, the number of animal-powered vehicles has increased by 180 percent. Agricultural tool manufacturing has not only increased output but also reduced product costs by 20 to 30 percent. Some factories increased production by 136 percent last year." Intellectual workers also made a lot of contributions in this, and they have many creations and inventions in improving technology in industry, agriculture, and other aspects. For example, Comrade Tran Dai Nghia, an engineer and member of the Vietnamese trade union delegation who came to China this time, was awarded the Third-Class Military Merit Medal and the First-Class Resistance Medal and the title of National Labor Model for his outstanding contributions to the military industry.
    While workers launched patriotic competitions, factories implemented democratic management, and workers participated in factory management, which further improved their production enthusiasm. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the work style and work methods of leading cadres have also improved. Therefore, the rational organization of production departments was implemented last year to save manpower. Some factories and institutions reduced their personnel by 2 percent, and their production increased by 20 percent compared to before. Several factories increased by 100 to 150 percent.
    In addition to actively producing to support the front lines, the workers in the liberated areas also vigorously assisted farmers in overcoming the difficulties in agricultural production. Trade unions and peasant associations in various places jointly organized cooperatives to manufacture agricultural tools, and supplied farmers with a large number of production tools. They also helped farmers solve fertilizer and irrigation problems. The French aggressors wantonly bombed the dikes in the liberated areas, attempting to destroy Vietnam's agricultural production. The workers helped the farmers install machine pumping stations for irrigation, and the trade unions in the Fifth Interzone completed the task of installing 200 such pumping stations. Trade unions in various places also often organized workers to help farmers cultivate during holidays. During the collection of agricultural taxes, they also organized workers to help farmers understand the tax rules and complete the task of paying public grain. The unity of Vietnamese workers and peasants in production and combat is constantly strengthened, and the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance is becoming increasingly solid.
    The environment for the Vietnamese resistance war is very difficult, but the Lao Dong Party and the Vietnamese government pay close attention to improving the lives of the workers. Last year, the government stipulated that part of the wages should be paid in kind, and subsidies were given to workers with heavy family burdens. The cultural life of workers is also gradually improving.
    The situation of Vietnamese workers in French-occupied areas is becoming increasingly miserable. Comrade Tran Bao talked about the increasingly cruel oppression and exploitation they are subjected to by the French imperialists, and their heroic struggle. He said: Due to the dumping of American goods, many civilian industrial factories in the French-occupied areas have closed down or stopped production, and the number of unemployed workers has greatly increased. Among the more than 200,000 workers in Hanoi, more than 100,000 are unemployed or semi-employed. These unemployed workers have lost their livelihood and wander the streets in extreme poverty. The enemy often forcibly drags them to build fortifications, giving them only two rice balls a day to satisfy their hunger. Even workers who have jobs have a very hard life. The enemy implements so-called "rational organization," intensifies the extraction of workers' labor, and makes one person do the work of two, working long hours every day. Due to the economic disorder in the enemy-occupied areas, prices have soared, and workers' actual income is becoming increasingly meager. For example, the price of rice quadrupled in 1952, but workers' wages only increased by 10 to 16 percent. In addition, various exorbitant taxes and levies are constantly increasing, and the puppet currency is depreciating, and the lives of the workers are deteriorating day by day. The French imperialists and their puppets have used all kinds of terrorist methods to suppress workers' resistance, and wantonly persecute patriotic workers. For example, workers in the Hai Phong cement factory often work under the encirclement and surveillance of armed military police. Twenty-four workers were arrested from the Hai Phong shipyard, four of whom were tortured to death, and the whereabouts of the remaining twenty are unknown. In order to facilitate control, the Saigon puppet regime even sent special agents to burn down the workers' residences and forced them to live in concentration. On the other hand, the French imperialists and their Bao Dai puppets also used various despicable means such as sending special agents to organize yellow trade unions and promulgating deceptive "labor laws" to divide the workers in an attempt to weaken the workers' will to fight. However, the broad masses of workers in the enemy-occupied areas firmly believe in the correct leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Lao Dong Party, and the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, and are strengthening their unity and carrying out an indomitable struggle. They often use work stoppages and other methods to insist on wage increases. Workers in the four northern cities carried out 51 such struggles in the second half of 1952. At the same time, the workers united with patriotic people from other strata to oppose the enemy's reactionary measures such as conscription, forced labor, and tax increases, and sabotaged the enemy's production and military equipment to strike at the enemy's plot to "use war to support war." Last year, they carried out five major sabotages, burning down the Hai Phong cement factory's material warehouse, the Guang'an military warehouse, and the Saigon gasoline depot, causing great losses to the enemy.
    Comrade Tran Bao concluded: "The Vietnamese working class is carrying out different forms of struggle in the liberated areas and the enemy-occupied areas, all for the same purpose: to strive for the final victory of the national liberation movement and to defend world peace. According to incomplete statistics, 120,000 workers have signed the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty, which also shows the will of the Vietnamese working class to defend world peace. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and the defense of world peace will surely achieve final victory!"

    越南工人阶级为争取民族独立和保卫世界和平而斗争
    ——访越南工会代表团团长陈保
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    来自战斗的越南的工会代表团团长陈保同志是以传达越南和寮国前线的胜利消息开始和记者们谈话的。他兴奋地把最近越南人民军奇袭海防附近建安城和寮国人民解放军解放桑怒全省的捷报告诉我们。我们很快就想到，越南抗战的每一个胜利，都是和越南解放区的工人们以忘我劳动支援前线的努力和法占区的工人们为反对法国帝国主义者“以战养战，用越南人打越南人”的恶毒阴谋而进行的英勇斗争分不开的。陈保同志是越南工人运动的一位老战士和领导者，因此我们请他谈谈越南工人阶级争取民族独立，保卫世界和平的斗争的近况。
    越南人民已解放了祖国绝大部分的土地，只有沿海的若干城市和南部的狭小地区仍在法国帝国主义者盘踞下。因此越南的工人运动在解放区和法占区中是以两种不同的斗争形式进行的。陈保同志首先谈到解放区工人运动的情况，他指出：“越南解放区工人阶级在一九五二年所获得的重大成就，就是大大地推进了爱国主义生产竞赛运动，来完成国家的增产节约计划。”去年三月召开的越南工业竞赛总结大会和五月召开的越南全国爱国主义竞赛模范者大会，总结了五年来生产斗争和自力更生的经验。胡志明主席对爱国竞赛的指示和劳动党总书记长征同志关于新的英雄主义的阐释，使越南劳动人民更进一步地明确了爱国主义竞赛的目的、意义、形式和内容，而加强了他们争取胜利的决心和信心。一九五二年八月十九日越南全国总工会发动了“吴嘉嵌爱国竞赛运动”，使爱国竞赛步入集体化和经常化。广大的工人阶级自愿自觉地积极投入了竞赛运动中，并展开了学习苏联、中国和各人民民主国家先进经验的热潮。如北?城的工人，就有百分之八十以上参加了集体的竞赛运动。
    在展开“吴嘉嵌爱国竞赛运动”中，工人们学习了中国马恒昌生产小组的竞赛经验，在大的工厂中组织了小组，在小的工场中组织了互助小组参加竞赛，去年已初步培养了几个典型小组和几十个互助小组。这些小组和互助小组在爱国竞赛运动中起了很大的作用，它们组织工人讨论生产计划，保证计划的完成。各小组都订立了生产公约，保证遵守劳动纪律，努力改进技术，提出合理化建议，提高产品的质量和降低生产成本。K一○二工厂中的一个模范小组，在五个月内提出了十七件合理化建议，提高了产量百分之二十一。另一个工厂中的“高越保小组”，在胜利完成供应“西北战役”武器的任务当中，把产量提高了百分之二百。
    工人们去年展开了爱国竞赛的结果，各种工业部门普遍改进了技术，提高了生产量，降低了产品的成本。陈保同志举出一些数字来说明这种成绩。他说：“一九五二年与一九五一年比较，煤的产量增加了百分之五十，铅增加了百分之一百五十四，锡增加了百分之一百五十九，军火增加了百分之四十五。运输事业也有很大的发展，许多种运输工具的数量都有了增加，如兽力车就增多了百分之一百八十。农具制造业不但增加了产量，而且把产品成本降低了百分之二十到三十。有些工厂去年把生产量提高了百分之一百三十六。”在这里面，脑力劳动者也作了不少的贡献，他们在改进工业、农业和其他方面的技术都有许多创造发明。像这次到中国来的越南工会代表团的团员、工程师陈大义同志，就是因为在军事工业方面有卓越的贡献荣获第三等军功勋章和第一等抗战勋章及全国劳动模范称号。
    与工人展开爱国竞赛的同时，工厂实行了民主管理，工人参加了工厂的管理，生产积极性因而进一步提高；在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，领导干部的工作作风和工作方法也有了改进；因此去年实行生产部门合理编制，节约人力，有的工厂和机关减少了百分之二的人员，生产量反而比以前增加了百分之二十，有几个工厂并增加了百分之一百到一百五十。
    解放区的工人除了积极生产支援前线之外，并且大力协助农民克服农业生产中的困难。各地的工会与农会联合组织制造农具的合作社，大量供应农民生产工具；并帮助农民解决肥料和灌溉问题。法国侵略者对解放区的堤坝狂轰滥炸，企图摧毁越南的农业生产，工人们就帮助农民装设机器汲水站进行灌溉，第五联区的工会便完成了安设两百个这种汲水站的任务。各地工会并经常组织工人利用假期帮助农民耕种；在征收农业税当中，又组织了工人帮助农民了解税则，完成缴纳公粮的任务。越南工人和农民在生产中和战斗中的团结不断加强，使工农联盟的基础日益巩固。
    越南的抗战环境是很艰苦的，但是劳动党和越南人民政府十分注意改善工人的生活。去年人民政府规定了在工资中发给一部分实物，对于家庭负担较重的工人并给予津贴。工人的文化生活也在逐步提高。
    法占区的越南工人的境况则愈来愈悲惨。陈保同志谈到他们遭受法帝国主义者日益残酷的压迫与剥削的状况、以及他们进行英勇斗争的情形。他说：由于美国货的倾销，法军占领区许多民用工业的工厂纷纷倒闭或停工，失业工人数目大量增加。河内二十多万工人中，就有十多万失业或半失业者。这些失业工人失去了生活的依靠，流浪街头，困苦万状。敌人经常强拉他们去修筑工事，每天只给两个饭团充饥。就是有工作的工人，生活也是很苦的。敌人实行所谓“合理化组织”，加紧榨取工人的劳动力，两个人的工作让一个人去做，每天工作时间很长；由于敌占区经济紊乱，物价狂涨，工人的实际收入愈来愈少得可怜。像一九五二年米价就涨了四倍，但是工人的工资却只增加了百分之十到十六。加以各种苛捐杂税不断增加，伪币贬值，工人的生活一天比一天恶化。法国帝国主义者及其傀儡，为了镇压工人的反抗，用尽了各种恐怖手段，肆意迫害爱国的工人。例如海防水泥厂的工人经常在武装军警的包围监视下进行工作。海防修船厂有一次被抓走了二十四名工人，有四名被拷打死亡，其余二十名不知下落。西贡的伪政权为了便于管制，竟派特务把工人的住所烧毁，强迫他们集中居住。另一方面，法帝国主义者及其保大傀儡，又利用派遣特务组织黄色工会、颁布骗人的“劳动法”等各种卑鄙手段，在工人中进行分化，企图削弱工人的斗争意志。但是敌占区的广大工人坚信胡志明主席和劳动党和越南总工会的正确领导，加强团结进行着不屈不挠的斗争。他们经常用怠工等方式坚持增加工资的要求。北部的四个城市的工人，在一九五二年下半年就进行了五十一次这样的斗争。同时工人们并团结了其他各阶层的爱国人民，反对敌人征兵、拉夫、增税等反动措施，破坏敌人的生产和军事设备，来打击敌人“以战养战”的阴谋。他们去年进行了五次大破坏，焚毁了海防水泥厂的材料库、广安的军用仓库和西贡的汽油库等，使敌人遭到很大的损失。
    陈保同志最后说：“越南的工人阶级在解放区和敌占区进行着不同方式的斗争，都是为着同一的目的：争取民族解放运动的最后胜利与保卫世界和平。根据不完全的统计，已有十二万的工人在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名，这也显示了越南工人阶级保卫世界和平的意志。我们坚决相信，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的英明领导下，越南人民争取祖国独立和保卫世界和平的斗争，一定能取得最后的胜利！”
