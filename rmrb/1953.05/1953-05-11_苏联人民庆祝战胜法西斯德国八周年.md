    苏联人民庆祝战胜法西斯德国八周年
    据新华社讯：苏联人民正在庆祝苏联战胜法西斯德国八周年纪念日。在城市和农村中，在军事单位里，在战舰上，苏联人民纷纷举行关于苏联战胜德国帝国主义的历史性意义的报告会、讲演会和座谈会。各地还举行了大规模的射击比赛、机器脚踏车比赛、骑马比赛和汽车比赛。
    八日，苏联英雄、炮兵上将纳·赫列布尼科夫在苏联政治与科学知识普及协会中央大厅作了讲演，题目是“共产党是使苏联武装部队在伟大卫国战争中取得胜利的鼓舞者和组织者”。斯大林汽车工厂文化宫的小音乐厅内举行了胜利日大会。
    几天来许多苏军战士、莫斯科工人和学生前往莫斯科苏军中央博物馆参观。
    在军旗大厅的中央屹立着斯大林大元帅的雕像。厅内排列着苏军在伟大卫国战争中击败德国帝国主义者时打着的红旗。博物馆里的展览品表明了伟大卫国战争各主要阶段的情形，以及苏军领袖和苏联民族英雄——格斯吉罗、马特洛索夫、潘菲洛夫式战士、克拉斯诺顿的青年近卫军——的事迹。博物馆里陈列着被炮弹碎片和子弹打破了的军旗，狙击兵的步枪，以及获得了不可磨灭的光辉的坦克、飞机和军舰的模型。博物馆里还展览着中国人民赠送给苏军的一座斯大林和毛泽东的浮雕像。有一个大厅里陈列着被苏军解放的各国人民赠送给苏军的礼物，如匈牙利劳动人民为纪念苏军解放布达佩斯而兴建的纪念碑的模型。这些展览品都充分表现了各国人民对战无不胜的苏军的热爱。
