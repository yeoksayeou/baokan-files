Geologists are Courageously Advancing for the Construction of the Motherland
    Li Siguang

    (I)
    The liberated Chinese people, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, have victoriously completed various preparatory tasks over the past three years. Now, the historic First Five-Year Plan has begun, and the motherland is embarking on the path of large-scale industrial construction that we have long yearned for.
    The natural conditions for industrial construction mainly consist of two major aspects: 1. Power; 2. Raw materials.
    In the past, in an agricultural society dominated by feudalistic production relations, the utilization of natural power was extremely limited, and the methods of utilization were also extremely uneconomical. In the future, if we want to develop production on a large scale, we must consider how to use these power resources—coal, oil (including natural gas), and water power—in the most rational and economical way.
    Coal and oil are underground treasures. They are preserved in strata of different depths and are not easily discovered at once. Therefore, before we formulate plans to mine these treasures on a large scale, we must first understand their existence underground—how they are distributed underground, and in which geological periods and strata they originated. We must also understand which type of strata and which type of area (such as intermountain basins, foreland depressions, ancient lakes, ancient bays, or ancient inland shallow seas, etc.) are most closely related to the coal and oil formed under different paleogeographic environments and paleoclimatic conditions. We must also understand which geological structures are most suitable for preserving them. This work is to be done by geologists.
    Hydropower generation is the conversion of water power into electricity, which is a series of complex tasks. A major part of this work includes the investigation and research of the general topography and geological conditions of the water source area, the laws of local river erosion, and the rock properties and structures of certain important bases, especially the selection of dam sites for reservoirs. Obviously, this is also the task of geologists.
    In addition to the above three power sources, another very important power source is radioactive materials, especially uranium and thorium. They form various minerals and are distributed in various different rocks. Modern physics has long discovered the significant fact that a large amount of power can be liberated from these substances. The US imperialists have been妄想 [attempting vainly] to monopolize the source of this energy, making it into weapons for mass slaughter of the people, such as atomic bombs; while in our peace camp led by the Soviet Union, we must utilize it, and in fact, we are already trying to utilize this power to engage in peaceful construction and serve peaceful industry. The Soviet Union has made great achievements in utilizing this capability in its massive projects to transform nature. In our country, in certain regions where coal and other power sources are relatively lacking, obtaining power sources from radioactive minerals should not be ignored in the future.
    As is well known, the raw materials needed for industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction, are mostly obtained from underground resources. Among them, particularly important are various ferrous metals, such as iron, manganese, chromium; various non-ferrous metals, such as copper, lead, zinc, tin, tungsten; and various common alloy raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, etc.; various precious metal raw materials, such as platinum, iridium, mercury, etc.; various rare elements, such as cerium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, germanium, osmium, yttrium, etc.; various aluminum ores, such as bauxite, alunite, etc. Secondly, there are various refractory materials, including magnesite, silica brick, dolomite, asbestos, refractory clay, and several high-temperature catalytic minerals such as sillimanite, etc. Furthermore, there are graphite, mica, quartz, etc. as electrical engineering materials; sulfur, borax, barite, niter, potash, apatite, gypsum, limestone, argillaceous minerals and rocks, etc. as chemical raw materials and fertilizers; bentonite, fuller's earth, diatomaceous earth, and certain rare elements, etc. as catalysts. There are many other raw materials, which will not be listed here one by one. Discovering these raw materials, providing the possibility of exploiting them, and ensuring the supply of these industrial raw materials are also one of the main tasks of geologists today.
    In addition to the above two aspects of work, geologists must also provide many engineering designs with relevant basic data as the basis for construction design, including basic data for the foundations of large buildings, factories, ports, airports, tunnels, bridges, etc. in basic construction. The reservoir dam sites mentioned earlier are also one of them. These are all problems in engineering geology. In order to understand the nature and structure of the foundation, its compressive strength and resistance to erosion, we must combine the knowledge obtained from rock and mineral aspects, structural geology aspects, and even geomechanics aspects, with the study of rock properties and hydrogeology. In limestone areas, special attention must be paid to these issues.

    (II)
    In the past three years, geologists across the country have enthusiastically responded to the call of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, conducted self-education from work practice, transformed the past academic research style, and aroused a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm to serve the people and the motherland, thereby achieving certain results in their work. At the same time, the brilliant achievements of advanced Soviet science and technology applied to geological work, and the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people demonstrated by Soviet experts, deeply moved us, and thus we have set off a new upsurge of responding to Chairman Mao's call and demanding to learn from the Soviet Union. On this basis, the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government convened a national conference of geological workers in Beijing in early 1953. This conference, on the one hand, enabled our geological workers to more accurately recognize the great significance of the huge tasks entrusted to us by the motherland; on the other hand, enthusiastically studied the advanced experience of Soviet geological work, formulated various work norms, standardized our work, and thus strengthened our confidence in our work. In this way, the attitude of our geological staff has undergone a fundamental change: ending the past free and undisciplined style, and for the first time formulating a geological work plan suitable for the requirements of the motherland's heavy industrial construction. At the same time, the formulation of various work norms and operating procedures has ensured the completion of this year's plan. Of course, we cannot say that these plans and procedures are already perfect; but we firmly believe that going from nothing to something is a big step forward.
    Today, if we look back at our previous work methods, we can at least have the following insights:
    1. In the past, field geological work relied solely on natural outcrops for inference, seeing as much as could be seen on the surface; even when drilling work was sometimes coordinated, it was also limited by the influence of capitalist society, unwilling to invest more, so most of it still relied on geological personnel to guess. The information obtained in this way was obviously very limited, and even unreliable in some cases. But today, we can use systematic layout of drilling and large-scale soil stripping work. Therefore, we can accurately estimate the underground mineral resources based on more reliable geological data.
    2. The greatest progress we have made in work methods is standardization and planning. We know that in order to ensure the realization of a certain heavy industrial construction plan, it is necessary to ensure the supply of various raw materials required in this plan for several years. To ensure the supply of raw materials, it is first necessary to ensure the accurate reserve figures of the raw materials are presented. Advanced Soviet experience tells us that in order to determine the mineral reserves required for industrial construction, they are divided into five grades according to the accuracy of estimation: A1, A2, B, C1, and C2. When specifically carrying out an industrial design, it is stipulated what grade of mineral quantity must be obtained for various raw materials. Geological work is arranged according to the above requirements, and also according to the geological conditions of the mining area, to arrange a certain amount of drilling, trenching, and other mountain work.
    We know that according to the actual needs of surveying mineral products and other geological conditions, it is necessary to survey and produce geological maps of appropriate scales. Advanced Soviet experience also tells us that in order to ensure the accuracy required by a certain scale geological map, it is necessary to stipulate how many observation points (called geological points) must be established within a certain area (such as one square kilometer). According to these regulations, we can calculate how many geological, surveying, trenching... and other technical cadres and administrative cadres must be equipped to complete a certain area of a certain scale geological map and require it to be done with what kind of precision, how much time it will take, and how much equipment and funding will be needed.
    If we do not have the two basic concepts of geological points and mineral quantity grading as a foundation, we cannot pre-estimate our work in terms of quantity, quality, personnel, time, and materials, and we cannot design any plan, let alone plan how many technical cadres of various levels and departments we need to train.
    3. Standing on the position of serving the national construction cause, most of our geological workers have realized that not only is our political understanding insufficient, and our general ideological study insufficient, but we also deeply feel that our past work attitude was mostly not serious enough, and the scientific value of many of our past works is not without problems. The most significant shortcomings in connecting with reality are that everyone has ignored the necessary engineering knowledge, and has paid too little attention to hydrogeology, geomechanics (or soil mechanics), and the special development of the most recent geological era, namely the Quaternary geology.
    4. The formulation of various work norms and operating procedures has changed the past free and undisciplined style, and at the same time has enabled various tasks to be carried out rhythmically and harmoniously. This has enabled geological survey work, drilling work, and other mountain work to be combined with laboratory work into a holistic effort to serve industrial construction.
    The above-mentioned points are facts that have long been practiced in some industrial and mining sectors with relatively tight organization; but for geological work, it can be said to be a great revolution.

    (III)
    In the first quarter of this year's plan, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, and the appropriate coordination of drilling, mountain work, laboratory work, and geological survey work, we have achieved certain results. Taking non-ferrous metal mines as an example: the potential reserves we have recently discovered have completely shattered the absurd claim imposed on us by imperialism that "China is large but not abundant in resources." In the southwest, we have once again discovered a vast lead-zinc mining area with a world-class status. And the claim that "China is a copper-poor country" is also about to be proven absurd. Based on the results of our current exploration nationwide, we have strong reasons to believe that soon we will be able to present sufficient data to prove that our motherland will catch up with the world's leading copper-producing country, Chile, and even surpass it in terms of copper production. In the northwest and southwest, a large number of oil exploration personnel (including geophysics, drilling, geological structure, hydrogeology, stratigraphic paleontology and other professionals) are also advancing confidently on the road to discovering vast oil fields for the motherland. Constant new discoveries have raised the morale of every geologist to such an extent that they all can't wait to report good news to Chairman Mao at all times, and can't wait to make their guarantees to the people of the whole country, expressing that they have the confidence and the strength—especially through their own efforts, the ever-growing new forces cultivated in schools, on site, and in work practice—to complete the glorious task entrusted to them by the people of the motherland.

    (IV)
    Do the facts mentioned above indicate that our geological work today has reached the most perfect level? Of course not, and it can even be said that it is far from perfect. Therefore, we ask every geological worker to continue to advance courageously and pay attention to the following two points:
    First, we ask every geological worker to implement the spirit of the recent geological workers' meeting, actively implement work norms, procedures, and systems, abide by the plan, and strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to each person on schedule. We should emphasize that strict compliance with these work norms, procedures, and systems is a prerequisite for completing the work plan. Without this, we cannot guarantee the completion of the plan, nor can we respond to the ardent expectations of the people of the motherland and complete the tasks entrusted to us. At the same time, we must also point out that in the first year when we started to formulate the work plan, our experience is still insufficient; and there will certainly be many large and small complex problems encountered in the actual implementation of these norms, procedures, and systems. Therefore, we ask every geological worker to use their brains, conduct in-depth research, grasp the central issues, and strive to delve into them in their work, from solving individual difficulties to proposing reasonable improvements. We resolutely oppose the style of relying solely on subjective imagination regardless of work norms, and at the same time oppose the style of mechanically implementing regulations without using one's brain. Only by overcoming these two biases at the same time can we be sure of completing the work plan, and have the hope of overfulfilling the plan.
    Secondly, as mentioned earlier, the planned drilling, trenching, and other costly mountain work to determine the graded mineral reserves must be arranged according to the geological conditions in order to be scientific. In addition, it is absolutely necessary to stipulate the density of geological points in order to determine the workload. But what should be observed at a geological point is obviously an important factor determining the value of the geological point. That is to say, behind the geological points and the work of determining the level of mineral quantity, there are still many general and theoretical problems in various aspects of geology. The solution of these problems not only plays a decisive guiding role for local drilling, trenching and other work, but also can lead geologists to further understand which areas in the country have the potential for discovering more new mineral deposits for the motherland.
    In the past three years, we have basically criticized and overcome the bias of emphasizing theory and not emphasizing practice, and have learned how to go to practice and how to serve economic construction. This is correct and necessary. Precisely because of this, our work has achieved certain results. We must affirm these achievements and consolidate and develop them in our actual work. At the same time, we must also recognize that precisely because of the vigorous development of geological work today, many complex geological problems existing in actual work have been revealed and placed before us, requiring us to study and solve them. This requires us to conduct some necessary theoretical research in our actual work in order to further solve practical problems. If we do not do this, but only satisfy ourselves with the current level of business, ignore the problems that are hidden under the surface phenomena, are happening and will continue to happen in the future, and regard the purposeful research on these problems as not being connected with reality, and do not organize it, then we may very likely fall into shortsightedness, fall into blindness, and fall into the error of "having practice without theory."
    In short, we must firmly remember that the task of our geologists today is first to discover and correctly estimate the large amount of underground resources needed to suit our national construction plan; and secondly, to provide accurate data necessary for all geological engineering designs through field surveys.
    We must also remember that in the practice of completing this task, in order to overcome all the inevitable difficulties and ensure the quality of the work results, we not only need to master the most advanced theories of all departments of geology, but also must constantly summarize our own practical experience, so as to improve the guiding ideology of our work to a higher theoretical level. In this way, we can develop geological science theory from the practice of engaging in production work, and from the improvement of theory, we can further improve production and expand production. There is no doubt that the geological cause and geological science of the new China will advance victoriously along such a broad road, promoting each other.

    地质工作者正在为祖国建设奋勇前进
    李四光
    （一）
    解放了的中国人民，在毛主席和中国共产党正确领导下，三年来胜利地完成了各项准备工作。现在，历史性的第一个五年计划已经开始了，祖国从今要走上我们渴望已久的大规模工业建设的道路了。
    工业建设的自然条件，主要有两大项：一、动力，二、原料。
    过去，在以封建主义生产关系占优势的农业社会里，自然动力的利用是极有限的，利用方式也是极不经济的。今后我们要大规模发展生产，就必须考虑到应如何用最合理、最经济的办法来使用这些动力资源——煤炭、石油（包括天然瓦斯）和水力。
    煤炭和石油都是地下的宝藏。它保存在不同深度的地层里，不是一下子容易发现的。因此，在我们制订计划去大规模开采这些宝藏以前，首先必须了解它们在地下存在的情况——它们在地下是如何分布的，产生于哪些地质时代，哪些地层之中。我们也必须了解：在不同的古地理环境和古气候条件下所造成的煤炭和石油，是和哪一类地层、哪一类型的地区（例如山间盆地、山脉前沿凹地、古湖沼、古海湾或古内陆浅海等）有最密切的联系。我们也必须了解：哪一种地质构造最适宜于保存它们。这些工作，就是要地质工作者来做的。
    水力发电，是把水力变成电力，这是一系列的复杂工作。其中一部分主要工作，包括水源流域的一般地形和地质情况，当地河流侵蚀的规律，某些重要基地的岩石性质和结构的调查和研究，特别是水库坝址的选定，显然，这也是地质工作者的任务。
    除了上述三种动力来源之外，另一种很重要的动力来源是放射物质，特别是铀和钍。它们形成各种矿物，分布在各种不同的岩石里。近代物理学早已发见了这一重大的事实，即大量的动力可以从这些物质中解放出来。美帝国主义者一直在妄想独霸这种能量的来源，把它制成大量屠杀人民的武器，例如什么原子弹等；而在我们以苏联为首的和平阵营中，却必须利用，而且事实上已在设法利用这种力量来从事和平建设，为和平工业服务。苏联在改造自然的巨大工程中在利用这种能力方面已有伟大的成就。在我国，某些煤炭等动力比较缺乏的地区，从放射性矿产中取得动力的来源，今后是不容忽视的。
    如所周知，工业建设，尤其是重工业建设，所需要的原料，绝大部分是从地下资源中取得的。其中特别重要的，包括各种黑色金属，如铁、锰、铬；各种有色金属，如铜、铅、锌、锡、钨以及各种普通合金原料，如镍、钴、鉏、锑、铋、镉等；各种贵重金属原料，如铂、铱、汞等；各种稀有元素，如铈、锆、?、钽、锗、锇、钇等；各种铝矿，如铝土矿、矾铝矿等。其次，有各种耐火材料，包括菱镁矿、矽砖、白云石、石棉、耐火泥、和若干种高温催化矿物如矽线石等。再其次，还有作为电工材料的石墨、云母、水晶等；作为化工原料和肥料的硫磺、硼砂、重晶石、硝石、钾盐、磷灰石、石膏、石灰岩、泥质矿物和岩石等；作为催化剂的膨润泥、?土、矽藻和某些稀有元素等。其他原料尚多，在此不一一列举。发现这些原料，提供开采它们的可能性，以保证这些工业原料的供应，也是今天地质工作者主要任务之一。
    除了上述两方面工作之外，地质工作者还必需供给许多工程设计以有关的基本资料，作为施工设计的根据，其中包括基本建设中大型建筑、厂房、港口、机场、隧道、桥梁等地基的基本资料，前面所提到的水库坝址也是其中的一种。这些，都是工程地质方面的问题。为要了解地基的性质和构造，它的抗压和抵抗侵蚀的力量，我们必须从岩矿方面、构造地质学方面，乃至地质力学方面所得到的知识，结合着对岩石性质和水文地质的研究来进行。在石灰岩地区，对这些问题，尤须特别注意。
    （二）
    三年来，全国地质工作者，热烈地响应了毛主席和中央人民政府的号召，从工作实践中，进行了自我教育，改造了过去学院式的研究作风，激起了为人民、为祖国服务的高度爱国热忱，因而在工作上取得了一定的成绩。同时，先进的苏联科学技术应用于地质工作方面的光辉成就，以及通过苏联专家所表现出来的苏联人民底伟大的国际主义精神深深地感动了我们，因而我们又掀起了更进一步响应毛主席的号召、要求学习苏联的高潮。在这样一个基础上，中央人民政府地质部在一九五三年初在北京召开了全国地质工作人员会议。这一次会议，一方面使我们地质工作者更确切地认识了祖国交给我们的巨大任务底伟大意义；另一方面热情地研习了苏联地质工作先进经验，制订了各种工作规范，使我们的工作得以标准化，从而加强了工作信心。这样，也就使我们地质工作人员在工作态度上起了基本的变化：结束了过去自由散漫的作风，第一次制定了适合于祖国重工业建设要求的地质工作计划。同时，各种工作规范和操作规程的制定，又使本年度计划的完成得到了保证。当然，我们不能说：这些计划和规程已经是十全十美了；但是我们深信：从无到有，就是向前迈了一大步。
    今天，我们如果再回顾一下我们以前的工作方式，我们至少可以有下列几点体会：
    一、过去野外地质工作，单凭天然露头来推测，在地表能看到多少算多少；即使有时得到钻探工作的配合，但也是受着资本主义社会影响的限制，不愿多投资，因而大部分还是靠地质人员来猜测。这样所得来的资料，显然是很有限的、甚至在某些情况下是不大可靠的。但是今天我们却可以运用系统的排钻布置和大规模的剥土工作，因此，我们就能够根据更确实的地质资料来精密估定地下矿藏的情况。
    二、在工作方法上，我们获得最大进步的是工作标准化和计划化。我们知道，为了保证某一重工业建设计划的实现，必须保证这一计划中所需要的各种原料产量在若干年内的供给。要保证原料产量的供给，必须首先保证提出该原料的精确储量数字。苏联先进经验告诉我们：为了确定工业建设所需要的矿产储量，依其估计的精确度分为甲1、甲2、乙、丙1、丙2五级。在具体进行某一项工业设计时，规定必须获得各种原料哪一级的矿量是多少。地质工作就根据上述的要求，同时根据矿区的地质条件，来布置一定量的钻探、槽探和其它山地工作。
    我们知道：根据勘测矿产及其他地质情况的实际需要，必须测制适当比例尺的地质图。苏联先进经验又告诉我们：为了保证某种比例尺地质图所要求的精确度，必须规定在一定面积内（如一平方公里）建立多少观测点——这种观测点就叫地质点。根据这些规定，我们就可以算出：为完成多少面积的某种比例尺的地质图并要求作到怎样的精确度，必须配备多少各级地质、测量、槽探……等技术干部和行政干部、花多少时间和需要多少器材和经费。
    假如没有地质点和矿量分级的两项基本概念作为基础，我们就不可能预先对我们的工作作定量、定质、定员、定时、定料的估计，也就不可能作任何计划的设计，更无从打算我们需要培养多少各级各门技术干部。
    三、站在为国家建设事业服务的立场。我们大多数的地质工作者已经有了觉悟，我们不仅政治认识不够，一般思想学习不够，而且深深的体会到过去工作的态度，大都不够严肃，我们过去很多工作的科学价值，不是没有问题的。在联系实际方面最显著的缺点就是：大家都漠视了应有的工程学的知识，对水文地质、地质力学（或土壤力学）以及最近地质时代，即第四纪地质的特殊发展，太不注意。
    四、各种工作规范、操作规程的制定，改变了过去自由散漫的作风，同时又使得各种工作能够有节奏而协调地进行。这样就使得从地质调查工作、钻探工作和其他山地工作直到化验工作能够联合成为一个整体工作来为工业建设服务。
    上述这些，就一贯组织比较严密的某些工矿部分来说，是行之已久的事实；而就地质工作来说，则可说是起了一个大革命。
    （三）
    在今年计划开始执行的第一个季度中，由于苏联专家的帮助，钻探工作、山地工作、化验工作和地质调查工作的适当配合的结果，我们已经取得了一定的成绩。仅仅拿有色金属矿来说：我们最近所发现的潜在储量已经完全打破了帝国主义强加在我们头上的“中国地大而物不博”的荒谬说法。在西南方面，我们又一次发见了有世界地位的广大的铅锌矿区。而“中国是贫铜的国家”的论调，也要被证明是荒谬的了。根据我们现在在全国范围内探勘的结果，我们有坚强的理由相信：不久我们就可以提出充分的资料来证明我们祖国在产铜方面，将要赶上世界上头一个产铜的国家——智利，甚至还要超过它。在西北和西南，大批的石油勘探人员（包括物理测探、钻探、地质构造、水文地质、地层古生物等专业人员）也正满怀信心地向着为祖国发现广大油田的道路上奋勇前进。不断的新的发现使得每一个地质工作人员情绪高涨到如此程度：他们都时时刻刻巴不得向毛主席报喜、巴不得向全国人民提出他们的保证，表示他们有信心、有力量—特别是通过他们自己的努力，在学校、在现场、在工作实践中培养出来并且日益壮大的新生力量—来完成祖国人民交给他们的光荣任务。
    （四）
    上面所举出的这些事实，是不是表示着今天我们的地质工作已经到了最完善的程度呢？当然不是的，甚至可以说，还差得很远。因此，我们要求每一个地质工作人员必须继续奋勇前进，并注意到下列两点：
    首先，我们要求每一个地质人员要贯彻最近的地质工作人员会议的精神，积极执行工作规范、规程和制度，遵守计划，努力按期完成并超额完成各人所担当的任务。我们应当强调指出：严格地遵守这些工作规范、规程和制度，是完成工作计划的先决条件。不这样，我们就无法保证计划的完成，也无法回答祖国人民寄予我们的热望和完成他们交托给我们的任务。同时，我们也要指出：在我们开始制定工作计划的头一年，经验是还不够的；在实际执行这些规范、规程和制度当中，遇到的大大小小的复杂问题一定也将是不少的。因此我们要求每一个地质工作人员，要在工作中开动脑筋、深入研究、抓住中心问题、努力钻研，从解决个别困难到提出合理的改进。我们坚决反对单凭主观想像不顾工作规范的作风，同时也反对机械地执行规定不用脑筋的作风。只有同时克服这两种偏向，我们才能有把握完成工作计划，并且有希望超额完成计划。
    其次，前面已经说过，为了要确定分级的矿产储量而计划的钻探、槽探及其它耗费甚大的山地工作，必须根据地质条件来布置，才是科学的。另外为了确定工作量，规定地质点的密度也是绝对必要的。但是在一个地质点上要观测一些什么东西，很明显，是决定地质点的价值的重要因素。这就是说，在地质点和确定矿量等级的工作后面，还存在着许许多多地质学各方面的一般性和理论性的问题。那些问题的解决，不独对当地钻探、槽探等工作起决定性的指导作用，而且可以导致地质工作者进一步了解：在全国范围内，哪个区域有给祖国发现更多新的矿藏的可能。
    三年来我们已基本上批判了和克服了重视理论而不重实际的偏向，学习了如何走向实际如何为经济建设服务，这是正确而且必要的。正因为这样，我们的工作才取得了一定的成绩。我们必须肯定这些成绩，并在实际工作中巩固和发展起来。同时，我们也必须认识到：正因为今天地质工作的蓬勃发展，实际工作中存在着的许多复杂的地质问题，被揭露出来，摆在我们面前，要我们去研究、去解决。这就要求我们在实际工作上进行一些必要的、为进一步解决实际问题而进行的理论研究。如果我们不这样，而只满足于现在的业务水平，忽视了隐藏在表面现象下面，正在发生着而且将来更不断发生的问题，把有目的地对这些问题的研究看作不是联系实际，不去加以组织，那我们就很可能陷入短视、陷入盲目、陷入“有实际没有理论”的错误。
    总之，我们必须牢牢地记着，我们地质工作者今天的任务，首先是发掘并且正确地估计为了适合我们国家的建设计划所需要的大量地下资源；其次是通过实地勘测，提供一切涉及地质的工程设计所必需的精确资料。
    我们也必须记着，在完成这一任务的实践过程中，为了克服一切必然出现的困难，保证工作成果的质量，我们不但需要掌握地质学各部门最先进的理论，而且还必须经常总结自己的实际经验，从而把指导我们工作的主导思想，提高到更高的理论水平。这样，我们就可以从从事生产工作的实践中发展地质科学理论，从理论的提高，又可以更进一步改善生产，扩大生产。新中国的地质事业和地质科学，毫无疑问，将要沿着这样一条广阔的道路，相互推动胜利地前进。
