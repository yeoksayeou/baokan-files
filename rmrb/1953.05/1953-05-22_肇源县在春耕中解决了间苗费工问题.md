Zhaoyuan County Solves the Problem of Labor-Intensive Thinning in Spring Planting

    Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, solved the problem of labor-intensive thinning during spring planting.

    A major problem encountered by Zhaoyuan County in promoting new cultivation methods this spring was the issue raised by farmers: “Thinning is too labor-intensive” and “There is not enough female labor.” To address this problem, the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee sent a work team to Mengkeli Village, the village with the best implementation of new cultivation methods, in early March to conduct key research and tap into production potential. The work team, together with the masses, examined last year's production methods and labor organization and discovered many areas where labor could be saved or division of labor was unscientific. They then came up with three methods to solve the problem of labor-intensive thinning. First, sow evenly during planting. To achieve this, on the one hand, the "dot gourd" (i.e., seeder) was improved; on the other hand, stubble cutting machines were widely used to clean up the stubble; and at the same time, when planting millet, half of the cooked millet seeds (because they will no longer germinate) were mixed in to make the millet seeds "scattered". In this way, it can be guaranteed that the seeds are sown widely and evenly, and thinning will naturally save labor. Second, stagger the order of planting various crops. Previously, millet and sorghum were sown at the same time, so the thinning time was all at the same time. This year, the sowing period was advanced, and millet was planted first, followed by sorghum and soybeans (corn does not need thinning), staggering the growth period of crop seedlings, so there is naturally enough time for thinning. Third, one-time seedling setting. Last year, millet seedlings were thinned two to three times before the seedlings were finally set, averaging twenty workdays per hectare for thinning. If it can be sown evenly, only one thinning is required to achieve basic seedling setting, and only ten workdays per hectare are needed. After this research, the masses in the village eliminated their concerns about "thinning being too labor-intensive" and "insufficient female labor" and greatly strengthened their confidence in fully promoting new cultivation methods. The above three methods have been discussed and enriched at the district and village cadre meeting held in late March and have been widely implemented throughout the county. The farmers of the county are full of confidence and are striving to achieve an average yield of ten shi per hectare (each shi is four hundred and fifty jin, and the average yield per hectare last year was seven shi and five dou).

    肇源县在春耕中解决了间苗费工问题
    黑龙江省肇源县，在春耕生产中解决了间苗费工问题。
    肇源县在今年春耕中推行新耕作法所碰到的一个主要问题是农民提出来的“间苗太费工”“妇女劳动力不够”的问题。肇源县委为了这个问题，曾于三月上旬派工作组到推行新耕作法最好的孟克里村去作重点研究，挖掘生产上的潜在力。工作组和群众一起检查了去年的生产方法和劳动组织，发现了很多可以省工或分工不科学的地方，从而得出三种办法，解决了间苗费工的问题。第一、播种时要播得匀。为了作到这一点，一方面改造了“点葫芦”（即播种器）；一方面普遍采用了割楂子机，拣净了楂子；同时在种谷子时搀上一半煮熟了的谷籽（因为它再不会生芽），使谷籽“散落”。这样，就可以保证播得宽、播得匀，间苗自然就省工。第二、各种作物排开次序播种。以前是谷子、高粱同时播种，因此间苗的时间都赶在一起。今年把播种期提前了，又是先种谷子，再种高粱、大豆（玉米不需间苗），把庄稼幼苗的生长期排开次序，自然就来得及间苗了。第三、一次定苗。去年谷子都间了二次到三次苗才定苗，平均一垧地间苗费了二十个工。如果能播得均匀，只间一次就作到基本定苗，每垧地用十个工就可以了。经过这样研究以后，该村群众消除了“间苗太费工”“妇女劳动力不够”的顾虑，大大加强了全面推行新耕作法的信心。以上三种办法，该县已在三月下旬召开的区村干部会议上加以讨论、充实后，普遍贯彻下去。全县农民正满怀着信心，为争取每垧平均产量达到十石（每石是四百五十斤，去年每垧平均产量为七石五斗）而奋斗。（本报记者方青）
