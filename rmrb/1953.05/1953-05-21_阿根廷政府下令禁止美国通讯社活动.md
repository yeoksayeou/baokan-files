　　Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, May 20th: The Argentine government, due to the anti-Argentine propaganda conducted by American news agencies, has ordered the cessation of their activities within Argentina.

　　The orders issued by the government on the 8th and 12th of May prohibit the American United Press, Associated Press, and International News Service from receiving foreign news and transmitting it to Argentine newspapers. The orders revoke the licenses previously granted to the Associated Press and United Press to use radio receiving stations, and the radio receiving work handled by the Argentine Post Office for the International News Service has also been suspended since May 16th.

　　Argentine President Juan Perón accused these American news agencies of accepting orders from the U.S. State Department and conducting a planned "campaign of spreading lies" against his government. He demanded that Congress give them "the punishment they deserve." Prior to this, many Argentine newspapers had already voluntarily stopped publishing news from American news agencies. Perón's "Democracia" newspaper explicitly referred to the United States as "our enemy."

　　According to Washington sources, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on the 9th that the United States had protested the actions taken by the Argentine government. He said that the measures taken by the Argentine government violated the basic principle of "freedom of the press" advocated by the United States.

    阿根廷政府下令禁止美国通讯社活动
    【新华社二十日讯】布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷政府因美国通讯社进行反阿根廷的宣传，已下令停止它们在阿根廷国内的活动。
    政府在八日和十二日先后发出的命令禁止美国的合众社、美联社和国际新闻社抄收国外消息并拍发给阿根廷各报纸。命令取消了原先准许美联社和合众社使用无线电收报电台的许可证，国际新闻社由阿根廷邮局代办的无线电收报工作也自五月十六日起停止。
    阿根廷总统胡安·庇隆指责这些美国通讯社接受美国国务院的命令，进行一种有计划的“散布谎言运动”反对他的政府，他要求国会给以“应得的处罚”。在这以前，阿根廷许多报纸即已自行停止刊载美国通讯社的消息。庇隆的“民主报”明白地指美国为“我们的敌人”。
    据华盛顿消息，美国国务卿杜勒斯九日在记者招待会上说，美国已就阿根廷政府采取的行动提出抗议。他说阿根廷政府的措施违反美国所主张的“新闻自由”的基本原则。
