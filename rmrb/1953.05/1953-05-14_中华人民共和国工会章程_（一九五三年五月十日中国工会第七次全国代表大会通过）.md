Constitution of the Trade Union of the People's Republic of China
(Adopted by the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on May 10, 1953)

General Principles

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class has waged a long struggle. In this struggle, it established the closest alliance with the peasants and formed a united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism with all patriotic and democratic forces, thereby defeating foreign imperialism and domestic counter-revolution and achieving the great victory of the people's democratic revolution.

China's modern labor movement developed along the road to victory after the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, the political party of the Chinese working class itself, and under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese trade union unites the broad masses of workers around the Chinese Communist Party, becoming a link between the Party and the masses. After the establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship, under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese trade union became a school for the working masses to learn management, a school to learn how to manage the economy, and a school for communism.

The Chinese trade union is: a mass organization of the working class voluntarily formed by manual and mental laborers who rely on wages as all or the main source of their livelihood, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or religious belief.

The People's Republic of China is a state led by the Chinese working class. Therefore, the interests of this country, the common interests of all the people of this country, are also the fundamental interests of the Chinese working class. Therefore, the Chinese trade union should represent the working masses in actively participating in the formulation of laws and regulations related to production, labor, and the material and cultural life of workers, and resolutely support and implement all policies and laws of the People's Government, making itself a strong social pillar of the people's democratic regime.

The most important task of the Chinese trade union during the period of national construction is to strengthen the unity of the working class, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, educate the working masses to consciously abide by state laws and labor discipline, strive to develop production, and continuously improve labor productivity, in order to complete and overfulfill the national production plan, accelerate national industrialization, and gradually transition to a socialist society. The trade union should always care about the living conditions and working conditions of the working masses, and should gradually but actively improve the material and cultural life of the working masses on the basis of developing production.

In state-owned enterprises, workers are the masters of the enterprise, and the trade union has the sacred responsibility of mobilizing and organizing the working masses to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state production plan. In joint state-private enterprises or enterprises that are fixed for processing for the state, the trade union has a major responsibility for doing a good job in production and supervising the execution of contracts. In private enterprises, although workers are still in a position of being exploited, the political rights and legitimate economic interests of workers are guaranteed by state laws and trade union organizations; therefore, in private enterprises, the trade union also has the responsibility to organize and educate the working masses to do a good job in production and supervise capitalists to abide by government laws and regulations. In this way, it is in the fundamental interests of the working class to enable private enterprises to play an active role in the national economy and people's livelihood under the leadership of the state-owned economy.

The Chinese trade union is organized according to the principle of industry on the basis of democratic centralism. It should take collective leadership and persuasive education as its basic working methods. The trade union must care about the interests of the masses, gather the opinions of the masses, develop criticism and self-criticism, and constantly pay attention to the struggle against tendencies such as bureaucratism and commandism that are divorced from the masses, while constantly improving the organization and discipline of the working masses.

The Chinese trade union must constantly conduct internationalist education for the working masses, actively participate in the international workers' movement, fight for the unity and unification of the international workers' movement, and fight to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

    中华人民共和国工会章程
    （一九五三年五月十日中国工会第七次全国代表大会通过）
    总纲
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下进行了长期的斗争，在斗争中和农民建立了最密切的联盟，并与一切爱国民主力量建立了反帝反封建反官僚资本的统一战线，从而战胜了外国帝国主义和国内反革命，取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利。
    中国现代的工人运动，是在中国工人阶级自己的政党——中国共产党产生以后，并在中国共产党的直接领导下，沿着胜利的道路发展起来的。中国工会把广大工人群众团结在中国共产党的周围，成为党与群众联系的引带。在人民民主专政的政权建立以后，中国工会在党的领导下成为工人群众学习管理的学校，学习主持经济的学校，学习共产主义的学校。
    中国工会是：凡以工资收入为自己生活资料之全部或主要来源的体力劳动者和脑力劳动者，不分民族、性别及宗教信仰自愿结合的工人阶级的群众组织。
    中华人民共和国是中国工人阶级领导的国家，因此，这个国家的利益，这个国家全体人民共同的利益，也就是中国工人阶级的根本利益。因此，中国工会应代表工人群众积极地参加制定有关生产、劳动及工人的物质、文化生活等等法令，并坚决地支持和执行人民政府的一切政策法令，使自己成为人民民主政权的坚强的社会支柱。
    中国工会在国家建设时期最重要的任务，就是加强工人阶级的团结，巩固工农联盟，教育工人群众自觉地遵守国家法令和劳动纪律，努力发展生产，不断地提高劳动生产率，为完成与超额完成国家生产计划，加速国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。工会应经常地关心工人群众的生活状况和劳动条件，并应在发展生产的基础上，逐步地、但是积极地改善工人群众的物质生活和文化生活。
    在国营企业中，工人就是企业的主人，工会有动员和组织工人群众保证完成和超额完成国家生产计划的神圣责任。在公私合营或固定为国家加工的企业中，工会对于搞好生产和监督契约的执行，负有重大的责任。在私营企业中，工人虽然仍处于被剥削的地位，但工人的政治权利和正当的经济利益，有国家法令和工会组织的确切保障；因此，在私营企业中，工会也有组织和教育工人群众搞好生产与监督资本家遵守政府法令的责任。这样，使私营企业在国营经济领导下对国计民生起积极作用乃是符合工人阶级的根本利益的。
    中国工会是按照产业原则在民主集中制的基础上组织起来的。它应以集体领导和说服教育为基本的工作方法。工会必须关心群众利益，集中群众意见，展开批评与自我批评，经常注意向脱离群众的官僚主义、命令主义等倾向作斗争，同时不断提高工人群众的组织性和纪律性。
    中国工会必须经常地对工人群众进行国际主义教育，积极地参加国际工人运动，为国际工人运动的团结统一而斗争，为保卫远东和世界的持久和平而斗争。
