Xinhua News Agency report:

Since mid-April, Zhejiang Province has generally lacked rainfall, and various places have successively experienced drought conditions. The Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry has issued a notice on urgently mobilizing to carry out drought prevention and resistance, requiring leadership at all levels to treat drought prevention and resistance as an important task of current production. The Ningbo Special District established a drought prevention and resistance command headquarters. The Chinese Communist Party’s Yin County Committee transferred forty-eight cadres from government offices to form seven work groups, which went to districts and townships with severe drought conditions to lead drought resistance efforts. Yuyao County promptly convened a meeting of all key gate and dam managers in the county to study maintenance and management work, determining to adopt the policy of storing water before drought and draining water before floods to prevent water and drought disasters in the future. In many areas, farmers, under the leadership of cadres, have eliminated complacency and the mentality of waiting, and are actively drawing water to irrigate their fields. In Jiangkou and other three townships in Fenghua County, farmers built dams in the major rivers to divert river water into the fields for irrigation, enabling more than 4,900 mu of water-deficient fields to be cultivated. In Qijia Township, Haiyan County, over three days, more than seven hundred men and women farmers used waterwheels to irrigate their fields, enabling more than 1,700 mu of green manure fields to be plowed and transplanted in a timely manner. Most areas of Zhejiang Province are prone to both drought and flooding, so various locations are paying attention to preventing floods while preventing and resisting drought.

    浙江各地领导农民防旱抗旱
    浙江省从四月中旬以来普遍缺雨，各地先后呈现旱象。省人民政府农林厅为此曾发出关于紧急动员起来开展防旱抗旱的通知，要求各级领导机关把防旱抗旱作为当前生产的重要任务。宁波专区成立了防旱抗旱指挥部。中共鄞县委员会抽调机关干部四十八人组成七个工作组，分别到旱情较严重的区乡领导抗旱。余姚县及时召开全县主要闸坝管理员会议，研究养护管理工作，确定今后采取未旱先蓄、未洪先排的方针，预防水、旱灾害。许多地区农民在干部的领导下消除了麻痹等待思想，积极引水灌田。奉化县江口等三个乡农民在大河中筑了拦水坝，把河水拦入灌田，使四千九百多亩缺水田有水耕种。海盐县齐家乡三天中有七百多男女农民戽水灌田，使一千七百多亩绿肥田及时耕转插秧。浙江省大部地区易旱易涝，因此各地在防旱抗旱中同时注意预防洪水。
