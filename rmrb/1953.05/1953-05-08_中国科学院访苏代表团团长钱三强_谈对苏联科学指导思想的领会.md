Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th. Qian Sanqiang, head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union, spoke to our reporter about his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union.

Qian Sanqiang said: The delegation, under the warm hospitality of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, has visited many scientific research institutions and some specialized schools, factories, and mines in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and Stalino from the beginning of March until now. The delegation visited the Soviet Academy of Sciences and its various research institutes, and studied the advanced achievements and experiences of Soviet science in various fields. It also introduced the current situation of natural sciences and social sciences in our country to the Soviet scientific community. These exchanges in academic thought will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the friendship between Chinese and Soviet scientific workers and will help the development of the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Qian Sanqiang recalled the feelings of the Soviet people he had encountered in the Soviet Union and said: This kind of friendship is unforgettable. The delegation arrived in Moscow on the day of Comrade Stalin's death. At that time, the representatives were all very sad, and they also understood the sorrowful mood of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, so they suggested whether the visit plan could be postponed. However, the responsible comrades of the Soviet Academy of Sciences resolutely organized the delegation's visit according to the original schedule. They said: We must turn grief into strength, and Comrade Stalin's legacy is to help the Chinese people build their motherland as soon as possible. They first introduced to the representatives the organizational development of Soviet science and the basic situation such as the planned nature of science and the service of science to communist construction. Then they guided the delegation to visit various departments of the Academy of Sciences, research institutes, factories, universities, and museums in various places, so that the representatives could understand the general principles of Soviet science from concrete visits. Then they made a summary report to the delegation in Moscow. During the visit, Soviet scientific workers told us their experiences wholeheartedly, patiently explained the questions raised, and when they knew that a certain experience was useful to China, they were very happy and expressed unlimited confidence in the development prospects of Chinese science. This spirit of sincerity encouraged everyone in the delegation and guaranteed the success of this visit.

Qian Sanqiang then talked about the guiding ideology of Soviet science that he had learned during this visit. He said: The first deep impression is that Soviet scientific theory and practice are closely integrated. This combination is very natural. It can be said that the Soviet Union uses the highest level of scientific and technological theory to solve the most common problems that are most closely related to the needs of the country and the needs of the people's lives. Two things in communist construction projects can prove this. When building dams and reservoirs, it is necessary to find ways to prevent river water from leaking through the sand. In a mathematical research institute, we saw them calculate the flow of water through sand in various situations, and calculate the pressure of water flow on reinforced concrete dams. These calculations are very complicated. However, the research institute came up with many simplified methods, and finally used electrical methods to calculate everything in a short time. Practice in the past year or two has proved that these calculations are in line with the actual situation. This is to use advanced mathematical theory and electrical technology to solve the most common problem of leakage calculation. In an inorganic and general chemical research institute, we saw that they also used advanced scientific theory—the phenomenon of heat release when granular surfaces come into contact with water—to solve the most common problem—under what conditions can sand form agglomerates and reduce water permeability. They used a precise calorimeter that can measure one-thousandth of a degree to find the required size of the sand particles. The results show that mixing appropriate components of local lignite and peat in the sand of the canal and compacting it can form a river embankment with extremely low water permeability.

The second deep impression is that Soviet science is widely and effectively serving production. For example, in the Leningrad Turbine Factory, we saw the manufacture of huge steam turbines and hydraulic turbines. However, the questions of what the shape of the turbine should be and how the turbine will not rust at high temperatures were all solved by scientific researchers and university professors in their laboratories using modern experimental techniques and advanced theories. For example, there is a lot of lean coal in Ukraine, and it is very difficult to use lean coal for combustion and smelting. However, as a result of long-term research by a technical science research institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, it can process lean coal into semi-coke and extract various coal tar by-products. In this way, this research turns unusable minerals into national wealth, and enables high-grade rich coal to be used in more important places.

The third deep impression is that Soviet science is an organic whole. The division of labor in Soviet science departments is not as mechanical as it was in our country in the past. In the Soviet Union, different subjects, such as physics, chemistry, and biology, are used to solve common central problems. Physics, chemistry, biology, etc. are not isolated, but intertwined. Taking the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry visited as an example, there are several physics research laboratories and several chemistry research laboratories. The chemistry research laboratories use many techniques from modern physics. And the people working in the physics research laboratories are all first-class physicists, and their task is to solve the problem of macromolecular structure, regardless of whether they are serving chemistry or physics. Twenty years ago, my country's spectroscopy was quite developed, but due to isolated research, I didn't know how to develop in the next step. After visiting the Institute of Macromolecules, I feel that if my country's spectroscopy is combined with other subjects, it has a broad field of development. Another example is the Pavlov Institute of Physiology that I visited. There are many scientific workers in this institute, including scientific workers in biology, chemistry, and physics. They conduct research around one goal—the problem of higher nervous activity. Almost every job includes research in biology, chemistry, and physics.

The fourth impression is that Soviet scientific research and education are mutually coordinated. In the Soviet Union, no scientist does not believe that education and research must be closely integrated. Because the teaching materials are constantly improved, the theoretical level is constantly improved, and the requirements for combining theory with practice are constantly increasing, teachers must be active scientific researchers. At the same time, scientific research needs more cadres, and the division of labor of research cadres is also becoming more and more specialized, so experienced scientific researchers also serve as teachers. The delegation saw many researchers teaching at universities. For example, Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, leads research work in the Academy of Sciences, and leads chemical research and teaches chemistry at Moscow University.

Qian Sanqiang then talked about the origin of these guiding ideologies of Soviet science. He said: We learned during the visit that the general goal of Soviet science is to further understand and master the laws of nature and society, so that it can more effectively serve the people, serve communist construction, and serve the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the people. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the task of striving for science to occupy the first place in the world. Because only in this way can we best master the laws of nature and the laws of society, so that we can most effectively serve communist construction. This development direction of Soviet science is inseparable from the nature of Soviet socialist society. Qian Sanqiang emphasized: The level of Soviet science has reached the peak of the world's scientific level, and many of its departments are prominently in the first place in the world. This is what the delegation saw with its own eyes. The reason why Soviet science has achieved such great achievements in just over thirty years is because it has received great care from the Soviet Communist Party and government, and because it takes Lenin and Stalin's thought as a guide.

Qian Sanqiang finally said: The delegation deeply rejoices that it had the opportunity to live in the Soviet Union for a period of time, so it was able to more closely appreciate the superiority of Soviet science, and at the same time, it had a deeper understanding of the harm of the bourgeois scientific thought that Chinese scientific workers had been infected with in the past. Bourgeois scientific thought made our scientific workers look at theory and practice, science and production, and research and education in isolation. According to my personal experience, if we want our country's science to truly serve the people, the most basic link is to seriously and practically combine specific businesses to study Marxism-Leninism and eliminate the strong bourgeois scientific thoughts in our scientific workers.

    中国科学院访苏代表团团长钱三强
    谈对苏联科学指导思想的领会
    【新华社莫斯科七日电】中国科学院访苏代表团团长钱三强，对本社记者谈述这次访问苏联的印象。
    钱三强说：代表团在苏联科学院的热烈款待下，从三月初到现在，已访问了莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、斯大林诺的许多科学研究机关和一些专门学校、厂矿。代表团在苏联科学院及其各研究所参观，并学习苏联科学各方面的先进成就和经验，也向苏联科学界介绍我国自然科学和社会科学的近况。这些学术思想方面的交流，无疑地将大大加强中苏两国科学工作者之间的友谊，将有助于中苏两国人民的深厚友谊的发展。
    钱三强回忆在苏联所接触到的苏联人民的情谊说：这种情谊是难忘的。代表团在斯大林同志逝世的那一天抵达莫斯科。当时代表们心里都非常难过，也了解苏联科学院方面的沉痛心情，因此便提出访问计划是否可以推后的意见。但是苏联科学院负责同志坚决地按照原定日程组织代表团的访问。他们说：我们要化悲痛为力量，而且斯大林同志的遗训就是要帮助中国人民尽快建设自己的祖国。他们先向代表们介绍了苏联科学的组织发展和科学的计划性、科学为共产主义建设服务等基本情况，接着引导代表团访问了科学院的各个部门、各地的研究所、工厂、大学、博物馆，使代表们从具体参观中领会苏联科学的总原则，然后又在莫斯科给代表团作了总结性的报告。在访问中，苏联科学工作者把经验倾心告诉我们，对提出的问题耐心加以解释，当他们知道某一经验对中国有用处时，他们感到非常高兴，对中国科学的发展前途表示了无限的信心。这种至诚相待的精神，鼓舞了代表团的每个人，保证了代表团这次访问的收获。
    钱三强接着谈到他在这次访问中所领会的苏联科学的指导思想。他说：第一个深刻的印象是：苏联科学理论和实际是密切结合着的。这种结合非常自然。可以这样说：苏联是用最高级的科学技术理论，来解决与国家需要关系最密切，与人民生活需要关系最大的最普通的问题。可以拿共产主义建设工程中的两件事来证明。在修筑堤坝和水库时，要设法防止河水穿过泥沙漏掉。在一个数学研究所里，我们看到他们计算在各种不同情况下水透过泥沙的流量，计算钢筋混凝土堤坝所承受的水流的压力。这些计算都是非常复杂的。但研究所想出了许多简化的办法，最后用电学办法在简短时间内把一切都计算出来了。一两年来的实践证明，这些计算是符合实际情况的。这就是以高级的数学理论和电学技术来解决最普通的漏水计算问题。在一个无机与普通化学研究所里，我们看到他们也运用高级科学理论——颗粒表面和水接触时放热的现象，来解决最普通的问题——泥沙在什么条件下可以结成团块和少透水。他们用可以测定千分之一度的准确保热器来求出所需的泥沙颗粒表面的大小。结果证明，把当地褐炭和泥炭的适当成分混合在运河的泥沙里，加以筑压后，就构成透水量极微的河堤。
    第二个深刻的印象是：苏联科学是广泛和有效地为生产服务的。例如，在列宁格勒透平工厂，我们看到了制造巨型的蒸气透平和水力透平。但是，透平的形状应该怎样、透平在高温之下如何不生锈等问题，都是科学研究工作者和大学教授在他们的实验室里用现代实验技术和高级理论解决了的。又如，在乌克兰有不少贫煤，要利用贫煤作燃烧和冶炼，有很大困难。但是经苏联科学院一个技术科学研究所长期研究的结果，就能把贫煤加工变成半焦煤，并提炼出各种煤焦油副产品。这样，这个研究使难用的矿藏变成国家的财富，而且使高级的富煤能用于更重要的地方。
    第三个深刻的印象是：苏联科学是有机的整体。苏联科学部门的分工不像过去我国那样机械，在苏联，用不同的科门，譬如物理、化学、生物，来解决共同的中心问题。物理、化学、生物等等不是孤立的，而是交错着的。以所参观的高分子化学研究所为例，那里有几个物理研究室和几个化学研究室，化学研究室运用着很多现代物理中的技术。而在物理研究室工作的都是头等物理学家，他们的任务是解决高分子结构问题，不分什么为化学还是为物理服务。二十年前，我国光谱学相当发达，但由于孤立地研究，下一步不知道怎样发展。参观高分子研究所后，我觉得我国光谱学如果和其他科门结合起来，是有广阔的发展园地的。再以所参观的巴夫洛夫生理学研究所为例，这个研究所的科学工作人员很多，生物、化学、物理各方面的科学工作者都有。他们围绕一个目标——高级神经活动问题进行研究。差不多每件工作都包括生物、化学、物理各方面的研究。
    第四个印象是：苏联科学研究工作和教育工作是相互配合的。在苏联，没有一个科学家不认为教育和研究必须紧密结合。由于教材不断改进，理论水平不断提高，结合实际的要求不断增加，教师必须是积极的科学研究者。同时科学研究需要更多的干部，而研究干部的分工也日益专业化，所以有经验的科学研究人员也兼任教师。代表团看到了许多研究员在大学兼课。例如，苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫一面在科学院领导着研究工作，一面在莫斯科大学领导着化学的研究并教授化学。
    钱三强接着谈到了苏联科学这些指导思想的由来。他说：我们在访问中领会到：苏联科学的总目标是要更深一步了解和掌握自然和社会的规律，使它更有效地为人民服务，为共产主义建设服务，为不断增长的人民的物质和文化需要服务。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会提出争取科学占世界第一位的任务。因为只有这样才能最好地掌握自然规律和社会规律，因而才能最有效地为共产主义建设服务。苏联科学这种发展方向是和苏联社会主义社会的性质分不开的。钱三强着重指出：苏联科学水平已达到世界科学水平的高峰，其中许多部门突出地居于世界第一位。这是代表团亲眼见到的。苏联科学所以能够在短短三十多年期间获得了这样巨大的成就，是由于它得到苏联共产党和政府的极大关怀，由于它以列宁、斯大林思想为指针。
    钱三强最后说：代表团深深庆幸有机会在苏联生活了一个时期，所以能够比较亲切地体会到苏联科学的优越性，同时也比较深刻地认识到了中国科学工作者过去所沾染的资产阶级科学思想的害处。资产阶级科学思想使我们科学工作者把理论与实际、科学与生产、研究与教育孤立起来看。据我个人的体会，要使我国科学真正为人民服务，最基本的一环就是必须认真地、切实地结合具体业务来学习马克思列宁主义，清除我们科学工作者身上的浓厚的资产阶级科学思想。
