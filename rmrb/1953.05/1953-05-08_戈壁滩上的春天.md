    Spring on the Gobi Desert
    Yang Shuo
    
    It's late April. If this were Beijing, it would be the best season for flowers to bloom. But on the Gobi Desert, the season is still early. Once you leave Jiayuguan, you see nothing but boundless sand and gravel, with only clumps of camel grass faintly tinged with green. Whirlwinds are everywhere, swirling the yellow sand high into the air, like columns of smoke rising from the ground, spinning and racing across the desert. At the slightest sign of a change in weather, a gust of wind can bring snowflakes swirling through the air. Close to the Gobi Desert on the southwest is the undulating Qilian Mountains, their peaks capped with snow even in the hottest days of summer.

    But no matter how far you go, no matter how desolate the place, you will see the miracles our people have created for the motherland. Right here on the Gobi Desert, at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, our people from all over the country are extracting oil from the ground and building an outstanding "Oil City" in the desert. This is the Yumen Oilfield. If you don't believe it, stand on a high hill at night and look around. The Gobi Desert is dotted with lights far and near, denser than the stars in the sky. To the north, a red glow lights up the horizon, flickering and flashing, the reflection from the oil refinery. Your heart will surely exclaim:
    "What a wonderful place! It doesn't feel like the desert at all!"

    But we are, after all, still in the desert. Every brick, every stone, every drop of oil here is stained with the sweat of our people and contains the lifeblood of our people. We must thank those geological exploration teams. To continue searching for oil for the motherland, they ride camels, carrying yurts and dry rations, venturing far into the desolate desert, going for days without seeing another person. Only the desert gazelles and the wild horses of the mountains sometimes meet them in startled encounters. I saw such a team, living in a dilapidated lama temple. They were mostly young male and female students, not long out of school. Among them were several female comrades, cheerful and talkative, all from the Jiangnan region. The young Captain Deng told me that when they first left Shanghai for the Northwest, the female comrades were afraid of lice and dirt. Sometimes they disliked the food and preferred to go hungry rather than eat it. The harsh winds cracked their faces and their hands. The altitude here is also high, the air thin, and even a little movement can leave you breathless. But a passion for the motherland made them forget everything. They also worried, worried about their work. If the day's exploration results were poor, you could see them returning from the field without a word. But as soon as they had a bit of success, they would grab the results and show them to everyone, laughing with joy.

    It just so happened. As the comrades of the exploration team were taking measurements with their instruments, a Mongolian passing by on a camel would jump down and ask, "Have you found oil yet?" Even in the wilderness, the people show such concern for their labor. They understand this, and they are willing to dedicate their youth to the people's cause. What fine young people!

    We should even more firmly remember the tens of thousands of oil workers. Wherever an oil-bearing structure is discovered, they go there to drill wells. Once, I followed a small team leader named Wang Dengxue far away from the "Oil City," into the Qilian Mountains. The workers had already set up machinery and derricks in the barren mountains, using large drilling rigs to drill oil wells day and night. Each of them wore a shiny aluminum helmet and high-topped leather boots. They looked very heroic.

    I said with a smile, "You look just like soldiers!"

    Wang Dengxue said, "The volunteer soldiers are lying in the snow and ice on the Korean front; what is this compared to that?"

    In fact, the workers' battle against nature is also very arduous. In the twelfth lunar month, the Gobi Desert is swept by wind and snow, and even the stones are cracked by the frost. All night long, the workers must operate the drilling rigs in the open air. It's so cold that if you touch the machine with your hand, your glove will stick to it. Take a break? What break? The volunteer soldiers are fighting on the front lines, and tanks and trucks need gasoline! Besides, we are also building the motherland, who can afford to rest?

    They do not rest, as tenacious and courageous as soldiers in battle. There really are soldiers among the drillers. I met a young man named Cai Guangqing, with a ruddy face and handsome features. I learned that he had participated in the War of Liberation. Now, in his own words, "Wherever Chairman Mao tells us to go, we will go." On the production front, this demobilized soldier fully demonstrated his fighting spirit. He said to me, "We who come from the army, no matter how difficult, are not afraid of the difficulties of combat. We are not afraid of anything, we just have to learn." Upon hearing that I had returned from the Korean front to visit the construction of the motherland, Cai Guangqing grabbed my hand and said, "Tell the comrades when you go back that we will break through the Qilian Mountains and drill through the Gobi Desert, so that oil will flow like a river, to support the front lines and build our motherland!"

    This is not just heroic rhetoric; our people are using this spirit to develop the treasures buried beneath our motherland. Here, they are not only drilling new wells but also repairing abandoned wells. How many good oilfields were destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries! At that time, the enemy only knew that they wanted oil and drilled wells haphazardly. The oil would suddenly gush out of the ground, for weeks on end, damaging the oil layer and abandoning the well. All of this is the property of the motherland; how can anyone abandon it? Old worker Liu Gongyuan is an expert in well repair. As he was repairing, mud spewed out of the well, onto his hands and face, scalding hot. His skin was burned. Liu Gongyuan is a slow man on the surface, but he's clever. Based on his experience, he understood that this was mud spraying from the pressure of gas trapped underground, not from the oil layer. Let it spray, he thought. After the spraying stopped, he continued to direct the well repair with his burns. One well, two wells… abandoned wells were revived, and oil gushed from the ground like a fountain.

    Oil—it takes so much labor from our people to extract it from the ground, refine it into different types of oil, and then transport it to all corners of the motherland. Each drop of oil is a drop of sweat, and every drop of oil is the blood that our motherland needs. I cannot forget one scene. One evening, I was riding in an oil truck on the Northwest Highway. All along the way, I saw oil tankers driving with their lights on, back and forth, day and night, in great haste. This scene was very similar to what I saw on the Korean battlefield at night. The truck driver sitting next to me was a spirited young man, driving the truck roaring ahead. I looked out the window, and the sides of the road were dark and desolate.

    I couldn't help but exclaim, "You're driving so fast!"

    The driver replied loudly, "We're rushing towards a goal."

    I asked again, "Are we going to Zhangye?"

    The driver shook his head and shouted, "No, it's still far away."

    I suddenly remembered that when I got into the truck, there was a diary on the driver's seat. I had picked it up and flipped through it, and I remembered that the first page said something like this: "In order to build a socialist society…" So I leaned over to the driver's ear and shouted with a smile, "Are you rushing towards the goal of socialism?"

    The driver grinned. I looked out the window again and suddenly felt that the sides of the road were no longer a remote border region but were filled with trees, flowers, and people. In fact, spring had quietly come to the Gobi Desert, peeking through the camel grass, reed grass, and red sand willows. But I also saw another kind of spring. This is not an ordinary spring; it is the brilliant and beautiful prospect that our people are creating with their own hands.

    戈壁滩上的春天
    杨朔
    四月底了。要在北京，这时候正是百花盛开的好季节。但在戈壁滩上，节期还早着呢。一出嘉峪关，你望吧，满眼是无边的砂石，遍地只有一丛一丛的骆驼草，略略透出点绿意。四处有的是旋风，一股一股的，把黄沙卷起多高，像是平地冒起的大烟，打着转在沙漠上飞跑。说声变天，一起风，半空就飘起雪花来。紧靠戈壁滩的西南边是起伏不断的祁连山，三伏天，山头也披着白雪。
    可是不管你走的多远，走到多么荒寒的地方，你也会看见我们人民为祖国所创造的奇迹。就在这戈壁滩上，就在这祁连山下，我们来自祖国各地的人民从地下钻出石油，在沙漠上建设起一座出色的“石油城”。这就是玉门油矿。不信，你黑夜站到个高岗上，张眼一望，戈壁滩上远远近近全是电灯，比天上的星星都密。北面天边亮起一片红光，忽闪忽闪的，是炼油厂在炼油了。你心里定会赞叹说：
    “多好的地方啊！那像是在沙漠上呢？”
    但我们究竟还是在沙漠上。这里的每块砖，每块石头，每滴石油，都沾着我们人民的汗，都藏着我们人民的生命。我们不能不感谢那些地质勘探队。他们为了继续替祖国寻找石油，骑着骆驼，带着蒙古包和干粮，远远地深入到荒凉的大漠里去，多少天见不到个人。只有沙漠上的黄羊，山里的野马，有时惊惊惶惶跟他们打个照面。我见过这样一队人，住在座破喇嘛庙里。他们多半是男女青年学生，离开学校门还不久。当中有几个女同志，爱说爱笑，都是江南人。姓邓的年青队长告诉我说，刚离开上海到西北时，女同志都怕虱子，又怕脏。有时嫌饭不干净，宁肯饿一顿，也不吃。罡风吹裂了她们的脸，她们的手。这儿地势又高，空气薄，动一动，就会闷得透不过气来。一种爱祖国的热情却使她们什么都忘了。她们也愁，愁的是工作。那一天勘探成绩不好，你看吧，从野外回来时，一点声音都没有。只要稍微有点成绩，就该拿着成绩到处给人看，笑翻天了。
    碰巧有这样事。勘探队的同志正拿着仪器测量地形，一个骑骆驼路过的蒙古人会跳下来问：“你们照出油来没有？”就是在荒漠上，人民对他们的劳力也显得多么关心。他们明白这点，他们情愿把自己的青春献给人民的事业。多好的年青人啊。
    我们更该牢记着那成千成万的石油工人。那儿发现了石油构造，他们就到那儿去打井钻探。有一回，我随一个叫王登学的小队长远离开那座“石油城”，走进祁连山里。工人们早在荒山里装起机器，架好钻台，正用大钻机日夜不停地打油井。每人都戴着顶闪亮的铝盔，穿着高统牛皮靴子。样子很英武。
    我笑着说：“你们这不像战士一样了？”
    王登学说：“人家志愿军在朝鲜前线卧冰卧雪的，咱这算什么？”
    其实工人们对自然界的战斗也是很艰苦的。腊月天，戈壁滩上飘风扬雪的，石头都冻迸了。通宿通夜，工人们也要在露天地里操纵着钻机。天太冷，用手一摸机器，手套都会沾上了。休息一下吧。还休息呢？志愿军在前方打仗，坦克，汽车，那样不得汽油？再说咱也是建设祖国嘛，谁顾得上休息？
    他们就不休息，就像战士作战一样顽强勇敢。钻工当中也真有战士呢。我见到一个青年，叫蔡广庆，脸红红的，眉眼很俊，一问，才知道他参加过解放战争。现在，用他自己的话来说：“毛主席叫咱到那，咱就到那。”在生产战线上，这个转业军人十足显出了他的战斗精神。他对我说：“咱部队下来的，再困难，也没有战斗困难。什么都不怕，学就行。”一听说我是从朝鲜前线回来参观祖国建设的，蔡广庆一把抓住我的手说：“你回去告诉同志们吧，我们要把祁连山打通，戈壁滩打透，叫石油像河一样流，来支援前线，来建设我们的祖国！”
    这不只是英雄的豪语，我们的人民正是用这种精神来开发祖国地下的宝藏。这里不但打新井，还修复废井。有多少好油田，叫国民党反动政府给毁坏了。当时敌人只知道要油，乱打井。油忽然会从地里喷出来，一直喷几个星期，油层破坏了，井也废了。都是祖国的财产，谁能丢了不管？老工人刘公元便是修井的能手。修着修着，泥浆从井里喷出来了。喷到手上，脸上，滚烫滚烫的。皮都烧烂了。刘公元这人表面很迟钝，心眼可灵。凭他的经验，他弄明白这是地里淤气顶的泥浆喷，并不是油层。喷就喷吧，喷过去，他带着烫伤照样指挥修井。一口、两口……废井复活了，油像喷泉似的从地下涌出来了。
    石油——这要经过我们人民多少劳力，从地底下采出来，炼成不同的油类，才能输送到祖国的各个角落去。一滴油一滴汗，每滴油都是我们祖国所需要的血液啊。我不能忘记一段情景。有一天晚间，我坐着油矿运油的汽车奔跑在西北大道上。一路上，只见运油的大卡车都亮着灯。来来往往，白天黑夜不间断，紧张的很。这情景，倒很像朝鲜战场上黑夜所见的。坐在我旁边的汽车司机是个满精干的小伙子，开着车呜呜地飞跑。我望望车外，公路两旁黑茫茫的，显得很荒远。
    我不禁大声说：“开的好快呀！”
    司机大声应道：“要奔个目标呢。”
    我又问道：“是奔张掖么？”
    司机摇摇头喊：“不是，还远着呢。”
    我忽然记起上车时，司机位子上放着本日记。我曾经拿起那本日记翻了翻，记得第一页上写着这样一句话：“为了建设社会主义社会……”我就俯到司机的耳朵上笑着喊：“你是往社会主义的目标上奔吧？”
    司机嘻着嘴笑了。我又望望车外，一时觉得大路两旁不再是遥远的边塞，好像满是树，满是花，满是人烟。事实上，春天已经透过骆驼草，芨芨草，红沙柳，悄悄来到戈壁滩上了。但我还看见另一种春天。这不是平常的春天，这是我们人民正在动手创造的灿烂的好光景。
