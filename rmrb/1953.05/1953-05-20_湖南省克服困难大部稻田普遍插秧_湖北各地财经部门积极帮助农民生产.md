    [Report from this newspaper] Hunan Province has universally transplanted rice seedlings on over 30 million mu of paddy fields, except for a few mountainous areas in southern and western Hunan.
    This year in Hunan, there have been continuous spring rains, and some areas have experienced seedling rot, which has delayed the transplanting time. In this situation, Party committees and people's governments at all levels in Hunan mobilized all forces, organized the broad masses, and took various remedial measures to overcome various difficulties in transplanting. The CPC Xiangnan District Committee instructed Party committees at all levels under its jurisdiction to mobilize farmers to replant and sow seeds. Yizhang, Jianghua, and other counties also sent work teams to the countryside to provide specific leadership in this work. In Liling County, 15 percent of the seedlings rotted. The county leadership immediately instructed all districts to promote the adjustment of seedlings between households, groups, and villages. It also mobilized farmers to voluntarily organize temporary transplanting mutual aid groups to improve transplanting efficiency and solve the problem of labor shortages. For example, the second district used to take seven or eight days to transplant rice. Although this year's spring rain delayed the transplanting time by ten days, the entire district completed transplanting in three days due to organization. The seedling rot phenomenon in Hengnan County was relatively serious, with some areas losing more than 80 percent of their rice seeds. The county leadership promptly transferred the remaining 400 million yuan of water conservancy loans into seed loans, which were distributed to seed-deficient households and households with rotten seedlings, quickly solving the problem of seed shortages.
    During the transplanting period, insect pests occurred in many areas of Hunan. The Rural Work Department of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee immediately issued a circular calling on areas where insect pests had been found to seize the opportunity to control insects in the rice fields, quickly eliminate insect pests, and areas where they had not been found to mobilize the masses for a general inspection. Cadres and farmers alike carried out prevention and control work based on local original pest control experience, thereby reducing insect pests and ensuring the smooth growth of seedlings.
    When transplanting rice, farmers in various places consciously reduced drinking "transplanting wine" (插禾酒), saving a lot of grain. (Report from this newspaper's Hunan reporter station)
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th -- Financial and economic departments in various parts of Hubei Province are actively helping farmers to fight drought and produce. The income from local products of farmers in Hubei Province accounts for about one-third of their total income every year. Whether local products have a market or not has a great impact on the economic life of the local people. Last year, some areas suffered disasters and reduced grain production, and this year, some areas of the province are experiencing spring drought; therefore, solving the sales problem of local products so that farmers can smoothly develop production is very important. Under the unified leadership of the CPC committees at all levels, the financial and economic departments of Hubei Province have taken helping farmers to fight drought and production as a combat task since the beginning of spring. The Hubei Provincial Cooperative Bureau issued a notice to cooperative societies at all levels in the province, requiring cooperative societies at all levels to cooperate with other relevant departments to ensure the supply of seeds, agricultural tools, fertilizers, grain, and other materials, vigorously help farmers sell local products, and support farmers' sideline production. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50 small and medium-sized cities and towns in Hubei Province have now held small commodity exchange fairs. With the support of cooperative societies and state-owned commercial departments, more than 80 percent of local products have found a market. At the same time, local People's Banks have also sent cadres to drought-stricken areas to issue large numbers of waterwheel, food grain, and other loans.
    Financial and economic departments in Hubei Province have universally strengthened planning in their work to help farmers fight drought and produce. The financial and economic departments of Wuchang County investigated the shortage of agricultural tools among farmers last year, and based on these circumstances, organized farmers and local handicraftsmen to enter into supply and marketing contracts, helping farmers overcome the difficulties of lacking agricultural tools in production. Cooperative societies in various parts of the Huanggang Special District took the initiative to adopt the methods of pre-purchase and pre-sale in drought-stricken areas, selling rice on credit to grain-deficient farmers and pre-purchasing wheat. This method has been enthusiastically welcomed by farmers in various places and has greatly increased farmers' confidence in fighting drought and production. They said: With the care of the people's government, they are confident in overcoming difficulties. The financial and economic departments of Hanyang, Huangpi, and other counties jointly held special meetings, and according to the specific circumstances of each county and the needs of the farmers, they have divided their responsibilities and prepared various drought-resistant crop seeds for supply to the farmers in a planned manner.

    湖南省克服困难大部稻田普遍插秧
    湖北各地财经部门积极帮助农民生产
    【本报讯】湖南省三千多万亩稻田，除湘南、湘西少数山地外，已普遍插上秧苗。
    湖南今年春雨连绵，某些地区发生了烂秧现象，以致推迟了插秧时间。在这种情况下，湖南各地党委和人民政府动员了一切力量，组织广大群众，采取各种补救办法，克服了插秧中的各项困难。中共湘南区党委指示所属各级党委，发动农民补秧、补种，宜章、江华等县并派出工作组下乡具体领导这一工作。醴陵县秧苗烂了百分之十五，县领导机关立即指示各区，提倡户与户、组与组、乡与乡之间调剂秧苗。并发动农民自愿地组织临时插秧互助组，提高插秧效率，解决缺乏劳动力的困难。如第二区往年插秧要花七、八天时间，今年虽因春雨使插秧时间推迟了十天，但由于组织起来，全区在三天内就全部插上了秧。衡南县烂秧现象较为严重，个别地区损失秧谷达百分之八十以上。该县领导机关及时将剩余的四亿元水利贷款转为种子贷款，发放给缺种户和烂秧户，迅速解决了缺种问题。
    在插秧期间，湖南很多地区发生虫害。中共湖南省委农村工作部立即发出通报，号召已发现虫害的地区，抓紧秧田治虫工作，迅速扑灭虫害，未发现的地区则发动群众进行普遍检查。干部和农民群众都根据了当地原有治虫经验，大力进行了防治工作，因而使虫害减少，秧苗得到顺利成长。
    各地农民在插秧时，自觉地减少了喝“插禾酒”，节省了许多粮食。　（本报湖南记者站）
    【新华社武汉十九日电】湖北省各地财经部门，积极帮助农民抗旱生产。湖北省农民每年的土产收入占总收入的三分之一左右，土产有无销路，对当地人民的经济生活影响很大。去年部分地区遭受灾害，粮食减产，今年全省若干地区又呈现春旱现象；因此，解决土产销路，使农民能顺利发展生产的问题，就十分重要。湖北省各财经部门在中共各级党委统一领导下，入春以来，都把帮助农民抗旱生产作为战斗任务。湖北省合作局曾向全省各级合作社发出通知，要求各级合作社必需协同其他有关部门，保证作好种籽、农具、肥料、粮食等供应工作，大力帮助农民推销土产，支援农民的副业生产。据不完全统计，现在湖北省已有五十多个中小城镇召开了小型物资交流会，在合作社和国营商业部门扶助下，百分之八十以上的土产打开了销路。同时，各地人民银行也派出干部深入受旱区，发放了大批的水车、口粮等贷款。
    湖北省各财经部门在帮助农民抗旱生产的工作中普遍加强了计划性。武昌县财经部门，去年就调查了农民缺少农具的情况，并根据这些情况，组织农民和当地手工业者订立了供销合同，帮助农民克服了生产中缺少农具的困难。黄冈专区各地合作社在受旱区主动地采取了预购、预销办法，把大米赊给缺粮农民，预购小麦。这种方法受到各地农民热烈欢迎，大大提高了农民抗旱生产的信心。他们表示：在人民政府的关怀下，一定有信心战胜困难。汉阳、黄陂等县财经部门，更联合召开了专门会议，根据各该县具体情况和农民的需要，已分工负责，有计划地准备了各种耐旱作物种籽供应农民。
