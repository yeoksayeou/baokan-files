This spring's Huai River harnessing project, which fully commenced in late March, has completed over 55 million cubic meters of earthwork by the end of April after more than a month of intense work, accounting for 71 percent of the planned spring earthwork task. The Chongtong River dredging project was completed before the end of March; the first phase of earthwork for the Nanwan and Boshan reservoirs, the first phase of the Bogang diversion canal project, the Quan River and Meng River depression flood storage projects, the Feifei River diversion project, the tail-end works of the Northern Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal and drainage canals, and the canal head project of the Southern Main Canal's Shaobo-Xiannvmiao section, were all completed in late April and early May; the Ying River, Hong River, Fuyang Prefecture section, and the Bao River, Gang River, and Hei River projects were also completed in mid-May. The Hong River Xinyang Prefecture section also stopped work on May 15th. Currently, more than 800,000 migrant workers have returned to their hometowns to resume production.

Since the start of the spring Huai River harnessing project, the enthusiasm of the migrant workers has been high due to the reasonable increase in earthwork wages and the strengthening of safety and sanitation work on the construction sites. Some areas have enthusiastically launched patriotic labor emulation campaigns, and mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and tricks, and create advanced experiences. For example, on the Meng River depression flood storage project site, the migrant workers of Zou Kunhai's team in Yingshang County created a vegetable garden-style drainage method, and the migrant workers of Zhang Fochu's team in Huoqiu created a four-corner soil pond drainage method, turning difficult-to-dig earthwork into easy-to-dig earthwork; Ye Naishen, a migrant worker in Gushi County on the Hong River construction site, created a continuous splitting method, which doubled work efficiency; the migrant workers of Tu Jihong's team in Xihu Brigade, Huoqiu County, created a four-corner digging method, overcoming the phenomenon of idle work.

At present, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers working in the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River are actively striving to complete the earthwork project task as soon as possible.

    今年春季治淮土方工程现已大部完工
    【本报讯】今年春季治淮工程，从三月下旬全面开工以来，经过一个多月的紧张工作，到四月底止，已完成了五千五百多万立方公尺的土方任务，占春季土方工程计划任务的百分之七十一。漴潼河疏浚工程早在三月底以前就已完工；南湾、薄山两水库的第一期土方工程，泊岗引河的第一期工程，泉河、濛河洼地蓄洪工程，引淝入涡工程，苏北灌溉总渠及排水渠尾工，南干渠邵伯仙女庙段渠首工程，都在四月底、五月上旬先后完工；颍河、洪河、阜阳专区工段及包河、港河、黑河等工程，也在五月中旬全部完工。洪河信阳专区工段也在五月十五日放工。目前已有民工八十余万人复员回乡生产。
    春季治淮工程动工后，由于合理地提高了土方工资和加强了工地的安全、卫生工作，民工劳动情绪高涨，有些地区热烈地开展了爱国劳动竞赛运动，并发动群众想点子，找窍门，创造先进经验。如濛河洼地蓄洪工程工地上，颍上县邹坤海小队民工创造了菜畦式的排水法，霍邱张佛初民工小队创造了土塘四角排水法，将难挖的土方变成了易挖的土方；洪河工地固始县民工叶乃申创造了连环劈土法，提高了工作效率一倍；霍邱县西湖大队屠纪洪小队民工创造了四角挖土法，克服了窝工现象。
    目前，在淮河上中游工作的几十万民工，正在积极努力争取早日完成土方工程任务。
