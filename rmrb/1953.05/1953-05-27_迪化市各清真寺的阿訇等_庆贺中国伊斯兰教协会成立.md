Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, May 25th: Imams, Mullahs, and Imams from various mosques in Dihua City held a forum at the Shaanxi Grand Mosque in Dihua City on the 20th to celebrate the establishment of the China Islamic Association.

At the forum, the Imams, Mullahs, and Imams spoke one after another. With immense joy, they recounted the developments in politics, economics, and culture of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang who believe in Islam over the past three years under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, as well as the respect for freedom of religious belief and customs. The Uyghur Imam Aji said that before liberation, people of all ethnic groups who believed in Islam were subject to persecution and humiliation by the Kuomintang reactionaries at any time. After liberation, they were not only able to freely participate in religious activities, but also had the right to participate in various social activities.

At the forum, the Imams and Mullahs expressed their willingness to further unite around Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, actively participate in production and construction, and strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and strive to defend Far Eastern and world peace.

    【新华社迪化二十五日电】迪化市伊斯兰教各清真寺的阿訇、毛拉、依玛木，二十日在迪化市陕西大寺举行座谈会，庆贺中国伊斯兰教协会的成立。
    座谈会上，各位阿訇、毛拉、依玛木相继发言，他们以无比欢欣的心情，叙述了三年来新疆各地信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，在政治、经济、文化各方面的发展，以及宗教信仰自由、风俗习惯受到尊重的情况。维吾尔族的依玛木阿吉说，解放前，信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，随时都会遭受到国民党反动派的迫害和侮辱。解放后，他们不仅能够自由地参加宗教活动，而且还有参加各种社会活动的权利。
    座谈会上，阿訇、毛拉、依玛木纷纷表示要进一步团结在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的周围，积极参加生产建设和加强抗美援朝斗争，为保卫远东和世界和平而努力。
