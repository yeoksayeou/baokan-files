Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    The Office of the North China Electric Power Administration under the Ministry of Fuel Industry sent a letter stating: The People's Daily "Summary of Letters from Readers" column on April 16th published the criticism from workers at the Tangshan Power Plant regarding our administration's large quantity of equipment becoming scrap. This exposed our past bureaucratic work style of not paying attention to the proper storage of state materials and not valuing opinions from below. The batch of machine parts stored at the Tangshan Power Plant was shipped to Tangshan before the Japanese surrendered. After liberation, our administration handed it over to the Tangshan Power Plant for safekeeping. Because this batch of machine parts had too many missing components, it was impossible to repair them; if they were used as spare parts for repairs, it was felt to be too wasteful. As a result, the proper handling of this batch of machine parts was delayed, and our administration did not properly store them, resulting in significant losses. Currently, the person in charge of our administration has gone to the Tangshan Power Plant to conduct a detailed inspection based on the points raised in the letter, and decided to reinforce and repair the reed mat shed, and build a warehouse at the Tangshan Power Plant to prevent further damage to the equipment. Our administration has also decided to send technical personnel in the near future to appraise this equipment, and the parts that can be utilized will be transferred to various capital construction and production units for use; parts that cannot be used in the short term will be properly stored; parts that cannot be used and have no value for further storage will be disposed of as scrap iron. The exposure of this fact demonstrates the concern and care of the worker comrades for state property and has given us a profound education. It is understood that similar situations exist in Datong and Xiahuayuan and other places, and our administration has also decided to send special personnel to inspect and deal with them.

    华北电业管理局来信检讨不重视保管国家物资的问题
    中央燃料工业部华北电业管理局办公室来信：四月十六日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏载唐山发电厂工人对我处大批器材变成废品的批评，揭发了我们过去对国家器材不注意保管和对来自下面的意见不重视的官僚主义作风。存在唐山发电厂的这批机件系日寇投降前运到唐山的，解放后由我局交唐山发电厂代管。因这批机件缺件过多，无法修复；如果作为零星修补器材，又感到太可惜。结果这批机件拖延下来没作适当处理，我局又没有很好加以保管，以致造成不少损失。现在我处负责人已根据来信所提各点赴唐山发电厂作详细检查，决定将芦席棚加固修理，并在唐山发电厂加建仓库一座，以免器材再受损失。我局并决定于短期内派技术人员对此项器材作一鉴定，将能利用的部分即分别调至各基本建设和生产单位利用；短期不能利用的即妥善保管起来；不能利用又无再保管价值的即作废铁处理。这一事实的揭发说明了工人同志对国家财产的关心和爱护，给了我们深刻的教育。据了解：大同和下花园等处也存在着相类似的情况，我局也决定派专人前去检查处理。
