Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, in order to promote the experience of the Northeast 53rd Factory in factories and mining enterprises in the North China region, held the "53rd Factory Work Experience Report Conference" in Beijing from April 21st to 25th – with Qi Tinghan, chairman of the 53rd Factory Trade Union, giving the report. Participants included 2,700 cadres from state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, and related government departments in Beijing, Tianjin, and provinces and cities in the North China region.

Those who attended the conference were very satisfied after listening to the report, believing that the experience of the 53rd Factory was mature, complete, and comprehensive. They believed that the 53rd Factory creatively embodied the correct work methods of "from the masses, to the masses" and "concentrate, persist" in relying on the working masses to run the people's enterprises well. Under the general goal of doing a good job in production, they correctly resolved the relationship between the Party, government, trade union, and the Communist Youth League. Under the strong and unified leadership of the Party, the Party, government, trade union, and the Communist Youth League achieved consistency in thought, action, and pace. Everyone also believed that the combination of political work and economic work in the 53rd Factory was the most successful. During the meeting, many factories and mining enterprises compared their own work with the experience of the 53rd Factory and conducted self-examinations. Some found that they had not yet solved the problems of relying on the working masses to run the enterprise well and the relationship between the Party, government, trade union, and the Communist Youth League; some found that they had not handled the issue of "doing a good job in production and providing good welfare" well, and so on.

At the end of the meeting, Comrade Liu Xiufeng of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau made a summary report. He called on everyone to first conscientiously study the experience of the 53rd Factory, combine it with the specific conditions of their own units, and practically apply it to their work to improve it. He pointed out that according to past experience, in order to promote the experience of the 53rd Factory well, Party committees at all levels must pay attention to this work and must carry it out under the leadership of the local Party committee in a prepared, planned, and step-by-step manner, otherwise it will not be done well. Liu Xiufeng finally instructed everyone to pay attention to the following points in promoting the experience of the 53rd Factory: (1) It is necessary to prevent conservative thinking and complacency. Obstacles such as thinking that one's own conditions are not as good as those of the 53rd Factory, or feeling that one's own work is already done well, must be overcome. (2) Do not copy mechanically. The main thing is to learn the basic spirit of the experience of the 53rd Factory. One should conduct in-depth investigation and research to see what problems exist in one's own factory and determine what to do first and what to do later. (3) Prevent impatience. Do not think that you can completely do a good job in your factory (mine) all at once. You must proceed step by step in a realistic manner according to your own conditions. (4) The promotion of the experience of the 53rd Factory must be combined with the central work and should not be opposed to the central work. The practice and idea of promoting for the sake of promotion and separating from the central work, or thinking that "work is busy" and there is no time for promotion, are both wrong. In addition, attention should be paid to the possible negative emotions that may arise in the early stages of promotion, such as believing that the experience of the 53rd Factory is good and completely negating one's original achievements, losing confidence, which is also wrong.

    举办五三工厂工作经验报告大会
    【新华社七日讯】中共中央华北局为了在华北区厂矿企业中推广东北五三工厂的经验，四月二十一日到二十五日在北京举办了“五三工厂工作经验报告大会”——由五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉报告。参加听讲的包括北京、天津两市和华北区各省、市国营、地方国营工矿企业及有关机关部门的干部共两千七百人。
    参加这次会议的人，听了报告以后，都感到很满意，认为五三工厂的经验是成熟的，而且是完备的，成套的。他们认为五三工厂创造性地体现了“从群众中来，到群众中去”和“集中起来，坚持下去”依靠工人群众办好人民企业的正确的工作方法。在搞好生产的总目标下，他们正确地解决了党、政、工、团的关系。在党的强有力的统一的领导下，党、政、工、团在思想上、行动上、步调上取得一致。大家并认为五三工厂的政治工作和经济工作相结合的经验是最成功的。会议当中不少厂矿企业单位，以五三工厂的经验对照自己单位的工作作了检查。有的检查出自己单位中在依靠工人群众来办好企业和党、政、工、团的关系等问题上还没有很好解决；有的检查出在“搞好生产，办好福利”的问题上还处理得不好，等等。
    会议结束时，中共中央华北局刘秀峰同志作了总结报告。他号召大家首先认真地学习五三工厂的经验，结合自己单位的具体情况，实际运用到工作中去，使工作提高一步。并指出：根据以往的经验，要把五三工厂的经验推广得好，各级党委必须重视这一工作，必须在当地党委的领导下，有准备、有计划、有步骤地进行，否则，是做不好的。刘秀峰最后指示大家在推广五三工厂经验当中，应注意以下几点：（一）必须防止保守思想和骄傲自满的情绪。如认为自己的条件不及五三工厂的条件好，或觉得自己的工作已经作得不错了，这些思想障碍，必须注意克服。（二）不要生搬硬套。主要是学习五三工厂的经验的基本精神，应深入地调查研究，看看自己厂子里存在着什么问题，确定先做什么后做什么。（三）防止急躁情绪。不要想一下子就把自己厂（矿）子的工作完全做好，必须根据自己的条件实事求是地有步骤地进行推广。（四）推广五三工厂的经验必须和中心工作结合，不应和中心工作对立起来，那种为推广而推广和中心工作脱节或认为“工作忙”没有时间推广的做法和想法都是不对的。此外，在推广的初期要注意可能产生的消极情绪，如认为五三工厂的经验好，就完全否定了自己原来的成绩，失掉了信心，这也是不对的。
