    Happy Soviet Children
    Dubrovinna
    First Deputy Minister of Education
    Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic

    The Soviet state considers caring for children its sacred duty. Children are our future, our bright communist tomorrow. Children are the concrete manifestation of the beautiful hopes and ideals of our people.

    Fatherly care for children can be seen in the earliest decrees signed by the great Lenin. Children have become increasingly happier since the establishment of Soviet power in our country.

    In the Soviet Union, the word "mother" is a source of pride, and the status of Soviet mothers is highly elevated. In our country, fulfilling the responsibilities of a mother is considered a contribution to the state and society. The government awards the honorary title of "Mother Heroine," the "Mother's Glory" Order, and the "Motherhood" Medal to mothers with many children.

    In the Soviet state, everything possible is done to enable women who bear and raise children to engage in productive and social work without harming their own health or the life and health of the children.

    The state provides substantial material assistance to mothers with many children and single mothers. Since the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued the decree in July 1944 to increase state subsidies for pregnant women, mothers with many children, and single mothers, the state had allocated 14,311,600,000 rubles in subsidies to women by May 1945.

    Maternity hospitals, gynecological clinics, free medical care, and care for mothers are all for the health of newborn infants, ensuring they live in affection and care from the first day of their lives.

    Factories, state farms, and collective farms all have nurseries where mothers can voluntarily send their children under the age of three. They can work with peace of mind, go to breastfeed their children at scheduled times, and take them home after work.

    Currently, nurseries across the Soviet Union care for over three million children. Nurseries have well-equipped buildings, and all equipment costs are included in the state budget. Parents pay only a small portion of the living expenses for their children, the amount depending on their income.

    If, according to a doctor's opinion, a child needs to recuperate for several months or even a year, all expenses during the recuperation period are also borne by the state.

    This care from the state for mothers and children has greatly reduced the infant mortality rate and significantly increased the birth rate. The infant mortality rate has decreased by more than one-half compared to 1940. Now, the Soviet population increases by more than three million people each year.

    Our children grow up under the earnest care of their families and the state. When children reach the age of three, kindergartens open their doors to welcome them. In the old Russia, there were very few kindergartens, only 285 in total, with funding mainly from private individuals and charitable organizations. They accommodated fewer than 5,000 children, and the fees were extremely high, making it impossible for the children of working people to attend.

    But now, in the Russian Soviet Federative Republic alone, there are more than 17,000 kindergartens, educating more than 900,000 preschool children.

    During the busy farming season, collective farms and state farms set up summer open-air kindergartens, which can accommodate approximately 900,000 children. Although there are nurseries and kindergartens, this does not diminish the significance of family education. Family education holds a lofty position in the Soviet Union, filled with new and profound meaning, perhaps for the first time in history, because families must work with state educational institutions to jointly complete the sacred task of educating the younger generation in the communist spirit.

    Like nurseries, kindergartens are funded by the state, and parents pay only a small portion of the fees for their children.

    The education of young children in preschool educational institutions is based on genuine scientific foundations. Preschool education is an integral part of the entire system of Soviet pedagogy.

    Kindergartens lay the foundation for children in terms of physical, intellectual, and moral education, which will be further developed in schools. Children live under the constant care of educators and doctors. Their daily routines are strictly regulated according to their age characteristics. Correctly regulating diet, adhering to hygiene requirements, ensuring sleep in fresh air, and taking young children to suburban villas for summer vacations are all fixed rules of every kindergarten.

    When you enter the kindergarten, this happy world of children, and see those lively, joyful, healthy, and well-mannered children; when you see them wholeheartedly playing and loving each other, how pleasant it is! What thoughts and emotions must fill the hearts of every mother when she sees these children!

    When children turn seven, they go to school, and September 1st is the most beloved day for Soviet children.

    Schools eagerly welcome the children who come to study. How many great wonders of science will it tell them! It will patiently guide them from one grade to another, step by step, towards the peak of knowledge. Adults remember their alma mater with a sense of gratitude, because there, they spent a happy childhood and beautiful youth.

    There are now more than 220,000 primary and secondary schools in the Soviet Union. In the post-war years alone, 23,500 new schools have been built, and thousands of new schools are under construction every year.

    According to the law on universal compulsory education, the generation growing up in the Soviet Union must receive school education. "Not a single child left out of school" is a law that must be observed by all the people and the Soviet national education departments.

    In the old Russia, there were few schools, and the Tsarist government was reluctant to spend money on national education. At that time, schools were class-based and stratified. Most schools were closed to the children of working people. Only a few girls were able to attend school, and in the old Russia, most women in remote areas were illiterate. At that time, schools were tools for class enslavement, dedicated to training loyal servants for the bourgeoisie.

    That era has long passed. Now, a total of 57 million people are studying in the Soviet Union, of which 37 million are primary and secondary school students.

    After the victory of the revolution, a completely new type of education system was formed. Schools arm students with extensive and reliable scientific knowledge of nature, society, and thought, cultivate students' Marxist-Leninist worldview, and educate them with a noble communist morality, a vibrant spirit of Soviet patriotism, and the spirit of the ideas and policies of the great Lenin and Stalin Party. To cultivate every student into an active and conscious builder of communist society, that is the purpose of our school education.

    Now, Soviet schools have entered a new and higher stage of development. The historic 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held in Moscow in October 1952, put forward great new tasks in the field of national education. According to the resolutions of the Congress, during this five-year plan, the Soviet Union will implement ten-year universal education in the capitals of various union republics and autonomous republics, in the centers of provinces and regions, and in many other industrial centers. By the sixth five-year plan, the country will complete the transition from seven-year compulsory education to the implementation of universal secondary education.

    The completion of this enormous task requires enormous material strength. There is a need to expand school construction on a larger scale. The number of schools to be established in the fifth five-year plan will increase by 70 percent compared to the fourth five-year plan.

    The number of students enrolled in institutions of higher education will increase by 45 percent compared to the past.

    According to the instructions of the 19th Party Congress, the content of school work has also changed. Now, primary and secondary schools have successively begun to implement comprehensive technical education, starting with the teaching processes of physics, chemistry, biology, geography, mathematics, and drawing. Comprehensive technical education gives students a general understanding of modern production and equips them with the skills needed for future practical work.

    The general scope of comprehensive technical education must be determined in the same way for urban schools or rural schools, whether for co-educational or single-sex schools.

    In this academic year, schools have more widely linked theory with practice. Leaders guide students to conduct more experiments and internships, and visit factories, power stations, collective farms, and state farms. Many schools, with the help of some enterprises, have established various specialized studios.

    In order to accomplish the tasks put forward by the 19th Party Congress, it is necessary to further enhance the role and significance of Soviet general education schools in completing the overall task of communist education of the younger generation, and to enhance the significance of school education.

    The Soviet Union has many scientific research institutions that specialize in studying various teaching methodology issues. This work is led by the Academy of Educational Sciences.

    Soviet children are studying diligently, keeping in mind Lenin's teaching: "Only by enriching your mind with all the treasures of knowledge created by mankind can you become a communist."

    However, the task of educating children in communism is not only undertaken by schools. Since the establishment of Soviet power, our country has widely established various extracurricular children's institutions: more than 1,200 Young Pioneer Palaces and "Young Pioneer Homes," more than 400 Young Technicians' Stations, more than 230 Young Natural Scientists' Stations, more than 400 sports schools, etc.

    Every summer, millions of children travel to the borderlands of the motherland, the vast grasslands, forests, mountains, rivers, and lakes.

    Other cultural and educational institutions, such as theaters, clubs, cultural parks, and cinemas, have shown deep concern for children.

    Theaters perform plays written specifically for children, as well as classical plays and modern Soviet plays that children can understand.

    Soviet children's films have profound ideological content and are an effective means of moral education for young audiences.

    Trade union organizations also provide their clubs, libraries, cultural palaces, parks, and sports fields to children for extracurricular activities.

    The state publishes millions of books and millions of children's newspapers and magazines for children every year. The Russian Soviet Federative Republic alone has established approximately 800 children's reading rooms and children's libraries.

    The Soviet people have shown great concern for the health of students. Protecting the health of students is the task of the state and society.

    All schools have clinics, and are staffed with school doctors and nurses.

    As pointed out in annual surveys, the indicators of children's physical development (height, weight, chest circumference) are very high in classes of all ages.

    In the summer of 1952, more than 6,140 Young Pioneer summer camps were established for students. During the summer vacation, more than 2.5 million students rested there, an increase of approximately 125,000 compared to 1951.

    This summer, 2.75 million students will go to Young Pioneer summer camps to spend their summer vacation.

    The Sanchashan Textile Factory has built a beautiful children's sanatorium on the Black Sea coast for the children of workers.

    The "Artek" Young Pioneer Palace on the southern coast of Crimea is a children's sanatorium with international reputation.

    Our Soviet schools have close ties with various children's and youth communist organizations in the country. The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League leads the children's communist movement. The Young Pioneers, named after the great revolutionary leader Lenin, unites 19 million Soviet children within its organization.

    Last year, the Young Pioneers commemorated its 30th anniversary, and received a congratulatory message from the great Comrade Stalin, which said:

    "On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Leninist Young Pioneers, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all Young Pioneers and students.

    "I wish the Young Pioneers and students good health and new achievements in learning, labor, and social work.

    "The Young Pioneers must cultivate all Young Pioneers and students to become loyal Leninists and loyal sons of our great motherland."

    Schools, the Young Communist League, and the Young Pioneers focus their efforts on providing communist education to children. They educate children with the spirit of heroic labor, heroic conquest of nature, heroic creation of the most perfect social system in the world, with a spirit of hatred for the system of human oppression, and with the spirit of racial and national equality.

    The family plays a significant role in the communist moral education of children.

    The family in socialist society has a truly noble moral foundation. Due to the alignment of goals and the alignment of individual and social interests, true understanding has been achieved between parents and children, making their relationship closer and more harmonious.

    Not only does each family give great care to its own children, but the entire Soviet state is a friendly and loving big family. The Soviet Union pays special attention to orphans who have lost their parents.

    During the difficult war years, the Party cherished children like the most precious property of the people. During the war, countless children became orphans, but the Soviet motherland replaced their families, cherishing them like their own mothers. The people also cared for them like parents.

    Orphans regard "Children's Homes" and nurseries as their own homes. Residents of Moscow, Tashkent, Tbilisi, Yerevan, etc., adopted many children in their homes who had been transported from the front lines, from Leningrad, Stalingrad, from the Baltic coast, Belarus, and various cities in Ukraine. People from all walks of life—workers, collective farm members, educators, actors, doctors, writers—adopted orphans who had been sent back from the front lines.

    Since the establishment of Soviet power, "Children's Homes" established under its care have spread throughout the country, saving hundreds of thousands of orphans who had lost their parents.

    Alexander Matrosov, the Soviet hero who heroically sacrificed himself in the Great Patriotic War, was cultivated by a "Children's Home." Three Soviet heroes—Bogov, Moiseyev, and Sheritsky—were students of the Barnaul "Children's Home." The music conductor and genius musician Ivanov of the Grand Theater was also a student of a "Children's Home." Many former "Children's Home" students have now been awarded the honorary title of Soviet Hero, some have earned degrees and become great scholars, painters, and musicians. Many of them have received higher education and become experts, engineers, doctors, educators, and so on.

    Soviet children are cultivated in labor, in the ability to overcome difficulties, and in respect for the interests of the state, the interests of comrades, and the interests of the family.

    Soviet children are cultivated in the spirit of great loyalty to the cause of Lenin and Stalin.

    "Fight! Don't be afraid, Stalin is always with us!" These were the final words of Zoya, a Moscow female student and member of the Young Communist League who was hanged by fascist bandits eleven years ago, and was posthumously awarded the title of Soviet Hero.

    The Gold Star Medal of Soviet Hero shines on the chests of Pokryshkin, Kozhedub, Ryabova, and many former Young Pioneers who made great contributions to the motherland in the Great Patriotic War, which shows that they strictly adhered to the Young Pioneer motto: "Always ready! To fight for the cause of Lenin and Stalin!"

    Under the education of the great Stalin in the spirit of love for peace and friendly unity with all nations of the world, the Soviet people are doing their utmost to defend and consolidate peace. The Soviet people's extremely great concern for the happiness of our children and for educating children in the spirit of the immortal teachings of mankind's greatest geniuses, Lenin and Stalin, is the best proof that the Soviet people are doing their utmost to maintain peace and carry out peaceful construction for the happiness of all mankind.

    幸福的苏联儿童
    俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国
    教育部第一副部长  杜伯洛维娜
    苏维埃国家认为关怀儿童是自己神圣的职责。儿童是我们的未来，是我们共产主义灿烂的明天。儿童是我们人民美好的希望和理想的具体表现。
    早在伟大的列宁所签署的最初一些法令中，就可以看到对于儿童的父亲般的关怀。从苏维埃政权在我国建立的最初时期起，儿童就越来越幸福了。
    在苏联，“母亲”这两个字是使人引以自豪的，苏联母亲的地位被提得很高。在我们国家里，认为尽母亲的责任，对于国家、社会是一种功劳。对于多子女的母亲，政府授予“母亲英雄”的光荣称号、“母亲光荣”勋章和“母性”奖章。
    在苏维埃国家里，尽一切可能使得生育和抚养子女的妇女，在不妨害自己健康及儿童的生命和健康的情况下，能够从事生产工作和社会工作。
    国家对于多子女的母亲和单身母亲，给予大量的物质补助。自一九四四年七月，苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布对孕妇、多子女的母亲和单身母亲增加国家补助的法令以来，到一九四五年五月，国家已为妇女拨出了一百四十三亿一千一百六十万卢布的补助金。
    产科医院、妇科询问处、免费医疗及对产妇的关怀照料，这一切都是为了出生婴儿的健康，使他们从出生的第一天起，就生活在爱抚和关怀之中。
    工厂、国营农场和集体农庄到处都设有托儿所，母亲们可在自愿的原则下，把三岁以下的孩子送进去。她们可以安心地工作，在规定的时间去给自己的孩子喂奶，下班后把孩子领回家去。
    现在苏联全国托儿所共抚养着三百多万儿童。托儿所有设备良好的房舍，设备经费全部包括在国家预算之内。父母仅为孩子缴付极小的一部分生活费，其数量由他们的收入多少而定。
    如果根据医生意见，儿童需要疗养几个月，甚至一年，疗养期间一切费用也由国家负担。
    国家对于母亲和儿童这些关怀，使儿童死亡率大大减少，出生率大大提高。儿童死亡率比一九四○年减低了二分之一以上。现在，苏联人口每年要增加三百多万。
    我们的孩子是在家庭和国家的殷切关怀之下成长起来的。孩子到了三岁，幼儿园便打开大门迎接他们。旧俄时代，幼儿园寥寥无几，一共只有二百八十五所，经费来源主要依靠私人和慈善机关。收容的孩子还不到五千个。且费用极高，劳动人民的子弟根本没有进去的可能。
    可是现在，单只俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国，就有一万七千余所幼儿园，教育着九十多万学前的儿童。
    农忙期间，集体农庄和国营农场都设有夏季露天幼儿园，大约可以容纳九十多万儿童。虽然有了托儿所和幼儿园，但是丝毫没有减少家庭教育的意义。家庭教育在苏联有着崇高的地位，家庭教育充满了新的深刻的意义，也许是有史以来第一次，因为家庭要协同国家教育机关，共同完成以共产主义精神教育年青一代的神圣任务。
    和托儿所一样，幼儿园的经费也由国家负担，父母只为孩子缴付一小部分费用。
    幼儿教育机关对于幼儿的教育，是建立在真正的科学基础上的。学前教育学是苏维埃教育学整个体系中不可分割的一部分。
    幼儿园在体育、智育和德育方面给儿童打下了基础，以后在学校中将获得进一步的发展。儿童是生活在教养工作者和医生的经常关怀照料之下的。他们日常的生活制度是按照他们年龄的特点严格规定的。正确地规定饮食，遵守卫生要求，必须在空气新鲜的地方睡眠，夏季带幼儿到市郊别墅中去消夏，这些都是每个幼儿园确定不变的规则。
    当你走进幼儿园这个幸福的儿童世界，看到那些活泼愉快的、健康的、懂礼貌的孩子们的时候；看到他们一心一意地游戏、互相友爱的情景的时候；使人感到多么的愉快啊！每一个母亲看到这些孩子们的时候，内心又该充满一种怎样的思想情感啊！
    孩子们一满七岁，就要上学，每年的九月一日是苏联儿童最喜爱的日子。
    学校是那样殷切地迎接来上学的孩子们。它将要给他们讲多少科学上的伟大的奇迹啊！它将耐心地把他们从一个年级引向另一个年级，一步一步地走向知识的高峰。成年人都带着一种感激的心情，怀念自己的母校，因为在那儿，他们度过了幸福的童年和美丽的青春。
    苏联现在有中、小学校二十二万所以上。仅在战后几年间，就新建了二万三千五百所，每年都要动工建筑数千所的新学校。
    按照普及义务教育的法律，苏联正在成长着的一代都要受学校教育。“不使一个儿童留在校外”，这是全体人民和苏联国民教育部门必须遵守的法律。
    旧俄时代学校很少，沙皇政府舍不得在国民教育上花钱。当时学校是具有阶级性和等级性的。大多数的学校对于劳动人民的子女都关着大门。女孩子只有少数几个能够上学，旧俄时代，边远地区的妇女，大部分都是文盲。当时学校是进行阶级奴役的工具，专为资产阶级培养忠实的奴仆。
    这个时代早已过去了。现在苏联学习的人数共有五千七百万，其中三千七百万是中小学学生。
    革命胜利后，一种完全新型的教育体系形成了。学校以渊博的、可靠的关于自然、社会和思维的科学基础知识来武装学生，培养学生的马克思列宁主义的世界观，以高尚的共产主义道德精神，生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义精神及伟大的列宁斯大林党的思想和政策精神教育他们。把每一个学生都培养成为积极自觉的共产主义社会的建设者，这就是我们学校教育的目的。
    现在苏联学校又进入了一个新的、更高的发展阶段，一九五二年十月在莫斯科召开的具有历史意义的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，对国民教育方面提出了伟大的新任务。根据代表大会的决议，在这个五年计划中，苏联将在各加盟共和国和自治共和国的首都、在省和边区的中心，以及在许多其他的工业中心实行十年制普及教育。到第六个五年计划时，全国将要完成由七年义务教育过渡到实行普及的中等教育。
    这一巨大任务的完成，是需要巨大的物质力量的。需要更加大量地扩充学校建设。第五个五年计划中要设立的学校，比第四个五年计划增加百分之七十。
    高等学校招收的学生要比过去增加百分之四十五。
    根据第十九次党代表大会的指示，学校工作的内容也有了改变。现在中、小学已相继开始实行综合技术教育，首先在物理、化学、生物、地理、数学和绘图等教学过程中实行。综合技术教育使学生对现代生产获得一般的概念，以将来实际工作中所需要的技术来武装他们。
    无论对于城市学校或乡村学校，无论对于男女合校教学或男女分校教学，都同样地要确定综合技术教育的一般范围。
    这一学年中，学校已经更为广泛地使理论和实践相联系了。领导学生进行更多的实验和实习，参观工厂、发电站、集体农庄和国营农场。许多学校在一些企业单位的帮助下，都成立了各种专门的工作室。
    为了完成第十九次党代表大会所提出的任务，必须更进一步地提高苏维埃普通教育学校在完成年青一代的共产主义教育的总的任务中的作用和意义，提高学校教育的意义。
    苏联设有许多科学研究机关，专门研究各种教学法问题。这一工作是由教育科学院领导的。
    苏联儿童都在顽强地用功学习，他们牢记着列宁的遗训：“只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者。”
    但是，以共产主义教育儿童这项任务，并不只由学校来承担。自从建立苏维埃政权以来，我国广泛地成立了各种各样的校外儿童机构：约有一千二百个以上的少先宫和“少先之家”，四百多个少年技术家工作站，二百三十个以上的少年自然科学家工作站，四百多所体育学校等。
    每年夏季都有数百万儿童到祖国的边疆、辽阔的草原、森林、山区、河边和湖上去旅行。
    其他的文化教育机关，像剧场、俱乐部、文化公园、电影院等，都对儿童表现了深切的关怀。
    剧场演出专为孩子们写作的剧本，以及孩子们能看懂的古典剧和苏联现代剧。
    苏联的儿童影片具有深刻的思想内容，是对少年观众进行道德教育的一个有效手段。
    职工会组织还把自己的俱乐部、图书馆、文化宫、公园和运动场供给儿童进行校外活动。
    国家每年都为儿童出版千百万册书籍，千百万份儿童报纸和杂志。仅俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国就设立了约八百个儿童阅览室和儿童图书馆。
    苏联人民对于学生的健康，表现了极大的关怀。保护学生的健康是国家和社会的任务。
    各校都设有医务所，编制上都有校医和护士。
    正如每年调查中所指出的，在各种年龄的班级中，儿童身体发展（身长、体重、胸围）的指标是很高的。
    一九五二年夏季，为学生设立了六千一百四十多所少先夏令营。暑假期间，曾有二百五十多万学生在那里休息，比一九五一年约增加十二万五千名。
    今年夏季，将有二百七十五万学生去少先夏令营消度暑假。
    三山纺织厂在黑海岸为工人子女建立了一所美丽的儿童疗养所。
    克里木南岸的“阿尔迪克”少先宫，是一个享有国际声誉的儿童疗养所。
    我们苏联学校与国内各个儿童的和青年的共产主义组织有着密切的联系。苏联列宁共产主义青年团领导着儿童的共产主义运动。以伟大的革命领袖列宁命名的少先队，在自己组织内团结了一千九百万苏联儿童。
    去年，少先队纪念了它的诞生三十周年，这天收到了伟大的斯大林同志的贺词，贺词上说：
    “当此列宁少先队诞生三十周年之际，谨向全体少先队员及学生致以衷心的祝贺。
    “祝少先队员们及学生们身体健康，并在学习、劳动和社会工作上获得新的成就。
    “少先队要把全体少先队员和学生培养成为忠实的列宁主义者，我们伟大祖国忠实的儿子。”
    学校、共产主义青年团和少先队都把力量集中在对儿童进行共产主义教育上。他们以英勇劳动、英勇征服自然、英勇创造世界上最完美的社会制度的精神，以对于人压迫人的制度的仇恨精神以及种族和民族平等的精神来教育儿童。
    家庭在对儿童的共产主义道德教育中，起着重大的作用。
    社会主义社会中的家庭，具有真正高尚的道德基础。由于目的的一致以及个人利益和社会利益的一致，父母和子女之间达到了真正的了解，使他们的关系更为亲密融洽。
    不仅每个家庭对于自己的孩子给以极大的关怀，整个苏维埃国家就是个友爱的大家庭。苏联对那些没父母的孤儿，是特别注意的。
    在困难的战争年月里，党像爱护人民最宝贵的财产一样地爱护儿童。战时，无数儿童变成了孤儿，但是苏维埃祖国代替了他们的家庭，像自己的母亲一样爱护他们。人民也都像父母般地关怀他们。
    孤儿们把“儿童之家”和保育院当做自己的家。莫斯科居民达石恳特、特碧莉西、叶烈娃娜等在自己家里收养了许多从前线、从列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、从波罗的海沿岸、白俄罗斯、和乌克兰各个城市运送来的儿童。各种职业的人——工人、集体农庄庄员、教育工作者、演员、医生、作家都收养了从前线送回来的孤儿。
    苏维埃政权建立以来，在它的关怀下创立的“儿童之家”密布全国，它拯救了成千上万失去了父母的孤儿。
    英勇地牺牲在卫国战争中的苏联英雄亚历山大·马特洛索夫就是“儿童之家”培养出来的。三位苏联英雄——鲍果夫、莫依谢耶夫、谢里斯基曾是巴尔纳乌里斯基“儿童之家”的学生。大戏院的音乐指挥、天才音乐家伊凡诺夫也曾是“儿童之家”的学生。许多过去曾经是“儿童之家”的学生，现在都获得了苏联英雄的光荣称号，有的得了学位，成为伟大的学者、画家、音乐家，他们之中许多都受过高等教育，成了专家、工程师、医生、教育家等等。
    苏联儿童是在劳动中培养起来的，是在善于克服困难、尊重国家利益、同志利益和家庭利益当中培养起来的。
    苏联儿童是以对列宁、斯大林的事业的伟大忠诚的精神培养起来的。
    “战斗吧！别害怕，斯大林永远和我们在一起！”这是十一年前被法西斯匪徒绞死的莫斯科女学生共产主义青年团员卓娅的临终遗言，后来她被追授以苏联英雄的称号。
    苏联英雄的金星奖章闪烁在鲍克雷史金、阔日杜布、里亚波娃以及许多从前是少先队员们的胸前，他们在伟大的卫国战争中，为祖国建立了伟大的功勋，这说明他们严格地执行了少先队的格言：“时刻准备着！为列宁、斯大林的事业而奋斗！”
    在伟大的斯大林以热爱和平及与全世界各民族友好团结的精神教育下，苏联人民正在竭尽全力为维护和平和巩固和平而斗争。苏联人民对于我国儿童的幸福，对于以人类最伟大的天才列宁、斯大林的不朽学说的精神教育儿童所表现的极其伟大的关怀，就是苏联人民为全人类的幸福而竭力维护和平和进行和平建设的最好明证。
