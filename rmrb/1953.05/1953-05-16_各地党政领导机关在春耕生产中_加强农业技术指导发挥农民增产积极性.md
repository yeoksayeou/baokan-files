Party and government leading organs in various regions strengthen agricultural technical guidance to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for increased production
    During this year's spring plowing, Party and government leading organs in various regions have timely strengthened technical guidance on agricultural production, greatly stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for increased production.

    The northeastern provinces, Zhejiang Province, Sichuan Province, Anyang County in Henan Province, and Junan County in Shandong Province have all organized cadres to study the working experience of Ren Guodong, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Guo Houqi (Zhaoyuan County) Committee, and improved their leadership style and methods. The Chinese Communist Party Zhejiang Provincial Committee organized rural work cadres throughout the province to study Ren Guodong's experience in leading farmers to increase production. After learning, 37 county and district leading cadres in Xiaoshan County went deep into grassroots units to work. While further promoting the new farming methods of "equal distance wide sowing, thinning seedlings to protect seedlings, and applying fertilizer in stages," Guo Houqi (Zhaoyuan County) also implemented the "row-by-row planting" method (sequentially arranging planting according to the characteristics of various crops) to stagger the germination periods of various crops so that they could be thinned separately in cases of labor shortages. In addition, various places also learned from each other's experience in leading production. The work team sent by the Chinese Communist Party Gaiping County Committee of Liaodong Province to Lujiatun Village adopted the "one station, three networks" method of Wu County, Shanxi Province to lead spring plowing, which achieved good results. Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, learned the leadership method of "typical chain demonstration" from Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, enabling the majority of farmers in the county to select more than 148,900 jin of rice seeds using the "salt water selection" method, and all implemented the advanced sowing technique of "sparse sowing of grains."

    In order to summarize and promote agricultural production technology, many places have held special meetings to exchange experiences. In March, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Anhui Provincial People's Government held rice high-yield technology research conferences in several major rice-producing areas, such as Wuhu, Anqing, and Chuxian. After detailed discussions and visits to local farms for practical demonstrations, the county, district, and township cadres in charge of agricultural production, representatives of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and farmer representatives who participated in the research conference generally improved their confidence in increasing production. At the cotton planting technology promotion meetings held successively in various cotton-producing counties of Jiangsu Province in mid-April, in addition to exchanging experiences in increasing cotton production, some agricultural production cooperative directors, mutual aid team leaders, and agricultural labor models also formulated plans to increase the yield per unit area of cotton fields. Changshou County, Sichuan Province, held a county-wide agricultural technology research conference in early March. The conference carefully analyzed, compared, and identified various experiences in increasing production, and under the requirement of combining farmers' production experience with agricultural technology, researched a set of advanced farming methods suitable for local conditions.

    Various places have also adopted different methods to organize cadres and farmers to learn agricultural production technology, and through them, promote it to the broad masses of farmers. Before spring plowing, various places in Fujian Province universally held agricultural production technology training classes, combined with local production experience, promoted advanced agricultural production technology, and played a better role in changing farmers' conservative ideas such as "there is no secret to rice seedling fields, only labor and materials are needed" and "production has reached its peak." The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Technology Guidance Committee has directly and indirectly trained more than 50,000 district, township, and village cadres, agricultural labor models, and farmer activists. According to the needs of farmers, Bujiapeng Township, Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, taught various rice cultivation techniques in agricultural technology training classes in chronological order so that they could be followed after learning.

    The agricultural technology promotion organizations established in various places have played a significant role in promoting spring plowing production. Sichuan Province has established 118 county-level agricultural technology guidance stations (or research stations), forming a wide technical promotion network in rural areas. Through the technical promotion network, various counties adopt the method of "farm demonstration, backbone leading, layer-by-layer transmission, and mutual exchange" to promote farming technology, which not only combines advanced technology with mass experience, but also prevents the tendency of coercion and rigid arrangements. Shaanxi Province currently has 140 agricultural technology guidance stations. Each station implements the method of focusing on demonstration and combining key points with general areas to help farmers improve agricultural technology. The Chengcheng County Agricultural Technology Guidance Station first taught the technology of using chemical fertilizers to cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives, and then they taught it to farmers when supplying chemical fertilizers. Because the farmers learned how to use chemical fertilizers, the wheat seedlings in Chengcheng County this year are growing particularly stronger than last year. Before spring plowing, Fujian Province had established agricultural technology guidance offices or guidance stations in eight special zones and 68 cities and counties. The Chong'an County Agricultural Technology Guidance Station signed "technical improvement bilateral contracts" with mutual aid teams such as Huang Shuicui and Zheng Sibao, using typical demonstration methods to guide local farmers to improve technology, greatly encouraging their enthusiasm for increasing production.

### 各地党政领导机关在春耕生产中  加强农业技术指导发挥农民增产积极性

    各地党政领导机关在春耕生产中
    加强农业技术指导发挥农民增产积极性
    今年春耕中，各地党、政领导机关及时加强对农业生产的技术指导，大大发挥了农民的增产积极性。
    东北各省和浙江省、四川省、河南省安阳县、山东省莒南县都组织干部学习中共郭后旗（肇源县）委员会书记任国栋的工作经验，改进了领导作风和领导方法。中共浙江省委员会组织全省农村工作干部学习了任国栋领导农民增产的经验。萧山县干部学习后，就有三十七个县区领导干部深入基层单位进行工作。郭后旗（肇源县）在进一步推行“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”的新耕作法中，又实行了“排开种”的办法（根据各种作物特性循序排列播种），使各种作物发芽期先后稍稍错开，以便在劳动力不足的情况下分别先后间苗。此外，各地还互相学习了领导生产的经验。中共辽东省盖平县委员会派到卢家屯村的工作组，采用山西省武乡县“一站三网”的方法领导春耕，收到了效果。安徽省宣城县学习江苏省松江县“典型连环示范”的领导方法，使全县大多数农民以“盐水选种”方法选了十四万八千九百多斤稻种，并都实行了“落谷稀”的先进播种技术。
    为了总结和推广农业生产技术，不少地方曾举行专门会议来交流经验。安徽省人民政府农林厅三月间在芜湖、安庆、滁县等几个以产稻为主的专区，分别举办了水稻丰产技术研究会。各专区参加研究会的县、区、乡领导农业生产的干部，农业生产合作社、互助组的代表和农民代表，经过详细讨论和参观当地农场的实习示范，普遍提高了增产的信心。江苏省产棉区各县在四月中旬先后召开的植棉技术推广会议上，除交流了棉花增产经验外，有些农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长、农业劳动模范等还订出了提高棉田单位面积产量的计划。四川省长寿县在三月上旬举行了全县农业技术研究会议。会议把各种增产经验仔细分析、比较和鉴定，在使农民群众的生产经验和农业技术相结合的要求下，研究出一套适合于当地具体情况的先进耕作方法。
    各地还采用不同方式组织干部和农民学习农业生产技术，经过他们向广大农民群众推广。福建省各地在春耕前普遍举办农业生产技术训练班，结合当地生产经验，推广先进农业生产技术，对转变农民的“秧田无法门，只要工和料”和“生产到顶”等保守思想起了较好的作用。浙江省农业技术指导委员会已直接间接训练了区、乡、村干部和农业劳动模范、农民积极分子五万多人。该省寿昌县卜家蓬乡根据农民要求，在农业技术讲习班中把栽培水稻的各项技术顺着季节分次讲授，以便学过后就可以照着做。
    各地建立的农业技术推广组织，在推动春耕生产中发挥了显著的作用。四川省已有一百一十八个县成立了农业技术指导站（或研究站），构成了农村中广泛的技术推广网。各县通过技术推广网，采用“农场示范、骨干带头、层层传授、相互交流”的办法推广耕作技术，不但使先进技术和群众经验相结合，并且防止了强迫命令、生硬布置的偏向。陕西省现有一百四十个农业技术指导站，各站都实行重点示范和点面结合的办法，帮助农民改进农业技术。澄城县农业技术指导站先把使用化学肥料的技术传授给供销合作社干部，再由他们在供应化学肥料时教给农民。由于农民学会了使用化学肥料，澄城县今年的麦苗比去年长得格外健壮。福建省有八个专区和六十八个市、县在春耕前建立了农业技术指导所或指导站。崇安县农业技术指导站和黄水淬、郑四宝等互助组订立“技术改进双边合同”，用典型示范方法指导当地农民改进技术，大大鼓舞了他们增加生产的热情。（新华社）
