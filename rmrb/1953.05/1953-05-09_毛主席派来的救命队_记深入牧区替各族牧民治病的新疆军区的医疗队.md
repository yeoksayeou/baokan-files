    "The Lifesaving Team Sent by Chairman Mao"
    – A Record of the Xinjiang Military Region Medical Team Treating People of All Ethnic Groups in Pastoral Areas

    People never forget the grace of saving lives.
    Dozens of silk banners presented to the Xinjiang Military Region Medical Team by people of Kazakh, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups in the pastoral areas of nine counties in Xinjiang Province, including Tacheng, Xinyuan, Hejing, Tuoli, Emin, Gongliu, and Tekes, are inscribed in their respective languages with their heartfelt feelings: You are truly the lifesaving team sent by Chairman Mao; we will forever remember you!
    The entire staff of this medical team, led by Captain Bao Deshi, worked day and night in the pastoral areas of Xinjiang from May to November 1952. Whenever they heard of patients anywhere, no matter how far the journey, whether in the deep mountains or on the grasslands, and regardless of wind or rain, everyone eagerly volunteered to go on duty. Their slogan was: "Wherever there are patients, we will go!" They traveled all over the foothills of the Altai Mountains and every grassland along the Ili River, giving initial diagnoses to a total of 63,018 patients with syphilis, rheumatism, gastrointestinal diseases, skin diseases, etc., and providing follow-up examinations to 41,269 people. The cure rate was 59.7%, and the condition of 20.5% of the patients was alleviated. They also examined the physical health of 10,026 students in various counties, vaccinated 4,693 people against smallpox, injected 16,905 people with various preventive vaccines, delivered 100 babies, examined the stool of 429 people, and performed blood smear tests on 864 people.
    The comrades of the medical team cared for patients as if they were their own relatives, providing meticulous care. Seriously ill and impoverished patients were invited to stay in the tents they brought, and they provided quilts and cotton clothes for the patients to wear; nurses took turns caring for them day and night, feeding them food and water. In Tuoli County, a patient with appendicitis was treated surgically by the medical staff, who then kindly kept him for recuperation, draining his urine, giving him enemas, and feeding him meals day and night for two full days. In Hejing County, a herdsman named Ahe was seriously ill, and the comrades carried him from a great distance to the medical team's residence for careful diagnosis and treatment. After Ahe's condition turned from critical to stable, they carried him back home.
    In order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient medicines and equipment, everyone, with the confidence that "no difficulty can stop the People's Liberation Army," put forward the slogan "Find medicine in the deep mountains when there is no medicine, and use our brains to create equipment when there is no equipment," and they encouraged themselves with the heroic deeds of the volunteer soldiers and commanders on the Korean front. No one bowed their heads in the face of difficulties. For example, when making sodium sulfate, the comrades ran hundreds of miles back and forth to collect niter soil, and it took several attempts to succeed. In the deep mountains and dense forests where they collected medicinal herbs, the comrades often endured hunger and cold, sleeping in the open on the Gobi Desert and under pine trees. Among the medicinal materials collected were dozens of kinds, including rhubarb, ophiopogon japonicus, asafoetida, codonopsis, angelica, white chrysanthemum, and polygala tenuifolia. By implementing the "Lei Gong preparation" method, they produced rhubarb stomach-strengthening powder, compound licorice mixture, and other tinctures. The equipment they created included enema devices and pelvic measurement devices. They had used their own prepared medicines and equipment to rescue many patients. One pregnant woman had a dead baby in her womb for three days. The comrades couldn't bear to watch the woman die, so they used single scissors as a craniotomy instrument to break the baby's skull and remove the baby, saving the woman's life. The herdsmen regarded these things as miracles and spread the word everywhere.
    While providing medical treatment, the medical team also used various methods and forms to promote health and prevention work in pastoral areas. Based on their investigations and understanding of the situation, combined with the vital interests of the herdsmen, and respecting their religious beliefs and customs, they widely promoted common knowledge about hygiene and disease prevention. In order to make the propaganda truly effective, they also came up with many ways to teach the herdsmen how to actually do things. For example, women of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas were particularly keen to hear explanations about maternal and child health knowledge. When explaining how to handle menstruation, the comrades taught them how to make sanitary menstrual belts; when explaining the transmission of germs, they took out microscopes so that each herdsman could see various terrible bacteria with their own eyes. Whenever the herdsmen gathered, entertained themselves, chatted, or even in the moment when patients were waiting for treatment, the medical team carried out propaganda about various pathologies and prevention methods at any time and place. The herdsmen found the content of the propaganda exceptionally fresh and valuable and discussed it, saying, "If we had known these principles earlier, our ethnic population would have prospered long ago." In a few months, more than 185,000 herdsmen received propaganda and education, accounting for 82% of the total population of the nine pastoral counties. Now, an unprecedented clean and sanitary scene has emerged in these areas. Few people tether livestock next to tents and water channels anymore, and few people drink raw water or eat sick livestock meat. No matter who you ask, everyone can answer: dirty things can transmit diseases. The herdsmen in the Fourth District of Gongliu County carried out a major cleanup in every household, washed their clothes and bedding clean, and elected health workers. In the past, there was not a single toilet or bathhouse in the pastoral areas of various counties, but now 2,140 toilets and 44 bathhouses have been built. The herdsmen have also newly dug 291 water wells and repaired more than 12,200 meters of drinking water canals, and no one drinks water from canals (ponds) used by livestock anymore. Every household has begun to choose dry land to live on, laying dry grass, and digging canals around the tents, and no one lives on damp grasslands anymore. The vast majority of households have gauze covers for filtering milk, and they wash the cow's udders clean before milking. Many families use boiling methods to eliminate lice.
    The medical team also held dozens of health worker and midwife training classes in the pastoral areas, training a total of 755 health workers and 581 midwives. Many health workers and midwives are good sons and daughters of the herdsmen. After graduating, they ride their horses everywhere to treat the people of their own ethnic groups and deliver babies. When midwife Kemisi started working, she encountered a woman with difficult labor, but she was completely like an experienced midwife, very calmly using the newly learned midwifery method, first saving the mother, and then using artificial respiration to save the newborn baby. In order to thank her, the family wanted to give her 200,000 yuan, but she refused, saying: "You should thank Chairman Mao, because I was trained by the lifesaving team sent by Chairman Mao." In 20 days, Tekes County midwife Mali Han delivered three babies, two of whom had difficult labor, and they were all delivered safely. Tuoli County specifically checked the work performance of the newly trained midwives and confirmed that after the midwives went to the countryside, the infant mortality rate had decreased by 12% compared to the past. Therefore, the herdsmen gratefully and praised: "The doctors sent by Chairman Mao are so good; in ten days and a half, they train ordinary people to be able to save lives."
    During the months of working in the pastoral areas, because the comrades truly respected the religious beliefs and customs of the people of all ethnic groups in the pastoral areas, wholeheartedly relieved the pain of illness of the people of all ethnic groups, and established deep feelings and friendship with the masses of herdsmen of all ethnic groups, loving each other like brothers and sisters. Many patients, after being cured, wanted to cook for the medical team, slaughter chickens and sheep, or send sheep, firewood, milk, eggs, and other things to express their gratitude. After the illness of the child of Grandpa Guban in Tuoli County was cured, Grandpa Guban specially went up the mountain to pick a lot of mushrooms and wild onions and sent them to the medical team. He said: "I know you can't accept our things, but these are all picked by my own hands, please accept them, this is my little token of appreciation!" A female labor model in Tuoli County said at the farewell meeting for the medical team: "Before liberation, we suffered killings and abuses; who cared about our pain of illness! At that time, if we got sick, we would sell cattle, horses, and children, and we couldn't find a doctor no matter how far we ran. Today, the doctors sent by Chairman Mao come to our door to see patients, cure many people of diseases that couldn't be cured for decades, and they don't even charge money..." Bayi Hejia in Xinyuan County composed a song after his illness was cured, and he sang it wherever he went. The song is:
    "In the remote mountains,
    Chairman Mao sent people to save lives;
    Let us always remember
    —Chairman Mao's kindness.
    They relieved us from the entanglement of disease,
    And also told us the source of illness;
    Let us always remember
    —Chairman Mao's kindness.
    Throw away the old things,
    Let science equip us;
    The people to save lives sent by Chairman Mao
    Brought us health and happiness!"
    The Kazakh and Mongolian herdsmen in this area often think and talk about this "lifesaving team." The health workers trained by the medical team often write letters and send things to the medical team. Doctor Lallov (Uzbek) wrote in his letter: "The herdsmen miss you, and I miss you too, because you saved many of their relatives and taught me how I should serve the people."

    “毛主席派来的救命队”
    ——记深入牧区替各族牧民治病的新疆军区的医疗队
    朗可
    救命的恩情，人们是永远不会遗忘的。
    新疆省塔城、新源、和丰、托里、额敏、巩哈、特克斯等九县牧区的哈萨克、蒙古等民族人民赠送给新疆军区医疗队的数十面锦旗上，都用其本民族的文字写着他们的心意：你们真是毛主席派来的救命队，让我们永远记着你们吧！
    这个医疗队全体工作人员在队长包德施等率领下，从一九五二年五月到十一月，在新疆牧区日日夜夜地工作。只要听到什么地方有病人，不管路途多远，是深山还是草原，也不管狂风暴雨，个个都是争先恐后地要求出诊。他们的口号是：“哪里有病人，就到哪里去！”他们走遍了阿尔泰山山麓和伊犁河畔的每个草原，共初诊梅毒、风湿病、肠胃病、皮肤病等患者六万三千零一十八人，复诊四万一千二百六十九人，治愈者占百分之五十九点七，病势减轻者占百分之二十点五。并给各县学生一万零二十六人检查了体格，给四千六百九十三人接种了牛痘，给一万六千九百零五人注射了各种防疫菌苗，给一百人接生，给四百二十九人检查了大便，给八百六十四人作了血片检查。
    医疗队的同志们爱护病人就像对自己的亲人一样，关照得无微不至。对病重的人，和贫苦的病人，就招待在自己带的帐篷里居住，并且拿出被子、棉衣给病人穿用；白天黑夜都有护士轮班护理，给饭喂水。托里县有一个患阑尾炎的病人，医疗工作人员给他开刀诊治后，便亲切地留他静养，日夜给他排尿灌肠，喂饭，整整护理了两个昼夜。和丰县有个叫阿河的牧民，患了重病，同志们从很远的地方把他背到医疗队的住处，经心地诊断治疗。等阿河的病势转危为安以后，又把他背着送回去。
    为了克服药械不足的困难，大家以“任何困难都难不住解放军”的信心，提出“没有药料深山找，没有器械开动脑筋搞”的口号，并以志愿军指战员在朝鲜前线的英雄事迹来鼓舞自己。他们没有一个人在困难面前低头。如在制硫酸钠时，同志们来去跑了几百里路扫硝土，前后熬了几次才试验成功。在采药的深山密林里，同志们常是忍饥受饿，露宿在戈壁上、松树底下。采集的药材中，有大黄、麦冬、阿魏、党参、当归、白菊花、远志等数十种。经过实行“雷公炮制”的方法，制出了大黄健胃散、复方甘草合剂及其他酊剂。创制的器械，有灌肠器、骨盘测量器等。他们曾用自己炮制的药材和器械急救了许多病人。有一个产妇，婴儿死在肚子里已经三天了，同志们不忍看着产妇活活死去，便设法用单剪刀代替钻颅器，破碎了婴儿头骨，才将婴儿取出，救了产妇的生命。牧民们把这些事当作奇迹，到处传颂着。
    医疗队在进行医疗的同时，还用各种方法、形式，作了牧区卫生预防工作的宣传。他们根据调查了解的情况，结合牧民们的切身利益，又在尊重其宗教信仰和风俗习惯的原则下，广泛地宣传了讲求卫生与预防疾病的常识。为了使宣传真正起作用，他们还想了许多办法，教给牧民实际去做。如牧区各族妇女格外爱听讲解有关妇婴卫生的常识，同志们在讲解到怎样处理月经时，就教给她们做卫生月经带的方法；在讲解病菌传染时，就拿出显微镜让每个牧民亲眼去看各种可怕的细菌。每逢牧民集会、娱乐、闲聊时，甚至在病人候诊的一刹那，医疗队都随时随地进行有关各种病理及预防方法的宣传。牧民们对于宣传的内容，感到异常新鲜和可贵，纷纷议论着说：“要早知道这些道理的话，我们民族的人口早就兴旺了。”在几个月中，受到宣传教育的牧民就有十八万五千多人，占了九县牧区总人口的百分之八十二。现在，这些地区都出现了空前未有的清洁卫生景象。在帐篷和水渠旁边，很少有人再拴牲畜了，也很少有人再喝生水和吃病畜肉了。不论你问谁，谁都能回答：脏东西会传染疾病。巩哈县四区的牧民，家家户户都进行了大扫除，衣被也洗得干干净净，还选举了卫生员。各县牧区过去没有一个厕所、澡塘，现在修建起厕所二千一百四十个，洗澡塘四十四个。牧民们还新打了水井二百九十一个，修整了饮水渠一万二千二百余公尺，谁也不再吃饮了牲畜的水渠（池）中的水了。家家户户的住地都开始选择干地，铺上干草，在帐篷的周围还挖了水渠，再没人家住在潮湿的草地上了。绝大部分的人家都有了滤奶的纱罩，并且都是先将牛的乳房洗干净才挤奶。许多家庭都用水煮法，消灭了虱子。
    医疗队还在牧区先后举办了数十次卫生员和接生员训练班，共培养出七百五十五个卫生员和五百八十一个接生员。很多卫生员、接生员都是牧民的好子女。他们毕业后，每天骑着马到处给本民族的人民治病、接生。接生员克米西一开始工作，就碰到一个难产的产妇，但她完全像一个富有经验的助产士，十分沉着地用新学会的接生法，先救活了母亲，又用人工呼吸法，救活了初生的婴儿。这家人为了感谢她，要送她二十万元人民币，但她拒绝了，并说：“你应该感谢毛主席，因为我是毛主席派来的救命队训练出来的。”特克斯县接生员玛丽汉在二十天内接生了三个娃娃，其中有两个难产的，也都安全地生下来了。托里县专门把新培养的接生员的工作成绩检查了一下，证实了接生员下乡后，婴儿死亡率比过去已经降低了百分之十二。因此，牧民们感激和赞扬地说：“毛主席派来的医生真好，十天半月，就把普通人训练得能救活人命。”
    在牧区工作的几个月间，由于同志们真正做到了尊重牧区各族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，全心全意地为各族人民解除疾病痛苦，和各族牧民群众相互之间建立了深厚的感情和友谊，像兄弟姊妹般地相亲相爱。许多病人在被治愈后，有的要给医疗队做饭，有的杀鸡宰羊或送来羊只、柴火、奶子、鸡蛋等物，表示谢意。托里县古班老大爷的小孩的病被治好后，老大爷特意上山拾了许多蘑菇和野葱，送到医疗队。他说：“我知道你们不能收我们的东西，可是，这些都是我亲手拾来的，请收下吧，这是我的一点心意呵！”托里县的一个女劳动模范在欢送医疗队的会上说：“解放前，我们受尽屠杀、糟踏，有谁关怀过我们的疾病痛苦！那时候，我们要生了病，卖牛卖马、卖孩子，跑多少路都请不来个医生。今天，毛主席派来的医生找到我们门上看病，治好许多人几十年也没法治的病，还不要钱……。”新源县的巴依禾加在病被治好后，编了一首歌，走到哪里，唱到哪里。这首歌是：
    “在偏僻的山野里，
    毛主席派来了救命的人；
    永远记着吧
    ——毛主席的恩情。
    替我们解除了病魔的纠缠，
    还告诉我们生病的根源；
    永远记着吧
    ——毛主席的恩情。
    把陈旧的东西丢掉，
    让科学来装备我们；
    毛主席派来的救命的人，
    给我们带来了健壮和幸福！”
    这一带的哈萨克、蒙古民族的男女牧民们常常想到和谈到这个“救命队”。医疗队培养出来的卫生工作人员还常常写信和捎来东西给医疗队。医生拉洛夫（乌兹别克族）的信中写着：“牧民们怀念着你们，我也怀念着你们，因为你们救活了他们的许多亲属，教会了我应该怎样为人民服务。”
