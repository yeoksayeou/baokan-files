From April 27th to 29th, most areas of the five provinces of Songjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe in Northeast China, and the northeastern part of Hebei Province and the southern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in North China experienced spring rain. The rainfall was heavier in the southern half of Songjiang Province and most of Jilin Province. In the northern half of Liaoxi Province, counties such as Kangping were thoroughly soaked. The remaining areas had soil moistened by half an inch to one or two inches. At the same time, Shandong Province and the eastern half of Henan Province, the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces, and parts of Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces also received rain. The rainfall was more abundant near Qingdao, near Xuzhou, and in the Kaifeng and Anyang areas of Henan Province, generally permeating the soil. In the northern part of Shandong Province, areas such as Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Huimin had one to two inches of moist soil.

The farmland in these areas is in urgent need of rain. Wheat in Henan and Shandong provinces is about to head, and some autumn-harvested crops have not yet been sown. In Northeast China, autumn crops are about to be sown, but due to the lack of spring rain this year, drought is severe in provinces such as Liaoxi, Rehe, and Songjiang. In Liaoxi Province, the dry soil is generally three to four inches deep on flat land, and five to six inches deep in higher areas. Many wells and small rivers have dried up, making spring planting very difficult. Therefore, this spring rain is very beneficial for spring planting and crop growth.

All regions should seize this favorable opportunity to do a good job in spring planting and seedling protection. In areas of Northeast China where the soil has been thoroughly soaked, spring planting should be carried out in a timely manner while the soil is still moist. In areas where the soil has not been thoroughly soaked, planting needs to be done by borrowing moisture or taking advantage of dampness. In Henan and Shandong provinces, in addition to sowing while it rains, attention should be paid to hoeing wheat and applying topdressing fertilizer after the rain. In short, complacency and slackening after the rain must be prevented.

### 东北大部地区和华北等部分地区降雨  各地应抓紧时机趁墒抢播，防止雨后松懈麻痹思想

    东北大部地区和华北等部分地区降雨
    各地应抓紧时机趁墒抢播，防止雨后松懈麻痹思想
    四月二十七日到二十九日，东北区的松江、吉林、辽东、辽西、热河五省大部地区和华北区河北省东北部、内蒙古自治区的南部都下了春雨。松江省南半部和吉林省大部降雨量较大，辽西省的北半部康平等县已下透了。其余地区浸湿土壤半寸到一二寸不等。与此同时，山东省和河南省东半部、江苏安徽两省的北部地区和陕西、甘肃两省部分地区都下了雨，青岛附近，徐州附近和河南省开封、安阳一带降雨较多，一般已透墒。山东省的北部聊城、德州、惠民等地区湿土一二寸。
    这些地区的农田正在迫切需要雨水，河南、山东等省小麦将要吐穗，部分秋收作物尚未播种；东北区秋季作物将要播种，但因这些地区今年春雨较少，辽西、热河、松江等省旱象都很严重，辽西省一般平地干土三、四寸，较高地带干土五、六寸，许多水井和小河都干涸了，春播十分困难。因此，这场春雨，对于春播和作物生长都是很有利的。
    各地都要抓紧这个有利时机，做好春播和保苗工作。东北区已得透墒的地区，应适时趁墒突击春播；尚未透墒的地区，需要借墒或趁湿浇种。河南、山东两省，除了趁雨播种以外，需要在雨后注意锄麦和施追肥。总之，要防止雨后松懈麻痹思想。
