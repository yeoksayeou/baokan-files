Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th – The Korean Central News Agency reported on the 18th that the Minister of Agriculture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Mun-kyu, gave a statement to a reporter from the Korean Central News Agency regarding the American invaders' planned and indiscriminate bombing of irrigation facilities in Korean rural areas, creating floods. Park Mun-kyu said: Recently, the US government has mobilized its air force to continuously carry out large-scale, inhumane, and brutal bombings against peaceful facilities and rural areas in our rear, destroying irrigation reservoirs vital to the lives of farmers. Crops that farmers had been cultivating since early spring and seedlings that were only a dozen days away from being transplanted were washed away by floods and mud, causing numerous farmers to drown. This is clearly a planned action. While armistice negotiations are underway, the enemy's atrocity is clearly part of a conspiracy to obstruct the armistice talks.

Park Mun-kyu said: The Workers' Party and the Republic's government are taking emergency rescue measures to aid disaster victims and vigorously ensure the stability of disaster victims' lives and this year's agricultural work. At the same time, all farmers are helping each other, sending clothes, seeds, and farming tools to farmers in disaster areas.

Park Mun-kyu emphasized in conclusion: No matter what atrocities the enemy commits or what sinister conspiracies they carry out, they will never be able to subdue the Korean people, but will only arouse greater anger among the Korean people and the people of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th – While obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations, the American invaders are systematically and indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities and towns in Korea and destroying peaceful facilities in the Korean rear, creating man-made floods. In the four days from the 13th to the 16th, the US Air Force successively bombed three reservoirs in the Korean rear used for irrigating farmland. After bombing the Seokam reservoir in the Sunan-Pyongan Plain area on the 13th and 14th, they bombed the Jasan reservoir in Sunchon County, South Pyongan Province, on the 15th and 16th. On the 16th, US aircraft also bombed the Yongsong-Maram reservoir in the suburbs of Pyongyang.

The bombing of the Jasan reservoir by US aircraft once again demonstrates that this criminal act of the American invaders was carried out in a planned manner. Eight US aircraft first bombed the Jasan reservoir at 6:30 PM on the 15th, dropping more than 50 bombs and destroying part of the dam. Local farmers immediately worked to repair it to prevent the water in the reservoir from flowing out. However, the American bandits dispatched 46 aircraft in a single day on the 16th, bombing the reservoir five times in a row. As a result, dozens of meters of the reservoir's dam were destroyed, and a large amount of water flowed into the vast fields in the nearby area. According to preliminary statistics, hundreds of hectares of cultivated land and more than 40 farmhouses have been flooded and damaged.

Enemy aircraft that committed this criminal act were severely punished by our air defense forces. Four enemy aircraft that bombed the Jasan reservoir were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and one enemy aircraft that bombed the Yongsong-Maram reservoir was also shot down.

Korean farmers who suffered from floods because the Jasan reservoir and the Seokam reservoir in the Sunan-Pyongan Plain area were destroyed by US aircraft have received relief and resettlement from the Emergency Relief Committee organized by the Korean Workers' Party and the government. Disaster victims received food, seeds, and relief supplies from the people of various People's Democratic countries. Many medical workers have arrived in the disaster areas to treat injured farmers. People in nearby areas have also launched a movement to help disaster victims. Some vacated their houses, some adopted orphans, and some donated food.

The affected farmers unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Workers' Party and the government for their concern and care. Han Seok-tae, a family member of a soldier, said: "Thirty years ago, we suffered a major flood, and we had no one to rely on. Now, although the enemy maliciously created a man-made flood, our government has helped us disaster-stricken farmers solve the problems of housing and agricultural production. We are all determined to do everything in our power to restore the destroyed land, support the front lines, and defeat the enemy."

    朝鲜农业相斥责美国轰炸朝鲜贮水池
    劳动党和共和国政府正大力救济灾民
    【新华社平壤十九日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社十八日讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁农业相朴文圭就美国侵略者有计划地滥炸朝鲜农村的灌溉设施，制造水灾的暴行，对朝鲜中央通讯社记者发表谈话。朴文圭说：最近美国政府动员其空军对我后方的和平设施和农村地带连续进行大规模的丧尽人性的残暴轰炸，破坏与农民生死攸关的灌溉设施贮水池，使农民们从初春就开始耕作的农作物和再有十几天就可以插秧的苗芽都被洪水和泥沙冲毁了，使众多的农民惨遭溺死，这显然是有计划的行动。当停战谈判正在进行的今天，敌人的这种暴行分明是阻挠停战谈判的阴谋的一部分。
    朴文圭说：劳动党与共和国政府正在采取紧急的救护措施，援救灾民，并大力保障灾民生活的安定及今年的农耕工作。同时，全体农民们也进行互助，把衣物、种籽、农具等送给灾区农民。
    朴文圭最后着重指出：不论敌人制造什么样的暴行和进行什么样的险恶阴谋，都绝不可能使朝鲜人民屈服，而只能激起朝鲜人民和全世界人民更大的愤怒。
    【新华社平壤十九日电】美国侵略者在阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的同时，正有计划地滥炸朝鲜和平城乡，破坏朝鲜后方和平设施，制造人工水灾。美国空军在十三日到十六日的四天中，接连轰炸了朝鲜后方三个用于农田灌溉的贮水池。美机在十三、十四两日炸毁了顺安—平原地区的石岩贮水池后，十五、十六两日，又炸毁了平安南道顺川郡的慈山贮水池。十六日，美机并对平壤近郊的龙城—马岚贮水池进行了轰炸。
    美机轰炸慈山贮水池的经过，再一次说明了美国侵略者这种罪恶暴行是有计划地进行的。美机八架在十五日下午六时半第一次轰炸慈山贮水池，投弹五十多颗，炸毁了堤坝的一部分。当地农民立即进行抢修工作，防止池内存水流出。但是，美国强盗又在十六日一天中先后派遣飞机四十六架，连续五次轰炸这个贮水池。结果，贮水池的堤坝被炸毁数十公尺，大量贮水流到附近地区的广大田野里。据初步统计，洪水已淹没和冲坏了数百公顷的耕地和四十多户农家。
    制造这种罪恶暴行的敌机受到我方防空部队的严惩。轰炸慈山贮水池的敌机，有四架被高射炮火击落，轰炸龙城—马岚贮水池的敌机也被击落一架。
    因为慈山贮水池和顺安—平原地区的石岩贮水池被美机炸毁而遭到水灾的朝鲜农民，都已得到朝鲜劳动党和政府组织的紧急救护委员会的救济和安置。灾民们领到了粮食、种籽和各人民民主国家人民送来的救济物资。许多医务工作者已经到达灾区给受伤的农民治疗。在附近地区的人民也展开了援助灾民的运动。他们有的腾出房子，有的收养孤儿，有的捐助粮食。
    受灾农民一致感激劳动党和政府对他们的关怀和照顾。军人家属韩锡泰说：“三十年前，我们曾遭受过一次大水灾，那时我们毫无依靠。现在，虽然敌人恶毒地制造了人工的水灾，但是我们的政府帮助我们受灾农民解决了房子和农业生产的问题。我们都决心尽一切力量来恢复被毁坏的土地，支援前线，战胜敌人。”
