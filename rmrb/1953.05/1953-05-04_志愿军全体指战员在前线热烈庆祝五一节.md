Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 3rd: The entire command and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warmly celebrated International Labor Day, "May Day," on the Korean front lines.

    On the morning of the 1st, commanders and fighters of various units, with excited hearts, gathered on hilltops or in tunnel fortifications to listen to the live broadcast of the "May Day" celebration parade from the motherland's capital, Beijing. When the radio announced that Chairman Mao had arrived at Tiananmen Square, the commanders and fighters erupted in enthusiastic applause and cheers.

    At the celebration meeting held by the Volunteer Army's leadership, Deputy Commander Deng Hua delivered a report amidst thunderous applause. He said: International Labor Day, "May Day," is a festival of unity and struggle for the working people of the world. For more than three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the working class and all working people of our country have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and have achieved great victories on the economic construction front. On behalf of all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army, I extend warm respect and congratulations to Chairman Mao, the working class, and all working people of the motherland, and express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of the motherland for their full support. We will respond to the people of the motherland with victorious battles.

    Deputy Commander Deng Hua then pointed out: In order to eliminate the disagreement over the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war, which is the only obstacle to the Korean armistice, we have made obvious concessions in the steps and methods of repatriating all prisoners of war. We are doing this entirely to achieve the armistice in Korea and entirely for the peace of the Far East and the world. This fact has been recognized by the people of the world. However, the problem cannot be solved by our efforts alone, so all of our commanders and fighters must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the enemy.

    The various units, services, and departments of the Volunteer Army also held warm celebration gatherings during the festival.

    志愿军全体指战员在前线热烈庆祝五一节
   【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员在朝鲜前线热烈庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。
    一日早晨，各部指挥员战斗员们怀着激动的心情，聚集在山头上或坑道工事里收听祖国首都——北京“五一”庆祝游行的实况广播。当收音机里传出毛主席到达天安门的消息时，指挥员战斗员们发出了热烈的掌声和欢呼声。
    在志愿军领导机关举行的庆祝大会上，邓华副司令员在雷动的掌声中做了报告。他说：“五一”国际劳动节是全世界劳动人民团结和战斗的节日。三年多来，我国工人阶级和全体劳动人民在毛主席的领导下，发挥了高度的劳动热情，在经济建设战线上取得了伟大的胜利。我谨代表志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员，向毛泽东主席和祖国工人阶级以及全体劳动人民致以热烈的敬意和祝贺，并对祖国人民给予我们的全力支援表示衷心的感谢。我们要用战斗的胜利来回答祖国人民。
    邓华副司令员接着指出：我们为了消除造成朝鲜停战唯一障碍的全部战俘遣返问题上的分歧，在遣返全部战俘的步骤、方法等方面作了明显的让步。我们这样做，完全是为了实现朝鲜的停战，完全是为了远东和世界的和平。这一事实，已为全世界人民所公认。但是，单凭我们一方的努力是不能解决问题的，因此我们全体指挥员战斗员必须对敌人保持高度的警惕。
    志愿军的各部队、各兵种、各机关在节日也都举行了热烈的庆祝集会。
