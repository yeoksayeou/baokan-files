The CPC Jiangyou County Committee Leads Farmers to Find Water Sources
Basically Ensuring Full Rice Planting

    The Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Jiangyou County Committee in Sichuan Province has strengthened its leadership in drought prevention and resistance, launching a mass movement to find water sources, basically ensuring the full planting of rice this year.
    Jiangyou County suffered a severe drought this spring. At the end of February, statistics from eight districts showed that one-fifth of the ponds had dried up, reducing the irrigated area by nearly 20,000 mu. According to statistics from four districts, more than 40,000 mu of winter water fields had dried up.
    At the end of March, cadres from the CPC Jiangyou County Committee went to the countryside in separate groups to cooperate with district and township cadres in launching a mass movement to find water sources, combining it with the leadership of spring plowing. During the movement, the cadres adopted the method of focusing on demonstrations to educate the masses with vivid examples. For example, Xiao Shoucai, a member of the county committee, led farmers in Mingshui Township in the Fifth District to find water sources. Thanks to the active leadership of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, they found a spring of water that could irrigate more than 60 mu of land. This fact eliminated the "fear of trouble" and superstitious conservative ideas of some farmers. Many farmers took active action. The water sources found throughout the township, plus blocking water and returning water to save fields, can irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land, ensuring full rice planting. Driven by Mingshui Township, the other six townships in the Fifth District also launched a mass movement to find water sources, which has solved the irrigation problem for 3,120 mu of land. The water source finding movement in other districts has also achieved great results. So far, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 121 water sources have been found in the county, which can irrigate about 40,000 mu of land. Now, the drought situation in Jiangyou County has been greatly alleviated, and the full rice planting has been basically completed. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    中共江油县委领导农民找水源
    基本上保证了水稻满栽满插
    中共四川省江油县委员会加强防旱抗旱的领导，展开群众性的找水源运动，基本上保证了今年水稻满栽满插。
    江油县今春干旱严重。二月底，据八个区的统计，干塘已占五分之一，灌溉面积减少了近两万亩；又据四个区的统计：冬水田已干涸的有四万多亩。
    三月底，中共江油县委员会干部就分头下乡，配合区乡干部，结合领导春耕，开展了群众性的找水源运动。在运动中，干部们采用了重点示范，以活人活事教育群众的方法。如县委委员萧首财在第五区明水乡领导农民找水源，由于共产党员、青年团员积极带头，找到了浸水一股，能灌田六十多亩。这一事实，消除了部分农民“怕麻烦”和迷信保守思想。许多农民积极行动起来。全乡找到的水源，加上堵水、回水救田等，可灌溉一千多亩田，保证了水稻满栽满插。在明水乡的带动下，第五区的其他六个乡都掀起了群众性的找水源运动，已解决三千一百二十亩田的灌溉问题。其他各区找水源运动同样也有很大成绩。到目前为止，据不完全统计，全县共找到水源一百二十一处，可灌田四万亩左右。现在，江油县旱象已大为减轻，水稻满栽满插已基本完成。    （据新华社讯）
