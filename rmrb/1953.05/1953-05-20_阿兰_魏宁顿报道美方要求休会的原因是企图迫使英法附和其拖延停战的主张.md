Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to a report from Panmunjom by Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker": The US bombing of the Sunan Reservoir, one of the largest reservoirs in Korea, coupled with the US Information Service's report that "another stalemate is forming in Panmunjom," should shatter any illusions that still exist about the intentions of those in Washington who advocate "going it alone." The US's barbaric action of destroying the Sunan Reservoir annotated what Harrison told reporters when he proposed the recess. He said he did not know "the attitude of our allies across the ocean," and "all I know is everything we are doing here."

It is believed here that American commentators are being ordered to write reports saying that the reason for the recess is to enable the US to drive its allies to endorse the proposition of not immediately ending the war. The pretext of portraying the Korean War as a United Nations action is no longer useful; the Americans are now openly stating the fact that has always existed—the US is the master. This has been the reality under the guise of the "United Nations" ever since Truman forced the UN to participate in the war and MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel, presenting the allies with a fait accompli. "Allied" troops have been used to spare US troops from losses; this has become a frequently used tactic. In all cases, the Americans pull back, leaving the British, Turks, and French to take the beating. In 1950, British troops advanced north on US orders, while the Americans were hurrying south to escape. Colonel Kahn of the Gloucester Regiment later called the brigade headquarters in a critical situation, telling them, "We are surrounded by Chinese troops." The brigade headquarters told him, "Don't be silly, we have American troops on both sides." But he is now a prisoner.

In Panmunjom, European and British journalists work under American control, complaining that political censorship forces them to write their reports elsewhere. The parts that censors cut from their reports are placed in the files of the counterintelligence corps and the FBI. The only two military public relations officers who came here, a Dutch officer and a British captain, were ordered away by the Americans, and the British captain was barred from all American clubs for being "anti-American." When European journalists refused to fabricate stories of abuse of UN prisoners of war in accordance with orders from the US State Department, they were publicly insulted by the Americans. British officers had to intervene to prevent American journalists from attributing atrocity stories to British prisoners of war.

At the time when the public expressed the greatest anger towards the US's delay of the armistice last year, the British Alexander and Lloyd visited Korea, which resulted in General Sussmith of the British army being brought to Tokyo to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff to Clark to alleviate public pressure. Since then, who has heard of his name? Harrison's farce, the rampant and repeated destructive air raids that undermine the armistice, and the continued warfare illustrate how much role Sussmith plays in Clark's headquarters.

After Washington learned of the proposals in Churchill's recent speech, they bombed Antung, just as they bombed the Yalu River hydroelectric power plants last year when peace was approaching. What Washington is now showing is that the US intends to continue deceiving world public opinion, ignoring the UN resolutions it voted for, and continuing to use the unwilling British, French, and other allies to cover up its determination to maintain hot and cold wars. Dulles, who instigated Syngman Rhee to invade across the 38th parallel, is guiding this policy: avoiding high-level meetings, maintaining the cold war and the arms race to impoverish its allies, preventing trade between East and West, and stifling Europe. But the whole world can now see through the US policy, and it is not too late for the US allies to break away from those crazy Forrestal's disciples who harbor dangerous delusions of global hegemony. The main fact is clear: peace can be achieved immediately in Korea based on a fair and magnanimous policy that everyone—except the American war bloc—recognizes.

### 阿兰·魏宁顿报道美方要求休会的原因是企图迫使英法附和其拖延停战的主张

    阿兰·魏宁顿报道美方要求休会的原因是企图迫使英法附和其拖延停战的主张
    【新华社十九日讯】据伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿自板门店报道：美方在上星期轰炸了朝鲜最大贮水池之一——顺安贮水池，加上美国新闻处关于“另一个僵局正在板门店形成”的报道，这应当可以粉碎对于华盛顿那一派主张“单独干下去”的人的意图还存在着的任何幻想。美方破坏顺安贮水池的野蛮行动，给哈利逊在提议休会时向记者们所说的话作了一个注解。他说，他不知道“海洋彼岸我们友邦们的态度”，“我所知道的仅仅是我们在这里所进行着的一切”。
    此间认为，美国的评论员们正在奉命撰写报道，说休会的原因是为了使得美国能够驱策它的盟国附和不立即停战的主张。把朝鲜战争说成是联合国的行动，这种借口已经没有用处了，美国人现在公然说出一向存在的事实——美国是主人。从杜鲁门迫使联合国参战以来，从麦克阿瑟越过三八线，使盟国面对既成事实以来，这本来就是一向在“联合国”幌子下存在的实际情况。“盟国”的军队被用来使美军避免受到损失，这已成为一种经常使用的办法了。在所有情况下都是如此，美国人抽身出来让英国人、土耳其人、法国人去挨打。一九五○年，英国军队奉美国的命令向北前进，而美国人则在急急忙忙地向南逃跑。格罗斯特团的卡恩上校在后来一次危急的场合下打电话给旅部，告诉他们说：“我们被中国军队包围了。”旅部告诉他：“不要那末傻，我们的两侧还有美国军队在那里。”可是他现在是个俘虏。
    在板门店，欧洲和英国的记者们在美国的控制下工作，他们诉苦说，政治检查迫使他们到别地方去写报道。检查员从他们的报道中所删节下来的那些部分，都归入了反间谍队和联邦调查局的档案。到这里来的两个仅有的军中新闻军官，一个荷兰军官和一个英国上尉，被美国人下令赶走了，而英国上尉由于“反美”的原故，不得进入美国人的一切俱乐部。当欧洲记者们拒绝遵照美国国务院的命令捏造联军战俘受虐待的消息时，他们受到美国人的公开侮辱。英国军官不得不出面干涉，阻止美国记者把暴行消息说成是英国战俘说的。
    在去年公众对美国的拖延停战表示最大愤怒的时候，英国的亚历山大和劳埃德访问了朝鲜，结果就把英国的苏斯米斯将军弄到东京来给克拉克当副参谋长，来缓和公众的压力。自从那时以来，有谁听到过他的名字？哈利逊的滑稽剧，气焰嚣张地一再进行的破坏停战的空袭以及战争的仍然继续，说明苏斯米斯在克拉克总部里起的作用究竟有多少。
    在华盛顿得悉了邱吉尔最近演说中的主张以后，他们轰炸了安东，正如去年和平迫近时他们轰炸鸭绿江水电厂一样。现在华盛顿所显示的迹象是：美方打算继续愚弄全世界的舆论，忽视它投票通过的联合国决议，并且继续把满心不愿意的英国、法国和其他盟国用来遮掩它维持热战和冷战的决心。唆使李承晚侵越三八线的杜勒斯，正在指导着这种政策，即：避免举行高级会议，维持冷战和军备竞赛来使它的盟国陷于贫困，阻止东西方之间的贸易和窒息欧洲。但是整个世界现在能够看透美国的政策了，美国的盟国要摆脱那些怀着独霸全球的危险妄想的疯狂的福莱斯特尔的弟子们，现在还来得及。主要的事实是清楚的，和平是可以根据每个人——除了美国战争集团外——都承认的公平而气度宽宏的政策而立即在朝鲜实现的。
