More than 400 students from Northeast Institute of Technology and Dalian Institute of Technology graduate to participate in economic construction

Recently, 433 students from Northeast Institute of Technology and Dalian Institute of Technology graduated and took up various construction jobs. This year, 1,500 students will graduate from Northeast Institute of Technology, of which 329 students from the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and the Department of Architecture have recently graduated three months ahead of schedule, and another 721 students will graduate successively in May, June, and July. After the decision of the personnel departments of the Central People's Government and relevant industrial departments, this batch of graduates from Northeast Institute of Technology and Dalian Institute of Technology were assigned to work in various industrial sectors and relevant factories and mining enterprises. Graduates of Northeast Institute of Technology have been assigned to serve in the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government and Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other departments; some students remain in the school as teaching assistants. Of the 104 graduates from the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing and the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of Dalian Institute of Technology, most were assigned to the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, the Nonferrous Metals Administration Bureau, and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, while some remained at the school as teaching assistants.

Yao Lian, a lecturer at Nanjing Institute of Technology, successfully trial-produces a metallographic microscope

Yao Lian, a lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering at Nanjing Institute of Technology, has successfully trial-produced a metallographic microscope. This is a major contribution to China's economic construction and scientific research. The metallographic microscope is an essential tool in industrial production for metallurgy, casting, metallography, and heat treatment, as well as in scientific research. Yao Lian, a lecturer at Nanjing Institute of Technology, began research and self-manufacturing in the summer of 1950, using the lens and lens barrel of a biological microscope, and designing his own using domestic raw materials. He manufactured complex devices such as illuminators and reflectors, and all other accessories in the affiliated mechanical factory of Nanjing Institute of Technology. After more than two years of hard work, four metallographic microscopes were recently successfully trial-produced. The crystalline structure of various metal products such as steel and ductile iron is very clear under a 2,500-times magnification lens, and it is possible to take preliminary photos of the magnified metal crystalline structure. The research work is now in the final stages of technically improving the photographic equipment and trial-producing other accessories. The Higher Education Bureau of the East China Administrative Committee approved Yao Lian's research report and trial production plan in mid-April, and allocated cash and equipment for Yao Lian to continue his research. Nanjing Institute of Technology also strongly supported this research work with manpower, materials, and equipment.

    东北、大连两工学院有四百余名学生毕业参加经济建设工作
    东北工学院和大连工学院最近有四百三十三名学生毕业，走上各种建设工作岗位。东北工学院今年毕业的学生有一千五百名，其中机电、建筑两系的三百二十九名已在最近提前三个月毕业，还有七百二十一名学生也将在五、六、七月中陆续毕业。东北工学院和大连工学院这批毕业学生经过中央人民政府人事部门和有关产业部门决定，分配到各产业部门和有关厂矿企业工作。东北工学院的毕业生已被分配到中央人民政府重工业部和鞍山钢铁公司等部门服务；有一部分学生留在校内作助教。大连工学院机械系机械制造专业和土木系水利专业的一百零四名毕业生，除一部分留校作助教外，多数都被分配到中央人民政府水利部、中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业管理局、有色金属管理局和鞍山钢铁公司等单位服务。
    南京工学院讲师姚琏试装金相显微镜成功
    南京工学院土木工程系讲师姚琏试装金相显微镜成功。这对我国经济建设和科学研究工作是一重大贡献。金相显微镜是工业生产中冶金、铸造、金相和热处理以及在科学研究方面所必需的重要工具。南京工学院讲师姚琏从一九五零年夏季起进行研究自制，利用生物显微镜的镜头、镜筒，并采用国产原料自己设计，他在南京工学院附属机械工厂制造出照明器、反射器等复杂装置和所有其他配件。经过两年多的努力钻研，最近正式试装成功四架金相显微镜。钢、球墨铸铁等各种金属制成品的结晶组织，在放大二千五百倍的镜头下，看得非常清晰，并能初步拍摄经过放大后的金属结晶组织的照片。现在研究工作正最后从技术上改进照相设备，试制其他附属器材等。华东行政委员会高等教育局在四月中批准了姚琏的研究报告和试造计划，并拨现款和器材供姚琏继续研究。南京工学院也在人力、物力以及设备上大力支持了这一研究工作。
