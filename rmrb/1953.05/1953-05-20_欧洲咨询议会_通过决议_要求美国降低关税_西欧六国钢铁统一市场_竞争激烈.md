Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch: Strasbourg Dispatch: The European Consultative Assembly, comprised of parliamentarians from fourteen European nations, held a meeting in Strasbourg on the twelfth and thirteenth. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the United States lower tariffs, simplify customs procedures, and develop trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

British Labour Party MP George Brown said at the meeting: Western Europe has reason to convince the United States that we want trade. The United States must relax trade restrictions, otherwise it must bear the responsibility for creating "a most unpleasant situation." British Conservative Party MP Robert Boothby also advocated this, saying: Europe must try to find its own remedy for "economic ills" and must stop asking the United States for money. The time has come to do so.

Xinhua News Agency, Nineteenth Dispatch: TASS Moscow, Sixteenth Dispatch: *Pravda*'s Paris correspondent, Lasakin, wrote an article commenting on the contradictions among the countries of the Schuman Plan.

France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany have linked their economic future with the Schuman Plan, that is, with the so-called European Coal and Steel "Community."

The Schuman Plan helps restore the war industrial strength of the Ruhr. The disastrous impact of this plan on the national economic development of various countries has become increasingly obvious, and the internal contradictions of the European Coal and Steel "Community" have become increasingly acute.

Lasakin cited the decline of the French coal mining industry as an example. In the first quarter of 1953, France mined nearly 100,000 tons less coal than in the same period last year. In March of this year, there were nearly 6,000 fewer miners in France than in March of last year. At the same time, imports of coal, mainly from West Germany, have increased. In France, it costs 650 francs more to mine a ton of coal than in West Germany, which makes it easier for Ruhr magnates to penetrate the French market.

Due to the opening of the "Steel Unified Market of Six Western European Countries," steel companies in various countries, pursuing dominance and maximum profits, have launched fierce competition. Last year, these countries produced a total of 41.5 million tons of steel. Among them, West Germany produced 15.8 million tons, and the France-Saar Group produced 13.7 million tons. Therefore, West Germany and France are the main competitors of the alliance. Of the 10 million tons of steel exported by the European Coal and Steel Community countries, West Germany accounts for the largest share, while France exports an average of 1.8 million tons of steel per year. In order to protect itself against West German competition, French steel monopolies stipulate a 16 percent tax on imported steel. West German monopolies have also taken measures to protect their market against French competition. On May 5, the West German Federal Parliament passed a bill authorizing the government to raise the import tax rate on heavy industrial products from 6 percent to 12 percent.

### “欧洲咨询议会”通过决议  要求美国降低关税  “西欧六国钢铁统一市场”竞争激烈

    “欧洲咨询议会”通过决议
    要求美国降低关税
    “西欧六国钢铁统一市场”竞争激烈
    【新华社十八日讯】斯特拉斯堡消息：由欧洲十四国议员参加的欧洲咨询议会在十二日和十三日在斯特拉斯堡举行了一次会议。会上一致通过了一个决议，要求美国降低关税，简化报关手续，并且要求发展和苏联及人民民主国家的贸易。
    英国工党议员乔治·布罗克在会上说：西欧有理由叫美国相信，我们要贸易。美国必须放宽贸易限制，不然就必须承当造成“一种最不快的局面”责任。英国保守党议员罗伯特·布斯比也这样主张，他说：欧洲要设法找到它自己对于“经济病症”的药方，并且要停止再向美国要钱。现在已经到了这样做的时候了。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：“真理报”驻巴黎记者拉萨金写文章评论舒曼计划各国之间的矛盾。
    法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和西德已经把它们的经济前途和舒曼计划连在一起，也就是和所谓欧洲煤钢“联营”连在一起。
    舒曼计划帮助恢复鲁尔的战争工业力量。这个计划对各国的国民经济发展的灾害性影响已经越来越明显，而欧洲煤钢“联营”内部的矛盾也就越来越尖锐。
    拉萨金举法国煤矿工业的衰落为例。在一九五三年第一季，法国开采的煤比去年同期少了差不多十万吨。今年三月法国的矿工比去年三月少了差不多六千人。同时，主要是来自西德的进口煤却增加了。在法国，开采一吨煤要比在西德多花六百五十法郎，这就使得鲁尔巨头更容易渗入法国市场。
    由于“西欧六国钢铁统一市场”开放，追逐支配地位和最大利润的各国钢铁公司已经展开了激烈的竞争。各国去年共生产了四千一百五十万吨钢。其中西德生产了一千五百八十万吨，法国—萨尔集团一千三百七十万吨。因此，西德和法国是联营的主要竞争者。在欧洲煤钢联营国家输出的一千万吨钢里面，西德占最大一部分，而法国每年平均输出一百八十万吨钢。为了保护自己对付西德的竞争，法国的钢铁垄断企业规定对进口钢抽税百分之十六。西德垄断企业也采取措施来保障他们的市场，对付法国的竞争。西德联邦议院在五月五日通过一个法案，授权政府把重工业产品进口税率从百分之六提高到百分之十二。
