    From the 2nd to the 10th, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions conducted a series of propaganda activities at the Working People's Cultural Palace to celebrate the opening of the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union of China in the capital. 400,000 people received propaganda and education.

    In the conference hall of the Cultural Palace, a photo exhibition of the Chinese workers' movement was held, exhibiting the portraits of more than 20 martyrs who gave their lives for the cause of the Chinese working class and the liberation of the Chinese people, and pictures illustrating several historical periods of the Chinese workers' movement. The Friendship Hall of the Cultural Palace displayed gifts presented by various parts of the country and other countries to the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union of China. Among these gifts were banners, vases, statues, movie projectors, radios, records, wooden utensils, etc., presented by trade union delegations from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, India, Indonesia, Burma, Australia, Africa, etc. A purple velvet banner presented by the Soviet trade union delegation was embroidered with twenty-six large characters: "Long live the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet people and the great Chinese people!"

    During the propaganda activities, the proceedings of the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union of China were broadcast to the park visitors through loudspeakers every day. Many workers, soldiers, and students sat beside the loudspeakers to listen.

    The Beijing Workers' Amateur Song and Dance Troupe often performed artistic performances at the Labor Theater of the Cultural Palace. On the evening of the 10th, these amateur artists also selected fifteen excellent song and dance programs to entertain the delegates and foreign guests attending the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union of China.

    Significant Achievements of Workers at the Wuhan Fourth Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Plant After Studying Science, Theory and Culture in Spare-Time Schools

    After a period of study of scientific theory and cultural knowledge in spare-time schools, the technical level and cultural literacy of the workers at the Wuhan Fourth Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Plant have improved significantly. The worker-students in the technical class of the plant's spare-time school can now understand general product blueprints. Some of the better performing students can draw relatively complex working sketches, calculate spur gears, and draw spur gears. After studying the theory of heat treatment, many workers have realized the importance of heat treatment operations and have further improved their operating methods, carefully controlling the temperature and speed during operation. They have also made great progress in cultural studies. Forty-nine people from the cultural classes have been admitted to spare-time middle schools. Many workers can now write short articles of three to four hundred words. Many workers who could not calculate multiplication and division in the past can now calculate decimals and fractions, and some can even calculate algebra. Workers in the accelerated literacy classes can now recognize more than 1,000 characters, and some of them can read books such as "The Story of Liu Zhidan." Now, when many workers put forward rationalization proposals, they not only provide written explanations, but also draw sketches. More than 90% of the total number of workers in the Fourth Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Plant participate in technical and cultural studies.

    Qinghai to Establish Dozens of Earth-House and Tent Elementary Schools on the Grasslands

    In order to gradually meet the learning needs of the Mongolian and Tibetan people in pastoral areas, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government will establish dozens of earth-house elementary schools and tent elementary schools on the grasslands this year. Before liberation, no ethnic schools had ever been established in Qinghai's pastoral areas. Last year, according to the demands of Tibetan thousand-household and hundred-household leaders, and Mongolian league chiefs and banner chiefs in pastoral areas, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government's Department of Culture and Education successively established 14 earth-house elementary schools and 14 tent elementary schools for Mongolians and Tibetans in pastoral areas, accommodating more than 1,300 students. Because these schools all selected local ethnic intellectuals to serve as teachers, used the local ethnic language for teaching, and the People's Government provided students with free books and some food expenses, the interest of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas in learning has been greatly increased. This year, the people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas generally requested the establishment of schools, but due to the lack of teachers of their own ethnic groups, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government can only plan to establish 54 earth-house and tent elementary schools in areas with suitable conditions this year, accommodating 3,800 students of all ethnic groups. In addition, in order to meet the needs of future cultural and educational work in pastoral areas, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government has specially established a pastoral area ethnic teacher training class at the Qinghai Normal School, specializing in training teachers from various ethnic minorities.

    Central South Region Holds Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Ethnic Minorities

    The "Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Ethnic Minorities in the Central South Region," which introduces the various ethnic minorities in the Central South Region, opened in Hankou on May 10.

    On display were many culturally significant historical relics of the ethnic minorities in the Central South Region. Guides from each ethnic group introduced these exhibits to the audience. Among them, the bronze drums of the Zhuang and Miao ethnic groups were relics from 2,000 years ago; the "Zhuang Brocade" curtain valances woven by Zhuang women with cotton yarn and colored thread, as well as the clothing embroidery of many ethnic groups, were all beautiful and exquisite handicrafts. In addition, there were many production tools and daily necessities made of wood, rattan, and thin bamboo, all carefully crafted by the people of the ethnic minorities. The exhibition also used many photos, charts, and historical materials to illustrate the extremely difficult lives that various ethnic minorities lived in the deep mountains under the cruel oppression of reactionary rulers in the past, and the freedom and happiness they have gained under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government after liberation.

    At the opening ceremony, Ye Jianying, Vice Chairman of the Central South Administrative Committee, Zhang Zhiyi, Director of the Central South Nationalities Affairs Committee, and others delivered speeches. Representatives of various ethnic minorities, students of various ethnic groups from the Central South Nationalities Institute, and people from all walks of life in Wuhan, totaling more than 1,500 people, attended the meeting.

    在文化宫的会议厅里，举办了中国工人运动图片展览，展出了为中国工人阶级和中国人民解放事业付出生命的二十多位先烈的遗像，和说明中国工人运动几个历史时期的图片。文化宫的友谊厅陈列了全国各地和各国赠给中国工会第七次全国代表大会的礼品。在这些礼品中，有苏联、朝鲜、越南、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古、德意志民主共和国、印度、印尼、缅甸、澳大利亚、非洲等工会代表团赠送的锦旗、花瓶、雕像、电影机、收音机、唱片、木雕器皿等。苏联工会代表团赠送的一幅紫绒锦旗，绣着二十六个大字：“苏联人民与伟大的中国人民之间永久的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    在宣传活动期间，中国工会第七次全国代表大会开会的情况，每天都通过扩音器向游园群众广播。很多工人、战士和学生都坐在扩音器旁收听。
    在文化宫的劳动剧场，北京市工人业余歌舞团经常作文艺演出。十日晚，这些业余的艺术工作者们，还选出十五个优秀的歌、舞节目，招待了出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表和外国来宾。
    武汉第四汽车制配厂工人在业余学校学习科学 理论和文化后，获得显著成绩
    武汉第四汽车制配厂工人在业余学校中经过一个时期的科学理论和文化知识的学习，技术水平和文化程度已有显著提高。该厂业余学校技术班的工人学员现在已能看懂一般的产品蓝图，有些成绩较好的学员已能画比较复杂的工作草图，计算正齿轮和绘制正齿轮。他们在学习了热处理的理论后，很多工人认识了热处理操作的重要性，并进一步改进了自己的操作方法，非常小心地控制温度及操作时的速度。他们在文化学习方面也有很大进步，全厂已有四十九人由文化班考进了业余中学。很多工人已能写三四百字的短文。过去很多不会算乘除法的工人，现在都能算小数及分数，个别的已能算代数了。速成识字班的工人，现在也能认识到一千多个单字，其中有些人已能看“刘志丹的故事”等书。现在许多工人在提出合理化建议时，不仅用文字说明，而且还画出草图。第四汽车制配厂参加技术和文化学习的工人达全厂工人总数百分之九十以上。
    青海将在草原上建立数十处土房和帐篷小学
    青海省人民政府为逐步满足牧区蒙、藏族人民的学习要求，今年将在草原上建立数十处土房小学和帐篷小学。青海牧区解放以前从未设立过民族学校。去年青海省人民政府文教厅根据牧区藏族千户、百户，蒙族盟长、旗长的要求，先后在牧区创办了蒙、藏族的土房小学和帐篷小学各十四处，收容学生一千三百多人。这些学校，由于都选用当地本民族的知识分子担任教师，用本民族的语文教学，以及人民政府免费供给学生书籍和一部分伙食费用等，大大提高了牧区各族人民学习的兴趣。今年，牧区各族人民普遍要求设立学校，但由于本民族教师缺乏，所以青海省人民政府今年只能在有条件的地区，计划先设立五十四处土房和帐篷小学，收容三千八百名各族学生。另外，为适应牧区将来开展文化教育工作的需要，青海省人民政府特在青海师范学校举办了牧区民族师资班，专门训练各少数民族的师资人材。
