Esteemed Delegates, Comrades!

    I extend my warm congratulations on the opening of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class, whether in the cause of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, in the cause of national construction, or on the front lines of the volunteer resistance against America and aid to Korea, has stood at the forefront of the struggle with unparalleled courage and unwavering will, contributed boundless wisdom and strength, continuously overcome difficulties, and produced countless male and female heroes and models, winning victories. These victories have brought about profound and fundamental changes in all aspects of Chinese society.

    In the three years since the national liberation, our country has achieved unprecedented national unity, the national economy that suffered destruction in the long war has been fully restored, and the people's democratic dictatorship has laid a solid foundation. In particular, the ranks of the working class have grown unprecedentedly and their leading position has been strengthened, which has created favorable conditions for our country to carry out long-term, planned, and large-scale national construction.

    As the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is held, a high tide of welcoming the three great tasks of 1953 is unfolding before our great motherland and great people. These are (1) to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist America and aid Korea; (2) to begin implementing the first Five-Year Plan for national construction; and (3) to convene the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels. Therefore, the convening of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is of even more special and important significance. I believe that, as in the past, it will play an important leading role in mobilizing the national working class to respond to the call of the state and implement the three great tasks.

    We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, the national working class will unite even more closely, rally under the great banner of Mao Zedong, strive to launch labor competitions, abide by labor discipline, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, learn advanced work methods, tap production potential, increase labor productivity, improve product quality, save raw materials, and reduce costs, and strive to complete and over fulfill the national construction plan. The national working class will actively participate in the elections of people's congresses at all levels, and, according to their own will, elect the best and necessary candidates to their own state power organs and local power organs, in order to strengthen the strength of the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship and the strength of national economic construction. Everyone knows that the cause of national economic construction is inseparable from the cause of defending world peace. Therefore, the national working class must unite even more closely with the working people of the whole country, continue to strengthen the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, consolidate national defense, defend the security and peaceful construction of the country, strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    Comrades! The three tasks before us are major and glorious. We have full confidence that we can victoriously complete these great and urgent tasks. Past experience has proven that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, are fully capable of achieving great and brilliant victories.

    Finally, I wish the congress a brilliant success.

    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通的祝词各位代表、各位同志！
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会开幕，我代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会表示热诚的祝贺。
    中国工人阶级在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，无论在中国人民解放斗争事业中，在国家建设事业中，和在志愿抗美援朝战线上，都曾以无比的英勇、坚强的意志，站在斗争的最前列，贡献了无穷的智慧和力量，不断地克服了困难，涌现出无数的男女英雄和模范，赢得了胜利。这些胜利已使整个中国社会的各方面都发生了深刻的根本的变化。
    在全国解放三年以来，我们的国家已实现了空前未有的人民的统一，在长期战争中遭受破坏的国家经济已经完全恢复，人民民主专政已奠定了巩固的基础，特别是工人阶级的队伍空前壮大，领导地位已经加强，这就替我们国家进行长期的、有计划的、大规模的国家建设创造了有利的条件。
    当此中国工会第七次全国代表大会举行之际，在我们伟大的祖国和伟大的人民面前正展开迎接一九五三年的三项伟大任务的高潮。这就是（一）继续加强抗美援朝的斗争；（二）开始执行国家建设的第一个五年计划；（三）召集全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会。因而中国工会第七次全国代表大会的召开，是更具有特殊重大意义的。我相信，一如过去一样，它将在动员全国工人阶级响应国家号召，执行三项伟大任务，起其重要的带头的作用。
    我们坚信，在中国工会第七次全国代表大会领导之下，全国工人阶级将更加团结起来，在伟大的毛泽东旗帜下，努力开展劳动竞赛，遵守劳动纪律，学习苏联的先进经验，学习先进的工作方法，挖掘生产潜力，提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，节约原料，减低成本，为完成和超额完成国家建设计划而奋斗。全国工人阶级将要积极参加各级人民代表大会的选举，按照自己的意志把自己认为是最好的和必要的人选到自己的国家政权机关和地方政权机关中去，以加强中国人民民主专政的力量和国家经济建设的力量。大家都知道，国家经济建设事业是与保卫世界和平事业分不开的，因此全国工人阶级要更加团结全国劳动人民，继续加强抗美援朝斗争，巩固国防，保卫国家的安全与和平建设，加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，保卫远东与世界的和平。
    同志们！摆在我们面前的三项任务，是重大的，也是光荣的。我们有充分信心可以胜利地完成这些伟大而迫切的任务。过去的经验证明：中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，是完全有力量能够取得伟大而光辉的胜利的。
    最后预祝大会获得辉煌的成功。
