Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th: "Democratic Korea" published a series of interviews on the 22nd with soldiers and junior officers of the Li Seung-man puppet army captured by our army. These interviews illustrated that the puppet soldiers were greatly discriminated against by the US military, and their morale was extremely low.

A Li pseudo-army soldier formerly belonging to the 3rd Battalion of the 31st Regiment of the US 7th Division said that the puppet soldiers incorporated into the US military units were subjected to extreme discrimination by the US military. US soldiers only stood guard during the daytime when combat operations were infrequent, while puppet soldiers were forced to stand guard at night, when attacks by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies were very active. On the front lines, due to the risk of being shot dead by snipers from the Korean and Chinese People's forces with the slightest carelessness, the US military forced the puppet soldiers to do the sentry duty, whether it was night or day. They themselves hid in relatively safe places and dared not move easily. In combat, the US military also often drove puppet soldiers to act as outposts, as cannon fodder for them. Therefore, many puppet soldiers hoped to suffer minor injuries in small battles and be sent to the rear to recuperate.

The puppet soldiers lived a life of starvation. They couldn't even drink vegetable soup casually, and they couldn't eat meat for months at a time. If any meat was distributed, it was all eaten by the officers. Even the small amount of supplementary food money rarely reached the soldiers' hands. A private second class from the former 17th Regiment of the 2nd Pseudo-Army, being unbearable hungry, stole food several times and was severely beaten several times. He said that the number of deserters in the puppet army due to hunger was increasing day by day.

The experiences of many puppet soldiers' families were very tragic. A second lieutenant officer from the captured 2nd Pseudo-Army said that in their unit, one soldier even encountered his young wife in the officers' "special comfort squad." It turned out that while he was shedding blood on the front line, the US-Li gang conscripted his wife into the "special comfort squad."

The captured puppet soldiers were very grateful for our side's lenient treatment of them. A puppet soldier formerly belonging to the 3rd Battalion of the 31st Regiment of the US 7th Division said: I suffered minor injuries when I was captured. In the US-Li army, minor injuries would not be treated as a matter of course. But in the Korean and Chinese side, I received unimaginable treatment and leniency in life.

### 被迫编入美军充当替死鬼  李伪军士气十分低沉

    被迫编入美军充当替死鬼
    李伪军士气十分低沉
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】“民主朝鲜”二十二日发表了一批被我军俘掳的李承晚伪军士兵和下级军官的谈话。这些谈话说明了伪军士兵备受美军歧视，伪军士气十分低沉。
    原属美军第七师三十一团三营的一个李伪军士兵说，被编入美军部队的伪军士兵，受着美军极大的歧视。美军士兵只在战斗行动很少的白天放哨，伪军士兵却被迫在朝中人民军队袭击行动十分活跃的夜间放哨。在前沿阵地上，由于一不小心就有被朝中人民部队狙击手打死的危险，不管黑夜或白天，放哨的事，美军一概逼着伪军士兵去干，他们自己却躲在比较安全的地方，不敢轻易出动。在战斗中，美军还经常驱使伪军士兵做前哨，为他们替死。因此，许多伪军士兵都希望能在小战斗中负点轻伤，退下火线到后方去。
    伪军士兵过的是饥饿的生活。连菜汤都不能随便喝，几个月也吃不上一次肉，有一点肉发下来，也都被军官们吃了。很少的一笔副食金，也往往到不了士兵们的手中。前伪军第二师十七团的一个二等兵因饥饿不堪，几次偷东西吃，曾挨了好几次毒打。他说，伪军中由于饥饿而逃亡的人也一天比一天多。
    很多伪军士兵家属的遭遇都非常悲惨。被俘的伪军第二师的一个少尉军官说，在他们部队里，有一个士兵在军官们的“特别慰安队”里竟碰到了他年轻的妻子。原来，当他在前线流血的时候，美李匪帮却把他的妻子征入“特别慰安队”里。
    被俘的伪军士兵都十分感激我方对于他们的宽待。原属美军第七师三十一团三营的一个伪军士兵说：我在被俘时曾负了轻伤。如在美李军方面，轻伤照例是不会受到医治的。但是在朝中方面我却受到了想像不到的治疗和生活上的宽待。
