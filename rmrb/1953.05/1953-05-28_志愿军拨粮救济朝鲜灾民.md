Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 27th: The Political Department and Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) recently jointly issued instructions to the entire army to provide relief to North Korean disaster victims and allocated 2 million catties of grain to various units to aid North Korean disaster victims.

The instructions stated: Due to the frantic destruction by the American aggressors, artificial disasters have been caused to the people in some areas of North Korea. In order to help the Korean people overcome difficulties, 2 million catties of grain have been specially allocated, to be distributed by various units through the local Korean government to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, refugees, and impoverished farmers in the vicinity of their garrisons who are experiencing difficulties.

Last year, the various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army implemented the higher authorities' instructions to "unite with and cherish the Korean people," saving more than 2.45 million catties of grain and a large amount of clothing to aid the Korean people in more than 30 counties in northern Korea.

    志愿军拨粮救济朝鲜灾民
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军政治部和后勤部于最近联合向全军发出救济朝鲜灾民的指示并拨出粮食二百万斤给各部队救济朝鲜灾民。
    指示中说：由于美国侵略者的疯狂破坏，给部分地区的朝鲜人民造成了人为的灾害。为帮助朝鲜人民克服困难，特拨出粮食二百万斤，由各部队通过当地的朝鲜政府，分配给驻地周围有困难的烈属、军属、难民以及贫苦农民等。
    中国人民志愿军各部队去年执行上级“团结和爱护朝鲜人民”的指示，曾节省粮食二百四十五万多斤和大批衣物，救济了朝鲜北部三十个郡（县）以上地区的朝鲜人民。
