Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: British public opinion continues to criticize the US for its delaying tactics in the Korean armistice negotiations.

    Former Economic Under-Secretary of the Treasury, Douglas Jay, said in a speech in Liverpool: "It would be a tragedy if the United Nations representatives lost the opportunity for an armistice in the Korean armistice negotiations because of excessive insistence on some minor issues. The British people want to see the war end." Former Labour Army Minister John Strachey also advocated an early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
      The "Manchester Guardian" commented on the 5th: "Part of the progress of the negotiations inevitably depends on the daily actions of the negotiators, which is why the rude tone in some of Harrison's speeches has caused anxiety. But even now, he is said to have told the Communist side that the time for negotiations is running out. What does this sentence mean? How can we withdraw from the meeting before the last chance to accept a compromise has disappeared?"

    英国舆论抨击美方拖延谈判
    【新华社七日讯】伦敦消息，英国舆论继续抨击美方在朝鲜停战谈判中的拖延态度。
    前英国政府财政部经济次官道格拉斯·贾埃在利物浦发表谈话说：“如果联合国方面的代表在朝鲜停战谈判中因为在若干次要问题上过分坚持而失去停战机会的话，那将是一个悲剧。英国人民愿意看到战争结束。”前工党陆军大臣约翰·斯特拉彻也主张早日和平解决朝鲜问题。
      “曼彻斯特卫报”在五日发表评论说：“谈判的进行有一部分必然取决于谈判人员逐日的行为，这就是为什么哈利逊的某些发言中的粗暴腔调已经引起人们的焦虑的原故。但是，即使在现在，据说他还告诉了共产党方面说，谈判的时间快要完了。这句话是什么意思？在接受妥协的最后一个机会还没有消失之前，我们如何能退出会场呢？”
