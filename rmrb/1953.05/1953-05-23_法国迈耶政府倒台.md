Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 22nd dispatch: The French Mayer government collapsed on the evening of the 21st. During a vote of confidence in the National Assembly on Mayer's "financial recovery" bill, the government was refused authorization to announce financial measures by administrative order by a vote of 328 to 244. The Mayer cabinet therefore resigned.

    The clause in the bill requesting Congress to grant the government the power to implement financial "reforms" had previously been rejected by the National Assembly's Finance Committee. Mayer then requested that the plenary session of the National Assembly pass it, threatening to resign and demanding a vote of confidence. But this could not save the fate of the Mayer government, which was trapped in a financial and economic predicament. Even many members of Mayer's own Radical Socialist Party and the "Independent Republican Peasant Union" and the "Union of Republicans and Social Action," breakaway members of the Gaullist party, who participated in the government, cast votes of no confidence.

    During the parliamentary discussion of the government's "financial recovery" bill, Georges Cogniot, the representative of the Communist Party's parliamentary group, emphasized: "The budget crisis, the financial anarchy, the stagnation of the national economy, and the encroachment on the freedom of citizens are all the result of our country's subordination to foreign capital since 1947. In order to eradicate the scourge, we must eliminate the root cause. France needs a government that implements a national democratic policy and that only serves the interests of France."

    法国迈耶政府倒台
    【新华社二十二日讯】巴黎消息：法国迈耶政府在二十一日傍晚倒台。国民议会就迈耶的“财政复兴”法案举行信任投票时，以三百二十八票对二百四十四票，拒绝授权政府以行政命令公布财政措施。迈耶内阁因而辞职。
    法案中关于要求国会授予政府以财政“改革”权力的条款，先此已在国民议会财政委员会遭否决。迈耶就要求国民议会全体会议加以通过，并以辞职相威胁，要求举行信任投票。但是这并不能挽救陷入财政经济绝境里的迈耶政府的命运。甚至迈耶自己的激进社会党以及参加政府的“独立共和农民联盟”和戴高乐党脱党分子“共和与社会行动联盟”的议员，都有很多人投了不信任票。
    在议会讨论政府的“财政复兴”法案时，共产党议会党团代表乔治·谷尼欧着重指出：“预算的危机，财政的无政府状态，国民经济的停滞以及对公民自由的进犯：全是我国从一九四七年以来从属于外国资本的结果。为了铲除祸害，必须消灭祸根。法国需要这样一个政府：这个政府要实行民族民主政策，它只服从法国的利益。”
