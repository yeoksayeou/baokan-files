Korean "Nodong Sinmun" and "Democratic Korea" Point Out
The Soviet Union's Peaceful Policies Align with the Interests of the World's People

    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 29th] The central organ of the Korean Workers' Party, "Nodong Sinmun," and the government organ of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, "Democratic Korea," both published editorials on the 27th, expressing agreement with and support for the analysis of the current international situation in the Soviet "Pravda" editorial of the 24th.
    The "Nodong Sinmun" editorial said: The Soviet Union, loyal to Stalin's peaceful policies, is demonstrating with practical actions its willingness to peacefully resolve international disputes and consolidate overall peace. The Soviet Union's consistent peaceful policy is concentratedly reflected in the Korean issue, which has become a touchstone for the foreign policies of various countries. A peaceful resolution of the Korean issue would be a great contribution to easing international tensions. The United States should prove its willingness for peace in Korea not with empty words but with practical actions. The ruling groups of the United States and Britain are talking about the current international issues, but they are avoiding mentioning issues related to China. British Prime Minister Churchill, like U.S. President Eisenhower, does not mention China in his speeches. The editorial pointed out: The new conspiracy of the Western three countries not only does not help to ease international tensions but will further worsen the international situation. The editorial said: The Soviet Union's peace-loving intention, as expressed in the "Pravda" editorial, fully conforms to the interests of all people and is warmly supported and welcomed by all peace-loving people.
    The "Democratic Korea" editorial said: The Soviet "Pravda" editorial correctly analyzes the current international situation and exposes the new conspiracy of the Western bloc. The "Pravda" editorial once again clearly shows who is truly seeking peace with practical actions and making unremitting efforts to quickly eliminate the current international tension. Undoubtedly, the "Pravda" editorial will inspire the people of the world who are eagerly concerned about and striving for overall peace.
European People's Democratic Countries' Newspapers Publish Comments
Praising the Soviet Union's Foreign Policy of Maintaining International Peace

    [Xinhua News Agency, May 29th] The "Pravda" editorial published on the 24th, entitled "On the Current International Situation," has been warmly welcomed by public opinion in Eastern European people's democratic countries. According to TASS news, newspapers in various people's democratic countries have published the "Pravda" editorial and have successively published comments praising and supporting the Soviet Union's foreign policy of maintaining international peace and security.
    The Polish "People's Tribune" wrote in an editorial entitled "For Peace and International Security": The Soviet leaders have recently made statements indicating that the Soviet Union is willing to resolve all disputed or outstanding international issues on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned. World opinion and the Polish people express heartfelt praise and support for these statements. These statements are a manifestation of the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful policy. "People's Tribune" pointed out that some of the points in Churchill's speech reflect the peaceful aspirations of the British people, and these points are welcomed by peace-loving people. The newspaper also pointed out Churchill's absurd stance on the German issue and expressed surprise that Churchill did not even mention the great Chinese people in his speech. "People's Tribune" concluded by saying that all peace-loving people hope that the constructive parts of Churchill's speech will be followed by concrete actions by the British government.
    Hungary's "Free People's Daily" emphasized in its commentary on the "Pravda" editorial: The Soviet Union is willing to resolve contentious issues through peaceful negotiations and has always hoped to strengthen peace. The people of the world all know that the issue of coordinating the security of the Soviet Union with the security of Western European countries can be resolved, and the Soviet Union's struggle for its security during World War II was also a struggle for the freedom and security of Western European countries. The Soviet Union's struggle to defend peace is also for the interests of the people of Western European countries. "Free People's Daily" said: The people of the whole world, including the Hungarian people, wholeheartedly support the struggle of the Soviet Union, China, and Korea for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. "Free People's Daily" believes that the resolution of the German issue is of utmost importance for consolidating peace. The newspaper finally emphasized that "Pravda's" commentary on Churchill's speech expresses the opinion of all progressive humanity.
    Czechoslovakia's "Labor Daily" pointed out: The "Pravda" editorial analyzes the complex international situation and very correctly clarifies the Soviet Union's position on the most important international issues. "Labor Daily" said: The road of conspiracy among three countries to oppose a fourth country's international politics cannot be the road to peace; such a road will only worsen international relations. The road to peace is action, not empty talk of peace used to disguise military action. As for the Soviet Union, its words and deeds are consistent. The capitalist countries must follow up their peaceful rhetoric with genuine peaceful actions.
    Bulgaria's "Fatherland Front" wrote: Our people have once again seen from the "Pravda" editorial the firm will of the Soviet people to strive for peace and international cooperation. The Bulgarian people believe that the Soviet Union's peaceful policy is a reliable guarantee for the victory of socialism in Bulgaria, a reliable guarantee for Bulgaria's national freedom and independence, and a reliable guarantee for the victory of the cause of world peace.
    Albania's "Voice of the People" pointed out: The Albanian people believe that the Soviet Union's peaceful policy is a guarantee for realizing their desire to maintain and consolidate world peace.
British, Indian, French, Swedish Newspapers
Emphasize the Soviet "Pravda" Editorial of the 24th

    [Xinhua News Agency, May 29th] TASS, London, May 28th: British newspapers attach great importance to the "Pravda" editorial entitled "On the Current International Situation."
    The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" said in an editorial: "We could not have hoped that the news of the tripartite Bermuda conference would have satisfied Moscow.... 'Pravda' strongly supported Churchill on two important issues. It welcomes the proposal for a high-level meeting and a gradual, detailed resolution of problems.... Even from a pessimistic point of view, this opinion is valuable for the resolution of certain problems, a resolution that may be suitable for Russia, but must also be equally, or even more, suitable for the West."
    This newspaper believes that the opinions expressed by "Pravda" on the German issue are "the most interesting part of the editorial," and "every word in this section has obviously been carefully considered."
    A reporter from the "Manchester Guardian" wrote: "Regarding the issues of Korea and Austria, the next step depends on the Western countries, and 'Pravda' is right to say this."
    Referring to the part of the "Pravda" editorial concerning the meeting of the leaders of the United States, Britain, and France, this reporter said that the purpose of "Pravda's" criticism of this matter "is only to express Russia's disapproval of the Bermuda conference, and it expressed this in strong terms. Therefore, it implies that if such a meeting is held, it will reduce the chances of reaching an agreement when the Soviet and Western leaders meet."
    The "Daily Herald" said in an editorial that a meeting of four leaders "certainly cannot resolve in detail the issues that divide East and West. However, it may change the atmosphere, so that these issues can be resolved peacefully and gradually in the future."
    "This hope is worth studying in detail. If such a meeting fails, it will be a very disappointing thing for countless men and women, old and young. But if such a meeting is not held, they will feel equally disappointed. Of course, it is possible for Russian and Western politicians to agree on such a simple approach: Let us not put forward all our demands for the time being, nor condemn each other for not being sincere. Let us see if there is a possibility of ending the Cold War through personal contact. Let us hold a meeting!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 29th] TASS, Delhi, May 28th: Indian newspapers commented on the front page of the May 26th issue on the "Pravda" editorial of May 24th. The "Hindustan Times" said in an editorial that the Soviet Union's doubts about the meeting of the three major powers are quite natural.
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 29th] According to TASS, Paris, May 28th: Parisian newspapers have widely commented on the "Pravda" editorial "On the Current International Situation." "L'Humanité" published the full text of the editorial. Bourgeois newspapers published summaries of the editorial with considerable length.
    All newspapers' headlines emphasized that "Pravda" opposes the Western three powers' intention to propose common preconditions on the issue of convening a Four Power conference.
    "Midi-Télévision" said: On the whole, it is not without reason that "Pravda" believes that the only purpose of holding the Bermuda three-country meeting is to consolidate the Western bloc. It believes that any attempt to strengthen this group is a means for the Western world to deal with the Kremlin.
    "Le Monde" said: "In the long editorial of 'Pravda' on May 24, the Soviet government condemned with a warning tone the tripartite conference to be held in Bermuda.... The 'Pravda' editorial... clearly stated that Moscow will never agree to hold a meeting dependent on demands proposed by the Western countries' prior conspiracy. If the Kremlin condemns the tripartite conference, it is only because it believes that such demands may be formulated after the meeting is held. It is precisely for this reason that the 'Pravda' article is clearly a serious warning to Western countries."
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 29th] TASS, Stockholm, May 28th: Local evening newspapers published excerpts of the "Pravda" editorial "On the Current International Situation" on the 25th. When commenting on the "Pravda" editorial, the newspapers criticized the Bermuda conference of the United States, Britain, and France. "Evening News" said in an editorial: The United States "attempts to use the upcoming three-country meeting to exert pressure." "Expressen" pointed out: There is no enthusiasm for the Bermuda conference in the West.

    各国重视“真理报”二十四日社论
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”“民主朝鲜”指出
    苏联和平政策符合世界人民利益
    【新华社平壤二十九日电】朝鲜劳动党中央机关报“劳动新闻”和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府机关报“民主朝鲜”都在二十七日发表社论，表示同意和支持苏联“真理报”二十四日社论对目前国际形势的分析。
    “劳动新闻”的社论说：忠实于斯大林和平政策的苏联，正以实际行动证明它自己关于和平解决国际纠纷、巩固全面和平的意愿。苏联始终不渝的和平政策，集中地表现在朝鲜问题上，这个问题已成为各国外交政策的试金石。朝鲜问题的和平解决，对于缓和国际紧张局势将是很大的贡献。美国应该不是以空话而是也以实际行动来证明它自己对于朝鲜和平的意愿。美英统治集团虽然在谈论着目前的国际问题，但是对有关中国的问题却避而不谈。英国首相邱吉尔也和美国总统艾森豪威尔一样，在演说中不提到中国。社论指出：西方三国举行会议的新的共谋，不仅丝毫无助于缓和国际紧张局势，反而会使国际局势更加恶化。社论说：“真理报”社论表明的苏联爱好和平的意愿，完全符合一切人民的利益，受到全体爱好和平的人民的热烈支持和欢迎。
    “民主朝鲜”的社论说：苏联“真理报”社论正确地分析了目前的国际形势，并且揭露了西方集团的新的共谋。“真理报”社论再一次明白地显示出：谁是真正以实际的行动来谋求和平，并为了迅速消除目前国际紧张局势而进行着不倦的努力。毫无疑问，“真理报”社论必将使迫切关心和争取着全面和平的全世界人民得到鼓舞。
    欧洲人民民主国家报纸发表评论
    赞扬苏联维护国际和平的外交政策
    【新华社二十九日讯】“真理报”二十四日发表的题为“关于目前的国际形势”的社论，受到东欧人民民主国家舆论的热烈欢迎。据塔斯社消息：各人民民主国家的报纸都刊载了真理报的社论，并纷纷发表评论，赞扬和支持苏联维护国际和平与安全的外交政策。
    波兰“人民论坛报”在题为“为了和平与国际安全”的社论中写道：苏联领袖们最近发表谈话，表示苏联愿意在有关各国共同协议的基础上，解决一切争执不下或悬而未决的国际问题。世界舆论与波兰人民对于这些谈话表示衷心的赞扬与支持。这些谈话是苏联的一贯的和平政策的表现。“人民论坛报”指出：邱吉尔演说中的一些论点反映了英国人民的和平愿望，这些论点受到爱好和平的人民的欢迎。该报同时指出邱吉尔在德国问题上采取的荒谬立场，并对邱吉尔在演说中甚至没有提到伟大的中国人民一节表示惊异。“人民论坛报”最后说：所有爱好和平的人民都希望邱吉尔演说中的建设性部分由英国政府继之以具体行动。
    匈牙利的“自由人民报”在评论“真理报”社论时强调说：苏联愿意通过和平谈判来解决争执不下的问题，始终希望加强和平。全世界人民都知道，苏联的安全与西欧国家的安全协调一致的问题是可以解决的，苏联在第二次世界大战期间为它安全所进行的斗争，也就是争取西欧国家的自由与安全的斗争。苏联为保卫和平进行的斗争，也是为了西欧各国人民的利益。“自由人民报”说：全世界人民、包括匈牙利人民在内，都衷心支持苏联、中国和朝鲜为和平解决朝鲜问题进行的斗争。“自由人民报”认为德国问题的解决对巩固和平具有极重要的意义。该报最后强调指出：“真理报”关于邱吉尔演说的评论，表达了全体进步人类的意见。
    捷克斯洛伐克“劳动报”指出：“真理报”社论分析了复杂的国际形势，并极为正确地阐明了苏联对最重要的国际问题采取的立场。“劳动报”说：三国共谋来反对第四个国家的国际政治阴谋的道路，不可能是走向和平的道路，这样的道路只会使得国际关系更加恶化。走向和平的道路是行动，而不是用来掩饰军事行动的和平空谈。至于苏联，它的言行是一致的。资本主义国家必须在它的和平论调之后继之以真正的和平行动。
    保加利亚“祖国阵线报”写道：我国人民从“真理报”的社论中，再一次看到苏联人民争取和平与国际合作的坚定意志。保加利亚人民认为苏联的和平政策是保加利亚社会主义胜利的可靠保证，是保加利亚的民族自由和独立的可靠保证，是世界和平事业胜利的可靠保证。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”指出：阿尔巴尼亚人民认为苏联的和平政策是实现他们维护与巩固世界和平的愿望的保证。
    英国、印度、法国、瑞典等国报纸
    重视苏联“真理报”二十四日社论
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：英国报纸非常重视“真理报”题为    “关于目前的国际形势”的社论。
    “每日电讯与晨邮报”在社论中说：“我们原不能希望三国举行百慕大会议的消息会使莫斯科满意。……‘真理报’在两个重要问题上有力地支持了邱吉尔。它欢迎召开高级会议和逐步地、细致地解决问题的建议……。即令从悲观的角度来看，这种意见对于某些问题的解决也是有价值的，这种解决可能对俄国适宜，但必然也同样，甚至更对西方适宜。”
    这家报纸认为“真理报”在论到德国问题时所发表的意见，是“社论中最使人感兴趣的部分”，“这一节中的每个字显然都是经过谨慎考虑的。”
    “曼彻斯特卫报”的一个记者写道：“关于朝鲜和奥地利问题，下一步要看西方国家，‘真理报’这话是说得有道理的。”
    这个记者在谈到“真理报”社论中关于美、英、法三国领袖举行会议的部分时说道，“真理报”批评这件事的目的“只在表示俄国不赞成百慕大会议，它用强硬的字句表示了这一点。因此，它暗示，如果要召开这种会议，就会减少苏联和西方领袖会晤时获致协议的机会。”
    “每日先驱报”在社论中说，四国领袖会议“当然不能细致地解决使东方和西方分裂的问题。然而它可能改变气氛，从而使这些问题可以在日后和平地、逐步地得到解决。”
    “这种希望是值得详细研究的。如果这样的会议失败了，这对于无数的男女老百姓来讲，将是一件非常令人失望的事情。但是如果不举行这样的会议，他们也会感到同样失望。当然，俄国和西方的政治家是可能彼此同意采取这样的简单方式的：让我们暂时不要提出所有的要求，也不要互相谴责对方没有诚意。让我们通过亲自接触来看一看是否有结束冷战的可能。让我们举行会议吧！”
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社德里二十八日讯：印度报纸二十六日在第一版评论“真理报”五月二十四日的社论。“印度斯坦时报”在社论中说，苏联对于三大国会议的疑虑，是十分自然的。
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：巴黎各报就“真理报”社论“关于目前的国际形势”广泛地发表评论。“人道报”刊载了社论全文。资产阶级报纸用相当篇幅刊载了社论的摘要。
    所有的报纸标题都强调指出，“真理报”反对西方三大国要在召开四大国会议的问题上提出共同的先决条件的打算。
    “米迪电讯报”说：整个说来，“真理报”认为召开百慕大三国会议的唯一目的便是要巩固西方集团，并不是没有理由的。它认为，任何加强这个集团的打算，都是西方世界对付克里姆林宫的一种手段。
    “世界报”说：“在五月二十四日的‘真理报’的长篇社论中，苏联政府带着警告的口气谴责了即将在百慕大举行的三大国会议。……‘真理报’社论……明白地表示，莫斯科决不会同意举行一个取决于西方国家预先共谋提出的要求的会议。假使克里姆林宫谴责三大国会议的话，这只是由于它认为举行这次会议后：可能会拟订这类要求。正是为了这个缘故，‘真理报’的文章显然是对西方国家所发出的严重警告。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十八日讯：此间晚报在二十五日摘要登载了“真理报”的社论：“关于目前的国际形势”。各报在评论
    “真理报”社论时，都批评美、英、法三国的百慕大会议。“新闻晚报”在社论中说：美国“企图利用即将举行的三国会议来行使压力”。“快报”指出：在西方，对百慕大会议是没有热情的。
