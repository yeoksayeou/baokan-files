Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Under the unified plan of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government, provinces and cities in North China have recently transported large quantities of grain to supply areas in need of grain, such as Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Grain departments in Hebei Province, Beijing, and Tianjin closely cooperated with railway transportation departments to complete the emergency transportation of a large quantity of grain in eight days in late April. Employees of the Tianjin Grain Company worked day and night to pack, weigh, and dispatch the grain in time to the grain-deficient areas. Grain departments in the grain-deficient areas also organized manpower and mobilized the masses to transport the grain from the unloading points in a timely manner. The transported grain included corn, sorghum, wheat, rice, and seed grain. In May, the provinces and cities in North China continued to transport grain. As of the 12th, Shanxi, Hebei, Suiyuan, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places had completed more than 55% of the monthly transportation task.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 16th: Henan Province is vigorously transporting large quantities of grain from other places and from the province's own reserves from railway lines and grain storage locations to various counties and towns in need of grain. Since late April, various localities in Henan Province have organized various transportation forces to participate in the work of transporting grain. On the highways for grain transportation, trucks carrying grain come and go continuously. On the Xu (Chang) - Nan (Yang) highway, more than 130 trucks and 1,400 rubber-wheeled carts were concentrated, transporting grain day and night. Chenliu and Weishi counties in the Zhengzhou area also organized three to four thousand handcarts and wheelbarrows to participate in the transportation. In order to do a good job in the transportation and receiving of grain, various localities have drawn cadres to establish transportation committees and set up temporary transportation stations. At present, large quantities of grain have been continuously transported to the grain-deficient areas.
