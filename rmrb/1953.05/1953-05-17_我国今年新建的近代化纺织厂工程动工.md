    Construction Begins on China's Newly Built Modern Textile Factory Project This Year

    This year, China will begin construction on four modern, large-scale state-owned textile factories in Beijing, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, and Harbin, as well as two flax raw material plants. The preliminary designs for these factories have been completed, and large quantities of building materials, such as steel, bricks, stone, cement, and timber, have been continuously shipped to the construction sites. Preparations for construction are largely complete. Construction has already begun on three new textile factories in Beijing, Zhengzhou, and Shijiazhuang, and two flax raw material plants near Harbin. Construction on the Xi'an textile factory is expected to begin at the end of this month.

    The four new textile factories are all large in scale, with a construction area of approximately 90,000 square meters each, totaling approximately 350,000 square meters for all four factories. The construction of these textile factories is designed by China itself. Except for the Beijing textile factory, which is ordering machinery from the German Democratic Republic, the machinery and equipment for all other factories are textile machines manufactured by China itself. These machinery and equipment are modern. For example, the weaving sections of each factory are prepared to install a large number of automatic looms, with each weaver able to manage about twenty to thirty looms. All four textile factories have complete safety devices to fully protect the health of workers from harm. Ventilation, spraying, heaters, and radiators are universally installed in the workshops, and vacuum cleaners are installed above and below the machines in each workshop to remove the plant fibers and dust flying in the workshop, so that the air in the workshop is always kept clean. The two flax raw material plants are also large in scale, with a total construction area of more than 34,600 square meters. All the machinery is the latest automatic machinery from the Soviet Union, and the two factories can produce 1,800 tons of flax raw materials per year. In addition to the factory buildings, the construction projects for these factories also include a large number of family dormitories and single dormitories, nurseries, clubs, clinics, schools for children, bathrooms, gardens, and other facilities, which are all quite complete.

    These textile factories and flax raw material plants are all located in the cotton and hemp production centers of China. The factories can obtain raw materials locally for production, which saves a lot of transportation costs and reduces costs. The four textile factories and two flax raw material plants can be officially put into production one after another next year. In the past three years, China has successively built six large-scale modern state-owned textile factories in Zhengzhou, Xianyang, Handan, Dihua, Wuhan, and Harbin. Now, with the construction of these new factories, it marks that China's textile industry is becoming increasingly strong and developing.

    我国今年新建的近代化纺织厂工程动工
    我国今年将在北京和西安、郑州、石家庄、哈尔滨等地新建四座现代化的、规模巨大的国营纺织厂和两座亚麻原料厂，这些厂的初步设计已经完成，建筑所需要的大批材料，如钢骨、砖、石、水泥、木材等，都已源源运抵工地。施工前的各项准备工作，都已大体就绪。北京、郑州、石家庄的三个新建纺织厂和哈尔滨附近的两个亚麻原料厂都已开始施工，西安纺织厂本月底就可开始施工。
    这四个新建的纺织厂的规模都很庞大，每个厂的建筑面积约九万平方公尺，四个厂合计约三十五万平方公尺。这几个纺织厂的建设都由我国自己设计，厂的机器设备除北京纺织厂系订购的德意志民主共和国的机器外，其余各厂全部是我国自己制造的纺织机械。这些机器设备都是近代化的，例如各厂织造部分准备装置大量自动布机，这种布机每个织布工人可以管理二十台至三十台左右。四个纺织厂都有完善的安全装置，充分地保护工人们的健康不受损害；工场内普遍装设通风、喷雾、加热器、放热器等设备，每个车间的机器上下都安装吸尘器，以便把车间里飞扬的植物纤维和灰尘都抽出去，使得车间里的空气经常保持清洁。两个亚麻原料厂的规模也很大，建筑面积共达三万四千六百多平方公尺，全部是来自苏联的最新式的自动化机器，两个厂一年可生产亚麻原料一千八百吨。这几个工厂的建设工程除厂房以外，还要建筑大批眷属宿舍和单人宿舍、托儿所、俱乐部、诊疗室、子弟学校、浴室、花园等，设备都相当完备。
    这几个纺织厂和亚麻原料厂都在我国的产棉、产麻中心区，工厂可以就地取得原料进行生产，这就节省了大量运输费用，减低了成本。这四个纺织厂和两个亚麻原料厂在明年就可以先后正式开工生产。我国三年来已先后在郑州、咸阳、邯郸、迪化、武汉、哈尔滨等地新建了六座规模很大的近代化的国营纺织厂，现在又新建这几座厂，这标明我国的纺织工业正在日益强大和发展起来。
