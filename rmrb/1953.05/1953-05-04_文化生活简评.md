Brief Comments on Cultural Life

Improving Illustrations and Cover Designs for Literary Books

China's book illustration art was originally very developed. Novels and plays of the Ming and Qing dynasties almost always had one or several illustrations. Moreover, because many famous painters participated in the work of drawing drafts at that time, many exquisitely drawn and engraved works were produced. Since the introduction of advanced Western printing technology, China's inherent illustration art has instead been neglected and gradually declined. General new literary books rarely have illustrations printed.

In recent years, some literary periodicals and literary books have begun to print illustrations, and some works, such as Shao Yu's illustrations for "Thousands of Mountains and Rivers," have been well received by readers. However, the artistic quality of general illustrations is very poor. The depictions appear crude and simple, with little artistic processing, and the characters are stiff and lack vivid expressions. Such works cannot help to improve the clarity of literary images and enhance the power of textual descriptions. The fundamental reason for the backwardness of illustration art is that artists do not pay enough attention to illustration work. To change this situation, it is necessary to first correct the artists' incorrect view that illustration is only a description of the life experienced by others (writers), and therefore they are not free in their creation. Although illustrators must understand life through literary works, it is more important that the painters themselves should have their own understanding and feelings about the life expressed in the literary works. Illustration, like other paintings, is an art in which writers can freely exert their creativity and fully express their talents.

The situation of cover design for literary books is similar to that of illustrations, and the level is very low. Common cover designs often only involve printing the title in Song typeface on white paper or paper printed with background colors and continuous patterns, and that's it. The decorations on the cover are mostly irrelevant to the content and nature of the book. The widespread use of folk window grilles and ethnic patterns is a prominent example. Recently, even the cover of "China Youth" magazine has adopted that flat, ancient pattern. Window grilles and patterns have almost become the designers' panacea. Some have combined with the content of the book, such as printing photos as covers, but this, like the abuse of window grilles and patterns, is a bad habit of taking shortcuts, being lazy, and lacking creativity. Good cover designs are attractive to readers. "Liberation Army Literature and Art" has been well received by readers for using color paintings reflecting the life of the army in each issue.

Publishing and editing work play a significant role in the development of book illustrations and cover designs. However, most publishers and editors do not pay enough attention to this work. For example, illustrations are printed too small and are blurry, and sometimes even the author's name is not printed. The paper quality and printing conditions of the covers are also very poor, which also limits the creative enthusiasm of illustrators and designers.

Publishing institutions should jointly study with artists how to improve book illustrations and cover designs to meet the aesthetic needs of readers.

    文化生活简评
    改进文学书籍的插图和封面设计
    我国的书籍插图艺术，本来很发达，明清的小说和剧本几乎都有一种或数种插图；而且，由于当时许多名画家参加了画稿的工作，曾产生了不少绘刻精美的作品。自从进步的西洋印刷术传入后，我国固有的插图艺术却反而不受重视而逐渐衰落了。一般新文艺书籍，很少有刊印插图的。
    近年来有些文学期刊和文学书籍已开始刊印插图，并且有的作品，如邵宇的“千山万水”的插图，得到了读者的好评。但一般的插图的艺术质量很差，在描写上显得粗劣、简单，很少艺术加工，人物呆板，缺乏生动的表情。这样的作品，不可能有助于提高文学形象的明确性和增强文字描写的力量。插图艺术所以如此落后，美术家不重视插图工作是基本原因。要改变这种情况，应当首先端正美术家的不正确的看法：以为插图只是描写别人（文学家）所体验的生活，因而在创作上是不自由的。插图画家虽然必须通过文学作品去理解生活，但更重要的画家本人对文学作品所表现的生活也应有自己的认识和感情。插图和其它绘画同样是作家可以自由发挥创造性，充分表现自己的才能的艺术。
    目前文学书籍封面设计的情况，也与文学书籍插图差不多，水平很低。常见的封面设计，往往只是在白的或印有底色和连续图案的纸上，印上宋体字的书名就算了事。封面的装饰，大都与书的内容、性质不相干。到处搬用民间窗花和民族形式的纹样便是一个显著的例子。最近连“中国青年”杂志的封面也采用那平板、古老的纹样了。窗花和纹样几乎成了设计者的万灵丹。有的曾与书的内容结合，如印上照片作封面，但这与滥用窗花和纹样，同样是一种取巧、偷懒而缺乏创造性的坏习气。好的封面设计，对于读者是具有吸引力的，“解放军文艺”因每期采用反映部队生活的彩色画，受到了读者的欢迎。
    出版工作和编辑工作对书籍插图和封面设计的发展，是有很大作用的，然而一般出版者和编辑者，还不很重视这个工作。例如把插图印得太小，模糊不清，有的竟连作者的姓名也不印上；封面的纸张质量和制版印刷条件都很差，这些也限制了插图作者和设计者的创作热情。
    出版机构应与美术家共同研究如何改进书籍插图和封面设计，以满足读者的美术上的需要。
