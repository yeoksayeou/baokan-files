Learning from Soviet Experts in Revising Teaching Syllabi
    Zheng Linqing, Head of the Mechanical Design Teaching and Research Group, Department of Mechanical Manufacturing, Tsinghua University

    Tsinghua University revised the teaching syllabi for all courses in early March this year. In the process of revising the teaching syllabus for Machine Parts, we received assistance from Soviet expert Comrade Dementiev, which not only allowed us to complete the task of revising the teaching syllabus but also taught us correct teaching methods.

    The Machine Parts course is offered to second-year students majoring in Metalworking and Foundry in the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing, as well as Automotive Engineering in the Department of Power Machinery, and spans two semesters. Last semester, we taught this course to third-year students and developed a teaching syllabus when the Teaching and Research Group was established last summer. We also summarized experiences in solving certain problems segment by segment during teaching. Therefore, when the school administration proposed revising the teaching syllabus, we initially thought we already had experience and did not pay much attention to this task. It was not until the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing discussed the principles for revising the curriculum syllabus that we changed this incorrect idea and began the work seriously.

    In the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing, some teachers lectured on Soviet textbooks that they themselves did not fully understand, and the results were not good. Based on this situation, we proposed the first principle for revising the teaching syllabus: the content included in the curriculum syllabus should be "what the teacher can teach and the student can understand."

    The work of revising the teaching plans for all majors in February profoundly educated us. We deeply knew that the revision of the teaching syllabus must be combined with the purpose of the major to reflect the spirit of the teaching plan, which also became a principle. In his report at the reporting meeting on revising the teaching plan, Principal's Advisor Comrade Sadovich emphasized that general universities in China must achieve the teaching goals that Soviet higher education institutions aim to achieve in five years within four years. Therefore, we must pay special attention to the amount of teaching material and avoid excessive content. For example, in the Machine Parts course for third-year students last semester, the lecture notes were nearly 500 pages long, making it difficult for students to read all of them carefully, which was not acceptable. Therefore, we proposed another principle: the teaching syllabus should include the most basic and essential content.

    Finally, considering that there are often repetitions or disconnections between courses, we proposed a fourth principle: to closely coordinate with related courses. Speaking of course repetition and disconnection, it was particularly serious in the teaching before the reorganization of colleges and departments. A mechanical engineering student could repeatedly hear about the composition of screw threads in five courses: engineering drawing, metalworking practice, principles of machinery, machine design, and manufacturing methods, but no course mentioned screw tolerances.

    Based on these four principles, we examined the past teaching syllabus and found that there were indeed many shortcomings. Therefore, the Teaching and Research Group carried out four tasks according to the above four principles: first, understanding students' past learning situation, investigating the general level of students in each class, and understanding the percentage of particularly good and particularly bad students in each class and the disparity; second, contacting relevant teachers. This was of great help to the work of revising the teaching syllabus. For example, in the "Foundation of Parts Design" chapter in the past, a lot of material mechanics content was taught. After contacting relevant teachers, we learned that the material mechanics course had thoroughly covered the theory of material failure, stress concentration, and other issues in the previous semester. Therefore, the content of the past five class hours can be reviewed in one and a half class hours this year; third, conducting in-depth discussions on the role of the Machine Parts course in the teaching plans of the three majors. As a result of the discussion, everyone believed that Machine Parts was one of the important courses for the three majors of Mechanical Manufacturing and Automotive Engineering; and the series of courses "Principles of Machinery - Machine Parts - Lifting and Transporting Machinery" was an important support for the three majors. In the teaching plan, Machine Parts plays the role of connecting the preceding and following courses. For example, in the Metalworking major, it is necessary to learn the design of metal cutting machine tools, which requires sufficient knowledge of parts design; and to learn the Machine Parts course, it is necessary to use theoretical mechanics, material mechanics, metalworking, engineering drawing, principles of machinery, and metal materials as the basis; fourth, checking the past course content. In this work, we paid special attention to distinguishing what is the main teaching material and what is the secondary teaching material. For example, we believed that the teaching materials on keyway connections, spherical worm gears, pipes, and joints were secondary and planned to delete them; and the bearing load analysis of helical bevel gears will be discussed in detail in the automotive professional course, so we decided to delete it as well. The purpose of doing this is to allocate enough time to focus on explaining key issues.

    After these preparations were completed, we drafted the first draft of the teaching syllabus.

    After carefully reading this first draft of the teaching syllabus, Comrade Dementiev raised some opinions. His opinions can be roughly divided into three parts: the first is about political ideology, the second is about the purpose of the course, and the third is about how to solve some specific difficult problems.

    Comrade Dementiev believed that the political ideology of the entire teaching syllabus was not strong. He proposed:

    First, to implement Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought into the teaching syllabus. Second, to elaborate on the status of this course in China's political economy. Include the government's decisions and instructions related to this course in the syllabus. Third, the teaching syllabus should reflect the characteristics of China's political, economic, and cultural features. Fourth, it should mention the history of the development of this discipline in China—the contributions and works of scholars, engineers, and advanced workers in Chinese scientific research institutions, schools, and factories in this field. Fifth, it should explain the situation of the imperialist aggression policies of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and other countries that have hindered the development of China's economy, technology, and culture for a long time; at the same time, explain the role of Soviet assistance in the development of our country's economy, technology, and culture.

    The lack of political ideology is indeed the biggest shortcoming of the first draft of the teaching syllabus. According to our current ideological level, it is certainly difficult to achieve this; but this difficulty is not insurmountable. The reason why the syllabus is so lacking in political ideology is mainly because we have not paid enough attention to this point.

    Comrade Dementiev mentioned that the long-term devastation of imperialism has hindered the development of China's technical science, which quickly reminded me of the backwardness of China's machine manufacturing industry before liberation. At that time, smaller factories only did some parts work, and larger factories could only copy the styles of some foreign machines for manufacturing, and there was no large-scale design at all. The design specifications were very chaotic, with American, British, German, and Japanese standards. This precisely illustrates the characteristics of a semi-colonial industry. However, only three years after the national liberation, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we have begun to build factories on a large scale. It is indeed very necessary to include such materials in the teaching syllabus.

    I usually do not pay enough attention to Chinese engineering historical materials. In fact, Liu Xianzhou's "Historical Materials of Chinese Mechanical Engineering" and "Tiangong Kaiwu" are good reference materials. If these historical materials can be placed in appropriate chapters, they will be good teaching materials for conducting patriotic education.

    Soviet experts also said that we must pay great attention to Chairman Mao's call to learn from the Soviet Union. In the upcoming Five-Year Economic Construction Plan, all instructions related to the design aspects of the machinery manufacturing industry and the automobile tractor manufacturing industry can be used as teaching materials. In teaching, we can also contact economic accounting, work quotas, worker safety, etc., at any time to educate students, so that they can establish a comprehensive economic perspective in the design and pay attention to the working conditions of workers at any time... Only in this way can we cultivate qualified engineers for New China.

    In order to effectively solve the problem of the purpose of the course, Soviet experts put forward the following points: 1. The course content needs to maintain comprehensiveness and needs to have emphasis; 2. In order to cultivate students' independent working ability, it is necessary to pay attention to inspiration; 3. The course content needs to focus on reflecting professional characteristics; 4. Delete unnecessary excess theoretical materials.

    It is very necessary to keep the course content comprehensive and have emphasis. In the past, we did not understand this point enough, so when drafting the first draft of the teaching syllabus, we deleted a lot of important materials, thus destroying the comprehensiveness and systematicness of this discipline. In order to train qualified engineers, it is not only necessary to enable students to learn the design of certain main parts, but more importantly, to enable them to comprehensively and systematically study the subject of "Machine Parts". Therefore, students must be introduced to some new developments in this discipline and its development directions at any time. For example, the development of stepless transmission, the theory of high-pressure lubrication, etc., should be introduced to students. However, under the principle of maintaining comprehensiveness, teaching must have emphasis to clearly reflect the characteristics of the profession. Comrade Dementiev said: "A topic can be talked about in a few words, or it can be talked about for two hours, it depends on what the requirements of this profession are." The guidance of Soviet experts changed my previous misconception that "emphasis and comprehensiveness cannot be achieved at the same time." In the past, I always thought that every topic in the teaching syllabus must be explained in detail, and chapter by chapter, section by section, and word by word according to the lecture notes, and I did not understand that the result of teaching in this way would inevitably lose the emphasis.

    Due to insufficient understanding of the training goals, I made the following mistakes in teaching: more emphasis on imparting knowledge than on inspiration. The teaching syllabus drafted under my leadership in the past clearly illustrates this point, with far more explanations about calculations than explanations about structures. Although students trained in this way can solve exercises, they may not be able to independently solve design problems. Although students can be familiar with the application of gear formulas, if they do not understand the structure of gears and their devices well enough, they still cannot perfectly design gear transmission devices.

    Soviet experts emphasized the importance of the teaching syllabus reflecting professional characteristics. We also repeatedly discussed the training goals of the three majors and the position and role of the Machine Parts course in the teaching plans of the three majors when preparing to revise the teaching syllabus. However, the first draft of the syllabus still cannot clearly reflect the professional characteristics, and it often contains ambiguous content. This is mainly because I failed to implement the principle that the teaching syllabus must reflect professional characteristics in teaching. For example, in class, I often consciously or unconsciously talked about some unnecessary theories. This is meaningless to students' learning.

    Because the study period is four years, every course encounters the problem of "too much content and not enough time," and the Machine Parts course is no exception. However, if we can conduct research realistically and seriously, this problem can be solved. Our solution to this problem is: 1. Redistribute teaching time; 2. Make the Machine Parts course more closely coordinated with related courses; 3. Appropriately arrange the order of lectures; 4. Temporarily delete certain chapters in response to the situation of this class.

    From this year, the "Machine Parts" will be brought forward one semester in the teaching plan, and some prerequisite foundation courses will be studied at the same time as this course. Therefore, the close coordination between the courses is even more necessary. For example, in order to cooperate with the material mechanics course, we moved the chapter "Removable Connections" back; "Screw" and "Connecting Screws" are taught in the same chapter; the bearing load analysis of helical bevel gears is incorporated into the automotive professional course... This can solve many difficult problems. Comrade Dementiev also analyzed the content of the teaching materials and the topics of course design. We felt that the design topics were relatively easy, so we suggested reducing the design hours from fifty-four to forty-eight, and increasing the lecture hours from seventy-six to eighty-two (the total number of hours in the course is still the same). We also considered that the study time this semester is shorter than the normal study time. After analyzing the situation of each major, we decided to temporarily delete the chapter "Crankshaft" and leave it to the professional course (but this is only a temporary measure for this year).

    After completing the revision of the teaching syllabus, I read the new and old teaching syllabi in comparison again. Although some programs look the same, the weight is different. I am familiar with every item, as if I have a grasp of the teaching materials and teaching methods. Comrade Dementiev said: "... If it is found in teaching that there is a phenomenon of advance or lag in the progress, which is not in line with the teaching calendar, you can calmly weigh the importance of the content and make appropriate adjustments." This is correct.

    Through this revision of the teaching syllabus, I realized that in order to do a good job in revising the teaching syllabus, we must first clearly understand the purpose of teaching and must pay attention to political and ideological education, and then, in combination with the specific situation, closely cooperate with all parties and make appropriate adjustments to the teaching materials. What is particularly important is to embody the principles in the syllabus. It is impossible to do a good job if we only talk about principles without linking them to reality.

    在修改教学大纲的工作中向苏联专家学习
    清华大学机械制造系机械设计教研组主任  郑林庆
    清华大学在今年三月初旬修改了全校各课程的教学大纲。我们在修改机器零件教学大纲的过程里，得到苏联专家杰门节夫同志的帮助，不仅完成了修改教学大纲的任务，而且学到了正确的教学方法。
    机器零件这门课程，是为机械制造系金工、铸工两专业和动力机械系汽车工程专业的二年级学生开设的，全课程共占两学期。上学期我们曾为三年级开过这门课程，并且在去年暑假教研组成立之初制订过这门课程的教学大纲，在教学中也曾逐段总结了解决某些问题的经验，所以在学校行政方面提出要进行修改教学大纲的工作时，最初我们自以为已有经验，并未重视这项工作。直到机械制造系讨论了修改课程大纲的原则以后，才改变了这种不正确的想法，认真地开始了这项工作。
    在机械制造系里曾有个别教师把自己还未懂得透彻的苏联教材讲授给同学听，效果很不好。根据这种情况，我们提出了修改教学大纲的第一项原则：课程大纲所包括的内容应该是“先生能教，学生能懂”的。
    二月份全校修改各专业教学计划的工作深刻地教育了我们，我们深知修改教学大纲必须结合专业的目的性，才能体现教学计划的精神，这也就成为一项原则。校长顾问萨多维奇同志在修订教学计划报告会上的报告，着重指出我国一般大学要在四年内达到苏联高等学校五年所要达到的教学目的，所以必须特别注意教材的分量，切忌过多。像上学期三年级机器零件一课，讲义几近五百页，同学很难全部精读，这是不行的。因此我们又提出这样的原则：教学大纲要包括最基本最主要的内容。
    最后又鉴于各课程常有重复或脱节的地方，所以提出第四项原则：要和有关的课程密切配合。说到课程的重复和脱节，在院系调整以前的教学中尤为严重，一个机械系的学生可以在工程画、金工实习、机械原理、机械设计和制造方法等五门课程中重复地听到关于螺丝纹构成的讲述，但是关于螺丝公差，却没有一门课程提起过。
    根据这四项原则，我们检查了过去的教学大纲，觉得缺点确实很多。于是教研组根据上述的四项原则进行了四项工作：第一，了解学生过去的学习情况，调查各班学生的一般程度，并了解成绩特别好和特别坏的学生在各班的百分比及其悬殊情况。第二，和有关教师联系。这对修改教学大纲的工作是有很大帮助的。譬如往年在“零件设计的基础”一章里，曾讲授了很多关于材料力学的内容。在和有关教师联系以后，知道材料力学一课在上学期已经把材料破坏理论、应力集中等问题讲得很透彻。因此过去五节课的内容，今年可以在一节半课的时间内复习完毕。第三，对机器零件这门课程在三个专业的教学计划里所起的作用问题，进行深入的讨论。讨论结果，大家认为对机械制造和汽车工程三个专业来说，机器零件是重要课程之一；而“机械原理——机器零件——起重运输机械”这一系列的课程，则是三专业的重要支架。在教学计划里，机器零件具有着衔接前后课程的作用。譬如在金工专业里，要学习金属切削机床的设计，必须具有足够的关于零件设计的知识；而要学习机器零件这门课程，又必须以理论力学、材料力学、金属工学、工程画、机械原理，以及金属材料等等课程作为基础。第四，检查过去的课程内容。在这项工作中，我们特别注意区分什么是主要的教材，什么是次要的教材。比如，我们认为关于楔联接、球面蜗轮、管子和接头的教材是次要的，就打算把它删掉；而曲齿锥齿轮的轴承载荷分析，将在汽车专业课程里详细论述，我们也就决定把它删掉。我们所以这样作，其目的在于匀出足够的时间来集中地讲解重点问题。
    这些准备工作完成以后，我们便拟订出了教学大纲的初稿。
    对于这个教学大纲初稿，杰门节夫同志在仔细阅读以后，曾提出了一些意见。他的意见大体上可以分作三部分：第一是关于政治思想性方面的，第二是关于课程目的性方面的，第三是关于如何解决一些具体困难问题的。
    杰门节夫同志认为，整个教学大纲的政治思想性是不强的。他提出：
    第一，要把马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想贯彻到教学大纲里去。第二，要阐述这门课程在中国政治经济上的地位。把政府颁布的和本课程有关的决定、指令列入大纲。第三，教学大纲应该反映出中国政治经济文化的特点。第四，应该提到这门学科在中国发展的历史——中国科学研究机关、学校和工厂里的学者、工程师以及先进工作者在这方面的贡献和著作。第五，应该说明英、美、日等帝国主义的侵略政策在长时间内阻碍中国经济、技术、文化的发展的情况；同时说明苏联的帮助对我国经济、技术、文化发展所起的作用。
    缺乏政治思想性，这确实是教学大纲初稿的最大缺点。按我们目前的思想水平来说，要作到这一点当然是有困难的；但这种困难并不是不能克服的。大纲所以如此缺乏政治思想性，主要由于我们对这一点重视不够。
    杰门节夫同志提到帝国主义的长期蹂躏，阻碍了中国技术科学的发展，这使我很快地联想到我国解放前机器制造工业的落后情况。那时，规模小些的工厂只是做些配件的工作，规模较大的工厂也只能抄袭着一些外国机器的式样进行制造，根本谈不上大规模的设计。设计规格十分紊乱，有美、英的，也有德、日的。这正说明着半殖民地工业的特点。但是全国解放仅只三年，在苏联大公无私的帮助下，我们已经开始大规模地建厂。把这样的材料列入教学大纲，确实是十分必要的。
    对于中国工程史料，我平日不够重视。其实，刘仙洲著“中国机械工程史料”和“天工开物”等都是很好的参考资料。如果能够把这些史料安插到适当的章节里去，便是进行爱国主义教育的良好教材。
    苏联专家又说，对于毛主席所提出的学习苏联的号召必须十分重视。将来要颁布的五年经济建设计划里，凡是和机械制造业、汽车拖拉机制造业设计方面有关的指示，都可以当作教材。在教学中还可以随时联系到经济核算、工时定额、工人保安等等问题，以便教育学生，使他们建立在设计中的全面经济观点，随时注意工人的劳动条件……。只有这样，才能培养出合乎规格的新中国工程师。
    为了切实解决课程的目的性问题，苏联专家提出下列几点意见：一、课程内容既需要保持全面性又需要有重点。二、为了培养学生的独立工作能力，必须注重启发。三、课程内容需要着重地反映专业特点。四、删除不必要的多余的理论材料。
    要使课程内容保持全面性，而且又有重点，这是十分必要的。过去，我们对这一点理解不够，以致在拟定教学大纲初稿时，删除了不少重要的材料，因而破坏了这门学科的全面性和系统性。为了培养合格的工程师，不仅需要使学生学会某些主要零件的设计，更重要的是使他们能够全面地有系统地研究“机器零件”这门学问，因此必须随时向学生介绍有关这门学科的一些新的发展及其发展的方面。例如无级传动的发展情况、高压润滑理论等，都应介绍给学生。但是在保持全面性的原则下，教学要有重点，以显明地反映专业的特点。杰门节夫同志说：“一个题目可以用几句话讲过去，也可以讲两个钟头，这就要看这个专业的要求是怎样的了。”苏联专家的指导，改变了我以前“重点和全面性不可得兼”的错误看法。过去，我总以为教学大纲里的每一题目都必须讲述得详详细细，按照讲义逐章逐节、逐句逐字地进行讲述，不懂得这样教的结果必然会失去重点。
    由于对培养目标认识得不够清楚，我在教学中犯了下列的错误：灌输多于启发。过去在我的主持下拟定的教学大纲就很明显地说明了这一点，关于计算的讲解远多于结构的讲解。这样训练出来的学生虽然能够解算习题，但不一定能够独立解决设计的问题。尽管学生能够熟悉于计算齿轮公式的运用，但如果他对齿轮及其装置的结构了解不够，仍然不能够完善地设计齿轮传动装置。
    苏联专家十分强调教学大纲反映专业特点之重要。我们在进行修改教学大纲的准备工作时也曾反复地讨论了三个专业的培养目标，以及机器零件这门课程在三个专业教学计划中所占的地位和所起的作用。但是大纲初稿仍然不能显明地反映出专业的特点，里面常掺有模棱两可的内容。这主要因为自己未能把教学大纲必须反映专业特点的原则贯彻到教学里去。譬如在讲课中，我往往有意识地或无意识地讲一些不必要的理论。这对于学生的学习是没有意义的。
    因为学习期限是四年，每门课程都遇到“内容太多，时间不够”的问题，机器零件这门课程也不例外。但是，如果我们能实事求是地认真地进行研究，这个问题是可能得到解决的。我们解决这个问题的办法是：一、重新分配教学时间；二、使机器零件这门课程更密切地和有关课程配合；三、适当地安排讲课次序；四、针对本班的情况，暂时删除某些章节。
    从今年起，教学计划中将“机器零件”提前了一个学期，有些先修基础课程都和本课同时修习，因此各课程之间的密切配合更属必要。譬如为了配合材料力学课，我们把“可拆卸联接”一章移后；“螺旋”和“联接螺丝”放在同一章里讲授；曲齿锥齿轮的轴承载荷分析则归并到汽车专业课程里讲授……。这样就可以解决不少的困难问题。杰门节夫同志又给分析了教材内容、课程设计题目，我们觉得设计题目还算容易，便建议将设计时数由五十四减为四十八，讲课时数由七十六增到八十二（学程的总时数还是一样）。我们又考虑到本学期学习时间较正常的学习时间为短，在分析了各专业的情况以后，决定暂把“曲轴”一章删掉，留给专业课程讲授（但这仅是本年度暂时的措施）。
    完成了教学大纲的修改工作以后，我又把新旧教学大纲对比着阅读了一遍，虽然看上去有些节目还是相同的，但分量却不相同了。每项内容对我都很熟悉，好像我对教材和讲授方法都已有了把握似的。杰门节夫同志说：“……如果在教学中发现进度有赶前或落后的现象，不合于教学日历，就可以不慌不忙地权衡内容之轻重，作适当的调节。”这话是对的。
    通过这次修改教学大纲的工作，我认识到要作好修改教学大纲的工作，首先须要明确认识教学的目的性，并必须注意政治思想教育，然后再结合具体情况，和各方面密切配合，将教材加以适当的调整。特别要注意的是，要把原则体现到大纲里去，如果空谈原则而不联系实际是作不好工作的。
