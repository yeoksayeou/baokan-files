    On a day after the rain, I visited a market in northern Korea.

    Vehicles streamed along the road, and people heading to the market converged from all directions into a valley: the elderly wore clean cotton robes, and the young women wore short jackets and long skirts, their faces revealing calmness and joy. The American invaders destroyed many towns in northern Korea, but the stubborn Korean people have established new markets in remote villages and valleys. The market I visited was surrounded by dense forests, with apricot and peach blossoms blooming everywhere, and a warm breeze occasionally carrying a fragrance. On the hills near the market, the anti-aircraft artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteers vigilantly guarded the sky. The local Korean government also established an agency here to manage the market and lead the trade.

    People who came to do business from all directions set up stalls piled high with goods, some even erected cloth sheds. The market had all kinds of goods: rubber shoes and cotton cloth made by Korean factories, rice and apples produced locally, large quantities of salt, fish, seaweed supplied by fishermen and salt workers, and Wonsan soju, a local specialty transported from the east coast; as well as Soviet calico, daily necessities produced in China, and Czech leather shoes. The mobile sales department of the state-owned consumer cooperative hung a huge white banner with blue characters between two willow trees, commemorating the "May Day" International Labor Day and offering preferential treatment to people from all walks of life; all goods were greatly reduced in price! People buying goods squeezed through the market. Young women were selecting clothing materials at the silk and satin stalls, elderly people were dyeing sky-blue clothes in the dyeing shop, and innocent and lively elementary school students were buying stationery and newly published books in the mobile sales department. Procurement personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were also purchasing vegetables at the market.

    In a cloth shed in another corner of the market, the mobile canteen of the state-owned consumer cooperative was open for business, and the guests filled all the seats. Several stalls also displayed exquisite water buckets and washbasins made from auxiliary fuel tanks dropped by American planes, and hoes and picks made from shrapnel. Farmers were crowded around, vying to buy them. The mad destruction of the American invaders and the Korean people's love of labor and spirit of overcoming difficulties to create a better life formed a strong contrast here.

    In these difficult war years, the Korean government has taken various effective measures to improve the material life of the working people and raise the level of industrial and agricultural production. According to Jin Wangxian, the person in charge of a state-owned county consumer cooperative, about 20,000 people come to this market each time, but it can only be considered a medium-sized market. The total business income of each market day in the spring of this year increased threefold compared with the highest month in the same season last year. The state-owned county consumer cooperative completed 135 percent of its original plan in just twenty-five days in April of this year. The county consumer cooperative also specially organized fifty-seven mobile sales departments to operate in villages throughout the county based on the needs of the farmers.

    The Korean government's wartime economic policies have alleviated the people's difficulties in the war and have won the people's heartfelt support and gratitude. I visited the mother of Kim Hwang-dun, a soldier of the People's Army who came to the market from more than fifty miles away. There are now five people in her family, and she and her daughter-in-law produce together. During this year's spring plowing, they planted 3,700 pyeong of rice, all of which was cultivated by the state-owned farm with tractors. She happily told me: "We had a bumper harvest last autumn. In addition to paying the public grain and leaving enough grain for this year, we also had a surplus. Today we came to sell some of the surplus grain and buy some cloth to make clothes for our daughter-in-law and grandson. Our lives can be improved in the war. This is thanks to the Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung."

    In the evening, the people who came to the market purchased various goods and returned from the market in twos and threes, talking and laughing. The Korean people have become stronger and stronger in the tempering of the flames of war.

### 一个朝鲜的战时集市

    一个朝鲜的战时集市
    新华社记者　殷步实
    在一个雨后初晴的日子，我访问了朝鲜北部某地的一个集市。
    公路上车辆络绎不绝，赶集的人从四面八方向一个山谷里汇集：老年人穿着干净的棉布长袍，年青的姑娘们穿着短袄和长裙，他们的脸上流露着镇定和愉快的神情。美国侵略者把朝鲜北部许多城镇破坏了，倔强的朝鲜人民就在偏僻的乡村和山谷里建立起新的集市。我所访问的这个集市，周围都是密密的树林，杏花和桃花到处开放着，暖风不时吹来一阵清香。在集市附近的山岭上，中国人民志愿军的高射炮部队警惕地守卫着天空。当地的朝鲜政府也在这里设立了管理集市的机构，领导着贸易的进行。
    从四面八方赶来做生意的人，在集市上摆着一个个堆满物品的地摊，有的还撑起布棚。集市上有着各种各样的货物：朝鲜工厂制造的胶鞋、棉布，当地出产的大米、苹果，渔民和盐民供应的大量盐、鱼、海菜和自东海岸运来的元山烧酒等大宗土产；还有苏联花布，中国出产的日用品和捷克的皮鞋。国营消费组合（合作社）移动贩卖部在两棵柳树之间挂了一条巨大的写着蓝字的白布标语，纪念“五一”国际劳动节，优待各界人民；货物一律大减价！购买货物的人，在市场上挤来挤去。年青的妇女们在绸缎摊上选购衣料，老年人在染色店里染天蓝色的衣服，天真活泼的小学生们在移动贩卖部里购买文具和新出版的书籍。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的采买员也在集上采购菜蔬。
    在集市另一个角落的布棚里，国营消费组合的移动食堂在那里营业，客人们坐满了所有的席位。还有几家铺摊上放着用美国飞机扔下的副油箱做成的精致的水桶和脸盆，用炸弹片打成的锄头和铁镐。农民们正围集在那里争着购买。美国侵略者的疯狂破坏和朝鲜人民热爱劳动、战胜困难为创造美好生活而斗争的精神，在这里形成了强烈的对比。
    在这艰难的战争岁月里，朝鲜政府采取了各种有效措施来改善劳动人民的物质生活，提高工、农业的生产水平。据国营某郡消费组合的负责人金旺贤说，这个集市每次约有二万人来赶集，但还只能算是一个中等的集市。今年春季每次逢集市场的营业总收入，比去年同季最高月份的收入提高了三倍。国营某郡消费组合今年四月份仅以二十五天时间就完成了原订计划的百分之一百三十五。某郡消费组合还根据农民的要求，专门组织了五十七个移动贩卖部，到全郡各乡村去营业。
    朝鲜政府的战时经济政策减轻了人民在战争中的困难，获得了人民衷心的拥护和感激。我访问了一个从五十多里外来赶集的人民军战士金煌敦的母亲。她家里现在有五口人，由她和儿媳两人生产。今年春耕时，她们种了三千七百坪稻子，全部由国营农场用拖拉机帮助耕种。她愉快地告诉我：“去年秋天庄稼丰收，我们除了缴纳公粮和留下今年吃的粮食外，并且还剩余了一部分。今天赶来卖掉一些余粮，买点布给媳妇和小孙儿做衣服。我们的生活能够在战争里得到改善，这是劳动党和金日成元帅的功劳。”
    傍晚，来赶集的人们采办了各种货物，三三两两地谈笑着从集上回去。朝鲜人民在战争烽火的锻炼中，已经越来越坚强了。
