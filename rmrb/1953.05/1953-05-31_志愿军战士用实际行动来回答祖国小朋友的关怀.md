    Volunteer Soldiers Use Practical Actions to Respond to the Care of Children of the Motherland
    A letter from Wang Shu, a soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to the children of the motherland: Do you know that the Volunteer Army uncles fighting in Korea, far away from the motherland, are also welcoming "June 1st" with the most joyful mood and active actions, just like you! Your hearts are closely linked with the uncles' hearts!
    Here are two things to tell you!
    Wang Yingjie, a Young Pioneer from Qiqihar, Northeast China, wrote a letter to the third squad of a tank company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, saying: "Dear uncles, in order to protect our happy life, you brave the ice and snow, and fight heroically against the enemy of the world's peace-American imperialism. Uncles, you are so lovely and glorious! I want to report to you what a happy life we are living now. My father is an old worker and is now the director of the factory; my mother used to be a housewife, but she also joined the work some time ago; my sister is in the nursery; I am already in the sixth grade of elementary school and will soon go to middle school. My father often strokes my head and tells me: Workers are factory directors, and workers' sons go to school to study. This is all the happiness brought by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! He wants me to study hard and serve the motherland when I grow up! I often think to myself, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party bring us happiness, and the Volunteer Army uncles are firmly defending our happiness. If I don't study hard, how can I be worthy of the uncles?..."
    When the comrades of the third squad received this letter, they were accepting the task of blocking the 190.7 height. Braving the enemy's fierce artillery fire, they drove the tanks to the front of the position, waiting under the bunker for the frantically invading enemy. At this moment, driver Jiang Daoxing read Wang Yingjie's letter to all the comrades in the car. The gunner and electrician listened quietly, and although the squad leader's eyes were monitoring the front, he was afraid of missing a word.
    Wang Yingjie's letter inspired all the comrades in the third squad. Everyone unanimously made up their minds to resolutely hold the position, eliminate the enemy, and defend the motherland and the happy life of the people of the motherland. ... The enemy's artillery continued to fire, the soil on the mountain was scorched, and the bunker was hit dozens of times. The soldiers of the third squad bravely rushed to put out the fire and save the vehicles despite the enemy's artillery fire. Driver Wang Daoxing's arm was injured, and the squad leader's head was injured, but none of them left the firing line. They blocked for twelve days and nights, annihilating an enemy infantry battalion and two tanks.
    In addition, we have a communication soldier in our unit named Zhang Shuyun, who returned to the motherland for recuperation due to illness before the Spring Festival this year. He met many children while walking in Beining Park in Tianjin. During their team days, they often asked Comrade Zhang Shuyun to tell them battle stories, and often asked if Uncle Zhang had performed meritorious service and whether he was a hero. After Zhang Shuyun recovered from his illness and returned to the team, the children often wrote letters to greet him. A few days ago, he received more than a dozen letters from children, reporting on their lives in the motherland and asking if Uncle Zhang had performed meritorious service. The friendship of the children inspired Comrade Zhang Shuyun to work harder. Once, he became ill from digging tunnels, but he still insisted on working. No matter how others persuaded him, he refused to rest. He said, "If I don't work, can I be worthy of the children's hopes?" Now he is working actively, preparing to perform meritorious service and become a hero.
    Children, there are thousands upon thousands of similar things. Your care for us encourages us to use practical actions to answer you.... The sound of artillery rang again, let me pick up my weapons and go to the position to fight the enemy hard as a "June 1st" gift for you!

    志愿军战士用实际行动来回答祖国小朋友的关怀
    志愿军某部战士王树写给祖国小朋友们的信：你们知道吗，远离祖国战斗在朝鲜的志愿军叔叔们也和你们一样用最愉快的心情和积极的行动来迎接“六一”！你们的心和叔叔们的心是紧紧连在一起的！
    这里告诉你们两件事！
    东北齐齐哈尔少年儿童队员王英洁给志愿军某部坦克连三班写了一封信说：“亲爱的叔叔们为了保卫我们的幸福生活，卧冰踏雪，和世界和平人民的敌人——美帝国主义英勇战斗。叔叔，你们真可爱、真光荣！我要向叔叔们报告我们现在过的是怎样的幸福生活。我爸爸是个老工人，现在当了厂长；妈妈过去是个家庭妇女，前些日子也参加了工作；妹妹上了托儿所；我已经念小学六年级了，很快就要上中学。我爸爸常常摸着我的头告诉我：工人当厂长，工人的儿子上学念书。这都是毛主席、共产党带来的幸福！要我好好学习，长大了好为祖国服务！我自己也时常想，毛主席、共产党给咱带来幸福，志愿军叔叔又坚强地保卫着咱们的幸福，我要不好好念书能对得起叔叔们吗？……”
    三班同志们接到这封信的时候，正接受阻击一九○·七高地的任务。他们冒着敌人猛烈的炮火将坦克开到阵地前沿，在掩体底下等待着疯狂进犯的敌人。就在这时，驾驶员姜道兴同志向全车同志朗读了王英洁小朋友的信。炮长、机电员低头静听着，车长的双目虽然监视着前方但他深怕漏掉一个字。
    王英洁小朋友的信鼓舞了三班全体同志。大家不约而同地下决心要坚决守住阵地，消灭敌人，要保卫祖国和祖国人民的幸福生活。……敌人排炮不断地发射，山上的土炸焦了，掩体被打着十几次，三班的战士们英勇地冒着敌人炮火扑火救车。驾驶员王道兴同志胳臂打坏了，车长头部挂彩了，但是他们谁也没下火线。他们一直阻击了十二昼夜，消灭了敌人一个步兵营和两辆坦克。
    另外，我们部队里有个叫张树筠的通讯员，今年春节前因病回祖国休养。他在天津北宁公园散步，结识了很多小朋友。他们在队日的时候常约张树筠同志给他们讲战斗故事，并常常问张叔叔立过功没有，是不是英雄。张树筠同志病好返队后，小朋友们常常写信来问候他。前些日子他又接到十几封小朋友的来信，报告他们在祖国的生活，还问张叔叔立功没有？小朋友们的友情激励着张树筠同志更顽强地工作。有一次他挖坑道累病了，还是坚持干，别人怎么劝他，他也不肯休息，他说：“我不干我能对得起小朋友们的希望吗？”现在他正积极工作，准备立功当英雄呢。
    小朋友们，类似这样的事情有千千万万件。你们对我们的关怀，鼓励着我们用实际行动来回答你们……。炮声又响了，让我拿起武器走上阵地，狠狠打敌人，作为给你们的“六一”礼物吧！
