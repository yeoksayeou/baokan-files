Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st: The Second All-Union Conference on the History of Natural Sciences recently held in Moscow heard a report by Soviet Master of Physics and Mathematics, K. Rybnikov, on the study of Karl Marx's mathematical manuscripts.

It is known that Karl Marx began studying mathematics in order to write "Das Kapital." In addition to mathematics that was practically useful for his economic research, he also delved into various mathematical problems. This research continued for twenty-seven years, until his death. This great master of science left behind some manuscripts on demonstrating differential calculus from a dialectical materialist viewpoint. For a long time, no one had studied Marx's more than one thousand pages of mathematical manuscripts. Soviet mathematician S. Yanovskaya first studied and published a portion of Marx's mathematical manuscripts, preserved at the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in Moscow, in the mid-1930s. Recently, K. Rybnikov has continued this work, and a special article will be published soon.

    苏联科学家举行会议研究马克思数学手稿
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：第二次全苏自然科学史会议最近在莫斯科举行，听取了苏联物理数学硕士康·雷布尼科夫关于研究卡尔·马克思数学手稿的报告。
    大家知道，卡尔·马克思为了写“资本论”，曾开始研究数学。除了对他的经济研究工作有实用意义的数学外，他还深入地研究了各种数学问题。他这种研究工作继续了二十七年，一直到逝世为止。这位伟大的科学大师留下了一些关于以辩证唯物观点论证微分法的手稿。长时期以来没有人研究过马克思的一千多页的数学手稿。苏联数学家索·雅诺夫斯卡娅曾在二十世纪三十年代中第一次研究和发表了保藏在莫斯科马克思—恩格斯—列宁学院中的马克思数学手稿的一部分。最近，康·雷布尼科夫继续了这项工作，不久将有专文发表。
