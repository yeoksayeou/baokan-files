    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: Recent signs indicate that while people around the world and the American people are eager to achieve an immediate armistice in Korea, a small group of warmongers within the U.S. ruling clique are insisting on continuing the Korean War. This is the background to the so-called "counter-proposal" put forward by the U.S. side on May 13th, which "threatened the entire future of the armistice negotiations."

    Since the Korean-Chinese side successively proposed the six-point proposal and the eight-point proposal on April 26th and May 7th, world opinion generally believes that these proposals have paved the way for a Korean armistice and brought the greatest hope for peace. However, the actions of a group of people within the U.S. ruling clique have confirmed that they are now unwilling to stop the war.

    On the same day that our six-point proposal was put forward, the Agence France-Presse correspondent in Washington reported that supporters of MacArthur had begun to clamor again in Congress and elsewhere. They said that the Asian problem could not be resolved peacefully, and they once again demanded a large-scale offensive "to win the final military victory in Korea." On May 3rd, Dewey Short, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, exposed the ambition of a small group of Americans to resolutely continue the war to conquer all of Korea in a television broadcast. He said: "Even if it is necessary to continue the current war and push it to the Yalu River to resolve the Korean War, the United States should still insist on unifying all of Korea." International News Service reported from Seoul on the 7th that senior U.S. military officials in Korea insisted on continuing the Korean War. The cable said, "In the opinion of most responsible officials, as long as Washington provides a little more manpower and material support, a military victory can be achieved."

    When the news of our eight-point new proposal just reached Washington, those warmongers who feared peace as if they feared the plague hurriedly fabricated rumors and distorted our major effort to immediately realize a Korean armistice. Republican Senator Knowland falsely claimed that the Korean-Chinese proposal "is a trick." Reflecting the opinions of these people, the American "World Telegram" could not hide its fear of peace and said:

    "If Eisenhower falls into this trap set by the Communists, then he is too stupid."

    The hysterical cries of this small group of people within the U.S. ruling clique and the delaying tactics played by the U.S. side at the negotiating table have aroused the anger of the people of the world and the dissatisfaction of the U.S. allies who are trapped in the quagmire of the Korean War. "The New York Times" admitted: "The current development is completely unexpected by Washington. One difficulty the United States is currently facing is that the United Nations has expressed a warm welcome to this proposal (referring to our eight-point proposal)." In the British Parliament, the diplomatic debate launched a fierce condemnation and attack on the U.S. delaying negotiations, and many members accused some powerful people in the United States of being unwilling to stop the war. Former British Prime Minister Attlee once publicly said that "some people in the United States do not want to resolve this armistice issue,"... Under this situation, which has become the target of public criticism, the U.S. side had to come out to quibble in order to cope with this very unfavorable situation. They attempted to deny the attitude of delaying negotiations that was obviously impossible to deny, and pretended to desire peace. President Eisenhower did not hesitate to come forward himself to cover up for the warmongers who were under heavy attack from all sides. At a press conference in Washington on the 14th, when answering former British Prime Minister Attlee's doubts about the sincerity of some Americans for peace, he said: "I have not met a person in the United States who does not want peace." However, things turned out to be different from what Eisenhower said. On the same day that Eisenhower made his statement, in the same American capital, Washington, there appeared American "powerful people" who did not want peace. Republican Senator McCarthy attacked Britain's attitude towards the Korean War in a speech in the Senate, shouting loudly with a disgusting rogue tone: "Let them get out, damn it!" "If anyone tries to coerce us into accepting the Communist peace on the grounds that Britain is going to withdraw, then we can 'go it alone'." He also boasted: "The United States is strong enough, it has the courage and the strength to win its war." Another Republican Senator Knowland apparently not only opposed the realization of an armistice in Korea, but also openly advocated the adventure of expanding the war. He openly demanded that the United States study its position in Asia, Europe and the Americas "to see who will support us once a war breaks out." Former commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, Van Fleet, published an article on "The Truth About Korea" in "Life Magazine" on the 13th, hysterically advocating the continuation and expansion of the war of aggression against Korea. Although he admitted that taking such a policy "would be extremely dangerous," he firmly advocated that "the only practical solution" in Korea was "to achieve a military victory." He said: There is "no possible basis for reaching a real political solution in the Far East" with the Chinese People's Government. He clamored: "We must eliminate that regime. We must defeat their army in Korea and help Chiang Kai-shek and his soldiers return to the mainland." At the same time, it is worth noting that the U.S. government recently recommended Admiral Radford, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, to the Senate to succeed Bradley, who will step down in August, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As everyone knows, Radford is one of the main advocates of "blockading" China. All this proves precisely what British Member of Parliament Paul Hynd accused: "There are many Americans, even many people in the American government, who are unwilling to end the Korean War at this time."

### 美国统治集团内一小撮好战分子  害怕和平实现坚持继续朝鲜战争

    美国统治集团内一小撮好战分子
    害怕和平实现坚持继续朝鲜战争
    【新华社开城十六日电】本社特派记者报道：最近种种迹象显示：当全世界人民和美国人民都渴望立即实现朝鲜停战的时候，美国统治集团内一小撮好战分子却坚持继续朝鲜战争。这就是美方五月十三日提出的“威胁了整个停战谈判前途”的所谓“反建议”的背景。
    从朝中方面在四月二十六日和五月七日先后提出了六点方案和八点方案以后，世界舆论普遍认为这些建议为朝鲜停战铺平了道路，给和平带来了最大的希望。但是，美国统治集团内有一部分人的行动，却证实了他们现在决不愿意停战。
    在我方六点建议提出后的当天，法新社驻华盛顿的记者就报道说，赞成麦克阿瑟的人又开始在国会和其他地方喧嚷起来了。他们说亚洲问题不可能获得和平解决，他们再度要求发动大规模攻势，“以在朝鲜赢得最后的军事胜利”。五月三日，美众议院军事委员会主席杜伊·萧特在电视广播中暴露了美国一小撮人坚决要继续战争以征服全朝鲜的野心。他说：“即使有必要把目前的战事继续进行下去，并且推到鸭绿江边以解决朝鲜战争，美国还是应该坚持统一全朝鲜。”国际新闻社汉城七日电透露了在朝鲜的美军高级官员坚持继续朝鲜战争的立场。该电说，“在大多数的负责官员看来，只要华盛顿方面再给予一点人力和物资的支持，就能够获得军事胜利。”
    当我方提出八点新建议的消息刚刚传到华盛顿时，那些害怕和平犹如害怕疫疠的好战分子慌忙大造谣言，歪曲我方这一能立即实现朝鲜停战的重大努力。共和党参议员诺兰信口雌黄说：朝中方面的建议“是一种诡计”。反映了这类人的意见的美国“世界电讯报”掩盖不住他对和平的恐惧情绪说：
    “如果艾森豪威尔走入共产党布置的这种陷井中，那他真是太愚蠢了。”
    美国统治集团内这一小撮人的歇斯底里的叫嚷，和美方在谈判桌上所玩弄的拖延伎俩，引起了世界人民的愤怒，也引起了陷于朝鲜战争泥坑而不能自拔的美国盟国的不满。“纽约时报”承认：“目前的发展完全出乎华盛顿意料之外，美国目前所面临的一个困难就是联合国对这个建议（指我方的八点建议）表示热烈的欢迎。”英国议会在外交辩论中向美国拖延谈判展开了猛烈的责难和攻击，不少议员指责美国一部分有势力的人不愿意停战。英国前任首相艾德礼就曾公开说“美国有些人不要解决这停战问题”，……在这种已经成为众矢之的情况下，美国方面不能不出来进行诡辩，以应付这种十分不利的处境。他们企图抵赖显然已经无法抵赖的拖延谈判的态度，装作愿望和平的姿态。艾森豪威尔总统不惜亲自出马，为大受各方攻击的好战分子掩饰。他在十四日的华盛顿记者招待会上答复前任英国首相艾德礼对某些美国人的和平诚意表示怀疑时说：“我在美国没有遇见一个不要和平的人。”但是，事情竟又与艾森豪威尔说的不一样。就在艾森豪威尔发表谈话的同一天，在同一个美国的首都华盛顿，却出现了不要和平的美国“有势力的人”。共和党参议员麦卡锡在参院发言中攻击英国对朝鲜战争的态度时，带着令人厌恶的流氓口吻大声叫嚷说：“让他们退出好了，该死的！”“假如有人企图以不然英国要退出为理由来要挟我们接受共产党的和平的话，那我们是能够‘单独干下去的’。”他又吹嘘说：“美国足够强大，它有勇气，有力量赢得它的战争。”另一个共和党参议员诺兰显然不仅反对在朝鲜实现停战，而且露骨地主张进行扩大战争的冒险。他公开要求美国研究一下它在亚洲、欧洲和美洲的地位，“来看一看一旦打起来的时候，谁会支持我们”。前美国第八军军长范佛里特十三日在“生活杂志”上发表了一篇关于“朝鲜真相”的文章，歇斯底里地主张继续和扩大侵朝战争。他虽然承认采取这种政策“会有极大的危险”，但是却坚决主张在朝鲜“唯一切实的解决办法是取得军事胜利”。他说：和中国人民政府“在远东达成真正的政治解决，并没有可能的基础”。他叫嚣说：“我们必须消灭那个政权。我们必须击败他们在朝鲜的军队，并帮助蒋介石以及他的兵士们回到大陆。”同时值得注意的是，美国政府最近已向参议院推荐美太平洋舰队总司令雷德福继将于八月卸任的布莱德雷为美国参谋长联席会议主席。众所周知，雷德福是对中国实行“封锁”的主要鼓吹人之一。所有这一切都恰恰证明了英国国会议员保罗·辛德所指责的：“有许多美国人、甚至有许多美国政府的人士不愿意在这个时候结束朝鲜战争。”
