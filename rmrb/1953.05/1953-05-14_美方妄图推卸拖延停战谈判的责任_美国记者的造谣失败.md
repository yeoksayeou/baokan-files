Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 13th: Our correspondent reports: Because Harrison's use of trivial issues to delay negotiations has aroused censure from world opinion, the United States is trying to create the myth of so-called "Communist delay of negotiations." However, in the face of ironclad facts, even those American reporters who are accustomed to fabricating lies under orders feel powerless. The failure of American International News Service reporter Han Doman is a good example.

On the 12th, Han Doman sent a report from Panmunjom, attempting to portray Harrison's persistent delays as the "stagnation" of the Korean-Chinese side. In this news piece, Han Doman informed a person named Handley that he wrote this news because "New York wanted more specific information about the Communist delay of negotiations." In order to complete this specific mission, he fabricated two pieces of news, believing that adding information based on Harrison's statements at the negotiation meetings "would satisfy New York's requirements."

One of the two pieces of so-called "more specific information" fabricated by Han Doman describes the situation inside the conference room. Although everyone knows that Han Doman is not qualified to attend the meeting, Han Doman still reported the situation in the conference room with great seriousness, saying that the Korean-Chinese side "expressed disgust at the arguments of the United Nations side," attempting to give the impression that the Korean-Chinese side had no sincerity in the negotiations. The second piece of news fabricated by Han Doman was about the outside of the conference room, saying that "Communist propagandists" talked about world opinion welcoming the recent proposals of the Korean-Chinese side, and talked about Dulles' recent statement. Then Han Doman made an unfounded and inexplicable conclusion, saying that "in the past," whenever world opinion favored the proposals of the Korean-Chinese side, "the Communist representatives would slow down the negotiations." He clearly attempted to use such clumsy propaganda to shift the responsibility for delaying the negotiations to the Korean-Chinese side.

Anyone can see that, for very obvious reasons, Han Doman dared not even mention the Korean-Chinese side's response to the trivial issues raised by Harrison. In desperation, Han Doman, as a tool of the American warmongers, could only resort to fabrication and arbitrary nonsense. But this ridiculous lie cannot cover up the eyes of the world watching Panmunjom. The world now clearly knows who is obstructing the negotiations. As British Labor MP Strachey said on the 11th: "If the armistice negotiations break down again in the current circumstances, world opinion will not place the responsibility for causing the breakdown on the Chinese or Korean side."

    美方妄图推卸拖延停战谈判的责任
    美国记者的造谣失败
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者报道：由于哈利逊用枝节问题拖延谈判已经引起了世界舆论的责难，美国方面正在企图制造所谓“共方拖延谈判”的神话。但是，在铁的事实面前，甚至那些惯于奉命造谣的美国记者们也感到无能为力了。美国国际新闻社记者韩多曼的失败，就是一个很好的例子。
    韩多曼在十二日从板门店发出了一篇报道，企图把哈利逊的一味拖延，说成是朝中方面的“停顿不前”。在这篇新闻中间，韩多曼通知一个名叫汉德莱的人说，他写这篇新闻是因为“纽约方面向我要关于共方拖延谈判的更具体的消息”。为了完成这个特定的差使，他捏造了两段消息，他认为再加上以哈利逊在谈判会议上的发言为根据的消息，“当可以满足纽约方面的要求”了。
    韩多曼制造的两段所谓“更具体的消息”，一段是描写会议室里面的情形的。虽然谁都知道，韩多曼是没有资格参加会议的，但是韩多曼还是煞有介事地报道了会议室中的情形，说朝中方面“对联军方面的论据表示讨厌”，企图给人一种印象，好像朝中方面对谈判并无诚意。韩多曼制造的第二段消息是关于会议室外面的，说“共方宣传分子”谈论世界舆论欢迎朝中方面的最近建议，谈论杜勒斯最近的声明。于是韩多曼作了一个毫无根据的莫名其妙的结论，说“过去”每当世界舆论赞成朝中方面建议的时候，“共方代表就把谈判放慢”。他显然企图用这样拙劣的宣传，把谈判拖延的责任推给朝中方面。
    谁都可以看得出来，由于很明显的理由，韩多曼对于朝中方面就哈利逊提出的枝节问题所作的答复连提也不敢提。在无可如何之中，作为美国好战分子的工具的韩多曼，只能乞灵于凭空捏造和任意胡扯。但是这种可笑的谎言是掩盖不住全世界向板门店注视着的眼睛的。全世界现在清楚地知道是谁在阻挠谈判。正如英国工党议员斯特拉彻在十一日所说的：“如果在目前情况下停战谈判再度破裂，世界舆论将不会把引起破裂的责任加诸中国或朝鲜方面。”
