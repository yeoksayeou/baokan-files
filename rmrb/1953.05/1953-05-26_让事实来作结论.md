Let the Facts Draw the Conclusion
Li Yuxiu Yang Huirong

    The state-owned Taiyuan Machine Factory overfulfilled the state plan for the first quarter of 1953, with the total value of production exceeding the original plan by 4.89 percent and the total value of goods exceeding the original plan by 7.84 percent. But what methods did the Taiyuan Machine Factory adopt to complete the plan?

    Serious Imbalances

    Judging from the completion of the first quarter's plan this year, the imbalance in the production of the Taiyuan Machine Factory is extremely serious. If the total value of production completed in the first quarter is taken as 100, January accounted for 17.42 percent, February accounted for 22.05 percent, and March accounted for 60.53 percent. If the actual working hours in the first quarter are taken as 100, January accounted for 29.8 percent, February accounted for slightly more than 26 percent, and March accounted for slightly more than 44 percent. Taking the metalworking workshop as an example, if the total value of production completed in the first quarter is taken as 100, January accounted for 11.91 percent, February accounted for 21.8 percent, and March accounted for 66.28 percent. Looking at the completion of the monthly plan, with the total output value of March as 100, the first half of the month accounted for 31.45 percent, while the second half of the month accounted for 68.5 percent. Looking at the completion of the plan in the metalworking workshop in March, if the total output value in March is taken as 100, the workshop completed 19 percent in the first ten days, 24 percent in the middle ten days, and 57 percent in the last ten days. The metalworking workshop was short more than 10,000 working hours in March, and the welding and iron riveting workshops oversupplied more than 10,000 working hours to the metalworking workshop. The severity of the imbalance between departments can be seen. On March 24, the assembly workshop had not yet seen the parts for the first ten drilling rigs and the "traction" for seven coal cutters, which meant that this place had been idle for a long time waiting for materials.

    The statistics cited above tell us that the completion of the Taiyuan Machine Factory's first quarter plan was mainly in March, and March was almost entirely in the last ten days. This fact illustrates two issues: (1) The enterprise still has great potential capacity; (2) The imbalance in production has caused serious losses to the country.

    Can the production plan be completed without adopting rush tactics? Among the main leading cadres and the broad masses of workers of the Taiyuan Machine Factory, there are two different views: one group believes that to complete the task, production must be rushed; the other group believes that as long as the organization work is done well, the plan can be completed without rushing. Facts can answer loudly who is right and who is wrong.

    The Bad Consequences of Rushing Production

    The Taiyuan Machine Factory is the key factory for the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China to promote the experience of Factory 53. In the process of experimenting with the experience of Factory 53, some experience has been gained in the Party's political and ideological work. For example, in completing the plan, a Party propaganda team was organized, and slogans such as "racing against time with wisdom" and some powerful measures were put forward, which encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the workers and played a considerable role in ensuring the completion of the plan. However, the Taiyuan Machine Factory adopted three rush tactics in completing the first quarter's plan, and the consequences were very bad. First, cadres from functional departments went to the workshops, those who could operate machine tools did the work themselves, and those who could not operate machine tools "did odd jobs". On March 25, cadres from all functional departments of the factory were involved in the rush campaign. Messengers poured water and added oil in the workshop. The workers asked the messengers pouring water: "Will you pour water now, and will you pour water later?" The messengers said: "Pour water during the rush task, but not later!" The general affairs section also drew people to the assembly workshop to tighten screws and brush oil. This method made the workers overly nervous during the rush period and increased the chaos in the workshop. Many group leaders in the metalworking workshop said: "On March 31, I didn't know what our group's workers were doing or how many pieces they had made." The assembly workshop could not accommodate so many people, so they moved the benches to the yard to work.

    Second, working overtime and staying up late harmed the workers' health. In March, some workers could not rest properly on Sundays, some workers took turns resting on Sundays, and in the last few days, many workers went to work at 5 o'clock and were still working at 8 or 9 o'clock. Especially in the last three days, overtime and staying up late were even more serious. According to statistics from the assembly workshop alone: of the 85 people in the entire workshop, 35 worked overtime until 7 or 8 pm on the 29th, 47 worked overtime until 9 pm on the 30th, and 77 worked overtime until after 12 o'clock on the 31st, with some people staying up all night. Some people described the scene at the time as: "At 12 o'clock on the night of the 31st, the assembly workshop was more lively than a fair." The bad consequences of working overtime and staying up late are also obvious. Wu Yugui, a worker in the Ma Lu group in the metalworking workshop, vomited blood while working overtime. The attendance rate in the assembly workshop in early April decreased by 1.8 percentage points compared to March.

    Third, relaxing product inspection standards. According to the inspection department's statistics: in March, the number of defective products from riveters increased by 0.45 percentage points compared to the previous month, metalworkers increased by 0.34 percentage points, and tools increased by 1.27 percentage points. Taking the quality of the factory's main product, drilling rigs, as an example, defective products from the iron casting workshop increased by 1.98 percentage points compared to the previous month, steel casting increased by 8.99 percentage points, riveting increased by 0.5 percentage points, metalworking increased by 1.07 percentage points, and tools increased by 3.65 percentage points. This is still for products that have been inspected. As for the quality of products that have not been inspected and are directly taken for assembly, even the inspectors are unclear. The consequence of this method is that a large number of defective products are put into storage.

    Loose Before and Tight After in Executing the Plan

    Even now, some leading cadres of the Taiyuan Machine Factory believe that rushing production in March was a "good start". Let the situation of completing the plan in early April speak for itself. According to the factory's planning department's statistics: in early April, the factory completed 56.3 percent of the planned total value of goods and 66.59 percent of the total value of production. It's okay if the plan for the first ten days of the month is not completed, it's piled up to the middle and last ten days again. Meng Lan, director of the assembly workshop, said anxiously: "According to the contact contract, the metalworking workshop should provide us with complete sets of parts for five drilling rigs before April 10, but they have not been delivered by the 15th. Isn't it obvious that production in the second half of the month will be tight?" Jia Xingwang, secretary of the assembly workshop's Party branch, said it well: "The situation in March and April is the same. If you say April is better than March, it's just that the emergency meeting was held on the 24th in March, and such a meeting was held on the 14th in April." This proves that it is not a "good start".

    Facts Prove That the Plan Can Be Completed Without Rushing

    Can the Taiyuan Machine Factory complete the state plan for the first quarter without adopting rush tactics? The answer from the facts is that it can not only be completed, but also overfulfilled the plan evenly. Of course, it is more difficult to implement balanced production in machine manufacturing plants, such as imbalances in equipment, complex product parts, and precise quality requirements. However, these difficulties can be overcome. Especially the Taiyuan Machine Factory, which has gained some experience in implementing plan management last year, such as component assignment, joint groups, and compiling work plans. If these experiences are continued to be improved, the balance of production can be improved, and there is no need to adopt rush tactics to complete the first quarter's plan.

    There were conditions for organizing balanced production in the first quarter of this year. On December 10 last year, the factory compiled the plan for the first quarter of this year for the first time. It was revised again at the end of January this year. According to the final decision, the number of coal cutters was reduced by two compared to the first plan, and other products were not changed. The total output value was reduced by 100 million yuan compared to the first time. In mid-February, the factory adjusted the plan itself, reducing some coal cutters and increasing some drilling rigs, but the total output value did not change. Compared with the first quarter of last year, the production task for the first quarter of this year has reduced the total output value by 500 million yuan. From the perspective of labor utilization rate, the average for the factory in the first quarter was only 66 percent, and the metalworking workshop reached 85.3 percent. It seems that the plan for the first quarter of this year is not advanced. It would have been great to have completed the 1952 production task two months ahead of schedule and used this time to carry out various preparations for 1953. If the leading cadres were clear-headed and conscientiously treated the state plan, they could have completed the first quarter's plan evenly and exceeded it, and the excess indicators would have been much larger than those rushed out. However, the leading cadres were blindly complacent, thinking that it was not bad. Therefore, a good condition that should have been used was wasted. Take the matter of changing the leadscrew from "Imperial" to "Metric" as an example. It was decided to change the system in October last year, and a plan was set. It was entrusted to a brother factory for processing. The processing was not smooth, and it was scrapped halfway. The leading cadres did not think of active methods, which affected the completion of the plan. In terms of technical preparation, the original assignment for manufacturing 65-horsepower coal cutters and large internal gear templates was given to Song Yuan for drafting, but Song Yuan was on sick leave. At first, the leading cadres did not know, and later they did not care after they knew, which resulted in an extension of one month. The production organization was extremely unreasonable. After the plan changed in January, the metalworking workshop was short of people, while the welding workshop had a surplus of labor. The leadership did not adjust it in time. In January, manufacturing tools was very important. However, only one shift of the eleven machine tools in the tool workshop was operating. On the one hand, the capacity of the machinery and equipment was not发挥, and on the other hand, work was stopped due to the lack of tools. The work arrangements of various departments were separated from production. Some were selecting models, some were eliminating illiteracy, and some were compiling plans. The Party committee did not unify the thinking of the cadres, so that the above work revolved around production. Everyone was busy, but no one was in charge of production. In February, the Spring Festival holiday was encountered, and production was even more unattended. Until early March, production was still in a state of flux, and some workshops were idle waiting for materials (such as assembly). When the leadership found that the problem was serious on March 24, only seven days were left in the first quarter.

    The leading cadres' blind complacency, their bureaucratic style of being satisfied with general leadership and being busy with affairs all day long, and their reliance on the idea of "rushing" to complete the plan are the main obstacles to implementing plan management and carrying out balanced production. The facts have already given such an answer. (Originally published in Shanxi Daily)

    让事实来作结论
    李玉秀  杨惠荣
    国营太原机器厂超额完成了一九五三年第一季度国家计划，生产总值超过原计划百分之四点八九，商品总值超过原计划百分之七点八四。但是，太原机器厂是采取了什么方法来完成计划的呢？
    严重的不均衡现象
    从完成今年第一季度计划的情况来看，太原机器厂生产的不均衡现象是极严重的。如果第一季度完成的生产总值算作一百，一月份完成百分之十七点四二，二月份完成百分之二十二点零五，三月份则完成了百分之六十点五三。若把第一季度的实作工时作为一百，一月份为百分之二十九点八，二月份为百分之二十六强，三月份则为百分之四十四强。以金工车间为例，假若第一季度完成的生产总值为一百，一月份完成了百分之十一点九一，二月份完成了百分之二十一点八，三月份则完成了百分之六十六点二八。从完成月计划方面看，全厂以三月份的总产值为一百，上半月完成了百分之三十一点四五，下半月则完成了百分之六十八点五。再看金工车间三月份完成计划的情况，如果三月份总产值为一百，该车间上旬完成了百分之十九，中旬完成了百分之二十四，下旬则完成了百分之五十七。金工车间三月份亏欠一万多个工时，熔铸、铁铆两车间超额一万多工时补给了金工车间。部门间不均衡的严重程度可见一般。装配车间在三月二十四日，还没有见到前十部钻探机的零件和七部割煤机的“牵引”，那就是说，这个地方已经停工待料了很久。
    以上所引用的统计数字告诉我们，太原机器厂第一季度计划的完成主要的是在三月份，而三月份又几乎是在最后一旬。这个事实说明了两个问题：（一）企业还蕴藏着很大的潜在能力；（二）生产的不均衡给国家造成了严重的损失。
    不采用突击的办法能否完成生产计划呢？在太原机器厂的主要领导干部和广大职工中间，有两种不同的见解：一种人认为要完成任务就得突击生产；另一种人则认为只要做好组织工作，不突击也可以完成计划。事实可以响亮的回答谁是谁非。    
    突击生产造成的恶果
    太原机器厂是中共太原市委推广五三厂经验的重点厂。在试验五三厂经验过程中，在党的政治思想工作上取得了一些经验，比如在完成计划中组织了党的宣传队伍，提出了“用智慧和时间赛跑”等口号和一些有力的措施，鼓舞了工人群众的劳动热情，对保证完成计划起了相当作用。但是，太原机器厂在完成第一季度计划中采用了三种突击办法，后果很坏。第一、职能部门干部下车间，能上机床的亲自干活，不能上机床的“打杂”。三月二十五日，全厂各职能部门干部都卷入了突击运动，勤务员到车间倒水、添油，工友们问倒水的勤杂人员：“现在倒，以后倒不倒呢？”勤杂人员说：“突击任务时倒，以后就不倒了！”庶务股也抽人到装配车间紧螺丝、刷油。这种办法使工人在突击期间过度紧张，并增加了车间的混乱现象。金工车间好多小组长说：“在三月三十一日，我就不知道我们组的工友都干了些什么，做了多少件。”装配车间的工房放不下那么多人，就把案子搬到院里去干。
    第二、加班加点，妨害了工人的健康。三月份有些工人在星期日不能正当地休息，有些工人星期日轮流休息，在最后几天，有许多工人五点钟上班，八、九点还在工作。特别在最后三天，加班加点更为严重。仅据装配车间统计：全车间八十五人，二十九日有三十五人加班至晚七、八点，三十日有四十七人加班至晚九时多，三十一日有七十七人加班到十二点以后，部分人通夜没睡。有些人形容当时的情景说：“在三十一日晚上十二点钟的时候，装配车间比赶会还热闹。”加班加点所造成的恶果，也是很明显的。金工车间马禄小组的工人武玉贵，在加班当中吐了血。装配车间四月上旬的出勤率，较三月份降低了百分之一点八。
    第三、放松产品检验标准。据检查科统计：三月份铆工次品比上月增加百分之零点四五，金工增加百分之零点三四，工具增加百分之一点二七。以该厂主要产品钻探机的质量为例，铸铁车间次品比上月增加百分之一点九八，铸钢增加百分之八点九九，铆工增加百分之零点五，金工增加百分之一点零七，工具增加百分之三点六五。这还是经过检查的产品，至于没有经过检验直接拿去装配的产品质量到底如何，连检查员也闹不清楚。这种办法所造成的后果就是次品大量入库。
    执行计划前松后紧
    直至现在，太原机器厂还有些领导干部认为三月份突击生产，是个“良好的开端。”让四月上旬完成计划的情况说话吧。据该厂计划科统计：在四月上旬全厂完成本旬计划商品总值百分之五十六点三，生产总值百分之六十六点五九。本月上旬计划没有完成，没问题，又堆到中旬和下旬去了。装配车间主任孟兰焦急地说：“按联系合同规定，在四月十日前，金工车间要拿出五部钻探机的成套零件给我们，可是到了十五日还没有交齐，后半月生产要不紧才见鬼呢？”装配车间党支部书记贾兴旺说的好：“三、四月份的情况一样，如果说四月份比三月份好的话，就是三月份在二十四日才开紧急会议，四月份十四日就开了这样的会议。”这就可以证明并不是“良好的开端”。
    事实证明不突击能够完成计划
    太原机器厂不采用突击手段能不能完成第一季度国家计划呢？事实的回答是不仅能够完成，而且能够均衡地超额完成计划。当然，在机器制造厂实行均衡生产困难是较多些的，比如设备的不平衡，产品零件复杂，质量要求精确等。但是，这些困难是可以克服的。尤其是太原机器厂，去年在实行计划管理方面已经取得了一些经验，比如部件派工、联合小组和编制作业计划等。如果在这些经验的基础上继续提高，生产的均衡性是可以提高的，完成第一季度计划就用不着采用突击的手段了。
    今年第一季度组织均衡生产是有条件的。去年十二月十日，该厂第一次编制了今年第一季度计划，今年一月底又修改了一次，根据最后的定案，割煤机比第一次所订的计划减少了两部，其他产品没有变动，总产值比第一次减少了一亿元。二月中旬该厂自己调整了一次计划，减少了一部分割煤机，增加了一部分钻探机，但总产值没动。今年第一季度生产任务和去年第一季度相比，总产值减少了五亿元。从劳动力利用率来看，第一季度全厂平均只达百分之六十六，金工车间达百分之八十五点三。看来今年第一季度的计划并不是先进的。去年提前两个月完成了一九五二年生产任务，利用这个时间进行一九五三年的各项准备工作再好没有了。如果领导干部头脑清醒，兢兢业业地对待国家计划，完全可以均衡地超额完成第一季度计划，并且超额指标会比突击出来的大得多。但是领导干部却盲目自满，认为满不错了。因此使得应该利用的一个良好条件白白的溜过去了。就拿把丝杠“英制”改“公制”一事来说吧，去年十月就已确定改制，并且定了方案，已委托兄弟厂代制，代制不顺利，中途报废了，领导干部并未想积极办法，结果影响了计划的完成。在技术准备上，制造六十五马力割煤机和大内齿轮样板，原来分配给松原绘制，而松原因病歇工，开头领导干部不知道，后来知道了又不过问，结果延长了一月之久。生产组织极不合理，一月份计划变动后，金工车间缺人，而熔铸车间劳力剩余，领导方面亦未及时加以调整。一月份制造工具很重要，然而，工具车间十一部机床只开了一班。一方面是机器设备能力没有发挥，另一方面又因无工具而停工。各部门工作的安排都离开了生产，有的评选模范，有的扫除文盲，有的编制计划。党委没有统一干部思想，使以上工作围绕生产进行。大家都在忙，却没有人去管生产。二月份又遇春节放假，生产更陷于无人负责中，直到三月上旬，生产仍然处于自流状态，有些车间停工待料（如装配）。当三月二十四日领导方面发现了问题严重，可是第
    一季度的时间只剩下七天了。
    领导干部盲目自满，只满足一般领导、终日忙于事务的官僚主义作风，和靠“突击”完成计划的思想，是实行计划管理进行均衡生产的主要障碍。事实已经作了这样的回答。（原载山西日报）
