    Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: The Beijing Election Committee held its second plenary session on May 27th. The meeting discussed the work plan for the city's basic-level elections and conducted detailed research on the upcoming pilot basic-level election work.
    The meeting decided that the period from early June to mid-July this year will be the preparation period for Beijing's basic-level elections. During this period, key pilot basic-level elections will be carried out, and cadres participating in the election work will be trained. On the basis of completing key pilot projects and gaining experience, city-wide basic-level election work will begin in late July. In order to ensure that the election does not hinder agricultural production in the suburbs, the township elections in the 325 townships in the suburbs will be completed before the autumn harvest. It is expected that the city's basic-level elections will be completed within September.
    In order to do a good job in the city's election work, the meeting emphasized the need to do a good job in publicizing and educating the masses and training cadres. The Beijing Election Committee will select a group of cadres from various agencies and organizations as the backbone based on the principle of emphasizing quality, and will also select students from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Administrative Cadre School and some street and township activists to serve as guidance and technical work for basic-level election work. In early June, cadres participating in key pilot basic-level election work will be trained, and large-scale universal training of cadres will be conducted in mid-July. In terms of publicity work, a variety of methods will be adopted to ensure that every place and everyone receives universal election publicity and education, so as to mobilize voters to actively and enthusiastically participate in this great movement.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of election work, working bodies are established under the municipal and district election committees. The Municipal Election Committee has one secretary-general and four deputy secretaries-general to assist the chairman in handling daily work. An office is also set up under the Election Committee, divided into secretariat, organization and training, publicity, inspection, and general affairs groups; the district election committee also has an office, divided into secretariat, publicity, inspection, and voter qualification review groups. The various tasks of the township and town election committees are the responsibility of each member, and no separate working body is established.
    Beijing's basic-level election pilot work will be carried out in three locations: Anfu Hutong Police Station jurisdiction in Xidan District in the city, Diaoyutai Township in Haidian District in the suburbs of Beijing, and Guanzhuang Township in the eastern suburbs. The Municipal Election Committee will lead this pilot work. The steps are: after the urban pilot work group arrives at the pilot street, it will first help the street where it is located to summarize the experience of democratic political construction, understand the population and various aspects, divide the electoral districts, and at the same time launch publicity work. After in-depth and universal publicity and fully grasping the materials related to voter qualifications in the area, a registration station will be established, a voter qualification review team will be organized, and population registration, voter registration, and distribution of voter certificates will begin. After the voter list is announced, voter groups will be formed, candidates will be discussed and proposed, democracy will be fully promoted, voters will be organized and mobilized under leadership, the official list of representative candidates will be carefully identified and determined, and then a voter meeting will be held for election. In the suburbs, after the work group arrives at the pilot township, it will first arrange production work; then, combine production with the publicity of election work; then, with the work group as the backbone, establish a township election committee, and follow the steps of the urban area to carry out work closely in conjunction with production.
    The 160 cadres participating in the pilot work are now undergoing centralized training; they will arrive in the pilot area on June 8th to start work. The population survey registration books, voter certificates, etc. required for the election work are being actively printed by the Municipal Election Committee.

    北京市布置基层选举工作
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京市选举委员会于五月二十七日举行第二次全体委员会议，会上讨论了全市基层选举的工作计划，并对即将开始的重点试办基层选举工作也作了详细研究。
    会议决定，今年六月初至七月中旬为北京市基层选举的准备工作时间，在这期间要重点试办基层选举并普遍训练参加选举工作的干部。在完成重点试办取得经验的基础上，于七月下旬开始进行全市的基层选举工作。为使选举不妨碍郊区的农业生产，郊区三百二十五个乡的乡选，将于秋收前完成。全市基层选举预计可于九月内进行完毕。
    为作好全市的选举工作，会议强调必须作好对群众的宣传教育与干部的训练工作。北京市选举委员会将根据质量并重的原则，从各机关、团体中抽调一批干部作为骨干，并抽调北京市人民政府行政干部学校的学员与一部分街、乡积极分子，担任基层选举工作的指导工作与技术工作。在六月上旬训练参加重点试办基层选举工作的干部，大规模的普遍训练干部将在七月中旬进行。在宣传工作上，将采取多种多样的方式，务使每一处、每一人都受到普选的宣传教育，以便动员选民积极热烈地参加这一伟大的运动。
    为加强选举工作的领导，市、区选举委员会之下设立办事机构。市选举委员会设秘书长一人，副秘书长四人，协助主席处理日常工作。选举委员会之下并设立办公室，内分秘书、组织训练、宣传、检查、总务等组；区选举委员会也设办公室，内分秘书、宣传、检查、选民资格审查等四组。乡、镇选举委员会的各项工作，由各委员分工负责，不另设办事机构。
    北京市的基层选举试办工作，将在城内西单区安福胡同派出所管界内、京郊海淀区钓鱼台乡、东郊区关庄乡三个地点进行。市选举委员会将领导这一试办工作。步骤是：在城区试点工作组到达试点街道后，首先帮助所在街道总结民主建政的经验，了解人口与各方面的情况，划分选区，同时展开宣传工作。在深入普遍宣传并充分掌握该地有关选民资格的材料后，即建立登记站，组织选民资格审查小组，开始办理人口登记、选民登记和分发选民证。选民名单公布后，分编选民小组，酝酿提出候选人，充分发扬民主，有领导的组织和发动选民，认真鉴别并确定代表候选人的正式名单，然后召开选民大会进行选举。在郊区，工作组到达试点乡后，首先将生产工作安排好；接着，结合生产展开选举工作的宣传；然后以工作组为骨干成立乡选举委员会，按照城区的步骤，密切结合生产进行工作。
    现在参加试点工作的一百六十个干部正进行集中训练；他们在六月八日可到达试点地区开始工作。选举工作中所需用的人口调查登记册、选民证等，市选举委员会正积极印制中。
