Xinhua News Agency, London, May 14th: TASS London, May 14th: During the foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons on May 11th, the first to speak from the opposition party was former Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Noel-Baker. He said that if negotiations on Korea and other issues were to begin, he hoped the Prime Minister would arrange for the negotiations to be conducted by responsible ministers. Noel-Baker said that the British government should use its maximum influence to ensure the "prompt and effective implementation" of the UN resolution unanimously adopted regarding the demand for the withdrawal of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops from Burma.

He said: "If Taiwan continues to be armed to fight against Beijing, then it is absurd to hope to reach agreements in Korea, Indochina, and Malaya."

He hoped that Churchill would persuade the US President to stop shipping weapons to Taiwan.

John Strachey, former Secretary of State for War in the Labour government, said that Britain should issue a public statement saying that if the armistice negotiations were to be disrupted under the current circumstances, world opinion would not condemn the Korean-Chinese representatives, but the Americans. According to a Reuters report, Strachey said that in the current extremely important stage of the armistice negotiations, the US side has done nothing but nitpick on details.

Strachey said that after the Korean armistice, Britain should support the "true government of China" to participate in the United Nations Security Council. This would be a sign that the United States had abandoned its "attitude of interfering in China," which is "the real key to the entire situation in the Far East."

Strachey continued, the British government must make it clear by "actions and words" that it opposes this attitude. The Prime Minister has already done so in words today, but concrete actions should follow.

"We cannot fail to express our opinions on such a major issue. If we do not express our opinions, then we will have fallen from the status of an independent country to that of a satellite state."

Woodrow Wyatt, former Under-Secretary of State for War in the Labour government, said that if the United States continues to oppose the People's Republic of China's participation in the Security Council, Britain should be prepared to "vote against the United States in the United Nations."

    前英国陆军大臣斯特拉彻等发言
    指责美方在朝鲜停战谈判中吹毛求疵
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社伦敦十四日讯：五月十一日英国下院进行外交辩论时，反对党首先发言的是前联邦关系大臣诺尔—贝克。他说，如果关于朝鲜及其他问题的谈判开始的话，他希望首相将设法使谈判由负责的部长们进行。诺尔—贝克说，英国政府应使用它最大的影响以保证联合国一致通过的关于要求蒋介石匪军自缅甸撤走的决议“迅速和有效地予以实施”。
    他说：“如果继续武装台湾来和北京作战，那么，希望能在朝鲜、印度支那和马来亚获得协议是荒谬的。”
    他希望邱吉尔将劝服美国总统不要再运武器给台湾。
    前工党政府的陆军大臣约翰·斯特拉彻说，英国应公开发表声明说：如果停战谈判在目前情势下遭受破坏的话，世界舆论将不谴责朝中代表，而是谴责美国人。据路透社消息，斯特拉彻说，在停战谈判目前极端重要的阶段中，美方除了在细节上吹毛求疵外一无作为。
    斯特拉彻说，在朝鲜停战后，英国应支持“中国的真正政府”参加联合国的安全理事会。这将是一个迹象，表示美国放弃了它的“干涉中国的态度”，而这种态度是“远东整个局势的真正关键”。
    斯特拉彻继续说，英国政府必须以“行动和言语”明白表示它反对这种态度。首相今天已经用言语表示这样做了，但接着就应该采取具体的行动。
    “在这样重大的问题上，我们不能不发表我们的意见。如果我们不发表我们的意见，那么，我们就是从一个独立国的地位降落到一个卫星国的地位。”
    前工党政府的陆军部驻议会次官伍德罗·怀阿特说，如果美国继续反对中华人民共和国参加安全理事会，英国应准备“在联合国中投票反对美国”。
