Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th (TASS dispatch): “Pravda” observer, Prishevsky, commenting on the communiqué of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, said: In the communiqué, the Standing Committee welcomes the action of the International Committee of the World People’s Peace Congress in sending the World People’s Peace Congress's letter to the governments of the five major powers, calling for consultations among the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, to the governments of various countries. Based on the policy of consolidating peace and international cooperation, the Soviet government has announced its support for the World People's Peace Congress's letter to the governments of the five major powers and the suggestions contained therein. The governments of the People's Republic of China, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic also fully support the World People's Peace Congress's letter to the governments of the five major powers. The attitude taken by the governments of these countries is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries. The people of all countries are increasingly firmly demanding: lasting peace must be achieved, and all disputed international issues must be resolved through consultation.

Prishevsky then cited examples to illustrate the recent development of the peace movement of the people in capitalist countries. On May 5, a peace advocates' conference was held in Paris, and the speakers at the meeting unanimously demanded that the French government respond to and endorse the letter from the International Committee of the World People's Peace Congress.

A peace action conference will be held in Manchester, England, on May 16th and 17th, and preparations for the conference are currently underway throughout Britain. A peace advocates meeting was held in Gujarat, India, in early May, at which measures to safeguard and consolidate world peace were unanimously adopted. The first American Continental Cultural Congress recently held in Santiago, Chile, also became a great demonstration demanding peace, national independence, and democratic freedom.

Prishevsky quoted the communiqué of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council as saying: "Due to recent events, the idea of consultation has gained the support of millions more people." These events tell the people of all countries that they can use their actions to ease international tensions. Prishevsky emphasized that the people are convinced that any disputed or unresolved international issues can be resolved. This confidence has been heightened since the resolution of the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war in Korea. Other issues can certainly be resolved just as successfully. This prospect encourages the people of all countries to strive for peace. They know that the more resolutely the millions of people in all countries demand a peaceful settlement of disputes, the faster and more successfully this goal can be achieved.

Prishevsky concluded by saying that there are some forces in the world that are openly or covertly trying to prevent the easing of international tensions. This is fundamentally not in their interests, because once international tensions ease, military appropriations will be reduced accordingly, and as a result, the profits of the monopoly capitalists engaged in arms production will fall. At the same time, the restoration of normal trade relations between countries is also unfavorable to these people, because they can force their partners to accept monopoly prices by prohibiting normal trade relations between countries, and thus obtain huge profits. However, although these people may be powerful and influential, they are ultimately only a negligible minority in society. Just as the communiqué of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council correctly points out: "The common sense and vigilance of peace-loving people are capable of defeating this force."

    “真理报”评世界和平理事会常委会公报指出
    各国人民愈来愈坚决地要求协商解决争端
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：“真理报”观察家普利歇夫斯基评论世界和平理事会常务委员会斯德哥尔摩会议的公报说：常务委员会在公报中，对于世界人民和平大会国际委员会已把世界人民和平大会要求五大国进行协商以缔结和平公约的致五大国政府书送交各国政府这一行动，表示欢迎。苏联政府本着巩固和平与国际合作的政策，已经宣布支持世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书和其中的建议。中华人民共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国的政府也同样完全支持世界人民和平大会的致五大国政府书。这些国家的政府采取的态度是符合一切国家的人民的愿望的。各国人民愈来愈坚决地要求：必须获得持久和平，一切争执的国际问题必须用协商方式来解决。
    普利歇夫斯基接着举例说明了资本主义国家人民和平运动最近的开展情况。五月五日，巴黎举行了一个和平拥护者大会，会上的发言者一致要求法国政府答复并赞成世界人民和平大会国际委员会的来信。
    英国曼彻斯特将在五月十六日和十七日举行和平行动大会，目前英国各地正在进行大会的筹备工作。印度古吉莱特在五月初举行了和平拥护者会议，会上一致通过了维护与巩固世界和平的措施。最近在智利的圣地亚哥举行的第一届美洲大陆文化大会也成为要求和平、民族独立与民主自由的巨大示威。
    普利歇夫斯基引世界和平理事会常务委员会的公报说：“由于最近的事件，协商的主张又获得了另外千百万人的拥护。”这些事件告诉各国人民，他们可以用自己的行动使国际紧张局势缓和下来。普利歇夫斯基强调说，人民深信，任何争执中或悬而未决的国际问题都是能够解决的。在朝鲜交换病伤战俘问题解决后，这种信心愈加高了。其他问题当然也是能够同样成功地得到解决的。这种前景鼓舞着各国人民去争取和平。他们知道，所有国家中的千百万人民愈是坚决地要求和平解决争端，就能够更快与更成功地达到这个目标。
    普利歇夫斯基最后说，世界上有一些势力公开地或隐蔽地在设法阻止国际紧张局势的缓和。因为这是根本不符合他们的利益的。因为国际紧张局势缓和后，军事拨款就将随之削减，结果，从事军火生产的垄断资本家的利润就将下降。同时，使各国之间的贸易关系恢复正常，对这些人也是不利的，因为他们用禁止各国间发生正常贸易关系的办法，就可以强迫他们的伙伴接受垄断价格，而从中获得巨额利润。然而，尽管这些人可能是有力量的和有影响的，但是他们在社会上究竟只是微不足道的少数。正像世界和平理事会常务委员会的公报中正确地指出的：“爱好和平的人们的常识和警惕性是能够使这种势力失败的。”
