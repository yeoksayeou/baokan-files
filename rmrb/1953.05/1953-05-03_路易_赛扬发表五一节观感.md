    Louis Saillant's Impressions of May Day
    World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Louis Saillant received a Xinhua News Agency reporter here on the 2nd and made the following remarks on the Beijing celebration of International Labor Day:
    Beijing celebrated May Day in a festive atmosphere, which in my opinion is proof that China's new political and social regime has laid a deep foundation in the hearts of the people.
    I was amazed by the Chinese people's enthusiastic expression of their joy for their new life. Their heartfelt joy and unwavering confidence in their government and their beloved leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, on the glorious international workers' holiday, is truly moving to witness.
    To me, this proves that China possesses a tremendous patriotic people's strength, a vigorous force vividly combined with the great reality of proletarian internationalism.
    After spending this May Day of 1953 with and among the Chinese people, I will look forward to the future with even greater and firmer confidence. (Xinhua News Agency)

    路易·赛扬发表五一节观感
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬二日在此间接见新华社记者，就北京欢庆五一国际劳动节发表谈话说：
    北京在节日的气氛中欢庆五一节，这在我看来是中国新政治和社会政权在人民心中奠定了深厚基础的证明。
    中国人民热情地表达他们对于新生活的喜悦，他们的热情使我惊奇。他们在光辉无比的国际工人的节日，对他们的政府和他们的热爱的领袖毛泽东同志所表现的满怀喜悦和坚定信心的敬意，是使人看了不能不为之感动的。
    对我来说，这证明了中国有一种巨大的爱国主义的人民的力量，一种与无产阶级国际主义的伟大现实生动结合起来而显出的蓬勃力量。
    在我与中国人民一道并在他们中间渡过这个一九五三年五一节以后，我将以更大更坚定的信心瞩望将来。　（新华社）
