Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 21st: The Korean Workers' Party Publishing House recently published the Korean translation of Mao Zedong's philosophical work "On Contradiction" as a separate volume. Previously, the Korean translation of "On Contradiction" was published in full in the July 1952 issue of the Korean magazine "People."

The "Rodong Sinmun," the central organ of the Korean Workers' Party, in reporting the publication of "On Contradiction," gave a brief introduction to the content of "On Contradiction" and commented: In this philosophical essay, Comrade Mao Zedong thoroughly exposed and criticized idealism and dogmatic ideology, and at the same time appropriately and richly applied the basic propositions of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and developed them in accordance with historical facts. Comrade Mao Zedong concretely combined Marxism-Leninism with reality, and at the same time refuted mechanical materialism and put forward the task of militant materialism. Comrade Mao Zedong also analyzed and summarized the transformation and experience of the Chinese revolution after the Xinhai Revolution based on domestic and foreign conditions and Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Thoroughly studying "On Contradiction," which summarizes Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary theory and strategy and tactics, is of great significance for us to practice Marxism-Leninism in our work and life to further promote victory.

    朝鲜出版毛主席著作“矛盾论”单行本
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜劳动党出版社最近已经出版了毛泽东的哲学著作“矛盾论”的朝鲜文译本单行本。在此以前，“矛盾论”的朝鲜文译文曾在朝鲜“人民”杂志一九五二年七月号上全文发表。
    朝鲜劳动党中央机关报“劳动新闻”在报道“矛盾论”出版的消息中对“矛盾论”的内容作了扼要的介绍，并评论说：毛泽东同志在这篇哲学论文中，对观念论和教条主义思想作了彻底的暴露和批判，同时还适当而丰富地运用了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论的基本命题，并与历史事实相适应地发展了它。毛泽东同志把马克思—列宁主义和现实作了具体的结合，同时驳斥了机械的唯物论，提出了战斗的唯物论的任务。毛泽东同志并根据国内外的条件和马克思—列宁主义的哲学，分析和总结了辛亥革命以后的中国革命的转变和经验。我们透彻地学习概括着毛泽东同志的革命理论和战略战术的“矛盾论”，对我们在工作和生活中实践马克思—列宁主义来进一步促进胜利，有着巨大的意义。
