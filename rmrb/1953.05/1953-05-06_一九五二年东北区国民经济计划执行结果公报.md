In 1952, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, the people of Northeast China victoriously carried out the great “Three-Anti” and “Five-Anti” movements and extensively and deeply promoted the patriotic production increase and thrift movement. On this basis, the annual plan was successfully completed. The main implementation of the 1952 national economic plan for the entire Northeast region is now announced as follows:

I. Achievements in Industrial Production

(1) Industrial Production Exceeded the Plan

In 1952, the total industrial output value of the entire region completed 110% of the plan. State-owned industries completed 110.7% of the plan. Among them: the production of means of production completed 110.8% of the plan; the production of consumer goods completed 108.1% of the plan. The completion percentage of the annual total output value plan for state-owned industries and local state-owned industries is as follows:

The industrial enterprises directly under the former Northeast Industrial Department totaled 112% of the plan, including: Anshan Iron and Steel Company 112%, Benxi Coal and Iron Company 115%, Electricity Administration 101%, Coal Mining Administration 113%, Fushun Mining Bureau 102%, Nonferrous Metals Administration 115%, Chemical Industry Administration 125%, Petroleum Industry Administration 131%, Mechanical Industry Administration 124%, Electrical Industry Administration 124%, Building Materials Industry Administration 109%, Light Industry Administration 103%, Textile Industry Administration 103%.

The industrial enterprises directly under other ministries and bureaus totaled 105% of the plan, including: Ministry of Forestry 125%, Ministry of Trade 91%, Northeast Office of the Ministry of Railways 105%, Ministry of Health 85%, Ministry of Culture 52%, Postal and Telecommunications Bureau 140%, Inland River Navigation Bureau 115%.

Local state-owned industries totaled 113% of the plan, including: Shenyang City 105%, Lushun-Dalian City 102%, Fushun City 145%, Anshan City 117%, Benxi City 110%, Liaodong Province 121%, Liaoxi Province 121%, Jilin Province 110%, Songjiang Province 124%, Heilongjiang Province 103%, Rehe Province 92%.

In May 1952, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the people of Northeast China, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production and practice thrift," formulated a plan to increase production and save wealth equivalent to 8 million tons of grain in addition to completing the state plan, and launched a deeper and more extensive large-scale patriotic production increase and thrift movement. This movement played a great role in completing and overfulfilling the plan. After completing the state plan, all state-owned industries in the region completed the production and savings of wealth equivalent to 11.31 million tons of grain (excluding savings in capital construction), of which 8.32 million tons were increased production and 2.99 million tons were savings.

(2) Growth of Industrial Output

The growth of important industrial products is as follows (percentage increase in 1952 output compared to 1951):

Percentage increase: Pig iron 23, steel ingots 38, steel 32, coal 30, power generation 45, shale oil 43, copper 10, lead 32, sulfur 41, nitric acid 68, sulfuric acid 13, nitric acid 42, soda ash 47, electric motors 91, machine tools 150, freight cars 37, ball bearings 139, light bulbs 69, logs 74, paper 92, cement 25, glass 15, bricks 362, rubber shoes 7, cotton yarn 24, cotton cloth 24, blankets 82, sacks 38, knitwear 69, cigarettes 50, salt 27, flour 121, sugar 11.

In 1952, the total industrial output value of the entire region increased by 47% compared to 1951. The total output value of all state-owned industries increased by 53% compared to 1951, of which the Ministry of Industry increased by 47%; other ministries and bureaus increased by 53%; and local state-owned industries increased by 65%.

The production of means of production increased by 54% compared to 1951 (of which the machinery manufacturing sector increased by 61%), and the production of consumer goods increased by 49% compared to 1951. The development of the production of means of production occupies a priority position, and its proportion continues to increase, reaching 67.5% of the total industrial output value in 1952 (65.9% in 1951).

Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, due to the increase in state-entrusted processing tasks, the production of private industries has also increased significantly, with its total output value increasing by 9.4% compared to the previous year.

(3) Improvement of Industrial Production Technology and Production Management

Due to the creative labor of the working class and the assistance of advanced Soviet science and technology, the technical level of industry has been further improved. First, the machinery manufacturing sector trial-produced dozens of new products, such as 3,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generators (in 1951, only 800-kilowatt generators could be produced), 600-kilowatt electric motors, 5,000-kilovolt-ampere transformers, 6,000-ton-per-year long-net paper machines, and several new types of machine tools. The degree of mechanization of production is also increasing. For example, coal mining industry began to use coal cutting machines and combined coal cutting machines and other equipment, steel production appeared anti-encirclement disc and other mechanical automation. Due to the improvement of equipment and advanced experience in production management, not only the labor productivity increased, but more importantly, the harsh working conditions left over from the puppet Manchukuo were completely improved.

In the black metallurgy sector, due to the effective implementation of advanced experiences such as "full air, fast feed, smooth operation method" and "fast steelmaking operation method," the steel output per square meter of hearth bottom area of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's open-hearth furnace increased by 23% compared to the previous year, and the utilization of the effective area of the blast furnace increased by 17%.

In the power industry, due to the implementation of advanced methods such as rapid maintenance, unified maintenance, load adjustment, and electricity conservation, the equipment utilization rate has been greatly improved, and electricity has been used more rationally. The equipment utilization rate increased by 41% compared to the previous year; load adjustment and electricity conservation alone saved electricity equivalent to 40,000 kilowatts of equipment.

In the coal mining industry, due to the rational adjustment of labor organization, the implementation of periodic coal mining method, and the vigorous promotion of the "Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team Experience," the coal mining bureau's overall efficiency increased by 25% compared to the previous year, and it continued to overcome the shortcomings of tunneling lagging behind production.

In the machinery manufacturing sector, the promotion of advanced experiences such as high-speed cutting, multi-tool multi-blade cutting, "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," and the creation of the Yang Shoushun casting method played a significant reform role in the machinery industry.

In the light industry sector, the promotion of the "rapid cooking method" and "sectional maintenance method" in the paper industry greatly increased the production of paper. As a result of the promotion of the "Li Chuanjiang oil extraction method" in the oil refining industry, the oil yield of soybean oil increased from 10.5% to 12.5%.

Due to the promotion of advanced operating experience, on the one hand, the raw material consumption quota of industrial production was reduced compared to 1951, thus saving a large amount of important fuels and materials such as coal, electricity, wood, and copper; on the other hand, labor productivity increased, with labor productivity of state-owned industries increasing by 14%, of which units under the former Ministry of Industry increased by 22%, and local state-owned industries increased by 13%. Due to the reduction of raw material consumption quota and the increase of labor productivity, the production cost of all state-owned industries decreased by 12% compared to the previous year.

In 1952, there were also many improvements in industrial production in terms of production management, product quality, safety and welfare, but this improvement was relatively slow and unbalanced. In particular, the management level of enterprises still lags behind the requirements of production development, and many enterprises lack the idea of comprehensively completing the state plan. First of all, it is reflected in the inability to complete the state production plan in a balanced manner, with the situation of being lax at the beginning and tight at the end, and rushing production being common. Many products often fail to complete the monthly plan and need to rush the task in the next month. Some individual enterprises have failed to complete the plan for three consecutive quarters, and in the fourth quarter, they have to use one-quarter of the time to complete one-third of the annual plan. Rushing production has resulted in poor quality, increased waste, increased accidents, and increased costs, and has affected the on-time completion of the state plan.

Secondly, the quality of many products cannot meet the needs of national construction and the people's growing needs. Due to the poor quality of many products and the variety not meeting the needs of the people, a backlog of some industrial products has been created. Some factories and mines even violate the quality standards stipulated by the state and manufacture substandard and technically substandard goods for the people. For example, the quality of rubber products does not meet the standards, which seriously affects sales and expansion of production; although the quality of mechanical products is constantly improving, the scrap rate of some important parts is still very high.

Again, many enterprises have not paid enough attention to safety and welfare work, and therefore, production accidents have increased compared to the previous year. For example, the number of power industry accidents increased by 13.5% compared to the previous year, and most of them were major liability accidents, of which 18 were only major equipment damage and major power outages. In the coal mining industry, the worker casualty rate increased by 20% compared to the previous year. There has also been an increase in occupational poisoning and occupational diseases among employees in the chemical industry. In the textile industry, most of the ventilation equipment is poor, the temperature in the workshop is very high in summer, and the working conditions are harsh. This phenomenon of neglecting safety production and workers' living welfare is intolerable.

All economic leadership departments, especially local state-owned industrial departments, must effectively overcome the above-mentioned serious shortcomings in future work in order to further improve the level of industrial production.

II. Development of Agricultural Production

In 1952, the entire region achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production, which greatly improved the grain supply situation and further improved the living standards of farmers. The sowing area of the entire region completed 99% of the plan, an increase of 2.1% compared to the previous year. The total agricultural output value of the entire region completed 101% of the plan, an increase of 22% compared to the previous year, of which crops increased by 24%, animal husbandry increased by 13%, and aquatic products increased by 50%. The output of major crops: grain reached 21 million tons, an increase of 4 million tons compared to the previous year, with coarse grains increasing by 25% compared to the previous year, and soybeans increasing by 9%; ginned cotton reached 94,000 tons.

The agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in the entire region has been further developed. Organized farmers have become the majority in rural areas. There are already 542 state-owned farms, of which 29 are mechanized farms. Some state-owned farms have played a certain role in helping farmers improve technology. The pilot agricultural production cooperatives and a few collective farms have had a profound and positive impact on the vast number of farmers. Six collective farms have been established. Agricultural production cooperatives have developed to 1,307, and their output is generally much higher than that of labor mutual aid groups and individual farmers. There are 520,000 permanent and three-season mutual aid groups, with improved quality compared to the past. There are 377,000 temporary mutual aid groups.

The large-scale application of new technologies in agriculture has promoted farmers to gradually move towards the road of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, and the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement has created favorable conditions for the promotion of new technologies. In 1952, the entire region promoted 38,000 new farm implements, including 3,170 sets of horse-drawn farm implements and 25,000 integrated hoe machines. Fifty-one agricultural technology promotion stations were established, mainly using new farm implements. 40,000 sprayers, 3,500 tons of pesticides, and 49,000 tons of ammonium sulfate were promoted. The fertilization area of crops reached 10.7 million hectares, an increase of 12% compared to 1951 (the same below); the popularization area of improved varieties was 1.68 million hectares, an increase of 168%; the seed disinfection area was 1.3 million hectares, an increase of 10%. The output per unit area has been significantly improved, and new records of high output have been created. The highest yield of sorghum per hectare has reached 15,000 catties; soybeans have reached 9,150 catties; wheat 8,050 catties; rice 20,000 catties; cotton 8,419 catties. In particular, Zhaoyuan County promoted the advanced cultivation method of "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, seedling protection, and phased topdressing," creating the experience of high yield on nearly 10,000 hectares of large-scale farmland, which is worth vigorously promoting.

Due to the protection and breeding of livestock, the total number of draft animals in the entire region increased by 11% compared to the previous year, of which horses increased by 8% and cattle increased by 15%. Sheep increased by 49% and pigs increased by 15%.

Afforestation and forest protection work continued to expand. This year, 103,000 hectares of protective forest belts were built in the western region, an increase of 4.2 times compared to the previous year. The masses in the entire region planted 52 million trees, an increase of 21% compared to the previous year.

In terms of water conservancy construction, the fundamental treatment project of the Raoyang River is underway for the preparation of soil and water conservation and reservoir construction in the upper reaches, and the technical design and construction preparation work for the Dahuo房 Reservoir project of the Liaohe River have begun. The entire region has increased paddy fields by 4,000 hectares, and the area of paddy fields has reached 320,000 hectares. Due to the construction of water conservancy, natural disasters have been greatly reduced compared to the previous year.

There are many shortcomings in agricultural production, mainly: in promoting the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, many areas have not implemented the party and government's policy of active leadership and steady progress, and many cadres have developed some impetuous emotions and ideas of greed and rash advancement. There is some one-sidedness in production leadership, with a tight grip on advanced parts, while neglecting leadership over intermediate and backward parts.

The work of state-owned farms is not satisfactory. The leaders of the farms have serious ideas of supply-based management. Many farms have the shortcomings of low output, high cost, and large waste; mechanical equipment lacks due maintenance and repair work, and efficiency cannot be fully utilized, and fuel and oil consumption is excessive; cultivation and harvesting are very rough, causing losses; some farms build unnecessary non-productive facilities, instead of focusing on production work; the operation area and rotation system have not been formally established, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible and chaos is quite serious.

In terms of the manufacture and promotion of new farm implements, some of the quality does not meet the standards, and the quality of some important parts is very bad. The promotion of new farm implements is not timely, and there is a backlog. The use, storage, repair, and matching of new farm implements are not good, and therefore, their effectiveness cannot be fully utilized.

There have been some deviations in the operation, management, and product distribution of agricultural production cooperatives. Some agricultural production cooperatives have accumulated too much public property, too many loans, a large spread, and too much accumulation of public welfare funds, which has affected the income of the members. Accounting work is weak, accounts are chaotic, the calculation of labor days is unreasonable, and the proportion of dividends for land, vehicles, horses, and labor is unreasonable, which affects the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives. Although the above-mentioned shortcomings have been corrected at any time, they still need to be further improved.

There are many shortcomings in the work of organizing the Ximan Protective Forest Belt: the implementation plan has no focus; there is a lack of strict responsibility system according to the region; the regulations on the area of the forest network are generalized and do not meet the requirements of different conditions; the survival rate of tree planting in some areas is very low; management work is chaotic, and so on.

In future work, agricultural leading agencies at all levels must pay full attention to and effectively eliminate these shortcomings in order to further improve the level of agricultural production work.

III. Expansion of Capital Construction and Growth of Strength

In 1952, the total amount of capital construction work in the entire region completed 91% of the annual plan, an increase of 72% compared to the previous year. Among them: the former Northeast Industrial Department system completed 93% of the plan, an increase of 138% compared to the previous year; other ministries and bureaus completed 85% of the plan, an increase of 11%; provinces and cities completed 84% of the plan, an increase of 19% compared to the previous year. The floor area of buildings increased by 40% compared to the previous year.

Several major construction projects of great significance to our country's industrialization, such as the Anshan large steel plant, seamless steel pipe plant, Fuxin open-pit mine, and Fuxin power plant, all exceeded the expected progress and basically ensured the quality of the project. As a result of the implementation of the capital construction plan, many new technology and equipment have participated in production, so that the production capacity of industrial, transportation and other departments has been greatly increased.

The gathering and rapid growth of capital construction forces in the Northeast region is the main feature of capital construction work in 1952. Each administration and its affiliated enterprises, as well as the units of each province and city, have gradually established and initially improved the capital construction leading agencies, so that the capital construction management work has been gradually unified and strengthened. The construction forces of surveying, design, construction, and installation have rapidly grown. The number of capital construction workers in the entire region has reached 430,000, of which 120,000 are fixed workers, an increase of 1.7 times compared to last year. Measures such as winter construction, construction industrialization, mechanization, design standardization, and expansion of fixed technical workers have played a great role in increasing capital construction forces.

Capital construction workers have created and learned many advanced experiences in the patriotic production increase and thrift movement, with a total of 21 important ones, including 3 in civil engineering and construction, 11 in mechanical installation, 3 in mine wells, and 4 in geological drilling. These experiences have greatly improved work efficiency, ensured project quality, and reduced costs. For example, the "New Building Design Standard" of the Design Company of the Ministry of Industry improved work efficiency by 40%; the "Foundation Bolt Installation Method" of Angang improved work efficiency by 4 times and ensured technical accuracy; Su Changyou's bricklaying method increased from 700 to 800 bricks per day to 1,300 to 1,400 bricks, and ensured quality; Wang Sunci's "Segmented Parallel Flow Operation Method" shortened the completion of a three-story building of 3,000 square meters from the original plan of 120 days to 39 days.

Capital construction is a new, complex and arduous work. Although important experience was gained in 1952, there are still many shortcomings. Capital construction work is not fully prepared, and material allocation is not timely. General projects do not start until June, which is two months late.

The strength of surveying and design is still very weak. There is a shortage of geological staff, the technical level is very low, and the equipment for engineering geology is also very insufficient. The design force that has been gathered still cannot meet the needs, and some designs are of poor quality, even with design errors, which are modified midway, reducing the project quality and increasing the project cost.

In terms of construction management, there is a phenomenon of no one being responsible. Some construction sites lack technical operating procedures or have operating procedures but have not been implemented, which affects the project quality; the labor organization of many construction sites is unreasonable, and the phenomenon of idling often occurs; there are still many unsatisfactory facts in the safety and welfare work of capital construction workers.

In capital construction, the economic accounting system is poorly implemented, and some leaders pay attention to "good" and "fast" while ignoring "saving"; the management of equipment and materials and financial supervision are still unsound, resulting in great waste.

In future work, the leading agencies of capital construction at all levels must fully pay attention to and effectively improve the above-mentioned shortcomings, further strengthen the capital construction forces, improve the level of capital construction work, and accelerate the progress of national industrial construction.

IV. Expansion of State-Owned Trade and Cooperative Commodity Circulation

With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase of people's purchasing power, state-owned trade and cooperatives in Northeast China steadily expanded the volume of commodity circulation in 1952. The total sales of state-owned trade completed 97% of the plan, an increase of 76% compared to 1951. Among them: domestic sales completed 103% of the plan, an increase of 119%; sales outside the region completed 70% of the plan, an increase of 29%. The total purchase amount completed 103% of the plan, an increase of 53% compared to 1951. Among them: domestic purchases completed 111% of the plan, an increase of 79%; purchases outside the region completed 94% of the plan, an increase of 110%.

The percentage of completion of the sales volume of various major commodities in the region is as follows: cotton yarn 114; cotton cloth 107; cotton batting 152; coarse grains 113; fine grains 130; pork 486; coal 124; timber 300; soybean oil 82; kerosene 83; matches 59.

The sales volume of cooperatives in the entire region completed 128% of the plan, an increase of 163 compared to 1951. Cooperatives paid special attention to the supply of farmers' means of production. The purchase amount of agricultural and sideline products completed 100% of the plan, an increase of 135% compared to 1951.

In 1952, the retail sales of state-owned trade and cooperatives accounted for 63% of the total social retail sales; the wholesale business also had considerable development. The leading role of state-owned and cooperative trade in the entire social commodity circulation has been further strengthened, effectively ensuring the needs of society and maintaining the stability of prices. The total price index of public and private enterprises in the entire region as of the end of December was 100.4% of the same period last year.

There are many shortcomings in commodity circulation work, mainly: lack of investigation and research on the people's needs and market supply, inaccurate and untimely procurement and allocation work, resulting in a large backlog of some commodities, and some commodities being out of stock, failing to ensure sufficient supply; poor operation and management, and the supply-based management thinking is still very serious, mainly manifested in slow capital turnover, high expenses, chaotic accounts, unclear responsibilities, and lax discipline.

In future work, commercial leading departments at all levels must resolutely and step by step eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings in order to further improve operation and management, implement the economic accounting system, and improve the level of commercial work.

V. Development of Transportation

With the development of industry, agriculture, and the expansion of trade, transportation has developed accordingly.

The railway transportation volume (number of tons sent) completed 104% of the plan, an increase of 16% compared to the previous year; the total number of loaded cars completed 101% of the plan, an increase of 10% compared to the previous year. The percentage of completion of major goods is as follows: coal 101, steel 97, mineral building materials 111, timber 104, grain 107. The technical quota has also been improved. The number of cars loaded per day completed 101% of the plan; the vehicle turnover rate overfulfilled the plan by 2.99 days, an increase of 8.3% compared to the previous year; the full load, over-axis, and 500-kilometer movement carried out on the entire line improved transportation efficiency and improved management work.

The total volume of inland river freight completed 107% of the plan, an increase of 22% compared to the previous year. Road transportation completed 109% of the plan, an increase of 82% compared to the previous year.

The volume of postal business completed 83% of the plan, of which telegrams completed 85% of the plan and telephones completed 82% of the plan. There are shortcomings in the postal and telecommunications plan that are not realistic; serious coercive apportionment and deviations from the masses have occurred in the postal and telecommunications work in expanding business, and they must be resolutely corrected in the future.

VI. Development of Culture and Municipal Construction

Education in Northeast China has been further developed. The total number of students reached 6.78 million, an increase of 23% compared to the previous year. Among them: the number of college students reached 38,000, an increase of 39%; the number of middle school students reached 480,000, an increase of 84%; the number of students in technical schools reached 66,000, an increase of 1.3 times; and the number of primary school students reached 6.26 million, an increase of 19%.

The number of books published in the entire region was 115 million, an increase of 18% compared to the previous year. The number of newspapers distributed was 305 million copies, an increase of 62%, of which the circulation of Northeast Daily reached 90 million copies. 360 films were distributed in the entire region. The number of moviegoers was 76 million, an increase of 33% compared to the previous year.

In 1952, the health work in the entire region also made great progress. In order to oppose the bacteriological warfare waged by US imperialism, the entire region carried out a mass-based large-scale patriotic health movement and achieved great victories. There were 4,200 health care institutions, and the number of beds increased by 5,000, reaching a total of 27,000 beds. Epidemic prevention injections were generally implemented, with 32.95 million people injected, which greatly reduced the harm of infectious diseases. Sports activities in the entire region have been significantly developed, and the people's physical fitness is gradually being enhanced.

Under the guidance of facing the working class and serving production, urban public utilities have done a lot of work in reconstructing roads, expanding urban bus and streetcar services, reconstructing tap water and underground sewers, digging canals, planting trees, expanding parks, and improving gas and heat supply, and have started the overall planning of industrial cities.

In cultural, educational, and health work, there are shortcomings in emphasizing the increase in quantity and neglecting quality; medical and health personnel are still insufficient, and efforts should be made to improve and strengthen the teaching effect and medical and health care organization work in the future.

VII. Improvement of People's Material Life

With the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production, the material life of the working people has also been gradually improved.

In 1952, the number of employees in the entire region increased by 350,000 compared to the previous year. The basic wages of employees increased by 9% compared to the previous year (excluding 20% for rent, water, and electricity), and many employees received excess rewards due to the general implementation of the piece-rate wage system. In addition, the additional wages for cultural and welfare undertakings paid by the state in proportion to the total wage fund also increased significantly compared to the previous year. The entire region built 1.69 million square meters of new dormitories for employees, an increase of 82% compared to the previous year.

The lives of farmers have also continued to improve. In 1952, farmers' grain income increased by 4 million tons compared to the previous year. As a result of rationally increasing grain prices and reducing industrial product prices, farmers have gained great benefits.

Due to the improvement of the lives of urban and rural people, the sales volume of state-owned trade in the region increased significantly compared to the previous year: cotton cloth increased by 41%; rubber shoes increased by 1.7 times; toilet soap increased by 1 times, soap increased by 1.3 times; granulated sugar increased by 53%; towels increased by 52%; socks increased by 1.1 times. The urban and rural working people are constantly growing new demands for the quality and variety of commodities.

The over-fulfillment of the national economic plan of Northeast China in 1952 further strengthened the economic and defense forces of our motherland. On the basis of production growth, the living standards of industrial and agricultural workers have been improved and raised. In 1952, industrial and agricultural production has recovered and exceeded the highest historical year (1943). Industrial and agricultural production exceeded 1943 by 32%. Among them: industrial production exceeded by 23%; agricultural production exceeded by 47%. In the four years since 1949, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Northeast China have healed the wounds suffered by the national economy during the war, ended the work of the economic recovery period, and begun to carry out large-scale economic construction with emphasis and step by step. This fact fully proves the superiority and its unlimited vitality of the new democratic social system and economic system. The people of Northeast China are now full of confidence to welcome the first annual plan of the first five-year plan of national construction!

      一九五二年全区工业总产值比一九五一年增长百分之四十七。全部国营工业总产值比一九五一年增长百分之五三，其中，工业部增长百分之四十七；其他各部局增长百分之五三；地方国营增长百分之六十五。
    生产资料生产比一九五一年增长百分之五十四
    （内机器制造部门增长百分之六十一），生活资料生产比一九五一年增长百分之四十九。生产资料生产的发展占优先的地位，它的比重在继续增大，一九五二年达工业总产值的百分之六十七·五（一九五一年为百分之六十五·九）。
    在国营经济的领导下，由于国家委托加工任务的增加，私营工业的生产亦有显著的增长，其总产值比上年增长百分之九·四。
    （三）工业生产技术及生产管理的改进
    由于工人阶级的创造性劳动，苏联的先进科学技术的帮助，工业的技术水平有了进一步的提高。首先，机器制造部门试制了几十种新产品。如三千瓩的水力发电机（一九五一年只能制八百瓩），六百瓩的电动机，五千千伏安的变压器，年产六千吨的长网造纸机和几种新式机床。生产的机械化程度亦在提高。如煤矿工业开始采用了割煤机与联合割煤机等设备，钢材生产上出现了反围盘及其他机械自动化。由于改进设备，及生产管理上的先进经验，不仅劳动生产率提高了，更主要的是彻底改善了伪满遗留下来的恶劣的劳动条件。
    黑色冶金方面，由于有效地推行了“全风快料顺行操作法”、“快速炼钢操作法”等先进经验，鞍山钢铁公司平炉每平方公尺炉底面积产钢量比上年度增加百分之二十三，高炉有效面积的利用增加百分之十七。
    电业方面，由于推行了快速检修、统一检修、调整负荷与节约用电等先进方法，大大提高了设备利用率，更合理地使用了电力。设备利用率比上年度提高百分之四十一；调整负荷节约用电一项即节约相当于四万瓩设备的电力。
    煤矿方面，由于合理的调整了劳动组织，实行了周期采煤法，以及大力推广“崔国山快速掘进队的经验”的结果，使煤矿局产煤的全员效率比上年度提高百分之二十五，并继续在克服掘进落后于生产的缺点。
    机械制造方面，推广了高速度切削、多刀多刃切削、“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”和创造了杨守顺铸造法等先进经验，对于机械工业起着重大的改革作用。
    轻工业方面，推广了造纸工业的“快速蒸煮法”、“分部检修法”，使造纸的生产量大大提高。推广制油工业中“李川江制油法”的结果，豆油出油率由百分之十点五提高到百分之十二点五。
    由于先进操作经验的推广，一方面工业生产的原材料消耗定额较一九五一年降低了，因而节省了大量的煤、电、木材和铜等重要燃料和材料；另方面劳动生产率提高了，国营工业劳动生产率提高百分之十四，其中原工业部单位提高百分之二十二，地方国营工业提高百分之十三。由于原材料消耗定额的减少和劳动生产率的提高，全部国营工业生产成本比上年度降低了百分之十二。
    一九五二年的工业生产，在生产管理、产品质量、安全福利等工作上也有了很多的改进，但这种改进较为缓慢，而且是不平衡的。特别是企业的管理水平仍落后于生产发展的要求，很多企业缺乏全面完成国家计划的思想。首先表现在不能均衡地完成国家的生产计划，前松后紧，突击生产的情况普遍存在，不少产品经常完不成本月计划，而需要在下月突击赶任务，有个别的企业，曾连续三个季度未完成计划，第四季就不得不用四分之一的时间去完成全年计划的三分之一的任务。突击生产造成了质量降低、废品增加、事故增多、成本提高的恶果，并影响国家计划的按期完成。
    其次，很多的产品质量不能满足国家建设与人民日益增长的需要。由于不少产品质量低劣，品种不合人民需要，造成若干工业品的积压。有些厂矿竟然违犯国家规定的质量标准，给人民制造不合规格和技术标准的次货。如橡胶制品的质量不合标准，严重地影响了销售及扩大生产；机械产品的质量虽然不断改进，但某些重要部件的废品率仍然很高。
    再次，不少企业未充分注意安全福利工作，因而，生产事故较上年增多。如电业事故次数比上年增加百分之十三点五，且多系重大的责任事故，其中仅重要的设备损毁和重大停电事故达十八次。煤矿方面工人伤亡率比上年增加百分之二十。化学工业中职工中毒和患职业病的亦有增加。纺织工业中大都是通风设备不良，夏季车间温度很高，劳动条件恶劣。这种忽视安全生产和工人生活福利的现象，是不能容忍的。
    各个经济领导部门，尤其是地方国营工业部门，在今后工作中，必须切实有效地克服上述严重的缺点，以进一步提高工业生产水平。
    二、农业生产的发展
    一九五二年全区在农业生产上获得空前的丰收，大大地改善了粮食供应状况和进一步提高了农民的生活水平。全区播种面积完成计划百分之九十九，比上年增加百分之二点一。全区农业总产值完成计划百分之一○一，比上年增长百分之二十二，其中农作物增长百分之二十四，牧畜业增长百分之十三，水产增长百分之五十。主要作物产量：粮食达二千一百万吨，比上年增加四百万吨，内粗粮较上年增加百分之二十五，大豆增加百分之九；皮棉达九万四千吨。
    全区农业互助合作化运动有了进一步的开展。组织起来的农民在农村中已成为多数。国营农场已达五四二处，其中机械化农场有二十九处，有些国营农场在帮助农民改进技术上起了一定的作用。试办的农业生产合作社以及少数集体农庄，在广大农民中起了深刻的良好的影响。集体农庄已成立六处。农业生产合作社发展到一千三百零七个，其产量一般比劳动互助组和个体农民高出很多。常年及三大季互助组达五十二万个，质量较前提高。临时互助组三十七万七千个。
    新技术在农业上的大量采用，推动农民逐步地走向农业互助合作化的道路，而农业互助合作化运动的发展，创造了推广新技术的有利条件。一九五二年全区共推广新农具三万八千台，其中成套推广的马拉农具三千一百七十台，综合号铲?机二万五千台。成立了五十一处以新农具为主的农业技术推广站。推广喷雾器四万台，农药三千五百吨，硫安四万九千吨。农作物施肥面积达一千零七十万垧，比一九五一年（下同）增加了百分之十二；良种普及面积一六八万垧，增加百分之一六八；种子消毒面积
    一三○万垧，增加百分之十。单位面积产量有显著提高，并创造了高额产量的新纪录。高粱每垧最高产量已达一五、○○○斤；大豆已达九、一五○斤；小麦八、○五○斤；水稻二○、○○○斤；棉花八、四一九斤，尤以肇源县推广了“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗、分期追肥”的先进耕作法，创造了近万垧大片农田的丰产经验，值得大力推广。
    由于保护与繁殖牲畜，全区耕畜的总头数比上年增加百分之十一，其中马增加百分之八，牛增加百分之十五。绵羊和羊增加百分之四十九，猪增加百分之十五。
      造林护林工作继续扩展，西部防护林带今年营造十万三千垧，比上年增加四·二倍。全区群众植树达五千二百万株，比上年度增长百分之二十一。
    水利建设，绕阳河治本工程已在进行上游的防沙保土及水库修建的准备工作，并开始进行辽河的大伙房水库工程的技术设计与施工准备工作。全区增加水田四千垧，水田面积已达三十二万垧，由于兴修水利，自然灾害比上年大大地减少了。
    在农业生产上存在着不少的缺点，主要是：在推行农业互助合作运动中，不少地区还没有贯彻党和政府的积极领导、稳步前进的方针，不少干部产生了某些急躁情绪、贪多冒进思想。在生产领导上有些片面性，对先进部分抓得很紧，而忽视对中间与落后部分的领导。
    国营农场工作不能令人满意，农场的领导人员存在着严重的供给制经营思想，不少农场存在着产量低，成本高，浪费大的缺点；机械设备缺乏应有的养护修理工作，效率不能充分发挥，燃料、油料消耗过多；耕种与收割很粗糙，造成损失；某些农场修建不必要的非生产性设施，而不集中精力于生产工作；作业区及轮做制度尚未正式建立，无人负责及紊乱现象相当严重。
    新农具的制造与推广方面，有的质量不合乎标准，某些重要部件质量很坏。对新农具推广不及时，并有积压。对新农具的使用、保管、修配不好，因而，尚不能充分发挥它的效能。
    农业生产合作社的经营管理、产品分配工作，曾经发生过一些偏差，一部分农业生产合作社的公共财产积累过多，贷款过多、摊子铺的很大，公积金、公益金留的过多，影响了社员的收入。会计工作薄弱，帐目混乱，劳动日计算不合理，有的土地、车马与劳动力的分红比例规定不合理，影响农业生产合作社的巩固与发展。上述缺点，虽然都随时作了纠正，但尚待进一步改进。
    在组织西满防护林带的工作中缺点很多：实施计划没有重点；缺乏按地区的严格负责制；林网面积的规定一般化，不适合于不同条件的要求；有的地区植树的成活率很低；管理工作混乱等等。
    各级农业领导机关，在今后工作中，必须充分注意和切实消除这些缺点，以进一步提高农业生产工作的水平。
    三、基本建设的扩大和力量的增长
    一九五二年全区基本建设工作总量完成全年计划百分之九十一，比上年度增加百分之七十二。其中：原东北工业部系统完成计划百分之九十三，比上年度增加百分之一百三十八；其他各部局完成计划百分之八十五，增加百分之十一；各省市完成计划百分之八十四，比上年度增加百分之十九。房屋建筑面积比上年度增加百分之四十。
    几项对我们国家工业化具有重要意义的重大建设工程，如鞍山大型钢材厂、无缝钢管厂、阜新露天矿、阜新发电厂等，均超过了预期的进度，并基本上保证了工程质量。基本建设计划执行的结果，许多新技术设备都参加了生产，使工业、交通运输等部门的生产能力获得了很大的增长。
    东北区基本建设力量的集结与迅速的增长是一九五二年基本建设工作的主要特点。各管理局及其所属企业以及各省市单位都逐步建立与初步健全了基本建设领导机构，使基本建设管理工作逐步统一与加强起来。勘察、设计、建筑、安装的施工力量迅速壮大了。全区基本建设工人已达四十三万人，其中固定工人十二万，比去年增加一·七倍。冬季施工、施工工厂化、机械化、设计标准化、扩大固定技术工人等措施，在增加基本建设力量上均起了很大的作用。
    基本建设工人在爱国增产节约运动中创造与学习了许多先进经验，重要的共有二十一种，其中土木建筑方面三种，机械安装方面十一种，矿井方面三种，地质钻探方面四种。这些经验大大地提高了工作效率，保证了工程质量和降低了成本。如工业部设计公司的“新建筑设计标准”提高了工作效率百分之四十；鞍钢“地脚螺丝安装法”提高工作效率四倍，并保证了技术上的准确性；苏长有砌砖法由一日砌七、八百块提高到一千三、四百块，并保证了质量；王孙慈“分段平行流水作业法”，使三千平方公尺的三层建筑，由原计划一二○天完工，缩短至三十九天完工。
    基本建设是新的复杂的艰巨的工作，一九五二年虽然取得了重要的经验，但缺点仍然不少。基本建设工作准备不充分，材料调拨不及时，一般工程都在六月份才开工，晚动工两个月。
    勘察设计力量仍很薄弱。地质工作人员不足，技术水平很低，工程地质的设备也很不足。已集结的设计力量仍不能满足需要，有些设计质量低劣，甚至设计错误，中途修改，降低了工程质量并提高了工程成本。
    施工管理方面，存在着无人负责现象。有些工地缺乏技术操作规程或有操作规程而未贯彻，影响工程质量；不少工地的劳动组织不合理，常发生窝工现象；基本建设职工的安全福利工作方面还存在着许多不能令人满意的事实。
    基本建设中，经济核算制贯彻很差，某些领导上注意了“好、快”，忽视了“省”；设备材料的管理及财务监督仍不健全，造成很大的浪费。
    各级基本建设领导机关，在今后工作中必须充分注意和切实改进上述缺点，进一步壮大基本建设力量，提高基本建设工作水平，加速国家工业建设的进程。
    四、国营贸易及合作社商品流转的扩大
    随着工农业生产的发展，人民购买力的提高，一九五二年东北区国营贸易及合作社稳步地扩大了商品流转量。国营贸易销售总额完成计划百分之九十七，比一九五一年增长百分之七十六。其中：区内销售完成计划百分之一○三，增长百分之一一九；区外销售完成计划百分之七十，增长百分之二十九。采购总额完成计划百分之一○三，比一九五一年增长百分之五十三。其中：区内采购完成计划百分之一一一，增长百分之七九；区外采购完成计划百分之九四，增长百分之一一○。
    各种主要商品区内销售量完成计划的百分数如下：棉纱一一四；棉布一○七；絮花一五二；粗粮一一三；细粮一三○；猪肉四八六；煤一二四；木材三○○；豆油八二；煤油八三；火柴五九。
    全区合作社销售额完成计划百分之一二八，比一九五一年增加了一六三。合作社特别注意了农民生产资料的供应。农副产品的采购额完成计划百分之一○○，比一九五一年增加百分之一三五。
    一九五二年国营贸易和合作社零售额占社会总零售额百分之六三；批发业务亦有相当发展。国营及合作社贸易在整个社会商品流通中的领导作用更加强了，有力地保证了社会的需要，保持了物价的稳定，全区公私营物价总指数截至十二月底止，为上年同期的百分之一○○·四。
    商品流转工作存在的缺点很多，主要是：对人民需要和市场供应情况缺乏调查研究，采购及调拨工作不准确，不及时，因而有些商品大量积压，又有些商品脱销，不能保证充分供应；经营管理不善，供给制的经营思想还很严重，主要表现为资金周转很慢，费用高，账目乱，责任不清，纪律不严。
    各级商业领导部门，在今后工作中必须坚决地有步骤地消除上述缺点，以进一步改善经营管理，贯彻经济核算制，把商业工作水平提高一步。
    五、交通运输的发展
    随着工业、农业的发展及贸易的扩大，交通运输有了相应的发展。
    铁路运输量（发送吨数）完成计划百分之一○四，比上年增长百分之一六；总装车数完成计划百分之一○一，比上年增长百分之一○，主要货物完成计划的百分数如下：煤一○一，钢铁九七，矿物性建筑材料一一一，木材一○四，粮食一○七。技术定额也提高了，每日装车数完成计划一○一；车辆周转率计划超额完成二·九九天，比上年提高百分之八·三；全路开展的满载、超轴、五百公里运动，提高了运输效率，改进了管理工作。
    内河货运总量完成计划百分之一○七，比上年提高百分之二二。公路运输完成计划百分之一○九，比上年提高百分之八二。
    邮政业务量完成计划百分之八三，其中电报完成计划百分之八五，电话完成计划百分之八二。邮电计划存在着不切合实际的缺点；邮电工作在扩充业务上曾发生过严重的强制摊派、脱离群众的偏向，今后必须坚决纠正。
    六、文化及市政建设的发展
    东北教育事业有了进一步的发展。学生总数达六七八万人，比上年增加百分之二三。其中：大专学生达三万八千人，增加百分之三九；中学生达四十八万人，增加百分之八四；内技术学校学生六万六千人，增加一·三倍；小学生达六二六万人，增加百分之一九。
    全区书籍出版一亿一千五百万册，比上年增加百分之一八。报纸发行三亿零五百万份，增加百分之六二，其中东北日报发行已达九千万份。全区发行电影片三六○部。电影观众七千六百万人次，比上年增加百分之三三。
      一九五二年全区的卫生事业也有很大发展。为了反对美帝国主义进行的细菌战，全区开展了群众性的大规模的爱国卫生运动，取得了很大胜利。卫生保健机构达四千二百个，病床增加五千张，共达二万七千张床位。防疫注射普遍施行，注射群众达三、二九五万人，大大缩小了传染病的危害力。全区体育运动有了显著的开展，人民的体质逐步在增强。
      城市公共事业在贯彻面向工人阶级，为生产服务的方针下，在改建道路、扩充市内汽车和电车业务、改建自来水和地下水道、在挖掘河渠、植树、扩充公园和改善瓦斯热力供应等工作方面，都做了许多工作，并开始了工业城市的整体规划工作。
    在文化、教育、卫生等工作方面，存在着重视数量增长忽视质量的缺点；医疗卫生人员仍不敷需要，今后应在教学效果及医疗保健组织工作方面力求改进与加强。
    七、人民物质生活的提高
    随着工农业生产的不断增长，劳动人民的物质生活，亦逐步地得到改善与提高。
    一九五二年全区职工人数比上年增加了三十五万。职工基本工资比上年提高了百分之九（不包括房租水电费百分之二○），由于普遍推行计件工资制度，许多职工获得了超额奖励。此外，国家按工资基金总额比例支付的文化福利事业的附加工资，比上年也有显著增加。全区为职工新建宿舍一六九万平方公尺，比上年增加百分之八二。
    农民生活也继续提高了。一九五二年农民粮食收入比上年增加了四百万吨。由于合理地提高粮价与降低工业品价格的结果，使农民获得很大的利益。
    由于城乡人民生活的改善，国营贸易区内销货量比上年有了显著增加：棉布增加百分之四十一；胶鞋增加一·七倍；香皂增加一倍，肥皂增加一·三倍；砂糖增加百分之五十三；毛巾增加百分之五二；袜子增加一·一倍。城乡劳动人民对商品质量及商品品种不断增长着新的要求。
    东北区一九五二年国民经济计划的超额完成，进一步壮大了我们祖国的经济力量与国防力量。在生产增长的基础上，工农劳动人民的生活水平得到了改善与提高。一九五二年工农业生产已恢复并超过历史最高年（一九四三年）的水平。工农业生产超过一九四三年百分之三十二。其中：工业生产超过百分之二十三；农业生产超过百分之四十七。自一九四九年以来的四年中，东北人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，医治了战争时期国民经济所遭受的创伤，结束了经济恢复时期的工作，并开始有重点地、有步骤地进行大规模的经济建设。这一事实充分证明了新民主主义社会制度与经济制度的优越性和它的无限活力。东北人民现正满怀信心地迎接国家建设的第一个五年计划的第一个年度计划！
