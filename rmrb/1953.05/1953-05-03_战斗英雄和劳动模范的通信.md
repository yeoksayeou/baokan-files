Correspondence between Combat Heroes and Model Workers
Letter from Combat Heroes
To all the model worker comrades studying at the Experimental Worker-Peasant Middle School:

The great May 1st International Labor Day is coming soon. I hope you are making great progress in your studies at school! We are all well too. Since the army began cultural studies last June, the Party has transferred us to cultural schools for specialized learning. Although it has been less than a year, we are very different from the past. I remember at the National Congress of Combat Heroes in 1950, Comrade Yang Shinan could not even write his name. When asked to sign, he could only draw a circle. The rest of us, although able to write our names, could not even write a coherent letter. Now, the vast majority of us have reached the level of upper primary school in language, arithmetic, and science. Some are about to graduate. Every comrade can now read some popular books and write short articles. What is particularly worth telling you is that we can now read the works of our great leader Chairman Mao. For example, Comrade Ma Chunyu has already read half of the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. How much this helps to improve our political theory and master modern military technology! And this is precisely the purpose of our cultural learning. We have made some contributions to the people in the past, and we will certainly maintain our glory, carry forward our glory, and always remember the valuable instructions given to us by Chairman Mao at the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Model Workers. We will play a bridging role, a backbone role, and a leading role in various work posts, and advance side by side with you!

You have made great contributions to the cause of economic construction in the past. We believe that under the cultivation and education of the Party, you will be able to quickly improve your cultural and political levels. In the future, when you return to your work posts, you will be able to further develop your creative spirit and better build our great and lovable motherland. We hope you will often write to us and constantly introduce your learning experiences, so that we can help each other and make progress together.

Reply from Model Workers
Dear Comrades Ma Chunyu, Xue Chengrang, Sang Jinqiu, Yang Shinan, Chang Enju, and Cui Zhishan:

Your letter has been received. We really don't know how to thank you for your enthusiastic concern.

Dear comrades! We often receive letters from all over the motherland. Their letters are a great encouragement to us, but today, receiving your letter, we were moved to tears. Two years ago, you could not even write your own names well, and some of you could not write at all. But today, you can not only write letters and read newspapers, but also write articles and read the works of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong.

Dear comrades! We were also mostly uneducated people in the past. People said, "We don't know half a sheng of characters," and that was indeed the case. But today, the Party has cultivated us into people with cultural and scientific knowledge. We entered the Northeast Experimental Worker-Peasant Middle School at the end of 1951. At that time, we could not read newspapers, could not write letters, and could only add and subtract in arithmetic, not even multiply or divide very well. But now, after only a little over a year of study, we can not only read books and newspapers, but also write articles for newspapers. We have also learned integers and decimals in arithmetic, all the way to geometry and algebra. In addition, we have also learned world geography and the long and glorious history of our motherland. This has made us further realize the greatness and lovableness of our motherland.

Dear comrades! The great May 1st Labor Day is coming soon, and we are all welcoming it with the most joyful mood. This year's celebration of May 1st is different from previous years, because this is the first May 1st since the motherland began large-scale economic construction. Although we cannot directly participate in the economic construction of the motherland now, we know that our current studies are also for the purpose of better building the motherland in the future. Therefore, our thoughts are always closely linked with the country's economic construction.

Dear comrades! Let us encourage each other to better complete the learning tasks assigned to us by the people of the motherland!

    战斗英雄和劳动模范的通信
    战斗英雄的来信在实验工农中学学习的各位劳动模范同志们：
    伟大的“五一”国际劳动节就要来到了，想你们在学校学习一定有很大成绩吧！我们也都很好。自从去年六月部队开始文化学习以来，党就把我们调到文化学校来专门学习了，时间虽然还不到一年，可是我们已经和过去大不相同了。记得在一九五○年全国战斗英雄代表会议上，杨世南同志还不会写名字，别人叫签名，他只能画一个圈。其余几个人，虽然能够写名字，可是连封信也写不通顺。现在，我们绝大多数同志已在语文、算术、自然等方面达到了高小程度，有的已经快要毕业了，每个同志都已经能够看一些通俗读物，并能够写一些简短的文章。特别值得告诉你们的，是我们现在已经能够看伟大的领袖毛主席的著作了，像马春雨同志就已经把毛泽东选集第一卷看了半本了。这对提高我们的政治理论水平和掌握现代化军事技术该有多大帮助啊！而这正是我们学习文化的目的。我们过去曾经为人民立了一点功绩，今后我们也一定能够保持光荣，发扬光荣，永远地牢记着毛主席在全国战斗英雄、劳动模范代表会议上给我们的宝贵指示，在各种工作岗位上发挥桥梁作用、骨干作用与带头作用，和你们并肩前进！
    你们在过去对于祖国的经济建设事业已经做了很大的贡献，我们相信你们在党的培养教育下，一定能够很快地提高自己的文化水平与政治水平，将来回到工作岗位上，会更多地发挥你们的创造精神，更好地建设我们伟大而可爱的祖国。希望你们常常给我们来信，不断地介绍你们的学习经验，以便互相帮助，共同进步。

      劳动模范的复信亲爱的马春雨、薛成让、桑金秋、杨世南、常恩举、崔志山同志：
    你们的来信收到了。我们真不知怎样感谢你们的热情的关切。
    亲爱的同志们！我们常常接到祖国各地的来信。他们的信对我们鼓励很大，但是今天接到你们的来信，却使我们感动得流下泪来。两年前，你们连自己的名字都写不好，有的根本就不会写，但是今天不仅能写信、看报，而且还能够写文章，能够读我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志的著作了。
    亲爱的同志！我们过去也都是一些大老粗，人们都说“我们斗大的字不识半升”，的确就是这样。可是今天党却把我们培养成具有文化科学知识的人了。我们是一九五一年末进东北实验工农中学的，当时不能看报，不会写信，算术也只能加减，连乘除都不大会。可是到现在仅仅学了一年多的时间，不但能够看书看报，而且可以给报纸写稿子了。算术也学了整数、小数，一直到几何、代数。此外，我们还学了世界地理，和祖国悠久光辉的历史。这使我们进一步认识了祖国的伟大和可爱。
    亲爱的同志！伟大的“五一”劳动节即将到来，我们都怀着最喜悦的心情来迎接它。今年纪念“五一”和往年更有所不同，因为这是祖国开始大规模经济建设的第一个“五一”，现在我们虽然不能直接参加祖国的经济建设，但是我们知道：我们现在的学习也是为了将来更好地建设祖国。所以我们的思想始终是和国家的经济建设紧紧连在一起的。
    亲爱的同志们！让我们互相勉励：更好地完成祖国人民交给我们的学习任务吧！
