Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 22nd. The “Democratic Korea” newspaper published an editorial on the 22nd, resolutely demanding that the U.S. abandon its attitude of delaying and obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations.

The editorial pointed out: In order to strive for the realization of the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese side put forward a fair and reasonable new proposal on May 7th. However, the U.S. side refused to accept this proposal, and continued to raise some administrative detail issues to delay the negotiations, and on the 13th put forward an absurd "counter-proposal." When this "counter-proposal" was met with our firm opposition, the U.S. side actually adjourned the negotiations for three days, followed by another five days. The U.S. State Department, in order to conceal its policy of obstructing the armistice negotiations, also issued a statement completely distorting the facts. This shows that the intention of the U.S. side is to not reach an agreement quickly at all.

The editorial emphasized: In the negotiations, the U.S. side needs to respond to our sincerity with sincerity. The negotiations should absolutely no longer be delayed, and the conditions for realizing the Korean armistice have matured. Therefore, when the negotiations resume on the 25th, the U.S. side should answer the expectations of the people of the world who demand that the U.S. no longer obstruct the realization of the armistice with sincerity, withdraw its unreasonable "counter-proposal," and accept our reasonable proposal.

    “民主朝鲜”报发表社论
    坚决要求美方放弃阻挠停战谈判的态度
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】“民主朝鲜”报二十二日发表社论，坚决要求美方放弃拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的态度。
    社论指出：朝中方面为了争取朝鲜停战的实现，曾在五月七日提出了公平合理的新方案。但是美方不肯接受这个方案，不断提出一些有关行政性的细则问题来拖延谈判，并在十三日提出了荒谬的“反建议”。而当这个“反建议”受到我方坚决反对以后，美方竟使谈判休会了三天，接着又休会了五天。美国国务院为了掩饰他们阻碍停战谈判的政策，并发表了一个完全歪曲事实的声明。这表明美方的意图是根本不要迅速达成协议。
    社论强调说：在谈判中，需要美方以诚意来答复我方的诚意。谈判完全不应该再被拖延，实现朝鲜停战的条件已经成熟了。因此，美方在二十五日谈判复会时，应以诚意来回答全世界人民要求美方不再阻挠停战实现的期望，收回它毫无道理的“反建议”，接受我方的合理方案。
