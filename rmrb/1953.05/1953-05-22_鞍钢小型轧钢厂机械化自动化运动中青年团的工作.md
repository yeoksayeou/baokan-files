The work of the Youth League in the Mechanization and Automation Movement of the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill
Li Shaotang

	When the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement began in May 1952, the Party Committee of the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill convened a meeting (including personnel from the administrative, trade union, and Youth League aspects) to study methods and steps for completing the national production plan and the increase production and practice economy plan. At that time, everyone unanimously believed: "The plan is advanced; the equipment is backward." Based on this situation, the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League determined the guiding principle and put forward the three major slogans: "Mechanization and automation, product standardization, and operation rationalization." At the same time, the Party put forward three requirements for the Youth League: (1) Assist the Party in doing a good job in political and ideological education; (2) Launch a "Do One Thing Well" movement among Youth League members and young people; (3) Assist the Party in creating automation, learning automation, and mastering automation. The Youth League Committee grasped these key points and carried out work according to the nature and characteristics of the Youth League's work. In the entire mechanization and automation movement, the Youth League organization did the following main tasks:

	I. Leading cadres go deep into workshops, do a good job in ideological assessment and cadre training, and give full play to organizational roles

	(1) Assist the Party committee in conducting ideological investigations and grasping the ideological situation. An advanced production plan was affirmed, and the slogan of mechanization and automation was put forward throughout the factory. However, at the beginning, this slogan had not yet formed a practical action for the masses, and it had not yet aroused enough attention from the masses. The Party committee grasped the overall situation and decided to solve the ideological problem first. Therefore, in addition to participating in the ideological investigation work carried out by the Party, the Youth League also specifically investigated the situation of Youth League members and young people. The survey found that the average worker's understanding of mechanization and automation was vague, while young workers still had great concerns. The ideological situation of young people was: (a) believing that they had short seniority and low technical level and could not create; (b) believing that invention and creation were matters for veteran workers and technicians and had nothing to do with themselves; (c) individual comrades were afraid of conducting research and creation work, which would affect their cultural and technical learning.

	(2) Cultivate typical examples and train cadres. After the Youth League Committee grasped the overall ideological situation based on various investigations, it decided to focus on the key process in production—rolling—as the key point of the work, assist the Party committee in cultivating typical examples, establishing banners, and using the work method of using a point to lead the area to promote the work of other shifts or individuals. At that time, the Youth League Committee did this: It trained the youth backbone in the workshop to make the grass-roots cadres clearly grasp the main links of "mechanization and automation, product standardization, and operation rationalization." The Youth League Committee also concentrated its efforts to cultivate the Jia shift Youth League members Zhang Qingyin, Zhu Chengrong, and Liang Wensheng group, conducted political and ideological education, and focused on explaining that the potential capacity of mechanical application in the factory was very large. In the beginning, they started by discussing the plan, carefully calculated based on the equipment utilization and the coordination between the various processes, and formulated an advanced production plan; based on improving the labor organization, they implemented labor division specialization and created the advanced "three-color indicator chart" production management method, continuously creating new rolling records.

	Then it mobilized the Yi shift youth advanced group led by Jiang Xingjia to take the lead in learning from the experience of the early shift, so that this advanced experience could be consolidated and developed. As a result, the rolling capacity of the Yi shift increased by 150% compared to the Jia shift. The Youth League organization tightly grasped this fact and educated all Youth League members and young people. The administrative aspect and the Youth League respectively rewarded the Jiang Xingjia group, and selected Jiang Xingjia to represent his group to attend the Anshan City Fourth Labor Model Representative Conference, and awarded Jiang Xingjia the honorary title of Model Group.

	(3) Consolidate typical examples. Jiang Xingjia's participation in the Labor Model Representative Conference greatly stimulated other shifts, some workers expressed dissatisfaction, and individual workers attacked Jiang Xingjia. Zhang Zhenshan of Bing shift said to Gao Shiyi, a member of the Jiang Xingjia group: "Friend! Why do you have to do that! Why not stop for a while and let us catch up!" But Gao Shiyi not only did not listen to him, but also explained some principles to him and criticized him, finally getting through his thoughts.

	After the Youth League Committee grasped these situations, it reported to the Party committee, and the Party committee instructed the Youth League to further strengthen the leadership of the Jiang Xingjia group so that their work could be gradually improved on the current basis. The administrative and trade union aspects all strongly supported this work, and the factory director personally helped the Jiang Xingjia group find the key to creating the "one, three, five hole simultaneous entry" rapid rolling method, which was promoted to other shifts, which enriched the content of the "Do One Thing Well" movement called for by the Youth League.

	II. Fostering the buds of creativity of young workers and enabling them to blossom and bear fruit

	(1) Mobilize young workers to learn from veteran workers with creative talents. In September of last year, the successful creation of the "anti-encircling disc" by veteran worker Zhang Mingshan greatly encouraged the creative enthusiasm of all employees in the factory. The Youth League Committee mobilized all Youth League members and young people to learn from Zhang Mingshan's spirit of creativity, which is not afraid of difficulties and painstakingly studies. With the development of the mass automation movement throughout the factory, Youth League members and young people, around the "Do One Thing Well" movement, put forward more than 160 suggestions with key importance.

	(2) Vigorously support the suggestions of young workers. Generally speaking, young workers do not have much work experience, but they are good at accepting new things and have a higher cultural level. The experience of small factories proves that as long as young workers eliminate concerns and receive support from the leadership, they can use their brains, use their minds, and think of ways in their work, and they can also have new creations. For example, Chen Baosheng, a Youth League member in the heating section, raised the issue of the wind cap inside the furnace when studying low-pressure air supply, which solved the problem of black slag that had not been resolved for three years. However, when Chen Baosheng was studying, he was also attacked by backward workers. Some workers said, "If it's good, it's rationalization, if it's bad, the country will suffer." Some wrote on the blackboard: "Chen Baosheng violated labor discipline (referring to him coming early and leaving late for research)." Others said: "He's only been working for two years and he wants to create, purely wanting to show off and looking down on the old masters..." After Chen Baosheng suffered these blows, he was somewhat discouraged and unwilling to continue his research. When the Youth League organization discovered this situation, it discussed with the Party committee, administration, and trade union, and asked them to support him in all aspects, and talked to Chen Baosheng to encourage him. In addition to solving ideological problems, the Youth League organization also focused on helping him solve problems at work. He said with emotion: "The organization's support for me has strengthened my courage to overcome difficulties." As a result, he finally succeeded in creating.

	(3) Summarize the deeds of advanced figures and introduce advanced ideas to the masses. In this way, advanced figures such as Jiang Xingjia and Chen Baosheng became role models in the minds of the young people in the factory. The Youth League Committee, based on their historical situation, ideological development process, motivation for creating advanced experience, and spirit of painstaking research to overcome difficulties, etc., after induction and research, initially summarized their advanced ideas, and collected feedback on them from the masses to help them overcome shortcomings and establish prestige. Then it convened a Youth League members' meeting, and widely absorbed young people to participate, and invited advanced figures to make reports at the meeting. Facts have proved that this typical demonstration education effect is very large. For example, Han Lide, a Youth League member of the heating furnace shift, expressed his attitude on the spot, saying: "After listening to the reports of Jiang Xingjia and Chen Baosheng, I thought: I am also a Youth League member, why can't I create? There is only one conclusion: it is because my thinking is not as progressive as theirs. In the future, I will definitely study in my work and actively create!" Later, he took the initiative to unite the surrounding masses and used holidays to study the heating furnace's "three non-impacts" (no waiting, no interruption, no cooling); Xie Youku, a Youth League member of the shearing shift, eliminated "re-shearing" in the shearing work and created a rapid shearing method, which solved the contradiction that the shearing process could not supply the needs of production. The young worker Jiang Youcai could not find the trick himself, so he felt very sad that he could not complete the "Do One Thing Well" task. Later, he made up his mind to ask the veteran worker Zuo Lianshun to help him solve the trick of generating gas. This trick was finally found, and he was also praised and rewarded.

	III. The Youth League and the Party, administration, and trade union work in the same pace to ensure the smooth progress of the mechanization and automation movement

	In the entire mechanization and automation movement, the work of the Youth League has become an organic part of the factory's work. According to the different development situations of the movement and the different nature of the work, it has organized and planned to mobilize all Youth League members and young people to complete the Party's tasks. The ideological pace of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League leadership is completely consistent, and there has never been a phenomenon of conflict or incompatibility between the various departments. For example: There are more suggestions, especially suggestions for improving equipment, but the subjective strength of the repair workshop cannot meet the needs of the work. Therefore, many mechanical modification plans cannot be completed on schedule, which delays the early realization of automation. If this problem is not resolved, it will inevitably affect the creative enthusiasm of the masses. For this reason, the trade union organized the Liang Shiqing group to learn from the experience of the multi-technology joint group in the steelmaking plant, and did the same after returning. However, because the group lacked backbone (few Party and Youth League members) and lacked political and ideological education, it soon collapsed. According to this situation, the Youth League branch of the repair workshop took the initiative to discuss with the trade union and selected three outstanding Youth League members to participate in the Liang Shiqing group to play a leading role, and finally made this multi-technology joint group a success.

	When manufacturing the "anti-encircling disc" invented by Zhang Mingshan, because it was urgent to test at that time and the task was urgent, under their efforts, the four-day task was completed in three and a half days. Gao Shixin, a Youth League member of the fitter shift, saw that other shifts were engaged in automation and advanced experience, so he took the initiative to sign up to help Han Changxin manufacture the steel-turning machine, and worked continuously for seven days without going home to rest. Qi Baoyu, the foreman of the fitter shift, was unwilling to help make the automatic feeding machine for the heating furnace, and the apprentice Zhang Jinghua persuaded him and got through his thoughts. As a result, the completion of the manufacturing tasks was guaranteed on schedule, and the experiment was never delayed due to the untimely manufacturing.

	IV. Mobilize outstanding Youth League members and young people to master the operating technology of mechanization and automation

	After mechanization is automated, mastering automation is still a very meticulous and complicated task. For example, the automatic feeding machine of the heating furnace is completely operated by electricity. From loading to extraction, it can all be automatically operated by pressing a button. This work is not something that everyone can do. This requires transferring advanced figures who are ideologically progressive, work actively, and are good at accepting new things to master. This work has long been decided by the Party: to be responsible for the Youth League. The Youth League organization selected three Youth League members, Lu Weizhong and others, to learn and master this operating technology. They all believed that this was the most glorious work task assigned to them by the Party, and they patiently studied and mastered the operating technology in a very short period of time, ensuring safe production. In addition, deputy adjusters of rolling mills were cultivated in a planned way to master the adjustment of "anti-encircling disc" and "electrical guide plate."

	The work of the Youth League in small factories, as proved by the organizations of other factories and mines, especially the No. 53 factory Youth League: The Youth League plays the role of the Party's assistant in enterprise management, which is one of the important conditions for them to achieve brilliant achievements. Just as Comrade Gao Gang pointed out at the Third Congress of the Northeast Youth League: "...The Youth League organization plays the role of the Party's assistant. The tasks of each period and the guidelines and policies of various work are all stipulated by the Party. The task of the Youth League is to rely on its own organization to publicize these decisions of the Party among the young masses, and under the leadership of the Party, together with other organizations, actively act to realize these decisions of the Party." As pointed out in the resolution on the current work of the Third Congress of the Northeast Youth League: "...Youth League organizations at all levels in the Northeast must, under the close leadership of Party committees at all levels, actively and diligently study various policies, strive to overcome pride and complacency, work diligently and conscientiously, and earnestly summarize and learn from the advanced experience of the masses in production, technology, and work and study activities."

	At present, the Youth League organization of the small rolling mill is continuing to follow the instructions of the Party, further unite the broad masses of young people, in order to strive to complete the task of automation of the whole factory as soon as possible.

    鞍钢小型轧钢厂机械化自动化运动中青年团的工作
    李绍唐
    一九五二年五月增产节约运动开始时，鞍钢小型轧钢厂党委会召开了会议（包括行政、工会、青年团方面的人员），研究完成国家生产计划和增产节约计划的方法及步骤。当时大家一致认为：“计划是先进的；设备是落后的。”根据这种情况，党、行政、工会和青年团确定了方针，提出：“机械自动化，产品标准化，操作合理化”的三大口号。同时党对青年团提出三项要求：（一）协助党做好政治思想教育工作；（二）发动团员和青年“做好一件事”运动；（三）协助党作好创造自动化、学习自动化、掌握自动化的工作。青年团团委掌握了这些重点，并根据团的工作性质、特点进行工作。在整个机械化自动化运动中，青年团的组织作了以下几项主要工作：
    一、领导干部深入车间，做好思想摸底和干部
    训练工作，充分发挥组织作用
    （一）协助党委进行思想调查，掌握思想情况。先进的生产计划肯定下来了，全厂提出了机械化自动化的口号。但是在开始时，这一口号还没有形成群众的实际行动，还没有引起群众足够的重视。党委掌握了全面情况，决定首先要解决思想问题。于是，青年团除了参加党所进行的思想调查工作外，还专门调查了团员和青年的情况。在调查中发现，一般工人对机械化自动化的认识是模糊的，青年工人则还有很大顾虑。青年们的思想情况是：（甲）认为自己工龄短，技术水平低，不能创造；（乙）认为发明创造是老工人和技术人员的事，和自己没啥关系；（丙）个别同志怕进行研究创造的工作，影响了自己的文化和技术学习。
    （二）培养典型，训练干部。青年团团委根据各方面的调查，掌握了全面思想情况以后，就决定以生产中的关键的工序——压延，作为工作的重点，协助党委培养典型，树立旗帜，用以点带面的工作方法，推动其他班组或个人的工作。当时团委是这样做的：对车间青年骨干进行训练工作，使基层干部明确地抓住“机械自动化，产品标准化，操作合理化”的主要环节。团委并集中力量，培养生产较好的甲班团员张庆印、朱成荣、梁文生小组，进行政治思想教育，并着重说明该厂机械运用的潜在能力是非常大的。开始，他们先从讨论计划着手，根据设备运用情况和各工序间的配合，精打细算，订出了先进的生产计划；以改善劳动组织为基础，实行劳动分工专业化，创造了先进的“三色指示图表”生产管理法，连续创造轧钢新纪录。
    接着就动员乙班青年先进小组姜兴家组带头学习早班经验，使这一先进经验能够巩固和发展。结果，乙班轧钢能力又比甲班提高了百分之一百五十。青年团组织紧紧抓住了这一事实，向全体团员和青年进行教育。行政方面和青年团分别奖励了姜兴家小组，选姜兴家代表他的小组出席了鞍山市第四届劳动模范代表会议，并授予姜兴家模范小组光荣称号。
    （三）巩固典型。姜兴家的参加劳动模范代表会，给其他班组的刺激很大，有的工人表现不服气，个别工人则打击姜兴家。丙班张振山对姜兴家小组组员高世一说：“朋友！你何必那样干呢！不如停一停，叫我们赶上就得啦呗！”但是高世一不但没有听他的话，反而对他讲了一番道理，批评了他，终于打通了他的思想。
    青年团团委掌握了这些情况以后，就向党委汇报，党委指示青年团要进一步加强对姜兴家小组的领导，使他们的工作在现在基础上逐步提高。行政、工会方面对这一工作都大力支持，厂长并亲自帮助姜兴家小组找窍门，创造了“一三五孔同入”快速轧钢法，推广到其他班里，这就丰富了团所号召的“做好一件事”运动的内容。
    二、把青年工人创造的萌芽扶植起来，使它开
    花结果
    （一）动员青年工人向具有创造才能的老工人学习。在去年九月间，老工人张明山的“反围盘”创造成功了，这就大大地鼓舞了全厂职工的创造热情。青年团团委动员全体团员和青年向张明山那种不怕困难、艰苦钻研的创造精神学习。随着全厂范围的群众性自动化运动的开展，团员和青年就围绕着“做好一件事”运动，提出了带有关键性的建议
    一百六十余件。
    （二）大力支持青年工人建议。青年工人一般来说，工作经验是不多的，但是他们善于接受新鲜事物，文化水平较高。小型厂的经验证明：青年工人只要打消顾虑，得到领导方面的支持，能在工作中动脑筋、用心思、想办法，同样是可以有新的创造的。例如加热工段的青年团员陈宝胜提出了研究低压送风时炉内发生风帽子的问题，把三年来未能解决的出黑渣问题解决了。但是，在陈宝胜研究时，同样遭到落后工人的打击。有的工人说：“好了是合理化，坏了国家遭殃”，有的在黑板上写道：“陈宝胜违犯劳动纪律（指他为了研究而早来晚走）”，也有人说：“就凭他二年工龄还要创造，纯粹是想出风头，看不起老师傅……。”陈宝胜遭到了这些打击后，有些灰心了，不愿意再研究下去。团的组织发觉这种情况，就和党委、行政、工会研究，请他们从各方面支持，并找陈宝胜谈话，进行鼓励。团的组织并动员其他团员帮助他研究，除了解决思想问题外，也着重帮助他解决工作上的问题。他感动地说：“组织这样支持我，就加强了我克服困难的勇气。”结果他终于创造成功了。
    （三）总结先进人物的事迹，向群众介绍先进思想。这样一来，姜兴家、陈宝胜等先进人物就成为全厂青年们心目中的榜样。青年团团委根据他们的历史情况，思想发展过程，创造先进经验的动机，钻心研究克服困难的精神等材料，经过归纳研究，初步总结出他们的先进思想，并在群众中收集对他们的反映，帮助他们克服缺点，树立威信。然后召集团员大会，并广泛吸收青年群众参加，请先进人物在大会上作报告。事实证明：这种典型示范的教育作用是很大的，如加热炉班团员韩立德当场表示态度说：“我听了姜兴家和陈宝胜的报告后，就想：我也是个团员，为什么就不能创造呢？这只有一个结论：就是因为我的思想不如他们进步，今后我一定在工作中钻研，积极创造！”以后他就主动团结周围群众，利用假日到公园研究加热炉“三不影响”（不等、不断、不凉）；剪断班团员谢有库在剪断工作中消灭了“回剪”，创造了快速剪断法，解决了剪断工序供不上生产需要的矛盾。青年工人蒋有财自己没有找到窍门，就认为自己完不成“做好一件事”任务，心里非常难过。他后来下了决心，请老工人左连顺帮助他解决发生煤气的窍门。这一窍门终于找到了，他也受到了表扬和奖励。
    三、青年团和党、行政、工会的工作步调一
    致，保证机械化自动化运动的顺利进行
    在整个机械化自动化运动中，团的工作成了全厂工作的一个有机的组成部分，根据运动不同的发展情况和不同的工作性质，有组织有计划地发动全体团员和青年完成党的任务。党、行政、工会和青年团领导方面思想步调完全一致，从未发生各部相抵触和不合“拍”的现象。例如：建议增多，特别是改进设备的建议增多，而补修车间的主观力量却不能满足工作的需要。因此，很多机械改造计划不能按期完成，延误了自动化的早日实现。这个问题如得不到解决，势必影响群众的创造情绪。工会为此，组织梁世清小组去炼钢厂学习多种技术联合小组的经验，回来后就照着做。但因组内缺少骨干（党、团员少），政治思想教育不够，不久就垮台了。补修车间的青年团支部根据这种情况，就主动和工会研究，挑选了三名优秀团员参加梁世清小组，起带头骨干作用，终于使这个多种技术联合小组获得了成功。
    在制造张明山所发明的“反围盘”时，因当时急于试验，任务紧迫，在他们的努力下，四天任务三天半就完成了。钳工班团员高世信看到别的班里都搞自动化和先进经验，他就主动报名帮助韩长信制造翻钢机，曾七天不回家休息，连续工作。钳工班长祁宝余不愿帮助制作加热炉自动推料机，徒工张景华就说服他，打通他的思想。结果都保证了制造任务的按期完成，从来没有因为制造不及时而耽误试验。
    四、动员优秀团员和青年掌握机械化自动化的
    操作技术
    机械自动化了，掌握自动化仍是一件很细致很复杂的工作。例如加热炉的自动推料机，完全用电气操纵，从装料到抽出，只要一按电钮就可全部自动操作了。这项工作不是任何人都能够胜任的，这就需要抽调思想进步的，工作积极的，善于接受新事物的先进人物来掌握。这项工作是早就被党所决定了的：要青年团来负责任。青年团的组织挑选了吕维忠等三个团员去学习和掌握这项操作技术。他们都认为这是党交给他们的最光荣的工作任务，耐心钻研，在很短期间就掌握了操作技术，保证了安全生产。另外并有计划地培养了轧钢机的副调整工人，以使掌握“反围盘”与“电气导板”的调整。
    小型厂青年团的工作，如像其他厂矿特别是五三工厂青年团的组织所证明了的：青年团在企业管理上发挥党的助手作用，是他们获得辉煌成就的重要条件之一。正像在东北团委第三次会议上高岗同志所指出的：“……青年团的组织，所起的是党的助手作用，每个时期的任务和各种工作的方针与政策，都是党所规定了的，青年团的任务就是依靠自己的组织，在青年群众中宣传党的这些决定，并在党的领导下与其他组织一道，为实现党的这些决定而积极活动。”东北团委第三次会议关于当前工作的决议中所指出的：“……东北各级团的组织，必须在各级党委的密切领导下，积极努力学习各种政策，力戒骄傲自满，兢兢业业，埋头深入工作，认真总结与学习群众中生产的、技术的以及工作和学习等活动的先进经验”。
    目前小型轧钢厂青年团的组织，正在继续遵循着党的指示，进一步地团结广大青年群众，以争取早日完成全厂自动化的任务。
