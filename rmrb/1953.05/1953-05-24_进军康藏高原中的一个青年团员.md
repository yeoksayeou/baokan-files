A Young League Member Advancing into the Kangzang Plateau
　　Shu Fan

　　Summer of 1950. On Erlang Mountain in the Kangzang Plateau. In order to ensure the smooth passage of the westward-bound army, the road construction troops were rushing to build bridges. Just as a large bridge was about to be completed, it was short two bridge girders. So the leadership immediately sent more than ten soldiers to cut timber again. To their delight, in less than half a day, they finally felled a large tree, about ten zhang long and two spans thick, more than enough for two bridge girders. As the timber rolled down the hillside, the timber cutters cheered with excitement. Suddenly, there was a "crack" sound, and the timber stopped rolling, blocked by a boulder protruding from the mountainside. If they were to cut another timber, it would take at least half a day, and it might not meet the standards required for the bridge. If they were to dig away the boulder, the stone and the timber would rush straight down, and the person digging the stone might be in mortal danger. Just as everyone was looking at each other, unsure of what to do, suddenly someone stepped forward and said with passion: "The whole company is waiting for this timber to build the bridge, and many troops are waiting for this bridge to pass. It's up to us. I'll go and dig away the stone!" This person was Yang Maowu, who at the age of eighteen three years ago was called a "little hero." This person was Yang Maowu, who wrote in his determination letter before advancing into Kangzang: "No matter how high the mountain or how thick the snow, I will overcome difficulties, complete the task, and strive to be a Youth League member."

　　At this time, the comrades did not agree to him taking the risk and suggested another plan. But Yang Maowu was determined to go. He thought of his squad leader, the Communist Party member Guo Lijiang. He thought, "Doesn't the squad leader often advise everyone to take care of their bodies, because we still have to build a communist society and live a communist life! But in the bandit suppression, he braved the rain of bullets to attack the enemy's machine gun position. Didn't the squad leader know the danger! No, the task required him to do so. Now the task of building the bridge also requires me to do so. I should be like the squad leader, unafraid of all dangers!" So he dug footholds in the soil and walked along the steep slope towards the boulder. When he reached the stone, he first dug a shallow ditch along the front of the stone. At this time, the resistance of the soil on both sides of the stone could still support the weight of the timber. Then he stood on both sides of the stone and dug hard. The stone gradually loosened. Yang Maowu hurriedly dodged to one side. At this time, the boulder, carrying the timber, rushed down violently, sand and gravel splashing everywhere, and the sound was like a landslide. Yang Maowu was shaken and could hardly stand, almost rolling down the mountain. When his comrades ran to rescue him, he had already climbed up from the ground, wiped the blood flowing down his ear, and walked up the hillside as if nothing had happened.

　　Summer on Erlang Mountain is the season of continuous rain. Due to the urgency of the task, the troops worked in the rain, and everyone's cotton clothes were soaked through. The comrades worked hard all day, and at night they were exhausted. No one went to dry their clothes, and the next day they started working in wet clothes again. Yang Maowu thought, "If the comrades work in wet clothes every day, won't they get sick after a long time? The task is already tight, and if everyone gets sick, who will complete it?" At this time, he thought of his squad leader Guo Lijiang again. "If the squad leader were here, what would he do? The squad leader would definitely sacrifice his sleep and dry everyone's clothes. Now that the squad leader is not here, I should do this." So he got up from the ground and carried all the comrades' cotton clothes outside the tent. The rain had stopped, and the white snow on the distant mountain peaks sparkled in the black night sky. Occasionally, stars peeking through the clouds were blinking. Yang Maowu lit a bonfire and dried the comrades' clothes one by one. The bonfire reflected his tired face, constantly showing a satisfied smile. After drying the clothes of his own squad, he dried the clothes of other squads. Finally, the firewood ran out, and the clothes were not yet dry. "Should I just dry this much?" Yang Maowu touched the dry clothes and then touched the wet clothes, thinking, "No! These dry clothes are so comfortable to wear, and these wet clothes are so uncomfortable to wear. I'll stay up a little longer, and tomorrow all the comrades will wear dry clothes." So, he braced his tired body and groped up the mountain to cut firewood. He inadvertently touched a lacquer tree, and his face and hands gradually swelled up when he returned, and they were painful and itchy. But he persisted in drying all the comrades' clothes. By this time, it was already dawn. The comrades put on their warm, dry clothes and were very surprised. When they walked out of the tent, they saw Yang Maowu squatting beside the bonfire, drying his own cotton clothes. His hands and face were so swollen that they could hardly recognize him! The comrades were so moved that they almost shed tears.

　　When the road construction on Erlang Mountain ended, Yang Maowu had already realized his initial wish and became a member of the New Democratic Youth League.

　　The highway passed through Erlang Mountain and extended towards Zheduo Mountain and Que'er Mountain. The conditions became more and more difficult, and the tasks became more and more arduous. Yang Maowu felt his responsibility was even greater, and his work became even more active and diligent! In the Ganzi and Que'er Mountain projects, Yang Maowu successively created two new records, promoting the progress of the road construction project. One day, while drilling holes in the rock, Yang Maowu was not careful and a piece of rock that was blasted off hit him in the head. Blood flowed freely for a while, and he fainted to the ground. The comrades were preparing to carry him to the sanatorium at the foot of the mountain when he woke up. When he saw that they were going to send him down the mountain, he became anxious and immediately struggled to stand up and said that he could not agree. He gave many reasons why he should not be sent away. He said that this minor injury was not serious and that he could still do some light work. He said that at least he could stand guard. He said that at least he could help solve some ideological problems among the League members. Finally, the leadership issued an order before he was sent down the mountain.

　　In the spring of 1951, Yang Maowu attended the hero representative conference of the Engineering Corps Headquarters. When he returned to the garrison, representatives from each company went to the battalion headquarters to welcome him. The battalion commander personally toasted him, but he stood up and said, "What am I? Even if I have made some achievements, it is all thanks to the Party's cultivation and education, and thanks to the help of Comrade Guo Lijiang. I have always regarded Comrade Guo Lijiang as a role model for myself." Then he raised his glass and said loudly, "I think this glass of wine should be dedicated to Comrade Guo Lijiang!"

　　Now, Comrade Yang Maowu has been promoted to deputy platoon leader of a certain unit and continues to lead everyone in the battle on the Kangzang Plateau. (Attached image)

    进军康藏高原中的一个青年团员
    舒凡
    一九五○年的夏天。康藏高原的二郎山上。为了西进大军顺利通过，筑路部队正在赶架桥梁。眼看一座大桥就要架成，却短了两根桥桁不能完工。于是领导上立即派出十多个战士再去伐料。真是喜出望外，不到半天时间，他们终于砍倒了一棵大树，长约十丈，粗约两围，做两根桥桁绰绰有余。当这根木料顺着山坡滚滚而下的时候，伐料的人们一个个发出兴奋的欢呼。突然，只听得“卡嚓”一声，木料停止了滚动，凸出在山腰中的一块巨石挡住了它的去路。当时要是再伐一根木料，不但至少还得半天时间，而且不一定能够合乎桥梁需要的标准。要是把那块巨石挖掉，石头和木料急撞直下，挖石头的人又可能有生命的危险。正在大家面面相觑拿不定主意的当儿，忽然有一个人挺身而出，激昂地说道：“全连同志等着这根料架桥，多少部队等着这座桥通过，就看我们了，我去把石头挖掉！”这个人就是在三年前十八岁的时候被人称为“小英雄”的杨茂武，这个人就是在进军康藏前夕的决心书上写了：“不管它山有多高，雪有多厚，我一定克服困难，完成任务，争取做一个青年团员”豪语的杨茂武。
    这时同志们还不同意他去冒险，主张另作计议。可是杨茂武坚决要去。他想起了自己的班长共产党员郭立江。他想：“班长不是经常劝告大家要爱护自己的身体吗，因为我们还要建设共产主义社会，还要过共产主义社会的生活呢！可是在剿匪中，他却冒着弹雨去攻夺敌人的机枪阵地，难道班长就不知道危险吗！不是，那是任务要求他那样做。现在架桥的任务也要求我这样做，我应该像班长一样不怕一切危险！”于是他就挖着站脚的土坎，顺着陡坡向巨石走去。到了石头跟前，他先沿着石头的正面挖了一道浅沟，这时石头两侧泥土的阻力还可以支持木料的重量。然后他又站在石头两侧用力挖掘，石头渐渐松动了，杨茂武赶忙向一边躲开，这时巨石带着木料，猛冲下去，沙石四溅，声如山崩，杨茂武被震得立足不定，险些滚下山去。当同志们跑来营救时，他已经从地上爬了起来，擦了擦顺着耳朵流下来的鲜血，若无其事地走上了山坡。
    二郎山的夏天是霪雨的季节，由于任务紧急，部队冒雨施工，个个棉衣淋得透湿。同志们整天紧张劳动，晚上精疲力竭，谁也不去烘烤衣服，第二天又穿着湿漉漉的衣服开始工作。杨茂武想：“同志们每天穿着水湿的衣裳做工，日子长了能不生病吗？任务本来就紧，要是都病了谁去完成呢？”这时他又想起了自己的班长郭立江了。“要是班长在这里，他会怎么样呢？班长一定会牺牲自己的睡眠，把大家的衣服烤干，现在班长不在，我就应该这样做。”于是，他就从地上翻身起来，把全班同志的棉衣抱到帐篷外面。雨已停了，远处山尖上的白雪在黑色的夜空中闪闪发光，偶尔，从云缝间露出的星星在眨着眼睛。杨茂武点起篝火，一件一件地给同志们烤衣服。篝火映在他那疲困地脸上，不断浮现出满足的微笑。本班的烤完了，又烤别班的，最后柴烧光了，衣服还没有烤完。“是不是烤这么多就算了呢？”杨茂武摸摸烤干的衣服，又摸摸还湿着的衣服，心里想：“不能！这干衣服穿起来多舒服，这湿衣服穿起来多难受，我再熬一会，明天全体同志就都穿上干衣服了。”于是，他又强支着疲困的身体，摸到山上去砍柴。不提防摸在一棵漆树上，回来以后脸和手都渐渐肿起来了，又痛又痒。但他一直坚持着把全体同志的衣服都烤干了。这时天已发亮。同志们穿上暖烘烘的干衣服，都十分诧异。走出帐篷一看，杨茂武正蹲在篝火旁边烤他自己的棉衣，手和脸肿得他们都有点不大认得了！同志们都被感动得几乎流下泪来。
    二郎山修路结束时，杨茂武已经实现了自己的初步愿望，成为新民主主义青年团团员了。
    公路经过二郎山，向折多山和雀儿山修去，条件越来越困难，任务越来越艰巨。杨茂武更感到自己的责任重大，工作就更加积极努力了！在甘孜和雀儿山工程中，杨茂武连续创造了两次新纪录，推动了修路工程的进展。一天，在石岩上打炮眼，杨茂武没有当心炸起的一块石片砸在他的头上。一时鲜血直流，晕倒在地。同志们正准备把他抬到山下休养所去，他醒过来了。看到要送他下山，他急得什么似的，马上挣扎着站起表示不能同意。他找很多理由要求不要把他送走。他说这点轻伤不要紧，还可以做点轻活，他说起码还可以放哨，他说至少他还可以帮助解决团员中间的一些思想问题。最后领导上下了命令才把他送到山下。
    一九五一年的春天，杨茂武出席了工兵司令部的英雄代表会议，当他回到驻地时，各连派了代表到营部欢迎他。营首长亲自向他敬酒，他却站起来说：“我算什么呢？就是有一点成绩，也全靠党的培养和教育，全靠班长郭立江同志的帮助，我是一直把班长郭立江同志当作自己学习的榜样的。”接着他举起了酒杯，大声地说：“我觉得这一杯酒应该敬给班长郭立江同志！”
    现在，杨茂武同志已被提升为某部副排长，继续带动着大家战斗在康藏高原上。（附图片）
