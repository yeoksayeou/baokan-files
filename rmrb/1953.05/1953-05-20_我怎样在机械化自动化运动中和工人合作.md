How I Cooperate with Workers in the Mechanization and Automation Movement

Zhou Renyuan, Assistant Engineer, Small Rolling Mill, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

I came to work in Anshan in 1950. At that time, I would only approach the workers when I wanted to understand something from them, or to get something I needed from them, and I seemed to deliberately say to people, look, I also have a good relationship with the workers. In fact, deep down, I didn't think much of them. In the past, whenever I heard people say things like "the working class has wisdom and creativity," I always disagreed. I thought: what workers know is just the old routine, and many of them can't even read, how could they be smarter than me? Sometimes, in order to test whether my views were correct, I would deliberately ask them some deeper questions to see what they were really like. When the workers couldn't answer these questions, I became even more convinced of my views. It was this kind of thinking that prevented me from getting close to the worker comrades, underestimated their strength, and I don’t know how many valuable rationalization proposals were blocked by me.

In March 1951, after the first improvement of the heating furnace in the small plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the old worker Lu Naitao of the heating team saw that the furnace was not burning well and suggested to me: "The flame is burning like this, the air volume and pressure of the blower are not enough, they should be increased." At the time, I just casually replied, "The newly modified furnace, maybe the operation is not skilled, we’ll study it later!" I didn't pay attention to his opinion at all. It wasn't until more than half a year later that this opinion was accepted by another technician, Wu Liangya. In fact, after increasing the air volume and pressure, the thermal efficiency of the furnace increased by more than 20%, which played a significant role in improving the production capacity of the heating furnace. However, such things did not immediately awaken me.

In June 1952, the old worker Han Changxin of the oxygen welding team proposed to me to make an automatic steel-turning machine for the rough rolling mill. At that time, I didn't believe that Han Changxin could have such a creation, and just perfunctorily said to him: "We'll study it later." At that time, I thought, how could a worker like him, who doesn't even have enough scientific theoretical knowledge of oxygen welding, and only knows how to cut and weld, have any inventions? But Han Changxin was not discouraged, he kept looking for me seven or eight times, and even made a model for me to see. As for me, I just said I was busy and didn't want to talk to him. Once, he saw me and said, "I know you are busy, just give me five minutes, okay?" I said, "Okay, tell me." After he finished talking about the entire content of his proposal, the research process, and what he was inspired by, I gave him this answer: "Some of what you said is not new, and some can be tested incidentally." At this time, I had just drafted a design plan for a steel-turning machine and drawn detailed drawings. Han Changxin's plan and my plan were both taken to the Soviet expert to consult. But the expert adopted Han Changxin's plan and not mine. I myself felt very strange, why did the expert not adopt mine but adopted the suggestion of an ordinary worker? Could it be that the books I read in the past were for nothing? I was very sad at the time. It wasn't until Zhang Mingshan's "anti-circumferential disk" experiment was successful in our small factory, and until Han Changxin's steel-turning machine was also successfully tested later, that I suddenly realized.

In September 1952, when the factory was testing the "anti-circumferential disk" invented by Zhang Mingshan, I didn't believe in Zhang Mingshan's creation. But later the experiment was successful, which aroused my attention. I found that although Zhang Mingshan had little education, he was an old worker, familiar with the spare parts of rolling, and deeply knew the performance and technical requirements of various spare parts of rolling. He had practical experience, although he couldn't explain the principle, he could find out the laws of things from specific facts, and then further apply them to production. Although I had read more books in the past, I couldn't solve these practical problems. At this time, I realized that I should not only recognize the things in books, but also recognize the experience that people are accumulating in labor. The worker comrades have a high degree of class sympathy and the determination to resolutely relieve the suffering of the workers; although they lack theoretical guidance, they are tenacious and persistent, and will eventually overcome difficulties. Han Changxin was like this, so his steel-turning machine was finally successfully created. He is an old worker, he labors himself and deeply knows the process of turning steel. But because I didn't specifically help him solve the difficulties encountered in the drawings, theoretical calculations, and mechanical analysis, it made him fight alone, prolonged the creation time, and made him take unnecessary detours. These actual situations educated me, a very apologetic feeling attacked me, at this time, I began to consider that I should do my part in the mechanization and automation movement.

In January 1953, Liu Jiacai, a technician promoted from an old worker, and Kang Zhaowen, deputy secretary of the small factory's Party committee, said to me that the original steel-turning machine in the south of the rough rolling mill was not working well and should be changed to a flap-type, using the weight of the steel bar itself to make it fall. After a period of consideration, I analyzed the principle of turning steel and dropping steel, and began to draw a sketch according to their meaning, and handed it over to the workers Sun Changyuan and others of the riveting and welding joint group for production. During the production, I often talked with them, and solicited their opinions in many ways on the production and use. When the workers saw that I was humble, they also conducted very detailed research. The workers Sun Baochen and Wu Xingyan made the important suggestion of adding small movable wheels on the flap to make the steel bars shoot out farther after leaving the rolling mill, so as not to be caught in the guide plate basket and unable to be turned over. Due to the concentration of everyone's wisdom, this steel-turning machine was successfully tested in January this year. The creation of the automatic recorder is also like this. It is an electrical calculator that records the number of finished steel bars. The old electrical worker Zhao Enqing understood the principle of the power calculator and put forward a specific production plan according to the actual situation. After joint research by the old electrical worker Sun Shiping, the old lathe worker Gao Guangzhen, and the worker technician Xu Rongguo, I drew a sketch, which was specifically produced by Zhao Enqing. In the production process, many problems related to electrical coils, joints, drawbars, etc., were his own creations, and after testing, they worked perfectly.

I saw that the workers were enthusiastically投入ing themselves into the mechanization and automation movement, and personally saw them发挥ing their infinite wisdom; at this time, I was very happy to be able to help them come up with some ideas and do my part. Due to my initial approach to the worker comrades, not only did I understand some things that I didn't understand in the past, but I also knew how to apply them. For example, after the coiling machine was installed, it didn't work very well, so I took the initiative to召集 the original proposer, worker technician Xu Rongguo, producers and installers Li Chunquan, Sun Shiping, Zhao Enqing, Yang Pengfei, etc., as well as operators and users Gao Yunshan and Wang Diansen to find a solution. As a result, Sun Shiping proposed a solution, and after everyone's joint research, it was completed in early March and was completely successful after testing. From then on, the coiling machine no longer required manual labor. In the past, I only knew that the original one was not working well, but I couldn't say exactly where the problem was? With the actual operating experience of the worker comrades, the correct viewpoint starting from reality, and the concentration of everyone's wisdom, any difficult problem can be solved smoothly. Since I started to have some contact with the worker comrades, when the workers felt that I could give them some help, they took the initiative to find me. For example, the automatic wire tying machine in the finishing process, the automatic small shear for the cooling bed, the automatic iron cutting of the shear, etc., have now obtained specific implementation plans. I have gradually become their true comrade in this way, and I have also gained a lot of knowledge in this process, which makes me more confident in doing my work well.

    我怎样在机械化自动化运动中和工人合作
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂助理工程师　周任源
    我在一九五○年到鞍山工作。那时候，我只在想从工人那里了解一些事情，或者从他们那里取得一些我所需要的东西的时候，才去接近他们，并且好像有意对人说，你看，我和工人也结合得不错呀。实际上，在思想深处，我是不大看得起他们的。从前，我每逢听到有些人说“工人阶级有智慧，有创造性”等等的时候，总是不以为然。我想：工人们所知道的，还不是那老一套，他们很多人连字也不认识，怎么会比我高明呢？有时候，我为了要试试我的看法是否有道理，我曾故意问他们一些较深的问题，看看他们到底怎么样。工人们有时答不上这些问题，我就更加肯定了我的看法。就是这种思想，阻止了我和工人同志们的接近，低估了他们的力量，不知道有多少有价值的合理化建议，到了我的手里，都被挡回去了。
    一九五一年三月间，鞍山钢铁公司小型厂加热炉进行了第一次的改进以后，加热班老工人卢乃涛看见炉子燃烧的情况不太好，就向我提出：“这样燃烧的火焰，鼓风机的风量和风压都不够，要增加才好。”我当时只是不在意地回答说：“新改的炉子，可能是操作不熟练，以后看看再研究吧！”我根本没有重视他的意见。一直过了半年多，这个意见才被另外一位技术员吴良亚接受了。实际上，经过提高风量和风压之后，炉子的热效率增加了百分之二十以上，这对提高加热炉的生产能力有着很大的作用。然而这样的事情，并没有使我马上觉醒。
    到一九五二年六月，氧焊班老工人韩长信向我提出要做毛轧机的自动翻钢机。当时我不相信韩长信能有这样的创造，只是敷衍地对他说：“以后再研究吧。”当时我想，像他这样一个工人，连氧焊的科学理论知识都不够，只知道照样割断和熔接，他能有什么发明创造呢？但是韩长信并没有灰心，他一直找过我七八次，并且还做了模型给我看。我呢，只说忙，话也不愿意和他谈。有一次，他见了我，对我说：“我知道你忙，只给我谈五分钟的话，好不好？”我说：“好，你说吧。”等他说完了他的全部建议的内容和研究的过程，以及受了什么东西的启发之后，我对他作了这样的答复：“你所说的，有的不是什么新东西，有的还可以附带试验试验。”这时候，我刚拟出了一个翻钢机设计的方案，并且画出了详细的图纸。韩长信的方案和我的方案都被拿到苏联专家那里，去请教苏联专家。但专家采取了韩长信的，而没有采取我的。我自己觉得很奇怪，为什么专家不采取我的而采取一个普通工人的建议呢？难道我过去念的书都白念了？我当时非常难过。直到我们小型厂张明山的“反围盘”试验成功，直到后来韩长信的翻钢机也试验成功了，我才恍然大悟。
    一九五二年九月间，工厂试验张明山所发明的“反围盘”的时候，我是不相信张明山的创造的。但是后来试验成功了，这才引起了我的注意。我发现张明山虽然文化浅，但他是老工人，熟悉了压延的备品，深知道压延各种备品的性能和技术要求。他有实际经验，虽然说不出原理来，但他却能从具体的事实中，摸出事物的规律，然后进一步应用到生产中去。我过去虽然多念了些书，对这些实际的问题，却无法解决。到这时候，我才想到既应该承认书本上的东西，也应该承认人们正在劳动中积累的经验。工人同志们有高度的阶级同情心，具有坚决解除工人切身痛苦的决心；他们虽然缺乏理论的指导，但他们顽强，坚毅，结果终会战胜了困难。韩长信就是这样，所以他的翻钢机后来终于创造成功了。他是一个老工人，他亲身劳动，深切地知道翻钢动作的过程。但由于我没有具体地帮助他解决图纸上和理论计算上以及力学分析上所遇到的困难，竟使得他孤军奋斗，延长了创造的时间，使他走了不必要走的弯路。这些实际情况教育了我，一种非常歉疚的心情袭击着我，在这时候，我才开始考虑到，我应该在机械化自动化的运动中尽我一份力量。
    一九五三年一月，由老工人提升的技师刘家财和小型厂党委会副书记康兆文对我说，毛轧机南部原来的翻钢机不好使，应该改为翻板式的，利用钢条本身的重量使它下坠。我经过了一段时间的考虑，分析了翻钢掉钢的道理，就开始按照他们的意思，绘出了草图，交给铆焊联合小组的工人孙长元等制作。在制作的时候，我经常和他们谈话，在制作上和使用上多方征求他们的意见。工人看见我虚心了，也就非常细致地进行研究。工人孙宝臣、吴兴岩提出在翻板上面添加小活动轮，使钢条出轧钢机后射出较远，不致夹在导板筐内没法翻掉的重要建议。由于集中了大家的智慧，这个翻钢机在今年一月间顺利地试验成功了。自动纪录器的创造，也是这样。它是记录钢条成品数量的一个电气计算器，电气老工人赵恩庆体会了电力计算器的道理，根据实际情况，提出具体制作的方案。经过电气老工人孙式平，车工老工人高光振，工人技术员徐荣国等共同研究，由我绘出了草图，由赵恩庆具体制作。在制作过程中，许多有关电气线圈、接头、拉杆等等问题，都是他本人的创造，经试验后，完全好用。
    我看到工人们一个个都热情地投入机械化自动化运动中，并亲眼看到他们发挥了无限的智慧；在这时候，我能帮助他们出一些主意，尽一份力量，我是很愉快的。由于我和工人同志们有了初步的接近，过去有些不懂的东西，现在不但懂了，而且也知道了如何去应用。譬如卷线机安装后，不太好使，我就主动地召集了原建议人、工人技术员徐荣国、制作、安装者李春泉、孙式平、赵恩庆、杨鹏飞等，以及操作使用的高云山、王殿森来想办法。结果孙式平提出了解决的办法，经大家共同研究后，三月初制作完成，并经试验完全成功，从此，卷线机就再也不用人力了。过去我只知道原装的不好用，但是却说不出问题究竟在那里？有了工人同志们实际的操作经验，有从实际出发的正确观点，集中了大家的智慧，这样，任何困难的问题就能顺利地解决。自从我和工人同志们开始有了一些联系，工人们觉得我能给他们一些帮助时，他们就主动地找我了。如精整工序的自动捆铁机，冷却床自动小剪，剪断机的自动切铁等等问题，现在都已经得到具体的实现方案了。我就这样逐渐地成为他们的真正的同志，而我自己也在这当中获得了很多知识，使自己更有信心做好自己的工作。
