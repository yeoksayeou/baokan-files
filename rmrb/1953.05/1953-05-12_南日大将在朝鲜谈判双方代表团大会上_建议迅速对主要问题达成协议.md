Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 11th: The Korean and Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued the following communique on May 11th:

    The two delegations held a meeting on May 11th.

    At the meeting, our chief representative, General Nam Il, addressed the other side's remarks and questions raised on the 10th, stating:

    "Our side believes that if, after explanation by the relevant side within a certain period, there are still remaining prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the issue of their handling should be submitted to a higher-level political conference for consultation and resolution. Your side's assertion that the political conference cannot reasonably resolve this issue is untenable. Our side has repeatedly pointed out that the so-called forced repatriation is completely unfounded, and our side does not recognize the existence of so-called prisoners of war who refuse repatriation. Therefore, if, completely free from the control and influence of the detaining side, there are prisoners of war who, after a certain period of explanation by the relevant side, still harbor doubts and fears and do not dare to return home, the handling of these prisoners of war, according to the nature of the issue, can only be reasonably resolved by a higher-level political conference. Rejecting the submission of issues that should be submitted to the political conference to the political conference, based on the untenable assumption that the higher-level political conference cannot resolve them, is completely unjustified. Our side firmly insists that this issue should be submitted to the political conference.

    Some of the specific details you raised at yesterday's meeting are obviously easier to negotiate and determine after the two sides reach an agreement on the main issues, while others are not problematic. Regarding these types of specific details, our side has clearly stated that after the two sides reach an agreement on the main issues, it is not difficult to seek a solution that is satisfactory to both sides on a reasonable and practical basis. Our side believes that the two delegations should not waste energy lingering on the assumptions of detailed issues, but should quickly reach an agreement on the main issues in order to enter into the determination of specific details and achieve a Korean armistice.

    Since the resumption of the plenary meeting, our side has put forward the six-point concrete implementation plan of April 26th, and we still believe that this plan is more reasonable. However, because your side insists on the claim of leaving the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea, our side, in addition to retaining our April 26th plan, put forward a new eight-point plan on May 7th, attempting to adopt your side's claim of leaving the prisoners of war in Korea to be taken over by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Our side has also made due and sufficient explanations to our new plan regarding the questions raised by your side. We believe that there is now no reason to delay reaching an agreement on the main issues contained in our plan."

    In addition to reiterating its unfounded assumption that a higher-level political conference would be unable to handle the remaining prisoners of war, the other side raised the issue at the meeting that the four-month period for the prisoner of war's own side to explain to the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war was too long, as well as other specific details.

    General Nam Il immediately reiterated our side's clear position, and pointed out that after considering the other side's opinions, our side had changed the period for the prisoner of war's own country to explain to the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war from the six months stipulated in our April 26th plan to the four months stipulated in our new May 7th plan. Our side believes that the four-month period is completely reasonable.

    General Nam Il pointed out that since the resumption of the delegation's plenary meeting, our side has repeatedly made great efforts to promote the early realization of a Korean armistice. Our side has repeatedly stated that after an agreement is reached on the main issues, it will not be difficult to find a fair solution to the details on a reasonable and practical basis. There is no reason to delay the agreement on the main issues with details. General Nam Il finally suggested again that the two sides quickly reach an agreement on the main issues contained in our plan, so as to immediately enter into the determination of specific details. The two sides are scheduled to continue to hold a delegation meeting at 11:00 a.m. on May 12th.

    南日大将在朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会上
    建议迅速对主要问题达成协议
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月十一日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团五月十一日举行会议。
    会上我方首席代表南日大将针对对方十日发言及所提问题指出：
    “我方认为如果经过在一定期限内的有关一方的解释，还有在中立国遣返委员会看管下的剩余战俘，他们的处理问题应提交高一级的政治会议协商解决。你方断定政治会议不能合理解决这个问题的论点，是站不住的，我方已经多次指出所谓强迫遣返之说，根本不能成立，我方根本不承认有所谓拒绝遣返的战俘。因此，如果在完全脱离了拘留一方的控制和影响的情况下，经过一定时期内有关一方的解释，仍有心怀疑惧不敢回家的不直接遣返的战俘，对于这些战俘的处理，根据问题的性质，只有高一级的政治会议，才能予以合理解决。以高一级的政治会议不能解决的站不住的假定为前提，拒绝将应该提交政治会议解决的问题提交政治会议，是完全没有理由的。我方坚决主张这个问题应该提交政治会议。
    你方在昨天的会上所又提出的一些具体细节问题，有一部分很显然是在双方对主要问题达成协议后，易于协商确定的，另一部分则是不能成为问题的。关于这类具体细节问题，我方已经明白表示在双方对于主要问题达成协议后，是不难在合理和实际的基础上，求得对双方满意的解决。我方认为目前双方代表团不应留在细节问题的设想上浪费精力，而应该迅速对主要问题达成协议，以便进入具体细节的商定，实现朝鲜停战。
    大会复会以来，我方就提出了四月二十六日的六点具体实施方案，我们至今仍然认为这个方案是更为合理的。但由于你方坚持将不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜的主张，我方又在保留我方四月二十六日方案以外，提出了五月七日的新的八点方案，试图采用你方将战俘留在朝鲜由中立国遣返委员会来朝鲜接管的主张。我方并就你方所提出的问题，对我方新方案作了应有的充分的说明。我们认为现在已没有任何理由拖延对我方方案所包含的主要问题达成协议。”
    对方在会上除重复其高一级政治会议将无法处理最后剩余战俘的毫无根据的假设外，又提出了战俘所属一方向未被直接遣返的战俘进行解释的四个月的期限为太长，以及其他一些具体细节问题。
    南日大将当即重申了我方明确的立场，并指出：在考虑了对方的意见后，我方已将战俘所属国家向未被直接遣返的战俘进行解释的期限，从我们四月二十六日方案中所规定的六个月，改为我方五月七日新方案中所规定的四个月。我方认为四个月的期限是完全合理的。
    南日大将指出：自代表团大会复会以来，为了促成朝鲜停战的早日实现，我方已一再作了极大的努力，我方并已多次表示在主要问题达成协议后，细节问题不难在合理和实际的基础上求得对双方都公平的解决，没有任何理由再以细节问题来拖延对主要问题的协议。南日大将最后再次建议双方迅速对我方方案所包含的主要问题达成协议，以便立即进入具体细节问题的商定。双方定于五月十二日上午十一时继续举行代表团大会。
