    On Illustrations in Literary Books
    Wang Chaowen

    Readers need to read literary books and appreciate the illustrations within them. However, newly published literary works rarely have illustrated versions nowadays. Even when they do exist, they are rarely satisfactory. Even some of Lu Xun's great works, who advocated for illustrations, still haven't seen the publication of beautifully illustrated editions to this day. The lack of illustrations in literary books and the poor quality of existing illustrations should be changed.

    The People's Literature Publishing House recently published a series of "Elementary Literary Readings," each with illustrations, and the publisher announced that it will continue to do so in the future. Among magazines and periodicals, "New Observer" pays attention to illustration work. These should be considered good beginnings. But to do this work well, it is not enough to rely solely on the promotion, organization, and leadership of publishing institutions; more importantly, artists should value illustration work, illustration authors should change their perfunctory style, improve their painting skills, and fully grasp the characteristics of this painting style of illustration.

    The illustrations in "Elementary Literary Readings" are not all well-drawn. For example, the illustrations for "Struggling Against Qian Wengui" (by Situ Qiao), "Landmine Warfare" (by Sun Xin), "Luo Cai Fights the Tiger" (by Gu Qun), and "Battle of Shajiadian" (by Feng Zhen) have images that are empty, stiff, even ugly, and brushstrokes that are slick, hasty, dry, monotonous, and dull, to the point that they not only fail to make the images in the novel more concrete but are even inadequate as decorations for the books. Currently, the better works I have seen are the illustrations made by the painter Situ Qiao for Lu Xun's novel "My Old Home," especially the one depicting the meeting between Lu Xun and Runtu.

    Readers who have read "My Old Home" will remember that the middle-aged farmer Runtu was full of vitality in his youth. Later, tormented by "many children, famine, heavy taxes, soldiers, bandits, officials, and gentry" [Note 1], he, like his father, succumbed to an unhappy life and completely lost the brilliance of his youth, becoming a pathetic figure close to numbness. "His former purplish-red round face had turned greyish-yellow and was covered with deep wrinkles; his eyes, like his father's, were swollen and red all around," "His hands were no longer the ruddy, plump hands I remembered, but coarse, clumsy, and chapped, like pine bark." Runtu had long wanted to see his childhood friend Lu Xun, but he was stunned in front of his friend, "a look of joy and sorrow on his face," calling his friend "Master" and asking his son to "kowtow to the Master." Situ Qiao's illustration of Runtu is based on these characteristics. This painting basically conforms to the description in the novel and helps to clarify the theme of the novel, which is emphasized by Mr. Lu Xun in the novel: "They should have a new life, a life we have not yet lived." Secondly, Runtu's son, Shu-sheng, "was just like Runtu of twenty years ago, only thinner and more sallow, without the silver ring around his neck." Although the image of this young boy in the illustration is not as well-drawn as the image of Runtu, it can still evoke the reader's association: the fate of the unfortunate continues from generation to generation. Because this illustration chooses a moving scene in the novel to be visualized, and when the people have changed the fate that was once like Runtu's and stood up today, they cannot but be moved by such a novel and illustration; thus, they feel the loveliness of today's "life we have not yet lived" even more, and strengthen the enthusiasm for striving for the realization of a happier tomorrow.

    The main feature of this illustration lies in its ability to exert the relative independence and necessary subordination that illustrations should have.

    What are the independence and subordination of illustrations? That is: illustrations must possess the conditions of general painting art, and at the same time, must obey the original literary work. It must not only obtain the vividness of the modeling that cannot be replaced by the specific description of the original literary work, but also must be closely combined with the content of the original work. The former is the relative independence of the illustration, and the latter is the necessary subordination of the illustration. The relationship between the two is interdependent, not incompatible. If it does not start from the original literary work, one-sidedly emphasizes the characteristics of plastic art, or the image of the painting is too poor, it will lose its subordination and also lose its independence.

    The reason why this illustration can exert the special skills of illustration is that it breaks through the common situation in illustration work: failing to grasp the spirit of the novel, failing to grasp the plot that can clarify the theme of the novel and is easy to use the image of painting to express, simply extracting some words and sentences for the sake of easy drawing, making a superficial translation of the text; in addition, the modeling is very poor and boring, so that the picture and the novel cannot be closely coordinated to express the theme of the novel in a concentrated and prominent way, but instead become a dispensable appendage. The "My Old Home" illustration was not "created" in this way, so the effect is different. According to the author, Situ Qiao, before the creation, he repeatedly read "My Old Home," was deeply moved, understood the theme of the novel and the emotions of the author, felt the character of the characters and the state of mind, and repeatedly deliberated on the shape of Runtu, repeatedly revising the draft. Because of this, this illustration can avoid the shortcomings of the illustration of "Struggling Against Qian Wengui" and conforms to the characteristics of this style of illustration.

    The illustrator treats the original literary work like an actor treats a script, which is a re-creative work. Under the premise of conforming to the spirit of the original work, in order to adapt to the characteristics of illustration art (the exertion of relative independence and subordination), focusing on depicting certain phenomena that must be emphasized, or not drawing certain characters and other phenomena that appear in the same instant and in the same place of the novel, is not only permissible, but also should be done. The "My Old Home" illustration does not rigidly obey every sentence of the novel, and not depicting the broken felt hat on Runtu's head, and drawing the paper bag in his hand not as being held but as being hugged, should be said to be a way of not harming the spirit of the original work. The author deletes the background of Lu Xun sitting and drinking tea and other trivial phenomena, emphasizing the "sorrowful" expression of Runtu when he sees his old friend but not emphasizing his "joyful" expression, not emphasizing Lu Xun's "surprise" and "excitement" but emphasizing his sympathy for Runtu, which is a creative and correct way to help clarify the spirit of the original work.

    As an illustration for a literary work, if it is required to be not an appendage of literature, but a fine art work that not only has the cooperative role of subordinating to the original work but also has independence, then it must fully exert the special skills of modeling art - vividly and concretely shaping a visible image. Only when the image is clear, definite, moving, giving an unforgettable impression, and has a general nature, is it conducive to inspiring imagination and association, it is not dependent on the words of the literary work to make annotations, and it can better assist the original literary work. That is to say, the strength of the effect of cooperating with the text is based on the strength of its independence. The more accurately and concretely the illustration can shape the image, the more the painting has independence, and the more it is conducive to clarifying the content of the novel and exerting a greater cooperative effect.

    In order to facilitate the explanation of this issue, it is best to appreciate the illustrations made by the famous Soviet illustrator En. Zhukov for Polevoi's novel "A Real Man."

    Here I take the illustration depicting the peasant woman Varvara as an example. As an independent painting depicting a resolute and beautiful young woman who is staring at a certain thing with melancholy and immersed in contemplation, it is an excellent painting. Even if we do not look at the words of the novel, like facing other excellent paintings that are good at depicting psychological states, such as Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" and La. Metiyansi's "Big Beard" [Note 2], readers cannot but be moved by this image that they want to see more and more. This is definitely not like some bad works with weak images and vague content that "read words to recognize pictures." This is a good work with the independence and integrity of illustration. It is obvious that if you do not digest the content of the original work and do not go deep into the heart of the character, you cannot obtain the independence that the illustration should have. Because paintings that are good at depicting the external form cannot stop at the depiction of the external form, in order to shape the external form with psychological and emotional characteristics, such as the formation of such an excellent image as Varvara, it cannot but be attributed to the author's deep feelings for the novel.

    Since the illustration must be closely combined with the novel to produce a good effect of "complementing each other," then it must, like the Varvara painted by En. Zhukov, fit her spirit when she is guarding - the hero Meresjev [Note 3] who is in a semi-comatose state and is so thin that only a skeleton remains, not a general independent painting. The novel describes it like this:
      Varvara sat with her legs crossed, her chin buried in her knees, and stared sadly with round,
    melancholy eyes, sitting by him all night.
    She put a cloth soaked in cold water on his head for a while, and on his chest for a while, and
    pulled up the sheepskin coat that he kept throwing off, while thinking about her husband who was thousands of miles
    away, not knowing where he was blown by the war wind. (Chinese version of the Times Publishing House, page 98) After seeing such an illustration and reading such words, even if Varvara's other actions are not made into illustrations, we can also associate this capable, taciturn, and young woman, the military family member whose newly married husband has been missing for a long time on the front line of the Patriotic War, and the patriotism of treating Soviet heroes like their own flesh and blood, in other activities in other places, so we can associate the noble behavior of many other Soviet women who love heroes and love their country. In order to highlight and vividly shape the image, in order to facilitate the inspiration of association, the illustration that obeys the novel without being bound by the novel should strive to be concise in the selection of materials (although it cannot be assumed that the illustration can only depict the smallest possible local parts and fragments, and that all-encompassing large scenes are not suitable for illustration). Perhaps, it is precisely because En. Zhukov only depicts Varvara guarding the patient without drawing the person being guarded and others, thus not only showing her importance in a certain plot, but also making it easier to induce readers to exert association and imagination? However, although the illustration does not have to depict everything in a certain scene, the part that has been depicted must show its relationship with other parts. Just as the specific mental state shown by Varvara's posture, expression, and direction of sight in the illustration can break through the limitations of the picture and can make people associate with Meresjev and others on the limited picture that has not appeared. Other illustrations of "A Real Man," such as Anyuta who is happy because she received a letter from the front, and Olya [Note 4] who is resisting the cold and fatigue and is digging trenches and thinking about the people in front, all show their relationship with other characters and events, rather than any isolated static fragment of the phenomenon, so these local things that appear on the screen entrust more content.

    The independence and cooperative effect (or subordination) of the illustration can be completely unified. As long as you are good at deeply understanding the original work and exerting the role of modeling art, the special skills of illustration art can be fully exerted; like En. Zhukov's illustrations, it is entirely possible to create beautiful works with a high degree of art.

    We still lack such beautiful illustrations as "A Real Man," but the masses are looking forward to the timely appearance of such beautiful illustrations. The question is whether the painter values ​​this work, and whether he is working harder to strive for the necessary conditions for creatively completing this work task.

    [Note 1] The words and sentences in parentheses in this article, which do not indicate the source, are all quoted from the novel "My Old Home."
    [Note 2] It depicts the head of an old man with a long beard. The law of light is used close to the law of Rembrandt, and the important part (eyes) is particularly clear. The spirit of the eyes shows indignation, as if he is hostile to something that exists outside the picture and is opposed to him.
    [Note 3] The wounded pilot crawled in the snow for eighteen days and nights, and overcame the threat of death with his superhuman perseverance and returned to the embrace of the motherland.
    [Note 4] The former is the lover of another hero tank driver Gvozdev in the book, and the latter is the lover of the protagonist Meresjev in the novel. They are both heroes in the making, real people.

    谈文学书籍的插图
    王朝闻
    读者需要阅读文学书籍，也需要欣赏文学书籍中的插图。可是，现在出版的新文学作品却很少有插图的版本。即使有，也很少是令人满意的。连提倡插图的鲁迅先生的一些伟大作品，至今也还是没有精美插图本问世。文学书籍缺少插图和插图简陋的状况，应该加以改变。
    人民文学出版社最近出版了一种“文学初步读物”，每本都有插图，而且出版社宣告以后要继续这样做。在杂志刊物中，“新观察”是注意插图工作的。这些，应该说是好的开始。但要使这一工作做好，仅仅依靠出版机关的提倡、组织领导，还是不够；更重要的，是美术家应该重视插图工作，插图作者应该改变粗制滥造的作风，应该提高自己的绘画技巧，充分掌握插图这一绘画样式的特点。
    “文学初步读物”的插图，有些画得不大好。例如“斗争钱文贵”（司徒乔作）、“地雷阵”（孙信作）、“罗才打虎”（顾群作）、“沙家店战斗”（冯真作）的插图，有的形象空虚、呆板，甚至丑恶，有的笔墨油滑、潦草、干瘪、单调乏味，以致不但不能使小说中的形象更加具体化，甚至连装饰书籍的作用都很不够。目前，我所见到的比较好的作品，是画家司徒乔为鲁迅小说“故乡”所作的插图，特别是描写鲁迅和闰土会见的那一幅。
    读过“故乡”的读者当能记得，中年农民闰土，在他的少年时代，是富有生命力的。后来，受了“多子、饥荒、苛税、兵、匪、官、绅”〔注一〕的折磨，正如他父亲一样，屈服于不幸的生活，完全丧失了少年时期的光彩，变成近似麻木的可怜的人物。“先前的紫色的圆脸，已经变作灰黄，而且加上了很深的皱纹；眼睛也像他父亲一样，周围都肿得通红”，“那手也不是我所记得的红活圆实的手，却又粗又笨而且开裂，像是松树皮了。”闰土早就想一见少年时的朋友——鲁迅，却在朋友面前呆住了，“脸上现出欢喜和凄凉的神情”，用“老爷”的称呼来称呼朋友，并要他的儿子“给老爷磕头”。司徒乔的插图中的闰土，就是根据这些特点来塑造的。这幅画，基本上符合小说的描写，有利于小说主题的阐明，这主题是鲁迅先生在小说中所强调的：“他们应该有新的生活，为我们所未经生活过的。”其次，闰土的儿子水生，“这正是一个二十年前的闰土，只是黄瘦些，颈子上没有银圈罢了。”插图中的这一少年的形象虽不如闰土这个形象画得好，但也能够唤起读者的联想：不幸者的命运还在一代继续一代。正因为这一插图选择了小说中的一个动人的场面来加以形象化，当人民已经改变了曾经是闰土一样的命运而站立起来了的今天，对着这样的小说和插图，也不能不感动；因而更感到今天的“所未经生活过的”生活的可爱，增强了争取更幸福的明天的实现的热情。
    这幅插图的主要特点，在于它发挥了插图应有的相对的独立性和必要的从属性。
    什么是插图的独立性和从属性呢？那就是：插图必须具备一般绘画艺术的条件，同时必须服从文学原作。既要获得文学原作的具体描写所不能代替的造形的鲜明性，同时必须使它和原作的内容紧密结合。前者就是插图的相对独立性，后者就是插图应有的从属性。两者的关系是相互依存的，而不是不相容的。如果不从文学原作出发，片面强调造形艺术的特质，或者绘画的形象性太差，那就要失却它的从属性，也不能不失却它的独立性。
    这幅插图之所以能够发挥插图的特长，由于它突破了插图工作中普遍存在着的这种情况：掌握不住小说的精神，抓不住能够阐明小说主题和便于运用绘画的形象来表现的情节，单是为了容易画，就随便抽出一些字句，给文字作肤浅的翻译；加以造形性很差，乏味，因而不能使图画和小说紧密配合，集中地突出地表达了小说主题，而是成为可有可无的附属品。“故乡”的插图不是这样“创造”出来的，因而效果也就不同。据作者司徒乔谈，在创作前，他曾把“故乡”反复阅读，很受感动，体会了小说的主题和小说作者的情感，感受了人物的性格和情绪状态，在闰土的造形上反复推敲，一再易稿。正因为这样，这一插图能够避免了“斗争钱文贵”的插图的缺点，符合了插图这一样式的特点。
    插图作者对待文学原作，如同演员对待剧本一样，是一种再创造的工作。在符合原作精神的前提之下，为了适应插图艺术的特点（相对的独立性和从属性的发挥），着重描写某些必须强调的现象，或不画某些出现于小说的同一瞬间同一场所之下的人物及其他现象，不仅是容许的，而且是应该的。“故乡”这一插图，不呆板服从小说的每一句话，不描画闰土头上的破毡帽，手里的纸包不是画成提着而画成抱着的样子，应该说是不损害原作精神的办法。作者删除了鲁迅坐着喝茶时的背景等等琐屑现象，强调闰土见了故人时的“凄凉”神气而不强调其“欢喜”的神气，不强调鲁迅的“惊讶”和“兴奋”而强调他对闰土的同情，更是有利于原作精神的阐明的具有创造性的正确办法。
    作为文学作品的插图，如果要求它不是文学的附庸，而是既有从属原著的配合作用又是具有独立性的美术作品，那就必须充分发挥造型艺术的特长——鲜明地具体地塑造出可视的形象。只有形象清晰、明确、动人，给人不能忘却的印象，具有概括性，有利于启发想像和联想，它才是既不依赖文学作品的文字来作注解，而且更能辅助文学原作。这就是说，配合文字的作用的强弱，基于它的独立性的强弱。愈是能够确切地具体地塑造形象的插图，那就愈有绘画的独立性，也就愈是有利于小说内容的阐明，发挥较大的配合作用。
    为了便于说明这一问题，最好是欣赏苏联有名的插图画家恩·茹可夫为波列伏依的小说“真正的人”所作的那些插图。
    此处我举描绘农家少妇华尔华拉那幅插图为例。作为描写一个忧郁地凝视着一定的事物、陷入沉思中的刚毅而美丽的少妇的独立的绘画来看，它是一幅杰出的绘画。我们尽管不看小说的文字，如同面对善于描写心理状态的其他卓越的绘画，例如达·芬奇的“蒙娜丽莎”，拉·湄提扬思奇的“大胡子”〔注二〕一样，读者不能不被这种愈看愈想看的形象所感动。这决不像某些“看字识图”的形象贫弱因而内容含糊的坏作品。这是具有插图的独立性、完整性的好作品。很明显，如果没有消化原作的内容，不是深入人物内心，就不能获得插图应有的独立性。因为长于描写外形的绘画，不能停止于外形的描写，为了塑造出具有心理的情绪的特征的外形，如像华尔华拉这样优秀的形象的形成，不能不归功于作者对于小说的深入感受。
    插图既然必须和小说紧密结合，产生“相得益彰”的好效果，那么，它又必须像恩·茹可夫所画的华尔华拉那样，切合她那守护着——正处于半昏迷状态中的瘦弱得只剩下一把骨头的英雄密里席叶夫〔注三〕时的神气，而不是一般的独立的绘画。小说是这样描写的：
      华尔华拉盘了腿，下颔埋在膝部，用圆圆的、
    忧郁的大眼睛悲哀地注视着，在他旁边坐了一夜。
    她把一块用冷水浸湿的布一会放在他的头上，一
    会放在胸部，给他拉好他不断扔掉的皮袄，一边
    想到自己在千里外的，不知被战风吹到何处的人
    儿。（时代出版社中文版九八页）看了这样的插画又读了这样的文字，即令华尔华拉的其他行动没有被画成插画，我们也能够联想到这一能干、沉默寡言和年轻的妇人，新婚的丈夫在卫国战争的前线久无消息的军属，像对待自己骨肉一样对待苏联英雄的爱国主义者，在其他场所的其他活动，从而可以联想到其他许多热爱英雄、热爱祖国的苏联妇女的高贵的行为。为了突出地鲜明地塑造形象，为了便于启发联想，服从小说而不被小说所拘束的插图，在取材上，应该力求精简（虽然不能以为插图只可以描写尽可能小的局部和片段，包罗万象的大场面是不宜于作插图的）。也许，正因为恩·茹可夫只描写了守护病人的华尔华拉而不画被守护者及其他，因而不仅显出她在一定情节中的重要性，而且更便于诱导读者发挥联想和想像的吧？然而，插图虽然不必描写某一场面的一切，已经被描写的局部却必须显示出它与其他部分的关联。正如插图中的华尔华拉的姿态、表情和视线的方向所显示的特定的精神状态，能够突破画面的限制，可以使人联想到虽未出现的有限的画面上的密里席叶夫及其他一样。“真正的人”的其他插图，例如接到前线来信因而喜欢着的安纽泰，对抗着寒冷和疲劳正在挖战壕和想念前方的人的奥丽雅〔注四〕，都显示着她们和其他人物、事件的关联，而不是任何孤立的静止的现象的片段记录，因而这些出现在画面上的局部的事物，寄托着更多的内容。
    插图的独立性和配合作用（或从属性）完全可以统一。只要善于深入理解原作，发挥造形艺术的作用，那么，插图艺术的特长可以充分发挥；如同恩·茹可夫的插图那样，完全可能创造出有高度艺术的优美的作品。
    我们还很缺乏“真正的人”这样优美的插图，群众却期待这样优美的插图及时出现。问题在于画家是不是重视这一工作，是不是更加努力，争取那些创造性地完成这一工作任务的必要条件。
    〔注一〕本文有括号未注明出处的字句，都引自小说“故乡”。
    〔注二〕描绘的是一个长了长胡子的老年人的头像。运用光线的法则近似林布兰的法则，重要部分（眼睛）显得特别鲜明。眼睛的神气显出愤懑，似乎正在敌视着某种存在于画面之外的和他对立的某种东西。
    〔注三〕受伤的飞行员，在雪地里爬行了十八个昼夜，用他超人的毅力，克服了死的威胁，回到祖国的怀抱。
    〔注四〕前者是书中另一英雄坦克手葛伏兹杰夫的爱人，后者是小说主角密里席叶夫的爱人，都是正在成长中的英雄，真正的人。
