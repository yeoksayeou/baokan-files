(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st) News: Japan's new Diet, in which no single party holds a majority of seats after the election, began its 75-day session on the 18th. The results of the elections for Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the new Diet have left Yoshida's Liberal Party in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the Diet. Although Yoshida barely managed to be elected as the new Prime Minister on the 19th with less than a majority of votes, and formed a cabinet again, the conspiracy of the American and Japanese monopoly capital groups to organize a stable "united conservative regime" in order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism has failed due to the increasingly obvious contradictions within the reactionary groups.

After the opening of the new Diet, the election of the Speakers and Vice-Speakers of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors was held on the 18th and 19th. Given the importance of the position of the Speaker of the Diet, Yoshida formally requested a meeting with Mamoru Shigemitsu, the president of the Progressive Party and a Class A war criminal, two days before the Diet session, but the meeting failed to take place due to the failure to coordinate on the issue of dividing the spoils. As a result, in the election of the Speaker, the Progressive Party, with the support of the Hatoyama Liberal Party and the right-wing Socialist Party, won the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the position of Vice-Speaker was also won by the opposition left-wing Socialist Party. The Ryokufukai won the position of Speaker of the House of Councillors, and the position of Vice-Speaker of the House of Councillors was the only one of the four positions of Speaker and Vice-Speaker in both houses of the new Diet obtained by Yoshida's Liberal Party. At the same time, Yoshida's Liberal Party is also in an absolute minority in the eighteen standing committees of the Diet that handle routine affairs.

Due to the differences of opinion among the bourgeois opposition parties in the Diet, Yoshida was elected in the second round of voting with 204 votes when the House of Representatives elected the new Prime Minister on the 19th. This number of votes was more than thirty votes short of a majority in the House of Representatives. The House of Councillors also passed the formation of a cabinet by Yoshida on the same day. Ichiro Kiyose, Secretary-General of the Progressive Party, pointed out: "Yoshida was appointed as the new Prime Minister not by a majority vote, but by the abstention of the left and right-wing Socialist Parties, which played a major role in passing the no-confidence motion against his fourth cabinet." Eisaku Sato, Secretary-General of Yoshida's Liberal Party, admitted: "It is meaningless to organize a cabinet in an opposing Diet that the government cannot confidently control."

The result of the election of the Speakers of the two houses further confirmed the more fragile position of the new Yoshida cabinet and the more turbulent situation in Japan. Kyodo News Agency said: This situation where "the ruling party occupies the executive branch and the opposition party occupies the legislative branch" is "a unique political form unprecedented in constitutional history." In this way, "the Diet will not be able to function smoothly, and the political situation will become increasingly unstable." The English-language "Japan Times" also warned that "the political outlook is very bleak."

Yoshida's increasingly isolated position and the increasingly unstable trend of the political situation have caused serious concern among American and Japanese monopoly capital groups. Kyodo News Agency reported that Tokyo "economic figures" are urging "the Yoshida faction of the Liberal Party, the Hatoyama faction, and the Progressive Party must abandon all previous grievances and reorganize a coalition of conservative parties to work together to stabilize the political situation." After being elected as "the head of the cabinet" on the 19th, Yoshida immediately held a secret meeting with Mamoru Shigemitsu, the president of the Progressive Party, on the morning of the 20th. Kyodo News Agency revealed that Yoshida "asked the Progressive Party to participate in his planned cabinet. If Yoshida cannot get the Progressive Party into the coalition government, he will try to obtain indirect support 'outside the cabinet' or reach some kind of 'policy understanding' with the Progressive Party." However, in the face of the soaring emotions of the Japanese people against Yoshida's return to power, the internal divisions and contradictions of the reactionary groups are becoming increasingly acute. Due to this situation, the conspiracy of the American and Japanese reactionaries to organize a "united conservative regime" has failed. Although Mamoru Shigemitsu "hinted that a coalition of conservative parties might eventually be formed when the time is ripe in the future" during his meeting with Yoshida, he refused Yoshida's request to participate in his cabinet and "remains in the opposition party in the new Diet" in order to continue to force Yoshida's Liberal Party to make concessions. In this situation, according to Kyodo News Agency, "few people in the Tokyo 'economic circles' believe that the political situation will stabilize." They pessimistically admit that "this reality cannot be reversed." Therefore, their "worries are gradually deepening."

### 美日反动派组织“联合保守政权”的阴谋失败  日本反动集团内部意见分歧争权夺利的矛盾日益尖锐

    美日反动派组织“联合保守政权”的阴谋失败
    日本反动集团内部意见分歧争权夺利的矛盾日益尖锐
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：大选后没有一个政党占有过半数议席的日本新国会，已从十八日起开始了为期七十五天的会议。新国会议长和副议长的选举结果，已使吉田自由党在国会中陷于空前孤立的地位。吉田虽然在十九日勉强以不足半数票当选为新首相再度组阁，但由于反动集团内部越来越表面化的矛盾，美日垄断资本集团为了加紧复活日本军国主义而想组织稳定的“联合保守政权”的阴谋已归失败。
    新国会开幕后首先在十八、十九两日选举众院和参院的议长和副议长。鉴于国会议长职位的重要，吉田曾在国会开会前两天正式要求和改进党总裁、甲级战犯重光葵举行会谈，但由于在分赃问题上无法协调，会谈未能举行。结果，在议长的选举中，改进党在鸠山自由党、右派社会党的支持下取得了众院议长职，副议长职也由在野党左派社会党所取得。绿风会取得了参院议长职，参院副议长职是吉田自由党在新国会两院正副议长四个职位中取得的唯一的职位。同时，在国会处理经常事务的十八个常设委员会中，吉田自由党也都处于绝对少数的地位。
    由于国会中各资产阶级在野党的意见分歧，众院十九日在选举新首相组阁时，吉田在第二次投票中以二百零四票当选。这个票数不足众院过半数达三十票之多。参院也在同一天通过由吉田组阁。改进党干事长清濑一郎指出：“吉田被任命为新首相不是靠多数票，而是靠在通过对他的第四次内阁的不信任案时曾起主要作用的左派和右派社会党弃权。”吉田自由党的干事长佐藤荣作承认：“在政府未能自信顺利控制的对立的国会中，组织内阁是没有什么意义的。”
    两院议长选举的结果，进一步确定了吉田新内阁更加脆弱的地位和日本政局将要更加动荡的局面。共同社说：这种“执政党占领行政，在野党占据立法”的情况，“是宪政史上没有前例的特异的政治形态”。这样，“国会将不能顺利进行工作，政局将越来越不稳定了。”英文的“日本时报”也警告说：“政治的前景非常不妙”。
    吉田地位的更加孤立和政局越来越不稳定的趋势，已引起美日垄断资本集团的严重忧虑。共同社报道：东京“经济界人士”正在督促“自由党的吉田派和鸠山派及改进党这三个保守政党必须抛弃以前的一切嫌怨，重新组成保守政党的联盟，共同努力以谋政治局势的稳定”。吉田在十九日当选“组阁首长”之后，马上就在二十日早晨和改进党总裁重光葵举行密谈。共同社透露：吉田在密谈中“要求改进党参加他计划中的内阁。如果吉田不能使改进党进入联合政府，他就要设法取得‘内阁外’的间接支持，或者和改进党达成某种‘政策上的谅解’”。但是，在日本人民反对吉田重新上台的激昂情绪面前，反动集团内部意见分歧、争权夺利的矛盾日益尖锐。由于这种情况，美日反动派组织“联合保守政权”的阴谋已经失败。重光葵在与吉田会谈时虽然一方面“暗示等到将来时机成熟可能终将组成保守派的联盟”，但另一方面又拒绝吉田提出的参加他的内阁的要求，“仍在新的国会中保持反对党的地位”，以继续迫使吉田自由党让步。在这种情形之下，据共同社透露：东京“经济界人士”“很少有人认为政治局势会有稳定下来的希望”。他们悲观地承认：这种“现实形势是不能扭转的”。因此，他们的“这种忧虑正逐渐深刻起来”。
