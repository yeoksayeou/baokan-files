Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th: Korean workers, women, and youth organizations have issued statements protesting the U.S. Air Force's continued bombing of irrigation facilities in the rear of Korea and the bloody atrocities of massacring innocent farmers.

    The Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions protested: The entire workers, technicians, and staff members of the Republic express their utmost indignation at the enemy's recent continuous indiscriminate bombing of peaceful irrigation facilities in Korea. We are determined to further strengthen our unity around the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the leader, and with the support and solidarity of the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet people, to fight more resolutely to stop the enemy's atrocities.
    The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union protested: The U.S. imperialists' perpetration of these atrocities is directly related to the enemy's attempt to obstruct the armistice negotiations. In the name of the Korean mothers and children who have been sacrificed in the enemy's atrocities, we firmly protest and denounce the enemy's atrocities.
    The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League protested: The entire youth of the Republic, together with all the people, will not relax their vigilance against the enemy for a moment. We will defend the honor of our motherland with a more resolute struggle. Together with the just and kind youth of the world, we severely protest and condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism. We believe that the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for these provocative crimes.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th: On the 22nd, the U.S. Air Force bombed the Limwon Reservoir in Daedong County, South Pyongan Province. U.S. planes dropped more than 40 bombs, destroying dozens of meters of the reservoir dam, and a large amount of irrigation water poured out of the reservoir, flooding many farmlands.
    Since May 13th, the U.S. aggressors have systematically destroyed the Gyeonryong, Jamo, and Limwon reservoirs in South Pyongan Province, frantically attempting to destroy agricultural production in the area and massacre farmers in the area. Thanks to the timely emergency measures taken by the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government to vigorously rescue disaster areas and provide relief to disaster victims, the disaster has been greatly mitigated. At present, the farmers in the South Pyongan Province region are, under the leadership of the Party and the government and with the assistance of all the people, engaged in the struggle to restore the disaster area and resume grain production.

    朝鲜各人民团体抗议美空军轰炸灌溉设施
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜工人、妇女、青年团体分别发表声明，抗议美国空军连续轰炸朝鲜后方灌溉设施、屠杀无辜农民的血腥暴行。
    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会抗议说：共和国全体工人、技术人员和职员，对于敌人最近连续滥炸朝鲜和平的灌溉设施的暴行，表示万分愤怒。我们决心进一步巩固地团结在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和领袖的周围，在以苏联人民为首的国际民主阵营的支持和声援之下，为制止敌人的暴行而更加顽强地斗争。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会抗议说：美帝国主义制造这些暴行，和敌人阻挠停战谈判的企图有直接的联系。我们朝鲜妇女用牺牲在敌人暴行之下的朝鲜母亲们和儿童们的名义，坚决抗议和痛斥敌人的暴行。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会抗议说：共和国的全体青年和全体人民一起，片刻也不放松对敌人的警惕。我们将以更加坚强的斗争保卫祖国的荣誉。我们和全世界正义善良的青年一起，严重抗议和斥责美帝国主义的罪行。我们认为：美国政府对于这种挑衅性的罪行必须负全部责任。
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】美国空军在二十二日又轰炸了朝鲜平安南道大同郡的林原贮水池。美机投弹四十多颗，贮水池堤坝被炸毁数十公尺，大量灌溉用水从池内涌出，有不少农田浸了水。
    美国侵略者从五月十三日以来，已经有计划地破坏了平安南道的见龙、慈母、林原三个贮水池，疯狂地企图破坏这个地区的农业生产，屠杀这个地区的农民。由于朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府及时地采取了紧急措施，大力抢救灾区，救济灾民，灾情大大减轻。现在，平安南道地区的农民正在党和政府的领导下以及全体人民的协助下，进行着恢复灾区和重新生产食粮的斗争。
