Geological Department Team 429 Completes Exploration Report of Daye Mining Area
Providing Rich Design Data for New Giant Steel Plant

[This newspaper reports] The entire staff of Team 429 of the Central Geological Department, with incomparable excitement, presented to the people of the whole country on May 15th their first work achievement of the year – the geological exploration report of the Daye Tieshan (Iron Mountain) Mining Area. This report provides rich design data for China's new giant steel factory, and it will promote the rapid service of Daye Tieshan's rich resources to our country's industrial construction.

Starting in May of last year, Team 429, focusing on geological work, launched large-scale geological, drilling, geophysical prospecting, surveying, testing, and trenching work in Daye Tieshan. This report is the comprehensive result of these efforts. In nine chapters, totaling more than 57,000 words, 258 various geological maps, 96 types of tables, and two appendices, it meticulously records and analyzes the geological structure of Tieshan and its relationship with mineral deposits, describes the types of mineral deposits, the shapes of ore bodies, and the characteristics of minerals, investigates and tallies mining technical indicators, calculates average grades and reserves, derives different grades of ore quantities, points out the direction of future exploration, and also includes hydrological data, enabling people to have a comprehensive understanding of the Tieshan mining area. Daye Tieshan has been mined since 1891, for more than sixty years, and there has never been an exploration report with such complete materials and such a large work scale. In the past, people only knew that Tieshan had abundant resources, but did not understand the specific situation. This time, however, the reserves of the entire area have been specifically calculated to be sufficient to supply the iron ore required for the giant steel factories that China will build, and a model of the ore distribution can be made based on the drawn geological map, making it clear at a glance.

The reason why these tasks can be completed quickly is because, under the call to build the motherland and under the direct leadership of the Party, they can actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and overcome difficulties. Drilling workers are using steel grit instead of diamond grit, and recently they are learning the "mud washing well method" to avoid or reduce the use of casings. Geological workers criticized the old geological theories, learned the Soviet Union's attitude of combining theory with practice, replaced the past arithmetic average method with the weighted average method when calculating grades, carefully distinguished between reserve grades when calculating reserves, replaced the past impractical calculation methods with parallel section method and contour line method, and made technical mining indicators based on advanced Soviet experience. Assembly line operations were also implemented in testing and geological work. These advanced experiences have greatly improved their work quality and labor efficiency. According to geological workers, after mastering the materials, it used to take at least half a year to organize such an exploration report indoors, but now it only takes more than a month, including the time for preliminary review and repeated correction.

Geological Department Team 429 is conducting such a large-scale exploration work for the first time, and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was relatively late, so there are still some shortcomings in the work. For example, the coordination between geological work and drilling is not enough, resulting in a low core recovery rate, incomplete collection of groundwater hydrological data, and some reserve gradings have not yet reached the national standards. All of these have more or less affected the content of this report to a certain extent.

    地质部四二九队完成大冶矿区勘探报告
    为新建巨型钢铁厂提供了丰富设计资料
    【本报讯】中央地质部四二九队全体工作人员怀着无比兴奋的心情，在五月十五日向全国人民献出了他们一年来的第一个工作成果——大冶铁山矿区的地质勘探报告。这个报告为我国新建巨型钢铁工厂提供了丰富的设计资料，它将促使大冶铁山的富饶资源迅速地为我国工业建设服务。
    四二九队从去年五月开始就以地质工作为中心，在大冶铁山展开了大规模的地质、钻探、物探、测量、化验与槽探工作。这个报告便是这些工作的综合成果。它以九篇十四章、五万七千多字、二百五十八幅各种地质图、九十六种表格、两个附件，详尽地记录和分析了铁山地质构造及其与矿藏的关系，说明了矿藏类型、矿体形状与矿物特征，调查与统计了开采技术指数，计算出了平均品位与储量，得出了不同等级的矿量，指出了今后勘探方向，并且还附有水文资料，使人们对铁山矿区能够全面了解。大冶铁山从一八九一年开采以来，到现在已有六十多年，还不曾有过一份像这样材料比较齐全、工作规模巨大的勘探报告。过去人们只知铁山资源丰富，对具体情况并不了解，这次却具体计算出了全区储量可以充分供应我国将建设的巨型钢铁工厂所需的铁矿，并且根据所绘的地质图便可作出矿藏分布情况的模型，使人一目了然。
    这些工作所以能迅速完成，是因为他们在建设祖国的号召下与党的直接领导下，能积极学习苏联先进经验，克服困难。钻探工人们以钢砂代替金钢砂，最近又在学习“泥浆洗井法”，以求不用或少用套管。地质工作者批判了旧的地质理论，学习苏联理论与实际结合的工作态度，在计算品位时以加权平均法代替过去的算术平均法，在计算储量时缜密地分别储量等级，以平行断面法和等深线法代替过去不切合实际的计算方法，并且根据苏联先进经验作出了技术开采指数。在化验与地质工作方面，也实行了流水作业。这些先进经验，都使他们的工作质量与劳动效率大大提高。据地质工作者谈，掌握材料后，在室内整理这样一份勘探报告，过去最少也得半年，而现在只花了一个多月时间，还包括初步审查与反复校正的时间在内。
    地质部四二九队是第一次进行这样大规模的勘探工作，加以学习苏联先进经验又比较晚，工作中还有若干缺点。如地质工作与钻探配合不够，以致岩心采取率不高，地下水文资料收集的不齐全，在储量分级上有的也还未达到国家规定标准。这些都或多或少地使这个报告的内容受到了一定的影响。
