A Letter to Sun Wenzhi's Mother
Sun Wenzhi - Loving Mother:

    In the April 5th "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue" of the People's Daily, I read the letter you wrote to Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, to donate money to Korean orphans. To save the lives of Korean children, you donated 12 million yuan, which you and your husband had saved through frugality over years of work in education. This noble maternal love has warmed the hearts of every Korean person, every Korean mother and child, and has deeply moved me and every soldier fighting for peace and for the children of Korea.

    Mother, I am now a young soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteers, but I spent my childhood in days of deep suffering. I lost my mother before I was three years old; when I was thirteen, the Japanese devils killed my father. Our family was left with only me, a young seedling, and the days were so dark and miserable! At that time, people who sympathized with my family's tragic fate adopted me into a rear-area children's home, where I spent many years with nearly five hundred other companions who had suffered the same fate as me. The sound of the liberation of the motherland brought us new hope, and the truly happy life of Chinese children began. However, even more tragic experiences than my childhood befell the children of Korea, beginning on June 25, 1950. The American imperialists, at any political and moral cost, poured large quantities of shells, bombs, and napalm bombs onto the peaceful land of Korea, creating an unprecedented catastrophe in human history.

    In October 1950, I and my comrades crossed the Yalu River and fought on the unyielding land of Korea. We chased the enemy all the way from the Yalu River to the south bank of the Han River, and later we were interspersed and repeatedly traveled in the east, central, and western lines, the front lines and the rear. We have traveled almost everywhere on the Korean highways, railways, main roads, trails, mountains and plains north of the Han River, cities and villages. Here, we have never seen a complete town or village. Many pine trees on the mountains have been burned to death by American napalm bombs; on the highway, you can encounter one crater after another everywhere. On this land ravaged by American imperialism, I don't know how many parents have lost their children, how many children have lost their mothers, how many families have been destroyed by the enemy! Dear Mother, have you heard the story of infants lying on the corpses of their mothers, bleeding profusely, crying for milk? Have you heard of the tragic scene of a mother carrying a headless child, fleeing from the smoke and fire after being bombed by enemy planes? These all happened in our neighboring country, Korea, and have been recorded on the American war criminals' bill of slaughtering humanity.

    No matter how brutal and vicious the enemy is, the faces of the heroic Korean people have never shown any surrender or frustration, and they are fighting for their country and for their children. Those children who have had their homes destroyed and their relatives taken away, are not only being taken in and raised by the Korean People's Government as much as possible, but are also being taken in and raised by the ordinary people of Korea. Choi Gui-nyeo, a 25-year-old young woman, is a glorious Labor Party member who lives in Okdong-ri, Pyonggang County, Gangwon Province. Her husband said to her when he joined the army: "See you at the final victory. Since you don't have the burden of children yet, you should do more work than others, so that you deserve to be a wife of a People's Army soldier and a member of the Labor Party." She indeed did not fail her husband's expectations. She played an active leading role in patriotic production increases, in supporting the front lines, and in carrying out all the tasks of the Party and the government. When she heard the cries of orphans, it aroused her noble maternal love, making her feel an inescapable responsibility, so she decided to raise these children who had no parents. Now she has adopted eight Korean orphans, and the children have grown up to be fair and chubby, four of whom are of school age and have been sent to people's schools to study. As soon as the children come back from school, they call out: "Mom, I'm back." "Mom, I want to eat." Choi Gui-nyeo feeds them the food she made with her own hands and clothes them with the clothes she made with her own hands. Whenever she sees the children singing "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" to go to school or play games in an innocent and lively manner, she feels infinite comfort and honor. Dear Mother, in a peaceful environment, it would probably be difficult enough for a young woman with no worries about food and clothing to raise eight children, but in wartime Korea, every grain, every thread, needs to be earned by Choi Gui-nyeo herself through labor, risking the threat of enemy planes! But all difficulties were overcome by Choi Gui-nyeo's strong and unyielding struggle. Under her influence, twelve women in this village have adopted thirty-two such orphans.

    Dear Mother, let me tell you more about the Korean children you care about. They really make people feel so lovely! In winter, the earth is covered with snow, and everything is frozen hard. To ensure the timely supply of materials, the Chinese People's Volunteers transportation units continue to drive their cars on the snowy roads. This aroused great attention from the children along the way. So they imitated the appearance of cars and made many sleds, learning the posture of the Chinese People's Volunteers drivers on the small mountain paths behind the houses, sliding down one after another. They are not afraid of the cold, nor do they care about the danger, practicing so earnestly again and again. Obviously, the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers have deeply touched their young minds, and they are determined to learn from the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    A group of children around our garrison is equally adorable. They are often seen making a model of an American "B-29" aircraft out of sorghum stalks, with a larger child holding it in the air, making repeated diving bombing gestures, while the rest of the children are scattered around, throwing stones at the enemy plane, and making "Tong, tong, tong..." anti-aircraft gun sounds in their mouths. When they completely smash the enemy plane, they burst into laughter. Often we also watch with great interest and laugh with them. At this time, the children gather around us, shouting in unison: "Ji Wen Gun, Gao Sha Pao, Chao Si Mi Da!" (Chinese People's Volunteers, anti-aircraft gun, top-notch!) "Mi Guo Pi Heng Ji, Ma Ni Chu Ke, Cao Wa!" (It would be great to shoot down more American planes!) ...

    Dear Mother, aren't these children just as innocent and pure, with the same clear love and hate, as the children in front of you and the motherland? But the children of the motherland can wear fancy clothes, eat little candies, and play happily with dolls, while the equally lovely Korean children continue to suffer from the serious threat of war. American planes and artillery have already taken the lives of many children's parents and the children themselves, and are still continuing to commit the same atrocities. Therefore, I think that the mothers of the motherland who love peace and love children should shine more of the great glory of maternal love on the land of Korea to warm the little hearts of these orphaned lives left behind by heroic parents. Mother, we must resolutely fight to the end to defend the safety and happiness of the motherland and our children, and we must resolutely fight to the end to save Korean mothers and children from the disasters of war!

### 写给孙文芝妈妈的一封信

    写给孙文芝妈妈的一封信孙文芝——慈爱的妈妈：
    在四月五日人民日报的“抗美援朝专刊”上，我读了你为了捐款给朝鲜孤儿写给中国人民抗美援朝总会郭沫若主席的信。你为了拯救朝鲜孩子的生命，把你和你的丈夫在长期从事教育工作中，省吃俭用积累起来的一千二百万元捐献出来。这种崇高的母爱，温暖了每个朝鲜人民，每个朝鲜母亲和孩子的心，也深深地感动了我和每个为和平，为朝鲜的孩子而斗争的战士们。
    妈妈，我现在是志愿军的一个青年战士，但是我的童年却是在灾难深重的日子里度过的。我不满三岁就死了母亲；十三岁那年，日本鬼子又杀死了我的父亲。我们一家只剩下我这一棵幼苗，日子该是多么阴暗凄惨啊！当时，同情我家悲惨遭遇的人，把我收养在一所后方的儿童保育院里，在那里，我和将近五百个和我遭到同样命运的小伙伴们度过了漫长的岁月。祖国解放的炮声，给我们带来了新的希望，中国孩子们的真正幸福的生活开始了。可是，比我童年更悲惨的遭遇，从一九五○年六月二十五日起，又降临在朝鲜孩子们的身上。美帝国主义不惜以任何政治上和道德上的代价，把大量炮弹、炸弹、凝固汽油弹倾泻在朝鲜的和平土地上，造成了人类历史上的空前大浩劫。
    一九五○年十月，我就和我的同志们跨过了鸭绿江，战斗在朝鲜不屈的土地上。我们从鸭绿江边，一直把敌人追击到汉江南岸，后来又在东线、中线和西线，前沿和后方，到处穿插，反复奔走，汉江以北的朝鲜公路、铁道、大路、小径、高山和平地，城市和乡村，我们差不多全走遍了。在这里，我们没有看见过一个完整的城镇和乡村。山岭上的许多松树都被美国的凝固汽油弹烧枯了；在公路上，你到处都可以碰到一个接一个的弹坑。就在这块被美帝国主义蹂躏了的土地上，不知道多少父母失去了孩子，多少孩子失去了母亲，多少家庭被敌人毁灭了啊！亲爱的妈妈，你听说过乳儿伏在鲜血直流的母亲尸体上，哭叫着要吃奶的故事吗？你听说过母亲背着一个没了脑袋的孩子，从被敌机轰炸后的浓烟大火中逃出来的惨景吗？这些都发生在我们的邻邦朝鲜，都已记录在美国战犯屠杀人类的账单上了。
    任凭敌人如何残暴和凶恶，英勇的朝鲜人民的脸上，从来没有流露过一点屈服和沮丧，他们在为祖国、为孩子坚持战斗着。那些被毁灭了家、被夺去了亲人的孩子，不但朝鲜人民政府在尽量收容抚养着他们，就是朝鲜的普通人民也在收容和抚养着他们。二十五岁的青年妇女崔贵女，是个光荣的劳动党员，住在江原道平康郡玉洞里。她的丈夫参军时对她说：“到最后胜利时再见吧。你现在还没有孩子的连累，应该比别人做更多的活，这样才不愧是一个人民军战士的妻子，不愧是一个劳动党的党员。”她的确没有辜负她丈夫的期望。在爱国增产中，在支援前线中，在执行党和政府的一切任务中，她都起了积极带头的作用。当她听到孤儿的哭泣，就唤起了她崇高的母爱，使她感到一种不能推脱的责任，于是她下定决心抚育这些没有爹娘的孩子。现在她已收养了八个朝鲜孤儿，孩子都长得又白又胖，其中四个已到入学年龄，送到人民学校去念书了。孩子一下学回来就叫：“妈妈我回来了。”“妈妈，我要吃饭。”崔贵女就把自己亲手做的饭给他们吃，把自己亲手做的衣服给他们穿。每当她看到孩子们天真活泼地唱着“金日成将军之歌”去上学或做游戏的时候，她就感到无限的慰籍和荣誉。亲爱的妈妈，在和平的环境里，一个吃穿不愁的青年妇女，要抚养八个孩子恐怕就够吃力了吧，可是，在战时的朝鲜，一颗粮，一根线，都需要崔贵女自己冒着敌机的威胁，用劳动去换取呀！可是一切困难都被崔贵女坚强不屈的斗争克服了。就在她的影响之下，这个村里十二个妇女已经收养了三十二个这样的孤儿了。
    亲爱的妈妈，我再说说你所关心的朝鲜的孩子们吧。他们也真使人觉得可爱！冬天，大地一片积雪，到处冻得硬绑绑地。志愿军运输部队，为了保证物资的及时供应，照常开驶着汽车在雪道上飞驶。这引起了沿途孩子们的极大注意。于是他们仿照汽车的样子，做成了许多滑雪车，在房后的山坡小道上，学着志愿军司机开车的姿势，一个接一个地向下溜滑。他们既不怕寒冷，也不顾危险，一次又一次地练习得那样认真。显然，志愿军的英雄行为深深打动了他们小小的心灵，他们在决心学习志愿军哩！
    在我们驻地周围的一群孩子，同样惹人喜爱。常常看到他们用高粱稷做成一架美国“B—二九”飞机的模型，由一个较大的孩子支在上空，作出反复俯冲轰炸的样子，其余的孩子就散布在四周，用石头子向敌机投掷，口里还发出“通，通，通……”的高射炮声。当他们把敌机打得完全粉碎时，就发出一片欢笑声。常常我们也看得津津有味，同他们一起欢笑起来，这时孩子们就围拢在我们的身边，你一嘴我一舌地嚷着：“吉温滚，高杀炮，朝斯米达！”（志愿军，高射炮，顶呱呱！）“米国皮亨机，马尼楚可，操哇！”（把美国飞机多打下来几架才好呢！）……
    亲爱的妈妈，这些孩子不是与你和祖国母亲们跟前的孩子们一样的天真烂漫，一样的爱憎分明吗？但是祖国的孩子，能够穿着花衣裳，吃着小人糖，抱着洋娃娃在愉快地玩着，而同样可爱的朝鲜的孩子，却在继续受着战争的严重的威胁。美国的飞机和大炮已经夺去了不少孩子的父母和孩子自己的生命，现在还在继续制造着同样的暴行。因此，我想热爱和平、热爱孩子的祖国的母亲们，是应该把更多的伟大的母爱的光辉，照射到朝鲜的土地上，来温暖这些英雄父母留下来的孤苦伶仃的生命的小心灵。妈妈，我们要坚决为保卫祖国母亲和孩子们的安全和幸福而战斗到底，我们要坚决为拯救朝鲜母亲和孩子们摆脱战争灾难而战斗到底！
