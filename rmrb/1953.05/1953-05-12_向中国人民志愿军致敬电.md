To Commander Peng Dehuai and all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has concluded victoriously. All of us delegates extend our highest respect to you with boundless enthusiasm.
    Dear Comrades, thanks to your heroic battles, you have struck a blow against the arrogant aggressive schemes of American imperialism, safeguarded the security of the motherland, and enabled our great motherland to complete the arduous task of economic recovery during the Resist-America-Aid-Korea Movement, entering a new period of planned economic construction.
    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is being held at this time to mobilize the working class across the country to complete the great historical task of the construction period with redoubled efforts.
    Dear Comrades, your heroic battles constantly inspire us. We must better learn from your noble patriotism and internationalism, deeply carry out patriotic labor emulation drives, and continuously improve labor productivity to ensure the completion and strive to exceed various targets of the national construction plan. The workers of the whole country must struggle with creative labor to enhance the defense and economic strength of our great motherland.

    All Delegates of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    May 11, 1953
