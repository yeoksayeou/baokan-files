Following the publication of the article "Anshan 'Worker Life' Newspaper Encountered Serious Obstruction from Bureaucrats in Carrying Out Criticism" in the People's Daily on February 6, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau immediately sent people to Anshan to investigate and handle the matter.

In the process of handling the matter, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee attached great importance to the criticism from the People's Daily from the very beginning. After the critical article was published, the Municipal Party Committee immediately held a meeting to study and discuss it; the criticized individuals also unanimously expressed their sincere acceptance of the criticism from the People's Daily and made preliminary self-criticisms. On February 18, Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, and Shen Dongli, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, also made public self-criticisms at a city-wide meeting of Party member cadres. Sha Youishi, Director of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Ma Chengde, Director of the Steelmaking Plant, also made several public self-criticisms at cadre meetings in their respective departments (because the work schedule was divided into three shifts, three meetings were required). In order to combine this criticism with a broad solicitation of opinions and criticisms from cadres and the masses on the leadership, the Municipal Party Committee divided the city's organs and factories into twenty-two groups to conduct discussions. During the discussions, the masses were very enthusiastic, and they put forward many useful criticisms and opinions to the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal People's Government, the Iron and Steel Company, and the departmental leading cadres, and they exposed many bad people and bad deeds, which played a great role in promoting the improvement of Anshan's work. On this basis, the mass struggle against bureaucracy was launched in depth throughout the city in a planned and led manner. After criticism and self-criticism formed a mass movement, the criticized individuals, under the personal guidance and assistance of Comrade Zhang Mingyuan, Third Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, made more profound self-criticisms; they also sent written self-criticisms to the People's Daily one after another. The self-criticisms they made were generally more profound and sincere, especially the self-criticism made by Comrade Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, was the most profound. (Comrade Han Tianshi's self-criticism was published in the People's Daily on March 12.) Comrade Han Tianshi's work in Anshan was very successful, and he took a warm welcome attitude towards the criticism of the People's Daily, and he carried out self-examination with extreme humility, sincerity and courage, and thus drove and influenced other comrades to quickly make self-criticisms. Comrade Han Tianshi's spirit of daring to conduct self-criticism further proved that he was a cadre of excellent quality. His prestige among the masses was not affected by this. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau also pointed out in its handling decision: Comrade Han Tianshi recognized the seriousness of the problem from the beginning, and his self-criticism was relatively profound and his attitude was very sincere, and he asked for punishment himself, expressing his determination to correct his mistakes. Therefore, in addition to making a self-criticism, no punishment should be given.

The mistakes made by other criticized individuals, such as Sha Youishi, Director of the Transportation Department of the Iron and Steel Company, Ma Chengde, Director of the Steelmaking Plant, and Shen Dongli, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee, have been decided by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and approved by the Northeast Discipline Inspection Committee. The decision pointed out that Sha Youishi's mistake of suppressing democracy and resisting criticism was extremely serious. This kind of mistake of his was consistent. Although he made a self-criticism and made changes after being criticized by the People's Daily, his understanding was still not profound enough, and he sometimes revealed dissatisfaction. At the same time, he has occurred three serious accidents of deaths and injuries in transportation work in January and February this year, which also shows that Comrade Sha Youishi's bureaucratic negligence of safety work is very serious. In order to educate Comrade Sha Youishi, it was decided to give him a public warning within the Party and recommend that he be given a demerit in administration. Ma Chengde's mistake of suppressing democracy and resisting the criticism of worker correspondent Cao Yongkui in the newspaper was indeed serious and should be punished; however, during the democratic remedial lesson, he had already taken the initiative to make a self-criticism on this and formally admitted his mistake to Comrade Cao Yongkui. After being criticized by the People's Daily, he further realized the seriousness of his mistake, took the initiative to solicit opinions from employees, and made oral and written self-criticisms to the Party Committee, the newspaper, and the employees. His attitude was sincere, and he expressed his determination to correct his mistakes; therefore, he can be exempted from punishment. Comrade Shen Dongli wrote a letter to the newspaper to request correction of the criticism of Su Dong, his wife, in the "three-anti" movement in order to defend Su Dong's mistake. Comrade Shen Dongli's mistake was also serious. As he himself reviewed, "He left the Party's position and his own job, violating the CCP Central Committee's 'Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications'. The main reason is that ideologically, he did not fully understand the importance of criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, and still retained the tail of petty-bourgeois individualism. Therefore, when encountering problems related to individuals, he often planned for individuals and made mistakes." At the beginning of the criticism from the People's Daily, Comrade Shen Dongli's understanding of his mistakes was not profound enough, but after being educated by the Party, he quickly realized the seriousness of his mistakes, took the initiative to solicit opinions from comrades, and made a self-criticism to the Municipal Party Committee, and published it publicly in the "Worker Life" newspaper. His attitude was sincere, and he expressed his determination to correct his mistakes; therefore, he can be exempted from punishment. Comrade Fan Wencai, President of the Municipal People's Court, because his more serious mistake was not attacking the critic, but there were many dereliction of duty problems in his work. Therefore, it was decided that the Municipal Party Committee would send people to inspect the work of the court and handle it together. Comrade Hu Renshou, the former Director of the Political Department of the Housing Construction Office of the Iron and Steel Company, because he was transferred from other positions to help with the work temporarily, has returned to his original work position and will be handled by the Party Committee of his affiliated agency.

In addition, personnel related to this incident, such as former Municipal Party Committee Secretary Yang Chunmao and Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Minister Liu Yiyun, also voluntarily wrote written self-criticisms to the People's Daily, expressing their sincere acceptance of the criticism from the People's Daily and their determination to correct their mistakes in future work.

Through the criticism of this incident by the People's Daily and the serious handling by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Northeast Bureau and the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, not only did the above-mentioned criticized individuals should correctly treat newspaper criticism and mass criticism, thoroughly establish the mass viewpoint and the thinking of relying on the working class, but also educated and encouraged the broad masses of Anshan. They were moved after seeing the criticism in the newspaper and said: "Only the Communist Party can do this," "This never happened in the old society," "The Communist Party is not afraid of criticism and is not afraid to expose shortcomings," "Chairman Mao leads well, it's great." There are many such reflections. Editorial departments of newspapers in various places, especially industrial and mining newspapers, such as "Fengfeng Worker" newspaper, "New Hegang" newspaper, and more than 20 other newspapers, wrote to the People's Daily, believing that this was a great support and encouragement to them. This has a positive effect on strengthening criticism and self-criticism in newspapers in industrial and mining areas and promoting national industrial production.

    中共中央东北局、鞍山市委纪律检查委员会
    严肃检查处理“工人生活”报批评受阻的情况
    从二月六日人民日报刊登“鞍山‘工人生活’报在开展批评中遭遇到官僚主义者的严重阻碍”一文后，东北局纪律检查委员会即派人前去鞍山检查处理。
    在处理过程中，鞍山市委对人民日报的批评一开始就是极为重视的。当批评文章发表后市委立即开会进行了研究讨论；被批评者也一致表示诚恳接受人民日报的批评，并作了初步检讨。二月十八日，鞍山市委书记韩天石、组织部副部长申东黎又在市委召开的全市党员干部大会上作了公开检讨。鞍山钢铁公司运输部主任沙友石、炼钢厂厂长马成德也分别在各该部门干部会上一连作了数次（因为工作时间分三班，需要分三次召开）公开检讨。市委为结合这次的批评广泛地征求干部群众对领导上的意见和批评，更在市内各机关厂矿划分二十二个小组，分组进行讨论。在讨论中，群众情绪都很热烈，给市委、市人民政府、钢铁公司的领导上，以及部门的领导干部提出不少有益的批评和意见，并揭发了不少坏人坏事，对改进鞍山的工作起了很大推动作用。在这个基础上，反对官僚主义的群众性的斗争，即在全市范围内有领导有计划地深入展开。批评和自我批评形成群众性的运动后，被批评者在东北局第三副书记张明远同志亲自指示和帮助下，更进一步作了深刻的检讨；他们并以书面检讨先后寄给人民日报。他们所作的检讨一般都比较深刻和诚恳，其中尤以市委书记韩天石同志的检讨最为深刻。（韩天石同志的检讨，已在三月十二日人民日报发表）韩天石同志在鞍山的工作是很有成绩的，他对人民日报的批评采取了热烈欢迎的态度，并极其虚心、诚恳和勇敢地进行了自我检查，并从而带动和影响其他的同志迅速作了检讨。韩天石同志这种勇于进行自我批评的精神，更证明他是一个品质优良的干部。他在群众中的威信，并没有因此而受到影响。东北局纪律检查委员会在处理决定中，也曾指出：韩天石同志一开始即认识到问题的严重性，检讨也比较深刻，态度也很诚恳，并自请处分，表示了改正错误的决心。因之除作检讨外，可不给处分。
    其他被批评者，如钢铁公司运输部主任沙友石、炼钢厂厂长马成德、市委组织部副部长申东黎等同志所犯错误，已由鞍山市委纪律检查委员会作出处分决定，并经东北纪律检查委员会批准。在处分决定中指出：沙友石同志压制民主抗拒批评的错误是极为严重的。他这种错误是带有一贯性的。经人民日报批评后，他虽作了检讨，有了改变，但在认识上仍然不够深刻，有时还流露着不满情绪。同时他在今年一、二月份的运输工作中，还先后发生了三次死伤的严重事故，这也说明沙友石同志忽视保安工作的官僚主义很严重。为教育沙友石同志，决定党内给予当众警告处分，并建议行政上给予记过处分。马成德同志压制民主、抗拒工人通讯员曹永魁在报纸上批评的错误，确实是严重的，应该给以处分；但在民主补课时，他已对此主动作了检讨，正式向曹永魁同志承认了错误。经人民日报批评后，他更进一步认识了自己错误的严重性，主动征求职工意见，向党委、报社及职工作了口头的和书面的检讨。他的态度诚恳，表示决心改正错误；因此，可以免予处分。申东黎同志在“三反”运动中，为辩护其妻子苏东同志的错误，写信给报社，要求更正对苏东的批评。申东黎同志这一错误也是严重的。正如他自己所检讨的，“是离开了党的立场与自己的工作岗位，违反了中共中央‘关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定’。其主要原因是由于思想上对批评与自我批评，尤其是自下而上的批评的重要性认识不足，还保留着小资产阶级的个人主义的尾巴。因此遇到与个人有关的问题，就常为个人打算，而犯了错误。”在人民日报批评之初，申东黎同志对自己的错误在认识上并不够深刻，但经过党的教育，即很快认识到错误的严重性，主动征求同志们的意见，并向市委作了检讨，并在“工人生活”报公开发表。他的态度诚恳，表示决心改正错误；因此，可以不给处分。市人民法院院长范文采同志，因其更严重的错误还不是打击批评者，而是在工作中有许多失职的问题。因之决定由市委派人检查法院工作后，一并处理。前钢铁公司住宅工程处政治处主任胡仁寿同志，因他是其他岗位调来临时帮助工作的，已回原工作岗位，将由其所属机关党委负责处理。
    另外，和这一事件有关的人员，如前任市委书记杨春茂、市委宣传部长刘异云等同志，也都自动给人民日报写了书面检讨，表示诚恳接受人民日报的批评，在今后工作中决心改正错误。
    通过人民日报对这一事件的批评，和东北局、鞍山市委纪律检查委员会的严肃处理，不仅教育了上述被批评者本人应该正确地对待报纸批评和群众批评，彻底树立群众观点和依靠工人阶级的思想，并且教育和鼓舞了鞍山市的广大群众。他们看到报纸的批评后曾感动地说：“只有共产党才能这样做”、“旧社会绝对没有这事”、“共产党不怕批评，不怕暴露缺点”、“毛主席领导得好，太伟大了。”这种反映很多。各地报纸特别是工矿报纸，如“峰峰工人”报、“新鹤岗”报等二十多家报纸编辑部都给人民日报写信，认为这对他们是很大的支持和鼓舞。这对于加强工矿地区报纸的批评和自我批评、推动国家工业生产是有积极作用的。
