Xinhua News Agency, May 11th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement protesting the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into our country's airspace and the killing and wounding of our people. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On May 10th and 11th, 1953, the U.S. invading air force in Korea, with a total of twenty-five aircraft of F-86, F-84, B-29, and B-26 types, intruded into the airspace of Lagu Shao and Andong in Northeast China three times, scattered leaflets, and carried out bombing and strafing, dropping more than fifty bombs, resulting in the death and injury of more than two hundred and fifty Chinese residents. This is a more serious provocative action by the U.S. government after its repeated crimes of intruding into Chinese airspace and killing and wounding Chinese people. The entire Chinese people are extremely angry at this act of aggression by the U.S. government. Therefore, I am authorized to lodge a strong protest with the U.S. government.

The people of the world yearn for a ceasefire in Korea. In order to resolve the issue of all prisoners of war and to promote a ceasefire in Korea, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued statements on March 30th and March 31st, 1953, respectively, putting forward fair and reasonable proposals. As a result of this proposal, the long-interrupted Korean armistice negotiations were able to resume. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army armistice negotiation delegations have successively put forward two constructive plans for resolving the repatriation of all prisoners of war at the armistice negotiation conference. Now, just as the Korean armistice negotiations are underway, the U.S. government has dispatched its invading air force in Korea to intrude into Chinese airspace and kill and wound Chinese people. Obviously, this provocative action by the U.S. government is an attempt to influence the Korean armistice negotiations and challenge the desire of the people of the world for a ceasefire in Korea. However, it can be asserted that this attempt by the U.S. government is bound to fail. The firm will of the Chinese and Korean peoples to fight for peace is absolutely unshakable. May 11th, 1953

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 11th: Just as the Korean armistice negotiations have entered an important stage, and the people of the world are eager for a swift ceasefire, the U.S. invading air force in Korea has continuously intruded into our country's Northeast airspace several times on May 10th and 11th, and bombed Lagu Shao and Andong City.

At 10:27 a.m. on May 10th, seventeen enemy aircraft of F-84 type eleven and F-86 type six intruded into the airspace of Lagu Shao in Northeast China, and carried out bombing, dropping twenty bombs, injuring one person.

At 9:35 p.m. on the same day and 1:04 a.m. on May 11th, a total of eight U.S. invading air force B-29 and B-26 aircraft again intruded into the airspace of Andong in Northeast China in separate groups, scattered leaflets, and carried out bombing and strafing, dropping thirty-four bombs, killing forty-four residents, seriously injuring forty-one residents, and slightly injuring one hundred and seventy-one residents. A total of two hundred and fifty-seven people were killed and injured by U.S. aircraft, and more than one thousand one hundred houses were destroyed.

    对侵朝美空军侵犯我国领空杀伤我国人民的罪行向美国提出严重抗议
    【新华社十一日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来发表声明，抗议美机侵犯我国领空，杀伤我国人民。声明全文如下：
    一九五三年五月十日、十一日，美国侵朝空军以F—86、F—84、B—29、B—26型的飞机共二十五架，先后三次侵入中国东北的拉古哨和安东两地领空，撒下传单，并进行轰炸扫射，计投掷炸弹五十余枚，致中国居民死伤二百五十余人。这是美国政府继其多次侵犯中国领空、杀伤中国人民的罪行之后更加严重的一次挑衅行动。全中国人民对于美国政府这一侵略罪行，极为愤怒。因此，我受权向美国政府提出严重抗议。
    全世界人民渴望朝鲜停战。为了解决全部战俘问题以促成朝鲜停战，中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府先后于一九五三年三月三十日、三月三十一日发表声明，提出了公平合理的建议。由于这一建议，长期中断的朝鲜停战谈判得以恢复。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团在停战谈判会议上并已先后提出了两个解决全部战俘遣返问题的建设性的方案。现在，正当朝鲜停战谈判进行之际，美国政府竟出动其侵朝空军，侵犯中国领空，杀伤中国人民。显然，美国政府这一挑衅行动是在企图影响朝鲜停战谈判，并对全世界人民要求朝鲜停战的渴望，进行挑战。但是，可以断言，美国政府这一企图是一定要失败的。中朝两国人民为和平而奋斗的坚强意志是绝对不可动摇的。一九五三年五月十一日
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】正当朝鲜停战谈判进入重要阶段，全世界人民渴望迅速达成停战之际，美国侵朝空军竟于五月十日、十一日连续数次侵犯我国东北领空，并轰炸拉古哨和安东市。
    五月十日上午十时二十七分，敌机F—84型十一架、F—86型六架，共十七架，侵入我国东北境内拉古哨领空，进行轰炸，投弹二十枚，伤一人。
    同日下午九时三十五分、十一日上午一时零四分，美国侵朝空军B—29及B—26型的飞机共八架，又先后分批侵入我国东北安东领空，撒下传单，并进行轰炸扫射，投弹三十四枚，炸死居民四十四人，重伤居民四十一人，轻伤居民一百七十一人。前后总共被美机炸死炸伤二百五十七人，毁房屋一千一百余间。
