To our respected Chairman Mao:

We, the representatives from all regions, industries, and remote border areas of the country, entrusted with the earnest expectations of the entire working class, extend to you – our beloved leader – our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude.

For thirty years, it is you who led us – the Chinese working class – to break the chains of slavery, destroy the reactionary rule, and establish a bright and splendid New China. In the past four years, thanks to your care, our material and cultural lives have been significantly improved and enhanced with the fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation.

Now, our motherland has entered a new period of planned economic construction, and the Chinese working class has undertaken the glorious and arduous task of realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning to a socialist society.

You taught us: We must "transform an agricultural country into an industrial country" because "without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity."

Respected Chairman Mao, in accordance with your instructions, all of us workers must fully unleash our labor enthusiasm and creativity, overcome all phenomena that undermine labor discipline, extensively launch patriotic labor competitions, promote advanced experiences, and develop rationalization proposals to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, strictly conserve, reduce costs, and strive to complete and overfulfill the state's construction plans ahead of schedule.

Our entire working class must break with conservative thinking, strive to learn advanced Soviet science and technology and advanced experience, and improve our technical level.

All trade union workers must closely connect with the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, strengthen the construction of trade unions, improve the democratic life of trade unions, so as to raise the awareness and organization of the working masses, and make the trade unions truly become "builders of a new life" and "educators of new millions."

Respected Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class under your kind guidance has complete confidence: with your leadership and the leadership of the Party Central Committee, with our solid alliance with our peasant brothers and intellectuals, with the close unity of all strata of people in the country under your banner, and with the support of the working class of the world, especially the Soviet working class, we will surely turn the ideal that the Chinese people have dreamed of for a hundred years – the industrialization of the country – into reality. We wish you boundless longevity, and may you always lead us from victory to victory.

    中国工会第七次全国代表大会
    向毛泽东主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    我们，来自全国各个地区、各个产业以及遥远的边疆地区的代表们，受全体工人阶级的殷勤嘱托，谨向您——我们亲爱的领袖，致以最崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    三十年来，是您领导着我们——中国工人阶级，斩断了奴隶的锁链，摧毁了反动统治，建立了一个光辉灿烂的新中国。四年来，由于您的关怀，我们的物质和文化生活随着财政经济状况的根本好转已经获得了显著的改善和提高。
    现在，我们的祖国已进入有计划的经济建设的新时期，中国工人阶级已经承担起实现国家工业化及逐步过渡到社会主义社会这一光荣而艰巨的任务。
    您教导我们说：要“变农业国为工业国”，因为“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”
    敬爱的毛主席，遵照您的指示，我们全体工人，一定要充分地发挥劳动积极性和创造性，克服一切败坏劳动纪律的现象，广泛地展开爱国主义劳动竞赛，推广先进经验，开展合理化建议，来提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，严格节约，降低成本，争取提前完成和超额完成国家的建设计划。
    我们全国工人阶级，一定要打破保守思想、努力学习苏联的先进科学技术和先进经验，提高我们的技术水平。
    全体工会工作者，一定要密切联系群众，开展批评与自我批评，发扬成绩，克服缺点，加强工会的建设，健全工会的民主生活，以提高工人群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，使工会真正成为“新生活的建设者”，成为“新的千百万人的教育者”。
    敬爱的毛主席，在您亲切教诲下的中国工人阶级，有着完全的自信：有您和党中央的领导，有我们和农民兄弟与知识分子的巩固联盟，有全国各阶层人民在您的旗帜下的紧密团结，有全世界工人阶级特别是苏联工人阶级的支持，我们一定能把百年来中国人民梦寐以求的理想——国家的工业化变为现实。敬祝您万寿无疆，永远领导着我们，从胜利走向胜利。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会全体代表  一九五三年五月十一日
