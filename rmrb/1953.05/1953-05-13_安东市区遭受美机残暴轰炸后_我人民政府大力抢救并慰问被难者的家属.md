(Xinhua News Agency, Antung, 12th) Our reporter reports the details of the bombing of Antung by American invading aircraft as follows:

    At 9:35 PM on the 10th, six American invading air force B-29 and B-26 aircraft invaded the airspace of Antung in three batches, scattering a large number of reactionary leaflets before flying away. It was raining at the time. Two enemy B-29 bombers then launched a sneak attack from the northeast direction at 1:04 AM on the 11th, circling over Zhenjiangshan Park and the Zhenjiang Bridge area. At 1:06 AM, the enemy aircraft bombed and strafed here, dropping 34 bombs. Nearby houses were collapsed and many local residents were killed and injured. The American aircraft flew southwest towards Korea at 1:07 AM. The American aircraft launched a sneak attack on a rainy night, and nearby residents could not escape in time. A pregnant woman had just stepped out of her house when the American aircraft killed her and the baby about to be born. Labor model Sun Fa went to Harbin to attend a meeting, and his wife and two children were killed, and two other children were injured. The youngest child was only eight months old. When Youth League member Wang Fabo went to rescue them, Sun Fa's wife pointed to the eight-month-old child beside her and said her last words: "Comrade, I can't make it, save the child quickly." Railway worker Cao Guangjiu had five children, two of whom were killed and two injured. A total of more than 260 people were killed and injured by the American air force this time, including 27 children and 53 women. Among the compatriots who were bombed were workers, engineers, farmers, and students. People from all walks of life are extremely angry. Model military dependents Jiao Da Niang said: "The American government is hypocritical, talking about peace but secretly using ruthless tactics. I will definitely write to the volunteers to avenge us." Labor model Sun Fa rushed back from Harbin, carrying the bread he bought for his children, and looked at the vegetable garden that his wife had cultivated before her death, and tears fell from his eyes. He said: He is determined to fight against American imperialism and will never give up until victory.

    After the American aircraft bombing, provincial and municipal leaders also immediately went to the scene to inspect. Rescue model Qu Da Niang led the women's rescue team and medical personnel and self-defense team members from various districts rushed to the scene. Su Facheng, a rescue model from the Electric Power Bureau, and the workers climbed on the lampposts to repair the lines. The angered people carried out rescue work in an orderly manner in the heavy rain. The rescue work started during the bombing. Garrison soldier Dong Haishan used his body to cover a child near the post office. Dong Haishan was injured as a result, but the child survived safely. The injured residents have been sent to provincial and municipal hospitals. Under the emergency treatment of doctors, the lightly injured were discharged from the hospital one after another, most of the seriously injured were out of danger, and the dead compatriots have been buried. Gao Yang, Secretary of the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Tao, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, Chen Beichen, Mayor of the Antung Municipal People's Government, Deputy Mayor Duan Yongjie, and other responsible comrades and representatives of people from all walks of life went to express their condolences. The Harbin Railway Administration organized a delegation to express condolences, led by Deputy Director Zhuang Lin, to express condolences to the railway employees and residents' families who were victimized.

     【新华社安东十二日电】本社记者报道美国侵朝空军飞机轰炸安东的详情如下：
    十日下午九时三十五分，六架美国侵朝空军B—29、B—26型飞机分三批侵入安东上空，散布大量的反动传单后飞走。当时天正下雨。敌机B—29轰炸机两架又在十一日上午一点零四分从东北方向偷袭，在镇江山公园和镇江桥一带上空盘旋，一点零六分敌机即在这里轰炸扫射，投弹三十四枚，附近房屋被炸塌，当地居民伤亡甚多，美国飞机在一点零七分向西南朝鲜方向飞走。美国飞机在雨天夜里偷袭，附近居民躲避不及。有一位妊妇刚走出房门，美国飞机就炸死了她和将要出生的婴儿。劳动模范孙发到哈尔滨去开会，他的妻子和两个孩子被炸死，还有两个孩子被炸伤。其中最小的孩子才八个月。青年团员王法波去抢救时，孙发的妻子指着她身旁八个月的孩子说了最后的一句话：“同志，我不行了，快救孩子。”铁路员工曹广久有五个孩子，两个孩子被炸死，两个孩子被炸伤。被美国空军这次炸死和炸伤的，共有二百六十多人，其中有儿童二十七名、妇女五十三名。在被炸的同胞中有工人、工程师、农民和学生。各界人民极为愤怒。军属模范缴大娘说：“美国政府假仁假义嘴里说和平，偷着下毒手。我一定给志愿军写信给咱们报仇。”劳动模范孙发从哈尔滨赶回来，手里提着给孩子买的面包，望着妻子生前开辟的菜园，他落下眼泪。表示：坚决与美帝国主义作斗争，不胜利绝不罢手。
    美机轰炸后，省、市负责人也立刻到现场视察。抢救模范曲大娘带领着妇女救护队和各区医务人员、自卫队员纷纷赶到。电业局抢修模范苏发成和工人们爬在电灯杆上抢修线路。愤怒了的人们有秩序地冒着大雨进行抢救工作。抢救工作在轰炸时就开始了。驻军战士董海山在邮局附近用自己的身体挡盖着一个孩子。董海山因此负伤，孩子却安全地活着。被炸伤的居民已经送到省市立医院。在医生紧急医治下，轻伤者陆续出院，重伤大部分脱离了危险，死难的同胞已被安葬。中国共产党辽东省委员会书记高扬、省人民政府主席李涛、安东市人民政府市长陈北辰、副市长段永杰等负责同志和各界人民代表都前去慰问。哈尔滨铁路管理局组织了慰问团，在副局长庄林率领下前来慰问被难的铁路员工和居民的家属。
