    Repatriated British and Puerto Rican POWs
    Praise Our Humane Treatment
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 15th] The London "Daily Worker" reported that another nine repatriated British sick and wounded POWs returned to Lyneham Airport in Wiltshire on May 10th from Korea. Like the repatriated POWs who returned earlier, they praised the good treatment they received from the Korean and Chinese sides in the POW camps. They said that the POWs still in the POW camps were in excellent spirits.
    Private Robert Faith of the Gloucestershire Regiment (from King's Lynn) said that the nursing staff in the Korean and Chinese POW camps "really treated us well. On the first day I was captured at the Imjin River and sent to the POW camp, I received tobacco, cigarettes and chocolate... We regularly received supplies of tobacco and sweets, etc."
    Private Bowden of the Gloucestershire Regiment (from Norwich) confirmed that the treatment in the POW camp was the best any POW could hope for. He pointed out that the news spread by the Americans about the abuse of POWs in the POW camps was untrue. He said: "The food was worse at the beginning, but at least it was the same as what the Chinese ate." Later, the food improved, and the camp also played football, basketball and volleyball. He said, "In Changcheng, where I stayed last, we even held sports meets and competed with American POWs..."
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 15th] TASS, New York, May 14th: According to the Puerto Rican San Juan "El Mundo", a group of former Puerto Rican POWs who returned from Korea - including Corporal Alberto Vaes Pizarro, Private Epifanio Cordero Ramos and Juan Levilla Ortiz - held a press conference at San Juan Hospital. They said at the meeting that they received good medical care in the POW camp and were never subjected to the kind of abuse or thought training reported by American newspapers.

    被遣返的英国和波多黎各战俘
    称赞我方的人道待遇
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】伦敦“工人日报”报道说：又有九名被遣返的英国病伤战俘于五月十日从朝鲜返抵尉尔特郡的林汉姆飞机场。他们和以前回国的被遣返的战俘们一样，都称赞在战俘营中受到朝中方面的良好待遇。他们说，仍留在战俘营中的战俘们精神极好。
    格罗斯特团的士兵罗伯特·费斯（家住在金斯林）说：朝中战俘营中的护理人员“的确待我们很好。我在临津江被俘后被送入战俘营的第一天，我就领到烟草、香烟和巧克力糖……我们定期地得到烟草和糖果等供应品”。
    家住在瑙威治的格罗斯特团士兵鲍登证实说，战俘营中的待遇是任何战俘所希望得到的最好待遇。他指出美国人散布的关于战俘营中虐待战俘的消息是不符事实的。他说：“开始时食物较差，但是，至少跟中国人吃的是一样的。”后来食物改善了，营中还玩足球、篮球与排球。他说，“在我最后停留的昌城，我们甚至还举行运动会，与美国战俘比赛……”
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：据波多黎各圣约翰“世界报”报道说，一批从朝鲜回来的前波多黎各战俘——其中包括艾伯托·瓦埃斯·毕沙罗下士、士兵埃毕法尼奥·戈戴罗·拉莫斯和胡安·列威拉·奥尔蒂斯——在圣约翰医院举行记者招待会。他们在会上说，他们在战俘营时得到很好的医疗照顾，并且从来没有受到像美国报纸所报道的那种虐待或思想训练。
