    Uyghur Farmers in Turpan Basin Plant Over 30,000 Mu of Soviet Superior Cotton Seeds
    Uyghur farmers in the Turpan Basin have widely planted superior Soviet cotton seeds this year, and the cotton seedlings have now emerged from the ground.
    The three counties of Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun in the Turpan Basin are well-known cotton-producing areas in Xinjiang. In 1951, the People's Government began promoting the superior Soviet "Vesinet" cotton seeds here. After two years of trial planting, the climate and soil of the Turpan Basin proved to be very suitable for the growth of this cotton variety. Last year, the cotton planted by farmers using Soviet cotton seeds generally yielded over 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is one to three times higher than the yield of local cotton. This year, a total of over 38,000 mu of cotton fields have been planted in the Turpan Basin, of which over 31,000 mu have been planted with "Vesinet" cotton seeds. Currently, Uyghur farmers in the Turpan Basin are building soil ridges for each row of cotton seedlings in the cotton fields to protect the seedlings from wind and sand in May, in order to ensure a bumper harvest of cotton.

    吐鲁番盆地的维吾尔族农民
    播种三万多亩苏联优种棉花
    吐鲁番盆地的维吾尔族农民，今年普遍播种了苏联的优良棉种，现在棉苗已露出地面。
    吐鲁番盆地的吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊三县，是新疆著名的产棉区。一九五一年，人民政府在这里开始推广苏联优良的“湿乃得尔”棉种，经过两年来的试种结果，吐鲁番盆地的气候、土壤很适合这一棉种的生长。去年农民用苏联棉籽播种的棉花，每亩籽棉产量一般都在三百斤以上，比当地土棉的产量高出一倍到三倍。今年吐鲁番盆地共播种棉田三万八千多亩，其中有三万一千多亩都播种了“湿乃得尔”棉籽。现在，吐鲁番盆地的维吾尔族农民正在棉田里给每行棉苗筑土坎，保护棉苗度过五月间的风沙吹袭，以保证棉花的丰收。    （新华社）
