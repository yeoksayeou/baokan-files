On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Machinery General Plant Successfully Trials Large Vertical Lathe
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Machinery General Plant, a state-owned enterprise, has successfully trialed the largest machine tool in China: a large vertical lathe. This is a pioneering achievement in China's machinery industry and a significant support for the heavy industry construction of the whole country and Anshan.
    This large machine tool is made of four thousand seven hundred parts, weighs one hundred and forty tons, and is six meters high. The horizontal tool rest is nine meters long and is equipped with two cutting tools. The machine tool is powered by five electric motors, and all work is electrically controlled. Only two workers are needed to operate the machine by pressing the buttons and watching. Its operating speed can be adjusted according to the physical properties of the workpiece, from a minimum of one revolution every five minutes to a maximum of eight and a half revolutions per minute. It can turn external circles, internal holes, planes, and other machining operations on workpieces that are eight meters in diameter, three and a half meters high, and weigh thirty tons. It can also manufacture various large parts used in the steel rolling industry.
    The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Machinery General Plant began collecting data and designing this large machine tool, which had never been manufactured in China before, in April of last year. They began manufacturing in June and completed the trial production in May of this year. All parts of the machine tool were manufactured by the plant itself. It is now officially in production. The furnace top, furnace bottom, furnace shell, hopper of the No. 7 blast furnace being built at Anshan, and the mixing furnace for storing molten iron in the steel plant, as well as huge parts for many heavy industrial factories such as the First Cement Plant of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Building Materials Industry Administration, will be processed on this machine.

    Li Gaotian Successfully Creates Coal Pusher
    Li Gaotian, equipment engineer of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, successfully created a coal pusher. This coal pusher is installed on the coal water car of the locomotive. When it is turned on, it can automatically push the coal forward, pushing the coal in the coal bunker to the front opening of the coal bunker. This not only makes it convenient for the fireman to throw coal into the boiler, but also greatly reduces the physical labor of the fireman in passing coal forward in the coal bunker. Two locomotives at the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot have now been equipped with this coal pusher, and the crew members like it very much.
    This coal pusher is composed of two parts: an air cylinder and a hinged coal pusher. The air cylinder is made from a discarded locomotive brake cylinder; the hinged coal pusher is made of cast iron and consists of four sections connected by pins, with a coal shovel at the front. After the air enters the air cylinder from the locomotive's main air tank through the air pipe, it pushes the piston, which is transmitted to the hinged coal pusher through the piston rod, and the coal is pushed forward from the shovel by the coal pusher. Between the air cylinder and the hinged coal pusher, there is also a round cover made of discarded locomotive flue pipes to prevent coal from entering the hinged coal pusher and hindering movement.
    Dalian Chemical Plant Implements Safety Operation Certificate System
    The Dalian Chemical Plant has implemented a safety operation certificate system on the basis of last year's safety education, which has played a significant role in ensuring safe production.
    All employees of the plant must pass safety studies and examinations before being granted a safety operation certificate; workers who fail the examination and do not obtain a safety operation certificate cannot operate. Since the implementation of this system, more than 90 percent of the employees have received safety operation certificates.
    During the implementation of the safety operation certificate system, the plant encountered some ideological resistance. For example, some older workers had serious empiricism, believing, "Anyway, I can do practical work, it doesn't matter if I fail." Some administrative cadres and technical personnel believed: "If an accident occurs, the cadres will always have to bear certain responsibilities, why bother learning this thing." These erroneous ideas have been overcome after persuasion and education.
    After the Dalian Chemical Plant implemented the safety operation certificate system, workers were willing to record their glorious deeds on the safety operation certificate and were unwilling to record accidents, thus strengthening their attention to safety work. The vast majority of cadres have also paid more attention to safety work because their responsibilities are clearer after the implementation of the safety operation certificate system.
    Jiangsu Basically Completes Rice and Cotton Planting Work
    In Jiangsu Province, more than 30 million mu of rice fields have been sown with early and mid-season rice, and most of the late-season rice has also been sown. Seedlings planted earlier in the Yangzhou, Yancheng, and Zhenjiang areas are already more than two inches tall. During the sowing period, various localities vigorously promoted advanced farming methods. Songjiang County planned to use the leadership method of "typical continuous demonstration" to further promote Chen Yongkang's experience in high-yield rice production. From top to bottom, the county established a technology promotion organization, with more than 570 technology committee members directly visiting Chen Yongkang to learn about his methods of making seedbeds, selecting seeds with salt water, and sparsely planting seeds, and passing them on to the vast number of farmers at each level. In Qingpu County, farmers using salt water for seed selection account for more than 70 percent of the total number of farmers. After the farmers in Jiangsu Province realized the significant significance of increasing grain production to support national economic construction, the planting area of grain crops this year has been expanded by about 200,000 mu, most of which is rice.
    The cotton planting in Jiangsu Province has basically ended, and seedlings have emerged to more than one inch tall in the early-planted areas. Because various localities widely publicized the new cotton-grain price ratio standard during the sowing period, the province's cotton planting area is about 9 million mu, stabilizing at last year's cotton planting area. In order to strive to increase the yield per unit area, cotton farmers in various localities are working hard to improve farming methods. In Sheyang County, more than 500,000 mu of cotton fields have been cultivated once or twice, and the base fertilizer is 10 percent more than last year. In particular, they have changed the past habit of late planting and started sowing five to ten days earlier. In some areas, cotton farmers are seizing the gaps to dig ditches and prepare for drought and flood prevention. In areas with existing drought conditions, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have taken the lead in carrying water to plant seeds and sprinkle seedlings.

    Xinjiang Province Builds Small-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy
    This Year, More Than 390,000 Mu of Farmland Can Be Irrigated
    Xinjiang Province is vigorously building small-scale farmland water conservancy, and it is estimated that more than 390,000 mu of farmland can be irrigated this year.
    This spring, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau dispatched more than 90 cadres to Kashgar, Dihua, Yanqi, Yili, Ashan, and other places to focus on helping farmers of all ethnic groups carry out water conservancy surveying and design work. The special districts and counties in various agricultural areas have also mostly held water conservancy work meetings or agricultural production meetings to study and deploy water conservancy construction work. During the spring plowing period, all parts of the province have generally renovated old canals, and Yecheng, Maigaiti, Gashi, Toksun, Qitai, Burqin and other counties have also built new canals. The Jihala Basi Canal built by the Uygur farmers in the second district of Yecheng County is 20 kilometers long and can irrigate more than 9,000 mu of land. The Karaterek Canal built by the Kazakh and Uygur farmers in Burqin County was put into water in late April, irrigating 10,000 mu of land. In the extremely arid Turpan Basin, more than 800 karezes have been renovated and 45 new karezes have been dug this spring. The farmers in Turpan County have also built a reservoir with an area of 16 mu and a depth of 4 chi (approximately 1.3 meters).
    Farmland in Xinjiang is almost entirely irrigated by canals, and water sources are very precious. This year, all parts of the province have strengthened the water conservancy management system and implemented rational water use. Farmland irrigation committees have been organized for the Urumqi River, Manas River, Kizil River, and the Moyu River and Yulong River at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains. Among them, the farmland irrigation committees of the Moyu River and Yulong River appropriately resolved the historical water conservancy disputes among the masses in Hotan, Moyu, Yutian, and Lop County. In April, the spring wheat in the four counties was generally irrigated once.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    鞍钢机械总厂试制大型立式车床成功
    国营鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂试制我国最大的工作母机——大型立式车床成功。这是我国机械工业上的创举，也是对全国和鞍钢重工业建设的重大支援。
    这台大型工作母机是由四千七百个零件制成，重一百四十吨，高六公尺，横刀架长达九公尺，共装置有两部切削刀。这台机床用五部电动机来开动，全部工作都是用电气操纵。只要两个工人按电钮开动机器之后，在一边看着就可以了。它的运转速度，根据工作物的物理性能，能够调整到最慢五分钟转一圈，最快一分钟转八圈半。它能够给直径八公尺、高三公尺半、重三十吨的工作物进行外圆、内孔、平面等车削工作。并能车制轧钢工业上所用的各种大型零件。
    鞍钢机械总厂的职工们，去年四月开始搜集资料，设计这部大型的中国从来没有制造过的工作母机，六月开始制造，到今年五月试制完工。机床的全部零件也都由这个厂自己制造。现在它已正式投入生产。鞍钢正在修建的第七号炼铁炉的炉顶、炉底、炉皮、料斗和炼钢厂贮藏铁水的混铁炉，中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局第一水泥厂等许多重工业工厂的巨大零件，都将在这部机器上进行加工。

    李高田创造推煤机成功
    苏家屯机务段设备工程师李高田创造推煤机成功。这个推煤机安装在机车的煤水车上，开动起来能自动向前推煤，把煤斗里的煤推送到煤斗的前口，不但使司炉往锅炉里投煤时方便，还可以大大减轻司炉在煤斗里向前传煤的体力劳动。现在苏家屯机务段已经有两台机车安装了这个推煤机，乘务员们都很喜欢它。
    这个推煤机是由空气筒和活节推煤器两部分组成的。空气筒是利用的废机车制动筒；活节推煤器是利用生铁铸成的，共有四节，用销子连在一起，前方装有煤铲。空气由机车总风缸经过空气管进入空气筒之后，推动鞲鞴，经过鞲鞴杆传到活节推煤器中，煤就被推煤器从铁铲中向前推进。在空气筒与活节推煤器之间，还装有用机车废大烟管做成的圆罩，以防止煤炭进入活节推煤器，妨碍活动。
    大连化学厂实行安全作业证制度
    大连化学厂在去年的保安教育基础上，实行了安全作业证制度，对保证安全生产起了很大作用。
    该厂职工都须经过保安学习和考试及格后，才给予安全作业证；考试不及格得不到安全作业证的工人，就不能进行操作。这一制度实行以来，至今已有百分之九十以上的职工领到了安全作业证。
    该厂在实行安全作业证制度的过程中，曾遇到一些思想抵抗。例如在部分老工人中，存在着严重的经验主义，他们认为：“反正我能干实际工作，不及格也没啥关系。”有些行政干部和技术人员认为：
    “出了事故干部总得负一定责任，何必学这玩艺。”这些错误思想，经过说服教育后都已克服了。
    该厂实行安全作业证制度后，工人们都愿意在安全作业证上记上自己的光荣事迹，不愿记上事故，因而加强了他们对保安工作的注意。绝大多数干部，由于实行安全作业证后职责比较明确，也更加重视了保安工作。
    江苏基本完成水稻棉花播种工作
    江苏省三千多万亩水稻，早稻、中稻已全部播种，晚稻也大部播种结束。扬州、盐城、镇江地区早种的秧苗已有两寸多高。在播种期间，各地大力推广了先进耕作方法。松江县有计划地运用“典型连环示范”的领导方法，进一步推广陈永康的水稻丰产经验。全县自上而下建立了技术推广组织，有五百七十多个技术委员直接参观了陈永康做秧田、盐水选种、落谷稀等方法，并层层传授给广大农民。青浦县采用盐水选种的农户占总农户数百分之七十以上。江苏省农民认识到增产粮食对支援国家经济建设的重大意义后，今年粮食作物的播种面积扩大了约二十万亩，其中大部分是水稻。
    江苏省棉田播种基本结束，早播地区已出苗一寸多高。由于各地在播种期间广泛宣传了新的棉粮比价标准，全省植棉面积约九百万亩，稳定在去年的植棉面积上。各地植棉农民为了争取提高单位面积产量，都努力改进耕作方法。射阳县五十多万亩棉田普遍耕过一遍到二遍，基肥比去年多百分之十，特别是改变了过去迟种的习惯，提早播种五天到十天。有些地区植棉农民抓紧空隙开沟挖墒，准备抗旱防涝。已有旱象的地区，农业生产合作社和互助组纷纷带头挑水点播泼苗。    （据新华社讯）
    新疆省兴修小型农田水利
    今年可增灌农田三十九万多亩
    新疆省各地正在大力兴修小型农田水利，预计今年可增灌农田三十九万多亩。
    今春，新疆省人民政府水利局抽调九十多名干部分赴喀什、迪化、焉耆、伊犁、阿山等地，重点地帮助各民族农民进行水利的勘测、设计工作。各农业地区的专区、县也大多召开了水利工作会议或农业生产会议，研究和布置了水利建设工作。在春耕期中，全省各地都普遍整修了旧有渠道，叶城、麦盖提、伽师、托克逊、奇台、布尔津等县还兴修了新的渠道。叶城县第二区维吾尔族农民所修的及合拉巴斯渠长达二十公里，可增灌土地九千多亩。布尔津县的哈萨克、维吾尔族农民兴修的卡拉特列克渠已在四月下旬放水，增灌了一万亩土地。在极端干旱的吐鲁番盆地今春已整修坎井八百多道，新凿坎井四十五道。吐鲁番县的农民还修好了面积十六亩、深四尺的蓄水库一座。
    新疆农田几乎全靠渠道灌溉，水源非常珍贵。今年全省各地都加强了水利管理制度，实行合理用水。乌鲁木齐河、玛纳斯河、克孜里河以及昆仑山脚下的墨玉河和玉龙河，都组织了农田灌溉委员会。其中墨玉河和玉龙河的农田灌溉委员会适当地解决了和阗、墨玉、于阗和洛浦四县群众历史性的水利纠纷，四月间，四县春麦都普遍浇了一次水。
