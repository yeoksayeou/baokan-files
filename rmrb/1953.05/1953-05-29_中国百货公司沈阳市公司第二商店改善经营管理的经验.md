Experiences of the No. 2 Store of the Shenyang Municipal Company of China Department Store in Improving Operation and Management
Li Jiyao

Since 1952, the No. 2 Store of the Shenyang Municipal Company of China Department Store (hereinafter referred to as the No. 2 Store) has determined its capital and implemented advanced operation and management methods such as fixed personnel and quotas for sales teams. The amount of capital occupied has been greatly reduced, sales have increased, capital turnover has accelerated, labor efficiency has improved, and circulation costs have become more reasonable.

The fundamental experience gained by the No. 2 Store in improving its operation and management is: using capital, organizing commodity circulation, and organizing labor in accordance with the principles of economic accounting and planned operation.

In order to rationally utilize capital, the No. 2 Store determined inventory quotas and verified capital. Initially, leading cadres were impatient, and the salespersons could not distinguish the boundaries between the supply system and economic accounting. During the first capital verification, each sales team compressed the reasonable inventory quite a bit. The cotton yarn team had a monthly sales target of 500 million yuan, but set the inventory at 270 million yuan, which was only enough for half a month's sales. After criticizing this tendency of focusing only on turnover and neglecting supply, the phenomenon of blindly expanding inventory occurred during the second capital verification. Each sales team ordered best-selling commodities as "reasonable inventory quotas." The fabric team stored 500 pieces of a certain brand of gabardine, which could not be sold out in two quarters. However, the standard for capital turnover was only a little over a month, which excessively occupied state funds. In order to determine the amount of capital that "both ensures supply and accelerates turnover," they specifically analyzed the actual inventory situation: At the end of August 1952, the total inventory value was 23.6 billion yuan, of which 6 billion yuan was in slow-moving, defective, and backlogged goods, 6 billion yuan was in excess inventory, and only 11 or 12 billion yuan was actually participating in circulation. Therefore, this portion of capital that frequently participated in circulation was a relatively reasonable "natural quota." After one audit, the problems of excessive and insufficient inventory were corrected, and the final fixed circulating capital was 10.6 billion yuan, which was relatively close to the actual situation.

The capital had just been verified when it encountered a test of reality. In September of last year, it was necessary to complete a sales task of 8 billion yuan. The season was changing, and many seasonal commodities had to be purchased, but the capital was tied up in inventory commodities, and only 1.4 billion yuan was available from bank credit. What to do? There was only one way: sell the inventory commodities as much as possible, free up the money, and prepare more marketable commodities for the next quarter.

The administrative department required that 70 percent of the inventory commodities be promoted. The trade union and the Communist Youth League launched a patriotic pact among the salespersons, focusing on expanding the promotion of inventory commodities, calling for inventory checks, commodity ranking, and the development of promotional competitions. The salespersons began to check the commodities they managed, from the books to the actual inventory, from best-selling to defective, analyzing them one by one and making promotional plans. The fabric team found more than 20,000 feet of accumulated fabric remnants in the inventory and made a plan to sell them within a month. Each team found slow-moving, backlogged, and defective goods. Some of these commodities had been accumulated for two or three years, and some had been accumulated for two or three quarters. This time, they were all placed on the counters, and special bargain sections were added. From September to November, the value of slow-moving, defective, and backlogged goods sold was more than 300 million yuan, which, according to the No. 2 Store's capital quota, was equivalent to reducing the inventory backlog by about 3 percent.

After conducting inventory checks and asset verification, they launched a promotional competition to solve the problem of large inventories and slow turnover. This created conditions for purchasing a large number of new commodities and fully supplying the needs of the people. Therefore, they overfulfilled the sales plan and the purchase plan. In the fourth quarter of 1952, sales exceeded the plan by 9.45 percent, and in the first quarter of this year, both the sales plan and the purchase plan were completed by 106 percent. While completing the plan and ensuring supply, the capital turnover was accelerated. Calculated according to September 1952, the capital turnover period required 65 days. According to October, it only required 53 and a half days. According to November, it only required 40 days, and according to December, it only required 32 days.

However, this capital verification cannot make the inventory amount reach a permanently reasonable level. Because the store has to "buy" and "sell" every day, the situation is constantly changing. How can we always keep the inventory reasonable and accelerate turnover? The No. 2 Store implemented planned operation, a method of organizing commodity circulation in a planned way.

The No. 2 Store's business activities are controlled by both planning and finance. The planning section uses the "inflow, sales, and inventory balance sheet" to check the daily sales situation of the counters and the customers' feedback. It extracts the daily best-selling and slow-selling commodities, as well as changes in consumer targets, from the team diaries and compiles them into "daily sales reports," which are submitted to the business section and the director's office. The business section guides the team's business activities based on this material and the actual situation, and urges the teams that have not completed the daily plan to complete the plan. The finance section controls business activities from the revenue and expenditure plan. At the end of each month, the finance section proposes credit and occupation restriction figures, and decides how much more goods the business section should buy in or sell out. The business section buys in the commodities needed by the sales teams according to the "daily sales report." This is like a pair of pliers, one jaw is planning—checking purchases and sales; the other jaw is finance—supervising revenue and expenditure, tightly clamping down on business activities and putting them on the road of planned operation.

In order to highly develop the labor efficiency of the staff, the No. 2 Store implemented a system of fixed personnel and quotas and extra-quota rewards. First, six teams were selected for key experiments. At the beginning, the teams all said, "To sell more money, we must add more salespersons, otherwise we will be too busy." The leading cadres then measured the working time of each salesperson. Using the average salesperson as the standard, from the customer looking at the goods to issuing the invoice, collecting the money, packing, and delivering the goods, the average time for each transaction was marked, and then the average number of transactions per day and the average transaction amount per transaction were calculated. After marking, it was proved that the working time of the busiest salesperson only accounted for 70 percent of each working day (including non-transactions and auxiliary labor time), and 30 percent of the time was still idle. This exposed the lie of "personnel shortage." Finally, according to the marking of labor efficiency and the seasonality of supply and sales, as well as the material situation, the fixed number of each team was determined according to the new sales task. A total of 59 salespersons could be drawn from the fifteen sales teams to do other work. The utensils team, which used to complain about personnel shortages, reduced two people, and the team's task was overfulfilled by 128 percent. The salespersons who were not energetic in the team before also sorted out commodities and learned bookkeeping in the sales leisure time. The phenomenon of dependence and uneven busyness was eliminated in the team.

The implementation of fixed personnel and quotas improved labor efficiency and also facilitated the implementation of the extra-quota reward system. Sales teams that overfulfilled the state plan were able to receive extra-quota rewards. In the fourth quarter of 1952, eleven teams overfulfilled the task and received a bonus of 4.78 million yuan. The salespersons said, "Improving labor efficiency is consistent with personal interests, and more work means more pay."

How can labor efficiency be further improved on the basis of improvement? At the beginning, some people said, "Goods must be sold one by one, and people are not machines, so labor efficiency cannot be further improved." However, the results are often very different due to the different sales organizations and techniques for the same commodities and the same salespersons. Originally, children's products and toys were displayed on the fifth floor of the No. 2 Store. How troublesome and heavy a burden it was for a woman to hold a child and squeeze through the crowd to climb more than 100 stairs! Therefore, the children's products team was often deserted. In accordance with the spirit of convenience for consumers, the No. 2 Store moved children's products to the first floor, and since then, the counters have always been crowded with customers.

In terms of sales procedures, the No. 2 Store implemented three different methods of collecting money and delivering goods according to the different conditions of the commodities. The consumers of the hardware and electrical materials team were all institutions and groups, and the commodities they managed were bulky and expensive. According to this situation, they implemented a system of specialized responsibility for issuing invoices, collecting money, and delivering goods. The fabric team implemented a card sales system. Scattered commodities adopted the sales method of one hand money and one hand goods. This is as the store director said: "One principle of our store's sales organization and methods is for the convenience and needs of customers, and the other principle is to adapt to the internal business development and strict management system of the store." The No. 2 Store is constantly improving the sales organization and technology, and labor efficiency is getting higher and higher, and the average sales amount of each salesperson is also increasing month by month.

    中国百货公司沈阳市公司第二商店改善经营管理的经验
    李继尧
    中国百货公司沈阳市公司第二商店（以下简称第二商店）从一九五二年起，核定了资金，实行了营业小组定员定额等先进的经营管理方法，资金占用量大大缩减，卖钱额上升，资金周转加速，劳动效率提高，流转费用趋于合理。
    第二商店在改善经营管理过程中取得的根本经验是：按照经济核算制和计划经营的原则运用资金、组织商品流转、组织劳动。
    为了合理地运用资金，第二商店进行了确定库存定额，核定资金的工作。最初领导干部有急躁情绪，营业员们也分不清供给制和经济核算制的界限，在第一次核定资金时，各售货小组把合理的库存也压缩了不少。花纱小组每月卖钱任务是五亿元，却把库存订到二亿七千万元，只够半个月的销售。批判了这种只顾周转忽视供应的偏向以后，第二次核定资金时，又发生了盲目扩大库存的现象，各营业小组把畅销的商品都订作“合理的库存定额”。布匹组把一种牌号的华达呢存了五百匹，两个季度也卖不完，可是资金周转的标准只有一个多月，这就过多地占用了国家的资金。为了确定“既要保证供应，又要加速周转”的资金数额，他们就具体地分析实际库存情况：一九五二年八月末，库存总值是二三六亿元，其中冷、残、背货值六十亿元，超额库存六十亿元，真正参加流转的才一百一、二十亿元。那末，这部分经常参加流转的资金就是比较合理的“自然定额”。经过一次审核，纠正了库存过多、过少的毛病，最后确定流动资金为一○六亿元，这个定额是比较接近实际的。
    资金刚刚核定，就遇到了事实的考验。去年九月份要完成八十亿元的销售任务，眼看到了换季的时节，许多季节性商品要买进来，但资金是用库存商品顶的，能够动用的只有银行信贷部分的十四亿元。怎么办？只有一条路：把库存的商品尽量卖出去，腾下钱来，再多准备下一个季度的适销商品。
    行政方面要求推销库存商品百分之七十。工会和青年团发动营业员订立了以扩大推销库存商品为中心内容的爱国公约，号召清查库存，进行商品排队，开展推销竞赛运动。营业员们开始清查他们自己所掌管的商品，从帐面查到实存，从畅销的查到了残废的，一样一样地进行分析，作出推销计划。布匹组从库存里查出积存下来的布头两万多尺，订了一项计划，在一个月之内销出去。每个小组都找出了冷、背、残货。这些商品有的已积压了两三年，有的已积压了两三个季度。这回都摆到柜台上去，增设了剔庄特价部。从九月到十一月，销出的冷、残、背货值三亿多元，按第二商店的资金定额计算，等于减少了百分之三左右的库存积压。
    他们在清产核资之后，开展了推销竞赛运动，解决了库存庞大、周转迟缓的问题，这就有条件大量采购新商品，充分供应人民的需要了。因此，他们超额完成了销售计划和采购计划。一九五二年第四季度超过销售计划百分之九·四五，今年第一季度的销售计划和采购计划都完成了百分之一百零六。在完成计划，保证供应的条件下加速了资金周转，资金周转期按一九五二年九月份计算，需六十五天周转一次，按十月份计算，只需要五十三天半周转一次，按十一月份计算，只需要四十天周转一次，按十二月份计算周转一次只需三十二天了。
    但是，这一次核定资金，是不能使库存额达到永远合理的程度。因为商店每天都要“买入”和“卖出”，情况时刻都在变化。怎样才能经常使库存合理和加速周转呢？第二商店实行了计划经营，有计划地组织商品流转的办法。
    第二商店的业务活动是受着计划、财务两方面的控制的。计划股用“进、销、存平衡表”的形式检查每天柜台售货情况和顾客的反映，将每天多销、少销的商品以及消费对象的变化，从小组日记里摘录出来，汇编成“每日销售情况”，交到业务股、主任室。业务股根据这个材料和实际情况，指导小组的业务活动，督促没有完成当日计划的小组完成计划。财务股从收支计划上控制业务活动。每到月终，财务股就提出信贷、占用限制数字，决定业务股再买进或销出多少货。业务股根据“每日销售情况”的记载，买进营业小组所需要的商品。这恰如一把钳子一样，一股是计划——检查购销；另一股是财务——监督收支，紧紧地钳住业务活动，使它走上计划经营的道路。
    为了高度发挥工作人员的劳动效率，第二商店实行了定员定额和超额奖励制度。首先选定了六个小组进行重点试验。一开始，小组里都说：“要多卖钱，就必须多添营业员，不然忙不过来。”领导干部就来测定每个营业员的劳动时间。用中等营业员作标准，从顾主看货到开票、交款、包装、付货，标定每次交易的平均时间，然后再计算每天的平均交易次数、每次的平均成交金额。经过标定之后，证明最忙的营业员每天的工作时间只不过占每个工作日的百分之七十（包括未成交及辅助劳动时间），百分之三十的时间仍然是空闲的。这就揭穿了“人员不足”的底。最后，按照劳动效率的标定和供销的季节性以及物资情况，根据新的销售任务，确定了各组的定员额。十五个售货小组，共可抽出五十九名营业员去作别的工作。从前叫人员不足的器皿小组减少了两个人，小组任务还超额完成了百分之一百二十八。原来在小组里工作不起劲的营业员，也在营业空闲时间整理商品、学习记帐了，小组里消灭了依赖现象和闲忙不均的现象。
    实行定员定额，提高了劳动效率，也便利了实行超额奖励制度。超额完成国家计划的售货小组，都能够得到超额奖励。一九五二年第四季度有十一个小组超额完成了任务，就得到了奖金四百七十八万元。营业员们说：“提高劳动效率和个人利益是一致的，多劳多得。”
    怎样才能使劳动效率在提高了的基础上再提高呢？开始有人说：“货要一份一份地卖，人总不是机器，劳动效率不能再提高了。”但是，同样的商品、同样的营业员，因为售货组织和技术的不同，其结果往往是相差很远的。原来第二商店的五楼上陈列着儿童用品和玩具。一个妇女抱着孩子挤过人群，走上一百多级的楼阶，是多么麻烦，多么沉重的负担呵！所以，儿童用品组往往是冷冷清清的。第二商店根据便利消费者的精神，将儿童用品迁到一楼，从此以后，柜台前总是拥挤着顾主。
    在售货手续上，第二商店按不同商品的情况，实行了三种不同的收款、付货办法。五金电料组的消费对象都是机关团体，经营的商品笨重、价高。他们根据这种情况，实行了开票、收款、付货专责制。布匹组实行了卡片售货制。零星的商品采用一手钱、一手货的销售办法。这正如商店主任所说的：“我们商店的售货组织和办法，一个原则是为了顾主方便和需要，另一个原则就是适应商店内部的业务发展和严格的管理制度。”第二商店不断地改善售货组织和技术，劳动效率越来越高了，每个营业员的平均卖钱额也逐月提高了。
