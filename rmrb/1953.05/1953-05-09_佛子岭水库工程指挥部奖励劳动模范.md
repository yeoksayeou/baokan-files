Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 8th: At the Fozi岭 Reservoir project, many workers have been selected as model workers during the year of construction. At the first celebration meeting held by the Fozi岭 Reservoir Project Headquarters on April 24th, 176 model workers including Zheng Jiuhong, Liu Wenbin, Hu Yesheng, and Zhu Genxing were rewarded.

The workers at the Fozi岭 Reservoir come from all over the country. With full enthusiasm for building the motherland, they overcame many difficulties in the construction, enabling the construction of the reservoir to proceed smoothly. The old worker Zheng Jiuhong, is an old man with thirty-eight years of work experience, but in his work, he labors as enthusiastically and intensely as a young man. Last year, sixteen rock drilling machines on the construction site kept having accidents, which almost forced the rock drilling project to stop. At that time, some workers reduced their confidence in repairing them because they could not buy foreign parts. At this time, Zheng Jiuhong painstakingly studied and tried every means to make his own parts, and finally repaired all these rock drilling machines. The drilling worker Liu Wenbin saw that the drilling machine often needed to be moved, wasting a lot of time and slowing down the work progress, so he came up with a flow-line operation method for moving the drilling machine. Originally, it took nine hours to move a drilling machine, but after adopting the flow-line operation method, it only took three hours. This improvement not only greatly improved work efficiency, but also saved the country more than 130 million yuan. The main project of the Fozi岭 Reservoir is the concrete pouring of the arch dam. Therefore, it is very difficult to do a good job in the processing and supply of yellow sand and gravel (raw materials for mixing concrete). When the construction of the Fozi岭 Reservoir project began last year, it was difficult to ensure the supply of sand and gravel because the old method of using a single-layer screen was used for sand and gravel processing. The porter Ma Mingxing and others painstakingly researched and developed a "layered sand and gravel screen", which could screen out four different specifications of gravel at once, thus solving the difficulty of not being able to supply sand and gravel, and saving the country 2 billion yuan. The rebar workers Yu Asan and Chen Shangcai came up with a new method of straightening bent rebars, which increased work efficiency by about one time. Chen Shangcai has put forward a total of twenty-five rationalization proposals in the past year, fifteen of which have been adopted. It is estimated that the recent improvement of the concrete mixer feeding hopper alone can save 70 million yuan.

The model workers have all demonstrated the noble qualities of the working class, being brave and fearless, in their work. In the severe cold of winter, the carpenter Xu Chenglong took the lead in getting up in the middle of the night to clear the snow on the construction site, ensuring that work could proceed as usual the next morning. In order to ensure that the progress of the project was not delayed, the cement worker Zhao Zhizhong often stood in the biting cold water to rinse the concrete last winter. The working spirit of the model workers is very touching.

### 佛子岭水库工程指挥部奖励劳动模范

    佛子岭水库工程指挥部奖励劳动模范
    【新华社蚌埠八日电】参加佛子岭水库工程的工人，在一年来的施工当中，许多人被评选为劳动模范。四月二十四日佛子岭水库工程指挥部举行的第一次庆功大会上，郑久鸿、刘文彬、胡业盛、朱根兴等一百七十六位模范受到了奖励。
    佛子岭水库上的工人来自全国各地。他们怀着建设祖国的满腔热情，在施工中战胜了重重困难，使建库工程得以顺利进行。老工人郑久鸿，是个已有三十八年工龄的老汉了，工作中，他却像青年人一样热情而紧张地劳动着。去年工地上有十六部开山机不断发生事故，使得开山工程几乎要被迫停工。当时有些工人因为买不到外国货的配件而减低了修理的信心。这时郑久鸿苦心钻研，想尽办法自制配件，终于将这些开山机全部修好。钻探工人刘文彬看到钻探机经常需要移动，浪费很多时间，工作进展不快，就想法创造了搬运钻探机的流水作业法。本来搬一次钻探机需要九小时，采用流水作业法后，只要三小时就行了。这一改进不仅大大提高了工作效率，并为国家节省了一亿三千多万元。佛子岭水库的主要工程是在连拱坝作浇筑混凝土的工程。所以做好黄砂和石子（拌和混凝土的原料）的加工供应工作是十分艰巨的。去年佛子岭水库工程开始施工时，由于砂石加工是用的一层筛子的老办法，以致难以保证砂石的供应。搬运工人马明星等苦心钻研，制造了“分层砂石筛”，一下子就可筛出四种不同规格的石子，因而解决了砂石供应不上的困难，并为国家节省了二十亿元。扎铁工人于阿三和陈尚才想出把弯钢筋拉直的新办法，使工作效率提高了约一倍。陈尚才一年来共提出了二十五件合理化建议，被采用的达十五件，仅最近改进混凝土拌和机进料斗一项，估计即可节省七千万元。
    劳动模范们在工作中，都发挥了工人阶级勇敢无畏的高贵品质。在冬天的严寒里，木工徐成龙带头半夜起床，到工地上扫清积雪，保证了第二天早上照常工作。水泥工人赵治忠为了保证不误工程的进度，去年冬天经常站在刺骨的冷水里冲洗混凝土。劳动模范们的这种工作精神，十分使人感动。
