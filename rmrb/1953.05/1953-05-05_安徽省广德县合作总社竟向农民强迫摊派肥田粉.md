    The Guangde County Cooperative of Anhui Province Actually Forcibly Apportioned Fertilizer to Farmers

    Tan Qin, of the CCP Guangde County Committee in Anhui Province, writes: The Guangde County Cooperative of Anhui Province engaged in apportionment when supplying fertilizer this spring. The reason for this phenomenon is: the superior cooperative (Editor's note: The original letter did not specify which level of cooperative) instructed that this batch of fertilizer should be sold for cash when topdressing spring wheat. This batch of fertilizer totals 120,000 catties, with a price of 1,800 yuan per catty, totaling 216 million yuan. It is very difficult for the farmers in our county to come up with cash to buy all of this fertilizer during the period of spring plowing and grain shortage. However, the Guangde County Cooperative mechanically implemented the instructions of the superior cooperative, regardless of the current economic capabilities of the local farmers, and distributed the fertilizer equally to the districts. Now several districts have distributed the fertilizer to the townships; some townships have, in turn, apportioned it to the farmers for sale. Some farmers were forced to buy some. One farmer in Xiangling Township, Shanbei District, after being "allocated" one catty and twelve taels of fertilizer, wanted to dump it into the river. Although some districts have not apportioned and sold the fertilizer, it is all stockpiled in the cooperative, and no one knows what to do.

    安徽省广德县合作总社竟向农民强迫摊派肥田粉
    中共安徽广德县委会谭琴来信：安徽省广德县合作总社在今年春季供应肥田粉时有摊派现象。造成这种现象的原因是：上级合作社（编者按：原信未说明是何级合作社）指示要把这批肥田粉在春小麦上追肥时以现款出售。这批肥田粉共十二万斤，每斤价格一千八百元，共值二亿一千六百万元。要我县农民在春耕缺粮期间拿现款来购完这批肥料是很难办到的事。但广德县社却机械地执行上级社指示，不顾当前当地农民的经济能力，就将肥田粉平均分配到区。现在有几个区已将肥田粉分配到乡；有的乡又平均向农户摊卖。有的农民被迫买了一些，山北区祥凌乡一个农民“配售”到一斤十二两肥田粉后，要把它倒在河里去。有些区虽没把肥田粉摊派卖出，但都积压在合作社，不知怎样办才好。
