Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: Township planning work has been widely launched in the North China region. The completion of this work will lay a good foundation for grassroots election work.

The currently dispersed administrative villages in North China will be divided into administrative townships. In this way, each county will be reduced from leading two or three hundred, or even five or six hundred administrative villages through the district people's government, to one hundred, with a maximum of no more than one hundred and forty townships, and will be directly led by the county. This method of reducing administrative units and reducing leadership levels is of great benefit to strengthening rural leadership, and also provides favorable conditions for grassroots elections.

Before starting township planning, all parts of North China made full preparations. The North China Administrative Committee and Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces successively held township planning meetings to study and deploy township planning work. Before the meetings, Shanxi and Hebei provinces conducted typical experimental work on township planning in different types of regions such as mountainous areas, plains, and agricultural and pastoral areas.

Township planning work in various places is being carried out in conjunction with the preparatory work for grassroots elections. Hebei Province has established a special office with township planning and election groups under it; a large number of cadres have been mobilized to participate in township planning work throughout the province. In the nine special districts of Tianjin, Tongxian, etc., and in 135 counties, more than 12,000 cadres have participated in township planning work. The township planning work in Shanxi Province is also being carried out under the leadership of the Provincial Election Committee. All counties have successively held township planning work conferences, and the first batch of township planning work has now begun. Because the original administrative villages in Suiyuan Province were relatively large, only small-scale adjustments will be made, and no large-scale township planning work will be carried out. Typical experiments are currently underway; township planning work throughout the province will be carried out in conjunction with the general election in mid-June.

All localities pay attention to closely integrating with production in township planning work. After the township planning work group arrives in the village, they first arrange production work and then carry out township planning. This practice is supported by the masses.

The township planning work in the entire North China region is expected to be completed by the end of July.

    华北区划乡工作已经普遍展开
    【新华社二十九日讯】华北区的划乡工作已普遍展开。这一工作的完成将为基层选举工作打下良好的基础。
    华北区目前分散的行政村将划为行政乡。这样，各个县将由过去依托区人民政府领导全县二、三百个甚至五六百个行政村，缩减到一百个最多不超过一百四十个乡，并由县直接领导。这种减少行政单位、减少领导层次的办法，对于加强农村领导工作有很大好处，同时也为基层选举提供了有利的条件。
    华北区各地在开始划乡前，都作了充分的准备。华北行政委员会和河北、山西等省先后召开了划乡会议，研究布置了划乡工作。山西、河北两省在会议前，曾分别在山区、平原、农牧区等不同类型的地区进行了划乡的典型试验工作。
    各地划乡工作是结合着基层选举的准备工作进行的。河北省专门成立了办公室，下设划乡、选举两组；全省已动员大批干部参加划乡工作。天津、通县等九个专区一百三十五个县，参加划乡工作的干部已有一万二千余名。山西省的划乡工作，也是在省选举委员会领导下进行的，各县都先后召开了划乡工作会议，第一批划乡工作现已开始。绥远省因原来行政村较大，只作小范围内的调整，不进行大规模的划乡工作，现正进行典型试验；全省范围内的划乡工作，将在六月中旬结合普选进行。
    各地在划乡工作中注意密切结合生产。划乡工作组到村后，首先把生产工作安排好，然后再进行划乡。这种作法得到群众的拥护。
    华北全区的划乡工作，预计在七月底全部结束。
