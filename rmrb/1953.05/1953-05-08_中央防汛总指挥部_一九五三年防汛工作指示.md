    Central Flood Control Headquarters
    1953 Flood Control Work Instructions

    The flood season has now arrived for rivers south of the Yangtze River, and the flood season for rivers in other regions is also approaching. To ensure increased agricultural production this year and to guarantee the safety of people's lives, industry, mining, and transportation, the following points are made regarding this year's flood control work, in addition to continuing to implement the spirit of the 1951 Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's "Instructions on Strengthening Flood Control Work" and previous years' flood control instructions. It is hoped that all localities will study and implement these based on their specific circumstances:

    1.  Raise vigilance and strictly prevent complacency. Over the past three years, we have carried out preliminary treatment of rivers across the country, and many works have continued this year. These will provide favorable conditions for this year's flood control work; however, it must be pointed out that the struggle to eliminate water disasters in our country is a long-term, complex, and arduous task, and the damage from waterlogging, in particular, cannot be completely eliminated in the short term. Therefore, we must not overestimate past achievements, nor should we have any blindly optimistic or negligent ideas about this year's flood control work. It must be recognized that the gradual reduction of floods across the country over the past three years is partly due to the role of water conservancy projects, but the fact that most regions have not experienced particularly heavy rainfall or abnormal floods (except for individual river basins) is also an important factor. We must face this reality squarely and make various preparations ideologically and practically. This is a crucial key to determining whether we can overcome this year's floods; otherwise, we will be at a loss in serious situations, unable to act, and cause unnecessary losses. Leading organs at all levels must educate cadres and the masses, correctly assess the actual situation, and conscientiously prepare for flood control work.

    2.  On the basis of the struggle against bureaucracy, and based on the problems exposed in design and construction, and the opinions put forward by the masses, water conservancy departments at all levels should immediately work with relevant departments to organize sufficient forces to conduct a systematic and in-depth inspection of important embankments, sea dikes, and control projects. When inspecting embankments and sea dikes, attention should be paid not only to easily detectable phenomena and local shortcomings on the surface, such as whether the height and slope of the embankment meet standards, whether various breaches are well closed, whether cracks, wave nests, and rain gullies have been repaired, whether dangerous points and revetment fascine dikes have settled or decayed, whether new embankments and new dangerous points are under the responsibility of someone for defense, and whether obstacles in the riverbed have been removed, etc.; but also attention must be paid to checking for hidden dangers inside the embankments, understanding changes in the river beaches and the movement of the main current, so as to comprehensively consider whether the existing river channels, embankments, and sea dikes can withstand possible floods and high tides. When inspecting flood storage projects and various sluice gates and culverts, the first thing to check is whether there is a dedicated person in charge of management, or whether the existing management personnel are familiar with the function and operation methods of the project. At the same time, a thorough inspection should be made of whether the building itself is damaged, paying particular attention to whether there is seepage or scouring. The gates and switching mechanisms should be checked to ensure that they open and close flexibly, and opening and closing should be tested during the inspection. The shortcomings and problems found during the systematic and in-depth inspection should be resolved in a timely manner, and a specific unit should be held responsible for improvement.

    3.  In the work of inspecting embankments, in addition to the general inspection mentioned above, the drilling method of the Yellow River embankment should be vigorously promoted. The drilling work on the Yellow River embankment has achieved great results over the past three years. According to statistics, a total of 36 million holes have been drilled, and 60,650 cavities have been found, which have been repaired in a timely manner, playing a huge role in consolidating the Yellow River embankment. In 1952, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and other provinces hired Yellow River drilling workers to conduct training experiments locally, which proved effective, indicating that this advanced experience is generally applicable whether in southern or northern China; however, there are still some regions that have not paid enough attention to it and have failed to organize and promote this method effectively. In order to do a good job in this year's flood control work, leading organs at all levels should attach importance to this advanced experience and promote it with a focus, following the practices of Guangdong and Jiangxi. Conducting an inspection and repair using the drilling method on the important embankments of important rivers before the flood season will have a great effect on consolidating embankments and strengthening flood control effectiveness.

    4.  Attention must be paid to the operation of flood storage, flood diversion, and other projects. We have carried out many flood control projects over the past three years, and special attention should be paid to the management and operation of these projects during the flood season. This is of great importance to the success or failure of flood control work. Therefore, all managers of critical and large flood control projects must be fully trained in advance and make all preparations. It must also be clearly stipulated how various interconnected projects in rivers that have undergone fundamental treatment should be coordinated to achieve the greatest effect in reducing flood peaks and eliminating waterlogging, so as to be clear in mind and avoid inappropriate temporary measures that lead to unnecessary losses. The management of general culverts should be assigned to specific personnel responsible, and if leakage or damage is found during inspection, repairs must be carried out in a timely manner; during the flood season, strict defense should be maintained day and night to ensure that they play their full role. All areas that are prepared for flood storage must be explained to the masses in advance, without concealment, and in-depth publicity should be carried out to explain the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests. Compensation methods should also be stipulated in advance for the masses who suffer losses due to flood storage, and announced to the masses to dispel concerns and stabilize production sentiment.

    5.  In the 1952 water disaster figures, mountain floods accounted for a large proportion. Because mountain floods are sudden and fierce, it is difficult to guard against them. In addition to flooding land, they have also caused significant losses of life, housing, and livestock in some areas. This serious disaster is difficult to completely avoid before soil and water conservation work and mountain flood prevention measures achieve widespread results. However, it is entirely possible to reduce losses by raising vigilance and making possible preparations. Local governments at all levels should conduct necessary publicity and education work in all areas prone to mountain floods in advance, and water conservancy agencies at all levels should provide timely weather forecasts to raise public awareness and avoid avoidable losses. In addition, typhoons and storms occur every year, so this year's typhoon prevention work, in addition to the Central Flood Control Headquarters and the Central Meteorological Observatory issuing timely warnings, all coastal and lakeside areas should maintain close contact with relevant meteorological observatories to strengthen prevention; however, special attention should be paid to unifying forecasts, and striving for accuracy in time and location, so as to effectively prevent them.

    6. Regarding the guarantee of flood control, all localities should proceed from reality, and based on the achievements of the fundamental treatment projects or annual repair projects of each river, propose the water level and corresponding flow rate for each river that can be guaranteed not to cause floods this year as the minimum goal of struggle. Temporary measures must also be planned in advance for floods that may exceed the guaranteed water level, in order to reduce disasters. For areas that have implemented drainage projects this year, a guarantee task should be proposed to prevent waterlogging under what amount of rainfall.

    7. Regarding the use of flood control funds, according to understanding, some localities have improperly spent funds in the past, using them for non-flood control expenditures, which is incorrect. The principle of special funds for special use must be followed, and spending must be economized. Final accounts must be reported after the flood season. Flood control materials that have been transferred or borrowed should be recovered or replenished as soon as possible, properly stored regularly, and properly handled after the flood season to avoid unnecessary waste and losses.

    8. Other pre-flood season preparations, such as strengthening flood reporting and strengthening organizational publicity, should be vigorously carried out based on past experience. In various specific tasks, the spirit of the struggle against bureaucracy must be resolutely implemented, and the phenomenon of coercion, illegal discipline, and neglect of the lives of the masses must be strictly prevented in the work of mobilizing the masses.

    It is hoped that the flood control agencies in all regions and river basins will earnestly study and implement the above.

    中央防汛总指挥部
    一九五三年防汛工作指示
    现在长江以南各河流已进入汛期，其他地区河流的汛期亦即将到来。为了保证今年农业的增产及保证人民生活、工矿、交通的安全，今年的防汛工作，除继续执行一九五一年中央人民政府政务院“关于加强防汛工作的指示”和历年防汛指示的精神以外，兹特提出下列几点，希各地根据具体情况研究执行：
    一、提高警惕，严防麻痹大意。三年以来，我们对全国河流已经进行了初步的治理，今年又继续进行了许多工作。这些都将给今年的防汛工作提供有利的条件；但是必须指出，消除我国水患的斗争是一个长期的、复杂的、艰巨的任务，内涝的灾害，尤非短期所能完全解除。因此，我们对过去的成绩不能做过高的估价，对今年的防汛工作，不能有任何盲目乐观疏忽大意的思想。必须认识，三年来全国水灾的逐渐减少，水利工程固然是起了一定的作用，但是三年以来除个别流域外，大部地区没有特大的雨量和没有发生异常洪水等自然条件还是重要的一面。我们必须正视这一现实情况，从思想上和工作上作好各种准备，这是决定我们能否战胜今年洪水的重要关键，否则，我们将在严重情况下张慌失措，无能为力，造成不应有的损失。各级领导机关必须向干部、向群众进行教育，正确地估计现实情况，认真地做好防汛准备工作。
    二、在反官僚主义斗争的基础上，根据设计、施工各方面暴露出来的问题和群众提出来的意见，各级水利部门应即会同有关部门，组织足够力量，对重要堤防、海塘与控制工程做一次系统的深入的检查。在检查堤防、海塘时，不仅应注意表面上容易发觉的现象和局部的缺点，例如堤身高度、坡度是否合乎标准，各种缺口是否很好堵闭，裂缝、浪窝、雨淋沟已否整修，险工、护岸埽坝有无垫陷、腐朽，新堤新险是否有人负责防守，河床内行水障碍已否铲除等等；而且必须注意检查堤防内部隐患，了解河滩的变化和大溜移动的情况，据以通盘考虑现有河道、堤防、海塘能否抵御可能发生的洪水及大潮。在检查蓄洪工程及各种闸坝涵洞时，首先应检查有无专人负责管理，或现有管理人员是否熟悉本工程的作用和运用方法，同时也要周密检查建筑物本身有无损坏，特别要注意有无渗漏或淘刷等情况。闸门和开关机械应注意启闭是否灵活，并在检查中试行启闭。在系统的深入的检查当中，发现的缺点和问题应及时加以解决，并责成一定单位负责改进。
    三、在检查堤防工作上，除上述一般检查外，应大力推行黄河大堤的钻探办法。三年来黄河大堤钻探工作，已取得了巨大成绩。据统计，共钻三千六百万眼，发现洞穴六万零六百五十个，均经及时进行了修补，对巩固黄河大堤，起了巨大的作用。一九五二年广东、江西等省聘请黄河钻探工作人员在当地进行传习试验，都行之有效，说明这一先进经验不论在我国南方或北方，一般是可以适用的；可是至今仍有若干地区尚未足够重视，未能很好组织推广这一办法。为了作好今年的防汛工作，各级领导机关应重视这一先进经验，按照广东和江西的作法，有重点的加以推广。在汛前对重要河流的重要堤防，运用钻探办法进行一次检查修补，这将对巩固堤防和加强防汛效能有极大作用。
    四、必须注意蓄洪、分洪等工程的运用。三年来我们作了许多控制洪水的工程，在汛期中对这些工程的管理与运用，应特别注意。这对防汛工作的成败，关系很大。因此，所有带有关键性的及大的控制洪水的工程，其管理人员事前都必须进行充分的训练并做好一切准备工作。已经进行根治的河流，其相互联系的各种工程如何配合应用，才能对削减洪峰、排除积水起最大的效果，也必须明确加以规定，作到心中有数，以免临时措施不当，招致不应有的损失。一般涵闸的管理，都应规定专人负责，在检查时，如发现漏水或损坏现象，必须及时进行修补；在汛期并应不分昼夜地严密防守，使之充分发挥作用。凡是准备蓄洪的地区，必须事前向群众讲明，不能隐瞒，同时要进行深入的宣传，讲清小利服从大利的道理，对于因蓄洪遭受损失的群众，亦应事先规定补偿办法，并向群众宣布，以解除顾虑，安定生产情绪。
    五、在一九五二年的水灾数字中，山洪为灾占很大比重。因为山洪猛烈，猝不及防，除淹没土地外，有些地区并且造成人口、房屋、牲畜的重大损失。这一严重灾害，在水土保持工作及防止山洪措施未收到广泛效果以前，很难完全避免。但是如能提高警惕，并做好可能的准备，减少损失，则是完全可能的。各级地方政府应在所有易发山洪的地区事先进行必要的宣传教育工作，各级水利机关要及时地供给气象预报，使群众提高警惕，以避免可能避免的损失。此外台风、风暴历年都要发生，因此今年防台风工作，除中央防汛总指挥部与中央气象台及时联系发出警报之外，所有各沿海与滨湖地区均应与有关气象台保持密切联系，以加强防范；惟应特别注意，预报必须统一，时间、地点力求准确，以便有效的防止。
    六、关于防汛的保证问题，各地应从实际出发，根据各个河流根治工程或岁修工程达到的成果，提出今年每个河流可以保证不发生水灾的水位及其相应的流量，做为最低限度的奋斗目标。对于可能发生的超过保证水位的洪水，亦须预筹临时措施，以求缩小灾害。对于今年做了防涝排水工程的地区，则应规定在多大的雨量情况下，提出不发生涝灾的保证任务。
    七、关于防汛经费的使用问题，根据了解，过去有的地方开支不当，用于非防汛的开支很多，这是不对的，必须遵照专款专用的原则，撙节使用。汛后并须造报决算。关于防汛器材已经移用借用的，应尽速收回或补充，经常妥为保管，汛期过后并要妥善处理，以免发生不应有的浪费与损失。
    八、其他汛前准备工作，如加强报汛工作，加强组织宣传等工作，都应根据过去已有经验，大力进行。在各种具体工作中尤须切实贯彻反官僚主义斗争的精神，严防在动员群众工作中发生强迫命令、违法乱纪及忽视群众生活的现象。
    以上望各地区、各流域的防汛机关，切实研究执行。
                        五月六日
