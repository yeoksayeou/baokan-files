Comrades, fellow representatives:

Our financial work has developed in response to the needs of the entire trade union construction.

After the Sixth National Labor Congress, with the restoration of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions—this glorious organization of our working class—the financial work of the trade union also began to be established. At that time, the source of trade union funds was not only membership dues paid by members in accordance with the articles of association adopted by the Sixth National Labor Congress, but also mainly allocations from the enterprise administration or capitalists through agreements between the trade union and the enterprise administration or capitalists. After four years of development, especially after the promulgation of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, the trade union funds allocated by the enterprise administration or capitalists have been further guaranteed by law.

Now, I will give you a simple report on the general revenue and expenditure of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

The general revenue and expenditure of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the past three years:

Revenue

Trade union funds: 556,658,500,000 yuan

A.　Membership dues: 18,180,020,000 yuan in 1951

37,948,225,000 yuan in 1952

(An increase of 109 percent in 1952 compared with 1951)

B.　Other funds: 500,530,005,000 yuan from 1950 to 1952

Cultural and educational funds: 79,715,650,000 yuan in revenue from 1951 to 1952

Labor insurance total fund: 240,072,580,000 yuan in revenue from 1951 to 1952 (excluding direct payments from factories and mines and income from trade union organizations at all levels)

Expenditure

Trade union funds: 461,267,960,000 yuan

A.　International affairs expenses: 56,670,800,000 yuan

B.　Cadre education and publishing expenses: 66,767,630,000 yuan

C.　National trade union agency expenses: 337,829,530,000 yuan

Cultural and educational funds: 61,496,540,000 yuan

Labor insurance total fund: 163,469,910,000 yuan

Balance

Trade union funds: 95,390,540,000 yuan

Cultural and educational funds: 18,219,110,000 yuan

Labor insurance total fund: 76,602,670,000 yuan

From the revenue and expenditure situation, it can be seen that our trade union financial work has the following characteristics:

First, the trade union's financial income is gradually increasing with the recovery and development of production. Due to the development of national construction, the ranks of the working class are constantly expanding, and the wage level is constantly increasing, so that the total wage amount is also constantly increasing. The trade union's financial income is calculated based on the total wage amount, so the increase in the total wage amount will naturally increase the trade union funds. Therefore, the more the national construction moves forward, the more important the trade union financial work becomes. This also demonstrates the unity of the interests of the working class and the interests of the entire country, and demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic system.

From a national perspective, the membership dues of 10 percent of the lower-level trade unions remitted to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions totaled 18.1 billion yuan in 1951, which increased to 37.9 billion yuan in 1952; the total labor insurance fund revenue was 102.2 billion yuan in 1951 and 137.8 billion yuan in 1952, an increase of 34.8 percent; the 10 percent of cultural and educational funds remitted was 34.3 billion yuan in 1951, which reached 45.4 billion yuan in 1952, an increase of 32.4 percent.

Looking at Beijing as a city, the income of various funds is also increasing year by year. Compared with 1950, membership dues income: increased by 0.6 times in 1951 and 3.26 times in 1952. In terms of cultural and educational funds: increased by 4.06 times in 1951 and 10.03 times in 1952.

Second, the expenditure of trade union funds is to use the money of the masses for the cause of the masses, to improve and raise the material and cultural life of the working masses. This situation fully demonstrates the mass character of the trade union financial work, and shows that the trade union financial work must be placed under the supervision of the masses.

Third, the trade union's financial work serves production by improving the material and cultural life of the workers and staff. The workers and staff fully understand from their own personal experience that when production develops, life will be improved. Workers and staff who have stayed in sanatoriums and convalescent homes have greatly improved their labor enthusiasm and health. The holding of collective welfare undertakings has powerfully promoted the improvement of labor productivity.

Some comrades think this way: Why must the trade union have financial work, and why must it have independent financial work? Aren't the working class the masters of the country? Can't government agencies handle the undertakings that the trade union is now holding? This idea is wrong. This idea confuses the mass organization of the working class with the state organs, obliterates the mass character of the trade union organization, and ignores the leading role of the trade union organization between the Party and the working masses. It is true that many undertakings of the trade union are supported by the government, but it is still the cause of the masses themselves. The cause of improving the lives of the working masses, like doing a good job in production, must rely on the masses, must guide the masses to care about and manage their own cause, and must not guide the masses to rely on the government. This is also an aspect of practical communist education. To build the cause of the masses themselves, the masses must manage the funds themselves, establish the independent financial work of the trade union, in order to give play to the initiative of the working class and use a certain amount of money to do more things that the masses need.

It should be admitted that the financial work of the trade union is one of the important parts of the trade union construction, and it is the material guarantee of the entire trade union work.

The trade union's financial work still has the following series of problems at the current stage of development.

First, non-political tendencies. The policy of financial work serving production and serving the masses has not been clear for a long time. The most common manifestations are in the following aspects:

1. From the leading comrades of the trade union to the financial cadres, they generally regard the financial work of the trade union as a purely technical work, and they only pay attention to "collecting" and "managing" the various funds of the trade union, but not to "using" them, and they do not know that using them well can closely link the trade union organization with the masses.

2. The financial work is isolated from the entire trade union work, forming a phenomenon that the financial work is divorced from the entire trade union work.

3. Managing the part of the trade union funds, but not managing or managing less the part of the enterprise funds; managing the supply of cadres, but not managing or caring about the workers' demands for collective undertakings and the progress of collective undertakings. For example, in the past few financial meetings or other meetings to discuss issues related to financial work, they mostly focused on the debate on the number of cadres, and rarely reflected and discussed the demands and wishes of the masses.

4. The trade union has accumulated a lot of money, but whenever it involves holding undertakings, it reaches out to the government or the enterprise administration for money.

5. What the money is collected for is not publicized or explained to the masses; how the money is used is not discussed with the masses, and opinions are not solicited, but only subjective decisions are made; after the money is used, accounts are not reported to the masses, and attention is not paid to obtaining the supervision of the masses.

Second, there is a lack of unified management methods and management systems for national enterprise funds, forming countless ideas, and thus creating a phenomenon of a large accumulation of funds.

The lack of ideas on the part of the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is manifested in the fact that it only knows the situation of the funds and undertakings managed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions itself, but does not have complete figures on the revenue and expenditure of cultural and educational, labor insurance, and other funds and the situation of holding undertakings nationwide. Because we have countless ideas, we cannot formulate a clear policy for holding undertakings, and we cannot make practical undertaking plans. Therefore, there is a great deal of blindness in the holding of various undertakings, and the expenditure of enterprise funds is very chaotic.

As for the accumulation of various funds by trade union organizations at all levels across the country, according to incomplete statistics in March this year, it totaled 862.7 billion yuan.

Originally, accumulating a part of the funds cannot be regarded as an error in financial work. Under certain conditions, in order to hold some large undertakings, accumulating funds is not only possible but also necessary. But our current situation is blind accumulation, not planned accumulation. Moreover, we are not yet at the time to accumulate funds, because we have not held enough undertakings. Our policy should be to focus on solving the current needs of the masses. Under this situation, it should be admitted that accumulating so much funds is inappropriate.

Third, there is a lack of democratic management system and mass supervision in financial work.

The phenomenon of not publishing accounts regularly and not reporting revenue and expenditure to the masses still exists. The masses reflect that "they only see the trade union collecting money, but they do not see the trade union reporting accounts"... expressing dissatisfaction with the trade union's financial work. Wherever the revenue and expenditure of funds are disclosed and the supervision of the masses is accepted, the workers express satisfaction, the trade union work is also carried out smoothly, and it plays a great role in promoting the workers' enthusiasm for production. There are still many such cases.

Fourth, there is a lack of a set of scientific and practical financial system, there are no institutions and full-time cadres in charge of enterprise funds, and there is a phenomenon of no one being responsible for enterprise funds, leaving loopholes for corruption and waste. Many such facts were revealed in the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements, but they have not been completely eliminated so far.

In establishing the financial system, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also made a serious subjective mistake, which was specifically manifested in the implementation of vertical management too early, too much, and too quickly; too many and too many kinds of systems, some of which were both cumbersome and complex and very impractical, and it was difficult to implement them at the grassroots level; although some of them were relatively complete, many cadres could not understand them, and the masses could not understand them even more, so that they suspected that the financial cadres were deliberately making trouble. This approach was not in line with the development of the national trade union work at that time and the foundation of the financial work, and thus caused certain difficulties in the work at that time and the work in all aspects was not in sync.

In short, it can be seen from the above series of existing problems that we have not managed our household affairs well, and we have failed the entrustment of the working class of the whole country. In particular, the fact that a large amount of funds has been accumulated has aroused the dissatisfaction of some of the workers. We should sincerely accept criticism. The lack of experience is of course one aspect of the reason for not managing household affairs well, but the more important reason is that, starting from the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, there is a lack of consistent concern for the trade union financial work, and a lack of regular political leadership and ideological leadership from top to bottom. The main reasons for this are as follows:

1. It is the influence of the long-term supply system, accustomed to relying on the government to manage all aspects of life, not accustomed to combining with the masses and mobilizing the masses to manage their own undertakings.

2. It is to treat the cause of the working class of the collectiveistic large-scale production with the views of peasants and small producers, so they accumulate a lot of money and do not know how to do things for the masses.

The leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions should bear the main responsibility for the fact that these problems existing in the trade union financial work have not been overcome in a timely manner. Although many problems were revealed in the Three Antis and Five Antis movements, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, our honorary chairman, gave specific instructions at the joint meeting of the trade union chairmen of the large administrative regions in July last year, the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions began to pay attention to this work and made some regulations, but because some old and impractical regulations were not changed at that time, the problem was not completely solved in reality, so we should make a profound review of the bureaucratism in financial work.

In order to adapt to the requirements of the trade union work during the national construction period, the trade union financial work must be greatly improved:

First, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological leadership over the financial work of trade union organizations at all levels. First of all, it is necessary to make all trade union cadres clearly realize that the financial work of the trade union is by no means a purely technical work, but a complex political work with great significance. The policy of financial work is to serve the entire trade union construction, to serve production, and to serve the masses.

Under this policy, we must truly achieve "collecting well," "managing well," and "using well."

"Collecting well," "managing well," and "using well" are three in one.

The purpose of "collecting" and "managing" is to "use." If it is not used well or cannot be used, it must not be collected well or cannot be collected, because the members pay membership dues for their own cause; if it is used well and used appropriately, the members will be happy to pay, which can make the trade union closely contact the masses, improve the masses' trust in their own organization, and can also give play to the workers' enthusiasm for production. For example, Gao Zhenxi, an old worker who recuperated in the Qixin Yanghui Factory's spare-time sanatorium, said: "My poor health was caused in the era of the reactionary Kuomintang. The puppet trade union not only did not care, but also helped the reactionary Kuomintang oppress the workers; today's trade union truly represents the workers, and takes care of us workers in every way. I can only recuperate well, do a good job in production, and repay Chairman Mao." For example, the production exhibition held by the Beijing Laboring People's Cultural Palace is called "technical school" and "knack classroom" by the workers. In order to study the "mutter" of the countersunk screw, Yang Shouyan, a worker of the trolley company, visited it five or six times in a row; Feng Zicheng, a worker of the 11th factory, further studied the multi-knife multi-blade and high-speed cutting method after visiting, and the output of the axle die was increased from 50 per day in the past to 150. This shows that using money to do a good job in the trade union's cause is of great significance to improving labor productivity.

How can it be used well? First of all, there must be a plan—an undertaking plan and a financial plan. Without a plan, the financial work will not have any constructive and positive significance, and it will not be possible to play the role of material guarantee for the entire trade union construction.

Second, through the rectification of financial work that has already begun, lay the foundation for the realization of unified and centralized management of trade union funds across the country and further move towards independent self-sufficiency of funds. The rectification of the current financial work should start from the following aspects:

1. Rectify ideology: It is necessary to fight against the tendencies of localism and economism in financial work and the ideology of the supply system; it is necessary to fight against the bureaucratism of the leadership; it is necessary to recognize the difference between the financial work of serving the broad masses of workers and the general affairs work of serving the agency cadres; it is necessary to establish correct views on financial work in order to achieve ideological unity on financial work. Without a consistent ideological foundation, the construction and improvement of financial work is impossible.

2. Rectify the organizational system: 1. Establish and improve the financial institutions of trade union organizations at all levels, strengthen the management of enterprise funds, establish special management institutions or full-time cadres for enterprise funds, and resolutely overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible and each doing their own thing. 2. Establish a set of practical, simple and easy-to-use scientific financial system, resolutely overcome the phenomenon of countless ideas and being divorced from the masses, and reform those impractical formalistic old systems and regulations.

3. Rectify the funds: First of all, we must start from the aspect of use. On the one hand, we must use the currently accumulated funds on the problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved, distinguishing between the importance and urgency, and consulting with the masses. We must resolutely oppose the subjective and irresponsible attitude of accumulating but not using or using improperly. On the other hand, we must also establish a set of practical and feasible revenue and expenditure plans and budget and final account systems through summarizing past experience, so that we can reasonably use the funds in the future.

Third, strengthen the collective leadership of the trade union committee over the financial work, and report accounts to the masses regularly to obtain the supervision of the masses. Oppose the style of not consulting with the masses when using money, not reporting accounts to the masses after using money, and being economically undemocratic. Strictly enforce financial discipline and eliminate all kinds of corruption and waste. Truly ensure that every penny is used for the welfare of production and the welfare of the workers and staff.

    关于工会财务工作的报告
    （一九五三年五月三日在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上的报告）
    栗再温各位代表、各位同志：
    我们的财务工作，是随着整个工会建设的需要而发展起来了。
    第六次全国劳动大会以后，随着中华全国总工会——这一光荣的工人阶级自己的组织的恢复，工会的财务工作也开始建立起来。当时工会的经费来源除按第六次全国劳动大会所通过的章程由会员交纳会费外，主要是经过工会与企业行政方面或资方的协议，由企业行政方面或资方拨付。经过四年来的发展，特别是中华人民共和国工会法颁布以后，由企业行政方面或资方拨付的工会经费更得到了法律的保障。
    现在，我把中华全国总工会的各项经费收支的大概情况向同志们作简单的报告。
    三年来中华全国总工会各项经费收支情况：
    收入
    工会经费：五千五百六十六亿五千八百五十万元
    甲、会　费：一九五一年收入一百八十一亿八千零二十万元
    一九五二年收入三百七十九亿四千八百二十五万元
    （一九五二年比一九五一年增加了百分之一百零九）
    乙、其他经费：一九五○年——一九五二年五千零五亿三千零五万元
    文化教育经费：一九五一年——一九五二年收入七百九十七亿一千五百六十五万元
    劳动保险总基金：一九五一年——一九五二年收入二千四百亿零七千二百五十八万元（不包括厂矿企业直接支付的和工会各级组织收入的）
    支出
    工会经费：四千六百十二亿六千七百九十六万元
    甲、国际事业费：五百六十六亿七千零八十万元
    乙、干部教育和出版事业费：六百六十七亿六千七百六十三万元
    丙、全国工会机关经费：三千三百七十八亿二千九百五十三万元
    文化教育经费：六百十四亿九千六百五十四万元
    劳动保险总基金：一千六百三十四亿六千九百九十一万元
    结存
    工会经费：九百五十三亿九千零五十四万元
    文化教育经费：一百八十二亿一千九百十一万元
    劳动保险总基金：七百六十六亿零二百六十七万元
    从收支情况中，可以看出我们工会财务工作，具有如下的特点：
    第一、工会的经费收入是在随着生产的恢复与发展而逐渐增加着。由于国家建设事业的发展，工人阶级队伍不断地扩大，工资水平不断地提高，从而工资总额也在不断地增加着。工会的经费收入都是按工资总额计算的，工资总额增加、工会经费也自然要增加。所以国家建设愈向前进步，工会财务工作就愈显得重要。在这一点上，也表现着工人阶级的利益和整个国家利益的一致，表现着人民民主制度的优越性。
    从全国范围来看，一九五一年下级工会上解全国总工会百分之十的会费共一百八十一亿元，一九五二年就增加到三百七十九亿元；劳动保险总基金一九五一年收入一千零二十二亿元，一九五二年收入一千三百七十八亿元，增加了百分之三四点八；文教经费上解百分之十的部分，一九五一年为三百四十三亿元，一九五二年即达到四百五十四亿元，增加了百分之三二点四。
    再拿北京市一个市来看，各种经费的收入也是逐年增加的，与一九五○年比较，会费收入：一九五一年增加了零点六倍，一九五二年增加了三点二六倍。文教费方面：一九五一年增加了四点零六倍，一九五二年增加了一○点零三倍。
    第二、工会经费的开支，是将群众的钱用于群众的事业，以改善和提高工人群众的物质生活及文化生活，这一情况充分表明了工会财务工作的群众性，说明工会财务工作必须放在群众的监督之下。
    第三、工会的财务工作是通过改善职工群众物质和文化生活而服务于生产的。职工群众从自己切身的体验当中完全懂得，生产发展了，生活就得到改善，凡是住过休养所、疗养院……的职工，劳动热情和健康程度都大为提高，集体福利事业的举办，有力地推动劳动生产率的提高。
    有些同志这样想：工会为什么一定要有财务工作，而且一定要有独立的财务工作呢？难道工人阶级不是国家的主人吗？难道政府机关不可以办理现在工会所举办的事业吗？这种想法是不对的。这种想法是把工人阶级的群众组织与国家机关混为一谈，是抹煞了工会组织的群众性，是忽视了工会组织是党和工人群众之间的引带作用的。不错，工会的许多事业是由政府支持的，然而它仍不失为群众自己的事业。改善工人群众生活的事业与搞好生产
    一样，必须依靠群众，必须引导群众自己关心和经营自己的事业，而不能引导群众依赖政府，这也是实际的共产主义教育的一个方面。而要建设群众自己的事业，必须由群众自己来掌管经费，建立工会的独立的财务工作，以便发挥工人阶级的积极性，利用一定数量的钱，作出更多的群众所需要的事情。
    应该承认，工会的财务工作是工会建设中的重要部分之一，它是整个工会工作的物质保证。
    工会的财务工作，在发展过程中的现阶段还存在下面一系列的问题。
    第一、非政治倾向。财务工作为生产服务、为群众服务的方针长期不明确。最普遍地表现在以下几个方面：
    一、从工会的领导同志到财务干部，普遍地把工会的财务工作看成单纯的技术工作，对于掌握工会各项经费，只注意“收”和“管”而不注意“用”，不知道用得好就可以密切工会组织和群众的联系。
    二、把财务工作从整个工会工作中孤立起来，形成财务工作与整个工会工作脱节的现象。
    三、管了工会经费部分，而不管或少管事业经费部分；管了干部的供给，不管或不关心工人群众对集体事业的要求和集体事业的进展情况。比如过去几次财务会议或其它会议上讨论有关财务工作问题时，多集中于干部人数编制的争论，而很少反映和讨论群众的要求和愿望。
    四、工会积存很多钱，但一涉及举办事业，就伸手向政府或企业行政要钱。
    五、收钱作甚么，不向群众宣传、解释；钱怎样用，不和群众商量，不征求群众意见，只凭主观决定；钱用了之后，不向群众报帐，不重视取得群众的监督。
    第二、对全国事业经费，缺乏统一的管理办法和管理制度，形成心中无数，因而产生大量积存经费的现象。
    全国总工会领导上对于财务工作的心中无数，表现在仅仅知道全国总工会自己所管的经费和事业情况，而对于全国范围内的文教、劳动保险等经费收支情况和举办事业的情况却未掌握完整数字。我们由于心中无数，就不能制订明确的举办事业的方针，不能作出切合实际的事业计划，因此，在各项事业的举办中就普遍存在着很大的盲目性，事业费的开支很混乱。
    至于全国工会各级组织各种经费的积存，据今年三月份不完整的统计，共达八千六百二十七亿元。
    本来积累一部分经费，不能算是财务工作上的错误。在一定条件下为了举办一些大的事业，积累经费不但是可以的而且是必要的。但我们今天的情况是盲目的积存，而非有计划的积累。而且我们今天还不到积累经费的时候，因为我们举办的事业还不够多。我们的方针，应该是以解决群众当前的需要为主。在这种情况下，积存如许经费，应该承认是不妥当的。
    第三、缺乏财务工作上的民主管理制度和群众监督。
    不定期公布帐目，不向群众报告收支情况的现象还是存在的。群众反映“只见工会收钱，不见工会报帐”……对工会的财务工作表示不满。凡是公开经费收支，接受群众的监督的地方，工人就表示满意，工会工作也开展得顺利，对工人生产积极性起着很大的推动作用。这种事例也还是不少的。
    第四、缺乏一套科学的切合实际的财务制度，没有专管事业经费的机构和专责干部，在事业经费上形成都管都不管的无人负责现象，为贪污、浪费留下了空子。“三反”“五反”中揭发了不少这样的事实，但至今尚未完全杜绝。
    在建立财务制度上，全国总工会也曾犯过严重的主观主义的错误，其具体表现为实行垂直管理过早、过多、过快；为各种制度过繁过多，其中有一些既繁琐又复杂很不切合实际，在基层很难行得通；其中有一些虽然比较完整，但许多干部又看不懂，群众更看不懂，以致怀疑财务干部故意捣鬼。这种做法，与当时全国工会工作的发展情况和财务工作的基础是不相适合的，因而造成了当时工作上的一定困难和各方面的工作不合拍。
    总之，从以上一系列存在着的问题中可以看出，我们还没有管好家务，有负全国工人阶级的委托。特别是大量积存经费的事实，引起了一部分工人群众的不满，我们应该诚恳地接受批评。没有管好家务的原因，缺乏经验当然是一方面，而更主要的是自全国总工会领导上起，缺乏对工会财务工作的一贯的关怀，缺乏自上而下的经常的政治领导和思想领导。其所以如此，主要原因是由于以下几点：
    一、是长期供给制度的影响，习惯于一切生活依靠政府来管，不惯于结合群众、发动群众经营自己的事业。
    二、是用农民、小生产者的观点，对待集体主义的大生产的工人阶级的事业，故积存很多钱，不会给群众办事。
    在工会财务工作中存在这些问题并未能及时地加以克服，全国总工会领导上要负主要的责任。在三反、五反运动中，虽曾经揭发了很多问题，去年七月大行政区工会主席联席会议时，我们的名誉主席刘少奇同志又给了具体的指示，全国总工会领导上开始重视了这一工作，并作了某些规定，但由于当时对某些旧的不切合实际的规定并未加改变，所以实际上并没有完全解决问题，所以我们对于财务工作中的官僚主义，是应该作深刻检讨的。
    为了适应国家建设时期工会工作的要求，工会财务工作必须大大改进：
    第一、必须加强对工会各级组织的财务工作的思想领导。首先要使全体工会干部明确认识，工会的财务工作绝不是单纯的技术工作，而是复杂的有着重大意义的政治工作。财务工作的方针是为整个工会建设服务，为生产服务，为群众服务。
    在这一方针下，真正地作到“收好”、“管好”、“用好”。
    “收好”、“管好”、“用好”是三位一体的。
    “收”与“管”的目的是为了“用”。如果用不好或者不会用，则一定收不好或者收不到，因为会员缴纳会费，是为了他自己的事业；如果用得好，用得恰当，会员就乐于缴纳，就可以使工会密切地联系群众，提高群众对自己的组织的信任，也就可以发挥工人的生产积极性。例如：启新洋灰厂业余休养所休养的老工友高振喜说：“我身体不好是在反动国民党时代造成的，伪工会不但不管，还帮助反动国民党压迫工人；今天的工会才是真正代表工人的，对咱们工人处处照顾周到。我只有好好的休养，搞好生产，来报答毛主席。”又例如北京市劳动人民文化宫举办的生产展览会，工人把它称为“技术学校”、“窍门课堂”。电车公司的工人杨寿延为了研究闷螺丝的“闷子”，一连参观五、六次；十
    一工厂的工人冯子成参观后，进一步学习了多刀多刃与高速切削法，镟轴模产量由过去一天五十个提高到一百五十个。这说明用钱办好工会的事业，对提高劳动生产率有极大意义。
    怎样才能用好呢？首先是要有计划——事业计划和财务计划。没有计划的财务工作就不会有任何建设性的积极意义，就不可能起到整个工会建设的物质保证作用。
    第二、通过目前已经开始的财务工作的整顿，为实现全国工会经费统一集中管理和进一步走向经费独立自给打下基础。整顿目前的财务工作，要从下列几方面着手：
    一、整顿思想：要和财务工作上的本位主义、经济主义的倾向和供给制的思想进行斗争；要和领导上的官僚主义进行斗争；要认识为广大工人群众服务的财务工作，与为机关干部服务的总务工作有区别；要建立正确的财务工作的观点，以达到对财务工作的思想上认识上的统一。没有一致的思想基础，财务工作的建设和改进是不可能的。
    二、整顿组织制度：1．建立和健全工会各级组织的财务机构，加强事业费的管理，建立事业费的专管机构或专职干部，坚决克服无人负责、各自为政的现象。2．建立一套切合实际、简便易行的科学的财务制度，坚决克服心中无数、脱离群众的现象，改革那些不切实际的形式主义的旧制度和规定。
    三、整顿经费：首先要从使用方面着手，这里一方面既要把现在积存的经费，分别轻重缓急，通过与群众商量，用在群众迫切要求解决的问题上，坚决反对积而不用或用而不当的主观主义和不负责任的态度；另一方面又要通过总结过去的经验，并建立一套切实可行的收支计划和预决算制度，以便今后合理地使用经费。
    第三、加强工会委员会对财务工作的集体领导，并定期向群众报告帐目，取得群众的监督。反对用钱不和群众商量，用了钱不向群众报帐，经济上不民主的作风。严肃财务纪律，杜绝一切贪污、浪费的弊端。作到真正使每一个钱都用在有益于生产、有益于职工群众的福利事业上。（新华社）
