Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 6th. The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communique on May 6th:

    The two sides' delegations held a meeting on May 6th.

    At the meeting, the other side continued to oppose our side's reasonable and practical proposal to send the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral nations to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue. It also continued to refuse to clarify its own proposition to have neutral nations temporarily take care of those prisoners of war in Korea. Not only that, but the other side retreated a step further, attempting to fundamentally overturn the current negotiation basis of transferring the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral nations, and advocated forcibly detaining the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who are not directly repatriated under the name of "on-the-spot release."

    Our side's chief representative, General Nam Il, solemnly pointed out at the meeting that it was not worth refuting the other side's presentation of such unreasonable claims that our side absolutely could not consider. General Nam Il also pointed out: "The task currently before the two delegations is not to overturn the basis of negotiations that both sides have already expressed agreement on, but to determine the premise of sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral nations based on this basis. Before this premise is determined, specifically nominating neutral nations is not only of no practical significance, but also not respecting the way of neutral nations. Because what kind of task this neutral nation will undertake has not been agreed upon by you and me. If your side's action of nominating neutral nations is not for propaganda, but for seriously resolving the issue, our side believes that your side has no reason to refuse to consult with our side on this issue that needs to be resolved first: sending prisoners of war to neutral nations. Our side believes that sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral nations or keeping them in Korea to be accommodated by neutral nations are two different actual situations that require completely different specific arrangements. Only when this issue is resolved can we beneficially enter into the specific nomination of neutral nations. Our side has consistently advocated sending these prisoners of war to neutral nations and has put forward a complete six-point specific implementation plan, fully explaining our side's proposition. Your side advocates keeping prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated in Korea to be accommodated by neutral nations and has nominated several neutral countries that you consider appropriate. However, your side has consistently failed to clarify some important issues regarding how to accommodate them in Korea. For the past three days, we have been asking your side to clarify your side's proposition, but regrettably, your side has not provided the necessary clarification for your own proposition. Our side believes that your side's attitude is not conducive to the progress of the negotiations."

    The two sides are scheduled to continue holding a delegation meeting on May 7th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 6th. Our correspondent reported that General Nam Il made further consultation efforts on the 5th to promote the armistice negotiations, which had been resumed for ten days. He asked the US representative to clarify their position on how neutral nations would supervise the prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated. US Chief Representative Harrison still insisted on nominating neutral nations while avoiding specific discussions on this issue that hinders the agreement.

    General Nam Il pointed out that neutral nations could be nominated after an agreement was reached on the issue of the mission of neutral nations. The representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides had suggested that neutral nations should supervise the prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated in their territories. The US representative has nominated Pakistan as a neutral nation, but what tasks do they want this neutral nation to perform? There is no answer to this.

    For many days, the US has been obstructing the agreement, refusing to send prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral nations where they can be free from the influence of the detaining party. Harrison has insisted on continuing to detain them in Korea, so that they will continue to be influenced by the detaining party and continue to live in an environment of suspicion and fear.

    General Nam Il asked Harrison to clarify some of the following practical issues: What specific steps will your side take to eliminate the military control of the detaining party in order to free the prisoners of war from the influence of the detaining party? How does your side intend to enable the neutral nation you have nominated to effectively supervise such prisoners of war? Specifically, do you intend to ask the neutral nation to send its armed forces to Korea to supervise the prisoners of war? How will you maintain order in the prisoner of war camps?

    Harrison avoided answering, only vaguely saying: "Supervision can be implemented effectively and fairly." But how to implement it? There is no answer to this. Harrison replied when further questioned:

    "I have nothing more to say."

    Harrison's refusal to conduct discussions and clarify the US position confirms the view that Harrison is continuing to insist on nominating neutral nations before an agreement is reached on the issue of the mission of neutral nations, which is clearly for propaganda purposes. This also raises doubts about whether the US has the sincerity to resolve the prisoner of war issue through negotiation.

    These doubts are further increased by Harrison's repeated hints to interrupt the negotiations. The armistice negotiations, which have lasted for nearly two years, have shown that threats and intimidation are of no use in negotiations conducted on an equal footing between the two sides. As General Nam Il previously pointed out, in negotiations conducted on an equal footing between the two sides, only consultations and discussions at the meeting are the proper way to resolve issues. So far, Harrison has not shown that he wants to solve the problem in this way.

### 美方继续拒绝具体讨论中立国任务问题  南日大将指出美方态度无助于谈判的进展

    美方继续拒绝具体讨论中立国任务问题
    南日大将指出美方态度无助于谈判的进展
    【新华社开城六日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月六日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团五月六日举行会议。
    会上对方既继续反对我方所提出的把不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的解决整个战俘问题的合理而又实际的建议；又继续拒绝明确说明对方自己所提出的由中立国来朝鲜临时看管那些战俘的主张。不但如此，对方反而倒退一步，企图根本推翻将不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国的现行谈判的基础，主张在“就地释放”的名义下，强迫扣留不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军的被俘人员。
    我方首席代表南日大将在会上严正指出，对方提出这种明知我方所绝对不能考虑的毫无道理的主张，是不值得予以驳斥的。南日大将并指出：“目前摆在双方代表团面前的任务，不是推翻双方已经表示同意的谈判基础，而是根据这一基础，确定将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的前提。在这个前提确定之前，具体提名中立国，不仅没有实际意义，而且也非尊重中立国之道。因为这个中立国将担负何种任务，你我双方尚未取得一致意见。如果你方提名中立国的行动，不是为了宣传，而是为了认真解决问题的话，我方认为你方就没有理由拒绝来和我方商定把战俘送到中立国去的这个首先需要解决的问题。我方认为将不直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去，还是将他们留在朝鲜由中立国收容是两种不同的实际情况，需要完全不同的具体安排。只有将这个问题解决了，才能够有益地进入具体的中立国提名。我方一贯主张将这些战俘送到中立国去，并提出了完整的六点具体实施方案，充分地说明了我方的主张。你方主张将不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜，由中立国收容，并提名了几个你方认为适当的中立国家。但你方却一直没有对如何在朝鲜收容他们的一些重要问题给予澄清。三天以来，我们一直要求你方澄清你方的主张，但很遗憾地你方并未对你方自己的主张提出应有的澄清。我方认为你方这种态度，是无助于谈判的进展的。”
    双方定于五月七日继续举行代表团大会。
    【新华社开城六日电】本社特派记者报道，南日大将在五日作了进一步的协商努力，以促进复会已达十天的停战谈判。他要求美方代表阐明他们对于中立国如何看管不直接遣返的战俘的问题所持的主张。美方首席代表哈利逊还是坚持提名中立国，而避免对妨碍协议的这个问题进行具体的讨论。
    南日大将指出，在对中立国的任务问题获得协议后，是可以提名中立国的。朝中方面的代表曾经建议中立国应在它的领土上看管不直接遣返的战俘。美方代表已提名巴基斯坦为中立国，但是他们想要这个中立国执行什么任务呢？这是没有答案的。
    许多天来，美方一直阻挠协议，拒绝把不直接遣返的战俘送到可以摆脱拘留一方的影响的中立国去。哈利逊一直坚持把他们继续拘留在朝鲜，这样，他们就会继续受到拘留一方的影响，继续生活在疑惧的环境中。
    南日大将要哈利逊阐明以下的一些实际问题：你方将采取什么具体步骤，来取消拘留一方的军事管制，以便使战俘摆脱拘留一方的影响？你方打算怎样使你方所提名的中立国有效地看管这种战俘？具体地说，你方是不是打算请中立国派遣它的武装部队到朝鲜来看管战俘？你方将如何在战俘营中维持秩序？
    哈利逊避免回答，只是模糊地说：“看管是能够有效地和公正地执行的。”但是如何执行？这是没有答案的。哈利逊在受到进一步的追问时回答说：
    “我再没有什么话可说了。”
    哈利逊拒绝进行讨论和阐明美方的主张，这证实了人们的一种看法：哈利逊继续坚持在就中立国的任务问题获致协议以前提名中立国，这明明是怀着宣传的目的。这还使人怀疑美方是否有诚意通过协商的方式来解决战俘问题。
    由于哈利逊屡次暗示要中断谈判，就更加增加了人们的这种怀疑。进行了近两年的停战谈判表明：在双方在平等基础上进行的谈判中，威胁和恫吓是没有什么用处的。正如南日大将先前所指出的，在双方在平等基础上进行的谈判中，只有会议上的协商和讨论，才是解决问题的正当方式。到目前为止，哈利逊还没有表明过他想按照这种方式来解决问题。
