    Wounded and Sick Volunteers Repatriated to Sanatoriums in the Motherland's Rear
    (Xinhua News Agency) The wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who were repatriated on the 14th, have left Andong and have now arrived at a rear hospital in Northeast China for treatment. When the sick and wounded arrived at a certain place, the local people carried stretchers and drove carts to pick them up. Local government leaders and responsible comrades of the Communist Party Committee also brought condolences to express their sympathy.
    The hospital where the repatriated wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army live is by the river, near a peaceful grassland with beautiful scenery, and the wards are well-lit. They have all had physical examinations, and the hospital director and doctors check the wards every day, conducting consultations and treatments in a timely manner. In order to quickly restore their health, the hospital has also formulated menus according to the different physical conditions of the sick and wounded, and they now have nutritious foods such as milk, eggs, chicken, fish, meat, vegetables, and fruits every day. The sick and wounded are most interested in the motherland's books and pictorials, and they are extremely excited about the motherland's economic construction.
    Many sick and wounded soldiers wrote letters to thank the people of the motherland for their warm care and concern. In their letters, they wrote: "We have returned from the hell on earth to the embrace of the motherland and received such kind care, which makes us feel even more the greatness and loveliness of the motherland."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 17th] The last batch of ninety-eight repatriated wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returned to the motherland successively on the 15th and 16th. After emergency medical treatment and rest in a hospital in Andong, they were transferred to sanatoriums in the rear of the motherland.

    许多病伤人员写信感谢祖国人民的热情照顾和慰问。他们在信中写道：“我们自人间地狱回到祖国的怀抱，受到这样亲切的照顾，愈益感到祖国的伟大和可爱。”
