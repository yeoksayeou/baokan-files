The article "Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Does Not Understand the Situation Below and Excessively Issues Official Documents" published in the People's Daily on April 25th gave us great enlightenment and provided immense help in inspecting and improving our work. This has made us more deeply aware of the serious harm of excessively issuing official documents. From July to the end of last year, the Tangshan suburban work committee received 72 official documents issued by our department; recently, after our own inspection, the number of documents issued has not decreased significantly compared to the past. In the first three months of this year alone, we issued 352 official documents; of these, 46 were submitted to higher authorities, 80 were sent to directly affiliated units of the department, and the remaining 226 (including 92 informal letters) were sent to various special districts, counties, and cities. Thus, each special district, county, and city received an average of 2.5 documents per day. These documents were mostly urging the submission of typical materials, reporting on the current agricultural production movement, and submitting survey forms. This work had to be done through district and village cadres. At that time, we only started from subjective wishes and did not consider the actual situation below, the strength of the workforce, or whether they could complete these cumbersome tasks. Because of the large number of documents issued and the large amount of work arranged, district and village cadres were exhausted and found it difficult to do their work well, often delaying production. We neglected these serious problems. In addition, due to not understanding the actual situation below and planning poorly, work was arranged in a general way, and the quota for selecting model workers was changed repeatedly, leaving the lower levels with no guidance. Our province is vast, and the climate varies greatly from north to south, with different ripening periods for crops; because we made unified arrangements regardless of region, the results were divorced from reality, increasing the difficulties for the lower levels. Comrade Yu Xiang's criticism from Tangshan is correct.

The root cause of the above errors is that this department lacks in-depth and systematic investigation and research work, the work arranged is not practical, and it mostly starts from subjective wishes, with a serious bureaucratic style. At the same time, the work connection between the various departments within the department is not close, each department emphasizes its own work, ignoring the central work; the department's leadership also failed to plan and arrange work comprehensively. The leadership's bureaucracy has contributed to the growth of departmentalism, and at the same time, departmentalism has aggravated the leadership's bureaucracy. We have conducted an inspection on this issue and are determined to overcome serious bureaucracy, decentralization, and red tape in our daily work. In the future, all documents that can be issued or not issued, or that have little effect, will not be issued. Documents that urgently need to be issued will be carefully researched, repeatedly considered, and based on actual conditions, will be made specific according to different regions and different conditions; emphasis will be placed on explaining specific implementation methods; and official document procedures will be simplified to give full play to the effectiveness of official documents, so as to prevent the recurrence of the phenomenon of excessive issuance of official documents.

### 河北省农林厅关于滥发公文的检讨

    河北省农林厅关于滥发公文的检讨
    人民日报四月二十五日发表的“河北省农林厅不了解下情滥发公文”一文，给我们很大启示，对我们检查改进工作有莫大帮助。这使我们更深刻地认识到滥发公文为害的严重性。唐山市郊区工作委员会从去年七月到年底即收到我厅发出的公文七十二件；最近经我们自己检查，发文数字较之过去还未显著减少。仅今年一、二、三月份即发出公文三百五十二件；其中除上报四十六件，发至本厅直属各单位八十件外，其余二百二十六件（内便函九十二件）均发至各专区、县、市。这样，各专区、县、市每天平均要收到二点五件。这些文件又多是催要典型材料、催报当前农业生产运动情况及调查表报等，这些工作都必须通过区、村干部去做。当时我们只是从主观愿望出发，没有考虑到下边实际情况如何，力量如何，能否完成这些繁琐的任务。因为发文件多，布置工作多，使得区村干部疲劳不堪，很难做好工作，经常耽误生产。这些严重问题，却被我们忽略了。此外，由于不了解下边实际情况，计划不周，一般化地布置工作，对评选模范的名额一再变动，使下级无所遵循。我省幅员广大，南北气候相差很远，作物成熟期早晚不同；由于我们不分地区统一布置，结果脱离实际，给下边增多了困难。唐山市于祥同志的批评都是对的。
    以上错误产生的根源，是本厅深入系统地调查研究工作差，布置工作不切合实际，多从主观愿望出发，有严重的官僚主义作风。同时，厅内各部门间工作联系不密切，各自强调部门工作，忽略中心工作；本厅领导方面也未能通盘计划安排工作。领导方面的官僚主义，助长了部门间的分散主义的滋长，同时分散主义又加重了领导方面的官僚主义。对于这个问题，我们已进行了检查，并决心在日常工作中克服严重的官僚主义、分散主义和文牍主义。今后凡可发可不发或作用不大的文件一律不发，急需下达文件一定经过缜密研究，反复考虑，从实际出发，根据不同地区、不同条件，加以具体化，并着重交代具体执行办法；并要简化公文手续，发挥公文实效，以杜绝滥发公文现象再次发生。
