Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th. Our special correspondent reports: The U.S. Chief Representative, Harrison, still avoids answering the questions raised by General Nam Il. General Nam Il inquired that if the U.S. representatives genuinely wanted to achieve an armistice in Korea, why did they overturn the basis for resuming negotiations, making an armistice impossible? Harrison could not answer and suggested a three-day recess until May 20th for "administrative reasons."

    Today, in a forceful speech, General Nam Il emphasized the grave and dangerous implications of the U.S. counterproposal to hand over the unwilling-to-be-repatriated Korean prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee government instead of a neutral nation for custody. The Korean and Chinese representatives were prepared to discuss the details, but the U.S. representative "overturned the agreed-upon basis," making a discussion of the major issues impossible. In order to have a serious discussion of the issues facing both sides, the U.S. counterproposal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war must be withdrawn, and the basis for negotiation restored.

    General Nam Il asked: "What reasons do you have for overturning the current basis for negotiation, overturning our basic plan, which you repeatedly expressed agreement with, and overturning the proposal you put forward on April 16th?" Harrison did not answer any of this. The principle for resuming armistice negotiations is: to hand over the prisoners of war who are unwilling to be repatriated to a neutral nation to seek a fair solution to the issue of their repatriation. Harrison also suggested on April 16th that the prisoners of war who are unwilling to be repatriated be handed over to a neutral nation for custody in Korea.

    General Nam Il said that the repeated efforts of the Korean and Chinese side had opened the door to armistice negotiations, but the U.S. side had blocked the door to a Korean armistice without reason. "This is contrary to the peace aspirations of the people of the world."

    Under the cover of propaganda, Harrison undermined the basis for negotiation, insisting that the U.S. counterproposal was "deliberately misunderstood and distorted," and that he had adopted "most" of General Nam Il's eight-point plan. At a time when an agreement was in sight and the last excuse for the U.S. to delay an agreement had been eliminated, there could be no "misunderstanding" of the U.S.'s actions to reverse the negotiations.

    The intentions of Washington, as seen in Harrison's statement at Panmunjom, cannot be misunderstood. General Nam Il said to Harrison: "Korean People's Army prisoners of war and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war are not allowed to be treated differently, and are not allowed to be forcibly detained. Your attempt to divide our side with this absurd proposal is doomed to failure." He warned that this unacceptable demand "is completely inconsistent with your declared 'willingness to achieve an early armistice in Korea.'"

    The only response Harrison could make in the face of the increasing public opinion around the world demanding an immediate armistice in Korea was to re-raise the unfounded issue of 50,000 missing prisoners of war, an old obstructionist tactic that his predecessor, Admiral Joy, had abandoned a year ago—last May. His other response was to read a pre-prepared statement requesting a three-day recess.

    General Nam Il agreed to the recess, which was requested for "administrative reasons." However, when the plenary session reconvenes on May 20th, the world will ask: Why did Washington order the U.S. representative to undermine the basis for the resumed armistice negotiations? Why did Harrison overturn his own proposal, knowingly make demands that could not be accepted, and reverse the negotiations? Harrison cannot avoid answering these questions.

### 美方首席代表无法答复我方严正质问

    美方首席代表无法答复我方严正质问
    【新华社开城十六日电】本社特派记者报道：美方首席代表哈利逊对南日大将提出的问题仍避不作答。南日大将询问，如果美方代表真想在朝鲜达成停战，为什么他们推翻恢复谈判的基础，使停战不可能实现。哈利逊不能作答，而以“行政性的理由”建议休会三天到五月二十日。
    今日，南日大将在强有力的发言中着重指出：美方要求把不直接遣返的朝鲜籍被俘人员，交给李承晚政府而不交给中立国看管的反建议的严重的具有危险的含意。朝中代表准备讨论细则，但是美方代表“推翻了双方已经同意的基础”，使双方对于主要问题的讨论成为不可能”。为了严肃地对双方所面对的问题进行讨论，美方强迫扣留战俘的反建议必须撤回，恢复谈判的基础。
    南日大将问道：“你方有什么理由推翻现行谈判的基础，推翻你方一再表示同意的我方的基本方案，推翻你方在四月十六日提出的建议？”哈利逊都没有答复。停战谈判恢复的原则是：把不直接遣返的战俘交给一个中立国，以便对他们的遣返问题求得公正的解决。哈利逊在四月十六日也建议不直接遣返的战俘交给一个中立国在朝鲜看管。
    南日大将说，朝中方面的多次努力已把停战谈判的大门打开，但是美方却毫无理由地堵住了朝鲜停战的大门。“这是和全世界人民的和平愿望相违背的”。
    哈利逊在宣传的掩护下破坏了进行谈判的基础，硬说美方的反建议被“故意误解和歪曲了”，说他已采纳了南日大将八点方案的“大部分”。正当协议在望和美方拖延取得协议的最后借口被消除的时候，对美方使谈判逆转的行为是不可能有“误解”的。
    由哈利逊在板门店的声明中所看到的华盛顿的意图是不会误解的。南日大将对哈利逊说：“朝鲜人民军的被俘人员和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，不容许予以分别待遇，都不容许予以强迫扣留。你方妄图以你方这一荒谬建议来分化我方是注定了要失败的。”他警告说：这种不能接受的要求是与你方所宣布的“愿意早日获致朝鲜停战的声言是完全不相符合的”。
    哈利逊在全世界要求朝鲜立即停战的日益增加的舆论的面前所可能作出的唯一回答是：再度提出莫须有的五万名失踪的战俘，这是一个陈旧的阻挠办法，这个办法是一年前——去年五月——他的前任乔埃海军上将抛弃的办法。他的另一个回答是：读一份预先准备好的声明，要求休会三天。
    南日大将同意休会，这休会是以“行政原因”要求的。但是，当全体会议在五月二十日复会的时候，全世界人士要问：为什么华盛顿要命令美国代表破坏恢复了的停战谈判的基础呢？为什么哈利逊推翻他自己的建议，明明知道要求不能被接受而又偏偏提出要求来，使谈判逆转呢？哈利逊是不能不回答这些问题的。
