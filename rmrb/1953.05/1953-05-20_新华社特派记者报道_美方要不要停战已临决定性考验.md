Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Reports:
    The Decisive Test of Whether the US Wants a Ceasefire is at Hand
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 19th] (Our Special Correspondent Wu Min reports:) The plenary session of the delegations of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations was originally scheduled to resume on May 20th at Panmunjom. Now, at the request of the chief US representative, Harrison, the session will be adjourned for another five days and resume on May 25th. Our side has agreed to this request, but our side pointed out: "We believe that negotiations should not be prolonged."
    After eight days of adjournment, the delegation plenary session will once again provide an opportunity to test whether Washington truly wants an armistice in Korea. This test is simple, but also decisive. This test will show: whether the US representative will truly accept General Nam Il's eight-point proposal as the basis for an agreement and an immediate ceasefire, abandon their "counter-proposal" to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and the unreasonable restrictions proposed to achieve this goal.
    Before Harrison put forward the "counter-proposal" under the instructions of Tokyo and Washington, Panmunjom had never been so close to a ceasefire. However, Harrison's "counter-proposal" set back the negotiations and destroyed the basis for resuming negotiations. The US "counter-proposal" on May 13th put forward unacceptable demands and unreasonable restrictions, which were condemned by the world and once again showed that the US was delaying and wanted to avoid an armistice that could have been achieved immediately.
    Observers here point out that in order for the negotiations to make progress, the US representative must first restore the basis of the armistice negotiations. These negotiations were resumed on the principle agreed upon by both sides, which is to hand over the prisoners of war not directly repatriated after the armistice to neutral countries for custody in order to fairly resolve their repatriation issue. The US representative must not set back the negotiations with unacceptable demands, because they know that these demands will never be accepted. Observers further point out that Washington must remember that it cannot unilaterally decide the conditions at the negotiating table where both sides participate in negotiations on an equal footing, unless it deliberately does so to prevent the conclusion of an armistice agreement and "hang on" in Korea.
    The record of the armistice negotiations that resumed twenty-three days ago is clear. So far, only the Korean and Chinese side representatives have taken actions to show their sincere hope for a swift armistice in Korea. Their obvious efforts and concessions to dispel the excuses put forward by the US side one after another have already brought the negotiations close to the edge of a resolution. Their eight-point proposal has been welcomed by world public opinion and is considered a solid basis for reaching an agreement on the issue of prisoners of war and a swift armistice. According to this proposal, all prisoners of war will be able to return home quickly, and the Korean War can end immediately. Since the final handling of the prisoner of war issue after the armistice is submitted to a higher-level political conference, this post-armistice issue will not hinder the signing of the armistice agreement.
    The actions of the US representative at Panmunjom have undermined the basis of the negotiations, causing the negotiations to retreat from the edge of a resolution. Their "counter-proposal" is full of complicated details, with the purpose of hindering as many prisoners of war as possible from returning home and avoiding a quick agreement and ceasefire. At the same time as the US side overturned the basis of the negotiations, they carried out serious provocative acts, bombing Andong and other cities and towns in our country, and bombing the Shuifeng Reservoir on the Yalu River.
    Whether Washington will continue to ignore the world's demand for resolving the prisoner of war issue based on the eight-point proposal of the Korean and Chinese representatives remains to be seen. This can be seen in the answers to the following questions after the plenary session resumes:
    (1) Will the US representative insist on overturning the basis of the negotiations, demanding that Korean and Chinese prisoners of war be "released as civilians" in South Korea and handed over to their enemies Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek?
    (2) Will they insist on making the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission unable to function, placing it under the control and domination of the United States?
    (3) Will they truly provide the necessary time, freedom, and convenience to explain to the prisoners of war that they have the right to be repatriated home to live peaceful lives?
    (4) Will they continue to indefinitely delay the signing of the armistice agreement and refuse to hand over the post-armistice issue of finally resolving the prisoners of war to a higher-level political conference?
    The answers to these questions will determine whether the Korean War will end soon and whether tens of thousands of prisoners of war on both sides will return home quickly. The answers to these questions will show whether Washington is truly willing to ease tensions in the East and around the world.

### 新华社特派记者报道  美方要不要停战已临决定性考验

    美方要不要停战已临决定性考验
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会原定于二十日在板门店复会，现在，应美方首席代表哈利逊的请求，继续休会五天，到五月二十五日再开。这个请求已经得到我方同意，但是我方指出：“我们认为谈判不应久拖”。
    在八天的休会以后，代表团大会将再一次提供考验的机会，来看华盛顿方面是否真正希望朝鲜停战。这个考验是简单的，但也是决定性的。这个考验可以看出：美方代表是否会真正接受南日大将的八点方案作为协议和立即停战的基础，放弃他们强迫扣留战俘的“反建议”以及为了达到这一目的而提出的无理限制。
    哈利逊在东京与华盛顿的训令下提出“反建议”之前，板门店从来没有这样接近停战过，但是哈利逊的“反建议”使谈判倒退，破坏了恢复谈判的基础。美方五月十三日的“反建议”提出了不可接受的要求和无理的限制，遭到全世界的谴责，再度表明美方拖延时日，要想避免原可立即实现的停战。
    这里的观察家指出，为了要使谈判有所进展，美方代表首先必须恢复停战谈判的基础。这次谈判是在双方同意的原则上恢复的，这个原则是把停战后未直接遣返的战俘交给中立国看管，以求公正解决他们的遣返问题。美方代表绝不能以不能接受的要求使谈判倒退，因为他们知道这些要求是永远不会被接受的。观察家进一步指出，华盛顿方面必须记住，它不能在双方以平等地位参加谈判的会议桌上擅自决定条件，除非它故意这样做，来防止缔结停战协定，“死赖”在朝鲜。
    二十三天以前恢复的停战谈判的纪录是明白无误的。迄今只有朝中方面代表以行动表示了他们真诚希望朝鲜迅速停战。他们为了解除美方接二连三提出的借口而作的明显的努力与让步，原已使谈判接近解决的边缘。他们的八点方案得到世界舆论的欢迎，被认为是在战俘问题和迅速停战上求得协议的稳固基础。根据这个建议，所有战俘都将能够迅速回家，朝鲜战争可以立即结束。由于停战后最后处理战俘问题提交了高一级的政治会议，这个停战后的问题便不会妨碍停战协定的签订。
    板门店美方代表的行动破坏了谈判的基础，使得谈判从解决的边缘倒退下来。他们的“反建议”充满了复杂的细节，为的是要阻碍尽可能多的战俘回家，避免迅速获得协议和停战。与美方推翻谈判基础同时，他们进行了严重的挑衅行为，轰炸了安东及我国其他城镇，轰炸鸭绿江上的水丰贮水池。
    华盛顿是否会继续漠视全世界对于根据朝中代表八点方案解决战俘问题的要求，尚有待分晓，这可以在全体会议恢复后对下列问题的答复中看出：
    （一）美方代表是否会坚持推翻谈判的基础，要求把朝中战俘在南朝鲜“释放为平民”，把他们交给他们的敌人李承晚和蒋介石？
    （二）他们是否会坚持使中立国遣返委员会不能发挥作用，把它置于美国的控制与支配之下？
    （三）他们是否会真正提供必要的时间、自由、便利以向战俘解释他们有权被遣返回家过和平生活？
    （四）他们是否会继续无限期地拖延停战协定的签订，拒绝把最后解决战俘的停战后的问题交给高一级的政治会议？
    对于这些问题的答复将决定朝鲜战争是否会早日结束，双方成千成万的战俘是否会迅速回家。这些问题的答复将说明华盛顿方面是否真正愿意缓和东方以及全世界的紧张局势。
