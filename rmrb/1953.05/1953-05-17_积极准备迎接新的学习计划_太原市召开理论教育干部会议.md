    Actively Prepare to Welcome the New Study Plan
    Taiyuan City Holds Cadre Meeting on Theoretical Education

    The CCP Central Committee's instructions on cadre theoretical education for 1953-1954 have received widespread attention from cadres in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province. The directly affiliated Party Committee of the CCP Taiyuan Municipal Committee immediately notified its subordinate Party Committees, General Branches, and Branches of various departments to study it, and convened a meeting of Party theoretical education cadres on April 28 to discuss how to conclude the current study of Party history by cadres in order to prepare for the new study plan in the second half of the year. The meeting also reviewed the leadership work of the previous stage of study and found that the common problems in each study area were weak ideological and organizational leadership. For example, only one-third of the more than 30 part-time theoretical teachers had taught classes, and most theoretical teachers were nominal. The tutoring work of the instructors was also perfunctory. In the grouping work, there were also erroneous ideas that emphasized the level of administrative positions and regarded grouping as a political privilege. Branches lacked specific and detailed leadership over the study. In response to the above-mentioned situation, the Propaganda Department of the directly affiliated Party Committee of the city instructed the Party Committee of the Municipal People's Government and the General Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to select a branch in mid-June and organize groups according to cultural level examinations based on the central instructions, in order to gain experience in grading and prepare for the study in the second half of the year. Branch committee members, group leaders, theoretical study group leaders, and instructors at all levels in party organizations must conscientiously study the central instructions and the People's Daily editorial of April 25: "Studying the theory and experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union is an important task for all party cadres." In order to strengthen the leadership of teaching and tutoring work, the directly affiliated Party Committee of the city decided to hold a symposium on the teaching experience of theoretical teachers to exchange experiences in tutoring work and the experience of senior groups leading the study of the middle and primary levels; and decided to launch a self-to-bottom and bottom-to-top campaign in the directly affiliated organs of the municipal party committee from June 11 to the end of the month to expose the bureaucracy, formalism, task-oriented views, and clericalism in the work of the propaganda departments in leading the theoretical education network and the propaganda network, seize good and bad typical examples for praise and criticism respectively, and deeply mobilize the masses to greet the new study plan in the second half of the year with practical actions.

    积极准备迎接新的学习计划
    太原市召开理论教育干部会议
    中共中央关于一九五三年——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示，已受到山西太原市干部的普遍重视。中共太原市委直属党委会当即通知所属各机关分党委会、总支、支部进行学习，并在四月二十八日召开党的理论教育干部会议，讨论如何结束目前干部的党史学习，以准备迎接下半年新的学习计划。在会议上并检查了上一阶段学习的领导工作，发现各学区普遍存在的问题是思想领导和组织领导都薄弱，如三十多个兼职理论教员只有三分之一上过课，大部分理论教员都是有名无实的，辅导员的辅导工作也流于形式。在编组工作中，还存在着强调行政职位高低，将编组当做政治待遇的错误思想。支部对学习缺乏具体的、细致的领导。针对上列情况，市直属党委会宣传部指示市人民政府分党委会，市公安局总支，要在六月中旬根据中央指示，选择一个支部按文化程度考试编组，以取得编级的经验，为下半年学习做好准备；各级党组织中的支部委员、小组长及理论学习小组长、辅导员都要认真研究学习中央指示及人民日报四月二十五日社论：“学习苏联社会主义建设的理论和经验是全党干部的重要任务”。为加强对教学、辅导工作的领导，市直属党委会决定召开一次理论教员教学经验座谈会，交流辅导工作经验及高级组带动中、初两级学习的经验；并决定从六月十一日至月底在市委直属机关开展一次自下而上又自上而下揭发宣教部门在领导理论教育网和宣传网工作中的官僚主义、公式主义、任务观点、事务主义等缺点，抓住好的、坏的典型分别进行表扬和批评，并深入发动群众，以实际行动来迎接下半年新的学习计划。（赵一萍）
