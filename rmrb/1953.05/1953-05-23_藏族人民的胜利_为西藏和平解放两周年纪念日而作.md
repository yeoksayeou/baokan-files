    The Victory of the Tibetan People
    —Written for the Second Anniversary of the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
    Li Youyi
    May 23rd of this year marks the second anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The peaceful liberation of Tibet is a shining victory of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies and the beginning of a new era in Tibetan history. From this point on, the Tibetan people have been forever freed from the enslavement and oppression of imperialism, and are united with other ethnic groups in the motherland to advance toward the road of freedom and happiness. Over the past two years, thanks to the correct implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies by the People's Liberation Army and government personnel stationed in Tibet, and their vigorous efforts to help the Tibetan people develop their economy, politics, and culture, overcoming numerous difficulties, they have achieved great success on all construction fronts. The Tibet region has undergone preliminary changes from its tragic and backward state before liberation.

    Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialists regarded the Tibetan people as objects of oppression and exploitation. They used bandits and secret agents to deceive and hoodwink, and to sow discord and division among ethnic groups, in order to achieve their goal of ruling the Tibetan people. After the Kuomintang gang was driven out of the mainland in 1949 and the great southwest was liberated, imperialists and reactionaries tried every possible means to obstruct and undermine the liberation of Tibet, attempting to seize Tibet as a base for invading the new China. However, all the conspiracies of the imperialists and reactionaries were smashed, and no force could stop the Chinese people's determination to liberate Tibet. The Tibetan people have victoriously returned to the warm family of the motherland.

    The Tibetan people have a long history. As stated in the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," the Tibetan people have made glorious contributions in the creation and development of the great motherland. As early as the beginning of the seventh century, the Tibetan people developed into a powerful nation. At this time, the Tibetan people produced their greatest national hero, Songtsen Gampo, who completed the great cause of unifying Tibet and created the Tubo Empire. During this period, various tribes absorbed each other's production technology and culture, which greatly developed the productive forces of the Tibetan people. Due to the unification of the tribes, the feudal system was also established at this time. At its peak, the Tubo territory extended beyond today's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and even Bengal, Assam, northern Burma, and Kashmir in India were once under Tubo rule. Even today, traces of ancient Tibetan culture can still be found in these areas.

    When Tubo was powerful, its strength was comparable to that of the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Taizong of Tang even married Princess Wencheng of the imperial clan to Songtsen Gampo. Princess Wencheng's entry into Tibet was very important in Tibetan history, because from this time on, the Han and Tibetan peoples developed a very close relationship.

    During this period, the Tibetan people absorbed a large amount of Han culture, and the Han people also absorbed Tibetan culture. The Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo sent a large number of young people to the interior to study, and also hired craftsmen from the interior to go to Tibet to teach skills, such as papermaking, pottery, milling, making agricultural tools, sericulture, weaving, architecture, and metallurgy. The introduction of these techniques developed the productive forces of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people also absorbed some of the Han people's lifestyles, such as clothing, supplies, and food. Today, the clothing and living supplies of the Tibetan aristocracy still retain a large part of the Tang Dynasty style. The close exchanges between the two ethnic groups promoted trade. Tea and silk from the interior were imported into Tibet in large quantities, and local specialties from Tibet flowed into the interior in a steady stream. From the Tang Dynasty onwards, the Han and Tibetan peoples had formed a close economic relationship.

    The Tibetan people established Lamaism at this time and created a writing system. At that time, in order to translate Buddhist scriptures, the Tibetan King sent a group of young people to India to study Buddhism. One of them, named Thonmi Sambhota, created the Tibetan script based on thirty letters in Sanskrit. Because the Tibetan script is phonetic and created grammar from the beginning, it was promoted quickly. Around the end of the seventh century, the entire Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was using Tibetan script.

    Tubo was strong for about two hundred years. By the end of the ninth century AD, due to the influence of religion, the royal military force declined, and many tribes split and became independent again. The power of temples and lamas grew day by day, and the people believed in lamas more than in the royal family. After the eleventh century, the ruling power of the Tibetan people was actually in the hands of the monasteries.

    In 1251 AD, Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty appointed Phagpa as the King of Tibet, which was the beginning of the theocratic regime in Tibet.

    The first sect in power was the Red Sect (Sakya School). This sect became corrupt over time as it had been in power for too long. Later, it was gradually rejected by the people. At the beginning of the fifteenth century AD, Tsongkhapa founded the Yellow Sect (Gelug School). The Yellow Sect did not gain political power at the beginning. It was not until the Third Dalai Lama Sonam Gyatso was invited by Altan Khan, the leader of the Qinghai Mongols, to preach in Qinghai that he was officially named the Dalai Lama (in 1575 AD). The Qing Dynasty's rule over Tibet was very cruel. On the one hand, it used military force to suppress it, and on the other hand, it created opposition between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. It tried its best to exploit it economically, such as controlling the tea trade and increasing taxes. Each Qing Dynasty resident minister in Tibet was rich when his term expired. The Qing government's political oppression and economic exploitation aroused widespread resistance from the Tibetan people. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, when the ruling power of the Qing Dynasty declined, the Tibetan people were no longer bound by the Qing Dynasty. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, imperialism invaded China step by step, and the rulers of the Qing Dynasty were unable to resist and did many things that humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty. Tibet naturally became a sacrifice. However, the Tibetan people resolutely resisted the imperialist aggression: they did not recognize the British imperialist occupation of Sikkim and Bhutan, refused to abide by any treaties signed by the Qing Dynasty government and imperialism that sold out the interests of the Tibetan people, and launched a vigorous anti-imperialist movement. In 1904, the British army invaded Tibet. Although the military strength was extremely disparate, the Tibetan people still made a heroic resistance. Although the result was a failure, they demonstrated the self-esteem of the Tibetan nation and wrote a glorious page in the history of resistance to imperialism.

    After imperialism invaded Tibet, it used economic aggression to suck the blood of the Tibetan people, nibble away at the land on the Tibetan border, provoke ethnic unity, provoke hatred and opposition between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, and train the local Tibetan army as their pawns to further invade China in the name of the Tibetan people. These deepened the suffering of the Tibetan people and made them recognize the true face of imperialism. The Tibetan people's resistance to imperialism has never stopped. They rose up to demonstrate to the imperialists, beat pro-British elements, opposed the establishment of police forces, and opposed the establishment of British schools. The Tibetan people's struggle against becoming slaves of imperialism became one of the important conditions for the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

    One of the achievements of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet was the elimination of the opposition between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama caused by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Tenth Panchen Lama gloriously returned to Tibet in April 1952 and was warmly welcomed by the Dalai Lama and all the Tibetan people. When the Panchen Lama and his entourage entered his throne-setting site, Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the Tibetan people there shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" to welcome him. They personally experienced the pain brought about by the ethnic division created by imperialism and reactionaries before liberation, and realized that as long as the ethnic groups united internally, good days would come.

    After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government carried out a series of economic construction projects in order to improve the economic life of the Tibetan people. First of all, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet announced the abolition of the "Ula" [Note] system. All People's Liberation Army and government personnel traveling to and from the Kang-Tibet roads did not use "Ula," and reasonable wages were given for hiring Tibetan horses or manual labor. Compensation was given at the original price for any deaths or losses. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet responded to Chairman Mao's call and launched a large-scale land reclamation and production movement. In the winter of 1951 alone, more than 4,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed on the Lhasa Plain, and a canal about 20 kilometers long was built. Based on the 3,000 mu of cultivated land sown in 1952, the first harvest was more than 400,000 catties of grain. Wheat, highland barley, and broad beans all grew particularly well. Each ear of wheat had an average of 80 grains, each ear of highland barley had 120 grains, and a large radish weighed 25 catties. This proves that the land in Tibet is fertile. In addition, land reclamation is also underway in areas such as Gyangze, Shigatse, Zêtang, Qamdo, Thirty-Nine Tribes, and Bomi. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. Although this number is extremely small compared to the arable wasteland on the Tibetan Plateau, it has played a great demonstration role for the Tibetan people. In the places where the People's Liberation Army reclaims land, Tibetan people often come to visit. The comrades working on the farms always seize the opportunity to teach farmers new agricultural production technologies and sometimes help them solve specific problems. The People's Liberation Army's enthusiasm for labor moved the Tibetan soldiers and civilians. The local Tibetan troops have now begun to work, and even the Tibetan nobles have changed their views on labor. Zhang Guohua, commander of the Tibet Military Region, once said: "Our land reclamation and production is not only to strive for self-sufficiency as soon as possible, but more importantly, to open up a road for building a prosperous and happy new Tibet."

    The biggest difficulty for Tibetan farmers is the lack of seeds during the spring sowing season, and some even have problems with food rations. Last May, the People's Liberation Army sent agricultural loan teams to the Zong (counties) and Xidui (manors) around Lhasa to issue interest-free loans, which solved the farmers' difficulties in lacking seeds and food rations, and greatly increased the farmers' production enthusiasm. More fertilizer was applied than in previous years, and some wheat fields were weeded once. They reaped a bumper harvest last year that they had not seen for many years. This year, the People's Liberation Army will continue to issue interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans. In addition to lending cash, it is also preparing to lend farmers necessities for life and production.

    Tibet's export trade is mainly wool, most of which was exported to India before liberation and then transshipped to various places. This trade has always been controlled by imperialism. Before and after liberation, imperialism wanted to use the blockade of Tibet's import and export trade to suffocate Tibet's economy. After 1950, wool exports from Tibetan areas dropped sharply, and large amounts of wool were stockpiled in Lhasa, Gyangze, Shigatse, and other places, seriously threatening the lives of herdsmen. In order to solve this difficulty, the state-owned Tibet Trading Corporation purchased all the stockpiled wool at fair and reasonable prices, worth hundreds of billions of RMB. This measure was welcomed by people from all walks of life in Tibet. This year, the state-owned Tibet Trading Corporation signed a contract with representatives of Tibetan wool merchants in April to purchase all the wool produced in Tibetan areas in 1952. The purchase of wool also has a more important significance, that is, it directly shattered the imperialist conspiracy to impose an economic blockade on Tibet. Their economic blockade not only cannot cause us any losses, but will only backfire on them. In India, there are many wool textile factories that rely on cheap wool from Tibet to maintain production, and many wool warehouses in Gangtok and Kalimpong have experienced business difficulties.

    Tibet had no industry at all before liberation. The only small handicrafts, such as textiles, were also ravaged by imperialist economic aggression. Tibet exports wool but imports woollen cloth. The native-made Pulu (Tibetan woollen fabric) has no way to compete with machine-woven woollen cloth. This year, in order to cooperate with the country's planned economic construction, the Tibet Military Region has begun small-scale industrial construction. At present, four model factories have been established for clothing, shoes and socks, wool textiles, leather, and iron and wood. The iron and wood factory is already rushing to make new-style plows, hoes, and other agricultural tools. Factories for electricity, borax, and wool washing are also being planned. The Lhasa State-owned Construction Company will also set up a timber factory and a brick, tile, and lime factory.

    Tibet has great potential for developing industry. It has countless rivers that can build hydropower stations. According to the estimate of the former Southwest Water Conservancy Department, 75% of the country's potential hydropower generation is in the southwest, and the Kang-Tibet Plateau accounts for two-thirds of this proportion. The source of power is endless. In addition, there are rich mineral deposits buried underground. According to the preliminary survey of the Geological Exploration Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Tibet, iron, coal, gypsum, graphite, salt, barite, Iceland spar, lead, milling, talc, and oil shale have been discovered in the Qamdo area, and iron, lead, tin, platinum, gypsum, graphite, and mica have been discovered in the Bomi area. Currently, this working team is shifting its work from northern Tibet to southern Tibet. We believe they will bring even more exciting news.

    The Tibetan people were very backward in culture before liberation because they had long suffered from the aggression and deception of imperialism and domestic reactionary rule. There was not a single school in Tibet. During the Qing Dynasty, there was a ban on allowing books to leave the customs, fearing that ethnic minorities would gain a little knowledge. Therefore, the Tibetan people were extremely lacking in scientific knowledge. All problems had to be solved by chanting scriptures, and even illnesses had to be treated by chanting scriptures. Natural disasters could only be attributed to fate and could not be prevented or controlled. After liberation, schools were established in several large areas to train cadres and instill urgently needed scientific knowledge to the Tibetan people. Over the past two years, seven primary schools have been established in Lhasa, Qamdo, Dingqing, Bomi, and other places. Lhasa Primary School has more than 800 Tibetan students. These schools all use Tibetan language for teaching. The religious beliefs and customs of Tibetan teachers and students are fully respected.

    Tibetan young men and women are beginning to develop a strong interest in scientific knowledge. The Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association has been established. The main task of this organization is to promote and carry forward the old scientific and cultural traditions and to learn new scientific and artistic knowledge. They love the People's Liberation Army's cultural troupe, and they love movies and pictorials about the great construction of the motherland and the Soviet Union. The Tibetan people, especially the younger generation, have seen that a good life in the future requires the construction of large-scale industries with scientific knowledge and technology. Now, the number of young people who want to come to the interior to study is increasing day by day. The culture of Tibet has begun to be injected with new scientific blood.

    In order to develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, agricultural experiment stations, animal husbandry experiment stations, agricultural implement factories, serum factories, and mobile veterinary work teams are being planned. The Tibetan Agricultural Technology Cadre Training Class attached to the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station has absorbed a group of cadres with a certain level of education and agricultural production experience to participate in learning, preparing to train a group of agricultural construction talents to go to various places to assist the local Tibetan government in agricultural, animal husbandry, forestry and other construction work. People's hospitals, clinics, and medical teams have been established in Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyangze, Dingqing, Heihe, Bomi, and other places, and more than 20,000 Tibetan people have been treated.

    On the day of commemorating the second anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, we pay the highest tribute and heartfelt gratitude to the People's Liberation Army who overcame numerous difficulties and were stationed in Tibet. The achievements of construction on the Tibetan Plateau over the past two years have been mainly created by them. If you ride in a car and climb over Erlang Mountain, Zheduo Mountain, and Que'er Mountain, going back and forth through the sea of clouds, you will realize how the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are building the border of the motherland with revolutionary heroism and tenacious labor spirit. They have built roads on the roof of the world, and turned wasteland into fertile land. They build wherever they go, and they guard the border of the motherland with high vigilance, so that imperialism dare not invade. With the development of the motherland's construction, Tibet will gradually contribute its strength. The Tibetan people have not only made glorious contributions in the creation and development of the motherland in the past, but also will shoulder glorious tasks in the great construction of the motherland in the future.

    [Note] "Ula" refers to corvée labor (a system during the Kuomintang period).

    藏族人民的胜利
    ——为西藏和平解放两周年纪念日而作
    李有义
    西藏和平解放，到今年五月二十三日已满两周年了。西藏的和平解放是毛主席的民族政策的光辉胜利，是西藏民族历史上一个新时代的开始。藏族人民从此永远摆脱了帝国主义的奴役与压迫，和祖国的其他各族人民团结在一起向着自由幸福的道路前进。两年来，由于进藏的人民解放军和政府的工作人员正确地执行了毛主席的民族政策，大力帮助藏族人民发展经济、政治和文化，克服了重重困难，在各个建设战线上都获得了巨大的成就，西藏地方已经初步改变了解放前悲惨落后的面貌。
    解放前，国民党反动派和帝国主义把藏族人民当作压迫剥削的对象。他们利用土匪特务进行欺骗蒙蔽，挑拨离间，使民族内部分裂对立，借以达到统治藏族人民的目的。一九四九年国民党匪帮被逐出大陆，大西南获得解放以后，帝国主义和反动派曾千方百计地阻挠和破坏西藏的解放，企图攫取西藏作为侵犯新中国的一个据点。但是帝国主义和反动派的一切阴谋都被粉碎了，没有任何力量阻止得了中国人民解放西藏的决心。藏族人民胜利地回到了祖国温暖的大家庭里来。
    藏族人民具有悠久的历史。正如“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”中所说的，藏族在伟大祖国的创造与发展过程中尽了光荣的责任。远在第七世纪初，藏族就发展成为一个强大的民族，这时藏族产生了自己最伟大的民族英雄松赞干布，他完成了统一西藏的大业，创造了吐番帝国。在这一时期中，各部落之间互相吸取生产技术和文化，使藏族的生产力得到很大的发展。由于部落的统一，封建制度也在这时建立起来。吐番最盛时，领土越出了今天的康藏高原，连印度的孟加拉、阿萨密、北部缅甸、喀什米尔都一度置于吐番统治之下。直到今日，在这些地区仍然可以找到古代藏族文化的遗迹。
    吐番强大时，它的力量可和唐朝相敌。唐太宗曾把宗室女文成公主嫁给松赞干布。文成公主的入藏在藏族历史上是很重要的，因为从这时开始，藏汉两族人民发生了极密切的关系。
    在这个时期中，藏族大量吸收汉族的文化，汉族也吸收藏族的文化。藏王松赞干布曾派了大批青年到内地来学习，也聘请了内地的工匠到西藏去传授技艺，如造纸、制陶、碾磨、制造农具、养蚕、纺织、建筑、冶金等。这些技艺的输入，发展了藏族的生产力。藏族人民也吸取了一部分汉族的生活方式，如衣饰、用品、饮食之类。今日西藏贵族的服饰和生活起居用品，还有一大部分保存了唐代的式样。两个民族间的密切来往促进了贸易，内地的茶叶、绸缎大量输入藏区，藏区的土特产也源源流入内地。从唐代起，藏汉两族人民在经济上就结成了密切的关系。
    藏族这时建立了喇嘛教，创造了文字。当时为了翻译佛经，藏王曾派一批青年到印度去学经，其中有一个名叫吞弥桑保扎的，根据梵文创造了以三十个字母为基础的藏文。由于藏文是拼音字，而且一开始就创造了文法，所以推行起来很快，大约在第七世纪末整个康藏高原上就都通用藏文了。
    吐番强大了约有二百多年，到公元第九世纪末由于宗教的影响，王室的武力衰微了，许多部落又分裂独立起来，寺院和喇嘛的势力却日渐增长，人民信仰喇嘛比信仰王室还深。到十一世纪以后，藏族的统治权实际已操在寺院手中了。
    公元一二五一年，元世祖忽必烈封八思巴为西藏王，是西藏政教合一政权的开端。
    最初执政的教派是红教（萨迦派）。这一教派因掌权日久，慢慢腐化起来。后来逐渐受到人民的厌弃。公元十五世纪初，宗喀巴创立了黄教（格鲁派）。黄教在初创时并没有获得政权，直到第三世达赖琐南嘉错应青海蒙古部长俺答汗的邀请到青海传法后，才正式被封为达赖喇嘛（公元一五七五年）。清朝对西藏的统治是很惨酷的，一面用武力镇压，一面制造达赖与班禅间的对立，在经济上尽量地剥削，如控制茶叶贸易，加重税捐。清廷的每个驻藏大臣任满后，都是腰缠累累。清政府在政治上的压迫和经济上的剥削，引起了藏族人民普遍的反抗。到清末清廷统治力量衰微时，藏族人民就已不受清廷的约束。清末帝国主义步步侵入中国，清朝的统治者无法抵御，作了不少的丧权辱国勾当，西藏自然也成了牺牲品。但是藏族人民对帝国主义的侵略是坚决反抗的：他们不承认英帝国主义强占锡金和不丹，拒绝遵守清朝政府与帝国主义所订的任何出卖西藏人民利益的条约，掀起了如火如荼的反帝运动。一九○四年英军侵入西藏，虽然在兵力极端悬殊的情况下，西藏人民仍作了英勇的抵抗。结果虽然是失败了，但他们表现了西藏民族的自尊心，写下了反抗帝国主义的一页辉煌历史。
    帝国主义侵入西藏后，利用经济侵略吮吸藏族人民的血液，蚕食藏边土地，挑拨民族团结，挑拨达赖和班禅互相仇视和对立，训练西藏地方军队，作为他们借藏族名义进一步侵略中国的爪牙。这些都加深了藏族人民的灾难，使藏族人民认识了帝国主义的真面目。藏族人民对帝国主义的反抗一天都没有停止过。他们曾起来向帝国主义示威，殴打亲英分子，反对办警察，反对办英国学校。藏族人民不甘心做帝国主义奴隶的斗争，成为实现西藏和平解放的重要条件之一。
    和平解放西藏办法协议的成就之一，就是将帝国主义和国民党反动派造成的达赖和班禅的对立消除了。第十世班禅已于一九五二年四月光荣地回到西藏，受到达赖喇嘛和全体藏族人民热烈的欢迎。当班禅喇嘛一行进入自己的坐床地扎什伦布寺时，那里的藏族人民高呼着毛主席万岁来欢迎他。他们亲身体验了解放前帝国主义和反动派制造出来的民族分裂所带来的痛苦，认识了只要民族内部团结起来，好日子就要来到了。
    西藏和平解放后，中央人民政府为了改善藏族人民的经济生活，进行了一系列的经济建设工作。首先是进藏的人民解放军宣布废除了“乌拉”〔注〕制，所有在康藏道路上来往的解放军和政府工作人员一律不使用“乌拉”，雇用藏族的马匹或人工，都给予合理的工资，死亡或损失了的，都照价赔偿。进藏的人民解放军响应毛主席的号召，展开了大规模的开荒生产运动。一九五一年冬仅在拉萨平原上就开出了四千多亩荒地，并修了长约二十多公里的水渠。以一九五二年下种的三千亩耕地计算，第一次就收获了四十多万斤粮食。小麦、青稞、蚕豆都长得特别壮，小麦每穗平均有八十粒，青稞每穗有一百二十粒，一个大萝卜重二十五斤。这都证明西藏的土地是肥沃的。此外，在江孜、日喀则、孜塘、昌都、三十九族、波密等地区都在进行开荒，据不完全的统计，开出的荒地已有一万多亩。这个数目和西藏高原上可耕的荒地比较虽极微小，但对藏族人民起了很大的示范作用。在解放军开荒的地方，都经常有藏族人民来参观。农场工作的同志们随时抓住机会，把新的农业生产技术教给农民，有时并帮助他们解决具体问题。解放军的劳动热情感动了藏族军民，西藏地方部队现在也开始劳动了，连西藏的贵族对劳动的看法也改变了。西藏军区张国华司令员曾说：“我们开荒生产不仅是为了争取尽早自给，更重要的是为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏开辟一条道路。”
    西藏农民最大的困难是在春季播种时缺乏种籽，有的连口粮都成问题。去年五月人民解放军派出了农贷小组到拉萨周围的宗（县）和锡堆（庄园）发放无利贷款，解决了农民缺乏种籽和口粮的困难，农民的生产情绪大为提高。肥料比往年上的多了，有的麦田还拔了一次草。他们在去年得到了多年没有的丰收。今年解放军仍发放无利农牧贷款，除了贷现款外，还准备贷给农民生活和生产的必需品。
    西藏的出口贸易主要是羊毛，解放前大部都向印度出口，再转输各地。这宗贸易一向是由帝国主义控制把持的。解放前后，帝国主义即想利用封锁西藏的进出口贸易来窒息西藏的经济。一九五○年以后，藏族地区羊毛出口锐减，在拉萨、江孜、日喀则等地都积存有大量的羊毛，严重地威胁着牧民的生活。为了解决这个困难，国营西藏贸易总公司就以公平合理的价格收购了价值数百亿人民币的全部存毛。这一措施受到了藏族各阶层人民的欢迎。今年国营西藏贸易总公司又于四月份和西藏毛商的代表签订合同，收购一九五二年度藏区所产的全部羊毛。收购羊毛还有一个更重大的意义，即直接粉碎了帝国主义对西藏经济封锁的阴谋。他们的经济封锁不仅不能给我们以任何损失，反而自食其果。在印度有好些依靠西藏的廉价羊毛维持生产的毛纺织厂，在岗拖、噶林堡有好多家毛栈，都已发生经营上的困难。
    西藏在解放前是完全没有工业的，仅有的一点小手工业如纺织之类，也被帝国主义的经济侵略摧残得气息奄奄。西藏出口羊毛却进口毛呢，土法织的氆氇没有法子和机织的毛呢竞争。今年为了配合祖国有计划的经济建设，西藏军区已开始进行小型的工业建设。目前已成立了被服鞋袜、毛纺织、皮革和铁木四个示范性的工厂，铁木工厂已经在赶制新式犁、锄头等农具。正在筹备中的还有电力、硼砂、洗毛等工厂。拉萨国营建筑公司也将附设木料厂和砖瓦石灰厂。
    西藏发展工业是有极大的潜在力的，它有无数可以建立水电站的河流。据前西南水利部的估计，全国水力发电的潜在量的百分之七十五在西南，康藏高原又占了这个比例的三分之二，动力的来源是无穷无尽的。另外地下埋藏着丰富的矿藏。据中国科学院西藏工作队地质勘察组的初步勘察，在昌都地区发现了铁、煤、石膏、石墨、盐、重晶石、冰岛石、铅、铣、滑石、油母页岩等矿产，在波密地区发现了铁、铅、锡、铂、石膏、石墨、云母等矿。目前这个工作队正由藏北转向藏南工作。我们相信他们将带来更令人兴奋的消息。
    西藏人民在解放前因为长期遭受帝国主义和国内反动统治的侵略和欺骗，文化非常落后，全西藏没有一所学校。清朝时代曾有诗书不准出关的禁令，深怕少数民族获得一点知识。因此西藏人民极度缺乏科学知识，一切问题都要靠念经来解决，有病也要念经。对天然灾害只能委诸天命，无法防治。解放后若干大地区成立了学校，训练干部，把急需的科学知识灌输给藏族人民。两年来在拉萨、昌都、丁青、波密等地成立起七所小学。拉萨小学有藏族学生八百多人。这些学校都用藏文藏语教学。藏族教师和学生的宗教信仰和风俗习惯完全受到尊重。
    藏族的青年男女们开始对科学知识发生浓厚的兴趣。拉萨成立了爱国青年文化联谊会。这个组织的主要任务是提倡发扬旧有的科学和文化传统，学习新的科学和艺术的知识。他们喜爱解放军的文工队，喜爱关于祖国和苏联伟大建设的电影、画刊，藏族人民特别是青年一代已经看到了未来美好的生活是要用科学的知识和技术建设起大工业来。现在要求到内地来学习的青年一天天的多起来。西藏的文化开始注入了科学的新血液。
    为了发展农牧业生产，现正筹设农业试验场、畜牧试验场、农具厂、血清厂，和成立兽医巡回工作队。附设在拉萨农业试验场内的西藏农业技术干部训练班，吸收了一批具有一定文化水平和农业生产经验的干部参加学习，准备培养出一批农业建设人才，分赴各地协助西藏地方政府从事农、牧、林业等建设工作。现在拉萨、日喀则、江孜、丁青、黑河、波密等地都已建立了人民医院、门诊所和医疗队，有两万多藏族人民已受到治疗。
    在纪念西藏和平解放二周年的今日，我们对克服重重困难进驻西藏的人民解放军致以最崇高的敬礼和衷心的感激。两年来西藏高原上建设的成绩，主要是他们创造出来的。假如你坐着汽车在云海中穿来穿去地爬过二郎山、折多山、雀儿山，你就会体会到解放军的战士是如何在以革命的英雄主义和顽强的劳动精神建设着祖国的边疆。他们把公路修上了世界屋脊，把荒野变成了良田，他们走到那里就建设到那里，并以高度的警惕保卫着祖国边疆，使帝国主义不敢侵犯。随着祖国建设的发展，西藏地方也将逐渐贡献出它的力量。藏族人民不仅过去在祖国的创造与发展中尽了光荣的责任，在未来祖国的大建设中他们也将负担起光荣的任务。
