Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China, first explained in his speech that the people's education cause in China has achieved great development and accomplishments in the past three and a half years. The broad masses of educational workers have become more firmly united in the ranks of the working class. Through continuous learning from the Soviet Union and improving their political, cultural, and professional levels, 4,152 model teachers have emerged among the national educational workers.

Wu Yuzhang said that now that the new period of planned construction of the country has arrived, it has put forward major tasks for educational workers across the country: we must continue to improve the cultural level and political consciousness of the people, train a large number of construction talents in various fields, and focus on training qualified senior and middle-level production construction talents. Special attention must be paid to training our own new-style talents from the working class and the laboring people, so that they can become the strong backbone of building society and managing the country.

Zhang Weizhen, head of the delegation of the Trade Union of Northeast China and Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, spoke. He said that modern, state-of-the-art, automated large-scale blast furnaces, rolling mills, seamless steel pipe plants, heavy machinery plants, extremely precise measuring tool and cutting tool factories, electrical appliance factories, power plants, mines, etc., that China has never had before are being built in Northeast China, and some have been completed and put into production.

After explaining the series of new problems and tasks put forward to us in the period of economic construction, and the most fundamental and effective methods to ensure the completion of these tasks, Zhang Weizhen emphasized the importance of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union based on the experience of the Northeast. He said that Chairman Mao called on us to learn from the Soviet Union, and our task is to fully realize this great call from Chairman Mao.

Fang Taiyu, head of the Korean Trade Union Delegation and Chairman of the Mining Workers' Union of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, extended warm brotherly congratulations to the congress and the Chinese working class on behalf of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions and the Korean working class, and paid heartfelt respect to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China. He said that the victory of the Chinese people is a historically significant victory for the world democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and a brilliant example of the national struggle of the oppressed nations of the East. The convening of this congress is of great significance to the construction of China; it is also of great significance to the Korean people, especially the Korean working class; because the further prosperity and development of China will strengthen the strength of the Chinese people in resisting America and aiding Korea. With the support of the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side will surely win the final victory.

All the successes of China are a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people and other nations who are struggling for national independence and world peace. The Vietnamese people have learned from the struggle experience of the Chinese people and achieved a lot of success in the process of resisting imperialism and building a people's democratic system. Now the Vietnamese people are fighting side by side with the Khmer and Lao people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party. They are determined to defeat the French imperialist aggressors and American imperialist interventionists in order to win independence and freedom for their motherland and contribute their strength to defending world peace.

Pa.

The Polish people resolutely support the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the cessation of the Korean War. Pa. Wojas emphasized the importance of economic and cultural cooperation between countries with different social systems and called on the working people of the world to seek international solidarity in the struggle to defend their vital interests, trade union rights, national independence, democracy, and peace, and to fight for this purpose. Pa. Wojas finally congratulated the congress on its success. He said that the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has its important significance for the workers' movement, especially for the workers' movement in the Far East.

Yusuf, Vice President of the All-India Trade Union Congress, extended sincere and warm brotherly respect to the delegates on behalf of the Indian working class. He said that the birth of the People's Republic of China has strengthened the camp of world peace, democracy, and socialism; the experience of the Chinese people's liberation struggle has pointed out the road for the people of colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries. The Indian working class will always be a member of this broad camp and will resolutely fight against the forces of war. He said that the Indian people fully agree with the Chinese government's proposal on the Korean armistice. When talking about the struggle of the Indian working class, Yusuf emphasized that the most pressing issue in the Indian trade union ranks at present is the issue of unity.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions continued to hold a plenary session at 2:30 pm on the 5th. The executive chairpersons were Liu Changsheng, Zhang Weizhen, Wang Weigang, Du Yanqing, and Li Zhaozhen.

In the afternoon, the congress continued to hold speeches, and everyone unanimously agreed with the reports of Lai Ruoyu, Xu Zhizhen, and Li Zaiwen in their speeches, and expressed their determination to work hard to implement the policies and tasks formulated by the congress.

Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, gave a brief overview of the major achievements of the Textile Workers' Union of China in improving production and labor protection, and introduced the main experiences of the Textile Workers' Union in facing production. Chen Shaomin said that in 1950, the Textile Workers' Union organized textile workers across the country to increase production in a blitz, solving the difficulty of insufficient supply of yarn and cloth at that time, and therefore received bonuses from the government. However, the labor competition at that time mainly relied on increasing labor intensity. It was not until the Hao Jianxiu work method was summarized that trade union cadres found the way for trade unions to face production, and the competition changed from simply increasing labor intensity to improving technology and proficiency, and from a blitz to a regular practice. After the Hao Jianxiu work method was summarized, the Soviet Kovalev work method was used, and the "1951 Weaving Work Method" and the "1953 Textile Machine Maintenance Work Method" were also summarized one after another. The promotion of advanced experience broke the old production standards, and a series of problems in production were bound to be exposed. Therefore, a wage reform, working hours reform, and improvement of labor organization were carried out in state-owned textile factories across the country, so that the production level was continuously improved. On this basis, the working conditions and material and cultural life of textile workers have also been greatly improved.

Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China, used concrete facts to illustrate that the restoration and reform of coal mine production in China has been basically completed, and the living conditions of coal miners have undergone major changes. He especially pointed out that, with the large amount of investment by the people's government, the degree of mechanization of the coal mining industry has been greatly improved. At present, the mechanization of mining faces has reached 78%, and the mechanization of transportation systems has reached 70%. Jin Zhifu said that the reform of coal mine production was carried out under the assistance of Soviet experts and by learning from the Soviet Union and promoting advanced Soviet experience. The great achievements of coal mine production reform fully prove that the Soviet assistance is technically sophisticated and first-rate.

Fan Yong, a representative of Chinese railway employees participating in the anti-US and aid-Korea war who won the Second-Class Warrior Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, expressed the heroic spirit of Chinese railway employees participating in the anti-US and aid-Korea war.

Zhou Chuandian, Deputy Director of the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and a labor model, reported to the congress on the construction of No. 8 blast furnace, one of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's capital construction in 1952, and the various aspects of assistance given by Soviet experts in this project.

Walisi, Deputy Manager of the Oil Extraction Department of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company and a labor model, spoke at the congress on behalf of workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. He said that the workers of all ethnic groups in our Xinjiang Province must strengthen unity, work hard in production, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national economic construction plan.

Jiang Tao, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Chemical Workers' Union, congratulated the convening of the congress on behalf of the chemical workers. He said that the chemical workers across the country will unite closely around Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive with hundredfold efforts to complete the national economic construction plan and accelerate the industrialization of the country.

Tong Jichun, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, was a silk weaver who had worked for more than ten years before liberation. He said that in order to create a better life, they are determined to strive to complete and overfulfill the country's production plan with selfless labor.

In the afternoon of the 5th, Kojima Hiroki, a member of the Japanese Trade Union Delegation and a central committee member of the National Procurement Agency Workers' Union of the Japanese Government Officials' Union Council, Maria Trojanova, head of the Czechoslovak Trade Union Delegation and Secretary of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions, Sudin Kumar Pramanik, a member of the Presidium of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Norovsambuu, head of the Mongolian People's Republic Trade Union Delegation and Chairman of the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions, and Guruswami, General Secretary of the All-India Railway Employees' Federation, successively addressed the congress.

Kojima Hiroki, a member of the Japanese Trade Union Delegation and a central committee member of the National Procurement Agency Workers' Union of the Japanese Government Officials' Union Council, congratulated the congress on behalf of Japanese workers, and he sincerely thanked Chinese workers for the encouragement and assistance given to Japanese workers, farmers, and all Japanese people. Kojima Hiroki said that the victory of the great Chinese people's revolution, as well as the subsequent peaceful construction of China, the leap forward in production, and the continuous improvement of people's lives, have given great hope, courage, and confidence to the Japanese working class who are struggling for national independence, freedom, and peace. Japanese workers are determined not to let the Japanese territory be reduced to an American base of aggression. Japanese workers are uniting and unifying, and at the same time, they are closely uniting farmers to carry out the struggle. Kojima Hiroki then described the great development of the Japanese workers' movement and emphasized the firm determination of Japanese workers not to be enemies with the Asian brother peoples. Kojima Hiroki said that the interests of Chinese and Japanese workers are completely consistent. For this common purpose, Japanese workers will learn from the victorious experience of Chinese workers, and Japanese workers vow to stand with Chinese workers and further launch a powerful struggle.

Maria Trojanova, head of the Czechoslovak Trade Union Delegation and Secretary of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions, extended cordial and friendly fighting salutes to the delegates on behalf of 3.5 million organized workers and all the working people of Czechoslovakia.

Czechoslovak workers carefully produce various orders from China with enthusiasm, and they are very happy that they can help the Chinese people quickly realize China's industrialization. Trojanova said that since taking power, the Czechoslovak people have firmly believed that the strength of the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union is invincible. Under the leadership of Sopototski, President Gottwald's best comrade-in-arms, the Czechoslovak people will surely fulfill Gottwald's legacy.

Sudin Kumar Pramanik, a member of the Presidium of the All-India Trade Union Congress, extended warm brotherly congratulations to all the delegates on behalf of the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indian working class, and the Indian people. He said that the two great nations of China and India have had friendly brotherly relations since ancient times. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people over the years must be further developed to build an invincible force for peace and freedom. He expressed his hope to unite with the Soviet people and to unite with all exploited and oppressed nations. He praised the achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects. When talking about the situation in India, he emphasized that the Indian working class must earnestly do everything possible to unite the trade unions and establish a united front of all progressive and revolutionary forces so that the Indian working class can better fulfill its historical mission.

Norovsambuu, head of the Mongolian Trade Union Delegation and Chairman of the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions, extended warm brotherly greetings to the congress on behalf of the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions of the Mongolian People's Republic.

    中国纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏在发言中，概括地说明了中国纺织工会在改进生产和劳动保护工作方面的重大成就，并介绍了纺织工会面向生产的主要经验。陈少敏说，一九五○年，纺织工会组织全国纺织工人突击增产，解决了当时纱布供应不足的困难，因而得到了政府的奖金。但是当时的劳动竞赛，主要还是靠提高劳动强度。直到郝建秀工作法总结出来以后，工会干部才算摸到工会面向生产的门径，竞赛才由单纯的提高劳动强度进入提高技术和熟练程度，由突击进入经常。在郝建秀工作法总结出来以后，运用了苏联郭瓦廖夫工作方法，“一九五一织布工作法”和“一九五三纺织机器保全工作法”也被先后总结出来了。先进经验的推广，打破了旧的生产标准，必然暴露出生产中一系列的问题，因此，全国各国营纺织厂随着又进行了工资改革、工时改革和改善劳动组织的工作，使生产水平不断提高。在这个基础上，纺织工人的劳动条件和物质文化生活也得到了很大的改善。
    中国煤矿工会全国委员会主席金直夫的发言，用具体事实说明了中国煤矿生产的恢复和改革工作已基本上完成，煤矿工人的生活状况已起了重大的变化。他特别指出，煤矿工业在人民政府的大量投资下，机械化程度已大大提高了，目前采掘掌子的机械化已达到百分之七十八，运输系统的机械化已达到百分之七十。金直夫说，煤矿的生产改革是在苏联专家帮助下，以学习苏联、推广苏联先进经验来进行的。煤矿生产改革的巨大成绩，充分证明了苏联的帮助在技术上是精湛的，头等的。
    荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国二级战士荣誉勋章的中国志愿抗美援朝铁路员工代表范永的发言，表现了中国铁路员工参加抗美援朝斗争的英雄气概。
