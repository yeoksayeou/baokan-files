    Provocateurs Are Doomed to Fail

    Just as people all over the world were eager for the Korean armistice, and the Korean-Chinese armistice negotiation delegation was putting forward constructive proposals one after another to resolve the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war, striving to achieve the Korean armistice, the US invading air force in Korea outrageously invaded the airspace of the Lagu Shao and Andong areas of Northeast China on May 10th and 11th for the third time, dropping more than 50 bombs and killing and wounding more than 260 of our peaceful residents. This is another manifestation of the US government's arrogant and provocative attitude, and another instance of the US government's aggressive crimes against our country. The Chinese people are extremely angry at this new crime committed by the US government. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai was authorized to issue a statement on this, lodging a serious protest with the US government.
    The new crimes committed by the US invading air force in Korea by violating our country's airspace and killing and wounding our peaceful residents are clearly not an isolated incident. It is an integral part of the US government's provocative actions to influence the Korean armistice negotiations. This incident created by the United States is by no means just a provocation against the Chinese people, nor is it just a provocation against the Chinese and Korean peoples, but a provocation against all the people in the world who desire the Korean armistice. As our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in his protest statement: "Now, just as the Korean armistice negotiations are underway, the US government has dispatched its invading air force in Korea to violate Chinese airspace and kill and wound Chinese people. Obviously, the US government's provocative action is an attempt to influence the Korean armistice negotiations and to challenge the desire of people all over the world for the Korean armistice." This is the only possible correct judgment of the US aircraft provocation incident.
    No forgetful person would forget US President Eisenhower's foreign policy speech on April 16. That speech clearly had the following words: "We seek a true and comprehensive peace throughout Asia, as throughout the world." However, it is now difficult to determine how much weight these words and other similar words actually carry on the scales of American merchants. Due to the US government's provocative attitude, the people of our country and the people of the world cannot but have great doubts about whether the US government has any sincerity for peace. Moreover, more and more facts give people reason to suspect whether the "peace" that the US government has expressed has any serious rational component, or whether it is entirely the glib talk of Wall Street merchants in the stock exchange.
    The negotiations in Panmunjom are now underway. People remember that this negotiation was resumed based on the fair and reasonable proposals put forward in the statement of Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Kim Il-sung. After the resumption of this long-interrupted Korean armistice negotiation, the Korean-Chinese side successively put forward two constructive proposals to solve the problem of the repatriation of all prisoners of war, and repeatedly made obvious concessions in the steps and methods of repatriation. As long as the US side has the genuine sincerity to achieve the armistice, an agreement can now be reached immediately. However, the US representatives continued to raise a lot of irrelevant administrative details to delay the progress of the negotiations. Moreover, at this time, the US invading air force in Korea committed the crime of violating our country's airspace and killing and wounding our peaceful residents, attempting to influence the Korean armistice negotiations with this provocative action. This is clearly completely contrary to US President Eisenhower's call for "peace." Even the British bourgeois newspaper "Manchester Guardian" rebuked the US side's performance in the Korean armistice negotiations as "seeming too arrogant," a kind of "rude tone," and "risking the breakdown of negotiations."
    We want to solemnly warn the US government: it is not acceptable for you to be saying "seeking true and comprehensive peace" on the one hand, and unreasonably provoking on the other. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has pointed out unequivocally in the protest statement: "It can be asserted that the US government's attempt is bound to fail. The firm will of the Chinese and Korean peoples to fight for peace is absolutely unshakable." Our peace policy is in line with the wishes of people all over the world, and it is as unshakable as a rock. In the face of the great strength of the peace-loving people, the provocateurs are bound to fail, this can be completely asserted.

### 挑衅者必败

    挑衅者必败
    正当全世界人民渴望朝鲜停战，朝中停战谈判代表团为解决全部战俘遣返问题，接连提出建设性的方案，力谋实现朝鲜停战的时候，美国侵朝空军于五月十日和十一日竟又三次侵袭我国东北拉古哨和安东地区领空，投弹五十余枚，炸死炸伤我国和平居民二百六十余人。这又一次表现了美国政府蛮横挑衅的态度，又一次造成了美国政府对我国的侵略罪行。我国人民对于美国政府的这个新的罪行，极为愤怒，我国周恩来外长受权对此发表声明，向美国政府提出了严重的抗议。
    美国侵朝空军侵犯我国领空并杀伤我国和平居民的新的罪行，显然不是一个孤立的事件。它是美国政府企图影响朝鲜停战谈判的挑衅行动的一个组成部分。美国所制造的这个事件绝不只是对我国人民的挑衅，也不只是对中朝两国人民的挑衅，而是对全世界一切渴望朝鲜停战的人民的挑衅。正如我国周恩来外长在抗议的声明中所说的：“现在，正当朝鲜停战谈判进行之际，美国政府竟出动其侵朝空军，侵犯中国领空，杀伤中国人民。显然，美国政府这一挑衅行动是在企图影响朝鲜停战谈判，并对全世界人民要求朝鲜停战的渴望，进行挑战。”这是对于美机挑衅事件的唯一可能做出的正确判断。
    任何健忘的人也不会就忘记美国总统艾森豪威尔在四月十六日发表的外交政策演说。那个演说分明有如下的字句：“我们在整个亚洲正如在整个世界一样，寻求一个真正的全面的和平”。但是，这些字句以及其他类似的字句在美国商行的秤盘上究竟占多少重量，现在就很难使人断定了。由于美国政府的这种挑衅的态度，就使我国人民和全世界人民，对于美国政府究竟有无和平的诚意，不能不发生极大的怀疑。而且事实越来越多地使人有理由怀疑，美国政府所曾经表示的“和平”到底有百分之几的严肃的理智成分，或者完全是华尔街商人在交易所里信口开河的油腔滑调。
    现在板门店的谈判正在进行。人们都记得，这个谈判是根据周恩来总理和金日成元帅的声明中所提出的公平合理的建议而恢复的。在这个长期中断的朝鲜停战谈判恢复之后，朝中方面又先后提出了解决全部战俘遣返问题的两个建设性的方案，在遣俘的步骤和方法上一再做了明显的让步，只要美方有真正实现停战的诚意，现在已经可以立即达成协议了。但是，美方代表却继续提出一大堆无关紧要的行政细节问题，来拖延谈判的进展。而且，就在这个时候，美国侵朝空军又做出了侵犯我国领空并杀伤我国和平居民的罪行，企图以这种挑衅的行动，来影响朝鲜停战谈判。这和美国总统艾森豪威尔的“和平”呼吁显然是完全背道而驰的。就是英国的资产阶级报纸
    “曼彻斯特卫报”也斥责美方在朝鲜停战谈判中的表现是“显得太蛮横了”，是一种“粗暴腔调”，是“在冒使谈判破裂的危险”。
    我们要正告美国政府：你们一方面口口声声说要“寻求真正的全面的和平”，一方面又无理地进行挑衅，这是不行的。我国周恩来外长在抗议的声明中已经斩钉截铁地指出：“可以断言，美国政府这一企图是一定要失败的。中朝两国人民为和平而奋斗的坚强意志是绝对不可动摇的。”我们的和平政策是符合于全世界人民的愿望的，它和磐石一般不可摇撼。在和平人民的伟大力量面前，挑衅者必败，这是完全可以断定的。
