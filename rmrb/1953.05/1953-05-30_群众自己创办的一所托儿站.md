The Sixth Latitude Road Nursery Station in the Fourth District of Tianjin was founded by local residents themselves. Since its establishment, the working women in the nearby dozen streets have been able to participate in production and work happily and actively because they are no longer burdened by their children; and the babbling toddlers no longer cry and fuss because their mothers have gone to work.

The Sixth Latitude Road area is a place where working people live. At present, many private factories or small schools do not have nursery facilities, and when mothers go to work, no one takes care of the children at home. Cui Mali, a female teacher living on Eleventh Jing Road, often locked her three-year-old daughter in the house. By the time she got off work, the child was hoarse from crying. Some female workers in factories asked their daughters to drop out of school to take care of the young children. But facts have proved that using older children to take care of young children is not a proper solution. Therefore, establishing a nursery has become an urgent requirement of working women in the Sixth Latitude Road area.

In June of last year, Fu Chonghua, a representative of the district people's congress living on this street, proposed to set up a street nursery. His proposal was warmly supported by local residents, and subsequently, a preparatory committee for the nursery station was formed by 63 people, including resident representatives, women representatives, and enthusiastic people. Yu Xiuhua, a women's representative, was the first to sign up to be a volunteer childcare worker at the nursery. Zang Keming, a young woman who had received childcare training, and Liu Yangming, a housewife, also signed up to participate. Xu Wende, a resident, volunteered to lend three empty rooms, and other committee members sent beds, tables, chairs, pots, bowls, spoons, thermos flasks, clocks, and all other utensils. Doctor Xu Jindong also sent a bolt of white cloth and fifteen pounds of cotton to sew new bedding for the children.

The nursery station was officially established, stipulating that it would accommodate children aged one and a half to four years old. The monthly fee was 65,000 yuan. In the first month of operation, there were very few children admitted, only Cui Mali's daughter and another boy named Bai Juqiang. Other mothers were afraid that the nursery station would not be run well, and that the childcare workers would not be able to take care of the children. They took a wait-and-see attitude. A month passed, Cui Mali's daughter gained two and a half kilograms, and Bai Juqiang also gained two kilograms, his thin, pointed mouth turned round. The nursery station held a mothers' meeting, and the mothers of these two children reported to the other mothers. From then on, more and more mothers asked to send their children to the station, and two months later the number of children increased to twenty.

The childcare workers at the nursery station carefully took care of the children, preparing their food very well every day, including eggs, beef, vegetables, and sparerib soup; they also drank soy milk in the morning. The childcare workers carried out various educations according to the children's age, telling stories to the children, teaching them to sing, and doing gymnastics. Local residents also often cared about the nursery station: doctors Xu Jindong and Xu Jinqin, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Fan Binglin, etc., performed a free physical examination for all the children in the station once a month, and were also responsible for the daily free medical treatment of the children in the station. Nearby women helped the nursery station's children wash their bedsheets every week. Therefore, the children at the nursery station all grew up lively, clever, and healthy; there has never been an infectious disease or any serious illness.

The nursery station currently has twenty-one children. In addition, due to changes in the work of the children's parents, more than fifty children have left the nursery station one after another. Parents who have entrusted their children here all have a good impression of the nursery station. Cui Mali has been transferred to Beijing to teach, and she often writes letters to the nursery station's childcare workers. The father of child Tian Dabao was a Japanese national who worked in a machine factory last year. Because Tian Dabao's mother died, Tian Dabao later entered the nursery station and received enthusiastic care from the childcare workers. This April, Tian Dabao returned to Japan with his father. Before boarding the ship, Tian Dabao's father took Tian Dabao to buy a large bag of fruit and came to the nursery station to say goodbye, thanking the nursery station for taking care of Tian Dabao.

The three childcare workers working at the nursery station, although they are in semi-voluntary positions and their lives are relatively difficult, they all feel extremely honored because they are engaged in this cause that is beneficial to everyone, and they said that they will further improve the work of the nursery station.

    群众自己创办的一所托儿站
    新华社记者  赵玉昕
    天津四区六纬路托儿站，是当地居民自己创办的。从它成立以后，附近十几条街的劳动妇女就因为解除了孩子的牵累而能愉快积极地参加生产和工作；牙牙学语的幼儿，也不再因为妈妈上班走了而哭哭闹闹了。
    六纬路一带是劳动人民聚居的地方，现在许多私营工厂或小型的学校还没有托儿所的设备，妈妈去上班，家里的孩子就无人照管。住在十一经路的女教员崔玛利，经常把自己三周岁的女儿锁在屋里，等她下班回来，孩子已哭得声嘶力竭。有的工厂的女工，叫女儿休学来照料年幼的孩子。但是事实证明，用稍大的孩子来照料幼儿也不是一个妥善的办法。因此，建立托儿所已成为六纬路一带劳动妇女们迫切的要求。
    去年六月，住在本街的区人民代表会议代表傅重华，提议举办一个街道托儿所。他的提议受到当地居民热烈的支持，随即由居民代表、妇女代表和热心的人士六十三人组成了托儿站筹备委员会。妇女代表于秀华第一个报名愿意担当托儿站的义务保育员，曾受过保育工作训练的青年姑娘臧克敏、家庭妇女刘扬明也相继报名参加。居民徐文德自愿借出三间空房，其他的委员有的送床铺，有的送桌椅，锅碗瓢勺、暖壶、钟表等一切用具都准备齐全。医师许金栋并送来了一匹白布、十五斤棉花，为儿童们缝制了崭新的被褥。
    托儿站正式成立了，规定收容一周岁半到四周岁的孩子。每月费用六万五千元。开办初的第一个月，入站的儿童很少，只有崔玛利的女儿和另一个名叫白居强的男孩。别的母亲们怕这个托儿站办不好，怕保育员不会料理孩子，大家抱着观望的态度。一个月过去了，崔玛利的女儿体重增加了两公斤半，白居强也增加了两公斤，瘦尖的嘴巴变成圆圆的。托儿站召开了妈妈会，由这两个孩子的妈妈向其他妈妈作了报告。从此以后，要求送孩子入站的妈妈就多了起来，两个月后孩子增加到二十个。
    托儿站的保育员们细心照料着孩子，每天把孩子的饮食配制的很好，有鸡蛋、牛肉、蔬菜、排骨汤等；早上还喝豆浆。保育员根据儿童的年龄，进行各种教育，给孩子们讲故事，教唱歌，做体操等。当地居民对托儿站也经常关心：医师许金栋、许金钦兄妹和中医范炳麟等，每月对全站儿童进行一次义务体格检查，还负责对站内儿童进行日常的免费医疗。附近的妇女，每周都有人帮托儿站的孩子们洗被单。因此，托儿站的孩子们都长得活泼、伶俐、健康；没有发生过一次传染病或任何一件严重的疾病。
    托儿站现有二十一个儿童，另外，由于孩子们父母的工作变动，先后出托儿站的有五十多名儿童。在这里寄托过孩子的父母，都对这个托儿站有着良好的印象。崔玛利已调到北京教书，她还时常给托儿站的保育员来信。儿童田大宝的父亲，是个日籍侨民，去年在某机器厂做工，因为田大宝的妈妈死了，后来田大宝入了托儿站，受到保育员们热情地照顾。今年四月，田大宝已随父亲返回日本。临上船以前，田大宝的父亲带着田大宝买了一大包水果，来到托儿站告别，感谢托儿站对田大宝的照料。
    在托儿站工作的三位保育员，虽然是半义务职的，生活比较苦；但她们都因为自己从事了这件有利于大家的事业，感到莫大的光荣，她们表示要进一步改进托儿站的工作。
