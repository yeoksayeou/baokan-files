Reader's Letters Abstract

    Reader Visits in the Second Half of April
    From April 16th to 30th, our newspaper received a total of 115 visitors. During this half-month, the visitors were mainly municipal government staff, workers, and students. 80% of the questions raised by the visitors were resolved on the spot, and the rest have been forwarded to relevant parties for investigation.
    Worker Wu Zhihan came to our newspaper to talk about his experience: In July 1952, he worked at the 012 construction site of the former Central Directly Subordinate Engineering Company (the construction site is now under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau). At that time, mixing sand and ash on the construction site relied on manual labor, which was inefficient and tiring. After a long period of deliberation and research, Wu Zhihan created a simple sand and ash mixer. The experimental results were good, with a daily ash output of 130 to 150 cubic meters in eight hours, which increased work efficiency by one time compared to manual labor, and the quality increased by 50%. However, Liu Keguang, the site director of the work zone at that time, and Xiong Yunshan, the chairman of the labor union, did not support his creation. We believe that the creative enthusiasm of the working class is an immeasurable driving force for increasing production. Leading cadres should be good at cultivating, discovering, and supporting the creative enthusiasm of workers. Any indifferent and irresponsible attitude is intolerable. To handle this issue prudently, we have asked the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau to conduct a detailed inspection of this matter and respond to us.
    Another noteworthy issue is that Zhuang Ruihuan, a staff member of the Beijing Telecommunications Repair Factory of the Supply Bureau of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, came to report the chaotic production management in the factory. It is said that due to disregarding objective needs and blindly pursuing quantity, the factory produced 11,400 automatic exchange parts – rotary gears – last year, all of which were substandard and are still piled up in the warehouse, unable to be sold, resulting in an inventory of funds of over 360 million yuan. We have forwarded this issue to the Factory Management Section of the Supply Bureau of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for inspection and handling.
    In this half-month, there are still many who came to discuss disputes related to land rights, housing rights, creditor's rights, equity rights, and family matters. These are specific disputes that need to be handled and should be mediated by relevant departments based on the opinions of both parties or handled according to law. We cannot offer handling opinions based solely on the information provided by one party, so we have introduced them to relevant departments for resolution. In addition, eight people requested our newspaper's assistance in finding employment. Regarding labor employment issues, the government has clear regulations, and they have all been introduced to the local government labor departments for unified registration.

### 四月下半月读者来访情况

专栏：读者来信摘要

    四月下半月读者来访情况
    四月十六至三十日，本报共接待一百十五个来访的人。在这半个月中，来访的主要是本市机关工作人员、工人和学生。对于来访者所提出的问题，当面解决的占百分之八十，其余部分已转请有关方面调查。
    工人吴植涵来本报谈：一九五二年七月间他在前中央直属工程公司零一二工地工作（该工地现属北京市建筑工程局领导）。当时工地上搅拌砂子灰是依靠人工劳动，工作效率既低，人又很累。吴植涵经过长时间的琢磨和研究，创造了一种简便的砂子灰搅拌机，实验结果良好，出灰率每天八小时可达一三○立方公尺至一五○立方公尺，较人工工作效率提高一倍，质量提高百分之五十。但当时该工区现场主任刘克光、工会主席熊云深却对他的创造未予支持。我们认为，工人阶级的创造热情，是提高生产的不可估量的动力。领导干部应该善于培养，发现和支持工人的创造热情，任何冷淡和不负责任的态度都是不能容忍的。为慎重处理这个问题，我们已请北京市建筑工程局对这件事进行详细检查并答复我们。
    值得注意的问题还有：中央邮电部供应局北京电信修配厂工作人员庄瑞环前来反映该厂生产管理上的混乱现象。据称：该厂由于不顾客观需要，加之盲目追求数量，去年生产的自动交换机零件——回转齿一万一千四百个，全部不合规格，至今仍堆在仓库销售不出去，积压资金约三亿六千万元以上。这个问题我们已转请中央邮电部供应局工厂管理科检查处理。
    在这半月中，来谈有关地权、房权、债权、股权和家务等纠纷的仍然很多。这些问题是需要具体处理的纠纷问题，应由有关部门根据双方意见进行调解或依法处理，我们不能根据一方所反映的情况提出处理意见，所以都介绍他们到有关部门解决。此外，要求本报协助介绍职业的有八人。关于劳动就业问题，政府已有明文规定，都介绍到当地政府劳动部门进行统一登记。
