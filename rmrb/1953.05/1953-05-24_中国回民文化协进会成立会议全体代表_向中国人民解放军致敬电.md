    Telegram of Respect from All Representatives of the Founding Meeting of the Chinese Hui Muslim Culture Advancement Association to the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    To Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, you overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and liberated the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. Since liberation, you have steadfastly defended the motherland and protected the happy lives of the people of all ethnic groups. We, the Hui people, who have suffered greatly in the past, have unspeakable gratitude towards you.
    Your conscientious implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, your respect for the customs, habits, and religious beliefs of the Hui people, as well as your assistance to the Hui people in all aspects, are all things that we, the Hui people, will never forget.
    On the occasion of the founding of the Chinese Hui Muslim Culture Advancement Association, we hereby express our gratitude and love to you.
        All Representatives of the Founding Meeting of the Chinese Hui Muslim Culture Advancement Association
