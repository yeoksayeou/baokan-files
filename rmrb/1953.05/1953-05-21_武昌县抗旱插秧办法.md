Wuchang County's Methods for Fighting Drought and Transplanting Rice

    I. Protect seedlings and cultivate sprouts, ensuring that seedlings do not die from drought. Transplant rice early in fields with water. Early transplanting is one way to fight drought. In the past, Wuchang's Ninth District generally transplanted month-old seedlings. Now, seeing the drought, some are starting a week earlier, with the earliest transplanting 21-day-old seedlings. At the same time, for fields without water, they are leaving the seedlings, using reed mats to shade them from the sun and draining the water from the seedling fields to slow their growth, waiting for rain before transplanting. This allows them to wait a few more days, preventing the seedlings from growing too long.
    II. Develop water sources to increase drought resistance. Mobilize the masses to use methods appropriate to local conditions, such as digging ditches, building dams, and finding springs, to divert water for irrigation. In Fahua Township, Ninth District, 130 workers dug a ditch that irrigated 170 *shi* of land. In Fanhua Township, Second District, they dredged the Fanhua Ditch, drawing water from the inner river to irrigate the fields, enabling 800 *mu* of land to be irrigated and all the rice seedlings to be transplanted.
    III. Conserve water. Pump the water from the lowest fields to the higher fields, then release the water downwards layer by layer, transplanting rice layer by layer upwards. This saves a large amount of water. The Fourth District adopted this method, and the masses said:
    "It can maintain moisture for ten days to half a month longer."
    IV. Strengthen water conservancy management. Mobilize the masses to discuss reasonable water usage methods and formulate water usage covenants; inspect ponds and embankments, repair leaks, and plug gaps. Increase water retention capacity to avoid wasting a single drop of water.

    武昌县抗旱插秧办法
    一、护秧育苗，作到秧苗不被旱死。有水的田，争取早插秧。早插就是抗旱办法之一。武昌九区往年一般是栽满月秧，现在看到天旱，有的提前一星期左右，最早的栽二十一天的秧，同时留下无水田的秧，用芦席遮住太阳，放去秧田里的水，使秧长得慢，等待下雨后再插，这样可多等几天，秧不致长节。
    二、开辟水源，增加抗旱能力。发动群众因地制宜地用开沟、筑坝、找泉源等办法引水灌田。九区法华乡用一百三十个工开一条沟，就灌溉了一百七十石田。二区范湖乡疏通范湖沟，引内河的水灌田，使八百亩田灌上水，全部栽上秧。
    三、节约用水。把最低处的田里的水，车到上层的田里，然后逐层往下放水，逐层往上栽秧，这样可节省大量的水。四区采用这个办法，群众说：
    “可多保持十天到半月的水分。”
    四、加强水利管理。发动群众讨论合理用水办法，制定用水公约；检查塘堰，修补漏洞，堵塞缺口。增加保水能力，作到不浪费一滴水。
