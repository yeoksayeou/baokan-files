Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: TASS Moscow, May 21st: F. Orekhov, in an article entitled "A Quarrel Between Competitors" in "Pravda," discussed the endless pain and difficulties caused to British companies by the trade cooperation between American monopoly capital and them.

Orekhov said: When Pan American Airlines of the United States negotiated with Britain to purchase the British "Comet-III" jet passenger aircraft, the American authorities, under pressure from some American airlines planning to produce such aircraft, refused to recognize the certificate of airworthiness for the "Comet" aircraft issued in Britain. As a result, this seven million dollar deal fell through.

Orekhov pointed out: It will obviously be more difficult to sell British goods in the United States in the future. It is well known that the House Ways and Means Committee is already studying the bill proposed by Republican Congressman Simpson to strengthen American trade barriers. In addition, thirty-seven other bills aimed at restricting imports have also been submitted to Congress. American monopoly capital is using various methods to subdue its British rivals. On the one hand, they are rushing to expand the domestic production of synthetic rubber, which greatly reduces the dollar income earned by the sterling area from selling natural rubber to the United States. On the other hand, they prohibit Britain from selling goods (including rubber) to countries outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and invite Britain to sell goods only in the American market, which in practice does not accommodate British goods.

This invitation emphasizing American advantages is not just ironic. Representatives of the American business community, in order to "encourage" their British partners, often suggest that they "exert greater competitive effectiveness." However, the competition between Britain and the United States is so acute that even when exchanging "friendly opinions," the two competitors often quarrel and part on bad terms.

Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: Washington dispatch: Just as Western European countries such as Britain and France are asking the United States for "trade, not aid," many American business groups and their political representatives are vigorously campaigning for further "protectionist" measures in foreign trade.

In recent months, many American business groups and their agents in Congress have been vigorously advocating restricting imports of foreign goods under the pretext of protecting domestic industries, and demanding the abolition of the nineteen-year-old "Reciprocal Trade Act," which will expire in mid-June. The "protection" measures they advocate include further raising tariffs, implementing import quotas, and adopting a system of levying import taxes according to price fluctuations, etc.

At the end of March, Republican Congressman Richard Simpson, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee dealing with tariff legislation, introduced a bill stipulating that the Tariff Commission be given absolute power to raise tariff rates. According to a United Press report on the 18th, this bill is "rapidly gaining support." United Press explained: This is because "producers want to strengthen their position in the domestic market during a period of transition in international trade - that is, when the need is less urgent."

Enterprises requesting Congress to implement "protectionist" tariff policies include most American mining and other manufacturing industries, which are worried that competition from foreign goods will accelerate the decline of the unstable American industry and commerce. For example, the coal, lead and zinc industries are actively advocating protectionist policies, complaining about the current decline of their respective industries. Spokesmen for the wool and chemical industries have also asked the House Ways and Means Committee to pass bills restricting imports of foreign goods in order to "prevent bankruptcy." In addition, the same requests have been made by the dairy industry, tung oil industry, tuna industry, vegetable industry, hat-making industry, glass industry, screw manufacturing industry, silk weaving industry, photoplate industry, some metal mineral industries, part of the petroleum industry, and many other industries.

Due to the increasingly fierce competition in the capitalist world market and the increasing difficulty in selling American goods domestically, more and more industries are joining this group demanding "protection."

On the other hand, some monopoly groups with relatively consolidated monopoly markets at home and huge investments abroad are willing to appropriately relax import restrictions in order to obtain greater convenience in entering the markets of other countries as a condition. They believe that the strengthening of import restrictions by the United States will inevitably provoke retaliation from American "allies" who are already in great economic difficulty, and make it more difficult for their products to find customers with dollars abroad. Reflecting this aspect of the interests, Secretary of State Dulles said when testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee on May 4th: "If the Simpson bill, which tightens import controls, is passed... it will have serious consequences that will shake the entire free world structure."

In the context of differing opinions within the American bourgeoisie, the Eisenhower government has not yet put forward a trade policy that is any different from the past. It has only suggested that Congress extend the current "Reciprocal Trade Act" for one year in order to "study" the whole issue, which in practice facilitates the efforts of "protectionist" forces in Congress to propose and support the Simpson bill. "New York Times" reporter Reston admitted in a commentary on Eisenhower's approach on May 3rd that temporarily maintaining the "Reciprocal Trade Act" "is probably the best he (Eisenhower) can hope to do." Reston continued, due to increased competition, "the tension in the economic relations between the allies is expected to increase."

### 美英贸易“合作”害苦了英国  竞争日剧，美国企图用种种方法制服英国

    美英贸易“合作”害苦了英国
    竞争日剧，美国企图用种种方法制服英国
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：弗·奥列霍夫以“竞争者的争吵”为题，在“真理报”上发表文章，谈论美国垄断资本和英国公司进行贸易合作给后者造成无穷尽的痛苦和困难。
    奥列霍夫说：当美国泛美航空公司和英国谈判购买英国“彗星—三”式喷气载客机的时候，美国当局因为受到一些打算生产这类飞机的美国航空公司的压力，就拒绝承认“彗星”式飞机在英国领到的适于飞行证明书。结果，这一笔七百万美元的生意就没有成功。
    奥列霍夫指出：今后英国货在美国推销显然会更加困难。大家都知道，美国众议院筹款委员会已经在研究共和党议员辛普生所提出的要加强美国贸易壁垒的法案。另外还有三十七个目的在于限制入口的法案也已经提交给国会。美国垄断资本正在用种种方法来制服它们的英国劲敌。它们一方面急忙扩大国内人造橡胶的生产，这就使得英镑地区向美国推销天然橡胶而获得的美元收入大大减少。另一方面，它们又禁止英国把货物（包括橡胶在内）卖给北大西洋集团以外的国家，并且邀请英国只在实际上并不容纳英国货物的美国市场上销货。
    这种强调美国优势的邀请不仅是讽刺而已。美国商业界代表为了给他们的英国伙伴“打气”，还常常建议他们“发挥更大的竞争效能”。但是，英国和美国的竞争是如此尖锐。以至于两个竞争者即使是在交换“友好意见”时，也常常大吵一通，不欢而散。
    【新华社二十三日讯】华盛顿消息：正当英法等西欧国家向美国提出“要贸易、不要援助”的时候，美国许多企业集团和他们的政治代表在大力活动，要求在对外贸易上采取进一步的“保护”措施。
    最近几个月来，美国国内的许多企业集团及其在国会中的代理人以保护国内工业为理由，竭力鼓吹限制外国货进口，并要求废止将在六月中满期的已有十九年历史的“互惠贸易法”。他们主张采取的“保护”措施包括进一步提高关税、实行进口限额、采取按照价格涨落征收进口税的制度等等。
    三月底，美国众议院处理关税立法的筹款委员会的委员、共和党议员理查德·辛普生提出一项法案，规定给予关税委员会以提高关税税率的绝对权力。据合众社十八日消息，这个法案正在“迅速获得支持”。合众社解释说：这是由于“生产者都想在国际贸易的转变时期——即需要不太迫切的时候——来加强他们在国内市场中的地位”。
    要求国会实行“保护”关税政策的企业包括美国大多数矿业以及其他制造工业，它们担心外国货物的竞争会加速基础不稳的美国工商业的衰退。例如：煤、铅与锌业都积极主张采取保护政策，它们抱怨目前各业的衰落情况。毛织工业和化学工业的发言人也要求众议院筹款委员会通过限制外货进口法案，以“防止破产”。此外提出同样要求的还有牛奶业、桐油业、鲔鱼业、蔬菜业、制帽业、玻璃业、螺丝钉制造业、丝织业、照像制版业、若干金属矿物工业、一部分石油业以及其他许多行业。
    由于资本主义世界市场上竞争日益剧烈，而美国国内货物销路愈来愈有困难，参加这一要求“保护”的集团的行业愈来愈多。
    另一方面，在国内握有较巩固的垄断市场而在国外拥有巨额投资的一些垄断集团却愿意适当放宽入口限制，以便作为条件，取得打入其他国家市场的更大便利。它们认为，美国加强入口限制势必引起经济已十分困难的美国“盟国”的报复，并使它们的产品在国外更难找到有美元的主顾。反映这方面利益的国务卿杜勒斯五月四日在众议院筹款委员会作证时说：“如果通过加紧输入管制的辛普生法案……将产生动摇整个自由世界机构的后果，其影响非常严重。”
    在美国资产阶级内部意见纷纭的情况下，艾森豪威尔政府还没有提出一个什么和过去不同的贸易政策，它只是建议国会延长现行的“互惠贸易法”一年以便“研究”整个问题，实际上是便利了国会中“保护主义”势力提出和支持辛普生法案的努力。“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿在五月三日评论艾森豪威尔这种做法时承认，暂时维持“互惠贸易法”，“大约是他（艾森豪威尔）所能希望做到的最好的地步了”。赖斯顿继续说，由于竞争的增加，“预期盟国在经济方面的关系的紧张程度也将形增加”。
