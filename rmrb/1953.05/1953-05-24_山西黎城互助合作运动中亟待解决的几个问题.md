Several Problems Urgently Needed to be Solved in the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement in Licheng, Shanxi
    Wang Liangyu, Niu Xingjian
    We inspected the spring plowing production and mutual aid and cooperation movement in Licheng County and found that there were many problems in the mutual aid teams in the county that urgently needed to be solved.
    1. Mutual aid teams lack leading cadres. In Mengjiazhuang, Jinjiajie, Libao, Gangdongbei and other four villages in the first district, there are a total of 553 households. Four agricultural producers' cooperatives have a total of 165 households, accounting for 29 percent of the total households; 19 mutual aid teams have a total of 360 households, accounting for 65 percent of the total households; the rest are individual farmers. From this statistic, the members of mutual aid teams and individual farmers are more than twice the number of members of agricultural producers' cooperatives. However, in terms of leading cadres, there are very few backbones in the mutual aid teams. These four villages have a total of 70 party members, and 55 of them are participating in cooperatives. Most of the remaining 15 people are inactive party members. This situation shows that the current mutual aid teams lack leading cadres. The reason for this phenomenon is that the county leaders blindly develop agricultural producers' cooperatives. Generally, party member cadres believe that participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives can produce more and reduce troubles. Therefore, they are unwilling to stay outside the cooperatives to lead mutual aid teams. Another reason is that some party member cadres made mistakes of coercion and commandism when leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement, so that many people were unwilling to let party member cadres join their mutual aid teams. This has left many mutual aid teams in a state of drift.
    2. Blindly merging and expanding mutual aid teams. Developing from small to large is the development law of mutual aid teams, but many large teams in the county did not develop naturally, but were expanded in order to reduce burdens. In the past, when some business departments went to the countryside to promote new-style plows, waterwheels, medicines, and books and newspapers, they often forced sales to mutual aid teams without asking whether the masses needed them and whether they had the ability to purchase them. This made many mutual aid teams feel that the number of households was too small to bear the burden, and in order to cope with various disguised apportionments, they had to expand the teams. According to a preliminary survey of 21 villages, before a large number of cooperatives were established and means of production were promoted, there were a total of 220 mutual aid teams with 3,091 members. Each village had an average of 10 teams, and each team had an average of more than 14 households. At present, the 220 teams in these 21 villages have been merged into 96 teams. There are 2,960 team members (some team members have joined cooperatives). Each village has an average of four teams, and each team has an average of 30 households. After our research, these large mutual aid teams are ostensibly "laying the foundation for building cooperatives," but in fact, they are for reducing burdens. Mutual aid teams that are too large are difficult to manage and lack leading cadres, and it is easy to become a formality and hinder production.
    3. The principle of equivalent exchange has not been implemented. Some farmers have been affected by the blind establishment of cooperatives and feel that the fate of mutual aid teams is coming to an end. Therefore, they are not serious about implementing the equivalent exchange policy. In the first district, Yuancun implemented the equivalent exchange policy in the past few years, and eight teams used work points. Last year, these teams all became "Hanhou" teams, and five teams did not even use work points. Last year, Shangguihua Village in the first district had 17 mutual aid teams, which were merged into five teams in the name of "responding to the call of the higher authorities, merging teams and joining forces to lay the foundation for building cooperatives." These teams do not distinguish between busy and slack seasons, the weight of work, the strength of labor, and the level of technology. The uniform rate is six catties of rice per workday. Another reason is that although the farmers in the old liberated areas have long been familiar with the three major principles of organizing, they often cannot put them into practice and cannot give play to the role of the equivalent exchange policy as production develops. With the development of production, mutual aid teams have evolved from the initial mutual assistance to solve difficulties to the stage of mutual assistance in processing, mutual assistance in fertilizer application, and improving production, but many farmers still regard mutual aid teams as organizations to solve temporary labor shortages. They feel that it is difficult to implement equivalent exchange now, so they do not pay attention to it. Another reason is that farmers believe that equivalent exchange requires paying wages, and they generally have the idea of being afraid of paying wages. They do not know that mutual aid teams are mainly based on exchanging labor for labor, but at the end of a season, when settling work points, a small amount of wages must also be used to solve the problem of long deficits and short surpluses. In this way, the equivalent exchange policy is naturally not valued. Another reason is that the equivalent exchange methods of some mutual aid teams in the past were too complicated and troublesome. Some teams spent more work calculating accounts than they did in labor, so many people would rather suffer a little loss than cause such trouble. If this problem is not solved, the production efficiency of mutual aid teams will be difficult to improve.
    We also found a phenomenon: a small number of farmers withdrew from good mutual aid teams and joined backward mutual aid teams. The Yan Pangren mutual aid team in Tinghe Village has always been bad in the past, and there has been no improvement now, but the number of households in the team has increased from 15 to 23. The Lu Picheng mutual aid team used to be very good, but now only four households are left. It is said that the main reason for this phenomenon is that some farmers are afraid that good mutual aid teams will become cooperatives. In the final analysis, the masses believe that good teams have more troubles and are easy to delay production, so it is better to stay away than to get close. Although this phenomenon is currently small, it deserves enough attention.
    In order to solve the above problems well, we believe that the Licheng County Party Committee must conscientiously implement the central government's resolution on mutual aid and cooperation, not only to run agricultural producers' cooperatives well, but also to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams. At present, it is necessary to closely combine with production, continue to correct the blind and rash tendencies in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and solve various problems of mutual aid teams.

     山西黎城互助合作运动中亟待解决的几个问题
    王良玉  牛星检
    我们检查了黎城县的春耕生产和互助合作运动情况，发现该县互助组中有许多亟待解决的问题。
    一、互助组缺乏领导骨干。一区孟家庄、靳家街、李堡、港东北等四个村共有五百五十三户。四个农业生产合作社，共有一百六十五户，占总户数百分之二十九；十九个互助组，共有三百六十户，占总户数百分之六十五；其余是单干农民。从这个统计数看，互助组员和单干农民比农业生产合作社的社员多一倍多。但从领导骨干来看，互助组内的骨干很少。这四村共有党员七十人，参加社的有五十五人。其余十五人大部分是不起作用的党员。这个情况说明目前互助组是缺乏领导骨干的。造成这种现象的原因是县领导方面盲目发展农业生产合作社。一般党员干部认为参加农业生产合作社能多生产，少麻烦，因此，不愿留在社外领导互助组。另一原因是一些党员干部在领导互助合作运动时发生过强迫命令的错误，以致有不少群众不愿让党员干部参加他们的互助组。这就使得许多互助组陷于自流状态。
    二、盲目合并和扩大互助组。由小到大是互助组的发展规律，但该县的许多大组并不是自然发展起来的，而是为了减轻负担才扩大的。过去一些业务部门到农村去推广新式步犁、水车、药剂、书报时，往往不问群众是否需要和有无购买能力，硬以互助组为对象勉强推销。这样就使许多互助组感到户数少了负担不起，为了对付各种变象的摊派，只好将组扩大。据二十一个村的初步调查，在大量办社和推销生产资料之前，共有互助组二百二十个，组员三千零九十一户。每村平均十个组，每组平均十四户多。目前这二十一村的二百二十个组已并成了九十六个组。组员二千九百六十户（一部分组员入了社）。每村平均有四个组，每组平均三十户。经我们研究，这些大互助组表面上说是“为建社打基础”，实际上是为了减轻负担。互助组太大不好管理，又缺乏领导骨干，很容易流于形式妨害生产。
    三、等价原则没有贯彻。有些农民受了盲目建社的影响，感到互助组的命运快要结束了，因此执行等价政策就不认真了。一区原村在前几年还执行等价政策，八个组都使用工票。去年这些组都变成了“涵厚”组了，有五个组连工票也不用了。一区上桂花村去年有十七个互助组，以“响应上级号召、并组联队为办社打基础”为名，并成了五个组。这些组不分忙闲季节、工作轻重、劳力强弱、技术高低，一律是每工六斤米。另一种原因是老区农民虽然早已熟习组织起来的三大原则，但常不能实际运用，不能随着生产的发展而发挥等价政策的作用。随着生产的发展，互助组已由最初的互助起来解决困难进到互助加工、互助加肥和提高生产的阶段，但许多农民仍把互助组当作解决临时缺工困难的组织，他们感到现在实行等价不好办，就不注意执行了。再一个原因是农民认为等价就要出工资，而他们都普遍存在着怕出工资的思想。他们不知道互助组是以工换工为主，但在一个季节终了结算工票时，也必须以少量的工资解决长退短补问题。这样，等价政策自然也就不被重视了。再一个原因是以往有些互助组的等价办法太复杂、太麻烦。有的组算账误的工比劳动变的工还多，因此许多人宁愿吃点亏，也不愿惹这种麻烦。这个问题如不解决，互助组的生产效率很难提高。
    我们还发现了一种现象：有一小部分农民从好的互助组里退出来参加了落后的互助组。亭河村阎胖仁互助组过去一贯不好，现在也没什么改进，但组的户数已由十五户扩大到二十三户。路丕承互助组过去很好，但现在只剩下四户了。据说产生这种现象的主要原因是一部分农民怕好的互助组变成合作社。归根到底是群众认为好组麻烦多，容易耽误生产，所以靠近不如离远。这种现象目前虽是少量的，但值得引起足够注意。
    为了很好地解决上述问题，我们认为黎城县委必须认真执行中央的互助合作决议，既要把农业生产合作社办好，又应加强对互助组的领导。目前应紧密结合生产，继续纠正互助合作运动中的盲目冒进偏向和解决互助组的各种问题。
