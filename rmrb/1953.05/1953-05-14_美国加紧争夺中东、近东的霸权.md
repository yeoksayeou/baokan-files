The United States Intensifies the Struggle for Hegemony in the Middle East and Near East

While testifying before the Appropriations Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives on March 18, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles announced that the United States would "spend more money" in the Middle East. As is well known, since the end of the war, the U.S. government has been constantly using various "aid" methods to gradually infiltrate Middle Eastern countries economically, militarily, and politically, thereby squeezing out Britain and further expanding its influence in the Middle East. In the past seven years, the United States has provided a total of more than 229 million U.S. dollars in "loans," "grants," and "credit loans" to Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan; in the past four years, "aid" to Israel has reached more than 276 million U.S. dollars; from 1947 to 1951, various "aid" to Turkey exceeded 1 billion U.S. dollars; in 1952 alone, U.S. military and economic "aid" to the Middle East, Near East, and Africa amounted to 187 million U.S. dollars. And now the United States wants to "spend more money," which blatantly shows how the United States is intensifying its efforts to squeeze out Britain in an attempt to dominate the Middle East.

The sharpening of contradictions between the United States and Britain in the Middle East is particularly evident in the battle for oil. The Middle East's oil reserves are estimated to account for more than half of the capitalist world's total reserves; the oil wells in this region have particularly high production, with an average output per well being 100 times that of American oil wells. Therefore, American monopoly capital, aiming to obtain the highest profits, after seizing control of oil exploitation in Latin America from Britain, turned its attention to Britain's "oil fortress" in the Middle East.

Before World War II, the United States had already obtained special privileges to exploit oil in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and established oil companies. In 1946, Rockefeller's two oil companies signed a sales contract with the British-Iraq Petroleum Company, purchasing 20 percent of the British-Iraq Petroleum Company's total output, which was later increased to 40 percent. In 1948, the American Independent Oil Company obtained a lease in the "neutral zone" between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In 1949, the U.S. National Petroleum Company acquired shares of a French company's "Iraq Petroleum Company," thereby controlling the Iraq Petroleum Company. The "Aramco" company in Saudi Arabia, in order to get rid of the disadvantage of relying on British-Iraq Petroleum Company oil tankers to transport oil and being taxed by Britain when passing through the Suez Canal, wanted to lay a long pipeline that could directly transport oil to the Mediterranean coast. Britain desperately tried to prevent the realization of this plan. As a result, the United States and Britain launched a fierce struggle. In 1949 alone, in order to win and obstruct the pipeline from passing through Syrian territory, the United States and Britain successively manufactured three coups in Syria. In the end, the United States was victorious, and the pipeline was completed in 1950. This greatly increased the output of "Aramco," with its 1952 output being five times that of 1946, making it the company with the highest oil production in the Middle East.

In 1951, the British-Iraq Petroleum Company was nationalized by Iran. While jointly suppressing the growing anti-imperialist movement of the people of Middle Eastern countries with Britain and making every effort to prevent Iran from implementing the nationalization of the oil industry, the United States was also taking advantage of the contradictions between British imperialism and its affiliated countries in the Middle East, attempting to take the opportunity to squeeze out British forces and replace its position. The "mediation" activities that the United States has been constantly carrying out in Iran since April 1951 have been aimed at achieving this goal. The proposals made to the Iranian government in the name of the U.S. and British governments in August 1952 and February of this year clearly exposed this American conspiracy. Both proposals stated that Britain would abandon the British-Iraq Petroleum Company, with the United States lending money to the Iranian government to repay the "compensation" demanded by Britain, and a new oil company controlled by the United States would purchase and sell all of Iran's oil. At the same time, the United States took advantage of the situation after the British-Iraq Petroleum Company was nationalized to vigorously expand the Middle Eastern oil companies under its control. Therefore, in 1951, the Middle Eastern oil production controlled by the United States accounted for 66 percent of the total oil production in the Middle East and Near East, while Britain only accounted for 33 percent; before the war, Britain accounted for 80 percent, while the United States only accounted for 13 percent.

In the commodity sales market, the United States has also been making every effort to squeeze out Britain, which was greatly weakened in World War II, in various ways after the war. After the war, the United States used methods such as "technical assistance" to rapidly expand its economic power, making the sales volume of American goods in this region generally increase, and in countries such as Egypt, Iran, and Turkey, it has exceeded Britain, which has long held a dominant position there.

The United States' efforts to expand its political influence and seize important military bases can be exemplified by the situation in Egypt. The United States has been constantly taking advantage of the increasingly acute contradictions between Britain and Egypt over the stationing of troops in the Suez Canal Zone and the Sudan issue, trying to squeeze out Britain and expand American influence. The United States is also acting as a "mediator" here, just as it is in Iran. On the one hand, it is jointly suppressing the Egyptian people's movement to strive for national independence with Britain; on the other hand, it is also trying to gain benefits from the British-Egyptian dispute. As a result of a series of intense activities by the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Caffery, the British-Egyptian agreement on the Sudan issue signed in February of this year stipulates that the United States will participate in a committee to supervise the Sudanese parliamentary elections, thereby allowing the United States to directly interfere in Sudanese politics. On the issue of British troops stationed in the Suez Canal Zone, the so-called "U.S.-British joint proposal" put forward on March 14, on the one hand, stated that Britain would "complete its unconditional withdrawal" within one year, but at the same time insisted on establishing a military base in the Suez Canal Zone "for use by the Allied countries in the event of war," and that this base should be "supervised" by U.S. and British "experts" in peacetime. The intention of this proposal is obviously to turn the Suez Canal Zone, which was originally occupied solely by Britain, into a base jointly occupied by the United States and Britain. Before this, the United States had also proposed a plan for the withdrawal of British troops on the condition that Egypt participate in the so-called "Middle East Command," which also showed the United States' attempt to squeeze out Britain's sole occupation of the Suez Canal Zone in order to gain a foothold in this important strategic base.

The offensive of the United States to squeeze out British forces in the Middle East and Near East has achieved rapid development in a short period of time, which has made American monopoly capital increasingly disregard its "allies." The Wall Street mouthpiece "U.S. News & World Report" gleefully said: "In any case, Britain will no longer be able to play a leading role in the Near East, but it can become a junior partner of the United States." Britain has repeatedly expressed great anger and resistance to the fierce offensive of the United States. The British "Sunday Express" once called the plan proposed by the United States to resolve the Iranian oil issue "legalized robbery," and the "Truth" weekly called it "shameless deceit." According to the American "Newsweek" on March 9, a British official angrily said, "When the British retreat from somewhere in the world, the Americans are always ready to applaud." Currently, Dulles and Stassen, the director of the U.S. Mutual Security Agency, and Byroade, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian and African Affairs, are beginning their extensive activities in the Middle East and Near Eastern countries. This shows that the U.S. government is intensifying its efforts to seize control of the Middle East and Near East, which will inevitably make the contradictions between the United States and Britain in this region even more acute.

### 美国加紧争夺中东、近东的霸权

    美国加紧争夺中东、近东的霸权
    美国国务卿杜勒斯三月十八日在美国众议院拨款小组委员会上作证时宣布，美国要在中东“再多花一些钱”。大家知道，战后以来，美国政府已不断用给予各种“援助”的手段，从经济、军事、政治各方面逐渐侵入中东各国，从而排挤英国，进一步扩张它在中东的势力。美国在过去七年中，给埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克和外约旦的“贷款”、“赠款”和“信用贷款”共达二亿二千九百多万美元；在过去四年中，给以色列的“援助”达二亿七千六百多万美元；在一九四七到一九五一年当中，给土耳其的各种“援助”达十亿美元以上；单在一九五二年，美国对中近东和非洲的军事和经济“援助”就有一亿八千七百万美元。而现在美国还要“多花些钱”，这就十分露骨地表明美国正在怎样加紧排挤英国以图独霸中东了。
    美国和英国在中东的矛盾的尖锐化，特别明显地表现在对于石油的争夺战上。中东石油蕴藏量估计要占资本主义世界总蕴藏量的一半以上；这个地区油井产油量特别高，平均每个井的产油量为美国油井的一百倍。因此，以取得最高利润为目标的美国垄断资本，在拉丁美洲从英国手中夺取了开采石油的控制权以后，就把矛头指向英国在中东的“石油堡垒”。
    第二次世界大战以前，美国在中东就已在沙特阿拉伯和巴林群岛取得开采石油的特权，并开设了石油公司。一九四六年，洛克菲勒的两家石油公司又和英伊石油公司签订购销合同，购销英伊石油公司总产量的百分之二十，后来又增加到百分之四十。一九四八年，美国的独立石油公司在沙特阿拉伯和科威特之间的“中立区”获得了一块租借地。一九四九年，美国国家石油公司取得了一个法国公司的“伊拉克石油公司”股票，从而控制了伊拉克石油公司。美国在沙特阿拉伯的“阿美石油公司”，为了摆脱要依靠英伊石油公司油船运油并在通过苏彝士运河时被英国抽税的不利情况，就想敷设一条可直接输油至地中海海岸的长油管。英国拚命阻挠这个计划的实现。因而美英就展开了激烈斗争。单在一九四九年，为了争取和阻挠油管通过叙利亚国境，美国和英国先后在叙利亚制造了三次政变。最后是美国胜利，油管在一九五零年敷设完成。这就使“阿美石油公司”产量大增，一九五二年的产量为一九四六年的五倍，成为中东地区产油最多的一个公司。
    一九五一年，英伊石油公司被伊朗收为国有。美国一方面和英国共同镇压中东各国人民日益增涨的反对帝国主义运动，竭力阻挠伊朗实行石油工业国有化，但同时也在利用英帝国主义和它在中东的附属国的矛盾，企图趁机把英国势力排挤出去，取代它的地位。美国自一九五一年四月以来在伊朗不断进行的“调停”活动，都是为了达到这目的。一九五二年八月和今年二月间以美英两国政府名义向伊朗政府提出的建议，都清楚地暴露了美国的这种阴谋。这两个建议都说英国将放弃英伊石油公司，由美国借款给伊朗政府偿还英国所要求的“赔偿”，并由美国控制的新石油公司来购销伊朗的全部石油。同时，美国又趁英伊石油公司被收为国有后的情势，竭力扩充它控制下的中东石油公司。因此，在一九五一年，美国控制的中东石油产量已占中近东石油总产量的百分之六十六，英国只占百分之三十三；在战前，英国则占百分之八十，而美国只占百分之十三。
    在商品销售市场上，美国在战后也从各方面竭力排挤在第二次世界大战中被大大削弱了的英国。美国战后利用“技术援助”等手段迅速扩大了它的经济势力，使美国商品在这地区的销售数量普遍增加，在埃及、伊朗、土耳其等国并已超过了长久以来在那里占着优势地位的英国。
    美国力图扩张政治势力、争夺重要军事基地的活动，可以举在埃及的情况为例。美国一直不断利用英国和埃及在苏彝士运河区驻军及苏丹问题上的日益尖锐化的矛盾，设法排挤英国，扩张美国的势力。美国在这里也像在伊朗一样，戴着“调停人”的假面具在活动。一方面和英国共同镇压埃及人民的争取民族独立运动，另一方面也力图从英埃纠纷中取得利益。由于美国驻埃及大使卡弗里一连串紧张活动的结果，今年二月间签订的关于苏丹问题的英埃协定中，规定美国将参加监督苏丹议会选举的一个委员会，从而使美国可直接干预苏丹的政治。在关于苏彝士运河区英国驻军问题上，今年三月十四日提出的所谓“美英联合建议”，一方面说英国在一年内“无条件撤退完毕”，但同时却坚持在苏彝士运河区设立一个“在一旦战争爆发时可供盟国使用”的军事基地，而这个基地在平时应由美英
    “专家”进行“监督”。这个建议的用意，显然是要把本来是英国单独占领的苏彝士运河区，变成美英共同占领的一个基地。在这以前，美国还曾提出在埃及参加所谓“中东司令部”的条件下英军撤退的方案，这个方案也表明了美国力图排挤英国单独占领苏彝士运河区，以便插足于这个重要战略基地。
    美国在中近东排挤英国势力的攻势，在短时期内已取得迅速的发展，这就使美国垄断资本越来越不把它的“盟友”看在眼里了。华尔街喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”得意忘形地说：“无论如何，英国将不再能在近东担任领导角色了，但它可以成为美国的一个小伙计。”英国对于美国的凶猛进攻一再表示十分愤怒并进行抵抗。英国“星期日快报”曾把美国提出的关于解决伊朗石油问题的计划称为“合法化的抢劫”，“真报”周刊称之为“无耻的诓骗”。据三月九日的美国“新闻周刊”报道，一个英国官员愤愤地说，“当英国人从世界某地退却的时候，美国人总是准备拍手喝采的。”目前，杜勒斯和美国共同安全署署长史塔生，管理近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿拜娄德正在开始他们在中东、近东各国的广泛活动。这表明美国政府正加紧争夺对中近东的控制权，因而也必然使美英在这个地区的矛盾更加尖锐化。        （新华社）
