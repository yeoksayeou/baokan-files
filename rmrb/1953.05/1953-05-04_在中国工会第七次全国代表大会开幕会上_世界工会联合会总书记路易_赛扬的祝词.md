Dear Comrades:

    On behalf of the eighty million members united in the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions, I extend warm and friendly greetings to the delegates of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and to all the great and admirable workers of China.

    This Congress is an extremely important event in the national life of China and in the life of the international workers' movement; I sincerely hope that the Congress will achieve the greatest success.

    First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which has provided valuable assistance and constant support to the World Federation of Trade Unions and its industrial departments. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions actively participates in the international workers' movement and demonstrates its loyalty to international solidarity through numerous practical actions. It holds high the banner of proletarian internationalism in Asia and Australia, under which workers in capitalist and colonial countries fighting against exploiters have joined their brothers and sisters in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, forming a world workers' struggle front advancing towards the bright socialist road.

    Workers all over the world are watching with great sympathy the achievements of the Chinese people in building a new country, in which the people are masters and are therefore protected.

    Dear Chinese comrades, the initial successes in your creative work have surely paved the way for even greater successes. Under the leadership of your beloved and respected leader, the glorious leader of the Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong, you have embarked on this path.

    We are very pleased to see that China is making progress day by day. The Chinese workers can be proud of the cause they have accomplished with all their strength and boundless patriotic enthusiasm.

    In the cause of creating this happy new life, the Chinese people have absorbed the great historical lessons and successful experiences of the Soviet people, and the happy new life is a solid foundation for building socialism. The Soviet people, for the first time in human history, pointed out that capitalism will neither prevail universally nor exist forever. The October Revolution of 1917 created a new era of socialism and unfolded new prospects for all mankind.

    Comrades:

    While you Chinese men and women workers are gaining new victories day after day on the road to a better life, the situation of workers in capitalist, semi-colonial, and colonial countries is completely different. In these countries, poverty is increasing day by day. People's families are mired in extreme poverty, and unemployment is expanding. In some countries, existing social undertakings have been undermined, and social legislation has become a constant problem. The working class, the working-class fighters, and organizations are all being suppressed.

    The living conditions of millions of men and women workers have become increasingly unbearable, while the profits of monopoly capital have accumulated to astonishing peaks. That is why the workers' struggle for the fulfillment of their demands has greatly developed in the recent period. The workers' unified action is becoming more and more extensive, so that their struggle is more offensive.

    The numerous major strikes that have recently taken place in Japan, the many strikes in India and other Southeast Asian countries, and all kinds of specific struggles against layoffs and reductions in real wages all indicate that this mass action is developing actively.

    In every event, this workers' struggle to fulfill their demands is closely combined with the people's actions to fight for national independence and defend peace.

    So, what are the characteristics of the environment in which the World Federation of Trade Unions' actions and the workers' struggle actions are developing in these capitalist and colonial and semi-colonial countries? Regarding this question, we can answer with the following points:

    (1) The continuous struggle of the working masses to fight for a better life, to fight for peace and national independence, has made the ruling classes of capitalist countries openly destroy their own bourgeois legislation; those bourgeois laws are no longer sufficient to protect the ruling classes from the legitimate demands of the working people. Therefore, these ruling classes are increasingly resorting to anti-democratic, anti-labor barbaric suppression. They are turning their countries into police states, specializing in protecting the privileges of their class.

    These ruling classes are attempting to establish and promote a new legislation, one of the foundations of which is political and social discrimination with fascist characteristics.

    (2) The contradictions of interest between these capitalist countries are growing and becoming more blatant than in previous years, and other various contradictions are also rapidly maturing. These are the direct result of the intolerable world hegemony that American imperialism is trying to implement.

    Faced with the insatiable conflicts of interest of the capitalists, the working class and their advanced organizations and trade unions are launching struggles on the basis of proletarian internationalism. In every country, the working class has strengthened its unity with the peasants, intellectuals, and progressive elements of the national bourgeoisie. Therefore, the people's fierce struggle for democratic rights and immediate demands is combined with the equally high-spirited struggle for national independence.

    (3) The conflicts between the people of the colonial and semi-colonial countries and the governments of the colonial countries are growing and becoming increasingly acute, and in recent years have expanded to new regions. The traditional and existential foundations of the entire colonial system have begun to shake, and the colonial and feudal systems are being openly opposed by countless millions of people.

    These struggles have confirmed the estimate we made earlier, right here in Beijing, at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference held in mid-November 1949, regarding the role and tasks of trade unions.

    In colonial and semi-colonial countries, when trade unions actively participate in the people's resistance movement against colonialism and become an important foundation for launching mass movements, trade unions can become a truly national force.

    This makes the colonialists intend to completely subordinate the trade unions to their policies, but they are encountering increasing difficulties. We should be confident that the period of comprehensive and full development of the trade union movement is coming, which will be the time when the people, with rising patriotic power, break free from imperialist rule and colonial slavery.

    Supporting this great and historically significant struggle of the people for national independence and liberation is the glory and pride of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    It is the glory and pride of the World Federation of Trade Unions to stir up a huge wave of international solidarity to help the complete liberation of the colonial people.

    It is the glory and pride of the World Federation of Trade Unions to stand with the Korean people, united as solid as a rock, against the aggression of American imperialism since June 25, 1950.

    For three years, the World Federation of Trade Unions has continuously supported the venerable Korean people through action. Please allow the representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions to express the same gratitude and the same respect on this platform to the fighting Korean people and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The peace proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea last month proved the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the entire Korean issue, and all the people of Asia and other continents warmly welcomed this proposal.

    Today, the facts have once again proven that no international dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation and consultation. We are currently living in an extremely important period, related to the fate of our generation and several generations to come. The World Federation of Trade Unions, at its 22nd Executive Bureau meeting held in Vienna a week ago, called on workers on all continents to redouble their efforts and use all pressure to strive for an immediate ceasefire in Korea and a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions, representing the will of these masses of people, believes that the recent discussions on the Korean issue at the United Nations have made it imperative for the United Nations to take truly effective measures to establish peace in Korea.

    If the United Nations does not take this effective path, it will forever lose its prestige in the eyes of all mankind. It is a great pity that the United Nations has used its flag to cover up the imperialist actions against the Korean people, but the United Nations can still become an instrument of peace serving the people. To this end, it should first fulfill its responsibilities when it was founded in 1945.

    Then the United Nations should, without delay, change its past weak attitude and give the Central Government of the People's Republic of China the position that the great Chinese people deserve in the United Nations organization.

    If the people themselves grasp the cause of peace and defend it to the end, they can, through joint efforts, make 1953 a milestone, thereby strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries, establishing peaceful relations between countries, regardless of their social system, and making 1953 the starting point for the imminent cause of peace.

    Trade unions have a special role to play in peaceful coexistence. Trade unions can encourage the establishment of economic policies based on broad trade relations in their own countries, in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries, thereby opposing the discriminatory policies currently implemented by imperialism.

    Due to this special action, trade unions' participation in the struggle for national independence and national liberation becomes practical and concrete.

    Comrades:

    We believe that the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is extremely important, one of the reasons being that it is held five months before the World Trade Union's Third Congress to be held in Vienna this October.

    The Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions will be a congress that can truly represent the men and women workers of the world.

    This congress will be a congress of solidarity and unity, and trade union organizations that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions but are willing to defend the interests of the working people and the cause of peace can participate in the congress.

    On April 22, the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions called on workers around the world to prepare for the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. With what attitude does the World Federation of Trade Unions speak to the working people and trade union organizations of the world, whether or not these organizations have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions?

    The World Federation of Trade Unions speaks to them with a comrade's attitude, a friendly attitude, and an attitude of mutual assistance and care. The World Federation of Trade Unions says to them:

    "Dear Comrades:

    We live in different countries. We represent all races, all nationalities, all political factions, and all religious beliefs in the world. We speak different languages, but we have common interests because we are brothers and sisters of the class. We are united in the belief that everyone has the right to work. We believe that the living conditions of workers in capitalist and colonial countries are constantly deteriorating, and we believe that we should fight to improve these conditions; we are united in this belief.

    "We believe that in countries where there is already social legislation, this legislation should be improved, and in countries where there is no such legislation, it should be strived for; we are united in this belief. We believe that super-exploitation should be eliminated, and discrimination based on race, skin color, gender, and age should be abolished; we believe that public health should be improved and education should be developed; we believe that no one has the right to prohibit the legitimate actions of trade unions; we believe that a person's basic and sacred democratic freedoms and rights should not be deprived in any way; we are united in these beliefs.

    "In short, we are united in the belief that peace can be guaranteed and war can be avoided.

    "Therefore, we have a broad basis for unity. If we want to be victorious in our struggle, we should take common action based on this common purpose and common interests. Wherever workers can unite, success is assured.

    "The World Federation of Trade Unions has always considered the struggle to strive for the international unified action of workers as its primary task. The World Federation of Trade Unions has always encouraged workers to take such solidarity and such action.

    "When you are preparing for the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions at various work sites, you should turn this congress into a congress of unity for workers from all countries around the world."

    Indeed, no other organization can speak to the workers of the world in this way; the splitters in the ranks of the trade union movement, they are supporters of imperialist policies: they support the colonial and semi-colonial system because their interests are consistent with the policies and actions of the imperialist government, they cannot say this to the workers of all countries in the world.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions understands the responsibilities it bears before the workers of the world. We are not only responsible for the eighty million members of the World Federation of Trade Unions, not only for the workers who have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    We are increasingly aware of the following: that whenever workers in capitalist, semi-colonial, and colonial countries take action, regardless of whether they have joined a trade union organization, regardless of whether the trade union organization they have joined is a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, they unanimously take the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions as their banner, the main parts of the World Federation of Trade Unions program as their program, and the action methods formulated by the World Federation of Trade Unions as their action methods regarding the necessity of their struggle, the motives for their struggle, and the conditions they create for success.

    This means that the World Federation of Trade Unions is also responsible for the actions of members of trade unions that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    We gladly accept such responsibility because it proves that the unified action of workers in various countries is developing and that the international unified action is moving forward.

    We would like to point out once again that unified action is the foundation for the success of all trade union activities and the actions of men and women workers.

    To achieve unified action in all places, this is the fundamental task of decisive significance in the trade union movement today.

    Therefore, helping countries achieve unified action and a unified trade union movement is the fundamental position of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    No matter where they are, all friends and participants of the World Federation of Trade Unions should take this fundamental position as the starting point for their actions and always respect this position; they should constantly provide new forms of proactive solidarity and create various conditions for broad mass unity.

    The task of trade unions and their leaders lies in: never separating from the masses of workers and constantly raising their class consciousness through various struggles and accumulated experience.

    The task of trade unions and their leaders lies in learning from the masses and in the masses.

    In the work of preparing for the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, we put the work of uniting workers in the first place, and we will carry out the unified movement with greater efforts, exposing the anti-labor and anti-democratic policies of the mortal enemies of the solidarity movement in front of the masses of workers.

    Long live the solidarity of workers all over the world and their international unity!

    Long live the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions!

    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, an active fighter for peace between peoples, for national independence, democratic freedom, and for the welfare of the working people of the world!

    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, leader of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people!

### 在中国工会第七次全国代表大会开幕会上  世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬的祝词

专栏：

    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会开幕会上
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬的祝词亲爱的同志们：
    我谨代表团结在世界工联行列内的八千万会员，向中国工会第七次全国代表大会的各位代表以及伟大的和值得敬佩的中国所有的工人，致以热烈的、友谊的敬礼。
    在中国国民生活中，在国际工人运动的生活中，这一次的代表大会都是一件极端重要的事件；我热烈地希望代表大会获得最大的成功。
    在这个讲坛上，首先我要深深感谢中华全国总工会，它对世界工联以及世界工联的各产业部都曾给予宝贵的援助与经常的支持。中华全国总工会积极参加国际工人运动，并以无数的实际行动来表示它忠于国际的团结。它在亚澳各国高举起无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，在这一旗帜之下，为反对剥削者而进行斗争的资本主义及殖民地国家的工人，已和苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的兄弟姊妹并列一起，形成走向光明的社会主义道路的世界工人斗争阵线。
    全世界的工人以极大的同情，注视着中国人民在建设新国家中的成就，在新国家中，人民作了主人，因而也受到了保护。
    亲爱的中国同志们，你们创造性的工作中的初步成功，已肯定为你们开辟了更伟大的成功的道路。在你们爱戴而尊敬的领袖、光荣的共产党领导人毛泽东同志的领导下，你们已经走上了这一条道路了。
    我们很愉快地看见中国日益在进步着。中国工人对他们以全部力量和无限爱国的热情所完成的事业，是可以引为骄傲的。
    中国人民在创造这一幸福的新生活的事业中吸取了苏联人民的伟大的历史教训与成功的经验，而幸福的新生活是建设社会主义的可靠的基础。苏联人民，在人类历史上第一次指出资本主义既不会普遍存在，也不会永远存在。一九一七年的十月革命创造了社会主义的新纪元，展开了全人类的新的远景。
    同志们：
    正当你们中国的男女工人们在迈向一个更美好的生活的道路上，日复一日地获得新的胜利的时候，资本主义、半殖民地与殖民地国家工人的处境是完全不同的。在这些国家中，贫困日益增加。人民的家庭陷于极大的贫困，失业的现象日益扩大。在有些国家中，原有的社会事业遭到了破坏，社会立法也不断成了问题。工人阶级，工人阶级的战士和组织都遭受着镇压。
    几百万男女工人的生活条件已日益不堪忍受，而独占资本的利润则已累积到了惊人的最高峰。这就是为什么工人争取满足要求的斗争在最近一个时期大大地发展了。工人的统一行动越来越广泛，以致他们的斗争更具有进攻性。
    最近在日本发生的多次大罢工，印度和其他东南亚各国的好多次罢工，一切反对解雇，反对降低实际工资的各种具体斗争都表明这个群众性的行动积极地发展了。
    在每次事件中，这种工人争取满足要求的斗争和人民争取民族独立、保卫和平的行动，巩固地结合在一起。
    那末，在这些资本主义与殖民地、半殖民地国家中，世界工联的行动和工人的斗争行动得以发展的环境，究竟具有那些特点呢？关于这个问题，我们可以用以下的各点来回答：
      （一）工人群众为争取更好的生活，为争取和平与民族独立而进行的不断的斗争，已使资本主义国家的统治阶级不惜公开地破坏他们资产阶级自己的立法；那些资产阶级的法律已不足保护统治阶级来反对劳动人民的合法要求。因此这些统治阶级就日甚一日地求救于反民主、反劳工的野蛮镇压。他们把他们的国家变成警察国家，专门保护着他们阶级的特权。
    这些统治阶级企图建立并推广一种新的立法，这种立法的基础之一就是具有法西斯性质的政治与社会方面的歧视。
    （二）这些资本主义国家之间的利益上的矛盾正在增长，并较过去几年更为露骨，还有其他的各种矛盾也在迅速地成熟中，这些都是由于美帝国主义强欲实行的令人无法容忍的世界霸权的直接结果。
    面临着资本家贪得无厌的利益冲突，工人阶级和他们的先进组织以及工会，就在无产阶级国际主义的基础上展开了斗争。在每一个国家中，工人阶级都加强了自己和农民、知识分子以及民族资产阶级进步阶层之间的团结，因此，人民为争取民主权利和切身要求的炽烈的斗争，就和同样高涨的争取民族独立的斗争结合起来了。
      （三）各殖民地和半殖民地国家的人民和各殖民国政府之间的冲突，正在增长和日益转剧，并在最近几年中更扩大到新的地区。整个殖民主义制度的传统和生存的基础已开始动摇，殖民主义体系和封建体系正遭受到无数百万人民群众的公开反对。
    这些斗争已证实了，我们以前，就在这里——北京，在一九四九年十一月中召开的亚洲澳洲工会代表会议上，所作的有关工会的作用和任务的估计。
    在殖民地及半殖民地的国家中，当工会积极地参与了反对殖民主义的人民抵抗运动，并成为开展群众运动的重要基础的时候，工会就能成为真正民族性质的力量。
    这就使殖民主义者意欲将工会完全屈从于他们的政策，但是他们正遭受到日益增长的困难。我们应该确信，工会运动全面而充分发展的时期即将到来，这将是人民以高涨的爱国力量挣脱帝国主义统治和殖民地奴役的时候。
    支持这种人民的伟大而有历史意义的、争取民族独立与解放的斗争，是世界工联的光荣和骄傲。
    鼓动起国际团结的巨大潮流来帮助殖民地人民的全部解放，是世界工联的光荣和骄傲。
    从一九五○年六月二十五日起，和团结得像岩石一样坚强的朝鲜人民在一道，来反对美帝国主义的侵略，是世界工联的光荣和骄傲。
    三年来，世界工联不断地以行动积极支持可敬爱的朝鲜人民。请允许世界工联的代表在这个讲台上，向战斗的朝鲜人民和英勇的中国人民志愿军致以同样的感谢和同样的敬意。
    前一个月，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的和平建议，证明了和平解决整个朝鲜问题的可能性，亚洲以及其他各洲的所有人民对这一建议是热烈欢迎的。
    今天，事实已再一次地证明，没有任何国际纠纷是不可能用谈判和协商方法解决的。我们目前是生活在一个极端重要的时期，关系到我们这一代和以后若干代的命运。世界工联在一星期前于维也纳举行的第二十二次执行局会议上，曾号召各洲工人加倍努力，以一切压力争取朝鲜立即停战，和平解决朝鲜问题。
    世界工联代表这些人民群众的意志，认为联合国最近关于朝鲜问题的讨论，已使联合国必须采取真正有效的措施以建立朝鲜的和平。
    如果联合国不走这条有效的道路，它将在全世界人类的眼前永远失掉它的威信。联合国以它的旗帜遮掩帝国主义对朝鲜人民的行为，这是我们很惋惜的，但是联合国现在仍然可以变为服务于人民的和平工具。为此，它首先应当履行它一九四五年创立时所负的责任。
    然后联合国应当毫不延迟地改变它过去软弱的态度，给与中华人民共和国的中央政府在联合国组织中以伟大的中国人民应有的地位。
    如果人民自己掌握和平事业，并把和平事业保卫到底，他们就能够以共同的努力使一九五三年成为一个里程碑，由此加强各国人民之间的友谊合作，建立各国间的和平的关系，不论其社会制度如何，使一九五三年成为迫不容缓的和平事业的起点。
    在和平共处方面，工会有它的特殊作用。工会可以在自己的国家，在资本主义、殖民地及半殖民地的国家内，鼓励建立以广泛的贸易关系为基础的经济政策，以此反对帝国主义目前所实行的歧视政策。
    由于这种特殊行动，工会参加民族独立与民族解放的斗争就变得切实而具体了。
    同志们：
    我们认为中国工会第七次全国代表大会极其重要，原因之一，就是它举行的日期是在本年十月将于维也纳举行的世界工会第三次代表大会前的五个月。
    世界工联召开的世界工会第三次代表大会将是真正能代表全世界男女工人的代表大会。
    这次大会将是一次团结、统一的大会，那些没有参加世界工联、但是愿意保卫劳动人民利益与和平事业的工会组织都可以参加大会。
    四月二十二日，世界工联执行局曾经号召全世界工人筹备世界工会第三次代表大会。对于全世界的劳动人民以及全世界的工会组织，无论这些组织是否加入世界工联，世界工联是以甚么态度说话呢？
    世界工联是以同志的态度、友谊的态度、互助关怀的态度说话。世界工联向他们这样说：
    “亲爱的同志们：
    我们住在不同的国家。我们代表世界上各种种族、各种国籍、各种政治派别以及各种宗教信仰。我们说着不同的语言，但我们有着共同的利益，因为我们是阶级的弟兄。我们在每个人都有工作权利的信念中团结起来了。我们相信资本主义和殖民地国家工人的生活条件在不断地恶化，我们相信应当斗争来争取改善这些条件；我们是在这一信念中团结起来了。
    “我们相信在现在已有社会立法的国家，这些立法还应当改善，在没有这些立法的国家，应当争取建立这一立法，我们在这一信念中团结起来了。我们相信超级剥削应当消灭，种族、肤色、性别、年龄的歧视应当废除；我们相信公共卫生应当改善、教育应当发展；我们相信没有任何人有权利禁止工会的合法行动；我们相信一个人的基本的和神圣的民主的自由和权利不应当受到任何剥夺；我们是在这些信念中团结起来了。
    “总之，我们是在相信和平可以保障、战争可以避免的信念中团结起来了。
    “因此我们有广泛的团结基础。如果我们要在我们的斗争中取得胜利，我们应当根据这种共同的目的和共同的利益来采取共同的行动。凡是工人能够团结的地方，成功便是有把握的。
    “世界工联一向认为争取工人们的国际统一行动的斗争，是它的首要任务。世界工联一向在鼓动工人采取这样的团结和这样的行动。 “你们在各工作现场筹备世界工会第三次代表大会的时候，应当把这一个代表大会变成全世界各国工人的统一的代表大会。”
    的确，没有任何其他组织能够对全世界工人这样讲话；工会运动行列中的分裂分子，他们是帝国主义政策的拥护者：他们支持殖民地和半殖民地制度，因为他们与帝国主义政府的政策和行动的利害是一致的，他们就不能够对世界各国工人这样说。
    世界工联了解它在全世界工人面前所担负的责任。我们不只对世界工联的八千万会员负责，不只对加入了世界工联的工人们负责。
    我们越来越注意到下列这一件事：即不论他们是否加入了一个工会组织，不管他们所加入的工会组织是否世界工联的会员，每当资本主义、半殖民地以及殖民地国家的工人们采取行动时，关于他们的斗争的必要性，他们进行斗争的动机以及他们为求成功而创造的条件，他们一律以世界工联的旗帜为他们的旗帜，以世界工联纲领的主要部分为他们的纲领，并以世界工联所拟订的行动方法为他们的行动方法。
    这就是说世界工联对那些未参加世界工联的工会的会员的行动也负有责任。
    我们愉快地接受这样的责任，因为这证明各国工人的统一行动正在发展着，国际间的统一行动也在向前推进着。
    我们愿再一次地指出，统一行动是一切工会的活动和男女工人们的行动的成功的基础。
    在各地实现统一行动，这就是今天工会运动中具有决定意义的基本任务。
    因此帮助各国实现统一行动和统一的工会运动就是世界工联的基本立场。
    无论任何地方，凡是世界工联的朋友和参加者都应以这个基本立场为行动的出发点并始终尊重这个立场；都应不断地提供主动团结的新的形式，创造群众广泛团结的各种条件。
    各工会及其领导人的任务在于：永远不脱离工人群众，并通过各种斗争以及日积月累的经验，不断地提高他们的阶级觉悟。
    各工会及其领导人的任务在于向群众并在群众中学习。
    在筹备世界工会第三次代表大会的工作中，我们把团结工人的工作放在首要地位，我们将以更大的努力来开展统一运动，在工人群众面前揭发团结运动死敌们的反劳工、反民主的政策。
    全世界工人团结和他们国际间的团结万岁！
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会万岁！
    争取实现各国人民间的和平，争取民族独立、民主自由和保卫全世界劳动人民的福利的积极战士——世界工联万岁！
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
