    Editor's Note: Guo Zhongtian, a first-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, is now studying at a rapid literacy school. Before entering the school, he only knew four hundred characters. After half a year of study, he can now recognize two thousand characters. This article was written by him in his own hand to celebrate "June 1st" International Children's Day. We have only made minor changes to individual words and sentences.

    "June 1st" Children's Day is coming. On this festival, I happily congratulate the happy children living in the motherland. This festival also reminds me of many unforgettable things. I remember once, our troops were stationed at Kim Da-niang's house in a small Korean town. She had three children, all in their teens. In conversation, I inadvertently asked her, "Da-niang, why don't you let your children study?" She sighed and said, "Comrade, look at what the American devils have done to us. We don't even have a house to live in, so where can we find a school to study?" At that time, I deeply realized that the peaceful life of the Korean people was being destroyed, and Korean children could not go to school, all because of the American robbers. From the unfortunate experiences of Korean children, I thought of the children of the motherland growing up in the Mao Zedong era, who have food to eat, clothes to wear, and opportunities to go to school. How happy they are!

    I remember in 1952, when I returned to China to give a report in Hankou, many Young Pioneers presented me with flowers. Among them, a twelve-year-old girl ran up to me with a bouquet of flowers and said, "Volunteer Army Uncle, our happy life was given to us by Chairman Mao and also by you uncles. We can live a happy life in this peaceful environment and study with peace of mind because you uncles are protecting us. Uncle, this bouquet of flowers represents the heart of millions of happy children to you. Uncle, please be sure to take our heart back and tell all the Volunteer Army uncles on the Korean front that we love peace and we hate the invaders who want to destroy our peaceful and happy life the most." She continued, "Uncle, I also have a very beautiful notebook to give you. This is what I bought with the one thousand yuan my mother gives me for lunch every day, because I thought of the Volunteer Army uncles bleeding and sacrificing on the Korean front, eating snow and fried noodles, and sometimes not eating anything at all. What is this for? Isn't it to defend our beloved motherland and our happy life? So I didn't eat lunch for ten days and saved ten thousand yuan to buy this notebook to give to you as my personal consolation to the Volunteer Army uncles. Please write down your heroic deeds in this notebook and give it back to me when you return home victoriously. How happy I will be then!" At that time, I thought: Why is this little girl able to do this? The reason is very simple, just as she herself said, the children of the motherland all love peace. Only with peace can they have happiness. When I received the notebook that she bought with her ten days' lunch money and gave to me, I was so moved that tears flowed down my face. This precious gift shows how much the children of the motherland love the Volunteer Army, especially her words to me to pass on to all the Volunteer Army: "We love peace, and we hate the invaders who want to destroy our peaceful and happy life the most." These two sentences impressed me the most. These are such sincere and powerful words! I will always remember them! It can be imagined how much hope the peace-loving people of the motherland place in us. At that time, I felt as excited as I did every time I received a combat mission from my superiors at the front, and I deeply felt how glorious and responsible it was to be a Volunteer Army soldier!

    After receiving this little girl's precious gift and hearing her words, I immediately replied solemnly: "Dear little friend: Please rest assured! We are determined to wipe out the American invaders on the Korean battlefield; we are confident in safeguarding the safety of the great people of the motherland and the happy life of the children of the motherland; at the same time, we have the determination and confidence to relieve the suffering of the Korean people and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world!"

    我永远记住孩子的话
    郭忠田
    编者按：中国人民志愿军一级战斗英雄郭忠田同志，现在一所速成学校里学习。他在入校前只认识四百字，经过半年的学习，现在已能认识两千字了。这篇文章，就是他为庆祝“六一”国际儿童节亲笔写的，我们只作了个别字句的改动。
    “六一”儿童节来到了，在这个节日，我以欢快的心情为生活在祖国的幸福的儿童祝贺。在这个节日，同时也使我想起了许多难忘的事情。记得有一次，我们部队住在一个朝鲜小镇上的金大娘家里，她有三个孩子，都是十几岁。在谈话中我无意地问她：“大娘，怎样不叫你的孩子读书呢？”她“唉”了一声说：“同志，你看看美国鬼子把我们糟踏成什么样子了，连房子都没有得住，那里还能找到学校念书呢？”当时我深刻地体会到，朝鲜人民的和平生活被破坏，朝鲜儿童念不成书，这完全是美国强盗一手造成的。从朝鲜儿童的不幸的遭遇，我联想起生长在毛泽东时代的祖国儿童，有吃有穿有机会上学，是多么幸福啊！
    记得是在一九五二年，有一次我归国在汉口作报告的时候，很多少年儿童队队员向我献花，其中有一个十二岁的小女孩，拿着一把鲜花跑到我跟前说：“志愿军叔叔，我们的幸福生活，是毛主席给的，也是叔叔们给的。我们能在这和平的环境里过幸福生活，安心学习，就是因为有叔叔们在保护着我们。叔叔，这把花，是代表着千百万幸福儿童的一颗心来向叔叔献的。叔叔，请你一定把我们这个心意带回去告诉朝鲜前线所有的志愿军叔叔们，让他们都知道我们是热爱和平的，我们最痛恨的是那些要想破坏我们的和平幸福生活的侵略者。”她又接着说：“叔叔，我还有一个很漂亮的小本子送给你。这是我用母亲每天给我的一千元吃午餐的钱买的，因为我想到志愿军叔叔们在朝鲜前线流血牺牲，吃雪吃炒面，甚至有时啥也吃不着，这是为了什么呢？还不是为了保卫可爱的祖国和我们的幸福生活吗？所以我就十天没吃午餐，节省下一万块钱，买这个小本子送给叔叔，作为我个人对志愿军叔叔的慰问。请你把你们的英雄事迹都写在这个本子上，等你们胜利凯旋回国时再送给我，那时候我该多么高兴啊！”当时我想：这个小女孩为什么能够这样做呢？道理很简单，正是她自己所说的，祖国的儿童们都是热爱和平的。只有和平才有他们的幸福。当我接过她用十天的午餐费买来赠给我的那个小本子时，我被感动得流出了热泪。这个珍贵的礼物说明了祖国的儿童多么热爱志愿军，特别是她让我转告全体志愿军的话：“我们是热爱和平的，我们最痛恨的是那些要想破坏我们的和平幸福生活的侵略者。”这两句话，给我的印象最深刻。这是多么恳挚而有力的话啊，我将永远记住它！可以想到，爱好和平的祖国人民在我们身上寄托着多么大的希望啊。当时我心里觉得，真像在前方每一次接受上级交给战斗任务时一样地激动，深深感到作为一个志愿军战士是多么光荣，责任多么重大啊！
    接受了这个小女孩的珍贵的礼品和听到她的话以后，我马上郑重地回答她说：“亲爱的小朋友：请你放心！我们坚决要把美国侵略者消灭在朝鲜战场上；我们有把握保卫伟大的祖国人民的安全，保卫祖国小朋友的幸福生活；同时，我们有决心，有信心解除朝鲜人民的痛苦，保卫远东和全世界的和平！”
