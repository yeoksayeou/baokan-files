Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is actively carrying out restoration work in the newly liberated Northwest region, helping the people to improve their lives. Under the instructions of President Ho Chi Minh, many factories have rushed to manufacture agricultural tools and transported them to the newly liberated areas to help farmers with production. A large amount of salt has also been transported to this salt-deficient area to supply the people. In many areas, public land previously occupied by Vietnamese traitors has also been distributed to land-poor farmers, thus greatly increasing farmers' enthusiasm for production.

The people of the Northwest region, liberated from the enslavement of the French aggressors, sincerely thank the People's Government for its care.

Xinhua News Agency: According to Vietnam News Agency, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has promulgated a decision to improve the lives of workers in state-owned factories and civil servants and cadres in government agencies. The government has decided to regularly provide them with winter clothing, mosquito nets, anti-malarial drugs, and free medical treatment, and to give special care to doctors, professors, and engineers. This decision will be implemented from May 1, 1953, International Labor Day.

The "People's" weekly, the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published a commentary pointing out that this concern of the government is of great significance at a time when the Vietnamese people's war of resistance is developing and requiring strong support for the front lines and the army.

    越南政府在新解放地区加紧进行恢复工作
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府在新解放的西北地区积极进行恢复工作，帮助人民改善生活。在胡志明主席的指示下，许多工厂赶造了农具，运到新解放区帮助农民进行生产。大批食盐也运到这个缺盐的地区，供应人民。在许多地区，从前被越奸霸占的公共土地也已分给缺地的农民，因此大大地提高了农民的生产积极性。
    从法国侵略者的奴役下获得解放的西北地区人民，衷心感谢人民政府对他们的关怀。
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府颁布了改善国营工厂工人和政府机关公务人员、干部的生活的决定。政府决定对他们定期发给冬衣、蚊帐、防疟疾药品以及给予公费治疗等，对医生、教授、工程师等并给予特殊的照顾。这个决定从一九五三年五月一日国际劳动节开始实施。
    越南劳动党机关报“人民”周刊发表评论指出：在越南人民的抗战正在向前发展、需要大力支援前方和军队的时候，政府的这种关怀具有重大的意义。
