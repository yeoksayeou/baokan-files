    Opinions on Theater Construction Work
    Letter from reader Li Chang: Last year, I accompanied the Soviet Art Working Group on a performance tour to various places and worked in theaters in sixteen cities including Beijing, Xi'an, Chongqing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Shenyang. I found two issues in theater construction that should be noted.
    Some auditoriums of government agencies and organizations are built in the style of large-scale theaters; however, these venues are mainly used for meetings and reports, and performing arts groups rarely have the opportunity to perform for the masses here. This is a huge waste. The most prominent example is the auditorium of Harbin Agricultural College. This "auditorium" is actually a large theater that can accommodate 2,700 spectators, with a huge stage and dressing rooms that can accommodate hundreds of actors. The auditorium and lounges are also very elaborate. Even the Soviet comrades were surprised by this situation. Therefore, I suggest that in the future, when constructing auditoriums, various agencies should consider the different characteristics of theaters and auditoriums. Although agency auditoriums can also have small stages for meetings and agency entertainment activities, they should never be built as theaters.
    Secondly, some theaters are built very unreasonably. For example, the slope of the audience seating in some theaters is insufficient or other designs are unreasonable, so that audiences in some positions cannot hear or see clearly, or can only see the backs of the audience in front, or their line of sight is parallel to the stage opening, so they can only hear but not see. Some theaters are poorly designed, so that the lights have nowhere to be hidden, and the curtains and scenery are difficult to install. Some theaters have pillars on the stage or the stage is divided into many small rooms, which reduces the performance space... Building theaters is a new topic in our country, and everyone lacks experience. Therefore, learning from advanced Soviet methods, earnestly summarizing experience, and paying special attention to the close cooperation of engineering design and construction personnel and stage art workers is very important.
    Editor's note: Reader Li Chang's letter raises issues that deserve attention. When constructing auditoriums, all units should proceed from actual needs and should not blindly build auditoriums into theaters. Regarding the issue of theater construction, the Ministry of Culture has issued reference blueprints for theater construction, stipulating that the construction blueprints for newly built theaters this year must be submitted to the Ministry of Culture for review; and plans to compile and print a book of "Reference Materials on Theater Design" to be distributed to local cultural departments for reference.

### 对修建剧场工作的意见

专栏：

    对修建剧场工作的意见
    读者李畅来信；去年我伴同苏联艺术工作团到各地旅行演出，在北京、西安、重庆、上海、汉口、沈阳等十六个城市的剧场进行过工作。我发现在剧场建筑方面有两个应该引起注意的问题。
    有些机关、团体的礼堂是按规模巨大的剧场的样式修建的；而这些场所，主要用于开会和做报告，文艺团体很少有机会在这里向群众演出。这是一个巨大的浪费。其中最突出的例子是哈尔滨农学院的礼堂。这个“礼堂”实际上是一个可以容纳观众二千七百人的大剧场，舞台规模巨大，化装室可容纳演员数百人，观众席及休息室也十分讲究。这种情况连苏联同志都感到诧异。因此，我建议今后各地机关修建礼堂时，应考虑到剧场和礼堂的不同特点。机关礼堂虽然也可以有小型舞台，以供开会和机关文娱活动之用；但决不应该把它建成剧场。
    其次，某些剧场修建得很不合理。如有些剧场观众席的坡度不够或其它设计不合理，在有些位置上的观众就听不好、看不清，甚至只能看见前面观众的背，或者视线和台口平行而只能听不能看。有些剧场设计不周，以致灯光无处隐蔽，幕布和布景难以装置。有些剧场舞台上有柱子或舞台被隔成许多小房间，以致缩小了表演的空间……。修建剧场在我国是一个新的课题，大家都缺乏经验。因此，学习苏联先进方法，认真总结经验，并特别注意工程设计施工人员和舞台美术工作者的密切合作，是十分重要的。
    编者按：读者李畅来信所提意见是值得重视的。各单位在建筑礼堂时应该从实际需要出发，不应盲目地把礼堂建成剧场。关于剧场修建问题，中央文化部已发出修建剧场的参考草图，规定今年新建剧场必须将工程蓝图送文化部审查；并拟编印“关于剧场设计参考资料”一书，发给各地文化部门参考。
