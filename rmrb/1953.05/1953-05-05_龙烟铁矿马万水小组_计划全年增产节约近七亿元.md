    Longyan Iron Mine Ma Wanshui Group
    Plans to Increase Production and Save Nearly 700 Million Yuan Throughout the Year

    When the Longyan Iron Mine's national model worker Ma Wanshui group began discussing their plan, some workers felt that iron sandstone, quartzite, and other ore layers had too many different types, were troublesome, and difficult to calculate. With the help of the general factory work group, they realized that the more detailed the calculations, the more precise the plan would be. After half a month of deliberation and discussion, everyone used their brains to find shortcuts and identify key issues for improving the group's efficiency, and formulated the group plan. The state plan required the Ma Wanshui group to excavate 5524.4 cubic meters throughout the year. After group discussion, it was determined that 8532.22 cubic meters could be excavated throughout the year, exceeding the state plan's requirements by more than 50%. The group's costs would be 12.6% lower than the state plan, the state plan could be completed 74 days ahead of schedule, and the group could increase production and save 698,451,000 yuan for the country. To ensure the realization of the plan, the entire group revised various group rules, and all group workers and their families also made personal guarantee conditions.

    龙烟铁矿马万水小组
    计划全年增产节约近七亿元
    龙烟铁矿全国劳动模范马万水小组在开始讨论计划时，有个别的工人认为铁砂岩、石英岩等矿层，样儿多，嫌麻烦，不好计算。经过总厂工作组的帮助，认清了越计算的细致，计划订的越精确。经过半个月的酝酿讨论，大家开动脑筋找窍门，找出了提高小组效率的关键问题，订出了小组计划。国家计划要求马万水小组全年掘进五千五百二十四点四立方公尺，经过小组讨论，全年可掘进八千五百三十二点二二立方公尺，超过国家计划要求的百分之五十以上，小组成本较国家计划降低了百分之十二点六，全年可提前七十四天完成国家计划，还能给国家增产节约六亿九千八百四十五万一千元。全组为了保证计划的实现，又修改了小组的各种制度，全组工人和家属也都订了个人保证条件。
