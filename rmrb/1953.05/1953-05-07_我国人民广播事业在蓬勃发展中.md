China had wireless broadcasting stations more than twenty years ago. At that time, the broadcasting stations were tools used by the reactionary rulers to deceive and numb the people. It was not until 1945, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, that China's people's broadcasting undertaking was pioneered.

In early September 1945, in Yan'an, where the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was located at that time, in a mountain gully outside this small mountain city without electricity and industrial base, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, young people's broadcasting workers overcame various difficulties in material conditions and technical equipment to create China's first broadcasting station - Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station. Soon, Xinhua Broadcasting Stations in Zhangjiakou, Handan, and Harbin also began broadcasting one after another. From the time Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station started broadcasting, the broad masses of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas regarded the liberated areas' broadcasting as a "bright light in the dark night." Because from the liberated areas' broadcasting, they could learn about the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the political, economic, and cultural construction in the liberated areas, as well as all kinds of moving events in people's lives, and they could recognize the road that the Chinese people should take. During the years of the Chinese People's Liberation War from 1946 to 1949, due to changes in the war situation, Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station made three major transfers. For a time, a small earth temple in the mountains of northern Shaanxi was temporarily converted into a broadcasting studio, with the broadcasting microphone placed on the altar. Later, for a long time, the editorial department and broadcasting studio of the broadcasting station were located in two separate places, dozens of miles apart. Often, in order to report important news to the people of the whole country in a timely manner, we had to transmit the news to the announcer word by word by telephone and then broadcast it to the whole country. However, under such difficult circumstances, the people's broadcasting has never been interrupted.

With the great victory of the Chinese revolution, China's people's broadcasting undertaking has developed rapidly. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Article 49 of the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulated "developing the people's broadcasting undertaking." For more than three years, China's people's broadcasting workers, following the decisions and instructions of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, with the strong support of the people of the whole country and the hard work of all people's broadcasting workers, as well as the generous and selfless help of the great ally, the Soviet Union, have been building and developing the people's broadcasting undertaking. In 1948, China had only eight people's broadcasting stations. By the time the Central People's Government was established in 1949, there were 45 people's broadcasting stations in the country. Now there are 60 people's broadcasting stations in the country. Among them, the largest national Central People's Broadcasting Station began broadcasting on the day the Central People's Government was established. In early 1953, the total output power of China's broadcasting stations exceeded 47 percent of that in 1949. Whether in terms of the number of broadcasting stations or output power, the construction of China's people's broadcasting undertaking has now exceeded the highest level in the history of Chinese wireless broadcasting.

In order to make broadcasting effectively serve the broad masses of the people in our country, and in order to enable them to have the opportunity to listen to the radio, the former General Administration of News of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Establishing a Radio Receiving Network" in April 1950. For more than three years, we have initially established a radio receiving organization throughout the country. At present, not only have most counties across the country universally established radio receiving stations, but also some districts and towns in North China and East China have radio receiving stations. As of February this year, there were 20,519 radio receiving stations across the country, with 32,667 full-time and part-time radio receiving staff. In addition, in large and medium-sized cities, there are tens of thousands of street, women, youth, and children's listening groups. The radio receiving network is also developing rapidly in the army. Every combat unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting heroically on the Korean front has been equipped with radios and full-time radio receiving staff. The development of wired broadcasting stations in various parts of the country is also very rapid. At present, 575 county towns and districts and towns across the country have set up wired broadcasting stations, and many factories, mines, and institutions and schools have also established wired broadcasting stations. According to statistics from eight cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai alone, there are 3,489 factory enterprises, institutions, and school broadcasting stations. Every day, listeners all over the country hear domestic and international current affairs reports, new achievements in various aspects of construction, as well as beautiful songs and dramas from the radio through these listening tools.

China's people's broadcasting has gradually entered the lives of the broad masses of the people. It is carrying out large-scale propaganda and mobilization and education work. In the first ten months of last year, the radio receiving staff in 21 provinces went to the countryside to organize 18.32 million farmers to listen to the radio. Radio receiving stations in counties and districts copied and published 1,056 kinds of popular small newspapers, which generally have a circulation of several hundred copies, and some have as many as more than 5,000 copies. In the great political movements such as resisting the United States and aiding Korea, land reform, and the "three-anti" and "five-anti" campaigns, people's broadcasting has played a huge role in propaganda and mobilization. In several cities such as Tianjin, Nanjing, and Wuhan, the number of radio listeners at the most reached more than three-quarters of the city's population. A city like Tianjin with a population of more than two million has organized large-scale radio rallies more than once, with about 1.5 million people listening each time. In 1951, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from the Korean front gave 28 radio speeches at people's broadcasting stations in various places, reporting to the people of the whole country about the heroic killing of the enemy by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front. According to Comrade Chai Chuanruo, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning to China, at least 100 million people listened to their broadcasts across the country. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" last year, when the Soviet famous artist delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble came to China to perform, the organized listeners of the radio performance conferences organized by radio stations across the country reached more than 13 million people. At that time, the radio stations received 70,000 to 80,000 letters from listeners to the Soviet famous artist delegation and the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble; some listeners also sent many valuable gifts to the radio stations, requesting them to be forwarded as gifts. Citizens of Shanghai filled a truck with flowers to the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station to present to Soviet friends. In regular broadcasts, people have also learned a lot of knowledge. More than 69,000 people have participated in listening and learning in the "Russian Language Lectures" held by several broadcasting stations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. The "Political Common Sense Lectures," "Current Affairs Talks," and "Scientific Common Sense Lectures" often held by many people's broadcasting stations are even more popular among the broad masses of the people.

Now, the Tibetan, Mongolian, Korean, and Uyghur people in the border areas of our country can also listen to broadcasts in their own national languages ​​every day. This is not only because the Central People's Broadcasting Station has broadcast programs in Mongolian, Tibetan, Korean, and other national languages, but also because they have their own broadcasting stations. In the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there is the Second Station of the Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station. In the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in the northeastern Korean ethnic area, there is the Yanbian People's Broadcasting Station. The Southwest People's Broadcasting Station and the Qinghai People's Broadcasting Station have also set up Tibetan language broadcasting programs. The Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Station also broadcasts in Uyghur every day. In the areas where these fraternal ethnic groups live, the radio receiving network is also gradually being built.

The Central People's Broadcasting Station's foreign broadcasts are now broadcast to the people of Asia and the Pacific region and the people of the world every day in seven languages ​​including Japanese, English, Korean, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese, and Siamese. In addition, it also broadcasts to overseas Chinese in four dialects of Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Xiamen, and Hakka. Many peace-loving people in many countries listen to the voice of Beijing with great interest every day. The Central People's Broadcasting Station receives many letters from foreign listeners every day, filled with enthusiasm. They said that Beijing's broadcasting has strengthened their confidence in fighting for peace.

With the start of our country's large-scale economic construction, a new situation will also emerge in China's people's broadcasting undertaking. China's people's broadcasting workers will further connect with the masses, connect with reality, and, according to the requirements of the broad masses of listeners, strive to improve the quality of our broadcasting work and overcome the shortcomings in our work within the scope of possible material conditions, so as to meet the needs of China's new economic construction period. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government of China and the Chinese Communist Party, with the warm support of the people of the whole country, and with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, China's people's broadcasting workers are working hard with full confidence to realize the construction plan of our broadcasting undertaking.

    我国人民广播事业在蓬勃发展中
    左荧
    我国在二十多年前就有无线电广播电台了。那时候的广播电台是反动统治者用来欺骗人民和麻醉人民的工具。到一九四五年，在中国共产党的领导下，才开创了我国人民广播事业。
    一九四五年九月初，在当时中国共产党中央所在地延安，这个没有电力供应和工业基础的小山城城外的山沟里，在中国共产党中央直接领导下，年青的人民广播工作者克服了物质条件和技术设备的种种困难，创建了我国人民的第一座广播电台——延安新华广播电台。不久，张家口、邯郸、哈尔滨等新华广播电台也先后开始播音。从延安新华广播电台开始广播那时候起，国民党统治区的广大人民就把解放区的广播看成“黑夜里的明灯”。因为他们从解放区的广播里，可以知道中国共产党的政策和解放区的政治、经济、文化建设情况和人民生活中的种种动人的事情，可以认清中国人民应该走的道路。在一九四六年到一九四九年中国人民解放战争的年月里，由于战争形势的变化，延安新华广播电台曾作了三次大的转移。有一个时期，曾经把陕北山沟里的一间小土地庙临时改作播音室，在神坛上放着播音话筒。后来在很长的一个时期，广播电台编辑部和播音室分设两处，相距几十里路，常常为了及时向全国人民报告重要消息，我们要用电话将消息一个字一个字的传给播音员再向全国广播。但是，在这样困难的情况下，人民的广播从来没有间断过。
    随着中国革命的伟大胜利，我国人民广播事业有了迅速的发展。中华人民共和国成立后，中国人民政治协商会议通过的共同纲领的第四十九条规定了
    “发展人民广播事业”。三年多以来，我国人民广播工作者，遵循着中央人民政府和中国共产党的决定和指示，在全国人民的大力支持和全体人民广播工作者的辛勤努力以及伟大盟邦苏联的慷慨无私的帮助下，建设着和发展着人民广播事业。一九四八年我国只有八座人民广播电台，到一九四九年中央人民政府成立时，全国就有四十五座人民广播电台了。现在全国共有六十座人民广播电台。其中规模最大的全国性的中央人民广播电台，是在中央人民政府成立的那一天开始播音的。一九五三年初，我国各广播电台输出电力的总数超过了一九四九年百分之四十七。不论从电台的数目或输出电力来说，目前我国人民广播事业的建设已经都超过了中国无线电广播历史上的最高水平。
    为了使广播有效地为我国广大人民服务，为了使他们能有收听广播的机会，中央人民政府前新闻总署在一九五○年四月，发布了“关于建立广播收音网的决定”。三年多以来，我们已经在全国范围内初步建立了收音组织。目前，全国不仅绝大部分县已经普遍地设立了收音站，而且在华北区、华东区的一部分区和镇也有收音站了。到今年二月为止，全国各地有收音站两万零五百十九个，专职和兼职的收音员三万二千六百六十七人。另外，在大中城市里，还有几万个街道、妇女、青年、儿童的收听小组。广播收音网在部队里也正普遍地发展着。中国人民解放军和正在朝鲜前线英勇作战的中国人民志愿军的每个战斗单位，都已装设了收音机，配备了专职的收音员。全国各地有线广播站的发展也很快。现在全国有五百七十五个县城和区镇设置了有线广播站，还有很多工厂矿山和机关学校也建立了有线广播站。仅据北京、天津、上海等八个城市统计，就有三千四百八十九个工厂企业机关学校广播站。全国各地的听众，每天就通过这些收听工具从广播中听到国内国际的时事报道，各方面建设的新成就以及优美的歌曲和戏剧。
    我国人民广播，已经逐步地走进广大人民的生活中。它正在进行着巨大规模的宣传鼓动和教育工作。去年头十个月里，二十一个省的收音员就下乡组织了一千八百三十二万农民收听广播。各县、区收音站收抄广播出版的通俗小型报纸有一千零五十六种，一般都发行几百份，有的多到五千多份。在抗美援朝、土地改革和“三反”、“五反”等伟大的政治运动中，人民广播都起了巨大的宣传鼓动作用。天津、南京、武汉等几个城市，广播听众最多的时候曾达到全市人口的四分之三以上。像二百多万人口的天津，曾经不只一次组织了规模巨大的广播大会，每次都大约有一百五十万人收听。一九五一年从朝鲜前线回国的中国人民志愿军代表在各地人民广播电台做了二十八次广播演讲，向全国人民报告中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇杀敌的情况。据中国人民志愿军归国代表柴川若同志谈，全国至少有一亿人收听他们的广播。去年“中苏友好月”期间，苏联著名艺术家代表团和苏军红旗歌舞团来我国表演时，全国各地广播电台组织的广播演奏大会，有组织的听众就有一千三百多万人。当时广播电台收到听众给苏联著名艺术家代表团和苏军红旗歌舞团的信件达七八万件；有些听众并把许多珍贵的礼品送到广播电台，要求代为转赠，上海市民到上海人民广播电台献给苏联朋友的鲜花堆满了一卡车。在经常的广播中，人们还学到了许多知识。北京、上海、重庆等几个广播电台举办的“俄语讲座”，先后有六万九千多人参加收听学习。许多人民广播电台经常举办的“政治常识讲座”、“时事讲话”和“科学常识讲座”更受到广大人们的欢迎。
    现在，我国边疆的藏族、蒙族、朝鲜族和维吾尔族人民，每天还可以收听到他们自己民族语言的广播。这不仅因为中央人民广播电台设有蒙、藏、朝鲜等民族语言的广播节目，而且他们还有自己的广播电台。在内蒙古自治区东部有内蒙古人民广播电台第二台。在东北朝鲜民族聚居区的延边专区，有延边人民广播电台。西南人民广播电台和青海人民广播电台也都设立了藏语广播节目。新疆人民广播电台每天也用维吾尔语广播。在这些兄弟民族居住的地区，收音网也正在逐步建设着。
    中央人民广播电台的对国外广播，现在每天用日语、英语、朝鲜语、越南语、印尼语、缅甸语、暹罗语等七种语言向亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民以及全世界人民广播。另外，还用广州、潮州、厦门、客家四种方言向国外侨胞广播。许多国家爱好和平的人民，每天都用极大的兴趣收听北京的声音。中央人民广播电台每天接到很多国外听众的来信，信里充满了热情。他们说北京的广播增强了他们为和平而奋斗的信心。
    随着我们国家大规模经济建设的开始，我国的人民广播事业也将出现一个崭新的局面。我国人民广播工作者，将进一步联系群众，联系实际，根据广大听众的要求，在物质条件可能的范围内，努力提高我们广播工作的质量，克服我们工作中的缺点，以适应我国新的经济建设时期的需要。在我国中央人民政府、中国共产党的领导下，在全国人民热烈的支持下，在苏联以及其他兄弟国家的帮助下，我国人民广播工作者正满怀信心地为实现我们广播事业的建设计划而努力工作着。
