    Writing Great Articles
    ——A Record of Learning and Life in the Evergreen Writing Teaching Method Experimental Class
    Zhang Ming
    I
    The Political Department of the North China Military Region has established a writing teaching method experimental class. This experimental class, Writing Great Articles: A Record of Learning and Life in the Evergreen Writing Teaching Method Experimental Class, Zhang Ming, I, has a total of fifty-three students. Although everyone didn't know each other before, they started talking like brothers as soon as they met. The basic content of the conversation was: writing articles is difficult.
    A soldier named Zheng Wenhai, who joined the army in 1950, was extremely happy when rapid literacy learning began. In just a few days, he crammed in over a thousand characters. He thought that he could get rid of his illiteracy; however, he didn't expect to encounter difficulties in writing articles. When he heard that Changqing had created a new writing teaching method, his excitement was beyond words. But he was a little skeptical. After arriving at the experimental class, he heard that a comrade named Gao Mintai knew about the writing teaching method, so he asked Gao Mintai:
    "Comrade Gao Mintai, what exactly is the writing teaching method about?" Gao Mintai was an orderly in the Political Department of the Military Region. He had heard about this matter from the assistant. Seeing someone asking him, he said, "I don't know the details either, but I heard that if people who know more than a thousand characters and have some reading ability learn to write according to his method, they can smoothly write articles of thousands of words. Our assistant couldn't write articles in the past, but since listening to the writing teaching method, he can also write articles of thousands of words."
    However, no matter what, everyone was always a little suspicious. Some said, "Rapid literacy is possible because there are crutches; what does rapid writing rely on?" "Writing articles is all about daily grinding and practicing, it's honed through practice, how can there be rapid success!" While everyone was chatting casually, they suddenly heard someone say, "Changqing, Changqing, I don't ask for your teaching method to be 100% guaranteed, just 70% or 80% will do; I don't hope to be able to write thousands of words at once, just make writing articles not difficult." Everyone saw that it was Shi Jinyou, a deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, lying on the bed talking to himself. Seeing his expression, everyone couldn't help but laugh. Hearing the laughter, he turned around and said seriously, "What are you laughing at! I'm telling the truth."
    II
    The classroom of the experimental class was covered with many red and green slogans. Some of the slogans were written like this:
    "The words of workers, peasants, and soldiers are on stage, writing great articles."
    "I write about myself, there is a lot of content; to write well, write one thing at a time."
    "Speaking out is really good, it's like writing a draft; two people speak to each other once, and it is written completely and thoughtfully."
    Everyone started guessing when they saw these slogans. Gao Mintai said, "Don't even talk about getting on stage, I can't even write sitting down!" Some said, "I've only heard of composition, but I've never heard of 'speaking writing'. How can articles be spoken out!" Some said, "How can 'I write about myself' be written!" Everyone felt that these slogans were both new and strange, and they started clamoring.
    Before long, Changqing arrived. Everyone stared at him intently, as if trying to find a secret from him. After Changqing gave a mobilization speech, he briefly explained the important steps of the writing teaching method. "Speaking writing" began. But some people thought that speaking writing didn't solve the problem and were unwilling to speak. After explanation, their thinking was straightened out. Classrooms, dormitories, and corridors were all filled with speaking writing groups, speaking very lively.
    While everyone was speaking lively, someone suddenly started crying, and more and more people were crying. Zheng Wenhai cried the most sadly. Zheng Wenhai said, "My father carried long-term work for the landlord. My mother did odd jobs for the landlord. Regardless of whether it was sunny or windy and rainy, I had to herd pigs for the landlord; the landlord wouldn't even let me eat enough. One day, the landlord said that I had made the pigs thin, so he beat me with a stick and wouldn't let me eat. I couldn't bear the hunger, so I secretly ate a bowl of pig feed, and the landlord happened to see it; the landlord beat me severely and wouldn't let me herd pigs for him anymore. I had to go home. There was nothing to eat at home either, and my mother was sick. So I and my little sister went to the hill to dig wild vegetables. After digging for a while, my sister's broken basket was still empty. I thought she didn't know how to find them, so I went to help her find them. Who knew that as soon as I walked up to her, she was stuffing the dug-out wild vegetables into her mouth. It turned out that she had eaten all the vegetables she had dug. At that time, I was so angry that I slapped her and said, 'Eat! Eat! Don't you feel sorry that mother is sick and lying at home without food!' My sister cried, and I cried too. I thought: My sister is so young, what does she know? If it were a rich family's child, they would still have a nanny to coax him to play! ... The more I thought about it, the more sad I became, and I couldn't help but want to cry. But thinking that my mother was still waiting for food, I wiped away my tears and coaxed my little sister to continue digging vegetables. Thinking back to those difficult days, how could I not cry!"
    Originally, Teacher Chang wanted everyone to write about the most painful, happiest, and most unforgettable things, but everyone started with the bitter things first.
    Many people cried so hard that they couldn't lift their heads. "Speaking writing" really became a grievance meeting. Later, Changqing said, "We must turn hatred and tears into strength, let it congeal onto the paper with the ink. Write your sadness, your difficulties, your anger, and resistance completely onto the paper, this is our victory."
    After "speaking writing", everyone silently sat down at their seats and started writing articles. When Zheng Wenhai started writing, his heart was beating fast. Before the pen even moved, he had already said a few words. Later, he said that he was very excited at the time. He thought: What's going on? In the past, the ink on the pen had dried up, and he still couldn't write a single word. Teacher Chang's method is really good! Everyone was writing non-stop, only Shi Jinyou hadn't started writing yet. Changqing asked him what was wrong, and he said, "I don't know how to write a word." Changqing said, "Skip it." He said uneasily, "I'm afraid I'll forget it." Changqing said, "It doesn't matter, I'll fill it in for you if you forget." Then he patiently explained to him again. Strangely enough, as soon as Teacher Chang had walked two circles in the classroom, he saw that Shi Jinyou had already written two pages. In less than three hours, Gao Mintai handed in his paper, titled "Half a Bag of Corn Cobs", writing more than a thousand words. Zheng Wenhai wrote more than two thousand eight hundred words, and wanted to continue writing, but Teacher Chang said, "Take a break!" But he said, "The more I write, the more I want to write, I can't stop!" The teacher picked up his homework and saw that it was written smoothly and fluently. He wrote about how he herded pigs for the landlord and how the landlord oppressed him. The teacher said, "You wrote very well! You can end it here, hand it in!" Zheng Wenhai hurriedly wrote a neat line of small characters on his assignment book: "My First Suffering" (title); at the end, he wrote the words "To be continued", and then handed the book to Teacher Chang. And said: "I still have the second suffering - suffering the landlord's anger; the third time fighting the landlord; then I will write: when I became a militia member, cleverly fighting the Japanese devils, I signed up to join the army ... I have a lot of things to write about!"
    After the "speaking writing" stage, not only did everyone write articles as smoothly as a horse running on the plains, but also the subject matter of writing increased. Many students listed many topics, preparing to write them one by one.
    III
    The students finished writing their first article, and they were both happy and worried. They were happy that, as Changqing said, they wrote great articles effortlessly; they were worried about whether this counted as an article? Would the teacher pick up a red pen and draw many "through-heart bars" and "traffic networks"? Or would he write many comments at the end of the article such as "repetitive and verbose, not grasping the center"? After everyone wrote their articles, that night, they all crowded into Changqing's and the two assistant teachers' rooms, asking whether their articles were good or bad. Zheng Wenhai held Changqing's hand and said, "Teacher Chang, I have never written an article before! Does what I wrote count as an article?" Shi Jinyou said, "Teacher Chang, you are a judge, I am waiting for your judgment!" This made the comrades laugh.
    The next day was "homework commentary". Changqing read fifteen assignments in a row, and the comrades were moved by these articles that were full of love and hate and were exceptionally vivid. When talking about the places that made people sad, Changqing couldn't help but shed tears. Finally, Changqing said, "Today we have won a great victory; only a few of the fifty-three comrades got a score of four, and the rest all got a score of five. We must continue to work hard and achieve greater results."
    The comrades never thought that they would get such great encouragement from the teacher. After class, everyone happily watched each other's homework and exchanged experiences. Only Shi Jinyou sat in his seat, staring at his assignment book in a daze. He flipped through it again and again. This assignment was a full five large sheets, more than one thousand eight hundred words. The comment was: "You wrote it in your own words, wrote about very touching things, the writing is also very smooth, not many holes to fill, hope to continue to work hard!" Above the comment was a red "five". "Did I write this myself?" He was a little unbelievable. Because for him, this thing seemed too sudden. After he was promoted from the rapid literacy class to the elementary class, he began to learn to write articles. When he was reading a lot, he felt that the things in the books were also very simple, and there would be no difficulty in writing them. But after the teacher explained, what with themes, topics, levels, paragraphs, ideology, typical things, etc., he was confused, and felt that writing articles was the business of intellectuals, and "roughnecks" just couldn't do it. One Sunday, he decided to write an article. However, he sat for a whole day, started eight times, but still couldn't write it. He was disappointed! He was impatient, but he had never been so angry. That day, he tore a brand new study book to pieces, and almost broke the newly bought fountain pen. He finally managed to write an article of several hundred words, but the teacher kept saying things that made people sad: "What are you writing! It's like dogs fighting, a mess, no one can understand!" From then on, whenever he heard that it was composition class, he would become nervous, and break out in a sweat.
    But now, Shi Jinyou could write articles effortlessly. In the past, it was difficult to write an article even in a day, but now he could write six or seven hundred words as soon as he picked up the pen; in the past, he was used to being friends with twos and threes, but now fives also came to visit; in the past, the teacher couldn't read the articles he wrote, and he couldn't read them himself, but now the articles he wrote, the teacher read them loud and clear, like reading articles from a book. The most unforgettable thing for him was: his article moved Teacher Chang to tears. He said: If the article is not well written, can the teacher cry?
    IV
    The "I write about myself" teaching activity ended, and Changqing put forward a new topic: "Turning outwards". As for what "turning outwards" meant and how to turn, Changqing didn't explain it to everyone in detail. Although everyone believed that Teacher Chang had a way, how exactly to "turn"? This was still a mystery in the comrades' hearts. In this way, everyone entered the learning stage of "turning outwards".
    What exactly is "turning outwards"? Changqing pointed to the newly replaced slogans on the wall and said, "Have the comrades seen these slogans? 'Turning outwards' means from 'I write about myself' to 'writing about comrades'; to 'writing about the army', 'writing about the country', 'writing about Beijing', 'writing about Korea', 'writing about Moscow'. Comrades, think about what exactly you are writing?" Changqing didn't let everyone answer, and then took out the typical examples he had cultivated in advance and said:
    "I'll read the comrades' essay titles first, please comment on them and see if they have turned outwards or not." He read: "I Met the Eighth Route Army", "My Good Squad Leader", "I Came to Beijing"; also: "Digging the Chaobai River", "My Dear Instructor"... Changqing read more than twenty such essay titles in a row. He asked:
    "Comrades, has it turned outwards or not?" The comrades answered in unison: "It has turned outwards!" Changqing said: "Not only has it turned outwards, but it has turned out very well. Shi Jinyou's 'I Met the Eighth Route Army' vividly narrates his story of joining the revolution; Gao Mintai's 'My Good Squad Leader' narrates the good squad leader's care and love after he joined the army; some wrote 'I Came to Beijing', saying that he had heard of Beijing when he was very young, saying that only high-ranking officials could enter Beijing, and poor boys had no share, but now he didn't expect to come to Beijing too. ... These articles all show that the comrades' observation ability and thinking ability have been greatly improved, the writing field has also been widened, the writing style has also increased, and the articles have become more vivid." Especially this last paragraph, Changqing said very clearly and powerfully, he wanted everyone to imprint every word in their minds.
    After class, Zheng Wenhai shouted loudly: "Hey! I thought 'turning outwards' was a very arduous battle, who knew that without firing a single shot, it had already turned outwards!"
    After "turning outwards", the comrades also learned "lining up" and "exemplifying writing". Writing articles not only became more effortless, but the articles also became clear and beautiful, making them lovable. At this time, the comrades had an inextricable relationship with writing articles. Originally, it was required to write one article in a teaching stage, but some comrades wrote two articles in one day. Everyone asked each other as soon as they met: "What are you writing?" Everyone was buried in writing! Writing! It's really that what the eyes see, what the ears hear, what the heart thinks, everything is an article. At this time, Changqing told everyone again: "Be mindful everywhere, and everything is an article." Writing articles became a craze.
    One night, Changqing finished reading the homework, it was already one o'clock in the morning. At this time, he saw that the lights in the students' dormitory were still on, so he walked in and saw that some were writing articles by candlelight.
    "Aren't you asleep yet? It's already very late!"
    "Oh! Teacher Chang." They raised their heads and said: "Isn't it not yet ten o'clock?"
    "Hey! What kind of watch are you using, it's already past one o'clock."
    "Why is it so fast, I thought the lights out call had just been blown!" Zheng Wenhai said in surprise.
    "Go to sleep, you still have to go to class tomorrow, don't exhaust your body." Changqing kindly urged everyone, but he also walked towards the comrades. His eyes had already fallen on the comrades' assignment books.
    Zhang Chengxi wrote "Deputy Director Zhang Abides by Classroom Discipline", recounting the story of Zhang Zhixiang, deputy director of the Military Region Political Department, visiting the experimental class yesterday afternoon. This article not only highlights the center, but also writes very delicately and vividly in some places. Li Wanhe wrote "The Stinky Pit Became a People's Swimming Pool", which was also well written. Judging from these articles, the comrades' observation ability and thinking ability have truly improved.
    After Changqing finished reading the homework, he said: "Isn't this already finished?" Zheng Wenhai said with a smile: "This is already the second article." Saying that, he handed the finished article to Changqing. Changqing didn't rush to read it, his eyes quietly fell on the faces of the comrades. It seemed to say: You are really great! Zheng Wenhai was embarrassed by Changqing's gaze and said: "Teacher Chang, I really don't know what's going on. In the past, the teacher said that I was a wooden bump, stupid and clumsy; whenever I mentioned composition, I would panic and my hands would tremble. But now it's changed, my mind is also clear, and writing articles is not only not difficult, but I love writing more and more." Gao Mintai said: "The difficult look in the past has disappeared without a trace."
    Changqing looked at their smiling faces and had many thoughts in his heart. He saw: The wisdom of workers, peasants, and soldiers is infinite, it is like a pearl in the sand. Once it is discovered, it will emit a dazzling light. These comrades from worker-peasant backgrounds are so smart and creative!
    V
    There were still ten minutes before class, and the comrades were crowded together for some reason. Gao Mintai was anxious outside and couldn't squeeze in. At this time, Changqing arrived, and Gao Mintai hurriedly shouted: "Teacher Chang!"
    When everyone heard that Teacher Chang was here, they dispersed all at once. Everyone said in a hubbub: "Teacher Chang, Zheng Wenhai's article has been reported!" Changqing looked at everyone and said: "The comrades' articles are very well written, and many teachers were moved to tears after reading them; after reading this one, they wanted to read that one. Comrade Zheng Wenhai's article is just one of them. In the future, the comrades' articles will continue to be published in the newspaper, and some good articles will also be compiled into the 'Worker-Peasant-Soldier Anthology'!"
    Everyone was listening to Teacher Chang's speech, but Gao Mintai had already circled the newspaper in his arms, reading it again and again, and then turned to look at Zheng Wenhai and said in a low voice: "Zheng Wenhai, not simple!"
    When Zheng Wenhai heard that his article was in the newspaper, his heart had already been pounding, and his face turned red when he heard the comrades' praise. He knew that the comrades' articles were not badly written either, so he repeated Teacher Chang's words to Gao Mintai: "Won't your articles be reported in the future as well!"
    While Gao Mintai was reading the newspaper, he also paid attention to Teacher Chang's speech. Suddenly, he discovered a problem in Zheng Wenhai's article. He asked Changqing: "Teacher Chang, there are many small circles in this article, with 'one', 'two'... written inside. What does this mean?" Teacher Chang said: "This is a notation mark. This article is very touching, but there are also some small problems. The annotated places indicate that these sentences need to be reorganized. The content of our class today is 'organizing sentences'." Changqing paused and continued: "The comrades have made many suggestions to me, saying that I always say that the comrades' articles are well written, but I don't mention the shortcomings. I think, it should be affirmed that the articles are well written, and as for the shortcomings, we must also correct them. If the shortcomings are not big, we must overcome them when they are pointed out. We will start 'organizing sentences' in this class, first organizing the repetitive and verbose ones, and then organizing the inappropriate words and incomplete meanings; one by one, we must organize our articles more beautifully and concisely."
    VI
    The comrades learned to write articles and letters, and also learned to write reports and summaries. Because everyone learns culture and writes articles not for anything else, but to do a good job in revolutionary work.
    After everyone learned to write letters, it seemed that everyone had discussed it in advance. Many people's first letters were written to Chairman Mao, reporting their learning achievements to Chairman Mao. When Changqing announced this matter, how happy everyone should be!
    The comrades repeatedly instructed Comrade Changqing to forward the letters they wrote to Chairman Mao. At this time, a comrade said: "There are so many of us, and everyone has to write a letter, which is a waste of Chairman Mao's time. Let's put everyone's wishes together and write a letter in general!" This suggestion was unanimously praised by everyone.
    At this point, Changqing said to everyone: "Our experimental class has been open for a month, and everyone's learning achievements are very good, and they have successfully completed the tasks assigned by the superiors. We have not only written great articles, but also developed good reading habits and writing habits, and learned to 'organize sentences', which is our powerful guarantee for improving ourselves in the future. But we cannot be complacent, because at present, compared with the requirements of the superiors, our learning achievements have good aspects, and there are also shortcomings, such as the vocabulary is not rich enough, there are still problems in the sentences, and the reading ability is not high enough. We must overcome these shortcomings in the future. Under the education of Chairman Mao, we will definitely complete our learning tasks satisfactorily."
    When Changqing said the last sentence, the students all beamed, as if saying: "With Chairman Mao, and with such a good cultural teacher educated by Chairman Mao, learning culture, writing articles, and learning science is no problem!"

    大篇文章写出来
    ——常青写作教学法实验班学习生活散记
    张铭
    一
    华北军区政治部成立了写作教学法实验班。这个大篇文章写出来
    ——常青写作教学法实验班学习生活散记张    铭一实验班，共有五十三个学员。虽然大家过去互不相识，可是一见面，就像亲兄弟一样地谈开了。谈话的基本内容是：写文章难。
    一个叫郑文海的，是一九五零年参军的战士，速成识字学习开始后，他高兴极了，几天工夫，突击了一千多字，他想，这下子文盲帽子可以摘掉了；可是，没想到写文章又遇到了困难。他听说常青又创造了新的写作教学法，那高兴劲就不用提了。但他又有点不相信。来到实验班后，听说有一个叫高敏太的同志知道写作教学法的情况，他便问高敏太：
    “高敏太同志，写作教学法究竟是怎么回事？”高敏太是军区政治部的勤务员，他曾经从协理员那里听说这件事。他见有人问他，就说：“我知道得也不详细，只听说，会写一千多个字的人，又有些阅读能力的，要照他这个方法学写作，就能顺顺当当写出上千字的文章来。我们协理员过去也不会写文章，自从听了写作教学法，也能写出上千字的文章来了。”
    不过，不管怎么说，大家总是有点怀疑。有的说：“识字能速成，是因为有拐棍；写作速成，它靠什么呢？”“写文章都是日日磨，天天练，磨练出来的，那有速成的呢！”大家正在漫谈，忽然听见人说：“常青，常青，我不要求你的教学法有百分之百的把握，有个七、八成就行了；也不希望一下能写几千字，写文章不作难就行。”大家一看是师金友，某部的一个副排长，正躺在床上自言自语呢。大家看了他那神情，禁不住都笑了起来。他听见笑声，转过身来，正经地说：“笑什么！我说的都是实话。”
    二实验班的课堂里贴着许多红红绿绿的标语，有几张标语是这样写的：
    “工农兵的话上了台，大篇文章写出来。”
    “我写我，内容多；为了写得好，一次写一个。”
    “说文实在好，等于打草稿；二人相对说一遍，写得圆满又周到。”
    大家看了这些标语，都猜想开了：高敏太说：“不要说到台子上啦，坐在下面写，我也写不出来呀！”有的说：“我只听说过作文，可没听说过‘说文’，文章那有说出来的呀！”有的说：“‘我写我’可怎样写呀！”大家感到这些标语又新鲜又奇怪，就七言八语地嚷开啦。
    不一会，常青来了。大家都聚精会神地望着他，好像要从他身上望出一个秘密。常青进行了动员以后，简单地说了一下写作教学法的几个重要步骤。“说文”开始了。但有些人认为说文不解决问题，不愿意说。经过解释，思想也就搞通了。教室里，寝室里，走廊上，到处都是说文小组，说得非常热闹。
    正说得热闹，忽然有人呜呜地哭起来了，而且，哭的人越来越多。郑文海哭得最伤心。郑文海说：“我父亲给地主扛长活。我娘给地主作零活。我不分天晴还是刮风下雨，都要给地主放猪；地主还不让吃饱饭。有一天，地主说我把猪放瘦了，他就拿棍子打我，还不让吃饭。我饿得受不住了，偷吃了一碗猪食，恰巧又被地主看见了；地主把我狠狠地打了
    一顿，再也不让我给他放猪了。我只好回家。家里也是没有啥吃的，娘还有病。我就和小妹妹到山岗子上去挖野菜。挖了一阵子，妹妹的破篮子里还是空空的。我想是她不会找，我就去帮她找。谁知我刚走到她跟前，她正把挖出来的野菜往嘴里塞，原来她挖的菜，自己都吃了。当时我气得不行，就打了她一巴掌，说：‘吃！吃！你就不心痛娘有病，娘躺在家里还没吃饭呢！’妹妹哭起来了，我也哭起来了。我想到：妹妹年纪这么小，懂得什么呢？要是富家的孩子，还得褓姆哄他玩呢！……我越想越难过，恨不得痛哭一场。可是想到妈妈还等着吃饭，就擦擦眼泪哄着小妹妹继续挖菜。回想到这些难过的日子，怎不叫我痛哭呢！”
    本来常教员要大家写最痛苦、最快乐、最难忘的事，但大家都先从苦事开始了。
    很多人哭得抬不起头来，“说文”真变成诉苦会了。后来常青说：“我们要把仇恨和眼泪都变成力量，让它随着墨汁凝结到纸上去。把自己的伤心，把自己的难过，把自己的忿恨和反抗，完完全全地写到纸上去，这就是我们的胜利。”
    “说文”之后，大家都鸦雀无声地坐到自己的座位上，写起文章来了。郑文海开始写时，心里直跳，笔还没动，话已经说出来几句了。后来他说，当时他是很激动的，他想：这是怎么回事？以前笔头上的墨水都等干了，还写不出一句话，常教员的方法真好啊！大家都唰唰不停地写着，这时只有师金友还没动笔。常青问他是怎么回事，他说：“有个字不会写。”常青说：“跳过去呀。”他不安地说：“怕忘了。”常青说：“没关系，忘了我给你填。”接着又耐心地向他作了一番解释。说也奇怪，常教员刚在教室里转了两个圈，再看师金友时，他已写成两页了。不到三个钟头，高敏太交卷了，题目是
    “半布袋玉茭棒子”，写了一千多字。郑文海写了两千八百多字，还要写，常教员说：“歇歇吧！”他却说：“越写越想写，煞不住尾了！”教员拿起他的作业来一看，写得又通顺又流畅。把他怎样给地主放猪，地主怎样压迫他，全写上了。教员说：“你写得好极啦！你这就可以结尾啦，交了吧！”郑文海急忙在作文本上工工整整地写了一行小字：“我第一次受苦”（题目）；在末尾又写了“绪（续）写”二字，然后便把本子交给了常教员。并说：“我还有第二次受苦——受地主的气；第三次斗地主；再写就是：当了民兵、巧计打鬼子、我报名参军……我要写的事可多啦！”
    同志们经过了“说文”阶段，不但写文章像平原跑马一样顺当，同时写作的题材也多了，不少学员列出了许多题目，准备一个一个写下去。
    三学员们写完了第一篇文章，又高兴、又担心。高兴的是，真是如常青所说，毫不费力地写出了大篇文章；担心的是，这算不算文章呢？教员会不会拿起红笔划许多“穿心槓子”和“交通网”呢？或者在文章的末尾批上“重复啰嗦，没有抓住中心”等许多批语呢？大家写好文章以后，当天晚上，都挤在常青和两位辅导教员的屋子里，打听自己写的文章是好是坏。郑文海握着常青的手说：“常教员，我一次文章也没写过呀！我这写的算不算文章？”师金友说：“常教员，你就是一个法官，我就等着你这一判啦！”说得同志们都笑起来了。
    第二天是“讲评作业”。常青一连气讲读了十五本作业，同志们都被这爱憎分明、异常生动的文章所感动了。讲到使人难过的地方，常青也抑止不住地流出了眼泪。最后常青说：“今天我们出师打了一个大胜仗；五十三个同志只有几个人是四分，其余全是五分。我们要继续努力，取得更大的成绩。”
    同志们从没有想到会得到教员这样大的鼓励。下课之后，大家都非常高兴地互相观看作业和交流经验，唯有师金友坐在自己的座位上，看着自己的作业本子出神。他翻了一遍又一遍，这作业足足五大张，一千八百多字。批语是：“你是用自己的话写的，写出了很动人的事情，文字也很通顺，补的窟窿不多，望继续努力！”批语的上面是一个红“五”字。“这是自己写的吗？”他有点不大相信。因为对他来说，这事情好像是太突然了。他从速成识字班升入初小班以后，就开始学写文章。他在大量阅读时就觉得书上的那些事也挺简单，写起来不会有什么困难。可是经教员一讲，什么主题、题材、层次、段落、思想性、典型事物等等，把他讲得迷迷糊糊的，感到写文章是知识分子的事，“大老粗”就是不行。有一个星期日，他下决心要写出一篇文章。可是，他整整坐了一天，起了八次头，还是没有写成。他失望了！他的性情急躁，可也从没发过那样大的火，那天他把一个崭新的学习本撕了个光，把新买的钢笔也几乎摔坏了。好容易写了一篇几百字的文章，教员又尽说些使人伤心的话：“你们写的是什么文章呀！像狗打架一样，乱七八糟，谁也看不懂！”自此以后，他一听说上作文课，心里就紧张起来，一头一头地冒大汗。
    可是，现在师金友竟能毫不费力地写出文章来了。以前写一天也难写出一篇，现在提笔就能写六、七百字；以前照例是和二分三分交朋友，现在五分也登门拜访了；以前写的文章，不要说教员念不通，自己也念不通，现在写出的文章，教员一念堂堂响，和念书上的文章一样。最使他难于忘记的是：他的文章，把常教员都感动得哭了。他说：要是文章写得不好，教员能哭吗？四
    “我写我”的教学活动结束了，常青又提出一个新鲜的题目：“向外转”。至于什么叫“向外转”，怎样转，常青并没有向大家详细说。虽然大家都相信常教员是有办法的，但究竟怎样“转”？这在同志们的心里还是个谜。就这样，大家进入了“向外转”的学习阶段。
    究竟什么叫“向外转”呢？常青指着墙上新换的标语说：“同志们都看过这些标语吗？‘向外转’就是从‘我写我’到‘写同志’；到‘写部队’、‘写国家’、‘写北京’、‘写朝鲜’、‘写莫斯科’。同志们想一下，你们究竟写的是什么呢？”常青没有让大家回答，紧接着拿出事先培养的典型说：
    “我先把同志们的作文题念一下，请你们评一评，看是转出去了还是没转出去。”他念道：“我遇到了八路军”、“我的好班长”、“我来到北京”；还有：“挖潮白河”、“我亲爱的指导员”……。常青一连念了二十几个这样的作文题。他问道：
    “同志们，转出去没有？”同志们异口同声地回答说：“转出去啦！”常青说：“不仅转出去了，而且转得很好。师金友写的‘我遇到了八路军’，生动地叙述了他参加革命的故事；高敏太的‘我的好班长’，叙述他参军后，好班长的体贴爱护；有的写‘我来到北京’，说他很小的时候就听说过北京，说北京只有作大官的人才能进，穷小子是没有份的，现在想不到他也到北京了。……这些文章都说明同志们的观察能力和思考能力大大地提高了，写作领域也宽广了，文章的体裁也多了，文章也更生动了。”特别是后面这一段话，常青说得非常明确有力，他想让大家把每个字都印到脑子里去。
    下课后，郑文海大声嚷道：“嗨！我以为‘向外转’是一场很艰巨的战斗呢，谁知没动一枪一刀，已经转出去啦！”
    “向外转”之后，同志们又学会了“排队”和“举例作文”。写起文章来不但更加省力，文章也眉清目秀，令人爱看了。这时，同志们都和写文章发生了难解之缘。原来要求一个教学阶段写一篇，可是有的同志一天就写两篇。大家一见面就互相问道：“你写什么？”一个一个都是埋着头写啊！写啊！真是眼睛看的，耳朵听的，心里想的，到处都是文章。这时常青又告诉大家：“到处留心皆文章”。写文章便成了热潮。
    一天晚上，常青看完了作业，已经是午夜一点了。这时他看到学员寝室里还有灯亮，他走进去一看，有的正在蜡烛光下写文章。
    “你们还没有睡？天已经很晚啦！”
    “哦！常教员。”他们抬起头来说：“还不到十点吧？”
    “嗨！你们用的什么表，已经下一点了。”
    “怎么这样快，我还以为才吹罢熄灯号呢！”郑文海惊奇地说。
    “睡吧，明天还得上课呢，不要把身体累坏了。”常青亲切地催促着大家，但他一面又向同志们面前走来。视线早已落在同志们的作文本上。
    张成喜写的是“张副主任遵守课堂纪律”，记述昨天下午军区政治部张致祥副主任到实验班参观的事情。这篇文章不但中心突出，有些地方还写得非常细腻、生动。李万和写的是“臭水坑变成了人民游泳池”，写得也不错。从这些文章看，同志们的观察能力和思考能力是真正提高了。
    常青看完了作业说：“这不是已经写完了吗？”郑文海笑着说：“这已经是第二篇了。”说着把写成了的一篇递给了常青。常青并没有急着去看它，两眼静静地落在同志们的脸上。好像说：你们真行啊！郑文海被常青看得很不好意思，说：“常教员，我真不知道是怎么回事，以前教员说我是一个榆木疙瘩，笨头笨脑；一提起作文心里就发慌，手也打颤。可是现在却变了，脑筋也透亮了，写起文章来不但不犯难，反而越写越爱写了。”高敏太说：“从前那种作难的样子，现在都跑得没踪没影了。”
    常青看着他们微笑着的脸，心里有很多感想。他看到：工农兵的智慧是无穷无尽的，它就像沙里明珠一样，当它一旦被发掘出来，就会放射出耀眼的光芒。这些工农出身的同志们，是多么聪明而富有创造性啊！五
    离上课还有十分钟，不知为了什么同志们挤成一团。高敏太站在外边干着急也挤不进去。这时，常青来了，高敏太急忙喊道：“常教员！”
    大家一听常教员来了，一下子就散开了。大家七嘴八舌地说：“常教员，郑文海的文章上报啦！”常青看了看大家说：“同志们的文章写得很好，好多教员看了都被感动得流泪；看了这篇还想看那篇。郑文海同志的这篇文章只是其中的一篇。以后报上还要继续发表同志们的文章，有些好文章还要编到‘工农兵文选’里去呢！”
    大家都在听常教员讲话，高敏太却早把报纸圈在自己的怀里了，看了一遍又一遍，然后转身望着郑文海小声地说：“郑文海，不简单啦！”
    郑文海一听说他的文章上了报，心里早扑通扑通地跳起来了，听到同志们的夸奖，脸也红了。他知道同志们的文章写得也不坏，他就把常教员的一句话照样对高敏太说了一遍：“你们的文章将来还不是一样要上报！”
    高敏太一边看报，一边也注意听常教员讲话。忽然他从郑文海的文章里发现了问题。他问常青说：“常教员，这篇文章里有许多小圈圈，小圈圈里边写着‘一’、‘二’……这是什么意思？”常教员说：“这是注解号。这篇文章很动人，但也有一些小毛病，有注解的地方就表示这些句子还得整理。我们今天上课的内容就是‘整理语句’。”常青停了一下继续说：“同志们很多次向我提意见，说我尽说同志们的文章写得好，就是不提缺点。我想，文章写得好，这是应当肯定的，至于缺点，我们也得纠正。缺点不大，提出来我们就要克服掉。这一堂我们开始‘整理语句’，先整理重复啰嗦的，然后整理用词不当、语意不完整的；一个一个接着来，一定要把我们的文章整理得更美，更精练。”六
    同志们学会了写文章、写信，同时还学会了写报告，写总结。因为大家学文化、写文章不是为了别的，而是为了做好革命工作。
    大家学会了写信以后，好像都在事先商量过了一样，不少人第一封信都是写给毛主席的，向毛主席报告自己的学习成绩。当常青宣布了这件事情以后，大家该是多么高兴啊！
    同志们一再嘱咐常青同志，一定要把他们写的信转给毛主席。这时有一个同志说：“咱们这么多的人，人人要写一封信，太浪费毛主席的时间了。把大家的心意合在一块，总起来写一封信吧！”这个意见得到大家一致的赞许。
    到这里，常青向大家说：“咱们实验班开学已经一个月了，大家的学习成绩都很好，都圆满地完成了上级交给的任务。我们不但写出了大篇文章，并且养成了良好的阅读习惯和写作习惯，学会了‘整理语句’，这就是我们今后提高自己的有力保证。不过我们还不能自满，因为在目前来说，我们的学习成绩和上级的要求相比较，有好的一方面，也有不足的地方，比如字、词汇还不够丰富，语句上还有毛病，阅读能力还不够高。这些缺点，我们今后一定要克服它。在毛主席的教育下，我们一定会圆满地完成我们的学习任务的。”
    常青说到最后一句的时候，学员们一个个都眉飞色舞地，好像在说：“有毛主席，有毛主席教养下的这样好的文化教员，学文化、写文章，学科学，不成问题！”
