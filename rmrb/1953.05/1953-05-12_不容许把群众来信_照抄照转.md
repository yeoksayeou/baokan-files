Reader Luo Naiwen writes: Comrade Tian Xuzhao of the Central South Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School wrote a letter to the Central South People's Supervisory Committee last winter, reporting the bureaucratic and criticism-suppressing errors of the leaders of the Workers' and Staff School affiliated with the Central South Geological Bureau. However, the staff member of the Central South People's Supervisory Committee who handled this letter did not even clearly see who was being reported, and simply "copied and forwarded" it, resulting in the letter being forwarded to the wrong place. It took forty-seven days for the letter to reach the Central South Geological Bureau. Furthermore, due to the Central South Geological Bureau's lack of attention to people's letters, it was delayed and suppressed for another three months without being thoroughly dealt with.

Tian Xuzhao was originally a staff member of the Workers' and Staff School of the Central South Geological Bureau and also served as a people's supervision correspondent. Last winter, he was transferred to study at the Central South Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School. After arriving at the Workers' and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, he wrote a report to the Central South People's Supervisory Committee regarding some problems he knew about the suppression of democracy by Huang Tao and others, secretaries of the Workers' and Staff School of the Central South Geological Bureau. Originally, the words "Workers' and Staff School" were clearly written in the materials and cover letter written by Tian Xuzhao, and the content of the materials also showed that the person being reported was not from the Workers' and Peasants Secondary School. However, the comrade of the Central South People's Supervisory Committee who first handled this material, based only on the fact that the return address of the letter was "Workers' and Peasants Secondary School," filled in the handling slip with "Reflects that the leaders of the Workers' and Peasants Secondary School suppressed democracy and took retaliatory measures, and the masses dare not raise opinions about Secretary Huang." The director then routinely instructed: "Call to inquire about the school's directly superior authority and then forward it for investigation." Therefore, the person in charge called Hubei and the Central South Workers' and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School. But no one named Secretary Huang could be found. Then, the words "Unable to find" were written on the slip. After ten days, it was found out that there was a Tian Xuzhao in the Central South Workers' and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, and the letter was forwarded to the Central South Department of Education, which led the school, for investigation. However, when the Central South People's Supervisory Committee copied and forwarded this letter, it concealed Tian Xuzhao's name, and the copyist wrote "Copied by Zhang Zeling" at the end. The Central South Department of Education immediately considered it to be "Zhang Zeling, a student of the Workers' and Peasants Secondary School, reported Huang Tao, a secretary of the Workers' and Peasants Secondary School," and sent the letter to the Construction Committee of the Central China Higher Normal School, which led the school, for investigation.

The Construction Committee of the Central China Higher Normal School handed it over to the Central South Workers and Peasants Secondary School for investigation and found that the Workers and Peasants Secondary School had neither the position of secretary nor a person named Huang Tao, and that there were no students named Zhang Zeling. Therefore, the original was "returned" (original letter language) to the Central South Department of Education. Although the Central South Department of Education still showed "importance" to people's letters, emphasizing that it was assigned by the Central South People's Supervisory Committee and must be thoroughly investigated, they never carefully studied the content of the letter. Because the facts being reported, such as "unreasonable use of cadres, not training factory financial accounting cadres in the second half of the year, but doing other work," clearly referred to the Workers' and Staff School, not the Workers' and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School. Moreover, although the reporter "Zhang Zeling" may be an alias, the reported person "Huang Tao" would certainly not be an alias, especially since the Workers' and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School did not have a secretary position. It can be seen that the Central South Department of Education also copied and forwarded the letter without even noticing the "Workers' and Staff School" written on it.

After receiving the report from the Construction Committee of the Central China Higher Normal School stating "No such person found," the Central South Department of Education wrote a letter to the Central South People's Supervisory Committee, but this letter was marked "File for reference" by a supervisory commissioner of the Central South People's Supervisory Committee, followed by a tail "Check again on the phone." But this did not attract the attention of the person in charge, so no further checks were made.

The Central South Department of Education ordered the Construction Committee of the Central China Higher Normal School to thoroughly investigate; the Construction Committee then ordered the Workers and Peasants Secondary School to investigate again. The Workers and Peasants Secondary School, after studying the target of the original report and contacting relevant schools in Wuhan, found out that there was a Secretary Huang in the Workers' and Staff School of the Central South Geological Bureau. Only then did it become clear that the accused person was a cadre of the Workers' and Staff School of the Central South Geological Bureau. The Central South People's Supervisory Committee then transferred the original to the Central South Geological Bureau for handling. After being transferred back and forth like this, it took forty-seven days to find a clue.

But the problem has not yet been solved.

Later, the Central South People's Supervisory Committee received more reports from Tian Xuzhao and the people's supervision correspondent of the Workers' and Staff School of the Central South Geological Bureau, all related to the school's suppression of democracy and chaotic teaching situation. It forwarded them to the Geological Bureau three times for joint handling and frequently called and sent people to urge them, but after another three months, there was still no result. The Central South Geological Bureau initially delayed and ignored the matter, then sent people to understand the situation at the school, and then used the excuse that Huang Tao had taken maternity leave to temporarily not deal with it. In fact, the problem does not lie solely with Huang Tao. Huang Tao did not take leave for more than a month before, and besides, Huang Tao is not the main person in charge of the Workers' and Staff School. Why doesn't the Central South Geological Bureau seize the time to deal with it and give an explanation!

This incident exposed a series of bureaucratic and red-tape styles in some of our state organs, which failed to handle people's letters responsibly. It is necessary to thoroughly examine and correct this in the anti-bureaucracy struggle.

### 不容许把群众来信“照抄照转”

    不容许把群众来信“照抄照转”
    读者罗乃文来信：中南工农速成中学田旭照同志在去年冬天写信给中南人民监察委员会，检举中南地质局所属职工学校领导人官僚主义、压制批评的错误。但是中南人民监察委员会处理这封信的工作人员连被检举者是谁都没有看清，就“来文照转”出去，结果转错了地方，以致这封信绕了几个圈子，经过四十七天之久，才转到中南地质局。又由于中南地质局不重视人民来信，一直拖延，又压了三个月还没有彻底处理。
    田旭照原是中南地质局职工学校的工作人员，并担任人民监察通讯员的职务。去冬调中南工农速成中学学习。到了工农速成中学以后，他将自己所了解的关于中南地质局职工学校秘书黄陶等人压制民主的一些问题，向中南人民监察委员会写了一个报告。本来在田旭照所写的材料和附信中都明白写着“职工学校”的字样，从材料内容也可以看出被检举者并非工农中学。但中南人民监察委员会首先处理这份材料的同志只根据来信寄件处是“工农中学”，就在来文处理笺填上“反映工农中学领导压制民主，采取打击报复，群众对黄秘书有意见不敢提。”处长也就照例批示：“打电话询明该校直属上级机关后再转其查处。”于是承办人就打电话问湖北和中南工农速成中学。但都找不到有黄秘书其人。乃又在笺上写“无法找”三字。经过十天之久，才问出中南工农速成中学有一个田旭照，就把来信转到领导该校的中南教育部查处。但是中南人民监察委员会在抄转这封信的时候，隐去了田旭照的名字，缮写人在后面写上“张泽菱抄”四字。中南教育部即认为是“工农中学学员张泽菱检举工农中学秘书黄陶”，遂把信函送领导该校的华中高等师范建校委员会查处。
    华中高等师范建校委员会交中南工农中学查了一下，发现工农中学既无秘书一职，又无黄陶其人，学员也没有叫张泽菱的，故将原件“奉还”（原函用语）中南教育部。中南教育部虽然仍旧表现了“重视”人民来信，强调是中南人民监察委员会交办的，必须查清，但他们却始终没有好好研究信件内容。因为所检举的事实，如“对干部使用不合理，下半年不培养工厂财务会计干部，而作其它工作”等，一望而知指的不是工农速成中学。而且检举人“张泽菱”虽可能是化名，但被检举人“黄陶”则绝不致是化名，何况工农速成中学就没有秘书一职。可见中南教育部也是照抄照转，连信上写的“职工学校”也没有看出。
    中南教育部在收到华中高等师范建校委员会“查无此人”的报告后，曾写信告诉中南人民监察委员会，但这封信却被中南人民监察委员会的一位监察专员批上“存查”两字，后面拖了一个尾巴“再在电话上查对一下”。但这并没有引起承办人的重视，就没有再去查对。
    中南教育部令华中高等师范建校委员会彻底查清；该建校委员会又令工农中学再查。工农中学在研究了原件所检举的对象，并与武汉市有关学校联系，才查出中南地质局职工学校有一个黄秘书。这时才弄清被控告者是中南地质局职工学校的干部。中南人民监察委员会遂把原件转交中南地质局处理。这样转来转出，经过了四十七天，才算找到了头绪。
    可是问题还没有解决。
    中南人民监察委员会以后又收到田旭照和中南地质局职工学校人民监察通讯员的反映材料，都是有关该校压制民主和教学上混乱的情况，曾先后三次转去地质局一并处理，又经常打电话和派人催办，但又过三个月了，仍没有个结果。中南地质局始则拖延不理，继则派人到该校了解了一下，又以黄陶请了产假为借口，暂不处理。其实问题并不在黄陶一人身上，前一个多月黄陶并没有请假，何况黄陶并非职工学校的主要负责人，为什么中南地质局不抓紧处理，作个交代呢！
    这件事暴露了我们某些国家机关一系列的官僚主义和文牍主义作风，对于人民来信没有做到认真负责的处理，必须在反官僚主义斗争中彻底检查纠正。
