After the "May Day" International Labor Day, on the third day, in a beautiful auditorium by the West Lake in early summer, we—the慰问团 (comfort delegation) organized by the Zhejiang news and publishing circles—met with the Volunteer Army convalescents who were recuperating here. What a moving scene, what an unforgettable moment! Everyone shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, no, it should be said, heart to heart, talking to each other to their hearts' content. The innocent young Pioneers climbed onto the chairs, gently touched the heads of the convalescents, and asked, "Is your head okay?" Then, they gently touched the necks of the convalescents and asked again, "Is your neck okay?" They wanted to touch and ask about everything from head to toe, until the convalescent comrades said, "I am healthy all over." Only then did a satisfied smile appear on their faces, and they sat down quietly, as if their little hearts had finally been comforted. A child of about ten years old was sitting next to me, talking to a convalescent comrade as if confiding in a relative he had been separated from for a long time: "Uncle, with you protecting us, I will study hard, and when I grow up, I will do more for the motherland."

The cadres of the organizations were vying to talk to the convalescent comrades about the things they were concerned about. From Anshan Iron and Steel to the Huai River, from Xinjiang to Hainan Island, from the new victories on the Korean battlefield to the great achievements of the anti-bureaucracy struggle within the organizations.

Speaking of the construction of the motherland, many convalescent comrades excitedly talked about how the great construction of the motherland and the happy life of the people of the motherland inspired them to fight heroically. A convalescent comrade named Xiang Jinfa, who grew up in the remote border province of Xikang, suddenly stopped when he talked about the most tense moments and took out a thick stack of photos wrapped in a red scarf given to him by the young Pioneers of the motherland. Among them were photos of Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Kim Il-sung; photos of his close comrades-in-arms; and photos of the beautiful scenery of the motherland. Some of these photos were given by the people of the motherland; others were given by comrades-in-arms during the intense fighting gaps for remembrance. He flipped through them for us one by one, and finally said, "Look, this is the source of our strength!"

Another convalescent comrade recounted to everyone how they captured American prisoners and how they led a platoon of soldiers to wipe out a company of enemies in battle. His name is Yang Chuanfang, and he grew up in Chairman Mao's hometown—he often felt that this was his honor, and he often used this to encourage himself to fight more heroically. He spoke so vividly, lively, and movingly that everyone was fascinated. Finally, everyone realized that he had said too much and was a little tired. I opened the window and asked him to admire the scenery outside the window. At this time, the hillside was lush green, the treetops were full of red flowers, the fields were surging with wheat waves, the lake was rippling with microwaves, and the cool breeze of early summer was blowing in our faces, what a moving landscape painting! I naturally thought of the descriptions of the scenery of Korea in many Korean dispatches and couldn't help but ask him in a low voice, "Is it very cold in Korea in winter? I heard that the snow is several feet thick?" "No," he replied, "there is also spring in Korea in winter." Seeing our hesitant expressions, he continued to explain: "The winter in Korea is indeed very cold, but our hearts are always warm. Because we think: with us guarding in the tunnels on the front line in Korea, the factories of the motherland can emit smoke, the fields can grow vigorously, and the children can sleep soundly beside their mothers.... This beautiful scenery outside the window always exists in our hearts when we are in Korea. It is a force that inspires us!"

"The motherland is so warm, the people of the motherland are so enthusiastic to us, I am determined to recuperate with peace of mind and strive to return to the front line in Korea as soon as possible!" The excited voice of another convalescent comrade aroused a memorable memory in me:

During those sad days of Stalin's death, I came here once. I will never forget the scene that day: the walls of the room were covered with letters of determination—from Party groups, League groups, and individuals. These letters of determination all reflected their common wish: we are Stalin's loyal internationalist fighters, we are determined to recuperate with peace of mind and strive to return to the front line in Korea as soon as possible, and mourn Comrade Stalin with practical actions to severely打击(strike) the enemy!

On that day, I met several Volunteer Army convalescent comrades here, including Qing Dukun. Today I really want to talk to them again, but I can't find them. A comrade pointed to the distant northeast and told us:

"After they recovered their health, they returned to the forefront of 抗美援朝(Resist America, Aid Korea)."

I looked in the direction he pointed and silently thought in my heart: Heroes, forged from steel, they are forever standing on the front line of defending the motherland!

    他们永远战斗在前线
    张若煌
    “五一”国际劳动节过后的第三天，在初夏的西湖边上一所漂亮的大礼堂里，我们——浙江新闻出版界组织的慰问团和在这里休养的志愿军休养员见面了。多么动人的场面，多么难忘的时刻啊！大家肩并着肩，手拉着手，不，应该说是心连着心地尽情交谈着。天真的少年儿童队员们，爬在椅子上，温存地摸摸休养员的头，问一句：你的头好吗？又温存地摸摸休养员的脖子，再问一句：你的脖子好吗？从头到脚，他们都要摸一摸，问一问，一直到休养员同志说：“我全身都很健康。”他们的脸上才露出满足的微笑，安静地坐了下来，仿佛他们那颗小小的心灵最后得到了安慰一样。在我旁边坐着一个十岁左右的孩子，好像和分别很久的亲人谈心似地在和休养员同志谈着话：“叔叔，有你们保护我们，我要好好念书，将来长大了，要为祖国做多多的事情。”
    机关干部们，争着向休养员同志谈着他们所关心的事情。从鞍钢谈到淮河，从新疆谈到海南岛，从朝鲜战场的新胜利谈到机关内部反官僚主义斗争的巨大成就。
    一提到祖国的建设，很多休养员同志都兴奋地谈起祖国的伟大建设和祖国人民幸福的生活如何鼓舞着他们英勇战斗的生动故事。一个生长在祖国遥远的边境西康省，名叫向金发的休养员同志，在谈到最紧张的时候，他突然住了口，从口袋里掏出来用祖国少年儿童队员献给他的一块红领巾包着的一厚叠照片。其中有斯大林、毛主席、金日成的照片；有他的亲密战友的照片；有祖国美丽的风景照片。这些照片，有的是祖国人民送的；有的是战友们在激烈的战斗空隙中为了留念送的。他一张张地翻给我们看，末了才说：“看，这就是我们力量的源泉！”
    另一个休养员同志给大家叙述起他们怎样抓美国俘虏，怎样带一个排的战士消灭敌人一个连的战斗故事。他的名字叫杨传芳，生长在毛主席的故乡——他常常觉得这是自己的荣誉，并常常以此勉励自己更英勇的战斗。他讲得那么生动、活泼、感人，大家都着了迷。最后，大家才发现他说得太多，有点累了。我打开了窗户，请他欣赏一下窗外的风光。这时，山坡上一片葱绿，树梢上挂满了红花，田野里翻起麦浪，湖面上荡漾着微波，初夏的凉风迎面扑来，好一幅动人的风景画啊！我很自然地联想起在许多朝鲜通讯中关于朝鲜景色的描写，不禁低声问他：“冬天，在朝鲜很冷吧，听说雪有几尺厚？”“不，”他答复，“在朝鲜，冬天里也有春天。”他看到我们犹疑的神情，接着又解释道：“朝鲜的冬天的确很冷，但我们的心里却总是暖烘烘的。因为我们想到：有我们守卫在朝鲜前线的坑道里，祖国的工厂就可以冒烟，田野里就可以生长旺盛的庄稼，孩子也可以在母亲的身旁熟睡……。像窗外这幅美景，在朝鲜时，老是存在我们的心里。它就是鼓舞我们的一种力量！”
    “祖国真温暖，祖国的人民对我们真热情，我决心安心休养，争取早日回到朝鲜前线去！”另一位休养员同志激动的声音，引起我的一段难忘的回忆：
    在斯大林逝世的那些悲痛的日子里，我曾经来过这里一次。那天的情景我永远也不会忘记：屋子的墙上，贴满了决心书——党小组的、团小组的和个人的。这些决心书都反映出他们的共同愿望：我们是斯大林同志的伟大国际主义的忠实战士，我们决心安心休养，争取早日回到朝鲜前线，用狠狠打击敌人的实际行动来悼念斯大林同志！
    当天，我曾经在这里认识了卿笃坤等好几个志愿军休养员同志。今天我很想再和他们谈谈，可是都找不到了。一个同志指着东北的远方告诉我们：
    “他们在恢复健康后又回到抗美援朝最前线去了。”
    我向他手指的方向看去，心中默默思念：英雄，钢铁打成的，他们永远站在保卫祖国的最前线！
