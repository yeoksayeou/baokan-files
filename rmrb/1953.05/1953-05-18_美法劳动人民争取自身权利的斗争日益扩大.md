Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th: The Soviet "Pravda" published an article by I. Filippov, commenting on the growing struggle of the American laboring people for their rights.

Filippov wrote in the article: According to the materials of the U.S. Department of Labor, in the first three months of this year alone, there were 1,300 strikes in the United States, involving 550,000 workers. A total of 3,350,000 working days were lost due to strikes. Materials from part of April show that the U.S. strike movement is continuing to rise.

Filippov continued: Many facts prove that U.S. monopoly capitalists have recently been intensifying their attacks on the living standards of the laboring people. "General Electric" and one of the largest wool companies in the United States, "American Woolen Company," have both announced that they intend to reduce workers' wages. According to union newspapers, wage cuts also threaten 1.3 million railroad employees, 50,000 textile workers, 75,000 "International Harvester Company" workers, 400,000 "General Motors" workers, and a large number of workers in other companies in the automotive industry.

Monopoly capitalists use changes in the cost of living index as an excuse to demand wage cuts. According to official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. cost of living index supposedly fell by 1.6 percent in the quarter ending in mid-February 1953. Union newspapers pointed out that this is completely untrue, because the official cost of living index does not include many expenses that occupy an important position in the budget of an average American family.

Filippov wrote: While infringing on the wages of the laboring people, monopoly capitalists are clamoring for the need to "guarantee reasonable profits for business owners." In plain language, this means that monopoly capitalists are demanding higher profits, even though their profits are increasing quarter by quarter.

Filippov pointed out that monopoly capital groups are also trying to deprive or restrict the right of the laboring people to strike. The U.S. Congress is discussing "revising" the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law. In the process of discussion, a number of "revisions" have already been passed, and some bills aimed at undermining the position of trade unions in the struggle against monopoly capitalists have been put forward.

Filippov concluded that American workers are increasingly aware of the threat posed by monopoly capitalists to the trade union movement. Despite the opposition of reactionary union leaders of the AFL and CIO, grassroots unions in the United States are increasingly intensifying their demands for the laboring people to unite and fight to defend their rights.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 16th: On the 12th, Paris subway and bus workers responded to the call of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and held a 24-hour general strike, demanding a monthly wage increase of 4,000 francs. This was their fourth strike in a month. Right-wing Socialist, Catholic, and so-called "independent" trade union organizations announced that they would not participate in the strike. However, according to the CGT's public announcement, 80 to 85 percent of subway workers and 95 percent of bus workers participated in the strike.

Among the laboring people in other industries, the strike movement to improve living standards is also developing. On the 7th, most of the power station workers in Paris went on strike for one hour. Paris restaurant workers, who have been holding sporadic strikes to demand that employers pay their outstanding meal allowances, met on the 13th to prepare for a general strike. Postal workers, government employees, and workers in clothing, hotels, groceries, milk, slaughtering, flour, and other industries are all brewing strikes.

Renault automobile factory workers, who have been on strike for almost a month, temporarily resumed work on the 11th in accordance with the union's decision, but their struggle to improve living standards and defend trade union rights is continuing. On the 13th, they went on strike again due to factory layoffs. French port merchant seamen, with the support of dockworkers and other harbor workers, continue to strike. On the 11th alone, 120 merchant ships could not sail from ports along the French Mediterranean coast. Ports such as Le Havre, Bordeaux, and Rouen remain at a standstill.

### 美法劳动人民争取自身权利的斗争日益扩大

    美法劳动人民争取自身权利的斗争日益扩大
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：苏联“真理报”发表伊·费利波夫的一篇文章，评论美国劳动人民争取自己权利的日益扩大的斗争。
    费利波夫在文章里写道：根据美国劳工部的材料，仅仅在今年头三个月内，美国就发生了一千三百次罢工，参加罢工的有五十五万职工。由于罢工而损失了三百三十五万个工作日。从四月份的一部分材料可以看出，美国罢工运动正在继续高涨。
    费利波夫继续写道：许多事实证明，美国垄断资本家最近正在向劳动人民的生活水平加紧进攻。“通用电气公司”与美国最大的羊毛公司之一——“美国羊毛公司”，都宣称它们打算减少职工的工资。据工会报纸报道，降低工资措施还威胁着一百三十万名铁路员工，五万名纺织工人，七万五千名“国际收割机公司”的工人，四十万名“通用汽车公司”的工人和汽车工业其他公司的大批工人。
    垄断资本家以生活费用指数的变动为借口，要求降低工资。根据劳工统计局的官方统计，在一九五三年二月中旬为止的一个季度内，美国生活费用指数好像下降了百分之一点六。工会报纸指出：这是完全不符合事实的，因为官方的生活费用指数并没有把在一个普通美国家庭预算中占重要地位的许多费用计算在内。
    费利波夫写道：垄断资本家一方面侵犯劳动人民的工资，另一方面则在叫嚣必须“保证企业主的合理利润”。用普通的话来说，这就是垄断资本家要求更高的利润，虽然他们的利润正在一季比一季增加。
    费利波夫指出，垄断资本集团还竭力打算剥夺或限制劳动人民的罢工权利。美国国会正在讨论“修改”塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法。在讨论过程中，已经通过了不少的“修改”，而且提出了一些旨在破坏工会在和垄断资本家进行斗争中的地位的法案。
    费利波夫最后写道，美国劳动者越来越认识到垄断资本家对工会运动的威胁。美国基层工会正不顾劳联和产联的反动工会领袖的反对，日益加紧要求劳动人民团结起来，为保卫自己的权利而斗争。
    【新华社十六日讯】巴黎消息：十二日，巴黎地下电车和公共汽车工人响应法国总工会的号召，举行二十四小时总罢工，要求每月增加工资四千法郎。这是一个月来他们的第四次罢工。右翼社会党、天主教和所谓“独立”的工会组织宣布不参加罢工，但是，据总工会公报，百分之八十到八十五的地下电车工人和百分之九十五的公共汽车工人，都参加了罢工。
    在其他各业劳动人民中间，争取改善生活的罢工运动也正在发展。七日，巴黎大部分电力站工人都罢工一小时。为要求资方付清伙食津贴欠款而不断举行零星罢工的巴黎餐馆工人，在十三日开会，准备举行总罢工。邮局职工、政府雇员以及服装、旅馆、杂货、牛奶、屠宰、面粉等各业工人，都在酝酿罢工。
    坚持罢工快一个月的雷诺汽车工厂工人遵照工会的决定，在十一日暂时复工，但是他们所进行的改善生活和保卫工会权利的斗争仍在继续。十三日，由于厂方解雇工人，他们又举行了罢工。法国各港口商船职工在码头工人及其他海港工人的支持下，继续罢工。仅在十一日一天，法国地中海沿岸各港口就有一百二十条商船无法开行。哈佛尔、波尔多、卢昂等港口仍然陷于停顿。
