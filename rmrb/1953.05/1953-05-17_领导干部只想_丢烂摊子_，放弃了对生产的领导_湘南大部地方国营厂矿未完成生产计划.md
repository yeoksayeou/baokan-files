Leading Cadres Only Want to "Dump the Mess," Abandoning Leadership of Production
Most Local State-Owned Factories and Mines in Southern Hunan Fail to Meet Production Plans

Most local state-owned factories and mines in Southern Hunan did not complete their production and financial plans for the first quarter. According to statistics from twenty factories and mines directly under the Xiangnan Administrative Office: the average completion rate of the first quarter's production plan was only 91.8%. Among them, only four units, namely Matian Coal Mine, Lingling Lumber Factory, Lianxin Flour Mill, and Xinxin Flour Mill, completed or exceeded their production plans, while other units failed to do so. The completion of the financial plan was even worse; the payments submitted by the factories and mines in the first quarter only reached 5.2% of the original plan.

The main reason why most local state-owned factories and mines in Southern Hunan failed to complete their production and financial plans for the first quarter is that most factory and mine leaders mistakenly believed that large-scale economic construction had begun and that local industry had no future. They harbored the thought of "dumping the mess," only wanting to close down and transfer to large factories and mines or basic construction units as soon as possible, and were therefore not dedicated to their current work. For example, the director of the Lingling Fire Brick Factory always believed that the factory had no future and completely abandoned leadership over production, resulting in extremely chaotic production and many defective products. In February, 38.614 tons of bricks were fired in the square kiln, but only 17.8 tons were finished products. In March, the state assigned the factory an order for a batch of special-shaped bricks, but the factory leaders did not conduct in-depth research to overcome the defects in the blanking process, but instead manufactured a large number of "parallel bricks." Since "parallel bricks" originally had poor sales, a large number of products were stockpiled, seriously affecting the completion of the production plan and the turnover of funds. The leading cadres of the Lingling Victory Machinery Factory also had the idea of "dumping the mess," did not study their business thoroughly, and were irresponsible for production. When undertaking the manufacture of bone meal machines for the bone meal factory, the factory director did not review the drawings or study the specifications. After completion, an explosion occurred in the steam cylinder during the trial run, injuring three workers. After an inspection, the factory director realized that the specifications were incorrect. Because of the lack of leadership in production, the factory has rarely produced finished products since August last year, and the waste caused by rework is about 600 million yuan. The Lingling Textile and Dyeing Factory also suffered from the fact that the leading cadres harbored the idea of "dumping the mess" and did not try to improve production. The cost of products was too high and the quality was too poor, which did not meet market needs, resulting in a large backlog of products. The factory had 1.7 billion yuan in working capital, but the stockpiled products reached 1.8 billion yuan, causing production to stagnate.

In order to reverse this situation, the Xiangnan Administrative Office's Industry and Mining Management Department is vigorously implementing the spirit of the Second Industry and Mining Conference of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, calling on the leading cadres of various factories and mines to overcome the idea of "dumping the mess," immediately delve into their work, earnestly do a good job in the production of existing factories, accumulate funds, and support basic construction.

### 领导干部只想“丢烂摊子”，放弃了对生产的领导  湘南大部地方国营厂矿未完成生产计划

    领导干部只想“丢烂摊子”，放弃了对生产的领导
    湘南大部地方国营厂矿未完成生产计划
    湘南地方国营厂矿大都没有完成第一季度的生产财务计划。据湘南行署直属二十个厂矿的统计：第一季度的生产计划，平均只完成百分之九十一点八，其中除马田煤矿、零陵制材厂、联新面粉厂、新新面粉厂等四个单位完成或超额完成生产计划外，其他单位都没有完成。财务计划完成得更差，第一季度各厂矿上缴款项，只完成原计划的百分之五点二。
    湘南地方国营厂矿大都没有完成第一季度生产财务计划的最主要原因，是大部分厂矿的领导干部错误地认为大规模的经济建设开始了，地方工业没有前途，存在“丢烂摊子”思想，只想早些关门收摊子，到大厂矿和基本建设单位去工作，因而不安心做现在的工作。例如零陵火砖厂厂长就一直认为厂子没有前途，完全放弃了对生产的领导，致使生产情况极端混乱，废品很多。二月份方窑烧砖三十八点六一四吨，成品只有十七点八吨。三月份，国家交给该厂一批特型砖的订货，该厂领导干部不深入研究，克服制坯的毛病，反而大量制造“并行砖”；而“并行砖”本来销路就不好，所以，产品大批积压起来，严重地影响了生产计划的完成和资金的周转。零陵胜利机械厂领导干部同样有“丢烂摊子”思想，对业务不钻研，对生产不负责任。在承制骨粉厂的骨粉机时，厂长不审查图样，又不研究规格，做成后刚试车，便发生了蒸缸爆炸事故，炸伤工人三名。事后一检查，厂长才知道是规格不合。因为生产缺乏领导，该厂从去年八月到现在，很少制出成品，因返工造成的浪费在六亿元左右。零陵织染厂也因领导干部抱着“丢烂摊子”思想，不想法改进生产，产品成本太高，质量太差，不合市场需要，造成产品大量积压。该厂原有流动资金十七亿元，积压的产品却达十八亿元，使生产陷于停顿状态。
    湘南行署工矿管理处为了扭转这种情况，正大力贯彻中共湖南省委第二次工矿会议精神，号召各厂矿领导干部克服“丢烂摊子”思想，立即钻下去，认真搞好现厂生产，积累资金，支援基本建设。
