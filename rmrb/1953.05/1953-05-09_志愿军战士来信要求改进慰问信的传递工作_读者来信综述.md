Volunteer Army Soldiers' Letters Request Improved Delivery of Comfort Letters
-- Readers' Letters Summary

    Recently, many Volunteer Army soldiers have written from the Korean front, reporting the great encouragement that comfort letters from the people of the motherland have given to the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters. At the same time, they raised concerns about the overly slow delivery of some comfort letters. Chi Ye, Wan Fufeng, and 15 others from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army wrote: "This April, we successively received a large number of comfort letters from the people of the motherland, but some letters arrived too late, preventing them from playing a greater role. Among the letters we recently received, some were even mailed in 1951." Dai Zhenya and five others from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "A letter written by Fu Wenqi, a sixth-grade student from Donghua Guan Elementary School in Chongqing City on October 25, 1951, took seventeen months to reach us." Soldiers Liu Chunguang and Zhu Zhenhua from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote: "We are looking forward day and night to receiving letters from the people of the motherland, but among the large number of letters we recently received, some were from last April, and the content described the situations of the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' campaigns. Due to the slow delivery, the effect of these letters has been greatly reduced."

    In their letters, the Volunteer Army comrades also put forward their requirements for improving this situation. Chi Ye and others from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army pointed out in their letter: relevant departments should improve the method of delivering comfort letters, minimize procedures, and achieve timely and accurate delivery, to meet the needs of the Volunteer Army and the entrustment of the people of the motherland. In addition, the Volunteer Army comrades also hope that the people of the motherland will pay attention to the legibility of their handwriting when writing letters, and write the name and mailing address of the letter writer clearly, so that the Volunteer Army soldiers can reply.

    志愿军战士来信要求改进慰问信的传递工作
    ——读者来信综述
    最近不少志愿军战士从朝鲜前线来信，报告了祖国人民的慰问信对志愿军指战员的巨大鼓舞作用；同时对有一些慰问信传递过于迟缓的情况提出了意见。中国人民志愿军某部赤野、万扶风等十七人来信说：“今年四月份我们先后接到祖国人民给我们的大宗慰问信，但有些信件寄到时间过晚，以致不能发挥它更大的作用。在最近收到的这些信件中，有些竟是一九五一年寄出的。”志愿军某部戴振亚等六人来信说：“重庆市东华观小学六上队员傅文琪小朋友于一九五一年十月二十五日写的信，辗转十七个月才到达我们手中。”志愿军某部战士刘春光、朱震华来信说：“我们日夜盼望着祖国人民的来信，但最近接到的大批信件，其中有一些是去年四月的，所写的内容是‘三反’、‘五反’的情况，因传递工作的迟缓，大大减低了这些信件的效果。”
    志愿军同志们在来信中又提出了他们对改进这种情况的要求。志愿军某部赤野等在来信中指出：有关部门应改善慰问信传递的方法，尽量减少手续，达到传递及时和准确，以满足志愿军的要求和祖国人民的委托。此外，志愿军同志还希望祖国人民在写信时注意字迹不要潦草，并将写信人姓名和通信地址写清楚，以便志愿军战士回信。
