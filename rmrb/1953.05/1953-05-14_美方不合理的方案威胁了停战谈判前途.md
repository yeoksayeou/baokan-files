Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 13th: This reporter reports: The delegations from both sides held a meeting on May 13. At the meeting, the chief representative of the other side, Harrison, spoke and put forward a completely unreasonable proposal.

In the proposal, the other side reiterated its past claims, which overturned the basis of the negotiations and had been firmly opposed by our side, demanding that those personnel of the Korean People's Army who were captured and not directly repatriated be released in situ when the armistice came into effect. At the same time, although the other side's proposal stipulates that those personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were captured and not directly repatriated should be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, it shortens the interpretation period for the relevant party regarding these personnel from the reasonable period of four months proposed by our side to two months, and stipulates that after the two-month period expires, those who have not been repatriated will be released in situ, instead of entrusting the handling of these people to political conferences for consultation and resolution, as advocated by our side. The other side is obviously attempting to implement its demand for forcibly detaining our captured personnel in substance through this method of in-situ release.

Regarding the explanation work of one of the parties, in addition to stipulating a time limit of two months, the other party's plan also stipulates that the number of people who can explain to the prisoners of war is limited to a maximum of one person per thousand prisoners of war, and a minimum of no less than five people.

The other party formally accepted our proposal that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission be composed of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and India, but in essence stipulated that only India could send military police to assume the common responsibilities of the five countries. The remaining four countries could only send one representative and no more than ten assistants, and stipulated that when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was guarding the prisoners of war, the detaining party could send security forces and administrative personnel.

Regarding the completely unreasonable proposal of the US side, General Nan Ri solemnly pointed out that the other side not only did not accept the two reasonable proposals put forward by our side on April 26 and May 7 to solve the problem, but instead took a step backward from the three suggestions put forward in the other side's letter of April 16, which was obviously not an attitude that should be taken in negotiations. The plan put forward by the other side based on this attitude threatens the future of the entire armistice negotiation. The other party's proposal is something that our side firmly cannot agree to, and we demand that the other party reconsider.

### 美方不合理的方案威胁了停战谈判前途

    美方不合理的方案威胁了停战谈判前途
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者报道：五月十三日双方代表团举行会议。会上对方首席代表哈利逊发言，并提出了一个完全不合理的方案。
    对方在方案中再次重复提出其过去的推翻谈判基础并已被我方坚决反对的主张，要求在停战生效时，将朝鲜人民军被俘人员中未被直接遣返者就地释放。同时，对方方案虽已规定将中国人民志愿军被俘人员中未被直接遣返者交由中立国遣返委员会看管，但是要将有关一方对这些人员的解释期限，从我方所提合理期限的四个月缩短为两个月，并规定在两个月期满之后，即将其中未被遣返者就地释放，而不是如我方所主张的将对这些人的处理办法交由政治会议协商解决。对方显然企图以这种就地释放的办法来在实质上贯彻其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的主张。
    在有关一方的解释工作一点上，对方方案除规定了两个月为期的时限之外，还规定对战俘进行解释的人数，每一千个战俘中最多只能派一人，最低限度不能少于五人。
    对方在形式上接受了我方所提由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士和印度组成中立国遣返委员会的主张，但在实质上则规定只有印度一国能派遣军事警察来担任五个国家的共同职责，其余四国只能派遣一名代表和不超过十人的助理人员，并规定在中立国遣返委员会看管战俘时，拘留一方可以派遣保安部队和行政人员。
    对于美方的这一完全不合理的方案，南日大将严正指出，对方不但没有接受我方在四月二十六日和五月七日先后提出的两个合理方案来解决问题，反而从对方四月十六日来信中所提出的三点建议倒退了一步，这显然不是谈判所应有的态度。对方根据这种态度所提的方案威胁了整个停战谈判的前途。对方方案是我方坚决不能同意的，要求对方重予考虑。
