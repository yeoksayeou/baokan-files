    The Water Conservancy Committee of the Third District of Hejin County Organizes the Masses to Use Water Sources in a Planned Way
    Letters from Ren Yingjie, Wei Tianxi, Yang Jingxiu, and Fei Yongxian of the Agricultural and Forestry Department of Hejin County, Shanxi Province: During the spring drought season, the Water Conservancy Committee of the Third District of Hejin County timely studied methods to conserve water and irrigate more land, ensuring the timely planting of cotton fields in the clear water area. On April 22nd, they convened a meeting of water conservancy cadres from various clear water villages and worked out the following measures: 1. Timely water reception and delivery, irrigation following the water flow, and people not leaving the water until the land is fully irrigated; 2. According to the water volume, disperse where appropriate and concentrate where appropriate, dividing into small plots and small ridges, irrigating shallowly and planting early, without wasting water; 3. Fully mobilize the masses to overcome selfish ideas, resolutely implement water regulations, not competing for water, not stealing water, irrigating and planting simultaneously. After the meeting, village cadres publicized the methods to the masses, and the farmers supported the measures. From April 23rd to the 7th of this month, due to the full utilization of water sources, 1,000 mu of cotton fields in Qianjian, Guzhen, Hejiazhuang, and other villages in the district have been planted in a timely manner. Many people reflected: If it weren't for such orderly irrigation, who knows how many cotton fields would not have been planted this year!

    河津县三区水利委员会组织群众有计划地使用水源
    山西省河津县农林科任英杰、魏天锡、杨景秀、费永贤来信：河津县三区水利委员会在春旱季节中适时地研究了省水多浇地的办法，保证清水地区的棉田适时下种。他们在四月二十二日召集各清水村庄的水利干事开会，研究出以下办法：一，接水、送水及时，跟水行浇，地不浇完人不离水；二，按水量大小，该分散的分散，该集中的集中，划小畛分小畦，浅浇早下种，不浪费水；三，充分发动群众克服自私自利思想，坚决执行水规，不争水，不偷水，随浇随种。会后各村干部向群众进行了宣传，农民们都很拥护这个办法。从四月二十三日到本月七日，由于充分利用了水源，该区千涧、固镇、何家庄等村一千亩棉田已适时下种。不少群众反映：要不是这样有秩序的灌田，今年不知有好多棉田要种不上！
