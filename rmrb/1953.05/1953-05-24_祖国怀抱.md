　　Not long after the motorcade passed Dingzhou, it dawned, and the American planes could no longer harass them. In the morning sky, our valiant "Silver Swallows" appeared, weaving through the white clouds above the motorcade, drawing white smoke trails as if to tell the passengers in the cars below and the peaceful residents of Korea: Rest assured on your journey and in your work, we are guarding your safety in the sky.

　　The motorcade, consisting of twenty-eight vehicles carrying two hundred and forty-four excited passengers—People's Volunteer Army soldiers who had recently been repatriated due to illness and injury—sped northward. They sang loudly along the way, as if trying to reach the clouds, so that our "Silver Swallows" could hear them too.

　　"Buddy, the changes are so great! We stayed in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp for more than two years, and who could have imagined such big changes, always thinking the sky belonged to the American devils. Look, those formations are flying so freely! We've finally made it to the day we can breathe freely!" said a young man of about twenty-two. He sat on his luggage, holding onto the side of the truck with one hand, his spirits high, squinting as he looked up at the sky.

　　"It wasn't easy, buddy," said Squad Leader Zhang, sitting to the young man's right, thoughtfully. It was unclear whether he meant it wasn't easy for them to have endured two years in the prisoner-of-war camp, or whether he meant it wasn't easy for his comrades to fight on the front lines and in the skies of Korea. He only said this one sentence and then fell silent. Clearly, he was thinking about far more than he was saying. The cars passed Yangshi, and someone said, "Only forty more li to see the Yalu River!" Someone else said, "Half an hour to Sinuiju, we'll cross the river by ten o'clock this morning." Someone said, "It's been more than two years, I wonder what changes have taken place in the motherland?" Someone said, "The closer I get to home, the faster my heart beats!" The young man nudged Squad Leader Zhang next to him and asked, "Squad Leader, why are you so quiet? Are you unhappy?" After a while, Old Zhang replied:

　　"I, Zhang, am not made of wood. How could I be unhappy to be able to return to the motherland today?" After a pause, he continued, "Little Deng, you don't know what's on my mind. A person can only die once, not twice; my life was saved, I didn't die on Geoje Island, nor did I die on Jeju Island. Who do you think saved us?" He paused, waiting for Little Deng's answer.

　　"The motherland! It was the powerful motherland that saved us. Wasn't it?"

　　"Right! You're right. I'm just thinking about how I should dedicate everything I have to the great construction of the motherland in the future..."

　　They chatted back and forth, not yet finished pouring out their hearts, when the cars in front stopped one after another.

　　"Sinuiju!" someone shouted.

　　In the blink of an eye, a large group of Korean old ladies, sisters-in-law, and girls dressed in colorful clothes poured out of the ruined buildings on both sides, waving flags and flowers in their hands, rushing to the cars. Following them were a group of Korean People's Army officers and soldiers. They shouted slogans, rushing over to shake hands with these long-separated loved ones. This was the last Korean city they would pass through today. This large group of people were representatives of the citizens and the army of Sinuiju, coming to the Yalu River to welcome their arrival, and also to see them off as they crossed the river. The Korean people sang Chinese songs, each sentence penetrating the hearts of these wounded and sick volunteers, leaving them unsure of how to respond. An old lady grabbed Old Zhang's sleeve, stuffing something into his hand. Old Zhang looked at the old lady, as if seeing his own mother, so moved that tears streamed down his face, and he couldn't say a word for a long time.

　　The emerald green Yalu River rushed towards them, and the cars sped across the river. The people in the cars awoke from the warm welcome atmosphere of the Korean people. When the faces of the brothers and sisters of the motherland were approaching them one second closer than the next, when the beloved motherland, which they had longed for in countless sleepless nights in the American prisoner-of-war camps, was appearing before them, whose heart could not be stirred?

　　In time with the rhythm of the rolling wheels, they sang loudly again, the resounding songs echoing over the Yalu River.

　　Before the singing stopped, the motorcade had arrived in Andong, and they saw the first city of the motherland, from which they had been separated for more than two years. Here they heard a sea of familiar voices of the motherland, and saw a sea of lovely welcoming crowds of the motherland. The wounded and sick comrades trembled their lips, with smiles and tears shining on their faces, and each person was not very clear about what they had seen at first glance. They only felt their hearts beating wildly, felt the warmth of the people passing through their bodies, a forest of hands beckoning to them, so many pairs of caring eyes looking at them, and the flowers that had begun to wither because they had been waiting for too long were stuffed into their arms... All of this passed by in a dreamlike state.

　　There was an old lady on the side of the road opposite the "Military Store" mending socks for the volunteers, who had seen the welcoming people waiting on the road since dawn. People were waiting on empty stomachs, with the feeling of a mother waiting for her child to be released from prison, determined not to eat until they saw their child. This old lady finally saw the loved ones the people were waiting for had arrived, she also, like everyone else, saw those simple and lovely faces, wiping her eyes with her sleeve while repeatedly saying:

　　"Thank God, thank God, they finally came back."

　　This unnamed old lady, perhaps has a child in Korea? Perhaps, some of them have worn the socks she mended? Who knows? But passersby understand: she is one of the many mothers who silently bless them for their safety. As long as peace does not triumph over war, a mother will not forget to bless them when she wakes up in the middle of the night.

　　Here, they began to see some of the achievements of the motherland's construction, but also saw the destruction of the peaceful life of the motherland's people by American imperialism. They saw the disaster areas bombed by enemy planes on May 10th and 11th. What words can express their anger? They couldn't find the words to say. Old Zhang saw that the beautiful residential areas at the foot of Zhenjiang Mountain had become a field of rubble, just like what he had seen in Pyongyang, Sukchon, Sinanju, Dingzhou, Sonchon, and other Korean towns. A representative welcoming them told him: when the bombing hadn't stopped, the work of rescuing the wounded and healing the sick, and clearing the disaster area, had already begun. The meaning was: the people at home, like the volunteer soldiers on the Korean battlefield, were working with a spirit of selflessness and sacrifice, and the enemy's destruction could not stop our construction.

　　Soon, they were sent to a place for rest—a hospital with beautiful scenery. The nurses helped them out of the car and settled them in warm wards filled with sunlight. In order to allow them to get enough rest and recover from the fatigue of two days and two nights of travel, they were not even allowed to do the small task of cutting their fingernails themselves. None of the nurses were idle. They were like treating their own brothers, sincere, kind, considerate, and doing it so satisfactorily and willingly.

　　All the thoughtful and meticulous arrangements that the motherland had made in order to restore their physical and mental health made them deeply feel the unparalleled warmth of the motherland. They had embraced the motherland with their whole lives, and they were willing to risk their lives, they did not want to be separated from the motherland. Now they have finally returned to the embrace of the motherland that they have been longing for day and night for more than two years. No one can ask them to leave her again.

    祖国怀抱
    黄谷柳
    汽车队驶过定州不久，天就亮了，美军的夜航机再不能骚扰他们了。晨空中，出现了我们矫健的“银燕”，它们在汽车队列头顶的白云间穿梭飞翔，来回画着白色的烟带，仿佛是要告诉下边车上的乘客和朝鲜的和平居民：你们放心赶路和干活吧，我们在天空中保卫着你们的安全呢。
    二十八辆汽车组成的汽车队，载着二百四十四个心情激动的乘客——不久前被遣返的中国人民志愿军病伤人员，向北飞驶。他们一路放声高歌，好像是要唱入云霄，让我们的“银燕”也听见似的。
    “伙计，你说变化多大呀！咱们呆在济州岛战俘营两年多，谁能想到有这样大的变化，一直还以为天空是美国鬼子的世界呢。你看呀，那一队队的飞得多写意！咱们到底也熬到出口气的今天了！”说话的是一个二十二岁左右的小伙子。他坐在自己的行李包上，一手扶住车栏，精神振奋，眯着眼睛仰望着天空。
    “不容易呵，伙计。”坐在小伙子右边的张班长含蓄地若有所思地这样说。不知道他是指的他们自己在战俘营中熬过了两年不容易呢，还是指的自己的战友们在火线上和朝鲜的天空中的斗争不容易呢？他只说了这么一句话，就一路沉默起来。很显然，他想的比他要说出来的不知道超过几百倍。汽车经过杨市，有人说，“还有四十里就看到鸭绿江啦！”有人说，“半个钟头能到新义州，上午十点钟准能过江。”有人说，“两年多了，不知道祖国变化成什么样了？”有人说，“越近家，我的心越跳得厉害了！”小伙子碰了一下旁边的张班长，问他：“班长，为什么不吭声？不高兴吗？”半晌，老张才答道：
    “我姓张的又不是木头做的，今天能够重回到祖国，怎么不高兴。”停一会，他又接着说：“小邓，你那里知道我的心事。一个人只能死一回，不能死两回；我这条命算是被救回来了，没死在巨济岛上，也没死在济州岛上，你说是谁救活我们的？”他停顿下来等待小邓的回答。
    “祖国！是强大的祖国救活我们的。不是吗？”
    “对！你说的不错。我就是在想，今后我应当怎样把我的一切都献给伟大祖国的建设事业……”
    他们你一句我一句地谈着，还没把一肚子话倾泻干净，前边的汽车一辆接着一辆地都停下来了。
    “新义州！”有人叫了一声。
    一眨眼功夫，从两旁的残破楼房里拥出了一大群穿着五颜六色的衣裳的朝鲜老大娘、大嫂子和姑娘们，她们挥动着手上的旗帜和鲜花，飞奔到车前来。跟在她们后边的是一群朝鲜人民军军官们和士兵们。他们高呼着口号，奔过来和这些久违的亲人拉手。这里是今天经过的朝鲜的最后一个城市。这一大群人是新义州市民代表和军队代表，到鸭绿江边来欢迎他们的到临，同时又是欢送他们过江的。朝鲜人民唱着中国歌曲，一声声一句句透过这些志愿军伤病人员的心里，叫他们不知道怎么回答才好。老张被一位老大娘拉着衣袖，不知道塞些什么东西在他手里。老张看着那老大娘，就仿佛是看到自己的母亲一样，激动得直流泪，嘴巴哆嗦半天也说不出一句话来。
    碧绿的鸭绿江向他们迎面扑来，汽车飞驶过江了。汽车上的人们从朝鲜人民热情迎送的氛围中清醒过来。当祖国兄弟姐妹的面容在一秒钟比一秒钟临近到自己面前的时候，当他们在美国战俘营中数不清的不眠之夜里所想念的可爱的祖国就在面前显现的时候，谁的心能够不激动呢？
    应着车轮滚动的节奏，他们又激昂高歌起来，响亮的歌声飘荡在鸭绿江上。
    歌声未停，车队已经到了安东，他们看到了分别两年多的祖国的第一座城市。这里听到的是一片亲切的祖国的声音，看到的是一片可爱的祖国的欢迎的人群。伤病人员同志们颤动着嘴唇，含着笑，脸上闪着泪光，每一个人都不很清楚知道自己究竟第一眼瞧见了些什么。他们只感到他们的心在狂跳，感到人们的体温传过他们的身上，手的森林向他们招引，多少双关切的眼睛睇视着他们，因为等得时间太久而开始萎谢的花朵塞到他们的怀中……这一切，都在如梦如醉中过去了。
    有一位在“军人商店”对面马路边给志愿军缝补袜底的老大娘，她从天刚亮就看见欢迎的人们等待在马路上。人们空着肚子等待着，仿佛是母亲等待脱难出狱的孩子那样的心情，一定要等到见了孩子才吃得下饭。这老大娘终于看见人们等待的亲人已经到来了，她也跟大家一样，见到那些纯朴的可爱的脸孔了，她一边用袖口擦眼睛，一边连声说：
    “谢天谢地，谢天谢地，到底回来了。”
    这个不知姓名的老大娘，也许有个孩子在朝鲜吧？也许，他们中间有人穿过她缝补的袜子吧？有谁知道呢？但过路人明白：她是许许多多默默为他们的平安而祝福的母亲中间的一个。和平一天不战胜战争，作母亲的半夜醒来是不会忘记为他们祝福的。
    在这里，他们开始看到了祖国建设的一些成就，但也看到了美帝国主义对祖国人民和平生活的破坏。看到了在五月十日和十一日被敌机轰炸过的灾区。用什么话来表示自己的愤怒呢？他们找不出话来说。老张看见镇江山麓的那些美好的住宅区已变成一片瓦砾场，就像他在平壤、肃川、新安州、定州、宣川以及别的朝鲜城镇所看见过的一样。欢迎他们的一位代表告诉他：当轰炸还没停止的时候，救死扶伤、清理灾区的工作就开始了。意思是说：家里的人也像志愿军战士们在朝鲜战场上一样，都以忘我牺牲的精神在工作着，敌人的破坏阻止不了我们的建设。
    很快，他们就被送到休息的地方——一座风景优美的医院。护士们扶他们下车，把他们安置在充满阳光的温暖的病室里。为了让他们得到充分休息，恢复两天两夜乘车的疲劳，连剪手指甲这一点小事都不让他们自己做。护士们没有一个是闲着的。她们像是对待自己的亲兄弟一样，真诚、和善、体贴，而且干得那样称心乐意。
    祖国为了使他们恢复身体的健康和精神的健康所安排下的一切周到的、细致的布置，使他们深切地感到祖国的无比温暖。他们曾用整个生命拥抱祖国，宁冒生命的危险，他们也不愿和祖国分开。现在他们终于重新回到了两年多来日日夜夜所盼望着的祖国怀抱。谁也不能再叫他们离开她了。
