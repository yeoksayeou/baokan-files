Reader's Letters Excerpts:

	Resolutely Oppose Increasing Grain Processing Precision
	Reader Zhang Xiyang writes: For more than three years since liberation, due to the increasing economic prosperity and the gradual improvement of people's lives, many people demand that grain be more "refined," "whiter," and "better." Some grain management departments and public and private grain processing factories, in order to cater to this demand, disregard the state's call to promote conservation and ensure the nutritional components of grain, and blindly increase the precision of grain processing in order to seek high profits. For example, when processing medium-ripe rice, the Chongqing Grain Company reduced the rice yield of unpolished rice from 90 jin to 85.47 jin. They also mistakenly believe that although the product quantity has decreased by more than four jin, the local medium-grade rice only sells for 850 yuan per jin, while the processed high-grade refined rice can sell for more than 1,000 yuan per jin. It is calculated that each 100 jin of unpolished rice processed into high-grade refined rice can earn more than 10,000 yuan more than processing it into medium-grade rice. They only consider making more profit, and have not considered how much grain the state is wasting with this practice, and what impact it has on nutritional value. Taking Chongqing as an example, if the city's population averages one jin of rice per person per day, if they eat high-grade rice all year round compared to eating medium-grade rice all year round, they will lose 4.5 million jin of rice. This waste is really unnecessary and should be stopped immediately. It is hoped that all cadres of organs and people from all walks of life will pay attention to the nutritional components of food and correct the tendency to blindly pursue more refined and whiter rice and flour.

### 坚决反对提高粮食加工精度

专栏：读者来信摘要

    坚决反对提高粮食加工精度
    读者张锡羊来信：解放三年多来，由于经济日趋繁荣，人民生活逐渐好转，很多人对粮食的要求是愈“精”愈“白”愈“好”，而一些粮食管理部门和公、私营粮食加工厂，为了迎合这种要求，竟不顾国家提倡节约与保证粮食营养成份的号召，盲目提高粮食加工精度，以图厚利。如重庆市粮食公司在加工中熟米时，竟将碛米（糙米）出米成率由九十斤降低到八十五点四七斤。他们还错误地认为产品数量虽然降低了四斤多，但当地中等米每斤只售八百五十元，而加工成的上等精米每斤可卖到一千多元，计每百斤碛米如加工成上等精米比加工成中等米还多获利一万多元。他们光为了多获利，并没有考虑到这种做法浪费了国家多少粮食，在营养价值上有什么影响。就拿重庆市为例，如按全市人口平均每人每日吃米一斤，如全年全食上等米和全年全吃中等米比较，吃上等米就要损失大米四百五十万斤。这种浪费实在是不应该的，望即停止。并希望各机关干部和社会人士，注意食粮的营养成份，纠正盲目追求米面愈精愈白的偏向。
