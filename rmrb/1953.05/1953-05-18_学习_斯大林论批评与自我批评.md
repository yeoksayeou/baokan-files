Studying "Stalin on Criticism and Self-Criticism"
Zhou Jing

It is very helpful for us to frequently review the teachings of our most beloved teacher, Comrade Stalin, on criticism and self-criticism. This is because we still have many shortcomings in the matter of criticism and self-criticism; and Stalin’s teachings are precisely the weapons to help us overcome these shortcomings.

Stalin taught that criticism and self-criticism are "the foundation of the Bolshevik Party" and "one of the major forces driving us forward." He called those who dislike criticism "varnished" people. He said: "These 'varnished' communists have nothing in common with the spirit of our party and the spirit of Bolshevism."

The "Three-Anti" Movement and the nationwide struggle against bureaucracy, which was widely launched on the basis of the "Three-Anti" Movement, revealed many instances showing that "varnished" communists also exist in the leading organs of our Party and government at all levels. These people are accustomed to concealing evil and publicizing good, reporting good news but not bad. When they talk about achievements, they are articulate and very specific; when they talk about shortcomings, they are hesitant and very abstract; they often ignore the criticism from the masses, or seize on individual trivial issues in the criticism to overturn all correct criticisms. Even more, some people have completely lost their political sense of smell, violate the Party's policies, and neither accept the Party's criticism nor the criticism of the people; they treat the units they lead as independent kingdoms, violating laws and regulations, doing whatever they want, allowing others to only say good things and not bad things. If they achieve a little success in their work, they become arrogant and complacent, demanding that others loudly praise them; but when someone exposes their shortcomings, it is as if a festering sore on their head has been peeled open, and they become furious, suppressing, attacking, and retaliating against the critics. These people should draw the most painful lessons from the Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan incident, the Huang Yifeng incident, and the Wang Zhenhai incident. Facts have proven that anyone who adopts this wrong attitude towards criticism is leading themselves onto a dead end of opposition to the Party and the people.

Stalin explained the correct principles of criticism and self-criticism as follows: "We Bolsheviks criticize the whole world, and in Marx's words, we are people who turn the world upside down. If we give up self-criticism for the sake of the peace of mind of some comrades, then there will be no result other than ruining our great cause." He also said: "The responsibility of the Bolsheviks is not to cover up their mistakes, not to evade questions about their mistakes, as often happens here, but to sincerely and openly admit their mistakes, sincerely and openly formulate ways to correct these mistakes, and sincerely and openly correct their mistakes." He also said: "Let the Party, let the Bolsheviks, let all honest workers and laborers in our country expose the shortcomings in our work and the shortcomings in our construction, let them point out the ways to eliminate our shortcomings, so that there will be no more stagnation, mess, or corruption in our work and our construction, so that all our work and all our construction will improve day by day and go from success to success."

Stalin's teachings tell us that criticism is a necessary condition for promoting the progress of the Party and the success of the cause of national construction; criticism must be protected and supported, and any act of obstructing or suppressing criticism is not allowed.

The lack of regularity in criticism is a common shortcoming. Many people regard criticism as a means to cope with some political movement. These comrades, as Stalin said, "believe that self-criticism is a transient phenomenon, a fad that, like any other fad, will soon pass." Therefore, when a movement comes, they conduct some criticism, even crying bitterly in public. But as soon as the movement is over, they relapse into their old ways, throwing the Party's policies, the masses' criticism, and their own self-criticism to the winds. Stalin said: "These comrades are completely wrong. In fact, self-criticism is an integral and constantly used weapon in the arsenal of Bolshevism, a weapon inextricably linked with the very nature of Bolshevism and its revolutionary spirit."

Due to the infrequency of criticism, many comrades have not yet developed the habit of criticism and cannot withstand truly strict and sharp criticism. This is like a person who has lived in seclusion for a long time and does not come into contact with the fresh air of the outside world, who is easily susceptible to colds when exposed to a slight chill. It is obvious that those who cannot withstand the wind and waves cannot move forward.

We always expect to move forward continuously, and we always expect to continuously improve and develop our work. Precisely because of this, the following words of Stalin deserve to be engraved in our hearts forever:

"You must know that our development is not smooth sailing, rising steadily. No, comrades, there are still classes here, there are still various contradictions within our country, we have the past, we have the present and the future, and there are various contradictions between them, so we cannot move forward smoothly in the tide of life. Our progress is carried out in struggle, in the development of contradictions, in overcoming these contradictions, and in exposing and eliminating these contradictions.

"As long as classes still exist, we will never have a situation where we can say: Ah, thank God, everything is fine now. Comrades, we will never have this situation.

"There is always something dying in our lives. But the dying things do not want to die simply, but fight for their survival and cling to their declining cause.

"There is always something new growing in our lives. But the growing things do not grow up simply, but clamor, shout, and fight for their right to survive.

"The struggle between the new and the old, the struggle between the dying and the emerging - this is the basis of our development. If we do not openly and sincerely point out and expose the shortcomings and mistakes in our work as Bolsheviks should, we will cut off our own path forward. But we want to move forward. Precisely because we want to move forward, we should put forward sincere and revolutionary self-criticism as one of our most important tasks. Without doing so, we cannot move forward. Without doing so, we cannot develop."

Some people can accept certain criticisms from superiors, but not criticisms from the masses below. They appear to be sincerely convinced and readily admit their mistakes in the face of criticism and accusations from superiors; but when comrades below touch on their shortcomings, they fly into a rage and try every means to suppress criticism. Some people also demand perfect criticism, and if the criticism is not perfect, they do not accept it.

Stalin said: "This is incorrect. This is a dangerous mistake. As soon as you try to raise this requirement, you will block the mouths of thousands and tens of thousands of workers, worker correspondents, and rural correspondents who are willing to correct our shortcomings but are sometimes not good at expressing themselves correctly. This is a dead end, not self-criticism."

Stalin particularly taught us to always listen carefully to criticism from below. He said: "Even if the criticism only contains five to ten percent of the truth, then such criticism should also be welcomed, listened to carefully, and grasp the healthy core of it."

Obviously, we cannot be confused on these few basic issues. First, the cause we are engaged in is the cause of the people, which requires the full play of the revolutionary initiative and creativity of thousands of people, that is to say, to pool the wisdom and efforts of everyone in order to do a good job. The people have endless wisdom and strength, while the wisdom and strength of individuals are limited. Second, the revolution is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the construction of our country is advancing by leaps and bounds. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to overcome the large and small obstacles in the progress. Therefore, it is very necessary for the people to put forward criticism to us at any time and any place. Third, criticism itself is a means to improve ourselves and at the same time improve the ability of the people to manage and build the country. We should make full use of such a beneficial means to us.

The actual situation is also like this. Wherever criticism is carried out, the political responsibility of the masses is strong, and the work there is done better; wherever criticism cannot be carried out, the political responsibility of the masses is low, and the work there is poor, and there are many loopholes.

However, bottom-up criticism cannot be carried out smoothly everywhere. On the contrary, it will encounter obstacles everywhere. Comrade Malenkov said: "It is wrong to think that bottom-up criticism can be carried out automatically in a spontaneous way. Only when everyone who puts forward healthy criticism can be sure that he can get the support of our organization, and that the shortcomings he pointed out will be truly removed, can bottom-up criticism be carried out, grow, and expand." These words are very profound for us.

The main obstacle to carrying out criticism and self-criticism is bureaucracy in our leading organs, especially bureaucracy in our Party ranks. Stalin said: "Communist Party bureaucrats are the most dangerous kind of bureaucrats. Why? Because they use the title of Party member to cover up their bureaucracy."

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people, and everything we do is to serve the people." Bureaucracy, on the other hand, wants to be masters standing above the people. Chairman Mao said: "Give others the opportunity to speak," while bureaucracy does not give others the opportunity to speak, and regards the opinions of the masses as wind in the ears; Chairman Mao said: "Those who speak are not guilty, and those who hear should take warning," while bureaucracy regards those who speak as guilty and those who hear do not take warning. What do these styles have in common with the style of our Party and the style of the working class?

The experience of anti-bureaucracy has proved that the damage and harm caused by bureaucracy to our Party and the country are inestimable. In order to eliminate the poison of bureaucracy and attract hundreds of millions of people to carry out bottom-up criticism, Stalin said: "It is necessary to develop proletarian democracy in all mass organizations of the working class, and first of all within the Party itself." "There is no and cannot be any other way to combat this poison except to organize mass supervision from the bottom up in the Party and to cultivate democracy within the Party."

Of course, Stalin did not mean that there is no need for labor discipline when self-criticism is needed. He said: "This is not criticism, but a mockery of the working class." Self-criticism is needed "in order to consolidate labor discipline, in order to make labor discipline conscious labor discipline." Of course, Stalin did not mean that there is no need for leadership when there is self-criticism. He said: "This is not self-criticism, but shameful." Self-criticism is needed "in order to strengthen leadership, in order to turn leadership on paper and without prestige into living and truly prestigious leadership." Stalin said: "The purpose of our self-criticism is to cultivate Party spirit, consolidate Soviet power, improve our construction, strengthen our economic cadres, and arm the working class." "What we need is a self-criticism that raises the cultural level of the working class, develops its fighting spirit, consolidates its confidence in victory, increases its strength, and helps it become the true master of the country."

The above teachings of Comrade Stalin teach us that, in order to more smoothly advance the construction of our country, we must more widely and more frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, closely combine it with current work, resolutely oppose bureaucracy, so as to raise the awareness of the people of the whole country as masters of their own affairs, and strive to realize national industrialization.

    学习“斯大林论批评与自我批评”
    周静
    经常地温习我们最敬爱的导师斯大林同志关于批评与自我批评的教言，对我们是很有帮助的。这因为我们在批评与自我批评问题上，还存在着很多缺点；而斯大林的教言，正是帮助我们克服这些缺点的武器。
    斯大林教导说，批评与自我批评“是布尔什维克党底基础”，“是推动我们向前发展的重大力量之一”。他称一些讨厌批评的人为“涂了漆的”人。他说：“这些‘涂了漆的’共产党员与我们党底精神、与布尔什维主义底精神是毫无共同之处的。”
    “三反”运动和在“三反”基础上广泛展开的全国范围的反官僚主义斗争所揭发出来的许多事例说明，“涂了漆的”共产党员，在我们党和政府的各级领导机关中，也是存在着的。这些人习惯于隐恶扬善，报喜不报忧。他们说起成绩，头头是道，十分具体；谈到缺点，就吞吞吐吐，非常抽象；对于群众的批评，往往是置之不理，或抓住批评中的个别枝节问题推翻全部正确的批评。更有些人根本失去政治的嗅觉，违反党的政策，既不接受党的批评，也不接受人民群众的批评；他们把自己领导的单位当作独立王国，违法乱纪，为所欲为，只准别人说好，不准别人说坏。工作得稍有成绩，就骄傲自满，要求人家为他们大事鼓吹；但当有人揭发他们的缺点时，就像剥开了他们头上的烂疮疤，大发雷霆，对批评者进行压制、打击、报复。这些人应该在刘青山、张子善事件中，在黄逸峰事件中，在王振海事件中获得最沉痛的教训。事实证明，凡对批评采取这种错误态度的人，就等于把自己引上与党与人民相对立的死路。
    斯大林是这样说明批评与自我批评的正确原理的：“我们布尔什维克是批评全世界的，用马克思底话来讲，我们是翻天覆地的人，如果我们为了某些同志底安宁而放弃自我批评，——那末除了断送我们的伟大事业以外，就不会有任何结果”。又说：“布尔什维克底责任不是掩盖自己的错误，不是逃避有关自己错误的问题，如像我们这里所常有的情形一样，而是诚恳和公开地承认自己的错误，诚恳和公开地定出改正这些错误的办法，诚恳和公开地改正自己的错误。”又说：“让党、让布尔什维克、让我国一切诚实的工人和劳动分子来揭露我们工作中的缺点、我们建设中的缺点吧，让他们指出消灭我们缺点的途径，以便我们工作中和我们建设中不再有停滞、糟糕、腐败的现象，以便我们的全部工作、我们的全部建设一天天地改善并且从成功走到成功吧。”
    斯大林的教言告诉我们：批评是促进党的进步和国家建设事业成功的必要条件；批评必须受到保护支持，任何阻碍、压制批评的行为都是不能容许的。
    批评的经常性不够，是我们普遍存在的缺点。有许多人把批评当作应付某种政治运动的手段。这些同志，正如斯大林所说：“认为自我批评是转瞬过去的现象，是一种时髦品，它与普通任何时髦品一样一定很快就会过时的”。因此，他们在运动来到时，就进行一下批评，甚至当众痛哭流涕。但运动刚过，就旧病复发，把党的政策、群众的批评和自己的自我检讨一起扔到九霄云外。斯大林说：“这些同志是完全错误了。其实自我批评是布尔什维主义武库中不可分割的和经常运用的武器，这个武器与布尔什维主义底性质本身、与它的革命精神是不可分离地联系着的。”
    由于批评的不经常，许多同志至今还没有养成批评的习惯，经受不起真正严格的尖锐的批评。这情形，就像长久闭门幽居不接触外界新鲜空气的人，稍遇风寒就容易伤风感冒。显而易见，经不起风浪的人，是不能前进的。
    我们总是指望不断地前进，我们总是指望不断地改善和发展我们的工作。唯其这样，斯大林下述这些话就值得我们永远铭记在心：
    “要知道我们的发展并不是平平稳稳、一直上升地前进的。不，同志们，我们这里还有阶级存在着，我们国家内部还有各种矛盾，我们有过去的东西，我们有现在的东西和将来的东西，它们之间有各种矛盾，因此我们就不能在生活浪潮中一帆风顺地前进。我们的前进是在斗争中、在矛盾底发展中、在克服这些矛盾中、在揭露和消灭这些矛盾中进行的。
    “当阶级还存在着，我们决不会有这样的一种情况，竟致可以说：啊，谢天谢地，现在什么都好了。同志们，这种情况我们是决不会有的。
    “我们生活中总是有什么东西在消亡着。但是消亡的东西，不愿意简单地死去，而要为着自己的生存作斗争，坚持自己已经衰败的事业。
    “我们生活中总是有什么新东西在生长着。但是生长的东西，不是简单地生长起来的，而是喧嚷着，叫喊着，争取自己的生存权。
    “新东西和旧东西之间的斗争，垂死的东西和新生的东西之间的斗争，——这就是我们发展底基础。如果不像布尔什维克所应有的那样公开地、诚恳地指出和揭露我们工作中的缺点与错误，我们就会断绝自己前进的道路。但我们是想前进的。正因为我们想前进，所以我们应当提出诚恳的和革命的自我批评作为自己极重要的任务之一。不这样作，就不能前进。不这样作，就不能发展。”
    有些人，能接受上级的某些的批评，不能接受来自下面的群众的批评。他们在上级的批评指责面前，表现心悦诚服，一口承认错误；但当下面的同志一触动他的缺点，就暴跳如雷，千方百计地压制批评。也有些人，要求十全十美的批评，如果批评不是十全十美，就不接受。
    斯大林说：“这是不正确的。这是危险的错误。只要把这个要求试提出来，你们就会塞住成千成万愿意纠正我们的缺点但有时还不善于正确地表达自己意思的工人、工人通讯员、农村通讯员底口。这便是死路，而不是自我批评。”
    斯大林特别教导我们要经常地细心地倾听来自下面的批评。他说：“即令批评只包括着百分之五到百分之十的真理，那末就是这种批评也应该欢迎，细心地倾听，抓住其中健全的核心。”
    显然，我们在这几个基本问题上是不能糊涂的。第一，我们从事的事业是人民的事业，需要千千万万的人民群众充分发挥革命的积极性与创造性，也就是说要群策群力，才能做好。人民群众有无穷无尽的智慧和力量，而个人的智慧和力量则是有限的。第二，革命在一日千里地猛进，我们国家的建设事业在一日千里地猛进，因此，克服前进中的大小障碍是十分迫切需要的，因此，就十分需要人民群众随时随地对我们提出批评。第三，批评本身是提高我们自己，同时提高人民群众管理国家和建设国家能力的手段，像这样对我有益的手段，我们应该尽量地利用。
    实际的情况也正是这样。凡批评得到开展的地方，群众的政治责任感就强，那里的工作也就做得好些；凡批评展不开的地方，群众的政治责任感就低，那里的工作就差，漏洞就多。
    但是，自下而上的批评并不是到处都能顺利地展开的。恰恰相反，它却到处会碰到阻碍。马林科夫同志说：“以为自下而上的批评能够以自流的方式自动展开的看法，是错误的。只有在每一个提出健康的批评的人能够确实知道他可以得到我们组织的支持，确实知道他所指出的缺点会真正去掉的时候，自下而上的批评才能展开，才能生长和扩大。”这些话对我们是非常深刻的。
    开展批评与自我批评的最主要的障碍，是我们领导机关中的官僚主义，特别是在我们党的队伍里的官僚主义。斯大林说：“共产党员官僚主义分子是最危险的一种官僚主义分子。为什么呢？因为他是以党员底称号来掩饰自己的官僚主义。”
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。官僚主义则要做站在人民之上的老爷。毛主席说：“给别人以说话的机会”，官僚主义则不给别人以说话的机会，把人民群众的意见当作耳边风；毛主席说：“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，官僚主义则言者有罪，闻者不戒。这种作风与我们党的作风、工人阶级的作风有什么丝毫共同之点呢。
    反官僚主义的经验证明，官僚主义对我们党和国家所造成的损害及其危害性是无法估计的。为了肃清官僚主义的毒害，吸引千百万群众来进行从下而上的批评，斯大林说：“就必须在工人阶级一切群众组织里，而首先在党本身内部展开无产阶级的民主。”“除了组织党的自下而上的群众性监督以外，除了培植党内的民主以外，是没有而且也不能有任何其他的办法来反对这个毒害的。”
    当然，斯大林并不是说，需要自我批评，就无须有劳动纪律了。他说：“这不是批评，而是对工人阶级的嘲笑。”需要自我批评，“是为了巩固劳动纪律，为了使劳动纪律成为自觉的劳动纪律”。当然，斯大林也并不是说，有了自我批评，就不再需要领导了。他说：“这不是自我批评，而是可耻。”需要自我批评，“是为了加强领导，为了把纸上的和没有威信的领导变成有生命的和真正有威信的领导”。斯大林说：“我们的自我批评底目的是培植党性，巩固苏维埃政权，改善我们的建设，增强我们的经济干部，武装工人阶级。”“我们所需要的是这样的一种自我批评，这种自我批评提高工人阶级底文化程度，发挥它的战斗精神，巩固它的胜利信心，增加它的力量，帮助它成为真正的国家主人”。
    斯大林同志上述教言教导我们，为了更加顺利地把我国建设事业推向前进，必须更广泛地、更经常地开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，密切结合当前工作，坚决反对官僚主义，以便提高全国人民主人翁的自觉，为实现国家工业化而斗争。
