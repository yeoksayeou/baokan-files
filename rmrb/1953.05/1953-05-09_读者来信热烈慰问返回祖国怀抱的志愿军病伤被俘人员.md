Readers' Letters Warmly Greet the Returning Volunteer Army Wounded, Sick, and Captured Personnel
Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from readers in various regions expressing deep concern and warm greetings to the returning Volunteer Army wounded, sick, and captured personnel. We are now publishing excerpts from some of the letters below:

(I)
Zhou Zhiyong, a worker at the Beijing 211 Factory, sent a letter of慰问 (weìwèn - comfort) to the repatriated Volunteer Army wounded, sick, and captured personnel: All Chinese people are incredibly happy about your return to the embrace of the motherland. You participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to defend world peace and the security of the motherland. After unfortunately being captured, despite suffering persecution and murder by U.S. imperialism, you still fought resolutely against the enemy with a fiery heart of love for the motherland and an unwavering, noble will. We wholeheartedly care about your just struggle. Today, after tireless efforts by China and North Korea to strive for peace, and with the unanimous support of the people's democratic countries led by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, you have finally gained freedom. We extend our most sincere condolences and warmest congratulations to you.

Dear comrades, the people of the motherland deeply know that every drop of blood you shed was to defend our great motherland. With the united efforts of the people, our motherland has begun large-scale construction work and will become an even more beautiful and powerful country. Comrades, rest assured and recuperate in the embrace of the motherland. After you recover your health, let us work together for the cause of building the motherland.

(II)
The Communist Youth League Branch of the State and Legal Theory Teaching and Research Office of the Law Department of Renmin University of China sent a letter of慰问 (weìwèn - comfort) to the repatriated Volunteer Army wounded, sick, and captured personnel: Please accept our most sincere condolences. The people of the motherland are extremely happy about your return to the embrace of the motherland. In the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps, although you suffered inhuman torture and murder, and endured the difficulties of "screening" and "non-forcible repatriation," this could not destroy your strong will to return to the motherland. You have a flesh-and-blood relationship with the motherland, and your hearts are forever linked with the motherland. We feel deep resentment towards the torture and slaughter inflicted upon you by the enemy. Today you have returned to the motherland, and the motherland will warmly embrace you. We hope you will rest assured and recuperate, and recover your health soon.

(III)
Zhang Binru, Yang Weixiang, and six others from the North China People's Drama Troupe sent a letter of慰问 (weìwèn - comfort) to the repatriated Volunteer Army wounded, sick, and captured personnel: When we heard the news of your return home, we couldn't wait to see you, caress your wounds, and pay tribute to your spirit of perseverance in fighting against the enemy's cruel persecution. Dear comrades, the motherland that you defended with your blood is now undergoing large-scale construction. You will surely be infinitely happy to return to the embrace of the motherland and see the increasingly prosperous and powerful situation of the motherland. We earnestly hope that you will rest assured and recuperate, recover your health as soon as possible, participate in the great construction work of the motherland, and build the motherland more beautiful and stronger.

(IV)
All the students of Class B, Junior Grade 3, Girls' Department of Beijing No. 33 Middle School, sent a letter of慰问 (weìwèn - comfort) to the repatriated Volunteer Army wounded, sick, and captured personnel: You have left the evil prisons of U.S. imperialism and returned to the embrace of the motherland, and we extend our most sincere condolences to you. In the past, we saw in the newspapers that you fought unyieldingly to defend the honor of the motherland. Your spirit will always inspire us. We were very happy to hear the news of your repatriation. We are determined to raise our vigilance and continue to strengthen the struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, so that the captured Chinese and Korean soldiers who are still suffering in the living hell-like U.S. prisoner-of-war camps can also return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Finally, we hope you will rest assured and recuperate, and recover your health soon.
