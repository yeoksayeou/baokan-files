Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: According to reports from Kaesong by Wilfred Burchett of the London "Daily Worker" and Bécaud of the Paris "l'Humanité": Anyone who sees the mentally ill Korean POWs repatriated by the US side will not be surprised why the Korean-Chinese side insists on having full facilities to dispel the misgivings of the POWs who the US side claims do not wish to return home. The United States sent back one hundred and sixty-eight mental patients, of whom one hundred and forty-three are living in the hospital here. Lying in the wards are patients with expressionless faces and dull eyes, and heart-rending screams and hysterical laughter break the silence in the wards. They murmur, "Let me go home," "I want to go back to the North." Most of them still think they are in the hands of the Americans. When repatriated Lim Seng-ki (transliteration) was examined by a Korean doctor, he sarcastically said: "Are you going to ask me again? It's completely unnecessary. I'm not a detained civilian, I'm a prisoner of war, and I want to go to Pyongyang." Some people are angry with the nurses here, they shout: "Don't call me comrade. You want to stop me from going home, you are my enemy." Only a very few people have lucid moments. Kim Seng-tae (transliteration) is completely clear-headed at times, and he saw at least two hundred people go crazy in the No. 2 Busan Hospital camp due to forced "screening". He said that during the "screening" period from April to June last year, patients were beaten to death or injured every day. He himself was driven insane at that time. In June, he was transferred to Camp 71 - a place recognized as a "grave." During the continued "screening", the Americans beat him with rubber hoses. The Americans said, "You are mentally ill, do you feel pain?" Kim Seng-tae also remembers waking up in prison and not getting anything to eat for days.
From another repatriated person, I heard about Kim Seong-bo (transliteration), who was not repatriated. He belonged to the unit that captured the commander of the US 24th Division, Dean, and he was cruelly electrocuted to confess to killing Dean. He was tortured until he went mad, and then signed a confession saying that he himself killed Dean with a knife. When news came that Dean was still alive, Kim Seong-bo was taken out of the "war criminal" prison and sent to an ordinary POW camp.
A Korean nurse said to me: "They are becoming more and more lucid. You can hear them saying to each other: 'Why don't these devils beat us anymore? Why are they always smiling and kind to us now?'" The doctors here are convinced that most of them will recover their health. Among the mentally ill patients, about fifty-five will never fully recover. According to doctors and sane POWs, the number of people suffering from mental illness increased dramatically when the US side stepped up its "screening" from April to June last year. Doctors have not been able to obtain direct evidence from the patients, but can only learn some information from those who were close to them in the POW camps, so there are no complete statistics. But they said that most of the patients were obviously driven insane by the US side's cruel torture in order to prevent them from returning home - they all wanted to return home - and some people developed mental disorders after witnessing the massacres in the camps. Malnutrition is also a factor in causing mental disorders.

    大批战俘在美方残酷虐待下神经错乱
    【新华社二十二日讯】据伦敦“工人日报”记者魏宁顿和巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌自开城报道：凡是看到被美方遣返的患有精神病的朝鲜战俘的人，就不会感到奇怪，为什么朝中方面坚持要有充分的便利来解除美方所谓不愿回家的战俘的疑惧了。美国送回了一百六十八个精神病患者，其中有一百四十三个住在这里的医院中。病房内躺着面无表情、目光迟钝的病人，震人心弦的尖叫声和歇斯底里亚的笑声打破了病房中的寂静。他们喃喃地说：“让我回家”，“我要回到北边去”。我听到一个人从恶梦中醒来，他叫着：“我是朝鲜人。你就是打死我，我也要回家。”他们大多数还以为自己是在美国人手中。被遣返的林生基（译音）在朝鲜医生检查他时，讥讽地说：“你又要来问我了？这是完全不必要的。我不是被拘平民，我是战俘，我要到平壤去。”有的人对这里的护士发怒，他们叫道：“不要叫我同志。你想阻止我回家，你是我的敌人。”只有极少数的人有神志清醒的时刻，金生泰（译音）有些时期是完全头脑清楚的，他曾在釜山第二号医院营场看到至少有两百个人由于受到强迫“甄别”而发疯。他说，在去年四月到六月的“甄别”期间，每天都有病人被打死或打伤。他自己在那时被弄成精神错乱。六月间，他被移送到七十一号营场——被公认为“坟墓”的地方。在继续进行“甄别”期间，美国人用橡皮管打他。美国人说：“你有精神病，你觉到痛吗？”金生泰还记得，他在监狱中苏醒过来，好几天没有得到东西吃。
    从另一个被遣返人员那里，我听到没有被遣返的金性波（译音）的情况。他是属于俘掳美军第二十四师师长迪安的那个部队的，他受到残酷的电刑，要他承认杀害了迪安。他被折磨得发了疯，于是签字承认说他本人用刀子把迪安杀死。当消息传来说迪安仍然活着的时候，金性波从“战犯”监狱里被提出来，送到普通的战俘营场里。
    一个朝鲜护士对我说：“他们的神志越来越清醒了。你可以听到他们互相说：‘这些魔鬼为什么不打我们啦？现在他们为什么总是对我们笑容满面，和蔼可亲？’”这里的医生们坚信，他们大多数人一定能恢复健康。在精神病患者当中，约有五十五个人将永远不能完全恢复正常。据医生和神志正常的战俘说，在去年四月到六月，当美方加紧进行“甄别”时，患精神病的人大大增加。医生们由于无法从病人那里得到直接证据，而只能从那些在战俘营中时和他们接近的人那里知道一些情况，因此还没有完全的统计。但是他们说，大多数的病人显然都是由于美方为了阻止他们回家——他们都愿回家，残酷地拷打他们而弄得神经错乱的，还有一些人是由于亲眼看到营场中屠杀的情形而发生神经错乱的。营养不良也是引起神经错乱的一个因素。
