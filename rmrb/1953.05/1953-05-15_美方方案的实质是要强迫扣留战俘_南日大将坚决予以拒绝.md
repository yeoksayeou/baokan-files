Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 14th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation of the Korean and Chinese side released the following communique on May 14th:

The two sides' negotiation delegations held a meeting on May 14th.

At the meeting, our side's Chief Delegate General Nam Il succinctly analyzed the essence of the other side's May 13th proposal, pointing out that the other side's suggestion to so-called "release on the spot" immediately after the armistice the Korean prisoners of war who would not be directly repatriated in South Korea was direct forcible retention. Its insistence on "releasing on the spot" in South Korea the non-Korean prisoners of war who had not requested repatriation after being held by neutral nations for two months was also a disguised form of forcible retention. The other side tried every possible means to paralyze the entire Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and prevent it from effectively exercising its legitimate functions and added various unreasonable restrictions to the explanatory work of the prisoners' home countries to the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war. The basic policy contained in these main points of the other side's proposal was all for the purpose of forcibly retaining prisoners of war, and there was nothing in common with our side's May 7th proposal. Our side firmly rejects this proposal.

General Nam Il requested that the two sides' delegations quickly pass our side's proposal. The other side still insisted on its absurd claims at the meeting and wantonly slandered the neutral countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which should be invited by both sides, claiming that the majority of the neutral countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission might be manipulated by our side, therefore opposing our side's proposal that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission adopt the majority vote rule of procedure.

General Nam Il solemnly pointed out that the other side's unreasonable attitude was completely unhelpful to the armistice negotiations. The other side's slanderous remarks against the neutral countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission showed that the other side had no sincerity in enabling the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to effectively exercise its legitimate duties, exposing the other side's conspiracy to maintain its control and influence over the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in order to forcibly retain them.

General Nam Il finally pointed out that our side has put forward two fair, reasonable, and practical plans sufficient to immediately resolve the prisoner of war issue and achieve a Korean armistice. He requested the other side to reconsider its position, accept our side's plan, and realize the Korean armistice.

The two sides are scheduled to continue the two sides' delegation meeting at 11:00 a.m. on May 15th.

The full text of General Nam Il's main speech at the two sides' delegation meeting on May 14th is as follows:

"We have preliminarily studied your side's speech and proposal yesterday. Your proposal is absolutely unacceptable, and we firmly reject your proposal.

First of all, your proposal attempts to overturn the current basis of negotiations between the two sides. Since our side suggested that the repatriation of prisoners of war be carried out in two steps, and that the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice be transferred to neutral nations in order to achieve a just resolution of their repatriation issue, your side has expressed agreement with the principle of our side's suggestion more than once, that is, to transfer the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice to neutral nations. However, the proposal put forward by your side openly suggests that the Korean prisoners of war, who account for more than two-thirds of the total number of prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated after the armistice, be released on the spot. This not only contradicts the position repeatedly expressed by your side itself, but also undermines the current basis of negotiations and threatens the future of the entire negotiation. Your side knows very well that it is impossible for our side to consider your unreasonable request, but your side has put forward this fundamentally absurd suggestion, which makes people doubt whether your side has the sincerity to achieve a Korean armistice.

It is only because our side attempted to accommodate your side's premise of keeping the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea that our side suggested that a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission be formed by representatives of five neutral nations agreed upon by both sides, and that its member states dispatch an equal number of armed forces to Korea to guard the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war and stipulate that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should resolve disputes by a majority vote. Our suggestion is obviously to make the Repatriation Commission an agency capable of exercising its legitimate functions and resolving problems quickly. You claim to accept our suggestion in principle, but in the specific arrangements, you make various restrictions under the pretext of administrative difficulties that cannot be a reason at all, paralyzing the organization itself and in effect canceling our suggestion to establish a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Article 5 of your plan stipulates that the troops of the detaining side withdraw only two kilometers from the prisoner of war camp, placing the subsidiary bodies and staff of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission under your military control. Articles 6 and 16 of your plan openly point this out, and therefore stipulate that neutral India must request the detaining side to provide administrative and security forces and provide unarmed personnel to work in the prisoner of war camps. Your proposal also stipulates that only one neutral country provides arms, and the remaining neutral countries have only one representative, and their staff and assistants shall not exceed ten. And the five neutral countries must reach a unanimous agreement on all issues other than procedures. These unreasonable regulations threaten the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, placing it under your military control so that it cannot exercise its functions, and attempt to force the neutral nations to assist your forcible retention of our captured personnel. This is what our side firmly cannot agree to.

Regarding the explanation by one party to the prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, there should be full freedom and convenience, and this freedom and convenience should be specifically arranged by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is beyond reproach. You claim to agree with our suggestion, but in the specific arrangements, you deprive the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of its due legitimate functions, and place various unreasonable restrictions on the explanatory work of the relevant party, so that the relevant party cannot obtain the due freedom and convenience to carry out the explanation. The purpose of your setting up these restrictions like a dragnet is to prevent prisoners of war from returning to their hometowns, which is completely unreasonable, and our side firmly cannot agree to it.

Our side suggests that if after a reasonable period of four months, there are still prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the issue of their handling should be submitted to a political conference for resolution. We have repeatedly explained the rationality of our side's insistence on this proposition, and your side cannot offer any tenable reasons for opposition. However, your proposal suggests that after two months of custody by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, if there are still prisoners of war who have not dispelled their fears and dare not return home, they will be so-called 'released on the spot'. This is a disguised form of forcible retention, and our side firmly cannot agree to it. Our side firmly believes that this issue is part of the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and should be submitted to a political conference for resolution.

Your proposal also puts forward some specific details of the regulations, although these regulations are not without usable components, they are subordinate to the above-mentioned main issues. Your suggestions on these major issues attempt to overturn the entire basis of negotiation, which will cause more than two-thirds of our non-directly repatriated captured personnel to be directly forcibly retained in the name of on-the-spot release after the armistice; the remaining non-directly repatriated captured personnel of our side are handed over to a neutral country receiving organization that cannot effectively exercise its legitimate functions for custody, and the relevant parties cannot have sufficient freedom and convenience to explain to them, therefore, the fears they have accumulated in long-term detention cannot be guaranteed to be eliminated, and after an unreasonable period of two months, those who have not dispelled their fears and have not yet requested repatriation will be forcibly retained under the name of on-the-spot release. Your proposal is such a forcible retention plan, this is the essence of your plan, and it has nothing in common with our eight-point plan except for some formal similarities. We firmly reject this proposal, and reserve the right to further comprehensively refute this proposal.

It must be pointed out that our side's suggestion to divide the repatriation of prisoners of war into two steps, and to hand over the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, in order to seek a fair resolution of their repatriation issue, is a universally recognized fair and reasonable plan. We request that the two sides' delegation meeting quickly adopt our side's plan so that we can immediately enter into the agreement of the details and realize the Korean armistice that the world is eager for."

### 美方方案的实质是要强迫扣留战俘  南日大将坚决予以拒绝

    美方方案的实质是要强迫扣留战俘
    南日大将坚决予以拒绝
    【新华社开城十四日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月十四日发表公报如下：
    双方谈判代表团五月十四日举行会议。
    会上我方首席代表南日大将扼要分析了对方五月十三日方案的实质，指出：对方建议将不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘，在停战后立即在南朝鲜予以所谓“就地释放”，就是直接的强迫扣留。其主张将交由中立国看管两个月后，尚未请求遣返的非朝鲜籍战俘，也要在南朝鲜予以“就地释放”，同样是变相的强迫扣留。对方想尽办法使整个中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪而无法有效行使其合法职权，又对战俘所属国家向不直接遣返的战俘的解释工作，加上种种无理的限制。对方方案的这些主要之点，所包含的基本方针，都是为了强迫扣留战俘的一个目的，和我方五月七日方案，没有任何相同之处。我方坚决拒绝这个方案。
    南日大将要求双方代表团迅速通过我方方案。对方在会上仍然坚持其荒谬主张，并肆意诬蔑应为双方同意邀请的中立国遣返委员会的各中立国家，声称中立国遣返委员会的多数中立国家，可能为我方所操纵，因此反对我方所提出的中立国遣返委员会采用多数票决的议事规则的建议。
    南日大将严正指出，对方这种无理的态度完全无助于停战谈判。对方对于中立国遣返委员会的各中立国家的诬蔑性发言，显示对方没有诚意使中立国遣返委员会得以有效行使其合法职责，暴露了对方企图保持其对不直接遣返的战俘的控制和影响，以便强迫扣留他们的阴谋。
    南日大将最后指出：我方已经提出了两个足以立即解决战俘问题，实现朝鲜停战的公正合理与实际的方案，要求对方重新考虑其立场，接受我方方案，实现朝鲜停战。
    双方定于五月十五日上午十一时继续举行双方代表团大会。
    南日大将在五月十四日双方代表团大会上的主要发言全文如下：
    “我们初步地研究了你方昨天的发言和方案，你们的这个方案是绝对不能接受的，我们坚决拒绝你们的这个方案。
    首先，你们的这个方案企图推翻目前双方谈判的基础。自从我方建议将战俘的遣返分成两个步骤来进行，将停战后不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国以便对他们的遣返问题取得公正的解决；先后你方曾不止一次表示同意我方建议的原则，即将停战后不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国。但你方提出的方案，却公然建议将停战后暂不直接遣返的占总数三分之二以上的朝鲜籍战俘就地释放。这不仅和你方自己所一再表示的立场互相矛盾，而且破坏了目前谈判的基础，威胁整个谈判前途。你方明知道我方决不可能考虑你方这个无理要求，但你方竟然提出这个根本荒谬的建议，这就使人怀疑你方究竟有无获致朝鲜停战的诚意。
    只是由于我方试图迁就你方将不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜的前提，我方才建议：由双方同意的五个中立国家的代表组成中立国遣返委员会，并由其成员国派遣同等数目的武装力量来朝鲜看管不直接遣返的战俘并规定中立国遣返委员会遇有争执时由多数票决。我们这样建议，显然是为了要使遣返委员会成为一个能够行使合法职权并迅速解决问题的机构。你们声称原则上接受我方这一建议，但在具体安排上却以根本不能成为理由的行政困难为借口，提出种种限制，使这个组织本身陷于瘫痪，在实际上取消了我方所提出的设立中立国遣返委员会的建议。你方方案第五款规定拘留一方的军队，从战俘营只撤退两公里，使中立国遣返委员会的附属机构及其工作人员处于你方的军事控制之下。你方方案第六款与第十六款，公然指明了这一点，并因此规定中立国印度得向拘留一方要求提供行政和保安部队，提供非武装人员在战俘营内工作。你方提案又规定只有一个中立国家提供武装，其余中立国家只有一名代表，其参谋、助理人员不得超过十人。而五个中立国对程序以外的一切问题，必须取得一致同意。这些不合理的规定，就威胁中立国遣返委员会使之在你方军事控制之下不能行使职权，而企图迫使中立国来协助你方强迫扣留我方被俘人员。这是我方所坚决不能同意的。
    有关一方向中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘进行解释，应有充分的自由与便利，而这种自由与便利应由中立国遣返委员会来进行具体安排，这是无可非议的。你方声称同意我方这个建议，但在具体安排上却剥夺中立国遣返委员会应有的合法职权，对有关一方的解释工作多方加以层层的无理的限制，使有关一方不能获得应有的自由与便利来进行解释。你方设下这些天罗地网似的限制，其目的全在使战俘不得返回家乡，这是完全没有道理的，我方坚决不能同意。
    我方建议：如果在四个月的合理期限后，仍有在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘，关于他们的处理问题，应该提交政治会议解决。我们已经反复地说明了我方所坚持的这一主张的合理性，你方提不出任何站得住的反对理由。但你方方案却建议在中立国遣返委员会进行看管的两个月后，如仍有疑惧未消不敢回家的战俘，即行所谓‘就地释放’。这是一种变相的强迫扣留，我方坚决不能同意。我方坚决认为这个问题是和平解决朝鲜问题的一部分，应该提交政治会议解决。
    你方方案还提出了一些具体细节的规定，这些规定虽然不是没有可以采用的成份，但它们是从属于上述主要问题的。你们在这些主要问题上的建议，企图推翻整个谈判基础，它将使三分之二以上的我方不直接遣返的被俘人员，在停战后即行就地释放的名义下直接地被强迫扣留；其余的不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，交给一个无法有效行使其合法职权的中立国收容组织看管，有关一方不能有充分的自由与便利向他们进行解释，因之，他们在长期拘留中所积累起来的疑惧亦不能保证得以消除，而在两个月的不合理的期限之后，其疑惧未消尚未请求遣返者，又将在就地释放的名义之下遭受强迫扣留。你方方案就是这样一个强迫扣留的方案，这就是你们方案的实质，它和我方的八点方案除去个别形式相似而外，没有任何相同之处。我们坚决拒绝这个方案，同时并保留权利对这一个方案进行进一步的全面的驳斥。
    必须指出：我方建议将战俘的遣返分成两个步骤进行，将不直接遣返的战俘交由中立国遣返委员会看管，以便对他们的遣返问题求得公正解决的八点具体实施方案，是举世公认为公平合理的方案。我们要求双方代表团大会迅速通过我方这一方案，以便立即进入细节安排的商定，实现举世渴望的朝鲜停战。”
