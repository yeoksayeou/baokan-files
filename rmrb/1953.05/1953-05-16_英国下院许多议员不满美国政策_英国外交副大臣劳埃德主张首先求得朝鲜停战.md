Xinhua News Agency, London, May 14th: TASS, London, May 14th: From the speeches made by Conservative and Labour backbenchers following Churchill's speech during the House of Commons foreign affairs debate on May 11th, it is clear that they are increasingly resentful of various aspects of U.S. policy. Conservative MPs are particularly dissatisfied with the U.S. stance on the Egyptian issue.

According to the official parliamentary report, Labour MP John Hynd criticized the U.S. stance in the Panmunjom armistice negotiations, saying: "We do not fully understand the aggressive tone used by General Harrison just when the Chinese were about to make the real concessions we had hoped for—a tone that is becoming increasingly aggressive.

The fact is: there are many Americans, even many in the U.S. government, who are unwilling to end the war in the Far East at this time."

Hynd continued: "Chiang Kai-shek personally, and those in Taiwan who support him, very much want the war to continue, because it is their only possible hope of salvation... Chiang Kai-shek is being supported by very important people in the United States, including people in the government."

Hynd said: The situation is that there are some very powerful people in the United States who very much hope that the Panmunjom negotiations will not succeed.

Referring to the German question, Labour MP Michael Foot attacked Churchill for praising Adenauer. He said: "Apparently, our attitude towards Germany has not changed at all because of the changes that have taken place in Russia in recent weeks. Despite the new possibility of holding a four-power conference, we are single-mindedly implementing the European Defence Community Treaty, single-mindedly implementing Western defense plans, as if nothing has changed or moved. This is a hopeless attitude."

Labour MP Geoffrey Bing warned the United Nations not to interfere in the Indochina War.

Bing said that if Britain supported a policy of intervention in this war—which is considered a war of liberation in India and Indonesia—then nothing could divide the Commonwealth more fatally.

Labour MP Mrs. Castle said: Churchill's statement that although we are willing to be friendly with Soviet Russia, we are still determined not to waver in our obligations to Adenauer, is a plan that makes German unification impossible.

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: London dispatch: According to British Information Services, British Deputy Foreign Secretary Lloyd replied to questions raised by members of parliament during the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons on May 12th.

Lloyd said, "I think the House almost unanimously agrees that the first step should be an armistice in Korea, to stop this war that has cost so many lives and brought disaster to so many people, to stop this war that could escalate, and to continue to push forward the current promising developments."

Lloyd mentioned the Korean-Chinese side's eight-point new proposal regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war after the armistice, pointing out that it stipulates that prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice should be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and given the opportunity to explain to prisoners of war who are afraid to go home, guaranteeing their safe return home, and said, "All of these are acceptable."

On the other hand, Lloyd said that the British government still maintains that on the final disposition of prisoners of war, if the political conference fails to reach an agreement on the repatriation issue within thirty days, the responsibility for resolving this issue should be handed over to the "entire United Nations." That is to say, to the side waging war in the Korean War. At the same time, Lloyd used technical issues such as language as a reason to emphasize the "obstacles and difficulties" of sending armed forces from five neutral countries to ensure that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the power to carry out its legitimate duties and responsibilities, but he could not provide a definite and effective answer to how to ensure that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has this power and how to ensure that prisoners of war are completely free from the military control of the detaining party.

### 英国下院许多议员不满美国政策  英国外交副大臣劳埃德主张首先求得朝鲜停战

    英国下院许多议员不满美国政策
    英国外交副大臣劳埃德主张首先求得朝鲜停战
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社伦敦十四日讯：从保守党和工党后席议员继邱吉尔于五月十一日在下院外交事务辩论中发表演说后所发表的演说中，可以明显看出他们对于美国政策的各个方面越来越感到愤慨。保守党议员对于美国在埃及问题上所持的态度特别不满。
    据议会正式报告说，工党议员约翰·辛德抨击美国在板门店停战谈判中所持的态度说：“我们完全不了解哈利逊将军就在中国人即将作我们所希望的真正的让步的时候所使用的咄咄逼人的语气——这种语气正越来越咄咄逼人。
    事实是：有许多美国人、甚至有许多美国政府人士，不愿意在这个时候结束远东的战争。”
    辛德继续说：“蒋介石个人以及台湾的支持他的人很希望战争继续下去，因为这是他们得救的唯一可能的希望……蒋介石正得到美国的非常重要的人士的支持，包括政府方面人士在内。”
    辛德说：情况是美国有些势力很大的人很希望板门店谈判不能成功。
    谈到德国问题，工党议员迈克尔·福特抨击邱吉尔推崇阿登纳。他说：“显然，我们对德国的态度一点也没有因为最近几个星期在俄国所发生的改变而有所改变。尽管有了举行四国会议的新的可能性，我们一劲地执行欧洲防务集团条约、一劲地执行西方防御计划，就好像没有什么改变或变动一样。这是一种毫无希望的态度。”
    工党议员乔弗雷·宾恩警告联合国不要干涉印度支那战争。
    宾恩说，假如英国支持干涉这个战争——在印度和印度尼西亚被认为是解放战争——的政策的话，那么没有再比这更致命地分裂英联邦的了。
    工党议员卡斯尔夫人说：邱吉尔说尽管我们愿意与苏俄友好，我们仍决意不动摇我们向阿登纳所承担的义务，这种说法是使德国统一成为不可能的一种方案。
     【新华社十五日讯】伦敦消息：据英国新闻处消息，英国外交副大臣劳埃德五月十二日在下院进行外交辩论时，答复议员们提出的问题。
    劳埃德说，“我觉得下院几乎全部同意，第一个步骤应该是在朝鲜停战，把这场丧失了这么多生命并给这么多人带来灾难的战争停下来，把这场可能扩大的战争停下来，并且把目前有希望的发展情况继续不断地推进。”
    劳埃德提到朝中方面关于停战后遣返战俘的八点新建议，指出其中规定了停战后不直接遣返的战俘应该交给中立国遣返委员会，有机会向害怕回家的战俘进行解释工作，保证他们回家的安全，并说，“所有这些都是可以被接受的”。
    另一方面，劳埃德说，英国政府在战俘的最后处理上仍主张，政治会议如未能在三十天内就遣返问题达成协议，就把解决这个问题的责任交给“整个联合国”。这就是说，交给在朝鲜战争中进行战争的一方。同时，劳埃德又以语言这类的技术问题为理由，来对五个中立国派遣武装以保证中立国遣返委员会有权力执行其合法职务和责任一事强调其“障碍和困难”，但是他对于如何保证中立国遣返委员会有此权力，并如何保证战俘完全脱离拘留一方的军事控制，却提不出确切有效的答复。
