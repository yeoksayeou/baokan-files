Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 19th: After conducting a "fact-finding tour" of Middle Eastern countries, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is scheduled to arrive in India on the 20th to conduct activities. According to the United States International News Service, Washington's "diplomatic observers" believe that Dulles' visit to India during his "investigation" tour of the Middle East and South Asia "will be the real key."

However, before Dulles even set foot on Indian soil, he was met with widespread and fierce protests from all classes of people and the press in India. The Politburo of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on May 12, calling on all peace-loving and war-hating people in India to organize huge protest movements when Dulles arrives in India.

The statement pointed out: Dulles' purpose is to launch another war on Asian soil, making Asians fight Asians. We should stand up and declare that Asians will not become pawns of warmongers to profit them. On May 15, the Delhi Committee of the Communist Party of India organized a rally in New Delhi to protest Dulles' upcoming visit. Syed Ahmed, a member of the Indian National Congress, also participated in the rally. He said at the meeting: "We cannot allow American warmongers like Dulles to instigate Asians to massacre Asians." He added: "Dulles' visit to India is very harmful to India's freedom and Asian peace." Hiren Mukerjee, Deputy Leader of the Communist Parliamentary Group of India, stressed at the meeting: "We will not allow the United States to launch a world war. The Indian people must not tolerate the wars being waged in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya."

Many peace conferences held throughout India, as well as mass organizations such as the All-India Youth League, the Bengal Peasants' Association, and the Bengal Provincial Students' Federation, have all passed resolutions or issued statements opposing Dulles' visit to India.

Many Indian newspapers have also unanimously protested Dulles' upcoming visit to India. The English-language newspaper "Blitz Weekly," published in Bombay, said in an editorial entitled "Get Out of Asia, Dulles!": "We hate your propositions and politics. Dulles - believe us, there is no more unwelcome guest in our country than you." The newspaper added: "The Indian people cannot forget Dulles' visit to Korea on June 17, 1950, and soon after, on June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out."

The "Crossroads Weekly" published an editorial entitled "Down with America's War Policy," saying: Just as the American negotiators are obstructing the signing of the armistice agreement in Panmunjom, we, the Indian people, want to tell Dulles clearly that India will never tolerate America's current war policy.

The Bengali daily "Freedom Daily" and the Urdu daily "New Age Daily" have also published editorials protesting Dulles' visit to India.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Beirut dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' current activities in the Middle East continue to be fiercely opposed by the people of Middle Eastern countries.

After making "fact-finding tours" to Egypt and Israel, Dulles visited Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon successively on the 14th, 15th, and 16th. On the day Dulles arrived in Amman, the capital of Transjordan, many leaflets appeared there with slogans such as "Oppose the Middle East Command" and "Dulles, get back to Washington."

People from all walks of life in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, expressed their opposition to Dulles' conspiratorial activities in Lebanon by holding large-scale strikes, demonstrations, marches, and mass rallies. They held signs during the marches with slogans such as "Down with the Joint Defense Pact." United Press International revealed that Dulles' arrival in Beirut was delayed by an hour and a half due to panic over the demonstrations by the Lebanese people.

    印度各阶层人民抗议杜勒斯访问印度
    外约旦和黎巴嫩的人民要杜勒斯滚回华盛顿去
    【新华社新德里十九日电】美国国务卿杜勒斯在到中东各国进行了“调查事实旅行”之后，预定在二十日到印度进行活动。据美国国际新闻社透露，华盛顿的“外交观察家”认为：在杜勒斯的中东和南亚的“调查”旅行中，他对印度的访问“将是真正的关键”。
    但是，杜勒斯还没有走进印度的国土，就已遭到印度各阶层人民和舆论界普遍猛烈的抗议。印度共产党政治局在五月十二日发表一项声明，号召印度一切爱好和平、仇恨战争的人们在杜勒斯到达印度的时候，组织巨大的抗议运动。
    声明指出：杜勒斯来的目的是为了在亚洲土地上发动另一次战争，使亚洲人打亚洲人。我们应该站起来声明，亚洲人不会成为战争贩子们的走卒来替他们谋利。五月十五日，印度共产党德里委员会在新德里组织了集会，抗议杜勒斯即将来到的访问。印度国会国大党议员赛义德·艾哈迈德也参加了这个集会，他在会上说：“我们不能允许像杜勒斯这样的美国战争贩子来唆使亚洲人屠杀亚洲人。”他又说：“杜勒斯到印度来，对于印度的自由和亚洲的和平，有很大的妨害。”印度国会共产党议员团副领袖希伦·慕克吉在会上强调指出：“我们不会容许美国发动世界战争。印度人民决不能容忍正在朝鲜、越南和马来亚等地进行的战争。”
    在印度各地举行的许多和平大会以及全印青年联盟、孟加拉农民协会、孟加拉省学生联合会等群众团体，都通过决议或发表声明，反对杜勒斯到印度访问。
    许多印度报纸也一致抗议杜勒斯即将进行的对印度的访问。在孟买出版的英文报纸“闪电周报”在一篇题为“离开亚洲罢，杜勒斯！”的社论里说：“我们很讨厌你的主张和政治手段。杜勒斯——请你相信，到我国来的客人中再没有比你更不受欢迎的人了。”这个报纸又说：“印度人民不能忘记杜勒斯在一九五○年六月十七日访问朝鲜，而不久之后，在一九五○年六月二十五日，朝鲜就爆发战争的事情。”
    “十字路周报”以“打倒美国的战争政策”为题发表的社论中说：正当美国的谈判代表在板门店阻碍签订停战协定时，我们印度人民要明明白白地告诉杜勒斯，印度绝不能容忍美国目前的战争政策。
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”以及乌尔都文日报“新世纪报”，也都发表社论抗议杜勒斯访问印度。
    【新华社十九日讯】贝鲁特消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯目前在中东进行的活动，继续受到中东国家人民的激烈反对。
    杜勒斯在到埃及和以色列作了“调查事实旅行”之后，于十四日、十五日、十六日先后到外约旦、叙利亚和黎巴嫩活动。在杜勒斯到达外约旦首都安曼的一天，那里出现了许多传单，传单上写着反对“中东司令部”、要杜勒斯滚回华盛顿去等口号。
    黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特各阶层人民用举行大规模罢工、示威游行、群众集会等方式，表示反对杜勒斯到黎巴嫩进行阴谋活动。他们在游行时举着的标语牌上写着“打倒共同防御公约”等口号。合众社透露，由于对黎巴嫩人民的示威游行感到恐慌，杜勒斯到达贝鲁特的时间延迟了一个半小时。
