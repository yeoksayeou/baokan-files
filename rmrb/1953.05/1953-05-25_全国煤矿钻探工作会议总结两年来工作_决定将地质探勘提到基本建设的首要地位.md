The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the National Coal Miners' Union of China jointly convened the National Coal Mine Drilling Work Conference in the Fuxin Mining Area of Northeast China from April 11th to 20th. The conference shared advanced experiences in coal mine drilling work over the past two years, criticized the past disregard for drilling quality and the phenomenon of lack of responsibility in the work. It was clearly proposed that geological exploration must be placed at the forefront of coal mine capital construction in the future.

In recent years, China's coal mine geological exploration work has developed greatly. More than 5,000 workers and technical cadres have been trained, a large number of drilling rigs have been added, and more than 280,000 meters of drilling tasks have been completed, providing important conditions for China's coal mine construction. However, because this is a new work, there is a lack of experience in all aspects, and leaders at all levels have insufficient understanding of the importance of geological exploration in coal mine capital construction. As a result, the organization is unsound, the institution is large, the grass-roots leadership is weak, there is a lack of various responsibility systems, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the work is very serious. No one checks the core sampling rate or on-site records, the quality of drilling work is very poor, and there are many accidents. Shuangyashan, Fengfeng, Xinwen and other mines have lost entire layers of coal during drilling. A certain drilling rig in Jingxi lost its original records, and the core and coal core sampling rates did not meet national requirements. In the first quarter of this year, the rock core sampling rate was only 52%, and the coal core sampling rate was only 19%. No attention is paid to the storage of cores. Not enough attention is paid to the determination of hydrology. Much of the geological data produced under the above circumstances is inaccurate, which leads to many errors in the design of the mine. Secondly, due to frequent accidents, pure drilling time is short, and drilling efficiency is low, failing to meet the needs of mine design. The Tongshun well in Fengfeng Mine began to be renovated in 1951, but it has not been possible to design and construct it due to the lack of geological data. New construction projects in Didao, Chengzihe and other mines have been delayed due to the lack of geological data.

In order to rapidly change the serious situation in which geological exploration work lags behind the needs of coal mine development and to make geological exploration work adapt to the needs of national economic construction, the conference proposed that geological exploration must be placed in the forefront of capital construction and play its pioneering role. The guiding principle for this year is: strengthen technical management, establish a responsibility system, and complete the tasks assigned by the state on the basis of ensuring quality. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the political work among drilling workers so that they understand the glory and importance of geological exploration tasks. Establish a construction site management committee, and regularly convene employee representative meetings to fully promote democracy and solve problems such as drilling tasks or wage rewards. The organization should be under unified leadership, with the Geological Exploration Bureau directly leading the drilling teams, and equipped with capable machine operators, team leaders, and recorders to strengthen grass-roots forces. Implement the responsibility system, establish a series of responsibility systems such as quality and technical management, to ensure that each level is responsible, each has its own special responsibility, and a clear division of labor is made. The conference also required that on this basis in the future, the pure drilling time should be increased to no less than 35% in the Northeast and no less than 30% in the inland areas. In terms of quality, the rock core sampling rate should reach more than 75%, and the coal core sampling rate should be no less than 50%. In terms of efficiency, each drilling rig should reach 1,800 meters per year in the Northeast, 1,500 meters per year in the inland (excluding the Northwest and Southwest), and 1,000 meters in the Northwest and Southwest.

The conference also exchanged advanced experiences from various drilling teams, such as Gao Jianming's soft rock sampling tube (which can prevent coal core from falling off), Jixi's oblique drilling, the Yang Yuzhong team in Datong not having an accident for 304 days, and Yingcheng and Jixi improving quality. Soviet expert Aliberklinov gave a report on drilling issues at the meeting. The conference pointed out that it is necessary to fully promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the successful experience of various drilling teams to improve the level of coal mine drilling work. After careful consideration, representatives from various regions have formulated specific plans for promoting advanced experience and improving work. In addition, the meeting also discussed issues such as improving working conditions, improving labor protection, establishing a learning system, and enlivening recreational activities on the drilling site under possible conditions.

    全国煤矿钻探工作会议总结两年来工作
    决定将地质探勘提到基本建设的首要地位
    中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局和中国煤矿工会全国委员会，四月十一日到二十日在东北阜新矿区联合召开了全国煤矿钻探工作会议。会上交流了两年来煤矿钻探工作中的先进经验，批判了过去不重视钻探质量的思想与工作中的无人负责现象，明确提出今后必须将地质探勘工作放在煤矿基本建设的首要地位。
    我国煤矿地质探勘工作，几年来已有很大的发展，培养了五千余名工人和技术干部，增加了大量钻机，完成了二十八万余公尺的钻探任务，为我国煤矿建设提供了重要条件。但由于这是一个新的工作，各方面经验缺乏，各级领导对于地质探勘工作在煤矿基本建设中的重要性认识不足，因而组织不健全，机构庞大，基层领导薄弱，缺乏各种责任制，工作中的无人负责现象十分严重。煤芯采取率、现场记录都无人检查，钻探工作质量很坏，事故极多。双鸭、峰峰、新汶等矿都打丢过整层的煤。京西某钻机丢掉了原始记录，岩芯与煤芯的采取率都达不到国家的要求，今年第一季度岩芯采取率仅达百分之五十二，煤芯采取率仅达百分之十九。岩芯不注意保管。水文的测定也注意得很不够。在上述情况下做出来的地质资料，有许多就很不准确，这样就使矿井的设计也随着发生许多错误。其次，因事故频繁，纯钻进时间少，钻进效率不高，供不上矿井设计的需要。峰峰矿通顺井一九五一年开始投资改建，至今因缺乏地质资料而不能设计和施工。滴道、城子河等矿新建工程因无地质资料而延缓了工程进度。
    为了迅速改变地质探勘工作落后于煤矿发展需要的严重状况，使地质探勘工作适应国家经济建设的需要，会上提出必须将地质探勘放在基本建设的首要地位，发挥其先锋作用。今年的方针是：加强技术管理、建立责任制，在保证质量的基础上完成国家给予的任务。首先要加强钻探工作者中的政治工作，使他们了解到地质探勘任务的光荣与重要。建立工地管理委员会，并经常召开职工代表会议，充分发扬民主，解决钻探任务或工资奖励等问题。在组织上统一领导，由地质勘探局直接领导各钻探队，配备能力强的机长、班长和记录员，以充实基层力量。贯彻责任制，建立质量、技术管理等一系列的责任制，做到层层负责，各有专责，明确分工。会议并要求今后在此基础上，增加纯钻进时间，东北不低于百分之三十五，关内不低于百分之三十。质量方面岩芯采取率达到百分之七十五以上，煤芯采取率不低于百分之五十。效率方面，东北每年每台钻机要达到一千八百公尺，关内（西北、西南除外）每年每台钻机要达到一千五百公尺，西北和西南要达到一千公尺。
    会上又交流了各钻探队的先进经验，如高见明创造的软岩采取管（能防止煤芯脱落）、鸡西的打斜眼、大同杨玉忠小组三百零四天未出事故、营城、鸡西提高质量等等的经验。苏联专家阿利伯克利诺夫在会上作了关于钻探问题的报告。会议指出必须全力推广苏联先进经验与各钻探队成功的经验，以提高煤矿钻探工作的水平。各地代表经过慎重考虑，都订出了推广先进经验，改进工作的具体计划。此外，会议还讨论了在可能条件下改善劳动条件、改进劳动保护、建立学习制度、活跃钻场文娱生活等问题。
