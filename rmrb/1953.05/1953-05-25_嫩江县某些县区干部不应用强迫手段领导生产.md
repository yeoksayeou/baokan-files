    Certain County and District Cadres in Nenjiang County Should Not Use Coercive Means to Lead Production

    A letter from Sun Wanqing, a farmer in Hesheng Village, Seventh District, Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province: I would like to talk to you about a problem in production. After learning from the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience, the enthusiasm of the folks in our county is very high. However, in early April, county and district cadres went to the countryside to "mobilize" the folks to plow and sow wheat. The folks in our village said: The weather is so cold, the land hasn't thawed, how can we sow? The cadres forced us to plow on the 7th. As a result, the land couldn't be turned over, and the sowing wasn't good; four plowshares were broken, and one plow handle was damaged. This situation also exists in other villages. On the 12th, we had already had three consecutive days of snow. I went to Kehou Village in the Fifth District to visit, and the cadres there were also forcing the folks to sow; the folks harnessed the plows to the fields, but couldn't turn over the soil, so they came back. I also went to Baigeli Village, and the situation was the same.

    Our farmers are very dissatisfied with the cadres' coercive practices. I think: Promoting good experiences must conform to the local climate and specific conditions; leading production must pay attention to the opinions of the masses. These cadres do not follow the mass line in their work, but adopt coercive and commanding methods, which have a very bad influence. They should correct this mistake.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    嫩江县某些县区干部不应用强迫手段领导生产
    黑龙江省嫩江县七区合胜村农民孙万清来信：我向你们谈谈生产中的一个问题。我县老乡们学习肇源丰产经验后，情绪都很高。但是，四月初县区干部分头下乡，“动员”老乡出犁种小麦。我村老乡说：天气这么冷，土地没开化，怎么种？干部们却强逼着我们在七日那天就出犁。结果，地也翻不进，种不好；铧子打了四个、犁杖拉坏了一个。这种情形在别村也有。十二日那天，我们这里已经连下了三天雪。我到五区科后村去串门，那边干部也正逼着老乡种地；老乡套上犁杖到地里，翻也翻不动，就回来了。我又到百格理村，情形也是一样。
    我们农民对干部们这种强迫做法很不满意。我想：推广好经验必须符合当地气候和具体条件；领导生产必须重视群众的意见。这些干部在工作中不会走群众路线，而采用强迫命令手段，造成很坏影响。他们应该改正这种错误才对。
