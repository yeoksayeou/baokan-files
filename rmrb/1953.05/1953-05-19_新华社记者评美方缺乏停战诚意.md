Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 18th. (By our special correspondent Wu Min) As Washington expresses "indignation" in the face of world public opinion demanding a swift armistice in Korea, Harrison has adjourned the armistice talks for three days.

After the meeting on the 16th, Harrison told reporters that he did not know "the attitude of our allies across the ocean," but this American general, in the meeting tent, overturned the basis for resuming the armistice talks in the name of the United Nations Command, which, according to Harrison, also represents other countries.

The current armistice negotiations were resumed twenty-two days ago in an atmosphere of fervent worldwide hope for a swift armistice in Korea after the Korean and Chinese side made efforts and significant concessions on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. However, even before the resumption of the negotiations, U.S. chief negotiator Harrison had declared in his letter of April 16 that unless an agreement acceptable to the U.S. side was reached within a "reasonable time," "another adjournment would be appropriate." At the resumed negotiation meetings, Harrison threatened that "time is running out." Even the British newspaper "Manchester Guardian" considered Harrison "too arrogant," and the London "Daily Mirror" advised the "American politicians" in Washington to "understand that they cannot make the demands of victors, they have not achieved victory."

Another clumsy attempt by Harrison to obstruct the progress of the negotiations was his abuse of Asian countries with slander. He said that none of them were suitable to serve as neutral nations because they would be "subject to economic, political, and military pressure from the communists." In saying this, he did not take into account that Britain and Canada were willing to support Asian neutral nations and had openly expressed their willingness to do so. In fact, none of these five neutral nations seemed to satisfy Washington's demand that they be completely obedient. The statement by Senator Nolan, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, was publicized, saying that all five neutral nations had "helped and comforted the communists." Ignoring Washington's threats, world public opinion praised the Korean and Chinese side's eight-point proposal, believing that it opened the door to an armistice. Even Churchill felt it necessary to tell the British Parliament that "at present, we have no reason to believe that it [the Korean and Chinese side's proposal] cannot become the basis for reaching an agreement."

In Washington, Dulles attempted to create an impression to deceive the people, saying that the United States and its "allies" "unanimously believe" that the Korean and Chinese side's proposal needs to be "clarified and revised." After Clark in Tokyo stated that Washington and its "allies" had held "consultations," Harrison put forward his obstructive "counter-proposal" on May 13, attempting to overturn the basis of the current armistice negotiations. The "counter-proposal" demanded that more than two-thirds of the prisoners of war who would not be directly repatriated be immediately "released" into the hands of Syngman Rhee, and that the remaining one-third be subjected to a lifetime of exile after being held by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for a short sixty days. Due to the restrictions suggested by Harrison, this commission would be placed under U.S. military control.

The U.S. State Department attempted to dismiss the strong public outrage as a "misunderstanding" of Harrison's "counter-proposal." It declared: "The United Nations Command has accepted many of the opinions in the communist side's recent proposal as the basis for negotiations, and at the same time, has proposed some revisions to this plan in order to make the plan feasible." But everyone will understand that the so-called revisions are to overturn the principle, already agreed upon by both sides and recognized by the world, of handing over prisoners of war who would not be directly repatriated to neutral nations for custody. After General Nam Il exposed that Harrison's position was essentially to obstruct the armistice, he had to admit that the U.S. side's "counter-proposal" and the Korean and Chinese side's proposal were "completely opposite."

Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently commented on the Korean and Chinese side's proposal, saying that this proposal "seems to provide us with such a promising and solid basis for resolving urgent issues."

On the other hand, he pointed out that Harrison's "counter-proposal" and the position that the "United Nations still adheres to" are "very different." According to U.S. newspaper reports, members of the U.S. Congress expressed "indignation" at Nehru's arguments.

But it is worth noting that when Syngman Rhee stated bluntly that he opposed the armistice negotiations and reaching an armistice in Korea, Washington did not express "indignation." Apart from the anti-armistice elements in the United States, Harrison's "counter-proposal" also found supporters in the Syngman Rhee group. It is significant that this group expressed "satisfaction" with the U.S. side's "counter-proposal."

However, when Attlee said that some elements among the Americans did not want to see the end of the Korean War, Washington's "indignation" flared up quickly and threateningly. The reactions ranged from threatening to cut "U.S. aid," saying that Britain was giving "a terrible blow to the hand that feeds the British," to shouting that the United States "must be prepared to go it alone" in order to obstruct an early armistice and continue the Korean War.

But "indignation" and threats will never convince the world that the U.S. government truly wants an armistice in Korea. If Washington is truly sincere in reaching an armistice, it can easily express this sincerity in Panmunjom. When the delegation conference reconvenes on the 20th, only the actions of the U.S. representatives can show the world whether the U.S. government wants an armistice.

    新华社记者评美方缺乏停战诚意
    【新华社开城十八日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：当华盛顿方面在要求迅速在朝鲜停战的世界舆论面前表示“激怒”的时候，哈利逊把停战谈判休会三天。
    在十六日的会议以后，哈利逊告诉记者说，他不知道“海洋彼岸我们友邦们的态度”，但是，这位美国将军在会议帐篷内以联合国军司令部的名义推翻了恢复停战谈判的基础，而据哈利逊说，这个司令部也是代表其他国家的。
    现在的停战谈判是二十二天以前在朝中方面对战俘遣返问题作了努力和重大让步后，全世界都热烈希望迅速在朝鲜达成停战的气氛中恢复的。但是美国首席谈判代表哈利逊甚至在谈判恢复以前，就曾在他四月十六日的信中宣称，除非在“合理的时间内”达成一个可以为美方接受的协议，否则“再度休会将是适当的”。在恢复后的谈判会议上，哈利逊威胁着说“时间过得很快”。甚至英国报纸“曼彻斯特卫报”也认为哈利逊“太蛮横了”，伦敦“每日镜报”也劝告华盛顿的“美国政客们应该了解，他们不能够提出战胜者的条件，他们并没有得到胜利”。
    哈利逊的阻挠谈判进展的另一个拙劣企图就是他对亚洲国家滥施诬蔑。他说，它们没有一个适于充当中立国，因为它们要“受到共产党的经济、政治和军事的压力”。他这样说就没有考虑到，英国和加拿大是愿意支持亚洲中立国的，并且曾公开表明它们要这样作的意愿。事实上，这五个中立国没有一个似乎可以满足华盛顿要它们百依百顺的要求。参议院共和党政策委员会主席诺兰的声明曾被宣扬过，他说，五个中立国都曾“帮助和安慰过共产党”。世界舆论不顾华盛顿的威胁，都称赞朝中方面的八点方案，认为这个方案打开了停战的大门。甚至邱吉尔也觉得有必要告诉英国议会说：“目前我们没有理由认为它（朝中方面的方案）不可能成为达成协议的基础”。
    在华盛顿，杜勒斯企图造成一种印象来蒙蔽人民，他说，美国和它的“盟国”都“一致认为”朝中方面的方案需要“加以澄清和修正”。在东京的克拉克声明华盛顿和它的“盟国”已举行“商讨”以后，哈利逊就提出了他五月十三日的阻挠停战的“反建议”，企图推翻目前的停战谈判的基础。“反建议”要求把三分之二以上不直接遣返的战俘立即“释放”到李承晚的手里，并把另外的三分之一经过中立国遣返委员会短短六十天的看管之后，投入终生的流亡。由于哈利逊所建议的限制，这个委员会将被放在美国军事控制之下。
    美国国务院企图把强烈的公愤说成对哈利逊“反建议”的“误解”。它宣称：“联合国军司令部接受了共方这个最近的建议中的许多意见作为谈判的基础，同时并对这个计划提出了一些修正，以便使计划得以实行”。但是一切人都会明白，所谓修正就是推翻双方已经同意的和世界公认的把不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国看管的原则。在南日大将揭露了哈利逊的立场实质上是阻挠停战之后，他不得不承认美方的“反建议”和朝中方面的建议“完全相反”。
    印度总理尼赫鲁不久前评论朝中方面的建议说，这个建议“似乎给我们在解决迫切的问题上提供了这样一个有希望的坚实的基础”。
    另一方面，他指出哈利逊的“反建议”和“联合国现在还遵守”的立场是“有很大差别的”。根据美国报纸报道，美国国会人士对于尼赫鲁的这些论点表示“激怒”。
    但是值得注意的是，在李承晚直截了当地说它反对停战谈判和在朝鲜达成停战的时候，华盛顿方面并没有表示“激怒”。除了在美国的反停战分子外，哈利逊的“反建议”还在李承晚集团里找到了拥护者。意味深长地是这个集团对美方的“反建议”表示“满意”。
    但是，当艾德礼说美国人当中有些分子不愿看见朝鲜战争结束的时候，华盛顿方面的“激怒”就发作得很快，而且带有威胁性了。反应的范围很广，从威胁要削减“美援”，说英国给“喂养英国人的手一个可怕的打击”，直到喊叫美国“必须准备单独干下去”，以便阻挠早日停战和继续朝鲜战争。
    但是“激怒”和威胁绝不会使世界相信美国政府真想在朝鲜停战。如果华盛顿真有达成停战的诚意，它可以很容易地在板门店表示这种诚意。当代表团大会在二十日复会的时候，只有美方代表的行动才能够向世界表明美国政府是不是想停战。
