Rainfall has occurred in most parts of the country from the end of April to the beginning of May, and farmers everywhere are planting intensively.

In the Northeast region, rain fell in the entire provinces of Rehe and Liaoxi, and parts of Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces. Rehe Province, which was originally the most in need of rain, had two heavy rains. The southern areas of Chengde, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, and Beipiao are already thoroughly soaked, while the northern areas of Weichang and Chifeng had less rainfall and are suitable for planting. In Liaoxi Province, the northern counties of Kangping, Faku, Tieling, and Changtu were thoroughly soaked by April 28th, and the central counties were also soaked through. The southern counties, due to the more severe drought previously, still lack one or two inches to connect with the underlying moisture after this rain, but planting is not a problem. In Heilongjiang Province, the southern part had drought symptoms, but after this rain of one or two inches, the drought symptoms have been alleviated. Currently, only the western part of Jilin Province still has a more serious drought. In the North China region, both Hebei and Shanxi provinces received rain. The southern 38 counties of Hebei Province and the Changzhi, Linfen, and Yuncheng special districts of Shanxi Province were thoroughly soaked before May 1st. From May 3rd to 8th, the northern special districts of Tangshan, Tongxian, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province, and the Yuci and Yanbei special districts of Shanxi Province, also received rain successively. Rainfall was less in some areas, but it is generally suitable for planting. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, only the Zhaowuda League and the former Jerim League areas received rain, and the rainfall was small, so the drought is still developing. In the Southwest region, most parts of Yunnan Province, the Xichang Special District of Xikang Province, and several counties in the southwest of Guizhou Province, which were originally lacking rain and affecting rice transplanting, have seen an improvement after this rain. The drought in Guizhou Province has been relieved.

In the East China and Central South regions, before this rain, some areas of Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces had drought symptoms. After the rain, most of the drought symptoms were relieved, except for some areas of Hubei Province which still lack rain, affecting rice transplanting. Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi have had too much rainfall, but rainfall in Zhejiang is still small.

The Northwest region had more rain and snow last winter and this spring. From May 2nd to 3rd, the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province received another 10 to 25 millimeters of rain. There was also light rain in southern and northern Shaanxi, and southern Gansu. Currently, the entire region is generally not lacking rain.

The spring sowing in the northern regions and the rice transplanting in the southern provinces are currently in an intense stage. This spring rain is of considerable benefit to agricultural production. However, in some areas the rainfall is only enough for planting or transplanting, and attention should be paid to drought resistance and seedling protection in the future. In areas with excessive rainfall, it is necessary to prevent mountain floods and internal waterlogging from causing disasters. A small number of areas still have drought symptoms, and continued efforts should be made to prevent and combat drought to ensure the smooth completion of spring sowing and transplanting.

    全国大部地区降雨各地农民紧张播种
    从四月底到五月初，全国大部地区喜降春雨，各地农民正在紧张播种。
    东北区的热河、辽西全省和松江、黑龙江两省各一部地区都下了雨。原来最缺雨的热河省下了两场大雨，南部承德、凌源、朝阳、北票一带已经下透，北部围场、赤峰一带雨量较小，可以播种。辽西省北部康平、法库、铁岭、昌图等县四月二十八日已经下透，中部各县也下透了；南部各县因以前干旱较重，这次雨后还差一二寸未接上底墒，但播种无问题。黑龙江省南部原有旱象，这次下了一、二寸雨，旱象已经缓和。目前只有吉林省西部旱象还较严重。华北区河北、山西两省都下了雨，河北省南部三十八个县和山西省长治、临汾、运城等专区五月一日前已经下透。五月三日至八日，河北省北部的唐山、通县、天津、张家口等专区和山西省的榆次、雁北等专区又陆续降雨，部分地区雨量较小，一般都可以播种。内蒙古自治区只有昭乌达盟和原哲里木盟地区下了雨，雨量又小，目前旱象还在发展。西南区云南省的大部地区和西康省西昌专区和贵州省西南部几个县，原来缺雨，影响栽秧，这次雨后情况已经好转。贵州省的旱象已经解除。
    华东、中南地区，在这次雨前，湖北、河南、山东、江苏、安徽的一部分地区有旱象，雨后旱象大部解除，只有湖北省还有一部分地区缺雨，影响插秧。福建、湖南、江西、广东、广西各地降雨已经过多，但浙江雨量仍小。
    西北区去冬今春雨雪较多。五月二日至三日，陕西省关中一带又降雨十公厘到二十五公厘。陕南、陕北、陇南也有小雨。目前全区一般还不缺雨。
    北方地区的春播和南方各省的插秧，目前都在紧张阶段。这场春雨对农业生产有相当大的好处。但有些地区雨量仅够播种或插秧的需要，今后还需注意抗旱保苗；雨量过多的地区，要防止山洪内涝成灾；少数地区还有旱象，要继续大力防旱抗旱，保证春播和插秧顺利完成。
