    The Birth of a New Life
    Wu Jialing
    In a mountain village on the east coast of Korea, the second daughter-in-law of farmer Han Yunfeng, Han Jilian, was experiencing a difficult labor. Two days had passed, and the baby had not yet been born. The mother lay on the heated kang bed, crying out in pain. Old man Han and his wife looked at their daughter-in-law's condition, their hearts aching as if cut by a knife. However, there were no doctors nearby, and the local experienced midwives had never encountered such a severe case of difficult labor. What could they do to save the mother and the baby in her womb?
    Just as the family was anxious and uneasy, the old woman suddenly thought of an idea. She said, "Let's go find the Chinese People's Volunteers!" When old man Han heard that they should find the Volunteers, his heart immediately lit up, but he worriedly said, "The Volunteers know how to fight battles, how could they deliver babies?" The old woman firmly believed that the Volunteers would definitely be able to help them solve this difficulty. Therefore, the old woman ran to a company headquarters of the Volunteers stationed nearby and told the company's political instructor, Zhang Jinju, about her daughter-in-law's difficult labor. When the old woman saw the instructor pick up the telephone receiver and request the higher authorities to solve this problem immediately, tears of gratitude streamed down her face. She immediately ran back to tell old man Han, "Our benefactor has been found! Our daughter-in-law is saved!"
    In the command headquarters of a certain unit of the Volunteers, Political Commissar Li Youping received Zhang Jinju's report and immediately summoned the head of the health station to jointly study how to rescue the child and mother in danger. Although there were many difficulties for army doctors to perform a delivery, they said: We must save them! We must relieve this woman's suffering, and we must ensure that this new life is born safely!
    Enemy planes constantly swept across the clear sky. On a highway leading to a mountain village, a small jeep sped along, braving the danger of air raids. An hour later, the car stopped in front of the Korean farmer Han's house. The Volunteers' doctor Jiang Xiaofu, head nurse Jin Shangmo, and nurse Luo Guanghui got out of the car. Many Korean villagers had already gathered by the roadside, and they welcomed these three medical personnel into old man Han's house. Subsequently, they gathered outside the door, waiting for good news.
    After thirty minutes, the medical personnel came out of the room. They told everyone that the mother had undergone preliminary examination and treatment, but her pain could not be relieved immediately, and the baby could not be born immediately. She had to be taken to the hospital for surgery.
    Soon, the mother was safely carried to the nearby field hospital of the Volunteers. After very careful diagnosis and treatment, the mother's pain was finally relieved.
    At around 10 o'clock at night, a "wah wah" sound came from the maternity ward. A new life was born. The head nurse bathed the chubby baby and wrapped her in a soft swaddling cloth. The old woman looked at her daughter-in-law and granddaughter, tears of excitement and gratitude flowing down her face. She settled her daughter-in-law and child before finally lying down to rest, because she had been awake for two days and nights.
    The next morning, many relatives and friends of old man Han came to the hospital to visit the mother. They sat beside the mother and held the newborn chubby baby. At this time, the Volunteers' medical personnel brought milk for the mother. The villagers laughed and jumped up, dozens of hands reaching out to the medical personnel, and the room was filled with enthusiastic voices of gratitude: "Volunteer Army Cao Si Mi Da (the best)!" "The Volunteer Army is truly the benefactor of the Korean people!" The mother, Han Jilian, said to her relatives and friends: "Go back and work hard to produce, and I will definitely recuperate well. When the child grows up, I will make her remember firmly the kindness of the Volunteer comrades who saved our mother and daughter, and work hard to build our motherland!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    一个新生命的诞生
    吴迦陵
    在朝鲜东海岸的一个山村里，农民韩云凤老汉的二媳妇韩纪连难产，已经两天了，孩子还没有生下来。产妇躺在炕上痛苦地叫喊着。韩老汉和他的老妻看着媳妇的样子，心里像刀割一样地难受。但是附近没有医生，乡里的一些老接生婆又从来没有遇到过这样严重的难产，有什么办法来解救产妇和她肚子里的孩子呢？
    正在一家人焦虑不安的时候，老婆婆忽然想起一个办法，她说，去找中国人民志愿军吧！韩老汉听说去找志愿军，心里一下亮起来，可是他担忧地说：“志愿军会打仗，怎么能接生呢？”老婆婆却坚决地相信：志愿军一定能够帮助他们解决这个困难。于是，老婆婆就跑到住在附近的志愿军的一个连部里，把媳妇难产的事情告诉了连政治指导员张金聚。老婆婆看见指导员拿起了电话耳机请求上级机关马上解决这个问题的时候，感激的眼泪流到了脸上。她马上飞跑回去向韩老汉说：“恩人找到了！媳妇有救了！”
    在志愿军某部指挥机关里，政治委员李右平接到张金聚的报告后，立即把卫生所长找来，共同研究怎样救护正在危急中的孩子和母亲。虽然，军队的医生接生是有许多困难的，但是他们说：一定要救！一定要解除这个妇女的痛苦，一定要让这个新生命平安地诞生下来！
    敌机不时地在晴朗的天空中掠过。在通向一个山村的公路上，有一辆小吉普车冒着空袭的危险在飞驰着。一小时后，车子停在朝鲜农民韩老汉的家门口，车上下来了志愿军的医生蒋孝福、护士长金尚默和女护士罗广辉。路旁已经挤满了许多朝鲜老乡，他们把这三位医务人员迎进了韩老汉的家里。随后，他们就围聚在门外等候好消息。
    过了三十分钟，医务人员从房里走出来。他们告诉大家说，产妇已经过初步的检查和治疗，但是还不能马上解除痛苦，孩子也不能马上生下来，一定要到医院里去动手术。
    不久，产妇被安全地抬到了附近志愿军的战地医院里，经过十分仔细的诊治，产妇的痛苦终于被解除了。
    夜里十时左右，产妇病房里传出了“哇哇”的声音，一个新的生命诞生了。护士长给胖胖的婴儿洗了澡，并且把她裹在柔软的襁褓里。老婆婆望着媳妇和孙女儿，流着兴奋和感激的眼泪。她安顿了媳妇和孩子，才安心地躺下来休息，因为她已经有两昼夜没有睡觉了。
    第二天清晨，韩老汉的许多亲友到医院里来探望产妇。他们坐在产妇身旁，抱起了新出生的胖娃娃。这时，志愿军医务人员又给产妇送来了牛奶。老乡们笑着跳了起来，几十只手一齐伸向医务人员，房子里响起热烈感谢的声音：“志愿军曹斯米达（顶好）！”“志愿军真是朝鲜人民的恩人！”。产妇韩纪连对亲友们说：“你们回去好好劳动生产，我也一定好好休养。将来孩子长大了，要她牢牢地记住志愿军同志救活我们母女的恩情，努力建设我们的祖国！”        （新华社）
