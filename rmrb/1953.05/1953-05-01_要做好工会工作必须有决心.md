To Do a Good Job in Trade Union Work, One Must Have Determination
Qi Tinghan, Chairman of the Trade Union of Factory 53

    Before the convocation of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent me to major administrative regions to convey the experience of Factory 53. Before setting off, the trade union of our factory held a meeting of cadres. Everyone guaranteed to complete the first quarter's tasks ahead of schedule as a gift to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and told me to set off without worry. I also guaranteed that this time I would definitely complete the task assigned to me by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and introduce the experience of Factory 53 to brother factories and mines across the country, bit by bit.
    I left Factory 53 on March 12th, and so far, I have made reports in four regions: East China, Central South, Southwest, and North China. I have also attended many symposiums and visited many brother factories. Workers in various places attached great importance to the experience of Factory 53, and their determination to complete the national construction plan was very strong. In Shanghai, I visited a machinery factory. The workers there were manufacturing a new product—a universal grinder, which China had never manufactured before. They were very enthusiastic and guaranteed to complete the delivery of the new product in the second quarter as a gift to "May Day" and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. At a cadre symposium in East China, everyone expressed that they would study the experience of Factory 53 even better in the future, join hands with us, and launch a comrade-like competition. The students of the trade union cadre school in the Southwest region, after listening to my report, expressed that they would study hard and devote themselves to the cause of national construction. The representatives of the Second Trade Union Member Congress of Chongqing City, representing hundreds of thousands of workers in the city, presented all the staff and workers of Factory 53 with a red flag, on which was written: "We will continue to learn from the experience of Factory 53 in the future and strive to complete the national construction plan!" Many local trade union and administrative cadres left me their mailing addresses, and agreed to learn from each other and exchange work experience in the future. The workers in these regions are working hard and studying hard to complete the national construction plan. Some factories and mines have further developed the experience of Factory 53 in certain aspects of their work. All this has given me great encouragement.
    In the past, some cadres were unwilling to do trade union work. This time, at many symposiums, the trade union comrades all expressed that they would work hard to learn advanced experience and do a good job in trade union work. Based on my experience, determination is very important for doing a good job in trade union work. I was transferred to work in the factory trade union in 1947 due to injuries. At that time, no one had any experience, there was no guarantee of completing production tasks, and many cadres were not at ease with their work. However, I never wavered. I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's words: We must overcome difficulties, and we must learn what we do not understand. Therefore, I went deep into the masses and looked for solutions from the masses. I studied with the workers and summarized the organizational form to guarantee production—the group covenant, and reported it to the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, we promoted this experience. Soon, we further signed contact contracts and collective contracts, and made them a system. From then on, the trade union was able to regularly ensure the completion of production tasks. At the end of March, I had just returned to Beijing from the Southwest when I received a letter from my factory, knowing that all the staff and workers of the factory had completed the first quarter's production tasks thirteen days ahead of schedule. They expressed that they now have more confidence to overcome all difficulties and ensure the completion of the April production tasks as a gift to "May Day" and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. All this fully shows that as long as our trade union cadres are determined to "dig in" and look for solutions from the masses, any difficulty can be overcome.
    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is about to be convened. This congress marks a new victory for the working people of the whole country and marks that the motherland has entered a new historical period. The important task of our trade union organization is to, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, thoroughly organize the masses, mobilize the masses, and resolutely complete and over fulfill the glorious task of national economic construction. In the past, although our Factory 53 has achieved certain results, these achievements are all due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, as well as the efforts of all the staff and workers of the factory. But we cannot be complacent in the slightest. In the future, we must not only join hands with workers across the country to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national production tasks, but also work doubly hard to continue to improve the experience of Factory 53 on the basis of our existing work, so as not to disappoint everyone's expectations of us.

    要做好工会工作必须有决心
    五三工厂工会主席　齐廷汉
    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会召开以前，中华全国总工会派我到各大行政区去传达五三工厂经验。没有出发以前，我们厂工会召开了一个干部会议，大家保证提前完成第一季度任务，向中国工会第七次全国代表大会献礼，叫我放心前去。我也保证这回一定完成全国总工会交给我的任务，把五三工厂经验一点一滴地向全国兄弟厂矿介绍出去。
    我从三月十二日离开了五三工厂，到现在为止，已经到华东、中南、西南、华北四个地区作了传达报告。并出席了许多座谈会，参观了许多兄弟工厂。各地工人兄弟对于五三工厂的经验非常重视，完成祖国建设计划的决心非常坚强。在上海的时候，我参观了一个机械工厂。那里的工人正在制造一种新的产品——万能磨床，这是中国过去从来没有制造过的。他们热情很高，保证完成第二季度新产品的交工任务，向“五一”和中国工会第七次全国代表大会献礼。在华东的一次干部座谈会上，大家表示今后更要好好学习五三工厂经验，和我们携起手来，展开同志般的竞赛。西南区工会干部学校的同学们，听了我的报告，表示一定学好功课，投入祖国建设事业。重庆市第二届工会会员代表大会的代表们，代表全市几十万工人，送给五三工厂全体职工一面红旗，上面写着“我们今后要继续学习五三厂的经验，为完成国家建设计划而奋斗！”许多地方的工会和行政干部，都给我留下了通讯地址，约好今后互相学习，交流工作经验。这些地区的工人兄弟，正在为着完成祖国的建设计划，努力学习，努力工作着。有的厂矿在某些工作上，已经进一步发展了五三工厂的经验。这一切，都给我以很大的鼓舞。
    过去曾经有些干部不愿做工会工作。这回，在多次座谈会上，工会干部同志们，都表示要努力学习先进经验，搞好工会工作。根据我的体验，下决心，对于做好工会工作是很重要的。我从一九四七年起，因负伤被调到工厂里做工会工作。当时，谁也没有什么经验，保证不了生产任务的完成，许多干部不安心工作。但是，我从来没有动摇过。我牢牢记住了毛主席的话：我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。因此，我便深入群众，向群众找办法。我和工人一起研究，总结了保证生产的组织形式——小组公约，汇报给党。又在党的领导下，推广了这条经验。不久，我们又进一步签订了联系合同和集体合同，并且把它订为制度。从此以后，工会便能够经常保证生产任务的完成。三月底，我刚刚从西南回到北京，便接到我厂来信，知道全厂职工已经提前十三天完成了第一季度生产任务。他们表示，今后更有信心，克服一切困难，保证完成四月份生产任务，向“五一”和中国工会第七次全国代表大会献礼。这一切完全说明：我们工会干部，只要下决心“钻进去”，向群众找办法，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会就要召开了。这个大会，标志着全国劳动人民的新的胜利，标志着祖国已经进入新的历史时期。我们工会组织的重要任务，就是要在中国共产党的领导下，深入组织群众，发动群众，坚决完成和超额完成国家经济建设的光荣任务。过去，我们五三工厂虽然已经取得了一定的成绩；这些成绩，都是毛主席和共产党的正确领导以及全厂职工群众的努力得来的。但是我们丝毫也不能骄傲自满。我们今后不但要和全国各地工人兄弟一道，保证完成与超额完成国家的生产任务，而且更要加倍努力，在现有的工作基础上继续提高五三工厂的经验，才不辜负大家对我们的希望。
