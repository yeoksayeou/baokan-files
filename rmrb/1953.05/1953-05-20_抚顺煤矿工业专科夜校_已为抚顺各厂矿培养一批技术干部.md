    Fushun Coal Mine Industrial Technical Night School
    Has Trained a Group of Technical Cadres for Various Factories and Mines in Fushun
    The Fushun Coal Mine Industrial Technical Night School is a regularized part-time school. The work of this school proves that in large-scale economic construction, adopting the method of part-time education is an important way to rapidly train and improve technical cadres.
    The Fushun Coal Mine Industrial Technical Night School was established in October 1949. Two hundred and two on-the-job cadres who originally had high school or senior vocational school level have reached the cultural and technical level of one to three years of a regular junior college through night school studies; thirty-nine people have improved from the level of junior high school graduates to the level of the first year of junior college; three hundred and sixty-four technical personnel with a cultural level below junior high school have improved to the level of the first and second grades or above of regular secondary technical schools. Due to the improvement of their cultural and technical level, twenty-eight technicians from the night school students have been promoted to take on the work of technicians, assistant engineers, and section chiefs; sixty-five technical workers have taken on the positions of technicians.
    The Fushun Coal Mine Industrial Technical Night School is attached to the Fushun Coal Mine Industrial Technical School, and the work of the entire school is under the unified leadership of the principal of the Industrial Technical School. The night school has an office and full-time cadres to carry out work. Most of the courses are taught by the teachers of the industrial school, and the equipment is also used jointly. In order to meet the urgent needs of on-the-job technical personnel and new graduates from secondary technical schools to continue to improve their cultural and technical level, the school has set up a specialized department and an intermediate technical department to cultivate talents equivalent to junior college and secondary technical school levels. The enrollment targets are technical personnel and some technical workers with a cultural level of high school and junior high school or above. According to the needs of local factories and mines, each of the two departments has five subjects such as coal mining and mining machinery, and the study period is specified as four years and three years respectively. There are more than 700 students in the two departments. The school stipulates that classes are held three evenings a week, with three hours of class each evening, and another hour for teachers to guide students to review their lessons. One evening a week is also set aside to make up lessons for students who are absent due to official business or whose level is uneven, and to hold elective courses. The Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also stipulates that the party organizations of each factory and mine must ensure the vocational spare time for workers to study for three evenings a week. The night school has a relatively sound system for enrollment, examination and student management. The night school frequently sends people to contact various factories and mines, and selects and appoints counselors in each factory and mine with night school students. All factories and mines attach importance to and support the work of the night school, and regard the academic performance of students as a reference for promoting cadres. The students are very enthusiastic about learning, and their progress is also very rapid. For example, in the recent sampling test of the alternating current motor course, which is equivalent to the third year of university, in the Wang Sichun class of the electrician department, the scores of all students in the class were above 70 points.

    抚顺煤矿工业专科夜校
    已为抚顺各厂矿培养一批技术干部
    抚顺煤矿工业专科夜校是一个正规化的业余学校。这所学校的工作证明了在大规模经济建设中，采取业余教育的方式是迅速培养和提高技术干部的一个重要途径。
    抚顺煤矿工业专科夜校是一九四九年十月成立的。原有高中或高级职业学校水平的在职干部经过夜校学习，已有二百零二人达到了正规专科学校一年到三年的文化、技术水平；有三十九人从原初中毕业的程度提高到专科学校一年级的水平；有三百六十四个初中以下文化程度的技术人员，提高到正规中等技术学校一、二年级以上的水平。由于文化技术水平的提高，夜校学员中有二十八名技术员被提拔担负了技师、助理工程师和科长的工作；有六十五名技术工人担任了技术员的职务。
    抚顺煤矿工业专科夜校附设在抚顺煤矿工业技术学校内，全校工作由工业技术学校校长统一领导，夜校设有办公室和专职干部进行工作。大部分课程由工业学校的教员担任，设备也共同应用。该校为了满足在职技术人员和新从中等技术学校毕业的学生迫切需要继续提高文化和技术水平的要求，设立了一个专门部和一个中级技术部，以培养相等于专科学校和中等技术学校的人才，招生的对象为高中和初中以上文化程度的技术人员和部分技术工人。根据当地厂矿的需要，两部各设采煤、矿山机械等五科，学习年限分别规定为四年和三年。两部学生共有七百多名。该校规定每星期三个晚上上课，每晚各上课三小时，另有一小时由教师指导复习功课。每星期还抽一个晚上专门为因公缺课和水平不齐的学员补课和举办选修课。中共抚顺市委员会并规定：每周三个晚上职工业余学习时间各厂、矿党的组织必须保证夜校在招生、考试和学生管理上都有比较健全的制度。夜校经常派人和各厂、矿联系，并在每个有夜校学生的厂、矿选任了辅导员。各厂、矿都重视和支持夜校的工作，并把学员的学习成绩作为提升干部的参考。学生们学习热情都很高，他们的进步也很快。如电工科王四春班最近抽考了相当于大学三年级的交流电机的课程，全班学员的成绩都在七十分以上。　（新华社）
