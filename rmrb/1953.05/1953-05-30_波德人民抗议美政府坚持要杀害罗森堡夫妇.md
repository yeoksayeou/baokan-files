Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: The U.S. Supreme Court's third rejection of the Rosenbergs' appeal and its preparation to execute the Rosenbergs with haste have aroused anger and protest from the people of Poland and Germany.

    The Polish newspaper "Warsaw Life" published a commentary on the 28th entitled "They are Extorting with the Death Penalty," raising a serious protest from the Polish people against the U.S. judicial authorities. The commentary pointed out that for more than two years, agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation have been constantly trying to destroy the will of the Rosenbergs in prison, forcing them to sign false testimonies. The newspaper wants everyone to pay attention to the opinion of the famous American writer Howard Fast, who believes that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and judicial authorities created the "Rosenberg case" to use Tito's fascists and some intimidated "witnesses" to force the Rosenbergs to fabricate false testimonies to frame American Communist leaders and American progressives. Because the Rosenbergs resolutely refused to participate in this shameful conspiracy of the American rulers, the American court sentenced them to death.
    "Warsaw Life" said: "The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the retrial of (the Rosenbergs') case... But world opinion is unanimously condemning those who use the death penalty as a means of extortion, and opposing those who are preparing to murder two innocent ordinary people."
    In the German Democratic Republic, the Presidium of the Berlin Executive Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic has sent a telegram to Eisenhower on behalf of all German patriots, demanding the immediate restoration of the Rosenbergs' freedom. After the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling on the 25th rejecting the Rosenbergs' appeal, people in various parts of the German Democratic Republic expressed their protest. Pogschurski, Chairman of the Dresden Association of the All-German Democratic Lawyers Association, issued a statement saying that the measures of the U.S. judicial authorities "completely expose a cold-blooded and brutal plan to murder two innocent people."
    West German workers also responded to the movement to save the Rosenbergs. Six hundred workers in West Berlin signed an appeal demanding the release of the Rosenbergs.

    波德人民抗议美政府坚持要杀害罗森堡夫妇
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国最高法院第三次拒绝罗森堡夫妇上诉并准备从速处死罗森堡夫妇，激起波兰与德国人民的愤怒与抗议。
    波兰“华沙生活”报二十八日发表“他们以死刑来讹诈”的评论，提出了波兰人民对美国司法当局的严重抗议。评论指出：两年多以来，美国联邦调查局的特务不断企图摧毁在狱中的罗森堡夫妇的意志，强迫他们在虚伪的证辞上签字。该报要大家注意美国著名作家法斯特的意见，法斯特认为，美国联邦调查局和司法当局制造“罗森堡案件”，是想利用铁托法西斯分子和一些受恐吓的“证人”，迫使罗森堡夫妇编造假证辞，陷害美国共产党领袖及美国进步人士。因为罗森堡夫妇坚决拒绝参加美国统治者这一个可耻的阴谋，美国法院才把他们判处死刑。
    “华沙生活”报说：“美国最高法院拒绝了重审
    （罗森堡夫妇的）案件……但是全世界的舆论都在一致指斥那些把死刑当作讹诈手段的人，都在反对那些准备谋杀两个无辜老百姓的人。”
    在民主德国，民主德国全国阵线柏林执行委员会主席团已代表德国一切爱国者打电报给艾森豪威尔，要求立即恢复罗森堡夫妇的自由。在美国最高法院二十五日作出拒绝罗森堡夫妇上诉的判决后，民主德国各地人民纷纷表示抗议。全德民主法律工作者联合会德累斯顿协会主席波格舒尔斯基发表声明说：美国司法当局的措施“完全暴露了是一个谋杀两个无辜人民的冷酷残暴的计划”。
    西德工人也响应拯救罗森堡夫妇的运动。柏林西区的工人六百人在一份呼吁书上签名，要求释放罗森堡夫妇。
