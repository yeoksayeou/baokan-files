    Strive for a Peace Pact
    --Editorial from the Soviet "Izvestia"

    The question of peace is a matter of deep concern to the people of all countries. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are closely watching the evolution of the international situation. They welcome every measure aimed at consolidating peace and condemn the actions of governments that are unwilling to ease international tensions. People are examining the policies of certain governments and countries based on their attitude towards the issue of peace. Peaceful resolution of disputes between major powers is of great significance to the cause of peace. Everyone understands that if the major powers reach agreement and cooperate peacefully with each other, then universal peace can be guaranteed. It is precisely for this reason that the idea of the five major powers—the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—concluding a peace pact has taken firm hold of the people of all countries.
    
    World public opinion is very satisfied with the replies of the governments of the countries of the peace and democracy camp to the suggestion by the International Committee of the World Peace Congress that the five major powers should consult to conclude a peace pact. Based on its policy of consolidating peace and international cooperation, the Soviet government believes that there are no disputes or outstanding issues that cannot be resolved peacefully through mutual consultation among the countries concerned. Therefore, it supports the demands of the World Peace Congress. This new expression of the Soviet Union's desire for peace strengthens the confidence of the people of all strata in various countries, making them believe that the international situation has greatly improved, and that there are broad prospects for easing the current tense international situation. Simultaneously with the Soviet government, the governments of the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries have all announced their full support for the proposal of the World Peace Congress. The countries of the democratic camp have unanimously expressed their willingness to cooperate with the people of all countries to consolidate universal peace and international security.
    
    Now, a vigorous social movement is unfolding around the world, demanding a peaceful resolution of international disputes through consultation. "Due to recent events, the proposition of consultation has gained the support of millions more people. These events tell the people of all countries that they can use their own actions to ease international tensions, and that the easing of international tensions is beneficial to everyone and is a source of prosperity." This is what the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out as the most prominent feature of the current international situation and the task of the international peace movement at this stage. The meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm on May 5th and 6th pointed out that public opinion in various countries has widely responded to the call of the World Peace Congress, advocating that the five major powers should hold consultations to conclude a peace pact. The communiqué of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council stated: "The clear truths that the peace movement has been propagating for years and the wise cause that the peace movement supports have begun to bear fruit. New circumstances have formed, requiring us to redouble our efforts." Many facts show that the call to redouble efforts to strive for cooperation and friendship among the people of all countries has been well received. More and more upright people from all social strata are participating in the struggle for peace, and they have reached consensus on the program formulated by the Vienna World People's Peace Congress.
    
    Public opinion in all countries unanimously supports the action of the International Committee of the World Peace Congress in writing to governments of all countries to request their support for the proposal to conclude a peace pact between the five major powers. The governments of capitalist countries have not yet replied to this proposal. This silence is clearly in opposition to broad public opinion, because public opinion firmly advocates taking concrete measures conducive to peace and international security.
    
    The peace defense committees of various countries and some social organizations including people of various political beliefs, representing millions of ordinary people in the United Kingdom, France, India, Finland, Lebanon, Argentina, Brazil, and other countries, have requested their governments to promote the conclusion of a peace pact. People of all countries are holding peace conferences and representative meetings under the slogan of opposing the conspiracies of the enemies of peace, striving for peaceful resolution of international disputes, and developing international cooperation. The Cultural Congress of the Americas is of great significance for further unfolding the peace movement in the Americas. At the recently held All-Japan Peace Congress, the representatives said: "We want to make Japan a base of peace instead of a US military base." The mass rallies and demonstrations for defending peace held in many provinces of India show that the peace movement in India has already taken on a national character. In Finland, Peace Week is being held from May 10th to 17th. In the United Kingdom, the National Peace Action Conference will be convened on May 16th, and 1,500 representatives with various opinions and beliefs have been invited to participate. The British Peace Committee has decided on the purpose of this conference: "In order for Britain to play an effective role in striving for international peace and improving relations between countries, the conference should find a unified way of action."
    
    Various peace conferences, representative conferences, and rallies have expressed the opinions of peace-loving people of all countries on the most acute international issues. All progressive humanity advocates that, following the resolution of the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war in Korea, some other issues hindering the Korean armistice can be resolved comprehensively. This will of the people of all countries is opposed to the schemes of the open or secret enemies of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, who are still trying to continue to drag out the Korean War.
    
    The German question is one of the most important international issues. The communiqué of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council emphasizes: "To maintain peace, it is also necessary for the four major powers to hold negotiations on the German question in order to seek a peaceful solution to the problem." Solving the German question requires taking into account the vital interests of all of Germany's neighbors and how to consolidate European peace, and first and foremost, the wishes of the German people themselves must be considered. Everyone knows what these interests are, and what methods should be used to justly resolve the German question. That is to conclude a German peace treaty as quickly as possible, which will enable the German people to establish a unified country and be able to achieve their due position in the cooperation of peace-loving people of all countries.
    
    Good people all over the world know that there is now a reactionary force that directly or indirectly prevents the easing of international tensions. This force, which is particularly rampant in the United States, is "trembling in the face of peace," and this fear cannot be concealed by any pretense of peace-loving words. In fact, the activities of the Atlantic Group have shown no signs of slowing down the arms race or reducing the military bases established by this group around the world. In this situation, the task of peace-loving people in all countries is to: raise vigilance against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and mobilize new millions to defend peace. This is also the task of the World Peace Council meeting to be held in Budapest on June 15th. The Soviet people are firmly committed to defending the cause of peace and unanimously support the international peace movement and the proposal to conclude a peace pact between the five major powers. The Communist Party and the Soviet government firmly believe that an international policy of peace is the only correct and necessary policy that is in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries.

    争取和平公约
    ——苏联“消息报”社论
    和平这个问题是各国人民深切关心的问题。世界上亿万人民都密切地注视着国际局势的演变，他们欢迎每一个旨在巩固和平的措施，谴责那些不愿意缓和国际紧张局势的政府的行动。人民就在对待和平问题的态度上来检查有些政府和国家的政策。和平解决大国之间的争端对和平事业具有极重大的意义。谁都明白，如果大国之间取得协议，并且互相和平合作，那末普遍和平就可以得到保证。正因为如此，要求五大国——苏联、中华人民共和国、美国、英国、法国——缔结和平公约的思想才紧紧地掌握了各国人民。
    世界舆论对和平民主阵营各国政府给世界人民和平大会国际委员会要求五大国协商以缔结和平公约的建议的答复感到非常满意。苏联政府本着巩固和平与国际合作的政策，认为没有任何纠纷或悬案不能在有关各国互相协商的基础上和平解决，所以它支持世界人民和平大会的要求。苏联希望和平的新表示加强各国各阶层的人民的信心，使他们相信国际形势大大的改善，和目前紧张的国际局势的缓和，已有了广阔的前途。与苏联政府同时，中华人民共和国，波兰人民共和国，捷克斯洛伐克共和国，罗马尼亚人民共和国，保加利亚人民共和国，匈牙利人民共和国，德意志民主共和国等国政府都宣布完全支持世界人民和平大会的建议。民主阵营各国一致表示愿与各国人民合作，以巩固普遍和平和国际安全。
    现在在世界各地正在蓬勃地展开要求在协商的基础上和平解决国际争端的社会运动。“由于最近的事件，协商的主张又另外获得千百万人的拥护。这些事件告诉各国人民，他们可以用自己的行动使国际紧张局势缓和下来，而国际局势的缓和对大家都有好处，这是繁荣的泉源。”这就是世界和平理事会常务委员会所指出的、目前国际形势中最显著的特点和现阶段国际和平运动的任务。世界和平理事会常务委员会五月五日和六日在斯德哥尔摩举行的会议上指出，各国的舆论都普遍地响应世界人民和平大会的号召，主张五大国进行协商，以缔结和平公约。世界和平理事会常务委员会斯德哥尔摩会议公报说：“和平运动几年以来所宣传的明白的真理和和平运动所支持的明智的事业已开始出现成果。新的情况已经形成，需要我们加倍努力。”许多事实说明，加倍努力争取各国人民之间的合作和友谊的号召已得到良好的反应。各社会阶层的正直的人们越来越多地参加到和平斗争中来了，他们在维也纳世界人民和平大会制定的纲领的基础上取得了一致。
    世界各国的舆论一致支持世界人民和平大会国际委员会写信给各国政府要求它们支持缔结五大国和平公约建议这一行动，资本主义国家的政府直到现在还没有答复这个建议。这种沉默是明显地处在与广泛的舆论对立的地位，因为舆论坚决主张采取有利于和平和国际安全的具体措施。
    各国的保卫和平委员会和一些包括各种不同政治信仰的人的社会团体，代表英国，法国，印度，芬兰，黎巴嫩，阿根廷，巴西以及其他一些国家的千百万普通人民，已经要求他们的政府促成和平公约的缔结。各国人民纷纷在反对和平敌人的阴谋，争取和平解决国际争端和发展国际合作的口号下举行和平大会和代表会议。美洲大陆文化大会对于进一步展开美洲大陆的和平运动具有重大的意义。在不久以前举行的全日本和平大会上，代表们说道：“我们要使日本由美国的军事基地变成和平的基地。”印度许多省所举行的保卫和平的群众集会和示威游行表明，和平运动在印度已经有全国性质了。在芬兰，从五月十日到十七日要举行和平周。在英国，五月十六日将召开全国和平行动大会，并已邀请一千五百名具有各种见解和信仰的代表参加。英国和平委员会已决定这次大会的目的：“为了使英国在争取国际和平和改善各国之间的关系上起有效的作用，大会应该找到一致的行动方式。”
    各种和平大会，代表大会和集会都表现了爱好和平的各国人民对最尖锐的国际问题的意见。全体进步人类都主张，继在朝鲜交换病伤战俘问题解决之后，能够全盘解决阻碍着朝鲜停战的一些其他问题。各国人民的这种意志是和和平解决朝鲜问题的公开的或隐秘的敌人的图谋相对立的，这些人现在仍然企图继续拖延朝鲜战争。
    德国问题是最重要的国际问题之一。世界和平理事会常务委员会的公报着重指出：“要维护和平，还需要四大国就德国问题举行谈判，以求得问题的和平解决。”解决德国问题需要考虑到德国所有邻国的切身利益和如何巩固欧洲和平，而首先必须考虑德国本国人民的愿望。大家都知道这些利益是什么，以及应用什么方法来公正地解决德国问题。这就是尽速缔结这样一个对德和约，这个和约要使德国人民可以建立一个统一的国家，并且能够在爱好和平的各国人民的合作中取得应有的地位。
    全世界善良的人都知道，现在有一种反动力量，直接或间接地阻止国际紧张局势的缓和。这种在美国特别嚣张的势力已在“和平的面前发抖”，这种恐惧是任何假装的爱好和平的词句无法掩饰的。事实上，大西洋集团的活动，一直没有任何迹象说明它在减缓军备竞赛或是减少这一集团在世界各地所建立的军事基地。在这种情况下，世界各国爱好和平的人们的任务就是：提高对和平敌人的阴谋的警惕，动员新的千百万人来保卫和平。这也就是六月十五日要在布达佩斯召开的世界和平理事会会议的任务。苏联人民坚定地致力于保卫和平事业，一致支持国际和平运动和关于缔结五大国和平公约的建议。共产党和苏联政府坚决认为：国际和平政策是符合各国人民切身利益的唯一正确和必须的政策。
