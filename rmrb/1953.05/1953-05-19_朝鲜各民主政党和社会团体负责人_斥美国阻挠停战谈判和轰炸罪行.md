Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 18th: Leaders of various democratic political parties and social organizations in North Korea have issued statements strongly condemning the U.S. aggressors' crimes of obstructing armistice negotiations and intensifying the bombing of peaceful towns and villages and peaceful facilities in North Korea.

Zheng Shengyan, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party, said: While refusing to accept our reasonable proposals in the armistice negotiations and stubbornly adhering to their absurd demands, the enemy is carrying out the atrocities of their so-called "military pressure," dispatching air force to bomb peaceful towns and villages and reservoirs in North Korea, killing many people. This has further strengthened the hatred of the entire Korean people towards U.S. imperialism and will make people all over the world more clearly aware of how inhuman U.S. imperialism is and how it is the mortal enemy of peace and reason.

Kim Dal-hyun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, said: This atrocity of the enemy is a planned provocative act to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, and we, together with all the people, once again express our indignation. We, as in the past, will never be subdued by any atrocities or so-called "military pressure" of the enemy, and will more bravely defeat the enemy.

Xu Hui, Vice Chairman of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, said: We, the entire Korean working class, express our infinite indignation at the continuous atrocities committed by the enemy. In 1952, despite the enemy's wanton bombing of power plants, we increased production to 119 percent of the 1951 level. In the future, the Korean working class will surely overcome any atrocities of the enemy and strive more actively to overfulfill the production plan and win victory. We will also do everything in our power to rescue the victims of the enemy's atrocities.

Xuan Qizhong, Vice Chairman of the Korean Farmers' League, said: Last year, the enemy bombed our irrigation facilities at the Shuifeng and other power plants. However, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, our entire peasantry's agricultural production reached 113 percent of the 1948 harvest. This year, under the enemy's mad bombing, the peasants also overfulfilled the sowing plan by 102.2 percent on April 30, ten days earlier than last year. The Korean peasants, together with all the people, will never tolerate such barbaric acts by the enemy. We will launch a more enthusiastic agricultural production increase movement with hatred for the enemy, and fight to the end to resolutely defend the freedom and independence of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 18th: The Korean people are overcoming the flood disaster caused by the U.S. aggressors' destruction of the Shunan-Pyongyang area reservoir with tenacious struggle. The Korean Workers' Party and the government immediately organized a rescue committee to carry out work such as providing relief to the victims, restoring damaged agriculture, and investigating the damage. The victims received relief grain and clothing and moved into state-supplied housing. Male and female repair team members and rescue team members are turning grief and anger into strength and are resolutely and calmly carrying out road and bridge repairs, burying corpses, and rescuing the wounded.

The atrocities of the U.S. aggressors cannot dampen the courage of the Korean people in the slightest. The Korean farmers affected by the disaster are filled with hatred for the enemy, and their determination to fight is even stronger. They unanimously stated that they will redouble their efforts to quickly restore the fields destroyed by the floods and replant the seeds in the ground. For example, the high-yield farmer Kim Je-se, whose more than 6,000 pyeong of farmland that he had deeply cultivated and carefully worked on last winter and this spring were completely destroyed by the enemy's atrocities, is still very strong and confident, saying: "Last year I harvested six tons of grain, and I plan to harvest 20 percent more than last year this year. Although the inhuman American bandits destroyed our reservoir, they cannot destroy our firm will. We have the leadership and care of the Workers' Party and the Republic government and the respected and beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung. There are no difficulties we cannot overcome. Any atrocity of the enemy can never subdue us. We must re-plow the fields washed away by the flood, plant millet and sorghum, and replant rice seedlings. We will dig another reservoir next to the fields to ensure that the rice fields are not affected by drought. I must complete the original plan and increase the harvest by 20 percent compared to last year."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 18th: After destroying the Shiyan Reservoir in the Shunan-Pyongyang area, the U.S. Air Force invading Korea dispatched more than 30 aircraft on the 16th to barbarously bomb the Jisan Reservoir in Shunchuan County, South Pyongan Province, continuing to create artificial floods.

After the resumption of the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. aggressors, while doing their best to obstruct the smooth progress of the Korean armistice negotiations in Panmunjom, intensified the bombing of peaceful towns and villages and destroyed peaceful facilities in North Korea. According to preliminary statistics, in more than a month from March 26 to May 12, the U.S. Air Force bombed eight cities and more than 100 villages in northern Korea, dropping more than 20,000 bombs and killing a large number of old people, women and children. On May 10, U.S. aircraft once again bombed the Shuifeng Power Plant.

    朝鲜各民主政党和社会团体负责人
    斥美国阻挠停战谈判和轰炸罪行
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜各民主政党和社会团体的负责人分别发表谈话，严正斥责美国侵略者阻挠停战谈判、加紧轰炸朝鲜和平城乡与和平设施的罪行。
    民主党中央委员会副委员长郑圣彦说：敌方一面在停战谈判中拒不接受我方的合理提案，固执其荒谬主张，阻碍停战谈判；一面又施行其所谓“军事压力”的暴行，派遣空军轰炸了朝鲜的和平城乡和贮水池，杀害了许多人民。这使全朝鲜人民进一步加强了对美帝国主义的仇恨，并将使全世界人民更加清楚地认识到美帝国主义是多么残无人道，是和平与理性的死敌。
    天道教青友党中央委员会委员长金达铉说：敌人的这种暴行是阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的有计划的挑衅行为，我们和全体人民一起再次表示激愤。我们和过去一样绝不为敌人的任何暴行与所谓“军事压力”所屈服，并将更加英勇地战胜敌人。
    朝鲜职业总同盟副委员长徐辉说：我们全朝鲜工人阶级对于敌人连续制造的暴行表示无限激愤。我们在一九五二年曾不顾敌人对发电厂的滥炸，把生产量提高到一九五一年的百分之一百一十九。今后，朝鲜工人阶级必将战胜敌人的任何暴行，为超额完成生产计划而更加积极地奋斗，争取胜利。我们并要尽一切力量来救援遭受敌人残害的灾民。
    朝鲜农民同盟副委员长玄七钟说：去年，敌人曾炸坏了我们的水丰等发电厂的灌溉设施。但是，我们全体农民在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确领导下，农业生产量达到一九四八年收获量的百分之一百一十三。今年，在敌人的疯狂轰炸之下，农民们也在四月三十日比去年提早十天超额完成了播种计划的百分之一百零二点二，朝鲜农民和全体人民一起绝不能容忍敌人的这种野蛮暴行，我们将以憎恨敌人的心情更加热烈地展开农业增产运动，为坚决保卫祖国的自由和独立而斗争到底。
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜人民正以顽强的斗争，来战胜美国侵略者在炸毁顺安—平原地区贮水池后所造成的洪水灾害。朝鲜劳动党和政府立即组织了救护委员会，进行救济灾民、恢复受损害的农业以及调查受害情况等工作。灾民们领到了救济粮食和衣物，并迁居到国家供给的住所中。男女抢修队员和救护队员们，化悲愤为力量，正坚毅沉着地进行着抢修道路桥梁、掩埋尸体、救护伤者等工作。
    美国侵略者的暴行丝毫不能挫折朝鲜人民的勇气。受灾害的朝鲜农民对敌人满怀仇恨，斗争的意志更加坚强。他们一致表示要加倍努力，迅速恢复被洪水冲毁的田地，重新把种籽播到地里去。例如丰产农民金济世，他在去冬今春深耕细作过的六千多坪田地全被敌人的暴行毁坏了，但是他依然十分坚强、十分有信心地说：“去年我收获了六吨谷子，我计划今年要比去年再多收百分之二十。丧尽人性的美国强盗虽然炸毁了我们的贮水池，却炸不毁我们的坚决斗志，我们有劳动党与共和国政府和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导和关怀，在我们面前没有克服不了的困难。敌人的任何暴行也永远不能使我们屈服。我们要把被洪水冲击了的田地重新犁过，种上小米和高粱，重新移植禾苗。我们要在田边再挖一个贮水池，保证稻田不致受旱，我一定要完成原订计划，比去年增收百分之二十。”
    【新华社平壤十八日电】侵朝美国空军在炸毁朝鲜顺安—平原地区的石岩贮水池以后，十六日又派遣三十多架飞机，野蛮地轰炸平安南道顺川郡的慈山贮水池，继续制造人工水灾。
    在朝鲜停战谈判恢复进行以后，美国侵略者一面在板门店竭力阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的顺利进行，一面又加紧轰炸朝鲜和平城乡，破坏朝鲜和平设施。据初步统计，从三月二十六日到五月十二日的一个多月中，美国空军曾轰炸了朝鲜北部八个城市和一百多个里，投下了二万多颗炸弹，杀害了大批老人、妇女和儿童。在五月十日，美机并曾再一次轰炸水丰发电厂。
