Leading Cadres Conduct In-depth Investigation and Research to Strengthen Leadership: Chengde County Achieves Great Success in Building Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects

Leading cadres of Chengde County, Rehe Province, conducted in-depth investigation and research and strengthened specific leadership over drought resistance work, achieving great success in building small-scale water conservancy projects this spring.

Chengde County is a region with many mountains and rivers, suitable for small-scale water conservancy and canal irrigation. However, in past drought resistance campaigns, due to bureaucratic leadership, work was not thorough, specific circumstances were not understood, and there were no concrete measures. Only general appeals were made for the masses to dig wells and water springs, without recognizing that canal irrigation was the fundamental solution to drought in the county. It was thought that canal irrigation projects were large-scale, and there were concerns that they would not be done well and would waste manpower and resources. Therefore, the locally available natural advantages were not used to serve agricultural production. Since this spring, the county party committee's arrangements for drought prevention and resistance have been based on the old approach. Later, as the drought became more severe, the county party committee conducted an in-depth investigation of canal construction projects in Shangtaizi, Shidongzi, and Wuchang villages in the Third District. The investigation proved that canal construction was better than digging wells. The Xiabancheng Canal is ten li long, using 2,500 labor days and irrigating 1,500 mu of land. In the past, within the area benefiting from this canal, digging one well, whether it was four zhang deep using 350 to 400 labor days, or two zhang deep using 150 to 200 labor days, each well could only irrigate 30 mu of land. If the average labor cost for each well was 250 days, the labor used for canal construction would only be enough to dig ten wells, irrigating 300 mu, only one-fifth of the area benefiting from canal construction. This led the county party committee to establish the guiding ideology of canal irrigation. At the same time, provincial party committee secretary Wang Guoquan inspected the canal construction projects in Shangtaizi and five other villages and instructed the county party committee to make good use of river water for irrigation, further strengthening their confidence in developing small-scale water conservancy. This was followed by a surge of canal construction throughout the county. The Shanzui Village Canal in the Third District was surveyed and planned early this spring. However, due to a lack of information from the leadership, it was estimated to require more than 1,000 labor days, and there were concerns that it would affect spring plowing, so action was not taken. After the leadership's thinking was straightened out, the masses were immediately mobilized, and the seven-li-long canal was completed in ten days, using 800 labor days. The Baihe Canal in the Fourth District can irrigate more than 3,000 mu of land in three villages. It had been planned to build it several years ago, but it was shelved year after year because some people said that there was not enough water. This time, the county party committee personally inspected the water volume at the canal's intake and visited local residents to learn that there was plenty of water, and that even during the most severe drought, it could still irrigate 200 mu of land per day. According to statistics from six of the eleven districts in the county, a total of 98 new canals of various sizes were built, irrigating more than 45,000 mu of land, accounting for 17 percent of the total land area of the six districts and 25 percent of the flat land. Together with wells, water springs, and the old canals, wells, and water springs, and with 30 percent of the land having sufficient moisture to germinate, the county was able to ensure timely sowing and complete germination on 70 percent of the land even without rain, basically overcoming this year's spring drought. At the same time, it is also a type of basic construction in agricultural production, expanding the area of irrigated land. For example, eight villages in the Third District, including Xiabancheng, newly dug eight dry canals, irrigating 6,380 mu of land, accounting for 36 percent of the total land of the eight villages and more than 50 percent of the flat land. Together with existing water sources, irrigation can reach 80 percent. Now, the county party committee is planning to further promote the construction of small-scale water conservancy on the existing basis, preparing to continue organizing the masses to dig canals on rivers with irrigation conditions after the end of spring plowing and after autumn, striving to basically overcome drought in areas with suitable conditions in two or three years.

    领导干部深入调查研究加强领导
    承德县兴修小型水利有很大成绩
    热河省承德县领导干部深入调查研究，加强对抗旱工作的具体领导，今春兴修小型水利有很大成绩。
    承德县是一个山多河流多的区域，适合搞小型水利，挖渠灌溉。但在历年来的抗旱运动中，由于领导上的官僚主义，工作不深入，不了解具体情况，没有确切的措施，只是一般化的号召群众打井挖水泉，没有认识到挖渠灌溉是该县抗旱的根本办法，以为挖渠灌溉工程大，怕搞不好会劳民伤财。因此，没有把当地的天然有利条件用来为农业生产服务。今春以来，县委布置防旱抗旱时仍是老一套的提法。后来干旱日趋严重，县委便深入地调查了三区上台子、石洞子、武场等村的修渠工程。调查的结果证明了修渠比打井强。下板城大渠全长十华里，用工二千五百个，灌溉土地一千五百亩。过去在此受益土地内打一眼井，深的四丈用工三百五十个到四百个，浅的二丈用工一百五十个到二百个。每眼井只能浇地三十亩，若以每眼井平均用工二百五十个，这次修渠工数只能打井十眼，浇地三百亩，只达修渠受益地亩的五分之一。由此县委便树立了修渠灌溉的领导思想。同时，省委书记王国权同志视察了上台子等五个村的修渠工程后，也指示县委要很好地利用河水灌溉，更坚定了搞小型水利的信心。接着便在全县掀起修渠热潮，三区山咀村大渠开春就勘测、计划，由于领导不摸底，估计用工一千多个，怕影响春耕生产，不敢动。这次搞通领导思想，立即发动群众，十天内便修好了七里长的大渠，用工八百个。四区白河大渠能灌溉三个村的三千余亩土地，几年以前就计划要修，只因为有人说水不够用，便一年一年搁置下来。这次县委亲自到渠的接水口视察水量并访问当地群众，才知道水很够用，就是在干旱最严重的时候每天还能灌溉二百亩地。据全县十一个区中六个区的统计，共修大小新渠九十八道，浇地四万五千多亩，占该六个区的总土地面积的百分之十七，占平地的百分之二十五。连同打井、挖水泉，再加旧有的渠、井、水泉和百分之三十的土地有墒能出苗，全县在不下雨的情况下，也能争取百分之七十的土地作到及时播种，出苗齐全，基本上战胜了今年的春旱。同时也是农业生产上的一种基本建设，扩大了水浇地面积。如三区下板城等八个村共新挖干渠八道，浇地六千三百八十亩，占该八个村总土地的百分之三十六，占平地的百分之五十以上，连同旧有水源，浇地能达到百分之八十。现在，县委正计划在现有基础上把兴修小型水利工作更向前推进一步，准备春耕结束后和秋后，继续在有灌溉条件的河流上，大力组织群众挖渠，争取二、三年内在有条件的地区基本战胜旱灾。    （中共承德县委书记  任志光）
