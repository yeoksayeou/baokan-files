    Red Flag Flying on "Old Baldy"
    Lian Yunshan

    Editor's Note: Hao Zhongyun, the heroic attack battalion commander of the Volunteer Army who was awarded the title of First Class Hero in the Shangpu Fangdongsanshan battle, has come to Beijing as part of the Volunteer Army's "May Day" National Day observation delegation. This dispatch is based on materials he provided. The photo above is of Battalion Commander Hao Zhongyun.

    March 23rd. In the third spring of the Korean War.

    On this day, the heroic Volunteer Army attack battalion commander Hao Zhongyun and his assault team were quietly waiting for the arrival of night in the tunnel of the assault departure point. - At that time, we would launch a powerful attack on the enemy's position on Shangpu Fangdongsanshan ("Old Baldy"); at that time, our fierce artillery fire would destroy the enemy's seven rows of barbed wire and nearly two hundred steel-plated bunkers, and eliminate the more than four hundred enemies stubbornly resisting in the bunkers; at that time, we would seize this commanding height, which was embedded between the two highlands of the enemy's main position, and turn it into a sharp blade inserted into the enemy's heart.

    The battalion commander and all the commanders and fighters in the battalion felt that it was a great honor for their superiors to entrust them with this important task. In order to ensure the victory of the battle, the entire battalion made thorough battle preparations. The battalion commander personally participated in the on-site reconnaissance of the enemy's position, participated in the formulation of a detailed infantry-artillery coordinated attack plan, and all the commanders and fighters carried out intensive combat exercises. Letters of determination were continuously sent from each squad to the company, battalion, and regiment. When the leaders presented the red flag to them, flag bearers Tian Shunhua, Qin Zunqiu, and Zhang Tingxiao solemnly signed their names on the red flag and solemnly swore: "We will definitely plant the red flag on 'Old Baldy'."

    Everyone was waiting... It was finally dark. The battalion commander went to each tunnel in order, shook hands cordially with the company commanders and instructors of each company, and briefly and forcefully instructed them: "Fight well, according to plan! For victory." The commanders and fighters unanimously and decisively replied: "Rest assured, Battalion Commander! For the motherland, for ourselves, we will resolutely complete the task and strive for greater glory!"

    This was the most tense moment: when the second hand on the battalion commander's watch just jumped to 7:55, at the instant the order for "Artillery Raid! Begin!" was issued, hundreds of artillery pieces roared together, and shells, carrying huge whistling sounds, flew towards the enemy's position, immediately exploding into a sea of fire on the enemy's position. The soldiers couldn't help but shout: "Well done!"

    "Charge!" At the scheduled time, the battalion commander issued the order. The soldiers in each tunnel, like fierce tigers, rushed out of the tunnel openings and charged straight towards the enemy's position along the road they had studied on the sand table before the battle. The enemy's blocking artillery fire could not stop the soldiers' heroic charge, and the enemy's forward position was captured in just four minutes.

    "Artillery Extend!" The battalion commander continued to issue orders. Powerful artillery fire immediately bombarded the flanks and rear of the enemy's position. Immediately afterwards, the battalion commander led the soldiers, stepping over the area just bombarded by our artillery fire, and charged towards the main peak. Demolition team leader Teng Mingguo and three team members rushed to the front. They crossed the barbed wire destroyed by our artillery fire and rushed up like lightning. One, two, three, four, five, six, suddenly, the seventh row of barbed wire, also the last row of barbed wire, blocked the way. "Demolish!" Just as the four of them were about to ignite the demolition charge, the third platoon leader also rushed up with the assault team. At this time, if the charge was ignited, the explosion of the demolition charge might cause casualties to our own assault team. If the assault team retreated slightly, it might lose the opportunity and affect the victory of the entire battle. At this tense moment, Teng Mingguo shouted, "For victory, we can't hesitate!" and jumped onto the barbed wire, waving his right hand commandingly and powerfully, telling the platoon leader and the assault team to pass over him. Almost at the same time, demolition team members Li Gaobiao, Wu Erhua, and Zhang Fuyang also pressed their bodies on the barbed wire. The third platoon leader instinctively shouted: "Get up and demolish!" However, for the victory of the entire battle, he could not hesitate in the slightest at this moment. So he shouted, "Learn from the great spirit of the demolition team, charge up!" and leaped over Teng Mingguo's body. The soldiers all excitedly shouted, "Long live the demolition team!" Stepping over the bodies of their comrades, they charged towards the main peak like a gust of wind. On the way to the main peak, flag bearer Tian Shunhua was wounded and fell. Qin Zunqiu picked up the red flag and continued to advance. When approaching the main peak, Qin Zunqiu was shot again and fell. Zhang Tingxiao caught up a few steps, raised the red flag, and continued to advance. Then, Zhang Tingxiao was also wounded in the chest. He endured the great pain and rushed to the main peak, finally planting the red flag on the top of "Old Baldy." Zhang Tingxiao turned his head and looked around. At this time, troops from all directions were also successively attacking. At the same time, the battalion commander also rushed to the top of the mountain. The main peak of "Old Baldy" was captured by us!

    The battalion commander looked at his watch. Only fifteen minutes had passed from the beginning of the charge to now.

    The first step of the battle had been won, but the battle was not over. It was necessary to continue to wipe out the remnants of the enemy on both sides and occupy the positions on both sides in order to finally consolidate the main peak position.

    The battalion commander immediately reported this encouraging news to his superiors and directed the troops to quickly attack both sides. At this moment, the enemy's artillery fire on the mountain on the right fiercely bombarded here, trying to suppress the activities of our troops and cover their counterattack. "Artillery Raid!" One minute after the battalion commander's order was transmitted to our artillery group, our powerful artillery fire immediately silenced the enemy's position. The battle continued smoothly towards both sides.

    At the ridge that the third company commander Li Zhitang charged to, the enemy lurking in the mountainside suddenly drilled out of the bunker. Taking advantage of the fact that our soldiers had not yet gained a foothold, they counterattacked; however, they were immediately beaten back by the soldiers commanded by Company Commander Li. The third time, the enemy increased to a platoon and surged up to counterattack. Soldier Song Deqing threw a grenade, but unexpectedly it did not hit. He said angrily: "Company Commander, as long as I'm here, they won't get through!" As he said that, he held a demolition charge and jumped into the enemy group. As the demolition charge exploded, more than thirty enemies were destroyed. We gained time and consolidated the position. But our Comrade Song Deqing also heroically sacrificed.

    In the attack on the enemy's position on the right, rocket launcher Li Haigui, after destroying eighteen enemy bunkers in a row, turned around and saw two enemy tanks rumbling towards the position we were about to occupy. He immediately fired and destroyed the two tanks. Soldier Xiao Hanchen went into the cave where the enemy company headquarters was located to search. Only the company commander of the Colombian mercenary army had not died here. This guy saw Xiao Hanchen rushing in, raised his submachine gun and fired a burst of bullets at Xiao Hanchen. Xiao Hanchen was hit by three bullets in the shoulder, but endured the pain and angrily pounced on this guy, scaring him to run back into the cave. Xiao Hanchen also followed closely behind. He suddenly turned around and stabbed Xiao Hanchen in the stomach with a bayonet. With a "click" sound, the bayonet stabbed into Xiao Hanchen's ammunition disk. He saw that there was only Xiao Hanchen, so he released the gun and pressed Xiao Hanchen, who was bleeding too much, to the ground. Xiao Hanchen wanted to struggle but had no strength, touched the muzzle of the gun, how happy! The muzzle was facing this guy's stomach, a fire, a string of bullets ended the life of this Colombian mercenary soldier! Xiao Hanchen killed this guy, walked out of the cave, and happened to see an enemy heavy tank rumbling down the mountain to escape. He threw a grenade at it. As the grenade exploded, the tank immediately burst into flames and was destroyed.

    While the battles on both sides were going on fiercely, more than a hundred American soldiers, under the cover of two or three tanks, shouted and counterattacked towards the main peak. "To ××, Artillery Raid!" As soon as the battalion commander's order was issued, our powerful artillery fire turned the place where the enemy was shouting and charging into a sea of fire. From then on, the enemy was no longer able to counterattack.

    At this time, the battle for the 15th position on the left was still going on fiercely. Machine gunner Jin Zhenbiao was wounded in both legs. He crawled to the enemy's position, fired two hundred rounds of bullets in one breath, defeated the enemy's stubborn resistance, and occupied the position. On the way to the attack, Company Commander Li Zhitang was seriously injured in the abdomen, and his intestines flowed out, but this strong man gritted his teeth and pressed his intestines back into his stomach with his hands, and continued to direct the troops to attack Highland 15. "Take down 15!" "Take down 15!" Until he fell into a coma, he stopped his rapid orders. The medic who was guarding Company Commander's side, heard cheers rising from Highland 15, excitedly and regretfully shouted to the Company Commander who had passed out: "Company Commander, 15 has been taken!" These words immediately awakened the Company Commander, the Company Commander opened his eyes, showing a smile, struggling to get up, but he had exhausted all his strength, and could no longer move, only to hear him say: "Good! Our mission is complete..." The voice gradually weakened, and this strong man finally closed his eyes.

    When the battalion commander's second hand pointed to 8:55, the remnants of the enemy in all places had been almost completely wiped out, and the position had been consolidated. Two minutes later, our reserve troops could be put into battle. "Old Baldy" already belongs to us. The battalion commander looked at his watch and calculated the time: it had only been an hour from the start of the battle to now. In front of him, the flares illuminated the top of the mountain, and a bright red flag was victoriously flying. (Attached picture)

    红旗飘扬在“老秃山”上
    连云山
    编者按：上浦防东山战斗中荣膺一等功臣称号的志愿军攻击营营长郝忠云，这次参加了志愿军“五一”节归国观礼代表团来到北京。这篇通讯就是根据他所谈的材料写成的。文前照片就是郝忠云营长。
    三月二十三日。在朝鲜战争的第三个春天里。
    这一天，英雄的志愿军攻击营营长郝忠云和他的突击队，在冲锋出发地的坑道里，静静地等待着夜晚的到来。——那时，我们将要对上浦防东山（“老秃山”）敌军阵地发起强大的攻击；那时，我们的猛烈的炮火，将要摧毁敌人的七道铁丝网和将近二百个钢板地堡，消灭躲在地堡里顽抗的四百多个敌人；那时，我们将要把这个嵌在敌人主阵地的两个高地之间的制高点夺过来，把它变为插入敌人心脏的一把利刃。
    营长和全营指战员们都感到，上级把这个重大的任务交给自己是极大的荣誉。为了保证战斗的胜利，全营进行了周密的作战准备，营长亲自参加了敌人阵地的实地侦察，参加制定了详细的步炮协同的进攻计划，全体指战员都作了紧张的作战练习。决心书不断地从各个班里送到连里、营里和团里去。当首长把红旗授给他们的时候，红旗手田顺华、覃尊秋和张庭孝，郑重地在红旗上签上了自己的名字，并且庄严地宣誓：“我们一定把红旗插到‘老秃山’上。”
    大家等待着……好容易天黑了。营长顺序来到各个坑道里，和各连连长、指导员亲切地握了手，并且简短有力地嘱咐他们：“要打好，按计划！为了胜利。”指战员们一致斩钉截铁地回答：“请放心，营长！为祖国，为自己，我们坚决完成任务，争取更大荣誉！”
    这是一个最紧张的时刻：当营长表上的秒针刚刚跳上七点五十五分，“炮火急袭！开始！”的口令下达的一瞬间，百十门大炮一齐发出轰鸣，炮弹带着巨大的啸声，飞向敌人的阵地，立刻在敌人的阵地爆炸成一片火海。战士们忍不住地叫起来：“打得好！”
    “冲锋！”到了预定时间，营长发出了命令。各个坑道里的战士们，猛虎一般地冲出洞口，沿着战斗前在沙盘上研究过的道路，直向敌人的阵地冲去。敌人的拦阻炮火，挡不住战士们的英勇冲锋，仅仅四分钟的时间，敌人的前沿阵地就被攻占了。
    “炮火延伸！”营长继续发出命令。强大的炮火，立刻轰向敌人阵地的两侧和背后。紧接着，营长带领着战士们，踏过刚才炮火轰击的地区，向主峰冲去。爆破组长滕明国和三个组员冲在最前面。他们越过被我方炮火摧毁的铁丝网，飞也似地冲了上去，一道、两道、三道、四道、五道、六道，突然，第七道铁丝网，也是最后一道铁丝网挡住了去路。“爆破！”正当他们四个按上爆破筒就要拉火的时候，三排长带着突击队也冲了上来，这时如果拉火，爆破筒爆炸了，就可能给自己的突击队造成伤亡，如果要突击队后退一下，又可能丧失战机，影响整个战斗的胜利。就在这紧张的一刹间，滕明国一边喊着：“为了胜利，不能犹豫！”一边就跃身爬到铁丝网上，把右手命令似地有力地一挥，要排长和突击队在他身上通过。几乎同时，爆破组组员李高标、吴二华和张富扬也把身子压在铁丝网上。三排长本能地喊道：“快起来爆破！”但是，为了整个战斗的胜利，又使他此时此际不能有丝毫犹豫。于是他一边喊着：“学习爆破组的伟大精神，冲上去啊！”一边就从滕明国的身上一跃而过。战士们个个激动地高呼着“爆破组万岁！”从战友们身上踏过，一阵风似地向主峰冲去。在冲向主峰的路上，红旗手田顺华负伤倒下了，覃尊秋拿起红旗，继续前进。在接近主峰的时候，覃尊秋身上又中了子弹，倒下了，张庭孝赶上几步，举起红旗，继续前进。接着，张庭孝的胸上也负了伤，他忍着巨痛冲上了主峰，终于把红旗插上了“老秃山”顶。张庭孝回过头来看了看，这时，各路部队也陆续攻上来了，同时营长也冲到了山顶。“老秃山”主峰被我们攻占了！
    营长看了看表，从开始冲锋到现在，只过了十五分钟。
    战斗取得了第一步的胜利，但是战斗并没有结束，还需要继续肃清两侧残敌，占领两侧阵地，以便最后巩固主峰阵地。
    营长立刻向首长报告这个令人鼓舞的消息，并且指挥部队迅速地向两侧攻打。就在这个时候，右侧山上敌人的炮火，向这里猛烈地打来，想压制我们部队的活动，掩护反扑。“炮火急袭！”营长的命令传到我炮兵群的一分钟后，我们强大的炮火立刻把敌人的阵地轰得静寂无声。战斗才顺利地继续向两侧推进。
    在三连长李志棠冲到的那个山脊，山腰里潜伏的敌人，突然从地堡里钻出来，趁着我们的战士立脚未稳，就反扑上来；可是，立刻就被李连长指挥的战士们打下去了。第三次敌人增加到一个排汹涌地反扑上来。战士宋德清打出一个手雷，但想不到没有打中。他愤怒地说：“连长，有我在就没有他们！”说着，就抱着爆破筒，奋身跃入敌群，随着爆破筒的爆炸，三十多个敌人毁灭了。我们取得了时间，巩固了阵地。但是我们的宋德清同志也壮烈牺牲了。
    在向右侧敌人阵地的攻击中，火箭筒射手李海贵，在接连摧毁敌人十八个地堡以后，转过身来，看到敌人的两辆坦克轰轰地向我们将要攻占的阵地压过来，他立刻发炮，把这两辆坦克摧毁了。战士萧汉臣打进敌人连部所在的洞里去搜索，这里的哥伦比亚帮凶军只有个连长还没有死。这个家伙看到萧汉臣冲了进来，就端起冲锋枪对着萧汉臣打了一梭子子弹，萧汉臣肩上中了三颗子弹，但却忍着痛愤怒地向这个家伙扑去，吓得他返身就往洞里跑，萧汉臣也紧跟着追了进去，他忽然转身用刺刀向萧汉臣的肚子猛戳过来，“卡嚓”一声，刺刀戳在萧汉臣的弹盘上。他看到来的只有萧汉臣一个，就撒开枪把流血过多的萧汉臣按在地上，萧汉臣想扎挣但已没有力气，摸了下枪口，好高兴啊！枪口正对着这个家伙的肚子，一发火，一串子弹就结束这个哥伦比亚帮凶兵的性命！萧汉臣打死了这个家伙，走出洞来，正巧看到一辆敌人的重型坦克轰轰地向山下逃跑，他顺手扔去一个手雷，随着手雷的爆炸，这辆坦克立刻燃起了熊熊的火焰，毁灭了。
    当两侧的战斗正在激烈进行的时候，一百多名美国兵，在两、三辆坦克的掩护下，叫喊着向主峰反扑上来。“向××，炮火急袭！”营长的命令刚刚发出去，我们的强大的炮火就把敌人叫喊冲锋的那个地方打成一片火海。从此，敌人再也无力反扑了。
    这时，争夺左侧十五号阵地的战斗还在激烈地进行着。机枪射手金镇彪，两腿负了伤，他爬着打到敌人的阵地，一口气打出了二百发子弹，打垮了敌人的顽抗，占领了阵地。在进攻的途中，连长李志棠腹部负了重伤，肠子流了出来，但是这个坚强的人，咬着牙用手把肠子按进肚子里，继续指挥部队向十五号高地攻去。“打下十五号！”“打下十五号！”直到昏迷过去，他才停止了声调急促的命令。守在连长身边的卫生员，听到十五号高地上腾起
    一片欢呼，兴奋地又似惋惜地对着昏迷过去的连长喊道：“连长，十五号打下来了！”这几个字立刻把连长唤醒过来，连长睁开眼睛，露出微笑，挣扎着要起来，但他已经使尽了全部力气，再也不能动 一动，只听得他在说：“好！我们的任务完成了……”声音逐渐微弱下去，这位坚强的人最后闭上了他的眼睛。
    当营长的秒针指到八点五十五分的时候，各处残敌已经差不多完全肃清，阵地也已经巩固了。两分钟后，我们的预备部队就可以投入战斗。“老秃山”已属于我们的了。营长看着表，计算了一下时间：从发起战斗到现在，一共只经过一个钟头。在他的面前，照明弹照得山头通明，一面鲜艳的红旗胜利地飘扬着。（附图片）
