    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Introduction to the Chinese Edition of Issue No. 17, 1953

    The Chinese edition of Issue No. 17, 1953, of the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

    To welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day, this issue published an editorial entitled "The Noble Mission of the Communist and Workers' Parties." The editorial pointed out: The Communist and Workers' Parties, which take the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin as the foundation of their activities, are a great force driving mankind forward. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union enjoys the highest prestige and exerts extremely great influence in the international revolutionary movement and the workers' movement. All Communist and Workers' Parties follow the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and learn from its rich experience and combat traditions. In the People's Democratic countries, the Communist and Workers' Parties are the inspiring and leading forces in the struggle to lay the foundations of socialism. The tasks they shoulder require them to greatly improve their work level, correctly combine political and economic work, bring party organizations and the masses closer together, and attract the working people to participate in construction work on a larger scale. In capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, the Communist parties must devote their main efforts to strengthening political and organizational work in enterprises, must link the struggle to achieve current demands with the struggle for peace, national independence, and the defense of democratic freedoms, and must explain to the workers the essence of the party's policies and the party's ultimate goals.

    Important articles published in this issue include "Striving for the Establishment of a Government in Italy that Upholds Peace and Implements Social Reforms" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, "On the Economic Situation in West Germany" by Walter Ulbricht, Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, and "The Tito Fascist Constitution Tramples on Jurisprudence and Upholds Colonial Oppression" written by Zygmunt Modzelewski, Member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

    Togliatti's article is a summary of his report at the National Congress of the Italian Communist Party on April 15. This report analyzed the domestic and international political situation on the eve of the Italian parliamentary elections scheduled for June 7, and put forward the main parts of the Communist Party's election program. He pointed out: The Italian parliamentary elections are related to the issue of peace and war, and to the life and death of the Italian nation and the democratic system won by the Italian nation. Under the current domestic and international situation, the Italian Communists demand a government that supports peace, a government that becomes an active factor in easing international tensions and establishing international peaceful relations. The Italian Communists not only demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, the conclusion of peace treaties by the major powers, the end of the "Cold War," and the striving for the establishment of lasting peaceful relations between countries, but also demand an end to the reactionary policies at home that trample on the Constitution of the Republic and deprive the people of their rights. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to shatter the political monopoly of the Christian Democratic Party headed by Gasperi, and it is necessary to use all forces in this parliamentary election to prevent this party and its servants from winning more than half of the votes.

    Ulbricht's article uses concrete figures to illustrate the economic situation in West Germany: on the one hand, the profits of monopoly capitalists, especially American monopoly capitalists, are rising rapidly; on the other hand, the living conditions of the working people in West Germany are deteriorating. Ulbricht also pointed out that the German imperialists, revived with the support of the occupying countries, are not only intensifying the exploitation of the working people in West Germany, but also using every opportunity to try to re-participate in plundering the people of other countries. The right-wing leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party - the frantic accomplices of imperialism - actually support this policy of plundering the people of other countries. The article concludes by pointing out that in order to eliminate the intolerable situation created by the imperialists and their accomplices for the people of West Germany, the German Communists must unite all the patriots of West Germany to fight against the Adenauer regime, and at the same time must constantly, systematically, and better than in the past, expose the absurd theories and policies of the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party.

    Modzelewski's article exposes the reactionary essence of the new constitution forcibly implemented by the Yugoslav Tito ruling clique in January of this year. He pointed out that this new constitution tramples on the democratic principles of the Yugoslav constitution passed during the mass revolutionary upsurge of 1946 and tramples on the rights of the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia. But neither the bloody police rule nor the deceptive Tito constitution can suppress the anger of the Yugoslav people, who are becoming more and more courageous and active in the struggle against the Tito executioners.

    This issue published the news of the publication of Volume III of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in Beijing in the column "Party Life of the Communist and Workers' Parties."

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第十七期中文版介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第十七期中文版已经出版。
    本期为迎接“五一”国际劳动节，发表了题为“共产党和工人党的崇高使命”的社论。社论指出：以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说作为活动基础的共产党和工人党，是推动人类前进的伟大力量。苏联共产党在国际革命运动和工人阶级运动中享有最高的威望，发生极其伟大的影响。一切共产党和工人党都效法苏联共产党的榜样，学习它的丰富经验和战斗传统。在人民民主国家中，共产党和工人党是在奠定社会主义基础的斗争中的鼓舞力量和领导力量，它们所担负的任务要求它们大大提高自己的工作水平，把政治工作和经济工作正确地结合起来，使党组织和群众的联系更加密切，更大规模地吸引劳动人民参加建设工作。在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的共产主义政党，必须把主要力量用来加强企业中的政治工作和组织工作，必须把争取实现当前要求的斗争同争取和平、争取民族独立和保卫民主自由的斗争联系起来，必须向工人们解释党的政策的实质和党的最终目的。
    本期刊载的重要文章有意大利共产党总书记帕·陶里亚蒂的“争取在意大利成立维护和平和实行社会改革的政府”，德国共产党中央委员会书记处书记瓦·波特的“论西德的经济状况”，波兰统一工人党中央委员会委员泽·莫杰莱夫斯基撰写的“践踏法理和维护殖民压迫的铁托法西斯宪法”。
    陶里亚蒂的文章是四月十五日他在意大利共产党全国代表大会上所作的报告的摘要。这个报告分析了定于六月七日举行的意大利议会选举前夕的国内外政治形势，并提出了共产党竞选纲领的主要部分。他指出：意大利的议会选举，关涉着和平与战争的问题，关涉着意大利民族和意大利民族所赢得的民主制度的生死存亡的问题。在目前的国内外形势下，意大利的共产党人要求一个拥护和平的政府，要求一个在缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际和平关系方面成为积极因素的政府。意大利共产党人不仅要求禁止原子武器、各大国缔结和平公约、结束“冷战”、争取各国间建立持久的和平关系，而且要求在国内结束践踏共和国宪法剥夺人民权利的反动政策。为了实现这种目标，必须粉碎以加斯贝利为首的天主教民主党的政治垄断，必须在这次议会选举中用一切力量使这个政党及其奴仆们不再获得过半数的选票。
    波特的文章用具体的数字说明西德的经济状况：一方面是垄断资本家特别是美国垄断资本家的利润飞速上升，另一方面是西德劳动人民的生活情况日益恶化。波特还指出，在占领国扶植下复活的德帝国主义者，不仅加紧剥削西德劳动人民，而且利用一切机会企图重新参加掠夺其他国家的人民。西德社会民主党的右翼头子们——帝国主义的丧心病狂的同谋者，竟然支持这种掠夺他国人民的政策。文章最后指出，要消除帝国主义者及其同谋犯为西德人民所造成的不可忍受的境况，西德共产党人必须团结西德的一切爱国者起来和阿登纳政权进行斗争，同时还必须经常地、有系统地、比过去更好地揭露社会民主党右翼头子们的荒谬理论和政策。
    莫杰莱夫斯基的文章揭露南斯拉夫铁托统治集团今年一月强制实施的新宪法的反动本质。他指出，这个新宪法践踏了一九四六年群众革命高潮时通过的南斯拉夫宪法的民主原则，蹂躏着南斯拉夫各族人民的权利。但是不管是血腥的警察统治，还是骗人的铁托宪法，都压制不住南斯拉夫人民的愤怒，他们在反铁托刽子手的斗争中，愈来愈勇敢和积极了。
    本期在“共产党和工人党党内生活”栏中刊载了毛泽东选集第三卷在北京出版的消息。    （新华社）
