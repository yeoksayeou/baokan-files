After revising the 1953 production plan, the Tangshan Power Plant made full preparations and formulated an advanced, comprehensive, technically and organizationally guaranteed, and feasible annual production, technology, and finance plan.

The Tangshan Power Plant initially drafted its 1953 production plan in December last year. This plan was primarily based on some written statistical data, and therefore had many shortcomings. From February to April this year, the plant launched a mass revision of the plan. Before revising the plan, they conducted a serious investigation, discovered many problems in production, and formulated twenty new systems related to safe operation and operating procedures, and twenty-nine technical norms related to technical management. During the investigation, the awareness of the workers was raised through education based on facts, and leading cadres also gained a thorough understanding of the main production workshops, which created extremely favorable conditions for revising the plan.

In order to conduct the plan revision work with better leadership, the plant drafted an advanced and comprehensive draft as a guide for mass discussion of the plan before the discussion, embodying the correct intentions of the leadership in the draft. To draft this plan, the leadership organized eight drafting groups, mainly composed of business departments and involving relevant personnel. Each group, based on the national plan and combined with specific circumstances, compiled various indicators and guarantee measures. Then, leading cadres absorbed the heads of each drafting group, and reviewed the plan specifically from a comprehensive point of view and in a spirit of seeking truth from facts. During the review, it was found that many parts of the draft expressed conservative ideas and had many problems. The leading cadres then convened various professional meetings (including engineers, workshop directors, section chiefs, accountants, and accounting personnel) to展开 a discussion and conduct scientific experiments or on-site experiments; the leading cadres also found workers for discussions to get to the bottom of the situation. After many such works, the correct basis for stipulating various indicators was finally found, and the conservative thinking in the original draft was criticized with concrete facts. For example, the capital construction expenses were compressed by 800 million yuan after discussion compared to the original plan draft. The original draft for spare parts for the turbine workshop required 540 million yuan, but after repeated calculations by everyone, it was compressed to 480 million yuan, saving 60 million yuan compared to the original budget. The coal consumption indicators, after repeated verification and analysis of the calorific value of the coal, finally confirmed a figure with a scientific and technical basis. As for plant electricity consumption, in the past it was calculated using a lump-sum method, but this time it was calculated separately by each workshop, and the electricity consumption of each machine was calculated. This extensive discussion made the drafting of the plan basically consistent with reality; and the process of drafting the plan was also an educational process of criticizing various conservative and backward ideas among middle-level cadres and establishing correct viewpoints.

When the discussion of the plan was about to begin, the plant carried out full political work among all employees. At that time, it was during the death of Comrade Stalin. At the memorial service held throughout the factory, the leadership put forward the slogan "Turn grief into strength" and "Use strength to revise the plan," guiding the emotions of the masses to work hard to revise the plan. Yan Dakai, the Second Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to the factory to make a mobilization report on the revision of the plan to all the staff. Everyone organized discussions and studies based on this report, and mass criticism and self-criticism were vigorously carried out, forming a wave of opposition to backwardness and striving for advancement among the masses. Workers actively put forward various suggestions for improving work. For example, Liu Chengqing, a fly ash worker, took the initiative to propose suggestions for streamlining the organization and saving manpower in his group, which resulted in the reduction of eight people, who were assigned to other jobs. The masses generally expressed: We must make an advanced plan and guarantee the realization of the plan. On the basis of initially mobilizing the masses, the plant further specifically pointed out the goals of efforts to the masses. While announcing the main indicators of the plan and mobilizing the masses to universally discuss the plan, various methods were used to promote various advanced models of comprehensive significance to the entire plant. As early as before mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, the plant had planned to cultivate three typical groups: one was the Zhang Lantang group in the turbine workshop, which solved key problems; one was the Liu Wu group in the boiler workshop, which overcame departmentalism, established an overall concept, and consciously implemented the Zhendarova work method; and one was the Zhu Yongcheng group in the electrical workshop, which carried out ideological criticism, overcame conservative complacency, and improved group unity. After the masses were further mobilized, a large number of advanced models emerged. Such as the Li Xiushan group in the turbine workshop, which criticized formalism in planning empty clauses and opposed conservative ideas. The leading cadres summarized the advanced experience of these groups in a timely manner and vigorously promoted it, which greatly promoted the mass movement of finding tricks, tapping potential, and making rationalization proposals, pushing the revision of the plan to a higher stage. According to incomplete statistics, the masses put forward a total of 592 rationalization proposals, of which more than 400 could be implemented. After the specific help of leading cadres and technical personnel, most of these suggestions and tricks rose to become technical and organizational measures and were incorporated into the workshop group plan.

The Tangshan Power Plant's plan revision work has the following advantages because of the careful preparations made in advance and the step-by-step implementation: First, various indicators have been improved. Power generation increased by 0.84% compared with last year, power transmission increased by 6.13% compared with last year, and savings in working capital, reduction of major capital construction funds, and disposal of stagnant equipment reached 4.32 billion yuan. Second, the plan is not only advanced, but also comprehensive. The content of the plan not only pays attention to production and safety, but also pays attention to economy and efficiency, making production and financial costs closely integrated. Under the general premise of "facing production and serving production," the management department also improved the material supply and warehouse management systems, and proposed that materials be delivered to the workshop, which strengthened the connection with the production workshop. Third, in order to achieve these advanced indicators in the plan, they also formulated a series of technical and organizational measures. A total of eight specific measures were formulated at the plant level; workshops and groups formulated a series of specific technical and organizational guarantee measures around various task indicators. The machine, electrical, boiler, and repair workshops improved and formulated 42 kinds of systems and operating procedures, systematically consolidated and promoted 15 kinds of advanced experiences, and each group up to each employee (including the management department) also formulated specific guarantee plans for groups and individuals. Through collective contracts, the Party, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, and all employees united their thoughts and actions under the overall goal of "ensuring safe and economic power generation throughout the year and comprehensively completing the national plan." Now, the Tangshan Power Plant is stepping up its efforts to make meticulous operation plans, completely changing the phenomenon that the management department lags behind production; and continue to strengthen various tasks to prevent any slack phenomenon in the implementation of the plan and ensure the timely and comprehensive completion of the plan.

    唐山发电厂修订生产计划后各项指标提高
    唐山发电厂在修订一九五三年生产计划的工作中，进行了充分的准备工作，已订出了先进的、全面的、有技术组织措施保证的、切实可行的全年生产技术财务计划。
    唐山发电厂在去年十二月就初步编制了一九五三年的生产计划。这个计划基本上是根据一些书面的统计资料编制成的，因此有很多缺点。今年二月到四月间，该厂便展开了群众性的修订计划的工作。在修订计划之前，他们曾认真地进行了查定工作，发现了生产中间的许多问题，分别订出了二十项有关安全运行、操作规程的新制度，和二十九项有关技术管理方面的技术定额。在查定中，通过事实对职工进行教育，提高了群众的觉悟，领导干部对主要生产车间也摸到了底，这就给修订计划创造了极有利的条件。
    为了使修订计划工作更有领导地进行，该厂在讨论计划以前就拟出了一个作为指导群众讨论计划的先进的全面的草案，把领导方面的正确意图体现在草案上。为起草这个草案，领导方面组织了以业务部门为主、吸收有关人员参加的八个起草小组。各小组根据国家计划，结合具体情况，编制出了各项指标及保证措施，接着领导干部吸收各起草小组负责人，以全面观点和实事求是的精神，具体地进行审查，审查中发现草案中有许多地方表现了保守思想，问题很多。领导干部便召开各种专业会议（包括工程师、车间主任、股长、会计人员、核算人员）展开讨论，进行科学试验或现场实验；领导干部又找工人座谈，深入下层摸底。经过这样的许多工作，终于找出规定各项指标的正确根据，以具体事实批判了原草案中的保守思想。如大维工程费用在讨论以后比原计划草案压缩了八亿元。汽机车间零星备件原草案上要五亿四千万元，但经过大家反复计算以后，压缩到四亿八千万元，比原预算节约了六千万元。煤耗指标经过反复核算和煤发热量的化验后，最后也肯定了一个有科学技术根据的数字。又如厂用电，过去是用一揽子的计算方法，这次则由各车间分别计算，并计算出每一机器的耗电量。这种广泛的讨论，就使草案的编制基本上和实际相符合；而这样编制计划草案的过程，同时也是批判中层干部中各种保守落后思想和树立正确观点的教育过程。
    在讨论计划工作将开始时，该厂在全体职工中进行了充分的政治工作。当时正值斯大林同志逝世，全厂举行的追悼大会上，领导方面提出了“化悲痛为力量”“把力量运用到修订计划工作中去”的口号，把群众情绪引导到努力修订计划上来。中共唐山市委第二书记阎达开又来厂对全体职工作了修订计划工作的动员报告，大家以此组织讨论学习，群众性的批评和自我批评蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来，在群众中形成了反对落后争取先进的热潮。工人们纷纷提出各种改进工作的建议，如推灰工人刘澄清主动提出在本组精简组织节约人力的建议，结果就减去了八人，给他们另行分配工作。群众普遍表示：一定要订出先进计划，并且保证实现计划。在初步发动群众的基础上，该厂又进一步具体地给群众指出努力的目标，在宣布计划各项主要指标，发动群众普遍讨论计划的同时，运用各种方式推广对全厂具有全面意义的各种先进典型。早在发动群众讨论计划之前，该厂就曾有计划地培养了三个典型小组：一个是汽机车间张兰堂小组解决关键问题的典型；一个是锅炉车间刘武小组克服本位主义，树立整体观念自觉推行真达罗娃工作方法的典型；一个是电气车间朱永成小组开展思想批判、克服保守自满思想搞好小组团结的典型。群众进一步发动起来之后，先进的典型又大量涌现出来。如批判订计划中拼凑空洞条文的形式主义和反对保守思想的汽机车间李秀山小组。领导干部及时地总结了这些小组的先进经验，并大力推广，结果又大大地推动了群众性的找窍门、挖潜力、提合理化建议运动，把修订计划工作推到更高阶段。据不完全的统计，群众共提出合理化建议五百九十二件，可以实行的有四百多件，这些建议、窍门经过领导干部和技术人员的具体帮助，绝大部分上升成为技术组织措施，订入车间小组计划。
    唐山发电厂的修订计划工作，因为事先作了细密的准备工作，有步骤地进行，使得计划具有如下优点：一、各项指标都提高了。发电量比去年提高了百分之零点八四，输电量比去年提高了百分之六点
    一三，节约流动资金、削减大维工程资金、处理呆滞器材三方面即达四十三亿二千万元。二、计划不仅是先进的，而且也是全面的。计划内容不仅注意了生产和安全，而且注意了经济和效率，使生产和财务成本紧密结合。管理部门在“面向生产、为生产服务”这个总前提下也改进了材料供应、仓库管理等制度，并提出材料送到车间，密切了和生产车间的联系。三、为了实现计划中的这些先进指标，他们还制订了一系列技术组织措施。在厂一级共制定了八项具体措施；车间、小组围绕各项任务指标制订了一系列具体的技术组织保证措施，机、电、炉、修配四个车间提高和制定了四十二种制度和操作规程，有计划地巩固和推广了十五种先进经验，各个小组一直到每个职工（包括管理部门）也制订出小组和个人的具体保证计划。通过集体合同，党、行政、工会、青年团和全体职工在“保证全年安全经济大发电、全面完成国家计划”的总的奋斗目标之下，统一了思想和行动。现在，唐山发电厂正抓紧作好周密的作业计划，彻底改变管理部门落后于生产的现象；并继续加强各项工作，防止任何在执行计划中的松弛现象发生，保证按时地、全面地完成计划。
