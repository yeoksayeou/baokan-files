    Correctly Understanding the Significance of the New National Economic Construction
    —Special Interview with the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    By our reporters Liu Shiping, Chang Gong, and Fan Rongkang

    On the eve of the opening of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, we visited Comrade Zhang Weizhen, head of the Northeast Trade Union delegation. We were in a very small room, and we had just sat down and hadn’t had time to talk when a delegate ran in excitedly and asked Comrade Zhang Weizhen, "Chairman Zhang, why isn't there large-scale construction in our area?" Comrade Zhang Weizhen considered it and asked the delegate in return, "What is large-scale construction?" The delegate couldn't answer for a moment. Comrade Zhang Weizhen then told us that some comrades now, when they talk about new economic construction, emphasize "large-scale." In fact, we should not misunderstand the large-scale construction of our country. The so-called "large-scale," from a national perspective, means building our country in all aspects. Among these, focusing on and developing heavy industry in a planned way is definitely the fundamental construction for the country's industrialization, because only with a strong heavy industry can we talk about further developing other industries; and only then can we ensure the continuous growth of the socialist economic components in our country, so that our country can steadily industrialize and transition to a socialist society. However, all of this must start from our country's current socio-economic foundation. We cannot build many new industries all at once. Therefore, the new economic construction also includes developing agriculture, small-scale enterprises in small and medium-sized towns, and also developing handicrafts that serve agricultural production. Only in this way can we unleash the potential of our country for developing production, and only then can heavy industry construction be guaranteed. Even from the perspective of industrial construction, it not only involves focusing on and developing some new, modernized, and decisive heavy industries in a planned way, but also includes rebuilding and expanding the numerous existing industries. He said that old equipment is a valuable asset for building our industry, and fully utilizing the utilization rate of old equipment is also an important driving force for promoting and ensuring the accelerated progress of our industrial construction. Whoever neglects this will make mistakes.
    This short conversation seems like a small matter, but it reflects a common ideological problem. This problem is how we can correctly and comprehensively understand our country's new economic construction. Our country, until now, is still a country where small producers account for the absolute majority. To build industry and achieve national industrialization is actually a process of socialist transformation of our national economy. Therefore, we must have a correct and comprehensive understanding of this issue. However, in this conference, judging from the representatives we have come into contact with, some are from Shanghai and Shenyang, some are from Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, and some are from small and medium-sized towns and various industrial and mining enterprises. Their conversations all reflect that this problem has not been completely resolved, and they all believe that if this ideological problem cannot be correctly and thoroughly resolved, it will be detrimental to the completion of our country's first Five-Year Plan for economic construction that has already begun.
    Representatives from Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places mentioned that in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, some cadres and workers mistakenly believe that only newly built, large-scale, modernized, decisive, and historically unprecedented factories and mines in our country can be considered "large-scale" construction; and factories and mines with outdated machinery that need to be rebuilt and expanded are not included in the scope of "large-scale" construction. Therefore, these people are not content with their original positions and want to go to "large-scale" places like Anshan Iron and Steel Company. In fact, the large-scale construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, according to Comrade Shen Ce, chairman of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Trade Union, not only involves building new, modernized, decisive, and historically unprecedented factories, but also carrying out a vigorous mass creative movement to transform old machinery and equipment into mechanized and automated ones. The purpose is to highly leverage the potential of machinery and equipment, and to advance simultaneously with the new construction; even in the newly built factories or mines, many are rebuilt or expanded on the original basis. According to a Shanghai labor model who has been to the Soviet Union, he visited the famous "Three Mountains" textile factory when he went to Moscow in 1952 to attend the "May Day" celebrations. Before he visited, his mind was full of new machinery and new equipment, everything was new; but after the visit, he said that he received a great education, because in that factory, although there were many new machines, the old machines were also running. What surprised him even more was that some of the old machines he saw were not as new as those in the Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill. Comrades Yang Zhenben and Wu En from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also reflected that people in our country's border areas and vast rural areas do not have a clear understanding of the country's new economic construction. They said that some cadres and masses in these areas believe that our country's new economic construction is simply to build large industries in big cities, so they are not content with their original jobs and are always thinking about going to so-called "big cities and big industries," and some cadres even directly propose to go to the Northeast. In fact, this is also a manifestation of an incomplete understanding of our country's new economic construction. They said that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, like other vast rural areas, mainly focuses on agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry; there is very little industry, which is a fact. But is a country only building industry without simultaneously developing agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry called economic construction? Of course not. Because to build large industries in big cities, how can we build industry without the cooperation of agriculture and animal husbandry, supplying raw materials for industrial production and food for workers? Moreover, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other remote areas are not without industry. Now, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has factories for making sacks, farm tools, leather, pig bristles, paper, milk, chemicals, and flax. These industries are indispensable for the lives of the local people. Moreover, in the first Five-Year Plan, Inner Mongolia will also build larger-scale industries such as leather, farm tools, and coal mines. Therefore, they believe that our country's new economic construction is to adapt to and revolve around the central link of building our country's industry, develop agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and the original various industries. Only in this way can our country build a strong industry, and our people of all ethnic groups can move towards a happy life.
    Liu Shucheng, a representative from small and medium-sized towns in Hubei Province, also pointed out in his speech at the conference that cadres, workers, shop assistants, and apprentices working in handicrafts and private enterprises in small and medium-sized towns do not have a comprehensive understanding of the country's new economic construction. He said that there are a total of 400,000 workers in towns below the 74 counties in Hubei Province, of which 200,000 are in small and medium-sized towns. They are not only the hub for promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, but also indispensable when our country's modern industry is not yet able to meet the needs of the vast number of farmers. However, after the country's new economic construction began, cadres working in these small and medium-sized enterprises mistakenly believed that only the construction of state-owned industries can be considered "large-scale" construction; developing handicrafts at the same time as building state-owned enterprises, gradually moving towards cooperativization, and correctly developing private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are not considered "large-scale" construction. Therefore, among the workers, only the so-called "large-scale" is promoted, and "Central China Iron and Steel Company" is promoted. As a result, workers in small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the province, under this influence, are constantly planning to go here and there, and do not actively engage in production; some who are engaged in production do not actively reduce costs and improve quality, and thus cannot meet the requirements of the vast number of farmers after land reform; this influence also spread to the nearby rural areas, causing farmers to blindly flow into the cities, affecting rural production. Therefore, he also believes that in the new economic construction, while building heavy industry, we must pay attention to handicrafts and private enterprises, because these handicrafts and private enterprises not only account for a large number in Hubei Province, but also the same in other provinces across the country.
    What exactly should be the full significance of the new economic construction? Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out clearly in his congratulatory speech to the conference on behalf of the CPC Central Committee: "Under the current conditions, the development of our country first requires that our country's industry must have rapid development, especially the development and establishment of our country's heavy industry. The current level of industrial production in our country, both in terms of quantity and quality, must be improved year by year. Many factories will need to be rebuilt and expanded. At the same time, many new factories and new industrial production departments will also need to be built, and other economic undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings must also adapt to the development of industry and develop rapidly." Comrade Jia Tuofu pointed out in the "Report on the Industrial Situation": Under this general goal, the basic task of our country's first Five-Year Plan is to concentrate efforts on the construction of heavy industry and lay the foundation for national industrialization. At the same time, we must also "develop light industry accordingly; actively develop agriculture and handicrafts, and promote their cooperativization in a planned way; correctly develop the role of all private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; and improve the people's material and cultural level on the basis of developing production." Therefore, under the leadership of the national planned economy, from the heavy industry construction of the steel capital Anshan to the light industry construction of the big city Shanghai; from the leather industry of Inner Mongolia on the border to the oil of Xinjiang; from the handicrafts of small towns in Hubei Province to the remote places in the southwest and private enterprises throughout the country that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, pastures, etc. in the vast areas to cooperate with industrial construction, all walks of life, regardless of industry, agriculture, big cities, small towns, big industrial and mining enterprises, small enterprises, new construction and old transformation, as long as it is conducive to the industrialization of our country and gradually transition to a socialist society, it is all part of the large-scale economic construction. Only within the national scope, with all aspects of economic construction developing correctly under the leadership of a unified national plan, can it weave into a beautiful scene of large-scale economic construction.
    Only by looking at the problem from this perspective can we have a correct and comprehensive understanding of our country's new economic construction. With this understanding, we can quickly complete our country's first Five-Year Plan and enable our country to steadily achieve industrialization and transition to a socialist society.

    正确地认识国家新的经济建设的意义
    ——中国工会第七次全国代表大会专题访问
    本报记者　刘时平、常　工、范荣康
    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会开幕的前夕，我们去访问东北工会代表团团长张维桢同志。那是在一间很小的房间里，我们刚刚坐下来，还没有来得及谈话，就有一个代表兴高采烈地跑进来，问张维桢同志：“张主席，我们那里为什么不搞大规模建设？”张维桢同志考虑了一下，反过来问那个代表：“什么叫大规模建设？”那个代表一下答不上来。张维桢同志接着就向我们说，现在有些同志，一谈到新的经济建设，就要强调“大规模”。其实，不应该不正确地来了解我们国家的大规模建设。所谓“大规模”，从全国角度来说，就是要从各方面来建设我们的国家。这中间首先要有重点地有步骤地建设重工业，是肯定的，也是国家工业化的基本建设，因为只有我们有了强大的重工业，才能谈得上进一步地发展其他工业；也才能保证我国社会主义经济成份的不断增长，使我国稳步地工业化和过渡到社会主义社会去。但是，这一切，必须从我国现在的社会经济基础出发，我们不可能一下子建设起许多新的工业，所以在新的经济建设中，也还包括发展农业、中小城镇的小规模的企业，而且还包括发展为农业生产服务的手工业在内。只有这样，把我国能够用来发展生产的潜在力量发挥起来，重工业建设才能有保证。就是从工业建设方面来说，也不只是有重点地、有步骤地建设一些新的、近代化的、有决定意义的重工业，而且还包括改建和扩建的数量众多的旧有的各种工业。他说，旧有设备是建设我国工业的宝贵财产，充分发挥旧有设备的运用率，也是推动和保证我国工业建设加速前进的重要动力。谁轻视这一点，谁就会犯错误。
    这次短短的谈话，听上去好像是一件很小的事情，但是，在这段话里，却反映了一个普遍的思想问题。这个问题，就是我们如何正确而全面地认识我们国家新的经济建设的问题。我们的国家直到现在为止，还是小生产者占绝对优势的国家。我们要建设工业，实现国家工业化，实际上就是对我国国民经济进行社会主义改造的过程。因此，就必须对这一问题有正确的全面的认识。但是，在这次大会中，从我们曾经接触过的代表来看，他们有来自上海、沈阳的，也有来自内蒙古、新疆的，还有来自各地中小城镇以及各种工矿企业的，他们的谈话却都反映了这一个问题并没有完全解决，并且他们还都认为，如果这一思想问题不能得到正确的彻底的解决，对完成我国已经开始的第一个五年经济建设计划是不利的。
    从上海、沈阳等地来的代表谈到，在国营工矿企业中，有一些干部和工人，对于我国的新的经济建设，错误地认为只有新建的、大规模的、近代化的、有决定意义的、我国历史上没有过的工厂和矿山，才算是“大规模”的建设；而机器陈旧、需要改建和扩建的工厂和矿山，都不包括在“大规模”建设的范围之内。因此，这些人就不安心于原来的岗位，而想到鞍山钢铁公司那样“大规模”的地方去。事实上，鞍山钢铁公司开始的大规模建设，据鞍山钢铁公司总工会主席沈策同志说，也不仅只是建设新的、近代化的、有决定意义的、我国历史上没有过的工厂，同时，还开展了轰轰烈烈的变旧机器设备为机械化自动化的群众性的创造性的运动，其目的也就是为了高度地发挥机器设备的潜在能力，和新建的建设同时并进；就是在新建的工厂或矿山中，也还有不少是在原有的基础上改建或扩建的。据去过苏联的一位上海的劳动模范说，他在一九五二年到莫斯科参加“五一”节观礼时，曾参观过有名的“三山”纺织厂。当他没有参观以前，满脑子想的都是新机械新设备，什么都是新的；可是参观完了以后，他说，给了他一次很大的教育，因为在那个工厂里，新的机器固然不少，但旧的机器也同样开动着，更使他吃惊的是他看到的有些旧机器还没有上海国营第一棉纺织厂的机器新。从内蒙古自治区来的代表杨珍本、乌恩两同志，也反映了在我们祖国的边疆和广大的农村中，人们对于国家新的经济建设的认识不够明确。他们说，这些地区有些干部和群众，以为我国新的经济建设，就是单纯地在大城市建设大工业，因此，就都不安心于原来的工作岗位，时时刻刻想到所谓“大城市大工业”去，有些干部就更直接地提出要到东北去。事实上，这也是对我国新的经济建设认识不全面的表现。他们说，内蒙古自治区和其他广大的农村一样，主要的是农业、牧业、林业；工业很少，这是事实。但是一个国家光建设工业，而不同时发展农业、牧业、林业，那叫经济建设吗？当然不是的。因为要在大城市建立大工业，如果没有农牧业的配合，供给工业生产的原料，供给工人的食粮，那怎能建设工业呢？何况内蒙古自治区和其他辽远的地区，也并不是没有工业。现在内蒙古自治区，就有麻袋、农具、皮革、猪鬃、造纸、牛奶、化学、亚麻等工厂，这些工业，都是为当地人民生活中所不可缺少的。何况在第一个五年建设计划中，内蒙还要建设规模较大的皮革、农具、煤矿等工业。因此，他们认为我国新的经济建设，就是要适应和围绕建设我国工业的这一个中心环节，发展农业、牧业、林业和原有的各种工业，只有这样，我国才能建设起强大的工业，我国各族人民才能走向幸福生活的道路。
    湖北省中小城镇的代表刘树成在大会的发言中，也指出了在中小城镇中手工业、私营企业中工作的干部、工人、店员和学徒，对于国家新的经济建设的认识是不全面的。他说，湖北省分散在七十四个县以下的城镇中的工人共有四十万，其中中小城镇的工人就占二十万，他们不仅是促进城乡物资交流的枢纽，而且也是在我国现代化工业还没有可能满足广大农民需要的时候所不可缺少的。但是，当国家新的经济建设开始后，在这些中小企业中工作的干部，错误地以为只有国营工业的建设，才算“大规模”的建设；在建设国营企业的同时，发展手工业，使其逐渐走向合作化，并正确地发展有利于国计民生的私营企业，不算是“大规模”建设。因此，就在工人中，只宣传所谓“大规模”，宣传“华中钢铁公司”，结果全省中小企业的工人，在这种影响下面，便整天地打算着到这到那去，不积极地进行生产；有些进行生产的，也不积极降低成本，改进质量，因而就满足不了土地改革后广大农民的要求；这种影响也波及到附近的农村中，造成农民盲目流进城市的现象，影响了农村生产。因此，他也认为在新的经济建设中，和建设重工业的同时，必须注意到手工业和私营企业，因为这些手工业和私营企业，不仅仅在湖北省占了很大的数目，而且在全国其他省份也都是一样的。
    新的经济建设的全部意义究竟应该是什么？刘少奇同志代表中共中央向大会致祝词时，曾经明确地指出：“在目前条件下，我们国家的发展，首先要求我国的工业必须有迅速的发展，特别是要发展和建立我国的重工业。我国现有的工业生产水平，不论在数量上和质量上都必须逐年提高，许多工厂将要加以改建和扩建，同时，还要建设许多新的工厂和新的工业生产部门，其他经济事业和文化教育事业也必须适应工业的发展而迅速地发展起来。”贾拓夫同志在“关于工业情况的报告”中指出：在这一总的目标之下，我国第一个五年计划的基本任务，在于集中力量进行重工业的建设，为国家工业化建立基础。同时，还要“相适应地发展轻工业；积极地发展农业和手工业，有步骤地促进其合作化；正确地发展一切有利于国计民生的私营企业的作用；并在发展生产的基础上，提高人民的物质和文化水平”。因此在国家的计划经济领导之下，从钢都鞍山的重工业建设到大城市上海的轻工业建设；从边疆内蒙古的皮革工业到新疆的石油；从湖北省小城镇的手工业，到西南辽远的地方和全国各地有利于国计民生的私营企业，以及广大地区的原野上配合工业建设的农业、林业、水利、牧场等等，各行各业，不分工业、农业，不分大城市、小城镇，不管大工矿、小企业，新的建设和旧的改造，只要是有利于我们国家的工业化，并逐步地过渡到社会主义社会，就都是大规模经济建设的一个组成部分。只有在全国范围内，经济建设的各方面都在统一的国家计划领导之下，正确地发展起来，也才能交织成一幅大规模经济建设的美景。
    只有根据这样的观点来看问题，才是对我们国家新的经济建设的正确而全面的认识。有了这个认识，也才能迅速地完成我国的第一个五年建设计划，并使我国稳步地实现工业化并过渡到社会主义社会去。
