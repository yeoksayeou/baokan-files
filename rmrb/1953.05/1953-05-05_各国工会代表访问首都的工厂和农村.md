He was very grateful for this precious gift and said with emotion: Chinese workers are full of internationalist enthusiasm.
    The foreign trade union representatives visited the Changxindian Railway Factory's technical school and sanatorium for amateur workers. Finally, the foreign guests visited the factory's "Advanced Work Methods Exhibition."

The Czechoslovak delegation praised the happy life of Chinese workers, and the head of the delegation, Maria Trojanova, on behalf of four million Czechoslovak workers, wished the Chinese workers greater achievements in the first five-year plan and the early construction of socialism.

They saw the fact that agricultural production has been increasing year after year after the land reform, and saw the boundless labor enthusiasm of the peasants of New China.
    The prosperous atmosphere of the new Chinese countryside and the happy smiling faces of the emancipated peasants left a deep impression on the representatives. Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, spoke to the peasants of Bajiao Village, which exactly expressed the feelings of trade union representatives from many countries. He said: The old system that was oppressing the Chinese people five years ago has been destroyed, but it still exists in our countries. Today we spent a very simple and ordinary day, but the unity and mutual assistance between us has been further strengthened.

    各国工会代表访问首都的工厂和农村
    据新华社讯：应邀前来我国的世界工会联合会代表团和各国工会代表，在三日、四日访问了首都的工厂和郊区的农村，会晤了新中国的工人和农民。
    在三日下午，越南、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、印度、朝鲜、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、印度尼西亚和日本十一个国家的工会代表，参观了长辛店铁路工厂。工厂的每一件事物都引起外宾们极大的兴趣，工人们的热情使他们极为感动。
    波兰代表团的邓比卡雅，把两条彩色鲜艳的围巾，送给了机车场的女电焊工实习生陈荣品和十八岁的女钻床工冯淑珍。印尼代表哈约用自己的自治区工会会章，交换了货车场主任崔凤江的铁路路徽。德意志民主共和国的劳动英雄马丁·拉布，收到客车场由工人提拔起来的技术定额员赵学勤送的一个学习奖章，他非常感谢这个珍贵的礼物，他很感动地说：中国工人都充满着国际主义的热情。
    外国工会代表参观了长辛店铁路工厂的技工学校和业余疗养所，外宾们最后参观了该厂的“先进工作方法展览大会”。在展览大会的留言簿上，罗马尼亚代表们祝中国工人同志在胜利的基础上争取更大的胜利。捷克斯洛伐克代表团赞美中国工人的幸福生活，团长玛丽亚·特罗雅诺娃代表四百万捷克斯洛伐克工人，祝中国工人在第一个五年计划中获得更大的成绩，早日建设起社会主义。
    世界工会联合会代表团和来自十七国及非洲的工会代表，在四日分组访问了首都郊区的七个农村，和新中国的农民在一起欢愉地度过了一天。他们看到土地改革后农业生产年年提高的事实，看到新中国农民们无穷尽的劳动热情。
    新中国农村的繁荣气象和翻身农民的幸福的笑脸，给代表们留下极为深刻的印象。世界工会联合会总书记、法国的路易·赛扬对八角村农民的谈话，正好说出了许多国家工会代表的心情，他说：五年前还在压迫中国人民的旧制度已经摧毁了，但在我们的国家里还存在。今天我们度过很朴素平常的一天，但我们之间的团结互助已经更加加强了。
