To our respected and beloved great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, representing the people of all ethnic groups in China:

We are the representatives attending the inaugural meeting of the China Islamic Association. We come from ten minority ethnic groups who believe in Islam. We have come to the people's capital from the border regions and inland provinces and cities of our motherland. We bring the love, gratitude, and blessings of over ten million of our co-religionists to you.

In the past, under the dark rule of the reactionary government—especially the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek—and under the aggression and oppression of imperialism, we lived an unbearable life. Not only were our religious beliefs and customs interfered with and destroyed, but even our lives and property were not guaranteed.

Since the nationwide liberation, under the light of your correct ethnic and religious policies, we have obtained the rights of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief, and our customs have been respected and cared for. Our gratitude to you cannot be expressed in words.

After the great movements of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the political consciousness of our co-religionists across the country has been greatly raised, and at the same time, our lives have gradually improved. This time, we came to Beijing to participate in the inaugural meeting of the China Islamic Association. We saw the greatness and loveliness of our motherland with our own eyes, and we heard the policy reports of the leaders with our own ears. We received profound patriotic education and internationalist education.

After we return to our hometowns, we will publicize the content and spirit of this meeting to the broad masses of co-religionists, so that they can further recognize the brilliant achievements our motherland has made under your wise leadership and the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the generous assistance of the great Soviet people, over the past three years. We will make them further understand the actual situation at home and abroad, as well as the three major tasks for this year.

Our co-religionists across the country must study hard, step up production, and strengthen the unity between all ethnic groups and within each ethnic group. We must assist the People's Government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, carry forward the fine traditions of Islam, love our motherland, and defend world peace.

Finally, on behalf of our co-religionists across the country, we extend to you with utmost enthusiasm,

Our most profound respect.

All Representatives of the Inaugural Meeting of the China Islamic Association (signatures)

    中国伊斯兰教协会成立会议全体代表
    向毛泽东主席致敬信中国各民族人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    我们是参加中国伊斯兰教协会成立会议的代表，我们来自信仰伊斯兰教的十个少数民族，我们从祖国的边疆和内地各省市来到人民首都，我们带来了千余万教胞对于您的敬爱、感谢和祝福。
    我们在过去反动政府——特别是蒋介石反动政府的黑暗统治之下，在帝国主义的侵略和压迫之下，过着不堪忍受的生活，不但我们的宗教信仰和风俗习惯受到干涉和摧残，连我们的生命、财产也没有保障。
    自全国解放以来，在您正确的民族政策和宗教政策的照耀之下，我们才获得了民族平等的权利和宗教信仰的自由，我们的风俗习惯才受到尊重和照顾。我们对于您的感激，绝不是语言文字所能表达的。
    经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革、“三反”“五反”等伟大的运动之后，我们全国教胞的政治觉悟已大大地提高了，同时，我们的生活也逐渐获得改善。此次，我们来京参加中国伊斯兰教协会成立会议，亲眼看到祖国的伟大和可爱，亲耳听到首长们的政策报告，受到了深刻的爱国主义教育和国际主义教育。
    我们返回故乡之后，要把此次会议的内容和精神，向广大的教胞作宣传，使他们更加认识，三年多以来，在您和中国共产党英明的领导之下，在伟大苏联人民慷慨的帮助之下，我们祖国所获得的辉煌成就，使他们更加了解国内和国外的实际情况，以及今年的三大任务。
    我们全国教胞要努力学习，加紧生产，加强各民族之间的团结和民族内部的团结。我们要协助人民政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策，发扬伊斯兰教优良传统，爱护祖国，保卫世界和平。
    最后，我们谨代表全国教胞，以万分的热忱，向您致
    最崇高的敬礼中国伊斯兰教协会成立会议全体代表（签名）
