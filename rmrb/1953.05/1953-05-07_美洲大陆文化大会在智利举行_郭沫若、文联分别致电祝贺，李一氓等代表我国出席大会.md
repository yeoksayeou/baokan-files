Guo Moruo sent a telegram to the congress expressing his heartfelt congratulations. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the First Continental Cultural Congress of the Americas:

Please allow me to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the congress and all the delegates present at the opening of the Continental Cultural Congress of the Americas.

Free and full cultural exchange between the people of all countries is an important condition for increasing mutual understanding and friendship between the people of all countries, and it is also an important factor in defending world peace and enriching the cultural lives of the people of all countries. I believe that all benevolent people in the cultural circles will surely unite closely to fight against war, defend world peace, oppose blockade, and strive for the freedom of cultural exchange. I wish your congress a great success and wish all the delegates good health.

We are delighted to hear that the congress is about to open. We hereby send our congratulations and extend our fraternal greetings to all the delegates!

Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 26th, TASS dispatch: Approximately forty progressive American writers, artists, actors, and other cultural workers sent a congratulatory telegram to the Continental Cultural Congress which opened in Santiago, Chile (i.e., the First Congress of Cultural Workers of Latin American Countries mentioned in the previous telegram). The telegram stated:

“We, the undersigned North American writers, scientists, artists, and freelancers, wholeheartedly endorse the goals of the Continental Cultural Congress. We endorse it because we believe in the basic truth expressed in the call to convene this congress—‘the anxiety and sorrow of the people of the world and the various problems related to the Americas demand that good people work hard to strive for a life based on understanding and trust’....Unfortunately, what we need most is cultural exchange; however, we are currently unable to obtain any.

“At this time in our nation's history, our government does not endorse the free exchange of ideas. Many cultural workers are not allowed to participate in international congresses like the one you are convening because the government refuses to issue passports.... For this reason, many people who deeply wish to participate in the Continental Cultural Congress will not be able to attend. However...we are participating in spirit, in cultural cooperation, and in our endorsement of your purposes.”

The signatories included novelists Howard Fast, Michael Gold, Albert Maltz, Lloyd Brown, the famous Black historian W.E.B. Du Bois, critics John Howard Lawson, Samuel Sillen, Sidney Finkelstein, publisher Alexander Trachtenberg, artists Hugo Gellert, Charles White, Stephen Nelson, and Victor Jerome, among others.

    李一氓在五月三日代表中国文化界向大会讲话。他谈到美洲各国的文艺作品介绍到中国的情形，并谈到中国文艺工作的发展与成就。代表们对他的演说表示热烈欢迎。
    美洲大陆文化大会在五月三日早上的会议中通过了一个包括四点内容的决议案。在同日下午大会的闭幕会议上，李一氓再次发表演说，祝贺大会的成就。
    【新华社讯】第一届美洲大陆文化大会于四月二十八日在智利圣地亚哥举行，郭沫若特电大会表示衷心的祝贺。电文如下：第一届美洲大陆文化大会：
    请允许我在美洲大陆文化大会开幕的时候，向大会及与会的全体代表致以衷心的祝贺。
    各国人民间自由的、充分的文化交流，是增加各国人民彼此了解、团结友好的重要条件，也是保卫世界和平以及丰富各国人民的文化生活的重要因素。我相信所有良善的文化界人士，定能紧密地团结起来，为反对战争，保卫世界和平，反对封锁，争取文化交流的自由而奋斗。我预祝你们的大会获得伟大的成功，并祝全体代表的身体健康。

    【新华社讯】第一届美洲大陆文化大会于四月二十八日在智利圣地亚哥召开，中华全国文学艺术界联合会特致电祝贺。电文如下：第一届美洲大陆文化大会：
    欣闻大会即将开幕，谨电致贺，并向全体代表致以兄弟的敬礼！

                        四月二十七日
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约四月二十六日讯：约有四十位美国进步作家、艺术家、演员以及其它文化工作者向在智利圣地亚哥开幕的大陆文化大会（按即前电所发拉丁美洲国家文化工作者第一次代表大会）发了一个贺电。电文中说：
    “我们在下面签名的北美作家、科学家、艺术家以及自由职业者衷心赞成大陆文化大会的目标。我们所以赞成是因为我们相信召集这次大会的发起书中所表示的基本真理——‘世界人民的焦急与悲痛心情以及与美洲大陆有关的种种问题，要求善良的人民努力参加争取以谅解与信任为基础的生活’……。不幸的是，我们最需要文化交流；可是，目前我们一点也得不到。
    “在我国历史的这个时候，我国政府并不赞成自由交换思想。许多文化工作者不许参加类似你们所召开的国际性大会，因为政府拒绝签发护照……。为了这个原故，许多深愿参加大陆文化大会的人将都不能出席。可是……我们在精神上、在文化合作上、在赞同你们的目的上，是等于参加的。”
    签名的人包括小说家霍华德·法斯特，迈克尔·戈尔德，艾伯特·马尔兹，劳埃德·布朗，著名黑人历史学家杜波依斯，评论家约翰·霍华德·劳逊、塞缪尔·西伦、悉尼·芬克尔斯坦，出版家亚历山大·特拉腾堡，艺术家雨果·格勒特、查尔斯·怀特，斯蒂芬·纳尔逊，维克托·季洛姆等。
