    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 2nd: This reporter reports: In the last five days of April, the Korean front experienced intermittent rain and sunshine, and the Korean-Chinese People's Forces attacked small enemy positions in the rain.
    Before dawn on the 26th, a unit of our army on the eastern front attacked a position of the ROK (Republic of Korea) 12th Division east of Changcheng-ri, wiping out 86 enemy soldiers, with no casualties on our side. At the same time, another unit of our army also attacked another enemy position near Changcheng-ri, killing or wounding more than 60 enemy soldiers, and destroying more than a dozen enemy bunkers and firing points. On the night of the 29th, a small unit of our army encountered a company of the ROK 11th Division near Waemyeon-ri, south of Goseong. Although the enemy's strength was many times greater than ours, our army bravely opened fire and fiercely attacked the panicked enemy. After half an hour of combat, nearly 100 enemy soldiers were eliminated, while we only sacrificed one soldier. In more than ten short battles on the eastern front in five days, our army wiped out more than 400 enemy soldiers.
    The battle on the central and western fronts was relatively quiet, with only small-scale blocking actions and contact between enemy and our reconnaissance teams.
    From April 26th to 30th, our army's mobile frontline artillery killed or wounded a total of 243 enemy soldiers; our army's frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down ten enemy planes and damaged twenty-two.

    朝中人民部队四月末冒雨袭击敌军阵地
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】本社记者报道：在四月份的最后五天中，朝鲜前线时雨时晴，朝中人民部队在雨水中袭击敌军的小块阵地。
    二十六日天亮以前，东线我军某部袭击长承里以东李伪军第十二师的一处阵地，歼灭敌军八十六名，我军无一伤亡。同时，另支我军也袭击长承里附近另一个敌军阵地，杀伤敌军六十多名，并炸毁敌军掩蔽部、火力点十多处。二十九日夜，我军一支小部队在高城以南外沔里附近与李伪军十一师一个连遭遇，虽然敌军兵力比我军大好多倍，但我军却勇敢地展开火力，痛击张惶失措的敌人，经半个小时的战斗，消灭敌军近百名，我军只牺牲一人。五天中，我军在东线十余次短促的战斗中歼灭了四百多名敌军。
    中线和西线战斗比较沉寂，只有小规模的阻击战和敌我侦察队的接触。
    四月二十六日至三十日，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军二百四十三名；我军前线高射炮火击落敌机十架，击伤二十二架。
