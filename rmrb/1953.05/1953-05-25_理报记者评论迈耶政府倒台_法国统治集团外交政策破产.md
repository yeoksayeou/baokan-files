    *Pravda* Reporter Comments on the Fall of the Mayer Government
    The Bankruptcy of the French Ruling Group's Foreign Policy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th] TASS, Moscow, 23rd: The *Pravda* Paris reporter, Rasakin, wrote an article analyzing the reasons for the fall of the French Mayer cabinet. Rasakin wrote that the French government was forced to resign during the parliamentary discussion of France's financial situation, and this is not the first time. The issue of contention is not this or that financial plan, but the foreign and domestic policies pursued by the French ruling group, which are reflected in the budget.
    Due to the recent government crisis, some French newspapers analyzed the political line pursued by the Mayer government. Continuing to promote the Atlantic policy and conducting the Indochina War remain the focus of the Mayer government's foreign policy. However, this policy cannot gain the support of the French people. French parliamentarians have also had to consider this. Whether in newspapers or in parliament, the voices against continuing the Indochina War are getting louder and louder. What has particularly dissatisfied the public recently is the lack of independence in French foreign policy. The Mayer government relies entirely on dollar handouts to determine its policies.
    Rasakin then pointed out: Therefore, the fall of the Mayer cabinet signifies the bankruptcy of the French ruling group's foreign policy. As for the former government's domestic policy, it also failed to gain the support of the majority of the people. If the financial bill drafted by the Mayer government is passed, it will not eliminate France's financial difficulties, but will only increase the burden on the French working people. Bourgeois parliamentarians had to consider the sentiments of the voters and therefore voted against the government.
    Rasakin continued, a prominent feature during the Mayer government's tenure was the continuous growth of the strike movement. The working people oppose the high cost of living, demand wage increases and improved working conditions, and the scale of this struggle is expanding more and more. The Mayer government's response was repression. It demanded that parliament grant "special powers" to ban the strike movement. It attempted to make some reactionary reforms to the French constitution, thereby further fascistizing the French regime.
    At this critical juncture, the democratic forces in France have proven themselves to be strong enough to resist the offensive of the reactionaries. This has been clearly demonstrated in the recent municipal elections held throughout the country and in the parliamentary elections in the Seine province.

    真理报记者评论迈耶政府倒台
    法国统治集团外交政策破产
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：“真理报”巴黎记者拉萨金撰文分析法国迈耶内阁倒台的原因。拉萨金写道，法国政府在议会讨论法国财政情况时被迫辞职，这并不是第一次。争执的问题并不是这个或那个财政方案，而是法国统治集团所奉行的反映在预算上的外交与国内政策。
    由于最近的政府危机，一些法国报纸分析了迈耶政府所奉行的政治路线。继续推行大西洋政策与进行印度支那战争仍然是迈耶政府的外交政策的重心。但是，这个政策不能获得法国人民的支持。法国的议会人士也不得不考虑到这一点。无论在报纸上与议会中，反对继续进行印度支那战争的声浪愈来愈高涨了。最近特别使公众不满的是法国外交政策中缺乏独立精神。迈耶政府完全依靠美元施舍来决定它的政策。
    拉萨金接着指出：因此，迈耶内阁的倒台意味着法国统治集团外交政策的破产。至于前政府的国内政策也同样没有获得大多数人民的支持。如果通过迈耶政府起草的财政法案，那决不会消除法国的财政困难，而只会在法国劳动人民身上加重负担。资产阶级议员不得不考虑到选民们的情绪，因此投票反对政府。
    拉萨金继续说，迈耶政府执政期间突出的一点是罢工运动不断增长。劳动人民反对生活费用的高涨、要求增加工资与改善工作条件，这种斗争的规模愈来愈扩大了。迈耶政府的对策是进行镇压。它要求议会给予“特别权力”来禁止罢工运动。它试图对法国宪法作一些反动的改革，从而使法国政权进一步法西斯化。
    在这个紧要关头，法国的民主力量证明本身是充分地强大，足以抵抗反动派的进攻。最近无论在全国举行的市政选举中与塞纳省的议会选举中，都清楚地表明了这一点。
