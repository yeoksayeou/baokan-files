The New Warsaw of the People
	Mao Dun

	It was a clear winter morning. The golden sunlight slanted on the ancient bronze statue of the Warsaw Guardian on the Vistula River. This was a mermaid holding a shield and a sword, close to the riverbank, looking as if it had just emerged from the water and was standing on the shore.
	This scene suddenly reminded me of the great and magnificent scene in 1945 when the Soviet and Polish troops crossed the river and landed first in the Praga district of Warsaw. The Praga district was the first district of Warsaw to be liberated. At that time, the bridges across the Vistula River had all been completely destroyed; at that time, the entire city of Warsaw was shrouded in smoke and fire, and the defeated and dying fascist bandits were still systematically carrying out barbaric and inhuman large-scale explosions and burnings in this city that the Polish people had worked hard to build for centuries.
	At that time, the Hitler gang was determined to wipe Warsaw off the map. These bandits, more brutal than beasts, had for months been burying explosives and mines in the districts, streets, and houses of Warsaw, blowing up entire districts and streets into piles of rubble.
	The beasts were so crazy that even when the Soviet and Polish troops had encircled them and the bandit army had fled Warsaw, special demolition teams were still digging holes in the foundations of ancient buildings in the city to bury explosives. When the heroic Soviet and Polish troops liberated Warsaw with the force of a thunderbolt and cleared this group of wicked bandits from the city, this once prosperous and beautiful city was like the victim of the most violent earthquake. Electricity, telephone, running water, sewers—all these essential facilities of life were destroyed; streets and alleys were full of broken walls and rubble piles like hills, blocking traffic. At that time, journalists from capitalist countries who had been to Warsaw estimated that it would take years just to clear the rubble; as for rebuilding it and making it worthy of being the capital of the People's Republic, how much time would it take? Bourgeois journalists dared not even think about it.
	Now the facts are here: Warsaw, which was 80 percent destroyed, Warsaw, from which two million enemy-buried bombs and mines were unearthed in the early days of liberation, has once again stood proudly on the banks of the Vistula River, more majestic and beautiful than ever before. The Hitler gang's vicious plan was completely shattered by the Polish people's great patriotism and heroic actions! Glory to the heroic people of Warsaw, the heroic people of Poland, and the wise leader of the Polish people, Chairman Bierut!
	Across the Vistula River, there are now four new bridges. When we walked on one of these new bridges, our Polish friends excitedly told us how the Hitler gang blew up all five original bridges on the river when they fled; how the heroic Soviet army built a temporary wooden bridge in eight days; how the Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Stalin, gave the Polish people fraternal assistance in all aspects; how these four new bridges could be built in such a short period of time—mainly because they learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and received the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts.
	These four bridges are already different from the previous four, and are more advanced in technology and more beautiful in form, up to socialist standards. The entire construction of Warsaw is the same. 1949 can be said to be the year when restoration work ended and new construction began. Warsaw's six-year construction plan is not a reprint of the old Warsaw, but to build a new Warsaw that meets socialist standards.
	The urban construction plans of capitalist countries serve the bourgeoisie. The wealthy exploiting classes occupy the best locations in the city center, while the working class is driven to the outskirts; the so-called workers' residential areas are pigeon-cage-like, crowded houses, lacking sunlight and "green belts," with incomplete or even no sanitary facilities, and of course, there are no cultural, educational, and recreational facilities to serve the residents. The old Warsaw under the bourgeois regime was also like this. Now, the construction plan of the new Warsaw under the people's regime is completely different. In addition to the workers' residential areas connected to the factories, the city center will also be provided to the working class, the masters of the city. Along the east-west avenue, and in the areas where the rich used to live, several workers' residential areas will be established. Each residential area must have sufficient sunlight, "green belts," open spaces, cultural, educational, and recreational institutions, and all modern facilities that make life comfortable.
	New Warsaw will be an important industrial city. The existing factories will be expanded, and more than a dozen new industries will be established. The location and distribution of factories are subject to the overall plan, to correct the unplanned and chaotic state of the past. Living welfare, cultural, educational, and recreational facilities must also be included in the overall plan.
	We have been to such a newly built area that was recently completed. The five- or six-story buildings are already full of people, although the exterior of the buildings has not yet been decorated, the walls are still brick, and the outside of the doors and windows has not yet been painted. This is common in Warsaw. In order to solve the housing problem of the working people, "apartment" buildings are often moved into as soon as the interior decoration is completed, leaving the exterior decoration for later. Not only residential buildings are like this, but also institutions and factories. In such a new construction area, schools, cinemas, department stores, gardens, the club that is the activity center for all residents, as well as the Children's Palace, which is the activity center for young people and children, etc., and "green belts" have all been determined in the plan. These facilities may not all have been built yet, because housing shortages need to be solved first, so housing is built first.
	What will such a socialist-standard residential area look like when it is completely completed? Just look at a part of the MDM district to know. Here, there are wide boulevards, gardens, and apartment buildings decorated with marble, neat, majestic, and beautiful; here, there are department stores, schools, cinemas, cultural palaces, and all modern facilities that make life comfortable; here, the priority of residence is provided to Stakhanovite workers and those who have contributed to the construction of Warsaw!
	The socialist-standard architecture of New Warsaw not only pays attention to planning, hygiene, and the beauty of form, but also pays attention to the preservation and development of the national form of architecture. Repairing and even rebuilding historical ancient buildings is also one of the topics of Warsaw's construction.
	We saw a newly built row of houses that preserved the architectural style of the 16th century. This is a three- or four-story steel-concrete building with completely modernized internal equipment, but the external shape of the building (the shadows on the walls and the style of the doors and windows, etc.) completely preserves the national form of Polish architecture at that time. In all districts of Warsaw, ancient buildings that have been destroyed (some of which had already collapsed before this war) must now be restored as much as possible. In order not to lose its original appearance, artists refer to photos and drawings taken before the destruction. Many Warsaw landscape paintings by the 18th-century master painter B. B. Canaletto are important reference materials. Based on the works of this great painter, Poland's historical ancient buildings will appear in a new posture in this socialist city.
	The restoration of the "Old Town" is part of Warsaw's six-year construction plan. Restoration work is already underway. These are buildings from the 13th and 14th centuries, covering an area of about six hectares. Part of the "Old Town" was abandoned a long time ago, and houses were built on it. These houses were destroyed in this war, making it possible to restore the "Old Town" to its original appearance.
	New Warsaw, the Warsaw of the Polish people, will be several times larger than the old Warsaw. In 1939, Warsaw was 141.5 square kilometers, and New Warsaw—or Greater Warsaw—will cover an area of 400 square kilometers.
	The construction of Warsaw marks the great achievements of the Polish people in the cause of socialist construction. The fascist bandits turned Warsaw into a field of rubble, and the heroic Polish people, in a very short period of time and at a very fast speed, built the rubble-filled Warsaw more majestic and beautiful than before, which shows that under the leadership of the working class party, there are no difficulties that the people's regime cannot overcome. The construction of Warsaw marks the victory of the Polish people's socialist construction—not only in Warsaw, but throughout Poland; this victory is advancing at an increasingly faster pace. Without the correct leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and its wise leader, Chairman Bierut, such a victory would not be possible.
	In his report on the Warsaw construction six-year plan on July 3, 1949, Chairman Bierut pointed out:
	"The Warsaw construction plan does not unfairly consider only the needs of this capital and only to meet the requirements of the entire country. This plan is a plan to build Warsaw, and Warsaw is the capital of a socialist country. This capital affects and inspires the entire country, and will promote and accumulate the creative power of socialist construction to the most remote and most neglected areas. "At the forefront of our socialist construction is our capital—Warsaw. "However, the construction of the capital cannot be regarded as a work unrelated to the construction of the entire country and to our entire political and economic tasks. The construction of Warsaw and the construction of all cities and counties in our country are our contributions to the cause of peace, and it is to understand the value of our national culture and its most glorious development. The Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries are also engaged in the peaceful construction of their homelands that have been damaged by war, and, like us, are highly vigilant against all attempts to instigate war. In this great creative work, the peace and democratic camp—the strength of the invincible socialist builders—is growing stronger day by day!"
	The construction of Warsaw is part of the strengthening of the great peace, democracy, and socialist camp and the victory of the cause. During our short tour of Warsaw, we felt the same excitement and pride as the Polish people.
	Glory to the heroic people of Warsaw, the heroic people of Poland, and their wise leader, Chairman Bierut!

    人民的新华沙
    茅盾
    这是冬季的一个晴朗的早晨。黄澄澄的太阳光斜照着维斯杜拉河畔的华沙守护神的古老的铜像。这是一个持盾仗剑的鲛人，紧挨着河岸，远远看去，就好像是刚从水里钻出来，正站到岸上。
    这一景象，猛然叫我想起一九四五年苏联和波兰军队从河那边强渡而来，在华沙的普拉卡区首先登陆的伟大壮烈的场面。普拉卡区是华沙最初解放的一个区。那时候，横跨维斯杜拉河的几座大桥全已被彻底破坏；那时候，整个华沙正被烟火所笼罩，溃败而尚作垂死挣扎的法西斯强盗还在这波兰人民几世纪以来辛勤建设起来的都市内，有系统地进行着野蛮的灭绝人性的空前大规模的爆炸和焚烧。
    那时候，希特勒匪帮居心要把华沙从地图上消灭掉。这些比野兽还残暴的匪帮，曾有数月之久，在华沙城内挨区、挨街、挨屋，埋着炸药和地雷，把整个区、整条街，炸为一片瓦砾。
    野兽们疯狂到这种程度：在苏、波军队业已合围而匪军已从华沙溃逃的时候，特别的爆炸队还在市内的古建筑墙基上挖洞埋炸药。当英勇的苏军和波军以雷霆万钧之势解放了华沙，把这批万恶的匪帮从市内肃清的时候，这一个从前是繁华美丽的都市就像遭受了最凶猛的地震。电灯、电话、自来水、下水道——所有这一切生活上必需的设备，全被破坏；大街小巷，到处是断垣颓壁和小丘似的瓦砾堆，阻塞了交通。那时候，到过华沙的资本主义国家的记者们，曾有这样的估计：光是清除瓦砾就得数年之久；至于再建，并使其不愧为人民共和国的首都，那究竟需要多少时间呢？资产阶级的记者们是想也不敢想的。
    现在事实摆在这里：曾被破坏了百分之八十的华沙，在解放初期光是敌人埋藏的炸弹和地雷等等就起出了二百万枚的华沙，已经雄赳赳地再度峙立于维斯杜拉河畔，比从前任何时期更雄壮、更美丽了。希特勒匪帮的狠毒的计划，完全被波兰人民的伟大的爱国情绪和英勇的行动所粉碎了！光荣归于英勇的华沙人民，英勇的波兰人民，波兰人民英明的领袖贝鲁特主席！
    横跨在维斯杜拉河上，现在有四座新桥。当我们走上了这些新桥之一的时候，波兰朋友们兴奋地告诉我们：希特勒匪帮溃逃的时候，如何把河上原有的五座大桥全部炸毁；英勇的苏军如何曾用八天的工夫建立了一座临时性的木桥；苏联人民如何在伟大的斯大林领导之下从各方面给予波兰人民以兄弟般的援助；这四座新式的大桥如何能够在很短的时期内建造完成——主要是因为学习了苏联的先进经验和获得了苏联专家们的热忱的帮助。
    这四座桥已经不同于从前那四座，而是在技术上更进步，在形式上更美丽的社会主义标准的大桥。整个华沙的建设也是这样。一九四九年可以说是恢复工作结束而新建设开始的一年。华沙的六年建设计划，不是旧华沙的重版，而是要建设一个合乎社会主义标准的新华沙。
    资本主义国家的都市建设计划是为资产阶级服务的。有钱的剥削阶级占据了城市中心最好的地段，工人阶级则被赶到市郊边沿的区域；所谓工人住宅区是鸽子笼式的拥挤不堪的房屋，缺乏阳光和“绿带”，卫生设备不完全或竟没有，当然更说不上有以服务于居民为目的的文教娱乐的设备。资产阶级政权下的旧华沙也是这样。现在，人民政权下的新华沙的建设计划就完全不同了。除了联系着工厂的工人住宅区而外，市中心地段也将提供给城市的主人翁工人阶级。沿东西大道，以及从前富人们居住的区域，将建立几个工人住宅区。每个住宅区必须有充足的阳光，“绿带”、空地、文教娱乐机构以及一切使得生活舒适的现代设备。
    新华沙将是一个重要的工业城市。原有的工厂要加以扩充，十几种新的工业将要建立。工厂的位置和分布，都服从于整个计划，要纠正过去的那种无计划的凌乱的状态。生活福利、文教、娱乐的设备，也必须包括在整个计划之内。
    我们到过最近完工的这样的新建区。五六层高的大厦已经住满了人家，虽然大厦外表还没有装饰，墙壁还是砖面，门窗朝外的一面还没有油漆。这在华沙是常见的。为了解决劳动人民居住的问题，“公寓”式大厦往往内部装修刚刚完毕就先住进人去，外表的装饰留待日后。不但住宅是这样，机关、工厂也是这样的。在这样的新建区内，学校、影院、百货商店、花园，全区居民活动中心的俱乐部，以及青年和儿童活动中心的儿童宫等等，还有“绿带”，都已确定在计划之内，这些设备，也许现在还没有都修建，那是因为要解决房荒，所以先造住宅。
    这样的社会主义标准的住宅区在全部完工后将是怎样的雄壮和美丽呢？请看MDM区的一部分就知道了。在这里，有宽阔的林荫路，有花园和大理石装饰着的公寓大厦，整齐、雄壮而美丽；在这里，有百货商店、学校、影院、文化宫，有一切的使得生活舒适的现代设备；在这里，居住的优先权是提供给斯大哈诺夫式的工人们以及建设华沙有功的人们！
    新华沙的社会主义标准的建筑不但讲究计划化，讲究卫生，讲究形式的美丽，还讲究建筑的民族形式的保存和发展。修缮乃至重建历史性的古建筑，也是华沙建设的课题之一。
    我们看到了新建的保存着十六世纪建筑风格的一排房屋。这是三、四层高的钢骨水泥的建筑，内部设备完全近代化，但建筑的外形（墙壁上的影绘和门窗的式样等等）则完全保存着当时波兰建筑的民族形式。在华沙市内各区，古代建筑凡被毁的（其中有些是在这次战争以前就已经坍坏了的），现在都要尽可能地恢复起来。为了不失其本来面目，美术家们参考着被毁以前的照片和图画。十八世纪大画家勃·贝·卡那莱多所作的许多华沙风景画，是重要的参考材料。根据了这位大画家的作品，波兰的历史性古建筑将以新的姿态出现在这社会主义的都市。
    “古城”的恢复是华沙六年建设计划中的一部分。恢复工作已在进行。这是十三世纪和十四世纪的建筑，占地共约六公顷左右。“古城”的一部分在很久以前就已圯废，而且上面又盖了房屋，这些房屋在这次战争中已被破坏，因而就有可能把“古城”恢复到全部的本来面目。
    新华沙，波兰人民的华沙，将比旧华沙大几倍。一九三九年的华沙是一百四十一点五平方公里，新华沙——或大华沙，将占地四百平方公里。
    华沙的建设，标明了波兰人民在社会主义建设事业上的巨大成就。法西斯匪帮把华沙变成一片瓦砾场，英勇的波兰人民在极短的时期，以极快的速度，把瓦砾场的华沙建设得比从前更雄壮更美丽，这显示了在工人阶级政党领导下的人民政权是没有什么困难不能克服的。华沙的建设，标明了波兰人民的社会主义建设的胜利，——不但在华沙，而且在全波兰；这种胜利正以日益加快的步伐向前迈进。没有波兰统一工人党及其英明领袖贝鲁特主席的正确领导，这样的胜利是不可能的。
    一九四九年七月三日，贝鲁特主席就华沙建设六年计划所作的报告内，曾指出：
    “华沙的建设计划并不是不公平地仅仅考虑到这个首都的需要和仅仅为了满足整个国家的要求。这一个计划是建设华沙的计划，而华沙是社会主义国家的首都，这首都，影响着而且鼓舞着整个国家，将要促进而且积蓄了社会主义建设的创造性的力量直到最辽远与最被忽视的地区。 “在我们的社会主义建设的前列是我们的首都——华沙。 “然而首都的建设不能看作是一件和整个国家的建设、和我们整个的政治与经济任务，不相关联的工作。华沙的建设以及我们国家内所有的市、县的建设，是我们对于和平事业的贡献，是要弄明白我们的民族文化的价值及其最辉煌的发展。苏联和其他人民民主国家也正从事于他们的受到战事损害的祖国的和平建设工作，而且，和我们一样，高度警觉地反对一切的挑拨战争的企图。在这伟大的创造性的工作中，和平民主阵营，——不可战胜的社会主义建设者阵营的力量，是一天天的强大起来了！”
    华沙的建设是伟大的和平、民主、社会主义阵营力量的壮大与事业的胜利的一部分。我们在短促的观光华沙的时期，感到和波兰人民同样的兴奋和骄傲。
    光荣归于英勇的华沙人民、英勇的波兰人民及其英明的领袖贝鲁特主席！
