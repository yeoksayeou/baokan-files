    How I Delved into Professional Work
    Yan Ming, Director of the Small Rolling Mill, Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    Delegate to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions

    In September 1949, I was transferred from the countryside to work in a factory. When I first entered the factory, I felt overwhelmed by all the machines. I didn't understand what rolling steel was or what a heating furnace was. I really didn't know where to start.

    At that time, the factory was just recovering, and the machines were idle more often than running. The output of finished steel products was low, and there were many rejects. I was anxious and frustrated, but I couldn't get involved. When problems arose, everyone had their own opinions, and I could only listen. I was the party branch secretary of the factory at the time, and I thought, how can I lead production like this? Without learning, understanding, and getting hands-on, I, the branch secretary, would become deaf and blind.

    So I decided to delve into professional work, determined to get production going no matter what.

    While doing Party work, I followed the workers around, asking questions and watching them work. By 1950, I had become familiar with the people, the operation processes, and the machinery. The more I learned, the more I realized that the rolling mill was the key to good or bad production. Whenever production was interrupted, 90 percent of the problems were with the rolling mill. I decided to learn it. To learn, I also worked alongside the workers. The quality of rolled steel mainly depends on the adjustment of the machine, which is a very meticulous operation, and it's not easy to master the rules. Sometimes, even a small adjustment of one millimeter can cause rejects. Every time I went to work, I watched closely and studied the workers' adjustment methods. Once, when rolling nine-millimeter round steel, it was fine to have one steel bar on the rollers, but two would produce rejects. After two shifts of workers tried to adjust it, they still couldn't fix it. I consulted a technician who came from a working-class background, but he couldn't explain the reason. At this point, I realized that relying solely on experience without understanding theory was not enough, and I had to study theory.

    In April 1952, I became the director of the factory. At that time, the production situation was still not good, and hundreds of tons of nine-millimeter round steel were being rejected. I and the technicians took turns going to the workshop and worked day and night for several days, but the problem remained unresolved. The workers said, "If the compression ratio is too large or too small, it will produce rejects." I didn't understand the relationship between the compression ratio and the groove profile. I organized technicians and veteran workers to hold three discussion meetings in a row, and finally discovered that the key problem was the unreasonable profile. The problem was clear, but there was no way to solve it. At this time, I naturally thought of relying on Soviet experts. I presented the problem to the expert, and he explained it very clearly, pointing out that the main reasons for the rejects were: one, poor operation; two, the profile not meeting the standards.

    With the help of the Soviet expert, who personally helped us design, the profile was modified. The product qualification rate increased from 82 percent to 88.8 percent; the steel recovery rate also increased from 90 percent to 99.6 percent.

    When the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign was launched in 1952, the higher authorities called on us to tap our potential. But where was the potential? I stood in front of the rolling mill every day, looking back and forth, and found that the various processes were unbalanced. It took seventeen seconds for a steel bar to go from the roughing mill to the finishing mill. The finishing mill was fast, and the roughing mill was slow. I pondered this and saw a clue. It was unreasonable for the roughing mill to run two steel bars at a time. It should run three at the same time, so as to fully supply the finishing mill and shorten the rolling cycle. I studied with the veteran workers and came up with a method of producing steel from holes one, three, and five simultaneously. As a result, the rolling time for one steel bar was reduced from seventeen seconds to twelve seconds, and the product increased from forty-seven bars in ten minutes to fifty-three bars.

    With the improvement of production, my own professional level has also gradually improved. Now, I am no longer completely ignorant of production technology issues, as I was at the beginning. But in the past, I mainly delved into production technology and production management issues. In the future, in addition to continuing to strengthen my studies, I will also strive to enrich my knowledge of business management.

### 我是怎样钻研业务的

    我是怎样钻研业务的
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂厂长
    出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会代表  燕鸣
    一九四九年九月，我从乡下调到工厂工作。初进工厂，看到许多机器都发矇，什么叫轧钢，什么叫加热炉，一点不懂。真不知从那里下手做起。
    当时工厂刚刚恢复，机器停的时候多，转的时候少；出产的钢材成品少、废品多。我急的跺脚，却插不上手。出了问题，大家说圆是圆，说方是方，自己只能听着。当时我是工厂的党总支书记，我想这怎能进行领导生产呢？不学、不懂、不摸门，我这个总支书记就要变成聋子、瞎子。
    于是我决心钻研业务，说啥也要把生产搞起来。
    我一面做党的工作，一面就跟工人转，随时问了就跟着下去看。到一九五○年，人熟了，操作过程和机器设备的情况也摸清楚了。越摸，越明白轧钢机是生产好坏的关键。凡是生产中断，百分之九十的毛病出在轧钢机上。我下决心学会它。为了学习，也实际动手和工人一起干过。轧钢质量好坏，最主要的靠机器的调整，这是一种很细致的操作，而且不容易掌握规律，有时调整的差一粍，就会造成废品。我每次上班都去瞅着，研究工人的调整方法。有一次，轧九粍的圆钢，辊子上走一根钢就好，走两根就出废品，经过两个班的工人调整，也弄不好。我向一个老工人出身的技术员请教，他到处找毛病，总讲不出道理，这时我了解到不懂理论光靠经验还是不行，一定得学习理论。
    一九五二年四月，我担任了厂长。当时生产的情况仍是不好，九粍圆钢一废好几百吨。我和技术人员轮班下车间，干了几天几夜，问题一样没解决。工人说：“压缩率稍大或稍小都要出废品。”我对压缩率和轧槽孔型的关系还不明白。我组织技术员和老工人一连开了三次座谈会，才发现了关键问题在于孔型不合理。问题明确了，但就是没法解决。这时，我自然就想到要依靠苏联专家，把问题提到专家面前，他讲得很明确，指出出废品的主要原因：一个是操作不好，一个是孔型不合乎标准。
    经过苏联专家亲自动手帮助我们设计，孔型改造好了。产品合格率从百分之八十二提高到百分之八十八点八；钢材收得率也从百分之九十提高到百分之九十九点六。
    一九五二年展开增产节约运动时，上级号召我们挖潜力。但潜力在那儿？我天天站在轧钢机面前，瞅来瞅去，发现各道工序是不平衡的。一根钢从毛轧机到光轧机，需十七秒钟。光轧快，毛轧慢，我琢磨了这件事，看出了一点门道。毛轧机走两根钢是不合理的，应当叫它同时走三根，这样就可以充分供给光轧机，缩短轧钢周期。我和老工人一道研究，想出一、三、五孔同时出钢的办法，结果一根钢轧压时间从十七秒降低到十二秒，产品由十分钟四十七根增至五十三根。
    随着生产的提高，我自己的业务水平也逐渐提高了。现在凡是关于生产技术问题，不像开头那样一窍不通了。但过去钻研的多半是生产技术和生产管理方面的问题，今后我除了继续加强学习外，还要努力充实经营管理方面的知识。
