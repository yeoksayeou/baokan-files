Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th—The U.S. Supreme Court on the 25th rejected the Rosenbergs' appeal for the third time.

This barbaric judgment by the U.S. Supreme Court was made under circumstances where the Rosenbergs resolutely rejected the coercion and enticement of the American judicial authorities, and where American progressive people collected new evidence proving that the American judicial authorities framed innocent people with false testimony. Two days before the Supreme Court made its ruling, on May 23rd, the American judicial authorities even floated the idea that if the Rosenbergs agreed to fabricate some "confessions" about the so-called "spy case," they could be exempted from the death penalty. However, the Rosenbergs loved truth more than life. From the day they were arrested, for more than two years, they have consistently maintained their innocence, that their case was purely manufactured by the American ruling clique, with the aim of intimidating peace-loving people.

In early May, at a rally of 10,000 people in New York, Branning, chairman of the National Committee for Fair Trial in the Rosenberg Case, announced to the assembly the new and powerful evidence collected proving that the American judicial authorities framed innocent people. One piece of evidence was a handwritten letter by Greenglass, the key witness on which the court's judgment was based, revealing the circumstances of his collusion with the FBI to fabricate false testimony; another piece of evidence was Greenglass's wife's description of Greenglass, which proved that Greenglass was accustomed to calling black white.

Seeing that forcing a confession had failed, and fearing that the conspiracy would be further exposed over time, the American judicial authorities were eager to execute the Rosenbergs so that the case could be "settled." Therefore, the U.S. Supreme Court announced on the 25th, after a hastily convened meeting, that it would reject the Rosenbergs' appeal; unable to offer any legitimate reason, it could only say that the Supreme Court had no power to mitigate the death sentence handed down by a lower-level federal court. The Supreme Court also decided to lift the stay of execution for the Rosenbergs during the appeal period.

The U.S. Supreme Court's actions aroused the anger of upright Americans. The National Committee for Fair Trial in the Rosenberg Case telegraphed Eisenhower on the 25th, requesting a reconsideration of the death sentence imposed on the Rosenbergs. The telegram said: "Millions of Americans, like tens of millions of people around the world, are shocked by the unfortunate and unbelievable decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to rehear the Rosenberg case and demand that you not take the lives of the Rosenbergs."

The Rosenbergs' defense attorney, Bloch, is prepared to again ask Eisenhower to rescind the court's unreasonable judgment.

    美国最高法院竟再次拒绝罗森堡夫妇的上诉
    美国人民要求艾森豪威尔撤消无理判决
    【新华社二十六日讯】纽约消息：美国最高法院二十五日第三次拒绝罗森堡夫妇的上诉。
    美国最高法院这一个横蛮的判决，是在罗森堡夫妇坚决拒绝美国司法当局的威迫利诱和美国进步人民搜集到新的证据证明美国司法当局以假见证陷害无辜的情况下作出的。在最高法院作出判决的前两天，五月二十三日，美国司法当局还放出空气，说只要罗森堡夫妇同意捏造一些关于所谓“间谍案”的“供辞”，他们就可以免除死刑。但是罗森堡夫妇爱真理更甚于生命。从被捕那天起，两年多来他们就一直坚持他们是无辜的，他们的案件纯粹是美国统治集团故意制造的，目的在威吓爱好和平人民。
    五月初，在纽约一万人的大会上，争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会主席布兰宁向大会宣布了搜集到的证明美国司法当局陷害无辜的新的有力证据，证明之一是作为法院判决的主要根据的见证人格林格拉斯亲笔写的一封信，这封信中透露了他和联邦调查局通同制造假见证的情形；另一证据是格林格拉斯的妻子关于格林格拉斯的介绍，这一介绍证明格林格拉斯是惯于指黑为白的。
    美国司法当局看到逼供失败，又怕日久阴谋更加败露，急于处死罗森堡夫妇，以便就此“定案”。因此，美国最高法院二十五日在一次匆匆举行的会议后宣布拒绝罗森堡夫妇的上诉；由于举不出正当理由，它只能说：最高法院无权减轻低一级联邦法院作出的死刑判决。最高法院还决定取消对罗森堡夫妇在上诉期间延期行刑的规定。
    美国最高法院的措施激起美国正直人民的愤怒。美国争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会二十五日打电报给艾森豪威尔，要求重新考虑横加在罗森堡夫妇身上的死刑判决。电报说：“千百万美国人民和全世界各地千千万万的人民一样，对美国最高法院拒绝重审罗森堡案的不幸的难以置信的决定感到震惊，并且向你要求不得杀害罗森堡夫妇的生命。”
    罗森堡夫妇的辩护律师布洛克已准备再次要求艾森豪威尔撤消法院的无理判决。
