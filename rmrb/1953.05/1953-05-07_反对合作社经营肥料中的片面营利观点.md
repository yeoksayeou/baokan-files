　　A Brief Comment on Economic Life
　　Oppose the One-Sided Profit-Seeking Viewpoint in Cooperative Management of Fertilizer
　　The price of cottonseed cake managed by supply and marketing cooperatives in Qingyuan, Wangdu, Wanxian, Mancheng and other counties in Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, was higher than the market price, which aroused dissatisfaction among local cooperative members. Many cooperative members turned to the market to buy fertilizer, and a large amount of fertilizer managed by cooperatives in these counties was stockpiled. As of March 25, Qingyuan County Cooperative had only completed 38.1 percent of the first quarter's fertilizer supply plan.
　　The reason why the price of cottonseed cake managed by these cooperatives was higher than the market price was that the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office had a serious one-sided profit-seeking viewpoint in the management of fertilizer business. Most of the fertilizer managed by Qingyuan, Wangdu and other county cooperatives was supplied by the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office's Baoding Production Materials Wholesale Station. The purchase cost of cottonseed cake for the Qingyuan County Cooperative was 667.84 yuan per kilogram; in order to reduce the difference between the cooperative price and the market price, the cooperative allocated it to the primary cooperatives at 652.29 yuan, losing 15.55 yuan per kilogram. The total purchase cost of cottonseed cake for the Yangcheng United Village Cooperative in Qingyuan County was 742 yuan per kilogram; although the cooperative sold it at a loss of 5 yuan per kilogram, it was still 17 yuan higher than the local market price. Both the county and primary level cooperatives lost money in the management of fertilizer, but the net profit of the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office's Baoding Production Materials Wholesale Station in the fertilizer business was as high as 8.98 percent, and even reached 11.8 percent at its highest.
　　Cooperatives in various counties of Baoding Prefecture have repeatedly expressed their opinions to the superior cooperatives, requesting a readjustment of fertilizer prices, but the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office has not adopted them. The above facts show that the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office's pure profit-seeking viewpoint is very serious. They have not only violated the spirit of "superior cooperatives serving subordinate cooperatives," but also undermined the economic accounting system of subordinate cooperatives. More seriously, they have hindered the smooth progress of fertilizer supply and affected spring plowing production.
　　The demand of the cooperatives in various counties of Baoding Prefecture for the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office to adjust fertilizer prices is completely correct. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Office should conscientiously overcome the one-sided profit-seeking viewpoint, disclose fertilizer costs, and re-determine reasonable profits, so as to avoid losses to subordinate cooperatives in their operations, in order to quickly adjust fertilizer prices and overcome the phenomenon of disconnection between cooperative prices and market prices.

### 反对合作社经营肥料中的片面营利观点

    反对合作社经营肥料中的片面营利观点
    河北省保定专区清苑、望都、完县、满城等县供销合作社经营的棉籽饼价格高于市价，引起了当地社员群众的不满。许多社员群众转向市场购买肥料，这些县的合作社所经营的肥料就大批积压起来了。清苑县合作社到三月二十五日为止，仅完成第一季度供肥计划的百分之三十八点一。
    这些合作社经营的棉籽饼的价格高于市价的原因，是河北省合作总社在经营肥料业务中有严重的片面营利观点。清苑、望都等县合作社经营的肥料，大部是由河北省合作总社驻保定生产资料批发栈供应的。清苑县合作社每斤棉籽饼的进货成本是六六七点八四元；该社为了缩小合作社价和市价的差额，就以六五二点二九元拨给基层社，每斤亏本一五点五五元。清苑县阳城联村社每斤棉籽饼的进货总成本是七四二元；该社虽以每斤亏本五元的价格出售，还高于当地市价十七元。县社和基层社两级合作社经营肥料都亏本，但河北省合作总社驻保定生产资料批发栈在经营肥料业务中的纯利却高达百分之八点九八，最高时竟达到百分之十一点八。
    保定专区各县合作社曾数次向上级社提出意见，请求重新调整肥料价格，但河北省合作总社并未采纳。上述事实说明：河北省合作总社的单纯营利观点是十分严重的。他们既违反了“上级社为下级社服务”的精神，也破坏了下级社的经济核算制度，更严重的是妨碍了供应肥料工作的顺利进行，影响了春耕生产。
    保定专区各县合作社要求河北省合作总社调整肥料价格，这是完全正确的。河北省合作总社应当认真克服片面营利观点，公开肥料成本，重新确定合理利润，不要使下级社在经营中发生亏累现象，以便迅速调整肥料价格，克服社价和市价脱节现象。
