National Mass Song Awards, East China Preliminary Selection Concluded

In order to encourage and commend outstanding mass song creations, the Ministry of Culture will hold a mass song awards event in 1953 for songs created in the three years (October 1, 1949, to October 1, 1952). To this end, the East China Administrative Committee's Bureau of Culture formed the "National Mass Song Awards, East China Preliminary Selection Committee," with He Luting as the chairman, and Wu Qiang, Zhang Mei, and Xia Bai as vice-chairmen. Ding Shandé, Situ Han, Zhou Xiaoyan, Dong Yuan, Deng Erjing, and representatives from various provinces, totaling nineteen people, served as committee members.

A total of fifty-eight songs were recommended by the provinces and cities of East China to participate in the selection. These songs first underwent preliminary review and sorting by the selection team and were then submitted to the committee for discussion and approval. The meeting conducted a serious analysis and study of each work based on the selection criteria issued by the central government—the ideological and artistic merit of the work and its popularity among the masses. The meeting lasted for ten days from March 30th to April 8th, and finally selected nineteen songs, including "The Sun Comes Out, the Sky is Red." Most of these songs were created on the basis of national music, and were fresh works that were popular among the broad masses. They had all been popular among different groups of people. Therefore, the committee believed that they could be submitted to the National Mass Song Awards Committee for evaluation. At the same time, the meeting also criticized some generalized works that simply imitated folk songs in form and absorbed unhealthy elements from folk songs.

Jinzhou Folk Artists Perform for Volunteer Army Wounded and Sick Soldiers

Jinzhou folk artists frequently go to hospitals to give慰问 performances to Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers, assist hospitals in organizing entertainment evenings, and sing at the hospital's wired broadcasting station. From May 1952 to the present, they have performed a total of seventy-three times, with performances including drum songs, 快书, small-scale singing, shadow puppet shows, 单弦, crosstalk, and more.

In order to sing new programs for the Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers, the artists overcame the difficulty of their low cultural level and bought new ballad scripts to practice singing. He Tingyu, an old artist who is blind, also actively participated in the 慰问 performances for the Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers. After each performance, comrades from the hospital's broadcasting station wanted to drive him back, but he politely declined. Their enthusiasm for serving the Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers deeply moved the wounded and sick soldiers. Many comrades said, "The people of the motherland are truly concerned about us. We must rest assured and recuperate, strive to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible, return to the front lines, and answer the love of the people of the motherland with the victory of battle."

Yuezhong Area Film Projection Teams Go to the Countryside, Receiving Universal Welcome from Farmers

Farmers in various parts of the Yuezhong area universally welcome film projection teams to go to the countryside to show films. According to statistics for three months in 1953, the twelve rural film projection teams in the Yuezhong area screened a total of five hundred and twenty-five films, with a total audience of 1,328,000 people. Film screenings in rural areas have a great educational effect on farmers. Many areas use film screenings in coordination with central work, and have achieved good results.

Mount Emei Ancient Sites Undergoing Renovation

The Sichuan Provincial People's Government is carrying out the renovation of the ancient sites on Mount Emei. Mount Emei is one of China's famous summer resorts. In old China, due to years of warlord infighting, many of Mount Emei's cultural relics and ancient sites were damaged. Last year, the People's Government began the renovation work, and various hotels were newly built on the mountain, ready to receive guests who came from afar to visit.

Recently, the snow on the top of Mount Emei has melted, and the renovation project has gradually moved from the foot and waist of the mountain to the top. The workers are striving to complete the renovation of the main scenic spots and historical sites of Mount Emei before the Dragon Boat Festival this year.
