	May Sunlight Shines on Prague
	Zhu Ziqi
	This is a warm spring. The sky is exceptionally clear and lovely, with lilacs and pear blossoms blooming throughout the city. May sunlight shines on Prague, illuminating the capital of the Czechoslovak Republic, known as the "City of Gardens" and the "City of Art." The days of May are the most beautiful days of this beautiful city!
	May brings Prague a series of grand festivals and joyous events: May Day, Liberation Day on May 9th, the anniversary of the victory over Fascist Germany, the celebration of the decisive final year of the Five-Year Plan, the award ceremony for the 1953 Republic Medals and Labor Medals, the presentation of National Prizes, as well as the International Music Festival "Prague Spring" and other international activities.
	During these days, the entire city is as if woven from red flags and colorful flowers. Whether on the streets or in the squares, whether in factories or dormitories, the four endearing figures of Stalin, Malenkov, Gottwald, and Zápotocký appear everywhere; two solemn flags wave everywhere: the Czechoslovak and Soviet flags; and the songs praising a happy life and peaceful labor resound everywhere: "Reach out your hands! Friends! Greet May with creation and meritorious deeds!"
	The people of Prague deeply understand that the best gift to dedicate to May is increased production, conservation, and strenuous labor.
	The working people of factories, enterprises, and agricultural production cooperatives have all plunged into the upsurge of the production competition movement to celebrate May. Newspapers and "Labor Harvest Boards" on the streets publish news of new records and over-fulfilled production targets every day. On the performance charts at the entrances of metalworking factories, the red electric mercury continues to rise: 103 percent completion of the task in January, 108 percent in February, 118 percent in March, 121 percent in April...
	The figures in the summary of production achievements for the first quarter of 1953, announced in early May and known as the "Labor Victory Report," show that not only has industrial production increased, such as steel output increasing to 126 percent of the first quarter of last year's production, drilling machines to 3.8 times, automobiles to 3.6 times, etc., but also agricultural production has seen unprecedented increases, such as bread at 126 percent of last year, rye flour at 125 percent, and the sowing of important food crops such as potatoes and other spring plowing have also generally exceeded the plan. This year's main agricultural products have exceeded the plan, which is a significant event in the economic life of the Czechoslovak people.
	This year is the final year of the Five-Year Plan, and the decisive victories achieved in production over the past four years have continuously increased the material well-being of the broad masses of the people. For example, the number of radios, electric washing machines, refrigerators, bicycles, and motorcycles purchased by the people in four years exceeds the total number purchased in twenty years under the previous bourgeois republic. There are now more than 2.8 million radios in the country—that is, almost one in every household. On this year's May Day, Czechoslovakia's first domestically produced new-style television set began broadcasting. In the near future, people will be able to watch plays and listen to songs at home. Recently, many factories and institutions in Prague have increased wages and salaries. State department stores and shops are crowded with customers. Workers push newly produced motorcycles, agricultural production cooperative members carry newly purchased clothing and leather shoes, and staff members carry radios out of the shops with joyous expressions.
	May is Czechoslovakia's "gathering of heroes," and Prague is gathering outstanding worker representatives and labor models from all over the country. Various conferences are held in this national political, economic, and cultural center: the Steel Workers' Congress, the Mining Activists' Conference, the Fourth Light Industry Workers' Congress, the Tobacco Industry Representatives' Conference, etc. On the streets and trams, you will see passersby looking with admiration at those wearing new clothes and gold-shining "Prague's Most Honored Guest" medals on their chests. Many young men and women surround them to shake their hands and greet them.
	This year, a grand award ceremony was held in the Spanish Hall of the Presidential Palace. Most of the award recipients are labor models with outstanding achievements in production. More than thirty people received the "Republic Medal," and more than eighty people received the "Labor Medal." Artists painted portraits of many award recipients into large oil paintings and hung them at street corners and squares. Mass rallies celebrating the award recipients are being held everywhere. A poem praising labor and creation is popular here—"Ode to Glory":
	Glory belongs to labor, to those who single-mindedly create happiness!
	Glory belongs to the heavy work of wielding the great axe and gripping the iron plow!
	Glory belongs to those shock workers who toil day and night with sweat on their brows!
	Glory belongs to all the masters of this new society who have nothing to do with profit and selfishness!…
	Prague is also a city with very active cultural and artistic activities.
	Czechoslovakia's Fifth National "Drama Harvest Festival" was held here not long ago. The opera "The Bartered Bride" was performed on the opening day. This is the most outstanding program in classical drama and is the masterpiece of the world-famous Czech "Father of Music" and great composer Smetana in the nineteenth century. This May is the 87th anniversary of the play's premiere. It has been performed more than two thousand times at the Prague National Theatre. But even today, you can still see long lines of ticket buyers crowding at the entrance of the theater, all proud to have the opportunity to watch this famous play.
	In May, the programs performed in Prague theaters include not only many dramas, folk song and dance dramas, and excellent puppet shows reflecting the new life of the Czechoslovak people, but also famous plays from other countries. Such as the Soviet "The Government Inspector," "The Young Guard," and the Romanian classical drama "A Lost Letter," etc. Progressive dramas from capitalist countries, such as the famous French drama "Colonel Foster Pleads Guilty," which once caused a sensation in Europe, have also been performed here.
	During these days, nearly one hundred cinemas in Prague are showing dozens of films. The most outstanding of these is the famous film "Forward March," which is offered as a "May Film Tribute" and is adapted from the novel by the famous Czechoslovak writer and National Prize winner Erzhsha. Among the many foreign films are the Soviet "May Night" and "Lenin Canal," as well as the Chinese "Red Flag on Cui Gang," the Korean "Return to the Front," and films from Germany, Hungary, Poland, and other countries. Sometimes you can also see progressive films from capitalist countries such as France, Italy, Indonesia, Britain, and the United States.
	Among the cultural activities in May, there are also exhibitions held simultaneously in various parts of the city. Their rich content and beautiful forms attract large numbers of viewers. People from foreign countries say, "Prague is a city of exhibitions," while the Czechoslovak people say, "Exhibitions are a good school."
	In the "Glorious Past and Great Future" exhibition, people can see the historical deeds of Jan Hus, the great religious reformer and patriot who was the "honor and pride of the Czech nation" in the fifteenth century, as well as Jan Žižka, the national hero who inherited Hus's ideas to resist foreign invasion and oppose feudal aristocrats; from the "Gifts to Gottwald Exhibition," people can see the immortal feats made by this great communist fighter and leader of the Czechoslovak people, and the love, gratitude, and remembrance of the broad masses of people for him; people can also see from the "Our Second President—The Life and Works of Worker Zápotocký" exhibition the long and combative path taken by him in leading the Czechoslovak working class, as well as the rich literary works he wrote reflecting these battles; people can also see from another special exhibition the life and deeds of the Lenin Order recipient, President of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Niyedli, who is known as the "banner of contemporary European advanced scientists." This old man has made outstanding contributions in science, culture, and social activities. His famous saying, "Friendship with the Soviet Union is the greatest friendship of mankind," is well known in Czechoslovakia.
	In May, the Czechoslovak government announced the list of recipients of the 1953 "National Prize." There are more than sixty award recipients, including experts in science, culture, and art. The first prize is 200,000 crowns (Czech currency). Professor Katydov of Natural Sciences won the first prize in science for creating a measurement theory to solve complex mathematical equations. The literary works that won the first prize include the female writer Buyimamanwa's "Decisive Battle of Life and Death," the Writers Association Chairman Delda's "Beautiful Dolki," and the poet Niezval's collection of poems "Wings," etc. In commenting on these works, the "Red Rights Daily," the organ of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, said: "These excellent works have all been tested among the masses and approved by the broad readership, and they all conform to the sole correct purpose of our artistic creation: 'Struggling for peace, for socialism, and for new people.'"
	Prague is the location of many international organizations. The World Peace Council, which is supported and loved by the broad masses of people around the world, is located here. There is also the International Student Union, which leads the student movements of various countries. Not long ago, the International Broadcasting Conference was held here, and the famous International Music Festival—"Prague Spring"—will soon open grandly here.
	The famous French poet Aragon once enthusiastically praised this beautiful city at a meeting commemorating Hugo in the music hall here last year. He said: "Prague is the concentration point and the starting point of the peace movement. Prague is a bridge for economic, cultural exchange, and friendly relations between the West and the East!" Friends from Western countries often say: "When we arrive in Prague, it is like stepping into the gate of a new society." And the Soviets or Chinese who go to the West say: "When we leave Prague, it is like leaving our own home."
	The people living in Prague are happy and joyful. And every Prague resident deeply understands how close and important a relationship every happy thing that happens here and every job completed here has with the great liberation festival of May 9th. People say: "On May 9th, the Soviet Red Army brought us the People's Republic, brought us land and freedom, brought us a happy life and the prosperity of a great future!"
	Now, when people live happily in this beautiful "City of a Hundred Spires," peacefully sitting in the magnificent opera house enjoying music, or freely entering the ancient buildings of museums and art palaces, when mothers are rocking their babies to sleep in comfortable housing and children are studying quietly in well-equipped schools, when people receive their full wages or salaries every month, when young people think of a bright future and see the motherland prospering and becoming stronger every day, how can they not thank the Soviet Union? How can they not always remember and be grateful to their most beloved teacher and friend—the great Comrade Stalin?
	In the days of May, the people of Prague look with particular affection at the highest point in the city center—Letná Hill. On that hill, hundreds of Czechoslovakia's finest stonemasons and artists are rushing to build a Stalin Memorial, more than thirty feet high and weighing more than eight hundred and sixty tons, made of the world's finest light red granite. Like a loving mother protecting her beloved son, the image of the great leader will eternally protect the growth of this beautiful city and country…
	This is a warm spring. May sunlight shines on Prague, shining on a city full of labor enthusiasm and international friendship, shining on the gold characters hanging high on Letná Hill: "Under the banner of Lenin-Stalin, loyal to the cause of Gottwald, march towards socialism!" Under the call of this slogan, we hear the sound of Prague's march in May, we hear the sound of Czechoslovakia's march forward, one of the glorious "shock brigades" in the camp of peace and democracy.

    五月的阳光照耀着布拉格
    朱子奇
    这是温暖的春天。天空格外晴朗可爱，紫丁香花和梨花开遍全城。五月的阳光照耀着布拉格，照耀着这被人们称为“花园之城”和“艺术之城”的捷克斯洛伐克共和国的首都。五月的日子，是这个美丽城市的最美丽的日子！
    五月给布拉格带来了一连串的盛大节日和喜事：五一劳动节、五九解放节、庆祝战胜法西斯德国纪念日、庆祝五年计划决定性的最后一年、一九五三年共和国奖章与劳动奖章授奖典礼和国家奖金的颁布，以及举行国际音乐比赛节—“布拉格之春”和其他国际活动。
    在这些日子里，整个城市像用红旗和彩花编制成的一样。无论是街道上或广场上，无论是工厂里或宿舍里，到处出现着四个亲切的形象：斯大林、马林科夫、哥特瓦尔德和萨波托斯基；到处飘扬着两面庄严的旗帜：捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的国旗；到处响亮着赞美幸福的生活与和平的劳动的歌声：“伸出手来！朋友们！用创造和功勋迎接五月！”
    布拉格人民深深了解：献给五月最好的礼物是增产节约和紧张的劳动。
    各工厂、企业和农业生产合作社的劳动人民，都投入了庆祝五月的生产竞赛运动热潮中。报纸上和街头的“劳动收获牌”上，每天公布着创造新纪录和超额完成生产任务的消息。在金属加工工厂门口的成绩表上，红色的电光水银不断上升：一月份完成任务百分之一零三，二月份百分之一零八，三月份百分之一一八，四月份百分之一二一……
    在五月初公布的被人们称为“劳动胜利战报”的一九五三年第一季生产成绩总结的数字上，可以看出不仅工业方面如钢的产量增加为去年第一季生产量的百分之一二六，钻孔机为三点八倍，汽车为三点六倍等等，而且农业品方面也是空前的增产，如面包为去年的百分之一二六，裸麦粉为百分之一二五，重要食粮马铃薯的播种工作及其他农作物的春耕也普遍超过计划。今年主要的农产品已超过了计划，这是捷克斯洛伐克人民经济生活中具有重大意义的事件。
    今年是五年计划最后一年，过去四年多的生产取得了决定的胜利，使得广大人民的物质福利不断增进。如在四年中人民购买收音机、电力洗衣机、冰箱、自行车和机器脚踏车的数目，就超过以前资产阶级共和国在二十年里所购的总数。现在全国已有二百八十多万人置有收音机。——就是说，差不多每家有一部了。今年五一节，捷克斯洛伐克自制的第一部新式电视机开始放映。今后不久，人们坐在家里就可以看戏听唱了。最近，布拉格许多工厂和机关，都增加了工资和薪金。国家百货公司和商店挤满了主顾。工人们推着新出品的机器脚踏车，农业生产合作社社员们拿着新置的服装和皮鞋，工作人员抱着收音机从铺子里喜气洋洋地走出来。
    五月是捷克斯洛伐克的“群英会”的日子，布拉格聚集着来自全国各地的优秀工人代表和劳动模范。在这个全国的政治、经济与文化中心举行了各种各样的会议：钢铁工人代表大会、矿工积极分子会议、第四届轻工业工人代表大会、烟草工业代表会议等。在马路上和电车上，你会看到行人用敬慕的眼光来看那些身穿新装、胸前挂着金光闪闪的
    “布拉格最高贵上宾”的奖牌的人们。许多青年男女见了他们就围上去和他们握手问候。
    今年五月在总统府的西班牙大厅中举行了盛大的授奖典礼。得奖者大都是在生产上有优异成绩的劳动模范。“共和国奖章”获得者有三十多名，“劳动奖章”获得者有八十多名。艺术家把许多得奖者的像画成大幅的油画，挂在街口和广场上。庆祝得奖者的群众集会在各处召开着。这里流行着一首赞美劳动和创造的诗歌—“光荣歌”：
    光荣属于劳动，属于一心创造幸福的人！
    光荣属于挥动大斧和紧握铁犁的沉重的工作！
    光荣属于那些汗流满面的日夜辛劳的突击手！
    光荣属于这一切和利润及自私毫不相干的新社
    会的主人！……
    布拉格同时是一个文化艺术活动非常活跃的城市。
    捷克斯洛伐克第五届全国“戏剧收获节”不久前在这里举行。在揭幕那天演出的是歌剧“被出卖的未婚妻”，这是古典剧中最优秀的节目，是十九世纪世界著名的捷克“音乐之父”、大作曲家斯密达的杰作。今年五月是该剧上演的第八十七周年纪念。它在布拉格国家剧院已演出了二千余次。但直到今天，你还可以看到长长的购票者的队伍拥挤在剧院门口，他们都以得到观赏这个名剧的机会为荣。
    布拉格剧场在五月间上演的节目，除了许多反映捷克斯洛伐克人民新生活的话剧、民间歌舞剧和优秀的木偶戏外，还有其他国家的名剧。如苏联的
    “钦差大臣”、“青年近卫军”以及罗马尼亚的古典名剧“遗失了的信件”等等。资本主义国家的进步戏剧如曾经轰动欧洲的法国名剧“福斯特上校服罪了”，也曾在这里上演过。
    在这些日子里，布拉格的将近一百家电影院放映着数十部影片。其中最出色的是作为“五月电影献礼”的名片“前进的步伐”，这是根据捷克斯洛伐克的著名作家、国家奖金获得者尔热沙的小说改编摄制而成的。在许多外国影片中有苏联的“五月之夜”和“列宁运河”，也有中国的“翠岗红旗”，朝鲜的“重返前线”和德国、匈牙利、波兰等国家的片子。有时也能看到法、意、印尼、英、美等资本主义国家的进步影片。
    在五月的文化活动中，还有在市内各处同时举行的展览会。它们的丰富的内容和优美的形式吸引着大批的观众。从外国来的人说“布拉格是展览会之城”，而捷克斯洛伐克人民则说：“展览会是所好学校”。
    在“光荣的过去和伟大的将来”的展览会中，人们可以看到十五世纪“捷克民族的荣誉和骄傲”—伟大的宗教改革者和爱国主义者扬·胡斯，以及继承胡斯思想抵抗外族侵略及反对封建贵族的民族英雄扬·息希卡的历史事迹；从“献给哥特瓦尔德礼物展览会”中，人们可以看到这位伟大共产主义战士和捷克斯洛伐克人民的领袖所作出的不朽功勋，和广大人民群众对他的热爱、感激与怀念；人们也可从“我们的第二任总统—工人萨波托斯基的生平与创作”展览会上，看到他领导捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级所走过的漫长的战斗道路，以及他所写下的反映这些战斗的丰富的文学作品；人们还可从另一个专门的展览会上看到被称为“当代欧洲先进科学家之旗”的列宁勋章获得者捷克斯洛伐克科学院院长尼耶德利的生平和事迹。这位老人在科学文化和社会活动方面有着杰出的贡献。他的名言“对苏联的友谊是人类最伟大的友谊”，在捷克斯洛伐克国内是尽人皆知的。
    五月间，捷克斯洛伐克政府公布了一九五三年
    “国家奖金”获得者的名单。得奖者共有六十多人，包括科学、文化、艺术各部门的专家。头等奖金二十万克郎（捷币）。自然科学教授卡铁多夫以创造解决复杂数学方程式的测量理论获得科学方面第一奖。文学作品得头奖的有女作家布依玛曼娃的
    “生和死的决战”，作家协会主席德尔达的“美丽的多尔基”和诗人涅兹瓦尔的诗集“翅膀”等作品。捷共中央机关报“红色权利报”在评论这些作品时说：“这些优秀的作品都是在群众中经过考验而为广大读者所批准了的，都是符合我们艺术创作的唯一正确的‘为和平、为社会主义、为新人物而斗争’的宗旨的。”
    布拉格是许多国际组织的所在地。为全世界广大人民群众所拥护和爱戴的世界和平理事会就设在这里。还有领导各国学生运动的国际学生联合会等。不久前，在这里举行了国际广播事业会议，著名的国际音乐节——“布拉格之春”不日也将在这里隆重开幕。
    著名的法国诗人阿拉贡去年在此间音乐大厅纪念雨果的会上，曾经热情地颂扬过这个美丽的城市。他说：“布拉格，是和平运动的集中点和它的出发点。布拉格，是西方和东方经济、文化交流与友谊往来的桥梁！”从西方国家来的朋友常常说：“当我们到达布拉格时，就像是踏进了新社会的大门。”而到西方去的苏联人或中国人则说：“当我们离开布拉格时，就像是离开自己的家一样。”
    在布拉格生活着的人们是快乐的和幸福的。而每一个布拉格人都深深了解：在这里所发生的每一件快乐事情，在这里所完成的每一件工作，与五月九日这个伟大的解放节日有着何等密切和重要的关系呵。人们说：“五月九日，苏联红军给我们带来了人民的共和国，带来了土地和自由，带来了幸福的生活和伟大的未来的繁荣！”
    如今，当人们幸福地生活在这美好的“百塔之城”，安宁地坐在辉煌的歌剧院欣赏音乐，或者自由地进入古老建筑的博物馆和艺术宫时，当母亲们在安适的住房里摇着自己的婴儿入睡和孩子们在设备完善的学校里静心念书时，当人们每月领到丰满的工资或薪金时，当青年人想到远大的前程和看到祖国一天天繁荣富强时，他们怎么会不感谢苏联呢？怎么会不永远怀念和感激他们最敬爱的导师和朋友——伟大的斯大林同志呢？
    在五月的日子里，布拉格的人们以特别亲切的心情去注视那城市中心的最高点—列特纳山。在那座山上，几百名捷克斯洛伐克最优秀的石匠工人和艺术家们，正在赶筑一座高达三丈多和重八百六十多吨的世界最精美的、由淡红色花岗石雕成的斯大林纪念像。像慈母卫护着爱子一样，伟大领袖的形象将永世卫护着这美丽的城市和国家的成长……。
    这是温暖的春天。五月的阳光照耀着布拉格，照耀着充满劳动热忱和国际友谊的城市，照耀着列特纳山上高高挂起的金字：“在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下，忠于哥特瓦尔德的事业，向社会主义前进！”在这个标语的号召下，我们听见了这五月的布拉格前进的步伐声，听见了这个和平、民主阵营里的光荣的“突击队”之一——捷克斯洛伐克前进的步伐声。
