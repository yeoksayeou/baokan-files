    Chaos in Cooperation in Qinglong County, Guizhou Province; Unable to Serve Farmer Members Well

    Zhang Yulin of the Finance and Economics Committee of Qinglong County, Guizhou Province, writes: There is serious chaos in the work of the Qinglong County Cooperative Union. The business policy of the cooperative is very unclear. It is said verbally that the cooperative serves its members, and the higher-level cooperative serves the lower-level cooperative, but the actual situation is completely different. The business of the cooperative is not oriented to the vast number of farmer members, but mainly focuses on the consumption supply in the urban area of the county seat. Therefore, the variety of daily necessities supplied by the cooperative's store in the county seat is very large, and the turnover is more than three times that of the supply to the rural areas of the whole county. However, in the countryside, the cooperative has not completed even 10% of its planned purchase of local and special products in the first quarter; the supply of agricultural production materials is even worse. Many grassroots cooperatives cannot buy agricultural tools from the county cooperative, and most of the agricultural tools owned by the county cooperative are not up to specifications and are of poor quality, which farmers are very critical of.

    Although the cooperative also has plans for purchasing and supplying goods, the plans are made behind closed doors and have no effect at all. For example, the "other" item in the cooperative's annual purchase plan accounts for one-half of the total purchase amount; but Li Chunfang, the head of the planning section, does not know what the "other" item includes.

    The chaos in the cooperative's financial system is even more intolerable. For the past two years, there have been no records of the transfer of goods between the county cooperative and the grassroots cooperative, or between the production section and the supply section of the county cooperative; sometimes, the store does not record the sale of goods, and the extra money is deposited in the bank in a private name. As a result, the final accounts for 1952 could not be settled, so the cooperative simply did not settle them, and started new accounts in 1953. If this continues, this year's final accounts will still be a problem.

    Because the cooperative has the above serious problems, it has suffered huge losses. In January of this year alone, the loss exceeded ten million yuan. If this continues, the members' shares will soon be eaten up. The various grassroots cooperatives are also unable to maintain themselves. For example, the grassroots cooperative in the fourth district can only maintain one month's expenses with four months of profits. When the grassroots cooperatives report the situation, Zhang Jizeng, the director of the county cooperative union, says: "Isn't the county cooperative union also losing money! We'll talk about it after we lose money!" Therefore, the cadres of the grassroots cooperatives are now very uneasy about their work.

### 贵州晴隆县合作社工作很乱  不能很好为农民社员服务

    贵州晴隆县合作社工作很乱  不能很好为农民社员服务
    贵州省晴隆县财经委员会章玉林来信：晴隆县合作社联合社工作中有着严重的混乱现象。该社经营方针很不明确，口头上说是合作社为社员服务，上级社为下级社服务，但实际情况却完全是另一回事。该社业务不是面向广大的农民社员，而是以城关区的消费供应为主，因此该社县城门市供应的日用品品种很多，营业额要超过全县农村供应的三倍以上。但在农村中，该社第一季度土、特产收购计划还没完成百分之十；农业生产资料的供应工作做得更差，不少基层社向县社买农具买不到，而县社所有的一些农具多半不合规格，且质量很差，农民们很有意见。
    该社的收购、供应工作虽然也有计划，但计划都是关着门造的，根本不起作用。如该社全年收购计划中“其他”一项要占总收购额的二分之一；但 “其他”项究竟包括那些东西，计划股长李春芳都不知道。
    该社财务制度的混乱情况更使人不能容忍。两年来，县社和基层社间，县社生产股和供应股间货物往来都不记账；门市部有时卖了东西未记账，多出了钱就以私人名义存在银行里。一九五二年的决算，因而结不出来，该社也就不结了，一九五三年又另立新账。这样下去，今年的决算仍成问题。
    由于该社有着以上严重问题，所以亏损很大，仅今年一月份即亏千万元以上。如此下去，社员的股金很快要被吃光。各基层社也是无法维持，如第四区基层社，四个月的盈利才可以维持一个月的开支。基层社把情况反映上来，县联社主任张继增却说：“县联社还不是赔吗！赔了以后再说！”因此，现在基层社干部工作很不安心。
