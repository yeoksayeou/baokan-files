Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 22nd: Preparatory work is actively underway worldwide for the World Women's Congress, scheduled to open on June 5th at the Copenhagen Sports Palace. Women from more than eighty countries have announced they will send delegates to the Congress. Women from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will send large delegations to report on their achievements and happy lives, where women enjoy equal rights in law and in practice. In the German Democratic Republic, the women's conference held in Berlin on May 20th elected thirty-nine delegates and raised 160,000 marks to help women from colonial and dependent countries participate in the Congress.

    All European countries will send representatives to Copenhagen. Women in Italy, France, and Great Britain have already selected their delegates. In these countries, foreign orders and war preparations cannot stifle the democratic women's movement, nor can they stifle the growing peace movement. The Scandinavian countries will send large delegations and observers. Finnish women are preparing a special gift for the Congress, a book of Finnish women's rights. In recent weeks, women in Finnish factories and villages have written their names and demands in the book of rights.

    In Asian and Middle Eastern countries – Iran, Iraq, and Egypt – where feudal customs, prohibitions, and the most shameful exploitation keep women in a state of slavery, women have long been engaged in a heroic struggle for basic human dignity. The call to convene the World Women's Congress has been warmly welcomed in these countries. The National Preparatory Conference of India elected a delegation of thirty women. Indian women have also widely conducted activities such as collecting peace signatures, raising gifts, and holding photo exhibitions.

    Women in Latin American countries have welcomed the convening of the World Women's Congress with great enthusiasm. The women among the 80,000 striking Brazilian textile workers will send four delegates to the Congress. It has been announced that Brazil will send a total of fourteen delegates. In Venezuela and Bolivia, two women's organizations have been established to celebrate this event. Mexican women have already held a national conference of peasant women, at which it was decided to send a delegation to the World Women's Congress. Twenty Argentine women are on their way to Denmark, including textile and tobacco workers, rural women, housewives, and intellectuals.

    Representatives of the fighting Korean women will participate in the Congress, who today hope more fervently than anyone else that peace can finally descend upon their country. They will present evidence and warnings at the Congress, explaining what today's war means to the people, and using their own experiences to encourage women in all countries to strive more actively for peace.

    American women – whose children are being sent to participate in the brutal war of aggression against Korea – will also participate in the Congress. American women have organized a preparatory committee, whose initiators include prominent figures in the American women's community, Mrs. Kingsbury, the famous black educator and civil rights fighter Mary Church Terrell, and others. The initiators have sent letters supporting the World Women's Congress, stating: "We live together today in one world. As givers of life and protectors of posterity, we have a common bond with all women, and we cannot solve our problems separately from other women in the world."

    世界妇女大会筹备工作进入完成阶段
    八十多国妇女宣布将派遣代表参加大会
    【新华社柏林二十二日电】世界妇女大会订于六月五日在哥本哈根体育大厦召开，迎接大会的筹备工作正在全世界各国积极地进行着。八十多国的妇女宣布将派遣代表参加大会。苏联和人民民主国家的妇女将派遣庞大的代表团来报告她们的成就和幸福的生活，在她们的国家里，妇女在法律与实际生活中都享有平等权利。在德意志民主共和国，五月二十日在柏林举行的妇女会议选出了三十九名代表，并募集了十六万马克来帮助殖民地与附属国妇女参加大会。
    所有的欧洲国家都要派代表到哥本哈根来。意大利、法国和英国妇女已经选出她们的代表。在这些国家里，外国人的命令和战争准备既不能扼杀民主妇女运动，也不能扼杀日益发展壮大的和平运动。斯堪的纳维亚国家将派遣人数众多的代表团和列席代表。芬兰妇女正在准备献给大会的特别礼物，芬兰妇女的权利书。在最近几周中，芬兰工厂和乡村的妇女在权利书上写下了她们的名字和要求。
    在亚洲和中近东国家——伊朗、伊拉克和埃及，封建习惯、禁例和最可耻的剥削使妇女过着奴隶生活，妇女们长期以来就在进行着争取起码的人类尊严的英勇斗争。召开世界妇女大会的号召在这些国家里受到极热烈的欢迎。印度的全国筹备会议选出了由三十名妇女组成的代表团，印度妇女并广泛举行了征集和平签名、募集礼品和举办图片展览会等活动。
    拉丁美洲各国的妇女都以巨大的热情欢迎世界妇女大会的召开。八万名参加罢工的巴西纺织工人中的妇女将要派遣四名代表参加大会。据宣布，巴西派遣的代表共十四人。在委内瑞拉和玻利维亚，为了庆祝这件大事成立了两个妇女组织。墨西哥妇女已经举行了全国农民妇女大会，会上决定派遣一个代表团参加世界妇女大会。有二十名阿根廷妇女正在来丹麦途中，其中有纺织工人和烟草工人、农村妇女、家庭主妇和知识分子。
    战斗的朝鲜妇女的代表将要参加大会，她们今天比任何人都更热烈地希望和平最后可以降临她们的国土。她们将在大会上提出证据和警告，说明今天的战争对人民意味着什么，用她们亲身的经历唤起各国妇女更积极地争取和平。
    美国妇女——就是她们的孩子被派去参加残忍的侵略朝鲜战争——也将参加大会。美国妇女已组织了筹备委员会，在发起人中有美国妇女界名流金斯伯利夫人、名黑人教育家、争取民权的战士玛丽·彻契·戴列尔等人。发起人已经发出信件支持世界妇女大会，信件说：“我们今天共同生活在一个世界上。作为生命的给予者和后代的保护者，我们和全体妇女有着共同的联系，我们是不能脱离世界上的其他妇女来单独解决我们的问题的。”
