Spring in Anshan

Gu Lei Wu Shaoqi

This year, spring in Anshan is even more exciting. Never before has Anshan seen such a thriving construction scene.

In the northwest corner of the city, smoke and dust fill the air all day long, and the sound of machines roars. New projects have begun! High in the sky, on the ground, and underground, everywhere there are people working: jackhammer operators are attacking the old reinforced concrete foundations; welders are working on the steel skeleton, with sparks scattering; riggers wearing safety belts are working at dizzying heights; concrete workers holding tamping rods are tamping new concrete foundations; electrical workers are concentrating on creating the veins and nerves of the new project. The asphalt road that has been overturned is filled with dust all day long, and all kinds of heavy-duty trucks, cranes, universal loaders, horse-drawn rubber-tired carts, and handcarts form a living conveyor belt, turning non-stop from morning to night. The working class of Anshan is carrying out the country's first Five-Year Plan with extremely tense labor.

The blasting team at the Thin Plate Factory construction site gave a wonderful performance as soon as they entered the site. In March, their blasting task was to blast away 3,000 cubic meters of old foundations; but by the 20th, only 1,200 cubic meters had been completed. The workers knew the significance of completing the plan for the speed of Anshan's construction. A heroic assault work was launched. Originally, two people used one rock drill, but now it has become one person per machine, and cadres who were partially detached from production have also taken up machines. The outstanding rock drilling worker Shi Junlun, at this critical moment, in order to make the machine drill down faster, simply rode on the machine handle. The reinforced concrete foundation was more difficult to drill than stone, and the machine trembled under his legs like a machine gun firing. As a result, he drilled 50 meters a day with one machine, and then set a new record of 60 meters. Under such an assault, they completed 60 percent of the task in ten days and saved 40 percent of the labor.

In order to overcome time, the designers of the Design Institute carefully improved their working methods, studied the lessons learned from last year's design, and designed the No. 7 blast furnace in only two and a half months, which was four and a half months faster than designing the No. 8 blast furnace last year. This design was not only fast, but also greatly reduced errors.

In March of this year, the working class of Anshan has dedicated the country's first automated iron-smelting blast furnace to the motherland; the seamless steel pipe plant and the large rolling mill are installing machinery and carrying out partial trial runs, striving to put these highly automated equipment into operation this year to produce steel for the country. The newly started No. 7 blast furnace and the renovation project of the Thin Plate Factory will also be comparable to the aforementioned three major projects. The No. 7 blast furnace will be built into the largest and most automated blast furnace in China. Next year, when spring comes to Anshan again, the Thin Plate Factory will use automated equipment to manufacture tinplate, corrugated iron, and various thin iron plates that the motherland urgently needs; the No. 7 blast furnace will pour out molten iron on time; and large steel materials and seamless steel pipes will also be transported to various places. Before the completion of these projects, in the autumn of 1953, 200,000 square meters of new residences will appear in the suburbs, and 25,000 employees and their families will get beautiful and comfortable new homes here.

Faced with these technically complex and large-scale projects, the people of Anshan have unparalleled confidence. A year ago, modern construction technology was unfamiliar to the workers of Anshan, but after a year of practice, under the guidance of Soviet experts, they have begun to arm their minds and hands with the world's most advanced construction technology. When we visited the main construction sites and asked the workers whether they could overcome all difficulties in technology and advance rapidly, their answer was: "We certainly can!"

This answer is fully justified, and the No. 5 blower installed last year is a testament to it. This is a new type of equipment, and its high degree of automation makes it like a living animal. It can automatically adjust the number of revolutions and adjust the air pressure according to the needs of the blast furnace. It can automatically lubricate itself, and it can also automatically stop in case of danger; therefore, the requirements for installation technology are very strict. The main figures in the installation team—Captain Xia Shulin, team leaders Su Zhongxiao, Ding Chengzhi, and Li Chengjun—were all good at鉗工 (fitter's work) , but when they opened the box for the equipment, they could only recognize two large parts—"This is a turbine," "That is a blower," and they couldn't name anything else. Faced with this project, everyone didn't know where to start. But difficulties have never stopped the workers of Anshan. They humbly asked Soviet experts for advice and resolutely followed the technical guidance of Soviet experts. If it didn't work once, they would try again; as a result, they not only successfully installed the blower, but also created a miracle; the design required a centering tolerance of 0.04mm, and they actually achieved 0.005mm; the design required a vibration coefficient of less than 0.02mm, which is the world's first-class technical standard. When the No. 5 blower was running at a speed of more than 3,600 revolutions per minute, there was no vibration at all! This year, this installation team is carrying out new tasks at the No. 7 blast furnace construction site—installing two blowers, each 50 percent larger than last year's No. 5 blower. Su Zhongxiao and Ding Chengzhi's two teams have dared to contract one each, and Li Chengjun has contracted all of the return water system. The number of technical workers in the team has not increased, but everyone feels that the task given is too small, and they even ask: "Why not do three?" Last year, pre-installation took 70 days, but this year they decided to use only 30 days; last year, Soviet experts were helping them step by step, but this year they can watch them walk on their own. Xia Shulin said: "What I learned in the past year is equivalent to what I learned in the past 30 years, and they are all first-class technologies! This year, we also dare to guarantee that these two new blowers will be like the No. 5 blower, without any vibration!"

Zhou Xiangchen and his blasting team are equally outstanding. Last year, there was a complex project at the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant construction site called "Pillar Replacement"—lifting the steel pillars supporting the factory building's beams by 100mm and demolishing and re-pouring the concrete foundations of the steel pillars. The old steel pillar foundations could only be quickly removed by blasting with explosives, but the steel pillars were not allowed to be shaken at all during the blasting. Some people who did not believe that people could control the power of explosives advocated using manual labor to chisel, but three people worked hard all day, and the concrete they chiseled off was no bigger than a watermelon; even more clumsy was that someone even advocated using a winch to drag it out. At this time, Zhou Xiangchen came out. He learned some advanced methods of blasting rocks, coalfields, and frozen layers from Soviet experts. Based on these experiences, he repeatedly pondered and experimented on various old foundations, and finally developed a blasting method called "Small Cracks," which successfully cleared the old foundations of the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant. This year, Zhou Xiangchen is a section chief at the Thin Plate Factory construction site, and Zhang Runbo, a jackhammer operator who was originally in his blasting team, has become the blasting team leader here. Although they encountered more troublesome problems in the new task—the old concrete around the steel pillar foundations of the factory building had to be blasted away, but the steel pillar foundations connected to them were not allowed to be damaged; but Zhou Xiangchen said: "It doesn't matter, we have developed a new method again! With last year's experience, now even if there is a motor running five meters away, I dare to put explosives here!"

The famous mechanized construction team is even a living example of "from scratch, from small to large, from不懂 to懂 (not understanding to understanding)." Last year, when this team was first established, there were only four people, but now it has developed into a strong team of more than 500 people. In February last year, none of the drivers here had ever seen these new construction machines, let alone skillfully control them. Sometimes they raised the crane arm and didn't know how to lower it, and when they wanted it to turn to the right, it turned to the left when they moved the handle; now, these people can freely operate various machines and gallop on the construction site, becoming an indispensable "special forces." This year, new machines have been added here—diesel pile drivers, concrete pumps, and electric cranes. Not long after the equipment arrived, several young technicians and old workers were able to operate them.

These are not isolated cases. Here, our鉗工 (fitters), welders, electricians, concrete workers..., have mastered a lot of advanced technology. Many of last year's apprentices can now work independently, and many young male and female college students who have just graduated have become technical management cadres in construction. Some trainee technicians of the Mechanical Installation Team of the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant wrote a 25,000-word internship report each at the end of their internship, and they were all valuable technical special reports; an engineer told us: in the past, trainee technicians could only write three or five pages of reports at most at the end of their internship.

Looking at the path that the working class of Anshan has taken in the past year, we can understand the origin of their confidence. In modern, large-scale construction, enthusiasm alone is not enough, and technology occupies a particularly important position at present. The working class of Anshan, with the help of Soviet experts, has begun to master it!

This is the face of spring in Anshan. If the construction of Anshan last year was just the prelude to large-scale construction, then this year the working class of Anshan has shouldered a task twice as large as last year's, taking the lead in the country as the executor of the country's first Five-Year Plan. The achievements of Anshan's construction make the people of the motherland feel excited and encouraged. In turn, enthusiastic encouragement and support come from all over the country, and this connection is becoming stronger and stronger!

People often like to use "spring" and "dawn" to symbolize abundant life and the beginning of victory. The spring of Anshan has actually shown its identity to the people of the whole country and has been recognized by the people of the whole country! That is to say, the construction of Anshan represents the youth and future of the motherland, and the spring of Anshan belongs to the people of the motherland.

    春在鞍山
  　顾雷　吴少琦
    今年鞍山的春天更加令人兴奋。有史以来，鞍山还没有出现过这样繁盛的建设景象。
    在城市的西北角，终日烟尘弥漫、机器声嘈杂轰鸣，新的工程开始了！高空、地面、地下，到处是劳动着的人群：凿岩机的工人在向钢骨水泥的旧基础进攻；电焊工在钢铁的骨架上工作，一串串的火花迸散下来；背着安全带的架工，在令人心悸的高空中活动；握着捣固钎子的混凝土工，在捣固新的混凝土基础；电气工聚精会神地在给新的工程制造脉络和神经。被碾翻的柏油路上整天飞扬着灰土，各式载重汽车、起重机、万能装卸机、马拉的胶皮车、手推车，构成了一条活的运输带，从早到晚不停息地转动着。鞍山的工人阶级，在以极度紧张的劳动执行着国家的第一个五年计划。
    薄板厂工地的爆破队一进入工地就作了精彩的表演。三月份，他们的爆破任务是要炸掉三千立方公尺的旧基础；但是到二十日只完成了一千二百立方公尺。工人们深知完成计划对鞍山建设速度的意义。英勇的突击工作展开了。原来是两个人用一台凿岩机，现在变为一个人一台，半脱离生产的干部也都操起了机器。出色的凿岩工史俊伦，在这紧要关头，为了使机器向下钻得快些，索性骑上机器把子。钢骨水泥的基础比石头还难钻，机器在他的腿下像正在射击的机枪一样抖动。结果，他一个人一台机器，一天打眼五十公尺，接着又创出六十公尺的新纪录。在这样的突击下，他们十天中完成了百分之六十的任务，并且节省了百分之四十的人工。
    为了战胜时间，设计处的设计人员，用心改进工作方法、研究去年设计的教训，只两个半月便把七号高炉设计出来，比去年设计八号高炉时快了四个半月。这个设计不但快，而且大大减少了错误。
    今年三月，鞍山的工人阶级已向祖国献出了全国第一座自动化炼铁高炉；无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂正在紧张地安装机械，并进行部分的试车，尽力争取使这些高度自动化设备在今年开动起来，为国家生产钢材。新动工的七号高炉、薄板厂的改建工程，也将和前述三大工程媲美。七号高炉将建设成为目前中国最大的、自动化程度最高的一座高炉。明年，当春天再度降临鞍山的时候，薄板厂将用自动化的设备，制造出祖国急需的马口铁、瓦垄铁和各种薄铁板；七号高炉将按时流出铁水；大型钢材、无缝钢管也将源源地运往各地了。而在这些工程竣工之前，一九五三年的秋天，市郊又要出现二十万平方公尺的新住宅，两万五千个职工和他们的家属将在这里得到优美舒适的新居。
    面临着这些技术复杂、规模宏大的工程，鞍山的人们有着无比的信心。一年以前，现代化的建设技术对鞍山的工人是陌生的，但经过去年一年的实践，他们在苏联专家的指导下，已经开始在用世界上最先进的建设技术武装着自己的头脑和双手。当我们遍访各主要工地，问工人们能否在技术方面排除万难而飞速前进时，他们的回答是：“一定能够！”
    这种回答有着充分的根据，去年安装起来的五号鼓风机便是见证。这是一台新式的设备，高度的自动化使它像个有生命的动物，它可以适应高炉的需要自动调整转数、调整风压，它可以自动地上油，遇到危险情况也可以自动停车；因此，对安装技术的要求就非常严格。安装队的主要人物——队长夏树林，组长苏忠孝、丁成志、李承君，在钳工当中虽然都是好手，但他们一打开装设备的箱子却只能认识两个大件——“这是透平”，“那是鼓风”，别的就全叫不出名字来。面对着这个工程，大家都不知从何着手。但困难从没有挡住过鞍山的工人，他们虚心地向苏联专家请教，坚决地遵照苏联专家的技术指导去做，一次不成，再一次；结果，不但胜利地安上了鼓风机，而且创造了奇迹；设计要求的定心公差是零点零四粍，他们竟做到零点零零五粍；设计要求的震动系数在零点零二粍以下，这已是世界上第一流的技术标准，五号鼓风机以每分钟三千六百转以上的速度运转时，没有丝毫的震动！今年，这支安装队又在七号高炉工地执行新的任务——安装两台鼓风机，每一台都比去年的五号鼓风机大百分之五十。苏忠孝、丁成志两个小组已敢于各包一台，而李承君就把全部的回水系统包下来了。队里的技术工人并没有增加，大家却感到给的任务太少，还问：“为啥不干三台？”去年，预安装花费了七十天，今年他们决定只用三十天；去年是苏联专家一步一步地扶着他们，今年就可以看着他们自己走了。夏树林说：“去年一年学的，顶过去三十年学的，还都是头等技术！今年我们还敢保证这两台新鼓风机像五号鼓风机一样，没有震动！”
      周相臣和他的爆破队也是同样杰出的。去年，无缝钢管厂工地有一项复杂的工程叫作“托柱换基”——把支撑厂房梁架的钢柱往上顶起一百粍，把钢柱的混凝土基础拆掉重新浇灌。旧的钢柱基础只有用炸药爆破才能很快地清除，但在爆破时丝毫都不许使钢柱受到震动。某些不相信人能够控制炸药威力的人，就主张用人工来凿，但三个人忙累一天，凿下的混凝土比西瓜大不了多少；更笨拙的是，有人竟主张用卷扬机往外拖。这时候，周相臣出来了，他从苏联专家那里学来了爆破岩石、煤田、冻层的一些先进方法，他根据这些经验反复地琢磨，在各种各样的旧基础上试验，终于研究出来一个名叫“小龟裂”的爆破法，顺利地清除了无缝钢管厂的旧基础。今年，周相臣已是薄板厂工地的一个工段段长，原来在他的爆破队里的凿岩工张润波，当上这里的爆破队长了。虽然他们在执行新的任务当中又遇到了更麻烦的问题——厂房钢柱基础四周的旧混凝土都要炸掉，而又不许伤着和它们联接在一起的钢柱基础；但周相臣却说：“不要紧，我们又研究出来了新办法！有了去年的经验，现在就是五公尺以外有马达在转，我也敢在这里下炸药！”
    有名的机械化施工队，更是“从无到有、从小到大、从不懂到懂”的一个活例子。去年，这个队刚成立的时候，只有四个人，现在已经发展成为拥有五百多人的强大队伍了。去年二月，这里的司机们谁也没有看见过这些新式的施工机械，更不用说如意地制服这些机械，有时把起重机的臂扬起来就不知该怎样落下，想让它向右转，但一搬机柄，它却转到左边去了；现在，这些人已经可以自由地操纵着各种机械，驰骋在工地上，成为施工中不可缺少的“特种兵团”了。今年，这里又增加了新的机械——柴油打桩机、混凝土泵、电动起重机。设备到来不久，几个年青的技术员和老工人就已经会操纵它们了。
    这些并不是个别事例，在这里，我们的钳工、焊工、电工、混凝土工……，都掌握了不少的先进技术。去年的学徒工今年有许多已能单独进行工作，许多刚刚走出学校的男女大学生已经变成了施工中的技术管理干部。无缝钢管厂工地机械安装队的一些见习技术员们，在见习期满时每个人都写了
    一份长达两万五千字的见习报告，而且都是很有价值的技术专题报告；一位工程师告诉我们：过去的见习技术员见习期满的时候，顶多只能写出三、五页的报告来。
    看看鞍山工人阶级去年一年所走的这条道路，就
    可以了解他们的信心的由来了。在现代化的、大规模的建设当中，光凭热情是不够的，技术在当前更占有特别重要的地位。鞍山的工人阶级，在苏联专家的帮助下已经开始在掌握它！
    鞍山春天的面貌就是如此。如果说去年鞍山的建设还是大规模建设的序幕，那么今年鞍山的工人阶级又担负了比去年大一倍的任务，作为祖国第一个五年计划的执行者走在全国前面了。鞍山建设的成就使祖国人民感到兴奋、得到鼓舞。反过来，热情的鼓励和支援又来自全国，这种联系愈来愈加强了！
    人们常常喜欢用“春天”“曙光”象征充沛的生命和胜利的开始，鞍山的春天实际上已向全国人民显示了自己的身份，而且被全国人民所承认了！这就是说，鞍山的建设代表着祖国的青春和未来，鞍山的春天是属于祖国人民的。
