Central South, Southwest China and many regions of Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Suiyuan Provinces have generally held spring material exchange conferences to purchase farmers' local specialties and supply draft animals, seeds, and fertilizers to support spring plowing production. Because of clear goals, the emphasis of party and government organs, relatively sufficient preparations, and the implementation of the transaction policy of "advanced out, cash on delivery, retail sales as the main focus," great achievements have been made. For example, at a material exchange conference in Shouchang County, Zhejiang, farmers sold more than 100 million yuan worth of local products such as tobacco leaves, preserved meat, and handmade paper, and bought back 25,000 pieces of iron, wood, and bamboo farm tools. At the material exchange conferences in Sanyuan, Chaoyi, Huanglong, Yijun, and Fengxian counties in Shaanxi Province, more than 57,000 pieces of farm tools and more than 2,490 head of livestock were supplied, greatly improving the situation of severe shortage of draft animals and farm tools in the local area.

Another achievement of the material exchange conferences is that they have found sales channels for many unsalable local specialties and handicrafts. At the material exchange conference in southern Hunan, more than 20,000 live pigs were sold through futures contracts from April to the early rice harvest, which is equivalent to exchanging 150,000 dan of rice or 300,000 dan of ferrous sulfate (fertilizer) for farmers, which played a significant role in overcoming the spring famine and solving production difficulties. At the material exchange conference in Baotou City, the stove industry signed 870 million yuan of farm tool processing contracts with farmers in various places, solving the sales problem for half a year's products. At the Beijing Spring Material Exchange Conference, more than 70 kinds of commodities produced by more than 20 industries in the city were sold, including rubber shoes, new drugs, paper, scissors, small knives, thimbles, abacuses, straw hats, socks, towels, and cultural and educational supplies. The wood industry and the vehicle industry purchased 1.1 billion yuan of timber, solving the raw material supply problem, which helped them overcome the off-season and strengthen the planning of production.

Due to the exchange of industrial and agricultural products and the solution of raw material and sales problems, the enthusiasm of private industrialists and businessmen has been encouraged, enabling them to correctly understand the rising purchasing power of urban and rural people, change their negative attitudes, and actively engage in supply and marketing activities. The proportion of transactions by private industrialists and businessmen in the total transaction volume in various places is generally above 50%, and in individual provinces it has even reached 80% to 90%. Farmers and industrialists and businessmen are very enthusiastic about participating in material exchange conferences. In the 25 material exchange conferences in Zhejiang, more than 900,000 farmers attended; according to the statistics of 10 material exchange conferences in Shaanxi, 1 million farmers participated; and at the material exchange conference in Ya'an City, Xikang Province, private industrialists and businessmen from as far away as Tianjin and Hankou went to participate.

However, some problems and deviations have also occurred in a few counties and towns in individual provinces. In Dacheng County, Hebei, and Neijiang and Baimiao in Sichuan, drought resistance work was relaxed, and the work of supplying production materials was neglected, and the material exchange conferences were turned into recreational events. At the material exchange conference in Fotang Town, Yiwu, Zhejiang, fireworks were set off and dragon lanterns were played, and farmers within a 30-mile radius came to watch the fun. The farmers said, "We would rather not eat than not watch the fireworks," which wasted manpower and money and seriously affected spring plowing production. Party and government organs in individual regions of the Northwest, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangxi still have the idea of "emphasizing production and neglecting exchange." They are afraid that "organizing exchanges will hinder production," and believe that "popular goods will naturally have sales channels, and stagnant goods will not be successful even if a conference is held," so they completely push the exchange conference to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce or the Federation of Industry and Commerce. As a result, there are insufficient preparations, insufficient publicity, no source of goods, and no connection between state-owned and private, finance and trade, and industry and handicrafts. Private merchants take the opportunity to cheat, raise prices and kill prices, and use large measures to deceive farmers, so farmers cannot sell their local products, and cannot buy the farm tools and fertilizers they want. In addition, some state-owned trade and cooperative cadres in certain regions unilaterally emphasize economic accounting, only fear backlogs, dare not boldly purchase goods, and give up the acquisition and supply of goods in the market, which affects the development of material exchange work, and this must also be corrected.

    中南、西南等很多地区举行春季物资交流会
    收购农副产品供应生产资料配合农业生产
    中南、西南区及浙江、陕西、绥远等省许多地区，普遍举行了春季物资交流大会，收购农民的土特产品，供应耕畜、种籽和肥料，以支援春耕生产。由于目标明确、党政机关重视、准备比较充分，又贯彻了“先进后出、现款现货、零售为主”的交易方针，所以取得了很大成绩。如浙江寿昌县一个物资交流会上，农民卖出的烟叶、腌腊、土纸等土产品就达一亿余元，买回铁、木、竹制的农具二万五千件。陕西省三原、朝邑、黄龙、宜君、凤县等县的物资交流大会上，共供应农具五万七千多件，牲畜二千四百九十多头，大大改善了当地严重缺乏耕畜农具的现象。
    物资交流大会的另一成绩是给很多滞销的土特产和手工业品找到了销路。湘南地区物资交流大会上通过期货合同卖出的生猪，从四月到早稻上市前即达两万多口，这等于给农民换进了稻谷十五万担，或青矾（肥料）三十万担，对于渡过春荒，解决生产困难起了很大作用。在包头市物资交流大会上，烘炉业和各地农民签定了八亿七千万元的农具加工合同，解决了半年的产品销路问题。北京市春季物资交流大会上销出了全市二十多个行业生产的胶鞋、新药、纸张以及剪刀、小刀、顶针、算盘、草帽、袜子、毛巾和文教用品等七十多种商品，木器业和车具业购进了十一亿元的木材，解决了原料供应问题，这就帮助它们渡过淡季并加强了生产的计划性。
    由于工农产品的交换和原料、销路问题的解决，又鼓舞了私营工商业者经营的积极性，使他们正确认识了城乡人民购买力上升的情况，改变了消极态度，积极从事供销活动。各地成交总额中私营工商业者成交的比重一般都在百分之五十以上，个别省份更达到了百分之八十至九十。农民和工商业者参加物资交流会的十分踊跃。浙江二十五个物资交流会中，到会农民九十多万人；据陕西十个县物资交流会的统计，参加的农民有一百万人，西康省雅安市的物资交流会，远至天津、汉口的私营工商业者都跑去参加。
    但在个别省份的少数县、镇，也发生了一些问题和偏向。河北大城县、四川内江、白马庙等地，放松抗旱工作，忽视供应生产资料工作，把物资交流大会开成了文娱大会。浙江义乌佛堂镇物资交流大会上，放焰火、玩龙灯，周围三十里地的农民都跑来看热闹。农民们说：“宁可不吃饭，焰火不可不看”，劳民伤财，严重影响了春耕生产。西北区、浙江、湖南、广西等地个别地区的党政机关仍存在“重生产、轻交流”思想。它们怕“组织交流，防碍生产”，认为“俏货自然有销路，滞货开会也不成”，把交流会完全推给工商局或工商联去搞，结果便发生准备不足，宣传不深入，没有货源，及国营和私营，金融和贸易，工业和手工业互不联系，私商乘机捣鬼、抬价杀价、大斗小秤剥夺农民，农民的土特产卖不出，想买的农具、肥料又买不到等现象。此外，某些地区国营贸易和合作社干部，片面强调经济核算，只怕积压，不敢大胆进货，放弃了对于市场货物的收购和供应，影响了物资交流工作的开展，这也必须改正。（郑重）
