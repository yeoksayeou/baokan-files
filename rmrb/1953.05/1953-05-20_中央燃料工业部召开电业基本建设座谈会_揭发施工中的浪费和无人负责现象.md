The Ministry of Fuel Industry Holds Symposium on Capital Construction in the Electricity Industry
    Exposing Waste and Lack of Accountability in Construction
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry held a symposium on capital construction in the electricity industry to study how to launch a struggle against waste and lack of accountability in electricity industry capital construction. Vice Minister Liu Lanbo presided over the symposium. Participants included the directors of the Capital Construction Department, Planning Department, and Management Department, the director of the Electricity Industry Management Bureau, and responsible comrades from inspection teams sent to Central South, East China, and other regions.
    According to the reports from the inspection teams, waste and lack of accountability are common and serious problems in electricity industry capital construction. First, the quality of the projects is poor. The foundation for the generator in Daye was poured at the end of January this year and the mold was removed in mid-February. After the mold was removed, it was discovered that the foundation was covered with pitted surfaces and honeycombing, with some honeycombs reaching a depth of 450 millimeters. The concrete was not properly poured during construction, and some beam and column joints had only sand and no cement, so they had to be torn down and redone. Due to design errors, the amount of rebar in this foundation was also insufficient. At the same time, the concrete was soft, and the foundation bolts could not be fixed. According to the advice of experts, a method of adding walls between the columns was adopted to remedy the situation, which delayed the construction period by three months. Six of the sixteen columns in the coal bunker of the new Zhengzhou Power Plant had to be torn down and rebuilt because the concrete quality was poor. A guest house was built at another new power plant last winter. The concrete quality of the second-floor balcony of the guest house was poor, and it collapsed when five people went up, causing them to fall.
    Second, construction periods are delayed. The Zhengzhou Power Plant construction site only completed 75 percent of its planned tasks in the first quarter. Soviet experts pointed out in early March that the steel for the main plant roof frame should be tested, but because too few samples were taken, the tests had to be redone. The turbine foundation was originally scheduled to be poured on March 18, but the construction period was delayed by 13 days because no one was responsible for testing the cement samples. Many projects, such as the coal transportation system, the combined installation of boiler water-cooled walls, and the bricklaying of plant buildings, could not be completed on schedule due to insufficient labor or other reasons.
    Third, there is waste in the storage and use of materials. For example, at the Zhengzhou construction site, there was no plan for the storage and use of materials, and large materials were often used for small purposes. Many large poles were sawn into firewood. A construction site in Hunan had already purchased boiler tubes last year, but no one was responsible, and another batch was purchased this year.
    Technical safety issues at the construction site have also not received attention. During the construction of the Ningchang Line, more than fifty workers were slightly or seriously injured while carrying cement poles. A demobilized cadre in charge of this work even said, "How many people die in a battle? What are a few dozen minor and serious injuries!"
    Vice Minister Liu Lanbo and Director Cheng Mingsheng analyzed the reasons for the above-mentioned waste and unanimously pointed out that there are many reasons for the waste in construction, such as the late determination of plans, urgent task requirements, lack of experience of cadres, and low technical level, but the most important reason is the serious lack of accountability in construction management, unsound organizational systems, and lack of planning in work. First of all, there is no responsibility system between Party A and Party B. Many construction sites in the Xiangzhong Electricity System, the Zhengzhou 363 construction site, and the North China Electricity System had not signed formal construction contracts between Party A and Party B before this inspection, but instead adopted a method of entrusting agency. Sometimes, even if some agreements were signed, everyone did not implement them seriously. Even many construction sites of Party A did not know what their responsibilities were. The phenomenon of lack of unified leadership and lack of accountability on the construction site is also common. A project is entrusted to several units separately, and there are "multiple heads," often causing disconnection and confusion. According to the inspection of the Zhengzhou Power Plant construction site by the Central South inspection team, on this construction site, no one was responsible for organizing the implementation and inspection of the implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts; technical personnel and some old workers were ideologically conservative and unwilling to implement them, and no one cared; there was no quality responsibility system or technical responsibility system on the site, and accidents occurred repeatedly without attracting attention; even the personnel department did not know how many people were working on the site every day, and when paying wages, it was impossible to determine the accurate number of attendance, so they had to post a notice asking everyone to come and collect their wages. In addition, the storage of equipment on the construction site was chaotic. The equipment was placed on the ground unattended. The head of the equipment department said: "We are only responsible for the gross weight and net weight of the equipment, and for knowing whether the boxes are damaged. As for which equipment has arrived and where it should be placed, that is the business of the production and technology department." The production and technology department believes that they are not responsible for the equipment. No one is responsible for technical safety on the construction site: a worker was working downstairs and was knocked unconscious by a piece of steel falling from upstairs; workers need to wear safety belts when working at heights, but the safety belts purchased were made of paper. The financial system of the construction site is also very unsound. The expenditures for February were not recorded until April. The construction site has no financial cost plan. When spending money, they ask the finance department for it, and when they are finished, they are reimbursed. There is no cost accounting and no plan for the use of funds. Therefore, everyone only knows that there is a lot of waste on the construction site, but they do not know how much waste there is.
    Based on the above situation, Vice Minister Liu Lanbo pointed out that the electricity industry capital construction system must vigorously oppose waste and expose the phenomenon of lack of accountability in the second quarter, and establish and improve various responsibility systems. He also pointed out the specific steps for opposing the phenomenon of lack of accountability and establishing a responsibility system, and required the leading cadres of each construction site to conduct a thorough inspection and summary of the work in the first quarter in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy. Those who have already established a responsibility system should check whether the responsibility system is sound and how it is being implemented, and then mobilize the masses to expose a large amount of waste and lack of accountability in the construction and put forward rationalization proposals to change this situation. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, establish and improve the responsibility system. Vice Minister Liu Lanbo also instructed the Electricity Industry Management Bureau to immediately use the materials that have been exposed to educate the workers and masses, and required each construction site to start the struggle against lack of accountability and the establishment of a responsibility system from May.

### 中央燃料工业部召开电业基本建设座谈会  揭发施工中的浪费和无人负责现象

    中央燃料工业部召开电业基本建设座谈会
    揭发施工中的浪费和无人负责现象
    中央燃料工业部举行了电业基本建设座谈会，研究在电业基本建设中如何开展反对浪费和无人负责现象的斗争。座谈会由刘澜波副部长主持。参加座谈的有基本建设司、计划司、经理司等司长，电业管理总局局长以及派赴中南、华东等地的检查组的负责同志。
    据检查组汇报：在电业基本建设中浪费和无人负责现象是普遍而严重的。首先是工程质量低劣。大冶发电机基座工程今年一月末浇制完毕，二月中旬拆模，拆模后发现基座上到处都是麻面蜂窝，有的蜂窝深达四百五十公厘，施工中混凝土浇捣不良，有的梁柱接合部分只有砂子而无浆，结果只好打掉重做；有的柱子上有五十公分和六十公分深洞，等于把柱子切成两半，也必须打掉重浇。因为设计错误，这个基座的铁筋数量也不够。同时，混凝土松软，地脚螺丝无法固定，只好根据专家建议，采取在柱间加墙的办法来补救，从而延误工期三个月。郑州新建发电厂煤仓间的十六根柱子有六根因混凝土质量不好，必须打掉重做。另一新建发电厂去年冬天建筑了一个招待所。招待所二楼阳台混凝土质量不好，上去了五个人就把它压垮了，人也跌了下来。
    其次是延误工期。郑州电厂工地第一季只完成计划任务的百分之七十五。苏联专家三月初就指出，主厂房屋架的钢料要进行化验，结果却因为取样过少，不得不重做化验。透平机基础原计划三月十八日灌浇，因为水泥样无专人负责化验，结果延误工期十三天。运煤系统、组合安装锅炉冷水壁、厂房砌砖等工程因劳动力不够或其他原因而不能按期完工的也很多。
    再次是器材储备和使用方面的浪费现象。如郑州工地保管材料使用材料都无计划，常常大材小用，许多很大的杆子被锯成劈柴了。湖南有个工地去年已经买了锅炉管，但是没人负责，今年又买来一批。
    施工现场的技术保安问题也大都没有引起注意。宁常线线路工程施工中，民工搬运洋灰杆轻重伤五十多人。负责这一工作的一位转业干部还说：“打一仗要死多少人哪，几十个轻重伤算什么！”
    刘澜波副部长和程明陞局长分析上述浪费现象发生的原因时一致指出：造成施工浪费的原因很多，比如，计划确定较迟，任务要求很急，干部没有经验，技术水平不高等，但最主要的还是在施工管理中存在着严重的无人负责现象，机构制度不健全，工作没有计划。首先在甲乙双方之间没有责任制度。湘中电业系统、郑州三六三工地以及华北电业系统的许多工地，在这次检查之前，甲、乙双方都没有签订正式的施工合同，而是采用委托代办方法。有时虽然签订了一些协议，大家也不认真执行。甚至许多工地的甲方不知道自己的责任是什么。施工现场缺乏统一领导和无人负责的现象也是普遍的。一个工程分别委托给几个单位，现场上“多头多脑”，时常发生脱节混乱现象。根据中南检查组对郑州电厂工地的检查，在这个工地上，对苏联专家的建议无人负责组织执行和检查执行；技术人员和有些老工人思想保守不肯执行也没人管；现场上没有质量责任制和技术责任制，屡次发生事故也没有引起注意；甚至现场上每天有多少人工作，人事科不知道，发工资时弄不清准确出勤人数，只好贴布告让大家去领。此外，工地设备保管混乱。设备放在地上无人看管，设备科长说：“我们保管设备是只管毛重净重，掌握箱子坏不坏，至于哪些设备到了，该放在什么地方，那是生产技术科的事。”而生产技术科认为他们对设备不负任何责任。工地技术保安也无人负责：有一个工人在楼下作业，被楼上掉下一段钢筋打破了头而昏倒在地，经过好久才被人发现；进行高空作业工人需要系安全带，但是买来的安全带却是纸做的。工地的财务制度也很不健全，二月份的开支到四月份才记账。工地没有财务成本计划，花钱时就向财务科要，花完了就报销，没有成本计算也没有用款计划。所以，大家只知道工地浪费很大，却不知道究竟浪费了多少。
    根据上述情况，刘澜波副部长指出，电业基本建设系统在第二季度中必须大力反对浪费，揭发无人负责现象，建立和健全各种责任制度。并指出反对无人负责现象和建立责任制度的具体步骤，要求各工地领导干部结合反官僚主义斗争，对第一季工作进行一次深入的检查总结，已经建立过责任制的，应该检查责任制是否健全，执行情况如何，而后发动群众大量揭发施工中的浪费和无人负责现象，提出改变这种情况的合理化建议，在发动群众的基础上建立与健全责任制度。刘澜波副部长并责成电业管理总局立即用已经揭发的材料教育职工群众，并要求各工地从五月起一定要开始进行反对无人负责和建立责任制的斗争。
