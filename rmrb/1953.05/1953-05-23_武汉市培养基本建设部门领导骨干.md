    中共武汉市委员会企业部和建筑工程委员会已联合举办了基本建设知识学习会。参加这个学习会的学员近一百五十人，其中大部分是武汉市各工地、工程公司的共产党组织、行政、工会和青年团组织的负责干部。他们都是先后由农村、部队以及其他不同岗位上调来参加基本建设工作的。举办学习会的目的，就是通过建筑工程方面的基本知识和“基本建设工作暂行办法”等课程的学习，使他们了解有关基本建设方面的知识，尽快地熟悉业务。现在，这个学习会已正式开学，正根据教学计划进行系统的学习。
    武汉市总工会干部学校也已开始举办建筑工人积极分子训练班。训练班计划分四期举行，每期暂定一个半月，要求通过以“共产主义与共产党”为主的政治学习和适当的工会业务学习后，达到培养工会基层干部，充实工会基层组织的目的；同时也为基本建设部门输送党组织和行政干部创造条件。训练班第一期已在五月六日开学，学员有武汉市工程公司、湖北省工程公司、中南工程公司、武汉市修建公司、武汉砖瓦公司等单位的积极分子二百五十人。
