Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th: TASS reports: This week, numerous trade unions and other organizations in Britain held their annual conferences across the country. In these meetings, it was expressed in various forms that the vast majority of the British people ardently desire peace and the establishment of friendly relations between major powers in the East and West.

    At the Co-operative Congress held in Llandudno, North Wales, the chairman, John Kliner, said in his opening address: "It is entirely possible to unite the countries of the world in some kind of development cooperation plan." This statement received enthusiastic applause from the representatives of the 11 million participants in the cooperative movement. Kliner condemned the arms race, saying that the problem of our time is how to make the East and West cooperate and coexist.
    The Co-operative Congress warmly welcomed Timofeyev, a guest from the Soviet Union, who brought fraternal greetings from the Soviet cooperative movement.
    The Foundry Workers' Union, with 81,000 members, held its annual conference in Scarborough, Yorkshire. The conference chairman, A. McDougall, said in his opening address: "We must insist that British soldiers return home and demand the removal of all obstacles to achieving peace on the devastated land of Korea. In Britain, our goal should be to make Britain completely independent so that we can handle all our own political and economic affairs with the self-respect befitting a free people." The meeting criticized the obstructive tactics adopted by the American representatives in the Panmunjom negotiations and demanded the immediate admission of People's China to the United Nations.
    The meeting passed a resolution condemning the arming of West Germany and urging the British government to send foreign troops stationed in Britain back home, as these foreign troops are a threat to British independence.
    The annual conference of the Woodworkers' Union, representing 200,000 members, held in Blackpool (Lancashire), passed a resolution emphasizing that the actions of the United States have far exceeded the purpose declared by the United Nations in Korea and are in danger of leading to a third world war. The resolution demanded the admission of People's China to the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th: TASS reports:
    The "Daily Worker" reports: In Airdrie, Scotland, 1,200 people have signed an appeal initiated by a local group of the National Women's Assembly, demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities in Korea and negotiations with the Soviet Union to resolve world problems. The appeal has been sent to Prime Minister Churchill.
    An appeal signed by 400 workers at the Tiel Steel Factory in Scotland made the same demands. This appeal has been given to Labour MP Alexander Anderson.
    Labour MP J. Timmons from the Bothwell district of Scotland received a similar appeal.
    The "Daily Worker" reported that in a poll organized by the Woodford Peace Committee in Essex, every participant voted in favor of an immediate ceasefire in Korea. Churchill is the Member of Parliament for the Woodford constituency, and the results of this poll have been sent to him.
    In a similar poll held in East Ham, London, 97 percent of participants voted in favor of an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 29th: TASS reports: Peace committees in factories and residential areas of the Bouches-du-Rhône department organized mass demonstrations and rallies. The slogan of the rallies was: "Take united action to win the victory of peace negotiations."
    In the past few days, 1,800 Marseille tram workers signed an appeal calling for peace in Vietnam.
    The French Veterans Association held a congress in Avignon, unanimously passing a resolution calling for steps to ease international tensions. The congress also expressed opposition to the rearmament of West Germany and demanded an end to the Vietnam War.
    Veterans and war victims in the Vosges department held a meeting to protest against the remilitarization of West Germany and demand peace in Korea and Indochina.
