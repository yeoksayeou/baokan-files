    Karl Marx Memorial Exhibition Held at the Museum of German Democratic Republic History
    Editor's Note: After the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany announced 1953 as the Karl Marx Memorial Year, a Karl Marx Memorial Exhibition was held in Berlin in early March. We are now translating and publishing the "Neues Deutschland" introduction to this exhibition below.
      The highlight of the 1953 Karl Marx Memorial Year is the Karl Marx Memorial Exhibition at the German History Museum, which opened in Berlin in early March, a few days before the 70th anniversary of Marx's death.
    The exhibition occupies 2,200 square meters in the former armory on "Unter den Linden," which will become the German History Museum, and can be said to be the largest introduction to Marx's life and works to date.
    Under the leadership of Professor Moslitz, the staff of the German History Museum accepted this great and glorious patriotic task to honor the greatest son of the German people in accordance with the significance of Karl Marx's personality to the German people and the history of all mankind.
      Preparations for the exhibition began in the summer of last year. The museum received strong support from the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute of Berlin and the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party in its work.
      Because it cannot be limited to merely narrating Marx's life, it is necessary to collect
    more than one hundred years of data. Engels' career is inseparable from his, so the first part of the exhibition is from Marx's birth to Engels' death, that is, from 1818 to 1895.
      However, an exhibition that only introduces the life of the founder of Marxism is not enough to illustrate the necessity of the continuous development of Marx's doctrine, especially its world-transforming power. Therefore, the second part of the exhibition shows Lenin and Stalin's theoretical works on the continued development of Marxism-Engelsism, and the realization of socialist thought beginning with the Great Socialist October Revolution of 1917.
    The third part is the irresistible victorious advance of Marxism-Leninism after the Second World War. Today, the whole world is studying this doctrine, and under the leadership of the Soviet Union, a camp of peace, democracy, and socialism including 800 million people has been formed. In this section, the development of Germany, the country where Marx was born, since 1945 occupies a large place. In particular, it shows how Democratic Germany is fulfilling Marx's legacy.
    The first part of the exhibition details Marx and Engels' research achievements on the new world outlook, dialectical and historical materialism, discovered the laws of development of capitalist society, and scientifically proved that capitalism will be replaced by socialism. A miniature relief of the Rhine region in 1830, models of factories and machines, give us an impression of a Germany that is just beginning to industrialize, making us realize that the great genius of the founders of scientific socialism lies in the fact that he already saw the creators of a new social order without exploitation and oppression in the newly emerging working class. In Marx and Engels' early works "The Holy Family," "The Poverty of Philosophy," etc., we can trace how they gave the growing class consciousness of the proletariat a theoretical basis and proclaimed the proletariat's mission to world history. But they also established a leading organization for the struggle of the working class, namely the "Communist League" established in 1847.
    The next section is the role played by Marx and Engels during the struggle for a unified and democratic Germany in 1848-49. On the eve of this revolution, at the end of February 1848, the "Communist Manifesto" was published, whereby Marx and Engels gave the world's working class a program of struggle, which can truly be called the birth certificate of scientific socialism. In the exhibition books, we see Marx in the editorial department of the "Neue Rheinische Zeitung," the organ of the left wing of the democrats he established, and we see him giving a speech on "Wage Labor and Capital" to the Vienna workers' conference. Another picture shows us Engels fighting in the Baden Freikorps against the Prussian reactionary army.
    The exhibition emphasizes how Marxism developed in the struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, and how it consolidated in the struggle against social democracy. What shows us this struggle is mainly the section on Marx's establishment of the "First International" from 1864 to 1872. On the one hand, the founding declaration represents
    a brilliant example of how Marx knew how to bring various
    different factions of the workers' movement, lead to common action. On the other hand, he insisted on a relentless struggle against the Bakuninists and Proudhonists. Finally, the dominant rule of Marxism realized in the workers' movement had to oppose Lassalleanism, because it attempted to divert the working class from the revolutionary path with opportunistic "theories." The most valuable document against the first major form of social democracy is Marx's "Critique of the Gotha Program," written in 1875, which is also an important weapon in our struggle today.
    In order to explain to visitors this arduous task of the theoretical issues in Marx and Engels' works. Special efforts were made. In "Capital," we find an indication of its world-historical significance, pointing out the inevitable demise of capitalist society and the victory of the proletariat. In Lenin's words: "The theory of surplus value is the main cornerstone of Marx's economic theory." This points out the main points of "Capital."
    Each chapter of the book is indicated. For example, the book shows the original accumulation of capital and the distress of peasants and bloody legislation, showing the exploitation of workers, the consequences of economic crises, the destruction of products and means of production, etc. We can also follow the various stages of class struggle: machine storm, petition movement, strikes, armed uprisings, etc. Finally, we see how the Russian workers, through the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, successfully implemented the struggle to eliminate capitalist exploitation and oppression.
      Several charts illustrate the problems in the development of Marxism-Leninism. For example, a chart is about the doctrine of the Party, citing the basic ideas included in the works of Marx and Engels. Then it explains the continuation of this principle by Lenin and Stalin, the composition of the new type of party. Similar charts are on the issues of the state, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the peasant question, all showing the unity of Marxism-Leninism.
    Another section shows us Marx's relationship with Russia. In order to study the situation of this great eastern neighbor of Germany directly from Russian materials, he learned Russian. Russian books with Marx's handwritten annotations are particularly noteworthy. In letters, he provided tactics and instructions to Russian revolutionaries. The fact that Marx himself presided over the Russian Department of the First International proves how much he valued the Russian revolutionary movement.
    The German History Museum has succeeded in extensively collecting original documents. The main works of Marx and Engels all have first editions. There is also a "Capital" with Bebel's inscription. Many pictures give us an impression of Marx's personal life. What is of particular interest to visitors to the exhibition is Marx's studio, which is displayed according to its original size and form.
    In this way, the exhibition introduces a deeply impressive picture of the life and struggle of the greatest son of our country. It will greatly help to understand the most important cultural heritage of our nation, Marxism, and the broadest unity of our working people and intellectuals. So that the struggle for a unified and independent Germany, and the struggle to create a socialist foundation in the German Democratic Republic, can be carried out with more confidence in victory. The exhibition will help to realize Marx's immortal saying: "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."

### 德意志民主共和国历史博物院举办的卡尔·马克思纪念展览会

    德意志民主共和国历史博物院举办的卡尔·马克思纪念展览会
    编者按：在德国统一社会党中央委员会宣布一九五三年为卡尔·马克思纪念年之后，今年三月初柏林举行了卡尔·马克思纪念展览会。现在我们把“新德意志报”关于这个展览会的介绍译载在下面。
      一九五三年卡尔·马克思纪念年的顶点是德国历史博物院的卡尔·马克思纪念展览会，它于三月初马克思逝世七十周年纪念日前几天在柏林开幕。
    展览会是在“菩提树下”从前的兵器陈列馆，将来的德国历史博物院里，占地二千二百平方公尺，可以说是迄今关于马克思生平及著述最大的一次介绍。
    德国历史博物院的工作人员在莫思立教授领导之下，接受这个伟大光荣的爱国任务，按照卡尔·马克思人格上对于德国人民及全部世界人类历史的意义，来崇敬这德国人民最伟大的儿子。
      展览会的准备工作从去年夏季已经着手。博物院在工作上获得柏林马、恩、列学院及统一社会党中央委员会有力的支持。
      因为不能限于仅只叙述马克思的一生，需要搜集
    一百余年的资料。恩格斯的事业又是和他不可分的，所以展览会的第一段是从马克思降生到恩格斯逝世为止，就是从一八一八年到一八九五年。
      但是一个展览会仅只介绍了马克思主义创始人的生平，并不足以说明马克思学说所具有的不断继续发展的必要性，尤其是它那改变世界的力量。所以展览会的第二段是显示列宁、斯大林关于继续发展马恩学说的理论著作，以及由一九一七年伟大社会主义十月革命开始的社会主义思想的实现。
    第三段是第二次世界大战后，马克思列宁主义所向无阻胜利进军的情况。今天全世界都学习这个学说，并且在苏联领导之下组成了包括八亿人口的和平、民主、社会主义阵营。在这一段里，德国，马克思降生的国家，一九四五年以来的发展占很大的地位。特别是表示出民主德国怎样履行马克思的遗训。
    展览会的第一段详细表明马克思和恩格斯关于新世界观，辩证的历史唯物主义的研究成就，发现了资本主义社会的发展规律，并且科学地证明资本主义将为社会主义所替代。一八三零年莱茵区的缩影浮雕，工厂和机器的模型，给我们一个刚开始工业化的德国的印象，使我们认识到科学的社会主义创立者的伟大天才，在于他从刚发生的工人阶级里，已经看到新的，没有剥削压迫的社会秩序的创造人。在马克思和恩格斯的早期著作“神圣的家族”、“哲学底贫困”等中，我们可以追寻，他们怎样地给无产阶级日渐增长的阶级意识以理论的基础，并且宣扬无产阶级对于世界历史的使命。但是他们也给工人阶级建立了斗争的领导机构，就是一八四七年成立的“共产主义者同盟”。
    次一段是马克思和恩格斯在一八四八至四九年间，当为统一民主的德国革命斗争的时候，所发生的作用。在这次革命的前夕，一八四八年二月底，“共产党宣言”出版，由此马克思和恩格斯给了全世界工人阶级以斗争纲领，确可以称之为科学的社会主义的出生证。在展览的图书上我们看到马克思在他所设立的民主派左翼的言论机关“新莱茵报”的编辑部里，看到他对维也纳工人讲演“雇佣劳动与资本”的大会。另一张画幅上指示给我们的是恩格斯在巴登费里齐民军中和普鲁士反动派的军队战斗。
    在展览会里着重说明，马克思主义怎样在反对资产阶级的和小资产阶级的思想意识斗争中发展，怎样在反对社会民主主义斗争中巩固。指示给我们这种斗争的，主要是关于一八六四至一八七二年马克
    思建立“第一国际”的一段。一方面那创立宣言表示
    一个光辉的实例，马克思知道怎样把工人运动各种
    不同的流派，引导于共同的行动。另一方面他坚持反对巴枯宁主义者和蒲鲁东主义者的无情斗争。最后在工人运动中实现了的马克思主义的优势统治又不得不反对拉萨尔主义，因为它企图以机会主义的 “理论”把工人阶级引开革命的道路。反对社会民主主义第一次主要形态最有价值的文件是一八七五年马克思所写的“哥达纲领批判”，在我们今天的斗争上也是一个重要的武器。
    为了向参观者说明马克思和恩格斯著作上理论问题的这一艰巨任务。尽了特别的努力，在“资本论”上我们找到它那世界历史意义的一个指示，指出资本主义社会的灭亡及无产阶级胜利必不可免的事实。用列宁的话来说：“剩余价值论是马克思经济理论底主要基石”。这就给我们指出了“资本论”的主要论点。
    全书各个章节都加以表明。例如用图书表明原始的资本累积及农民的困苦以及血腥的立法，表明对工人的剥削，经济危机的作用结果，生产品及生产手段的毁灭等。我们也可以跟踪阶级斗争的各个不同时期：机器风潮，请愿运动，罢工，武装起义等。最后我们看到怎样由俄国工人通过建立无产阶级专政，实行了消灭资本主义的剥削和压迫大获成功的斗争。
      若干图表上阐明马克思列宁主义发展中的问题。例如一张图表是关于党的学说，引述马克思和恩格斯著作里所包括的基本思想。接着说明由列宁和斯大林继续发展这个原则，新型党的组成。类似的另几张图表上是国家问题，无产阶级专政问题，农民问题，都表明马克思主义列宁主义的统一性。
    其他一段指示给我们马克思与俄国的关系。他为了直接从俄文资料里研究这个德国东方伟大邻邦的情形，学了俄文。马克思亲笔批注的俄文书籍特别引人注意。在信件里他对于俄国革命党人提供了策略和指示。马克思在第一国际自己主持俄国部这一事实，可以证明他对于俄国革命运动如何重视。
    德国历史博物院做到了广泛地搜集原本文件。马克思和恩格斯的主要著作都有初版的版本。还有一本“资本论”带着倍倍尔的题字。许多图片使我们对于马克思的个人生活获得印象。特别使展览会参观者发生兴趣的是那按照原来大小形式陈列起来的马克思的工作室。
    展览会就这样介绍了我们国家最伟大儿子的生平和斗争的印象极深的情况。它对于认识我们民族最重要的文化遗产，马克思主义，我们劳动人民和知识分子最广泛的团结，将有很大的帮助。使其为统一独立德国的斗争，为在德意志民主共和国内创造社会主义基础的斗争，更能满怀胜利信心地进行。展览会将有助于实现马克思不朽的名言：“哲学家们曾经只是用不同的方式说明世界，但是现在问题是在于改变世界。”
