    The "Industrial Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic" opened in Beijing on April 27th. The book "The German Democratic Republic in Reconstruction" can help everyone gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the GDR.
    The book is divided into seven chapters, mainly introducing the territory, natural conditions and minerals, industry, agriculture and forestry, transportation, trade, population, and the construction goals to be achieved by the completion of the Five-Year Plan in 1955.
    The territory of the German Democratic Republic is 108,000 square kilometers, and the population is approximately 20 million. "In terms of administrative regions, the German Democratic Republic is divided into states, districts, and municipalities." (Page 75) The country is composed of five states. These five states are: Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Saxony. "The democratic area of ​​the German capital, Greater Berlin, is also under the administration of the German Democratic Republic, but does not belong to the German Democratic Republic." (Page 17)
    Hitler's rule and World War II left the German people with profound disasters. Vast cities and villages were destroyed, and tens of thousands of people were wandering around, homeless. The task of reconstruction was very arduous and urgent. Therefore, the people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and with the support of the Soviet government, implemented necessary democratic reforms. This made "the entire social life become democratic, all warmongers and war criminals were punished, fascists and reactionaries were cleared from public life, the properties of large landowners and monopoly capitalists were confiscated and distributed to the people, democratic land reform was also completed, and extensive school reforms broke the educational monopoly of the propertied class" (Page 7), paving the way for reconstruction.
    The economy of the German Democratic Republic was initially established through the hard work of the working people. In the summer of 1948, it entered a planned economy—implementing a two-year plan. The two-year plan "was completed in only eighteen months. On August 1, 1950, production reached 86 percent of the pre-war 1936 level." (Page 11) This was followed by the Five-Year Plan from 1950 to 1955. The Five-Year Plan "stipulates greatly expanding industrial and agricultural production, significantly increasing transportation capacity, and restoring domestic and foreign trade. In 1955, the total industrial production value will reach 43.8 billion German marks, while in 1950 it was 23 billion German marks. ... Therefore, in the mining industry, the plan is to increase production by 94 percent by 1955. Steel production ... will increase by 137 percent. ... The manufacture of heavy machinery ... is planned to increase by 121 percent. ... The output of building materials industry will ... increase by 80 percent. ... By 1955, the total value of consumer goods production in the textile and light industries will ... increase by 90 percent. ... By 1955, the transport tonnage will increase by 60 percent compared to 1950." (Pages 33-34) The Five-Year Plan will greatly improve the people's living standards. "During the Five-Year Plan, wages will increase by an average of 17 percent, prices will decrease by 28 percent, and taxes will also decrease. Food rationing will be completely abolished. In some aspects, the average consumption of food will reach a higher level compared to 1936." (Page 34)
    Coal and iron are the most important raw materials for modern industry, and in the German Democratic Republic, both of these raw materials have considerable reserves. Coal production is mostly in the states of Saxony and Brandenburg. Pig iron production is in Thuringia. In addition to the above two minerals, the German Democratic Republic also has deposits of uranium, copper, zinc, magnesium salt, gypsum, and lime.
    "The German Democratic Republic is an industrial country." (Page 45) The main industries include: machinery manufacturing industry, electrical industry, chemical industry, and optical precision instrument industry, etc. In addition, the shipbuilding industry, automobile industry, textile industry, and food industry also occupy a considerably important position. The industrial centers of the German Democratic Republic are closely related to geographical conditions. "Industry in the German Democratic Republic is concentrated in certain areas. On the one hand, lignite has become the center of industry, especially large chemical factories; on the other hand, large cities and some medium-sized cities are industrial centers, especially the efficient industries of iron, textiles, food, wood products, and the offset printing industry. Finally, several industrial centers are located in places with convenient transportation, such as rivers, canals, railway hubs, and coastal areas." (Page 46)
    Agriculture in the German Democratic Republic mainly produces food, and also produces industrial raw materials as a side product. From 1945 to 1947, the German Democratic Republic implemented land reform, thereby changing the face of the countryside. Tens of thousands of small farmers and farm laborers were given their own piece of land. "Due to the democratic land reform, not only was the democratization of the countryside completed, but also through the intensive cultivation of land, a substantial increase in agricultural production was promoted." (Page 54) The main crops in the German Democratic Republic are: potatoes, sugar beets, rye, wheat, barley, and oats.
    The means of transportation in the German Democratic Republic include railways, automobiles, inland navigation, and seagoing vessels. "Railway lines form a dense network; every large city and every large factory is connected by railway networks. ... The well-developed highway network is much denser than the railway network. Every place is connected to the highway network." (Page 67)
    The foreign trade of the German Democratic Republic is based on commerce with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Its foreign trade volume has been increasing year by year, more rapidly than the increase in production. "In 1948, the export volume of our foreign trade was three times that of 1947. In 1949, it increased to six and a half times. In 1950, it increased to thirteen times that of 1947." (Pages 71-72) They are also "planning to increase the export volume of foreign trade by 60 percent compared to 1950." (Page 72).
    "The German Democratic Republic in Reconstruction" briefly introduces the situation of the German Democratic Republic in a small number of pages. In enhancing the understanding and friendship between the people of China and Germany, the Chinese translation of this book has a certain significance.

    介绍“德意志民主共和国在重建中”

    “德意志民主共和国工业展览会”已于四月二十七日在北京开幕。“德意志民主共和国在重建中”一书，可以帮助大家对于民主德国获得更加全面和深刻的了解。
    本书共分七章，主要介绍了民主德国的领土、自然状况和矿产、工业、农林、交通、贸易、人口等概况，以及在一九五五年五年计划完成时将达到的建设目标。
    德意志民主共和国的领土为十万零八千方公里，人口约为二千万。“就行政区域而论，德意志民主共和国划分为州、区和市镇。”（第七十五页）全国由五个州组成。这五个州是：布兰登堡、梅格林堡、萨克森—安哈尔特、绍林吉亚和萨克森。“德国的首都大柏林的民主区，同样的受民主德国管理，但不属于德意志民主共和国。”（第十七页）
    希特勒的统治和第二次世界大战给德国人民留下了深重的灾难。广大的城市和乡村遭到破坏，成千成万的人民到处流浪，无家可归。重新建设的任务是很繁重和迫切的。因此，民主德国的人民在德国统一社会党的领导和苏联政府的支持下，实施了必要的民主改革。这就使“整个社会生活成为民主的生活，一切战争贩子和战犯受到惩罚，公共生活中清除了法西斯分子和反动分子，大地主和独占资本家的财产被没收，并分配给人民，民主的土地改革也完成了，广泛的学校改革，打破了有产阶级的教育垄断”（第七页），为重新建设打开了道路。
    民主德国的经济，一开始就是由劳动人民努力建立起来的。在一九四八年夏天开始进入计划经济——实行两年计划。两年计划，“仅仅十八个月便完成了。在一九五○年八月一日，生产达到战前一九三六年水平的百分之八十六。”（第十一页）接着便是一九五○年—一九五五年的五年计划。五年计划“规定大力扩充工业和农业生产，大量增加交通能力并恢复国内国外的贸易。在一九五五年，工业生产总额将达四百三十八亿德国马克，而一九五○年则为二百三十亿德国马克。……因此，在采矿工业方面，计划到一九五五年增加生产额百分之九十四。钢铁生产……将增加百分之一百三十七。……重机器的制造……计划增加百分之一百二十一。……建筑器材工业的产量将……增加百分之八十。……到一九五五年，纺织工业和轻工业的消费品生产总值将……增加百分之九十。……到一九五五年，运输吨位将比一九五○年增加百分之六十。”（第三十三—三十四页）五年计划将大大提高人民的生活水平。“在五年计划期间，工资将平均提高百分之十七，物价将降低百分之二十八，捐税也将降低。食物配给将完全废止。在某些方面，食物的平均消费量，和一九三六年比较，将达到更高的水平。”
    （第三十四页）
    煤和铁是现代工业最重要的原料，在民主德国，这两种原料都有相当的储藏量。煤的产地多在萨克森、布兰登堡两州境内。生铁产地在绍林吉亚。除去上述两种矿产外，民主德国还有铀、铜、锌、镁盐、石膏、石灰等矿藏。
    “民主德国是一个工业国家。”（第四十五页）主要的有：机器制造工业、电气工业、化学工业和光学精密仪器工业等。此外，造船工业、汽车工业、纺织工业和食品工业，也占着相当重要的地位。民主德国的工业中心是和地理条件息息相关的。民主德国的“工业集中在某些区域。一方面，褐煤成为工业尤其是大化学工厂的重心；一方面，大城市和部分中等城市是工业中心，特别是铁、纺织品、食物、木材等制成品的有效力的工业和胶印工业的中心。最后，若干工业中心设在交通便利的地方，如河流、运河、铁路中心以及沿海一带。”（第四十六页）
    民主德国的农业主要生产食粮，此外，还附带生产工业原料。一九四五年至一九四七年，民主德国实行了土地改革，从而改变了农村的面貌。成千成万的小农和雇农分得了自己的一份土地。“由于民主的土地改革，不仅完成了农村的民主化，而且还通过土地的集约耕作，促成了农业生产实质上的增加。”（第五十四页）民主德国的主要农作物有：马铃薯、糖萝卜、黑麦、小麦、大麦和燕麦等。
    民主德国的交通运输工具有铁路、汽车、内河航行和航海船只。“铁路线形成一幅稠密的网；每个大城市和每个大工厂都有铁路网联系着。……很发达的公路网远较铁道网为稠密。每个地方都和公路网联系着。”（第六十七页）
    民主德国的对外贸易，是以和苏联及人民民主国家通商为基础的。它的对外贸易额逐年增加，比生产的增加更为迅速。“一九四八年，我国对外贸易的输出额，等于一九四七年的三倍。一九四九年增加到六倍半。一九五○年比一九四七年增加到十三倍。”（第七十一—七十二页）他们还“正计划增加对外贸易的输出额，比一九五○年要增加百分之六十。”（第七十二页）。
    “德意志民主共和国在重建中”以不多的篇幅，简要地介绍了民主德国的情况。在增进中德两国人民的了解和友谊上，这本书的中译本是有其一定的意义的。
