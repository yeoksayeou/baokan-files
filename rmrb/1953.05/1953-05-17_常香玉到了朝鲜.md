At the end of March, good news arrived: "The motherland has sent another delegation!" "Patriotic artist Chang Xiangyu has also come!" Hearing this news at the front line, the comrades once again felt how warm the motherland is!

On April 4th, the Fifth Delegation of the People's Delegation to Korea met with comrades from the volunteer army's logistics units at the welcome rally. Amidst thunderous applause and cheers, and fluttering colorful paper, the comrades welcomed the delegation to Seokdong-ri as if celebrating a happy event.

"Present flowers to our loved ones!" Our cultural troupe members presented bouquets of flowers to the representatives of the delegation. These were the flowers of victory blooming on the battle-scarred Korean soil, and today they were given to our loved ones.

"We will definitely take the flowers back to Chairman Mao!" Before the portrait of Chairman Mao, Zhong Jimin, the head of the delegation, Chang Xiangyu, the deputy head, and the delegation representatives enthusiastically replied to the comrades while holding up the flowers.

That evening, Chang Xiangyu performed the most exciting program from the Xiangyu Opera Troupe's fundraising performance for donating airplanes – the famous Yu opera "Hua Mulan." The comrades had rarely seen Yu opera, but they were very familiar with Hua Mulan's patriotic deeds and heroic spirit; they also found Chang Xiangyu's impassioned and melodious tones and clear and meticulous movements very亲切. The comrades enjoyed the performance of the outstanding artist from the motherland to their heart's content, and it was almost dawn when they returned to their stations.

Along the way to Korea, Chang Xiangyu held soirees with the heroic volunteer army drivers and performed for the comrades at the supply stations. "If there's time, put on makeup; if there's no time, sing a cappella." In this way, Chang Xiangyu brought the voice of the motherland all the way to the volunteer army logistics units on the Korean front.

Chang Xiangyu had wanted to come to the Korean front to comfort the volunteer army for a long time. After returning from the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, she arrived just in time for the motherland to send cultural workers to the front to offer comfort, and Chang Xiangyu's wish was finally realized. This time, she even came to Korea with the delegation while ill. She said: "We feel that we should do more for the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and we should come to the front to see the comrades and sing for them. I am an actress, and what I can do for the motherland is to sing. Coming to the front is to sing for the comrades, and I can't rest easy if I don't sing."

When others talked about her and the Xiangyu Opera Troupe's contribution of donating a fighter plane, she humbly said: "The comrades at the front risk their lives and shed their blood to protect our happy life; and we only donated a plane for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, what does that count for!" She mentioned that last year, Li Xuesan, the head of the Volunteer Army delegation to China, presented them with a banner on behalf of the Volunteer Army, which made them feel supremely honored.

"Learn from the patriotism and internationalism of the Volunteer Army!" has become the working creed of the Xiangyu Opera Troupe. Before coming to Korea this time, all the comrades of the Xiangyu Opera Troupe put forward a guarantee: "One person plays the role of two, one person does the work of three." In this way, the forty-odd comrades who came to the front this time undertook the work of one hundred and thirty people in the troupe. During their group performances, an actor played the main role, and also the supporting role; played a soldier, and also an enemy soldier; did work on the stage, and also carried water and folded boxes backstage. The young actor Liu Fengqin, who is only thirteen years old this year, plays Hua Mulan's younger brother in the "Hua Mulan" play, plays a soldier, and also plays an enemy soldier, playing three roles alone; she helps with the backstage work after the performance; and writes comfort letters to the comrades when she has free time! In order to better comfort the "most beloved people," they perform at night, and during the day they go to various places in groups to offer comfort. A young comrade often performs five or six programs until the soldiers ask them to rest. In this way, regardless of day or night, and despite enemy aircraft harassment, they met with the vast number of soldiers on the logistics front in the agencies, sites, outposts, and anti-aircraft artillery positions of the logistics units.

Performing for the Volunteer Army soldiers is the most glorious thing Chang Xiangyu feels she has done in her twenty-plus years of performing, and she is also preparing to go to the front lines to meet more Volunteer Army soldiers. She said enthusiastically: "I also plan to go into the tunnels!"

Chang Xiangyu participated in the symposium introducing the logistics work of the Volunteer Army and the symposium of meritorious logistics unit personnel. She plans to adapt the heroic deeds of the front into Yu opera. When she left the logistics units to go forward, she earnestly expressed: "We are here this time to bring the heart of the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army, and to take the determination of the Volunteer Army back to tell the people of the motherland. We guarantee: we will support the Volunteer Army for as long as they fight!"

In recent days, letters of determination have been sent to the People's Delegation. One letter of determination reads: "Hearing your voices is like hearing the voice of the motherland. Please tell the people of the motherland: we are determined to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to the end, and we are ready to crush any adventurous attack by the enemy at any time to protect the people of the motherland and protect the little sisters of the Xiangyu Opera Troupe, who are only teenagers!"

    常香玉到了朝鲜
    康凌
    三月底，传来了好消息：“祖国人民又派慰问团来了！”“爱国艺人常香玉也来了！”同志们在战斗的前线听到了这个消息，再一次感到祖国是多么温暖啊！
    四月四日，祖国人民赴朝慰问文艺工作团第五团，在欢迎大会上和朝鲜前线的志愿军后勤部队的同志们见了面。在雷动的掌声和欢呼声中，在彩色纸片的飞舞中，同志们像办喜事一样，把慰问团的同志们迎到了石洞里。
    “向亲人献花！”我们的文工团员向慰问团的代表们献上了一束束的鲜花。这是开放在战斗的朝鲜土地上的胜利之花，今天送到了亲人的手里。
    “我们一定把鲜花带回去给毛主席！”在毛主席像前，慰问团的钟纪明团长、常香玉副团长和慰问团的代表们，高举着鲜花，向同志们热情地回答。
    当天晚上，常香玉就为同志们演出了香玉剧社捐献飞机义演中最精彩的节目——著名豫剧“花木兰”。同志们很少看过豫剧，但是对于花木兰爱国事迹和英雄气概，都非常熟悉；对于常香玉的激昂婉转的声调和明快细致的动作，也觉得十分亲切。同志们尽情地欣赏着祖国优秀艺人的表演，当返回到驻地的时候，天已经快亮了。
    常香玉在来朝鲜的沿途中，曾和英雄的志愿军司机们举行了联欢，给兵站的同志们演出。“来得及就化装，来不及就清唱。”这样，常香玉把祖国的声音一路带到了朝鲜前线的志愿军后勤部队里。
    常香玉早就要来朝鲜前线慰问志愿军了。她参加维也纳世界人民和平大会归来后，正赶上祖国人民要派遣文艺工作者来前线慰问，常香玉的愿望终于实现了。这次她还是带着病和慰问团同志们一起赶到朝鲜来的。她说：“我们觉得应该多为抗美援朝出些力，应该到前线来看看同志们，给同志们演唱。我是个演员，我为祖国能做的就是演唱，到前线来就是给同志们演唱的，不唱我放不下心去。”
    当别人谈起她和香玉剧社的同志们捐献一架战斗机的贡献时，她却谦逊地说：“前方同志拼了命，流了血，保卫了我们的幸福生活；而我们为了抗美援朝只捐献一架飞机，这能算得什么呢！”她谈起去年志愿军归国代表团李雪三团长曾代表志愿军赠给他们一面锦旗，使他们感到无上的光荣。
    “学习志愿军的爱国主义和国际主义精神！”已成了香玉剧社的工作信条了。这次来朝鲜慰问之前，香玉剧社全体同志又提出了保证：“一个人演两个人的角色，一个人办三个人的事。”这样，这次到前线来的四十几个同志就担任了剧社一百三十个人的工作。在他们分组演出时，一个演员演主角，也演配角；演正兵，也演反兵；干前场活，也在后台打水，叠箱。小演员刘凤琴，今年才十三岁，她在“花木兰”剧中，扮演花木兰的弟弟，演正兵，还演反兵，一个人演三个人的角色；下场就帮助后台工作；空下来还给同志们写慰问信呢！为了更好地慰问“最可爱的人”，他们夜间演出，白天还分组到各处去进行慰问，一个小同志时常演出五、六个节目，直到战士们要求他们休息时为止。这样，他们不分白天黑夜，不顾敌机骚扰，到了后勤部队的机关、现场、哨位和高射炮阵地，与后勤战线上的广大的战士们见了面。
    给志愿军战士们演出，是常香玉感觉自己在二十多年演出中的最光荣的事，她还准备到前沿去，和更多的志愿军战士们见面。她热情地说：“我还打算到坑道里去！”
    常香玉参加了介绍志愿军后勤工作的座谈会和后勤部队功臣座谈会。她计划把前方的英雄事迹编排成豫剧。当她离开后勤部队往前去的时候，她恳切地表示：“我们这次来是要把祖国人民的心意带给志愿军，把志愿军的决心带回去告诉祖国人民。我们保证：志愿军打到什么时候，我们就支援到什么时候！”
    连日来，一封封决心书送到了祖国人民慰问团里，有一封决心书里这样写着：“听到你们的声音，就像是听到了祖国的声音。请转告祖国人民：我们决心抗美援朝到底，随时准备粉碎敌人的任何冒险进攻，来保卫祖国人民，保卫香玉剧社一个个十几岁的小妹妹！”
