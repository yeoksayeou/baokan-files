    The CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee, in order to further promote the political theory education of cadres in service, convened a province-wide meeting of learning activists from April 26th to April 30th. The meeting was attended by propaganda ministers of the CPC committees of cities, counties, factories, and mines in Songjiang Province, outstanding part-time and full-time teachers, study instructors, study group leaders, student representatives, and Party branch representatives from various regions, totaling 188 people. At the meeting, Li Changqing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, first gave a report on the purpose, methods, and attitude of learning theory. He emphasized that in order to adapt to the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, it is necessary to strengthen the political theory learning of the vast number of cadres in service. He said that time is advancing and things are developing, and if we do not step up our learning, we will not be able to keep up with the development of the situation. He used examples of the Party's leadership in revolutionary struggles to illustrate the importance of theory guiding practical work. This enhanced the sense of responsibility of the attendees in leading the learning. Many representatives expressed their determination to do a better job of learning after returning. Secondly, the director of the Theoretical Education Section of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department made a summary of the province's cadre theory learning over the past ten months (from July last year to April this year). This summary appropriately estimated and affirmed the achievements and experiences of the past stage of learning, briefly analyzed the current problems in learning, and put forward requirements for the future.
    Liu Zuyu, Secretary of the Ning'an County Party Committee, specifically introduced their experience in adhering to learning and leading learning at the meeting, which greatly enlightened all the representatives. In particular, the propaganda ministers of the county Party committees recognized from Ning'an's experience that county organs are also fully capable of doing a good job in the political theory learning of cadres in service. The key lies in the leadership's attention, especially in the active work of the county Party committee's propaganda department. Some made self-criticisms: "In the past, I thought that cadres in the county often went to the countryside, and learning could not be done well, but after hearing about Ning'an's experience, I have nothing to say this time." At the same time, the meeting organized representatives to learn from the experience of Shenyang and Tangshan in running night Party schools, and specifically introduced the experience of the province in running cadre spare-time political schools, the Party branch's guarantee and supervision of cadre learning, as well as the work of learning guidance and teaching. The representatives generally felt that they had learned a lot of methods for leading learning from this meeting, and basically solved the problems that needed to be solved, thus enhancing their confidence in doing a good job in cadre learning and creating favorable conditions for further development of theoretical education in the future.
    At the end of the meeting, Yu Lin, Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department, made a summary, focusing on explaining the practices of the representatives after returning, and elaborating on the relationship between learning and production. He reminded everyone to pay attention to preventing two kinds of deviations when implementing the spirit of this meeting. One deviation is impatience, which can lead to greed for quick success, coercion, and commandism. He said that theoretical education cannot be done well overnight, and it is necessary to have perseverance and carry out long-term sustained work. In particular, attention should be paid to ideological leadership. The other deviation is lack of confidence, such as simply emphasizing and relying on the work of certain comrades of the Party committee, while ignoring or relaxing the active side of the propaganda department. Yu Lin pointed out that the success of learning is related to the Party committee's attention, but the main responsibility lies with the Party committee's propaganda department, which requires the Party committee's propaganda department to actively carry out work and obtain the leadership and support of the Party committee. At the meeting, awards were given to units and individuals with outstanding learning achievements. The award recipients included: provincial directly affiliated organs, Ning'an County and other three spare-time political schools, the CPC Songjiang Provincial Government Health Department branch and other five branches, nine teachers, three instructors, three study group leaders, and ten students.

    中共松江省委召开学习活动分子会议
    中共松江省委为了把在职干部的政治理论教育工作继续推向前进，曾于四月二十六日至四月三十日，召开了全省的学习活动分子会议。到会的有松江省各市、县和厂矿的党委宣传部长，各地业余政治学校优秀的兼职和专职教员、学习辅导员、学习小组长、学员代表和党支部代表共一百八十八人。会上首先由省委书记李常青同志作了关于学习理论的目的、方法和学习态度等问题的报告。他强调指出：为了适应国家大规模经济建设的需要，就必须加强广大在职干部的政治理论学习。他说，时间在前进，事物在发展，如果我们不加紧学习，就跟不上形势的发展。他用党领导革命斗争的实例，说明理论指导实际工作的重要意义。从而增强了到会人员领导学习的责任心，许多代表纷纷表示决心：回去一定要把学习搞得更好。其次，由省委宣传部理论教育处处长作了十个月来（从去年七月到今年四月）全省干部理论学习的总结。这个总结对于过去一个阶段的学习成绩和经验作了适当的估计和肯定，并对当前学习中存在的问题作了简要的分析，提出了今后的要求。
    宁安县委书记刘祖裕同志在会上具体地介绍了他们怎样坚持学习和领导学习的经验，给全体代表的启示很大，特别是各县县委宣传部长，从宁安的经验中认识到县机关也完全有条件搞好在职干部的政治理论学习，关键就在于领导的重视，尤其是在于县委宣传部积极主动地工作。有的检讨说：“过去我认为县里的干部常下乡，学习没个搞好，可是听到宁安的经验后，这回没啥说的了。”同时，这次会议组织代表们学习了沈阳、唐山举办夜党校的经验，并具体介绍了省内办干部业余政治学校、党支部保证、监督干部学习以及学习辅导工作和教学工作的经验。代表们普遍感到从这次会议学到了不少领导学习的方法，基本上解决了所要解决的问题，因而增强了搞好干部学习的信心，为进一步开展今后的理论教育工作创造了有利条件。
    会议最后由省委宣传部部长于林同志作总结，他着重地交代了代表们回去后的作法，阐述了学习和生产的关系。他提醒大家在回去贯彻这次会议的精神时，要注意防止两种偏向。一种偏向是急躁情绪，这种情绪会促成贪多冒进以至强迫命令等作法。他说，理论教育工作不是一朝一夕就能搞好的，必须有坚忍精神，进行长期的坚持的工作。特别是要注意思想领导。另一种偏向是信心不足，如单纯强调和依靠党委某些同志的工作，而忽视或放松宣传部积极主动的一面。于林同志指出：学习搞得好坏和党委的重视有关，但主要的责任还在于党委宣传部，这就要求党委宣传部积极主动地进行工作，去取得党委的领导和支持。会上对于学习有成绩的单位和个人进行了奖励，受到奖励的有：省直属机关、宁安县等三个业余政治学校、中共松江省府卫生厅支部等五个支部、九名教员、三名辅导员、三名学习小组长、十名学员。
