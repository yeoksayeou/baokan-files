Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 15th: This correspondent reports that the US side's representatives continue to insist on handing over the non-directly repatriated Korean prisoners of war to their enemy, Syngman Rhee. This demand will undermine the basis for resuming negotiations and push the negotiations backward.

General Nam Il pointed out: "It will allow more than two-thirds of our non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to be forcibly detained directly under the guise of 'release as civilians' after the armistice." Under the guise of "release as civilians," non-directly repatriated Chinese prisoners of war will also be forcibly detained after spending a short period of sixty days under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

General Nam Il's clear analysis of Harrison's counter-proposal shows that it is completely contrary to the eight-point proposal of the Korean and Chinese sides. Harrison said that he had accepted "most" of the eight-point proposal and that he had "accepted all but one point." This propaganda is clearly an attempt to deceive world opinion and conceal the fact that the US counter-proposal is actually a rejection of an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

First, Harrison violated the principle already agreed upon by both sides, which is that non-directly repatriated prisoners of war should be handed over to a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to seek a fair resolution to the issue of their repatriation.

Second, he prevented the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from exercising its functions and placed it under the threat of the United States, rendering the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission useless.

Third, he put forward various restrictions so that the work of explaining to the prisoners of war to enable them to return to their motherland could not be carried out freely and conveniently. He also insisted on setting the time limit to a short sixty days.

General Nam Il said that the essence of the US counter-proposal is a "forced detention plan." He asked Harrison: "If your side does not want to forcibly detain prisoners of war, why are you so afraid to hand over the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for supervision? Why are you so afraid of allowing the side to which the prisoners of war belong to have sufficient freedom to explain to them?" Harrison had nothing to say when he heard these sharp questions. These questions exposed the US attempt to prevent prisoners of war from returning home.

Harrison's repeated slander of neutral countries shows that Washington is very afraid of a ceasefire. This time, he tried his best to slander Poland and Czechoslovakia, and said that Asian countries were "under pressure," even though the neutral countries were acting according to a common agreement.

General Nam Il pointed out that this slander of neutral countries only shows more clearly that the US side has no sincerity in allowing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to effectively perform its functions, and exposes the US conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

The US side brought out the old obstacle again - insisting that 50,000 South Korean prisoners of war were missing, which also exposed the US's fear of a ceasefire. This non-existent problem was refuted long ago in the negotiation process, but Harrison has now brought up this issue again, and said:

"The shadow of this problem hangs over this meeting." The reappearance of this problem in the meeting once again proves that Harrison is using delaying tactics to escape the immediate ceasefire that is possible due to General Nam Il's eight-point plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 15th: This correspondent reports that the US chief representative, Harrison, could not deny that his request to hand over non-directly repatriated Korean prisoners of war to Syngman Rhee after the armistice was actually an attempt to overturn the basis for resuming ceasefire negotiations. In order to divert people's attention from this behavior, he insisted that he had agreed to the "main parts" of General Nam Il's eight-point plan.

The ceasefire negotiations were resumed twenty days ago on the basis of resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in two steps: immediately exchanging prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation after the armistice and handing over non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to a neutral country in order to fairly resolve their repatriation issue. In a letter dated April 16, shortly before the resumption of negotiations, Harrison suggested: "For practical purposes, the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should be released to a neutral country for accommodation in Korea."

Observers pointed out that Harrison's request to undermine the basis for resuming negotiations and push the negotiations backward has no more than two purposes: (1) to avoid the ceasefire that could have been implemented immediately on the basis of General Nam Il's eight-point plan, and (2) to forcibly detain non-directly repatriated prisoners of war after the armistice.

Harrison's unreasonable and uncooperative attitude can be clearly seen from his questions at the plenary session on the 15th. In addition to making requests aimed at overturning the basis of the negotiations, Harrison also asked: "What does your side suggest? We are waiting to know." This is a deliberate mockery of world public opinion that demands a swift ceasefire in Korea, which is in line with the "go it alone" policy expressed by Republican Policy Committee Chairman Knowland in the US Senate when world opinion demanded peace.

In the ceasefire negotiations, every day there is new evidence proving that Washington is afraid of a ceasefire, and the progress that the Korean and Chinese representatives have worked so hard to achieve is obstructed by the US representatives at every step.

The main obstacle created by the United States in the past was "no forced repatriation," but the Korean and Chinese sides suggested resolving the prisoner of war issue in two steps, which removed this obstacle.

Harrison stubbornly refused to send non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to a neutral country and insisted on keeping them in Korea, under the care of a neutral country.

General Nam Il put forward his eight-point plan, stipulating that prisoners of war should be handed over to a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody in Korea. This once again removed the obstacles set by the United States in the way of reaching an agreement.

Harrison immediately turned around and demanded that Korean prisoners of war be released on the spot in South Korea instead of being handed over to neutral countries for custody.

Harrison slandered the neutral countries that make up the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Moreover, he is afraid that neutral countries will effectively carry out their tasks, which is to lift the detaining party's control over the prisoners of war so that the prisoners of war can express their will. The large number of restrictions he has put forward is enough to illustrate his fear.

Only the Korean and Chinese representatives have shown efforts to strive for a ceasefire. Despite Harrison's statements slandering neutral countries, despite his delaying tactics, the fact that he is undermining the basis for resuming ceasefire negotiations cannot be hidden from the people of the world, because all peace-loving people have high expectations for this re-started negotiation. If Washington had not ordered Harrison to overturn the basis for resuming negotiations, an agreement could have been reached immediately and a ceasefire implemented.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 15th: This correspondent reports that before putting forward his counter-proposal, Harrison claimed, "I am now going to read out our proposal to you and ask you to study this proposal in the spirit of constructive negotiation that our side adopted when studying your eight-point proposal, which is the basis of our proposal." Harrison was clearly trying to use this sentence to make people believe that this counter-proposal was based on the eight-point plan of the Korean and Chinese sides, and that it was the result of the US side's "study" of the eight-point plan in the "spirit of constructive negotiation." However, the counter-proposal put forward by Harrison proves that these are nothing but self-deception, the purpose of which is nothing more than to cover up the fact that the US side is attempting to substantially overturn the basis for resuming ceasefire negotiations.

Harrison is the chief representative of the US negotiating delegation, and people certainly have sufficient reason to demand that he understand basic logic. But Harrison, whether due to ignorance or for ulterior motives, has now placed himself in extreme logical confusion once again. According to Harrison, his counter-proposal is based on the eight-point plan of the Korean and Chinese sides on May 7. Everyone knows that the eight-point plan of the Korean and Chinese sides is based on a proposal put forward by the governments of China and North Korea at the end of March to resolve the prisoner of war issue. The most basic content of this proposal is that the negotiating parties should ensure the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation after the armistice, and transfer the remaining non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to a neutral country to ensure a fair resolution of the issue of their repatriation. Harrison himself acknowledged this principle in his letter to our side on April 16, and put forward three suggestions, requesting that prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated be released to a neutral country for accommodation in Korea. Until May 5, he still admitted that this proposal was the basis for resuming negotiations.

It was on the basis of this proposal that the Korean and Chinese sides put forward a six-point plan on April 26 to resolve the entire issue of prisoner of war repatriation. Later, in order to remove the obstacles set by the US side on the road to ceasefire, they put forward an eight-point plan on May 7. The main points of this plan are: (1) all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation will be directly repatriated immediately after the armistice; (2) non-directly repatriated prisoners of war will be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for management;

(3) relevant parties have full freedom and convenience to explain to their prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so that they can eliminate their doubts and fears and be able to return home; (4) if there are still prisoners of war who have not been repatriated after the four-month explanation period, their handling will be negotiated and resolved by a political conference. Just one of the key points of this plan, that is, handing over non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, stipulates that non-directly repatriated prisoners of war should be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission composed of five neutral countries for custody, so that the country to which the prisoners of war belong can have full freedom and convenience to explain to the prisoners of war within a four-month period, thereby eliminating their fear of not daring to return home and enabling them to return to their motherland.

From this point of view, it is obvious that the Korean and Chinese sides are adhering to the basis for resuming ceasefire negotiations, and at the same time, in order to make the ceasefire happen quickly, they have made concessions to the demands of the US side. But now, what can prove that Harrison's counter-proposal is based on the eight-point plan of the Korean and Chinese sides? Harrison's counter-proposal stipulates that all captured personnel of the non-directly repatriated Korean People's Army should be "released" on the spot on the date the armistice agreement takes effect, "so that they become civilians"; the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who have not been repatriated after the 60-day explanation period will also be "released" on the spot, "so that they become civilians." To put it bluntly, this is: all prisoners of war who have not been repatriated, whether they are captured personnel of the Korean People's Army or captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, will be detained in South Korea and eventually fall into the hands of their mortal enemies, Syngman Rhee or Chiang Kai-shek. What is the similarity between this and the plan of the Korean and Chinese sides? What is the similarity between this and the principle of handing over non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral countries for custody, which is the basis for the resumption of negotiations?

The matter is already very clear. The plan of the Korean and Chinese sides is to ensure that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is resolved fairly and reasonably, while the US counter-proposal is to ensure the forced detention of prisoners of war. The plan of the Korean and Chinese sides adheres to the basis for resuming ceasefire negotiations, while the US counter-proposal attempts to undermine the basis for resuming ceasefire negotiations. Harrison said that the US side had studied the plan of the Korean and Chinese sides with "sincere spirit," but the facts prove that the US side has no sincerity in making the ceasefire happen quickly on the basis of the Korean-Chinese eight-point plan, but rather abandons this plan and makes it impossible to achieve a ceasefire.

The eight-point plan of the Korean and Chinese sides is so reasonable that it has won widespread sympathy and support from the world. Even Churchill, in his speech on the 11th, believed that the "proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides to deal with the issue of prisoners of war who are afraid to go home" by five neutral countries, "we have no reason to believe that this cannot become the basis for reaching an agreement." It is precisely for this reason that Harrison, when putting forward his counter-proposal, had to pretend that this counter-proposal was based on the eight-point plan of the Korean and Chinese sides in order to escape the condemnation of world public opinion. However, Harrison was not able to hide the truth after all. On May 13, when Harrison talked about the eight-point plan of the Korean and Chinese sides on May 7 before putting forward the counter-proposal, he hypocritically said, "We believe that most of this proposal is acceptable." But one day later, on May 14, according to a broadcast by the US military radio station in Tokyo, Harrison told reporters outside the meeting that "the proposal of May 7 is absolutely unacceptable to the United States." Harrison's self-contradictory statement proves that the warmongers in the United States are disregarding world public opinion's demands for a swift ceasefire in Korea, and are trying their best to obstruct the ceasefire negotiations from reaching an agreement in order to continue the war.

    美方的“反建议”证明美方害怕立即停战
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者报道，美方代表继续坚持把不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘交给他们的敌人李承晚，这个要求将会破坏恢复谈判的基础，而把谈判拖向后退。
    南日大将指出：“它将使三分之二以上的我方不直接遣返的被俘人员，在停战后即行就地释放的名义下直接地被强迫扣留。”在“释放为平民身份”的名义下，不直接遣返的中国籍战俘在中立国遣返委员会看管下度过了短短的六十天的期限以后，也将被强迫扣留。
    南日大将对哈利逊的反建议的明确分析，显示出这是和朝中方面的八点建议完全相反的。哈利逊说他已经接受了八点建议的“大部分”并且说他“除去一点以外，已经接受了所有的几点”，这种宣传显然是企图欺骗世界舆论和掩盖这样的事实：美方的反建议实际上就是拒绝立即实现朝鲜停战。
    第一，哈利逊违背了双方已经取得协议的原则，就是：不直接遣返的战俘应该交给一个中立国遣返委员会，以求得对他们遣返问题的公正解决。
    第二，他使中立国遣返委员会不能行使它的职权，并且使它处于美国的威胁之下，以致中立国遣返委员会毫无用处。
    第三，他提出了种种限制，以致向战俘进行解释以使他们回返祖国的工作不能得到自由和便利。他还坚持把期限规定为短短的六十天。
    南日大将说，美方反建议的本质就是一个“强迫扣留的方案”。他问哈利逊道：“如果你方不想强迫扣留战俘，为什么你们这样害怕把不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会去看管呢？为什么你们这样害怕让战俘所属的一方有足够的自由来向他们解释呢？”哈利逊听到这些尖锐的问题，没话可说。这些问题揭露了美方阻止战俘回家的企图。
    哈利逊再度污蔑中立国的发言，显示出华盛顿是非常害怕停战的。这次，他极力污蔑波兰和捷克斯洛伐克，并且说亚洲国家“受到压力”，虽然中立国是根据共同协议来办事的。
    南日大将指出，这种对中立国的污蔑只是更加清楚地显示出美方没有诚意让中立国遣返委员会有效地执行它的职权，并且暴露出美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
    美方又搬出来老的障碍——硬说有五万名南朝鲜战俘失踪了，这也暴露出美方是害怕停战的。这个根本不存在的问题在谈判的过程中很久以前就被驳斥了，但是哈利逊现在又搬出这个问题，并且说：
    “这个问题的阴影笼罩着这个会议”。这个问题在会议中重新出现，再一次证明了哈利逊是在使用拖延策略，逃避由于南日大将的八点方案而成为可能的立即停战。
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者报道：美方首席代表哈利逊无法否认，他要求将不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘在停战后送交李承晚，实际上就是企图推翻恢复停战谈判的基础。为了转移人们对这种行为的注意，他就硬说他已同意了南日大将八点方案的“主要部分”。
    停战谈判是二十天以前，在分两个步骤解决战俘遣返问题的基础上恢复的：在停战后立即交换坚持遣返的战俘并将不直接遣返的战俘交给一个中立国，以便公正地解决他们的遣返问题。哈利逊在谈判恢复前不久的四月十六日的信里曾建议：“为求实际可行，未被直接遣返的战俘释交中立国在朝鲜收容。”
    观察家们指出，哈利逊提出这种破坏恢复谈判的基础并使谈判倒退的要求，不外两个目的：（一）避免本来可以立即在南日大将的八点方案的基础上实行的停战，（二）在停战后强迫扣留不直接遣返的战俘。
    哈利逊的蛮横无理和毫无协商精神的态度，从他十五日在全体会议上的问话中可以明显地看出来。哈利逊除了提出以推翻谈判基础为目的的要求以外，还问：“你方建议怎么办？我们等着要知道。”这是对要求迅速获致朝鲜停战的世界舆论的一种蓄意的嘲弄，这和美国参议院共和党政策委员会主席诺兰在全世界舆论要求和平的时候所表示的“单独干下去”的政策是符合的。
    在停战谈判当中，每一天都有新的证据证明华盛顿害怕停战，朝中代表费尽力量争取得来的进展，在每一步上都受到美国代表的阻挠。
    美国过去制造的主要障碍就是“不强迫遣返”，后来朝中方面建议把战俘问题分成两个步骤解决，就把这个障碍扫除了。
    哈利逊顽固地拒绝把不直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去，并坚决主张把他们留在朝鲜境内，交给一个中立国看管。
    南日大将提出了他的八点方案，规定把战俘交给一个中立国遣返委员会在朝鲜看管这就再次扫除了美国在取得协议的道路上设下的障碍。
    哈利逊马上就向后转，他要求在南朝鲜就地释放朝鲜籍战俘，而不把他们交给中立国看管。
    哈利逊诬蔑组成中立国遣返委员会的中立国。而且，他害怕中立国有效地执行它的任务，这就是：解除拘留一方对战俘的控制，让战俘能够表达他们的意志。他所提出的一大堆限制就足以说明他这种惧怕的心情。
    只有朝、中代表表现了争取停战的努力。尽管哈利逊发表诬蔑中立国的声明，尽管他采取拖延策略，但是他破坏恢复停战谈判的基础的事实也是瞒不过全世界人民的，因为全体爱好和平的人民都对这次重新开始的谈判寄予很大的期望。要不是华盛顿命令哈利逊推翻恢复谈判的基础，本来是立即可以取得协议并实行停战的。
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者报道：哈利逊在提出他的反建议之前声称，“我现在要向你方宣读我方建议，并要求你方本着我方在研究作为我方建议的基础的你方八点建议时所抱的那种建设性谈判的精神，来研究这个建议。”哈利逊显然企图用这句话使人相信：这个反建议是以朝中方面的八点方案为基础的，而且是美方以“建设性谈判的精神”“研究”了八点方案的结果。可是哈利逊提出的反建议，却证明这些都不过是自欺欺人之谈，其目的无非是为了掩盖这样一个事实，这就是美方企图实质上完全推翻恢复停战谈判的基础。
    哈利逊是美方谈判代表团首席代表，人们当然有充分的理由要求他懂得起码的逻辑学。可是哈利逊如果不是由于无知，就是由于不可告人的理由，现在却使自己又一次陷于逻辑上的极端混乱了。照哈利逊的说法，他的反建议是以朝中方面五月七日的八点方案为基础的。谁都知道，朝中方面的八点方案是以中朝两国政府在三月底提出的一项解决战俘问题的建议为基础的。这项建议的最基本的内容，就是谈判双方应该保证在停战以后立即遣返所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。哈利逊自己在四月十六日给我方的信中承认了这个原则，并且提出了三项建议，要求将未被直接遣返的战俘在朝鲜释交中立国收容。一直到五月五日，他还承认这个建议是恢复谈判的基础。
    正是在这项建议的基础上，朝中方面在四月二十六日提出了解决整个遣返战俘问题的六点方案，后来为了扫清美方在停战道路上安设的障碍，又在五月七日提出了八点方案。这个方案的要点是：（一）停战后所有坚持遣返的战俘立即直接遣返；（二）不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国遣返委员会接管，
    （三）有关方面对其所属的在中立国遣返委员会看管下战俘有充分的解释自由与便利，使其消除疑惧并得以回家；（四）四个月的解释期满后如尚有未遣返的战俘，其处理交由政治会议协商解决。单就这个方案的要点之一，即将不直接遣返战俘交给中立国遣返委员会这一点来说，方案规定将不直接遣返的战俘交给由五个中立国家组成的中立国遣返委员会看管，以便战俘所属的国家在四个月的期限内有充分的自由和便利向战俘进行解释，从而消除他们不敢回家的疑惧心理，使他们得以返回祖国。
    从这一点看来，朝中方面坚守恢复停战谈判的基础，同时为了使停战迅速实现，对美方的要求作了让步，这是一望而知的。可是现在，有什么东西可以证明哈利逊的反建议是以朝中方面的八点方案为基础的呢？哈利逊的反建议规定将不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军的被俘人员在停战协定生效之日全部予以就地“释放”，“使之成为平民”；在六十天的解释期满之后仍未被遣返的中国人民志愿军的被俘人员也予以就地“释放”，“使之成为平民”。如果直截了当地说，这就是：凡是未被遣返的战俘，不管是朝鲜人民军的被俘人员还是中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，都要被扣留在南朝鲜，最后落到他们的死敌李承晚或蒋介石的手里去。这和朝中方面的方案有什么相同之处呢？这和作为谈判恢复的基础的、将不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国看管的原则有什么相同之处呢？
    事情已经非常清楚，朝中方面的方案是要保证战俘的遣返问题得到公正合理的解决，而美方的反建议却是要保证强迫扣留战俘；朝中方面的方案坚守恢复停战谈判的基础，而美方的反建议却企图破坏恢复停战谈判的基础。哈利逊说美方曾经以“诚挚精神”研究了朝中方面的方案，但是事实证明，美方并没有诚意来在中朝八点方案的基础上使停战迅速实现，而是抛开这个方案而使停战无法实现。
    朝中方面的八点方案是如此合情合理，因而获得了全世界的广泛同情和拥护。连邱吉尔也在他十一日的演说中认为，朝中方面提出的由五个中立国处理“害怕回家的战俘问题的建议”，“我们没有理由认为这不可能成为达成协议的基础”。正是由于这个原故，哈利逊在提出他的反建议的时候，不得不伪装出这个反建议是以朝中方面的八点方案为基础的，以便逃避世界舆论的谴责。但是，哈利逊毕竟没有能够掩藏得住真情。五月十三日，哈利逊在提出反建议之前谈到朝中方面五月七日的八点方案时，假惺惺地说，“我们认为，这个建议大部分是可以接受的。”可是过了一天，五月十四日，据东京美军军中电台广播，哈利逊在会外对记者说，“五月七日的建议是绝对不能为美国接受的。”哈利逊这种自相矛盾的说法，证明美国的好战分子，正在不顾世界舆论关于迅速实现朝鲜停战要求，正在竭力企图阻挠停战谈判达成协议，以便继续进行战争。
