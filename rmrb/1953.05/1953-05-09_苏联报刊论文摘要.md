Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

The Communist Party Member is an Active Fighter of the Party

On April 20th, the Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Prasov, Secretary of the Molotov Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, entitled "The Communist Party Member is an Active Fighter of the Party," pointing out how to give play to the initiative of Communist Party members. The abstract is as follows:

Party grassroots organizations play a significant role in educating Communist Party members and enhancing their initiative. In implementing the resolutions of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Molotov Oblast Committee has paid great attention to improving the work of grassroots party organizations, requiring the municipal and district committees to provide more specific leadership to the grassroots organizations.

It should be pointed out that many party committees still hold too many meetings of various kinds and pass a large number of resolutions. This inevitably leads the municipal and district committee organs to mainly engage in writing various reports, reference documents, and resolutions, and often they do not have time to do organizational work to implement the adopted resolutions. Now the Oblast Committee is taking measures to free the party organs from office work and concentrate its efforts on the main problems – checking implementation, organizational work related to the implementation of party resolutions, and political work among the masses.

An important tool for educating party members and attracting them to engage in the practical work of implementing party resolutions is the tasks given to them by the party. A shortcoming should be pointed out in this regard. We usually give party members regular tasks, such as party propagandists and agitators. However, not all Communist Party members can take on this kind of work, so in addition to regular tasks, it is necessary to give Communist Party members temporary tasks related to the implementation of a certain party resolution. These tasks should be specific. Such tasks can help check the professional and organizational capabilities of Communist Party members, and at the same time help them improve politically.

The plenary sessions of party committees, meetings of activists, and general meetings of grassroots party organizations play a great role in enhancing the combat effectiveness of party organizations and giving play to the initiative of party members. Now the party committees of various cities and districts in our Oblast have held meetings in accordance with the periods stipulated in the Party Constitution. However, some municipal and district committees still have formalism in preparing and conducting meetings. In addition, the role of party members' meetings in some party organizations has also been reduced. Meetings are often poorly prepared, and sometimes secondary issues are discussed.

Effective methods for educating Communist Party members and enhancing their political initiative are criticism and self-criticism. However, self-criticism and criticism from below will only be promoted when those who make healthy criticisms believe that they can get organizational support and that the shortcomings they point out can actually be overcome.

Correctly Combine Political Work with Economic Work

The "Pravda" published an editorial on April 18th entitled "Correctly Combine Political Work with Economic Work." The article pointed out the correct relationship between political work and economic work. The abstract is as follows:

Party organs are political leadership organs. This means that party organs realize the leadership of Soviet and economic organs in their own way. The party's method of leading economic organs is to constantly guide and supervise their activities, systematically help them, and consolidate them. It is not to ignore these organs, but to lead the economy through them.

Correctly leading the economy does not allow for monopolizing the work of Soviet organs, agricultural organs, and purchasing organs, nor does it allow for phenomena of concern for various trivial matters of these organs and making them unaccountable. Instead, it is necessary to improve the leadership over them. If the party organization does not supervise the work of these organs but replaces them to solve economic problems, then this incorrect situation must be terminated. Party committees should always be concerned with improving the work of Soviet and economic organs, consolidate them with reviewed and well-educated cadres, and improve their sense of responsibility for the cause entrusted to them and for striving to complete the national plan on time and implement the instructions of the party and the government.

Requiring to do everything possible to improve the party's political work and to terminate the phenomenon of making Soviet and economic organs unaccountable does not mean that the party organization can slightly weaken its attention to economic issues, let alone get rid of economic work. On the contrary, this means to strengthen the party's leadership over the activities of the state and the economy, which means that this leadership should be healthier and more effective. The party organization frees itself from trivial economic matters, and can and should more effectively lead the economy, raising important and principled issues in the development of industry, transportation, trade, and agriculture.

The party's political work is the foundation of economic achievements. The mission of the party's political work is to arouse the broad masses of working people to solve specific economic tasks. Political work is a powerful tool for giving play to the labor initiative of Soviet people in the struggle to realize the party's policies and resolutions.

Improve the Effectiveness of Collective Contracts

At present, Soviet enterprises are conducting the first mass inspection of the collective contracts for 1953. The "Labor Daily" published an editorial on this issue on April 18th, pointing out that mobilizing the broad masses of workers and staff to actively participate in this work is the key to making the inspection fully effective. The abstract is as follows:

Years of experience have proved that collective contracts have great power only where economic organizations and trade union organizations regularly care about the implementation of collective contracts, and only where strict supervision of the implementation of contracts by both leaders and the masses has been established. Only by combining top-down and bottom-up inspections can the high effectiveness of both parties' fulfillment of obligations be guaranteed.

Soviet people summarize and check their work not only to see their achievements. Checking the implementation is primarily to expose shortcomings, make suggestions to honest workers, punish personnel who are unwilling to correct their mistakes, and strive to realize the adopted resolutions. The main task of the mass inspection of the implementation of collective contracts currently underway is precisely this.

Mass inspections can only play the greatest effect when they are carried out as a broad public review of the work of the enterprise, and only when all employees participate in this work. Here, the standing committee of the trade union factory committee, which is responsible for regular supervision of both parties' fulfillment of obligations, must naturally take an active part in this work first.

Discussing work summaries at general meetings is an important step in conducting mass inspections. Each such meeting should be a broad platform for conducting courageous and sharp criticism of shortcomings. The responsibility of the leaders of economic and trade union organizations is to create all the necessary conditions for this matter. It is necessary to resolutely oppose the practice of many enterprises last year of hastily holding meetings during lunch breaks. In addition, attempts to replace general meetings with representative meetings without any basis should also be prevented. Leaders of trade union and economic organizations must create all necessary conditions so that every employee can speak freely, criticize without regard to face, and make suggestions. The high and strict demands of the masses will force those who have forgotten the responsibility of fulfilling collective contracts, those who generously promise but do not fulfill them, to cheer up.

All criticisms and suggestions raised at the workers' meetings must be carefully considered and summarized, the deadline for completing them must be determined, and the person in charge must be designated. Only in this way will the inspection be effective and promote the smooth implementation of collective contracts.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    共产党员是党的积极战士
    四月二十日苏联“真理报”刊载了苏共莫洛托夫州委书记普拉斯所作以“共产党员是党的积极战士”为题的论文，指出怎样发挥共产党员的积极性。摘要如下：
    在教育共产党员和提高他们的积极性方面，党的基层组织起着很大的作用。莫洛托夫州委会在实现党的第十九次代表大会的决议时，很注意改善基层党组织的工作，要求市委会和区委会要更加具体地领导基层组织。
    应该指出，许多党委会举行各种各样的会议还是太多，通过了大量的决议。这不可避免地使市委会和区委会机关主要地是从事于编写各种报告、参考文件和决议，而时常没有时间去做对执行所通过的决议的组织工作。现在州委会就正在采取措施使党的机关摆脱办公厅的工作，集中努力于主要的问题——检查执行情况，有关实现党的决议的组织工作，群众中的政治工作。
    教育党员并吸引他们从事执行党的决议的实际工作的重要工具，便是党给与他们的任务。在这方面应该指出一个缺点。我们通常是给党员以经常的任务，例如党的宣传员和鼓动员等。但是，并不是全体共产党员都能担任这种工作，所以除经常任务之外，必须也给共产党员们以有关执行党的某项决议的临时任务，这些任务要具体。这种任务能帮助检查共产党员的业务能力和组织能力，同时能帮助党员政治上的提高。
    在提高党组织的战斗性，在发挥党员的积极性方面，党委会的全会、积极分子会议以及基层党组织的大会都有很大的作用。现在我们州内的各个市和区的党委会全会，都已按党章所规定的时期举行会议。然而有一些市委会和区委会在准备和进行会议方面，还是有形式主义现象。此外，有些党组织的党员大会的作用也被降低了，会议时常是准备得不好，有时讨论次要的问题。
    教育共产党员，提高他们的政治积极性的有效方法，是批评和自我批评。但是，自我批评和来自下面的批评，只有在提出健康的批评的人相信他能得到组织的支持同时他所指出的缺点能实际上克服时，才会发扬起来。
    正确地把政治工作和经济工作结合起来
    “真理报”四月十八日以“正确地把政治工作和经济工作结合起来”为题发表社论。该文指出政治工作与经济工作的正确关系。摘要如下：
    党机关是政治领导机关。这就是说，党机关以它自己的方法来实现对苏维埃和经济机关的领导。党对经济机关的领导方法就是经常指导和监督它们的活动，有系统地帮助它们，巩固它们，不要不顾这些机关，而要通过它们来领导经济。
    正确地领导经济，是不允许包办代替苏维埃机关、农业机关和储购机关的工作的，不允许有关怀这些机关的各种琐碎事务和使它们无责可负的现象的，而是要改善对它们的领导。如果党组织不是监督这些机关的工作而是代替它们来解决经济问题的话，那么就要终止这种不正确的情况。党委会应当经常关心于改善苏维埃机关和经济机关的工作，要以审查过的、受过很好的教育的干部来巩固它们，并要提高它们对被委托的事业、对争取按时完成国家计划、执行党和政府的指令的责任感。
    要求尽力改善党的政治工作和终止使苏维埃和经济机关的无责可负的现象，完全不是说党组织就能够稍微削弱自己对经济问题的注意，更不是说摆脱经济工作。相反，这是说要加强党对国家和经济的活动的领导，是说这种领导要更健全和更有效果。党组织摆脱开琐碎的经济事务，能够而且应当更有成效地领导经济，提出工业、运输、贸易和农业发展方面的重要的、原则性的问题。
    党的政治工作就是经济成就的基础。党的政治工作的使命，就是唤起广大劳动群众来解决具体的经济任务。政治工作是发挥苏维埃人在争取实现党的政策和决议的斗争中的劳动积极性的强有力工具。
    提高集体合同的效能
    目前苏联的各企业正在对一九五三年度的集体合同
    进行第一次群众性的检查。四月十八日“劳动报”特对这个问题发表社论，指出发动广大职工积极参加这一工作，是使检查充分发挥效果的重要关键，摘要如下：
    多年以来的经验证明，只有经济组织和工会组织经常关怀集体合同的履行，只有在已经建立了领导人和群众双方对履行合同的严密监督的地方，集体合同才具有巨大的力量。只有把自上而下和自下而上的检查结合起来，才能保证双方履行义务的高度效能。
    苏联人总结和检查自己的工作决不仅是为了看看成绩。检查执行情况首先是为了揭发缺点，对诚实的工作者提出建议，惩罚不愿改正错误的人员，力求实现已通过的决议。目前对集体合同的履行所进行的群众性检查，其主要任务也正是这样。
    群众性的检查，只有在它是被作为对企业工作的广泛的公众性的审查来进行时，只有在全体职工都参加这个工作时，才能发挥最大的效果。这里，对双方履行义务负有经常监督责任的职工会工厂委员会的常委会，自然必须首先积极参加这个工作。
    在全体大会上讨论工作总结是进行群众性检查的一个重要步骤。每次这样的会议都应当是对缺点进行勇敢和尖锐批评的一个广大讲台。经济和工会组织的领导人的责任，就是要为这件事建立一切必要的条件。必须坚决反对去年许多企业的那种做法：在中午休息时间草率地举行会议。此外，也应当防止毫无任何根据地用代表会议来代替全体大会的企图。工会和经济组织的领导人必须创立一切必要的条件，使每个职工都能畅所欲言，不顾情面地进行批评，并提出建议。群众的高度的严格要求，会迫使那些忘掉履行集体合同责任的人，那些慷慨地允诺、但却不去执行的人振奋起来。
    必须审慎地考虑和总结在职工会议上所提出的一切批评和建议，确定完成它们的期限和指定负责人。只有这样，检查才会有效果，才能促使集体合同的顺利执行。
