    World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Louis Saillant Answers Questions from Reporters

    Our reporter Zeng He, along with reporters from Worker's Daily, Guangming Daily, Tianjin Dagong Daily, Shanghai Wenhui Daily, and China Pictorial, posed questions to Louis Saillant, head of the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation and General Secretary of the WFTU, requesting answers. Saillant provided written responses to these questions. The questions and Saillant's responses are as follows:

    Q: Please share your impressions of your two visits to China and your thoughts on the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

    A: I spent a week in China. Actually, all of that time was spent in Beijing. During that time, I attended the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and visited the capital and the surrounding areas. Before visiting and studying the situation in other parts of China, my first impression was that China has made great progress compared to my visit in November and December of 1949.

    Everything I saw in Beijing made me feel that the whole of China is like a huge construction site, full of life and vitality. This manifestation of vitality reminds one of a buzzing beehive; this is my first impression. In the coming weeks, I will see, hear, and learn even more.

    Of course, I can already express my opinion on the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. I was deeply impressed by the nature of this congress. It was a well-organized, reasoned, and concrete congress. Great plans in preparation for great practice were carefully and meticulously studied. "Caution" is the guarantee of success, and "meticulousness" demonstrates the will of the congress delegates to complete useful work.

    The congress attached great importance to organizational issues, and this is correct. This is the best way to support and guarantee the correct direction given by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the life of Chinese trade unions.

    Through this congress, one can clearly see that the work undertaken by Chinese trade unions is the revolutionary and peaceful construction of a new China, already liberated from the monopoly capitalist system.

    From this congress, I can foresee China's enormous progress in economic and social terms. I have taken these facts as an important aid to our World Federation of Trade Unions, and of course, to the international workers' movement.

    Q: How should we evaluate the achievements already made in the struggle of workers around the world to defend peace under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions? In the current situation, how do you think workers in various countries should strengthen the struggle for peace?

    A: Everyone knows that the World Federation of Trade Unions, since its establishment, has concentrated its efforts on the struggle against those who create international wars.

    The main danger of international war is imperialism. The World Federation of Trade Unions is the vanguard of the people and the working class of all countries against imperialism. The whole world has already achieved many major achievements in this regard. These achievements have not been achieved solely by the working class, but the working class has played a decisive role in this struggle; the working class is the vanguard of the mass action of the worldwide movement to defend peace.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions has given support and assistance to the movement for national liberation and to the actions of the people of many countries to strive for national independence threatened by imperialism—especially American imperialism. Through this support and assistance, the World Federation of Trade Unions has guided the struggle of workers to defend peace in the right direction.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions fundamentally opposes the colonial system. We support the people of all countries who are fighting against the colonial and feudal systems. This can also be seen as an inevitable action of our international workers' movement in support of peace.

    Great achievements have already been made in this regard. The colonial system has been completely shaken. In imperialist and colonialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France, there are active people's movements and general public opinion against imperialist warmongering. These are milestones on the road that leads us to greater victories. Currently, in capitalist countries, the great unity of the people demanding an immediate "ceasefire" in Korea is flourishing under the impetus of the working class. In order to further strengthen this struggle to defend peace, we must expand mass activities, we must make our actions and struggles more deeply rooted among the people, and we must strengthen our trade union organizations and the movement of world peace defenders everywhere. This can only be achieved by putting forward clear slogans and working around these slogans. At present, the main one of these slogans is to demand that the five major powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, China, Britain, and France hold a meeting to discuss and conclude a peace treaty.

    Q: How do you think workers in Asia and Australia should actively prepare for the Third World Trade Union Congress?

    A: From large cities to rural villages, male and female manual and intellectual laborers in Asia and Australia are actively preparing for the Third World Trade Union Congress. They must master the "Appeal to the Working People of the World" issued by the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions on April 22nd of this year. This document must be read, posted, and widely publicized everywhere; it must be discussed and studied.

    The preparatory work for the Third World Trade Union Congress can only be done well by developing mass actions to strive for the realization of workers' urgent demands, national independence and peace.

    This preparatory work must not be carried out in a formal, bureaucratic manner. Good preparatory work is to link the preparatory work of the Third World Trade Union Congress with the daily life of the broad masses of the working people.

    It must be considered that the task of trade unions in this regard cannot merely entrust this work to a small number of limited trade union core members. The preparatory work for the Third World Trade Union Congress is a matter related to all workers. Each of them has his own responsibility in this preparatory work. The workers, who often fill international workers' life with vitality and give international workers' solidarity a concrete and positive content, if they think that the Third World Trade Union Congress is their own congress, then they will make the great international gathering held in Vienna in October 1953 a congress of male and female workers from all over the world.

    世界工联总书记路易·赛扬答记者问
    本报记者曾和工人日报、光明日报、天津大公报、上海文汇报和人民中国杂志社的记者向世界工会联合会代表团团长、世界工联总书记路易·赛扬提出一些问题，要求答复，赛扬对这些问题作了书面回答。这些问题和赛扬对这些问题的答复如下：
    问：请您谈一下两次来中国的感想及对中国工会第七次全国代表大会的感想。
    答：我在中国过了一个星期。实际上全部时间是在北京过的。在这些时间内，我参加了中国工会第七次全国代表大会，参观了首都和首都周围附近的地方。在参观和研究中国其他地方的情况之前，我的第一个印象是，与我在一九四九年十一月和十二月访华的时候相比，中国有了很大的进步。
    我在北京看到的一切，使我感到整个中国像一个巨大的建设工地，充满着生命与活力。这种生命力的表现使人想到一个发出嗡嗡声的蜂房，这是我的第一个印象。在以后几个星期中，我还要看到、听到和学到更多的东西。
    当然，我已经可以表示我对中国工会第七次全国代表大会的意见。给我很深印象的是这次代表大会的性质。这是一个井井有条的、道理分明的、具体的代表大会。为伟大的实践作准备的伟大计划都被谨慎、细致地研究，“谨慎”是成功的保证，“细致”说明了大会代表们要完成有用的工作的意志。
    这次代表大会十分重视组织方面的问题，这样做是对的。这是支持并保障中华全国总工会给中国工会生活指出的正确方向的最好办法。
    通过这次代表大会，人们可以明白看出，中国的工会所从事的工作，是在已经从垄断资本主义制度下解放出来的新中国的革命性的和平建设。
    从这次代表大会中，我可以预见中国在经济和社会方面的巨大进步。我已经把这些事实当作我们世界工会联合会，当然也就是国际工人运动的重要的援助。
    问：在世界工会联合会领导下，世界各国工人保卫和平的斗争已经取得的成绩应当怎样估计？您认为在目前的情况下，各国工人应如何加强争取和平的斗争。
    答：每个人都知道，世界工会联合会自从成立以来，一直集中力量进行反对制造国际战争的斗争。
    国际战争的主要危险是帝国主义。世界工会联合会是各国人民和工人阶级反对帝国主义的先锋。全世界在这方面已经获得了许多重大成就。这些成就的获得不是单靠工人阶级，但是在这个斗争中，工人阶级起了决定性的作用；工人阶级是世界规模的保卫和平运动的群众性行动的先锋。
    世界工联对于争取民族解放的运动，对于许多国家的人民争取受到帝国主义——特别是美帝国主义——威胁的民族独立的行动，给予了支持和援助，通过这些支持和援助，世界工联把工人保卫和平的斗争引导到正确的方向。
    世界工联从根本上反对殖民制度。我们支持对殖民制度和封建制度进行斗争的各国人民。这也可被看作我们国际工人拥护和平运动的一个必然行动。
    在这方面已经取得了很大的成就。殖民制度已全部动摇。在美、英、法这样的帝国主义和殖民主义国家中，有活跃的人民运动和一般反对帝国主义的战争挑拨行为的舆论，这些都是把我们引向更大胜利的道路上的里程碑。目前，在资本主义国家内，要求立即在朝鲜“停火”的人民大团结是由工人阶级的推动而蓬勃发展起来的。为了进一步加强这种保卫和平的斗争，必须扩大群众性的活动，必须使我们的行动和斗争更深入人民中间，必须在各地加强我们的工会组织和世界和平保卫者的运动。这只能在提出明确的口号并围绕着这口号做去，才可能达到目的。目前，这些口号中的主要的一个口号是要求苏、美、中、英、法五大国举行会议，讨论并缔结和平公约。
    问：你认为亚洲、澳洲各国工人应如何积极筹备世界工会第三次代表大会？
    答：亚洲和澳洲各国，从大城市一直到乡村，男女体力劳动者和脑力劳动者正在积极准备世界工会第三次代表大会。他们一定要掌握世界工联执行局在今年四月二十二日发出的告世界劳动人民书。这个文件必须要阅读、张贴、在各处广为宣传；必须对它加以讨论和研究。
    世界工会第三次代表大会的筹备工作只有在发展争取实现工人们的迫切要求、争取民族独立与和平的群众性的行动中才可以作好。
    这种筹备工作不能采取形式的、官僚主义的方式。良好的筹备工作是把世界工会第三次代表大会的筹备工作和劳动人民大众的日常生活联系起来的。
    必须考虑到，工会在这方面的任务不能仅仅把这个工作委托给数目很小的、有限的工会核心分子。世界工会第三次代表大会的筹备工作是和全体工人有关的一件事情。他们每个人在这次筹备工作中有他自己的责任。工人们，经常使国际工人生活充满生气，并使国际工人团结具备具体的和积极的内容的工人们，如果认为世界工会第三次代表大会是他们自己的代表大会，那末，他们将使一九五三年十月在维也纳召开的伟大国际集会成为全世界男女工人的代表大会。
