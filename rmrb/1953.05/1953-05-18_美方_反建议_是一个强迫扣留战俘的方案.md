Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th - Special Correspondent Report: When the U.S. negotiating representative Harrison presented the U.S. counterproposal, he sweetly said that the Korean-Chinese side's eight-point proposal of May 7th was "largely acceptable," and that "we have included the possibly adoptable parts of your proposal in the form of a draft on the scope of authority of the five-nation supervisory organization." Harrison even said that if the Korean-Chinese side's eight-point proposal and the U.S. "draft on the scope of authority of the five-nation supervisory organization" were compared, "it can be seen that there are many points of agreement between the two sides."

However, as long as the two plans are compared slightly, anyone can immediately see that, apart from formally agreeing to form a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with five neutral countries, the two plans are completely opposite in substance.

The Korean-Chinese side's eight-point proposal requires granting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the necessary powers to carry out its duties and responsibilities, so that the repatriation issue of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated can be resolved fairly and reasonably after explanations from relevant parties. The U.S. counterproposal seeks to paralyze this Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission so that it cannot perform its due duties, thereby enabling the U.S. to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

According to the Korean-Chinese plan, all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should be released from the military control of the detaining party at the detention site and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for reception and custody. According to the U.S. counterproposal, only Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated will be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. As for the Korean People's Army prisoners of war, who account for more than two-thirds of the total number of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, they will not be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but will be forcibly detained under the name of "on-the-spot release." This means that the responsibility of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission—to accommodate all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated—is greatly reduced.

According to the U.S. plan, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is actually under U.S. military control. Article 5 of the U.S. counterproposal stipulates that the U.S. troops will only withdraw two kilometers from the prisoner-of-war detention site. Article 6 of the U.S. counterproposal even openly admits that "the prisoner-of-war detention facility is actually under the military control of the detaining party." This situation actually places the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission under the threat of U.S. military encirclement, making it impossible to effectively perform its duties.

According to the Korean-Chinese plan, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should be composed of an equal number of representatives from each of the five neutral countries; each member state of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should be equipped with an equal number of armed forces. In order to ensure that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the power to perform its legitimate duties and responsibilities to control the prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction, these provisions are obviously completely necessary. However, the U.S. counterproposal stipulates that only one neutral country is allowed to be equipped with armed forces and staff, and other neutral countries can only send one representative, and its staff assistants cannot exceed ten people. The purpose of these restrictions is obviously to make the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission lack sufficient power to perform its due duties, so that the U.S. can have an excuse to influence or even interfere with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. counterproposal has actually put forward this very unreasonable request. Article 6 of the U.S. counterproposal stipulates that the neutral country that dispatches armed forces "has the right to request the detaining party to provide the necessary enforcement and security forces"; Article 16 further stipulates: "The custodial committee has the right to request the detaining party to provide certain unarmed personnel to carry out work, or to provide services within the prisoner-of-war facility under its military control." These provisions of the U.S., to put it bluntly, are an attempt to usurp the powers of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with its own armed forces and secret agents, in order to continue to threaten and intimidate prisoners of war, forcing them to remain afraid to go home.

According to the Korean-Chinese plan, after explanations, any prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated who request to return home should be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to quickly return to their country, and the U.S. should not make things difficult. However, the U.S. counterproposal stipulates that the U.S. should "manage and escort" them, which prepares the opportunity for the U.S. to make things difficult or forcibly detain them. This provision actually renders the role of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the explanations of relevant parties entirely in vain.

The Korean-Chinese side has proposed in the discussion of the eight-point plan that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should make decisions on all issues by majority vote, which is a completely reasonable and pragmatic solution that respects the status of neutral countries. However, the U.S. counterproposal requires the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to "work on a unanimous basis" except for procedural matters. This is actually to make it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to work, and to prevent any prisoner-of-war repatriation issue from being resolved. Because according to Article 10 of the U.S. counterproposal, any prisoner of war who requests repatriation must undergo such "verification" to an agency of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; Article 3 of the U.S. counterproposal also stipulates that both parties can send representatives to jointly study with the representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "to affirm that every person requesting to return to the other party is not forced to make such a decision." In this way, with the intervention of the U.S. representatives, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission may not be able to make a unanimous decision on every prisoner of war who requests repatriation, thus making the repatriation issue of any prisoner of war subject to endless debate, dragging on for sixty days, which is the explanation period stipulated in the U.S. counterproposal, and then these prisoners of war will be "released on the spot," that is, handed over to the Li Chengwan and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs.

The U.S. counterproposal has made so many restrictions on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and its purpose is to deprive it of the power to perform its legitimate duties and jurisdiction over prisoners of war, and to become a tool for covering up the U.S.'s forced detention of prisoners of war. This point is made even clearer by Harrison's continued wanton slander against certain neutral countries. General Nam Il pointed out at the 15th meeting that the basic spirit of the U.S. counterproposal is completely contrary to the Korean-Chinese eight-point proposal. General Nam Il said: "Your side claims to oppose obstructing repatriation by force, but your plan is precisely to achieve the purpose of obstructing repatriation by force." After General Nam Il exposed the essence of the U.S. counterproposal, Harrison, although still pretending to say outside the meeting that the Korean-Chinese side "misunderstood or deliberately distorted" his counterproposal, he had to overturn the sweet words he had said when he put forward the counterproposal, and agreed that his counterproposal and the Korean-Chinese plan were "completely contradictory." Harrison obviously also knew that the layer of sugar coating he had added to his counterproposal could no longer deceive anyone.

美方企图剥夺我方向战俘进行解释的权利
Title: The U.S. attempts to deprive us of the right to explain to prisoners of war

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th - Special Correspondent Report: The U.S. counterproposal is a plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This is not only reflected in the U.S.'s request to "release on the spot" Korean People's Army prisoners of war who account for more than two-thirds of all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated at the time of the armistice, and in the various restrictions on the powers of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but also in the U.S.'s refusal to allow the relevant party the freedom and convenience to explain to the prisoners of war under the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The Korean-Chinese side certainly believes that all Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated do not want to go home, but are concerned about returning home because they have been deceived and threatened by the U.S. Therefore, as long as they are freed from the control and influence of the U.S., and after the Korean-Chinese side explains to them, their doubts can be dispelled, and their repatriation issue can be resolved fairly and reasonably. It is precisely in order to prevent prisoners of war from being forcibly detained by the U.S. by force that the Korean-Chinese side, based on the principle agreed by both parties to hand over prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral custody, stipulated in the eight-point plan of May 7th that after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes custody of the prisoners of war, it should make arrangements so that the country to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to send people to explain to the prisoners of war, dispel their concerns, and notify the prisoners of war of any matters related to their return home, especially their complete right to return home and live a peaceful life. After explanation, all prisoners of war who request to be repatriated home should be assisted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to quickly return to their country, and the detaining party shall not make things difficult. The Korean-Chinese side believes that only in this way can the prisoners of war truly express their free will, and the realization of their free will can be guaranteed.

The U.S. counterproposal, however, attempts to make this explanation work unable to obtain due freedom and convenience, so that prisoners of war cannot dispel their doubts and express their true intentions. Article 8 of the U.S. counterproposal stipulates that the representatives of the relevant party to explain to their prisoners of war "can only send a maximum of one person for every thousand prisoners of war under the custody of the custodial committee." This provision is actually to deprive the Korean-Chinese side of the right to explain to prisoners of war, because it is obviously impossible to achieve the desired effect for one person to explain to a thousand prisoners of war with doubts; moreover, according to the U.S. counterproposal, U.S. troops are only two kilometers away from the detention site of these prisoners of war, and U.S. armed forces and secret agents can continue to control the prisoner-of-war camp in the name of "assistance" and "providing services." They can continue to exert pressure on prisoners of war in all aspects, so that the doubts of prisoners of war can never be eliminated. It is remembered that among the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, the U.S. has sent a large number of secret agents to impersonate prisoners of war to control them. The reason why the U.S. counterproposal stipulates that such a small number of people should be used to explain to so many prisoners of war is obviously to facilitate these secret agents to continue to control the prisoners of war, so that the prisoners of war cannot freely express their wishes. Moreover, even if some prisoners of war bravely break through the control of the U.S. secret agents and request to be repatriated home, his repatriation rights cannot be guaranteed. Because according to the provisions of the U.S. counterproposal, his request must also be "jointly studied" by representatives of both parties and representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to affirm that he "is not forced to make such a decision." If one of all the representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission expresses doubt, then this prisoner of war still cannot escape the fate of being forcibly detained.

Therefore, the explanation work cannot be carried out fully and effectively, coupled with the U.S.'s continued control and influence over prisoners of war, and the unreasonable restrictions on the repatriation rights of prisoners of war, the result is that this explanation work only becomes a formality, and in some cases, even this formality cannot be achieved. Harrison has actually revealed this point. He has requested to give prisoners of war the right to refuse to accept explanations, which shows that the U.S. is entirely possible to use those secret agents mixed among the prisoners of war to create so-called incidents of refusing to accept explanations, so that the explanation work cannot be carried out at all. In this way, the U.S. has an excuse to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and to legalize this illegal behavior.

In his letter to the Korean-Chinese side on April 16, Harrison suggested: "The neutral countries should give the relevant parties the opportunity to determine the attitude of the personnel under their custody towards their status." Now Harrison has crossed out what he said and attempted to limit this opportunity. General Nam Il has refuted the U.S. counterproposal thoroughly, so that Harrison had to abandon all disguise and openly admitted that the basic purpose of this counterproposal is completely opposite to the basic purpose of the Korean-Chinese eight-point plan. The whole world is now asking Harrison why he overturned the basis for resuming negotiations, overturned every word he said, and put forward such a completely unreasonable counterproposal. Harrison was unable to answer this question at the meeting table on the 16th. In order to avoid answering this question, Harrison requested a three-day recess. But if Harrison does not change his attitude, then three days later, he will still not be able to escape this question.

### 美方“反建议”是一个强迫扣留战俘的方案

    美方“反建议”是一个强迫扣留战俘的方案
    美方企图使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪
    【新华社开城十六日电】本社特派记者报道：美方谈判代表哈利逊在提出美方反建议时曾甜言蜜语地说，朝中方面五月七日的八点方案“大部分是可以接受的”，并且说，“我们以一个五国看管组织的职权范围草案的方式把你们的建议的可能采用的部分都包括进去了”。哈利逊甚至于说，只要把朝中方面的八点方案和美方的“关于五国看管组织的职权范围草案”比较一下，“那就可以看出双方意见一致的地方是很多的”。
    但是，只要把两种方案拿来略作比较，那末任何人都可以立刻看出，这两个方案除了在形式上都同意以五个中立国家组成中立国遣返委员会而外，实质上是完全相反的。
    朝中方面的八点方案要求给予中立国遣返委员会应有的职权，以便执行其职务和责任，从而使不直接遣返的战俘的遣返问题，经过有关方面解释以后，得到公正合理的解决。美方的反建议却要使这个中立国遣返委员会无法执行其应有的职权而陷于瘫痪，从而使美方得以强迫扣留战俘。
    根据朝中方面的方案，所有不直接遣返的战俘应该在拘留地点从拘留一方的军事控制下释放出来，交给中立国遣返委员会接收和看管。根据美方的反建议，只有不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员才交给中立国遣返委员会。至于占不直接遣返战俘总数三分之二以上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员则不交给中立国遣返委员会，而在“就地释放”的名义下加以强迫扣留。这就是说，中立国遣返委员会的职责——收容全部不直接遣返的战俘——被大大削减了。
    根据美方方案，中立国遣返委员会实际上处于美方的军事控制之下。美方反建议的第五款规定，美方军队只撤离战俘居留地点两公里。美方在反建议的第六款中甚至公开承认，“战俘看管处所实际上处于拘留一方军事控制之下”。这种形势实际上就是使中立国遣返委员会处于美方军事包围的威胁之下，根本无法有效执行它的职务。
    根据朝中方面的方案，中立国遣返委员会应由五个中立国家各派同等数目的代表组成；中立国遣返委员会的各成员国应该各自配备同等数量的武装力量。为了保证中立国遣返委员会具有执行其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下的战俘的权力，这些规定显然是完全必要的。但是美方的反建议却规定，只许一个中立国家配备武装力量和工作人员，其他各中立国家只能派遣一名代表，而且其参谋助理人员最多不能超过十人。这些限制的目的，显然就是为了使中立国遣返委员会没有足够的力量执行它应有的职权，使美方能够有借口来影响以至干预中立国遣返委员会的工作。美方的反建议中实际上也已经提出了这种十分无理的要求。在美方反建议的第六款中规定，派遣武装力量的中立国“有权要求拘留一方供给必要的执行和保安部队”；第十六款更规定：“看管委员会有权要求拘留一方提供一定的非武装人员以进行工作，或在其军事管制下的地区内看管战俘的处所之内提供服务。”美方这些规定，拆穿来说，就是企图用自己的武装力量和特务人员篡夺中立国遣返委员会的职权，以便继续威胁恐吓战俘，迫使他们仍然不敢回家。
    根据朝中方面的方案，不直接遣返的战俘在经过解释以后，凡是提出要求遣返回家的，应该由中立国遣返委员会负责协助他们迅速返回祖国，美方不得留难。但是美方的反建议却规定由美方来“管理和护送”他们，这就为美方准备了留难或强迫扣留他们的机会。这个规定实际上是要使中立国遣返委员会的作用和有关方面的解释工作全部成为白费。
    朝中方面在八点方案的讨论过程中已经提出，中立国遣返委员会对一切问题应该采取多数决定，这是尊重中立国的地位的完全合理的、实事求是的解决办法。但是美方的反建议却要求除了程序事项外，中立国遣返委员会要“在一致的基础上进行工作”。这实际上是要使中立国遣返委员会无法进行工作，使任何一个战俘的遣返问题都得不到解决。因为根据美方反建议第十款的规定，任何战俘如果要求遣返，就得向中立国遣返委员会的一个机构进行这样的“证实”；美方反建议的第三款又规定，双方可以派出代表与中立国遣返委员会的代表共同研究，“以肯定每一个要求返回对方的人员都不是被迫作出这样的决定的”。这样，在美方派遣代表出面干预之下，对于每一个要求遣返的战俘，中立国遣返委员会都可能无法作出一致的决定，因而使任何一个战俘的遣返问题都可以无休止地争论下去，拖过六十天，即美方反建议中所规定的解释期限，就要把这些战俘“就地释放”，也就是把他们交给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮。
    美方的反建议对中立国遣返委员会作了这么多的限制，其目的是要使它丧失执行合法职务和管辖战俘的权力，而成为掩护美方强迫扣留战俘的工具。这一点，由于哈利逊继续对某些中立国家肆意诬蔑而显得更清楚了。南日大将在十五日会议上指出，美方的反建议和朝中方面八点方案的基本精神是完全相反的。南日大将说：“你方口口声声自称反对用武力阻挠遣返，但你方方案却正是要实现武力阻挠遣返的目的。”在南日大将揭露了美方反建议的实质之后，哈利逊在会外虽然还假惺惺地说朝中方面“误解了或故意歪曲了”他的反建议，可是他又不得不推翻他在提出反建议时说过的那些甜言蜜语，同意他的反建议和朝中方面的方案是“完全矛盾的”。哈利逊显然也知道，他给他的反建议加上的一层糖衣，已经骗不了任何人了。
    美方企图剥夺我方向战俘进行解释的权利
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者报道：美方的反建议是一个强迫扣留战俘的方案，这一点，除了表现在美方要求将占全部不直接遣返的战俘三分之二以上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员在停战时“就地释放”，以及对中立国遣返委员会的职权所作的种种限制以外，还表现在美方不许有关一方对中立国遣返委员会收管下的战俘有进行解释的自由与便利。
    朝中方面肯定认为：所有不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，绝不是不愿回家，而是因为受了美方的欺骗和威胁，对回家存有顾虑。因此，只要他们摆脱了美方的控制和影响，经过朝中方面对他们进行解释，他们的疑惧心理就可以消失，而他们的遣返问题也就可以得到公正合理的解决。正是为了使战俘不致被美方用武力强迫扣留，朝中方面根据双方同意的将不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国收管的原则，在五月七日的八点方案中规定：中立国遣返委员会在收管战俘之后，应该就进行安排，使战俘所属的国家有自由和便利派人向战俘进行解释，消除他们的顾虑，并通知战俘任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全权利。经过解释之后，凡是要求遣返回家的一切战俘，应由中立国遣返委员会协助他们迅速返回祖国，拘留一方不得留难。朝中方面认为，只有这样，才能保证战俘真正表达他们的自由意志，并且使他们的自由意志的实现得到保障。
    美方的反建议却企图使这种解释工作得不到应有的自由与便利，从而使战俘不能消除疑惧心理而表达他们真正的意愿。美方反建议的第八款规定，有关一方向他们的被俘人员进行解释工作的代表，“在看管委员会所看管的每一千名战俘中，最多只能派一名”。这个规定实际上是要剥夺朝中方面向战俘进行解释的权利，因为以一个人去向一千名心怀疑惧的战俘进行解释，显然不能收到应有的效果；何况，根据美方的反建议，美国军队离开这些战俘拘留的地点只有两公里，美方的武装部队和特务人员还可以用“协助”和“提供服务”的名义继续控制战俘营场，他们可以继续对战俘施行各方面的压力，使战俘的疑惧心理始终无法消除。人们记得，在不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员中间，美方曾经派遣了大批特务分子冒充战俘混在里面进行控制。美方反建议之所以规定用这样少的人去对这样多的战俘进行解释工作，显然是为了便于让这些特务分子继续控制战俘，使战俘不能自由表达自己的意愿。而且，即使有些战俘勇敢地冲破美方特务分子的控制，要求遣返回家，他的遣返权利也并不能得到保障。因为根据美方反建议的规定，他的要求还要经过双方代表和中立国遣返委员会代表的“共同研究”，以肯定他“不是被迫作出这样的决定的”。如果中立国遣返委员会的所有代表中有一个人表示怀疑，那么这个战俘还是逃脱不了被强迫扣留的命运。
    因此，解释工作不能充分而有效地进行，再加上美方对战俘继续保持控制和影响，以及对战俘遣返权利的无理限制，其结果就使得这种解释工作仅仅成为一种形式，而在某些场合下，甚至连这种形式也做不到。哈利逊实际上已经透露了这一点。他曾经要求给予战俘拒绝接受解释的权利，这就说明美方完全有可能利用那些混在战俘中间的特务分子制造所谓拒绝接受解释的事件，使解释工作根本无法进行。这样，美方就有了强迫扣留战俘的借口，并且使这种非法行为成为合法化。
    哈利逊在他四月十六日给朝中方面的信中，曾经建议：“中立国给予有关各方以机会，来确定在其收容下的人员对于他们的地位的态度。”现在哈利逊又将自己说过的话一笔勾销，企图限制这种机会了。南日大将已经将美方的反建议驳得体无完肤，以致哈利逊不得不抛掉一切伪装，公开承认这个反建议的基本目的是和朝中方面八点方案的基本目的完全相反的。全世界现在要问哈利逊，他为什么推翻恢复谈判的基础，推翻他自己说过的每一句话，而提出这样一个完全不合理的反建议来。哈利逊在十六日的会议桌上没有能够回答这个问题。为了逃避回答这个问题，哈利逊要求休会三天。但是如果哈利逊不改变他的态度，那末三天之后，他还是逃避不了这个问题的。
