    A Salesperson Actively Serving Customer Needs
    By our reporter, Fu Dong
    Cannot let fellow villagers buy "heartbreak goods"
    Li Shuzhen, a representative from the Northeast Delegation to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, is a salesperson at the First Sales Department of the Fujin County Department Store in Songjiang Province. In the town of Fujin County, which has a population of 50,000, the story of Li Shuzhen patiently and enthusiastically serving customers is widely circulated. However, a director of a district cooperative in the county did not believe it. One day, with the intention of testing her, he went to the First Sales Department of the county department store to pretend to buy shoes and asked Li Shuzhen to choose for him. He tried on pair after pair, trying leather shoes, cloth shoes, and rubber shoes. He said this pair wasn't suitable, and that pair was too expensive. Li Shuzhen patiently selected for him without any annoyance, and explained the quality and price of the shoes in detail. This convinced the district cooperative director, and he finally bought a pair of cloth shoes. After returning to the cooperative, he immediately called on the cadres of the cooperative to learn from Li Shuzhen's spirit of serving customers.
    Li Shuzhen often encourages the department store's salespeople to treat customers as if they were their own relatives. She said: "I often think of the scene when I was a child and went to town with my father to buy things. From the age of twelve, I worked with my father in the landlord's fields. After a year of hard work, we didn't earn much money. Later, we finally saved some money, and my father led me twenty *li* to town to buy a shirt. Who knew that the people in the store would ignore me. After standing for a long time, the shopkeeper finally took out a shirt, and there was a large dirty patch on it. We didn't dare to say anything, paid the money, and left. Back home, the whole family was unhappy for several days. Now, when I stand in front of the counter and choose goods for my fellow villagers, I say to myself, the money of the fellow villagers doesn't come easily, I can't let them buy 'heartbreak goods!'"
    Seize every opportunity to understand customer needs
    One day, a fellow villager came to buy a uniform. Li Shuzhen took out a plain weave blue uniform for him. The fellow villager shook his head and asked, "Do you have twill?" He continued, "The harvest in the fields is getting better year by year, and people in the countryside are paying more and more attention to clothing year by year. Few people like to wear plain weave clothes!" The fellow villager also made suggestions on the style and color of the uniform. Li Shuzhen seized this opportunity to ask him, "Do most fellow villagers want to buy cloth to make their own clothes? Or do they want to buy ready-made clothes?" The fellow villager said that after liberation, many rural women participated in field labor and did not have time to do needlework; moreover, buying ready-made clothes was more cost-effective than making their own. Li Shuzhen also asked the fellow villagers what goods they wanted to buy, what kind of style they liked, and what kind of color, and recorded the fellow villagers' replies in the counter register. In the evening, Li Shuzhen reported the situation to the business section. The business section then processed a batch of uniforms according to the fellow villager's suggestions, and these uniforms sold very well.
    Li Shuzhen deeply realized in her work that only with enthusiasm and understanding of consumers' needs can she strengthen the planning of work, improve business management, and lay a solid foundation for the implementation of economic accounting. Therefore, every day when she sells goods to workers, peasants, cadres, students, and women, she seizes every opportunity to understand their needs for goods. When her relatives come to town for errands, she finds out even more carefully: asking them how much grain they harvest a year, how much sideline production they engage in, how much surplus money they have to buy things besides eating, what the fellow villagers want to buy, and so on. When she took a vacation during the Spring Festival to return to her hometown, she also used the opportunity to visit acquaintances to conduct surveys and research. She is a people's representative of Fujin County. When she attended the county people's congress, she took down all the percentages of increased purchasing power of farmers and the income figures of farmers engaged in sideline production mentioned by the responsible comrades in their reports as a reference for the department store to make plans. She often goes to the agricultural section of the county people's government to understand the situation. When farmers go to the forest area to cut wood in winter, she has already investigated the number of people going, what they will buy, how much their monthly wages are, and how much surplus money they estimate to have after completion... Based on these materials, she prepares goods for them one after another. She also frequently goes to factories, government offices, and schools to understand the quantity, quality, and specifications of goods needed by workers and students every month and every season. She even knows clearly when each unit selects models; she sometimes helps them formulate award plans and supplies prizes according to the plans.
    Turning "cold goods" into "hot goods"
    In the past, there was a batch of white bed sheets on the store's shelves. These bed sheets were too small to be used as bed sheets, and too large to be used as mattress covers, so no one bought them. Li Shuzhen mobilized everyone to use their brains and think of ways, and she also pondered over it carefully. They finally came up with a solution: cut these bed sheets into eight pillow pads and four baggage wraps. They cut the cloth and drew silk floss in their spare time. The pillow pads made in this way sold for only 8,500 *yuan* each, which was better-looking than the pillow pads sold by the company for 17,000 *yuan* each. They were sold out in less than four days. Few people were interested in the children's blankets in the company. Occasionally someone would ask, but upon hearing that they cost 57,000 *yuan* each, they would no longer ask. What to do? Li Shuzhen pondered over this day and night, and suddenly thought that people needed scarves in the cold weather. Cutting the blankets would make just enough for two scarves. As a result, the scarves sold very quickly.
    Finding different sales targets for different commodities
    Li Shuzhen often goes to the warehouse to understand the inventory situation and find different sales targets for different commodities. This not only promoted the sales of goods but also met the needs of customers. Once, she saw that a batch of high-grade blankets, embroidered quilt covers, and leather jackets were overstocked in the warehouse. She thought that those Soviet friends might need these things, could she ask them? However, she herself did not speak Russian, how could she explain the meaning? Later, she learned that an old man named Yao spoke Russian, so she asked Old Man Yao to translate. But Old Man Yao was unwilling. Li Shuzhen did not give up and repeatedly requested him. Finally, Old Man Yao was very touched and said, "You girl are really serving the people, I will definitely translate it well for you." The first time she and Old Man Yao went to those Soviet friends, they sold twenty high-grade blankets, five bundles of 200,000 *yuan* per meter of serge, seven leather jackets, and several embroidered quilts. Since then, these Soviet friends often come to the company to buy things.
    Strive to learn and improve a step
    Some comrades in the department store are not at ease in their work. They say: "Making sales is not promising, it is better to engage in industrial construction." Li Shuzhen does not think so. She believes that our store is the people's store, the people's business. The goods produced in the factory have to be delivered to the people through the hands of the salesperson. If the state-owned store can sell the goods faster, our factory can produce more goods. Isn't this also serving economic construction! If state-owned stores expand their sales revenue, reduce expenses, and complete the profit delivery plan, isn't this also accumulating funds for national economic construction! If state-owned commerce leads the market well and continues to stabilize prices, isn't this also an important condition for the smooth progress of national economic construction! More importantly, isn't the purpose of national construction also to guarantee the needs of the people! Therefore, we must strive to learn, improve our business, and especially comprehensively implement the economic accounting system and complete the commodity circulation plan and the financial plan. Li Shuzhen said: They are far from enough in this regard! She proposed to learn from the advanced experience of the Liu Shuzhen team of the Second Department Store of Shenyang Department Store, to learn from the advanced experience of all state-owned stores, to better serve national economic construction, and to serve the needs of customers.

    一个积极为顾客需要服务的营业员
    本报记者　傅冬
    不能叫老乡买“伤心货”
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会的东北代表团里，有一个代表名叫李淑珍，她是松江省富锦县百货公司第一门市部的营业员。在有五万人口的富锦县城里，李淑珍耐心地热情地为顾客服务的事迹，被人们传颂着。但县里有一个区合作社主任不相信，有一天，他抱着试探一下的心情，到县百货公司第一门市部去假装买鞋，并且请李淑珍给他挑。他试了一双又一双，试了皮鞋，又试布鞋、胶鞋，试了这双说不合适，试了那双又嫌太贵。李淑珍一点也不嫌麻烦地替他挑选，还详细地给他解说鞋的质量、价格。这一下把那个区合作社主任说得心服口服，最后只好买了一双布鞋。他回到合作社以后，马上就号召该社的干部学习李淑珍为顾客服务的精神。
    李淑珍常常鼓励公司的营业员们，要像对待自己的亲人一样地对待顾客。她说：“我常常想起我小时候和父亲一块儿进城买东西的情景。我从十二岁起，就和父亲一起在地主的地里干活。辛苦一年，也捞不下几个钱。后来好容易存了点钱，父亲领着我跑了二十里路，进城去买衬衣。那晓得商店里的人不理我。站了很久，掌柜的才给拿出一件衬衣，上面还有一大块是脏的。我们不敢啃声，给了钱就出来了。回到家里，一家人好几天都不高兴。现在我站在柜台前给老乡挑货时，就对自己说，老乡的钱来得不容易，不能叫老乡买‘伤心货！’”
    抓紧一切机会，了解顾客需要
    有一天，一个老乡来买制服。李淑珍把平纹布的蓝色制服拿给他。那老乡摇摇头问：“有斜纹的吗？”他接着说：“地里的收成一年比一年好，乡里人穿衣裳一年比一年讲究，平纹布的衣裳已没多少人爱穿了！”那老乡对制服的式样和颜色也提了意见。李淑珍抓紧这机会问他：“一般老乡愿意买布自己作衣裳？还是愿意买现成的？”老乡说，解放以后，许多农村妇女都参加了地里的劳动，没时间作针线活；而且买现成衣裳比自己作的还合算。李淑珍又问老乡们都想买什么货，喜欢那种样子，那种颜色，并且把老乡答复的话记到柜台登记簿上。晚上李淑珍把情况反映给业务股。业务股就按这位老乡的意见加工了一批制服，这些制服很好销。
    李淑珍在工作中深深地体会到，只有热情而不了解消费者的需要，就不可能加强工作的计划性和改进经营管理，也不可能给实行经济核算制打下有力的基础。所以她每天卖货给职工、农民、干部、学生和妇女时，总要抓紧一切机会，了解她们对商品的需要。碰到她的亲戚有事进城，她了解得更仔细了：问他们一年打多少粮食，搞多少副业生产，除了吃饭，能有多少余钱买东西，老乡们都想买点什么，等等。春节放假回乡休息时，她也利用到熟人家串门的机会，进行调查研究。她是富锦县的人民代表，当她出席该县人民代表会时，负责同志在报告中提到农民购买力提高的百分比和农民搞副业生产的收入数字等，她都统统记了下来，作为百货公司订计划的参考。她经常到县人民政府农业科去了解情况。当农民冬天到林区去砍伐木材以前，她已把去的人数，他们买什么东西，每月的工资有多少，完工后估计有多少余钱买东西……调查好了；根据这些材料，陆续给他们准备货物。她还经常到工厂、机关、学校去了解职工、学生每月每季需要的商品的数量、质量和规格。她连每个单位什么时候评选模范都知道得清清楚楚；她有时帮他们订评奖计划，并且按照计划供应奖品。
    把“冷货”加工成“热货”
    公司的货架子上，以前放着一批白色的被单。这种被单作被单嫌小，作褥单又大，因此没人买。李淑珍发动大家动脑筋，想办法，自己也用心捉摸。他们最后想出了办法：把这种被单剪成八个枕头垫、四个包袱皮。他们把布剪开，在业余的时间抽丝挑花。这样作出来的枕头垫只卖八千五百元一个，比公司卖一万七千元一个的枕头垫还好看。没四天，就卖光了。公司里的小孩毛毯，也很少有人过问，偶尔有人来问，一听要五万七千元一条，就不再问下去了。怎么办呢？李淑珍日夜为此盘算，忽然想到在大冷天，人们正需要围巾，把毛毯剪开，刚好能作两条围巾。这样，围巾卖的非常快。
    不同的商品找不同的销售对象
    李淑珍经常到仓库了解库存情况，替不同的商品，找不同的销售对象。这样既推销了货物，又满足了顾客的需要。有一次，她看到仓库里积压着一批高级毛毯子、绣花被面和皮夹克。她想，常见的那些苏联友人可能需要这些东西，是否可以问问他们呢？可是，她自己不会讲俄语，如何能把意思说明呢？后来她了解到有个姓姚的老头会俄语，就请姚老头作了翻译。但姚老头不愿意。李淑珍不灰心，一次又一次地请求他，最后，姚老头很受感动地说：“你这姑娘真是为人民服务，我一定给你翻译好。”她和姚老头第一次去找那些苏联友人，就推销了二十床高级毛毯、五捆二十万元一公尺的哔叽、七件皮夹克、好几床绣花被。以后，这些苏联友人就常到公司里来买东西了。
    努力学习提高一步
    百货公司有些同志不安心工作，他们说：“作买卖没出息，不如搞工业建设好。”李淑珍可不是这样想。她认为：我们的商店是人民的商店，是人民的买卖。工厂里生产出来的商品，要经过营业员的手送到人民的手里，如果国营商店能把商品快一点卖出去，我们的工厂里就可以多生产一些商品，这不也是为经济建设服务吗！国营商店扩大卖钱额，降低费用，完成利润上缴计划，这不也是为国家经济建设积累资金吗！国营商业把市场领导好，继续稳定物价，这不也是使国家的经济建设能以顺利进行的重要条件吗！更重要的，国家建设的目的，不也是保证人民的需要吗！因此，必须努力学习，提高业务，特别是要全面地贯彻经济核算制，完成商品流转计划和财务计划。李淑珍说：在这方面他们还差得远哩！她提出要学习沈阳百货公司第二商店刘淑珍小组的先进经验，要学习所有的国营商店的先进经验，更好地为国家经济建设服务，为满足顾客的需要服务。
