The Liu Changfu Group and the Volunteer Army
　　Kim Pong

A Letter from the Korean Front

　　On January 13, 1952, a letter from the Korean front arrived at Liu Changfu's hand in the Tianjin Steel Plant. The envelope was made of old newspaper. The workers in the group rushed up to read it as soon as they heard it was a letter from Korea. Liu Changfu held the letter high and said, "Comrades, you don't need to read the letter, just look at this envelope and you'll know how difficult our Volunteer Army is!" The group fell silent and listened attentively as Cheng Zhenyu read the letter to everyone.

　　"Dear Comrades of the Liu Changfu Group: You are producing day and night in the factory, using a lot of brains, spending a lot of energy, and shedding a lot of sweat to create a lot of wealth for the country to support us. We deeply thank you.

　　We are soldiers guarding the 38th parallel—the front line of defending peace. We express to you that we must not be afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice in battle, not be afraid of ice and snow and difficulties, strive to kill more enemies, capture more prisoners, strive for greater honor, and strive for merit upon merit.

　　Comrades, we swear: In order to defend the newborn motherland, we are determined to dedicate everything we have so that the motherland can smoothly carry out construction and our worker comrades can always produce in a peaceful environment for the prosperity of the motherland and the happiness of the people of the motherland.

　　The entire meritorious representatives of a certain machine gun company of the Volunteer Army, Xie Changshou, etc."

　　Hearing this, the group was moved by this letter full of combat friendship. Liu Changfu saw the group's emotions and immediately organized everyone to discuss: "How to reply to the Volunteer Army?"

　　The Liu Changfu Group's Reply

　　"Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

　　We feel like we have seen our loved ones when we received your letter. Comrades, you are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, and the people we admire and love the most. Only because you are defending the motherland on the front line can we safely produce in the rear.

　　Our group responded to Chairman Mao's great call to 'increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army' and set a production plan. In 1952, we will increase production and practice thrift by 7 billion yuan.

　　Dear comrades, we also express to you: On the production front, we are not afraid of hardship and not afraid of sweating. Under hundreds of degrees of high temperature, every comrade will work as vigorously as charging and killing enemies on the front line. We have confidence that we will be able to complete our production increase and thrift plan to support you and build our great motherland."

　　A Gift of Thirteen Fighter Planes

　　The working class keeps its word.

　　At first, the steel bars produced by the finishing mill of the steel rolling plant always "ran heads," which damaged the steel bars and delayed production. Liu Changfu proposed that everyone think of ways to improve it, but everyone said, "Eating doesn't mean you don't drop grains, and rolling steel doesn't mean you don't run heads! This work is not easy, it's been like this since the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang were here." But Liu Changfu said to everyone: "If your thoughts are concentrated, you won't run heads. For example, when the Volunteer Army goes to the front line, can they let the enemy go? Our steel rolling plant is the battlefield, and the pliers are the submachine guns. Running a head is letting an American devil go." In this way, under Liu Changfu's mobilization, through everyone's joint efforts, the scrap rate gradually decreased from 10 percent to 0.5 percent.

　　In 1952, their original target for increasing production and practicing thrift was 7 billion yuan, but inspired by the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army, they found many tricks and tapped potential, and achieved great results in half a year. By July, they revised the plan and raised the annual production increase and thrift target to 17.3 billion yuan. But by the end of the year, they had overfulfilled their plan, increasing production and saving a total of 19.3 billion yuan, which was almost enough to buy thirteen jet fighters. This is the glorious action of the Liu Changfu Group in fulfilling its promise to support the Volunteer Army.

　　Their relationship with the Volunteer Army became closer and closer, and their feelings became deeper and deeper. In this year, the Volunteer Army sent them more than 30 letters, describing the battles and life on the front line. They also kept writing back, reporting the new achievements of the group in production. For more than a year, almost every time the Volunteer Army won a victory on the front line, their group created a new record. The Volunteer Army's battles were victories after victories, and the Liu Changfu Group's production also improved again and again, continuously overfulfilling the state's production tasks and group plans.

　　Huang Jiguang Lives Here

　　Since 1950, they have established a system of reading the newspaper for half an hour every day. After the Volunteer Army went abroad to fight, they became more concerned about the newspaper. Every day, they could hear about the victories on the front line and the achievements of the country's construction from the newspaper. One day, they read the news in the newspaper that Volunteer Army soldier Huang Jiguang had sacrificed. The people in the group suddenly fell silent, and several people shed tears. When it was time for dinner, everyone still didn't move. Finally, Wei Guohe stood up and said, "Comrades, Huang Jiguang is not dead, he will always live here," he pointed to his heart, he wanted to say more, but he couldn't continue, he choked up.

　　The next day, everyone went to work early without prior consultation, and checked the machines with special care. When the power was turned on, the spirit of martyr Huang Jiguang was active throughout the workshop. The workers of the Liu Changfu Group carried out production with the will to avenge and the determination to create new records. Sure enough, the output that day broke the group's previous highest record.

　　Once, young worker Wu Yupu broke an iron bar, he hugged his head and squatted on the ground crying. The foreman on duty comforted him, and he said, "How can I be worthy of Comrade Huang Jiguang." Another time, when it was time to hand over the shift, the furnace door of the steel heating furnace fell down. No one could get near the furnace opening with a temperature of 1,300 degrees. Fan Shanchuan, a rough steel worker, frowned, ran over silently, and carried a piece of iron plate to block the furnace opening so that everyone could hang the furnace door up. At this time, Fan Shanchuan's eyebrows were burned off, his hair was scorched, and his clothes were also scorched. Someone asked him, "It's not your task, why did you run over there automatically?" Fan Shanchuan's answer was: "Didn't Huang Jiguang automatically sacrifice himself to block the gun muzzle? We are far behind Huang Jiguang."

　　Advancing Shoulder to Shoulder with the Volunteer Army

　　The Volunteer Army has become a huge source of strength for them to draw strength from and overcome all difficulties. This year, they moved to the newly built semi-automated steel rolling plant, and their group helped install the machines. The weather was cold, the wind was strong, and the snow was heavy. The new factory building had not yet been fitted with glass, and there was an inch of snow on the ground. They had to dig frozen soil piles to pad the foundation. Someone said, "How can we work in such heavy snow?" Sun Jingyun of the Liu Changfu Group said to everyone: "Isn't it snowing heavily on the Korean battlefield now? The Volunteer Army will never say that they won't fight if it snows, right? They fight even more beautifully! Comrades, follow me!" Saying that, he threw off his cotton robe and took the lead. As a result, five days of work were completed in one and a half days. The flue of the steel heating furnace was covered with more than a foot of ice. To dig it down, they had to drill into the cold flue and kneel on the ice to dig. At this time, some people hesitated again. Sun Jingyun again told everyone about the hardships of how the Volunteer Army transport team completed the transport task by traversing mountains and ridges in the icy and snowy weather. "What is this little difficulty for us!" Saying that, he plunged into the flue, and several young lads followed him in. Three days of work were completed in one day. When the car was being tested, Yu Baocai was soaked in water, and some parts froze immediately, but he still insisted on driving. Someone advised him to rest for a while, and he said, "This is nothing for the country's industrialization, it's still a world apart from the Volunteer Army."

　　On April 3, they saw the Volunteer Army's spring battle achievements in the newspaper again. They wrote to the Volunteer Army to congratulate them and reported the situation of their move to the newly built steel rolling plant. On April 12, they officially started production, and on the 21st, they created a new record for daily output.

　　In the cause of defending the motherland and building the motherland, they are advancing shoulder to shoulder with the Volunteer Army!

    刘长福小组和志愿军
  　金凤
    朝鲜前线的来信
    一九五二年一月十三日，一封寄自朝鲜前线的信，送到天津钢厂刘长福的手里。信封是用旧报纸糊成的。小组的工人一听说是朝鲜来的信，立刻涌了上来争着要看。刘长福把信高高地举起，说道：“同志们，不用看信，光看这个信封，就知道咱们志愿军是多么艰苦！”小组的人静了下来，凝神静听着程震宇给大家念信。
    “亲爱的刘长福小组全体工人同志们：你们在工厂里日夜生产，用了很多脑筋，费了许多精神，流了许多汗，为国家创造了许多财富来支援我们，我们深深感谢你们。
    我们是守卫在三八线——保卫和平第一线的战士。我们向你们表示：要在战斗中不怕流血和牺牲，不怕冰雪和困难，争取多杀敌人，多捉俘虏，争取更大的荣誉，争取功上加功。
    同志们，我们宣誓：为了保卫新生的祖国，我们决心献出我们的一切，让祖国能顺利地进行建设，让我们的工人同志能永远在和平环境中为祖国的富强、为祖国人民的幸福而生产。
    志愿军某部机枪连全体功臣代表谢长寿等”
    听到这里，小组的人都为这封充满着战斗友情的信所激动。刘长福看到了小组的情绪，马上组织大家讨论：“怎样来回答志愿军？”
      刘长福小组的回信
    “亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志：
    我们见到了你们的来信，就同见了亲人一样。同志们，你们是祖国最优秀的儿女，是我们最敬佩的最亲爱的人。只因有你们在前线保卫着祖国，我们在后方才能够安心生产。
    我们小组响应了毛主席‘增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军’的伟大号召，订下了生产计划。一九五二年我们要增产节约七十亿元。
    亲爱的同志们，我们也向你们表示：在生产战线上，我们也不怕吃苦，不怕流汗。在数百度高温下，我们每个同志干起活来，也要像在前线冲锋杀敌一样地起劲。我们有信心，一定能够完成我们的增产节约计划，来支援你们，来建设咱们伟大的祖国。”
      十三架战斗机的献礼
    工人阶级是说到做到的。
    最初轧钢厂精轧机出的钢条老是“跑头”，坏了钢条，又误了生产。刘长福提出来要大家想办法改进，大伙还说：“吃饭那有不掉粒的，轧钢那有不跑头的！干这活不易，从日本鬼子、国民党在这里的时候起就是这样。”但刘长福对大家说：“如果思想集中，就不会跑头。譬如志愿军上前线，还能放走敌人？咱们轧钢厂就是战场，钳子就是冲锋枪，跑一个头，就是放走一个美国鬼子。”就这样，在刘长福的动员下，经过大家的共同努力，废品率果然逐渐从百分之十降低到百分之零点五。
    一九五二年，他们原订增产节约目标是七十亿元，但在志愿军英雄事迹的鼓舞下，找到了许多窍门，挖掘了潜力，半年中得到很大的成绩。到七月间，他们修订了计划，把全年增产节约目标提高到一百七十三亿元。但到了年底，他们又超额完成了他们的计划，共增产节约一百九十三亿元，差不多能购买十三架喷气式战斗机。这就是刘长福小组实践支援志愿军诺言的光辉行动。
    他们和志愿军的关系愈来愈密切，感情也就愈来愈深了。在这一年中，志愿军给他们来了三十多封信，叙述前线的战斗和生活。他们也不断回信，报告小组生产上的新成就。一年多来，差不多志愿军在前线每打一次胜仗，他们小组就创造一次新纪录。志愿军的战斗是胜利接胜利，刘长福小组的生产也就提高再提高，不断地超额完成国家生产任务和小组计划。
      黄继光活在这里
    从一九五○年起，他们就建立了每天读报半小时的制度，志愿军出国作战以后，他们对报纸就更关心了。他们每天都能从报纸上听到前线战斗的胜利和祖国建设的成就。一天，他们从报纸上读到志愿军战士黄继光牺牲的消息，小组的人顿时沉默下来，好几个人掉了泪，开饭了，大家还是没有动。最后，魏国和站起来说：“同志们，黄继光没有死，他永远活在这里”，他指指自己的心，他还想说，可是再也说不下去，他哽咽住了。
    第二天，每个人都不约而同地提早上班，把机器检查得特别仔细。当马力开动的时候，黄继光烈士的精神，活跃在整个车间。刘长福小组的工人个个都带着复仇的意志，带着创造新纪录的决心进行生产。果然，这一天的产量打破了小组过去的最高纪录。
    一次，青年工人吴玉璞弄坏了一根铁，他抱着头蹲在地上流泪。值班工长劝慰他，他说：“我怎么对得起黄继光同志。”又一次，到交班的时候了，烘钢炉的炉门掉了下来，一千三百度高温的炉门口，谁也近它不得。粗轧钢工范山川眉头皱了一下，一声不响地跑过去，扛了一块铁板把炉门口挡住，大家才把炉门挂上。这时候，范山川的眉毛烧掉了，头发烧焦了，衣服也烤糊了。有人问他：“又不是你的任务，为什么你自动跑过去？”范山川的回答是：“难道黄继光不是自动舍身扑到枪眼上去的吗？我们比黄继光还差得远哩。”
      与志愿军并肩前进
    志愿军成为他们汲取力量，克服一切困难的巨大源泉。今年，他们搬到新建的半自动化的轧钢厂来，他们小组帮着安装机器。天正冷，风刮得大，雪下得猛，新厂房还没有装好玻璃，地上落了一寸厚的雪，要刨冻土堆垫地基。有人说：“这样大的雪怎么能干活。”刘长福小组的孙景云就对大家说：“现在朝鲜战场不正下着大雪吗？志愿军打仗绝不会说天下雪就不打吧？他们还打得更漂亮！同志们，跟我来！”说着，他把棉袍一甩，就带头干起来。结果五天的活，一天半就干完了。烘钢炉的烟道结着一尺多厚的冰，要刨下来，就要钻进冰冷的烟道，跪在冰上刨。这时又有人犹豫起来。孙景云又对大家讲起志愿军运输队如何在冰天雪地中，翻山越岭地完成运输任务的艰苦情况。“咱们这点困难算得什么！”说着他一头就钻进烟道，几个青年小伙子也跟着进去了，三天活一天就干完了。试车的时候水淋了于宝才一身，有的地方马上结了冰，但他还坚持开车。有人劝他休息一下，他说：“为了国家工业化这算不了什么，比志愿军还差一个天地哩。”
    四月三日，他们在报上又看到志愿军今年春季的战绩。他们向志愿军写信祝贺，又报告他们迁入新建的轧钢厂的情形。四月十二日他们正式开车生产，二十一日又创了日产量的新纪录。
    在保卫祖国和建设祖国的事业中，他们和志愿军并肩前进！
