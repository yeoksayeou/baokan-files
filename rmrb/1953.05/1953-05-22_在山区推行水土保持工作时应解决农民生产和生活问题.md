    Resolving Farmers' Production and Living Problems When Promoting Soil and Water Conservation in Mountainous Areas
    Editor's Note: Planned prohibition of cultivating steep slopes and closing hillsides for afforestation in mountainous areas is one of the methods to improve natural conditions by doing a good job in soil and water conservation. However, soil and water conservation is a mass-based, long-term, and comprehensive task that must be combined with the actual needs of local production, mobilizing the masses to organize and carry it out for a long time in order to achieve the expected results. It must be closely coordinated with agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry construction plans to consolidate and expand the achievements of the work. However, according to readers' letters to this newspaper, Anhui's Huoshan, Lu'an, Susong and other places did not solve the production problems of the farmers when carrying out this work, resulting in difficulties in the lives of some farmers, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, and making it impossible for this work to achieve the expected results. This situation deserves attention. We are publishing the following abstracts of readers' letters, hoping that the Anhui Provincial People's Government will conduct inspections and lead and help the farmers in the above-mentioned areas to solve the production and living problems after banning the cultivation of steep slopes. We also ask that all areas where soil and water conservation work is being piloted pay attention to this issue.
    (I)
    Hua Liangmin from the Dushan Hydrological Station of the Huai River Management Commission writes: The People's Governments of Huoshan, Lu'an and other counties in Anhui Province, in order to do a good job in soil and water conservation to eradicate water disasters, decided to stop cultivating and return forests to all mountain land with a slope of more than 25 degrees. This approach certainly has a correct side; but they have overlooked another important issue: how to solve the production and living problems of the vast majority of people after closing the mountains. Therefore, there are many opinions among the local farmers, and this decision cannot be well implemented.
    As far as I know, most of the mountain land in the Dabie Mountains has a slope of more than 45 degrees, and there is very little arable land below 25 degrees. Therefore, the farmers here have always relied on cultivating steep slopes to maintain their lives (because the local soil is not good, it cannot be planted again after one or two years of cultivation, and new land must be cultivated). After the implementation of stopping cultivation and returning to forestry, they cannot continue to cultivate steep slopes, and their lives become a problem. Although the government provides relief to households with difficulties, this can only solve the living problems of individual farmers, and it is not a fundamental solution. Although the government has repeatedly emphasized that farmers should engage in sideline occupations, there are many difficulties in engaging in sideline occupations in mountainous areas. For example, the Han Chengbin mutual aid group near our station has held dozens of large and small meetings from last winter to the present in order to find ways to engage in sideline occupations, and we have also strongly supported them, but we have never found a way. In addition, in the past, many farmers here spent all year round busy cultivating mountain land, but now this group of labor force has nowhere to be used, and this problem has not been well resolved locally.
    Under such circumstances, soil and water conservation and afforestation work are difficult to do well. The phenomenon of logging in the area is very serious. Many trees are cut down before they have grown to a certain size, and many trees that could be used for industrial construction are cut down and sold as fuel. When we promote the policy of forest protection to the masses, some farmers ask: "If we don't cut down trees, we can't live." In some areas (such as Daqianrun in Huoshan County and Zhujiawan in Lu'an County), farmers ignore the decision to stop cultivating and return forests to the land and continue to cultivate. Those farmers who have stopped cultivating steep land also complain a lot and worry about their future lives.
    I think this issue is very important and should be resolved as soon as possible; therefore, I am reporting it to you, hoping to attract the attention of local leadership.
    (II)
    Qiao Chunmao and Wang Changyi from Xiaogang Township People's Government in Susong County, Anhui Province write: Our township is entirely mountainous. This year, the superior instructed that the masses are not allowed to reclaim wasteland; according to the situation in our area, this is very difficult to do. Because we have little farmland in the mountainous area, the masses can only maintain their lives by reclaiming wasteland to plant sweet potatoes; at the same time, the soil quality in our area is not good, and we have to abandon it after planting it for one or two years. Therefore, the masses have to reclaim wasteland every year. If we stop reclaiming wasteland for one year, we will have nothing to eat for half a year. Now the masses generally oppose the decision to ban wasteland reclamation. We believe that the ban on wasteland reclamation must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. We hope that the superior People's Government will study the specific situation in our township and properly solve the living problems of the masses.

### 在山区推行水土保持工作时应解决农民生产和生活问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    在山区推行水土保持工作时应解决农民生产和生活问题
    编者按：在山区有计划地禁开陡坡、封山育林，是做好水土保持工作、改进自然条件的方法之一；但水土保持是群众性、长期性和综合性的工作，必须结合当地生产的实际需要，发动群众组织起来长期进行，才能收到预期的功效。必须与农林、水利和畜牧各项建设计划密切配合，才能巩固和扩大工作的成绩。但是，根据本报读者来信反映：安徽霍山、六安、宿松等地在进行这一工作时，没有设法解决农民群众的生产问题，以致造成部分农民生活困难，引起群众不满，并使这一工作不能收到预期的效果。这一情况是值得重视的。现将读者来信摘要发表于后，希望安徽省人民政府进行检查，领导和帮助上述各地的农民群众解决禁垦陡坡后的生产、生活问题；并请各试行水土保持工作的地区也能注意这个问题。
    （一）
    治淮委员会独山水文站华亮民来信：安徽霍山、六安等县人民政府为了做好水土保持工作，以根治水患，决定在山区坡度二十五度以上的山地一律停垦还林。这个作法当然有正确的一面；但他们却忽略了另外一个重要问题：即封山后广大人民生产和生活问题，如何解决。因此，当地农民意见很多，这个决定也不能很好贯彻。
    据我所知，大别山区山地的坡度大部在四十五度以上，二十五度以下的可耕地寥寥无几。因此，这里的农民历来就靠着垦殖陡坡来维持生活（因当地土质不好，开垦后种了一两年就不能再种，就得另垦新地）。实行停垦还林后，他们不能继续开垦陡坡，生活就成了问题。政府虽然对生活困难户有救济，但这也只能解决个别农民的生活问题，而且也不是根本办法。政府虽一再强调要农民搞副业，但是山区搞副业困难很多，如我站附近韩承斌互助组为了设法搞副业，从去年冬季到现在大小会议开了数十次，我们也大力支持，但始终没有找到门路。此外，过去这里不少农民整年累月忙着开垦山地，现在这批劳动力就没处使用了，这个问题当地也没很好加以解决。
    在这样情况下，水土保持和造林工作是很难做好的。当地砍伐林木的现象很严重，有许多树木没长到一定的程度就被砍伐了，有不少可供工业建设使用的树木都被砍作燃料卖了。我们向群众宣传护林政策，有的农民提出：“如不砍树木，我们就不能生活了。”有些地区（如霍山县大乾润和六安县驻驾湾等地）的农民不管停垦还林的决定，仍然开垦种植；而那些已经停垦陡地的农民也怨言很多，焦虑今后的生活问题。
    我认为这个问题是十分重要的，应该及早解决；因此向你们反映，希望引起当地领导机关的重视。
    （二）
    安徽宿松县小岗乡人民政府乔春茂、王昌义来信：我乡全是山区。今年上级指示不许群众开荒山；根据我地情况，这是很难能做到的。因为我们山区田少，群众只有开荒山种红芋才能维持生活；同时我地土质不好，开一次种一两年又得丢掉。所以群众每年都得开荒山，如果歇一年不开荒山，就得半年没有吃的。现在群众普遍反对禁止开荒山的决定。我们认为：禁止开山必须要有计划、有步骤地进行。希望上级人民政府研究我乡具体情况，对群众生活问题作妥善解决。
