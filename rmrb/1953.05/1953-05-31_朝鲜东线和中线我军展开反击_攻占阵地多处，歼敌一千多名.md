Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 30th: On the night of the 27th, our army on the eastern and central fronts, with the support of powerful artillery fire, launched counterattacks on six enemy positions east of the Bukhan River and near Kimhwa. After an hour of fierce fighting, all these positions were captured, and all the defending enemies were annihilated. Preliminary statistics show that two entire enemy companies, one company headquarters, sixteen entire platoons, four squads, most of one platoon, and one artillery observation post were eliminated, totaling over 1,000 enemies. The spoils included two mortars, six 60mm mortars, two recoilless rifles, four rocket launchers, one anti-aircraft machine gun, eighteen light and heavy machine guns, seventy-five carbines and semi-automatic rifles, and four walkie-talkies and radios.

    On the eastern front, the "Square Hill" and two nearby enemy positions (including more than a dozen hills of varying sizes) between the area east of the Bukhan River and Byeonam-dong were important forward positions of the ROK (Republic of Korea) Army's 5th Division. The mountains were fortified with tunnels and many solid above-ground fortifications. However, after our army's fierce artillery bombardment, these positions were captured in fifteen minutes of intense fighting. On these three positions, our army eliminated the entire 9th Company, the 10th Company headquarters, three infantry platoons, three fire support platoons, two reconnaissance platoons, most of one infantry platoon, four squads and another artillery observation post of the 36th Regiment of the ROK Army's 5th Division, totaling over 500 enemies.

    At the same time, our army on the central front near Kimhwa also launched counterattacks and captured three enemy positions, including Nam-san south of Chestnut Village southeast of Kimhwa and near Guryong-ri southwest of Kimhwa, completely annihilating one entire company and eight entire platoons of the ROK Army's 5th and 8th Divisions.

    After our army captured the above six enemy positions, except for actively withdrawing from one position and two forward outposts, the remaining positions were involved in fierce fighting with the enemy who came to counterattack.

    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 30th: On the night of May 27th, our army's counterattacking forces on the eastern front captured the "Square Hill" between the area east of the Bukhan River and Byeonam-dong and two nearby enemy positions in one fell swoop, eliminating over 500 enemy soldiers.

    "Square Hill" was an important forward position of the ROK Army's 5th Division. Our army had launched eleven successful attacks on it last year. In the past six months, the enemy has constructed a three-layer fire defense system on the mountain, centered on tunnels and combined with covered trenches, moats, and steel-reinforced concrete bunkers, and laid out an obstacle zone seven to eight meters wide around the position with barbed wire.

    On the night of May 27th, the valley was filled with heavy fog, and our army's brave assault teams quietly moved towards the enemy positions on "Square Hill". At 9:07 p.m., a dense flash of machine gun bullets and grenade explosions appeared on a position 1,000 meters west of "Square Hill". After a swift close-quarters battle, one of our army's assault forces quickly eliminated all the enemy soldiers in a reinforced platoon stationed there. When the enemy's artillery frantically bombarded the retreat route of our army's force to block them, another of our army's assault teams launched a rain-like barrage of submachine gun fire on another position west of "Square Hill". At this time, two strings of red signal flares rose north of "Square Hill", signaling the start of the fierce attack on "Square Hill". Our army's artillery of various calibers began a fierce bombardment. Countless shells landed on "Square Hill", and the peak was engulfed in thick smoke and fire. Our army's assault team members couldn't help but shout:

    "Look at how well our artillery has given the enemy a great 'fiery hat'! Charge quickly, don't let a single enemy escape!" Brave and resourceful demolition experts quickly blew up the remaining barbed wire in front of the enemy's position, and the assault teams split into seventeen arrowheads and attacked "Square Hill" from all directions. After fifteen minutes of fierce fighting, all the enemies on the ground were eliminated by our army. Afterwards, our army's brave warriors also cleared out the enemies hiding in the tunnels.

    朝鲜东线和中线我军展开反击
    攻占阵地多处，歼敌一千多名
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】二十七日夜间，东线和中线我军在强大炮火配合下向北汉江以东和金城附近六处敌军阵地发起反击，激战一小时，就将这些阵地全部攻占，并将守敌全部歼灭。据初步统计，歼灭敌军两个整连、一个连部、十六个整排、四个班、一个排的大部和一个炮兵观察所，共一千多名；缴获迫击炮两门、六零炮六门、无后座力炮两门、火箭筒四门、高射机枪一挺、轻重机枪十八挺、卡宾枪和半自动步枪七十五枝、步行机和报话机四部。
    在东线北汉江以东到边岩洞之间的“方形山”及其附近的两个敌军阵地（包括十几个大小山头），是李伪军第五师的重要前沿阵地，山上都筑有坑道和许多坚固的地面工事。但是，这些阵地在我军炮火猛烈轰击后，经过十五分钟的激战即被我军攻占。我军在这三处阵地上，共歼灭守敌李伪军第五师第三十六团九连全部、十连连部、三个步兵排、三个火器排、两个搜索排、一个步兵排大部、四个班另一个炮兵观察所，共五百多名。
    与此同时，中线金城前线我军也反击攻占了金城东南栗洞南山和金城西南九龙里附近等三处敌军阵地，全歼守敌李伪军第五师、第八师的一个整连和八个整排。
    我军攻克以上六个敌军阵地后，除主动撤离一个阵地和两个前沿工事外，其余阵地都在和前来反扑的敌人激烈战斗中。
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】五月二十七日夜里，东线我军反击部队一举攻克北汉江以东到边岩洞之间的“方形山”及其附近两处敌军阵地，歼灭敌军五百多名。
    “方形山”是李伪军第五师的一个重要的前沿阵地。去年我军曾向它进行过十一次胜利的袭击。最近半年多来，敌人在山上构筑了以坑道为核心的、结合盖沟、壕堑和钢骨水泥地堡的三层火力防御体系，在阵地周围用铁蒺藜敷设了七、八公尺宽的阻碍地带。
    五月二十七日夜里，山谷里布满大雾，我军勇敢的突击队员们悄悄地向“方形山”敌军阵地运动。九时零七分，“方形山”以西一千公尺处的一个阵地上就密密地闪出了机关枪弹和手榴弹爆炸的火光。我军一支突击部队在短促的近战中迅速把据守在那里的一个加强排的敌人全部消灭之后，当敌人的炮火慌忙向我军这支部队的退路进行拦阻轰击的时候，我军另一支突击队又在“方形山”以西另一个阵地上打响了暴雨般的冲锋枪声。这时，“方形山”的北方升起了两串红色讯号弹，向“方形山”的猛烈攻击开始了。我军各种口径的大炮开始了猛烈的轰击。无数炮弹落在“方形山”上，山峰被浓烈的烟火吞没了。我军突击队员们忍不住喊道：
    “看咱们的炮兵给敌人戴了一顶多么好的‘火帽子’，快冲呀，不要放掉一个敌人！”勇敢机敏的爆破手们用快速的动作把敌军阵地前残余的铁蒺藜炸掉，突击队分成十七个箭头从四面八方打上“方形山”。经过十五分钟激烈的战斗，地面上的敌人被我军全部消灭了。以后，我军勇士们又肃清了躲进坑道的敌人。
