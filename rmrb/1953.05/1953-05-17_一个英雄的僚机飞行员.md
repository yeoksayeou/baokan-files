A Heroic Wingman Pilot
Haitian Liang Nan

Yang Zhenyu, a wingman pilot of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, wears a dazzling "Second Class Medal of Freedom and Independence" on his chest. This is a symbol of his special-class merit in the fight against the invading American air pirates and an honorable reward given to him by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This "Second Class Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force" has repeatedly risked his life to assist his comrades in emergency situations. While rescuing his comrades, he inflicted fatal blows on the enemy, shooting down three F-86 enemy aircraft and damaging one F-86 enemy aircraft.

Yang Zhenyu is the wingman pilot of Squadron Leader Sun Jinghua. As a Volunteer Army Air Force fighter with collective heroism, he clearly knows that in air combat, to ensure victory, the lead and wingman—as an inseparable combat unit—must act as one. Their victory is shared, and their honor is shared. Yang Zhenyu often thinks: My responsibility is to protect the lead pilot and assist in striking the enemy. I should not only be an air combatant but also an air guard. Only in this way can I ensure that my lead pilot can concentrate on directing combat and strike the enemy without worry. In a Party group meeting, he solemnly said: "The Party has placed me in the position of wingman, which means that when my comrades are safely attacking, I should prevent them from being threatened; and when my comrades are threatened, I should ensure their safety. I am willing to fulfill this responsibility even with my life."

In fierce air battles, Yang Zhenyu has always faithfully and bravely fulfilled the duty of a good wingman. On one occasion, Squadron Leader Sun led his squadron to intercept the enemy. A group of American air pirates were barbarously bombing peaceful villages in Korea, with plumes of smoke and flames rising from the ground. At this moment, our air force fighters, stirred by the will of revenge, immediately accelerated towards the enemy. The American air pirates, who were usually so ferocious towards the Korean people, turned and ran when they saw the People's Air Force's orderly formation coming head-on. How could we let this group of murderous executioners escape? The entire team of aircraft tracked them down. The great hatred for the enemy caused Squadron Leader Sun to fail to pay attention to the aircraft's altitude above the ground while chasing the enemy. Although the emotion of revenge also made Yang Zhenyu tense, he did not forget his more important duty, closely watching the lead plane's movements. Therefore, he was able to promptly discover that the squadron leader's plane was in danger of crashing into the ground and immediately reminded him: "Pay attention to altitude!" Squadron Leader Sun looked and, sure enough, was very close to the ground, so he quickly leveled off and continued to pursue the enemy aircraft. When Squadron Leader Sun caught up with the enemy aircraft and launched a fierce attack, Yang Zhenyu suddenly discovered four enemy aircraft about 1,000 meters behind to the rear flank, circling behind Squadron Leader Sun. This was a threat to the lead aircraft, which was attacking the enemy. Yang Zhenyu immediately turned around and rushed to the front of the enemy formation, driving away the four enemy aircraft, protecting the lead pilot's safe command and unreserved attack. In just this one battle, the entire squadron shot down and damaged a total of eight enemy aircraft.

It was another beautiful sunny day. Squadron Leader Sun led his unit to advance towards the combat zone. Just as everyone was vigilantly searching for enemy aircraft, Deputy Squadron Leader Wang Yonglou discovered eight F-86 enemy aircraft. "Today we have the chance to punish the American air pirates!" Everyone's spirits were particularly high, and their attention was focused on the target ahead. Yang Zhenyu's eyes were also fiercely monitoring the discovered enemy aircraft, preparing to join the attack with the lead plane. At this moment, the usual vigilance of a good wingman reminded him: "When you attack, you should check if there are any enemy aircraft behind you." He banked and looked back, and sure enough, two enemy aircraft had stealthily climbed up from the rear lower side, biting onto our pair of aircraft on the left rear flank, and were only 200 meters apart. The situation was very urgent. Turning around from the front, making a 180-degree turn to assist the comrades behind, was very dangerous for Yang Zhenyu because the turning speed was slow and the fuselage exposed a large area to the enemy, making it easy to be hit. However, any delay at this time would not only put his comrades in danger of being attacked by enemy aircraft, but even the entire unit would be directly threatened. The brave and alert Yang Zhenyu is not only the Squadron Leader's good wingman but also a good partner to all his comrades. He reported to the lead plane: "There are enemy aircraft behind! I'll go and help!" At the same time, he made a very violent left climbing turn with all his might, rushing towards the enemy aircraft. He used his actual actions to respond to the Party's call: "In air combat, assisting a comrade is more important than shooting down an enemy aircraft!" After hearing Yang Zhenyu's report, Squadron Leader Sun also unhesitatingly abandoned the target that could be attacked in an instant, covering Yang Zhenyu's counterattack against the enemy. The enemy, who was attacking our pair of aircraft, did not expect Yang Zhenyu to fight head-on. Frightened, it panicked and made the wrong move, entering a "spiral" and plunging into a deep valley. Seeing that the situation was not good, the wingman of this enemy aircraft tried to accelerate and escape, but Yang Zhenyu tightly bit it. As soon as it entered the sights, he pressed the cannon button, and the enemy aircraft, which had just been rushing around, dragged a plume of smoke and plunged into the sea.

The heroic deeds of the heroic wingman pilot Yang Zhenyu, who risked his life to assist his comrades, are being spread among the Volunteer Army Air Force. Everyone praises his noble qualities as a Communist Party member and his spirit of collective heroism in serving the overall interest. Many wingman pilots have expressed that they want to learn from his example, actively, bravely, and resourcefully cover the lead plane, and closely coordinate to strike the American air pirates.

    一个英雄的僚机飞行员
    海天　梁南
    志愿军空军某部僚机飞行员杨振玉的胸前，挂着一枚耀眼的“二级自由独立勋章”。这是他在打击侵朝美军空中强盗的战斗中，立过特等功的标志，是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国给予他的光荣的奖励。这位“中国人民志愿军空军二级战斗英雄”，屡次在紧急的情况下，奋不顾身地援助战友，并且在援救战友时，给敌人以致命的打击，先后击落F八十六型敌机三架，击伤F八十六型敌机一架。
    杨振玉是孙景华大队长的僚机飞行员。一个具有集体英雄主义教养的志愿军空军战士，他清楚地知道：在空战中，为了保证战斗的胜利，作为不可分离的一个战斗单位——长机和僚机，他们作战的动作要像一个人一样，他们的胜利是共同的，他们的荣誉是共同的。杨振玉时常这样想：我的责任就是在保护领队长机的前提下，协力打击敌人，我不仅应当是一个空中战斗员，而且应该是一个空中警卫员，只有这样，才能保证自己的领队长机全神贯注地指挥作战，毫无顾虑地打击敌人。在一次党的小组会上，他严肃地说：“党把我放在僚机的岗位上，就是叫我在战友安全进攻的时候，不使战友受到威胁；在战友受到威胁的时候，保证战友的安全。那怕用生命来完成这个责任，我都愿意。”
    在激烈的空战中，杨振玉一直忠实而勇敢地履行着一个好僚机的职责。有一次，孙大队长率领着他的大队出发迎击敌人，一群美国空中强盗正在向朝鲜的和平村庄进行野蛮的轰炸，地面上冒起一片片浓烟烈焰，这时，被复仇的意志激动着的我们的空军战士们，立即加大速度冲向敌群。平时对朝鲜人民是那样凶恶的美国空中强盗，看到人民空军整齐的编队迎面扑来，却掉头就跑。我们那能叫这群杀人的刽子手白白溜掉。全队飞机跟踪追了上去。对于敌人的高度的仇恨，使孙大队长在追击敌人中没有及时注意飞机距离地面的高度。复仇的情绪虽然也使杨振玉紧张起来，但他并没有忘记自己更重要的职责，密切地注意着长机的动作，所以他能及时发现大队长的飞机有撞地面的危险，立即提醒他：“注意高度！”孙大队长一看，可不是，离地面很近了，于是就很快飞平，继续向敌机追去。当孙大队长追上了那批敌机，猛烈地向敌机展开攻击时，杨振玉突然发现后侧方一千公尺左右，有四架敌机绕到孙大队长背后。这对于正在向敌机攻击的长机是一个威胁，杨振玉马上掉转头来，飞快地冲到敌人机群前面，把四架敌机驱逐掉了，保卫了领队长机安全指挥和放手攻击，仅仅这一次战斗，整个大队一共击落和击伤敌机八架。
    又是一个大好晴天。孙大队长带着部队向战区挺进。正在大家十分机警地搜索敌机时，副大队长汪永楼发现了八架F八十六型的敌机。“今天可有了惩罚美国空中强盗的机会了！”大家的精神格外振奋起来，注意力都集中到前面的目标上。杨振玉的眼睛也狠狠地监视着被发现的敌机，准备跟长机一起投入攻击。这时，一个好僚机惯有的警觉性提醒了他：“当你攻击的时候，应该看看后面有没有敌机。”他压着坡度回头一看，果然有两架敌机已经偷偷摸摸地从后下方爬高起来，咬住偏左后侧方我们的一对双机组，而且，相隔只有二百公尺了，情况是很紧急的。要从前面掉过头来，转一百八十度的大弯来援助后面的战友，对杨振玉是很危险的；因为转弯速度小，机身暴露给敌人的面积大，很容易被敌人击中。但是，这时如果稍一怠慢，不仅自己的战友会遭受敌机的偷袭，连整个部队也会直接受到威胁。勇敢机警的杨振玉，不仅是大队长的好僚机，而且也是全体战友的好伙伴。他一面报告长机：“后面有敌机！我去援助！”一面用尽全力拉了个非常猛烈的左上升转弯，火急地冲向敌机。他用自己的实际行动来响应党的号召：“在空战中援助一个战友，比打下一架敌机更重要！”孙大队长听到杨振玉的报告后，也毫不犹豫地放弃了转瞬就可攻击的目标，掩护着杨振玉向敌人反击。正在向我们一对双机组攻击的敌人，料不到杨振玉会跟它打对头，吓得惊慌失措，没等杨振玉开炮，这个怕死鬼就做错了动作，进入“螺旋”，栽到深谷里去了。这架敌机的僚机见势不好，企图加大速度逃命，杨振玉紧紧地咬住了它，一等套进瞄准镜，一按炮钮，这架刚才还横冲直撞的敌机拖着一股浓烟，一头钻到海里去了。
    英雄僚机飞行员杨振玉奋不顾身地援助战友的英雄事迹，在志愿军空军部队里传颂着。人人都称赞他这种共产党员的高贵品质，服从整体利益的集体英雄主义精神。许多僚机飞行员纷纷表示要学习他的榜样，积极、勇敢、机智地掩护长机，密切协同地去打击美国空中强盗。（附图片）
