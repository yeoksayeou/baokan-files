    Spring Sowing Basically Completed in North China and Other Places
    Vigorously Carrying Out Seedling Inspection, Replanting, and Seedling Protection Work
    The field sowing in North China has been basically completed, and seedling inspection, replanting, and seedling protection work are now being vigorously carried out.

    After widespread rainfall in North China on May 19th and 20th, the drought situation in the entire region has been basically eliminated. After the rain, local people's governments immediately led farmers in intensive planting. At present, except for a small amount of land reserved for late-maturing crops such as seed potatoes and peanuts in Hebei and Shanxi provinces, most general crops have been sown. In Suiyuan Province, where the season is later, sowing work is proceeding intensely, with oats and beans having been sown, and potatoes and flaxseed also about to be finished. Cotton sowing in Hebei Province has been completely finished, with the sown area roughly the same as last year. Cotton seedlings in Shanxi Province have now emerged from the soil and are growing vigorously.

    This year, the spring sowing techniques in some parts of North China have greatly improved compared with previous years. In Yuncheng and Wenxi counties in Shanxi, the spring land was generally plowed one to three times and harrowed two to seven times. Close planting was widely implemented in cotton fields in southern Shanxi. Scientific methods such as seed selection, seed soaking, and seed mixing have been adopted by more farmers. More than 80% of farmers in Jie County have adopted the "fixed temperature and time" soaking and mixing method. In Micang County in the Mengsui area, where there were few seed mixing devices, farmers took turns mixing seeds day and night. The amount of fertilizer applied in various places has also increased. Ping Shun County in Shanxi Province alone increased fertilizer application by more than 2 million dan compared to last year. The amount of fertilizer applied in cotton fields in Hebei has also generally increased compared to last year.

    This year's spring sowing in North China was completed in the struggle against spring drought. Since the beginning of spring, there has been a general lack of rain in various places, and farmers throughout the region, under the leadership of Party and government leading organs, have vigorously carried out drought resistance and emergency planting. Of the more than 1.8 million mu of cotton fields in southern Shanxi, more than 1.5 million mu of dry land were sown by resisting drought and preserving soil moisture. Yuncheng Prefecture in Shanxi Province dug and repaired more than 2,000 wells, renovated canals, and expanded paddy fields by more than 30,000 mu. During the tense period of sowing in Hebei, more than 10,000 cadres were dispatched from the province to the counties to lead farmers in using past drought resistance experience, developing all water sources, seizing and borrowing soil moisture, and implementing watering point planting. During drought-resistant sowing, more than 10,000 new and conical wells were drilled throughout the province, and more than 30,000 waterwheels were loaned out, enabling most crops to be sown in a timely manner.

    North China has been hit by wind, hail, insects, and frost this spring, which has greatly affected the growth of seedlings. Although sowing in the entire region has been largely completed, seedling inspection and replanting to ensure full seedling emergence is still a serious struggle task. In seedling-deficient areas in Hebei, the CCP organizations and people's governments are now educating farmers to break the conservative idea of "no replanting after the seventh day of the lunar month" and explain the importance of ensuring full seedling emergence for increasing grain production, vigorously leading farmers to carry out seedling inspection and replanting movements. Shanxi, Suiyuan, and other provinces are also carrying out this movement.

    Spring plowing and sowing in the Northwest Plain area have basically ended. Wheat and oats are being sown in the Qinghai mountainous areas where the season is later. Spring wheat and rice on the Ningxia Plain are already lush green. Various crops north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang have also been sown. Cotton seedlings in southern Xinjiang are now two to three inches high, and spring wheat in northern Xinjiang is also growing vigorously.

    In Ningxia, the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, and Xinjiang, approximately 20 million mu of cultivated land are irrigated by snow and river water. This year, farmers in these areas have repaired canals early, improved the water use system, and carried out sowing in a timely manner. The area sown with spring wheat in Ningxia Province this year has increased by about 10% compared to previous years. Summer hoeing and other work have now begun in these areas. Farmers in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi are harvesting wheat while also beginning cotton thinning and fixing seedlings.

    This year, the leadership of the spring plowing production by leadership organs at all levels in the Northwest Region is generally more in-depth and meticulous than in previous years. During the spring plowing period, the Party and government leadership organs of the Northwest Region and various provinces and cities successively dispatched approximately 2,000 cadres to go deep into the countryside to help farmers solve problems that occurred in spring plowing production. In order to solve the problem of reduced cotton production in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area of Shaanxi for many years, the departments in the Northwest Region and Shaanxi Province in charge of agricultural production specially dispatched agricultural scientific and technical personnel this spring to specifically guide cotton farmers in carrying out crop rotation, close planting, and ditch irrigation, and improved cotton planting techniques.

    The Fengcheng County Committee of the CCP in Liaodong Province promptly arranged for summer hoeing work to prevent the phenomenon of relaxing leadership over summer hoeing work in previous years.

    This year's spring plowing and sowing work in Fengcheng County was better than in previous years. The amount of fertilizer applied to both mountain and plain land has increased compared to previous years, and the county has promoted the high-yield experience of Guo Houqi (formerly Zhaoyuan County) on 10,000 qing (15 mu per qing) of cultivated land. At present, the county's main crops of corn and soybeans have completed their sowing plans, and rice transplanting has also begun. After the basic completion of spring plowing and sowing in the county, the Fengcheng County Committee of the CCP immediately convened a county-wide meeting of CCP District Committee Secretaries to arrange for summer hoeing. At the meeting, the tendency to relax leadership over summer hoeing in past years was criticized, and it was pointed out that it is very important to strengthen leadership over summer hoeing this year due to the promotion of Guo Houqi's high-yield experience. It was requested that all cadres earnestly lead the work of thinning seedlings, protecting seedlings, applying top dressing, weeding, preventing and controlling insect pests, and preventing drought and floods in summer hoeing in order to ensure a good harvest. The county is now conducting seedling inspection and replanting, and actively preparing for top dressing. In areas where pests have occurred, temporary pest control committees have been established in each village to lead farmers in timely eradication of pests.

    华北等地春季播种工作基本完成
    现正积极进行查苗补苗和保苗工作
    华北地区大田播种已基本完成，现正积极进行查苗补苗和保苗工作。
    华北各地自五月十九日、二十日普遍降雨后，全区的旱象已基本消除。雨后，各地人民政府立即领导农民紧张地进行抢种。目前河北、山西两省除少量留种山药蛋和花生等晚熟作物的土地外，一般作物已大都播种完毕。季节较晚的绥远省播种工作正紧张进行，燕麦、豆类播种已结束，山药蛋、胡麻等也将种完。河北省棉花播种已全部完成，播种面积大体和去年相同。山西省的棉苗现已出土，生长茁壮。
    今年华北部分地区的春季播种技术比往年有很大改进。山西运城、闻喜等县的春地普遍耕了一遍至三遍，耙了两遍至七遍。晋南棉田普遍实行了密植。选种、浸种、拌种等科学方法为更多的农民所采用。解县百分之八十以上的农户采用了“定温定时”浸拌法。蒙绥地区的米仓县，拌种器少，农民日夜轮流拌种。各地的施肥量也有所增加。山西省平顺一县就较去年增加肥料二百多万担。河北棉田的施肥量也较去年普遍增加。
    今年华北春季播种是在和春旱斗争中完成的。入春以来，各地普遍缺雨，全区农民在党政领导机关的领导下大力进行抗旱抢种。晋南一百八十多万亩棉田，其中有一百五十多万亩旱地是在抗旱抢墒中完成播种的。山西运城专区开凿和修复水井两千多眼，整修了渠道，扩大水田三万多亩。河北在播种紧张时期，从省到县曾先后派出一万多名干部领导农民运用往年的抗旱经验，开发一切水源，抢墒借墒，实行浇水点种。在抗旱播种中，全省新打和锥井一万多眼，贷出水车三万多部，使大部作物得以适时播种。
    华北地区在今春曾连遭风、雹、虫、冻等灾害袭击，这对禾苗的生长有很大影响。现在全区播种虽已大体完成，但查苗补苗，保证全苗，还是一个严重的斗争任务。在河北缺苗地区，中共组织和人民政府现正教育农民打破“七补八不补”的保守思想，说明保证全苗对粮食增产的重要意义，大力领导农民开展查苗和补苗运动。山西、绥远等省也正开展这一运动。
    西北平原地区的春耕播种已经基本结束。季节较晚的青海山地的小麦、燕麦正在播种。宁夏平原上的春麦、水稻已经一片葱绿。新疆天山南北的各种作物也都已下种，南疆的棉苗现已长有二、三寸高，北疆的春麦生长也很旺盛。
    宁夏、甘肃河西走廊和新疆共约有两千多万亩耕地是靠雪水和河水灌溉，今年这些地区的农民都及早修好渠道，改善了用水制度，适时地进行了播种。宁夏省今年的春麦播种面积较往年增加了百分之十左右。现在这些地区已开始夏锄等工作。陕西关中地区的农民，一面收割小麦，同时也开始进行棉花的间苗、定苗工作。
    今年，西北区各级领导机关对春耕生产的领导，一般都较往年深入细致。西北区及各省市的党政领导机关在春耕期间，曾先后派出约有两千多名干部，深入农村帮助农民解决春耕生产中所发生的问题。西北区和陕西省领导农业生产的部门为了解决陕西泾惠渠灌溉区多年来棉花减产的问题，今春曾专门调派农业科学技术人员具体指导棉农进行轮作、密植和实行沟灌，改进了棉花的种植技术。
    中共辽东省凤城县委员会及时布置夏锄工作，防止往年对夏锄工作放松领导的现象。
    凤城县今年的春耕播种工作比往年做得好，不论山地、平地的施肥量都比往年增加，全县并有一万垧（每垧十五市亩）耕地推行了郭后旗（原肇源县）的丰产经验。现在，全县的主要作物玉米、大豆都完成了播种计划，水稻也开始插秧。在全县春耕播种基本结束后，中共凤城县委员会便立即召开了全县中共区委员会书记会议布置夏锄。会上，批判了历年来放松夏锄领导的偏向，指出今年由于推行郭后旗的丰产经验，加强夏锄领导非常重要。要求全体干部在夏锄中切实领导做好间苗、保苗、追肥、铲?、防治虫灾和防止旱涝等工作，以保证丰收。现在全县正进行查苗补苗，并积极准备追肥。在已发生害虫的地区，各村都成立了临时性的治虫委员会，领导农民及时扑灭虫害。
