Xinhua News Agency, May 10th:

    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions continued its plenary session on the 10th.
    The executive chairmen of the meeting in the morning were Xu Zhizhen, Jin Zhifu, Yang Zhihua, Yang Zhenben, and Yang Chao.
    The congress first heard and unanimously approved the report on the examination of proposals by Xu Zhizhen, convener of the Proposal Examination Committee.
    Then, the congress heard and unanimously approved the report on the examination of the qualifications of representatives by Chen Shaomin, convener of the Credentials Committee. Chen Shaomin said in her report that there were a total of 831 representatives to this congress, with 813 having registered and attended the congress. The remaining 18 people were on leave due to official business or illness. The 813 representatives present represented 1,020,000 members from 29 provinces, 12 large cities, and one autonomous region. The representatives included representatives from industrial trade unions, as well as representatives from transportation, finance, trade cooperation, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, and cultural education and news departments; there were labor models, technicians, enterprise management personnel, trade union workers, and railway personnel who volunteered to assist Korea. These representatives included seven ethnic groups, including Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Uygur, and Korean. The representation was extremely broad. These representatives were all democratically elected by trade union member representative congresses or meetings convened by the general trade unions of provinces and cities or the municipal committees of industrial trade unions, and therefore were legitimate, had representative qualifications, and had the right to vote.
    After passing the report on the examination of representative qualifications, Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a summary of the discussion on the work report of the trade union. Lai Ruoyu said that after several days of discussion, the congress did not raise any different opinions on this report.
    Lai Ruoyu once again, on behalf of this congress and the workers of the whole country, expressed warm gratitude to Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Goroshkin, head of the Soviet trade union delegation, and many foreign trade union representatives for their encouragement and concern for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people.
    Lai Ruoyu said that Louis Saillant, Goroshkin, and many foreign trade union representatives, in their speeches to the congress, expressed their will to oppose aggressive war and defend world peace, which precisely reflected the will of the working class and people of the whole world, and also precisely reflected the will of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people, together with the Korean people, have paid a bloody price to defend peace in the Far East and the world. As long as the imperialists accept their shameful lessons and are willing to realize the Korean armistice, the Korean armistice can be realized. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people have been and will continue to struggle for the realization of the Korean armistice.
    Lai Ruoyu said that many trade union representatives from colonial countries, on the rostrum of this congress, accused the colonialists of oppression and expressed their determination to fight. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people deeply understand and express infinite sympathy for their situation and experiences. Based on its own experience, the Chinese working class deeply believes that the struggle of the workers and brothers in colonies and dependent countries is bound to be victorious. The Chinese working class will not only continue to support their struggle with the greatest strength, but also look forward to their victory with great confidence.
    In his summary, Lai Ruoyu emphasized: In a country led by the working class, correctly dealing with the issue of national interests versus individual interests is a hallmark of the workers' level of consciousness and a fundamental issue in trade union work. Lai Ruoyu particularly pointed out that first concentrating efforts on building heavy industry and national defense is the long-term and overall interest of the working class and the people of the whole country, the greatest need of the working class, and the need that should be met first. The improvement of the lives of the working masses must be subordinate to this need. He said that it is precisely because of these that the fundamental task of trade union work during the construction period was put forward at this congress.
    With the rapid expansion of the Chinese working class and the rapid increase of new workers, continuously improving the consciousness of the working class and strengthening and consolidating unity on this basis has become a serious task. Lai Ruoyu said that it is necessary to educate and influence new workers with the ideology of the working class and must never allow the ideology of small producers to gradually strengthen in the ranks of the working class.
    Lai Ruoyu called on trade union organizations at all levels to pay attention to and strengthen women workers' work, and trade union work in trade, cooperation, cultural education, and medical and health care, as well as work among the families of employees.
    In his summary, Lai Ruoyu once again emphasized the great significance of learning from the Soviet Union.
    The congress adjourned at 10:00 a.m.
    At 3:00 p.m., the plenary session continued.
    The executive chairmen of the meeting in the afternoon were Liu Changsheng, Chen Shaomin, Li Jiebo, Kang Yonghe, and Walis.
    Xu Zhizhen, Minister of the Organization Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, read out the draft of the Constitution of the Chinese Trade Union at the congress. Then, the constitution was unanimously passed as the official constitution of the Chinese Trade Union.
    The second item on the agenda of the afternoon session was to pass the list of candidates for members and alternate members of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and members of the Financial Review Committee. Executive Chairman Liu Changsheng first made necessary explanations on the issue of candidate nominations. He said that the list of candidates was proposed by trade union representatives from various regions and industries, and was determined after repeated consultations. The candidates include outstanding figures from workers in various regions and industries; there are men and women; there are Han and other ethnic minorities; there are labor models, technicians, enterprise management personnel, and trade union workers. The nomination of the list of candidates this time represents the opinions of the broad masses of employees, demonstrates the true spirit of democracy, and takes into account development and comprehensiveness. After the list of candidates is discussed and approved by the congress, a secret ballot will be used in the election. During the election, representatives have the right to cross out the name of any candidate on the list of candidates and elect someone else.
    Liu Changsheng then announced the number of personnel that should be elected by the congress, namely: 99 candidates for members of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (one of which is reserved for Taiwan), 42 candidates for alternate members, and 17 candidates for members of the Financial Review Committee, requesting the congress to approve them. All the representatives warmly applauded to express their approval and unanimously approved the above-mentioned quotas.
    Dong Xin, Deputy Secretary-General of the congress, read out the list of candidates one by one. Warm applause resounded throughout the hall, and the above-mentioned list of candidates was unanimously approved.
    Then, the congress unanimously passed the list of supervisors.
    At the afternoon session, all the representatives unanimously passed the following four resolutions: Resolution on the work report of the Chinese Trade Union, Resolution on the amendment of the Constitution of the Chinese Trade Union, Resolution on the report on the financial work of the National Trade Union, and Resolution on supporting the World Federation of Trade Unions to convene the Third World Trade Union Congress.
    The congress adjourned at 4:20 p.m.
    The congress will continue to hold a plenary session on the morning of the 11th.

    中国工会第七次全国代表大会十日会议
    通过工会工作报告等决议
    【新华社十日讯】中国工会第七次全国代表大会在十日继续举行全体会议。
    上午大会执行主席是许之桢、金直夫、杨之华、杨珍本、杨超。
    大会首先听取了并一致通过了提案审查委员会召集人许之桢关于提案审查的报告。
    接着，大会听取了并一致通过了资格审查委员会召集人陈少敏关于代表资格审查的报告。陈少敏在报告中说，这次大会的代表共八百三十一人，报到出席大会的八百一十三人。其余十八人因公和因病请假。到会的八百一十三位代表，代表二十九个省、十二个大城市、一个自治区的一千零二十万会员。代表中有产业工会的代表，也有交通、金融、贸易合作、农林水利、文教新闻部门的代表；有劳动模范、技术人员、企业管理人员、工会工作者、志愿援朝的铁路人员。这些代表包括汉、回、蒙、藏、哈萨克、维吾尔、朝鲜等七个民族。代表性极为广泛。这些代表都是由各省市总工会或各产业工会市委员会召开工会会员代表大会或会议民主选举出来的，因而是合法的，都具有代表资格，都有选举权。
    在通过了代表资格审查报告以后，中华全国总工会秘书长赖若愚向大会作了关于工会工作报告的讨论的总结。赖若愚说，大会经过几天讨论，对这个报告没有提出不同的意见。
    赖若愚再一次代表这次大会和全国工人，对世界工联总书记路易·赛扬、苏联工会代表团团长戈罗希金和许多外国工会代表们对中国工人阶级和中国人民的鼓励和关怀，表示热烈的感谢。
    赖若愚说，路易·赛扬、戈罗希金和许多外国工会代表在向大会致词中，都表示了反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平的意志，这正是反映了全世界工人阶级和全世界人民的意志，也正是反映了中国工人阶级与中国人民的意志。中国工人阶级与中国人民和朝鲜人民在一起，为了保卫远东和世界和平，付出了血的代价。只要帝国主义者接受他们可耻的教训，愿意实现朝鲜停战，朝鲜停战便可以实现。中国工人阶级与中国人民一直为并将要继续为实现朝鲜停战而斗争。
    赖若愚说，许多殖民地国家的工会代表，在这次大会的讲坛上，对殖民主义者的压迫提出了控诉，并表示了斗争的决心。对于他们的处境和遭遇，中国工人阶级和中国人民是深深了解并且表示无限同情的。根据自身的经验，中国工人阶级深深地相信殖民地和附属国的工人兄弟们的斗争，是必然要胜利的，中国工人阶级不仅将继续以最大的力量支持他们的斗争，并且以很大的信心期待他们的胜利。
    赖若愚在总结中着重指出：在工人阶级领导的国家里，正确地对待国家利益与个人利益的问题，是工人群众觉悟程度的标帜，也是工会工作中的一个根本问题。赖若愚特别指出，首先集中力量建设重工业，建设国防，这是工人阶级和全国人民的长远利益、整体利益，是工人阶级最大的需要，是首先应该满足的需要。工人群众生活的改善，要服从这个需要。他说，正是由于这些，这次大会上提出了建设时期工会工作的根本任务。
    在中国工人阶级队伍迅速扩大，新工人迅速增加的情况下，不断地提高工人阶级的觉悟程度，并在此基础上加强巩固的团结，就成为严重的任务。赖若愚说，必须以工人阶级的思想去教育和影响新工人，绝不能听任小生产者的思想在工人阶级队伍中日渐加强起来。
    赖若愚要求各级工会组织注意和加强女工工作，和贸易、合作、文化教育、医药卫生等方面的工会工作，以及在职工家属中的工作。
    赖若愚在总结中，再次强调了学习苏联的重大意义。
    上午大会进行到十时休会。
    下午三时，继续举行全体会议。
    下午大会执行主席是刘长胜、陈少敏、李颉伯、康永和、瓦力斯。
    中华全国总工会组织部部长许之桢在大会上宣读了中国工会章程草案。接着，全体一致通过这一章程作为中国工会的正式章程。
    下午大会的第二项议程是，通过中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会委员、候补委员和经费审查委员会委员的候选人名单。执行主席刘长胜首先对于候选人提名问题作了必要的说明。他说，候选人名单是由各地区、各产业的工会代表提出，经过反复协商而后确定的。候选人包括各地区、各产业工人中的优秀人物；有男的也有女的；有汉族也有其他少数民族；有劳动模范、技术人员、企业管理人员和工会工作者。这次候选人名单的提出，代表了广大职工的意见，表现了真正的民主精神，而且照顾到发展，照顾到全面。候选人的名单经大会讨论通过后，在选举时将实行无记名投票。选举时，代表有权利把候选人名单上的任何一个候选人名字划掉，而另选别人。

    大会副秘书长董昕一一宣读了候选人的名单。全场不断响起热烈的掌声，一致通过了上述候选人的名单。
    接着，大会又一致通过了监票人名单。
    在下午大会上，全体代表一致通过了以下四个决议：关于中国工会工作的报告的决议，关于修改中国工会章程的决议，关于全国工会财务工作的报告的决议，关于拥护世界工会联合会召开世界工会第三次代表大会的决议。
