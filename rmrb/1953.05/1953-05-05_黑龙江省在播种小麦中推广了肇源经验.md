Heilongjiang Province Promotes Zhaoyuan Experience in Wheat Sowing
Jin Langbai, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture, Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government

    According to statistics on April 9th, in Heilongjiang Province, the area sown with wheat in counties such as Suihua, Keshan, Hailun, Wangkui, Qing'an, and Suiling accounts for about 58% of the total wheat field area, while Zhaodong has sown 73%.

    Various counties have begun to adopt Zhaoyuan's new cultivation methods in wheat sowing. First, wheat sown with new agricultural tools generally adopted uniform and dense sowing, with row spacing ranging from a maximum of 15 cm to a minimum of 7.5 cm. Some also used the "cross-sowing method." Wheat sown with old agricultural tools using ridge planting generally widened the sowing width. According to statistics, in Baiquan County, 71% of the total wheat sowing area adopted the above-mentioned close planting method; in Keshan, it accounted for slightly more than 50% of the sown area. Second, the sowing amount was appropriately increased. Depending on the sowing density of new and old agricultural tools, the amount of seeds used ranged from approximately 170 to 180 jin to 450 jin per hectare, generally requiring the guarantee of 6 to 10 million wheat seedlings per hectare. Third, early sowing was achieved. This year, the wheat sowing period was generally 10 days to half a month earlier than last year. Fourth, in terms of seedling protection, most wheat seeds were wind-selected, screened, and water-selected, and treated with Ceresan and copper carbonate, cold water and warm water soaking, and five washes with clean water; pressing was done after sowing.

    Various counties in Heilongjiang Province have made a series of and long-term preparations in promoting the Zhaoyuan experience. In terms of ideological preparation, through patriotic production increase and ideological education on taking the new road, through Party rectification, winter training, provincial and county labor model conferences, mutual aid team leader, activist, and technician training classes, the Zhaoyuan experience was vigorously promoted. According to recent statistics, the province has successively organized 8,216 cadres, labor models, and experienced farmers to visit and study in Zhaoyuan, more than 130,000 backbone members have been trained, and more than 1.14 million farmers, both male and female, young and old, have been educated. Peasants in key villages, societies, and groups in various counties have initially understood Zhaoyuan's high-yield technology through practical education such as measuring furrow width, counting seedlings, calculating plant density, and weighing ears of wheat. In terms of organizational preparation, in addition to the newly established 68 agricultural technology guidance stations, agricultural technology guidance stations in farms and provinces, as well as mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, have been rectified. In terms of material preparation, according to statistics from 26 counties, approximately 127,000 agricultural tools have been renovated to implement the new cultivation method. In addition, new agricultural tools and a large amount of chemical fertilizers, as well as Ceresan and rhizobium, were distributed. All of these have created favorable conditions for promoting the Zhaoyuan experience.

    Heilongjiang Province paid special attention to the specific conditions of various regions in promoting the Zhaoyuan experience in wheat sowing this time. Before promoting the new cultivation method, various regions conducted high-yield surveys of various local crops in advance, linked them to the Zhaoyuan experience, and used local real people and real events to educate farmers. At the same time, most regions used state-owned farms, experimental farms, demonstration farms, and technical guidance stations as the technical guidance core of the new cultivation method, and advanced villages, settlements, groups, and societies as the key to promotion, and organized provincial and county labor models to take the lead in demonstration and organized visits to promote the masses. For example, when Comrade Song Wujia, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Jinbu Village, Baiquan County, successfully trial-planted "three seedlings in one furrow," he organized the masses to visit, overcame seasonal ideas such as "after Qingming and before Guyu, finish sowing wheat and then sow large fields," and resolved the masses' concerns such as "fear of seedling shortage, failure to grow, and increased labor costs." Village chief Fu of the central village took the lead in implementing the cold water and warm water soaking method to resolve the masses' doubts about "fear of scalding wheat seeds and not sprouting."

    The current problems in promoting the Zhaoyuan experience in Heilongjiang Province are: First, the principle of "general mobilization, key promotion" is not yet clear. There is a general sense of impatience and large plans to varying degrees in various counties. Some county and district leading cadres are not sure of the numbers. The Provincial Party Committee proposed to implement the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience on 15% of the land area, requiring an average yield of 8 to 10 shi per hectare, but some counties require a promotion area of 35%, and districts require 60%. For example, the Gucheng District of Keshan County requires the entire district to produce more than 10 shi per hectare, and requires four key villages to implement new cultivation methods on 70% of the land. This layer-by-layer increase in requirements may lead to the failure of the entire plan.

    Second, in promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, some leading cadres do not study technology enough, and there is still formalism and general leadership style. Therefore, many people still have ideas such as "fear of labor," "fear of wasteland," "fear of not being able to step on the soil," "fear of taking more public grain," "fear of spending more money on improved agricultural tools," and "fear of lack of fertilizer."

    Third, material preparation is insufficient, which is mainly reflected in the lack of manure and its poor quality. According to statistics from 18 counties, only 30.3% of the total fertilization has been completed. Seeds are also insufficient. For example, Anguang plans to sow 1,600 hectares of wheat, but due to the lack of seeds, only 450 hectares were sown. Keshan, Baiquan, Nehe, Hailun, and other counties also sowed 10% to 20% less wheat due to the lack of seeds. The quality of new agricultural tools is not good, and distribution is not timely. There are more wide-sowing agricultural tools made by the upper levels, and fewer made by the masses themselves, and some cannot be used. Ammonium sulfate and Ceresan are expensive, and the masses are unwilling to accept them. These are all problems that still need to be solved.

    黑龙江省在播种小麦中推广了肇源经验
    黑龙江省人民政府农业厅副厅长  金浪白
    据四月九日统计：黑龙江省绥化、克山、海伦、望奎、庆安、绥棱等县已种小麦占麦田总面积百分之五十八左右，肇东已种百分之七十三。
    各县在种麦工作中，开始采用了肇源的新耕作法。第一、各县用新农具播种的小麦，一般都采用了均匀密播法，行距最宽的为十五公分，最窄的为七·五公分，有的还采用了“交叉播种法”，用旧农具起垅播种的小麦，一般都加宽了播幅。据统计：拜泉县采用上述密植方法播种的占总播麦面积百分之七十一；克山约占已播面积百分之五十强。第二、适当增加了播种量。根据新旧农具播种密度不同，使用的播种量从每垧一百七、八十市斤到四百五十市斤左右，一般要求保证每垧地能生长六、七百万棵到一千万棵麦苗。第三、作到了早期播种。今年小麦播种期一般比去年早种十天到半月。第四、在保苗方面，大部麦种都经过了风选、筛选、水选，还采用了赛力散、王铜拌种，冷水温汤浸种，和五次清水洗种；播种后作到了镇压。
    黑龙江省各县在推广肇源经验中做了一系列的而且是长时间的准备工作。在思想准备方面，经过爱国增产和走好新道路的思想教育，经过了整党、冬训，省、县劳动模范会，互助组长、积极分子及技术员训练班，对肇源经验，都大张旗鼓地进行了宣传。据最近统计：全省先后组织干部、劳动模范、老农到肇源实地参观学习的有八千二百一十六人，受过训练的骨干分子有十三万多人，受到教育的男女老少农民有一百一十四万多人。各县重点村、社、组的农民经过量弓口、数楂子、算棵数、秤穗重的实际教育，已初步懂得了肇源的丰产技术。在组织准备方面，除了新设立农业技术指导站六十八处外，对农场和省原有的农业技术指导站以及互助组、农业生产合作社都进行了整顿。在物资准备方面，据二十六个县的统计，为了实行新耕作法改造的农具共有十二万七千件左右。此外还发放了新式农具和大量的化学肥料以及赛力散、根瘤菌等。所有这些，都给推广肇源经验准备了有利的条件。
    黑龙江省这次在播种小麦工作中推广肇源经验，特别注意了各地的具体条件。各地在推广新耕作法以前，都事先做了当地各种不同作物的丰产调查，联系肇源经验，用当地的真人实事教育农民，同时各地大都是以国营农场、试验场、示范场及技术指导站为新耕作法的技术指导核心，以先进村、屯、组、社为推广重点，并以省、县劳动模范带头示范、组织参观，推动群众。例如拜泉县进步村中共支部书记宋戊甲同志试种“一垅三苗眼”成功时，组织了群众参观，克服了“清明后、谷雨前，种完小麦种大田”等季节思想，并解决了群众“怕苗荒、长不起来、多费工”等顾虑。中心村傅村长带头实行冷水温汤浸种的办法，解决了群众“怕烫坏麦种不出芽”的怀疑。
    目前黑龙江省各地在推广肇源经验中存在的问题是：第一、对“普遍号召，重点推广”方针还不明确。各县普遍存在着不同程度的要求高、计划大的急躁情绪。有的县、区领导干部心中无数。省委提出在百分之十五的土地面积上推行肇源丰产经验，要求每垧平均产量在八石到十石以上，但某些县却要求推广面积百分之三十五，区要求百分之六十。例如克山县古城区要求全区每垧产十石以上，要求四个重点村在百分之七十土地上实行新耕作方法。这样一层比一层要求高，可能影响全部计划落空。
    第二、在推广肇源丰产经验中，某些领导干部钻研技术不够，仍然存在着形式主义和一般化的领导作风。因此，有很多群众尚存在着“怕费工”、“怕荒地”、“怕趟不上土”、“怕多拿公粮”、“怕改良农具多花钱”、“怕没肥料”等思想。
    第三、物资准备不足，这主要表现在粪肥少，而且质量差。据十八个县统计：完成施肥总数的只有百分之三十点三。种子也不够用，如安广计划播麦一千六百垧，因缺种子只种了四百五十垧。克山、拜泉、讷河、海伦等县因缺乏种子也少种小麦百分之十到二十。新农具质量不好，发放不及时，宽播农具上边做的多，群众自己做的少，有的不能应用。硫安、赛力散价格高，群众不愿接受。这些都是当前仍应解决的问题。
