    Xinhua News Agency, May 20th—London "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Kaesong on the 20th: After all the tricks played by the US side here failed, they are now systematically bombing North Korean reservoirs, with the aim of causing large-scale destruction, flooding crops, and drowning large numbers of farmers. Disregarding world opinion, they are choosing this moment to adopt a "tough policy" in the armistice negotiations, while engaging in new and futile acts of destruction. One of their targets is the Supung Reservoir, which they specifically bombed on the 10th of this month. The destruction of this reservoir will affect both China and Korea. It is more than just the simple bombing mentioned in the US Air Force's communique. Since May 10th, they have bombed the reservoirs in Sunan and Sunchon, causing severe suffering to tens of thousands of farmers and the deaths of hundreds and thousands of people. This situation is reminiscent of last year when the US side sabotaged the Yalu River power plant, which also served China, when peace in Korea seemed close to being realized. This is happening just as rumors are swirling in Tokyo, saying that the US side is drafting a new ultimatum, threatening to immediately "release" the POWs of the Korean and Chinese side before the armistice is signed, putting forward a "final take-it-or-leave-it" proposal, and spreading the old rhetoric from Washington's "take a hard line and go it alone" faction. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on the 19th pointed out: "The United Nations Command (Agence France-Presse is referring to the US military) must consider the opinions represented by Senator McCarthy in the United States and Syngman Rhee's strong opposition to the armistice; on the other hand, it must also consider the opinions of other allies, such as Britain, France, and Canada." The fact is that Harrison's casual tearing up of the Indian proposal passed by the United Nations has clearly shown that McCarthy has a much larger say in the armistice negotiations than America's "allies." As for the puppet Syngman Rhee, he has now been ordered to probe the situation for the United States, testing whether it is feasible to hand over the POWs to him immediately "if negotiations break down." The whole world knows that negotiations do not break down due to accidental events. The US side caused the negotiations to break down when the possibility of peace seemed very high. In short, Syngman Rhee never speaks without Washington's approval. All indications during this long recess show that the US side is trying to prevent any action that would bring about an armistice in Korea. Nolan even threatened to withdraw from the United Nations, following the example of Germany and Japan, who withdrew from the League of Nations before launching world wars. In the speculation about what the US side might or might not do on the 25th, it is quite possible to add things they cannot do. As far as the Korean and Chinese side is concerned, any suggestion to hand over the POWs to their enemies is completely unacceptable. Any differential treatment of the Korean and Chinese POWs is completely unacceptable. Any restrictions aimed at binding neutral countries in advance to prevent proper explanations to the POWs intimidated by the US side are also completely unacceptable. All these conspiracies of the US side aimed at preventing the realization of an armistice also affect the countries fighting alongside the US here. If based on the Korean and Chinese proposals agreed upon by world opinion, peace can be achieved quickly.

    揭露美方阻止实现停战的阴谋诡计
    【新华社二十日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十日自开城报道：美方在这里玩弄的一切手段都失败后，现在正对朝鲜的贮水池进行有计划的轰炸，其目的是造成大规模的破坏、淹没庄稼和溺死大批农民。他们不顾世界舆论，选择这个时候，一方面在停战谈判中采取“强硬政策”，一方面进行新的无用的破坏活动。他们攻击的一个目标是水丰贮水池，他们在本月十日曾特别对它进行了轰炸。这个贮水池的破坏将同样影响中国和朝鲜，它不止是美空军在公报中所说的简单的轰炸。自从五月十日以后，他们轰炸了在顺安和顺川的贮水池，使成千上万的农民遭受了严重的痛苦，并有千百人死亡。这个情况使人想起去年当朝鲜的和平看来快要实现的时候，美方破坏也为中国服务的鸭绿江发电厂的事。这个情况的发生正当东京谣言纷纭的时候，东京的谣言说，美方正在草拟新的最后通牒，就是用在停战前把朝中方面战俘立即“释放”来威胁而提出的“最后予以接受或拒绝”的建议，并传为朝中方面的接受规定了时限，以及华盛顿的“采取强硬态度，单独干下去”一派的那老一套的说法。法新社东京十九日消息指出：“联合国军方面（法新社是指美军）必须考虑到参议员麦卡锡在美国所代表的意见和李承晚的强烈反对停战的意见；另一方面，也必须考虑其他盟国，像英国、法国和加拿大的意见。”事实是，哈利逊的随便撕毁联合国通过的印度方案，已清楚表明麦卡锡对停战谈判的发言权比美国的“盟国”大得多。关于李承晚这个傀儡，他现在已奉命为美国试探形势，试探一下在“如果谈判决裂时”马上把战俘交给他行不行。全世界都清楚知道，谈判是不会因偶然事件而中断的。谈判是在和平可能性看来很大时，美方使它中断的。总之，李承晚若不经华盛顿批准，是从不开口的。在这个长时休会期间的一切迹象都表明，美方正努力防止会使朝鲜实现停战的任何行动。诺兰甚至扬言要退出联合国，效法以前为进行世界战争而退出国际联盟的德国和日本，在关于美方二十五日可能做什么或不做什么的猜测中，很可以加上他们所做不了的东西。就朝中方面而论，任何把战俘交给他们的敌人的建议，都是完全不能接受的。对朝中战俘的待遇的任何差别，都是完全不能接受的。任何旨在预先束缚中立国以阻止对美方所恐吓过的战俘进行适当解释的限制，也是完全不能接受的。美方这一切旨在阻止停战实现的阴谋诡计，同样影响了在这里和美国一道作战的国家。若以世界舆论所同意的朝中方案为基础，那么和平是会很快实现的。
