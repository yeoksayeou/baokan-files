From our Guangxi reporter station, Sun Zunian:

    Leaving Tiandong County in Guangxi and heading south, crossing the You River and following its tributary, the Clear Water River, for about fifty li, you arrive at a newly established township called New Development Township, where newly relocated Yao people live.

    During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, a policy of eliminating ethnic minorities was implemented. The reactionaries called the original place where these Yao people lived "Assimilation Township," forcing the Yao people onto steep stone mountains, making them live in crude thatched huts or caves year-round, and forcing them to change their clothing. They planted corn and other grains in the cracks of the rocks, but the yield was very low, and their lives were very poor. In Longlue Village, out of 97 Yao households, only 10 could barely make a living, 61 households lacked food for six to eight months each year, and the rest relied on wild vegetables to survive year-round. Plough cattle, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizer were lacking in every household. Many Yao people, with five or six family members sharing two or three sets of clothes, often suffered from the cold of harsh winters and long nights. Many Yao people were tormented into being emaciated in this difficult life of not having enough to eat or wear.

    The Tiandong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tiandong County People's Government, in order to change the impoverished lives of the Yao people and for their long-term interests, decided to help them move from the stone mountains to areas with better soil. The Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Government also dispatched three ethnic minority cadres to cooperate with the local district government in carrying out the relocation work. Due to the historical impact of the Kuomintang reactionaries sowing discord among ethnic groups in the past, the Yao people initially had great concerns about moving down the mountain, such as fear of being forced to change their customs and habits, and fear of oppression and bullying by the Zhuang people, and so on. In order to dispel these concerns, the county held a mobilization meeting at the People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups, explaining the benefits of moving down the mountain and guaranteeing that everything would be done according to their customs and habits after the move. The Zhuang representatives also expressed their sincerity in helping the Yao people and organized Yao representatives to visit the area below the mountain. Yao cadre Wei Rijing also returned to his hometown to assist in the relocation work. He tirelessly promoted Chairman Mao's ethnic policy among the Yao people and used his own personal experience to persuade the Yao people who had ideological concerns. The Yao people trusted the propaganda of their own ethnic cadres very much, and quickly the word spread far and wide, and they unanimously realized that the relocation area was much better than the original stone mountain area. In March and April of last year, 146 Yao households moved down from the high mountains and remote areas.

    The People's Government built new houses for the relocated Yao people, distributed wasteland and barren land, and also provided each person with food, clothing, and mosquito nets. It also lent them the necessary tools for production, lending one plough cattle for every five people, and also sent a health worker to live here permanently to treat their illnesses. The nearby Zhuang people demonstrated the spirit of unity and friendship, warmly welcoming and actively helping the newly relocated Yao people. Many Zhuang farmers voluntarily sent timber and went up the mountain to cut thatch to add new houses for the Yao people. Some also provided them with food and farm tools. The Zhuang people of Gaozhai Village helped the Yao people who did not have enough houses to build more than 140 rooms in half a month, allowing the Yao people to settle down happily. Although the houses where the Yao people live here are still very simple and the means of production and production tools are not yet sufficient, it is much better than when they lived on the mountain, without adequate clothing, not having enough to eat all day long, and carrying out production in the cracks of the rocks.

    The Yao people, who had always lived on the stone mountains, had never used ploughs or harrows, and had never grown rice. When the People's Government distributed a large number of ploughs, harrows, hoes and other farm tools to them and lent them plough cattle, they did not know how to use them. Women led the cattle and men held the ploughs, staggering back and forth in the fields, sweating profusely, and the cattle were also panting from exhaustion, but the ploughshare would not enter the soil; when it did enter the soil, it was uneven, either too deep or too shallow; some even broke the ploughshares. They were even more incapable of sowing and transplanting rice seedlings. These practical difficulties once caused some Yao people to waver in their thinking, thinking that these difficulties could not be solved and still wanting to return to the stone mountains to plant miscellaneous grains and corn in the cracks of the rocks. When the nearby Zhuang farmers learned of this situation, each village immediately held meetings and decided to organize themselves to teach the Yao people how to plough and harrow fields, sow, transplant rice seedlings, manage water use, feed cattle, and use cattle, and other agricultural production techniques. When Yao farmer Lan Yiman harrowed the field, he harrowed from low to high, and no matter how he harrowed, he could not level it. Zhuang farmer Huang Youxin taught him to harrow from high to low, and the result was very good. When transplanting rice seedlings, Lan Yiman thought that the more water in the field, the better, but Huang Youxin taught him to release some of the water so that the seedlings would be exposed above the water to avoid being drowned. With the help of Huang Youxin, Lan Yiman quickly learned various techniques in agricultural production and actively went to teach the farmers of his own ethnic group. In this way, all the Yao farmers quickly learned how to cultivate the fields. Those who originally wanted to move back to the stone mountains no longer wanted to go back.

    The Yao people of the newly established New Development Township had a relatively good autumn harvest last year, and now they are harvesting wheat. The hardworking Yao people are working diligently in the fields in the valleys or at the foot of the mountains. All the field ridges are covered with new soil, and the green rice seedlings are growing in the water. People have built a small canal from high places, winding and turning, drawing mountain springs into the fields. The barren fields here have become fertile fields.

### 从石山上移下来的瑶族人民

    从石山上移下来的瑶族人民
    本报广西记者站  孙祖年
    出广西田东县城，向南，跨过右江，沿着它的支流——清水河进发，约五十里，便到了一个新建的乡——新发乡，那里住着新移来的瑶族人民。
    国民党反动统治时期，实行着消灭少数民族的政策；反动派把这个瑶民原来住的地方，叫做“同化乡”，把瑶族人民逼上陡峭的石山，使瑶族同胞常年生活在简陋的茅屋或山洞里，被迫改变服装。他们在石缝里种植玉米和杂粮，产量很低，生活非常贫困。陇略一个村九十七户瑶族同胞，除了十户能勉强维持生活外，六十一户每年缺六个月至八个月的粮食，其余的人则终年靠野菜充饥。耕牛、农具、种子、肥料则家家缺乏。有不少瑶族同胞一家五六口人伙穿两、三套衣服，经常遭受严冬和长夜寒冷的侵袭。瑶族同胞在这种吃不饱、穿不暖的艰苦日子里，很多人被折磨得面黄肌瘦。
    中共田东县委会和田东县人民政府为了改变瑶民的贫穷生活，为了他们的长远利益，决定帮助他们从石山上迁移到土质较好的地区。县人民政府民政科并派出三个少数民族干部，配合当地区人民政府进行移民工作。由于过去国民党反动派挑拨民族团结的历史影响，开始时瑶族同胞对迁下山来存有很大的顾虑，如怕强迫改变风俗习惯，怕僮族压迫欺侮他们，等等。为了解除顾虑，该县在各族各界人民代表会上进行了动员，说明迁下山来的好处，保证搬出来后一切依照他们的风俗习惯；僮族代表也表示了帮助瑶民的诚意，并且组织瑶族代表下山参观。瑶族干部韦日景也回乡协助移民工作，他不分昼夜的在瑶族同胞中宣传毛主席的民族政策，并用自己的亲身体验去说服思想上有顾虑的瑶族人民。瑶族人民很相信自己本民族干部的宣传，很快地一传十，十传百地影响开了，一致认识了移民区比原来石山区好得多。去年三、四月间，从高山野岭上迁移下来了一百四十六户瑶族同胞。
    人民政府给迁下来的瑶族同胞新盖了房屋，分配了荒田荒地，还发给每人口粮、衣服、蚊帐，贷给了生产中必需的工具，每五人贷耕牛一头；还派了一个卫生员长期住在这里，为他们治病。附近的僮族人民发挥了团结友爱的精神，对新迁下来的瑶胞热情地欢迎和积极地帮助。很多僮族农民自动送木料，上山割茅草，为瑶族同胞添砌新房。有的还接济他们口粮和农具。高寨村的僮族同胞半月内帮助房屋不够的瑶民盖砌了一百四十多间房，使瑶族同胞愉快地安居下来。目前这里的瑶民住的房子虽然还很简陋，生产资料和生产工具还不十分充足，但比原先住在山上时衣不避体、终日不得一饱、在石头缝里进行生产的时候是好得多了。
    一向住在石山上的瑶民，从来没有使用过犁、耙，没有种过水稻。当人民政府发给他们大批犁、耙、锄头等农具，贷给他们耕牛时，他们不知道怎样使用。妇女牵着牛、男的掌犁，在田里东颠西倒，累得满头大汗，牛也累得喘不过气来，但犁舌总不入土；入了土也不均匀，不是太深就是太浅；有的把犁头都犁断了；播种、插秧就更不会了。这些现实困难，曾引起一部分瑶族同胞思想动摇，认为这困难解决不了，仍想回石山去在石头缝里种杂粮和玉米。附近僮族农民知道了这一情况，各村立即召开会议，决定有组织地分头去教瑶族同胞犁、耙田地、播种、插秧、管理用水、饲牛、用牛等农业生产技术。瑶族农民蓝以满耙田时是由低处往高处耙，耙来耙去总是耙不平，僮族农民黄有信就教他由高处往低处耙，结果耙得很好。插秧时蓝以满以为田里水越多越好，黄有信就教他把水放出一些，使秧苗露出水面，以免被水浸死。在黄有信的帮助下，蓝以满很快地学会了农业生产上各种技术，就又积极地去教本民族的农民。这样，所有的瑶族农民都迅速地学会了耕种田地。原来想搬回石山的人，也不再想回去了。
    新建立新发乡的瑶族人民，去年得到了较好的一次秋收，现在又收割麦子了。勤劳的瑶族人民在山谷或山脚处的田野上辛勤地操作着，所有的田埂都培着新土，秧苗绿油油的长在水面上。人们从高处修筑了一道细渠，将山沟泉流弯弯曲曲灌引到田里来。这里的荒田已变成了良田。
