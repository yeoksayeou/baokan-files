    Transformation
    Chen Zhuo
    "In the past, I was often distressed by having nothing to do all day, but now I deeply feel the joy of being busy at work every day." This is a true feeling of Comrade Wang Zhirong after the transformation of his thinking and work style in leading agricultural production.
    Wang Zhirong has been the production assistant of the First District of Guangyuan County, Sichuan Province, for more than three years. In the past two years, in a series of social reform movements, he learned a set of work methods that were all sound and fury, signifying nothing. In the spring of 1952, the central task of Guangyuan's rural areas shifted to production. Although the leadership said that the work style should be transformed, Wang Zhirong's thinking was still vague. He felt that the future of rural work was not promising, so he was unwilling to put his heart into studying the work. He often sat in the township people's government issuing orders, mechanically passing on the instructions from above. He would often talk down to the township and village cadres and mutual aid team leaders, using "labeling" as a method of "leadership." As a result, Zhou Dunli, the director of Pingqiao Village, resolutely asked for leave last April; mutual aid teams such as Jing Yongfa's almost collapsed because of this. Township cadres and the masses generally called Wang Zhirong a "labeling expert" and a "formalist leader."
    Wang Zhirong became increasingly detached from the masses, and thus felt even more distressed. He was afraid to go to the mutual aid teams, dared not ask about the farmers' field production, fearing that the farmers would "embarrass" him with questions. By last November and December, Wang Zhirong was thinking: I have been engaged in rural work for so long, it's time to transfer; it would be nice to be transferred to a bookstore in the city to sell books, or to a cooperative to sell goods, why should I be left in the countryside to "suffer"? Sometimes he even thought of simply going home to produce.
    This year's spring plowing and production began, and Wang Zhirong's ideological baggage became even heavier. On the morning of March 6, Comrade Wang Jiusi, the secretary of the district party committee, said to him: "Agricultural production is also an important task at this stage. If we neglect agricultural production, our country's economic construction will be crippled." At this time, Wang Zhirong initially realized that rural work was not as "unpromising" as he had imagined.
    However, when he returned to Yuchi Township the next day, he was still very depressed because he didn't know how to conduct in-depth and specific leadership. At this time, Li Lie, the secretary of the Guangyuan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to this township to lead production. One night, Li Lie discussed production experience in the home of old farmer Sun Jianjie, humbly asking Sun Jianjie for advice. Li Lie's work style gave Wang Zhirong a great inspiration. He thought: He is the county party secretary, and if he doesn't understand, he doesn't understand, and he can humbly learn, why don't I learn when I don't understand? How can I go deep into the specific leadership of others? The more he thought about it, the more he felt that his past work style was wrong, and the more he felt that he had to learn from Li Lie. Wang Zhirong also repeatedly studied the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Spring Plowing and Production to Party Committees at All Levels" and the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production." He had a preliminary understanding of the importance of agricultural production and the mass line of leadership. In late March, the village's work on new-style seedling fields was about to begin. Wang Zhirong then made up his mind: to do this work well, he must first understand it himself. He began to study the methods of making new-style seedling fields, and investigated the past experience of old farmers Jing Xuexi, Sun Jiuqian, etc., in making seedling fields, and at the same time learned about the ideological concerns of the farmers about making new-style seedling fields. He learned from the fact that Jing Xuexi's planting of five-fen of "banban seedlings" last year yielded 120 jin more grain than his neighbor's, and the methods he used. With confidence, he adopted methods such as typical demonstrations at the village and team levels and organizing visits, so that new-style seedling fields were quickly popularized throughout the village. The masses of the whole village are generally satisfied with the new-style seedling fields. Jing Yongfa's mutual aid team has also been upgraded from a seasonal mutual aid team to a near-permanent one through the promotion of advanced production experience.
    After Wang Zhirong's thinking and work style changed, village cadres and the masses became affectionate with him, and went to him to talk about things. He can also live with the farmers in the fields. Jing Yongfa, the leader of the mutual aid team, said: "In the past, Comrade Wang was unwilling to learn from others, but now he is willing to discuss and find ways with everyone, which is indeed a great help to our production work." Zhou Dunli, the director of the village representative, also said: "Last year, Wang Zhirong asked the farmers to pick the hearts and prune the cotton, but he himself did not understand it, and few farmers listened to him; this time, he understood the new-style seedling fields first, so we love to listen to him." In the smooth progress of his work, Wang Zhirong began to feel the joy of working.

    转变

    “过去老感到一天没事干的苦恼，现在深感到每天工作紧张的愉快”。这是王芝荣同志领导农业生产的思想作风转变以后的一点真切的感受。
    王芝荣作四川省广元县第一区的生产助理员，已经三年多了。前两年，他在一系列的社会改革运动中，学了一套大轰大擂的工作方法。一九五二年的春天，广元农村的中心工作转入了生产。尽管领导方面说工作作风要转变，但王芝荣的思想上却是模模糊糊的。他认为农村工作的前途不大，也就不肯用心钻研工作。他常常坐在乡人民政府下命令，把上面布置的一套，原原本本地硬搬下去。他动不动就向乡、村干部和互助组长打官腔，用“扣帽子”的办法进行“领导”。去年四月平桥村主任周敦礼便因此坚决请假不干；敬永发等互助组也曾几乎因此垮台。乡干部和群众一般都称王芝荣是“帽子专家”、“形式领导”。
    王芝荣一天一天地脱离了群众，因而也就越加感到苦恼。他害怕到互助组里，不敢过问农民的田间生产，怕叫农民问“窘”了，难为情。到去年十一、二月间，王芝荣竟这样想：我搞农村工作这么久了，该调的着了；调到城里头的书店去卖书，或者到合作社里去卖货也不错，为啥偏偏叫我留在农村“受罪”呢？有时竟想干脆回家生产去。
    今年的春耕生产开始了，王芝荣的思想包袱益发沉重了。三月六日早晨，区委书记王久世同志对他说：“农业生产在现阶段也是重要的工作，若忽视了农业生产，我们国家的经济建设，就会跛起脚来。”王芝荣这时才初步地意识到农村工作并不是自己想像的那样“没有什么前途”。
    可是，第二天回到了鱼翅乡，仍然因为不知道怎么深入具体领导，非常苦闷。这时，中共广元县委书记李烈来到这个乡领导生产。一天夜里，李烈在老农孙见杰家中谈生产经验，虚心地向孙见杰请教。李烈的这种工作作风，给了王芝荣一个很大的启示。他想：人家是县委书记啦，不懂的就是不懂，能虚心地学习，我为啥自己不懂又不学呢？这又咋能去深入具体地领导人家呢？越想越觉得过去的作风不对头，越想越觉得非向李烈学习不可。王芝荣又反复地学习了“中国共产党中央委员会关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”及人民日报社论“领导农业生产的关键所在”等文件。他对农业生产的重要性和群众路线的领导方法有了初步的体会。三月下旬，村上做新式秧田的工作快开始了。王芝荣当时便下定了决心：要搞好这个工作，自己非先懂得它不可。他开始钻研做新式秧田的方法，又向老农敬学熙、孙九乾等调查他们以往做秧田的经验，同时了解了农民群众对于做新式秧田的思想顾虑。他学习了敬学熙去年种“板板秧”五分田就比邻居多收谷子一百二十市斤的事实和做法。他心中有了底，便采用了村组层层典型示范、组织参观等方法，使得新式秧田很快就在全村推广开了。全村群众一般对新式秧田感到满意。敬永发互助组也通过推广先进生产经验，由季节性互助组提高到接近常年性的了。
    王芝荣的思想作风转变以后，村干部和群众都对他亲热了起来，有事就去找他谈。他也能在田边地角和农民生活在一起了。互助组长敬永发说：“过去王同志不肯向人学习，现在肯和大家商量想办法，对我们的生产工作确实帮助不小。”村代表主任周敦礼也说：“去年王芝荣叫农民把棉花摘心整枝，他自己也不懂，农民也很少听他的话；这次做新式秧田，他先懂了，我们就爱听他的话了。”王芝荣在工作的顺利进展中，开始感到了工作的愉快。
