    The Valiant Fighting Korean Working Class
    ——A Visit to the Korean Trade Union Delegation
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    On the eve of May Day, we interviewed Fang Taiyu, head of the Korean Trade Union Delegation and Chairman of the Korean Mining Workers' Union, and Park Sam-ryun, a member of the delegation and Director of the Wage Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, who were invited to our capital to attend the May Day International Labor Day celebrations and the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union.
    From their conversation, I saw the heroic face of the Korean working class, who are fighting valiantly to defend peace and their motherland.
    In the war against the American aggressors, the heroic Korean working class responded to the great call of Premier Kim Il-sung and devoted all their strength under extremely difficult conditions. With high labor enthusiasm, they plunged into the patriotic production increase campaign. Even in a wartime environment, production increased year by year, with industrial production in 1952 increasing by 19 percent compared to 1951. Many workers have created brilliant achievements in their work. In the patriotic production increase movement, many labor models emerged, and more than 6,700 people were awarded labor medals in industry and transportation, including 28 who were awarded the titles of "Hero of the Republic" and "Labor Hero" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Fang Taiyu, the head of the delegation and chairman of the Korean Mining Workers' Union, first kindly told us about the heroic deeds of the miners. In the mines, a young jackhammer worker named Zhao Doushi was awarded the title of Labor Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for setting a new national mining record. Before the war, he produced an average of nine tons of ore in eight hours a day. In 1951, he achieved an average of 64 tons of ore in eight hours a day, which was more than six times the pre-war amount. In 1952, he reached an average of 75.5 tons per day, an increase of 18 percent over 1951. The main reason he was able to achieve such production was because he created the "segmented mining method" and the "parallel blasting method." This mining method can produce up to 240 tons per day. Now the government has promoted the adoption of this new mining method throughout the country. Many miners, such as Kim Chang-sun and Yoon Jung-ha, have achieved excellent results by learning this advanced mining method and have also been awarded the title of Labor Hero.
    After the outbreak of the Korean War, many young miners went to the front, but their jobs were immediately replaced by women and the elderly. The young female miner Kim Chun-hee took the place of her husband as a jackhammer worker in the mine after sending him to the front. She worked selflessly with the tools her husband left behind and studied the Zhao Doushi mining method, earning her the Labor Medal.
    In the arms factories, the workers put forward the slogan of sending the best quality weapons to the front to fight the enemy. The workers displayed a high degree of collectivism and launched a high-speed operation method and a waste utilization movement. In adopting the high-speed operation method, the excellent lathe operator Park Bong-woon group in an arms factory shortened the work that used to take 24 hours to complete to 12 hours. This group saved the factory 3,652 workdays in one year. In carrying out the waste utilization movement, a machine repairman, Cui Chengjun, repaired the ball bearings in the machine that could not be used in the past, which guaranteed the factory's production needs in a timely manner. Therefore, he was awarded the title of Labor Hero.
    In textile factories, workers proposed a movement to save every minute and second. The excellent female textile worker and labor hero Gao Young-sook produced 100,000 meters of cloth by December last year. She not only managed eight looms by herself, but also trained 50 female weavers, enabling a large number of female workers in the factory to master skilled techniques. In this way, their factory transferred 35 female workers to work in other textile factories. Gao Young-sook's advanced operating technique is mainly fast connection. In the past, it took others ten seconds to connect a thread, but she could connect it in five seconds. In a certain textile factory, there was a model female worker, Kim Bok-sil, who won the Labor Medal. She learned the Chinese Hao Jianxiu work method and still overfulfilled the plan last year under extremely difficult conditions.
    Railway transportation is an important front line that is directly engaged in a tense struggle with the American imperialist bandits. Here, too, many heroic labor models have emerged. The railway transportation labor hero Zheng Daoming is a good example. He often risked enemy bombing to accurately complete the tasks assigned to him by his superiors. Once, when he was ordered to transport a train of military supplies to the front, he encountered four enemy planes. He skillfully controlled the locomotive and cleverly avoided the enemy planes' bombing. Sometimes he accelerated the train and drove straight ahead, and sometimes he hid suddenly, and sometimes he closed the chimney of the train to prevent the enemy planes from finding the target. In this way, he fought tensely with the enemy for four hours at night, and finally bravely drove the train full of military supplies to the front.
    In 1952, in the tense days of the Korean War, the Korean national railway transportation gloriously fulfilled its plan. What a great victory this is.
    The two representatives told us that there are too many heroic struggles of the Korean working class in the days of war.
    Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people's leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean working class exerted great combat power, and in order to support the front line, everyone overcame all difficulties with selfless labor enthusiasm and completed arduous production tasks. The Korean Workers' Party also paid special attention to every worker in the war, encouraging the workers' production enthusiasm. The great support and assistance of the peaceful and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and the heroic joint combat of the Chinese People's Volunteers greatly encouraged the fighting Korean working class. Fang Taiyu, the head of the delegation, enthusiastically told the reporter about a vivid fact of the high degree of internationalist friendship displayed by the Chinese working class and the Korean working class on the Korean front. That was in May last year, in a certain mine in northern Korea, when the workers were short of food due to transportation difficulties, the Chinese railway workers living near the mine saved 15 sacks of food and immediately sent them to the Korean miners, their brothers. This high degree of friendship greatly encouraged the miners, and they were deeply moved by this great friendship. On the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight and the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, the Korean Federation of Trade Unions launched workers in various factories and mines to write letters of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteers and make condolence bags, which deepened the close fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
    This year, the production plan of various factories and mines in Korea has been increased compared with last year, but all the workers have great confidence in completing this production plan. The workers' production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. Here we can take the textile industry's labor hero Tang Yunshi as an example. She is already prepared to complete her personal production plan for 1953 by the end of May this year.
    Fang Taiyu told us that recently, Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Kim Il-sung's statement on the Korean armistice negotiations was warmly supported by the entire Korean working class. The Korean working class has always been fighting valiantly to defend peace and the motherland. However, every Korean worker has a high degree of vigilance. They do not think that peace can be easily obtained. They have the confidence to continue to smash any conspiracies and adventurous actions of the enemy and strive for the final victory of peace. Comrade Park Sam-ryun told us that in this exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, the Korean people once again saw with their own eyes how despicable and shameless the so-called "humanitarianism" of the American imperialist bandits is in treating prisoners of war! While peace talks are underway today, American imperialist planes are still bombing the rear of Korea madly and are still constantly shooting unarmed prisoners of war. These are the bloody facts that the Korean people have seen with their own eyes!
    When we talked to Fang Taiyu about his feelings about being invited to China to attend the May Day Labor Day celebrations and the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union, Fang Taiyu kindly told us that when he saw how the people under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong enthusiastically supported the Korean front in the struggle against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and how they were busy with construction, their confidence in the fight for peace was strengthened. He believes that in the future, the Korean working class and the Chinese working class will unite more closely in fighting friendship. He wanted us to convey his highest and warmest regards to the great Chinese parents who sent their excellent children to the Korean front to participate in the heroic battle.

    英勇战斗着的朝鲜工人阶级
    ——访朝鲜工会代表团
    本报记者　柏生
    五一节的前夕，我们访问了应邀来我国首都参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的朝鲜工会代表团团长、朝鲜矿山职业同盟委员长方泰郁和代表团团员、朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会工资部部长朴三润。
    从他们的谈话中，我看到了为保卫和平、保卫祖国而英勇战斗着的朝鲜工人阶级的英雄面貌。
    在反对美国侵略者的战争中，英勇的朝鲜工人阶级响应了金日成首相伟大的号召，在极艰难的条件下，献出了一切力量。他们以高度的劳动热情，卷入了爱国增产竞赛。虽然是在战争环境下，产量仍是逐年提高，一九五二年工业生产比一九五一年增加了百分之十九。许多工人在劳动中创造了光辉的勋绩。在爱国增产运动中，涌现出许多劳动模范，在产业和运输方面获得劳动勋章的有六千七百余名，其中荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“共和国英雄”和“劳动英雄”称号的有二十八名。方泰郁团长是朝鲜矿山职业同盟委员长，他首先亲切地把矿山工人的英雄事迹告诉了我们。在矿山中，一个叫做赵斗实的青年凿岩工，因为创造了全国采矿新纪录，荣膺了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动英雄的称号。他在战前平均一天八小时只生产九吨矿石，一九五一年他达到平均每天八小时产矿石六十四吨，即比战前增加了六倍以上；一九五二年更达到平均每天产七十五吨半，即比一九五一年又增加了百分之十八。他所以能达到这样的产量，主要是因为他创造了“分段式采矿法”和“平行式爆破法”。这种采矿法，一天产量最高能达到二百四十吨。现在政府已把他这种新式采矿法在全国推广采用。许多矿山工人如金昌善、尹正河等，因为学习了这种先进采矿法，创造了优越的成绩，同样地获得了劳动英雄的称号。
    在朝鲜战争爆发后，许多青年矿工走上了前线，但是他们的工作岗位立刻就被妇女和老年人代替了。年青的女矿工金春姬就是在送走了自己的丈夫上前线以后，代替自己的丈夫做了矿里的凿岩工的。她用丈夫留下的工具忘我地劳动着，并且学习了赵斗实采矿法，荣获了劳动勋章。
    在兵工厂里，工人们提出了要把质量最好的武器送到前线去打敌人的口号。工人们发挥了高度的集体主义精神，展开了高速度作业法和利用废品运动。在采用高速度作业法中，兵工厂的一个优秀的镟盘工朴凤运小组，把过去要用二十四小时完成的工作，缩短到用十二小时就能完成。他这个小组一年内就为工厂节约了三千六百五十二个工。在开展利用废品运动中，一个机器修理工崔成俊，利用机器中过去不能用的滚珠，把它修好，及时保证了工厂生产的需要。因此他获得了劳动英雄的称号。
    在纺织工厂中，工人们提出了节约一分一秒的运动。优秀的纺织女工、劳动英雄高英淑，去年到十二月时就已生产了布十万公尺。她不但一个人能管理八台织布机，并且还培养了五十名织布女工。使这个工厂大批的女工掌握了熟练的技术。这样，她们厂里就输送了三十五名女工，到别的纺织厂去工作。高英淑的先进操作技术主要是接线快，过去别人十秒钟接一个线头，她五秒钟就接好了。在某纺织工厂，有一个获得了劳动勋章的模范女工金福实，她学习了中国郝建秀工作法，在去年极困难的条件下，仍然超额完成了计划。
    铁路运输，更是直接和美帝国主义强盗进行紧张斗争的一条重要的战线。在这里同样地涌现了许多英勇的劳动模范。铁路运输劳动英雄郑道明就是很好的一个例子，他经常冒着敌机轰炸的危险，准确地完成上级交给他的任务。有一次当他奉命运了一列车军需品送往前线时，正好碰上了敌人的四架飞机，他熟练地掌握着机车，巧妙地躲避着敌机的轰炸。有时他把列车加足了马力直往前开，有时又忽而躲避起来，有时把火车的烟囱闭起，使敌机找不到目标。就这样在夜里和敌人一直紧张地战斗了四个小时，终于英勇地把满载军需品的列车开到了前线。
    一九五二年，在朝鲜战争紧张的日子里，朝鲜全国铁路运输仍然光荣地完成了计划。这是一个多么伟大的胜利。
    两位代表告诉我们，在战争的日子里，朝鲜工人阶级英勇斗争的事迹是太多了。
    在朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅的领导下，英雄的朝鲜工人阶级发挥了伟大的战斗力量，为了支援前线，每个人都以忘我的劳动热情，克服一切困难，完成着艰巨的生产任务。朝鲜劳动党在战争中也特别地关心着每一个工人，鼓舞着工人们的生产情绪。以苏联为首的和平民主国家对朝鲜人民的伟大支援、帮助，和中国人民志愿军的并肩英勇作战，使战斗的朝鲜工人阶级得到了莫大的鼓舞。方泰郁团长充满热情地对记者讲述了一个在朝鲜前线，中国工人阶级和朝鲜工人阶级发挥高度国际主义友爱的生动事实。那是去年的五月间，在朝鲜北部的某矿山，工人们因为运输困难，正缺乏粮食的时候，住在矿山附近的中国铁路工人节约了十五麻袋的粮食，立即送给了这个矿山的朝鲜矿工兄弟们。这种高度的友爱精神，大大地鼓舞了矿工们，他们为这伟大的友谊深深地感动着。在纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战二周年纪念日和朝鲜人民军建军五周年的时候，朝鲜职业总同盟发动各厂矿工人给中国人民志愿军写慰问信和做慰问袋，更加深了中朝人民亲密战斗的友谊。
    今年朝鲜各厂矿的生产计划比去年提高了，但所有的工人们都有很大的信心来完成这个生产计划。工人生产情绪的高涨是空前的。这里我们可以以纺织工业方面的劳动英雄唐云实为例，她已经准备把一九五三年个人生产计划提前在今年五月底就完成。
    方泰郁团长告诉我们，最近周恩来总理和金日成元帅关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明，受到了全朝鲜工人阶级的热烈拥护，朝鲜工人阶级一直是在为保卫和平、保卫祖国而英勇战斗着的。但是每一个朝鲜工人都有着高度的警惕，他们并不以为和平很容易就能够得到，他们有信心继续粉碎敌人的任何阴谋诡计和冒险行动，争取和平的最后胜利。朴三润同志告诉我们，在这次病伤战俘的交换过程中，朝鲜人民再一次亲眼看到了美帝国主义强盗对待战俘的所谓“人道主义”是怎样的卑鄙无耻！在今天正在进行恢复和平谈判的同时，美帝国主义的飞机仍旧在朝鲜后方疯狂地进行着轰炸，仍在不断地枪杀着手无寸铁的战俘，这是朝鲜人民亲眼看到的血腥事实！
    当我们和方泰郁团长谈起了这次他应邀来中国参加“五一”劳动节观礼和参加中国工会第七次全国代表大会的感想时，方泰郁团长亲切地告诉我们，当他看到伟大的毛泽东领导下的人民在抗美援朝的斗争中，怎样以高度的热情支援朝鲜前线的事实，和紧张地从事建设的情景时，他们为和平战斗的信心更加强了。他相信今后朝鲜工人阶级和中国工人阶级将会在战斗的友爱中团结得更加亲密。他要我们代他向把自己的优秀儿女送到朝鲜前线参加英勇战斗的伟大的中国父母亲们致最崇高和亲切的慰问。
