The Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Jacques Denis, and Secretary Namazi delivered reports on the two agenda items respectively. Denis's report pointed out that the news of the Third World Youth Congress has been widely responded to by young people, who are preparing for the congress in various ways. The recently held International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights played a significant role in the preparations for the congress. Denis then pointed out the tasks of the Federation's Secretariat and the national youth organizations that have joined the Federation in the preparations for the congress. He concluded by saying, "Let us gather the best youth representatives, the youth representatives who are fighting for peace and to satisfy their demands, to participate in this congress."

Namazi's report stated that young people all over the world welcome the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship. Young people are promoting the festival in a variety of ways, and the preparations for the festival demonstrate the strength of the youth's unity.

In a statement issued on the 19th, the Executive Committee said that the reports and extensive discussions at the Helsinki meeting showed that the youth of all countries unanimously and warmly welcome the World Youth Congress and the Festival. The Congress and the Festival are widely supported, and the preparations are being carried out so actively because the basic spirit of the Congress and the Festival—peace and friendship—is close and precious to every young person. The Executive Committee expressed its satisfaction with the preparations for the Congress and the Festival. The statement also said that the unity of youth is necessary and possible, and the Congress and the Festival provide good opportunities for the unity of youth.
