    Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic Republics Product Sample Exhibition Opens in Beijing
    [By Our Staff Reporter] The Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government began holding a product sample exhibition of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic Republics at the Friendship Hall of the Beijing Youth Palace on May 4th. The main contents of the exhibition are specifications and some samples of various machinery, instruments, hardware, steel, electrical and telecommunications equipment, chemical raw materials, and medical equipment.
    In the past, due to a lack of understanding of the production situation in the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic Republics, there was often great blindness in ordering goods from various countries. Some materials could have been ordered quickly, but because there was insufficient understanding of the other party's products, it was impossible to propose matching specifications and models, resulting in delays in signing contracts. This sample exhibition will greatly help various industrial and mining enterprises to understand the product situation of various fraternal countries, so that the needs of our economic construction can be connected with their supply work, which will powerfully promote the production and foreign trade work of both parties.
    The exhibition is scheduled to close on May 19th. (Qu Fengzhao)

    苏联及东欧人民民主国家产品样本展览会在京开幕
    【本报讯】中央对外贸易部从五月四日开始在北京青年宫交谊厅举办苏联及东欧各人民民主国家产品样本展览会。展览会的主要内容为各种机械、仪器、五金钢材、电工电讯器材、化工原料及医疗器材等类产品的规格说明书和部分样品。
    过去由于对苏联及各人民民主国家的生产情况缺乏了解，在向各国订货时，常常有很大的盲目性。有的物资本来可以很快订妥，因为对对方产品情况了解不够，提不出相符的规格、型号，结果拖延了签订合同的时间。这次样品展览会，将大大帮助各工矿企业部门对各兄弟国家产品情况的了解，使我们经济建设方面的需要与他们的供应工作衔接起来，这将有力地推进双方的生产与对外贸易工作。
    展览会定五月十九日闭幕。    （曲凤沼）
