Xinhua News Agency, Dateline Moscow, 10th: Increasing numbers of important British working-class organizations and prominent leaders of the labor movement are announcing their support for peace in Korea and overall peace measures. The Amalgamated Engineering Union, holding its annual meeting in Eastbourne, decided to telegraph British Prime Minister Churchill, the US Ambassador to London, and the UN Secretary-General, urging them to exert every effort to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Korea and "prevent any possibility of the negotiations breaking down again."

    Jack Tanner, President of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, said that the emergency resolution on this issue not only represents the views of the 880,000 members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, but also the views of workers in Britain and around the world.

    The Foundry Workers' Union has included eight proposals calling for peace in Korea on its agenda, which was announced on May 8th. One of the proposals calls for "the British government to change its policy of following the United States" and to "strongly oppose the US attempt to expand the war to China."

    Four British trade union leaders have called on union members to attend the "Action for Peace" conference in Manchester next weekend. They are: Jim Brett Figgins, who has just resigned as General Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, Mick McGahey, President of the Foundry Workers' Union, Belcher, General Secretary of the Tobacco Workers' Union, and John Burns, Chairman of the Fire Brigades Union.

    The call issued by the four leaders points out that numerous resolutions passed by millions of union members call for trade between East and West, comprehensive arms reduction, and a meeting of the five major powers. The call states: "We must take action to make the resolutions we support a reality. We must launch the most powerful joint action for peace this country has ever seen, uniting workers from all industries and people of all parties and beliefs. Let us come together to discuss ways to take immediate concerted action to ensure an end to the Korean War, lasting peace in Asia and Europe, and that all future international disputes are resolved through negotiation rather than by force."

    Xinhua News Agency, 9th: British and Australian public opinion continues to criticize the overbearing attitude of Harrison, the chief US representative at the Korean armistice negotiations.

    London dispatch: The "Manchester Guardian" published a dispatch on May 7th entitled "General Harrison's Error – Knowing Only How Not to Negotiate." The dispatch said, "General Harrison continues to show surprisingly how not to negotiate. His recent actions are particularly perplexing. He is clearly and earnestly demanding that North Korean prisoners of war should be released within South Korean territory... Did he really think that the Communists would accept this method? If he thought so, he is rather simple-minded. If he didn't think so, then why make such a request?" Because the US side is hindering the smooth progress of the negotiations, the "Manchester Guardian" suggests that the negotiations be moved out of the "unfavorable environment" of Korea to another location, so that the United States can be forced to "negotiate according to diplomatic conventions."

    Another dispatch from Sydney reports that the "Sydney Morning Herald" criticized Harrison on May 7th, saying that it is difficult to say that Harrison's attitude has "the sincerity to seek a quick solution." The "Sydney Morning Herald" rebuked Harrison for attending the meeting with the attitude that negotiations were doomed to fail, and his negotiating method was "in the nature of an ultimatum." The newspaper believes that Harrison's "uncompromising" attitude is "completely inexplicable and inappropriate." The newspaper concluded: "If Harrison does not bluff and say nonsense that prisoners of war would rather commit suicide than leave Korea, but negotiates, then it is not difficult to find a compromise."

    英国混合机器工会等要求在朝鲜实现和平
    英澳报纸抨击哈利逊在谈判中横蛮无理的态度
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社伦敦十日讯：重要的英国工人阶级组织和著名的工人运动领袖愈来愈多地宣布他们支持在朝鲜实现和平及总的和平措置。正在东培恩举行年会的混合机器工会，决定要打电报给英国首相邱吉尔、美国驻伦敦大使和联合国秘书长，要求他们尽力使朝鲜立刻达成停战，“防止谈判再度破裂的任何可能性”。
    混合机器工会主席杰克·唐纳说，关于这个问题的紧急决议，不仅是代表了混合机器工会八十八万会员的意见，也代表了英国和世界各国工人的意见。
    翻砂工人联合会把八个要求在朝鲜实现和平的提案，列入了它在五月八日公布的议程里。其中一个提案要求“英国政府改变它追随美国的政策”，并“极力反对美国把战争扩大到中国的企图”。
    四位英国工会领袖已号召工会会员们参加下周末在曼彻斯特举行的以行动争取和平的大会。他们是：刚刚辞去全国铁路工人工会总书记职务的吉姆·布·费金斯、翻砂工人联合会主席麦克杜加尔、烟草工人工会总书记贝尔彻和救火员工会主席约翰·伯恩斯。
    四位领袖发出的号召指出，千百万工会会员们通过的许多决议要求东西方进行贸易、全面削减军备和五大国召开会议。号召说：“我们必须采取行动使得我们所支持的决议实现。我们必须展开这个国家从来没有见过的最强大的争取和平的联合行动，团结各行业的工人和各个党派各种信仰的人们。让我们一起来讨论办法，以便立即采取一致行动，保证停止朝鲜战争、在亚洲和欧洲实现持久和平以及今后所有国际纠纷都用谈判的方法而不用武力来解决。”
    【新华社九日讯】英国和澳大利亚的舆论继续抨击朝鲜停战谈判美方首席代表哈利逊在谈判中蛮横无理的态度。
    伦敦消息：“曼彻斯特卫报”在五月七日发表了一篇通讯，题为“哈利逊将军的错误——只知如何不进行谈判”。通讯说，“哈利逊将军继续令人惊奇地表现了如何不进行谈判。他最近的行动是特别使人费解的。他很明显地、认真地要求北朝鲜战俘应该在南朝鲜境内释放……他曾经真正想到共产党人会接受这个办法吗？如果他是这样想，他是头脑相当简单的。如果他不是这样想，那么，为什么要提出这种要求呢？”因为美方使谈判的顺利进行受到障碍，“曼彻斯特卫报”建议使谈判脱离朝鲜的“恶劣环境”，移到别处去进行，这样才可以迫使美国“根据外交习惯来进行谈判”。
    另据悉尼消息，“悉尼先锋晨报”在五月七日抨击哈利逊说，很难说哈利逊的态度具有“迅速谋求解决的诚意”。“悉尼先锋晨报”斥责哈利逊是抱着谈判注定要失败的态度出席会议的，他的谈判方法是“最后通牒性质的”。该报认为，哈利逊这种“毫不让步”的态度“完全是令人莫名其妙和不适当的”。报纸最后说：“如果哈利逊不虚张声势，不说什么战俘宁愿自杀也不愿离开朝鲜的胡说八道的话，而是进行谈判，那末寻找一个妥协办法是不困难的。”
