Korean Orphans Living Happily in China
陶学谦

    A touching photograph is before your eyes: A Korean orphan living a happy life in China is held tightly by Jin Zhenwu, a volunteer soldier returning home for recuperation. The child waves a wooden toy in his right hand and touches Jin Zhenwu's collar with his left. From the child's innocent expression and Jin Zhenwu's irrepressible smile, you can feel how excited and happy they are! Originally, it wasn't easy for this little life to survive until now; and Jin Zhenwu, for the sake of the Korean children, also shed a lot of blood. Today, they have met again on Chinese soil, how can they not be excited and happy!

    This child's name is Kim Jang-kun, born into a poor peasant family in Sinchon County, Hwanghae Province. His father, Kim Hyo-se, was the branch secretary of the Workers' Party's village committee. The year Kim Jang-kun was born was the first year of Korea's liberation. His family had been emancipated and added a child, a double blessing! However, the happy life did not last long. The American imperialist's war of aggression brought disaster to his entire family. After his hometown was temporarily occupied by the enemy, this innocent child, his parents, and his fellow villagers were imprisoned in a concentration camp. Later, when our army counterattacked and approached Sinchon County, the enemy, in a panic, threw a row of grenades into this concentration camp. Kim Jang-kun's parents and many villagers were sacrificed in this way, and he himself was rescued from the pool of blood. Now, Kim Jang-kun and more than 20,000 Korean orphans with similar experiences have come to our country.

    Peaceful and happy China has received these homeless children with great sympathy and unparalleled care.

    These orphans who have lost their parents are treated with parental love here, these children who have left their motherland feel the same warmth as in their motherland, and live a happy and peaceful life.

    In Jinxi County, on a piece of land of about one hundred square meters, several renovated houses are arranged. People can tell at a glance that this is the best residence in the whole city. This is the site of the Jinxi Loving Care Home. Kim Jang-kun and more than 330 other Korean orphans live here. The Loving Care Home has prepared bedrooms, tailoring rooms, laundry rooms, barber shops, toy rooms, bathrooms... Every bedroom is furnished according to their living habits, which makes you feel that these children live here just like they lived in their own country before the war. The cooks prepare nutritious meals for the children according to the weekly "nutrition schedule," and they can eat chicken, fish, sweets, and all kinds of fresh vegetables every day. The Chinese staff here all regard doing a good job in raising children as a practical action to resist America and aid Korea. Cook Lao Tian told me: "Cooking for these children is as energetic as raising my own children!" The nannies built a garden for planting vegetables in a sunny place for the children and let the children water them every day to cultivate their labor habits. In the evening, after the nannies bathe each child, they arrange for the children to sleep, humming lullabies and patiently coaxing them until they fall asleep peacefully.

    In western Liaoning, we also visited the first Korean elementary school in Xingcheng County. When we arrived there, the children were singing and dancing in the spacious playground. As soon as they saw us coming in, they swarmed around us. The older children shook hands with us kindly, and the younger ones chirped "Hello, Uncle!" and stretched out their small hands for us to hold. When we held them in our arms and kissed their apple-like little faces, the children sang "The East is Red, the sun rises..." in unison. Dean Kim Doo-il told us: "The children are living very well here. They live in warm houses and eat the special grade rice given to us by the Chinese government. We watched them recover their health and gradually get fat. The weight of more than 400 Korean children here has increased by an average of more than five kilograms in four months. The older children have now entered normal school life."

    With the sound of the bell, we followed the children into a classroom. The classroom was large and bright. The snow-white walls were covered with Korean educational charts and pictures drawn by the students themselves, as well as their own compositions and wall newspapers. On the front wall of the classroom hung portraits of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong. The children sat quietly at new desks in the classroom, listening to the teachers' lectures.

    A Korean geography class was being taught in this classroom. Teacher Zhao Eun-hae drew a rough map of the Korean territory on the blackboard, prominently marking the location of "Mount Kumgang" on the map. The teacher carefully told the children everything about this famous Korean mountain: the dense forests, the magnificent waterfalls, the quiet sanatoriums, and the schools and kindergartens... "But," the teacher concluded, "these have all been destroyed by American planes. You must always remember this hatred!" Every word of the teacher aroused the children's love for their motherland and hatred for the enemy. Ding Yong-seop, a sixteen-year-old Korean Young Pioneer, had participated in four battles with the Korean People's Army, and he had killed two American soldiers and one Syngman Rhee puppet soldier with a People's Army soldier. Now he still has six scars on his body. He is determined to study hard and become an air force soldier of the people to defend his country in the future.

    In the fifth-grade classroom, art was being taught. The children were all carefully drawing. The art teacher told me that the children wanted to send this work to the volunteer soldiers recuperating nearby. Kwon Bok-gil, a learning model who often gets full marks and the vice-chairman of the Young Pioneers, drew a portrait of a Chinese People's Volunteer soldier struggling in the deep water, using both hands to lift a Korean child out of the ice. He wrote next to the painting, "We will always remember Uncle Luo Shengjiao in our hearts!"

    Yes, the children will always remember Luo Shengjiao and the volunteer soldiers. People tell me that these children often bring their own letters of condolences and some precious gifts to comfort the volunteer recuperators stationed nearby. They all consider it their greatest honor to sing a beautiful song and dance a good dance for the volunteer soldiers. Once, a twelve-year-old Korean child, Fang Yunlong, told Hou Yusheng, a volunteer soldier lying in bed, with great interest about his life in China: "...Look, my weight has increased by twenty-four pounds!" Saying that, he took out an apple from his pocket and handed it to Hou Yusheng, and continued, "This was given to us by the Chinese government during the Spring Festival, and I also received a lot. I will give this one to you, Uncle!" Hou Yusheng smiled, took a handful of candy from the drawer of the table next to the bed, put it in the child's pocket, and kindly instructed him: "Study hard here, and when you grow up, go back to build your country."

    The Chinese children living in Xingcheng have also established close friendships with these Korean children. At the founding meeting of the Korean Young Pioneers, the Chinese children gave their most beloved red scarves to Ahn Kwang-young, the Young Pioneer instructor, congratulating them on re-establishing their organization on the happy land of China. Ahn Kwang-young carefully preserved it and only took it out to wear it during Young Pioneer Day or when Chinese and Korean children held joint celebrations. Chinese children often chat, sing, dance, and watch plays with Korean children in the "Young Pioneer Club"... They learn Korean folk songs and dances, and also teach Korean children Chinese folk art. They all like to use their most beloved things as gifts to each other. These gifts include: photos of Chairman Mao and Marshal Kim Il-sung, notebooks, Chinese landscape paintings, paintings of the heroic struggle of the Korean people, and paintings of the happy life of Chinese children. Li Zhenquan, a member of the Young Pioneers of the No. 1 Complete Elementary School in Xingcheng, suddenly took out a pen from his pocket and handed it to Park Byung-kyu, a Korean child who was playing with him, and said naively, "I'll give it to you. Use this pen to write down all the crimes of American imperialism. Let this be a permanent souvenir of our friendship!" Their feelings are intertwined in this way, and they live like biological brothers and sisters on the happy land of China.

    Now, I have parted ways with these children. But their innocent and lively appearance and their sincere feelings of love and hate still remain in my memory. Mao Zedong's brilliance shines on and warms these Korean orphans who are far away from their motherland. These descendants of heroic Korea will surely grow up and, like their parents, bravely and diligently defend their motherland and build their motherland. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜孤儿们在中国幸福地生活着
    陶学谦
    一张动人的照片摆在你的眼前：一个生活在幸福的中国的朝鲜孤儿，被志愿军归国休养员金镇武紧紧抱起，孩子右手挥舞着一支木制的玩具，左手抚摸着金镇武的衣领。从孩子的天真的表情和金镇武的抑不住的微笑里，你可以感觉到他们是多么地兴奋和愉快！本来，这个小生命能活到现在是不容易的；而金镇武呢，他为了朝鲜的孩子，也流了不少的鲜血。今天，他们又在中国的土地上见了面，怎能不兴奋，不愉快呢！
    这个孩子的名字叫金将君，出生在黄海道信川郡的一个贫农家里。父亲叫金晓世，是劳动党里委员会的支部书记。金将君出生那年，正是朝鲜解放的第一个年头，他家翻了身，又添了个孩子，双喜临门，全家多么高兴啊！可是，幸福的生活没过多久，美帝国主义发动的侵略战争又给他们全家带来了灾难。他的家乡被敌人暂时占据后，这个无辜的孩子和他的父母以及乡亲们都被敌人囚禁在一个集中营里。后来我军反攻逼近信川郡，敌人在狼狈逃窜时，把一排子手榴弹抛掷在这个集中营里，金将君的父母就这样地和许多乡亲们一起牺牲了，而他自己却从血泊中被抢救了出来。现在，金将君和两万多个类似他的遭遇的朝鲜孤儿一起来到了我们的国家里。
    和平幸福的中国用极大的同情和无比的关怀接待了这批无家可归的孩子们。
    这些失掉了父母的孤儿，在这里受到父母般的疼爱，这些离开了祖国的孩子，在这里同样感到祖国一样的温暖，过着幸福而又愉快的和平生活。
    在锦西县城里一块大约一百平方公尺的土地上，排列着几幢经过整修的房子。人们一眼可以看得出来，这是全城里最好的住所。这就是锦西爱育院的院址。金将君和其他三百三十多个朝鲜孤儿就生活在这里。爱育院给他们准备了寝室、裁缝室、洗衣室、理发室、玩具室、沐浴室……。每一个寝室里都是按照他们的生活习惯而摆设的，这使你感到，这些孩子生活在这里，就和战前生活在他们自己的祖国里一样。炊事员同志按着每周的“营养调配表”给孩子们准备了富有营养的饭菜，他们每天都可以吃到鸡、鱼、糖果和各种新鲜的蔬菜。这里的中国职工都把做好抚养孩子的工作当做是抗美援朝的实际行动。炊事员老田告诉我：“给这些孩子们做饭，就像拉扯自己孩子一样的有劲！”褓姆们在阳光充足的地方，给孩子们修筑了一个栽种蔬菜的园子，每天让孩子们自己往上面洒水，培养他们的劳动习惯。晚上，褓姆给每个孩子洗过澡以后，就安排孩子们睡觉，褓姆的嘴里不断哼着催眠曲，耐心地哄着他们，直到他们安祥地入睡。
    在辽西，我们又访问了兴城县的朝鲜第一初等学院。到那里时，孩子们正在宽敞的运动场上唱歌跳舞。一看到我们进来，他们就一哄围拢过来。大一点的孩子亲切地和我们握手，小一点的就吱吱呀呀地叫“叔叔好！”小手伸过来让我们抱。当我们把他们抱在怀里，亲亲他们那些苹果似的小脸时，孩子们就不约而同地唱起“东方红，太阳升……”。金斗溢院长这样告诉我们：“孩子们在这里生活得很好。他们住着暖和的房子，吃着中国政府给我们的特等大米，我们眼看着他们恢复了健康，渐渐地胖了起来。这里的四百多个朝鲜孩子，在四个月中平均每人的体重就增加了五公斤以上。大一点的孩子现在已进入正常的学校生活了。”
    随着铃声，我们跟着孩子走进了一个教室。教室宽大明亮。雪白的墙壁上布满了朝鲜文的教育挂图和学生们自己画的图画，还有他们自己的作文和墙报。教室的正面墙上挂着金日成元帅和毛泽东主席的像片。孩子们都安静地坐在教室里新制的书桌前，听着教师们讲课。
    这个教室里正在上朝鲜地理课。教员赵银海在黑板上画出了朝鲜国土的略图，在图上突出地标出了
    “金刚山”的位置。老师细心地给孩子们讲着这座朝鲜名山的一切：丛密的树林，壮丽的瀑布，安静的疗养院，还有学校和幼儿园……“可是，”老师最后说：“这些都被美国飞机炸毁了。你们要永远记着这仇恨！”老师的每一句话，都唤起孩子们对祖国的热爱和对敌人的仇恨。丁永燮是一个十六岁的朝鲜少年团员，他曾经跟着朝鲜人民军参加过四次战斗，他还曾经和一个人民军战士一块打死了两个美国兵和一个李承晚伪军士兵，现在他身上还留着六处伤痕。他下定决心好好学习，将来做一个人民的空军战士，保卫自己的祖国。
    五年级的课堂上正在上美术。孩子们都在精心地画着。美术老师告诉我：孩子们都想把这一次的作品，送给在附近休养的志愿军同志。经常获得满分的学习模范权福吉，是少年团的副团长，他画了一个中国人民志愿军战士的像，在深水里挣扎着用双手把一个朝鲜小孩捧出冰层，他在画旁写着“我们心里永远记着罗盛教叔叔！”
    是的，孩子们会永远记着罗盛教，记着志愿军的。人们告诉我：这些孩子经常带着自己写的慰问信和一些珍贵礼品，去慰问驻在附近的志愿军休养员。他们都以能给志愿军叔叔唱一个动听的歌，跳一个好看的舞为最大荣誉。有一次，一个十二岁的朝鲜孩子方云龙，很有兴趣地给躺在病床上的志愿军伤员侯玉生讲述自己在中国的生活情形：“……看，我的体重已经增加了二十四斤！”说着，他从口袋里掏出来一个苹果递给侯玉生，继续说：“这是春节时中国政府送给我们的，我也分到了很多，这一个送给叔叔吃！”侯玉生笑着，从病床旁边桌子的抽屉里拿出来一把糖，装进孩子的口袋里，并且亲切地嘱托他：“在这里好好地学习吧，大了好回去建设你们的国家。”
    住在兴城的中国儿童，也和这些朝鲜孩子建立了亲密的友谊。在朝鲜少年团成立大会上，中国的孩子们把自己最心爱的红领巾赠给了少年团指导员安光滢，祝贺他们在幸福的中国土地上重新建立了自己的组织。安光滢把它细心地保存起来，每逢过团日或中朝的孩子开联欢会时，才拿出来带上。中国儿童常常在“少年团俱乐部”里，和朝鲜孩子一起谈心、唱歌、跳舞、看戏……。他们学习着朝鲜的民族歌舞，也教朝鲜孩子学习中国的民族艺术。他们都喜欢把自己最心爱的东西做为相互赠送的礼品。在这些礼品中有：毛主席和金日成元帅的照片、笔记本、中国风景画片、朝鲜人民英勇斗争的画片、中国儿童的幸福生活画片等。兴城第一完全小学校少年儿童队队员李振全，在一次和朝鲜孩子玩到最有兴趣的时候，突然从袋子里拿出了一支钢笔，递给和他一块玩的朝鲜孩子朴秉球，天真地说：“送给你，用这支笔把美帝国主义的罪恶全写下来。这就算是我们做朋友的永久留念吧！”他们的感情就是这样地交织在一块，他们就像亲生的兄弟姊妹一样地生活在幸福的中国土地上。
    现在，我和这些孩子分别了。可是他们那种天真活泼的样子和爱憎分明的诚挚的感情，直到现在还留在我的记忆里。毛泽东的光辉照耀着、温暖着这些远离祖国的朝鲜孤儿们。这些英雄的朝鲜的后代，将来长大了，一定会和他们的父母亲一样，勇敢勤劳地悍卫自己的祖国，建设自己的祖国。（附图片）
