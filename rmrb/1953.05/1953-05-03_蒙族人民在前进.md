The Mongolian People Are Advancing
Mao Aohai
Editor's Note: This May 1st marks the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The various works of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved brilliant successes in the past six years, becoming a good example of minority nationality regional autonomy. The following article introduces in detail the happy life of the Mongolian nationality and the Mongolian people in various regions after liberation.

The Mongolian nationality is one of the outstanding nationalities of our great motherland, and it is one of the more populous nationalities in our country, with a total of more than 1.7 million people. The Mongolian people initially lived scattered in the vast area south of Lake Baikal and north of the Gobi Desert, leading a nomadic life. Since Genghis Khan unified the Mongolian tribes in the early 13th century, the Mongolian people have been known to the world as a great and powerful nation. The Mongolian distribution area is very wide, North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are the main areas where the Mongolian people live; the provinces of Rehe, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, and Jilin in the Northeast region and the provinces of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Gansu in the Northwest region also have many Mongolian people living in concentrated and mixed communities; there are also a few scattered Mongolian people in the Southwest, Central South, and East China regions.

The Mongolian inhabited areas of Inner Mongolia, North China, and Northwest China are vast, with dense forests, vast grasslands, and fertile land, producing large quantities of wood, fur, and grain, and underground reserves of gold, iron, coal, salt, alkali, mica, asbestos, and other minerals.

The Mongolian people have their own common language and writing—Mongolian and Mongolian script. The Mongolian language has a unique grammatical structure and basic vocabulary, belonging to the Mongolian language family of the Altaic language system. The Mongolian language in ancient times was very much like poetry in four- or six-character phrases, melodious and pleasant to listen to. This language has been maintained in pastoral areas in recent years. The Mongolian script was created during the Kublai Khan era of the Yuan Dynasty and is mainly composed of phonetic letters and individual monosyllabic letters, which are easy to learn and remember. It is quite common for Mongolians to know Mongolian script. Mongolian script is commonly used in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and in Mongolian-distributed areas such as Northeast, North China, Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai. The Mongolian script used by the old and new Torgut Mongolians in Xinjiang has slightly different letters and pronunciations and is only used in the Mongolian-inhabited areas of Xinjiang. The Mongolian people used Mongolian script to implement administrative orders, record historical events, translate classics, and write literature very early on.

Lamaism was extremely popular in the Mongolian region during the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and the Mongolian people living in various regions of the Northwest and a part of the Mongolian people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region still believe in Lamaism.

The Mongolian people are brave and good at riding horses. They can ride hundreds of miles a day, and children as young as six or seven can ride horses. The Mongolian people love to sing and are good at singing. Generally, men and women can compose and sing their own songs. During grassland temple fairs, Nadaam festivals, slack farming seasons, or New Year festivals, Mongolians often gather together to sing, tell stories, and recite poems. The content of their performances is mostly historical legends and heroic figures passed down from generation to generation.

The Mongolian people mostly engage in agriculture and animal husbandry. Growing grains and raising livestock are their main production. Regionally speaking: the agricultural population of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is larger than the pastoral population; however, the area of ​​the pastoral area is large, accounting for about three-quarters of the total area of ​​the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Mongolian people in the Northeast region mainly engage in agriculture, and very few engage in animal husbandry. The Mongolian people in North China and Northwest China mainly engage in animal husbandry, and very few engage in agriculture. The Mongolian people in other regions mainly engage in agriculture. The agricultural economic situation of the Mongolian people is mostly similar to that of the Han people in the Northeast region. They mostly live on flat ground, cultivate dry land, and have relatively complete production tools. The social and economic situation of the pastoral area is completely different from that of the Han people. The Mongolian people in the pastoral area mostly choose grasslands and mountain slopes to build yurts to live in, specializing in raising livestock and grazing along the water and grass according to the climate of the four seasons. However, some Mongolian herdsmen have now begun to settle down.

The Mongolian nationality has had many great historical facts of anti-aggression and anti-oppression struggles, and many heroic figures have emerged. During the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the Mongolian people carried out many heroic struggles against national oppression, among which the famous ones were the struggles of Lindan Khan [Note 1] and Galdan [Note 2]. The anti-Manchu war led by Galdan lasted for seven years from 1690. During the period of the Northern Warlords, the anti-warlord struggle of Gada Meilin [Note 3] broke out in Eastern Mongolia. This struggle not only hit the warlords' ambition to plunder the wealth of the Mongolian people, but also shattered the conspiracy of the reactionary princes within the Mongolian people to sell out national interests. Gada Meilin always persisted in the struggle on the battlefield and in the enemy's prison, maintaining national integrity. In 1924, a large number of Mongolian youths from the Mongolian-Tibetan School in Beijing joined the organization of the Chinese Communist Party. Ulanhu, the current chairman of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was an outstanding Mongolian youth who joined the Party organization at the school at that time. These advanced Mongolian youths widely spread Marxism-Leninism and the truth of the Chinese revolution in the Mongolian region, sowing the seeds of revolution. During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Mongolian people opened up revolutionary work in the Rehe-Suiyuan-Chahar area and established a revolutionary national armed force. Comrade Li Yuzhi [Note 4], one of the leaders of the Mongolian revolutionary armed forces who died heroically at that time, was an excellent son of the Mongolian people. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Mongolian people's revolutionary struggle went underground and persisted under extremely difficult circumstances. In 1937, when the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, the Mongolian people and the Eighth Route Army carried out anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare and established the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese Government and Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Team. During the Liberation War, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Mongolian people established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation headed by Ulanhu, carried out the national regional autonomy movement, and established the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Armed Forces, cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to drive the Kuomintang reactionaries out of the Inner Mongolia region. These historical facts prove that the Mongolian nationality is a nationality with a glorious revolutionary tradition of heroic struggle. Although the Mongolian people suffered all kinds of discrimination, insults, exploitation, and slaughter under the cruel oppression of successive reactionary rules, they never stopped their struggle and finally achieved final victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

After liberation, under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy, the Mongolian people have been emancipated politically, economically, and culturally. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government Committee both have Mongolian representatives serving as members. According to the national regional autonomy policy of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, autonomous region people's governments have been established in the Mongolian-inhabited areas, among which the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established earlier and developed faster.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established on May 1, 1947, and is an autonomous region people's government equivalent to a large administrative region. In these six years, the region's political, economic, and cultural aspects have developed greatly. People's representative conferences at all levels have been convened throughout the region. Five banners have exercised the functions and powers of people's congresses. More than 90% of the gacha (villages) in the region have implemented democratic elections. The land reform was completed in the agricultural area in 1948, followed by a large-scale production movement. Now more than 70% of the rural labor force in the region has been organized, and 15 agricultural production cooperatives have been established on a trial basis. Agricultural production has increased year by year. In 1952, the total grain output of the autonomous region exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by more than 25%. In the pastoral areas, feudal privileges have also been abolished, necessary democratic reforms have been carried out, and the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class differentiation" and "free grazing, protecting livestock and increasing livestock" has been implemented. The Mongolian people's livestock has also increased year by year. The current number of livestock has doubled compared with 1947. The forest logging industry is the largest enterprise in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Due to reasonable logging, the logging plan has been overfulfilled. While logging in large quantities, attention has also been paid to seedling cultivation and afforestation. In the past three years, 7,858 hectares of afforestation plans have been completed. Due to the development of trade and cooperation, the old relationship of urban-rural opposition and agricultural-pastoral contradictions has been transformed into a new relationship of urban-rural mutual assistance and agricultural-pastoral unity. There are now 171 state-owned trading institutions and more than 690 cooperative grassroots societies. Inner Mongolia had no industry in the past. After the establishment of the autonomous region people's government, industry has begun to develop. There are now more than 50 factories of various sizes, and larger and more factories are being designed and built. Due to the development of various production undertakings, the lives of the Mongolian people have been greatly improved. The average purchasing power per person in 1951 increased by 37.42% compared with 1947, and even more in 1952. With the improvement of the autonomous region's financial situation and the general improvement of people's lives, cultural and educational undertakings have also developed greatly. In 1947, there were only 843 primary schools in the region. By the end of 1951, it had developed to 3,774, and it increased by more than 12% in 1952 compared with 1950. The number of children enrolled in school now accounts for 64% of school-age children, and the number of primary schools and students in the pastoral areas, where education was relatively backward in the past, has also doubled. There are 12 middle schools, and the number of middle school students has increased sixfold compared with the past. In addition, there are specialized schools such as normal schools, forestry schools, commercial schools, health schools, and animal husbandry and veterinary schools. The Inner Mongolia University, which is being designed, will also be established soon. Mongolian primary schools in the autonomous region use their own national language for teaching, and some courses in middle schools are also taught in Mongolian. From 1949 to 1952, a total of 330 kinds of Mongolian books and periodicals were published, totaling more than 1,942,000 copies. The single-volume edition of the first volume of the Mongolian "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has also been published in its entirety. Other cultural and artistic undertakings have also developed greatly. There are currently five cultural troupes and teams in the autonomous region, with Mongolians accounting for more than 58% of the cultural workers. Cinemas and cultural centers have been established in larger towns, and there are 11 film projection teams that regularly tour rural areas and grasslands to perform. In the past six years, many excellent literary and artistic works with national forms have emerged, many of which are works by Mongolian people from worker, peasant, soldier, and herdsman backgrounds. Maraqin’s novel "The People of the Horqin Grassland" and Meiliqige's poem "Raise a Glass to Bless Chairman Mao" have been welcomed by the broad masses of people across the country. A large number of Mongolian literary works including novels, newsletters, kuaiban, poems, songs, and scripts have also appeared, among which 31 famous works have been rewarded by the People's Government. The autonomous region's health care has also been continuously developing. The mortality rate of Mongolian infants has been greatly reduced. The Mongolian population in the pastoral area has stopped declining and has turned to rising. Now each banner and county has generally established health centers, and 178 Nutuk (districts) have established health clinics. Sexually transmitted diseases, which have been the most painful problem for the Mongolian people in the pastoral area for many years, have stopped spreading.

In the Mongolian-inhabited areas of North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, there have also been significant developments in various aspects after liberation.

There are approximately 170,000 Mongolians in North China, of which approximately 160,000 live in Suiyuan Province. The rest are scattered in Shanxi and Hebei provinces and Beijing. After the liberation of Suiyuan in 1949, two autonomous regions at the special district level were established in Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League; the Central Banner People's Government was established in the four banners of Eastern Suiyuan. Under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, land reform was implemented in the agricultural area, and the Mongolian people were divided into land and means of production. In the pastoral area, feudal privileges were abolished, and the policy of "no struggle, no division, protecting livestock and increasing livestock" was implemented. Veterinary epidemic prevention stations and veterinary clinics were established with emphasis in each banner and district. As a result, livestock has increased year by year: for example, livestock in Yikezhao League increased by nearly one-third in 1952 compared with 1951, and livestock in some areas of Ulanqab League increased by one to three times in 1952 compared with 1950. Now the pastoral area has begun to use Soviet Kabajin horses for breeding with emphasis, and is preparing to sow pasture grass with emphasis, so that herdsmen can gradually move from nomadic to settled life and further develop animal husbandry production. Due to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, the purchasing power of the Mongolian people in 1952 increased by 164% compared with before liberation. Before liberation, there was not a single school in the grassland of Yikezhao League. Now, on average, each banner and district has at least one primary school. After liberation, more than 300 primary schools were added throughout the league, and a middle school was also established. Every yurt now has literacy textbooks, and it has become a habit for male and female herdsmen to learn to read while grazing. Reading groups and literacy classes have also been organized in lama temples. Mongolian primary schools use their own national language for classes, and Mongolian middle schools also have Mongolian classes. Health care has also developed significantly. Taking Ulanqab League as an example, there was not a single health care institution in the entire league in the past. Now the league and banners have established six health centers, seven health clinics in the districts, and two health care stations. In addition, 107 midwives have been trained. As a result, the trend of declining population year by year in the past has stopped, and the population in some areas has begun to rise. Historically, Suiyuan was the area with the most and more serious disputes between the Mongolian and Han nationalities, but after liberation, due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, the estrangement and hatred between the Mongolian and Han people were completely eliminated, and a new ethnic relationship of equality, mutual assistance, friendship, and unity was established. Countless mutually-aid groups organized jointly by the Mongolian and Han people who are closely united have now emerged.

There are approximately 450,000 Mongolian people in the Northeast region, of which approximately 270,000 are distributed in Rehe Province and approximately 110,000 in Liaoxi Province. The rest live in concentrated or mixed communities in the Mongolian banners of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and are scattered in Shenyang City and Songjiang Province. The people's democratic power has been established and consolidated in the Mongolian areas of the Northeast. Since 1949, the people's representative conferences at all levels of the Mongolian banners have become a regular system. Most of the cadres and people's representatives in the Mongolian areas are Mongolian people. There are currently 2,244 Mongolian cadres in the region. National regional autonomy and national democratic coalition governments will be generally established in 1953. During the land reform, the Mongolian people in the Northeast region were divided into land, livestock, houses, and means of production in the same way as the Han people. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Mongolian agricultural economy has been greatly restored and developed. Taking Durbert Banner in Heilongjiang Province as an example, among the 2,256 Mongolian households in the banner, 1,804 households are living a middle-peasant life, accounting for 80% of the total number of households. The pastoral area is mainly in Ongniud Banner in Rehe Province. Now the number of livestock in the pastoral area has increased by 25% compared with 1943, especially the cattle, which are the main source of livelihood for herdsmen, have exceeded the highest level of the puppet Manchukuo by 50%. Herdsmen have completely changed the past plight of wearing tattered leather robes with the fur facing inward in winter and the fur facing outward in summer all year round. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives have also been generally established in the Mongolian banners. In the four banners of Aohan, Ongniud, Harqin, and Harqin Left in Rehe Province alone, there are 127 grassroots cooperatives. As a result, the prices of industrial products and daily necessities have decreased, and the prices of local specialty products have increased, and the income of the Mongolian people has generally increased. For example, in 1943, a castrated bull could only be exchanged for 150 feet of cloth, but now it can be exchanged for more than 500 feet of cloth. With the improvement of material life, the culture and education of the Mongolian people have also developed rapidly. There are 238 Mongolian primary schools in the entire Northeast region, with a total of 35,578 students, a large increase compared with the past, and the school enrollment rate of children has reached 30% to 80%. There are two middle schools, two junior normal schools, and 1,517 middle school students. There are also nine Mongolian students at Harbin Institute of Technology. All schools pay attention to the development of national languages. Middle schools teach Mongolian for five or six hours a week; primary schools have Mongolian classes. Health care in the Mongolian areas has been greatly improved, and health centers or health clinics have been generally established in each banner. Ongniud Banner, which has syphilis infections, has established a syphilis treatment team and an epidemic prevention station, and has trained epidemic prevention and health personnel in the rural areas of each banner. As a result, the population has increased. According to a typical survey of three villages in 1952, the population increased by 25% compared with 1943.

There are approximately 130,000 Mongolian people in the Northwest region, approximately 60,000 in Xinjiang Province, approximately 30,000 in Ningxia Province, 25,000 in Qinghai Province, approximately 5,000 in Gansu Province, and the rest are scattered in other provinces and cities. Although the Mongolian areas in the Northwest region were liberated later, the Mongolian political, economic, and cultural aspects have also developed considerably. Alxa Banner and Ejin Banner in Ningxia Province have been established as autonomous regions equivalent to counties. Gansu has established the Subei Mongolian Autonomous Region equivalent to a district. The Mongolian people in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other regions have also participated in the work of the government. There are Mongolian representatives serving as members of the Northwest Administrative Committee, and there are also Mongolian representatives serving as members of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Committee. National autonomous regions and national democratic coalition governments will be generally established in the Mongolian areas this year. The Mongolian people in the Northwest region mainly engage in animal husbandry. Alxa Banner in Ningxia Province had approximately 50,000 horses and 150,000 camels more than ten years ago. Due to the plunder of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang gangs, only more than 3,000 horses and more than 50,000 camels were left in the entire banner at the time of liberation. Now the number of various livestock in the entire banner has increased by two to three times compared with the time of liberation in 1949. The number of livestock in the Mongolian people in Gansu Province has doubled. The number of livestock in the Mongolian people in Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other provinces is also gradually increasing. Some areas in Mongolia have now established veterinary hospitals, epidemic prevention stations, breeding stations, artificial insemination stations, and breeding groups, as well as livestock protection committees and grassland management stations and other organizations for increasing and protecting livestock. The culture and education of the Mongolian people in the Northwest region have also developed significantly. For example, the number of Mongolian primary school students in Alxa Banner, Ningxia Province has increased by one and a half times compared with before liberation, and the number of primary school students in Ejin Banner has increased by more than three times compared with before liberation. The Subei Mongolian Autonomous Region in Gansu Province had no schools in history, and no one was literate. However, since the establishment of the autonomous region people's government, three schools have been established, with more than 100 students. Because the People's Government attaches importance to national languages, Mongolian languages ​​have developed greatly in various Mongolian areas. Xinjiang has published a large number of Mongolian books and pictorials. From 1951 to 1952 alone, 24 kinds of Mongolian books were published, totaling 31,352 copies; in 1952, 4,000 copies of the single-volume edition of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong were also published in Mongolian. The Northwest Pictorial Publishing House has also published a Mongolian version. Medical and health undertakings are also developing: health institutions have been established with emphasis in various Mongolian areas, and health workers have been trained. Health groups have also been established and health workers have been trained in the Mongolian pastoral areas of Qinghai, where health is relatively backward. The population in the Mongolian areas is now increasing, and the infant mortality rate is gradually decreasing; many women who longed for children in the past are now holding babies.

In addition, according to existing statistics, there are approximately 8,000 Mongolian people in the Southwest region, mainly distributed in Tibet and Yunnan; there are more than 30,000 in the Central South region, mainly distributed in Henan, Hubei, and other provinces; there are approximately 5,000 in the East China region, mainly distributed in Jiangsu Province. The Mongolian people in these regions all enjoy the same equal rights, and their economic and cultural lives are improving day by day.

[Note 1] Lindan Khan was the leader of the Chahar tribe group in Inner Mongolia at the end of the Ming Dynasty. In the early Qing Dynasty, when the Manchu Qing rulers invaded Inner Mongolia, Lindan Khan led 100,000 troops to resist the invasion of Emperor Taizong of the Qing Dynasty in 1634. Later, due to being outnumbered, he was defeated and fled to Qinghai, where he died of illness.

[Note 2] Galdan was the leader of the Mongolian tribes in the Ili region of Xinjiang. When Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty invaded Inner and Outer Mongolia, he resolutely resisted and began the anti-Manchu war in 1690 (the 29th year of Kangxi), fighting for six or seven years. Later, due to being outnumbered, he was defeated and fled to Outer Mongolia, where he committed suicide by poisoning himself.

[Note 3] Gada was from the Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner of Eastern Mongolia, and Meilin was his official title. During the period of the Northern Warlords, Zhang Zuolin colluded with Darhan Wang of Mongolia to invade the Mongolian region. From 1928, he established a survey bureau to plunder the land, cattle, and horses of the Mongolian people and forcibly reclaim wasteland. At that time, in order to protect the interests of the Mongolian nationality, Gada Meilin launched an uprising in Darhan Banner (now Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner), putting forward slogans such as "No plundering of people's property" and "Down with the survey bureau." Initially, there were only a dozen people, but later it expanded to more than 1,000 people, defending the land on both sides of the Xin'kai River. Later, he was eventually defeated by the joint attack of Zhang Zuolin and Darhan Wang, and was defeated in the Niemulaji Mountain area, but he resolutely refused to surrender and committed suicide by jumping into the river.

[Note 4] Li Yuzhi was a communist party member of the Mongolian nationality. During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Chinese Communist Party carried out work in the Rehe-Suiyuan-Chahar area, and he led Mongolian youth to establish a Mongolian national armed force. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit betrayed the revolution, Bai Yunti, a Mongolian national scum who once carried the banner of revolution, followed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's betrayal, disarmed the Mongolian armed forces, and Comrade Li Yuzhi was also brutally killed.

    蒙族人民在前进
    茂敖海
    编者按：今年五月一日是内蒙古自治区成立六周年纪念日。内蒙古自治区的各项工作在过去六年中已获得光辉的成就，成为少数民族区域自治的良好榜样。下面这篇文章较详细地介绍了蒙古民族和各地区的蒙族人民解放后的幸福生活。
    蒙族是我们伟大祖国的优秀民族之一，在我国少数民族中是人口较多的一个民族，现在共有一百七十多万人。蒙族起初散居在贝加尔湖以南、大戈壁以北的广大地区，过着游牧生活。十三世纪初叶成吉思汗统一蒙古各部以来，蒙族就以一个伟大强悍的民族著称于世。蒙族分布地区很广，华北及内蒙古自治区是蒙族的主要聚居区；东北区的热河、辽西、黑龙江、吉林等省和西北区的新疆、青海、宁夏、甘肃等省也有很多蒙族人民聚居和杂居；西南、中南、华东等地区也有少数散居的蒙族人民。
    内蒙、华北、西北的蒙古族居住地区幅员辽阔，有茂密的大森林，有广大的草原和肥沃的土地，出产大批的木材、皮毛、粮食，地下蕴藏有金、铁、煤、盐、碱、云母、石棉等矿产。
    蒙族有自己共同的语言、文字——蒙古语和蒙古文。蒙古语有独特的语法结构和基本辞汇，属于阿尔泰语系蒙古语族。古时候的蒙古语很像四六句的诗，娓婉动听。近年来在牧业区仍然保持着这种语言。蒙古文创造于元朝忽必烈时代，主要由拼音字母和个别单音字母组成，容易学也容易记。蒙古人会蒙古文的相当普遍。蒙古文在内蒙古自治区以及东北、华北、宁夏、甘肃、青海等蒙族分布地区均通行。新疆新旧土尔扈特蒙古族所用的蒙文，字母和语音略有不同，仅通行于新疆蒙族居住地区。蒙古族在很早以前就曾用蒙文推行政令，记载史事，翻译经典，写作文艺。
    满清时代喇嘛教在蒙古地区极盛行，现在居住在西北各地区的蒙族人民和内蒙古自治区的一部分蒙族人民仍信仰喇嘛教。
    蒙族人民勇敢善骑，他们骑上马一天能走几百里，六、七岁的小孩也能骑马。蒙古人民喜爱歌唱且善于歌唱，一般男女都能自编自唱。在草地庙会，在那达慕大会，在农闲期或过年节时，蒙民时常聚在一起唱歌、说书和朗诵诗歌。他们演唱的内容大部是一代一代传下来的历史传说和英雄人物的事迹。
    蒙族人民多从事农牧业。种五谷、养牲畜是他们的主要生产。以地区分别来讲：内蒙古自治区的农业人口比重大，牧业人口比重小；但是牧业区的面积大，约占内蒙古自治区总面积的四分之三。东北区的蒙族人民主要从事农业，经营牧业的很少。华北区和西北区的蒙族人民主要从事牧业，经营农业的很少。其他地区的蒙族人民主要从事农业。蒙族的农业经济情况多数与东北区的汉族相近，多住于平地，耕种旱田，且生产工具较齐全。牧业区的社会经济情况则与汉族完全不同。牧业区的蒙族人民多选择草地和山坡架蒙古包居住，专养牲畜，随一年四季的气候逐水草放牧。但现已有一部分蒙族牧民开始定居。
    蒙古民族在历史上曾有过不少的反侵略、反压迫的伟大的斗争史实，出现过不少英雄人物。在满清统治时期，蒙族人民曾进行过多次的反对民族压迫的英勇斗争，其中著名的有林丹汉〔注一〕、葛尔丹〔注二〕的斗争。葛尔丹领导的反满战争从一六九○年起坚持了七年。北洋军阀统治时期，在东蒙爆发了嘎达梅林〔注三〕的反军阀斗争。这个斗争不仅打击了军阀们掠夺蒙族人民财富的野心，也粉碎了蒙族内部反动王公出卖民族利益的阴谋。嘎达梅林在战场上、在敌人的监狱里始终坚持斗争，保持了民族气节。一九二四年北京的蒙藏学校有大批的蒙古青年参加了中国共产党的组织，现在的内蒙古自治区人民政府主席乌兰夫就是当时在该校参加了党的组织的一个蒙古优秀青年。这些先进的蒙古青年把马克思列宁主义和中国革命的道理在蒙古地区广泛地传播着，散播了革命的种子。第一次国内革命战争时期，蒙族人民在中国共产党领导下开辟热绥察地区的革命工作，并建立了一支革命的民族武装。当时壮烈牺牲的蒙族革命武装的领导者之一共产党员李裕智〔注四〕烈士，就是蒙族人民的优秀儿子。第二次国内革命战争时期，蒙族人民革命斗争转入地下，在极端困难的情况下坚持着。一九三七年抗日战争爆发，蒙族人民和八路军一起进行了抗日游击战争，建立了大青山抗日政权和抗日游击队。在解放战争时期，蒙族人民在共产党领导下成立了以乌兰夫为首的内蒙古自治运动联合会，进行了民族区域自治运动，并建立了蒙族人民革命武装，配合人民解放军把国民党反动派由内蒙地区赶了出去。这些史实证明了蒙古民族是有着英勇斗争的光荣革命传统的一个民族。蒙族人民虽然在历代反动统治的残酷压迫下，受尽了歧视、侮辱、剥削和屠杀，但是他们始终没有终止斗争，最后在中国共产党领导下，终于得到了最后的胜利。
    解放后，在毛主席伟大的民族政策的光辉照耀下，蒙族人民在政治上、经济上、文化上都得到了翻身。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和中央人民政府委员会都有蒙族代表任委员。根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领民族区域自治政策，在蒙族聚居区成立自治区人民政府，其中成立较早、发展较快的是内蒙古自治区。
    内蒙古自治区成立于一九四七年五月一日，是相当于大行政区一级的自治区人民政府。在这六年当中，自治区的政治、经济、文化各方面都有很大的发展。全区普遍召开了各级人民代表会议，有五个旗代行了人民代表大会职权，全区百分之九十以上的嘎查（村）实行了民主选举。农业区在一九四八年就完成了土地改革，紧接着开展了大规模的生产运动。现在全区农村劳动力百分之七十以上已组织起来，并且试办了十五个农业生产合作社。农业生产量一年比一年增加，一九五二年自治区粮食总产量比解放前的最高年产量超过百分之二十五。在牧业区也废除了封建的特权，进行了必要的民主改革，贯彻了“不斗不分不划阶级”“自由放牧、保畜增畜”的政策，蒙族人民的牲畜也一年比一年增殖起来了。现在的牲畜数目已较一九四七年增加了一倍。森林采伐工业是内蒙古自治区的最大企业。由于合理采伐，已超额完成了采伐计划。与大量采伐同时，也重视了育苗造林工作。最近三年中完成了七千八百五十八垧的造林计划。由于贸易合作事业的发展，过去城乡对立与农牧矛盾的旧关系已变为城乡互助与农牧团结的新关系。现在国营贸易机构有一百七十一处，合作社基层社有六百九十多个。内蒙古过去没有工业，自治区人民政府成立后已开始发展工业，现在各种大小工厂已有五十多处，且正设计建立更大更多的工厂。由于各项生产事业的发展，蒙族人民的生活大大地改善了，一九五一年每人平均购买力比一九四七年增加了百分之三十七点四二，一九五二年更增加了。随着自治区财政情况的好转和人民生活的普遍提高，文化教育事业也有了很大发展。一九四七年全区小学校仅有八百四十三所，到一九五一年底已经发展到三千七百七十四所了，一九五二年又比一九五○年增加了百分之十二强。入学儿童现在已占学龄儿童的百分之六十四，过去教育比较落后的牧业区的小学和学生也都增加了一倍。中学有十二所，中学生比过去增加了六倍。此外还有师范、林业、商业、卫生、畜牧兽医等专门性的学校。正在设计中的内蒙古高等学校不久也将建立起来。自治区的蒙族小学都用本民族的语文进行教学，中学也有部分课程用蒙文教学。蒙文书刊由一九四九年到一九五二年共出版了三百三十种，计一百九十四万二千余册，蒙文的“毛泽东选集”第一卷的单行本也全部出版了。其他文化艺术事业也有了很大发展。现自治区内有五个文工团、队，文艺工作干部中蒙族占百分之五十八强。较大的城镇都建立了电影院和文化馆，并有十一个电影放映队经常到农村、草地巡回演出。六年来出现了不少优秀的具有民族形式的文艺作品，其中有很多是工、农、兵、牧民出身的蒙民的作品。玛拉沁夫的小说“科尔沁草原的人们”、美丽其格的诗“举杯祝福毛主席”都受到了全国广大人民的欢迎。蒙文的文艺作品包括小说、通讯、快板、诗、歌曲、剧本等也大批出现了，其中著名的三十一种作品，分别得到人民政府的奖励。自治区卫生事业也在不断发展，蒙族婴儿死亡率大为减少，牧业区蒙族人口已停止下降，转为上升。现在各旗县已普遍设立了卫生院，有一百七十八个努图克（区）建立了卫生所。牧业区蒙族人民多年来最感痛苦的性病已停止蔓延。
    华北、东北、西北的蒙族居住地区在解放后，各方面也都有显著的发展。
    华北区的蒙族约十七万人，其中约有十六万人聚居在绥远省。其他散居在山西、河北两省及北京市。一九四九年绥远解放后，相继在伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟成立两个专区级的自治区；在绥东四旗成立了中心旗人民政府。在人民政府领导和帮助下，农业区实行了土地改革，蒙族人民分得了土地和生产资料。在牧业区废除了封建特权，实行了“不斗不分保畜增畜”的政策，并在各旗、区有重点地建立了兽医防治站和兽医诊疗所。因此牲畜逐年增加：如伊克昭盟的牲畜一九五二年较一九五一年增殖了将近三分之一，乌兰察布盟有些地区的牲畜一九五二年较一九五○年增加了一倍到三倍。现在牧业区已开始有重点地用苏联卡巴金马配种，并准备重点播种牧草，使牧民由游牧逐渐走向定居，进一步发展牧业生产。由于农牧业的发展，蒙族人民的购买力一九五二年较解放前提高了百分之一百六十四。伊克昭盟解放前在草地里没有一所学校，现在平均每个旗、区都至少有一所小学。解放后全盟共增加了小学三百多所，还成立了一所中学。每个蒙古包里都有了识字课本，男女牧民一边放牧，一边学习识字，已成为习惯。喇嘛庙里也组织起读报组和识字班。在蒙族小学都用本民族语文上课，蒙古中学里也有蒙文课。卫生事业也有了显著的发展。以乌兰察布盟为例，过去全盟没有一个卫生医疗机构，现在盟、旗已设立了六处卫生院，在区设立了七处卫生所，此外还有两处卫生保健站，并训练了接生员一百零七人。因此过去逐年人口下降的趋势已停止，部分地区人口且开始上升。绥远在历史上是蒙汉民族之间纠纷最多且较严重的一个地区，但是解放后由于执行了毛主席的民族政策，蒙汉之间的隔阂和仇视根本消除了，并建立了平等、互助、友爱、团结的新的民族关系。现在已经出现了无数亲密团结的蒙汉两族人民共同组织的互助组。
    东北区的蒙族约有四十五万人，分布在热河省的约二十七万，在辽西省的约十一万。其余聚居或杂居在黑龙江、吉林等省的蒙旗内和散居在沈阳市和松江省。东北蒙族地区已建立和巩固了人民民主政权。自一九四九年起，蒙旗各级人民代表会议已成为经常制度。在蒙族地区的干部和人民代表多数为蒙族人民，现在全区有二千二百四十四名蒙族干部。一九五三年将普遍建立民族区域自治和民族民主联合政府。东北地区的蒙族人民在土地改革时和汉族同样分得了土地、牲畜、房屋和生产工具。几年来在共产党和人民政府的领导下，蒙族的农业经济有了很大的恢复和发展。以黑龙江省杜尔伯特旗为例，全旗蒙族二、二五六户中已有一、八○四户过着中农生活，占总户数百分之八十。牧业区主要在热河省翁牛特旗，现在牧区的牲畜头数比一九四三年增加百分之二十五，特别是牧民生活主要来源的牛已超过伪满最高水平百分之五十。牧民已完全改变了过去终年穿着冬天毛朝里、夏天毛朝外的破烂皮袄的苦况。国营贸易公司及合作社在蒙旗内也已普遍的建立，只在热河省敖汉、翁牛特、喀喇沁、喀喇沁左等四个旗内就有一百二十七个基层合作社。因而工业产品及日用必需品价格降低，土特产品价格有了提高，蒙民的收入普遍增加了。如一九四三年一头犍牛只换一百五十尺布，现在可换五百多尺布。随着物质生活的提高，蒙族的文化教育也有飞跃的发展。东北全区蒙族小学有二三八处，学生共三五、五七八名，比过去大为增加，儿童就学率达到百分之三十到八十。有中学两处，初级师范两处，中学生有一、五一七名。在哈尔滨市工业大学还有九名蒙族学生。各学校都注意发展民族语文，中学每周讲授五、六小时的蒙文；小学都有蒙文课。蒙族地区的卫生事业已有了很大的改进，各旗普遍建立了卫生院或卫生所。有梅毒传染病的翁牛特旗建立了梅毒治疗队和防疫站，在各旗农村中训练了防疫卫生人员。因而人口增加了。一九五二年据三个屯的典型调查，人口比一九四三年增加了百分之二十五。
    西北区蒙族共约有十三万人，新疆省约六万人，宁夏省约三万人；青海省二万五千人，甘肃省约五千人，其他散居在其他省市。西北蒙族地区虽解放较晚，但蒙族的政治、经济、文化也有相当的发展。宁夏省阿拉善、额济纳两旗均成立了相当于县的自治区，甘肃已成立了相当于区的肃北蒙族自治区，新疆、青海等地区的蒙族人民也参加了政权工作。西北行政委员会有蒙族代表任委员，新疆省人民政府委员会也有蒙族代表任委员。今年蒙族地区将普遍建立民族自治区和民族民主联合政府。西北区蒙族主要从事于牧业。宁夏阿拉善旗在十余年前约有马五万匹，骆驼十五万只。由于蒋马匪帮的掠夺，到临解放时全旗仅剩下三千多匹马和五万多只骆驼。现在全旗各种牲畜已比一九四九年刚解放时增加了二倍到三倍。甘肃省蒙族牲畜增加了一倍。青海、新疆等省蒙族牲畜也在逐渐增加。现在蒙族有些地区已建立了兽医院、防治站、种畜站、人工受精站和配种小组以及保畜委员会和草原管理站等增畜保畜的组织。西北蒙族的文化教育也有显著的发展，例如：宁夏阿拉善旗蒙族小学生比解放前增加了一倍半，额济纳旗小学生比解放前增加了三倍多。甘肃肃北蒙族自治区在历史上没有过学校，大家都不识字。但是自成立自治区人民政府以来，已成立了三个学校，有一百多学生。由于人民政府重视民族语文，各蒙族地区蒙古语文有很大发展。新疆出版了大量的蒙文书籍和画报，只一九五一年到一九五二年就出版了蒙文书籍二十四种，共三万一千三百五十二册；一九五二年又出版了毛泽东选集蒙文单行本共四千册。西北画报社也出版了蒙文版。医疗卫生事业也在发展：各蒙族地区有重点地建立了卫生机构，并培养训练了卫生工作人员。在卫生较落后的青海蒙族牧区也建立了卫生小组和训练了卫生员。现在蒙族地区的人口已在增加，婴儿死亡率逐渐降低；过去许多渴望子女的妇女现在已抱上娃娃了。
    另外，据现有材料统计，蒙族在西南区约有八千人，主要分布于西藏、云南；在中南区约有三万多人，主要分布于河南、湖北等省；在华东区约有五千人，主要分布于江苏省。这些地区的蒙族人民都同样享受着一切平等权利，经济和文化生活都在日益提高。
    〔注一〕林丹汉在明末时为内蒙古察尔部集团的首领。清初，满清统治者侵略内蒙古，林丹汉在一六三四年率部十万曾抵抗清太宗的侵略。后因寡不敌众，败走到青海病死。
    〔注二〕葛尔丹是新疆伊犁地区蒙古诸部的首领，清康熙侵略内外蒙古时，曾坚决抵抗，并在一六九○年（康熙二十九年）开始进行反满战争，转战六、七年，后终因寡不敌众，败走外蒙古，后服毒自杀。
    〔注三〕嘎达是东蒙科尔沁左翼中旗人，梅林是他的官称。北洋军阀时期，张作霖勾结蒙古的达尔罕王侵入蒙古地区，从一九二八年开始成立测量局，掠夺蒙族人民的土地、牛马，强行开荒。当时嘎达梅林为了保护蒙古民族利益，在达尔罕旗（现科尔沁左翼中旗）起义，提出“不许抢掠民财”“打倒测量局”等口号。最初仅十数人，后扩大到一千多人，保卫了新开河两岸的土地。后终不敌张作霖和达尔罕王的合力进攻，败于聂木拉吉山地区，但坚不投降而投河自杀。
    〔注四〕李裕智是蒙古民族的共产党员。在第一次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党在热绥察地区开展工作，他领导蒙古青年建立了一支蒙古民族武装。蒋匪介石叛变革命后，一度打着革命幌子的蒙古民族败类白云梯追随蒋匪叛变，把蒙族武装缴械，李裕智同志也被残杀。
