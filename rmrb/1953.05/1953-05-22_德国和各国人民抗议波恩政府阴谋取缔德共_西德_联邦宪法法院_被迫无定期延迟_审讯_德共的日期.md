Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to a report from the German News Agency: German working people and many foreign people's organizations have been writing letters or sending telegrams to the West German Karlsruhe "Federal Constitutional Court" protesting the Bonn government's plot to declare the German Communist Party illegal. According to instructions from the Bonn "government," the court was preparing to begin a "trial" of the German Communist Party on June 8th in order to realize the plan to declare the German Communist Party illegal.

The German Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization pointed out in a letter that the German Communist Party has become an important and powerful force for the German people in their struggle to maintain peace and to strive for the unification of their motherland by peaceful means. The letter stated: "The trial attempting to ban the German Communist Party is a trial against the German working class and all peace-loving people. The German Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization, together with the entire German working class, protests the trial aimed at banning the German Communist Party and demands the immediate withdrawal of the deliberation on this issue."

Non-partisan workers, Social Democratic workers, and Communist workers in Olrich, West Germany, unanimously passed a telegram to the Karlsruhe Constitutional Court at a rally commemorating the 135th anniversary of Marx's birth, demanding the withdrawal of the proposal to examine the declaration of the German Communist Party as illegal on June 8th.

The Potsdam branch of the Free German Trade Union Federation of the German Democratic Republic and 3,600 workers at the Merseburg Upper Robling brown coal factory in Halle also demanded the withdrawal of preparations for the "trial" of the German Communist Party.

The Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, in a telegram protesting the Adenauer government's attempt to "try" the German Communist Party, pointed out that declaring the German Communist Party illegal is a step in preparing for a war of aggression, and therefore it is equally dangerous to the British people. The protest telegram demanded that all trade union organizations in Britain protest the declaration of the German Communist Party as illegal and rise up against the establishment of a new Nazi army.

The Labor Progressive Party of Canada and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers also sent protest telegrams.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch from Karlsruhe (West Germany): Under the strong pressure of German and international people protesting the persecution of the German Communist Party, the First Chamber of the West German "Federal Constitutional Court" was forced on the 19th to announce an indefinite postponement of the date for the "trial" of the German Communist Party. The "Federal Constitutional Court" had originally scheduled to begin the "trial" of the German Communist Party on June 8th in order to declare the German Communist Party illegal.

    德国和各国人民抗议波恩政府阴谋取缔德共
    西德“联邦宪法法院”被迫无定期延迟“审讯”德共的日期
    【新华社二十日讯】据德意志通讯社消息：德国劳动人民和许多外国人民团体纷纷写信或打电报给西德加尔斯卢合“联邦宪法法院”，抗议波恩政府打算宣布德国共产党为非法的阴谋。根据波恩“政府”的指示，法院准备在六月八日对德国共产党开始“审讯”，以实现宣布德国共产党为非法的计划。
    德国工人反对重新军国主义化委员会在信中指出，德国共产党已经成为德国人民为维护和平与为用和平方式争取祖国统一而斗争的重要和强大的力量。信中说：“企图禁止德国共产党的审讯是对德国工人阶级和所有爱好和平的人民进行的审讯。德国工人反对重新军国主义化委员会与整个德国工人阶级共同抗议目的在于禁止德国共产党的审讯，并要求立即撤销审议这个问题。”
    西德奥立希地方的无党派工人、社会民主党工人与共产党工人在纪念马克思诞生一百三十五周年的集会上一致通过致加尔斯卢合宪法法院的电报，要求撤销在六月八日审查宣布德国共产党为非法的提案。
    德意志民主共和国自由德国工会联合会波茨坦分会和哈雷的墨兹堡上罗布林根褐煤工厂的三千六百个工人也要求撤销“审讯”德国共产党的准备。
    英国共产党政治委员会在抗议阿登纳政府企图“审讯”德国共产党的电报中指出，宣布德共为非法是准备侵略战争的一个步骤，因此它对于英国人也是同样地危险。抗议电要求英国所有的工会组织抗议宣布德共为非法，并起来反抗建立一支新纳粹军队。
    加拿大劳工进步党和国际民主法律工作者协会也发出了抗议电。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据德意志通讯社加尔斯卢合（西德）讯：西德“联邦宪法法院”第一院在德国国内外人民抗议迫害德国共产党的强大压力之下，已于十九日被迫宣布无定期延迟“审讯”德国共产党的日期。“联邦宪法法院”原定六月八日开始“审讯”德国共产党，以便宣布德国共产党为非法。
