    Do a Good Job in Locust Control with Medicines and Machinery
    Plant Protection Department, Central Ministry of Agriculture
    The Central Ministry of Agriculture has summarized its three years of experience in locust control: using medicines and machinery to eliminate locusts can save more than a hundred times the labor compared to manual catching and beating, and it can also eliminate locusts more quickly before they reach the third instar. This year's policy for preventing and controlling migratory locusts is to "rely mainly on agents," mobilizing the people to use medicines and machinery for control. Because large-scale use of medicines and machinery to control locusts is still a relatively new task, and 666 powder, a toxic insecticide, if used improperly, will not only fail to exert the effectiveness of the medicines and machinery but will also cause pesticide damage and waste. In order to do a good job in this year's locust control with medicines and machinery, the following suggestions are put forward:
      (1) Only by doing a good job in reconnaissance (checking for eggs, nymphs, and adults) can we accurately grasp the locust situation and proactively overcome locust plagues. This year, all locust-affected areas have prepared a large number of locust control medicines and machinery. If reconnaissance is relaxed, medicines and machinery will be used blindly, causing unnecessary waste and losses. Reconnaissance of the locust situation is a long-term and continuous task, but some areas have not paid enough attention to this work. For example, in the allocation of reconnaissance personnel, sufficient manpower has not been invested, and in some areas, the complex reconnaissance work has been assigned to untrained personnel. This makes it difficult to do a good job in reconnaissance.
    (2) 666 powder is the most effective locust control agent, but it does not yet have the conditions for widespread use. Therefore, it must be concentrated and used in areas with vast land and sparse population, labor difficulties, and severe locust situations. In order to ensure that the masses truly master the usage techniques, all migrant workers using medicines and machinery must undergo a short period of technical training, and the dusting or bait spreading teams must be strictly and separately organized to handle the medicines and machinery. For example, in the Shandong locust area in 1952, a large number of activists were carefully trained in advance, and the organization for using medicines and machinery was improved, resulting in the full utilization of the effectiveness of the medicines and machinery. However, some areas distributed the medicines and machinery evenly to counties, districts, and townships, instead of concentrating them in a planned way for unified allocation and organized use, causing locust-affected areas to feel that there were insufficient medicines and machinery, while other areas had large amounts stockpiled, resulting in losses. Therefore, this year, in the organizational leadership for locust control with medicines and machinery, we must promptly overcome the ideas of egalitarianism and localism.
      (3) Because using poisoned bait to control locusts is the most economical and effective method, poisoned bait can be spread in barren land with short and sparse weeds, seedling fields, or tall crops with considerable row spacing where sunlight can penetrate and locust nymphs can move freely. However, many locust-affected areas are disaster areas, and some areas have inconvenient transportation, making it difficult to temporarily purchase wheat bran. Therefore, wheat bran must be ordered in advance through cooperatives, and the transportation and storage problems must be solved in a planned way, and wheat bran substitutes (such as pumpkin shreds, etc.) should be used as much as possible. When locust nymphs occur in overgrown grass and reed fields, and sunlight cannot reach the ground, nymph groups are not easy to move, or there are small areas of standing water, or locust nymphs are on plants, it is appropriate to spray 666 powder. In addition, in areas where the density of locust nymphs is relatively low and labor is not too scarce, manual compression can be used to a considerable extent before dusting to kill them, which can save labor and powder. However, before carrying out this work, it is necessary to calculate how to achieve the rational use of medicines and machinery.
      (4) Last year, in some areas of Shandong, Anhui, Hebei, and other provinces, political and ideological education was carried out on dusting migrant workers, which not only created a new record of spraying only one and a half jin of powder per mu with an effect of more than 90%, but also had special personnel responsible for the storage, transportation, and maintenance of medicines and machinery, so as to give full play to the effectiveness of the medicines and machinery. However, in some areas, national property was not cherished, medicines and machinery were not taken care of by special personnel, and were not maintained after use, resulting in major losses such as the whereabouts of dusters being unknown, or being unusable, and 666 powder becoming ineffective due to dampness. This year, the number of medicines and machinery used for preventing and controlling migratory locusts has greatly increased compared with previous years, and technical guidance is particularly important. To this end, all localities should strengthen the patriotic, production increase, and thrift education for cadres and migrant workers, so that they can consciously cherish and save medicines and machinery, so as to prevent losses and waste of national property.

    做好药械治蝗工作
    中央农业部植物保护司
    中央农业部总结三年来防治蝗虫的经验：使用药械除治蝗虫比人工捕打可以节省劳力百倍以上，而且又能把蝗虫更迅速地消灭在三龄以前。今年防治飞蝗的方针是以“药剂为主”，发动人工使用药械进行除治。因为大规模的使用药械防治蝗虫还是一个比较新的工作，治蝗的六六六粉，又是一种含有毒性的杀虫药剂，如果使用不当，不但不能发挥药械效能，而且会发生药害和形成浪费现象。为了做好今年药械治蝗工作，特提出以下几点意见：
      （一）做好侦查工作（查卵、查蝻、查成虫），才能正确的掌握蝗情，主动地战胜蝗灾。今年各地蝗区已准备了大量的治蝗药械，如果放松了侦查工作，就会发生盲目地使用药械，造成了不应有的浪费和损失。侦查蝗情又是长期性连续性的工作，目前有些地区对于这一工作没有重视起来。如在侦查人员的配备上，还没有投入足够的力量，有的地区，把复杂的侦查工作推给没有训练过的人员去担任。这样就很难把侦查工作做好。
    （二）六六六粉是最有效的治蝗药剂，但目前尚未具备普遍使用的条件，因此必须集中起来使用于地广人稀，劳力困难和蝗情严重的地区。为了使群众确实掌握使用技术，凡使用药械的民工必须经过短时期的技术训练，把喷粉队或撒饵队严密地分别地组织起来担任药械手工作。如一九五二年山东蝗区，因事前认真地训练了大批积极分子，健全了使用药械组织，结果就充分地发挥了药械效能；但有些地区，把药械平均分散到县、区、乡，而不是有计划的集中起来统一调配，有组织地使用，致使蝗情严重的地区感觉到药械不足，而有些地区反大量积压，造成损失。因此今年各地在使用药械治蝗组织领导方面，必须及时克服平均主义及本位主义的思想。
      （三）由于使用毒饵治蝗是最经济而有效的办法，凡在杂草短小、稀疏的荒地、作物幼苗地或有相当株行距的高大作物，阳光能够射入，蝗蝻可以自由活动的环境下，均可撒布毒饵。但很多蝗区是灾区，有的地区交通不便，临时收购麦麸必有困难，因此必须事先通过合作社订购麦麸，有计划的解决运输及贮藏问题，并尽量使用麦麸的代用品（如南瓜丝等）。凡蝗蝻发生在盛草及芦苇地，及阳光不能射到地面，蝻群不易活动，或有小面积的积水地、蝗蝻在植物上时，均以喷撒六六六粉为适宜。此外在蝗蝻密度较稀、劳力不太缺乏的地区，可先用人工压缩至相当程度后再喷粉毒杀，这样就能节省人工和药粉。但在进行这一工作之前，必须先计算一下，怎样使药械达到合理使用。
      （四）去年山东、安徽、河北等省部分地区，由于对喷粉民工进行了政治思想教育，不仅创造了每亩地喷粉一斤半，效果仍在百分之九十以上的新纪录，且在药械的储运保管方面，都有专人负责，做到充分发挥药械的效能。但也有些地区，对国家财产不加爱护，药械无专人负责，用后不加保养，以致造成喷粉器不知下落，或不能使用以及六六六粉受潮失效等重大损失。今年防治飞蝗使用药械的数量比往年大大增多，技术指导工作就特别重要。为此，各地应加强对干部、民工的爱国主义增产节约教育，使其自觉地爱护和节约使用药械，以防止造成国家资财的损失和浪费。
