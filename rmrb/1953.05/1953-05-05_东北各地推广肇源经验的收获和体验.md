The Gains and Experiences of Promoting the Zhaoyuan Experience in Various Parts of Northeast China
Office of the Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

I.

Throughout Northeast China, whether in the northern or southern regions, the vast number of rural work cadres and peasant masses who have earnestly promoted the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience have received a profound education. The promotion of the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience has powerfully driven forward the spring plowing preparation work. It has shattered the conservative thinking of the peasant masses such as "production has reached its limit" and "relying on heaven for food," and has strengthened the confidence of peasants in striving for increased production. Many regions' peasants have conducted on-the-spot observations according to the Zhaoyuan method, made detailed calculations, and especially compared local good and bad examples, truly recognizing the enormous potential of agriculture. Therefore, they can all proactively and actively tap production increase potential and revise production increase plans. The key experimental villages in Beizhen County, Liaoxi Province, have all revised their production increase plans, demanding an increase of 30 to 50 percent compared to the yield in 1952. After promoting the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience, the masses in Xinjian Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, found a basis for increasing production and raised the original plan for the entire village to produce 9,960 *shi* of grain for the whole year to 11,085 *shi*. The promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience has also powerfully promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The broad masses of peasants accepted the Zhaoyuan experience and immediately felt the shortage of labor. Therefore, individual households requested to be organized, low-level groups requested to be upgraded, and disbanded groups were reorganized. According to statistics from 23 counties including Suihua in Heilongjiang Province, in the work of Party rectification and implementing the Zhaoyuan experience, the following mutual aid groups were established and improved: 26,347 permanent groups, 39,557 seasonal groups, and 16,391 temporary groups. At the same time, due to the shortage of labor, mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production has also become a requirement of the broad masses. Everywhere generally reflects: "This time we must mobilize the women's labor force!" Women actively participate in groups, cooperatives, and learn new technologies. According to statistics from nine counties in Songjiang Province, 21,521 women participated in training classes. The promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience directly promoted the material preparation work for spring plowing. All regions are actively exploring fertilizer sources and delivering manure early. In Rehe Province, the fertilized area last year was 83 percent, and this year it is planned to reach 90 percent. In order to adapt to the needs of rational close planting and equal-spaced wide sowing, all regions are actively and systematically carrying out the work of reforming old agricultural tools. The most important thing about the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience is that it has reversed the generalized working style of rural work cadres and strengthened the ties between cadres and the masses. Many regions' cadres have examined and criticized the generalized working style of "more empty slogans and fewer specific methods" in past work. Many cadres reflect: In the past, mentioning increased production meant more plowing, but now we have new methods! They have become more interested in rural work and agricultural technology than before. The masses reflect: In the past, cadres went to the countryside and only ran to village governments, cooperatives, and elementary schools, but this time it has changed! Some peasants provide transportation for cadres, and some said to cadres: "Why didn't you tell us these good methods earlier? See how much grain we have lost in the past!"

II.

In the process of promoting the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience, rural work cadres in various regions have gradually clarified the following issues:

First, the cultivation methods in most areas of Northeast China are relatively extensive. Missing seedlings and broken rows, uneven density, narrow seedling holes, and insufficient fertilizer are common phenomena. The Zhaoyuan experience can overcome these shortcomings. As long as this experience is combined with the specific conditions of the local area, it can be promoted not only in the vast areas of North Manchuria, but also in various parts of South Manchuria. Liaoxi and Rehe provinces combined the promotion of the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience with drought resistance, moisture preservation, and prevention and control of pests and diseases, which was welcomed by the broad masses of peasants and powerfully promoted the current work.

Second, the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience must be combined with the discovery and summarization of local typical bumper harvest experiences. Those who go deep into the fields with the peasant masses to investigate the arch mouth, count the seedlings, weigh the ears, calculate detailed accounts, compare local bumper harvest fields, general fields, and fields with particularly low harvests, and find out the reasons for more grain and less grain, can dispel the various ideological concerns of the peasants and increase their confidence in increasing production. Then, systematically introduce the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience, mobilize the masses to discuss in detail, specifically formulate production increase plans, and carry out production preparation work, which can mobilize the masses and make the promotion work a mass movement. Local experiences have also proved that carrying out agricultural technology reform among peasants, implementing typical demonstrations, and focusing on promotion are the most fundamental working methods. The old ways of lecturing from books, general appeals, laissez-faire, or full-scale implementation cannot effectively promote the Zhaoyuan experience.

Third, changing the leadership style and working style of rural work cadres, especially the county party committee's leadership in agricultural production, is the decisive factor in promoting the Zhaoyuan experience and implementing agricultural technology reform. Only by possessing the leadership style and working style of going deep into the agricultural production process, learning from the masses, studying agricultural production technology, concentrating the experience of the masses, and then promoting it, can the Zhaoyuan experience be smoothly promoted; and in the promotion, more advanced bumper harvest experiences from various regions can be concentrated, greatly improving the local agricultural production level. Generalized and formalistic leadership styles and working methods can only stifle the experience and creativity of the masses and make production stop at the original level. In some places, not only has the Zhaoyuan experience not been promoted, but it has also increased many concerns among the masses, which is the result of this working method. Experience has also proved that the process of promoting the Zhaoyuan experience is also a process of further improving the leadership style and working methods. The two promote each other. The idea and practice of trying to "thoroughly" change the style before promoting the Zhaoyuan experience is not realistic.

Fourth, the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience must be combined with the mutual aid and cooperation movement and patriotic political education. In places with a good foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, technical reform is easy to promote; and reforming technology increases the content of mutual aid and cooperation, further promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience, peasants in various regions have requested to expand and improve mutual aid groups, and peasants who have not joined the groups are actively requesting to join, which shows this point. Therefore, the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience must also rectify mutual aid and cooperation organizations and solve the difficulties of peasants lacking labor and livestock. At the same time, it is also necessary to continuously carry out patriotic education to closely integrate technical reform with the patriotic production increase movement. Achieve both increasing the wealth of peasants and improving the consciousness of peasants.

The biggest problem in promoting the Zhaoyuan experience at present is how to deepen it, consolidate the results of the movement, and make it truly play its due role in this year's spring plowing. Now the development of this movement is extremely uneven in various regions. Some have been fully launched, some are still in the propaganda stage, and a few places have not moved at all. Different types of regions have their own problems to be solved: In the first two types of regions, especially the first type, the masses generally feel that there is a shortage of labor and fertilizer, and the transformation of agricultural tools and technical guidance cannot keep up; if these problems are not solved, the results of the movement cannot be consolidated. In the latter type of region, the problem is how to do a good job in key experimental work before spring plowing, as a typical example for educating peasants in the subsequent production seasons, in order to gradually promote this movement. In response to this situation, Comrade Lin Feng recently instructed that a policy of "general appeal, key promotion" should be adopted to promote the Zhaoyuan experience step by step, and it should be combined with the requirements of bumper harvest areas in various regions, and efforts should be made to avoid the formalistic blind expansion and the phenomenon of emphasizing quantity over quality in the promotion work. We must achieve results in the key promotion areas as a basis for more extensive promotion in the future. All regions are working according to this instruction.

    东北各地推广肇源经验的收获和体验
    中共中央东北局农村工作部办公室
    一
    在全东北，不论北部地区还是南部地区，凡是认真推广了肇源丰产经验的广大农村工作干部、农民群众都受到极深刻的教育。肇源丰产经验的推广，有力地推动了春耕准备工作。它打破了农民群众“增产到顶”、“靠天吃饭”等保守思想，增强了农民争取增产的信心。许多地区的农民按照肇源的方法进行了实地观察，算了细账，特别是拿当地好坏典型作了对比，真正认识到了农业的极大潜在能力，因此，都能主动地、积极地挖掘增产潜力，修订增产计划。辽西省北镇县的重点试验村都修订了增产计划，要求比一九五二年的产量提高百分之三十到五十；黑龙江省克山县新建村在推广肇源丰产经验后，群众找到了增产根据，把原来要求全村全年产粮九千九百六十石的计划提高到一万一千零八十五石。推广肇源经验还有力地推动了互助合作运动。广大农民群众接受了肇源经验，立即感到劳力不足。因此，单干户要求组织起来，低级组要求提高，散伙的组又重新组织起来。据黑龙江省绥化等二十三县统计，在整党和推行肇源经验工作中，建立和健全的互助组有：常年组二万六千三百四十七个，季节组三万九千五百五十七个，临时组一万六千三百九十一个。同时，由于劳力不足，动员与组织妇女参加生产，也成为广大群众的要求。各地普遍反映：“这回可得把妇女劳力发动起来啦！”妇女们积极参加组、社和学习新技术。据松江省九个县统计，妇女参加训练班的就有二万一千五百二十一名。肇源经验的推广，直接推动了春耕的物质准备工作。各地都积极发掘粪源和提早送粪。热河省去年施肥面积为百分之八十三，今年计划达到百分之九十。各地为了适应合理密植、等距宽播的需要，正在积极地、有计划地进行改造旧农具的工作。肇源经验的推广，最重要的是扭转了农村工作干部一般化的工作作风，密切了干部和群众的联系。许多地区的干部检查和批判了过去工作上的“空喊多，具体办法少”的一般化作风，很多干部反映：过去一提增产就是多铲多趟，这回有了新的办法啦！他们对农村工作与农业技术都比以前发生了更大的兴趣。群众反映：过去干部下乡光是跑村政府、合作社、小学校，这回可变啦！有的农民套车接送干部，有的对干部说：“你们这些好办法，早咋不告诉咱呢？看过去少打了多少粮食！”
    二
    各地农村工作干部在推广肇源丰产经验的过程中逐渐明确了以下几个问题：
    第一、东北绝大部分地区的耕作方法都是比较粗放的。缺苗断条、稀厚不匀、苗眼窄、粪肥不足是普遍现象。肇源的经验，正可以克服这些缺点。这种经验只要结合了当地的具体情况，不仅在北满广大地区可以推广，在南满各地也是完全可以推广的。辽西、热河结合抗旱保墒、防治病虫害等工作推广肇源丰产经验，得到了广大农民的欢迎，并有力地推动了当前的工作。
    第二、推广肇源经验一定要与发掘和总结当地典型丰产经验相结合。凡是和农民群众一道深入田间，进行查弓口，数槎棵，称穗头，算细账，对比当地丰产田、一般田与收获特别少的田，找出多打粮与少打粮的原因的，就能解除农民的各种思想顾虑，提高其增产信心；再系统地介绍肇源丰产经验，发动群众详细讨论，具体地订出增产计划，进行生产准备工作，这就能发动群众，使推广工作成为群众性的运动。各地经验又证明：在农民中间进行农业技术改革，实行典型示范和重点推广是最根本的工作方法。老一套地照本讲课、一般号召、放任自流或全面铺开等等做法，都不能有效地推广肇源经验。
    第三、转变农村工作干部特别是县委领导农业生产的领导作风与工作作风，是推广肇源经验、推行农业技术改革的决定因素。只有具备了深入农业生产过程，向群众学习，钻研农业生产技术，集中群众的经验，再推广出去的领导作风与工作作风，才能使肇源经验顺利推广；并在推广中集中起各地更多的先进的丰产经验，大大提高当地的农业生产水平。一般化的、形式主义的领导作风与工作方法，只能窒息群众的经验与创造，使生产停止于原来的水平。有的地方，不但没能推广肇源经验，反而增加了群众很多的顾虑，正是这种工作方法的结果。经验又证明：推广肇源经验的过程又是领导作风与工作方法更进一步提高的过程。两者是互相推动的。那种企图先“彻底”转变作风然后再推广肇源经验的想法和作法是不切合实际的。
    第四、推广肇源经验必须与互助合作运动相结合，与爱国主义的政治教育相结合。互助合作基础好的地方，技术改革就容易推行；改革技术又增加了互助合作的内容，进一步推动互助合作运动的发展。推广肇源经验后，各地农民纷纷要求扩大与提高互助组，未入组的农民积极要求入组，就说明了这一点。因此，推广肇源经验必须同时整顿互助合作组织，解决农民缺乏劳力与畜力的困难。同时还必须不断地进行爱国主义的教育，使技术改革与爱国增产运动密切结合。做到既增加农民财富，又提高农民觉悟。
    目前推广肇源经验的最大问题是如何把它深入一步，巩固运动的成果，使它在今年的春耕中真正发挥应有的作用。现在这个运动在各地的发展极不平衡，有的已全面铺开，有的尚在宣传阶段，个别地方根本还没有动起来。各类地区各有其需要解决的问题：在前两类地区，特别是第一类地区，群众普遍感到劳力不足、粪肥不足，农具改造与技术指导跟不上；这些问题不解决，就无法巩固运动的成果。后一类地区，问题在如何在春耕前做好重点试验工作，作为以后各生产季节里教育农民的典型，以逐步推广这个运动。针对这种情况，最近林枫同志指示应采取“普遍号召，重点推广”有步骤地进行的方针来推广肇源经验，并与各地丰产地的要求结合起来，力避推广工作中形式主义的盲目铺开和重量不重质的现象，一定要在重点推广的地方做出成绩来，作为今后更广泛地推广的基础。各地正按这一指示进行工作。
