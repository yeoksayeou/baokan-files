Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 28th: The New York "Daily Worker" said on May 22nd that as the repatriated American sick and wounded prisoners of war returned home and talked about their experiences, the lies of "atrocities" fabricated by American newspapers with thick skins were constantly being exposed. The "Daily Worker" reprinted some facts published by Corporal Robert A. Hickox of Syracuse, New York, in the "Syracuse Herald-American" after he returned home on a thirty-day leave from the Valley Forge Hospital. Hickox, who was a prisoner of war in North Korea for twenty-nine months starting in November 1950, described the situation in the Korean-Chinese POW camps near the Yalu River, saying, "The Koreans gave us sports equipment and let us exercise ourselves. We swam many times. ... We were free to find something to do. The Koreans didn't prescribe any plans for us." Hickox said they also had alcohol, mostly vodka and Chinese whiskey, during holidays.

Hickox continued, "They let us celebrate every time it was our national holiday. At this time, we got extra food brought in from outside, Chinese whiskey, and sometimes Chinese cigarettes. We celebrated Christmas, New Year's Day, and Thanksgiving. Sometimes, on special days, they let us move freely in the POW camp, or even in a town." He said that last New Year's Eve, their "celebration was really lively." He said, "We put on our own plays and held concerts."

The "Daily Worker" published news of the repatriated Private First Class Jones Emmanuel Garriga returning home to Los Angeles, California, and his comments on the treatment he received in Korea. He told a reporter, "The people everywhere in Korea want peace. Every North Korean I met while I was a prisoner of war wanted peace. Our own soldiers are the same. Whenever there was news about a possible armistice, the mood of the American soldiers was very high."

The reporter asked Garriga what he thought of the so-called "atrocities." He replied, "I have nothing to say about that. Because I myself have neither suffered any atrocities, nor have I seen any atrocities, nor have I ever heard other American soldiers talk about such things."

When asked about the issue of "indoctrination," he replied, "I have not been indoctrinated. I was always invited by the North Koreans to participate in their celebrations and affairs. What I ate was always the same as what they ate, and they gave me their wine to drink and their cigarettes to smoke."

    美国病伤战俘回国后称道我方良好待遇
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】五月二十二日纽约“工人日报”说，由于被遣返回国的美国病伤战俘们纷纷回家并谈到了他们的经历，美国报纸厚着脸皮所胡诌的“暴行”的谎言就不断地被拆穿了。“工人日报”转载了纽约州西拉克斯镇罗伯特·亚·希考克斯下士回家后向“西拉克斯先驱美国人报”发表的一些事实，希考克斯是从福吉谷医院请了三十天的假回家的。希考克斯从一九五○年十一月起在北朝鲜做了二十九个月的战俘，他叙述了靠近鸭绿江的朝中战俘营的情况，他说：“朝鲜人给了我们运动设备，让我们自己作运动。我们游泳了好多次。……我们可以自由找点事情做。朝鲜人不替我们规定什么计划。”希考克斯说，他们还有酒喝，在逢节日的时候，多半都是喝的伏特卡和中国威士忌酒。
    希考克斯继续说：“每逢我们的全国性节日，他们让我们庆祝。这时我们得到从外面运进来的额外的食品、中国威士忌酒，有时还得到中国香烟。我们在圣诞节、新年、感恩节都举行庆祝。有时在特别的时日，他们让我们在战俘营中，偶或在一个镇中自由活动。”他说，去年除夕，他们的“庆祝真热闹”。他说：“我们演出了自己的戏，并且举行了音乐会。”
    “工人日报”登载了被遣返的战俘一等兵琼士·爱曼纽尔·加里加回到加利福尼亚州洛杉矶家中的消息，以及他对于他在朝鲜所受到的待遇的评论。他对一个记者说：“朝鲜各处人民都希望和平。在我当战俘的时候，我所遇到的北朝鲜人个个都希望和平。我们自己的士兵也是这样。每逢有关于可能停战的消息时，美国士兵们的情绪就很高。”
    记者问加里加对所谓“暴行”有什么意见。他答道：“对于这一点我没有什么话说。因为我自己既没有受到什么暴行，也没有看见任何暴行，也从未听见其他美国士兵说起过这样的事情。”
    问到“思想灌输”的问题时，他答道：“我没有受过思想灌输。我总是被北朝鲜人邀请参加他们的庆祝会和事务的。我吃的东西一直是和他们吃的一样，他们并把他们的酒给我喝，把他们的香烟给我吸”。
