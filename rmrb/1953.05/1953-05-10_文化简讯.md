    Han Chinese Cadres of the CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Bureau Learn Uyghur

    Han Chinese cadres of the CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Bureau are working hard to learn the Uyghur language and script. According to the resolution of the Second Party Congress of the CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Bureau in August 1952, Han Chinese cadres should learn the language and script of the local ethnic groups within two to three years. Han Chinese cadres of the Xinjiang Bureau began learning the Uyghur language last winter, with more than 100 people regularly participating. Currently, the study group led by Wang Enmao, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Xinjiang Bureau, and Rao Zhengxi, Standing Committee member, has each completed 33 lessons of the Uyghur literacy textbook. Among the general cadres, those with the best learning results have already gained a basic understanding of the Uyghur script and can hold ordinary conversations.

    Qinghai Film Projection Team Tours Pastoral Areas

    The Qinghai Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education Film Projection Team will further expand its projection work in pastoral areas this year. Currently, five projection teams are carrying a large number of films and slides to the Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Golog County for rotational screenings.

    This film projection team was established in October 1951. In 1952, the team cooperated with various visiting groups and work teams in Dulan, Qilian, Tongren, Henan Four Banners, Jianzha, Golog, and Yushu areas, screening a total of 441 shows, with an audience of over 750,000 people. Films such as "The Great Unity of All Nationalities of China," "Happy Xinjiang," and "Resist America, Aid Korea" screened by the film team are very popular among the people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas. Last year, when the team screened films in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, many viewers were Tibetan people who had ridden horses from hundreds of miles away.

    中共中央新疆分局汉族干部学习维吾尔文
    中共中央新疆分局的汉族干部努力学习维吾尔族的文字语言。依照一九五二年八月中共中央新疆分局第二届党代表会议的决议，汉族干部都应在两三年内，学会当地民族的语言文字。新疆分局的汉族干部从去年冬天即开始进行维吾尔族的语文的学习，经常参加学习的有一百多人。现在，中共中央新疆分局书记王恩茂、常务委员饶正锡等领导同志组成的学习小组，每人已经学完维吾尔文识字课本三十三课。在一般干部中，学习成绩最好的人已能初通维吾尔文字，并可作普通会话。
    青海电影放映大队到牧区巡回放映
    青海省人民政府文教厅电影放映大队，今年将进一步展开牧区的放映工作。现已有五个放映队携带大批影片、幻灯到共和县藏族自治区去轮回放映。
    这个电影放映大队是一九五一年十月成立的。一九五二年，该队曾配合各种访问团和各种工作队在都兰、祁连、同仁、河南四旗、尖扎、果洛和玉树等地区，先后共放映了四百四十一场，观众达七十五万多人。电影队放映的“中华各民族大团结”“欢乐的新疆”“抗美援朝”等影片，深受牧区各族人民欢迎。去年该队在玉树藏族自治区放映时，观众中有许多是从数百里外骑马赶来的藏族人民。
