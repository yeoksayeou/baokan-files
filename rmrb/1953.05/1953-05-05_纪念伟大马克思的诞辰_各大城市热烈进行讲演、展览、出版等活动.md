    [Report from this newspaper] This year, May 5th, is the 135th anniversary of the birth of the great thinker, the founder of scientific communism, and the teacher and leader of the world proletariat, Karl Marx. The Chinese people commemorate this giant of the ages with reverence and gratitude.
    The Chinese people love Marx's works. The People's Publishing House is preparing to publish a new edition of the Chinese translation of Marx's greatest work, "Das Kapital," this year. The first batch of 20,000 copies of the first volume of the Chinese translation of "Das Kapital" will be available to readers in major cities across the country on May 5th.
    The works of Marx and his close comrade-in-arms, Engels, have been widely circulated in China. From 1949 to the end of 1952, a total of 33 Chinese translations of important works by Marx and Engels were published. Among them, 30 were published by the People's Publishing House and Sanlian Bookstore, totaling 3,137,000 copies. The most printed of these books are "The Communist Manifesto," "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," and "The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man." The People's Publishing House is also preparing to publish eight works by Marx and thirteen works by Engels this year, totaling more than 200,000 copies.
    In Beijing, the Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Marx-Lenin Institute, Renmin University, Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and the Beijing Library, among other units, will hold commemorative lectures on the evening of the 4th or the 5th. At these lectures, comrades Yang Xianzhen and Hu Sheng from the Marx-Lenin Institute will give reports respectively. The commemorative meeting sponsored by the Beijing Library was held on the evening of the 4th at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall, where Comrade Chen Changhao from the Compilation and Translation Bureau of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's Works of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China gave a report entitled "Seriously Studying Marxism." After the report, the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic to China screened the film "The Invincible." This film depicts the struggle of the German working class for its own liberation under the banner of Marxism in the 1870s.
    The exhibition commemorating the 135th anniversary of Marx's birth, held by the Beijing Library, is scheduled to open on the 5th. The exhibition displays various photographs, books, and charts.

    【本报讯】今年五月五日是伟大的思想家、科学共产主义的创始人、世界无产阶级的导师和领袖卡尔·马克思的一百三十五周年诞辰。中国人民怀着崇敬与感激的心情纪念这位旷古的巨人。
