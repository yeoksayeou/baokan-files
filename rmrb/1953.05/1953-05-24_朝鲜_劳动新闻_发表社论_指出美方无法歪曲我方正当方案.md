    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 23rd. The "Rodong Sinmun" newspaper published an editorial on the 23rd entitled "The U.S. Should Accept Our Just Proposal," saying: The armistice negotiations, resumed under the great concern, expectation, and attention of peace-loving people worldwide, have lasted for four weeks and have encountered difficulties again due to the insincere attitude and unreasonable demands of the U.S. side. The editorial pointed out: The U.S. side's "counterproposal" is permeated with the attempt to continue detaining our captured personnel under the pretext of "on-the-spot release" and then hand them over to the Syngman Rhee gang to serve as cannon fodder. The so-called "on-the-spot release" is merely another form of forced detention that the other party has stubbornly adhered to since the beginning of the negotiations. This is a challenge to human conscience, an intolerable crime against prisoners of war, and a brutal trampling on the ardent expectations of the people on both sides whose children are participating in the Korean War. The editorial said: The legitimacy of our proposal cannot be distorted by any sophistry, slander, or "pressure," and the U.S. side's ulterior motives in obstructing the negotiations cannot be concealed by any sweet talk or deceptive tricks. The eyes of the people of the world are focused on the tent at Panmunjom. They are monitoring every move of the U.S. side with sharp eyes. If the U.S. side truly hopes to achieve world peace, it should abandon its obstinacy and so-called "pressure," and give up its delusion of gaining at the negotiating table what it failed to obtain in the war.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论
    指出美方无法歪曲我方正当方案
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】“劳动新闻”报二十三日以“美方应接受我方的正当方案”为题发表社论说：在全世界爱好和平人民的很大关切、期待和注视下恢复举行的停战谈判，已经过了四个星期，由于美方不诚恳的态度和不合理的主张，又碰到了难关。社论指出：美方在其“反建议”中所贯穿着的主张，是企图以“就地释放”为借口，继续扣留我方被俘人员，然后交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。所谓“就地释放”，只是对方从谈判之初就一直固执着的强迫扣留的另一种方式。这是对人类良心的挑战，是对战俘的无可容忍的犯罪，是对有子弟参加朝鲜战争的双方人民迫切期望的横暴蹂躏。社论说：我方方案的正当性是任何诡辩、中伤或“压力”所不能歪曲的，而美方阻挠谈判的不可告人的意图是任何花言巧语和欺瞒伎俩所不能掩饰的。全世界人民的视线正集中在板门店的帐篷。他们正以锐利的眼光监视着美方的一举一动。如果美方真正希望实现世界和平的话，就应该放弃它的固执和所谓“压力”，放弃它要在谈判中取得在战争中没能得到的东西的妄想。
