On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
People in Various Parts of North China Actively Report Mineral Deposits

The people in various parts of North China care about the economic construction of the motherland and actively report mineral deposits to the North China Geological Bureau. In the two months since its establishment (February to April), the North China Geological Bureau has received twenty-one letters reporting mineral deposits. The types of minerals include iron, coal, copper, lead, tungsten, silver, graphite, asbestos, and mica. Many people not only report clues to mineral deposits but also personally look for ore outcrops. For example, Bian Wenxue, a worker at Kailuan Coal Mine, remembered that there were hematite, chromite, and other minerals in the mountains of the fifth district of Quyang County. He personally went to the mountains to investigate, collect ore samples, and draw a sketch map, which he handed over to the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry.

The enthusiastic reporting of mineral deposits by the masses has provided rich resource materials for the country's economic construction. After investigation and research by the North China Geological Bureau, it has been proven that the minerals reported by the masses are mineral resources with exploration value. In order to further develop the work of reporting mineral deposits by the people, the North China Geological Bureau has now established a people's reporting mineral deposits group in the Geological Works Department and organized two preliminary survey teams to conduct investigations in various places based on the materials reported by the masses, so as to discover the underground treasures of the motherland more quickly and in greater quantities.

Many New Mineral Outcrops Discovered in Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Mining Area

New lead-zinc mineral outcrops are constantly being discovered in the Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Mining Area in Hunan. Shuikoushan is a famous lead-zinc mining area. Between 1912 and 1944, some Chinese geologists conducted fifteen explorations in the mining area. However, old geology could not enable people to understand the true geological conditions of the mining area; some of the drilling machines used by imperialist countries could not even penetrate the floating soil and reach the rock layer. The Kuomintang reactionary government affirmed that there were no new ore bodies in the mining area and that the resources had been exhausted.

After liberation, the Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Exploration Team began exploration in the mining area in July 1950. In the fourth quarter of 1952, trench exploration, tunnel exploration, and drilling work were fully launched. Now, the number of drilling machines in the exploration team has increased three times compared to last year, and a group of geophysical prospecting personnel has been added. In the first quarter of this year, Soviet experts conducted on-site exploration of the geological conditions in the mining area and helped the exploration team determine the main methods of exploration work and re-selected some drilling locations. Therefore, this year's exploration work has achieved greater results: a further understanding of the geological structure, the discovery of many mineralized rock layers, and in April, nearly half of the Soviet-made drilling machines discovered new mineral outcrops.

At present, geophysical prospecting work is being stepped up, and new machines will be used for tunnel exploration work. The mine is preparing to start larger-scale exploration work.

Fushun Coal Mine Successfully Trials Chemical Absorbent in Oxygen Respirators

The Fushun Coal Mine Safety Research Institute has successfully trial-produced a chemical absorbent for oxygen respirators. Oxygen respirators are necessary tools for coal mine rescue workers. In the past, the work of restoring mines in coal mines across the country completely used old-fashioned caustic soda. This medicine not only took a long time to process, but was also expensive. If used for more than an hour, the temperature of this medicine would rise to eighty to one hundred degrees, and rescue workers often felt difficulty breathing. Although Soviet-style life-saving devices have now been prepared in coal mines across the country, the number of medicines is not large due to the difficulty of trial production, resulting in a situation of supply falling short of demand. In order to solve this problem, the state handed over this task to the Chemicals Research Group of the Fushun Coal Mine Safety Research Institute for trial production in January this year. Under the leadership of the Party, all the staff of the group, after discussion and research, overcame many difficulties in the trial production process and found the knack for manufacturing, and finally successfully trial-produced a new medicine. The advantages of this new medicine are: strong absorption capacity, no major temperature change after one or two hours of use, low cost, and can save more than ten times compared with the caustic soda used in the past.

Henan Province Begins Harvesting Barley

Henan is entering the wheat harvest season. Barley is turning yellow in most areas, and wheat is starting to fill the grains. The newly grown wheat after the frost disaster is heading and flowering. Chenliu, Gongxian, Wuyang and other counties have started harvesting barley, and the harvest is good. According to farmers in Gongxian, the local barley can generally yield five dou per mu (32 jin per dou), and the best can yield nine dou. After the barley is harvested and threshed, farmers in some areas can reduce some of the difficulties of food shortage, and the problem of livestock feed can also be solved. Farmers in various villages are actively trying to overcome difficulties, add and repair agricultural tools, and welcome the wheat harvest. Some areas have launched a mass movement to protect wheat. The Henan Provincial People's Government issued a notice on May 12, calling on military and government organs, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life to pay attention to this year's wheat protection work, and effectively protect the labor income of people of all classes, strictly prevent incidents of arbitrary collection, looting, and distribution; severely punish landlords and counter-revolutionaries who attempt to counterattack and settle accounts or even gang up to grab or destroy wheat according to law; local people's armed forces should lead the militia, organize the broad masses, establish wheat protection organizations, mobilize the masses to formulate wheat protection covenants, and ensure the smooth progress of the wheat harvest.

Central Institute of Hygiene Researches and Cultivates
Riboflavin Millet Successfully

The Department of Pharmacology of the Central Institute of Hygiene experimented by inoculating riboflavin bacteria into rice. After more than ten days of cultivation, the rice grains turned yellow. After drying and analysis, it was found that every 100 grams of rice contained about 70 milligrams of riboflavin (i.e., Vitamin B2, ordinary white rice contains 0.03 to 0.04 milligrams per 100 grams). Later, the department inoculated riboflavin bacteria into millet and improved the cultivation method. Every 100 grams of millet could contain 300 milligrams of riboflavin (ordinary millet contains about 0.09 milligrams of riboflavin per 100 grams). This achievement is of great significance for solving the nutritional problems of the broad masses of people in our country.

Riboflavin is a major component for maintaining human health. Lack of it will cause diseases such as sores at the corners of the mouth, chapped lips, eye diseases, and skin diseases. In daily food, dairy milk, eggs, and liver are rich in riboflavin. Riboflavin millet can be ground into flour and mixed into ordinary flour. Adding one-third of a tael of riboflavin millet to each bag of flour will prevent people who eat this flour from lacking riboflavin. Similarly, riboflavin millet can also be mixed into other foods. The cultivation of riboflavin millet is simple and the cost is much lower than riboflavin tablets.

Zhang Huanqun, Head of Qinglong County, Rehe Province,
Goes Deep into the Masses to Summarize Production Experience

After the spring plowing preparation work began, Zhang Huanqun, head of Qinglong County People's Government, Rehe Province, led a working group to the seventh district, visited many village cadres and experienced farmers, and conducted on-the-spot investigations in the fields to help farmers summarize local high-yield experiences. After many days of hard work, he proposed a new planting method of rational close planting, equidistant full seedlings to farmers, and improved the methods of seeders as well as plowing, planting, and fertilizing.

In order to quickly promote the new planting method throughout the county, Zhang Huanqun also adopted the method of cultivating key points and using points to lead the area: first, he used Gaolipu Village as the key village in the seventh district to test the new planting method, and the whole village used the Tong Fengxi mutual aid team as the key team for testing, and then mobilized the heads of various mutual aid teams in the village to visit and learn. In this way, the new planting method was quickly promoted throughout the village. Then, cadres and mutual aid team representatives from the surrounding villages visited Gaolipu Village to learn and promote it back home. Because each district promoted this method, the planting work throughout the county was completed in a timely manner.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    华北区各地人民积极报矿
    华北区各地人民群众关怀祖国的经济建设，纷纷向华北地质局报矿。华北地质局成立两月（二月到四月）来，就收到了二十一封报矿信。矿样种类有铁、煤、铜、铅、钨、银、石墨、石棉、云母等。很多人不但报告矿藏线索，还亲自找矿苗。如开滦煤矿工人边文学，想起曲阳县五区山里有赤铁矿、铬铁矿等矿，就亲自到山上调查、采矿样，并画了草图交给河北省工业厅。
    群众的踊跃报矿，给国家经济建设提供了丰富的资源材料，经华北地质局派人调查研究结果，证明群众所报的矿，都是一些有探勘价值的矿产资源。为使人民群众报矿工作更加开展起来，华北地质局现在已在地质工务处设立了人民群众报矿组，并组织了两个预查队，根据群众报矿材料去各地进行调查，以便更快地更多地发现祖国的地下宝藏。

    水口山铅锌矿区发现很多新矿苗
    湖南水口山铅锌矿区内，不断地发现新的铅锌矿苗。水口山是著名的铅锌矿区。在一九一二年到一九四四年之间，我国的一些地质学家曾在矿区内作过十五次勘探。但是，旧的地质学，不能使人了解矿区地质的真实情况；所用的帝国主义国家的钻探机，有些还钻不透浮土，达不到岩层。国民党反动政府就肯定矿区内没有新的矿体，资源已经枯竭。
    解放以后，水口山铅锌勘探队从一九五○年七月起，就在矿区内进行勘探。一九五二年第四季，全面地展开了槽探、洞探和钻探工作。现在，勘探队的钻机比去年增加了三倍，并且增加了一批物理探矿人员。今年第一季度内，苏联专家曾实地勘探了矿区内的地质情况，帮助勘探队确定了勘探工作的主要方法，重新选定了一些钻孔位置。因此，今年的勘探工作获得了更大的成绩：进一步了解了地质构造，发现了很多矿化岩层，四月份，有将近一半的苏联造钻机发现了新矿苗。
    现在，物理探矿工作正加紧进行，洞探工作将采用新式机器。该矿正准备开始更大规模的勘探工作。
    抚顺煤矿试制氧气呼吸器中的
    化学吸收剂成功
    抚顺煤矿安全研究所，试制氧气呼吸器中的化学吸收剂成功。氧气呼吸器是煤矿救护人员所必需的工具。过去全国各煤矿的恢复矿井工作，完全使用旧式苛性钠，这种药品不但加工费时间，价钱也贵。使用超过一小时，这种药品温度就上升到八十到一百度，救护人员常常感到呼吸困难。现在全国各煤矿虽已置备了苏联式救命器，但因试制困难，药品数量不多，产生了供不应求现象。为解决这一问题，今年一月，国家把这一任务交给了抚顺煤矿安全研究所化学品研究组试制。该组全体职工在党的领导下，经过讨论和研究，在试制过程中克服了很多困难，找到制造的窍门，终于试制成功一种新药品。这种新药品的优点是：吸收能力较强，使用一、二小时温度没有大变化，成本低，制成品和过去使用的苛性钠比较，可节省十倍多。

    河南省各地开始收割大麦
    河南各地即将进入麦收季节。大部地区大麦已黄，小麦开始灌浆饱籽，受冻灾后新生长起来的麦子正吐穗扬花。陈留、巩县、舞阳等县的大麦已开始收割，收成还好。据巩县农民谈，今年当地大麦一般每亩地可收五斗（每斗三十二斤），最好的可收九斗。大麦收割打场之后，部分地区的农民即可减少一些缺粮的困难，牲口饲料问题也可以解决。各村农民正积极设法克服困难，添置和修理农具，迎接麦收。有些地区已经开展群众性的护麦运动。河南省人民政府在五月十二日发布了布告，号召各地军政机关、人民团体、各界人民重视今年的护麦工作，切实保护各阶层人民的劳动所得，严防乱收、乱抢、乱分的事件发生；对妄图反攻倒算甚至结伙抢麦、毁麦的不法地主、反革命分子，依法予以严惩；各地人民武装应领导民兵，组织广大群众，建立护麦组织，发动群众制订护麦公约，保证麦收顺利进行。
    中央卫生研究院研究培育
    核黄小米成功
    中央卫生研究院药物学系试验以核黄菌接种于大米，经过十多天的培养，米粒变为黄色，干燥后加以分析，发现每一百克大米中约含七十毫克的核黄素（即二号乙种维生素，普通白米每一百克中含点零三毫克到点零四毫克）。后来该系又将核黄菌接种于小米，并改进培育方法，在每一百克的小米中可含三百毫克的核黄素（普通小米每一百克中约含点零九毫克的核黄素）。这一成就，对解决我国广大人民的营养问题有重大意义。
    核黄素为保持人体健康的一种主要成分。缺少了它就会产生嘴角、嘴唇溃烂，眼病和皮肤病等疾病。在日常食物中，核黄素含量丰富的有牛乳、鸡蛋、肝等。核黄小米磨成粉后，可以搀入普通面粉内。在每袋面粉内搀入三分之一两的核黄小米，食用这种面粉的人就不会缺乏核黄素。同样。核黄小米也可搀在其他食物里面。核黄小米的培育手续简单，比起核黄素药片来，成本低廉得多。

    热河省青龙县县长张唤群
    深入群众总结生产经验
    热河省青龙县人民政府县长张唤群，在春耕准备工作开始后，率领工作组深入到第七区，访问了许多村干部和有经验的农民，并到田间实地调查，帮助农民总结当地的丰产经验。经过好些天的努力，他给农民提出了合理密植、等距全苗的新播种法，并改进了播种器以及扶犁、播种、施肥的方法。
    为了很快地把新播种法在全县推广，张唤群又采用了培养重点、以点带面的办法：首先以高丽铺村作为第七区的重点村试验新播种法，全村又以佟凤喜互助组为重点组进行试验，然后发动村内各互助组组长参观学习。这样，新播种法很快就在全村推广开来。接着，周围各村的干部和互助组代表又到高丽铺村参观学习，回去推广。由于各区都推行这一方法，全县播种工作及时完成。
