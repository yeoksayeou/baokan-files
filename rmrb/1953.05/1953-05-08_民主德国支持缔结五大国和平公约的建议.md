    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 7th: According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin on May 7th, the German News Agency reported that the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, wrote to Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, and Nenni and Wirth, members of the International Committee of the World People's Peace Congress, expressing support for the World People's Peace Congress' letter to the governments of the five major powers, suggesting that the five major powers hold consultations to conclude a peace pact. Grotewohl said in the letter: The government of the German Democratic Republic and all the German people warmly support the letter to the governments of the five major powers, adopted by the Vienna World People's Peace Congress in December 1952, which calls for the conclusion of a peace pact between the five major powers. The conclusion of a five-power peace pact is of particular importance to the German people, because easing the international situation through negotiations will also help to peacefully resolve the German question. This will undoubtedly accelerate the realization of the German people's firm demand for the establishment of a unified, independent, peace-loving and democratic Germany, for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and subsequently for the withdrawal of occupation troops. The government of the German Democratic Republic resolutely adopts a policy aimed at achieving this goal, and therefore wholeheartedly supports the World People's Peace Congress' letter to the governments of the five major powers. The government of the German Democratic Republic hopes that the governments of the five major powers will respond to the World People's Peace Congress' call for the conclusion of a peace pact.

    民主德国支持缔结五大国和平公约的建议
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林七日讯：德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥代表德意志民主共和国政府，写信给世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里及世界人民和平大会国际委员会委员南尼和维尔特，表示支持世界人民和平大会建议五大国举行协商以缔结和平公约的致五大国政府书。格罗提渥在信中说：德意志民主共和国政府及全德国人民，热烈拥护一九五二年十二月维也纳世界人民和平大会所通过的要求五大国缔结和平公约的致五大国政府书。缔结五大国和平公约对于德国人民说来是特别重要的，因为通过谈判来缓和国际局面也就能够有助于和平解决德国问题。这无疑将加速实现德国人民的坚决要求，德国人民坚决要求建立统一、独立、爱好和平与民主的德国，要求缔结对德和约并随后撤退占领军。德意志民主共和国政府坚决采取这种旨在达到这种目标的政策，因此它全心全意地支持世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书。德意志民主共和国政府希望五大国政府答复世界人民和平大会要求缔结和平公约的呼吁。
