Reader Letters Summary

    Two-Week Reader Letters Handling Situation

    From April 13th to April 26th, the reader letters group of this newspaper received a total of 3,706 reader letters, and various agencies replied to 670 letters. Among them, 1,581 were related to political and legal issues, 1,571 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 1,158 were related to cultural and educational issues, and 66 were of other nature. 73 were published in this newspaper, 1,040 were individually replied to the readers, 2,660 were transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, handling, reply, or reference, and 1,443 were retained by this newspaper for reference or did not require further handling; some of these are letters left over from the past. During this period, the reader letters group of this newspaper sent out a total of 5,852 replies to readers, transfers to relevant agencies for investigation and handling, and follow-up letters. In addition, there were 896 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers seeking revolutionary soldiers, which were not included in the statistics.

    During these two weeks, we received many letters from people all over the country expressing their condolences to the sick and wounded captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were being repatriated. The readers expressed their infinite concern and congratulations to the sick and wounded captured personnel who were unfortunately captured in the heroic struggle to defend world peace and the security of the motherland, who persisted in their unyielding struggle under the savage massacre and persecution of the enemy, and who are now about to return to the warm embrace of the motherland. We plan to publish excerpts of some of these letters.

    In the letters related to rural work, many readers reflected the problems existing in some county and district leaders' work in spring plowing production and the promotion of new agricultural tools, pesticides, and advanced production experiences. We have selected some of them for publication in the newspaper; some readers exposed the poor relationship between some state-owned farms and the local people, which we are studying; some readers also reported on the local production situation, but because the content was not specific enough, we generally kept them for reference. In addition, many readers promptly reflected the serious situation of wheat frost damage in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and other places. Because the relevant central departments have already paid attention to and dealt with this issue, these letters were kept for reference and no further action was taken.

    In the letters related to industry and transportation, readers exposed the situation that some industrial and mining and water conservancy engineering departments did not pay attention to rationalization proposals; exposed the situation that some light industrial factories could not complete the April production plan, which affected market supply; and criticized some shipping units for arbitrarily proposing transportation plans but actually failing to complete them, which disrupted the national transportation plan and caused waste of railway cars. We are currently studying the above letters.

    In the letters related to finance and cooperation, readers continued to expose the situation that some units violated national financial discipline, and we have selected some of them for publication; readers criticized the problems in the operation and management of some cooperatives, and we plan to select some of them for publication; some readers also reported illegal acts of some private merchants evading national taxes, which we are studying and handling.

    In the letters related to cultural and educational work, many students and staff of universities and colleges reflected some problems in the school teaching reform and the situation that the students' coursework in some schools was too heavy and the school did not pay enough attention to the students' health. These letters generally lacked sufficient materials, and we have selected some of the more important ones to ask the readers to supplement them so that they can be published publicly. Some readers have made some suggestions on enrollment, graduate assignment, and teaching work, which we have forwarded to the relevant leading departments for reference. Some readers have also raised some questions about the enrollment of over-aged children and the enrollment of people with physical defects, and we plan to study and answer them together with the relevant agencies.

    In addition, many readers have reflected that they cannot find jobs and have difficulties in life after coming to the city from the countryside, and they have requested this newspaper to help solve the problem. We believe that these readers should abide by the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Persuading Peasants to Stop Blindly Flowing into Cities" and quickly return to their hometowns to actively engage in agricultural production; those who have difficulties in returning home and currently have difficulties in life can ask the civil affairs departments of the local people's government for subsidies and relief. Some readers have reflected that the labor employment committees in some places do not pay attention to conducting education work for registered unemployed people, and that some departments have excessively high requirements when recruiting staff, resulting in the fact that many unemployed people cannot be employed quickly. We have summarized this and will soon forward it to the Central Labor Employment Committee for research.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    两周读者来信处理情况
    四月十三日到二十六日，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信三千七百零六件，各机关答复读者的信六百七十件。其中有关政法问题的一千五百八十一件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的一千五百七十一件，有关文教问题的一千一百五十八件，其它性质的六十六件。在本报发表的七十三件，个别答复读者的一千零四十件，转请各有关机关调查、处理、答复或参考的二千六百六十件，留存本报参考以及不需再作处理的一千四百四十三件；这里有一部分是以前留下的来信。在这一时期中，本报读者来信组共发出答复读者、转请有关机关调查处理和催办信五千八百五十二件。此外，还有革命军人家属寻找革命军人的信八百九十六件，数字未统计在内。
    这两周中，我们收到各地人民写给被遣返的中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员的慰问信多件。读者们对于在保卫世界和平与祖国安全的英勇斗争中不幸被俘、在敌人野蛮的屠杀和迫害下坚持不屈地斗争，而现在即将回到祖国温暖怀抱的病伤被俘人员们，寄与无限的关怀和祝贺。这些来信，我们准备摘要发表一部分。
    在有关农村工作的来信中，不少读者反映了某些县区领导春耕生产以及推广新农具、农药和先进生产经验工作中所存在的问题，我们已选择一部分在报上发表；有些读者揭发某些地方国营农场与当地群众关系不好的情况，我们正进行研究；还有些读者来信报告当地生产情况，因为内容都不够具体，我们一般都留存参考。此外，有许多读者及时地反映了河南、安徽、江苏、山东等地小麦遭受霜灾的严重情况，因中央有关部门对这个问题已经重视处理，这些来信即留作参考，不再处理。
    在有关工业、交通的来信中，读者揭发了某些工矿、水利工程部门不重视合理化建议的情况；揭发了某些轻工业工厂不能完成四月份生产计划，以致影响市场供应的情况；批评了某些托运单位任意提出运输计划而实际上完不成，以致打乱国家运输计划、造成车皮浪费。以上来信，我们都正进行研究。
    在有关财政、合作的来信中，读者继续揭发某些单位违反国家财政纪律的情况，我们已选择一部分发表；读者批评某些合作社经营管理中的问题，我们准备选择一部分发表；还有些读者检举某些私商偷漏国税的非法行为，我们正在研究处理。
    在有关文化教育工作的来信中，不少大、专学校的学生和工作人员反映了学校教学改革中的一些问题以及某些学校学生课业太重和校方对学生健康重视不够的情况，这些来信一般都缺乏充实的材料，我们已选择比较重要的一部分函请读者补充，以便公开发表。有些读者对招生工作、毕业生分配工作及教学工作提出了一些建议，我们已转请有关领导部门参考。还有些读者提出了有关超龄儿童入学问题和有生理缺陷者入学问题的一些疑问，我们准备和有关机关共同研究解答。
    此外，还有不少读者反映他们从农村来到城市后无法找得职业，生活发生困难，要求本报协助解决。我们认为，这些读者应该遵照政务院“关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示”，迅速回乡积极从事农业生产；其回乡路费和目前生活确有困难者，可向所在地的人民政府民政部门要求补助和救济。有些读者反映某些地方的劳动就业委员会对已登记的失业人员不重视进行教育工作，以及某些部门录用工作人员时要求过高、致使不少失业人员不能迅速就业的情况，我们已经综合，即将转请中央劳动就业委员会研究。
