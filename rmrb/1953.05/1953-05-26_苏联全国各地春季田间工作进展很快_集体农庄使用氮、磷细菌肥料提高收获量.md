Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 22nd: News of the progress of spring field work across the Soviet Union continues to arrive. In the central and northwestern regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, and in the Urals and Siberia, grain sowing is nearing completion. Dozens of states in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic have completed their grain sowing plans. Collective farms in the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (in the Caucasus) have completed their sowing plans ahead of schedule. Spring wheat has begun to sprout in the southern regions. In many states in the central zone, wheat seedlings are growing densely and evenly. Many states are continuing to sow late-maturing crops. For example, millet is being sown in Chkalov Oblast, and buckwheat is being sown in Ukraine.

Recently, warm weather and abundant rainfall have caused row crops to grow rapidly. Agricultural workers have begun inter-row cultivation of corn, sunflower, and sugar beet crops. In cotton-growing areas, people are inspecting cotton seedlings and replanting in sparse areas. Advanced collective farms and state farms in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic have carried out the second inter-row cultivation of cotton fields.

The southern regions of the Soviet Union are stepping up preparations for the harvest of winter crops. The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic has begun harvesting winter barley. In southern Kyrgyzstan and southern Kazakhstan, the machine harvesting of pasture grass has begun. Spring sheep shearing has begun in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic and Stavropol Krai. In the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, three thousand electric shears are in operation; according to the quota, one person shears the wool of forty sheep per day, and some shear up to one hundred and fifty. State farms in Stavropol Krai will shear 21,000 more sheep than last year, and advanced farms shear an average of six kilograms of fine wool from each sheep.

Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: According to TASS, Moscow: This year, collective farms in the Soviet Union have widely used bacterial fertilizers on hundreds of thousands of hectares (one hectare equals fifteen mu) of land. Among these bacterial fertilizers is a nitrogen bacterial fertilizer, which helps plants absorb nitrogen from the air and soil. It is the most effective fertilizer for increasing the yield of sugar beets, root crops, legumes, and pasture grass. Using only half a kilogram of nitrogen bacterial fertilizer per hectare can result in a bumper harvest. In addition, collective farms in the Soviet Union have also used phosphorus bacterial fertilizer, which helps plants absorb phosphorus from the soil. After using this fertilizer on the land, the yield of grain can be increased by 200-300 kilograms per hectare, and the yield of vegetables can be increased by 60% to 70%. In order to make the soil more fertile and continuously increase the yield per unit area, the Soviet Agricultural Microbiology Research Institute is also studying other types of bacterial fertilizers.

    苏联全国各地春季田间工作进展很快
    集体农庄使用氮、磷细菌肥料提高收获量
    【新华社莫斯科二十二日电】苏联全国各地纷纷传来春季田间工作进展情况的消息。在苏联欧洲部分的中央和西北地区，在乌拉尔和西伯利亚，谷物播种工作将近完成。俄罗斯联邦共和国几十个州已完成谷物播种计划。卡巴尔达自治共和国（在高加索）的集体农庄已提前完成了播种计划。南部地区春小麦已经开始出苗。在中央地带的许多州，麦苗长得又密又齐。许多州正在继续播种晚熟作物。例如契卡洛夫州正在播种粟，乌克兰播着荞麦。
    近来，暖和的气候和充足的雨水，使中耕作物长得很快。农业工人已开始在玉蜀黍、向日葵、甜菜作物行间进行中耕。在植棉地区，人们正在检查棉苗，在稀疏的地方进行补种。乌兹别克共和国和塔吉克共和国的先进集体农庄和国营农场已在棉地进行第二次行间耕作。
    苏联南部地区正在加紧准备收获冬种作物。塔吉克共和国已开始收割冬大麦。在吉尔吉斯南部和哈萨克南部已开始用机器收割牧草。哈萨克共和国和斯塔夫罗波尔州开始了春季剪羊毛的工作。哈萨克共和国有三千把电剪在工作着，按照定额，一人一天剪四十只羊的羊毛，有人剪到了一百五十只。斯塔夫罗波尔州国营农场将比去年多剪二万一千只羊的羊毛，先进农场从一只羊身上平均剪六公斤细毛。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：今年，苏联的集体农庄有几十万公顷（一公顷合十五亩）的田地普遍使用了细菌肥料。在这些细菌肥料中，有一种是氮细菌肥料，它能够帮助植物从空气和土壤中吸收氮素。它是提高甜菜、根类作物、豆类作物和牧草收获量的最有效的肥料。每公顷田地只要用半公斤氮细菌肥料，就可以丰收。此外，苏联集体农庄的田地上还使用了可以帮助植物从土壤中吸收磷素的磷细菌肥料。土地上使用这种肥料以后，每公顷谷物的产量可以增加二、三百公斤，蔬菜的产量可以提高百分之六十到七十。为了使土壤变得更加肥沃，并使土地的单位面积产量不断提高，苏联农业微生物学研究所还在研究其他种类的细菌肥料。
