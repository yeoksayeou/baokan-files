Comrades Delegates, Honored Guests, Comrades:

    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is now open.

    This congress is the first national congress of trade unions of our Chinese working class after the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It is an event of great significance in the historical process of the Chinese workers' movement. In addition to the representatives of trade unions from all over the country, representatives from the People's Government and various sectors are present to provide guidance, and representatives of Chinese railway transportation workers volunteering to aid Korea are also participating. What makes us particularly happy and honored is that our congress also has representatives from trade unions from various countries around the world. There is a delegation headed by Comrade Saillant from the World Federation of Trade Unions—the leading body of the world's trade union movement—which strives for the unity of the world's working class and has made unremitting efforts and significant contributions to defending world peace. There is a delegation from the trade unions of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, our closest and greatest ally of the Chinese people. There are delegations from trade unions of various People's Democratic Republics and the German Democratic Republic. There are also delegations from various trade union organizations in many countries in Asia, Australia, and France. Therefore, our congress not only demonstrates the victorious unity of the Chinese working class but also demonstrates the great friendship and unity between the Chinese working class and the world's working class. We warmly welcome the presence and guidance of all guests from home and abroad! We warmly celebrate the opening of this victorious, united, and grand congress!

    Our Sixth National Labor Congress was held in Harbin in August 1948. The great historical task stipulated by that congress—to mobilize the national working class to unite the people of the whole country to support the revolutionary war to liberate all of China—has been successfully completed. (Applause) After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the great Chinese people and the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, with the fraternal and selfless assistance of the government and people of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and with the trust, sympathy, and support of the people's democratic countries and the working classes and peoples of all countries around the world, have carried out a series of huge economic recovery efforts and achieved brilliant successes. At the same time, we have carried out the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, the land reform movement, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries throughout the country. We have conducted the "Three-Anti" movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in all state organs and social organizations, the "Five-Anti" movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic information by illegal capitalists, as well as the democratic reform movement in national enterprises. All of this has powerfully defended and consolidated the most precious fruits of victory of our Chinese working class and the Chinese people—the people's democratic dictatorship. We have not only restored production under difficult post-war conditions but also made a series of efforts to increase labor productivity and equipment utilization, launched extensive activities of invention and creation and learning from advanced experiences, increased the quantity and quality of products, and reduced production costs, thereby enabling industry and transportation to rapidly reach and exceed the highest levels before liberation. We have created the necessary conditions for the country's planned economic construction. A new great historical period for the Chinese people—the period of the country's planned economic construction—has unfolded before us. We celebrate the convening of this congress, and we greet the beginning of the period of national economic construction and the new great historical tasks of the Chinese working class with boundless enthusiasm and confidence.

    Our congress will summarize the experience of the national trade union work since the Sixth National Labor Congress, especially during the entire period of national economic recovery after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and on this basis, in accordance with the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party, formulate the trade union's guidelines and tasks for the future period of planned economic construction.

    Our congress will revise the Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and re-elect the national leading body of the Chinese trade unions to strengthen the leadership of the national trade unions, further develop the national workers' movement, and ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the tasks of national economic construction.

    Comrades! Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese workers' movement, after thirty years of arduous struggle, together with the people of the whole country, and with the support of the great Soviet Union and the working classes and all progressive forces of the world, has finally achieved the great victory of the national revolution. The victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people is the victory of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in China. Without Marxism-Leninism, without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, there would be no victory for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. The great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party is the guarantee of our victory. The great Comrade Mao Zedong is the banner of the victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. This is a most profound and simple truth that the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have realized in their own long struggle. To consolidate the victories we have achieved, to continuously move from victory to new victories, we must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin more diligently, and study the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union more diligently and better to build our country.

    The interests of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people are completely consistent with the interests of the working classes and peoples of all countries in the world. The Chinese trade union is a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese trade union has played an active role in the unification and solidarity of the international workers' movement and in defending peace in the Far East and the world. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class is not only a great patriot but also a great internationalist. In the future struggle to continue consolidating our victories and strive for greater victories, the Chinese working class will further promote the spirit of combining high patriotism with internationalism. On the one hand, we will unite the people of the whole country to work hard in production and build our great country. At the same time, we must work harder to unite with the working classes of all countries in the world, further play an active role in the world workers' movement, and fight to defend the unity and solidarity of the world workers' movement and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    The Chinese working class firmly believes that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party—the party of the Chinese working class—and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, with our close, eternal, and solid alliance with our broad peasant brothers and the unity of the people of all walks of life in the country, coupled with our eternal and unbreakable friendly cooperation with our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democratic countries, and with the friendship and solidarity between us and all peace-loving people and those who are fighting for justice in the world, we will be invincible.

    Long live the great Chinese people!
    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great Chinese working class!
    Long live the party of the Chinese working class—the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people!
    Long live the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin!
    Long live the solidarity of the working classes of the world!

    刘宁一各位代表、各位来宾、各位同志：
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会现在开幕了。
    这次大会，是我们中国工人阶级在中国人民民主革命胜利，建立了中华人民共和国以后的第一次全国工会代表大会。在中国工人运动的历史进程中，是一个具有重大意义的事件。参加这次大会的，除了全国工会的代表以外，还有人民政府及各方面的代表莅临指导，有志愿援朝的中国铁路运输工人的代表参加。使我们感到特别高兴和引为荣幸的是：我们这次大会还有世界各国工会的代表参加。有为世界工人阶级的团结统一而斗争，并为保卫世界和平作了不懈的努力和重大贡献的——世界工会运动的领导机关——世界工联的以赛扬同志为首的代表团参加；有我们中国人民最亲密的和最伟大的盟邦——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的工会的代表团参加；有各人民民主共和国和德意志民主共和国工会的代表团参加；还有亚洲、澳洲和法国许多国家各个工会团体的代表团参加。因此，我们的大会，不但表现出中国工人阶级的胜利的团结，而且表现出中国工人阶级与世界工人阶级的伟大的友谊和团结。我们热烈地欢迎国内外各位来宾的光临和指导！我们热烈地庆祝这个胜利的、团结的、盛大的大会的开幕！
    我们的第六次全国劳动大会是在一九四八年八月在哈尔滨召开的。那次大会所规定的动员全国工人阶级团结全国人民支援解放全中国的革命战争的伟大历史任务，已经胜利地完成了。（鼓掌）在中华人民共和国成立以后，伟大的中国人民和中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导之下，在我们伟大的盟邦苏联政府和苏联人民的兄弟般的慷慨无私的帮助之下，在各人民民主国家和全世界各国工人阶级和人民的信任、同情和支持之下，进行了一系列的巨大的经济恢复的工作，取得了辉煌的成就；同时，在全国范围内进行了伟大的抗美援朝运动、土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动，在一切国家机关和社会团体中进行了反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的“三反”运动，对资产阶级的不法分子进行的反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家资财、反对盗窃国家经济情报的“五反”运动，以及在全国企业中进行了民主改革运动。这一切，都有力地保卫和巩固着我们中国工人阶级和中国人民最宝贵的胜利果实——人民民主专政。我们不但在战后的困难条件下恢复了生产的进行，并且用一系列的努力来提高了劳动的生产率和设备的利用率，展开了发明创造和学习先进经验的广泛活动，提高了产品的数量和质量，降低了生产的成本，从而使工业和运输业迅速达到了和超过了解放前的最高水平。我们已经为国家的有计划的经济建设创造了必要的条件。中国人民的一个新的伟大的历史时期——国家的有计划的经济建设时期，已经展开在我们的面前了。我们庆祝这次大会的召开，我们以无限的热情和信心来迎接国家经济建设时期的开始，迎接中国工人阶级的新的伟大的历史任务。
    我们的大会将总结第六次全国劳动大会以后，特别是中华人民共和国成立以后的整个国民经济恢复时期的全国工会工作的经验，并在这样的基础上，按照中国共产党的指示，制定今后的有计划的经济建设时期的工会的方针和任务。
    我们的大会将修订中华全国总工会的章程，并将重新选举中国工会的全国领导机关，以便加强全国工会的领导，进一步开展全国工人运动，保证完成和超额完成国家经济建设的任务。
    同志们！中国工人运动在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，经过了三十年艰苦的斗争，和全国人民一起，在伟大的苏联和全世界工人阶级及一切进步力量的支持下，终于获得了全国革命的伟大胜利。中国工人阶级和中国人民的胜利，就是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说在中国的胜利。没有马克思、列宁主义，没有中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导，就不会有中国工人阶级和中国人民的胜利。伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党是我们胜利的保证。伟大的毛泽东同志是中国工人阶级和中国人民胜利的旗帜。这已是中国工人阶级和中国人民在自己长期斗争的切身经验中所体会的一条最深刻也是最简单的真理。我们要巩固已得的胜利，要不断地从胜利走向新的胜利，就必须更加紧紧地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的周围，更加努力学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，更加努力地和更好地学习苏联的先进经验，来建设我们的国家。
    中国工人阶级和中国人民的利益，和全世界工人阶级和各国人民的利益是完全一致的。中国工会是世界工联之一员，在世界工联的领导下，中国工会对于国际工人运动的统一和团结，对于保卫远东和世界的和平，曾经起了积极的作用。中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，不但是伟大的爱国主义者同时是伟大的国际主义者。在今后继续巩固我们已得的胜利，并争取更大的胜利的斗争中，中国工人阶级更将发扬高度的爱国主义和国际主义相一致的精神，一方面团结全国人民努力生产，努力建设我们伟大的国家，同时要更加努力地与世界各国工人阶级团结一致，进一步在世界工人运动中发挥积极的作用，为保卫世界工人运动的统一、团结而斗争，为保卫远东和世界的和平而斗争。
    中国工人阶级坚信：在中国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导之下，在我们与广大农民弟兄的亲密的、永远的、巩固的联盟以及和全国各界人民的团结之下，加上我们和伟大的盟邦——苏联以及各人民民主国家的永恒的牢不可破的友好合作，又加上我们和世界一切爱好和平与为正义事业而斗争的人民的友谊和团结，我们将是无往而不胜的。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国工人阶级万岁！
    中国工人阶级的政党——伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国工人阶级和中国人民的伟大领袖——毛泽东同志万岁！
    伟大的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说万岁！
    全世界工人阶级团结万岁！
