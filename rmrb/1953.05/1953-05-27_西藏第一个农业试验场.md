Anyone who has visited the fields near the "August 1st" Farm in the western suburbs of Lhasa, whether they are suburban farmers, Lhasa citizens, lamas from monasteries, or officials of the Tibetan local government, is excited about a new phenomenon: many new vegetables and crops are growing in the agricultural experiment farm of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

This agricultural experiment farm is where agricultural scientists sent to Tibet by the Central People's Government and students from the Agricultural Technology Cadre Training Class of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army conduct field experiments. Now, as people approach the experimental farm, they can see various meteorological instruments of the experimental farm's weather station standing in the vast fields along the Lhasa River. The experimental farm is surrounded by green seedling fields and rows of neat hotbeds. Next to each nursery and hotbed, there are exquisite small wooden signs indicating the names and origins of various crops and vegetables, including lotus white cabbage from Beijing and the Northwest, cantaloupe from Lanzhou and Hami, watermelon from Dali, Shaanxi, winter wheat from the Northwest and Soviet Ukraine, as well as more than fifty varieties of spring wheat and ten different varieties of crops such as corn, sorghum, and buckwheat. There are also more than twenty kinds of vegetables such as pumpkins, eggplants, cowpeas, and peppers, as well as alfalfa, oats, and timothy grass from the Northwest, Inner Mongolia, and Soviet varieties. These varieties have various characteristics such as early maturity, resistance to weeds, drought resistance, and cold resistance, and are now growing very well. The trial-planted winter wheat has grown more than 20 centimeters high, and many vegetables have also been transplanted from the hotbeds, and their maturity period will be one month earlier than local vegetables. The growth of pasture is also very good. The growth of these crops unfolds a beautiful vision for the future of agricultural development in Tibet.

Last year, agricultural experts who came to Tibet conducted investigations and research on climate, soil, crop varieties, and cultivation methods in the grassland and river valley areas nearly two thousand miles on the Kangzang Plateau. They saw hardworking Tibetan farmers planting highland barley and radish and other vegetables on slopes 4,400 meters above sea level, and planting wheat and potatoes and other crops on highlands 3,800 meters above sea level. They collected a large number of plant specimens and more than 150 kinds of crop seeds. Preliminary research has proved that many drought-resistant and cold-resistant crops can adapt to the plateau climate and soil environment.

Last year, the agricultural production of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Lhasa Plain achieved a bumper harvest. Each red-skinned autumn radish weighed up to 19 jin, and each cabbage weighed more than 10 jin. This year, the agricultural experiment farm has absorbed last year's experience and carried out cultivation entirely by scientific methods. Now the vegetables and crops in the field are growing better day by day. Farmers in the surrounding villages and citizens of Lhasa often come here to visit with concern. They carefully inquire about the names and origins of the crops from the staff, some ask the experimental farm for seeds, and some ask the staff to go to their gardens in person to teach them new cultivation methods. After Kalon Doga Pengtso Rapga of the Tibetan local government visited the agricultural experiment farm, he excitedly said to the staff of the farm: "The Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army entering Tibet are so meticulous in their concern for Tibet's construction undertakings. I hope you will teach these agricultural production technologies and scientific knowledge to the vast Tibetan farmers."

    西藏第一个农业试验场
    凡是来过拉萨西郊“八一”农场附近田野里的人们，无论是郊区农民、拉萨市民、寺院里的喇嘛或西藏地方政府的官员，都为一个新的事物感到兴奋：中国人民解放军的农业试验场里正生长着许多新的蔬菜和庄稼。
    这个农业试验场，是中央人民政府派到西藏来的农业科学家，和中国人民解放军西藏军区农业技术干部训练班的学员们，进行田野实验的场所。现在，当人们走近试验场的时候，便可以看到试验场气象台的各种测候仪器，耸立在拉萨河畔广阔的田野里，试验场的周围，有着一片绿色的苗田和一排排整齐的温床。在每个苗圃和温床的旁边，插着精致的小木牌，上面标明了各种作物、蔬菜的名称和来源，其中有北京和西北的莲花白，兰州和哈密的甜瓜，陕西大荔的西瓜，西北和苏联乌克兰的冬小麦，以及五十多种品种的春小麦和十几种不同品种的玉米、高粱、荞麦等作物，还有南瓜、茄子、豇豆、辣椒等二十几种蔬菜，和西北、内蒙、苏联品种的苜蓿、燕麦、猫尾草等牧草。这些品种都具有早熟、抗莠、抗旱、耐寒等各种不同的特性，现在都生长得非常良好。试种的冬小麦已经长了二十多公分高，许多蔬菜也从温床里移植出来了，它们的成熟期将比本地蔬菜提早一个月。牧草的生长情况也非常良好。这些作物的生长情形，给西藏的农业发展前途，展开了一幅美丽的远景。
    到西藏的农业专家们，去年在康藏高原上近两千华里的草原河谷地带，进行了气候、土壤和作物品种、耕作方法的调查研究工作，他们看见勤劳的藏族农民，在拔海四千四百公尺的山坡上种植着青稞和萝卜等菜蔬，在三千八百公尺的高地上种植小麦和马铃薯等作物的情景。他们采集了大批的植物标本和一百五十多类作物的种子。经过初步研究，证明有很多抗旱、耐寒的作物，能适应高原气候和土壤环境。
    去年，中国人民解放军在拉萨平原上的农业生产得到了丰收。红皮秋萝卜每个重达十九斤，包心白菜每个重十斤以上。今年农业试验场吸取了去年的经验，并完全用科学方法进行栽培。现在场里的菜蔬和作物，一天比一天长得美好。周围村子里的农民和拉萨的市民，时常关心地跑到这里来看望，他们向工作人员仔细地询问作物的名称、产地，有的向试验场要种子，有些人要求工作人员亲自到他们园里去，教给他们新的栽培方法。西藏地方政府噶伦朵噶·彭错饶杰参观了农业试验场以后，对该场的工作人员兴奋地说：“中央人民政府和进藏的中国人民解放军，对西藏建设事业的关心，真是无微不至，希望你们把这些农业生产技术和科学知识，教给广大的藏族农民。”    （新华社）
