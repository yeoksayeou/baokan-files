    State-Owned Commerce Should Strive to Open Up Sales Channels for Local and Special Products

    Currently, it is the off-season for trade, and coupled with the insufficient work done in the first quarter on material exchange, as well as other reasons, the sales channels for certain local and special products have not yet been opened up. This is very detrimental to agricultural production and disaster relief efforts. According to incomplete data, the commonly overstocked local and special products include homespun cloth, homemade sugar, native alkali, local tobacco, tung oil, pig bristles, reed mats, sulfur, rosin, and medicinal herbs. Localized overstocked products include live pigs, cellophane noodles, native paper, raw lacquer, sugarcane, sunflower seeds, black melon seeds, black dates, red dates, fennel seeds, pickled radishes, cattail flower spikes, wild silkworm cocoons, straw hats, ramie cloth, bamboo pulp, and some handicrafts. We must actively open up sales channels for these overstocked local and special products in order to invigorate the urban and rural economy and support spring plowing production and disaster relief work.

    Our country's rural local and special products are very abundant, and they have a significant relationship with the production and life of the vast number of farmers. In general areas, the production of local and special products accounts for about 30% or more of the total value of agricultural production. In some areas, such as Henan Province, local and special products account for 55% of the total value of agricultural production, while in Guizhou Province, local and special products are equivalent to about 70% of the total grain output. Experience over the past two years has proven that vigorously opening up sales channels for local and special products is an important step in supporting spring plowing production, helping farmers in disaster areas overcome difficulties, and invigorating the urban and rural economy. All regions that have responsibly and conscientiously solved this problem have achieved good results.

    However, judging from the transaction figures of the urban and rural material exchange meetings in the first quarter, the achievements in promoting the sales of local and special products are not significant. According to available data, the total transaction value of material exchange meetings was over 2.3 trillion yuan, of which local and special products only accounted for about 50%. Of course, there are many reasons for this situation, but the fact that most regions have not yet paid attention to the work of promoting local and special products is an important reason.

    State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should adopt all methods to solve the current problem of overstocked local and special products. State-owned commercial enterprises must first take a responsible and conscientious attitude towards solving the sales problems of overstocked local and special products, especially those in disaster areas. The so-called "responsible and conscientious attitude" does not mean "taking over" all local and special products, but rather, under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, conducting commodity screening, clarifying production and sales conditions, carrying out necessary purchases of some overstocked local and special products, and actively studying the reasons for the overstocking of local and special products, taking necessary measures, and step by step leading various economic components to actively engage in the business of local and special products.

    The following principles should be adopted to solve the problem of overstocked local and special products: For local and special products that already have strong sales or have no sales problems, cooperatives and private merchants should continue to be encouraged to operate them, under the principle of not violating the interests of producers, consumers, and transporters. State-owned commercial enterprises should pay special attention to the overstocked local and special products in disaster areas, and strive to purchase local and special products that are temporarily overstocked but seriously affect the production and life of farmers and handicraftsmen. For certain local and special products that are overstocked due to excessively high prices, prices should be appropriately lowered to open up sales channels. As long as the farmers are given the necessary explanation, clarifying the reason that selling at a reduced price is much more beneficial than stockpiling, the farmers are willing to sell at a reduced price. For local and special products that are overstocked due to poor quality specifications and high costs, producers should be educated to improve quality, specifications, and reduce costs. In short, state-owned commercial enterprises should fully exert their leading role in the market, and through measures such as purchasing and adjusting prices, safeguard the interests of producers and consumers, and make it profitable for transporters to operate and be happy to do so, in order to open up the situation of overstocked local and special products.

    Holding local and special product exchange meetings, especially primary market exchange meetings, is an effective way to open up sales channels for local and special products. All localities should, according to actual conditions, and based on the principles of need and possibility, hold primary and intermediate exchange meetings under leadership, and vigorously organize the exchange of local and special products. In order to solve the sales problems of small local products, the current focus should be on organizing exchange meetings in primary markets, making full use of old temple fairs, mountain fairs, mule and horse fairs, medicinal material fairs, and other forms, and existing larger market towns, to plan primary market exchange meetings in a planned manner. The problem of larger quantities of local and special products that cannot be solved at the primary market exchange meetings can be solved by holding intermediate market exchange meetings. If this still cannot solve the problem, then, depending on the needs and possible conditions, consideration can be given to holding several national-level exchange meetings for large quantities of local and special products to solve this problem.

### 国营商业应该努力打开土特产品的销路

    国营商业应该努力打开土特产品的销路
    目前正是贸易淡季，加以第一季度物资交流工作作得不够，以及其他原因，使得某些土产和特产的销路还没有打开。这对农业生产和救灾工作是十分不利的。根据不完全的资料，普遍滞销的土、特产有土布、土糖、土碱、土烟、桐油、猪鬃、芦席、硫磺、松香、药材等；属于地区性的滞销土产有活猪、粉丝、土纸、生漆、甘蔗、葵花籽、黑瓜籽、黑枣、红枣、小茴香、萝卜干、蒲苞、山蚕茧、草帽、夏布、竹浆以及部分手工艺品。我们必须积极地给这些滞销的土、特产打开销路，以便活跃城乡经济，支援春耕生产和救灾工作。
    我国农村的土、特产品是非常丰富的，它对于广大农民的生产和生活的关系是很大的。在一般地区，土特产品的生产比重约占农业生产总值的百分之三十以上；在某些地区，如河南省，土特产品占农业生产总值的百分之五十五，而贵州省的土特产，约当粮食总产值的百分之七十。两年来的经验证明，大力开辟土特产品的销路，是支持春耕生产、支持灾区农民度过困难、活跃城乡经济的一个重要步骤。凡是负责地认真地解决了这个问题的地区，都收到了良好的效果。
    但从第一季度城乡物资交流会中的成交数字来看，土特产推销的成绩是不大的。据现有的资料统计：物资交流会成交总值为二万三千余亿元，其中土特产品仅占百分之五十左右。当然，造成这种情况的原因很多，但大多数地区还没有重视推销土特产的工作，则是一个重要的原因。
    国营商业和供销合作社应该采用一切方法，解决目前土特产滞销的问题。国营商业首先要对滞销的土特产，特别是灾区滞销的土特产的销路问题，采取负责的认真的态度，加以解决。所谓“负责的认真的态度”，不是指把全部土特产“包下来”，而是在当地党政机关领导下，进行商品排队，摸清产销情况，对有些滞销的土特产进行必要的收购；并积极研究土特产滞销的原因，采取必要的措施，有步骤地带动各种经济成份，促使它们积极经营土特产的业务。
    解决土特产滞销的问题，应该采取下列原则：对目前销路已经很旺、或销路已无问题的土特产，在不违反生产者、消费者、贩运者的利益的原则下，继续鼓励合作社和私商经营；国营商业应特别注意灾区滞销的土特产，努力收购一时滞销而又严重影响农民、手工业者的生产和生活的土特产品。对某些由于价格过高而滞销的土特产品，应适当降低价格，以打开销路。只要对农民进行必要的解释，说明减价销出比较积压起来要有利得多的道理，农民是愿意减价销售的。对于质量规格不好、成本又高而滞销的土特产品，应该教育生产者改进质量、规格和降低成本。总之，国营商业应该充分发挥对市场的领导作用，通过收购和调整价格等措施，以维护生产者、消费者的利益，并使贩运者有利可图，乐于经营，以打开土特产滞销的局面。
    召开土特产交流会，特别是召开初级市场的土特产交流会，是打开土特产销路的有效方法。各地应该根据实际情况，根据需要和可能的原则，有领导地召开初级、中级交流会，大力组织土特产的交流。为了解决小土产的销路问题，目前重点应是组织初级市场的交流会，尽量利用旧有的庙会、山会、骡马大会、药材大会等形式，和固有的较大集镇，有计划地安排初级市场的交流会。在初级市场交流会上所不能解决的较大宗的土特产销路问题，则可召开中级市场的交流会来解决。假如这样还不能解决问题，那末，根据需要与可能的条件，可考虑召开几种带有全国性的大宗的土特产的交流会，解决这个问题。
