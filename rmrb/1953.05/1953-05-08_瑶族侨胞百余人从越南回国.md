Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Recently, one hundred and fifty-four Yao compatriots who returned from the French-occupied areas of Vietnam have settled down and resumed production with the help of the People's Government. Before liberation, they had migrated from Fangcheng, Shangsi, and other counties in Guangxi to live in villages and towns in northern Vietnam. There, they were subjected to increasingly cruel extortion and conscription by the French army and the Bảo Đại puppet army, and risked breaking through various obstacles to return to their motherland. They were left with nothing when they left the French-controlled areas. After returning to China, they were warmly welcomed and consoled by the government and people of all ethnic groups. The Fangcheng County People's Government first issued them food allowances as temporary subsidies before they returned home. After eight households, totaling thirty-three Yao compatriots, returned to Dagou Village in the county, the government immediately helped them settle down and start a business.

    瑶族侨胞百余人从越南回国
    据新华社讯：最近由越南法军占领区回国的一百五十四名瑶族侨胞，在人民政府帮助下已安家生产。他们是在解放以前由广西的防城、上思等县迁到越北一带村镇居住的。在那里，他们因不堪法军、保大伪军日益残酷的搜刮敲榨和抓兵，冒险突破各种阻难回到祖国来。他们离开法军统治区时已一无所有。他们回国后受到政府和各民族人民的热情欢迎和慰问。防城县人民政府首先发给他们伙食费，作为回家前的临时补助。该县大沟村的八户三十三个瑶族侨胞回家后，即由政府帮助安家立业。
