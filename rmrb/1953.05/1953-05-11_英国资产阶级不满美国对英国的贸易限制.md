Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th: Recently, the British bourgeoisie has been increasingly indignant, complaining that the United States, on the one hand, does not allow Britain to engage in favorable trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and on the other hand, is unwilling to relax its own trade restrictions at all, and is adopting increasingly blatant discrimination against Britain.

    The British Information Services, an official British body, issued a lengthy commentary on the 5th, stating that Britain and European countries are now concerned about U.S. foreign economic policy "with considerable unease and disappointment." The commentary complained that Britain had hoped that the Republican government would "move more quickly towards freer trade," and that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Economic Conference had even formulated a set of trade plans "consistent with the American way of economic life" based on this assumption. However, the British Information Services said that the U.S. response so far has been "disappointing." Not only that, but Eisenhower's Republican government "has other disappointing things," including: rejecting the bid of a British company on the Josephs Creek Sluice construction project—although its bid was one million dollars lower than that of an American company; restoring strict restrictions on certain dairy products; and some American industries are making "overwhelming demands for more protection measures."

    The British Information Services then resentfully said: "In view of these American attitudes and policies, Britain may be forced to change the plans it made at the Commonwealth Economic Conference. Britain itself may still have to return to the Commonwealth countries and the Western European countries associated with it." The commentary finally warned the stingy American capitalists: "They should realize that there is a great deal of latent anti-American sentiment in Europe, and the Americans themselves have provided most of the materials and weapons to those who hold such ideas."

    The next day, "The Times," an important mouthpiece of the British bourgeoisie, published an article refuting Senator McCarthy's criticism of Western capitalists who continue to do business with China. The newspaper said: "They do not take into account the fact that trade is beneficial to both sides…." The newspaper pointed out: "McCarthy's policy" will inevitably lead to a complete halt to trade with the democratic camp, which will cause a "large-scale war on the trade front" in the capitalist world.

    Prior to this, "The Economist" magazine, another important mouthpiece of British capitalists, published three articles of varying lengths in its April 25th issue, commenting on U.S. commercial discrimination against Britain. In one article, "The Economist" mentioned the "anger" caused in Britain by the Josephs Creek Sluice incident. It also specifically mentioned Senator Taft's comments on Britain's slogan of "trade, not aid" in demanding fair trade with the United States. Taft said he agreed with the latter half of the slogan.

    In another article, "The Economist" cited the Josephs Creek Sluice incident and the U.S. government's perfunctory attitude towards the delegation sent by the "European Economic Cooperation Administration" to Washington to discuss U.S. foreign economic policy. The magazine pointed out that the United States agreed with the "theoretically desirable" points of the delegation's plan, but emphasized that they would like to see Europe increase its exports to "third-party countries"—that is, countries not including the United States.

    The title of the third article was: "Words, Not Trade." The article pointed out the inconsistency between the U.S. government's words and deeds in a sarcastic tone. The article specifically quoted Eisenhower's speech at a luncheon of the American Newspaper Editors Association: "We don't care about fine words." The article then pointed out: Eisenhower said that the United States should try to increase imports to "help our allies achieve self-sufficiency," but on practical issues such as the Josephs Creek Sluice incident and tariff policy, it supported a "protectionist" stance.

    英国资产阶级不满美国对英国的贸易限制
    【新华社九日讯】伦敦消息：最近以来，英国的资产阶级愈来愈激愤地抱怨美国一方面不许英国和苏联及人民民主国家进行有利的贸易，另一方面又一点也不愿放松自己的贸易限制并且对英国采取愈来愈露骨的歧视。
    英国官方的英国新闻处五日发了一条很长的评论说，英国和欧洲国家现在“带着相当大程度的不安和失望”关心着美国的对外经济政策。评论埋怨诉说，英国曾经希望共和党政府上台会“更快地走向更自由的贸易”，联邦总理经济会议还根据这种假定定出了一套“符合美国经济生活方式”的贸易计划。但是，英国新闻处说，美国的回答迄今是“令人失望的”。不仅如此，艾森豪威尔的共和党政府“还有其他令人失望的事情”，包括：在大约瑟夫水闸建筑工程包工上拒绝英国公司的投标——虽然它的标价比美国公司要低一百万美元；恢复对某些牛乳制品的严格限制；美国的一些行业“排山倒海般要求更多的保护办法”。
    英国新闻处接着愤懑地说：“从这些美国的态度和政策来看，英国可能要被迫改变它在联邦经济会议上所定出的计划。英国自己可能仍然要回到联邦国家和与它有联系的西欧国家去。”评论最后警告一毛不拔的美国资本家说：“他们应该认识到欧洲有很大的潜伏的反美情绪，而美国人自己对抱有这种想法的人提供了大部分材料和武器。”
    第二天，英国资产阶级的重要喉舌“泰晤士报”发表文章，反驳美国参议员麦卡锡对继续和中国做生意的西方资本家的批评。该报说：“他们没有注意到这个事实：贸易对于双方都是有利的……。”该报指出：“麦卡锡政策”必然会使对民主阵营的贸易完全停顿，而这将造成资本主义世界“贸易战线上大规模的战争”。
    在这以前，英国资本家的另一重要喉舌“经济学家”杂志在四月二十五日一期里发表了大小三篇文章，评论美国对英国的商业歧视。在一篇文章里，“经济学家”提到大约瑟夫水闸事件在英国引起的“愤怒”。它还特别提到美国最有势力的参议员塔夫脱对英国要求和美国公平交易的“要贸易，不要援助”的口号的评论。塔夫脱说，他同意这个口号的后半句。
    在另外一篇文章里，“经济学家”举出大约瑟夫水闸事件和美国政府对“欧洲经济合作局”派到华盛顿去讨论美国对外经济政策的代表团的敷衍态度。杂志指出，美国同意了代表团的计划的“理论上可取”之点，但又强调，他们愿意看到欧洲增加对“第三方面国家”——就是说美国不在其内——的出口。
    第三篇文章的标题是：“言语，不是贸易”。文章以讥讽口吻指出美国政府言行不一。文章特地引用了艾森豪威尔在美国报纸编辑协会午餐会上发表的演说中的一句话：“光说漂亮话我们是不在意的。”文章然后指出：艾森豪威尔说过美国应设法增加入口以“帮助我们盟国达到自给自足”，但是在大约瑟夫水闸事件、关税政策等实际问题上，又支持“保护主义”的立场。
