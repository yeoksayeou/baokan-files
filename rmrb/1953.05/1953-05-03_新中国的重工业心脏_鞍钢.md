    Anshan Iron and Steel, the Heavy Industry Heart of New China
    Chang Gong
    I remember when I first arrived at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, it was like stepping into a completely different world. Rows of chimneys, like a forest, stretched towards the sky. The billowing smoke truly blotted out the sun. The tall and large factory buildings seemed to stretch endlessly. The constantly moving trains and the ceaselessly turning machines emitted deafening roars. At night, the boiling steel and iron flowing from the blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces painted half the sky red. Once, I planned to see all the factories and mines here in two or three days, but it took me nearly ten days, sometimes traveling by car or even train, and I still didn't see everything. Many of the company's mines were over a hundred miles away. The factories concentrated in Anshan alone stretched for more than ten miles. Just to take a quick look at these factories took at least a day or two. Here, for three years, tens of thousands of workers have been working intensely, supplying vast amounts of iron and steel to the Huai River harnessing project in East China, the Jingjiang flood diversion project in Central South China, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway construction project in Southwest China, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway construction project in Northwest China, and hundreds of factories across the country that manufacture various machines. It has played a huge role in the initial recovery and development of our national economy.
    With the start of China's first Five-Year Plan for economic construction, the scale of Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction has further expanded. According to the state's plan, by the last year of the Five-Year Plan, Anshan Iron and Steel Company will be three or four times larger than its current size. The large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant that began construction last year, the renovation of Blast Furnace No. 8, and the thin plate plant and Dagushan mine that began construction this year, along with the renovation of Steel Plant No. 1, the primary rolling mill, and Blast Furnace No. 7, are all part of the overall construction plan. Once this part is completed, it will create a more solid material foundation for our country to build various factories and mines, construct railways and bridges, conduct geological exploration, and manufacture trains, automobiles, ships, tractors, and various other industries.
    In order to complete this massive capital construction project, Anshan Iron and Steel Company began large-scale preparations a year ago. This included the deployment, organization, and training of hundreds of key cadres, thousands of technicians, and tens of thousands of workers; the purchase, ordering, and transportation of tens of thousands of tons of steel, machinery, cement, sand, gravel, hardware, and over ten thousand other materials. Twelve departments were established for business operations and political work, including geology, design, planning, technology, materials, equipment, financial management, labor and wages, organization, security, propaganda, and secretarial work. Six engineering companies and dozens of engineering teams specializing in various trades were organized for civil construction, mechanical installation, metal structure, electrical installation, sanitary equipment installation, and furnace construction. In addition, dozens of processing factories were established for concrete, formwork, steel reinforcement, and wood, as well as a supply station including two hundred automobiles and dozens of automated mechanical equipment such as huge excavators, cranes, graders, light-duty universal loaders, and concrete vibrators. Therefore, since construction officially began in April last year, an unprecedented and grand labor scene in China's history has emerged. I remember that during the most intense period, it was difficult to pass through a construction site because six engineering companies and dozens of engineering teams simultaneously occupied every corner – from the high sky, the ground, to the depths of more than ten meters underground.
    In the massive construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, it's not that we didn't encounter difficulties, but that we encountered many difficulties. The most significant difficulties were the massive scale of the project, the complexity of the technology, and the urgency of the time. The people participating in this construction had not only never seen such a construction before, but many had never even heard of it. For example, the large-scale rolling mill project that began construction last year required 90,000 tons of steel, concrete, and wood, which could fill 18,000 large trucks with a capacity of five tons. The concrete required for just one machine base could build a five-story building with an area of 8,000 square meters. A single machine part installed on this base weighed thirty-eight tons, and a single anchor bolt weighed 1.8 tons. The technical requirements were extremely precise and stringent. Not only were tens of thousands of tons of machinery to be installed on specific center lines and elevation points with a distance deviation of no more than a hair's breadth, or even one-eighth of a hair's breadth in some cases, but also the foundation of the factory needed to be determined for more than a year because the soil under each pillar and machine base had to be tested. Nearly four hundred types of soil needed to be tested. All of this was considered relatively simple compared to the design work before the factory was built and the electrical adjustments that would begin later! However, thanks to the selfless labor of the workers, the selfless assistance of our great ally the Soviet Union, and the strong support of the people of the whole country, all difficulties were overcome. For example, Blast Furnace No. 8, which began production on March 9 this year, encountered countless difficulties, but it took only six months from construction to opening the furnace. The annual output of pig iron is even more than the annual output of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. The workers participating in this construction came from all over the country, including workers, farmers, students, women, and demobilized soldiers from the army. From my contact with them, I deeply felt that they all had a common ideal, which was to dedicate everything to the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company for the sake of the country's industrialization. Therefore, they launched a vigorous patriotic labor competition last year, learning, promoting, and creating more than 120 kinds of advanced experiences, many of which increased work efficiency by one to eight times. I am often moved by their selfless labor enthusiasm. On the night of June 19 last year, when the workers were working hard, there was a "crackling" sound from the construction site of the seamless steel tube plant. It turned out that Wang Shoushan, the foreman of the No. 11 pillar pit, had not followed the instructions of the Soviet experts to support a horizontal belt for every meter of soil excavated. Instead, he only supported two horizontal belts at the beginning and then only excavated the soil without supporting the horizontal belts. As a result, when digging to a depth of eight meters, the surrounding soil pressed down, and the two horizontal belts on top couldn't bear it and began to crack. If this pillar pit collapsed, the entire frame would collapse. At this critical moment, Communist Party member Wang Hongfa, Youth League members Meng Qingguo, Yuan Youren, Wang Hongchen, Qin Guoren, and Dong Qifan disregarded their personal safety and jumped down to rescue, finally saving the pillar pit and protecting the construction of the frame. This is just one example of how these workers often regard the construction of the factory as more important than their own lives. Meng Qingguo said to me, "When I think of the volunteers shedding blood on the front lines to defend us, and when I think of how our lives will be happier when this factory is built, I don't care about anything." These words are very simple, but this is exactly the thinking of all the workers building Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
    Our country's heavy industry heart, the base for our country's industrialization, the symbol of our people's journey towards peace and a happy life – Anshan Iron and Steel Company is advancing rapidly like this. Let us take out all our strength and bravely advance to support, build, and defend Anshan Iron and Steel Company!

    新中国的重工业心脏——鞍钢
    常工
    记得我刚到鞍山钢铁公司的时候，就像完全走进了另外一个世界，一排排的烟囱，像树林般地伸向天空，一卷卷的浓烟，真是遮天蔽日，又高又大的厂房，从这头望不到那头，来回滚动着的火车，昼夜转动着的机械，发出震耳的轰鸣，一到夜间，从高炉和平炉里流出来的沸腾的钢液和铁流，把半边天空映得一片通红。有次，我曾经计划在两三天内，把这里所有的工厂和矿山看上一遍，但我化了将近十天的时间，有时还要坐坐汽车，甚至坐坐火车，却仍然没有走遍，因为属于这个公司的许多矿山都在一百里路以外，仅仅集中在鞍山的工厂，也有十多里路长，就把这些工厂，走马观花一样地看上一遍，至少也得一、两天的时间。就在这里，三年来，成千上万的工人进行着紧张的劳动，曾为我国华东地区的根治淮河工程、中南地区的荆江分洪工程、西南地区成渝铁路修筑工程，西北地区天兰铁路的修筑工程，以及全国数百个制造各种机械的工厂，供应了大量的钢铁和钢材，在我国民经济的初步恢复和发展中发挥了巨大作用。
    随着我国第一个五年经济建设计划的开始，鞍钢基本建设的规模进一步扩大了。按照国家的计划，到五年计划的最后一年，鞍山钢铁公司比起现在的规模，还要大上三、四倍。去年开始新建的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂与改建的第八号炼铁炉，以及今年开始新建的薄板厂、大孤山矿山，与改建的第一炼钢厂、初轧厂、第七号炼铁炉等，就是整个建设计划中的一部分，这一部分完成后，就为我国建设各种工厂、矿山，兴修铁路、建筑桥梁、地质钻探以及制造火车、汽车、轮船与拖拉机等各种工业，创造了更雄厚的物质基础。
    为了完成这一规模巨大的基本建设，鞍山钢铁公司在一年以前，就进行巨大规模的准备工作了。其中包括数百名主要干部、数千名技术人员以及数万工人的调配、组织和训练；数以万吨计算的钢材、机械、洋灰、沙石、五金等上万种器材的购买、订制和运输。成立了地质、设计、计划、技术、材料、设备、财务管理、劳动工资、组织、保卫、宣传和秘书等十二个处的业务工作和政治工作的机构；组织了土木建筑、机械安装、金属结构、电气安装、卫生设备安装及筑炉等六个工程公司和数十个不同工种的工程队。此外还建立了混凝土、模板、钢筋、木材等数十个加工工厂，和一个包括二百辆汽车及巨大的挖土机、起重机、铲平机与轻便的万能装卸机、混凝土震动器等数十种自动化机械设备的供应站。因此从去年四月正式开始建设以后，就出现了我国历史上空前未有的伟大的劳动场面。我记得在最紧张的时候，要想从一个工地穿过都是很困难的，因为在每一个工地上，往往都是六个工程公司和数十个工程队，同时占据了每个角落——从高空、地面直到深达十余公尺的地下。
    在鞍山钢铁公司这一规模巨大的建设中，我们不是没有遇到困难，而是曾经遇到了许多困难，其中最主要的困难，就是工程规模浩大，技术复杂，时间紧迫。而参加这一建设的人们，不但从来没有见过这样的建设，甚至许多人从来也没有听说过。比如去年开始建设的大型轧钢厂工程，它所需要的钢材、混凝土、木材等，就达九万吨重，可装一万八千辆载重五吨的大汽车。其中一个安放机器的座子需要的混凝土，就可以建筑一座有八千平方公尺面积的五层大楼，而装在这个座子上面的一个机器零件，就有三十八吨重，一个地脚螺丝的重量也有一点八吨。技术上的要求，又极其精密和极其严格，不仅上万吨的机器要安装在一定的中心线和标高点上，其上下左右的距离不能相差一根头发丝，有的更不能相差一根头发丝的八分之一，而且确定工厂的地基还要一年多的时间，因为每一个柱子和机器座子底下的土都要经过化验，需要化验的土就相近四百种。而所有这些要比起建厂以前的设计工作和以后开始生产的电气调整来，还算比较简单哩！但是由于工人们的忘我劳动，伟大盟邦苏联的无私援助，全国人民的大力支援，一切困难都被我们战胜了。比如今年三月九日开始生产的第八号高炉，虽然曾经遇到无数的困难，但从施工到开炉也不过是六个月的时间。而每年生铁的产量，比北京石景山钢铁厂每年的产量还要多。参加这一建设的工人来自全国各地，有工人，有农民，有学生，有妇女，还有从部队转业的军人。从我和他们的接触中，深深感到他们都有着一个共同的理想，这就是为了祖国走向工业化，他们要把自己的一切都献给鞍山钢铁公司的建设。因此，他们在去年一年中，曾开展了轰轰烈烈的爱国主义劳动竞赛，仅学习、推广和创造的先进经验，就达一百二十多种，其中有许多先进经验，竟使工作效率提高了一倍到八倍。我经常为他们那种忘我的劳动热忱所感动。那是去年六月十九日的夜间，工人们正在紧张工作的时候，忽然无缝钢管厂的工地里，“喀吧喀吧”地响起来。原来是十一号柱坑的领工员王寿山，未按苏联专家的指示，在每挖一公尺土方时，撑上一根横带，而是在一开始时撑了两根横带以后就只挖土方不撑横带了。结果挖到八公尺深时，四周的土就往下压，上面两根横带吃不住，开始裂缝了，这柱坑一塌，整个房架也就要塌下来。在这万分危急的关头，共产党员王洪发，青年团员孟庆国、原有仁、王宏臣、秦国恩和董其范等，就都不顾生命危险，先后跳下去抢救，终于挽救了这个柱坑，保护了房架的建筑，这就是这些工人常常把工厂的建设看的比自己生命还重要的一个例子。孟庆国对我说：“我一想起在前线流血保卫我们的志愿军，一想起这个工厂建设起来，我们生活更加幸福的时候，我什么也不顾了。”这话很简单，但这正是建设鞍山钢铁公司的全体工人的思想。
    我们祖国重工业的心脏，我国走向工业化的基地，我国人民走向和平、幸福生活的象征——鞍山钢铁公司就是这样迅速地前进着，让我们拿出所有的力量，为支援、建设和保卫鞍山钢铁公司而奋勇前进吧！
