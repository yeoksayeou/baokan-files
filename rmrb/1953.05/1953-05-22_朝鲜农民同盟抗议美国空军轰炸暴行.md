Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st. The Central Committee of the Korean Farmers' Alliance issued a statement on the 19th, protesting the crimes of the US aggressors in indiscriminately bombing peaceful towns and villages and irrigation facilities in the rear of Korea, and demanding that the perpetrators of these crimes be severely punished.

The statement said: Just as the Korean armistice negotiations have resumed, and our representatives, with the unanimous support of peace-loving people all over the world, are making sincere efforts to achieve a speedy armistice, these heinous bombing atrocities committed by the enemy are clearly a series of provocative acts aimed at hindering the progress of the armistice negotiations.

The statement pointed out: In the course of the war, it has become clear that every time the enemy commits brutal and bestial bombing crimes, all it gets is more disastrous defeats and further exposes its savage and aggressive nature before the people of the world. The Korean people have an unwavering and strong will to overcome any difficulties and are prepared to crush all the enemy's conspiracies in order to win the freedom and independence of their motherland.

The statement emphasized: All of our farmers are extremely indignant at this brutal crime of US imperialism. We resolutely protest the heinous atrocities of US imperialism together with the people of the world. We believe that the US government must bear full responsibility for this crime.

    朝鲜农民同盟抗议美国空军轰炸暴行
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜农民同盟中央委员会在十九日发表声明，抗议美国侵略者滥炸朝鲜后方和平城乡和灌溉设施的罪行，并要求严惩这种罪行的制造者。
    声明说：正当朝鲜停战谈判恢复，我方代表在全世界爱好和平人民的一致支持下，为迅速实现停战而进行诚挚努力的时候，敌人所制造的这些凶恶的滥炸暴行，显然是企图阻挠停战谈判进展的一连串挑衅行为。
    声明指出：在战争过程中，已经清楚地证明，敌人每次制造残暴的兽性轰炸罪行，它所得到的只是更加惨重的失败和在全世界人民面前进一步暴露它的野蛮的侵略本性。朝鲜人民为了争取祖国的自由独立，有着足以克服任何困难的不可动摇的坚强意志和随时粉碎敌人一切阴谋诡计的准备。
    声明强调说：我们全体农民对美帝国主义这种残暴罪行，感到无比愤怒。我们和全世界人民一道坚决抗议美帝国主义的罪恶暴行。我们认为美国政府必须对这种罪行负完全的责任。
