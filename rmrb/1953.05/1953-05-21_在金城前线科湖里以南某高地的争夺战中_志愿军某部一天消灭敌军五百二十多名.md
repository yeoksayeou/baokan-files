Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th: This reporter reports: On May 17th, on the Jin cheng front, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army annihilated more than 520 enemy troops in the battle for a highland south of Kehuli, west of the North Han River.

On the morning of May 17th, the enemy, with a battalion of troops, launched ten consecutive frenzied counterattacks on the newly occupied hilltop position south of Kehuli. When the enemy began their attack, they released a large amount of smoke to obscure the vision of our artillery. However, our infantry promptly indicated the firing targets to the artillery, so that the enemy still suffered heavy casualties from our artillery fire on their way of attack. On one occasion, a sudden barrage of artillery fire from our army killed and wounded more than 150 enemies; the infantry soldiers saw with their own eyes the enemies running around in panic, some even jumping into the North Han River on the east side in panic. Our artillery shells also followed the enemy and exploded in the river, annihilating the enemy who attempted to escape by swimming.

In subsequent attacks, the enemy once occupied part of our ground fortifications, but were quickly repelled by our counterattacks. The trenches were littered with piles of enemy corpses killed by our artillery fire. On one occasion, the enemy who rushed up used flamethrowers to spray our tunnel entrances, but our brave warriors rushed out of the tunnels and repelled the enemy.

During the battle, Yang Xingbo, the deputy political instructor of our army, and two medics guarded a position and fought fiercely with more than 100 enemies for a full ten hours, killing and wounding more than 30 enemy troops, and also captured two carbines. Their calm and heroic acts of combat quickly spread throughout the unit, inspiring the morale of many soldiers.

On this day, May 17th, our army annihilated more than 520 enemy troops who came to counterattack. Up to this day, our army has annihilated more than 1,300 soldiers of the Lee Syngman's puppet army's 8th Division in the continuous battle for this hilltop. The 10th Regiment of the division has lost its combat effectiveness due to heavy casualties and has been withdrawn from the front line, replaced by the 21st Regiment to participate in the battle. However, this regiment also suffered the same severe blow as soon as it arrived at the position.

On the 18th, the US radio station described the failure of the Lee Syngman's puppet army as a voluntary abandonment of the position. However, the fact is not voluntary abandonment, but being driven down by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Until now, there are still more than 250 enemy corpses left on this hilltop that was counterattacked and occupied by our army.

    在金城前线科湖里以南某高地的争夺战中
    志愿军某部一天消灭敌军五百二十多名
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】本社记者报道：五月十七日金城前线中国人民志愿军某部在北汉江以西科湖里以南某高地的争夺战中，消灭了敌军五百二十多名。
    五月十七日清晨，敌人用一个营的兵力向我军新占领的科湖里以南山头阵地连续进行了十次疯狂反扑。敌人开始进攻时，曾施放了大量烟幕来遮掩我军炮兵的眼睛。但是，我军步兵及时地给炮兵指示了射击的目标，使敌人在进攻的路上仍然遭到我炮火的很大杀伤。有一次，我军炮火的一阵急袭就杀伤了一百五十多名敌人；步兵战士亲眼看见敌人被打得东奔西窜，有的甚至慌张得跳入山东面的北汉江里。我军炮弹也跟着敌人落在江里爆炸，消灭了企图游水逃走的敌人。
    在以后的进攻中，敌人曾一度占领我军一部分地面工事，但很快就被我军反击下去，阵地上摆着被我军炮火杀伤的成堆的敌军尸体。有一次，冲上来的敌人用火焰喷射器向我军坑道口喷射，我军勇士勇猛地冲出坑道，打退了敌人。
    战斗中，我军副政治指导员杨兴波和两个卫生员守住一处阵地，与一百多个敌人激战了整整十个小时，杀伤敌军三十多名，还缴获了两枝卡宾枪。他们这种沉着、英勇的作战事迹，很快在部队中传播开来，鼓舞了许多战士的斗志。
    在十七日这一天中，我军歼灭了前来反扑的敌人五百二十多名。到这一天为止，我军在这一山头的连续争夺战中已歼灭李伪军第八师一千三百多名。该师第十团已因伤亡过重失去战斗力而被撤下前线，另换上了第二十一团参加作战。但是，这个团一上阵地也遭到了同样严重的打击。
    十八日，美国广播电台曾把李伪军的失败说成是自动放弃阵地。但是，事实不是自动放弃，而是被中国人民志愿军赶下去的。直到现在，还有二百五十多个敌军尸体留在这个被我军反击占领的山头上。
