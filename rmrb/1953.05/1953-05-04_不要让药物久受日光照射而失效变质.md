Reader's Letters Summary:

    Do not let drugs be exposed to sunlight for long periods, causing them to lose efficacy and deteriorate
    Reader Chen Shiyao writes: Some pharmacies display medicines in glass cabinets, allowing them to be exposed to sunlight; this is a very dangerous thing. Because every medicine has its specific properties and functions, some medicines will undergo chemical changes such as oxidation or reduction after being exposed to ultraviolet rays; this will not only reduce or eliminate its efficacy, but may also turn it into a toxic substance. Therefore, I suggest that drugs that are easily changed by light must be packaged in blue or brown glass bottles, pharmacies should avoid light for these types of drugs as much as possible, and drugs that have lost efficacy and deteriorated due to sunlight exposure should no longer be sold.

### 不要让药物久受日光照射而失效变质

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不要让药物久受日光照射而失效变质
    读者陈仕尧来信：有一些药房把药品摆在玻璃柜里展览，任凭阳光照射；这是一件很危险的事情。因为每一种药物都具有它一定的性质和功能，有些药物经过紫外线的照射，就会起氧化或还原等化学变化；这不仅仅会减低或消失它的功效，而且很可能变成有毒的东西。因此，我建议：凡受光易起变化的药物一定要装在蓝色或棕色的玻璃瓶内，药房应尽可能让这类药避光，凡已经因阳光照射而失效变质的药物则不应该再行出售。
