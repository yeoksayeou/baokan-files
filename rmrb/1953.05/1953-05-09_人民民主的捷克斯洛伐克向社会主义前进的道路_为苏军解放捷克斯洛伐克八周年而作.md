    The Road of People's Democratic Czechoslovakia Towards Socialism
    -- Written for the Eighth Anniversary of the Soviet Army's Liberation of Czechoslovakia
    By: Indrich Uher, Deputy Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic
    May 9th marks the greatest festival of our nation and country for the working people of Czechoslovakia. Eight years have passed since the glorious Soviet army liberated our capital, Prague, from the clutches of Hitler, and defeated fascist Hitlerite Germany. Our entire people celebrate this significant day with sincere gratitude towards the Soviet Union, the heroic Soviet army, and our great friend, Marshal Stalin. In these days when the grief arising from the untimely passing of our Republic's President, Comrade Klement Gottwald, has not yet dissipated, the working people of our cities and countryside remember with gratitude and love their great friend and mentor, the late Comrade Stalin. By his order, the Soviet army delivered a swift and deadly blow to the Hitlerite bandits, bringing freedom to our capital and our homeland.
    The day of May 9, 1945, meant for our people the restoration and complete consolidation of our national autonomy and state independence; it meant the victory of the revolutionary working class and the masses of the people in their years-long struggle for social liberation; it meant the establishment and consolidation of the alliance of our two nations on the basis of the principle of national self-determination.
    The glorious day of May 9, 1945, was the beginning of the establishment of the people's power in Czechoslovakia and the end of the rule of the exploiting classes. This day was a major victory for our working class, which, under the leadership of the Communist Party, led the laboring masses in an irreconcilable class struggle against capitalist persecution, against capitalists, landlords, and their political representatives – the bourgeoisie and reformist parties. On May 9, 1945, a new, advanced democratic system was born in Czechoslovakia: people's democracy.
    The Czechoslovak laboring people, tempered by the beloved Communist Party and the late, beloved leader Klement Gottwald, began to build the foundations of people's democracy by strengthening socialist construction in an unbreakable and close national unity. Despite the deliberate resistance of the right-wing elements in the National Front, led by former President Benes, in the initial period of restored independence before the February Revolution, the working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, nationalized factories, banks, railways, and other key positions in the national economy. Capitalists, factory owners, bankers, and landlords were deprived of their economic rights. In agriculture, a historically significant land reform was also implemented. Land formerly used to exploit small and middle peasants was transferred to the hands of those who actually worked the land. The alliance of the working class and the peasants was thus consolidated.
    Thanks to the Soviet Union's selfless and fraternal assistance in all aspects, our young people's democratic republic was able to carry out innovative construction and develop towards socialism, and was able to successfully overcome the war and all the new difficulties caused by the severe crop failure in 1947.
    The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the leading force of the Czech and Slovak National Front, has continuously warned the working people of our cities and countryside to pay attention to the danger posed to our country by imperialist elements and their lackeys. The leadership of our Party and Comrade Gottwald himself called upon our people to heighten their vigilance, expose the agents and lackeys of imperialism, expose the traitors of the people, and render them harmless. Our Party knew that in the event of the victory of our people, the vicious imperialist elements would not cease to harm Czechoslovakia's socialist construction in various ways, and therefore our Party mobilized the laboring people to participate in the struggle against reactionary forces. Only by carrying out an irreconcilable struggle against these forces can we defend the achievements of our May Revolution, and only in the struggle against the reactionaries can we consolidate and expand the power of the working class. Before 1948, there were many such examples in the development of our economy, illustrating how the capitalist elements who had been deprived of power harmed our republic's socialist construction through acts of sabotage, and exploited the difficulties caused at that time, especially by the drought of 1947. They took advantage of some opportune moments to attempt a counter-revolutionary coup, aiming to restore the capitalist system. Their purpose was to make our country dependent on world capitalism and to undermine our close unity with the Soviet Union. It is an undeniable fact that the anti-Czechoslovakia counter-revolutionary conspiracy was an integral part of the overall plan for world domination formulated by Anglo-American imperialism as early as World War II. According to this plan, the traitorous Czechoslovak bourgeoisie counted on its pillar - the masters of Wall Street, and openly began preparing for a counter-revolutionary conspiracy in February 1948. However, the working class, together with all the working people of our homeland, shattered the world reactionaries' plan to consolidate their position in Central Europe.
    The Czechs and Slovaks, united in the National Front led by the Communist Party and its chairman Comrade Klement Gottwald, shattered the bloody plans of the reactionaries in a united action in February 1948.
    The counter-revolutionary forces suffered bankruptcy in 1948 due to the decisive victory of the Czechoslovak working class and all the working people. Comrade Gottwald, whom we will forever cherish, was the inspirer of this victory. This victory was a great triumph for our Party, which constantly applies the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, learning from the immortal leaders of the world proletariat, Lenin and Stalin, about how to overthrow capitalist enslavement, how to consolidate and expand the power of the working class, and how to bravely advance towards the construction of socialism.
    Under the leadership of our Party and the government of the Czechoslovak Republic, while continuously restricting and suppressing capitalist elements, and following Stalin's methods of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization and mechanization, we have focused all our activities on establishing a socialist social system. In transforming the countryside, the fighting alliance of the working class and the laboring peasants has been vigilantly defended and consolidated.
    Due to the transformation of our industrial production and the elimination of dependence on capitalist countries, and due to the vigorous development of socialist competition among the broad masses of the laboring people, we have achieved remarkable success in the cause of building a socialist industry. During the four years of the Gottwald Five-Year Plan, the material and technical foundation of our socialist construction – heavy industry – has become stronger. Our factories produce more and more means of production necessary for the development of industry every year. These industrial sectors enable our country to more broadly develop economic cooperation with the countries of the socialist camp. Industrial construction and production develop in a planned manner year after year, enabling us to expand and satisfy the needs of society in accordance with the basic economic law of socialism as expressed by the genius Stalin.
    Some figures on socialist construction convincingly prove the great achievements we have made in construction. In 1952, the total industrial output increased by 18.3 percent compared to 1951. In the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 1952, the output of unprocessed iron increased by 21 percent, unprocessed steel increased by 18 percent, lignite increased by 3 percent, coking coal increased by 6 percent, electricity increased by 6 percent, cement increased by 11 percent, wheat flour increased by 9 percent, bread increased by 25 percent, and so on.
    Our country has achieved these achievements because the people's democratic system has aroused the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the working class, organized this force, and guided them to build a happy social system.
    In Czechoslovakia, socialist competition has gained wide scale. The laboring people of cities and countryside, factories and mines, construction and transportation, fields and other socialist construction sectors, launched socialist competition to celebrate the international festival of the working people of the world -- May 1st and the anniversary of the liberation of our homeland by the Soviet army, using their strength to fulfill the legacy of our beloved Comrade Gottwald -- to accelerate the construction of socialism in our country, to enhance our country with new material and cultural wealth, and to comprehensively consolidate the strength and defense forces of our motherland, so that Czechoslovakia becomes a strong pillar of the powerful democratic and socialist camp headed by the mighty Soviet Union and standing shoulder to shoulder with the People's China of Mao Zedong.
    New socialist figures are growing every day in our nationalized industry, transportation, and agriculture. They learn from Soviet technicians and production innovators, and emulate their example, striving to increase labor productivity. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia constantly awakens all the laboring people, making them aware that without the continuous rise of labor productivity, the victory of socialism over capitalism is inconceivable. Strengthening mass political work in this area has been fruitful. In the first quarter of this year, industrial labor productivity increased by 8.8 percent compared to the first quarter of 1952.
    Our people feel heartfelt joy for their achievements. However, they also see their many shortcomings and strive to eliminate these shortcomings, overcome the difficulties that arise during the completion of the plan period, and strive to improve the organization and management of socialist production.
    Our entire Party and government pay great attention to and care for our agriculture, so that agricultural production does not lag behind the rapid development of our socialist industrialization. The main task of Czechoslovak agriculture is to catch up with industrial production and keep pace with it. The political and organizational work carried out by Communist Party members and members of various organizations participating in the National Front is aimed at establishing and consolidating unified agricultural production cooperatives, mobilizing all the creativity in our countryside, striving to increase yields and achieve high livestock productivity. We have already achieved initial results in this area. The strength of socialist construction also guides other farmers and the entire countryside. In 1952, in particular, we took a big step forward. At the beginning of 1952, small and medium farmers had already been united in nearly three thousand advanced-type unified agricultural production cooperatives. By the end of 1952, the number of cooperatives had increased to five thousand seven hundred and eighty-four. In the first quarter of this year, the number of advanced-type unified agricultural production cooperatives has increased to six thousand eight hundred. This means that the number of advanced-type unified agricultural production cooperatives has more than doubled in the period of one year and one season, the foundation of cooperative members has been expanded and consolidated, and many cooperatives have transitioned to a higher type, transitioning to the advanced stage of collective farms.
    At the end of 1952, the socialist part of agriculture had occupied 38 percent of the total agricultural land area of Czechoslovakia. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government give great assistance to the work of consolidating the unified agricultural production cooperatives politically, organizationally and economically. Therefore, the unified agricultural production cooperatives, together with the state-owned economy, have become a decisive factor in increasing field yields and increasing livestock breeding rates. In addition, while paying attention to and caring for the cooperative movement, our party organizations and state power organs also do not neglect the small and medium farmers who are still operating independently today, and give them comprehensive assistance so that they understand the significance of collective management.
    The fraternal Soviet Union helps us to raise agriculture from scattered individual small-scale production to the level of modern socialist large-scale production. The Soviet Union supplies us with highly productive modern machines, mineral fertilizers, excellent varieties, and selflessly tells us about the reliable agricultural technical experience of Soviet agricultural scientists, Soviet state farms, and outstanding workers of collective farms.
    The experience gained in the period of reforming our agriculture confirms the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist scientific principle that class struggle does not weaken but on the contrary intensifies during the period of building socialism. Comrade Gottwald, a loyal student of Lenin and Stalin, instructed us to raise revolutionary vigilance during the current period of intensifying class struggle, when we are implementing restrictions and suppression of rich peasants in the countryside. Some directives of our Party and government aimed at restricting the rich peasants in the countryside and striving to expand and consolidate the alliance of the working class and the middle and small peasants under the leadership of the working class play an important role: that is, to thoroughly eliminate any conciliationism towards the rich peasants, to resolutely eliminate destructive activities in the countryside in the bud within the scope permitted by the laws of our people's democratic country, and to isolate the rich peasants politically from the masses of middle and small peasants through continuous persuasion. Strengthening the Party's work in the countryside, consolidating the Party organizations in the countryside, expanding their ties with the masses of the rural people, and improving mass political work among the peasants are the guarantees for completing this directive of our Party and government, further improving agriculture in Czechoslovakia, and successfully moving towards the socialist road.
    The National Congress of our Party held last December put forward the task to all party members to fight for improving the Party's organizational work in the spirit of the new Party Constitution; in this way, good prerequisites will be established for the socialist construction tasks in all aspects of our economic, state and cultural life.
    Significant achievements have also been made in the domestic commercial sector. In 1948, 88 percent of small businesses were in the hands of private merchants, but currently, 99 percent of small businesses are controlled by state and cooperative retail trade networks. The nationalization of domestic and foreign trade is a decisive step towards a new path. Our socialist foreign trade has consolidated our alliance with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries. In 1949, the trade share of the aforementioned countries in our total foreign trade was still less than half. But in 1951, this share had increased to two-thirds of the total, and is currently approaching three-quarters. The share of imports from the People's Republic of China is increasing smoothly: 5.3 percent in 1952, and 6.2 percent in 1953. The situation is the same if we compare the percentage of our exports to the People's Republic of China in our total exports. For example, exports to China accounted for 5.4 percent in 1952, and increased to 6.3 percent in 1953. As early as 1952, the People's Republic of China had already ranked fourth among the countries importing to Czechoslovakia (after the Soviet Union, Poland, and Hungary), while it ranked fifth among the countries exporting from Czechoslovakia (after the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic).
    It can be seen from the above comparison that Czechoslovakia's foreign trade has great prospects with the development of economic cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia. This cooperation not only gives our foreign trade and our entire national economy the possibility of great development, but also helps the People's Republic of China to achieve the great task of industrialization.
    The People's Republic of China is supplying our industry with certain raw materials, such as iron ore, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, asbestos, soybeans, peanut oil, rice, tea, etc. And we supply China with various industrial products, machinery and equipment for industrial and power plants, rolled metal materials, automobiles, medicines, telephone and telegraph equipment, ball bearings, locomotives and other items.
    Our country is expanding its economic relations with countries that implement planned economies. However, we are not prepared to reduce and restrict our relations with other countries. On the contrary, our government is striving to further develop commercial relations with countries that are willing to cooperate with us honestly and peacefully on an equal footing.
    The upsurge of our economy and the increase in production are the basis for improving the living conditions of the laboring people. In people's democratic Czechoslovakia there is no hunger and unemployment, no one lacks housing, and no one is threatened by poverty and starvation. Because the Soviet Union brought us liberation, what our predecessors dreamed of, and what our best sons and daughters sacrificed their lives for in the capitalist society prisons and Hitler's guillotine -- freedom, the right to work, the right to education and rest, the right to medical assistance, etc. -- have now become a pleasant reality in Czechoslovakia.
    Some figures can best prove the improvement of the welfare of the Czechoslovak people. Last year, bread consumption increased by 10 percent, pasta products increased by 23 percent, lard increased by 9 percent, and meat consumption has been increasing year by year, increasing by 27.5 percent last year compared to 1937….
    With the growth of the material needs of our laboring people, cultural undertakings are also developing. The number of schools has far exceeded the pre-Munich figures. The increase in the number of institutions of higher learning is particularly significant. We now have 30 institutions of higher learning with more than 46,000 students, more than 6,000 of whom are from workers' preparatory classes. In comparison, during the rule of our bourgeois government in Czechoslovakia in 1937-1938, Czechoslovakia had only nine institutions of higher learning and 18,000 college students. The National Front government of Czechs and Slovaks cares very much for children, and it is constantly increasing the number of nurseries and kindergartens. The development of cultural organizations can also be seen from the following fact: there are currently 63 permanent theaters in our country, but in 1937, under the bourgeois government, there were only 17 theaters struggling to survive.
    Our country's strong economic growth and regular development have made the Czechoslovak people deeply understand the fact that while driving out the odious and bloody occupiers from our beautiful land, we can also get rid of the rule of capitalists, and can open up a new period in the history of our nation and country in our free country; the working class leads all laborers and establishes a brotherly alliance with the laboring peasants, and for the first time in our history firmly grasps the power in its own hands; we should thank the Soviet Union, the Soviet army, and the immortal Stalin for all this.
    The Czechoslovak people have written on the emblem of their emerging country the eternal friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union - which is the guarantee of our independence and socialist future. The policy of maintaining close and faithful friendship and cooperation with the country of Lenin and Stalin, as instructed by Gottwald, will also guarantee our country's future independence, security and peace. The idea of stable and peaceful cooperation between countries has penetrated deeply into the thoughts and undertakings of our people. The broad masses of people in cities and villages actively participate in the peace movement. The initiative of the representatives of the People's Republic of China on resuming the Korean armistice negotiations and resolving the POW issue, which is still in dispute, has received a wide response and enthusiastic support in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak people recognize that this is a fair proposal for reaching an agreement and ending the Korean War. The peaceful resolution of the Korean issue will mean the consolidation of peace and security not only for the people of all countries in the Far East, but also for the people of the world.
    For peaceful labor, our people must have peace, which is generated by the peaceful coexistence and competition of two social systems on the principles of equality and cooperation. Our laboring people are determined to strengthen the close and friendly alliance with all democratic and peace-loving nations in the world, and to fight together with them for progress and against the threat of world war. What our laboring people are doing in socialist construction and in fulfilling the tasks of the decisive year of the Gottwald Five-Year Plan proves this. These undertakings are making our country a stronger and more powerful component of the invincible peace camp headed by the mighty Soviet Union and standing shoulder to shoulder with the heroic People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the President of the Republic, Comrade Zapotocky, the Czechoslovak laboring people, led by the working class, advance towards socialism under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, faithful to the cause of Gottwald!

    人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克向社会主义前进的道路
    ——为苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克八周年而作
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国副总理  英德里赫·乌吉尔
    五月九日，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民庆祝自己民族和国家的最伟大的节日。自光荣的苏联军队从希特勒魔爪中解放我国首都布拉格，并战胜了法西斯希特勒德国那天起，已过去八年了。我国全体人民怀着对苏联、对英勇的苏联军队和我们伟大的朋友斯大林大元帅的真挚感谢的心情，来庆祝这个意义重大的日子。在我们共和国总统克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志不适时的逝世而产生的悲痛还没有消失的日子里，我国城市和农村的劳动人民带着感激和热爱来怀念自己的伟大朋友和导师、已故的斯大林同志。按照他的命令，苏军以迅雷不及掩耳的行动给予希特勒匪帮以致命的打击，并给我国首都和我们的祖国带来了自由。
    一九四五年五月九日这一天，对我国人民来说，就是意味着我们民族自主和国家独立的恢复和完全巩固，就是意味着革命的工人阶级和人民群众争取社会解放的多年战斗的胜利，就是意味着我国两个民族在民族自决原则基础之上的联盟的建立和巩固。
    一九四五年五月九日这个光荣的日子，是捷克斯洛伐克人民政权建立的开始，是剥削阶级统治的结束。这一天是我们工人阶级的重大胜利。我国工人阶级领导劳动群众进行了反对资本主义迫害，反对资本家、大地主和他们政治上的代表——资产阶级和改良主义政党的不调和的阶级斗争。一九四五年五月九日，在捷克斯洛伐克诞生了新的、先进的民主制度，即人民的民主制度。
    为亲爱的共产党和故去的、为人民所爱戴的领袖克利门特·哥特瓦尔德所锻炼出来的捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民，在牢不可破的亲密的民族团结中，以加强社会主义建设的方法开始建设人民民主制度的基础。尽管在二月革命以前的恢复独立的最初期间，有以前任总统贝奈斯为首的民族阵线中的右翼分子的故意反抗，工人阶级在共产党的领导下，还是把工厂、银行、铁路和国民经济其他主要阵地收为国有。资本家、工厂主、银行家和大地主被剥夺了经济权利。在农业中，也实行了具有历史意义的土地改革。从前用于剥削小农和中农的土地，转到了真正在这些土地上工作的人们的手中。工人阶级和农民的联盟就这样被巩固起来了。
    由于苏联大公无私地给了我们各方面的兄弟般的帮助，我们年青的人民民主共和国才能进行革新的建设并向社会主义发展，才能够顺利地克服战争以及因一九四七年严重的歉收所引起的一切新困难。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党、捷克和斯洛伐克的民族阵线的领导力量，曾不断警告我们城乡劳动人民，注意帝国主义分子及其奴仆们威胁着我国的那种危险。我党的领导和哥特瓦尔德同志本人号召我国人民要提高警惕，揭露帝国主义的代理人和奴仆，揭露人民的叛徒，使他们无能为害。我党知道，在我国人民胜利的情况之下，凶恶的帝国主义分子是不会停止用各种方法来危害捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设的，因此我党动员劳动人民参加了反对反动势力的斗争。只有和这些势力进行不调和的斗争，才能保卫住我们五月革命的成果，只有在反对反动派的斗争中才能巩固和扩大工人阶级的政权。一九四八年以前，我们经济的发展中就有许多这样的例子，它们说明被剥夺了政权的资本主义分子怎样以怠工行为危害我们共和国的社会主义建设，并利用了当时特别是因一九四七年的旱灾所造成的困难。他们利用一些适当的机会，企图进行反革命的政变，以达到复辟资本主义制度的目的。他们的目的就是使我国依赖世界资本主义而破坏我们与苏联的亲密团结。反对捷克斯洛伐克的反革命的阴谋计划，是英美帝国主义早在第二次世界大战期间就已制定的独霸世界总计划的组成部分，这已是不可辩驳的事实了。根据这个计划，叛变的捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级指望着自己的支柱——华尔街的主人，并在一九四八年二月公开地开始准备反革命的阴谋。但是，工人阶级和我们祖国全体劳动人民一道粉碎了世界反动派企图巩固自己在欧洲中部地位的计划。
    团结在共产党及其主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志所领导下的民族阵线中的捷克和斯洛伐克人，于一九四八年二月以团结一致的行动粉碎了反动分子的血腥计划。
    由于捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和全体劳动人民的决定性的胜利而使反革命势力在一九四八年遭到破产。我们所永远怀念的哥特瓦尔德同志，就是这个胜利的鼓舞者。这一胜利，是我党的伟大凯旋，我党不断地运用着苏联共产党的丰富经验，学习全世界无产阶级不朽的领袖列宁和斯大林关于如何推翻资本主义奴役，如何巩固与扩大工人阶级政权以及勇敢地向建设社会主义前进的指示。
    在不断地限制和镇压资本主义分子的情况下，我党的领导和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府，以斯大林的国家工业化的方法，以农业合作化和机械化的方法把自己的全部活动放在建立社会主义社会制度上。在改造农村的时候，工人阶级和劳动农民的战斗联盟被警惕地保卫着和巩固着。
    由于我国工业生产的改造和摆脱了对资本主义国家的依赖，由于社会主义竞赛在广大的劳动群众中强有力的展开，我们在建设社会主义工业的事业中获得了显著的成就。在哥特瓦尔德五年计划的四年期间，我国的社会主义建设的物质技术基础——重工业变得更加强大了。我国工厂每年都生产出愈来愈多的为发展工业所必需的生产工具。这些工业部门使我国能够更广泛地发展与社会主义阵营各国的经济合作。工业建设和生产有计划地年年发展着，使我们能够根据天才的斯大林所表述的社会主义基本经济法则来扩大和满足社会的需要。
    关于社会主义建设的一些数字，使人信服地证明了我们建设中的伟大成就。一九五二年工业总产量比一九五一年增加了百分之十八·三。今年的第一季度与一九五二年第一季相比，未加工的铁的产量增加百分之二十一，未加工的钢增加百分之十八，褐煤增加百分之三，焦煤增加百分之六，电力增加百分之六，水泥增加百分之十一，小麦粉增加百分之九，面包增加百分之二十五等等。
    我国之所以获得这些成就，是因为人民民主制度唤起了工人阶级的热情、主动性和创造力，组织了这种力量并引导他们来建设幸福的社会制度。
    在捷克斯洛伐克，社会主义竞赛获得了广大的规模。城乡劳动人民、工厂和矿山、建筑和运输，田地上和其他社会主义建设部门的劳动人民，为了庆祝全世界劳动人民的国际节日——五月一日和苏联军队解放我们祖国的日子，展开了社会主义竞赛，他们把自己的力量用来实现亲爱的哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训——加速建设我国的社会主义，以新的物质的和文化的财富来增强我们的国家，全面巩固自己祖国的力量和国防力量，以使捷克斯洛伐克成为以强大的苏联为首的、有毛泽东的人民中国与其并肩而立的强大的民主和社会主义阵营的牢固的支柱。
    在我们收归国有的工业、运输业和农业中，每天都在成长着新的社会主义的人物。他们向苏联的技师和生产革新者学习，并仿效着他们的榜样，为争取提高劳动生产率而斗争。捷克斯洛伐克共产党不断地唤起所有的劳动人民，使他们知道：如果没有劳动生产率的不断高涨，社会主义对资本主义的胜利是不可思议的。在这方面的群众政治工作的加强是有成果的。今年第一季度的工业劳动生产率，比一九五二年第一季度提高了百分之八·八。
    我国人民因自己的成就而感到衷心的欢乐。但是，他们也看到自己的许多缺点，并努力消灭这些缺点，和克服在完成计划时期中所出现的困难，竭力改进社会主义生产的组织和管理。
    我们全党和政府都很注意和关怀我们的农业，以便使农业生产不落后于我国社会主义工业化的迅速发展。捷克斯洛伐克农业的主要任务是赶上工业生产，并和它看齐。共产党员、参加民族阵线的各种组织的成员所进行的政治工作和组织工作，便是以建立和巩固统一农业生产合作社、动员我们农村中的一切创造力、争取提高收获量和达到牲畜的高度生产率为目标的。我们已在这方面获得了初步成绩。社会主义建设的力量也引导着其他农民和整个的农村。特别是在一九五二年，我们曾向前迈进了一大步。还在一九五二年初，中、小农户便已被团结在近三千个高级型式的统一农业生产合作社中。到一九五二年底，合作社的数字已增到五千七百八十四个。今年第一季度，高级型式的统一农业生产合作社已增至六千八百个。这就是说，高级型式的统一农业生产合作社在一年又一季的时期中，已增加了一倍多，合作社社员的基础已经扩大和巩固，很多合作社已过渡到更高级的型式，过渡到集体农庄的高级阶段。
    一九五二年底，农业中的社会主义部分所占土地已占捷克斯洛伐克全部农业用地面积的百分之三十八。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府对于从政治、组织和经济方面来巩固统一农业生产合作社的工作，给以巨大的帮助。因此，统一农业生产合作社和国营经济一起，已成为提高田间收获量和增加牲畜生殖率的决定因素。此外，我们的党组织和国家政权机关一方面注意和关怀合作社运动，同时也不忽略直到今天仍在独立经营的小农和中农，并给他们以全面的帮助，使他们懂得集体经营的意义。
    兄弟般的苏联帮助我们把农业由分散的个体的小生产提高到现代社会主义大规模生产的水平。苏联供给我们以具有高度生产率的现代化机器、矿物肥料、优良品种，同时并大公无私地把苏联农业科学工作者、苏联国营农场和集体农庄的优秀工作者的可靠的农业技术经验告诉我们。
    在改建我国农业的时期中所获得的经验，证实了马克思列宁主义关于在建设社会主义时期中，阶级斗争不是削弱而是相反地更趋尖锐化这一科学原理的正确。列宁和斯大林的忠实学生哥特瓦尔德同志指示我们，在目前阶级斗争尖锐化的时期中，当我们在农村中实行限制和镇压富农的时候，应当提高革命的警惕性。我们的党和政府以限制农村中的富农、努力扩大和巩固工人阶级领导下的工人阶级和中、小农的联盟为目的的一些指令，具有一个重要作用：就是彻底消灭任何对富农的调和主义，在我们人民民主国家的法律所容许的范围内，坚决地把农村中的破坏活动在萌芽中即予以消灭，用不断进行说服的方法，使富农在政治上从中、小农群众中孤立出来。加强农村党的工作，巩固农村党组织，扩大它们和农村人民群众的联系，改进在农民中的群众政治工作，这就是完成我们党和政府的这一指令，进一步提高捷克斯洛伐克的农业、顺利地向社会主义道路迈进的保证。
    去年十二月举行的我们党的全国代表会议向全体党员提出了按照新党章的精神，为改进党的组织工作而斗争的任务；这样，就会为我们的经济、国家和文化生活各方面的社会主义建设任务建立良好的先决条件。
    在国内商业部门中也获得了重大成绩。一九四八年，百分之八十八的小商业是在私商手中，但目前，百分之九十九的小商业已由国家和合作社的零售贸易网所掌握。国内贸易和国外贸易的国有化，是走向新道路的一个决定性步骤。我们的社会主义的国外贸易，巩固了我们同苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的联盟。在一九四九年我们对外贸易的总额中，上述国家所占的贸易份额还不到一半。但是在一九五一年，这一份额已增达总额的三分之二，目前已接近四分之三。从中华人民共和国入口的份额在一帆风顺地提高着：一九五二年百分之五点三，一九五三年已增加为百分之六点二。如果比较我们对中华人民共和国的输出额在我国总输出额中的百分比，情形也是一样。例如，一九五二年对中国的输出占百分之五点四，而到一九五三年已增加为百分之六点三。早在一九五二年，在对捷克斯洛伐克的输入国中，中华人民共和国已占了第四位（仅次于苏联、波兰和匈牙利），而在捷克斯洛伐克的输出国中它所占的则是第五位（次于苏联、波兰、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国）。
    从上述的比较中可以看出，捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易随着捷中两国经济合作的发展，具有伟大的远景。这种合作不仅给我们的对外贸易和我们全部国民经济以巨大发展的可能，此外，还给了它以帮助中华人民共和国实现工业化的伟大任务。
    中华人民共和国正在供给我们的工业以某些原料，如铁矿、有色金属、稀有金属、石绵、黄豆、花生油、大米、茶叶等。而我们则向中国供应各种工业制成品、工业和动力工厂的机器设备、压延金属材料、汽车、药品、电话和无线电报设备、球轴承、机车和其他物品。
    我国正在扩大自己和实行计划经济各国之间的经济关系。但是，我们并不准备减少和限制自己同其余国家的关系。恰正相反，我国政府正在努力进一步发展与那些愿意和我们以平等地位诚实而和平地合作的国家的商业关系。
    我国经济的高涨和生产的提高是改善劳动人民生活条件的基础。在人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克没有饥饿和失业现象，没有缺乏房子住的人，任何人都不会受到贫困和饥饿的威胁。由于苏联给我们带来了解放，那些为前辈人所梦想、在资本主义社会监狱和希特勒断头台上，我国最优秀的儿女们曾为之献出自己生命的东西——自由、工作权、教育和休息权、医药帮助权等，现在在捷克斯洛伐克已成为愉快的现实了。
    一些数字可以作为捷克斯洛伐克人民福利提高的最好证明。去年，面包的消费量增加了百分之十，面制品增加了百分之二十三，猪油增加了百分之九，肉类的消费量在逐年增加，去年比一九三七年提高了百分之二十七点五……。
    随着我国劳动人民物质需要的增长，文化事业也在发展着。学校的数目已远远地超过了慕尼黑前的数字。高等学校数目的增加尤其显著，现在我们已有三十个高等学校，学生在四万六千人以上，其中有六千多人是来自工人预备班的。与此相比，在一九三七——一九三八年我国资产阶级政府统治时期，捷克斯洛伐克仅有九所高等学校和一万八千名大学生。捷克人和斯洛伐克人的民族阵线政府非常关怀儿童，它不断地增设着托儿所和幼儿园。文化组织的发展也可由下列事实看出，目前我国有六十三个常设剧院，但在一九三七年资产阶级政府时代却只有十七个在风雨飘摇中度日的剧院。
    我国经济强有力增长和有规律发展，已使捷克斯洛伐克人民深深地懂得这个事实：我们的自由人民在从我们美丽的国土上赶走可憎的血腥的占领者的同时，我们也能摆脱资本家的统治，能够在自己的自由的国家中开辟自己民族和国家历史的新时期；工人阶级领导全体劳动者并同劳动农民建立兄弟联盟，在我国历史上首次牢固地把政权掌握在自己手里；对于这一切，我们应该感谢苏联、感谢苏联的军队和不朽的斯大林。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在他们的新兴的国家的国徽上写下了同苏联的永恒的友谊和联盟——这是我们的独立和社会主义前途的保证。哥特瓦尔德所指示的同列宁和斯大林的国家保持亲密忠实的友谊和合作的政策，亦将保证我国今后的独立、安全与和平。各国间稳定而和平地合作的思想，已深入我国人民的思想和事业中。广大城市和乡村的人民群众积极地参加了和平运动。中华人民共和国代表关于恢复朝鲜停战谈判、解决迄今仍在争执中的遣俘问题的倡议，已在捷克斯洛伐克获得了广泛的响应和热烈的支持。捷克斯洛伐克人民认识到这是达成协议和结束朝鲜战争的一个公正的建议。朝鲜问题的和平解决将不仅意味着远东各国人民，而且也意味着全世界人民的和平与安全的巩固。
    为了宁静的劳动，我国人民必须有和平，这种和平是由两种社会制度可以在平等与合作的原则上和平共处和竞赛而产生的。我国劳动人民决心加强与世界上一切民主和爱好和平的各民族的亲密友好的联盟，并和他们一起为争取进步和反对世界战争的威胁而斗争。我国劳动人民在社会主义建设，在执行哥特瓦尔德五年计划的决定性一年的任务中所做的事业，就证明了这一点。这些事业是使我国成为以强大的苏联为首、并肩站有英勇的中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的无坚不克的和平阵营中的更强大而有力的组成部分。
    以工人阶级为首的捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民，在共产党和共和国总统萨波托斯基同志的领导之下，在列宁和斯大林的旗帜下，忠实于哥特瓦尔德的事业向社会主义迈进！
