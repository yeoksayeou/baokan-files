He thanked the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for its assistance and support to the World Federation of Trade Unions and its industrial departments. Referring to the current situation of the world trade union movement, he pointed out that the peace proposals recently put forward by the governments of China and North Korea have been warmly welcomed by the people of Asia and other continents. The meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which was held in Vienna a week ago, called on workers in all continents to redouble their efforts and use all means of pressure to strive for an immediate armistice in Korea and a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. He said: On the issue of peaceful coexistence, the special task of trade unions is to encourage the establishment of economic policies based on broad trade relations in their own countries, in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries, in order to oppose the discriminatory policies currently implemented by imperialism. This special action of trade unions will effectively and concretely support trade unions in participating in the struggle for national independence and national liberation. Speaking of the Third World Trade Union Congress to be held in October this year, he emphasized that unified action is the basis for the success of all trade union activities and the actions of male and female workers; helping countries achieve unified action and a unified trade union movement is the basic position of the World Federation of Trade Unions. At the end of Louis Saillant's speech, the audience once again stood up and applauded warmly.

All the participants unanimously stood up to welcome Goroshkin, the head of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation and Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, who walked to the podium. He extended heartfelt fraternal congratulations to the representatives of the congress and the Chinese people on behalf of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. (Full text on page 2)

After Goroshkin's speech, the Soviet Trade Union Delegation presented a banner to the congress. The audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time. The banner was crimson, with a colored portrait of the great Stalin embroidered on one side, and the words "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet people and the great Chinese people!" in gold Chinese and Soviet characters. The other side was embroidered with the words "Workers of the world, unite!" and other words. Goroshkin said: "This banner is a symbol of the unbreakable great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!" He shouted: "Long live the Chinese trade unions! Long live the great Chinese people! Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!" Liu Ningyi expressed his gratitude on behalf of the congress, saying: "The Chinese working class has always followed the path instructed by Lenin and Stalin. Therefore, it has achieved growth and victory. We will strengthen the unity between China and the Soviet Union and defend world peace with practical actions such as strengthening unity and strengthening learning from the Soviet Union."

After the Soviet delegation presented the banner, representatives of workers from Beijing and Tianjin successively presented flowers and banners to the congress.
