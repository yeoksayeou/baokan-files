    American Newspapers and the Kuomintang Remnant Bandit Gang Spread Rumors
    Xinhua News Agency Ordered to Refute Them
   [Xinhua News Agency, May 9th] According to a report in the New York Herald Tribune on May 7th, Gu Weijun, an agent of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang in the United States, shamelessly claimed that the People's Republic of China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had concluded a tripartite agreement in November 1952. According to this agreement, the People's Republic of China promised to dispatch 300,000 troops to Vietnam if the Democratic Republic of Vietnam needed them, and promised to assist Vietnam in combat with its air force if necessary. The Soviet Union, in turn, promised to supply the Vietnamese army with weapons and ammunition to equip five divisions.
    Xinhua News Agency is instructed to issue a statement: The above-mentioned news fabricated by the Kuomintang bandit gang and spread by American newspapers is a complete and malicious fabrication, the purpose of which is to confuse world public opinion in order to further interfere in and directly participate in the war in Indochina.

    美报和国民党残余匪帮造谣
    新华社奉命驳斥
   【新华社九日讯】根据美国纽约“先驱论坛报”五月七日消息，国民党残余匪帮在美国的代理人顾维钧竟无耻声称，中华人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和越南民主共和国已于一九五二年十一月缔结了一项三边协定，根据这项协定，中华人民共和国应许在越南民主共和国需要时，派遣三十万军队到越南去，并答应于必要时以空军协助越南作战，苏联则答应供给越南军队以装备五个师的武器和弹药。
    新华社奉命发表声明：上述国民党匪帮所制造的、并为美国报纸所散布的消息完全是别有用意的、彻头彻尾的捏造，其目的在于想迷惑世界舆论，以便进一步干涉并直接参加印度支那的战争。
