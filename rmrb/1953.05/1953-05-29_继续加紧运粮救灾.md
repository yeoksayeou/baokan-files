    Continue to Intensify Grain Transportation for Disaster Relief

    The production and self-salvation struggle launched by our Party and the People's Government to lead the people in disaster areas has achieved initial victories. The mood of the masses in the disaster areas is gradually stabilizing. The work of rescuing wheat and sowing autumn crops is being actively carried out. Grain from all over the country is being shipped to the disaster areas to help tens of millions of disaster victims overcome the spring famine. However, because many of the areas hit by natural disasters this year are grain-producing areas, and many of these areas suffered from famine last year, the people's lives are already very difficult. In addition, this year's wheat harvest is poor, and a summer famine is inevitable after the spring famine. Therefore, we must carry out continuous and arduous work to further lead the people in the disaster areas to prevent and overcome the summer famine and strive for a better autumn harvest.

    The experience of production and disaster relief work in various regions has proven that the firm determination of the leading organs, correct measures, and the good work style and methods of the vast number of cadres play a decisive role in overcoming disasters. After encountering disasters, farmers constantly demand that our Party and the People's Government lead them to overcome the disasters. As long as the leading organs have a firm attitude, take appropriate measures, and the vast number of cadres truly work with the masses to come up with practical and feasible methods for production and self-salvation, the pessimistic and despairing mood of the disaster victims can be quickly transformed, thereby uniting around the Party and the People's Government and actively fighting against the disaster. Therefore, at all levels, leading organs must maintain a clear head in the face of severe disasters, correctly assess the disaster situation, appropriately arrange their work, and organize cadres from various systems and forces from all aspects into the central task of production and disaster relief; they must send responsible personnel to lead capable cadres to go deep into the disaster areas, comfort and help the disaster victims, solve various practical difficulties, enable the disaster victims to establish confidence in production and self-salvation, and launch a production and disaster relief movement. Regarding the issue of reducing and exempting burdens, which is of greatest concern to the masses in the disaster areas, all localities should strictly abide by the policies of reasonable burden and legal reduction and exemption already determined by the State Council of the Central People's Government, especially the recently promulgated measures on reducing and exempting taxes in disaster-stricken areas, and widely publicize them to the masses in the disaster areas to enhance the disaster victims' full confidence in carrying out production and self-salvation and overcoming the disaster.

    At present, some leading organs in the disaster areas, seeing that the spring famine has been basically overcome, have developed a sense of complacency and relaxation, which is very dangerous. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance, consolidate and develop the existing achievements in production and disaster relief, and continue to intensify the work of transporting grain for disaster relief. To overcome the summer famine, we must, of course, do a lot of work. We must not only actively lead the disaster victims to rescue wheat, complete the sowing of autumn crops, and engage in conditional sideline production; we must also help the disaster victims solve the problem of funds, find production avenues, and ensure the marketing of products; at the same time, in order to protect livestock for the benefit of future production development, we must also help the disaster victims solve the problem of livestock feed and medical treatment; in order to sow early-maturing crops to avoid a shortage of food before the autumn harvest, we must also help the disaster victims solve the problem of lack of seeds and planting techniques. However, to make these tasks possible, we must first do a good job in transporting grain for disaster relief. We must supply the disaster victims with the necessary grain to maintain their physical strength so that they have the strength to engage in agricultural and sideline production and solve their difficulty in lacking seeds.

    To solve the problem of grain supply in the disaster areas, work must be carried out in two aspects. On the one hand, we must make good use of disaster relief funds and grains, achieve appropriate allocation and timely distribution, and persuade disaster victims to use disaster relief funds and grains to implement production and self-salvation, and strive to avoid sitting idle and exhausting resources; on the other hand, we must rationally use the existing commodity grain and truly distribute it to the disaster victims who need grain the most. Some unscrupulous merchants take advantage of the disaster, stir up trouble, hoard grain and drive up prices, disrupt the market, and even depress prices to "buy green" (buy crops before they are harvested), and purchase state commodity grain in sets, which is absolutely not allowed. We must strictly manage the grain market and resolutely stop the illegal behavior of unscrupulous merchants hoarding grain. The key to managing the grain market well is to correctly grasp the price policy, adjust grain through the price policy, guide mass consumption, and mobilize grain from non-disaster areas to fully support the disaster areas. The grain departments should fully understand the needs of the masses and the situation of grain stocks, and under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, closely cooperate with the industrial and commercial administrative departments, and rely closely on supply and marketing cooperatives to ensure the supply of grain in the disaster areas.

    The core of grain supply work in the disaster areas is to strengthen dispatch and transportation. Our country's existing commodity grain is sufficient to meet the needs of the market. If it is dispatched and transported well, it can completely support the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster. However, most of our country's commodity grain is scattered, and the areas with surplus grain are mostly areas with inconvenient transportation, which creates major difficulties for grain transportation work. In April and May this year, the Central Grain Department has already dispatched and transported more than 500,000 tons of grain to supply the urban population and the people in the disaster areas, which has stabilized grain prices across the board and gradually reduced grain prices in the disaster areas. This experience must be well summarized in order to further complete the greater task of dispatching and transporting grain to supply the needs of the disaster areas. All areas with grain transportation tasks must list grain transportation work as a central task, mobilize the strength of various systems and all the people, and do their best to do it well. This requires unified leadership and the establishment of a unified command and dispatching mechanism headed by responsible Party and government cadres, and resolutely overcoming the decentralized phenomenon of each doing its own thing and the disjointed phenomenon of wasting manpower and material resources. All localities must formulate practical and feasible transportation plans and strengthen the organization of grain transportation work. To this end, based on accurate investigation materials, we must take into account both the actual difficulties of areas with surplus grain and the living habits of the people in areas lacking grain, and strive to avoid subjective and blind formulation of transportation plans. At the same time, we must establish a set of departure, loading and unloading, handover, and processing systems according to various transportation conditions, and strengthen organizational leadership and business guidance in all links. In areas with heavy grain transportation tasks, necessary rescue and reception institutions should also be established, and a graded responsibility system for safety should be established to ensure the safety of grain transporters and livestock and to prevent and overcome chaotic phenomena. During the busy farming season, in order to complete the grain transportation task, it is necessary to implement the policy of ensuring both grain transportation and production, first dispatching grain from areas with relatively convenient transportation, taking care of the farming season as much as possible; and on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, organizing mutual assistance and labor exchange between farmers engaged in production at home and migrant workers transporting grain outside. Some areas have created a short-distance relay transportation method, so that each migrant worker's time away from home does not exceed two or three days, so as not to excessively hinder production. This method is very popular with farmers and should be promoted.

### 继续加紧运粮救灾

    继续加紧运粮救灾
    我们的党和人民政府领导灾区人民开展的生产自救的斗争，已经取得了初步的胜利。灾区群众的情绪逐步稳定了。抢救小麦、播种大秋作物的工作正在积极进行。全国各地的粮食源源运抵灾区，帮助几千万灾民渡过春荒。但是，由于今年遭受天灾的地区多半是产粮区，其中许多地区去年就有灾荒，群众生活已很困难，加上今年小麦歉收，春荒之后，还不免要发生夏荒，因此，我们必须进行持续的艰苦的工作，进一步领导灾区人民防止和克服夏荒，争取一个较好的秋收。
    各地生产救灾工作的经验证明，领导机关坚定的决心、正确的措施和广大干部良好的工作作风和工作方法，对于战胜灾荒具有决定性的作用。农民在遭遇灾荒之后，时时刻刻要求我们党和人民政府领导他们战胜灾荒。只要领导机关态度坚定，措施得当，广大干部真正和群众一起想出切实可行的生产自救的办法，灾民的悲观失望的情绪就能迅速转变，从而团结在党和人民政府的周围，积极和灾荒作斗争。因此，各级领导机关在严重的灾荒面前，必须保持清醒的头脑，正确地估计灾情，适当地安排自己的工作，把各系统的干部，各方面的力量，都组织到生产救灾的中心任务中来；必须派遣负责的人员，带领得力的干部，深入灾区，慰问并帮助灾民，解决各种实际的困难，使灾民树立起生产自救的信心，开展生产救灾运动。各地对于灾区群众最关心的减免负担的问题，应严格遵照中央人民政府政务院已经确定的合理负担、依法减免的政策，特别是最近颁布的关于受灾地区减免税收的办法，向灾区群众广泛宣传，以提高灾民进行生产自救、渡过灾荒的充分信心。
    目前有些灾区的领导机关看见春荒已经基本渡过，竟产生了一种自满、松劲的思想，这是非常危险的。我们必须保持高度的警惕，把目前已有的生产救灾的成绩巩固和发展起来，再接再厉地加紧运粮救灾的工作。我们为了战胜夏荒，当然要做很多工作。我们不但要积极领导灾民抢救小麦、完成大秋作物的播种，进行有条件的副业生产；还要帮助灾民解决资金问题，找寻生产门路，保证产品推销；同时，为了保护牲畜以利今后生产的发展，还必须帮助灾民解决牲畜饲料和医疗的问题；为了播种早熟作物以免除秋收前缺乏口粮的现象，还必须帮助灾民解决缺乏种籽和种植技术的问题。但是，要使这些工作成为可能，首先必须做好运粮救灾的工作。我们必须供应灾民以必要的粮食，维持灾民的体力，才能使他们有力量去进行农业生产和副业生产，并解决他们缺乏种籽的困难。
    解决灾区的粮食供应问题，要从两方面进行工作。一方面要很好地运用救灾粮款，作到适当分配，适时发放，并说服灾民利用救灾粮款实行生产自救，力戒坐吃山空；一方面要合理地运用现有的商品粮食，真正把它分配到最需要粮食的灾民手里。有些奸商乘人之危，兴风作浪，囤粮居奇，扰乱市场，甚至压价“买青”，并套购国家的商品粮食，这是绝对不能容许的。我们必须严格管理粮食市场，坚决制止奸商囤粮的违法行为。管好粮食市场的关键是正确地掌握价格政策，通过价格政策调剂粮食，指导群众的消费；并动员非灾区的粮食，全力支援灾区。粮食部门应该充分明了群众的需要和粮食库存的情况，在当地党政机关领导下，和工商行政部门密切配合，紧紧地依靠供销合作社，以保证灾区粮食的供应。
    灾区粮食供应工作的中心是加强调运。我们国家现有的商品粮食足够供应市场的需要，如果调运得好，完全可以支援灾区人民渡过灾荒。但是，我们国家的商品粮食多数是分散的，而有余粮的地区又多是交通不便的地区，这就给运粮工作造成了重大的困难。今年四、五月份，中央粮食部已经调运了五十多万吨粮食，供应城市人口和灾区人民，使粮价全面稳定，使灾区粮价逐步下跌。这个经验必须很好地加以总结，以便进一步去完成调运粮食供应灾区需要的更大任务。一切有运粮任务的地区，必须把运粮工作列为中心的任务，动员各个系统和全体人民的力量，极力把它作好。这就必须实行统一领导，建立以党政负责干部为首的统一指挥调运的机构，坚决克服各自为政的分散现象和浪费人力物力的脱节现象。各地必须制订切实可行的调运计划，加强运粮的组织工作。为此，必须按照准确的调查材料，既要照顾有余粮地区的实际困难，又要照顾缺粮地区人民的生活习惯，力戒主观盲目地制订调运计划。同时，必须按照各种运输条件，建立一套启运、装卸、接交、加工的制度，并在各个环节上加强组织领导和业务指导。在运粮任务繁重的地区，还应该设立必要的救护、招待的机构，建立按级负责的安全责任制度，以保障运粮人畜的安全，防止与克服混乱现象。在农忙季节，为完成运粮任务，又必须实行运粮、生产两不误的方针，首先调运交通比较便捷地区的粮食，尽可能地照顾农时；并在自愿两利的基础上，组织在家生产的农民和外出运粮的民工之间的互助变工。有些地区创造了短途接力运输的办法，使每个民工外出时间不超过两三天，以免过多地妨碍生产。这种办法很受农民的欢迎，应该加以推广。
