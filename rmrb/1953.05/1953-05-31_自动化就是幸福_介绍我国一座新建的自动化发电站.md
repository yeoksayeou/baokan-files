Automation is Happiness
    ——Introducing a Newly Built Automated Power Plant in China
    Ji Yin
    At dawn on March 3rd, in a certain city in Northeast China, a large-scale, new type of automated power plant began its first day of operation. The smoke spewing from the tall chimneys and cooling towers obscured the dawn sky. Hundreds of tons of coal were continuously transported by conveyor belts to the boiler room, ground into fine powder, and then fed into the fiercely burning giant boilers. The latest-style turbine generators rotated smoothly. The green lights on the machines flashed with a quiet light, indicating that everything was proceeding safely. ... At this time, the power plant's engineers and Soviet experts, led by Kabulanov, stood excitedly in front of the distribution panel in the power plant's command center—the distribution room—watching the pointer of the load meter; the pointer slowly moved, moved, and rose to its peak. It told people: electricity was being transmitted outwards, and a powerful power plant, in the first spring of our country's Five-Year Plan construction, had victoriously joined the great ranks of the motherland's industrial construction.

    This is a new type of power plant built entirely according to the advanced technical standards of socialism. Its entire production process—from the train tipping coal into the coal hopper, the pulverizer sending the coal powder into the boiler, to the generation of powerful electricity—is fully automated. The complete set of modern scientific equipment gives this power plant a new look that is completely different from China's old power plants. The emergence of this power plant, along with several new power plants under construction across the country, marks the beginning of a new era in China's power industry—an era of building China's powerful power industry with advanced Soviet technology.

    Automation Brings Workers the Greatest
    Safety
    The most important thing for a power plant is to ensure safe power transmission, keeping the thousands of machines in factories running and the street lights always bright. Therefore, whether power transmission is safe has become the main measure of whether a power plant is technologically advanced.

    The highly automated scientific equipment in this new power plant ensures that all workers in the plant work happily in a very safe environment.

    I visited the power plant's boiler workshop. Countless large and small pipes crisscrossed the huge factory building, tightly surrounding the boiler, which was tens of meters high. This behemoth is the most difficult part of the power plant to deal with; a raging fire with a temperature of over 1400 degrees Celsius burns all day long. If the water supply is cut off for just thirty seconds, it will immediately burn the entire boiler dry, causing a terrible explosion that could overturn the entire factory. A worker at the power plant told me: during the puppet Manchurian period, he encountered such an accident in a power plant: with a deafening loud noise, the factory building collapsed in a cloud of smoke and fire, and boiler fragments flew like shrapnel, two Japanese working beside the boiler were blown to pieces and disappeared without a trace. According to a statistic in a past electrical industry magazine, during the rule of the Kuomintang bandits and the enemy puppets, an average of one power plant boiler explosion accident occurred every month in the country. But here, this temperamental boiler has been subdued by a set of automated instruments. Dozens of ingenious "explosion-proof doors" are installed around the boiler. These "explosion-proof doors" are normally tightly closed and have no impact on the boiler's combustion, but when the temperature inside the boiler suddenly rises for some reason and there is a risk of explosion, these dozens of "explosion-proof doors" will automatically open at the same time, the hot air inside the furnace will escape through these doors, and the boiler will be safe and sound.

    In several workshops of the power plant, there is also a very interesting device: automatic accident lighting and alarms. This is a close partnership and the most loyal friend of the workers. As soon as a part of the machine is about to malfunction, the red light of the accident lighting comes on, and a line of words is clearly displayed in the red light, clearly stating the location and problem of the accident, calling on the workers to hurry up and repair it. To compensate for the lack of sound in the light, its partner—the alarm—emits a long "woo-woo" sound that can be heard throughout the workshop.

    "Explosion-proof doors" and accident lighting are not the most important automatic equipment in ensuring safe production. In this power plant, the most important and ingenious thing is: the possibility of errors has been completely eliminated in many parts of the machine. The machine parts are cleverly organized according to the working procedure, only allowing workers to use them correctly and not allowing workers to make mistakes. If an unskilled worker makes a mistake in operating the machine (i.e., misoperation), this part of the machine will resolutely refuse to obey commands and will not move, and the alarm will immediately sound unhappily until the worker corrects the mistake. Not only that, in order to prevent accidents in any case, many important parts of the machine here are also equipped with two sets of automatic equipment. If one set fails, the other set will automatically take over the work without hesitation. For example, if the main oil pump supplying lubricating oil to the generator fails, another electric oil pump will automatically take over the oil supply without interruption; if one of the coal powder conveying pipelines is blocked and cannot be passed, another road will immediately be opened; if one of the water supply pumps is short of water or loses power, another water pump will automatically join in, and the water will continue to flow continuously.

    Automation Liberates Workers from Heavy
    Physical Labor
    If it is said that in many factories in New China, workers are no longer slaves of machines but have become the masters of machines, then in this new type of power plant, due to the emergence of many new automated machines, this new relationship is more clearly expressed. The result of high automation not only ensures that work can be carried out more accurately and safely, but also liberates workers from heavy physical labor.

    In China's old power plants, due to backward and simple equipment, many cumbersome and dangerous tasks had to be performed by workers using their hands and shoulders instead of machines, and the work was very tiring. For example, one of the most important tasks in managing the boiler is to grasp its "mood"—the temperature—at any time. In the old power plants, to understand the temperature of each part of the boiler, dozens of thermometers had to be inserted into each part of the boiler, and the operating workers had to run up and down all day long, checking these dozens of thermometers again and again. This is precisely the epitome of China's general old power plants.

    But in this new type of power plant, workers have truly become commanders of machines. Here, a large amount of coal no longer needs to be carried by workers. Automatic machinery replaces the shoulders of workers. Hundreds of tons of coal are automatically dumped from the train into the coal pool. An automatic coal receiving system uses conveyor belts to send the coal into the machine, grinds the hard coal into powder, and then blows it into the combustion chamber of the boiler with wind power, completely eliminating the need for people to handle it. All three workshops here are equipped with a sophisticated silver-gray machine. Above the machine is a row of buttons. All the mysteries of operating the machine are in these buttons. Workers no longer need to run around all day long. Just sit here and you can command the entire machine to work normally: just press a button, and the hundreds of kilograms of valves hundreds of meters away will lightly open or close. You want to open it as much as you want it to open; to understand the temperature of each part of the boiler, there is no need to run there again. Just reach out and twist the thermometer switch in front of you, and the correct number will immediately jump out...

    Automation is Happiness
    New-style automated machinery and equipment bring unlimited happiness to workers and create a good working environment for them.

    All low-heat pipelines in this power plant are wrapped with four layers of insulation materials such as asbestos boards, and high-heat areas are wrapped several times more. These insulation equipment can be used for fifteen years. This greatly reduces the temperature in the power plant's workshops, and people work here as if they were working in an office. This not only protects the health of the workers but also saves heat. People often think that the factory workshop must be noisy with the rumbling of machines—this old concept is no longer applicable here. The turbine room is very quiet, and the cylindrical turbine generator is running quietly. Zhu, an engineer in the turbine room, told me that the equipment of this turbine generator is also first-class in the Soviet Union. Its vibration coefficient is only 0.03 mm, which means that its vibration amplitude is only equivalent to the thickness of a cigarette tin foil. This is why the room can be so quiet.

    In short, in this new type of power plant, every wire and every screw embodies infinite care and protection for the workers: all low-voltage wires in the plant are wrapped in lead pipes and lead snake-skin pipes, and no inch of wire is exposed outside. All places where people need to walk and carry out maintenance work are equipped with sturdy railings and ladders. Because the equipment of the machine is very precise, there is no dust in the factory building, and the air is very good. Soon, a machine for removing fine ash will also be installed in the boiler room, and even a little bit of fine dust will be removed.

    The automation equipment in this new type of power plant has not yet been fully completed. Now, when they work, they still have to press the buttons by hand or turn the "remote operator." But when all the automatic devices are completed, even the effort of pressing the buttons will no longer be needed. People only need to sit there and look at the instruments. The machine will automatically add coal and water according to the electrical load, and everything will be carried out automatically and in an orderly manner. This equipment is estimated to be completed this year.

    The emergence of new factories also raises a series of new questions for people: it requires people to organize production in new ways; it requires workers and technicians to have higher technical knowledge to use new machines... Zhou Junmei, a technician in the boiler room, said: Now everyone feels that the biggest problem is that the old technology cannot adapt to the new requirements. Many automatic equipment in this power plant have already been installed, but they have not yet been used. This is because to master those more complex instruments, people must have a technical improvement. Now, the workers and technicians of the power plant are enthusiastically learning with the warm help of Soviet experts.

    With the large-scale development of China's industrial construction and the rapid improvement of people's lives, people's requirements for building new power plants are becoming more and more urgent. The birth of this new power plant precisely shows that China's power industry has begun to enter a new historical period. Many such new types of power plants will appear successively in all parts of the motherland, and they will illuminate the vast urban and rural areas of New China like a garden. (Attached pictures)

    This power plant was built with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The picture shows Soviet experts guiding workers in managing automated equipment.

    This is the "operation panel" of the power plant. Workers only need to sit here and press the buttons to command the entire machine to work automatically.

    This is the huge cyclone separator on top of the power plant. It mixes coal powder and air and sends it into the boiler for combustion.

   自动化就是幸福
    ——介绍我国一座新建的自动化发电站
    季音
    三月三日黎明，在东北的某个城市里，一座规模巨大的、新型的自动化发电站开始了第一天的工作。高大的烟囱和冷却塔喷吐出来的烟雾，遮住了黎明的天空。成百吨的煤块不断地被传送带送到锅炉间，碾成粉屑后，再投进熊熊燃烧着的巨大锅炉里。最新式的透平发电机均匀地转动着。机器上的绿灯闪动着幽静的光，表明一切都在安全地进行。……这时候，发电站的工程师们、以卡布拉诺夫为首的苏联专家们都兴奋地伫立在发电站的司令台——配电间的配电盘前，注视着负荷仪表的指针；指针慢慢地移动着，移动着，一直升到了顶点。它告诉人们：电力已往外输送，一座强大的发电站在我们祖国开始五年建设的第一个春天，胜利地加入了祖国工业建设的伟大行列。
    这是一座完全按照社会主义先进的技术水平建设起来的新型的发电站。它的整个的生产过程——从火车把煤倾入煤斗，粉煤器又把煤粉送入锅炉开始，一直到强大的电力发出为止，全部都是自动进行的。全套近代化的科学设备，使得这座发电站具有与我国旧有的发电站截然不同的新面貌。这座发电站和全国正在同时建设中的几座新发电站的出现，标明我国电力工业开始进入一个新的时期——以苏联的先进技术建设我国强大的电力工业的时期。
    自动化给工人带来了最大的
    安全
    发电站头等重要的事情，就是如何保证安全送电，让工厂里的千百部机器不停地运转，马路上的电灯始终明亮。因此，送电是否安全，就成了发电站技术上是否先进的主要测量器。
    这座新型发电站里的高度自动化的科学设备，保证全厂工人在十分安全的环境中愉快地工作着。
    我参观了发电站的锅炉车间。无数大大小小的管道曲曲折折地布满了这个巨大的厂房，把数十公尺高的锅炉紧紧包围在中间。这个庞然大物是发电厂中最难对付的部分，一千四百度以上高温的烈火整日在燃烧着，只要断水三十秒钟，它立刻就会把整个锅炉烧干，酿成可怕的爆炸事故，把整个工厂掀翻过来。发电站的一个工人告诉我：在伪满时期，他在一个发电厂里就曾碰到过这样一次事故：随着震天动地的一声巨响，厂房在一片迷漫的烟火中崩塌了，锅炉碎片像弹片一样四飞，两个在锅炉边工作的日本人被炸得踪影全无。据过去一本电业杂志的统计，在国民党匪帮和敌伪统治时期，全国平均每月要发生一次发电厂锅炉爆炸事故。但在这里，这个脾气暴躁的锅炉已经被一套自动化仪器驾驭得服服贴贴了。这个锅炉周围装置着数十扇巧妙的“防爆门”，这些“防爆门”平时紧紧地关闭着，对于锅炉的燃烧毫无影响，但当锅炉内部因为某种原因热度骤然上升而有爆炸危险的时候，这数十扇“防爆门”会一齐自动打开，炉内的热气从这些门里跑出来，锅炉就安然无恙。
    在发电站的几个车间里，还有一套十分有趣的装置：自动事故照明和警报器。这是一对亲密的伙伴，是工人们最忠实的朋友。只要机器的那一部分将要发生故障，事故照明的红灯就亮了，红色的灯光里清楚地显现出一行字来，上面清楚地写明发生事故的地点和问题，招呼工人们赶快去修理。为了弥补灯光没有声音的缺点，它的伙伴——警报器就发出“呜呜”的长鸣，叫得整个车间都可听见。
    “防爆门”和事故照明还不是保证安全生产中最重要的自动设备。在这座发电站里，最重要也是最巧妙的是：在机器的许多部分上，已经完全消除了发生错误的可能。机件按照工作程序巧妙地组织起来，只准工人正确使用，不准工人发生错误。如果一个不熟练工人在操作的时候开错了机器（即误操作）这部分机器就会坚决拒绝指挥，毫不动弹，而且警报器立即不平地鸣叫起来，直到这个工人纠正错误为止。不仅如此，为了防止事故万一的袭击，这里机器的许多重要部分还同时装有二套自动设备，如果一套发生了故障，另一套就会毫不迟疑地自动代替工作。譬如给发电机送润滑油的主油泵发生故障了，另一座电动油泵就会自动接替送油，毫不间断；输送煤粉的管路那一路阻塞了送不过去，另一条道路立即通行了；输送水的给水泵一台缺水或断水了，另一台水泵就会自动参加，水依然源源不绝地流着。
    自动化使工人们从繁重的
    体力劳动中解放出来
    如果说，在新中国的许多工厂里，工人们已经不再是机器的奴隶，而成了机器的主人，那么在这座新型发电站里，由于许多新式的自动化机器的出现，这种新关系是更显明地表现出来了。高度自动化的结果，不仅保证了工作能更准确、更安全地进行，而且使工人们开始从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来。
    在我国的旧发电厂里，由于设备的落后和简陋，许多笨重的危险的工作，都必须由工人们用手和肩膀去代替机器，工作是十分劳累的。例如，管理锅炉的最重要工作之一，就是随时掌握它的“情绪”——温度。在旧发电厂里，要了解锅炉各部的温度，就必须把数十根温度表插在锅炉的各部分，运转工人整天不停地跑上跑下，一遍又一遍地察看这数十根温度表。这正是我国一般旧发电厂的缩影。
    但是在这座新型发电站里，工人们真正成了机器的指挥官，在这里，大量的燃煤已不需要由工人挑运了，自动机械代替了工人们的肩膀。成百吨的煤从火车里自动倒进煤池，一套自动的受煤系统用传送带把煤送进机器，把坚硬的煤块磨成粉末，再用风力吹进锅炉的燃烧室，完全不需要人去搬弄。这里的三个车间里都安置着一部精巧的银灰色的机器，机器上面是一排排的电钮，全部操纵机器的奥妙都在这些电钮里。工人们再不要整日奔波不休，只要坐在这里，就可以指挥整部机器正常地进行工作：只要一按电钮，数百公尺以外的成百斤重的阀门便轻轻地打开或者闭上了，你要打开多大，它就能开多大；要了解锅炉各部的温度，也毋须再跑到那里去，只要伸手一拧面前的温度计开关，正确的数字立即就跳了出来，……
    自动化就是幸福
    新式的自动化的机器设备给工人们带来了无限的幸福，给工人们创建了良好的劳动环境。
    这座发电厂中所有低热的管道都包扎了石棉板等四道保温装置，高热的地方还要多几倍。这些保温设备可以保用十五年。这就使得这座发电站车间里的温度大为降低，人们在这里工作，就仿佛在办公室里工作一样。这不仅保护了工人的健康，而且节约了热量。人们常常认为工厂车间里一定是机器声隆隆不绝，嘈杂得很——这个旧概念在这里也已不适用了。透平间内安静得很，圆柱形的透平发电机在静静地运转着。透平间朱工程师告诉我，这座透平发电机的装置，在苏联也是第一流的，它的震动系数仅零点零三粍，就是说，它震动的幅度只相等于一张香烟锡纸那么厚，这就是室内能如此安静的原因。
    总之，在这座新型发电站里，每一根电线，每一颗螺丝，都体现着对于工人无限的关怀和保护：厂内所有低压电线都用铅管和铅制的蛇皮管子包着，没有一寸电线露在外边。所有要行走和要作检修工作的地方，都装置了牢固的栏杆和梯子。因为机器的装置很精密，厂房里没有什么灰尘，空气很好。不久，锅炉间还要装置一套除细灰的机器，即使一点细微的尘埃，人们也要把它清除干净。
    这座新型发电站的自动化装置还没有全部完成。现在他们工作的时候，还要用手去按电钮，或者转一下“远方操作器”。但当自动装置全部完成后，那时即使连按电钮的举手之劳也可以不要了，人们只要坐在那里看看仪表，机器自动根据电的负荷加煤和添水，一切都自动地有条不紊地进行。这些设备估计今年可以完成。
    新的工厂的出现，也向人们提出了一系列新的问题：它要求人们用新的方法来组织生产；它要求工人和技术人员有更高的技术知识，来使用新的机器，……锅炉间技术员周君美说：现在大家感到一个最大的问题，就是旧的技术不能适应新的要求，这座发电站里有许多自动设备都早已安装好了，但现在还没有使用，这就是因为要掌握那些更复杂的仪器，人们必须在技术上有一个提高。现在，发电站的工人和技术人员们在苏联专家的热忱帮助下，正在热情地学习着。
    随着我国工业建设的大规模开展，人民生活的迅速上升，人们对于建设新发电站的要求是愈来愈迫切了。这座新发电站的诞生，正是说明了我国电力工业已开始进入一个新的历史时期，许多这样新型的发电站，将要陆续出现在祖国各地，它们将要把新中国的广大城乡，照耀得像一座花园一样。（附图片）

    这是发电站的“操作盘”。工人们只要坐在这里按电钮，就可以指挥整部机器自动地进行工作。
    这是发电站顶上巨大的旋风分离器。它把煤粉和空气混合起来，送进锅炉里去燃烧。
