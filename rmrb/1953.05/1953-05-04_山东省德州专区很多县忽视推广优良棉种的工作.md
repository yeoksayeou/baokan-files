Reader's Letters Abstract

    Many Counties in Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, Neglect the Work of Promoting Superior Cotton Seeds
    Liu Hao from the Dezhou Prefectural Administrative Office Finance and Economics Committee writes: The cotton planting season is imminent, but a large quantity of "Si" character "Wu'ai" cotton seeds are stockpiled in Pingyuan, Yucheng, Xiajin, Enxian, and Wucheng counties of Dezhou Prefecture. The Dezhou Prefecture planned to promote 16.3 million jin of "Si" character "Wu'ai" cotton seeds and stipulated that they should be distributed to cotton farmers before the end of February; however, by March 24th, only 5,136,500 jin of improved seeds had been distributed to cotton farmers throughout the region, accounting for only 31 percent of the planned promotion. A large quantity of cotton seeds are stockpiled in Yucheng, Pingyuan, Xiajin, Enxian, Wucheng, Qihe, and Jiyang counties. More seriously, a large quantity of high-quality cotton seeds have rotted due to poor storage. Shanghe and Leling counties alone have had 50,000 jin rot. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the leading organs of many counties do not attach importance to the work of promoting superior varieties, only assigning it to the business departments without supervising and inspecting or providing specific guidance. The business departments have a passive attitude of "sitting and waiting for customers" and do not actively promote to cotton farmers. Some counties (such as Xiajin) even rigidly emphasize "pay first, then get cotton seeds"; some cotton farmers in some counties requested to exchange miscellaneous cotton seeds for superior cotton seeds, but were wrongly rejected by the cooperatives; and some counties (such as Jiyang) cooperatives were busy running training courses and neglected the work of promoting superior cotton seeds. These situations are obviously wrong and should be quickly corrected by all counties.

    山东省德州专区很多县忽视推广优良棉种的工作
    德州专署财政经济委员会刘浩来信：棉花播种工作已迫在眉睫，但德州专区平原、禹城、夏津、恩县、武城等县却积压大批斯字五爱棉种。德州专区计划推广斯字五爱棉种一千六百三十万斤，并规定二月底以前发到棉农手中；但到三月二十四日，全区发到棉农手中去的良种仅五百一十三万六千五百斤，仅占推广计划数的百分之三十一。禹城、平原、夏津、恩县、武城、齐河、济阳等县都积压了大批棉种。更为严重的是，由于保管不善，已有大批优良棉种霉烂。商河、乐陵两县即霉烂了五万斤。造成这种现象的主要原因，是很多县的领导机关对推广优良品种工作不重视，只推给业务部门去做，而不去督促检查，不作具体指导。而业务部门有着“坐门等客”的消极情绪，不积极主动地对棉农进行宣传。甚至有的县（如夏津）硬性强调“先纳钱，后给棉种”；有些县的棉农要求以杂棉种换优良棉种，也被合作社错误地拒绝；有的县（如济阳）合作社忙于办训练班，放松了推广优良棉种的工作。这些情况显然是错误的，各县应该迅速纠正。
