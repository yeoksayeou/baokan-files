Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st TASS: An editorial in the American "Washington Post" commented on the Korean armistice negotiations, saying: "During the recess of the Korean armistice negotiations, our decision-makers should reconsider the U.S. position. We risk losing the trust of some of our allies because they believe that we have shown an irreconcilable attitude in the negotiations. ... Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the plan recently proposed by the communist side is basically 'very close' to the Indian proposal adopted by the United Nations General Assembly last December. He is not the only one criticizing the U.S. position. Winston Churchill made almost the same implication in his speech last week. Other United Nations member states with troops in Korea have the same sentiment... In any case, we must appear slightly more flexible in the negotiations in order to show our allies and China that we truly desire peace."

    要美政府改变在谈判中的立场
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：美国“华盛顿邮报”发表社论，评论朝鲜停战谈判说：“在朝鲜停战谈判休会期间，我们的决策人应当重新考虑美国的立场。我们有失去我们一些同盟者的信任的危险，因为他们认为，我们在谈判中表现出不可调和的态度。……尼赫鲁总理指出，共方不久以前提出的方案基本上‘十分近似’于去年十二月联合国大会通过的印度提案。批评美国立场的远不止他一个人。温斯顿·邱吉尔在上星期发表的演说中差不多有着同样的暗示。其他有军队在朝鲜的联合国成员国也有着同样的情绪……无论如何，我们在谈判中必须显得稍为灵活一些，以便向我们的盟国以及中国表示我们是真正希望和平的。”
