Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas are inflicting increasingly heavy blows on the French aggressor troops and the Bảo Đại puppet army in the North Vietnamese plains and Central Vietnam.

According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 12th: On the night of April 28th, the Vietnamese People's Army ambushed Nam Dinh, an important city in the southern Red River Delta, wiping out a battalion of puppet troops, killing 113 and capturing 505. The next day, the People's Army intercepted a reinforcement force of the enemy, eliminating another 100 troops. In these two days of combat, the People's Army seized one mortar, sixteen machine guns, fifty submachine guns, four hundred and fifty rifles, and many other equipment and ammunition. At the same time, one aircraft, five tanks, seventeen trucks, and eighteen machine guns were destroyed.

On the night of April 30th, the People's Army also ambushed an enemy stronghold in Ninh Binh, wiping out a company of puppet troops and seizing all their weapons.

On the left bank of the Red River, the People's Army has intensified its attacks on enemy strongholds and transportation lines in Jian'an, Xing'an, Haiyang and other provinces. In addition to wiping out three companies of enemy troops during the raid on Jian'an city, the People's Army units on the left bank of the Red River eliminated a total of three companies of enemy troops in the twelve days up to April 28th, including the elimination of one enemy company during the raid on Haiyang city on April 28th, seizing a large number of weapons and equipment.

In Central Vietnam, after the French aggressor troops were wiped out in four companies in the Guangtian area of Thừa Thiên Province, they concentrated the forces of three battalions on March 27th, supported by many armored vehicles, and advanced into the Fengzhang-Guangtai area. The invading enemy was met with a strong counterattack by the local forces of the People's Army, losing one company. On March 31st, guerrillas blew up a military train near Wenshe, north of Huế, killing a platoon of enemy troops.
