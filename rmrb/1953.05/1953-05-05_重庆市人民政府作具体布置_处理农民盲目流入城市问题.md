    Chongqing Municipal People's Government Makes Specific Arrangements
    To Handle the Problem of Peasants Blindly Flowing into Cities
    Chongqing City's relevant agencies are earnestly handling the problem of peasants blindly flowing into the city. The Chongqing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has successively invited the Public Security Bureau, the Labor Bureau, the Construction Engineering Department, and trade union organizations to two meetings, deciding to first investigate and register the number of peasants who have blindly flowed into the city from various places, and then deal with them separately according to the specific circumstances. Now, the Chongqing Municipal Labor Bureau has made specific arrangements. The public security sub-bureaus in each district of the city are responsible for carrying out the registration work. The Fourth Engineering Office of the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau has specifically sent five cadres to investigate the various work areas under its jurisdiction. The counties near Chongqing City have also paid attention to this issue. Jiangjin County recently sent cadres to Chongqing City to prepare to take back peasants from the county who came out with letters of introduction to find work.

    重庆市人民政府作具体布置
    处理农民盲目流入城市问题
    重庆市各有关机关正认真地处理农民盲目流入城市的问题。重庆市人民政府民政局已先后邀请公安局、劳动局、建筑工程部门和工会组织等开会两次，决定首先调查和登记各地盲目流入市内的农民人数，然后根据具体情况，分别处理。现在，重庆市劳动局已作具体布置。全市各区公安分局负责进行登记工作。西南建筑工程局第四工程处专门派出五个干部，到所属各工区调查。重庆市附近各县也注意了这个问题。江津县最近派干部来重庆市，准备接回由该县写介绍信出来找工作的农民。
