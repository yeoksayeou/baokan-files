Reader's Letters Excerpts:

    No Waste of Food Allowed
    Reader Zhang Mingnian writes: The Taiyuan Flour Mill in Shanxi Province is producing too much dark flour and bran during the processing of "August 1st" flour, causing a great loss to the country. In the third quarter of last year, when processing for the local grain company, the mill produced only a little over 75 jin of "August 1st" flour, and more than 2 jin of dark flour, with the rest turning into bran, from every 100 jin of wheat. Even counting the dark flour, the flour yield was only about 78 jin per 100 jin of wheat. However, when the same wheat was processed at the Yuanfeng Flour Mill in the same city, it could yield 82.79 jin of flour. In comparison, the Taiyuan Flour Mill produces 4 jin and 12 liang less flour per 100 jin of wheat. If the Taiyuan Flour Mill processes 100 million jin of wheat a year, it would produce about 4.75 million jin less flour than the Yuanfeng Flour Mill in the same city, which is a shocking waste!
    Currently, cherishing food, saving food, and increasing food production are the responsibilities of every patriotic person. Especially grain storage and enterprise departments should not only avoid wasting food, but also frequently pay attention to avoiding and reducing losses in the storage and transportation of grain, and especially pay attention to increasing production in grain processing. This not only ensures an adequate supply of grain, but also increases the country's wealth and ensures the smooth progress of the country's large-scale economic construction. Therefore, any behavior that does not cherish food and wastes food recklessly is unacceptable. It is hoped that attention will be paid to correcting this.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不允许有浪费粮食的行为
    读者张明年来信：山西省太原面粉厂，在加工“八一”粉中，出黑面和麸皮太多，给国家造成极大损失。该厂在去年第三季度给当地粮食公司加工时，每百斤小麦仅加工出七十五斤多“八一”粉，两斤多黑面，其余都变成了麸皮。连黑面都算在一起，每百斤小麦出粉也不过七十八斤左右。但用同样小麦在该市源丰面粉厂加工，却能出八十二·七九斤面粉。两相比较，太原面粉厂每百斤小麦少出面粉四斤十二两。如果太原面粉厂一年加工小麦一亿斤，就比该市源丰面粉厂加工小麦一亿斤少出面粉四百七十五万斤左右，这是何等惊人的浪费啊！
    目前，爱护粮食，节约粮食，增产粮食，是我们每一个爱国人民应有的责任。尤其是粮食保管、企业部门，不仅不应该浪费粮食，还必须经常注意避免和减少粮食在保管、运输方面的损耗，特别要注意在粮食加工中增加产量，这样，不仅是保证了粮食的充分供应，而且也替国家增加了财富，保证了国家大规模经济建设的顺利进行。因此，任何不爱护粮食、胡乱糟蹋粮食的行为，是不应该的。希望注意纠正。
