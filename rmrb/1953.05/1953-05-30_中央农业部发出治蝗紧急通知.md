Xinhua News Agency, May 29th - The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture issued an emergency notice on locust control on May 28th. The full text of the notice is as follows:

Currently, most locust nymphs in various regions have reached the third instar. In many areas, due to insufficient egg surveys, the area of summer nymph occurrence exceeds the estimates of various localities, especially in provinces such as Xinjiang and Anhui, where the area exceeds the original estimate by one or more times. The locust control work has now entered its most critical stage, and all localities must pay attention to solving the following problems:

I. The use of pesticides must be combined with sufficient manpower, and a thorough search for nymphs must be carried out to eliminate them before the third instar.

II. The control of migratory locusts should be primarily based on the use of pesticides, but supplemented by manual capture. Due to the limited availability of pesticides and equipment, they can only be used in areas with dense locust nymph populations. For sparse migratory locust nymphs, manual extermination should be organized as much as possible without using pesticides and equipment. In areas where the area of summer nymph occurrence exceeds the estimated area this year, the idea of solely relying on pesticides must be corrected to avoid mistakes.

III. If there are not enough dusters, the previously introduced cloth bag dusting method can be tried.

[This newspaper's report] Since mid-May, locust plagues have occurred in Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan and other provinces, and locust nymphs have begun to enter the third instar. Various regions are now actively and effectively carrying out locust eradication work. Xinjiang Province has found locust nymph areas of 1.65 million mu. The locust nymph hatching period is about 20 days earlier than last year. Generally, they have reached the third instar, and some have reached the fourth and fifth instars. Aircraft locust control began on May 22, and is expected to end in half a month to twenty days. In most locust areas of Jiangsu Province, locust nymphs have entered the third instar. In some areas of Donghai, Tongbei and other counties, locust nymphs have entered the fourth instar. Over 158,300 mu of locust nymph areas have been found in Peixian and Tongbei, and most locust nymphs have entered the third instar. Aircraft locust control work in Jiangsu Province also began on May 20 and is expected to end in half a month. In Anhui Province, locust egg areas of more than 800,000 mu have been found in counties along the Huai River, and more than 80% of the locust nymphs are in the first and second instars, and a few have entered the third instar. Due to climatic reasons, the area of locust occurrence has expanded nearly twice as much as expected. In Huanghua and other counties in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, locust nymphs have been found to occur on more than 39,000 mu of land, and the locust nymphs have now entered the first instar. In Fengnan County, more than 22,000 mu of land have also been found to have native locusts. In Henan Province, scattered migratory locust nymphs have been eliminated on more than 30,000 mu of land. In most locust areas of Shandong Province, locust nymphs have entered the second instar, and a small number of locust nymphs have entered the third instar. In Yishui Prefecture, the area of native locust occurrence has been found to be more than 200,000 mu.

Based on the locust nymph occurrence in various regions, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has allocated an additional 455 tons of pesticide powder to Henan and Shandong. At present, all localities must strengthen reconnaissance and grasp the locust situation, distinguish between native locusts and migratory locust species, apply spraying, dusting, baiting, manual capture and other methods, and seize the time to eliminate summer nymphs in their place of origin to ensure that they do not harm crops; individual areas where locust nymphs have entered the fourth instar must take emergency measures, organize the masses, and resolutely eliminate them. In areas where the area of locust nymph occurrence is larger than expected and where pesticide equipment is insufficient, such as Xinjiang, Anhui, and Henan, they must overcome the idea of waiting for additional pesticide equipment and vigorously organize the masses to use ditching, encirclement, netting, burning, and all other effective methods to eliminate locust nymphs.

    中央农业部发出治蝗紧急通知
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府农业部于五月二十八日发出治蝗紧急通知。通知全文如下：
    目前各地蝗蝻大部已届三龄，不少地区，因查卵不周密，夏蝻发生面积超过各地估计，特别是新疆、安徽等省超出原计面积的一倍或一倍以上。现在治蝗工作已进入最紧张阶段，各地须注意解决以下几个问题：
    一、使用药剂，必须配合足够的人力，并普遍深入查蝻，做到消灭在三龄以前。
    二、防治飞蝗，以使用药剂为主，但仍须辅以人工捕打，因药械有限，只能在蝗蝻密集地区使用，密度过稀的飞蝗跳蝻，尽可能组织人工扑灭，不用药械。今年夏蝻发生面积超过预计面积的地区，必须纠正单纯依赖药剂思想，以免误事。
    三、喷粉器不够的，可试用已介绍过的布袋撒粉法。
    【本报讯】五月中旬以来，新疆、江苏、安徽、山东、河南等省发生蝗害地区，蝗蝻开始进入三龄，各地现正积极地有效地展开灭蝗工作。新疆省查出蝗蝻面积一百六十五万亩，蝗蝻孵化期较去年约早二十天，一般已到三龄，有的已到四龄、五龄。五月二十二日开始，飞机出动治蝗，预计半个月到二十天可结束。江苏省大部蝗区，蝗蝻已进入三龄，东海、铜北等县一部分地区，蝗蝻已进入四龄。沛县、铜北两地已查出蝗蝻面积十五万八千三百多亩，大部分蝗蝻且已进入三龄。江苏省飞机治蝗工作也在五月二十日开始，预计半月结束。安徽省在沿淮河各县查出蝗卵面积八十多万亩，百分之八十以上的蝗蝻正在一龄、二龄，少数已进入三龄。因气候关系，蝗虫发生的面积较预计的扩大将近一倍。河北省沧县专区黄骅等县已发现蝗蝻在三万九千多亩的土地上发生，蝗蝻现已进入一龄。丰南县并发现二万二千多亩土地上有土蝗。河南省已在三万多亩土地上消灭了散栖型跳蝻。山东省蝗区大部分蝗蝻已进入二龄，少部分蝗蝻已进入三龄。沂水专区并发现土蝗发生的面积二十多万亩。
    中央农业部根据各地蝗蝻发生情况，已增拨河南、山东药粉四百五十五吨。目前各地必须加强侦查和掌握蝗情，分清土蝗、飞蝗种类，施用喷粉、撒粉、撒饵、人工捕打等办法，争取时间将夏蝻消灭在原产地，保证不致为害作物；蝗蝻已进入四龄的个别地区，必须采取紧急措施，组织群众，坚决予以消灭。目前蝗蝻发生的面积比预计的面积扩大，药械准备不足的地区如新疆、安徽、河南等地，必须克服等待增拨药械的思想，大力组织群众，利用挖沟、围打、网捕、火烧及其他一切有效办法消灭蝗蝻。（中央农业部植物保护司）
