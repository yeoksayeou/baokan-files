Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: Hua Luogeng, mathematician and representative of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union, spoke to our agency reporter about his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union this time.

　　Hua Luogeng first talked about the Soviet scientists' enthusiasm for caring for Chinese science and Chinese scientific workers. He said: Soviet scientists not only shared their valuable experience wholeheartedly, but also cared for us to such an extent that, for example, Academician I.M. Vinogradov, director of the Mathematics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, when introducing his knowledge, hoped that Chinese elderly professors and young scientific workers would pay more attention to rest, play ball, skate, climb mountains, etc., to maintain health and exercise their physique, and hoped that Chinese scientists would not shoulder too many administrative affairs and put more time into research work.

　　Hua Luogeng talked about Academician I.M. Vinogradov's remarks on the transformation of Soviet scientists after the October Revolution and the education of children of workers and peasants, pointing out that this passage is a very valuable experience for our country's scientists today. The gist of this passage is: After the October Revolution, Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet government cared very much about scientists, providing them with many conveniences in terms of life and research work, so that those scientists who originally held a wait-and-see attitude towards the Soviet regime gradually trusted the government. In 1920, Vinogradov taught at the Leningrad Lenin Industrial School. Many children of workers and peasants were enrolled as students there. They couldn't do arithmetic or algebra at first. At that time, some professors were very unhappy to educate these "uncultured" people. But later, these people achieved even greater success than those from intellectual backgrounds. They occupied a very important position in the Metal Academy where Vinogradov later worked and served the people faithfully.

　　Regarding Soviet mathematics, Hua Luogeng said: As early as 1950, he had systematically stated in the Chinese "Science Bulletin" that Soviet mathematics occupied the first place in the world. The situation seen during this visit further proved this point. Soviet mathematics has not missed any aspect and has no blank spots. During this visit, he more deeply understood that Soviet science (including mathematics) is a complete system, and all disciplines are closely linked, from theory to practice, one link after another. The advancement of mathematics can provide a glimpse into the advancement of other sciences and technologies, and the advancement of other sciences and technologies can also show the advancement of mathematics.

　　He said: The Soviets are not only good at applying theory to practice, but also good at seeking theoretical basis in practice. For example, we used to think that grinding glass was just technology, but the Soviet Union has specialized research institutions to seek the theory in this area. They grind glass there using various methods and conditions, and they came up with a theory to control the glass, so something that used to take dozens of days to grind, they only need a few hours.

　　Hua Luogeng said that he had visited the Soviet Union more than once. But the impression of visiting Soviet factories this time was the deepest. He compared the Soviet factories he had seen with his own eyes with the factories in capitalist countries, and he fully affirmed the superiority of socialist society. At the Leningrad Stalin Turbine Factory, he saw the turbines being manufactured, the radius of which was already difficult to imagine, but this factory also had to manufacture thirty turbines for the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station that were twice as large as that one. He said: Turbines are just a finger compared to the body of the communist construction project, which shows the magnitude of the communist construction project. The manufacturing of turbines requires precise calculations, and the long-distance high-voltage power transmission, weather forecasting, etc. in the communist construction project also require precise calculations. Everywhere we can see mathematics serving communist construction.

　　Hua Luogeng continued: In the factory, in front of the turbine, he had the following feeling. He felt that the power of the individual was very small, because such a huge object could not be made by an individual at all, but the power of the collective, the power of unity, was very great, and even such a major event as the communist construction project could be accomplished. He believes that this is a very good education for himself. He also felt the collectivist spirit of the Soviet people in scientific research institutions. In the Soviet Union, people do not distinguish between each other. For example, when a great physicist works at a chemical research institute, he is as serious and hardworking as if he were working at his own physics research institute. In capitalist countries, it is unpleasant for a scientist from one discipline to work in another scientific institution. He said: It is very necessary to learn the collectivist spirit of Soviet scientific workers and eliminate a certain degree of departmentalism and localism that may still exist among our scientific workers.

    中国科学院访苏代表团代表、数学家华罗庚
    谈学习苏联科学工作者的集体主义精神
    【新华社讯】莫斯科航讯：中国科学院访苏代表团代表、数学家华罗庚对本社记者谈述了这次在苏联访问的观感。
    华罗庚首先谈到苏联科学家关怀中国科学和中国科学工作者的热情。他说：苏联科学家不但把自己宝贵的经验倾腹相告，而且关心我们到这样程度，例如，苏联科学院数学研究所所长伊·麦·维诺格拉多夫院士在介绍自己的知识的时候，希望中国年老的教授和年青的科学工作者多注意休息、打球、滑冰、爬山等等，以保持健康和锻炼体格，并希望中国科学家不要背上很多行政事务，把更多的时间放在研究工作上。
    华罗庚谈到了伊·麦·维诺格拉多夫院士关于十月革命后苏联科学家的转变和对工农子弟的教育的一段话，指出这段话对于今天我国科学家是非常宝贵的经验。这段话大意是：十月革命之后，列宁、斯大林和苏维埃政府很关心科学家，在生活和研究工作方面给科学家许多方便条件，使那些原来对苏维埃政权抱观望态度的科学家逐渐信任政府。一九二○年维诺格拉多夫在彼得堡列宁工业学校任教。那里招收了很多工农子弟当学生。他们开始时不会算术也不会代数。当时有些教授就很不高兴教育这些“没有文化”的人。但后来这些人的成就还比知识分子出身的大。他们在维诺格拉多夫后来工作的金属学院中占很重要的地位，而且忠实地为人民服务。
    关于苏联的数学，华罗庚说：远在一九五○年，他已经在中国“科学通报”上有系统地说明苏联数学占世界第一位。这次访问中所看到的情形更证明了这一点。苏联数学没有漏掉任何一方面，没有空白点。在这次访问中，他更深刻地了解到苏联科学（包括数学）是一个完整的体系，各门科学都紧密地联系着，从理论到实际，一环接着一环，从数学的先进可以窥见别门科学和技术的先进，从别门科学和技术的先进也可以看到数学的先进。
    他说：苏联人不仅善于把理论运用到实际中去，而且善于在实际中寻求理论根据。例如，我们从前认为磨玻璃只是技术，但苏联有专门研究机构来寻求这方面的理论。那里用各种不同的方法和条件来磨玻璃，得出了控制玻璃的理论，结果平常要磨几十天的东西，那里只用几个钟头。
    华罗庚说，他访问苏联不只一次了。但以这次参观苏联工厂的印象最深。他以他亲眼看过的苏联工厂和资本主义国家的工厂比较，完全肯定了社会主义社会的优越性。他在列宁格勒斯大林透平工厂，看见制造出来的透平，其半径之大已经很难想像了，但是这个工厂还要替古比雪夫水电站制造三十个比那个大一倍的透平。他说：透平对于共产主义建设工程，不过是指头比人身，可见共产主义建设工程之大。制造透平需要精密的计算，共产主义建设工程中的远距离高压输电、气象预告等等也需要精密的计算。到处可以看到数学为共产主义建设服务。
    华罗庚接着说：在工厂里，在透平面前，他发生了这样的感想。他觉得个人的力量非常渺小，因为这样庞然大物绝非个人造得出来，但集体力量、团结起来的力量却非常大，像共产主义建设工程这样大事也办得起来。他认为这对于他自己是非常好的教育。苏联人民这种集体主义精神，他在科学研究机关也体会得到。在苏联，人们不分彼此，例如一个大物理学家到化学研究所工作时，像在自己的物理研究所工作一样，非常认真、努力。而在资本主义国家，某一门科学家到另一门科学机关工作，是不愉快的。他说：学习苏联科学工作者的集体主义精神，去掉我们科学工作者之间可能还存在的某种程度的门户之见和本位主义，是非常需要的。
