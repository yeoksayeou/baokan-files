Xinhua News Agency, Vienna dispatch from TASS, May 21: The Austrian Peace Council has written to Austrian Chancellor Raab, requesting the Austrian government to support the proposal for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The letter to Raab stated: The International Committee of the World Peace Congress has written to governments of all countries, requesting them to take necessary steps to promote the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. Although the Austrian government has received such a letter, it has not taken any steps. The Austrian Peace Council, like the World Peace Congress, firmly believes that the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact would be a guarantee of maintaining world peace. More than 800,000 people in Austria have signed the declaration of the World Peace Council calling for the Five Powers to conclude a peace pact. The Austrian Peace Council hopes that the Austrian government will support the recommendations of the International Committee of the World Peace Congress.

    At the same time, the Austrian Peace Council is taking measures to vigorously launch a movement of people demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The Austrian Peace Council will hold a "Peace Week" from June 8th to 14th, to explain to all Austrian people that peace can be maintained if the major powers reach an understanding and conclude a peace pact. In an appeal to the people issued for the "Peace Week," the Austrian Peace Council called on all friends of peace to conduct a propaganda campaign during the "Peace Week." The appeal also stated,

    The "Peace Week" should play a promoting role for the peace movement in Austria, for the establishment of new peace committees, and for the consolidation of existing peace committees.

    奥地利和平理事会支持缔结五大国和平公约
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利和平理事会写信给奥地利政府总理拉布，要求奥地利政府支持要求缔结五大国和平公约的建议。给拉布的信中说：世界人民和平大会国际委员会曾写信要求世界各国政府采取必要步骤，来促使五大国缔结和平公约。奥地利政府虽然已收到这样的信，但它却并没有采取任何步骤。奥地利和平理事会和世界人民和平大会一样深信，缔结五大国和平公约将是维护世界和平的保证。奥地利已有八十万以上人民在世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名。奥地利和平理事会期望奥地利政府支持世界人民和平大会国际委员会的建议。
    同时，奥地利和平理事会正在采取措施，大力展开人民要求缔结五大国和平公约的运动。奥地利和平理事会将在六月八日到十四日举行“和平周”，向全奥地利人民解释，如果大国间获得谅解并缔结和平公约，和平就可以维护。奥地利和平理事会在为举行“和平周”而发表的告人民书中，号召所有和平的朋友在“和平周”中进行宣传运动。告人民书中并说，
    “和平周”对于奥地利的和平运动，对于新的和平委员会的建立和原有的和平委员会的巩固，要起推动的作用。
