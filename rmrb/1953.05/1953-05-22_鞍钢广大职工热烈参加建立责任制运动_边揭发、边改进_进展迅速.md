Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 21st: The basic construction departments of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company have launched a mass movement against waste, against lack of responsibility, and for the establishment of a responsibility system. To date, the broad workforce of the various construction companies, construction sites, and relevant departments under the Iron and Steel Company have exposed many serious instances of waste and lack of responsibility in their units' work and have put forward many suggestions for overcoming waste and establishing responsibility systems.

    In carrying out this movement, the basic construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have firmly grasped the principle of "simultaneous exposure and improvement." The workers and staff regard exposing shortcomings and improving work as being related like "flowering" and "fruiting." Now, on the propaganda sheds, blackboards, or wall newspapers of each unit, new exposures of problems and valuable suggestions are posted every day. After exposing more than a thousand instances of waste and lack of responsibility, the workers and staff of the steel reinforcement and wooden formwork team at the large rolling mill construction site have classified and analyzed them and have initially solved the main and solvable problems. For example, after the team exposed instances of waste or impact on project quality due to rusting of steel reinforcement, the workers and staff quickly built rain shelters for storing steel reinforcement and established strict storage, requisition, issuance, and recycling systems. The backbone training class of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company also mobilized team and group leaders and workers to discuss improvement methods separately based on the problems exposed, and finally established a team and group leader responsibility system and formulated a small group pact to ensure good, fast, economical, and safe completion of tasks. At present, the various basic construction departments under the Iron and Steel Company are guiding this movement to proceed according to clear goals and are gradually establishing basic responsibility systems for administration, planning, technical supply, financial management, quality, and implementation of Soviet expert recommendations.

    The movement against waste, against lack of responsibility, and for the establishment of a responsibility system in the basic construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is progressing very rapidly. This is mainly because the leading cadres of each unit, through studying the instructions of higher authorities and their own work experiences, have clearly recognized that carrying out this movement is the best way to improve enterprise management, comprehensively complete tasks, and raise the awareness of workers and staff. Therefore, before carrying out this movement, they repeatedly studied the situation of their units and mobilized the relevant personnel separately. The main responsible cadres of the Iron and Steel Company also made mobilization reports to more than 10,000 technicians and administrative personnel. At the same time, the relevant leading departments also ran 29 training classes, training more than 3,000 team leaders, group leaders, technicians, and clerks, enabling them to have a correct understanding of the significance and methods of carrying out this movement. Therefore, they have played a significant role in mobilizing the masses.

    鞍钢广大职工热烈参加建立责任制运动
    “边揭发、边改进”进展迅速
    【新华社鞍山二十一日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门展开了群众性的反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动。到目前为止，钢铁公司所属各工程公司、工地和各有关部门的广大职工，已揭发出本单位工作中许多严重的浪费和无人负责的事实，并提出了许多克服浪费现象和建立责任制度的建议。
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门在开展这一运动中，紧紧地掌握了“边揭发、边改进”的方针，职工们都把揭发不良现象和改进工作看作是“开花”和“结果”的关系。现在，在各单位的鼓动棚、黑板报或壁报上，每天都贴满了新揭发的问题和宝贵的建议。大型轧钢厂工地的钢筋木模队的职工，在揭发出一千多件浪费和无人负责的事实后，已作了归类分析，把主要的和能够解决的问题都初步地解决了。如该队揭发出由于钢筋生锈而造成浪费或影响工程质量的情况后，职工们很快就搭起了储备钢筋的防雨棚，建立了严格的保管、领发和回收等制度。轧钢工程公司骨干分子训练班也根据揭发出的问题，发动班、组长和工人分别讨论改进的办法，最后建立了班、组长责任制，订立了保证好、快、省和安全完成任务的小组公约。目前，钢铁公司所属各基本建设部门，正在引导这个运动按着明确的目标进行，逐步地建立起行政、计划、技术供应、财务管理、质量和贯彻苏联专家建议等基本的责任制度。
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门开展的反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动，进展十分迅速。这主要是由于各单位的领导干部，从学习上级的指示和自己的工作体会中，明确认识了开展这一运动是改进企业管理、全面完成任务和提高职工觉悟的最好方法。因此，他们在开展这一运动前，都反复地研究了本单位的情况，分别向有关的人员作了动员。钢铁公司的主要负责干部，也曾向一万多个技术人员和行政管理人员作了动员报告。同时，有关的领导部门还开办了二十九个训练班，训练了三千多个班长、组长、技术人员和职员，使他们对开展这一运动的意义和作法有了正确的认识。因此他们在发动群众的工作中起了很大作用。
