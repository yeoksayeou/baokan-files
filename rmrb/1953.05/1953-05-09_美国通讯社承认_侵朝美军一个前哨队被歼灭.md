    U.S. News Agency Admits:
    An American Outpost Annihilated During the Korean War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The Associated Press reported from Seoul on the 6th that an American Marine outpost was almost completely wiped out in a recent battle. Of this outpost, which consisted of thirty-one men, fourteen were killed, and most of the remainder were wounded, with only three unwounded. One U.S. Marine said: "This is an unusually high casualty rate, but it makes you understand what kind of war we are fighting." He said: This is a "war of attrition." This American soldier was described by the Associated Press reporter as "stubborn," but when talking about his feelings about the current war, he revealed that, like countless American soldiers, he was war-weary and afraid of death. He spoke of the power of the artillery of the Korean and Chinese People's Army, and talked about his own feelings, saying that he was "nervous" to a terrifying degree, "You often wonder why you run outside to die."

    美国通讯社承认
    侵朝美军一个前哨队被歼灭
    【新华社八日讯】美联社汉城六日电透露，美国海军陆战队的一支前哨队在最近的一次战斗中，几乎全部被歼灭。这支共有三十一个人的前哨队，被击毙十四个人，其余大部分受伤，没有受伤的仅有三个人。一个美国海军陆战队队员说：“这是出乎寻常的重大伤亡，但是，这使你明了我们是在打怎样的仗。”他说：这就是“消耗战”。这个美国兵被美联社记者称为“倔强的”，但是，在谈到对目前这种战争的感想时，却显出他就像无数美国士兵一样，是厌战怕死。他谈论着朝中人民军队大炮的威力，并谈到他自己的心情说：“神经紧张”得可怕，“你时常会怀疑，为什么跑到外面去送死。”
