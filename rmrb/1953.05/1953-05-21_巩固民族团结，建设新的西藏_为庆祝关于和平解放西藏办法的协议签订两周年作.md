    Consolidate National Unity and Build a New Tibet
    – In Celebration of the Second Anniversary of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
    Zhang Jingwu
    Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the friendly and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in China, the ethnic relations in our country have undergone fundamental changes, transforming from an era of national oppression to an era of national equality. The Tibetan nationality, one of the ancient and outstanding ethnic groups in the motherland, has been peacefully liberated and returned to the big family of the motherland for two years. Over the past two years, the Tibetan people have enjoyed national equality, freedom of religious belief, and all other rights they are entitled to, and are gradually realizing a peaceful and happy life. This is a victory for the national policy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and also a victory for the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people. On the occasion of celebrating the second anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, a review of our work in implementing the agreement shows that we have already achieved some major accomplishments. These mainly include: the growth of patriotism among the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people; the People's Liberation Army reaching the front lines of national defense, safeguarding the border of the motherland, thereby safeguarding the interests and security of the Tibetan nationality, and receiving active support from the Tibetan people; the smooth return of the Panchen Erdeni to Tibet, the close unity between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, marking the unprecedented unity within the Tibetan nationality, ending the state of division historically created by imperialism and the reactionary ruling class of China; the Tibetan region has successively sent delegations and visiting groups to Beijing to pay respects to Chairman Mao, and sent representatives to attend various conferences in the motherland. All delegations, visiting groups, and representatives have happily visited various economic and cultural constructions of the motherland, visited various cultural relics, temples, historical sites, and scenic areas, thereby further recognizing the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, harmonizing national feelings, and enhancing the unity with the fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland; the Central People's Government promulgated the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China in August 1952. We have every reason to believe that the realization of national regional autonomy will further enhance and consolidate the close unity between the Tibetan nationality and the fraternal ethnic groups in the country.
    Over the past two years, the People's Liberation Army in Tibet has faithfully implemented the agreement, actively engaged in land reclamation and production, constructed transportation, established banks and trade companies, purchased and sold wool, the largest source of income for the Tibetan people, at reasonable prices, implemented fair trade, issued agricultural and pastoral loans, established agricultural and pastoral training classes, trained agricultural and pastoral technical cadres, supported people's production, and taken various effective measures to gradually restore and support the development of Tibet's agricultural, pastoral, industrial, and commercial sectors, and to improve and raise the material life of the Tibetan people, making a good start. The People's Liberation Army and staff working in Tibet have carried out extensive propaganda work in the Tibetan region, publicizing the various policies of the Central People's Government and the spirit of the agreement, helping the Tibetan nationality establish primary schools, cultivating a new generation of Tibetans, helping Tibetan youth organize patriotic youth cultural associations and learning organizations, convened various conferences or symposiums to commemorate festivals, published Tibetan news briefs, introduced major events at home and abroad, screened patriotic films and performed dramas, providing the broad masses of Tibetan people with many learning opportunities and gaining much progressive knowledge. The leadership attaches special importance to cultivating Tibetan cadres who have joined the army or government organs, thereby improving their cultural, political, and work abilities, and they will become good staff members who loyally serve the people of their own nationality. People's hospitals or clinics have been established in major towns in the Tibetan region, greatly alleviating the suffering of the people from diseases; preparations are underway for a serum factory and the establishment of a veterinary epidemic training class, bringing bright hopes for the protection and development of animal husbandry for the Tibetan people. All the above-mentioned concrete facts are all for the benefit of the Tibetan nationality everywhere, setting a good example in improving the material and cultural life of the Tibetan people, thereby enhancing national feelings and friendship, enhancing mutual respect and trust, and bringing a bright and happy future to the Tibetan people.
    The acquisition of the above-mentioned major achievements is due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the good unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, the faithful implementation of the peaceful agreement by the People's Liberation Army and staff in Tibet, and the increasing patriotism of the broad masses of Tibetan monks and laypeople and their active support for the People's Liberation Army in Tibet.
    The large-scale economic construction cause that the motherland is undertaking is conducive to the development of the political, economic, and cultural and educational construction cause of the Tibetan nationality. Building a new Tibet is our long-term, arduous, and glorious task. We must not slack off, be complacent, arrogant, or impatient. We should further consolidate national unity on the basis of the achievements already made, continue to work hard, and strive to gradually and fully implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. Because the common enemy of all ethnic groups – the Kuomintang reactionaries – has been overthrown, national oppression has been abolished, and after the signing of the peaceful agreement, our task is no longer to help the Tibetan nationality strive for liberation from national oppression, but to earnestly help the Tibetan nationality develop politically, economically, and culturally, and improve the material and cultural life of the Tibetan nationality in accordance with the spirit of the agreement. In order to accomplish this glorious task, the Tibetan and Han nationalities must consolidate and strengthen national unity, wholeheartedly support and implement the great policy of national equality and freedom of religious belief of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, further strengthen the education that combines patriotism and internationalism, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, enhance political vigilance, strictly guard against various provocations and sabotage by imperialism and its pawns, oppose great-nation chauvinism and narrow nationalism, oppose national discrimination, promote the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation, enhance national feelings and friendship, enhance mutual respect and trust, resolutely unite in the big family of friendly cooperation of all ethnic groups in the motherland, under the leadership of the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the close unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and closely unite with the People's Liberation Army in Tibet to advance hand in hand, work together, consolidate national defense, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, we will surely achieve complete victory!
    Long live the People's Republic of China – the big family of friendly cooperation of all ethnic groups! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China!

    巩固民族团结，建设新的西藏
    ——为庆祝关于和平解放西藏办法的协议签订两周年作
    张经武
    自从中国各族人民友好合作的大家庭——中华人民共和国宣告成立之日起，我国民族关系有了根本的改变，从民族压迫时代改变为民族平等的时代。祖国境内具有悠久历史和优秀民族之一的西藏民族，获得和平解放，回到祖国大家庭中已经两年了。两年来，西藏民族享受着民族平等、宗教信仰自由及其他应享的一切权利，逐步地实现着和平愉快的幸福生活，这是中国共产党、中央人民政府和各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的民族政策的胜利，也是西藏民族和西藏人民的胜利。在庆祝和平解放西藏办法的协议签订两周年的日子，回顾一下我们执行协议的工作，就可以看到我们业已获得的一些重大成就。主要是：西藏民族和西藏人民爱国主义的增长；人民解放军到达国防的前线，保卫着祖国的边疆，从而保卫着西藏民族的利益和安全，他们得到了西藏人民的积极支援；班禅额尔德尼顺利地返回西藏，达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼亲密团结，标志着西藏民族内部的空前团结，结束了历史上为帝国主义及中国反动统治阶级所造成的分裂状态；西藏地区曾先后派出了致敬团、参观团到北京向毛主席致敬，派遣代表出席祖国各种会议，所有致敬团、参观团和代表们，曾经愉快地参观过祖国的各种经济建设和文化建设，参观过各种文物、寺庙、古迹与风景幽美的地区，从而进一步地认识了祖国的伟大与可爱，融洽了民族感情，增强了与祖国各兄弟民族间的团结；中央人民政府于一九五二年八月公布了中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要，我们完全有理由相信，民族区域自治的实现，必将更进一步增强和巩固西藏民族与国内各兄弟民族的紧密团结。
    两年来，进藏人民解放军忠实地执行协议，积极开荒生产，修筑交通，开办银行、贸易公司，以合理价格收购和推销西藏人民最大收入的羊毛，实行买卖公平，发放农牧贷款，开办农牧训练班，训练农牧技术干部，扶助人民生产，以及采取各种有效措施，为逐步恢复和扶持西藏农牧工商业的发展，为改善和提高西藏人民的物质生活，做了良好的开端。进藏人民解放军和工作人员，在西藏地区进行了广泛的宣传工作，宣传了中央人民政府的各种政策和协议精神，帮助西藏民族创办小学，培养藏族新生的一代，帮助藏族青年组织了爱国青年文化联谊会的学习组织，召开了各种纪念节日的大会或座谈会，出刊了藏文新闻简讯，介绍国内外大事，放映爱国电影和演出戏剧，使广大藏族人民得到许多学习的机会，获得了许多进步的知识。已经参加军队或机关工作的藏族干部，领导上特别重视培养，因而提高了他们的文化、政治水平和工作能力，且将成为本民族人民忠诚服务的很好的工作人员。西藏地区各主要城镇设立了人民医院或门诊所，大大减轻了人民疾病的痛苦；筹办血清厂，开办兽疫训练班，为藏族人民保护与发展畜牧业带来光明的希望。所有上述这些具体的事实，无不处处为西藏民族利益着想，在提高西藏人民的物质生活和文化生活方面，树立了良好的榜样，从而增强了民族感情和友谊，增强了互相尊重和信任，给西藏人民带来了光明幸福的前途。
    上述这些重大成就的获得，是由于毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导，是与达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和好团结，进藏人民解放军和工作人员忠实执行和平协议以及西藏广大僧俗人民爱国主义日益增长和积极支援进藏人民解放军分不开的。
    祖国正在进行的大规模经济建设事业，有利于发展西藏民族的政治、经济和文化教育的建设事业，建设新西藏是我们长期的艰巨的光荣任务，我们决不松懈、自满、骄傲和急躁，应在既得的成就的基础上，进一步的巩固民族团结，继续努力工作，争取逐步全部实现关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。因为各民族的共同敌人——国民党反动派已被打倒，民族压迫业已废除，和平协议签订之后，我们的任务已经不是要帮助西藏民族从民族压迫下争取解放，而是要根据协议的精神，认真地帮助西藏民族发展政治、经济和文化，提高西藏民族的物质生活和文化生活。为了完成这一光荣任务，藏汉两大民族必须巩固和加强民族团结，衷心地拥护和执行中央人民政府毛主席的伟大的民族平等政策和宗教信仰自由的政策，进一步加强爱国主义与国际主义相结合的教育，分清敌我界线，提高政治警惕，严防帝国主义及其爪牙的各种挑拨离间，反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义，反对民族歧视，发扬团结互助、友爱合作的精神，增强民族感情和友谊，增强互相尊重和信任，坚决地团结在祖国各民族友爱合作的大家庭中，在各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，在达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼亲密团结的领导下，和进藏人民解放军亲密团结携手并进，共同努力，巩固祖国国防，建设繁荣、幸福的新西藏，一定能够获得完满的胜利！
    中华人民共和国——各族人民友好合作的大家庭万岁！中国各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
