Reader's Letters Abstract

The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Should Immediately Find Ways to Solve the Problem of Not Being Able to Subscribe to Newspapers

Editor's Note: We continue to receive letters from readers about not being able to subscribe to newspapers and magazines. Below, we have selected just a few letters, which reveal significant shortcomings in how many post offices handle this work. We hope that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will immediately find ways to supervise and help local post offices overcome these shortcomings and solve the problem of readers not being able to subscribe to newspapers.

(I)

Ye Jihuai from the Water and Heating Plant of the Electromechanical Department of the Hegang Mining Bureau writes: Newspapers are distributed by the post office so that people can get newspapers according to their needs; but the situation in Hegang is getting worse and worse, and most people who subscribe to the People's Daily are not getting it. It seems that the fight against bureaucracy and commandism in the postal and telecommunications departments has had little effect. When asked, they say, "Private individuals are not allowed to subscribe to the People's Daily." When told that the subscription fee has already been paid, they reply, "We'll refund the subscription fee to you." As for myself, I have been subscribing to the People's Daily for more than two years without interruption. I cannot do without the People's Daily every day; at the same time, my copy of the newspaper is also a major reference material for many workers in our factory. Many of the current policy and current affairs study documents are People's Daily editorials, and it is very inconvenient without the People's Daily. I paid the March subscription fee to the post office on February 6th, and the post office should deliver the newspaper to me. I think similar situations may exist in other small cities in Northeast China. I ask the People's Daily to pay attention to this issue and reverse this unreasonable phenomenon. If there is really no way, I request to subscribe to the newspaper directly from your newspaper office. If the post office does not deliver the newspaper, can I sue them in the judicial organs?

(II)

Su Zhixing from Northeast Transportation Company writes: Since the postal and telecommunications system has paid attention to correcting the style of forced orders, a new kind of deviation has now emerged. Many readers are not getting their cultural nourishment, and post offices are refusing subscriptions under the pretext of "planned distribution." Every day, many subscribers inquire about subscribing to newspapers and magazines at the newspaper and magazine subscription office of the Shenyang Post Office, but according to comrades at the post office, only the Guangming Daily has not reached its quota; all other newspapers and magazines have. A long-term subscriber whose subscription has just expired—a comrade from an engineering college—repeatedly asked to leave the money at the post office and have them send the newspaper to him when it was available, but he was also refused with the stern words "The higher authorities have allocated the numbers, and there is no way." I am a long-term reader of the People's Daily, and I often think about subscribing to my own copy when my financial situation allows. Since January 1953, I have been asking the post office how to subscribe to the newspaper, but I have been refused for the same reason. I am very disappointed. Who can subscribe to the People's Daily? Is this the policy of the state? Is the determination of the number of newspapers distributed based on the needs of the people, or is it based on the decision of the higher authorities? What is the basis of the decision of the higher authorities? I think this practice of forcibly stopping subscriptions and refusing subscriptions is unreasonable.

(III)

The joint office of the Construction School Committee of the Third Institute of the Second Engineering Company of Central South China writes on April 20th: We are a new institution that was only officially established in early April, so we were unable to subscribe to the April newspapers in March. The comrades' demand for reading newspapers is very urgent. In order to subscribe to your newspaper, we have negotiated with the Luojiashan Post Office and the Wuchang Post Office many times, but to no avail. The comrades are very dissatisfied. We are telling you the situation in detail, hoping that the relevant parties will improve it.

On the second day of the establishment of our institution—April 2nd—in the morning, Comrade Qiu Yashan requested to subscribe to eight kinds of newspapers, including the People's Daily, from the Luojiashan Post Office. The post office replied: "The subscription period for the April newspapers has passed, and there is no way to subscribe retroactively. You can only subscribe to the next month's newspapers before the 20th." So we called and wrote to the Wuchang Post Office asking them to find a way to subscribe retroactively from April 4th. But the post office returned the original letter with the note: "You can only subscribe to the May newspapers. We will issue a receipt and collect the payment after the decision is made." Therefore, we have been waiting for the post office's decision to issue a receipt and collect the payment. We had not seen them come to collect the payment until April 16th, so we had no choice but to write to the Luojiashan Post Office again requesting them to urgently handle the subscription procedures for the May newspapers. Who knew that the post office would say again: "The subscription time for foreign newspapers for May has passed." When we negotiated with the Wuchang Post Office again on the 18th, they said: "The foreign newspapers for May could only be subscribed before April 15th. If you had come on the morning of the 16th, we could have found a way, but it is not possible today." In fact, we had negotiated with the Luojiashan Post Office on the 16th.

What we need now is not for them to examine themselves, but to see the newspapers. We are sending this letter to you, hoping that your newspaper office will subscribe to six copies of your newspaper from May 1st (Note: We have asked the Beijing Post Office to send newspapers to the readers).

(IV)

A comrade from the library of the Henan Military and Political Cadre School writes: I went to the Kaifeng Post Office to subscribe to newspapers at 10:00 AM on April 21st, only to find out that the subscription period had passed. This was terrible, and I was so anxious that my face turned red. I rushed to the distribution group of the post office to request a subscription, and they replied: "You could still subscribe to the People's Daily yesterday, but not today." How can we see the newspapers if they distribute them like this?

As luck would have it, at this time, a note from the Henan Public Security Command to stop subscribing to the People's Daily was delivered. I immediately asked to subscribe to these discontinued newspapers, but the post office refused on the grounds that "discontinuing subscriptions is not allowed." Later, under my strong request, they seemed to agree to subscribe to one copy each of the People's Daily and the China Youth Daily, and asked me if I had cash on hand. This made me overjoyed and I ran to the subscription office, but who knew that they would not subscribe to them after all, wasting two or three hours of my time. I think the post office should not be so mechanical, and even less should they completely disregard the pain and impact of readers not seeing the newspaper for the whole month. I am now sending 18,000 yuan for the subscription fee (Note: We have handed this payment to the Beijing Post Office, which will send newspapers to the readers), please find a way to subscribe to one copy of the May People's Daily. This is naturally not in accordance with the procedures, but it is an unorthodox method in a situation where there is no other way.

(V)

Li Xingxu and four other people from the Tenth Bachelor Apartment of the Qiqihar Railway Administration write: We are sending you the subscription fee in a situation where we have no other choice (Note: We have handed this payment to the Beijing Post Office, which will send newspapers to the readers), and we ask you to find a way to subscribe to the May newspaper. The course of events is as follows:

Five of us in the same dormitory have been jointly subscribing to a copy of the People's Daily since April 1952 in order to study policies and current affairs, and we have not interrupted it for twelve months. However, there have been many twists and turns in the middle: at first, we paid the subscription fee at the post office at the train station, and later we changed to paying the fee at the Qiqihar City General Post Office (seven or eight *li* from our dormitory). The post office stipulates that the 15th to the 18th is the period for prepaying the next month's subscription fee (the office is closed every Sunday), and it is troublesome if you miss the 18th. They always have reasons to refuse to subscribe, such as "the time has passed" or "it must be distributed according to the plan." We have to plead repeatedly before they allow us to subscribe to the newspaper. This month we were busy with work and missed the subscription period again. The 19th was Sunday, and we went to pay the fee without sleeping after our night shift on the 20th. Who knew that the distributor at the post office would refuse to accept the payment?

Editor Comrade: We are readers of the People's Daily who have not interrupted it for twelve months, and we are not willing to violate the rigid rules and regulations of the post office for distributing newspapers. It is really because time does not allow it, and we can only go to the post office to complete the payment procedures on Sundays or days off. We now provide a few suggestions for your reference:

(1) All post office branches should handle newspaper subscription fee procedures to provide readers with the convenience of paying fees monthly. (2) The newspaper delivery comrades should take the initiative to collect the subscription fees from long-term subscribers who pay monthly. (3) The post office should also accept subscription fees on Sundays.

(VI)

The People's Bank of Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, writes: We saw in your newspaper announcement that the quota of the People's Daily can still meet the needs of readers; but the post office in our area said that the allocation quota is full. We told the post office that we needed to increase the subscription to one copy of the People's Daily on April 20th, but the post office delayed and only said that they would collect the payment later. They did not notify us to pay until the 25th. When we sent the check, it was already 6:00 PM, and they had just gotten off work and would not accept it. It was not possible to send it the next day either. It seems that if you pay early, they delay, and if you pay a little late, they do not accept it, which really cannot meet the needs of readers. We are sending a remittance to subscribe to one copy of your newspaper, to be sent by airmail from May 1st. (Note: The payment has been handed over to the Beijing Post Office, which will send newspapers to the readers)

(VII)

Miao Sheng from the Xidan District People's Government in Beijing writes: I am a long-term subscriber to the Party newspaper, and I have a very deep feeling for the Party newspaper. It has become the most important spiritual food for me every day.

At the end of April, I ran out of money and could not pay the May subscription fee on time. I was very anxious. Therefore, five days before "May Day," I wrote an application requesting a postponement of the payment, but I did not get the consent of the comrades at the post office (the comrade who delivers the newspaper is surnamed Song). The day after I wrote the application (i.e., April 27th), I received the money and immediately sent the subscription fee to the reception room to be forwarded to the comrade surnamed Song, but I still could not subscribe. Now I have to buy individual newspapers every day this month. I don't think the Party newspaper will enforce the system so mechanically in its distribution work. I hope you will improve.

The People's Court of Huize County Seriously Handles Marriage Issues of Revolutionary Soldiers

Chen Dechao writes: He Zhiying, a woman from Anagu Village, Huize County, Yunnan Province, had a very good relationship with Yang Kaichang from the same village for several years after they got married. In 1950, Yang Kaichang joined the Volunteer Army. Later, because He Zhiying did not get along well with her parents-in-law, her parents-in-law wrote a letter to Yang Kaichang, who was on the front line in Korea, saying that she was "disobedient," etc. Yang Kaichang was very angry after reading his parents' letter, so he wrote a letter to He Zhiying in the winter of 1950 saying that he wanted a divorce. He Zhiying's relationship with her parents-in-law deteriorated, and she felt that she could not get along with them. Last spring, she took Yang Kaichang's letter to the county people's court to request a divorce. The county people's court repeatedly verified that the letter from Korea was indeed genuine, but also learned that she and her husband had a very good relationship before, and that the man had joined the Volunteer Army. For the sake of prudence, the county people's court sent a letter to the political department of Yang Kaichang's unit in Korea last March, asking for help to understand Yang Kaichang's situation. Later, the political department of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army replied to the county people's court and attached Yang Kaichang's letter. Yang Kaichang wrote in his letter: "I am fighting the American devils on the front line in Korea to defend the motherland and defend peace. Now I have not been sacrificed, but wounded. She (He Zhiying) is asking for a divorce. If it is okay to divorce, I have no objection; if it does not meet the conditions for divorce, I hope you can educate and persuade her well so that she can produce well." The meaning was very clear that Yang Kaichang did not want a divorce. The county people's court notified He Zhiying to come to the county and read Yang Kaichang's letter to her. After reading it, without waiting for an explanation, He Zhiying resolutely said: "I have feelings for him at all, it's just that he read the letter from his parents-in-law and didn't understand the real situation, so he wrote a letter asking for a divorce from me. Now he has written a letter saying that he doesn't want to divorce me, do I still want to break away from him? I hope he will kill more enemies at the front and write to me more often when he has free time. I am determined to produce well in the rear and support them! I am determined to strive to be a model on the production front, and when he comes back, he and I will both wear big red flowers." The cadres of the county people's court then encouraged He Zhiying and also educated her and her parents-in-law on harmonious production, supporting the Volunteer Army, and striving to become a model family of military dependents. Sure enough, the situation of disharmony in Yang Kaichang's family changed.

The People's Court of Huize County is worthy of praise for handling the marriage issues of active revolutionary soldiers in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law in a serious and responsible manner.

### 读者来信摘要

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    邮电部应立即设法解决订不到报纸的问题
    编者按：读者对于订不到报刊的信件仍然不断寄来，下面我们只选登几封来信，就可以看出不少邮局在处理这一工作上存在着严重缺点。希望邮电部立即设法督促和帮助各地邮局克服这些缺点，解决读者订不到报纸的问题。
    （一）
    鹤岗矿务局机电处水暖厂叶季怀来信：报纸交给邮局发行，为的是使人民能按照需要得到报纸；但是鹤岗这个地方却愈搞愈糟，大多数人订的人民日报都不给送了。邮电部门反官僚主义反命令主义好像没有什么效果，问到他们就说：“私人一概不订人民日报”。和他们说，报费早已交了，他们回答：“退报费给你”。以我来说，订人民日报已有两年多，从未间断，我自己每天离不开人民日报；同时我这一份报纸也是本厂很多职工学习的主要参考材料。目前的政策时事学习的文件有很多是人民日报的社论，没有人民日报非常不便。三月份报费，我在二月六日就交给邮局了，邮局应该送报给我。我想类似情况，东北其他小城市可能也有，我要求人民日报重视这个问题，扭转这个不合理的现象。实在无法的话，我请求直接向你社订阅报纸。邮局不送报，我是否可向司法机关控诉他们。
    （二）
    东北运输公司苏志兴来信：自从邮电系统注意纠正强迫命令作风以后，现在又出现了新的另一种偏向，许多读者得不到文化食粮的供给，邮局借口“计划发行”而拒绝订购。沈阳市邮局报刊订阅处每天都有很多订户打听订购报纸杂志，但据邮局同志说，只有光明日报没有满额，其余任何报刊都没有。刚刚满期的长期订户——一个工学院的同志一再要求把钱放在邮局，等有报时再寄给他；但也在“上级分配数字，没有办法”的严词之下遭到拒绝。我是人民日报的长期读者，常想着在经济情况允许的时候自己订一份比较方便。自一九五三年一月起就到邮局打听怎样订报？也是以同一理由而被拒绝，我很感到失望。人民日报是什么人可以订到呢？国家是这样的政策吗？报纸发行数的确定是根据人民需要呢，还是根据上级决定呢？上级决定又是根据什么呢？我认为这种强迫停止订购，拒绝订阅的做法是没有道理的。
    （三）
    中南第二工程公司三院建校委员会联合办事处四月二十日来信：我们是四月初才正式成立的一个新机构，因此四月份的报纸未能在三月份预订好。而同志们的读报要求又很迫切，我们为了订阅你报，曾多次向珞珈山邮局和武昌邮局交涉，都无结果，同志们深感不满。特将经过情形告诉你们，望转有关方面改进。
    当我们机构成立的第二天——四月二日——上午即由丘亚山同志向珞珈山邮局请求订阅人民日报等八种报纸，该局答复：“四月份报纸的订期已过，没法补订了，只能于二十日前订下月份的报。”我们就又打电话和写信到武昌邮局请求设法自四月四日起补订。但该局将原信批回称：“只能订五月份的，决定后再开收据收款。”因此我们一直在等候着该局的决定，开收据来收款。直到四月十六日尚未见来收款，我们不得已才又写信给珞珈山邮局请求急办五月份报纸的订阅手续，谁知该局又说：“五月份的外埠报纸订阅时间过了。”我们十八日又向武昌邮局交涉时，他们却说：“五月份的外埠报纸，本来只能在四月十五日前订购，你们在十六日上午来还可再想办法，但今天就不行了。”其实我们正是十六日和珞珈山邮局交涉过的。
    我们现在需要的并不是要他们如何检讨，而是需要报纸看，特函达，希望你社从五月一日起订给你报六份（按：我们已请北京邮局给读者发报）。
   （四）
    河南军政干部学校图书馆一同志来信：我于四月二十一日上午十时到开封邮局订报，才知订期已过。这可糟了，急得我满脸通红。又急忙跑到该局发行组要求订阅，他们回答：“昨天订人民日报还可以，今天不行了。”像这样的发行报纸，我们怎能看到报呢？
    说也凑巧，正在这时，河南公安司令部停订人民日报的字条送来了，我当即要求将这些停订的报纸订给我们，但却被邮局以“不准停订”的理由拒绝了。后来在我极力要求下，似乎答应订给人民日报和中国青年报各一份，并问我是否有现钞。这使我喜出望外地跑到订报处去，谁知他们又不订给了，白费了我两三个钟头。我认为邮局不应这样机械，更不应该完全不考虑到读者整月看不到报纸的痛苦和影响。现寄上报费一万八千元（按：此款我们已交北京邮局，由他们给读者发报），请设法订五月份人民日报一份，这自然是不符合手续的，但这是在没有办法中的不合手续的办法。
   （五）
    齐齐哈尔铁路管理局第十独身寓所李行序等五人来信：我们在万不得已的情况下才把报费寄给你们（按：此款我们已交北京邮局，由他们给读者发报），麻烦你们设法给订五月份的报。事情经过是这样的：
    我们同寝室五个人，为了学习政策和时事，自一九五二年四月份起就共同订了一份人民日报，至今有十二个月没有间断过。可是中间的曲折是很多的：起初是在车站邮局交报费，后又改在齐齐哈尔市总邮局（距我们宿舍七八华里）交款，邮局规定十五日至十八日为预交下月报费期（每逢星期日不办公），要是错过了十八日就麻烦了。不是“时间已过”就是“要按计划发行”，总是有理由拒绝订报。要再三求情才准许我们订报。这个月我们因事忙又错过了订期，十九日又是星期日，二十日我们夜班下来没有睡觉就去交款，谁知邮局的发行者竟拒绝收款了。
    编辑同志：我们是十二个月没有间断的人民日报读者，我们也不甘愿犯邮局规定发行报纸的死板条规，实在是时间不容许，只有星期或休班日才能到邮局去办理缴款手续。现提供几点意见供参考：
    （一）凡邮局支局应办收报费手续，给读者按月缴费的便利。（二）按月交报费的长期订户应由送报同志主动收款。（三）邮局礼拜日也应接收报费。
   （六）
    四川綦江县人民银行来信：见你报启事说，人民日报定额还可以满足读者需要；但我地邮局说配额已满。我们四月二十日即告诉邮局需要增订一份“人民日报”，但邮局迟迟拖延，只说以后收款，到二十五日才通知我们交款，我们把支票交去时已六点钟，他们刚下班就不收了。第二天交去也不行。似此早交则拖延，迟交一点又不收，实在不能满足读者需要。特汇款订你报一份，自五月一日起航空寄送。（按：款已交北京邮局，由他们给读者发报）
   （七）
    北京市西单区人民政府苗生来信：我是党报的长期订户，我对党报已有极深厚的感情，它已成了我每日最重要的精神食粮。
    在四月底我的钱已用完了，不能按月缴纳五月份的报费，我很焦急。因此我在“五一”节前五天写了一个申请书，要求延期缴费，但没有获得邮局同志的同意。（送报的同志姓宋）当我写了申请书的第二天（即四月二十七日）领到了钱，马上就把报费送收发室转交姓宋的，但依然不能订阅。现在我这月只好每天买零报看。我想党报在发行工作上是不会这样机械执行制度的。希望你们改进。
    会泽县人民法院严肃处理革命军人婚姻问题
    陈德超来信：云南省会泽县阿那谷村妇女何治英和同村杨开昌结婚后好几年，感情一向很好。一九五○年，杨开昌参加了志愿军。以后，由于何治英和她公婆不和睦，她公婆就写信给在朝鲜前线的杨开昌，说她“不孝顺”等等。杨开昌看了父母的信后很气愤，遂于一九五○年冬来信给何治英说要离婚。何治英和公婆的关系日趋恶劣，感到不能相处，即于去年春带着杨开昌的来信到该县人民法院请求离婚。县人民法院反复验证，肯定那封朝鲜来的信的确是真的，但又了解到以前她夫妻情感很好，且男方又参加了志愿军。县人民法院为了慎重起见，于去年三月去信朝鲜给杨开昌所属部队的政治部，请帮助了解杨开昌的情况。后来，志愿军某部政治部给县人民法院回了信，并附来杨开昌的信。杨开昌信中写道：“我为了保卫祖国、保卫和平，在朝鲜前线和美国鬼子作战。现在我未曾牺牲，受伤。她（何治英）提出离婚，如果可以离，我没有意见；如果不合乎离婚条件，我希望你们能很好地教育、说服她，使她好好生产。”意思很明显，杨开昌不愿意离婚。县人民法院通知何治英到县里，把杨开昌的信念给她听，念完后，还不待解释，何治英毅然说：“我和他根本是有感情的，只是他看了公婆去的信，不了解真实情况，才来信要和我离婚。现在他又来信说不愿和我离婚，我还想和他脱离吗？我希望他在前方多杀敌人，有空闲多写信给我。我在后方决定好好生产，支援他们！我决心争取在生产战线上当模范，等他回来时，我和他都带上大红花。”县人民法院干部便一方面鼓励何治英，一方面又向她和她公婆进行了和睦生产、支持志愿军、争取做模范军属家庭的教育。果然，杨开昌家不和睦的情况改变了。
    会泽县人民法院遵照着婚姻法的精神、认真严肃地处理现役革命军人婚姻问题，值得表扬。
