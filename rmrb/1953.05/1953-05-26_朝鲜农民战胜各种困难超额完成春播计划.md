Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 22nd: The broad masses of farmers in the northern half of Korea, overcoming the enemy aircraft's frenzied bombing, strafing, and various difficulties, completed 102.2 percent of their sowing plan by April 30th, ten days earlier than last year.

This year's agricultural production conditions have improved compared to previous years. Last year's bumper harvest in the northern half of Korea enabled a greater recovery of the Korean rural economy. Before this year's spring plowing and sowing, farmers mostly added or repaired farm tools, added draught cattle, and carefully selected fine seeds, making full preparations for spring plowing and sowing. However, difficulties still remain numerous. Labor and livestock are still lacking in various places. Enemy aircraft and warships constantly threaten the farmers' cultivation.

The staunch Korean farmers bravely overcame all these difficulties. They rationally organized and adjusted mutual aid teams and labor-animal exchange teams. The broad masses of rural women also participated in agricultural production and took part in guiding the plow. Disregarding the enemy aircraft and warships' frenzied bombing, they filled in the bombed fields, widely adopted advanced production methods, and enthusiastically launched a production increase competition between counties, between villages, and between residential groups. The heroic struggle of the farmers in Munchon County, Kangwon Province, near the sea, is a typical example. They dug shelters in every corner of the fields, camouflaged both people and livestock, and persisted in production under the enemy aircraft and warships' bombardment, and also participated in the production increase competition. In the competition, the elderly and Young Pioneer members also participated in sowing, fertilizer delivery, and other tasks. As a result, they completed the sowing plan for millet, corn, sorghum, potatoes, and other crops on April 16th.

The Korean government and the Korean Workers' Party gave the greatest concern and assistance to the farmers' production increase struggle. Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, met with high-yield farmers in South Pyongan Province and Party and government cadres in rural areas at the beginning of the spring plowing, and gave detailed instructions on all aspects of agricultural production. Since then, a large number of cadres have been sent to various cities and counties to strengthen the guidance and help for spring plowing and sowing work. The state distributed uncultivated land to poor farmers and refugees for cultivation, and the state's Farmers' Bank issued a large number of agricultural loans to farmers.

The farmers have also received enthusiastic help from the Chinese People's Volunteers. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers have not only assisted Korean farmers in reclaiming wasteland, cultivating, fertilizing, and repairing waterways and fields destroyed by enemy aircraft, but some have also used their blacksmith shops to make various farm tools and give them to Korean farmers, and some have also deployed defensive artillery fire around the fields and on the coast to protect Korean farmers in their production.

### 朝鲜农民战胜各种困难超额完成春播计划

    朝鲜农民战胜各种困难超额完成春播计划
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】朝鲜北半部广大农民战胜了敌机的疯狂轰炸扫射和各种困难，已经在四月三十日，比去年提早十天完成了播种计划的百分之一百零二点二。
    今年的农业生产条件比往年有了改善。去年朝鲜北半部的大丰收，使朝鲜农村经济得到较大的恢复。农民们在今年春耕播种前，大都添置或修理了农具，添购了耕牛，精选了良种，为春耕播种作了充分准备。但是，困难仍旧很多。各地的劳动力和畜力都还是缺乏的。敌机、敌舰经常威胁着农民们的耕作。
    坚强的朝鲜农民勇敢地克服了这一切困难。他们合理地组织和调整了互助组和人畜换工班。广大农村妇女也都参加了农业生产，并且参加了扶犁。他们不顾敌机、敌舰的狂轰滥炸，填平被炸毁的田地，广泛地采用先进的生产方法，并热烈地展开了郡和郡，里和里，居民班和居民班之间的增产竞赛。接近海边的江原道文川郡的农民的英勇斗争是典型的例子。他们在每一块田地的角落里都挖掘了掩蔽壕，把人和耕畜都伪装起来，在敌机敌舰的轰击下坚持生产，并且还参加了增产竞赛。在竞赛中，老人和少年儿童团员们也都参加了播种、送肥等工作。结果，他们在四月十六日就完成了谷子、玉米、高粱、马铃薯等作物的播种计划。
    朝鲜政府和朝鲜劳动党对于农民的增产斗争，给予最大的关心和援助。朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅曾在春耕开始时，接见了平安南道的丰产农民和农村的党政干部，对农业生产的各个方面作了详尽的指示。此后，大批干部即被派到各市、郡去加强对春耕播种工作的指导和帮助。国家把无人耕种的土地分配给贫苦的农民和难民耕种，国家的农民银行并给农民们发放了大量的农业贷款。
    农民们并得到了朝中人民军队的热情帮助，朝中人民军队的战士们除协助朝鲜农民开荒、耕种、施肥和修复被敌机破坏的水道和田地外，有的利用自己的铁匠炉做出各种农具送给朝鲜农民，有的并在田野周围和海岸上布置了防御炮火，保护朝鲜农民进行生产。
