Anglo-American Competition in the Middle East
Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, Lu Pam Duder

Recent events, especially those in Iran, Egypt, Sudan, and regarding the so-called Middle East Command of the Atlantic Alliance, show that the contradictions between American and British imperialism in the Middle East are becoming increasingly acute. The power of British imperialism, which previously held a dominant position in this region, is in decline, while American imperialism, taking advantage of the difficulties of the British rulers, is intensifying its efforts to establish its dominance not only economically and financially but also politically and strategically. However, due to the rapid development of the people's opposition to Anglo-American imperialism and the movement for national liberation, and due to the Anglo-American ruling groups' attempts to adopt a common policy in opposing the people of the Middle Eastern countries and in using the Middle East as a military base, the contradictions between Britain and the United States have become complicated.

For a long time, the Middle East has been a center of competition for the major Western European powers. In the nineteenth century, Britain and France fought for control of Egypt; in 1882, Gladstone bombarded Alexandria, effectively turning Egypt into a colony under British military occupation; in the early twentieth century, Britain began to invade Iran, opening up oilfield concessions and establishing the Anglo-Persian (later Anglo-Iranian) Oil Company. By the early twentieth century, German imperialism had replaced French imperialism as the most threatening competitor to British interests in the Middle East. The Anglo-German rivalry in the Middle East was one of the important triggers of the First World War.

By the end of the First World War, with the defeat of German imperialism and the disintegration of the Turkish Empire, British imperialism had opened up a new Middle Eastern empire for itself. At that time, Syria and Lebanon were within the French sphere of influence, while Britain directly or indirectly ruled Egypt, Sudan, Cyprus, Malta, Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq, and Iran.

During the Second World War, as the position of French imperialism was greatly weakened, British imperialists were able to extend their rule to Syria and Lebanon as well. However, by the end of the Second World War, a new competitor, more powerful than German and French imperialism, began to undermine Britain's position in the Middle East. American imperialism gained a foothold in Arabia by supporting Ibn Saud against the Hashemite dynasty supported by Britain in Iraq and Jordan, establishing the Aramco oil company to compete with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and acquiring a quarter of Iraqi oil through the Mosul Four-Power Agreement.

After the Second World War, American monopoly capitalists expanded greatly. In 1938, the total oil production in the Middle East was 16 million tons, of which 2 million tons were controlled by the United States. By 1950, the total oil production in the Middle East had increased to 87 million tons, of which the United States controlled 40 million tons, or nearly half. The increasing dependence of Middle Eastern countries on American imports can be seen from the following facts: in 1949, Iran imported eighteen times more goods from the United States than it exported to the United States; Egypt imported nearly three times more, Iraq nearly 2.6 times more; Israel imported sixteen times more; and Syria and Lebanon imported more than twenty-nine times more from the United States than they exported to the United States.

In March 1947, the "Truman Doctrine" (which placed Greece and Turkey under American control) announced that the United States would politically and strategically control the Middle East. Britain, after conducting a brutal war to crush Greek democracy, had become too weak to maintain its spoils of aggression, and therefore had to make way for the Americans.

In 1948, the United States launched an offensive against British control of Palestine. For this purpose, the United States placed Zionism under its wing. Zionism, ever ready to serve a more powerful country and mainly subsidized by the United States, abandoned its former British masters and turned to serve American imperialism. Britain attempted to use the Arab League to wage war against the establishment of Israel, therefore supplying the Arab League countries with weapons, officers, and money, while the United States funded and equipped the Israeli army.

Thus, the contradictions between Britain and the United States in the Middle East took the form of open warfare, albeit indirectly through the Israeli vassal and the Arab League puppets. The result of this war was the collapse and defeat of the armies of the puppet rulers of the Arab League countries, and the establishment of the State of Israel as an American vassal in the Middle East. This result was a serious defeat for Britain.

Subsequent events have shown that the policy of "cooperation" between Britain and the United States in the Middle East does not mean a reduction in the contradictions and actual conflicts of interests between the two countries, or a temporary cessation of the American expansionist policy. On the contrary, the pressure exerted by the United States on Britain's position in the Middle East has greatly increased in the recent period. The rising movement of the Middle Eastern people against British imperialist rule has created intense political changes and instability in most Middle Eastern countries. Under these circumstances, American imperialists have profited from Britain's difficulties.

In Iran, the unanimous demand for nationalization of the oil industry achieved a resounding victory in 1951, Britain was forced to withdraw from Abadan, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was deprived of its "right" to plunder the Iranian people. The belligerent British government had declared that Britain would never withdraw from Abadan, and ostentatiously concentrated its land and naval forces, but all of this went bankrupt because the United States refused repeated British requests to support the proposed land and naval measures.

The Soviet-Iranian Treaty became a powerful protector of the Iranian people in those days.

Britain had hoped that the United States would support its measures in Iran, just as Britain supported American military measures in Korea. This only shows that the British rulers still did not understand the relationship between master and servant. At the most critical moment, the American government made it clear that the support desired by Britain would not come; British imperialism suffered a heavy defeat in Iran, losing its main resource – the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company octopus.

In the long negotiations, stalemate, and crisis that followed regarding the Iranian oil issue, Anglo-American contradictions were exposed. Britain imposed an oil export blockade on Iran. The first attempt by the oil tanker "Rose Mary" to break the blockade in 1952 was carried out under the name of an Italian company, but British newspapers reported that American monopoly capitalists were backing the Italian company. The "Rose Mary" was stopped in Aden, and its cargo was seized.

In August 1952, Britain conspired to launch a coup in Iran, establishing the Qavam government to replace the Mossadegh government; however, this was immediately met with popular resistance, and Qavam collapsed within twenty-four hours.

In December 1952, the American government officially announced that it would not object to American companies purchasing Iranian oil. As the "Observer" pointed out, this statement greatly "disappointed" Britain; so Mr. Eden publicly declared that Britain would continue to insist on the rights of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, "regardless of what views any other government may take."

In 1953, the oil tanker "Miriella" transported a shipment of Iranian oil to Venice. The American ambassador in Tehran formally presented new proposals to the Iranian government on behalf of both the United States and Britain: the United States would purchase Iranian oil and financially support Iran, on the condition that Iran accept an arbitration plan regarding the compensation issue for the confiscated Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

In Egypt, as the domestic crisis deepened, Anglo-American contradictions also intensified significantly. In the second half of 1951, the national liberation struggle reached its climax – the abrogation of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the declaration of the union of Egypt and Sudan, and the demand that Britain immediately withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone and Sudan. Under these circumstances, only the imposition of martial law prevented the progress of the people's movement.

After Naguib launched a coup in July 1952 and established a military dictatorship, American officials and semi-officials immediately expressed "satisfaction," and the widely circulated American magazine "Life" extensively promoted Naguib.

The United States attempted to force the British government to reach an agreement with Naguib, according to which Britain should relinquish control of Sudan and should formally "withdraw" from the Canal Zone, in order to hand it over as a base for the American-controlled Middle East Command. After lengthy negotiations, the first part of this plan came to fruition, and Naguib and the British government signed the Sudan Agreement on February 12, 1953.

This agreement aroused widespread criticism among British conservatives, who believed that it amounted to abandoning British influence in Sudan. However, British imperialism clearly did not consider the battle to be over.

After the Sudan Agreement, there followed negotiations on the Canal Zone. Currently, Britain has a very large armed force stationed in the Canal Zone, as well as military equipment worth over £180 million. It has been widely reported in the press that withdrawal has been agreed "in principle." However, the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations have again reached a stalemate. After many rounds of negotiations, the two sides have not even reached an agreement on the conditions for the withdrawal of British troops. World opinion believes that this is a complete failure of the attempt to reach an agreement on the withdrawal of British troops. Clearly, here too, British imperialism is doing everything possible to maintain this strongest stronghold. The "Observer" reported on February 22, 1953, that the British government's military advisors demanded that Egypt join the Middle East Command, with "existing bases remaining under British jurisdiction," and "Royal Air Force squadrons continuing to use Egyptian airfields, and requiring their own ground staff for maintenance and management," as the minimum conditions for the withdrawal of British troops. Naguib has announced that assuming obligations on the issue of the Middle East Command in advance cannot be a condition for withdrawal. However, once an agreement is reached on the issue of withdrawal, "we will show ourselves to be loyal allies of the West."

From all this complex intrigue, it can be clearly seen that the United States is pursuing a dual goal. On the one hand, weakening Britain, gradually pushing Britain out of its dominant position in the Middle East; on the other hand, preventing the expansion of the movement for liberation of the people of the Middle Eastern countries as a result.

×××

An analysis of the developing Anglo-American contradictions and conflicts in the Middle East, without taking into account the background of the rising tide of popular anger, the deepening economic crisis in the Middle Eastern countries, the widespread anti-imperialist sentiment among the people of these countries, and the rapid development of national liberation movements, cannot reflect the true situation in the Middle East.

The most barbaric repressive measures have not been able to contain the development of the people's movement; the adoption of military dictatorship in many Middle Eastern countries only shows the instability of the political situation in these countries. The strong national liberation movements in these countries are increasingly shaking the position of Anglo-American imperialism.

The People's Party of Iran, the Communist Parties of Iraq, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, represent the vital interests of the people of the Middle Eastern countries. In these countries, in Egypt and Sudan, the fighting people's movement points the way forward for the people of the Middle Eastern countries.

Although the American and British ruling groups continue to intrigue and compete for dominance in the Middle East, intensify their intrusion into the Middle Eastern countries, send military, economic, and technical delegations to the Middle Eastern countries, and attempt to establish reactionary puppet regimes as pillars of their interests, it is the people of the Middle Eastern countries who will have the final say, and they are moving towards the victorious future of the struggle for national independence and freedom.

    英美在中东的竞争
    英国共产党执行委员会副主席  鲁·帕姆·杜德
    最近的一些事件，尤其是在伊朗、埃及、苏丹以及在所谓大西洋联盟中东司令部的问题上所发生的事件，显示出美国帝国主义和英国帝国主义在中东的矛盾是日益尖锐了。先前在这个区域居统治地位的英国帝国主义的势力在衰退中，而美国帝国主义则利用英国统治者的困难，正在加紧推行一些激烈的措施，从而不但在经济上和财政上建立它的优势，而且在政治方面和战略方面也建立起它的优势。但是，由于人民反对英美帝国主义、争取民族解放运动的迅速发展，由于英美统治集团在反对中东各国人民以及在利用中东作为军事根据地的计划上企图采取共同的政策；就使得英美之间的矛盾变得复杂了。
        ×××
    很久以来，中东便是西欧各大国的竞争中心。在十九世纪，英国和法国争夺埃及的统治权；一八八二年格拉斯顿炮轰亚历山大港，使埃及实际上变成了英国军事占领下的殖民地；二十世纪初，英国开始侵入伊朗，开辟油田租借地，并建立了英国—波斯（后为英伊）石油公司。到二十世纪初期，德国帝国主义代替了法国帝国主义，而成为英国在中东的利益的最富威胁性的竞争者。英国和德国在中东争霸是第一次世界大战的重要的导火线之一。
    至第一次世界大战末，随着德国帝国主义的战败和土耳其帝国的瓦解，英国帝国主义就为自己开辟了新的中东帝国。那时，叙利亚和黎巴嫩在法国势力范围之内，英国则直接地或者间接地统治着埃及、苏丹、塞浦路斯岛、马耳他岛、巴勒斯坦、外约旦、伊拉克和伊朗。
        ×××
    在第二次世界大战期间，由于法国帝国主义的地位大大削弱，英国帝国主义者得以把他们的统治势力也扩展到叙利亚和黎巴嫩。然而，至第二次世界大战末，一个比德国帝国主义和法国帝国主义更强大的新的竞争者开始来破坏英国在中东的地位了。美国帝国主义用支持伊本·索欧德来反对英国在伊拉克和约旦所支持的哈歇米特王朝的方法在阿拉伯站稳了脚，设立阿美石油公司来和英伊石油公司竞争，并且通过摩苏尔四国协定取得了四分之一的伊拉克石油。
    第二次世界大战以后，美国垄断资本家大肆扩张。一九三八年，中东石油的总产量是一千六百万吨，其中由美国控制的有二百万吨，到一九五○年，中东石油的总产量增加到八千七百万吨，其中美国控制了四千万吨，也就是将近一半。中东各国之日益依赖于美国的输入品，可从下面的事实看出来：在一九四九年，伊朗从美国输入的货物，比向美国输出的货物多了十八倍；埃及多了将近三倍，伊拉克多了将近二点六倍；以色列多了十六倍；叙利亚和黎巴嫩从美国输入的比向美国输出的多了二十九倍以上。
    一九四七年三月，“杜鲁门主义”（它把希腊和土耳其置于美国的控制之下）宣布美国要在政治上和战略上控制中东。英国在进行了摧残希腊民主的野蛮战争以后，已经衰弱到不能再保持它的侵略果实的地步，因此不得不为美国人让出一条路来。
    一九四八年，美国向英国对巴勒斯坦的控制权实行进攻。为了这个目的，美国把犹太复国主义置于它的卵翼之下。随时准备为更强大的国家效劳，而又主要地受着美国津贴的犹太复国主义，便抛弃了它从前的英国主子，掉过头来为美国帝国主义服务了。英国企图利用阿拉伯联盟来进行反对以色列建国的战争，因此以武器、军官和金钱供给阿拉伯联盟各国，而美国则资助和装备以色列军队。
    这样，英美在中东的矛盾，至此便采取了公开战争的形式，不过这是间接地通过以色列附庸和阿拉伯联盟傀儡们来进行的而已。这个战争的结果是阿拉伯联盟国家的傀儡统治者的军队崩溃和失败了，而作为美国在中东的附庸的以色列国建立了。这个结果是英国的一个严重失败。
    以后的事件说明英美在中东的“合作”政策，绝不是意味着两国利益的矛盾和实际冲突的减少，或是美国扩张主义政策的暂时停止。相反的，美国对于英国在中东的地位所施的压力，在最近一个时期里是大大地增加了。中东人民反抗英国帝国主义统治的日益高涨的运动，在中东大多数国家里造成了激烈的政治变化和不稳的局势。在这种局势之下，美国帝国主义者就利用英国的困难从中渔利。
    ×××
    在伊朗，石油工业国有化的一致要求在一九五一年取得了赫赫的胜利，英国被迫退出了阿巴丹，英伊石油公司被剥夺了它的掠夺伊朗人民的“权利”。好战的英国政府曾经宣称英国决不退出阿巴丹，并且虚张声势地集中陆海军，但是由于美国拒绝了英国一再请求的支持它所建议的陆海军措施，结果都破产了。
    苏联—伊朗条约在那些日子里成了伊朗人民的强有力的保护者。
    英国曾经指望美国支持它在伊朗的这些措施，像英国支持美国在朝鲜的军事措施一样。这只是说明，英国统治者还不懂得主子和仆从的关系。在最危急的关头，美国政府明白地表示，英国所想望的支持是不会到来的；英国帝国主义在伊朗遭到了沉重的失败，丧失了主要资源——英伊石油公司这条章鱼。
    在后来关于伊朗石油问题的长期谈判、僵局和危机当中，英美矛盾暴露出来了。英国对伊朗实行了石油输出封锁。一九五二年“露丝·玛丽”号油船首次企图打破封锁，是在意大利公司的名义下进行的，但是，英国报纸报道说，美国垄断资本家们在意大利公司背后撑着腰。“露丝·玛丽”号油船在亚丁受阻，船上的货物被扣留了。
    一九五二年八月，英国阴谋在伊朗发动政变，成立盖凡姆政府来代替摩萨台政府；但是，这立刻遭到群众的反抗，盖凡姆在二十四小时之内就垮了台。
    一九五二年十二月，美国政府正式宣布，美国政府将不反对美国公司购买伊朗石油。正如“观察家报”所指出，这个声明使英国大为“失望”；于是艾登先生公开宣布，英国将继续坚持英伊石油公司的权利，“不管任何别的政府采取什么看法。”
    在一九五三年，“米利叶拉”号油船运了一船伊朗石油到威尼斯。驻德黑兰的美国大使正式同时代表美国和英国向伊朗政府提出了新的建议：由美国购买伊朗石油，并在财政上支持伊朗，条件是伊朗须接受一个关于被没收的英伊石油公司的赔偿问题的仲裁方案。
    ×××
    在埃及，随着国内危机的加深，英美矛盾也显著地激化了。一九五一年下半年，民族解放斗争达到了高潮——废除一九三六年英埃条约、宣布埃及和苏丹合并并要求英国立即从苏彝士运河区和苏丹撤出，在这种形势之下，只是实施了戒严令才阻遏了人民运动的进展的。
    一九五二年七月纳吉布发动政变并建立了军事独裁之后，美国官方和半官方立即表示“满意”，在美国销行很广的“生活”杂志为纳吉布大事宣传。
    美国企图强迫英国政府和纳吉布取得协议，根据这个协议，英国应该放弃对苏丹的控制，应该在形式上从运河区“撤退”，以便把它交出来作为美国所控制的中东司令部的一个基地。经过长期的谈判以后，这个方案的第一部分得到了结果，一九五三年二月十二日纳吉布和英国政府签订了苏丹协定。
    这个协定在英国保守派人士中引起了广泛的批评，认为这等于放弃英国在苏丹的势力。然而，英国帝国主义显然并不认为这场战斗已告结束。
    在苏丹协定之后，接着便是关于运河区的谈判。现在，英国在运河区驻有极大的武装部队，还有价值一亿八千万英镑以上的军事设备。报界已经普遍地报道说，已经“在原则上”同意撤退了。但是，英埃谈判又成了僵局。经过多次谈判之后，双方甚至对于英军撤退的条件都没有达成协议。世界舆论认为这件事是企图就英军撤退问题达成协议的彻底失败。显然，在这里，英国帝国主义也在千方百计地力图维持这个最坚固的据点。一九五三年二月二十二日“观察家报”报道说，英国政府的军事顾问要求埃及参加中东司令部，“现有基地仍归英国管辖”，“皇家空军中队继续使用埃及飞机场，而且须有自己的地勤人员做保养和管理工作”，以这些作为英国军队撤退的最低条件。纳吉布已经宣布，不能以事先在中东司令部的问题上承担义务来作为撤退的一个条件。但是，一旦在撤退问题上达成协议，“我们将表明自己是西方的忠实盟友”。
    从这一切复杂的钩心斗角之中，可以清楚地看出美国正追求着双重目标。一方面削弱英国，一步一步地把英国从它在中东的主要地位上排挤出去；另一方面，阻止中东各国人民解放运动因此而扩大起来。
        ×××
    对中东发展着的英美之间的矛盾和冲突的分析，如果不估计到人民怒潮的增涨、中东各国经济危机的加深、各国人民普遍反对帝国主义的情绪以及民族解放运动的迅速发展这种背景，那就不能反映中东局势的真实情况。
    最野蛮的压迫措施，也没有能遏制人民运动的发展；在中东许多国家中采取军事独裁的办法，只表明这些国家的政治局势的不稳定。这些国家的强有力的民族解放运动正使英美帝国主义的地位日益动摇。
    伊朗人民党，伊拉克、外约旦、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和以色列各国共产党，代表着中东各国人民的切身利益。在这些国家里，在埃及和苏丹，战斗的人民运动为中东各国人民指出了前途。
    尽管美英统治集团继续钩心斗角地争霸中东，加紧侵入中东各国，派遣军事、经济和技术代表团到中东各国，并且企图建立附庸的反动政权，作为它们的利益的支柱，但是，掌握最后决定权的将是中东各国人民，他们正向着争取民族独立和自由的斗争的胜利前途迈进。
