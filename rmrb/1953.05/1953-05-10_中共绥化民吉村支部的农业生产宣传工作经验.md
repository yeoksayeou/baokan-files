    The Minji Village Branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, correctly implemented the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation. After the village farmers were organized, their labor enthusiasm was greatly stimulated, and land yields were increased significantly. The average yield per hectare was 3.2 *shi* in 1948, 7.5 *shi* in 1950, and increased to 11.16 *shi* in 1952, exceeding the highest yield before 1943 by 77%. Therefore, it won the honorary titles of "National Model Village for High Yield" and "Provincial Model Village for Mutual Aid and Cooperation in High Yield."

    In the spring of 1948, the village Party branch also adopted coercive measures to organize mutual aid teams. At that time, based on the village's 13 large carts, teams were formed from west to east by household, establishing 13 large teams. Before the spring plowing was over, all 13 large teams disbanded. After the autumn harvest, under the leadership of the higher Party committee, the branch summarized the experience and lessons learned from leading mutual aid and cooperative production over the past year. Through this summary, the vast majority of Party members realized that mutual aid and cooperative organizations must be established in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. It was also decided that Communist Party members should not only deeply publicize the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies but also take the lead in participating in mutual aid teams to promote the organization of the entire village to improve production. After the meeting, the leading cadres of the Party branch made a review of the forced mutual aid at a mass meeting of the villagers and explained that in the future, mutual aid and cooperative organizations would be established based on voluntariness and mutual benefit. In the spring of 1949, based on the principle of voluntary association, 26 small mutual aid teams were established.

    Guiding Farmers Towards the Road of Agricultural Production Cooperation

    Mutual aid teams organized according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit did indeed greatly stimulate the labor enthusiasm of farmers and increased land yields. In 1951, in addition to food, clothing, and expenses, each household had a lot of surplus grain. Zhang Wennian's entire team had a surplus of 30,000 *jin* of grain and a surplus of more than 10 million *yuan*. At this time, some team members raised the issue of how to handle the surplus grain and funds. Some said, "Let's buy new farm tools, but the land is too small to use them." Others said, "There's not much motivation to stay in the mutual aid team anymore." The team members had their own plans. Some wanted to buy land, some wanted to add carts and horses, and some wanted to add farm tools and "go it alone." The emergence of these new problems provided the Party branch with the need to guide all farmers further forward in accordance with the direction indicated by the Party. At this time, the Party branch suggested that each mutual aid team hold a forum to discuss the following two questions: 1. Why has the output of mutual aid teams in our village increased year by year? 2. What are the urgent problems that need to be solved in the current mutual aid team? What methods should be used to solve them? Through the discussion of these two questions, the vast majority of farmers further recognized the benefits of "getting organized" and began to express dissatisfaction with the existing forms of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, but could not think of a good solution. At this time, the branch introduced the organizational form of agricultural production cooperatives to everyone and focused on explaining the management system of agricultural production cooperatives, as well as labor discipline, distribution system, the future of the cooperative, etc. It also selected examples of advanced agricultural production cooperatives and asked propagandists to introduce them to everyone. That winter, men, women, old and young in the entire village were talking about agricultural production cooperatives, and repeated debates were sparked between fathers and sons, and husbands and wives in each family. People who had personally felt the need to improve the mutual aid team actively advocated the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, but did not know much about the nature, system, etc. of the cooperatives. Those who did not recognize the superiority and nature of the cooperatives did not advocate the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. In response to these ideological situations, the branch adopted methods such as mass meetings, forums, and individual visits to repeatedly publicize the superiority and various systems of agricultural production cooperatives. In this way, most farmers had a preliminary understanding of agricultural production cooperatives; through this publicity, the branch committee further understood the ideological situation of the farmers. The erroneous understanding of agricultural production cooperatives by individual branch committee members was also corrected. For example, Zhao Fu, the propaganda committee member of the Party branch, originally had a mentality of being impatient and rash, thinking that he could reach socialism all at once; now he realized that the farmers' thinking was not uniform, and he had to go step by step.

    After two or three months of propaganda and education, most farmers admitted that "cooperatives are better than mutual aid teams." Under the leadership and promotion of the branch, on the one hand, an agricultural production cooperative was formed on the basis of the Zhang Wennian mutual aid team, absorbing households from the other three perennial mutual aid teams who were willing to join the cooperative; on the other hand, the existing mutual aid teams were continued to be consolidated and improved, and special attention was paid to educating those who were unwilling to join the cooperative, so that they could concentrate on production and work hard in production.

    Doing a Good Job in Consolidating Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    After the agricultural production cooperative was formed, in order to strengthen the ideological education of the members, in addition to the meeting and study systems stipulated by the administrative side of the cooperative, the branch also assigned the four Party members, nine members of the Communist Youth League, and eleven propagandists who joined the cooperative to various production teams, adopting the method of "contracting responsibility" to continuously conduct propaganda and education work to the team members. It also paid attention to strengthening the specific leadership of the propaganda and education work, and often raised questions and formulated propaganda plans and schemes based on the situation within the cooperative, and handed them over to the propagandists to carry out propaganda. In this way, the work of Party members, League members, and propagandists was completely focused on consolidating the work of the agricultural production cooperative. This was very necessary. Not long after the establishment of the cooperative, the individualistic thinking of the members often conflicted with the collective labor of the cooperative. For example, when driving a cart, some members would only whip other people's horses and were reluctant to whip their own; some would put their own horses on the less strenuous harness; some would not care about things that harmed the interests of the cooperative, thinking, "How much will the loss be in my name? Why offend people!" When feeding the horses, some said, "My horse can't eat as much as Lao Li's horse, it's a loss to eat the same amount of fodder." Some secretly used the cooperative's fodder to feed their own livestock early every morning, affecting other people's horses from not getting enough to eat. When delivering manure to each member's vegetable garden, some members sent the manure to their own garden, and did not send or sent less to other people's land. After the branch understood and studied these situations, on the one hand, it explained to everyone the principle that "agricultural production cooperatives belong to all members, and members should treat everything in the cooperative with the attitude of masters," and on the other hand, it used typical people and typical events to educate all members. Gao Dianju, a member, had a bad attitude towards labor. He would move a little if someone told him to, and he would be idle if no one told him to. Whoever criticized him would say that someone had a feud with him. After the branch discovered this, it immediately sent Zhao Fu, the propaganda committee member of the branch, to conduct individual education on him, so that Gao Dianju realized his mistake and immediately changed his past erroneous labor attitude. He was able to take the initiative to find work to do, and sometimes fed the horses all night and still worked as usual during the day. The branch invited Gao Dianju to report to all members on his ideological transformation process; it also mobilized all members to conduct discussions. During the discussion, each member compared and examined their own thoughts. This played a great educational role in correcting the members' attitude towards labor and strengthening the concept of cherishing public property. When publicizing agricultural production technology, the branch also paid attention to conducting patient propaganda and education on the conservative thinking of some members. In 1952, when the horse-drawn harvester was promoted, some members said, "If that thing is easy to use, it will starve the people who use sickles to death." "It is rare since ancient times for farmers not to use sickles." Especially when the horse-drawn harvester malfunctioned, some members sarcastically said, "The harvester can compete with my sickle!" Party members and League members quickly helped the technicians repair the harvester. When Zhang Wennian used the harvester the next day, everyone in the village came to watch again. The horse-drawn harvester did indeed cut quickly and well. In this way, even the always conservative old man had to say, "This thing saves labor and gets things done!" At this time, the propagandist publicized the benefits of new farm tools to everyone. After many propaganda and education efforts, the agricultural production cooperative gradually became consolidated.

    Using the Achievements of the Village's Agricultural Production Cooperative to Promote Mutual Aid and Cooperative Production in the Entire Village

    The branch of this village often consciously publicized the achievements of the village's agricultural production cooperative to promote mutual aid and cooperation throughout the village. Therefore, whenever the agricultural production cooperative has a new achievement, the branch will promptly organize farmers throughout the village to visit the site. For example, the agricultural production cooperative had a cornfield next to a cornfield of a mutual aid team. The cornfield of the agricultural production cooperative was planted using seed disinfection and "digging holes" to apply manure, and new cultivation methods such as thinning seedlings and applying topdressing in stages were implemented; three ridges of the mutual aid team's cornfield also used the new methods of the agricultural production cooperative, but did not apply topdressing; the rest of the land was planted using the old methods. As a result, three different qualities of crops grew on this land: the crops of the agricultural production cooperative grew neatly and lushly, and people could not be seen when they entered; the three ridges of the mutual aid team planted using the new method were inferior to the cooperative because they were not topdressed; and the crops planted entirely using the old method only reached people's waists. At the suggestion of the branch, a field visit was organized to evaluate these three qualities of crops, and at the same time, to study and discuss the question of "Why did three different qualities of crops grow on one piece of land?" Finally, everyone said: "Don't be afraid of not knowing the goods, as long as the goods are compared with each other, a comparison will show the pros and cons; who doesn't envy the cooperative! This is technology, and we have to pay attention to this in the future!" After the harvest, Sun Xi, who used the horse-drawn harvester, was organized to report to the entire village on the fact that the cooperative had done a good job in allocating labor appropriately and properly. Sun Xi excitedly said to everyone: "Speaking of the benefits of the cooperative, I can't finish it in three days and three nights; everyone knows that I have 'houba' (asthma), and I was afraid of being paid according to work when I joined the cooperative. I can't catch my breath when I bend down to use the sickle, how can I compare with other people's labor. Later, the leading cadres of the cooperative said that I couldn't use the sickle, so they asked me to use the horse-drawn harvester. Who would have thought that there would be such a day in the cooperative that I could harvest crops without using a sickle. At that time, I thought: In the past, I got 'houba' from working so hard for the landlord, but today the cooperative uses a harvester, freeing me, this 'houba'. This is the benefit of the Communist Party leading us to organize cooperatives." After the members of the mutual aid team heard Sun Xi's introduction, they all believed that "the method of tailoring the work to the individual's ability is good, and if everyone's work is allocated appropriately, production will become more energetic." After that, the mutual aid team also adopted the method of allocating production tasks according to each person's strengths. Especially after the autumn harvest, the branch also absorbed farmers from the entire village to participate in the cooperative's grain distribution meeting, so that everyone could understand the cooperative's harvest situation and distribution system. At the meeting, Wang Ximing, the director of the cooperative, made a summary report to all members, pointing out that the average yield per hectare for the whole year was 11.57 *shi*, an increase of 29% compared to last year, 20% higher than the best mutual aid team in the village, and the income from sideline businesses increased four times compared to previous years, and the net profit income of the members was 35 *shi*. Then, the distribution was made on the spot, and the cooperative drove carts to deliver grain to each household. Here, the cart drivers waved their red-tasseled whips and drove the big horses to deliver grain to each household, while Party members, League members, propagandists, and farmers who came to visit held a forum; at the meeting, Liang Xianzong, a member of the mutual aid team, compared his own income and said: "In the spring, someone asked me to join the cooperative, but at that time I thought they were too many people and it would be chaotic, and they wouldn't grow the land well; in the autumn, I saw that the crops in the cooperative grew better than ours, and at that time I thought: although they grow well, after deducting this and that, and repaying the loan, there won't be much left; today I see that the least is one-third more than what I harvested. People have laid the foundation first, and we are one year late, let's join the cooperative next year!" Liu Zhenhai, who insisted on not joining the cooperative in the spring, regretted it very much and immediately asked to join the cooperative on the spot. In addition, when the agricultural production cooperative held regular meetings, it also absorbed key members of the mutual aid team to participate, in order to promote the work within the mutual aid team.

    Because the branch often publicized the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives through specific examples, 184 households in the village asked to join the agricultural production cooperative, greatly advancing the mutual aid and cooperation work in the entire village.

    中共绥化民吉村支部的农业生产宣传工作经验
    黑龙江省绥化县民吉村由于中共支部正确地贯彻了党的互助合作政策，全村农民组织起来后大大地发挥了劳动积极性，提高了土地的产量。一九四八年平均每垧单位产量是三石二斗，一九五○年是七石五斗，到一九五二年就增加到十一石一斗六升，超过了一九四三年前最高产量百分之七十七。因此，荣获全国“丰产模范村”和全省“互助合作丰产模范村”的光荣称号。
    在一九四八年春天，这个村的党支部也曾采用强迫命令的办法组织互助组。当时以全村十三台大车为基准，从西到东按户编组，成立了十三个大组。春耕还没有结束，这十三个大组都散了伙。秋收以后，在上级党的领导下，支部总结了一年来领导互助合作生产的经验教训；通过这一总结，使绝大部分的党员认识到必须按照自愿两利的原则来建立互助合作组织；并决定了共产党员一面要深入宣传党的互助合作政策，一面要带头参加互助组，推动全村组织起来搞好生产。会后，党的领导干部在全村群众大会上作了关于强迫互助的检讨，并说明今后要按照自愿两利来建立互助合作组织。一九四九年春天，本自愿结合的原则，成立了二十六个小型互助组。
    引导农民走向农业生产合作的道路
    按自愿两利原则组成的互助组，的确是大大地发挥了农民的劳动积极性，提高了土地的产量。一九五一年各户除了吃穿花消以外，有了很多的余粮；张文年全组可余三万斤粮，并有余款一千多万元。这时有些组员就提出余粮余款处理的问题。有的说：“买新式农具吧，可是地少用不了。”也有的说：“再留在互助组里没多大劲头了。”组员们心里各有各的打算，有的想买地，有的想添置车马，有的想添置农具后“单干”。这些新问题的出现，也就提供了党支部必须根据党所指示的方向，把全体农民再引导前进一步。这时党支部建议各个互助组召开座谈会讨论下面两个问题：一、本村互助组的产量为什么能年年增加？二、现在互助组里有那些急需解决的问题？用什么办法解决？通过这两个问题的讨论，绝大部分的农民进一步认清了“组织起来”的好处，对现有的互助合作组织形式开始表示不满，但又想不出一个好的办法来。这时，支部即向大家介绍了农业生产合作社的组织形式，并着重讲解了农业生产合作社的经营管理制度，以及劳动纪律、分配制度、合作社的前途等等；还选择了先进农业生产合作社的事例，由宣传员向大家介绍。这一年的冬天，全村男、女、老、少都在谈论农业生产合作社这件事，并在每个家庭父子、夫妻之间，引起了反复的争论。已经切身感到需要将互助组提高一步的人，积极地主张成立农业生产合作社，但对合作社的性质、制度等等也了解得不多。对合作社的优越性及其性质没有认识的人，就不主张成立农业生产合作社。针对这些思想情况，支部又采取了大会报告、座谈会和个别访问等方法，反复地宣传农业生产合作社的优越性和各种制度。这样大部分农民对农业生产合作社有了初步的了解；支委会也通过这一宣传，进一步了解了农民的思想情况。个别支部委员对农业生产合作社的错误认识也得到了纠正。例如党支部宣传委员赵福，本来有急躁冒进情绪，以为一下子就可走到社会主义；现在认识了农民的思想不是一剪子齐的，得一步一步地走。
    经过了两三个月的宣传教育后，大多数农民承认了：“合作社要比互助组好”。在支部的领导推动下一方面先以张文年互助组为基础，吸收了其他三个常年互助组内愿意入社的各户，组成了一个农业生产合作社；另一方面继续巩固和提高现有的互助组，尤其注意了对不愿入社的人进行了教育工作，使他们安心生产，努力生产。
    做好巩固农业生产合作社的工作
    在农业生产合作社组成以后，支部为了加强对社员的思想教育工作，除了合作社行政方面规定的一些会议、学习制度外，又把入社的四个党员、九个团员和十一个宣传员，分别编置在各个生产队中，采用“包干负责制”的方法，向组员不断进行宣传教育工作；又注意加强了对宣传教育工作的具体领导，经常根据社内情况提出问题，制订宣传计划方案，交给宣传员进行宣传。这样党员、团员、宣传员的工作完全集中在巩固农业生产合作社工作上了。这是非常必要的。合作社成立不久，社员的个人主义思想和合作社的集体劳动经常发生矛盾。例如：在赶车时有的社员尽打别人家的马，舍不得打自己的；也有把自己的马套在不费劲的套上；有的见到损害合作社利益的事情不去过问，认为：“损失到我名下能有多少，何必得罪人！”喂马时，有的说：“我的马没有老李家的马能吃，出一样多的草料吃了亏。”有的每天清早偷偷地用社里的草料喂自己的牲口，影响别人的马吃不饱。在给各个社员的菜园地送粪时，有的社员把粪送在自己的园地里，别人地里不送或少送。支部了解和研究了这些情况后，一面向大家讲解：“农业生产合作社是全体社员的，社员应以主人翁的态度来对待社里的每一件事”的道理，一面通过典型人、典型事在全体社员中进行教育。社员高殿举的劳动态度不好，别人支使他一下就动一下，不支使就闲着，谁要批评了他，就说谁跟他有仇。支部发现后即派支部宣传委员赵福对他进行个别教育，使高殿举认识了错误，并立即改变过去的错误劳动态度，已能主动地找工作做，有时通宵喂马，白天还照常作活。支部就请高殿举向全体社员报告自己的思想转变过程；又发动全体社员进行了讨论。讨论中每个社员均对照检查了自己的思想。这对端正社员的劳动态度，加强爱护公共财物的观念起了很大的教育作用。宣传农业生产技术时，支部也注意了对部分社员的保守思想进行耐心的宣传教育。一九五二年推广使用马拉收割机时，有的社员说：“那玩艺儿好使就要饿死打镰刀的。”“庄稼人不使镰刀，这是亘古以来稀有罕见的事。”尤其在马拉收割机发生了故障的时候，有的社员就讽刺说：“收割机可以和我的镰刀比赛啦！”党员和团员赶快帮助技术工人修好收割机。当第二天张文年使用收割机时，全村人又都围着来看，马拉收割机的确割的又快又好，这样，连一向保守的老汉也不得不说：“这玩艺就是省工出活！”宣传员就在这个时候向大家宣传新农具的好处。经过多次的宣传教育，农业生产合作社也就逐渐地巩固下来了。
    用本村农业生产合作社的成就，推动全村互助合作的生产
    这个村的支部经常有意识地宣传本村农业生产合作社的成就，推动全村的互助合作工作。因之，每当农业生产合作社有一个新的成就时，支部就及时组织全村农民去实地参观。如农业生产合作社有块苞米地和一个互助组的苞米地挨近，农业生产合作社的苞米地是经过种籽消毒、“刨埯”点粪的方法播种的，又实行了间苗分期追肥等新耕作方法；这个互助组的苞米地有三垄也使用了农业生产合作社的新方法，但没有追肥；其余的地是用旧法播种的。结果这一片地上长出了三种成色的庄稼：农业生产合作社的庄稼长的齐刷刷、绿油油的，人进去看不见；互助组用新法种的三垄地由于未追肥就比合作社的差一些，完全用旧法种的，只到人腰部。在支部建议下组织了田间参观，来评比这三种成色的庄稼，同时并研究讨论了：“为什么一片地上长出了三种成色的庄稼”这个问题。最后大家说：“不怕不识货，只要货比货，一比就比出高低来了；谁不羡慕合作社！这就是技术，今后咱得讲究这个了！”在收割以后，又组织了使用马拉收割机的孙喜向全村报告了合作社在劳力分配上，做到“量体裁衣”适当妥善分配工作的事实。孙喜激动地向大家说：“说起合作社的好处，咱三天三夜也说不完；大家知道我是‘喉叭’（气喘病），入社晨光，怕按劳分粮。咱一弯腰使镰刀就喘不上气来，怎能和人家的劳动比。后来合作社的领导干部说咱不能使镰刀，就叫使马拉收割机。谁想到在合作社里有这么一天，不用镰刀也可以收割庄稼了。当时咱心思：过去给地主抗大活累得了‘喉叭’，今天合作社使用了收割机，解放了我这个‘喉叭’。这就是共产党领导咱组织合作社的好处。”互助组员听过孙喜介绍的情况后，都认为：“量体裁衣这个办法就是好，每个人的活分配适当了，生产就会搞的更来劲。”此后互助组也采用了按各人特长分配生产任务的办法。特别是在秋收以后，支部又吸收全村农民参加了合作社的粮食分配会议，使大家了解合作的收获情形与分配制度。会上合作社主任王喜明向全体社员做了总结报告，指出：全年单位面积产量每垧平均十一石五斗七升，较去年提高百分之二十九，比本村最好的互助组高出百分之二十，副业收入比往年增加了四倍，社员的纯利收入是三十五石。接着就当场分配，按户由合作社驾车送粮。这里赶车的一边挥着红缨鞭赶着大马把粮食送给各户，一边由党员、团员、宣传员和来参观的农民举行座谈会；会上互助组员梁显忠对比了自己的收入后说：“在春天有人叫我入社，当时我觉得他们人多乱哄哄的，种不好地；秋天，看到社里的庄稼比咱长的好，那时觉得：长的虽好，收下来扣扣这、除除那，还还贷款就没啥了；今天一看，最少的也比我多收三分之一。人家先打下基础了，咱晚走一年，来年入社再?吧！”春天坚持不肯入社的刘振海后悔极了，当场就要求入社。此外，农业生产合作社举行例会时，还吸收互助组骨干分子参加，以此来推动互助组内的工作。
    由于支部经常通过具体事例来宣传农业生产合作社的好处，全村就有一百八十四户要求参加农业生产合作社，把全村的互助合作工作大大地推进了一步。
