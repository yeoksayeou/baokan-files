A Mountain Village on the Korean Battlefield
Xinhua News Agency reporter Dai Huang

    This is a mountain village on the eastern front of Korea, close to the front lines. Here, the roar of cannons and the continuous sound of machine guns can be heard all day long. At night, the searchlights from the enemy's positions often cross the mountain ridges in front of the lines and shine on the mountains beside the village, and bombs and shells often explode near the mountain village, flashing with the light of explosions. However, the residents of this mountain village, like the residents of many other villages close to the front lines, live with extraordinary composure. When spring arrives, the old men and women shout at the yellow oxen to cultivate the fields riddled with bomb craters. They are often enveloped in the gray-yellow smoke raised by shells or bombs, along with the people and oxen. They have become accustomed to calmly carrying out their labor in this dangerous environment.

    More than a year ago, I visited the eastern front in the severe cold. At that time, many villages were empty. The gray-black tiled houses had many dark holes, and the surroundings of the houses were full of withered yellow weeds. I found an old man with white hair in an air-raid shelter at the foot of a mountain in a certain place. He pointed to the north with a trembling finger and told me: "The people in the village have all fled to the rear."

    As the Korean and Chinese People's forces established solid defense lines near the 38th parallel, the residents near the front lines returned one after another. In April of last year, seventeen households began to return to this mountain village, followed by more than seventy households. They removed the weeds from the barren land, and with the help of the Korean government and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, they overcame the difficulties of lacking manpower and seeds, and cultivated nearly 30,000 "pyeong" of land. Although the enemy's shells and bombs destroyed a full 500 "pyeong" of crops, they still harvested more than 52,500 kilograms of grain and dedicated 9,648 kilograms of grain to the state.

    By mid-May of this year, 217 households, or 997 people, had returned to this mountain village. This number is close to the total population of the village before the war. They began to organize mutual aid production organizations and build houses suitable for wartime conditions. By the end of May, all the people in the village had sturdy and hidden underground shelters to live in. They also built a "democratic propaganda room" that was five meters wide and twenty meters long underground as a place for the people of the village to carry out recreational and learning activities. More than 300 children formed the Young Pioneers and studied under the shade of trees on the hillside where shells could not reach.

    The residents of this mountain village actively support their protectors - the Korean and Chinese People's forces. Stretcher bearers help the troops transfer the wounded without avoiding hardship. On May 20th, Zhao Handou, a member of the blood transfusion team, donated hundreds of CCs of fresh blood to save the life of a soldier. The transportation team often helps the troops transport supplies to the front lines. The shouting team also actively learns how to shout to the soldiers of the Rhee's army. Even the children, in cooperation with the members of the Democratic Youth League, men and women, have made many consolation performances for the Korean and Chinese People's forces.

    Now, the wheat in the fields around this mountain village has grown ears, and the rice seedlings in the paddy fields between the valleys have emerged from the water. Although the enemy often deliberately fires long-range artillery shells into these farmland, and on the 20th killed a farmer who was cultivating, the residents of this village still overfulfilled the original cultivation plan by 111%. Because there is a firm belief that allows them to live peacefully in this mountain village near the front lines. That is: lying in front of their home is an unbreakable line of defense established and defended by the heroic Korean and Chinese People's forces. The invaders' beastly hooves can no longer trample on their land.

### 朝鲜战地的一个山村

    朝鲜战地的一个山村
    新华社记者  戴煌
    这是朝鲜东部战线接近前线的一个山村。在这里，整天都听到隆隆的炮声和连续不断的机关枪声。夜里，敌人阵地上的探照灯光时常越过前线的山岭照到村旁的山上，炸弹和炮弹也时常在山村附近闪着爆炸的火光。但是，这个山村的居民和接近前线的其他许多村庄的居民一样，都异常镇定地生活着。当春天来到的时候，老人和妇女们便吆喝着黄牛在弹坑累累的田地里耕种。他们常常连人带牛被炮弹或炸弹炸起的灰黄色的烟雾所笼罩。他们已经习惯了在这种危险的环境中镇定地进行自己的劳动。
    一年多以前，我在严寒里到过东部前线。那时许多村庄都是空荡荡的，灰黑色的瓦屋露着许多黑洞洞的窟窿，房屋周围尽是枯黄的野草。我在某地山脚下的一个防空洞里找到了一位白发老人，他用颤抖的手指着北方告诉我：“村里的人都逃到后方去了。”
    由于朝中人民部队在三八线附近建立了稳固的防线，不久，战线附近的居民就陆续地回来了。去年四月，开始有十七户人家回到了这个山村，接着又回来了七十多户。他们拔除了荒芜的土地上的野草，在朝鲜政府和中国人民志愿军战士们的帮助下，克服了缺乏人力和种籽的困难，耕种了近三万坪土地。虽然敌人的炮弹和炸弹炸去了整整五百坪庄稼，但他们仍然收获了五万二千五百多公斤的粮食，并将九千六百四十八公斤的粮食献给国家。
    到今年五月中旬，这个山村已回来二百十七户人家，九百九十七人了。这个数字已接近战前全村人口的总数。他们开始组织起互助的生产组织，修建适合战地条件的住屋。到五月底，全村人民都有坚固而隐蔽的地下室居住了。他们在地下还修起了一个五公尺宽、二十公尺长的“民主宣传室”，作为全村人民进行文娱和学习活动的场所。三百多个孩子成立了少年团，在炮弹打不到的山坡上的树荫下进行学习。
    这个山村的居民，积极支援自己的保卫者——朝中人民部队。担架队员不避劳苦地帮助部队转运伤员。输血队队员赵汉豆在五月二十日献出了数百CC鲜血救活了一位战士的生命。运输队常常帮助部队向前线运送物资。喊话组也积极学习怎样向李伪军士兵喊话。连儿童们也配合民主青年同盟的男女盟员，向朝中人民部队作了许多次慰问演出。
    现在，这个山村周围农田里的麦子已经长出穗子了，谷间水田里的秧苗已经冒出了水面。尽管敌人常常故意把远射程大炮的炮弹打到这些农田里，二十日又炸死了一位正在耕作的农民。但是，这个村子里的居民还是超额完成了原定耕作计划的百分之一百十一。因为有一种坚定的信念使他们安心的在这个火线附近的山村生活下去。这就是：横在他们家门口的是一条由英雄的朝中人民部队所建立和防守的牢不可破的防线。侵略者的兽蹄再也不能来践踏他们的土地了。
