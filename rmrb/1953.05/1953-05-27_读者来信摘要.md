Reader's Letters Abstract
    Demands for Swift Handling of Zhu Weiwu,
    Xu Jingxiu, and Other Instances of Violations of Law and Discipline
    --Summary of Readers' Letters
    Following the April 18th report in this newspaper about the "Anhui Shexian Health Center Secretary Zhu Weiwu and others seriously interfering with freedom of marriage, driving a person to death" incident and the "Complaint by Comrades Cai Wei and others regarding the illegal forced marriage by cadres of the Huaiyuan Public Security Bureau," we immediately and continuously received letters from readers across the country expressing their resentment toward bad people and bad deeds and supporting the accusations of Comrades Cai Wei and others.
    Regarding the Shexian Health Center incident, Nanjing reader Tan Binggui wrote: "Zhu Weiwu and others frantically forced Jiang Lili to commit suicide by jumping into a well, and even dissected Jiang Lili's body. Why are they so cruel and vicious! Do they have even a trace of the demeanor of people's cadres?" Feng Bin of the Shanxi Third Workers and Peasants' Rapid Completion Elementary School wrote: "These lawless and undisciplined elements like Zhu Weiwu and others have no regard for the law or the people in their hearts. Other people's love is illegal, but they can force people to death and open coffins to dissect bodies." Li Guanting of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company Shandong Changle County Business Office wrote: "When Zhao Lipin reported the situation of being persecuted to County Chief Liu Wenzhou of that county, Liu Wenzhou ignored it. This is such serious bureaucracy! Later, the absurd decision to sentence Zhao Lipin to imprisonment is even more intolerable."
    Regarding the Huaiyuan County Public Security Bureau incident, Hunan reader Xiao Baiping and Tao Honglin of the Songjiang Provincial Cooperative Union and others wrote: The Public Security Bureau should be an organ protecting the safety of the people; public security personnel should take the lead in implementing the Marriage Law and setting an example for the masses. However, such a bad incident occurred in the Huaiyuan County Public Security Bureau, and public security personnel such as Xu Jingxiu and others were so lawless and undisciplined. Wu Xia of the Beidajie Police Station of the Changzhou Public Security Bureau in Jiangsu Province wrote: "The erroneous behavior of Xu Jingxiu and others, who know the law and violate it, has simply degenerated into the style of the Kuomintang reactionary police." Youth League member Chen Honggen wrote: "I want to ask, does the Huaiyuan County Working Committee of the Youth League know about Lin Zuqin's expulsion from the League? If so, on what grounds did they agree to the expulsion?"
    Every reader's letter demands swift and severe punishment for these lawless bad elements such as Zhu Weiwu and Xu Jingxiu. They propose: that appropriate care should be given to victims such as Lin Zuqin; and that relevant leaders should make profound self-criticisms of their bureaucracy. One worker reader wrote specifically: "The Zhu Weiwu, Xu Jingxiu, and other incidents of violations of law and discipline should be dealt with in mass meetings in order to quickly recover the losses suffered by the Party and the People's Government among the masses." Zhang Jingchun and thirteen others from the Changchun Grain Company Storage and Transportation Section wrote: "We all feel that the exposure of these bad people and bad deeds has further made us realize the brilliance of the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party; if this movement against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline had not taken place, and if these bad people and bad deeds had not been reversed, how much would it hinder the construction of our motherland. In addition to supporting the accusations of Comrades Cai Wei and others, we are determined to actively participate in the struggle to expose bad people and bad deeds."

    Opinions on the Printing and Posting of Propaganda Posters
    He Shiwei of the Finance Section of the Puning County People's Government in Guangdong Province wrote: Using a large number of printed propaganda posters to publicize policies, introduce production experience, and commend heroic models to improve the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses is a meaningful and effective method. However, in the districts and townships I have visited, cadres do not sufficiently recognize the propaganda and educational significance of these propaganda posters, or due to bureaucracy, the propaganda posters are not well posted or even frozen when they are sent to the districts and townships. For example, the propaganda posters, comic strip posters, or notices compiled and printed by the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central South Administrative Committee, the Health Department, the Department of Culture and Education, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, the Democratic Women's Federation, and the Yue Dong Administrative Office are posted everywhere in the offices of the first and eleventh district people's governments of this county, and each comrade's private room has several of them. The first district even has a backlog of posters that have not been sent to the townships. The district transportation worker thought they were not being sent out, so he took them to his room to patch up wall holes, stick them on the table, and hang clothes on them. In the Wujing Township of the eleventh district, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government's No. 012 large notice on protecting forests and preventing fires and the Democratic Women's Federation's "Mandarin Duck Silver" large propaganda poster (the story of a widow's free marriage) were repeatedly posted together in one house. Sanzhai Township also repeatedly posted the "Illustrated Explanation of the Marriage Law" compiled by the Democratic Women's Federation on the walls of the township government.
    These propaganda posters have not been widely and deeply distributed to the masses, but have remained in district governments, township governments, and even private rooms. This is so irresponsible and wasteful!
    I suggest that when superior leading organs print propaganda posters, they should control the quantity, appropriately allocate them, clearly instruct the key points of publicity and posting methods, and establish a system for timely inspection. District and township governments should seriously value propaganda posters. It is best to set up special columns for posting propaganda posters in each village and assign special personnel to be responsible for management and protection. If a live posting method can be adopted, it would be better to rotate postings in various places. When necessary, propaganda workers can be organized to explain the content of the pictures and collect feedback from the masses, so that each propaganda poster can fully play its role in propaganda and education.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    要求迅速处理朱唯物
    徐敬修等违法乱纪事件
    ——读者来信综述
    四月十八日本报报道“安徽歙县卫生院秘书朱唯物等严重干涉婚姻自由逼死人命”事件和蔡伟等同志“对怀远公安局干部非法逼婚的控告”后，立即连续收到各地读者对坏人坏事表示愤恨和支持蔡伟等同志的控诉的信件。
    关于歙县卫生院事件，南京读者谭秉贵来信说：“朱唯物等疯狂迫使江丽丽投井自杀，竟还剖开了江丽丽的尸体。他们为什么要这样残酷毒辣呢！请问在他们身上还有一点点人民干部的气味吗？”山西省第三工农速成初等学校冯彬来信说：“朱唯物等这些违法乱纪分子，在他们心目中已无所谓法律了，也无所谓人民了。别人恋爱是非法，而他们却可以逼人致死、开棺剖尸。”中国煤业建筑器材公司山东省昌乐县经营处李冠廷来信说：“当赵立品把受迫害的情况报告给该县县长刘文周后，刘文周竟然没有理会，这是多么严重的官僚主义！后来，竟又荒谬地决定判处赵立品徒刑，更是令人不能容忍”。
    关于怀远县公安局事件。湖南省读者萧白萍、松江省合作社联合社陶鸿林等来信都说：公安局应该是一个保护人民安全的机关；公安人员，应该是带头执行婚姻法、给人民群众作榜样的。但怀远县公安局竟发生那么恶劣的事件，公安人员徐敬修等竟那样违法乱纪。江苏省常州市公安局北大街派出所吴霞来信说：“徐敬修等这种知法犯法的错误行为，简直堕落成和国民党反动派警察的作风一样了。”青年团员陈洪根来信说：“我要问一问，青年团怀远县工作委员会是否知道林祖琴被开除团籍的事？如果知道，是以什么理由同意开除的？”
    每一封读者来信都要求迅速严惩朱唯物、徐敬修等这些无法无天的坏分子。提出：对受害人林祖琴等应该作适当照顾；有关领导人应该深刻检讨官僚主义。一工人读者来信中特别说：“对朱唯物、徐敬修等违法乱纪事件，应该开群众大会来处理，以便迅速挽回党和人民政府在群众中所受到的损失。”长春市粮食公司储运科张景春等十三人来信中则说：“我们一致感到，对这些坏人坏事的揭发，使我们进一步认识到我们伟大领袖毛主席和共产党领导的英明；假如没有这一次反官僚主义、反强迫命令和反违法乱纪的运动，不反掉这些坏人坏事，那对我们祖国的建设不知将会有多大妨碍。我们除了支持蔡伟等同志的控诉外，决心积极参加揭发坏人坏事的斗争。”
    对印发和张挂宣传画的意见
    广东省普宁县人民政府财政科何世伟来信：利用大量印制的宣传画，向群众宣传政策，介绍增产经验，表扬英雄模范，以提高群众政治觉悟与生产热情，这是有意义的、有效的一种办法。但是以我所到过的区、乡来说，干部对这类宣传画的宣传教育意义还认识不足，或因官僚主义的缘故，致使宣传画发至区、乡时没有很好张贴甚至冻结了。例如：中南行政委员会农林部、广东省人民政府卫生处、文教厅、农林厅和民主妇联，粤东行政公署等单位所编制印发的宣传画、连环画招贴或布告，在本县第一区、第十一区人民政府机关内各处都贴有，每一个同志的私人房间内多多少少都贴有好几张；第一区还把画片积压了，没发至乡，该区交通员以为是不发的，就拿到自己房里补墙洞，贴在桌面和挂衣服处；第十一区的五榕乡在一个房子里把广东省人民政府零壹贰号关于护林防火的规定的大张布告和民主妇联编印的“鸳鸯银”大张宣传画（寡妇自由结婚的故事）等，都重复贴在一起；三寨乡把民主妇联编印的“婚姻法图解”也重复贴在乡政府内墙上。
    这些宣传画没有广泛深入下去与群众见面，却停留在区政府、乡政府、甚至私人房间里，这是多么的不负责任，多么的浪费啊！
    我建议上级领导机关印发宣传画时要掌握数量，适当分配，明确指示宣传要点和张贴办法，并订定制度，及时检查；区、乡政府要严肃地重视宣传画，最好在各村设置贴宣传画的专栏，并设专人负责管理，加意保护，如能采用活贴办法，在各处轮流张挂则更好，必要时还可组织宣传员，讲解图画内容，收集群众反映。使每一张宣传画能充分发挥它的宣传教育作用。
