According to the Gansu Daily: Gansu Province, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, conducted a model selection work from January to April. The Gansu provincial-level organs and the Northwest District stationed in Lanzhou organs selected a total of 27 model instructors and 130 model students. Each special district also selected a number of model instructors and model students. Before the selection, many organs explained the purpose and conditions for selecting models, submitted them to all comrades for deliberation, and submitted lists in groups. These were discussed and approved at the cadre meeting of the organs, and then the opinions were put forward by the sub-study committees, and finally reviewed and approved by the general study committee. After the selection, each special district convened a special district-level organ cadre meeting to reward the model instructors and model students. Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, Vice Chairman Huo Weide, and Ruan Dimin, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, all attended the provincial and Northwest District stationed in Lanzhou organs' award ceremony for model instructors and model students, and gave instructions on learning issues at the meeting.

The main gain of this model selection work is actually a learning appraisal for all comrades, and at the same time, a more comprehensive inspection of the learning situation of each unit, correcting some comrades' wrong attitudes towards learning, stipulating strict learning systems and disciplines, and changing the backward state of learning. Some comrades who have consistently been lax in their studies have also begun to consciously examine themselves and expressed their determination to study hard. For example, Qi Guoquan, a comrade from the Jiuquan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, used to have a perfunctory attitude towards learning, but now he has corrected his attitude and proposed to learn from the models. Some instructors who did not pay attention to tutoring work in the past have also changed their past laissez-faire attitude, and the leading group has formulated plans, covenants, and improved the learning system. Many comrades who were elected as model instructors and model students have now become the leading backbone of learning in various units. For example, the Jiuquan Prefectural Commissioner's Office recommended a model student who also serves as the secretary of the sub-study committee. He works actively and is determined to find ways to improve the learning of his unit.

    甘肃进行模范辅导员和学习模范评选工作
    据甘肃日报消息：甘肃全省自一月到四月在省委领导下进行了一次评选模范的工作。甘肃省级机关及西北区驻兰州机关共选出模范辅导员二十七名，学习模范一百三十名。各专区亦选出一批模范辅导员和学习模范。在评选以前，许多机关都讲解了评选模范的目的和条件，交由全体同志酝酿，以小组为单位提出名单，在机关干部大会上讨论通过，再由分学委会提出意见，最后由总学委会审定。评选结束后，各专区都召开了专区级机关干部大会，对模范辅导员和学习模范进行了奖励。省人民政府邓宝珊主席、霍维德副主席、省委宣传部副部长阮迪民同志都参加了省级及西北区驻兰州机关奖励模范辅导员和学习模范大会，并在会上对学习问题作了指示。
    这次评选模范的工作的主要收获，实际上是对全体同志进行了一次学习鉴定，同时对各单位的学习情况进行了一次较全面的检查，端正了一些同志对待学习的错误态度，规定了严格的学习制度和纪律，改变了学习中的落后状态。某些在学习中一贯松懈的同志，也开始自觉地检查，并表示决心要努力学好。如酒泉专署齐国全同志以往对学习抱着应付态度，现在端正了态度，并提出向模范学习；一些过去不重视辅导工作的辅导员，也改变了过去的放任自流态度，领导小组订计划，订公约，健全学习制度。许多当选为模范辅导员、学习模范的同志，现在都已成为各单位学习的领导骨干。如酒泉专署推荐了一个学习模范兼任分学委会秘书，他工作积极，决心想办法把本单位的学习搞好。
