The World Federation of Trade Unions held a reception at the Peace Hotel in Beijing on the evening of the 11th to entertain trade union delegations and trade union representatives from various countries who were invited to China to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as well as Chinese trade union representatives.

Those invited included trade union delegations and trade union representatives from twenty-one countries including the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, India, Australia, Ceylon, North Korea, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Burma, Poland, Indonesia, France, Japan, Mongolia, and Africa.

Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech at the beginning of the reception. He first expressed his gratitude and welcome to all the guests on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He thanked the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for assisting in organizing this banquet and enabling trade union representatives from various countries to gather here. He thanked the representatives of those trade union organizations that had not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions for participating in this gathering. Louis Saillant then spoke about the Third World Trade Union Congress to be convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions. He pointed out the importance of strengthening the united action of the working class in the struggle to defend peace, defend workers' rights, end the colonial system, and eliminate imperialism. Louis Saillant said: The working classes of all countries demand further strengthening of the struggle to defend peace and improve living standards. Such efforts can be made and steps should be taken to realize them, and this will be one of the tasks of the Third World Trade Union Congress. The authority and strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions make it responsible for convening the Third World Trade Union Congress and pointing out the road and direction to trade union organizations in various countries. This call by the World Federation of Trade Unions has been echoed by millions of working people. The World Federation of Trade Unions warmly hopes that all trade union organizations, whether or not they have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, will accept the invitation of the World Federation of Trade Unions to participate in the Third World Trade Union Congress. Louis Saillant said: The World Federation of Trade Unions recently wrote to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions requesting united action, precisely in order to strengthen the unity of the world's working class. Louis Saillant pointed out: This letter was written based on this: The recent International Social Security Conference adopted an insurance plan, which shows the possibility of united action by the international working class to improve living conditions. At this conference, 266 representatives from 59 countries participated, including many trade union representatives who had not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions. This proves that united action is possible. Louis Saillant said: The broad masses of people support this social insurance plan, and now it must be put into practice. There is no true unity without the participation of the masses. And only when trade unions are strongly linked to the masses can there be solid trade union activities. He called for united action to realize this plan.

During the reception, the head of the Soviet trade union delegation, Goroshkin, the Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Lai Ruoyu, as well as the Vice Chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Yusuf, the head of the Indonesian Trade Union delegation, Zhu Yiduo, the Chairman of the Indian Labor Association, Sibu Nath Banerjee, and others successively delivered speeches, expressing their determination to strive for the unity of the world labor movement. Trade union representatives from various countries also raised their glasses to congratulate the development and growth of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to congratulate the unity and solidarity of the working classes of various countries, and to congratulate the great unity of the world's workers.

The reception was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and solidarity from beginning to end.

    世界工联招待各国工会代表
    【新华社十一日讯】世界工会联合会十一日晚在北京和平宾馆举行酒会，招待应邀前来我国参加“五一”国际劳动节和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的各国工会代表团和工会代表及中国的工会代表。
    应邀参加的有：苏联、中国、越南、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、印度、澳大利亚、锡兰、朝鲜、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、缅甸、波兰、印度尼西亚、法国、日本、蒙古、非洲等地二十一个国家的工会代表团和工会代表。
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬在酒会开始时致词，他首先代表世界工会联合会对全体来宾表示感谢和欢迎，他感谢中华全国总工会协助组织这次宴会和使各国工会代表能在此地聚会，他感谢那些没有参加世界工联的工会组织的代表参加这次集会。路易·赛扬接着谈到关于世界工联召开的世界工会第三次代表大会，他指出在保卫和平、保卫工人权利、终止殖民制度和杜绝帝国主义的道路的斗争中加强工人阶级一致行动的重要性。路易·赛扬说：各国工人阶级都要求进一步加强保卫和平与改善生活的斗争，这样的努力是可以作到的，是应该采取步骤来实现的，而将是世界工会第三次代表大会的任务之一。世界工会联合会所具有的权威和力量，使它有责任来召开世界工会第三次代表大会，向各国工会组织指出道路和方向。世界工联的这一号召已获得了千百万劳动人民的响应，世界工联热烈地希望一切不论已否参加世界工联的工会组织，接受世界工联的邀请参加世界工会第三次代表大会。路易·赛扬说：世界工会联合会最近写信给国际自由工会联合会要求采取一致行动，就是为了加强世界工人阶级的团结。路易·赛扬指出：这封信是根据这件事写的：最近举行的国际社会保险会议曾通过一个保险计划，这表明国际工人阶级为改善生活条件而采取一致行动的可能性。在这个会议上，有五十九个国家的二百六十六位代表参加，其中就有许多工会代表是没有参加世界工联的。这就证明了采取一致行动是可能的。路易·赛扬说：广大的人民群众都拥护这个社会保险计划，现在必须把它付诸实现。没有群众参加就没有真正的统一。而只有工会坚强地和群众联系起来才能有牢固的工会活动。他号召为实现这个计划而采取一致行动。
    席间，苏联工会代表团团长戈罗希金、中华全国总工会秘书长赖若愚，以及全印工会大会副主席优素福、印尼总工会代表团团长朱义多、印度劳工协会主席西布纳特·班纳吉等相继致辞，表示要为世界工人运动的统一而奋斗。各国工会代表并举杯祝贺世界工会联合会的发展和壮大，祝贺各国工人阶级的统一和团结，祝贺世界工人大团结。
    酒会自始至终洋溢着友好团结的空气。
