Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Inspection by the People's Government of Xidan District, Beijing, on the Work of Receiving Visitors
    Letter from the People's Government of Xidan District, Beijing: After reading the article "Suggestion to the People's Government of Xidan District, Beijing, to Attach Importance to the Work of Receiving Visitors" published in the People's Daily on March 22nd, we immediately conducted an inspection. The inspection results proved that the situation reflected by comrades Ji Xiaode and Jiang Qi basically conformed to the facts. During holidays, our district's various departments stipulated that on-duty personnel were responsible for handling temporary major issues, and there was no regulation of "only answering the phone and not working." Now, administratively, it has been decided to give the comrades who made mistakes a demerit as a form of education for all staff. Of course, the mistakes made by the communications team this time are inseparable from our usual lack of education for the communications team and lack of inspection of the work. We have also decided that in the future, the work and study of the communications team will be led by a dedicated person in the secretary's office, and meetings will be held regularly to inspect the work. In addition, because the mistake of the communications team this time was related to various departments, a meeting of the heads of various departments was also convened to check the situation of our district's cadres in receiving visitors in conjunction with the communications team's problem, and the responsibilities of the on-duty personnel were clearly defined.

    Reply from the Ministry of Culture on Coordinating Basic Construction and Protecting Cultural Relics
    Letter from the General Office of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government: The suggestion made by reader Liu Longkai in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on March 28th regarding "Attention should be paid to the protection of cultural relics in basic construction work" is correct and pertinent. The Social Culture Affairs Bureau of our ministry has listed the work of coordinating basic construction projects to protect and clear ancient sites, ancient tombs, ancient buildings, and ancient cultural relics discovered within the scope of the projects as the central task of the cultural relics management committees of all provinces and cities across the country; at the same time, we are contacting relevant departments to make necessary arrangements. On March 31st, the Central Ministry of Light Industry issued a notice to all departments under its jurisdiction, pointing out that "When carrying out basic construction, if buildings and underground cultural relics of historical value are found, they should be contacted with the Central Social Culture Affairs Bureau at any time and attention should be paid to protection." The Central Social Culture Affairs Bureau has jointly conducted the cleaning and excavation of a large number of ancient tombs discovered in the construction of the Luoyang area with the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Henan Provincial People's Government. The East China Administrative Committee has also formed a "East China Cultural Relics Work Team" specifically responsible for coordinating the protection of cultural relics and historical sites discovered in the region's projects. The Southwest Region has also established a work team to protect cultural relics in coordination with the construction of Tiancheng Road. The Cultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee also notified the local cultural relics authorities in the region on April 7th to cooperate with the local project leading organs to extensively publicize relevant cultural relics laws and policies to basic construction personnel and local people. In March, the Shanxi Provincial Government also issued instructions to governments at all levels in the province that "Ancient cultural relics excavated from construction sites should be effectively protected to prevent damage."

    Although the central and regional governments have made the above arrangements, they still cannot meet the requirements of doing a good job in protecting cultural relics in comprehensive construction projects. It is hoped that governments at all levels, the vast number of cadres and the masses, with the spirit of cherishing the cultural heritage of the motherland's people, will inform the local people's government or the Central Social Culture Affairs Bureau of the discovery and destruction of ancient cultural heritage on the ground and underground in various regions at any time, and assist the government in ensuring that all discovered cultural relics and historical sites can receive the necessary protection and appropriate treatment.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    北京市西单区人民政府对接见人民来访工作的检查
    北京市西单区人民政府来信：我们读到三月二十二日人民日报刊载的“建议北京市西单区人民政府重视接见人民来访工作”一文后，立即作了检查。检查结果，证明吉效德、江圻二同志反映的情况基本上是符合事实的。放假日我区各科本规定值班人负责处理临时的重大问题，而并无“只管接电话，不办公”的规定。现在，行政上决定给犯错误的同志以记过处分，以教育全体工作人员。当然，通讯班这次所犯的错误，是与我们平时对通讯班缺乏教育、对工作缺乏检查分不开的。我们还决定，今后由秘书室专人领导通讯班的工作和学习，并定期开会检查工作。另外，因为通讯班这一次的错误和各科室有关，所以又召开了各科室负责人的会议，结合通讯班的问题检查了我区干部接待人民来访工作的情况，并明确规定了值班人员的责任。
    中央文化部关于配合基本建设做好文物保护工作的答复
    中央人民政府文化部办公厅来信：三月二十八日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者刘隆凯关于“在基本建设工作中应该重视保护文物”的建议是正确的、切要的。我部社会文化事业管理局已将配合基本建设工程做好保护和清理在工程范围内发现的古遗址、古墓葬、古建筑、古文物的工作，列为全国各省市文物管理委员会的中心任务；同时正在与各有关部门联系作必要的布置。中央轻工业部在三月三十一日已对该部所属各部门发出通知，指出“在进行基本建设时，如发现有历史价值的建筑物及地下文物、应随时与中央社会文化事业管理局联系，注意保护”。中央社会文化事业管理局并已联合中国科学院考古研究所与河南省人民政府共同进行了洛阳区在建设中发现的大批古代墓葬的清理发掘工作。华东行政委员会也组成了“华东文物工作队”，专门负责配合该区工程进行中所发现的文物、古迹的保护工作。西南区配合天成路的建设也成立了保护文物的工作队。东北行政委员会文化局在四月七日也通知了该区各地文物机关协同当地工程领导机关布置对基本建设人员和当地群众广泛进行有关文物法令政策的宣传。山西省政府在三月也对该省各级政府发出了“对工地发掘出土的古文物应切实保护防止破坏”的指示。
    中央及各地区政府虽作了如上的布置，但仍不能满足在全面建设工程中做好保护文物的要求。希望各级政府，广大干部和群众共同以爱护祖国人民文化遗产的精神，随时将各地区地上、地下古代文化遗产的发现和破坏的情况告知当地人民政府或中央社会文化事业管理局，并协助政府使所有发现的文物古迹均能得到必要的保护和适当的处理。
