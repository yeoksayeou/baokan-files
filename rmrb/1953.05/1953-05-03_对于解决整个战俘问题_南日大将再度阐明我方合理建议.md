    Regarding the Resolution of the Entire Prisoner of War Issue
    General Nam Il Reiterates Our Reasonable Proposals
    Communique of the Korean-Chinese Delegation on April 30th
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 30th] The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued the following communique on April 30th:

    The delegations of both sides held a meeting on April 30th.

    At the meeting, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out: Our side has made repeated concessions and various constructive efforts in resolving the entire prisoner of war issue. However, the problem cannot be solved by one party's efforts alone, and it is hoped that the other side will put forward positive opinions.

    However, at the April 30th meeting, the other side not only failed to put forward any positive opinions, but also brought up unfounded issues that could only hinder the progress of the negotiations, resulting in the failure of the April 30th plenary meeting of the two delegations to achieve any progress. General Nam Il said in his speech at the April 30th meeting:

    "Our proposal to hand over the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice to neutral countries is in itself a clear concession to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue, which has been recognized by the world. The specific implementation plan proposed by our side also takes into account the three specific suggestions in your letter of April 16th. Our specific implementation plan adopts your views in the three specific suggestions of April 16th on the issue of time limit and final disposition, and puts forward the reasonable suggestions of a six-month stay in a neutral country and submitting the final disposition to a political conference. Since your side believes that the time spent in the neutral country is too long, we have made concessions and stated that the time limit can be discussed. We also specifically suggested that in order to send the prisoners of war there, both sides should agree on a neutral Asian country. As for the specific nomination issue, since this involves a specific neutral country, in order to show respect for this neutral country that should be agreed upon by both sides, our side believes that it is only convenient to conduct specific consultations on the neutral country nomination issue after both sides have agreed on the principle of sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country for accommodation.

    Our side has made these constructive efforts to seek a solution to the problem, but your side has not made any substantial efforts. It is very clear that only by sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides can a fair solution be achieved to their repatriation problem, because only in a neutral country agreed upon by both sides will there be no issue of forced detention, and naturally there will be no issue of so-called forced repatriation. However, your side initially objected to sending prisoners of war to neutral countries on the grounds of practical difficulties in arrangements, and now on the pretext of 'using force to send prisoners of war to neutral countries.' We believe that this excuse is untenable. Because the prisoners of war held by your side are under your control and influence, if the detaining party does not want to use its position and influence as a long-term detainee to detain prisoners of war, there is no legitimate reason to object to sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country. We believe that sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country and submitting the possible final disposition issue to a political conference for resolution is the most reasonable way to resolve the current dispute.

    In order to achieve the Korean armistice, our side is willing to work hard to find a solution to the problem. However, the problem cannot be solved by one party's efforts alone, and the problem can only be solved through the joint efforts of both sides. Your side also expressed its willingness to achieve the Korean armistice as soon as possible, but our side has not yet seen any equal guarantees from your side regarding the current points of contention between the two sides."

    In its speech at the meeting, the other party claimed that Asian countries are under the military, economic, and political influence of countries under so-called communist control regarding our proposal to send prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral Asian country, and still opposed sending prisoners of war to a neutral country on the pretext of "using force to send prisoners of war to a neutral country." At the same time, the other party further demanded that our side agree to the other party's proposal to "release" the Korean prisoners of war in the other party's prisoner of war camps who supposedly "do not want to return home" on the spot, which is actually forced detention. General Nam Il pointed out that these statements by the other party were obviously not made to solve the problem. The two sides are scheduled to continue the plenary meeting of the two delegations at 11:00 a.m. on May 1st.

    Communique of the Korean-Chinese Delegation on May 1st
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 1st] The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued the following communique on May 1st:

    The delegations of both sides held a meeting on May 1st. At the meeting, our chief representative, General Nam Il, clearly pointed out: Sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides is the most reasonable way to resolve the dispute between the two sides on the prisoner of war repatriation issue. General Nam Il also pointed out: Under the premise of this most reasonable method, our side has expressed that our side is prepared to propose an Asian neutral country to discuss with the other side. In order to show respect for a neutral country that should be agreed upon by both sides, our side believes that the discussion of specific neutral country nominations should be entered after both sides agree to the above-mentioned principle of sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country.

    However, at the May 1st meeting, the other party still opposed sending the prisoners of war who had not been directly repatriated from the area controlled by the detaining party to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides, and insisted on entering into the discussion of specific neutral countries before the two sides had reached an agreement on the above-mentioned principle. Therefore, the plenary meeting of the two delegations on May 1st did not make any progress.

    The two sides are scheduled to continue the plenary meeting of the delegations at 11:00 a.m. on May 2nd.

    The full text of General Nam Il's main speech at the May 1st meeting is as follows: "Under the premise of sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated after the armistice to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides, we have expressed our willingness to propose a neutral Asian country to discuss with your side. Your side's comments on our expression yesterday did not help the progress of the negotiations. Our side fully agrees that the countries that make up the neutral nations supervisory commission that has been agreed upon by both parties are neutral countries. However, our side believes that under the premise of sending prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country, only neutral Asian countries can be reasonable and practical. In order to show respect for a neutral country to be agreed upon by both sides, our side still maintains that after both sides agree to the principle of sending prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country, the discussion of specific neutral country nominations should be entered. We do not see how the nomination of this neutral country can be seriously discussed before the issue of sending prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country has been resolved.

    Sending the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated to a neutral country, and letting the side to which they belong explain to them to eliminate their fears, is the most reasonable way to resolve the dispute between the two sides on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war. Only in a neutral country outside the Korean battlefield can prisoners of war gradually get rid of the influence of long-term detention, return to a normal state, and happily return to their motherland and hometown. We cannot understand why your side has placed unreasonable restrictions on our nominations, but is unwilling to send prisoners of war from the area controlled by the detaining party to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides. We believe that sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides, and letting the relevant party explain to them so that they can happily return to their motherland and hometown, is the most humane approach. Making it impossible for them to do so is the most inhumane. If this is done, it is difficult to imagine that there will still be prisoners of war under the supervision of neutral countries after a certain period of time. Even so, taking into account your side's opinions, our side still suggests that this possible problem be submitted to a political conference for resolution. We believe that this is fair, reasonable, and beyond reproach, and we adhere to this position.

    After your side claimed that our proposal to hand over prisoners of war who had not been directly repatriated to neutral countries was "appropriately recognized," your side took a step back in yesterday's speech and put forward the argument of releasing prisoners of war who had not been directly repatriated on the spot in the area of the detaining party after the armistice. This was obviously not to promote the progress of the meeting, and such a retrograde attitude also fundamentally violated your side's repeatedly suggested desire to achieve the Korean armistice as soon as possible. The negotiations between the two sides can only make progress based on the spirit of mutual concession and joint efforts. In order to achieve the Korean armistice that the world desires, our side is still prepared to negotiate with your side in this spirit. Our side is willing to listen to any positive opinions from your side."

    Communique of the Korean-Chinese Delegation on May 2nd
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 2nd] The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued the following communique on May 2nd:

    At the May 2nd plenary meeting of the delegations, our chief representative, General Nam Il, spoke first. General Nam Il said: "Your side mentioned the procedural issue of the current negotiations in yesterday's speech. According to the nature of the problem, our side believes that the procedure of the negotiations should be to first determine that prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated will be sent to a neutral country, and then determine the specific nomination of the neutral country. Your side knows that under the premise that prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated will be sent to a neutral country, our side is prepared to nominate an Asian neutral country. Your side proposed yesterday that in addition to Switzerland, your side is also willing to consider Sweden. I would like to point out again that our side fully agrees that the member states of the neutral nations supervisory commission agreed upon by both sides are neutral countries, but the essence of the problem is that under the principle of sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country, it is obviously impractical to send them to distant Europe. We believe that this is a truth understood by neutral countries. The neutral countries agreed upon by both sides that make up the neutral nations supervisory commission, in addition to Switzerland and Sweden, also include Poland and Czechoslovakia. Does your side agree to send prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, and Czechoslovakia? Under the premise of sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country, our side advocates that both sides agree on a neutral Asian country. Your side said that a neutral Asian country is inappropriate. Our side cannot agree with this statement. There are many neutral countries in Asia, such as India, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, etc. Can your side say that these neutral countries are inappropriate? Your side requested our side to nominate a specific neutral country. It is not that our side is unwilling to specifically nominate this neutral country, but our side believes that it is inappropriate to enter into specific nominations before the principle of sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country is determined. If our side proposes a neutral country to which prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated are sent to accommodate, but your side refuses to determine the principle of sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country, wouldn't this put the nominated neutral country in an embarrassing situation? Therefore, our side advocates that both sides should first determine the principle of sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country."

    "Regarding the issue of sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country, your side has not put forward any tenable reasons to oppose it. For the progress of the negotiations, we advocate immediately determining the principle of sending prisoners of war who will not be directly repatriated to a neutral country, and I am willing to listen to any constructive opinions from your side."

    At the meeting, the other party continued to oppose sending prisoners of war who would not be directly repatriated from the area controlled by the detaining party to a neutral country agreed upon by both sides on the pretext of so-called unnecessary travel. General Nam Il immediately pointed out: The other party has not made any efforts to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue in its speech on May 2nd, and hopes that the other party will make such efforts in future negotiations.

    The two sides are scheduled to continue the plenary meeting of the delegations at 11:00 a.m. on May 4th.

    对于解决整个战俘问题
    南日大将再度阐明我方合理建议
    朝中代表团四月三十日公报
    【新华社开城四月三十日电】　朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团四月三十日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团四月三十日举行会议。
    我方首席代表南日大将在会上指出：我方已在解决整个战俘问题上作了一再的让步和各种建设性的努力。但问题不是单凭一方的努力所能解决，希望对方提出积极性的意见。
    但对方在四月三十日的会上，不但未提出任何积极性的意见，而且节外生枝地提出了显然只能是阻碍谈判的进展的无中生有的问题，以致使四月三十日的双方代表团大会未能获得任何进展。南日大将在四月三十日会上的发言中说：
      “我方所提出的将停战后未被直接遣返的战俘送交中立国的建议，本身就是一个为了解决整个战俘问题的明显让步，这一点已经为举世所公认。我方所提出的具体实施方案也考虑了你方四月十六日来信的三点具体建议。我方具体实施方案在期限问题和最后处理问题上采纳了你方四月十六日三点具体建议中的观点，提出在中立国停留六个月的期限和将最后处理提交政治会议的合理建议。由于你方认为在中立国停留的时间太长，我们又作了让步，表示期限可以商量。我们并具体建议为了把战俘送去，双方应商定一个亚洲的中立国家。至于具体的提名问题，因为这牵涉到一个具体的中立国家，为了表示对于这一应为双方同意的中立国家的尊重，我方认为只有在双方已经协议确定了将未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个中立国内收容的原则以后，才便于就中立国提名问题进行具体的协商。
    我方为寻求问题的解决作了这些建设性的努力，但你方却未作任何实质的努力。很显然只有将未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个双方同意的中立国去，才能对他们的遣返问题取得公正的解决，因为只有在一个双方同意的中立国里，才不发生强迫扣留的问题，自然更不会发生所谓强迫遣返问题。但你方却始则以实际安排的困难为理由，现在又以‘必须使用强力才能将战俘送到中立国去’的藉口，反对将战俘送到中立国去。我们认为这种藉口是不能成立的。因为你方收容下的战俘就是在你方的控制和影响之下，如果拘留一方不想利用它长期拘留者的地位和影响来扣留战俘，就没有任何正当的理由，反对将未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去。我们认为将未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去，并将可能发生的最后处理问题提交政治会议解决，是解决当前争执的最合理的办法。
    为了实现朝鲜停战，我方是愿意努力寻求问题的解决的。但单凭一方的努力问题是不能解决的，必须双方共同努力才能获致问题的解决。你方也表示愿意早日实现朝鲜停战，但我方至今还看不出你方对目前双方争执之点作双方任何同等的保证。”
    对方在会上的发言，对于我方将未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个亚洲的中立国的建议，竟然声称，亚洲国家系处于所谓共产党控制下的国家的军事经济与政治影响之下者，并仍旧以“必须使用强力才能将战俘送到中立国去”为藉口，反对将战俘送往中立国。同时对方并进而要求我方同意对方就地“释放”而实为强迫扣留对方战俘营中所谓不愿回家的朝鲜籍战俘的建议。南日大将指出，对方这些发言显然不是为了解决问题而提出的。双方定于五月一日上午十一时继续举行双方代表团大会。
    朝中代表团五月一日公报
    【新华社开城一日电】　朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月一日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团五月一日举行会议。会上我方首席代表南日大将明确指出：将未被直接遣返的战俘送到
    一个双方同意的中立国去，是解决双方在战俘遣返问题上的争执的最合理的办法。南日大将并指出：在这一最合理的办法的前提之下，我方已经表示我方准备提出一个亚洲中立国家来和对方商量。为了表示对于应经双方同意的中立国家的尊重，我方认为应该在双方同意了上述将未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个双方同意的中立国的原则后，再进入具体中立国提名的讨论。
    但对方在五月一日会上，仍反对将未被直接遣返的战俘从拘留一方所控制的地区，送到一个经由双方同意的中立国家去，并坚持在双方尚未就上述原则取得协议前，即进入具体中立国的讨论。因此五月一日的双方代表团大会又未获得任何进展。
    双方定于五月二日上午十一时继续举行代表团大会。
    南日大将在五月一日会上的主要发言全文如下：“在将停战后未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个双方同意的中立国去的前提之下，我们已经表示准备提出一个亚洲的中立国家来和你方商量。对于我方的这一表示，你方昨天的评论是无助于谈判的进展的。我方完全同意组成双方已经协议的中立国监察委员会的国家都是中立国家，但我方认为在将未被直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的前提下，只有亚洲的中立国家才能是合理的和实际的。为了表示对于一个应经双方同意的中立国家的尊重，我方仍然主张在双方同意了将未被直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的原则后，再进入具体中立国提名的讨论。我们看不出在双方对于将未被直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的问题解决之前，如何可以认真讨论这个中立国提名的问题。
    将未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个中立国去，由他们的所属一方向他们进行解释，以消除他们的疑惧，是解决双方在战俘遣返问题上的争执的最合理的办法。只有在朝鲜战场以外的一个中立国家里，战俘才能逐渐解脱长期拘留的影响，恢复正常的状态，欣然返回祖国和家乡。我们不能理解，何以你方对我们提名提出了无理的限制，而却不愿将战俘从拘留一方所控制的地区中送到一个经由双方同意的中立国家去。我们认为将不直接遣返的战俘送到双方同意的一个中立国去，由有关一方向其解释，使其欣然返回祖国和家乡，是最人道的办法。使他们没有机会这样做，才是最不人道的。这样做了，就难于设想在一定期限之后，还有在中立国看管之下的战俘。虽然如此，考虑到你方的意见，我方仍然建议将这可能发生的问题交政治会议解决。我们认为这是公平合理无可非议的，我们坚持这个立场。
    在你方声称对于将未被直接遣返的战俘送交中立国的我方建议已予‘适当认可’之后，你方在昨天的发言中竟又后退了一步，提出了将停战后未被直接遣返的战俘在拘留一方的地区内就地释放的论调，这显然不是为了促进会议的进展，而提出的这种倒退的态度，也根本违反了你方所一再建议的早日实现朝鲜停战的意愿。双方的谈判只有本着相互让步、共同努力的精神，才能获得进展。为了实现举世渴望的朝鲜停战，我方仍然准备本着这一精神与你方进行协商。我方愿意听取你方任何积极性的意见。”
    朝中代表团五月二日公报
    【新华社开城二日电】　朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月二日发表公报如下：
    在五月二日双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日大将首先发言。南日大将说：“你方在昨天的发言中提到目前谈判的程序问题。根据问题的性质，我方认为谈判的程序应该是首先确定将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的境内，然后确定中立国的具体提名。你方知道在将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的前提下，我方准备提名一个亚洲中立国家，你方昨天提出除了瑞士以外，你方也愿意考虑瑞典。对此我愿意再次指出，我方完全同意组成双方同意的中立国监察委员会的成员国家都是中立国家，但问题的实质在于将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的原则下，把他们送到辽远的欧洲去，显然是不实际的。我们以为这是中立国明白的道理。组成中立国监察委员会的双方同意的中立国家，除了瑞士、瑞典还有波兰、捷克斯洛伐克，你方同意将不直接遣返的战俘送到瑞士、瑞典、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克去吗？在将不直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去的前提下，我方主张双方商定一个亚洲中立国家，你方说亚洲的中立国家是不适当的。我方不能同意这种说法。亚洲有很多中立国家，例如印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦等，你方能说这些中立国家是不适当的吗？你方要求我方提名一个具体的中立国家。我们不是不愿意具体提名这一个中立国家，但我方认为当将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的原则确定之前，即进入具体提名是不适当的。如果我方提了一个将不直接遣返的战俘送去收容的中立国家，而你方却拒绝确定将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的原则，这不是叫这个被提名的中立国家处于为难的境地吗？因此，我方主张双方应该首先确定将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的原则”。 
    “关于将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的问题，你方没有提出任何站得住的理由来反对。为了谈判的进展，我们主张立即确定将不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的原则，我愿意听取你方任何建设性的意见。”
    对方在会上，以所谓不必要的旅途跋涉为藉口，继续反对将不直接遣返的战俘从拘留一方所控制的地区送到一个经由双方同意的中立国家去。南日大将当即指出：对方在五月二日的发言中，又未对解决整个战俘问题作任何努力，希望对方在今后的谈判中作这种努力。
    双方定于五月四日上午十一时，继续举行代表团大会。
