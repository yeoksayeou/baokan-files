    On the Battlefront of National Economic Construction

    New Port of Tanggu's This Year's Project Has Commenced
    This year's project for the New Port of Tanggu has already commenced, with thousands upon thousands of tons of building materials piled up near the port's wharf. In the navigation channel, the red flags on the dredgers flutter in the sea breeze, and more than two thousand employees throughout the port have launched a heated competition. The workers participating in the reinforcement of the breakwater project are continuously improving efficiency. The Liu Minglou sand transport team created a new record of five tons of sand per vehicle, exceeding the plan by one-fold. The Qi Zhaolin and Zhang Wanlin team increased the transport of rubble from twelve to twenty pieces per hour.
    The main task of the New Port of Tanggu this year is to maintain the navigability of the channel. In order to strengthen the breakwater equipment and prevent siltation, preparations are being made to construct more than seven thousand cubic meters of granite blocks and to dump seven thousand cubic meters of stone. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of domestic and foreign trade, two large warehouses will be built, and concrete pavement will be laid in the open-air cargo yard. Drainage equipment of more than two thousand meters in length will be installed at the first wharf.

    Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine Will Produce Coal on "July 1st"
    The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine in Fuxin, a large-scale modernized open-pit coal mine newly built in our country, will officially produce coal on this year's Party's birthday - "July 1st."
    The coal seam of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine is more than sixty meters thick, and its coal production by 1955 will be equal to the total output of all mines under the Fuxin Mining Bureau. At present, various projects of this mine are being stepped up. Eleven major projects, such as signal installation, railway laying, wiring, and drainage ditches, have commenced successively around April 15.
    This large-scale project has received attention and support from all sides. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Northeast Coal Mining Administration have sent people to inspect the work and help with construction. Soviet experts have also personally inspected the site and provided many valuable opinions. When the open-pit mine lacked draftsmen, various departments and mines of the Fuxin Mining Bureau actively drew draftsmen to support them. For example, the Xinqiu Mine originally had very few draftsmen, but they still unhesitatingly drew three draftsmen to support the open-pit mine. Brother factories and mines across the country have also actively supported the open-pit mine. For example, the Fushun Mine and the Kailuan Mine have allocated necessary mechanical equipment to the open-pit mine; in March, Chongqing Factory 101 transported 23 kilometers of steel rails.
    Zhang Mingshan's New Creation
    Since Zhang Mingshan's successful creation of the anti-overturning device, the small mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has automated the operation of rolling round steel above sixteen millimeters. However, the production of twelve-millimeter round steel still requires manual tongs. This year, the state has begun large-scale capital construction and needs this kind of round steel very much, so the task of producing twelve-millimeter round steel has greatly increased. No matter how tired the workers are, they cannot complete the task. Everyone is very worried that it will affect the capital construction work.
    In order to solve this key problem, Zhang Mingshan, together with the automation team, researched and developed a double-hole anti-overturning device for rolling twelve-millimeter round steel. The workers of the repair section, in order to present a gift to the "May 1st" International Labor Day and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, began to rush to make this anti-overturning device in April. The experiment was conducted on April 30th. When the machine started, the double-hole anti-overturning device for twelve millimeters automatically pressed out twelve-millimeter round steel. The workers were so happy that they applauded and said, "The May 1st gift has been realized!" "We can guarantee to complete the task in the future!"
    Anshan Steel's Employees Returning from Studying in the Soviet Union
    The large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe mill newly built by Anshan Iron and Steel Company are all automated equipment. In the past, very few people in China understood its performance and operating technology. In order to master these machines, Anshan Iron and Steel Company drew a large number of excellent rolling steel workers, technicians, and managers from various rolling mills to study in the Soviet Union. During the eight months of study, Soviet comrades enthusiastically taught them various advanced technologies and methods of managing automated factories.
    On April 18th, they returned to Anshan full of learning achievements. Lu Dexin, Zhang Fuchun, Cao Yongheng and other piercing machine team members discussed and formulated a work plan after returning home during the journey. They unanimously proposed: 1. To teach other workers the knowledge they learned in the Soviet Union. 2. To learn from the workers installing the machines in order to be familiar with the equipment and facilitate future repairs. 3. To learn from Soviet experts and conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. When they arrived at the steel capital of the motherland and saw the seamless steel pipe mill under construction, they were even more excited, and their confidence and determination to build the motherland became even stronger. These days, they have all returned to their work posts to familiarize themselves with the situation and jointly inspect the machinery and equipment with the installation workers.
    Shanghai Workers Strongly Support Anshan Steel
    Shanghai workers strongly support the construction of our country's steel capital - Anshan Iron and Steel Company. From June of last year to now, more than one hundred factories have successively produced more than one thousand kinds of equipment and materials for Anshan Steel. Some of the equipment and materials have been operating with the commissioning of Anshan Steel's first automated No. 8 blast furnace, and some have been installed in the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe mill under construction.
    Anshan Steel's new construction projects all adopt the latest Soviet designs, so many of the equipment and materials supplied by Shanghai must also be manufactured according to Soviet standards. The state-owned Shanghai Wire Factory produced 600 li of operating cables and power cables for Anshan Steel, including more than 60 types, the large ones being two or three inches in diameter, all of which are Soviet specifications, and the factory workers have never seen them before. However, the employees of the wire factory bravely accepted the glorious task of manufacturing these many new products. As a result, the cables manufactured, the physical properties, voltage, conductivity, etc., all met Soviet specifications, and the safe current (maximum transmission capacity) was close to the Soviet level. Workers at the Xin'an Electric Motor Factory manufactured many sets of oil switches for Anshan Steel for automatic control power supply safety. In order to ensure quality, more than 200 technical operation improvements were specially implemented, making the oil switches faster and better.
    Recently, the task of manufacturing all the Soviet-style automated skylights for Anshan Steel's seamless steel pipe mill and large-scale rolling mill was assigned to Huadong Iron and Steel Company. After accepting this task, they solved the difficulties of materials from all aspects and guaranteed to deliver all the goods before the end of May. Other companies such as Shanghai Steel Window Factory also actively completed Anshan Steel's orders. Therefore, many factories have gloriously received banners sent by Anshan Steel.
    Shenyang and Xi'an Establish Construction Site Cultural Service Teams
    Shenyang City has established a cultural army to serve capital construction, preparing to organize forces in a planned way to perform for capital construction workers, help workers carry out cultural activities, and establish literary and artistic organizations. The Northeast Library participating in this work has prepared 15,000 popular books, and the Municipal Library has prepared 6,000 books and periodicals specifically for loan by various construction sites. The Municipal Bureau of Culture, the Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have prepared three film projection teams to tour and screen films at construction sites. Cultural centers in various districts have organized twelve amateur drama troupes, eight slide projection teams, four mobile painting stations, and two mobile photo teams to perform and exhibit at construction sites. The Workers' Station of the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station is preparing to establish a construction site broadcasting station to carry out propaganda and mobilization work specifically for capital construction workers. More than 50 artists from the Municipal Opera Association have voluntarily signed up to participate in performances at construction sites. The Municipal Drama Troupe has decided to organize a construction site singing group to rehearse short programs and tour and perform at construction sites. Xi'an City has established a capital construction cultural service team, going deep into construction sites to tour and perform and provide guidance to workers' literary and artistic activities. This cultural service team is divided into performance and guidance groups. The main tasks of the performance group are to screen films and slides, perform dramas and folk arts, and on average, each construction site can screen a film or perform a drama once a week. The main tasks of the guidance group are to focus on establishing broadcasting stations, reading newspaper groups, mobile book boxes or small libraries, exhibit pictures, and assist the construction site trade union cultural and educational committees in organizing workers' literary and artistic activities.
    The comrades of the first guidance group who conducted guidance at the 362 construction site used meal times to tell crosstalk and clapper talks to the workers, held Soviet film exhibitions, organized correspondents to run blackboards well, distributed more than 400 picture books and popular reading materials to the workers' dormitories, established broadcasting stations, and organized drama troupes, singing, and sports teams, which were warmly welcomed by the workers.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    塘沽新港今年度工程已动工
    塘沽新港今年度工程已经动工，新港码头附近已经堆上成千成百吨的建筑器材。在航道里，挖泥船上的红旗迎着海风招展，全港二千多职工展开了热烈的竞赛。参加加固防波堤工程的工人们不断提高效率。刘铭楼运砂小组创造了每车运沙五吨的新纪录，超过计划一倍。齐兆林、张万林小组运料石由每小时十二块增加到二十块。
    塘沽新港今年度的工程主要是维护航道通航。为了加强防波堤的设备，使泥沙不致回淤，准备做七千多立方公尺的花岗条石方块，还要抛石七千立方公尺。同时，为了适应国内外贸易的需要，将修建两座宽大的仓库，并在露天货场铺设水泥路面，在第一码头安装二千多公尺长的排水设备。

    阜新海州露天矿将在“七一”出煤
    我国新建设的一个巨大的近代化露天煤矿——阜新海州露天矿，将要在今年党的生日——“七一”正式生产出煤。
    海州露天矿的煤层有六十多公尺厚，它的产煤量到一九五五年将等于现在阜新矿务局全局各矿产量的总和。现在这个矿的各项工程正在加紧进行中。信号安装、铁道铺设、架线、排水沟等十一件主要工程，都在四月十五日前后陆续开工。
    这个规模宏大的工程受到了各方面的重视和支援。中央燃料工业部和东北煤矿管理局都派人来检查工作和帮助施工。苏联专家也亲自来视察，提供了很多宝贵意见。露天矿缺少描图员，阜新矿务局的各处和各矿就积极地抽出描图员给他们。如新邱矿的描图员本来就很少，可是他们还一点不迟疑地抽出了三名描图员支援露天矿。全国各兄弟厂矿也同样积极地支援露天矿。如抚顺矿、开滦矿都把必要的机械设备拨给了露天矿；三月份，重庆一○一厂又运来了二十三公里的钢轨。
    张明山的新创造
    鞍山钢铁公司小型厂自从张明山创造反围盘成功后，已把轧制十六粍以上圆钢的操作变为自动化了。可是生产十二粍的圆钢，仍然要用人力夹钳。今年国家开始大规模基本建设很需要这种圆钢，因此生产十二粍圆钢的任务大大增加了。工友们无论怎样累，也完不成任务。大家都很担心，怕影响基本建设工作。
    张明山为了解决这个关键问题，又和自动化小组共同研究出一个轧十二粍圆钢的双孔反围盘。修理工段的工友们，为了给“五一”国际劳动节和中国工会第七次全国代表大会献礼，从四月份开始紧张地赶制这个反围盘。到四月三十日进行试验。当机器开动起来不久，十二粍的双孔反围盘自动地压出了十二粍的圆钢。工友们都乐得直鼓掌，说：“五一节的献礼实现啦！”“以后保证能够完成任务！”
    鞍钢赴苏联学习的职工归国
    鞍山钢铁公司新建设起来的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，全部是自动化设备，过去，中国还很少有人懂得它的性能与操作技术。为了掌握这些机器，鞍山钢铁公司由各轧钢厂抽调出大批优秀的轧钢工人、技术人员和管理人员到苏联去学习。在八个月的学习当中，苏联同志热心地把各种先进技术，以及管理自动化工厂的方法，都教给了他们。
    四月十八日，他们满载着学习成果回到了鞍山。卢德新、张福春、曹永恒等穿孔机小组，在归国途中就讨论订好了回国后的工作计划。他们一致提出：一、要把自己在苏联学来的知识教给其他工人。二、要向安装机器的工人学习，以熟悉设备情况，便于今后检修。三、要向苏联专家学习，认真贯彻苏联专家建议。当他们到了祖国的钢都，看见了正在建设的无缝钢管厂，更是兴奋得不得了，建设祖国的信心和决心更加坚定了。这两天，他们都回到了自己的工作岗位去熟悉情况，和安装工人共同检查机器设备。
    上海工人大力支援鞍钢
    上海工人大力支援我国钢都——鞍山钢铁公司的建设。从去年六月到现在，有一百多个工厂已先后为鞍钢生产了一千多种器材和设备。有的器材和设备已随着鞍钢第一座自动化的八号高炉开工生产而运转起来，有的已被安装在正在建设的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂里。
    鞍钢的新建工程都是采用苏联最新式的设计，因此上海供应的许多器材设备也必须按照苏联标准来制造。国营上海电线厂为鞍钢生产的六百华里操作电缆和电力电缆，共包括六十多种，大的直径有两三寸，都是苏联的规格，全厂职工从来没有看到过。但是，电线厂的职工们勇敢地接受了制造这许多新产品的光荣任务。结果，制造出来的电缆、物理性能、电压、导电率等，都合乎苏联规格，安全电流（最高输电能力）也接近于苏联水平。新安电机厂的工人为鞍钢制造许多套自动控制供电安全用的油开关，为了保证质量，专门实行了两百多件技术操作上的改进，使油开关做得又快又好。
    最近，鞍钢无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂全部苏联式自动化天窗的制造任务交给了华东钢铁公司，他们接受这个任务后，从各方面解决材料的困难，保证在五月底以前全部交货。其他如上海钢窗厂等，也都积极地完成鞍钢的订货，因此，有很多工厂都光荣地得到了鞍钢送来的锦旗。
    沈阳西安成立工地文化服务队
    沈阳市成立了一支为基本建设服务的文化大军，准备有计划地组织力量，给基本建设职工演出，和帮助工人开展文化活动，建立文艺组织。参加这一工作的东北图书馆已准备了一万五千册通俗图书，市图书馆准备了六千册书刊专供各工地借阅。市文化局、市中苏友好协会、市总工会准备了三个电影放映队，在工地巡回放映。各区文化馆组织了十二个业余剧团、八个幻灯队、四个流动画站、两个照片流动队，到工地演出和展览。市人民广播电台工人台准备举办工地广播站，专对基本建设职工进行宣传鼓动工作。市戏曲协会艺人自愿报名参加工地演出的已有五十多人。市话剧团决定组织工地演唱小组，排演短小节目，在工地巡回演出。西安市成立了基本建设文化服务队，深入到工地巡回演出和辅导工人的文艺活动。这个文化服务队共分演出、辅导两组。演出组的主要任务是放映电影、幻灯，演出戏剧、曲艺，平均每个工地每星期可以放映一次电影或演一次戏。辅导组的主要任务是有重点地建立广播站、读报组、流动图书箱或小型图书室、展览图片，并协助工地工会文教委员会组织工人的文艺活动。
    在三六二工地进行辅导的第一辅导小组的同志们，利用吃饭时间给工人们说相声、快板，举办苏联影片展览，组织通讯员办好黑板报，把四百多册连环画和通俗读物散发到工人宿舍去，建立广播站，组织剧团、歌咏、球队，受到了工人们的热烈欢迎。
