　　In preparing for festival activities, all localities are paying close attention to checking children's health and strengthening children's education and childcare work. Chongqing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, and other places, are planning to conduct children's health checks in May, focusing on checking the health of children outside of school. The Anhui Provincial Preparatory Committee for Celebrating "June 1st" requests all parts of the province to widely publicize children's childcare and healthcare work around "June 1st." At the same time, it requires educators, childcare workers, and healthcare workers to work and study better. The Suiyuan Provincial Preparatory Committee for Celebrating "June 1st" requires all localities to invite children's education workers, childcare workers, healthcare workers, and fathers and mothers to hold symposiums based on specific circumstances to discuss strengthening and improving children's education, childcare, and healthcare. The Xiamen Municipal Democratic Women's Federation will convene meetings of mothers' representatives in various districts to promote childcare knowledge to mothers.
　　All localities have formulated various activity plans for celebrating "June 1st" and have arranged a happy festival for the children. In Chongqing, more than 20,000 children will participate in a garden party on "June 1st." Government leaders, labor models, combat heroes, and literary and scientific workers will come to the garden party to congratulate the children. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou are preparing to hold celebration meetings, game meetings, bonfire parties, collective camping, small-scale cultural and sports meetings, and various get-togethers on "June 1st."

People's broadcasting stations in various places will broadcast various children's entertainment programs.
　　Celebration activities in various places will encourage children to study hard and conduct scientific research. Quanzhou is preparing to organize a small-scale science exhibition for children, displaying various object models, toys, handicrafts, and animal and plant specimens made by children. In addition, a special aviation model meeting will be held. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Fuzhou will hold "Children's Creation Exhibition," "Academic Achievement Exhibition," and "Children's Life Picture Exhibition," respectively.

Guangzhou Municipal Children's Palace
    Prepares "June 1st" Activity Programs
　　The Guangzhou Municipal Children's Palace is now busy preparing various programs to allow the children of Guangzhou to happily spend their festival here. Around "June 1st," many combat heroes and labor models will be here to tell the children about their model deeds; performing arts groups will perform various interesting programs for the children here; many excellent young pioneers and elementary school students will exhibit their learning achievements here; and young musicians and dancers are also preparing to perform some wonderful programs here.
　　In this beautiful arc-shaped building located in the Guangzhou Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace, there is a recreation room, a library, a science group activity room, a dance room, and a small auditorium that can accommodate more than 1,000 people. In the library, there are thousands of picture magazines, comic books, and books that children love; in the science group activity room, there are instruments and materials for children to conduct scientific experiments, including electric-powered trains and railway models sent by Guangzhou railway workers, and magnets, radios, airplanes, and steamboats carefully made by the children themselves. Behind the house, there is also a small plot of land for children to plant flowers and vegetables.
　　Young children who regularly come here to participate in activities have organized agriculture, biology, chemistry, physics, dance, singing, sports, and other groups, and instructors guide their activities. They make radios and compasses, grow vegetables and flowers, or dissect rabbits and sparrows. Through these activities, they cultivate children's excellent qualities of loving science and loving labor. Dance groups, singing teams, and sports teams also regularly perform various programs. The Children's Palace also regularly holds various science lectures, speeches, entertainment evenings, and tours for children. During last year's "China-Soviet Friendship Month," Guo Junqing, a female combat hero who had visited the Soviet Union, and young pioneer Lu Qinghua introduced the happy lives of Soviet children to thousands of children. This New Year's Day, the Children's Palace held a grand bonfire party. During the summer and winter vacations, the activities of the Children's Palace are even more numerous.
　　Since its opening last year on "June 1st," the Children's Palace has become the activity center for more than 100,000 elementary school students and 13,000 young pioneers in Guangzhou. Every Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of children come here to participate in various activities; during festivals and holidays, it is even more lively.

Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou on the Eve of "June 1st"
    Prepare to Supply a Large Number of Children's Books
　　Major bookstores and publishing houses in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have prepared a large number of children's books on the eve of "June 1st" International Children's Day to meet the needs of young readers.
　　In Beijing, the Beijing branch of Xinhua Bookstore plans to purchase 363 kinds of children's books and books on children's issues from publishing houses in the city and other places; the Beijing branch of China Book Distribution Company has also purchased 51 kinds of children's books from Shanghai; Youth Publishing House will publish a total of ten kinds of juvenile activity series specializing in guiding juvenile team activities around "June 1st." In order to fully supply children with various books, the Beijing branch of Xinhua Bookstore plans to organize mobile supply stations on "June 1st" to serve children in Beihai Park, Western Suburban Park, Labor People's Cultural Palace, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, and Temple of Heaven. The Beijing branch of International Bookstore is also preparing to sell books introducing the lives of children in various countries at the store's outlets and Zhongshan Park on "June 1st."
　　Shanghai Children's Publishing House is preparing to supply 136 kinds of children's books for the "June 1st" Children's Day, and New Art Publishing House has prepared 20 kinds of children's story comic books. Children's magazines published in Shanghai, such as "Little Friend" and "Children's Era," have all published special issues celebrating "June 1st" Children's Day. The "June 1st" special issue of "Little Friend" magazine was published on the 20th, and the "June 1st" issue of "Children's Era" magazine is being rushed to print. This issue includes photos of Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, Soong Ching Ling, and leaders of various people's democratic countries with children, as well as articles by children of ethnic minorities in China and children of workers describing their happy lives. The books supplied by Shanghai Children's Publishing House this time are all beautifully printed, richly illustrated, and the content includes children's patriotic stories, children's life stories, biographies of people's heroes, common sense of natural science, and introductions to the life of Soviet Young Pioneers, such as "Young People of the Mao Zedong Era" and excellent Soviet children's literature works such as "Fire Horse," "Mijia's Five Points," and "Go to Report to Stalin," which have long been warmly welcomed by young readers in various places.
　　In Guangzhou, the Guangzhou branch of Xinhua Bookstore has shipped more than 260 kinds of children's books, a total of more than 63,000 copies. The first outlet of the Guangzhou branch of Xinhua Bookstore on Yonghan North Road has successively set up three special counters for children's books for children starting from the 22nd, and the counters are filled with newly published children's books. The interest of children in Guangzhou in buying books is multifaceted: popular science books compiled by the famous Soviet popular science writer Ilyin have long been sold out. The two books "Korean Juvenile Guerrillas" and "The Most Touching Thing for Me" for older children sold more than 3,000 copies in the first quarter of this year. Children are also very interested in science and technology books. They love the book "Young Engineer," although the stock has long been sold out; however, until now, many children come to inquire about the book's arrival date every day.

China Young Children's Theater Will Perform on "June 1st"
    Children's Drama "Comrades Are With You"
　　The China Young Children's Theater attached to the China Youth Art Theater will perform the Soviet children's drama "Comrades Are With You" at the Beijing Youth Palace on "June 1st" International Children's Day, to entertain outstanding young pioneer team members from middle and elementary schools in the capital and children of various countries living in Beijing. It will be officially performed at the Beijing Theater starting from June 4th.
　　This drama vividly and lively depicts the life and work of members of the Lenin Communist Youth League in Soviet schools; through the story of an outstanding young pioneer team member joining the Lenin Communist Youth League, it shows the new qualities of the young generation in socialist society, who resolutely and seriously carry out ideological struggles for the purity of the league and for the noble honor of the league members. In this drama, you can see how Soviet schools and league organizations are educating young people to become true people—loyal, brave Soviet citizens. At the same time, the script tells us that to obtain the glorious title of Lenin Communist Youth League member, we must put the honor of the collective first. This is a children's drama with profound ideological content and a moving story, which is of great educational significance to our Chinese children and young people.
　　In order to perform this drama well, the actors of the China Young Children's Theater, in addition to carefully studying the script, discussing the theme, analyzing the characters, and reading reference books, also went to the actual environment to experience life. They participated in the league and team activities in the school, made friends with the students, familiarized themselves with their lives and work, and understood their psychology and emotions.

    北京、上海、广州在“六一”前夕
    准备供应大量儿童读物
    北京、上海、广州各大书店和出版社在“六一”国际儿童节前夕，准备了大量儿童读物，供应广大小读者的需要。
    在北京市，新华书店北京分店准备从本市和外地的各出版社购买三百六十三种儿童读物和有关儿童问题的书籍；中国图书发行公司北京门市部也从上海购进了五十一种儿童读物；青年出版社在“六一”前后将出版专门指导少年儿童队活动的少年活动丛书共十种。为了充分供应儿童各种书籍，新华书店北京分店准备在“六一”当天组织流动供应站到北海公园、西郊公园、劳动人民文化宫、故宫、颐和园、天坛等地，为儿童服务。国际书店北京分店也准备在“六一”节在该店门市部和中山公园专门出售介绍各国儿童生活的读物。

    中国少年儿童剧团“六一”将演出
    儿童剧“同志们和你在一起”
    中国青年艺术剧院附属的中国少年儿童剧团将于“六一”国际儿童节在北京青年宫演出苏联儿童剧“同志们和你在一起”，招待首都各中、小学的优秀少年儿童队队员和侨居北京的各国儿童。六月四日起将在北京剧场正式公演。
    这个剧生动活泼地描写了苏联学校里的列宁共产主义青年团团员的生活和工作；通过一个优秀的少年先锋队队员加入列宁共产主义青年团的故事，表现了社会主义社会年青一代的新品质，他们为团的纯洁性、为团员的崇高荣誉而坚决地严肃地进行思想斗争。在这个剧里可以看到苏联学校、团组织在怎样教育青年成为真正的人——忠诚、勇敢的苏联公民。同时剧本又告诉我们，要获得列宁共产主义青年团团员的光荣称号，必须把集体的荣誉放在第一位。这是一个富有深刻的思想内容和动人的故事的儿童剧，对我们中国的少年儿童们和青年们是有极大的教育意义的。
    中国少年儿童剧团的演员们为了要把这个戏演好，除了认真研究剧本、讨论主题、分析人物、阅读参考书外，并到实际环境里去体验生活。他们参加了学校里的团、队活动，跟学生交朋友，熟悉他们的生活和工作，了解他们的心理和感情。
