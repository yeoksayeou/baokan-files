    The Shaoyang Administrative Office Should Immediately Take Effective Measures to Inspect and Repair Damaged Reservoirs in the Area

    Reader Long Nanlin writes: There are many problems with small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in various parts of the Shaoyang Special District, Hunan. Many reservoirs were built with soil that was too wet and not compacted; or the soil clods used were not broken up, and contained sand, gravel, grass clippings, etc. As a result, they soon cracked, leaked, or even collapsed. For example, the Wangshi Reservoir near Shixiajiang in the Seventh District of Dongkou County, which covers forty acres, collapsed on one side of its embankment due to leakage and cannot store enough water at all; in the Dalong Township of the same district, a joint group has six reservoirs, of which two cannot store water at all, one leaks, and one has a collapsed embankment, leaving only two in good condition; in the Ninth District of the county, a large-scale dam leaks in three places due to hasty construction, seriously affecting water storage. Some reservoir embankments are built too steeply (some exceeding 70 degrees), or the foundation was not cleared during construction, or the location is not suitable, resulting in serious subsidence of the foundation stones and soil. For example, a large dam recently built in Duijiang Township, Ninth District of Xinning County, which can irrigate 800 acres of land, leaks and subsides in the lower central part of the embankment. In some places, when digging reservoirs, sand was carried to the mountain slopes in front of the reservoir without proper treatment, and when it rained, the sediment ran back into the reservoir. The above situation is very common. According to a survey in Xinning County alone at the beginning of this year, there were eighty-eight reservoirs with damage and leakage problems in the county.

    The main reason for these problems is that the Shaoyang Special District simply assigned quotas for building reservoirs when carrying out small-scale water conservancy construction, without providing specific guidance. As a result, county and district cadres, in order to "complete the task," reported each reservoir as completed regardless of its quality. Until now, the Shaoyang Administrative Office and its subordinate county people's governments have not taken measures to inspect and repair these reservoirs. In order to do a good job in preventing and combating drought and ensuring a bumper harvest, it is recommended that the Shaoyang Administrative Office attach importance to this issue, conduct a detailed inspection of the local water conservancy situation, and quickly take effective remedial measures.

### 邵阳专署应即采取有效办法检查并修补当地损漏的塘坝

专栏：读者来信摘要

    邵阳专署应即采取有效办法检查并修补当地损漏的塘坝
    读者龙楠林来信：湖南邵阳专区各地小型农田水利工程中有不少问题，许多塘坝修建时所用的土太湿，没打紧；或者所用土块没有打烂，有砂石、草屑等筑在里面；因此不久就裂开、漏水甚至崩溃。如洞口县七区石下江附近四十亩大的王师塘就因漏水而垮了半边塘基，根本贮不满水；该区大龙乡麦下塘的一个联组共六口塘，其中有两个根本不能贮水，一个漏水，一个塘基崩了，只有两个好的；该县九区一个工程很大的坝因为工程草率而有三处地方漏水，严重影响贮水。有些塘坝的坝基筑得太陡（有的达七十度以上），或筑时没清理基脚，或地点不合适，使基石泥土有严重的下塌现象。如新宁县九区对江乡新修的一个可以灌八百亩田的大坝，坝基的中央下部就漏水并向下塌。还有些地方挖塘时把沙土挑到塘前山坡上而没作妥善处理，一下雨泥沙又跑回塘里了。以上情况是很普遍的，仅据新宁一县今年年初的调查，全县就有八十八口塘有损漏现象。
    产生这些问题的原因，主要是邵阳专区在进行兴修小型水利工作时单纯分配修筑塘坝数字，而没有作具体领导工作，以致各县县、区干部为了“完成任务”，就不管修出的塘坝好不好，修起一个就向上报一个。直到现在，邵阳专署及所属各县人民政府还没有设法检查和修补这些塘坝。为了做好防旱抗旱，保证农业丰产，建议邵阳专署重视这个问题，对当地水利情况作详细的检查，并迅速采取有效的补救办法。
