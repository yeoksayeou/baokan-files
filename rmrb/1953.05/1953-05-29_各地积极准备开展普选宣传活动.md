Xinhua News Agency, May 28th:

    Various localities are now actively preparing to launch universal suffrage propaganda activities among the broad masses of the people.

    To carry out the universal suffrage propaganda, various localities have made a series of arrangements. The Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) convened a propaganda work conference in mid-May, formulating a provincial universal suffrage propaganda plan, deciding to mobilize various propaganda forces and combine it with production to carry out universal suffrage propaganda. The universal suffrage propaganda plan formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Election Committee stipulates that in the preparation stage of universal suffrage before July, the great significance of universal suffrage and the basic spirit and main content of the election law should be publicized among the people of the province. The Propaganda Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CCP convened a meeting of provincial-level propaganda departments on May 14 to arrange the universal suffrage propaganda work. All departments have formulated specific plans to carry out propaganda. The Propaganda Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CCP also instructed the propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels that the universal suffrage propaganda work must be closely integrated with production; in ethnic minority areas where universal suffrage is being carried out, attention should be paid to publicizing the spirit of ethnic equality and unity, and respecting the customs and religious beliefs of ethnic minorities.

    In order to carry out the upcoming universal suffrage propaganda, various localities have printed a large number of documents and propaganda materials related to universal suffrage. The first batch of 920,000 copies of the "Election Work Handbook" compiled and printed by the Central Election Committee was distributed to various localities in early May; the second batch of 460,000 copies has now been printed and will be sent out soon. The Civil Affairs Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee has distributed 95,000 copies of the "Election Work Handbook" allocated by the Central Election Committee to various localities, and has compiled and printed 140,000 to 200,000 copies of "Propaganda Handbooks" and "Work Handbooks" on universal suffrage according to local needs, for supply to various localities. More than 59,000 copies of the "Election Work Handbook" printed by the Sichuan Provincial Election Committee have been distributed to various counties, cities, and grassroots election units. Popular propaganda materials on elections compiled and printed in Jiangsu Province were also distributed to various localities before May 20. In early May, Xinhua Bookstore Shandong Branch sold more than 16,000 copies of documents such as the Election Law. The election committees and propaganda organs of many provinces and cities are also organizing and compiling a large number of popular universal suffrage propaganda materials in literary and artistic forms. The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has organized two groups of literary and art workers to go to grassroots election pilot areas to collect materials, preparing to create various forms of popular works. "Sichuan Literature and Art," "Sichuan Popular," and "Popular Pictorial" and other newspapers and periodicals will publish a large number of comic strips and storytelling materials promoting universal suffrage from June. The election committees or literary federations of Fujian, Gansu, and Heilongjiang provinces are also drawing and compiling various comic strips, slides, storytelling, short plays, songs, ditties, etc., to meet the needs of universal suffrage propaganda.

    The work of training and organizing propaganda teams for universal suffrage propaganda is also being stepped up in various localities. The Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CCP has begun to rectify the city's Party propaganda network in various streets by district, and will also centrally train propagandists in the first half of June. More than 180,000 propagandists in Sichuan Province will be trained by district. In addition, 34 mobile film projection teams and 400 slide projectors will be organized to go deep into the countryside to carry out universal suffrage propaganda to farmers. More than 440 cultural centers and cultural stations throughout the province will use blackboard newspapers, broadcasting tubes and other forms to carry out propaganda. Newspapers, radio stations, theatrical troupes, and reporters and propagandists affiliated with the local organizations of the CCP in Anhui Province will launch a wide-ranging and in-depth universal suffrage propaganda campaign from June. The Propaganda Department of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the CCP has prepared propaganda points and popular speaking materials for them.

    Cadres and the masses in various localities have begun to study documents related to universal suffrage. More than 60,000 cadres in Tianjin City have begun to study the Election Law and related documents since May 14. Under the leadership of the Study Committee of the Tianjin Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, people from all walks of life have also plunged into the upsurge of studying the Election Law. More than 2,100 representatives of the Chongqing Municipal and District People's Representative Conferences have undergone a month-long study. The representatives carefully read the universal suffrage documents and held group discussions. The Consultative Committee of the Municipal People's Representative Conference also organized a lecturer group composed of representatives of various democratic parties, who will go to various districts to carry out universal suffrage propaganda to people from all walks of life. Cadres of various agencies in Shenyang and Lushun cities are currently studying universal suffrage documents. He Xia, Deputy Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CCP, recently gave a report on universal suffrage issues at a conference of more than 1,800 Party member cadres. Cadres of various agencies and organizations in Hubei Province have launched a two-week study on issues related to universal suffrage since May 10. The Provincial Study Committee has also organized many responsible cadres to give reports to the broad masses of cadres. More than 3,000 people listen to the reports every week. Cadres of the civil affairs departments at the provincial and prefectural levels in Fujian Province and cadres of agencies below the county level have begun a two-week study; the study for cadres of general agencies at the provincial and prefectural levels will begin at the end of May.
