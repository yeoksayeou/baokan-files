Lin Yingyi, the head of the Quanzhou Popular Drama Troupe in Fujian, violated laws and discipline in July 1952 by arbitrarily conducting a "lifestyle rectification" within the troupe. Due to serious bureaucracy on the part of relevant leaders, the well-known actress Lin Xiulai committed suicide. The matter has been investigated by a special task force organized by the Fujian Provincial Cultural Bureau and relevant units, and a decision has been made by the Provincial People's Supervision Committee.

The Quanzhou Popular Drama Troupe was established in March 1951 and was directly led by the Propaganda Department of the Quanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Minister Li Yinggui personally in charge, and Lin Yingyi was appointed as the head of the troupe, and Wu Jingshui as the political instructor, with a total of more than 40 people. The troupe's famous actress, Lin Xiulai, was a good singer and was very popular with the audience. When she was eighteen years old, she fell in love with and became engaged to Chen Jiande, but they did not marry for various reasons. Later, they each married other people. After the establishment of the Popular Drama Troupe, Lin and Chen worked in the same troupe and developed feelings again. Lin Yingyi, the head of the troupe, had always been harsh towards the performers, often punishing them by making them stand or kneel, or dismissing them for minor reasons. In March of last year, he suspended Chen Jiande from his duties and docked his salary for a month, asking Chen to reflect on the issue of his relationship with women. A month later, Wu Jingshui consulted the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department and requested the expulsion of Chen Jiande. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department did not examine the many charges made against Chen and approved the request.

In May of last year, the troupe performed in Xiamen. Lin Yingyi again convened a meeting of troupe members under a pretext and forced Lin Xiulai to confess her relationship with Chen Jiande, scolding her for being "shameless." Xiulai attempted to commit suicide by jumping into the sea but was rescued by the People's Police. That evening, Lin Yingyi decided at the troupe affairs committee to suspend Xiulai from her duties and dock her salary for reflection. The next day, he announced the punishment at a meeting of troupe members, forcing Xiulai to stop performing for eight days. Lin Yingyi asked people to persuade Xiulai to confess. Xiulai said she could confess, but requested that she not be struggled against at a public meeting. Lin Yingyi still convened a meeting, announced the issues Xiulai had confessed outside the meeting, and forced her to admit them at the meeting. Because she was afraid of losing her job, she had no choice but to admit them one by one in public.

In June of last year, when the troupe returned to Quanzhou, Lin Yingyi arbitrarily arranged a "lifestyle rectification," and struggled against Xiulai again. He made prior arrangements, instructing the troupe members to demand that Lin Xiulai be given punishments such as suspension of salary, expulsion, surveillance, and control, and shouted slogans such as "No confession, no administration!" and "No victory, no retreat!" He also threatened everyone: "Those who do not speak actively will have their salaries reduced." When the struggle session began, the troupe members were in low spirits. Lin Yingyi then said: "Those who do not speak have problems." The troupe members had no choice but to pretend to be active. Some asked her to kneel, some slapped her, and her husband was also forced to slap her once. He told people afterwards that he had gritted his teeth when he hit her. Unable to bear it any longer, Lin Xiulai began to confess her relationship with Chen Jiande. Lin Yingyi made many more malicious inquiries. At one point, Xiulai was tied up at the meeting. Lin Yingyi pretended to mediate and ordered her to be untied. After the struggle session, Lin Yingyi and the artistic director Yang Bo gave a cursory report to the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department did not investigate further and only ordered them to end the lifestyle criticism meeting.

After being struggled against, Lin Xiulai often cried, saying that she had no face to go on stage and see the audience. Lin Yingyi struggled against her during the day and forced her to perform at night, saying that she was not allowed to perform badly, and if she did, she would be struggled against again. At 10:00 a.m. on July 13th, Xiulai finally took advantage of a moment when people were not paying attention and hanged herself in her room. She was five months pregnant. Thus, due to Lin Yingyi's violation of laws and discipline, a serious incident involving two lives was caused. After Xiulai's death, many people went to her home to mourn her and publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the incident. All the troupe members guarded her body, wailing and crying, and went on a hunger strike to express their protest.

The Propaganda Department of the Quanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China did not pay enough attention to the suicide of Lin Xiulai. Afterwards, the deputy minister only gave a report on "stabilizing emotions" to the troupe and pointed out that Lin Xiulai's suicide was her own fault, saying that she was ignorant and did not understand the Marriage Law. In order to evade responsibility, Lin Yingyi wrote a report to the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, saying that Chen Jiande should be held responsible for Xiulai's death, falsely claiming that Chen had complex social relationships and was provoking the feelings of Xiulai and her husband. According to the Municipal Party Committee's opinion, the Quanzhou Municipal Court sentenced Chen Jiande to two years of imprisonment on December 16th on the charge of "violating the Marriage Law, obstructing the family, and causing death," and sent him to a labor reform team to serve his sentence.

In February 1953, the truth of the above facts was clarified. The Fujian Provincial People's Supervision Committee made the following decisions: 1. Lin Yingyi, as the administrative leader, had a bad work style, did not follow the instructions of his superiors, did not act in accordance with policies, acted against orders, arbitrarily arranged "lifestyle rectification," and violated laws and discipline. He was the principal culprit in causing this incident and it was decided to give him the administrative punishment of dismissal from his post and send him to court for punishment according to law. 2. Wu Jingshui, the political instructor, did not report the true situation of the troupe to the leaders, did not oppose or stop Lin Yingyi's wrong behavior, and later shirked responsibility with Lin and shifted the blame to others. He committed serious errors and it was decided to give him the administrative punishment of dismissal from his post. 3. Li Yinggui, the Minister of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department (now the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee), had serious bureaucracy in his leadership of the troupe, did not understand the situation in depth, did not investigate and research, and did not give clear instructions to resolutely correct the problems after they were discovered. He also did not attach enough importance afterwards to further clarify the rights and wrongs and investigate responsibilities. It is recommended that he be given certain disciplinary punishments within the Party. Other relevant personnel and departments should conduct in-depth self-criticism regarding this incident and make it public in order to restore influence, educate cadres, and improve work. Chen Jiande is innocent and should not have been expelled and sentenced. He should be released and returned to the troupe. The family of the deceased Lin Xiulai should be given condolences.

    福建泉州市大众剧社社长
    林英仪违法乱纪逼死人命已送法院惩处
    一九五二年七月间，福建泉州市大众剧社社长林英仪违法乱纪，擅自在社内搞“生活整风”，并由于有关领导方面的严重官僚主义，致使该省著名女演员林秀来自杀身死。此事已经福建省文化局与有关单位组织专案小组进行检查，并已由该省人民监察委员会定案处理。
    泉州市大众剧社于一九五一年三月成立，由中共泉州市委宣传部直接领导，部长李英贵亲自掌握，并派林英仪为社长，吴镜水为政治指导员，全社四十余人。该社著名女演员林秀来演唱都好，极受观众欢迎。她在十八岁时和陈建德恋爱订婚，因种种原因没有结婚，二人后来各自婚嫁。大众剧社成立后，林、陈二人同在一个剧社工作，又有了感情。社长林英仪对待艺人的态度一贯恶劣，常因细故把艺人罚站罚跪或开除。去年三月他把陈建德停职罚薪一个月，要陈反省男女关系问题。一个月后，又由吴镜水到市委宣传部请示，要开除陈建德，市委宣传部对乱加在陈头上的许多罪名，未加审查，就批准了。
    去年五月，该社在厦门演出，林英仪又借故召开社员大会，强要林秀来坦白和陈建德的关系，并骂她“不知害羞”，秀来企图投海自杀，经人民警察拦阻后得救。当晚林英仪在社务委员会上决定要秀来停职罚薪反省，次日在社员大会上宣布处分，强迫秀来停演八天。林英仪叫人动员秀来坦白，秀来表示可以坦白，但要求不要在大会上斗争她。林英仪仍召开了大会，宣布秀来在会外交代的问题，迫令她在大会上承认，她因怕失业，只好一一当众承认。
    该社在去年六月回到泉州，林英仪擅自布置了一次“生活整风”，又斗争秀来，并预先布置，指定社员们要求给林秀来以停薪、开除、监视、管制等处分，并呼口号“不坦白交行政”、“不胜利不收兵”等。他还威胁大家：“不积极发言的要降薪。”斗争会开始时，社员情绪低落，林英仪就说：“不发言的都有问题。”社员们只好假装积极，有的要她跪下，有的打了她一巴掌，她的丈夫也被迫去打了她一下。他过后告诉人家说，他是咬了牙根打的。林秀来不得已，才开始坦白他和陈建德的关系。林英仪又作了很多恶劣的追问。会上一度把秀来绑起来，林英仪假装调解，命令松绑。斗争会后，林英仪和艺术指导杨波到市委宣传部轻描淡写地汇报一遍，市委宣传部没有加以追究，只令他们把生活检讨会结束。
    林秀来被斗后常流泪，说无颜上台见观众。林英仪白天斗争她，晚上还要她演戏，并且说不准演坏，演坏了还要斗。七月十三日上午十时，秀来终于趁人不备，在房内上吊自杀了。她已怀孕五个月，因此由于林英仪的违法乱纪，造成一案两命的严重事件。秀来死后，不少群众到她家去哭她，对这事件公开表示不满。全社演员守尸嚎哭并绝食，表示抗议。
    中共泉州市委宣传部对林秀来自杀事件不够重视，事后只由副部长去该社作了一次“安定情绪”的报告，并指出林秀来自杀是她自己的错误，说她无知，不懂婚姻法。林英仪为逃避责任，给市委宣传部写了报告，说秀来之死要陈建德负责，诬称陈社会关系复杂，挑拨秀来夫妇感情等。泉州市法院根据市委意见就在去年十二月十六日以“违反婚姻法妨碍家庭致死”的罪名，判陈建德徒刑二年，送劳动改造队服役。
    一九五三年二月，上述事实真象才被弄清。福建省人民监察委员会作了如下的处理决定：一、社长林英仪身为行政领导，作风恶劣，不按上级指示，不按照政策办事，阳奉阴违，擅自布置“生活整风”，违法乱纪，是造成这一事件的主犯，决定行政上予以撤职处分，并送法院依法惩处。二、政治指导员吴镜水不向领导方面汇报该社真实情况，对于林英仪的错误行为不加以反对和制止，事后并与林一起推卸责任，嫁祸于人，所犯错误是严重的，决定行政上予以撤职处分。三、市委宣传部长李英贵（现任市委书记）对该社的领导存在严重的官僚主义，不深入了解情况，不调查研究，发现问题后亦没有指示明确办法坚决纠正，事后亦未引起足够重视，进一步查明是非，追究责任，建议给以一定的党纪处分。其他有关人员、有关部门对于这一事件都应作深刻检讨，并加公布，以挽回影响，教育干部，改进工作。陈建德无罪，不该开除判罪，应予释放回社。对死者林秀来家属应进行抚恤。
