    Unclear Teaching Direction of the Russian Department of Northeast Commercial College
    Letters from Gui Fu and He Hanwei of Northeast Commercial College: The study period for the Russian Department of Northeast Commercial College is three years. Among the courses offered, there are very few Russian courses related to commerce. The first and second grades use textbooks compiled by Harbin Foreign Languages ​​College, and the third grade studies Soviet literature. Only in the second semester of the third grade is there a course on "Commercial Knowledge". The school administration once said: Professional Russian knowledge can only be learned further at work. We believe that the purpose of setting up such a Russian department in a commercial college is unclear. Moreover, our school's Russian department currently has only more than 200 students and more than 30 teachers; at a time when universities across the country are lacking Russian teachers, this is also a waste.

### 东北商业专科学校俄文系教学方针不明确

    东北商业专科学校俄文系教学方针不明确
    东北商业专科学校桂馥、何汉伟来信：东北商业专科学校俄文系修业年限是三年。所修课程中，有关商业的俄文课程很少。一、二年级用的是哈尔滨外国语专科学校所编教材，三年级学苏联文学，到三年级第二学期时才有一门有关“商业知识”的课程。学校行政方面曾说：专业俄文知识只能到工作岗位上去自己再学习。我们认为：在商业专科学校设这样一个俄文系目的是不明确的。并且我校俄文系目前只有学生二百多名，老师有三十多名；在全国各地大学俄文系师资缺乏的时候，这也是一个浪费现象。
