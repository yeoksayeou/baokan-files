Timely Cotton Seedling Replenishment and Protection is Key to Achieving a Bumper Cotton Harvest

The nationwide cotton sowing work has basically been completed, and most areas are now shifting to the seedling inspection and replenishment stage. This year, many areas did not adopt safe and effective sowing methods based on the soil's dryness and wetness when sowing cotton, resulting in varying degrees of missing seedlings. Therefore, seedling inspection and replenishment are very important.

After cotton sowing, the emergence situation should be checked at any time according to the local sowing method and the general date required for cotton emergence. Before the cotton seedlings emerge from the soil, if the soil surface hardens due to rain, and the seedling buds cannot break through the hard soil, the surface soil of the cotton rows can be loosened lightly with a short-toothed rake in time. If "suffocation of seedlings" occurs due to excessive soil cover, the soil should be uncovered appropriately and the soil surface loosened. In areas with more underground pests such as cutworms and grubs, control and treatment should be carried out by combining manual catching and using methods such as straw piles or poisonous bait. If there is a lack of seedlings after the cotton seedlings emerge from the soil, seedlings can be transplanted to fill the gaps during the thinning and setting period. In recent years, various places have advocated the use of transplanting methods for seedling replenishment, and good results have been achieved. Especially in areas where there is no shortage of rain or where there are irrigation conditions, the survival rate of transplanted seedlings is generally above 80 or 90 percent. The transplanting method is very simple: first, dig holes in the places where seedlings are missing, and then select healthy cotton seedlings from the places where there are more seedlings. After watering to saturate the soil, use a transplanting tool or a small flower shovel to dig out the cotton seedlings with their roots and soil. The size of the soil block should be such that the entire root is protected, and care should be taken not to break up the soil block and expose the roots. The dug-out seedlings should be immediately moved to the dug holes, with soil piled around them, and then watered once to saturate the soil before leveling the soil surface. Transplanting should be done sooner rather than later, generally when the seedlings have two to four or five true leaves. Transplanting is more suitable on cloudy or rainy days.

In order to ensure full seedling emergence, attention should be paid to the techniques of seedling thinning and setting. The principles of "early thinning, dense retention, and timely setting" should be followed, and thinning should be carried out in stages. When the cotton seedlings grow one true leaf, thinning can generally begin; a second thinning should be carried out when there are two or three true leaves. Cotton planted in strips between wheat rows should be thinned once before the wheat harvest. Cotton planted by dibbling should pay more attention to thinning in stages to avoid the roots of the seedlings from becoming entangled. Setting should not be too late, as crowded and yellow seedlings will affect development; however, in cotton fields with more underground pests or diseases, or in cotton fields prone to alkali damage, setting should be delayed, and three thinnings can be carried out, with setting done during the third thinning. When setting seedlings, the distance between plants should be uniform and consistent, not too far or too close; otherwise, the cotton seedlings will not utilize the soil fertility evenly, and development will not be uniform. It is necessary to combine local bumper harvest experience and specific conditions such as cotton field fertility, cotton seed characteristics, and cultivation techniques to achieve reasonable close planting; if not enough seedlings are retained, it will inevitably affect yield. The position of the set seedlings should be staggered with the seedlings in the adjacent rows to form a triangle, and should not be set side by side. In addition, attention should be paid to promoting "new thinning techniques," that is, when carrying out thinning work, diseased and insect-infested seedlings should be removed first, and the thinned cotton seedlings with diseases and insects should be collected and taken out of the field for burning or burial to reduce the spread of diseases and insects.

In order to promote early and rapid growth of cotton seedlings, weeding and hoeing should be carried out in a timely manner in conjunction with thinning and setting work to conserve moisture, preserve fertilizer, and increase soil temperature. Low-lying and wet cotton fields should pay attention to opening ditches for drainage. Cotton fields lacking fertilizer should be fertilized with an appropriate amount of decomposed cake fertilizer or chemical fertilizer immediately after setting, especially in wheat-cotton double-cropping fields, quick-acting topdressing fertilizers such as night soil should be applied as early as possible after the wheat harvest and setting to promote cotton seedling development.

Aphids and spider mites are the most widespread pests in the main cotton-producing areas of the country, posing a very serious threat to cotton growth, and generally start to harm the cotton during the seedling stage. Therefore, we must be vigilant, prepare medicines and equipment, and check the cotton fields at any time after setting. If pests occur, we must vigorously prevent and control them in accordance with the principles of early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment.

    及时做好棉花补苗保苗工作是争取棉花丰产的关键
    新农
    全国各地棉花播种工作已经基本完成，大部地区正转入查苗补苗阶段。今年许多地区在播种棉花的时候，没有根据土壤干湿程度，采取安全有效的播种方法，以致造成了大小不同程度的缺苗现象。因此，查苗补苗工作是十分重要的。
    棉花播种后，应根据当地播种方法和一般棉花出苗所需要的日期，随时检查出苗情形。在棉苗出土以前，如遇雨土面板结，苗芽不能顶破硬土时，可及时用短齿耙轻轻疏松棉行表土的硬层。如覆土过厚发生“闷苗”现象，应适当揭土并疏松土面。地老虎、蛴螬等地下虫害较多地区，应结合人工扑捉，利用堆草或毒饵等方法进行除治。棉苗出土后，如有缺苗现象，可在间苗到定苗时期移苗补齐。近几年来，各地提倡用移栽方法进行补苗，都得到了很好的成绩。特别是在雨水不缺或有灌溉条件的地区，移苗成活率一般都在百分之八、九十以上。移苗的方法很简单，先将缺苗的地方挖好穴窝，再在苗多的地方选取生长健壮的棉苗，浇水渗透后，用移植器或小花铲将棉苗连根带土掘出，土块大小以保住全根为度，注意不要弄散土块露出根来。掘出的苗，立即移到挖好的穴窝里，四周壅土，再浇水一次，渗透后即覆平土面。移苗宜早不宜晚，一般应在幼苗生有两个到四、五个真叶时期进行。阴雨天移苗更为适宜。
    为了保证全苗，应该讲究间苗定苗的技术。要掌握“早间苗、密留苗、适时定苗”的原则，分次进行。棉苗生出一个真叶时，一般就可开始间苗；有两三个真叶时进行第二次间苗。在麦行中间条播的棉花，在收麦前即应进行一次疏苗工作。点播的棉花更应注意分次疏间，以免苗根盘结。定苗不应过迟，迟则棉苗拥挤黄瘦，将影响发育；但在地下虫害或病害较多的棉地或容易受碱害的棉地，定苗应当晚些，可间三次苗，在第三次间苗时定苗。定苗时，要使株棵间的距离均匀一致，不要过远或过近；否则棉苗利用地力不均衡，发育就不会整齐。要结合当地丰产经验，根据棉田肥力、棉种性状以及栽培技术等具体条件，做到合理密植；如果留苗不够，必然会影响产量。定苗的位置要与邻行苗棵交错成为三角形，不要并排定苗。此外，应注意推行“新间苗技术”，即在进行间苗工作时，要尽先把带有病、虫的苗间除，并且要把间拔下来的带有病虫的棉苗装起来带到田外，烧毁或埋掉，以减免病虫的蔓延。
    为了促使棉苗发的早，长的快，应结合间苗定苗工作，及时进行中耕除草，以保墒保肥及增进地温。低湿棉田要注意开沟排水。缺肥棉田应在定苗后即施用适量的腐熟饼肥或化学肥料，特别是麦棉两熟的棉田，在收麦定苗后，更应及早施用水粪等速效追肥，以促进棉苗的发育。
    蚜虫、红蜘蛛是全国各主要棉区为害最普遍、对棉花生育威胁极严重的害虫，而且一般在苗期即开始为害。因此，必须提高警惕，做好药械准备工作，定苗以后，随时检查棉田，如发生虫害，即根据早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治的方针，大力加以防治。
