Xinhua News Agency, May 21st dispatch from Jakarta: Newspapers here widely commented on the International Rubber Research Group meeting held in Copenhagen.

As is well known, Indonesia was the first country to propose stockpiling rubber to stabilize prices in the world market. The stability of rubber prices in the world market is particularly important to Indonesia, as rubber exports account for 50% of Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings. US monopoly capital, which manipulates raw material prices, has lowered the price of rubber exported from Indonesia by more than 60% compared to 1951. Currently, Indonesian rubber is worth only 18 US cents per pound, and the US wants to further reduce the price to 16 US cents per pound.

The weekly "Sunday Courier" said: Most of the Indonesian people depend on rubber for their livelihood, but the price of rubber is much lower than before World War II. This is due to the United States' attempt to ensure their exclusive control of the Indonesian rubber market. Since the United States is the only buyer of Indonesian rubber, it is easy for it to manipulate the price of rubber.

The "Sunday Courier" finally said: The situation in Malaya and Brazil is the same as in Indonesia, with the only exception being Ceylon, because Ceylon sells its rubber to the People's Republic of China.

Xinhua News Agency, May 20th dispatch from Ottawa: Canadian newspapers criticized the US trade policy towards Canada. The "Citizen" wrote in an editorial: The United States, on the one hand, restricts the import of Canadian agricultural products, and on the other hand, exports a large quantity of goods to Canada. On May 13th, under the headline "Canada Should Rationally and Realistically Study Trade Relations with the United States," the newspaper summarized the opinions of many Canadian newspapers. In this article, the "Citizen" listed a series of newspaper protests against US trade policies, particularly against the US ban on Canada's trade with people's democratic countries.

    印尼报纸不满美国操纵胶价
    加拿大报纸抨击美国的贸易政策
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社雅加达讯：此间报纸广泛评论在哥本哈根举行的国际橡胶研究小组会议。
    如所周知，印尼是建议把橡胶囤积起来，以稳定世界市场价格的第一个国家。世界市场上橡胶价格的稳定对于印尼特别重要，因为橡胶出口占印尼赚取外汇的输出的百分之五十。操纵原料价格的美国垄断资本把从印尼输出的橡胶价格比一九五一年压低了百分之六十以上，目前印尼橡胶每磅只值美金一角八分，美国还想再把价格压低到美金一角六分。
    每周出版的“星期日传信报”说：大部分印尼人民都依靠橡胶为生，但是橡胶的价格比第二次世界大战以前低了很多。这是由于美国企图保证他们独占印尼橡胶市场所造成的。由于美国是印尼橡胶唯一的买主，它很容易操纵橡胶的价格。
    “星期日传信报”最后说：马来亚和巴西的情况也和印尼相同，只有锡兰是唯一例外，因为锡兰把它的橡胶卖给中华人民共和国。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社渥太华讯：加拿大报纸抨击美国对加拿大的贸易政策。“公民报”在社论中写道：美国一方面限制加拿大农产品的入口，另一方面却大量向加拿大输出商品。该报五月十三日在“加拿大应该合理地与现实地研究对美国的贸易关系”的标题下，综述了许多加拿大报纸的言论。在这篇文章里，“公民报”列举一系列报纸对美国贸易政策的抗议，特别是抗议美国禁止加拿大与人民民主国家进行贸易。
