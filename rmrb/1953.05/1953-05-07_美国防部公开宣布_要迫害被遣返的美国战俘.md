Xinhua News Agency, Washington: The U.S. Department of Defense publicly announced on April 28th that it would persecute repatriated American sick and wounded prisoners of war. The Defense Department's statement said that all repatriated prisoners of war would be transported to Valley Forge Army Hospital near Philadelphia; those who were unwilling to abandon their new understanding of things would be persecuted under the guise of "special attention and medical treatment." According to the Associated Press, special equipment has been installed at Valley Forge Hospital to "treat" these prisoners of war. To prevent the content of this so-called "treatment" from being leaked and causing public outrage in the United States, the U.S. Department of Defense has forbidden these prisoners of war from meeting with reporters and has refused to disclose the number and names of these persecuted prisoners of war.

    美国防部公开宣布
    要迫害被遣返的美国战俘
    【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：美国国防部在四月二十八日公开宣布要对被遣返的美国病伤战俘加以迫害。国防部的声明说，全部被遣返的战俘将被运往美国费城附近的熔炉谷陆军医院；其中那些不愿意放弃自己对于事物的新认识的人，将在“特别的注意和医药治疗”的名义下受到迫害。据合众社报道，在熔炉谷医院里已经装置了特别的设备来“治疗”这些战俘。为了避免这种所谓“治疗”的内容泄露出去而引起美国人民的公愤，美国国防部禁止这些战俘接见记者，并拒绝透露这种受迫害的战俘的人数和姓名。
