Laiyang Special District Cooperatives in Shandong Province improved the supply of production materials this year in the first quarter by combining it with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, achieving significant results. According to incomplete statistics as of March 26: in the first quarter, cooperatives throughout the special district supplied farmers with 146 waterwheels (materials missing from Pingdong, Yexian, Yexiannan, Penglai, and Qidong counties), 1,194 walking plows, 7,349,000 catties of chemical fertilizer, 11,380,000 catties of bean cake, and a large amount of miscellaneous fertilizer. The supply of chemical fertilizer was more than double that of the same period last year. According to statistics from cooperatives in nine counties of the special district, 1,507 head of livestock were supplied to farmers in the first quarter. Cooperatives in Pingdong and eight other counties sold 8,806 iron shovels, more than 6,700 pieces of agricultural tools such as hoe blades, sickles, and shovel heads, and successively organized iron production cooperatives to process and manufacture agricultural tools according to seasonal needs.

This year, cooperatives at all levels in Laiyang Special District combined the supply of production materials with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, educated cooperative cadres, greatly overcame the phenomena of coercion and apportionment in their work, and made the relationship between the cooperatives and the vast number of cooperative members closer.

In February of this year, the special district held an enlarged meeting of county cooperative directors and managers, and each county cooperative held a meeting of grassroots cooperative directors, implementing the policy of "cooperatives serving production." Cooperative cadres' confidence in their work was improved, and they generally felt that "this year's policies are clear and the methods are specific; only in this way can we truly serve the masses." Grassroots cooperative cadres said: In the past, they only knew how to buy and sell, focusing solely on making money, burdened with the idea of "fearing failure to complete tasks and fearing losses." This year, the policy is clear, and the work is easier to do. On the basis of this understanding, they profoundly criticized the purely task-oriented and purely profit-oriented views in their past work, and then invested a large amount of capital in operating production materials. Most grassroots cooperatives in each county withdrew half of their funds to operate production materials. The shelves of the Chengguan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Laiyang County were previously filled with printed cloth and general merchandise, but now they are mostly stocked with small agricultural tools, pesticides, and other production materials. Cooperatives at all levels also strengthened the business cadres in charge of operating production materials; each grassroots cooperative has someone specifically engaged in the supply of production materials.

In the work of supplying production materials, Laiyang Special District paid attention to publicity through examples and strengthened technical guidance. Because farmers have conservative ideas and because forced apportionment occurred in most areas last year, many farmers did not believe in the benefits and effectiveness of walking plows and chemical fertilizers. Some said: "The walking plow is too heavy, and the livestock cannot pull it." Some farmers believed that chemical fertilizer was effective for autumn crops, but not for wheat. In view of these situations, the cooperative grasped two key links: conducting in-depth publicity through examples and strengthening technical guidance. On the one hand, they summarized the successful experiences of using chemical fertilizers and walking plows last year, and used examples to conduct comparative education; on the other hand, they emphasized that cadres should learn technology and go deep into the fields to teach farmers. Due to the leadership of the leading cadres of each county, a wave of cadres learning technology was set off. The Laiyang Special District Cooperative selected cadres from various grassroots cooperatives to concentrate on training in the use of walking plows and chemical fertilizers, and taught them to conduct field experiments. After the cadres learned the technology, their confidence in going deep into the mutual aid groups was improved. In the past, they were afraid that farmers would ask them about the technology of using new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers. Now it is different; cadres are willing to approach farmers because they have learned the technology and can solve problems for farmers. Now, every grassroots cooperative in the special district has cadres who can use and repair walking plows, so when promoting walking plows, cooperative cadres generally put forward the slogans of "guarantee to teach" and "teach first and then buy, no sale if you don't know how." In practical work, most cadres have developed a working style of patiently mobilizing persuasion, conducting meticulous technical guidance, and being conscientious and responsible. After the masses were taught by the cadres and learned in the field, they also generally felt that "the cooperative's style has changed, and this year they are teaching how to use the walking plow, not apportioning it." Therefore, they actively purchased the production materials they needed. In early March, the Tenth District of Qidong County sold out all the more than 40 walking plows accumulated last year by teaching technology. The masses also requested to buy nine more. Three cadres from the Yuanli Cooperative in Laixi County who learned the technology took turns going to the villages to teach the technology. Now they have sold 56 walking plows. The director of the Nanlan Village Grassroots Cooperative in the county personally carried the walking plow to the countryside to teach the masses. In just over ten days, all 20 walking plows in the cooperative were bought out by the masses, and they requested to allocate new ones. In Qixia, some districts bought one as soon as they learned one during field study experiments on walking plows. The masses have now changed their views on new agricultural tools. They said, "It's not that the walking plow is not easy to use, but that we didn't know how to use it in the past." Farmers personally experienced that the advantages of plowing with new walking plows are "fast," "deep," and "level." This method of combining publicity through examples with technical guidance and combining cadres with the masses not only smoothly promoted chemical fertilizers and walking plows, enabling them to exert their due effectiveness, but also changed the past working style of cooperative cadres forcing orders.

In the work of supplying production materials in the first quarter, the Laiyang Special District Cooperative used the working method of "creating base points to promote the overall situation," and began to change the bureaucratic style of cadres of higher-level cooperatives squatting in organs to issue orders, only arranging and not inspecting. At the beginning of the spring plowing production, under the unified leadership and organization of the Special District Party Committee, the Special District Cooperative selected six section chiefs and more than 20 general cadres to form three working groups and went to Pingdu, Laixi, and Laiyang counties in the special district to inspect and help grassroots cooperatives carry out the supply of spring plowing production materials, which greatly helped lower-level cooperatives. Each county cooperative also sent special personnel to participate. In addition to selecting personnel to participate in the base point work, the grassroots cooperatives also had special personnel responsible for inspecting and guiding the promotion of walking plows in each village. Cadres generally felt that "with working base points, concentrating efforts, creating experience, there are ways to do the work."

Strengthen the leadership of party committees at all levels over the cooperatives. Under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, the cooperatives attached importance to mobilizing the masses in practical work, proceeding from the current urgent demands of the masses to carry out their work. They overcame the erroneous idea that "mobilizing the masses is the responsibility of the party committee, and supplying business is the responsibility of the cooperative" that existed in the past. Due to the evil consequences of forced apportionment in the supply of production materials last year, the impact on farmers was very bad. When the working group organized by the cooperative arrived in Zhongzhudong Village in Laixi County, the masses said: "The people who apportion chemical fertilizers and force the sale of walking plows are here again." Some also said: "The superiors are here! Let them carry the walking plows back." After the comrades of the working group went deep into understanding and actual experiments, they found that the village had borrowed six "166" clay walking plows from 1950 to 1952, but they could not be used because they were not suitable for the local soil, and the masses were very dissatisfied. In view of these situations, the working group first convened a meeting of cadres and a meeting of the masses to review the task-oriented views and coercive command style when promoting walking plows last year, and declared that the clay walking plows would be taken back, replaced with good walking plows, and the masses would be taught how to use them. Cooperative cadres also took time to participate in spring plowing with the masses, helping them deliver manure, and teaching them how to use walking plows and chemical fertilizers; they also introduced farmers who had difficulty purchasing fertilizers to banks to apply for loans, and the masses responded very well. When the cooperative cadres left, the farmers affectionately said: "Comrades, you must come often in the future!" This practical education greatly encouraged the work confidence of the cooperative cadres. Some cadres said: "As long as we go deep into the masses, understand their ideological situation, and help them, the masses will believe in and support the cooperatives."

    莱阳专区合作社今年第一季度改进了生产资料供应工作
    范子真  孙翼功
    山东省莱阳专区合作社今年结合反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪斗争，改进了生产资料供应工作，取得了显著的成绩。据三月二十六日不完全的统计：第一季度全专区合作社已供应农民水车一百四十六部（缺平东、掖县、掖南、蓬莱、栖东五个县的材料），步犁一千一百九十四部，化学肥料七百三十四万九千斤，豆饼一千一百三十八万斤，还供应了大量的杂肥。化学肥料的供应量较去年同时期多一倍以上。另据该专区九个县合作社的统计，第一季度已供应农民一千五百零七头牲口。平东等八个县社已售出铁锨八千八百零六张，锄板、镰刀、铲头等农具六千七百余件，并根据季节需要陆续组织铁业生产社加工制造农具。
    今年莱阳专区各级合作社把生产资料供应工作和反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪斗争结合起来进行，教育了合作社干部，大大克服了工作中的强迫命令和摊派现象，使合作社和广大社员群众的关系更加密切。
    今年二月，该专区曾召开县社主任、经理扩大会议，各县社召开了基层社主任会议，贯彻了“合作社为生产服务”的方针，合作社干部工作信心提高，普遍感到“今年的方针明确，办法具体；只有这样才能真正作到为群众服务”。基层社的干部说：过去只知道买和卖，光为赚钱打圈子，背着个“怕完不成任务，怕赔钱”的包袱；今年明确了方针，工作就好作了。他们在这一认识的基础上，深刻地批判了过去工作中的单纯任务观点和单纯营利观点，随即投入大量资金经营生产资料。各县基层社大多抽出半数资金经营生产资料。莱阳县城关区供销社门市货架上以前摆满了花布和百货用品，现在摆的多是小农具、农药等生产资料。各级社也加强了经营生产资料的业务干部；每个基层社都有人专搞生产资料供应工作。
    莱阳专区在生产资料供应工作中，注意了实例宣传并加强了技术指导。由于农民存在保守思想和去年多数地区发生了强迫摊派的现象，很多农民不相信步犁和化学肥料的好处和效能。有的说：“步犁太重，牲口拉不动”。有的农民认为：用化学肥料喂秋田行，喂小麦不起作用。根据这些情况，合作社抓紧了进行深入的实例宣传和技术指导两个环节。一方面总结了去年使用化学肥料、步犁成功的经验，用实例对比进行教育；一方面强调干部要学会技术，深入田间，教会农民。由于各县领导干部的带头，便掀起了干部学技术的热潮。莱阳专区合作社抽调了各基层社的干部集中训练使用步犁、化学肥料的方法，并教他们进行实地试验。干部学会了技术以后，深入互助组的信心便提高了。过去他们就怕农民问自己使用新式农具和化学肥料的技术。现在不同了，干部都愿接近农民，因为他们学会了技术，能给农民解决问题了。现在该专区每个基层社都有干部会使用和修理步犁，因而在推销步犁时合作社干部普遍提出：“保证教会”和“先教后买，不会不卖”的口号。在实际工作中，多数干部均发扬了耐心动员说服、进行细腻的技术指导和认真负责的工作作风。群众经过干部亲手教、实地学习之后，也普遍感到“合作社作风转变了，今年是教会使用步犁，不是摊派了”。因而积极购买所需要的生产资料。栖东县十区在三月上旬通过教会技术，即将去年积存的四十余部步犁全部卖光。群众并要求再买九部。莱西县院里合作社三个学会技术的干部轮流到各村教技术，现在已推销出五十六部步犁。该县南岚村基层社主任亲自扛着步犁下乡教群众，十几天的时间，社内的二十部步犁，全部被群众买光，并要求再拨新的。栖霞有的区在实地学习实验步犁时，群众学会一部即买走一部，群众现在对新式农具的看法也有了转变，他们说：“不是步犁不好使，而是过去不会使”，农民亲身体会到：用新式步犁耕地的好处是“快”、“深”、“平”。这种实例宣传与技术指导相结合，干部与群众相结合的方法，不仅顺利地推销了化学肥料、步犁，使其发挥了应有的效用，同时也转变了过去合作社干部强迫命令的工作作风。
    莱阳专区合作社在第一季度供应生产资料工作中，运用了“创设基点、推动全面”的工作方法，开始转变了上级社的干部蹲在机关发号施令，光布置不检查的官僚主义作风。春耕生产一开始，专区社在地委统一领导和组织之下，即抽调了科长六人和一般干部二十余人，组成三个工作组分赴该专区平度、莱西、莱阳县检查并帮助基层社进行春耕生产资料供应工作，对下级社帮助很大。各县社也都派出专人参加。基层社除抽调人员参加基点工作外，并有专人负责到各村检查指导步犁的推广工作。干部普遍感到“有了工作基点，集中力量，创造经验，工作就有办法了”。
    加强各级党委对合作社的领导，合作社在各级党委统一领导下，在实际工作中重视了发动群众，从群众的当前迫切要求出发去进行工作。克服了过去存在的“发动群众是党委的，供应业务是合作社的”的错误思想。由于去年在供应生产资料工作中强迫摊派的恶果，给农民的影响很坏，当合作社组织的工作组一到莱西县中渚东村时，群众就说：“摊派化学肥料强卖步犁的人又来了”，也有的说：
    “上级来人啦！让他们把步犁扛回去”。经工作组同志深入了解和实际实验，发现该村从一九五○年到一九五二年先后贷了六部“一六六”黏土步犁，因不适合当地土质而不能用，群众很不满意。工作组根据这些情况，首先召开了干部会和群众会，检讨了去年推销步犁时的任务观点和强迫命令作风，并声明把黏土步犁收回，再换上好步犁，教会群众使用。合作社干部还抽出空，和群众一起春耕，帮助他们送粪，教他们使用步犁和化学肥料；对购买肥料有困难的农民还介绍他们到银行去贷款，群众反映很好。合作社干部临走时，农民都亲热地说：“同志，你们以后还要常来啊！”这种实际的教育，大大鼓舞了合作社干部的工作信心。有的干部说：“只要深入群众，了解他们的思想情况并帮助他们，群众是会相信和拥护合作社的。”
