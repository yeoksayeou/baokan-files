Editor's Note: Many construction departments are currently engaged in foundation engineering construction. To ensure project quality, technical responsibility systems and mass-based quality responsibility systems must be strengthened at construction sites to prevent various potential quality accidents. The phenomena pointed out in the Songjiang Provincial Committee's circular and the reasons for these phenomena are widespread. All construction sites should learn from this experience and promptly mobilize technical personnel and workers to seriously discuss and establish various technical and quality responsibility systems.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] In response to the call to "strive for early commencement and more commencement," basic construction units in Songjiang Province have begun construction on the first phase of projects since early April. However, in some units that have commenced work, serious quality deficiencies have already occurred in foundation engineering or wall bricklaying. To prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, the Industry Department of the CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee has issued a circular requiring leading cadres of all units to combine quality inspection with the establishment of a responsibility system, strengthen technical management, and establish and improve technical quality responsibility systems.

The poor quality of some projects that have commenced in Songjiang Province has already caused serious consequences such as rework, prolonged construction periods, and waste of labor and materials. In the No. 1 Chimney project of the No. 2 Engineering Company of Harbin City, it was discovered when the chimney reached a height of 14 meters that the central axis deviated from the foundation center by 8.5 centimeters, forcing temporary remedial measures, prolonging the construction period by ten days, and causing a loss of 30 million yuan in labor and material costs. At the Medical University construction site of the Songjiang Provincial Engineering Company, as many as 15 quality accidents occurred in ten days. Because there was no water on the construction site, quicklime was used instead of lime paste to mix mortar, which will inevitably lead to cracks in the future, seriously affecting the life of the entire project. In the bricklaying projects of the No. 1 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau, the phenomenon of dry bricks being used on walls, uneven mortar joints, and uneven wall surfaces is widespread. In the second work zone of the construction site, the quality of the first layer of wall reached only 50% to 60% of the prescribed standard, and the quality of the second layer of wall reached only 70% to 75%.

The main reasons for these situations are that individual units have one-sidedly understood the spirit of "striving for early commencement and more commencement," neglecting to actively carry out the necessary construction preparation work, and some even started construction without design drawings. Some leading cadres have a weak concept of "project quality first." When quicklime was used instead of lime paste at the Medical University construction site, workers raised objections, but the technical cadres believed that "this is how it has always been done" and refused to accept the suggestions. In the stonework project of one work zone, the drawings clearly stipulated digging 2.2 meters deep, but the work zone director subjectively instructed to dig 2 meters, resulting in all the work being reworked after compaction. Technical management is also very chaotic: in some cases, both parties, A and B, did not strictly implement the drawing review system; the contractor did not adequately explain the quality standards and operating procedures to the workers; the inspection mechanism was not sound, and there was no strict and timely inspection system; the duties of the construction personnel were not clear, and they neglected the responsibility of supervising and inspecting the project quality.

The circular of the Industry Department of the CCP Songjiang Provincial Committee pointed out that this situation is very serious. At the beginning of construction, all institutions and systems are not yet sound, and there is no specific and clear technical quality responsibility system; the living and welfare of workers are not adequately taken care of, and the workers' ideological morale has not been completely stabilized; the proportion of new workers has increased, and most apprentices, although having undergone winter training, lack practical operating experience; in addition, the projects that are starting construction are entirely foundation projects, which requires even more attention to quality. The circular requires leaders at all levels to quickly take the following measures:

1.  Conduct in-depth education of employees to establish a concept of project quality. Educate employees to understand the importance of project quality, especially the importance of foundation engineering. Because if foundation engineering is done poorly, it will not only require rework, waste labor and materials, but also affect the life of the entire project. It is necessary to criticize several erroneous ideas: such as the complacency and irresponsible bureaucratic style of management personnel, the "good enough" mentality of technical personnel, and the passive, fear-of-responsibility thinking; the "just get by" mentality of workers and the lack of attention to quality, etc. In addition, it is necessary to explain to employees the quality standards, operating procedures, and their significance and purpose. At the same time, special attention should be paid to mobilizing technical personnel and staff.

2.  Strengthen technical management and establish and improve the technical quality responsibility system. At present, it can be combined with the establishment of a responsibility system movement to first promote both parties, A and B, to conscientiously implement the work of reviewing drawings; then, according to possible and necessary conditions, establish and improve a practical technical quality responsibility system, especially the responsibility system of the construction site director, construction personnel, and team leaders. Secondly, improve the inspection mechanism and various inspection systems, establish a joint office for both parties, A and B, to regularly study project quality issues together and exchange information on a daily basis to seek timely solutions to problems. In addition, the handover inspection system, daily completion inspection system, sub-item and sub-section project inspection system, and hidden project inspection system should be quickly established and improved as needed.

Also Reported: The phenomenon of poor quality foundation engineering in many projects undertaken by the Lüda No. 2 Construction Engineering Company is very serious.

Most of the projects currently under construction by the company are foundation engineering projects. Due to the lack of education on the importance of foundation engineering quality by leading cadres to construction site management cadres and technical personnel; and the failure to conduct timely and in-depth inspections after the start of the project, many instances of poor foundation engineering quality have occurred. According to incomplete statistics, there have been more than 20 large and small projects that have been reworked due to poor foundation engineering quality. For example, in the foundation engineering of the 110 construction site, the 50-centimeter foundation width was dug to 40 centimeters; the foundation wall should have been wider at the bottom and narrower at the top, with a layer of steps in the middle, but it was built with the same width at the top and bottom; the foundation wall should have been built in the center of the foundation, but some were biased to one side; where the construction site had slopes, the foundation trench should have been dug in a stepped shape, but it was dug to the same depth. In addition, when pouring foundation mortar, the mortar was not measured with a container, but with an earth basket; the grouting should have been tamped to ensure the strength of the mortar and the foundation stone, but it was simply stirred with an iron shovel. For example, the management cadres of the 131 construction site did not pay attention to the quality of the foundation engineering. When digging the foundation trench, they should have used stakes (nailing line boards) to hang the line, but they only nailed four corners. The line boards for the foundation trench of the indoor wall were not nailed. They only measured with a measuring tape, drew a mark on the ground, and asked the workers to dig. After digging, they did not hang the line to check whether it met the specifications, and they started to install the foundation. Some management cadres and technical personnel at the construction site believed that it did not matter if the foundation engineering quality was a little poor, since it would be buried in the ground anyway, and they would not be able to see it. Because they neglected the quality of foundation engineering in this way, the foundation of the wall was biased by 20 centimeters, and narrower by 3 to 7 centimeters. Some foundation walls were also built obliquely, so they had to be reworked. Even more serious was the 135 construction site, when the foundation wall was built to 50 centimeters high, it was discovered that it was skewed by 7 centimeters, but they did not study how to correct it and asked the workers to continue building it up. In this way, a step was built in the middle of the wall, and later it was buried with soil.

Although the above phenomena have attracted the attention of the company's leadership, and the company has organized engineering and technical personnel to conduct in-depth inspections of various construction sites, it still does not pay enough attention to how to grasp the problems that have now been discovered and strengthen the education of construction site management cadres and technical personnel. Therefore, the engineering company should focus on criticizing the thinking of not paying attention to quality and establish a quality responsibility system to ensure project quality in the establishment of the responsibility system movement.

    中共松江省委工业部发出通报
    加强责任制保证基础工程质量
    旅大第二建筑工程公司许多基础工程质量低劣
    编者按：目前不少施工部门正在进行基础工程的施工，为保证工程质量，必须在施工现场加强技术责任制和群众性的质量责任制，防止各种可能发生的质量事故。松江省委通报中所指出的现象以及产生这些现象的原因带有普遍性质，各施工现场应当接受这一经验教训，及时发动技术人员和工人，认真讨论，和建立质量上技术上的各种责任制。
    【本报讯】松江省各基本建设单位在“争取早开工和多开工”的要求下，第一期工程从四月初起已陆续开工。但是已开工的部分单位，在基础工程或墙身砌砖工程中，已发生了严重质量低劣现象。中共松江省委员会工业部为防止类似事故继续发生，已发出通报，要求各单位的领导干部在建立责任制运动中，结合检查质量的工作，加强技术管理和建立与健全技术质量责任制。
    松江省已开工的部分工程质量低劣，已造成返工、拖长工期、浪费工料等严重情况。哈尔滨市第二工程公司第一工地一号烟囱工程，砌到十四公尺高时才发现中心轴与基础中心相差八点五公分，被迫临时补救，拖长工期十天，损失工料费三千万元。松江省工程公司医大工地，十天中发生质量事故十五次之多。因为工地无水就把生石灰代替石灰膏拌成灰浆使用，将来势必裂缝，严重影响整个工程寿命。有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司砌砖工程普遍发生干砖上墙，灰缝不匀，墙身里出外进，凹凸不平的现象。该工地第二工区在砌第一层墙身时，质量只达到规定标准的百分之五十到六十，砌二层墙时也只达到百分之七十到七十五。
    产生这些情况的主要原因是个别单位片面地了解“争取早开工和多开工”的精神，忽视积极做好应有的施工准备工作，有的甚至没有设计图纸就开了工。部分领导干部对工程质量第一的观念很薄弱，医大工地将生石灰代替白灰膏使用时，工人曾提出意见。但技术干部认为“过去就是这样干的”，拒不接受。一工区砌石工程图上明明规定挖二点二公尺深，工区主任却主观地指示挖二公尺，结果打完夯又全部返工。技术管理工作也非常混乱：有的甲、乙双方没有严格地执行图纸审核制度；承建单位没有很好地向工人具体说明质量标准和操作规程；检查机构不健全，没有严格的及时的检查制度，施工员职责不明，忽视了对工程质量的监督、检查的责任。
    中共松江省委员会工业部的通报中指出：这种情况是十分严重的。施工开始，一切机构、制度还不健全，没有具体明确的技术质量责任制；工人的生活福利照顾不够，工人思想情绪还未完全安定；工人新成分增多，多数徒工虽经冬训，但缺乏实际操作经验；加以开始施工的工程完全是基础工程，这就更要注意质量。通报要求各级领导应迅速采取下列措施：
    一、深入教育职工树立工程质量观念。教育职工认识工程质量的重要性，特别是基础工程的重要性。因为搞坏了基础工程，不但要返工，浪费人工和材料，而且还会影响整个工程的寿命。要批判几种错误思想：如管理人员中的自满思想和不认真负责的官僚主义作风，技术人员中的差不多和不主动、怕负责任的思想；工人中的将就对付、不重视质量的思想，等等。此外要向职工讲清楚质量标准、操作规程及其意义与目的。同时特别要注意发动技术人员和职员。
    二、加强技术管理，建立与健全技术质量责任制。目前可结合建立责任制运动，首先促使甲、乙双方认真执行审核图纸的工作；然后根据可能与必要条件，建立与健全切实可行的技术质量责任制，尤其是工地主任、施工员、小组长的责任制。其次，健全检查机构和各种检查制，成立甲、乙双方联合办公室，定期在一起研究工程质量问题和每日碰头交流情况，求得问题的及时解决。此外，还要把交接检查制、每日收工检查制、分部分项工程检查制、荫蔽工程检查制，根据需要迅速地建立和健全起来。
    又讯：旅大第二建筑工程公司所承担的许多工程，基础工程质量低劣的现象很严重。
    该公司现在已施工的工程，目前大部分正在进行基础工程的施工。由于领导干部缺乏向工地管理干部和技术人员进行关于基础工程质量的重要性的教育；工程开工后，又没有及时深入检查，许多基础工程质量低劣的现象就产生了。据不完全的统计，因基础工程质量低劣而返工的大小工程，已有二十余处。例如一一○工地的基础工程，五十公分的基础宽度挖成了四十公分；基础墙本应下宽上窄，中间砌一层台阶，但却砌成了上下一般宽；基础墙本来应该砌在地基的中心，但是有的却偏向了一面；工程场地有斜坡的地方，地基槽本应当挖阶梯型的，却挖成了一样的深度。另外，在灌基础浆时，灰的调合不是用容器量，而是用土筐量；灌浆本来应当捣固，才能保证灰与基石的强度，但是，只用铁锨搅拌一下就算了事。又如一三一工地的管理干部对基础工程质量不注意，挖地基槽本来应当标桩
    （钉线板子）挂线，可是他们却只钉了四个角，屋内壁子的地基槽的线板子没有钉，只用盘尺一量，在地上画了道印，就要工人挖，挖好了也不挂线检查一下，是否合乎规格，就开始装地基。该工地的某些管理干部和技术人员认为基础工程质量差点没有什么，反正是要埋在土里，也看不着它。由于他们这样忽视基础工程质量，结果壁子的地基偏了二十公分，窄了三公分到七公分，还有的基础墙砌斜了，因而不得不返工。更严重的如一三五工地，基础墙砌到五十公分高时，就已经发现砌歪了七公分，但他们并没有研究纠正，要工人继续砌上去，这样在墙半腰砌出了一个台阶，后来就把它用土埋死了。
    上述现象虽已引起该公司领导方面的注意，该公司组织工程技术人员深入各工地进行了检查，但是，对于如何抓住现在已发现的问题，加强向工地管理干部和技术人员进行教育这一点，仍然注意不够。因此，该工程公司在建立责任制运动中，应着重批判不重视质量的思想，建立质量责任制，以保证工程质量。
