In the vast rural areas of our motherland, many rural nurseries have emerged. The establishment of these nurseries has freed many rural women from the burden of childcare, making them skilled workers on the agricultural production front. The rural nursery in Taiping Township, Chongde County, Zhejiang Province, is one example of these many rural nurseries.

In late May, when the farmers of Taiping Township were busy with silkworm cocooning and preparing to harvest spring rapeseed, the Township Nursery Management Committee was actively planning and adjusting the township's nursery staff and convening mothers' meetings to welcome the children to the nursery. Many villages were renovating and cleaning the nursery buildings. The nursery of Xu Tongchu Mutual Aid Team in the Fourth Village had been decorated beautifully, with New China Children's New Year pictures pasted on the walls, colorful balls hanging in the room, and a red floral cloth banner reading: "Chairman Mao teaches people not to be poor, the Communist Party brings a good life!"

Taiping Township currently has forty-one rural nursery groups of varying sizes. These nursery organizations were established under the leadership of Wang Caina, the director of the Township Women's Federation, before the autumn harvest in 1951. These nursery groups, in conjunction with the production season, solved the problem of labor shortage faced by farmers during the busy farming season, and were therefore loved by the farmers of the township. According to statistics, from 1951 to the present, more than 450 children have been cared for in the nursery groups. The children live an orderly and relatively reasonable life in the nursery groups. The nursery staff use the rice, mung beans, and potatoes sent by the children's mothers to make various snacks for the children to eat, and wash their hands two or three times a day, and take a nap at noon. The nursery staff also teach the children to sing, dance, and love cleanliness. If the children get sick, the nursery will immediately contact the district health clinic and ask a doctor to treat them. Thanks to the constant care of the Nursery Management Committee and the attentive care of the nursery staff, the children have now become lively and lovely chubby babies.

In order to run the nursery better, the township also ran a training class for nursery staff last winter. More than fifty old women learned new childcare methods and basic knowledge of cleanliness and hygiene in the training class.

Since the organization of rural nurseries, agricultural production in Taiping Township has been greatly promoted. 533 women in the township have been freed from family burdens and participated in field labor, more than 250 of whom are members of mutual aid teams, and some have even become leaders of mutual aid teams. In the autumn of 1951, the entire township dug up more than 1,780 mu of rice roots, 90% of which were dug by women. During the summer harvest of 1952, the 7,000 mu of rapeseed fields in Taiping Township were also mostly harvested by women. A woman named Tang Gui'e in the Tenth Group of the Fifth Village used to be unable to participate in production because she had to take care of her children, and her family had little labor, so the harvest was very poor. In 1950, she only harvested 100 jin of rice per mu. Since her child was placed in the nursery, she has actively participated in production, and in 1952 she was able to harvest nearly 500 jin of rice per mu, an increase of four times compared to 1951. Because women participated in production and made certain achievements, they were generally praised. The thinking of many male farmers who belittled women is gradually changing. Xu Tongchu, the leader of the Mutual Aid Team in the Fourth Village, said that last year the team had a bumper harvest of 120 jin more per mu than the previous year, and he believed that this was related to the addition of six female laborers to the team. Xu Tongchu said: "In the past, the team did not have enough labor. When we were busy weeding, we could not take care of pest control; when we were busy pumping water, we could not take care of fertilizing. Last year, the team added six women. Taking weeding as an example, last year's rice paddies were weeded two to three times more than the previous year."

Since its establishment, the Taiping Township Rural Nursery has been valued and supported by governments at all levels. After the autumn harvest last year, the township's forty-odd nurseries conducted a comparison and summarized their experiences. Under their influence, other townships in Chongde County have universally organized rural nurseries. Now, there are 258 nurseries in the county, with more than 1,700 children in care.

### 太平乡的农忙托儿所

    太平乡的农忙托儿所
    新华社记者  方徨
    在我们祖国的广大农村里，出现了许多农忙托儿所，这些托儿所的建立，使很多农村妇女摆脱了孩子的牵累，成为农业生产战线上的能手。浙江省崇德县太平乡的农忙托儿所，就是这许许多多农忙托儿所中的一个范例。
    五月下旬，太平乡的农民正忙于春蚕结茧准备收割春花的时候，乡托儿所管理委员会已在积极计划和调整全乡的保育员和召开母亲会议，迎接孩子们到托儿所来。很多村都在修饰和打扫托儿所的房子，四村徐同初互助组的托儿所，已经打扮得很漂亮，墙上贴了“新中国儿童”的年画，屋子里悬挂着彩球，一块红色的花标布上写着：“毛主席教人不受穷，共产党带来好光景！”
    太平乡现有四十一个大小不一的农忙托儿组，这些托儿组织都是在一九五一年秋收前在乡妇女联合会主任王才娜的领导下组织起来的。这些托儿组结合生产季节，解决了农忙时期农民缺乏劳动力的困难问题，所以受到了该乡农民的热爱。据统计，从一九五一年到现在，全乡受托的孩子已有四百五十多个。孩子们在托儿组里，过着有次序和比较合理的生活。保育员把孩子的母亲送来的大米、绿豆、洋山芋制成各种点心给孩子吃，每天还要给孩子洗两、三遍手，中午睡一次觉。保育员还教孩子们唱歌、跳舞，爱好清洁。孩子们如果有了病，托儿所就会马上向区卫生事务所联系，请医生来治疗。由于托儿所管理委员会的经常关心与保育员的细心照料，孩子们现在已变成活泼可爱的胖娃娃了。
    为了把托儿所办得更好，去年冬天，乡里还办了一期保育员训练班，五十多个老太太在训练班里学习了新育儿法和清洁卫生的基本知识。
    从组织了农忙托儿所后，大大地推动了太平乡的农业生产，全乡有五百三十三个妇女摆脱了家庭的牵累，参加了田间劳动，其中有二百五十多个妇女是互助组员，有的还当了互助组的组长。一九五一年秋天，全乡全部掘光了一千七百八十多亩稻根，其中有百分之九十是妇女挖掘的；一九五二年夏收时节，太平乡七千多亩的春花田，也大部是由妇女收割的。五村十组有个妇女叫唐桂娥，过去因为管孩子不能参加生产，家里劳动力又少，收成很不好，一九五零年每亩只收到一百斤稻。自从小孩放在托儿所以后，自己积极参加了生产，一九五二年每亩已能收稻近五百斤，比一九五一年增产了四倍。由于妇女们参加了生产，并做出一定的成绩，因此她们普遍受到了称赞。许多男农民轻视妇女的思想都在逐渐地改变了。四村互助组组长徐同初，谈到去年全组比前年每亩要增产一百二十斤的丰收时，他认为这是与该组增加了六个妇女劳动力有关的。徐同初说：“前年组里由于劳动力不够，忙了锄草顾不了治虫；忙了抽水顾不了施肥；去年组内增加了六个妇女，仅拿耘草一项来说，去年的秧田就比前年多耘了两次到三次。”
    太平乡农忙托儿所成立以来，一直就受到各级人民政府的重视与支持，去年秋收后，该乡四十多个托儿所曾进行了一次评比，并总结了经验。崇德县其他各乡在它们的影响下，都普遍组织了农忙托儿所。现在全县共有二百五十八个托儿所，受托孩子有一千七百多名。
