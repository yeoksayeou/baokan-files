Nationwide Rainfall

From the 19th to the 21st, there was widespread rainfall across the country.

In the Northeast region, there was localized rain on the 19th, followed by widespread rainfall across the entire region on the 20th, with heavier rainfall in the southwest and northern parts.

In the northeast of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Zhalantun experienced localized rainfall of 42 millimeters on the 20th, while other areas received lighter rainfall.

In the North China region, most areas of Suiyuan Province experienced soaking rain on the night of the 19th. Most counties in Hebei Province also received soaking rain, and the drought in the Zhangjiakou and Tangshan regions, which had lasted for a long time, has now been basically alleviated. Most areas of Shanxi Province experienced rainfall on the 19th and 20th. With the exception of some areas in Suiyuan Province, sowing is generally possible throughout the North China region.

In the Northwest region, Shaanxi Province experienced continuous rainfall on the 19th and 20th. In Gansu Province, the drought situation in the Tianshui and Pingliang areas has begun to ease due to the rainfall.

In the Southwest region, there has been no drought since the beginning of May. From the 19th to the 22nd, most areas of Sichuan, Xikang, and Guizhou provinces experienced rainfall.

In the East China region, from the morning of the 20th to the morning of the 21st, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces experienced rainfall. Shandong Province received heavy rainfall. The drought in Jiangsu Province has been generally alleviated, and farmers are actively replanting corn and cotton. After the rice seedlings received rain, farmers are carefully applying manure to the seedling fields to cultivate strong seedlings. In Anhui Province, the long-dried land can now be plowed after the rain, and the vast number of farmers throughout the province are now busily transplanting rice seedlings and replanting early autumn crops. Northern Zhejiang Province experienced rainfall of about 10 millimeters on the 19th. Southern Zhejiang Province and most areas of Fujian Province experienced moderate rain (rainfall between 10 and 25 millimeters within 24 hours).

In the Central South region, most areas of Hubei and Henan provinces experienced heavy rain on the 20th and 21st. The Hongan, Wuhan, Xiaogan, Yichang, and Shashi areas of Hubei Province were originally areas with more severe spring drought and had already launched drought prevention and resistance campaigns. After the rain, farmers are seizing the opportunity to store water in ponds and ditches to increase irrigation efficiency. In Henan Province, with the exception of the Nanyang and Xinyang regions, which received less rainfall, most other areas have been thoroughly moistened. This rainfall can provide sufficient moisture to the wheat stalks that are currently filling, avoiding the "premature ripening" of wheat caused by drought, and making the grains fuller; at the same time, it can ensure the timely sowing of late autumn crops, and the wheat fields that have been severely damaged by frost can also take advantage of the moisture to sow early autumn crops along the ridges. Most areas of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces and localized areas of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces experienced light rain (rainfall between 0.1 and 10 millimeters within 24 hours).

    全国普遍下雨
    十九日到二十一日全国普遍降雨。
    东北区十九日局部地区有雨，二十日全区普遍降雨，西南部和北部雨量较大。
    内蒙古自治区东北部扎兰屯局部地区二十日降雨四十二公厘，其他地区雨小。
    在华北区，绥远省大部分地区十九日夜降落透雨。河北省大部县份都下了透雨，干旱较久的张家口和唐山两专区，现在旱象已基本上解除。山西省十九、二十两天大部地区降雨。华北全区除绥远省部分地区外，一般都能播种。
    西北区陕西省十九、二十两天连续降雨。甘肃省天水、平凉一带因降雨，旱情开始缓和。
    西南区自五月上旬已无旱象。十九日到二十二日，四川、西康、贵州三省大部地区降雨。
    在华东区，二十日晨到二十一日晨，山东、江苏、安徽三省降雨。山东省雨量很大。江苏全省降雨，旱象普遍减轻，各地农民正积极补种玉米、棉花，稻田秧苗得雨后，农民细心地在秧田泼粪培育壮秧。安徽省久旱的田土在雨后已可翻耕，现全省广大农民正紧张插秧和补种早秋作物。浙江省北部十九日降雨十公厘左右。浙江省南部和福建省大部地区降中雨（二十四小时内雨量在十到二十五公厘）。
    在中南区，湖北、河南两省大部地区在二十、二十一两天下了饱雨。湖北省红安、武汉、孝感、宜昌、沙市等地区原来都是春旱较严重的地区，早已展开防旱抗旱斗争，落雨后农民都抓紧机会蓄水灌塘，开沟引水，增强灌溉效益。河南省这次降雨中，除南阳、信阳专区雨量较小外，其余大部地区都已透墒。这次降雨可以使正在灌浆的麦棵得到充足的水分，避免由于干旱所产生的小麦“急熟”现象，使籽实更加饱满；同时可以保证晚秋作物适时播种，受霜害较大的麦田也可以趁墒随垄点种早秋作物。湖南省、江西省大部地区和广东、广西两省局部地区降小雨（二十四小时以内雨量在零点一到十公厘）。（据新华社讯）
