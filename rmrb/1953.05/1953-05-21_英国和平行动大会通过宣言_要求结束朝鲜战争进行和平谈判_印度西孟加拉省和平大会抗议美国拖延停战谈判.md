Xinhua News Agency, London, May 18th: The British Peace Action Conference concluded on May 17th. The conference unanimously adopted a declaration calling on all men and women, regardless of political or religious belief, to unite in demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and the commencement of peace negotiations.

The conference also passed several other resolutions outlining practical methods for organizing the struggle for peace in Britain.

During the evening session, the conference elected the new Supreme Council of the British Peace Committee.

Dan. No. Pritt delivered a keynote speech to the conference, urging further intensification of the struggle for peace. He said: "We must tell the British government that it must act immediately. It must invite the major powers to hold talks now. It should not wait for Washington's consent. We must urge the British government to participate in the struggle for negotiations with the determination to succeed."

Pritt continued: "We must insist on talks between the major powers, which can achieve a unified, democratic, and independent Germany. At the same time, we must demand that genuine Chinese representatives be allowed to join the United Nations."

Representatives from all sectors of British society spoke in succession during the discussion, emphasizing that the ordinary people of Britain are determined to fight for peace.

The conference welcomed the wives and mothers of British soldiers fighting in Korea with thunderous applause. These women came to the conference to demand that the government immediately withdraw British troops from Korea. They presented the chairman of the conference with a petition signed by hundreds of British men and women supporting their demands.

Monica Felton, a prominent British public figure and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace," urged a broader and more active movement for peace.

Representatives from the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Electrical Trades Union called for expanded trade between the West and the East.

Professor Bernal condemned the U.S. stance in the Korean armistice negotiations.

Veteran George Cross pointed out that veterans do not want to participate in another world war. He said that the British people do not want to see U.S. troops and their atomic bombers on British territory because it is a threat to peace.

A mass rally was held after the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 20th: The Peace Conference of West Bengal, India, was held in Calcutta from May 15th to 17th. The conference unanimously adopted resolutions calling for an immediate armistice in Korea, protesting against the U.S. delay in armistice negotiations, and demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. A grand mass rally with 100,000 participants was held at the closing of the conference.

Participating in this peace conference were 463 peace delegates, 228 observers, and 200 guests from all over West Bengal. They represented many mass organizations and people from all walks of life and engaged in various professions.

The conference was presided over by Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace." In his speech at the opening ceremony, Kitchlew said that the current international situation is that, on the one hand, the United States and its aggressive bloc are openly inciting war; on the other hand, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other new democratic countries are openly advocating peace. The U.S. government is now openly arming Western European countries, preparing to launch a war. He said: When I traveled in the Middle East and Arab countries, everyone I came into contact with told me that the United States wanted to use weapons to "aid" the governments of these countries.

Romesh Chandra, Secretary-General of the All-India Peace Council, pointed out at the meeting that the Indian people and the Indian government are in favor of concluding a five-power peace pact and achieving peace in Korea. He called on the Indian people to further strengthen the peace movement.

The conference unanimously passed resolutions: demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact; demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea; protesting against the U.S. policy of delaying Korean armistice negotiations; banning the use of atomic bombs and bacteriological weapons; demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from all countries, and unrestricted trade between all countries on an equal footing; protesting against the terrorist policies pursued by the U.S. imperialists in colonial countries and the policy of racial discrimination practiced in South Africa; opposing Dulles' visit to India; and welcoming the World Peace Council's proposal for cultural exchanges between countries.

Dr. Kitchlew also delivered a speech at the mass rally held after the closing of the Peace Conference on May 17th, vehemently protesting the U.S. policy of using Asians to fight Asians.
