Experience of the Responsibility System Movement on the Construction Site of the Large Electric Motor Factory of the Bureau of Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration
	Jiao Mingqian, Guo Fengqi
Since the construction site of the Large Electric Motor Factory of the First Engineering Company of the Bureau of Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration launched the movement to establish a responsibility system on April 13, due to the repeated publicity of the purpose and significance of the movement by the leadership, mutual inspections from top to bottom, and the implementation of the principle of "inspecting while building," initial results have been achieved: the scope of responsibilities has been clarified, the division of labor has been defined, the responsibility system has been established, and the concept of quality first has been initially established. Based on our preliminary experience, thoroughly clarifying and resolving the following two issues is of great significance for the smooth development of the movement:

I. First, leaders must clearly understand the nature of the movement to establish a responsibility system, and absorb technical cadres to participate in leadership work, giving full play to their role.

At the beginning of the movement to establish a responsibility system, many leaders were still unclear about the nature of the movement. Therefore, everyone had different opinions on the development of the movement. Some believed that it was enough to formulate a few systems for all employees to implement, without mobilizing the masses to launch a movement; some believed that this was a political movement and advocated holding large-scale discussion meetings or "face-to-face struggle sessions"; some believed that the movement was a matter for Party and mass work cadres, and the administrative side should not interfere, viewing the movement as being opposed to the current central work; others believed that there was already a foundation from last year's movement to establish a responsibility system, and there were no major problems in this year's construction preparation work. The construction site leadership analyzed these ideas and believed that these incorrect ideas were mainly because the leaders lacked sufficient understanding of the nature and characteristics of the movement. Therefore, they organized them to study documents, clarify their understanding of the movement, and focused on educating them with specific examples of waste and lack of responsibility on the construction site. Only in this way was the leadership's thinking unified.

After the leadership's thinking was unified, it was also necessary to absorb senior technical cadres to participate in the leadership of the movement and give full play to their technical guidance role. At the beginning of the movement, they were all waiting to be "rectified," believing that this movement was "nothing to do with me." Therefore, the leaders convened a forum of key technical cadres, focusing on explaining the important significance of carrying out the movement to establish a responsibility system from a positive perspective, explaining the relationship between the Large Electric Motor Factory project and accelerating national industrialization, and explaining their glorious mission in national construction. In practical work, they also frequently sought their opinions. In this way, the technical personnel received a great education. For example, engineer Xi Xinqi took the initiative to unite other technical personnel to participate in the movement and discussed various scopes of responsibilities and construction plans with everyone.

II. The movement must be closely integrated with the current central work, grasp key issues and thoroughly solve them, and implement the principle of "inspecting while building" in a led and step-by-step manner. When the construction site launched the movement to establish a responsibility system, it was precisely in the tense stage of preparation work before construction. There was a lot of work, and many of the problems exposed by the workers were old accounts from the past, which were of little significance to the current work. Therefore, the leaders must have a clear understanding, find the key points based on the problems existing on the construction site, focus on solving them, and concentrate the momentum of the movement on the key issues under leadership. Before the start of construction, the construction site first designated specific personnel and set deadlines to formulate preliminary construction plans, technical supply plans, and construction organization designs, combined with mobilizing employees to discuss the construction plans, establish and improve various systems, clarify the scope of responsibilities, and clearly divide the work. The rationalization proposals put forward by the workers were also studied and the main problems existing on the site, such as water and electricity, were solved in a timely manner. These have powerfully promoted the current work, initially overcome the chaotic situation on the site, and shortened the preparation time. Secondly, the construction site also conducted quality education for all employees, establishing the idea of "a century-long plan, quality first," so as to establish and improve the quality responsibility system as early as possible, because the Large Electric Motor Factory project is not an ordinary project, but one of the key projects of the country's heavy industry construction. Therefore, in the first stage, the technical quality responsibility system was regarded as the center of the movement. After the movement was launched, in order to effectively ensure the quality of the project, an independent quality inspection agency was first established organizationally, with an engineer specifically responsible for this work. The number of inspectors was increased from three full-time cadres to eight, and work systems were established, and various quality standards and operating procedures were formulated. In order to enable workers to be familiar with and master them well, on the one hand, technicians and construction workers were organized to study the drawings according to their professional division of labor, and on the other hand, full-time engineers explained them to the workers in the form of large classes, and then technicians were organized in groups to go deep into each group to conduct discussions, and specific measures were put forward according to the specific situation of the group. After repeated quality education, the concept of quality first was established among all employees. Yin Shangjun, a worker in the cement team, said: "I only knew how to work to earn money before, and who cared about the quality. After this movement, my thinking has been straightened out. It is not enough for us to just make suggestions to the leaders. We ourselves must also establish a system." After the establishment of the quality responsibility system, the quality situation gradually improved. On May 10, an inspection of 2,800 rivets showed that only eleven had slight movement, and only two needed to be re-riveted, with a quality reaching 99.7 percent. In order to make the responsibility system movement closely integrated with the current central work and implement the principle of "inspecting while building," the administration designated specific personnel to be responsible for collecting the opinions put forward by the masses, carefully studying them, finding key problems to be solved, and announcing the solutions to the workers, which encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers to make suggestions.

    有色金属工业管理局大型电机厂工地开展责任制运动的经验
    焦明千  郭凤起
    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司大型电机厂工地自四月十三日开展建立责任制运动以来，由于领导方面反复地宣传了运动的目的和意义，进行了上下的互相检查，并贯彻了“边检查边建设”的方针，已初步收到效果：职责范围划清了，分工明确了，责任制建立了，质量第一的观念也初步树立起来。根据我们的初步体会，彻底弄清和解决以下两个问题，对运动的顺利开展，有很大的意义：
    一、首先是使领导干部明确认识建立责任制运动的性质，并吸收技术干部参加领导工作，充分发挥他们的作用。
    建立责任制运动开始时，许多领导干部还弄不清楚运动的性质。因此，大家对运动的开展有不同的意见。有的认为只要拟出几条制度让全体职工贯彻执行就行了，不必发动群众开展运动；有的认为这是一个政治运动。主张召开大型讨论会或“面对面的斗争会”；有的认为搞运动是党群工作干部的事，行政方面管不着，把运动和当前中心工作对立起来看；还有的认为已经有了去年建立责任制运动的基础，今年施工准备工作中的问题不大。工地领导方面对这些思想进行了分析，认为这些不正确的思想主要是因为领导干部对运动的性质和特点认识不足，因此就组织他们学习文件，明确对运动的认识，并着重以工地浪费和无人负责的具体事例进行教育，这样才使领导思想统一起来。
    领导思想统一以后，还必须吸收高级技术干部参加对运动的领导，发挥他们的技术指导作用。在运动之初，他们都等待“挨整”，认为这一运动“与我无关”，于是领导干部召集主要的技术干部座谈，着重从积极方面说明开展建立责任制运动的重要意义，向他们说明大型电机厂工程对加速国家工业化的关系，说明他们在国家建设中的光荣任务。在实际工作中，也经常征求他们的意见。这样，就使技术人员受到很大教育。如专责工程师奚新岐主动去团结其他技术人员参加运动，和大家共同讨论了各项职责范围和施工计划。
    二、必须使运动密切结合当前的中心工作，抓住关键问题彻底解决，有领导有步骤地贯彻“边检查边建设”的方针。该工地在开展建立责任制运动时，正是在施工前准备工作紧张的阶段，工作繁多，而且职工群众揭发出来的问题有很多是过去的老账，于当前工作意义不大，因此领导方面必须心中有数，根据工地存在的问题，找出关键，抓住重点加以解决，并有领导地将运动的锋芒集中到关键问题上来。在开工前，该工地首先指定专人、限定日期制订了初步施工计划、技术供应计划、施工组织设计，结合发动职工讨论施工计划，建立与健全各种制度，划清职责范围，明确分了工。并将工人提出的合理化建议加以研究，及时解决了现场存在的水、电等主要问题。这些都有力地推动了当前工作，初步克服了现场的混乱现象，缩短了准备工作时间。其次，工地并向全体职工群众进行了质量教育，树立“百年大计，质量第一”的思想，以便及早建立和健全质量责任制，因为大型电机厂工程不是一般的工程，而是国家重工业建设的重点工程之一。所以在第一阶段即把技术质量责任制当成运动的中心。运动开展后，为切实保证工程质量，首先从组织上建立了独立的质量检查机构，指定一个工程师专门负责这一工作，检查人员数目由以前三个专职干部增加到八名，并建立了工作制度，拟定了各项质量标准和操作规程。为使工人能够熟悉，很好地掌握，一方面组织技术员施工员按业务分工学习了图纸，另一方面以上大课方式由专职工程师向工人讲解，然后又以小组为单位组织技术员深入各小组进行讨论，根据小组具体情况提出了具体措施。经过反复的质量教育，在全体职工中树立了质量第一的观念，洋灰队工人尹尚君说：“我以前就知道干活挣钱，谁管它质量好坏，经过这次运动我的思想算通了，咱光给领导提意见不行，咱们自己也得建立制度。”建立质量责任制以后，质量情况逐渐好转，五月十日检查二千八百个铆钉中只有十一个微动，需要重铆的只有两个，质量达到百分之九十九点七。为使责任制运动紧密结合当前中心工作，贯彻“边检查边建设”的方针，行政上指定专人负责收集群众所提出的意见，认真加以研究，找出关键问题加以解决，并向工人宣布解决结果，鼓舞了职工提意见的积极性。
