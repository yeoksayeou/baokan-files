    Zhengzhou City People's Court Deputy Dean Zhang Rongji's Self-Criticism Regarding the Wrongful Detention of Sun Jisheng

    A letter from Zhang Rongji, Deputy Dean of the Zhengzhou City People's Court: After the People's Daily published the article "Zhengzhou City People's Court Should Make a Self-Criticism Regarding the Wrongful Detention of Sun Jisheng" on March 22nd, we immediately convened a meeting of the heads of all tribunals and the personnel involved in handling the case to study it. Through analysis and criticism, we have recognized the seriousness of this incident. My main errors are:

    (1) I only listened to reports and did not conduct actual inspections. What was particularly inappropriate was that Sun Jisheng was detained on the night of December 17th of last year, and although it was proven to be a wrongful detention on January 6th of this year, it was delayed until January 26th before Sun Jisheng was formally pronounced innocent. (2) I held old legal viewpoints that emphasized confessions and did not trust the opinions of the masses. When the judge concluded the case and sent it to me for approval, I also saw letters from the masses requesting the release of Sun Jisheng, but because I disregarded the opinions of the masses, I did not correct the error in a timely manner. (3) There was insufficient management and education of prisoners, which resulted in prisoners using "helping to confess" as a pretext to force Sun Jisheng to make false confessions. In addition to learning from this incident and improving our future work, we once again express our apologies to Comrade Sun Jisheng. (When the money was returned to Comrade Sun Jisheng, Zhang Fuqing, the head of the tribunal, was dispatched by our court to apologize and explain in person.)

    郑州市人民法院副院长张荣吉对错押孙际圣的检讨
    郑州市人民法院副院长张荣吉来信：三月二十二日人民日报刊载“郑州市人民法院应对错押孙际圣事件作检讨”一文后，我们马上召集了各庭庭长和处理该案有关的人员开会研究。从分析批判中，我们已认识到这一事件的严重性。我的主要错误是：
    （一）只听报告，不实际检查。尤其不应该的是，孙际圣于去年十二月十七日夜被押，今年一月六日已证明是错押了，但又拖延到一月二十六日才正式宣判孙际圣无罪。（二）重口供，不相信群众意见的旧法观点。当审判员审结该案送我批示时，我也看到了群众要求保出孙际圣的信，但因为我漠视了群众的意见，以致没有及早纠正错误。（三）对犯人的管理教育不够，以致犯人用“帮助坦白”为名，迫使孙际圣作了假供。我们除接受这一事件的教训改进今后的工作以外，并再一次向孙际圣同志表示道歉。（还款给孙际圣同志时，本院已派庭长张辅卿当面道歉并作了解释。）
