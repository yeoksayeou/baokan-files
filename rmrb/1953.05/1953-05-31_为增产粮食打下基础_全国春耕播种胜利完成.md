Xinhua News Agency report: The spring planting work in various parts of the country has now been successfully completed. During the spring plowing period, all regions made active efforts to lay a good foundation for increasing grain production this year.

The rice-producing areas on both sides of the Yangtze River and in the south mostly began sowing around Qingming (April 5th) and completed the transplanting of early and mid-season rice in the first and middle ten days of May. Late-season rice transplanting is now underway. Hainan Island, which is warm all year round, completed transplanting by the end of March and began harvesting rice in early May. According to the estimated yield of rice fields in Wanning County alone, production is expected to increase by 5% compared to last year. Early rice in Yunlong, Pu'er and other counties in Yunnan Province has already begun to head. In the miscellaneous grain producing areas north of the Yangtze River, spring wheat sowing ended in the first and middle ten days of April; corn, sorghum, millet, beans, etc. were sown in the middle and late ten days of April for earlier planting, and basically completed in the middle and late ten days of May for later planting. The rice planting area in East China increased by 2% compared to last year, and the planting area of miscellaneous grain crops also exceeded this year's planned target. The spring wheat area in the Houtao region of the Yellow River in Suiyuan Province increased by more than 157,000 mu compared to last year. The spring wheat area in Ningxia Province also increased by about 10% compared to previous years. Cotton-producing provinces such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang mostly completed planting from late April to mid-May, with later areas completing planting in late May.

During this year's spring plowing production, all regions implemented the policy of making spring plowing production the overriding central task in rural areas, changed the busy and chaotic phenomenon of many tasks, meetings, trainings, documents, instructions, and investigations in rural areas, and ensured that sowing was carried out without violating the agricultural season. In terms of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, all regions corrected the tendency of impatience and recklessness, implemented the policy of steady progress, promoted the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, resolutely protected the ownership of farmers' property from infringement, and greatly stimulated farmers' enthusiasm for production. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and the "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Spring Plowing Production" in late March, all regions organized cadres to conscientiously study these documents, thereby clarifying policy thinking, rationally arranging various tasks, conducting extensive publicity and education to farmers, and rectifying mutual aid and cooperation organizations according to different situations. After the rectification of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in North China, it is estimated that about a quarter of the agricultural production cooperatives that did not meet the conditions were transformed into mutual aid teams. During the spring plowing, the specific issues of agricultural loans, agricultural tool supply, and other policy issues in production in various regions were better resolved.

During this year's spring plowing production, various regions actively led farmers to build water conservancy projects, prevent drought, and combat drought, which also played a significant role in completing spring plowing and sowing in a timely manner. In the Southwest region, the construction and renovation of large and small water conservancy projects have ensured irrigation for 12.2 million mu of farmland. According to statistics at the end of April in the Northeast region, more than 50,000 new and renovated wells were drilled, which can irrigate more than 1.5 million mu of land. In addition to small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, the spring repair project of the Yangtze River embankment, which protects 5.8 million mu of farmland on both sides of the river downstream, will soon be completed. Due to scarce rain and snow last winter, drought appeared in some areas one after another since the beginning of spring. After mobilizing farmers to vigorously prevent and combat drought, and after widespread rainfall in mid-May, the drought situation in other provinces except Qinghai Province, where the drought situation is still relatively serious, has been basically relieved, enabling the smooth completion of spring plowing and sowing.

During spring plowing and sowing, various regions promoted advanced agricultural technologies such as close planting, which improved the level of cultivation. This year, many regions have applied the experience of Ren Guodong, Secretary of the CPC Guohouqi (formerly Zhaoyuan County) Committee, in leading farmers to increase production last year, the leadership method of "typical chain demonstration" in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, and the leadership method of "one station and three networks" in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province. Many regions have also held agricultural technology seminars and exhibitions, established agricultural technology guidance organizations, and run agricultural technology training classes, so that the production experience of farmers and scientific technology are combined, and promoted to the vast number of farmers through the method of key demonstrations and layer-by-layer instruction.

All regions have also made great efforts in preventing and controlling insect pests and fighting against disasters such as cold waves, late frost, hail, and wind.

At present, agricultural production work in various regions has shifted to the stage of checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, and protecting seedlings. The vast number of farmers are continuing to work hard to strive for increased grain and cotton production in the fall.

    为增产粮食打下基础
    全国春耕播种胜利完成
    据新华社讯：全国各地的春耕播种工作现已胜利完成。春耕期间，各地积极努力，为今年增产粮食打下了较好的基础。
    长江两岸和南方水稻产区，大多在清明（四月五日）前后开始播种，五月上、中两旬完成早稻、中稻插秧，现正进行晚稻插秧。终年温暖的海南岛在三月底就完成插秧工作，五月上旬开始割稻，仅据万宁县的稻田产量估计，可比去年增产百分之五。云南省云龙、普洱等县早稻已经抽穗。长江以北杂粮产区，春小麦在四月上、中两旬结束播种；玉米、高粱、谷子、豆类等，早的在四月中、下两旬就播种结束，迟的也在五月中、下两旬基本完成播种。华东区水稻播种面积比去年增加百分之二，杂粮作物播种面积也超过今年预定计划。绥远省黄河后套地区春小麦比去年多种十五万七千多亩。宁夏省春小麦也比往年多种百分之十左右。棉花产区陕西、山西、山东、河北、河南、江苏、安徽、浙江、江西、湖北、四川、辽东、辽西、甘肃、新疆等省大多在四月下旬到五月中旬种完，较迟的也在五月下旬种完。
    今年的春耕生产中，各地都贯彻了以春耕生产为农村压倒一切的中心任务的方针，改变了农村中任务多、会议多、训练多、文件指示和调查多的忙乱现象，作到了不违农时进行播种。在农业生产互助合作运动方面，各地都纠正急躁冒进的偏向，贯彻稳步前进的方针，宣传自愿互利的原则，坚决地保护了农民财产的所有权不受侵犯，大大发挥了农民生产的积极性。三月下旬，中共中央发表了关于农业生产互助合作的决议和关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示以后，各地都组织干部认真学习了这些文件，从而明确了政策思想，合理地安排了各项工作，向农民广泛地进行了宣传教育，并分别不同情况整顿了互助合作组织。华北区的互助合作组织经过整顿后，估计约有四分之一左右不够条件的农业生产合作社转成了互助组。春耕中，各地有关的农业贷款、农具供应等具体问题及生产中其他的政策问题，都获得较好的解决。
    今年春耕生产中，各地积极领导农民兴修水利，防旱抗旱，对及时完成春耕播种也起了很大作用。西南区已兴建和整修的大小水利工程，使一千二百二十万亩农田保证有水灌溉。东北区四月底统计，仅打新井和修旧井就有五万多眼，可浇地一百五十万亩以上。除小型农田水利工程外，长江下游保护两岸五百八十万亩农田的江堤春修工程，不久就可结束。由于去冬雨雪稀少，入春以来，部分地区先后呈现旱象。经过动员农民大力防旱抗旱，以及五月中旬普遍降雨以后，除青海省旱象仍较严重外，其他各省旱象都已基本解除，使春耕播种顺利结束。
    春耕播种中，各地推广密植等先进农业技术，提高了耕作的水平。去年中共郭后旗（原肇源县）委员会书记任国栋领导农民增产的经验、江苏省松江县“典型连环示范”的领导方法和山西省武乡县
    “一站三网”的领导方法，今年已有不少地区加以运用。不少地区还举行农业技术研究会、展览会，建立农业技术指导组织和开办农业技术训练班，使农民群众的生产经验与科学技术结合起来，并经过重点示范、层层传授的办法，向广大农民推广。
    在防治虫害，与寒流、晚霜、雹、风等灾害作斗争方面，各地也都作了很大努力。
    现在，各地农业生产工作已转入查苗、补苗和保苗阶段。广大农民正在为争取秋季粮棉增产而继续努力。
