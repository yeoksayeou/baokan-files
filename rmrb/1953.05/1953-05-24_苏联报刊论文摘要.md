Soviet Newspaper Article Abstracts
    Writers and Criticism
    The "Literary Gazette" published an editorial on May 7th entitled "Writers and Criticism," pointing out the great significance of criticism in raising the creative level of writers.
    The abstract is as follows:
    If criticism is bold and fair, strict and well-intentioned, if it proceeds from an advanced ideological standpoint and relies on knowledge of life, then it is always fruitful and beneficial, even if the criticism is often sharp and even painful.
    Acknowledging and considering one's mistakes leads to creative upsurge and achievement. When Maxim Gorky read Lenin's stern, angry letter, he felt pain. In that letter, Lenin, who so appreciated the famous writer, ruthlessly exposed his ideological errors. However, the truly great writer Gorky found the strength to understand and accept the criticism. Lenin's criticism was invaluable to him and charted the path for his further creative work.
    Demyan Bedny felt pain when the Party's newspapers harshly criticized his ideologically flawed works, and when Joseph Stalin condemned him for his intolerance of criticism. The poet was able to change his views and overcome his mistakes well.
    The history of Fadeyev's "The Young Guard" is an excellent example. He correctly, in the spirit of the Party, accepted the harsh criticism in the Party's newspapers. After deeply considering these criticisms, he spent several years rewriting the novel, overcoming the shortcomings of the first edition.
    It must be pointed out that by no means all writers pay attention to criticism. Some writers do not pay attention to individual criticisms in articles and reviews, especially when the overall evaluation of the work is positive. They rest on their laurels and do not make a special effort to eliminate even the smallest shortcomings in their supposedly successful works. They repeatedly republish their books without making them more perfect.
    Sometimes writers forget that correction, supplementation, and multiple authorial reviews are one of the noble traditions of our great classical writers. The classical writers tirelessly and strictly worked to perfect their works; they also forgot the experience of the great Soviet writers. It should be known that Gorky often revisited the original manuscript of his world-renowned novel "Mother" and constantly revised various works in preparation for republication. Alexei Tolstoy put a lot of effort into revising his trilogy and "Peter the Great" when new editions were published. Mikhail Sholokhov made many revisions in the new edition of "Virgin Soil Upturned."
    Not only newspaper and critic criticism, but also broad reader opinion, plays a major role in improving writers’ creative work. If a writer does not listen to readers' opinions, does not participate in reader discussions about his works, and does not answer readers' letters, then he will make a serious mistake and, first of all, cause great losses to his creative work.
    If the writer is willing to be with the people, willing to participate in the construction of communism, and willing to become a true engineer of human souls, then the opinions of readers and the literary community cannot but make him pay attention and feel moved.
    Neither petty ego, nor personal grievances, nor displeasure caused by the failure of a work should prevent a writer from honestly and frankly accepting the harshest criticism and revising his works.
    On the other hand, if a writer believes that he has not made a mistake, if a writer agrees with some correct criticisms but rejects other incorrect and subjective criticisms, he has the right to refute and prove that he is correct. Because creative discussions and debates of various opinions are necessary for the development of our art.

    The People's Teacher
    The "Pravda" published an editorial on May 10th entitled "The People's Teacher," the abstract of which is as follows:
    The labor of the people's teacher is respected and cared for in the Soviet state. Our country places the people's teacher at a height that has never been and cannot be reached in any capitalist country.
    In the Soviet Union, people's teachers enjoy many benefits. They receive orders and medals for long and irreproachable work. Thousands of teachers have received the highest honor and trust—being elected to the highest and local organs of state power. Hundreds of the best school teachers have received the honorary title of Honored Teacher.
    Teachers in our country perform the glorious task of educating children. They are conductors of communist thought, tireless cultural and educational workers, and social and political activists. They bring their knowledge and life experience to the people. They understand that the activities of every cultural worker in the Soviet Union are not a private matter, but a national and all-people’s cause. The Communist Party has in the past and now educates teachers in the spirit of Marxist-Leninist thought, cultivates in them an uncompromising spirit against reactionary bourgeois theories, and guides them to successfully achieve the task of communist education for the younger generation.
    The 19th Party Congress set major tasks for Soviet schools. Its mission is to cultivate well-rounded, educated people who have a good grasp of the basics of science, and to cultivate courageous, honest, principled people who are infinitely loyal to the cause of communism. Soviet schools should create conditions for students to freely choose their professions.
    Successfully achieving these tasks requires teachers to have high culture, knowledge in all aspects, high communist morality, a creative attitude towards educational work, and flexible application of pedagogy. Teachers should strictly abide by the requirements of Soviet pedagogy and insist on striving to improve the preparation and teaching quality of each course. In the struggle to ensure that students acquire solid knowledge, the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations are the teachers' reliable helpers. Teachers should maintain contact with them at all times and strive to develop students' independence. But phenomena such as students copying, doing exercises, and reviewing lessons at Young Pioneers meetings should not be encouraged. Such gatherings are essentially a continuation of classes and do not achieve the purpose of education.
    Local Party organizations and Soviet organizations should constantly care about improving teachers' political awareness and pedagogical quality, do their best to help them, and be sensitive to their daily needs and demands.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    作家和批评
    “文学报”五月七日发表以“作家和批评”为题的社论，指出批评对提高作家的创作水平的重大意义，
    摘要如下：
    如果批评是大胆而公平，严格而善意的，如果批评从先进的思想立场出发并且依靠生活的知识，那末，它总是富有成果和有益的，虽然批评往往尖刻，甚至会使人感到痛苦。
    承认和考虑自己的错误会引向创作的高涨和成就。马克西姆·高尔基读到列宁给他的那封严厉的、愤怒的信时，他曾经感到痛苦，在这封信里，那样赏识这位著名作家的列宁，无情地揭露了他的思想上的错误。但是，这位真正伟大的作家高尔基找到了力量，并明白了，接受了批评。列宁的批评对于他是一种无可评价的帮助，而且规定了他的进一步创作的道路。
    当党的报刊严厉地批评了杰米扬·别德内依的有思想错误的作品和约·维·斯大林为了他不能容忍批评而谴责他的时候，他曾经感到痛苦。诗人能够改变自己的观点，能够很好地克服自己的错误。
    法捷耶夫的“青年近卫军”的历史就是一个极好的借镜。他正确地，根据党的精神接受了党的报刊上的严厉批评。在深刻地考虑了这些批评后，他用了几年的时间来改写这部小说，克服了第一版中的缺点。
    必须指出，远非所有的作家都注意批评。有些作家不注意论文和评论中的个别地方的批评，特别是当对作品的总评价是肯定的时候。他们安于成就，而不去特别仔细地消灭被认为成功的作品中的最小缺点，他们屡次再版自己的书，而不使它们更加完善起来。
    有时作家忘记了改正、补充和作者的多次校阅——这是我们伟大的古典作家的高贵传统之一。古典作家们是不倦地严格地使自己的作品更臻完善的；他们也忘记了苏维埃大作家的经验。要知道，高尔基经常回顾他那获有世界荣誉的小说“母亲”的原稿，并不断地修改准备再版的各种作品。阿·托尔斯泰在他的三部曲和“彼得大帝”出版新的版本时，曾费很多功夫加以修改。米·萧洛霍夫在新版的“被开垦的处女地”中作了不少的修正。
    在提高作家的创作中起着重大作用的，不仅有报刊和批评家的批评，而且还有广大的读者舆论。如果一个作家不听取读者的意见，不参加有关他的作品的读者讨论会，不回答读者的来信，那么他就会犯重大的错误，首先会给自己的创作带来巨大损失。
    如果这位作家愿意和人民在一起，愿意参加共产主义的建设，愿意成为真正的人类灵魂的工程师，那么读者的意见，文学界的意见就不能不使他注意和激动。
    无论是微小的自尊心，无论是个人的委屈和因作品失败而引起的不快，都不应当阻碍作家诚实地和坦白地接受最严厉的批评和修改自己的作品。
    从另一方面来说，如果一个作家相信他没有犯错误，如果一位作家同意一部分正确的批评，拒绝另一部分不正确的、主观的批评，他有权利反驳和证明自己的正确。因为创作的讨论、各种意见的论战，对于我们艺术的发展是必要的。
    人民的教师
    “真理报”五月十日发表以“人民的教师”为题的
    社论，摘要如下：
    人民教师的劳动在苏维埃国家受到最大的尊敬和关怀。我国把人民教师放在这样的高度：在任何一个资本主义国家中过去和现在都没有、也不可能有过的高度。
    在苏联，人民教师享有许多优待。他们由于长期的和无可责难的工作而获得勋章和奖章。数千教师得到最高的光荣和信任——被选入国家政权的最高机关和地方机关。几百名最优秀的学校教师，得到功勋教师的光荣称号。
    教师在我国执行着教育儿童的光荣任务，他们是共产主义思想的传导者，是不倦地进行文化教育工作和社会政治工作的社会活动家。他们把自己的知识和生活经验带给人民，他们理解到苏联每一个文化工作者的活动不是私人的事情，而是国家的和全民的事业。共产党过去和现在以马克思列宁主义思想的精神教育教师们，使他们养成对于反动的资产阶级理论的不妥协精神，引导他们成功地实现对青年一代的共产主义教育的任务。
    第十九次党代表大会给苏联学校提出了重大任务。它的使命是培养全面发展的、很好地掌握了科学基础的受过教养的人，培养勇敢的、诚实的、具有原则性和无限忠实于共产主义事业的人。苏维埃学校应该给学生们创立自由选择职业的条件。
    成功地实现这些任务，要求教师有高度文化，各方面的知识，高度的共产主义道德，对待教育事业的创造性态度以及对教育学的灵活运用。教师应该严格遵守苏维埃教育学的要求，坚持为提高每一课程的准备和讲授质量而斗争。在争取使学生获得牢固知识的斗争中，青年团和少先队组织是教师的可靠助手。教师应当时时和它们保持联系，尽力发展学生的独立自主性。但是不应当鼓励学生在少先队集会上默写、做习题和温习功课等现象。这种集会实质上是继续上课，达不到教育的目的。
    地方党组织和苏维埃组织应该不断关怀提高教师的政治觉悟和教育学的素养，尽力帮助他们，敏锐地对待他们的日常需要和要求。
