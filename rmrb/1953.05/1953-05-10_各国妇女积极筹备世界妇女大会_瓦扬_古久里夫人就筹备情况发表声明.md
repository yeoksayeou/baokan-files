Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 8th: Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation, issued a statement on the 5th regarding preparations for the World Women's Congress around the world, saying: "The number of countries responding to the call for the World Women's Congress and the enthusiasm and initiative shown in the preparations have exceeded our expectations. In addition to the sixty-five countries with national women's organizations participating in the Women's International Democratic Federation, another fifteen countries have declared their intention to send delegations to the Congress."

    "Countries in Asia and Africa are particularly interested and enthusiastic in responding to the Congress. Eight African countries will be sending delegations to an international women's conference for the first time. In Asia, Vietnamese representatives and thirty representatives from India have already departed. Indian women have written to us saying that if it were not for economic difficulties, they could easily select one hundred representatives."

    "In countries where women have already gained certain rights, such as France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries, it is becoming increasingly clear that even the rights they have obtained are being undermined by war preparations. Women must fight to maintain existing rights and strive for more rights. Women in these countries hope to come to Copenhagen and meet women from all over the world, especially those from countries where women legally and practically enjoy equal rights. The preparations for the Congress have further promoted the struggle of women in these countries to fight for their rights."

    "The new proposals by the Chinese and Korean governments regarding the cessation of the Korean War have provided new hope for peace. However, the delay in the armistice negotiations makes women deeply feel that women must make greater efforts to ensure peace. At this Congress, women will have the opportunity to contribute to peace—to stop the war."

    "Another important development in the preparations is that the will of women in various countries to participate in the Congress is overcoming all difficulties. Women in Japan, the United States, and Latin American countries are making every effort to attend. The fact that Japan will have thirteen representatives participating in an international women's conference for the first time proves that it is impossible to isolate the people of different countries. As a letter from the United States says: 'One of the most important achievements of the Congress will be the establishment of dear, cooperative, and lasting friendly relations among women who are working together for the benefit of women around the world. Women believe that this Congress will be a major step forward in international understanding.'"

    各国妇女积极筹备世界妇女大会
    瓦扬——古久里夫人就筹备情况发表声明
    【新华社柏林八日电】国际民主妇联总书记玛丽·克洛德·瓦扬—古久里夫人于五日就世界各地筹备世界妇女大会的情况发表声明说：响应召开世界妇女大会的国家数目之多和筹备工作所表现的热烈情绪和主动行动，都超过我们预料。现在，除了有全国性妇女团体参加国际民主妇联的六十五个国家之外，另有十五个国家已声明要派代表团来参加大会。
    亚洲和非洲的国家对大会特别感觉兴趣并热烈响应，非洲有八个国家将第一次派遣代表团参加国际性的妇女会议。在亚洲方面，越南代表和印度三十个代表已经起程，印度的妇女们写信给我们说：如果不是因为经济上的困难，她们可以很容易地选出一百个代表来。
    在妇女已经获得某些权利的国家里，如法国、意大利、英国和斯堪的纳维亚国家，她们越来越清楚地看到：就是她们已得到的一些权利正受到战争准备的打击。妇女们必须以斗争来保持现有的权利，并争取更多的权利。这些国家的妇女们希望来哥本哈根和来自全世界各地的妇女们见面，特别是和来自妇女已在法律上和实际上享有平等权利的国家的妇女们见面，大会的准备工作已进一步推动了这些国家妇女们争取自己的权利的斗争。
    中国和朝鲜政府关于停止朝鲜战争的新建议已为和平提供了新的希望。可是停战谈判的拖延使妇女们深深地感到：妇女必须以更大的努力来保证和平。在这个大会上，妇女们将有机会对和平有所贡献——制止战争。
    筹备工作中的另一重要发展是：各国妇女们要参加大会的意志正在克服着一切困难，日本、美国和拉丁美洲国家的妇女们正在竭力设法到会。日本将有十三位代表第一次来参加国际性妇女大会，这一事实证明要把各国人民隔离开来是办不到的。正如一封自美国的来信所说：“作为大会的最重要成就之一的，就是将在为了全世界妇女利益而共同努力的妇女们之间，建立起亲爱的、合作的和持久友好的关系，妇女们认为这个大会将使国际谅解迈进一大步。”
