Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 25th. The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Armistice Talks issued the following communiqué on May 25th:

Following an eight-day adjournment at the request of the other side, the plenary session of both delegations reconvened at 11:00 a.m. on May 25th.

The other side stated at the meeting that, after studying the various proposals and past statements made by both sides, they were prepared to put forward a new proposal. However, in order to allow both sides to conduct free discussions, it was suggested that both delegations immediately enter into administrative sessions. Chief Delegate General Nam Il of our side pointed out that since the other side believed that the form of secret administrative sessions would be conducive to the progress of the meeting, our side agreed that the plenary session of the delegation should take the form of administrative sessions. However, it was stated that should either party deem it necessary to terminate the administrative sessions, the plenary session of both delegations should immediately enter into open sessions.

Both sides then entered into administrative sessions, and finally, at the suggestion of the other side, it was decided that the plenary session of both delegations would adjourn for six days, to reconvene at 11:00 a.m. on June 1st.

    【新华社开城二十五日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月二十五日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团大会在对方的请求下休会八天之后五月二十五日上午十一时复会。
    对方在会上首先表示，对方在研究了双方所已提出的各个方案和历次声明之后，准备提出一个新方案。但为使双方能自由地进行讨论，建议双方代表团立即进入行政性会议。我方首席代表南日大将指出：既然对方认为秘密的行政性会议的形式有助于会议的进展，我方同意代表团大会采取行政性会议的形式。但愿声明，在任何一方认为有必要终止行政性会议时，双方代表团大会应即进入公开会议。
    双方继即进入行政性会议，最后并在对方建议下，决定双方代表团大会休会六天，至六月一日上午十一时复会。
