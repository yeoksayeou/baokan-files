    To the World Federation of Trade Unions, Vienna:
    As the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions draws to a close, let us, on behalf of all members of the Chinese Trade Unions, extend our respects to the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has successfully completed its mission, and the Chinese workers' movement will henceforth enter a new historical period of struggle to strive for national industrialization.
    This congress not only demonstrated the strong unity of our country's working class and further consolidated the alliance between our country's working class, peasants, and intellectuals, but also, thanks to the guidance of the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation headed by Comrade Louis Saillant, and thanks to the attendance of delegations from the trade unions of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, as well as trade union delegations from many countries in Asia, Europe, Australia, and Africa, it also demonstrated the great friendship and unity between the Chinese working class and the international working class.
    This congress clearly stipulated the tasks of the Chinese trade unions in the international workers' movement. We warmly endorse the resolution of the World Federation of Trade Unions regarding the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress, and have elected delegates to attend the congress. The Chinese trade unions will continue to support all activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and strive for the unity and solidarity of the international workers' movement.
    All Representatives of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, May 11, 1953

    向世界工会联合会致敬电维也纳世界工会联合会：
    当中国工会第七次全国代表大会闭幕之际，让我们代表中国工会全体会员向世界工会联合会致敬。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会，胜利地完成了它的使命，中国工人运动也将从此进入为争取国家工业化而斗争的新的历史时期。
    这次大会不仅表现了我国工人阶级的坚强的团结，进一步巩固了我国工人阶级和农民与知识分子的联盟，而且由于以路易·赛扬同志为首的世界工会联合会代表团的光临指导，由于苏联工会和人民民主国家工会代表团以及亚洲、欧洲、澳洲、非洲的很多国家的工会代表团莅临参加，也表现了中国工人阶级和国际工人阶级之间的伟大友谊和团结。
    这次大会明确规定了中国工会对国际工人运动的任务，我们热烈拥护世界工会联合会关于召开世界工会第三次代表大会的决议，并选出了出席大会的代表。中国工会将继续支持世界工会联合会的一切活动，为国际工人运动的统一和团结而奋斗。
