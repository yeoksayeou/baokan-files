The reply stated: The Romanian People's Republic, representing the Romanian people, expresses its deep enthusiasm for the cause of peace and cooperation among nations, welcomes the proposal of the World Peace Congress, and firmly believes that if the five major powers reach an agreement and conclude a peace pact, it can end the current international tensions and avoid the danger of another war and new disasters for mankind.
    The Government of the Romanian People's Republic is convinced that all contentious issues can be resolved through consultations and agreements reached by the countries concerned based on sincere desires for peace, which will strengthen world peace and international security.
    The Romanian people are engaged in a great construction effort to continuously improve their material and cultural standards. They have a vested interest in the victory of the noble cause of peace, and they will dedicate all their creative energy to this cause. The Government of the Romanian People's Republic recognizes the responsibility borne by every country in the struggle for peace and resolutely supports your actions for peace and international security.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: According to TASS, the people of France, Austria, and Brazil are launching a movement to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.
    The Executive Bureau of the French National Peace Council has written to French Prime Minister Mayer, demanding that the French government state its position on the issue of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The letter stated: "The International Committee of the World Peace Congress sent a letter to the French government and other relevant governments on March 27th, suggesting that the five major powers hold negotiations to conclude a peace pact. Now, the replies from other national governments have been published. The French people do not understand why the French government remains silent. The French people have the right to know the government's intentions, and the government has a responsibility to clearly explain its intentions to the people." The Peace Committees of Seine and Seine-et-Oise held a meeting in Paris on April 29th. Émile Dastier de la Vigerie, a member of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech at the meeting, emphasizing the importance of the fact that the Soviet and Chinese governments have successively expressed their support for the suggestion of the International Committee of the World Peace Congress to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact. The meeting passed a resolution pointing out the need to launch a nationwide movement in France to make the French government answer the letter from the International Committee of the World Peace Congress without delay.
    The Austrian Peace Council has issued a circular to peace committees throughout Austria, requesting that a movement be launched throughout Austria from June 8th to 14th to explain to the Austrian people that peace can be maintained if understanding is reached between the major powers and a peace pact is concluded. The circular stated: A Five-Power Peace Pact would be the most reliable guarantee of lasting and just peace between nations.
    The Brazilian Women's Federation has written to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting him to make every effort to promote the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The letter stated that more than five million people in Brazil have signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. Ending the Cold War and resolving existing differences of opinion between the governments of major powers will eliminate the shadow of war threatening us and will bring peace and cooperation between nations. We call on all member states of the United Nations to participate in the powerful movement to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: TASS, Cairo: The "Egyptian Gazette" published an editorial on April 30th entitled "Peace Pact," commenting on the Soviet Union's efforts to safeguard world peace. The editorial said: "On April 27th, Molotov stated that his government is willing to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact and is willing to hold negotiations to achieve this goal. This suggestion is noteworthy and should be implemented."
    The "Egyptian Gazette" wrote that Western countries "always say they welcome every step toward peace." "Now the whole world is watching these steps toward peace with optimism, hoping and demanding that those who call for peace turn words into action. Humanity wants long-term stability and peace to concentrate on raising living standards, not on concentrating on expanding armaments."
