Review of Events Involving Waste of Civilian Labor

On April 13th and 16th, the "Reader's Letters Summary" column published readers' criticisms of the waste of civilian labor by the Rural Production Office of Lingbi County, Anhui Province, and the Grain Bureau of Zhengyang County, Henan Province, during the spring plowing season. The following are excerpts of the review reports from the aforementioned agencies.

The Rural Production Office of Lingbi County wrote: "The fact that disaster victims in Louzhuang District had to make two fruitless trips to collect relief grain was due to our lack of seriousness and responsibility in our work. In mid-March, the higher authorities allocated 3 billion yuan in relief funds. We were supposed to purchase grain and bean cakes from the county Grain Bureau and cooperatives to distribute to the disaster victims, including 30,000 catties of bean cakes and 100,000 catties of autumn grain for Louzhuang District. When contacting the cooperative to purchase bean cakes, we did stipulate that moldy bean cakes should not be distributed to the disaster victims; however, after the purchase, we failed to supervise the cooperative's inspection. On March 20th, when Louzhuang District sent ox carts to collect the bean cakes according to the notice, it was only after opening the warehouse that the bean cakes were found to be moldy, causing the ox carts to make a fruitless trip. On March 31st, when Louzhuang District came to the Grain Bureau to collect grain according to the notice, although we had contacted the Grain Bureau a few days earlier, we subsequently failed to maintain contact with the Grain Bureau to keep abreast of the grain supply situation, resulting in the Grain Bureau selling off its stock, and the ox carts from Louzhuang District making two fruitless trips. As the leading agency for rural production, it is unacceptable for us to waste civilian labor during the spring plowing and planting season. We are determined to strengthen our sense of responsibility in future work. In addition, the county Grain Bureau and cooperative's failure to strictly adhere to and implement the matters agreed upon in advance was also a cause of the waste of civilian labor. We have already informed them to conduct a review."

The Zhengyang County Grain Bureau wrote: "The reason for the incident in which disaster victims from the third district of our county went to Queshan County to transport grain and returned empty-handed was due to bureaucracy in our bureau's work. Our county faced a grain shortage due to the spring disaster, and at the end of February, there was heavy rain and muddy roads, making it impossible to transport grain from other counties in a timely manner. With the approval of the County Finance Committee, our bureau took emergency measures, dispatching cadres to various districts to organize manpower to carry grain. Among them, the allocation to the third district was to carry 40,000 catties of red sorghum from Queshan. Our bureau failed to coordinate properly with the Queshan Grain Depot before sending cadre Guo Qiwen to notify the district to organize disaster victims. On February 28th, we learned that Queshan County had already organized local people to transport the grain, and we notified the district that evening. The district did not immediately notify the villages, so the next morning (March 1st), the people of the district set off. Because the grain-carrying disaster victims did not depart collectively, those who left first returned after arriving in Queshan because there was no grain to transport. Some people who heard the news on the way also returned; 120 disaster victims who traveled with Guo Qiwen instead went to another grain depot and carried grain. Some of the disaster victims who returned empty-handed did not bring enough dry food and had to pawn their belongings to buy food along the way. We have now decided to compensate each of the disaster victims who returned empty-handed with 5,000 yuan for food expenses (a total of 330 people), redeem the belongings they pawned and sold along the way, and send cadres to the local area to apologize to the masses. We will definitely learn from this lesson and improve our work style in the future."

### 对浪费民力事件的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对浪费民力事件的检讨
    四月十三日和十六日，“读者来信摘要”栏先后刊载了读者对安徽省灵璧县农村生产办公室和河南省正阳县粮食局在春耕生产期间浪费民力的批评。现将上述两机关的检讨摘要发表于后。
    灵璧县农村生产办公室来信说：“娄庄区灾民领救济粮时，两次徒劳往返；这是我们工作不够严肃负责所致。三月中旬，上级拨来三十亿元救济款，我们当向县粮食局和合作社购买粮食和豆饼发给灾民，其中分配给娄庄区的有三万斤豆饼、十万斤秋粮。我们在与合作社接洽购买豆饼时，虽曾提出霉烂豆饼一律不能发给灾民；但购妥后就未督促合作社进行检查。三月二十日娄庄区按通知派牛车来领取豆饼时，开仓后才发觉豆饼霉烂，使牛车徒劳往返。三月三十一日娄庄区按通知来粮食局领粮，我们虽在前几天和粮食局联系过，但其后就未随时与粮食局联系，掌握粮食供应情况，以致粮食局存粮售出，娄庄区来的牛车两次徒劳往返。我们农村生产的领导机关，在春耕春种期间浪费民力，这是不能容许的。我们决心在今后工作中加强责任心。此外，县粮食局和合作社对双方预先约定的事项未能严格遵守执行，也是造成民力浪费的原因。我们已转告他们进行检查。”
    正阳县粮食局来信说：“我县三区灾民到确山县运粮扑空事件的发生原因，是我局工作中有官僚主义。我县春灾中粮食不足，而二月末天气多雨，道路泥泞，外县粮食不能及时运入。经县财委同意，我局采取紧急措施，抽干部到各区组织人力担运粮食。其中分配给三区的是从确山担运四万斤红粮。我局和确山粮库未联系好，就派干部郭启文通知该区组织灾民。二月二十八日，我们得知确山县已组织当地群众运送的讯息，当晚通知该区。该区没有立即通知各乡，因此，第二天（三月一日）清晨该区群众就动身了。因为运粮灾民不是集中出发的，先动身的到确山后因没有粮运而回来了，有一部分人在途中听到讯息也回来了；和郭启文同走的灾民则有一百二十人改到另一粮库担到了粮。扑空的灾民有的干粮带得不够，途中还押了东西买饭吃。我们现在决定偿付扑空的灾民伙食费每人五千元（共三百三十人），代灾民赎回途中押卖的东西，并派干部到当地向群众道歉。今后我们一定接受这个教训，改进工作作风。”
