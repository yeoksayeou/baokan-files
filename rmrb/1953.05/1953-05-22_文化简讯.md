	Han Chinese Cadres in Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region Study Tibetan Language
	Over 1,100 Han Chinese cadres from the first-level organs of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region and the Kangding County level began studying Tibetan language and script in classes in early May. Miao Fengshu, Secretary of the Kangding Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Chunfang, Deputy Secretary, and leading cadres from various organs are all participating in this formalized study. The Autonomous Region People's Government specifically established a Kangding On-the-Job Cadre Tibetan Language and Script Learning Committee. Each class has Tibetan personnel proficient in the Tibetan language to serve as professors, and they study twice a week. They plan to learn an average of one Tibetan sentence per day, and to learn the 30 Tibetan letters and phonetics in May and June. At the Tibetan language learning mobilization meeting held before the start of classes, Li Chunfang, Deputy Secretary of the Kangding Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, emphasized that Han Chinese cadres should humbly learn from Tibetan people. Awang Jiacuo (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, also called on Tibetan cadres to wholeheartedly help Han Chinese cadres in this study.
	
	First Secondary School Established in Turpan, Xinjiang
	The first secondary school in the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang has been established in Turpan County. The Turpan Basin includes Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun counties. In the past, there was no secondary school, and after completing primary school education, most of the children of the Uyghur people had no opportunity to study, except for a few students from wealthy families who went to study in Dihua City, nearly 400 li away. In 1952, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government allocated funds to build Turpan Middle School. This spring, 250 young men and women have enrolled, more than 170 of whom enjoy full public funding. Turpan Middle School has twelve classrooms, more than forty dormitories, as well as a library, dining hall, etc., and a large sports field and campus. The classrooms are built according to the unique climate of Turpan, with fireplaces for winter and cellars to adapt to the hot climate. Recently, the climate in Turpan has been very hot, and students have been going to the cellars to review their lessons and hold discussions.

    新疆吐鲁番成立第一所中等学校
    新疆吐鲁番盆地第一所中等学校已在吐鲁番县成立。吐鲁番盆地包括吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊三县，过去没有一所中等学校，维吾尔族人民的子弟在受完小学教育后，除了少数家境富裕的学生到近四百里地的迪化市去读书外，绝大多数的学生都没有求学的机会。一九五二年新疆省人民政府拨款修建了吐鲁番中学。今年春天已有二百五十个男女青年入学，其中一百七十多名享受全部公费的待遇。吐鲁番中学有十二座教室、四十多间宿舍以及图书馆、饭厅等，还有宽大的运动场和校园。教室是根据吐鲁番特有的气候建筑的，室内有过冬的壁炉设置，室下有适应酷热气候的地窖。最近吐鲁番的气候已十分炎热，学生们都下地窖温习功课、开讨论会。
