The No. 501 Factory of the Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry urgently needs to immediately launch a mass movement against waste and to establish a responsibility system.

According to the investigation by the inspection team of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the working group of the No. 501 Factory of the Non-Ferrous Metal Industry Bureau, the factory currently has widespread and serious waste and a phenomenon of no one being responsible. A large amount of materials are being stockpiled. Among the materials in stock, materials worth 35 billion yuan will not be used this year. According to the statistics in April, due to no one being responsible during construction, there were 190 major and minor quality accidents and 58 personal accidents. Because the relevant cadres shirked responsibility from each other, two projects were delayed by a month. Because Party A and Party B shirked responsibility in material work, oxygen was interrupted for 20 days, which seriously affected the construction period. In the first quarter, the losses caused by rework waste, material waste, a large amount of work stoppage, work-related injuries, and fires were no less than 500 million yuan. Cement, lime, and sand were scattered everywhere. According to the estimation of the first team of the factory, 30,000 kilograms of cement and more than 20,000 kilograms of steel bars were missing in the first quarter. However, the riveting workshop has 161 iron plates that no one knows where they came from. It often happens on the construction site that workers of various types of work compete for the working surface, and work is stopped and waiting because no one is responsible for solving the problem.

However, due to the inconsistent understanding and uncoordinated steps of the leading cadres of the factory on the above phenomena, they have not yet actively mobilized the masses to carry out the anti-waste and establishment of the responsibility system movement. On May Day, Su Jiguang, the secretary of the factory's Party committee and director of the factory, called on the conference to carry out this movement. After the meeting, all the workers in the factory were very enthusiastic and asked the leaders to have a beginning and an end, and not to start without finishing. However, more than half a month has passed since the mobilization and deployment, and not only has the masses not been fully mobilized, but the leaders' thinking is still very confused. Some leading cadres advocated establishing a responsibility system first and then conducting inspections, while others were afraid of problems occurring in the movement, believing that "the current problem is construction, not anti-waste" and that "exposure and criticism cannot solve the problem"; therefore, the movement was limited to studying the documents on the scope of responsibilities of the responsibility system. The workers are very dissatisfied with this. Workers in the riveting and welding workshop said: "It is impossible to eliminate waste without opposing waste. Only thorough exposure can alert everyone." Workers at the construction site said: "We are waiting for work and materials, and no one cares. We can't find them in the east, and we can't find them in the west. If we don't launch a struggle against no one being responsible, we will lose our jobs." Comrades in the materials department said: "We can't find the root cause of waste if we don't oppose it." Due to the incorrect direction of the movement, the morale of the masses is very low. Only a few people speak at meetings in some groups, and more than half of the people have not spoken at all after studying for half a month.

Based on the above situation, in order for the factory's movement to establish a responsibility system to be carried out normally, it is hoped that the leading cadres of the factory will unify their understanding in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, fully mobilize the masses in connection with the current work, expose and criticize the serious phenomenon of no one being responsible on the construction site, and gradually establish the responsibility system.

### 五○一厂建立责任制运动没有开展起来

    五○一厂建立责任制运动没有开展起来
    中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局五○一厂亟需立即开展群众性的反浪费和建立责任制运动。
    根据重工业部检查组和有色工业管理局五○一厂工作组了解，该厂目前存在着普遍而严重的浪费和无人负责现象。大量的物资被积压。在库存材料中今年用不上的材料即值三百五十多亿元。据四月份的统计，在施工中由于无人负责，发生大小质量事故一百九十次，人身事故五十八次。因为有关干部互相推诿，使二件工程推迟工期一月之久。因甲、乙双方在材料工作上推诿责任，氧气曾中断二十天，严重影响了工期。在第一季度，因返工浪费、材料浪费及大量窝工、工伤事故和火灾造成的损失不下五亿元。水泥、白灰、砂子遍地散失，据该厂第一大队估计，在第一季中就有三万公斤水泥，二万多公斤钢筋不知下落。而铆工场却有一六一块铁板不知从何而来。在工地经常发生各个工种的工人相互争夺工作面，因无人负责解决而停工等待的现象。
    但是由于该厂领导干部对上述现象的认识不一致、步调不统一，至今尚未积极发动群众开展反浪费与建立责任制运动。在“五一”时，该厂党委书记兼厂长苏继光曾在大会上号召开展这一运动，会后全厂职工劲头很大，要求领导有始有终，不要有头无尾。但是从动员布置到现在已过了半个多月，不仅未充分发动群众，而且领导思想还很混乱。有的领导干部主张先建立责任制然后再来检查，有的领导干部害怕在运动中发生乱子，认为“目前的问题是在建不在反”，“揭发批评是不能解决问题的”；因此，就把运动局限在学习责任制职责范围的文件上。职工对此甚为不满。铆焊工场工人说：“不反浪费要消灭浪费是不行的，只有彻底揭发才能警惕大家。”工地工人说：“我们等工待料没人管，东找也找不到，西找也找不到，再不开展反对无人负责斗争我们就要失业了。”材料科同志说：“不反就找不出浪费的根源。”由于运动方针不正确，群众情绪很消沉，有的组在开会时只有少数人发言，有的组学了半个月，还有半数以上的人根本没有讲过话。
    根据以上情况，为使该厂建立责任制运动能够正常开展，希望该厂领导干部根据重工业部的指示，统一认识，结合当前工作，充分发动群众，揭发批判存在于施工现场的严重无人负责现象，逐步地把责任制建立起来。
