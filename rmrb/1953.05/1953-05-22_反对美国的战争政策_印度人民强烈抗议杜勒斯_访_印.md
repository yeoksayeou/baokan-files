Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 21st: Following his activities in various Middle Eastern countries, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arrived in New Delhi, the capital of India, on the 20th. He was accompanied by Harold Stassen, Director of the U.S. Mutual Security Agency. As soon as Dulles set foot on Indian soil, he was immediately met with strong protests from the Indian people.

In New Delhi, many Indian people rushed to the airport to hold protest demonstrations against Dulles. The demonstrators waved black flags and held up signs. The signs bore slogans such as "War Monger Dulles, Go Home," "No Interference in Asia," "Asians Don't Fight Asians," and "Stop the Korean War." On the eve of Dulles' arrival in India, a grand mass rally was held in New Delhi to protest Dulles' "visit" to India. Indian Communist Party Member of Parliament A. K. Gopalan delivered a speech at the rally. On the 17th, approximately 10,000 people participated in a protest rally held at Gandhi Square. Representatives from the Communist Party of India, the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and the All India Forward Bloc jointly held a meeting in Delhi on the 18th and established the "Dulles Boycott Committee."

In Calcutta, the Communist Party and fourteen other left-wing political parties, trade unions, and mass organizations jointly organized a grand mass protest rally on the evening of the 20th. Participants placed portraits of Dulles in front of the Ochterlony Monument, and after the rally, formed a mile-long procession to Sirajuddaula Park, where they angrily burned those portraits of Dulles.

Citizens of Bombay also held a large-scale demonstration on the day of Dulles' arrival in India. The demonstrators formed a procession approximately seven miles long, marching all the way to the U.S. Consulate, angrily protesting Dulles' activities in India. Slogans such as "Dulles, Go Home!" and "Asians Don't Fight Asians!" were plastered on walls throughout Bombay.

Meanwhile, protest rallies and demonstrations were also held in East Punjab, Agra, Hyderabad, and other parts of India.

Even the Associated Press could not help but acknowledge this strong anti-American war policy and anti-war-monger Dulles sentiment among the Indian people. An Associated Press dispatch from New Delhi on the 19th stated: "Dulles personally has a low reputation in India -- even among Indian officials, many have sharply criticized his policies."

Progressive Indian newspapers published editorials on the 20th exposing Dulles' conspiracy in his "visit" to the Middle East and South Asia. They pointed out that Dulles' aim was to woo countries in these regions to participate in U.S. war plans.

    反对美国的战争政策
    印度人民强烈抗议杜勒斯“访”印
    【新华社新德里二十一日电】美国国务卿杜勒斯在到中东各国进行了活动以后，在二十日到达印度首都新德里。同行的有美国共同安全署署长史塔生。杜勒斯一踏上印度国土，就立即遭到印度人民的强烈抗议。
    在新德里，有许多印度人民赶到飞机场向杜勒斯举行抗议示威。示威群众打着黑旗，并拿着标语牌。标语牌上面写着：“战争贩子杜勒斯滚回去”、“不准干涉亚洲”、“亚洲人不打亚洲人”、“停止朝鲜战争”等口号。在杜勒斯到达印度的前夕，新德里举行了盛大的群众集会，抗议杜勒斯“访问”印度。印度国会共产党议员高普兰在会上发表了演说。十七日，约有一万人参加了在甘地广场举行的抗议大会。印度共产党、社会革命党和全印前进同盟等政党的代表十八日联合在德里举行会议，成立了“抵制杜勒斯委员会”。
    在加尔各答，共产党以及十四个其他左翼政党、工会和群众团体二十日晚联合组织了盛大的群众抗议大会。参加大会的人把杜勒斯的画像放在奥赫特洛尼纪念碑前，在大会结束后，排着长达一英里的队伍前往什拉汤纳达公园，愤怒地把那些杜勒斯的画像烧掉。
    孟买市民在杜勒斯到达印度的当天也举行了大规模的示威游行。示威群众排着约七英里长的队伍，一直走到美国领事馆前面，愤怒抗议杜勒斯到印度进行活动。孟买各处墙上都贴着“杜勒斯，滚回去！”“亚洲人不打亚洲人！”等标语。
    同时，东旁遮普省、亚格拉、海得拉巴以及印度其他地方也都举行了抗议大会和示威游行。
    印度人民这种强烈地反对美国战争政策和战争贩子杜勒斯的情绪，连美联社也不得不承认。美联社新德里十九日电说：“杜勒斯个人在印度的声望很低——即使在印度的官员中间，很多人都曾经很尖锐地批评过他的政策。”
    印度进步报纸在二十日发表社论，揭露杜勒斯这次“访问”中东和南亚的阴谋。它们指出，杜勒斯的目的是想拉拢这些地区的国家参加美国的战争计划。
