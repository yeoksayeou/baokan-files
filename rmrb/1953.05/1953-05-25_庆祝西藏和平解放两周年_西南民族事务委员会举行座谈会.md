The Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission invited Tibetan figures and Tibetan cadres in Chongqing, as well as representatives of other fraternal ethnic groups, to a symposium on the 23rd to warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Representatives from the Chongqing office of the Panchen Lama of Tibet and the visiting group from the Southwest Nationalities Institute, which recently arrived in Chongqing, also attended the symposium. Representatives of all fraternal ethnic groups present extended warm congratulations to the Tibetan people.

    Cheng Zijian, Deputy Director of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in his speech: Two years ago today, the Tibetan people were forever freed from imperialist aggression and bondage. This is a festival for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and a festival of great unity for all ethnic groups in our country. The peaceful liberation of Tibet encourages the Tibetan people to further consolidate internal unity and further strive to implement the agreement and build the frontier of the motherland. Sun Gebaton, Director of the Chongqing Office of the Panchen Lama of Tibet, said: The agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet is the foundation for the Tibetan people to develop political, economic, and cultural undertakings, and it is also the first step for the Tibetan people to move from darkness and suffering towards light and happiness. He said: Over the past two years, the religious beliefs of the Tibetan people have been respected by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all personnel entering Tibet. The PLA units stationed in Tibet have done a lot of work for the Tibetan people in developing production and trade, as well as in culture, education, and health. The Tibetan representatives present were very excited about the progress Tibet has made in all aspects over the past two years. They all vividly described the changes in the lives of the Tibetan people over the past two years, based on their own experiences. Bai Qiyong, a Tibetan youth who came from the Bomi area to study in the interior, said: "Our place used to be desolate, but now land reclamation and production are taking place everywhere. The highway is also about to be completed. This is the happiness brought to us by the peaceful liberation of Tibet over the past two years." Liang Juwu (Miao nationality), a member of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, said: The progress of the Tibetan people in the past two years proves that only in the friendly and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China can all minority ethnic groups develop. The symposium unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao at the end. (Xinhua News Agency)

    庆祝西藏和平解放两周年
    西南民族事务委员会举行座谈会
    西南民族事务委员会，于二十三日邀请在重庆的藏族人士和藏族干部及其他兄弟民族代表举行座谈会，热烈庆祝和平解放西藏办法的协议签订两周年。西藏班禅驻重庆办事处代表和最近来到重庆的西南民族学院参观团都派代表参加了座谈会。到会的各兄弟民族代表，一致向西藏人民致热忱的庆贺。
    西南民族事务委员会副主任委员程子健在发言中说：两年前的今天，西藏民族永远摆脱了帝国主义的侵略和束缚，这是西藏和平解放的节日，也是我国各兄弟民族大团结的节日。西藏的和平解放，鼓励着西藏人民更加巩固民族内部团结，进一步努力实现协议，建设祖国边疆。西藏班禅驻重庆办事处处长孙格巴顿说：和平解放西藏办法的协议是西藏人民发展政治、经济、文化事业的基础，也是西藏人民从黑暗和痛苦中走向光明和幸福的第一步。他说：过去两年来，西藏人民的宗教信仰得到入藏的中国人民解放军和所有工作人员的尊重。在发展生产和贸易以及文化教育卫生等方面，中国人民解放军入藏部队给西藏人民做了许多工作。到会的藏族代表对西藏两年来在各方面的进步感到十分兴奋。他们都以自己亲身体验的事实，生动地叙述了两年来西藏人民生活的变化。从波密地区来到内地学习的藏族青年白起勇说：“我们那里过去是一片荒凉，现在到处都在开荒生产了。公路也快要修通了。这都是西藏和平解放两年来给我们带来的幸福。”西南民族事务委员会委员梁聚五（苗族）说：从西藏人民两年来的进步，证明各少数民族只有在中华人民共和国各民族友爱合作的大家庭中，才能得到发展。座谈会最后一致通过了向毛主席致敬电。    （新华社）
