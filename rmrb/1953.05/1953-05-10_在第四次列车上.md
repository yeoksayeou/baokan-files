    On the Fourth Train
  　Jin Feng
    On the morning of April 28th, the fourth train from Shenyang to Beijing entered Shanhaiguan, and the whistle sounded happily, speeding south. The representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, returning to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, watched the front with joy and impatience, wishing they could arrive in Beijing at the next stop.
    Guo Enzhi, a first-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army, was taking out a commemorative book with signatures and inscriptions from famous combat heroes, model workers, and writers, and looking through it with Han Decai, a first-class meritorious pilot of the Volunteer Air Force. Suddenly, a burst of crisp laughter from a child came from the carriage. Guo Enzhi looked up and saw an old lady walking towards him with a child. The old lady was about fifty years old and looked like an ordinary, kind elderly person. The child was about two years old, sturdy and beautiful, with a rosy face and a pair of big, watery eyes that blinked and were especially endearing. Seeing such a lovely child of the motherland, Guo Enzhi couldn't help but reach out and pick him up. The shiny medals and badges on Guo Enzhi's chest had already caught the child's attention, and he immediately curiously touched them with his small hands. Seeing this, the old lady said with a smile, "Look at how many medals this uncle has, he must have done great deeds for us!" Guo Enzhi smiled, lifted the child up, and said, "These children should be even happier, and when they grow up, they will serve the country and wear even more medals. But they won't be won in battles, but in construction!" Guo Enzhi's words clearly touched the old lady's heart. She asked, "Are you going to Beijing?" Guo Enzhi nodded, and someone next to him immediately told her that these comrades were combat heroes of the Volunteer Army, returning to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" celebrations. The old lady became even more excited and said, "Oh, you're from the Volunteer Army! My second son is also in Korea." Han Decai, upon hearing that the old lady was a military dependent, apologized and quickly stood up, offering the old lady his seat. The old lady then enthusiastically began to describe her family. It turned out that the old lady's eldest son worked in the military engineering department, her second son had joined the Volunteer Army long ago and was now a battalion commander. She also had two younger brothers who had joined the revolution, one of whom was serving in the People's Air Force. When Han Decai heard that the old lady's family also had someone in the Air Force, he immediately said, "That's great, we're in the same profession, I also serve in the Volunteer Army Air Force."
    As Han Decai spoke, he took out candy to tease the child. The child giggled. Guo Enzhi held the child tightly, kissing him repeatedly, and said to the old lady, "The little brother is so cute! We are fighting in Korea for these cute children! What's his name?" Guo Enzhi turned to look at the child. The old lady replied, "His name is Jiang Jian." She immediately explained the origin of the name: "It means 'difficult' (艰苦的艰). This child was born in October 1950, just when the Volunteer Army went abroad to fight. His father said that the country was still in difficult times, so he named the child 'Jian.' But his pet name is 'Little Tiger.'"
    "Little Tiger!" Guo Enzhi said with joy and surprise, "What a coincidence, I fought the American devils fiercely in Korea, and my comrades called me 'Tiger.' I never thought I would hold a 'Little Tiger' as soon as I returned home." His words made everyone around him laugh.
    The old lady smiled even more broadly. Seeing these Volunteer Army soldiers, the old lady felt as if she were seeing her own sons. So, like a mother caring for her long-separated sons, she asked Guo Enzhi and Han Decai about their lives. The warmth and harmony they displayed were truly like a reunion of family members after a long separation. At this time, Little Tiger had also become familiar with them. He playfully called out and jumped around. Han Decai took out a notebook with a picture of Chairman Mao and pointed it out to Little Tiger, who became even happier and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    The old lady looked at her grandson, laughing, shouting, and carefree, and couldn't help but say to Guo Enzhi with emotion, "You're right, the children will be happy in the future. But when I think about the past, I was worried my whole life. Little Tiger's father and uncles were born during the warlord melee, and Little Tiger's grandfather died in the chaos of war. I took care of the two children alone, fleeing here and there. When the children grew a little older, the Japanese devils came, and the brothers both joined the resistance against Japan. I sent them away with tears in my eyes, and spent eight years alone at home. After much difficulty, we finally won the victory, but the damned Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war. It wasn't until the whole country was liberated that I breathed a sigh of relief, saw my eldest son, and he got married. Just as the family was about to start living together, the evil American imperialists invaded Korea and attacked our border. My second son, who hadn't had time to come home, joined the Volunteer Army and went out to fight again." At this point, the old lady paused, and the carriage became quiet, even Little Tiger listened obediently to his grandmother's words. The old lady sighed softly, pointed to her heart, and continued, "A mother's heart is broken for her children. When I hear the sound of gunfire, my heart sinks." At this moment, Little Tiger rushed over, opened his arms, and called out "Grandma," wanting his grandmother to hold him. The old lady stroked Little Tiger's head and said to Guo Enzhi, "I hope this child will not hear the sound of guns and cannons when he grows up."
    Looking at the old lady's kind and loving eyes, filled with a love for a peaceful life, and looking at Little Tiger's innocent and naive smile, Guo Enzhi felt as if he was facing not just a mother and child, but all the mothers and children of China, trusting and expecting him. He was so moved that he didn't know what to say...
    At this time, the loudspeaker announced, "The train is arriving at Tianjin East Station," and the representatives of the Volunteer Army prepared to disembark to receive the welcome of the people from all walks of life in Tianjin. The old lady stood up, clasped Guo Enzhi's and Han Decai's hands tightly, and said, "Children, take care of your health. When you see Chairman Mao in Beijing, say hello from this old woman. When you return to the front lines and see my son, tell him not to worry about the family, to kill more enemies, and to strive to earn merit and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao like you." Guo Enzhi picked up Little Tiger again, kissed his apple-like face tightly one more time, and reluctantly handed him back to the old lady, saying, "Old mother, don't worry, seeing you today is like seeing my own mother. I will remember every word you say. When we return to Korea, we will fight even better to protect you and Little Tiger, so that you will never hear the sound of guns and cannons." Han Decai added, "And so that you will never hear the sound of bombs." The old lady said repeatedly, "Thank you, thank you!" Little Tiger imitated his grandmother and shouted, "Thank you, thank you!" His crisp voice was soon drowned out by the sound of the train's whistle as it arrived at the station.

    在第四次列车上
  　金凤
    四月二十八日清晨，经沈阳开往北京的第四次列车进入了山海关，汽笛发出愉快的鸣叫，向南急驰。归国参加“五一”节观礼的志愿军代表们，个个怀着愉快而又焦急的心情，注视着前方，恨不得下一站就到北京。
    志愿军一级战斗英雄郭恩志正拿出上面有著名的战斗英雄、劳动模范和作家们签名题字的纪念本和志愿军空军一等功臣韩德彩一起翻看；突然，车厢里传来一阵小孩的清脆的笑声。郭恩志一抬头，只见迎面走来一位老太太，带着一个小孩子。老太太约莫五十岁光景，是一个普通的善良的老年人。孩子大约两岁左右，长得又结实，又漂亮，红润润的脸蛋衬着一对水汪汪的大眼睛，忽闪忽闪的，特别逗人喜爱。看到这样可爱的祖国的儿童，郭恩志情不自禁地伸手一把把他抱起来。郭恩志胸前耀眼的勋章和奖章早已引起孩子的注意，孩子马上就好奇地用小手去抚摸那些勋章和奖章了。老太太看到这等情景，笑着说道：“看这位叔叔挂着多少牌牌，给咱们立下多大的功呀！”郭恩志笑着，把孩子举起来，说道：“这些孩子们要更幸福，将来长大了替国家服务，要挂更多的勋章哩。不过那不会是打仗得来的，而是建设得来的了！”郭恩志的话显然打动了老太太的心。她问道：“你们是上北京去呀？”郭恩志点了点头，旁边的人马上告诉她，这些同志都是志愿军战斗英雄，回国到北京参加“五一”节观礼的。老太太听了越发兴奋了，激动地说：“噢，是志愿军，我二儿子也在朝鲜哩。”韩德彩一听说老太太是军属，抱歉地连忙站了起来，让老太太坐下。老太太就兴致勃勃地叙述起她的家庭来。原来老太太的大儿子在军事工程部门工作，二儿子早已参加了志愿军，现在当营长。她还有两个小叔也参加了革命，有一个是在人民空军服务。韩德彩听说老太太家里也有参加空军的，马上说：“那好极了，我们是同行，我也在志愿军空军中服务。”
    韩德彩一边说，一边就从身上取出糖来逗着孩子。孩子被逗得格格地笑起来。郭恩志紧紧抱着孩子，连连亲吻着他，对老太太说：“小弟弟真可爱，我们在朝鲜打仗，就是为了这些可爱的孩子！他叫什么名字？”郭恩志转过脸来看着小孩子。老太太回答说：“叫蒋艰。”马上她又解释起这个名字的来历：“就是艰苦的艰。这孩子是一九五○年十月生的，正是志愿军出国作战的时候。他爸爸说国家还在艰苦的时候，就给孩子起名叫‘艰’吧。不过他的乳名叫‘小老虎’。”
    “小老虎！”郭恩志又欣喜又惊讶地说：“真巧，我在朝鲜打美国鬼子打得狠，同志们都叫我‘老虎’，想不到一回国就抱住了一个‘小老虎’。”他的话引得周围的人都大笑起来。
    老太太更笑得合不拢嘴。老太太看到这些志愿军，真像看到自己亲儿子一样。于是好像母亲关心久别的儿子似地，向郭恩志和韩德彩问长问短。他们谈得那股亲热和谐的劲儿，真也像家人们久别重聚一样。这时，小老虎也玩得熟了。顽皮地叫着、跳着。韩德彩拿出有毛主席像的笔记本指给小老虎看，小老虎更乐了，就喊：“毛主席万岁！”
    老太太看着又笑又叫、无忧无虑的孙儿，不禁感慨地对郭恩志说：“你说得对，孩子们将来是幸福的。可是提起过去，我真是提心吊胆了一辈子，小老虎的爸爸、叔叔出世的时候正赶上军阀混战，小老虎的爷爷就在兵荒马乱中去世了。我一个人带着两个孩子，这里逃难、那里逃难。等孩子们稍大一点，日本鬼子又打来了，兄弟俩双双参加抗日去了。我含着眼泪送走他们，一个人在家里熬着，一熬就是八年。好容易盼胜利了，该死的国民党反动派又发动了内战。一直到全国解放，才舒了口气，见到了大儿子，也娶了媳妇。一家正要开始过团圆的日子，万恶的美帝国主义进攻朝鲜，打到咱们国境，没有来得及回家的老二又参加志愿军出去打仗了。”说到这里，老太太停住了，车厢里也静悄悄的，连小老虎也乖乖地听着奶奶说话。老太太轻轻叹了口气，指指自己的心继续说：“当母亲的心，为了孩子都要操碎了。听到枪炮声心就往下沉。”这时，小老虎扑了过来，张开双手叫着“奶奶”，要奶奶抱。老太太抚着小老虎的头对郭恩志说：“但愿这孩子长大了不会再听到枪声、炮声。”
    郭恩志看着老太太热爱和平生活的慈祥善良的眼光，看着小老虎无邪天真的微笑，他仿佛感到他面对的不是一个母亲和孩子，而是全中国的母亲和孩子们对他的信赖和期望。他激动地不知道说什么好……
    这时，扩音器里传出：“前方到达天津东站”的播音，志愿军代表们准备下车接受天津各界人民的欢迎。老太太站起来，双手紧握着郭恩志和韩德彩的手说：“孩子们，多多保重你们的身体，上北京见到毛主席，代我这老太婆问他老人家好。你们回前线能见到我儿子，叫他不用替家里操心，多杀敌人，争取和你们一样立功上北京去见毛主席。”郭恩志一把又将小老虎抱起来，再一次紧紧地亲着他那苹果似的小脸，又依依不舍地把他递给老太太说：“老妈妈你放心，我今天见到你就像见到自己的母亲。你的话我句句记着。我们回到朝鲜，一定更好地战斗，保卫你和小老虎，让你们永远听不到枪声和炮声。”韩德彩在旁边加了一句，“也让你们永远听不到炸弹的声音。”老太太激动地连声说道：“多谢，多谢！”小老虎学着奶奶也叫着：“多谢，多谢！”他那清脆的声音一忽儿就被火车到站的汽笛声淹没了。
