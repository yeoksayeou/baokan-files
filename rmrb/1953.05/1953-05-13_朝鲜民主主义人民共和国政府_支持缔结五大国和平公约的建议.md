The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that if the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France conclude a peace pact, it can eliminate international tension and mistrust, and maintain and consolidate the comprehensive peace and security that all good people unanimously desire. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully supports the World People's Peace Congress's proposal to request the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. This proposal fully conforms to the policy of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which seeks peace and friendship with all peoples on an equal footing, respects the national independence and state sovereignty of other countries, and conforms to the will of all Korean people fighting for the freedom and independence of their homeland and world peace.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consistently supported the proposal for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, based on its consistent policy of peace and its belief that countries with different systems can coexist peacefully, and has continuously made sincere efforts to resolve the Korean issue peacefully.

    More than 7,047,000 Korean citizens signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a resolution in March 1950 supporting peace.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is convinced that no disputes or outstanding issues cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual consultation among the countries concerned, and believes that international disputes, especially the Korean issue, must be resolved by peaceful and consultative methods. The Korean people will, together with all peace-loving people around the world, continue to strive to the end against war and in defense of peace.
