Comrades Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers of the Army and Navy!
Comrades Officers, Colonels, and Generals of the Army and Navy!
Working people of the Soviet Union!
Our dear foreign guests!

On behalf of the Soviet Government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I extend my congratulations to you on the International Labor Day, May 1st.

The working people of our motherland are greeting this annual proletarian festival with great achievements in the economic and cultural development of our country. The great Soviet people, more closely united around their own Communist Party and its Central Committee, united around their government, are advancing confidently along the road of communist construction. The armed forces of our country are a reliable guarantee of the peaceful labor of the Soviet people who are carrying out magnificent construction plans.

The fraternal friendship of all nationalities in our multinational country is consolidating year by year, and the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is developing and strengthening in all aspects.

The recent remarks made by Comrades G.M. Malenkov, L.P. Beria, and V.M. Molotov clearly demonstrate the policy of the Soviet government. This policy aims to ensure the fundamental interests of our people and the security of our motherland, to further strengthen the socialist countries, and to maintain world peace.

Acting in accordance with this policy, the government has recently taken a number of important measures aimed at improving state and economic leadership, raising the people's welfare, and guaranteeing the inviolable rights of Soviet citizens.

The reorganization of the central government organs has been implemented, and this measure will improve the leadership of the national economy. An amnesty decree has been promulgated. Measures to further consolidate socialist law are being drafted. Along with the substantial reduction of food prices, the prices of daily-use manufactured goods have also been significantly reduced.

Regarding foreign policy, as can be seen from the official statements of our government, our government believes that, with goodwill and reasonable methods, all international differences can be resolved peacefully. We advocate maintaining and consolidating peace, we fight against the preparation and launching of another war, for international cooperation and the promotion of business relations with all countries. Such a policy of our government is in the interests of all peace-loving people.

The Soviet government will welcome any steps by other countries' governments that are genuinely aimed at easing international tensions, and it is willing to see the leaders of these governments make peace statements that are proven by actions. However, since there is currently no indication that they are reducing armaments or shrinking the network of military bases widely spread across the territories of many countries in Europe and Asia, especially in territories bordering the Soviet Union, our government will continue to pay due attention to ensuring the defense and security of our motherland; our government calls for strengthening our armed forces so that they are prepared and able to crush at any time any hostile forces that attempt to obstruct the Soviet people from peacefully and victoriously advancing towards their great goal—communism. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Soviet Army and Navy personnel to persistently master combat technology and improve their military and political knowledge.

Comrades!

We, the Soviet people, look forward to the future with confidence. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has armed the Party and the people with a clear program for advancing towards a communist society. The measures implemented by our Party and government prove that the government is tirelessly concerned about the welfare of the people, and these measures show that our country's life is being led correctly. Our motherland is strong and vigorous. Let us continue to steadfastly develop and improve our national economy, culture, and science day and night, strengthen our socialist country, and give it greater glory!

Long live May Day, the festival of the unity of the working people of the world, the festival of fraternal friendship of the workers of all countries!
Long live the heroic Soviet people and their heroic Army and Navy!
Long live the Soviet government!
Forward under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, under the leadership of the Communist Party, towards the victory of communism!
Hurrah!

### 布尔加宁阅兵时发表的演说

    布尔加宁阅兵时发表的演说陆海军战士和士官同志们！陆海军尉官、校官和将军同志们！苏联的劳动人民！我们亲爱的外国来宾们！
    我代表苏联政府和苏联共产党中央委员会向你们祝贺五一国际劳动节。
    我们祖国的劳动人民以我国的经济和文化发展方面的巨大成就来迎接这个一年一度的无产阶级节日。伟大的苏联人民更紧密地团结在他们自己的共产党及其中央委员会的周围、团结在他们的政府的周围，满怀信心地沿着共产主义建设的道路前进。我们国家的武装部队是正在执行宏伟的建设计划的苏维埃人民的和平劳动的可靠保障。
    我们多民族国家各民族的兄弟友谊一年比一年巩固，苏联与人民民主国家间的友好合作在各方面都日益发展、日益加强。
    格·马·马林科夫同志，拉·巴·贝利亚同志和维·米·莫洛托夫同志最近发表的言论清楚地说明了苏联政府的政策。这个政策的目的是保障我国人民的根本利益和我们祖国的安全，进一步加强社会主义国家，维护世界和平。
    本着这个政策办事的政府最近采取了许多以改进国家领导和经济领导、提高人民的福利和保障苏维埃公民的不可侵犯的权利为目的的重要措施。
    中央政府机构的改组已经实行了，这个措施将改进国民经济的领导。大赦令颁布了。进一步巩固社会主义法律的措施正在拟订中。与大大减低食品价格的同时，日用的制成品的价格也大大减低了。
    关于外交政策，从我们政府的正式声明中就可以知道，我们政府认为，如果有着善意，并采取合理的办法，一切国际上的分歧都可以以和平方式解决。我们主张维护并巩固和平，我们为反对准备和发动另一次战争、为国际合作并促进与一切国家间的事务关系而斗争。我们政府的这样一个政策是符合一切爱好和平的人民的利益的。
    苏联政府将欢迎其他国家政府的真正以缓和国际紧张局势为目的的任何步骤，它愿意看见这些政府的领袖们发表有行动证实的和平声明。但是，既然目前没有迹象表明它们在裁减军备或收缩广布在欧洲及亚洲许多国家的领土上、特别是与苏联接壤的领土上的军事基地网，我们政府就要继续在保证我们祖国的防御和安全方面给予应有的注意；我们政府号召加强我们的武装部队以便有所准备而能随时粉碎任何敌对势力想要阻挠苏维埃人民向着他们的伟大目标——共产主义和平地和胜利地前进的企图。所以，苏联陆海军人员有责任坚持不懈地掌握战斗技术和提高他们的军事和政治知识。同志们！
    我们，苏维埃人民，满怀信心地瞻望着未来。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会已经以走向共产主义社会的明确纲领武装了党和人民。我们的党和政府实行的措施证明了政府是不倦地关怀着人民的福利的，这些措施表明我国的生活是被正确地领导着的。我们的祖国精强力壮。我们来继续坚忍不拔地日日夜夜地发展和提高我们的国民经济、文化和科学，加强我们的社会主义国家，给它获得更大的光荣罢！
    全世界劳动人民团结的节日、一切国家的工人兄弟友爱的节日——五一节万岁！
    英雄的苏维埃人民和他们英勇的陆海军万岁！
    苏维埃政府万岁！
    在列宁和斯大林的旗帜下、在共产党的领导下前进，走向共产主义的胜利！
    乌拉！
