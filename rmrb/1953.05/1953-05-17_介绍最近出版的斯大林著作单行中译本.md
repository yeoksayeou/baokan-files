The sixteen single-volume Chinese translations of Stalin's works recently published by the People's Publishing House (including the two books, "Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the 14th and 15th Congresses of the CPSU (B)," which will be published before the end of this month), were all published by Comrade Stalin during the era of socialist economic construction in the Soviet Union. In these works, Comrade Stalin summarized the rich experiences gained in the process of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union, and creatively developed Lenin's theory that socialism could be victorious first in one country. From these works, it can be seen how Comrade Stalin established socialist political economics in the irreconcilable struggle against the counter-revolutionary Trotskyites and right-wing opportunists. These works of Comrade Stalin mark the unparalleled vitality of Marxism-Leninism and point out the road to building socialism and moving towards communism.

	Comrade Stalin's works have great significance for the large-scale economic construction currently underway in our country.
	
(I)

	The following are the main contents of these works regarding socialist economic construction.
	
	"Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the 14th Congress of the CPSU (B)" includes Comrade Stalin's report on the work of the Central Committee to the 14th Congress of the CPSU (B) on December 18, 1925, and the conclusion on the discussion of the report on December 23. At that time, after the period of national economic recovery, industrial and agricultural production in the Soviet Union had approached the level before the First World War. However, the Soviet Union was still a backward agricultural country. In this report, Comrade Stalin, based on his profound analysis of the international situation and the domestic situation at that time, pointed out that in order to ensure the economic independence of the Soviet Union, consolidate its national defense capabilities, and create the economic foundation necessary for the victory of socialism, it was necessary to transform the Soviet Union from an agricultural country into an industrial country. Therefore, the essence and foundation of the Party's general line was to transform the Soviet Union from an agricultural country into an industrial country.
	
	"On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policies" is a report given by Comrade Stalin to activists of the Leningrad Party organization on April 13, 1926, regarding the work of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B). This report made programmatic instructions on the policy of socialist industrialization. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the foundation of industry was the establishment of heavy industry, especially the machine manufacturing industry; and pointed out that the method of internal accumulation of funds for socialism was the only way to industrialization. In addition, he also talked about cultivating cadres for industrial construction, enhancing the enthusiasm of the working class, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
	
	"On the Three Basic Slogans of the Party on the Peasant Question" is a letter written by Comrade Stalin in April 1927, clarifying the development of the Party's strategic slogans on the peasant question. Comrade Stalin emphasized that consolidating the alliance of the working class and the working peasants under the leadership of the working class is the guarantee for the successful construction of socialism in the Soviet Union.
	
	"Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the 15th Congress of the CPSU (B)" includes Comrade Stalin's report on the work of the Central Committee to the 15th Congress of the CPSU (B) on December 3, 1927, and the conclusion on the discussion of the report on December 7. At that time, the socialist industrialization of the Soviet Union had achieved decisive achievements, but the agricultural sector, due to the backward, individual small-scale peasant economy, developed very slowly, not only unable to supply the cities with enough marketable grain, but sometimes even simple reproduction was impossible. In this report, in addition to analyzing the international situation at that time and summarizing the achievements of industrialization, Comrade Stalin, based on Lenin's cooperative plan, formulated methods and programs for realizing agricultural collectivization. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the only correct way to get rid of the phenomenon of agriculture lagging behind industry and threatening the entire national economy was to implement the cooperative system of small commodity producers, implement collective farming on a new and higher technical basis, and develop agriculture according to the laws of socialist expanded reproduction. The 15th Congress of the CPSU (B) passed a resolution to vigorously develop agricultural collectivization.
	
	"On the Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the CPSU (B)" is a speech given by Comrade Stalin at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) on November 19, 1928. In this speech, Comrade Stalin mainly raised the issue of the speed of industrialization. He pointed out that only by rapidly developing industry can we catch up with the major capitalist countries economically and technically, have the full industrial base needed for national defense, and accelerate and promote the cause of transforming agriculture on a new technical basis.
	
	"A Year of Great Change" was a year in which the cause of socialist construction in the Soviet Union achieved decisive success on all fronts. Comrade Stalin summarized the achievements of the year in this article. In terms of labor productivity, it demonstrated the creative initiative of the millions of working masses of the working class on the socialist construction front and the expansion of the magnificent labor upsurge; in terms of industry, due to the unfolding of socialist competition, the problem of accumulating funds for heavy industry was basically solved; in terms of agriculture, due to the beginning of comprehensive collectivization, there was also a decisive change, with peasants from entire villages, townships, districts, and even entire states joining collective farms together. This fully demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system. As Comrade Stalin said: "When we put the Soviet Union on a car and the peasants on tractors, please let those noble capitalists who boast of 'civilization' try to catch up with us."
	
	"On Several Issues of Land Policy in the Soviet Union" is a speech given by Comrade Stalin at the Conference of Experts on Marxist Land Issues on December 27, 1929. In this speech, Comrade Stalin refuted the bourgeois, anti-Marxist, right-wing opportunist "equilibrium" theory of "equilibrium" that all parts of the national economy should be "balanced," the "laissez-faire" theory of socialist construction, and the "stable" theory of small-scale peasant economy. At the same time, he also profoundly pointed out that collective farms are essentially a socialist form of economy, and demonstrated the policy of transitioning to comprehensive collectivization and eliminating the rich peasant class on this basis.
	
	"Dizzy with Success" and "Reply to Comrades Working in Collective Farms" are two articles published by Comrade Stalin in March and April 1930 on the collective farm movement. These two articles by Comrade Stalin corrected the various "left" leaning errors that were committed in rural work at that time. Comrade Stalin emphasized the voluntary principle of collective farm construction, that the specific conditions of various regions of the Soviet Union must be taken into account when stipulating the speed and method of collectivization, and that the basic link of the collective farm movement is the agricultural labor cooperative.
	
	"On the Tasks of Economic Workers" is a speech given by Comrade Stalin on February 4, 1931, at the First All-Union Congress of Socialist Industrial Workers. Comrade Stalin pointed out that in order to successfully build socialism, it is required to rapidly transform all departments of the national economy with new and modern technology. And put forward the slogans "Bolsheviks should master technology" and "In the era of transformation, technology determines everything."
	
	"New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction" is a speech given by Comrade Stalin at the Conference of Economic Workers on June 23, 1931. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the conditions for industrial development have undergone fundamental changes, and the new tasks arising therefrom. He proposed: using the method of signing contracts with collective farms to recruit workers in an organized manner, mechanizing production procedures; eliminating the fluidity of labor, eliminating egalitarianism, correctly stipulating wages, and improving the living conditions of workers; eliminating the phenomenon of irresponsibility, improving labor organization, and correctly allocating labor in enterprises; requiring our working class to have its own technical intellectuals of production, changing the attitude towards old engineering and technical talents, paying more attention to and caring for them, and more boldly absorbing them to participate in work; implementing and consolidating the economic accounting system, and improving the internal accumulation of industry.
	
	"Summary of the First Five-Year Plan" is a report given by Comrade Stalin on January 7, 1933, at the Joint Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the CPSU (B). A profound and scientific analysis was made of the tremendous achievements made by the Soviet people in the political, economic, and cultural life of the country during the period of the first five-year plan for economic construction (1928-1932). The basic task of the five-year plan was to transform the Soviet Union from a backward agricultural country into an industrial country, and the recovery and development of heavy industry was the basis for realizing this plan. Due to the successful completion of the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union has changed from an agricultural country to an industrial country. The achievements of industrialization have created the necessary prerequisites for the socialist transformation of agriculture, and have laid the socialist principles in all departments of the national economy. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the achievements of completing the five-year plan are not only of decisive significance for the socialist economic construction of the Soviet Union and the consolidation of the power of the Soviet socialist state, but also of great international significance.
	
	"On Work in the Countryside" and "Speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers" are two speeches given by Comrade Stalin in January and February 1933. In the former speech, Comrade Stalin profoundly analyzed the shortcomings of the Party's work in the countryside at that time, and formulated an entire program for efforts to consolidate the collective farm system. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the new task of the Party in rural work is to find ways to consolidate collective farms, organize labor well in collective farms, turn all collective farms into Bolshevik collective farms, and eliminate all enemies in collective farms. To this end, Comrade Stalin proposed setting up political departments in agricultural machinery stations and Soviet farms to serve as one of the most important tools for eliminating shortcomings in rural work. In the latter speech, Comrade Stalin put forward and demonstrated the following slogans: turn all collective farms into Bolshevik collective farms, and turn all collective farm members into people with abundant lives. This speech greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of thousands of collective farmers.
	
	"Speech at the Graduation Ceremony of the Red Army Academy in the Kremlin" was given by Comrade Stalin on May 4, 1935. He raised the major issue that the Party must solve at that time—the issue of cadres. Comrade Stalin pointed out: "In order to make technology move and use it to the end, there is a need for technical talents, there is a need for cadres who are good at learning to use and skillfully apply this technology."
	
	"Talent, cadres are the most valuable and most decisive capital of all valuable capital in the world."
	
	"Speech at the First All-Union Stakhanovite Workers Conference" was given by Comrade Stalin on November 17, 1935. He pointed out the great historical significance of the Stakhanovite movement and the roots of this movement. The Stakhanovite movement is a new and higher stage of socialist competition, and its purpose is to break the old technical quotas, the old production standards, and the old production plans. Comrade Stalin pointed out that this marks the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working class, and thus opens up the way to eliminate the opposition between manual labor and intellectual labor and move towards communism.
	
(II)

	From the above brief explanations, it can be seen that Comrade Stalin's works are of great significance for our country's economic construction.
	
	The task of economic construction in our country, like the task of the Soviet Union in the early stage of economic construction, is to transform an economically backward country dominated by small-scale agricultural production into an advanced country dominated by modern large-scale industrial production and based on large-scale industry. The route of national industrialization pointed out by Comrade Stalin at the 14th Congress of the CPSU (B) is applicable to us. Because only in this way can we guarantee economic independence and have the ability to consolidate national defense, and create the necessary conditions for a smooth transition to socialism.
	
	Comrade Stalin instructed us: "The center of industrialization, its foundation, is to develop heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and in the final analysis, to develop the production of means of production, and to develop the country's own machine manufacturing industry." ("On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policies," page 5) Developing heavy industry requires a lot of funds. The Soviet Union cannot rely on exploitation and plunder or rely solely on foreign debt to accumulate funds, as capitalist countries do, but must take "the road of self-saving for the development of industry, the road of socialist accumulation" (ibid., page 9). Not only that, "but also be good at rationally and economically using the accumulated reserves, so that not a single penny of the people's property is wasted in vain, so that the accumulation can be used to meet the extremely important needs of our country's industrialization."
	(Ibid., page 14) In order to quickly eliminate the technological backwardness of our country, we must train a large number of technical talents. Comrade Stalin pointed out: In order to build heavy industry, it is necessary to solve the cadre problem, and the task is to "(1) We must absorb thousands of technical talents and experts who support the Soviet regime to participate in the cause of socialist construction; (2) We must train newly emerging red technicians and red experts from the working class." ("A Year of Great Change," page 7)
	
	Comrade Stalin also gave many other valuable instructions on industrialization. For example, the issues of planning, the combination of industry and agriculture, regional distribution, and the Party's leadership over industry are all issues that we need to carefully study and understand.
	
(III)
	
	The agriculture of our country is still dominated by small-scale peasant economy today. The enthusiasm of peasants after the land reform has not only played a great role in the recovery of our country's agriculture, but will also play a great role in the future development of agriculture. However, the agriculture of our country, like that of the Soviet Union, cannot remain on the basis of small-scale peasant economy for a long time. Because it cannot meet the requirements of the continuous growth of agricultural production and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural life. The correct way is to gradually transition to collectivization. As Comrade Stalin pointed out in the Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the 15th Congress of the CPSU (B), it is necessary to "gradually, but consistently, not by coercive methods, but by methods of commendation and persuasion" to realize collective farming. "It is necessary to guide peasants onto the track of collective agriculture according to the principle of voluntariness, and by persuading peasants to believe that public collective agriculture is superior to individual agriculture."
	("Reply to Comrades Working in Collective Farms," page 4) "One of the reasons for the success of our collective farm policy is that this policy is based on the voluntary principle of the collective farm movement and the principle of taking into account the special conditions in various regions of the Soviet Union. It is never permissible to use force to establish collective farms." ("Dizzy with Success," page 3) "The basic link of the collective farm movement, the main form of the collective farm movement, that is, the link that must be grasped at the moment, is the agricultural labor cooperative." (Ibid., page 6) In addition, "a lot of work must be done to transform collective farmers, eliminate their individualistic mentality, and make them true socialist social laborers." ("On Several Issues of Land Policy in the Soviet Union," page 26)
	
	Mutual aid groups working together on the basis of private ownership of means of production, and agricultural production cooperatives characterized by land shares, are still lower forms compared with fully socialist collective farms (i.e., more advanced agricultural production cooperatives). Therefore, it is only a form of transition to socialism in our country's agriculture at present, but this form of transition to socialism is precisely a vital and promising form. Therefore, it is necessary to guide them forward cautiously and actively on the basis of gradual development. Negative attitudes towards agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, not seeing the future, and impetuous emotions of forced command and adventurism are all wrong.
	
	From Comrade Stalin's works, we can further appreciate the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions on "organizing" and the resolution of the CPC Central Committee on mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production. Developing peasant mutual aid and cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit can enable the state to obtain far more marketable grain and industrial raw materials than it does now, and at the same time it can also increase peasant purchasing power, enabling the country's industrial products to obtain a broad market.
	
(IV)
	
	Our country has started this year to carry out the first five-year plan for economic construction. To complete the tasks of the five-year plan, transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, mobilize the strength of millions of people, increase production and practice economy, tap potential forces, and increase labor productivity is an arduous task. Comrade Stalin instructed us: "It would be foolish to think that the production plan is just a table of figures and a list of tasks. In fact, the production plan is the living practical actions of millions of people. The reality of our production plan is the millions of workers who create a new life. The reality of our production plan is living people, it is ourselves, our will to work, our determination to work in new ways, our determination to implement the plan." ("New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction," page 31) Our current task, just as Comrade Stalin instructed, is: "To advance our industry, increase industrial productivity, train new cadres for industrial construction, correctly carry out socialist accumulation, rationally use accumulation for industrial needs, establish an extremely strict system of economy, rectify state organs, streamline and clean up state organs, clean up the bad habits and dirt that state organs have acquired during our construction period, and carry out a constant struggle against theft and waste of state property - all these tasks cannot be solved by any political party without the direct and constant support of millions of workers. Therefore, the task is to attract millions of non-Party workers to participate in the entire construction work of our country." ("On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policies," page 24)
	
	Studying Comrade Stalin's works on the issues of Soviet socialist economic construction is also studying the experience of Soviet socialist economic construction. Chairman Mao pointed out in "The Greatest Friendship": "We Chinese Communists, like Communists in all countries of the world, are seeking the path to our own victory from Comrade Stalin's great works." We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, draw ideological strength from Comrade Stalin's works, and embody it in our various specific tasks, and strive to complete the national economic construction plan.

    介绍最近出版的斯大林著作单行中译本
    中民
    最近人民出版社出版的十六本斯大林著作中译本的单行本（其中在联共（布）第十四次和第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告两书、在本月月底以前出版），都是斯大林同志在苏联社会主义经济建设年代所发表的。斯大林同志在这些著作里，概括了苏联实行社会主义的国家工业化和农业集体化过程中所获得的丰富经验，创造性地发展了列宁关于社会主义可能在一个国家内首先胜利的理论。从这些著作里可以看出，斯大林同志是如何地在与反革命托洛茨基分子和右倾机会主义者进行不调和的斗争中，创立了社会主义政治经济学。斯大林同志的这些著作，标志了马克思列宁主义的无比的生命活力，指明了建成社会主义，并走向共产主义的道路。
    对于我们国家今天正在进行的大规模经济建设说来，斯大林同志的这些著作，有着巨大的意义。
    （一）
    这些著作中关于社会主义经济建设方面的有以下的主要内容。
    “在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”，包括斯大林同志一九二五年十二月十八日在联共第十四次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告，和十二月二十三日关于大会对总结报告讨论经过的结论。当时苏联经过国民经济恢复时期，工业生产和农业生产已经接近了第一次世界大战以前的水平。但是，苏联还是一个落后的农业的国家。斯大林同志在这个报告里，根据他对当时国际形势和国内情况的深刻分析，指出：为了保证苏联在经济上的独立，并巩固它的国防能力，为了造成社会主义胜利所必需的经济基础，就必须把苏联由农业国变成工业国。因此，党的总路线的实质和基础，就是把苏联由农业国变成为工业国。
    “论苏联经济状况和党底政策”，是斯大林同志一九二六年四月十三日给列宁格勒党组织积极分子作的关于联共（布）中央全会工作的报告。这个报告对社会主义工业化的方针作了纲领性的指示。斯大林同志指出，工业的基础是建立重工业，特别是机器制造业；并指出社会主义的内部积累资金的方法，是工业化的唯一道路。此外，他也讲到了造就工业建设干部，提高工人阶级积极性，巩固工农联盟等问题。
    “论党在农民问题上的三个基本口号”是斯大林同志一九二七年四月所写的一封信，阐明了党在农民问题上战略口号的发展。斯大林同志着重地指出，巩固工人阶级领导下的工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟，乃是苏联建设社会主义成功的保证。
    “在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”，包括斯大林同志一九二七年十二月三日在联共第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告，和十二月七日关于大会对总结报告讨论经过的结论。当时，苏联的社会主义工业化已获得了有决定意义的成就，但是农业方面由于是落后的、个体的小农经济，发展速度非常缓慢，不但不能供应城市以足够的商品粮食，有时甚至连简单再生产也不可能实现。斯大林同志在这个报告中，除分析了当时的国际形势，总结了工业化的成就外，并根据列宁的合作社计划，制定了实现农业集体化的办法和纲领。斯大林同志指出，摆脱农业落后于工业的这种威胁全部国民经济的现象，唯一正确的道路就是实行小商品生产者的合作制，在用新的更高的技术基础上实行集体耕种制，使农业按社会主义的扩大再生产的法则来发展。联共第十五次代表大会通过了大力开展农业集体化的决议。
    “论国家工业化与联共（布）党内的右倾”是斯大林同志一九二八年十一月十九日在联共（布）中央全会上的演说。在这一演说中，斯大林同志主要提出了工业化速度问题。指出只有迅速发展工业，才能在经济上和技术上赶上主要资本主义国家，才能有国防所需要的充分的工业基础，也才能在新的技术基础上加速和推进改造农业的事业。
    “大转变的一年”，是苏联社会主义建设事业在各条战线上都获得有决定意义的成功的一年。斯大林同志在这篇论文里总结了一年的成绩。在劳动生产率方面，表现了工人阶级的千百万劳动群众在社会主义建设战线上创造发起作用和雄伟劳动热潮的扩展；在工业方面，由于展开了社会主义竞赛，基本上解决了为重工业积累资金的问题；在农业方面，由于全面集体化的开始，也有了决定性的转变，有的是整村、整乡、整区以至整州的农民一起加入集体农庄了。这充分表现了社会主义制度的优越。正如斯大林同志所说：“当我们把苏联架在汽车上而把农民架在拖拉机上的时候，就请那些以‘文明’自夸的高贵资本家们来试试追上我们吧。”
   “论苏联土地政策底几个问题”，是斯大林同志一九二九年十二月二十七日在马克思主义土地问题专家代表会议上的演说。斯大林同志在这一演说中，驳斥了资产阶级的，反马克思主义的，右倾机会主义的所谓国民经济各部分彼此应该“平衡”的“平衡”论，社会主义建设事业“自流”论，小农经济“稳固”论。同时，他还深刻地指出了集体农庄按本质说是社会主义的经济形式，论证了过渡到全面集体化和在这个基础上消灭富农阶级的政策。
    “胜利冲昏头脑”和“给集体农庄工作同志们的答复”，是斯大林同志一九三○年三月和四月间发表的两篇关于集体农庄运动的论文。斯大林同志的这两篇论文，纠正了当时在农村工作中所犯各种 “左”倾的错误。斯大林同志强调指出了集体农庄建设的自愿原则，在规定集体化速度和方法时必须估计到苏联各区的特殊条件，集体农庄运动的基本环节是农业劳动组合等问题。
     “论经济工作人员底任务”，是斯大林同志一九三一年二月四日在第一次全苏联社会主义工业工作人员代表会议上的演说。斯大林同志指出，为了顺利地建设社会主义，要求迅速地以新的现代的技术改造国民经济的一切部门。并提出“布尔什维克应当掌握技术”和“在改造时期，技术决定一切”的口号。
    “新的环境和新的经济建设任务”，是斯大林同志一九三一年六月二十三日在经济工作人员会议上的演说。斯大林同志指出了工业发展条件起了根本的变化，及由此而产生的新任务。提出：用与集体农庄订立合同的办法来有组织地招收工人，把生产手续机械化；消灭劳动力的流动性，消灭平均主义，正确规定工资，改善工人生活条件；消灭无人负责现象，改善劳动组织，在企业里正确配备劳动力；要我国工人阶级有自己的生产技术知识分子，要改变对旧工程技术人材的态度，多多关注和关照他们，更大胆地吸收他们参加工作；实行并巩固经济核算制，提高工业内部的积累。
     “第一个五年计划底总结”，是斯大林同志一九三三年一月七日在联共（布）中央委员会和中央监察委员会联席全会上的报告。对苏联人民在第一个经济建设的五年计划期间（一九二八年至一九三二年）在国内政治、经济和文化生活方面所获得的巨大成就，作了深刻的科学的分析。五年计划的基本任务，就是把苏联由一个落后的农业国变为工业国，恢复和发展重工业是实现这一计划的基础。由于顺利地完成第一个五年计划，苏联已由农业国变成了工业国。工业化的成就，给农业的社会主义改造创造了必要的前提，在国民经济各部门中都奠定了社会主义原则。斯大林同志指出，完成五年计划的成就不仅对于苏联的社会主义经济建设和巩固苏维埃社会主义国家的威力具有决定性的意义，它也具有巨大的国际意义。
    “论农村中的工作”和“在第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上的演说”，是斯大林同志在一九三三年一月和二月间发表的两篇演说。在前一演说中，斯大林同志深刻地分析了当时党在农村工作中的缺点，并拟定了努力巩固集体农庄制度的整个纲领。斯大林同志指出，党在农村工作方面新的任务，就是必须设法巩固集体农庄，在集体农庄中好好组织劳动，把一切集体农庄变成布尔什维克的集体农庄，肃清集体农庄中的一切敌人。为此，斯大林同志提议在农业机器站与苏维埃农庄中设立政治部，以用来作为消灭农村工作中缺点的最重要的工具之一。在后一演说中，斯大林同志提出并论证了如下的口号：把所有的集体农庄变成布尔什维克的集体农庄，把所有的集体农庄庄员变成生活丰裕的人。这篇演说大大地鼓舞了千千万万集体农民的劳动热情。
    “在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说”，是斯大林同志在一九三五年五月四日发表的。提出了党在当时必须解决的重大问题—干部问题。斯大林同志指出：“为要使技术动作起来并把它利用到底，就需要有精通技术的人材，就需要有善于学会利用和巧于运用这种技术的干部。”
    “人材，干部是世界上所有一切宝贵资本中最宝贵最有决定意义的资本。”
    “在第一次全苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者会议上的演说”是斯大林同志在一九三五年十一月十七日发表的。他指出了斯达汉诺夫运动的伟大历史意义和这一运动的根源。斯达汉诺夫运动是社会主义竞赛的新的更高的阶段，它的目的就是要求打破旧的技术定额，旧的生产标准和旧的生产计划。斯大林同志指出，这就标志着工人阶级文化水平和技术水平的提高，因而也就开辟了消灭体力劳动和智力劳动的对立，走向共产主义的道路。
        （二）
    从以上这些简短的说明中，可以看出斯大林同志的这些著作，对于我国的经济建设具有非常重要的意义。
    我们国家经济建设的任务，和苏联在经济建设初期的任务一样，也是要把经济落后的、以小农生产为主的国家，变成为以近代大工业生产为主的、建立在大工业基础上的先进国家。斯大林同志在联共第十四次代表大会上所指出的国家工业化的路线，对于我们是适用的。因为只有这样，我们才能保证在经济上独立和有巩固国防的能力，给顺利过渡到社会主义造成必需的条件。
    斯大林同志指示我们：“工业化的中心、它的基础，就是发展重工业（燃料、五金等等），归根到底，就是发展生产资料底生产，发展本国的机器制造业。”（“论苏联经济状况和党底政策”，第五页）发展重工业需要大量资金，苏联不能像资本主义国家那样，靠剥削和掠夺或专靠借外债来积累资金，而是要走“为发展工业而自行节约的道路，社会主义积累底道路”（同上，第九页）。不仅如此，“还要善于合理地、节省地使用积累起来的后备，使人民财产一个钱也不白白浪费，使积累能用于满足我国工业化的极重要的需要这一基本方面。”
    （同上，第十四页）为要迅速消灭我国技术上的落后现象，必须培养大批的技术人材。斯大林同志指出：为了建成重工业，必须解决干部问题，任务就在于“（一）我们要吸收成千成万拥护苏维埃政权的技术人材和专门家来参加社会主义建设事业；（二）我们要从工人阶级中间培养新起的红色技师和红色专门家。”（“大转变的一年”，第七页）
    斯大林同志对工业化还有其他许多宝贵的指示。比如对于计划问题，工业和农业相结合的问题，地区分布问题，党对工业领导问题等，都是需要我们悉心研究领会的。
    （三）
    我们国家的农业在今天还是小农经济占优势的。农民在土地改革以后的积极性，不但对于我国农业的恢复起了很大的作用，对于今后农业的发展也要起很大作用。但是，我国的农业和苏联同样，是不能长期停留在小农经济基础上的。因为它不能满足农业生产的不断增长和人民物质文化生活不断提高的要求。正确的道路，就是逐渐过渡到集体化。正如斯大林同志在联共第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告中指出的，必须“循序渐进，然而一贯到底地，不是用强迫方法，而是用表彰和说服方法”，来实现集体耕种制。“必须按照自愿原则，用说服农民相信公共集体农业优越于个体农业的方法来引导农民走上集体农业的轨道。”
    （“给集体农庄工作同志们的答复”，第四页）“我们集体农庄政策所以获得成功的原因之一，就在这个政策是依据于集体农庄运动自愿原则和估计到苏联各个不同区域内特殊条件的原则。决不可用强力来设立集体农庄。”（“胜利冲昏头脑”，第三页）“集体农庄运动底基本环节，集体农庄运动底主要形式，即现时必须努力抓住的一环，就是农业劳动组合。”（同上，第六页）此外，“还要作很多工作来改造集体农民，消除他们的个人主义心理，使他们成为真正的社会主义社会劳动者。”（“论苏联土地政策底几个问题”，第二六页）
    在生产资料私有的基础上共同劳动的互助组，和以土地入股为特点的农业生产合作社，比起完全的社会主义的集体农庄（即更高级的农业生产合作社），还是较低级的形式，因此，它还只是目前我国农业向社会主义过渡的形式，可是这种向社会主义的过渡的形式，又正是富有生命的有前途的形式。所以要谨慎地又积极地在逐步发展的基础上，引导它们前进。对待农业互助合作消极的态度，看不见前途，以及强迫命令冒进主义的急躁情绪都是错误的。
    从斯大林同志的著作中，我们可以进一步地体会到毛主席关于“组织起来”的指示和中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议的精神。按照自愿和互利的原则发展农民互助合作，就可以使国家得到比现在多得多的商品粮食和工业原料，同时也可以提高农民购买力，使国家的工业品得到广大销场。

    我们的国家已从今年开始，进行第一个经济建设的五年计划。要完成五年计划的任务，把中国由一个农业国变为工业国，动员千百万群众的力量，增产节约，挖掘潜在力量，提高劳动生产率，是一件非常艰巨的工作。斯大林同志指示我们：“如果以为生产计划就是一张数字表和工作任务一览表，那就是愚蠢的想法了。其实，生产计划是千百万人底活的实际行动。我们的生产计划底实在性，就是创造新生活的千百万劳动者。我们的生产计划底实在性，就是活的人，就是我们自己，我们的劳动意志，我们按新方法来工作的决心，我们执行计划的决心。”（“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”，第三一页）我们当前的任务，也正如斯大林同志所指示的：“向前推进我国工业，提高工业生产率，造就新的工业建设干部，正确进行社会主义积累，把积累合理地使用于工业需要，建立极严格的节约制度，整顿国家机关，使国家机关精简廉洁，清洗国家机关在我国建设时期所沾染的恶习和污秽，与盗窃和浪费国家财产的现象进行不断的斗争——所有这些任务，如果没有工人阶级千百万群众直接和经常的支持，任何政党都是不能够解决的。因此，任务就在于吸引千百万非党工人群众来参加我国的全部建设工作。”（“论苏联经济状况和党底政策”，第二四页）
    学习斯大林同志关于苏联社会主义经济建设问题的著作，也就是学习苏联社会主义经济建设的经验。毛主席在“最伟大的友谊”中指出：“我们中国共产党人和世界各国共产党人一样，是从斯大林同志的伟大的著作中去找寻自己胜利的途径的。”我们要遵照毛主席的这个指示，从斯大林同志的著作中，吸取思想力量，并把它体现在我们的各个具体工作中，为完成国家经济建设的计划而努力。
