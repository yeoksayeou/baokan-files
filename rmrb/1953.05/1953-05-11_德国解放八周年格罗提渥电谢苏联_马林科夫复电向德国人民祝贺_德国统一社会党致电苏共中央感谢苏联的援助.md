Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 9th: On the eve of the eighth anniversary of Germany's liberation, Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of the Republic's government, sent a telegram to G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, expressing heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to the Soviet government.

The telegram stated: "As the German people commemorate this day of liberation from Hitler fascism, they hold in esteem and deep gratitude the brave Soviet heroes who, under the outstanding leadership of the immortal Marshal Stalin, liberated the German people and opened up a path for them towards a bright future."

The telegram stated: "The working people of the German Democratic Republic have begun to build socialism with great enthusiasm. The inestimable and comprehensive support given to us by the Soviet Union in carrying out this work inspires the working people of the German Democratic Republic to strive for ever greater achievements."

The telegram continued: "Following the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are steadfastly advancing on this path and are fighting together with the patriots of West Germany against the Bonn military treaty, for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and for the establishment of a democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany."

The telegram pointed out: "The Soviet Union has consistently supported the German people in this struggle and has consistently advocated a peaceful solution to the German question. Recently, the Soviet government once again stated very clearly that all unresolved international issues can be resolved peacefully. In doing so, it has made a great contribution to easing international tensions and to peace."

Grotewohl's telegram concluded: "Dearest Comrade Malenkov, I assure you that the working people of the German Democratic Republic, who are closely linked to the great standard-bearer of peace, the Soviet Union, and the people's democracies, will continue to fulfill their due responsibility for the cause of safeguarding peace and will do their utmost to fight for the unification of their motherland."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 9th: The following is G.M. Malenkov's reply telegram to Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic:

"Comrade Prime Minister, please accept my thanks for your friendly telegram on the eighth anniversary of the liberation of the German people from fascist enslavement, addressed to the government of the German Democratic Republic and to you personally.

I wish the German people victory in their struggle for national unity, for the establishment of a peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany, and for the early conclusion of a peace treaty that is in the interests of the German people and all peace-loving countries."

(Signed) G.M. Malenkov

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 9th: On the eve of the eighth anniversary of Germany's liberation, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, on behalf of all its members and the German working people, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, expressing deep gratitude for the Soviet Union's historic action in liberating Germany and for the generous and selfless assistance given to the German Democratic Republic in the process of building socialist foundations.

The telegram from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany stated: "The world-historical victory won by the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War made it possible for the German people to embark on a new path leading to the establishment of a peace-loving, democratic Germany. The German Democratic Republic has become the foundation for building a unified, democratic Germany and has won the fraternal sympathy of all peace-loving peoples. The German people are particularly grateful for the Soviet Union's initiative and willingness to resolve the German question peacefully through the conclusion of a just peace treaty with Germany."

The telegram stated: "The working people of the German Democratic Republic have received effective assistance from the socialist Soviet Union and its party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in all aspects of German social life. As a result, the German working class has been able to develop their state-owned industry in a short period of time. The peasants of democratic Germany are organizing agricultural production cooperatives. Production in many industrial sectors has greatly exceeded pre-war production levels."

The telegram pointed out: "The Socialist Unity Party of Germany, drawing on the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is gradually developing into a Marxist-Leninist party. The immortal Stalin's teachings and the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union guide the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in its advance in the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic."

The telegram concluded: "The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is doing its utmost to prevent the implementation of the Bonn and Paris war treaties. It will strengthen the combat readiness and combat effectiveness of German patriots in order to defend the democratic achievements of the German people. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany will continue to fight for the unification of Germany until a free, independent, and peace-loving democratic Germany is established."

    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：在德国解放八周年纪念日的前夕，德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥代表共和国政府致电苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫，向苏联政府表示衷心的祝贺和感谢。
    电报说：德国人民在纪念这个从希特勒法西斯主义下获得解放的日子的时候，对于在不朽的斯大林大元帅的卓越领导下解放德国人民并给他们开辟了一个走向光明前途的道路的勇敢的苏联英雄们，怀着敬爱和深挚的感谢。
    电报说：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民已经开始以巨大的热情建设社会主义。在进行这个工作中苏联给予我们的无法估计的全面的支持，鼓舞着德意志民主共和国的劳动人民争取日益巨大的成就。
    德意志民主共和国劳动人民遵循着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的教导，正在坚定不移地在这条道路上前进，并且正在和西德的爱国分子共同为反对波恩军事条约、争取缔结对德和约和争取建立一个民主、爱好和平与独立的德国而战斗。
    电报指出：苏联不断支持德国人民进行这个斗争并一贯主张和平解决德国问题。最近，苏联政府再度十分明确地指出：一切争执不下的国际问题都能用和平方式解决。这样，它就对消除国际紧张局势、对和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    格罗提渥的电报最后说：最敬爱的马林科夫同志，我向您保证：和伟大的和平旗手苏联与人民民主国家有着亲密联系的德意志民主共和国劳动人民，将继续对维护和平的事业尽他们应尽的责任，并将尽最大努力为他们祖国的统一进行斗争。
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：格·马·马林科夫给德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的复电如下：
    总理同志，收到您在德国人民从法西斯的奴役中解放出来的八周年的时候给我的友好的来电，请接受我对德意志民主共和国政府和您个人表示的谢意。
    我祝德国人民在他们为全国统一，为建立一个爱好和平、民主、独立的德国，为及早缔结符合于德国人民与所有爱好和平国家的利益的和约的斗争中获得胜利。
    格·马·马林科夫（签字）
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会代表全体党员和德国劳动人民，在德国解放八周年纪念日前夕致电苏联共产党中央委员会，对苏联解放德国的历史性行动和对德意志民主共和国在建设社会主义基础的过程中所给予的慷慨无私的援助，表示深厚的谢意。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会的电报说：苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争中赢得的具有世界历史意义的胜利，使得德国人民有可能走上导致建立爱好和平的民主德国的新道路。德意志民主共和国已经成为建立一个统一的、民主的德国的基础，而且已经博得一切爱好和平的人民的兄弟般的同情。德国人民特别感激苏联倡议并且准备通过一个公正的对德和约的缔结用和平方法来解决德国问题。
    电报说：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民得到了社会主义的苏联和它的党——苏联共产党——在德国社会生活各方面所给予的有效援助。德国工人阶级因而能够在短期内发展他们的国营工业。民主德国的农民们正在组织农业生产合作社。许多工业生产部门中的生产量都大大超过了战前的生产水平。
    电报指出：德国统一社会党汲取苏联共产党的丰富经验，正在逐渐发展为一个马克思—列宁主义的政党。不朽的斯大林的学说和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议，指导着德国统一社会党在德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设中向前迈进。
    电报最后说：德国统一社会党正在尽力阻止波恩和巴黎战争条约的实现。它将加强德国爱国人士的战斗准备和战斗效能，以便保卫德国人民的民主成就。德国统一社会党将继续为德国的统一而斗争，直到建立一个自由、独立和爱好和平的民主德国。
