Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The "Pravda" correspondent in Vienna, Mikhailov, wrote a commentary on the 14th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce recently held in Vienna. He pointed out that the conference showed that Western European business circles have come out against restricting international trade. Representatives of U.S. monopoly capitalists tried to convince their Western European partners that they themselves were the source of all evil, and therefore, as long as they removed Europe's own tariff barriers, trade would immediately become active. However, Western European business representatives held the opposite view. The representatives of U.S. monopoly capitalists had probably never heard so many complaints before.

	British representatives spoke most sharply. They directly accused their American "colleagues" of being the source of all evil. British representative, Cambridge University professor Dennis Robertson, bluntly stated that the United States should fundamentally change its foreign trade policy. He pointed out that if the status quo were maintained, countries in the Sterling Area would be forced to more strictly restrict the import of dollar goods in order to preserve their gold and dollar reserves.

	Western European business representatives pointed out that the United States, on the one hand, tried its best to make its Western European partners perpetually debtors, and on the other hand, took measures to expand its exports, while it itself built high tariff barriers, making it impossible for goods from other countries in the world to enter the United States. A Danish representative said: This evil must be eradicated. Serious efforts must be made to force American manufacturers to pay attention to imports, and at the same time reduce American exports to European countries. To achieve this goal, the United States must change its tariff and foreign trade policies.

	The representatives of U.S. monopoly capitalists found themselves in a disadvantageous position at the meeting. They stated that the United States did not intend to compromise. They demanded that their Western European "friends" abandon their sovereignty and achieve "European unification." However, this plan to establish a European common market was met with very strong opposition. Representatives of Western European countries frankly pointed out that this so-called "unification" was not in line with the economic interests of these countries. The chairman of the French National Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce said: "It is impossible to unify Europe." Hans Boden, a representative of West German business circles, admitted: "In Europe, no one would agree to give up their national language, or to give up national institutions with hundreds of years of history."

	It was particularly felt at the conference that Western European business people were striving to re-establish trade relations with the East. The "New York Post" admitted that America's Western "friends" were desperately looking for sales markets for their goods. Enterprises in Western European countries are doing their best to get rid of the restrictions imposed on them by the United States.

	Mikhailov concluded by writing that the conference also showed that some business people in capitalist countries are increasingly determined to transform war economy into a peace economy. At the closing of the conference, Getz, who was elected chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce, said: Although the economies of the member countries of the International Chamber of Commerce are far from fully recovered, they are still shrouded in the shadow of expanding armaments plans, and expanding armaments plans are a heavy burden on national finances and business people. People have the right to demand a change in this situation. We must make unremitting efforts to draw everyone's attention to the fact that only a gradual restoration of normal peaceful relations can expand and invigorate markets.

### 西欧工商界激烈反对美国限制国际贸易

    西欧工商界激烈反对美国限制国际贸易
    据新华社讯：“真理报”驻维也纳记者米哈伊洛夫撰文评论最近在维也纳举行的国际商会第十四届代表大会。他指出，大会表明，西欧的工商界人士已出来反对限制国际贸易。美国垄断资本家的代表们希图叫他们西欧的伙伴们相信，他们本身就是一切罪恶的来源，因此，只要他们取消欧洲本身的关税壁垒，贸易便会马上活跃起来。但是，西欧工商界代表抱着一种相反的看法。美国垄断资本家的代表们大概以前从来没有听到过这么多的怨言。
    英国代表说的话最尖锐。他们直接指责他们的美国“同僚们”是一切罪恶的来源。英国代表、剑桥大学教授丹尼斯·罗伯逊直言不讳地说，美国应该根本改变它的对外贸易政策。他指出，如果维持现状的话，英镑集团国家势将被迫更加严格地限制美元货物进口，以保存它们的黄金美元储备。
    西欧工商界代表们指出，美国一方面极力使它的西欧伙伴们陷于永远是债务人的地位，另一方面则采取措施扩大它的出口，同时它自己高筑关税壁垒，使世界其他国家的货物无法输入美国。丹麦代表说：必须根除这种罪恶。必须以认真的努力来迫使美国制造商们重视进口，并同时减少美国对欧洲各国的输出。为了达到这个目的，美国必须改变它的关税与对外贸易政策。
    美国垄断资本家的代表发现他们自己在会上处于一种不利的地位。他们表示，美国是不打算让步的。他们要求西欧“朋友们”放弃主权，使“欧洲统一。”但是，这种建立欧洲共同市场的计划遭到非常强烈的反对。西欧国家代表坦率地指出，这种所谓“统一”是不符合这些国家的经济利益的。国际商会法国全国委员会主席说：“统一欧洲是不可能的。”西德商界人士代表汉斯·鲍登承认：“在欧洲，没有任何人会同意放弃他们的民族语言，会同意放弃有几百年历史的国家机构。”
    从大会中特别可以感觉到，西欧商业界人士正在努力争取重新建立与东方的贸易关系。“纽约邮报”承认，美国的西方“朋友们”正在拚命地寻找他们货物的销售市场。西欧各国企业界极力要摆脱美国强加在他们身上的限制。
    米哈伊洛夫最后写道，大会还表明，资本主义国家中的某些工商界人士愈来愈坚决地表示要把战争经济转变为和平经济。在大会闭幕时当选为国际商会主席的盖特说：虽然国际商会各会员国的经济还远没有完全恢复过来，但是，它们仍然为扩张军备计划的阴影所笼罩着，扩张军备计划是国家财政及工商业者的沉重负担。人们有权利要求改变这种情况。我们必须努力不懈地提请大家注意一个事实，就是：只有逐步恢复正常的和平关系才有可能扩大市场并使市场活跃。
