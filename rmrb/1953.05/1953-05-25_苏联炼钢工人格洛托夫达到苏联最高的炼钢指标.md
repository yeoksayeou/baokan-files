Xinhua News Agency, Stalinno, 24th. TASS reports from Stalinno (in the Donbas), USSR: Ivan Glotov, a young steelworker at the "Kirov Factory" in Makeyevka, Stalinno Oblast (in the Donbas), USSR, has recently achieved the highest production target in the Soviet Union for three consecutive months. He reduced the steelmaking time per furnace by one-third, and increased the steel output per square meter of furnace bottom area by more than five tons. Glotov's achievement is remarkable. He has only been a steelworker for a year, but due to the numerous opportunities within the factory to improve his professional skills and his own efforts, he quickly mastered his profession and achieved such great success. The Steelworkers' Union Committee of Stalinno Oblast has decided to award him the honorary title of "Excellent Steelworker of Stalinno Oblast."

    苏联炼钢工人格洛托夫达到苏联最高的炼钢指标
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社斯大林诺讯：苏联斯大林诺州（在顿巴斯）马基耶夫卡“基洛夫工厂”的青年炼钢工人伊凡·格洛托夫，最近三个月中达到了苏联最高的生产指标。他把炼一炉钢的时间缩短了三分之一，每一平方公尺炉底面积的出钢量增加了五吨多。格洛托夫的成绩是很突出的。他当炼钢工人只不过一年，但是，由于厂内有着提高业务水平的许多便利条件和自己的努力，他很快就完全掌握了自己的业务，获得了这样巨大的成就。斯大林诺州钢铁工人工会委员会已决定授给他以“斯大林诺州优秀炼钢工人”的光荣称号。
