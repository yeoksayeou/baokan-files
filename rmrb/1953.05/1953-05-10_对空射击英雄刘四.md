    Anti-Aircraft Shooting Hero Liu Si
        Li Bai
    On the day when the people of the capital celebrated "May Day," the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's delegation to the National Day celebrations stood on the reviewing stand in front of Tiananmen Square. Among them was a tall hero with a dark red face, his chest covered with medals and awards, as well as a "Second Class Soldier of Freedom Medal" awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This was Comrade Liu Si, the deputy platoon leader of the Third Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, a first-class meritorious person and second-class anti-aircraft shooting hero who shot down twelve enemy planes and wounded sixteen. He had just attended a hero's conference in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and was invited by the people of the motherland to participate in the "May Day" National Day celebrations.
    Comrade Liu Si's heroic deeds are astonishing:
    The ×× bridge was an important location on the supply line of our army on the western front of Korea. Every day, countless vehicles carrying ammunition, food, gifts from the motherland, and enthusiastic letters of condolences sped across these two wooden bridges. Enemy planes also constantly attacked here.
    In June 1952, the Third Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company was ordered to guard this important point on the transportation line—the ×× bridge.
    The valley here was narrow, which was very unfavorable for the artillery to build positions. They had to build their positions on the steep slopes and camouflage them to monitor the American air pirates.
    Sure enough, on the third day, four enemy planes attacked from behind the mountains. On the position, the anti-aircraft artillery immediately launched a fierce bombardment. The enemy planes dove towards the position in single file. After the first plane strafed for a while, the second plane followed closely and dropped six gasoline bombs. Soon, flames engulfed the position, the camouflage on the artillery was burned off, and five or six comrades were burned. Liu Si was also injured in the face and right eye, and his right eye was so swollen that he could not see clearly. The position was in flames, and the enemy planes became even more rampant. At this time, Liu Si grabbed the steering wheel with both hands, stared at the narrow valley with his left eye, and when the enemy plane circled around the mountain and swooped down, he fired a series of shells at the enemy plane. With a flash of white light, the enemy plane emitted a thick smoke and crashed down obliquely. The remaining enemy planes, seeing that the situation was not good, fled in a hurry.
    The gunners were cleaning up the position, and the instructor advised Liu Si to go down to recuperate, but Liu Si smiled and said, "It's okay to burn a few eyebrows." He quickly wrapped up his wounds and wiped the artillery again.
    Having suffered, the enemy planes, although they still came to bomb, did not dare to fly low for two full months.
    One day two months later, at noon, suddenly more than fifty enemy planes came to bomb the villages and bridges in this area, as well as the positions.
    Liu Si watched as the thatched houses in the village caught fire, and saw eight enemy planes attacking near the position. The enthusiasm for protecting the people and the bridge burned in his heart; he adjusted the direction, and before the enemy plane could drop its bombs, he fired a series of artillery fire head-on. The first enemy plane fell down emitting black smoke. At this moment, another enemy plane swooped down, and Liu Si suffered a serious injury to his right forehead, blood flowing from the corner of his eye to his face and onto the steering wheel he was holding tightly; he fell down. The squad leader ran over and helped him, saying, "Go down quickly!" Liu Si wiped the blood off his face, looked at the squad leader, and said anxiously, "Quickly shoot down the plane, I am a Communist Party member, I will fight it to the end as long as I have a breath left!" He climbed up and reached for the steering wheel with both hands... but he was bleeding too much, and he fainted on the artillery as soon as he grabbed the steering wheel.
    The gunners continued to fire. The enemy planes also strafed desperately.
    In the sound of explosions, Liu Si woke up. He crawled a few steps, leaned against the artillery, picked up his rifle, and fired at the plane continuously. The comrades on the position shouted loudly, "Learn from Comrade Liu Si, a Communist Party member!"
    In the smoke-filled position, the anti-aircraft artillery fire became more and more fierce in striking the enemy planes. In the face of these steel warriors, the enemy flinched and finally fled.
    Liu Si bandaged his wound, lit a cigarette, and several comrades gathered around him and asked him cordially, "How are you? Why don't you go down and recuperate?" Liu Si smiled and said, "This cigarette from the motherland really refreshes and relieves sleepiness; this artillery sent by the motherland is really effective, it shoots accurately and steadily." He looked at his comrades, put out the cigarette and put it in his pocket, and then said, "Let's go and see the artillery first."
    The soldiers were building the position, wiping the artillery, and carrying ammunition. More than ten minutes later, the position was completely back to normal, and they continued to be vigilant in preparing to strike the enemy.
    Just then, the sound of enemy planes came from afar again. The gunners quickly stood in position. On Liu Si's artillery, the work of the first gunner had been taken over by the soldier Wu Yusheng. Liu Si walked over very caringly, sat next to the first gunner, and said kindly, "Xiao Wu, listen to me, if I tell you to aim to the left, you aim to the left, if I tell you to aim to the right, you aim to the right, our artillery has never lost a battle."
    The position was still quiet. The enemy planes flew closer and closer, and when they came over the position, they boldly rushed over. "Ready, fire!" Liu Si stared at the enemy plane with his left eye.
    An enemy plane was just about to drop its bombs on the position when it was hit by Liu Si's artillery and the artillery fire of the first squad, along with the plane itself. This enemy plane did not have time to drop its bombs and exploded in the sky. The pilot fell straight to his death on the artillery position. A six-round pistol and a parachute became the spoils of the gunners.
    The ×× bridge was still open day and night, and the enemy planes still came often, but they flew higher and dropped their bombs far away, daring not to be so presumptuous on the anti-aircraft artillery positions.
    The Third Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company has been vigilantly carrying out the task of guarding the ×× bridge. Liu Si has never left his comrades, never left his artillery, and never left the position that he bled to protect and consolidate.
    In their company, in addition to the heroes' chests constantly adding medals and awards, there was also a silk banner with the ten characters "Defeat the enemy planes and ensure safe transportation." This silk banner was jointly presented to them by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Engineering Corps, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people. (Attached image)

    对空射击英雄刘四
  　黎白
    首都人民欢庆“五一”节那天，在天安门前的观礼台上，站着志愿军归国观礼代表团的英雄们。其中有一个脸色黑红、个子高高的英雄，胸前挂满了勋章和奖章，还有一枚朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所奖给的“二级战士自由勋章”。这就是志愿军某部高射炮第三连的副排长，击落敌机十二架、击伤敌机十六架的一等功臣、二级对空射击英雄刘四同志。他是刚在志愿军某部开过英雄大会，就被祖国人民邀请回来参加“五一”节观礼的。
    刘四同志的英雄事迹是惊人的：
    ××桥是朝鲜西线我军供应线上的要地，每天都有无数汽车载着弹药、粮食、祖国的慰劳品和热情的慰问信，从这两座木桥上飞驰而过。敌人的飞机也不断地向这里袭击。
    一九五二年六月，高射炮第三连奉命驻守这个运输线上的要地——××桥。
    这里山谷狭窄，对炮兵构筑阵地很不利，他们只好把阵地构筑在陡斜的山坡上，伪装起来，监视着美国空中强盗。
    果然，到了第三天，四架敌机从山后偷袭过来。阵地上，高射炮火立刻展开猛烈的轰击。敌机鱼贯地向阵地扑来，第一架扫射了一阵以后，第二架紧跟着投下了六颗汽油弹。不一会儿，火焰包围了阵地，炮上的伪装被烧掉了，五、六个同志被烧伤了，刘四脸上、右眼也负了伤，右眼肿得都看不清了。阵地上一片大火，敌机更加猖狂起来。这时，刘四双手抓着方向盘，左眼凝视着狭窄的山谷，等那架敌机从山边绕过来，往下俯冲的时候，就朝着敌机猛烈地射出一排炮弹，白光闪处，敌机冒出了一道浓烟，倾斜地坠了下去。其余的敌机见势不妙，慌忙逃走了。
    炮手们收拾着阵地，指导员劝刘四下去休养，刘四却笑着说：“燎了几根眉毛，不要紧。”他迅速地裹好了伤口，就又擦起炮来。
    敌机吃了苦头，虽然还来轰炸，却足足有两个月不敢低飞了。
    两个月后的一天中午，突然来了五十多架敌机轰炸这一带的村庄、桥梁，也轰炸阵地。
    刘四眼看着村庄里的草房子起了火，又看到八架敌机向阵地附近袭来，保卫人民、保卫桥梁的战斗热情，在他心里燃烧着；他把方向调准，不等敌机投弹，迎头就打了一连串的炮火。第一架敌机冒着黑烟掉下来了。正在这当儿，另一架敌机紧跟着俯冲下来，刘四的右额上又负了重伤，血从眼角上流到脸上，流到他紧握着的方向盘上；他倒下了。班长跑过来，扶着他说：“快下去！”刘四抹了一下脸上的血，看了看班长，着急地说：“快打飞机，我是共产党员，有一口气就要和它拚到底！”他爬起来，双手去抓方向盘……可是血流的太多了，他刚刚抓到方向盘就昏倒在炮上了。
    炮手们仍然不停地射击着。敌机也一个劲地扫射着。
    在爆炸声中，刘四醒了过来，他爬了几步，倚着炮，端起步枪，不停地向飞机射击。阵地上的同志们高声喊着：“向共产党员刘四同志看齐！”
    在烟火迷漫的阵地上，高射炮火越来越猛烈地打击着敌机。在这些钢铁战士面前，敌人畏缩了，最后，终于逃跑了。
    刘四包好了伤口，点上一枝烟，几个同志围上来亲切地问着：“怎么样？还是下去休养休养吧。”刘四笑了笑说：“这祖国的烟抽的真长精神，又解困，又解乏；这祖国送来的炮真得劲，打得又准，又稳。”他看了看同志们，弄灭了烟放到口袋里，然后才说：“咱们还是先去看看炮吧。”
    战士们修筑着阵地，擦着炮，搬运着炮弹。十几分钟以后，阵地完全恢复正常，他们继续警惕地准备着打击敌人了。
    正在这时，远远地又传来了敌机的声音。炮手们迅速地站好位置。刘四这门炮上，一炮手的工作已经由战士吴玉生来代理。刘四非常关心地走过来，坐在一炮手的旁边，亲切地说：“小吴，听我说，我叫你往左瞄准，你就往左，叫你往右，你就往右，咱们这门炮可是没打过败仗。”
    阵地还是静静的。敌机越飞越近，等来到阵地上空时，就大胆地冲过来。 “预备，放！”刘四用左眼紧盯着敌机。
    一架敌机刚刚要往阵地上投弹，就被刘四的炮和一班的炮火连炸弹带飞机同时打中，这架敌机来不及把炸弹投下来，就在天空爆炸了。驾驶员直挺挺地摔死在炮兵阵地上。一枝六轮手枪，一个降落伞，成了炮手们的胜利品。
    ××桥还是日日夜夜地畅通着，敌人的飞机也还是常常来，可是它们飞得高了，炸弹也是远远地就投下来了，再不敢在高射炮阵地上那样放肆了。
    高射炮第三连一直警惕地执行着守卫××桥的任务。刘四一直没有离开他的战友，没有离开他的炮和他流过血保卫了并巩固了的阵地。
    在他们的连里，除去英雄们的胸前不断增加着勋章和奖章而外，还增加了上面写着“战胜敌机，保证运渡安全”十个大字的一面锦旗。这面锦旗是志愿军工兵部队、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民共同赠给他们的。（附图片）
