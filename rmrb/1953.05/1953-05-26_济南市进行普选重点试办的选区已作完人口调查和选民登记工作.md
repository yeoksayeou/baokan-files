Jinan Municipality began preparations for the general election on April 8th. Cadres were trained on the 13th, and the Municipal Election Committee was established on the 15th. After its establishment, the Municipal Election Committee studied the city's general election work plan and decided to conduct a key pilot project in the Second District.

The Second District of Jinan City has jurisdiction over six public security police stations, with a total population of 67,697 (statistics before the general election), divided into 44 electoral districts. The general election work started in the electoral districts within the scope of the second, fifth, and sixth police stations. Now, the work of training street cadres, preliminary publicity to the masses, population survey, and voter registration has been completed. Voter qualifications are being reviewed, and most voters have already received their voter registration cards. In addition, preliminary publicity to the masses has also been carried out in the electoral districts within the scope of the first, third, and fourth police stations, and population surveys and voter registration have begun.

The main method of publicity to the masses is for the reporters to prepare in advance and then give lectures to the masses. After the reporters prepare their lectures according to the publicity outline, they first select one or two reporters to conduct trial reports in one or two electoral districts, and other reporters participate in listening. After the report, they summarize the advantages and disadvantages based on the feedback from the masses, and supplement and revise the content. Then, each reporter goes to each electoral district to give lectures to the masses, and then the technical cadres or street cadres lead the masses to conduct group discussions. The lecture content is divided into two lessons: the first lesson is the significance of the general election, the main content of the election law, and the attitude that should be taken towards the general election; the second lesson is the population survey and voter qualification issues. The masses participate in listening to lectures in two shifts, day and night, and choose their own time to arrange it. In addition, manpower is organized to make up lessons for blank spots, and座谈discussions are held based on the ideological situation of the masses and different objects to carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization.

After the publicity, the broad masses have a certain understanding of the general election. The workers are in high spirits. They actively participate in street gatherings, listen attentively, and discuss seriously. For example, all 37 workers of the Yangyuan Weaving Factory, except for the three who stayed to look after the house, participated in the lectures and discussions. A photography industry workers group unanimously stated: We must take a step forward on the existing foundation, actively do a good job in our business, improve the quality of production to welcome the general election, and at the same time do a good job in publicity, especially pay attention to exposing the rumors of bad elements; we must also launch a struggle against bureaucracy, suppression of democracy, and violations of laws and disciplines. Street women, especially working women, are also very active, and most of them participated in the lectures and discussions. Industrial and commercial operators generally expressed their support, and some have already inquired about "how to nominate."

After in-depth mobilization, the broad masses conscientiously went to the registration station to register on time. Many people also prepared "draft lists," first recording the main items to be registered to avoid temporary negligence and save registration time. The masses who received voter registration cards were very happy, calling the voter registration card a "treasure" and "priceless." Some put their voter registration cards in boxes, some wrapped them in paper, and some put them in picture frames.

In the democratic movement with high mass enthusiasm, after serious discussions by the people, review by the review team, and approval by the government, some landlords legally changed their status and obtained voter registration cards. For example, a landlord in Xiaoxinglong Street, who had been selling vegetables for five years and had performed well, was very happy to have his status changed this time and obtained a voter registration card. His wife even came out to volunteer to wash clothes for military families. Some people who had worked in the Jiang Wei military and political organs had many concerns at the beginning of the general election. After review and approval by the review team, they were given voter registration cards and felt at ease. Cui Fenglou from Dongqiandao (who was the leader of the Sanqing Tuan during the Kuomintang rule) said happily when he received his voter registration card: "The liberation of the past five years has indeed given me a lot of education. This time the people gave me the right to vote. It is the happiest thing in my life." (Wu Dayu, An Rihua)

    济南市进行普选重点试办的选区已作完人口调查和选民登记工作
    济南市普选工作于四月八日开始准备，十三日调训干部，十五日成立了市选举委员会。市选举委员会成立后即研究了全市普选工作计划，并确定在第二区进行重点试验。
    济南市第二区共辖六个公安派出所，人口共计六万七千六百九十七人（普选前统计数字），划分为四十四个选区。普选工作先自第二、五、六三个派出所范围内的选区开始，现在已经作完了训练街道干部、对群众的初步宣传、人口调查、选民登记等工作，并正在审查选民资格，其中绝大部分选民已领得了选民证。另外的第一、三、四三个派出所范围内的选区，也已作过对群众的初步宣传，并已开始进行人口调查和选民登记的工作。
    对群众宣传的主要方式，是由报告员事先作好准备以后向群众进行讲课。报告员根据宣传提纲准备讲课后，先选一两个报告员在一两个选区试行报告，其他报告员参加旁听。报告后即根据群众反映，总结优缺点，并补充、修正内容，然后再由各报告员分赴各选区向群众进行讲课，然后再由技术干部或街道干部领导群众分组讨论。讲课内容分为二课：第一课是普选的意义、选举法的主要内容和对普选应抱的态度等；第二课是人口调查和选民资格问题。群众参加听课是分日、晚两班，由自己择好时间编定。此外并组织人力对空白点进行补课，根据群众思想情况，根据不同对象进行座谈讨论，深入宣传动员。
    经过宣传后，广大群众对普选都有了一定的认识。工人的情绪很高，他们积极参加街道集会，认真听讲、讨论。如?养院织布工厂工人，除留看家的三人外，其余三十七人全部参加了听讲和讨论。有一照像业工人小组一致表示：我们要在现有的基础上提高一步，积极搞好业务，提高生产质量来迎接普选，同时要做好宣传工作，特别要注意揭穿坏分子造谣；对官僚主义、压制民主和违法乱纪行为也要开展斗争。街道妇女特别是劳动妇女也很积极，大都参加了听课和讨论。工商业者一般也表示拥护，有些已在打听“如何提名”。
    广大群众经过深入动员，都很认真地按时到登记站进行登记。有许多人还准备了“草单”，先把要登记的主要项目记上，以免临时疏忽遗忘，并节省登记时间。领到了选民证的群众都很高兴，称选民证为“宝贝”、“千金难买”。他们有的把选民证放在箱子里，有的用纸包着，有的放在镜框里。
    在群众情绪高涨的民主运动中，经过人民群众认真讨论，审查小组审查和政府批准后，有些地主依法改变了成份，得到了选民证。如小兴隆街一地主，卖菜过了五年，平素表现还好；这次改变了成份，得到了选民证，很高兴。他的女人还出来要给军属义务洗衣服。有一些曾在蒋伪军政机关作过事的人员，在普选开始时存在着不少顾虑，经过审查小组审查同意，给予了选民证，也安了心。东前道崔凤楼（国民党统治时，系三青团分队长）在领得选民证时高兴地说：“解放五年来，的确使我受了很多教育，这次人民给了我选举权，真是一生中最高兴的事。”（吴大羽、安日华）
