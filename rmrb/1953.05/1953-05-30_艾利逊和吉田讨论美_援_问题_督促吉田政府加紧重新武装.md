Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - News: Immediately after arriving in Japan, the new U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison, began negotiations with the Yoshida government on the issue of U.S. "Mutual Security Agency" aid to Japan on the 28th, driving Japan to accelerate rearmament according to U.S. conditions.

According to Kyodo News, Allison "frankly stated the U.S. view on Mutual Security Agency aid" during his meeting with Yoshida. Although the details of this meeting were kept secret, Vice Foreign Minister Katsuzo Okumura of the Yoshida government had already preemptively revealed the nature of the negotiations at a press conference on the 25th, saying, "Mutual Security Agency aid will undoubtedly be centered on military aid, as is the case with other recipient countries." Okumura then revealed that the U.S. was using this "aid" as a means to urge the Yoshida government to step up rearmament, saying, "This naturally raises the issue of increasing Japan's defense capabilities, which is the most indispensable aspect of providing Japan with Mutual Security Agency aid." Okumura also revealed at the press conference that the "Mutual Security Agency Aid Agreement" that the U.S. is about to conclude with the Yoshida government will stipulate that the U.S. will send a "military advisory group" to be stationed in Japan to supervise Japan's rearmament. Okumura openly stated, "The general policy of the Japanese government is to accept Mutual Security Agency aid from the United States." Prior to this, the U.S. had already made preparations to strengthen the rearmament of Japan by utilizing "aid." In mid-May, the U.S. Department of Defense secretly dispatched Stevens and others to Japan to investigate the Yoshida government's preparations for accepting "Mutual Security Agency" "aid."

    艾利逊和吉田讨论美“援”问题
    督促吉田政府加紧重新武装
    【新华社二十九日讯】东京消息：美国新任驻日大使艾利逊在抵日之后，立即在二十八日开始和吉田政府就美国“共同安全署”的对日“援助”问题举行谈判，驱使日本按照美国的条件加速重新武装。
    据共同社透露，艾利逊在和吉田会谈时，“坦率地申述了美方关于共同安全署援助的意见”。尽管这次会谈的情况被保持秘密，但是，吉田政府副外务相奥村胜藏早在二十五日的记者招待会上预先透露了这次谈判的性质，他说：“共同安全署的援助无疑地将以军事援助为中心，就像其他受援国的情形一样。”奥村接着透露了美国以这种“援助”为督促吉田政府加紧重新武装的手段，他说：“这当然就引起了增加日本防卫力的问题，这是给日本以共同安全署援助的最不可缺少的一面。”奥村并在记者招待会上透露：美国将要和吉田政府订立的“共同安全署援助协定”，将规定由美国派遣一个“军事顾问团”来驻在日本监督日本重新武装。奥村公开表示，“日本政府的总政策是从美国接受共同安全署的援助”。在此以前，美国早已为利用“援助”加强重新武装日本一事进行了准备工作。五月中旬，美国国防部曾派遣史蒂文斯等人秘密到日本活动，调查吉田政府接受“共同安全署”“援助”的准备情况。
