Southwest Regions Establish Election Committees

The provinces and cities of Southwest China are actively carrying out various preparatory tasks for the universal suffrage movement. Election committees in Chongqing City and Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have been established successively with the approval of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council. The members of the election committees include representatives from all democratic classes, nationalities, democratic parties, and people's organizations. Women representatives also participate.

Currently, Sichuan, Xikang, Chongqing, and other regions have convened plenary meetings of all members of the election committees, established office organizations, initially studied how to formulate specific and feasible detailed plans, arranged the steps and timing for carrying out universal suffrage, and begun to plan the selection and training of cadres. Chongqing City convened a meeting of the heads of civil affairs sections from various districts to arrange the work of studying the Electoral Law and related documents. Sichuan Province has determined that all county election committees will be established by the beginning of May and hopes that all localities will complete all preparatory work for grassroots elections from the beginning of May to mid-June, focusing on selecting key areas, completing typical experiments, and training cadres. The Sichuan Provincial Election Committee has also organized four working groups to select a township each in Wenjiang, Neijiang, Jiangjin, and Suining to conduct universal suffrage experiments. Other regions, such as Guizhou and Chongqing, are also preparing to develop typical experimental plans. Guizhou Province has decided to select 400 cadres from the province's in-service cadres in the political and legal system and 200 to 600 graduates from the Nationalities Institute to undergo centralized training as key cadres for future grassroots election work. At the same time, it has been decided to immediately carry out publicity work for universal suffrage and organize all staff of the election committee and cadres from relevant departments to study.

The propaganda departments in various regions are now formulating plans and organizing forces to prepare for large-scale publicity on the great significance of the universal suffrage movement and the content of the Electoral Law. (According to Chongqing Xinhua Daily News)

Anshan Determines Steps for Grassroots Election Work

The Anshan City Election Committee in Northeast China convened a meeting in mid-April to study the steps for grassroots election work in the city. The meeting determined to start training cadres from the beginning of June, taking seven to ten days. Population surveys and voter registration work will be carried out in suburban areas from June 15th, and population surveys and voter registration work will be carried out in urban areas from July 15th. The entire city's grassroots election work is expected to be completed by the end of September.

In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient cadres and gradually absorb work experience, the meeting decided to adopt a batch-staggered approach in the work, that is, all 600 cadres selected will be transferred to work in the 33 villages in the four suburban districts after training. Each working group, composed of 15 to 18 cadres, will be assigned to every three villages, initially concentrating on working in one village. After the voter list is announced, two people will be left in this village (one of whom is the chairman of the village election committee), and the remaining personnel will go to the other two villages to work. After the voter list is announced, two cadres will still be left in each of these two villages. In this way, 400 of the 600 cadres in the suburbs can be withdrawn to work in the urban areas in early July. It is estimated that the election work in the suburban villages will be completed by mid-August, and the urban areas will be completed by the end of September. (Pan Shaobo, Yang Qingyu)

Jiangsu Deploys Grassroots Election Work

The Jiangsu Provincial Election Committee convened a joint meeting of the chairmen of the election committees of all cities and counties in the province from the 4th to the 11th to discuss and deploy grassroots election work.

The meeting decided to complete all preparatory work for grassroots elections in May and June. It stipulated that election committees at all levels should establish and improve office organizations before May, conduct cadre training on a county and city basis, and prepare for typical experiments. The Provincial Election Committee will conduct typical experiments in Jiangning County and summarize the experience before the end of June. The typical experiment work in Nanjing City will be carried out in June and July. The meeting required election committees at all levels to earnestly explain the great significance of universal suffrage and its close relationship with the people in the publicity work of the Electoral Law, so that all voters can recognize their right to vote, pay attention to voter registration work, and actively participate in the election. The meeting required election committees at all levels to prepare all seals, forms, and other preparations, and decided to conduct grassroots election work in two batches in July, August, September, and October.

The meeting pointed out that the discussion of grassroots election work in various places must be closely combined with production and disaster relief, and the work of opposing bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline. In the voter registration work, the voter qualifications must be clarified, and no voter's right to vote can be lost, nor can a counter-revolutionary element illegally obtain the right to vote.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    西南各地成立选举委员会
    西南各省、市正积极进行普选运动的各项准备工作。重庆市及四川、西康、贵州、云南等省的选举委员会，已相继经中央人民政府政务院批准成立。选举委员会的委员包括各民主阶级、各民族、各民主党派、各人民团体的代表人物。其中也有妇女代表参加。
    目前，四川、西康、重庆等地都已召开了选举委员会的全体委员会议，成立了办公机构；初步研究了如何订立具体可行的详细计划；安排进行普选的步骤和时间；着手筹划选调干部，进行训练。重庆市召集了各区民政科长会议，布置了学习选举法及有关文件的工作。四川省已确定各县选举委员会在五月初全部成立，并希望各地在五月初到六月中旬完成基层选举的一切准备工作，其中主要是选择重点地区，完成典型试验工作和训练干部的工作。四川省选举委员会还组织了四个工作组，分别到温江、内江、江津、遂宁等地各选择一个乡进行普选实验。其他如贵州、重庆等地也准备订出典型实验计划。贵州省已决定从全省在职干部中抽调政法系统干部四百人及民族学院毕业学员二百人至六百人集中进行训练，作为将来基层选举工作中的骨干干部。同时决定立即开展普选的宣传工作，组织选举委员会全体工作人员及有关部门的干部进行学习。
    各地宣传部门现在正在制订计划与组织力量，准备大规模地宣传普选运动的伟大意义和选举法的内容。        （据重庆新华日报消息）
    鞍山确定基层选举工作步骤
    东北鞍山市选举委员会于上月中旬召开会议，研究了该市基层选举工作步骤。会上确定从六月初开始，以七天到十天的时间训练干部。六月十五日起进行郊区人口调查和选民登记工作，七月十五日起进行城区人口调查和选民登记工作。全市的基层选举工作预计到九月底即可全部结束。
    为解决干部不足的困难和逐步吸取工作经验，会议确定在工作中采取分批交错的方式进行，即是将所抽调的六百名干部，经过学习后，全部调到郊区四个区三十三个村中工作。每三个村派一个由十五名至十八名干部组成的工作组，首先集中在一个村内工作。待选民名单公布后，此村留下二人（其中一人是村选举委员会主席），其余人员即分头到其他两村进行工作。到选民名单公布后，这两村每村仍留干部二人。这样，郊区六百名干部中，七月初旬就可抽回四百名到城区进行工作。估计郊区各村的选举工作八月中旬即可结束，城区九月底即可结束。        　（潘少博、杨庆宇）
    江苏布置基层选举工作
    江苏省选举委员会于四日到十一日召开全省各市、县选举委员会主席联席会议，讨论与布置基层选举工作。
    会议决定五、六两月把基层选举的准备工作全部做好。规定各级选举委员会在五月以前建立与健全办公机构，并以县、市为单位进行干部训练并做好典型试验的准备工作。省选举委员会在江宁县进行典型试验，要在六月底以前总结出经验。南京市的典型试验工作于六七两月进行。会议要求各级选举委员会在进行选举法的宣传工作中，要认真地说明普选的重大意义和与人民群众的切身关系，使所有选民认识到自己的选举权利，关心选民登记工作和积极参加选举。会议要求各级选举委员会，做好一切印信、表册等各项准备工作，并决定七、八、九、十四个月分两批进行基层选举工作。
    会议指出，各地讨论基层选举工作，必须和生产救灾，反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的工作密切结合进行。在选民登记工作中要把选民资格搞清楚，不能错失一个选民的选举权利，也不让一个反革命分子非法得到选举权利。   （新华社）
