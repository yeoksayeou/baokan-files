Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 27th – From May 21st to 25th, the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers on the Eastern and Central Fronts conducted nine more victorious counter-attacks and ambushes, annihilating one enemy company, seven entire platoons, and most of one squad, totaling more than 460 enemy troops. Meanwhile, on the Western Front, our army inflicted many losses on the enemy in multiple ambushes and surprise attacks.

The most intense fighting occurred on the Eastern Front at the Yuyin Mountain front line in a battle for a hilltop, which served as a supporting point for the Rhee army's 20th Division's important position – Height 1089.6. Since our army captured this hilltop on the 16th, we have been fighting the frantically counter-attacking enemy for eight days. Since the 21st, the enemy has launched seven to ten counter-attacks against this hilltop every day, with enemy aircraft averaging over 100 sorties daily to cover the counter-attacks. However, the counter-attacking enemy has been met with staunch resistance from our army every day. At noon on the 24th, the enemy used two companies of troops to launch an attack on this hilltop in three directions. Our army took only 25 minutes to defeat the enemy, killing or wounding over 100 enemy troops, while our army suffered only six casualties.

From May 21st to 25th, our front-line mobile artillery killed or wounded a total of 548 enemy troops; our front-line anti-aircraft artillery shot down nine enemy aircraft and damaged twenty-eight enemy aircraft.

    朝中人民部队五天毙伤敌军一千名
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】五月二十一日到二十五日，东线和中线的朝中人民部队又进行了九次胜利的反击战和袭击战，歼灭敌军一个连、七个整排和一个排的大部，共计四百六十多名。同时西线我军也在多次袭击和伏击战中使敌人遭受了许多损失。
    全线打得最激烈的，是东线鱼隐山前线一个山头的争夺战，这个山头是李伪军第二十师重要阵地——一零八九点六高地的支撑点。我军自十六日攻克这个山头以后，已经与疯狂反扑的敌人在这里争夺了八天。自二十一日以来，敌人每天向这个山头反扑七次到十多次，掩护反扑的敌机平均每天出动达一百架次以上，但反扑的敌人每天都受到我军顽强的打击。二十四日中午，敌人用两个连的兵力分三路向这个山头发起攻击，我军只用二十五分钟时间即将敌击溃，杀伤敌军一百多名，而我军仅伤亡六人。
    二十一日到二十五日，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军五百四十八名；我军前线高射炮火共击落敌机九架，击伤敌机二十八架。
