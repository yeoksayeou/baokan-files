    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. On May 13th, the U.S. side killed a captured member of the Korean People's Army in the Masan POW camp. According to the U.S. side, the prisoner of war was killed by another prisoner of war who was also undergoing a psychiatric examination. It is known that the Masan POW camp is where the U.S. side detains so-called "anti-communist" prisoners of war. The incident on May 13th reveals that there are many prisoners of war suffering from mental illness in this POW camp, which is clearly the evil consequence of the U.S. side's strong suppression of the prisoners of war's desire to return home and forced detention of prisoners of war. Among the sick and wounded prisoners of war repatriated to us by the U.S. side in the exchange, there were a large number of people suffering from mental illness. After returning to their motherland, they still murmured: "I want to go back to my motherland! Let me go back!"

    美方又害死战俘一名
    【新华社开城十九日电】五月十三日，美方在马山战俘营中害死朝鲜人民军被俘人员一名。据美方声称，这名战俘是在受精神病检查时被另一个也是受精神病检查的战俘打死的。大家知道，马山战俘营是美方拘留所谓“反共”战俘的地方，五月十三日的事件透露了在这个战俘营中有不少患精神病的战俘，而这显然是美方强力压抑战俘要求回家的愿望、强迫扣留战俘所造成的恶果。在交换病伤被俘人员中美方遣返给我方的战俘中，就有大批患精神病的人，他们在回到祖国以后还喃喃地说：“我要回祖国！让我回去吧！”
