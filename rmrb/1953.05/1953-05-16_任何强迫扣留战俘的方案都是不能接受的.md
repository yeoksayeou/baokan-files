The people of the world increasingly urgently desire a ceasefire in Korea. The Korean-Chinese delegation has successively put forward two constructive plans for resolving the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war at the ceasefire negotiation conference, especially the eight-point plan of May 7, which has received sympathy and support from world public opinion. It is obvious that as long as the US government has the sincerity to truly achieve a ceasefire, an agreement can be reached immediately. However, after repeatedly raising a large number of irrelevant administrative details and entangling for a while, the US negotiation representatives unexpectedly put forward a so-called "counter-proposal" on May 13 with the aim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, attempting to overturn the basis of the current negotiations between the two sides. This fully exposes the US government's continued lack of sincerity in achieving a ceasefire in Korea. Our Mr. Nam Il resolutely rejected the US "counter-proposal" at the negotiation meeting on May 14, which was completely justified.

The US "counter-proposal" of May 13 lists as many as twenty-six articles. Upon analysis, its content is nothing more than two parts. One part belongs to basic principles, and the other part belongs to administrative details. Its basic principle part is completely wrong and fundamentally unworkable; therefore, even if its administrative detail part has merits, it is naturally out of the question. The reason why its basic principle part is wrong and unworkable is because its essence is to forcibly detain prisoners of war and to overturn the negotiation basis that was determined when both sides resumed negotiations.

As everyone knows, the current basis for negotiations between the two sides is the joint proposal on resolving the issue of all prisoners of war in the statements issued successively by Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Kim Il-sung on March 30 and 31, 1953. This proposal was put forward in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention. That is: "The negotiating parties should guarantee the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation after the ceasefire, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries to ensure a fair solution to their repatriation issue." All the concessions made by our side thereafter were based on this basis. The US side has stated more than once that it agrees with the basic principles of our proposal. However, the so-called "counter-proposal" now put forward by the United States clearly violates the basic principles of our proposal, that is, violates the principles of the Geneva Convention, and retreats to the old path of forcibly detaining prisoners of war that the US side insisted on in the past, thereby undermining the current basis for negotiations between the two sides. The regressive and erroneous essence of the US "counter-proposal" is manifested in four aspects.

The first aspect showing the US destruction of the current basis for negotiations between the two sides is that it divides the captured personnel of China and North Korea, and openly wants to "release on the spot" the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who account for more than two-thirds of the total number and are not directly repatriated after the ceasefire, instead of transferring them to neutral countries to ensure a fair solution to their repatriation issue. People can imagine that these captured personnel who are not directly repatriated are afraid to go home due to long-term fear under the coercion and oppression of the other side. If they are not released from the military control of the detaining party and transferred to neutral countries, and after explanations by relevant parties, they cannot be guaranteed to have the right to return home. This is a self-evident truth that does not require experimentation. The US side explained that these prisoners of war "will not be unable to return home because they cannot cross the battle line between the warring parties." This is of course an unreasonable and unfounded statement, and no one will believe this statement. From this unreasonable explanation of the United States, people can clearly see the true intention of the United States, which is to destroy the right of the largest part of prisoners of war to return home, and to forcibly detain the largest part of prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called "release on the spot." This is unacceptable no matter what.

The second aspect of the US destruction of the current basis for negotiations between the two sides is that it uses various restrictions to make the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission unable to work and paralyzed, which is actually equivalent to depriving the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of its powers. The US "counter-proposal" only allows one of the five countries participating in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to provide armed forces, and the other four countries are only allowed to send one representative and no more than ten assistants. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission formed in this way is also placed in a very dangerous environment surrounded and controlled by US armed forces. The US "counter-proposal" openly proposes that "the prisoner of war camps are actually under the military control of the detaining party," the army of the detaining party only retreats two kilometers from the prisoner of war residence, and "the detaining party provides the necessary enforcement and security forces" within the surveillance area, and "the detaining party provides a certain number of unarmed personnel to work, or provides services within the prisoner of war camps under its military control." This is simply a large-scale military encirclement of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the prisoner of war camps, making the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also a "turtle in a jar," making it completely unable to work and can only be paralyzed. Moreover, the US "counter-proposal" also proposes that the handling of all issues other than procedures in this Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must obtain unanimous consent. That is to say, in this committee that actually carries out repatriation work, the right to make decisions by majority vote and the right of neutral countries to arbitrate in accordance with the Geneva Convention are cancelled. With so many extremely unreasonable restrictions on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the result is to actually deprive this committee of its legitimate duties and power to administer prisoners of war, forcing it to become an ornament for the United States to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This is completely contrary to the purpose of our proposal to form a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, respect their neutral status and give them the due power of arbitration, so as to fairly resolve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation.

The third aspect of the US destruction of the current basis for negotiations between the two sides is that it tries its best to restrict the freedom and convenience of the relevant party to explain to the prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The US "counter-proposal" openly proposes that the representatives of the relevant party who explain to its captured personnel "can send at most one person for every thousand prisoners of war under the supervision of the surveillance committee." Here, it is not difficult for people to imagine that in a prisoner of war detention site under severe military encirclement and control, it is absolutely difficult for one person to explain to a thousand prisoners of war who are suspicious. This is actually an invisible deprivation of the freedom of the relevant party to explain to its captured personnel, and at the same time, it is also a deprivation of the legitimate powers of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This is also fundamentally in conflict with the principles of our proposal. Because according to our proposal, there should be full freedom and convenience for explaining to prisoners of war, and this freedom and convenience should be specifically arranged by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Now the US "counter-proposal" puts forward such unreasonable restrictions, which shows that the United States wants to arrange
a gloomy and terrifying dragnet, so that the freedom and convenience of the relevant party to carry out explanatory work and the right of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to make arrangements become empty words. It is obvious that this will make the work of the relevant party to explain to its captured personnel only a formality, and even the formality cannot be achieved. As a result, the prisoners of war who are suspicious will naturally not be able to eliminate their doubts, and the United States will have an excuse to forcibly detain the prisoners of war and deprive them of their right to return home. This is completely unreasonable and we can never accept it.

The fourth aspect of the US destruction of the current basis for negotiations between the two sides is that it limits the prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. After two months, if there are still those who have not dispelled their doubts and dare not go home, they will also be forcibly detained in the name of "release on the spot." This is another open violation of the basic principles of prisoner of war repatriation. Our proposal insists that our captured personnel who are afraid to return home under the coercion and oppression of the other side must be given a fair solution to their repatriation issue after sufficient explanation after the ceasefire. In order to fully carry out explanatory work, our side has suggested that four months is a reasonable period; after this period, if there are still prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the issue of their handling should be submitted to the political conference for resolution. However, the US "counter-proposal" not only makes various unreasonable restrictions on major issues such as the supervision and explanation work of prisoners of war, but also shortens the time to sixty days, and those who pass this deadline will be "released on the spot," making the prisoners of war still under the military control and jurisdiction of the United States and South Korea, living a disguised life as prisoners. This is clearly an unreasonable practice for the purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Anyone with a little humanitarian view of prisoners of war cannot agree to this practice of the United States.

Analyzing the so-called "counter-proposal" of the United States from the above four aspects, it comes down to the essential issue, which is: the United States is trying to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Although the so-called "counter-proposal" of the United States has as many as twenty-six articles, except for this essential issue, the rest are just some details. This essential issue is the stem, and those details are the branches and leaves. If the stem does not exist, where will the branches and leaves be? If the United States has the sincerity to achieve a ceasefire in Korea, it must seek a solution on the essential issue. This is to require the United States to change the basic principle part of this "counter-proposal" and maintain the current basis for negotiations between the two sides in order to help solve the problem.

### 任何强迫扣留战俘的方案都是不能接受的

    任何强迫扣留战俘的方案都是不能接受的
    全世界人民日益迫切地渴望朝鲜停战。朝中代表团在停战谈判会议上先后提出了解决全部战俘遣返问题的两个建设性方案，特别是五月七日的八点方案，得到世界各国舆论的同情和支持。只要美国政府有真正实现停战的诚意，现在就可以立即达成协议，这是显而易见的。但是，美国的谈判代表在反复提出了一大堆无关紧要的行政细节问题，纠缠了一阵之后，竟又在五月十三日提出了以强迫扣留战俘为目的的所谓“反建议”，企图推翻目前双方谈判的基础。这就充分暴露了美国政府对于实现朝鲜停战仍然缺乏诚意。我方南日大将于五月十四日的谈判会议上，坚决拒绝了美国的这个“反建议”，这是完全正当的。
    美国五月十三日的“反建议”，列出二十六条之多，分析起来，它的内容不外乎两个部分。一部分是属于基本原则的，一部分是属于行政细节的。它的基本原则部分是完全错误的，是根本行不通的；因此，它的行政细节部分即便有可取之处，自然也无从谈起了。它的基本原则部分之所以是错误的、行不通的，就因为它的实质是要强迫扣留战俘，是要推翻双方恢复谈判时就已确定了的谈判基础。
    举世周知，目前双方谈判的基础，乃是一九五三年三月三十日和三十一日周恩来总理和金日成元帅先后发表的声明中关于解决全部战俘问题的共同建议。这个建议是按照日内瓦公约的原则而提出的。这就是：“谈判双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。”此后我方所作的让步都是在这个基础上进行的。美方曾经不止一次表示同意我方建议的基本原则。但是，现在美国提出的所谓“反建议”却显然违反了我方建议的基本原则，也就是违反了日内瓦公约的原则，而退回到美方过去所固执的强迫扣留战俘的老路上去，从而也就破坏着目前双方谈判的基础。美国的这个“反建议”的倒退的、错误的实质表现在四个方面。
    表现着美国破坏目前双方谈判基础的第一个方面，是它把中朝被俘人员分割开来，公然要将占总数三分之二以上的不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，在停战后即行“就地释放”，而不转交给中立国以保证他们的遣返问题得到公正的解决。人们可以想见，这些不直接遣返的被俘人员，因长期在对方恐吓和压迫下心存疑惧，以致不敢回家，如果不把他们从拘留方面的武力控制之下释放出来转交中立国，经过有关方面的解释，就不能保证他们能够得到回家的权利。这是不待尝试而自明的道理。美方解释说，这些战俘“就地释放”以后，“不会由于他们不能越过交战双方之间的战线而回不去家”，这当然是不合常理的毫无根据的说法，谁都不会相信这种说法的。从美国的这种不合常理的解释中，人们显然可以看到美国的真实意图，就是要破坏这最大部分战俘回家的权利，就是要在所谓“就地释放”的借口下强迫扣留这最大部分战俘。这是无论如何不能被接受的。
    美国破坏目前双方谈判基础的第二个方面的表现，就是它用种种的限制使中立国遣返委员会无法进行工作，陷于瘫痪状态，实际上等于剥夺了中立国遣返委员会的职权。美国的“反建议”中对于参加中立国遣返委员会的五个国家，只允许其中的一个国家提供武装部队，其他四个国家只被允许派一个代表和不得超过十名的助手。这样组成的中立国遣返委员会又是被放在被美国武装包围控制的非常险恶的环境中的。美国的“反建议”公然提出“战俘看管处所实际上处于拘留一方军事控制之下”，拘留一方的军队仅仅从战俘居留地点撤退两公里，而在看管地区之内还由“拘留一方供给必要的执行和保安部队”，并且由“拘留一方提供一定的非武装人员以进行工作，或在其军事管制下的地区内看管战俘的处所之内提供服务”。这简直就是对中立国遣返委员会和战俘看管处所实行大规模的军事包围，使中立国遣返委员会也变成了“瓮中之鳖”，使它完全不能进行工作，只能瘫痪下去。而且美国的“反建议”还提出，在这中立国遣返委员会中，对于程序以外的各项问题的处理，都必须取得一致的同意。这就是说，在这个实际执行遣返工作的委员会中，多数票的决定权及依据日内瓦公约规定的中立国的公断权都被取消了。对于中立国遣返委员会做了这许多极不合理的限制，其结果就是在实际上剥夺了这个委员会的合法职务和管辖战俘的权力，逼使它变成美国实行强迫扣留战俘的装饰品。这和我方建议组成的中立国遣返委员会，尊重他们的中立地位并给他们以应有的公断权力，以便公正解决战俘遣返问题的目的，完全背道而驰。
    美国破坏目前双方谈判基础的第三个方面的表现，就是它极力限制有关一方向中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘进行解释的自由与便利。美国的“反建议”公然提出，有关一方向它的被俘人员进行解释工作的代表，“在看管委员会所看管的每一千名战俘中，最多只能派一名”。在这里，人们不难想见，处在严重的军事包围与控制的战俘拘留地点内，以一个人去向一千个心怀疑惧的战俘进行解释，是绝对难以收效的。这在实际上是对于有关一方向它的被俘人员进行解释的自由权利的一种无形的剥夺，同时，这也是对于中立国遣返委员会的合法职权的一种剥夺。这和我方建议的原则也是根本抵触的。因为按照我方的建议，向战俘进行解释工作应有充分的自由与便利，而这种自由与便利应由中立国遣返委员会作具体的安排。现在美国的“反建议”提出这样无理的限制，就是表明美国要安排
    一个阴森恐怖的天罗地网，使有关一方进行解释工作的自由与便利和中立国遣返委员会进行安排的权利都成了废话。显然可以想见，这就将使有关一方向它的被俘人员进行解释的工作徒具形式，甚至于连形式也不能做到。其结果，自然会使心存疑惧的战俘不能消除其疑惧，而美国就有借口来强迫扣留战俘，剥夺战俘回家的权利。这完全是不讲理的做法，我们决不能接受。
    美国破坏目前双方谈判基础的第四个方面的表现，就是它对于在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘，限定两个月之后，如果仍有疑惧未消不敢回家的，也以“就地释放”为名加以强迫扣留。这又是公然违反战俘遣返的基本原则的。我方建议坚持必须将在对方恐吓和压迫下心存疑惧不敢回家的我方被俘人员，在停战以后，经过充分的解释，保证他们的遣返问题能得到公正解决。为了充分进行解释工作，我方曾建议以四个月为合理期限；在这期限以后，如果还有在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘，关于他们的处理问题，应提交政治会议去解决。但是，现在美国的“反建议”不但对于战俘的看管和解释工作等重大事项做了种种无理的限制，而且要缩短时间为六十天，过了这个期限的即行“就地释放”，使战俘仍然处在美国和南朝鲜的武力控制和管辖之下过变相的俘虏生活。这分明是为了强迫扣留战俘而毫不讲理的一种做法。任何对于战俘抱有一点人道主义观点的人都不能同意美国的这种做法。
    从以上四个方面的表现来分析美国的所谓“反建议”，归结到本质的问题上，就只得出一个结论，这就是：美国力图强迫扣留战俘。美国的所谓“反建议”虽然有二十六条之多，除了这个本质问题以外，其余都不过是一些细节问题而已。这个本质问题是茎干，那些细节问题是枝叶。茎干不存，枝叶何有？如果美国有实现朝鲜停战的诚意，就必须在本质问题上求得解决。这就是要美国改变现在这个“反建议”的基本原则部分，维护目前双方谈判的基础，才能有助于问题的解决。
