    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 3rd: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the seven American civilians released by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea met with reporters from Pyongyang newspapers and the Korean Central News Agency before leaving for home, an arrangement made by the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    Bertha Smith, a former American missionary in Seoul, said in a statement to reporters: "Although the Korean government is in a state of war, it has done everything possible to treat us with kindness. The rich daily nutrition, appropriate exercise, and cultural and recreational life have often made us forget our longing for home." She stated that she would never forget the humanitarian treatment given by the Korean government.

    Louis L. Lens, a former American businessman in Seoul, said: "Although we are civilians of the United States, a country hostile to the Korean government, we have also been treated kindly by the Korean government. Thanks to the special care of the Korean government, we are now able to return home in good health. Therefore, I feel infinite happiness. When Americans see us return in good health, they will know that the distorted propaganda in American publications about the Korean government's treatment of foreign prisoners is full of deception, hypocrisy, and slander." He condemned the US side for violating humanitarian principles and committing criminal acts of indiscriminate bombing aimed at massacring peaceful residents; and said that he was determined to fight for peace.

    Former American missionaries in Seoul, Nellie Dale, Anders K. Jensen, William Booth, and others all stated that after returning home, they would tell their own people about the Korean people's struggle for peace, independence, and freedom, and would work with peace-loving people in the United States to quickly end the Korean War.

    Helen Rosser, a missionary who came to Korea in 1924, explained that during her time in North Korea, their religious life was not subject to any restrictions or interference.

    These seven American civilians finally asked the reporters to convey their repeated expressions of gratitude to the Korean government to all the Korean people.

    被释放的美国平民发表谈话
    感谢朝鲜政府的宽待与关怀
   【新华社平壤三日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社消息：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所释放的七名美国平民，在动身回国之前，由于朝鲜外务省的安排，和平壤各报及朝鲜中央通讯社记者会见。
    前美国在汉城的传教士伯萨·史密斯在对记者们发表的谈话中说：“朝鲜政府虽然处在战争环境中，但是它还是尽一切力量来宽待我们。日常的丰富的营养、适当的运动和文化娱乐生活，使得我们往往忘记了对家乡的怀念。”他表示将永远不忘朝鲜政府所给予的人道主义待遇。
    前美国在汉城的商人路易斯·勒·丹斯说：“我们虽然是朝鲜政府的敌对国家美国的平民，但是我们也受到了朝鲜政府的宽待。由于朝鲜政府的特别关怀，我们现在能够身体健康地回家去。因此，我感到无限的幸福。美国人看到我们身体健康地回去的时候，将会知道美国出版物关于朝鲜政府对待外国俘虏情况的歪曲宣传是充满了欺骗、虚伪和诽谤的。”他谴责美方违反人道主义原则，以屠杀和平居民为目的而进行滥炸的犯罪行为；并且说，他决心为和平而奋斗。
    前美国在汉城的传教士奈利·戴尔，安德斯·克·詹逊，威廉·布斯等都表示，在回国以后，要把朝鲜人民为和平、独立、自由而战的情形告诉本国人民，并要和美国爱好和平的人民一起为迅速停止朝鲜战争而努力。
    一九二四年就到朝鲜的传教士海伦·罗赛说明，在北朝鲜的期间，她们的宗教生活没有受到任何限制和干涉。
    这七名美国平民最后都要求记者们把他们对于朝鲜政府一再表示的谢意，转达给全体朝鲜人民。
