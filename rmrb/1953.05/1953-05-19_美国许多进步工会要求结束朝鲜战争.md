Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th. "Pravda's" New York correspondent, Litoshenko, reported in a dispatch about the struggle of progressive American workers for peace.

Litoshenko pointed out that the idea of uniting all forces to fight for peace is gaining more and more powerful support among the broad masses of American working people.

Right-wing union leaders have put a lot of effort into undermining the American workers' will to fight for peace, forcing them to obediently sacrifice for interests that are not related to them. Many union leaders often advocate war and oppose international cooperation. But workers are increasingly determined to demand an end to the arms race and a peaceful resolution of international disputes.

The resolutions passed at the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) conference in April expressed the hope of fully utilizing the new opportunities for achieving peace. The clear and concrete proposals of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have aroused hopes for peace in the hearts of American workers, because these proposals lay the foundation for a fair resolution of the contentious prisoner-of-war issue and lead to the immediate cessation of hostilities in Korea. These proposals have received full support from many local union organizations.

Many unions have emphasized in their statements that the road to peace can only be achieved through negotiations. The Congress of the United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), affiliated with the CIO, passed a resolution in March calling for the peaceful resolution of international differences. This largest union in the United States, with more than 1.3 million members, demands that the road to peace be kept open at all times.

Tens of thousands of American textile workers link their hopes for employment to peace, because in the years after the war, the number of unemployed in the textile industry, like many other sectors of light industry, increased by 33 percent; after the outbreak of the Korean War, the number of unemployed increased particularly sharply. Thousands of garment workers are either unemployed or only work two or three days a week.

Independent progressive unions have put forward the clearest and most consistent peace program. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) convention, which ended in April, unanimously passed a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Korea, disarmament, a ban on the use of atomic bombs and bacteriological weapons, and the elimination of obstacles hindering the development of trade between countries.

The recent statement by the Executive Committee of the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA), affiliated with the CIO, pointed out that the American union leadership has not paid enough attention to the issue of peace. The statement also pointed out that American workers are full of hope for peace and demand that all American unions speak out loudly to defend peace and strive to end the Korean War.

    美国许多进步工会要求结束朝鲜战争
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：“真理报”驻纽约记者利托希科在一篇通讯中报道美国进步工人争取和平斗争的情况。
    利托希科指出：团结一切力量为保卫和平而斗争的思想在广大的美国劳动人民之间正得到愈来愈有力的支持。
    右翼工会领袖化了不少力量来破坏美国工人争取和平的意志，迫使他们顺从地为与他们无关的利益牺牲。许多工会领袖常常鼓吹战争、反对国际合作。但是工人们正日益坚决地要求结束军备竞赛、和平解决国际争执问题。
    四月里举行的派货加工工人工会会议在决议中表示，希望充分利用取得和平的新机会。中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的明晰而具体的建议在美国工人的心中引起了和平的希望，因为这些建议奠立了公正解决争执不下的战俘问题和导致立刻结束朝鲜敌对行为的基础。这些建议已得到许多工会地方组织的充分支持。
    许多工会在它们的声明中着重指出，只有通过谈判才能走上和平的道路。三月里举行的美国联合汽车、飞机与农业工具工人工会属产联代表大会通过决议，要求以和平方法解决国际间的分歧。美国这个最大的工会拥有会员一百三十万人以上，它要求始终开放走向和平的道路。
    成千累万的美国纺织工人把他们就业的希望与和平联系在一起，因为在战后几年里，纺织工业，像轻工业的其它许多部门一样，失业人数增加了百分之三十三；朝鲜战争爆发后，失业人数增加得特别厉害。数千成衣工人不是失业，就是每星期只工作两三天。
    独立的进步工会提出了最明晰、最一贯的和平纲领。四月里结束的国际码头与仓库工人工会代表大会一致通过了一项决议，要求立刻停止朝鲜的敌对行为、裁减军备、禁止使用原子弹和细菌武器以及消除阻碍各国间的贸易发展的障碍。
    美国联合屠宰工人工会（属产联）执行委员会最近的声明指出美国工会领导没有给予和平问题足够的注意。声明还指出美国工人正满怀希望地期望和平，并要求所有美国工会大声疾呼保卫和平、争取结束朝鲜战争。
