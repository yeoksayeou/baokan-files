Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a notice on preventing pests and protecting autumn seedlings on the 23rd. The notice pointed out: Currently, autumn seedlings in many areas are being attacked by pests. In fourteen counties in Henan Province, including Huangchuan, Huaibin, Gushi, and Xincai, pests such as armyworms, cutworms, and cotton aphids have been found to be harming wheat and autumn seedlings. In Shandong Province, the area affected by pests has reached 3.8 million mu, with wireworms, grubs, and cutworms being the most serious, and wheat spider mites are also widespread. Pests such as rice stem borers, leaf beetles, and casebearers are harming rice seedlings in the southern rice-growing areas. Although the climate in the Northeast is colder, beetles and sand beetles have also been discovered. In Gaiping County alone, more than 10,000 hectares of cultivated land have been affected by the aforementioned pests. Cotton seedlings in various areas are already being harmed by cotton aphids. The above situation shows that the peak season for pest outbreaks has arrived. In order to better carry out the work of preventing pests and protecting autumn seedlings, the notice puts forward the following four points: 1. Strengthen pest prediction and forecasting work, and keep abreast of the pest occurrence situation. Mobilize and organize the masses of farmers, combine with various agricultural activities, conduct field inspections, and promptly eliminate pests when they are discovered to prevent them from spreading and expanding. 2. At any time, summarize the pest control experience of the masses of farmers, and improve pest control technology. At present, due to certain limitations in the production and supply of pesticides and machinery, in addition to pests such as locusts, cotton aphids, and red spiders, the control of general pests should still be mainly based on manual capture, and attention should be paid to studying and utilizing cultivation systems and cultivation methods for prevention and control. 3. For rice stem borers, measures such as collecting eggs in seedling fields and luring moths with lights should be taken promptly. For cutworms, the main method is manual searching and capture. For mole crickets, poisonous bait and poisonous grains can be used, and pits can be dug to trap and kill them. For armyworms, the method of using insect-catching vehicles and insect-catching nets should be implemented. 4. Because the types of pests, distribution areas, and time of occurrence and harm are different, all localities should carry out prevention and control according to the specific circumstances.

    中央人民政府农业部发出防治虫害保护秋苗的通知
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府农业部在二十三日发出关于防治害虫保护秋苗的通知。通知指出：目前不少地区的秋苗受到害虫的侵袭。河南省潢川、淮滨、固始、新蔡等十四个县发现粘虫、土蚕、棉蚜等害虫为害麦子和秋苗。山东省发生虫害的面积已达三百八十万亩，其中以金针虫、蛴螬、地老虎为害最严重，麦蜘蛛也很普遍。螟蛾、铁甲虫、负泥虫等害虫，在南方稻区加害秧苗。东北气候较冷，但金龟子、砂潜虫也已发现，仅盖平一县就有一万余垧耕地发生上述害虫。各地棉苗已有棉蚜为害。以上情况说明，害虫盛发季节业已到来。为了更好地开展防治害虫、保护秋苗的工作，通知中提出以下四点意见：一、加强治虫预测预报工作，及时掌握害虫发生情况。动员和组织农民群众，结合各种农事活动，进行田间检查，发现虫害，迅速消灭，勿使蔓延扩大。二、随时总结农民群众的治虫经验，提高治虫技术。目前由于药械生产供应有一定限制，除蝗虫、棉蚜、红蜘蛛等害虫外，一般害虫的防治仍应以人工捕捉为主，并注意研究利用耕作制度、栽培方法来进行防治。三、对于水稻螟虫，目前应抓紧秧田采卵和点灯诱蛾等办法。对于地老虎，主要是靠人工搜捕。对于蝼蛄，可用毒饵、毒谷，挖坑诱杀。对于粘虫，应贯彻用捕虫车、捕虫兜等器械捕打办法。四、由于害虫的种类、分布地区和发生为害的时间都有不同，各地应根据具体情况进行防治。
