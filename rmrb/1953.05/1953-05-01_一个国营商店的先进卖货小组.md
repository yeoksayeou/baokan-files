An Advanced Sales Group in a State-Owned Store
    Cai Jing

    The sales staff of the Liu Shuzhen (Hardware and Electrical Materials) Group of the Second Department Store of the Shenyang Municipal Department Store have brought their initiative into play, established a correct labor attitude, and improved their working methods, transforming the group's work from backward to advanced, from passive to active, and from blind operation to planned operation. They have set a concrete example for grassroots sales units in state-owned stores to improve business management, implement economic accounting systems, and accurately supply the needs of production and consumers.

    Correcting the Attitude of Serving Customers

    The attitude of the sales staff of the Liu Shuzhen Group towards their work in the past was:

    "The goods are on the shelves, customers can buy them if they want, and if they don't buy them, I have less trouble!" Many customers said that the sales staff were "like wooden men" and were unwilling to deal with them. Therefore, the group's sales targets were never completed. Last year, when the industrial product sales campaign was launched in the second quarter, the sales targets were very high, and the group leader Liu Shuzhen lacked confidence. But she thought:

    "If the worker brothers can produce it, can't we sell it? Besides, I am a group leader, how can I take the lead in complaining?" She thought that the Party branch secretary had said: to complete the task, we must rely on the masses, educate the masses, and establish the idea of serving the needs of production and people's lives. So she led everyone in the group to criticize the ideas of Yao Min, who was representative of those who were not at ease in their work and looked down on commercial work and the hired labor viewpoint, and launched a study to examine their thinking and work. When everyone realized that the quality of their work directly affected the country's economic construction, confidence and strength came. From then on, through criticism and self-criticism, they gradually overcame the group's sales staff's fear of trouble and established a patient and thoughtful attitude of serving customers.

    Establishing a "Shortage Registration System" and Customer Contact Book

    Once everyone understood that serving customers was a glorious and important task, they came up with many ways to improve their work. They first established a "shortage registration system." In the past, customers wanted to buy electrical wire, but the store did not have auxiliary products – tape; in this way, even the electrical wire could not be sold. Every day, many customers left disappointed because there were "no goods." They estimated that if the goods were complete, they could increase sales by at least three times a day. In this situation, everyone came up with the "shortage registration system." When customers asked about certain goods, the sales staff no longer said "no," but further asked: "Comrade, when do you need it, is it okay if it's a couple of days later?" When customers made suggestions, they recorded the variety and specifications of these goods in the register and agreed on a way to contact them later. Then, they submitted the recorded shortages to the purchasing department for procurement. In this way, in less than three months, the number of commodities managed by the group increased from 140 to 322, and the amount of sales also increased accordingly. They also established a "customer contact book" to maintain regular contact with dozens of factories, government agencies, and construction departments that needed goods. Now, 30 to 40 percent of the monthly sales are to regular customers.

    In the past, the old method of adding commodities in the Liu Shuzhen Group was to wait for the purchasing department to allocate goods. After the implementation of the shortage registration system, the purchasing became proactive. Every day, Liu Shuzhen went to the purchasing department to understand the situation of goods procurement and make requests based on customer demand and sales situation, and to pick up marketable commodities at any time. They also gradually expanded the sales scope of new commodities by means of trial sales. When the wholesale department came with a batch of white cloth belts, they first took ten rolls and sold them all; then they took fifty rolls and sold them all again; from then on, white cloth belts became a regular commodity for the group. There are many similar examples.

    Implementing Economic Accounting System and Specifying Reasonable Inventory

    The call to "improve business management and implement the economic accounting system" enabled the Liu Shuzhen Group to take another step forward in serving customers. When the store approved funds last September, some comrades in the group were afraid that a shortage of goods would affect sales and advocated increasing inventory; other comrades opposed this view. In checking inventory work, they criticized the supply system management thinking of "three no-fears" – not fearing too much stock, not fearing too many people, and not fearing a large warehouse. Subsequently, according to the normal sales volume of commodities and the possible special circumstances, according to the distance of the origin of various commodities and the length of the purchasing date, and according to the number of capital turnovers required by the higher authorities, a reasonable inventory quota was set. The total inventory of the group should not exceed fifteen days of sales at most, and at least five days. This changed the past phenomenon of "wanting more good goods, resulting in overstocking" and "taking whatever the purchasing department gives." The group's total inventory was reduced from 2.2 billion yuan to 1.077 billion yuan, and the capital turnover rate was shortened from once every 88 days in the second quarter of last year to once every 22 days in the fourth quarter.

    Learning the Card-Based Commodity Accounting Method

    While determining the inventory quota, the Liu Shuzhen Group also learned the advanced working method of the Soviet card-based commodity account. At first, some people in the group thought that "the group's commodity accounts are all consistent, so there is no need for a card-based commodity account." Therefore, a study comparing the new and old methods was carried out within the group. In the past, commodity accounts were recorded every five days, and the sales and inventory situation could not be seen in time. When selling goods, it often happened that one item had two owners or there was no goods to pay because the accounts did not match the goods. The old commodity accounts could not see the cost, the salesperson had no idea, so they blindly purchased goods and occupied too much capital. After understanding the advantages of the card-based commodity account, the comrades in the group actively learned the card-based commodity accounting method. With the card-based commodity account, everyone knows the group's "family background" and can more accurately grasp the commodity inventory quota.

    Improving Labor Organization and Improving Labor Efficiency

    A reasonable labor organization can give better play to labor efficiency. The Liu Shuzhen Group changed the past method of dividing labor according to commodities, where one person undertook tasks such as invoicing and delivering goods, and implemented a balanced assembly line operation method in which selling goods, collecting money, and delivering goods were each performed by dedicated personnel. The group leader allocated manpower according to the business proficiency of each salesperson and the busy and idle conditions of each link, eliminating the phenomenon of uneven workload. Due to the dedication of specialized personnel, it is easier to study business, and work efficiency is greatly improved. The average time required for each transaction is reduced from five minutes to two minutes and thirty seconds; the time for closing accounts after work every day is also reduced from forty-five minutes to one hour to twenty minutes to twenty-five minutes.

    Make a Good Plan, Check in Time, and Ensure the Completion of the Sales Plan

    The shortage registration system, customer contact book, and active contact with the purchasing department laid the foundation for the Liu Shuzhen Group to serve customers' needs in terms of purchasing and sales; quota management, card-based commodity accounts, and reasonable labor organization became a powerful guarantee for the Liu Shuzhen Group to transform the supply system management method, implement careful calculation, improve work efficiency, and accelerate capital turnover. In this situation, the Liu Shuzhen Group was in a position to formulate sales plans more accurately and implement them without failure. In order to ensure the realization of the plan, they checked the implementation of the plan from individuals to the whole group on a daily and ten-day basis, rewarded those who exceeded the quota in a timely manner, found lessons for those who did not complete the quota, and revised the plans that were not thorough immediately. In this way, the plans were well formulated and the inspections were timely. Since the second quarter of last year, the Liu Shuzhen Group has exceeded the sales plan every quarter and has been rewarded by the company and the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Commerce, and has won the title of "Advanced Sales Group." Recently, at the Northeast Regional Department Store System's Conference on Promoting Advanced Experience, it was decided to promote the advanced experience of the Liu Shuzhen Group throughout the entire Northeast region.

    一个国营商店的先进卖货小组
    蔡经
    沈阳市百货公司第二商店刘淑珍（五金电料）小组的营业员们，发挥了积极性，树立了正确的劳动态度，改进了工作方法，使小组工作从落后变为先进，从被动转到主动，变盲目经营为有计划经营。她们作出了国营商店基层卖货单位改进经营管理，贯彻经济核算制，准确地供应生产和消费者需要的具体榜样。
    端正为顾客服务的态度
    刘淑珍小组的营业员过去对待工作的态度是：
    “货在架子上摆着，顾客爱买就买，顾客不买，我少点麻烦！”好多顾客说营业员“像个木头人”，不愿和他们打交道。因此，小组的推销任务总是完不成。去年第二季度推销工业品运动展开了，推销任务很大，小组长刘淑珍信心不足。可是她想到：
    “工人兄弟能生产出来，难道我们就不能推销吗，再说，自己是个小组长，怎能带头叫苦？”她想到党支部书记曾说过：要完成任务，必须依靠群众、教育群众，树立为生产和人民生活需要服务的思想。她就在组内领导大家批判以姚敏为代表的不安心工作、轻视商业工作的思想与雇佣观点，展开了检查思想、检查工作的学习。当大家认识到自己工作的好坏直接影响着祖国经济建设时，信心和力量就来了。从此，他们就通过批评与自我批评，逐渐克服了小组内营业员怕麻烦的思想，树立起耐心地周到地为顾客服务的态度。
    建立“缺货登记制”、顾客联络簿
    大家明白了为顾客服务是光荣和重要的工作，便接二连三地想出了很多改进工作的办法。她们首先建立了“缺货登记制”。过去，顾客要买电线，可是商店里没有辅助品——胶布；这样，连电线也卖不出去了。每天都有许多顾客因为“没货”而失望地走了。她们估计，如果货全，每天至少可以增加卖钱额三倍。在这种情况下，大家就想出了“缺货登记制度”。当顾客问到某些商品时，营业员不再说“没有”，而是进一步问：“同志，您几时用，晚两天可以不？”顾客提出意见，她们就把这些货品的品种、规格记在登记簿上，再约定以后联系的办法。接着，她们就把登记下来的缺乏的货品提交进货部门去采购。这样，不出三个月，小组经营的商品由一百四十种增加到三百二十二种，卖钱数量也随着增多了。她们又建立了“顾客联络簿”，和几十个用货的工厂、机关和建筑部门保持着经常联系。现在每月卖货数量有百分之三十到四十是卖给老顾客的。
    刘淑珍小组过去添加商品的老办法是坐待进货方面拨货。实行了缺货登记制后，进货就主动了。刘淑珍每天根据顾客的要求和卖货情况，到进货方面去了解进货情况，提出要求，随时提取适销商品。她们又以试卖的办法来逐渐扩大新商品的推销范围。批发部来了一批白布带，她们先提取十盘，卖光了；再进五十盘，又卖光了；从此，白布带便成了小组常卖商品。像这样的例子还有很多。
    贯彻经济核算制，规定合理库存额
    “改进经营管理，贯彻经济核算制”的号召，使刘淑珍小组在为顾客服务的工作上前进了一步。去年九月商店核定资金时，小组的部分同志怕货少影响推销，主张把库存放大些；另一些同志则反对这种主张。她们在检查库存工作中，批判了那种“三不怕”——不怕货多、不怕人多、不怕仓库大的供给制经营思想。随后，按照商品的正常销售量和可能发生的特殊情况，按照各种商品产地远近和进货日期的长短，按上级要求的资金周转次数，订出合理的库存定额。全组商品库存最多不超过十五天的销售量，最少的也够推销五天。这样就转变了过去那种“好货多要，造成积压”和“进货方面给啥要啥”的现象。全组库存由二十二亿元缩减到十亿七千万元，资金周转率由去年第二季度的八十八天周转一次缩短到第四季度的二十二天周转一次。
    学习卡片商品记账法
    在确定库存定额同时，刘淑珍小组还学习了苏联的卡片商品账的先进工作方法。起初，组内有人认为“小组的货账都相符，不用什么卡片商品账”，于是，在组内展开了新旧方法对比的学习。过去五天记一次商品账，不能及时看出销、存情况，卖货时常常因账货不符而发生一货二主或无货可付的事情。过去的商品账看不出成本，营业员心中没底，就盲目进货，过多地占用了资金。组内同志在了解了卡片商品账的优点后，就积极学习卡片商品记账法。有了卡片商品账，每个人都熟知组内的“家底”，能够更正确地掌握商品库存定额。
    改进劳动组织，提高劳动效率
    合理的劳动组织可以更高地发挥劳动效率。刘淑珍小组改变了过去那种按商品分工，一个人包揽开票、付货等工作的方法，实行了卖货、收款、付货各个交易过程专人专职的平衡流水作业法。小组长按照每个营业员的业务熟练程度和各个环节的忙闲情况调配力量，消灭了忙闲不匀现象。由于专人专职，便于钻研业务，工作效率大大提高，平均每笔交易所需时间从五分钟减少到二分三十秒；每天下班后结账时间也从四十五分钟至一小时减少到二十分到二十五分钟。
    订好计划，及时检查，保证完成销售计划
    缺货登记制，顾客联络簿，和进货方面主动联系，这就使刘淑珍小组在进货、推销方面为顾客的需要服务打下了基础；定额管理，卡片商品账，合理的劳动组织，成为刘淑珍小组转变供给制经营方法，实行精打细算，提高工作效率，加速资金周转的有力保证。在这种情况下，刘淑珍小组就有条件把销售计划订得比较准确，执行起来不致落空。她们为了保证计划的实现，按日、按旬检查从个人到全组执行计划的情况，超额者及时受奖，未完成者找出教训，计划不周的马上修订。这样，计划订的好，检查又及时，从去年第二季度以来，刘淑珍小组是季季超额完成销售计划，先后受到公司和沈阳市商业局的奖励，并获得了“先进卖货小组”的称号。最近，东北区百货系统推广先进经验大会上，已决定在全东北范围内推广刘淑珍小组的先进经验。
