    Tianjin State-Owned and Local State-Owned Factories Share Experiences in Mobilizing Workers to Discuss Production Plans
    Editor's Note: Tianjin's state-owned and local state-owned factories, in the process of mobilizing workers to revise the 1953 production plan, have found ways to tap the potential of enterprises, increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. These experiences can be used as a reference for state-owned factories and mines in various regions.
    The work of revising the 1953 production plan in Tianjin's state-owned and local state-owned factories has concluded, and several important experiences have been gained in the process of revision.
    At the end of 1952, Tianjin factories compiled the 1953 production plan. The output value targets in the plans compiled by most units were higher than in 1952. However, these plans were compiled before or during the assessment work, and most had not been discussed by the masses. Therefore, they had many shortcomings. The main shortcomings were: accommodating weak links and adopting backward quotas; not adhering well to the requirements of the national plan, and still existing blindly; lacking a realistic basis and guarantees of technical organization measures. Therefore, from February to April of this year, Tianjin mobilized the masses to launch the work of revising the 1953 production plan.
    In this revision work, Tianjin's state-owned and local state-owned factories gained the following key experiences:
    First, mobilize all employees to discuss the plan around the key issues and weak links in production. In this revision work, many factories in Tianjin put a lot of effort into analyzing the reasons hindering production improvement and finding the key to promoting production, and then focused on studying how to overcome weak links. Cotton Textile Factory No. 6 adopted the method of vying for red flags on key topics under leadership. First, the leadership clearly pointed out the key problems in production in each workshop to the masses, and then mobilized the workers to offer suggestions with a specific goal. The leadership compiled the opinions of the masses into more than 1,400 topics. Because these topics came from the practical experience of the masses, the masses were willing to accept them. The masses came forward to find tricks and think of ways to solve these problems based on these topics. For example, Team C found a way to reduce the rate of substandard cloth, reducing it from nine bolts per day to 2.5 bolts. Tianjin Tap Water Company found that the key issues in production were reducing electricity and bleaching powder consumption and expanding the amount of water sold. The leadership seized these key issues, organized professional teams, guided the masses in discussions, and comprehensively revised the plan indicators. As a result, the annual water sales volume increased by 8.4%, the cost decreased by 7.2%, and the surplus increased by 14.8%. Other units, such as the paper mill, also adopted this method, grasped the key issues and solved them in depth, so they all set advanced indicators.
    Second, start with formulating an organizational and technical measures plan (what the workers call an improvement method plan) and use it as the basis for formulating the plan. Among the 39 units in Tianjin that have formulated organizational and technical measures plans, a total of 5,569 measures have been proposed. These measures have played a significant role in increasing production and saving, as well as improving product quality. Tianjin Paper Mill proposed a total of 155 technical measures. For example, the cooking workshop studied the improvement of the pulp quality and the consumption of chemical liquid in the acid cooking pot (which is one of the key factors for improving quality and reducing costs in the whole factory). Everyone put forward 32 specific methods for each process. According to preliminary estimates, this can save 5.5 billion yuan per year. The workers of the factory also adopted the method of discussing and trying out at the same time, and improved and determined the indicators based on the effect of the trial. In the discussion of the plan, they studied the problem of saving long-fiber pulp and reducing costs, and put forward the method of using cotton pulp instead of wood pulp and increasing the matching ratio. For No. 3 paper machine alone, it can save 3.8 billion yuan a year. Tianjin Cotton Textile Factories No. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 jointly proposed 832 organizational and technical measures, which can save the country more than 12.3 billion yuan, excluding the cost of the measures. The results of classifying and accounting these measures proposed by Tianjin factories according to planned indicators have reduced the cost indicators. For example, the cost indicator of Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory No. 4 was reduced by 1.7 compared with the annual plan, and that of Cotton Textile Factory No. 5 was reduced by 1.5. In Tianjin factories, where organizational and technical measures plans have been compiled, quotas and planned indicators are more advanced. For example, the result of adopting measures to compress quotas in the Rubber Accessories Factory can save more than 66,200 man-hours within a year. Zhongzhi Oil Factory improved the essential oil yield, which can increase production by 16.8 billion yuan per year.
    Third, in the revision of the plan, publicity and education work on the three major tasks of the country this year and the economic construction situation were carried out. Some bureaus and factories also combined the work of formulating the plan with the struggle against false concealment, anti-arrogance and complacency, and anti-bureaucracy. For example, Rubber Branch Factory No. 1 exposed the errors of privately lowering quality specifications and fabricating figures to falsely report achievements; People's Paper Mill Branch Factory No. 6 exposed the errors of leaving loopholes and ambushes in the plan formulation; Woolen Mill exposed the bad practice of mixing substandard products into good products. This struggle effectively combated conservative and backward thinking and capitalist management thinking, and prepared a relatively healthy ideological foundation for the revision of the plan.
    Fourth, Tianjin factories also used the experience of past plan formulation and vigorously mobilized technicians and management personnel to go deep into workshops and teams, and adopted the method of typical demonstration when formulating the plan. After the cadres of Hengda Flour Mill learned from the experience of Zhou Jiansheng's team in the flour milling department in comprehensively formulating the plan, they promoted it in various teams. As a result, the total output of the factory increased by 14.68%, and the unit man-hours decreased by 21%. The factories under the Heavy Industry Party Committee planned to mobilize technicians to go to the workshops, clearly indicating the key points and purposes of the work in advance, and providing support. Therefore, some problems related to quality, saving man-hours and raw materials were solved in units such as the Rubber Accessories Factory, the Bicycle Factory, and the Automobile Parts Factory.
    There are also some problems in Tianjin's work of mobilizing the masses to revise the plan. The main problem is that in the revision of the production plan and the organization and technical measures plan, it is not clearly and gradually combined with strengthening plan management work. Therefore, many factories still cannot carry out production evenly. The shortcomings of this revision of the plan in Tianjin are reflected in: when compiling the organizational and technical measures plan, too much emphasis is placed on technical measures with relatively long-term effects, while insufficient attention is paid to organizational measures to improve the current chaotic production management; the leadership failed to summarize and implement the tricks proposed by the masses well and in a timely manner, or supplement them into the organizational and technical measures plan. Although technicians and management personnel have gone to the workshops, they have not closely worked with the workers to jointly study and solve the current technical management and production management problems, and some have formed a simple role of going down to listen to meetings or only playing a recording role. Due to these shortcomings, the revision of the plan was not well integrated with ensuring the completion of the first quarter's tasks, and some factories still failed to complete the production plan in the first quarter. Now Tianjin is starting from a systematic inspection of the implementation of the plan, strengthening plan management, doing a good job in original records, the responsibility system, the job plan, and carrying out mass patriotic production competitions to ensure the completion of national tasks.

    天津市国营和地方国营工厂
    发动职工讨论生产计划的经验
    编者按：天津市国营和地方国营工厂在发动职工修订一九五三年度生产计划的过程中，找到了挖掘企业潜在力量、增加产量、提高质量、降低成本的途径。这些经验可供各地国营厂矿参考。
    天津市国营和地方国营工厂修订一九五三年生产计划的工作已经结束，在修订计划中取得了几点重要的经验。
    天津市各工厂在一九五二年年底曾编制了一九五三年的生产计划。多数单位编出的计划产值指标是比一九五二年提高了，但是这些计划是在查定以前或进行查定工作时编制的，多数都没有经过群众讨论，因此有不少的缺点。主要的缺点是：迁就薄弱环节和采用落后定额；没有很好地遵照国家计划的要求，还存在着盲目性；缺少现实的根据及技术组织措施的保证。因此，天津市便在今年二月到四月间，发动群众展开了修订一九五三年生产计划的工作。
    天津市国营和地方国营工厂在这次修订计划的工作中，取得下面几点主要经验：
    第一，动员全体职工围绕生产中的关键问题及薄弱环节，讨论计划。在这次修订计划的工作中，天津市许多工厂都下了很大的功夫分析妨碍生产提高的原因，寻找推动生产前进的关键，然后着重地去研究克服薄弱环节。棉纺六厂曾有领导地采取了抢课题红旗的办法，首先由领导方面给群众明确地指出各车间生产上的关键问题，然后发动职工有目标地来提意见。领导方面把群众的意见整理成了一千四百多个课题，这些课题因来自群众的实际经验，群众就乐于接受。群众纷纷根据这些课题来找窍门、想办法解决。例如丙班找出了降低次布率的办法，次布率由每天九匹减到二点五匹。天津自来水公司找出了生产中的关键问题，是降低电力和漂粉消耗以及扩大售水量。领导方面便抓住这几个关键问题，分别组织专业小组，指导群众进行讨论，全面地修订了计划指标，结果年售水量提高了百分之八点四，成本降低了百分之七点二，盈余增加了百分之十四点八。其他如造纸厂等单位也因为采取了这个办法，抓住了关键问题深入予以解决，因此都订出了先进的指标。
    第二，从制订组织技术措施计划（工人叫改进办法计划）入手，并将它作为制订计划的根据。天津市已制订组织技术措施计划的三十九个单位中，共提出措施五千五百六十九件，这些措施在增产节约及改进产品质量方面都起了很大作用。天津造纸厂共提出了一百五十五件技术措施，其中如蒸煮车间研究了酸煮锅出浆品质的提高与药液消耗问题（这是全厂提高质量、降低成本的重要关键之一），大家按每一工序提出了三十二条具体办法，据初步估计，这样全年可节约五十五亿元。该厂工人又采取了边讨论、边试行的办法，以试行的效果为基础来提高与确定指标。他们在讨论计划中，一面研究节约用长纤维浆降低成本的问题，一面提出了用棉浆代替木浆并提高配合比例的办法，仅三号纸机一年即可节约三十八亿元。天津棉纺第二、三、四、五、六厂共提出组织措施及技术措施八百三十二件，除去措施费用外，可为国家节约一百二十三亿余元。天津各厂提出的这些措施，经过按计划指标分类核算出来的结果，使成本指标降低了。如天津棉纺四厂成本指标比年计划减低了一点七，棉纺五厂的减低了一点五。天津各厂凡是编制了组织技术措施计划的，定额和计划指标都更先进了，如橡胶配件厂采用措施压缩定额的结果，一年内可节约六万六千二百多工时。中植油厂提高了精油率，每年可增产一百六十八亿元。
    第三，在修订计划中，进行了国家今年三大任务及经济建设形势的宣传教育工作，有的局、厂还结合订计划的工作，同时进行了反对虚假隐瞒、反骄傲自满、反官僚主义的斗争。如橡胶一分厂揭发了私自降低质量规格与捏造数字谎报成绩的错误；人民造纸六分厂揭发了订计划中留后手打埋伏的错误；毛织厂揭发了以次品混入好品的恶劣作法。这一斗争有力地打击了保守落后的思想和资本主义经营思想，为修订计划工作准备了较为健康的思想基础。
    第四，天津各厂还运用了过去订计划的经验，大力发动技术人员、管理人员深入车间、小组，在订计划时采取了典型示范的办法。恒大面粉总厂下车间的干部培养制粉部周建生小组全面订出计划的经验以后，在各小组推广，结果全厂总产量提高了百分之十四点六八，单位工时减少了百分之二十一。重工业党委所属各厂，有计划地发动技术人员下车间，事先明确指示工作重点和目的，并给予支持，因而在橡胶配件厂、自行车厂、汽车制配厂等单位中都解决了一些有关质量、节约工时和原料等问题。
    天津市在发动群众修订计划的工作中也有一些问题，主要是在修订生产计划和组织技术措施计划中，没有明确地和逐步加强计划管理工作相结合，因此许多厂还不能均衡地进行生产。天津市这次修订计划的缺点表现在：编制组织技术措施计划时偏重效果比较长远的技术措施，而对改进目前生产管理混乱的组织措施重视不够；对群众提出的窍门，领导方面未能很好地予以总结和及时实现，或补充入组织技术措施计划中。技术人员、管理人员虽已下车间，但是没有密切地和工人一起共同钻研解决当前技术管理和生产管理上的问题，有的形成了单纯下去听会或只起记录作用。由于这些缺点，修订计划工作与保证完成第一季度任务结合不好，第一季有部分工厂仍未完成生产计划。现在天津市正从有系统的检查计划的执行情况入手，加强计划管理，作好原始记录、责任制、作业计划等工作，开展群众性的爱国主义生产竞赛，保证完成国家任务。
