    New Victory in National Unity
    —On the Achievements of the Anti-Great Han Chauvinism Remnant Movement in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province
    Yao Dan
    It has been more than two years since the implementation of national regional autonomy in the Tibetan areas of Xikang. In November 1950, the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government, equivalent to a special commissioner's office, was established, followed by the establishment of county and district-level governments. Leading figures from minority nationalities and representatives from all walks of life actively participated in government work. Among the government committee members of the Autonomous Region People's Government and the county and district people's governments, Tibetan members accounted for 97 percent, and the main leaders of the people's governments at all levels were minority nationality cadres. This was the first time that minority nationality people enjoyed equal political rights. For more than two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the higher-level people's governments, and with the unity and active efforts of the people of all nationalities, the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang has achieved significant results in suppressing bandits, establishing political power, production, trade, supporting the troops liberating Tibet, patriotic production increase and donations, and other tasks. The broad masses of minority nationality people have also begun to live a free life. These facts demonstrate that the policy of national regional autonomy is truly the "key to solving China's national question."
    Han cadres in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang have made great efforts in helping the Tibetan people implement regional autonomy and develop production, trade, culture, education, and health. The achievements made by the Autonomous Region in these areas are also inseparable from the help of Han cadres. However, the remnants of Great Han chauvinism are still prevalent among Han cadres, and this ideological remnant has been proven to be a major obstacle to the implementation of the national regional autonomy policy. There are three situations here: First, some cadres from the old liberated areas have the problem of empiricism. They do not delve into the theories and policies concerning national issues, nor do they pay attention to investigating and studying the characteristics of minority nationalities. Instead, they often treat matters in minority nationality areas with the same methods used in Han areas. Second, many young students who have newly joined the workforce have a sense of superiority due to Great Han chauvinism, regarding everything about minority nationalities as backward and looking down upon or discriminating against them. Third, some old personnel still retain the bad idea of hostility toward minority nationalities. These ideas, manifested in work, are paternalism, coercion and commandism, distrust and impatience in helping minority nationality cadres, and a tendency toward impetuousness and rashness in individual areas, resulting in many minority nationality cadres in governments at all levels having positions without real power, limiting the enthusiasm of minority nationalities and their leading figures, and hindering the consolidation of national unity and the in-depth development of various tasks. Therefore, opposing the remnants of Great Han chauvinism among Han cadres, removing the ideological obstacles to the correct implementation of national policies, and raising the policy and ideological level of cadres have become key issues that must be promptly resolved after the implementation of regional autonomy.
    Starting from late April 1952, the Tibetan Autonomous Region, under the leadership of the CPC Kangding Prefectural Committee and taking the lead, launched a region-wide, five-month-long movement to oppose the remnants of Great Han chauvinism. The first step of the movement was to conduct ideological self-examination. Cadres at and above the county level combined self-examination with studying Comrade Li Weihan's report "Several Questions Concerning National Policies" and the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China." All Han cadres, led by leading cadres, conducted ideological self-examination in large and small meetings attended by cadres of all nationalities, using the methods of criticism and self-criticism, and linking it to their work from the perspective of policy principles. Consequently, various forms of Great Han chauvinism ideologies and work styles were widely exposed and deeply criticized. Subsequently, cadres of all nationalities launched a study of national policies. The first stage was to study the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," the "Support for the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" (People's Daily editorial), and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "Internationalism and Nationalism" and other documents. The second stage was to study the documents stipulated in the "Notice on Studying National Policies" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government. Through systematic study linked to reality, all cadres clarified the ideological boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie on national issues, and their policy and ideological level generally improved. Han cadres correctly recognized that their task was to correctly convey the Party's policies and resolutions to minority nationality cadres and patiently unite and help them implement them through democratic consultation, rather than acting as paternalistic substitutes. The demands of cadres for studying theories, policies, and investigating and researching actual situations became more urgent. Some cadres who were not at ease working in Tibetan areas also established the view of serving minority nationalities for a long time.
    Therefore, the problem of minority nationality cadres having positions without real power was also resolved accordingly. From then on, in governments at all levels, minority nationality cadres were universally respected, and Han cadres made sure to consult with minority nationality cadres democratically and report to higher levels when encountering matters. Many minority nationality cadres were promoted to leadership positions in governments at all levels. In the two or three months after the movement, more than 30 minority nationality cadres were added to various departments of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and the organization was further expanded. The current section chiefs of the Kangding County Government are all promoted from ordinary minority nationality cadres. The Kangding Trading Branch had only 20 or so minority nationality cadres for more than two years, but in the three months after the end of the movement, it newly absorbed more than 50. The CPC Kangding Prefectural Committee has called on all Han cadres to learn the languages and scripts of minority nationalities within a certain period. How to make the organizational forms and various systems of the government suitable for national characteristics and national forms under the principle of complying with national unified regulations has also become an important matter that cadres at all levels often pay attention to.
    These facts have made minority nationality cadres further realize the greatness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and the correctness of the leadership. They generally said: Han cadres have come from afar to help us, and they examine their own shortcomings in their work. We would be too sorry to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party if we do not do our own things well.
    Many minority nationality cadres have consciously examined the remnants of their narrow nationalism. They have universally established the view of "being masters of their own affairs," and their enthusiasm for work has become even higher. For example, Awang Jia Cuo, Vice Chairman and President of the Court of the Autonomous Region People's Government, has been more active than before after the movement and has personally gone to the homes of ordinary people to deeply understand the situation. Losang Gongbu, a Tibetan cadre in the Economic Department of the Autonomous Region People's Government, was not assigned a fixed job before the anti-Great Han chauvinism remnant movement, and his enthusiasm for work was not brought into play. After the movement, he was assigned to manage agricultural tools and felt that he was truly the master of his own affairs, so he became active; although he was already over forty years old, he quickly learned to write the names and numbers of various agricultural tools through hard work, and he insisted on working even when he was sick. Some county and district cadres of minority nationalities who originally lived at home also voluntarily moved to live in the government after the movement and personally went to the countryside to lead production. At the same time, they also felt more that they needed the help of Han cadres. Gongga Jiangze, the county head of Ganzi County, said: "In the past, we were afraid of not being able to be masters of our own affairs, but in the future, we are afraid of losing the help of Han cadres." The relationship between cadres of all nationalities has also become more harmonious.
    The anti-Great Han chauvinism remnant movement in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has further united the people of all nationalities and their leading figures in the entire autonomous region around Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. They feel the loveliness of the motherland even more, and they will definitely work more actively with the people of the whole country to build their great motherland.

    民族团结的新胜利
    ——记西康省藏族自治区反大民族主义残余运动的收获
    姚丹
    西康藏族地区实施民族区域自治已经两年多了。一九五零年十一月成立了相当于专署一级的藏族自治区人民政府，接着县、区两级政权也相继建立。少数民族的领袖人物和各阶层人民的代表人物都踊跃地参加了政府工作。在自治区人民政府及县、区人民政府的政府委员中，藏族委员占百分之九十七，各级人民政府的主要负责人都是少数民族干部。这是少数民族人民在政治上第一次享受到的平等权利。两年多来，西康藏族自治区在共产党和上级人民政府的领导下，在各族人民的团结和积极努力下，在清剿土匪、建政、生产、贸易和支援解放西藏部队、爱国增产捐献等项工作中，都获得了重大的成绩。广大少数民族人民也开始了自由的生活。这些事实说明，民族区域自治政策，真正是“解决中国民族问题的钥匙”。
    西康藏族自治区内的汉族干部在帮助藏族人民实行区域自治和发展生产、贸易、文教、卫生等事业曾尽了很大努力，自治区在这些方面所获得的成就也是和汉族干部的帮助分不开的。但是汉族干部中还普遍存在着大民族主义思想残余，这种思想残余已被证明是贯彻民族区域自治政策的一大障碍。这里有三种情形：一种是有些老解放区来的干部存在着经验主义的毛病，他们不大钻研关于民族问题的理论、政策，也不注重调查、研究少数民族特点，而常以对待汉族地区的一套办法来对待少数民族地区的事情。一种是许多新参加工作的青年学生，都具有大民族主义的优越感，把少数民族的一切都看成是落后的，加以轻视或歧视。一种是某些旧人员还保留着仇视少数民族的恶劣思想。这些思想在工作中表露出来的即是包办代替、强迫命令、不信任和不耐心帮助少数民族干部，以及个别地区在工作中有急躁冒进的倾向，造成各级政府中许多少数民族干部有职无权，限制了少数民族及其领袖人物积极性的发挥，妨碍了民族团结的巩固和各项工作的深入开展。因此，反对汉族干部中的大民族主义思想残余，扫除正确贯彻民族政策的思想障碍，提高干部的政策思想水平，就成为实施区域自治以后必须及时解决的一个关键问题。
    藏族自治区从一九五二年四月下旬开始，在中共康定地委的领导和带头下，展开了一个全区性的历时五个月的反大民族主义思想残余运动。运动的第一步是展开思想检查，县级以上干部结合检查，并学习了李维汉同志的“有关民族政策的若干问题”的报告和“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”。所有汉族干部都曾在领导干部带头下，在各族干部参加的大、小会议中，运用批评和自我批评的方法，联系工作，从政策原则上进行了思想检查。因而各种各样的大民族主义思想、作风，都受到了普遍的揭发和深刻的批判。接着，各族干部又展开了民族政策的学习。第一阶段是学习“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”、“拥护关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”（人民日报社论）及刘少奇同志的“国际主义与民族主义”等文件。第二阶段学习中央人民政府政务院“关于学习民族政策的通知”中所规定的文件。全体干部在联系实际的、有系统的学习中，划清了工人阶级和资产阶级在民族问题上的思想界限，政策思想水平一般都提高了一步。汉族干部正确地认识了自己的任务是将党的政策、决议正确地传达给少数民族干部，并耐心地用民主协商的方式团结和帮助他们贯彻实现，而不是包办代替。干部中对于学习理论、政策、调查研究实际情况的要求也迫切起来。有些不安心在藏族地区工作的干部，也树立起长期为少数民族服务的观点。
    因此，少数民族干部有职无权的问题也就随之得到解决。从此，在各级政府中，少数民族干部都普遍受到尊重，汉族干部都做到遇事与少数民族干部民主协商和向上级请示、报告。各级政府中并提拔了许多少数民族干部担任领导工作。运动以后的两三个月内，自治区人民政府各处增加了三十多个少数民族干部，机构也进一步扩充了。康定县政府现在的科长，都是由少数民族一般干部中提升的。康定贸易分公司两年多来只有少数民族干部二十几个，但在运动结束后的三个多月中就新吸收了五十多个。中共康定地委已号召全体汉族干部在一定时期内学会少数民族的语言、文字。如何使政府的组织形式和各种制度在遵照国家统一规定的原则下，适合民族特点和民族形式的问题，也成为各级干部经常注意的重要事情了。
    以上这些事实，使少数民族干部都进一步认识到毛主席和共产党的伟大和领导的正确。他们普遍地说：汉族干部远离家乡来帮助我们，工作中有了缺点都自己检讨，我们再不把自己的事情办好，太对不起毛主席和共产党了。
    许多少数民族干部都自觉地检讨了自己的狭隘民族主义思想残余。他们普遍树立起了“当家作主”的观点，工作积极性也更加高涨。如自治区人民政府副主席兼法院院长阿旺嘉错，在运动后比前更加积极，并曾亲自到老百姓家中深入了解情况。自治区人民政府经济处的藏族干部洛桑工布在反大民族主义残余运动以前没有被分配固定的工作，工作积极性未能发挥。运动后他被分配做管理农具的工作，感到自己真正当家作主了，便积极起来；他虽然已四十多岁，但由于刻苦学习，很快就学会了写各种农具的名字和数目字了，有时生了病也坚持工作。有些原来住在家里的少数民族的县、区干部，运动后也自动搬到政府里来住，并亲自下乡领导生产。同时，他们也更感到需要汉族干部的帮助。甘孜县长贡噶降泽说：“过去是怕不能当家作主，今后是怕失去汉族干部的帮助。”各民族干部间的关系也更加融洽了。
    西康省藏族自治区反大民族主义残余运动，已使全自治区各族人民及其领袖人物在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的周围更进一步地团结起来了。他们更加感到祖国的可爱，他们一定会更加积极地和全国人民一道来建设自己伟大的祖国。
