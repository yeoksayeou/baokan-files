    Japanese People Strive to Establish Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union
    [This Newspaper] Tokyo News: On the afternoon of April 23rd, the Japanese people held the "Japanese People's Conference for Adjusting Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union" at Hibiya Hall in Tokyo, demanding the establishment of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. The conference was convened by the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union," jointly initiated by the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-Soviet Union Friendship Association, the Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference, and the Diet Members' League for Japan-China Trade Promotion. This conference demonstrated a new development in the Japanese people's movement to strive for the establishment of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union.
    Since the "Japanese People's Peace Conference" passed a resolution in late March "demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China, and the rapid establishment of good-neighborly and friendly relations," the Japanese people have widely launched a movement to strive for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union. At the end of March, when Japan began its Diet member election campaign, the preparatory committee of the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union" put forward three guidelines and actively carried out election activities based on these guidelines. The three guidelines are: First, for candidates who strive to adjust diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union, regardless of which political party they belong to, elect them to the Diet as much as possible; second, establish a government that strives to adjust diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union; third, unite the strength of the people across the country to strive to adjust diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union. Fifty-one Diet member candidates from various parties and non-affiliated, including Karoku Hosokawa, Hachijūni Kazahaya, Sukeshige Yoshida, Yuichi Horie, Kisuke Miyakoshi, Keisuke Hoashi, Kinkazu Saionji, Yoshitaro Hirano, Masaharu Hatanaka, Hideo Yamahana, Hisao Kuroda, and Tadashi Yoshida, expressed their agreement with these three guidelines and joined the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union." Many prominent figures in society, such as Tatsuji Fuse, Kenjuro Yanagida, and Hiroshi Minami, expressed their support for this program. On April 7th, the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union" was officially established. During the election campaign, the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union" carried out various forms of publicity activities in various places. As a result of the election, thirty-six of the one hundred and thirty candidates recommended by the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union" were elected; sixteen of the fifty-one candidates who participated in the alliance were elected. In total, there are fifty-two Diet members in this Diet who are related to the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union." They will strive to form a majority of the Diet members participating in the alliance, establish a government capable of adjusting diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union, and strengthen and promote the unity of the people.
    The "Japanese People's Conference for Adjusting Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union," held on April 23rd, was based on the achievements gained in the movement to adjust diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union during the election campaign, and further called on the people across the country to rise up and strive for the establishment of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union. Three thousand people participated in the conference. The conference opened at 1:00 p.m., and Kenzō Nakajima (cultural circles), Tomitaro Kaneta (All Japan Harbor Workers' Conference), and Kisuke Miyakoshi (Chairman of the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union") were elected to form the presidium. A total of nineteen proposals were received at the conference, and each proposal was passed unanimously by the audience after heated discussions. These proposals included: assisting overseas Chinese in Japan to return to their country; promoting cultural exchanges between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union; striving for freedom of commerce and emigration; inviting representatives of the Chinese Red Cross to Japan; returning the ashes of the victims of the Hanamaki Incident and other Chinese prisoners of war; establishing a government capable of adjusting diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union, and abolishing the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement, and the Japan-Chiang Treaty; striving for a ceasefire in Korea; smashing the Japan-"South Korea" talks; restoring the freedom of Chinese People's Volunteers and Korean People's Army prisoners of war who were abused in Japan; and striving to obtain passports for representatives to attend the Chinese May Day Conference, etc.
    The conference also passed, amid warm applause from the audience: the Conference Declaration, the Questions and Demands to the Japanese Government, and the Letters to the Leaders of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States.
    The Conference Declaration stated: The time has come to establish diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union; the Yoshida government's foreign policy of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union was never the will of the Japanese people. The declaration pointed out the evils caused by the Yoshida government's subservience to the United States' foreign policy in Japan's trade, fisheries, and cultural aspects; and narrated the friendly actions of the Chinese people and the Soviet people towards the Japanese people on issues such as the Moscow International Economic Conference, the China-Japan Trade Agreement, and the return of Japanese expatriates in China. The declaration finally stated: The Japanese people can no longer tolerate this kind of unautonomous diplomacy, and in order to realize the will of peace and prosperity that the Japanese people desire, they demand the establishment of a government capable of adjusting diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union.
    In the "Questions and Demands to the Government" passed by the conference, the Yoshida government was questioned and asked about various issues related to diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union. In the letters from the conference to Chairman Mao Zedong of China and Chairman Malenkov of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, it was stated that the Japanese people earnestly hope to establish diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, and have launched a popular movement to strive for the establishment of diplomatic relations; at the same time, it expressed the belief that diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union will definitely be established. In the letter from the conference to US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, it stated that the Japanese people hope to immediately stop the Korean War and establish diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union.
    The conference read out many congratulatory and encouraging telegrams it had received.
    Finally, the audience unanimously resolved that all attendees of the conference would become activists of the "Alliance for Promoting the Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union" in order to launch a large-scale popular movement. At 4:45 p.m., the conference closed amidst the enthusiastic shouts of "Long live the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union."

    日本人民争取和中国、苏联建立邦交
     【本报讯】东京消息：四月二十三日下午，日本人民在东京市日比谷大会堂举行“日本人民调整日中、日苏邦交大会”，要求与中国、苏联建立邦交。大会是由日中友好协会、日苏亲善协会、日中贸易促进会议、日中贸易促进议员联盟所发起组织的“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”召集的。这次大会表现了日本人民争取与中国、苏联建立邦交的运动有了新的发展。
    自从三月下旬“日本人民争取和平大会”通过了“要求恢复与苏联和中国的邦交，并迅速建立善邻友好的关系”的决议以后，日本人民便广泛展开了争取建立日中、日苏邦交的运动。三月底，日本开始进行国会议员竞选时，“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”筹备会提出了三条纲领，并根据纲领积极进行竞选活动。这三条纲领是：一、对于为调整日中、日苏邦交而努力的候选人，不管他属于什么政党，尽可能把他们选到国会里去；二、建立为调整日中、日苏邦交而努力的政府；三、把全国人民的力量团结起来，争取调整日中、日苏的邦交。对这三条纲领表示同意而参加“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”的，有细川嘉六、风早八十二、吉田资治、堀江邑一、宫腰喜助、帆足计、西园寺公一、平野义太郎、畑中政春、山花秀雄、黑田寿男、吉田正等各党派及无党派的议员候选人五十一人。表示支持这个纲领的，有布施辰治、柳田谦十郎、南博等许多社会知名人士。四月七日，“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”正式宣告成立。竞选期间，“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”在各地进行了各种方式的宣传活动。大选结果，“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”推选的一百三十名候选人中，有三十六名当选；五十一个参加该同盟的候选人中，有十六名当选。总计本届国会议员中，和“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”有关联的共有五十二人。他们将努力使参加该同盟的议员形成多数派，建立能够调整日中、日苏邦交的政府，并加强和促进人民的团结。
    四月二十三日举行的“日本人民调整日中、日苏邦交大会”，是在竞选期间调整日中、日苏邦交运动中所获得的成绩的基础上，进一步号召全国人民起来争取与中国、苏联建立邦交。参加大会的有三千人。大会在下午一时开幕，推出中岛健藏（文化界）、兼田富太郎（全日本港湾工人大会）、宫腰喜助（“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”委员长）三人组成主席团。大会收到的提案共有十九件，每一提案都在热烈的讨论后，获得全场一致通过。这些提案中有：援助旅日华侨返国；促进日中、日苏的文化交流；争取通商及出国自由；邀请中国红十字会代表来日；送回花冈事件等中国被俘人员遇难者的骨灰；建立能够调整日中、日苏邦交的政府，废止旧金山和约、日美安全条约、日美行政协定及日蒋条约；争取朝鲜停战；粉碎日“韩”会谈；恢复在日本受虐待的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军被俘人员的自由；争取获得参加中国五一节大会代表的出国护照等等。
    大会并在全场热烈的掌声中通过：大会宣言、对日本政府的质问和要求书、致中苏美三大国领袖书。
    大会宣言说：和中国、苏联建立邦交，现在时机已经到来了；吉田政府敌视中、苏的外交政策，本来就不是日本人民的意志。宣言指出吉田政府屈从美国的外交政策，在日本贸易、渔业、文化各方面所造成的恶果；并叙述了在莫斯科国际经济会议、中日贸易协议、旅华日侨返国等等问题上，中国人民和苏联人民对日本人民所表示的友好行动。宣言最后表示：日本人民再不能忍受这种毫无自主性的外交了，日本人民为了实现热望和平繁荣的意志，要求建立能够调整日中、日苏邦交的政府。
    大会通过的“对政府的质问和要求书”中，就有关日中、日苏邦交的各项问题，向吉田政府提出了质询和要求。大会致中国毛泽东主席的信和苏联部长会议主席马林科夫的信中，都说明了日本人民热切希望与中国、苏联建立邦交，并已展开了争取建立邦交的人民运动；同时表示日中、日苏邦交一定能建立的信念。大会在致美国总统艾森豪威尔的信中，表明了日本人民希望立即停止朝鲜战争和建立日中、日苏邦交。
    大会宣读了收到的许多祝贺和激励的电文。
    最后，全场一致决议，当日大会的出席者全体成为“日中、日苏邦交调整促进同盟”的活动家，以展开一个大规模的人民运动。下午四时四十五分，大会在全体热烈高呼“恢复日中、日苏邦交运动万岁”的口号声中闭幕。
