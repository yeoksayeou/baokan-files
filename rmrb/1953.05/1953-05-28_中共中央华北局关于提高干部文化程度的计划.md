    The North China region, starting from 1948, has gradually established on-the-job cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools in party and government organs at and above the county level. The region has allocated cultural teachers, thus enabling cadres' cultural learning to achieve considerable results throughout the region. However, simply adopting the method of spare-time learning also has some insurmountable difficulties: (1) Generally, cadres in government organs, due to work needs, frequently go down to lower levels and come back, with high mobility, especially at the county and district levels, making it difficult to reach a certain cultural level requirement within a certain period; (2) Especially for the main cadres at the county and district levels, the work tasks are even more arduous, and relying solely on spare-time learning cannot solve the problem. Therefore, it is decided to adopt the method of assigning responsibilities at each level, drawing cadres away from their posts for full-time study in conjunction with on-the-job spare-time study, in order to complete the task of improving the cultural level of cadres. The specific plan is as follows:

    1. Establish a cadre cultural supplementary school in the North China region, responsible for drawing cadres among the prefectural committee members, county party secretaries, and county heads who have not reached the junior high school graduation level to study at the school. The school will have senior primary school classes and junior high school classes. The senior primary school class will complete studies in one year, and the junior high school class in one and a half years. There are about 1,100 such cadres in the entire region. On average, 350 people will be drawn each term, and all of them can be raised to the junior high school graduation level within five years.

    2. Inner Mongolia, each province, and each city should establish a cadre cultural supplementary school (or attach it to a party school or administrative cadre school), responsible for drawing cadres among the county committee members, general county-level cadres, district party secretaries, and district heads who have not reached the junior high school graduation level to study at the school. The classes and graduation time limits are the same as those of the North China Region Cadre Cultural Supplementary School. There are about 12,000 such cadres in the entire region. 1,800 people will be drawn each term, and about one-half of the total number of the above cadres can be raised to the junior high school graduation level within five years. The rest will still use the method of spare-time learning to improve their cultural level one step further on the existing basis.

    3. Each special district (league) and province-administered city should establish a cadre cultural supplementary primary school, responsible for drawing district committee and general district cadres to study at the school. Only senior primary school classes will be set up. There are already 30 such schools, which should be vigorously rectified, and the leadership of party and government organs over the schools should be strengthened. Those students who do not meet the conditions for cadres will be arranged for separately, and those who do not reach the junior primary school graduation level will be transferred to quick literacy classes. Those who are sick and weak and cannot persist in learning will be sent to sanatoriums or assigned work. Nurseries should be organized for those with many children. And district committee-level and general district cadres should be drawn to the school for study as soon as possible. Those teachers and staff who are not qualified should be adjusted. Each term of study is one year. There are about 82,000 such cadres in the entire region. More than 7,500 people will be drawn to enroll each year, and nearly half of the total number of the above cadres can be raised to the senior primary school graduation level within five years. The rest will still use the method of spare-time learning to improve their cultural level one step further on the existing basis.

    4. Counties that have not completed the work of eliminating illiteracy among cadres should, at an appropriate time in 1953, run quick literacy classes to raise illiterate or semi-literate cadres to the standards required for eliminating illiteracy.

    Cadre cultural supplementary schools at all levels must aim at improving the cultural level of key cadres and must start from cultivating cadres; therefore, cadres drawn for enrollment must meet the conditions, and it is opposed to treating cadre cultural supplementary schools as "shelters" for placing cadres who cannot be dealt with. Secondly, for cadres who have already been drawn to the school for study, the posts they have left behind should be immediately supplemented by drawing other cadres to avoid affecting work. Again, when drawing cadres, the reasons should be explained to the people being drawn, the handover procedures should be completed when leaving their posts, and they should study with peace of mind after entering the school.

    5. Textbook issues: The Education Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee will collect existing textbooks from various places, hand them over to the North China Cadre Cultural Supplementary School for sorting and trial use, and after the completion of the first term of middle school classes, sort out, compile, and print a set of more complete and applicable textbooks. Senior primary school textbooks will be solved by the cultural and educational departments/bureaus of various provinces and cities in the same way.

    6. Funding issues: The newly built cadre cultural schools in North China and various provinces and cities have a total of about 2,500 people (including staff), and the funds will be paid from 7% of the cadre training fee. It is estimated that the central government will allocate 7% of the cadre training fee to the localities this year, which is an increase of 2% compared with the past, and 1% can be used to solve the funding problem of the above-mentioned supplementary schools. As for the funding of cadre cultural supplementary primary schools in various special districts (leagues) and province-administered cities, it will remain unchanged as in the past, and will be paid from the worker-peasant education funds.

    After receiving this plan, each province and city should formulate a thorough and feasible implementation plan based on the specific local conditions and report it to the Organization Department and Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau by late April, one copy each.

    中共中央华北局关于提高干部文化程度的计划
    （一九五三年三月）
    华北区从一九四八年开始，陆续在县以上各级党、政机关普遍设立了在职干部业余文化补习学校，区配备了文化教员，因而使全区干部的文化学习获得不少成绩。但单纯采用业余学习的办法也有一些不可克服的困难：（一）一般机关干部，由于工作上的需要，经常下去上来，流动性大，县、区两级流动性更大，很难在一定期限内达到一定文化水平的要求；（二）特别是县、区主要干部，工作任务更为繁重，完全靠业余学习解决不了问题。因此，决定采用逐级分工负责，抽调干部离职学习与在职业余学习并行办法，以完成提高干部文化水平的任务。具体计划如下：
    一、华北区建立干部文化补习学校一座，负责抽调地委委员、县委书记、县长中不够初中毕业程度的干部入校学习。校内设高小班和初中班。高小班一年结业，初中班一年半结业。全区共有此种干部约一千一百余人，每期平均抽调三百五十人，五年内可以全部提高到初中毕业程度。
    二、内蒙古、各省、各市，各建立干部文化补习学校一座（或附设在党校、行政干部学校内），负责抽调所属县委委员、县级一般干部、区委书记、区长中不够初中毕业程度的干部入校学习。班级与结业期限与华北区干部文化补习学校同。全区共有此种干部约一万二千人，每期一千八百人，五年内可将上述干部总数的二分之一左右提高到初中毕业程度。其余仍用业余学习办法，使文化水平在现有基础上提高一步。
    三、各专区（盟）和省辖市，设立干部文化补习小学校，负责抽调区委及区一般干部入校学习。只设高小班。现已有这种学校三十所，应大力整顿，加强党、政机关对学校的领导。学员中不够干部条件者，另行设法安置，不够初小毕业水平者，转送速成识字班学习。病弱不能坚持学习者，送疗养院或分配工作。小孩多的组织托儿所。并应尽先抽调区委级及区一般干部来校学习。对教职员不称职者，进行调整。每期学习一年。全区共有此种干部约八万二千人，每年抽调七千五百多人入学，五年内可将以上干部总数的将近一半提高到高小毕业程度。其余仍用业余学习办法，使文化水平在现有基础上提高一步。
    四、凡未完成干部扫除文盲工作的县份，应于一九五三年内选择适当时机，开办速成识字班，把文盲或半文盲干部提高到扫除文盲所要求的标准。
    各级干部文化补习学校，必须以提高主要干部文化程度为目的，必须从培养干部出发；因此，抽调入学干部必须合乎条件，反对把干部文化补习学校当做安置无法处理的干部“收容所”。其次，凡已抽调入校学习的干部，其所遗职务应即抽调干部补充，以免影响工作。再次，抽调时应向被抽调的人讲清道理，离职时办好交代手续，入校后安心学习。
    五、教材问题：由华北行政委员会教育局收集各地现有教材，交华北干部文化补习学校，加以整理试用，于第一期中学班结业后，整理编印出一套较完整而适用的教材。高小教材以同样办法由各省、市文教厅、局解决。
    六、经费问题：华北与各省、市新建的干部文化学校中共约两千五百人（连同工作人员在内），经费从百分之七的干部训练费中开支。计今年中央分配给地方之干部训练费为百分之七，比过去增加了百分之二，可以百分之一解决上述补习学校的经费问题。至于各专区（盟）、省辖市的干部文化补习小学校经费，仍照过去从工农教育经费内开支不变。
    各省、市接此计划后，应根据当地具体情况，定出周密确实可行的执行计划，于四月下旬报华北局组织部、宣传部各一份。
