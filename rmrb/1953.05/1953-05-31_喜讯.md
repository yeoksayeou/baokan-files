Title: Good News

I had only been in this regiment for a few minutes when I heard a touching piece of news: the "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue" of the People's Daily on January 4th published a newsletter entitled "A Volunteer Soldier's Fiancée." The article described how Gao Guizhen, the fiancée of volunteer soldier Dong Shigui, took meticulous care of his elderly parents at his home to allow him to fight at the front with peace of mind, and how she motivated his younger sister, Yuqing, to actively participate in production and study. Later, Gao Guizhen was elected as the village branch secretary of the Communist Youth League and as a model of preferential treatment for military families at the provincial and county levels. The two exchanged letters of encouragement and proposed to launch a competition on two fronts. One of the protagonists of this story, Dong Shigui, is a cavalry messenger in this regiment. The regimental commander said with great pleasure: "From this incident, we can see the pure love and the growth of new moral qualities of our young generation."

The next day, I went to the communications unit to find Comrade Dong Shigui.

They lived in a deep valley. The spring sunshine, filtering through the tall and dense branches of the Mongolian oak trees, shone on the mountain streams where the ice and snow had melted. Beside the stream, five or six young soldiers were brushing their horses, chatting and laughing heartily as they worked. One of them, a tall, red-faced young man, laughed the loudest. He held a chestnut horse, which constantly pawed the gravel on the riverbank with its hooves, emitting bursts of long whinnies, as if sharing its master's joy.

After introductions, I learned that he was Dong Shigui. I didn't ask much about Dong Shigui's story, and everyone started to tell it. Squad Leader Cao Shulai was the first to say: "Shigui is a good comrade. Comrade Gao Guizhen's progress is inseparable from his help; however, Comrade Gao Guizhen's progress has given him great encouragement. Since they started communicating in November the year before last, Shigui has become even more active. Last year, during the rainy season, the mountain floods came, and the horses couldn't cross the river, so we all became infantry messengers. Every night, after returning from missions, our clothes were wet, our bodies were cold, and we were so tired that we fell asleep as soon as we lay down on the bed. But when we woke up, Shigui was always missing. After a long time, we would see him carrying a large bundle of green grass. He chopped the grass, filled the troughs, and sat at the entrance of the cave playing the flute. We never saw him frown or complain. Especially after the troops took over defense, the tasks were very heavy, and we often had to go out to deliver messages in the daytime, braving enemy planes and artillery fire. But every time, Shigui was the first to volunteer, and he was brave and resourceful, always completing his tasks. In February, the leader asked him to deliver an important document. As soon as he rode his horse onto a small plain, he was discovered by enemy reconnaissance planes, followed by four fighter planes. Shigui vigilantly covered the horse with a snow cloak, tapped its leg, and they both lay down on the snow. The enemy planes blindly dropped bombs twice, and seeing no movement, they shifted their target to the small mountain on the right. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Shigui jumped back on his horse and galloped towards his destination. By the time the enemy plane turned back to bomb the area for the third time, he had already run far along the riverbed."

"People can truly be called the new love of the new society!" Feng Heting抢着 said, "One is a Party member, and the other is a League member. Gao Guizhen is actively engaged in production at home, and Shigui is working hard in Korea. When he first arrived in Korea, he couldn't read a single word, making it difficult to work as a communications officer. He seized every spare moment to learn to read. Guard duty at night, feeding the horses, was a hard job, but Shigui often voluntarily took over the duty for others, and used the time to feed the horses to sit by the light and read. Sometimes it was broad daylight, and we were all up, and he was still sitting there writing!"

Then, everyone talked about the impact of Gao Guizhen and Dong Shigui's exemplary deeds among the masses. When this unit was conducting education on loving the motherland, Deputy Company Commander Mei Shaohua specifically used this vivid fact to educate the troops. Cao Shanzhi, a soldier in the first platoon, wrote a letter to his fiancée telling her about this and guaranteeing to learn from Dong Shigui, hoping that she would also actively participate in production like Gao Guizhen. Sun Jingxian, Chi Shulan, Ma Ling, and seven or eight other students from Class 2 of the Third Women's Middle School in Beijing, after seeing that article in the newspaper, specifically went to Shunyi County to慰问 Shigui's parents and Gao Guizhen. They also brought top-quality tea for Shigui's father and precious gifts such as "How to Be a Communist Party Member" and "The Biography of Liu Hulan" for Guizhen, as well as a letter from all the members of the Communist Youth League in Class 2 to Guizhen's family. After returning to school, they wrote a letter to Shigui, telling him that his family's life was very happy, asking him to fight in Korea with peace of mind, and expressing their determination to learn from their exemplary actions in defending and building the motherland and to study hard. A couple from Hami County, Xinjiang Province, far away in the border region of the motherland—Chen Rongping and Du Xuefang—also wrote letters to them, saying that their deeds had greatly moved the young men and women of Hami County, and everyone was determined to produce more wheat, grapes, and Hami melons for the motherland in 1953, and wishing Shigui to kill more enemies and make more contributions at the front. When the victory of Resist America, Aid Korea, Shigui returns home to get married, the young people of Hami County will give them a pair of very large Hami melons as a precious gift!

Dong Shigui had been blushing and smiling, intently watching the silver-white buds on the willow branches across the way. He seemed a bit embarrassed, but in the end, he said very frankly: "Of course, I am happier than anyone else. Maybe the instructor has already said that in the old society, my father was a hired laborer for his entire life, and I followed my mother begging for food at the age of seven, and we had to live on the墳頭 at night. At that time, I couldn't have imagined having today—having happiness and having honor! But, thinking of this, I also understand that if there is no leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our working people would have nothing. So, when I wrote to Guizhen, I often said: Chairman Mao gave us happiness, and we must listen to Chairman Mao in everything. Chairman Mao called for strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle and actively participating in the construction of the motherland. I am in Korea, and she is in the country, and we must do everything we can to respond to Chairman Mao's call and complete our tasks. Only in this way, will the motherland be well built, and we will have a happier life in the future."

    喜讯
    徐孔
    我来到这个团，还没有几分钟，就知道了一个动人的消息——一月四日人民日报的“抗美援朝专刊”上，登了一篇“一个志愿军战士的未婚妻”的通讯。文里说志愿军战士董世贵的未婚妻高桂珍，为了使他在前方安心打仗，如何到他家去体贴入微地照顾他年老的父母，又带动他妹妹玉卿积极参加生产和学习；后来高桂珍当选为青年团的村支部书记，又当选为省和县的优抚模范；两个人互相写信鼓励，提出在两条战线上展开竞赛。这个故事的主人公之一董世贵，就是这个团的骑兵通讯员。团长十分高兴地说：“从这件事上，可以看出我们年青
    一代的纯洁的爱情和新的道德品质的成长。”
    第二天，我到通讯部队找董世贵同志去了。
    他们住在一道很深的山谷里。春天的阳光，透过高大而稠密的青杠树的枝桠，照射到冰雪融化了的山涧里。山涧旁边，五六个年轻战士正在刷洗马匹，他们一边工作，一边纵情谈笑。其中一个赤红脸，高个的小伙子笑得最响。他牵着一匹枣红马，那马不断用蹄子扒起河边的砂砾，发出一阵一阵的长啸，好像也在分享着主人的快乐。
    经过介绍，我知道他就是董世贵。关于董世贵这段事，我没有多问，大家就抢着说起来。班长曹书来第一个说：“世贵是个好同志。高桂珍同志的进步和他的帮助是分不开的；可是高桂珍同志的进步又给了他很大鼓励。打前年十一月他俩开始通信后，世贵就更加积极了。去年雨季，山洪下来，马过河过不去，咱们都变成步兵通讯员了。每夜执行任务回来，衣服湿，身上冷，大家累得躺在床上就睡熟了。可是醒来一看，单单世贵不在，好半天，才看到他背着一大捆青草回来。他把草铡好，又添满了槽，就坐在洞口吹起笛子，从来也没见他皱过眉，叫过苦。特别是部队接防后，任务很重，常常要在白天冒着敌人飞机和炮火的封锁出去送信。可是每一回世贵都是抢在头里，又勇敢，又机灵，每次总能完成任务。二月里，首长叫他送一个重要文件，他骑上马刚跑到一个小平原上，就被敌人的侦察机发现，跟着又来了四架战斗机。世贵机警地给马披上了雪衣，一敲马腿，就一块卧在雪地上了。敌机盲目地投了两次炸弹，看见没有动静，就把目标转移到右边的小山上去了。趁着这个功夫，世贵又跳上马，向目的地飞奔而去，待敌机第三次转到那里投弹的时候，他早顺着河槽跑远了。”
    “人家真称得上是新社会的新爱情！”班长还没说完，冯鹤亭抢着说道，“一个是党员，一个是团员。高桂珍在家生产积极，世贵在朝鲜工作努力。刚入朝的时候，他一个大字不识，干通讯工作很困难，他就抓紧一切空隙时间学文化。夜里值班喂马是个苦差事，可是世贵经常主动地替别人值班，并利用喂马的空隙，坐在灯跟前看书。有时天大亮，咱们都起床了，他还坐在那里写字呢！”
    接着，大家又纷纷谈到高桂珍和董世贵的模范事迹在群众中间所产生的影响。这个单位在进行爱祖国的教育的时候，副连长梅绍华特地用这个生动的事实对部队进行了一次教育。一排战士曹善梓，把这件事写信告诉自己的未婚妻，他保证向董世贵学习，希望对方也像高桂珍那样积极生产。北京市第三女子中学高二班的孙敬贤、池淑兰、马玲等七、八个同学，在报上看到那篇文章以后，特地到顺义县去慰问世贵的父母和高桂珍。她们还给世贵的父亲带着上等茶叶、给桂珍带着“怎样做一个共产党员”、“刘胡兰小传”等珍贵礼品，还有高二班全体青年团员写给桂珍全家的信。回校后，她们又给世贵来了信，告诉他：他家里的生活很美满，叫他安心在朝鲜作战，并表示自己要学习他们在保卫祖国、建设祖国中的模范行动，努力学好自己的功课。远在祖国边疆的新疆省哈密县有一对夫妇——陈容屏和杜雪芳，也分别给他们写了信，说他们的事迹使哈密县的青年男女很受感动，大家决心在一九五三年为祖国生产更多的小麦、葡萄和哈密瓜，并祝世贵在前方多杀敌人，多立功。等抗美援朝胜利，世贵回国结婚的时候，哈密县的青年要送给他俩一对很大的哈密瓜，做为珍贵的献礼！
    董世贵一直红着脸笑着，专注地望着对过儿柳树枝桠上银白色的芽苞。看来他有些窘，但末了，他很坦率地说：“我当然比所有的人更高兴。可能指导员已经说过了，在旧社会，我父亲当了一辈子雇工，我七岁上就跟着母亲要饭，夜里还得住在坟头上。那时候我那能想到有今天——有了幸福，又有了荣誉！可是，想到这，我也就明白了，要是没有共产党和毛主席的领导，咱们劳动人民是什么也不会有的。所以我给桂珍写信的时候，经常说：毛主席给了咱们幸福，咱们一切都要听毛主席的话。毛主席号召加强抗美援朝斗争，积极参加祖国建设，我在朝鲜，她在国内，都要尽一切力量响应毛主席的号召，完成自己的任务。只有这样，祖国建设好了，咱们将来才能有更幸福的生活。”
