    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th: The People's Self-Defense Forces in a certain area of South Hamgyong Province, Korea, recently captured five airborne spies. The Korean internal affairs organs have ascertained that these spies were sent by the American Far East Command's intelligence agency to gather military intelligence on the Korean and Chinese People's forces' coastal defenses.
    According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency on the 22nd, on a certain day in April, Han In-ho, the captain of the People's Self-Defense Forces in a certain area of South Hamgyong Province, discovered a white dove. The dove circled over the village twice and then flew south. Han In-ho found this dove very suspicious and immediately gathered the self-defense team members to search. Soon, the self-defense team members found the dove's takeoff point. They continued searching forward, and as they approached the forested area near the top of the mountain, gunshots suddenly rang out from the mountain. The team members surrounded the forested area and, through the gaps in the branches, saw five people disguised as People's Army soldiers. Han In-ho shrewdly directed the self-defense team members to capture all five spies.
    These spies were carrying radios, pigeons, and weapons such as handguns, rifles, and automatic rifles. The spies confessed that they had been sent to North Korea after receiving two months of spy training in an American intelligence agency. After being airdropped from Yeongdeungpo Airport to a certain area of South Hamgyong Province, they released the pigeons they brought with them to report to the American military intelligence agency. However, just a few hours after landing, they were captured by the Korean people.

    朝鲜人民自卫队捕获美国空降特务
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜咸镜南道某地的人民自卫队在不久之前捕获了五个空降特务。朝鲜内务机关已查明，这些特务是美国远东司令部的特务机关为刺探朝中人民部队海防的军情而派来的。
    据朝中社二十二日报道：四月某日，咸镜南道某地的人民自卫队队长韩仁镐发现了一只白鸽子。这只鸽子在村子上空盘旋了两圈，就向南飞去了。韩仁镐觉得这只鸽子非常可疑，就立刻召集自卫队员进行搜索。不一会，自卫队员们找到了鸽子的起飞地点。他们继续向前搜索，到接近山顶树林地带时，山上忽然响起枪声。队员们四面包围了树林地带，从树枝的空隙间看见五个伪装成人民军的人。韩仁镐就机警地指挥自卫队员们，把五名特务全部捕获了。
    这些特务携带着电台、鸽子和手枪、步枪、自动步枪等武器。特务们供称：他们是在美国特务机关受了两个月的特务训练以后才被派到北朝鲜来的。他们从永登浦机场乘飞机空降到咸镜南道某地以后，就放出带来的鸽子，向美军特务机关报告。但在他们刚刚降陆几小时之后，就被朝鲜人民捕获了。
