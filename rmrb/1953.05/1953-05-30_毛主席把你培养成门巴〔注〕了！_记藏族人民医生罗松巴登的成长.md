    "Chairman Mao has cultivated you into a Menba [Note]!"
    —An Account of the Growth of Tibetan People's Doctor Luo Song Baden
    Wan Shixiang
    Luo Song Baden, a Tibetan youth from Garze, Xikang, has now been trained as a doctor. Luo Song Baden is twenty-two years old and possesses the steadfast and upright characteristics of Tibetan youth. He used to love fighting as a child, and still has several knife scars on his body. Before liberation, he studied at Kangding Middle School. Like many Tibetan residents, he suffered the humiliation of the Kuomintang bandit gang. He endured it and only studied for four semesters at Kangding Middle School, finally running back to Garze.

    Last year, although Luo Song Baden studied ethnic policies at the Kangding Tibetan Autonomous Region Ethnic School, he still had deep suspicions about the Han people. When he was transferred to the "Ethnic Health Cadre Training Class" run by the Central Nationalities Health Team, he thought, "You say you are training Tibetan doctors every day, but it may not be true, you probably just want us to be translators." The training class's brotherly care for the Tibetan students in teaching and life moved him very much, but he still harbored doubts about training Tibetan doctors. It was not until the group studies began that he saw some students who spoke both Han and Tibetan very well being transferred to the laboratory group; and saw that the Han team leaders and doctors were diligently learning Tibetan; and that the "division of labor and contracting" method was adopted in teaching, with each doctor being assigned to teach several students, eating and sleeping with them to provide guidance. When Luo Song Baden saw all this, he completely dispelled his doubts and resolved to study hard. However, when Tibetan people from Garze came across him in Kangding, they worried about him and said, "You won't be able to learn it! It takes more than ten years to learn medicine!" Luo Song Baden told them, "It's not like the past anymore. The people sent by Chairman Mao are teaching us like their own children. In a few years, we will be able to learn it." After more than two months of study, many students were able to master some applied medical techniques. Students in the disease prevention and control group were able to independently identify and diagnose common ailments; students in the laboratory group were able to independently perform general examinations; and students in the maternal and child health group were able to perform prenatal examinations and pregnancy diagnoses. Luo Song Baden himself also learned the knowledge of diagnosing common diseases, but he was not satisfied.

    In order to further strengthen the study of medical theory, he often read the team's professional books, and also bought theoretical books such as Best's Physiological Basis of Medical Practice, Gray's Anatomy, Experimental Diagnosis, and Venereology. Once, he wrote to the Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore to buy books, and the bookstore quickly sent the books and also wrote him an encouraging letter, filled with national friendship. Luo Song Baden not only had the confidence to improve his skills but also helped others. When the health team ran a midwifery training class in Garze, some Tibetan students lacked confidence in learning. He went to introduce his learning experience to them, told them the truth about being masters of their own affairs, and strengthened everyone's confidence in learning.

    After Luo Song Baden initially mastered some medical techniques, he began his internship. His first patient was an old Tibetan woman, Zeren Namu. He went with Team Leader Su. Team Leader Su asked him to diagnose first and guided him from the side. As a result, Luo Song Baden correctly diagnosed mastitis and wrote a prescription. After several injections, the old woman's illness was cured. The old woman was very surprised by this young Tibetan doctor and asked about his learning experience, earnestly exhorting him, "You are young, with Chairman Mao's leadership, you must study hard!" After that, Luo Song Baden always diagnosed first during each consultation, and the health team's doctors guided him from the side, prescribing treatment after confirming the diagnosis was correct. But every time he made a diagnosis, people always thought he was a translator. Therefore, every time, he had to publicize the health team's training of him. Every Tibetan who heard this would give him some encouragement. A living Buddha from the Yuke Ranch Lama Temple in Daofu County suffered from chronic bronchitis. Luo Song Baden ran seven times in a row and cured the disease. The living Buddha was greatly surprised and said, "In the past, we didn't have our own government. Now we are the masters of our own affairs and have established our own government. In the past, Tibetans didn't have Menba. Chairman Mao has cultivated you into a Menba!" His words were full of excitement and pride. The herdsmen of Yuke Ranch said to Luo Song Baden, "The veterinary disease prevention team has trained veterinarians for us, and now you have learned to treat people. We are not afraid of people and animals getting sick."

    In his work, Luo Song Baden would immediately pack his medicine bag and ride out for a consultation, whether it was day or night, as long as someone called. When the health team was working in Rongba Cha, Garze, more than ten miles away from Dajin Temple, he ran seventeen times and cured the disease of Che Dengzhu Lama, the steward of the temple. After getting out of bed, Che Dengzhu introduced to the Lamas, "This is from the Pangmeng family in Garze. He is a Tibetan doctor!" When Luo Song Baden went to see patients, he was often surrounded by many Tibetans. "Our doctor is here, our doctor is here!" Some people grabbed the horse asking for medicine, and some shouted, "Brother, brother, I want to come to you for treatment!" Luo Song Baden treated minor illnesses that he was sure of himself. For serious and complex diseases, he asked the doctors in the team to guide him. He cured many patients this way. Sometimes Luo Song Baden stayed by the patient's bedside all night, continuously injecting treatment according to the prescribed time. Once, a woman named Cong Namu from the Garze urban area came to Luo Song Baden and said that her three-year-old child, Silang Pengcuo, had fallen ill and asked him to go immediately. Luo Song Baden diagnosed acute pneumonia and, after asking the then team leader, Comrade Li Peilan, returned to Cong Namu's home that night and injected the child with medicine every four hours. Before long, the child's illness was cured. The next morning, when Cong Namu went to the health team to find Luo Song Baden, she said to the child in her arms, "Brother saved you, brother saved you!"

    In the days of treating Tibetan people, Luo Song Baden deeply felt that the Tibetan people placed great hopes on him. Countless words of encouragement stirred his young heart, making him work harder and learn more diligently.

    Now, this "Menba" of the Tibetan people has joined the Seda medical team and is working in the Seda area with full confidence.

    [Note] Menba in Tibetan means doctor.

    “毛主席把你培养成门巴〔注〕了！”
    ——记藏族人民医生罗松巴登的成长
    万世祥
    西康甘孜城的藏族青年罗松巴登，现在被培养成了医生。罗松巴登今年二十二岁，富有藏族青年那种刚毅耿直的特性。小时爱打架，现在身上还有几处刀痕。解放前在康定中学读书。他和许多藏族居民一样，受尽了国民党匪帮的侮辱。他忍气吞声在康定中学只读了四学期，最后还是跑回甘孜去了。
    去年，罗松巴登虽在康定藏族自治区民族学校学习了民族政策，可是对汉族还有很深的怀疑。当他被调到中央民族卫生大队所办的“民族卫生干部训练班”学习时，心里还在想：“你们天天说培养藏族医生，未必是真的，不过要我们作翻译罢了。”训练班在教学和生活上对藏族学员兄弟般的关照，曾使他非常感动，但对培养藏族医生仍抱怀疑态度。直到分组学习时，他看见有些汉藏话都说得很好的学员调到化验组学习了；又看到汉族队长、医生们都在用心学藏话；在教学上并采用“分工包干”办法，每个医生固定教好几个学生，吃饭睡觉都和学生在一起，以便进行辅导。罗松巴登看到了这些，才彻底消除了怀疑，下决心努力学习。但是，从甘孜来康定的藏民碰到他时，就替他担心地说：“学不会啊！学医要学十几年才学得会啊！”罗松巴登对他们说：“现在不比过去了，毛主席派来的人，像教儿女一样地教我们，要不到几年我们就可以学会的。”经过两个多月的学习，许多学员已能初步掌握一些应用的医药技术了。疾病防治组的学员已能独立鉴别和诊断普通病症；化验组的学员也能独立进行一般的检查工作；妇幼卫生组的学员也能作产前检查和妊娠诊断了。罗松巴登自己，也学会了诊断普通疾病的知识，但是他并不满足。
    为了进一步加强医学理论的学习，他经常读队里的业务书籍，还买了西氏病理学、生理解剖学、实验诊断学、梅毒学等理论书籍来读。有一次他写信到上海新华书店去买书，书店很快就把书寄来了，并且还给他写了一封鼓励的信，信里充满了民族的友爱。罗松巴登不但自己有信心提高业务，同时还帮助别人。当卫生队在甘孜办接生员训练班时，有些藏族学员缺乏学习信心，他便去给她们介绍自己学习的经验，告诉她们当家作主人的道理，坚定了大家的学习信心。
    罗松巴登在初步掌握了一些医疗技术后，就开始实习。他第一次医疗的病人是一个藏族老妈妈泽仁娜姆。他是和苏队长一同去的。苏队长叫他先诊断，自己在一旁指导。结果罗松巴登正确地诊断为乳腺炎并且开了药方。经过几次注射，老妈妈的病好了。老妈妈对这位藏族青年医生非常惊讶，询问了他的学习经过，谆谆嘱咐说：“你们年纪轻，有了毛主席的领导，要好好学习呵！”以后每次出诊，都是罗松巴登先诊断，卫生队的医生在一旁指导，认为正确后就处方治疗。但在每次诊断时，人家总认为他是翻译，因此，每次他都要把卫生队培养他的经过宣传一番。每个藏民听了，都要给他一番鼓励。道孚县鱼科牧场喇嘛寺的活佛害慢性支气管炎，罗松巴登一连跑了七次，把病给治好了。活佛大惊，说：“从前我们没有自己的政府，现在我们当家作主，建立了自己的政府。从前藏族没有门巴，毛主席把你培养成门巴了！”话里充满了兴奋和骄傲。鱼科牧场的牧民则向罗松巴登说：“兽疫防治队给我们培养了兽医，现在你又学会了医人，我们人畜都不怕害病了。”
    罗松巴登在工作中，不管白天或晚上，只要有人一喊，马上就背起药包骑马出诊了。卫生队在甘孜绒埧岔工作时，离大金寺有十多里路，他曾跑了十七次，把该寺管家车登珠喇嘛的病治好了。车登珠起床后，向喇嘛们介绍说：“这是甘孜乓孟家的人，是藏族医生啦！”罗松巴登出诊时，常常被许多藏民包围起来。“我们的医生来了，我们的医生来了！”有的人拉住马要药，有的喊：“阿哥阿哥，我要来找你看病！”罗松巴登遇着小病有把握的，就自己给治疗好了。遇着严重和复杂的病症，就请队里的医生指导他。他这样治好了许多病人。有时罗松巴登整夜地守在病人床前，按照规定时间，连续注射治疗。有一次，甘孜城区妇女葱娜姆来找罗松巴登，说她三岁的小孩四郎彭错病倒了，要他马上去。罗松巴登去诊断为急性肺炎，回队向当时的队长李佩兰同志请示后，当晚即住到葱娜姆家里，每隔四个钟头给小孩注射一次药物。没有好久孩子的病就好了。第二天早晨葱娜姆到卫生队去找罗松巴登时，向怀里抱着的小孩说：“阿哥救了你呀，阿哥救了你呀！”
    罗松巴登在给藏民治病的日子里，深深感到藏族人民都对他寄托着极大的希望。无数鼓励的话语激动着他年青的心，使他更加努力学习和工作。
    现在，这个藏族人民的“门巴”已参加色达医疗组，满怀信心地到色达区去工作了。
    〔注〕藏语门巴就是医生。
