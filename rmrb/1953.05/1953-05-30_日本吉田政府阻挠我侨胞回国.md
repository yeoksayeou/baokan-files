Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: Contrary to our side's sincere assistance in the repatriation of Japanese nationals in China, the Japanese Yoshida government has adopted an attitude of evasion and obstruction toward the issue of the return of overseas Chinese in Japan, making it impossible for our overseas Chinese compatriots' urgent desire to return to their homeland to be realized to this day.

　　At the beginning of this year, when a Japanese delegation consisting of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association came to China to discuss the issue of assisting Japanese nationals in China to return to their country, the head of the Japanese delegation, Tadatsugu Shimazu, chairman of the Japanese Red Cross Society, solemnly stated that he was willing to do his utmost to assist overseas Chinese in Japan to return to their country. At the same time, the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that in principle, it did not object to overseas Chinese in Japan taking the ships that came to China to pick up Japanese nationals back to their country. Under these circumstances, our overseas Chinese compatriots believed that their long-held desire to return to the embrace of the motherland would soon be realized. From January and February of this year, they began to prepare for their return, either resigning from their jobs, or suspending factory internships and studies, or ending their businesses, or selling their properties, and began to gather in Tokyo and Osaka to wait for ships back to their country.

　　However, from the time Japan sent ships to China to pick up the first group of Japanese nationals, the Yoshida government, on the pretext of its so-called agreement with the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan that "ships are not allowed to carry any cargo or passengers," shirked its responsibility to assist overseas Chinese in returning to their country and deliberately obstructed them. In this situation, many overseas Chinese who are preparing to return to their country are facing extreme difficulties in their lives, and there is a danger of them wandering the streets with their wives and children.

　　Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Japan are, with the support of the Japanese people and democratic organizations, arguing on just grounds to demand that the Japanese side fulfill its promise to assist overseas Chinese to return to their country. Overseas Chinese in Tokyo, Kansai, and other places have held many rallies demanding to return to their country. On May 25, more than 40 overseas Chinese representatives held a meeting in Tokyo, and after the meeting, they went to the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese Diet, and the liaison offices of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association, which handle the repatriation of Japanese nationals in China, to demand that they fulfill their promise to assist them to return to their country as soon as possible. The overseas Chinese representatives pointed out that the Yoshida government's attitude towards assisting them to return to their country is irresponsible and insincere.

　　At the same time, our overseas Chinese organizations in Japan, the "Overseas Chinese and Students Return Committee" and the "Overseas Students Return Conference," recently wrote to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, accusing the Yoshida government of unreasonably obstructing the return of our overseas Chinese in Japan, saying: "This despicable behavior of the Japanese government not only violates trust and treats the kindness that our side has shown to Japanese nationals with opposite means, but also, we believe, is another means of trampling on overseas Chinese by continuing its persecution of them." The Yoshida government's obstruction of the return of overseas Chinese in Japan has attracted great attention from relevant parties here.

### 日本吉田政府阻挠我侨胞回国

    日本吉田政府阻挠我侨胞回国
    【新华社二十九日讯】与我国方面真诚协助在华日侨归国的精神相反，日本吉田政府竟对旅日华侨回国问题采取推诿阻难的态度，使我国侨胞回国的迫切愿望至今未能实现。
    今年年初，由日本红十字会、日本和平联络委员会和日中友好协会三团体组成的日方代表团来到中国，和中国红十字会商谈协助在华日侨归国问题的时候，日方代表团团长、日本红十字会会长岛津忠承曾郑重表示愿为协助在日华侨的回国尽最大的努力。同时，吉田政府外务省也曾表示在原则上不反对在日华侨搭乘到中国接日侨的轮船回国。在这种情形之下，我国侨胞以为他们许久以来就要回到祖国怀抱的愿望很快就会实现，从今年一、二月起，就纷纷进行回国的准备，或辞去了职业，或中止了工场实习和课业，或结束了生意，或变卖了产业，开始集中东京、大阪两地候船回国。
    但是，从日本派船来中国接第一批日侨回国的时候开始，吉田政府竟借口它和台湾国民党残匪有所谓“去船不许载任何货物和旅客”的协议，推卸协助我国侨胞回国的责任，故意加以阻难。在这种情况下，许多准备回国的侨胞生活极为困难，有携妻带子流浪街头的危险。
    我国在日侨胞为要求日方实践协助华侨回国的诺言，正在日本人民和民主团体的声援下，据理力争。东京和关西等地华侨已经举行了许多次要求回国的集会。五月二十五日，华侨代表四十多人又在东京举行会议，会后并分赴吉田政府外务省、日本国会和办理在华日侨回国事务的日本红十字会、日本和平联络委员会和日中友好协会三团体的联络机构，要求早日履行协助他们回国的诺言。华侨代表们指出：在协助他们回国的问题上，吉田政府的态度是不负责任和没有诚意的。
    与此同时，我国在日本的侨民组织“华侨、留学生归国委员会”和“留日学生归国会议”最近写信给中央人民政府华侨事务委员会，控诉吉田政府阻难我国在日华侨归国的无理行为说：“日本政府这种卑劣行为，不但违背信用，以相反的手段对待我国方面施予日侨的恩义，并且，我们认为，是继续它的对华侨进行迫害的又一种蹂躏手段。”吉田政府对在日华侨返国的阻难，已引起此间有关方面的极大注意。
