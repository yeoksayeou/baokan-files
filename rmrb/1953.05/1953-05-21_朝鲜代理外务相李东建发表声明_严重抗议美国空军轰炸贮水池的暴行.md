    Korean Acting Foreign Minister Li Dongjian Issues Statement
    Severely Protesting the Atrocity of the US Air Force Bombing Reservoirs
    (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th) Li Dongjian, Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on the 19th, severely protesting the atrocity of the US military command dispatching the air force to bomb reservoirs in South Pyongan Province. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Recently, the US military command has been carrying out unprecedentedly shameless and cruel new atrocities against the peaceful residents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    On May 13th and 14th of this year, the US Air Force bombed the Jianlong Reservoir (annotated as Seokam Reservoir), which stores irrigation water for farmland in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, destroying the reservoir's dam and floodgates, causing peaceful villages and fields in Sunan County and Datong County to be flooded, plunging the residents of the area into misfortune. So far, according to the results of the investigation, more than 70 villages have been flooded, more than 800 people have been killed or are missing, and a large number of livestock and property have been washed away. At the same time, the farmland in this area—the cultivated land that more than 5,000 farmers had already sown—has suffered enormous damage. Not only that, but enemy planes also dropped a large number of time bombs to obstruct restoration and relief work, and strafed residents participating in rescue work with machine guns in low-altitude flights. From these actions, it can be seen how vicious and planned the enemy's outrageous atrocities are. On May 15th and 16th, US aircraft also indiscriminately bombed another reservoir in South Pyongan Province—the Jamu Reservoir (annotated as Jasan Reservoir) in Sunchon County. As a result of the bombing of these two reservoirs, 10,000 machibo of farmland were flooded, and many peaceful farmers were drowned. The property and livestock of the farmers suffered huge losses.
    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea specifically authorizes me to lodge a serious protest against these atrocities committed by the US military command.
    Today, when the Panmunjom armistice negotiations have resumed, and the people of the world and the peace-loving Korean people unanimously hope to end the bloodshed in Korea, this new atrocity committed by the US military command against the peaceful residents of Korea cannot but arouse the greatest indignation of the people of the world.

    朝鲜代理外务相李东建发表声明
    严重抗议美国空军轰炸贮水池的暴行
    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代理外务相李东建在十九日发表声明，严重抗议美军司令部派遣空军轰炸平安南道贮水池的暴行。声明全文如下：
    最近，美军司令部对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的和平居民进行着空前未有的无耻而残酷的新暴行。
    今年五月十三和十四两日，美空军轰炸了平安南道顺安郡贮存着农田灌溉用水的见龙贮水池
    （按即石岩贮水池），破坏了贮水池的堤坝和闸门，使顺安郡和大同郡的和平村庄与田野地带被洪水淹没，使该地区居民陷于不幸。到现在为止，据查明的结果，被淹没的村庄有七十多个，被害和失踪的有八百多人，并有大批家畜和家产被冲毁。同时，这个地区的农田——五千多农民已经播种的耕地，遭到了莫大的损害。不仅如此，敌机为了阻挠恢复工作和救济工作，还投下了大量的定时炸弹，并低空飞行，对参加救护工作的居民施行机枪扫射。从这些行为可以看出：敌人这种令人发指的暴行，是多么毒辣，并且是有计划地制造的。美国飞机在五月十五日和十六日又滥炸了平安南道的另一个贮水池——顺川郡慈母贮水池（按即慈山贮水池）。这两个贮水池被炸的结果，有一万町步的农田被淹没，许多和平农民被淹死。农民们的财产和家畜遭到巨大损失。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特授权本人，对于美军司令部所制造的这些暴行提出严重抗议。
    今天，当板门店停战谈判已经恢复、全世界人民与渴望和平的朝鲜人民一致希望结束朝鲜流血的时候，美军司令部对朝鲜和平居民所施的这种新暴行，不能不引起全世界人民的最大激愤。
