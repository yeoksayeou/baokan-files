Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th - The U.S. side has murdered four more of our captured personnel in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp. On May 9th, one prisoner of war was strangled to death by U.S. secret agents. On May 12th, one prisoner of war was thrown into a well and drowned by U.S. secret agents. On the same day, two more prisoners of war were beaten to death by U.S. secret agents. As usual, the U.S. side is attributing these atrocities to the prisoners of war themselves, attempting to shirk its own responsibility.

    美方又谋害我方被俘人员四名
    【新华社开城十五日电】美方又在巨济岛战俘营中谋害我方被俘人员四名。五月九日，有一名战俘被美方特务勒死。五月十二日，有一名战俘被美方特务投入井中淹死。同一天，又有两名战俘被美方特务殴打致死。美方照例把这些暴行都推说是战俘干的，企图推卸自己的罪责。
