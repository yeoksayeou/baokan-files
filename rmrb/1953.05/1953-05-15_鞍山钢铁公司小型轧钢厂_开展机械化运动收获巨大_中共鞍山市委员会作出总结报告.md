Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Small Steel Rolling Mill
Achieves Great Success in Mechanization Movement
Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Issues Summary Report

[Reported by this newspaper] The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Small Steel Rolling Mill in launching a mass mechanization and automation movement.

Since July of last year, the Small Steel Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of all its employees and guided by the advanced technology of Soviet experts, has launched a mass mechanization and automation movement, carrying out a series of renovations to production equipment. To date, they have successfully created 15 types of automated equipment, including: automatic steel drawing machine for heating furnaces, automatic steel flipping machine in the southern part of the rough rolling mill, automatic steel flipping machine in the northern part of the rough rolling mill, finishing rolling reversing plate, two small vertical reversing plates, double-hole reversing plate, vertical reversing plate, automatic coiling machine, automatic grinder, electrical guide plate, automatic flying shears, automatic steel pusher for cooling beds, and automatic material conveying machine; 23 equipment renovations; six advanced factory management experiences; and four important operating methods. Eleven of these have had a significant impact. For example, the reversing plate created by Zhang Mingshan increased the efficiency of finishing rolling by 40%; the automatic steel drawing machine for heating furnaces created by Lu Naitao and Wu Liangya increased the efficiency of heating furnaces by 20%; and combined with other automatic vertical reversing plates for rolling tube blanks, automatic coiling machines for cutting 9mm wire, etc., the degree of mechanization and automation in the heating, rough rolling, finishing rolling, cutting, and finishing processes has been greatly improved, overcoming imbalances in equipment, reducing the physical labor of employees, improving the working environment, and reducing occupational diseases and personal accidents. The factory's labor productivity has increased by 41.5%, creating wealth worth 260.4 billion yuan for the country in the 1952 production increase and conservation movement. The reversing plate alone can create wealth worth 52.7 billion yuan for the country annually. The total investment, however, was extremely limited. The creation of the finishing rolling reversing plate only cost 3 million yuan.

In January, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Anshan Iron and Steel Company convened the Anshan City Promotion Conference for the Mass Mechanization and Automation Movement of the Small Steel Rolling Mill and Award Ceremony, awarding 100 employees, cadres, and engineering and technical personnel of the Small Steel Rolling Mill who had made significant achievements in the movement, summarizing these experiences, and calling for their promotion. After the conference, specific organizational work was carried out. To date, according to a survey of only 22 units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's plants and mines, 1,144 suggestions for mechanization and automation have been put forward, 853 of which have been reviewed and approved for implementation, and 167 of which have been successfully tested. Some of the more important creations include: automatic return to track for concentrate ore, automatic friction brick pressing machine for refractory materials, automatic hand-fastening machine for iron ore trucks, automatic stops for medium-sized rolling mills, automatic skidding machine, automatic cooling table for steel pipes, automatic steel rope banding machine, automatic steel pushing machine for heating in the thin plate factory, reversing plate for nail making, automatic lifting platform, automatic pipe rocking machine for casting pipes, reciprocating cutting for planers, automatic belt hammer for power generation, automatic iron cutting saw, automatic ash discharging machine, automatic fire extinguishing machine for chemical industry, automatic machine for sulfuric acid distributors, etc. Anshan Iron and Steel Company's other 11 plants and mines, basic construction departments, and factories in the city are not yet included in the statistics. Currently, each plant and mine is further developing this movement in conjunction with discussions on the 1953 production plan.

The mechanization and automation movement launched by the Small Steel Rolling Mill has yielded the following experiences:

First, the mechanization and automation movement of the Small Steel Rolling Mill has pointed out a new path for the transformation of old factories and mines. In China's First Five-Year Plan, the renovation and reconstruction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is one of the key points of the country's planned economic construction. The state and Anshan City have both placed major investment, manpower, and leadership focus on basic construction departments. Under the technical guidance of Soviet experts, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction departments will build new, mechanized and automated factories and mines year by year. However, the equipment of our existing factories and mines, many of which were built in the colonial era, has many irrational phenomena in terms of both mechanical equipment and working environment, and urgently needs to be improved. However, in the context of the state's emphasis on basic construction, production departments must oppose the passive waiting attitude of simply relying on large-scale state investment to increase equipment and transfer cadres. It is necessary to advocate the creative spirit of the party, administration, Communist Youth League, and trade union of the Small Steel Rolling Mill relying on all employees, relying on the technical guidance of Soviet experts, without the need for large-scale state investment, to gradually and systematically realize the mechanization and automation of the production process according to existing conditions, in order to reduce physical labor, increase labor productivity, and improve the working environment. The initiative of the Small Steel Rolling Mill is in line with the state's technical reform policy and the basic policy of transforming existing enterprises, and it points out a direction for our constant efforts.

Second, believing in the experience, wisdom, creativity, and enthusiasm of the working class, and fully supporting rationalization proposals are prerequisites for carrying out the mechanization and automation movement. New China has opened the door for the working class to fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity, but the experience of the Small Steel Rolling Mill shows that the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class can only exert great power when they receive full support and correct leadership from the leadership. The cadres of the party, administration, Communist Youth League, and trade union of the Small Steel Rolling Mill are all promoted from workers in the factory. Although their education level is low and their work experience is not much, their attitude towards work is honest, they ask experts about things they don't understand, they rely on workers to solve difficulties, they attach great importance to workers' inventions and rationalization proposals, and they have established a strong technical leadership organization that can formulate technical organization measures plans on a monthly basis and mobilize the masses to solve key technical problems according to the principle of balanced production. They are able to work hard, study diligently, and learn from the masses in their work, so they are constantly improving themselves in their work. They have gradually been able to discover and grasp key problems in their work in a timely manner, are good at identifying correct or wrong opinions, and can even raise questions in technical matters in a timely manner, enlighten the masses, and rely on experts to find solutions. When mobilizing employees to put forward rationalization proposals, they often pay attention to breaking down employees' ideological concerns and provide assistance in all aspects when employees are conducting research; when manufacturing machinery, they provide necessary manpower, materials, time, and other convenient conditions; when successful manufacturing requires trial use, it often takes more manpower, materials, and delays production time, affecting production tasks, and the leadership provides more support. At the same time, they also often use various methods to publicize to workers: "Putting forward rationalization proposals is a great contribution to the party and the class." "To create, give whatever is needed, and give full support." In their work of supporting rationalization proposals and inventions, they promptly criticize and educate erroneous technical guidance and conservative ideas. Moreover, whenever an experiment is successful, they promptly use various methods to commend and reward it. For example, after Zhang Mingshan successfully created the reversing plate on September 14 last year, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Anshan Municipal People's Government, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a city-wide award ceremony to commend him and awarded Zhang Mingshan the honorary title of Special Labor Model of the City. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions also invited Zhang Mingshan to attend the National Day observation ceremony in the capital. These measures gave great encouragement to the city's employees. Fifteen mechanization and automation creations of the Small Steel Rolling Mill emerged after that award ceremony. Since then, the factory has promptly commended and rewarded each new invention and creation at the monthly summary and deployment work meeting and at the scene of the successful experiment. Workers regard the honor roll, honorary plaque, wearing flowers, and awarding prizes as honors given to individuals by the state and as encouragement and support for all employees.

Third, establishing a technical leadership organization with prestige among the masses, carrying out organized and planned leadership, and integrating the mechanization and automation movement with regular work according to the principle of balanced production to prevent it from being divorced from production is the main experience of the Small Steel Rolling Mill in organizing and leading the movement. This has played a decisive role in mobilizing the masses to transform the original mechanical equipment and gradually realize the mechanization and automation of the production process. The rationalization and automation group of the Small Steel Rolling Mill is composed of old technical workers with creative talents and technically advanced personnel, because only by relying on them can a technical leadership core with mass prestige be formed, can the idea of relying on the working class and the suggestions of experts be fully implemented. The experience of the Small Steel Rolling Mill shows that when the organization leading the rationalization proposals was led by people with conservative ideas and bourgeois technical views, when the workshop cadres with insufficient mass views had not yet realized the great power of the working masses, although the workers responded to the call of the leading organs and had put forward dozens or hundreds of rationalization proposals, these proposals were unreasonably shelved, greatly打击 the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees. Since the establishment of the rationalization and automation group headed by Zhang Mingshan and model technician Wu Liangya, and after widely absorbing old technical workers, technicians, and technical personnel of various trades with creative talents to participate as members, it has been stipulated that every employee can directly submit their inventions and rationalization proposals to the group. It is also stipulated that meetings are held every Tuesday afternoon to directly listen to the reports of the proposers, conduct on-the-spot review and discussion, and then the factory director makes the final decision on the handling method. Since then, obstacles have been broken through, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees and the masses have been fully exerted. The experience of the Small Steel Rolling Mill also shows that the leadership of the mechanization and automation movement must strictly follow the requirements of completing the production plan and the principle of balanced production, and enlighten the creative wisdom of the masses to carry out work in order to prevent the automation movement from being carried out in isolation and divorced from production, and ensure that the creative enthusiasm of the masses continues to grow. This is how the Small Steel Rolling Mill works. They clarified this experience, and only then did they change the passive situation before July 1952, when they did not distinguish between primary and secondary, had no idea what to do, and wanted to do everything, but did nothing well; they also prevented the practice of carrying out surprise movements and overcame the phenomenon of slackening after the heat was over. The first workshop of the factory has been mobilizing employees to put forward rationalization proposals since the production increase and conservation movement in May last year. At that time, the capacity of various equipment was unbalanced, and the leadership formulated a technical organization measures plan every month based on the principle of balanced production, focusing on key issues that needed to be resolved urgently and rationalization proposals. According to this plan, they promptly concentrated their efforts to solve key problems, promptly grasped the key suggestions put forward by the workers, and then put them forward to all employees, drawing everyone's attention and calling on everyone to assist the proposers in collective creation. If the workers did not put forward rationalization proposals, the leadership would take the initiative to put forward key technical transformation topics to the employees based on the requirements of balanced production and the technical organization measures plan, inspiring them to put forward rationalization proposals.

In order to improve the production imbalance between the heating, rough rolling, finishing rolling, cutting, and finishing processes, they first found that manual steel drawing was too slow, and seized the organization of workers and experts to research and create an automatic steel drawing machine to ensure the steel output speed. When the output of the heating furnace increased, they had to further consider how to roll quickly, especially since the rough rolling speed was slow, causing the finishing rolling to often stop and wait for materials. They also implemented the fast steel rolling method of "one, three, and five holes entering together" in the rough rolling by the Jiang Xingjia team, shortening the steel rolling speed from 17 seconds per piece to 11.5 seconds, increasing the output by 14.4%. However, a new imbalance appeared. The first process had an automatic steel drawing machine, but there was a "waiting for heat" phenomenon, and it still could not supply the rough rolling in time. The leadership then worked with Lu Naitao, an old heating worker, and technician Wu Liangya to extend the furnace body to 12 meters, renovate the internal structure of the furnace, improve the heating efficiency, and overcome the disconnection between heating and rough rolling. The production balance problem in the first and second processes was solved, but the finishing rolling in the third process lagged behind production needs. The leadership included Zhang Mingshan's suggestion to transform the finishing rolling machine and trial-produce the reversing plate in the technical organization measures plan for July. After a hard struggle, it was successfully tested in the competition to welcome National Day! This greatly encouraged the creative enthusiasm of all employees, shortened the finishing rolling time, accelerated the steel rolling speed, ensured the over-fulfillment of the annual task, and opened up a new path for the automation movement. The reversing plate can roll round steel with a diameter of 19, 22, 25, 28, and 32 mm. Soviet experts said: "The creation of the reversing plate has a world status!" "It should be valued by the people of the world!" Due to the greatly improved steel rolling capacity, the equipment of another heating furnace was also transformed; then, a double-hole reversing plate was created, allowing the rolling mill to roll two pieces of steel at the same time; in addition, automatic steel flipping, automatic flying shears, automatic coiling, and other automated equipment were created, realizing the principle of balanced production, ensuring the completion of the annual task, and laying a good foundation for the overall mechanization and automation of the factory.

Fourth, to carry out the technical reform movement of mechanization and automation, it is necessary to emphasize relying on old technical workers and technically advanced personnel, advocate collectivist creation, and implement the policy of combining labor and technology. The experience of the Small Steel Rolling Mill proves that technical reform and the promotion of advanced experience is a process of struggle between new and old ideas, and it is a process in which advanced ideas defeat backward ideas. In this process, only by overcoming outdated conservative ideas and bourgeois technical viewpoints can the policy of combining labor and technology be implemented, a mass collectivist movement can emerge, and technical reform and the promotion of advanced experience can be successful.

Old technical workers of the Small Steel Rolling Mill have played an important role in the mechanization and automation movement, because they have rich operating experience and are very familiar with the performance of the factory's mechanical equipment. For example, Zhang Mingshan is an old technical worker with 24 years of work experience. As long as he listens to the sound of steel rolling, he can point out whether there is a problem with the machinery or where there is a problem. All 15 inventions and creations of mechanization and automation in the factory were first proposed by old technical workers with more than 10 years of work experience. However, although these creations were initially proposed by one or two people, 12 of them, that is, 80% of all automation creations, were successfully achieved by the power of collective creation. They implemented the method of "one person proposes, everyone studies." In order to advocate collectivist creation, in addition to commending and rewarding individuals in a timely manner, the leadership also focused on commending and rewarding collectives. In mobilizing old technical workers, not only should special attention be paid to mobilizing old technical workers in the production workshop, but also attention should be paid to mobilizing old technical workers in the repair workshop, because they are responsible for the trial-production task of realizing all mechanization and automation suggestions. For example, Zhang Mingshan works in the spare parts class, not in the rolling class. Therefore, the Small Steel Rolling Mill established a multi-trade comprehensive group specializing in the manufacture of automated tools, ensuring the manufacture of automated tools. At the beginning of the Small Steel Rolling Mill's mobilization of old technical workers to participate in the movement, it was found that some old workers retained old habits such as "sticking to the rules," "mutual conservatism," "originality," "competing for personal credit," and "keeping secrets." However, the factory's party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League promptly conducted political and ideological education for them, overcame these old ideas, and thus formed a truly mass collectivist movement. Old workers prominently demonstrated their creative abilities in the movement. Some workers said: "Workers have two hands, and they can have anything they want." "If others can create, we are also old workers, can't we create for the country!" Currently, every old technical worker in the factory has his own creative plan. Due to the full exertion of workers' creative enthusiasm and the constant success, all engineering and technical personnel were moved. The factory leadership also attached importance to conducting patient political education for technical personnel, fully carried out criticism and self-criticism in the actual work of technical reform, corrected their blind worship of bourgeois technical theories and individualism, seized the commendation of advanced ideas of advanced figures among them, so that engineering and technical personnel from intellectual backgrounds with little operating experience more deeply recognized the great power of the working class collectivism, so that they have improved their political and ideological awareness after more than half a year of intense ideological struggle. For example, engineer Zhou Renyuan said during the period when Zhang Mingshan created the reversing plate: "The reversing plate has not been successfully tested in capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, Germany, and Japan, and Zhang Mingshan's suggestion is also afraid that it will not succeed!" Later, facts proved that his understanding was wrong, and the reversing plate was successfully created. At the city's award ceremony, he automatically requested to speak, saying: "Why did imperialism not succeed, and Anshan in the Puppet Manchukuo also did not succeed, but the workers of the Small Steel Rolling Mill have now successfully created it? There is only one answer: the working class in New China has fully exerted their creative talents. Why can Zhang Mingshan create successfully, but I am an engineer and cannot create successfully? There is also only one answer: Zhang Mingshan has the ideology of the working class, while I retain the ideology of the bourgeoisie and individualism. Facts show that engineering and technical personnel must improve their political level, learn from workers, and implement the policy of combining labor and technology in order to play a technical guiding role." After the actual education of the entire movement, engineer Zhou Renyuan and other technical personnel are now able to go deep into the masses and study the actual problems of current technical reform with the workers, and technical personnel like Wu Liangya, who are loved by the masses (now promoted to assistant engineer), have emerged. Currently, the workers believe: "The era of Anglo-American technical ideas blocking the way has passed, and the combination of labor and technology has generated great power." The defects of workers in technical theory, calculation, drawing, and the comprehensive knowledge of theory, and the defects of technical personnel in practical operating experience and familiarity with the factory's equipment can now be mutually compensated. Therefore, Soviet experts said: "Being able to combine labor and technology and exert the power of collective creation is one of the characteristics of the mechanization and automation movement of the Small Steel Rolling Mill."

Fifth, the Small Steel Rolling Mill is one of the units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various plants and mines that has done the best in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts and earnestly learning from advanced Soviet experience. They educated cadres and masses that learning from Soviet experience and implementing expert suggestions is a matter of standpoint, so the technical guidance of Soviet experts played a decisive role in the entire movement. Soviet experts often take the initiative to put forward key technical problems to them, point out the main topics and directions in which they should attract the masses to create collectively. Many major suggestions of the factory had several options when they were first put forward, and opinions differed. Many of them could not be concluded by the automation group, the factory director, and the engineers. In the end, they were affirmed only after the guidance of Soviet experts. Therefore, experts constantly strengthened and improved the confidence of the leading cadres. At the same time, not only do many successful creations have expert opinions, but many creations themselves were successful mainly because the experts' opinions were implemented, such as the export nozzle of the reversing plate, the steel pushing groove of the heating furnace, etc. Soviet experts often inspire our cadres to find ways to improve labor productivity and improve the working environment from the transformation of old mechanical equipment, often help cadres make plans and provide specific guidance to workers on the spot, use examples to criticize the outdated technical views of technical personnel, participate in research and review work with technical personnel, provide technical personnel with books on automation, and often remind cadres and workers: "The automation movement should start from completing the national plan and adhere to the principle of quality first." "We must make full use of existing equipment and carry out transformation on the basis of existing equipment." "Transformation must服从 the overall plan." "We must go the long way, not make temporary突击." "Don't be complacent because of your achievements, otherwise you won't be able to go far." "You should be happy with your achievements, but don't be proud." When new creations are discovered in other factories, the experts will visit and conduct research with the factory director and the general branch secretary. When the double-hole reversing plate was successfully tested, the expert excitedly said to the people around him: "This is the great power of the working class under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party! I wish the comrades success in full automation!" Therefore, the cadres and employees of the entire factory are very respectful of the Soviet experts. At the same time, because the factory not only has the factory director personally in charge, but also specially designated technical personnel to manage the work of implementing expert suggestions, and stipulates that experts are invited to guide the technical meeting every Tuesday, and organizes technical personnel to participate in the expert's technical lectures, the Soviet experts have played a decisive guiding role in the mechanization and automation movement of the factory.

The Small Steel Rolling Mill currently has several urgent problems to be solved:

(1) The factory still has problems in learning from the experience of Factory 53, making the work of the party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League strictly and promptly for production, and maintaining ideological consistency in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities. It needs to strengthen the study and application of the experience of Factory 53 and strive to become a model factory.

(2) In the entire automation movement, the cooperation between the factory's leading organs and the on-site work is not enough, that is, the work of the sections and shares going deep into the workshop to serve production is not enough. This is inseparable from the shortcomings of the leadership. The factory director is good at going deep into the masses, but not good at mobilizing and going deep into the masses through his own enterprise leadership organization to strengthen leadership. This shortcoming needs to be overcome.

(3) A detailed technical summary has not been made for many projects that have been successfully created. Experts suggest that several engineering and technical personnel should be assigned to write materials within a time limit, and after review, they should be printed into brochures and provided to relevant units for promotion. This suggestion needs to be implemented immediately.

(4) The reversing plate for rolling 9 mm and 12 mm steel, which is currently under research, needs to be grasped tightly, because this year's production task of this kind of steel is heavier.

(5) The factory's leading cadres should strengthen and improve their scientific and technological level in order to further lead the movement forward.

    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂
    开展机械化运动收获巨大
    中共鞍山市委员会作出总结报告
    【本报讯】中共鞍山市委总结了鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂展开机械化自动化的经验。
    鞍钢小型轧钢厂依靠全体职工的积极性、创造性，依靠苏联专家先进技术的指导，从去年七月以来，开展了群众性的机械化自动化运动，进行了一系列对生产设备的改造。到目前为止，已经创造成功的有：加热炉自动抽钢机、毛轧南部自动翻钢机、毛轧北部自动翻钢机、光轧反围盘、二小型立围盘、双孔反围盘、立反围盘、自动卷线机、自动磨床、电气导板、自动飞剪、冷床自动拨钢机、自动运料机等十五种自动化装备，二十三件设备改造，六件工厂管理的先进经验，四件重要的操作方法。其中效果较大的有十一件，例如张明山创造的反围盘，提高了光轧效率百分之四十；卢乃涛、吴良亚创造的加热炉自动抽钢机，提高加热炉效率百分之二十；加上其他轧制管胚的自动立围盘，剪断九公厘线材自动卷线机等创造，使加热、毛轧、光轧、剪断、精整等生产过程的机械化自动化程度大为提高，克服了设备的不平衡状况，减轻了职工的体力劳动，改善了作业环境，减少了职业病与人身事故。全厂劳动生产率提高百分之四十一点五，在一九五二年的增产节约运动中为国家创造了二千六百零四亿元的财富，只反围盘一项每年就可为国家创造价值五百二十七亿元的财富。而全部投资则极为有限，光轧反围盘的创造，只花了三百万元。
    中国共产党鞍山市委员会和鞍山钢铁公司在一月份召开了鞍山市推广小型轧钢厂群众性机械化自动化运动暨奖励大会，奖励了小型厂在运动中有显著成绩的职工、干部与工程技术人员共一百人，总结了这些经验，并号召推广这些经验；会后又进行了具体的组织工作。到目前为止，只根据鞍钢部分厂矿二十二个单位的调查，已提出一千一百四十四件关于机械化自动化的建议，已经过审查批准执行的有八百五十三件，已经试验成功的有一百六十七件。其中比较重要的创造有团矿自动回铁道、耐火自动磨擦压砖机、炼铁矿石车自动手拴机、中型轧钢自动挡、自动滑铁机、钢管自动冷却台、钢绳自动打棒机、薄板厂加热自动推钢机、制钉反围盘、自动升降台、铸管自动挠管机、刨床往复切削、发电自动皮带锤、自动切铁锯、自动出灰机、化工自动消火机、硫酸导流子自动机等等。鞍钢另外十一个厂矿和基本建设部门及市内各厂还没有统计在内。目前各厂矿结合讨论一九五三年生产计划，正进一步开展这一运动。
    小型轧钢厂开展的机械化自动化运动，已取得下面几点经验：一
     小型轧钢厂机械化自动化运动为改造旧厂矿指出了新的道路。在我国第一个五年计划中，鞍山钢铁公司的改造和重建工作是全国有计划经济建设的重点之一，国家与鞍山市都把主要投资、人力与领导重点放到基本建设部门。鞍钢基本建设部门在苏联专家的技术指导下，将要逐年建设新式的机械化自动化的厂矿。而我们原有厂矿的设备，很多都是在殖民地时代建设起来的，它无论在机械设备和作业环境上都存在着许多不合理的现象，迫切需要改进。但生产部门在国家以基本建设为领导重点的情况下，要进行这些改进，便必须反对那种只是依赖国家大量投资增加设备和增调干部的消极等待情绪；应该提倡小型厂党、行政、青年团、工会依靠全体职工，依靠苏联专家的技术指导，不需国家大量投资，根据现有条件逐步地有计划地实现生产过程的机械化自动化，以减轻体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，改善作业环境的创造精神，小型轧钢厂的创举是符合国家的技术改革政策和改造原有企业的基本方针的，它为我们指出了一个经常努力的方向。二相信工人阶级的经验、智慧、创造力和积极性，全力支持合理化建议，是开展机械化自动化运动的前提。新中国为工人阶级开放了充分发挥积极性和创造性的大门，但小型轧钢厂的经验说明：工人阶级的积极性和创造性，只有在得到了领导上的全力支持和正确领导的时候，才能发挥出伟大的力量。小型厂的党、行政、青年团、工会的干部都是从本厂工人中提拔起来的，他们的文化程度虽低，工作经验也不多，但是他们的工作态度老实，不懂的事就问专家，有困难就依靠工人解决，对工人的发明创造和合理化建议十分重视，并健全了强有力的技术领导组织，能够按月拟定技术组织措施计划，按照平衡生产的原则，有计划地发动群众解决技术上的关键问题。他们在工作中能够埋头苦干，努力钻研，虚心向群众学习，因此在工作中也不断提高了自己。他们已经逐渐地能够及时发现与掌握工作中的关键问题，善于识别正确的或错误的意见，就是在技术问题上也能及时提出问题，启发群众和依靠专家求得解决。在发动职工提出合理化建议的时候，经常注意打破职工的思想顾虑，并在职工进行研究的时候，给予各方面的帮助；在制造机械的时候，则给予必要的人力、材料、时间等方便条件；在制造成功需要试用的时候，常常可能要浪费更多的人力、材料和耽误生产时间，影响生产任务，领导上便给予更多的支持。同时，还经常运用多种方式向工人进行宣传：“提合理化建议，是对党对阶级的伟大贡献。”“为了创造，要什么给什么，全力支持。”他们在支持合理化建议与发明创造的工作中，对于错误的技术指导和保守思想及时地进行批判和教育。而且每逢试验成功，他们便及时地采用多种方式进行表扬奖励。例如在去年九月十四日张明山创造反围盘成功之后，中共鞍山市委、鞍山市人民政府、市总工会就召开了全市性的发奖大会，进行表扬，并授予张明山以全市特等劳动模范的光荣称号。东北总工会又邀请张明山出席参加首都国庆节观礼。这些措施给了全市职工以极大的鼓舞。小型厂的十五件机械化自动化创造都是在那次发奖大会后涌现出来的。以后，该厂对每一件新的发明创造，都及时地在每月一次总结与布置工作的会议上，在实验成功的现场进行表扬、奖励。工人们对于光荣榜、光荣牌和戴花、发奖，都认为是国家给予个人的荣誉和给予全体职工的鼓励和支持。三建立在群众中有威信的技术领导组织，进行有组织有计划的领导，使机械化自动化运动按照均衡生产的原则同经常工作结合进行，防止和生产脱节的现象，这是小型厂进行组织领导的主要经验，这对于该厂发动群众改造原有的机械设备逐渐实现生产过程的机械化自动化，起了决定性的作用。小型厂的合理化自动化小组是由有创造才能的老技术工人和思想先进的技术人员所组成的，因为只有依靠他们才能形成有群众威望的技术领导核心，才能充分贯彻依靠工人阶级的思想和充分贯彻专家建议。小型厂的经验证明：当领导合理化建议的组织，过去被具有保守思想和资产阶级的技术观点的人所领导的时候，当群众观点不足的车间干部还未认识到工人群众的伟大力量的时候，虽然工人们响应领导机关的号召，也曾提出过几十件、几百件的合理化建议，但这些建议都被无理地搁置起来，大大打击了职工的积极性和创造性。该厂自从成立了以张明山和模范技术员吴良亚为首的合理化自动化小组，广泛吸收了各种工种的有创造才能的老技术工人、技师与技术人员参加为组员之后，规定了每个职工都可以直接向该小组提出自己的发明创造与合理化建议。并规定每星期二下午召开会议直接听取建议人的报告，当场进行审查讨论，而后由厂长最后决定处理办法。从此之后，障碍突破了，职工群众的积极性与创造性得到了充分的发挥。小型厂的经验同时说明：对于机械化自动化运动的领导，必须严格地按照完成生产计划的要求和平衡生产的原则，启发群众的创造智慧进行工作，才可防止孤立地进行和生产脱节的自动化运动，保证群众的创造热情不断增涨。小型厂的工作便是这样进行的。他们明确了这一经验，才改变了一九五二年七月以前不分主次，心中无数，什么都要搞，什么都搞不好的被动局面；也防止了搞突击运动的作法，克服了热潮一过便松了劲的现象。该厂第一车间从去年五月增产节约运动时起，发动职工提合理化建议。当时各种设备能力不平衡，领导上依据平衡生产的原则，每月把急于解决的关键问题和合理化建议制订成技术组织措施计划。根据这一计划，及时地集中力量，解决关键问题，及时抓住工人提出的关键性的建议，然后向全体职工提出来，引起大家重视，号召大家协助建议人进行集体创造。如果工人没有提出合理化建议，领导上便根据平衡生产的要求和技术组织措施计划，主动向职工提出关键性的技术改造课题，启发他们提出合理化建议。
    他们为了改进加热、毛轧、光轧、剪断、精整等工序间的生产不平衡状况，首先发现了人力抽钢太慢，抓紧组织工人和专家研究创造了自动抽钢机，保证了出钢速度。加热炉的产量大了，就要进一步考虑如何快轧，特别是毛轧速度慢，使光轧经常停工待料。他们又实行了姜兴家小组的毛轧“一、三、五孔同入”的快速轧钢法，轧钢速度由每根十七秒缩短到十一点五秒，使产量提高百分之十四点四。但是，新的不平衡情况又出现了，第一道工序有了自动抽钢机，却又产生了“待热”现象，仍不能及时供给毛轧的需要。领导上便又和加热老工人卢乃涛和技术员吴良亚等研究将炉体延长到十二公尺，改造了炉内构造，提高了加热效率，克服了加热与毛轧的脱节现象。第一、二道工序生产平衡问题得到了解决，但第三道工序光轧又落后于生产需要，领导上把张明山改造光轧机试制反围盘的建议列入七月份的技术组织措施计划。经过了艰苦的斗争，在迎接国庆节的竞赛运动中试验成功了！这大大鼓舞了全体职工的创造热情，缩短了光轧时间，轧钢速度加快了，保证了超额完成全年任务，为自动化运动开辟了新的道路。反围盘可以轧制十九、二十二、二十五、二十八、三十二粍的圆钢。苏联专家说：“反围盘的创造是有世界地位的！”“应当受到世界人民的重视！”由于轧钢能力大大提高，就又改造了另外一个加热炉的设备；而后又创造了双孔反围盘，使轧钢机可以同时轧制两根钢材；此外还创造了自动翻钢，自动飞剪，自动卷线等自动化的设备，实现了平衡生产的原则，保证完成了全年任务，为全厂的全面机械化自动化打好了基础。四
    开展机械化自动化的技术改革运动，必须强调依靠老技术工人和思想先进的技术人员，提倡集体主义的创造，贯彻劳动与技术结合的方针。小型厂的经验证明：技术改革和推广先进经验是一个新旧思想的斗争过程，是先进思想战胜落后思想的过程。在这个过程中，只有克服了陈旧的保守思想与资产阶级的技术观点，才能贯彻劳动与技术结合的方针，出现群众性的集体主义的运动，使技术改革和推广先进经验得到成功。
    小型厂的老技术工人，在机械化自动化的运动中，起了重要的作用，因为他们具有丰富的操作经验，十分熟识本厂机械设备性能。例如张明山是二十四年工龄的老技术工人，他只要听一听轧钢的声音，就能够指出机械有无毛病或什么地方有了毛病。全厂十五件机械化自动化的发明创造，都是由有十年以上工龄的老技术工人首先提出来的。但这些创造虽然开始是由一两个人首先提出，而其中有十二件，即全部自动化创造的百分之八十，则是由集体创造的力量获得成功的。他们实行了“一人提出，大家研究”的方法。为了提倡集体主义的创造，领导上除了对个人及时地进行表扬奖励外，也着重进行了对集体的表扬奖励。在发动老技术工人的工作中，不仅要特别注意发动生产车间的老技术工人，而且还要注意发动修理车间的老技术工人；因为他们担负着实现一切机械化自动化建议的试制任务。例如张明山就在备品班工作，而不在压延班工作。因此，小型厂成立了一个专制自动化工具的多工种综合小组，保证了自动化工具的制造。小型厂发动老技术工人参加运动的开始阶段，发现有些老工人保留着“墨守成规”、“互相保守”、“独出心裁”、“个人争功”、“各留一手”的旧习气，但是该厂党、行政、工会、青年团及时对他们进行了政治思想教育，克服了这些旧思想，从而形成了真正群众性的集体主义的运动。老工人在运动中突出地表现了他们的创造能力。有的工人说：“工人有两只手，要什么都有。”“人家能创造出来，咱也是老工人，就不能给国家创造吗！”目前该厂的老技术工人每人都有他自己的创造打算。由于充分发挥了工人们的创造热情和经常不断获得成功，感动了全体工程技术人员，厂的领导上也重视了对技术人员进行耐心的政治教育，在技术改革的实际工作中，充分开展批评与自我批评，纠正他们盲目崇拜资产阶级技术理论和个人主义的思想，抓紧表扬其中先进人物的先进思想，使知识分子出身、操作经验不多的工程技术人员们比较深刻地认清了工人阶级集体主义的伟大力量，使他们经过这半年多激烈的思想斗争，政治思想有了提高。例如周任源工程师在张明山创造反围盘时期说：“反围盘在美、英、德、日等资本主义国家都未试验成功，张明山的建议也怕不能成功！”后来，事实证明他的认识是错误的，反围盘创造成功了。在全市的发奖大会上，他自动要求发言说：“为什么帝国主义没有成功，伪满时的鞍钢也没成功，而现在小型厂的工人就创造成功了呢？只有一个答案：工人阶级在新中国充分发挥了他们的创造才能。为什么张明山能创造成功，我是工程师不能创造成功呢？也只有一个答案：张明山是工人阶级思想，而我则保留着资产阶级的和个人主义的思想。事实说明，工程技术人员必须提高自己的政治水平，向工人学习，贯彻劳动与技术结合的方针，才能发挥技术指导作用。”经过了整个运动的实际教育，周任源工程师和其他的技术人员现在已经能够深入群众，与工人一起钻研当前技术改革的实际问题，而且出现了像吴良亚那样为群众所喜爱的技术员（现已提为助理工程师）。目前工人们都认为：“英美的技术思想挡道的时期已经过去了，劳动与技术结合发生了伟大力量。”工人们在技术理论、计算、绘图与理论的综合知识上的缺陷和技术人员在实际操作经验、熟识本厂设备方面的缺陷，已经可以互相弥补。因此苏联专家说：“能够使劳动与技术相结合，发挥集体创造的力量，是小型厂机械化自动化运动的特点之一。”五
    小型轧钢厂是鞍钢各厂矿执行苏联专家建议和认真学习苏联先进经验做得最好的单位之一。他们把学习苏联经验与贯彻专家建议当作立场问题向干部和群众进行教育，因此，苏联专家的技术指导在整个运动中起了决定性的作用。苏联专家经常主动地给他们提出技术上的关键问题，指出当前应该吸引群众去集体创作的主要课题和努力方向。该厂许多重大建议，开始提出时都有几种方案，意见分歧，其中许多是自动化小组、厂长和工程师不能做出结论的，最后都是经过苏联专家的指导才肯定下来，因此专家经常不断地坚定了和提高了领导干部们的信心。同时不仅在许多成功的创造中都有专家的意见，而且有许多创造本身主要是由于执行了专家的意见才得到成功的，例如反围盘的出口嘴子，加热炉的推钢槽等等。苏联专家经常启示我们的干部，要从改造旧的机械设备方面寻找提高劳动生产率与改善作业环境的出路，经常帮助干部们做计划和到现场对工人们做具体指导，用实例批评技术人员的陈旧的技术观点，与技术人员一起亲自参加研究、审查工作，供给技术人员有关自动化的书籍，经常提醒干部和工人：“自动化运动要从完成国家计划出发，坚持质量第一的原则。”“要充分利用现有设备，在现有设备的基础上进行改造。”“改造要服从整体计划。”“要走远路，不要临时突击。”“不要因为成绩而自满，不然你们走不了远路。”“有了成绩应该高兴，但不要骄傲。”当发现其他工厂有了新的创造时，专家则与厂长、总支书记一起去参观，进行研究工作。当双孔反围盘试用成功时，专家兴奋地向周围的人说：“这是中国共产党领导下的工人阶级的伟大力量！预祝同志们全面自动化的成功！”因此，全厂的干部和职工对于苏联专家十分崇敬，同时由于该厂不仅厂长亲自负责，而且专门指定了技术人员管理贯彻专家建议的工作，并规定了在每星期二的技术会议上约请专家指导，并组织技术人员参加了专家的技术讲座，因此苏联专家对于该厂的机械化自动化运动的成绩起了决定性的指导作用。
    小型厂目前还存在着几个急待解决的问题：
    （一）该厂在学习五三厂经验，使党、行政、工会、青年团工作严格与及时地为了生产，经常根据上级指示文件取得思想步调一致等方面，还存在着问题，需要加强对五三厂经验的学习和运用，争取成为模范厂。（二）在整个自动化运动的过程中，该厂的领导机关和现场工作配合不够，即科股工作深入车间为生产服务作得不够。这是和领导上的缺点分不开的。厂长善于深入群众，但不善于动员和通过自己的企业领导组织深入群众，以加强领导。这个缺点需要克服。（三）对于已经创造成功的许多项目，尚未做详细的技术总结。专家建议，应分配若干工程技术人员，限期写出材料，经过审查后印成小册子，供给各有关单位推广。这个建议需要立即执行。（四）正在研究中的轧制九粍与十二粍钢材的反围盘，需要抓紧进行，因为今年这种钢材的生产任务较重。（五）厂的领导干部应该加强提高自己的科学技术水平，以便进一步领导运动前进。
