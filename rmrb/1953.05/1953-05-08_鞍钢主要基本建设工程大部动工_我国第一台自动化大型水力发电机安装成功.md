    Major Basic Construction Projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company Mostly Underway
    China's First Automated Large-Scale Hydroelectric Generator Successfully Installed
    [This newspaper dispatch] Anshan Iron and Steel Company's new construction and renovation projects for 1953 are now mostly underway; the cross-year projects from 1952 are also being accelerated. Sixty thousand basic construction workers are working hard to complete this year's steel capital construction plan.
    The scale of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction projects this year is very large, with a construction area of 560,000 square meters, nearly doubling the total workload from last year. In addition to the major cross-year projects of a large rolling mill and a seamless steel pipe plant, there are also the renovation project of the thin plate rolling mill and the No. 7 blast furnace system project (including the new and renovated No. 7 blast furnace, Nos. 15 and 16 coking furnaces, a 130-ton boiler, a blower, and a scrubber), the renovation projects of the No. 1 steelmaking plant and the No. 1 primary rolling mill, and general construction projects covering 350,000 square meters. These projects are all large in scale, involve complex work types, and have extremely strict technical requirements, and they are all being constructed according to the most advanced technical standards. For example, after the renovation of the thin plate rolling mill is completed, automated production can be carried out from heating to rough rolling, precision rolling, annealing, and galvanizing. Therefore, the output of the same factory will be four times greater after the renovation, and a large number of workers can be reduced, reducing the labor intensity of employees. After the renovation of the No. 7 blast furnace is completed, its degree of automation will be further improved compared to the No. 8 blast furnace, which has already started production. In particular, the furnace bottom is thicker than the No. 8 blast furnace, and the furnace hearth diameter is also enlarged. This will not only greatly extend the life of the furnace bottom, but more importantly, the effective volume of the furnace body is 15 cubic meters larger than the No. 8 blast furnace, and it will be the largest blast furnace in the country after completion.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large-scale basic construction this year will play a significant role in accelerating the industrialization of the motherland and consolidating national defense. After the completion of the thin plate rolling mill, thin iron plates below 0.35 mm, which China has not been able to manufacture in the past, can be manufactured, and corrugated iron, which has not been produced in large quantities in the past, can also be produced in large quantities, and the current difficulty of lacking various thin iron plates in industrial construction can be overcome. After the renovation of the No. 7 blast furnace, the No. 1 steelmaking plant, and the No. 1 primary rolling mill are completed, they will greatly increase China's steel production, and enhance the material strength for accelerating national industrial construction and consolidating national defense.
    In order to successfully complete this year's heavy basic construction tasks, Anshan Iron and Steel Company made many preparations before construction began, ensuring that all projects could start early and accelerate construction. As of now, key projects such as the thin plate rolling mill, the No. 7 blast furnace, the Nos. 15 and 16 coking furnaces, and the blower have all started construction. The Blast Furnace Engineering Department has removed thousands of old refractory bricks, cooling plates, and the foundations of three blowers from the No. 7 blast furnace. The Thin Plate Engineering Department has blasted more than 3,000 cubic meters of the old factory building foundation and started pouring the foundation concrete. In addition, the renovation projects of the large rolling mill and the seamless steel pipe plant, which have been under construction since last year, are also being accelerated. In the first quarter, the entire Anshan Iron and Steel Company completed 11.56 percent of the annual basic construction plan, which is a significant improvement compared to the same period last year when only 1.5 percent of the annual plan was completed.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction work this year continues to receive the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the strong support from all parts of the country. Most of the major projects are designed by the Soviet Union according to the most advanced technical standards; its main equipment is also supplied by the Soviet Union with the world's first-class automated machines. To ensure the smooth progress of future construction, the Soviet Union has sent a large number of experts to provide technical guidance. All parts of the country are actively supporting Anshan Iron and Steel Company's construction this year. At present, more than 40 factories have signed ordering contracts with Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and many factories have signed ordering agreements with Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th [of May]. China's first automated large-scale hydroelectric generator has been successfully installed in a certain place in Northeast China in April. This is a new achievement in the power industry in the country's large-scale economic construction.
    This generator is a fully automated generator newly produced by the Soviet Union. All adjustments of voltage and power generation can be controlled by pressing a button. Although the machine is very large and complex, it can be operated freely by only two workers. From the beginning of the installation project, Soviet experts came to the site to guide, help solve complex technical problems, and personally participate in actual operations. Soviet experts made more than 470 suggestions, such as the "wheel spoke burning and embedding" project, which would have taken 21 days to complete according to past construction methods, but as a result of implementing expert suggestions, it was installed in only 24 hours. The guidance and assistance of Soviet experts ensured that the project could proceed quickly and smoothly.
    The installation project was undertaken by the Installation Engineering Team of the Northeast Twenty-First Engineering Company. Before the installation, workers and technicians conducted thorough technical learning, initially familiarized themselves with the names and properties of the parts, and conducted trial pre-installation. Thanks to the help of Soviet experts and the creative labor of the workers, the entire construction period was shortened from the original plan of six months to three months, and it was safely test-run at full load at 20:00 on April 25. The installation quality reached the advanced standards of the Soviet Union.
    This generator will soon be officially generating electricity.

    鞍钢主要基本建设工程大部动工
    我国第一台自动化大型水力发电机安装成功
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司一九五三年的新建和改建工程，现已大部动工；一九五二年的跨年度工程，也在加速进行。六万基本建设工人正为完成今年钢都建设计划而紧张地劳动着。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年的基本建设工程规模很大。建筑面积达五十六万平方公尺，工作总量比去年增加将近一倍。主要工程除了跨年度的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂两大工程外，还有薄板轧制厂改建工程，七号高炉系统工程（包括新建和改建的七号高炉、十五、十六两炼焦炉、一百三十吨锅炉及鼓风机、洗涤机等），第一制钢厂、第一初轧厂改建工程和数达三十五万平方公尺的一般建筑工程。这些工程都是规模宏大、工种繁杂、技术要求极为严格的，都是根据最先进的技术标准进行建设的。如薄板轧制厂改建成功后，从加热到荒轧、精轧、退火、镀锌，都可进行自动化生产。因此同样一个工厂，改建前后产量将相差四倍，而且可以减少大批工人，减轻职工的劳动强度。七号高炉改建成功后，它的自动化程度将比现已开始生产的八号高炉更进一步，特别是炉底比八号高炉加厚了，炉缸直径也扩大了。这样不仅使炉底的寿命大大延长，更重要的是炉体的有效容积比八号高炉加大了十五立方公尺，建成后将是全国最大的一个高炉。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年的大规模基本建设，对加速祖国工业化与巩固国防将起重大的作用。薄板轧制厂竣工后，我国一向不能制造的零点三五粍以下的铁板就可以制造，一向不能大量生产的瓦垄铁也可大量生产，目前工业建设中缺乏各种薄铁板的困难就可以克服了。七号高炉与第一制钢厂、第一初轧厂改建成功后，将大大增加我国的钢铁产量，为加速国家工业建设与巩固国防增强物质力量。
    为胜利完成今年繁重的基本建设任务，鞍山钢铁公司在开工前曾做了许多准备工作，保证了各项工程都能提早动工，加速进行建设。截至目前为止，薄板轧制厂，七号高炉，十五、十六焦炉，鼓风机等重点工程，都已动工。高炉工程处已将七号高炉的数千块旧耐火砖、冷却板及三个鼓风机的地基全部拆除。薄板工程处已爆破了三千余立方公尺的旧厂房基础，并开始浇灌基础混凝土。此外，自去年动工以来即未间断施工的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的改建工程，也在加速建设中。第一季度全鞍山钢铁公司已完成全年基本建设计划百分之十一点五六，这比去年同时期只完成全年计划百分之一点五的情况有显著的进步。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年的基本建设工作，继续受到伟大苏联的无私援助和全国各地的大力支援。几项主要工程，大部都是由苏联以最先进的技术标准设计的；其主要设备也都是由苏联供给的世界上第一流的自动化机器。为保证今后施工的顺利进行，苏联又派遣大批专家前来作技术指导。全国各地积极支援鞍钢今年的建设，目前已有四十余家工厂和鞍山钢铁公司签订了订货合同，并有许多工厂与鞍山钢铁公司订了订货协议。
    【新华社沈阳七日电】在四月份内，我国第一台自动化大型水力发电机已经在东北某地安装成功。这是国家大规模经济建设中动力工业上的新的成就。
    这个发电机是苏联最新生产的一部完全自动化的发电机。从调整电压和发电，全部都可用按电钮来控制。机器虽然很庞大、复杂，但只要两个工人操纵就可以运转自如。从安装工程开始，苏联专家就到现场指导，帮助解决复杂的技术问题，并亲自参加实际操作。苏联专家们曾提出各项建议四百七十多件，其中如“轮辐烧嵌”工程，按过去施工方法需要二十一天才能完成，但执行专家建议的结果，只用了二十四小时就安装好了。苏联专家的指导和帮助，保证了工程能迅速而顺利地进行。
    安装工程由东北第二十一工程公司安装工程队负责。在安装之前，工人和技术员们进行了充分的技术学习，初步熟悉了机件名称和性能，并试行预安装。由于苏联专家的帮助和工人们的劳动创造，整个工期由原计划六个月缩短为三个月，并在四月二十五日二十时满负荷安全试运转完毕。安装质量达到苏联的先进标准。
    这个发电机最近就要正式发电。
