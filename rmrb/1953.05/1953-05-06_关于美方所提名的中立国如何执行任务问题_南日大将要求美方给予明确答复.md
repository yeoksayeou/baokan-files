Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 5th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation of the Korean and Chinese side issued the following communique on May 5th:

    The delegations of both sides held a meeting on May 5th.

    At the meeting, our chief delegate General Nam Il first pointed out: "Our side has consistently maintained that, on the premise of sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country, both sides should agree on an Asian neutral country. At the meeting on May 4th, your side agreed to use an Asian country as a neutral country and specifically nominated Pakistan, which is a welcome action. Our side is willing to know whether your side has agreed to transport the remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to this neutral country in order to implement the six-point plan proposed by our side."

    The other side stated that it still opposes sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country, but it cannot provide any tenable reasons.

    General Nam Il then pointed out: "Whether the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should all be sent to a neutral country or stay in Korea and be accommodated by the neutral country is the first question that the delegations of both sides need to resolve currently. These are two fundamentally different actual situations, which require completely different specific arrangements. Our side has consistently maintained that the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated should be sent to a neutral country, and opposes keeping them in Korea. Our side believes that sending them to a neutral country is the most reasonable and practical method. However, your side insists on keeping them in Korea and having the neutral country take custody of them, and specifically nominated Pakistan to take custody of these prisoners of war in Korea. In that case, your side must have its own opinions on how to require this neutral country to perform its tasks. Our side would like to know: what steps are you prepared to take to remove the military control of the detaining side, so that the prisoners of war can be freed from the influence of the detaining side? How are you prepared to enable the neutral country you nominated to effectively administer the prisoners of war, which you say number in the tens of thousands? How are you prepared to maintain order and tranquility in the prisoner of war camps? Are you prepared to invite neutral countries to send armed forces to Korea to guard the prisoners of war? I hope your side will clarify these issues."

    However, the other side did not answer the obviously very important practical questions raised by General Nam Il at the May 5th meeting regarding how the neutral country specifically nominated by the other side should perform its tasks.

    General Nam Il finally stated to the other side that he hoped that the other side would give a clear answer to the questions raised by our side at the delegation's general meeting on May 6th.

    Both sides are scheduled to hold a delegation meeting at 11:00 a.m. on May 6th.

    关于美方所提名的中立国如何执行任务问题
    南日大将要求美方给予明确答复
    【新华社开城五日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月五日发表公报如下：
    双方代表团五月五日举行会议。
    会上我方首席代表南日大将首先指出：“我方一贯主张在将未被直接遣返的战俘送到一个中立国去的前提下，双方商定一个亚洲中立国家。五月四日会上，你方同意以一个亚洲国家作为中立国，并具体提名巴基斯坦，这一行动是值得欢迎的。我方愿意知道你方是否已经同意将不直接遣返的其余战俘运到这个中立国去，以实施我方建议的六条方案。”
    对方表示它仍继续反对把未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去，但却提不出任何站得住的理由。
    南日大将于是指出：“未被直接遣返的战俘究竟应该全部送到中立国去，还是留在朝鲜，由中立国予以收容，是双方代表团当前首先需要解决的问题。这是两种基本不同的实际情况，需要完全不同的具体安排。我方一贯主张将未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去，而反对将他们留在朝鲜。我方认为将他们送到中立国去是最合理、最实际的办法。但你方却主张将他们留在朝鲜，由中立国收管，并具体提名巴基斯坦在朝鲜收管这些战俘。既然如此，你方必然对于要求这个中立国如何担任其任务有其主张。我方愿意知道：你方准备采取什么步骤解除拘留一方的军事控制，使战俘脱离拘留一方的影响？你方又准备如何同时使其所提名的中立国有效地管辖据你方说有数万名之多的战俘？你方准备如何维持战俘营的秩序和平静？你方是否准备邀请中立国家派武装到朝鲜来看管战俘？希望你方对于这些问题予以澄清。”
    但对方对于南日大将所提出的对方所具体提名的中立国如何执行其任务的显然具有很大重要性的实际问题，在五日的会上未作答复。
    南日大将最后向对方表示，希望对方将在五月六日的双方代表团大会上对我方所提问题给予明确答复。
    双方定于五月六日上午十一时举行代表团大会。
