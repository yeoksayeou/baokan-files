Xinhua News Agency, May 29th. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a notice on May 26 regarding the protection of draught animals in disaster areas, pointing out that protecting draught animals should be one of the urgent tasks in disaster areas.

The notice stated that Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and other places have successively suffered from natural disasters such as cold waves and late frosts, resulting in a shortage of feed, and draught animals are weak or even dying. If disaster victims lose this important means of production, it will have a great impact on future production. In order to effectively carry out animal protection work, the affected areas should:

(1) Adopt various methods to solve the feed problem. The main methods are to organize the masses to help each other, free up labor, collect wild grass, salvage aquatic plants, and select crop stalks that can be used as feed to feed draught animals. Under the condition that the masses are willing, promote the spirit of mutual assistance, or exchange animal labor for fodder, or borrow fodder first and then return labor, or use kinship to raise animals in grass-rich areas. In particularly difficult areas, a portion of draught cattle loans should be issued in a planned manner to help farmers overcome the difficulty of lacking draught animal feed and avoid draught animals being bought and slaughtered by profiteering merchants.

(2) Draught animals in disaster areas are weak and cannot withstand the invasion of diseases. In addition to leading the masses to produce and help themselves, rural cadres must also assist animal husbandry and veterinary personnel to guide farmers to strengthen the feeding and management of draught animals, ensuring that the stalls are dry and food is plentiful, and preventing and controlling various diseases in a timely manner to prevent them from spreading; and should pay attention to protecting the safety of female animals and the development of young foals. In areas where conditions permit, the masses should be organized to breed livestock in a timely manner.

(3) On the premise of not hindering agricultural production, take advantage of the slack season to lead farmers to carry out transportation and other sideline production in a planned way, or sell labor or plows, to achieve the goal of protecting animals with animals, supporting people with animals, and ensuring both people and animals. However, attention must be paid to cherishing the physical strength of draught animals, and not overwork them, which will affect the health of draught animals and even lead to death.

    中央农业部通知保护受灾地区的耕畜
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府农业部五月二十六日在关于保护灾区耕畜的通知中指出，保护耕畜应成为灾区的紧急任务之一。
    通知中说，江苏、安徽、河南等地先后遭受寒流、晚霜等自然灾害的侵袭，致饲料缺乏，耕畜瘦弱甚至发生死亡现象。灾民如果失去这一重要的生产手段，对今后生产影响极大。为有效地进行保畜工作，各受灾地区要：
    （一）采用多样方法解决饲料问题。主要办法是组织群众互助，腾出劳力，打野草，捞水草，选择可做饲料的农作物秸秆等喂养耕畜。在群众自愿的条件下，发扬互助互济精神，或以畜工调换草料，或先借草料以后还工，或利用亲友关系到有草地区寄养。在特别困难的地方，应有计划地发放一部耕牛贷款，帮助农民克服缺少耕畜饲料的困难，避免耕畜为屠商压价购买宰杀。
    （二）灾区耕畜体质瘦弱，经不起病疫侵袭。农村干部除领导群众生产自救外，还须协助畜牧兽医人员指导农民，加强耕畜的饲养管理，做到栏干食饱，及时防治各种病疫，不使蔓延；并应加意保护母畜安全和幼驹的发育。在有条件的地区，应组织群众的母畜及时配种繁殖牲畜。
    （三）在不妨碍农业生产的条件下，利用农闲，有计划地领导农民进行运输以及其他副业生产，或卖工卖犋，达到以畜保畜、以畜养人，人畜两保的目的。但须注意爱惜耕畜体力，勿役使过度，影响耕畜健康，甚至招致死亡。
