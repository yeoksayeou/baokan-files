Xinhua News Agency, London, May 10th: Reuters reports that British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Butler, criticized the U.S.'s attitude on international trade issues in a speech at a luncheon of the French Chamber of Commerce in London on May 8th.

Butler emphasized that Western European countries are in an unequal position in trade with the United States due to the "deficit in accounts between the dollar and non-dollar world." Butler said: "We have done everything in our power to provide ways to eliminate this deficit. But so far, we have not received enough response to show that our efforts can ultimately succeed. … In resolving the dollar deficit problem, the other side of the Atlantic should try to improve its policies so that we can trade with them." Butler said that Britain is willing to make sacrifices to expand trade, but the policies implemented on the other side of the Atlantic are hindering the expansion of trade.

Butler made similar complaints when speaking in the House of Commons on May 7th.

Newspapers have reported that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held in London at the end of last year formulated a plan that stipulates the expansion of trade through the following methods: implementing partial convertibility of the pound sterling with the support of U.S. finances. However, when Eden and Butler presented this plan to Washington in March of this year, the U.S. government rejected it, and also rejected a similar plan proposed by the delegation of the so-called "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" in April of this year. The United States is trying to implement full convertibility of the pound sterling, which would make the pound sterling and the currencies of other Western European countries more dependent on the U.S. dollar.

High U.S. tariffs hinder exports from Britain, France, and other Western European countries to the United States, making it impossible for these countries to eliminate the dollar deficit in foreign payments. At the same time, these countries cannot expand trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries due to the restrictions of the U.S. Battle Act. The "Observer" on May 3rd reflected the dissatisfaction of British business circles with U.S. policies and their attempts to break free from the current situation. The "Observer" said that British business circles advocate the development of broader trade in the non-dollar zone, "which requires a major change in our own domestic economic structure and the economic structure of some countries in the sterling zone to reduce our dependence on dollar zone wheat and raw material supplies." The "Manchester Guardian" recently reported that because the United States refused to support the trade expansion plan formulated by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, the British government has suggested to major Western European countries that they send special missions to London to discuss "the issue of implementing a more liberal payment system for each country."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 9th: Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent, who recently visited the United States, said in a speech at the National Press Club on the 8th that he had discussed "defense," trade, the St. Lawrence Seaway, and other issues with Eisenhower. In his speech, he admitted: "There are also differences between us (the U.S. and Canada). Sometimes we are all very insistent and prefer to go our own way." He asked the United States to "not build high trade barriers to encourage international trade."

The "Washington Post" commented on St. Laurent's visit to the United States, saying: "Canada is dissatisfied with the U.S.'s prohibition of dairy product imports, and is also uneasy about the high tariffs stipulated by the U.S., which are apparently designed to prevent Canadian aluminum and zinc imports. On May 6th, the Canadian House of Commons unanimously passed a resolution requiring St. Laurent to insist on abolishing U.S. restrictions on agricultural product imports. This is to support the mission of the Prime Minister, who is currently in the United States, on these issues. However, the U.S. government is currently trying to please some Republican congressmen who firmly advocate the establishment of high tariffs. It will be difficult to obtain any satisfaction from the U.S. government on this measure."

    英国和加拿大不满美国限制贸易的政策
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十日讯：英国财政大臣巴特勒五月八日在伦敦法国商会午餐时，发言批评美国在国际贸易问题上所采取的态度。
    巴特勒强调指出，由于“美元和非美元世界之间账目上的赤字”，西欧国家在对美国贸易上处于不平等的地位。巴特勒说：“我们曾尽我们的一切力量提供办法，来消灭这种赤字。可是到现在我们还没有得到足够的反应可以看出我们的努力最后能够成功。……在解决美元赤字问题上，大西洋彼岸应该设法改进自己的政策，使我们可以跟他们进行贸易。”巴特勒说，英国愿意为了扩大贸易而有所牺牲，但是大西洋彼岸所实行的政策却妨碍着贸易的扩大。
    巴特勒五月七日在下院发言时也作了同样的抱怨。
    报纸已经报道过，去年末在伦敦举行的英联邦总理会议曾制订一项计划，规定用下列办法来扩大贸易，就是在美国财政的支持下，实行英镑的部分兑换。但是当今年三月艾登和巴特勒到美国把这个计划向华盛顿提出时，美国政府竟加以拒绝，同时也拒绝了所谓“欧洲经济合作局”的代表团今年四月提出的类似计划。美国力图实行英镑的完全兑换，这样就会使英镑和其他西欧国家的货币更加依赖美元。
    美国的高额税率妨碍着英国、法国和其他西欧国家对美国的输出，这就使上述国家没有可能在对外支付上消灭美元赤字。同时这些国家由于美国巴特尔法的限制，不能与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家扩展贸易。五月三日的“观察家报”反映了英国商界对美国的政策的不满和他们想摆脱目前处境的企图。“观察家报”说，英国商界主张发展比较广泛的非美元区的贸易，“这就要求大大改变我们自己的国内经济结构和英镑区的一些国家的经济结构，以减少我们对美元区小麦和原料供应的依赖。”“曼彻斯特卫报”最近报道，英国政府由于美国拒绝支持英联邦总理会议制订的扩大贸易计划，已向主要的西欧国家建议派遣特别使团到伦敦，讨论“关于对每个国家实行比较自由的支付制度”的问题。
     【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿九日讯：最近访问美国的加拿大总理圣劳伦八日曾在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表谈话，他说曾和艾森豪威尔讨论了“防御”、贸易，圣罗棱士河航运等等问题。他在谈话中承认：“我们（美加）之间也是有分歧的，我们有时大家都十分坚持，宁愿各走各的路。”他要求美国“不要高筑贸易壁垒，以鼓励国际贸易”。
    “华盛顿邮报”在评论圣劳伦访美时，说：“加拿大对美国不准牛乳制品进口表示不满，同时对美国规定的显然是用来阻止加拿大的铝和锌入口的高额关税感到不安。五月六日加拿大众院一致通过一项决议，要圣劳伦坚持废除美国对农产品入口的限制，这是为了在这些问题上支持正在美国的总理的使命的。但是，美国政府目前正企图讨好共和党一部分坚主建立高额关税的议员，这一措施很难从美国政府方面得到任何满足。”
