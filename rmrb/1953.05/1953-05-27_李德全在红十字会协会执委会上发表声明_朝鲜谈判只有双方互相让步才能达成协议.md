Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th (Delayed Dispatch) The Executive Committee of the Red Cross Association held a meeting in Geneva from May 19th to 22nd, and unanimously passed a proposal put forward by the Chinese Red Cross Society, requesting the rapid implementation of the Korean armistice. The resolution calls on the negotiating parties in Korea to quickly resolve the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war on a reasonable basis, in the spirit of consultation and with the sincerity of seeking agreement, in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Conventions, thereby realizing the Korean armistice and peace in the Far East.

Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, in a statement accompanying the proposal, said, when talking about the many complex issues related to the Korean armistice that had been resolved and the 63 clauses of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement that the two sides had already reached agreement on: The remaining outstanding issue—the issue of prisoner of war repatriation—should not be an issue, because Article 118 of the Geneva Convention specifically stipulates that prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after the cessation of actual hostilities without delay. At the same time, the two sides have already reached an agreement on the clauses regarding the arrangements for prisoners of war in the draft armistice agreement.

The statement continued: The two proposals put forward by the Korean-Chinese side on April 26th and May 7th provide a solution to this unresolved problem. These two proposals are fair, reasonable, and feasible. However, the armistice is not a unilateral matter; an agreement can only be reached when both sides have the sincerity to cease hostilities and make mutual concessions.

The statement emphasized: At this critical juncture in the development of the Korean situation, the members of the Red Cross Association should take advantage of the opportunity provided by the resumption of negotiations and continue to strive for mutual consultation between the two sides to achieve an armistice based on the principles of upholding the dignity and spirit of the Geneva Conventions. National Red Cross Societies should take action to promote the interests of mankind and humanitarian principles.

At the closing meeting, the Executive Committee also unanimously adopted a resolution based on the proposal of Dr. Boris Patchkov, the Soviet representative, requesting both parties to immediately cease "all hostilities in Korea during a period agreed upon by both parties" "in order to conduct the current armistice negotiations in the best possible environment."

Dr. Patchkov, Vice Chairman of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union, in his original proposal, requested the cessation of bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea. After the British and Canadian representatives proposed amendments and the Soviet representative agreed, this resolution was adopted in its current form. After the meeting unanimously passed this resolution, Dr. Patchkov spoke, requesting that this resolution be immediately sent to the warring parties in Korea.

Prior to this, Li Dequan had issued a statement explaining how the Chinese Red Cross Society helped Japanese nationals in China realize their desire to return to their country. She emphasized the good treatment that Japanese nationals in China received before returning to their country, the preferential measures and enthusiastic assistance taken by the Chinese people to facilitate their return, and the gratitude expressed by the returning Japanese people. Li Dequan said: "The satisfactory result of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the three relevant Japanese people's organizations discussing the issue of assisting Japanese nationals in China to return to their country proves that a great contribution can be made to promoting friendship between people all over the world through consultation."

Emile Sandström of Sweden, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Red Cross Association, expressed his satisfaction with the return of Japanese nationals in his opening speech to the Executive Committee. During the break in the meeting, he personally paid tribute to the Chinese representative for the contribution made by the Chinese Red Cross Society in making this work possible. When discussing the issue of relieving victims of natural disasters, the representatives of Britain and India expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people for donating money to the people of their two countries.

The next meeting of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross Association will be held in Geneva from November 30th to December 5th.

The delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society arrived in Prague from Geneva on the 24th and left here for home on the morning of the 25th.

    李德全在红十字会协会执委会上发表声明
    朝鲜谈判只有双方互相让步才能达成协议
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】（迟到）红十字会协会执行委员会从五月十九日到二十二日在日内瓦举行会议，一致通过了中国红十字会提出的一项提案，要求迅速实行朝鲜停战。决议要求朝鲜的谈判双方以协商精神和寻求协议的诚意，按照日内瓦公约原则，在合理的基础上迅速解决遣返战俘问题，从而实现朝鲜停战和远东和平。
    中国红十字会会长李德全随同建议提出的一项声明，在谈到已经解决的许多有关朝鲜停战的复杂问题和双方业已取得协议的朝鲜停战协定草案六十三款时说：余下的悬而未决的问题——战俘遣返问题，不应该成为问题，因为日内瓦公约第一百一十八条具体规定实际战争停止后，战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延。同时，双方在停战协定草案中已经就关于对战俘的安排的条款达成协议。
    声明接着说：朝中方面四月二十六日和五月七日所提出的两个方案，提供了解决这个未得解决的问题的办法。这两个方案是公平合理的、切实可行的。但是，停战不是单方面的事；只有双方都有停止敌对行为和互相让步的诚意时，才能达成协议。
    声明强调说：在这个朝鲜形势发展的紧急关头，红十字会协会的会员们应该利用恢复谈判所提供的机会，继续根据拥护日内瓦公约的尊严与精神的原则，努力促双方互相协商以实现停战，各国红十字会应该采取行动促进人类的利益和人道原则。
    执行委员会在闭幕会上还根据苏联代表鲍里斯·帕奇科夫博士的建议一致通过一项决议，要求双方立即“在双方同意的期间”停止“朝鲜的一切敌对行动，以便使目前的停战谈判在最良好的环境中进行”。
    苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会副主席帕奇科夫博士在他原来的建议中要求停止轰炸朝鲜和平城市与乡村，在英国及加拿大代表提出修正并为苏联代表同意后，这个决议以其现有形式获得通过。在会议一致通过这个决议以后，帕奇科夫博士发言，要求把这个决议立即送交朝鲜交战双方。
    在这以前，李德全曾经发表声明，说明中国红十字会怎样帮助中国境内日本侨民实现他们回国的愿望。她强调指出中国境内日本侨民回国以前所受到的良好待遇、中国人民为了使他们便于回国而对他们采取的优待措施和给他们的热情帮助、以及回国的日本人民所表示的谢意。李德全说：“中国红十字会和三个有关的日本人民团体讨论协助中国境内日侨回国问题的圆满结果，证明可以用协商方式对促进全世界人民之间的友谊作出巨大贡献。”
    红十字会协会理事会主席瑞典的埃米尔·桑兹特朗在执行委员会开幕词中对日本侨民回国表示欣慰。在会议休息期间，他亲自就中国红十字会在使这项工作得以顺利进行所作的贡献向中国代表表示敬意。在讨论救济天然灾害受难者问题时，英国和印度的代表对于中国人民捐款给他们两国人民表示感谢。
    红十字会协会执行委员会下一次会议将在十一月三十日到十二月五日在日内瓦举行。
    中国红十字会代表团在二十四日由日内瓦抵达布拉格，已在二十五日晨离此回国。
