Across the vast Soviet land, from Murmansk near the Arctic Sea to the Pamirs in the south, from the Kuril Islands in the Far East to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea coast, the atmosphere everywhere was filled with the joy of celebrating the holiday. Military parades were held in cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Baku, Khabarovsk, and Vladivostok. Workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals held grand parades. The paraders reported to their beloved Communist Party of the Soviet Union and government on their glorious completion of the May Day production pledges, and the brilliant achievements made in the socialist competition to strive for the completion and overfulfillment of the Five-Year Plan. Thousands upon thousands of flags and banners were inscribed with "Peace," and thousands upon thousands of people shouted "Peace." The holiday parade in every place became a powerful demonstration of the unbreakable unity of the Soviet people of all nationalities, showing that the Soviet people fully support the policies formulated by the Communist Party and the government.

From early morning until late at night, the streets of Soviet cities and villages were filled with joyful crowds.

In Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, blooming flowers in the gardens and happy Kievans joyfully greeted May Day. Kreshchatyk Street, Vladimir Hill, and the banks of the Dnieper River were crowded with people. Countless residents went out of the city to the Boyarsky Forest surrounding the city for picnics. Thousands upon thousands of people were boating on the wide Dnieper River all day long.
