Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 13th: According to a report in the London "Daily Worker" on the 9th, the U.S. Army authorities have confined 23 American prisoners of war repatriated from Korea to the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Pennsylvania. These American soldiers have been deprived of their freedom and are being treated as "mentally ill" and subjected to "special treatment" in the Army hospital.

They are receiving this treatment because they were unable to provide the so-called stories of abuse that U.S. Army officials and American reporters demanded of them upon arrival at Panmunjom. Even Colonel Philip Smith, the chief psychiatrist at Valley Forge Army Hospital, could not help but express surprise that these men were being labeled as "mentally ill."

Although the U.S. Army authorities have tried to prevent these men from speaking out, ten of them held their own press conference. They said that they were disgusted that American newspapers echoed the military in insisting that they were "brainwashed" mental patients. They also revealed the treatment they received from the U.S. military authorities. Soldier Roger Haddon, from Jacksonville, Florida, said that the treatment was a "despicable trick."

Among these soldiers was Robert Steele, a black soldier from Baltimore, who had been a prisoner for twenty-eight months. He said that all the news about "brainwashing" was "completely stupid rumors."

Corporal William Hinkle of Clintonville explained why the U.S. Army authorities dared not release these men. He said that everyone in the prisoner-of-war camp where he resided had signed a peace declaration.

Corporal Paul Schuner of San Francisco had expressed his hope for peace in several letters written to his family, and his parents had actively participated in the effort to achieve a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Therefore, when he arrived at Panmunjom, he was listed as a "no interview" person before reporters could interview him. He has now been sent to Letterman Army Hospital.

This arbitrary deprivation of freedom of repatriated American prisoners of war by the U.S. Army authorities has aroused a wave of dissatisfaction across the country. Under these circumstances, even the bourgeois newspapers had to admit that the measures were inappropriate. The "Washington Post" commented that this approach was "extremely unwise" and "very ruthless." The "New York Times" said that the soldiers confined in Valley Forge had raised "reasonable, angry protests about being treated as victims of Communist propaganda." The "Baltimore Sun" said that these men had been treated extremely unfairly, and that "the whole thing has been messed up, and messed up badly."

    美政府剥夺被遣返战俘的自由
    已在美国全国引起不满
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】据伦敦“工人日报”九日报道，美国陆军当局把二十三名从朝鲜被遣返的美国战俘关在宾夕法尼亚州熔炉谷陆军医院中。这批美国士兵被剥夺了自由，他们被当作“精神病人”，在陆军医院中受“特别治疗”。
    他们受到这样的待遇是因为他们到板门店时不能提供美国陆军官员与美国记者向他们要求的所谓被虐待的消息。甚至熔炉谷陆军医院的精神病科主任医师菲利普·史密斯上校也不能不对于这批人被称为“精神病人”表示惊异。
    尽管美国陆军当局设法禁止这批人发表谈话，但是，他们中有十个人还是自行举行了记者招待会。他们说，他们厌恶美国报纸附和军人，硬说他们是“洗过脑筋”的精神病人。他们并说出了美国军事当局对待他们的情况。家住在佛罗里达州杰克逊维尔的士兵罗杰·赫敦说，这种对待是“卑鄙的勾当”。
    这批士兵中有巴尔的摩的黑人士兵罗伯特·斯蒂尔，他被俘了二十八个月。他说，所有关于“洗脑筋”的消息“完全是愚蠢的谣言”。
    克林敦维尔的威廉·欣克尔下士说明美国陆军当局为什么不敢释放这批人的理由。他说，他居住的战俘营中每个人都曾在和平宣言上签了名。
    旧金山的保罗·舒纳下士在写给家中的几封信中曾表示希望和平，他的父母都积极地参加了争取和平解决朝鲜问题的工作，因此，当他到达板门店时，在记者访问他之前就被列为“不准接见记者”的人。现在他已被送往莱特曼陆军医院。
    美国陆军当局这种任意剥夺被遣返的美国战俘的自由的行为已在全国引起不满的浪潮。在这种情形下，甚至资产阶级报纸也不得不承认措置失当。“华盛顿邮报”评论说，这种办法是“极端不智”与“非常无情”的。“纽约时报”说，被关在熔炉谷的士兵“对于他们被当作共产党宣传的受害者一事提出了合理的、愤怒的抗议”。“巴尔的摩太阳报”说，这批人受到极端不公正的待遇，“整个事情已经给弄糟了，而且大大地弄糟了。”
