How China Should Industrialize
Ji Yun

The construction of our country's long-awaited first Five-Year Plan has now begun. Its basic task is to gradually realize national industrialization.

Industrialization is the ideal of our people for a hundred years. From the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, some people began to establish a few factories in our country. However, China's industry has never developed. The Qing government, the Northern Warlord government, and the Kuomintang reactionary government were unable to solve the great task of China's industrialization. The main reason why our country was bullied in the past and became a target for aggressive powers was that we did not have our own industry, especially our own heavy industry and defense industry. As Stalin said: "China is ravaged by all those who act arbitrarily because it does not have its own heavy industry and its own military industry." ("Summary of the First Five-Year Plan")

Only the People's Government led by the Chinese Communist Party can solve the great historical task of China's industrialization. Our motherland will be built in our generation, in the era of Mao Zedong. We must fundamentally change the face of our country, and unearth the rich resources sleeping underground for thousands of years to make them serve the people. Countless new cities will rise on empty plains, with wisps of smoke from factory chimneys lingering over these cities.

Facts have proved what Chairman Mao said eight years ago: "Without an independent, free, democratic, and unified China, it is impossible to develop industry." Chairman Mao declared at that time: "After the new-democratic political conditions are obtained, the Chinese people and their government must take practical steps to gradually establish heavy and light industries within a few years, so that China will change from an agricultural country to an industrial country." ("On Coalition Government") Now we are precisely going to realize this great prediction of Chairman Mao. The new-democratic political conditions have now been obtained: the People's Republic of China has been founded for more than three years, and various social reform movements have been completed to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and prepare for economic construction, and the economic recovery work has also ended. The central task in the future is to carry out large-scale construction and realize national industrialization.

We are now in an important period of transition, in a period of transition like Lenin said, "from a peasant's, farmer's, and poor man's carriage," "crossing to a huge machine industry, electrification... carriage."

We should regard the period of national transition to industrialization as a revolutionary transition period of the same importance as the period of seizing power. Let us see how Stalin assessed the period when the Soviet Union began its industrialization. He said: "I believe that although there is a very huge difference between the period of preparation for the October Revolution that existed eight years ago and the current period that has passed eight years since the October Revolution, there is still a common point. This common point lies in the fact that both periods reflect a turning point in the development of our revolution. At that time, in 1917, the question was to transition from bourgeois power to proletarian power. Now, in 1925, the question is to transition from the current economic structure, which cannot be called a complete socialist economy, to a socialist economy, that is, to an economy that should become the material basis of socialism." ("The October Revolution, Lenin, and the Future of Our Development")

It was precisely because the Soviet Union implemented these two important policies of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization that it was able to build a single socialist economy from a complex economic structure containing five economic components, to transform from a backward agricultural country into the world's first-class industrial power, to defeat the invasion of German fascism in World War II, and to become a strong fortress for defending world peace.

We are building our country by taking the Soviet Union as an example. The Soviet Union's experience in realizing national industrialization is extremely useful to us.

China's new-democratic system is a transitional period to socialism. The process of our country gradually realizing industrialization is also the process of gradually carrying out socialist transformation of our national economy. The foundation of socialism is large-scale industry. Lenin said: "... there is only one true and unique foundation for building a socialist society, and that is large-scale industry. Without the large factories of capitalism, without highly equipped large-scale industry, there can be no talk of socialism in general, and especially no talk of socialism for a peasant country." (Selected Works of Lenin, Chinese edition, Volume 16, page 287)

Therefore, in order to enable our country to successfully transition to socialism in the future, we must build large-scale industry. Only on the basis of large-scale industry can we establish socialist public ownership of the means of production and carry out socialist common labor. Countless facts have proved that attempts to implement socialism on the basis of small-scale agriculture or small-scale handicrafts are not feasible. Industry must be developed in order to provide the possibility for the collectivization and mechanization of agriculture, and to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

At the same time, only after our country is industrialized can we guarantee our country's economic independence and not be dependent on imperialism. Our country has already gained political independence and liberation, but imperialist countries still calculate that we cannot do without them economically. They still expect us to always be in a position to only produce agricultural products and industrial raw materials, and the industrial products we need must be imported from imperialist countries. Therefore, we must establish our own industry, not only light industry that produces consumer goods, but also heavy industry that can supply various industrial equipment. Only in this way can we guarantee our country's economic independence.

In addition, national industrialization is the foundation of our country's defense modernization. Only by developing heavy industry and defense industry can we arm our army with the latest weapons. In this way, our country can be spared the sudden attacks of imperialist countries.

These are the reasons why we want to realize national industrialization.

So, what is industrialization? To what extent should a country's industry develop before it can be considered industrialized?

(1) Industrialization first of all means that the proportion of industry in the entire national economy is greater than that of agriculture.

Let us cite a few figures to illustrate this issue.

For example, we say that our country is an agricultural country. The reason is that before the victory of the revolution, industry only accounted for about 10 percent of the entire national economy, while agriculture accounted for about 90 percent. After the victory of the revolution, after three years of economic recovery work, industry only rose to more than 20 percent, and did not fundamentally change the basic situation that our country is an agricultural country.

The Soviet Union was also an agricultural country before the victory of the revolution. At that time, the proportion of industry in Russia was 42.1 percent. Lenin and Stalin called it an extremely backward Russia, but its level of industrial development was actually much higher than our current level. This also shows that the task of industrialization in our country is even more arduous.

In the fourth year that the Soviet Union began to realize industrialization, that is, in 1929-30, the proportion of Soviet industry had risen to 53 percent, while the proportion of agriculture only accounted for 47 percent. At this time, Stalin announced that this means that the proportion of industry has begun to exceed the proportion of agriculture in the overall system of the national economy, "We are now on the eve of transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country." ("Political Report of the Central Committee to the 16th Congress of the CPSU (B)")

After the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the proportion of Soviet industry had risen to 70.4 percent, while the proportion of agriculture only accounted for 29.6 percent. At this time, Stalin announced: "This means that our country has firmly and reliably finally become an industrial country." ("Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) at the 17th Party Congress")

It seems that industrialization is achieved when industry accounts for about 70 percent of the entire national economy. In order to achieve industrialization, our country must also make industry reach such a proportion in the entire national economy.

(2) There must be heavy industry. Simply having a larger proportion of industry than agriculture cannot be called industrialization. For example, although the industry in this country is also very developed, the industries they develop are all light industries, and there is little or no heavy industry. The machinery and other means of production needed in their factories must be imported from countries with more developed heavy industries. This means that they cannot be economically independent and must rely on other countries. Obviously, a country that cannot be economically independent cannot be called an industrialized country. Stalin once used India as an example to illustrate that simply the general development of industry cannot be called industrialization. India also has industry, and industry is also developing, but what India is developing is some industries that do not produce means of production. The means of production they need are imported from the United Kingdom. Therefore, India's industry is completely subordinate to the United Kingdom's industry. Some people have seen that India has a certain industrial development and think that India has been industrialized. In fact, India's economy can only be called a colonial economy, not industrialization.

Therefore, the more important meaning of industrialization is to develop heavy industry, that is, to ensure that the country can be economically independent. Because only by developing heavy industry, only by equipping all production departments, including heavy industry and light industry, with our own means of production, can we guarantee the country's economic independence and not be subject to the rule of capitalist countries with developed heavy industries. This is the true realization of industrialization.

Stalin said: "Some comrades think that industrialization in general is just developing any kind of industry at will. ... This is of course incorrect. It is not said that developing industry in any way is industrialization. The center of industrialization, its foundation, is to develop heavy industry (fuel, hardware, etc.), and in the final analysis, it is to develop the production of means of production, to develop the country's machine manufacturing industry. The task of industrialization is not only to increase the proportion of industry in our country's entire national economy, but also to ensure, in this development, the economic independence of our country surrounded by capitalist countries, and to prevent it from becoming an appendage of world capitalism."
("On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy")

Do all comrades here realize that only with heavy industry can there be industrialization? But in fact, some comrades think: "Since the country is going to start industrialization, then allow us to build this or that factory here!" This idea of ​​no focus and wanting to industrialize everywhere is actually canceling the country's industrialization and should be firmly opposed. Because if the country does not concentrate its efforts to first build industries that are of decisive significance to the country, but instead divides its forces and builds everything and everywhere, it will disperse the country's limited human and financial resources, and as a result, we will not be able to build anything.

(3) Carry out industrialization starting from the development of heavy industry. It is very clear that industrialization is to develop heavy industry. But when we carry out industrialization, do we develop heavy industry from the very beginning? Or do we first develop light industry and then develop heavy industry? This distinction is very important. These are two different methods of industrialization. Starting from heavy industry is the method of socialist industrialization; starting from light industry is the method of capitalist industrialization.

There are only these two methods of industrialization in the world. Which method of industrialization should we adopt?

We should adopt the method of socialist industrialization. Socialist industrialization not only means that national industrialization should ensure that the proportion of the socialist state-owned economy in the entire national economy continues to rise, and ensure that the country's economy will transition to socialism in the future, but also means that industrialization should be carried out starting from heavy industry.

The method of capitalist industrialization is completely unsuitable for us. Capitalist countries usually start industrialization from light industry. This is because the purpose of capitalists in starting factories is to obtain profits. They see that light industry requires less investment than heavy industry, capital turns over quickly, and it is easy to obtain profits, so they first start light industry. Only after a considerable period of time, when light industry has developed and all departments of light industry have made demands on heavy industry, is it profitable to operate heavy industry. Only at this time are people willing to invest in heavy industry. At the same time, it is also because light industry has developed at this time, and funds have been accumulated from light industry, so it is possible to transfer the accumulated funds to heavy industry.

The development process of capitalist industrialization is a long and slow process. It took various capitalist countries almost a hundred years to complete their industrialization. If we want to adopt the method of capitalist industrialization, then we have to wait silently for the development of light industry for decades, and live hard without heavy industry. In this way, we will let the time pass and fail to quickly establish heavy industry and defense industry. Our country will not be able to guarantee economic independence for a long time, and will always be in danger of being invaded by imperialism at any time.

The method of socialist industrialization is the opposite of the method of capitalist industrialization. It carries out industrialization starting from the development of heavy industry. The socialist industrialization method starting from heavy industry reflects the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism and other laws. Because the purpose of socialist production is not to obtain profits for individual producers, but to meet the material and cultural needs of the entire society; socialist production is not regulated by the law of value, but is regulated by the law of planned development; the principle of socialist production is not low-level immediate profits, but high-level long-term profits. For these reasons, although heavy industry cannot make a profit at the beginning, it is needed by society and can make a profit in the future, so socialist industrialization can use all its efforts to develop heavy industry at the beginning.

We must adopt the method of socialist industrialization and carry out industrialization starting from the establishment of heavy industry in order to buy time, in order to establish heavy industry and defense industry in a short period of time. In this way, in a short period of time, our country can achieve economic independence without relying on imperialist countries, and can strengthen our national defense, and be able to counterattack the aggression of imperialism at any time.

We are many years behind the economy of capitalist countries. We can no longer move slowly along the old path of capitalist countries, but should take another path in order to catch up with capitalist countries in a short period of time. The Soviet Union has already opened up a new road to industrialization in front of us. The Soviet Union only took thirteen years to realize socialist industrialization. The Soviet Union ran the road that capitalist countries had traveled in a hundred years in thirteen years. From here, we can also see that the method of socialist industrialization is superior to the method of capitalist industrialization.

Is there no problem for each of us comrades about starting industrialization from heavy industry? Unfortunately, it cannot be said so. In the view of some comrades, there is no problem with industrialization focusing on heavy industry, but it is not necessarily starting industrialization from heavy industry. They believe that we can first start building light industry, because the funds needed to build light industry are not much and can be built quickly. We can accumulate funds from the development of light industry, and then develop heavy industry. They believe that our current environment is much better than when the Soviet Union began to implement industrialization, so in our country, it is also possible for industrialization to proceed at a slow pace.

These ideas are actually nostalgic for the method of capitalist industrialization. They attempt to achieve industrialization very easily and effortlessly, and are unwilling to carry out arduous work in the great cause of transforming our country from an agricultural country to an industrial country. They cannot find a source of funds other than the road they recognize - developing light industry - they do not believe that we can leave this road and find a way out from improving the operation of existing state-owned enterprises, increasing the profits of existing state-owned enterprises, vigorously increasing production and practicing economy, and mobilizing the strength of the people across the country. Although our current environment is very good, with the help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries that have successfully built socialism, it is not as difficult as when the Soviet Union carried out construction alone at that time. But these cannot make us feel at ease to live with slow economic development, nor can they make us ignore the fact that imperialist countries may invade our country.

But starting from heavy industry and carrying out industrialization at a faster pace does not mean that construction can be carried out blindly and rashly without considering actual possibilities. Some of our lovers of big plans always like to build factories as large as possible, and they always put forward very large but difficult to complete tasks for themselves. May I ask what are these plans and tasks based on? Only subjective wishes, and do not consider actual possibilities. They do not act according to their abilities and advance steadily, but blindly advance. If we were to carry out construction according to the impatient mood of these comrades, then we would not be able to build anything.

Industrialization takes a certain amount of time, and one cannot hope that a country with a small agricultural production dominating can achieve industrialization in one morning. The idea of blind advance seriously hinders the cause of industrialization in our country. In order to make the industrialization of our country proceed on the right track, we must focus on opposing this erroneous idea.

    我国怎样进行工业化
    季云
    我们渴望已久的我国第一个五年计划的建设，现在已经开始进行了。它的基本任务就是逐步地实现国家工业化。
    工业化是我们人民百年来的理想。从满清末年和民国初年的时候起，就有一些人开始在我国建立少许的工厂。但是我国的工业始终没有发展起来。满清政府、北洋军阀政府和国民党反动政府都不能解决我国工业化这个伟大的任务。我们国家过去被人欺负，成为强敌用武的对象，主要原因就在于我们没有自己的工业，特别是没有自己的重工业和国防工业。正像斯大林所说的：“中国因为没有自己的重工业，没有自己的军事工业，而被一切逞性妄为的人所蹂躏着。”（“第一个五年计划的总结”）
    只有中国共产党领导的人民政府才能解决我国工业化这个伟大的历史任务。我们祖国就在我们这一代，就在毛泽东的时代建设起来。我们要使我国的面貌发生根本的变化，要把睡眠在地下千万年的丰富资源发掘出来，使它为人民服务。无数座新的城市将在空旷的平地上升起，在这些城市的上空萦绕着从工厂烟筒冒出的缕缕煤烟。
    事实证明了毛主席在八年前说的话：“没有一个独立、自由、民主和统一的中国，不可能发展工业。”毛主席那时就已宣告：“在新民主主义的政治条件获得之后，中国人民及其政府必须采取切实的步骤，在若干年内逐步地建立重工业和轻工业，使中国由农业国变为工业国。”（“论联合政府”）现在我们正是要实现毛主席的这个伟大预言。新民主主义的政治条件现在已经获得了：中华人民共和国已经建国三年多，为了巩固人民民主专政和为了准备经济建设的各种社会改革运动已经完成，经济恢复工作也已结束。今后的中心任务就是进行大规模建设，实现国家工业化。
    现在我们正处在一个重要的转变时期，处在像列宁所说的“由农民的，庄稼汉的，穷苦的马上”，“跨到巨大机器工业，电气化……的马上去”的转变时期。
    我们应该把国家向工业化过渡的时期，看成和夺取政权的时期那样有同样重要意义的革命转变时期。请看斯大林是怎样估价苏联开始工业化的时期吧。他说：“我认为，在八年前存在的准备十月革命时期与自十月革命后已过去八年了的目前时期之间，虽然有十分巨大的差别，但是仍然有一个共同点。这个共同点就在于：这两个时期都反映着我国革命发展的转变关头。当时，在一九一七年，问题曾是要由资产阶级政权过渡到无产阶级政权。现在，在一九二五年，问题则是要由现在这个不能称为完全的社会主义经济，过渡到社会主义经济，即过渡到应当成为社会主义物质基础的经济。”（“十月革命，列宁和我国发展的前途”）
    苏联正是由于实行了国家工业化和农业集体化这两项重要的政策，它才能由包含五种经济成份的错综复杂的经济结构，建成了单一的社会主义经济，才能由一个落后的农业国变为现时世界上第一等的工业强国，才能在第二次世界大战中击败了德国法西斯的侵略，并在现在成为保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    我们是以苏联为榜样来建设我们的国家。苏联实现国家工业化的经验对于我们极有用处。
    我国的新民主主义制度是走向社会主义的过渡时期。我们国家逐步实现工业化的过程，也就是将我们的国民经济逐步地进行社会主义改造的过程。社会主义的基础是大工业，列宁说：“……建立社会主义社会的真正的和唯一的基础，只有一个，这就是大工业。如果没有资本主义的大工厂，没有高度设备的大工业，那就一般地谈不到社会主义，对于一个农民的国度，尤其谈不到社会主义了。”（列宁选集中文版，十六卷，二八七页）
    因此，为了使我们国家将来能够胜利地向社会主义转变，就必须建设大工业。只有在大工业的基础上，才能建立对于生产资料的社会主义公共所有制，才能进行社会主义的共同劳动。有无数事实证明：企图在小农业或小手工业的基础上来实行社会主义，都是行不通的。必须使工业发展起来，才能为农业的集体化和机械化提供可能性，才能对农业进行社会主义的改造。
    同时，也只有使我国工业化以后，才能保证我国经济上的独立，而不依赖帝国主义。我们国家在政治上已经获得独立解放了，但是帝国主义国家还算定我们在经济上离开他们不行。他们还指望我们永远地处在只出产农产品和工业原料的地位，而我们所必需的工业品就非要由帝国主义国家输入不可。因此，我们就必须建立自己的工业，不仅要建立生产消费品的轻工业，而且要建立能够供给各种工业装备的重工业，只有这样，才能保证我国经济的独立。
    此外，国家工业化是我国国防现代化的基础。我们只有把重工业和国防工业发展起来，才能用最新式的武器将军队武装起来。这样，我们国家就能免遭帝国主义国家的突然袭击。
    这就是我们为什么要实现国家工业化的理由。
    那么，什么是工业化呢？一个国家的工业要发展到什么程度，才算工业化了呢？
    （一）工业化首先就是表示在整个国民经济中工业的比重大于农业。
    我们举几个数字来说明这个问题。
    例如我们说，我们国家是一个农业国，根据就是在革命胜利前，工业在整个国民经济中只占百分之十左右，而农业却占了百分之九十左右。在革命胜利后，经过了三年来的经济恢复工作，工业也只上升到百分之二十多，并没有根本地改变我们国家是农业国的这一基本情况。
    苏联在革命胜利前，也是一个农业国。当时俄国工业所占的比重是百分之四十二点一。列宁、斯大林称为极端落后的俄罗斯，其实它的工业发展水平比我们现在还高得多。这也说明了我们国家工业化的任务是更艰巨的。
    在苏联开始实现工业化的第四个年头，即一九二九——三○年度，苏联工业的比重已上升到百分之五十三，而农业的比重只占百分之四十七。这时，斯大林就宣布说：这就是说，在国民经济的总体系中，工业的比重已经开始超过农业的比重了，“我们现时已处在变农业国为工业国的前夜了。”（“联共（布）第十六次代表大会中央委员会的政治报告”）
    在第一个五年计划完成以后，苏联工业的比重已上升到百分之七十点四，而农业的比重只占百分之二十九点六了。这时，斯大林宣告：“这就是说，我们国家已坚实可靠地最终变成工业国家了。”（“在第十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”）
    这样看来，工业在整个国民经济中占百分之七十左右，就算是工业化了。我们国家要达到工业化，也必须使工业在整个国民经济中达到这样的比重。
    （二）必须有重工业。只是工业的比重大于农业的比重还不能叫作工业化。例如，这个国家虽然工业也很发达，但是他们所发展的工业都是轻工业，没有或很少有重工业。他们工厂里所需用的机器等生产资料，还要从重工业比较发达的国家输入。这就是说，他们在经济上还不能独立，还要依赖别的国家。显然，一个在经济上不能独立的国家，就不能叫作工业化的国家。斯大林曾以印度为例来说明：只是工业的一般发展，还不能叫作工业化。印度也有工业，并且工业也在发展，但是印度发展的是一些不出产生产资料的工业，他们所需用的生产资料是由英国输入的，因此，印度的工业就完全隶属于英国的工业。有人看到印度有了一定的工业的发展，就以为印度已经工业化了。其实印度的经济还只能叫作殖民地经济，而不能叫作工业化。
    因此，工业化的更重要的意义就是发展重工业，就是保证国家在经济上能够独立。因为只有发展了重工业，只有用自己出产的生产资料来装备包括重工业和轻工业都在内的一切生产部门，才能够保证国家的经济独立，而不致受治于重工业发达的资本主义国家。这样，才是真正地达到了工业化。
    斯大林说：“有些同志以为：工业化一般就是随便发展一种工业。……这当然是不正确的。不是说随便怎样发展工业都是工业化。工业化底中心，它的基础，就是发展重工业（燃料、五金等等），归根到底，就是发展生产资料底生产，发展本国的机器制造业。工业化的任务不仅在于使我国整个国民经济增加自己的工业比重，而且它的任务还在于在这种发展中保证被资本主义国家所包围的我国在经济上的独立，防止它变为世界资本主义底附属品。”
    （“论苏联经济状况和党底政策”）
    在我们这里是不是所有的同志都认识到只有具有了重工业才是工业化呢？可是实际上有些同志却以为：“既然国家要开始工业化，那就允许我们这里建立这种或那种的工厂吧！”这种没有重点，处处要工业化的想法，其实就是取消国家的工业化，是应当坚决反对的。因为不由国家集中力量，首先建立对国家有决定意义的工业，而是平分力量，什么都建设，各地都建设，就会把国家有限的人力和资金分散地使用掉了，结果，我们就会什么都建设不起来。
    （三）从发展重工业开始进行工业化。工业化是要发展重工业，这是很清楚的了。但是我们进行工业化是一开始就发展重工业呢？还是首先发展轻工业，然后再发展重工业呢？这种区别很重要、这是两种不同的工业化的方法。从重工业开始，是社会主义工业化的方法；从轻工业开始，是资本主义工业化的方法。
    世界上只有这两种工业化的方法。我们应该采取那一种工业化的方法呢？
    我们应该采取社会主义工业化的方法。社会主义工业化不仅是说国家工业化应该保证社会主义的国营经济在整个国民经济中的比重不断上升，保证国家经济将来向社会主义转变，而且是说应该从重工业开始来进行工业化。
    资本主义工业化的方法对我们是完全不适用的。资本主义国家进行工业化，通常是从轻工业开始。这是因为资本家开办工厂的目的是为了获得利润，他们看到轻工业比重工业所需的投资数量要少，资本周转得快，容易获得利润，所以就首先去开办轻工业。只有经过一个相当长的时间，等轻工业发展起来，轻工业各部门都对重工业提出了要求，这时来经营重工业已是有利可图的事了，只是在这时，才有人肯投资于重工业。同时也因为这时轻工业发展起来，从轻工业方面积累了资金，才有可能将积累起来的资金转投于重工业。
    资本主义工业化的发展过程是一个长久缓慢的过程。各个资本主义国家完成他们的工业化，差不多费了一百年的时光。如果我们要采取资本主义工业化的方法，那么我们就要在数十年之久的时间内，静等轻工业的发展，而在没有重工业的情况下勉强过活。这样我们就会把时间放过，不能很快地将重工业和国防工业建立起来，我们国家就会在很长的时期内还不能保证经济上的独立，还时刻经受着帝国主义可以随时侵袭我们的危险。
    社会主义工业化的方法与资本主义工业化的方法相反，它是从发展重工业开始去进行工业化。从重工业开始的社会主义工业化方法是反映了社会主义的基本经济法则和其他法则的要求。因为社会主义生产的目的不是为了生产者个人获得利润，而是为了满足整个社会的物质和文化生活需要；社会主义的生产不受价值法则调剂，而是受有计划发展的法则调剂；社会主义生产的原则不是低级的眼前的赢利，而是高级的长远的赢利。根据这些原因，虽然重工业在开始时不能赢利，但是因为它却为社会所需要，它以后却能赢利，所以社会主义的工业化在一开始时就能用全力去发展重工业。
    我们要采取社会主义工业化的方法，要从建立重工业开始来进行工业化，就是为了争取时间，为了在短时期内将重工业和国防工业建立起来。这样在短时期内，我们国家就可以达到经济的独立，而不依赖帝国主义国家，就可以使我们的国防加强起来，而能随时给帝国主义的侵略行为以迎头痛击。
    我们比资本主义国家的经济落后了很多年，我们再不能循着资本主义国家的老路缓步前进，而应该走另外一条道路，以便在短时间内追过资本主义国家。苏联已经在我们前面开辟了一条走上工业化的新道路。苏联实现社会主义的工业化，只有十三年的时间。苏联在十三年内跑过了资本主义国家一百年所走过的路程。从这里也就看到了社会主义工业化的方法比资本主义工业化的方法优越。
    从重工业开始进行工业化，这点对于我们每个同志来说，是不是都没有问题了呢？可惜还不能这样说。在有些同志看来，工业化以重工业为重点是无问题了，但是不一定从重工业开始进行工业化。他们认为可以首先着手建立轻工业，因为建立轻工业所需资金不多，能够很快地建立起来。我们可以由轻工业的发展中积累资金，然后再去发展重工业。他们认为我们现在所处的环境比苏联开始实行工业化时要好得多，因此在我们这里，工业化以缓慢的速度进行着也是可以的。
    这些想法实际上是对于资本主义工业化方法的留恋。他们企图很轻松地毫不费力地达到工业化，而不愿意在使我国由农业国变为工业国的这一伟大事业上进行艰苦的工作。他们除了从他们所认定的道路上——发展轻工业——再找不到积累资金的来源，他们不相信我们可以离开这条道路，而从改善现有国营企业的经营，提高现有国营企业的利润，厉行增产节约和动员全国人民的力量来寻找出路。我们现在所处的环境虽然很好，有社会主义建设成功了的苏联及各人民民主国家的帮助，不像那时苏联单枪匹马地进行建设那样困难。但是这些丝毫不能使我们可以安心地以缓慢的经济发展来过活，不能使我们忽视帝国主义国家可能侵犯我国的事实。
    但是从重工业开始，以较快的速度来进行工业化，也不是说可以不根据实际可能而盲目地急躁地进行建设。我们有些大计划的爱好者，总喜欢工厂建设得越大越好，他们总给自己提出了很大的但是很难完成的任务。试问这些计划和这些任务的提出，是根据什么呢？只是主观的愿望，而并不考虑实际的可能性。他们不是量力而行，稳步前进，而是盲目冒进。如果要按照这些同志的急躁情绪去进行建设，那么，我们就会什么都建设不起来。
    工业化是需要一定的时间的，不能希望一个小农业生产占优势的国家在一个早晨就能实现工业化。盲目冒进的思想严重地阻碍了我国工业化的事业，我们要使我国的工业化按照正确的轨道进行，就必须着重地反对这种错误的思想。
