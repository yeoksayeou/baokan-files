The Industrial Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to implement the instruction of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on launching a responsibility system movement in basic construction design departments, convened a symposium on May 7th with relevant responsible cadres from design departments throughout the city to study how to establish a responsibility system in design departments.

The main problems currently existing in design work in Harbin City's design units are: Firstly, most units do not have personnel specifically responsible for planning work, do not have a practical grasp of their own design capabilities, and the plans formulated lack a scientific basis. After formulation, they are not fully mobilized for mass discussion, so the plans formulated are either conservative or involve calculating backward from deadlines (planning based on the start date instead of the actual progress of the design work itself, determining the start date). Or they become unworkable midway, making it impossible to realize the original plan, and the plan becomes a mere formality. Secondly, a technical responsibility system has not been established, and a sound review system is lacking. Design personnel still have various ideological concerns, are afraid of taking responsibility in design and review work, are careless, and pass the buck. After the design is completed, they are unwilling to review it, or review it irresponsibly, resulting in a large backlog of drawings and delaying the start of construction. Thirdly, there is still a phenomenon of no one being responsible for confidentiality. No one is specifically responsible for the storage and use of design drawings and original materials, and there is no set system, resulting in the loss of drawings or serious security breaches due to private removal. Furthermore, chaotic drawing management causes wasted effort in design.

Due to the existence of the above problems, design quality is not high, and progress cannot keep up with construction requirements. Therefore, the comrades who attended the symposium all believed that the instruction of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to establish and implement a responsibility system as the central task of the second quarter is also suitable for the actual situation of design departments. They also clarified that it is necessary to analyze the specific situation of their own units in a pragmatic spirit, grasp the key issues affecting quality and progress, and first establish several urgently needed responsibility systems. Generally speaking, at present, plan responsibility system, technical responsibility system, review responsibility system, confidentiality responsibility system, administrative responsibility system, and design responsibility to construction should be established in a step-by-step manner.

The following points should be noted in establishing the responsibility system: 1. Since the design work is currently in a tense stage, it is necessary to closely integrate it with the current work and promote the current design work by establishing a responsibility system, preventing the tendency of separating from production and engaging in isolated movements. 2. It is necessary to strengthen ideological education for design personnel, and education should be carried out from a positive perspective for all personnel, pointing out the glory of standing in the position of design work in the country's large-scale economic construction, and the importance of national planning and the responsibility system, to inspire them to discuss, formulate and implement various responsibility systems on a conscious basis. 3. It must be recognized that the establishment and improvement of the responsibility system is not a blitz campaign, but a process of gradually consolidating the established responsibility system through regular work summaries.

### 哈尔滨市设计部门座谈建立责任制问题

    哈尔滨市设计部门座谈建立责任制问题
    中共哈尔滨市委工业部，为了在基本建设设计部门贯彻中共中央东北局开展责任制运动的指示，于五月七日召开了全市各设计部门有关负责干部座谈会，研究如何在设计部门建立责任制问题。
    哈尔滨市各设计单位目前设计中存在的主要问题：首先是多数单位在计划工作上没有专人负责，对自己的设计力量没有切实的掌握，制订的计划缺乏科学根据，制订后也未充分发动群众讨论，所以制订的计划不是保守便是倒算时间（不是按设计本身的进度来排计划，确定开工日期，而是按开工日期来倒排设计计划），或者是中途行不通，使原计划不能实现，使计划流于形式。其次是没有建立技术责任制，没有健全的审查制度。设计人员还有各种思想顾虑，在设计及审查工作中怕负责任，粗枝大叶，互相推诿，设计完后不愿审查，或不负责任地审查，造成图纸大批积压，拖延了开工。第三，在保密方面还存在着无人负责现象，设计图纸原始资料的保管与使用没有专人负责，没有一定的制度，造成图纸丢失，或私自带出的严重失密现象。并由于图纸管理的混乱而造成设计上的窝工。
    由于以上问题的存在，使设计质量不高，进度也赶不上施工要求。因此参加座谈会的同志都认为中共中央东北局指示以建立与贯彻责任制为第二季度中心工作，同样适合于设计部门的实际情况；并且明确了必须以实事求是的精神，分析本单位的具体情况，抓住影响质量和进度的关键问题，首先建立几种迫切需要的责任制度。一般来说目前应有步骤地建立计划责任制、技术责任制、审查责任制、保密责任制、行政负责制、设计对施工的责任制等。
    在建立责任制的方法上应注意以下几点：一、由于目前设计工作正处于紧张阶段，必须密切结合当前工作，通过建立责任制度推动当前设计工作的进行，防止脱离生产孤立搞运动的偏向。二、必须加强对设计人员的思想教育，对全体人员应从积极方面进行教育，指出站在国家大规模经济建设中设计工作岗位上的光荣，国家计划和责任制的重要性，以启发他们在自觉的基础上讨论制定与贯彻各项责任制度。三、必须认识责任制的建立和健全不是一个突击性的运动，而要通过经常的总结工作，逐渐巩固已建立的责任制度。
