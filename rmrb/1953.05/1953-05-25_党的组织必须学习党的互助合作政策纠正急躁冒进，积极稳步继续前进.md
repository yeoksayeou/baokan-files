    In the vast rural areas across the country, Communist Party members who have undergone Party rectification education generally understand that the ultimate goal of our Party's leadership of the revolution is to implement the communist system in China. They understand that today, only by actively guiding the broad masses of peasants to "organize themselves" and taking the path of mutual aid and cooperation can we reach socialism and ultimately achieve a communist society. Therefore, after Party rectification, many Party members have changed their past passive attitude of not participating in or leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and have actively participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. After Party rectification, the average number of Party members participating in mutual aid groups in 3,847 branches in Shandong Province doubled compared to before. In areas where mutual aid and cooperation organizations have a relatively solid foundation, Party members have generally joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and in general areas, about 60% of Party members have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The rural mutual aid and cooperation movement has shown a vigorous new atmosphere, playing a huge role in restoring and developing agricultural production and alleviating the economic suffering of the masses. This is the main situation after rural Party rectification.

    However, during the Party rectification, due to insufficient education on the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies by some rural Party leadership organizations, some grassroots Party organizations and Communist Party members do not understand how to lead peasants in mutual aid and cooperation work. They do not understand that it is necessary to start from the current situation of small-scale peasant economy, dispersion, and private ownership, and do not understand the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policy of uniting working peasants and advancing steadily. They do not understand how Communist Party members can play a vanguard role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, the impatient and impetuous mood that existed in the past still exists after Party rectification, and in some places, it has even developed. This is specifically manifested in the following aspects:

    One manifestation is greed for quantity and speed. They believe that mutual aid and cooperation organizations "the more, the bigger, and the faster" they are established, the more the vanguard role of Party members can be demonstrated. Therefore, regardless of the actual needs and level of awareness of the masses, they subjectively put forward the slogans of "linking, merging, and jumping," fantasizing about organizing all the masses into mutual aid groups at once, and "jumping" all the mutual aid groups to agricultural production cooperatives at once. Some seasonal and temporary mutual aid groups have not yet been well-managed, but they want to establish year-round mutual aid groups; some have not gone through the preparatory steps of mutual aid groups at all, and directly engage in agricultural production cooperatives. They mistakenly believe that running agricultural production cooperatives is "easier" than mutual aid groups. Some people even use the method of blindly expanding "public property" to create "advanced forms." Half of the 211 public livestock groups in the second district of Beizhen, Liaoxi Province, were established or expanded during the Party rectification. Many Party members said: Early mutual aid, late mutual aid, mutual aid will happen sooner or later; late "socialization," early "socialization," one will enter "socialization" (referring to socialism) sooner or later. Therefore, the conclusion is: "Later is not as good as earlier, earlier is not as good as faster"; some villages slaughter pigs and buy wine, eat in a communal pot, and some even hang large flags with the words "Strive for Collective Farms." An agricultural production cooperative in the first district of Enxian, Shandong, has developed to 120 households, and some agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province have developed to more than 400 households. In some places, due to the blind expansion of organizations, the burden on the peasant masses has been greatly increased. For example, in the solidarity village of Jimin Village, Hailun District, Heilongjiang, the two large groups of Qi Jingchun and Liu Chunlin valued all the vehicles and horses of the group members as public property and distributed dividends according to shares. Even the land was apportioned, with Qi Jingchun's group apportioning 700,000 yuan per hectare and Liu Chunlin's group apportioning 850,000 yuan per hectare. In addition, rubber-tired carts were purchased on credit from the supply and marketing cooperative, owing 20 million yuan. These apportionments and debts had to be borne by the group members. As a result, everyone had many opinions, which affected their enthusiasm for production.

    Another manifestation is blindly setting up stalls, believing that "to run an agricultural production cooperative, you must first build a dining hall, nursery, office, club, etc." The Li Zhenshan agricultural production cooperative in Zhanyu County, Heilongjiang, originally had a very poor foundation. Most of the 13 households in the cooperative were members of individual households and temporary mutual aid groups. When the cooperative was established, the masses disagreed, but the county party committee blindly supported the cooperative, expanding public property. Not only did they dig a new well, buy two horses, four large carts, three cultivating machines, and a water mill, but they also bought two sewing machines and built 14 new houses. In addition to the cadres' dormitories, machine rooms, grain warehouses, and kitchens, there were also sewing rooms and dining halls cum clubs. It is estimated that these expenses accounted for 31.5% of the cooperative's agricultural and sideline income. During the busy farming season, four women were drawn to learn machine sewing, preparing to make clothes uniformly for all the cooperative members. Because the stall was too large and the debts were too many, the cooperative members worked for a year and not only did they not receive food, but each person had to pay back 11 shi 7 dou 2 sheng of grain. Therefore, some cooperative members reflected: "The new road is good, but we can't afford to take it."

    Still another manifestation is attacking individual farmers. They indiscriminately label individual farmers, saying that individual farmers are "backward elements, selfish and self-interested," and are "taking the capitalist road"; some even use economic blockade and spiritual pressure to treat individual farmers, not allowing individual farmers to borrow farm tools from mutual aid groups, and not allowing individual farmers to participate in bumper harvest appraisal meetings. Some even openly threaten individual farmers, saying: "If you don't participate now, you won't be allowed to participate in the future." Cadres in Dishang Village, Daming County, Hebei, set up two tables on the street and told the peasants: Socialism and capitalism are two roads, and those who are willing to take the socialist road should sign their names. Some villages held meetings to perform operas, placing the members of the agricultural production cooperative in front, and asking individual farmers to retreat to the back, publicly scolding individual farmers as "single-handed blanks" and "walking the road to death." Some individual farmers could not bear the sarcasm and attacks, felt "inferior," and were forced to join the mutual aid group. Therefore, the phenomenon of "mutual aid in name but not in reality" appeared in some places. Twelve of the 61 mutual aid groups in Datian Township, Linhai County, Zhejiang, were like this, and the masses said that this was "organized, but there was no mutual aid."

    The above-mentioned actions of greed for quantity and speed, blindly setting up stalls, and attacking individual farmers are obviously violations of the Party Central Committee's resolution on mutual aid and cooperation, and behaviors that frustrate the peasants' enthusiasm for production. According to the development law of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it must be from small to large, from few to many, and from low-level to high-level. The public fund of the mutual aid group should also be accumulated slowly, and must increase slowly with the increase in the income of the group members; the degree of socialization of the means of production should also be based on the voluntary will of the masses and the needs of production development. If not, fantasizing about transforming the peasants' private ownership into public ownership one morning will only destroy agricultural production. It must be understood: The standard of good or bad mutual aid and cooperation is not reflected in the superficial excitement, but in the fact that the peasant members of the mutual aid group produce more grain and increase their income than individual households. Because the purpose of organizing is to increase production and improve the material and cultural life of the peasants. The Party Central Committee has clearly pointed out: "Increasing the income of general members is the standard for checking the work of any mutual aid group and production cooperative." Therefore, we must always focus on the immediate interests of the peasants when leading the peasants to take the road of cooperation and mutual aid. If we disregard the actual interests of the masses and focus on superficial ostentation, and actually make the people who participate in the cooperative bear a body of debt, this will not only fail to attract the masses to participate in the cooperative, but will also scare away the peasants, damage the masses' trust in the agricultural production cooperative, and create difficulties for the work of continuing to guide the peasants to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation in the future.

    The Party Central Committee pointed out: The enthusiasm shown by the peasants on the basis of land reform is manifested in two aspects: one is the enthusiasm for labor mutual aid; the other is the enthusiasm for individual economy. These two aspects of enthusiasm are important factors in restoring and developing the national economy. The Party's policy is to "promote organization" while also taking care of the enthusiasm of individual farmers. That is to say, on the one hand, we should actively lead the peasants to organize themselves, and must resolutely oppose the tendency of spontaneous flow, so as to complete the socialist transformation through mutual aid and cooperation. This is the Party's basic policy in agricultural construction. It is not allowed to waver in this regard. But on the other hand, it is necessary to admit the necessity of protecting the enthusiasm of the individual economy, and it is not allowed to develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations by attacking individual farmers. However, many of our Party members and cadres have some misunderstandings in this regard. They only pay attention to the aspect of leading the peasants to organize themselves, but ignore the aspect of protecting the enthusiasm of the individual economy, and even treat individual farmers rudely, violating the Party Central Committee's policy of being active, cautious, and advancing steadily. According to the characteristics of small producers, any new reform in production and life must be accepted only after the peasants themselves have experienced it many times and know that it has benefits and no harm. Therefore, in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, we must be good at patiently educating the masses and waiting for the masses to become aware. Any impatient and impetuous ideas and practices will make great mistakes. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out: "We must fully, enthusiastically, and without barriers take care of, help, and patiently educate individual farmers, and must admit that their individual work is legal (as stipulated by the Common Program and the Land Reform Law). Do not ridicule them, do not scold them for being backward, and it is even more not allowed to use threats and restrictions to attack them." Because "our concern and appropriate care for individual farmers now may enable these individual farmers to gradually join the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the future, and it is also possible to realize our ultimate goal in the countryside—to guide all peasants to socialism and communism."

    However, up to now, many of our rural Party members and district and township cadres cannot distinguish between the Party and the non-Party, cannot distinguish between the present and the future, cannot distinguish between the Party's highest program and today's specific policies, and cannot distinguish between the difference between the vanguard and the reserve. Therefore, when carrying out the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, they rely on a burst of enthusiasm and move forward courageously, resulting in detours in their work. In order to thoroughly correct the impatient and impetuous mood of rural Party members in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it is necessary to use all methods to improve the policy level of Party members, and earnestly study the Party Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and the instructions on spring plowing production. Regarding this point, all central bureaus have instructed Party committees at all levels: A certain amount of time must be set aside for the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production", "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Spring Plowing Production" and the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production" published in the People's Daily on March 26, and these documents must be carefully read, discussed, and combined with the actual work of the locality for inspection, and practical and effective improvement measures must be formulated so that all district and village cadres can work correctly in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions. We believe that leading all Party members to earnestly study the Party's policies and deeply understand the spirit of the Party Central Committee is the key to ensuring the steady progress of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Our rural Party organizations and peasant Party members are the organizers who directly lead rural production and construction. Our every move has a great impact on the peasant masses. Therefore, for things that our Party members do not understand, we must delve into them, understand them, and then do them steadily, do not act according to conjecture, and even more cannot act blindly. As for things that our Party members already understand, but the peasant masses do not yet understand, we should patiently educate the masses, wait for the masses to become aware, and do not forcibly "take the lead" and force the masses to follow suit. It should be known that if the vanguard once leaves the masses it leads, and goes too far and too fast, it will inevitably form an isolated advance that is detached from the position, which is very dangerous. It must be pointed out that in recent years, many of our mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, under the correct leadership of the rural Party organizations and the exemplary actions of the Communist Party members, have indeed produced more grain, improved their lives, strengthened the concept of collective labor, and developed the enthusiasm of peasants for labor mutual aid. Therefore, when studying the Party's policies and inspecting mutual aid and cooperation work in various places, we must treat the current mutual aid and cooperation work with a realistic attitude and an active and cautious spirit. Do not simply point out deviations, scold everything, and deny everything; thinking that everything in the past was wrong, then reorganize or disband everything indiscriminately; nor can we just let the mistakes go and ignore them. Instead, we must specifically analyze the situation of different societies and groups, affirm the achievements, correct the shortcomings, and point out the direction. When correcting shortcomings, we may encounter resistance from some rural Party members and non-Party activists, because they were once active promoters in organizing mutual aid groups and cooperatives. Once the shortcomings are corrected, some of them may not be able to figure it out for a while. Today, we must persuade the activists, unite them, and lead the masses to make corrections with them, and should not attribute the responsibility for the mistakes to rural Party members and district and township cadres. Instead, we should explain the causes and conditions of the mistakes, and put forward methods for correction. We should praise those who have done well and encourage everyone to continue to move forward. It must be explained that it is not that mutual aid and cooperation itself is not good, but that there are shortcomings in leadership. Once the shortcomings are improved, everything will be fine. If we give up because there are shortcomings, it is very wrong. The practice of Dagang Village in Jilin in correcting deviations is relatively correct. During the slack season last year, the village turned 71 mutual aid groups into 24 large groups at once, and also established 10 public property groups. Many of these groups were forcibly established by a few activists; when they began to correct the shortcomings this year, some Party members and cadres pessimistically said: "It's over, a thousand days of firewood, one day of burning, it's all in vain." In order to ensure that the organization of mutual aid and cooperation can continue to move forward after a rectification without causing ideological confusion, the county and district leading cadres adopted a focused approach to rectification. First, they selected a typical group to patiently help them study policies, summarize experiences and lessons, understand the masses' reactions to running large groups, and study why some people are unwilling to run large groups. Next, the district and village cadres reviewed their "greatness and joy" thinking, thinking that "anyway, more is better than less," and did not decide on the development of mutual aid groups based on production needs and the level of awareness of the masses. At this time, the county and district leading cadres attending the meeting emphasized that the policy of "organizing" was correct, and the problem was that the methods were wrong. This inspired everyone to study the correct solutions, such as the fact that the groups that were originally merged into large groups are now still scattered into small groups in accordance with the principle of voluntary will and taking into account the leadership ability of the group leaders; the vehicles and horses that were originally valued as public property are now still owned by individuals. At the same time, a fair and reasonable scoring and work recording system was formulated, which stabilized the mood of the masses and improved the enthusiasm for labor mutual aid. On the other hand, there are also cases where ideological confusion is caused by rashness. For example, the Ma Biao agricultural production cooperative in Shentang Village, Qi County, Shanxi, was originally established under the order of the county cadres. They had said to the Party members: "Those who do not take the lead in joining the cooperative are not worthy of being a Communist Party member, and your Party membership should be considered." As a result, 12 of the 13 Party members in the village joined the cooperative. This time, the higher authorities called for rectifying the cooperative, and the district committee sent Comrade Sun Buting to correct the deviations. Because Sun Buting had not studied the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies, he did not know how to correct the shortcomings. As soon as he arrived in the village, he convened a meeting of cooperative members and announced the suspension of the cooperative, saying: "Forcing people to join the cooperative violates the principle of voluntariness, and livestock joining the cooperative infringes on private ownership. Those who do not want to be in the cooperative can leave the cooperative and take back their livestock to feed themselves." As a result, the specific problems within the cooperative were not solved, and what to do after the agricultural production cooperative was suspended was not mentioned, leaving the Party members in the village at a loss and depressed. This is a noteworthy example. When correcting deviations in various places, we must carefully study the Party Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, we must carefully summarize the specific experience of the locality, and we must advocate and commend the examples of those who have done well, giving everyone a model to learn from. Resolutely prevent going from one deviation to another.

### 党的组织必须学习党的互助合作政策纠正急躁冒进，积极稳步继续前进

    党的组织必须学习党的互助合作政策纠正急躁冒进，积极稳步继续前进
    在全国广大农村里，凡是受过整党教育的共产党员，一般地都懂得我们党领导革命的最终目的是要在中国实行共产主义制度，懂得在今天只有积极地引导广大农民“组织起来”，经过互助合作的道路才能到达社会主义和最后达到共产主义社会。所以许多党员在整党以后，转变了过去不参加、不领导互助合作运动的消极态度，积极地参加了互助合作组织。在整党后，山东省三千八百四十七个支部中，党员参加互助组的平均数比以前增加了一倍，在互助合作组织比较有基础的地方，党员已普遍加入了互助合作组织，一般地区有百分之六十左右的党员加入了互助合作组织。农村互助合作运动呈现了蓬勃发展的新气象，对于恢复与发展农业生产，减轻群众经济痛苦，发挥了巨大作用，这是农村整党后的主要情况。
    但是，在整党中，由于某些农村党的领导组织对党的互助合作政策教育做得不够，因而有些基层党的组织和共产党员不懂得领导农民互助合作的工作，一定要从当前小农经济分散和私有的现状出发，不懂得党团结劳动农民稳步前进的互助合作政策，不懂得共产党员在互助合作运动中怎样发挥先锋作用；因而过去已经存在的急躁冒进情绪，在整党以后依然存在，有的地方甚至还有发展。这具体表现在以下几个方面：
    一种表现是贪多图快。认为互助合作组织“搞得多”，“搞得大”，“搞得快”，才能表现党员的先锋作用。因而他们不顾群众的实际要求和觉悟程度，主观地提出“联、并、跳”的口号，幻想一下子把群众都编到互助组里来，一下子把所有的互助组都“跳”到农业生产合作社去。有的季节性临时性的互助组还没有办好，就想成立常年互助组；有的根本没有经过互助组的准备步骤，就直接搞农业生产合作社。他们错误地认为搞农业生产合作社比互助组“省事”得多。还有的人用盲目扩大“公有财产”的办法去创造“高级形式”。辽西省北镇二区二百十一个公有牲口组，有一半是在整党中建立或扩大起来的。很多党员说：早互助，晚互助，早晚得互助；迟“社会”，早“社会”，早晚得进“社会”（指社会主义）。因此结论是：“迟不如早，早不如快”；有的村杀猪买酒，吃大锅饭，有的还悬挂大旗，写着“为集体农庄而奋斗”。山东恩县一区有一个农业生产合作社发展到一百二十户，河北省有的农业生产合作社发展到四百余户。有的地方由于盲目扩大组织，大大加重了农民群众的负担。如黑龙江海伦区济民村团结屯祁景春、柳春林两个大组，把全组组员车马作价归公，按股分红，甚至按地摊钱，祁景春组每垧地摊七十万元，柳春林组每垧地摊八十五万元。另外还从供销合作社赊购胶皮车，欠款两千万元。这些摊款、欠债，都要组员来负担，结果，大家意见很多，影响了生产的积极性。
    另一种表现是盲目摆摊子，认为“要办农业生产合作社，首先就得修个饭厅、托儿所、办公室、俱乐部等等”。黑龙江瞻榆县李振山农业生产合作社原来基础很差，全社十三户中大部分是单干户和临时互助组的组员，在建立合作社时，群众就不同意，县委却盲目支持这个社，扩大公共财产，不只是新打一眼井，买了两匹马、四台大车、三台铲趟机和一台水磨；而且还买了两台缝纫机，又修了十四间新房子。除了干部宿舍、机器房、粮食仓库、厨房、马棚以外，还有缝纫室、饭厅兼俱乐部等。算起来这些花费占了全社农业和副业收入的百分之三十一点五。他们在农忙季节抽出了四个妇女去学机器缝纫，准备统一给全社社员做衣服。因为摊子太大，债务又多，社员劳动一年，不仅分不到粮食，反而每人要倒贴十一石七斗二升粮食。因此，有的社员反映：“新道路好是好，就是走不起。”
    再一种表现是打击单干农民。他们给单干农民乱戴帽子，说单干农民是“落后分子，自私自利”，是“走资本主义道路”；有的甚至用经济封锁和精神压力的作法对待单干农民，不让单干农民向互助组借农具，不许单干农户参加丰产评比会。甚至有的当面威吓单干农户说：“现在不参加，以后也不许参加。”河北大名县堤上村干部在街上摆了两个桌子，向农民说：社会主义和资本主义是两条道路，愿走社会主义道路的就签名。有的村里开会演戏，把农业生产合作社的社员排在前面，要单干农户退到后边去，公开骂单干农民是“单干坯”，是“走死亡路线”。有些单干农民受不了讽刺打击，感到“低人一等”，被迫参加了互助组，因此有的地方就出现了“明互助暗不互助”的现象。浙江临海县大田乡六十一个互助组中就有十二个是这样，群众说这是“组织起来了，但没有互助”。
    上述这种贪多图快、盲目摆摊子和打击单干农民的举动，显然是违反党中央互助合作决议，挫折农民生产积极性的行为。按照互助合作运动的发展规律，必须是由小到大，由少到多，由低级到高级。互助组的公有基金也应慢慢积累，一定要随着组员收入增加的程度慢慢增加；生产资料的社会化的程度也应根据群众的自愿和生产发展需要。如果不是这样，幻想一个早上就把农民的私有制转变为公有制，结果只会破坏了农业生产。必须了解：互助合作的好坏标准，不是表现在表面上的热闹，而是表现在互助组的农民组员比单干户多产粮食，收入增加。因为组织起来的目的是为了增加生产、改善农民物质文化生活。党中央曾明确指出：“增加一般成员的收入，这是检查任何互助组和生产合作社的工作好坏的标准。”因此，我们领导农民走合作互助的道路，一定要时时刻刻从农民切身利益着眼，如果不顾群众的实际利益，一心在表面上搞排场，而实际上使参加合作社的人负了一身债务。这就不仅不能吸引群众参加合作社而且会吓退了农民，损害群众对农业生产合作社的信任，给以后继续引导农民走互助合作道路的工作造成困难。
    党中央指出：农民在土地改革基础上所发挥的积极性表现在两个方面：一方面是劳动互助的积极性；另一方面是个体经济的积极性，这两方面的积极性是恢复和发展国民经济的重要因素，党的政策是“提倡组织起来”同时也照顾到单干农户的积极性。这就是说，我们一方面应当积极地领导农民组织起来，必须坚决反对自流倾向，以便经过互助合作完成社会主义的改造，这是党在农业建设方面的基本方针。在这方面，发生动摇是不允许的。但在另一方面必须承认保护个体经济的积极性的必要，不许以打击单干农民办法来发展互助合作组织。可是，我们不少的党员干部恰恰在这一方面发生一些误解，他们只注意了领导农民组织起来的一面，而忽视了保护个体经济积极性的一面，甚至粗暴地对待单干农民，违反党中央积极慎重，稳步前进的方针。根据小生产者的特点，凡是对于生产和生活方面任何一种新的改革，都是要经过农民自身多次体验，确实知道有好处无害处的时候，才能接受。因此，在互助合作运动中，我们必须善于耐心地教育群众，等待群众觉悟，任何急躁冒进的想法和作法都要犯很大的错误。党中央一再指出：“要充分地满腔热情地没有隔阂地去照顾、帮助和耐心地教育单干农民，必须承认他们的单干是合法的（为共同纲领和土地改革法所规定），不要讥笑他们，不要骂他们落后，更不允许采用威胁和限制的方法打击他们。”因为“我们在现在表示关心和适当地照顾单干农民，就有可能使这些单干农民在将来逐步地加入互助合作组织，也就有可能实现我们在农村中的最后目的——引导全体农民走向社会主义和共产主义。”
    可是，到现在为止，我们有不少农村党员和区乡干部分不清党内和党外，分不清现在和将来，分不清党的最高纲领和今天的具体政策，分不清先锋队和后备队的差别。因此，在执行上级任务时，凭着一股热情，勇往直前，结果使工作走了弯路。为了彻底纠正农村党员在互助合作运动中的急躁冒进情绪，必须用一切方法提高党员政策水平，认真学习党中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议和春耕生产的指示。关于这点，各中央局均已指示各级党委：对三月二十六日人民日报发表的党中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”、“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”和人民日报社论“领导农业生产的关键所在”，必须划出一定时间，精读这些文件，展开讨论，并结合当地实际工作进行检查，订出切实有效的改进办法，使所有区、村干部都能正确根据中央指示的精神进行工作。我们认为领导全体党员认真学习党的政策，深切体会党中央的精神，是保证互助合作运动稳步前进的关键。我们农村党组织和农民党员是直接领导农村生产建设的组织者，我们的一举一动，给农民群众的影响很大。因此，凡是我们党员不懂的事，一定要钻进去弄懂了以后稳稳当当地去做，不要根据想当然来办事，更不能盲目行动。至于我们党员已经懂得的事，而农民群众还不懂的时候，则应该耐心地教育群众，等待群众觉悟，不要硬行“带头”，逼迫群众照办。应该知道：如果先锋队一旦离开了它所带领的群众，走得太远太快了，势必形成脱离阵地的孤军冒进，这是十分危险的。必须指出：几年来，我们有不少的互助组和农业生产合作社在农村党组织的正确领导和共产党员的模范行动带领下，确实多打了粮食，改善了生活，加强了集体劳动的观念，发展了农民劳动互助的积极性，因此，各地在学习党的政策，检查互助合作工作时，要以实事求是的态度和积极慎重的精神对待当前互助合作工作，不要单纯地指出偏差，骂倒一切，否定一切；以为过去一切都错了，就不分青红皂白地一律改组或解散；也不能将错就错，置之不理。而是要根据不同的社、组的情况，具体分析，肯定成绩，纠正缺点，指出方向。在纠正缺点时可能会遇到某些农村党员和非党积极分子的抵触情绪，因为在组织互助组和合作社时，他们曾是积极的推动者，一旦纠正缺点，他们中有的人一时还会想不通。今天，我们必须说服积极分子，团结好他们，和他们一道去领导群众进行改正，不应该把错的责任都归到农村党员和区乡干部身上。而应该说明犯错误的原因和条件，提出纠正的办法，应该表扬做得好的，鼓励大家继续前进。必须说明：并不是互助合作本身不好，而是领导方面有缺点，改进了缺点，一切就会好起来的。如果因为有缺点，就撤手不干了，这是很不对的。吉林大岗村对纠正偏向的做法还是比较正确的。该村在去年挂锄期间，一下子把七十一个互助小组变成了二十四个大组，还搞了十个公有财产组。其中有不少的组是由少数积极分子强迫搞起来的；今年开始纠正缺点时，就有些党员干部这样悲观地说：“完了，千日打柴一日烧，白费力气了。”县、区领导干部为使互助合作的组织经过一次整顿后确实能够继续前进，而不致引起思想混乱，就采取有重点的着手整顿。首先选择一个典型组耐心地帮助他们学习政策，总结经验教训，了解群众对办大组有那些反映，研究为什么有些人不愿意办大组。接着，区、村干部检讨了“好大喜功”的思想，以为“反正多了比少了强”，而没有根据生产需要和群众觉悟程度来决定互助组的发展。这时，参加会议的县区领导干部着重指出“组织起来”的方针是正确的，问题在于做法有毛病。从而启发大家研究正确的解决办法，譬如原来并成大组的，现在按照群众自愿原则并照顾组长领导能力仍旧分散成小组；原来把车马作价归公的，现在仍归个人所有。同时，订出公平合理的评分记工制度，这就稳定了群众情绪，提高了劳动互助的积极性。另一方面也有因为草率从事，引起思想混乱的。例如：山西祁县神堂村马彪农业生产合作社原来是在县的干部命令下建立起来的。他们曾向党员说：“谁不带头入社，就不够一个共产党员，要考虑你们的党籍。”于是全村十三个党员就有十二个入社。这次上级号召整顿合作社，区委派了孙步庭同志去纠正偏向。由于孙步庭没有学过党的互助合作政策，因而也就不懂得怎样纠正缺点。他一到村里就召集社员大会，宣布停止办社，说：“强迫入社违背了自愿原则，牲口入社侵犯了私有，不愿在社的出社，拉回牲口自己喂。”结果，社内具体问题没有解决，停办生产合作社以后怎办也没有提及，弄得村里的党员无所适从，情绪低落。这是值得注意的一个例子。各地在纠正偏向时，一定要好好学习党中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议，一定要好好总结当地的具体经验，要提倡和表扬做得好的例子，给大家以学习的榜样。切实防止从一个偏向又走上另一个偏向。
