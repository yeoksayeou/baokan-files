    The United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, illegally passed the US proposal to impose an "embargo" on the People's Republic of China on May 18, 1951. Facts over the past two years have proven that due to the United States' forceful implementation of the "embargo" policy, the economies of Southeast Asian countries, which have long and close trade relations with China, have suffered severe damage. The United States has used this policy in an attempt to further enslave the people of Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, the sentiment of the broad masses of people of all strata in this region against the US "embargo" policy is growing stronger.

    After the "embargo" was passed, the United States quickly took advantage of its position as the main buyer of raw materials produced by Southeast Asian countries and began to adopt various malicious means to lower the prices of various raw materials, especially rubber and tin, in order to further plunder these important strategic raw materials and extract maximum profits. In order to lower the price of natural rubber, the United States expanded its synthetic rubber production and subsidized it, making the price of synthetic rubber lower than the price of natural rubber. It also restricted the consumption of natural rubber by American factories, while reducing and refusing to purchase certain natural rubber from Southeast Asia. As a result, the price of natural rubber began to plummet shortly after the "embargo" was passed, from a peak of 2.40 Malayan dollars per pound in the second half of 1951 to a record low of 65 cents per pound in early April of this year, a drop of almost three-quarters. In order to lower the price of tin, the United States adopted tactics such as "boycotts" and separate agreements with major tin-producing countries to purchase tin over the long term. As a result, the price of tin also quickly fell from 780 Malayan dollars per picul to about 440 Malayan dollars per picul in early April of this year. These price drops of raw materials have enabled American monopoly capital to extract greater profits. The US Senate Tin Subcommittee admitted that American monopoly capitalists gained an additional $500 million in profits simply due to the drop in tin prices from April to August 1951.

    The drop in raw material prices has severely damaged the overall economy of Southeast Asian countries, which rely on the export of raw materials as their main source of income. This is most evident in the deterioration of these countries' foreign trade. For example, comparing the foreign trade figures for 1951 and 1952, Malaya went from a surplus of more than 1.27 billion Malayan dollars to a deficit of 52 million Malayan dollars; Indonesia went from a surplus of 1.3 billion guilders (currency name) to a deficit of more than 1.636 billion guilders; Thailand went from a surplus of more than 937 million baht (currency name) to a deficit of 1 billion baht; and Ceylon went from a surplus of 346 million rupees (currency name) to a deficit of 205 million rupees.

    On the one hand, Southeast Asian countries' income has been greatly reduced due to the drop in raw material prices; on the other hand, they have been forced by the United States to "absorb" a large amount of American dumped goods. Under this double plunder, they have suffered a serious "dollar shortage," a sharp decline in foreign exchange and monetary reserves, inflation, and an increase in national fiscal deficits. Between July 1951 and July 1952, Indonesia's monetary reserves decreased by 26 percent, and Thailand's decreased by 18 percent. Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of 1952 were $152 million less than at the end of 1951. Indonesia's fiscal deficit at the end of 1951 was 4 billion guilders, which increased to 4.3 billion guilders in 1952. In Thailand's 1953 budget, the deficit reached 1.0098 billion baht. Between August and December 1952 alone, the Thai government issued an additional 70 million baht in banknotes. According to statistics, as of the end of October 1952, the British colonial government of the Federation of Malaya was already in debt to the tune of more than 263 million dollars. In the 1953 fiscal year, the Federation of Malaya government's deficit reached more than 97 million dollars. The amount of currency in circulation in Malaya increased by more than 61 million dollars in 1952 compared to 1951.

    On the other hand, the "embargo" policy's negative effect on the economies of Southeast Asian countries is also reflected in the decline in raw material production, the decline in industry and commerce, and the increase in unemployment in these countries. Malaya's rubber and tin production in 1952 both decreased compared to 1951, with rubber production falling to its lowest level since 1946. In Singapore alone, 846 stores closed in 1952, and 25 limited companies went out of business, the highest number since the war. Due to the drop in rubber prices, more than 100 rubber plantations and rubber processing factories in southern Thailand stopped production. Most of the rubber processing factories in Indonesia were in a state of semi-shutdown in 1952. According to the materials of the "Indonesian Employment Agency" alone, the number of unemployed in Indonesia increased from more than 256,000 in 1951 to more than 295,000 in 1952.

    The facts of economic deterioration clearly manifested in all aspects, and the direct experience of feeling the increasing difficulties in daily life, have made the broad masses of people of all strata in Southeast Asian countries increasingly dissatisfied with the US "embargo" policy. The Indonesian "Eternal Daily" said that the US "embargo" policy is to make itself the only major buyer of rubber in the world who can arbitrarily set buying prices. "The embargo" is only beneficial to the United States and not to other countries. Suyonikoro, Secretary-General of the Indonesian National Enterprises Federation, said that the Indonesian business community has become silent due to the "embargo." A lot of civilian rubber has accumulated in Indonesia. Therefore, "trading with China and selling Indonesia's civilian rubber is beneficial to Indonesians." According to the Singapore "Straits Times," "the Singapore trade community is increasingly dissatisfied with the embargo." The Malayan business community believes that trade with China "is an important step in resolving Malaya's current economic crisis." Suri Tongwanit, a Thai peace delegate and editor of the "Thai Voice" who attended the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, said that the "embargo" has caused difficulties for the broad masses of people in Thailand, with large numbers of workers unemployed and rubber plantation owners bankrupt. The Thai people demand the lifting of the "embargo" so that the people of all countries can conduct trade on the principles of freedom and equality. After the Ceylon government signed an equal and mutually beneficial trade agreement with China, despite the various despicable threats and sabotage tactics of the US government, people of all strata in Ceylon expressed warm welcome. Peter Keuneman, a member of the Ceylon Parliament representing the Ceylon Communist Party, issued a statement saying that this agreement is equal, honorable, and beneficial to the people of Ceylon. The people of Ceylon will never allow the United States to undermine Ceylon's opportunity to obtain food, friendship, and beneficial trade. The "Ceylon Times" said that Sino-Ceylon trade not only provides Ceylon with a large amount of food, but also guarantees a large sales market for Ceylon's products. The municipal councils of various towns in Ceylon and the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce have also expressed their opposition to the US "embargo" policy and welcomed the signing of trade agreements with China.

    美国“禁运”政策严重损害东南亚各国经济
    东南亚各国人民要求自由平等地进行贸易
    【新华社十七日讯】一九五一年五月十八日，联合国大会在美国操纵下非法通过对中华人民共和国实行“禁运”的美国提案。两年来的事实证明：由于美国强制实行“禁运”政策，和中国有长久密切贸易关系的东南亚各国经济，遭受到了严重的损害；美国利用了这种政策，企图进一步奴役东南亚国家人民。因此，这个地区的各阶层广大人民反对美国“禁运”政策的情绪正越来越高涨。
    “禁运”案通过后，美国很快就利用它是东南亚国家所产原料的主要买主的优势地位，开始采取种种恶毒手段，压低各种原料首先是橡胶和锡的价格，以便进一步掠夺这些重要战略原料，榨取最大利润。为了压低天然胶的价格，美国扩大它的人造胶生产，加以津贴，而使人造胶价格低于天然胶价格，并限制美国工厂的天然胶消费量，同时又减购和拒购东南亚的某种天然胶。结果，天然胶价格就在“禁运”案通过后不久开始直线降落，从一九五一年下半年最高峰时的价格每磅马来亚币二元四角，跌到今年四月初每磅六角五分的最低纪录，几乎跌了四分之三。为了压低锡的价格，美国采取了
    “罢购”以及分别和主要产锡国家签订长期购买协定的各个击破办法等手段。结果锡价也很快从每担马来亚币七百八十元跌到今年四月初的每担四百四十元左右。这些原料的跌价，使美国垄断资本榨取到更大的利润。美参议院锡小组委员会承认，仅仅由于一九五一年四月到八月的锡价跌落，美国垄断资本家就多得了五亿美元利润。
    原料跌价使依靠输出原料为主要收入的东南亚国家的整个经济受到了严重的损害。这最明显地表现在这些国家对外贸易情况的恶化上面。如以一九五一年和一九五二年的对外贸易数字来比较，马来亚从出超马来亚币十二亿七千多万元变为入超五千二百万元；印尼从出超十三亿盾（货币名）变为入超十六亿三千六百多万盾；泰国从出超九亿三千七百多万铢（货币名）变为入超十亿铢；锡兰从出超三亿四千六百万卢比（货币名）变为入超二亿零五百万卢比。
    东南亚国家一方面因为原料跌价而收入大大减少，另一方面又受美国强制大量“吸收”美国的倾销商品，在这双重掠夺下，因而就发生严重的“美元荒”，外汇和货币准备金激减，通货膨胀，国家财政赤字增加。从一九五一年七月到一九五二年七月的一年之间，印尼的货币准备金减少了百分之二十六，泰国减少了百分之十八。印尼在一九五二年底的外汇积存额比一九五一年底减少了一亿五千二百万美元。印尼在一九五一年底的财政赤字为四十亿盾，一九五二年又增加到四十三亿盾。泰国一九五三年度预算中，赤字达十亿零九千八百万铢。单在一九五二年八月到十二月之间，泰国政府就增发纸币七千万铢。据统计，截至一九五二年十月底止，马来亚联合邦英殖民政府已经负债二亿六千三百多万元。在一九五三会计年度中，马来亚联合邦政府赤字达九千七百多万元。马来亚的货币流通额，一九五二年比一九五一年增加六千一百多万元。
    另一方面，“禁运”政策使东南亚国家经济情况恶化也表现在这些国家的原料产量低降、工商业凋敝和失业人数增加上面。马来亚一九五二年的橡胶和锡产量都比一九五一年减少，橡胶产量并降到一九四六年以来的最低水平。单在新加坡一地，一九五二年关闭的商店就有八百四十六家，已经歇业的有限公司二十五家，为战后以来的最高数目。由于橡胶跌价，泰国南部停止生产的橡胶园和橡胶加工工厂有一百多个。印尼橡胶加工工厂在一九五二年大部分都陷入半停顿状态。仅据“印尼职业介绍所”的材料，印尼失业人数已由一九五一年的二十五万六千多人增加到一九五二年的二十九万五千多人。
    明显地表现在各方面的经济情况恶化的事实，以及在日常生活中日感困难的切身体验，使东南亚国家各阶层广大人民对于美国“禁运”政策越来越表示不满。印尼“永恒报”说，美国的“禁运”政策是为了使它自己成为随意定出买价的世界唯一橡胶大买主。“禁运”只对美国有利，对其他国家都没有好处。印尼民族企业联合机构秘书长苏约尼哥罗说，印尼的商场已因“禁运”而变得沉寂。印尼民间已经堆积了很多存胶。因此，“和中国通商，卖出印尼的民间存胶是对印尼人有利的。”据新加坡“海峡时报”报道，“新加坡贸易界对于禁运日感不满”，马来亚实业界认为，和中国贸易“是解决马来亚目前经济危机的一个重要步骤”。出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的泰国和平代表、“泰声报”编辑?素里·通哇匿说，“禁运”使泰国广大人民遭遇到困难，大批工人失业，树胶园主破产。泰国人民要求取消“禁运”，让各国人民在自由平等原则下进行贸易。锡兰政府不顾美国政府的种种卑劣的威胁破坏手段，和中国签订平等互利的贸易协定以后，锡兰各阶层人民表示热烈欢迎。锡兰议会议员彼得·克尼曼代表锡兰共产党发表声明说，这个协定是平等、光荣、对锡兰人民有利的。锡兰人民决不能容许美国来破坏锡兰获得粮食、友谊和有利贸易的机会。“锡兰时报”说，中锡贸易不仅使锡兰获得大量粮食，而且保证锡兰产品得到广大的销售市场。锡兰各市镇参议会和锡兰商会也都表示反对美国“禁运”政策，欢迎和中国签订贸易协定。
