From the 21st to the 24th, the city was filled with a joyous festive atmosphere. People wore beautiful summer clothes and enthusiastically participated in various celebrations in the green *linkas* (parks) and the newly built auditorium in the city. In the past few days, people have held grand celebration meetings, symposiums, and soirees, screened movies, and published Tibetan-language celebration wall newspapers. Officials of the Tibetan local government and people from all walks of life also wrote articles in the Tibetan "News Briefs" to express their feelings. The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa held a swearing-in ceremony before the festival, writing to Chairman Mao to express their determination to build Tibet for a long time and consolidate the national defense.

Officials of the Tibetan local government, cultural and educational circles in Lhasa, parents of students, the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, and the preparatory committee of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Association have all held symposiums and celebration banquets. People who participated in the symposiums used their personal experiences to describe the achievements of the implementation of the agreement in the past two years.

Che Ren·Renqin Zhuoma, a teacher at the cadre school of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said at the meeting: "It has only been two years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, but under the leadership and help of the Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we Tibetan people have made remarkable achievements in economic and cultural construction. We have deeply realized the determination of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to serve the Tibetan people for a long time." Zhan Dong, a *kanqiong* (fourth-rank monk official) of the Tibetan local government, said: "The signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet is like the radiant light of the morning sun shining all over Tibet, making the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama as harmonious as water and milk, and making Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce develop like the sea." Apé·Dima Yuzhen, a representative of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, said: "We Tibetan youths must further study the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and scientific knowledge, and contribute our strength to the thorough implementation of this agreement."
