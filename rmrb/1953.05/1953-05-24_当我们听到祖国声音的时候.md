To the beloved announcers of the Central People's Broadcasting Station:

Your clear voices travel over mountains and rivers, reaching the front lines of the fighting in Korea, reaching our quiet hospital wards where we are recuperating in the motherland. From the broadcasts, we have become familiar with your voices. For more than two years, whether in battle or recuperation, your voices, no, the voice of the motherland has given us so much comfort and warmth, given us so much enlightenment and strength! How can we not thank you, thank all the comrades engaged in the motherland's broadcasting事业!

After entering Korea, we fought alongside the Korean People's Army. Only after defeating several frenzied enemy offensives did we have the conditions to listen to broadcasts from the motherland. When we first heard the heartening sound of "Central People's Broadcasting Station..." on the Korean front lines, you can imagine how happy everyone was! It was like hearing the voice of a long-lost mother. Everyone listened intently, carefully placing their hands on the radio, as if stroking a loved one. Everyone suppressed the sound of their own breathing, trying to reduce it to the faintest level. But when we heard the resounding song, "Sing of our dear motherland, marching towards prosperity and strength...", who could restrain the intense beating of their hearts caused by excitement? When we heard the sound of "Whoever dares to invade us will be met with death...", it was as if we heard the exhortations of a loving mother, and also as if we heard the orders of the people of the motherland.... We lovingly moved our hands from the radio, straightened our chests, stepped out of the shelters, widened our eyes, clenched our fists, and looked towards Beijing – the beating heart of the motherland from which the songs emanated. We silently swore to the motherland: "We will answer your hopes with battle."

From then on, we never missed any possible opportunity to listen. From the broadcasts, we heard Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's order to all commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: "Study diligently and master new technologies without complacency… strive to build a strong and modern national defense force!" We also heard the speech by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee: "If you want men, stand up and go; if you want money, if you want grain, send it immediately!”; we also heard people's accusations against American bacteriological warfare criminals and the common voices of people all over the world: strive for people's democracy, strive for lasting peace....

We have heard the tsunami-like cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" in front of Tiananmen Square more than once! We seemed to see the fireworks in the capital's festive night sky, and the smiling faces of countless revelers. The magnificent and brilliant lights illuminated our hearts; the youthful songs drowned out the sound of dripping water in the tunnels.

Sometimes, when we heard the clear voices of children on the radio shouting "Volunteer Army Uncle," those "little devils" on the front lines would crawl in front of the radio, smiling and saying: "Comrade, how can I be your uncle? Just call me big brother! It's the same anyway, I want to protect you, I want to protect you with all my strength!" The hearts of the children melted together at the same time.

This spring, I was wounded in a battle in Korea and sent back to a hospital in the country to recuperate. Here, there is no roar of artillery, no sound of enemy planes diving, only a tranquil sanatorium environment, careful diagnosis by doctors, and attentive care from nurses. However, this kind of life is monotonous for the Volunteer Army soldiers who have been fighting on the Korean front for a long time. At this time, listening to your broadcasts has become an indispensable part of our daily life. From your voices, we learned about Premier Zhou Enlai's "Statement on the Korean Armistice Negotiations," we learned about the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, we learned about the successive victories on the Korean front, we learned about the soul-stirring heroic deeds of our comrades, and we learned about the achievements of the motherland's construction in all aspects. All of this further encouraged our determination to defend peace and defend the motherland, and further encouraged our desire to recuperate with peace of mind and strive to return to the team as soon as possible. Once, we heard the voice of Li Yujin, a student from the Affiliated Women's Middle School of Beijing Normal University, broadcasting to the Volunteer Army. Her first sentence, "Dear Volunteer Army Uncles, Big Brothers, Big Sisters...", made friendly smiles appear on the faces of many of us convalescents; when she shouted "Goodbye," many people shouted loudly: "What, it's over!" Comrades, you see, how much we need your voices, the voice of the motherland!

In the past few years, all aspects of the motherland have been changing, and your voices have also become stronger, more enthusiastic, and full of confidence and hope. In Beijing, you have finally shouted the most exciting slogan: The motherland's large-scale economic construction has begun! This is the hope of so many people, the dream of so many people! You see, the great Chinese people are about to take steps towards the socialist road. Hearing this news, we couldn't help but shout: "Forward, motherland!"

I wish you good health! I wish the motherland's broadcasting事业 further success!

### 当我们听到祖国声音的时候

专栏：

    当我们听到祖国声音的时候亲爱的中央人民广播电台播音员同志：
    你们的清朗的声音，越过千山万水，传到了战斗的朝鲜的前沿阵地，传到了我们在祖国休养的安静的病房。从广播中，我们熟悉了你们的声音。两年多来，不论在战斗和休养中，你们的声音，不，祖国的声音给了我们多少安慰和温暖，给了我们多少启示和力量啊！我们怎能不感谢你们，感谢所有从事祖国广播事业的同志们呢？
    进入朝鲜，我们和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打垮了敌人几次疯狂进犯以后，我们才有条件收听祖国的广播。当我们在朝鲜前线第一次听到“中央人民广播电台……”这振奋人心的声音的时候，你知道大家是多么高兴啊！那就像听到了久别的母亲的声音一样，大伙聚精会神地听着；把手小心翼翼地放在收音机上，就好像抚摸着自己的亲人一样。每一个人都抑制着自己呼吸的声音，尽量使它减弱到最轻微的程度。但是，当我们听到“歌唱我们亲爱的祖国，从今走向繁荣富强……”嘹亮的歌声时，谁能阻止住由于兴奋引起的内心激烈跳动呢？当我们听到“谁敢侵犯我们，就叫他死亡……”的声音时，我们好像听到了慈母的叮咛，又好像听到了祖国人民的命令……。我们爱恋地把手从收音机上移下来，挺直胸脯，走出了掩蔽部，睁大眼睛，捏紧拳头，遥望着北京——这发出歌声的祖国心脏。我们在向祖国默默地宣誓：“我们要用战斗来回答你的希望。”
    自此，我们从没有放掉过每一个可能收听的机会。从广播中，我们听到过朱总司令给中国人民解放军全体指战员的命令：“毫不满足地认真学习，熟练掌握新的技术，……为建设一支强大的现代化国防军而奋斗！”也听到过中国人民抗美援朝总会郭沫若主席的讲话：“要人，站起来就走；要钱，要粮，马上就送”；还听到过人们对美国细菌战犯的控诉以及全世界人民的共同呼声：争取人民民主，争取持久和平……。
    我们不止一次地听到过天安门前海啸一样的欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”我们好像看到了首都节日夜空的焰花，好像看到了无数狂欢歌舞者的笑脸。那辉煌灿烂的灯光，照亮了我们的心；青春的歌声，淹没了坑道里滴水的坠落声。
    有时，当我们听到广播中孩子们喊着“志愿军叔叔”清脆的声音时，那些在前线上的“小鬼”就会爬在收音机前，含着笑说：“同志，我怎么能当您的叔叔呢？还是叫我哥哥吧！反正一样，我要保卫你们，要全力保卫你们！”孩子们的心，在同一时间内融化在一块了。
    今年春季，我在朝鲜的一次战斗中负了伤，被送回到国内的医院里休养。这里，没有大炮的轰鸣，没有敌机的俯冲声，有的只是恬静的疗养环境，大夫的精心诊断，护士的殷勤照顾。可是，这种生活对长期战斗在朝鲜前线的志愿军战士来说是单调的。这时，收听你们的广播，就成了我们每天生活中不可缺少的一部分。从你们的声音里，我们知道了周恩来总理“关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明”，知道了交换病伤战俘的情况，知道了朝鲜前线的节节胜利，知道了战友们动人心魄的英雄事迹，知道了祖国各方面建设的成就。这一切，进一步鼓舞了我们保卫和平、保卫祖国的决心，进一步鼓舞了我们安心休养，争取早日归队的愿望。有一次，我们听到了北京师范大学附属女子中学李玉瑾同学给志愿军广播的声音。她的第一句话：“亲爱的志愿军叔叔，大哥哥，大姊姊们……”，就使我们多少休养员的脸上浮现出亲切的微笑；当她喊出“再见”的时候，很多人都大声叫道：“怎么，完啦！”同志们，您看，你们的声音，祖国的声音，对我们该是多么需要啊！
    几年来，祖国各方面都在变化着，你们的声音也变得更加坚强，热情，充满着信心和希望。在北京，你们终于喊出了令人最兴奋的口号：祖国大规模的经济建设开始了！这是多少人的希望，多少人的梦想啊！你们看，伟大的中国人民，将要向社会主义的大道开步走了。听到这个消息，我们都情不自禁地喊出：“前进吧，祖国！”
    祝你们身体健康！祝祖国的广播事业进一步的成功！
