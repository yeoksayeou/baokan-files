    On the Soviet State Apparatus
    By Ivanov, Soviet Union
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are successfully building a communist society. In fulfilling this historic task, the Soviet state is a powerful tool. The Party considers it its sacred duty to continuously and comprehensively consolidate our socialist state.

    The Soviet state fulfills the functions of economic organization and cultural education, protects public property from theft and waste, and defends the country from foreign military attacks. To successfully fulfill all these functions, a well-organized and flexible state apparatus is required. Guided by the scientific principles of state construction formulated by Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party has always shown special concern for consolidating the power of the Soviet state and perfecting the state apparatus.

    The Soviet state apparatus, which emerged from the destruction of the bourgeois state machinery as a result of the socialist revolution, differs fundamentally from the bourgeois state apparatus. The bourgeois state apparatus serves a minority of exploiters and stands in opposition to the people, who are its diametrically opposed enemy. The Soviet state apparatus is a truly people's apparatus, established by the people and executing the will of the people. The workers of our state apparatus are servants of the people.

    Comrade Stalin instructed that the Soviet state apparatus, in the deepest sense of the word, is composed of the Soviets plus millions of various Party and non-Party organizations. These organizations connect the Soviets with the lowest levels, combine the state apparatus with millions of the masses, and gradually eliminate the various obstacles that exist between the state apparatus and the residents.

    The content of state management in a socialist society is fundamentally different from that of bourgeois management. In capitalist countries, management is first and foremost the oppression of the masses. The bourgeois state, under conditions of capitalist private ownership and the unlimited rights of monopoly capital, cannot lead the economy. In the Soviet Union, state management includes all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life in the country, and it is a constructive force that mobilizes the masses to engage in communist construction.

    The Soviet state leads the socialist national economy, constantly cares for improving the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people, and safeguards socialist legality and domestic order. The mission of state apparatus workers is to protect the inviolable rights of Soviet citizens as stipulated in the Soviet Constitution. The glorious and significant task before them is to implement the policies of the Communist Party and the resolutions of the Soviet government, and to strive for the timely completion of plans for the development of industry, transportation, agriculture, trade, and culture.

    During the years of Soviet power, the state apparatus has been constantly improving along with the changing tasks and functions of the socialist state.

    The most important component of the Party's entire activity in strengthening and improving the state apparatus is the cultivation of working cadres who have mastered the art of management and possess specialized knowledge and administrative work experience. Cadres are the decisive force in leading the country. Making the work of the organs more perfect means improving management methods and resolutely combating various phenomena of bureaucracy, conservatism, and red tape.

    The measures consistently implemented by the Party and the government to continuously improve the state apparatus have promoted the successful resolution of economic and cultural construction problems. At present, the major and complex tasks facing the Soviet state, and thus also facing the state apparatus, require the implementation of many new measures to further improve the state apparatus.

    As these requirements matured, the Party and the government recently implemented a series of organizational measures to further improve the Soviet organs and strengthen state leadership and economic leadership. The Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the law on the reorganization of the ministries of the Soviet Union. The number of ministries has been greatly reduced, and each ministry unites the leadership of national economic and cultural departments of similar nature.

    The previously existing system of ministries and committees – which oversaw a narrower part of the work within individual sectors of the national economy and culture – no longer meets the requirements of communist construction under the current conditions. Before the reorganization, many economic and cultural sectors were managed by various ministries and agencies, creating artificial barriers and parallelism in work, making it difficult for similar enterprises to exchange experiences, dispersing cadres, and complicating inter-agency correspondence. All of this hindered the effective resolution of many of the most important economic and cultural construction problems.

    Simultaneously with the measures to merge the ministries, the powers of the ministers were expanded, and they were given full authority within the scope stipulated by the resolutions of the Soviet government to handle the materials and cash of their ministries and to resolve all major issues in the activities of the enterprises and agencies under their jurisdiction. The purpose of expanding the powers of the ministers is to increase their sense of responsibility for the undertakings entrusted to them, while ensuring timely solutions to economic problems related to the completion of the tasks of the ministries.

    The reorganization of the ministries and the increase in the powers of the ministers are aimed at bringing the state apparatus closer to the masses, streamlining the state apparatus, improving the level of leadership, making the management of the national economy and cultural sectors more effective and skilled, and ensuring the successful implementation of the policies formulated by the Party and the government.

    There have been major changes in the leadership of industry. Our Soviet industry is developing by leaps and bounds, the types are increasing, and the cooperation of socialist production is becoming increasingly widespread. Before the reorganization, many common problems occurred in enterprises of similar nature under the jurisdiction of different ministries, and the unified solution of these problems was hindered by inter-agency barriers.

    The merging of the ministries and the increase in the powers of the ministers bring the leadership closer to the factories, eliminating parallelism and excessive layers in the management of various industrial sectors. The further improvement of the leadership of industry will undoubtedly ensure that the work of industrial enterprises can be further improved, and that the tasks of increasing labor productivity, reducing product costs, and more fully utilizing the internal potential of enterprises can be completed more smoothly.

    In agriculture, the former Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Cotton Growing, Ministry of State Farms, Ministry of Agricultural Storage, and Ministry of Forestry have been merged into the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural Storage. The powers of the Minister of Agriculture and Agricultural Storage are broad, and their purpose is to make the leadership of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms more effective and flexible, and to enhance the role of agricultural organs in the struggle for the further upsurge of socialist agriculture.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet government pay great attention to the development of culture. Before the reorganization, many ministries and committees led various departments of cultural construction. This caused difficulties in the work, reduced the level of leadership, and hindered the rational use of cadres. There were serious shortcomings in the work of some ministries. For example, the 19th Party Congress severely criticized the former Ministry of Cinema, and the Party newspaper revealed major shortcomings in the radio industry. In order to more successfully complete the tasks of cultural construction, the Soviet Ministry of Culture was established.

    Improving the state apparatus and increasing the powers of the ministers means the further consolidation of one-man management and the improvement of the role of leaders. In the future, the management of a certain department of the national economy and culture will be concentrated in one ministry. The minister's responsibility for the rapid and correct completion of the country's tasks and plans has increased. Now, the success of the work depends to a greater extent on selecting the necessary cadres well, correctly distributing these cadres, and organizing the work of the organs within the ministry and the work of the enterprises well.

    The major reforms to the state apparatus taken at the right time were made possible because the Party cultivated and educated cadres with a high level of professional competence, who are politically mature, good at implementing the Party's policies, and who have mastered the art of leading the country. The reorganization of the ministries freed up a large number of experts who can go to strengthen grassroots organizations and to enterprises.

    Due to the reorganization of the ministries and the expansion of the powers of the ministers and leaders of various general administrative agencies, the work of educating all staff members of the education organs about their responsibility to the people has gained greater significance. This sense of responsibility is the spirit of being responsible for one's own work, for accurately and effectively completing the government's tasks, and for understanding the interests of the entire country.

    The reorganization of the state apparatus by the Party and the government and the great expansion of the powers of the ministers require strengthening the struggle against departmentalism and waste of materials and money in economic work, improving the organization of central and local economic, accounting, and inspection work, and strengthening the supervision of the activities of state and economic institutions.

    It is of particular importance to conduct systematic inspections of the following: inspecting the situation of enterprises, general administrative agencies, and ministries in implementing national economic plans, inspecting their use of existing production capacity and exploration of new production potential, complying with regulations to improve product quality, and completing the tasks of reducing costs and saving systems; it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of economic organizations with rubles to complete the situation of reducing costs and accumulating funds, and strengthen the supervision of unconditionally complying with national discipline.

    The measures to make the state apparatus more perfect enable the state to plan more flexibly with all possible means, and open up broader prospects for creative expression in exploring local resources and completing economic plans.

    The implementation of organizational measures to further improve state leadership and economic leadership has created good conditions for the victorious resolution of the historical tasks facing our country: further consolidating the Soviet multi-ethnic state, vigorously developing socialist industry, consolidating the collective farm system, developing culture, and improving the material welfare of workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, and all Soviet people. Improving state and economic leadership can enable our country to move more smoothly towards communism. (Originally published in the Soviet "Pravda" on April 26)

    关于苏维埃国家机关
    苏联  伊万诺夫
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下成功地建设着共产主义社会。在完成这个历史任务时，苏维埃国家是强有力的工具。党认为不断地和全面地巩固我们的社会主义国家是自己的神圣职责。
    苏维埃国家实现着经济组织工作和文化教育工作的职能，实现着保护公共财产不受偷窃和浪费、保卫国家不受外来的军事攻击的职能。为了成功地完成这一切职能，就需要有一个安排得很好的和灵活的国家机关。共产党以列宁和斯大林所制订的国家建设的科学原则为指南，过去和现在对于巩固苏维埃国家的威力、对于完善国家机关一直表现着特殊关怀。
    由于社会主义革命的结果，在毁坏资产阶级国家机器过程中所产生的苏维埃国家机关，与资产阶级的国家机关有着根本的区别。资产阶级的国家机关为少数剥削者服务，并与作为和它背道而驰的敌对力量的人民相对抗。苏维埃的国家机关是真正的人民的机关，它是由人民所建立并执行人民的意志的。我们国家机关的工作者是人民的公仆。
    斯大林同志曾指示说，苏维埃国家机关，按照这句话的深刻含义来说，是由苏维埃加上成百万的各种各样的党与非党的组织组成的。这些组织把苏维埃同最“下层”联接起来，把国家机关同千百万群众结合起来，并逐步地消灭国家机关与居民之间所存在的各种类似障碍的东西。
    社会主义社会中的国家管理的内容是与资产阶级的管理有着原则的区别的。在资本主义国家之中，管理首先就是压迫人民群众。资产阶级国家在资本主义的私有制和独占资本具有无限权利的条件之下，不能领导经济。在苏联，国家管理包括国家生活的政治、经济和文化生活的各个方面，它是动员人民群众从事共产主义建设的一种建设性的力量。
    苏维埃国家实现着对社会主义国民经济的领导，经常关怀着提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平，保卫社会主义的法制和国内的秩序。国家机关工作人员的使命，是保卫为苏联宪法所规定的苏联公民的不可侵犯的权利。他们面前的光荣而重大的任务，是实现共产党的政策和苏维埃政府的决议，为争取按时完成发展工业、运输、农业、贸易和文化的计划而斗争。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，国家机关随着社会主义国家的任务和职能的改变，也不断完善着。
    党在加强和改善国家机关方面的全部活动中的最重要组成部分，便是培养出掌握了管理艺术的具有专门知识和行政工作经验的工作干部。干部是领导国家的决定性力量。使机关工作更加完善就是指改善管理方法，要与官僚主义、保守主义和文牍主义的各种现象进行坚决斗争。
    党和政府所一贯实行的使国家机关日趋完善的措施，促进了经济建设和文化建设问题获得成功的解决。目前，摆在苏维埃国家面前，从而也是摆在国家机关面前的重大而复杂的任务，要求实行许多新的措施来进一步改善国家机关。
    随着这些要求的成熟，党和政府最近实行了一系列的组织措施以使苏维埃机关更趋完善，并加强国家领导和经济领导。苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议通过了苏联各部的改组法。部的数目已大大减少了，每一个部把性质相近的国民经济和文化部门的领导统一起来。
    早已存在的部和委员会制度——这些部和委员会管辖着国民经济和文化个别部门内较狭隘的一部分工作——在现在的条件下，已经不符合于共产主义建设的要求了。改组之前，许多经济部门和文化部门分由各部和机关管辖，因而造成了人为的障碍和工作中的平行现象，使相近的企业间交换经验的工作遇到困难，使干部分散，机关之间公文往来繁复。这一切都阻碍了许多最重要的经济建设和文化建设问题的有效解决。
    与合并各部的措施同时，扩大了部长们的职权，他们在苏联政府决议所规定的范围内有全权处理本部的物资和现金，解决他们所管辖的企业和机关的活动中的一切主要问题。扩大部长们的职权，其目的是提高他们对委托给他们的事业的责任心，同时保证及时解决与完成各部的任务有关的经济问题。
    各部的改组和部长职权的加大，其目的在于使国家机关更加接近群众，使国家机关精简，提高领导水平，使对国民经济和文化各部门的管理更加有效和熟练，保证成功地执行党和政府所制订的政策。
    对工业的领导有了重大的改变。我们苏维埃工业正在一日千里地发展着，种类越来越多，社会主义生产的合作化日益广泛。改组前，不同的部所管辖的性质相似的各企业中发生了许多共同的问题，而这些问题的统一解决却受到机关间的壁障的阻碍。
    各部的合并和部长们职权的加大，使领导更接近工厂，消除了对各工业部门管理中的平行现象和层次过多的现象。使对工业的领导的更臻完善，无疑将保证工业企业的工作能够更加改进，可以更顺利地完成提高劳动生产率，减低产品成本的任务，以及更充分地利用企业的内部潜力。
    在农业方面，以前的农业部、植棉部、国营农场部、农业储存部、林业部已合并成为苏联农业和农业储存部。农业和农业储存部部长的职权很广，其目的是使对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场的领导更加有效，更加灵活，提高农业机关在为社会主义农业进一步高涨的斗争中的作用。
    共产党和苏联政府非常注意文化的发展，在改组前，曾有许多部和委员会领导着文化建设的各部门。这使工作中发生了困难，减低了领导的水平，阻碍了干部的合理使用。有些部的工作中曾有着严重的缺点。譬如，第十九次党代表大会曾对以前的电影事业部进行了严厉的批评，党报曾揭露了无线电事业方面的重大的缺点。为了更成功地完成文化建设任务，设立了苏联文化部。
    改善国家机构和加大部长们的职权意味着一长制的进一步巩固，也意味着领导人作用的提高。今后，对国民经济部门和文化的某一部门的管理都集中在一个部里了。部长对迅速并正确地完成国家的任务和计划的责任提高了。现在，工作的成就在更大的程度上取决于很好地挑选必需的干部，正确地分配这些干部，很好地组织部内机关的工作和企业的工作。
    对国家机构采取适合时宜的重大改革之所以成为可能，是由于党培养了和教育了有高度业务能力的干部，他们在政治上是成熟的，他们善于执行党的政策，他们掌握了领导国家的艺术。各部的改组解脱出大批专家，这些人可以去加强基层机构，可以到企业中去。
    由于各部的改组、部长和各总管理机构的领导者的职权的扩大，教育机关全体工作人员对人民的责任感的工作就获得了更重大的意义。这种责任感就是对自己的工作，对确切而有效地完成政府任务的负责精神，和对整个国家利益的了解。
    党和政府对国家机构进行的改组和部长职权的大大扩大，要求加强对经济工作中的本位主义、浪费物资和钱款的情形作斗争，要求改良中央和地方的经济、核算和检查工作的组织，要求加强对国家和经济机构的活动的监督。
    对下面这些事情进行有系统的检查是有特别重大的意义的：检查各企业、各总管理机构和各部执行国民经济计划的情形，检查它们使用现有生产能力和发掘新的生产潜力的情形，遵守提高产品质量的规定，完成降低成本和节约制度的任务的情形等；必须加强用卢布来监督各经济组织完成减低成本，积累资金的情形，加强监督无条件地遵守国家纪律的情形。
    使国家机构更加完善的措施，使国家可以利用一切可能更灵活地进行计划，为发掘各地资源，完成经济计划的创造性表现开拓了更广阔的前途。
    使国家领导和经济领导更臻完善的组织措施的实行，替胜利地解决我国所面临的历史任务创造了很好的条件，这些任务是：进一步巩固苏维埃多民族的国家，全力发展社会主义工业，巩固集体农庄制度，发展文化，提高工人、集体农民、知识分子和全体苏维埃人的物质福利。改进国家和经济的领导能够使我们国家更顺利地走向共产主义。（原载四月二十六日苏联“真理报”）
