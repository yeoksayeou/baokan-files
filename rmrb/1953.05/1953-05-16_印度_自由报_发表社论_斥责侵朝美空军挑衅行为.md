Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 15th. The Indian Bengali-language newspaper "Freedom Daily" published a report on its front page on May 13th regarding the US Air Force's intrusion into Chinese airspace on May 10th and 11th, resulting in casualties among the Chinese people. It also published an editorial titled "Extreme Provocation," condemning this act of aggression by the US government.

The editorial stated: "When the United States 'finds that they no longer have any excuse to oppose the recent proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese side, and see that they must genuinely stop the war, they have taken this extreme provocative measure.'" The editorial said: "Everyone can see that this act of aggression does not show the aggressor's strength, but precisely demonstrates his extreme powerlessness." China and Korea have shown genuine enthusiasm and sincerity for the great goal of establishing peace. The United States "is now almost in a state of isolation and helplessness."

    印度“自由报”发表社论
    斥责侵朝美空军挑衅行为
    【新华社新德里十五日电】印度孟加拉文日报“自由报”十三日在首页刊载了美国侵朝空军在五月十日和十一日侵犯中国领空、杀伤中国人民的消息，并且以“极端的挑衅”为题发表社论，斥责美国政府这种侵略行为。
    社论写道：当美国“发现他们再没有什么借口可以反对朝中方面最近提出的建议，看到他们必须真正停止战争的时候，就采取了这种极端的挑衅手段。”社论说：“每个人都可以看出：这种侵略行为并不是显示侵略者的强大，而正是显示他的极端无力。”中国和朝鲜为了建立和平的伟大目标而表现了真正的热心和诚意。美国“今天已差不多陷入孤立无援的境地了。”
