Following the judicial reform movement across the country, a new atmosphere has emerged in judicial work.

After ideological remolding and organizational consolidation, judicial workers in various regions have basically eliminated old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles, and have established the people's judicial viewpoint and judicial style. During the judicial reform movement, judicial organs at all levels thoroughly exposed and criticized the old judicial viewpoints and judicial styles, providing a profound education for all judicial workers, basically demarcating the boundaries between the old and new laws, and improving their political and ideological level. At the same time, judicial organs at all levels carried out organizational consolidation work, purging and dealing with a number of bad elements and lawless and undisciplined elements who had infiltrated the people's judicial organs; more than 6,500 people were transferred to participate in judicial work, all of whom were outstanding cadres and activists among workers, peasants, youth, and women. Judicial cadres who have undergone ideological remolding generally show increased political responsibility and improved work efficiency. Most of the new recruits have clear standpoints and viewpoints, are good at contacting the masses, and after a period of training, most have begun to become familiar with their work, and some have even become model judicial workers. For example, Huang Miaoqin, a female labor model who newly joined the Shengxian County People's Court in Zhejiang Province, overcame the difficulties of her low level of education and unfamiliarity with the work with a high degree of initiative, and adopted the method of mediation to handle cases by relying on the masses. The circuit court team she led handled 48 cases in seven days, which was warmly supported by the masses.

People's courts in various regions have adopted the methods of investigation and research and contact with the masses, organized circuit courts, and implemented "bringing files to the countryside and trying cases on the spot" and "accepting cases in the countryside and trying them in a timely manner," changing the old style of simply "sitting in court and interrogating cases." In many areas, they have been able to correctly and quickly handle various cases. After the judicial reform, most of the presidents of the county people's courts in Shandong Province led cadres to the countryside to investigate the facts of the cases with the masses, explain policies to the masses, try cases on the spot, and promptly solve many pending cases; some county people's courts also adopted circuit trials, zonal contracting, and regular visits to the countryside, and many cases were resolved on the spot. After the judicial reform, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Court organized a working group to conduct circuit trials in ten counties (cities) including Chang'an and Wugong, handling more than 130 complex cases in one month, and also promptly understood and assisted the work of the county people's courts. The Tianjin Municipal People's Court generally adopted the combination of collective mediation and public trial, and the combination of comprehensive investigation and on-the-spot interrogation, and cleared 4,760 backlog cases and 540 long-term backlog complex cases in 45 days. The masses were very satisfied with the cases handled through the above methods, and praised: "In the past, lawsuits were filed at the yamen, but now lawsuits are filed at home"; "In the past, the yamen faced south, and those who had reason but no money could not enter; now the people's court comes to the countryside, and cunning and denial are useless."

Most people's courts across the country have set up people's reception rooms and gradually established grassroots mediation committee organizations to promptly resolve litigation issues among the masses, which makes the people feel extremely convenient. The People's Inquiry Office of the Datong City People's Court in Shanxi Province received more than 700 visits from the masses in eleven months. Among them, more than 350 cases were reminders and inquiries, and the Inquiry Office promptly contacted the civil and criminal courts and gave answers face-to-face. It also carefully inquired about the situation of the remaining more than 370 cases, and handled them through mediation if they could be handled; for cases with major circumstances, it wrote complaints for the visitors to formally sue and informed the personnel handling the case of the information learned. This greatly strengthened the connection between the people's court and the masses, and many cases were resolved through mediation by the Inquiry Office. After the Huangxian County People's Court in Shandong Province set up a reception room, anyone who came to the court to inquire about matters could be received in a timely manner, regardless of day or night. Everyone praised the court for truly serving the people. People's courts in many counties across the country have gradually established mediation committees in townships (streets). General civil disputes can be resolved locally through the mediation of the mediation committee, avoiding the people's back-and-forth travel and affecting production. There are more than 1,300 mediation committee members in Nanjing, all of whom are local people and familiar with the local situation. They can grasp the correct materials for general civil disputes and conduct reasonable mediation, so that the parties are convinced, and many disputes are mediated and resolved without going to court. For example, there was a debt case in the city that the court dragged on for more than a year, and the original handling personnel wrote a judgment of more than 4,000 words without being sure to announce it, but after the mediation committee conducted an in-depth investigation, it quickly helped the court resolve the case. Mediation committees in various regions have played a great role in judicial work. In Nanjing, among the 3,992 concluded cases, 3,020 were resolved through mediation, accounting for 75.6% of the total number of concluded cases.

After the judicial reform movement, the broad masses of the people generally realized that the people's court is truly guaranteeing the interests of the people, and they are very satisfied with the circuit trial, on-the-spot trial, and mediation system adopted by the people's court. The political enthusiasm of the people has also been greatly improved, and many people have voluntarily assisted the people's court in its work. During the construction phase of the judicial reform in East China, more than 300,000 people assisted the people's courts at all levels in clearing backlog cases. Some citizens in Chongqing are now assisting court staff in investigating and mediating cases, and are also automatically responsible for supervising the implementation of cases established by court mediation.

    全国各地司法改革运动收到良好的效果
    司法工作人员开始树立了人民司法观点和作风
    全国各地进行司法改革运动后，司法工作出现了新的气象。
    各地司法工作人员经过思想改造和组织整顿，基本上清除了旧法观点和旧司法作风，树立了人民的司法观点和司法作风。在司法改革运动中，各级司法机关彻底揭发和批判了旧的司法观点和司法作风，对于所有的司法工作者进行了一次深刻的教育，基本上划清了新旧法律的界限，提高了他们的政治思想水平。同时，各级司法机关都进行了组织整顿工作，清洗和处理了一批混入人民司法机关的坏分子和违法乱纪分子；调进了六千五百多人参加司法工作，他们都是优秀的干部和工人、农民、青年、妇女中的积极分子。经过思想改造的司法干部，普遍表现出政治责任心加强，工作效率提高。新参加工作的人员，大部分都有明确的立场、观点，善于联系群众，经过一个时期锻炼，多数已开始熟悉业务，其中有些人并已成为模范司法工作者。例如新参加浙江省嵊县人民法院工作的女劳动模范黄苗琴，以高度积极性克服了自己文化程度低和业务不熟悉的困难，依靠群众采取调解的办法办案，她领导的巡回审判小组，在七天内就处理了四十八宗案件，得到群众的热烈拥护。
    各地人民法院采用了调查研究、联系群众的审判方法，组织巡回法庭，实行“带卷下乡、就地审判”，“下乡收案、及时审判”，改变了过去单纯“坐堂问案”的旧作风，有不少地区已做到能正确地、迅速地处理各种案件。山东省大多数县人民法院院长在司法改革后曾先后带领干部下乡，和群众一起调查案情，向群众讲解政策，就地审判，及时解决了不少悬案；有些县人民法院还采用巡回审判、分区包干和定期下乡等办法，许多案件都就地得到解决。陕西省人民法院在司法改革后曾组织工作组到长安、武功等十个县（市）进行巡回审判，在一个月内处理了一百三十多件复杂的案件，同时也及时了解并帮助了县人民法院的工作。天津市人民法院普遍采用了集体调解与公开审判相结合，全面调查与就地审讯相结合的办法，四十五天就清理了四千七百六十件积案和五百四十件长期积压的复杂案件。经过上述办法处理的案件，群众都很满意，并称赞说：“往年打官司上衙门，而今打官司在家门”；“过去衙门向南开，有理无钱莫进来；现在人民法院下乡来，狡猾抵赖吃不开”。
    全国大部分人民法院都设置了人民接待室，逐步建立了基层调解委员会的组织，及时解决群众间的诉讼问题，使人民群众感到极大的方便。山西省大同市人民法院的人民问事处，十一个月内共接待来访群众七百多起。其中三百五十多件是催案和询问的，问事处都及时和民、刑两庭联系，当面作了答复。对其余三百七十多件也认真问明情况，能处理的就进行调解处理；对案情较大的就替来访者书写诉状正式起诉，并将所了解到的情况转告承办该案的人员。这大大加强了人民法院和群众的联系，许多案件经过问事处调解就解决了。山东黄县人民法院设置了接待室后，凡是到法院问事的人，不分昼夜，都能及时被接待。大家都称赞法院真正为人民办事。全国有不少县份的人民法院在乡（街）逐步设立了调解委员会，一般的民间纠纷，经过调解委员会的调解，大都能就地解决，避免了人民群众往返奔波，影响生产。南京市全市有一千三百多个调解委员，他们都是本地人，熟识本地情况，对一般民事纠纷都能掌握正确的材料，进行合理调解，使当事人口服心服，许多纠纷事件不用到法院就调解处理了。如该市有件债务案，法院拖了一年多，原承办人员写了四千多字的判决书还没有把握宣布，但经过调解委员深入调查，很快就帮助法院把这件案子解决了。各地的调解委员会对司法工作起了很大作用，南京市在三千九百九十二件结案中，其中经调解解决的就有三千零二十件，占结案总数百分之七十五点六。
    经过司法改革运动，广大群众普遍认识到人民法院是真正保障人民利益的，他们对于人民法院采取的巡回审判、就地审判和调解制度都感到很满意。人民群众的政治积极性也大大提高，有不少人自动协助人民法院进行工作。华东区在司法改革的建设阶段，协助各级人民法院清理积案的有关群众有三十多万人。重庆市有些市民现在一面协助法院工作人员调查和调解案件，一面又对法院调解成立的案件自动负责监督执行。（新华社）
