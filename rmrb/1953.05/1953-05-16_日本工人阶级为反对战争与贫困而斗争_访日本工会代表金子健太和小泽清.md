    Japanese Working Class Struggles Against War and Poverty
    ——An Interview with Japanese Trade Union Representatives Kaneko Kenta and Ozawa Kiyoshi
    By Tan Wenrui, Our Staff Reporter
    As Japan accelerates its transformation into a colony and military base of the United States, and as the Japanese economy, controlled by American monopoly capital, increasingly heads towards destruction, the lives of the Japanese working people are becoming more and more painful. On the other hand, the level of awareness of the Japanese people is also rapidly increasing, and their struggle for national independence and peace is constantly expanding. The Japanese working class stands at the forefront of this struggle. Since last year's "May Day," the Japanese labor movement has seen significant development. Kaneko Kenta, head of the Japanese trade union delegation, and Ozawa Kiyoshi, a member, who were invited to participate in our country's "May Day" celebration and the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions, told reporters about the further deterioration of the lives of Japanese workers and their intensified struggle against war and poverty.
    In order to pursue maximum profits and accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism, American and Japanese monopoly capitalists are carrying out increasingly cruel exploitation and oppression of the Japanese working class. They constantly force Japanese workers to extend working hours and intensify labor in order to squeeze their labor power; and the actual wages of workers are decreasing more and more due to rising prices and increased taxes, and are now only about 40 to 50 percent of what they were before the war. The Japanese reactionary government is also planning to further increase railway freight rates, electricity rates, and rice prices, which means that the actual wages of workers will be further reduced and their lives will become more difficult.
    Due to the shrinking of civilian industry, a large number of factories have closed or suspended operations. The factories that are still operating have implemented so-called "industrial rationalization," generally laying off workers. The number of unemployed workers in Japan continues to increase dramatically. In Japan, with a population of more than 80 million, there are more than 10 million unemployed or semi-unemployed workers. Japan also has so-called unemployment insurance, but in reality, less than 400,000 of the 10 million unemployed people are able to receive relief money. Some of these unemployed workers make a living by working as vendors in the cities, while others are displaced and have no means of support. American and Japanese monopoly capital has created a large number of unemployed people, on the one hand, attempting to use them as cannon fodder for aggression, and on the other hand, squeezing even cheaper labor from them. Many factories try to employ as few permanent workers as possible, and instead hire temporary workers from among the unemployed. For example, the Sagami factory in Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo has 1,600 workers, but only 100 are permanent workers, and the rest are temporary workers with contracts of only one or two months. The factory hires them when there is work to do, and fires them when there is no work to do. These temporary workers do not have the right to enjoy social insurance, and their wages are half of those of permanent workers. In some large enterprises, the wages of temporary workers are even less than 20 percent of those of permanent workers. Kaneko Kenta, talking about this situation, specifically pointed out: "American and Japanese monopoly capital's large-scale employment of temporary workers is not only to strengthen the exploitation of workers, but also to try to undermine the unity of workers, and the means are very vicious."
    If the lives of Japanese workers are like those of cattle and horses, then the lives of Japanese female workers are not even as good as cattle and horses. The situation of female workers is very tragic. The industry with the most female workers is the textile industry, and these female workers are all recruited from the countryside by various factories. Once they enter the factory, it is like entering a prison, and even their freedom of movement is deprived. The extremely heavy labor is only exchanged for a very small amount of wages. The wages of ordinary textile female workers are only 4,000 to 4,500 yen per month, while in Japan today, the minimum living expenses for one person per month is 8,000 to 9,000 yen. Female workers eat very bad food in the factories, and the living conditions are also very poor. There are no sanitary facilities in the workshops, and few can avoid contracting lung disease after working for three years. The textile female workers in small and medium-sized enterprises are even more miserable. Most of them are bought from the countryside by various factories through human traffickers. The factory first pays the parents of these female workers a sum of money, and then requires them to work without pay for two or three years. After the contract expires, each female worker can only receive 3,000 yen per month. Ozawa Kiyoshi said with infinite emotion: "When I saw the living conditions of Chinese female workers in Shanghai, I immediately thought of the tragic fate of Japanese female workers."
    The workers of Japan are not willing to endure this state of being enslaved and harmed, and their struggle for the right to live is becoming more and more frequent. The American and Japanese reactionaries, in order to suppress the struggle of the Japanese workers, are constantly strengthening fascist rule, using various means to restrict the activities of trade unions and workers, and using secret agents to monitor and intimidate workers. A large chemical factory of Mitsui monopoly capital built a new factory in Oita Prefecture, Kyushu, and employed 6,000 workers. Before letting them enter the factory, they were first handed over to former fascist soldiers for "training." In another factory in Omuta City, Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu, 2,000 workers were unreasonably laid off, and 2,000 "trained" workers were used to replace them. However, the various anti-labor measures of the American and Japanese reactionaries only arouse stronger resistance from the workers. Moreover, more and more workers have realized that the war policy of the United States is the root cause of their poverty and suffering. Therefore, while striving to improve their lives, the Japanese workers strongly oppose the re-militarization of Japan and the conspiracy of the United States to use Japan as a base for aggression. From October to December last year, 270,000 coal miners carried out a 61-day major strike, demanding increased wages and opposing "industrial rationalization," while opposing the United States mining coal in Japan to support the war of aggression against Korea. As a result of their strike, coal production was reduced by approximately 6 million tons, severely hitting the conspiracy of the United States to use Japan as a base for the war of aggression against Korea. The Japan Explosives Workers Union also made a resolution: not to manufacture explosives for war. This year, railway and transport workers launched a movement against transporting military supplies for the U.S. military. Workers in various enterprises are continuing to fight against supplying electricity to U.S. military supply factories at low prices. Japanese workers working in U.S. military bases, although under the threat of bayonets, continue to strike U.S. military plans with slowdowns and sabotage.
    In the struggle against turning Japan into a U.S. military base and colony, the unity of Japanese workers and peasants has been greatly strengthened. Workers generally oppose the reactionary government's measures to force the purchase of farmers' grain at low prices, and demand that grain be purchased at fair prices. The Showa Denko factory, which manufactures fertilizers, put forward the slogan of struggle in January this year: "Oppose American merchants selling cheap fertilizers to Japanese farmers at high prices!" Workers often support and participate in the struggles of farmers and fishermen against the construction of military bases by the United States in Japan. For example, the struggle of fishermen in Tokyo Bay against the construction of anti-submarine nets by the U.S. military has received strong support from various trade unions in Tokyo.
    The Japanese working class's actual struggle against war is playing a major role in promoting the Japanese people's movement to defend peace. As the voice of opposition to the Korean War among the broad masses of workers is rising, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also issued an appeal in January this year to stop the Korean War, and recently put forward relevant proposals. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on ending the Korean War last month was warmly supported by Japanese workers. Demanding an end to the Korean War has become one of the important slogans of the Japanese working class's struggle to defend peace.
    Kaneko Kenta said that the return of Japanese nationals from China has had a huge impact on the Japanese people: "The Japanese people are very grateful to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their strong assistance in the return of Japanese nationals. The issue of the return of Japanese nationals has not been resolved for a long time due to the delay and obstruction of the Yoshida government. Now, thanks to the assistance of the Chinese government and people and the efforts of Japanese democratic organizations, it has been successfully resolved. Therefore, the prestige of the Japanese ruling group among the people has further declined, while the prestige of Japanese democratic organizations has greatly increased." Ozawa Kiyoshi pointed out: The Japanese people are very concerned about the situation in New China, and the masses are scrambling to inquire about the situation in China from returning overseas Chinese. Although the report meetings held by returned overseas Chinese in various places have been obstructed in every possible way by the Yoshida government, the audience is still very crowded. Japanese bourgeois newspapers and Japanese democratic organizations have jointly formed an editorial organization to prepare to publish a "China Experience Record," reporting the actual situation of New China through the returned overseas Chinese. The first edition is planned to be published in 200,000 copies. This also shows the enthusiasm of the Japanese people to understand New China. These Japanese overseas Chinese who have lived in China for many years have a new understanding of China, and their experiences in China will have a great impact among the Japanese people. The Japanese people will certainly demand more urgently to establish friendly relations with China and resume Sino-Japanese trade.
    Kaneko Kenta said: The Japanese people's call for the development of Sino-Japanese trade is rising, and some bourgeois also see the benefits of doing business with China, especially the capitalists of some civilian enterprises, who know that without the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade, they will not only have no prospects for development, but will also tend to go bankrupt. Although the American and Japanese reactionaries are trying to obstruct it, they cannot prevent the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade for long.
    Finally, the two of them talked about their feelings about participating in our country's "May Day" celebration and the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions this year: "After participating in this year's 'May Day' celebration in Beijing and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, I deeply felt the Chinese people's infinite trust in the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong's leadership; they are fighting with all their strength for the industrialization and economic construction of the motherland. The Chinese people's determination and confidence in striving to build their motherland will give the Japanese people unlimited encouragement, and make them more bravely carry out the struggle for national independence and peace!"

    日本工人阶级为反对战争与贫困而斗争
    ——访日本工会代表金子健太和小泽清
    本报记者　谭文瑞
    随着日本加速变成美国的殖民地和军事基地，在美国垄断资本控制下的日本经济日益走向毁灭的道路，日本劳动人民的生活愈来愈痛苦；另一方面，日本人民的觉悟程度也迅速提高，他们为争取民族独立与和平的斗争不断在扩大，日本的工人阶级站在这斗争的最前列。自从去年“五一”以来日本工人运动又有了很大的发展。应邀参加我国“五一”庆祝大会和工会第七次全国代表大会的日本工会代表团团长金子健太和团员小泽清，向记者叙述了日本工人生活进一步恶化以及他们加强为反对战争与贫困而斗争的近况。
    美日垄断资本家为了追求最大限度的利润和加紧复活日本军国主义，对日本工人阶级进行愈来愈残酷的剥削和压迫。他们不断强迫日本工人延长工作时间，加强劳动强度，以榨取工人的劳动力；而工人的实际工资，由于物价上涨、税收加重，愈来愈下降，现在已降到只等于战前百分之四十至五十左右。日本反动政府最近又在计划再提高铁路运费、电费和米价，这意味着工人的实际工资将进一步减少，生活要更加困苦。
    由于民用工业萎缩，大量工厂倒闭或停工，开工的工厂又实行所谓“产业合理化”，普遍裁减工人，日本失业工人的数目继续激增，在人口八千多万的日本，竟有一千万以上的失业或半失业工人。日本也有所谓失业保险，但是实际上一千万失业者中能够得到救济金的不到四十万人。这些失业工人有一部分在城市中靠当小贩糊口，另外一部分则流离颠沛，生活无着。美日垄断资本制造了大批的失业者，一方面企图利用他们充当侵略炮灰，另一方面在他们之中榨取更廉价的劳动力。许多工厂都尽量少用固定的工人，而从失业者中雇用临时工人。像东京附近神奈川县的相模工厂有一千六百名工人，只有一百人是固定的工人，其余都是临时雇用的、只有一个月或两个月合同的工人。厂方有工可做时把他们雇来，无工可做时便把他们解雇。这些临时工人没有享受社会保险的权利，而且他们的工资比固定工人的工资少一半，在一些大企业中，临时工人的工资还不到固定工人的百分之二十。金子健太谈到这种情形，特别指出：“美日垄断资本大量雇用临时工人不仅是为了要加强对工人的剥削，而且还企图借此破坏工人的团结，手段是非常毒辣的。”
    如果说日本工人的生活像牛马一般，则日本女工的生活便连牛马都不如。女工的情况是十分悲惨的。女工最多的是纺织业，这些女工都是各工厂从农村召募来的。她们进了工厂就如同进了监狱一样，连行动的自由都被剥夺，极繁重的劳动只换得很微小的一点工钱，普通纺织女工的工资每月只有四千到四千五百日元，而在今天的日本，一个人一个月最低的生活费就需八千到九千日元。女工们在工厂里吃着极坏的饭食，居住的条件也很恶劣，在车间工作又没有卫生设备，干上三年很少有不染肺病的。中小企业的纺织女工更苦，她们大多数是各工厂通过人贩到农村去买来的。工厂先付给这些女工的父母一笔款子，便要她们无报酬地做两三年的工；合同期满以后，每个女工每月也只能拿到三千日元的工资。小泽清无限感慨地说：“我在上海看到中国女工的生活情况，就立刻想到日本女工的悲惨命运。”
    日本的工人是不甘于忍受这种被奴役与被损害的苦况的，他们为争取生活权利的斗争是愈来愈频繁了。美日反动派为了镇压日本工人的斗争，不断加强法西斯的统治，用各种手段限制工会和工人的活动，利用特务对工人进行监视和恐吓。三井独占资本的大化学工厂在九州大分县新建的一个工厂，雇用六千工人，事先把他们交由以前的法西斯军人 “训练”，才让他们进厂。在九州福冈县大牟田市的另外一个工厂，无理裁减了两千工人，而用两千名经过“训练”的工人来代替。但是美日反动派的各种反劳工的措施，只有激起工人更强烈的反抗。而且愈来愈多的工人已认识到，美国的战争政策是他们贫困和痛苦的根源，因此日本工人在争取改善生活的同时，强烈地反对日本的重新军国主义化和美国利用日本作为侵略基地的阴谋。去年十月到十二月，二十七万煤矿工人进行了六十一天的大罢工，一方面要求增加工资，反对“产业合理化”，同时反对美国在日本挖煤支持侵朝战争。他们罢工的结果，使煤的产量减少约六百万吨，沉重地打击了美国利用日本为侵朝基地的阴谋。日本火药工人联合会也曾作出决议：不制造供应战争的火药。今年铁路与运输工人展开了反对为美国军队运输军需品的运动。各企业的工人并继续进行反对廉价供应美国军需工厂电力的斗争。在美国军事基地工作的日本工人，虽然在刺刀的威胁下，仍然不断以怠工和破坏来打击美国的军事计划。
    在反对把日本变成美国的军事基地和殖民地的斗争中，日本工人和农民的团结大大地加强了。工人普遍反对反动政府强迫低价征购农民粮食的措施，要求以公平价格收购粮食。制造肥料的昭和电工工厂今年一月提出斗争的口号：“反对美国商人把廉价肥料以高价卖给日本农民！”工人们经常支援并参加农民和渔民反对美国在日本修筑军事基地的斗争。像东京湾的渔民反对美军修筑防潜艇网的斗争，便获得东京各工会的大力支持。
    日本工人阶级反对战争的实际斗争对日本人民保卫和平运动起着很大的推动作用。由于广大的工人群众反对朝鲜战争的声浪日益高涨，日本工会总评议会今年一月也发出要求停止朝鲜战争的呼吁，最近并提出有关的建议。周恩来总理上月发表关于结束朝鲜战争的声明，受到日本工人的热烈拥护。要求结束朝鲜战争已成为目前日本工人阶级保卫和平斗争的重要口号之一。
    金子健太谈到在中国的日侨回国对于日本人民所发生的巨大影响说：“日本人民对于中国政府和中国人民大力协助日侨回国十分感激。日侨回国问题长期因为吉田政府的拖延阻挠而未得解决，现在由于中国政府与人民的协助以及日本民主团体的努力已顺利解决了；因此使得日本统治集团在人民中的声望更加低落，而日本民主团体的威信则大大提高。”小泽清指出：日本人民对于新中国的情况是十分关怀的，群众们都争着向归国的侨胞打听中国的情形。归侨在各处举行的报告会虽受到吉田政府的百般阻挠，听众还是十分拥挤。日本的资产阶级报纸并与日本的民主团体联合组成一个编辑机构，准备出版一本“中国体验记”，通过归国的侨民报道新中国的实况，第一版便准备发行二十万册。从这一件事情也可以看出日本人民渴望了解新中国的热情。这些在中国居留多年的日本侨民对中国都有新的认识，他们在中国的体验，将在日本人民中间发生很大的影响。日本人民一定将更迫切地要求与中国建立友好邦交和恢复中日贸易。
    金子健太说：日本人民要求发展中日贸易的呼声日益高涨，一部分资产阶级也看到和中国做生意的利益，特别是一些民用企业的资本家，知道不恢复中日贸易，他们不仅没有发展前途，而且要趋于破产。美日反动派虽然力图阻挠，但也不能长久阻止中日贸易的恢复。
    最后他们两位谈到参加我国今年“五一”节庆祝大会和工会第七次全国代表大会的感想说：“参加了今年北京的‘五一’庆祝大会和中国工会第七次全国代表大会，深深感觉到中国人民对于中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导的无限信赖；他们正以全部力量为祖国的工业化经济建设而奋斗。中国人民努力建设祖国的决心和信心，将给予日本人民无限的鼓舞，使他们更勇猛地进行争取民族独立与和平的斗争！”
