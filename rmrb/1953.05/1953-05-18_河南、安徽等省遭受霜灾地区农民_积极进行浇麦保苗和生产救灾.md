Farmers in areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces that have suffered from frost damage have taken various effective measures under the leadership of local Party and government leading organs and are actively watering wheat to protect seedlings and carry out disaster relief production.

Over the past month, more than 250 counties in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces were suddenly hit by a late frost unprecedented in decades, and more than 96 million mu of crops suffered varying degrees of frost damage. Winter wheat was the most severely affected, accounting for more than 75 percent of the total area of affected crops.

After the frost disaster occurred, the central and local Party and government leading organs immediately took various effective disaster relief measures, leading farmers in the disaster areas to vigorously carry out wheat watering to protect seedlings and replanting campaigns. Zhao Wenfu, Second Deputy Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in the heavily affected areas, Guan Wenwei, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, and Huang Yan, Vice Chairman of the Anhui Provincial People's Government, and other responsible personnel went deep into the disaster areas to help local cadres strengthen the leadership of disaster relief production work. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, as well as the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, also sent a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to express their condolences, inspect the disaster situation, and assist local governments in guiding disaster relief production work. Through publicity, condolences, and inspection of the disaster situation, all localities explained the favorable conditions for overcoming the disaster, established the idea that "man will conquer nature," and initially stabilized the emotions of farmers in the disaster areas, quickly launched a campaign to protect seedlings and replant, and universally carried out watering, fertilization, wheat weeding, and replanting. Many affected wheat seedlings turned from yellow to green, and the wheat plants whose main stems were frozen to death quickly grew branches. Autumn grain and early-maturing crops were replanted in wheat fields where there was indeed no hope. For example, in Fuyang, Boxian, Linquan, Guoyang, and Funan counties in Anhui Province, 110,000 mu of sorghum, corn, and melons were replanted in three days after the rain in late April.

Party and government leading organs at all levels and state-owned economic departments have worked hard to allocate and supply food and seeds, and vigorously support farmers in disaster areas. In addition to the timely distribution of this year's relief grain funds, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government also allocated an additional 70 billion yuan to help households in difficulty solve their food problems. Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces mobilized the masses to help each other, and issued local reserve seeds on loan to help farmers solve the problem of lack of replanting seeds. The Central People's Government and the East China Administrative Committee also allocated 160 million jin of sorghum, corn, and other seeds to help solve the problem of seed shortage in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. The People's Bank of China also issued seed loans of more than 60 billion yuan in Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces. In order to ensure the supply of grain in the disaster areas, the central and provincial food departments have strengthened a series of tasks such as grain scheduling, market management, and organization of supply. In late April, the grain scheduled to be additionally transferred to Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces has been steadily transported.

In addition, state-owned economic departments in the disaster areas are vigorously helping farmers sell local products and develop sideline production. The Jiangsu Provincial Native Produce Company purchased a large amount of vermicelli and other sideline products from farmers in Huaiyin, Shuyang, Suqian, and other places. The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Cooperatives has helped farmers in the Xuzhou area open up sales channels for reed mats, and is preparing to purchase safflower grass seeds in large quantities in Suzhou, Songjiang, and other areas to supply farmers in disaster areas with green manure planting.

At present, farmers in various disaster-stricken areas are carrying out spring plowing and sowing in full swing after the end of seedling protection and replanting. However, cadres and the masses in many areas still do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of actively increasing grain production from a long-term perspective; some still have the idea of ​​simply relying on government relief; saving for famine and sideline production have not been universally carried out; and the sales channels for local specialties have not been well opened. These problems must be resolved in a timely manner in order to completely overcome the disaster.

    河南、安徽等省遭受霜灾地区农民
    积极进行浇麦保苗和生产救灾
    近一月来，河南、安徽、江苏、山东、山西等省遭受霜灾地区的农民，在当地党政领导机关的领导下，采取了各项有效的措施，正积极进行浇麦保苗和生产救灾。
    四月初，河南、安徽、江苏、山东、山西等省的二百五十多个县，突然遭到几十年来所未有的晚霜袭击，共有九千六百余万亩的农作物，遭受到不同程度的冻害。其中以冬小麦受害最重，占各种受害作物总面积的百分之七十五以上。
    霜灾发生以后，中央及当地各级党政领导机关，立即采取了各项有效的生产救灾措施，领导受灾地区的农民大力开展了浇麦保苗和补种运动。重灾区的中共河南省委员会第二副书记赵文甫，江苏省人民政府副主席管文蔚，安徽省人民政府副主席黄岩等负责人员，都深入灾区，帮助当地干部，加强生产救灾工作的领导。中央人民政府内务部、农业部、粮食部、财政部以及中国人民银行总行、合作总社等部门，也派出大批干部，分头到灾区进行慰问，检查灾情，协助地方政府指导生产救灾工作。各地通过宣传慰问和检查灾情，说明克服灾荒的有利条件，树立“人定胜天”的思想，初步地稳定了灾区农民的情绪，迅速开展了保苗补种运动，普遍进行浇水、施肥、锄麦、补种。许多受害的麦苗由黄变绿，主干冻死的麦株，很快地长出了分枝。确实无望的麦田则补种秋禾和早熟作物，如安徽省阜阳、亳县、临泉、涡阳、阜南五县，在四月下旬雨后三天中就补种了高粱、玉米、瓜类达十一万亩。
    各级党、政领导机关和国营经济部门努力调拨、供应口粮和种籽，大力支援灾区农民。中央人民政府内务部、财政部除及时发放了今年度救济粮款外，又增拨了七百亿元，帮助困难户解决了口粮问题。河南、山东、山西三省发动群众互助互借，并贷发本地储备的备荒种籽，帮助农民解决了缺乏补种种籽的问题。中央人民政府及华东行政委员会又调拨高粱、玉米等种籽一亿六千万斤，帮助解决安徽、江苏两省的缺种问题。人民银行也在河南、江苏、山东三省，贷发种籽贷款六百多亿元。为保证灾区粮食的供应，中央及各省粮食部门都加强了粮食调度、市场管理和组织供应等一系列工作。四月下旬，规定增调到河南、安徽、江苏三省的粮食，均已源源运到。
    此外，受灾地区的国营经济部门，正大力帮助农民推销土产，开展副业生产。江苏省土产公司在淮阴、沭阳、宿迁等地，大量收购农民的粉丝和其他副业产品。江苏省合作总社已帮助徐州专区的农民打开了芦席的销路，并正准备在苏州、松江等专区，大批收购红花草籽，供给灾区农民播种绿肥。
    目前，各受灾地区的农民，在保苗补种结束后，正紧张进行春耕播种。但不少地区的干部、群众对于从长期着眼积极增产粮食的重要性还认识不足；有的还存在单纯依赖政府救济思想；节约备荒和副业生产还没有普遍开展；土产特产的销路还没很好打开。这些问题必须及时予以解决，才能做到彻底战胜灾荒。
