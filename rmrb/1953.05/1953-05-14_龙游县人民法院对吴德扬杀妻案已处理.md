    Longyou County People's Court Handles Wu Deyang's Wife-Killing Case
    Xie Yuquan wrote: My suggestion regarding "Longyou County People's Court in Zhejiang Province should expedite the handling of Wu Deyang's wife-killing incident," which was published in your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column on July 30th last year, prompted the Longyou County People's Court to cease its previous procrastination. The court adopted serious and effective measures to address this incident: it successively published notices in the Zhejiang Daily and Quzhou Dazhong Bao newspapers, wanted the wife-killer Wu Deyang; simultaneously, the court also collaborated with the County Public Security Bureau to organize an inspection team to conduct checks in relevant areas. Ensnared in the people's dragnet, Wu surrendered himself to the authorities on August 29th of last year. After a thorough investigation and interrogation, the court confirmed that Wu had consistently engaged in arson, poisoning, and robbery before liberation, having burned down civilian houses and poisoned one of his nephews to death. After liberation, Wu continued to steal; his wife, Zhou Xue, repeatedly advised him to change his ways, but not only did he show no remorse, but he held a grudge and stabbed Zhou Xue with a knife, causing serious injuries. After the incident, Wu fled, and then secretly returned to the village to threaten Zhou Xue: "Last time I didn't kill you, this time I will definitely kill you; and I will set fire to burn down the house." This caused panic among the villagers day and night. Based on the opinions of the masses, the court sentenced Wu to death. The masses unanimously supported this sentence, saying, "This is truly gratifying."

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    龙游县人民法院对吴德扬杀妻案已处理
    谢玉泉来信：我提出的“浙江龙游县人民法院应赶快处理吴德扬杀妻事件”的建议，于去年七月三十日在你报“读者来信”栏刊出后，龙游县人民法院不再像以前那样拖拉了。该院对这一事件采取了严肃而有效的措施：先后在浙江日报和衢州大众报上登过通缉杀妻犯吴德扬的启事；同时，该院又协同县公安局组织了检查组到有关方面检查。在人民的天罗地网中，吴犯终于去年八月二十九日自行投案。该院经过了详细的调查和审讯，证实吴犯在解放前一贯放火、放毒、抢劫，曾经烧毁民房，毒死侄儿一人。解放后，吴犯继续偷盗；其妻周雪屡加规劝，不惟毫未悔改，反而怀恨在心，竟用刀刺杀周雪致重伤。吴犯于事出后逃走，继又偷偷回村威胁周雪：“前次没杀死你，这次一定要杀死你；并且要放火把房子烧掉。”弄得村中日夜都人心惶惶。该院根据群众意见，判处吴犯死刑。群众一致拥护这一判处，并说：“真是大快人心。”
