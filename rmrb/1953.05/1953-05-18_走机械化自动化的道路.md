Taking the Road of Mechanization and Automation
By our reporter Lu Hao

(Continued from yesterday)

This is the fundamental direction of progress. When the "Rapid Steel Rolling Method" of the roughing mill appeared, the finishing mill seemed unable to cope. Zhang Mingshan's "Counter-Encirclement Plate" suggestion was brought to the attention of Director Yan Ming.

Zhang Mingshan didn't lose heart because of Wei Mingrang's obstruction. He continued to experiment, trying to understand why the steel bar couldn't stand on its side when entering the guide plate. It was like a knot that couldn't be untied. He looked at his "steel bar" made of dried meat skin and realized it was too thin. So he put two small, flat, round "geba" on the pigskin "fake steel bar," with a small iron piece in between. He ran the "steel bar" back and forth in the rolling groove of the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" [Note 8]. He experimented night after night, not knowing how many dark nights he spent. The "steel bar" still entered lying down and exited lying down, never standing up. He became thin and sallow, squatting on the ground, his head so heavy he couldn't lift it. He staggered when he walked and eventually fell ill. Even when he was sick, he was thinking about the site and the "Counter-Encirclement Plate."

He wasn't fully recovered, but when he could barely get up, he forced himself to go to work. One morning, he was changing the rolling groove with the workers when he happened to look back. He saw two clamping plates on the roller table of the roughing and finishing mills. When the coming steel bar hit the clamping plates, it "whooshed" into the guide plate of the finishing mill. The sight was like a flash of inspiration, like a window suddenly opening in his mind. He sluggishly walked over and loosened the screws on the clamping plates. He watched as a steel bar came over, hit the clamping plates, and since the plates were loose, the steel bar didn't go in. He quickly tightened the screws again, and another steel bar came over, hit the clamping plates, and went in smoothly. This made him incredibly happy. After work, he flew home, cut half a white iron bucket to make a clamping plate, and tested it on his "Counter-Encirclement Plate" that night. Sure enough, the "steel bar" could stand up and enter the guide plate smoothly.

He was so happy that he couldn't contain himself. He told the comrades in the spare parts team, and the news spread. This was exactly when Yan Ming was troubled by the problems with the finishing mill, and when the dangerous conditions of the factory's labor protection work could not be improved.

Yan Ming and Kang Zhaowen, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the small mill, had the same reaction to Zhang Mingshan's creation of the "Counter-Encirclement Plate." They felt that Zhang Mingshan's creation was well-founded. It not only improved production by improving equipment but also permanently ensured the safety of the rolling workers. The Party Committee of the small mill decided without hesitation to include Zhang Mingshan's "Counter-Encirclement Plate" test in the technical organization measures plan for September [Note 9] and assigned the organization committee member of the Party branch to specifically help Zhang Mingshan.

September 14, 1952, was the day scheduled to test Zhang Mingshan's "Counter-Encirclement Plate." Zhang Mingshan was both happy and afraid that day. He was happy that his "Counter-Encirclement Plate," which he had worked hard on for several years, had the opportunity to be tested. He was afraid that the factory would stop production to test his "Counter-Encirclement Plate," and if it didn't work, how could he bear it? When the "Counter-Encirclement Plate," made according to his design and with the joint efforts of the comrades, began to be installed, his whole body was extremely tense.

All the preparations for the test were completed. The director only said, "Let's try one." The steel bar, red-hot and blazing, whooshed over from the roughing mill. Zhang Mingshan's heart was racing at this time, and beads of sweat were dripping down his face. He heard a "clang" as the steel bar stopped and did not enter the guide plate of the rolling mill. Zhang Mingshan's face turned pale. At this time, Kang Zhaowen, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the small mill, was standing next to him. He only heard him say, "It's got potential, but the angle of the mouth is wrong." Old Kang was a rolling worker himself. When Zhang Mingshan heard him say it had potential, his heart calmed down. The director continued to direct everyone to adjust the mouth and guide plate, and then shouted, "Try another one!" Hundreds of eyes watched as the steel bar climbed along the roller table, reached the "Counter-Encirclement Plate," and in the blink of an eye, entered the rolling mill, winding and turning, whooshing back and forth in front of and behind the rolling mill. The whole workshop resounded with thunderous applause.

The workers warmly surrounded Zhang Mingshan. Director Yan Ming ran over and hugged him, saying, "Zhang Mingshan, you have solved a big problem for our small mill." The workers' joy was even more indescribable. Lu Changkuan squeezed up to Zhang Mingshan and patted him on the shoulder, saying, "With your 'Counter-Encirclement Plate,' I can live ten years longer."

The initial situation was very good. Steel bars whooshed through one after another. With the "Counter-Encirclement Plate," the production capacity of 22-millimeter diameter steel bars quickly increased by 15.4%. But later, when rolling thicker 25-millimeter diameter steel bars, the production situation fluctuated. Sometimes, the steel bar would hit the mouth as far as a zhang (3.3 meters) away. One night, there were more than two hundred qualified finished products and one hundred and eighty rejected ones. There was no way to continue, so they had to remove the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" and resume manual work.

This day was both happy and heavy. They were happy that the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" was definitely useful and could be said to be basically successful. They were weighed down by the new problem that they couldn't solve no matter how hard they stared.

Yan Ming and Kang Zhaowen didn't eat much from morning until midnight. They returned to the director's office and continued to worry about the "Counter-Encirclement Plate." Yan Ming didn't fall asleep until after three o'clock that night. Everyone else was asleep, but he was still thinking: we must not let the machines control us; we must control the machines. He thought about the mouth that wasn't working well and reasoned with himself: please ask the forging factory to make a flat iron mouth; that might work.

The next day, the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" was reinstalled and tested. Because the problem with the mouth was still not resolved, the production situation was good one moment and bad the next, like having malaria. According to the daily production task, they had already fallen behind by several hundred tons of steel. People were staring blankly, like they were facing a seriously ill patient, without any way to treat it. Later, quality problems arose again. The round steel bars coming out of the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" all had a groove one millimeter deep and two millimeters wide. Every single one, hundreds of tons of steel, was like this. The workers kept taking the mouth off to repair it, but they couldn't solve the problem, which was very frustrating. Some technicians, seeing this, wavered again. They advised the director to remove the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" and use the old method to produce, as they were wasting time in vain and wouldn't be able to complete the production task. Yan Ming and Kang Zhaowen were very firm. They said, "If we take it off, we won't be able to know where the problem is, and there will be no way to study it." As they said this, they had not left the factory for six days and six nights.

Just when something was about to succeed, there was a danger of complete failure. Fortunately, Soviet experts came. Seeing this situation, the experts immediately helped us change the shape of the mouth. In this way, the experiment of the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" was finally a complete success. The output immediately returned to normal, and the quality problems were also solved.

The final success of the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" enabled the finishing mill's production capacity to quickly increase by 40%. This "Counter-Encirclement Plate" cost only three million yuan, but it creates 52.7 billion yuan of wealth for the country every year. In particular, the eighteen workers who originally worked on the finishing mill can now do other work. They no longer have to risk their lives and no longer have to work under the heat, water, and cold wind.

Only after more than seven months

The successful testing of Zhang Mingshan's "Counter-Encirclement Plate" was like lighting a fire in the small mill. This fire ignited everyone's creative enthusiasm. This fire made people vividly see the brilliant future of moving towards mechanization and automation.

From then on, the people in the small mill no longer said that there was no way to deal with those bad, semi-manual and semi-mechanical equipment. They were full of confidence in transforming those repulsive old equipment in front of the heating furnace, in front of the rolling mill, in front of the shears and cooling beds.

Lu Naitao was a heating worker [Note 10]. When they worked, their bodies had to be close to high heat of more than 1,000 degrees. From the heating furnace, four people had to use steel hooks and ropes to pull out three burning steel billets, each weighing 280 kilograms, every minute. Lu Naitao had been working in front of the heating furnace for seventeen years. The scars all over his neck, body, hands, and feet were the painful memories that his work had left him.

Two years ago, he also tried to use a machine to replace the manual operation in front of the heating furnace. He experimented with a machine designed by the Japanese in the past, but the result was a failure.

The successful testing of the "Counter-Encirclement Plate" guided the eyes of everyone in the factory towards the wonderful vision of mechanization and automation.

Once, technician Wu Liangya saw this old machine and ran to ask Lu Naitao, "Why can't this machine be used?"

"The steel pushing is too slow."

Wu Liangya thought: wouldn't it be enough to speed up the motor? He accompanied Lu Naitao to the main electrical room and found a motor with 1,452 revolutions per minute. He helped Lu Naitao draw diagrams and design, and the problem of speed was solved. But then they discovered that there was a problem with the furnace bottom. The furnace bottom was high, and the "big ram" [Note 11] of the steel pushing machine couldn't go up, and sometimes the "big ram" couldn't retract, so it was burned out. The two repeatedly experimented but couldn't fix it.

Some technicians put forward new suggestions. They advocated using an air compressor to drive it. And they said, "This semi-automatic method is much easier than manual operation in the past."

Lu Naitao and Wu Liangya unanimously opposed, saying, isn't this going backwards? How can people run after the machine?

The problems that occurred on the steel pushing machine were quickly known to electrical workers Sun Shiping, Li Chunquan, and Yang Pengfei. They solved the problems that Lu Naitao and Wu Liangya could not solve. That man named Sun Shiping, when he was making a part called "limit switch" [Note 12] for the steel pushing machine, he thought of how he often saw someone waving his hand to direct the pipe blanks [Note 13] coming from the finishing mill when he passed the operating table some time ago. He waved his hand, and the front would send it over, but it was often wrong. Sometimes, seeing the one in front pass, he would call the one behind to come up. When the machine malfunctioned, the pipe blanks in front and behind would squeeze together. He thought that this place didn't need people at all. Without people, he could still guarantee that the past problems wouldn't occur. He used a piece of iron plate the size of a palm and created an automatic billet diverting machine on the cooling bed. When the cooled pipe blanks arrived here, they no longer needed someone to direct them. They could automatically go up and automatically walk away. If the one in front didn't walk away, the one behind wouldn't come up.

In just over seven months, the mass mechanization and automation movement had changed the original appearance of the small mill. It increased the labor productivity of the small mill by 41.5%, which allowed the country to increase its income by 260.4 billion yuan every year, and fundamentally improved labor protection work.

Now, when you go to the small mill, there is only one worker sitting in front of the heating furnace. He only needs to press a button, and the automatic steel pushing machine will push out a red-hot steel billet from the heating furnace, and then the feeding machine behind will automatically send up a cold steel billet. The automatic steel turning machine in front of the roughing mill was a collaboration between engineer Zhou Renyuan and Kang Zhaowen. When the steel billet reaches the steel turning machine, it automatically rolls and turns on both sides of the machine, and then automatically drills back and forth in the rolling mill. Zhang Mingshan's "Counter-Encirclement Plate" is on the finishing mill. The slender red-hot steel bars automatically circle tamely in front of and behind the rolling mill. The main rolling processes have gradually been mechanized and automated. People have forever bid farewell to the past intolerable working conditions and opened up a new path.

In front of the rolling mill for rolling pipe blanks, workers originally had to operate at a high temperature of more than 1,000 degrees. Their faces, chests, and bellies were baked and changed color, and their skin was stretched so tightly that it was like a dry wooden board. Now, worker Zhang Zhushan has created a "standing encirclement plate," which can make the red-hot pipe blanks come up by themselves, bend over by themselves, and enter the rolling mill by themselves. The workers there only need to occasionally adjust the machine to work.

The coiling machine no longer needs to be managed by people. When the steel bar comes, it will automatically rotate. When it is finished coiling, it will automatically stop and automatically unload.

How many seconds it takes to roll a steel bar, how many steel bars are rolled every hour, and how much time the machine stops are also automatically recorded by an automatic recorder instead of manual calculation.

Various machines are still being designed, cast, and installed. At the entrance of the workshop, the concrete foundation has been laid. A material handling machine will soon be installed here. When the steel billet arrives at the entrance of the small mill, it can be automatically transported to the heating furnace.

The small mill is being transformed from a factory with very backward and poor equipment into a mechanized and automated factory. It is like a lamp, illuminating an ideal path for the country's original factories – the path of advancing towards mechanization and automation.

    走机械化自动化的道路

    （续昨）
    这才是前进的根本方向当毛轧机的“快速轧钢法”一出现，光轧机正显得无法应付的时候，张明山的“反围盘”建议被燕鸣厂长知道了。
    张明山并没有因为魏铭让的阻拦就泄了气，他一直在继续试验钢条为什么在进入导板的时候总是不能侧立起来。这像一个死疙瘩，怎么也是解不开，他看看自己用干肉皮做的“钢条”还是太瘦，于是他又在猪皮做的假钢条上，每穿上两个小扁圆形的“格巴”，中间就加一块小铁片儿。他使这“钢条”在“反围盘”的轧槽〔注八〕里走来走去，他一夜一夜的试验，又不知道连干了多少黑夜，这“钢条”还是躺着进来，躺着出去，怎么也立不起来。他黄皮拉瘦，蹲在地上，脑袋重得抬也抬不起来，走起路来，晃晃荡荡，结果终于病倒了。他病倒了，心里也想着现场，想着那“反围盘”。
    他病还没有全好，刚勉强能起来，就强打着精神上班。有一天上午，他和工人们一块换轧槽，干着干着，他偶然回头一看，看那毛轧机和光轧机的滚道上，有两块夹板，来的钢条，在夹板上一撞，那钢条“飕”的一下就进了光轧机的导板，他无意中一见这，心上“豁”的一亮，像立刻开了一扇窗户。他黏黏糊糊地走过去，把夹板上的螺丝松了一下，他看着有一根钢过来了，在夹板上一撞，夹板松了，钢条就没有进去，他很快又把螺丝拧紧，又一根钢过来了，一撞夹板，钢就顺利地进去了，这简直使他乐得不行。下了班，他飞也似地回到家里，剪了半个白铁桶做夹板，晚上，他安在他的“反围盘”上一试验，果然那“钢条”能立起来顺利地进入导板了。
    他这一高兴，就再也蹩不住了，他给备品班的同志们一说，事情就传开了。这正是燕鸣为光轧机发生的烦恼所困扰的时候，正是全厂的劳动保护工作凶险状况无法改善的时候。
    燕鸣和小型厂的党委会副书记康兆文对于张明山创造“反围盘”的反应是一致的。他们觉得张明山的创造是有根据的，它不但是用改善设备的方法提高了生产，而且是永远地保障了压延工人的生命的安全。小型厂的党委会毫不迟疑地决定了把张明山的“反围盘”试验安排在九月份的技术组织措施计划〔注九〕里去，并分配党总支的组织委员下去具体帮助张明山。
    一九五二年的九月十四日，这就是预定试验张明山的“反围盘”的日子。张明山这一天是又高兴又害怕，高兴的是他费了几年苦心的“反围盘”，今天有机会试验试验了；害怕的是，工厂停止了生产来试验他的“反围盘”，万一不好使，这可怎么能受得住。那按照他的设计经过同志们共同努力做出来的“反围盘”开始安装的时候，他的全身紧张到了极点。
    一切试验的准备工作都做好了，只听厂长说了一声：“来一根吧。”那钢条，全身通红，火光逼人，就从毛轧机那边，飕飕地过来了。张明山这时心里乱跳，满脸的汗珠，籁籁地落下来。只听那钢条噹的一声，就停住了，没有钻进轧钢机的导板里去。张明山一看这，脸唰的白了。这时候，小型厂党委会的副书记康兆文正站在他旁边，只听他说：“有门儿，只是嘴子角度不对。”那老康本是个压延工人，张明山听他说有门，他的心呼拉一下定下来了。厂长继续指挥着大家把嘴子、导板调整了一下以后喊道：“再来一根！”几百只眼睛看着钢条顺着滚道爬过来，到了“反围盘”前，一转眼就进了轧钢机，弯弯绕绕，在轧钢机前后，飕飕地过去了。整个车间响起了雷一般的掌声。
    工人们把张明山火热热地围在当中，燕鸣厂长跑过来抱住了他，说：“张明山，你可给咱们小型厂解决了大问题了。”工人们的喜欢更是难以形容，吕长宽挤到张明山的跟前，他拍着老张的肩膀说：“有了你这个‘反围盘’，我就能多活十年。”
    开头的情况是很好的，一根根的钢条都飕飕地过去了。二十二公厘直径的钢条，用了“反围盘”，生产能力很快提高了百分之十五·四。但后来，在轧更粗一些的二十五公厘直径钢条的时候，生产的情况就发生了波动。那钢条一过来，有时就把嘴子打得一丈多远，一个晚上，合乎规格的成品有二百多根，废了的有一百八十根。没有办法继续干下去，只好把“反围盘”卸下来，恢复用人力干。
    这一天又高兴又沉重，高兴的是“反围盘”肯定是好使的，它基本上可以说是成功了；沉重的是发生了新问题，瞪着眼没法解决。
    燕鸣和康兆文，他们从早晨到半夜，没有吃什么东西，他们回到厂长办公室，还继续在为“反围盘”发愁。这一夜，燕鸣是到了三点多钟才睡着的。人们都睡了，他还在想：无论如何不要让机器管着我们，我们是一定要指挥机器的。他想那个不好用的嘴子，自己和自己商量说：请锻造厂打个铁的扁嘴子，那也许能行。
    第二天，“反围盘”又装上试验了，由于嘴子问题还是没有解决，生产情况一会好，一会坏，好像发疟疾一样。按照每天的生产任务算一算，已经拉下了好几百吨钢材没有完成。人们像面对一个沉重的病人，干瞪眼，没有一点点救治的办法。到了后来，质量又发生问题了，那经过“反围盘”出来的圆圆的钢条，身上都挂着一条一公厘深两公厘宽的道道，根根都有，成百吨的钢材都是这样。工人们不断把嘴子卸下来修理，总是无法解决，这真使人着急万分。有的技术人员看见这样子，又动摇了，他们劝厂长还是把“反围盘”卸下来用老办法生产吧，这样白白耽误时间，生产任务就完不成了。燕鸣和康兆文很坚定，他们说：“卸下来了，就不能够知道毛病在什么地方，就没有办法研究了。”说这话，他们两人已经六天六夜没有离开厂子了。
    眼看就要成功的东西，一下子有全部失败的危险，正在这个紧急的时候，幸亏苏联专家来了，专家看到这情形，马上动手帮助我们改变了嘴子的形状。这一来，“反围盘”的试验才算最后大功告成，产量马上就正常起来了，质量的问题也随着解决了。
    “反围盘”的试验最后成功，这就使光轧的生产能力很快地提高了百分之四十。这个“反围盘”，总共花钱不过三百万元，它为国家每年创造了五百二十七亿元的财富。特别是原来在光轧机上工作的十八名工人，他们就可以改做别的工作，他们就不必再冒着生命的危险，不必再在火烤、水淋和冷风吹打下工作了。
    只经过了七个多月的时间
    张明山的“反围盘”试验成功了，这在小型厂，好像是点着了一把火。这把火，把每个人的创造的热情燃烧起来了。这把火，它使人们活生生地看到了走向机械化自动化的灿烂的前程。
    从此，小型厂的人们就不再对那些恶劣的、半人力半机械的设备表示没有办法了。他们在加热炉前，在轧钢机前，在剪断机和冷却床前，他们充满了信心要改造那些令人厌恶的旧设备。
    卢乃涛是一个加热工人〔注十〕。他们工作起来身体要挨着一千多度的高热，从加热炉里，四个人每分钟用抽钢钩和绳索要拉出三根二百八十斤重的燃烧着的钢坯。卢乃涛在加热炉前已经工作了十七年，他的脖子、身上、手脚长满的伤疤，是他的工作留给他的痛苦的记忆。
    两年以前他也曾捉摸着想用一种机器来代替加热炉前的人工的操作，他用过去日本人设计的一架机器作过试验，但结果是失败了。
    “反围盘”的试验成功，把全厂的人的眼睛都引导着向机械化自动化的美妙的远景。
    有一次，技术员吴良亚看见了这架旧机器，他跑来问卢乃涛：“这机器为什么不能用啊。”
    “顶钢顶得太慢了。”
    吴良亚想：把马达加快一些不就可以了。他陪卢乃涛一块到了主电室，正好找到了一个每分钟一千四百五十二转的马达，他帮卢乃涛画图、设计，一试验快慢的问题解决了。但是又发现炉底有毛病，炉底高，推钢机的“大挺”〔注十一〕上不去，而且有时“大挺”还缩不回来，结果就被烧坏了。两个人一再试验，终是弄不好。
    有的技术人员提出了新建议，他们赞成用空气压缩机来带动它。并且说：“这样半自动化的办法，比过去用人力操作省事多了。”
    卢乃涛和吴良亚一致反对说，这样想不是开倒车了吗？怎么能让人跟着机器跑呢？
    推钢机上所发生的问题，很快给电气工人孙世平、李春泉、杨鹏飞知道了，他们解决了卢乃涛和吴良亚不能解决的问题。那个叫孙世平的，他在为推钢机做一种叫“限制开闭器”〔注十二〕零件的时候，他想到前些日子经过操作台，常见有一个人在摆手指挥从光轧机过来的管坯〔注十三〕，他摆摆手，前面就送来，但往往弄不对头，有时看着前面的过去了，就招呼后面的上来，机器一发生故障，前面后面的管坯就挤在一起。他想这地方根本用不着人，不用人，还能保证不出过去的毛病。他用了手掌大一块铁板，创造了冷却床上的自动拨铁机。冷却的管坯到了这里，再也不要人指挥，它能自动地上去，自动地走开，前面的不走开，后面的也不会上来了。
    仅仅是经过了七个多月的时间，群众性的机械化自动化运动已经改变了小型厂的原来的容貌，它使小型厂劳动生产率提高了百分之四十一·五，国家因此每年可以增加二千六百零四亿元的收入，并从根本上改进了劳动保护工作。
    现在你到小型厂去，那加热炉前只有一个工人坐在那里，他只要一按电钮，自动推钢机就从加热炉里推出一根烧红的钢坯，而后边的推料机马上自动地送上来一根冷钢坯。毛轧机前的自动翻钢机，是工程师周任源和康兆文两个人合作的。钢坯到了翻钢机跟前，在机器两边自动打滚翻身，又自动地在轧钢机里钻来钻去。光轧机上有张明山创造的“反围盘”，细长的通红的钢条，自动地在轧钢机前后驯服地在绕圈行走，轧钢的主要工序都逐渐实行机械化、自动化了，人们永远告别了过去那种难以令人容忍的劳动条件，开辟了一条新的道路。
    在轧管坯的轧钢机前，本来工人们要在一千多度的高温下操作，脸孔、胸前和肚皮上都烤得变了颜色，皮肤绷得紧紧的像块乾木板一样。现在，工人张祝山创造了一个“立围盘”，它能够使烧红的管胚自己上来，自己弯腰，自己进入轧钢机，工人在那里只要偶然调整一下机器就可以工作了。
    卷线机也不必再用人管理了，钢条来了，它就自动转动，卷完了，它就能自动停止，而且能自动卸下来。
    连轧一根钢要用几秒钟，每个钟头轧了多少根，机器停止了多少时间，也有一个自动记录器在代理人工计算了。
    各种各样的机器，还正在不断地设计，不断地铸制和安装。车间的门口，混凝土的地基已经打好，这里马上就要装上一架运料机，钢坯到了小型厂的门口，它就可以自动运到加热炉去。
    小型厂正从一个设备非常落后和恶劣的工厂改造成为一个机械化自动化的工厂。它像一盏灯，给全国原有的工厂，照亮了一条理想的道路——向机械化自动化前进的道路。
