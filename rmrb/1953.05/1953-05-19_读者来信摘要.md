Reader's Letters Summary

Reader's Letters Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement Protesting the US Government's Provocative Actions
--Reader's Letters Overview

Since our newspaper published Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on May 12 protesting the US aircraft's violation of our country's airspace and the killing and wounding of our people, readers have sent letters expressing extreme anger at the US government's provocative actions and aggressive crimes, and supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. The Senior Third Class B of Beijing Municipal No. 3 Middle School wrote: "When the people of the world are eager to reach a ceasefire agreement quickly, we heard the news that the US invading air force to Korea once again violated our country's airspace and killed and injured more than 260 of our people. All of our classmates are very angry. This is obviously a serious provocation by US imperialism against our country and the peace-loving people of the world, and it is also a shameful act to try to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations." Lu Rulin of the Beijing Public Security Traffic Brigade wrote: The US invading air force to Korea used brutal means to kill and injure our peaceful residents, proving that they still lack sincerity in the Korean peace talks. Yan Yuting of the Beijing Real Estate Management Bureau's Engineering Office wrote: "The US aggressor troops have repeatedly sent aircraft to violate our country's airspace and have repeatedly suffered head-on blows from our air defense forces; but their bandit hearts are still not dead, and they have once again committed crimes. This action of theirs is obviously an attempt to obstruct the Korean peace talks."

All readers in their letters unanimously stated: The determination of the Chinese and Korean people to strive for peace is unshakable, and this provocative attempt by the US government will be met with a shameful failure.

The Agricultural Loan Issuance Work of the Shiting Business Office of the Liling County People's Bank Has Serious Shortcomings

Letters from readers Li Deyi and Luo Jianping of the Tenth District of Liling County, Hunan Province: This spring, when the Shiting Business Office of the People's Bank of Liling County, Hunan Province, issued spring plowing fertilizer loans, it adopted completely unrealistic and seriously divorced from the masses' erroneous practices. They arbitrarily stipulated: No one is allowed to receive a loan without a purchase voucher. The fact is obvious that poor farmers who need loans have no money to buy production materials before they receive the loan, so they will not have a purchase voucher. Therefore, many poor farmers who are seriously lacking in production materials and should be eligible for loans cannot receive loans. The farmers have a lot of complaints about this. In the loan work, the business office adopted the so-called "three guarantees" approach in order to save trouble, that is, it requires township cadres to guarantee loans, guarantee inspections, and guarantee collection. This makes the township cadres very embarrassed. Luo Yifan, a cadre of Daguanzhong Township, said: "The bank wants me to 'three guarantees,' and I have 'four fears':

\t1. I am afraid that if I lend to you and not to him, someone will raise objections; 2. I am afraid that inspection will be difficult; 3. I am afraid that I will not be able to recover the money and will have to pay compensation; 4. I am afraid that if I do not do a good job, the bank will criticize me." In addition, farmers who want loans must also find someone to guarantee responsibility, and mutual aid teams must have the team leader responsible for the loans. Many individual farmers—especially poor households—cannot find someone to be responsible for the loans for a while, so they cannot get loans. For example, in the 2.45 million yuan loan of the Third Joint Group of Early He Kun Township, 41 households of farmers participating in the mutual aid group received loans, totaling 2.4 million yuan; only one individual farmer received a loan, totaling 50,000 yuan. Poor farmer Chen Yingxiang and other six individual households were seriously short of fertilizer, but they did not receive loans. This violates the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instruction to make a "reasonable allocation in both the organized farmers and individual farmers" in agricultural loans.

We believe that the business office adopted lazy and irresponsible methods in issuing agricultural loans because it was afraid of taking responsibility and afraid of doing hard and in-depth work, so that the loan could not play the role of supporting agricultural production. This is wrong. It is hoped that the People's Bank of Liling County will quickly correct the above-mentioned erroneous practices of the business office.

The People's Banks in Wei County, Hebei Province, and Other Places Should Not Restrict Loans to Poor Farmers

A letter from Xiaonong of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative: The agricultural loan work of the People's Bank of Wei County, Hebei Province, this spring has serious shortcomings. The bank mechanically stipulates: Those who borrowed more than 600,000 yuan in 1952 and have not yet repaid it will not be given a loan this year. In this way, on the one hand, many poor farmers who are indeed unable to repay their old loans cannot get government support, and their production is affected. On the other hand, a large number of loans are piled up in the bank's vault. Of the first batch of 4 billion yuan in spring fertilizer loans in the county, only 1.9 billion yuan had been lent out by April 19. As a result, the fertilizer prepared by the cooperative for farmers to supply could not be sold, and 60% of it was still in stock. It is understood that other counties in Zhangjiakou Prefecture have similar situations. This is a serious problem. It is hoped that the Zhangjiakou Central Branch of the People's Bank of China will quickly conduct an inspection of this and improve the agricultural loan work of its subordinate branches so that the national agricultural loans can truly play a role in supporting farmers' production.

The People's Bank of Zhengyang County, Henan Province, Should Not Use Coercive Means to Collect Loans from Farmers

A letter from reader Xinsheng: The People's Bank of Zhengyang County, Henan Province, has serious bureaucracy and commandism in its agricultural loan work, which has created an extremely bad influence among the farmers.

Last November, the bank sent a dozen cadres to various villages in Hanzhuang Township in the Second District to collect loans. At that time, the township was busy with autumn grain collection work, but the bank cadres who went to Yu Lou Village forced the masses to hold meetings and announced that 80% of the old loans had to be repaid that day, and the acceptance would be the next day. Township government members Yu Hongzhang and Huang Tianfu successively represented the masses in proposing to repay the loans after the public grain was handed in, but were unreasonably rejected by the bank cadres. The bank cadres also went to each household to collect the loans and were very rude in their attitude; many farmers were so frightened that they hid. Poor farmer Yu Tianqing said a word at the meeting and was scolded by the bank cadres as a "bad guy taking advantage of loopholes." In addition, he owed more than 200 jin of grain in loans and could not repay it for a while. When he returned home, he was so anxious and scared that he hanged himself that night (fortunately, he was rescued and did not die). Loan user Zhang Deren could not repay the loan for a while, and the bank cadres threatened him to tie him up and send him to the district government, forcing him to repay the loan with the prepared public grain. Some farmers borrowed money to buy livestock, but were forced to sell the livestock to repay the loans. The bank cadres' actions aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the masses, and some farmers said:

"I would rather starve to death in the future than borrow money."

The reason for the above problems is inseparable from the bureaucratic style of Liu Yiyuan, the president of the People's Bank of Zhengyang County (member of the Zhengyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China). When arranging the loan collection work, Liu Yiyuan put forward the slogan of "reward for completing the task ahead of schedule," but did not simultaneously explain the specific working methods; after arranging the work, he just sat in the office and urged the lower-level cadres to submit reports, without making specific leadership and inspection. Therefore, the lower-level cadres simply pursued the completion of the task and did not hesitate to use any means. As a result, not only were the old loans not collected, but also the autumn grain collection work in Hanzhuang Township could not be completed in time. More seriously, the prestige of the Party and the people's government was greatly damaged. After the incident occurred, a cadre in the Second District wrote a letter to the Yuannan People's Daily to expose it. The Yuannan People's Daily forwarded the original letter to the bank. Liu Yiyuan did not inspect the bank's work, but criticized the Second District for not paying attention to the loan collection work, and wrote a letter to the newspaper saying that the criticism was not true. Therefore, the work style of the bank cadres has not been improved so far.

It is recommended that the Zhengyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government inspect the above incidents and conduct serious handling in order to restore the adverse effects caused among the masses.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    读者来信拥护周外长声明抗议美国政府的挑衅行动
    ——读者来信综述
    五月十二日本报发表了周恩来外长关于抗议美机侵犯我国领空，杀伤我国人民的声明以后，读者纷纷来信，对美国政府这一挑衅行动和侵略罪行极表愤怒，并拥护周外长的严正声明。北京市立第三中学高中三乙班来信说：“当全世界人民渴望迅速达成停战协议的时候，我们听到美国侵朝空军再一次地侵犯我国领空，杀伤我国人民达二百六十余人的消息，我们全体同学都非常愤怒。这显然是美帝国主义向我国和全世界爱好和平人民的严重挑衅，同时也是企图阻碍朝鲜停战谈判的可耻行为。”北京市公安交通大队吕如琳来信说：美国侵朝空军用残暴的手段杀伤我国和平居民，证明了他对朝鲜和平谈判仍然缺乏诚意。北京市房地产管理局工程处阎玉廷来信说：“美国侵略军多次派飞机侵犯我国领空，多次遭受我国防空部队的迎头痛击；但他们的贼心还不死，又一次地制造罪恶。他这一行动显然是企图阻碍朝鲜和平谈判。”
    所有来信的读者一致表示：中朝人民争取和平的决心是不可动摇的，美国政府这一挑衅企图必将遭到可耻的失败。
    醴陵县人民银行石亭营业所农贷发放工作中有严重缺点
    湖南醴陵县第十区读者黎德毅、罗剑平来信：今春湖南省醴陵县人民银行石亭营业所发放春耕肥料贷款时，采取了完全不切合实际和严重脱离群众的错误做法。他们擅自规定：没有购货单据的，就不准领取贷款。事实很明显，要求贷款的贫困农民在没有领到贷款之前，根本没钱买生产资料，也就不会有购货单据。因此，有不少严重缺乏生产资料应该受贷的农民领不到贷款。农民们对此很有意见。该营业所在贷款工作中，为了贪图省事而采取了所谓“三包”的做法，就是在贷款时要乡干部包贷、包检查、包收。这就使乡干部很为难。大观仲乡干部罗异凡说：“银行要我‘三包’，我有‘四怕’：
    一怕贷给你不贷给他，有人提意见；二怕检查有困难；三怕收不回要赔；四怕搞不好，银行要批评。”此外，要贷款的农民还得找人担保负责，互助组要贷款有组长负责，不少个体农民——尤其是贫困户要贷款就一时找不到人负责，因而也就贷不到款。如早禾坤乡第三联组二百四十五万元贷款中，参加互助组的农民得到贷款的是四十一户，二百四十万元；单干农民得到贷款的只一户，五万元。贫农陈英香等六户单干户严重缺肥，可是却没有得到贷款。这和中共中央指示的把农业贷款“在组织起来的农民和个体农民两方面做合理的分配”的精神是违背的。
    我们认为：该营业所发放农贷时怕负责任、怕作艰苦深入的工作，而采用偷懒取巧和不负责任的办法，致使贷款不能起支援农业生产的作用，这是错误的。希望醴陵县人民银行迅速纠正该营业所以上的错误做法。
    河北蔚县等地人民银行不应限制贫困农民贷款
    华北供销合作总社晓农来信：河北省蔚县人民银行今年春耕贷款工作有严重缺点。该行机械规定：凡一九五二年贷款在六十万元以上，而至今没有偿还者，今年不再贷给款项。这样，一方面使得很多确实无力偿还旧贷款的贫困农民，得不到政府扶持，生产受到影响。另一方面，又使大批的贷款都积压在银行的金库里。该县第一批春季肥料贷款四十亿元，到四月十九日才贷出十九亿元。而合作社准备供给农民的肥料，也因而卖不出去，有百分之六十还积压着。据了解，张家口专区其他县也有类似情况。这是一个严重问题。希望中国人民银行张家口中心支行迅速对此进行检查，改进所属各支行的农贷工作，使国家农业贷款真正起到支持农民生产的作用。
    河南正阳县人民银行不应该用强迫手段向农民收要贷款
    读者新生来信：河南省正阳县人民银行在农贷工作中有严重的官僚主义和强迫命令作风，在农民群众中造成极端恶劣的影响。
    去年十一月间，该行派了十几个干部分别到二区韩庄乡各村催收贷款。当时该乡正忙着做秋征工作，到余楼村的银行干部却逼着群众开会，宣布当天要还回旧贷款百分之八十，第二天就要验收。乡政府委员余鸿章、黄天福先后代表群众提出交完公粮再还贷款的意见，都被银行干部无理拒绝。银行干部还分头挨户催收，而且态度恶劣；不少农民都吓得躲起来了。该村贫农余天庆在会上说了一句话，被银行干部骂为“坏家伙钻空子”，再加上他欠了二百多斤粮食的贷款一时还不出，回家后又急又怕，当晚就上吊自杀（幸被抢救未死）。贷款户张得仁一时还不出贷款，银行干部威胁他，要把他捆送区政府，逼得他把准备好的公粮还了贷款。有的农民贷了款买牲口，结果又被迫卖了牲口还贷款。银行干部这种做法引起群众极端不满，有的农民说：
    “以后饿死也不贷款了。”
    产生以上问题的原因，是和正阳县人民银行行长刘沂元（中共正阳县委委员）的官僚主义作风分不开的。刘沂元在布置收贷工作时，提出了“提前完成任务有奖”的口号，但却不同时交代具体工作方法；布置工作后只是坐在办公室里向下级干部催要报告，而不作具体的领导和检查。因此，下级干部就单纯追求完成任务，而不择手段。这样做的结果，不但旧贷款收不齐，而且影响了韩庄乡秋征工作不能及时完成，更严重的是大大损害了党和人民政府的威信。在事件发生后，二区一个干部写信向豫南人民报揭发。豫南人民报把原信转给该行，刘沂元不检查银行工作，反而批评二区不重视收贷工作，并写信给报社说是批评不实。因此，该行干部的工作作风至今还是没有改进。
    建议正阳县中共县委和人民政府检查以上事件，并进行严肃处理，以挽回在群众中造成的不良影响。
