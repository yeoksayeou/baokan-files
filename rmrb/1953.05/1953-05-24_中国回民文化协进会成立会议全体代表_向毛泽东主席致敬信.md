    To the Esteemed Chairman Mao:

    We, the representatives attending the inaugural meeting of the China Hui Muslim Culture Advancement Association, extend to you our most lofty respect and heartfelt gratitude.

    We Hui people, in the past era of reactionary rule, especially under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, suffered cruel exploitation and oppression. At that time, the Hui people had no political rights whatsoever, lived in poverty, and were culturally backward.

    Under your wise leadership, we Hui people, along with all the people of all nationalities across the country, have gained liberation. For more than three years, thanks to the correct implementation of your ethnic policies by the People's Government, we Hui people have achieved development and progress in political, economic, and cultural aspects. Our Hui people and the Han people, as well as all fraternal ethnic groups across the country, are more united, and we live together in the great family of the People's Republic of China in friendship and cooperation. Hui people living in concentrated communities have established or are establishing autonomous regions, and Hui people living in mixed communities with fraternal ethnic groups have representatives participating in the local people's governments, and the rights of ethnic equality have been guaranteed. Hui people in rural areas have been allocated land in the land reform, and Hui people in urban areas, with the help of the People's Government, have found re-employment and employment, which has not only solved their livelihood difficulties but also allowed them to participate in the great construction of the motherland. Hui schools have also been widely developed, the number of Hui children attending school is increasing daily, and the number of Hui cadres is growing daily. The customs and religious beliefs of the Hui people have also been respected. All of this marks the rebirth of the Hui people and a brand new era in the historical development of the Hui people.

    Dear Chairman Mao, we deeply know that all the happiness of us Hui people today is given to us by you.

    In order to create a better tomorrow, the vast number of Hui people across the country are actively involved in the upsurge of the great construction of the motherland. Our China Hui Muslim Culture Advancement Association will assist the People's Government in researching and developing the cultural and educational undertakings of the Hui people, strengthen patriotic education among the Hui people, and mobilize the Hui people to work hard to learn scientific knowledge, production technology, and the production experience of advanced ethnic groups, so as to contribute more effectively to the great economic construction that has already begun in the motherland. We firmly believe that under your wise leadership, our Hui people, like all nationalities across the country, have a future that is infinitely bright and far-reaching.

    Finally, we sincerely wish you eternal health!

    中国回民文化协进会成立会议全体代表
    向毛泽东主席致敬信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们出席中国回民文化协进会成立会议的全体代表，谨向您致以最崇高的敬礼和衷心的感谢。
    我们回族人民，在过去反动统治时代，特别是在国民党反动派统治时代，受尽了残酷的剥削和压迫。那时候，回族人民在政治上没有丝毫权利，生活贫困，文化落后。
    在您的英明领导下，我们回族人民与全国各民族人民一道获得了解放。三年多来，由于人民政府正确实施了您的民族政策，我们回族人民在政治、经济、文化各方面都获得了发展和进步。我们回族和汉族以及全国各兄弟民族更加团结了，我们各民族友爱合作地共同生活在中华人民共和国大家庭中。聚居的回民已经建立或正在建立自治区，与兄弟民族人民杂居的回民都有代表参加了当地人民政权，民族平等的权利得到了保障。农村中的回民在土地改革中分得了土地，城市的回民在人民政府的帮助下，许多人得到转业和就业，不仅解决了生活上的困难，而且参加了祖国的伟大建设事业。回民学校也普遍地发展起来了，回族入学儿童日在增多，回族干部日在成长。回族的风俗习惯宗教信仰也受到了尊重。这一切，标志着回族的新生，标志着回族历史发展的崭新的时代。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们深深地知道，我们回族人民今天的一切幸福，都是您给我们的。
    为了创造更美好的明天，全国广大的回族人民都积极地投入了祖国大建设的热潮中。我们中国回民文化协进会，将协助人民政府研究和发展回民的文化教育事业，在回民中加强爱国主义教育，发动回族人民努力学习科学知识、生产技术，学习先进民族的生产经验，以便在祖国已经开始的伟大经济建设事业中，更有效地贡献出自己的力量。我们深信，在您的英明领导下，我们回族和全国各民族一样，前途是无限光明和远大的。
    最后，衷心地祝您永远健康！
