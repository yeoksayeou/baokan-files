    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has completed its entire agenda, made all its important resolutions, and has victoriously concluded. People will see that the achievements of this congress will increasingly and significantly demonstrate its enormous role in the great cause of our country's industrialization and in the struggle for the unity of the international workers' movement and the defense of world peace. The achievements of this congress mark a new historical period in the development of the Chinese workers' movement and trade union work.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class, after a long and heroic struggle, has not only proven itself to be the leading force in the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, but has also proven itself to be the leading force in the construction of New China. Since the Sixth National Labor Congress in 1948, especially after the nationwide liberation, the ranks of the Chinese working class have grown more rapidly, the political consciousness of the working masses has also been rapidly raised, and they have been more widely organized in Chinese trade unions, making great contributions to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, supporting the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and restoring the national economy, winning brilliant victories. It is precisely because of such brilliant victories that our country can now enter a new historical period of economic construction. The arrival of this new historical period has presented the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country with new and great historical tasks, requiring our working class to give play to our leading and vanguard role in the cause of national construction a hundredfold or a thousandfold.
    Comrade Mao Zedong had already foreseen in 1945 in "On Coalition Government" that "the task of the Chinese working class is not only to struggle for the establishment of a new democratic state, but also to struggle for China's industrialization and the modernization of agriculture." In 1949, in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The state of the people's democratic dictatorship must solve the problem of the industrialization of this country step by step." Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his congratulatory speech at the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, declared on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: "Our motherland is now entering a new historical period and has put forward new historical tasks to us, that is, the task of realizing the industrialization of our country and gradually transitioning to a socialist society." Comrade Liu Shaoqi continued: "The victorious completion of this historical task will greatly enrich and strengthen our country and people, but this is particularly dependent on the Chinese working class making a more organized and more conscious struggle." Comrade Liu Shaoqi's congratulatory speech comprehensively explained the guiding principles of our Party Central Committee for the Chinese workers' movement and trade union work entering the new period of national construction. According to these guiding principles, the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, after heated discussions, unanimously adopted resolutions on the report on the work of Chinese trade unions, the report on amending the Constitution of Chinese Trade Unions, and the report on trade union financial work, and adopted the Constitution of Chinese Trade Unions, specifically defining the basic tasks and political and organizational work programs of the workers' movement and trade union work in our country for a future historical period.
    In order to implement the guiding principles of our Party Central Committee for the workers' movement and trade union work in the new historical period, in order to implement the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, in order to give play to the great role of our working class in the cause of national construction a hundredfold or a thousandfold, we must vigorously strengthen the work of trade unions and earnestly do as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his congratulatory speech, "so that the work of trade unions in the future can be further improved under the leadership of the Party, and that our trade unions can truly become 'builders of a new life' and 'educators of new millions of people,' as Lenin said." This work is extremely glorious and extremely arduous; however, this work has more favorable conditions than ever before. Any view that underestimates the importance of trade union work is unfounded. The key issue to be resolved here is to universally establish a Leninist view of trade union work.
    Our Party has consistently adhered to the Leninist viewpoint on trade union work. According to this viewpoint, under the leadership of the Party, trade unions must become schools for the working masses to learn management, schools for learning to manage the economy, and schools for learning communism. The Constitution of Chinese Trade Unions adopted by this congress was formulated according to this viewpoint. However, as Lenin pointed out in his report to the Second All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions in 1919: "Educating the masses to do management work is not a matter of empty talk, not teaching by lecturing, not teaching by holding meetings, but teaching by experience. The proletariat has contributed a number of advanced elements from among themselves to do command work and organization work. This is not enough; we must do this so that more and more people enter these parts, and a new batch of workers go to the positions where those advanced elements originally stood. This is still not enough; we must do this so that ten times more new people join in than before." May I ask whether every one of our comrades has taken such a view of trade union work? If anyone has not yet established such a view, then they should not hesitate to establish such a view as soon as possible. Establishing such a view is necessary for realizing the tasks of Chinese trade unions in the new era. Only with such a view can trade union workers work hard to learn, go deep into the masses, and lead the masses forward; only with such a view can administrative work and other leading cadres understand how to rely on trade unions, rely on the working masses, and correctly unite workers, technicians, and staff to better manage enterprises.
    If we want to prevent trade unions from educating the working masses to learn economic management from becoming empty talk, we must carry it out through the regular and primary central work of trade unions. This is to thoroughly launch healthy and regular labor competitions, strengthen labor discipline, promote rationalization proposals and advanced experiences, improve labor productivity, tap the potential of enterprises, increase the quantity of products, improve product quality, reduce production costs, ensure production safety, and complete and over fulfill production plans. On the basis of increased production, we must gradually improve the material and cultural life and working conditions of workers as necessary and possible. Here, we must prevent the tendency of one-sidedly emphasizing welfare issues, allowing the relaxation of labor discipline, economicism and trade unionism that deviate from the leadership of the Party, and at the same time, we must overcome the phenomena of formalism and bureaucracy in organizing and leading production competitions. Comrade Stalin said in his article "Mass Competition and the Upsurge of Labor Enthusiasm" written in May 1929: "Competition is advanced people helping backward people with a comrade's attitude, and its purpose is to achieve common progress." "Socialist competition cannot be seen as a matter of the office; socialist competition is the expression of the masses' realistic self-criticism, which relies on the creative initiative of the millions of working masses. Anyone who consciously or unconsciously hinders this self-criticism and this creative initiative of the masses should be removed as an obstacle to our great cause." We should follow Comrade Stalin's instructions to carry out rationalization proposal movements, criticism and self-criticism, and oppose bureaucracy and formalism in leading the production competition of the working masses. Only through such a production competition full of mass creativity can we complete and over fulfill the country's economic plans, and only then can we educate millions of workers to gradually learn the skills of economic management.
    The leading organs and leading cadres of our Party at all levels must constantly strengthen the leadership of trade union work. What needs to be prevented here are the two tendencies of monopolizing and letting things drift. Party committees at all levels should seriously discuss the reports and resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, lead trade union work cadres to implement them, and practically strengthen the work of industrial trade unions according to local specific conditions and actual needs; at the same time, they must also strengthen the leadership of local trade unions, strengthen the organizational leadership and education work of local trade unions for scattered public-private enterprises and handicraft workers in small and medium-sized towns. Party committees at all levels should supervise and check the study of trade union work cadres, so that trade union work cadres truly understand the Party's various policies and guidelines in the new historical period, and can correctly analyze the situation and adopt correct mass work methods, rather than mechanically applying a set of experiences and rigid formulas. Trade union organizations at all levels should systematically conduct socialist and communist education to the working class masses under the direct leadership and specific assistance of Party committees at all levels, and systematically cultivate and train trade union activists and cadres. We must strengthen the leadership of the working class's vanguard—the Communist Party—over the mass organization of its own class—the trade union—so as to give full play to the leading role of the entire working class in the cause of national construction.
    The Chinese working class today more clearly sees that the responsibilities we bear for the construction of our motherland and the responsibilities we must bear internationally are unified and inseparable. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his speech to the congress: "In addition to the domestic responsibilities mentioned above, the Chinese working class must also bear serious international responsibilities, that is to say, the Chinese working class must strive for the unity of the working class of the whole country, must strive for the unity of the international workers' movement under the leadership of the World Federation, and must strive for the defense of world peace and security together with the working class and progressive humanity of all countries in the world. The victorious Chinese working class must sincerely give all kinds of assistance to the working class and working people of capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries. This is a glorious and unavoidable responsibility, and the Chinese trade unions must strengthen this aspect of their work in the future so that this aspect of their work can be done better." This is the goal we will unswervingly strive for. The General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Louis Saillant, and the delegation of the Soviet Trade Union and the delegations of various trade union organizations from Asia, Europe, Australia, and Africa, participated in the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and were warmly welcomed; the congress also adopted a resolution on supporting the World Federation of Trade Unions to convene the Third World Trade Union Congress and sent representatives, which once again demonstrated the increasingly close unity between the Chinese working class and the working class of all countries in the world. The growth of this unity is a decisive factor in the inevitable victory of the cause of peace defended by all peace-loving people in the world.
    Our working class and the people of the whole country are today more full of confidence in victory than ever before. We must support each other with the international working class and all peace-loving people, and strive for the unity of the international workers' movement and the cause of defending world peace. In the new period of national construction, under the noble friendly assistance of the great Soviet Union, we must strive to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and strive to realize the tasks of the mass organization of the Chinese working class—the Chinese Trade Union—in the new period, that is, to realize the industrialization of our country and gradually transition to a socialist society.

### 为实现中国工会新时期的任务而斗争

    为实现中国工会新时期的任务而斗争
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会完成了它的全部议程，做出了各项重大的决议，已经胜利闭幕了。人们会看到这个大会的成就，将在我们国家工业化的伟大事业中，在为国际工人运动的统一和保卫世界和平而进行的斗争中，日益显著地表现出它的巨大作用。这个大会的成就，标志了中国工人运动和工会工作发展的一个新的历史时期。
    在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，经过长期英勇斗争的中国工人阶级，不但已经证明自己是中国人民革命事业的领导力量，而且已经证明自己是新中国建设事业的领导力量。从一九四八年第六次全国劳动大会召开以后，特别是在全国解放以后，中国工人阶级的队伍更加迅速地壮大起来，工人群众的政治觉悟也在迅速地提高起来，并且更加广泛地组织在中国工会之中，为巩固人民民主专政、支持抗美援朝斗争、恢复国民经济而做了巨大的贡献，赢得了光辉的胜利。正是由于这样光辉的胜利，才使我们的国家能够从现在开始进入新的经济建设的历史时期。而这个新的历史时期的到来，又向中国工人阶级和全国人民提出了新的伟大的历史任务，它要求我国工人阶级更加千百倍地发挥我们在国家建设事业中的领导作用和先锋作用。
    毛泽东同志还在一九四五年“论联合政府”中就已预见到今天“中国工人阶级的任务，不但是为着建立新民主主义的国家而斗争，而且是为着中国的工业化和农业近代化而斗争。”在一九四九年“论人民民主专政”中，毛泽东同志又指出：“人民民主专政的国家，必须有步骤地解决这个国家工业化的问题。”刘少奇同志在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上的祝词中，代表中国共产党中央明确地宣布：“我们祖国现在开始进入一个新的历史时期，并向我们提出了新的历史任务，这就是实现我们国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会的任务。”刘少奇同志继续指出：“这个历史任务的胜利完成，将使我们的国家和人民大大富强起来，但这是特别有赖于中国工人阶级作更有组织和更高觉悟的斗争的。”刘少奇同志的祝词全面地说明了我们的党中央对于我国工人运动和工会工作进入国家建设的新时期的指导方针。根据这个指导方针，中国工会第七次全国代表大会经过热烈的讨论，一致通过了关于中国工会工作的报告、关于修改中国工会章程的报告和关于工会财务工作的报告等决议，并通过了中国工会章程，具体地确定了我国今后一个历史时期的工人运动和工会工作的各项基本任务及政治的、组织的工作纲领。
    为了贯彻实现我们党中央在新的历史时期对于工人运动和工会工作的指导方针，为了贯彻实现中国工会第七次全国代表大会的决议，为了千百倍地发挥我国工人阶级在国家建设事业中的伟大作用，我们必须用大力加强工会的工作，切实做到刘少奇同志在祝词中所说的那样，“使今后工会的工作在党的领导下能够得到更多的改进，使我们的工会能够如列宁所说的那样，真正成为‘新生活的建设者’，成为‘新的千百万人的教育者’。”这个工作是极其光荣的，也是极其艰巨的；但是，这个工作却具备了以往任何时候所没有的便利条件。任何对于工会工作的重要性认识不足的观点都是毫无根据的。这里要解决的一个关键问题，就是要普遍地树立对于工会工作的列宁主义的观点。
    我们的党对于工会工作是一贯坚持列宁主义观点的。根据这种观点，工会必须在党的领导下成为工人群众学习管理的学校，学习主持经济的学校，学习共产主义的学校。这次大会所通过的中国工会章程就是根据这种观点来制订的。但是，正如列宁在
    一九一九年第二次全俄职工代表大会上的报告中所指出的：“教育群众做管理工作，不是纸上谈兵的，不是用演讲来教，不是用开会来教，而是用经验来教。无产阶级从自己中间供献了一批先进分子，做指挥工作、组织工作。这是不够的，我们要这样做，要使得更多更多的人进入这些部分，要有
    一批又一批新的工人去站到原来那些先进分子所站的地位去。这还是不够，我们又要这样做，要使得比以前多十倍的新人再加入进去。”试问我们的同志是不是每一个人都采取这样的观点来看待工会工作了呢？如果谁还没有树立这样的观点，那末，现在就应该毫不迟疑地赶快树立起这样的观点来。树立这样的观点是为了实现中国工会在新时期的工作任务所必需的。工会工作者有了这样的观点才能努力学习，深入群众，领导群众前进；行政工作方面和其他方面的领导干部有了这样的观点，才能懂得怎样依靠工会，依靠工人群众，正确地团结工人、技术人员和职员，把企业管理得更好。
    要想使工会教育工人群众学习管理经济的工作不致成为纸上谈兵，就必须通过工会的经常和首要的中心工作来进行。这就是要深入展开健全的经常性的劳动竞赛，加强劳动纪律，推广合理化建议和先进经验，提高劳动生产率，发掘企业的潜在力量，增加产品数量、提高产品质量、降低生产成本、确保生产安全、完成和超额完成生产计划。而在增加生产的基础上，又必须按照必要和可能逐步改善工人的物质和文化生活及工作条件。在这里要防止片面强调福利问题、放任劳动纪律废弛、脱离党的领导的经济主义和工联主义的倾向，同时也要克服在组织和领导生产竞赛中的形式主义和官僚主义的现象。斯大林同志在一九二九年五月所写的
    “群众的竞赛和劳动热情的高涨”一文中说：“竞赛是先进的人以同志的态度帮助落后的人，其目的是为了达到共同前进。”“不能把社会主义竞赛看做是办公厅里的事情，社会主义竞赛是群众的实事求是的自我批评的表现，这种自我批评是依靠着千百万劳动群众的创造性的倡议。任何一个人，有意识地或无意识地阻碍这种自我批评和群众的这种创造性的倡议，都应该把他做为我们伟大事业的障碍而清除出去。”我们应该按照斯大林同志的指示，在领导工人群众的生产竞赛中开展合理化建议运动，开展批评和自我批评，反对官僚主义和形式主义。只有通过这样充满群众创造性的生产竞赛，我们才有可能完成和超额完成国家的经济计划，也才有可能教育千百万工人群众逐渐学习到管理经济的本领。
    我们党的各级领导机关和领导干部，必须经常加强对工会工作的领导。在这里要防止的是包办代替和放任自流的两种倾向。各级党委对于中国工会第七次全国代表大会的报告和决议应该认真地加以讨论，领导工会工作干部贯彻执行，并按照各地具体的情况和实际的需要，切实加强产业工会的工作；同时还必须加强对地方工会的领导，加强地方工会对中小城镇分散的公私企业和手工业工人的组织领导和教育工作。各级党委应督促检查工会工作干部的学习，务使工会工作干部真正懂得党在新的历史时期的各项政策方针，能够正确地分析情况，采取正确的群众工作方法，而不是生硬地搬用一套经验和死板的公式。各级工会组织应该在各级党的直接领导和具体帮助之下，系统地向工人阶级群众进行社会主义和共产主义的教育，并有计划地培养和训练工会的积极分子和干部。我们一定要使工人阶级的先锋队——共产党对自己阶级的群众组织——工会的领导日益加强起来，以便充分地发挥整个工人阶级在国家建设事业中的领导作用。
    中国工人阶级今天更清楚地看到我们为自己的祖国建设事业所担负的责任，和我们在国际上所必须担负的责任是统一不可分的。刘少奇同志在向大会致词中说：“中国工人阶级除开应该担负以上所说的国内的责任而外，还必须担负严重的国际责任，这就是说，中国工人阶级必须为全世界工人阶级的团结而奋斗，必须在世界工联的领导下为国际工人运动的统一而奋斗，必须同世界各国的工人阶级和进步人类一道为保卫世界的和平与安全而奋斗。胜利了的中国工人阶级对资本主义各国以及殖民地半殖民地各国的工人阶级和劳动人民，必须诚心诚意地给以各种援助。这是一种光荣的不可推脱的责任，中国工会必须在今后增强这方面工作，使这方面的工作能做得更好。”这是我们坚持不渝地努力的目标。这次世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬和苏联工会代表团及亚洲、欧洲、澳洲、非洲许多国家的各个工会组织的代表团，参加了中国工会第七次全国代表大会，受到热烈的欢迎；大会还通过了关于拥护世界工会联合会召开世界工会第三次代表大会的决议，并选派了代表，这又一次地表现了我国工人阶级和世界各国工人阶级日益亲密的团结。这种团结力量的增长，是全世界一切爱好和平人民保卫和平的事业必然胜利的决定因素。
    我国工人阶级和全国人民，今天比过去任何时候都更加充满着胜利的信心。我们一定要和国际工人阶级及一切爱好和平的人民互相支持，为国际工人运动的统一和保卫世界和平的事业而斗争。我们在祖国建设的新时期中，在伟大苏联的崇高的友谊援助之下，一定要为实现中国共产党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，为实现中国工人阶级群众组织——中国
    工会在新时期的工作任务，即为实现我们国家的工业化并逐步地过渡到社会主义社会的任务而斗争。
