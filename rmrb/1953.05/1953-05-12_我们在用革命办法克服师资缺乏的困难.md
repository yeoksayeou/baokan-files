    We are using revolutionary methods to overcome the difficulty of teacher shortage
    Zhongnan Mining and Metallurgy College, Mineral Processing Department
    I.
    Although the Mineral Processing Department of Zhongnan Mining and Metallurgy College has only three professors, one associate professor, and nine teaching assistants, its task is to offer eight specialized courses such as "Mineral Processing Principles" within one year. It also has to teach "Useful Mineral Processing" to nine classes in the mining and metallurgy departments. Generally speaking, manpower and tasks are disproportionate. What should we do? "Wait for the higher authorities to send more teachers," some of us did have such an idea, but according to our understanding, the Northeast Institute of Technology plans to set up a coal preparation group under the mining department, with only one professor; the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology plans to set up an iron ore beneficiation group under the mining department, with only two professors (one of whom has now been transferred to our college). Therefore, it is very difficult to "wait for the higher authorities to send more teachers." "Let a professor teach three courses," but facing unfamiliar professional teaching plans, each professor lacks confidence; moreover, with many students and textbooks needing to be rewritten, it is not easy for a professor to be responsible for teaching one course well, and teaching three courses will inevitably fail to guarantee quality; moreover, the number of students is increasing year by year, and the tasks are becoming greater and greater. Therefore, at the professional setup learning conference at the beginning of the semester, we realized that the shortage of teachers is a major difficulty in China's current education cause, and this is a difficulty in development. One of the effective ways to overcome this difficulty is to rely on everyone's efforts to cultivate new teachers with the revolutionary spirit and methods of mutual assistance and learning, and learning while teaching. That is, to allow young teaching assistants, under the guidance of professors based on self-study, to take on teaching tasks as soon as possible.
    However, at that time, there were still many ideological obstacles to implementing this method. The teaching assistants were uneasy about the unfamiliar profession and had no confidence in starting classes. Teaching assistant Huang Shu once said: "Even for the courses I have studied, I have to study with a professor for two years after graduation before I can start teaching. Isn't it risky to start a new course immediately?" Most teaching assistants thought: It's better to study with the professor for a year or two first! Most of the professors were also uneasy about the work of the Mineral Processing Department. For example, Professor Li Yufeng felt that the new mineral processing teaching plan was difficult to implement, so he wanted to return to the mining department. Some professors lacked confidence. For example, Professor Zhong Boqian said after studying the teaching plan and reading several Russian books: "I am old, it won't work, it's too late to study hard again." In response to these ideological situations, we conducted discussions within the department. Through discussions, we first further recognized the significance of mineral processing work in the country's industrialization cause. In this way, everyone was at ease. Secondly, we appropriately assessed our actual situation. In our view, teaching assistants have many advantages and are fully capable of being trained into teachers in a relatively short period of time. First, they are less affected by the old and are more likely to accept the most advanced Soviet scientific achievements; second, they can go out for internships during winter and summer vacations, and the learning efficiency can be greatly improved when theory and practice are closely linked; third, they have no baggage of airs, etc., and can consult everywhere; fourth, they all have a certain basic scientific and technical theoretical foundation and have the conditions for further study. As for professors, they can also learn new things well, because: first, they have already mastered some scientific and technical theories, and they can understand new things as long as they are willing to learn humbly; second, some professors already have certain practical work experience (which is very valuable), and as long as they critically summarize these experiences based on new perspectives, they will be able to better understand new things; third, they have relatively rich teaching experience, which is of great help in compiling textbooks, improving teaching methods, etc. After appropriately assessing our situation, we began teacher training work.
    II.
    How did we carry out this work? First, we studied the sequence and general content of each course in the teaching plan, studied the existing Soviet teaching outlines, and, based on the principles of division of labor and cooperation to ensure that each course has someone to teach, we took care of each teaching assistant's personal wishes and carried out the work of selecting majors. During the preparation process of this work, the professor explained the course content from the side, the department and teaching and research group promptly suggested how to comprehensively take care of the teaching situation, and the teaching assistants discussed with each other to combine each person's wishes with the needs of the work as much as possible. Then the course arrangement was carried out. Regarding this, our principle is "apprenticeship," that is, the course taught by the professor this semester will be the responsibility of the guiding teaching assistant next semester; the professor guarantees to open a new course next semester. For example, the course "Useful Mineral Processing" taught by Professor Zhong Boqian this semester was decided at the beginning of the semester to be assisted by teaching assistants Gao Peizhi and Zhong Xi, and they will be responsible for teaching this course next semester. In order to achieve this goal, we adopted the following methods: First, different chapters of each course are specifically guided by the professor designated by the teaching and research group. First, the teaching and research group helps the teaching assistants to roughly browse all the materials that can be found, write a study outline and formulate a study schedule (in the study outline and study schedule, the chapters are clearly distinguished, and it is noted which books should be carefully referenced in that chapter and section, which pages need to be read in a few days or weeks, and write them into lecture-style reading notes), and then study under the guidance of the professor according to the study outline and study schedule. The learning materials are collected and introduced to each other by the entire department. Everyone performed well in the process of implementing these methods. For example, Professor Li Yufeng spent five Sundays revising the lecture notes for teaching assistant Wu Fubin; Professor Zhong Boqian often talked to teaching assistant Gao Peizhi until late at night; Professor Hu Weibai and teaching assistant Deng Zhisheng jointly read relevant sedimentary theories and sometimes discussed them together in the classroom. Second, systems such as random inspection and "delivery" on schedule were stipulated. For example, the progress of the teaching assistants' advanced studies should be checked at each teaching and research group meeting, experiences should be exchanged, and the teaching and research group should put forward suggestions for improvement. The department's "Next Semester Course Preparation Inspection Team" also continuously cares about and encourages the teaching assistants to write lecture notes or take study notes, and helps them correct errors. Teaching assistant Wu Fubin has now written nearly 70,000 words of lecture notes for the new course "Mineral Processing Plant Lifting and Transportation"; teaching assistant Deng Zhisheng has read a lot of information about the new course "Dehumidification" and made three rich notebooks, which can become quite good lecture notes once sorted out. Third, trial lectures. After the eleventh week of this semester, the teaching assistants who were preparing lessons gave trial lectures. Everyone gave many opinions to the trial lecturers on the content of the teaching materials and teaching methods, and corrected the complacency of the lesson preparers. For example, teaching assistant Wu Fubin overestimated the achievements he had already made. During the trial lecture, he did not bring notes and only considered gestures and language, resulting in drawing the picture wrong; what should have been taught for three hours was finished in less than one hour. The teaching and research office criticized him relatively strictly and helped him overcome his shortcomings. Fourth, internship. We mobilized all the teaching assistants who will be teaching courses next semester to go out for internships as much as possible. Before departing for the internship, the teaching and research group helped each teaching assistant formulate and review their internship plan, explained in detail the tasks and precautions; pointed out which theoretical knowledge in the book should be linked in the internship, and supplemented and revised those parts of the draft lecture notes written by themselves; and also stipulated the outline and diagrams for writing the internship report, etc.
    III.
    Currently, our work has been going on for several months. Over the past few months, we feel that using revolutionary spirit and methods to train teaching assistants is an effective way to overcome the shortage of teachers. Just as the Soviet mining expert Arianmsky once said to us: "We also knew very little in the early days of the revolution, and there was no one to consult at that time. Your situation is completely different today. ... Eighteen years ago, after I graduated from school, I was assigned to the Leningrad Mining Institute, and I was immediately designated to prepare to teach the new course 'Mine Valuation' that I had not learned. I started teaching after studying on my own for half a year under the guidance of a professor. I can now teach 'Mine Valuation' with my eyes closed." Therefore, we firmly believe that the path we are taking is also correct. Although it is difficult for us to train fully qualified teachers in just half a year, adopting this method can change the serious situation of our current lack of teachers.
    The following are some of our experiences in our work:
    First, we believe that doing a good job in the relationship between professors and teaching assistants is a basic condition for doing a good job in teacher training. To do a good job in the relationship, it is necessary to overcome individualistic ideas such as "scholars despise each other" and "self-importance." We have done a good job in this regard.
    Second, we believe that it is necessary to promptly resolve the ideological problems of comrades as the work progresses. For example, teaching assistant Chen Qianwei originally planned to develop in the direction of "electromagnetic mineral processing," but after reading "Electromagnetism" for nearly half a month, he felt that there were many difficulties, and his original ideas changed. Deng Zhisheng and Huang Shu also felt that "dehumidification and dust removal" was more suitable than "mineral processing plant lifting and transportation." At this time, we found everyone to repeatedly discuss, adjusted the courses according to the needs of the work and combined with personal wishes, and encouraged those who lacked confidence. For example, Deng Zhisheng is very humble and hardworking. During the trial lecture, the content and method were as Professor Li Yufeng said, "it is difficult to find fault"; but he is always afraid of going to class, so the teaching and research group encouraged him and helped him eliminate this concern. For example, teaching assistant Gao Peizhi initially agreed to prepare "Useful Mineral Processing" for other departments, but later wanted to specialize in "flotation" and was very afraid that he would only teach "Useful Mineral Processing" forever in the future. We promptly pointed out according to the current actual situation: Today, we certainly hope to become "specialists." Everyone agrees that you want to do more "flotation," and we will also help you achieve this goal; but you cannot limit yourself to a narrow range, so that other courses cannot be taught. It is also wrong to completely disregard the current work needs. In this way, his thinking was clarified.
    Third, we believe that it is also important to carry forward the spirit of fraternity and truly help each other. We have also done a relatively good job in this regard. For example, the "Useful Mineral Processing" teaching and research group not only has to open classes for students in nine classes, but also has to take students to Hunan University to do experiments and is too busy; but in order to enable teaching assistant Wu Fubin to concentrate on advanced studies and lesson preparation, they did not let Wu Fubin tutor and do experiments, but the other three comrades took on all the work. There are three classes of "Mineral Processing Principles," which were originally tutored by three teaching assistants, Huang Shu, Deng Zhisheng, and Chen Qianwei; but in order to give Deng Zhisheng more time to prepare lessons, Huang Shu volunteered to take on more work. This spirit of fraternity and mutual assistance is also a driving force for our progress.

    我们在用革命办法克服师资缺乏的困难
    中南矿冶学院选矿系
    一
    中南矿冶学院选矿系虽然只有教授三人、副教授一人、助教九人，但任务却是要在一年之内，在本系开出“选矿原理”等八门专业课程，并要负担采矿、冶金两系共九个班的“有用矿物精选”一课。总的说来，人力和任务是不相称的。这怎么办呢？“等待上级增派教师吧”，我们确曾有人作过这样的设想，但据了解，东北工学院准备要在采矿系下设一选煤组，也只有一位教授；北京钢铁学院准备在采矿系下设选铁矿组，也只有两位教授（其中一人现已调来我院）。所以“等待上级增派教师”是很困难的。“教授一人教三门课吧”，但面对着陌生的专业教学计划，每个教授又都信心不足；而且学生多，教材要重新写起，一个教授要负责教好一门课程已不容易，教三门课程势必不能保证质量；何况学生一年比一年多，任务也愈来愈大。所以在开学之初的专业设置学习会上，我们便已认识到：师资不足乃是我国目前教育事业中的一大困难，这是发展中的困难。克服这个困难的有效办法之一，就是依靠大家的努力，以互助互学，边教边学的革命精神和办法培养新的师资。这就是让年轻的助教们在自学基础上，由教授指导，能够尽快地担负起教学任务来。
    然而，在当时，实行这种办法的思想障碍还是不少的。助教们被那陌生的专业弄得不安，对开课也没有信心。助教黄枢曾说：“就是学过的课程，毕业后也要跟教授学两年后才能开，现在马上就要开新课，这不是冒险吗？”一般助教则想：还是好好跟教授学习一二年再说吧！教授们也大半不安心于选矿系的工作。如李浴风教授看到新的选矿教学计划觉得不好搞，便要回采矿系去。有的教授信心不足。如钟伯谦教授在研究了教学计划，翻阅了几本俄文书以后说：“我老了，不行啰，再拚命学也来不及。”针对这些思想情况，我们在系内进行了讨论。通过讨论，首先使我们进一步认识了选矿工作在国家工业化事业中的意义。这样，大家都安心了。其次是适当地估计了我们的实际情况。在我们看来，助教是有许多优点的，完全有在较短的时间内被培养成为师资的可能。第一，他们受旧的影响比较少，容易接受最先进的苏联科学成果；第二，寒假、暑假可以出去实习，在理论和实践密切联系的情况下，学习效率一定可以大大提高；第三，没有架子等等的包袱，可以到处请教；第四，都具有一定的基本科学技术理论基础，有进一步学习的条件。至于教授，也同样可以把新东西学好，因为：第一，他们已经掌握了一些科学技术的理论，对新的东西，只要自己肯虚心学习，是可以了解的；第二，有些教授已有一定的实际工作经验（这是非常宝贵的），只要根据新的观点，批判地总结这些经验，就能够更好地理解新的东西；第三，有比较丰富的教学经验，这对于编选教材、改进教学方法等等都有很大的帮助。在适当地估计了我们的情况以后，我们便开始了师资培养工作。
    二
    我们是怎样进行这一工作的呢？首先，我们研究了教学计划中各门课程的先后次序和大概内容，研究了已有的苏联教学大纲，并在分工合作、保证各门课程都有人开的原则下，照顾每个助教个人的志愿，进行了选择专业的工作。在这一工作的酝酿过程中，教授从旁说明课程内容，系和教研组随时提示如何全面地照顾教学情况，由助教互相讨论，使每个人的志愿尽可能和工作需要结合起来。然后就进行课程的安排。关于这，我们的原则是“徒弟出师”，就是这学期由教授开的课，下学期由辅导助教负责；教授保证下学期另开新课。如这学期钟伯谦教授的“有用矿物精选”一课，开学时决定由助教高培枝和钟熹负责辅导，下学期这门课便由他们负责开。为了达到这一目的，我们采用了下列的办法：第一，每门课的不同章节，均由教研组指定教授具体指导。首先由教研组帮助助教们将所有可能找到的资料大略地浏览一遍，写出学习提纲和制订学习进度表（在学习提纲和学习进度表中分清章节，注明该章该节要仔细参考那些书，那几页需要在几天或几周内读完，并写成讲义式的读书笔记），然后根据学习提纲和学习进度表在教授的指导下进行学习。学习的材料由全系共同设法搜集，互相介绍。在实行这些办法的过程当中，大家都表现得很好。如李浴风教授给助教吴夫彬修改讲义，足足花了五个星期天；钟伯谦教授给助教高培枝经常讲到深夜；胡为柏教授同助教邓植生共同阅读有关沉积理论，有时就在教室里共同讨论。第二，规定了随时检查、按期“交货”等制度。如在每次教研组会议上都要检查一下助教们的进修情况，交流经验，并由教研组提出改进意见。系内的“下学期课程准备检查小组”也不断关心和鼓励助教们写讲义或作学习笔记，并帮助他们修正错误。助教吴夫彬现在已经写出了近七万字的“选矿厂提升运输”这一新课程的讲义；助教邓植生阅读了许多有关“去湿”这一新课程的资料，做成了三本内容丰富的笔记，一经整理就可成为相当好的讲义。第三，试讲。在本学期十一周后，备课的助教们进行了试讲。对教材内容，教学方法，大家都给试讲者提出了很多意见，并纠正了备课人的自满情绪。如助教吴夫彬过高地估计了已经取得的成绩，在试讲时不带笔记，只考虑手势和语言，结果把图也画错了；本来应该讲三小时的东西不到一小时就讲完了。教研室就比较严格地批评了他，帮助他克服缺点。第四，实习。我们尽可能地动员了所有下学期开课的助教出去实习。在出发实习前，教研组帮助每个助教制订并审查了他们的实习计划，详细地交代了任务和应注意事项；指出在实习中要联系书本上的那些理论知识，补充并修正自己所写讲义草稿的那些部分；还规定了作实习报告的大纲和图样等。
    三
    目前，我们的工作已进行有几个月了。几个月来，我们觉得：用革命的精神和办法培养助教，是克服师资缺乏的一个有效办法。正如苏联采矿专家阿良姆斯基曾经对我们说过的：“我们在革命胜利初期，也是懂得很少，当时也没有人可以请教，今天你们的情况是完全不同了。……十八年以前我从学校毕业出来，便被分配到列宁格勒矿冶学院，当时就指定我准备教我未学过的‘矿山估价’这门新课程，我在教授指导下自学半年就开课了。我现在可以闭着眼教‘矿山估价’了。”因此我们深信我们所走的这一道路也是正确的。虽然只用半年时间，我们还很难培养出完全合乎标准的师资，但采用这种办法，是能够改变我们当前缺乏师资的这种严重的状况的。
    以下，是我们在工作中的一点体会：
    第一、我们认为，搞好教授和助教们的关系，是作好培养师资工作的基本条件。要搞好关系，就必须克服“文人相轻”、“自命不凡”等等的个人主义思想。在这一点上，我们作得还好。
    第二、我们认为，必须随着工作的进行，及时地解决同志们的思想问题。如助教陈前亹原来计划向“电磁选矿”方向发展，但看了近半个月“电磁学”，觉得困难很多，原来的想法发生了变化。邓植生、黄枢也觉得搞“选矿厂提升运输”不如“去湿除尘”合适。这时我们就找大家一起反复商谈，按照工作的需要，结合个人志愿把课程加以调整，对于信心不足的就加以鼓励。如邓植生很虚心，也很努力，在试讲时，内容、方法都如李浴风教授所说的，“很难找出毛病”；但他总怕上课，于是教研组就鼓励他，帮助他扫除这种顾虑。又如助教高培枝起初答应准备外系的“有用矿物精选”，但后来又想专搞“浮选”，很怕将来永远只教“有用矿物精选”。我们就根据目前的实际情况及时指出：今天，我们当然希望自己成为“专才”，你想多搞一些“浮选”，大家是赞成的，同时也会帮助你达到目的的；但你也不能限制在一个狭窄的范围里，以致使其他课程都不能教。至于完全无视当前的工作需要，也是不对的。这样，就把他的思想搞通了。
    第三、我们认为，发扬友爱精神，真正作到互相帮助也是重要的。这一点我们也作得比较好。如“有用矿物精选”教研组除了要为九个班的同学开课，还要带同学到湖南大学做实验，忙不过来；但为了使助教吴夫彬能专心进修备课，他们就不让吴夫彬去辅导和做实验，而由其他三个同志把全部工作担当下来。有三个班的“选矿原理”，本来是由黄枢、邓植生和陈前亹三位助教共同辅导的；但为了使邓植生有更多的时间备课，黄枢自愿多承担一些工作。这种友爱精神和互相帮助的作法，也正是推动我们前进的一种力量。
