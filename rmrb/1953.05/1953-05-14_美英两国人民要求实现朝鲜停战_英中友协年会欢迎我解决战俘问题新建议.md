Xinhua News Agency, May 13th dispatch: According to TASS, New York, May 12th dispatch: The Executive Committee of the United Packinghouse Workers of America, representing 150,000 members, has issued an appeal to other labor unions in the United States, calling on them to participate in a movement to strive for an end to the Korean War, recognize the legitimate government of People's China, agree to its representatives joining the United Nations, and peacefully resolve all Far Eastern issues.
    The organ of one of the union's branches, "The Union Member," warned American workers to be wary of the attempt by a small number of people who are making huge profits from the war to destroy the opportunity to establish universal peace.
    Among American farmers, the sentiment advocating for an end to the Korean War is also rising. "The Farmer and Iowa Homestead" magazine conducted a poll among Iowa farmers in February regarding the best way to solve the Korean issue. The results of the poll showed that 65 percent of the farmers either advocated for reaching an armistice or for withdrawing American troops from Korea. The magazine said that if the poll were conducted at a time when people were even more eager to end the Korean War, then more people would favor an armistice.
    Tens of thousands of ordinary Americans are writing letters to newspapers, demanding that peace be established in Korea as soon as possible, and that all disputed issues be resolved through peaceful negotiations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 13th dispatch: London's "Daily Worker" reported that the Sino-British Friendship Association held its annual meeting in London on May 10th. The meeting welcomed the new proposal put forward by Korea and China to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue, believing that it was a way to break the deadlock in the armistice negotiations. The meeting demanded that the British government accept the proposal put forward by Korea and China for a five-nation commission to manage prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. The meeting also demanded that the British government insist that the People's Republic of China obtain its due position on the United Nations Security Council.
    The meeting condemned the government's policy of restricting Anglo-Chinese trade by refusing to issue licenses and prohibiting ships bound for China from obtaining coaling facilities. The meeting demanded that the government abolish all trade bans and restrictions.
    Jim Busfield Feagins expressed his opinions when discussing the British and Far Eastern problems. He emphasized that the British labor and trade union movement could play a huge role in the struggle for peace. He said: "It is completely incorrect to think that peace can be sought through military strength." He said: "The people of Asia have awakened. They are demanding national independence, and they are also fighting for national independence. We cannot interfere with this historical fact."
    The National Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, representing 900,000 British machine workers, held a meeting in Eastbourne on May 8th. The meeting unanimously demanded an immediate armistice in Korea. Jay Tanner, chairman of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, said that this resolution undoubtedly represented the opinions of all members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. It also represents the opinions of all workers in Britain and around the world.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 13th dispatch: According to TASS, London, May 12th dispatch: London's "Daily Worker" reported that the Electrical Trades Union conference opened in Clacton (Essex) on May 11th.
    Frank Foulkes, president of the Electrical Trades Union, introduced the three Chinese guests attending the meeting in his opening speech. Everyone in the hall stood up and expressed the warmest welcome to the three guests. Then, Foulkes said that the trade union movement has a responsibility to promote the continuous continuation of the Korean armistice negotiations. This remark once again aroused warm applause.
    Foulkes continued, saying that the labor movement should clearly state that they will never allow themselves to be dragged into war. The people of any country have the right to decide their own way of life without interference from the outside. Foulkes strongly opposed Britain being in the position of America's "poor neighbor." He firmly demanded the restoration of British sovereignty. He emphasized that free trade with all countries is extremely important for Britain's survival.

    美英两国人民要求实现朝鲜停战
    英中友协年会欢迎我解决战俘问题新建议
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约十二日讯：美国联合屠宰工人工会执行委员会代表十五万会员向美国其他工会发出一项呼吁，要求它们参加争取停止朝鲜战争、承认人民中国的合法政府并同意它的代表加入联合国、以及和平解决一切远东问题的运动。
    这个工会的一个分会的机关刊物“工会会员”向美国工人提出警告，要他们提防一小撮靠战争赚取巨额利润的人们想毁灭建立普遍和平的机会的企图。
    在美国农民中间，主张结束朝鲜战争的情绪也在日益高涨。“农民和衣阿华家庭”杂志在二月间就解决朝鲜问题的最好办法在衣阿华州农民间进行了一次民意测验。测验的结果是：百分之六十五的农民不是主张达成停战，就是主张把美国军队撤出朝鲜。这个杂志说：如果测验是在目前人民更加希望结束朝鲜战争的时候进行，那么将有更多人赞成停战。
    成千上万的美国老百姓正在写信给报纸，要求尽早建立朝鲜的和平，并通过和平谈判解决一切争执中的问题。
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】伦敦“工人日报”报道说：英中友好协会五月十日在伦敦举行年会。会上欢迎朝鲜和中国提出的解决战俘问题的新建议，认为这是打破停战谈判僵局的办法。会议要求英国政府接受朝中两国提出的由五国委员会管理不直接遣返的战俘的建议。会议并要求英国政府坚持让中华人民共和国获得它在联合国安全理事会中的应有的地位。
    会议斥责政府以拒绝发给许可证，和禁止给开往中国的船只以加煤便利的方法来限制英中贸易的政策，会议要求政府取消一切贸易禁令与限制。
    吉姆·布·费金斯在讨论英国与远东问题时发表意见，他强调英国的劳工与工会运动能够在争取和平的斗争中起巨大的作用。他说：有人认为可以凭着军备力量谋求和平，这种意见完全不正确。他说：“亚洲的人民已经觉醒了。他们正在要求民族独立，并且也正在为民族独立而斗争。我们不能干涉这个历史事实。”
    代表九十万英国机器工人的混合机器工会全国委员会于五月八日在东培恩举行会议，会上一致要求立即在朝鲜实现停战。混合机器工会主席杰·唐纳说：这个决议毫无疑问地表示了混合机器工会全体会员的意见。它也表示了英国和全世界一切工人的意见。
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：伦敦“工人日报”报道说，电气工会会议于五月十一日在克莱克顿（埃赛克斯郡）开幕。
    电气工会主席弗兰克·福尔克斯在致开幕词时介绍了参加会议的三位中国来宾。会场里的人全体起立，对这三位来宾表示最热烈的欢迎。接着，福尔克斯说，工会运动有责任促使朝鲜停战谈判继续不断。这段话又一次引起了热烈的掌声。
    福尔克斯继续说，工人运动应该明白表示：他们决不允许被拖进战争里去。任何国家的人民都有不受从外面来的干涉而决定他们自己的生活方式的权利。福尔克斯强烈反对英国处于美国“可怜的邻邦”的地位。他坚决要求恢复英国的主权。他强调说，和一切国家自由贸易对于英国的生存来说是极其重要的。
