To Improve the Scientific and Technical Level of On-the-Job Cadres in Industrial and Mining Enterprises
	Industrial Cadre Part-Time Schools Established in Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin

At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin successively established three part-time schools aimed at improving the scientific and technical level of on-the-job cadres in industrial and mining enterprises and cultivating management and technical talents for industry and mining.

The Industrial and Mining Cadre Part-Time University, experimentally run at the Northeast Institute of Technology, opened on January 19th. The 292 students of the school come from 47 factories and mines and industrial leading organs in Shenyang City. Among them are 4 bureau directors and deputy directors, 32 division-level cadres, 37 factory directors, and the remaining students are leading cadres above section chief and Party and mass work cadres in various units. Many of these students are cadres who have participated in the revolution for a long time and have rarely had the opportunity to formally study culture in the past, and their cultural levels vary. Some people originally only attended elementary school, and although their language proficiency has improved through work, their mathematics, physics, and chemistry proficiency is relatively low; others graduated from high school, but because they have been out of school for many years, most of what they learned has been forgotten and needs to be relearned. Based on these situations, the part-time university is currently running preparatory courses first, and the study time is tentatively set for one to two years, using accelerated teaching methods to enable students to complete middle school mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other courses before entering undergraduate studies. Currently, the school is temporarily divided into three high school classes and three junior high school classes, and a senior elementary school class is specially set up for cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds. Classes are held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening, for a total of nine hours of study. To solve the problem of short revision time for on-the-job cadres, the method of classroom lectures and classroom revision is adopted. In order to clarify the students' actual cultural level, the school had the students review for three weeks, and then determined the classes through exams and adjustments. After the official start of classes on March 2nd, the students' enthusiasm for learning is very high. Even with the relatively large changes in the institutions of various units, an attendance rate of about 80% has been maintained. Some students have to take a car to Beijing to attend meetings at 9:00 p.m., but before getting on the car, they still seize the time to go to school to attend classes; some students, after being delayed in their studies due to official business, squeeze out time to do exercises and hand them in to the teachers for correction; others have signed contracts with technicians in their units and actively ask them to tutor them. They have expressed their determination to persevere in their studies and improve their scientific and technical knowledge so as to meet the needs of the motherland's large-scale economic construction.

The Industrial and Mining Cadre Part-Time University of the Northeast Institute of Technology is led by an education committee composed of the Education Bureau, Personnel Bureau, Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and several major industrial administration bureaus of the Northeast Administrative Committee. The principal is Comrade Wang Zhili, Vice President of the Northeast Institute of Technology. The school has three full-time cadres, and the teachers are mainly兼任 by teachers from the Northeast Institute of Technology.

The Dalian City Cadre Industrial School opened as early as November 11, 1952. The 136 students of the school are also mostly factory directors, Party branch secretaries, and leading cadres of various departments of the Dalian Municipal Committee from state-owned factories and mines in Dalian. Comrade Chen Bocun, Second Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Zhang Zhiyuan, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, also participated in the study. Currently, they are divided into three classes to study mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses; classes are held twice a week, each time for five hours. The principal of the school is Comrade Chen Bocun, and the vice principals are Comrade Zhang Zhiyuan and Comrade Qu Bochuan, President of the Dalian Institute of Technology.

The Harbin Part-Time Industrial University opened on January 15th of this year. The 228 students of the school are also leading cadres with a junior high school education or above in local state-owned factories and related agencies in Harbin City. They are divided into four classes, with classes held four times a week, and the teachers are兼任 by teachers from the Harbin Institute of Technology; in addition, there are three full-time cadres responsible for handling daily work. The school plans to recruit another group of industrial and mining cadres into the school after the summer vacation.

### 提高工矿企业在职干部的科学技术水平  沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨设立工业干部业余学校

    提高工矿企业在职干部的科学技术水平
    沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨设立工业干部业余学校
    去年年底和今年年初，沈阳、旅大和哈尔滨三市先后设立了三所以提高工矿企业在职干部的科学技术水平、培养工矿的管理人才及技术人才为目的的业余学校。
    在东北工学院试办的工矿干部业余大学已在一月十九日开学。该校的二百九十二名学生系来自沈阳市的四十七个厂矿和工业领导机关，其中有正副局长四人、处长级干部三十二人、厂长三十七人，其余学员则都是各单位科长以上和党群工作的领导干部。这些学员很多都是参加革命较久的干部，过去很少有机会正规地学习文化，而且文化程度也参差不齐。有的人原来只读过高小，语文程度虽在工作的锻炼中有了提高，但数理化程度却比较低；有的虽曾在高中毕业，但因已离校多年，所学也已大半忘记，需要从新学起。根据这些情况，业余大学目前先办预科，学习时间暂定一年到两年，以速成教学的方法，使学员学完中学数学、物理、化学等课程后，再升入本科，学习大学课程。目前学校暂分高中班和初中班各三个班，并特为工农出身的干部设一个高小班。每周星期一、三、五晚间上课，共学习九小时。为了解决在职干部复习时间少的问题，采取课堂讲授、课堂复习的办法。为了弄清学员的实际文化水平，学校曾使学员进行了三个星期的复习，然后又经过考试、调整而确定了班级。三月二日正式开课之后，学员们的学习积极性很高，在目前各单位机构变动比较大的情况下，一直保持了百分之八十左右的出席率。有的学员，晚上九点钟须乘车到北京去开会，而临上车前，还抓紧时间到学校去听课；有的学员，因公耽误课业后，就挤出时间补做习题，交给教员批改；也有的学员和本单位的技术人员订了合同，主动地找他们给自己补课。他们纷纷表示决心，一定要坚持学到底，提高自己的科学技术知识水平，以适应祖国大规模经济建设的需要。
    东北工学院的工矿干部业余大学是由东北行政委员会教育局、人事局、中共沈阳市委宣传部和几个主要的工业管理局组成的教育委员会来领导的。校长是东北工学院副院长汪之力同志。学校有三名专职干部，教员基本上是由东北工学院教师兼任。
    旅大市的干部工业学校早在一九五二年十一月十一日就开学了。该校的一百三十六名学员也大都是旅大市国营厂矿的厂长、党总支书记和市委各部的领导干部。中共旅大市委第二书记陈伯村同志和宣传部副部长张知远同志也都参加了学习。目前，他们分做三班学习数学、物理、化学课程；每周上课两次，每次学习五小时。该校校长是陈伯村同志，副校长是张知远同志和大连工学院院长屈伯川同志。
    哈尔滨业余工业大学是在今年一月十五日开学的。该校的二百二十八名学员也都是哈尔滨市地方国营工厂和有关机关中具有初中以上文化程度的领导干部。他们分做四班上课，每周上课四次，由哈尔滨工业大学教员兼课；另有三名专职干部负责处理日常工作。该校拟于暑假后再吸收一批工矿干部入校学习。
