Xinhua News Agency, London, May 27th: TASS London, May 26th: Passant, Secretary-General of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on the Austrian Treaty, sent a letter to the Soviet Foreign Minister's Assistant for the Austrian Treaty at the Soviet Embassy in the United Kingdom on May 11th of this year. In this letter, Passant stated that the British representative had suggested convening a meeting of the four countries—the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on the Austrian Treaty on May 27th, and requested notification as to whether the above date was acceptable.

Passant also stated in his letter that he had sent letters with the same content to the American and French representatives.

Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ya. A. Malik, replied to Passant on May 25th as follows:

“I have received your letter of May 11th, which suggests convening a meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants in London on May 27th to draft a treaty draft on Austria. I deem it necessary to draw your attention to the following facts.

“Firstly, it is necessary to recall that the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on the Austrian Treaty is not a permanent four-power body. The right to convene this meeting rests with the Council of Foreign Ministers, which was decided upon by the Potsdam Conference in 1945.

“The issue of the Austrian treaty has been repeatedly discussed in the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference since 1947, but despite the efforts of the Soviet side, no agreement has been reached. From 1947 to 1949, the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference was convened many times, but these meetings did not produce the desired results. The Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference convened in 1950 likewise did not lead to a resolution of the Austrian treaty issue. At the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference convened in February 1953, the situation was not changed due to the attitude adopted by the representatives of the three countries.

“Under these circumstances, there is no reason to expect that the now-proposed meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Assistants will produce better results than previous meetings.

“For the above reasons, I believe it would be more appropriate to consider and study this issue through mutual exchange of views through diplomatic channels.”

    苏联驻英大使马立克致函帕桑特
    答复关于召开对奥和约外长助理会议问题
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：对奥和约四国外长助理会议秘书长帕桑特，曾于今年五月十一日把致苏联对奥和约外长助理的一封信送交苏联驻英国大使馆。帕桑特在这封信中说，英国代表曾建议在五月二十七日召开四国——苏联、美国、英国和法国——对奥和约外长助理会议，并要求通知他上述日期是否可以接受。
    帕桑特在他的信中还说，他已把具有同样内容的信送交美国和法国代表。
    苏联驻英国大使雅·亚·马立克在五月二十五日给帕桑特复信如下：
    “我已经收到你五月十一日的信，信中建议五月二十七日在伦敦召开四国外长助理会议以草拟对奥和约草案，我认为有必要提请你注意下列事实。
    “首先，需要追忆一下，对奥和约外长助理会议不是一个常设的四国机构，这个会议的召集权在外长会议，外长会议是一九四五年的波茨坦会议决定成立的。
    “对奥和约的问题自从一九四七年以来，曾一再地在外长助理会议中讨论，但是，尽管有苏联方面的努力，却始终没有达成协议。从一九四七年至一九四九年间，曾多次召开外长助理会议，但是这些会议并没有产生应有的结果。在一九五○年召开的外长助理会议同样地没有导向解决对奥和约问题。在一九五三年二月间召开的外长助理会议上，由于三国代表所采取的态度，也没有使情况有所改变。
    “在这种情况下，没有理由可以期望现在建议召开的外长助理会议将会产生比以前的会议更良好的结果。
    “根据上述理由，我认为通过外交途径互相交换意见来考虑研究一下这个问题，将会比较得当。”
