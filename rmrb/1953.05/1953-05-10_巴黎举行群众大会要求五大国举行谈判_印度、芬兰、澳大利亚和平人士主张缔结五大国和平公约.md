Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 7th. TASS reported from Paris on the 7th: The Peace Councils of the 5th, 6th, and 7th districts of Paris held a mass rally on the 5th at the Mutualité under the slogan "Negotiate for Peace."

    Pierre Bauman, a member of the French National Peace Council, spoke at the rally. He pointed out that the French government had not yet responded to the letter from the International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of the Peoples for Peace to the governments of the five major powers, urging them to hold negotiations to conclude a peace pact. He reminded the audience that the International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of the Peoples for Peace had received affirmative responses from the governments of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Romania, and other countries.

    The famous French writer Jean-Paul Sartre spoke at the rally. He said that negotiations must be held with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to end this "absurd, dangerous, and unjust war that is dragging France onto the path of American policy."

    Sartre said: "We are forcing our people to sacrifice their lives meaninglessly. In Europe, we are pursuing absurd and disastrous policies. Because of this policy, friends of peace are imprisoned, and propaganda defaming the Soviet Union can be carried out freely. However, it is still possible to end the Indochina war and refuse to participate in the European army. By doing so, we can strive for peace."

    Jean-Paul Sartre urged the audience to launch a broad movement to urge the French government to give an affirmative response to the proposals of the World Congress of the Peoples for Peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 6th. TASS reported from Delhi on the 6th: The Gujarat Provincial Peace Conference held in Ahmedabad, India, has concluded. The conference passed a resolution unanimously demanding an immediate cessation of military actions in Malaya and Indochina, an end to the repression of Tunisia by the French authorities, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territories of Asia and Africa. The conference emphasized that imperialists are attempting to suppress the national liberation movements in Africa, Asia, and South America. In order to safeguard world peace, the conference called for the abolition of foreign rule and the abolition of military pacts such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the planned Middle East military pact. The conference also passed a resolution advocating the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.
    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 6th. TASS reported from Helsinki on the 6th: Finland will launch a week of peace movement activities from May 10th to 17th. The leadership of the Finnish Peace Supporters Organization has issued an appeal calling on all peace-loving citizens, regardless of political views or worldviews, to unite in the struggle to defend peace and oppose the threat of another war.

    The appeal pointed out that the conclusion of a five-power peace pact is also in Finland's interests. It can reduce the danger of another world war and create broader opportunities for economic prosperity and cultural progress.
    Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 8th. According to a report in the Sydney "Tribune": The New South Wales Peace Committee of Australia recently passed a resolution welcoming the resumption of armistice talks in Korea. The resolution called for an immediate ceasefire in Korea and supported the proposal for a five-power peace pact. The New South Wales Peace Committee decided to convene a New South Wales Peace Supporters Conference in June.

    巴黎举行群众大会要求五大国举行谈判
    印度、芬兰、澳大利亚和平人士主张缔结五大国和平公约
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社巴黎七日讯：巴黎第五、第六和第七区的和平理事会在“必须谈判以便求得和平”的口号下，于五日在团结宫召开了一次群众大会。
    法国全国和平理事会理事皮尔·巴曼特尔在大会上演说。他指出：法国政府到现在还没有答复世界人民和平大会国际委员会敦促五大国进行谈判以便缔结和平公约的致五大国政府书。他提醒听众说：世界人民和平大会国际委员会已经得到苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚和其他国家政府肯定的答复。
    法国名作家让·保罗·萨特在大会上讲话。他说，必须和越南民主共和国政府进行谈判，来结束这个“荒唐、危险和非正义的，而且把法国拖上美国政策的轨道的战争”。
    萨特说：“我们正在强迫我们的人民毫无意义地牺牲他们的性命。我们在欧洲正在奉行着荒谬的和制造灾难的政策。由于这个政策，和平的友人被监禁，诽谤苏联的宣传可以随便进行。但是，现在结束印度支那战争和拒绝参加欧洲军仍然是可能的。这样做，就可以争取到和平。”
    让·保罗·萨特敦促听众发动一个广泛的运动，来促使法国政府给世界人民和平大会的建议一个肯定的答复。
   【新华社八日讯】塔斯社德里六日讯：在印度阿麦达巴举行的古吉莱特省和平大会结束了。大会通过决议，一致要求立刻停止在马来亚和印度支那的军事行动，停止法国当局对突尼斯的镇压，以及一切外国军队撤出亚洲和非洲的领土。大会强调指出：帝国主义者企图镇压非洲、亚洲和南美洲的民族解放运动。为了维护全世界的和平，大会要求取消外国的统治，取消北大西洋公约和计划中的中东军事公约之类的军事公约。大会并通过决议，主张缔结五大国和平公约。
   【新华社七日讯】塔斯社赫尔辛基六日讯：从五月十日到十七日，芬兰将要展开一次和平运动周活动。芬兰和平拥护者组织的领导机构为此发出一项呼吁，号召一切爱好和平的公民，不分政治见解和世界观，团结起来进行保卫和平、反对另一次战争威胁的斗争。
    呼吁书指出：缔结五大国和平公约也是符合芬兰的利益的。它可以减少另一次世界战争的危险，并且为经济繁荣与文化进步创造更广泛的机会。
   【新华社八日讯】据悉尼“论坛报”报道：澳大利亚新南威尔士和平委员会最近通过欢迎朝鲜停战谈判恢复的决议。决议要求立即在朝鲜停火，并拥护五大国缔结和平公约的建议。新南威尔士和平委员会决定在六月间召开新南威尔士和平拥护者大会。
