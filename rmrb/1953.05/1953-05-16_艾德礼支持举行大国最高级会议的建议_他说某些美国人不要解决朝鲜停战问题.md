Xinhua News Agency, London, May 14th: TASS reports from London on May 14th that Attlee, speaking during a foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons on May 12th, advocated closer personal relations between the major powers. He made this speech in response to Prime Minister Churchill's speech on May 11th, in which Churchill advocated negotiations between the four major powers "without further delay."

Attlee said that what was really needed was for Britain to understand the Soviet Union better, and for the Soviet Union to understand Britain better.

Attlee believed that nationalist movements everywhere should be considered, whether these movements were occurring in Indochina, Egypt, Arabia, or Africa. He said: "It is indeed an oversimplification to describe all this as a Soviet conspiracy." Attlee said that there happened to be some people in the United States and Britain who advocated such a view. On the other hand, whether in Britain or elsewhere, there were others who believed that these disturbances were all caused by American policies. "I think this view is also wrong."

Attlee echoed the Prime Minister's opinion that the resolution of individual issues should not be underestimated or abandoned. There was a great danger of setting goals that were too broad, hoping to solve everything at once. "I think that if there are so many logs in the river that they cannot move, to get this large pile of logs moving, one should start by picking up only one or two logs."

Attlee went on to say that he was willing to talk about certain facts about the United States, hoping that this would not cause unpleasantness. He was willing to talk about some comparisons first. He said: "The Prime Minister has come to the House of Commons and explained his policies. If he wished, he could put it to a vote and receive everyone's support, or, as in this debate, receive a great deal of support from both sides.

"But look at the other side. President Eisenhower has delivered a lengthy speech. He speaks on behalf of the government, but in the United States, power is divided equally between the government and Congress. The government may wish to encourage our exports to the United States, but in the case of the Dalles Dam, the British company's bid, although the lowest, was rejected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the government's policy may not be implemented in such matters.

The American government is not the real master of itself. Congress is still composed of people who mainly represent the interests of a certain state in the country."

Attlee continued, one of the many facts in the world situation is that the U.S. Constitution was drawn up for an isolationist country, and Americans are unwilling to have any dealings with Europe. "I am not criticizing the United States or its Constitution; I am merely stating facts, because I think people often misunderstand these facts. Because we do not understand the U.S. Constitution, there are misunderstandings and disappointments. People often can't figure out who has more power, President Eisenhower or Senator McCarthy."

Speaking of the Korean armistice negotiations, Attlee said: "We should also face the fact that some people in the United States do not want to resolve this armistice issue. Some advocate all-out war with China and a general war against communism; in addition, the forces outside Congress that support Chiang Kai-shek are also very powerful."

Attlee pointed out that it would be beneficial if other relevant United Nations member states participated in the Korean armistice negotiations. He said: "I am convinced that after we all hope that the ongoing armistice negotiations will end, further solutions should not be left entirely to the United States."

Attlee also said that he had recently felt uneasy about the slow progress of the negotiations. "I don't think that these other things that are currently in question are really what is causing the negotiations to stall." "I am now more convinced than ever that once an agreement is reached, China should obtain its rightful place on the Security Council. It seems that China is indeed developing into a very capable country. It deserves to be one of the five major powers."

Attlee continued, China's peace is of vital interest to Britain. Its hopes of increasing trade with the United States have been greatly reduced due to recent events. It seems that the phrase "trade, not aid" does not seem to have been accepted by the United States. "We are often strongly urged not to trade with China, even trade in goods that have little to do with the forces of war. Like others, the resolution of this China issue is of vital interest to us."

Attlee continued: He firmly believes that any attempt to make the Indochina issue a United Nations issue would cause "major divisions within the United Nations, and even more seriously for us, would even cause divisions within the Commonwealth."

He said that he had recently (when attending the Asian Socialist Conference in Burma) met many people from Asian countries. Attlee said that whether rightly or wrongly, they believed that the Viet Minh was ultimately a rebellion primarily against French colonialism. Naturally, the Viet Minh accepted support from the Chinese or anyone else, just as China accepted Russian help. "But to imagine that the Indochinese are willing to be a vassal state of China is contrary to the entire history of that region of the world."

Attlee believed that France "is slow to recognize this nationalist movement. I don't blame the French, because after all, they were defeated in the war. In restoring their position, perhaps also in understanding the new forces of Asia, their work is very difficult." Attlee continued, but he couldn't help but recall that there was a time when this matter could have been resolved. "Today, Ho Chi Minh could have been the Prime Minister in a part of French Indochina, just as some people who used to disagree with us are now Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth. I think it is important that they should accept the logic of events."

Attlee said that it would be wrong to suggest that a unified Germany should automatically become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "I think Russia must oppose this, just as we would oppose if someone suggested that West Germany should become a vassal state of the Russian Empire."

Attlee finally expressed his support for the Prime Minister's proposal to convene a great power summit. "I agree with the Prime Minister that it is inappropriate to suggest a conference attended by many experts and entourages."

Attlee said that he firmly believed that any public discussion would be a mistake. The situation in the United Nations shows this. Any such conference would require thorough preparation. "We want to make clear what we are asking for, and this applies not only to our own country, but also to the United States."

Attlee continued, here again there is a very special constitutional issue. "It is possible for President Eisenhower to return to the United States after attending such a conference and be overthrown, as was the case with President Wilson after attending the Versailles Conference." Therefore, it is important that whoever attends the conference should have full authority. Full cooperation is needed in seeking these ideals, but it would be unwise to hope that such a conference would suddenly eliminate all international differences. The main value of the conference lies in establishing personal contact and understanding, and then building a subsequent peace on this basis.

### 艾德礼支持举行大国最高级会议的建议  他说某些美国人不要解决朝鲜停战问题

    艾德礼支持举行大国最高级会议的建议
    他说某些美国人不要解决朝鲜停战问题
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社伦敦十四日讯：据路透社消息，艾德礼于五月十二日在下院辩论外交问题时发言，主张大国之间建立较密切的个人关系。他发表这个演说，是为了答复邱吉尔首相五月十一日的演说，邱吉尔在那篇演说里主张四大国举行谈判，“而不要再多所迟延”。
    艾德礼说，真正需要的，是英国更加了解苏联，苏联更加了解英国。
    艾德礼认为，应该考虑各地的民族主义运动，不论这些运动是发生在印度支那、埃及、阿拉伯还是非洲。他说：“如果把这一切说成是苏联的阴谋，那就的确把问题看得太简单了。”艾德礼说，在美国和英国，偏偏有一部分人主张这样的看法。而另一方面，无论在英国或任何其他地方，也有另一些人认为这一些纷扰都是由美国的政策所促成的。“我以为，这种看法也是错误的。”
    艾德礼附和首相的意见说，不应该小看或者放弃个别问题的解决。有一种很大的危险就是把目标定得太广泛，希望一下子解决。“我以为，假如河里的木头多到挤不动的时候，要想这一大堆木头能够流动，开头只应该捞起一根或者一两根木头。”
    艾德礼接着说，他愿意谈一谈某些关于美国的事实，希望这不至于引起不愉快。他愿先谈一些对比。他说：“首相莅临下院，并说明了他的政策。假如他希望的话，他可以提付表决，得到大家的拥护，或者如这次辩论中一样，还得到双方面很大程度的支持。
    “但看一看另外一方面。艾森豪威尔总统发表了一篇长篇的演说。他代表政府讲话，但是在美国，权力是由政府和国会平分的。政府也许是愿望鼓励我们对美国的出口的，但是在大约瑟夫水坝这件事上，英国公司的投标虽然最低，却也被美国陆军方面拒绝了，在这一类事情上政府的政策也会不能贯彻的。
    美国政府不是它自己的真正主宰。国会也还是由主要代表国内某一州的利益的人组成的。”
    艾德礼继续说，世界局势中的许多事实之一是：美国的宪法是为一个孤立主义国家制订的、美国人并不愿意与欧洲有任何来往。“我绝不是在批评美国或它的宪法，我只不过是在说明事实，因为我认为人们常常误解了这些事实。因为我们不了解美国的宪法，因此存在着误会和失望。人们常常弄不清楚艾森豪威尔总统和参议员麦克锡两个人究竟是谁的权力大。”
    讲到朝鲜的停战谈判，艾德礼说：“美国有些人不要解决这停战问题，我们也应该正视这个事实。有人主张与中国进行全面战争，普遍地与共产主义作战；此外，国会外面支持蒋介石的一派人的势力也很强大。”
    艾德礼指出，如果有其他有关的联合国会员国参加朝鲜停战谈判，那将是有益的。他说：“我深信，当我们大家希望正在举行的停战谈判结束以后，进一步的解决不应该完全交由美国去进行。”
    艾德礼又说，他最近对谈判迟缓不前感到不安。“我不认为目前成为问题的这另一些事情，真正是使谈判停滞不前的事情。” “我目前比以前更确信，一俟达成协议，中国应在安全理事会内取得它应得的地位。看来中国的确是在发展为一个很有能力的国家。它理应成为五大国之一。”
    艾德礼继续说，中国的和平对英国有切身的利害关系。它所抱的与美国增加贸易的希望，由于最近的事态而大大地减少了。看起来，“要贸易而不要援助”这句话似乎并没有被美国所接受。“我们常常被极力要求，不要与中国进行贸易，甚至那些与战争力量很少关系的货物的贸易。像对别人一样，这个中国事件的解决，对我们是有切身利害关系的。”
    艾德礼继续说：他坚信，想使印度支那事件成为联合国问题的任何企图，一定会引起“联合国内部的重大分裂，对我们更为严重的是，甚至会引起联邦内部的分裂。”
    他说，他不久以前（到缅甸出席亚洲社会党会议时）曾遇到许多从亚洲国家来的人。艾德礼说，不论是对还是不对，他们都认为：越盟归根到底主要是反对法国殖民主义的叛乱。自然，越盟接受了中国人或其他任何人方面的支持，正如中国接受俄国的帮助一样。“但是如果设想印度支那人愿意作为中国的附庸国，那是违反世界那个地区的全部历史的。”
    艾德礼认为：法国“迟迟不承认这个民族主义行动。我并不怪法国人，因为毕竟说来，他们是在战争中打败了。在恢复他们的地位方面，也许还有在了解亚洲的新生的力量方面，他们的工作是很困难的。”艾德礼继续说，但是他不禁想起，有一个时候，这件事本来有可能得到解决。“今天胡志明本来可以在法属印度支那的一部分地方当总理，正如有一些过去与我们意见不同的人现在当英联邦的总理一样。我认为，重要的是：他们应当接受事态演变的逻辑。”
    艾德礼说，如果建议一个统一的德国应当自动地成为北大西洋条约组织的一部分，那会是错误的。“我认为俄国一定要反对这一点，正如像如果有人建议西德应当成为俄罗斯帝国的一个附庸国的话，我们也一定会反对一样。”
    艾德礼最后表示支持首相召开大国最高级会议的建议。“我同意首相的看法，即建议召开一个有许多专家、随员参加的会议是不适宜的。”
    艾德礼说，他深信任何事情公开讨论都会是一个错误。联合国的情形可以看出这一点。任何这样的会议都需要周密的准备。“我们希望弄清楚我们要求的是什么，而且这不仅适用于本国，也适用于美国。”
    艾德礼继续说，这里又有着一个非常特殊的宪法问题。“对艾森豪威尔总统来说，有可能在出席这样一次会议后回到美国后又被推翻，像威尔逊总统参加凡尔赛会议后的情况一样。”因此，重要的是，不管谁参加会议，都应该具有充分的权力。在寻求这些理想时，需要充分的合作，但是如果希望这样一次会议会骤然清除一切国际纷歧，那是不明智的。会议的主要价值在于建立个人间的接触与谅解，然后再在这一基础上建立随后到来的和平。
