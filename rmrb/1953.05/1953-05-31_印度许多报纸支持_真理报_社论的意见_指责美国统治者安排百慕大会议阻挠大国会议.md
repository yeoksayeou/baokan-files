Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 30th: Major Indian newspapers on May 25th all published summaries of the "Pravda" editorial "On the Current International Situation" on their news pages. Many newspapers also published editorials expressing agreement with "Pravda's" opinion that the Bermuda conference without the participation of the Soviet Union would not ease international tensions, but would instead worsen them. These editorials emphasized that if a big power conference were to be held, there should be no pre-planned conditions or policies. The conference should be held in an atmosphere of openness and frankness, without any preconditions.

The Urdu newspaper "New Century" published a commentary stating that the "Pravda" editorial demonstrated how sincere the Soviet Union's desire for world peace and peaceful negotiations was. The commentary pointed out: "The United States is attempting to use this Bermuda conference to pressure its allies to follow its policies and to present the Soviet Union with conditions agreed upon in advance" in order to obstruct a big power conference.

The Bengali newspaper "Freedom Daily" published an editorial saying that peace-loving people all over the world are demanding that the five major powers hold a conference to sign a peace treaty. Even British Prime Minister Churchill suggested holding a big power conference in the British Parliament. However, the U.S. rulers continue to directly oppose the demands of the people of the world. The Americans are not arranging a big power conference, but instead a three-power conference. Commenting on the Bermuda conference, the editorial pointed out: The only fair and acceptable proposal is to hold a big power conference for consultations, abandoning the idea of presenting preconditions to the Soviet Union.

The editorial said: "All the newspapers in West Bengal Province support the fair step proposed in the 'Pravda' editorial."

The Hindi newspaper "Today Daily" of Benares, the Urdu newspaper "People's Daily" of Hyderabad State, and other progressive newspapers in India have all published editorials on the Bermuda conference with the same views.

    印度许多报纸支持“真理报”社论的意见
    指责美国统治者安排百慕大会议阻挠大国会议
    【新华社新德里三十日电】印度各主要报纸二十五日都在要闻版上刊载了“真理报”社论“关于目前的国际形势”的摘要。许多报纸还发表社论，表示同意“真理报”的意见，就是：没有苏联参加的百慕大会议不但不会缓和国际紧张局势，反而会使这种局势恶化。这些社论强调指出：如果举行大国会议，就不应该有预先计划好的条件和政策。举行会议时应该有开诚布公的气氛，而不应该有任何先决条件。
    乌尔都文报纸“新世纪”发表评论说：“真理报”社论表明了苏联要求世界和平与和平谈判的愿望是多么真诚。评论指出：“美国企图通过这次百慕大会议压迫它的盟国追随它的方针，向苏联提出它们事先协议好的条件”，以阻挠大国会议。
    孟加拉文“自由报”发表社论说，全世界爱好和平的人民都要求五大国举行会议以签订和平公约。甚至英国首相邱吉尔也在英国议会中建议举行大国会议。但是美国统治者却继续直截了当地反对全世界人民的要求。美国人不安排大国会议，却安排了三国会议。社论在评论百慕大会议时指出：唯一公正和可以接受的建议是举行大国会议以进行协商，抛掉向苏联提出先决条件的思想。
    社论说：“西孟加拉省的一切报纸都支持‘真理报’社论中所提出的那个公正步骤。”
    贝拿勒斯的印地文“今天报”、海得拉巴邦的乌尔都文“人民报”以及印度其他进步报纸都以同样的见解，发表了关于百慕大会议的社论。
