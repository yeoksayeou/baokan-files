    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 24th (Special Correspondent Wu Min) reports: The resumed delegates' meeting on the 25th will show the world whether the U.S. representatives, after an eight-day recess, hurriedly returned to Panmunjom to consult on the prisoner-of-war issue to seek a quick solution, or to put forward unacceptable demands to slam the door on negotiations.

    Apart from some anti-armistice elements in the United States and South Korea, the whole world unanimously demands a swift agreement and the realization of an armistice based on General Nam Il's eight-point proposal. During the eight-day recess, world opinion strongly supported the eight-point proposal as the basis for reaching an agreement, and at the same time, vehemently criticized Harrison's "counter-proposal" because this "counter-proposal" destroyed the basis for resuming negotiations.

    Judging from the worldwide support for General Nam Il's eight-point proposal, Harrison's lengthy twenty-six-point "counter-proposal" failed to deceive the world. This support shows that the whole world believes that the eight-point proposal is practical, feasible and humane in resolving the prisoner-of-war issue and immediately realizing an armistice in Korea.

    The eight-point proposal is a plan that accommodates the U.S. side's refusal to send non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the territory of a neutral country, while ensuring the prisoners of war have the freedom to return to their hometowns and facilitating their quick return home. The prisoners of war will be removed from the military control of the detaining party and placed under the care of a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in their current detention locations. This is a clear concession to facilitate an agreement. Each member state of the commission will send an equal number of armed forces to guard the prisoners of war. The commission will make arrangements to allow personnel from the prisoners of war's country of origin convenient and free access to explain to the prisoners of war their right to return home and live a peaceful life. If disputes arise, the commission can vote by majority.

    Within a four-month time limit, those who request repatriation will be repatriated without delay. From common sense and all evidence, it can be seen that if the influence and coercion of the detaining party are removed, and proper explanations are given, all prisoners of war will want to return home. Bonner publicly showed the world last year how he used artillery, tanks, flamethrowers, and gas grenades on Koje Island, against the will of the prisoners of war, to conduct screenings to fabricate their "refusal to be repatriated" lie. The returned Korean and Chinese sick and wounded prisoners of war not long ago are living witnesses proving that the U.S. side used unspeakable terror and force to prevent them from daring to go home and force them to lose their minds.

    But under the U.S. side's plan to impose restrictions to deprive prisoners of war of the opportunity to express their willingness to return home, Harrison stubbornly insisted that after the expiration of the time limit, there would be prisoners of war remaining under the custody of neutral countries. In order to prevent this post-armistice assumption from hindering the realization of the armistice, the only reasonable solution to this problem is obviously to submit this issue to a post-armistice political conference.

    Washington's response to this simple and feasible eight-point proposal for an immediate armistice was to abandon the principle of handing over all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral countries, and to impose various restrictions on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and to make the explanations a mere formality, thereby rendering the plan unworkable. Obviously, insisting on these unacceptable demands can only expose to the world more clearly that the U.S. representative is afraid that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will effectively perform its duties, and is afraid that the explanations will make the prisoners of war express their willingness to return home. The only possible explanation for this fear is that the U.S. side is conspiring to detain prisoners of war in the name of "release" and shatter the world's hope for a swift armistice in Korea.

    On the 25th, the U.S. representative has another chance to show the world whether they really want to achieve an armistice. As long as the U.S. side withdraws its unacceptable demands that undermine the basis of the negotiations and truly accepts General Nam Il's eight-point proposal as the basis for reaching an agreement, an immediate armistice can be achieved.

### 今天复会的朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会  将表明美方是否真正想达成停战

    今天复会的朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会
    将表明美方是否真正想达成停战
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：二十五日复会的代表团大会，将向世界表明：美方代表在八天的休会后，匆忙地回到板门店来，是就战俘问题进行协商以求得迅速的解决呢？还是提出无法接受的要求，来砰地关上谈判的大门呢？
    除了美国和南朝鲜的一些反停战分子外，全世界一致要求以南日大将的八条方案为基础，迅速达成协议，实现停战。在八天休会的期间，世界舆论极力支持把八条方案作为达成协议的基础，同时猛烈抨击哈利逊的“反建议”，因为这个“反建议”破坏了恢复谈判的基础。
    从全世界支持南日大将的八条方案看来，哈利逊的冗长的二十六条“反建议”并没有能够欺骗全世界。这种支持表明：全世界认为八条方案在解决战俘问题和立即实现朝鲜停战方面，是实际可行的和合乎人道的。
    八条方案是一个迁就美方拒绝把不直接遣返的战俘送到一个中立国领土上去的意见，而同时又保证战俘得有返回他们家乡的自由和便于他们迅速回家的方案。战俘将摆脱拘留一方的军事控制，而在他们目前被拘留的地方，被置在中立国委员会的看管之下。这是一个明显的让步，以便于达成协议。委员会中的每一个会员国将派同等数目的武装部队来看管战俘。这个委员会将进行安排，使战俘所属的国家的人员有便利和自由，来向战俘解释他们有回家过和平生活的权利。如果发生争执，委员会可以多数票来表决。
    在四个月的时限内，那些要求遣返的人将予遣返，不得拖延。从常识和一切证据都可以看出，如果拘留的一方的影响和强迫被解除，同时再进行适当解释的话，所有的战俘都会要回家的。波纳在去年曾公开地向世界表明，他是怎样在巨济岛上违背着战俘的意志，用大炮、坦克、火焰喷射器和瓦斯手榴弹来进行甄别，以制造他们“拒绝遣返”的鬼话。不久以前回来的朝、中病伤被俘人员就是证明美方使用无可言状的恐怖和武力，使他们不敢回家，并逼得他们丧失理智的活的证人。
    但是在美方横加限制以剥夺战俘有机会表示他们回家意愿的方案下，哈利逊硬说，在时限期满后，会有留在中立国看管的战俘。为了使得这种停战后的假设不致阻碍停战的实现，这个问题的唯一的合理解决办法显然是应把这个问题提交给停战后的政治会议。
    华盛顿对于这个简便而可行的立即停战的八条方案的答复，却是背弃关于将所有不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国看管的原则，并对中立国委员会加以种种限制和使解释流于形式，从而使这个方案行不通。显然，坚持这些不可接受的要求，只能向世界更清楚地暴露美国代表是害怕中立国委员会有效地执行职务，是害怕进行解释会使战俘表示了他们回家的意愿。唯一可能解释这种恐惧的理由，就是美方阴谋以“释放”的名义来扣留战俘，并粉碎全世界要求迅速在朝鲜达成停战的希望。
    二十五日美方代表还有另一次向全世界表明他们是不是真想达成停战的机会。只要美方撤消他们破坏谈判基础的不可被接受的要求，并且真正接受南日大将的八条方案作为达成协议的基础，那么就可立即停战。
