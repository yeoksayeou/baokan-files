Northeast Administrative Committee Holds Meeting to Deploy Basic-Level Election Work

The Northeast Administrative Committee held its second meeting on April 28th to deploy basic-level election work and second-quarter work. The meeting first listened to and approved Vice Chairman Wang Jinxiang's report on basic-level election work, and finally, Vice Chairman Lin Feng made a concluding speech. In his report, Wang Jinxiang gave specific explanations on the steps and timing arrangements for conducting the general election in the Northeast region: Based on the production season conditions in the Northeast region, the basic-level election work is planned to be carried out in two steps, and the general election time for cities and rural areas will be appropriately staggered to facilitate leadership control. The first step is to conduct population surveys and voter registration, which will be completed in rural areas from mid-June to mid-July, and in cities from mid-July to mid-August. The second step is to conduct basic-level elections, which will begin in rural areas after the harvest and strive to be completed by the end of August; in cities, it will begin in early September and be completed by the end of September. The county (city) people's congresses are planned to be convened in October or November. The provincial (municipal) people's congresses will be convened according to the time designated by the central government. To this end, the following preparatory work should be done immediately: (1) The county (city) election committees should all be established by early May and actively carry out various preparatory work for basic-level elections in accordance with the instructions of the Central Election Committee; (2) Do a good job in publicizing the general election. According to the central government's instructions on publicity work for the general election, all localities should immediately launch publicity in May in conjunction with training cadres; (3) Reorganize urban street organizations and establish residents' committees to prepare for the general election in cities.

Wang Jinxiang then pointed out that organizing forces to train cadres is the key to doing a good job in basic-level general elections. Based on the population situation in Northeast cities and villages, the Northeast region needs more than 70,000 general election cadres, who must be trained on time in a concentrated manner. Therefore, the Northeast and various provinces (cities) should transfer a group of cadres to participate in the general election work. The transferred cadres should have a certain level of policy understanding and work ability, and should have a certain proportion of leading backbone personnel. Regarding cadre training, it will be led by the election committees of various provinces (cities) and counties. The provinces should focus on training a group of leading cadres to guide and assist the county's cadre training work. During the training, various documents stipulated by the Central Election Committee should be studied well. Through training, cadres should understand the policies, learn work methods, and clearly understand various work disciplines and reporting systems. The training method will combine centralized training with key experiments. The training time for provinces should begin in mid-May (cities can begin in late June), with a duration of five to seven days; counties should begin in late May, with a duration of three to five days. In order to do a good job in cadre training and ensure teaching quality, for policy training, the main responsible cadres of each province (city) and county are required to lecture in person, and general general election business will be lectured by cadres in charge of civil affairs departments, and population surveys will be lectured by cadres in charge of public security departments. After the cadres are trained, they will be uniformly compiled into work teams by the county election committee, with one team assigned to each district, one group assigned to every three villages, and a chairman of the election committee assigned to each village. The people's court will be established in the district to launch the general election work.

Regarding the methods of basic-level general election work, Wang Jinxiang pointed out that all localities must closely integrate with production when carrying out the general election, so that the general election work can truly become a driving force for promoting production. In order to effectively achieve the five requirements of the Central Election Committee on basic-level elections: (1) Population surveys and voter registration should be registered in rural areas by natural village (hamlet), and in cities by household registration area, according to courtyards and alleys; publicity work should be fully carried out to explain the purpose and significance of population surveys and voter registration, and dispel any concerns that the masses may have; registration should be strictly in accordance with the items listed on the registration form, and no items should be added at will; respect the masses' living customs and habits, and do not limit the registration time to facilitate the masses' production and work. (2) Reviewing voter rights is a very detailed task, and policies must be clearly explained to the masses, and the review targets must be determined with emphasis, strictly preventing the occurrence of various forced confessions and chaotic struggles. (3) Rural basic-level general elections should be combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, but the general election work must be the main focus. The method is: prepare before the general election, with the county responsible for convening meetings in batches, adopting the method of summarizing and deploying work, leading cadres taking the lead in making profound self-criticism, fully promoting democracy, launching criticism and self-criticism, commending good cadres, and exposing various instances of forced orders and bad people and deeds that violate laws and discipline. During the nomination and review of candidates, further discussion and identification by the masses will be conducted, and those who are loved by the masses and have close ties with the masses will be nominated as candidates, and bad people and lawbreakers will be removed, in order to achieve the purpose of educating cadres. In order to do this work well, policies must be grasped accurately and correctly to prevent causing confusion and deviations. (4) Population surveys, voter registration, and basic-level general elections should all be carried out in batches, and a county can generally be divided into three batches. (5) Basic-level elections must seize the time, make use of gaps, emphasize convenience for the masses and convenience for production, emphasize solemnity and simplicity, avoid extravagance and waste, and must promote democracy and prevent all-inclusive substitutions.

Finally, Wang Jinxiang pointed out that the people's governments and election committees of various provinces and cities must strengthen leadership over the basic-level election work, conduct regular inspections, study and summarize experience, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and quickly formulate plans, deploy and implement them to ensure the healthy development of the general election work. In order to grasp the situation in a timely manner and guide the work, starting from mid-June, each province and city should submit a situation briefing to the Central Election Committee and the Northeast Administrative Committee once a week.

At the meeting, Vice Chairman Lin Feng made a concluding speech on the general election work. He said: Conducting general elections and convening people's congresses at all levels are of great significance for further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, improving the people's political enthusiasm, and promoting the country's construction undertakings. It is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation work to the people. Only with the active participation of the broad masses of the people can the general election work be truly done well. Therefore, three links must be paid attention to: First, leaders at all levels must attach importance to this work, and be able to specifically and meticulously grasp every link in the general election, pay attention to studying and implementing relevant policy issues, and pay attention to mobilizing the masses and relying on the enthusiasm of the masses to carry out the work. Second, it must be closely integrated with production and construction. Through the general election, all working people should be mobilized to actively carry out production and construction, and the working methods should also pay attention to meeting this requirement, avoiding extravagance and formalism. Third, it is necessary to train the cadres needed for the general election in a serious manner. When mobilizing cadres, it is necessary to ensure a certain quality, and to make all cadres participating in the general election work understand the significance and importance of this work, and to explain the policies and correct working methods to them, so that they can correctly implement them.

    东北行政委员会开会布置基层选举工作
    东北行政委员会在四月二十八日举行第二次会议，部署基层选举工作和第二季度工作。会议首先听取并通过了汪金祥副主席关于基层选举工作的报告，最后由林枫副主席作了总结发言。汪金祥在报告中对东北区进行普选的步骤和时间的安排问题作了具体的说明：根据东北地区的生产季节情况，基层选举工作拟分为两个步骤进行，并把城市与农村的普选时间适当地错开，以便于掌握领导。第一步进行人口调查与选民登记工作，农村在六月中旬至七月中旬完成；城市在七月中旬至八月中旬完成、第二步进行基层选举，农村在挂锄后开始，争取到八月底完成；城市九月初开始，到九月底完成。县（市）人民代表大会拟于十月或十一月召开。省（市）人民代表大会根据中央指定时间召开。为此，应即做好以下准备工作：（一）县（市）选举委员会应于五月初全部成立起来，根据中央选举委员会的指示积极进行基层选举的各项准备工作；（二）做好普选的宣传工作，根据中央关于普选宣传工作指示，各地五月份应即配合训练干部展开宣传；（三）整理城市街道组织，将居民委员会成立起来，为城市普选做好准备。
    汪金祥接着指出：组织力量训练干部是做好基层普选工作的关键。根据东北城市和乡村人口情况，东北全区需要普选干部七万余人，必须按时集中进行训练，因此东北及各省（市）应抽调一批干部参加普选工作。抽调的干部应具备一定政策水平和工作能力，并应有一定比重的领导骨干。关于干部训练，由各省（市）县选举委员会领导进行。各省要着重训练一批领导干部，以便指导与帮助县的干部训练工作。训练中要学好中央选举委员会所规定的各种文件。经过训练，要使干部懂得政策，学会工作方法，并交清各项工作纪律与请示报告制度。训练方法采取集中训练与重点试验相结合的方法。训练时间省应在五月中旬开始（市可在六月下旬开始），时间为五天至七天；县应在五月下旬开始，时间为三天至五天。为了搞好干部训练工作，保证教学质量，凡政策训练，要求各省（市）县主要负责干部亲自讲课，一般普选业务由民政部门负责干部讲课，人口调查由公安部门负责干部讲课。干部经过训练后，由县选举委员会统一编成工作队，每区派一个队，每三个村派一个组，每村派一选举委员会主席，区设人民法庭，展开普选工作。
    关于基层普选工作的作法，汪金祥指出：各地在进行普选时必须密切结合生产，使普选工作真正成为推动生产的动力。为了切实达到中央选举委员会关于基层选举的五项要求：（一）人口调查与选民登记工作，在农村以自然村（屯）为单位登记，城市以户籍区为单位按院落、胡衕登记；要充分做好宣传工作，说明人口调查与选民登记的目的和意义，解除群众可能产生的某些顾虑；严格按登记表所列项目登记，不准随便增加项目；尊重群众生活风俗习惯，不限定登记时间，以便利群众生产和工作。（二）审查选民权是一件极细致的工作，必须向群众交清政策，有重点地确定审查对象，严格防止各种追逼乱斗现象之发生。（三）农村基层普选要结合反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，但必须以普选工作为主。其方法是：在普选前做好准备，由县负责分批召开会议，采取总结和布置工作的办法，领导干部带头深刻检讨，充分发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评，表扬好干部，揭发各种强迫命令、违法乱纪的坏人坏事。在候选人提名和审查时再经过群众讨论鉴别，把那些被群众爱戴的并与群众有密切联系的人提为候选人，把坏人和违法乱纪分子去掉，以达到教育干部之目的。为了搞好这一工作，必须切实正确地掌握政策，防止造成混乱和偏差。（四）人口调查、选民登记和基层普选均应采取分批进行办法，一个县一般可分三批进行。（五）基层选举必须抓紧时间，利用空隙，强调便利群众、便利生产，强调庄严朴素，切忌铺张浪费，并必须发扬民主，防止包办代替。
    最后汪金祥指出：各省市人民政府和选举委员会，对基层选举工作必须加强领导，经常进行检查，研究总结经验，及时发现问题解决问题，并迅速订出计划，部署执行，保证普选工作的健康开展。为了及时掌握情况指导工作，从六月中旬开始，各省市每星期应向中央选举委员会和东北行政委员会做一次情况简报。
    在会议上林枫副主席作了关于普选工作的总结发言。他说：进行普选，召开各级人民代表大会，对于进一步巩固人民民主专政，提高人民的政治积极性，推动国家的建设事业，具有伟大的意义。要向人民群众进行广泛深入的宣传解释工作。依靠广大人民群众的积极参加才能真正做好普选工作。因此必须注意三个环节：第一，要求各级领导上必须重视这一工作，并能具体地细致地掌握普选中每一个环节，注意研究和贯彻有关的政策问题，注意发动群众和依靠群众的积极性进行工作。第二，必须与生产建设密切结合，要通过普选，发动全体劳动人民积极搞好生产建设，工作方法也要注意适合这一要求，避免铺张和形式主义的做法。第三，要认真训练好普选所需要的干部，在调集干部时要保证一定质量，要使所有参加普选工作的干部明白这一工作的意义和重要性，把政策和正确的工作方法向他们讲清楚，以便正确地贯彻执行。
