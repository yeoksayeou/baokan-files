    Health and medical work has been carried out in various ethnic minority areas of Guizhou Province
    Health work has been widely carried out in the ethnic minority areas of Guizhou Province. In the seventy-two counties in the province where ethnic minorities live in concentrated or scattered communities, 176 health clinics have been established, with 660 doctors and nurses participating in the work. In addition, there is also an ethnic minority maternal and child health work team of 110 people, touring the ethnic minority areas of various special districts. Thirty-five maternal and child health stations and 338 midwifery stations have been established in ethnic minority areas, and 3,780 ethnic minority health workers and smallpox vaccinators, and 1,405 midwives have been trained. In the three years since liberation, the People's Government has conducted health surveys in ethnic minority areas and vigorously promoted health and medical work. In 1952 alone, more than 380,000 ethnic minority people received free treatment. In Anlong, Shuicheng and other counties, infectious diseases have been basically eradicated in many villages where many diseases used to be prevalent. The situation of maternal and child health in various places has also improved. New methods of delivery have been promoted in all areas with health clinics. Seventy percent of the babies in the Kaili Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan are delivered using the new methods. As of December last year, out of the 1,566 babies delivered using the new methods in ethnic minority areas throughout the province, only three died due to prematurity, and the rest grew up healthily. Among the 15,000 women in Shibing County, 10,000 have started using sanitary belts.
    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Holds Training Class for Full-Time Theoretical Instructors of Primary Groups
    The training class for full-time theoretical instructors of primary groups, organized by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, officially opened. The first phase of the training class has more than 180 students and began classes on May 18. The students participating in this training are cadres at or equivalent to the district level drawn from various special districts, cities, counties, provincial-level directly affiliated organs, and major factories and mining enterprises throughout the province, of whom more than 90 percent are Communist Party members. The training period for this phase is scheduled for 45 days, with "Common Knowledge Reader for Economic Construction" as the main course, taught by the main responsible cadres of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and government organs.
    Gansu Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region Establishes Primary Normal School
    The Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region of Gansu Province has established a primary normal school. Dozens of students from Tibetan, Tu, Han and other ethnic groups have begun to study happily in the new school buildings. All their expenses are provided by the People's Government. In recent years, Tibetan children in Tianzhu Autonomous Region have been going to school in large numbers. The number of children enrolled in schools throughout the region has increased tenfold compared with before liberation, but there is a severe shortage of primary school teachers. The Gansu Provincial People's Government specially allocated funds in October last year to establish this primary normal school. This autumn, the normal school will enroll 120 new students and attach a short-term teacher training class specializing in learning Tibetan to train Tibetan language teachers.
    A large number of cultural relics from the Warring States Period and the Western Han Dynasty were discovered in the suburbs of Changsha
    The Ancient Tomb Cleaning Work Team of the Hunan Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee has excavated a large number of valuable ancient cultural relics in the suburbs of Changsha in conjunction with various construction projects. From July last year to the end of April this year, the team excavated and cleaned a total of 596 ancient tombs in Zidanku, Dongtang and other places in the suburbs of Changsha. Most of these ancient tombs are from the Warring States Period and the Western Han Dynasty. More than 5,000 items including pottery, bronzes, lacquerware, and woodenware have been unearthed. Among them, pottery is the most numerous. Among the cultural relics unearthed from a wooden coffin tomb of the Chu State era in Yanjialing, a lacquered dressing case with three legs and one handle is the most eye-catching. The lacquer box has a black background and the patterns are divided into five layers. The first, third, and fifth layers are curly patterns, and the second and fourth layers are hunting patterns. The patterns are very exquisite and are of great value for studying ancient Chinese art. In the tombs of the Warring States period excavated in Dongtang and Zidanku, the bronze bells, bronze spears, piercers, wooden figurines, a balance-like weighing device and a set of bronze weights are the most valuable. There are patterns and characters on the bronze spear. The font is similar to the characters on the bamboo slips of the Warring States period unearthed in Wulipai in the suburbs of Changsha in 1951. In addition, there are also characters on the Li tripod of the late Zhou Dynasty excavated in Longdongpo. These are all materials for studying the characters of the Chu State. An openwork button bronze mirror from the Warring States period was discovered in Yanshanling. The bronze mirror is very thin, with thunder patterns on the back and dragon patterns on the front. The carvings are exquisite, which is also an unprecedented discovery in the cultural relics unearthed in Hunan.

    长沙市郊发现大批战国和西汉时代的文物
    湖南省文物管理委员会古墓葬清理工作队，在长沙市郊结合各项建筑工程发掘了大批有价值的古代文物。该队从去年七月到今年四月底止，在长沙市郊的子弹库、东塘等地，共发掘和清理了五百九十六座古墓。这些古墓大部分是战国和西汉时代的。出土物有陶器、铜器、漆器、木器等五千多件。其中以陶器为最多。在颜家岭从一座楚国时代的木廓墓中出土的文物中，有一个三足一?的漆奁最引人注目。漆奁系黑色底，花纹分五层，第一、三、五层为卷曲纹，第二、四层为狩猎纹，图案非常精美，对研究我国古代艺术很有价值。在东塘和子弹库发掘的两座战国时代的墓中文物以铜铎、铜矛、镦、木俑和一件类似天平的衡器及一套铜制法码最有价值。铜矛上有花纹和字，字体和一九五一年在长沙市郊五里牌出土的战国时代竹简上的文字相类似。另在龙洞坡发掘到的周末时代的鬲，上面也有文字。这些都是研究楚国文字的资料。在燕山岭发现了一个战国时代的空花纽铜镜，铜镜很薄，背面有雷纹，正面有龙纹，雕刻精美，这也是湖南出土文物中前所未有的发现。
