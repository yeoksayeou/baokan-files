The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a notice on the 21st regarding doing a good job in preventing and controlling cotton aphids and spider mites. The notice said: Cotton aphids and spider mites are the main pests in China's cotton-growing areas. Currently, cotton aphids have begun to appear. According to weather forecasts, the above two kinds of insect pests will still occur widely this year. In order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year, the notice requires the agricultural and forestry departments of all major administrative regions and provinces (cities) to study and implement the following points: 1. Mobilize farmers to continue to remove weeds from the edges of cotton fields and conduct field inspections during various agricultural activities. When initial signs of cotton aphids or spider mites are found on cotton plants, the method of combining spot treatment with area-wide prevention and control should be implemented immediately to eliminate them as early as possible. Cotton fields where spider mites have been serious in previous years, as well as cotton fields near field ridges, ditch edges, graves, mulberry trees, etc., where this insect is most likely to occur, should be subject to more thorough inspection. 2. This year, tobacco and cotton oil soap will still be the main agents for preventing and controlling cotton aphids. Lime sulfur mixture will be the main agent for preventing and controlling spider mites, and flour paste can be used in areas with prevention and control habits. In areas where aphids are serious, spray once for general prevention before the cotton leaves curl or before the wheat harvest. If cotton spider mites are found, spray twice continuously every five to ten days. If cotton aphids, spider mites, and thrips occur at the same time, tobacco-lime-sulfur solution or tobacco-flour paste can be used to treat them simultaneously. 3. The agricultural and forestry departments of each province should, according to the cotton field area and the occurrence of cotton pests in previous years, assist cooperatives to quickly allocate and transport pesticides and machinery, changing the phenomenon that large amounts of pesticides and machinery are still stored in special districts and county cooperatives after insect pests occur; and according to the central government's instruction to have pesticides and pest control equipment ready for use, and the actual needs of cotton pest pesticides and machinery in the province, check the preparation situation, and if the number is insufficient, consult with the provincial finance and economics committee and related units such as cooperatives and the People's Bank to study and solve the problem. 4. Use various publicity methods to conduct technical training in a timely manner, so that cotton farmers can learn simple pest control and drug preparation techniques. Provinces that have established prevention and control demonstration areas should strengthen the leadership of the demonstration areas, so that they can play a role and lay a favorable foundation for future expansion of prevention and control.

    中央农业部通知各地要做好防治棉蚜、红蜘蛛的工作
    中央人民政府农业部在二十一日发出关于做好棉蚜、红蜘蛛防治工作的通知。通知中说：棉蚜、红蜘蛛是我国棉区的主要害虫。目前，棉蚜已开始发生。根据气候预报，上述两种虫害，今年仍将普遍发生。为了争取今年棉花丰收，通知要求各大行政区和各省（市）农林部门研究执行以下各点：一、发动农民继续清除棉花田边的杂草，并在各种农事活动中进行田间检查。当发现棉株上有棉蚜或红蜘蛛的初期为害征象时，应即贯彻点片结合的防治办法，及早消灭。往年红蜘蛛为害严重的棉田以及靠近田埂、沟沿、坟堆、桑棵等最易发生此虫的棉田，尤应加强检查工作。二、今年防治棉蚜的药剂仍以烟草、棉油皂为主。防治红蜘蛛以石灰硫磺合剂为主，有防治习惯地区可酌用面糊水。蚜害严重地区应于棉花卷叶前或麦收前喷药普治一遍，发现棉红蜘蛛为害，应每隔五天至十天连续喷药两次。如棉蚜、红蜘蛛、蓟马同时发生，可用烟草石灰硫磺液或烟草面糊水兼治。三、各省农林部门应根据各地棉田面积和历年棉虫发生情况，协助合作社迅速做好药械的调拨分运工作，改变往年虫害发生后大量药械仍积存在专区、县合作社的现象；并根据中央对农药和治虫器械供应有备无患的指示，和本省棉虫药械的实际需要量，检查准备情况，不足之数，可商请省财政经济委员会与合作社、人民银行等有关单位研究解决。四、利用各种宣传方式，及时进行技术传授工作，使植棉农民学会简单的治虫配药技术。已设置防治示范区的各省，要加强示范区的领导工作，使其发挥作用，并为今后扩大防治打下有利基础。
