Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Liu Changsheng, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the afternoon session of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on the 6th, endorsing the World Federation of Trade Unions' call for the Third World Trade Union Congress. Liu Changsheng said: In the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, economic construction is flourishing, workers' lives are becoming increasingly happier, and the forces of people's unity are growing stronger. All this fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist people's democratic political system.

However, in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries, due to the war preparations policies of their governments, millions of working brothers and sisters are suffering unbearable exploitation, unemployment, poverty, hunger, and brutal persecution. Reactionary rulers are increasingly depriving workers of their trade union rights and democratic rights, massively firing workers, especially active members; and trade union cadres are constantly subjected to illegal arrests and persecution. Therefore, workers' struggles against unemployment, to defend trade union rights, democratic rights, and improve their lives have greatly developed. Workers' united action is becoming more and more common and vigorous. Despite the rulers' suppression, persecution, and arrests, the workers' unyielding struggle is growing strongly.

Liu Changsheng said: The World Federation of Trade Unions has resolutely led the workers' struggle in various ways. In light of the above situation and based on its consistent spirit of striving for unity and unification of the international labor movement, it has decided to convene the Third World Trade Union Congress – a congress truly representing the working men and women of the world – in Vienna in October this year. This congress is a congress of unity and solidarity of workers worldwide. It will be convened on a broad mass basis. Not only can members of the World Federation of Trade Unions elect representatives to participate in the congress, but also those trade union organizations that have not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions can elect representatives to participate as long as they are willing to defend the interests of the working people and the cause of peace.

Liu Changsheng emphasized the importance of worker solidarity with the Chinese working class's experience in struggle, saying: The victorious experience of the Chinese working class's struggle proves that workers have strength when they are united. In continuous collective struggles, they demonstrate class mutual assistance and fraternity, raise their awareness, and make continuous progress. Therefore, where there is unity, there is a guarantee of victory. This is a universal truth.

Liu Changsheng said: The Chinese working class deeply knows that the Third World Trade Union Congress to be convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions will play an extremely important role in further uniting the vast number of workers around the world to improve their lives and defend democratic rights. The Chinese working class has always valued international solidarity and support, and we actively endorse and support the convening of the congress.

Liu Changsheng asked all representatives to put into practice the instructions of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the representative of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on strengthening solidarity with the international working class. Liu Changsheng said: In order to strengthen the preparatory work for the Third World Trade Union Congress, I propose the following suggestions to the congress:

First, I suggest that the congress adopt a resolution endorsing the Third World Trade Union Congress. And it should be stipulated that when all the representatives go back to convey the resolutions of this congress, they must publicize and discuss the World Federation of Trade Unions' resolutions and appeals regarding the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress among the broad masses of workers and staff. Continue to promote the great spirit of internationalism, express unlimited sympathy for the suffering and persecution encountered by our class brothers in capitalist colonial and semi-colonial countries, and support their struggles. The Chinese working masses understand that their struggle is our struggle, and their victory is our victory.

Second, I suggest that we must mobilize the masses of workers to respond to the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress with practical actions to improve quality, strictly economize, reduce costs, and strive to fulfill and over fulfill the state's economic plans.

Third, I suggest that this congress elect outstanding national trade union workers and labor models in production as representatives to attend the Third Trade Union Congress convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions. And under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, make full and necessary preparations for participating in the Third Congress to ensure that we fulfill our responsibilities to the congress.

Liu Changsheng finally suggested: While the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation headed by Comrade Louis Saillant is in China, jointly discuss with the representatives of various countries participating in this congress specific methods and steps on how to strengthen the preparatory work for the Third World Trade Union Congress, maintain close contact with each other, exchange experiences in preparatory work, exchange information, and elect a widely representative delegation to attend the congress. Let us all work together to make this congress a success.

Liu Changsheng finally said: We deeply feel that the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress is a major event in international life and a matter of utmost importance to the labor movements of all countries. We must actively participate in its preparatory work, and we have a responsibility to make this congress a success!

    刘长胜在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上发言
    拥护世界工联召开世界工会第三次代表大会
    【新华社六日讯】世界工会联合会书记、上海总工会主席刘长胜在中国工会第七次全国代表大会六日下午会议上，作了关于拥护世界工联召开世界工会第三次代表大会的发言。刘长胜说：在苏联和各人民民主国家中，经济建设蓬勃发展，工人生活日益幸福，人民团结的力量日益强大。这一切充分说明了社会主义人民民主政治制度的优越性。
    但是，目前在资本主义、殖民地及半殖民地国家里，由于本国政府的备战政策，千百万的工人兄弟姊妹们正在遭受着不堪忍受的剥削、失业、贫困、饥饿和残酷的迫害；反动统治者日益剥夺着工人的工会权利和民主权利；大批地开除工人，尤其是工人的积极分子；工会干部不断遭到非法的逮捕和迫害。因此，工人们的反对失业、保卫工会权利、民主权利及改善生活的斗争，大大地发展了。工人们的统一行动，越来越普遍，越来越有劲。尽管统治者镇压、迫害、逮捕，工人们的不屈不挠的斗争强烈地增长着。
    刘长胜说：世界工联以各种方法坚决地领导了工人的斗争，并且针对着上述情况，本着一贯为国际工运团结统一而努力的精神，决定在今年十月间在维也纳召开世界工会第三次代表大会——真正代表全世界男女工人的代表大会。这个大会是全世界工人统一团结的大会，它将在广泛的群众基础上召开，不只是世界工联的会员可以选出代表参加大会，而且连那些还没有参加世界工联的工会组织，只要他们愿意保卫劳动人民的利益和和平事业，同样地可以选出代表参加大会。
    刘长胜以中国工人阶级的斗争经验强调说明工人团结的重要性，他说：中国工人阶级的斗争胜利经验证明工人们团结起来就有力量，在不断的集体的斗争中，发挥着阶级互助及友爱，提高觉悟，不断进步。因此，那里有团结，那里就有胜利的保证，这是一个普遍的真理。
    刘长胜说：中国工人阶级深切知道世界工联将召开的世界工会第三次代表大会，这对进一步地团结全世界广大工人改善生活，保卫民主权利将起着极其重大的作用。中国工人阶级一向重视国际的团结支援，我们积极拥护与支持大会的召开。
    刘长胜要求全体代表把中国共产党中央委员会代表刘少奇同志提出的关于加强与国际工人阶级团结的指示贯彻到实际行动中去。刘长胜说：为了加强世界工会第三次代表大会的准备工作，我向大会提出以下的建议：
    第一、我建议大会通过一个拥护世界工会第三次代表大会的决议。并且规定当各位代表回去传达这次大会决议的同时，必须把世界工联有关召开世界工会第三次代表大会的决议和号召书，在广大职工群众中进行宣传和展开讨论。继续发扬国际主义的伟大精神，对目前资本主义殖民地半殖民地国家的阶级兄弟所遭遇的痛苦及迫害，寄予无限的同情，并支持他们的斗争。中国工人群众懂得：他们的斗争，就是我们的斗争，他们的胜利，就是我们的胜利。
    第二、我建议我们必须动员工人群众以提高质量，严格节约，降低成本，努力完成国家和超额完成国家的经济计划的实际行动来响应世界工会第三次代表大会的召开。
    第三、我建议通过这次大会选出全国优秀的工会工作者和生产上的劳动模范作为出席世界工联召开的第三次工会代表大会的代表。并且在中华全国总工会领导之下，对参加三次大会作充分的及必要的准备，保证完成我们对大会应负的责任。
    刘长胜最后建议：乘以路易·赛扬同志为首的世界工联代表团在中国的时候，与参加这次大会的各国代表们共同商讨如何加强世界工会第三次代表大会筹备工作的具体办法及步骤，互相保持密切联系，交流准备工作的经验，互通情报，选出广泛代表性的代表团出席大会，我们大家共同努力来开好这个大会。
    刘长胜最后说：我们深深感到世界工会第三次代表大会的召开，是国际生活中一件重大事情，而对各国工运是一件极关重要的事情，我们必须积极参加它的准备工作，我们有责任把这次大会开好！
