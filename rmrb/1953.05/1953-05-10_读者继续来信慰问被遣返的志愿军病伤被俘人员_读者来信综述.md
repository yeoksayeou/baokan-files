    Readers Continue to Send Letters of Condolence to Repatriated Volunteer Army Sick, Wounded, and Captured Personnel
    This newspaper continues to receive many letters from readers expressing deep concern and warm greetings to the Volunteer Army's sick, wounded, and captured personnel who have returned to the embrace of the motherland. Zheng Peigui, captain of the Third Brigade of the Huai River Project in Fugou, Henan, and head of the Third District of Fugou County, wrote: "On behalf of the 40,000 people in the Third District of Fugou, I extend my condolences to you, hoping that you will take good care of your health and cherish your bodies." He also proposed to use the practical action of completing the Huai River project ahead of schedule as a gift of condolence to them. All the students of the Central University of Finance and Economics wrote: "We have been eagerly expecting you to return to the motherland. On the morning of April 20th - when both sides exchanged and repatriated sick and wounded prisoners of war, the students happily told each other: 'Our dear comrades have arrived at Panmunjom and are about to return to the embrace of the motherland.'"
    Readers paid tribute to the indomitable spirit of our captured personnel in their righteous struggle against the enemy. Xia Zuxun from the Beijing Machine Manufacturing Industrial School wrote: "I saw in the newspaper that you insisted on the struggle for repatriation. The people of the motherland are deeply concerned and actively support your struggle, and feel extremely hatred for the atrocities of the US side." Students from the Beijing Institute of Technology and the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics wrote: "Students from our two schools feel boundless anger at the atrocities of the US side. Your unwavering will to return to the motherland and your just struggle against the enemy's 'screening' conspiracy and protest against the enemy's bloody suppression thoroughly exposed the US side's so-called 'humanitarianism' and 'voluntary repatriation' lies." All the teachers of the Social Science Teaching Group of Beijing No. 3 Middle School said in their letter of condolence: "Your heroic struggle has educated us again and again, and inspires us to work better for the motherland." The students of Class 32 of the Beijing Russian Language School also expressed their desire to learn from their fighting spirit to overcome difficulties in their studies. Many readers also reported on the construction of the motherland in their letters. Air Force soldier Yang Chunde wrote in his letter: "In the years since you went abroad, the face of the motherland has changed greatly. The Volunteer Army bravely blocked US imperialism in Korea, and the people of the motherland are building our common paradise - the motherland - in a peaceful environment. The chimneys of the motherland's factories are springing up like mushrooms after rain, and Anshan has also seen highly automated factories; the railway tracks are being laid rapidly, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan have been waiting for for more than 40 years, has been opened to traffic; many of the rivers and lakes that used to cause disasters have been transformed into huge water conservancy projects, and the Huai River project is being carried out on a large scale... You have returned to the motherland today, and the people of the motherland warmly welcome you. The motherland has prepared well-equipped hospitals for you to treat your illnesses and injuries. Comrades, rest happily! When you recover your health, let us build a happy and beautiful motherland together!"

    ——读者来信综述
    本报继续收到不少读者来信，向返回祖国怀抱的志愿军病伤被俘人员表示深切的关怀和热情的慰问。河南扶沟治淮第三大队队长兼扶沟县第三区区长郑培贵来信说：“我代表扶沟三区四万人民向你们慰问，望你们好好养病养伤，保重身体。”并提出要用提前完成治淮任务的实际行动作为给他们的慰问品。中央财经学院全体同学来信说：“我们一直以迫切的心情期望你们返回祖国。四月二十日上午——双方交换遣返病伤战俘的时候，同学们都欣慰地相告：亲爱的同志们已经到了板门店，要回到祖国怀抱来了。”
    读者们对我方被俘人员坚贞不屈地向敌人进行正义斗争的精神致以敬意。北京机器制造工业学校夏祖勋来信说：“在报纸上看到你们坚持遣返的斗争。祖国人民都深切关怀和积极支援你们的斗争，并对美方的暴行感到万分的憎恨。”北京工业学院和北京航空学院的同学来信说：“我们两校同学对美方的暴行感到无比的愤怒。你们不可动摇的返回祖国的意志和反对敌人‘甄别’阴谋、抗议敌人血腥镇压的正义斗争，彻底揭穿了美方的所谓‘人道’和‘自愿遣返’的鬼话。”北京市第三中学社会科学教学组全体教师在慰问信中说：“你们英勇的斗争使我们一次又一次地受到教育，并激励着我们更好地为祖国而工作。”北京俄文专修学校三十二班的同学们并表示要学习他们的斗争精神，来克服学习中的困难。不少读者在来信中还报告了祖国建设的情况。空军战士杨春德来信中说：“你们出国数年以来，祖国的面貌大大不同了。志愿军在朝鲜英勇地挡住美帝国主义，祖国人民在和平环境里建设着我们共同的乐园——祖国。祖国工厂的烟囱正像雨后春笋一样竖立起来，鞍山还出现了高度自动化的工厂；火车铁轨正在迅速地铺设，四川人民盼了四十多年的成渝铁路已经通车了；不少过去为害成灾的江湖都被变为巨大的水利，治淮工程正大规模地进行着……。你们今天回到祖国来了，祖国人民热烈地欢迎你们，祖国已经准备了设备优良的医院给你们治病疗伤。同志们，愉快地休养罢！等到你们恢复健康了，我们一同来建设幸福美丽的祖国！”
