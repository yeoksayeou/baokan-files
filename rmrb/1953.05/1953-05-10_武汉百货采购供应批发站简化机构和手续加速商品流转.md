The state-owned Wuhan Department Store Procurement and Supply Wholesale Station, in mid-March, mobilized its staff to conduct a review of economic accounting, simplifying its organizational structure and procedures. In the past, it took thirteen days to complete the procedures for incoming or outgoing goods, but now the incoming goods procedures have been shortened to four or five days, and the outgoing goods procedures can be completed on the same day or the next day in Wuhan City, and on average four or five days for other department stores. This has accelerated commodity circulation, reduced costs, and lowered the supply price of 90 percent of the commodities by 1 to 3 percent.

The original organizational structure of the wholesale station was very unreasonable, the system was chaotic, and the procedures were cumbersome. When setting up the organizational structure, the station considered mitigating its own responsibilities too much, and did not adequately consider simplifying procedures and systems based on the principle of accelerating commodity circulation, and clarifying the responsibilities of the staff. In the professional division of labor by commodity category, they could not adapt to the needs of commodity sales, procurement, processing, storage, pricing, and accounting. Therefore, some units could not play their due role, but instead replaced the work of other units, increasing the confusion of work. The contract section should have supervised and inspected the establishment and execution of contracts, but the section was busy all day long with contacting transactions and signing contracts, which should have been handled by professional sections familiar with commodity quality, specifications, origin, and destination. The storage and transportation section should have led the storage staff to improve warehouse operations, so that the storage staff and business personnel could cooperate closely to accelerate commodity circulation, but they instead replaced the professional sections in controlling inventory, handling entry and exit procedures, and recording commodity storage accounts. In this way, the professional sections could not directly understand the inventory situation, and three procedures were added through the storage and transportation section in the delivery process, an extra set of storage accounts was set up, wasting manpower and time, making it difficult for the goods and accounts to match. Although the professional sections were divided into four sections according to commodities, they were constrained by the contract section and the storage and transportation section, and could not directly grasp the entry, sale, and storage of commodities, and their work was passive, which made it impossible for the sections to play their due role. It took eight steps to dispatch a shipment, with 137 seals stamped on various documents, taking thirteen days.

The Wuhan Department Store Procurement and Supply Wholesale Station, in accordance with the spirit of implementing economic accounting, and in conjunction with the rationalization proposals put forward by the station's employees, has initially corrected this shortcoming. They reorganized the contract section into a contract inspection team, as an assistant to the manager, specializing in reviewing, inspecting, and urging the establishment and execution of contracts. A procurement and supply section was established, with four professional groups, based on the original four professional sections, responsible for the procurement, supply, processing, ordering, negotiation, transaction, contract signing, handling of delivery, calculation of prices, and recording of storage accounts of the commodities under the jurisdiction of each group, and mastering the overall production and sales situation. The transportation personnel of the original storage and transportation section were incorporated into the procurement and supply section to form a transportation group, responsible for unified delivery of goods. Another secretary was established to be responsible for the liaison between the requisitioning units and the work of each group within the section. A transit section was established on the basis of the original storage and transportation section, specializing in the transfer of materials from brother wholesale stations through the Wuhan wholesale station; formulating transit transportation plans for transit materials, and setting up separate accounts to facilitate the calculation of expenses, so as to avoid confusion with the expenses of the station. All wholesale retail departments of the Wuhan wholesale station under the jurisdiction of Wuhan City were transferred to the leadership of the Wuhan Department Store Company to become independent accounting units. This allows the wholesale station to concentrate its efforts on doing a good job in the supply work in the Wuhan area, and can reduce unnecessary disputes in the distribution of goods.

Since the implementation of the new plan, good results have been achieved. In the past, many department stores in the counties around Wuhan City often experienced stockouts of goods due to the bloated organization and inflexible allocation of the Wuhan wholesale station, or lost money because the wholesale station's commodity prices were higher than the listed prices. This phenomenon has changed. The supply price of 90 percent of the commodities supplied by the wholesale station to the department stores in various counties has been reduced by 1 to 3 percent.

    武汉百货采购供应批发站简化机构和手续加速商品流转
    国营武汉百货采购供应批发站，在三月中旬发动职工进行经济核算的复查工作，简化了组织机构和手续。过去要十三天才能办完进货或出货手续，现在进货手续缩短到四、五天可办完，出货手续在武汉市的当天或次日能办完，其他各百货商店平均四、五天能办完。这就加速了商品流转，减低了费用，使百分之九十的商品的供应价格，降低了百分之一到百分之三。
    该批发站原来的组织机构很不合理，制度很混乱，手续很繁杂。该站在设置组织机构时，过多地从减轻自己的责任来考虑问题，而没有很好地考虑必须在加速商品流转的原则下来简化手续制度，并分清工作人员的责任。他们在商品类别划分的专业分工上，不能适应商品推销、采购、加工、保管、作价、会计等方面的需要，因此有些单位不能发挥自己应有的作用，而是代替了其他单位的工作，增加了工作的混乱。合同科本来应监督检查合同的订立和执行情形，但该科却终日忙于接洽交易、签订合同等工作，而这些工作本来应由熟悉商品品质、规格、来路、去路的专业科办理。储运科应该领导保管人员改进仓库业务，使保管员和业务人员密切配合以加速商品流转，但他们却代替专业科掌握库存，办理出入库手续，记载商品保管账。这样专业科就不能直接了解库存情况，在发货过程中增加了通过储运科的三道手续，多设了一套保管账，浪费了人力和时间，使货账不易相符。专业科虽然按商品划分四科，但受了合同科、储运科的牵制，没有和保管人员取得联系，不能直接掌握商品进、销、存的情况，工作被动，这样就使各科不能发挥应有的作用。出一次货要经过八个环节，在各种单据上盖一百三十七个印章，需时十三天。
    武汉百货采购供应批发站根据贯彻实行经济核算制的精神，结合该站职工所提的合理化建议，初步纠正了这种缺点。他们把合同科改组为合同检查组，作为经理的助手，专门审核、检查、督促合同的订立和执行。建立了采购供应科，设四个专业组，以原来的四个专业科为基础组成，负责各组所管商品的采购、供应、加工、订货、谈判交易、订立合同、办理提货、计算价格、记载保管账等工作，并掌握全面的产销情况。把储运科的运输人员编入采购供应科，成立运输组，负责统一发送货物。另设秘书负责要货单位和科内各组工作的联系事项。在原储运科基础上建立中转科，专门负责各兄弟批发站经武汉批发站中转物资的转运工作；对中转物资编造中转运输计划，单独设立账簿，便于计算费用，以免和本站费用混淆。把武汉批发站所属武汉市批发门市部一律划归武汉市百货公司领导，成为独立核算单位。这样可使批发站集中力量做好武汉地区的供应工作，可以减少在分配商品上不必要的纠纷。
    实行新方案以后，收到了良好效果。过去武汉市周围很多县的百货商店因武汉批发站机构臃肿，调拨不灵，经常发生商品脱销，或因批发站商品价格高于牌价而赔钱等现象，这种现象已有改变。批发站供应各县百货商店的商品，有百分之九十的供应价格降低了百分之一到百分之三。
