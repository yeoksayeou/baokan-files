    French Strike Movement Rises
    Strike of Workers of Various Merchant Shipping Companies Continues to Expand
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Paris News: French workers are resolutely fighting to improve their lives and defend their trade union rights.
    The strike of employees of various French merchant shipping companies, which began in late April to demand a shorter work week and more holidays, continues to expand, and this strike has brought French ports to a virtual standstill. Tugboat workers in the port of Marseille, following the decision of the joint conference of the French General Confederation of Labor and the Catholic trade union organization, joined the strike on the evening of the 4th. In Marseille alone, more than 50 ships are unable to sail. In the port of Le Havre, France's largest mail ship, the "Liberte", just returned from New York, and the crew joined the strike along with the crews of other ships such as the mail ship "Ile de France", the "Antilles", the giant freighter "Winnipeg", and many other ships. Other important French ports such as Nantes, Rouen, and Dunkirk have also had their activities suspended due to the strike of merchant seamen.
    The workers of the state-owned Renault automobile factory, who have been on strike since mid-April and number tens of thousands, are still insisting on their demands for improved treatment. The factory was unable to break the workers' unity, and from the 7th, it closed the factory indefinitely and occupied it with security guards. The situation is tense.
    Gas workers in the suburbs of Paris went on strike for 24 hours on the 4th, demanding higher wages; gas workers in other places then also held short strikes.
    The strike of hotel workers in Paris has spread to the provinces on the 5th.
    The Paris subway and bus workers, who have been holding sporadic strikes in recent months, are also discussing holding a four-hour "warning strike" next week to support their wage demands.

    法国罢工运动高涨
    各商船公司职工的罢工继续扩大
    【新华社讯】巴黎消息：法国工人坚决为改善生活和保卫工会权利而斗争。
    法国各商船公司职工为要求缩短工作周和增加假日而于四月下旬开始的罢工继续扩大，这一罢工已使法国各海港几乎完全陷于瘫痪。马赛港的拖驳船工人遵照法国总工会和天主教工会组织联席会议的决定，在四日晚参加了罢工。现在仅马赛一个港，就有五十多艘船只无法开行。在哈佛尔港，法国最大的一艘邮船“自由”号刚从纽约开回，船员就和邮船“法兰西之岛”号、“安的列斯”号、巨型货船“温尼培”号等其他许多船只的船员一道参加罢工。法国其他重要海港如南特、卢昂和敦刻尔克等也因为商船职工罢工，活动停顿。
    从四月中旬开始罢工的拥有好几万工人的国有化的雷诺汽车工厂工人，仍坚持他们的改善待遇的要求。厂方无法破坏工人们的团结，七日起无限期关厂，并由保安队实行占领。形势紧张。
    巴黎近郊煤气工人在四日罢工二十四小时，要求增加工资；其他一些地方的煤气工人接着也举行了短时罢工。
    巴黎旅馆业工人的罢工在五日已经扩展到各省。
    近月来不断举行零星罢工的巴黎地下电车和公共汽车工人，也正在讨论在下星期举行四小时“警告罢工”，来支持他们的工资要求。
