Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 24th: As the Japanese economic crisis deepens day by day under the restrictions of the "embargo," a growing number of social strata in Japan are voicing demands for the promotion of Sino-Japanese trade.

The national meeting of municipal assembly speakers from all over Japan was held in Tokushima, Shikoku, on the 9th. At the meeting, many municipal assembly speakers emphasized the role of promoting Sino-Japanese trade in alleviating Japan's current economic crisis. The meeting adopted a resolution demanding the immediate abolition of all laws and regulations hindering trade between Japan and China in order to promote Sino-Japanese trade.

The universality of the demand for promoting Sino-Japanese trade is also reflected in the new Japanese Diet (Parliament) after the general election, where the "Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade" remains the largest parliamentary organization. Most of the Diet members who participated in the "Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade" before the dissolution of the Diet were re-elected in the general election in April. In the newly elected Diet, there are now 217 members of the "Diet Members' League for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade." This number is still increasing, with new members from the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Left-wing Socialist Party, the Right-wing Socialist Party, and other parties applying to join this parliamentary organization.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 24th: TASS, New York, May 23rd: The trade embargo policy implemented by the United States against democratic countries is extremely detrimental to Japan.

It is well known that import trade is very important to the Japanese economy. In an article commenting on the Japanese economy, the American magazine "Fortune" said: Japan relies on the following imports to supplement its needs: 100 percent of cotton, wool, rubber, nickel, iron bauxite, tin, and oil; 82 percent of iron sand; 80 percent of salt; 70 percent of coke; 50 percent of manganese; and 20 percent of grain. The United States has stipulated extremely unreasonable prices for most of these goods. For example, Japan has to buy coal from the United States at very high prices, while it could buy it from neighboring countries at much lower prices.

According to statistics, the price of rice purchased by Japan from the United States last year was 74 percent higher than the price in the Japanese domestic market. The price of flour was 58 percent higher, the price of cotton was 74 percent higher, and the price of salt was 69 percent higher.

    日本市议会议长会议要求促进日中贸易
    美国的“禁运”政策使日本经济危机一天比一天深刻化
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：随着在“禁运”的限制下日本经济危机一天天的深刻化，日本广大社会阶层也愈来愈普遍地发出要求促进日中贸易的呼声。
    日本全国各地的市议会议长于九日在四国的德岛举行了全国市议会议长会议。会上，许多市议会议长都强调说明促进日中贸易对于缓和日本当前经济危机的作用。会议作出了一项决议，要求立即废除一切阻碍日本和中国进行贸易的法律和规定，以促进日中贸易。
    促进日中贸易的要求的普遍性，也反映在在大选后的日本新国会中，“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”（前译“日中贸易促进议员联盟”）仍然是国会最大的议员组织。在国会解散以前参加“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”的议员，大部分仍在四月间的大选中当选。在新选出的国会中，现在有“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”的会员二百一十七人。这个数目还在陆续增加中，共产党、劳农党、左派社会党、右派社会党和其他党派的新议员都纷纷在申请参加这个议员的组织。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：美国对民主国家实行的贸易禁运政策对日本极为不利。
    大家知道，进口贸易对日本经济是非常重要的。美国的“幸福杂志”在评论日本经济的一篇论文中说：日本得依靠以下各种进口来补足它的需要：棉花、羊毛、橡胶、镍、铁矾土、锡、石油各百分之百，铁砂百分之八十二，盐百分之八十，焦炭百分之七十，锰百分之五十，粮食百分之二十。美国把这些货物的绝大部分都规定了极不合理的价格。例如，日本得以很高的价钱从美国购买煤，而它本来是可以用低廉得多的价钱从邻近国家购买的。
    另据统计，日本去年由美国购买的大米的价格较日本国内市场的价格要高百分之七十四。面粉价格要高百分之五十八，棉花价格要高百分之七十四，盐的价格要高百分之六十九。
