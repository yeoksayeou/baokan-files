Xinhua News Agency, May 30th. Since April, grain has been transferred from all over the country to support disaster-stricken areas such as Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong. Because people across the country, especially in disaster areas, are very concerned about the grain transfer situation, Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the head of the Central People's Government Ministry of Food on this issue.

The head of the Ministry of Food told our reporter: "The Central People's Government has transferred a total of over 1.82 billion jin (over 900,000 tons) of grain from various regions to support disaster areas. This figure, added to the grain reserves of local state-owned grain companies, cooperatives, and farmers in disaster areas, is sufficient to solve the food shortage problem for disaster victims. Because state-owned grain enterprises have always played a leading role in the grain market, their grain reserves are normally sufficient to regulate the local market. In the past three years, some areas in these provinces have had bumper harvests, so many farmers also have some grain reserves, especially some well-off farmers who have more abundant reserves. If these figures are calculated, the grain shortage problem in disaster areas can be basically solved. It is for this reason that after large quantities of grain were transported to disaster areas, the tense situation that once appeared in the disaster area markets in the past month has basically improved. Currently, wheat is already on the market in nine provinces south of the Yangtze River in our country. Among them, Zhejiang has a bumper wheat harvest, Sichuan's wheat production has increased by 10%, and wheat harvests in other provinces are also good. People in the Jiangnan area are accustomed to eating rice, and the vast majority of the newly available wheat will enter the market, and the state will organize purchases. Along the Yellow River basin, China's main wheat-producing areas (including disaster-stricken areas), some wheat is blossoming, and some has turned yellow; in about ten days or half a month, a large amount of new grain will be on the market. Some farmers' surplus grain has begun to be sold to the market. Therefore, grain prices in disaster areas have stabilized, and farmers can now concentrate on production."

The head of the Ministry of Food said when talking about grain transportation: "Our country has a large land area and inconvenient transportation. Over the years, some areas have had some grain that is difficult to transfer out to meet needs. Take Sichuan Province as an example; historically, there has been very little surplus grain transferred out. Therefore, in the reactionary era, coastal cities often imported large quantities of foreign rice and foreign wheat, while Sichuan Province was shouting 'low grain prices hurt farmers'. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, this extremely unreasonable situation was changed. In 1950, when the country carried out large-scale grain transfer work, 75,000 tons of grain were transferred from Sichuan Province. Later, a certain amount was transferred out every year. This year, it is planned to transfer out 300,000 tons, a historically unprecedented amount. This is not only to support the people in disaster areas but also to improve the economic situation in Sichuan Province. This time, some so-called 'dead corner grain' was also transferred from Fujian, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Gansu, and other provinces. This part of the surplus grain has never been transported out in history, but now the People's Government is planning to transport it out to support disaster areas. In addition, the Northeast, North China, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also have surplus grain transported to disaster areas, and Central South and East China also transferred grain from non-disaster areas to support disaster areas. Therefore, this grain transportation work to support disaster areas is of national scale."

Finally, the head of the Ministry of Food talked about the natural conditions for the growth of grain crops in our country. He said: "Because our country spans the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, the climate across the country, from north to south and from coastal to plateau, varies greatly. Therefore, it is inevitable that natural disasters of varying degrees will occur in some areas every year. Currently, after a few areas have suffered from natural disasters, the People's Government is transporting grain for disaster relief and leading the people in disaster areas to vigorously carry out production for self-salvation. The difficulties brought by the famine to some areas can be completely overcome. The wheat in the disaster-stricken areas of Shandong Province is growing well after efforts to rescue it, and the yield in some areas may still not be lower than last year."

    中央人民政府粮食部负责人
    就运粮救灾问题发表谈话
    【新华社三十日讯】四月份以来，全国各地调运粮食支援河南、安徽、江苏、山东等受灾地区。由于全国人民特别是灾区人民对粮食调运情况十分关心，新华社记者特就此问题访问中央人民政府粮食部负责人。
    粮食部负责人对本社记者说：“中央人民政府为支援灾区，从各地区调运粮食的总数十八亿二千余万斤（九十余万吨）。这一数字加上灾区当地国营粮食公司、合作社和农民手中的存粮是足以解决灾民缺粮问题的。由于国营粮食企业一向在粮食市场上起着领导作用，它的存粮数目在平常情况之下是足够调剂当地市场的了，三年来这些省份的部分地区获得丰收，使得许多农民手中也多少有些存粮，尤其是一部分富裕农民的存粮是较丰裕的。若把这些数字加以计算，那么灾区缺粮问题基本上可以解决。正是这个原因，所以在大批粮食运到灾区之后，过去一个月中，灾区市场一度出现的紧张局势，已经基本好转。现在，我国长江以南有九个省的麦子已经上市。其中浙江小麦丰收，四川小麦增产一成，其他省份小麦收成也还好。江南人民习惯食米，新上市的麦子绝大部分将投入市场，由国家组织收购，沿黄河流域我国主要产麦区（包括受灾区），有的小麦正扬花吐穗，有的已经黄梢，大约只要十天半月时间，将有大批新粮登场上市。有一部分农民的余粮已开始向市场出售。故灾区粮价已经稳定，农民已能安心生产。”
    粮食部负责人在谈到运粮情况时说道：“我国地面大，交通不便，历年来不少地区都有一部分难以调出供应需要的粮食。以四川省为例，历来余粮就很少向外调运。因此，在反动时代，往往沿海城市大量进口洋米、洋麦，而四川省则在叫喊‘谷贱伤农’。中央人民政府成立以后，这一极端不合理的情况才得到改变；一九五○年全国进行大规模的调粮工作时，曾自四川省调出粮食七万五千吨；以后每年也有一定数量的外调；今年计划调出三十万吨，数量之大是空前的。这不仅是为着支援灾区人民，同时也是为着改善四川省的经济情况。这次还自福建、贵州、湖南、广西、甘肃等省调运出一部分所谓‘死角粮’，这部分余粮在历史上都未曾运出过，现在人民政府有计划地把它运出来支援灾区。此外，东北、华北、内蒙古自治区等地区都有余粮运往灾区，中南、华东也由非灾区调运粮食支援灾区。所以说，这次支援灾区的运粮工作是具有全国规模的。”
    最后，粮食部负责人谈到我国粮食作物生长的自然条件。他说：“由于我国跨寒、温、热三带，全国气候，由北方到南方，由滨海到高原，差殊很大。因此，每年都不可避免地在部分地区发生轻重不同的天灾。目前，在少数地区遭到自然灾害后，人民政府一方面运粮救灾，一方面领导灾民大力开展生产自救。灾荒给一部分地区所带来的困难是完全可以克服的。山东省受灾地区的小麦，经过努力抢救以后生长良好，部分地区的产量仍可不低于去年。”
