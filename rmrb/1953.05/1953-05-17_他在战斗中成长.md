    He Grew Up in Battle
    Shen Rufeng
    Yesterday, he was a new soldier with no combat experience; today, he has become a resourceful and courageous combat hero. This should be considered a miracle; however, on the Korean battlefield, this is something that happens frequently in the daily battles. Ma Xinnian, a representative of the returning volunteers who participated in the "May 1st" National Day celebrations, is an example of the heroic spirit he demonstrated during the first test of fire at Shangganling last year.
    At dusk on October 31st, the weather was gloomy, and the clouds mixed with smoke pressed down on the mountain peaks. The reflections of the artillery fire, intensifying wave after wave, cut through the dark night sky. The Battle of Shangganling, which had been fought back and forth for half a month, entered an even more tense and fierce stage. The moment Ma Xinnian had been waiting for day and night finally arrived with this dusk: his company received the order to reinforce the 597.9 Heights of Shangganling. The soldiers, one after another, marched toward the brightly lit front line with excitement. On both sides of the mountain road they passed, in the depths of the valleys, our heavy artillery opened their giant mouths, glaring at the enemy, anti-aircraft guns stretched their necks, looking at the sky, and tanks gathered in groups, waiting for the order to charge. The powerful transportation teams composed of the Korean people rushed to transport food and ammunition to the front-line positions. This picture, which constituted the powerful force of our army and the enthusiastic support of the Korean people, further encouraged the soldiers' confidence in victory. Ma Xinnian felt a sense of joy and excitement when he saw this scene, and his steps became exceptionally light and powerful.
    After entering the tunnel, the entire company rested and waited for orders while listening to the company commander's pre-battle mobilization. Ma Xinnian felt that every word of the company commander was so pleasant to hear, especially the following sentences, which he seemed to feel were mainly directed at him: "Now, the time to test us is coming. We must resolutely hold our positions, carry forward the heroic and tenacious fighting style, annihilate the enemy in large numbers, actively support where it is urgent, and pay attention to coordinating with the artillery."
    On the afternoon of November 1st, the sound of artillery shook the mountains, and the rain kept falling. The battalion commander came to the tunnel to report the battle situation and announced the order to immediately organize forces to support the forward positions of No. 1, No. 3, and No. 7. Almost all the soldiers clenched their fists at the same time and shouted loudly, "I'll go!" The battalion commander said happily, "Everyone's determination is very good, but this time only fifteen people are needed." Ma Xinnian was worried that he would not be selected and broke out in a cold sweat from tension. Fortunately, he was finally included in this team to support the front-line positions. When he heard the battalion commander call his name, he was already relieved, but when he stood in the ranks of the fifteen people, he became a little nervous again. He felt that since he joined the army in Korea, although he had received five red star awards for his training and had been awarded a third-class merit for constructing fortifications, this time he was fighting the vicious enemy, and he had no combat experience at all! Could he complete the major task assigned by his superiors? He also thought of his hometown of Fuyang, the eight acres of land distributed during the land reform, the life at home where he had no worries about food or clothing and was getting better every day, the banks of the Huai River that were forever free from floods, the villagers who happily sent him off to join the volunteer army in March, and the instructions of his mother and the entrustments of his wife before he left. He thought of the squad leader who always taught him and was now standing in front of the team; he thought of the comrades who helped him everywhere and were now standing around him. As he thought, he felt full of strength. He felt as if the superiors ordered him to hold the 597.9 Heights alone, he would definitely be able to complete the task. He took out his certificate of merit and handed it to the battalion commander, saying in a vow-like tone, "I will resolutely hold the position and complete the task. If I sacrifice, please send the certificate of merit to my mother!" Then he followed the squad leader out of the tunnel. As soon as he reached the top of the mountain, he encountered more than a platoon of enemy troops charging towards a friendly neighboring position. He threw himself into the battle without regard for his own safety. The enemy's last attack of the day was repelled. Ma Xinnian killed two enemies. This was the first time he had seen enemies fall in front of him. At this time, his clothes were completely soaked by the rain, but he was so excited that he didn't seem to notice it.
    The next day at dawn, the howling cold wind blew away the dark clouds in the sky. The morning stars revealed their faint light. The enemy began to shell. Zhang Yulin, who was guarding a position with him, was hit in the head by shrapnel and seriously injured. Ma Xinnian's heart was cut like a knife as he watched his comrade's blood flow. He immediately bandaged his comrade with a first-aid kit. He said to Zhang Yulin, "You are seriously injured and should go down. Please tell the company commander that as long as I am alive, I will hold the position! Please rest assured, company commander and comrades!" As soon as Zhang Yulin went down, sixty or seventy enemies, using the cover of smoke bombs, charged towards Ma Xinnian's tunnel. Bullets whizzed around him. His heart burned with the flames of revenge for his comrades. He stood up and threw a demolition charge with all his might into the enemy ranks. With a bang, the explosion knocked down a large number of enemies. Those who were not killed were so frightened that they dropped their guns, held their heads, and fled back. But at this time, thirty or forty more enemies charged from the front right. Ma Xinnian quickly pulled the pin of a grenade, lay down in the fortifications, and waited until the enemy approached within ten meters. He threw the grenade out, followed by several more grenades, killing a dozen enemies. At this time, the comrades in each fortification shouted, "Good job!" and fired at the enemy together, repelling the enemy's charge.
    After a while, the enemy's third attack began. The artillery fire caused dust and smoke to fill the mountain. The cunning enemy, using the cover of fierce artillery fire, began to concentrate its forces to attack the No. 3 main peak position. The words of the company commander, "Actively support where it is urgent!" seemed to echo in his ears again. So he immediately jumped out of the fortifications, carried his submachine gun, and hugged his demolition charge and grenades, rushing up from the side. He lay down next to a large rock. At this time, he saw that there were still more than twenty Japanese devils lying on the ground, waiting for the opportunity to rush up. He aimed at the enemy ranks and threw a grenade. With a loud bang, a devil's arm was blown onto his body. At this time, a shell hit the rock, and the flying rocks hit his chest violently. For a moment, his ears were deafened and bleeding. Immediately afterward, another barrage of artillery fire reawakened him. At this time, the fierce firepower from the No. 3 position had already repelled the enemy's attacks on the left and right flanks, but the enemy on the central route, using the cover of artillery fire, charged up again. Ma Xinnian, watching the enemy about to approach the main peak position, immediately forgot the pain of his wounds, jumped up from the ground, ran forward a few steps, and threw a grenade at the enemy from the side. A burst of explosive smoke immediately rose in the enemy ranks. At this time, the No. 3 position shouted, "Everyone attack, charge!" Ma Xinnian, carrying his submachine gun, charged single-handedly from the side towards the defeated enemy, and a series of sweeps killed and wounded a dozen more enemies. The enemy's last charge of the day was repelled. Ma Xinnian returned to his position. Just at this time, the command post sent people, risking artillery fire, to deliver cigarettes and sweets from the motherland's comfort team. He hugged his submachine gun, leaned against the tunnel, and rested during the intervals of fighting. He held a piece of candy in his mouth, focusing on tasting the taste of the candy that was sweet all the way to his heart. He thought that in the past few days of fighting, he had finally held his position, assisted the neighboring positions, and repelled the enemy's many charges; he felt that he had not disappointed the hopes of the people of the motherland. But he immediately reminded himself: he must hold the position until the final victory of the battle; he must strike the enemy even harder in order to be worthy of the deep friendship of the people of the motherland.
    On the fourth day, the enemy changed its tactics, concentrating greater forces to repeatedly outflank and charge the No. 2 and No. 8 positions on the right side of the main peak, attempting to cut off our army's rear. Ma Xinnian was transferred to the No. 2 and No. 8 positions, promoted to squad leader, and served as an artillery observer for the battalion command post. He led the soldiers to strengthen the fortifications and prepare to meet the enemy's greater offensive. On the morning of the 4th, after the enemy fired artillery for an hour, thinking that all our fortifications had been destroyed, more than three companies of enemies swarmed towards the No. 2 and No. 8 positions. Ma Xinnian saw that the enemy's formation was dense, which was a good opportunity to inflict casualties with artillery fire, so he immediately contacted the battalion command post to request artillery support; and as soon as the enemy entered within range, he waved his hand, and all the machine guns and submachine guns fired at the same time, causing the enemy to turn around and flee. At this time, from the jungles of the mountains behind, from the valleys, from far and near, the cannons roared like a string of pearls, and rows of shells exploded in the ranks of the fleeing enemy, and rows of enemies fell in the sound of the explosion. More than three companies of enemies were thus largely annihilated. In repelling the enemy's charge, Ma Xinnian was wounded in the shoulder again. Everyone advised him to go down and rest, but he seriously refused, saying, "This is not the time for me to go down." That afternoon, he repelled five more enemy charges.
    Ma Xinnian and his comrades held their positions for five days and four nights. Only when the fraternal troops came to relieve them did they return victoriously to the tunnel. In these five days and four nights of fighting, Ma Xinnian himself, with the cooperation of his comrades, repelled seventeen enemy charges, killing and wounding more than eighty enemies. Because of his flexible combat maneuvers, actively supporting neighboring positions, and close cooperation with the artillery, he inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. After the battle, he was awarded a special-class merit once. The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also awarded him the honorary title of "Second-Class Combat Hero." After the training of the Battle of Shangganling, Ma Xinnian has grown into an excellent combatant with both intelligence and courage. (Attached picture)

    他在战斗中成长
    沈如峰
    昨天还是没有作战经验的新战士，今天就变成了智勇双全的战斗英雄，应该算是一种奇迹；但是在朝鲜战场上，这却是在战斗的日日夜夜中经常发生的事。归国参加“五一”节观礼的志愿军代表马新年，在去年上甘岭第一次战火考验中表现的英雄气概就是一个例子。
    十月三十一日黄昏，天气阴沉，乌云混着硝烟压在山头上，一阵紧似一阵的炮火的反光，划破黑暗的夜空。双方反复争夺了半个月的上甘岭战斗进入更加紧张、更加激烈的阶段。马新年日夜盼望的时刻终于随着这个黄昏到来了：他所在的这个连队接到了增援上甘岭五九七点九高地的命令。战士们一个紧跟一个，怀着激动的心情，向着火光闪闪的战线行进。在他们所经过的山道的两旁，在山谷的深处，我军的重炮张着巨口，怒视着敌方，高射炮伸长脖子，探望着天空，战车成群地集结着，等待冲击的命令。朝鲜人民组成的强大的运输队伍，争先恐后地向前沿阵地运送着粮食和弹药。这幅构成我军强大威力和朝鲜人民热烈支援的图画，更加鼓舞了战士们的胜利信心。马新年看到这种情景，感到满心眼的愉快和兴奋，脚步也变得分外轻松和有力了。
    进入坑道以后，全连一边休息待命，一边听着连长战斗前的动员。马新年觉得连长的每句话都是那么动听，尤其是下面几句，他仿佛觉得主要是对他说的：“现在，考验我们的时候就要到了。我们要坚决守住阵地，发扬英勇顽强的战斗作风，大量歼灭敌人，那里紧急就主动地去支援那里，要注意和炮兵的协同动作。”
    十一月一日下午，炮声震撼着山峦，雨不停地下着。营长来到坑道中传达了战况，宣布了要立刻组织力量支援前沿一号三号和七号阵地的命令。全体战士几乎同时捏紧拳头，高声喊着：“我去！”营长高兴地说：“大家的决心很好，但是这次只要去十五个人。”马新年担心自己不能选上，紧张得出了一身大汗。幸运的是他终于被编入这支支援前沿阵地的队伍里了。当他听到营长喊叫他的名字，本来已经松了一口气，但当他站到十五个人的行列里的时候，又有些紧张起来。他觉得自己入朝以来虽然在练兵中得到了五次佩挂红星的奖励，在修筑工事中，也立了三等功，但是这次是和凶恶的敌人战斗，他还没有一点作战经验呀！完得成上级分配给的重大任务吗？他又想起自己的家乡阜阳，想起那土地改革中分来的八亩土地，想起了家里不愁吃，不愁穿，一天好似一天的生活，想起了永远免除了水灾的淮河两岸，想起了三月间欢送自己参加志愿军的乡亲们，想起了临走时母亲的叮咛、妻子的嘱托。想起时时教导他的班长，现在就站在队伍的前面；想起处处都帮助他的战友，现在就站在他的周围。他想着，想着，觉得浑身充满了力量，他仿佛觉得上级要是命令他一个人去守住五九七点九高地，他也一定能够完成任务一样。他掏出立功证交给了营长，宣誓般地说：“我坚决守住阵地，完成任务。假如牺牲了，请把立功证寄给我的母亲！”接着他就随着班长走出了坑道。刚到山头上，正遇上敌人的一个多排的兵力，向友邻阵地冲了上来，他奋不顾身地投入战斗，敌人在这一天的最后一次进攻被打退了。马新年炸死了两个敌人。这是他第一次看到敌人在自己面前倒了下去。这时他的衣服已经完全被雨淋透，但他兴奋得好像并没有觉得一样。
    第二天拂晓，呼啸着的寒风，刮走了漫天的乌云。晨星露出了微弱的光芒。敌人开始打炮了。和他守在一个阵地上的张玉霖被弹片打中头部，负了重伤。马新年看着战友的鲜血直流，心如刀割，他马上用急救包给战友包扎。他对张玉霖说：“你负了重伤，应该下去，请你告诉连长，只要我活着，就要坚守住阵地！请连长和全体同志们放心吧！”张玉霖刚刚下去，有六、七十个敌人借着烟幕弹的掩护，向马新年的坑道冲来。枪弹在他四周呼啸着。他内心燃烧着为战友复仇的愤怒火焰，挺起身来，猛的使劲向敌群中丢了一个爆破筒，轰的一声，炸得敌人倒下了一大片，没有死的也吓得丢了枪，抱着头，回头就逃。但是这时又有三、四十个敌人从右前方冲了上来，马新年赶紧拔掉了手雷的保险针，伏在工事里，待敌人接近到十多公尺时，他把手雷掷了出去，接着又连掷了几个手榴弹，炸死了十来个敌人。这时，各个工事里的战友叫喊着“打得好！”一齐向敌人开火，敌人的冲锋被打退了。
    过了一会，敌人的第三次进攻又开始了。炮火把山头打得尘土飞扬，硝烟弥漫。狡猾的敌人，这时借着猛烈炮火的掩护，开始集中力量攻击三号主峰阵地。连长说过的话：“那里紧急就主动地去支援那里！”仿佛又在他的耳朵里回响。于是他立刻跳出工事，背着冲锋枪，抱着爆破筒和手雷，从侧面冲了上去，在一块大石头的旁边卧倒了。这时，他看到前面还有二十多个鬼子伏在地上，等待着冲上去的机会。他对准敌群扔出一个手雷，只听得轰的
    一声，一条鬼子的胳膊炸到了他的身上。这时一颗炮弹正打在石头上，飞迸起来的石块，猛击着他的胸膛，他一时耳朵里被震得流出了鲜血。紧接着又一阵炮火把他重新唤醒。这时，从三号阵地上打出来的猛烈的火力，已经击退了敌人左右两路的攻击，可是中间一路的敌人，又借着炮火的掩护，冲了上来。马新年看着快要接近主峰阵地的敌人，登时忘记了伤口的疼痛，从地上一跃而起，向前跑了几步，从侧面向敌人猛掷了一个手雷，敌群中立刻腾起一阵爆炸的硝烟，三号阵地上这时高呼着“大家出击，冲啊！”马新年端着冲锋枪，单身从侧面向着溃败的敌人冲去，一连串的扫射，又打死打伤了十来个敌人。当天敌人的最后一次冲锋被打退了。马新年又回到了自己的阵地上。恰在这时，指挥所派人冒着炮火送来了祖国人民慰问团的纸烟和糖果。他抱着冲锋枪，靠着坑道，利用战斗的间隙休息一下，他含着一块糖，专心致志地尝着一直甜到心上的糖的滋味。他想起这几天的战斗中，总算是守住了自己的阵地，援助了友邻的阵地，打退了敌人多次的冲锋；他觉得自己没有辜负祖国人民的希望。但他马上又提醒自己：必须守住阵地，直到战斗的最后胜利；必须加倍地打击敌人，才能无愧于祖国人民的深情厚谊。
    第四天，敌人改变了战术，集中更大的兵力，向主峰右侧的二号和八号阵地反复迂回冲锋，企图切断我军的后路。马新年被调到二号和八号阵地上，升任班长，并担任营指挥所的炮兵观察员。他带领战士们加修工事，准备迎接敌人更大的进攻。四日上午，敌人打了一个钟头的炮火以后，以为我们所有的工事都被它打毁了，接着，三个多连的敌人，就向二号和八号阵地上蜂拥而上。马新年看见敌人队形密集，正是用炮火杀伤的好机会，就立刻向营指挥所联络，要求炮火支援；并且等敌人刚一进到射程以内，就把手一摆，所有的机枪和冲锋枪一齐开火，打得敌人回头就逃。这时从后面大山的丛林中，山谷中，远处，近处，连珠般的大炮怒吼了，成排成排的炮弹在溃逃的敌群中爆响，成排成排的敌人也就在这爆响声中倒了下去。三个多连的敌人就这样被大部歼灭了。在打退敌人的冲锋中，马新年肩上又负了伤，大家劝他下去休息，他严肃地拒绝了，说：“这不是我下去的时候。”当天下午，又击退了敌人五次冲锋。
    马新年和他的战友们在阵地上坚守了五天四夜，直到兄弟部队前来换防，才胜利地回到了坑道。在这五天四夜的战斗中，马新年自己在战友的配合下，打退了敌人十七次冲锋，打死打伤敌人八十多名。由于他作战机动灵活，主动支援友邻，并和炮兵密切配合，杀伤了大量敌人。在战斗结束后，被评记特等功一次。中国人民志愿军政治部并授予“二级战斗英雄”的光荣称号。经过上甘岭战斗的锻炼，马新年已成长为一个智勇兼备的优秀的战斗员了。（附图片）
