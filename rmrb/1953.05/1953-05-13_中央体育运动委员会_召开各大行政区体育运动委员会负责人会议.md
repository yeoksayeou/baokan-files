    Central Sports Commission
    Convenes Meeting of Heads of Sports Commissions of Major Administrative Regions
    The Central People's Government Sports Commission convened a meeting of heads of sports commissions of major administrative regions from April 27th to 30th. In addition to reporting on the sports situation in various regions, the meeting focused on discussing the plan for sports work in 1953.
    The meeting began with a speech by He Long, Director of the Central People's Government Sports Commission. He pointed out that in the three years since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the active efforts of all sports workers, much work has been done in sports, and sports work has a correct direction and clear purpose. The popularization of sports has been greatly developed, and it has begun to have a certain effect in improving people's health and serving production, study, and work, thereby improving the past situation of "sports for sports' sake," where sports were limited to a small number of people. At the same time, China's sports organizations have also participated in many international sports activities and have achieved many successes in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. However, our work still lags far behind the needs of the current objective situation, and we must work hard to do this work well. He Long emphasized the important significance of sports. He said that sports are an important part of the New Democratic education. It can not only improve people's health, but also help cultivate people's good qualities such as bravery, perseverance, agility, and discipline. Chairman Mao once called on us to treat sports as a political task, which means that sports should serve to enhance people's physique and serve the country's economic construction and national defense construction. He Long also pointed out that the main policy of sports work in the future is to carry out mass sports activities, and to start with factories, mines, schools, troops, and government organs, and then gradually promote them according to conditions.
    Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Sports Commission, delivered a report on the plan for sports work in 1953 at the meeting, pointing out that the central task of carrying out mass sports activities this year is: to gradually promote gymnastics before and after work in factories and mines; to implement the "Physical Exercise Standards" system in secondary schools and above in a prepared and planned manner; to promote work break exercises in government organs; to focus on piloting the "Preparation for Labor and Defense of the Motherland" sports system in the troops; and to appropriately carry out certain sports exercises among the militiamen in rural areas during the slack season. In order to implement the policy of "carrying out mass sports activities" and the above central tasks, it is also necessary to do a good job in publicity and education, training cadres, and sports competitions. In terms of publicity and education, emphasis should be placed on publicizing the role of sports in improving people's health, enhancing people's physique, and improving work efficiency, introducing the advanced sports experience of the Soviet Union and knowledge of sports physiology and hygiene, in order to mobilize the broad masses of people to participate in physical exercise. In training cadres, short-term sports cadre training classes and short-term training classes for amateur sports activists from factories, mines, troops, and government organs should be organized in a planned manner to gradually change the situation of insufficient sports work cadres. In organizing sports competitions, in the future, emphasis should be placed on carrying out competitions in grassroots units and various single-sport competitions in the city. The number of levels of sports competitions in the entire region and the entire province should be reduced as much as possible, and holidays should be fully utilized to reduce the situation of too much missed work and classes. The report also requested sports commissions at all levels to pay attention to leadership methods, formulate work plans based on local conditions, move forward steadily, and cooperate closely with relevant departments in carrying out their work.
    The representatives attending the meeting combined the sports work situation in various regions and conducted detailed discussions. Everyone unanimously agreed with the 1953 sports work plan made by the Central Sports Commission. The meeting also studied the organization, staffing, and cadre allocation and training of sports commissions in various regions.
    At the end of the discussion, Cai Tingkai, Deputy Director of the Central People's Government Sports Commission, gave instructions. He emphasized that China's sports foundation is relatively weak, and we must strengthen the study of advanced Soviet sports theory and experience, and encouraged everyone to work hard to realize Chairman Mao's call to "develop sports and enhance people's physique," so that China's sports can fully adapt to the needs of China's economic, cultural, and national defense construction.
    Finally, He Long made detailed instructions based on the opinions in everyone's discussion. He said that this meeting was very successful and solved many important problems in sports work. The task of sports workers today is great and arduous. At present, the foundation of sports work in our country is relatively poor, but we must actively and promptly obtain the leadership of the local Party committees and people's governments of the Communist Party of China, as well as the support and assistance of relevant agencies and organizations such as the Youth League and trade unions, work hard, overcome difficulties, and strive to make certain achievements within a certain period of time, so that sports work can gradually develop along with the development of national construction. When talking about the popularization and improvement of sports, He Long pointed out: Popularization and improvement are unified. Only with popularization can there be improvement, and improvement is also for the sake of popularization. While we are vigorously carrying out the popularization of sports, we must also pay attention to the training of athletes. Training athletes can certainly participate in international sports competitions to enhance friendship and unity among people of all countries, and it is also to prepare cadres and create conditions for the popularization of sports, and it is by no means purely for improvement. Every athlete should become a propagandist, organizer, and instructor of mass sports activities. Therefore, the training of athletes must emphasize political education, overcome conservative viewpoints and purely technical viewpoints, improve athletes' political awareness, organize athletes to strengthen political study, and study Marxism-Leninism. Improve ideological level.
    After the meeting, the Chinese table tennis team that returned from the World Table Tennis Championships gave a wonderful performance to the delegates attending the meeting. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央体育运动委员会
    召开各大行政区体育运动委员会负责人会议
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会四月二十七日到三十日召开了各大行政区体育运动委员会负责人会议。会议中除汇报了各地体育运动的情况外，着重讨论了一九五三年体育工作的计划。
    会议首先由中央人民政府体育运动委员会主任贺龙讲话。他指出解放三年多来，由于共产党和人民政府的正确领导与全体体育工作人员的积极努力，在体育运动方面做了很多的工作，体育工作已有了正确的方向和明确的目的。体育运动的普及工作有了很大的开展，而且已开始在改善人民健康状况及为生产、学习和工作服务方面收到了一定的效果，从而改善了过去“为体育而体育”，体育运动只限于少数人范围之内的情况。同时，我国的体育组织还参加了多次的国际体育活动，并在学习苏联先进经验方面获得不少的成绩。但是，我们的工作还远远落后于目前客观形势的需要，必须大大努力来做好这件工作。贺龙着重讲述了体育事业的重要意义。他说，体育运动是新民主主义教育的重要组成部分。它不仅可以增进人民的健康，而且可以帮助培养人民的勇敢、坚毅、机敏、纪律性等优良品质。毛主席曾号召我们把体育事业当作一项政治任务去对待，这就是说要使体育运动为增强人民体质，为国家的经济建设和国防建设而服务。贺龙并指出今后体育工作的主要方针是开展群众性的体育运动，并且要首先在厂矿、学校、部队、机关中普遍地开展起来，然后再依照条件逐步推广。
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠在会上作了一九五三年体育运动工作计划的报告，指出今年开展群众性体育运动的中心任务是：在厂矿中逐步推行劳动前后的体操；在中等以上学校中有准备有计划地实行“体育锻炼标准”制度；在机关中推行工间体操；在部队中重点试行“准备劳动与保卫祖国”体育制度；在农村的民兵中，利用农闲时节，适当地开展一定项目的体育锻炼。为了贯彻“开展群众性体育运动”的方针和上述中心任务，还必须作好宣传教育、训练干部、运动竞赛等工作。在宣传教育工作方面，应着重宣传体育运动对改善人民健康状况，增强人民体质和提高工作效率的作用，介绍苏联的先进体育经验和运动生理卫生知识，以动员广大人民参加体育锻炼。在训练干部工作中，应有计划地多开办短期体育干部训练班和各厂矿、部队、机关的业余体育积极分子短期训练班，逐渐改变体育工作干部不足的情况。在组织运动竞赛工作中，今后应以开展基层单位竞赛和全市的各单项运动竞赛为主，全区和全省的运动竞赛应尽量减少层次，并应充分利用假期，以减少误工误课太多的情况。报告中并要求各级体育运动委员会注意领导方法，根据各地实际情况制订工作计划，稳步前进，与有关部门密切配合进行工作。
    参加会议的代表结合各地体育工作情况，进行了详细的讨论，大家一致同意中央体育运动委员会所作的一九五三年体育运动工作计划。会议对各地体育运动委员会的组织、编制和干部配备、培养等问题也进行了研究。
    讨论结束时，中央人民政府体育运动委员会副主任蔡廷锴作了指示，他着重指出我国体育基础较差，必须加强学习先进的苏联体育理论和经验，并勉励大家努力实现毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的号召，使我国的体育运动能够完全适应我国经济、文化和国防建设的需要。
    最后，贺龙根据大家讨论中的意见，作了详尽的指示。他说这次会议开得很好，解决了很多体育工作中的重要问题。体育工作者今天的任务是重大而艰巨的，目前我国体育工作的基础是较差的，但我们必须积极地、及时地取得各地中共党委和人民政府的领导，以及青年团、工会等有关机关团体的支持和协助，努力工作，克服困难，争取在一定时期内做出一定成绩来，使体育工作随着国家建设事业的发展而逐步地发展起来。贺龙在谈到体育运动的普及和提高时指出：普及和提高是统一的，有普及才能提高，提高也是为了普及。我们在大力进行体育运动的普及工作的同时，还要注意对运动员的训练工作。训练运动员一方面固然可以参加国际体育竞赛，以增强各国人民间的友谊和团结，一方面也是为普及体育运动准备干部，创造条件，决不是单纯为提高而提高。每一个运动员都应当成为群众性体育运动的宣传员、组织员和指导员。因此，训练运动员必须强调政治教育，克服保守观点和单纯技术观点，提高运动员的政治觉悟，组织运动员们加强政治学习，学习马克思、列宁主义。提高思想水平。
    会议结束后，出席世界乒乓球锦标赛返国的我国乒乓球代表队向与会代表作了精彩的表演。 （新华社）
