Reader's Letters Summary

    Li Chaofeng of the Yanshan County Cultural Center, Hebei Province, writes: I wrote a critical piece entitled “The Yanshan County People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education Has an Erroneous Tendency to Value Education Over Culture,” intending to submit it to the People’s Daily. To double-check the facts and solicit some opinions, I gave the completed manuscript to the head of the Bureau of Culture and Education. Soon after, my manuscript was discussed at an enlarged meeting of the Bureau of Culture and Education. At the meeting, the relevant responsible comrades acknowledged that the opinions I raised in my manuscript were basically correct. However, they also said: “No manuscript can be sent out without the consent of the Party Committee and the person being criticized. Otherwise, it is a serious breach of organization and discipline. Fortunately, you haven’t sent it out yet!” Since then, not only have the issues I raised not been resolved, but Ma, the Deputy Section Chief of the Bureau of Culture and Education, also said: “Hmph! He (referring to me) wants to show off his lofty theories!” Some comrades believe that my writing the manuscript was “immature” and “antagonistic towards the higher authorities,” and so on. I believe that the attitude of Ma, the Deputy Section Chief of the Yanshan County People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, and others, towards criticism is erroneous, and I hope they will earnestly examine and correct it.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    盐山县文教科马副科长等应纠正对待批评的错误态度
    河北省盐山县文化馆李超峰来信：我写了一篇
    “盐山县人民政府文教科有重教轻文的错误倾向”的批评稿，准备投给人民日报。为了再对证一下事实，并征求一些意见，所以我把写好的稿子交给文教科科长。不久，在一次文教科的科务扩大会上讨论我那稿子。会上，我在稿子里所提到的意见，有关负责同志承认基本上是正确的。但同时他们又说：“无论什么稿子，不经党委和被批评者同意，是不能发走的。否则，是严重的无组织无纪律。幸亏你还没有发走！”这以后，不但我所提到的问题并未解决，而且文教科马副科长还说：“哼！显他（指我）的理论高！”有的同志则认为我写稿是“幼稚”，“和上级对抗”等等。我认为，盐山县人民政府文教科马副科长等人对待批评的态度是错误的，希望他们切实检查纠正。
