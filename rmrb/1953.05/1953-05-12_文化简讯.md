    Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government Holds Training Class for Health Administration Cadres
    The training class for health administration cadres, organized by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on May 4th.
    The health administration cadre training class is divided into four groups: medical prevention, maternal and child health, health supervision, and medical education. The study period is three months, including two months of theoretical study and one month of practical training. Two-thirds of the study time is spent on common required courses, such as politics, health policies and regulations, preventive medicine, health statistics, propaganda and education, health supervision, business plans, and financial plans. One-third of the time is spent on professional courses specific to each group. For example, the medical prevention class will focus on "basic hospital construction and management," "health grassroots organizations and tasks at all levels," "publicly funded medical prevention issues," and "how to eliminate medical malpractice issues," etc. In addition to Soviet experts, heads and experts from all levels of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government will teach the training class. Cadres have also been transferred from Tongji Medical College in Central South, Shanghai First Medical College, Beijing Medical College, Shandong University Medical College, and the Department of Public Health of Shanxi University Medical College to assist in the teaching work. The training class officially began on May 5th.
    Gansu Medical Personnel Go Deep into Pastoral Areas to Treat Venereal Diseases and Vaccinate Against Smallpox for Tibetan People
    The Third Gansu Provincial Ethnic Medical Team and the medical team of the Health Institute of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region are going deep into pastoral areas to provide free treatment for venereal diseases and smallpox vaccination for the Tibetan people. They are carrying a large number of medicines and instruments for treating venereal diseases, as well as obstetrical equipment for local midwives. Since arriving in the autonomous region in June last year, the Third Medical Team has conducted health education for the herdsmen, given physical examinations to more than 15,000 people, and cured more than 2,000 venereal disease patients. Many Tibetan women who had been unable to conceive for many years are now pregnant. Because the herdsmen in the autonomous region live very scattered, the medical team has organized the existing primary health personnel in the area and trained a group of vaccinators to go deep into the herdsmen's tents or homes to vaccinate, so as not to affect production. They will also reorganize and establish grassroots health organizations in pastoral areas and widely promote patriotic health campaigns. Now, the herdsmen are actively formulating health covenants, and many young men and women are voluntarily participating in short-term primary health personnel training classes.
    A Modern Leprosarium Is Being Built on the Grasslands of Qinghai
    A leprosarium is currently being built on the grasslands of the Tongren Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province. The hospital covers an area of more than 40 mu, including inpatient wards and outpatient departments, with more than 120 rooms in total, of which more than 80 were completed last winter. All these houses are built with bricks, tiles, and lime, and the rooms have large glass windows, with plenty of air and sunlight. Most of the hospital's medical equipment is ready, and it will be able to accommodate patients after the construction is completed. Before liberation, leprosy was prevalent in pastoral areas such as Tongren and Jianzha in Qinghai Province. The Ma Bufang bandit gang not only did not treat leprosy patients, but also adopted brutal methods such as mass shootings and live burials. Leprosy patients were forced to flee everywhere, which led to the further spread of leprosy. After liberation, in order to alleviate the suffering of the Tibetan people, the provincial people's government sent two medical teams to Tongren and other places for treatment in 1950. The Central People's Government has successively allocated more than 2 billion yuan to build this leprosarium.
    First Music Training Class in Xinjiang Graduates
    The first music training class held by the Cultural Affairs Administration of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, lasting four months, graduated on May 3rd. People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, men, women, old and young, love to sing and dance, but they do not know musical notation. The songs that have been passed down rely entirely on oral instruction, and there are no musical scores recorded, which has led to the loss of many valuable folk music. For example, only a few elderly folk artists in the entire Xinjiang region can still perform the Twelve Mukam classical music pieces by memorization. Therefore, in order to ensure that folk music is well developed, it is necessary to solve the problem of literacy first. A total of 53 people, including members of eight ethnic groups such as Uyghur, Kazakh, and Solon, received this short-term music training, including more than a dozen workers and farmers. Their grades are all excellent, and they can read and sing more complex numbered musical notation songs; most of the students can record simple musical scores, and some can record more complex musical scores.

    中央人民政府卫生部举办卫生行政干部训练班
    中央人民政府卫生部举办的卫生行政干部训练班五月四日在北京开学。
    卫生行政干部训练班，分为医疗预防、妇幼卫生、卫生监督和医学教育四班。学习时间为三个月，包括理论学习两个月，参观实习一个月。其中以三分之二的学习时间学习共同必修课，如政治、卫生政策法令、预防医学、卫生统计、宣传教育、卫生监督、事业计划和财务计划等。三分之一的学习时间分班上专业课程，如医疗预防班将着重讲授“医院基本建设与管理问题”、“各级卫生基层组织及任务”、“公费医疗预防问题”和“如何消灭医疗事故问题”等。担任训练班教课的除苏联专家外，有中央人民政府卫生部的各级首长和专家，并已从中南同济医学院、上海第一医学院、北京医学院、山东大学医学院及山西大学医学院公共卫生系，分别抽调干部担任辅导工作。从五月五日起，训练班已开始正式授课。
    甘肃医务人员深入牧区为藏民治性病种牛痘
    甘肃省民族医疗第三队和天祝藏族自治区人民政府卫生院的医疗组，正深入牧区为藏族人民免费治疗性病和种牛痘。他们携带了大批治疗性病的药品、器械以及供给当地牧民接生员用的接生器械。医疗第三队自去年六月到达自治区后，曾向牧民进行卫生教育，给一万五千多人作体格检查，治愈了二千多名性病患者，很多多年不能生育的藏族妇女现在已经怀了孕。自治区的牧民居住得很分散，医疗组便组织了当地已有的初级卫生人员，并且训练出一批种痘员，深入到牧民帐篷或家里去种痘，以免牧民接种牛痘影响生产。他们并将整顿和建立牧区的基层卫生组织，广泛进行爱国卫生运动的宣传。现在，牧民们正纷纷订立卫生公约，许多青年男女自动参加短期初级卫生人员训练班学习。
    青海草滩上正建立一座现代化的麻疯病院
    青海省同仁藏族自治区的草滩上，现在正建立一座麻疯病院。这座病院的面积约四十多亩，包括病房和门诊两部分，共有房屋一百二十多间，其中八十多间已在去年冬季完工。这些房屋全部用砖瓦、石灰砌成，室内有宽大的玻璃窗户，空气和阳光非常充足。病院的医疗设备大部已准备就绪，建筑完工后便可收容病人。青海省同仁、尖扎等牧区，解放前流行麻疯病，马步芳匪帮对麻疯病人不但不给予治疗，还采取野蛮的集体枪杀和活埋等残酷手段来对待。麻疯病人被迫四处逃亡，以致麻疯病更加蔓延。解放以后，省人民政府为了解除藏族人民的痛苦，在一九五零年派出两个医疗工作组，深入同仁等地进行治疗；中央人民政府曾先后拨款二十多亿元，修建这所麻疯病院。
    新疆首届音乐训练班结业
    新疆省人民政府文化事业管理处举办的首届音乐训练班，历时四个月，已在五月三日结业。新疆各族的男女老幼都喜歌善舞，但他们不识乐谱，已经流传的歌曲全靠口授，没有曲谱记录，致使很多宝贵的民间音乐失传。如十二部玛卡姆古典乐曲，现在全新疆只有几个年老的民间艺人还能靠背诵演奏。因此，要使得民间音乐得到很好的发展，就先要解决识谱问题。受到这次短期音乐训练的共有五十三人，包括维吾尔、哈萨克、索伦等八个民族成份，其中有十多个工人和农民。他们的成绩都很优良，能够识谱并能唱较复杂的简谱歌曲；绝大部分学员可记录简单的曲谱，有些并可记录较复杂的曲谱。
