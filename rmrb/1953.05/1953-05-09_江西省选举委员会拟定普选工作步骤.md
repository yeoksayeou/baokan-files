    The county (city) level election committees of Jiangxi Province have all been established and are actively carrying out various preparations for universal suffrage. On April 24, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government convened the fourth provincial civil affairs work conference. Participants included cadres from provincial-level political and legal departments, as well as civil affairs section (bureau) chiefs and district civil affairs assistants from various prefectures and counties (cities), totaling over 900 people. During the meeting, various documents and issues related to the election work were studied and discussed, enabling cadres to understand the great significance, policies, and practices of universal suffrage work. This meeting also served as a training session for cadres and was the first action taken by Jiangxi Province in preparation for universal suffrage work.
    The universal suffrage work in Jiangxi Province has been specifically planned by the Jiangxi Provincial Election Committee, which stipulates that May to early June will be the preparation time for the work. During this period, cadres participating in the election work will be trained, and a meeting of the chairmen of the election committees of all counties and cities in the province will be held in mid-May to formulate the election work plan for Jiangxi Province. Each county (city) election committee shall formulate a county (city) election work plan in May, and determine the number of representatives in each basic-level congress and the list of members of the basic-level election committee. After the meeting of the heads of civil affairs sections (bureaus) and district civil affairs assistants of special districts, counties, and cities, each county and city will conduct cadre training from May 20 to June 5. Cadres at all levels and members of the Consultative Committee (Standing Committee) throughout the province will also study relevant documents on universal suffrage in May. During the study, responsible comrades from Party and government at all levels will give reports, organize discussions, and provide answers by responsible comrades. At the same time, towns and cities will begin to publicize the election law and study documents through various organizations. Because the countryside is currently busy with spring plowing, publicity work must be carried out in an organized manner using various propaganda tools before the election. The content of the publicity should be simple and clear, focusing on explaining: Why is it necessary to conduct universal suffrage and convene people's congresses? Who has the right to vote and be elected? What kind of people should be elected as representatives?
    June 10 to July 20 is the interval between spring plowing and harvesting. During this period, the first batch of township elections will be conducted, completing 30% to 40% of the townships in the province, that is, 3,000 to 4,000 townships. From late August to early October, all township elections will be completed. The elections in towns such as Ji'an and Linchuan will be completed within the first phase of township elections; the elections in Jingdezhen, Ganzhou, Shangrao, Jiujiang, and the districts under the jurisdiction of Nanchang City will be completed before October.
    Basic-level election work is the foundation of the election work of the county (city) and provincial people's congresses, and even the National People's Congress. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Election Committee has decided to focus on basic-level election work, requiring each special district to strengthen its forces to the counties. The focus of leadership in each county (city) will shift to guiding township elections starting in June. Before June 10, election committees will be established in the first phase of townships and towns to conduct universal suffrage, and at the same time, the election work team will arrive in the first phase of townships and towns to lead the election work. The quality of basic-level election work is closely related to the quality of population and voter registration work. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Election Committee stipulates that the first stage of basic-level elections should focus on publicity and population and voter registration work. Before registration, it is necessary to widely publicize the election law and registration methods. Then, each household will send one person to register with the population and voter investigation and registration team. The basic-level election committee will then review the voter qualifications, and finally announce the voter list, while dividing election districts, establishing voter groups, and announcing the date and location of the election meeting. This step will take about half a month. The important work in the second step of universal suffrage work is to determine the candidates for representatives. This step will also take about half a month. The third step in basic-level election work is to convene an election meeting to elect representatives. This step only takes one day. Finally, the people's congress of the basic-level unit will be convened to elect the township people's government and elect representatives to attend the county (city) people's congress.
    The Jiangxi Province's county (city) People's Congress is scheduled to convene in November of this year, and elect the county (city) People's Government Committee and representatives to attend the Provincial People's Congress. The number of representatives to each county (city) People's Congress will be determined before August.
    In order to successfully complete the election work in Jiangxi Province, the province stipulates that all election committees above the district and town level shall establish offices, which shall be composed of personnel drawn from the civil affairs departments of governments at all levels, the Consultative Committee (Standing Committee), finance, statistics, supervision, courts, public security departments, and the United Front Work Department and Propaganda Department of the Party Committee, as well as various people's organizations.

### 江西省选举委员会拟定普选工作步骤

    江西省选举委员会拟定普选工作步骤
    江西全省县（市）级选举委员会均已成立，正积极进行普选的各项准备工作。四月二十四日江西省人民政府召开全省第四次民政工作会议，参加会议的有省级政法各部门干部和各专署、县（市）的民政科（局）长，区民政助理员，共计九百余人。会议中学习和讨论了有关选举工作的各项文件和问题，使干部懂得了普选工作的伟大意义、政策和做法。这次会议也就是训练干部的会议，是江西全省准备普选工作的第一个行动。
    江西省的普选工作，已由江西省选举委员会作了具体的部署，规定五月至六月上旬为普选工作的准备时间。在这段时间里，训练参加普选工作的干部，并在五月中旬召开全省各县、市选举委员会主席会议，拟定江西省选举工作计划。各县（市）选举委员会要在五月份内制定全县（市）选举工作计划，确定各基层代表大会名额和基层选举委员会名单。此次召开专、县、市的民政科（局）长和区民政助理员会议之后，各县、市将于五月二十日至六月五日进行干部训练工作。全省各级干部和协商委员会（常务委员会）也都在五月份内学习有关普选的文件。学习中将由各级党政负责同志做报告，组织讨论并由负责同志进行解答。与此同时，各城镇开始宣传选举法，并通过各种组织进行文件学习。农村中因目前正忙于春耕，宣传工作必须在选举前有组织地利用各种宣传工具来进行。宣传内容力求简单明了，着重说明：为什么要进行普选和召开人民代表大会？什么人有选举权和被选举权？应当选什么样的人当代表？
    六月十日到七月二十日，是春耕与收割中的间隙，在这一期间要进行第一批乡的选举工作，完成全省百分之三十到百分之四十的乡即三千个乡到四千个乡的选举工作。从八月下旬到十月上旬，完成全部乡的选举工作。吉安、临川等镇的选举在第一期乡选时间内完成；景德镇、赣州、上饶、九江和南昌市辖区的选举在十月以前完成。
    基层选举工作是县（市）、省人民代表大会以至全国人民代表大会选举工作的基础，因此，江西省选举委员会决定把工作重点放在基层选举工作上，要求各专区把力量充实到县里去。各县（市）领导的重点自六月起转至指导乡的选举。六月十日前成立第一期进行普选的乡、镇选举委员会，同时选举工作组到达第一期普选的乡镇领导选举工作。基层选举工作的好坏与人口及选民登记工作的好坏有密切关系，因此江西省选举委员会规定基层选举的第一阶段，主要是一面进行宣传，一面进行人口和选民登记工作。在进行登记之前必须广泛宣传选举法和登记方法，然后由各户派一人向人口、选民调查登记组进行登记，再由基层选举委员会审查其选民资格，最后公布选民名单，同时划分选区，成立选民小组，并公布选举大会的日期和地点。这一步工作大约需要半个月的时间。普选工作第二步的重要工作是确定代表候选人。这一步工作也约需半个月的时间。基层选举工作的第三步是召开选举大会选举代表。这一步只需一天的时间。最后即召开本基层单位的人民代表大会，选举乡人民政府，选举出席县（市）人民代表大会的代表。
    江西省各县（市）人民代表大会决定在今年十一月份召开，并选举县（市）人民政府委员会及出席全省人民代表大会的代表。各县（市）人民代表大会代表名额在八月以前确定。
    为了胜利地完成江西全省的选举工作，该省规定区镇以上选举委员会一律成立办公室，由各级人民政府民政部门、协商委员会（常务委员会）、财政、统计、监察、法院、公安等部门及党委统战部、宣传部以及各人民团体抽调人员组成。
