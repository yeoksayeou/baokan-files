Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: TASS Moscow, May 27th: The Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs' communique:

    On the night of April 25th this year, the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs learned that a foreign aircraft of unknown nationality had intruded into Soviet airspace and appeared over the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was determined that agents of foreign intelligence agencies had parachuted from the aforementioned aircraft.

    The Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs took measures and on April 27th discovered and arrested two individuals who identified themselves as Vasily Vasilyevich Vasilchenko and Leonid Nikolaevich Matkovsky.

    The arrested individuals confessed that they were saboteurs sent to the Soviet Union from abroad by American intelligence agencies, tasked with sabotage, acts of terror, and intelligence gathering. The saboteurs confessed that they parachuted into the territory of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on the night of April 25th from an unmarked American four-engine aircraft.

    During interrogation, the saboteurs Vasilchenko and Matkovsky admitted that the names they used were aliases given to them by American intelligence agencies. Vasilchenko's real name was Alexander Vasilyevich Rakhno, and his alias was "Alec"; Matkovsky's real name was Alexander Nikolaevich Markov, and his alias was "Peter."

    Rakhno and Markov confessed that two other saboteurs – American agents "John" and "Dick" – had parachuted with them from the same aircraft.

    Due to measures taken by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, the saboteurs "John" and "Dick" were also found and arrested on the same day. It turned out that "John" was Sergei Iosifovich Gobunov, and "Dick" was Dmitry Nikolaevich Remiga.

    The arrested individuals were carrying weapons, poison (potassium cyanide), four American-made shortwave radio transceivers, radio signals for guiding aircraft, codes, tools for forging Soviet documents, a large amount of Soviet currency, foreign gold coins, and printing plates for printing anti-Soviet leaflets.

    Open parachutes were found at the landing site of the saboteurs.

    The investigation of the arrested saboteurs has determined that, even during the Great Patriotic War, Rakhno, Markov, and Gobunov were active accomplices of the German fascist aggressors. They betrayed Soviet people engaged in patriotic work resisting the fascist aggressors and participated in German punitive expeditions against the partisans.

    For example, the arrested Rakhno betrayed five Soviet patriots who were later executed by the German secret police; the saboteur Markov was a member of the "Black Sea" punitive detachment, and he often participated in the atrocities committed by the German fascist aggressors against Soviet patriots.

    After the defeat of Nazi Germany, Rakhno, Markov, Gobunov, and Remiga fled to West Germany, where they easily found new masters and protectors in the American intelligence agencies.

    Rakhno, Markov, Gobunov, and Remiga, a group of traitors to the motherland with extensive experience in carrying out despicable acts of treason, were hired by American intelligence agencies and sent to a specialized spy and sabotage school established by American intelligence agencies in Bad Wiessee near Munich, Bavaria, for training.

    Under the guidance of American intelligence officers who called themselves "Bill," "Bob," "Cape Town," and "Vladimir," the traitors Rakhno, Markov, Gobunov, and Remiga received comprehensive training in how to organize and conduct terrorist, sabotage, and espionage activities on Soviet territory, and how to use weapons and explosives. They also learned how to use an American radio transceiver specifically designed for espionage.

    During the interrogation of the saboteurs, it was determined that Captain Holard of the American intelligence agencies was one of the "instructors" at the Bad Wiessee American sabotage and terror school. Holard trained the arrested individuals in the use of sabotage and terrorist methods.

    The saboteurs Rakhno, Markov, Gobunov, and Remiga confessed that the American spy and sabotage school in Bad Wiessee was not the only "educational institution" of its kind in West Germany. There were such "schools" in Munich, Frankfurt am Main, Kaufbeuren, and Bad Wörishofen. In all these "schools," American intelligence agencies secretly trained spies, saboteurs, and assassins to send them to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

    In one such "school" in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Major Ronald Otto Bollenbacher of the American intelligence agencies served as the principal, operating under the alias "Hothead Jim." From 1946 to 1947, he was the assistant air and naval attaché of the United States in Moscow.

    The saboteurs Rakhno, Markov, Gobunov, and Remiga stated that after being trained in Bad Wiessee, the American intelligence agencies provided them with forged Soviet passports, false identification numbers, weapons, poison, radio transceivers, codes, and other equipment. On April 23rd this year, they were escorted by the aforementioned American intelligence officer Captain Holard and flown from Munich to Athens Airport in Greece on an American military aircraft.

    At Athens Airport, they met Major Harold Irwin Fidler of the American intelligence agencies. Harold Irwin Fidler had visited the Soviet Union three times in 1951 under the guise of a diplomatic courier for the U.S. State Department.

    On the night of April 25th, the saboteurs put on their parachutes and, under Fidler's instructions, boarded the aforementioned unmarked four-engine American aircraft, which took them to Soviet territory to parachute.

    The arrested saboteurs confessed that the American intelligence agencies had ordered them to try to infiltrate Kiev and Odessa, where they were to first obtain original Soviet documents by any means possible, even by assassinating Soviet people, and replace them with counterfeit documents forged by American intelligence agencies; then settle in the aforementioned cities and use their radio transceivers to establish coded radio contact with American intelligence agencies in West Germany in order to receive further instructions from the American intelligence agencies for conducting terrorist and sabotage activities in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs has completed the investigation of the case of the saboteurs A.V. Rakhno, A.N. Markov, S.I. Gobunov, and D.N. Remiga, and the case of the aforementioned criminals has been transferred to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet

    苏联捕获并枪决美空降特务四名
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：苏联内务部的公报：
    今年四月二十五日的夜晚，苏联内务部获悉，一架国籍不明的外国飞机侵入苏联领空，出现在乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的上空。曾经查明：有外国情报机关的特务由上述飞机跳伞降落。
    苏联内务部采取了措施，在四月二十七日发现并逮捕了两个自称是瓦西里·瓦西里耶维奇·瓦西尔钦柯和列昂尼德·尼古拉耶维奇·马特科夫斯基的降落者。
    被捕的降落者承认他们是由美国情报机关从外国派到苏联来的破坏分子，负有破坏、施用恐怖手段和刺探情报的任务。破坏者供认他们是今年四月二十五日晚上从一架没有标志的美国四引擎飞机上跳伞降落在乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国境内的。
    在讯问中，破坏者瓦西尔钦柯和马特科夫斯基承认他们用的名字是美国情报机关给他们取的化名，“瓦西尔钦柯”的真实姓名是亚历山大·瓦西里耶维奇·拉赫诺，间谍名字是“亚历克”；“马特科夫斯基”的真实姓名是亚历山大·尼古拉耶维奇·玛柯夫，间谍名字是“彼得”。
    拉赫诺和玛柯夫供认，从同一架飞机上和他们一起跳伞降落的还有其他两个破坏分子——美国特务“约翰”和“迪克”。
    由于苏联内务部所采取的措施，破坏分子“约翰”和“迪克”也在同一天被找到并被逮捕了。原来“约翰”就是谢尔盖·约齐西莫维奇·戈布诺夫，“迪克”就是德米特里·尼古拉耶维奇·列米加。
    被捕的降落者随身携有武器、毒药（氰化钾），四台美制短波无线电收发报机、引导飞机的无线电信号、密码、伪造苏联文件的用具、大量苏联货币、外国黄金硬币，为印刷反苏传单的铅版。
    在破坏分子着陆的地方找到了张开的降落伞。
    由对被捕的破坏分子进行的侦讯已经确定：远在伟大的卫国战争中，拉赫诺、玛柯夫和戈布诺夫就是德国法西斯侵略者的积极同谋，他们出卖从事抵抗法西斯侵略者的爱国工作的苏联人民并参加对付游击队的德国讨伐队的工作。
    例如，被捕的拉赫诺就曾出卖过五个苏联爱国者，他们后来被德国秘密警察枪决了；破坏分子玛柯夫是“黑海”讨伐队的队员，他时常参加德国法西斯侵略者对苏联爱国者所施的暴行。
    纳粹德国溃败后，拉赫诺、玛柯夫、戈布诺夫和列米加逃到西德，他们在那里的美国情报机关中很容易地就找到了新的主子和保护人。
    拉赫诺、玛柯夫、戈布诺夫和列米加这批富有进行卑鄙的卖国工作经验的祖国叛徒被美国情报机关雇用后，就被送往美国情报机关在巴伐利亚慕尼黑附近的巴德维塞设立的一所专门的间谍和破坏学校受训。
    在自称为“毕尔”、“鲍布”、“开普敦”、“弗拉吉米尔”的美国情报官员的指导下，叛徒拉赫诺、玛柯夫、戈布诺夫和列米加受到了如何在苏联领土上组织和进行恐怖、破坏与间谍活动，如何使用武器和炸药等多方面的训练。他们还学了如何使用一种专门为做间谍工作而设计的美国无线电收发报机。
    在对破坏者进行侦讯当中已经确定：美国情报机关的霍拉德上尉是巴德维塞美国破坏和恐怖学校的“教官”之一。霍拉德训练这些被捕的降落者如何使用破坏和恐怖方法。
    破坏分子拉赫诺、玛柯夫、戈布诺夫和列米加供认，巴德维塞的美国间谍和破坏学校在西德还不是仅有的这一类的“教育机关”。慕尼黑、美因河上的法兰克福、考弗贝伦和巴德沃里斯霍夫都设有这种“学校”。美国情报机关在所有这些“学校”中秘密训练间谍、破坏分子和暗杀者，以便把他们派往苏联和各人民民主国家。
    在巴伐利亚考弗贝伦的一所这种“学校”里，由美国情报机关的罗纳德·奥托·波伦巴赫少校担任校长，他用“急性子吉姆”的化名进行活动。从一九四六年到一九四七年，他是美国驻莫斯科的助理空军和海军武官。
    破坏者拉赫诺、玛柯夫、戈布诺夫和列米加供称：他们在巴德维塞受了训练以后，就由美国情报机关供给了他们伪造的苏联护照、假番号、武器、毒药、无线电收发报机、密码以及其他装备。今年四月二十三日，他们在上述的美国情报机关官员霍拉德上尉的护送下，乘美国军用飞机从慕尼黑飞到希腊的雅典机场降落。
    在雅典机场，他们会见了美国情报机关的哈罗德·欧文·菲德勒少校。哈罗德·欧文·菲德勒在一九五一年曾披着美国国务院外交信使的外衣三度来到苏联。
    在四月二十五日晚上，这些破坏者背上了降落伞并在菲德勒的指示下登上了上述没有标志的四引擎美国飞机，这架飞机把他们送到苏联领土的上空跳伞降落。
    被捕的破坏者们供认，美国情报机关曾命令他们设法混进基辅和敖德萨，在那里首先用一切办法甚至于用暗杀苏联人民的办法来弄到苏联文件的原本，代以美国情报机构所伪造的假文件；然后定居在上述城市，用他们的无线电收发报机来和在西德的美国情报机关建立用密码的无线电联系，以便收到美国情报机关对他们在苏联进行恐怖和破坏活动的进一步的指示。
    苏联内务部对于破坏者亚·瓦·拉赫诺、亚·尼·玛柯夫、谢·约·戈布诺夫和德·尼·列米加案件的侦讯工作已经完毕，上述罪犯的案件已移交给苏联最高法院军事委员会。
    几天以前，苏联最高法院军事委员会审讯了亚历山大·瓦西里耶维奇·拉赫诺、亚历山大·尼古拉耶维奇·玛柯夫、谢尔盖·约齐西莫维奇·戈布诺夫和德米特里·尼古拉耶维奇·列米加的案件，认为他们对于苏维埃国家的罪行是严重的，并根据苏联最高苏维埃主席团一九五零年一月十二日颁布的“关于对祖国叛徒、间谍和蓄意破坏者施用死刑”的法令判处他们死刑——枪决。
    判决已经执行。
