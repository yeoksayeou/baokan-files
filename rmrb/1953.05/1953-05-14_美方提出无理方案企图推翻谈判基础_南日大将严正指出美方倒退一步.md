Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 13th—The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean-Chinese Delegation issued the following communique on May 13th:

　　Since the resumption of the meeting, our side has made tremendous efforts to seek a prompt solution to the problem and achieve a Korean armistice. Not only did our side put forward a reasonable and practical six-point detailed implementation plan based on the foundation that both parties had already agreed upon on the day of the resumption of the meeting, suggesting that the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated be sent to a neutral country, but also on May 7th, it attempted to adopt the premise insisted upon by the other party of deciding to leave the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated in Korea, and put forward a new eight-point detailed implementation plan.

　　However, the other party, in the four days from May 9th to 12th, has been entangling the meeting in some hypothetical issues and trivial details, making no progress in the negotiations. At the plenary session of the two delegations on May 13th, the other party further attempted to overthrow the current negotiation basis, which both parties had agreed upon before the resumption of the meeting, of transferring the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country. They advocated that all Korean prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated be given so-called "on-the-spot release" in the areas under the control of the other party when the armistice takes effect, and all non-Korean prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, if they have not eliminated the long-term fear accumulated in the other party's prisoner-of-war camps after being temporarily guarded by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for two months, will also be unilaterally dealt with by the other party in the name of "on-the-spot release." At the same time, the other party also put forward various unreasonable restrictions on the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in temporarily guarding and assisting in the repatriation of prisoners of war, as well as the work of the countries to which the prisoners of war originally belonged in explaining to the prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated.

　　General Nam Il solemnly pointed out at the meeting on May 13th that the other party not only did not accept our side's reasonable proposals on April 26th and May 7th to solve the problem, but instead retreated a step from the three suggestions put forward in the other party's letter on April 16th, which is obviously not the attitude that should be taken in negotiations. The other party's unreasonable proposal threatens the future of the entire armistice negotiations, and our side firmly disagrees with the other party's proposal, and requests the other party to reconsider.

　　The two sides are scheduled to continue to hold a plenary session of the two delegations on May 14th.

### 美方提出无理方案企图推翻谈判基础  南日大将严正指出美方倒退一步

    美方提出无理方案企图推翻谈判基础
    南日大将严正指出美方倒退一步
    【新华社开城十三日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月十三日发表公报如下：
    复会以来，我方为求得问题的迅速解决，实现朝鲜停战，作了极大的努力，我方不但于复会的当日，根据双方所已同意的基础，提出了合理和实际的六点具体实施方案，建议将不直接遣返的战俘送到一个中立国去，而且在五月七日，更试图采用了对方所固执坚持决定将不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜的前提，提出了新的八点具体实施方案。
    但对方在五月九日至十二日的四天内，却一直把会议纠缠在一些假设的问题和琐碎的细节问题上，使谈判一无进展。在五月十三日的双方代表团大会上，对方竟进一步企图推翻双方在复会前即已彼此同意的、将不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国的目前谈判基础，主张一切不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘在停战生效时即在对方控制下的地区内，予以所谓“就地释放”，而一切不直接遣返的非朝鲜籍战俘，如在交由中立国看管两个月后，尚未消除其在对方战俘营中所长期积累的疑惧者，也在“就地释放”的名义下由对方片面处理。与此同时，对方并对中立国遣返委员会临时看管和协助遣返战俘的工作，以及战俘原属国家向未被直接遣返的战俘进行解释的工作，提出种种无理的限制。
    南日大将在五月十三日会上严正指出，对方不但没有接受我方四月二十六日和五月七日的合理方案来解决问题，反而从对方四月十六日来信中所提出的三点建议倒退了一步，这显然不是谈判中所应有的态度。对方的无理建议威胁了整个停战谈判的前途，对方方案是我方坚决不能同意的，要求对方重新考虑。
    双方定于五月十四日继续举行双方代表团大会。
