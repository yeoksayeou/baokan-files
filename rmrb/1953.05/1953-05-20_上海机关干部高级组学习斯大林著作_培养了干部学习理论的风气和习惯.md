The Shanghai Municipal Organ Cadres' Theoretical Study Advanced Group, under the direct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, began studying Comrade Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" on April 10th. The Municipal Committee plans to spend thirteen weeks, with six hours of study per week (i.e., Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings), to complete the study of Comrade Stalin's great work. The study method is to focus on problems and engage in self-study and discussion. Currently, most advanced study groups in the city have completed the study of three topics: "Stalin's work 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR' is a New and Outstanding Contribution to Marxist-Leninist Theory," "Stalin on the Objective Nature of Economic Laws," and "The Law that Relations of Production Must Correspond with the Nature of the Productive Forces." Everyone's attitude towards learning is very serious, and they generally delve into the books. Many comrades have written notes. In the study, methods of criticism and self-criticism were also adopted, consolidating study discipline and cultivating a climate and habit of learning among cadres.

A total of 203 organ cadres from the city participated in the advanced group study. These mainly include responsible Party member cadres with basic knowledge of political economy from units such as members of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, various departments of the Municipal Committee, various bureaus of the Municipal Government, municipal-level mass organizations, and the suburban industrial committee. Cadres at the division level with basic knowledge of political economy from Party committee organs and economic work organs were also included as appropriate. They are organized into thirty-two study groups according to their units and systems. The group leaders are the main responsible cadres of each unit, and there is also a study secretary who assists the group leader in their work and maintains contact with the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee.

The specific work of organizing advanced group theoretical study is carried out by the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee based on the decision of the Municipal Committee. In order to strengthen contact with the various groups and help the Municipal Committee grasp the learning situation in a timely manner, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee also formulated a simple "Advanced Group Study Situation Report Form," which was distributed to the study secretaries of each group to fill out and submit after each study session. The tutoring work of the advanced study group is undertaken by the Study Advisory Group approved by the Municipal Committee (a total of eighteen comrades). In addition, the members of the Municipal Committee formed the first study group (i.e., the central group) to promote the learning of the various groups.

On May 13th, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a joint meeting of the advanced study group leaders and study advisors. Participants included all comrades from the Municipal Committee's First Group (Central Group), study advisors, leaders of each study group, and study secretaries, totaling fifty-nine people. The meeting was presided over by Comrade Pan Hannian, First Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee. In addition to exchanging learning experiences, the meeting discussed issues such as learning progress, requirements, and tutoring work, and stipulated some methods for the tutoring work of the Study Advisory Group. Comrade Chen Pixian, Fourth Secretary of the Municipal Committee, gave a speech at the end of the meeting. He pointed out that the advanced study groups had gained something from their studies over the past month. Most comrades consciously abided by the system, studied diligently, and boldly engaged in debates, which showed that the atmosphere of theoretical study within the Party had begun to rise and the habit of learning had begun to develop, but it still needed to be further consolidated. Comrade Chen Pixian asked everyone to be realistic, do what they can, focus on the center, and move forward steadily in future studies, without being impetuous or demanding too much. Regarding the issue of study guidance, he asked the comrades serving on the Study Advisory Group to be bold and responsible, and not necessarily to "advise" on everything; in addition to answering questions, study advisors can also introduce study methods; contact the relevant groups once every week or two, and some questions can even be raised to the First Group (Central Group) for discussion. At the same time, he hoped that the general comrades would not demand too much from the study advisors, expecting them to solve every problem. In terms of learning methods, in addition to emphasizing diligent self-study and bold debate, he also emphasized writing study心得 (xinde - insights or reflections) in groups, focusing on problems.

    上海机关干部高级组学习斯大林著作
    培养了干部学习理论的风气和习惯
    上海市机关干部理论学习高级组，在中共上海市委直接领导下，已从四月十日起开始学习斯大林同志的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。市委计划以十三个星期、每周学习六小时（即每星期三下午和星期六上午），学完斯大林同志这一伟大著作。学习方法是以问题为中心，进行自学与讨论。目前全市各高级学习组已多数学完“斯大林的著作‘苏联社会主义经济问题’是对马克思列宁主义理论的新的卓越的贡献”、“斯大林论经济法则的客观性质”、“生产关系一定要适应生产力性质的法则”等三个题目。大家的学习态度很认真，一般都能钻研书本，很多同志都写了笔记。在学习中还采取了批评与自我批评的办法，巩固了学习纪律，培养了干部学习的风气和习惯。
    这次全市机关干部参加高级组学习的共有二百零三人，主要为中共上海市委的委员、市委各部、市府各局、市级各群众团体、市郊工委等单位中具有政治经济学基本知识的党员负责干部，并酌量吸收了党委机关和经济工作机关中具有政治经济学基本知识的处一级的干部参加。按单位、系统编为三十二个学习小组。小组长由各单位主要负责干部担任，另设学习秘书一人，协助组长进行工作与市委宣传部保持联系。
    组织高级组理论学习的具体工作，由市委宣传部根据市委的决定进行。市委宣传部为了加强与各小组的联系，帮助市委及时掌握学习情况，还制订了一种简单的“高级组学习情况报告表”，分发各组学习秘书，在每次学习后填写上交。高级学习组的辅导工作，由市委批准成立的学习顾问组担任（共十八位同志）。此外，并由市委委员组成第一学习组（即中心组），推动各组的学习。
    五月十三日，中共上海市委召开了高级学习组组长和学习顾问的联席会议，参加的有市委第一组
    （中心组）全体同志、学习顾问、各学习组小组长及学习秘书等共五十九人。会议由市委第一副书记潘汉年同志主持。会上除交流学习经验外，对学习进度、要求、辅导工作等问题进行了讨论，规定了学习顾问组辅导工作的一些办法。会议最后由市委第四书记陈丕显同志讲话。他指出各高级学习组一个月来的学习是有收获的。大部分同志都自觉地遵守制度，认真读书，大胆展开争论，这些都说明了党内理论学习空气开始高涨，学习习惯开始养成，但还须进一步巩固。陈丕显同志要求大家在今后的学习中要实事求是，量力而行，抓住中心，稳步前进，不要急躁与要求过高。关于学习辅导问题，他要求担任学习顾问组的同志要大胆负责，不一定要求样样都“顾问”；学习顾问除了解答问题外，也可以介绍学习方法；每一周或两周与有关小组联系一次，有的问题并可提到第一组（中心组）来讨论。同时，他希望一般同志也不能过高地要求学习顾问什么问题都能解决。在学习方法上他除强调刻苦自修、大胆争论外，并强调以小组为单位、以问题为中心写学习心得。
