    The blazing flames – the signal of the air-drop zone burned on the square near a certain place leading to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. The firelight illuminated the smiling faces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and Tibetan compatriots standing on the square, excitedly gazing eastward, awaiting the arrival of the trial flight.

    Just past noon, a grass-green giant aircraft bearing the "August 1st" military emblem flew steadily and rapidly towards the sky above the firelight from the east. People immediately cheered excitedly: they finally flew over the mountains! Then, packages of food, books, and newspapers slowly descended from the sky.

    The brave men piloting this aircraft were Li Xiangmin, the captain of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force with extensive long-range flight experience, and his team: Hu Mingtao, Liu Yuying, Di Qinfa, Yan Lymin, Luo Xiling, Liu Youzhuang, and Li Ruichen. In order to support the troops entering Tibet and the Tibetan compatriots, they accepted the glorious mission of continuing the trial flight to the Tibetan Plateau and extending the air route westward.

    Twenty days before they carried out this mission, the mechanics of this aircraft had carefully inspected and disassembled every part of the aircraft, even tightening each screw again and again, as if they were dressing up a bride. At their base, the climate was very bad, and the supply of aircraft materials was also difficult. But they finally overcame all difficulties, so that the aircraft stood on the tarmac at the scheduled time, waiting for the signal to set off.

    Others were also making preparations for the expedition nervously. Some prepared parachutes, some checked binoculars, flashlights, signal guns, and air-to-ground liaison mirrors. The cooks were busy baking bread and cooking beef. Ground commanders and political workers, as well as comrades from the aircraft team, were meticulously preparing the trial flight plan.

    On this day, Li Xiangmin and his comrades took off into the cool morning breeze. The aircraft circled the airport twice and then flew straight in a southwest direction. They had only one will: to open up a new air route and resolutely deliver the supplies for the ground forces to the Tibetan Plateau!

    The aircraft flew higher and higher, quickly reaching an altitude of 17,000 feet, breaking through the first wall on the Tibetan Plateau, and flying towards the "Roof of the World."

    A magnificent mountain peak appeared beneath the wing. This is Erlang Mountain! Everyone was moved by a feeling, recalling the heroic deeds of the ground forces who paved the road to Tibet with their own hands and sweat. Then, a rushing river appeared in front of the fuselage, this is the treacherous Dadu River. They remembered that the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had once crossed this natural barrier during the Long March. The image of the heroes and the deeds of the martyrs encouraged Li Xiangmin and his comrades. Their aircraft flew more bravely westward.

    The Bayan Har Mountains, 4,800 meters above sea level, and the world-famous Tanggula Mountains were in sight. Although it was summer, the peaks and cliffs were covered with snow. At this time, layers of cirrus clouds obscured their vision, and the high-altitude airflow buffeted the aircraft up and down. They skillfully used their past experience of blind flying, carefully passed through the clouds, and flew over these two mountain peaks. However, at this time, the flight route direction was different from the navigation chart they carried, and the radio signal to communicate with the ground commander was so weak that it could hardly be heard. All they could see in front of them was snowy mountain after snowy mountain, and it was even more difficult to continue flying forward. At this time, Li Xiangmin thought to himself: In order for the ground forces to receive supplies, in order to build a new Tibet, can we bow our heads in the face of difficulties? No, we must open up this new air route! So he wrote a few words to tell everyone: Resolutely overcome difficulties and fly to the destination! Everyone's determination became even firmer.

    The aircraft continued to fly west, and the airflow became more and more severe. Gale winds mixed with snowflakes hit the fuselage, and the temperature was already minus thirty degrees Celsius. Everyone's work became even more tense. Navigator Yan Lymin carefully observed the ground and drew the flown route on the map one by one; at the same time, he accurately used his hands to instruct the pilot on the flight direction. They said: No matter how high the mountain is, no matter how bad the airflow is, it can't stop our determination to fly.

    After noon, the aircraft flew into a passage between two large mountains. A thin yellow ribbon wound through the mountains, and the shadows of cattle herds could be vaguely seen, this is the yak. Everyone's heart blossomed with joy. Rich plateau flying experience told them that where there is yak activity, there will be towns, and judging from the estimated time, the distance to the destination would not be too far. Soon, they suddenly found a few wisps of smoke rising from a flat ground in the distance, and everyone shouted wildly: the destination has arrived! The aircraft dropped supplies towards the location indicated by the red "T" cloth on the snow. A new air route was finally opened up under the efforts of the brave men. The aircraft circled the air-drop zone a few times, then waggled its wings and flew high back.

    A month later, Li Xiangmin and his comrades received a letter from the ground brothers' unit at the air-drop location, which read: "We have eaten the food you dropped, and read the books and newspapers that publish news of the motherland's construction and new victories in all aspects. Thank you for your support. Let us work together in different positions to defend the motherland's borders and build a beautiful and happy new Tibet."

    康藏高原上一条新航线的开辟
    许钊群
    熊熊的火焰——空投场的信号在通往西藏首府拉萨的某地附近的广场上燃烧着，火光照耀着站在广场上的中国人民解放军战士和藏族同胞们的笑脸，他们兴奋地向东方眺望着试航飞机的到来。
    天刚过午，一架有“八一”军徽的草绿色巨型飞机，从东方稳重而迅速地向火光上空飞翔过来。人们立时兴奋地欢呼起来：他们到底越过重山峻岭飞来了！接着，一包包的食品、书籍和报纸从半空徐徐降下来了。
    掌握这架飞机的勇士，便是中国人民解放军空军某部具有多次远航经验的机长李向民和他率领下的胡明涛、刘育英、狄勤法、阎履敏、罗锡令、刘有庄和李爃琛。他们为了支援进藏部队和康藏同胞，接受了继续向康藏高原试航，把航线向西伸展的光荣任务。
    早在他们执行这次任务二十天以前，这架飞机的机械师们就像打扮一个出嫁姑娘似地，仔细地检修和拆洗了机身上每一个零件，甚至连一颗螺丝钉也扭了再扭。在他们工作的基地，气候很不好，飞机器材供应也很困难。但他们终于克服了一切困难，使这架飞机在预定的时刻伫立在停机线上，等待出征的讯号。
    另外一些人，也在紧张地做着出征的准备工作。有的准备保险伞、有的检查着望远镜、手电筒、讯号枪、陆空联络镜。炊事员忙着烤面包、烧牛肉。地面指挥员和政治工作者以及飞机小组的同志们，周密地赶制着试航方案。
    这一天，李向民和他的战友们迎着清晨的凉风起飞了。飞机在机场上空绕了两个圈子后就直向西南方向飞去。他们的意志只有一个：开辟新航线，坚决把供应地面部队的物资送到康藏高原去！
    飞机越飞越高，很快就飞到一万七千呎的高空，突破了康藏高原上的第一道围墙，向着“世界屋脊”飞去。
    一座绮丽的山峰出现在机翼下面。这就是二郎山啊！每一个人都为一种感情激动着，追忆起英雄的地面部队用他们的双手和血汗，铺平了入藏道路的英雄事迹。接着，机身的前方又出现一条湍急的河流，这是天险大渡河。他们记得当年中国工农红军长征时曾抢渡过这条天险的河流。英雄们的形象和先烈们的事迹，鼓舞着李向民和他的战友。他们的飞机更加勇敢地向西飞去。
    拔海四千八百公尺的巴颜喀拉山和举世闻名的唐古拉山就在眼前了。虽然是夏天，山峰、悬崖上却堆着白雪。这时，层层卷云遮住了他们的视线，高空的气流把飞机打得上下颠簸着。他们熟练地运用往日盲目飞行的经验，小心翼翼地穿过乌云，飞过了这两座山峰。可是，这时飞行的航线方向已经和携带的航行图不一样了，和地面指挥员联络的无线电声音也微小得几乎听不见了，眼前唯一可以看到的是雪山接着雪山，继续向前飞更加困难了。这时，李向民心里想：为了使地面部队得到物资供应，为了建设新康藏，我们能在困难面前低头吗？不能，我们一定要开辟出这条新航线！于是他写了几个字告诉大家：坚决克服困难，飞到目的地去！大家的决心也随着更加坚定起来。
    飞机继续向西飞，气流越加恶劣。急风夹着雪花打在机身上，气温已是零下三十度了。大家的工作更加紧张起来。领航员阎履敏在细心地观察着地面，把飞过的航线一条条地画在地图上；同时，他还精确地用手给驾驶员指示飞行方向。他们说：那怕你山再高，气流再坏，也挡不住我们飞行的决心。
    天过中午，飞机飞进两座大山的夹道。万山丛中绕着一条纤细的黄色带子，隐约地看见牛群活动的影子，这就是牦牛。大家心里欢喜得开了花。丰富的高原飞行经验使他们知道：有了牦牛群的活动，就会有城镇，从预计的时间来判别，距离目的地也不会太远了。不久，他们突然发现在远远的一块平地上升起了几缕青烟，大家狂欢地喊起来：目的地到了！飞机朝着雪地上红色“丁”字布指示的地点投下了物资。一条新航线终于在勇士们的努力下开辟成功了。飞机绕着空投场飞了几圈，然后摇一摇翅膀，又高飞返航了。
    一个月以后，李向民和他的战友，接到一封来自空投地点的地面兄弟部队的信，信上写着：“我们吃到了你们投下来的食品，读到了刊载祖国建设和各方面取得新的胜利的消息的书报。谢谢你们对我们的支援。让我们在不同的工作岗位上共同努力，保卫祖国边疆，建设美丽幸福的新康藏。”
