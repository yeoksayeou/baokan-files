    American People Demand an End to the Korean War

    I.
    Recently, the new efforts made by the Chinese, Korean, and Soviet people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and safeguard world peace have aroused enthusiastic responses among the American people. They have successively demanded that the U.S. government immediately stop the Korean War and consult with major powers to resolve international disputes. At the peace conference held by the American "Peace Crusade" in Chicago in late March, it was decided to launch another nationwide movement, demanding that the U.S. Congress immediately cease fire in Korea, and that local peace organizations urge local legislatures to pass peace bills. According to an Associated Press report on April 14, U.S. Republican Congressman Judd also "predicted" that "millions of American mothers" would rise up to demand that the Eisenhower government accept the peace proposals of the Chinese and Korean people.

    The actions of the American people demanding an end to the Korean War are concentratedly manifested in the rapid development of the domestic peace movement in the United States. Despite the U.S. government's displeasure, the American people have established more than three thousand organizations for peace. They have launched various activities with stopping the war as their primary demand. Last year, the American "Peace Crusade" launched a movement among the American people to write one million letters to Truman demanding an immediate end to the Korean War. In many cities such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, American peace activists, regardless of police persecution, have continuously held various mass rallies, street speeches, and signature collections, and have received support from the broad masses of the American people everywhere. American peace organizations, progressive newspapers, progressive labor unions, and leaders and celebrities from all walks of life have continuously demanded an immediate end to the Korean War through actions such as issuing declarations, passing peace resolutions, and sending representatives to visit the U.S. government, Congress, and the United Nations. These scattered activities are gaining momentum and are gradually moving towards united struggle. In early April last year, 750 representatives from all walks of life from sixteen U.S. states held a National Peace Congress in Washington. The first resolution passed by the congress was to call on the people of the whole country to support the realization of peace in Korea. Last September, because the U.S. government prevented many representatives of the American people from attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, the American people held a grand "New York-Beijing Peace Rally" at home when the conference was held. In October last year, at a peace conference held in Springfield, Illinois, an ordinary woman launched a "Save Our Sons" movement. This movement quickly spread to all parts of the United States. By March of this year, seventeen states had established "Save Our Sons" committees, and thousands of people had written letters to Eisenhower, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War.

    The American people's demands are put forward from various perspectives and in various ways. In a society like the United States, it is very difficult for people to express their true opinions. However, something that shocked the whole country happened in the United States last year: a builder in Arkansas, after learning that his son had been captured in Korea, wrote to many parents of American prisoners of war, urging them to collect signatures demanding an end to the Korean War. This completely spontaneous movement collected nearly one million signatures in just a few weeks. This fully reflects that a rapid end to the Korean War is the common demand of the American people. Recently, another incident occurred in the United States that surprised the U.S. government: in Philadelphia, twelve American citizens jointly announced that they refused to pay federal income tax to protest the U.S. government's use of the people's money to conduct the Korean War and prepare for new wars. This shows that the American people's actions to demand an end to the Korean War are becoming more and more determined.
    II.
    The Korean War launched by the United States not only caused unprecedented disasters to the Korean people and hindered peace in the Far East and the world, but it also brought serious disasters to the American people. Therefore, it is only natural that the American people, proceeding from their own vital interests, have demanded an end to this war.

    What has attracted the most attention of the broad strata of the American people is the huge casualties of American soldiers. To date, the Korean War has become the foreign war with the largest number of deaths and injuries in American history, second only to World War II. Millions of American families are worried every day that bad news will come knocking on their doors, and they could have lived a peaceful life of family reunion. The serious impact of the increasing number of American military deaths and injuries among the American people cannot even be concealed by the propaganda machine of the American ruling class sometimes. The Associated Press wrote on August 2 last year: "This war thousands of miles away is costing more lives and affecting more American families month by month. ... Ordinary people are asking themselves: 'Why are we fighting in Korea?' He may find it difficult to find an answer." The "Washington Star" also wrote on October 18 last year: "All women hate wars in Korea or elsewhere, and many mothers will seize any promise to oppose sending their sons to war."

    According to the news revealed in the American newspapers and periodicals, the American people have taken various ways to oppose sending their sons into the Korean War. The most common method is passive evasion. According to official U.S. figures, incidents of American people violating the draft law have increased nearly eightfold after the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea. And parents who can afford to send their children to college send their children to college to evade military service. The number of American youths who are drafted into the camp and escape being sent to the Korean battlefield reaches as many as 20,000 per month, which is about half of the number of soldiers recruited by the United States in the second half of last year.

    At the same time, the movement to take active action to demand an end to the Korean War to save the lives of American youth has also been widely launched in the United States.
    III.
    If the war casualties and war mobilization directly affect relatively few American families, then the economic impact of the war affects all of the more than 50 million American families. In the first two years of the U.S. government's war of aggression against Korea, the direct war expenses spent in Korea reached 20 billion U.S. dollars; and the military expenses paid to maintain this war and intensify arms expansion and war preparations are even more astonishing. According to the U.S. government's appropriations and budget figures, the U.S. military expenditure totaled 250 billion U.S. dollars in the four fiscal years from July 1950 to June 1954. This amount is almost equal to the total amount of U.S. federal government revenue in the 157 years from the founding of the United States to 1945 (254.2 billion U.S. dollars). The American monopoly capitalists have obtained huge profits in these years, while the American people have been overwhelmed by the heavy shackles of heavy taxes, high prices, and reduced income. In 1951, the money spent by the American people on food was only 55 billion U.S. dollars, while the money spent on donations and taxes reached 75 billion U.S. dollars. The donations and taxes borne by American workers have increased many times, and the actual wages have decreased by more than 30% compared with 1939. The income of American farmers is also decreasing rapidly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also admits that the income of American farmers in 1950 and 1952 has fallen to the lowest level in ten years. In this way, the broad masses of the American people have to reduce their living standards, and the consumption of clothing, food and accommodation is shrinking. Last year, the average per capita consumption of meat in the United States decreased by 10% compared with 1946, and flour decreased by 14.7%. And the consumption of industrial cotton and textile wool decreased by 12% and 16% in one year. According to the statistics of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine: at the end of last year, the private debt of the United States was more than double that at the end of 1945, and more than 10 million American families owed doctors' debts because they could not afford medical expenses.

    These facts are causing ordinary Americans to think deeply every day. As the American peace representative Mrs. Sernaff said at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference: "When the American people see that the list of their dead in Korea is getting longer and longer day by day, their living standards are constantly declining, and donations and taxes are getting heavier and heavier, when they begin to calculate these costs, they also begin to realize what the policies of our leaders have brought our country (referring to the United States) to." Last winter, the representatives of the New York State Farmers Association Congress declared in the peace resolution they passed: "A national economy built on the basis of war and war preparations can only make civil rights non-existent, and only bring blood and tears, and poverty of the country and the people... We (referring to the United States) have embarked on a crazy road. We should hope for peace instead of war." This is the voice of thousands of ordinary Americans.

    Americans with a little foresight are also worried about the consequences of the U.S. government's war in Korea. A letter from a New York doctor published in the "New York Times" last year is an example. The doctor wrote: "I read in the 'Times' magazine on May 9 the story of how the United Nations Air Force destroyed the ancient city of Soonan with all-day air raids. ... This act of completely destroying a two-square-mile city shocked me extremely. ... In the 1930s, we watched newsreels of Italian fascists bombing the Abyssinians. In the 1940s, we watched newsreels of the Nazis bombing European cities. And now, in the 1950s, we hear that the U.S. Air Force is doing the same thing, how can we pretend to be at peace with ourselves?" He pointed out: "There is no kind person in the United States or the world who does not condemn this kind of thing." He demanded: "Let's end this Korean War!"

    美国人民要求停止朝鲜战争
    李高
    一
    最近，中、朝、苏人民为和平解决朝鲜问题与维护世界和平而作的新的努力，在美国人民中间引起了热烈的反应，他们纷纷向美国政府提出立即停止朝鲜战争，并与各大国协商解决国际间争端的要求。美国“和平十字军”三月下旬在芝加哥举行的和平会议上，决议再发起一次全国性的运动，向美国国会要求立即在朝鲜停火，并由各地的和平组织敦促地方立法机构通过和平法案。据美联社四月十四日报道，美国共和党议员周以德也“预料”，将有“数百万美国母亲”起来要求艾森豪威尔政府接受中、朝人民的和平建议。
    美国人民要求结束朝鲜战争的行动，集中地表现在美国国内和平运动的迅速发展上。尽管美国政府不高兴，美国人民还是建立了三千处以上争取和平的组织。他们以停止战争为首要要求展开了各种活动。去年，美国“和平十字军”在美国人民中曾发动一个写一百万封信向杜鲁门要求立即停止朝鲜战争的运动。在纽约、芝加哥、旧金山等许多城市中，美国的和平战士们不顾警察的迫害，不断地举行各种群众集会、街头讲演和征集签名等活动，到处得到广大美国人民的支持。美国的和平组织、进步报纸、进步工会和各界领袖、著名人士等，不断地以发表宣言，通过和平决议，推派代表访问美国政府、国会和联合国等行动，要求立即停止朝鲜战争。这些分散的活动声势愈来愈大，而且已逐渐走向团结奋斗的道路。去年四月初，来自美国十六个州的七百五十名各界代表在华盛顿举行了全国和平代表大会，大会通过的第一项决议就是号召全国人民支持实现朝鲜和平。去年九月，由于美国政府阻挠许多美国人民的代表出席在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，美国人民就在这个会议召开时在国内举行了盛大的“纽约—北京和平集会”。去年十月间，在伊利诺斯州斯普林腓特城举行的一次和平会议上，一位普通妇女发起了一个“拯救我们的儿子”运动。这个运动很快就发展到美国各地，到今年三月，已有十七个州成立了“拯救我们的儿子”委员会，成千上万的人写信给艾森豪威尔，要求立刻停止朝鲜战争。
    美国人民的这种要求是从各种不同角度出发，以各种方式提出来的。在美国那样的社会里，人民要表达自己真正的意见是很不容易的。可是，去年美国发生了一件轰动全国的事：阿肯色斯州的一个营造商，知道他的儿子在朝鲜被俘以后，就写信给许多美国战俘的父母，敦促他们征集要求停止朝鲜战争的签名。这个完全自发的运动，在短短的几个星期中就征集到了将近一百万个签名。这件事充分地反映出迅速停止朝鲜战争是美国人民的普遍要求。最近，美国又发生了一件使美国政府吃惊的事：在费城有十二个美国公民共同宣布拒绝缴付联邦所得税，以抗议美国政府拿人民的钱去进行朝鲜战争和准备新的战争。这说明美国人民要求结束朝鲜战争的行动是越来越坚定了。二
    美国发动的朝鲜战争不但使朝鲜人民受到空前灾难，妨碍着远东和世界和平，它也给美国人民带来了严重的灾害。因此，美国人民从他们的切身利益出发提出了停止这个战争的要求，是极自然的事。
    最引起美国广大阶层注意的是美国兵员的巨大伤亡。到目前为止，朝鲜战争已成为美国历史上仅次于第二次世界大战的死伤最大的对外战争了。千百万美国家庭每天都担心着不幸的消息会来叩门，而他们本来是尽可以过着家人团聚的和平生活的。美军死伤数字不断增加在美国人民中所引起的严重影响，连美国统治阶级的宣传机器有时也掩饰不了。美联社在去年八月二日写道：“这个万里之外的战争一个月比一个月耗费更多的生命，影响更多的美国家庭。……普通的人们都扪心自问：‘我们究竟为什么在朝鲜作战呢？’他可能很难找到一个回答。”“华盛顿明星报”在去年十月十八日也写道：“所有的女人都痛恨在朝鲜或其他的地方的战争，许多母亲都要抓住任何一种诺言来反对把她们的儿子们投入战争。”
    从美国报刊上透露出来的消息来看，美国人民是采取了多种方式来反对把他们的儿子投入朝鲜战争的。最普遍的办法是消极逃避。据美国官方公布的数字，在侵朝战争发生后，美国人民违反兵役法的事件增加了将近八倍。而有能力让孩子上大学的父母，都把孩子送进大学以逃避兵役。被征入营的美国青年逃避被派往朝鲜战场的每月达两万人之多，大约等于美国去年下半年每月征兵人数的一半。
    与此同时，采取要求停止朝鲜战争的积极行动来挽救美国青年生命的运动，在美国也广泛展开了。三
    如果说战争伤亡和战争动员所直接影响的美国家庭还比较少的话，那末战争的经济影响却波及了所有的五千多万美国家庭。美国政府在侵朝战争的头两年中，直接花在朝鲜的战争费用达两百亿美元；而为维持这个战争并加紧扩军备战所支付的军费更大得惊人。根据美国政府的拨款和预算数字，从一九五○年七月到一九五四年六月的四个财政年度里，美国的军事费用共达二千五百亿美元。这个数目差不多等于美国开国以来到一九四五年止的一百五十七年中美国联邦政府收入的总数（二千五百四十二亿美元）那样多。美国的垄断资本家们在这几年得到了巨额的利润，而美国人民却被重税、物价高涨和收入减少沉重的枷锁压得喘不过气来。一九五一年，美国人民在食物上用的钱只有五百五十亿美元，而用在捐税上的钱达七百五十亿美元。美国工人负担的捐税增加了好多倍，而实际工资比一九三九年降低了百分之三十以上。美国农民的收入也在急遽降低，美国农业部也承认，一九五○年和一九五二年，美国农民的收入都降到了十年来的最低水平。这样，美国广大人民不得不降低他们的生活水准，衣食消耗都在缩减着。去年，平均每个美国人的肉类消耗量比一九四六年降低了百分之十，面粉降低了百分之十四点七。而工业用棉和织物用毛料消耗，一年间就减少了百分之十二和十六。据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志统计：去年年底美国的私人债务比一九四五年底增加了一倍以上，一千多万美国家庭因付不起诊疗费而欠了医生的债。
    这些事实是每天每天地在引起普通的美国人的深思的。正如美国的和平代表塞尔奈夫人在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上所说的：“当美国人民看到他们在朝鲜死亡者的名单一天比一天长，他们的生活水准不断下降，捐税越来越重，当他们开始计算这些代价时，他们也就开始认识到我们的国家（指美国）被我们的领导者的政策弄到什么地步。”去年冬天，纽约州农民协会大会的代表们在他们所通过的和平决议里宣布道：“建立在战争与备战的基础上的国民经济，只能使民权不复存在，只带来血与泪，国家和人民的贫困……我们（指美国）已走上了一条疯狂的道路。我们应当希望和平而不应当希望战争。”这是代表着千千万万美国普通人发出的声音。
    稍有远见的美国人对于美国政府在朝鲜进行战争的后果也是担心的。去年发表在“纽约时报”上的一个纽约医生的来信就是一个例子。这个医生写道：“我在五月九日的‘时代’杂志上读到了联合国空军如何以整天的空袭毁灭遂安古城的故事。……这种完全破坏一个两平方哩的城市的行为使我极为惊骇。……在三十年代里，我们细看过意大利法西斯轰炸阿比西尼亚人的新闻影片。在四十年代里，我们细看过纳粹轰炸欧洲城市的新闻影片。而如今，在五十年代里，我们听到美国空军正在干着同样的事情，怎么可以装得心安理得呢？”他指出：“在美国或者全世界没有一个善良的人不谴责这种事情的。”他要求道：“让我们结束这个朝鲜战争吧！”
