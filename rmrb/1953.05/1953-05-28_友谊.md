Friendship
Wu Shaoqi Gu Lei

(I) Studying Workers

The people of Anshan often誉(yu4 - praise) this city, which bears a historical mission, as the "crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship." This is no accident. The Soviet people designed automated factories for us, manufactured automated equipment, helped build the factories, and taught us how to operate these machines.

On the construction site of New China's first seamless steel tube plant, we saw the flower of this friendship. As this huge factory was about to be completed, the internship group of more than forty workers and technicians, who had been away from their motherland for eight months, returned to their country from the distant Urals, laden with advanced technology! They were all young, full of energy, and a look of excitement often appeared on the corners of their mouths; their notebooks were filled with winding Russian. Regarding the technology of rolling seamless steel tubes – from heating and cutting to piercing, sizing, and calendering… each of them understood one aspect of it. They could not only operate independently but also understood some basic theoretical knowledge. As soon as they arrived at the factory, they got busy, looking at blueprints, participating in test runs, attending seminars, and giving reports. Everyone looked at them with welcome and envy. These people will become the grassroots backbone when the seamless steel tube plant starts production. Their determination is: "When production starts, strive to roll out the first seamless steel tube with the first steel material!"

Eight months ago, they were just ordinary technicians and technical personnel from various factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel. None of them had ever seen such the latest automated equipment for rolling seamless steel tubes. Zhu Weizhi, twenty-two years old, only attended school for three years before entering the factory in 1948; people like him were not uncommon among these workers. Today, eight months later, after returning from studying in the Soviet Union, they have become the first group of people in New China who can roll seamless steel tubes with automated equipment! Now, this "fresh force" is enthusiastically waiting for production to begin. This fact proves that with the great friendship of the Chinese and Soviet people, we can not only build modern industry but also skillfully use it to produce.

(II) The Best Teachers in the World

This internship group went to the Soviet Union last autumn. The Soviet government sent them to the largest, best, and most experienced Ural First Seamless Steel Tube Plant, named after Stalin. The interns were placed in the best workshops and the best groups; each intern had a dedicated teacher, and the teachers were people who wore medals on their chests and had the titles of Stakhanovite workers or honorary metallurgical workers. The entire factory regarded teaching the Chinese comrades as an important task. The head of the factory's education department instructed the comrades who were serving as teachers: "Any number you tell the Chinese comrades must be 100% accurate!" The comrades who were serving as teachers believed that "teaching the Chinese comrades is a glorious thing," because "the strength of New China means increasing the forces for defending peace."

The honorary metallurgical worker, heating furnace foreman Gagov, who had won three medals, said: "I want to tell you all my more than 20 years of experience!" This sentence can summarize the psychology of those dear teachers. On the first day, the intern learning heating had just arrived, and he immediately began to carry out the task of teaching. He took the intern all over the heating furnace, from the top of the furnace to the preheating chamber, and even opened the flue for the intern to see. Then he said, "Try to operate it!" He asked the intern to learn from the most basic action - flipping the material. He stood behind the intern, teaching each movement by hand. In front of the students, he was always as excited as a person who had drunk enough good wine. After explaining each topic several times, he would say, "Come on, young man, try it out!" The interns were questioned by him almost every day with various questions: "What is the basis for your operation!" "What if the gas in the furnace is low now?" "How much gas should be used to burn alloy steel?" "..." He nodded and praised the interns if they did it right or answered correctly; if they answered incorrectly, he would immediately explain it in detail again. Whenever he had free time, he would sit by the heating furnace and tell the students about his experience in managing the heating furnace for more than 20 years and the various accidents he had experienced; in his spare time, he often ran to the dormitory of the internship group to find his students, and the topic of conversation was still the heating furnace; otherwise, he would invite the students to his home, put out dumplings specially made for the Chinese guests, and talk about the heating furnace while eating. During these eight months, every teacher imparted technology with such enthusiasm, and each of the forty interns could tell many such stories.

This factory calculates production by the hour, and the requirements for completing the plan are as strict as law; but in order to enable the Chinese comrades to learn the technology well, they often do not hesitate to suffer some losses in production. When the interns were learning to operate, they sometimes caused accidents due to inexperience or excessive tension – damaging equipment, tools, or producing defective products. But the teachers never showed displeasure because this would affect their completion of the plan. They enthusiastically encouraged them: "It doesn't matter, if the machine is broken, it can be repaired. From here, you can learn experience, and you can avoid such accidents after returning to your country!" "It is impossible to practice without delaying production. This kind of loss is very worthwhile. Delaying a little here is precisely for you to delay less after you go back!" There are even more touching things: Comrade Malesiev, who taught sizing machines, when talking about an accident that should be paid attention to in operation, because the content was more complicated, he explained it several times, but the students still shook their heads. He simply deliberately adjusted the machine to malfunction and squeezed out two defective products, and then pointed to the real object to explain in detail; although this affected his personal production performance, he was very happy when he saw that the students not only understood the cause of this accident but also could adjust the machine well. Once again, he deliberately messed up the machine, and the pressed steel pipes were all bent. So he told the students the reason for the bent pipe and taught the students how to prevent such accidents. One of Comrade Gagov's Chinese students accidentally put too much gas when watching the fire, and the temperature in the furnace suddenly increased, burning twenty steel billets. Comrade Gagov rushed over to teach him how to adjust it and told him: "This experience is very useful!" The next day, the comrades at the finished product inspection station came to inform Gagov: There were heating defects yesterday. Comrade Gagov immediately nodded and admitted it, but he never mentioned that it was the intern who had done it.

These best teachers in the world not only performed their tasks wholeheartedly during working hours, but many people also dedicated their spare time to their Chinese students. Electrical duty technician Comrade Peterov worked at night, but he still gave his students three hours of theory lessons every morning after get off work. Naturally, the time to prepare the lesson was also squeezed out of his rest time! The model worker Valia, who was responsible for teaching the operation of the automatic tube rolling machine, her workplace was the most labor-intensive place. It took thirteen operations to roll a tube, and it had to be completed within twelve seconds. Therefore, she could not have more time to explain to the students in detail, so she took the students' notebooks and wrote in detail on the notebook every night the operating techniques she taught during the day. Comrade Kuvakin, who taught sizing machines, specially bought a thick and beautiful notebook and wrote all the operating procedures of the sizing machine in the notebook. After writing each section, he invited the students to his home to explain it to them. He wrote on the first page of the notebook: "Take it as an eternal memorial of Sino-Soviet friendship."

(III) Big Family

In the Urals, the comrades of the internship group became the most popular guests. The eight months of internship did not make them feel like they were abroad. The Soviet friends' warm care and meticulous care made them live in a loving and warm internationalist family. As soon as the car carried them into the factory, they were surrounded by welcoming crowds, and the children cheerfully shouted: "We have been waiting for you for a long time!" The Tenth Middle School invited them to participate in the evening party, and the tenth-grade female students recited Chinese poems for them, sang Chinese songs, and taught them to dance. The workers of the Construction Trade Union also invited them to participate in the evening party and asked them: "How can we better help you build New China?" At the door of the dormitory, a group of people gathered every evening, warmly talking with them, and asking them: "Are you getting used to life?" "Have you received any letters from home?" On the street, they were often stopped by some unfamiliar friends who invited them to be guests; when children met them, they hugged their thighs: "Chinese uncle, come to my house!" In the cinema, people queuing to buy tickets pushed them to the front as soon as they saw Chinese friends and let them buy tickets first; if it was already full, someone would pull the Chinese comrades to his seat, willingly standing to watch.

In 1952, when commemorating the October Revolution Day, the factory let the comrades of the internship group stand at the forefront of the team to participate in the parade. As soon as the parade ended, the old worker Osipov invited four interns to his home. On the way, they were suddenly stopped by another Soviet comrade: "There are four Chinese friends, only two can go to your house, and the other two go to my house!" Osipov said: "I invited them, so they have to go to my house, you can invite them next time!" The two argued for a long time, and the unfamiliar friend expressed "concession", and then he put on his coat and followed to Osipov's house, and said to the Chinese friends with regret: "You must come to my house next time!" But Osipov had already "monopolized" these four Chinese friends, because they worked in the same group. Every three or four days, he would invite them to his home; if they didn't go, the old man would be angry and say, "My lover is also angry!" Every time he used a hearty dinner to entertain the guests. He personally put vegetables on the Chinese friends' plates, so that the four plates were always full, and he said in his mouth: "If you don't eat, I will be angry again!" He also took pictures with Chinese friends and wrote on it: "Never forget me!"

The eight months of study life were spent in this kind of enthusiasm. Comrade Han Li, the head of the internship group, said: "Internationalism has become a conscious virtue of every Soviet citizen, which is a very profound education for every member of our internship group!"

(IV) We Did Not Part

The study ended, and the comrades of the internship group were about to set off to return to their country. Soviet friends came to bid farewell to their students and friends. This farewell of friendship was exciting and sad. Just as dawn broke, Osipov's lover rushed to the dormitory of the internship group and cried: "I am very happy that you are going back to build your motherland, but we may not be able to see each other again, and I feel very sad!" Comrade Gagov finished his work at two o'clock in the night and ran to see him off early in the morning: "Comrades, you will still encounter problems when you go back to participate in production. Be sure to write to me and ask me!" Comrade Kuvakin instructed his students: "Write a letter every month after returning to your country, and attach an envelope with Chinese characters written on it so that I can reply to you. If we have any new methods or new records here, we will tell you. If we find that there are any places that were not explained in detail in the past, we will explain them to you again in the letter!" He also instructed: "If you encounter any problems in operation, or any difficulties in improving output and quality after your factory produces, write to us and we will help you find a solution!" The factory's parting message to the internship group was: "I wish you to roll the first steel material into the first steel pipe!"

Now, this group of students is busy in the first automated factory that New China is about to give birth to. On the way back to China, many people were moved by this friendship and made work plans after returning to China during the trip. The farewell message of Soviet friends has become the goal of struggle for all the workers in the factory. When celebrating the "May Day" festival in 1953, the main equipment of the seamless steel tube plant has begun trial operation, and the studying workers are victoriously applying their learning results. This makes them think of reunion, separation, and those dear teachers and friends far away in the Urals. They collectively wrote a warm letter to the Ural Seamless Steel Tube Plant, expressing their remembrance and gratitude. They expressed their determination to the teachers that they would definitely start this factory well. We did not part, we will always stand on the same front to build our great cause! Remember our Soviet friends firmly! When the automated equipment of our factory is started to roll out the seamless steel tubes that we have longed for, we must remember the Soviet friends, those who designed for us in Moscow, those who rushed to make equipment for us in the Soviet factories, those who guided our construction on the spot, and those who trained the first batch of tube rolling workers for us in the Urals!

    友谊
    吴少琦  顾雷
    （一）留学的工人
    鞍山的人们，常把这座肩负着历史任务的城市誉为“中苏友谊的结晶”，这不是偶然的。苏联人民为我们设计出自动化工厂，制造自动化设备，帮助把工厂建设起来，而且教会我们如何去操纵这些机器。
    在新中国第一座无缝钢管厂工地上，我们看到了这种友谊的花朵。当这座巨大的工厂即将竣工的时候，远离祖国八个月的由四十多名工人、技术人员组成的实习团，由遥远的乌拉尔，满载着先进的技术返回祖国了！他们都很年青，精神饱满，嘴角上常常浮现着激动的微笑；他们的笔记本上画满了弯弯曲曲的俄文。关于轧制无缝钢管的技术——从加热、剪断到穿孔、定径、压延……，他们每个人都懂得其中的一门，既可以独立操作，又懂得一些基本理论知识。他们一到厂子里就忙了起来，看图纸、参加试车、开座谈会、作报告，大家对他们都投以欢迎和羡慕的眼色。这些人将要成为无缝钢管厂开工生产时的基层骨干，他们的决心是：“开工时，争取用第一根钢料就轧出第一根无缝钢管！”
    八个月以前，他们还都是鞍钢各个厂矿的一般的技术工人和技术人员，没有一个人看见过这样最新式的轧制无缝钢管的自动化设备。二十二岁的朱维志，是一九四八年才入工厂、只念过三年书的小伙子；像他这样的人，在这批工人当中并不是个别的。而八个月后的今天，在他们从苏联留学回来之后，就成为新中国第一批会用自动化设备轧制无缝钢管的人了！现在，这支“生力军”正热情地等待开工生产。这个事实证明，有了中苏人民的伟大友谊，我们不但能建设起近代化的工业，而且能够熟练地运用它来生产。
    （二）世界上最好的老师
    这个实习团，是在去年秋天到苏联的。苏联政府把他们送到苏联最大、最好、最有经验的、以斯大林的名字命名的乌拉尔第一无缝钢管厂。实习生们都被安插在最好的车间、最好的小组里；每个实习生有一位专责的教师，教师们都是胸前挂着勋章、有斯大哈诺夫工作者或荣誉冶金工作者的头衔的人。整个工厂都把教会中国同志作为重要的任务。工厂的教育处长嘱咐担任教师的同志们：“你们告诉中国同志的任何一个数目字都必须百分之百的准确！”担任教师的同志都认为“教会中国同志是光荣的事”，因为“新中国的强盛，就是增加保卫和平的力量”。
    得过三次勋章的荣誉冶金工作者、加热炉的炉长加果夫同志说：“我要把二十多年的经验全告诉你们！”这句话，是可以概括那些亲爱的老师们的心理的。第一天，学加热的实习生刚刚到他那里，他马上就开始执行教师的任务。他带着实习的同志从加热炉的炉顶直到预热室全都走遍了，把烟道也揭开给实习的同志看看。然后说：“试试操作吧！”叫实习的同志从最初步的动作——翻料学起，他站在实习生的背后，把着手教每个动作。他在学生的面前，一直是像喝了足量的美酒的人那样地兴奋，他把每个题目讲了几遍之后就说：“来，小伙子，干一下看看！”实习生们几乎每天都要被他用各种各样的问题来考问：“你这么操作的根据是什么！”“现在炉里瓦斯低了怎办？”“烧合金钢得用多少瓦斯？”“……”实习生做对了或答对了，他就点头称赞；如果答不对，他马上又详细地讲解一阵。每一空下来，他就坐在加热炉旁给学生们讲他二十几年来管理加热炉的经验和经历过的各种事故；在业余时间，他常常跑到实习团的宿舍去找他的学生，谈话的题目仍然是加热炉；不然就把学生们邀到他的家里去，摆出特为给中国客人包的饺子，边吃边谈加热炉。在这八个月当中，每一位老师都是以这样的热情传授技术的，四十名实习的同志每个人都能讲出很多这样的事例。
    这个工厂是按小时来计算产量的，对完成计划的要求像法律一样地严格；但为了使中国的同志学好技术，他们往往不惜使生产受到一些损失。实习生们在初学操作时，因为不熟练或过份紧张，有时就造成事故——损坏了设备、工具或是出了废品，但教师们从没有因为这样会影响他们完成计划而表示不快。他们热情地鼓励说：“不要紧，机器坏了能修，从这里你们可以学到经验，回国以后就可以避免这样的事故了！”“实习不耽误生产是不可能的。这种损失非常值得，在这里耽误了一点，正是为了你们回去以后少耽误！”还有更感动人的事：教定径机的马列西耶夫同志，在讲到操作上应该注意防止的一种事故时，因为内容比较复杂，讲了几遍，学生们还是摇头。他索性故意把机器调整出毛病，压出了两根废品，然后指着实物再详细地讲解；虽然这影响了他个人的生产成绩，但当他看见学生们不仅懂得了这种事故发生的原因而且可以把机器调整好的时候，却非常高兴。还有一次，他又故意把机器弄出毛病，压出的钢管就都是弯的。于是他又给学生们讲出弯管的道理，教会学生怎样防止这样的事故。加果夫同志的一个中国学生，有一次在看火的时候把瓦斯放多了，炉里的温度突然增高，一下烧坏了二十根钢坯。加果夫同志赶忙跑过来教他调整过来，并且告诉他：“这个经验很有用！”第二天，成品检查台的同志来通知加果夫：昨天有加热废品。加果夫同志马上点头承认，但却根本没提这是实习生弄的。
    这些世界上最好的教师，不仅仅是在工作时间这样全心全意地执行他们的任务，很多人把自己的业余时间也都献给了他的中国学生。电气值班技师彼德洛夫同志是在夜里工作的，但他每天早晨下班以后还给他的学生们讲三个小时的理论课，自然，准备课的时间也是从他的休息时间挤出的！负责教自动轧管机运转的是模范工作者瓦莉亚，她的工作场所是劳动最紧张的地方，轧一根管子要操作十三次，并且要在十二秒钟以内做完，因此她不可能有更多的时间详细地给学生讲解，她就把学生的笔记本要来，每天晚上把她白天教的操作技术详细地写在笔记本上。教定径机的库瓦金同志特为买了一个厚厚的漂亮本子，把定径机的全部操作过程都写在本子上，每写完一节就把学生请到家里去给他们讲解一次，他在本子的第一页上写着：“把它作为中苏友谊的永恒的纪念”。
    （三）大家庭
    在乌拉尔，实习团的同志们成了最受欢迎的客人。八个月的实习生活并没有使他们感觉到是在国外，苏联朋友的热情的关怀和无微不至的照顾，使他们生活在友爱、温暖的国际主义大家庭里。汽车刚刚把他们载进工厂，就被欢迎的人群包围起来，孩子们愉快地嚷着：“等你们好久了！”第十中学请他们去参加晚会，十年级的女学生给他们朗诵中国诗，唱中国歌，教他们跳舞。建筑工会的工人也请他们去参加晚会，问他们：“我们得怎样更好地帮助你们建设新中国呢？”在宿舍门口，每天傍晚都要围上一群人，热情地和他们交谈，问他们：“生活是不是习惯？”“家里有没有信来？”在街上，他们经常被一些不相识的朋友拦住，邀请他们去作客；小孩子遇见他们时，就抱住他们的大腿：“中国叔叔，到我家去！”在电影院里，排队买票的人们一看到中国朋友，就把他们推到前面去，让他们先买票子；如果已经客满，就又有人把中国同志拉到他的座位上，自己甘愿站着看。
    在一九五二年纪念十月革命节的时候，工厂让实习团的同志站在队伍的最前列参加游行。游行刚完，老工人奥希波夫就邀了四个实习的同志到他家去。在路上，他们突然被另一个苏联同志拦住了：“中国朋友是四个人，到你家去两个就行，另外两位到我家去！”奥希波夫说：“这是我邀来的，就得到我家去，你下次再邀请吧！”两人争执了很久，那位不相识的朋友表示“让步”，随后他穿上大衣也跟着到奥希波夫的家里去了，并很遗憾地对中国朋友说：“下次一定得到我家去！”但奥希波夫早已把这四位中国朋友“垄断”起来，因为他们是在一个组里工作的。每隔三、四天就要请到他家去一次；如果不去，老头就生气，并说“我爱人也生气了！”每次他都是用丰盛的晚餐来招待客人，他亲手往中国朋友的盘子里拨菜，让那四个餐盘总是满满的，嘴里还说：“不吃我又要生气了！”他还和中国朋友在一起拍了照片，在上面写着：“永远不要忘记我！”
    八个月的学习生活，就是在这种热情中度过的，实习团团长寒力同志说：“国际主义精神已经成为每个苏联公民的自觉的美德，这对我们实习团的每个团员都是极深刻的教育！”
    （四）我们并没有别离
    学习结束，实习团的同志们要启程回国了，苏联朋友们都来送别他们的学生和朋友。这种友谊的别离，是兴奋而又难过的。天刚刚亮，奥希波夫的爱人就赶到实习团的宿舍，哭着说：“你们要回去建设祖国，我很高兴，但我们说不定什么时候才能再见，心里又很难过！”加果夫同志夜间两点才结束工作，清早就跑来送行：“同志，回去参加生产还会遇到问题，千万要来信问我啊！”库瓦金同志嘱咐他的学生说：“回国以后每个月都要来一封信，要附上一个写好中国字的信封，我好给你们回信。我们这里出现什么新方法、新纪录，都告诉你们，如果发现过去有哪些地方讲得不详细，也在信上给你们再讲一遍！”又嘱咐：“你们工厂生产以后，在操作上遇到了什么问题，在提高产量、质量上遇到了什么困难，都写信来，我们帮你们想办法！”工厂对实习团的临别赠言是：“祝你们把第一根钢料就轧成第一根钢管！”
    现在，这批留学生已经在新中国即将诞生的第一座自动化工厂里忙碌着。在回国的路上，好多人被这种友谊所感动，在行程中就订出了回国以后的工作计划。苏联朋友对他们的临别赠言，已成为全厂工人奋斗的目标。在庆祝一九五三年“五一”节的时候，无缝钢管厂的主要设备已开始试车，留学的工人们正在胜利地运用自己的学习成果。这就使他们想到了团聚、别离，想到了那些远在乌拉尔的亲爱的老师和朋友。他们集体给乌拉尔无缝钢管厂写了一封热情的信，倾述他们的怀念和感激，他们向老师们表示了决心，一定把这座工厂很好地开动起来。我们并没有别离，我们将永远站在同一的战线上来建设我们的伟大事业！牢牢地记住我们的苏联朋友吧！当我们工厂的自动化设备开动起来轧制出我们渴望已久的无缝钢管的时候，我们要记起苏联朋友们，那在莫斯科为我们设计的、那在苏联的工厂里为我们赶制设备的、那在现场上指导我们施工的、和那在乌拉尔为我们培养第一批轧管工人的朋友们！
