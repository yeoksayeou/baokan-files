    Hejian County Cooperatives Solely Pursue Profits; Most Village Cooperatives in the County Are on the Verge of Collapse

    A letter from He Weiyu, a people's representative from Longhuadian, Hejian County, Hebei Province: The Hejian County Cooperative Union has a serious "skimming" mentality. They do not serve the lower-level cooperatives well, but instead focus on extracting high profits, which the masses are very dissatisfied with. Take kerosene for example. The County Union and the Hejian Team of the Hengshui Branch of the Petroleum Corporation are both in Hejian City, but the County Union's kerosene price is higher than that of the Petroleum Corporation, and even more expensive than that of private merchants. Another example is coal. The coal transported by the County Union from Cang County to the village cooperatives is also more expensive than the market price, even after adding the cartage fee. However, the village cooperatives can only purchase goods from the County Union, so the goods of each village cooperative are more expensive than those of private merchants. The goods of the village cooperatives cannot be sold, and there is no source for expenses. It seems that eight or nine out of the thirty-two village cooperatives in the county are on the verge of collapse. Please, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative Federation, immediately find a way to rectify the Hejian County Cooperatives.

### 河间县合作社单纯追求利润  全县大部村社眼看都要垮台

    河间县合作社单纯追求利润  全县大部村社眼看都要垮台
    河北省河间县龙华店人民代表何维玉来信：河间县合作社联合社有着严重的“剥皮”思想。他们不好好为下级合作社服务，专门想剥取高额利润，群众对此十分不满。拿煤油来说，县联社和石油公司衡水支公司河间小组都在河间城内，可是县联社的煤油价格要比石油公司高，甚至比私商的也要贵好多。又比如煤吧，县联社由沧县运给村社的煤，加上大车费也比市上的贵。可是村社只能向县社购货，各个村社的货物因此都比私商要贵。村社的货物销不出去，开支没地方来。眼看全县三十二个村社十有八九要垮台。请河北省合作总社立即设法整顿河间县合作社。
