Learn from the Lessons of Cooperatives Issuing Circulation Vouchers in Nantong and Other Places

    During last year's cotton purchasing work, some cooperatives and tax bureaus in Nantong and Sheyang counties, Jiangsu Province, and the suburbs of Shanghai issued various forms of circulation vouchers, causing some confusion in the local market. Under the leadership of the local party and government organs, relevant units have inspected and corrected this phenomenon, and all or most of the issued circulation vouchers have been recovered. However, the lessons of this matter should be taken seriously by cadres of state-owned trading enterprises and cooperatives to improve cotton purchasing and other procurement work.
    From last autumn to this spring, eight grassroots cooperatives in Sanyu, Haiyan, and other areas of Nantong and Sheyang counties, Jiangsu Province, successively issued various circulation vouchers totaling more than 3 billion yuan. Cooperatives and individual tax bureaus in Yangsi, Yangjing, Dachang, and other districts in the suburbs of Shanghai issued 6.33 billion yuan. The names included "exchange vouchers," "goods allocation slips," "cotton farmer purchase vouchers," and "agricultural tax payment vouchers." Except for a few indefinite amounts, the face value of the fixed-amount circulation vouchers ranged from 10,000 to 200,000 yuan. As the names suggest, these securities were used for purchasing goods from cooperatives, paying agricultural taxes, saving, or circulating between farmers, members, and cooperatives, tax bureaus, and banks. The large amount of circulation vouchers put into the market violated the state's financial policy and the interests of the people. This was, in effect, a means by which cooperatives forced farmers and members to use the circulation vouchers they issued to purchase goods, deposit in kind, and save in banks. Some farmers and members took the vouchers to the cooperative for cashing, but the cooperative refused to cash them and only allowed them to purchase goods; some farmers took the vouchers to the cooperative to purchase goods, but the cooperative had no goods, so they "mobilized" the farmers to deposit in kind. This caused a very bad influence among the masses.
    Why did this phenomenon occur? There are the following reasons and situations. One is that cadres in cooperative and other business departments do not pay attention to business and policy learning, and there is a serious style of commandism. As stated in Shanghai's cooperative's self-criticism, the cadres of the cooperative only considered the "simplified procedures" for the cooperative on this issue, did not realize that this was a violation of policy, and even promoted it as a "creation" in their work. The Yangsi District Cooperative mentioned this matter in a cotton collection report in November last year, and the Municipal Cooperative Cotton Collection Office praised it in the "Cotton Collection Situation" publication, saying: "The Yangsi District Cooperative issues supply material vouchers to cotton farmers, who can use these vouchers to buy what they need at the supply and marketing station. In addition, they encourage cotton farmers to deposit in kind, reducing the use of cash."
    Another major reason is that the upper-level institutions of the state-owned trade system and the cooperative system underestimated the increase in cotton production in 1952 and the rapid and large influx of new cotton into the market, and therefore did not fully prepare and take effective measures to prevent problems that might occur in cotton purchasing. When a large amount of new cotton was put on the market last year, cooperatives and state-owned trade systems were passive in cotton purchasing. The originally planned purchase plan could not meet the needs of the masses to sell cotton, the plan was broken through, and the purchase, storage, and processing could not keep up with the needs, and funds were even more insufficient. At that time, the way to change this situation should have been to promptly stipulate seasonal price differences for cotton and effectively lead the masses to sell cotton in an organized manner, on the one hand, and to revise unrealistic plans in a timely manner and strengthen the work of each link of cotton purchasing, on the other hand. However, these agencies did not do so. The poor coordination between the state-owned trade system and the cooperative system in cotton purchasing caused many difficulties for grassroots cotton purchasing units. For example, the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation system has long and universally owed a large amount of cotton purchase payments to cooperatives. According to statistics at the end of December last year, the East China Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation system owed cooperatives in various places 480.4 billion yuan, which prompted some cotton collection points in Nantong, Sheyang, and some cotton-producing areas in Shandong to limit or stop purchases, and issue circulation vouchers to maintain purchases. This was evident in Jiangsu's Nantong and Sheyang, and several cotton-producing areas in Shandong.
    Facts show that only by earnestly studying policies, delving into business, strengthening inspection work, and strictly implementing the reporting and requesting system, and resolutely fighting against bureaucracy, commandism, and the phenomena of disconnection between upper and lower levels and uncoordinated decentralism, can we avoid the occurrence of various chaotic phenomena and do a good job in cotton purchasing and other procurement work.

### 接受南通等地合作社发流通券的教训

    接受南通等地合作社发流通券的教训
    在去年的购棉工作中，江苏南通、射阳两县和上海市郊区的某些合作社、税务局等单位，曾经印行了形形色色的流通券，使当地市场发生了若干混乱现象。在当地党政机关领导之下，有关单位已经检查、纠正了这种现象，发行的流通券全部或大部分也已收回了。但这件事情的教训应该引起国营贸易企业和合作社干部的重视，以改进购棉及其他采购工作。
    江苏南通、射阳两县所属三余、海晏等八个基层合作社，自去秋到今春，先后发行的各种流通券有三十多亿元。上海市郊杨思、洋泾、大场等区合作社和个别税务局发行了六十三亿三千多万元。名称有“兑换券”、“拨货凭单”、“棉农购货凭单”、“抵缴农业税凭单”等。其中除少数不定额的以外，定额流通券的票面数额，从一万元至二十万元不等。顾名思义，这些证券是用于向合作社购货、纳农业税、储蓄或在农民、社员和合作社、税务局、银行之间流通的。这样大量的流通券投入市场，当然违反了国家金融政策和人民的利益。这实际上是合作社强制农民、社员使用自己所发行的流通券，来向自己购货、存实以及向银行储蓄的强迫命令的手段。有的农民、社员持券到合作社兑现，合作社不准兑现，只准购货；有的农民持券到合作社购货，合作社无货，就“动员”农民存实。这就在群众中引起了很坏的影响。
    为什么会产生这种现象呢？这有以下的原因和情况。一个是，合作社等业务部门的干部，平时不注意业务、政策学习，存在着严重的强迫命令作风。正如上海市合作社检讨中所说的，合作社的干部在这个问题上，只考虑到合作社的“简化手续”，没有认识到这是违反政策的行为，还作为一种工作中的“创造”去推广。杨思区合作社去年十一月间在收棉报告表中提起这件事，市合作社收棉办公室在“收棉情况”的刊物上加以表扬，说：“杨思区合作社以所开供应物资凭证给棉农，持此据去供销站买所需要的东西，另外鼓励棉农存实，减少了现金使用。”
    另一个主要原因是国营贸易系统和合作社系统的上层机构，对一九五二年棉产的增长和新棉迅速、大量地涌入市场的情况估计不足，因而没有充分准备和采取有效措施，防止购棉中可能发生的问题。当去年新棉大量上市以后，合作社和国营贸易系统在购棉中就处处表现被动，原订的收购计划不能满足群众售棉的要求，计划被突破了，收购、仓储、加工都跟不上需要，资金更加不足。当时改变这一状况的办法，应该一方面及时规定棉花季节差价，并切实领导群众有组织地进行售棉，另一方面及时修订不切合实际的计划，加强购棉各个环节的工作。但是这些机关没有这样做。国营贸易系统和合作社系统在购棉中配合很差，更给基层购棉单位造成许多困难。如花纱布公司系统就长期地、普遍地拖欠了合作社大量购棉款。据去年十二月底的统计，华东花纱布公司系统欠各地合作社款达四千八百零四亿元，这就促使了各地合作社的若干收棉点发生限购、停购、印发流通券以维持收购的现象。这在江苏南通、射阳和山东若干产棉区表现得很明显。
    事实说明：只有认真学习政策、钻研业务、加强检查工作和严格执行报告请示制度，和官僚主义、命令主义与上下脱节、左右不配合的分散主义现象进行坚决斗争，才能避免各种混乱现象产生，做好购棉及其他采购工作。（本报上海记者站）
