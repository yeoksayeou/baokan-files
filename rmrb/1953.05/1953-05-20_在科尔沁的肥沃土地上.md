The train sped across the vast fields of Inner Mongolia. I got off at Ningjia Station near Ulanhot and visited the Li Jinming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Juxin Village, Horqin Right Front Banner. This is a cooperative jointly formed by Mongolian and Han farmers. In the process of developing from mutual aid teams to cooperatives, they have sincerely united, helped each other, and established new ethnic relations for common interests.

Inner Mongolia not only has boundless grasslands and herds of fat cattle and sheep, but also vast fertile land. The more than eighty hectares of land of the Li Jinming Agricultural Production Cooperative is a piece of black fertile soil. The Tao'er River flows with clear water. Li Jinming, the director of the cooperative, led me to visit the land and crops by the river. Before the Qingming Festival, they had already finished sowing thirteen hectares of wheat. Now, the wheat seedlings have emerged three inches, looking like a green carpet from afar. Last year, they irrigated the land, and the wheat had a bumper harvest. This year, they installed new waterwheels on three vertical wells, and all the wheat fields have been irrigated, and germination has also been advanced. When sowing millet, they adopted the new cultivation method of "equal-distance wide sowing." I personally saw the millet grains mixed with red "Ceresan" (insecticide) falling evenly on the ground from the planter, and then covered with bottom fertilizer and soil. I saw the wide and flat sowing width rolled by the improved farm tools. Looking along the millet field, the land prepared for planting soybeans and corn is full of manure, and in the distance, there are several wellheads. They have prepared sufficient fertilizer and dug dozens of wells for drought prevention.

In the afternoon, cooperative member Bi Lijia Lima led me to see his flock of sheep. The sheep with snow-white fleece were resting in the sheepfold, and the lambs were lying under the ewes' bellies, suckling. Bi Lijia Lima picked up a lively lamb and stroked it lovingly. He told me that four years ago, they only had four sheep, and now there are more than one hundred and ninety in the fold. We also visited the production cooperative's herds of horses and cattle, and saw newborn foals and calves. The number of horses and cattle is also gradually increasing. Because dairy cows are raised, Mongolian and Han members can now drink fresh milk.

In the middle of Juxin Village, a small village, the members built five houses themselves to serve as the cooperative's office. Every morning, as soon as the bell in front of the cooperative rings, the male and female members gather in the cooperative, those who harness the cattle, those who harness the horse-drawn carts, those who take the seeds, and those who take the farm tools, and are busy doing their respective work. At dusk, the herds of cattle and sheep return slowly from the pasture, and the people from the farmland also return to the village one after another. After they finish dinner, they also have to evaluate work points together and discuss the work for the next day. What a tense and harmonious life! They were not like this before. Like the people of other ethnic minorities in other regions, Mongolian and Han farmers in the past lived a very difficult life under the instigation and oppression of imperialism and reactionary rulers, and they were suspicious of each other and very disunited. It was not until after liberation that, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they jointly carried out the anti-feudal struggle, and they understood the common source of suffering and the prospect of happiness. On this basis, they organized mutual aid teams. In 1949, there were only five mutual aid team members, which was a temporary mutual aid. Production was reaped the following year, the mutual aid team became permanent, and the members gradually increased. Last year, it increased to eighteen households. This spring, after it was converted into an agricultural production cooperative, four new households joined, totaling twelve Han households and ten Mongolian households, and the male and female labor forces were almost equal.

Mongolian people are good at raising livestock, but they are relatively extensive in agricultural cultivation techniques. They have no habit of applying fertilizer. Manure accumulates year after year, some are dried and used as firewood, and some are filled in ditches. Sowing is "scattered spreading." The Han members taught them the methods of more hoeing, more harrowing, and more fertilizing. In 1950, the millet grew taller than people, and the corn stalks were as thick as small trees. In 1951, there was a drought here, and Li Jinming called on everyone to dig wells to fight the drought. Some Mongolian members were not convinced, and as a result, many wheat fields dried up and could not receive seeds. The facts educated everyone, and last year the whole group opened twenty-eight wells. Mongolian members calculated for me that in the past, each hectare of land could only produce about three shi of grain on average. After helping and uniting with Han farmers and improving cultivation methods, grain production has doubled.

Han members know how to cultivate intensively, but they do not know the tricks of raising livestock. In 1949, Mongolian members first bought four sheep, and they all gave birth to lambs the following year. After the fine wool was sold, it was exchanged for clothing materials. Under their mobilization, Han members also bought sheep. The year before last, there was a drought, and the grain suffered losses. They received help from the sheep and wool. Now, Han members have also learned to assist with lambing, milking, and raising livestock.

In production, Mongolian and Han people learn from each other and help each other with sincerity and friendship. Now, wheat, millet, and soybeans have been planted on the black land of Juxin Village; in the slopes and grass bushes in the east of the village, herds of cattle and sheep are grazing. Mongolian and Han members are working hard and happily together for a better and happier future.

    在科尔沁的肥沃土地上
    新华社记者  彭逢烨
    火车在内蒙古宽阔的原野上疾驶。在靠近乌兰浩特市的宁家站下车，我访问了科尔沁右翼前旗巨心屯的李金铭农业生产合作社。这是一个由蒙、汉族农民联合组成的合作社。从互助组到合作社的发展过程中，他们真诚团结、互助友爱，为共同利益而建立了新的民族关系。
    内蒙古不仅有漫无边际的草场和成群肥壮的牛羊，还有广袤的肥沃土地。李金铭农业生产合作社的八十多垧土地，就是一片黑色的沃土。洮儿河流着清澄的水。合作社主任李金铭领我参观了河边的土地和庄稼。清明节前，他们就把十三垧小麦播种完了。现在，麦苗已出土三寸，远远望去，像一片绿色的地毯。去年，他们用水浇地，小麦得到了丰收，今年他们在三口竖井上安装了新式水车，小麦地全都灌过水，发芽也提早了。在播种谷子时，他们采用了“等距宽播”的新耕作法。我亲眼见到拌过红色“赛力散”（虫药）的谷粒从点播器里均匀地落在地上，然后盖上底粪和土。我看到改良农具滚过的又宽又平的播幅。沿着谷地望过去，在准备种大豆和玉米的土地上，满堆着粪料，远处，冒着几处井口。他们准备了充足的肥料，为着防旱，还打了几十口水井。
    下午，社员毕利加里玛领我去看看他放牧的羊群。长着雪白绒毛的绵羊，正在羊圈里歇息，小羊羔伏在母羊腹下吃奶。毕利加里玛顺手抱起一只活泼的羊羔，疼爱地抚摸着。他告诉我，四年前他们只有四只绵羊，现在圈里已有一百九十多只了。我们还参观了生产合作社的马群、牛群，看见新生的马驹和牛犊。马、牛的数量也在逐渐上升。因为饲养了乳牛，蒙、汉族社员现在都能喝到新鲜的牛奶。
    在巨心屯这个小寨子的中间，社员们自己盖了五间房屋，作为合作社的社址。每天清晨，社前的钟声一响，男女社员们便聚集在社内，架耕牛的、架马车的、拿种籽的、拿农具的，忙着去干各人的工作。黄昏，牛、羊群从草场缓步归来，农地上的人们也陆续回村。他们吃完晚餐以后，还要在一起评工分，商量着第二天的工作。多么紧张而又和睦的生活呵！他们原先并不是这样的。蒙、汉族农民也像其他地区的兄弟民族人民一样，过去在帝国主义和反动统治者的挑拨压迫下，大家过着十分困苦的日子，而又彼此猜疑，很不团结。直到解放以后，他们在共产党的领导下，共同进行了反封建的斗争，才明白了共同的痛苦根源和幸福远景。在这个基础上他们组织了互助组。一九四九年的时候，只有五户互助组员，是临时性质的互助，生产第二年得到了丰收，互助组变为常年的，组员也逐渐增加。去年增到了十八户组员，今年春天转为农业生产合作社后又新加入四户，一共是十二户汉族和十户蒙族，男、女劳动力也几乎相等。
    蒙族人民善于饲养牲畜，但在农业耕作技术上比较粗放。他们没有施肥的习惯，畜粪一年年堆积起来，有的晒干当柴烧，有的填塞了沟渠，播种是“漫片扬”（撒播）。汉族组员便教给他们多铲、多趟、多施肥料的方法，一九五○年谷子长得比人高，玉米杆粗壮的像小树。一九五一年这里天旱，李金铭号召大家打井抗旱，有些蒙族组员不信服，结果许多麦田干坏了，收不到种子。事实教育了大家，去年全组开了二十八口井。蒙族社员们向我算了一回账，以前每垧地平均只能打粮三石左右，和汉族农民互助团结、提高耕作方法以后，粮食产量已经增加了一倍。
    汉族社员懂得精耕细作，但却不知道饲养牲畜的窍门。一九四九年，蒙族社员首先买回了四只羊，第二年都下了羊羔，细绒的羊毛售出后，换得了衣料。在他们的动员下，汉族组员也买了绵羊。前年天旱，粮食遭到损失，他们从羊只和羊毛上得到了帮助。现在，汉族社员也学会接羔、挤奶和饲养牲畜了。
    蒙、汉人民在生产中，就是这样真诚友爱地互相学习、互相帮助。现在，巨心屯的黑色土地上，已经种上了小麦、谷子和大豆；屯东的山坡草丛里，放牧着成群的牛羊。蒙、汉社员正在共同为美好幸福的未来而辛勤、愉快地耕作着。
