Editor's Note: Guan Zhenling is a cook in a certain battalion of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. He comes from a working-class background and only studied for three and a half years. After the unit launched a cultural learning campaign, he actively studied, improved his cultural level, and wrote an autobiographical novel of 80,000 words. This novel describes the struggle of steelworkers against the enemy in a steel mill where he worked during the Japanese occupation. What is published here are two excerpts from it.

　　Master Gao

　　A flat-bottom steelmaking furnace was built on the open space east of the steel mill. The Japanese said that once this furnace was built, each furnace could smelt 30 tons of steel. For more than a year, the plant building and furnace base were built, leaving only the refractory bricks to be laid inside the furnace and in the gas passages.

　　Master Gao's craftsmanship was really good, laying bricks quickly and well, and two people couldn't keep up with him. The Japanese admired him very much. The Japanese didn't allow anyone to go to the place where he was laying bricks for even a day, so everyone wanted to be with him. Every morning when Master Gao assigned work, one would say, "Master Gao, let me go with you!" Another would say, "Let me go with you too!" Shu Zhu had only been here for a few days and didn't know what was going on. He thought, "It's all the same work no matter who you're with."

　　That day, Shu Zhu was also lucky enough to be called by Master Gao to work with him. When they arrived at the construction site, they carried two trips of refractory bricks and three bags of clay and then rested. Master Gao had one characteristic when working: he had to have one or two people on guard for him, coughing when the Japanese came. It was Shu Zhu's first time working with Master Gao, so he was told to sit behind a pile of bricks and stand guard. A square hole was left in the middle of the brick stack, directly facing the passage from the office to here. Master Gao and the others didn't lay bricks, but sat in the gas chamber under the furnace, telling jokes. Around lunchtime, two workers came out of the gas combustion chamber and moved the red bricks next to Shu Zhu to a large pit not far away, poured some dirt on top, and stepped on it with their feet. Shu Zhu was puzzled: why bury the good refractory bricks and send the bad bricks into the gas combustion chamber instead?

　　Once, when the Japanese came, before Shu Zhu could cough, a worker pulled him away and hurried him to carry bricks. The trowel inside also clanged noisily. When the Japanese came over and looked, the original two large piles of refractory bricks were almost laid. He only leaned against the door and looked inside before going elsewhere. Shu Zhu didn't dare to ask, as it happened every day.

　　Master Gao had his own way of laying bricks inside the furnace. Originally, to build this kind of heat-resistant wall, you needed a layer of red brick, a layer of steel brick, and a layer of refractory brick. The three layers of bricks had to be laid together. If it wasn't laid well, gas would spray from the brick joints when firing, which was very dangerous. Master Gao laid bricks very quickly, two or three layers in the blink of an eye. Once, when Shu Zhu brought him mud, he saw that the middle layer of bricks was completely broken and not stacked. He was told to pour the mud on the broken bricks, and he smeared it with a trowel, followed by a layer of neat bricks on top. Most of the day's work was done this way. "Is it okay to lay it like this?" Shu Zhu asked in surprise, "What if the Japanese see it?" Master Gao said, "Don't worry, I'll tell you when I have time." Near lunchtime, the Japanese came in with a meter stick, measured it, and saw that half a meter high had been laid this morning. He pushed the laid bricks with his hand, didn't move them, and they were very neat. He said "Very good!" and went back to the office.

　　The Japanese had to sleep for two or three hours from 12:00 noon to 3:00 pm. After the workers finished eating, they also found a cool place to sit together and chat. This noon, more than forty bricklayers and workers were sitting in the boiler room. Shu Zhu leaned against a door panel, moved a few bricks, sat on them, and kept looking at the passage directly to the office, listening to Master Gao's speech with both ears: "When the Japanese come, don't panic. Just do what I do!" His usually smiling face was serious at this time. Then he said, "Do you know why I lay bricks so fast? Because we are Chinese! We cannot hand over steel to the enemy! To let the enemy kill our parents and brothers! Everyone who has worked with me for two days understands, no need to say more. From tomorrow on, do as I do, and you can't go wrong. We must unite together. We are not afraid even if there are more Japanese. Anyway, we can't let the Japanese smelt steel smoothly!" Shu Zhu loved listening to these words from the bottom of his heart. Then Master Gao told some stories about how workers, under the leadership of the trade union, fought against the capitalists in the past. Everyone listened with their eyes wide open.

　　Shu Zhu was so busy listening to Master Gao that he forgot to look at the Japanese. Suddenly, he heard footsteps. When he looked back, "Big Knife" [Note] was almost at the door. He quickly coughed, pretending not to see. He heard Master Gao speak in a loud voice: "We can lay 800 bricks a day..." "Big Knife" smiled and walked into the room and said, "Gao's is the best. None of you can work." Master Gao ignored "Big Knife" and continued, "Everyone do as I said, and you can't go wrong." After this meeting, everyone didn't feel tired when working. Every day at lunchtime, the workers gathered around Master Gao to listen to stories. The Japanese only thought that the speed of bricklaying had increased, but they didn't know that the refractory bricks were all buried in the big pit!

　　For more than four months, everyone was very close to Master Gao, like brothers. They missed him if they didn't see him for a day. These days, the Japanese were busy, running around all day, and even the factory director, Old Nakajo, came to see it several times. The flat furnace project was almost completed, with only some odd jobs left. Ship after ship of scrap iron and bituminous coal were constantly unloaded into the factory, filling all the open spaces. The number of temporary workers doubled, preparing to light the furnace to warm it next week. The gas furnace also began to test fire. The Japanese were waiting to pour out the steel from the furnace to massacre the Chinese people.

　　On Monday morning, it was almost eight o'clock, and Master Gao hadn't come yet.

　　"Is he sick?" Shu Zhu thought, "No, we left work together on Saturday, and he was in good health. Is something wrong? Today is the day to collect grain and money. Why isn't he coming?" This day, everyone showed that they had no energy because Master Gao didn't come to work, as if they were missing something. The Japanese were also looking for him, because today they were going to warm the furnace, and there was still a section of refractory brick in the gas passage that hadn't been turned. The Japanese didn't trust others to turn it, fearing that it wouldn't be turned well and a malfunction would occur.

　　Until after work, Master Gao still hadn't come. Shu Zhu didn't go home after work. He went to find Master Gao on an empty stomach. From far away from his house, he saw Master Gao standing at the door, looking this way. "I knew you would come to find me. Come in and sit!" Shu Zhu was stunned when he entered the house: "Are you moving? Where are you going tonight?" "Maybe back to the Northeast, maybe to Xuanhua, I don't know where. Sit down, I have something to tell you." After getting along for a few months, he suddenly heard that he was leaving, and he was really a little reluctant. "Can't you not go?" "I should go. You will understand the reason why I'm leaving in two or three days. But I have a word for you to remember: Don't forget that we are Chinese. We must not let the Japanese get steel smoothly and use it to massacre the Chinese people! As long as everyone is united, we are not afraid of any difficulties." For a long time, Master Gao didn't speak. Shu Zhu knew that he didn't have time at this time, so he stood up and said, "Then I'll go?" Before he finished speaking, he couldn't help but shed tears. Master Gao nodded and said, "Okay." He lowered his head, and the words "Goodbye" were inaudible.

　　On the third day of warming the furnace, at about nine o'clock in the morning, the coal distribution disk in the gas furnace was burned out. The factory director ordered to stop the fire and replace it with another one. When the gas furnace was running for the second time, there was a "boom," and the male and female workers working under the flat furnace were all scared away. At the bottom of the flat furnace, the top of the west wall of the gas combustion chamber cracked with a three-inch long crack, and fire was coming out. The Japanese ran over to take a look, but they couldn't figure out whether the bottom of the furnace was lifted up by the gas, or the wall had sunk. There was no way, so they had to temporarily smear it with clay and wait for the furnace to dry before talking about it.

　　Don't Give the Enemy Steel

　　The preparations for opening the furnace were completely done. The transport workers carried the scrap iron and steel to the bottom of the crane, and then the crane lifted it to the upper floor. The molds for casting steel ingots were also all stacked. The Japanese planned to start the first furnace of steel at twelve o'clock tonight. When they saw the workers, they said, "Everyone will get a bonus of five yuan tomorrow, for sure!" In the afternoon, a Japanese monk was brought in by car, and he recited a mourning sutra when the fire was lit.

　　When going to work the next morning, a dozen Japanese were circling around the gas furnace and flat furnace. The workers on the night shift had red eyes and were so tired that they staggered when they walked. The Japanese were cursing "Baga Baga" non-stop. It turned out that the gas produced by the gas furnace could not be sent into the furnace. The Japanese planned to test the furnace at twelve o'clock, but they hadn't been able to achieve the goal until now, so they had to stop the operation of the gas furnace and check it. After spending a long time, they found that the bricks laid inside the gas passage had all collapsed piece by piece, blocking the steel pipe, and a large crack had also appeared in the wall of the gas combustion chamber, almost collapsing. The Japanese were all so angry that their faces were the color of ginger, and their eyes were as big as bull's eyes, staring blankly at the cracked seam. Soon, the flat furnace director, Zuo Chuan, went straight in the eyes, shouting and jumping around like crazy: "Quickly bring Gao here! Even if he's dead!" At that time, "Big Knife" left with two guards. When Shu Zhu and other workers saw this situation, they gave each other a wink, thinking in their hearts: Bastards! Still want to find Master Gao? You won't even find his shadow!

　　Soon, "Big Knife" ran back covered in sweat, panting, and his face turned white with anger, trying hard to speak but couldn't. He managed to stutter out a sentence: "Gao...Gao ran away!" As soon as Zuo Chuan heard that Master Gao had run away, he immediately said: "Bring all the bricklayers!" It happened that not a single bricklayer came today. Where were the Japanese going to find them? Looking at this situation, if they wanted to smelt steel, they would have to rebuild it from scratch.

　　Shu Zhu called all the workers to the boiler room and said to everyone, "The walls that were laid, the bricks that were turned, are collapsing and falling. The Japanese can't find Master Gao and the bricklayers, so they will definitely take it out on us. Master Gao told me when he left: 'We are Chinese, and we cannot let the Japanese get steel smoothly and use it to massacre the Chinese people.' We won't have any benefits here either, so we might as well say goodbye without saying goodbye. The Zhongshan Iron and Steel Plant in Louzhuangzi is about to start construction, and I know a technician surnamed Wang there. We can go there to find him. What do you think?" Everyone answered, "Master Gao's words can't be wrong! We'll all go to the Iron and Steel Plant and leave this place alone. Bastard Japanese, let them go waste their time!"

　　[Note] The chief of the steel mill's security guards (Japanese), who carried a large knife in his hand every day to monitor the workers. The workers gave him the nickname "Big Knife."

    不给敌人钢铁
  　关振铃
    编者按：关振铃是北京市公安总队某营的炊事员，工人出身，只念过三年半书。在部队展开文化学习运动以后，他积极学习，提高了文化水平，并且写成了一部八万字的自传小说。这部小说描写了日本占领时期他在那里做工的制钢厂工人对敌斗争的情况。这里发表的就是其中的两节。
    高师傅
    制钢厂的东边空地上，建筑了一座平型炼钢炉。日本人说这炉建筑起来，每一炉可熔炼三十吨钢。一年多的时间，场房，炉座都修好了，就剩砌炉里和瓦斯通道内的耐火砖了。
    高师傅的手艺真不错，砌的又快又好，干起活来两人也跟不上。日本人很佩服他。他砌墙的地方，日本人一天也不准去一次，所以大家都愿意跟他在一起。每天早晨高师傅分工的时候，这个说：“高师傅我跟你去吧！”那个说：“我也跟你去吧！”舒杼才来没几天，也不知道是怎么回事。心想：“跟谁不是一样干活。”
    那天舒杼也幸运地被高师傅叫去和他干活。到了工地，叫他们抬了两趟耐火砖、三袋黏土就休息了。高师傅干活有一个特点：必须有一两个人给他站岗，见日本人一来就咳嗽。舒杼头一次跟高师傅干活，就叫坐在一堆砖的后面站岗。砖垛中间留了一个方洞，正对着从办公室到这来的通道。高师傅他们不砌砖，都坐在炉下的瓦斯室里说笑话。到中午快吃饭的时候，才从瓦斯燃烧室出来两个小工，把舒杼身边的红砖搬到不远一个大坑里，上面倒些脏土，又用脚踩了踩。舒杼心中很纳闷：为什么把挺好的耐火砖埋了，反到把坏砖送进瓦斯燃烧室呢？
    有一次，日本人来了，没等舒杼咳嗽，过来一个小工把他拉走，赶快抬砖去了。里边的瓦刀也叮叮当当乱响起来。日本人走来一看，原来的两大堆耐火砖快砌完了。他只扒着门往里看了看，就到别处去了。天天这样，舒杼也没敢问。
    砌炉里的时候，高师傅有他一套办法。本来砌这种耐高热的墙壁，需要一层红砖，一层钢砖，一层耐火砖，三层砖要一齐砌，如果砌不好，烧火时就从砖缝喷瓦斯，是很危险的。高师傅砌砖非常快，一眨眼就是两三层。有一次舒杼给他送泥，看见中间那层砖完全是碎的，而且没有码，他叫把泥倒在乱砖上，自己用抹刀一抹，上面紧跟着砌一层整齐的砖就完了。一天的活就这样干了多半。“这样砌行吗？”舒杼惊奇地问，“日本人看见怎么办？”高师傅说：“你别着急，有工夫我会告诉你的。”快到中午吃饭的时候，日本人拿着米突尺走进来，一量，今天上午砌了半米高，用手推了推砌好的砖，没推动，又很整齐，说了一声“顶好！”就回办公室去了。
    日本人每天在中午十二点到下午三点的时候，要睡两三个钟头的觉，工人们吃完饭，也找凉快的地方坐在一起聊大天。这天中午，瓦匠、小工四十多人坐在锅炉房里。舒杼靠着一扇门板，搬了几块砖坐在上面，两眼不时地瞅着直去办公室的通道，两只耳朵听着高师傅讲话：“日本人来的时候，我们不要惊慌，我怎么样，你们就怎么样！”他那向来爱笑的脸，这时也严肃起来了，接着又说：“你们知道我为什么砌的那样快吗？是因为我们是中国人！我们不能把钢铁交给敌人！让敌人去杀死我们的父母兄弟！凡是跟我在一起干过两天活的人都明白，不用细说。从明天起，都照着我那样做，管保错不了。我们要团结在一块，日本人再多些，我们也不怕，反正不能叫日本人顺利地炼出钢来”！舒杼打从心眼里爱听这些话。接着高师傅又讲了些从前工人在工会领导下，怎样向资本家斗争的故事。大家都听得直了眼。
    舒杼只顾听高师傅讲话，忘了瞅日本人，猛听见有脚步声，回头一看，“大刀”〔注〕已快走到门口，急忙咳嗽一声，假装没有看见。就听高师傅放大嗓门说：“一天准能砌八百块砖，……”“大刀”笑着走进屋来说：“高的顶好，你们谁的干活都不行。”高师傅没理“大刀”，继续说：“大家都照我说的去作，管保没错。”这天开会以后，大家干活谁也不觉累了。每天中午休息时，工人就围着高师傅听故事。日本人只当砌的速度加快了，那知道耐火砖都埋在大坑里！
    四个多月的时间，大家都跟高师傅亲亲热热的，像亲兄弟一样，一天不见就想。这几天日本人忙了，整天跑来跑去，就连厂长老中条也来看好几次。平炉工程已快完了，只剩一些零碎杂活。一船船的废铁、烟煤不断地往厂里卸，堆满了所有的空场。临时工增加了两倍，准备着在下星期一点火温炉，瓦斯炉也开始试火，鬼子们老等着从炉里流出屠杀中国人民的钢铁。
    星期一的早晨，快八点钟了，高师傅还没有来。
    “他病了吗？”舒杼心里想：“不能，星期六我们一块下工，他身体还很好。有事吗？今天是领粮领钱的日子，为什么不来呢？”这一天，大家都因高师傅没来干活显着没劲，就跟缺什么东西似的。日本人也找他，因为今天就要温炉，在瓦斯通道里还有一段耐火砖没有镟完，旁人镟，日本人不放心，怕镟不好会发生故障。
    直到下工，还不见高师傅来。舒杼下工后没回家，饿着肚子去找高师傅。离着他家老远，就看见高师傅站在门口，往这边望呢。“我就知道你们要来找我，快屋里坐吧！”舒杼进屋一愣：“你要搬家吗？夜里到那去？”“也许回东北，也许到宣化，不一定到那去，坐下吧，我还有话跟你说。”相处几个月，突然听说他要走，真有点舍不得。“你不走行吗？”“我应该走，我走的原因，再过三两天你们就会明白。可是我有一句话，要你牢牢记住：别忘记，咱们是中国人，不能叫日本人顺利地得到钢铁，拿着去屠杀中国人！只要大家团结在一起，什么困难都不怕。”半天，高师傅不再说话。舒杼知道他这时没有工夫，就站起来说：“那我就走了？”话没说完，不由得掉下眼泪。高师傅点了点头说：“好吧。”把头低下去，“再见”两个字也听不清了。
    温炉第三天，早晨九点多钟的时候，瓦斯炉里分煤的圆盘被火烧化了，厂长命令停火另换一个。等瓦斯炉二次运转时，就听“轰”的一声，在平炉底下干活的男女工人，都吓跑了。平炉底层，瓦斯燃烧室西墙壁的顶端，裂开了三寸长的大缝子，直往外冒火。日本人跑过去看了看，也摸不清是炉底被瓦斯气托起来，还是墙壁下沉，没有办法，只好临时用黏泥抹上，等炉烤干再说。
    不给敌人钢铁
    开炉的准备工作，完全搞好了。搬运工人把废钢铁抬到天车底下，再由天车起运到楼上。连铸钢锭的模子也全都码好了。日本人计划在今天夜间十二点，开始试炼第一炉钢。他们见了工人就说：“明天的，每个人五块钱的奖金，一定给！”下午用汽车接来一个日本和尚，升火时念了一段丧经。
    第二天早晨上班的时候，十几个日本人正围着瓦斯炉和平炉打转。夜班的工人眼都熬红了，累得走道也打幌。日本人“巴嘎巴嘎”地骂个不休。原来瓦斯炉烧出的瓦斯气，送不到炉内，日本人计划十二点钟试炉，到现在还没能达到目的，不得不停止瓦斯炉的运转，进行检查。费了半天时间，检查出瓦斯通道里面砌的砖，都一片片地塌下来，堵塞住钢管，瓦斯燃烧室里的墙也裂开了一条大缝，几乎要倒下来。日本人一个个气得面如姜黄，眼睛瞪得牛眼那么大，看着裂开的缝子发呆。不大工夫平炉主任左川两眼一直，如发疯一般，跳脚喊着说：“快把高的拿来！死了的给！”当时，“大刀”带着两个卫兵走了。舒杼和其他工人见到这种情形，彼此使了一个眼色，心里想：兔崽子！还想找高师傅吗，连影子也不会找到啦！
    不大工夫，“大刀”满头大汗跑回来，喘着气，脸也气白了，干用力说不出话来。好容易结结巴巴地说了一句：“高……高的跑啦！”左川一听高师傅跑了，马上说：“瓦匠统统的拿来！”事儿也凑巧，今天连一个瓦匠都没来，日本人到那里去找呢？看这样子，要打算炼出钢来，除非是从新翻工。
    舒杼把所有的小工，都叫到锅炉房里，对大家说：“砌的墙、镟的砖，倒的倒、塌的塌。日本人找不到高师傅和瓦匠，定然要拿我们出气，高师傅临走时对我说：‘咱们是中国人，不能叫日本人顺利地得到钢铁，拿着去屠杀中国人。’在这里，我们也不会有什么好处，不如来个不辞而别。娄庄子中山制铁厂快开工了，我那里认识一个姓王的技师，可以到那里找他。你们看怎样？”所有的人都回答说：“高师傅说的话错不了！我们全到制铁厂去，这里不管它。兔崽子日本人，让他们去转腰子吧！”
    〔注〕制钢厂的警卫长（日本人），每天手里提着一把大刀监视工人，工人给他取个绰号叫“大刀”。
