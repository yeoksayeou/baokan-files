Xinhua News Agency, 7th [dateline not specified]: Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Albania achieved significant successes in industrial and agricultural production in the first quarter of 1953. According to the recently published communiqués on the implementation of the national economic development plans for the first quarter of this year in these countries, Bulgaria completed 101.9 percent of its first-quarter industrial production plan, with the total industrial output increasing by 15 percent compared to the same period in 1952. Czechoslovakia completed 97.7 percent of its first-quarter industrial production plan, with total industrial output increasing by 9.8 percent compared to the same period last year, and heavy industrial output increasing by 14.1 percent. Albania's total industrial output increased by 12.6 percent compared to the same period last year. The production of some of Czechoslovakia's most important industrial products increased significantly compared to the first quarter of last year, such as milled iron increasing by 21 percent, hexagonal lathes increasing by two times, planers increasing by 60 percent, and buses and cars increasing by 2.6 times and 17 percent respectively. The production of steel, lignite, petroleum, automatic coal loaders, various types of cranes, and earth excavators all exceeded the planned targets. Bulgaria's steam boiler production increased by 67 percent compared to the same period last year, ore increased by 30 percent, and coal and electricity increased by 20 percent and 21 percent respectively. The light industrial output of these countries also increased significantly compared to the same period last year, with Bulgaria's cotton and wool textiles increasing by 22 percent, and Albania's cotton textiles increasing by 108 percent. In terms of industrial labor productivity, Czechoslovakia increased by 8.8 percent compared to the same period last year, and Bulgaria increased by 7 percent. In the first quarter, new production units in these countries commenced production. The No. 4 open-hearth furnace of the Gottwald Steel Plant, which is under construction in Czechoslovakia, has already started operation, and a newly built open-hearth furnace in the Molotov Metallurgical Plant has also started production.
    In agriculture, the spring sowing work in these countries in the first quarter was carried out better and faster than last year. The sowing work in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria has been completed, and Albania's sowing volume has increased by 11.2 percent compared to the same period last year. The sowing area in Bulgaria has been expanded, with the area planted with barley alone increasing by 32.1 percent. The smooth progress of spring sowing is inseparable from the continued development of agricultural collectivization and mechanization. By the end of the first quarter of this year, the number of advanced forms of unified agricultural production cooperatives in Czechoslovakia had increased to 6,800; agricultural cooperatives at all levels have also improved the level of economic management, improved farming equipment, and adopted advanced Soviet farming methods more widely. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in Bulgaria has also increased.
    With the further development of the national economy, the living standards of the working people continued to improve. The total retail trade volume in Bulgaria in the first quarter increased by 4.2 percent compared to the same period last year, with sales of meat products increasing by 27.9 percent and clothing sales increasing by 46.6 percent. Sales of flour products in state-owned and cooperative stores in Czechoslovakia increased by 11 percent compared to the first quarter of last year, and sales of fresh fruits increased by 8 percent. The trade volume of socialist economic components in Albania increased by 16.3 percent compared to the first quarter of last year, with sales of cotton textiles increasing by 107.5 percent.

    捷、保、阿第一季度工农业生产获重大成就
    【新华社七日讯】捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚一九五三年第一季度工农业生产取得了重大的成就。根据这些国家最近公布的今年第一季国民经济发展计划执行情况的公报，保加利亚的第一季工业生产计划完成了百分之一百零一点九，工业总产量比一九五二年同季增加了百分之十五。捷克斯洛伐克第一季工业生产计划完成了百分之九十七点七，工业总产量比去年同季增加了百分之九点八，重工业总产量增加了百分之十四点一。阿尔巴尼亚工业总产量比去年同季增加了百分之十二点六。捷克斯洛伐克最主要的一些工业品产量都比去年第一季增加很多，如铣铁增加了百分之二十一，六角车床增加了二倍，刨床增加了百分之六十，公共汽车和小汽车分别增加了二点六倍和百分之十七。钢材、褐煤、石油、自动装煤机、各式起重机和掘土机等的生产量都超额完成了计划。保加利亚的汽锅生产量比去年同季增加了百分之六十七，矿砂增加了百分之三十，煤和电力分别增加了百分之二十和百分之二十一。这些国家的轻工业生产量也比去年同季有了很大的增加，保加利亚的棉毛织品增加了百分之二十二，阿尔巴尼亚的棉织品增加了百分之一百零八。在工业劳动生产率方面，捷克斯洛伐克比去年同季提高了百分之八点八，保加利亚提高了百分之七。这些国家在第一季中又有新的生产单位开工生产，捷克斯洛伐克正在建筑中的哥特瓦尔德钢铁工厂的第四号平炉已经开工，莫洛托夫冶金工厂也有一座新建的平炉开工生产。
    在农业方面，这些国家第一季的春播工作都比去年进行得又好又快。捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚的播种工作已经结束，阿尔巴尼亚的播种量比去年同季增多了百分之十一点二。保加利亚的播种面积已扩大了，单是种植大麦的面积就增加了百分之三十二点一，春播工作的顺利进行是和农业合作化与机械化的继续发展分不开的。到今年第一季结束时为止，捷克斯洛伐克的高级形式的统一农业生产合作社已增至六千八百个；各级形式的农业合作社还提高了管理经济的水平，改进了耕作的设备，并更加广泛地采用了苏联的先进耕作方法。保加利亚的农业生产合作社的数目也有了增加。
    随着国民经济的进一步发展，劳动人民的生活水平继续提高。保加利亚第一季的零售贸易总额比去年同季增加了百分之四点二，其中肉类产品销售量增加了百分之二十七点九，服装销售量增加了百分之四十六点六。捷克斯洛伐克国营和合作社商店的面食品销售量比去年第一季增加了百分之十一，新鲜水果销售量增加了百分之八。阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义经济成分中的贸易额比去年第一季增加了百分之十六点三，其中棉织品销售量增加了百分之一百零七点五。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在第一季度获得了五千所新建的舒适的住宅。
