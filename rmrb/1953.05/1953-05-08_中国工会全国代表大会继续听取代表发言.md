Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions continued its sessions on the morning of the 7th. The executive chairmen of the congress were Che Xiangchen, Qiu Jin, Tang Guifen, Yang Chao, and Yang Zhenben.

    The delegates who spoke at the morning session on the 7th were Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, Li Zhaozhen, Deputy Director of the Branch of the Tianjin Clothing Factory and female labor model, Qiu Jin, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union, Saren, a Mongolian female tractor driver from the State-owned Chahayang Mechanical Farm in Heilongjiang Province, Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Yang Zhihua, Deputy Director of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Song Chuan, Deputy Director of the Working Committee of the Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Trade Union of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. They all agreed with and supported the reports of Lai Ruoyu, Xu Zhizhen, and Li Zaiwen, and expressed their determination to resolutely implement the policies and tasks formulated by the congress and strive to complete the task of national industrial construction.
    Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, reported on the significant achievements of railway workers under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, inheriting the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" struggle, in supporting the People's Liberation War, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, exchanging urban and rural materials, restoring the national economy, and consolidating national defense. He said that the railway trade union organized employees throughout the railway system to launch patriotic labor competitions, learn from Soviet advanced experiences, promote the advanced methods of the former China Changchun Railway, and initiate the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement. In the competition movement, labor productivity and transportation capacity have been significantly improved. For example, comparing 1952 with 1950, the ton-kilometers per operating personnel increased by 38.2%, the vehicle turnaround time was shortened, the number of tons of goods sent increased by 31%, the railway passenger and freight transport volume increased by 33.18%, and the transportation cost was reduced by 12.71%. The national transportation tasks were completed, a large amount of funds were accumulated for the country, and the construction of huge new lines began. On this basis, the living conditions of all employees have also gradually improved. Li Jiebo said excitedly that in these movements, countless model figures like Li Yong, Zheng Xikun, Li Xikui, Yang Maolin, Guo Shude, and Sun Xiaoju emerged; especially in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, tens of thousands of railway employees formed a steel-like transportation team and actively stepped onto the front line of justice to defend peace, and thousands of heroes represented by Fan Yong, Li Guoheng, Han Degui, Ning Zhizhi, and Zhang Baocheng emerged. This is the glory of the Chinese railway workers and the glory of the Chinese people. Li Jiebo said that in the new period of national construction, the task of railway transportation will inevitably be even more important, and improving railway transportation capacity will become the basic task of railway workers.
    Li Zhaozhen, Deputy Director of the Branch of the Tianjin Clothing Factory and special-class labor model of Tianjin, after reporting on the production achievements and improved living conditions of all workers in Tianjin, particularly mentioned the achievements of female workers in Tianjin in various movements. Like male workers, they ensured the timely completion of production tasks, and 90% of female workers participated in various studies, improving their political, cultural, and technical levels. She said that she herself was selected as a labor model and assumed the management work of state-owned enterprises under the cultivation and education of the Communist Party. She felt extremely honored and excited to be selected to attend the Second Congress of the International Textile and Garment Workers' Union in 1952.
      Qiu Jin, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union, reported to the conference on the great contributions of Chinese seamen in restoring and developing the motherland's shipping industry. Qiu Jin said that in the great Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, Chinese seamen eliminated the dependence of the Chinese shipping industry on imperialism, established an independent and autonomous shipping traffic system, and after arduous struggles against the plunder, bombing, blockade, and embargo by imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, learned advanced Soviet methods such as the single-row towing method, restored shipping traffic, and completed the national economic transportation and the transportation tasks to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. For example, the transportation volume of the Yangtze River in 1952 was equivalent to 156.6% of that in 1951. The transportation efficiency of ships has been greatly improved. Taking 1950 as 100, the transportation volume in 1952 was 630, ton-nautical miles were 1,408, and freight rates have been continuously reduced. On the basis of the restoration of shipping, the material and cultural life of seamen have been gradually improved. Qiu Jin said that the central task of the shipping industry this year is to carry out production reform in conjunction with the production competition movement, and further improve safety, sanitation, and various working conditions in this process.
    Saren, a female tractor driver from the State-owned Chahayang Mechanical Farm in Heilongjiang Province, used to be a Mongolian girl who grazed cattle for landlords. She felt extremely honored to be a female tractor driver in New China today and to participate in this conference. She said that in order to improve agricultural production and gradually mechanize agricultural production, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region sent her and another Mongolian girl, Suo Yaoerma, to the female tractor team of Liang Jun, a national labor model, to learn how to drive a tractor. She learned driving skills in six months and created a new record of sowing 4.63 hectares per hour. She said that for the sake of the country's industrialization and agricultural mechanization, she must study the reports made by Comrade Lai Ruoyu and others at this conference and convey the resolutions of the conference to workers throughout the province and female tractor drivers in the whole team, actively participate in labor competitions, and strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan.
    Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a speech on labor insurance work at the conference. Zhu Xuefan first pointed out that the implementation of the Chinese labor insurance system is the fruit of the revolutionary victory won by the Chinese working class under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the glorious victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. He said that the Chinese labor insurance system and the social insurance system of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, are basically of the same type, and are fundamentally different from those in capitalist countries. It is developed according to the principle of combining the actual needs of the working masses with the current conditions possible for the national economy.
    Zhu Xuefan said that the development of China's labor insurance cause is rapid. The implementation area has expanded from the Northeast to the whole country, and the scope of application has expanded from state-owned to private enterprises. The labor insurance funds directly paid by enterprise administrations account for about 8.66% of the total wages, and individual enterprises reach more than 15%. Taking 1949 as 100, the number of people enjoying labor insurance in 1952 was 490, an increase of four times compared with 1949.
    Zhu Xuefan said that the implementation of labor insurance has eliminated or reduced the concerns and difficulties in the lives of the employees that are most difficult and impossible to eliminate, reduced the diseases of the employees, improved the health of the employees, and guaranteed the attendance rate of the employees, thus improving the employees' political consciousness and production enthusiasm and greatly improving labor productivity.
    While pointing out the achievements and shortcomings of labor insurance work, Zhu Xuefan put forward five suggestions for improvement: First, trade union organizations at all levels should strengthen the political and ideological leadership of labor insurance work, and conduct publicity and education work in daily specific work so that the broad masses of employees can deeply understand the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government; second, labor insurance work is a mass work, and we must rely on, mobilize, and organize the masses of employees to do it together; third, we must actively pay attention to prevention in advance, and conduct it in close combination with labor protection work; fourth, the establishment of collective labor insurance undertakings should be based on the most urgent requirements of employees in various industries and regions, and pilot projects should be conducted with emphasis in combination with specific conditions in order to gain experience and gradually promote them; fifth, it is necessary to establish, improve, and strictly implement various labor insurance work systems and strengthen the planning of work.
    Zhu Xuefan finally pointed out that the continuous improvement of labor insurance benefits can only be realized on the material basis of developing production. The rapid development of China's labor insurance cause in the past four years and the achievements it has achieved fully prove that under the new democratic economic system, the interests of the working class are completely consistent with the interests of the country. Zhu Xuefan called on: let labor insurance work be oriented to production like other trade union work, and conduct it in close combination with production work, so as to effectively eliminate or reduce the difficulties in the lives of the broad masses of employees, so that they can fully exert their creativity and enthusiasm, and strive to ensure the completion and strive to complete the national plan ahead of schedule and transition to the socialist future.
    Yang Zhihua, Deputy Director of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the work of female workers and the work of employees' families at the conference. She said that in the past four years, female workers, like male workers, have played a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity on the production front, and more than 16,000 female labor models and more than 13,600 female model workers have emerged, and more than 18,000 cadres have been promoted from female workers. Under their leadership, the broad masses of female workers have made great contributions to the cause of national economic construction. A large number of activists have also emerged in the families of employees, who have led all organized family women and played a great role in assisting employees in completing production tasks. Yang Zhihua said that the special interests of female workers have been protected by the state. In the year after the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the expenditure on maternity subsidies alone reached more than 7.844 billion yuan. The number of nurseries in factories and mines across the country has also greatly increased. The number of illiterates among female workers and employees' families is also gradually decreasing. Yang Zhihua said that these achievements are inseparable from the Chinese Communist Party's long-term concern for the cause of women's liberation. The masses of female workers have not disappointed the expectations of the Party. In the textile industry, where female workers account for the majority, the national production plan has been completed and overfulfilled in the past few years and has been rewarded by the state; many female workers have mastered complex production technologies and have moved from light industrial departments to heavy industry, transportation, and basic construction departments, and have successfully completed the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the state like men. Yang Zhihua finally summarized the experiences and lessons of the work of female workers and employees' families in the past four years, and put forward the direction of future efforts.
    Song Chuan, Deputy Director of the Working Committee of the Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Trade Union of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that after the national liberation, the political consciousness of agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy workers has been greatly improved. At present, more than 50% of employees have joined the trade union, and in some places, the number of members has reached 70%. Agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy workers have achieved great achievements in production. In agriculture, more than 2,000 typical experimental state-owned farms have been established across the country, becoming advanced banners in agricultural production. In the ten state-owned mechanical farms in the Northeast, due to the promotion of advanced Soviet experience, the average yield of spring wheat per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) was twice as high as the local yield, and the yield of the 93rd Farm was three times as high as the local yield. In forestry, the logging efficiency has been increased by 100% compared with the past, and the stump has been reduced from 70 cm to less than 5 cm. In the past, it took at least half a year to transport wood to the edging yard, but now it can be transported to the storage yard in ten days. The seasonal logging in the past has moved towards year-round operation, thus accelerating the turnover of funds and reducing costs. In terms of water conservancy, as of now, water conservancy projects have completed a total of 2.36 billion cubic meters of earthwork, equivalent to the earthwork completed by thirteen Panama Canals and thirty-two Suez Canals. This guarantees the safety of agricultural production and people's lives in vast areas. The material and cultural life of agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy workers has also been improved. The average wage of workers in 1952 increased by an average of 100% compared with 1949.
    The speeches of representatives such as Li Jiebo were warmly welcomed by the audience.
    At the morning session on the 7th, K.M. Ivanov, Head of the Bulgarian Trade Union Delegation and Secretary of the Central Council of Bulgarian Trade Unions, Gerald Dawson, Head of the Australian Trade Union Delegation and Member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Jasuria, Chairman of the Central Railway Trade Union of India, delivered speeches to the conference successively. They all expressed congratulations to the conference, celebrated the brilliant achievements of New China in all aspects, and paid tribute to the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. Their speeches were warmly applauded by the audience.
    K.M. Ivanov, Head of the Bulgarian Trade Union Delegation and Secretary of the Central Council of Bulgarian Trade Unions, said that all the achievements made by the Chinese people in construction, as well as every victory on the Korean battlefield, are also the achievements and victories of the Bulgarian people. These achievements and victories inspire the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarian people have now resolutely entered the period of socialist construction. The first Dimitrov Five-Year Plan has been basically completed in four years. Dozens of enterprises have completed their production tasks in less than four years. The total industrial output in 1952 exceeded three times that of the pre-war year of 1939. Nearly 60% of the arable land area's farmers have joined labor production cooperatives. In 1952, the mechanization of agriculture exceeded the level stipulated in the National Economic Five-Year Plan. In 1952, the national income increased by 100% compared with 1939, and will increase by 36% in 1953 compared with 1952. In 1953, the second Five-Year Plan will be implemented. According to the plan, industrial products in 1953 will increase by 16% compared with 1952. He said that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the Bulgarian people are firmly advancing along the road of the great Soviet Union, and are increasingly consolidating the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet people, the people of various people's democratic countries, and the unbreakable friendship with all peace-loving and democratic people in the world.
    Gerald Dawson, Head of the Australian Trade Union Delegation, said that the participation of the Australian Trade Union Delegation in this conference will definitely strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the working classes of China and Australia, and will help the cause of world peace. He said that after returning, the Australian trade union representatives will unite all peace-loving people and strive to resolve all international disputes through peaceful negotiations. Gerald Dawson said that all good people should come together to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs, the immediate reduction of armaments, and the signing of a peace treaty by the five major powers. He said that the Chinese people's contribution to the cause of world peace has inspired the Australian people. Australian industrial workers have taken action to strengthen the unity of all aspects of the workers' movement in order to combat war profiteers. The representatives of the Australian trade union unanimously guaranteed to be loyal to the cause of promoting friendly cooperation between countries and establishing world peace.
    Jasuria, Chairman of the Central Railway Trade Union of India, said that the convening of this conference is of historical significance to people in any part of the world. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people have done many things that have shaken the world in the past few years. He introduced the heroic struggle of the peasants of Telangana, India. Jasuria strongly condemned the attempt of U.S. imperialism to establish world hegemony. He said that the proposition of unity among the Asian people and the people of the world will never be subdued by atomic bombs, guns, and hangings. He said that the development of the socialist economy requires peace. Conversely, monopoly capitalists can only make money from war bloodshed. The greatest desire of the people of the world is peace, so that our descendants can live a human life without the threat of war.
    At the morning session, the Bulgarian Trade Union Delegation and the Australian Trade Union Delegation presented flags and gifts to the conference in lasting applause, which were accepted by Zhu Xuefan and Liu Ningyi on behalf of the conference.
    Before the adjournment of the morning session, Prama Nik, member of the Presidium of the All-India Trade Union Congress, read out a congratulatory letter from Bose, secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, at the conference. The audience responded with warm applause.
    The conference adjourned at 12:00 noon.
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions continued to hold a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 7th. The executive chairmen were Zhu Xuefan, Lai Ruoyu, Yang Zhihua, He Yingcai, and Zhou Chuandian.
    At the invitation of the presidium of the conference, Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, gave a report to the representatives on the situation of Chinese industry at the afternoon session.
    Jia Tuofu first reported on the recovery and development of the national economy. He said that as of 1952, in terms of industrial production: except for raw coal, other major products such as pig iron, steel, steel, electricity, crude oil, electrolytic copper, soda ash, caustic soda, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, sugar, etc., have exceeded the highest annual output in Chinese history. In terms of agricultural production, the national grain output in 1952 reached 163.75 million tons, exceeding the highest annual output in history; the national cotton output reached 1.29 million tons, exceeding the highest annual output in history by about 50%; and other technical crops have also increased. In terms of trade and transportation: in 1952, foreign trade imports and exports were balanced; railway freight turnover increased by 48% compared with the highest level in history. The national financial budget has been balanced. The national market is stable, and prices have been reduced in a planned manner; employees' wages and benefits have increased greatly, people's purchasing power has increased greatly, and people's lives have gradually improved.
    Jia Tuofu said that the results of the recovery and development of China's economy have made it not only necessary but also possible to develop China's industry in a planned manner and lead the entire national economy to gradually move onto the track of national planning.
    Regarding China's new construction tasks, Jia Tuofu said that the great goal of China's new construction is to "transform an agricultural country into an industrial country." Therefore, the basic task of China's first five-year plan is to concentrate efforts on the construction of heavy industry, lay the foundation for national industrialization, and ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy.
    Jia Tuofu said that during China's first five-year plan period, China's industry will have great development. The total output value of industrial production in 1953 alone will increase by about 23% compared with 1952, of which state-owned industry will increase by about 32%.
    Jia Tuofu said that in the development of China's industry, there are indeed many difficulties. If we ignore the difficulties, we will make the mistake of being impatient and rash, and may bring greater difficulties and harm to the cause of national construction. However, whether from a domestic or foreign perspective, or from a political or economic perspective, we have many extremely favorable conditions, and these favorable conditions are the basic aspects. It is believed that the working class and all the people of the country will bravely overcome all difficulties and make China steadily embark on the broad road of socialism.
    Jia Tuofu then pointed out some problems existing in the management of state-owned factories and mines. He said that in order to solve these problems and overcome shortcomings, state-owned factories and mines should pay special attention to establishing and strengthening planning management, establishing and improving the responsibility system, vigorously advocating learning from the Soviet Union and promoting advanced experience, and gradually implementing a strict economic accounting system. In addition, we should also vigorously strengthen the exploration of underground resources, continue to improve design organizations and strengthen design forces, make every effort to utilize existing equipment, adjust the capabilities of the existing machinery industry, and train and cultivate technical personnel and skilled workers in a planned and large-scale manner to meet the needs of long-term construction.
    Jia Tuofu emphasized in the final part of his report that strengthening the leadership and supervision of the Communist Party over state-owned factories and mines and strengthening ideological and political work in industrial work are of decisive significance for improving the level of industrial management work. In the management of state-owned industry, we must continue to implement the principle of combining political work with economic work; we must rely on the masses to do a good job in all work in state-owned industry.
    The report by Deputy Director Jia Tuofu was warmly welcomed by all the representatives.
    After the report by Deputy Director Jia Tuofu, the representatives of the conference continued to speak.
    Those who spoke at the afternoon session were Yang Chao, Deputy Director of the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, He Yingcai, First Deputy Director of the Central South Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Qi Tinghan, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Northeast 53 Factory, Gao Fengqin, Member of the Family Committee of the 724 Factory, Zhu Fadi, Deputy Director of the Workshop of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and labor model, Peng Songfu, turning instructor of the technical training class of the 203 Factory and labor model, etc. They all agreed with the reports of Lai Ruoyu, Xu Zhizhen, and Li Zaiwen at the conference and expressed their determination to work hard to realize the policies and tasks formulated by the conference.
    Yang Chao, Deputy Director of the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the Southwest region was liberated later. At that time, some factories and mines were destroyed by the enemy, and transportation had not yet recovered. Under such extremely difficult circumstances, the workers in the Southwest region still quickly restored production order. After the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project started in 1950, the production enthusiasm of employees was further enhanced, and trade union work achieved great success. Now, more than 80% of the employees in the seven industries of hardware smelting, machinery, textiles, and railways in the whole region have been organized, and more than 13,500 labor models and model workers have emerged, 849 advanced groups, and more than 14,000 workers have been trained and promoted to technical personnel and management cadres. With the restoration and development of production, the labor conditions and living conditions of employees have also been continuously improved. Yang Chao said that in order to complete the glorious task of the national first five-year construction plan, all employees in the Southwest region are determined to work together with other advanced regions to further do their own work well.
    He Yingcai, First Deputy Director of the Central South Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, introduced in his speech that all employees in the Central South region had made great achievements in restoring the national economy, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and reforming factories and mines. He said that in 1952, the total production value of the Central South region had increased by 400% compared with 1949, employees in more than 1,100 units participated in labor competitions, put forward more than 12,000 rationalization proposals, and 29,004 labor models emerged. The trade union also transferred more than 34,600 cadres to work in factory administration and government agencies. The living conditions of workers have also been considerably improved. He Yingcai said that although the trade union work in the Central South region has achieved many achievements, there are still many shortcomings, especially the leadership work is not deep and solid enough, and criticism and self-criticism have not become a regular system. These shortcomings must be seriously overcome in future work.
    Qi Tinghan, Chairman of the Trade Union of the nationally famous model factory - the 53 Factory, reported at the meeting that their factory has implemented the basic policy of relying on the working class to run people's enterprises well in the past four years. Under the unified leadership of the factory party organization, the party organization, the factory administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League have unified their thinking, acted in unison, combined political work with economic work, learned from advanced Soviet experience, and consolidated the lasting competition combining labor and technology through collective contracts, ensuring the comprehensive and overfulfilled completion of the national plan year by year. On this basis, the material and cultural life of the employees has been improved. Due to these great achievements and the important experiences they have created, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have awarded the factory the glorious title of "Model Factory." Qi Tinghan expressed to the conference that they will also overcome the shortcomings existing in their work in the future, continue to deepen the patriotic labor competition, further learn from advanced Soviet experience, ensure to improve the product qualification rate by 0.5%, reduce costs by 4%, and comprehensively complete the annual national plan one month ahead of schedule in 1953, laying a victorious foundation for completing the first five-year construction plan.
    Gao Fengqin, Member of the Family Committee of the 724 Factory, introduced in her speech with vivid examples the great achievements of the family work in their factory. She said that now their workers' residential area has become a big family of mutual assistance and love, and families have been organized. Everyone cares about the production in the factory. In the group where Gao Fengqin is located, thirteen children were born in eight months, which did not affect the attendance rate of the men. The whole area has achieved eight cleanlinesses - the kitchen, toilet, bathroom, bedroom, bedding, body, clothes, and the outside of the house are all clean; and five eliminations - bedbugs, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and rats are all gone. Patriotic covenants and couple covenants have been generally concluded there, and checked once a week. Whenever something happens, all 1,800 children in the entire residential area are taken care of by temporary nurseries. As men and women progress together, the enthusiasm for improving production has come. After the family members' thoughts and culture have improved, they have become the reserve army for production. Two hundred and fifty outstanding family members in the factory have participated in production. Gao Fengqin said excitedly: "The old life will never come back. We have created a new life. We will never forget the care and help of the Communist Party and the trade union." She said: "We must work even harder to make the family a force to promote production. We must have higher production and a better life, and let employees and their families mobilize together to fight for national industrialization and a better life!"
    Zhu Fadi, Deputy Director of the Workshop of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and labor model, has been a weaving worker in the factory for seventeen years. In her speech, she described the pain she suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation. At that time, she gave birth to eight children and seven of them died. After liberation, she realized that she had become the master of the country, so she actively produced and won the Red Flag Award fourteen times in a row. Because she did not produce secondary cloth and bad cloth, she was also selected as a Shanghai labor model and attended the summary meeting of the
    "1951 Weaving Work Method." After she came back from the meeting, she taught many Shanghai weaving workers to learn this advanced work method. She said that after participating in this conference, she more clearly recognized the direction she should work hard in the future. When she goes back, she will definitely mobilize everyone to do a good job in production and strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan.
    Peng Songfu, turning instructor of the technical training class of the 203 Factory and labor model, reported at the meeting the process of his creating a rapid teaching method for the basic technology of turning.
    At the afternoon session on the 7th, Diallo Seydou, Secretary-General of the Dakar Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union of French West Africa, Mewoa Beck, Secretary of the Liaison Committee of Trade Unions of French Equatorial Africa and Cameroon, and Ali Gujeh Mohammed, Secretary of the Agricultural and Forestry Workers' Trade Union of Algeria and Executive Committee Member of the Algerian Trade Union Liaison Committee, delivered speeches to the conference successively. They congratulated the conference, celebrated the achievements of the Chinese people, and congratulated the great unity of the people of the world. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the audience.
    Diallo Seydou, Secretary-General of the Dakar Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union of French West Africa, on behalf of the black African workers who are fighting for independence, paid brotherly respect and most sincere blessings to the glorious Chinese people. He said enthusiastically: For the people in African colonies, the victorious Chinese people are an example for them to strive for liberation and an encouragement to them. The brilliant history of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a historical example that the entire African people admire and study with concern. The name of the genius Mao Zedong echoes loudly at the end of the African forest.
    After describing the brutal crimes of the colonialists and the tragic situation of African workers, Diallo Seydou talked about their struggle with confidence. Diallo Seydou said that African workers, with the unremitting support of their elder brother, the French General Confederation of Labor, are moving from victory to victory and improving their living conditions. Even in the most remote areas of Africa, there are strikes and mass demonstrations against colonial rulers everywhere. Neither colonial beatings nor violent imprisonment can stop the African people from moving towards complete liberation.
    Mewoa Beck, Secretary of the Liaison Committee of Trade Unions of French Equatorial Africa and Cameroon, reported at the conference on the colonial enslavement suffered by the African people and the heroic struggle of the African people for national liberation. Mewoa Beck said that the imperialists have turned Africa into a strategic base and a paradise where they can freely exploit. The colonial authorities in Africa implement a policy of division and racial discrimination among African residents. They suppress the resistance of the African people by means of unjustified arrests, forced labor, and imprisonment. The lives of the African people have fallen into extreme poverty. In the slums, dampness, dirt, disease, and death occur constantly. Unemployment is rampant everywhere. Ninety percent of the African people are illiterate. There is only one hospital for 150,000 residents. He said that although African workers have suffered a series of poverty, suppression, and persecution by colonialists, they are still constantly struggling. The large-scale strike of French West African workers on November 3, 1952, achieved a great victory, which is a victory for the working class around the world that shook the foundations of international capitalism. Finally, he said that the issue of peace is a matter of concern to the whole world, especially the colonial people. The colonial people are uniting more closely to fight against war and strive for freedom and national independence.
    Ali Gujeh Mohammed, Secretary of the Agricultural and Forestry Workers' Trade Union of Algeria and Executive Committee Member of the Algerian Trade Union Liaison Committee, reported at the conference on the tragic situation of the African and Algerian people. He said that in Algeria, 500,000 small farmers only own 2.5 million hectares of land, while 13,000 local landlords own 3.3 million hectares of the most fertile arable land. Nine hundred European landlords occupy about one million hectares of land. In six years, 119 colonial companies plundered profits of 60.319 billion francs in Algeria. The income of the Algerian working people is extremely low, the sanitary conditions are extremely poor, and 90% of the people are illiterate. In Algeria, the patriotic people who have been arrested, if the years of imprisonment are added together, reach 955 years and four months, the total amount of fines is 19.796 million francs, the time of control is 570 years, and the time of deprivation of civil rights is 1,210 years. The Algerian working people have carried out dozens of strikes, large and small, in recent years, and have achieved significant achievements. The Algerian people have also become more united in the actual struggle. They are moving forward on the road of liberation.
    He Yingcai, the executive chairman of the conference, extended a warm welcome to the speeches of the three African trade union representatives on behalf of the conference, expressed deep sympathy for the suffering of the African people, and expressed support for their heroic struggle.
    At the afternoon session, the Algerian trade union representative presented a flag to the conference amid warm applause.
    Dong Xin, Deputy Secretary-General of the conference, announced at the conference that a total of 1,260 congratulatory telegrams and letters had been received from home and abroad, and read out the congratulatory letter from the Pakistan Federation of Trade Unions to the conference.
    The conference adjourned at 6:10 p.m.

    在七日上午大会上发言的代表，有中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯，天津被服厂分厂副主任、女劳动模范李兆珍，中国海员工会筹备委员会副主任丘金，黑龙江省国营查哈阳机械农场女拖拉机手、蒙古族的萨仁，中华全国总工会副主席朱学范，中华全国总工会女工部副部长杨之华，中华全国总工会农林水利工会工作委员会副主任宋川。他们一致同意和拥护赖若愚、许之桢和栗再温的报告，并表示要坚决执行大会所制定的方针和任务，为完成国家工业建设的任务而奋斗。
    中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯，报告了铁路工人在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，继承“二七”斗争的光荣传统，在支援人民解放战争、抗美援朝战争，在交流城乡物资，恢复国民经济，巩固国防等方面的重大成就。他说，铁路工会组织全路员工开展爱国劳动竞赛，学习了苏联先进经验，推广了原中国长春铁路的先进方法，发起了满载、超轴、五百公里运动。在竞赛运动中，劳动生产率和运输能力都显著提高了。如以一九五二年和一九五○年比较，每一运营人员千吨公里提高了百分之三十八点二，车辆周转时间缩短，货物发送吨数提高了百分之三十一，铁路客货运输生产量增加了百分之三十三点一八，运输成本降低了百分之十二点七一。完成了国家运输任务，为国家积累了大量资金，开始进行了巨大的新线建设工程。在这一基础上，全路职工的生活状况也逐步改善了。李颉伯兴奋地说，在这些运动中，出现了无数像李永、郑锡坤、李锡奎、杨茂林、郭树德、孙孝菊一样的模范人物；特别是在抗美援朝运动中，数万铁路员工组成钢铁般的运输队伍，积极地走上了正义的、保卫和平的前线，涌现出以范永、李国珩、韩德贵、宁吉芝、张宝成等为代表的成千上万的英雄人物。这是中国铁路工人的光荣，也是中国人民的光荣。李颉伯说，在国家建设的新时期，铁路运输的任务必更加重大，而提高铁路运输能力，就成为铁路工人的基本任务。
    天津被服厂分厂副主任、天津市特等劳动模范李兆珍，在代表天津市全体工人报告了他们的生产成就和生活改善的情况以后，特别提到天津市女工在各个运动中的成就。她们和男工一样保证了生产任务的按时完成，并且有百分之九十的女工参加了各种学习，提高了自己的政治、文化、技术水平。她说，她自己就在共产党的培养教育下，被选为劳动模范，并担负了国家企业的管理工作。她对一九五二年被选派出席纺织服装工人工会国际第二次代表大会，感到万分的光荣和兴奋。
      中国海员工会筹备委员会副主任丘金，向大会报告了中国海员工人在恢复和发展祖国航运事业中的巨大贡献。丘金说，中国的海员工人在伟大的中国人民革命斗争中，清除了中国轮船航运事业对帝国主义的依赖，树立了独立自主的航运交通系统，并经过与帝国主义、蒋介石残余匪帮的劫夺、轰炸、封锁禁运进行艰苦的斗争，学习了苏联先进的一列式拖带法等经验，恢复了航运交通，完成了国家经济运输与支援抗美援朝斗争的运输任务。例如，一九五二年长江的运输量，即相当于一九五一年百分之一百五十六点六。船只运输效率已大大提高，以一九五○年为一百，一九五二年运量为六百三十，吨浬为一千四百零八，运价已不断下降。在恢复航运的基础上，海员的物质生活与文化生活得到逐渐改善。丘金说，今年航运事业的中心工作，是结合生产竞赛运动进行生产改革工作，并在这一过程中进一步改善安全卫生和各种工作条件。
    黑龙江省国营查哈阳机械农场女拖拉机手萨仁，过去是一个给地主放牛的蒙族女孩子，她对今天能成为新中国的女拖拉机手，并且参加这次大会，感到无上光荣。她说，内蒙古自治区人民政府为了提高农业生产，使农业生产逐渐走向机械化道路，派她和另一位蒙族姑娘索耀尔玛到全国劳动模范梁军女拖拉机队学习开拖拉机。她在六个月内学会了驾驶技术，并且创造了每小时播种四点六三公顷的新纪录。她表示，为了祖国工业化和农业机械化，一定很好学习赖若愚同志等在这次大会上所作的报告，并把大会的决议传达给全省工人和全队女拖拉机手，积极参加劳动竞赛，为完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
    中华全国总工会副主席朱学范，在大会作了关于劳动保险工作的发言。朱学范首先指出：中国劳动保险制度的实施，是中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下所获得的革命胜利果实，是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。他说，中国劳动保险制度与社会主义国家苏联的社会保险制度基本上属于同一类型，与资本主义国家有着根本的不同。它是根据工人群众实际需要与目前国家经济可能的条件相结合的方针发展起来的。
    朱学范说，中国劳动保险事业的发展是迅速的，实施地区从东北推动到全国，适用范围从国营到私营企业，连企业行政直接支付的劳动保险经费约共占工资总额的百分之八点六六，个别企业达百分之十五以上。享受劳动保险的人数以一九四九年为一百，一九五二年为四百九十，比一九四九年增加了四倍。
    朱学范说，劳动保险的实施，解除或减轻了职工群众生活中最感困难而无法解除的顾虑和困难，减少了职工的疾病，增进了职工的健康，保证了职工的出勤率，因而提高了职工的政治觉悟和生产积极性，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    朱学范在指出劳动保险工作的成绩和缺点时，提出了五项改进意见：第一、各级工会组织要加强劳动保险工作的政治领导与思想领导，在日常具体工作中经常进行宣传教育工作，使广大职工群众深刻体会到共产党和人民政府的关怀；第二、劳动保险工作是一件群众性工作，要依靠、发动和组织职工群众一起来作；第三、要积极地注意事先预防，要与劳动保护工作密切地结合起来进行；第四、举办集体劳动保险事业，要根据各产业、各地区职工群众最迫切的要求，结合具体条件有重点地试办，以便取得经验逐步推动；第五、要建立、健全并严格贯彻执行各种劳动保险工作制度，加强工作的计划。
    朱学范最后指出劳动保险待遇的不断提高，只有在发展生产的物质基础上才有实现的可能。四年来中国劳动保险事业的迅速发展及其所获得的成绩，充分证明了在新民主主义经济制度下，工人阶级的利益与国家利益是完全一致的。朱学范号召：把劳动保险工作与其他工会工作一样地面向生产，与生产工作密切结合进行，以切实解除或减轻广大职工生活上的困难，使他们充分发挥创造性与积极性，为保证完成与争取提前超额完成国家计划、并过渡到社会主义的前途而努力。
    中华全国总工会女工部副部长杨之华，在大会上报告了工会女工工作和职工家属工作的情况。她说，四年来女工群众和男工一样，在生产战线上发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，出现了女工劳动模范一万六千多人，女模范工作者一万三千六百多人，由女工提升的干部一万八千多人。在她们带动下，广大女工群众对国家经济建设事业贡献了极大的力量。在职工家属中也出现了大批积极分子，她们带动全体有组织的家属妇女，在协助职工完成生产任务方面也发挥了很大作用。杨之华说，女工的特殊利益受到了国家的保护，在劳动保险条例颁布后的一年中，仅生育补助费的开支就达到了七十八亿四千四百多万元。全国厂矿托儿所也有很大发展。女工和职工家属中的文盲也在逐步减少。杨之华说，这些成就与中国共产党长期关心妇女解放事业是分不开的。女工群众也没有辜负党的期望，在女工占多数的纺织业，几年来都完成和超额完成了国家生产计划，受到了国家的奖励；不少女工已掌握了复杂的生产技术，从轻工业部门走到重工业、交通运输和基本建设部门，和男子一样地胜利完成了党和国家交给她们的任务。杨之华最后总结了四年来女工和职工家属工作的经验教训，并提出了今后努力的方向。
    中华全国总工会农林水利工会工作委员会副主任宋川说，全国解放后，农林水利工人的政治觉悟大大提高。目前百分之五十多的职工参加了工会，有的地方，会员已达百分之七十。农林水利工人在生产中获得了很大的成绩。农业方面，全国创办了两千多个典型试验性质的国营农场，成为农业生产上的先进旗帜。东北十个国营机械农场，由于推广了苏联先进经验，每垧（等于十五市亩）地春麦的平均产量高出当地产量的一倍，九三农场的产量高出当地产量的三倍。在林业方面，采伐效率已比过去提高百分之百，伐根由七十公分降到五公分以下。过去运材最快要半年才能运到楞场，现在十天即可运到贮场。过去季节性的伐木已走向长年作业，因而加速了资金的周转，降低了成本。水利事业方面，截至目前止，水利工程共完成了二十三点六亿立方公尺的土方，相当于十三条巴拿马运河，三十二条苏彝士运河所完成的土方。这保证了广大地区的农业生产和人民生活的安全。农林水利业工人的物质和文化生活也得到了改善和提高。工人工资一九五二年比一九四九年平均增加了一倍。
    李颉伯等代表的发言，受到全场热烈欢迎。
    在七日上午大会上，保加利亚工会代表团团长、保加利亚工会中央理事会书记克·麦·伊凡诺夫，澳大利亚工会代表团团长、澳大利亚工会理事会理事杰拉德·道逊，印度中部铁路工会主席贾苏里亚，相继向大会致辞。他们都向大会表示祝贺，庆贺新中国在各方面的辉煌成就，并向中国工人阶级和中国人民致敬。他们的发言，受到全场热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    保加利亚工会代表团团长、保加利亚工会中央理 事会书记克·麦·伊凡诺夫说，中国人民在建设中所获得的一切成就，以及在朝鲜战场上的每一胜利，也同样是保加利亚人民的成就和胜利。这些成就和胜利鼓舞着保加利亚人民。保加利亚人民现在已坚决地进入了社会主义的建设时期。第一个季米特洛夫五年计划已基本上在四年内完成。有数十个企业还不到四年就完成了生产任务。一九五二年工业总产量已超过战前一九三九年的三倍。将近百分之六十耕地面积的农民都加入了劳动生产合作社。一九五二年，农业的机械化已超过国民经济五年计划所规定的水平。一九五二年国民的收入比一九三九年增加了一倍，一九五三年还要比一九五二年增加百分之三十六。一九五三年实行第二个五年计划，根据计划，一九五三年的工业产品将比一九五二年提高百分之十六。他说，保加利亚人民在英明的共产党领导下，正坚定地沿着伟大苏联的道路前进，日益巩固与苏联人民的牢不可破的友谊，与各人民民主国家的人民和全世界一切爱好和平、民主人民的牢不可破的友谊。
    澳大利亚工会代表团团长杰拉德·道逊说，澳大利亚工会代表团参加这次大会，一定会加强中、澳两国工人阶级的友好与合作，并有助于世界和平的事业。他说，澳大利亚工会代表们回去后，将团结一切爱好和平的人，争取以和平谈判的方式来解决一切国际纠纷。杰拉德·道逊说，所有善良的人都应集合起来，要求禁止原子弹、立即裁减军备和签订五大国和平公约。他说，中国人民对于世界和平事业的贡献鼓舞了澳大利亚人民。澳大利亚产业工人已经行动起来，努力加强工人运动各方面的团结，以打击战争获利者。澳大利亚工会的代表，一致保证忠实于促进各国间友好合作和建立世界和平的事业。
    印度中部铁路工会主席贾苏里亚说，这次大会的召开，对世界任何一部分的人都有历史意义。中国工人阶级和中国人民，在这几年内做了许多震撼世界的事情。他介绍了印度特仑甘那农民的英勇斗争。贾苏里亚有力地谴责美帝国主义建立世界霸权的企图。他说，亚洲人民和全世界人民团结的主张，永远不会被原子弹、枪炮和吊刑所压服。他说，社会主义经济的发展需要和平，相反的，垄断资本家只有从战争流血中才能发财。全世界人民最大的愿望是和平，以使我们的后代，可以过着人的生活，而再也没有战争的威胁。

    【新华社七日讯】中国工会第七次全国代表大会七日下午继续举行全体会议。执行主席是朱学范、赖若愚、杨之华、何英才、周传典。
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任贾拓夫，应大会主席团的邀请，在下午大会上向代表们作了关于中国工业情况的报告。
    贾拓夫首先报告了全国经济恢复和发展的情况。他说，至一九五二年为止，在工业生产方面：主要产品除原煤以外，其他如生铁、钢、钢材、电力、原油、电铜、纯碱、烧碱、水泥、棉纱、棉布、纸、糖等，都已超过我国历史上最高年产量。在农业生产方面，一九五二年全国粮食产量已达一亿六千三百七十五万吨，超过了历史上最高年产量；全国棉花产量已达一百二十九万吨，约超过历史上最高年产量百分之五十左右；其他技术作物也有增加。在贸易和交通运输等方面：一九五二年国外贸易出入口已经平衡；铁路货运周转量比历史上最高水平增加百分之四十八。国家财政预算已经平衡。全国市场稳定，物价已有计划地予以降低；职工工资和福利已有很大增长，人民购买力已有很大提高，人民生活已逐步有所改善。
    贾拓夫说，我国经济的恢复和发展的结果，使我国不但有必要、而且已有可能来有计划地发展我国的工业，并领导全部国民经济逐步走向国家计划的轨道。
    关于我国新的建设任务，贾拓夫说，我国新的建设的伟大目标，就是要“变农业国为工业国”。因此，我国第一个五年计划的基本任务，在于集中力量进行重工业的建设，为国家工业化建立基础，并保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步地增长。
    贾拓夫说，在我国第一个五年计划期内，我国的工业将有巨大的发展。仅一九五三年工业生产的总产值比一九五二年将增长百分之二十三左右，其中国营工业将增长百分之三十二左右。
    贾拓夫说，在发展我国的工业当中，我们是存在着不少困难的。如果我们忽视困难，就要犯急躁冒进的错误，并且可能给国家建设事业带来更大的困难和危害。但是，不论从国内和国外来看，从政治上和经济上来看，我们有许多极为有利的条件，而且这些有利条件是基本的方面。相信全国工人阶级和全体人民一道，将勇敢地克服一切困难，使我国稳步地走向社会主义的大道。
    贾拓夫接着指出了目前国营厂矿企业管理工作中存在的一些问题。他说，为了解决这些问题和克服缺点，目前国营厂矿企业应特别注意建立与加强计划管理，建立与健全责任制度，大力提倡学习苏联和推广先进经验，逐步实行严格的经济核算制度。此外，还应大力加强地下资源的勘探工作，继续健全设计组织和壮大设计力量，尽一切可能利用现有的设备，调整现有机械工业的能力，并有计划地大量地训练和培养技术人员和熟练工人，以适应长期建设的需要。
    贾拓夫在报告的最后强调说，加强共产党对国营厂矿的领导和监督，加强工业工作中的思想政治工作，对提高工业管理工作的水平有着决定的意义。在国营工业管理工作中，必须继续贯彻政治工作和经济工作相结合的原则；必须依靠群众，来办好国营工业中的一切工作。
    贾拓夫副主任的报告，受到全体代表热烈欢迎。
    在贾拓夫副主任报告以后，大会代表继续发言。
    在下午大会上发言的，有中华全国总工会西南办事处副主任杨超，中华全国总工会中南工作委员会第一副主任何英才，东北五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉，七二四厂职工家属委员会委员高凤琴，国营上海第一棉纺织厂车间副主任、劳动模范朱发弟，二○三厂技工训练班车工指导员、劳动模范彭松福等。他们一致同意赖若愚、许之桢和栗再温在大会上的报告，并表示将坚决为实现大会所制定的方针任务而努力。
    中华全国总工会西南办事处副主任杨超说，西南地区解放时间较晚，当时部分厂矿遭到敌人破坏，交通尚未恢复，在这样极为困难的情况下，西南区的工人们仍迅速地恢复了生产秩序。一九五○年成渝铁路修建工程开工后，职工群众的生产热情更为提高，工会工作取得很大成就。现在，全区五金冶炼、机器、纺织和铁路等七个产业，已经有百分之八十以上的职工组织起来，涌现出劳动模范和模范工作者一万三千五百多人，先进小组八百四十九个，有一万四千多名工人被培养提拔为技术人员和管理干部。随着生产的恢复和发展，职工的劳动条件和生活状况也已不断改善。杨超说，为了完成国家第一个五年建设计划的光荣任务，西南区全体职工决心和其他先进地区一起，进一步做好自己的工作。
    中华全国总工会中南工作委员会第一副主任何英才在发言中，介绍了中南区全体职工在恢复国家经济、抗美援朝和厂矿企业改革方面，取得了很大成就。他说，在一九五二年，中南全区的生产总值已比一九四九年提高了百分之四百，有一千一百多个单位的职工参加了劳动竞赛，提出合理化建议一万二千多件，涌现出劳动模范二万九千零四人。工会并输送了三万四千六百多个干部到工厂行政和政府机关去工作。工人生活状况也已相当改善。何英才说，中南区工会工作虽然取得不少成绩，但缺点还是很多的，特别是领导工作还不够深入、踏实，批评与自我批评还未成为经常制度，这些缺点必须在今后工作中认真加以克服。
    全国著名的模范工厂——五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉，在会上报告了他们的工厂四年来贯彻依靠工人阶级办好人民企业的基本方针，在工厂党组织的统一领导下，党组织、工厂行政和工会、青年团思想统一，步调一致，政治工作与经济工作相结合，学习苏联先进经验，通过集体合同巩固了劳动与技术相结合的持久竞赛，保证了国家计划的逐年全面地超额完成。在这基础上，改善了职工群众的物质和文化生活。由于这些巨大成绩和他们创造的重要经验，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会和中华全国总工会已授予该厂以“模范工厂”的光荣称号。齐廷汉向大会表示，他们今后还要克服工作中存在着的缺点，继续深入开展爱国劳动竞赛，进一步学习苏联先进经验，保证在一九五三年内提高产品合格率百分之零点五，降低成本百分之四，并提前一个月全面完成全年的国家计划，为完成第一个五年建设计划打下胜利的基础。
    七二四厂职工家属委员会委员高凤琴，在发言中用生动事例，介绍了她们厂里家属工作的巨大成就。她说，现在她们工人住宅区已变成一个互助友爱的大家庭，家属都已组织起来，大家都关心工厂里的生产。高凤琴所在的那个组，八个月生了十三个孩子，都没有影响男人们的出勤率。全区做到了八净——厨房、厕所、澡堂、寝室、被褥、身体、衣服、屋外都净；五灭——臭虫、蚊子、跳蚤、虱子、老鼠都没有了。那里普遍订立了爱国公约和夫妇公约，每周检查一次。一有事情，全住宅区一千八百个孩子都得到了临时托儿站照顾。男女一齐进步，提高生产的劲头来了。家属们思想、文化提高后，就成了生产的后备军。工厂里已有二百五十个优秀家属参加了生产。高凤琴兴奋地说：“旧生活一去不会来了，我们创造了新生活，我们决不忘记共产党、工会对我们的关怀和帮助。”她说：“我们一定还要加倍努力，把家属成为推动生产的力量，我们要有更高的生产，更美好的生活，让职工和他们的家属们一齐发动起来，为了国家工业化，为更美好的生活一齐奋斗吧！”
    国营上海第一棉纺织厂车间副主任、劳动模范朱发弟，她在厂里整整做了十七年的织布女工。她在发言中叙述她在解放前受帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫和剥削的痛苦情况，那时，她生了八个孩子死掉了七个。解放后，她认识到自己当了国家的主人，因此积极生产，连得了十四次红旗奖。因为不出次布和坏布，又被选为上海市劳动模范，出席了
    “一九五一织布工作法”的总结会议。她开会回来后，教很多上海织布工人学会了这个先进的工作法。她说，参加这次大会以后，她更认清了今后应该努力的方向。她回去一定动员大家努力搞好生产，为完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
    二○三厂技工训练班车工指导员、劳动模范彭松福在会上报告了他创造车工基本技术速成教学法的经过。
    在七日下午大会上，法属西非达加邮电工会总书记迪亚洛·赛杜，法属赤道非洲与喀麦隆工会联络委员会书记梅沃阿·贝克，阿尔及利亚农林工人工会书记、阿尔及利亚工会联络委员会执行委员阿里·古杰·穆罕默德，相继向大会致辞。他们向大会祝贺，庆贺中国人民的成就，祝贺世界人民的大团结。他们的发言受到全场热烈欢迎。
    法属西非达加邮电工会总书记迪亚洛·赛杜，代表正在为独立而斗争的黑非洲工人，向中国光荣的人民致兄弟般的敬礼和最诚恳的祝福。他热情地说：对非洲殖民地人民来说，胜利了的中国人民，是他们争取解放的榜样，对他们是一种鼓舞。中国共产党和中国人民解放军的辉煌历史，是整个非洲人民所景仰的和关切地学习的历史榜样。天才的毛泽东的名字在非洲森林的尽头，像回声似的发着巨响。
    迪亚洛·赛杜在叙述了殖民主义者的残酷罪行和非洲工人的悲惨境况以后，充满信心地谈到他们的斗争。迪亚洛·赛杜说，非洲工人在他们的老大哥法国总工会的不懈的支持之下，正从胜利走向胜利，并改善着他们的生活条件。即使在非洲最僻远的地区，到处都有罢工和反对殖民统治者的群众示威。不论是殖民地的殴打，不论是强暴的监禁，都不能阻止非洲人民走向彻底解放。
    法属赤道非洲与喀麦隆工会联络委员会书记梅沃阿·贝克，在大会上报告了非洲人民所受到的殖民奴役和非洲人民争取民族解放的英勇斗争。梅沃阿·贝克说，帝国主义者把非洲变成一个战略基地和可以自由进行剥削的天堂。非洲殖民地当局在非洲居民中实行分裂政策，种族歧视。他们用无理逮捕、强制劳动和监禁等办法镇压非洲人民的反抗。非洲人民的生活已陷于极端的贫困。在贫民窟中，潮湿、肮脏、疾病和死亡不断发生。失业的现象到处蔓延。有百分之九十的非洲人民不认识字。十五万居民中只有一个医院。他说，非洲工人虽然遭受到一系列的贫困、镇压和殖民主义者的迫害，但是他们仍在不断地进行斗争。一九五二年十一月三日法属西非工人的大规模罢工，获得了巨大的胜利，这是震动国际资本主义基础的全世界工人阶级的胜利。最后，他说和平问题是全世界，特别是殖民地人民所关心的问题，殖民地人民正在更紧密地团结起来，进行反对战争、争取自由和民族独立的斗争。
    阿尔及利亚农林工人工会书记、阿尔及利亚工会联络委员会执行委员阿里·古杰·穆罕默德，在大会上报告了非洲及阿尔及利亚人民的悲惨境遇。他说，在阿尔及利亚，五十万小农只拥有二百五十万公顷的土地，而一万三千个本地的地主却拥有三百三十万公顷最肥沃的耕地。九百个欧洲大地主就占有约一百万公顷的土地。在六年内，一百十九个殖民地公司在阿尔及利亚掠夺的利润达六百零三亿一千九百万法郎。阿尔及利亚劳动人民的收入极少，卫生条件极为恶劣，百分之九十的人是文盲。在阿尔及利亚被捕的爱国人士，如果把监禁的年限加在一起，达到九百五十五年零四个月，罚款总数为一千九百七十九万六千法郎，管制时间为五百七十年，剥夺公民权的时间为一千二百一十年。阿尔及利亚劳动人民在最近几年中进行了数十次大大小小的罢工，并且得到了重大的成就。阿尔及利亚人民并在实际斗争中更加团结了。他们正在解放的道路上迈进。
    大会执行主席何英才代表大会对三位非洲工会代表的发言，表示热烈欢迎，对非洲人民的痛苦表示深切的同情，对他们的英勇斗争表示支持。
    在下午大会上，阿尔及利亚工会代表，在热烈的掌声中，向大会献旗。
    大会副秘书长董昕在大会上宣布继续收到来自国内外的贺电和贺函共一千二百六十件，并宣读了巴基斯坦总工会给大会的贺信。
    大会进行至下午六时十分休会。
