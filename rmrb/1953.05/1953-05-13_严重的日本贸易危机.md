    Serious Japanese Trade Crisis
    Xu Ming
    Under the control and plunder of the United States, Japan's foreign trade is rapidly declining, and the crisis is becoming increasingly serious.
    In fiscal year 1952 (April 1952 to March 1953), Japan's foreign exports generally decreased month by month, and the situation further deteriorated in the last quarter (January to March of this year). According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the total export value in fiscal year 1952 was only 1.196 billion US dollars, a decrease of 16.1 percent compared to the total export value in fiscal year 1951. Fiscal year 1951 was the highest year for Japan's export total since the war. However, even according to the Yoshida government's white paper on Japanese trade, it only amounted to 31 percent of the pre-war level (1934 to 1936). The seriousness of the problem is particularly evident in the fact that the main export commodities are in a state of obstructed sales. For example, cotton products, which account for the largest proportion of Japan's exports, have been forced to sell to the Southeast Asian market due to US restrictions, and have been countered by British forces, leading to repeated declines in sales. In 1952, Japan's total export of cotton products was 476 million US dollars, a sharp decrease of 184 million US dollars compared to the export total of 660 million US dollars in 1951. The export volume of cotton cloth also plummeted from 1.1 billion square yards in 1950 and 1.09 billion square yards in 1951 to 760 million square yards in 1952. Another example is steel and its products, which account for the second largest share of Japan's exports. Because they are forced to use expensive and low-quality raw materials imported from the United States, the cost of Japanese products sometimes exceeds the standard selling price in the international market; in addition, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and other countries are doing their best to expand the export of steel and its products, making it difficult for Japanese steel and its products to compete in the international market. According to Kyodo News Agency on March 16, since the end of last year, Japan's export volume of steel materials has decreased by 50 percent.
    As for Japan's trade imports, the problem is even more serious. In fiscal year 1952, Japan's exports shrank greatly, but imports decreased by only 1.1 percent; the inability of imports to decrease accordingly with exports resulted in a trade deficit of more than 900 million US dollars, creating the highest annual deficit record in Japan's post-war history. The vast majority of Japan's post-war imports are American goods. The United States regards Japan as its colonial market, forcibly dumping goods and raw materials that it cannot sell elsewhere, especially after the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, it monopolized all raw material imports to Japan. On the other hand, the United States has erected high tariff barriers to strictly prevent Japanese goods from entering the US market. According to statistics, from the Japanese surrender to 1950, goods from the United States accounted for two-thirds of the total import value in Japan's total foreign trade, but exports to the United States only accounted for one-quarter of Japan's total exports. In 1951, Japan's trade deficit with the United States increased by another 177 percent compared to 1950. The United States' exports to Japan not only use its special position in Japan to arbitrarily raise prices for plunder, but also completely follow the interests of US dumping commodities instead of according to Japan's needs. For example, the United States forced Japan to import goods that directly compete with Japanese industry, which has hit Japan's national industry. Japanese business circles have launched opposition movements against the import of American cars, machinery, butter, pulp, and grease, etc. For example, according to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, in the pre-war year of 1935, Japan's grain imports were only 600,000 tons, but after the war, mainly due to the dumping of surplus grain by the United States, grain imports in 1947 had already increased to 1.3 million tons, and in 1951, they soared to 3.4 million tons, and the Yoshida government planned to import even more grain in 1952, increasing to 3.53 million tons. At the same time, the raw materials that the United States shipped to Japan were completely determined by the needs of the US industry itself. Therefore, sometimes Japan is forced to import large quantities of raw materials that Japan does not urgently need, while at other times Japan cannot easily obtain the raw materials that Japan urgently needs.
    Foreign trade plays a very important role in Japan's economy. Taking 1950 as an example, 100 percent of the cotton, wool, and bauxite, 60 percent of iron ore and salt, and 80 percent of crude oil used in Japanese industry were imported from abroad; while more than 70 percent of the cotton products, more than 20 percent of steel and steel products, sewing machines, cameras, etc. produced by industry are used for export. Therefore, the downturn in Japan's foreign trade has severely hit the entire Japanese economy.
    Due to the decline in exports, many Japanese factories and enterprises accumulated too much product last year, and they stopped work and reduced production one after another. For example, due to sluggish foreign sales, Japan's textile industry reduced production by 40 percent in March last year, and a wave of bargain sales swept the yarn and cloth market. However, the situation did not improve as a result. By the end of October, the national inventory of cotton yarn was as high as 254,000 bales, so the price fell more sharply. The price of Japanese cotton yarn was as high as 600 yen per pound in the autumn and winter of 1950, but on November 21 last year, the price of cotton yarn on the Tokyo Textile Exchange plummeted to 172 yen per pound. The situation of the Japanese textile industry last year was called an unprecedented crisis in Japan in eighty years. Japanese capitalists tried their best to pass the disaster on to the workers. Many capitalists laid off workers on a large scale, tried to lower wages as much as possible, and increased labor intensity. However, many enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, have been unable to use layoffs and other means to escape the crisis, and have had to declare bankruptcy. The wave of bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises that began in the autumn of 1951 became even more violent last year. In just eight months from January to August last year, as many as 9,600 companies went bankrupt, and in the second half of last year alone, more than 480 export companies went bankrupt. As a result, the number of unemployed people in Japan has increased dramatically. Even Japanese officials admit that at least 8 million people go to "employment agencies" every month to request job introductions. Of course, this number does not include the large number of unemployed people who simply do not go to "employment agencies" because they feel that "all they get is disappointment."
    The large-scale dumping of surplus agricultural products by the United States to Japan has deepened Japan's dependence on American grain and destroyed Japanese agricultural production. During the same period that US grain imports to Japan soared, Japanese rural areas experienced the tragic scene of agricultural population exodus and arable land abandonment under the multiple blows of the Yoshida government's heavy taxes, forced low-price purchases, and American grain flooding the market. According to the 1952 "Yomiuri Yearbook," the cultivated area of ​​Japanese rice paddies has been reduced from 3.9 million cho in 1945 to 3 million cho in 1950, a reduction of almost a quarter in five years.
    The United States' predatory trade with Japan has caused Japan's trade balance to be unbalanced, and the deficit figure has increased year by year. According to statistics from the US military headquarters stationed in Japan, from 1946 to 1951, Japan's cumulative trade deficit totaled more than 2.38 billion US dollars. In the past, Japan had to rely on its surplus with other regions to offset part of its deficit with the United States. After the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, it ordered a large number of munitions in Japan, forcing Japan to use munitions production to balance the huge deficit in foreign exchange receipts and expenditures caused by the trade deficit. Since 1950, the deficit in Japan's foreign exchange receipts and expenditures has mainly been made up for by the "special procurement orders" used by the United States to carry out the Korean War and the consumption of the US military stationed in Japan (including the dirty expenses of American soldiers ravaging Japanese women). This has put the Japanese economy on the track of militarization and deepened the dependence of the Japanese economy on the United States. Recently, after China and North Korea put forward proposals on the Korean armistice negotiations, the prospect of a Korean armistice has caused a great impact on the Japanese economy supported by "special procurement orders," which has led Japanese bourgeois newspapers to shout: "The government and the economic circles should thoroughly study the new situation and quickly change the past practices" ("Asahi Shimbun"), "We must abandon the beggar-like inferiority that always depends on foreign countries (referring to the United States) and realize economic self-reliance." ("Sangyo Keizai Shimbun")
    The fact that Japan's foreign trade has fallen into such an increasingly serious crisis is entirely the result of the United States' implementation of a colonial policy in Japan. During the years of the US occupation of Japan, it used its special position in Japan to manipulate the Japanese economy through various illegal measures, not only turning Japan into its dumping market, but also turning Japan into a tool for the United States to expand its power and seize the markets of Britain, France, and other countries. Since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, it has vigorously supported Japanese munitions production, destroyed Japanese peaceful industries, forced the Japanese economy to be incorporated into the war track, and forced Japan to implement an "embargo," blocking Japan's traditional trade with the democratic world market, especially with China, which has further accelerated Japan's foreign trade into a state of irreversible decline.
    Before the war, 46 percent of Japan's total imports came from the Asian continent. However, since the United States forced Japan to implement the "embargo" policy in December 1950, Japan has been prohibited from importing cheap and high-quality raw materials from China, and then the United States monopolized all sources of raw materials needed by Japan. The raw materials that the United States forced Japan to sell were not only expensive, but also of extremely poor quality. Under the monopoly of the United States, Japan had to buy low-quality American coal at a price equal to 150 percent of the price of Chinese Kailuan coal; it had to buy American soybeans mixed with 26 percent sand, weeds, and even horse manure at a price equal to 160 percent of the price of Chinese Northeast soybeans; it had to buy non-industrial grade iron ore transferred by the United States at a price equal to 150 percent of the price of Chinese iron ore; it had to spend freight charges exceeding 200 to 300 percent of the salt price to buy salt from the distant Red Sea. The high cost of raw materials has greatly increased the cost of Japanese industrial products. Although the Yoshida government used the donations and taxes forcibly levied from the people to subsidize the price difference of exported commodities and tried its best to exploit workers, the prices of some major export commodities, centered on the steel industry, were still higher than the international market level, which seriously hit the competitiveness of Japanese commodities in the international market and affected Japan's export trade.
    Before the war, Japan's exports to Asian countries accounted for 51 percent of Japan's total exports, but in 1951, Japan's exports to China were forced to plummet to only 0.7 percent of Japan's total foreign exports. At the same time, the United States strictly restricted Japanese goods from entering the US market. In 1951, the proportion of Japanese exports to the dollar area in Japan's total exports has decreased by nearly 50 percent compared to before the war. As a result, Japan's foreign exports were left with only one path: the Southeast Asian market. However, Southeast Asia is the traditional market of the United Kingdom. If Japan wants to expand in the Southeast Asian market, it will naturally be countered by the United Kingdom, which has formed a fierce trade competition between Britain and Japan, prompting the contradictions between Britain and Japan to become increasingly acute. In the past few years after the war, Japan's trade with the sterling area, including the Southeast Asian sterling area, has always been in surplus, and it has accumulated 120 million pounds in trade. However, since November 1951 to July 1952, the United Kingdom successively announced four times that it would take tough measures to save sterling expenditure and restrict imports. As a result, Southeast Asian countries have strictly restricted the import of Japanese goods, so that Japan's exports to the sterling area last year not only decreased from more than 218 million pounds in 1951 to more than 170 million pounds, but also changed from a surplus to a deficit from June last year. The trade deficit for the entire year of 1952 reached 26 million pounds. At the end of December last year, Japan's holdings of sterling had been exhausted to only 76 million pounds. By the end of March this year, according to the Ministry of Finance, Japan's remaining sterling was only 28 million pounds. Japanese goods in Southeast Asia have not only been hit by the United Kingdom, but also suffered from the competitive threat of the rising West Germany and Italy. West Germany's sales of machinery and fertilizers to Southeast Asian countries have exceeded Japan, and Italy has grabbed a large part of Japan's rayon business. Obviously, Japan's trade with Southeast Asia is not smooth sailing.
    It can be seen that if Japan wants to save its trade crisis, it can only break free from the shackles of the United States, fundamentally get rid of its subordinate colonial economic status, develop an independent and peaceful economy, improve the living standards of the people, and conduct equal and mutually beneficial autonomous trade with the democratic world market, especially with the major countries in Asia.
    Therefore, in the past year or so, the voices of the Japanese people demanding to get rid of US control and plunder and to conduct Sino-Japanese trade have become louder and louder, and have rapidly developed into a mass movement of all strata of Japanese society. The signing of the "Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement" on June 1 last year marked a new beginning for Sino-Japanese trade. The "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference" organized under the initiative of the Japan-China Friendship Association soon became an important force for the Japanese people to promote trade with China. At present, more than 60 prefectures and cities in Japan have established local branches of the "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference," which are helping national and local industrial and commercial groups to ask the Yoshida government to relax the scope of the embargo, and are jointly conducting the struggle to strive for Japan-China trade with the "Japan National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises" and the "National Conference of Japan Democratic Commerce and Industry Associations." On April 3 this year, representatives of the Japanese business community gathered in Tokyo to hold the "National Industrial and Commercialists' Conference to Promote Japan-China Trade to Break Through the Crisis." Under the strong influence of the Japanese people, in the upper house of the Japanese Diet in the previous session, as many as 292 members of various parties and factions, including 70 Liberal Party members, formed the "Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" on December 12 last year. The members of the Diet candidates who participated in this general election also formed the "Political Alliance for Promoting Japan-China Trade" on April 6.
    It is impossible for the United States to forever reduce Japan to a disaster-stricken colonial status and block the independent development of the Japanese national economy. The Japanese people's struggle for economic independence and trade autonomy will, together with their struggle for national liberation, achieve final victory.

    严重的日本贸易危机
    徐明
    在美国的控制和掠夺下，日本的对外贸易正在迅速衰退，危机越来越严重了。
    一九五二年度（一九五二年四月到一九五三年三月）日本的对外输出，基本上是在逐月减少，最后一个季度（今年一月到三月）情况更加恶化。据日本大藏省的统计，一九五二年度的出口总额只有十一亿九千六百万美元，比一九五一年度的出口总额减少了百分之十六点一。一九五一年度日本出口总额是战后最高的一个年度。但是即使按照吉田政府关于日本贸易的白皮书的统计，也仅仅相当于战前——一九三四年到一九三六年水平的百分之三十一。问题的严重还特别表现在主要的输出商品都已陷于销路阻塞状态。例如，占日本出口最大比重的棉制品，由于美国的限制，被迫向东南亚市场销售而受到了英国势力的反击，销路一再下降。一九五二年日本棉制品出口总额为四亿七千六百万美元，比一九五一年出口总额六亿六千万美元锐减了一亿八千四百万美元。棉布的出口量，也从一九五零年的十一亿方码、一九五一年的十亿九千万方码激降为一九五二年的七亿六千万方码。又如占日本输出第二位的钢铁及其制品，因为被迫必须使用美国输入的价昂质劣的原料，日本产品成本有时就已超过了国际市场的标准售价；加以英国、西德等国都在竭力扩展钢铁及其制品的输出，使日本的钢铁及其制品很难在国际市场上竞争。据三月十六日共同社透露，从去年年底以来，日本钢料的出口量已下降了百分之五十。
    至于日本的贸易输入，问题更为严重。一九五二年度日本的输出是大大萎缩了，但输入仅仅减少了百分之一点一；输入不能随输出相应减低，以致贸易入超高达九亿多美元，造成了日本战后年度入超额的最高纪录。战后日本的输入，绝大部分是美国货，美国把日本作为它的殖民地市场，将它在别处推销不了的商品和原料拿到日本来强制倾销，特别是在美国发动侵朝战争后，更垄断了日本全部原料的输入。另一方面，美国却高筑关税壁垒，严防日货进入美国市场。据统计，从日本投降到一九五零年为止，日本的全部对外贸易额中，来自美国的货物，占了入口总额的三分之二，但对美国的输出则只占日本输出总额的四分之一。一九五一年日本对美国的贸易入超比一九五零年又增加了百分之一百七十七。美国对日本的输出，不仅利用它在日本的特殊地位，任意抬高价格进行掠夺，并且不是根据日本的需要，而是完全服从于美国倾销商品的利益。例如，美国强制日本输入与日本工业直接发生竞争的商品，使日本民族工业受到了打击。日本工商界曾对美国汽车、机械、牛油、纸浆、油脂等等的输入展开过反对运动。又如：据日本大藏省的统计，在战前一九三五年，日本谷类输入只有六十万吨，但是战后主要由于美国剩余粮食的倾销，一九四七年输入的粮食，就已增加到一百三十万吨，一九五一年激增到三百四十万吨，而一九五二年吉田政府计划输入的粮食，更增加到三百五十三万吨。同时，美国输给日本的原料，也完全是视美国工业本身的需要与否而决定，所以有时强迫日本输入大批并非日本急需的原料，而有时日本急需的原料却又不能轻易获得。
    日本的对外贸易在它的经济中占着极重要的地位。以一九五○年为例，日本工业所用原料的棉花、羊毛、铁矾土的百分之百，铁矿砂、盐的百分之六十，原油的百分之八十都是从国外输入的；而工业生产的棉制品的百分之七十以上，钢铁的百分之二十以上及钢铁制品缝纫机、照相机等的百分之七十都是用以输出的。所以，日本的对外贸易不振，严重地打击了整个日本经济。
    由于输出的衰退，去年日本许多工厂企业的产品积存过多，纷纷停工减产。例如，日本的纺织业由于外销不振，去年三月曾缩减了产量的百分之四十，纱布市场并掀起了贱价抛售浪潮。然而情况并未能由此好转，到十月底，全国积存的棉纱多达二十五万四千包，于是价格更剧烈下跌。日本棉纱的价格，一九五○年秋冬间，曾高达每磅六百日元，但去年十一月二十一日东京纺织交易所的棉纱价格，暴落到每磅一百七十二日元。去年日本纺织业的这种情况，被称为日本八十年未有的危机。日本大资本家们竭力设法把灾祸转嫁到工人身上，许多资本家大规模地解雇工人，尽量压低工资，加强劳动强度。然而，许多企业，特别是中小企业已经无法利用解雇等手段来逃避危机，只好宣告倒闭。从一九五一年秋天开始的中小企业的倒风，到了去年更猛烈起来。去年一月到八月仅仅八个月的期间，倒闭的公司就达九千六百家，而去年下半年中，单单出口公司就有四百八十多家破产。因此，日本失业人数大量增加，即使日本官方也承认，每月至少有八百万人到“职业介绍所”去请求介绍职业。这个数目，当然还没有包括那些因为感到“得到的只有失望”而根本不去“职业介绍所”的大批失业者。
    美国剩余农产品的大量向日本倾销，加深了日本对美国粮食的依赖，摧残了日本的农业生产。在美国输入日本粮食激增的同一时期之内，日本农村在吉田政府的重税、强迫低价征购和充斥市场的美国粮食的重重打击下，出现了农业人口流亡和耕地荒芜的惨象。据一九五二年“读卖年鉴”的统计，日本稻田的耕种面积，已经从一九四五年的三百九十万町步，减为一九五○年的三百万町步，五年之内缩减了几乎四分之一。
    美国对日本的掠夺式的贸易，造成了日本贸易收支不能平衡，入超数字年年增大。据驻日美军总部的统计，从一九四六年到一九五一年止，日本贸易入超总额累计已达二十三亿八千多万美元。过去日本为了支付对美入超还要依靠对其他地区的出超来抵补其中的一部分。美国发动侵朝战争后，在日本国内订购大批军火，迫使日本只好用军火生产品来平衡贸易入超所造成的外汇收支上的巨额赤字。一九五○年以来，日本外汇收支上的赤字，就主要是依靠美国用于进行朝鲜战争的“特需订货”和驻日美军的消费（其中包括美国兵蹂躏日本妇女的肮脏费用）来弥补的。这样就使日本经济走上军事化的轨道，并加深了日本经济对美国的依赖性。最近中、朝两国提出关于朝鲜停战谈判的建议后，朝鲜停战的前景，引起了依靠“特需订货”支撑的日本经济极大的冲击，使得日本资产阶级报纸大声疾呼：“政府和经济界都应该彻底研究新的情况，迅速改变过去的作法”（“朝日新闻”），“必须摒弃永远依赖外国（指美国）的乞丐般的劣根性，实现经济自立。”（“产业经济新闻”）
    日本对外贸易陷入这样愈来愈严重的危机，完全是美国在日本推行殖民地政策的结果。美国占领日本的几年中，利用它在日本的特殊地位，通过种种非法措施，操纵日本经济，不仅把日本变成了它的倾销市场，还把日本变成了美国扩张势力抢夺英法等国市场的工具。美国发动侵朝战争以来，大力扶植日本军火生产，摧毁日本和平工业，强使日本经济纳入战争轨道，并强迫日本实行“禁运”，阻断了日本和民主世界市场特别是和中国的传统贸易，更使日本对外贸易加速陷于一蹶不振的境地。
    日本在战前，输入总额的百分之四十六是来自亚洲大陆的。但是自从一九五○年十二月美国强迫日本执行“禁运”政策以来，日本即被禁止输入中国价廉质良的原料，随后美国就垄断了日本所需原料的全部来源。美国强售给日本的原料，不仅价格昂贵，而且质量极差。日本在美国的垄断下，不得不用等于中国开滦煤价格百分之一百五十的代价，去买美国的劣质煤；不得不用等于中国东北大豆价格百分之一百六十的代价，去买掺有百分之二十六的砂土、杂草甚至马粪的美国大豆；不得不用等于中国铁矿砂价格百分之一百五十的代价，去买美国转手的不合工业用规格的铁矿砂；不得不花费运费超过盐价百分之二百到三百的代价，去买遥远的红海的盐。原料的昂贵大大增加了日本工业品的成本。吉田政府虽然利用强征自人民的捐税津贴输出商品的差价，并尽力剥削工人，但是，以钢铁业为中心的一些主要输出商品的价格依然高于国际市场水平，这就严重地打击了日本商品在国际市场上的竞争能力，影响了日本的输出贸易。
    日本对亚洲大陆各国的输出，在战前占日本总输出的百分之五十一，但一九五一年日本对中国的输出，被迫激降到只占日本对外输出总额的百分之零点七。与此同时，美国又严格限制日本货物进入美国市场。一九五一年日本向美元地区的输出所占日本输出总额的比例，已比战前降低了近百分之五十。结果，日本的对外输出只剩下东南亚市场的一条道路。但是，东南亚是英国的传统市场，日本要在东南亚市场扩展，自然就要遭到英国的反击，这就形成了英、日间剧烈的贸易竞争，促使英、日间的矛盾日趋尖锐化。日本在战后几年中，对包括东南亚英镑地区在内的英镑区的贸易始终是出超的，并在贸易中积蓄了一亿二千万英镑。但是，从一九五
    一年十一月到一九五二年七月，英国接连四次宣布采取节约英镑支出、限制输入的强硬措施后，东南亚各国纷纷严格限制日货进口，使日本去年对英镑区的输出，不但从一九五一年的两亿一千八百多万镑减为一亿七千多万镑，并且从去年六月起由出超
    一变而为入超。一九五二年全年贸易的逆差达两千六百万镑。去年十二月底，日本握有的英镑已消耗到仅剩七千六百万镑。到今年三月底，据大藏省公布，日本结存的英镑只剩两千八百万镑了。日本货在东南亚不仅受到了英国的打击，并且也遭受着再起的西德和意大利的竞争威胁。西德出售给东南亚国家的机器和肥料已经超过日本，意大利抢去了日本很大一部分人造丝生意。显然，日本对东南亚的贸易，并非坦途。
    由此可见，日本要挽救它的贸易危机，那就只有挣脱美国的镣铐，根本摆脱从属美国的殖民地经济地位，发展独立的和平经济，提高人民生活水平，并与民主世界市场首先是与亚洲主要国家进行平等互惠的自主贸易。
    因此，最近一年多来，日本人民要求摆脱美国的控制和掠夺、进行中日贸易的呼声越来越响亮，并且已经迅速发展成为日本全国各阶层的群众性运动。去年六月一日，“中日贸易协议”的签订，更标志着中日贸易新的开始。在日中友好协会发起下组织起来的“日中贸易促进会议”，成立后不久就成为日本人民推进与中国贸易的重要力量。现在，日本已有六十个以上的县、市成立了“日中贸易促进会议”的地方分会，它正在帮助全国性的和地方性的工商业团体向吉田政府要求放宽禁运的范围，并且联合“日本全国中小企业协议会”与“日本民主商工会全国恳谈会”，进行争取日中贸易的斗争。今年四月三日，日本全国企业界的代表，集中在东京举行了“全国工商业家促进日中贸易突破危机大会”。在日本人民强烈的影响下，日本上届国会参众二院中，包括七十名自由党员在内的数达二百九十二名各党各派的议员，在去年十二月十二日组成了“日中贸易促进议员联盟”。参加这次国会大选的议员候选人，也在四月六日组成了“促进日中贸易政治同盟”。
    美国要永远把日本降为灾难深重的殖民地地位、阻断日本国民经济的独立发展是不可能的。日本人民争取经济独立和贸易自主的斗争，将和他们争取民族解放的斗争一起取得最后的胜利。
