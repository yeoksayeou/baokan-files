Hua Luogeng's Mathematical Work "Additive Prime Number Theory" Forthcoming

The book "Additive Prime Number Theory" by Hua Luogeng, a renowned Chinese mathematician and Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will soon be published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The original manuscript of this book was completed in 1941. In 1947, the Institute of Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences published it as a special publication of the institute, translated by Professors Siegel and Vasilikov. The book now being published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences is a revised and supplemented version based on the Russian edition, with several chapters rewritten by Professor Hua Luogeng based on the progress made in additive prime number theory since 1941.

This book describes the new results in the field of additive prime number theory. The foundation of this science was laid by Academician Vinogradov, Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (Vinogradov won the Stalin Prize for his mathematical works), and Professor Hua Luogeng's research has made significant contributions to the development of this science. This book is related to several famous mathematical problems in the world - Goldbach's problem, Waring's problem, and Tarry's problem.

In the preface, the author says: "The publication of this small book in the national language is inseparable from the people's democratic government. Recalling that twelve years have passed since the completion of the first draft, and six years have passed since the publication of the Russian edition. In the long years before liberation, the issue of publishing this book in China evolved from being about to be published, to waiting to be published, to the point where the original manuscript disappeared without a trace. So much so that today, at the urging of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I still have to translate it from the Russian version for printing. These facts powerfully illustrate how corrupt the old regime was, how indifferent it was to science, and how the people's democratic government cherishes scientific achievements."

The preface also states: "The mood is exceptionally pleasant when the work is completed. Not only because my small book can be published in my own country, but especially because the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, which I longed for in the past, is realized today - it is already unbreakable."

### 华罗庚数学著作“堆垒素数论”即将出版

    华罗庚数学著作“堆垒素数论”即将出版
    我国著名数学家、中国科学院数学研究所所长华罗庚所著“堆垒素数论”一书不久将由中国科学院出版。
    这本书的原稿是在一九四一年完成的。一九四七年苏联科学院数学研究所将它作为该所的专刊出版，译者是锡伽尔和瓦西里柯夫两教授。现在中国科学院出版的这本书，是根据俄文版加以修正和补充而成的，其中有几章是华罗庚教授根据一九四一年以来在堆垒素数论这方面的进展改写的。
    这本书叙述了关于堆垒素数论方面的新结果，这一科学的基础，是苏联科学院数学研究所所长维诺格拉多夫院士（维诺格拉多夫曾以其数学著作获得斯大林奖金）所奠定的，而华罗庚教授的研究成果对于这一科学的发展作了重大的贡献。这本书和世界上几个有名的数学问题——古特拔黑问题、华林问题和塔来问题都有关系。
    著者在序言中说：“这一本小书能够用本国文字出版问世，是和人民民主政权分不开的。回忆一下，离初稿完成的日子已经十二个年头了，离俄文版刊出的日子也已隔了六年。在解放以前的漫长的岁月中，这书在中国刊出的问题，由即将出版、等待出版一直演变到把原稿搞得无影无踪，以致到了今天，在中国科学院敦促之下，我还得从俄文本翻译出来付印，这些事实，有力地说明了旧的政权怎样腐化，怎样地不关心科学，而人民民主政权又是怎样地宝爱科学成果。”
    序言中又说：“在工作完成的时候，心情是异常愉快的。不但是由于我的小书得以在本国出版，而特别是从前所渴望着的中苏两国的友谊今天是实现了——已经牢不可破了。”    （新华社）
