    The second phase of the Jingjiang Diversion Project, which commenced in mid-November last year, was successfully completed on April 25 this year. Over these five months, the following tasks were accomplished: reinforcement of the Jingjiang right bank levee; repair and reinforcement of the east and west levees of the Hudu River; reinforcement of the embankments of thirteen safety zones within the diversion area; construction of seven new safety zones and eight safety platforms; dredging of channels in the diversion area; excavation of beach areas upstream and downstream of the intake and control gates; and completion of the riprap protection project for the east levee of the Hudu River, totaling over 11 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. Beyond the planned construction, thirteen culvert projects for the safety zones were completed, over 397,000 trees were planted on the diversion area embankments, and 57 central drainage ditches and 87 production roads, along with 195 small and medium-sized bridges, were excavated and constructed within the diversion and safety zones. With this, the entire Jingjiang Diversion Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has been successfully completed.
    During the second phase of the Jingjiang Diversion Project, the engineering command organs were very concerned about the living conditions of the laborers, providing them with timely supplies of living materials and labor tools, and paying attention to sanitation work. The laborers' enthusiasm for labor remained high throughout. Around the Spring Festival, under the slogan of welcoming the country's large-scale economic construction, a vigorous patriotic labor emulation campaign was launched on the construction site. Wang Youtai, a laborer from Yidu County, Hubei Province, created the "deep digging and steep cutting" method in earthwork, increasing the work efficiency of each person per day from an average of 1.68 cubic meters to 7.6 cubic meters. Laborers from Jiangling, Songzi, and Jianli counties in Hubei Province created advanced working methods such as "deep ditch silt discharge" and "bamboo basket tied with grass" on channel projects with deep water, thick mud, cold weather, and frozen ground, increasing the work efficiency of each person per day to a maximum of 9.7 cubic meters.
    The completion of the second phase of the Jingjiang Diversion Project has further consolidated the victorious achievements of the Jingjiang Diversion Project. Now, millions of farmers on both sides of the Jingjiang River are happily engaged in spring plowing and production, welcoming this year's harvest.

    荆江分洪工程第二期工程胜利完工
    荆江分洪工程第二期工程，去年十一月中旬开工，今年四月二十五日已胜利完工。在这五个多月内完成了：荆江右堤的加培、虎渡河东堤、西堤的培修、分洪区内十三个安全区围堤的加培，又新建了七个安全区、八个安全台，整理了分洪区渠道，刨毁了进洪闸、节制闸上、下游的滩地，完成了虎渡河东堤抛石护岸等工程，共做土方、石方一千一百多万公方。施工计划外，还完成了十三座安全区涵管工程，在分洪区围堤上植树三十九万七千多株，并在分洪区和安全区内开挖和修筑了中心排水沟五十七条，生产大道八十七条，中小桥梁一百九十五座。至此，长江中游的荆江分洪工程的全部工程胜利告成。
    荆江分洪工程第二期工程中，工程指挥机关都很关心民工生活，及时供应民工生活资料、劳动工具，并重视卫生工作。民工们劳动热情始终饱满。春节前后，在迎接祖国大规模经济建设的口号下，工地上展开了热火朝天的爱国劳动竞赛。湖北省宜都县民工王有泰在土方工程上创造了“深挖陡劈”法，将每人每天的工作效率由平均一点六八公方提高到七点六公方。湖北省江陵、松滋、监利等县民工，在水深泥厚、天寒冰冻的渠道工程上，创造了“深沟放淤”“箢箕系草”等先进工作法，使每人每天工作效率最高提高到九点七公方。
    荆江分洪工程第二期工程的完成，进一步巩固了荆江分洪工程的胜利成果。现在，荆江两岸千百万农民，正愉快地进行春耕生产，迎接今年的丰收。
