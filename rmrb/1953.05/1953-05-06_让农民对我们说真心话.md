    Let the Peasants Tell Us the Truth
    Lü Jianzhong
    Recently, I have heard more than once rural work cadres complain: "The peasants are unwilling to tell us the truth."

    This is very strange. In the past, when we mobilized the peasants to suppress bandits and oppose local bullies, the peasants, unafraid of difficulties, sent messages and led the way; when we led the peasants to distribute land, the peasants welcomed us as if we were family. Why is it that today, when we lead the peasants in production and construction, creating a happy life, the peasants are cold towards us and unwilling to tell us the truth?

    During the spring plowing season, I found the answer to this question in Liang Xudian Village, Wuzhi County. One evening, combining the actual situation of the village, I talked with the peasants about the CPC Central Committee's instructions to Party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing production, and the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production." The peasants were very excited after listening. They raised many fundamental questions and concluded: "Chairman Mao in Beijing understands our affairs clearly, while cadres who live in the village all day cannot see into our hearts."

    "Cannot see into the hearts of the masses," this is a warning from the peasants regarding our relationship with the masses, and it is the reason why "the peasants are unwilling to tell us the truth."

    The peasants are primarily concerned with us understanding the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy and guiding them forward step by step.

    The attitude of the peasants in Liang Xudian Village towards mutual aid and cooperation is "neither too fast nor too slow, taking one step at a time." They have initially seen the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation from their practical experience in improving production efficiency and agricultural technology. Peasants organized in the village account for 86 percent. The Fu Guangying Agricultural Production Cooperative has initially implemented an advanced system of contracting work, assigning production, and calculating work points based on piecework, which has greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the members. All the peasants in the village are watching and following it. The cooperative selects seeds, and the peasants follow suit; the cooperative conducts spring irrigation of wheat, and the peasants also break with convention and conduct spring irrigation of wheat. Many peasants say, "Let's wait and see, if the cooperative is run well, we will join in the fall."

    However, instead of starting from the characteristics of the peasants as small private owners and their existing experience, and guiding them to move forward steadily according to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, the cadres insisted on rudely dragging the peasants to run forward. Fu Guangying once asked the members to discuss the implementation of the "large warehouse" joint consumption system, but the members did not agree. The public property in the cooperative was also excessively expanded, and the members' livestock, large and small farm tools, were all priced and turned over to the public, with a total debt of 50 million yuan weighing heavily on the members; in addition, there was an 8 percent public accumulation fund. The members said anxiously, "We are very happy to see the wheat growing well, but we are worried about the big hole (debt) we are in. We put in so much effort, but we can't take the grain home after the harvest, it's so unfair!" This not only caused unrest among the members but also deepened the village's concerns about "fear of being nationalized," making them hesitate to join agricultural production cooperatives.

    What had an even worse impact on the peasants was that cadres, in order to "enter socialism early and be glorious," insisted on organizing so-called "livestock sharing groups" under the encouragement and support of county and district leaders (it is understood that such groups are not uncommon in other areas of Henan). Taking the mutual aid group led by village chief Fu Guangtian as an example, he forcibly pulled together three temporary mutual aid groups, with land operated in a decentralized manner, but livestock valued and made public. On the one hand, some group members could not afford the price of livestock; on the other hand, middle peasants were unwilling to sell their livestock to everyone. Wang Yufu put one of his two livestock into the group, but Fu Guangtian and some of the group members refused to accept this, saying, "Farmers all over the world are one family, it is glorious to enter 'society' early," and insisted that he sell the other one as well. In addition, middle peasants were required to pay money to engage in sideline occupations. Soon, Wang Yufu and Wang Yuyou, two middle-peasant households, were frightened and left the group; poor peasant Wang Xiancai also withdrew from the group because he could not afford livestock feed and sideline shares. The remaining twelve households were not actively producing because of undemocratic leadership and unreasonable systems; the livestock were neglected and became thinner day by day. If such "livestock sharing groups," which are ridiculed by peasants as "neither fish nor fowl," are not corrected as soon as possible, they are bound to collapse. Most of these groups have bought small livestock and turned them into large livestock, and once they collapse, it will be a tangled mess of accounts; this will not only affect production but also create disunity among the peasants.

    The cadres' blind adventurism and eagerness to be different have caused the peasants to misunderstand socialism and doubt the policies of the Party and the People's Government, hindering the full realization of the peasants' enormous productive potential. Phenomena such as "fear of standing out," "fear of becoming rich," stagnation of borrowing, and simple reliance on government loans have also arisen from this.

    The peasants are afraid that their property is not secure, but they say, "It is glorious to enter 'society' early." They say, "We know that cadres only like to hear about achievements so that they can report them to higher levels." In work, it is very dangerous to be seen as such a person by the peasants!

    "To be divorced from production in work is to be divorced from the masses politically." This is indeed the case. The peasants in Liang Xudian Village urgently demand increased production and improved agricultural technology. However, the cadres cannot meet this urgent demand of the peasants. During the spring plowing season, no less than ten cadres worked in Liang Xudian Village, and each of these cadres had their specific tasks and did their own thing. Spring plowing production, however, had neither a dedicated person to lead it nor specific tasks and plans. "Production is the overriding center" has become an empty slogan here. Cadres call on peasants to improve agricultural technology, but they themselves do not even understand ordinary agricultural technology. Cadres mobilize peasants to select cotton seeds, but they do not even know what Sizi cotton is.

    Last autumn, cadres called on peasants to carry out dense planting of wheat. The peasants in the village had several attitudes: a few village cadres and labor models believed that dense planting was good, and they also had cultivation technology and experience. Most young people blindly supported dense planting, but they lacked cultivation technology and experience. Most peasants were skeptical about dense planting, some planted slightly denser than in the past, and some planted densely on one or two mu to try it out. A few experienced old farmers opposed dense planting of wheat. As a result, only about 40 percent of the village's wheat was densely planted.

    The victory of a new thing always requires a serious struggle. The peasants in Liang Xudian Village are in the midst of a fierce struggle between advanced and conservative ideas regarding dense planting. According to their experience: dense wheat does not grow well if there is not enough fertilizer, and it is prone to lodging when it grows to maturity. Is there any guarantee that this year's densely planted wheat will grow well and not lodge? The peasants are very worried. Some go to their wheat fields several times a day to check, and some stare at the yellowing wheat seedlings due to lack of fertilizer and sigh. When the peasants see the cadres of the farm, they greet them warmly from afar, ask them to come to their homes for meals, and hope to learn the technology to guarantee increased wheat production.

    Clearly, guaranteeing increased wheat production is the peasants' prominent demand, and it is also the decisive link in whether advanced dense planting technology can win in the minds of the village's peasants. To ensure increased wheat production and the victory of spring sowing, the first thing to solve is the fertilizer problem.

    The cadres working in Liang Xudian Village did not lead and mobilize the peasants to carry out a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Cadres called on peasants to apply chemical fertilizers, but the economic departments were slow to lend the fertilizers to the peasants because of various procedures and systems. Some peasants bought chemical fertilizers, but the cadres did not know how to guide the peasants to apply them. Some peasants asked how to reasonably fertilize densely planted cotton, but the cadres could not answer. These facts show that improving agricultural technology is a complex and meticulous task that cannot be carried out with a frivolous attitude; they also show that if we do not seriously learn agricultural technology, we will not be able to lead peasants in production.

    As a result of the Liang Xudian Village cadres' divorce from production in their work, other tasks, such as the implementation of the Marriage Law, health work, rectification of substitute cultivation, elimination of illiteracy, and credit, have not been done well either. These dozen or so tasks are researched and studied in meetings by the various leading departments at the higher level, resolutions are made, plans are formulated, and instructions are printed and distributed to the townships at each level, which takes a lot of manpower and financial resources! However, the results of implementation in the township are: some were stopped halfway due to causing dissatisfaction among the masses, some were only mentioned at mass meetings, and some were put in drawers and have not yet met the masses!

    The peasants are dissatisfied with all of this, and they demand to speak in the newspapers: "What we want to do, the cadres refuse to do; what we want to say, the cadres refuse to listen. What's the use if Chairman Mao's policies are good, but the cadres don't follow them!"

    "Chairman Mao is against bureaucracy, and this bureaucracy must be seriously opposed!"

    It is essential to make the peasants tell us the truth, which has serious political significance. It is a yardstick for measuring the peasants' attitude towards the Party and the People's Government, that is, the problem of our relationship with the peasant masses. In fact, the peasants are willing to tell us the truth, as long as we humbly listen.

### 让农民对我们说真心话

    让农民对我们说真心话
    吕建中
    近来，我不止一次地听到有些农村工作干部苦恼地说：“农民不肯对我们说真心话。”
    这很奇怪。过去，我们发动农民剿土匪、反恶霸，农民不畏艰险，送信带路；我们领导农民分配土地，农民迎来送往，亲如家人。为什么今天我们领导农民进行生产建设，创造幸福生活，农民反而对我们态度冷淡，不说真心话呢？
    春耕生产当中，我在武陟县梁徐店村找到了关于这个问题的答案。一个夜晚，我结合这个村的实际情况，和农民谈了中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示，和人民日报社论“领导农业生产的关键所在”。农民听了实在兴奋。他们提出了许多带有根本性质的问题，并且作了这样的结语：“毛主席在北京摸清了我们的事，干部成天住在村里看不见我们的心。”
    “看不见群众的心”，这就是农民对于我们和群众的关系问题提出的警语，也就是“农民不肯对我们说真心话”的原因所在。 
    农民首先关心的是要我们认识小农经济的特点，一步一步引导他们前进。
    梁徐店村农民对互助合作的态度是“不走快，也不走慢，看准一步走一步”。他们从提高生产效率和改进农业技术的实际体验中，已初步看到了互助合作的好处。全村组织起来的农民占百分之八十六。傅光莹农业生产合作社初步实行了包工包产按件计工的先进制度，大大提高了社员的生产积极性。全村农民都注视着、追随着它。合作社选种，农民跟着选种；合作社进行小麦春浇，农民也打破惯例进行小麦春浇。许多农民说：“走着看吧，合作社办好了，秋后咱也入社。”
    但是，干部不从农民这种小私有者的特点和已有的经验出发，引导农民按照自愿互利的原则稳步前进，却硬要粗暴地拖着农民跑步。傅光莹曾要社员们讨论实行“大仓库”共同消费的制度，社员们不同意。社内又过多地扩大了公共财产，把社员的牲口、大小农具都作价归公，连本带息共达五千万元的重债压在社员身上；另外还有百分之八的公积金。社员们提心吊胆地说：“看看麦子长得好，老高兴；想想身上这大的窟窿（负债），又发愁。出这大的力，收下粮食拿不到自己家里，多冤枉！”这不仅使社员情绪动荡，而且使全村农民加深了“怕归公”的思想顾虑，对农业生产合作社望而却步。
    对农民影响更坏的是干部为了“早入社会主义早光荣”，竟在县区领导方面的鼓励、支持下，硬要农民组织所谓“牲口合槽组”（据了解这种组在河南其它地区也不少）。以村长傅光田领导的互助组为例，他强把三个临时性互助组拉在一起，土地分散经营，牲口却作价归公。一方面有些组员出不起牲口价；一方面中农不愿把牲口卖给大家。王玉福把两头牲口入组一头，傅光田和部分组员不依，说：“天下农民是一家，早入‘社会’早光荣”，非让他把另一头也卖掉不可。另外，还要中农出钱搞副业。不久，王玉福、王玉有这两户中农被吓得出了组；贫农王显才出不起牲口草料和副业股金也退了组。剩下的十二户，因领导不民主，制度不合理，不积极生产了；牲口无人关心，也一天比一天瘦了。这种被农民讥之为“三不像”的“牲口合槽组”，如不及早纠正，势必垮台。这些组大都把小牲口变买成了大牲口，一旦垮台，便是一绺算不清的账；不仅影响生产，而且会造成农民内部的不团结。
    干部的盲目冒进、标新立异，造成了农民对社会主义的误解，对党和人民政府的政策的怀疑，阻碍了农民的巨大的生产潜力的充分发挥。“怕冒尖”、“怕露富”、借贷停滞、单纯依靠政府贷款等现象也由此产生。
    农民心里害怕自己的财产没有保障，口里却说：“早入‘社会’早光荣”。他们说：“我们知道干部光喜欢听成绩，好向上级去汇报。”在工作中，谁要是被农民看成是这样的人，那是很危险的！
    “在工作上脱离生产，就会在政治上脱离群众。”确是如此。梁徐店村农民要求增产，要求改进农业技术是迫切的。但是干部不能满足农民这个迫切的要求。春耕生产中在梁徐店村工作的干部不下十余人，这些干部各有各的具体任务，各干各的一套。春耕生产呢，既无专人领导，又无具体任务和计划。“生产是压倒一切的中心”在这里成了空洞的口号。干部号召农民改进农业技术，但自己却连普通的农业技术也不懂。干部动员农民棉花选种，但自己不认识什么是斯字棉。
    去年秋天，干部号召农民进行小麦密植，全村农民有这样几种态度：少数村干部和劳动模范相信密植好，自己也有耕作技术和经验。多数青年人盲目拥护密植，但自己缺乏耕作技术和经验。多数农民对密植半信半疑，有的比过去种得略密些，有的密植一二亩试试看。还有少数富有耕作经验的老农反对小麦密植。结果全村小麦只有大约百分之四十是密植的。
    一件新事物的胜利总是要经过严重斗争的。梁徐店村农民对于密植正处在先进思想与保守思想的激烈斗争中。农民根据自己的经验：稠麦肥料不足长不起来，长起来到成熟期也容易倒伏。今年的密植麦有没有把握长起来而又不倒伏呢？农民非常担心。有的一天去自己的麦田看几次，有的呆望着因肥料不足而发黄的麦苗叹气。农民见了农场的干部，老远就亲切地打招呼，要求到自己家里去吃饭，希望能够学到保证小麦增产的技术。
    很显然，保证小麦增产是农民的突出的要求，也是先进的密植技术能否在全村农民思想上取得胜利的决定一环。要保证小麦增产和春播工作的胜利，首先要解决肥料问题。 
    在梁徐店村工作的干部并没有领导和发动农民开展积肥运动。干部号召农民施用化学肥料，经济部门却因为这样手续，那样制度，迟迟不把肥料贷到农民手里。有的农民买来了化学肥料，干部又不会指导农民施用。有的农民询问密植棉花如何合理施肥，干部也答不出来。这些事实，说明了改进农业技术是一件复杂细致的工作，不能以轻率的态度去进行；也说明了我们如果再不认真学习农业技术，就无法领导农民生产。
    梁徐店村干部在工作上脱离了生产的结果，其它的工作，如贯彻婚姻法、卫生工作、整顿代耕、扫除文盲、信贷等一样也没有作好。这十几项工作，从上级各领导部门开会研究，做出决议，制订计划，印成指示文件，逐级布置到乡，这当中要耗费多少人力财力！可是，在乡里贯彻的结果却是：有的因引起群众不满而中途停止，有的只在群众大会点了点名，有的放在抽屉里还没有和群众见面！
    这一切，农民是不满意的，他们要求在报纸上发言：“我们要作的，干部偏不作，我们要说的，干部偏不听，毛主席的政策再好，干部不照办有啥法！”
    “毛主席让反官僚主义，这些官僚主义可得好好反一反！”
    必须作到让农民对我们说真心话，这有严重的政治意义，这是衡量农民对党和人民政府的态度，亦即我们和农民群众的关系问题的标尺。实际上农民是愿意对我们说真心话的，只要我们虚心去听。
