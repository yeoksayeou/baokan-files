    To All Childcare Workers and Comrades in Children's Education
    Song Qingling
    Comrades: I take this opportunity of International Children's Day to extend my warm congratulations to you. This festival is not only for children, but in fact, it is also your festival. Because when summing up your work, you can see the fruits of your own labor in the celebrations of the children you have nurtured.
    Children's Day is a time for you to generally look back on children's work, and especially to review the part of the work you have undertaken. I think the latter is very important. How sensitive children are! The smallest actions and even all the habits of childcare workers are learned by them. Nothing escapes their little eyes and little ears. This is true in nursery work, and it is the same in all children's work. This shows us that all children's workers should have high talent. They should lead by example and use their own attitudes and actions to educate and influence children. If they simply regard children's work as a profession, they will not do the work well. However, our comrades who work with children, as long as they truly love children, and believe that helping to cultivate our children to become outstanding citizens of New China is a glorious task, and therefore use all their strength to improve themselves and improve their work, they will have found the most suitable job, and they will be respected and supported by the people of China.
    The period of China's industrial construction has begun. We are faced with a complex and arduous task. The children you nurture and teach will soon contribute their labor and creativity. I say "soon" because in these busy days, time flies so fast that before you even realize it, these little brothers and sisters are no longer so small, and their little hands that explore everywhere have rapidly turned into the skilled hands of workers and technicians. For these reasons, children's workers must work harder to improve themselves and improve their work, not only to learn new skills, but also to create new skills. I feel that this work is the lifeblood of our future, and it is now in the hands of appropriate personnel. I believe that the vast majority of children's workers will certainly move towards this path, will certainly make their work more glorious, and will certainly serve our great motherland solemnly. On this International Children's Day, I wish you all happiness! (Xinhua News Agency)

    致全体儿童保育工作者和儿童教育工作的同志们
    宋庆龄
    同志们：我趁国际儿童节的机会，向你们致热烈的祝贺。这个节日不只是儿童们的节日，事实上也是你们的节日。因为在总结工作的时候，你们能够从你们所培育的儿童们的庆祝活动中，看到你们自己工作的收获。
    儿童节是你们一般地回顾到儿童工作的时候，也特别是你们回顾到自己所担任的一部分工作的时候，我认为，后一点是很重要的。孩子们是多么敏感啊！保教人员的最微小的举动以至一切的习惯，他们都要学的。任何事情都逃不过他们的小眼睛，小耳朵。在托儿所工作中固然如此，在一切的儿童工作中都是同样的。这向我们说明了：所有儿童工作者都应该有高度的才干，他们应该以身作则，用自己的态度和行动来教育影响孩子们，如果单纯把儿童工作当做一种职业，那并不会把工作做好。可是，我们的儿童工作者同志们，只要是真正爱护儿童的，相信自己帮助培养我们的儿童成为新中国优秀的公民是一种光荣的任务，因而用一切力量来提高自己和改进工作，他们就是找到了最适当的工作岗位，而且他们将会得到全中国人民的尊敬和支持。
    中国工业化建设的时期已经开始了。我们面临着一个复杂和艰巨的任务。你们所培育和教导的儿童，不久就将贡献出他们的劳动和创造。我说“不久”，是因为在这样繁忙的日子里，时间真像飞一样的快，在你们尚未感觉到以前，这些小弟弟们和小妹妹们已经不再是那么小了，他们到处摸索的小手已经飞速地变成工人的和技术人员的熟练的双手了。正因为这些理由，儿童工作者更要努力提高自己改进工作，不仅要学习新的技术，还必须创造新的技术，我觉得这件工作是我们未来生命的血液，现在是掌握在适当的人员手里了。我相信，绝大多数的儿童工作者将一定会向着这条道路迈进，将一定会使他们的工作更加光荣，将一定会庄严地为我们伟大的祖国服务。在这个国际儿童节日里，谨祝你们全体幸福！    （新华社）
