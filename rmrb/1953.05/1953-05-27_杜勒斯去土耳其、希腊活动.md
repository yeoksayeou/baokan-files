Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: After his activities in India and Pakistan, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles left Karachi on the 25th for Turkey and Greece to continue his so-called "fact-finding trip."

Ignoring the appeals of people all over the world for peace and the easing of international tensions, Dulles continued to promote America's war plans and engage in activities to organize a Middle East aggressive bloc during his "visits" to India and Pakistan. On the 22nd, before going to Pakistan, Dulles held a press conference in New Delhi. At the meeting, he openly advocated organizing a Middle East aggressive bloc, saying, "I believe it is important to establish a regional defense organization in the Middle East."

Dulles's conspiratorial activities aroused angry protests from the people of India and Pakistan. The Communist Party of Pakistan issued a statement on the 25th opposing Dulles's "visit" to Pakistan. The statement denounced Dulles's efforts to organize a Middle East aggressive bloc. Prior to this, large-scale mass rallies and demonstrations protesting Dulles's "visit" to India were held throughout India.

    杜勒斯去土耳其、希腊活动
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯在印度和巴基斯坦进行活动以后，已于二十五日从喀喇蚩前往土耳其与希腊，继续进行他的所谓“调查事实的旅行”。
    杜勒斯不顾全世界人民要求和平与缓和国际紧张局势的呼声，在“访问”印度和巴基斯坦时继续鼓吹美国的战争计划，并从事组织中东侵略集团的活动。二十二日，杜勒斯在去巴基斯坦之前，在新德里举行了一次记者招待会。他在会上公开主张组织中东侵略集团，他说：“我相信在中东建立一个区域性的防御组织是重要的。”
    杜勒斯的阴谋活动激起了印度和巴基斯坦人民的愤怒抗议。巴基斯坦共产党在二十五日发表声明，反对杜勒斯“访问”巴基斯坦。声明斥责杜勒斯竭力进行筹组中东侵略集团的活动。在这以前，印度各地举行了大规模的抗议杜勒斯“访问”印度的群众大会和示威游行。
