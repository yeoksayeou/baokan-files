    CPC Daming County Committee Convenes Agricultural Labor Model Symposium
    Inspects and Corrects the Bad Habit of Falsely Reporting Achievements
    The CPC Daming County Committee recently convened a symposium of agricultural labor models to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and to inspect the bad habit of falsely reporting production achievements. At the symposium, the CPC Daming County Committee first affirmed the achievements of agricultural labor models in the county in leading farmers to carry out patriotic production increase campaigns in recent years. At the same time, it focused on reviewing the shortcomings in the past leadership of agricultural labor models, such as using them too much and educating them too little, praising them too much and criticizing them too little, and liking them to report achievements but disliking them to report shortcomings. It further exposed the ideas of being fond of greatness and seeking quick success and instant benefits that produced these shortcomings. Inspired by the CPC Daming County Committee's sincere review, the 101 agricultural labor models who participated in the symposium also made self-criticisms. The results of the review proved that reporting more than less and exaggerating achievements was quite common; reporting something as existing when it did not, and fabricating achievements, although a minority, was serious in nature. This profoundly educated the county and district cadres and agricultural labor models who attended the meeting. Ren Chengxiu, a provincial agricultural labor model from Beilizhuang Village, realized after his self-criticism that falsely reporting achievements had made him arrogant and detached from the masses. He said: "I made falsehoods myself, and I also suspected that others were making falsehoods, so I was unwilling to learn from others anymore. This is very wrong." The reasons for the false reporting of achievements, in addition to the county and district cadres' ideas of seeking quick success and instant benefits, also included the agricultural labor models' personal ideas of fame and profit, such as "rushing to be first" and "competing for merit"; they made big talk and braggadocio when setting plans or challenges, and then made false reports when they couldn't actually do it. At the meeting, this kind of personal pursuit of fame and profit was also strictly criticized. After the meeting, the agricultural labor models revised the production plans for their respective mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives based on the actual output of the past year and the possible investment capacity this year, and the confidence in increasing production was greatly enhanced. After returning to their villages, many agricultural labor models also reviewed their past mistakes of falsely reporting achievements to the farmers in their entire team or cooperative and in the entire village. The farmers in various villages were very satisfied with the CPC Daming County Committee's help to the agricultural labor models in correcting their shortcomings. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中共大名县委召开农业劳动模范座谈会
    检查和纠正假报成绩的不良作风
    中共大名县委员会在最近召开了农业劳动模范座谈会，开展批评和自我批评，检查了假报生产成绩的不良作风。座谈会上，中共大名县委员会首先肯定了全县农业劳动模范几年来带动农民开展爱国增产竞赛运动的成绩，同时着重检讨了过去对农业劳动模范领导的缺点，如使用多、教育少，表扬多、批评少，喜欢农业劳动模范们报成绩、不喜欢报缺点等，并进一步揭发了产生这种缺点的好大喜功、锦标主义的思想。经过中共大名县委员会虚心检讨的启发，参加座谈会的一百零一名农业劳动模范也纷纷作了检查。检查结果证明：以少报多、夸大成绩是相当普遍的；以无报有、捏造成绩虽是少数，但性质却是严重的。这使到会的县、区干部和农业劳动模范都受到了深刻的教育。北李庄村的省农业劳动模范任成修检查后，认识到假报成绩已使自己自高自大、脱离群众。他说：“我自己造了假，也猜想别人有假，就不愿再向别人学习。这是非常错误的。”造成假报成绩的原因，除了县、区干部的锦标主义思想外，农业劳动模范们存在着的“抢先”、“争功”的个人名利思想也是原因之一；他们订计划或挑战时说大话、吹大气，实际作不到时就作假报告。在会上，这种个人名利思想也受到了严格的批判。会后，农业劳动模范们都根据自己互助组或农业生产合作社去年的实际产量和今年可能的投资能力，修订了全组或全社的生产计划，增产信心大大提高。不少农业劳动模范回村后，还向全组或全社及全村农民，检讨了自己过去假报成绩的错误。各村农民对中共大名县委员会帮助农业劳动模范改正缺点，非常满意。　（新华社）
