Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th: The Anglo-Egyptian talks regarding the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone, which began on April 27th, have been declared adjourned indefinitely on May 6th because the two sides were unable to reach an agreement.

Although the joint communique issued by the British and Egyptian governments only vaguely stated that the talks had "reached a stage where another round of negotiations needs to be scheduled for a later date," without revealing the reasons for the lack of progress in the ten days of negotiations, news from British and other bourgeois news agencies revealed that the main problem was that Britain did not actually want to withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone. On the one hand, Britain verbally expressed its willingness to withdraw its troops and "respect the national aspirations of Egypt"; on the other hand, it insisted that before discussing the withdrawal of troops, it must first ensure so-called "adequate defense" of the Suez Canal Zone after the British troops withdrew, and demanded that Egypt hire six thousand British "experts" to manage the military bases in the Suez Canal Zone after the British troops withdrew. Egyptian newspapers pointed out that this was Britain's attempt to continue occupying the Suez Canal Zone in another way.

    关于撤退苏彝士运河区英军问题
    英埃谈判无限期休会
    【新华社八日讯】开罗消息：四月二十七日开始的关于撤退苏彝士运河区英国驻军问题的英埃谈判，因为双方没有能够达成协议，已在五月六日宣告无限期休会。
    虽然英埃两国政府发表的联合公报只是很隐晦地说，这个谈判已“达到需要在以后再订期举行下一次谈判的阶段”，而没有公布十天来谈判没有进展的原因。但据英国等资产阶级通讯社消息透露，主要问题是：英国实际上不想撤出苏彝士运河区。英国一方面口口声声说愿意撤退驻军，“尊重埃及民族愿望”；一方面却坚持在谈撤退驻军问题之前，要先保证在英军撤退后苏彝士运河区应有所谓“适当的防御”，并要求在英军撤退后埃及要雇用六千个保管苏彝士运河区军事基地的英国“专家”。埃及报纸指出，这是英国企图用另一种方式继续占领苏彝士运河区。
