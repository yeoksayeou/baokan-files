Comrades and compatriots,

It has been two years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Thanks to the support of compatriots across the country, the assistance of the people of Kang and Tibet, the cooperation of fraternal troops, and the victorious inspiration of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, the PLA troops stationed in Tibet have victoriously entered the frontier of the motherland and are engaged in production and construction. On behalf of all comrades of the troops stationed in Tibet, I extend my greetings to you and briefly report on the situation of the troops stationed in Tibet over the past two years, in order to thank you for your concern.

Tibet, the plateau known as the "Roof of the World," is located on the southwest border of the motherland. Its territory is covered with towering mountains, with an average altitude of over 4,000 meters. There are snow-capped mountains, boundless grasslands, continuous forests, and abundant mineral resources.

The Tibetan people are a simple, kind, hardworking, and brave nation with a long history and culture. For over a thousand years, they have been devout Buddhists. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni are the leaders of Tibetan Buddhism. The Potala Palace in the western suburbs of Lhasa, which is thirteen stories high, stands majestically on the hilltop and is a great architectural achievement of the Tibetan people. In the history of the struggle against imperialism, the Tibetan people have also had a glorious page in resisting foreign aggression and defending the motherland. However, since the forces of imperialism invaded Tibet, China's reactionary rulers have been weak and incompetent, adopting a policy of oppressing ethnic minorities, and due to inconvenient transportation, the Tibetan national economy has been unable to develop for a long time, and the population has been declining. Due to the instigation of imperialism, the relationship between the Tibetan people and the motherland was once estranged, and disunity also appeared within the nation.

The victory of the Chinese People's War of Liberation brought a dawn of happiness to the Tibetan people and opened up broad prospects for development. On May 23, 1951, representatives of the Tibetan local government and representatives of the Central People's Government signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." Since then, the Tibetan people have begun to break away from the shackles of imperialism for many years and have returned to the friendly and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, joining hands with all fraternal ethnic groups to shoulder the great task of building the motherland and the border areas. The broad masses of Tibetan compatriots have also begun to bask in the sunshine of Chairman Mao, happily creating their own happy country and living a peaceful and new life.

The PLA troops stationed in Tibet entered Tibet in accordance with the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." In order to help the Tibetan people liberate themselves and consolidate national defense, over the past two years, the troops stationed in Tibet have vigorously assisted the personnel of the Central People's Government stationed in Tibet and have done many things beneficial to the Tibetan people and welcomed by Tibetan compatriots in the economic, cultural, and health fields. In accordance with Article 9 of the "Agreement," which stipulates "gradually developing the language, writing, and school education of the Tibetan nationality," and Article 10, which stipulates "gradually developing Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce, and improving the people's living standards," the Lhasa Primary School was established with public funds, the Telecommunications Bureau was established, Tibetan telegrams were published, mobile medical teams and veterinary teams were organized, people's hospitals were established, a serum manufacturing plant was established, and trade companies and people's banks were established to purchase local specialties and issue interest-free agricultural, industrial, and livestock loans, etc. Through these efforts, the lives of the Tibetan people have been initially improved, and their appearance has been renewed, paving a bright path for the development of Tibet in the future.

The PLA troops stationed in Tibet are faithful implementers of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, a fighting force defending the southwest border of the motherland, and also a production force for long-term construction in Tibet. They know that the full implementation of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" is the greatest interest of the Tibetan people at the present stage, and it is also the highest expression of all the troops stationed in Tibet wholeheartedly serving the Tibetan people to the end; they know that in order to help the Tibetan people liberate themselves and defend and build the border areas of the motherland, they must do it themselves and build it for a long time.

In the past two years, the troops stationed in Tibet have always strictly abided by the policy of equality and unity of nationalities in the Common Program and faithfully implemented the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," regardless of the harsh environment. They deeply realized that the strict observance of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the concrete manifestation of the Party's policy in ethnic minority areas. Therefore, in actual actions, they always respected the customs and habits of the Tibetan people, respected their freedom of religious belief, and protected Lama temples. Under any arduous and tiring marching conditions, they camped out in the open and did not live in Lama temples, without infringing on their slightest interest. When a certain unit marched, they could not get supplies for a while, and all the commanders and fighters proposed: "We would rather go hungry than violate the policy." The entire army was mobilized to dig wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger and overcome the difficulties. At the beginning, due to the differences in living habits with the Tibetan people, there were also phenomena such as not being able to get used to it, but they quickly realized that this was a national issue and was the result of economic and cultural backwardness and poverty. Therefore, it greatly increased their sympathy and strengthened their will to help the Tibetan people liberate themselves. Mass propaganda, helping the masses with treatment, and helping the masses with labor were all carried out throughout the army. A certain unit organized a rural propaganda tour of 1,800 miles. In 23 days, it held 27 mass meetings, publicized to 3,500 people, distributed 400 copies of propaganda materials, showed 11 films, treated 76 Tibetan people, and conducted visits to nine dzongs (counties). The communications company of a certain unit carried 20,025 loads of water for the masses in half a month, and the artillery company of a certain unit helped the masses build 27 houses, made 38 pairs of doors, 12 tables, sent more than 20,000 catties of firewood, carried more than 3,300 buckets of water, planted 250 trees, and treated the landlords in the garrison. Moved by these practical actions, the Tibetan people took the initiative to take care of the sick soldiers who could not work, sent eggs, and washed clothes for our army. Other troops in the entire army organized farming assistance teams and harvesting assistance teams to help the masses with farming during the spring plowing and autumn harvest seasons. Health personnel from each company generally carried out treatment for the masses in the garrison. Even under the extreme fatigue of the road construction troops, they still did not relax in helping the masses. A regiment of road construction troops also took advantage of the construction gaps to help the masses carry 10,600 loads of water and cultivate 50 mu of land in two months. Through the influence of the above-mentioned model disciplinary actions, the broad masses of Tibetan people called our army "new Han people" and "Chairman Mao's troops, the saviors of the Tibetan people."

The staff of the Central People's Government in Tibet and the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Tibet are not only praised by the Tibetan people for observing policies and disciplines, but more importantly, they show their loyalty to serving the Tibetan people with practical actions of participating in construction themselves. At the beginning of the march, they put forward the slogan of marching and building at the same time. Wherever the troops went, they built there. From the foot of Erlang Mountain all the way to Ganzi, Changdu, and in the Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yadong areas, the once uninhabited wasteland, or the deserted cities and villages, or the cliffs and steep walls, and the rugged and difficult roads, have now appeared with new-style buildings and flat and spacious roads with the arrival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops in Tibet. The new urban area of Ganzi is being built, and Changdu is also undergoing planned construction. In the vast grasslands or remote mountains, you can see small houses, which are all connected from Sichuan to Changdu, with a road maintenance team every 20 kilometers. The famous Ganhaizi used to be just a barren mountain, but now it has been established as a tall building, with red-roofed and white-walled houses surrounded by green trees. Every night, the lights are bright, and the radio broadcasts songs from all over the country. In addition, the ice lake of more than ten miles in front of the gate has become a famous scenic spot on the Kangzang Plateau. In the past two years, the construction troops in Tibet have built more than 1,000 kilometers of highways from Ya'an to Changdu and have built many houses. After the completion of the Liberation Building in Ganzi, they continued to build the "August 1st" Auditorium and dozens of warehouses. Now, from Changdu in the east to Lhasa in the west, construction has started on all fronts. They are determined to overcome all natural obstacles with tenacious labor and a fighting attitude, build the highway to Lhasa, build it to the border of the motherland, and connect the border areas closely with the interior.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa, in addition to undertaking the task of defending the border of the motherland, is also actively engaged in production and construction. They reclaim wasteland for production, build water conservancy projects, build bridges and roads, and build warehouses. In order to build the border areas of the motherland and help the Tibetan people get rid of poverty, they have been wielding shovels and picks for many years. At present, more than 30,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the entire region, and last year, the harvest of grain and vegetables totaled more than 3 million catties. In the "August 1st" farm in Lhasa, the radishes, cabbages, and pumpkins planted have grown to more than 30 catties. According to the experimental results, more than ten kinds of grains can be planted, including corn, soybeans, millet, buckwheat, highland barley, wheat, winter wheat, peas, broad beans, and lentils, and dozens of kinds of vegetables such as radishes, green onions, pumpkins, cabbages, potatoes, and garlic can be planted, and they grow very well. Due to the active production of the People's Liberation Army, the enthusiasm for production of the Tibetan compatriots has been greatly encouraged, many wastelands have been reclaimed, and farmers have also paid attention to accumulating fertilizer and applying manure. According to the statistics of a dzong in Leiwuqi, more than 1,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in one year.

Production and construction are the combat tasks of the troops stationed in Tibet on the Kangzang Plateau. In the past two years, they have been fighting against nature in the grasslands and snowfields, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, holding guns in one hand and picks in the other. They are determined to fight against nature with the spirit of eliminating the enemy and develop the border areas. They said: "No matter how high the mountain is, it is not as high as the ambition of the People's Liberation Army; no matter how hard the stone is, it is not as hard as the bones of the People's Liberation Army." If there are no baskets, they will weave them themselves. If there are no tools, they will solve it themselves. Through ideological education in patriotism, patriotic labor competitions were launched, engineering democracy was promoted, and technical innovations were promoted. They excavated earthwork, from an average of two and a half cubic meters per person per day to three, four, and even more than double the standard work efficiency. When a model communist party member, Zhang Fulin, was working, a stone broke his waist. Seeing that he was about to sacrifice, the doctor came to give him an injection, but he refused and said: "I can't do it anymore, I can't complete the task, save some property for the motherland!" Comrades surrounded him and shed tears. He said: "It is an honor to sacrifice for the construction of the border areas of the motherland, the consolidation of national defense, and the liberation of the Tibetan people. You hurry up to construct, don't delay the work!" When the comrades checked his belongings after he sacrificed, they also found a package of vegetable seeds in his food bag, which he had brought from the mainland when he marched and prepared to sow in the border areas. In order to inherit his legacy, the comrades kept the vegetable seeds, planted them on the newly reclaimed land, and re-ordered the plan, determined to follow in the footsteps of Comrade Zhang Fulin and build the highway to Tibet. Comrade Zhang Fulin is one of the thousands of soldiers in the troops stationed in Tibet. Thousands of comrades in the troops stationed in Tibet are just like Comrade Zhang Fulin: "In order to build the border areas, consolidate national defense, and help the Tibetan people liberate themselves, we will not withdraw our troops until the highway is built, and we will wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people to the end! Build Tibet as prosperously as the mainland."

Tibet is an inseparable part of the great motherland. With the support of the people of the whole country on the basis of national unity and the victorious inspiration of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the troops stationed in Tibet are fully determined to build Tibet well together with the Tibetan nation. They fully believe that with a prosperous and strong New China, there will be a prosperous and strong New Tibet. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will be victorious, the Tibetan people will be victorious, and victory will surely be ours.

    团结藏族人民，为建设新西藏而奋斗
    一九五三年五月二十三日在中央人民广播电台的讲词
    中国人民解放军西藏军区司令员  张国华
    亲爱的同胞们！同志们！
    西藏和平解放已经两周年了，由于全国同胞的支援，康藏同胞的帮助，各兄弟部队的配合，以及英勇的中国人民志愿军胜利的鼓舞，中国人民解放军的进藏部队，已胜利地进驻祖国边疆，并进行生产建设了，我代表进藏部队的全体同志，向你们致敬，并简单地向大家报告一下两年来进藏部队的情况，以答谢诸位的关怀。
    西藏，这块号称世界屋脊的高原，祖国的西南边疆，境内高山绵亘，平均海拔在四千公尺以上，那里有终年积雪的高山，一望无际的草原，绵延不断的森林，蕴藏丰富的矿产。
    西藏民族，是一个淳朴善良、勤劳勇敢，具有悠久历史和文化的民族，千余年来，一直信奉着佛教，达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼，是西藏族佛教中的领袖。拉萨西郊的布达拉宫，高达十三层，矗立山巅，巍峨壮丽，是西藏人民的伟大建筑。为抵抗外来的侵略，在祖国反对帝国主义的斗争历史中，西藏民族也有其光辉的一页。但是，自从帝国主义势力侵入我国西藏以来，中国的反动统治者，懦弱无能，采取了压迫少数民族的政策，以及由于交通不便，使西藏民族经济长期不能发展，人口日趋衰落，由于帝国主义的挑拨离间，也曾使西藏民族与祖国关系一度疏远，民族内部也呈现了不团结现象。
    中国人民解放战争的胜利，给西藏民族带来了幸福的曙光，开辟了宽阔的发展前途。一九五一年五月二十三日，西藏地方政府代表与中央人民政府代表签订了“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”。从此，西藏民族开始摆脱了多年来帝国主义的羁绊，重新回到中华人民共和国祖国各民族友好合作的大家庭中来，与全国各兄弟民族携手团结，担负起建设祖国，建设边疆的伟大任务。广大的藏族同胞，也开始沐浴着毛主席的阳光，愉快地创建自己幸福的国家，过和平新生的日子。
    中国人民解放军的进藏部队，是依据“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”进驻西藏的。为了帮助西藏人民解放，巩固祖国国防，两年来，进藏部队大力协助了中央人民政府的进藏工作人员，在经济、文化、卫生方面，做了许多有益于西藏人民和受藏族同胞欢迎的事情。依据“协议”第九条“逐步发展西藏民族的语言、文字和学校教育”，及第十条“逐步发展西藏的农牧工商业，改善人民生活”等规定，在拉萨举办了公费的拉萨小学，成立电信局，出版藏文电讯，组织巡回医疗队，兽医队，设立人民医院，创建血清制造厂，并成立贸易公司、人民银行，收购土特产，发放无利息的农工牧贷款等。通过这些工作，使西藏人民生活初步得到改善，面貌为之一新，为发展今后的西藏建设，开辟了一条光明的途径。
    中国人民解放军的进藏部队，是和平解放西藏办法协议的忠实执行者，是保卫祖国西南国防的战斗大军，又是长期建设西藏的生产大军。他们知道，全部地实现“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”，就是现阶段西藏人民的最大利益，也是所有进藏部队全心全意为西藏人民服务到底的最高表现；他们知道：为了帮助西藏人民解放，保卫和建设祖国边疆，必须亲自动手，长期建设。
    两年来，进藏部队不管在任何艰苦环境下，一直是严格地遵守着共同纲领中的民族平等团结政策与忠实地执行着“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”。他们切身体会到，中国人民解放军的三大纪律，八项注意的严格遵守，即是党的政策在少数民族地区的具体表现。因而在实际行动中，处处尊重西藏人民的风俗习惯，尊重他们的信教自由，保护喇嘛寺庙，任何艰苦疲劳的行军情况下，都是自行露宿，不住喇嘛寺庙，不侵犯他们丝毫利益。某部进军时，一时供应不上，全体指战员提出：“情愿饿着肚子，也不违反政策”，全军就全部动员挖野菜充饥而度过难关。开始时，因与藏民生活习惯不同，也曾产生看不惯等现象，但是他们迅速体会到，这是一个民族问题，是经济文化落后、生活贫困招致的结果，因此反而大大提高了他们的同情心，增强了帮助西藏人民解放的意志。积极进行群众宣传，帮助群众治疗，帮助群众劳动等工作，就在全军普遍展开。某部曾组织了一次行程一千八百里的下乡宣传，在二十三天中，开群众大会二十七次，宣传群众三千五百人，散发宣传品四百份，放映电影十一次，治疗藏民七十六人，并进行了九个宗（县）的访问工作。某部通讯连半个月为群众担水二万零二十五担，某部炮兵连五个月帮群众盖房子二十七间，做门板三十八付，桌子十二张，送柴二万余斤，背水三千三百余桶，种树二百五十棵，并为驻地房东治疗。为这些实际行动所感动，藏民主动地为我军照顾不能上工的病号，送鸡蛋，洗衣服。其他全军部队，每逢春耕秋收季节，均组织助耕队助收队，帮助群众耕作。各连队卫生人员均普遍展开为驻地群众治疗。即在修路部队极端疲劳的情况下，仍不放松帮助群众工作，修路部队一个团在两个月内，还利用施工空隙，帮群众挑水一万零六百担，耕地五十亩。通过上述种种模范纪律行为的影响，使广大藏族人民均称我军为“新汉人”，“毛主席的队伍，是藏族人民的救星”。
    中央人民政府的进藏工作人员与中国人民解放军的进藏部队，不仅在遵守政策纪律上得到藏胞的称赞，更重要的，他们以亲自动手参加建设的实际行动，来表现为西藏人民服务的忠心。进军开始，他们就提出一面进军、一面建设的口号，部队到了那里，就建设到那里。从二郎山下一直到甘孜、昌都，以及在拉萨，日喀则，江孜，亚东地区，过去漫无人烟的荒地，或是冷落的城市与村庄，或是悬崖陡壁，崎岖难行的险道，现在随着中国人民解放军进藏部队的到达，已出现了一幢幢的新式楼房和平坦康庄的公路。甘孜新市区正在建修，昌都亦正在进行有计划的建设，在广阔的草原，或偏僻的山岗，可以看见一幢一幢的小房子，都是从四川一直联系到昌都，每二十公里就有一所道班。著名的干海子，过去仅仅是一片荒山，现在却已经建立了
    一所高大的楼房，在绿树丛中，红顶白壁。每到夜晚，电灯明亮，广播机传来祖国各地的歌声。加上门前的一个十几里地的冰湖，已成为康藏高原有名的胜地了。进藏的修建部队，两年来，修筑了从雅安至昌都一千余公里的公路，修筑了许多房舍。甘孜接着解放大厦落成后，又继续建设了“八一”礼堂，以及数十幢仓库。现在东自昌都，西至拉萨，又全线动工，他们决心以顽强的劳动、战斗的姿态，克服一切自然障碍，把公路修到拉萨，修到祖国的边疆，把边疆与内地紧紧地连在一起。
    进驻在拉萨的人民解放军，除了担负着捍卫祖国边防的任务外，并积极着手生产建设。他们开荒生产，兴修水利，修桥筑路，建设仓库。为了建设祖国的边疆，帮助西藏人民解除穷困的日子，他们长年累月地挥动着铁锹、洋镐。现在，全区已开垦三万余亩荒地，去年收获粮食蔬菜，共计三百余万斤。拉萨的八一农场，栽种的萝卜、白菜、南瓜，有的长到三十余斤。试验结果，可种粮食有苞谷、黄豆、小米、荞麦、青稞、小麦、冬小麦、豌豆、蚕豆、扁豆等十余种，蔬菜和萝卜、大葱、南瓜、白菜、洋芋、大蒜等几十种均可种植，而且长得很好。由于解放军的积极生产，大大鼓励了藏族同胞的生产情绪，许多荒地已开垦起来了，农民也注意积肥下粪了。据类乌齐一个宗的统计，一年内就开荒一千余亩。
    生产修建是进藏部队在康藏高原上的战斗任务。两年来，他们一直在草原、雪地、风餐露宿，一手拿枪、一手拿镐在同大自然搏斗，他们有决心以消灭敌人的精神，来与自然作斗争，开发边疆。他们说：“那怕山再高，也没有解放军的志气高，那怕石再硬，也没有解放军的骨头硬。”没有筐子，就自己编，没有工具，就自己解决。通过爱国主义的思想教育，展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛，提倡工程民主，发扬技术创造。他们挖土方，由每人每日平均两方半，到三方，四方，以至超过标准工效的一倍。某部模范共产党员张福林在施工时，给一块石头砸断了腰，眼看快牺牲了，医生来给他打针，他拒绝说：“我不行了，完不成任务了，为祖国节省一点财产吧！”同志们围着他流泪，他说：“为了建设祖国边疆，巩固国防，帮助西藏人民解放，牺牲是光荣的。你们赶快去施工，不要耽误工作吧！”当他牺牲后同志们检查他的遗物时，还发现饭包里有一包进军时从内地带来、准备到边疆去播种的菜籽。同志们为了继承他的遗志，把菜籽留下来，种在新开垦的土地上，并重新订了计划，决心踏着张福林同志的血迹，把公路修到西藏。张福林同志是进藏部队千万个战士中的一个，千万个进藏部队的同志，都和张福林同志一样：“为了建设边疆，巩固国防，帮助藏族人民解放，不修通公路不收兵，全心全意为西藏人民服务到底！把西藏建设得与内地一样。”
    西藏是伟大祖国不可分离的一部分，进藏部队在民族团结的基础上有全国人民的支援以及中国人民志愿军胜利的鼓舞，有充分的决心和西藏民族一道，把西藏建设好。他们完全相信，有繁荣富强的新中国，就有繁荣富强的新西藏。在中央人民政府毛主席领导下，中国人民要胜利，西藏人民要胜利，胜利一定是我们的。
