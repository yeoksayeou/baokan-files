    Southwest Financial and Economic Committee Holds Local Industry Conference
    Defining Improving Quality and Reducing Costs as the Primary Tasks
    Song Renqiong, First Deputy Secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Gives Instructions on Organizing and Leading Handicraft Industries

    From April 8th to 14th, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee convened the Southwest Region Local Industry Conference to study and improve the production management of local industries, in order to improve product quality, reduce costs, and meet the needs of the broad masses of people and national construction.
    The conference believed that the work of local industry in Southwest China has achieved certain successes in the past. Most factories and mines have undergone democratic reforms, further stimulating the enthusiasm of workers and increasing production efficiency. Last year, sugar production increased more than threefold compared to 1950, and paper production also increased twofold based on the three major factories. Some factories and mines are carrying out production reforms, and some have solved some key production problems, which has played a certain role in increasing output, improving quality, and reducing costs. For example, the Yunnan Cigarette Factory reduced its costs by 30% in the first quarter of this year. During production reform, the daily output of raw material grinding at the Yunnan Cement Factory more than doubled. After production reform, the product quality of Factory 601 has also improved greatly. However, at present, the production management work of most factories and mines in Southwest China's local industry is still extremely chaotic. Some factories and mines have not even established preliminary planning work. In particular, the currently widespread problems of low quality, high costs, and massive product backlogs are seriously hindering the development of local industries and even threatening the continued existence of some factories and mines. For example, the alkali produced in Yunnan is of such poor quality that it cannot be sold, while local users have to come to Chongqing to buy alkali. Southwest tobacco leaves are shipped to Shanghai to be made into cigarettes and then shipped back, and the cost is even lower and the quality better than that of locally produced cigarettes in Southwest China. Therefore, the conference determined that improving quality and reducing costs are the primary tasks of Southwest local industry in the future.
    The conference believed that given the current situation of many local industrial units in Southwest China, small scale, wide distribution, and complex types, the leadership of provincial and municipal local industries should mainly rely on the local provincial and municipal Party committees and financial and economic committees. The provincial and municipal industrial departments (bureaus) should adopt the method of "grasping key points and driving the general" to lead the local industries. In provinces where the industrial departments have too many units under their jurisdiction, several specialized companies can be organized according to actual needs to specifically manage the work of one industry. In order to achieve the goal of improving quality and reducing costs, at present, all factories and mines should gradually implement planned management. First, they should focus on doing a good job in product planning and supply planning to ensure the completion of product plans, and improve the balanced supply, production, and sales plans. They should carry out monthly and quarterly discussions, inspections, and summaries to improve the planning work. At the same time, they should do a good job in the basic work of planning management—quotas and original records. As for factories and mines that have already established quotas, they should revise the quotas in a timely manner and implement planned management on the basis of advanced quotas. Those without quotas should immediately start quota work on the basis of production reform. Some factories and mines have started production reform, but have not yet penetrated into production, the masses have not been mobilized, and key problems have not been resolved, then they should continue to penetrate into production, mobilize the masses, solve the prominent key problems in current production, and tap production potential to create conditions for formulating quotas. As for individual factories and mines that have not undergone democratic reform, they should start with democratic reform.
    In addition, the phenomenon of imbalance between production and sales and backlog of products in local industry is currently very serious. It not only affects the market but also affects the planned management of factories and mines and the survival of some factories and mines, which must be resolved in a planned manner. The most important reason for the backlog of products is the low quality and high cost of local industrial products themselves. The solution is to resolutely improve quality, reduce costs, and strengthen planning work.
    At the meeting, Comrade Song Renqiong, First Deputy Secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, gave important instructions on future work. He especially emphasized that improving quality and reducing costs is the primary task of Southwest local industry at present, and he asked the representatives to go back and think of more ways and study effective measures. Finally, Comrade Song Renqiong gave detailed instructions on the importance of handicrafts in the national economy, how local industrial departments should correctly handle the existing problems in the handicraft industry, and how to organize and lead handicraft workers.

    西南财政经济委员会召开地方工业会议
    确定以提高质量降低成本为首要任务
    中共中央西南局第一副书记宋任穷对组织领导手工业等问题作了指示
    西南财政经济委员会四月八日至十四日召开了西南区地方工业会议，研究改善地方工业的生产管理工作，以提高产品质量，降低成本，满足广大人民和国家建设的需要。
    会议认为：西南地方工业过去的工作是有一定成绩的。大多数厂矿都进行了民主改革，职工积极性得到进一步发挥，提高了生产效率。去年糖的产量比一九五○年提高了三倍多，纸的产量以三个主要厂计算也提高了两倍。部分厂矿正在进行生产改革，有的已解决了一些生产上的关键问题，对提高产量、质量和降低成本起了一定的作用。如云南纸烟厂今年第一季度的成本降低了百分之三十，云南水泥厂生料磨在生产改革中日产量提高了一倍多，六○一厂经过生产改革，产品质量也有很大改善。但是，目前西南地方工业大多数厂矿的生产管理工作仍异常混乱，有些厂矿连初步的计划工作都还没有建立起来，特别是目前普遍存在的质量低劣，成本高，产品大量积压的问题，严重地阻碍着地方工业的发展，甚至威胁到某些厂矿的继续存在。比如云南产的硷，质量太坏，销不出去，而当地用户却要到重庆来买硷；西南的烟叶运到上海制成纸烟再运回来，成本还比西南本地出产的纸烟便宜，质量也比西南出产的好。因此，会议确定：提高质量、降低成本，是西南地方工业今后的首要任务。
    会议认为：在目前西南地方工业单位多、规模小、分布广和种类复杂的情况下，省、市地方工业的领导，主要应该依靠当地省、市党委和财政经济委员会。省、市工业厅（局）对于当地地方工业的领导，应该采取“掌握重点、带动一般”的方法，在工业厅管辖单位过多的省份，可根据实际需要组织若干专业公司，分别具体管理一个产业的工作。为了达到提高质量、降低成本的目的，目前各厂矿应逐步实行计划管理，首先是抓紧做好产品计划及保证产品计划完成的供应计划，改进供、产、销的平衡计划；逐月逐季地进行计划的讨论、检查和总结改进工作；同时要搞好计划管理的基础工作——定额和原始记录。至于已经建立了定额的厂矿，应适时地修订定额，在先进定额的基础上实行计划管理；没有定额的应在生产改革的基础上立即开始进行定额工作；有的厂矿虽然开始进行生产改革，但至今还没有深入生产，群众没有发动起来，关键问题还没有解决，则应该继续深入生产，发动群众，解决当前生产上突出的关键问题，挖掘生产潜力，为制订定额创造条件；至于个别没有经过民主改革的厂矿，则应从民主改革做起。
    此外，目前地方工业中产销不平衡，产品积压的现象是十分严重的，它不但影响市场，而且影响到厂矿的计划管理和某些厂矿的存亡，必须有计划地加以解决。而造成产品积压最主要的原因是地方工业产品本身质量低、成本高，解决的办法是坚决提高质量、降低成本和加强计划工作。
    在会上，中共中央西南局第一副书记宋任穷同志对今后工作作了重要的指示。他特别强调指出：提高质量、降低成本是目前西南地方工业的首要任务，他要求代表们回去要多想办法，研究有效措施。最后，宋任穷同志对手工业在国民经济中的重要意义，和地方工业部门如何正确地处理目前手工业中存在的问题，怎样组织领导手工业者等问题，都作了详尽的指示。
