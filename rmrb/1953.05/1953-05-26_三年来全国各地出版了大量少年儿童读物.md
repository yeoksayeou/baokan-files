A large number of children's books have been published by publishing houses and juvenile newspaper offices across the country in the past three years. These publications have enhanced children's extracurricular knowledge and helped them consolidate and enrich their classroom knowledge.

According to incomplete statistics from the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government: From 1950 to 1952, more than 2,300 kinds of children's books were published nationwide, with a total circulation of more than 41.6 million copies (excluding picture-story books). Among them, more than 500 kinds of Soviet children's books were translated and published. These publications include more than ten categories, such as novels, poems, fairy tales, dramas, and art works. Children's literature such as "Volunteer Army Uncle and Korean Girl," "A Gift for Stalin," and "Little Crane," the play "When the Peaches are Ripe," and picture-story books such as "The Story of the White Hen," "Rabbit Brothers," and "The Story of the Fisherman and the Goldfish" have become the most beloved reading materials for the vast number of children.

The circulation of the national children's newspaper published in Beijing, "China Young Pioneers," has reached more than 760,000 copies. The "New Children's Newspaper" published in Shanghai and children's newspapers published in Hangzhou and other places have a wide readership. The circulation of children's periodicals across the country is also constantly increasing. Among them, "Good Kid," published in Shenyang, now has a circulation of 94,000 copies per issue; "Young Pioneer," published in Chongqing, now has a circulation of 48,000 copies per issue. The distribution of these newspapers and periodicals is gradually expanding from large and medium-sized cities to small cities and rural areas. They play a significant role in guiding children's learning. Chen Danhua, a child from Beijing, wrote to the editors of "China Young Pioneers" saying: "After reading Zhang Tianyi's 'The Story of Luo Wenyin' in 'China Young Pioneers,' whenever I was having fun and wanted to play a little longer before doing my homework, I would think of Luo Wenyin's firm will to study on time, and I would stop playing."

State organs are paying attention to strengthening the creation and publication of children's books. In January of this year, the "Children's Publishing House," which specializes in serving children readers, was established in Shanghai; the "Children's Literature Award Committee," composed of literary and art workers with the participation of cadres from the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, has begun to select outstanding children's literary works; the "Children's Group" has recently been formed by the Creation Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers to specialize in the creation of children's literary books; the Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government has collected a large number of books reflecting the lives of children in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, as well as national fairy tales, which will be selected, translated, and published successively.

The distribution and supply of children's books in various regions are also improving day by day. Xinhua bookstores in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities have set up stores specializing in selling children's books; many cities' parks, cultural centers, and other public places have established children's reading rooms. Teachers and counselors in schools across the country also often pay attention to guiding children to read extracurricular books. (Xinhua News Agency)

    三年来全国各地出版了大量少年儿童读物
    全国各地的出版社和少年报社，三年来出版了大量的少年儿童读物。这些读物增进了少年儿童的各种课外知识，并帮助少年儿童巩固和丰富了课堂知识。
    据中央人民政府出版总署的不完全统计：一九五○年至一九五二年这一期间，全国出版少年儿童读物二千三百多种，共发行四千一百六十多万册（连环图画未统计在内）。其中翻译出版的苏联少年儿童读物达五百多种。这些读物包括小说、诗歌、童话、戏剧和美术作品等十多类。儿童文学读物“志愿军叔叔和朝鲜小姑娘”、“给斯大林的礼物”和“小仙鹤”，剧本“桃子熟了的时候”以及连环图画“白母鸡的故事”、“兔兄兔弟”和“渔夫和金鱼的故事”等，都已成为广大的少年儿童们最喜爱的读物了。
    在北京出版的全国性的少年儿童报——“中国少年报”的发行份数已到了七十六万多份。在上海出版的“新少年报”和在杭州等地出版的少年儿童报纸，都有广大的读者。全国各地的少年儿童刊物的发行数也在不断增加。其中在沈阳出版的“好孩子”，现每期发行九万四千份；在重庆出版的“红领巾”，现每期发行四万八千份。这些报纸和刊物的发行逐渐从大、中城市深入到小城市和农村。它们对指导少年儿童们进行学习起了很大的作用。北京陈淡华小朋友写信给“中国少年报”的编辑说：“我看了‘中国少年报’上张天翼写的‘罗文应的故事’以后，当我正玩得有味，老想多玩一会儿才去做功课的时候，一想起罗文应按时学习的坚定意志，我就不再玩了。”
    国家机关正注意加强少年儿童读物的创作和出版工作。今年一月，在上海市成立了专门为少年儿童读者服务的“少年儿童出版社”；有中央人民政府文化部派干部参加的由文学艺术工作者组成的“儿童文艺作品评奖委员会”，已开始进行评选优秀的儿童文学作品的工作；中华全国文学工作者协会创作委员会最近已组成了“儿童组”，专门从事儿童文学读物的创作；中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会对外文化联络事务局，已征集了大量的反映苏联和人民民主国家的儿童生活的和民族童话等读物，将陆续选译出版。
    各地少年儿童读物的发行供应工作也在日益改善。北京、上海等城市的新华书店设立了专门出售儿童读物的门市部；很多城市的公园、文化馆和其他公共场所，都设立了儿童阅览部。各地学校的教师和辅导员也经常注意指导少年儿童们阅读课外读物。（新华社）
