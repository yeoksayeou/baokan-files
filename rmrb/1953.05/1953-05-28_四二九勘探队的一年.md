    The Year of Exploration Team 429
    By Our Reporter Wang Qi
    Central Geological Department's Exploration Team 429, after a year of arduous struggle, has strengthened its ranks; all team members have established a firm belief in completing the national plan and serving national construction.

    Team 429 is tasked with finding resources for the construction of a large-scale iron and steel plant in Central China. Since its establishment in May of last year, Team 429 has grown from small to large, overcoming various difficulties, and has conducted geological reconnaissance, geological detailed surveys, trenching, geophysical prospecting, and drilling work in an area of 1,350 square kilometers. Their eight months of work (from May to December last year) exceeded the total amount of work done here by past rulers over sixty years. The total footage drilled in eight months exceeded the original plan by 6%, and the annual task was completed two months ahead of schedule. Geological work is the leading work in exploration. With the joint efforts of all scientific and technical cadres and workers, the tasks for the past eight months of last year were also basically completed, and some work was even exceeded. By the end of December last year, the filling of five geological maps of different scales had been completed; the number of proposed drill holes accounted for 162.96% of the original plan; and large-scale trenching work was also carried out. New ore bodies were discovered in Echeng, Lingxiang, Chengchao, and other places, and new positions were found for further resource exploration work.

    The Daye Iron Mine was discovered more than sixty years ago. In the past, Japanese imperialism carried out plundering exploitation here. They drilled and mined at the same time, taking away the high-quality ore and discarding the relatively poor ore. This has further increased the difficulty of truly finding the resources of the Daye Iron Mine today. After liberation, the geological reconnaissance work of the Daye Iron Mine began in November 1950. After April 1951, the central government paid more attention to the resource exploration of the Daye Iron Mine and increased the exploration efforts. However, due to lack of experience and the fact that some geological personnel had a strong old geological worker style, the phenomenon of being divorced from reality was very serious. Although geological exploration work had some achievements, it was never brought into the right track. Some geological personnel went to Jinshandian once, took a look, and drew a line on the map, saying that Jinshandian had no mineral deposits. Now it has been proven that Jinshandian has quite rich mineral deposits. Some geological personnel did not pay enough attention to drilling work. In September 1951, three drill holes were drilled, two were damaged, and one could not be found. Some geological personnel relied on the capitalist country's set of things they had learned, and their working methods were inconsistent. Even the filling colors and drilling numbers were different. These shortcomings prominently showed one point: geological exploration work was "doing as much as you can," and could not meet the needs of large-scale national construction.

    Team 429 was established in May 1952. At that time, the strength and tasks were very disproportionate. The geological surveying personnel transferred from various places totaled only about two hundred people. In mid-May, one hundred drilling workers were transferred from the Northeast, of whom only sixteen were technicians, and the rest were novices newly graduated from schools. In order to quickly obtain resource data from the Tieshan area and ensure the completion of the national construction plan, Team 429 concentrated its main drilling force in Tieshan and immediately formed the First and Second Drilling Teams to carry out work in the Xiangbishan and Laotieshan areas; in July, the Third Drilling Team was established to search for iron ore in Shizishan and Jianshan. After increasing manpower and drilling rigs, Team 429 established the Fourth and Fifth Drilling Teams to drill for iron ore in Xilei Ershan in Echeng and Jinshandian outside of Tieshan. By this time, all thirty-two drilling rigs were put into operation. Geological, surveying, and geophysical prospecting work were also launched successively in May and June. In terms of geology, three groups were launched in early May to carry out detailed surveys and reconnaissance of Tieshan, Echeng, and Jinshandian in coordination with drilling; after July, it was expanded to four groups to carry out the intrusive body work in Echeng and Lingxiang. In terms of surveying, five groups were organized in mid-May to carry out work in Tieshan, Echeng, and Jinshandian successively. In terms of geophysical prospecting, two small groups were also sent to work in Tieshan and Jinshandian. At this time, a large-scale exploration work focusing on Tieshan was fully launched. Although the work had begun, new problems came one after another. Such a large-scale exploration team including various types of work was unprecedented in Chinese history, and everyone lacked experience. The members of the team came from all directions, with different lives, work styles, and ideas. Originally, everyone had high hopes, but after arriving in Tieshan, everything was in a mess. The workers from the Northeast had no work to do for half a month. The work was not connected, the situation was very chaotic, and people were uneasy. In this situation, the leading cadres clearly recognized one problem: they could not wait until everything was ready before starting work. To complete the national plan, it was necessary to seize the time, adjust the organization, establish institutions, and formulate preliminary exploration work plans; at the same time, take active actions to prepare machinery, equipment, water and electricity equipment, houses, construction sites, and factories. Seize the link of learning and quickly grow strength.

    At that time, the biggest difficulty for Team 429 was the problem of material supply. At the beginning, the leading cadres did not understand the seriousness of this problem, which led to frequent work stoppages due to waiting for materials in June and July of last year. Due to drought and lack of rain, water pumps and water pipes were not prepared, and the drilling rigs could not be started. The workers had to carry water from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain every day. Sometimes, due to power outages or accidents, the drilling rigs could not be started for half a month. The leading cadres realized the importance of this problem from practice and began to strengthen the leadership of material supply work. At the beginning, there were only two people in charge of material work, but now it has been increased to more than a dozen. Material supply work has begun to improve. Accidents occurred constantly, which directly affected the completion of the drilling plan. From May of last year to February of this year, there were more than 1,600 accidents of various sizes. The leading cadres learned from this painful lesson, and since February of this year, the entire team has launched a major safety inspection to find out the causes of the accidents. Since February, accidents have begun to decrease. Regarding the issue of cooperation between various types of work, there was also confusion, especially in the cooperation between geological personnel and drilling workers, which caused many problems. At the beginning, drilling workers generally did not pay attention to taking core samples and storing core samples, and simply pursued footage; geological personnel also did not contact the drilling rigs frequently and could not keep abreast of underground conditions. After practical education, geological workers and drilling workers have established a preliminary contact system.

    Learn from each other. The method of mentoring apprentices has a decisive effect on the growth of Team 429. Tang Baolin, the foreman of Drill Rig No. 27, was an apprentice three months ago, and three months later he became a master. The team he led works the best and never has accidents. Most of the workers from the Northeast were originally apprentices, but now 80% of them have become foremen. They taught others and learned more skills themselves. Some local old technical workers, who originally did not know how to use new machines and only knew how to use hand-cranked drilling rigs, can now master the new Soviet-style drilling rigs very skillfully. There are also many apprentices among the geological personnel, and they are progressing very quickly. In less than half a year, some apprentices can work independently. An old technical worker worked with new technical personnel. Seeing that the young technical personnel were progressing so fast, he said: "I must progress and catch up, otherwise I will fall behind!" In terms of drilling, many workers have signed apprenticeship contracts, signing and sealing each other to ensure that they teach and learn on time.

    Team 429 has realized from practical struggle that learning from the Soviet Union is one of the reliable guarantees for completing the national plan and achieving victory in work. In July of last year, Soviet experts came to Tieshan to help Team 429 determine the tasks of Tieshan. Previously, no one dared to give a definite answer as to how much mineral reserves there were in Tieshan. According to the current situation, the figures determined by the Soviet experts are in line with the actual situation. This laid the foundation for Team 429 to complete the national plan in a planned manner. Soviet experts suggested that on the one hand, the Tieshan resources should be drilled well, and at the same time, attention should be paid to the work of intrusive bodies in Echeng, Jinshandian, and Lingxiang. This opinion played a great role in the subsequent work, so that the entire exploration work was carried out in a focused and step-by-step manner, avoiding mistakes. In terms of drilling, Soviet experience was learned, using steel grit drilling instead of diamond grit. This not only saved diamond grit, but also greatly increased the drilling speed. One drilling rig drilled 26 meters of marble in one day and night (in the past, the highest in Tieshan was only 8 meters), creating a new record.

    At the same time, leading cadres also carried out criticism and self-criticism through various meetings, launched patriotic production increase labor competitions, and those who made significant progress in learning and work were commended and encouraged. The thinking of all team members has also gradually become consistent. Then, wages were adjusted and the standards of wage treatment were unified. These tasks also played a great role in overcoming the chaotic phenomena of Team 429 before July. After September, the entire team began to enter normal production and worked together to complete the national plan.

    Team 429 has become a strong geological exploration team. All kinds of arms are complete, and there are many modern equipment and new Soviet-style drilling rigs. In one year, the technical strength of Team 429 has undergone tremendous changes. In May of last year, technical personnel and technical workers accounted for only 16% of the total number of people. By the end of December, it had reached more than 60%. Recently, the entire team once again evaluated technology, and the overall technical level has risen again. From May to December of last year, a total of 128 technical personnel, machine leaders, team leaders, management cadres, and trade union cadres were promoted, greatly strengthening the backbone force. The tasks of Team 429 this year have greatly exceeded the tasks of last year, and the drilling alone has more than doubled. The task is clearly stipulated: to complete the resource exploration report of the Tieshan area before the end of April this year. By the end of this year, the exploration work of the four regions of Tieshan, Jinshandian, Echeng, and Lingxiang will be basically completed, and resource reports will be made. A more arduous task is to train 1,000 technical cadres and technical workers for brother teams within this year. At the beginning of this year, under the circumstances that they themselves were very short of technical strength, they had already sent away forty people. In February of this year, Team 429, combined with summarizing the work in 1952 and rectifying cadres, discussed the plan for 1953. When discussing the plan, the drilling department proposed to create new indicators, raising the monthly footage of each drilling rig set by the ministry from 70 meters to 74 meters. The Tieshan geological work group basically completed the Tieshan geological resource exploration report at the end of April. At the same time, the vanguard team that opened up the new Tieshan has been fighting hard in the surrounding areas. (Attached picture)

    四二九勘探队的一年
    本报记者  汪琦
    中央地质部四二九勘探队，经过一年的艰苦斗争，壮大了自己的队伍；全队人员树立了完成国家计划，为国家建设服务的坚强信念。
    四二九队肩负着寻找建设华中大型钢铁厂资源的任务。从去年五月成立到现在，四二九队从小到大，战胜了各种困难，在一千三百五十平方公里的地区内进行了地质详查、地质精查、槽探、物理探矿、钻探等工作。他们八个月（去年五月到十二月）的工作，超过了过去历代统治者在这里作了六十年的工作总量。八个月的总进尺超过了原计划百分之六，并提前两月完成全年任务。地质工作是勘探工作中的主导工作，在全体科学技术干部、工人共同努力下，去年八个月也基本上完成了任务，部分工作并超过了。至去年十二月底，完成了五个不同比例尺地质图的填绘工作；拟定的钻孔占原计划百分之一百六十二点九六；同时开展了大规模的槽探工作；在鄂城、灵乡、程潮等地发现了新矿体，找到了进一步进行资源勘探工作的新阵地。
    大冶铁矿在六十年以前就被发现了。过去日本帝国主义在这里曾进行过掠夺式的开采。他们一边打钻一边开采，把精良的矿都抢走，把比较坏的矿都抛在一边不管。这更增加了今天真正寻找大冶铁矿资源的困难。解放以后，从一九五○年十一月起，大冶铁矿的地质详查工作即已开始。一九五一年四月以后，中央更加重视大冶铁矿的资源勘探工作，增加了勘探的力量。但是，由于经验不足和有些地质人员带有浓厚的旧的地质工作人员的作风，脱离实际的现象非常严重，地质勘探工作虽也有些成绩，但始终没有纳入正轨。有的地质人员到金山店去了一次，看了一下，就在地图上划一道，说金山店没有什么矿藏，现在证明了金山店矿藏相当丰富。有些地质人员对钻探工作不够重视，一九五一年九月打了三个钻孔，两个坏了，一个找不着了。有些地质人员依靠自己所学的资本主义国家的那一套，工作方法互不一致，连填图颜色和打钻编号都不一样。这些缺点突出地表现了一点：地质勘探工作是“做多少算多少”，不能适应国家大规模建设的需要。
    四二九队是一九五二年五月成立的。当时，力量和任务非常不相称。从各地先后调来的地质测量人员一共不过二百人。五月中旬，从东北调来一百个钻探工人，其中仅有十六名是技工，其他都是新由学校毕业的新手。为了赶紧从铁山本区取得资源资料，保证完成国家建设计划，四二九队集中主力钻探铁山，立即组成了第一、二钻探队，开展了象鼻山、老铁山两区工作；七月又成立了第三钻探队，寻找狮子山、尖山的铁矿。在增加了人力和钻机之后，四二九队又把第四、五钻探队成立起来了，钻探铁山以外的鄂城的西雷二山和金山店的铁矿。至此，三十二部钻机全部开动起来。地质、测量、物理探矿也相继于五、六月展开工作。地质方面在五月初以三组展开铁山、鄂城、金山店配合钻探和地质精查、详查工作；七月以后扩大到四组，开展了鄂城和灵乡的侵入体工作。测量方面于五月中旬组织了五个组，先后到铁山、鄂城、金山店开展工作。物理探矿方面也派了两个小组，到铁山、金山店工作。这时，以铁山为重点的大规模的勘探工作全面展开。工作虽开始了，但是新的问题也一个接一个地来了。这样一个大规模的包括各个工种的勘探队伍，是中国历史上从没有见过的，大家都没有经验。队里的成员来自四面八方，生活、工作和作风都不一样，思想也不一致。原来大家都抱着满怀的希望，可是到铁山以后，一切都是乱糟糟的。东北来的工人，半个月没有工作做。工作接不上头，情况十分混乱，人心不安。在这种情况下，领导干部明确认识到一个问题：不能等一切都准备好了再行动工。要完成国家的计划，必须抓紧时间，调整组织，建立机构，制订初步勘探工作计划；同时以积极行动进行机器、器材、水电设备、房屋、工地、厂房的准备工作。抓紧学习的环节，迅速生长力量。
    当时四二九队的最大的困难是材料供应问题。开始，领导干部不了解这个问题的严重性，以致去年六、七月经常发生停工待料的现象。天旱不雨，水泵、水管没有准备好，钻机无法开动，工人只好每天从山下往山上担水。有时因停电或发生事故，钻机半月不能开工。领导干部从实际中认识了这个问题的重要性，开始加强对材料供应工作的领导，开始仅有两个人管材料工作，现在增加到十几人。材料供应工作已开始改进。事故不断产生，它直接影响着钻探计划的完成。从去年五月到今年二月，发生了大小事故一千六百多次。领导干部吸取了这个痛苦的教训，从今年二月以后，全队展开了安全大检查，切实找出事故发生的原因。二月以后，事故已开始减少。关于各个工种互相配合问题，也曾发生了混乱的现象，尤其是地质人员和钻探工人的配合工作产生了很多问题。开始，钻探工人对取岩心和对岩心的保管普遍不注意，单纯为了进尺而进尺；地质人员也没有经常联系钻机，不能随时掌握地下情况。经过实际的教育，地质工作人员和钻探工作人员已建立了初步的联系制度。
    互相学习。带徒弟的方法对四二九队的成长有决定性的作用。二十七号钻机的班长唐保林，三个月前还是学徒，三个月后变成了师父。他所领导的一班工作最好，从不出事故。东北来的工人，原来绝大部分是学工，而现在百分之八十当了班长。他们教会了别人，自己也学得了更多的本领。有些当地的老技术工人，开始不会使用新的机器，只会使用手摇钻机，现在对苏联的新式钻机，也能很熟练地掌握了。地质人员中也有许多学徒，他们进步极快，不到半年，有些学徒就可以独立工作。有一个老技术人员和新的技术人员在一起工作，他看到青年技术人员进步很快，他说：“我一定要进步，赶上去，否则我就要落伍了！”在钻探方面，有许多工人都订了师徒合同，彼此签名盖章，保证按时教会学会。
    四二九队从实际斗争中认识到向苏联学习，是完成国家计划和达到工作胜利的可靠保证之一。去年七月，苏联专家来到铁山，帮助四二九队把铁山的任务确定了。以前，没有人敢肯定答复铁山究竟有多少矿量。根据现在的情况来看，苏联专家确定的数字是符合实际情况的。这为四二九队有计划地完成国家计划奠定了基础。苏联专家提出一方面要把铁山资源钻探好，同时要注意鄂城、金山店、灵乡侵入体的工作。这个意见在以后的工作中起了很大的作用，使整个勘探工作有重点有步骤地进行，避免了错误。钻探方面学习苏联经验，使用钢砂钻进，以代替金钢砂。这不但节省了金钢砂，而且钻进进度飞快提高。有一个钻机打大理石一昼夜进二十六公尺（过去铁山最高只有八公尺），创造了新纪录。
    与此同时，领导干部又通过各种会议开展批评与自我批评，开展了爱国增产劳动竞赛，学习和工作进步显著的人受到了表扬和鼓励。全队人员思想也逐步一致起来。接着，又调整了工资，划一了工资待遇标准。这些工作对克服四二九队七月以前的混乱现象也起了很大的作用。九月以后，全队开始进入正常生产，共同为完成国家计划而努力。
    四二九队已成为一支强大的地质勘探队伍。各种兵种齐备，还有许多现代化的设备和苏联新式钻机，在一年中，四二九队的技术力量发生了巨大的变化。去年五月，技术人员和技术工人仅占总人数的百分之十六，到十二月底，已达百分之六十以上。最近，全队又一次评定技术，总的技术水平又上升了。去年五月到十二月，共提拔技术人员、机长、班长、管理干部、工会干部等一百二十八人，大大地加强了骨干力量。四二九队今年的各项任务都大大超过了去年的任务，仅钻探一项即超过了一倍以上。任务明确规定：在今年四月底以前，完成铁山本区的资源勘探报告。今年年底，基本完成铁山、金山店、鄂城、灵乡四个地区的勘探工作，做出资源报告。更加艰巨的任务，是要在今年年内为兄弟队培养一千名技术干部和技术工人。今年年初，在他们自己还非常缺乏技术力量的情况下，已输送走了四十人。今年二月，四二九队结合总结一九五二年的工作和整训干部，讨论了一九五三年的计划。在讨论计划时，钻探部门提出要创造新的指标，将部定的每月每部钻机进尺七十公尺，提高到七十四公尺。铁山地质工作组已于四月底基本完成铁山地质资源勘探报告。与此同时，开辟新的铁山的先遣队，已在外围地区作艰苦的战斗。（附图片）
