Readers' Letters Summary

    Cracking Down on Illegal Booksellers' Fraudulent Practices
    —Summary of Readers' Letters
    Readers from various regions have written to expose the egregious behavior of certain illegal booksellers who defraud people of money under the guise of promoting books and periodicals. Reader Wu Dezhong and others wrote to expose that Beijing Private Hong Culture Service Agency frequently sends people to various places to promote books and periodicals, but often sends fewer copies than paid for or does not send them at all after collecting the book fees. In March of this year, the agency's manager, Zhang Yueqiao, even encouraged employees to go out and develop a large number of "subscribers," planning to break up the agency after obtaining the subscription fees; this plan was not realized due to the employees' opposition. Shi Yunyue of the Qindu Town Industrial and Commercial Branch of Hu County, Shaanxi Province, wrote: In January of this year, Liu Lang and Guan Cheng, holding letters of introduction from the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Magazine, came to our branch and requested assistance in promoting the magazine. As a result, our town subscribed to twenty-six kinds of magazines, paying a total of 1.17 million yuan for the books. Afterwards, only one magazine was sent, and then there was no further news. We wrote to the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Magazine to inquire, and the magazine replied that it had notified the Northwest Office to hand over the list of subscribers to the magazine's distribution section for direct delivery each issue, but the magazine still did not arrive. It wasn't until April 18th that we received news that Liu Lang and others were fraudsters and had been arrested in Xi'an. Readers Wang Zongguang of the Second Mine of Fengfeng Mining Bureau, Shang Lao of Fengfeng Mining Bureau, Ma Shiduo of Luoyang County People's Insurance Company of China, and the Luoyang City Taxation Bureau, the Youth League Committee of Jiashan County, Anhui Province, and other organizations have successively written to reflect: The Jinan Youth Book Supply Agency sent people to various places to peddle books and periodicals between April 1952 and January of this year. They subscribed to many magazines at that time and paid for them, but they have never received a single magazine. The readers have repeatedly sent ordinary or registered letters to inquire, but the agency has ignored them. After we learned from the Jinan Post and Telecommunications Bureau, it was proven that the agency is an illegal organization specializing in defrauding book fees and not issuing books and periodicals. The amount of money defrauded in various places has reached 170 million yuan. Sa Shibin of the Fengxiang County Cooperative Union in Shaanxi wrote that the "Labor Books and Magazines Supply Agency" of Wuxi, Jiangsu, promoted books and periodicals in the Fengxiang County area in large quantities last November. The union subscribed to "Economic Weekly" and "Economic Herald" for half a year each, but so far it has only received one issue of "Economic Weekly," and not a single issue of "Economic Herald" has been received to date. Two letters were sent to inquire, but there was no reply. Comrade Xiao Hong of the Hami Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote to expose that an organization called "Zi Yue She" in Shanghai sent a copy of "Beijing History" (Volume 1) in the second half of 1951 and attached a letter stating that the whole book was divided into three volumes, and if you wanted to buy it, you could send the full amount for all the books first. After the reader remitted the money, the agency has not sent the book to date. Some readers also reported that near Jiangshan County, Zhejiang, someone holding a letter of introduction from the Shanghai "East China Cultural Service Agency" was everywhere collecting subscriptions for magazines and defrauding people of money. Later, it was found that there was no such organization in Shanghai at all.
    The fraudulent behavior of the above-mentioned illegal booksellers as exposed in the readers' letters is extremely egregious. Although the Beijing Private Hong Culture Service Agency, the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Magazine, and the Jinan Youth Book Supply Agency have been dealt with by the local people's governments, in order to completely stop the fraudulent behavior of these illegal elements, in addition to the local publishing administrative leading organs strengthening the management of booksellers, it is hoped that the broad masses of readers will be vigilant and not casually subscribe to books and periodicals from people of unknown origin. If they discover any situation of defrauding money under the guise of promoting books and periodicals, they should immediately report it to the local people's government.

    取缔不法书商的骗钱行为
    ——读者来信综述
    各地读者来信揭发某些不法书商借推销书刊为名诈骗钱财的恶劣行为。读者吴德中等来信揭发北京私营红文化服务社经常派人到各地推销书刊，但揽收书款后，经常短寄或不寄书刊。今年三月该社经理张月樵竟鼓动职工外出大量发展“订户”，准备在取得订款后即行散伙；这个企图因职工的反对而没有实现。陕西省鄠县秦渡镇工商分会石云岳来信：今年一月有手持北京工商杂志社介绍信的刘浪、管城二人来我会，要求帮助推销杂志。结果我镇订了杂志二十六种，共付书款一百十七万元。事后只寄了一本杂志来，就再无消息。我们写信给北京工商杂志社询问，该社回信说已通知西北办事处将订户名单交该社发行课每期直接寄发，但以后杂志仍不见寄来。直到四月十八日我们才接到消息，得知刘浪等是个骗子，已在西安被捕。峰峰矿务局第二矿王宗光、峰峰矿务局尚劳、洛阳县中国人民保险公司马世铎等读者和洛阳市税务局、青年团安徽省嘉山县委会等机关先后来信反映：济南市青年图书供应社在一九五二年四月到今年一月间派人到各地兜售书刊，他们当时订了不少杂志，付了书款，但却一直也收不到一份杂志。读者们曾连续去平信或挂号信催询，该社也置之不理。经我们向济南市邮电局了解，证明该社是一个专门到各地骗取书款后不发书刊的不法组织，在各地诈骗的书款已达一亿七千余万元。陕西凤翔县合作社联合社撒世斌来信说：江苏无锡“劳动图书杂志供应社”去年十一月在凤翔县一带大量推销书刊，该社订了“经济周报”和“经济导报”各半年，迄今只收到一份“经济周报”，而“经济导报”至今一份也未收到，去信催询二次，也不见答复。中共哈密地委会小虹同志来信揭发：上海一个所谓“子曰社”的组织，在一九五一年下半年，曾寄发一本“北京史话”（上编）并附信说全书共分三编，如要买可先将全部书款寄去。读者将款汇去后，该社迄今还没寄书去。还有读者反映：在浙江江山县附近，有人持上海“华东文化服务社”的介绍信到处代订杂志骗钱，后据调查，上海根本没有这个机构。
    上述读者来信所揭发的不法书商到处招摇撞骗的情况是极端恶劣的。北京私营红文化服务社、北京工商杂志社和济南市青年图书供应社虽已经当地人民政府处理，但要彻底制止这些不法之徒的诈骗行为，除了各地出版行政领导机关应加强对书商的管理外，希望广大读者提高警惕，不要随便向来历不明的人订购书刊，如发现借推销书刊之名骗钱的情况后，应该立即向当地人民政府检举。
