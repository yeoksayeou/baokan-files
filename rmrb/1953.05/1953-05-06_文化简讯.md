“Exhibition of Woodcuts by Japanese People's Artists”
Opens in Beijing on the 5th

The "Exhibition of Woodcuts by Japanese People's Artists," sponsored by the All-China Association of Fine Arts Workers, opened on May 5th in the Hall of Joyful Hearts in Beihai Park, Beijing. The exhibition includes over one hundred single-color and multi-color woodcuts by more than twenty famous Japanese people's artists. Most of these works were donated to the All-China Association of Fine Arts Workers by the Japan Print Movement Association. The content of the works mostly reflects the Japanese people's struggle against the bloody rule of the Yoshida government and American imperialism, against the militarization of Japan into a military base, and for peace and democracy. For example, the sixteen woodcuts titled "May 1, 1952" depict many vivid scenes of the mass rally and large-scale demonstration held in Tokyo on May Day last year; another example is Koji Arai's continuous woodcut "The Story of a Sailor," which depicts the war-weariness of Japanese naval soldiers; Makoto Ueno's "After Hearing the News of Forced Grain Procurement" and Koji Arai's "Farmers Deprived of Land" both depict the suffering of Japanese farmers under the oppression of the reactionary Japanese government. Through this exhibition, not only can we understand today's Japanese people's art, but also further understand the life and struggle of the Japanese people.
