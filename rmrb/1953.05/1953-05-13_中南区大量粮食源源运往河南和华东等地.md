Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 12th: Under the unified plan of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government, the Central and Southern District, a region rich in grain production, is carrying out the second quarter's grain transfer work. The April transfer plan has been completed by more than 92%, and grain has been continuously transported along the Yangtze River and the Yuehan and Jinghan Railways to grain-deficient areas such as Henan and Eastern China. The second quarter is the peak season for grain sales. In order to ensure market supply, the Central and Southern District and Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Hubei and other provinces have successively established grain transfer committees in April, composed of grain, railway, shipping departments, and loading and unloading companies to uniformly lead the transfer work and allocate water and land transportation tools.

In accordance with the needs of the people in the grain-producing areas in the mountainous areas of Central and Southern China, the Central and Southern grain departments have begun to help the people in the grain-producing areas in the mountainous areas to transport the grain that has always been impossible to transport. Since March, farmers in mountainous areas such as Yongming and Rucheng counties in Hunan have been carrying grain over mountains and ridges to Guilin and Shaoguan, totaling 3 million jin. Farmers in mountainous areas of Enshi and Yunxian counties in Hubei have also gathered a batch of surplus miscellaneous grains waiting for external transportation. The Central and Southern grain departments are also preparing to help farmers in the mountainous areas of eastern Jiangxi and western Hunan transport their grain.

    中南区大量粮食源源运往河南和华东等地
    【新华社武汉十二日电】在中央人民政府粮食部的统一计划下，粮产富饶的中南区正在进行第二季度的粮食调运工作。四月份的调运计划已完成了百分之九十二以上，粮食已顺着长江和粤汉、京汉铁路源源运往河南和华东等需粮地区。第二季度是粮食销售最旺的季节，为了保证市场供应，中南区和江西、湖南、广西、湖北等省已在四月份内先后成立了粮食调运委员会，由粮食、铁路、航运部门和搬运等公司单位组成统一领导调运工作和调配水陆运输工具。
    根据中南山地产粮区人民的需要，中南粮食部门已开始帮助山地产粮区人民把历来无法运出的粮食运出。湖南永明、汝城县等山区的农民，从三月以来翻山越岭挑运到桂林、韶关的粮食已有三百万斤。湖北恩施、郧县山区的农民也已集中了一批多余的杂粮等待外运。中南粮食部门还准备帮助江西东部和湖南西部山区的农民把粮食运出来。
