The mediation committee of Dawa Village, Fourth District, Jin County, Liaoxi Province, has been carrying out mediation work very well since its rectification in the spring of 1952. In addition to the mostly simple disputes being mediated orally at any time, they also mediate three or four more complex disputes each month. The disputes they mediate are generally handled reasonably and fairly, so the mediation committee has established prestige among the masses. If any family has a matter, big or small, they go to the mediation committee for a solution. In 1952, only one dispute in the village was resolved by the parties filing a lawsuit in the county people's court.

The first characteristic of the Dawa Village Mediation Committee's work is that it correctly and patiently conducts mediation based on policies and the actual situation of the masses, being responsible to the end, not "mixing mud," nor forcing mediation. For example, when Guan Zhixian's and Han Yongshan's free marriage was obstructed by Guan Zhixian's father, the mediation committee went with the village cadres to persuade Guan Zhixian's father, finally allowing them to marry freely. For families that are not harmonious, the mediation committee helps to improve relations; for those who rashly propose divorce due to trivial matters of life, they patiently persuade them. For example, Liu Shixun's wife often quarreled with Liu because of financial difficulties, and later filed for divorce; the mediation committee persuaded them on the one hand and helped solve their financial problems on the other, and as a result, they reconciled. The woman Zhao Guiyuan was dissatisfied with her husband living in the factory, and because her parents-in-law hit her, she demanded a divorce; after mediation by the mediation committee, they reconciled. Later, Zhao Guiyuan studied very actively and was elected director of the village women's association. For couples whose marital relationship is very bad and cannot be maintained, the mediation committee supports the parties' reasonable divorce requests. For example, Zhang Wenxue's wife, originally a child bride, was often abused, and the marital relationship was very bad, so the mediation committee agreed to their divorce. After the woman remarried independently, she had great enthusiasm for production and learning. In mediating disputes, the mediation committee also pays attention to protecting women's safety and preventing killings and injuries. In the divorce case of Zhao Yourong and the divorce case of Peng Laifang, when the village mediation failed and they were introduced to the district, the mediation committee estimated that the man might kill the woman, so they educated them and escorted them to the district. Because the mediation committee worked so responsibly, no killings or injuries due to marital problems have occurred in the village. The mediation committee also pays attention to caring for or helping to solve problems such as the marriages of revolutionary servicemen and the difficulties in the lives of military families. The mediation committee is responsible to the end for the problems solved. For example, for couples who have reconciled through mediation, they often pay attention to understanding whether they have really reconciled. Liu Shixun said gratefully: "The People's Government takes care of me so well, and is always concerned about our affairs!"

The second characteristic of the Dawa Village Mediation Committee is that it relies on activists, regularly cares about and understands the lives of the masses, and proactively mediates family disputes. The mediation committee is in close contact with activists among the masses and can understand the situation in the village in a timely manner. Whenever they hear of a dispute in someone's home, the mediation committee does not sit in the room waiting, but immediately takes the initiative to go to the parties' homes to mediate, provided that the masses are willing. Many disputes are often resolved just as they are emerging. This not only prevents the expansion of disputes but also maintains the face of both parties, which is conducive to unity. Therefore, the masses reflect: "The People's Government is considering everything for us, and the mediation committee will quickly solve the problem, without delaying work or hurting feelings."

The Dawa Village Mediation Committee not only mediates general civil and minor criminal disputes but also, under the leadership of the village party branch and the village people's government, often cooperates in publicizing policies and laws, especially the Marriage Law. After the director of the mediation committee learned the Marriage Law from the county, he took the initiative to propose to the party branch to publicize the Marriage Law. The branch also attached importance to it, so it decided to publicize the Marriage Law. Village cadres, women cadres, propagandists, and mediation committee members worked together, dividing the work and contracting the publicity to ensure thorough publicity and no incidents. At the same time, a system of regular mutual circular inspections was implemented to check the publicity effect. Because of this, in the past two years, a new atmosphere has gradually emerged in the village: there are fourteen pairs of people who married freely; arranged and forced marriages are no longer seen; there are no cases of beating, scolding, or abusing women; couples and families who are democratic, harmonious, and united in production are increasing; and women's enthusiasm for labor has also increased. In 1952, 84 women in the village participated in mutual aid groups, and more than 90 percent of the women in the village with labor power participated in field labor. The enthusiasm of men for labor is also very high. As a result, the village became a model village of high yield in the county in 1952.

The work of the Dawa Village Mediation Committee is done well for several reasons:

(1) The mediators are all of good character, have close ties with the masses, and have prestige among the masses. (2) After learning, the mediators realize that mediation work is an important work to resolve mass disputes in a timely manner, educate the masses, consolidate the internal unity of the people, and is conducive to the development of production, thus showing a high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility; at the same time, they are willing to study policies in their work. (3) The party and government leaders of the village attach importance to it, and the branch secretary and village head can help find solutions to problems that the mediation committee cannot solve. (4) The county people's court holds regular meetings to arrange and check the work of the mediation committee, and arranges for learning policies and exchanging experiences. Court cadres can also provide specific assistance and guidance when they go to the countryside.

### 辽西锦县大洼村的调解工作做得很好

    辽西锦县大洼村的调解工作做得很好
    辽西省锦县第四区大洼村的调解委员会，自一九五二年春整顿后，调解工作便很好地开展起来。除大部分较简单的纠纷随时口头调解外，他们每月还调解三、四起较复杂的纠纷。所调解的纠纷，一般地都处理得合情合理，所以调解委员会在群众中树立了威信。谁家有个大小事情，都去找调解委员会给解决。一九五二年一年内该村仅一件纠纷是由当事人起诉到县人民法院解决的。
    大洼村调解委员会工作的第一个特点，是针对群众的实际情况，根据政策，正确而耐心地进行调解，负责到底，不“和稀泥”，也不强制调解。如关志贤和韩永山的自由婚姻受到关志贤父亲的阻挠，调解委员会就和村干部一起去打通关志贤父亲的思想，终于使他俩自由结了婚。对不和睦的家庭，调解委员会帮助改善关系；对因生活细故而轻率提出离婚的，则耐心劝解。如刘世训的老婆因生活困难，常和刘吵架，后又提出离婚；调解委员会一方面劝解，一方面帮助解决了生活问题，结果他俩和好了。妇女赵桂元不满意她丈夫住在工厂里，又因为公婆打了她一下，就闹着要离婚，经调解委员会调解后，和好了。以后，赵桂元学习很积极，并且当选为村妇女会主任。夫妻关系十分恶劣无法继续维持的，调解委员会则支持了当事人的合理离婚要求。如张文学的老婆，原是童养媳，经常受虐待，夫妻关系非常坏，调解委员会便同意他们离婚。女的另行自主结婚后，生产、学习都劲头很大。调解委员会在调解纠纷中，还注意到保护妇女安全，防止杀伤事件。赵有荣离婚案和彭来舫离婚案，在村调解未成介绍去区里时，估计男方有杀害女方的可能，调解委员会就对他们进行教育，同时护送他们去区里。由于调解委员会这样负责地工作，该村一直没发生过因婚姻问题而起的杀伤事件。对于革命军人的婚姻、军属的生活困难等问题，调解委员会也注意照顾或帮助解决。所解决的问题，调解委员会都负责到底。如对调解和好的夫妻，经常注意了解是否真的和好了。上述刘世训曾经感激地说：“人民政府对我照顾太好了，一直这样挂心我们的事！”
    大洼村调解委员会的第二个特点，是依靠积极分子、经常关心和了解群众的生活，主动调解家庭纠纷。调解委员会和群众中积极分子联系很紧，村中有什么情况，可以及时了解。每听到谁家有纠纷时，调解委员会不是坐在屋里等待，而是在群众自愿的情况下，立即主动到当事人家去调解。许多纠纷往往刚在萌芽时就给解决了。这样做，既防止了纠纷的扩大，又保持了当事人双方的情面，有利于团结。所以群众反映：“人民政府处处为咱打算，有问题调解委员会很快就给解决了，既不误工，又不伤和气。”
    大洼村调解委员会不仅调解一般民事和轻微刑事纠纷，而且在村党支部和村人民政府领导下，经常配合宣传政策法令，特别是婚姻法。调解委员会主任从县里学习了婚姻法回村后，就主动向党支部提出宣传婚姻法的建议。支部也重视，于是便决定宣传婚姻法。由村干部、妇女干部、宣传员和调解委员一齐动手，分片包干宣传，保证宣传透彻，不出事。同时，还实行了定期互相循环检查的制度，检查宣传效果。因为这样，两年来该村逐渐出现了新的气象：有十四对自由结婚的；包办买卖婚姻看不到了；打骂虐待妇女的事没有了；民主和睦团结生产的夫妇和家庭多起来了；妇女的劳动热情也提高了。一九五二年内，该村有八十四名妇女参加了互助组，全村有百分之九十以上有劳动力的妇女参加了田间劳动。男子的劳动热情也很高。结果该村在一九五二年成为全县的丰产模范村。
    大洼村调解委员会的工作做得好，有几个原因：
    （一）调解委员都是作风正派，和群众有密切联系，并在群众中有威信的。（二）调解委员经过学习，认识到调解工作是及时解决群众纠纷、教育群众、巩固人民内部团结、有利于发展生产的重要工作，因而表现了很高的积极性和责任心；同时肯经常在工作中钻研政策。（三）村的党、政领导方面重视，调解委员会解决不了的问题，支部书记、村长都能帮助想办法。（四）县人民法院定期开会布置和检查调解委员会的工作，并布置学习政策、交流经验，法院干部下乡时也能给以具体帮助和指导。
