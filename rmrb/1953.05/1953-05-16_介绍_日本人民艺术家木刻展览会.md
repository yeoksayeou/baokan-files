Introducing the "Exhibition of Woodcuts by Japanese People's Artists"
Gu Yuan

A few days ago, I went to the Yuexin Hall in Beihai Park, Beijing, to see the "Exhibition of Woodcuts by Japanese People's Artists." I saw the painful lives and courageous resistance of the Japanese people under the occupation of the American army and the rule of the reactionary Yoshida government. I saw the hard work of the Japanese people's artists, and my heart was filled with concern and respect.

Among these works, a set of sixteen woodcuts collectively created by the "Japanese People's Woodcut Group" with the theme of "May 1st, 1952" is particularly eye-catching. This set of woodcuts depicts the heroic struggle of the Japanese patriotic people on the International Labor Day of May 1st, 1952. From these works, we can clearly see the firm will of the Japanese people today to strive for independence, freedom, peace, and democracy.

Many works in the exhibition express the Japanese people's desire to oppose rearmament, oppose wars of aggression, and demand a peaceful life. A set of woodcut comic strips "The Story of a Sailor" by Hiroji Shinkyo depicts a young Japanese man being drafted into the army as a sailor, living a painful life in the barracks, and later being sacrificed in "performing his mission." This set of comic strips uses extremely clear images to express the Japanese people's hatred of wars of aggression. The structure of the story is very tight, and each composition selects the most prominent scene. For example, the first picture, "Physical Examination," shows a young man stripped naked crawling on the ground, supposedly undergoing "examination," but in reality, undergoing "torture"; in the fifth picture, "Hammock Training," the young man is being fooled like merchandise; the sixth picture, "Military Training," shows only a soldier exhausted to the extreme, who no longer has the strength to stand up, which fully illustrates the many cruel processes of forced conscription and so-called "training." This set of paintings has a total of forty-five pictures, each with only a very short title, but the reader can understand the content and plot of the painting at a glance. The knife work is very concise, with very few cumbersome and empty knife marks, and the technique is quite successful.

Another work by Hiroji Shinkyo, "The Victim," depicts an extremely painful mother holding her innocent dead child, with the heavy imprint of car wheels on the ground at her feet. The reader can be sure that the lovely child was crushed to death by a reckless car driven by the American occupiers. Behind the mother and child, an angry crowd surrounds them, staring at the fleeing murderer with hateful eyes.

"Farmers Deprived of Land" is also a work by Hiroji Shinkyo. It depicts three farmers standing silently by the vast field enclosed by barbed wire. The expressions on their faces are deep and firm. It, along with Makoto Ueno's "After Hearing the News of Forced Grain Requisition," depicts the tragic experience of Japanese farmers today and their strong and unyielding character. From these pictures, we see that the Japanese people do not have a pessimistic or disappointed look. There are no tears in their eyes, but stubborn fighting spirit and confidence in victory.

The Japanese people regard the victory of the Chinese people as their own victory. A colored woodcut fully expresses this common feeling of the Japanese people. The painting depicts a pair of young people singing and dancing with great joy, with the words "Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" at the top. The brisk dance and bright colors all appear warm and excited. The author of this woodcut is Kenji Suzuki.

Takidaira Nijiro's colored comic woodcut "The Emperor's New Clothes" is a very good work. The content is a sharp satire on a foolish feudal ruler and some hypocritical Philistines. The author uses appropriate exaggeration to depict extremely vivid images, and the composition and colors are handled very cleverly, appropriately creating the unique style of woodblock prints.

The exhibition features more than 100 works, which are only a small part of the works of Japanese people's artists. But just this part of the work is enough to move us. What the Japanese people are experiencing now is similar to what the Chinese people experienced before liberation. The great victory of the Chinese revolution has greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the Japanese people. The people of China and Japan are united more closely in the struggle to defend world peace and combat common enemies.

In recent years, especially after the Chinese people gained liberation, new Chinese woodcuts have been continuously sent to Japan, and Japanese people's artists have also often sent their works to us. We have also received many enthusiastic letters from them. Through these, woodcut artists from China and Japan have also joined hands closely on the art front. The cultural exchange between China and Japan has enhanced the deep friendship between the people of China and Japan. Let us—the people's artists of China and Japan—unite further and strive for the cause of peace in Asia and the world! (Attached pictures)

### 介绍“日本人民艺术家木刻展览会”

    介绍“日本人民艺术家木刻展览会”
    古元
    前几天，我到首都北海公园悦心殿看了“日本人民艺术家木刻展览会”。我看见了日本人民在美军占领下、在反动吉田政府统治下的痛苦生活和勇敢的反抗行动，看见了日本人民艺术家们辛勤工作的成绩，我的心里充满了关切和敬意。
    在这些作品里，有一套“日本人民木刻集团”集体创作的、以“一九五二年五月一日”为题材的十六幅木刻，特别惹人注目。这套木刻表现了日本爱国人民在一九五二年五月一日国际劳动节的英勇斗争。我们从这些作品中可以清楚地看见今天的日本人民为争取独立、自由、和平与民主的坚决意志。
    展览会上有很多作品表达了日本人民反对重新武装、反对侵略战争、要求和平生活的愿望。新居广治作的一套木刻连环画“水兵的故事”，描写一个日本青年被征入伍当水兵，在兵营里过着痛苦的生活，后来在“执行任务”中牺牲了。这套连环画用极其清晰的形象表现出日本人民痛恨侵略战争的心情。故事的结构非常紧凑，每幅的构图都选取最突出的场面。例如开始的一幅“身体检查”，画面上是一个被剥光了衣服的青年爬在地下，说是受“检查”，其实是受“非刑”；在第五幅“吊床训练”中，那个青年人正被当作货物一样愚弄着；第六幅“军事训练”的画面上，只有一个疲乏到极点的士兵，他已经没有力气站立起来，这就充分说明了强征入伍和所谓“训练”的许多残酷的过程。这套画共四十五幅，每幅都只用很简短的一句标题，但读者一看就能了解画的内容和故事情节。刀法很简练，极少繁琐和空洞的刀痕，技法是相当成功的。
    新居广治的另一幅作品“牺牲者”，刻的是一个表情极为痛苦的母亲，抱着她无辜死去的孩子，脚边地上是汽车轮子沉重地轧过的印子。读者可以肯定，那个可爱的孩子是被美国占领者所驾驶的横冲直闯的汽车所压死的。在母亲和孩子的后面，围着愤怒的人群，他们用仇恨的目光盯视着风驰而去的凶手。
    “被夺去土地的农民”也是新居广治的作品。刻的是三个农民默默地站在被铁丝网圈去的广阔的田边，他们脸部的表情是深沉而坚毅的，它和上野诚的“听到强制征粮的消息以后”，都刻划出了今天日本农民惨痛的遭遇和他们坚强不屈的性格。从这些画面上，我们看到日本人民没有悲观失望的神情，他们的眼睛里没有泪，有的是倔强的斗志和胜利的信心。
    日本人民把中国人民的胜利看作他们自己的胜利一样，有一幅彩色木刻，充分表现了日本人民这种普遍的心情。那画上刻着一对兴高采烈地歌舞着的青年，上端是“庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年”的字样，轻快的舞姿和鲜明的色彩都显得热烈，兴奋。这幅木刻的作者是铃木贤二。
    泷平二郎所作彩色连环木刻“皇帝的新衣”，是一部很好的作品，内容是尖锐地讽刺一个愚蠢的封建统治者和一些虚伪的市侩。作者运用适当的夸张手法刻划出了极为生动的形象，构图和色彩都处理得很巧妙，十分恰当地作出了木板画的特有风格。
    这次展出的作品共一百多件，它们不过是日本人民艺术家们的作品的一小部分。但光是这部分作品已经够使我们感动。日本人民现在所经历的，和中国人民在解放以前所经历的，有许多地方相类似；而中国人民革命的伟大胜利，大大鼓舞了日本人民的斗志。中日两国人民在为保卫世界和平、打击共同敌人的斗争中团结得更紧了。
    近几年来，特别是中国人民获得解放之后，新中国木刻曾不断地送到日本去，日本人民艺术家们也时常把他们的作品寄给我们。我们并收到他们不少热情的来信。通过这些，中日两国的木刻家们在艺术战线上也紧紧地携起手来了。中日两国文化的交流，增进了中日两国人民深厚的友谊。让我们——中国和日本的人民艺术家们更进一步地团结起来，为亚洲和全世界的和平事业而奋斗吧。（附图片）
