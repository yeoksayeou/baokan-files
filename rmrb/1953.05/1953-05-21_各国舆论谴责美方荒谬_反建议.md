    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" and other newspapers published editorials saying
    The US Must Withdraw Their Absurd Proposal
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 20] Pyongyang newspapers all published editorials on the 18th, unanimously condemning the US's "counter-proposal" aimed at forcibly detaining our captured personnel.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" editorial stated: The entire course of the Korean armistice negotiations shows that our representatives have consistently made sincere efforts to fulfill the earnest expectations of the people on both sides who have children fighting on the Korean battlefield and the people of the world. The US, however, has been constantly creating various obstacles and stubbornly hindering the realization of the armistice. The so-called "counter-proposal" put forward by the US on the 13th once again trampled on the hopes of the peace-loving people of the world for a swift realization of the Korean armistice, attempting to forcibly detain our captured personnel under the guise of "on-the-spot release." The editorial emphasized: This absurd proposal of the US is absolutely unacceptable to us. If the US has the desire to realize the Korean armistice, it should immediately withdraw its absurd proposal and accept our reasonable plan.

    The "Democratic Korea" editorial stated: Before the resumption of negotiations, Marshal Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai made a very clear and just statement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation based on the principles of the Geneva Convention. This statement became the basis for the resumption of negotiations and received enthusiastic support from the people of the world. Therefore, the principles in the statement must not be overturned. However, the US has put forward a proposal that is completely different from our proposal, plotting to hinder the armistice negotiations. At the same time, the US barbarously bombed our peaceful cities and towns and reservoirs in the rear, and repeatedly requested adjournments during the negotiations,妄想 (wàngxiǎng - presumptuous attempt/fantasy) vainly attempting to force our side to yield with this vile means. This behavior of the US, leading the armistice negotiations to a breakdown, has once again exposed them as enemies of the peace-loving people of the world. The editorial concluded: The Korean people are determined to carry out a resolute struggle to realize the Korean armistice based on fundamental principles.

    The "Korean People's Army" newspaper's editorial stated: What the US cannot obtain on the front line, it will never obtain at the negotiating table. So-called "military pressure" will not help the enemy's defeated situation. If the US does not accept our just plan, stubbornly adheres to its absurd claims, hinders the realization of the armistice, and further expands the war, then it will inevitably be subjected to just sanctions in front of the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.
    Polish "People's Tribune" Publishes Special Article
    Denouncing the US for Obstructing Korean Armistice Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 20] According to the Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, May 19: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an article entitled "World Opinion Demands an Answer," denouncing the US for obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations.

    The article pointed out: The US's tactics of requesting adjournments in the Korean armistice negotiations, obstructing the negotiations, and the provocative attacks by American aircraft on the territory of People's China are characteristics of the attitude taken by the US towards the Korean issue. World opinion is paying attention to these tactics adopted by the US. The only conclusion that can be drawn from these actions is that, until now, the US government has been evading an immediate armistice in Korea.

    The article pointed out: The tactics of the US delegation and the attitude of the Korean-Chinese delegation form a remarkable contrast. The Korean-Chinese delegation is doing its best to reach an understanding as early as possible. It is due to the initiatives of China and Korea that the negotiations at Panmunjom were resumed, and it is due to the positive attitude adopted by the Korean-Chinese side that the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war was achieved.

    The article then described the consistent efforts made by the Korean-Chinese side to strive for an armistice agreement after the resumption of discussions on the prisoner of war issue; and pointed out that the US counter-proposal overturned the principle agreed upon by both sides of handing over prisoners of war who would not be directly repatriated to neutral countries for custody, and was an absurd plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

    The article said: This absurd "proposal" put forward by the US representative has aroused public outrage around the world. World public opinion unanimously demands the acceptance of the specific and reasonable proposals of the Korean-Chinese side. Even foreign bourgeois newspapers said: "These proposals constitute a real and reasonable basis for reaching an agreement." Some officials in capitalist countries also support this proposal. The proposals of the Korean-Chinese side have opened up great possibilities for ending the Korean War.

    The article concluded: An American news agency reported that the US is drafting a new "counter-proposal." World public opinion is paying close attention to the actions of the United States. World public opinion demands that the US answer promote the fastest possible understanding and the end of the Korean War.
    New York "Daily Worker" Publishes Editorial Saying
    US "Counter-Proposal" Violates the Interests of the American People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 20] The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on May 14 saying: The so-called "new proposal" recently put forward by General Clark to resolve the issue of prisoners of war, "is not only not new, but also does not conform to the interests of the American people." The editorial also said: "The proposal to 'release' Korean prisoners of war -- separating them from Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in the negotiations -- is a malicious conspiracy planned from the outset by the Pentagon negotiators."

    The "Daily Worker" continued: The intention of Clark's "new" proposal is to continue handing over prisoners of war to Syngman Rhee as forced labor brigades, or to attempt to force them to fight for the Syngman Rhee regime, as the Americans have done to many Korean prisoners of war before.

    The editorial reviewed past developments, proving that "Clark's new plan is not a plan for armistice, but a plan to obstruct armistice... a plan to continue the slaughter."

    The editorial concluded: "Eisenhower's policy is isolating the United States from the people of the world, putting the United States alongside the garbage and dregs of various countries - the dregs that are spurned and cleared away by the people of various countries.

    "It is truer now than ever: Unless the American people themselves - first and foremost the working people - rise up to demand an armistice in Korea, the Eisenhower and McCarthy-like government will continue the war, and ultimately attempt to expand it."

### 各国舆论谴责美方荒谬“反建议”

    各国舆论谴责美方荒谬“反建议”
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”等报发表社论说
    美方必须收回他们的荒谬方案
    【新华社平壤二十日电】平壤各报在十八日都发表社论，一致斥责美方目的在于强迫扣留我方被俘人员的“反建议”。
    “劳动新闻”的社论说：朝鲜停战谈判的全部进程都表明，我方代表为了实现有子弟在朝鲜战场作战的双方人民和全世界人民的殷切期望，一贯进行诚挚的努力；而美方却在不断地制造各种障碍，横暴地阻挠停战的实现。美方在十三日提出的所谓“反建议”，又一次蹂躏了全世界善良人民渴望迅速实现朝鲜停战的希望，而企图以“就地释放”的名义来强迫扣留我方被俘人员。社论强调指出：美方这种荒谬提案，是我方绝对不能接受的。美方如有实现朝鲜停战的愿望，那就应该即时收回他们的荒谬提案，接受我方的合理方案。
    “民主朝鲜”的社论说：在谈判恢复之前，金日成元帅和周恩来总理根据日内瓦公约的原则，已对战俘遣返问题作了非常明确的公正声明。这个声明成为恢复谈判的基础，得到了全世界人民的热烈支持。因此，声明中的原则是绝不能加以推翻的。但是，美方却提出了内容和我方提案完全不同的提案，阴谋妨碍停战谈判。同时，美方野蛮地轰炸了我们后方的和平城乡与贮水池，并在谈判中一再要求休会，妄想用这种恶劣手段来迫使我方屈服。美方这种把停战谈判引向破裂道路的行为，已再次暴露了他们是世界爱好和平人民的敌人。社论最后说：朝鲜人民决心根据基本原则，为实现朝鲜停战而进行坚决的斗争。
    “朝鲜人民军”报的社论说：美方在前线所得不到的东西，在谈判会议上也是永远得不到的。所谓
    “军事压力”也不会对敌人的失败处境有所帮助。如果美方不接受我方的公正方案，固执自己的荒谬主张，阻挠停战实现，并进而扩大战争；那么，他们就必将在朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的面前受到正义的制裁。波兰“人民论坛报”发表专文
    斥责美方阻挠朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社二十日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙十九日讯：波兰“人民论坛报”刊载一篇题目是“世界舆论要求答复”的文章，斥责美方阻挠朝鲜停战谈判。
    文章指出：美方要求朝鲜停战谈判休会、阻挠谈判的策略，以及美国飞机对人民中国领土的挑衅袭击，是美国对朝鲜问题所采取的态度的特点。世界舆论正在注意美方采取的这些策略。由这类行动所能得出的唯一结论就是，直到现在，美国政府正在规避立即达成朝鲜停战。
    文章指出：美方代表团的策略和朝中代表团的态度形成显著的对比。朝中代表团尽力使谅解尽早达成。正是由于中国和朝鲜的创议，板门店的谈判才得以恢复，正是由于朝中方面采取了积极的态度，才使病伤战俘的遣返得以实现。
    文章接着叙述了在战俘问题的讨论恢复后，朝中方面为争取达成停战协议所作的一贯的努力；并指出，美方的反建议，推翻了双方同意的将不直接遣返的战俘交由中立国看管的原则，是一个企图强迫扣留战俘的荒谬方案。
    文章说：美方代表提出的这个荒谬“建议”已引起全世界的公愤。世界公众舆论一致要求接受朝中方面的具体的合理的建议。甚至外国资产阶级的报纸也说：“这些建议构成了一个真正的、合理的基础，以达成协议。”资本主义国家的某些官方人士也支持这个建议。朝中方面的建议为结束朝鲜战争开辟了极大的可能。
    文章最后说：一个美国通讯社报道，美方正在拟订新的“反建议”。世界公众舆论非常注意美国的举动。世界公众舆论要求美方的回答促成尽可能迅速的谅解以及朝鲜战争的结束。纽约“工人日报”发表社论说
    美方“反建议”违反美国人民利益
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】纽约“工人日报”五月十四日发表社论说：克拉克将军最近提出的解决战俘问题的所谓“新建议”，“不但一点不新，并且也不符合美国人民的利益”。社论又说：“‘释放’朝鲜战俘——在谈判中把他们和中国人民志愿军战俘分开来——的建议，是国防部谈判代表们一开始就计划好的恶毒阴谋”。
    “工人日报”接着说：克拉克的“新”建议的意图是要继续把战俘交给李承晚作为强迫劳工队，或者企图强迫他们为李承晚政权作战，正如美国人以前对许多朝鲜战俘所做的那样。
    社论回顾过去的发展，证明“克拉克的新方案并不是想要停战的方案，而是阻挠停战……继续进行屠杀的方案”。
    社论最后说：“艾森豪威尔的政策正使美国脱离世界人民而孤立起来，使美国和各国的垃圾和渣滓——为各国人民所唾弃的和清除的渣滓——并列在一起。
    “现在比任何时候都更真实：除非美国人民自己——首先是劳动人民——起来要求在朝鲜停战，否则艾森豪威尔和麦卡锡之流相勾结的政府将继续战争下去，并且最后企图把它加以扩大”。
