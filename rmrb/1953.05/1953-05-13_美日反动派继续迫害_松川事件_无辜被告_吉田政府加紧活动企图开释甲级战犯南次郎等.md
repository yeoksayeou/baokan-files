Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident," which is of concern to progressive people worldwide, is about to enter the judgment phase. The US and Japanese reactionaries have not abandoned their vicious conspiracy to frame the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and are preparing to impose fabricated charges on them.

At the end of 1951, under the protest of righteous people in Japan and abroad, the Yoshida government was forced to decide to retry the "Matsukawa Incident." Up to now, the Sendai High Court has conducted more than 70 retrials and investigations into this case. During the public trials, various facts and evidence have repeatedly proved that the judgment in the first trial was unfounded, and at the same time confirmed that this was a political conspiracy fabricated by the Yoshida government to frame the Japanese Communist Party and patriots.

However, despite this, the prosecutors who served the Japanese reactionaries unreasonably demanded in the public trial on April 28 that the court authorities maintain the unreasonable judgment in the first trial, sentencing five of the innocent defendants to death, five to life imprisonment, and the other ten to various terms of imprisonment. The Sendai High Court has decided to hold the second trial judgment in early July. Various trade union organizations and progressive groups in Japan are continuing to launch support movements for the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The Central Committee of the All-Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union passed a resolution in February this year to launch a movement demanding the release of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The Japan National Relief Association is also calling on the Japanese people to widely write to Suzuki, the presiding judge of the Sendai High Court responsible for handling the "Matsukawa Incident," demanding that he quickly release all innocent defendants.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Activities to release Japanese war criminals are continuing with the collusion of the Yoshida government and the US government.

The Yoshida government has long been actively working to exonerate Class A war criminals. In early April, the Yoshida government formally proposed to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and other eight countries, requesting the release of three Class A war criminals first: former Army General Nanjirō, Sadao Araki, and Shunroku Hata. Kyodo News Agency revealed that the Yoshida government is also preparing to successively propose the release of other Class A war criminals.

The US government's work to release Class B and Class C Japanese war criminals ahead of schedule is also continuing. On the 6th, the US government notified the Japanese government again, approving the "parole" of five Japanese war criminals. Since the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, the United States has successively "paroled" 53 Japanese war criminals.

    美日反动派继续迫害“松川事件”无辜被告
    吉田政府加紧活动企图开释甲级战犯南次郎等
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：为全世界进步人民所关怀的“松川事件”的第二审即将进入判决阶段。美、日反动派依然没有放弃陷害“松川事件”无辜被告的毒辣阴谋，准备以莫须有的罪名加在他们身上。
    一九五一年年底，在日本国内外正义人民的抗议下，吉田政府曾被迫决定对“松川事件”重新审判。到现在为止，仙台高等裁判所对这一案件一共进行了七十多次复审和调查。在公审期中，各种事实和证据都一再证明第一审中的判决是毫无根据的，同时证实了这是吉田政府为陷害日本共产党和爱国者而捏造的政治阴谋。
    但是，尽管如此，为日本反动派服务的检察人员仍然在四月二十八日的公审中无理地要求法庭当局维持第一审中的无理判决，将无辜被告中的五名判处死刑，五名判处无期徒刑，另外的十名分别判处各种的有期徒刑。仙台高等裁判所已经决定在七月上旬举行第二审的判决。日本各工会组织和进步团体对于“松川事件”的无辜被告正在继续展开支援运动。全日本造船工会中央委员会在今年二月通过决议，要发动一个要求释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告的运动。日本国民救援会也正在号召日本人民广泛地写信给负责处理“松川事件”的仙台高等裁判所裁判长铃木，要求他迅速地释放全体无辜被告。
     【新华社十日讯】东京消息：释放日本战犯的活动，正在日本吉田政府和美国政府狼狈勾结的情况下继续进行。
    吉田政府早就在为开释甲级战犯而积极活动。四月初，吉田政府正式向美、英、法等八国政府提出建议，要求首先释放三名甲级战犯——前陆军大将南次郎、荒木贞夫和畑俊六。共同社透露，对于其他甲级战犯，吉田政府也准备陆续建议予以释放。
    美国政府提前释放乙级、丙级日本战犯的工作也在继续进行。六日，美国政府又通知日本政府，批准“假释”五名日本战犯。自旧金山和约生效以来，美国已先后“假释”日本战犯五十三人。
