    Gao Fengqin Model Worker Family Group
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Women Workers Department
    The Gao Fengqin Group is a first-class model worker family group of the 724 Factory and a model worker family group of Shenyang City. The characteristics of the Gao Fengqin Group are: frequent concern for production, encouraging workers to improve their production enthusiasm, and unity and mutual assistance in daily life. The Gao Fengqin Group has also established a regular meeting system, frequently conducting criticism and self-criticism. The 724 Factory has promoted the experience of the Gao Fengqin Group, and the families of the factory's employees have organized ninety-nine mutual aid groups and ninety-eight nurseries, which have played a significant role in encouraging workers to improve their production enthusiasm; in the hygiene campaign, thanks to the efforts of the families of the employees, the 724 Factory dormitory was rated as the first hygiene model residential area in Shenyang City.
    More than two years ago, when the Gao Fengqin Group was just established, the factory's whistle blew for work every day, but most of the family members were not yet up. After eating, they would take their children to visit and gossip. Quarrels and fights often occurred, affecting the workers' production and unity. For example, the family of Lao Huang and the family of Lao Tian had a fight during the day, and at night, they told their husbands that the other party had bullied them, causing Lao Huang and Lao Tian to fight the next day and not go to work.
    Organizing Learning, Establishing Nurseries
    Gao Fengqin is the leader of this group and faced many difficulties at the time. The people in the group were half-hearted and could not be gathered for meetings. She once thought: forget it, let it go! But when she remembered what the Party branch secretary in the countryside said, "Women must liberate themselves," she mustered up her courage again.
    Soon, the trade union called on the families of employees to study culture and current events. Gao Fengqin felt this was right: with culture and understanding of new principles, things would be easier. So, she went from house to house, day and night, telling everyone the benefits of learning. She also went to the home of Han Guixin, a family member with a higher level of education, and encouraged her to come out and teach the family members. Since there was no place to teach, she vacated one of her rooms.
    The family members came to study, but there were many concerns and difficulties. For example, Yu Guoying was older and always thought she was stupid and could not learn well. Gao Fengqin would help her with needlework when she had time, so she could take time to review her lessons. Yu Changying could not write well and was not enthusiastic about learning, so Gao Fengqin mobilized Han Guixin to help her. But the biggest problem was the children. When the family members studied, the children cried and made noise. If the children were taken out, there was no one to take care of them. The family members felt that they could only study well if the children's problem was solved.
    Gao Fengqin was determined to overcome this difficulty. Once during a study session, the family members brought more than twenty children. Gao Fengqin sacrificed her own study time and took the children whose mothers were willing to entrust to her to a room, cooked porridge for them, washed their hands and faces, and washed their diapers, and had the older children lead the younger children to play. This went on for two months, and the family members were very touched, saying: we can't let the group leader take care of them all the time, let's take care of them in turn! Yu Guoying proposed to vacate her house for the children to play in. At this time, Gao Fengqin led everyone to discuss the establishment of a temporary nursery—to take care of the children when everyone was meeting, studying, and doing collective labor. And a shift system was established: during study and meetings, the family members of the whole group would take turns to be responsible, and afterwards, the study group leader or the group leader would make up the lessons and convey the content of the meeting to those on duty; during collective labor, pregnant women and those who were weak or had many children would be on duty. The nursery director was also elected to manage the care of the children and the rotation of duty. The temporary nursery was thus established.
    After the nursery was established, the group's newspaper reading and cultural learning persisted for two years. Now, most of the people in the Gao Fengqin Group can recognize more than a thousand characters, the least can recognize five hundred characters, and the most can recognize three thousand characters.
    Formulating Patriotic Pacts, Establishing a Meeting System
    In 1951, the trade union called on family members to greet the "March 8th" Women's Day with practical actions to improve housework, hygiene, and ensure that employees go to work on time. Gao Fengqin mobilized all the family members of the group to incorporate the requirements of the trade union into the patriotic pact and challenged other groups. But afterwards, everyone did not implement it well, and some even forgot the pact. Gao Fengqin felt that only by constantly supervising each other could it be implemented well, so she proposed a method of holding regular meetings to check the group. At the meeting, Gao Fengqin inspired everyone to talk about what things they had done that they had not done before after signing the patriotic pact. Some people said:
    "My husband can eat hot meals every morning." Some said: "In the past, I didn't wipe the floor for two or three months, but now I wipe it once a week." Family members who had nothing to say would hurry to do it after returning home, which promoted the implementation of the patriotic pact. At the meeting, everyone also talked about the difficulties in implementing the patriotic pact. For example, Lao Wang's family had many children and was busy, so the hygiene work was not done well. Zhao's wife said she couldn't wake up in the morning, which delayed making meals. After the meeting, Gao Fengqin mobilized Guan Xiuying and others to help Lao Wang's family clean up and went to Zhao's wife's house to knock on the door every morning. In this way, the family members felt that the meeting was helpful to them, became interested in the meeting, and the meeting was lively. Later, everyone also carried out criticism and self-criticism at the meeting. Initially, some people blushed and felt uncomfortable after being criticized, so Gao Fengqin helped her to clear her mind after the meeting. Gradually, everyone got used to it.
    After the group meeting was established, the patriotic pact was implemented well. The most significant achievement was the reduction of workers' illnesses and the guarantee of workers' attendance rate. In 1950, seventeen workers in the group took sick leave, totaling more than a month of work stoppage; in 1951, four people took leave, only stopping work for five and a half days; in 1952, not even one person took sick leave.
    Frequently Educating Family Members to Care about Production
    Gao Fengqin often educated family members to encourage workers to do a good job in production, and she took the lead in this regard. In the past, Gao Fengqin's husband, Wang Zhenyi, had a bit of a "middle-of-the-road" mentality: he was unwilling to fall behind; he was afraid of being scolded by backward elements if he made progress; when setting production targets, he did not dare to set them high. Gao Fengqin criticized him, saying, "If you are afraid of being scolded for revolution, we would not have the good days we have today!" Wang Zhenyi was inspired, became active, increased production by more than 50%, and led the whole group to increase production, becoming an advanced group.
    Gao Fengqin is very concerned about production. When she hears that a worker's production enthusiasm is not high, she will think of ways to encourage him. The worker Xu Wenlin has some skills, but he doesn't use them; he completes the quota quickly, but never exceeds it, and often arrives late and leaves early due to family matters. His wife, Ding Xizhen, was relatively backward at first. Gao Fengqin thought: to improve Xu Wenlin's production enthusiasm, we must help Ding Xizhen make progress. Ding Xizhen didn't know how to do needlework, so Gao Fengqin went to help her. Ding Xizhen's eyes would turn red every time she talked about being abused by her mother-in-law in the past. Gao Fengqin seized on this point to educate her, telling her: "In the old society, women suffered in silence; today, we are liberated, with the Communist Party supporting us, women unite, and all problems can be solved." She finally touched and inspired Ding Xizhen. Ding Xizhen reviewed her past mistakes at the group meeting and proposed that she would ensure that she would do a good job in housework in the future, reduce Xu Wenlin's family burden, and actively participate in various activities of the group. In order to help Xu Wenlin, the people in the group often went to his home to help; the group's family members and workers also cheered for Xu Wenlin when they held a joint party. When the factory launched a movement to find tricks, Gao Fengqin mobilized all the family members to encourage Xu Wenlin to find tricks. Every day when Xu Wenlin came back, the family members would ask him when they met him: "Brother Xu, have you found any tricks?" Xu Wenlin's thoughts on finding tricks gradually became active, but he was afraid of not finding them well and being laughed at by others. Ding Xizhen and Gao Fengqin told his concerns to the workshop director and the trade union chairman. After several times of help, Xu Wenlin finally eliminated his concerns and found a great trick for high-speed cutting, which increased the productivity by 75%.
    Unity and Mutual Assistance, Guaranteeing that Workers Do Not Miss Work Due to Family Matters
    In the past, when family members gave birth, workers had to stay at home to serve for a day or two; when family members were sick, workers had to take them to see a doctor. In order to improve the attendance rate of workers, the trade union called on family members to organize mutual assistance, jointly do a good job in housework, and not delay workers' production. Gao Fengqin actively responded and took the lead in mutual assistance with activists. Coincidentally, Tian's wife gave birth, and everyone went to ask a doctor, boil water, and cook. When Tian Yuluan came back, he saw that his wife and children were very well, the food in the pot was steaming, and the clothes were washed clean. He didn't have to worry about anything and was very happy; when he returned to the factory, he promoted the idea, telling the workers to do a good job in production and not to worry about their families. After Tian's wife was a month old, she also promoted the benefits of mutual assistance at the group meeting, driving all the family members of the group to participate in the mutual aid group. After Tong Wenkui's wife died, she left behind three children. The mutual aid group took care of him for several months, which did not affect his production. In the eight months after the organization of mutual assistance, the family members of the whole group gave birth to thirteen children, all of whom were taken care of by the mutual aid group, which did not affect the workers' attendance. The workers were no longer distracted by housework, so in 1951 and 1952, 85% of the workers in the whole group received production awards.
    This kind of mutual assistance later developed into mutual assistance in daily life. For example, Gao Fengqin often held meetings or went to other places to introduce experience, and the duty officers and neighbors of the group would automatically help with cooking, washing, and other things at home. When Wang Zhen'e went back to her parents' home, seeing that the weather was getting cold, the group helped to make cotton clothes. Many family members in the group wanted to buy potatoes and white sugar, so they sent people to buy them together and share them; the nursery needed to buy vegetables, so everyone collectively grew vegetables, and the vegetables were sold as a group welfare fund. In this way, mutual assistance not only guaranteed that workers would not miss work due to family matters, but also solved difficulties in life through mutual assistance.

    高凤琴模范职工家属小组
    中华全国总工会女工部
    高凤琴小组是七二四厂的一等模范职工家属小组，又是沈阳市模范职工家属小组。高凤琴小组的特点是：经常关心生产，鼓励工人提高生产积极性，在日常生活中团结互助。高凤琴小组并建立了定期会议制度，经常进行批评和自我批评。七二四工厂推广了高凤琴小组的经验，全厂职工家属组织了九十九个互助组，九十八个托儿站，在鼓励工人提高生产情绪方面起了很大作用；在卫生运动中，由于职工家属的努力，七二四厂宿舍被评为沈阳市第一名卫生模范住宅区。
    两年多以前，高凤琴小组刚刚建立起来的时候，每天厂里上班的汽笛响过多时，家属们多半还没有起床，吃过饭，又都抱着孩子去串门，扯闲话。吵嘴打架的事情时常发生，工人的生产和团结受到影响。比如老黄的家属和老田的家属白天吵过架，晚上就对丈夫说对方欺侮自己，弄得老黄和老田第二天打起来，没去上班。
    组织学习，建立托儿站
    高凤琴是这个组的小组长，当时工作中有很多困难。组里的人三心二意，开会也召集不起来。她曾想到：算了，随它去吧！但一记起在农村时党支部书记说的话：“妇女要自己来解放自己”，就又鼓起了勇气。
    不久，工会号召职工家属学文化，学时事。高凤琴觉得很对：有了文化，懂得新道理，事情就好办了。于是她白天黑夜，一家串一家，向大家讲学习的好处。又到文化程度较高的家属韩桂薪家里，鼓励她出来给家属上课。没有上课的地方，她把自己的房子腾出来一间。
    家属们来学习了，但有很多顾虑和困难。比如于桂英年纪较大，老认为自己笨，学不好。高凤琴有空就去帮助她做针线活，让她抽出时间复习功课。于长英写字写不好，学习情绪不高，高凤琴动员韩桂薪帮助她。但最困难的是孩子的问题。家属们学习时，孩子又哭又闹。把孩子抱出去，又没人管。家属们觉得，只有解决了孩子问题，才能学习好。
    高凤琴下决心克服这个困难。有一次学习时，家属们带来了二十多个孩子。高凤琴牺牲自己的学习，把母亲们愿意交给她看的孩子领到一间屋里去，熬粥给孩子们吃，给他们洗手、洗脸、洗刷尿垫子，叫大孩子领着小孩子玩。这样一连两个月，家属们十分感动，说：那能让组长一个人老带着，咱们轮流照顾吧！于桂英提出把自己的房子腾出来给孩子们玩。这时，高凤琴又领导大家讨论建立临时托儿站——在大家开会、学习和集体劳动时，收托孩子。并订出值班办法：学习和开会时由全组家属轮流负责，事后由学习小组长或小组长给值班的补课和传达会议内容；集体劳动时，由孕妇和身体弱的或孩子多的家属值班。又选出托儿站站长管理收托孩子和轮流值班的事情。临时托儿站就这样建立起来了。
    托儿站建立后，小组的读报和文化学习一直坚持了两年。现在高凤琴小组的人，大部分能认识一千多字，最少的认五百字，最多的认识了三千字。
    订立爱国公约，建立会议制度
    一九五一年，工会号召家属用搞好家务，搞好卫生，保证职工按时上班的实际行动迎接“三八”妇女节。高凤琴发动全组家属把工会的要求订入爱国公约，并和其它小组挑战。可是过后大家却没有执行好，有人甚至把公约也忘了。高凤琴觉得只有经常互相督促，才能执行得好，便提出小组定期开会检查的办法。开会时，高凤琴启发大家谈订了爱国公约以后做了那些以前没有做到的事情。有的人说：
    “丈夫天天早上能吃上热饭了。”有的说：“过去两三个月不擦地板，现在每个星期都擦一回。”没有什么可说的家属，回去以后就赶紧做，这样就督促了爱国公约的执行。在会上，大家也谈到执行爱国公约中的困难。譬如老王家孩子多、忙，卫生工作作不好。赵大嫂说早上醒不了，耽误了作饭。会后高凤琴就发动关秀英等帮助老王家扫除，每天早上到赵大嫂家去叫门。这样家属们觉得开会对自己有帮助，对开会有了兴趣，会开得也热闹了。以后，大家又在会上开展批评和自我批评。最初，有人受到批评后，脸红耳热，受不了，高凤琴就在会后帮助她打通思想。慢慢地，大家也就习惯了。
    小组会议建立后，爱国公约执行得好了，最显著的成绩是减少了工人的疾病，保证了工人的出勤率。一九五○年全组工人中有十七名请病假的，共歇工一个多月；一九五一年有四个人请假，只歇工五天半；一九五二年连一个请病假的都没有。
    经常教育家属关心生产
    高凤琴常常教育家属鼓励工人搞好生产，自己在这方面更起带头作用。过去，高凤琴的丈夫王振一思想有点“中间幌”：落后，自己不愿意；进步，又怕落后分子骂；订产量计划时，他不敢订高。高凤琴就批评他说：“革命怕挨骂，咱们就没有今天的好日子！”王振一受到启发，积极起来，产量提高百分之五十以上，并带动全组提高产量，成为先进小组。
    高凤琴非常关心生产。她听说那个工友生产情绪不高，她就要想办法鼓励他。工人徐文林很有些技术，就是不拿出来；定额完成得快，但从来不超额，并且常为了家事迟到、早退。他老婆丁喜珍，原先比较落后。高凤琴想：要提高徐文林的生产情绪，就要帮助丁喜珍进步。丁喜珍不会做针线活，高凤琴去帮助她做。丁喜珍每谈起过去受婆婆虐待的事，眼圈就发红。高凤琴便抓住这点教育她，跟她说：“在旧社会，妇女受气是哑叭吃黄连，苦在心里；今天解放了，有共产党撑腰，妇女团结起来，什么问题都好解决。”终于感动和启发了丁喜珍。丁喜珍在小组会上检讨了自己过去的错误，并提出以后保证搞好家务，减少徐文林的家事负担，积极参加小组的各种活动。小组的人为了帮助徐文林，也常常去他家帮忙；小组家属和工人开联欢晚会时，也给徐文林打气。厂里开展找窍门运动了，高凤琴动员了全组家属鼓励徐文林找窍门。徐文林每天回来，家属们碰见他就问：“徐大哥找到窍门了没有？”徐文林找窍门的思想，渐渐活动起来，但怕找不好，别人笑话。丁喜珍、高凤琴把他的心事告诉了车间主任和工会主席。经过几次帮助，徐文林终于消除了顾虑，找到了高速切削的大窍门，使生产率提高了百分之七十五。
    团结互助，保证工人不因家事缺勤
    过去，家属生孩子，工人得在家侍候一两天；家属生病，也得要工人领着去看病。工会为了提高工人出勤率，号召家属组织互助，共同搞好家务，不耽误工人生产。高凤琴积极响应，首先和积极分子带头互助。正好田大嫂生孩子，大家便分头去请大夫，烧水，做饭。田玉栾回来，看见老婆、孩子都很好，锅里饭菜热气腾腾，衣服也洗得干干净净，什么都不要自己操心，高兴极了；回到厂里就宣传，叫工人们好好生产，不要惦念家里。田大嫂满月后，也在小组会上宣传互助的好处，带动全组家属都参加了互助组。佟文魁的妻子死后留下三个孩子，互助组一连给他照顾了好几个月，没有影响他生产。在组织互助后的八个月中，全组家属生了十三个孩子，都是由互助组照顾的，没有影响工人出勤。工人们在家务事上不分心了，因此，在一九五
    一年和一九五二年，全组工人百分之八十五都得了生产奖励。
    这种互助，以后更发展为日常生活中的互助。比如高凤琴经常开会，或到别的地方介绍经验，家里做饭、刷洗等事，小组的值日和邻居们就自动地帮着做了。王振娥回娘家去，瞧着天气要冷了，小组就帮助把棉衣做好。组里许多家属要买土豆、白糖，就派人去一起买来大家分；托儿站需要买青菜，大家就集体种菜，菜卖了作小组福利基金。这样，互助不仅保证了工人不因家事缺勤，而且经过互助解决了生活上的困难。
