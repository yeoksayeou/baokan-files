Shandong and Shaanxi Trial Grassroots Elections
[This newspaper dispatch] The grassroots election work in Licheng County, Shandong Province—a key experimental county for grassroots election work—began on May 10th. The first phase involves thirty-three townships (three districts). The county has ten districts and a total of one hundred and fourteen townships, and it has been decided to carry out the work in three phases, which is expected to be completed by the end of August. Licheng County requires the following four points throughout the entire general election process: (1) The entire general election work must be subordinate to production tasks and completed on schedule on the premise that production is the overriding central task; (2) fully mobilize the masses; (3) leading cadres should put in more effort, make full preparations, be regular and simple, and strive to reduce the activity time of the masses; (4) the vast majority of voters actively participate in the election.

In order to ensure that the grassroots election work is carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner and is closely integrated with current production and party rectification work, the entire work process is divided into four steps: First, after the general election work team arrives in the township, it first helps the township summarize the production work of the previous stage and arranges the production tasks for the next stage, and conducts evaluations; at the same time, it conducts extensive democratic education and publicizes the important significance of the general election work. Secondly, with the dispatched general election work cadres as the backbone, a township election work team is formed to initially understand the population and other conditions; in the course of universally carrying out education on the people's democratic dictatorship, the masses are made to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and the masses are mobilized to actively participate in the general election work. Second, in conjunction with production activities, the issue of voter qualifications is deliberated. On the basis of mature deliberation and sufficient preparation by the leaders, a formal population survey and voter registration work are carried out. When carrying out voter registration, the review of voter qualifications is combined. The people who should be subject to control and those who have been deprived of their civil rights according to law shall be democratically discussed and determined by the masses, and announced to the public, and then identified by the masses. If those who are controlled or deprived of their civil rights are not satisfied, they can appeal to the People's Court, which shall make a final ruling. Third, deliberate and nominate candidates and elect representatives. During this stage, it is necessary to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, mobilize the masses, educate cadres, remove those who are considered bad, and elect those who are loved by the masses. Fourth, prepare for the convening of the township people's congress.

In terms of cadre allocation, it is necessary to ensure that there are backbones in each phase. In addition to the production mutual aid work team, the party rectification work team, the political and legal committee of the State Council's construction work group, and the district cadres of these three districts, a total of one hundred and fifty-two people, twenty-eight district cadres will be transferred from the seven districts that have not yet conducted general elections after training and internship and used as the backbone of the second phase of the general election. When carrying out the second phase of the general election, in addition to the district and township cadres participating in the first phase of the general election and the cadres in the districts where the general election is underway, a total of sixty-nine people, thirty-four district cadres and county-level机关cadres who are about to conduct general elections will be transferred as the backbone of the next phase of the general election. For the allocation of technical personnel for surveying the population and registering voters, one person is assigned to each township in areas with a high level of people's culture, and three to five people are assigned to each township in mountainous areas. These people also participate in publicity work at the beginning of the general election. Therefore, in addition to requiring them to learn how to write forms, they must also understand the meaning of the general election. (Zhang Rongan)

[This newspaper dispatch] According to the "Masses Daily" news: In order to gain experience in grassroots elections, the Shaanxi Provincial Election Committee decided to conduct a trial grassroots election in seven townships in the second district of Lintong County. The trial cadres went to the countryside on the 5th. A total of eighty-three cadres participated in the trial. Most of the cadres have been concentrating on studying documents for one and a half months since the beginning of March. They studied the election law and related election documents and instructions, and also studied documents related to the development of this movement, such as the documents on launching a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. In order to make this trial achieve the purpose of creating experience, training cadres, setting examples, and guiding the grassroots election work in the province, in addition to the cadres drawn from provincial-level 机关and Lintong County, five directly affiliated counties and cities in Shaanxi Province, the Weinan Special District 机关, and the seventeen counties (excluding Lintong) under the Weinan Special District, will also draw a certain number of cadres to participate in this trial.

The Shaanxi Provincial Election Committee attaches great importance to this trial. It has made specific plans in advance and stipulated specific steps and methods. When the cadres who tried the grassroots elections went down, Shi Yizhi, director of the Provincial Election Committee Office, made a mobilization report. In order to guide the trial more specifically, Director Shi Yizhi went to the trial area before the trial to understand and check the preparation work.

The trial area includes three townships in the plains, three townships in the mountains, and one city that can represent general streets and towns. The trial experience in these areas will be instructive for the general election movement in most parts of Shaanxi Province in the future.

At present, most of the cadres participating in the trial have arrived in the trial townships in batches to conduct propaganda and understand the situation. After the 10th, under the unified leadership of the County Election Committee, the trial work will officially begin.

    山东陕西试办基层选举
    【本报讯】山东省基层选举工作重点试验县——历城县的基层选举工作已于五月十日开始。第一期为三十三个乡（三个区）。全县十个区，共一百十四个乡，决定分三期进行，预计在八月底可全部完成。历城县在整个普选工作过程中，要求作到下列四点：（一）整个普选工作要服从生产任务，在以生产为压倒一切的中心工作的前提下，按期完成；
    （二）充分发动群众；（三）领导干部多下工夫，充分作好准备，作到正规简便，力求减少群众活动时间；（四）最大多数选民积极参加选举。
    为了保证基层选举工作有领导有步骤地进行，并密切结合当前生产、整党等工作，全部工作过程分四个步骤：第一、普选工作队到乡后，首先帮助所在乡总结前一阶段的生产工作，布置下一阶段的生产任务，展开评比；同时广泛进行民主教育，宣传普选工作的重要意义。其次是以派去的普选工作干部为骨干，组成乡选工作队，初步了解人口等情况；在普遍进行人民民主专政的教育中，使群众划清敌我界限，发动群众积极参加普选工作。第二、结合生产活动，对选民资格问题进行酝酿，在酝酿比较成熟，领导已有充分准备的基础上，正式进行人口调查和选民登记工作。进行选民登记时，结合进行选民资格的审查。对依法应受管制和被剥夺公民权的人，由群众民主讨论确定，出榜公布，再由群众讨论甄别。被管制或被剥夺公民权者如不服，可向人民法庭上诉，由人民法庭最后裁决。第三、酝酿提候选人、选举代表。在这一阶段内，要结合开展反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，发动群众，教育干部，去掉那些自己认为不好的人，选出群众所爱戴的人。第四、筹备召开乡人民代表大会。
    在干部配备上，要保证各期都有骨干。第一期普选工作干部除生产互助工作队、整党工作队、政务院政法委员会建政工作组以及这三个区的区干部共一百五十二人外，再从现在尚未进行普选的七个区抽调二十八个区干部，经过训练和实习后，作为第二期普选的骨干。进行第二期普选时，除抽调参加第一期普选的区乡干部及正在进行普选区的干部共六十九人外，再抽调即将进行普选的区干部和县级机关干部三十四人，作为下期普选的骨干。对于调查人口与登记选民的技术人员的配备，在人民文化水平较高的地区，每乡配备一人，山区每乡配备三人至五人。这些人在普选开始时也要参加宣传工作。因此除要求他们学会写表册外，还要懂得普选的意义。            　（张荣安）
    【本报讯】据群众日报消息：为了取得基层选举的经验，陕西省选举委员会决定在临潼县二区七个乡进行试办基层选举，试办干部已于五日下乡。参加试办的干部共八十三人，大部分干部从三月上旬起即集中进行了一个半月的文件学习。他们学习了选举法和有关选举的文件、指示，还学习了与开展这一运动有关的文件，如关于开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争的文件，中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等。为了使这次试办达到创造经验、培养干部、树立榜样、指导全省基层选举工作的目的，除了省级机关和临潼县抽调的干部外，陕西省五个直属县、市，渭南专区机关及渭南专区所属的十七个县（临潼在外），也都将抽出一定数量的干部参加这次试办。
    陕西省选举委员会对这次试办是很重视的，事前即作出了具体计划，规定了具体的步骤方法。在试办基层选举的干部下去时，省选举委员会办公室主任时逸之作了动员报告。为了更具体地指导试办，时逸之主任又于试办前前往试办地区了解、检查准备工作进行情况。
    这次试办的地区，共有平原三个乡、山区三个乡和能代表一般街镇的一个市。这些地区的试办经验，对于将来陕西全省大部地区的普选运动都是有指导作用的。
    目前，参加试办工作的大部分干部，已经分期到达各试办乡，进行宣传和了解情况，十日以后在县选举委员会的统一领导下，正式开始试办工作。
