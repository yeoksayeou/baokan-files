    The Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble
    By Mi Dunbalufuski, Deputy Director of the Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble and Director of the Art Education Department of the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art
    The beautiful life of our people began on the day of liberation. The heroic Soviet army and Polish soldiers fought side by side, subdued the Hitler demon, and brought us freedom and a new regime. Thus, a beautiful vision of a socialist future unfolded before our people in all areas of life. After the great social and economic revolution was realized, the cultural revolution was able to begin and proceed.
    The Party and the government raised the issue of creating a new culture and a new art for cultural workers, one that would reflect the lives of new people, all their emotions, and their struggle to realize the socialist system. Trade unions, cultural workers' associations, and all mass organizations mobilized to participate in this struggle, and all art schools were reformed. In the former capitalist system, culture was inaccessible and incomprehensible to the common people. Now, the question of how to make culture accessible to people and how to make the masses interested in culture has been given top priority. Our Party and government are very concerned about and help the development of artistic life, creation, art schools, and amateur art groups. Our life has changed not only economically, but also in the nature of artistic life. New culture and new art open their doors to workers and peasants. In our country, art has become a force to inspire and promote the masses to achieve great achievements in construction, and we have discovered a great treasure trove of folk art that was previously undeveloped among the broad masses of the people. The artistic talent of the people has gained the conditions for development. The establishment of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble is a clear example of this. The Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble is the first national folk song and dance troupe in Poland, and it has an important task, which is to bring folk songs to workers, peasants, and the working people of the whole country, and to preserve the unique folk nature of songs and dances. The second task of the song and dance troupe is to collect the most valuable tunes from folk songs together with composers.
    The Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble is a typical folk song and dance troupe. It performs songs and dances and strives to preserve the unique folk forms of songs and dances. All the song and dance programs currently performed by the song and dance troupe are extracted from the folk songs of Gurbivsk and Opoczensk, that is, collected from Mazowieckie, the birthplace of the great Polish composer Chopin.
    One of the oldest songs sung by the song and dance troupe, "Hired Farmhand," has been preserved from the tragic era of serfdom. All the pain and grievances of the poor hired farmhands and all serfs are expressed in this simple and unadorned art form. The content of "Little Duck" is modern - the lyrics are folk. But although it has been modified, it is still an ancient song.
    The dances of the song and dance troupe are also based on the life of the people, and the form of performance is also folk. For example, the Gurbivsk dances "Olenje", "Zurav", "Povornec" and "Polka Tramblyanka" were all taught by the peasants.
    The costumes of the song and dance troupe are also collected from the countryside, but they are slightly embellished when performed on stage. The Opoczensk costumes are particularly beautiful and colorful. (The Opoczensk costumes are very similar to the Rowicz costumes, the only difference is that the floral stripes on the Opoczensk costumes are slightly narrower than those on the Rowicz costumes.)
    In addition to performing folk songs, the song and dance troupe also performs mass songs with modern content, that is, songs praising leaders, labor heroes, and youth songs. At present, the song and dance troupe sings Chinese folk songs praising Mao Zedong, songs praising Stalin, and Polish songs praising Beirut, as well as other songs.
    The young actors of the song and dance troupe have made great contributions in creation. They bring folk songs and dances from their own villages to the song and dance troupe. These materials are artistically processed by composers, dancers and chorus instructors, and then performed on the stage, but all these songs and dances retain their folk characteristics.
    The members of the song and dance troupe often write lyrics for mass songs. For example, the lyrics of "Song of Beirut" were written by Sabina Dauposh.
    This working method was created by the founders of the song and dance troupe, namely: one of Poland's great composers, Segtinski - whose artistic processing of the song and dance troupe's programs - and dance instructor Yevgeny Bapalinski.
    In the future, the song and dance troupe will continue to preserve the true folk form, and most of the mass songs will also be based on folk songs. Not long ago, Andrzej Panufnik, the most outstanding Polish composer who has shown great talent in Polish folk music work, was appointed as the artistic leader of the song and dance troupe.
    The folk songs and dances performed by the song and dance troupe are the source of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble's success. The song and dance troupe has been performing since 1951, and since then, it has performed more than 100 times in Poland and abroad. The song and dance troupe has visited the Soviet Union twice, and has also performed in the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.
    In 1951, the song and dance troupe was awarded the Polish First Class National Prize for its work achievements, and in January 1953, it won the Polish Second Class Labor Flag. During its visit to the Soviet Union, the song and dance troupe received the highest honor, the opportunity to perform in front of Comrade Stalin, and also received a large bonus.
    Under the care of the Party led by Comrade Beirut, the beloved leader of our people, all members of the song and dance troupe have the opportunity to realize their ideals, develop their talents, and receive general education. All members receive professional and general secondary education. The members of the song and dance troupe study for three years, and after passing the examination and obtaining a certificate of honor, they either stay in the song and dance troupe to work, or go to serve as folk song and dance instructors in cultural palaces. The most talented members will be sent to continue their studies. By the end of this year, sixty members will receive diplomas from professional schools, and thirty of them will complete secondary school courses.
    Until now, all the members have been studying and working at the same time - performing in Poland and abroad. The song and dance troupe's visit to the People's Republic of China is a new and glorious page in its history, and it is also a great achievement of friendship and cultural cooperation between our two peoples.

    波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团
    波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团副团长  波兰文化艺术部艺术教育司司长  米·顿巴鲁夫斯基
    我国人民的美好生活是从解放那天开始的。英雄的苏联军队和波兰士兵并肩作战，制服了希特勒恶魔，给我们带来了自由和新的政权。于是，在我国人民的面前，在生活的一切领域里展开了美好的社会主义未来的远景。伟大的社会和经济的革命实现以后，文化革命就得以开始和进行了。
    党和政府在文化工作者的面前提出了创立新的文化和新的艺术的问题，这种新的文化和艺术要反映出新人物的生活、他们的全部感情以及他们为争取社会主义制度的实现而进行的斗争。工会、文化工作者协会和一切群众团体都动员起来参加了这个斗争，所有的艺术学校都进行了改革。在从前资本主义制度时代，文化是普通人民所不能接受和理解的。而现在，如何使文化能被人们所接受以及如何使群众对文化都感到兴趣这一问题，已经被提到首要地位了。我们的党和政府对于艺术生活、创作、艺术学校和业余艺术小组都很关心，并帮助其发展。我们的生活不仅在经济方面起了变化，而且在艺术生活的性质上也发生了变化。新的文化和新的艺术对工人、农民敞开自己的大门。在我国，艺术已成为激发与推动群众在建设事业中获取巨大成就的力量了，我们在广大的人民群众中间发掘了伟大的从前未被开发的民间艺术的宝藏。人民的艺术天才获得了发展的条件。玛佐夫舍歌舞团的创立，就是这方面的一个明显的例证。玛佐夫舍歌舞团是波兰第一个国立的民间歌舞团，它负有重大的任务，就是要把民间歌曲带到工人、农民和全国劳动人民中去，并且要保存歌舞的独特的民间性质。歌舞团的第二个任务，是和作曲家共同从民歌中采集最宝贵的曲调。
    玛佐夫舍歌舞团是一个典型的民间歌舞团，它演出歌舞，并努力保存歌舞的独特的民间形式。歌舞团现在所演出的全部歌舞节目，是从古尔比夫斯克和奥波琴斯克民间歌曲提炼出来的，也就是从波兰伟大的作曲家萧邦的出生地——玛佐维茨克地方收集来的。
    歌舞团所演唱的一支最古老的歌曲“雇农”，还是从悲惨的农奴制时代保存下来的。贫苦的雇农和所有农奴的一切痛苦和诉怨，都在这个简单朴素的艺术形式中表现出来了。“小鸭子”的内容是现代的——歌词是民间的。但它虽然经过了一些修改，也仍然是一支古老的歌曲。
    歌舞团的舞蹈，也是以人民生活作为创作基础的，演出的形式也是民间的。例如，“奥连捷尔”、“茹拉夫”、“波伏尔涅克”和“波尔卡特兰勃良卡”这几个古尔比夫斯克的舞蹈，就都是请农民们传授的。
    歌舞团的服装，也是从农村里搜集来的，不过在舞台上演出时略加修饰而已。奥波琴斯克的服装特别美丽而多彩。（奥波琴斯克的服装与罗维茨克的服装非常相似，不同的地方只是奥波琴斯克服装上的花条比罗维茨克的稍窄一些。）
    歌舞团除了演出民间歌曲外，还演出具有现代内容的群众歌曲，即歌颂领袖、歌颂劳动英雄的歌曲和青年歌曲。现时，歌舞团演唱着歌颂毛泽东的中国民歌、歌颂斯大林的歌曲以及歌颂贝鲁特的波兰歌曲和其他歌曲。
    歌舞团的青年演员在创作上有着巨大的贡献。他们从自己的乡村里把民间歌舞带到歌舞团来。这些素材经作曲家、舞蹈家和合唱指导在艺术上加工后，再在舞台上演出，但所有这些歌舞都保存着它们的民间的特点。
    歌舞团的团员们经常写作群众歌曲的歌词。例如，“贝鲁特之歌”的歌词就是萨比娜·道波诗所作的。
    这种工作方式是歌舞团的创始人们所创立的，他们就是：波兰的伟大作曲家之一塞格廷斯基——歌舞团的节目经过他的艺术加工——和舞蹈指导叶夫格尼·巴帕林斯基。
    歌舞团将来还要保存真正的民间形式，群众歌曲大部分也将以民间歌曲为创作基础。不久以前，歌舞团已由在波兰民间音乐工作中表现出极大才能的波兰最杰出的作曲家安得烈·潘努夫尼克担任艺术领导。
    歌舞团演出的民间歌舞，是玛佐夫舍歌舞团获得成功的泉源。歌舞团从一九五一年开始演出，从那时起到现在，它在波兰和国外一共演出了一百多次。歌舞团曾访问过苏联两次，还曾去德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克演出过。
    一九五一年，歌舞团由于自己的工作成绩，荣膺了波兰一等国家奖金，一九五三年一月，获得了波兰二等劳动奖旗。在访问苏联时，歌舞团获得了最高的荣誉，得有机会在斯大林同志面前演出，并且还得到了很大的奖金。
    在我国人民亲爱的领袖贝鲁特同志所领导的党的关怀下，歌舞团的全体团员都获得了实现自己的理想、发展自己的天才和受到普通教育的机会。全体团员都受到专业的和普通的中等教育。歌舞团的团员要学习三年，经考试后取得荣誉证书之后，他们或者留在歌舞团工作，或者去担任文化宫的民间歌舞教员。最有才能的团员将被派去继续学习。今年年底，将有六十个团员得到专业学校的毕业证书，其中有三十个团员将读完中学的课程。
    直到现在为止，全体团员都是在一面学习，一面工作着——在波兰和在国外演出。歌舞团这次到中华人民共和国来访问演出，乃是它历史上新的光荣的一页，也是我们两国人民间友好和文化合作的巨大成就。
