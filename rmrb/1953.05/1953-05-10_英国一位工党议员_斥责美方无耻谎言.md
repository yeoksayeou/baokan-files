Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th - A British Labour Member of the House of Lords, Lord Strabolgi, condemned the American fabrication of lies about "mistreatment" of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side as a "most despicable and shameless psychological warfare."

Lord Strabolgi said in the House of Lords on May 6 that the repatriated British prisoners of war had already spoken the truth about the Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war camps, and they all admitted that they had received fairly good treatment.

Lord Strabolgi said: "The idea of a relaxation of the Cold War seems to have caused great panic to some people. I am deeply afraid that the prospect of easing the Cold War - or even better, reaching some real agreement between the major powers - has greatly alarmed those who have a vested interest in the Cold War."

He said, "You can see the signs of these panics in the news of mistreatment, which are obviously fabricated in the most despicable way from the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Bizarre news about ill-treatment has been spread, especially in American newspapers. There is a purpose behind it. It is a most despicable and shameless psychological warfare."

    英国一位工党议员
    斥责美方无耻谎言
    【新华社九日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党上议院议员斯特拉鲍尔基斥责美国方面捏造朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎言是一种“最卑鄙无耻的心理战”。
    斯特拉鲍尔基五月六日在上议院中说，被遣返的英国战俘已经说出了朝中战俘营中的真实情况，他们都承认他们所得到的待遇相当好。
    斯特拉鲍尔基说：“冷战趋于缓和的想法，看来已引起某些人士的巨大惊慌。我深怕缓和冷战——或者甚至更好一些，而使大国之间获得某些真正的协议——的前景，已经使那些在冷战中有重大利益的人大为惊慌。”
    他说，“诸位在虐待消息中就可以看出这些惊惶的征象，这些消息显然是从交换病伤战俘一事中用最卑鄙的办法编造出来的。关于待遇恶劣的离奇的消息已传布开了，特别是在美国的报纸上。它的背后有一个目的。这是一种最卑鄙无耻的心理战。”
