Farmers in Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces affected by frost disasters are actively utilizing various water sources to irrigate wheat and protect seedlings, and have now achieved remarkable results.

In the Danhe, Canghe, Guangli, Baiquan and other irrigation areas of Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, farmers have been rushing to release water to irrigate wheat since mid-April, and have now irrigated more than 200,000 mu. In the Dan Dong and other irrigation areas with the habit of watering wheat, the first round of irrigation was completed by the end of April, and the second round is now underway. Some areas that did not have the habit of watering wheat have also generally started watering after key pilot irrigations proved effective. Farmers in well-irrigated areas of Henan Province generally did not have the habit of watering wheat in the past. After this trial irrigation, farmers also generally began to use well water to irrigate wheat. In places without irrigation equipment, farmers used methods such as carrying water in wooden buckets and transporting water in horse-drawn carts to irrigate wheat and protect seedlings. About 50% to 60% of farmers in Shangqiu Prefecture participated in wheat watering activities. In order to irrigate wheat, the Ninth District of Shenqiu County recently repaired 200 old wells and dug 50 earthen wells. Xinxiang Prefecture loaned out 1,600 waterwheels, and LinYing County loaned out 400 waterwheels. In Anhui Province, Mengcheng, Fengtai, Fuyang and other counties in Fuyang Prefecture irrigated more than 35,000 mu in three days from April 25th to 27th. The masses in Shuangfu District, Taihe County, dried up five wells watering wheat, and started digging new wells. More than 900 cadres in Guoyang County led farmers to irrigate wheat. The masses were very happy and said, "Protecting the seedlings protects our lives. Watering wheat is more important than anything else." In areas with irrigation equipment in Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, typical demonstrations and organized visits were adopted to guide the masses to irrigate wheat. A total of about 120,000 mu of wheat was irrigated in the whole area in April. In Teng County Prefecture, 207,000 mu have been irrigated.

Wheat grows very well in the irrigated wheat fields. The wheat in the Dandong and Canghe irrigation areas of Henan Province that was irrigated before the frost suffered very little frost damage, and the wheat seedlings grew very luxuriantly. By the end of April, the ears had sprouted uniformly. The wheat irrigated after the frost disaster quickly recovered its vitality. More than half of the wheat seedlings have formed ears, and new seedlings have grown from most of the dead seedling roots. The wheat that was irrigated early is now seven or eight inches to one foot tall, and the ears have sprouted uniformly, with each ear bearing at least twelve grains and at most fifteen grains (normally developed wheat has more than twenty grains per ear). The wheat that was irrigated late is also budding and heading.

During the grain filling period of wheat, sufficient moisture is needed. At present, there is insufficient rainfall in Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces. Therefore, it is urgent to seize the time to widely publicize the benefits of watering wheat and lead and organize the masses to fully utilize all water sources to irrigate wheat in order to ensure that the wheat grains are full and to reduce frost damage losses. The following issues should be paid attention to when leading wheat irrigation: (1) In canal irrigation areas, because the masses generally demand wheat irrigation, the water source is already insufficient. Some irrigation areas have experienced water disputes, and some irrigation areas use water unreasonably, wasting water. Therefore, the management organizations of each canal should distinguish between priorities and urgencies, uniformly allocate water in a planned manner, and educate farmers to cherish water. It is advocated to irrigate in shifts day and night. Where it is possible to open ditches and make ridges, ditches and ridges should be used for irrigation as much as possible to save water. (2) There are still many wells and waterwheels that have not been utilized. Some are because of insufficient labor and animal power, and some are because the water lifting tools are broken or lack parts. Therefore, it is necessary to organize temporary mutual aid and exchange labor well, and mobilize blacksmiths and carpenters to repair and assemble waterwheels and other water lifting tools in each village. Supply and marketing cooperatives or agricultural material supply societies should promptly supply waterwheel parts. Existing waterwheels should be quickly transferred to the areas in need to meet the needs of farmers. (3) In areas without irrigation equipment, it is appropriate to advocate the use of various containers to carry water and transport water for sprinkling irrigation.

(4) Pay attention to the watering time. It is best not to water during the wheat flowering period, so as not to lower the ground temperature and affect wheat pollination. The wheat flowering period is generally six or seven days. Two or three days before or after the flowering period, water is very much needed. Irrigation should be carried out in a timely manner, but the amount of irrigation water should not be excessive. (5) In some areas, the masses still have some concerns about watering wheat. For example, in Genglou Township, Shenxian County, Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, some wheat fields are more than one foot deep, and water wells and waterwheels are right in front of them, but very few wheat fields are watered. The reason is that there is insufficient fertilizer and the land has not been leveled well. The masses are afraid of damaging the wheat by watering it. Therefore, local cadres should carefully study and discuss with the masses and solve the specific problems in watering wheat through specific examples to eliminate the concerns of the masses.

[Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th] Anhui Province has begun to supply a large amount of grain from the province's reserves and transported from other provinces to farmers in the disaster-stricken Huaibei area since mid-April, greatly encouraging the confidence of disaster-stricken farmers in striving to achieve this year's production plan. Farmers in Fuyang Prefecture are now launching a wave of watering to protect seedlings and planting to fight drought. Funan, Mengcheng and other six counties have watered seedlings and planted more than 570,000 mu. The 18 farmers in the Wang Mingren mutual aid group in Yangwei Township, Yingbin District, Yingshang County, have set a plan to actively water seedlings and replant, and strive to produce more than 35,400 jin of grain in the summer for the whole group.

In this grain transportation work, railway employees, automobile workers, boatmen and porters in Anhui Province have launched a rapid transportation competition in order to transport the grain to the grain-needed areas as soon as possible. In the seven days from April 20th to 26th, the water and land transportation workers in Bengbu City completed 82% of the monthly transportation plan. On various transportation lines, new records appear almost every day. The wooden sailboat people in Tianjia'an Port on the Huaihe River put forward the competition slogan of "fast forward, fast reverse, fast loading, fast unloading, fast going, and fast returning." On April 26th, they loaded and transported 4,151 tons of grain in one day, which is equivalent to the export volume of this port in the past month. The Chen Fengming wooden sailboat team, which won the title of "Glorious Model Fleet" in the great Huaihe River management and transportation work, created a new record of traveling 50 boat kilometers against the current in one day. The general wooden sailboats have also increased from 20 boat kilometers per day in the past to 30 boat kilometers per day. The automobile workers in Bengbu City have created the latest provincial record of traveling 960 li (480 km) in one day.

    农民浇麦保苗收到成效
    安徽开始大量供应粮食给淮北受灾农民
    【本报讯】河南、山东、江苏、安徽等省遭受霜灾地区的农民，积极利用各种水源，浇麦保苗，现已收到显著成效。
    河南省新乡专区丹河、沧河、广利、百泉等渠道灌区，从四月中旬起农民都赶着放水浇麦，现在已浇二十多万亩。丹东等有浇麦习惯的灌区，四月底已浇完一遍，现正浇第二遍。有些没有浇麦习惯的地区，经过重点试浇收效后，也普遍浇起来了。河南省井水灌溉地区的农民，过去一般没有浇麦习惯，这次经过试浇，农民也普遍地开始利用井水浇麦。没有灌溉设备的地方，农民就用木桶担水、马车运水等办法，浇麦保苗。商邱专区约有百分之五十至六十的农民参加了浇麦活动。为了浇麦，沈邱县第九区最近修起旧井二百眼，打土井五十眼，新乡专区贷出了水车一千六百部，临颍县贷出了水车四百部。安徽省阜阳专区蒙城、凤台、阜阳等县四月二十五日至二十七日三天中就浇了三万五千多亩。太和县双俘区群众浇麦浇干了五眼井，又开始打新井。涡阳县有九百多名干部领导农民浇麦，群众很高兴，都说：“保住苗就保住了命，浇麦比干啥都强。”山东省聊城专区有灌溉设备的地方，都采取了典型示范组织参观的方法，引导群众浇麦。全区四月份共约浇麦十二万亩。滕县专区已浇二十万七千亩。
    浇过的麦田，麦子长得很好。河南省丹东、沧河两灌区霜前浇过的小麦，霜害很轻，麦秧生长很茂盛，四月底穗已莠齐。霜灾后浇的麦子，很快恢复了生机，半数以上麦秧都结了穗子，死秧根上大部都生出新苗。浇得早的现在已高七、八寸至一尺，穗已莠齐，每穗结子少的十二粒，多的十五粒（发育正常的小麦每穗二十多粒）。浇水晚的也正在打苞抽穗。
    麦粒灌浆时期，需要充足水分，目前河南、江苏、安徽等省，雨水不足，因此急需争取时间广泛宣传浇麦的好处，领导和组织群众充分利用一切水源浇麦，以求麦粒饱满，减轻霜灾损失。领导浇麦应注意下面的问题：（一）渠道灌区，因为群众普遍要求浇麦，水源已感不足，有的灌区已经发生争水现象，有的灌区用水不合理，浪费了水量。因此，各渠道管理组织，应当分清轻重缓急，有计划地统一配水，并教育农民珍惜用水，提倡昼夜轮浇，能够开沟作畦的，尽量实行沟浇畦浇，节省水量。（二）仍有不少水井、水车没有利用起来，有的是因为劳力畜力不足，有的是因为提水工具坏了或者缺少零件，因此需要很好地组织临时性的互助换工，动员铁匠、木匠到各村轮回修配水车和其他提水工具。供销合作社或农业物资供应社应当及时地供应水车零件。现有水车应当迅速调拨到需要的地区，满足农民的需要。（三）没有灌溉设备的地区，可以适当提倡利用各种容器担水运水洒浇。
    （四）注意浇水时间。在小麦开花期间，最好不浇水，以免降低地温影响小麦授粉。小麦开花期一般是六、七天，开花以前或开花期以后两三天，都很需要水分，应适时灌溉，但灌水也不宜过量。（五）还有些地区的群众，对浇麦仍有一些顾虑。如山东省聊城专区莘县耿楼乡有的麦地干了一尺多深，水井水车就在跟前，但是浇麦的很少。原因是施肥不足，土地没有平整好，群众怕把麦子浇坏了。因此当地干部应细致地与群众研究商量，通过具体事例解决浇麦当中的具体问题，消除群众的顾虑。
    【新华社合肥二十日电】安徽省从四月中旬起已开始把本省储备的和从外省运来的大量粮食供应受灾的淮北地区的农民，大大鼓舞了受灾农民争取实现今年生产计划的信心。阜阳专区的农民，现在已掀起了浇水保苗、点种抗旱的热潮。阜南、蒙城等六县已浇苗和点种五十七万多亩。颍上县颍滨区杨圩乡王明仁互助组的十八户农民，订出积极浇苗补种，争取全组夏季产粮三万五千四百多斤的计划。
    在这次运粮工作中，安徽省的铁路员工、汽车工人、船民和搬运工人，都为了及早地把粮食运到需粮地区开展了快速运输竞赛。在四月二十日到二十六日的七天中，蚌埠市的水陆运输工人，就完成全月运输计划的百分之八十二。在各个交通线上，几乎每天都有新纪录出现。淮河田家庵港口的木帆船民，提出“快进档，快退档，快装、快卸、快走、快回”的竞赛口号，四月二十六日一天就装运出四千一百五十一吨粮食，相当于这个港口过去一个月的运输出口量。曾在伟大的治淮运输工作中荣获“光荣模范船队”的陈凤鸣木帆船小组，创造了逆水日行五十船公里的新纪录。一般的木帆船也都由过去的日行二十船公里提高到日行三十船公里。蚌埠市的汽车工人，更创造了日行九百六十华里的全省最新纪录。
