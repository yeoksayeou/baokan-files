The students at the Speed-Learning Middle School for Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers in Tieling County, Liaoxi Province, are diligently and happily studying cultural and scientific knowledge. Currently, the school has over 500 students, more than 200 of whom have been recognized for their meritorious service in war. Notable figures include Qiu Baochun, a first-class meritorious volunteer soldier who received the Second Class Military Service Medal from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Liu Shun, a combat hero who earned a special merit award in the Tianjin Campaign during the Liberation War. Liu Yuqing, a first-degree disabled soldier with only half of his fingers remaining on both hands, practices writing with great determination and consistently maintains excellent grades. There are over a hundred students like Liu Yuqing who study diligently. Many have had their right upper limbs amputated, and they practice writing with their left hands. Bai Jinsheng, 37, struggled with memory when he first arrived at the school, taking two to three hours to solve a single arithmetic problem. Later, he resolved to wake up early and utilize Sunday breaks to review his lessons. After a year and a half of effort, he not only caught up with the curriculum but also became a school-wide model student.

The People's Government has provided these disabled revolutionary soldiers with excellent learning and living conditions. The school is situated at the foot of the scenic Longshou Mountain in Tieling County. It has spacious and clean classrooms, physics and chemistry labs equipped with numerous models and instruments, a library stocked with over 30 kinds of newspapers, 70 kinds of magazines, and various reference books, as well as a well-equipped infirmary and rest rooms. In addition to their studies, the students also pay attention to their health and physical fitness. Lin Fu, a student in the Fourth Grade, Class Two, who had his right lower leg amputated, was very weak when he first arrived at the school. After six months of effort, he can now skillfully perform four or five different exercises on the parallel bars, and his health has improved significantly. Over the past three years, more than 200 students with chronic illnesses have recovered. During physical examinations at the end of 1952, all the students had gained weight.

The students' cultural proficiency has improved rapidly. Most of those who were illiterate two years ago have now reached the level of a first-year junior high school student. Among the students who enrolled a year and a half ago, most of whom had only a second or third-grade elementary school education, have now advanced to the first or second year of junior high school. Because the students are able to quickly grasp cultural and scientific knowledge, the school, since its official establishment in 1950, has trained hundreds of outstanding cadres with both moral integrity and competence, who have been assigned to factories, mines, banks, schools, and rural areas to participate in construction work. Many have made new innovations in their work. Liu Shengyi, an agriculture student who graduated at the end of 1951 and is now the director of the Technical Extension Station of the State-owned Farm in Lishu County, Liaoxi Province, developed a method to increase rice production in 1952, which more than doubled the rice yield compared to the average yield of local farmers, earning enthusiastic praise from the local population.

Xinhua News Agency: This year, the People's Government has decided to construct a new three-story classroom building for the school with an area of 7,000 square meters. A senior high school will be established after the new school building is completed. At the same time, a garden for the students to visit will also be built near the new school building.

    辽西省铁岭县
    革命残废军人速成中学学员学习成绩显著
    辽西省铁岭县革命残废军人速成中学的学员，正在愉快而顽强地学习文化、科学知识。目前，这个学校共有五百多学员，其中有二百多人曾经在战争中立过功。著名的志愿军一等功臣、曾获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国二级军功章的邱宝春，在解放战争时期天津战役中立了特等功的战斗英雄刘顺等，都在这里学习。一等残废刘玉清两只手都只有半截指头，但他仍以极大的毅力练习写字，而且经常保持着优良的学习成绩。在这个学校里像刘玉清那样顽强地学习的学员共有一百多名，不少人的右上肢被截去，他们就用左手练习写字。三十七岁的白金生刚到学校时，由于记忆力不强，做一个算术题要两三个小时，后来，他下决心每天早起和利用星期天休息时间温习功课，这样，经过了一年半的努力，他不仅赶上了课程，还当了全校的学习模范。
    人民政府给这些革命残废军人安排了良好的学习和生活条件。这所学校设立在铁岭县风景优美的龙首山麓，校内有宽敞而整洁的教室，有设置着大量模型和仪器的理化试验室，有陈设着三十多种报纸和七十多种杂志及各种参考书籍的图书馆，还有设备良好的医务所和休养室。学员们除了努力学习外，也很注意保养和锻炼身体。四年级二班学员林富，因为截掉了右下肢，刚来学校时身体很弱，经过半年的努力，现在已能够在双杠上灵巧地玩四五种花样，身体也已强健起来。三年来，全校有二百多个慢性病患者都已恢复了健康。一九五二年年底检查身体时，学员们的体重都增加了。
    学员们的文化水平提高得很快。两年前的文盲，现在大部分都提高到初中一年级的水平；一年半以前入学的一批学员中，原来多数只有小学二、三年级的文化水平，现在也提高到初中一年或二年的程度了。由于学员们能够迅速掌握文化科学知识，这个学校从一九五零年正式成立以来，已先后培养出数百名德才兼备的优秀干部，分配到工厂、矿山、银行、学校和农村等各种岗位上去参加建设工作。在工作中，有许多人还有了新的创造。一九五一年年底毕业的农业班学员刘盛义，现在是辽西省梨树县国营农场技术推广站的主任，他曾在一九五二年创造了水稻增产方法，使水稻产量超过当地农民一般产量一倍多，受到当地群众的热烈赞扬。
    今年，人民政府决定给这个学校新建一幢面积达七千平方公尺的三层大楼的课堂；高级中学将在新校舍落成后成立。与此同时，一个专供学员们游览的花园也将在新校舍附近建筑起来。（新华社）
