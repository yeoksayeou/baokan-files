    The spring patriotic health campaign in most parts of the country has ended, and the work has transitioned to regular hygiene efforts, setting the stage for the year-round patriotic health movement.
    During this campaign, most regions reorganized and improved the organizations at all levels that lead the patriotic health movement; improved environmental hygiene by clearing away large amounts of garbage and manure accumulated during the winter, dredging ditches, and filling in low-lying areas; and constructed a large number of wells and toilets. The campaign particularly emphasized eliminating the larvae of disease-carrying insects. Large-scale fly pupae digging campaigns were launched in various locations. In Tianjin, 200,000 citizens participated, digging 25 tons of fly pupae from March 25th to the end of April. In the smaller city of Andong, 31 tons of fly pupae were dug up during the campaign. Shenyang dug up 57 tons in one month. Many areas in southern China that use chamber pots implemented the "manure tanks underground" method, eliminating conditions for fly breeding. People in many areas created various methods for eliminating fly pupae and mosquito larvae.
    Leaders in most regions and units were serious and responsible for this campaign, which was a major factor in its success. For example, the Vice Chairman of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government personally organized over 1,200 staff members from provincial and Jinzhou municipal organs to dig fly pupae. The Mayor of Lüda and the heads of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee went deep into residential households and factories to inspect hygiene work. As a result, the hygiene work in these areas was done very well. However, there were also leaders in a few regions and units who emphasized heavy production tasks and did not pay attention to hygiene work, which meant that the campaign in these areas failed to achieve results or was not launched at all. Many facts from this campaign once again illustrate that hygiene work and production can be combined and have direct benefits for production. For example, at the Shenyang Woolen Mill, the incidence of illness among workers was greatly reduced because the factory leadership emphasized hygiene work. With the improvement of hygiene conditions, new prospects appeared in production. The biggest factors affecting the quality of the mill’s tweed, serge, and blankets in the past were "color defects" and "stain infiltration," which were mostly caused by unclean machines and interiors. Since the launch of the spring patriotic health campaign, the factory has combined machine cleaning with the "excellent product campaign," and "color defects" have been greatly reduced. The quality in March this year reached 99.7%.
    Extensive and in-depth publicity and education work was carried out in various places during this campaign, which played a significant role in mobilizing the masses to participate in hygiene work. The Jilin Railway Administration dispatched a large number of sanitation and epidemic prevention personnel to conduct publicity in the residences of employees, so the masses were able to consciously and actively participate in hygiene work, and sanitation conditions were greatly improved. The Tonghua Vehicle Depot, a sanitary dead spot in last year's patriotic health campaign, has completely changed its unsanitary conditions in this campaign and is now in a position to issue a challenge to hygiene model units in the railway system. At the start of the campaign, the Health Section of the Foziling Reservoir Headquarters specially compiled and printed 2,000 copies of popular hygiene knowledge textbooks and distributed them to workers on the construction site, so that the workers received general hygiene education. Visualized propaganda was even more popular with the masses. Nanjing, Wuhan, Kaifeng and other places used specimens and models explaining the growth process of flies to educate the masses and promote the fly pupae digging craze.
    The hygiene models selected last year played an active role in promoting the campaign. Lu Dama, a national first-class hygiene model in Nanjing, regularly conducted publicity and education among the masses, and many people proposed to learn from her example. The National Second-Class Hygiene Model Unit, the Second Primary School of the Jinzhou Railway Administration, not only implemented existing hygiene systems but also closely combined them with teaching, health care and other work, driving the patriotic health campaign in railway schools throughout the Jinzhou Railway Bureau and large, medium, and small schools in Liaoxi Province. The masses of Wangjiapo in Chongqing, which was rated as a national third-class hygiene model unit last year, did a good job in hygiene work by adopting working methods of mutual assistance and mutual inspection, which had a great impact locally.
    According to reports from inspection teams dispatched by the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other nine provinces and Shanghai and other four cities, the campaign has basically reversed the situation in which the hygiene work of government offices lagged behind that of the residents. However, factories still lag behind. City hygiene work is generally better than that in rural areas. The military system did a very good job in this campaign.
    Among the areas visited by the inspection teams, most areas still have the following common shortcomings and deviations: the management of the catering industry and industries related to public health is poor, and there is insufficient specific guidance and health education for employees in these industries; the sanitary conditions of collective dormitories are not good; and some areas have a coercive command style in hygiene work. These shortcomings and deviations are gradually being corrected.

### 各地春季爱国卫生运动结束

    各地春季爱国卫生运动结束
    为了给今年全年的爱国卫生运动打好基础，全国极大部分地区今春都进行了一次春季爱国卫生突击运动。现在各地运动都已结束，转入了经常性的卫生工作。
    在这次突击运动中，大部分地区都整顿和健全了领导爱国卫生运动的各级组织；改善了环境卫生：清除了冬季积集下来的大量垃圾和粪便，疏浚了沟渠，填平了洼地；并修建了大批水井和厕所。这次突击运动特别着重进行了消灭病媒昆虫的幼虫的工作。各地都展开了大规模的挖蝇蛹运动。天津市二十万市民参加了挖蛹运动，从三月二十五日到四月底，已挖了二十五吨重的蝇蛹。人口较少的安东市，在突击运动中也挖了三十一吨蝇蛹。沈阳市在一个月中挖了五十七吨。江南很多使用马桶的地区实行了“粪缸下地”的办法，消除了苍蝇孳生的条件。不少地区的群众创造了各种消灭蝇蛹和孑孓的方法。
    大部分地区和单位的领导人对这次突击运动是认真负责的。这是突击运动能做好的主要因素。例如辽西省人民政府副主席亲自组织省级及锦州市级机关一千二百多工作人员挖蝇蛹。旅大市市长和中共旅大市委员会的负责人都深入居户、工厂中检查卫生工作。所以这些地区的卫生工作都做得很好。但也有少数地区和单位的领导人强调生产任务重，不重视卫生工作，使这些地区和单位的突击运动未能收到成效或根本没有开展起来。这次突击运动中的许多事实，再度说明了卫生工作和生产可以结合起来，而且对生产有直接的好处。例如沈阳毛织厂，由于工厂领导方面重视卫生工作，工人患病率大为减少。随着卫生状况的改善，生产上也出现了新的气象。该厂生产呢子、哔叽和毛毯，以往影响产品质量最大的是“色花”和“污浸”，而“色花”和“污浸”大半是由于机器和室内不清洁所造成的。自从开展春季爱国卫生突击运动以来，该厂把擦洗机器和“优良产品运动”结合起来，“色花”大大减少，今年三月份的质量达到了百分之九十九点七。
    各地在这次突击运动中进行了广泛深入的宣传教育工作，对发动群众参加卫生工作起了很大作用。吉林铁路管理局由于出动了大批卫生防疫人员深入职工住宅宣传，所以群众都能自觉地积极参加卫生工作，卫生状况大为改进。去年爱国卫生运动中的死角——通化车辆段，在这次突击运动中已经完全改变了过去不卫生的情况，他们已有条件向铁路系统的卫生模范单位发出挑战书。佛子岭水库指挥部的卫生科在突击运动开始时，特地编印了二千份通俗卫生常识课本，发给工地上的职工，使工地职工普遍受到了卫生教育。形象化的宣传更受群众欢迎。南京、武汉、开封等地利用说明苍蝇生长过程的标本和模型向群众宣传，推动了挖蝇蛹热潮。
    去年评选的卫生模范在突击运动中起了积极的推动作用。南京市的全国甲等卫生模范鲁大妈经常向群众进行宣传教育，许多群众提出要学习鲁大妈的榜样。全国乙等卫生模范单位——锦州铁路管理局第二小学不但执行了既有的卫生制度，并且和教学、保健等工作密切结合起来，带动了全锦州铁路局的铁路学校及辽西省的大、中、小学校的爱国卫生突击运动。去年被评为全国丙等卫生模范单位的重庆市王家坡的群众，采取互助及互相检查的工作方法做好了卫生工作，在当地起了很大影响。
    据中央爱国卫生运动委员会派赴浙江、江苏等九个省份及上海等四个城市的检查组的报告，在这次突击运动中，基本上已扭转了过去机关的卫生工作落后于居民群众的局面。但工厂仍是落在后面。城市的卫生工作一般说来比农村做得好。部队系统这次突击运动做得很好。
    在检查组到过的地区中，大部分地区还存在着下列共同的缺点和偏向：对饮食行业及有关公共卫生的行业的管理工作做得较差，对上述行业的从业人员的具体指导和卫生教育工作也做得不够；集体宿舍的卫生状况不好；有些地区在卫生工作中有强迫命令作风。这些缺点和偏向正在逐渐纠正中。
