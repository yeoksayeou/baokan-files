　　World Federation of Trade Unions Sends Letter to "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"
　　Demanding Concerted Action to Defend the Interests of Working People

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, May 8th】 TASS, Vienna, May 5th: The World Federation of Trade Unions has released a letter addressed to the leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," signed by World Federation of Trade Unions President Vittorio and General Secretary Saillant, requesting them to take concerted action to protect the economic and social interests of working people.
　　The letter states: The economic and social conditions of working people in capitalist countries and colonial countries are deteriorating daily. The World Federation of Trade Unions has a responsibility to defend the vital interests of working people, and therefore requests that you jointly take concerted action to strive to raise the living standards of working people in capitalist countries and colonial countries, eliminate unemployment, and improve and expand social insurance and social welfare. The World Federation of Trade Unions requests that your organization endorse the memorandum submitted to the United Nations by the International Conference for the Protection, Improvement, and Expansion of Social Protection and Insurance held in Vienna in March, and support the social insurance plan adopted at this conference.
　　The letter also says: In the current situation, workers are primarily bearing the entire burden of the arms race, which means that they can never improve their material and cultural levels unless peace is achieved. All working people demand that trade union organizations unite their strength in every way to defend world peace. The letter requests the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and the World Federation of Trade Unions to take concerted action to support the movement of people in all countries demanding a cessation of bloodshed in Korea and the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.
　　The letter concludes by stating: The World Federation of Trade Unions is willing to hold a meeting with representatives of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" to discuss all measures to promote the defense of world peace and all issues related to the defense of the economic and social rights of working people.

    世界工联致函“国际自由工会联合会”
    要求采取一致行动保卫劳动人民的利益
   【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社维也纳五日讯：世界工会联合会发表了由世界工联主席维多里奥和总书记赛扬署名的致“国际自由工会联合会”领导人的信件，信件要求他们采取一致行动，以保护劳动人民的经济和社会利益。
    信件说：在资本主义国家和各殖民地国家内，劳动人民的经济和社会条件日趋恶化。世界工联有责任保卫劳动人民的切身利益，所以要求你们共同采取一致行动，以争取提高资本主义国家和殖民地国家内的劳动人民的生活水平，消除失业现象，改善并扩大社会保险和社会福利。世界工联要求你们的组织赞同三月间在维也纳举行的国际保卫、改进和扩大社会保护与保险会议送交联合国的备忘录，并支持这次会议上通过的社会保险计划。
    信件又说：在目前的情况下，工人们首先负担着扩军运动的整个重担，这就意味着：除非和平得以实现，否则他们决不可能提高他们的物质与文化水平。全体劳动人民要求各工会组织以一切方法来团结他们的力量，以便保卫世界和平。信件要求“国际自由工会联合会”和世界工联采取一致行动，支持各国人民要求在朝鲜停止流血和要求缔结五大国和平公约的运动。
    信件最后表示：世界工联愿和“国际自由工会联合会”的代表举行会议，以讨论促进保卫世界和平的一切措施及有关保卫劳动人民的经济与社会权利的一切问题。
