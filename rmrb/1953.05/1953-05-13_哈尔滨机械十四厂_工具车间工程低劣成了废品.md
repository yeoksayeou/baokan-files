Harbin Mechanical Factory No. 14

Tool Workshop Project Shoddy Work Resulted in Scrap

The tool workshop built last year by Harbin Mechanical Factory No. 14 is of very poor quality. Almost no part of the entire concrete project is intact. "Exposed rebar," "dog holes," "honeycomb," and "pockmarks" are everywhere. The most serious problem is with the two crane beams. After technical inspection, it has been proven that cranes cannot run on them. Now, the entire workshop has become "scrap" and can only be converted into offices by laying floors.

The reason why this workshop became "scrap" is mainly due to the lack of technical management and the irresponsibility of the construction site director. The Fifth Engineering Department of the former Northeast Industrial Department Engineering Construction Company was responsible for this construction task. The main link of the entire project—the concrete project—was carried out without leadership or supervision. The concrete construction worker was concurrently held by the construction site director Zhao Wensheng, but in reality, Zhao Wensheng rarely managed the concrete work. No one inspected during the construction process, the handover system between work procedures was not implemented, and no one managed watering and maintenance after the concrete was poured. Serious violations of operating procedures during the project were not stopped in time. The crane beam accident was mainly caused by rebar binding and tamping workers violating operating procedures.

After this accident occurred, the relevant leading authorities conducted an inspection, and the relevant personnel made self-criticisms. The construction site director Zhao Wensheng, who was mainly responsible, was given a demerit.

### 哈尔滨机械十四厂  工具车间工程低劣成了废品

    哈尔滨机械十四厂
    工具车间工程低劣成了废品
    哈尔滨机械十四厂去年修筑的工具车间，质量非常低劣，全部混凝土工程，几乎没有一处是完整的，“露筋”、“狗洞”、“蜂窝”、“麻面”，到处都有。最严重的地方是两根吊车横梁，经过技术检查，已证明无法行驶吊车。现在，整个车间成了“废品”，只能改铺楼板作办公室用。
    这个车间变成“废品”的原因，主要是技术管理无人负责和工地主任不负责任。担负这一施工任务的是原东北工业部工程建设公司的第五工程处，整个工程的主要环节——混凝土工程，是在无领导无监督的情况下进行的。混凝土施工员由工地主任赵文升兼任，但实际上赵文升很少管混凝土的工作。施工过程中无人检查，工序之间的交接班制度也没有执行，打好混凝土后，浇水、保养也没有人管。在工程进行时严重违反操作规程的事情未得到及时制止。吊车横梁事故就主要是扎钢筋和捣固工人违反了操作规程造成的。
    这一事故发生后，有关领导机关进行了检查，有关人员都作了检讨，并予主要负责人工地主任赵文升记大过一次处分。
