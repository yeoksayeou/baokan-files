Hubei Province is Intensively Carrying Out Drought Resistance, Seedling Protection, Production and Disaster Relief Work
The drought situation in some areas of Hubei Province is still very serious. The broad masses of farmers in the drought-stricken areas have actively launched a movement to prevent and combat drought, protect seedlings, and cultivate seedlings.

Since last winter, most parts of Hubei Province have not had heavy rains. Most of the ponds and dams have dried up, and rivers and ditches in some areas have dried up. As of early May, 32 counties with a population of 12 million in the province were affected by drought, and about 10 million mu of paddy fields had no water for transplanting rice seedlings. In the face of this serious situation, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on May 5, putting forward the following emergency measures: (1) The Provincial Party Committee should immediately mobilize a large number of cadres from directly affiliated agencies to form working groups, led by responsible comrades from the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, to go deep into the drought-stricken areas to lead the drought resistance and disaster relief work. Local prefectural committees and county committees should also form working groups to go deep into the countryside, concentrate their efforts to do a good job in drought resistance, rice transplanting, disaster relief and replanting. Other tasks that conflict with drought resistance must be rearranged. (2) In the drought resistance movement, ideological mobilization work should be carried out among the broad masses of farmers, patiently educating and encouraging the masses to overcome the drought, and establishing the idea that "man will conquer nature." (3) Strengthen the management of water conservancy irrigation, conserve water, and explore water sources to strive to transplant rice seedlings in drought-stricken paddy fields. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also instructed all localities to be vigilant in the drought resistance movement and to promptly punish counter-revolutionaries who undermine production and disrupt drought resistance; in the drought resistance movement, cadres at all levels must not only overcome commandism, but also oppose the passive mood of inaction; all economic departments must also serve the drought resistance work. The Hubei Provincial People's Government also held an emergency meeting on the 7th, deciding to vigorously mobilize the masses to protect seedlings and cultivate seedlings, and to transplant rice seedlings as much as possible in areas where rice seedlings can be transplanted. At the same time, prepare drought-resistant crops and late rice seeds, so that they can be sown even if rice seedlings cannot be transplanted due to drought.

Around May 10, it rained generally throughout the province. The Xiaogan, Huanggang, Jingzhou, Yichang, and Enshi prefectures that had been affected by drought in the past all received 20 to 30 millimeters of rainfall. The Xiangyang Prefecture received less rainfall, and the drought situation is still very serious due to the long-term lack of rain in the past. The Hubei Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee Office issued an emergency notice again on the 11th, requiring party and government leading organs at all levels to resolutely implement the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the notice of the Provincial Government, and to effectively lead the masses in drought prevention and drought resistance, production and disaster relief, and must not become ideologically paralyzed because of a little rain.

    湖北省紧张进行抗旱保苗生产救灾工作
    湖北省部分地区旱象仍很严重。受旱地区的广大农民，已积极展开防旱抗旱，保苗育苗运动。
    从去冬以来湖北省大部地区一直未下大雨，塘、堰大半干涸，部分地区河沟已经断流。到五月上旬为止，全省有三十二个县，一千二百万人口地区受旱，约有一千万亩秧田无水插秧，面对这一严重情况，中共湖北省委在五月五日发出指示，提出了如下的紧急办法：（一）省委立即动员直属机关大批干部组成工作团，以省委、省府负责同志带队，深入受旱地区，领导抗旱救灾工作。各地地委、县委也要组成工作组，深入农村，集中力量搞好抗旱插秧、救灾补种工作。其他与抗旱有矛盾的工作，都须重新安排。（二）在抗旱运动中，要对广大农民进行思想发动工作，耐心教育和鼓励群众战胜旱灾，树立“人定胜天”的思想。（三）加强水利灌溉的管理，节约用水，开辟水源争取受旱水田能插上秧。中共湖北省委还指示各地在抗旱运动中要提高警惕性，及时惩办破坏生产，破坏抗旱的反革命分子；在抗旱运动中，各级干部既要克服命令主义，又要反对束手束脚的消极情绪；各经济部门也要为抗旱工作服务。湖北省人民政府也于七日召开紧急会议，决定大力发动群众保苗育苗，凡能插秧的地区尽量插秧，同时准备抗旱作物及晚稻种子，以便在因旱不能插秧时也能播种。
    五月十日前后，全省各地普遍落了雨，过去受旱的孝感、黄冈、荆州、宜昌、恩施等专区都降雨二、三十公厘，襄阳专区落雨较小，且因过去长期缺雨，目前旱象仍很严重。湖北省生产救灾委员会办公室于十一日又发出紧急通知，要求各级党、政领导机关仍须坚决贯彻省委指示和省府通告，切实领导群众防旱抗旱、生产救灾，决不能因为下了一点雨而思想麻痹。（本报武汉记者站）
