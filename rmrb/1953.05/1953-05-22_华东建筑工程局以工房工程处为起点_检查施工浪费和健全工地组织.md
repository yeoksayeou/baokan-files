    East China Construction Engineering Bureau Takes Workshop Engineering Department as Starting Point
    Inspect Construction Waste and Improve Site Organization
    [This newspaper dispatch] The East China Construction Engineering Bureau, in order to thoroughly correct the widespread phenomenon of serious lack of responsibility currently existing on construction sites, is starting with the Workshop Engineering Department and undertaking systematic organizational reform work to improve site organization. At the same time, it will launch a mass movement to check quality, waste, and lack of responsibility, and gradually establish various responsibility systems to overcome the phenomenon of lack of responsibility and strive to complete construction tasks.
    The shortcomings of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau's Workshop Engineering Department in construction are mainly manifested in the fact that engineering progress plans are often not completed on schedule, the quality of some projects is poor, material waste is significant, and "waiting for work" and "idling" phenomena occur widely due to unreasonable labor organization, inadequate planning, poor workflow, and untimely supply of materials and tools. One of the reasons for these serious situations is the unreasonable production management organization, chaotic systems, and lack of responsibility for various tasks.
    Recently, the East China Construction Engineering Bureau inspected several construction sites of the Shanghai 20,000-Household Workers' Housing Construction Project undertaken by the Workshop Engineering Department and initially discovered serious phenomena of lack of responsibility in construction scheduling, material management, and engineering quality. For example, in terms of construction scheduling, the 20,000-household housing is built on nine bases in the near suburbs of Shanghai. On these bases, more than 20,000 construction workers use extremely complex large-scale assembly-line construction stations for work, which requires strong on-site construction management organizations to separately manage them. However, this is not the case. The construction management work on each site is not under unified command, the relationship between the construction management organization and the construction brigades and teams is unclear, and they do not communicate with each other, so solving problems is slow and delayed. Because the construction site is not under unified command, there are phenomena of lack of coordination or even mutual conflict between construction brigades, teams, and work types. For example, when the housing brigade was doing exterior plastering, the road brigade removed the scaffolding and lime pools needed for exterior plastering in order to fill earth; road projects were carried out before the ditch and channel projects were completed, so that some of the completed road surfaces had to be dug up and repaired. In terms of material management, the amount of building materials required for the 20,000-household housing is very large. The green bricks required can be used to build a 250-kilometer-long, seven-foot-high wall, enough to surround the Shanghai urban area twice. However, the organization managing materials on the construction site is very weak. Each material person is responsible for the receipt and issuance of one or two kinds of materials for more than a dozen work sections. They only take care of counting and stamping, but do not keep accounts. The storage and allocation of materials are not subject to fixed procedures and systems. Anyone can take and use inventory items at will, which workers call "a warehouse where anyone can take materials without responsibility." Therefore, everyone picks the good ones when taking materials. Materials transferred back and forth on the construction site can be used by anyone who stops a truck. Yellow sand, ballast, bricks, tiles, and wooden boards are everywhere on the construction site. Workers said: "Our eyes cannot bear to look down, seeing the national property being wasted everywhere, it really hurts." Even more serious is that the construction site cafeteria arbitrarily sends people to the construction site to pick up wood as firewood, including good materials such as usable floorboards, roof panels, and brick thresholds. It is understood that the Fifteenth Cafeteria of the East Zone construction site picked up more than 50,000 catties of firewood in more than two months this year, and the usable good materials cannot be estimated. In addition, due to impractical material allocation plans, the planned allocation numbers exceed actual needs, and improper material stacking locations, a large amount of material is backlogged and losses occur in transfers. For example, the thirty-sixth work section of 170 houses in the East Zone had an excess of 200,000 green bricks, and the broken brick losses caused by transfers in the thirty-sixth and thirty-ninth work sections of Base No. 2 reached 50 cubic meters. As for the use of raw materials, a lot of waste is also caused because there are no fixed standards for material specifications and construction operations. For example, when doing indoor landing cement, the cement aggregate flows straight down due to the excessive size of the ballast, resulting in each ten households consuming fifteen or sixteen more bags of cement. In terms of engineering quality, from the beginning of the construction of the housing, the leadership had the idea that engineering progress came first. The full-time organizations for technical guidance and quality inspection in the construction organization are very weak and lack the necessary systems. There are no standards for housing quality, and there are no operating procedures. The section command posts, construction brigades, and construction teams' technical personnel all concentrate on material work and cannot take care of project quality. There is no shift handover system between work types, or although there is a shift handover system, it has never been implemented, resulting in extremely poor engineering quality. One hundred and eighty houses in Bases No. 6 and 7 of the West Zone had to be reworked because the walls were too concave and convex in many places. According to the inspection results of 280 houses in Base No. 1 of the East Zone, there are more than twenty kinds of major and minor problems in the exterior plastering alone.
    In order to fundamentally change the above situation, the East China Construction Engineering Bureau decided to carry out systematic organizational reform work in May and June of this year. It is now selecting Base No. 1 of the Workshop Engineering Department as the key point to start establishing the site director responsibility system, implement the regional management system, strengthen functional organizations, and rationally adjust labor organizations so that labor organizations adapt to the new site management organization in order to overcome the past chaos of multiple leadership, overlapping layers, unclear division of labor, unclear responsibilities, disjointed work processes, and uneven workload. At the same time, it will soon convene a meeting of employee representatives of the Workshop Engineering Department to mobilize the masses to carry out movements to check quality, waste, and lack of responsibility, thereby effectively rectifying management organizations at all levels, establishing the site director responsibility system and various responsibility systems to ensure project quality, reduce labor and material waste, eliminate the phenomenon of lack of responsibility, and fully prepare for accepting new tasks this year.

### 华东建筑工程局以工房工程处为起点  检查施工浪费和健全工地组织

    华东建筑工程局以工房工程处为起点
    检查施工浪费和健全工地组织
    【本报讯】华东建筑工程局为了彻底纠正目前工地上普遍存在的严重无人负责现象，正以工房工程处为起点，着手进行有系统的组织改革工作，以健全工地组织，同时，并将通过群众性的查质量、查浪费、查无人负责运动，逐步建立各项负责制，克服无人负责现象，争取完成建筑任务。
    华东建筑工程局工房工程处在施工中的缺点，主要表现在工程进度计划经常不能按期完成，有些工程的质量低劣，材料浪费很大以及由于劳动组织不合理、计划不周、流水不通、材料工具供应不及时而普遍发生的“窝工”“等工”现象。造成这些严重情况的原因之一，就是由于生产管理机构不合理、制度混乱和各项工作无人负责。
    最近，华东建筑工程局检查了工房工程处承建的上海市二万户工人住宅建筑工程的若干工地，初步发现在施工调度、材料管理和工程质量等方面的严重无人负责现象。例如在施工调度方面，二万户工房分建在上海市区近郊的九个基地上。在这些基地上，有二万多建筑工人采用了极其复杂的大规模的流水施工站进行工作，这就需要强有力的现场施工管理机构来分别掌握。但事实并不如此。各个工地上的施工管理工作无人统一指挥，施工管理组织与施工大队、中队之间的关系不明，互不联系，因此解决问题也就拖拉迟缓。由于工地无人统一指挥，各个施工大队与大队、中队与中队、工种与工种之间就发生互不配合、甚至互相冲突的现象。如房屋大队正在进行外粉刷时，道路大队为了填土，拆去了外粉刷需用的脚手架和石灰池；沟渠工程尚未完成，就进行道路工程，以致一部分做好的路面不得不挖去重修。在材料管理方面，二万户工房所需建筑材料的数量十分庞大，其中需用的青砖就可以砌成二百五十公里长、七呎高的围墙，足足可围绕上海市区两周。而工地上管理材料的组织却十分薄弱，每一个材料人员要负责十几个工段一、二种材料的收发工作，他们只管点收盖章，但不记账。材料的保管与拨发均无一定的手续和制度。库存物品任何人可随意拿用，工人称之为：“任人取用的无人负责的仓库”，因此，取用材料时大家都拣好的。在工地来回转拨的材料，任何人都可拦车使用。工地上遍地是黄砂、道碴、砖瓦、木板。工人说：“我们的眼睛不忍朝下看，看到满地都是被浪费着的国家资财，真叫人心痛。”更严重的是工地食堂任意派人到工地拾木料当柴烧，其中有可用的楼板、屋面板、压砖槛等好料。据了解，东区工地第十五食堂今年两个多月内，就拾去木柴达五万多斤，其中可用的好料无法估计。此外，由于材料调配计划不切实际，计划调配数字超过实际需要，及材料堆置地点不当，造成了大批材料的积压和转拨的损失。如东区第三十六工段一百七十户房屋就多下青砖二十万块，二号基地三十六、三十九工段因来回转拨所造成的碎砖损失即达五十立公方。至于在原材料使用方面，因材料规格与施工操作都没有一定标准，也造成很大浪费。如做室内落地水泥时，由于道碴过大，水泥三合土直往下流，使每十户房屋多耗用水泥十五、六包。在工程质量方面，从工房工程开始兴建起，领导方面就有工程进度第一的思想。施工组织中技术指导和质量检查的专职机构很薄弱，缺乏必要的制度。房屋质量既无标准，操作也没有规程。段务指挥所、施工大队和中队的施工技术人员都集中力量搞材料工作，无法照顾工程质量。工种与工种之间没有交接班制度，或虽有交接班制度但从未执行，结果造成工程质量极为低劣的情形。西区六、七号基地曾发生一百八十户房屋因墙身过于凹凸，不少地方只得返工重修。东区根据一号基地二百八十户房屋的检查结果，单外粉刷一项就有大小毛病二十余种。
    为了根本改变上述情况，华东建筑工程局决定在今年五、六月间进行有系统地组织改革工作，现正选择工房工程处一号基地为重点，开始建立工地主任负责制，并实行区域管理制，加强职能组织，合理地调整劳动组织，使劳动组织与新的工地管理组织相适应，以克服过去领导多头、层次重叠、分工不明、职责不清、工序前后脱节、忙闲不均等混乱现象。同时，即将召开工房工程处职工代表会议，发动群众开展查质量、查浪费、查无人负责运动，借此切实整顿各级管理机构，建立工地主任负责制和各种负责制度，以保证工程质量，减少劳动力和材料浪费，消灭无人负责现象，并为接受今年度的新任务作好充分准备。
