The CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee, in order to systematically cultivate theoretical education cadres, carry out formal theoretical education for cadres in service, and improve the political and theoretical level of cadres to meet the urgent needs of national construction, held a training course for theory instructors from December 11th of last year to March 5th of this year. The participants included 223 full-time and part-time theory instructors from county (city) level and above. All trainees had a cultural level of middle school or above and a certain theoretical foundation and struggle experience. The class was divided into two levels (level one with 156 people, level two with 67 people). The learning content: level one was "Reader of Political Common Sense"; level two mainly focused on Chapters 9 to 12 of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, combined with the study of relevant documents on the nature, composition, and future of China's New Democratic economy, as well as the basic policies on industry, agriculture, commerce, and political power construction.

After nearly three months of study, the trainees generally improved their theoretical and ideological understanding. In terms of economic construction: they learned about the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy, further recognizing the interrelationship and role of industry, agriculture, and commerce in the Soviet Union's construction of a socialist country, thereby criticizing the erroneous thinking of cadres who belittled commerce. They learned about the history of the Soviet Union's struggle to realize socialist industrialization, realizing that without national industrialization, there would be no national prosperity and further improvement of people's lives, thereby recognizing the importance of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to accelerate China's industrialization. At the same time, they severely criticized the erroneous thinking that China's large-scale economic construction was to "revive everything" and "large-scale everywhere." They learned about the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet countryside, further realizing that only collectivization is the correct way for the small-peasant economy to finally get rid of poverty, thereby more deeply appreciating the importance of Chairman Mao's "get organized" and "the serious problem is educating the peasants." Many trainees also reviewed their past biases of coercion or laissez-faire in leading the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the study, because it was combined with the study of China's economic problems, they had a further understanding of the transitional nature of China's New Democratic economy, the nature, role, interrelationship, and development prospects of the five economic components.

In terms of Party building: in addition to a more systematic study of the construction of the Party in terms of organization, they further recognized the construction of the Party in terms of ideology and politics, especially the strengthening of criticism and self-criticism and the strengthening of the Party's theoretical education work. After studying the third part of Malenkov's report, most comrades wrote learning experiences, in which they examined their past attitudes towards criticism and self-criticism. At the time of the graduation exam, 64 people also wrote papers on strengthening the political and theoretical education of cadres in service; most of the papers reviewed the past bias of belittling cadre education work and put forward specific methods for strengthening their own learning, improving cadre education, and being good theory instructors in the future.

In terms of political power construction: through study, they initially understood the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state; recognized the superiority of the New Democratic People's Congress and the National People's Congress system, thereby criticizing the erroneous understanding of some comrades who believed that holding the People's Congress was "too troublesome," "ineffective," and "not as good as holding a cadre meeting," and clearly recognized that the construction of political power is the premise for ensuring the development of the New Democratic economy and national industrialization, and that economic construction is the foundation for greatly strengthening and consolidating the New Democratic political power.

In addition, they also gained a further understanding of the nature, characteristics, objects, and driving force of the Chinese revolution, as well as the current international situation.

The reasons for obtaining the above gains are first and foremost the leadership's attention and support for this work. Two months before the start of the school, the Provincial Party Committee began preparations for the training class's teaching and living affairs. Comrade Pan Zili, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, reviewed and approved the teaching plan before the start of the school, personally came to guide at the start of the school, and gave a report on the current domestic and international situation and the tasks of large-scale economic and cultural construction that our country has begun; the report emphasized the importance of strengthening the Party's theoretical education work at present, which greatly encouraged the trainees. Gan Yifei, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, in addition to giving two lectures, also often directly guided the class affairs work. Liu Geng, Shi Yizhi, and other four comrades of the Provincial Party Committee personally served as teachers and were able to teach conscientiously. This ensured the quality of teaching and successfully completed the teaching plan.

Secondly, the students have a high degree of learning enthusiasm. The students generally realized that their theoretical level could not meet the urgent requirements of the current work and the development of the objective situation, and realized that it was a glorious and important task to serve as the Party's theory instructor, and therefore actively responded to Secretary Pan Zili's call to complete the learning plan with a spirit of fighting assault. At the beginning of the study, they all made learning plans and learning conventions; during the study, they were able to consciously abide by the learning system and carry forward the excellent style of mutual supervision and mutual assistance. From beginning to end, the learning mood was full, and many comrades even conducted self-study on Sundays and holidays.

Thirdly, the following teaching principles and methods were implemented:

I. The content of the study is closely related to the current central tasks of the Party and adapts to the most urgent requirements of the learners. Therefore, it is not only welcomed by the students, but also supported by the leaders of all aspects, and thus the teaching task is completed very smoothly.

II. In teaching, attention was paid to the learning method of combining theory with practice. Most teachers were able to lecture by guiding students to connect with practice. When studying the economic construction part of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," in order to combine the study with China's economic construction issues, the responsible comrades made special reports on the basic policies of industry, agriculture, commerce, and cooperative undertakings, combined with the actual situation of the province's current work. In order to guide the students to correctly connect with reality, the teaching and research section always paid attention to correcting the students' biases in learning discussions, ensuring that they first deeply understood the contents of the document and then connected with reality. At the same time, it was stipulated that after the end of each unit of study, they should write learning experiences and hold symposiums to summarize the learning gains; at the end of the course, they should write a paper to test their achievements. Due to the above measures, the guiding role of theory for practice was strengthened, which aroused the students' interest in learning and improved the effect of learning.

III. The learning method of generalized understanding and focused in-depth study was adhered to. The teaching plan of the training class clearly stipulated the learning focus and requirements of each unit. At the beginning of each unit of study, the teaching and research section formulated key learning topics around the focus and requirements of the teaching plan, guiding students to concentrate their energy on the main problems and repeatedly think and study in depth. The study emphasized "don't be greedy for too many problems" and "don't pull too many reference documents," preventing the bias of "greed for too much without digesting" and "floating without entering."

IV. The learning steps were clearly grasped. Each learning unit was divided into seven steps: preview, listening, review, casual talk, classroom discussion, answering questions, and summary. After previewing, there was preparation for listening; after lecturing, the students were inspired to understand the spirit of the document, and the focus was clear; after reviewing, the students further understood the document in depth; after casual talk, some fragmented problems such as nouns were solved first, and preparations were made for "classroom discussion"; after "classroom discussion," the students exchanged their learning experiences, and after answering questions, the remaining problems of "classroom discussion" were solved; finally, the summary could make the overall content clearer and more systematic. According to the experience of three months, these seven steps have an important impact on the learning effect. During the learning process, writing notes was also encouraged to help thinking and memory. In addition, two tests and one award for learning models were conducted, which played a great role in promoting learning.

Through studying in the training class, the students not only gained certain theoretical knowledge and improved their ideological understanding, but also gained a set of methods for self-study and leading learning. Many students reflected that many measures in teaching methods this time were of great help to personal learning and leading cadre learning work. Therefore, the holding of this training class not only provided extremely favorable conditions for solving the problem of teaching "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" and "Reader of Political Common Sense" in the province in the future, but also will play an extremely important role in organizing and leading the political and theoretical learning of cadres in service throughout the province, especially in guiding learning methods.

    中共陕西省委举办理论教员训练班有收获
    中共陕西省委为有计划地培养理论教育干部，开展在职干部正规理论教育，提高干部政治理论水平，以适应国家建设的迫切需要，于去年十二月十一日至今年三月五日，举办了一次理论教员训练班。参加训练的人员，包括县（市）级以上的二百二十三名专职、兼职理论教员。所有学员都具有中学以上的文化水平和一定的理论基础与斗争经验。班内分设一、二两级（一级一百五十六人，二级六十七人）。学习内容：一级为“政治常识读本”；二级以“联共（布）党史简明教程”九章至十二章及苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件为主，结合学习了有关中国新民主主义经济的性质、成份、前途和工、农、商业及政权建设等基本政策的文件。
    经过近三个月的学习，使学员普遍在理论上、思想上提高了一步。在经济建设方面：学习了苏联新经济政策，进一步认识了苏联在建成社会主义国家中，工、农、商业之间的相互关系及其作用，从而批判了干部中轻视商业的错误思想。学习了苏联为实现社会主义国家工业化而斗争的历史，认识到没有国家工业化，便没有国家的富强和人民生活进一步改善的可能，从而认识到学习苏联先进经验，对加速我国工业化的重要意义。同时对那种认为我国大规模经济建设是要“百废俱兴”“事事大规模，到处大规模”的错误思想，也进行了严厉的批判。学习了苏联社会主义建设在农村的胜利，进一步认识到只有集体化才是小农经济最后摆脱贫困的正确途径，从而更深刻地体会到毛主席“组织起来”“严重的问题是教育农民”的重要意义。许多学员并检讨了以往在领导农村互助合作运动中强迫命令或放任自流的偏向。在学习中，由于结合研究了中国的经济问题，对于中国新民主主义经济的过渡性，五种经济成份的性质、作用、相互关系及其发展前途，也有了进一步的了解。
    在党的建设方面：除较系统地研究了党在组织方面的建设问题外，对于党在思想上、政治上的建设，特别是对于加强批评与自我批评和加强党的理论教育工作有了进一步的认识。在学习马林科夫报告第三部分后，多数同志写了学习心得，在心得中检查了自己过去对待批评与自我批评的态度，在结业考试时，还有六十四人写了有关加强在职干部政治理论教育的论文；大部分论文中，都检讨了过去轻视干部教育工作的偏向，提出了今后加强自己的学习和改进干部教育、当好理论教员的具体办法。
    在政权建设方面：经过学习，初步认识了马克思列宁主义的国家学说；认识到新民主主义的人民代表会议与人民代表大会的国家制度的优越性，从而批判了有些同志认为开人民代表大会“太麻烦”、“不起作用”、“不如开干部会”等错误认识，明确认识到政权建设是保证新民主主义经济发展和国家工业化的前提，而经济建设又是大大加强和巩固新民主主义政权的基础等问题。
    此外，对中国革命的性质、特点、对象、动力，以及当前的国际形势等问题也有了进一步的了解。
    获得以上收获的原因首先是领导方面对这一工作的重视和支持。省委在开学前两月，即开始进行了训练班的教学和生活事务方面的筹备工作。省委书记潘自力同志在开学前审订了教学计划，开学时亲临指导，并作了关于当前国内外形势和我国开始大规模经济建设与文化建设任务的报告；报告中强调了目前加强党的理论教育工作的重要意义，对学员鼓舞作用很大。省委宣传部甘一飞部长除担任两次讲课外，还经常直接指导班务工作。省委委员刘庚、时逸之等四同志亲任教员，并能认真讲授。这就保证了教学质量，并顺利地完成了教学计划。
    其次，是同学们具有高度的学习热情。同学们普遍认识到自己的理论水平不能适应当前工作和客观形势发展的迫切要求，认识到担任党的理论教员是光荣而重大的任务，因而积极地响应潘自力书记以战斗的突击的精神完成学习计划的号召。学习开始时都订了学习计划和学习公约；学习期间都能自觉地遵守学习制度，发扬互相督促互相帮助的优良作风。自始至终学习情绪饱满，许多同志甚至在星期日和假日进行自修。
    第三，贯彻了以下的教学方针和方法：
    一、学习内容，密切地联系着当前党的中心任务，适应着学习者最迫切的要求，因此不仅受到同学们欢迎，且受到各方面领导同志的支持，因而很顺利地完成了教学任务。
    二、在教学中，注意了理论联系实际的学习方法。多数教员都能以引导同学联系实际的方法进行讲授。在学习“联共（布）党史简明教程”经济建设部分时，为结合研究我国经济建设问题，曾由负责同志就工业、农业、商业及合作事业的基本政策结合本省当前工作的实际情况，分别作了专题报告，为了引导同学正确地联系实际，教务处随时注意纠正学员在学习讨论中的偏向，作到首先深刻了解文件内容，然后联系实际。同时规定每个单元学习结束后写学习心得，召开座谈会，总结学习收获：结业时写一篇论文以测验成绩。由于采取上述办法，就加强了理论对于实际的指导作用，引起了同学们的学习兴趣，也提高了学习的效果。
    三、坚持了概括了解、重点深入的学习方法。训练班教学计划明确规定了各单元的学习重点和要求。教务处在每单元学习开始时即围绕教学计划的重点和要求，拟出重点学习的题目，引导同学集中精力围绕主要问题，反复思考深入钻研。学习中强调“研究问题不要贪多”，“参考文件不要拉的多”，防止了“贪多不化”、“浮而不入”的偏向。
    四、明确地掌握了学习步骤。每一学习单元分为预习、听讲、复习、漫谈、课堂讨论、解答问题、总结等七个步骤进行。经过预习使听讲有了准备；经过讲课，启发了同学领会文件精神，重心明确；经过复习，使同学对文件进一步深入理解；经过漫谈，先解决一些名词等零碎问题，给“课堂讨论”做好准备；经过“课堂讨论”使同学交流了学习心得，经过解答问题解决了“课堂讨论”的遗留问题；最后总结就可使全盘内容更加明确而且系统化了。根据三个月的经验，这七个步骤对学习效果都有重要影响。在学习过程中并提倡写笔记以帮助思考和记忆。此外，还进行了两次测验和一次评奖学习模范，对推动学习的作用很大。
    通过在训练班的学习，不仅使同学获得了一定的理论知识，提高了思想认识，而且获得了自学与领导学习的一套方法。许多同学反映说：这次在教学方法上的许多措施，对个人的学习和领导干部学习工作都有极大帮助。因此，这次训练班的举办，不仅为解决全省今后学习“联共（布）党史简明教程”和“政治常识读本”的讲授问题提供了极有利的条件，而且在组织与领导全省在职干部的政治理论学习，特别是学习方法的指导上，也将会起着极其重要的作用。
