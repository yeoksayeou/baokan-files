    The CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee's Letter in Response to the Handling of Disaster Victims in the Shifo Temple Area

    The CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee wrote: The "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on April 21st criticized Shenyang's handling of the disaster victims in the Shifo Temple area. This criticism is basically correct. After the Municipal Committee received the Shifo Temple District Committee's report on the issue of disaster victims relocating on March 18th, it considered this issue to be serious. On March 20th, the Municipal Committee meeting discussed rural work and gave clear instructions on the Shifo Temple disaster victim issue: we must quickly resettle the disaster victims for production and continue to provide relief. The Municipal Committee's Agricultural Committee immediately acted according to the Municipal Committee's instructions. On April 7th and 13th, the Municipal Committee sent inspection teams twice to the Shifo Temple District and other areas where disaster victims lived to understand the situation of the disaster victims: the production problems of the disaster victims have been initially resolved after receiving relief; however, there was serious bureaucratism and commandism in the past handling of the disaster victims' relocation work. On April 25th, based on the results of the two inspections, the Municipal Committee convened relevant units and comrades to study and resolve the outstanding issues in the relocation of disaster victims, and initially clarified the following points:

    (1) Judging from the actual situation of the four administrative villages (Lujia, Dadingpao, Lamatai, and Wujianfang) north of the embankment, the Liao River poses a serious threat, the area is hit by disasters year after year, and relief is provided year after year. It was correct to mobilize the disaster victims to relocate at that time. However, when mobilizing the masses to relocate, the leaders only explained the relocation task without focusing on specific methods, policies, and issues that should be paid attention to, which led to the cadres below adopting serious coercive and commanding methods, turning a good thing into a bad one. This is due to the bureaucratic work style of the leadership. At the same time, in the relocation work, the work style of individual district cadres was extremely bad, causing serious consequences, and they should be appropriately punished.

    (2) The lack of proper resettlement after the disaster victims moved out is the main reason for the disaster victims returning. When dealing with the return of disaster victims, the Municipal People's Government instructed: "The disaster victims who have moved back should still be mobilized to move out, otherwise no relief will be provided." This is a bureaucratic instruction that does not understand the situation and is not realistic. Therefore, after the instruction was issued, the masses were very dissatisfied, and the district cadres could not implement it.

    (3) Although the living and production problems of the relocated disaster victims have been initially resolved, relief should continue to be provided in conjunction with production self-rescue to restore the production capacity of the disaster victims. At the same time, in order to be responsible for the lives and property of the relocated disaster victims and prevent problems before they occur, the government should help the disaster victims effectively solve the problem of disaster preparedness (floods). For the disaster victims who have not moved back (about two-thirds), their living and production problems should be quickly and properly resettled based on the results of the inspection so that they can settle down and produce, and educate them (explain the pros and cons) not to continue to move back.

    (4) The Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Suburban Work Office, and the Municipal Committee's Agricultural Committee each have different responsibilities for the improper handling of the disaster victims' relocation issue, and should conduct public self-criticism in the newspaper. The Municipal Committee attaches importance to and addresses this issue in a timely manner. The shortcoming is that it did not conduct in-depth inspections in a timely manner, but only assigned it to the Municipal Committee's Agricultural Committee, and did not contact the Shifo Temple District Committee in a timely manner, causing the District Committee to feel that the Municipal Committee was not managing it either.

    (5) Comrades Wu Junting and other three comrades of the Shifo Temple District Committee discovered these problems and repeatedly appealed to the higher-level Party and government organs and newspapers, which is a manifestation of being responsible to the people and responsible to the Party. This spirit is commendable and should be commended.

    Although the problem has been basically resolved, some of the issues still need to be further investigated, understood, and resolved.

### 中共沈阳市委会来信答复石佛寺区灾民的处理问题

专栏：对人民日报读者  批评建议的反应

    中共沈阳市委会来信答复石佛寺区灾民的处理问题
    中共沈阳市委会来信：四月二十一日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏对沈阳市处理石佛寺区灾民问题提出批评。这个批评基本上是正确的。三月十八日市委收到石佛寺区委会关于灾民搬家问题的报告后，认为这一问题是严重的。三月二十日市委会议讨论农村工作时，对石佛寺灾民问题有明确的指示：要迅速安置灾民生产，继续予以救济。市委农委即根据市委的指示做了。四月七日、十三日市委又两次派检查组去石佛寺区及其他有灾民居住区了解灾民的情况：灾民得到救济后生产问题已初步解决；但过去处理灾民搬家工作中有严重的官僚主义、命令主义。四月二十五日，市委根据两次检查的结果，召集了有关单位、有关同志研究解决灾民搬家中尚待解决的问题，初步明确了以下几点：
    （一）从堤北四个行政村（鲁家、大丁泡、拉马台、五间房）的实际情况来看，辽河危害严重，该地连年受灾，年年救济，当时动员灾民搬家是正确的。但在动员群众搬家时，领导上只交代了搬家任务而未着重交代具体做法、政策及应注意的问题，以致下边干部采用严重的强迫命令的办法，把好事办坏了。这是领导上的官僚主义作风所致。同时在搬家工作中，个别区干部作风极端恶劣，造成了严重恶果，应受到适当处分。
    （二）灾民搬出后缺乏妥善安置，这是灾民向回迁的主要原因。在处理灾民回迁时，市人民政府又指示说：“搬回之灾民仍动员搬出，否则不予救济。”这是不了解下情、不切合实际的官僚主义的指示。因此指示下达后，群众甚为不满，区里干部无法执行。
    （三）迁回之灾民生活与生产问题虽已得到初步解决，还应结合生产自救继续给以救济，使灾民恢复生产能力。同时为了对迁回灾民之生命财产负责，防患于未然，政府应帮助灾民切实解决备灾
    （水灾）的办法。对未搬回之灾民（约三分之二）应根据检查的结果，对他们的生活、生产问题迅速给以妥善安置，使之能安家生产，并教育他们（说明利害）不再继续迁回。
    （四）市人民政府、市郊区工作办事处和市委农委对处理灾民搬家问题不当各有不同责任，应在报纸上公开检讨。市委对这一问题的处理是重视的、及时的。缺点是没有及时深入检查，只布置给市委农委，没有及时与石佛寺区委取得联系，致使区委感觉市委也未管。
    （五）石佛寺区委吴俊庭等三同志发现了这些问题，并一再向上级党、政机关和报社呼吁，是对人民负责、对党负责的表现。这种精神是可嘉的，应予表扬。
    目前问题虽已基本上得到解决，但其中某些问题还需要继续调查了解，加以解决。
