    Joyful Beijing
  　By our reporters Liu Shiping and Chang Gong
    This year's "May Day" in Beijing is more joyful than in previous years. We have entered a new period of planned construction, and the century-long plan of industrialization is beginning this year through our diligent hands. Look at the grand parade or the all-night singing and dancing; listen to the oaths of those who defend and build the motherland or the congratulations from friends from all over the world. All this fully reflects the firm determination of our people to defend and build the motherland, and also fully demonstrates the noble desire of the people of our great motherland to love and defend peace.
    On this morning, there was a light drizzle, but it did not stop people's joy. The marching队伍 came to Tiananmen Square from all directions. Many people, wearing clothes soaked through, marched forward with their heads held high and singing loudly. Some teams that arrived early formed countless circles, dancing heartily to the sound of the rain. Some girls and children's team members covered the鮮花 and 白鴿 with their own headscarves and handkerchiefs, dancing and singing wildly. At exactly ten o'clock in the morning, our beloved leader Chairman Mao, to the resounding music and singing of "The East is Red," stepped onto the Tiananmen Gate tower. Hundreds of thousands of people forgot that they were in the rain, and everyone simultaneously raised red flags, waved鮮花, and the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party" resounded throughout the city. People's joy cannot be described in words, because real life has made people realize that our great motherland is moving from victory to victory and will continue to move to greater victories. People from the western suburbs can tell you that in the fields outside Xizhimen and Fuxingmen, a desolate place before liberation, the buildings of government offices and schools now stand one after another in the sky. The eastern suburban industrial zone is also changing with each passing day. Existing factories can produce the latest products, and new factories are also starting construction one after another. Some people will happily say: the once stinking Longxu Ditch and the dilapidated Taoranting have now become beautiful scenic spots, a good place for the working people to rest; today, on the construction site outside Andingmen, scaffolding is densely erected around the Temple of Earth like a forest. As long as you take a trip outside the city, you can see horse-drawn carts and trucks loaded with sand, stone, bricks, and tiles, racing each other on the asphalt roads.
    The construction within Beijing is also progressing rapidly. In the past, people said that the tallest building in Beijing was the Beijing Hotel, but the newly built Peace Hotel last year has surpassed it. This year, the area of capital construction will be more than twice that of last year, and it will also develop towards high-rise buildings. Take municipal construction as an example! The Beijing Public Automobile Company, which used to operate on a "eat what you sell" basis, once had such difficulties that it did not have a single vehicle. Now it can operate 158 vehicles every day, increasing to 170 vehicles on Sundays. Every day, it transports more than 120,000 people to various work and production positions inside and outside the city. On Sundays, it transports more than 200,000 people to the Workers' Cultural Palace and the scenic spots of Beihai, Temple of Heaven, and Longevity Hill.
    In such tremendous changes, the working people of Beijing, especially the working class, have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. Everyone knows that without the efforts of the working class, there would be no such tremendous changes. Last year, the pig iron output of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant increased nearly thirteen times compared with 1949, and the coke output increased nearly ten times. All the workers in the plant are proud of their creative labor. In the early days of recovery, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had outdated equipment and frequent accidents. The worker brothers fought resolutely against various difficulties as if they were going to the battlefield. For example, No. 2 blast furnace, a year and a half ago, often burned through due to the old furnace body and could not be used. The workers tried everything possible to maintain it. Sometimes in the middle of winter, they had to crawl into the bottom of the blast furnace to repair it, and their clothes were often frozen into water, shivering with cold, but no one complained; until now, this blast furnace is still continuing to produce.
    The workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery General Factory use every second of time and every piece of material to build a new life for our great motherland. In April this year, Li Huaizhi's blanking team completed its task three days ahead of schedule. Because the new task had not yet been assigned, they took advantage of this gap to produce using scrap iron, first making 10,000 washers, then making 10,000 "L"-shaped screws and 535 weeding hoe handles. Worker Tian Wenzhang found many iron sheets on the scrap iron pile, and he used them to make 50,000 washers. Li Huaizhi said: "We are doing this to greet the first Five-Year Plan with the strength of our workers." Under the encouragement of this patriotic enthusiasm, eighty new records appeared in the whole factory within half a month.
    Construction worker Niu Dekuan, who is building the capital day and night, is a labor model in Beijing. The bricklaying team he leads has been awarded the title of model for its remarkable achievements in learning the "Su Changyou bricklaying method" and the "double-hand mortar squeezing method" for the purpose of building Beijing and building the motherland. But they are not satisfied with this achievement. On the eve of this year's "May Day" Labor Day, they held a team meeting and formulated a plan to challenge Beijing construction workers. The plan is to lay 3,000 bricks per person per day for the foundation, 1,800 bricks below the window, and 1,500 bricks above the window; and to ensure that two batches of apprentices, about ten in each batch, will be trained by the end of the year. They stated that they want to always maintain the glory of the shock team in the ranks of construction workers.
    These and countless other facts make people happy, make people feel proud to be born in our great motherland, and make people feel happy to be born in the Mao Zedong era. Now the first Five-Year Plan of our great motherland has begun, and the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union, which was convened to realize this plan, has also opened. Let us, under the wise and genius leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, build our motherland even more bravely and diligently!

    欢乐的北京
  　本报记者　刘时平　常工
    今年“五一”的北京，比往年更加欢乐。我们进入了计划建设的新时期，工业化的百年大计，正由我们勤劳的双手，在今年开始作起。看看这规模盛大的游行，或者是通宵达旦的歌舞；听听保卫和建设祖国的人们的宣誓，或者是来自世界各国友人的祝贺，它都充分地反映出我们祖国人民保卫祖国和建设祖国的坚强决心，也充分地显示出我们伟大祖国的人民热爱和平与保卫和平的崇高愿望。
    这天的早晨，细雨蒙蒙，但是，它并没有阻止住人们的欢乐。游行队伍从四面八方来到天安门广场，许多人们穿着湿透了的衣服，昂首高歌大踏步地前进；有些来得很早的队伍，围成无数的圆圈，纵情地伴着雨声跳舞；有些少女们和儿童队员们，都用自己的头巾和手帕，蒙着鲜花，包着白鸽，手舞足蹈地狂歌狂舞。上午十点正，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，在“东方红”的嘹亮乐声和歌声中，步上天安门城楼，数十万人都忘记自己置身雨中，大家同时举起红旗，摇动鲜花，“毛主席万岁”“中国共产党万岁”的欢呼声四起，震撼全城。人们的欢乐是不能以言语形容的，因为现实生活已使人们意识到，我们伟大的祖国，正在从胜利走向胜利，还要继续走向更大的胜利。从西郊来的人们，他们可以告诉你，在西直门和复兴门外的原野上，解放前一片荒凉的地方，今天机关和学校的楼房，已经一座接着一座地矗立在天空；东郊工业区也在日新月异，旧有的工厂已能生产最新式的产品，新建的工厂也在陆续开工；有些人们会欢天喜地地说：以前臭水四溢的龙须沟，经久失修的陶然亭，今天已经变成优美的风景区，成为劳动人民休憩的良好境地；今天安定门外的建筑工地上，脚手架子如同树林一般，围绕着地坛密密林立。只要你到城外兜一圈，就可以看到满载着砂石砖瓦的马车和汽车，前呼后拥，在柏油马路上奔驰赛跑。
    北京城内的建设，也是一日千里地进展着。过去人们说北京城最高的房子是北京饭店，去年新建的和平宾馆已经超过了它。今年首都建筑的面积要超过去年两倍，还要向高层发展。就拿市政建设来说吧！原来现吃现卖的北京市公共汽车公司，曾经困难到没有一辆车子，到现在它自己每日已能出车一百五十八辆，礼拜天增加到一百七十辆，一天要把十二万多人输送到城里城外的各个工作、生产岗位上，礼拜天更要把二十多万人送到工人文化宫和北海、天坛、万寿山等风景幽美的地方。
    在这样巨大的变化中，北京的劳动人民，特别是工人阶级，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。谁都知道，没有工人阶级的努力，就没有这些巨大的变化。石景山钢铁厂去年的生铁产量比一九四九年提高了近十三倍，焦炭产量提高了近十倍。全厂工人都为他们的创造性劳动而自豪。在刚恢复的时候，石景山钢铁厂设备陈腐，经常发生事故，工人弟兄们就像是上战场一样，向各种困难展开了坚决的斗争。如二号高炉，在一年半以前，因为炉体陈旧，经常烧穿，不能使用，工人们想尽一切办法来维护它，有时在十冬腊月，还要钻进高炉底下去修理，衣服经常淋结成水，冻得发抖，但没有一个人喊苦；直到现在，这个高炉仍然继续生产着。
    北京农业机械总厂的工人，利用每一秒钟的时间和每一块材料，建设我们伟大祖国的新生活。今年四月间，李怀治下料小组提前三天完成了任务。因为新任务没有下来，他们就藉着这个空隙，利用废铁来生产，第一次制造了一万个垫圈，接着又制造了一万个“L”型螺丝、五百三十五个耘锄犁柄。工人田文章又在废铁堆上发现许多铁片，他就用它作了五万个垫圈。李怀治说：“我们这样干，就是要以我们工人的力量，迎接第一个五年建设计划。”在这种爱国热情的鼓舞下，全厂在半个月内，就出现了八十个新纪录。
    正在日以继夜地建设首都的建筑工人牛德宽，是北京市的劳动模范。他所带领的瓦工小组，为了建设北京，建设祖国，曾因为学习“苏长有砌砖法”、
    “双手挤浆法”获得显著成绩而得到模范称号。但他们并不以这个成绩而满足。今年“五一”劳动节的前夕，他们召开了小组会，拟定了一个向北京建筑工人挑战的计划。这个计划是每天每人砌砖底层是三千块，窗口以下是一千八，窗口以上是一千五；并且保证在年底以前带好两批徒弟，每一批有十个左右。他们表示：他们要在建筑工人队伍中永远保持着突击队的光荣。
    这些以及其他无数的事实，使人们欢乐，使人们因为自己生长在我们伟大祖国而感到骄傲，使人们因为自己生长在毛泽东时代而感到幸福。现在我们伟大祖国的第一个五年建设计划已经开始，为了实现这一计划而召开的中国工会第七次全国代表大会也开幕了。让我们在毛主席和中国共产党的英明的天才的领导下，更加勇敢而勤劳地来建设我们的祖国吧！
