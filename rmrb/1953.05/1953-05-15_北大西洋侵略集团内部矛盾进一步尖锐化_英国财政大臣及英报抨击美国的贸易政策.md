Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: TASS Moscow, May 13th: "Pravda" published an article by P. Yefimov on the 13th, commenting on the speech delivered by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler on May 8th to the French Chamber of Commerce in London.

Yefimov wrote: Foreign newspapers pointed out that Butler chose to deliver his speech at the French Chamber of Commerce in London with a purpose. According to newspaper reports, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer tried to explain that while safeguarding the interests of the British ruling group, he was also defending the interests of other Western European countries. He rightly raised the issue of the dollar shortage as a payment problem between the dollar world and the non-dollar world. The problem is that excessively high U.S. tariffs hinder exports from Britain, France, and other European countries to the United States, making it impossible for them to eliminate their dollar shortage in foreign trade payments. On the other hand, the aforementioned countries' enterprises are restricted by the notorious Battle Act—which shackles European countries already dependent on the United States—from developing trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies.

Yefimov cited facts to prove the dissatisfaction of British business people with U.S. policy. Although Britain has been receiving "U.S. aid" for several years, its economic situation has worsened. As evidenced by the statement made by British Trade Minister Thorneycroft on May 9th, despite Britain's measures to restrict imports, Britain's foreign trade deficit has not decreased. Thorneycroft pointed out that in April, Britain's foreign trade deficit amounted to 70 million pounds. The situation of other Western European countries caught in the vise of "U.S. aid" is similar to that of Britain. Therefore, when Butler spoke at the French Chamber of Commerce, he faced an audience that sympathized with his views. Butler's speech aroused a wide response in Western Europe, apparently because it touched the sore spot in the relationship between those countries and the United States.

Western European countries have demanded that the United States reduce tariffs and tax rates on their exports, but to no avail. On the contrary, in order to protect the interests of powerful monopoly groups, the U.S. Congress is demanding more restrictions on imports, especially on oil, lead, zinc, and other goods. Such a policy seriously hurts the economies of Western European countries. Butler's speech once again shows that resistance to U.S. policy is growing among the masses and in a section of the bourgeoisie. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech and the comments it aroused in Western Europe eloquently demonstrate the further sharpening of contradictions within the "North Atlantic Group."

Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: London dispatch: After British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler delivered a speech criticizing U.S. trade policy at a luncheon of the British French Chamber of Commerce on May 8th, the newspapers of the British bourgeoisie echoed and criticized the United States.

"The Observer" described Butler's words as a "straightforward warning" to the United States, and said, "We hope Washington will not ignore his warning, and that the U.S. authorities responsible will act in time to stop and reverse the economically isolationist tendencies with unfortunate consequences... Butler clearly stated that he will adhere to his policy and does not intend to give up and retreat all at once." The newspaper believes that Butler should have been more "clear" in his speech and should have told the Americans that Britain's "countermeasures are ready."

"The Sunday Express" said: "American policy is too often harmful to Britain." The newspaper mentioned the divisions between the "English-speaking allies" and said: "Divisions do exist, and the existence of such divisions cannot be concealed." The newspaper advocated that "when careful study of the various practical situations shows that taking an independent approach is most sufficient to ensure the interests of the British Empire, Britain must be increasingly prepared to take such an independent approach."

"The Empire News" said: "A behind-the-scenes struggle of 'economics' and 'politics' is underway. Butler believes that, whatever the cost, export trade must be maintained, and if the United States is unwilling to cooperate, then Britain and the Commonwealth must go elsewhere."

### 北大西洋侵略集团内部矛盾进一步尖锐化  英国财政大臣及英报抨击美国的贸易政策

    北大西洋侵略集团内部矛盾进一步尖锐化
    英国财政大臣及英报抨击美国的贸易政策
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：“真理报”十三日登载了普·叶菲莫夫的一篇论文，评论英国财政大臣巴特勒五月八日在伦敦法商商会发表的演说。
    叶菲莫夫写道：外国报刊指出，巴特勒选择在伦敦的法商商会来发表演说是有目的的。据报纸报道，英国财政大臣力图说明，他在维护英国统治集团的利益时，同时也是在保卫西欧其他各国的利益。他把缺少美元的问题作为美元世界与非美元世界之间的支付问题提出是有道理的。问题是：美国过高的关税妨碍英、法和其他欧洲国家对美国的出口，使它们不可能消除它们在对外贸易支付上的美元短缺。另一方面，上述各国的企业公司被臭名昭著的巴特尔法案——该法案束缚着已经依附美国的欧洲国家——所限制，不得发展与苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的贸易。
    叶菲莫夫列举事实证明英国商界人士对美国政策的不满。虽然英国好几年来一直在接受“美援”，但它的经济情况却越来越糟。如英国贸易大臣桑尼克罗夫特于五月九日发表的声明所证明的，尽管英国采取了限制进口的措施，英国的对外贸易逆差仍然没有减少。桑尼克罗夫特指出：四月份英国对外贸易的逆差数达七千万英镑。被夹在“美援”的老虎钳子中的其他西欧国家的情况与英国相似。所以，当巴特勒在法商商会演说时，他所面对的是同情他的观点的听众。巴特勒的演说在西欧引起广泛的响应，显然是因为这篇演说正触到了那些国家和美国关系上的痛处。
    西欧各国要求美国减低对它们的出口货的关税和税率，但毫无结果。相反地，为了保护有势力的垄断集团的利益，美国国会正要求对进口货规定更多的限制，特别对石油、铅、锌和其他货物。这样的政策严重地打击了西欧国家的经济。巴特勒的演说再一次显示，对美国政策的反抗，在人民大众方面和某一部分资产阶级中正在增长。英国财政大臣的演说和这个演说在西欧所引起的评论，雄辩地证明了“北大西洋集团”内部矛盾进一步的尖锐化。
    【新华社十四日讯】伦敦消息：英国财政大臣巴特勒五月八日在英国法商商会午餐会上发表不满美国贸易政策的演说后，英国资产阶级的报纸纷纷呼应，抨击美国。
    “观察家报”形容巴特勒的话为对美国的“单刀直入的警告”，并说，“我们希望华盛顿不要不理会他的警告，而且美国负责当局能及时动作起来，制止并扭转有不幸后果的经济孤立主义倾向……巴特勒清楚地表示了他要坚持他的政策，而且不打算一下子就认输而偃旗息鼓。”该报认为，巴特勒在他的演说中还应该表示得更加“明白”，应当告诉美国人，英国的“对策已经准备好了”。
    “星期日快报”说：“美国的政策过于经常地对英国有害。”该报提到“英语盟国”之间的分歧时说：“分歧的确存在，而且不能掩饰这种分歧的存在。”该报主张，“当慎重研究了各种实际情况之后，认为采取独立的方针最足以保证英帝国的利益时，英国一定要越加准备采取这种独立的方针。”
    “帝国新闻报”说：“‘经济’和‘政治’的幕后斗争正在进行。巴特勒认为，无论代价如何，出口贸易必须维持，如果美国不愿合作，那末英国和联邦就必须走向别方面去。”
