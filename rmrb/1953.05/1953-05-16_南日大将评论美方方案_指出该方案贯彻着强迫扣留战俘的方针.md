Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 15th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Korean and Chinese delegation released a communique on May 15th as follows:
    At the plenary session of both delegations on May 15, our chief representative General Nam Il comprehensively commented on the opposing side's proposal of May 13, pointing out that the proposal, in its main provisions, implemented the opposing side's basic policy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, which our side resolutely cannot agree to. The opposing side's claim to "release on the spot" the non-directly repatriated Korean prisoners of war within the area under the opposing side's control directly violates the current negotiation basis already agreed upon by both sides, that is, to transfer the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to a neutral nations organization. General Nam Il stated: Our side has consistently advocated resolving the issue through negotiation on a reasonable basis agreed upon by both sides, and has made multiple major efforts, successively putting forward two specific implementation plans. The problem now is that the opposing side is attempting to overturn this basis, advocating directly and indirectly forcibly detaining our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated, which our side naturally cannot agree to.
    The opposing side made some defenses at the meeting regarding some detailed issues in their proposal, but was unable to defend its unreasonable stance on the main issues. General Nam Il requested the opposing side to reconsider its position, so that both delegations could quickly pass our side's May 7th proposal and enter into concrete discussions, in order to achieve a Korean armistice.
    Both sides are scheduled to continue holding a plenary session of both delegations at 11:00 a.m. on May 16th.
    The full text of General Nam Il's main speech at the May 15th meeting is as follows:
    "Yesterday, I presented a preliminary comment on your proposal, pointing out that the basic policy contained in the main provisions of your proposal is to use force to obstruct repatriation and implement the policy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Therefore, our side resolutely cannot agree. You cannot offer any tenable reasons for this comment of mine, but instead resort to means of rumor-mongering and slander. Your attitude does not help the progress of the negotiations in the slightest, it was like this in the past, and it remains so now. For the progress of the negotiations, we hope that you will abandon this attitude that is not helpful to the negotiations.
    In order to eliminate the long-term differences between the two sides on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation and to achieve a Korean armistice, our side suggested that the repatriation of prisoners of war be carried out in two steps, transferring the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice to neutral countries in order to seek a fair resolution to their repatriation issue. Negotiations were resumed on this basis.
    Your side has stated more than once that you agree with this principle in our side's proposal. In your letter to me on April 16th, you suggested 'releasing prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral countries for accommodation in Korea'. Since then, after the resumption of the plenary session, your side has expressed agreement with this basic suggestion of our side at almost every meeting. In fact, even in the speech on the same day that you presented your proposal, you mentioned this basic suggestion with agreement. However, your proposal surprisingly suggests 'releasing on the spot' our Korean captured personnel who are not directly repatriated after the armistice, in your area, implementing forced detention on them. All the excuses you have put forward cannot justify your self-contradictory position. We believe that such fickle and blatantly self-contradictory situations are not allowed in our negotiations. Your suggestion not only contradicts our side's basic suggestion that you once agreed to and still claim to agree to, but also threatens the basis of current negotiations. Your attempt to use this method to forcibly detain more than two-thirds of our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated is absolutely impossible.
    Regarding our captured personnel who are not of Korean nationality who are not directly repatriated, your side claims to have adopted some of the specific methods proposed in our side's May 7th proposal. But even for these non-Korean captured personnel, the basic policy contained in the main provisions of your proposal has no similarity to the spirit of our side's May 7th proposal. Long before our side attempted to accommodate your premise of leaving the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea and put forward our May 7th proposal, we repeatedly stated that in order to implement the basic suggestion agreed upon by both sides to transfer the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral countries in order to seek a fair resolution to their repatriation issue, steps must be taken to enable these prisoners of war to be free from the military control and influence of the detaining party, under the supervision of a neutral organization that effectively exercises its legitimate authority, allowing the relevant party to have full freedom and convenience to explain to them, so that they can make requests to return to their home country without any coercion. We believe that such handling is completely fair. Although your proposal formally adopts some specific arrangements in our proposal, its basic policy is completely contrary to the spirit of our proposal. Your side claims to agree in principle to the composition of the neutral nations repatriation committee proposed by our side, but in specific provisions, it imposes various unreasonable restrictions on the neutral countries under the pretext of administrative difficulties, only allowing one neutral country to be equipped with armed forces and staff, and only agreeing to each of the other neutral countries sending one representative, whose staff assistants do not exceed ten people. This makes it impossible for this organization to exercise its legitimate authority, and it has to rely on the strength of the detaining party. And your proposal makes exactly such provisions, with the detaining party providing 'administrative and security forces' and unarmed personnel.
    Your proposal also stipulates that, except for procedural matters, this organization and its affiliated institutions must conduct daily work on the basis of unanimous agreement. This makes it impossible for it and its affiliated institutions to smoothly resolve any issue that may arise. It is clear that the purpose you are pursuing is to make this institution unable to perform any function other than assisting you in implementing forced detention.
    Your side claims to agree to the provision that the relevant party explain to its captured personnel under the supervision of the neutral nations repatriation committee, but in specific arrangements, your side adds various unreasonable restrictions to the explanation work and the personnel conducting the explanation. Under the supervision of the neutral nations organization agreed upon by both sides, there is no question of using force against prisoners of war at all; allowing the relevant party full freedom and convenience to conduct explanation work by the neutral nations organization will not give rise to the fundamental and untenable issue of so-called forced repatriation; explaining to prisoners of war that they have the full right to return home to live a peaceful life will not create any coercion. But you said on May 14 that restricting explanation is to prevent prisoners of war from being coerced. From this, it can be seen that you regard letting prisoners of war know that they have the right to return to their hometowns to live a peaceful life as a kind of coercion. The purpose of setting out these various restrictions is to preserve the fears of our captured personnel, so that they cannot return to their hometowns and suffer your forced detention.
    After such supervision and such explanation, after an unreasonable two-month limit, you suggest 'releasing on the spot' our captured personnel who have not yet requested repatriation in your area. Releasing on the spot in the area of the detaining party is forced detention in disguise. Your side claims that this provision of yours is a final resolution provision, but in fact it is a forced detention provision, which our side resolutely cannot agree to. Our side maintains that if, after a reasonable period, there are still prisoners of war who have not requested repatriation after being explained to, the issue of their treatment is part of the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue after the armistice, and should be submitted to a higher-level political conference for resolution; and the higher-level political conference is fully capable of reasonably resolving this issue under the circumstances after the armistice.
    According to your proposal, more than two-thirds of our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated will be directly forcibly detained by your side. The other less than one-third of our captured personnel will be placed under the supervision of a neutral nations organization and its affiliated institutions that cannot legally exercise their powers. Among those supervising them are your security forces, administrative personnel, and staff. They will not receive sufficient explanation from the personnel of their side. If they request repatriation, their request may be rejected according to your regulations due to your direct obstruction and the failure of the neutral nations organization to reach a consensus. Even if they are not rejected, they can only be sent to the demilitarized zone under the so-called escort of your armed personnel. If they cannot make their request due to the layers of restrictions, they will be forcibly detained by your side under the name of being released after a two-month period. Therefore, the main points of your proposal mentioned above, which you plan to apply to less than one-third of our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated, still contain a basic policy of forced detention.
    You said on May 13 that your proposal adopts the main parts of our May 7th proposal, which is not in line with the facts. It is true that some specific provisions of your proposal formally adopt some provisions of our proposal; we have also said that some specific provisions of your proposal are not without places that can be adopted. But all these specific details are subordinate to the basic policy of forced detention contained in the main provisions of your proposal.
    The basic spirit of our May 7th proposal is to enable all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to be free from the military control and influence of the detaining party, based on the common basis agreed upon by both sides, to place them under the supervision of an effective neutral nations repatriation committee, and to allow them to gladly return to their hometowns after the explanation of the relevant party. But the basic policy of your proposal is to overturn the common basis agreed upon by both sides, directly forcibly detaining most of our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated, and placing the remaining part of our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated, together with the affiliated institutions and personnel of that neutral nations repatriation committee that actually supervises the prisoners of war, under your military control and intervention, using the excuse of preventing non-existent oppression, obstructing the relevant party from conducting explanations in various ways, making it impossible for most prisoners of war to request repatriation, and finally being forcibly detained by your side under the name of release on the spot. You repeatedly claim to oppose using force to obstruct repatriation, but your proposal is precisely to achieve the purpose of using force to obstruct repatriation.
    You said on May 14 that on major issues, our side seems to be unwilling to reach an agreement on any conditions other than our own conditions. If your words mean that our side is unwilling to negotiate with your side on a reasonable basis, then I must point out that your statement is unfounded. Facts speak louder than words. Our side has consistently advocated conducting consultations on a reasonable basis agreed upon by both sides to seek a solution to the problem. Since the resumption of the meeting, our side has made multiple major efforts to reasonably resolve the problem. This is obvious to all. The problem now is that your side is attempting to overturn this reasonable basis that has been agreed upon by both sides, advocating directly and indirectly forcibly detaining our captured personnel who are not directly repatriated, which we resolutely cannot agree to.
    Consultations must be conducted on a reasonable basis agreed upon by both sides. On a reasonable basis agreed upon by both sides, our side has put forward two specific implementation plans. We suggest passing our May 7th proposal in order to enter into specific discussions."

    南日大将评论美方方案
    指出该方案贯彻着强迫扣留战俘的方针
    【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月十五日发表公报如下：
    在五月十五日的双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日大将全面评论了对方五月十三日的方案。指出该方案在主要规定上，都贯彻着对方强迫扣留战俘的基本方针，而这是我方所坚决不能同意的。对方所提出的将不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘，在对方控制下的地区内“就地释放”的主张，更直接违反了双方业已同意的将不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国机构的目前谈判基础。南日大将表示：我方一贯主张在双方同意的合理基础上协商解决问题，并已作了多次重大的努力，先后提出了两个具体实施方案。现在的问题是：对方企图推翻这一基础，主张直接地和变相地强迫扣留不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，我方自然不能同意。
    对方在会上对其方案中的一些细节问题进行了辩解，但无法辩护其在主要问题上的无理立场。南日大将要求对方重新考虑对方的立场，俾双方代表团能迅速通过我方五月七日方案，并进入具体的讨论，以实现朝鲜停战。
    双方定于五月十六日上午十一时继续举行双方代表团大会。
    南日大将在五月十五日会上的主要发言全文如下：
    “昨天我提出了对你们方案的初步评论，指出你方方案在主要规定上所包含的基本方针，是用武力阻挠遣返，贯彻强迫扣留战俘的方针，因此，我方坚决不能同意。对于我的这个评论，你方提不出任何站得住的辩解的理由，却诉诸造谣、诬蔑的手段。你方这种态度丝毫无助于谈判的进展，过去如此，现在仍然如此。为了谈判的进展，我们希望你方放弃这种无助于谈判的态度。
    为了消除双方在战俘遣返问题上的长期的分歧，实现朝鲜停战，我方建议将战俘的遣返分成两个步骤来进行，将停战后不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国，以便对他们的遣返问题求得公正的解决，谈判是在这个基础上恢复的。
    你方曾不止一次地表示同意我方建议中的这个原则。四月十六日你在给我的信上就曾建议过‘未被直接遣返的战俘释交中立国在朝鲜收容’。此后大会复会，几乎在每一次会上你方都曾表示过对于我方这一基本建议的同意。事实上，就是在你方提出方案的同一天的发言里，你也同意地提到过这个基本建议。但你方方案竟然建议将停战后不直接遣返的我方朝鲜籍被俘人员，在你方地区内‘就地释放’，对他们实行强迫扣留。你方所提出的一切借口都不能辩解你方这个自相矛盾的立场。我们以为在我们这个谈判里，不容许有这样出尔反尔、公然自相矛盾的情况。你方这个建议不仅和你方曾经同意而现在仍然自称同意的我方基本建议相矛盾，而且威胁现行谈判的基础。你方企图用这个办法来强迫扣留三分之二以上不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，这是绝对办不到的。
    对于非朝鲜籍的不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，你方声称采用了我方五月七日方案中所提出的一些具体办法。但是即便对于这些非朝鲜籍的我方被俘人员，你方方案主要规定上所包含的基本方针，也和我方五月七日方案的精神没有相同之处。远在我方试图迁就你方将不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜的前提，提出我方五月七日方案之前，我们就一再表示：为了实施双方所同意的将不直接遣返的战俘转交中立国，以便对他们的遣返问题求得公正解决的基本建议，必须采取步骤使这些战俘能够脱离拘留一方的军事控制和影响，在一个有效行使其合法职权的中立机构的看管之下，让有关一方具有充分的自由与便利向他们进行解释，以便他们在不受任何强迫的情况下，得以提出返回祖国的要求。我们认为这样的处理是完全公正的。你方方案虽然在形式上采纳了我方方案中的若干具体安排，但其基本方针却是和我方方案的精神完全背道而驰的。你方声称原则上同意我方所提出的中立国遣返委员会的组成，但在具体规定上却以行政困难为理由对中立国多方加以限制，只允许一个中立国家配备武装力量和工作人员，对其他中立国家只同意他们各派一个代表，其参谋助理人员不超过十人。这就使得这个机构无法行使其合法职权，而不得不借助于拘留一方的力量。而你方方案却正是作了这样的规定，由拘留一方提供‘行政和保安部队’和非武装的工作人员。
    你方方案并规定：除程序问题外，这个组织及其附属机构必须在一致同意的基础上进行日常工作。这就使得它和其附属机构不能顺利解决任何一个可能发生争执的问题。很显然，使这个机构不能发生除去协助你方实行强迫扣留以外其他任何作用，正是你方所追求的目的。
    你方声称同意有关一方向其在中立国遣返委员会看管下的被俘人员进行解释的规定，但在具体安排上，你方却对解释工作及进行解释的人员加上各种无理限制。在双方同意的中立国组织的看管之下，对战俘根本就没有使用武力的问题；由中立国组织进行安排使有关一方有充分的自由和便利进行解释工作，就更不会产生所谓强迫遣返的根本不能成立的问题；向战俘解释他们有回家过和平生活的完全权利，决不会产生任何胁迫。但你方在五月十四日竟然说限制解释，是为了防止战俘遭受胁迫。由此可见：你们是把让战俘知道他们有权返回家乡过和平生活当作一种胁迫。你方订出这种种限制的目的，是为了保留我方被俘人员的疑惧，使他们不能返回家乡而遭受你方的强迫扣留。
    经过这样的看管和这样的解释，在不合理的两个月限制之后，你方建议将尚未请求遣返的我方被俘人员，在你方地区‘就地释放’。在拘留一方的地区内就地释放，就是变相的强迫扣留。你方号称你们这个规定是一个最后解决的规定，但其实却是强迫扣留的规定，我方坚决不能同意。我方主张：如果经过合理的期限后，还有经过解释而仍未请求遣返的战俘，关于他们的处理问题，是停战后和平解决朝鲜问题的一部分，应该提交高一级政治会议解决；而高一级的政治会议在停战后的情况下，是完全能够合理解决这个问题的。
    根据你方方案，三分之二以上的不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，将被你方直接地强迫扣留。而其他的不到三分之一的我方被俘人员，则被置于一个不能合法行使职权的中立国组织及其附属机构的看管之下。看管他们的有你方的保安部队、行政人员和工作人员在内。他们得不到他们所属一方人员的充分解释，他们如果请求遣返，则根据你方的规定，可能因你方的直接阻挠和中立国组织的不能取得一致而遭受否决。即便不遭受否决，他们又只得在你方武装人员的所谓护送之下，才能被送到非军事区。如果他们由于层层的限制而不能提出他们的请求，则他们将在两个月的期限之后，在被释放的名义之下，被你方强迫扣留。因此，你方准备对于不到三分之一的不直接遣返的我方被俘人员所施用的你方方案上述主要之点，所包含的基本方针仍然是一个强迫扣留。
    你在五月十三日说：你方方案采纳了我方五月七日方案的主要部分，这是与事实不符的。诚然，你方方案的某一些具体规定，在形式上采纳了我方方案的若干规定；我们也曾说过：你方方案的某些具体规定不是没有可以采用的地方。但所有这些具体细节，是从属于你方方案的主要规定所包含的强迫扣留的基本方针的。
    我方五月七日方案的基本精神，是根据双方同意的共同基础，使所有不直接遣返的战俘脱离拘留一方的军事控制和影响，将他们置于一个有效的中立国遣返委员会的看管之下，经过有关一方的解释，使他们欣然返回家乡。但你方方案的基本方针，却是推翻双方同意的共同基础，直接强迫扣留了大部分不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，而将其余部分的不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，连同那个实际看管战俘的中立国遣返委员会的附属机构与工作人员，一起置于你方的军事控制和干预之下，借口防止根本不存在的压迫，多方阻挠有关一方的进行解释，使大多数战俘不能请求遣返，而最后则在就地释放的名义之下被你方强迫扣留。你方口口声声自称反对用武力阻挠遣返，但你方方案却正是要实现武力阻挠遣返的目的。
    你在五月十四日说：在主要问题上，我方似不准备在我方自己条件以外的任何其他条件上达成协议。如果你方这句话是指我方不准备在合理的基础上和你方进行协商，那么，我必须指出：你方这样说是没有根据的。实际胜于雄辩。我方一贯主张在双方同意的合理基础上进行协商，求得问题的解决。复会以来，我方为合理解决问题已作了多次重大努力。这是有目共睹的。现在的问题是你方企图推翻这个双方已经同意的合理基础，主张直接地和间接地强迫扣留不直接遣返的我方被俘人员，这是我们所坚决不能同意的。
    协商必须在双方同意的合理基础上进行。在双方同意的合理基础上，我方已经提出了两个具体实施方案。我们建议通过我方五月七日方案，以便进入具体讨论。”
