Xinhua News Agency, London, May 18th: The British National Peace Action Conference grandly opened in Manchester on May 17th.

The conference hall was decorated with the flags of Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries, peace emblems, and slogans calling for the struggle for peace and opposition to another war—one of which read: "Negotiate, Don't War!"

Over a thousand delegates and guests from across the country attended the conference. The presidium of the conference included many well-known peace fighters—Mrs. Monica Felton, recipient of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, Ivor Montagu, Secretary of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, Dennis Nowell Pritt, a prominent progressive lawyer, Gordon Schaffer, a progressive journalist, Belcher, General Secretary of the Tobacco Workers' Union, Professor Bernal, a renowned scientist, and others.

The delegates attending the conference held various political and religious beliefs, representing different trade unions, local peace committees, as well as many other public organizations such as youth, women, culture, and religion. Among the delegates were members of the Communist Party, members of the Labour and Co-operative Parties, business people, farmers, housewives, and monks.

The National Union of Mineworkers, the largest trade union in the country, and the local workshop representative committees and branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union sent more than two hundred delegates to the conference. Local peace committees also had more than two hundred delegates participating in the conference. There were many women delegates at the conference, with the National Women's Assembly alone sending two hundred delegates.

One delegation was composed of the wives and mothers of prisoners of war captured in Korea. They came to the conference to demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea and the early repatriation of prisoners of war.

The conference was opened by Pritt. Speakers at the morning session expressed their willingness to actively work for the cause of peace and do their best to avoid another war. They called for an immediate meeting of the leaders of the great powers to end the "Cold War" and establish lasting peace throughout the world. The conference strongly demanded an immediate peace in Korea and an end to the wars in Vietnam and Malaya.
