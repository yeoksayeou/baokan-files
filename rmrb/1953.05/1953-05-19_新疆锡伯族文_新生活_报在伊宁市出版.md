    The Xinjiang Xibe-language "New Life" newspaper is published in Yining City
    The "New Life" newspaper, printed in the Xibe language, was published in Yining City, Xinjiang on May 1st. This is a major event in the cultural life of the people of this ethnic group.
    The Xibe are a minority ethnic group in Xinjiang Province, with a population of approximately 12,000, mainly living in Ningxi County on the south bank of the Ili River. In the past, they only had a mimeographed newsletter published every three days, with simple content and blurry printing. In order to help the Xibe people develop their cultural and educational undertakings, the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government purchased printing presses, type-casting machines, copper molds and other printing materials last year and donated them to the Xibe people. After these printing materials were transported to Yining City, an important town in the western frontier of the motherland, the newspaper office, with the help of local Party and government organizations, completed preparatory work such as type-casting and training typesetters, and officially published the "New Life" newspaper on May 1st.
    The "New Life" newspaper is a three-day publication with four pages in broadsheet format.

    新疆锡伯族文“新生活”报在伊宁市出版
    用锡伯族文字铅印的“新生活”报，五月一日在新疆伊宁市出版。这是该族人民文化生活中一件大喜事。
    锡伯族是新疆省的一个少数民族，人口约一万二千人，主要聚居在伊犁河南岸的宁西县。他们过去只有一种油印小报，三日一期，内容简单，印刷也较模糊，为帮助锡伯族人民发展文化教育事业，中央人民政府民族事务委员会在去年购置了印刷机、铸字机、铜模等印刷材料，赠送给锡伯族人民。这些印刷材料运送到祖国西陲重镇伊宁市后，该报社在当地党、政机关帮助下，经过铸字、训练排字工人等准备工作，在五月一日正式出版“新生活”报。
    “新生活”报为四开四版的三日刊。
