Xinhua News Agency, 9th: World opinion generally believes that the eight-point proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side to clear the obstacles to the armistice has paved the way for the realization of the Korean armistice.

A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 7th that the new proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side was an "important development." The "Daily Express" wrote on the 8th with the title "Korea - New Hope for Peace": "Achieving peace in Korea is more likely tonight than at any time since the war began nearly three years ago." The "Times" said, "The Communist action greatly helps to confirm the view that they now genuinely hope to end the Korean War."

Indian political figures believe that the new proposal of the Korean-Chinese side is a very important suggestion for resolving the Korean stalemate.

Many newspapers in Switzerland published this news with large headlines. The "Berner Tagblatt" published a large headline at the top of the newspaper: "Paving the Way for the Korean Armistice," and published the news under the title "Communist Determination in Korean Armistice Agreement."

The Dutch "Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant" welcomed the new proposal of the Korean-Chinese side, believing that it was "another step forward."

The American "Herald Tribune" published an editorial on the 8th, believing that on the basis of the new proposal of the Korean-Chinese side, the Korean armistice should be achievable. The Associated Press commented on the new proposal, saying, "The Communist proposal opens a new path for the long-stalled issue of prisoner of war exchange." United Press also said, "It seems that this is the time with the greatest hope for peace since the beginning of the Korean War."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: This agency's special correspondent reports: After a day of recess, Harrison, the chief representative of the U.S. side, raised a series of questions about the new proposal put forward by General Nam Il - a proposal that is hailed by peace-loving people all over the world as being of decisive importance in achieving the Korean armistice. If the U.S. negotiating representatives did not intentionally raise minor issues to delay the Korean armistice, the new eight-point proposal would have provided a complete and reasonable solution to the issue of repatriating prisoners of war.

The questions raised by Harrison are mostly details, such as how the five neutral countries will guard the prisoners of war in the POW camps, as well as language and supply issues. His first question was to bring out the U.S. side's old excuse, saying that holding a higher-level political conference to resolve the final disposition of prisoners of war is tantamount to "forcing" and "indefinitely detaining" prisoners of war.

General Nam Il's six-point and eight-point proposals are actually intended to liberate prisoners of war from the coercion of the detaining party, and give them the opportunity to escape indefinite detention and exile. As General Nam Il said, these two proposals "best embody the principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention and international practice," so that all prisoners of war can be repatriated after the armistice.

The records of the delegation's conference show that the U.S. side's obstruction and opposition are to prevent prisoners of war from returning home quickly, and to allow them to be exiled abroad indefinitely.

In order to achieve the Korean armistice as soon as possible, the Korean-Chinese representatives have removed all the U.S. side's excuses for delaying the agreement in their recently proposed eight-point proposal. For a year, because the U.S. side has refused to abide by the Geneva Convention and international practice on the repatriation of all prisoners of war, the prisoners of war on both sides cannot return home quickly, and the Korean armistice cannot be achieved quickly. Now the so-called excuse of "no forced repatriation" has been removed, and people will never allow the armistice negotiations to be delayed on the unfounded issue of "indefinite detention." Up to now, Harrison has only raised objections to obstruct a complete agreement on the issue of prisoners of war, while the Korean-Chinese representatives have made every effort to promote a speedy armistice. All peace-loving people are waiting for the U.S. side to show whether they are sincere in achieving the Korean armistice.

    世界舆论欢迎我方解决战俘问题的新方案
    美方提出一大串枝节问题阻挠关于战俘问题的协议
    【新华社九日讯】世界舆论普遍认为：朝中方面为扫清停战障碍而提出的八点方案，铺平了实现朝鲜停战的道路。
    英国外交部发言人在七日说，朝中方面提出新方案是一个“重要的发展”。“每日快报”在八日以“朝鲜——新的和平希望”为题写道：“在朝鲜实现和平一事，今晚是比战争开始将近三年来的任何时候都更为可能了。”“泰晤士报”说，“共产党的行动对于证实这样一种观点大有帮助，即他们现在真正希望结束朝鲜战争。”
    印度的政界人士认为朝中方面的新方案是解决朝鲜僵局的非常重要的建议。
    瑞士的许多报纸都用大字标题刊登这个消息。“伯尔尼日报”在报头上刊登大标题：“铺平朝鲜停战的道路”，并在“共产党人在朝鲜停战的协议决心”的标题下刊登了消息。
    荷兰的“新鹿特丹报”欢迎朝中方面的新方案，认为这是“又向前迈进了一步”。
    美国的“先驱论坛报”在八日发表社论，认为在朝中方面新方案的基础上，朝鲜的停战应当是可以实现的。美联社在评论这个新方案时说，“共方的建议为拖了很久的关于交换战俘问题的僵局开辟了一条新的道路。”合众社也说，“看来这是朝鲜战争开始以来和平希望最大的时候。” 【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者报道：经过一天的休会以后，美方首席代表哈利逊对南日大将所提出的新的方案——被全世界爱好和平的人们称为在实现朝鲜停战方面具有决定性的重要意义的方案，提出了一大串问题。如果美方谈判代表不是有意提出枝节问题来拖延朝鲜停战，新的八点方案已经提供了完全而合理的解决遣返战俘问题的办法。
    哈利逊提出的问题多半是细节问题，如五个中立国如何在战俘营中看管战俘问题以及语言和供应问题。他的第一个问题是搬出了美方的老一套的借口，说举行高一级的政治会议来解决对战俘的最后处理的问题，等于“逼迫”和“无限期拘留”战俘。
    南日将军的六点方案和八点方案实际上正是为了使战俘能够从拘留一方的逼迫下解放出来，让他们有机会摆脱无限期拘留和流亡的命运。正如南日将军所说的，这两个方案“最能体现一九四九年日内瓦公约原则和国际惯例”，使全部战俘在停战以后都能被遣返。
    代表团大会的记录表明，美方的阻挠和反对是为了阻止战俘迅速回家，而让他们无限期地流亡国外。
    为了早日实现朝鲜停战，朝中代表在他们最近提出的八点方案中，已经解除了美方拖延协议的一切借口。一年以来，由于美方一直拒绝遵守日内瓦公约和关于遣返全部战俘的国际惯例，双方战俘不能迅速回家，朝鲜停战不能迅速实现。现在所谓“不得强迫遣返”的借口已被解除了，人们绝不容许停战谈判在莫须有的“无限期拘留”的问题上拖下去。到现在为止，哈利逊只是一味提出反对意见来阻挠关于战俘问题的完全协议，而朝中代表却尽了一切努力以促成迅速的停战。一切爱好和平的人们都在等待美方表明他们究竟有没有实现朝鲜停战的诚意。
