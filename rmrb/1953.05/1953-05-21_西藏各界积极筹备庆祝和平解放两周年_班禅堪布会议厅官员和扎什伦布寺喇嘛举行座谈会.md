Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 20th: All sectors of Tibet, including the local government of Tibet, the monastic and lay people of Tibet, and all organs and troops under the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are actively preparing for the celebration of the second anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet on May 23rd. Preparatory committees for celebrating the second anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet have been established in major towns such as Lhasa, Shigatse, Qamdo, Gyantse, Heihe, Phari, and Yadong. The Lhasa Municipal Preparatory Committee held its first meeting on the 12th, deciding to hold a celebration meeting on the 23rd, and to convene symposiums for Tibetan local government officials, Tibetan cultural figures, and youth and women from all walks of life from the 20th to the 24th. All organs and troops under the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have begun to review the implementation of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet over the past two years, in order to further understand the spirit of the agreement, unite the Tibetan monastic and lay people, and work together for the thorough implementation of the agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 20th: Principal responsible officials of the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall and responsible Lamas of Tashilhunpo Monastery held a symposium on May 9th to celebrate the second anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. At the meeting, Zasa Jizinmei of the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall spoke first, saying: "It has been nearly two years since the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people returned to the big family of the motherland. In the past two years, all the monastic and lay people of Tibet have deeply realized the greatness of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government's policy of equality among nationalities. The unity between the Tibetan nationality and the fraternal nationalities of the motherland has become increasingly consolidated, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the Tibetan people has been rising day by day. Since the close meeting between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, the Tibetan nationality has also been closely united internally. In this way, the imperialists' conspiracy of aggression has definitely failed." Those who spoke afterward included Grand Lama Wang Lejie, Taiji (Mongolian official title in the Rear Tibet, fourth rank) Delai Raodeng, Renxi (fourth-rank official) Tuanzhukangsa, and others. They all spoke in great detail about the actual benefits that the Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have given to people of all strata by issuing agricultural loans, handicraft loans, purchasing wool, providing medical treatment for the people, and running schools, and described the close relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the local monastic and lay people.

In their speeches, the Lamas especially praised the Central People's Government's policy of freedom of religious belief. Panchen's Deputy Sutra Teacher, Kachen Loji Nyima, expressed his feelings, saying: "Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Lamas have been particularly happy because all the monasteries in Tibet have been effectively protected, and the two precious Buddhas, in whom the Tibetan people have devout faith, have reunited amicably." Khenpo Anqin Living Buddha of Abaza Tsang of Tashilhunpo Monastery and the Khenpos and Living Buddhas of Tuosanglin Tsang, Jikang Tsang, and Xiazai Tsang also participated in the discussion of this issue. They unanimously believed that in the future, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's national policy and policy of freedom of religious belief, and under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, the patriotic thinking of all the Lamas in Tibet will be enhanced day by day. In their speeches, the participating officials and Lamas all expressed their willingness to further strive to implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in the future and their heartfelt support and gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government.
