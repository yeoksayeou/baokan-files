    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Pays Attention to Solving Welfare Problems for Female Workers
    A letter from the Supervisory Office of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant: The number of female workers in our plant began to increase substantially in the second half of 1952, and as a result, welfare issues related to female workers suddenly became serious. Regarding the several welfare problems urgently requiring resolution for female workers in our plant, which were published in the "Reader's Letters Digest" column of the People's Daily on March 4th, our solutions are as follows:
    1. Infant care issue: After resolution by the Workers' Representative Assembly, a portion of the dormitory will be vacated, slightly renovated, and simple equipment added to establish a nursery; the expenses will be covered by the factory director's fund. Our plant has also sent twelve female comrades to study at the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau's childcare training class. We strive to start accepting infants in July. The factory has also decided that female workers with infants under one and a half years old do not have to participate in collective study in the morning and can study on their own at home; they can leave work half an hour earlier in the morning and afternoon; except for Party and League days, they do not have to participate in other extracurricular activities; wages will be paid as usual.
    2. Care for female workers during pregnancy and menstruation: Pregnant female workers will be transferred to live inside the factory as much as possible. When six months pregnant, they can be appropriately transferred to lighter work, and wages will be paid as usual; they will return to their original work after giving birth. The Workers' Representative Assembly also resolved that female workers doing heavy work can switch to lighter work during menstruation, and a female work group leader has been designated to take charge of this matter.
    3. The women's bathhouse has been decided to be built and will start construction soon; the expenses will be covered by the factory director's fund. The problem of the lack of women's toilets has also been resolved.

    石景山钢铁厂已注意解决女工福利问题
    石景山钢铁厂监察室来信：我厂女职工人数在一九五二年下半年开始大量增加，因此有关女职工的福利问题也就骤然严重起来。三月四日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏发表的我厂女职工迫切要求解决的几项福利问题，我们的解决办法如下：
    一，婴儿抚育问题：经职工代表会决议，腾出一部分宿舍略加修缮，并添置简单设备，成立托儿站；经费由厂长基金开支。我厂并已派十二名女同志到北京市民政局保育训练班学习。争取在七月份开始收托婴儿。厂方并已决定：携有一周岁半以下乳儿的女职工早晨可不参加集体学习，在家自学；上下午可各提前半小时下班；除党团日外，可不参加其它业余活动；工资照发。
    二，对女职工怀孕期和经期的照顾问题：怀孕的女职工尽可能调住厂内，怀孕六月时可适当调换较轻工作，工资照发；生育后恢复原来工作。职工代表会并决议，做重活的女工在经期可以改做较轻工作，已指定一女工组长专管此事。
    三，女工浴室已决定修建，不日即可开工；经费由厂长基金开支。女厕所缺少的问题亦已设法解决。
