Effective Methods to Overcome the Disconnection Between Commodity Supply and Sales
Li Ruxiu, Manager of China General Merchandise Company

In the period from October to December 1952, the state-owned department store system mobilized the broad masses, exposed shortcomings in its work, criticized the supply system's operating philosophy of not meticulously accounting and being irresponsible, criticized the employee mentality of "waiting for customers and collecting wages at the end of the month," and the lazy thinking of "sleeping after selling out and leaving it if unsold." It initially completed asset verification in all independently accounting wholesale stations and stores throughout the country. Beginning in 1953, it embarked on the track of implementing an economic accounting system. However, on the other hand, due to the lack of clear understanding of the position and role of state-owned commerce, and the position and role of state-owned department stores, wholesale stations, and stores, by some leading cadres, and failure to establish a correct and comprehensive economic accounting system idea, namely the idea of "relying on employees, careful calculation, accelerating turnover, saving expenses, implementing policies, and completing plans," coupled with a lack of investigation and research on people's needs, and conservative planning, phenomena such as the out-of-stocking of some commodities and the inability to sell accumulated commodities have emerged. If this situation is not corrected in time, not only will the economic accounting system of the state-owned department store system not be consolidated, but it will also cause serious damage to the country. Therefore, leading cadres of the department store system must establish a comprehensive economic accounting system idea, improve the policy thinking and business skills of grassroots salespersons, thereby enhancing the planning of commodity circulation and solving the serious problem of disconnection between supply and sales in various aspects of commodity circulation.

Holding a special commodity salesperson representative meeting is an effective way to overcome the disconnection between supply and sales

The special commodity salesperson representative meetings held in Handan, Luohe, Xuchang, Jinan, and other places are good ways to improve the policy thinking and business skills of salespersons, enhance the planning of commodity circulation, and overcome the disconnection between supply and sales.

Since December of last year, Handan has experienced an increase in the market's demand for socks, but the state-owned wholesale trade has reduced the supply of socks. Many people believe that this is due to the excessive price difference between urban and rural areas and the incomplete range of socks in stock. When the Handan wholesale station held a symposium of sock salesperson representatives from the retail stores in the supply area, it displayed samples of socks in the wholesale station's inventory and socks sold by private merchants. After comparative research, it was found that the wholesale station's inventory of socks had not all met the market. Although private merchants operated 32 brands of socks that the wholesale station did not have, 24 of them could be replaced by socks of the same quality sold by the wholesale station, and the remaining 8 accounted for only 7 percent of the sales volume. Through the meeting, everyone realized that the decrease in the wholesale sales of socks in Handan was not due to the excessive price difference between urban and rural areas, nor was it due to the incomplete range of brands, but due to poor management and a lack of specialized and in-depth investigation and research. Everyone came up with many specific methods to appropriately expand the wholesale business.

At the specialized commodity salesperson meeting of the Luohe Department Store in Henan, the sock group found that the main reason for the accumulation of women's socks was that the colors were not suitable for the market's needs. As a result, socks with unpopular colors were accumulated, while socks with popular colors were often out of stock. After comparing the quality and specifications, the paper group studied the characteristics of paper used by the people at that time and found that glazed paper, which was suitable for local needs, was often out of stock, but the Luohe Department Store had cultural paper in stock for six months without it being transferred to the retail department. The sugar group studied the past situation where red sugar was often out of stock, while granulated sugar was accumulated too much. Shangcai Store sold more than 120,000 catties of sugar in 1952, of which only more than 10,000 catties were granulated sugar, accounting for 10 percent of the total sales. More than 60,000 catties of granulated sugar were sent in 1952, and more than 50,000 catties are still accumulated. Even if the sales of granulated sugar increase by one time this year, it will still be enough for two years of sales. The store representatives criticized that this year's plan for selling red sugar was too conservative and that too much granulated sugar had been allocated, and proposed to correct the blind purchase of goods.

Salespersons account for the largest majority of all employees in the state-owned department store system. In the commodity circulation process, they meet directly with producers and consumers every day, and they are more familiar with the specific situation. Therefore, the situations they reflect are closer to reality. After their ideological understanding is improved, they will demand to solve the most urgent problem of disconnection between supply and sales in operation. The methods they come up with are mostly practical and feasible.

The issues studied in the specialized commodity salesperson meetings are specialized. Relying on the strength of the masses to study and solve problems from multiple aspects makes it easier to understand the situation and problems thoroughly, meticulously, and deeply. It is also possible to come up with fundamental solutions. On the other hand, clarifying policies and studying specific issues through meetings can improve the political ideology and policy and business skills of salespersons, so that they can recognize the importance of strengthening investigation and research, doing a good job in commodity circulation planning, and implementing commodity circulation plans. In this way, there will be a reliable guarantee for solving the problem of disconnection between commodity supply and sales.

Experiences in holding good specialized commodity salesperson representative meetings

1.  It is necessary to clearly explain the guidelines, tasks, position, and role of the state-owned department store company and the responsibilities and tasks of salespersons. After discussions by the representatives at the various regional salesperson representative meetings, some representatives overcame their views of belittling commercial work, recognized that the work of salespersons is a decisive link in the commodity circulation process, recognized the harm of disconnection between commodity supply and sales to the interests of the country and the people, thereby improving their political awareness and coming up with solutions to the problem responsibly.

2.  It is necessary to explain that the purpose of holding the salesperson representative meeting is mainly to rely on everyone to come up with solutions to the problems existing in commodity circulation, rather than investigating responsibility; it is necessary to explain the important role of solving the problems existing in commodity circulation in implementing the economic accounting system. This will inspire the representatives to use their brains to come up with solutions, and can also eliminate concerns and expose the true situation. For example, the Xuchang wholesale station initially did not clearly explain the significance of the meeting, and took a detour for a day. Luohe accepted this lesson and clarified the purpose of the meeting from the beginning. The representatives' enthusiasm has been high, and they have been able to expose their true thoughts and feelings, so that the problem can be better resolved.

3.  After inspiring the representatives to raise general issues in operation, they should be guided in a timely manner to grasp the main issues, conduct in-depth analysis and criticism, find out the root causes of erroneous thinking, establish correct thinking, and come up with solutions to the problems. At the Luohe specialized commodity salesperson representative meeting, the towel and sock group discussed how to promote the accumulated floral towels. The representative from Zhumadian emphasized that the local purchasing power was low and requested that the towels be transferred out, or accumulated by the higher-level company. During the discussion, everyone believed that not seeing the gradual increase in people's purchasing power and not seeing the changes in people's requirements for commodity quality and colors was a conservative view (of course, on the other hand, it is also necessary to guide and influence people's consumption); now young women and staff have begun to use floral towels, and the price of long-patterned floral towels is not higher than that of white towels. If this continues to develop, floral towels will have sales. Because their thinking was cleared up, the representative from Zhumadian immediately proposed a guarantee to promote 4,700 dozen floral towels.

4.  It is necessary to grasp specific examples and use the method of meticulous accounting and comprehensive accounting to enlighten the representatives' awareness, so as to improve their ideological understanding, give play to their enthusiasm, come up with solutions, and solve specific problems. The paper group of the Luohe Department Store found that the stores all said that they had accumulated a lot of coarse-edged paper, mainly because the price was too high and the salespersons did not want to promote it. In response to this situation, the meeting calculated that the five stores in Zhumadian, Luohe, Runan, Suiping, and Wuyang had a total of more than 5,000 bundles of coarse-edged paper, worth more than 2 billion yuan. The interest on one year of accumulation would be 330 million yuan, plus warehousing rent, insurance, and other expenses. The accumulated 2 billion yuan of funds is equal to the approved funding figures for Suiping, Wuyang, and Runan. This enlightened the representatives' awareness. They said: If it is left for another two or three years, it will be lost. In the past, they told the leading comrades that the coarse-edged paper was priced high and could not be sold. The leading comrades criticized the lower-level cadres for not being responsible for state property. Today, it seems that the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres and the lazy thinking of the salespersons of "sleeping after selling out and leaving it if unsold" are truly irresponsible for state property. They realized the seriousness of the problem and enhanced their sense of responsibility, adjusted the price, and everyone came up with many ways to guarantee that this batch of coarse-edged paper worth more than 2 billion yuan would be sold by the end of the year.

From the effects of the specialized commodity salesperson representative meetings held in various places, in the early stage of implementing the economic accounting system, this is an effective method to mobilize the masses, improve the awareness of salespersons, and rely on them to use their brains and come up with ways to improve operation and management. The state-owned department store system should promote this method, overcome the serious phenomenon of disconnection between supply and sales, and correctly implement the economic accounting system.

    克服商品供销脱节现象的有效方法
    中国百货公司经理  李汝修
    国营百货系统在一九五二年十月至十二月，发动广大群众，揭发工作中的缺点，批判了不算细帐，不负责任的供给制经营思想，批判了“等客上门、月底拿薪”的雇佣观点和“卖完了睡觉、卖不完放着”的懒惰思想，在全国各个独立核算的批发站和商店中，初步完成了核资工作；自一九五三年开始，走上了实行经济核算制的轨道。但另一方面，由于部分领导干部对国营商业的地位与作用，对国营百货公司、批发站、商店的地位与作用认识不清，没有树立起正确的全面的经济核算制思想，即“依靠职工、精打细算、加速流转、节省费用、贯彻政策、完成计划”的思想；加以对人民的需要缺乏调查研究，制订计划时又很保守，这就出现了若干商品脱销，积压的商品又不能推销等现象。这种状况若不及时加以克服，不但国营百货系统的经济核算制不能巩固，并将给国家造成严重损害。因此，百货系统的领导干部必须树立全面的经济核算制思想，提高基层单位营业员的政策思想和业务水平，从而增强商品流转的计划性，解决商品流转各个环节供销脱节的严重问题。
    召开专门商品营业员代表会议，是克服供销脱节的好办法
    邯郸、漯河、许昌、济南等地召开的专门商品营业员代表会议，是提高营业员的政策思想和业务水平，增强商品流转的计划性，克服供销脱节现象的好办法。
    去年十二月以来，邯郸发生了市场需要袜子数量增多，但国营批发贸易袜子供应量减少的现象不少人认为这是城乡差价太大，库存袜子品种不全所致。邯郸批发站召开供应区内门市部袜子营业员代表座谈会时，将批发站库存的和私商出售的袜子的样品都陈列出来，经对照研究后，发现批发站库存袜子没有全部与市场见面。私商经营的袜子虽有三十二种牌号为批发站所没有，但其中有二十四种，批发站可以用同等质量的袜子代替出售，下余的八种仅占销量比重的百分之七。通过会议，大家认识到邯郸的袜子批发营业额变小，不是由于城乡差价太大，也不是由于品种牌号不全，而是由于经营管理不善，缺乏专门的、深入的调查研究工作造成的。大家想出了许多具体办法，适当地扩大批发业务。
    在河南漯河百货商店的专业商品营业员会议上，袜子组检查出积压女用袜子的主要原因是颜色不适合市场的需要。结果，背色的袜子积压起来，而顺色的袜子经常脱销。纸张组经过比质量、比规格，研究了当时人民用纸的特点，发现适合当地需要的有光纸经常脱销，但漯河百货商店库存的文化用纸六个月未提到门市部。糖组研究了过去红糖经常脱销，而砂糖积压太多的情况。上蔡商店一九五二年销糖十二万多斤，其中砂糖只有一万多斤，占总销量百分之十；一九五二年发去了六万多斤砂糖，现在还积压五万多斤，即使今年砂糖增销一倍，还够二年销售。各商店代表都批判了今年销红糖的计划太保守，调拨砂糖太多，提出了纠正盲目进货的意见。
    营业员占国营百货系统全体职工的最大多数，他们在商品流转环节中，天天和生产者与消费者直接见面，他们是比较熟悉具体情况的；因此，他们反映出来的情况比较接近实际。提高了他们的思想认识后，他们就要求解决经营中最迫切需要解决的供销脱节问题，他们想出来的办法大都是切实可行的。
    专门商品营业员会议研究的问题是专门性的，依靠群众的力量，从多方面来研究解决问题的方法，就容易把情况和问题摸清，摸透、摸细、摸深，也就能想出从根本上解决问题的办法来。在另一方面，通过会议交代政策，具体研究问题，就能够提高营业员的政治思想和政策、业务水平，使他们认识到加强调查研究，做好商品流转计划和贯彻执行商品流转计划的重要性，这样，解决商品供销脱节的问题就有了可靠的保证。
    开好专门商品营业员代表会议的经验
    一、要把国营百货公司的方针、任务、地位，作用和营业员的职责、任务等，首先交代清楚。各地营业员代表会议经过讨论以后，某些代表们克服了自己的轻视商业工作的观点，认识到营业员的工作是商品流转过程中的决定环节，认识到商品供销脱节对国家和人民利益的危害性，从而提高了政治觉悟，都来认真负责地想办法解决问题。
    二、必须说明召开营业员代表会议的目的，主要是依靠大家想办法来解决商品流转中存在的问题，而不是追查责任；要说明解决商品流转中存在的问题，对于执行经济核算制的重要作用。这样就能启发代表们开动脑筋想办法，并可消除顾虑，暴露真实情况。如许昌批发站开始对会议的意义交代不明，走了一天弯路。漯河接受了这个教训，开始就交代清楚会议的目的，代表们的情绪一直很高，并能暴露真实思想情况，使问题能够得到更好的解决。
    三、在启发代表们提出了经营上的一般情况后，应及时引导他们抓住主要问题，追根究底地进行分析批判，找出错误思想的根源，树立正确思想，想出解决问题的办法。在漯河专门商品营业员代表会议上，毛巾袜子组曾讨论如何推销积压的花毛巾，驻马店代表强调当地购买力低，要求把毛巾调出，或由上级公司积压起来。在讨论当中，大家认为：看不见人民购买力在逐渐提高，看不见人民对商品质量、花色要求的变化，是一种保守的看法（当然另一方面也要对人民消费给予指导和影响）；现在青年妇女和工作人员已开始用花毛巾，而长格花毛巾价格比白毛巾并不高，这样发展下去，花毛巾是有销路的。由于打通了思想，驻马店代表当场提出了推销四千七百打花毛巾的保证。
    四、必须抓住具体的事例，用算细账、算大账的办法来启发代表们的觉悟，以便提高思想认识，发挥积极性，想出办法，解决具体问题。漯河百货公司纸张组发现各商店都说积存了很多毛边纸，主要原因是价格过高，营业员都不想推销。会议针对这种情况，计算驻马店、漯河、汝南、遂平、舞阳五家商店共存毛边纸五千多篓，价值二十多亿元。积压一年要出利息三亿三千万元，还要出仓租、保险损耗等费用。积压的二十多亿元资金，等于遂平、舞阳、汝南核定资金的数字。这样就启发了代表们的觉悟，他们说：再放两三年就赔光了。过去给领导同志提过，说毛边纸价高销不出去；领导同志批评说下边的干部对国家财产不负责任。今天看来，领导干部的官僚主义作风，和营业员的“卖完了睡觉，卖不了放着”的懒惰思想，才真是对国家财产不负责任。他们认识到问题的严重性，增强了责任心，调整了价格，大家并且想了许多办法，保证在年底把这笔价值二十多亿元的毛边纸推销出去。
    从各地召开的专门商品营业员代表会议的效果来看，在实行经济核算制初期，这是发动群众，提高营业员的觉悟，依靠他们动脑筋、想办法改进经营管理的有效方法。国营百货系统应该推广这一方法，克服供销脱节的严重现象，正确地贯彻经济核算制。
