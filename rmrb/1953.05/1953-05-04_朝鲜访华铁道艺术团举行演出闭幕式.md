Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Korean Democratic People's Republic Railway Art Troupe successfully concluded its visit and performances in China, holding a closing ceremony at the Beijing Youth Palace Theater on the morning of the 3rd. Attending the closing ceremony were Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, Lü Zhengcao, responsible cadres from units such as the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, and more than 800 staff members from the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Railway Administration.

Xu Xingxi, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Korean Embassy in China, and many embassy staff members also attended the closing ceremony.

Deputy Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao said in his closing speech: The Korean Railway Art Troupe visited and performed in our country for nearly three months, performing 65 shows in 15 cities, screening 95 films (the Korean-made film: "Railway Workers of China and Korea in Heroic Struggle"), and holding 15 report meetings, with a total audience of more than 420,000 people. The art troupe's performances in our country greatly encouraged the confidence of the Chinese people, especially railway workers, in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, strengthened the deep fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and promoted cultural exchanges between the two countries.

Lü Zhengcao presented a gift on behalf of all the staff of the Ministry of Railways to the Korean Railway Art Troupe. The audience erupted in warm and prolonged applause.

The head of the art troupe, Li Qingqiu, said in his reply: We have seen the incomparable kindness and enthusiasm of our Chinese comrades, which has further strengthened our belief in the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. We have seen the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and in the country's economic construction, which has further encouraged our will to win victory and made us realize that this is a powerful guarantee of the final victory of the Chinese and Korean people.

Finally, the art troupe performed eleven programs including chorus, solo, and dance at the closing ceremony to bid farewell to the Chinese people. Each of their programs was warmly welcomed by the audience.

After the Korean Railway Art Troupe returned to Beijing, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, held a banquet on the evening of the 2nd to express his regards and farewell to them.
