Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 22nd – In the five days from the 16th to the 20th of this month, the Korean and Chinese People's forces continued to achieve victories in counterattacks and blocking actions.

The battle on the highlands south of Kohori on the Kimcheng front, which began on the 13th, continued fiercely until the 17th. In order to recapture this high ground, which had been seized by our army in a counterattack, the enemy launched frantic counterattacks for days. On the 17th alone, the enemy launched ten consecutive counterattacks with a battalion-sized force. However, all enemy counterattacks were resolutely repelled by our army. In the four-day, five-night battle on this high ground, our army annihilated more than 1,300 soldiers of the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 8th Division.

On the Yuyin Mountain front, after our army captured two positions held by the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 20th Division on the night of the 16th, it inflicted heavy blows on the enemy who came to counterattack. According to preliminary statistics, our army annihilated more than 500 enemies.

On the West Coast, our coastal defense forces repelled an enemy landing attempt on the 17th. At dawn on this day, more than 300 armed bandits entrenched on islands outside the Imjin River estuary, under the cover of twelve aircraft and one gunboat, sailed in twenty-one wooden boats to land near Huayang-ri, southwest of Yan'an. Our coastal defense forces met them head-on and, after a short battle, drove the bandits back into the sea. In this battle, our army annihilated a total of 62 enemy troops.

In addition, our frontline troops eliminated many enemies in many other attacks, blocking actions, and other battles.

In these five days, our army's frontline mobile artillery killed or wounded 699 enemy soldiers; our frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down six enemy planes and damaged twenty-six.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 22nd – This agency's frontline reporter Xu Kong reported on the situation of our army's counterattack operation on the Yuyin Mountain front on May 16th.

On the night of the 16th, it was so dark that one could not see one's hand in front of one's face. The searchlights from the enemy's rear shone brightly on the hills in front of Yuyin Mountain. The soldiers of the 60th Regiment of the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 20th Division, who had been on the position for less than three days, continuously fired tracer bullets down the mountain, fearing that our army would suddenly rush up from the dark valley.

Not far from the enemy's position, a red signal flare suddenly rose. Shells of various calibers from our army flew toward the enemy's position all at once.

The shells detonated the enemy's landmines; the landmines and shells exploded simultaneously, destroying the barbed wire on the enemy's position.

Taking advantage of the smoke screen, our army's assault team rushed onto the enemy's position and eliminated the enemies in the bunkers with submachine guns and grenades.

Some enemies fled toward the back slope of the mountain, where they encountered the interdiction of our army's artillery fire. They quickly turned back and ran, only to run into our army's brave infantry.

The battle was extremely rapid. In just five minutes, our army captured the position of the 6th Company and a search platoon of the 60th Regiment of the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 20th Division.

At dawn the next day, our army's rear sent hot water, hot meals, and a large amount of ammunition to the soldiers.

On the 17th, our army relied on the enemy's fortifications to repel three enemy counterattacks.

At night, the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 20th Division hastily transferred a company from another regiment to reinforce the battered 60th Regiment, attempting to launch another counterattack. However, this company suffered heavy casualties from our army's artillery fire during assembly. The remaining people had just gathered when submachine gun fire rang out from both sides, and our army's infantry rushed down from the newly captured position and eliminated these remaining enemies.

After the battle, our army's soldiers said with a smile: "These two days can be counted as giving the enemy two smooth shaves. Not only can't the enemies on the position escape, but the enemies who come to counterattack can't go back either."

    鱼隐山前线我军炮兵步兵大量歼灭敌人
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本月十六日到二十日五天中，朝中人民部队继续在反击战和阻击战中取得胜利。
    金城前线科湖里以南高地上的战斗，自十三日开始一直猛烈地进行到十七日。敌人为了要夺回这个被我军反击占领的高地，连日发动了疯狂的反扑。仅在十七日敌人即以一个营兵力连续反扑了十次。但敌人所有的反扑都被我军坚决击退。在这个高地四天五夜的战斗中，我军共歼灭李承晚伪军第八师一千三百多人。
    在鱼隐山前线，我军在十六日夜间攻占李承晚伪军第二十师盘踞的两个阵地以后，又给予前来反扑的敌人以严重的打击。据初步统计，我军歼灭了五百多个敌人。
    西海岸我军海防部队，十七日击退敌人一次登陆窜犯。这天拂晓，盘踞在临津江口以外岛屿上的武装匪徒三百多人，在十二架飞机和一艘炮艇的掩护下，分乘木船二十一只驶至延安西南华阳里附近登陆。我海防部队予以迎头痛击，经过短时间的战斗，即将匪徒赶下海去。这次战斗，我军共歼敌六十二名。
    此外，前线我军还在许多次袭击、阻击等战斗中，消灭了许多敌人。
    这五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军六百九十九名；我前线高射炮火共击落敌机六架，击伤敌机二十六架。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本社前线记者徐孔报道鱼隐山前线我军在五月十六日反击作战时的情形。
    十六日夜里，天黑得伸手不见五指，从敌人后方射过来的探照灯光把鱼隐山前的一带山头照得通亮。刚上阵地不到三天的李伪军第二十师六十团的士兵不断地向山下打出曳光弹，他们害怕我军会突然从黑暗的山谷里冲上去。
    离敌人阵地不远的地方忽然升起了红色信号弹。我军各种口径的炮弹一齐飞向敌人的阵地。
    炮弹打响了敌人的地雷；地雷和炮弹同时爆炸，把敌人阵地上的铁丝网炸毁了。
    我军的突击队趁着烟幕冲上敌人的阵地，用冲锋枪和手榴弹消灭了地堡里的敌人。
    有的敌人向山后坡逃命，遇到了我军炮火的拦击，他们连忙回过头来跑，却又碰上了我军英勇的步兵。
    战斗进行得极为迅速，只经五分钟时间，我军就攻下了李伪军二十师六十团第六连和一个搜索排的阵地。
    第二天拂晓，我军后方给战士们送来了开水、热饭和大量弹药。
    十七日白天，我军又依托敌人的工事，打退了敌人三次反扑。
    夜里，李伪军第二十师慌忙在另一个团里抽调一个连来增援受到打击的六十团，企图再次发动反扑。可是这个连在集结的时候，就被我军炮火杀伤了一大半。剩下来的人刚刚集中起来，两侧又响起了冲锋枪声，我军步兵从刚占领的阵地上冲下来，消灭了这些残余的敌人。
    战后，我军战士们笑着说：“这两天算给敌人痛痛快快地推了两个光头。不但阵地上的敌人跑不了，来反扑的敌人也回不去。”
