Anhui and Henan Provinces' farmers in areas affected by frost damage are actively engaged in production for self-salvation under the leadership of the Party and the government.

The People's Government of Anhui Province issued instructions on production and disaster relief work after the frost disaster, emphasizing that "extracting wealth from the land" is the most fundamental way to overcome famine. At the same time, it called on every household in the disaster area to plant two to three fen of vegetables, 100 to 150 melon plants, and leave no land idle, striving to achieve the requirement of "melons, vegetables, gourds, pinellia, and half grain," and to store melons and dry vegetables in preparation for winter shortages. In addition, non-disaster areas at all levels of government are required to seize the production season, lead the masses to actively produce, strive for a bumper harvest, and plant more melons and vegetables to supplement food rations during the period of food shortage. Su County District has already rushed to plant 1.14 million mu of early autumn crops such as sorghum and soybeans.

Dancheng and Shenqiu counties in Henan Province have universally convened farmer representative meetings to stabilize the people's emotions and find ways to overcome the famine through production. The meeting first reversed the representatives' emotions of lacking confidence in overcoming the famine and simply relying on relief, and then, through typical speeches and detailed accounting, identified ways to overcome the famine. Many representatives at the meeting drafted production plans to overcome the famine. Li Xianping, secretary of the Yanshi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, went deep into the severely affected townships to visit farmers and study the key to production and disaster relief. After joint research with farmers and township cadres, he found more than 20 kinds of sideline production methods, discovered 17 kinds of edible wild vegetables, and more than 100 wells that could be used to plant early-maturing crops. He then convened a symposium of district and township cadres to discuss how to lead farmers in production for self-salvation, enabling the cadres to have a deeper understanding of relying on the masses and using methods of increasing production and practicing economy to overcome the famine. After the cadres conducted extensive and in-depth mobilization among the masses of farmers, many severely affected households have formulated plans for agriculture, sideline occupations, frugality, and collecting wild vegetables.

However, the work of production and disaster relief in frost-affected areas is still very uneven. Many cadres and masses in some areas do not sufficiently recognize the importance of actively increasing grain production and production for self-salvation, and some still have the idea of simply relying on relief. Therefore, disaster areas must seize the agricultural season, lead farmers to actively increase grain production, plant more melons, vegetables, and tubers, and help the masses solve the problem of seeds and seedlings, and carry out a movement of production for disaster relief and economical preparedness against famine.

### 安徽河南遭受霜灾地区农民积极生产自救

    安徽河南遭受霜灾地区农民积极生产自救
    【本报讯】安徽、河南遭受霜灾地区的农民，在党和政府的领导下，正积极生产救灾。
    安徽省人民政府发出了关于霜灾后生产救灾工作的指示，着重指出“地里取财”是战胜灾荒的最根本办法，同时号召灾区每一农户种菜二分到三分，种瓜一百棵到一百五十棵，不留一块闲地，争取做到“瓜菜葫芦半夏粮”的要求，并要贮瓜晒菜以备冬荒。另外要求非灾区各级人民政府抓紧生产季节，领导群众积极生产，争取丰收；并多种瓜菜，补助青黄不接时期的口粮。宿县专区已抢种大小秫秫、黄豆等早秋作物一百一十四万亩。
    河南省郸城、沈邱两县普遍召开了农民代表会议，安定群众情绪，找生产度荒门路。会上首先扭转了代表们没有信心度荒，单纯依靠救济的情绪，然后经过典型发言、算细账，找出了度荒门路。不少代表在会上订出了生产度荒计划。中共偃师县委书记李先平深入重灾乡访问农民，研究生产救灾的关键所在，经过和农民及乡干部共同研究，找到了副业生产门路二十多种，发现了可吃的野菜十七种，还有一百多眼水井能点种早熟作物。他随后召开区、乡干部座谈会，讨论如何领导农民进行生产自救，使干部们对依靠群众、运用增产节约的方法战胜灾荒，有了较深入的了解。当干部们在农民群众中进行广泛深入的动员后，很多重灾户都订出了农业、副业、省吃俭用和采集野菜的计划。
    但是，目前遭受霜灾地区的生产救灾工作还很不平衡。不少地区的干部和群众对积极增产粮食和生产自救的重要性认识不够，有的仍有单纯依靠救济的想法。因此受灾地区必须抓紧农事季节，领导农民积极增产粮食，多种瓜、菜、薯类，并帮助群众解决种苗问题，开展生产救灾节约备荒运动。
