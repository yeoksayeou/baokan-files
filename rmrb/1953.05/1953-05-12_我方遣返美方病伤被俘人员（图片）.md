    Our side repatriates sick and wounded U.S. POWs
    The repatriated sick and wounded U.S. POWs have consistently received humanitarian treatment from our side. After arriving at the concentration point, they were warmly received by our side. This is a scene from the grand farewell meeting held in our POW camp the day before repatriation.
    Under the strict surveillance of American military police, enemy prisoners of war boarded American vehicles with heavy and melancholy hearts.

    我方遣返美方病伤被俘人员
    被遣返的美方病伤战俘一贯受着我方人道主义的待遇。他们到达集中地点后，又受到了我方热情的招待。这是遣返的前一天在我方战俘营举行隆重的告别会的情形。
    在美国宪兵森严的监视下，敌方战俘带着沉重忧郁的心情走上美国汽车。
