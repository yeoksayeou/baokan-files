    Further Improve the Planned Distribution of Newspapers and Magazines

    Since January of this year, we have received over four hundred letters from readers across the country, raising concerns about the chaotic phenomena in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. The main issues reflected in these letters are: since the implementation of planned distribution for all newspapers and magazines in January of this year, the demand for some major Beijing-edition magazines far exceeds the supply; it is common across the country that people who need magazines cannot buy or subscribe to them, or even if they subscribe, they don't receive them or are forced to cancel their subscriptions. Many readers are very dissatisfied, and post offices across the country are overwhelmed. Some letters also reflect that the pre-order system implemented by post offices in some areas is too rigid, causing great inconvenience to readers. Readers pointed out in their letters that the above situation has seriously affected the study and work of the broad masses of people and must be resolved quickly.

    Why did the above situation occur? According to our understanding, there are three main reasons: First, the planned distribution numbers for some magazines in the first quarter of this year (especially some major Beijing-edition magazines) were not accurately determined; some were underestimated. Second, the postal system was not adequately prepared ideologically and organizationally to take over the distribution of all magazines and implement planned distribution; hastily taking over, there were many unreasonable aspects in the regional allocation of magazine distribution. Third, little publicity was done before and after the further promotion of the work; many distribution work cadres and the broad masses of people do not fully understand the spirit and methods of planned distribution.

    In order to solve the problem of insufficient supply of some major Beijing-edition magazines, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the General Administration of Publications have re-verified the planned distribution numbers for the second quarter in early April. The planned distribution numbers for more than forty magazines, including "Current Affairs Handbook," "Study," "World Knowledge," and "People's Education," have been increased.

    We believe that it is absolutely necessary to first solve the problem of insufficient supply of some major Beijing-edition magazines at present. However, to further eliminate the unreasonable phenomena in the distribution of newspapers and magazines, and to further improve the planned distribution work, so as to achieve the goal of making the publication and distribution of newspapers and magazines more rational, truly distributing them to the masses of people who urgently need them, and giving greater practical political effect to newspapers and magazines, the following issues must also be paid attention to.

    First, it should be admitted that the planned distribution numbers we have currently verified are still difficult to fully meet actual needs, and necessary adjustments must continue to be made in the future. Both postal departments and publishing administrative agencies should conduct investigation and research in this regard, and increase or decrease the planned distribution numbers of various newspapers and magazines based on the actual situation. At the same time, post offices should also make reasonable allocations based on the nature of newspapers and magazines, and according to the different needs of urban and rural areas. In this way, we can clarify the objective needs and distribution targets of various newspapers and magazines within a certain period of time, and lay the foundation for planned distribution.

    Second, the requirements for newspaper pre-order methods in the past were too high and should be changed. The method of pre-ordering newspapers and magazines by quarter is generally difficult to implement at present; it should be changed from monthly pre-orders to allowing readers to voluntarily subscribe for one quarter or one year at the same time. The dates and methods for pre-collecting newspaper fees should also not be prescribed too rigidly, and there should be flexible methods. In addition, under the principle of striving to increase the proportion of pre-orders as much as possible, all regions—especially large cities—should stipulate a certain retail proportion; otherwise, distribution work will become passive and readers will be dissatisfied.

    Third, strengthen the unified leadership of distribution work, and strengthen the connection between postal departments, publishing administrative departments, various newspaper offices, and various magazine offices. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the General Administration of Publications, and relevant departments should strengthen the publicity and explanation of planned distribution issues to distribution staff and readers.

### 进一步做好报刊的计划发行工作

专栏：读者来信述评

    进一步做好报刊的计划发行工作
    今年一月以来，我们陆续收到来自全国各地的四百多件读者来信，对报刊发行工作中的混乱现象提出意见。这些来信中反映的主要问题是：今年一月全部报刊实行计划发行以后，北京版的一些主要杂志供不应求的现象很严重；各地普遍发生需要杂志的人买不到、订不到，甚至订了收不到、或被迫退订的情况。很多读者大为不满，各地邮局也弄得焦头烂额。还有一部分来信反映：有些地方的邮局执行预订制度太机械，使读者极感麻烦。读者们来信指出：以上情况已经严重地影响了广大人民的学习和工作，必须迅速解决。
    为什么会发生以上情况呢？根据我们了解，主要有以下三个原因：一，今年第一季度有些杂志（特别是北京版的一些主要杂志）的计划发行数字核定得不尽恰当；有些订得过低。二，邮局系统对接办全部杂志发行工作、实行计划发行的思想准备、组织准备都还不够；仓促接过来，在杂志发行的地区分配等方面有很多不合理的地方。三，进一步推行工作的前后，宣传工作做得少；不少发行工作干部和广大群众对计划发行工作的精神和办法都不很了解。
    为了解决北京版某些主要杂志供不应求的问题，现邮电部和出版总署已在四月初重新核订了第二季度的期刊计划发行数字。“时事手册”、“学习”、“世界知识”、“人民教育”等四十多种杂志的计划发行数字已经提高。
    我们认为：在目前，首先解决北京版某些主要杂志供不应求的问题是完全必要的。但要进一步消除报刊发行工作中的不合理现象，进一步做好计划发行工作，以达到使报刊的出版和分配更加合理、真正发行到迫切需要它的人民群众手中、发挥报刊更大的实际政治效用的目的，还必须注意以下几个问题。
    一，应该承认，我们现在核定的计划发行数字还是很难完全适合实际需要的，今后一定要继续进行必要的调整。邮政部门和出版行政机关都应该在这方面进行调查研究工作，根据实际情况把各种报刊的计划发行数字提高或降低。同时，邮局也应根据报刊的性质，按照实际情况，区别城乡需要的不同进行合理的分配。这样，我们就能在一定时期内搞清各种报刊客观需要和发行对象，打下计划发行的基础。
    二，过去报纸预订办法的要求过高，应有所改变。报纸、杂志按季预订的办法目前一般尚难行通；应改为从按月预订到同时允许订一季或一年均听读者自愿。预收报费的日期和办法也不应规定得太死，应有变通的办法。此外，在尽可能求得增加预订比例的原则下，各地——特别是大城市应该规定一定的零售比例；否则将会使发行工作被动，并使读者不满。
    三，加强发行工作的统一领导，加强邮政部门、出版行政部门、各报社和各杂志社之间的联系。邮电部和出版总署及有关部门应向发行工作人员和读者加强关于计划发行问题的宣传解释工作。
