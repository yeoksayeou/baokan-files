Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th: British public opinion continues to express dissatisfaction with the United States regarding the Korean armistice negotiations.

The conservative "Observer" commented on the 17th: "If negotiations break down now, many honest people in the free world will think that the (American) State Department, not the Communists, is to blame."

The "Sunday Pictorial" published an article by Richard Crossman on the same day, which said: If American representatives continue to put forward proposals that they know the Chinese will not agree to, then an armistice is out of the question. Crossman went on to say: If the United States continues to act arbitrarily in Korea, Britain will have no choice but to withdraw its troops and "let the Americans 'go it alone'."

The "Reynold News" pointed out in its commentary on the 17th: It is the American representatives who are delaying in Korea. The newspaper said: "The US government should understand unequivocally that it cannot expect to drag Britain along to implement a policy that is clearly contrary to our vital interests."

The "Sunday Times" commented on the 17th: "There is already a feeling among federal countries that American military negotiators are too insistent on their proposals."

Strachey, former Labor Government Secretary of State for War, who criticized US Far East policy in the British House of Commons on the 11th, again criticized the United States' go-it-alone policy in a speech at the Oxford University Labor Party Club on the 15th. He said that the American negotiators in Panmunjom appeared to have "little or no sincerity" in seeking an armistice. He warned that if the Korean armistice negotiations were to break down, the situation in the Far East would seriously deteriorate. He said that the United States is currently pursuing "a policy of intervention in China," and said: "If the United States insists on continuing to do so, then the British government will have no choice but to adopt an independent foreign policy."

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: After British Prime Minister Churchill and Labor Party leader Attlee delivered speeches in the British House of Commons expressing dissatisfaction with the policies and attitudes of the United States, a group of extreme reactionaries in the United States launched rude attacks on Britain, which again aroused a wave of sharp retaliation in Britain.

After learning of Attlee's speech, US Senator Joseph McCarthy demanded an apology from Attlee, calling Attlee "that thing" and cursing and insulting him. Senator Allen Ellender spoke at length about Attlee's speech as a blow to "those who feed Britain." Senator Everett Dirksen threatened in the Senate with not giving Britain "aid," and said in an arrogant and sarcastic tone: "British representatives will come to us like beggars and plead: 'Mr. America, Mrs. America, give us a little more, extend the time a little longer.'"

This rude abuse and intimidation of British political leaders by American congressmen has aroused strong resentment in British public opinion. Tom O'Brien, chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, delivered a speech at a meeting of 500 British industrialists organized by the Management Association in London on the 14th: "If responsible American politicians are willing to maintain friendship with us, they must treat us with the same respect and understanding as we treat them." "They should not rub salt in our wounds just because we are not as strong and rich as we used to be. This is utter rudeness and arrogance. Let them understand this." Tom O'Brien said that he was "pro-American," "but some people in industry, politics, and trade unions are getting a little tired of being pro-American."

Many important British bourgeois newspapers have published commentaries expressing dissatisfaction. The British Labor Party's organ, the "Daily Herald," published an editorial entitled "Evil Senators," expressing regret that people like McCarthy, who should be "given the contempt they deserve," "hold powerful positions in the US Congress." The "Daily Mirror" called McCarthy's attacks "ravings" and "warned" Eisenhower and McCarthy that Britain was not "a blind, silent, and obedient ally." The "Daily Express" advocated that Britain break free from the shackles of "American aid" and restore Britain's independence. It said: "Because Britain accepts this alms, and continues to accept this alms, it has lost its independence."

Britain's open expression of its different views has led some American bourgeois commentators to openly question the role of the dollar. The Scripps-Howard newspaper chain said in an editorial: "As far as the United States is concerned, we can learn the following lesson from our experience in Europe: that money cannot buy friends..."

    英国报纸继续指责美国拖延朝鲜停战谈判
    并还击美国极端反动分子麦卡锡等对英国的攻击
    【新华社十九日讯】伦敦消息：英国舆论继续就朝鲜停战谈判问题发表对美国表示不满的意见。
    保守的“观察家报”十七日评论说：“如果谈判现在要破裂，许多自由世界的正直人民会认为：应该怪（美国）国务院，而不是共产党。”
    同一天出版的“星期日画报”刊载了里查德·克罗斯曼的文章，其中说：如果美国代表们继续提出他们明知中国人不会同意的建议，那么停战就谈不到。克罗斯曼接着说：如果美国继续在朝鲜独断专行，英国只有把军队撤走，“让美国人‘独自去干’。”
    “雷诺新闻”十七日的评论中指出：在朝鲜从事拖延的是美国代表们。该报说：“美国政府应该毫不含糊地理解到：它不能期待把英国拖在一起，来执行一种显然与我们的切身利益背道而驰的政策。”
    “星期日泰晤士报”十七日发表评论说：“联邦国家间已经有这样一种情绪，认为美国的军事谈判代表过于固执他们的建议。”
    十一日曾在英国下院发言抨击美国远东政策的前工党政府陆军大臣斯特拉彻，十五日在牛津大学工党俱乐部演说时，再次抨击美国一意孤行。他说板门店的美国谈判代表显得“很少有诚意、甚至没有诚意”要求停战。他警告说，如果使朝鲜停战谈判破裂，远东局势将严重恶化。他说美国目前正在
    “对中国进行干涉政策”，并说：“如果美国坚持这样做下去，那么，英国政府就只有采取独立的外交政策。”
    【新华社十九日讯】英国首相邱吉尔和工党领袖艾德礼在英国下议院发表了对美国的政策和态度表示不满的演说后，美国的一批极端的反动分子对英国进行粗暴的攻击，又在英国激起了一阵尖锐的还击。
    美国参议员约瑟夫·麦卡锡在得知艾德礼的演说后，要求艾德礼道歉，称艾德礼为“这个东西”并破口大骂和侮辱。参议员艾伦·埃伦大谈艾德礼的演说是对“供养英国的人”的打击。参议员埃弗里特·德克森在参院发表演说，以不给英国“援助”进行威胁，他以傲慢而讥讽的语气说：“英国的代表将像乞丐似的来到我们面前恳求道：‘美国先生、美国太太、再多给一点吧，时间再延长一些吧。’”
    美国议员对英国政治领袖这种粗鲁的辱骂和恫吓，引起了英国舆论的强烈反感。英国职工大会主席汤姆·奥勃莱恩十四日在伦敦一个由经理协会所组织的、有五百个英国工业家参加的会上发表演说说：“假使美国负责的政治家愿意与我们保持友好的话，他们必须以与我们对他们的同样的尊敬和谅解态度来对待我们。”“他们不要由于我们不像过去那样强大和有钱就在我们的伤口上擦把盐。这是彻头彻尾的粗暴与傲慢。让他们明了这点。”汤姆·奥勃莱恩说，他是“亲美的”，“但是工业部门、政界和工会方面有些人对于亲美，已经有点厌倦了。”
    不少英国资产阶级的重要报纸发表评论，表示不满。英国工党的机关报“每日先驱报”发表一篇社论，以“邪恶的参议员”为标题，对像麦卡锡这样的应该“投以应得的蔑视眼光”的人而“在美国国会占有权势的地位”表示遗憾。“每日镜报”称麦卡锡的攻击为“呓语”，并“警告”艾森豪威尔和麦卡锡，英国并不是“一个盲目的、闭口的与唯命是从的盟国”。“每日快报”主张英国解脱“美援”的束缚，恢复英国的独立。它说：“由于英国接受这种布施，并且继续接受这种布施，使得它失去了它的独立性。”
    英国这次公开表示自己不同的主张，已使美国一部分资产阶级言论对美元的作用公开表示怀疑，斯克里浦斯——霍华德系的报纸在一篇社论中说：“就美国而论，我们可以从我们在欧洲的经验中获得以下教训：就是金钱并不能收买到朋友……”
