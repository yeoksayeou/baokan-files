Beijing Western Suburbs Cultural District
Constructing the Steel and Iron Industry Institute

The Beijing Steel and Iron Industry Institute, the first school in China specializing in training theoretical and technical cadres for the steel and iron industry, is being actively prepared for construction in the western suburbs cultural district of Beijing. This is a new type of higher education institution with modern equipment. It will have various laboratories and small factories for students to practice in, including woodworking, machinery, fitter, welding, forging, casting, electrical work, and heat treatment. It will also have bathrooms, barbershops, a library, a gymnasium, a sports field, a swimming pool, a school for employees’ children, and a kindergarten. The total construction area is 157,200 square meters. Construction will begin this year and is planned to be completed in three years.

The school's mission and purpose is to cultivate engineers with a high level of political awareness who can master theoretical knowledge of the steel and iron industry and metallurgical technology. To achieve this goal, the institute will combine China's specific conditions and adopt the advanced teaching system and methods of the Soviet Steel Institute. It will use advanced Soviet steel and iron industry theories, technical knowledge, and production experience as teaching materials, and plans to hire more than 20 Soviet experts to guide and teach specialized courses.

The Beijing Steel and Iron Industry Institute is currently attached to Tsinghua University and has 846 students. After the new campus is completed, it will temporarily establish six departments: mining, smelting, steel pressure processing, metallography and heat treatment, steel machinery, and steel enterprise engineering economics. According to the progress of the campus construction, it is planned to enroll 1,000 new students in the autumn of 1953 (including 100 graduate students). From 1954, it will enroll 1,360 new students each year (including 100 graduate students). The undergraduate program will be four years, and the graduate program will be two years. The goal is to gradually develop to 5,040 undergraduates and 300 graduate students.

Undertaking the construction task is the entire staff of the First Engineering Zone of the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Central Heavy Industry Department. They have previously built large-scale factories in Northeast China and the Northeast Institute of Metals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and have some construction experience. According to the overall plan, they will complete the construction of 43,000 square meters this year. After two months of intense preparation, most of the building materials have been transported to the site, and nearly 2,000 workers have recently been投入工into the construction site. However, due to the design not keeping up, construction will not be able to fully start until mid-May to early June. In order to overcome idle work, the workers are building 14,000 square meters of temporary structures. There are also dormitory projects with a construction area of 9,468 square meters that can use standard drawings, and the operation plan is currently being compiled. It is expected that all projects this year will be completed by September 5.

    北京西郊文化区
    修建钢铁工业学院
    我国历史上第一座专门培养钢铁工业理论、技术干部的学校——北京钢铁工业学院，正在北京市西郊文化区积极筹备建筑中。这是一所新型的有近代化设备的高等学校，有各式各样的实验室和专供学生实习用的木工、机械、钳工、焊工、锻工、铸工、电工、热工等小型工厂，有浴室、理发室、图书馆、体育馆、运动场和游泳池，还有子弟学校和幼儿园。全部建筑面积为十五万七千二百平方公尺，今年开始建筑，计划三年完成。
    这个学校的任务和目的是负责培养具有高度政治水平，并能掌握钢铁工业理论知识及冶金技术的工程师。为了达到这一目的，该院将结合中国具体情况，采取苏联钢铁学院的先进教学制度和教学方法，采用苏联先进的钢铁工业理论、技术知识和生产经验作为教材，并拟聘请二十余位苏联专家担任指导和讲授专业课程。
    北京钢铁工业学院目前附设在清华大学内，已有学生八百四十六人。新校建成后，将暂设采矿、冶炼、钢铁压力加工、金相及热处理、钢铁机械、钢铁企业工程经济等六系。根据建校工程进展情况，计划一九五三年秋季招收新生一千人（其中研究生一百人），从一九五四年开始，每年招收新生一三六○人（其中研究生一百人）。本科生定为四年结业，研究生二年结业。逐年发展，以本科生五千零四十人、研究生三百人为目标。
    担任这项工程建筑任务的是中央重工业部直属建设工程公司第一工区的全体职工，他们过去在东北建筑过规模庞大的工厂，也建筑过中国科学院东北金属研究所，有一些施工经验。根据总的计划，他们今年要完成四万三千平方公尺面积的建筑工程，经过两个月来的紧张准备，目前大部分建筑材料均已运达现场，最近已有近两千工人投入工地。但由于设计赶不及，要到五月中旬至六月上旬才能全部开工。为了克服窝工，工人们正在建筑一万四千平方公尺的暂设工程，还有九千四百六十八平方公尺建筑面积可用标准图的宿舍工程，目前正在编制作业计划，预计今年度全部工程将在九月五日完工。
