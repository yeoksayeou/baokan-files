    “Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!” Introduction to the Chinese Edition of Issue 18, 1953

    The Chinese edition of Issue 18, 1953, of the Cominform organ "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

    To commemorate May Day, this issue published an editorial entitled "The Great Festival of Solidarity of the Working People of the World." The editorial stated that this year's May Day is being celebrated amidst the rising tide of struggle to maintain and consolidate peace and strengthen friendship among the peoples of all countries. The editorial pointed out that the consistent peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union and other countries of the democratic and socialist camp is inspiring the struggles of the working people in the capitalist world. The recent editorial in the Soviet "Pravda" entitled "Regarding President Eisenhower's Speech," and the recent telegrams from the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China to the International Committee of the World People's Peace Congress, expressing support for the proposal of the five major powers to negotiate a peace pact, are very important documents of great international significance for the cause of peace. The statements contained in these documents provide a concrete basis for resolving major international issues. The editorial concluded by saying that the Communist and Workers' Parties, armed with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, are leading the people in the struggle for peace.

    This issue publishes the full text of the Pravda editorial entitled "Regarding President Eisenhower's Speech," as well as the telegrams from the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China in reply to the International Committee of the World People's Peace Congress.

    To commemorate May Day, this issue published many important articles, including "The Great Friendship of the People of the Democratic and Socialist Camp" by Zhu De, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; "May Day in France" by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party; "Right-Wing Social Democratic Leaders Are Enemies of Proletarian Internationalism" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain; "The German People Struggle for a Unified, Independent, Democratic, and Peace-Loving Germany" by Hermann Matern, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany; and "Striving for Better Living Conditions, Striving for National Independence, Striving for Peace!" by Giuseppe Vittorio, one of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party.

    Zhu De's article pointed out that the great friendship of the people of the democratic and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is one of the most important legacies that the immortal Stalin left to all mankind. The people of the countries in this camp help and cooperate with each other economically, and are completely united politically. This noble friendship is a vivid manifestation of the internationalist spirit of the victorious working people of all countries, and cannot be separated by any force.

    Duclos's article analyzes the current economic characteristics of France and the political situation arising therefrom. He pointed out that the solidarity movement of the French working class has been demonstrated in the municipal council elections on April 26th: the French Communist Party won the most votes in Paris, Marseille, and many other towns and cities, and nationwide, the Communist Party maintained its position as the largest party in France. May Day in 1953 is a momentous day in the history of the French workers' movement. The French working class is struggling to fundamentally improve the lives of workers, defend freedom, and defeat war policies and policies that betray national independence. Pollitt's article stated that British workers have always shown a great spirit of international solidarity. Unfortunately, right-wing leaders of the British Labour Party are trying to prevent the consolidation of the domestic and international working-class forces. Therefore, this year on May Day, when workers across Britain participate in marches and demonstrations, peace and unity will be their most important slogans. Matern's article pointed out that in West Germany, the main feature of the current struggle is that social democrats and workers from other parties and those with no party affiliation are fighting alongside the Communists. The German Democratic Republic is a solid base for carrying out the victorious struggle to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and restore national unity to Germany. The main task of the German people today is to transform these movements into a unified and powerful force. Vittorio's article stated that the working class in all capitalist countries, colonies, and semi-colonies is celebrating May Day while fighting for work and bread, for the trade union and social rights of the working class. These basic demands of the working class are closely linked to the struggle for democratic freedoms, national independence, and peace. The brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries have inspired them to move forward.

    This issue also publishes "Advancing Along the Road of Socialist Construction" by Antonín Novotný, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. This article points out that today, the task facing the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is to implement the new party constitution, modeled on the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and to study in greater depth Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party. This issue also publishes an article by Stefan Jedrychowski, member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, entitled "The Development of the Polish Economy and the Increase in National Income." This article uses concrete figures to illustrate the great achievements made by the Polish people in the three years of implementing the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955).

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第十八期中文版介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第十八期中文版已经出版。
    本期为纪念“五一”劳动节，发表了题为“全世界劳动人民团结的伟大节日”的社论，社论说：今年的“五一”节是在保持和巩固和平以及加强各国人民间的友谊的斗争日益高涨的情况下举行庆祝的。社论指出，苏联和民主与社会主义阵营其他各国一贯奉行的和平政策，鼓舞着资本主义世界劳动人民所进行的斗争。苏联“真理报”最近发表的题为“关于艾森豪威尔总统的演说”的社论，苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府最近分别答复世界人民和平大会国际委员会，表示支持五大国协商缔结和平公约主张的函电，都是对和平事业非常重要的具有重大国际意义的文件。这些文件中所包含的声明，提供了解决重大的国际问题的具体的基础。社论最后说，用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说武装起来的共产党和工人党，正在领导着人民争取和平的斗争。
    本期全文刊载了真理报题为“关于艾森豪威尔总统的演说”的社论，以及苏联政府及中华人民共和国政府分别答复世界人民和平大会国际委员会的电文。
    本期为了纪念“五一”节，刊载了许多重要文章，其中有中国共产党中央政治局委员朱德的“民主社会主义阵营各国人民的伟大友谊”，法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛的“五一节在法国”，英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特的“右翼社会党领袖是无产阶级国际主义的敌人”，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员赫尔曼·马特恩的“德国人民为统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国而斗争”，意大利共产党领导人之一朱塞佩·维多里奥的“争取较好的生活条件，争取民族独立，争取和平！”。
    朱德的文章指出：以苏联为首的民主社会主义阵营各国人民的伟大友谊，是不朽的斯大林遗留给全人类的最重要遗产之一。这个阵营的各国人民在经济上是互助合作，在政治上是完全团结一致的。这种崇高的友谊是胜利了的各国劳动人民国际主义精神的生动表现，是任何力量所不能分离的。
    杜克洛的文章分析了法国当前的经济特点和由此而产生的政治形势。他指出，法国工人阶级的团结运动，已经在四月二十六日的市政委员会的选举中表现出来：法国共产党在巴黎、马赛和其他许多市镇所得的选票都居第一位，就全国范围来说，共产党保持法国第一大党的地位。一九五三年的“五一”节，在法国工人运动史上是一个重大的日子，法国的工人阶级正在进行斗争，争取工人生活的根本改善，保卫自由，挫败战争政策和出卖民族独立的政策。波立特的文章说：英国的工人一向表现出有着伟大的国际团结精神。不幸的是，英国工党右翼领袖正在力图阻止国内和国际工人阶级力量的团结巩固起来。所以，在今年的“五一”节，当全英国的工人参加游行示威时，和平和团结就成为他们最主要的口号。马特恩的文章指出，在西德，当前斗争的主要特点是社会民主党和其他党派以及无党无派的工人们，正在同共产党人一道进行斗争。德意志民主共和国是进行争取缔结对德和约和争取恢复德国全国统一的胜利斗争的坚固基地。德国人民当前的主要任务是，把这些运动变成统一的、强有力的力量。维多里奥的文章中说：所有资本主义国家、殖民地和半殖民地的工人阶级，都在争取工作和面包、争取工人阶级的工会权利和社会权利的情况下庆祝“五一”节。工人阶级这些基本要求，与争取民主自由、民族独立、争取和平的斗争密切联系着。苏联、中国和人民民主国家的辉煌成就，鼓舞了他们向前迈进。
    本期还刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团委员安托宁·诺沃提尼的“沿着社会主义建设的大道前进”。这篇文章指出：今天，捷克斯洛伐克共产党面临的任务就是实行以苏联共产党党章为典范而制定的新党章，更深入地学习斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件。本期还刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员斯特凡·英德里霍夫斯基的“波兰经济的发展与国民收入的增加”一文。这篇文章用具体的数字说明了波兰人民三年来在执行六年计划（一九五○年—一九五五年）的工作中所获得的巨大成就。        （新华社）
