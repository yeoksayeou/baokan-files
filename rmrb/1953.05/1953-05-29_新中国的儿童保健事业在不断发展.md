Children's health services in New China are developing continuously.

First, from the perspective of healthcare institutions: According to statistics from February 1952, there were a total of more than 19,200 public obstetrics and gynecology hospitals, maternal and child health hospitals, maternal and child health centers, as well as public and private maternal and child health stations and private midwifery stations nationwide. By the end of 1952, this number had increased to more than 34,000. The maternal and child health work teams composed of the Provincial People's Government Health Departments have also increased from 12 in 1951 to the current 21. When the country was first liberated, there was only one children's hospital nationwide, run by the reactionary Kuomintang government. Currently, there are five public children's hospitals nationwide, with six times more beds than before liberation. Another one or two will be built this year, and the number of beds will be expanded to more than 20 times that before liberation. Taking Guangzhou as an example, all eleven districts in the city have now established maternal and child health centers. The centers have professional obstetricians and surgical equipment to solve general dystocia problems. Under the leadership of the maternal and child health centers, 25 districts have established jointly-run (public and private) maternal and child health stations. The stations have complete midwifery medicines and equipment, as well as a considerable number of delivery beds and infant beds. This spring, 20 midwifery stations were established in the suburbs of the city, and it is planned to establish another 30 in the second half of the year. Together with the existing 34, almost every natural village will have a midwifery station, which can basically eliminate old-style midwifery.

In order to strengthen children's health work and women's health work, in cities where conditions permit, the maternal and child health business institutions of the health departments of the people's governments at all levels have been divided into children's health institutions and women's health institutions. Last year, children's health centers were established in nine cities, including Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Xi'an.

In order to ensure the safety and health of newborns and puerperae, the People's Government has vigorously promoted new-style midwifery since the liberation of the whole country. By the end of 1951, the People's Government Health Department, in cooperation with the Democratic Women's Federation, had trained more than 160,000 midwives and reformed old midwives. By the end of 1952, there were more than 260,000 trained midwives and reformed old midwives. These midwives and reformed old midwives played a great role. Zhang Xifeng, a midwife in the third district of Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has delivered 49 babies using the new midwifery method in two years since receiving training in 1950, without a single death. She herself had given birth to six children in the past, and five died of tetanus due to old-style midwifery. The People's Government has also set up free delivery quotas for poor and difficult births. This year, 2 million free places have been set up, many times more than last year. Due to the promotion of new-style midwifery, the mortality rate of newborn tetanus has been decreasing year by year. According to surveys in Beijing and Dalian, no cases of newborns dying of tetanus occurred in these two cities in 1952.

The number of children receiving free vaccinations and immunizations is also increasing year by year. In 1951, a total of more than 1.6 million children were injected with diphtheria toxoid. Last year, about 2 million were injected. Regarding BCG vaccination, 1.98 million children have been vaccinated since liberation. In 1949, BCG vaccination was only carried out in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. Now it has been implemented in more than 100 cities. Due to the complicated BCG vaccination procedures, it can only be implemented in some cities with conditions. This year, an oral BCG vaccine will be manufactured. Oral administration can avoid complicated injection procedures. Therefore, the area where vaccination is implemented can be expanded in the future. The local reaction caused by the oral agent is also lighter than that of the injectable agent.

Many children in many cities can enjoy a free health check-up every Children's Day. More than one million children have been checked in the past three years.

Under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, the People's Government Health Department has added many new contents to children's health work this year. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government is beginning to promote new parenting methods, currently focusing on preventing diseases that children are most susceptible to, such as measles, diarrhea, and colds. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has compiled and printed more than 20 kinds of pamphlets on new parenting methods, and is preparing to cooperate with the Democratic Women's Federation to train a group of women to assist in promoting new parenting methods. In some nurseries, the method of injecting the mother's blood to reduce the severity of measles in children or delay the onset of the disease has recently been promoted. The Beijing Maternal and Child Health Hospital is experimenting with tissue therapy to treat infantile eczema, which is the most common and difficult-to-cure disease in infants. These methods have shown good results after preliminary experiments. After further experiments and definite results are obtained, the People's Government Health Department will cooperate with relevant groups to fully promote these advanced Soviet experiences in children's health care.

### 新中国的儿童保健事业在不断发展

    新中国的儿童保健事业在不断发展
    新中国的儿童保健事业正在不断发展中。
    首先从保健机构方面来看：全国公立的妇产科医院、妇幼保健院、妇幼保健所以及公立和私立的妇幼保健站、民办的接生站等，在一九五二年二月的统计，共有一万九千二百多处，到一九五二年底已发展到三万四千多处。由省人民政府卫生厅组成的巡回工作的妇幼工作队，也由一九五一年的十二个发展到目前的二十一个。在全国刚解放的时候，国民党反动政府所办的儿童医院全国仅一所。目前全国公立的儿童医院已有五所，病床已较解放前增加了六倍。今年内将再增建一、二所，病床将扩充到解放前的二十余倍。拿广州来说，全市十一个区现在都设立了妇幼中心保健站，站内有专业的产科医师，有手术设备，能解决一般的难产问题。在妇幼中心保健站的领导下，有二十五个地段成立了民办公助的妇幼保健站。站内有完备的接生药品和器械，有相当数量的产床和婴儿床。今年春天，该市郊区成立了二十个接生站，计划在下半年再建立三十个，加上原有的三十四个，几乎每个自然村都有接生站了，这样就可以基本上取消旧法接生。
    为了加强儿童保健工作和妇女保健工作，在有条件的城市中，已将各级人民政府卫生部门的妇幼保健业务机构分为儿童保健机构和妇女保健机构。去年在广州、杭州和西安等九个城市设立了儿童保健所。
    为了保障初生婴儿及产妇的安全和健康，全国解放以后人民政府即大力推行了新法接生。到一九五一年底为止，人民政府卫生部门配合民主妇女联合会训练了接生员及改造了旧产婆共十六万多人。到一九五二年底，受过训练的接生员及经改造的旧产婆已有二十六万人以上。这些接生员及经改造的旧产婆起了很大作用。山西省昔阳县三区的接生员张喜凤自一九五○年受训后，在两年中用新接生法接了四十九个婴孩，无一死亡。而她自己过去曾生过六个孩子，由于用老法接生，五个死于破伤风。人民政府还设置了贫产、难产的免费接生名额。今年设置了二百万名免费名额，较去年增加了很多倍。由于新法接生的推行，初生婴儿破伤风死亡率逐年减低。据北京、大连两地的调查，一九五二年内这两个城市未发生过初生婴儿死于破伤风的事例。
    免费接受防疫注射及预防接种的儿童也逐年增加。一九五一年注射白喉类毒素的儿童共计一百六十多万名。去年约注射了二百万名。关于卡介苗的接种，解放以来已接种了一百九十八万儿童。一九四九年仅在上海、北京、天津三地施行卡介苗接种，现在已在一百多个城市内施行。由于卡介苗注射手续繁复，所以还只能在部分有条件的城市中施行。今年将制造卡介苗口服剂。口服可免去复杂的注射手续。因此，今后施行接种的地区就可以扩大。口服剂所引起的局部反应也较注射剂轻。
    许多城市的儿童在每年儿童节都能享受一次免费健康检查，三年来已检查了一百多万名儿童。
    接受苏联先进经验的指导，今年人民政府卫生部门在儿童保健工作方面又增加了许多新的内容。中央人民政府卫生部正开始推行新育儿法，目前以预防麻疹、腹泻、感冒等儿童最易感染的疾病为主要内容。中央人民政府卫生部已编印了二十多种有关新育儿法的小册子，并准备配合民主妇女联合会训练一批妇女来协助宣传新育儿法。在一部分托儿所里，最近推行了用注射母亲血液的办法来减轻儿童患麻疹时的病情或推迟发病。北京市妇幼保健院正实验以组织疗法治疗婴儿最易得而且药石很难治愈的湿疹病。这些方法经初步实验后都有很好的效果，待进一步实验得出确切效果后，人民政府卫生部门将配合有关团体全面地推广这些苏联在儿童保健方面的先进经验。（新华社）
