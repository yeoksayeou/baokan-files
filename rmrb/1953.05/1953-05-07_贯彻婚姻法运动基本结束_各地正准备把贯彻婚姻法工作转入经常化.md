(Xinhua News Agency report) The large-scale campaign to publicize and implement the Marriage Law, which unfolded successively across the country in February and March this year, has now basically concluded.

This movement, in terms of its breadth and depth, is the most systematic and unprecedented in scale since the founding of New China. In areas where the publicity work for the Marriage Law was done well, it has basically reached every household and deeply penetrated people's hearts, and has initially played a role in changing customs and habits. In the North China region, 80% of the villages in Hebei Province, 50% of the villages in Shanxi Province, and one-half of the villages in the agricultural area of ​​Suiyuan Province have conducted extensive publicity. In the East China region, movements were vigorously carried out in more than 60% of the areas. In Fujian Province, nearly 80% of the areas had masses who received Marriage Law education, accounting for 65% to 80% or more of the total population. In the Central South region, the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi carried out movements in 70% to 90% of the areas. In Wuhan City, more than 90% of adults in 40% of the streets received Marriage Law education. After such a large-scale publicity campaign, the broad masses of people have a correct understanding of the Marriage Law and this Marriage Law implementation campaign, and people of all ages generally support the Marriage Law.

In areas where the movement has been carried out better, the phenomenon of being killed or committing suicide due to marriage problems has been basically stopped or significantly reduced. In Wuhu City, Anhui Province, women often committed suicide in the past. During the movement, due to in-depth publicity of the Marriage Law, 15 women's suicide attempts were prevented. With the establishment of an atmosphere of equality between men and women and family harmony, women in many areas are no longer subjected to cruel abuse in the family. Some men whose patriarchal ideas have not been completely eliminated have also changed their attitude towards their wives under the condemnation and supervision of public opinion.

Through this movement, in some areas, the feudal marriage system has begun to be destroyed, and freedom of marriage has begun to form a social trend. According to incomplete statistics from the three special districts of Tianjin, Baoding, and Tangshan, and the two cities of Xuanhua and Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province, more than 9,200 couples freely married and more than 500 couples dissolved their marriage contracts due to dissatisfaction with arranged marriages during the Marriage Law implementation month. In Shenyang City, 1,213 couples also married independently in March. Before the movement, there were only four independent marriages in Yaojiayuan Village, a suburb of Beijing, in two years. After the movement, more than 20 young people found satisfactory partners in just one month, and four of them have already married. The publicity of the Marriage Law has also changed the thinking of many elderly people, causing them to give up the idea of ​​arranging marriages for their children. In Dehe Village, Jiaohe County, and Shaheqiao Village, Dunhua County, Jilin Province, six or seven young couples had independent marriages. In the past, they were interfered with by their families, but now the elderly are busy preparing weddings for their children. After receiving education on the Marriage Law, the broad masses of people began to establish the idea of ​​freedom of marriage and equality between men and women. Based on this, the disharmony between many couples and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law caused by the old society has changed in many areas, and thousands upon thousands of new democratic, harmonious, and united families have emerged. After this movement in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, 1,770 households improved the relationship between couples and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in the old families, and more than 350 couples were commended. In Jianyang County, Fujian Province, there were originally 589 disharmonious families. After publicizing the Marriage Law, 569 families transformed and became harmonious, of which 50 were elected as models in the county. In the eighth district of Chaoyi County, Shaanxi Province, 85 couples who had been arguing all year round became couples who respected and loved each other during the movement month, and many people regarded "consulting each other" as the "law of managing the family" in the future.

The publicity of the Marriage Law has begun to change people's feudal thinking of valuing men over women, thereby stimulating the enthusiasm of women to participate in various social activities, and their political status has also been improved. In the first district of Guihua City, 358 women who never attended meetings now participate in reading groups and often attend various meetings. In Yangzhou City, the South City District alone saw the emergence of 270 women activists during this movement. More than 80 women in Xiaomaluqian Street, Tianjin City, who never participated in social activities, are now actively requesting to participate in street work and literacy classes and drama troupes. The implementation of the Marriage Law has also promoted the enthusiasm of women to learn culture. In Tianqiao Township, Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, more than 200 women participated in accelerated literacy classes after the movement.

This campaign to publicize and implement the Marriage Law has also played a significant role in promoting industrial and agricultural production. In many areas, the enthusiasm for production of male and female workers and farmers has been better brought into play after they have gained freedom of marriage or resolved family disputes. Li Changping, foreman of the electrolysis workshop of the Dagukou Branch of the state-owned Tianjin Chemical Plant, and Liu Junming, chairman of the workshop trade union, greatly improved their production enthusiasm during this movement due to the improvement of the relationship between their mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law at home. Under the leadership of the two, the workers of the entire workshop put forward the slogan "Celebrate the victory of the Marriage Law implementation campaign with practical actions" and jointly developed a "sedimentation diaphragm method," which can double the service life of all electrolytic cells in the workshop, saving more than 90 million yuan annually. Zhang Daoyi and Wang Guizhen, workers at the Shenyang No. 7 Machinery Factory, had been in love for a long time. After this movement, with the support of the masses, they dared to interact openly. Encouraged by the workers and his fiancée, Zhang Daoyi researched and improved tools, increasing output by three times. The family of Sun Fuxiang, a turner in the factory, was not harmonious in the past, which affected his lack of focus on production. This movement changed his family situation, Sun Fuxiang was very happy, and conscientiously led the 17 technicians in the group to find 12 "tricks," completing the March production task four days ahead of schedule, and reducing the scrap rate from 5.3% to 2.8%. In the vast rural areas, the implementation of the Marriage Law has changed people's feudal thinking of discriminating against women and attracted many women to actively participate in labor production. In Songtai Village, Beizhen County, Liaoxi Province, the number of women participating in production increased from 12 last year to 72 this year due to the criticism of the idea of ​​male superiority over female and the correction of the wrong practice of unequal pay for equal work between men and women. Under the same circumstances, more than 90 women in Wangmanzi Village, Jin County, in the same province, participated in mutual aid groups, and 107 women participated in labor such as seed selection, grain delivery, and beating Zha seeds. Twenty-eight mutual aid groups that collapsed last year in the village were restored after the implementation of the Marriage Law. In the past, very few young and middle-aged women in Qinjiagang Township, a suburb of Chongqing, participated in agricultural labor. This year, more than 90% of them participated in mutual aid groups during the spring plowing and worked like men. The production enthusiasm of the farmers in the township is also much higher than in previous years. Up to now, 80% of the farmers have voluntarily signed up to participate in the production increase competition. In the past, women in Liangwan Township, Lingling County, Hunan Province, rarely participated in field labor. After this movement, women accounted for more than one-half of the more than 1,900 work days for repairing ponds in the township.

From a national perspective, the above-mentioned achievements are limited to areas where the Marriage Law implementation work has been done well, and the proportion of such better areas in the country is not very large. Based on general conditions to estimate the effect of the Marriage Law implementation campaign in various regions, it can be roughly divided into three types: better, average, and poor. Among the areas in Fujian Province where the Marriage Law was implemented, better areas accounted for more than 32%, average areas accounted for more than 45%, and poorer areas accounted for less than 23%. Other provinces and regions have similar situations. At the same time, the experience of this Marriage Law implementation campaign has also proved that carrying out such a huge social reform work and destroying the feudal marriage system and the feudal ideas in people's minds, which have existed deeply rooted for thousands of years, is a long-term and arduous process. Therefore, in order to consolidate the results of this movement and further implement the Marriage Law in the future, various regions are currently conducting serious inspections and summaries of the work of this Marriage Law implementation month and adopting various effective and feasible methods to transform the work of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law into a regular basis.

### 贯彻婚姻法运动基本结束  各地正准备把贯彻婚姻法工作转入经常化

    贯彻婚姻法运动基本结束
    各地正准备把贯彻婚姻法工作转入经常化
    据新华社讯：今年二三月份在全国范围内先后展开的大规模宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动，现已基本结束。
    这次运动，就它的广度和深度来说，都是新中国成立以来有系统的、规模空前的一次宣传贯彻婚姻法运动。在婚姻法的宣传工作做得好的地区，基本上已做到家喻户晓，深入人心，并且初步起到移风易俗的作用。华北区的河北省百分之八十的村庄，山西省百分之五十的村庄，绥远省农业区二分之一的村庄，都进行了广泛的宣传。华东区在百分之六十以上的地区，大张旗鼓地开展了运动。福建省有将近百分之八十的地区，受到婚姻法教育的群众占人口总数的百分之六十五到百分之八十以上。中南区河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省，在百分之七十到九十的地区内开展了运动，武汉市在百分之四十的街道中有百分之九十以上的成年人受到婚姻法的教育。经过这样大规模的宣传，广大群众对婚姻法和这次贯彻婚姻法运动都有了正确的认识，男女老少普遍拥护婚姻法。
    在运动开展得较好的地区，因婚姻问题而被杀或自杀的现象已基本上被制止或显著地减少。安徽省芜湖市过去经常发生妇女自杀现象，运动中由于深入宣传婚姻法，制止了十五起妇女自杀事件。随着男女平等、家庭和睦的风气的树立，许多地区的妇女在家庭中已不再受到残酷的虐待，有些夫权统治思想仍未彻底消除的男人，在群众舆论的指责和监督下，也改变了对妻子的态度。
    经过这次运动，在部分地区，封建婚姻制度已开始被摧毁，婚姻自由已开始形成一种社会风气。据河北省天津、保定、唐山三专区及宣化、秦皇岛两市的不完全统计，在这次贯彻婚姻法运动月中，有九千二百多对男女自由结了婚，还有五百多对男女因不满包办婚姻而解除了婚约。沈阳市在三月份内也有一千二百一十三对男女自主结婚。北京市郊姚家园村在运动前，两年内只有四对自主婚姻，运动后仅一个月内，就有二十多对青年找到满意的对象，其中有四对已经结了婚。婚姻法的宣传也改变了许多老年人的思想，使他（她）们放弃了包办儿女婚姻的念头。吉林省蛟河县德和村和敦化县沙河桥村各有六七对青年男女的自主婚姻，过去受到家庭的干涉，现在老年人都张罗着为儿女们办喜事了。广大群众在受到婚姻法的教育后，开始树立了婚姻自由、男女平等的思想，在这个基础上，旧社会所造成的许多夫妻、婆媳间不和睦的现象在许多地区已有了改变，出现了千千万万民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭。辽东省宽甸县经过这次运动，有一千七百七十户改善了旧家庭的夫妻、婆媳关系，有三百五十多对夫妇受到了表扬。福建省建阳县原有五百八十九户不和睦的家庭，经过宣传婚姻法后，转变和睦的有五百六十九户，其中有五十户并当选为全县的模范。陕西省朝邑县第八区在运动月中有八十五对常年吵架的夫妻变成了互相敬爱的夫妻，许多人都把“遇事商量”作为今后的“治家之法”。
    婚姻法的宣传开始改变了人们重男轻女的封建思想，从而发挥了广大妇女参加各种社会活动的积极性，她们的政治地位也随着有了提高。归绥市第一区有三百五十八个从来不参加会的妇女，现在都参加了读报组，并经常出席各种会议。扬州市仅城南一个区在这次运动中就涌现了妇女积极分子二百七十人。天津市小马路前街有八十多个从来不参加社会活动的妇女，现在纷纷要求参加街道工作和识字班、话剧团。贯彻婚姻法运动也推动了广大妇女学习文化的热情。安徽省桐城县添桥乡在运动后，有二百多个妇女参加了速成识字班。
    这次宣传贯彻婚姻法运动对于工农业生产也起了显著的推动作用，不少地区的男女工人和农民在得到婚姻自由或解决了家庭纠纷问题后，生产积极性都得以更好地发挥出来。国营天津化学工厂大沽分厂电解车间工长李长平、车间工会主席刘俊明两人，在这次运动中由于家中的婆媳关系得到改善，生产情绪大大提高，在他两人带头下，全车间工人提出了“以实际行动庆祝贯彻婚姻法运动的胜利”的口号，共同研究出一种“沉淀隔膜法”，可使车间所有电解槽的使用期限延长一倍，每年可节约九千多万元。沈阳第七机械厂工人张道一和王桂珍恋爱很久，在这次运动后得到群众支持才敢公开来往，张道一在工人们和未婚妻的鼓励下，研究改进工具，使产量提高了三倍。该厂车工孙福祥家过去不和睦，影响他无心生产，这次运动使他的家庭有了转变，孙福祥心中非常高兴，认真领导全组十七名技工找到十二个“窍门”，提前四天完成了三月份生产任务，废品率由百分之五点三降到百分之二点八。在广大农村中，贯彻婚姻法运动改变了人们歧视妇女的封建思想，吸引很多妇女积极地参加劳动生产。辽西省北镇县宋台村由于批判了男尊女卑的思想，纠正了男女同工不同酬的错误做法，参加生产的妇女由去年的十二人增加到七十二人。该省锦县王蛮子村在同样情况下有九十多个妇女参加了互助组，并有一百零七个妇女参加选种、送粮、打楂子等劳动，该村去年垮台的二十八个互助组在贯彻婚姻法运动后又恢复了二十三个。重庆市郊覃家岗乡过去很少参加农业劳动的青壮年妇女，今年春耕中百分之九十以上都参加了互助组，和男子一样劳动；全乡农民的生产积极性也比往年高得多，到现在，已有百分之八十的农民自动报名参加增产竞赛。湖南省零陵县良湾乡的妇女过去很少参加田间劳动，这次运动后，全乡修塘的一千九百多个工中，妇女出的工就占二分之一以上。
    从全国范围来看，上述这些成绩的取得还只限于贯彻婚姻法工作做得较好的地区，而这种较好的地区在全国所占比重也不是很大。根据一般情况来估计各地贯彻婚姻法运动的效果，大体上可分为较好、一般与较差三种类型。在福建省进行贯彻婚姻法的地区中，较好地区占百分之三十二强，一般地区占百分之四十五强，较差地区占百分之二十三弱。其他省区也都有类似情况。同时，这次贯彻婚姻法运动的经验也证明，要进行这样一件巨大的社会改革工作，要摧毁千百年来根深蒂固地存在的封建婚姻制度和人们头脑中的封建思想，是一个长期的艰巨的过程。因此，为了巩固这次运动的成果，以便今后进一步贯彻婚姻法，目前各地都正在对这次贯彻婚姻法运动月的工作进行认真的检查和总结，采取各种有效而可行的方法，以便把宣传贯彻婚姻法的工作转入经常化。
