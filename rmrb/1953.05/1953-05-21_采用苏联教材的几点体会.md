Several Experiences in Adopting Soviet Textbooks
Northwest Agricultural College Academic Affairs Office

After the ideological remolding study movement last year, the teachers of Northwest Agricultural College criticized the corrupt bourgeois ideology and erroneous viewpoints in the textbooks and universally and urgently demanded to learn from the advanced Soviet experience. In order to improve the quality of teaching, among the 120 courses in the entire college, in the last semester, three courses completely adopted Soviet textbooks; 13 courses mainly used Soviet textbooks, appropriately combined with the Chinese situation, and supplemented with some Chinese teaching materials; 98 courses were based on the old teaching materials, fragmentarily absorbing some advanced Soviet experience and Chinese materials for supplementation and modification; and six courses had basically no major changes in the teaching materials.

In adopting Soviet textbooks, we have the following experiences:

I. Soviet textbooks have a high degree of political and ideological character. In the introduction to each course in the Soviet Union, it is clearly pointed out: the political task that this course undertakes in national construction; the purpose of learning this course is to solve what problems in national construction; and what is the policy of the Soviet Socialist state regarding this course. This closely integrates science and technology with politics, embodying the spirit of technology serving politics. According to this spirit, we have also begun to pay attention to the content of political ideology in some courses and have received good results. For example, in botany, freshman students who have just entered school are generally not interested in botany because they have no understanding of learning agriculture. According to the spirit of the Soviet teaching syllabus, the teacher proposed that plants are an inexhaustible treasure in the agricultural production of the motherland, and that our study of plants is to discover the laws of plant development, understand them, and use them to serve agricultural production. Soviet scientists, using this principle, under the guidance of the Michurin doctrine, creatively hybridized Elymus and wheat to obtain perennial wheat, which played a significant role in agricultural production. If we do not pay attention to botany, and do not study and utilize them, Elymus will still exist naturally as a wild weed, and we will not be able to produce perennial wheat to benefit mankind. After such an explanation, the students' interest in learning botany was increased, guiding them to embark concretely on the road of studying for the motherland.

II. Soviet textbooks completely and distinctly run through dialectical materialism, and its struggle against the idealistic concepts in bourgeois doctrines is resolute and clear. Adopting Soviet textbooks will enable teachers to understand how to proceed from reality, how to understand the laws of the development of objective things, and how to expose the reactionary idealistic concepts of the bourgeoisie in the field of science. For example, in the textbook on Darwinism, it correctly points out the general tasks of biological science. From the perspective of the tasks of this course, we know that teachers have a responsibility to expose and prove the dialectics of natural development within nature itself. For example, bourgeois idealists believe that soil is a dead thing like stone, but the Soviet Williams used the materialist dialectical viewpoint to explain that soil is a living, organic body with life, and like animals and plants, it has the laws of continuous growth and development. The decomposition of soil organic matter plays a significant role in the growth and development of plants, and the growth of plants affects the development of the soil. By mastering this dialectical relationship, we can maintain the soil's abundant fertility and continuously supply the nutrients needed by crops to nourish and propagate them. Soviet agriculture has used this law to achieve brilliant achievements. Our college's "Soil Science" adopted Soviet textbooks, so everyone has a more correct understanding of the formation of soil, realizing that a certain soil is generated under a certain plant community. On Mount Taibai, we saw that on the parent material weathered from rocks, mosses initially grew, then transitioned to a mixed area of mosses and weeds, and finally the mosses were completely replaced by weeds. When the weeds enriched the organic matter and nutrients in the soil, forests appeared in these areas where weeds had grown. Under the influence of the forest, the soil underwent a process of podzolization, and finally formed podzolic soil. These situations can be seen very clearly on Mount Taibai. This correctly and dialectically explains that the formation of soil is the result of biological action, not simply caused by weathering. Educating students with such materials enables them to establish a correct understanding of soil and understand how to use its laws to serve agricultural production. When students went to Ningxia to investigate state-owned farms, they understood how to raise and study soil problems from the perspective of biological action, which shows that Soviet textbooks have played a certain role in their learning.

III. Soviet textbooks are closely linked to theory and practice, with clear purpose, rigorous systematicness, and extensive connections. Because Soviet textbooks have a clear purpose, the content is very concise and practical. However, in the past, veterinary pharmacology not only taught students about the medicinal doses for livestock, but also taught the medicinal doses for humans; plant chemical protection not only taught the medicinal doses for preventing plant diseases and insect pests, but sometimes also taught the medicinal doses for humans. With Soviet textbooks, it is not necessary to spend a lot of students' energy on blind and impractical things, so a course that used to take a semester to complete can now be taught in four weeks. Another feature of Soviet textbooks is their extensive connectivity, which is also very different from textbooks in capitalist countries. Textbooks in capitalist countries often have a one-sidedness, fragmenting the integrity of science. Those who study soil don't understand cultivation, and those who study crops don't care about soil. This is a common situation. The formation and development of soil are closely related to microorganisms, but those who study soil rarely study microorganisms; those who teach plant pathology only pay attention to wide rows and large ridges for wheat, increasing ventilation and sunshine to inhibit the occurrence of germs, without thinking about how to implement correct farming systems and use advanced farming techniques to promote the healthy growth of wheat and enhance its own disease resistance to obtain high yields.

Because Soviet textbooks have a high degree of political and ideological character and a clear dialectical materialist viewpoint, the adoption of Soviet textbooks must first continuously improve the political and professional level of teachers. Without the correct stand, viewpoint, and method, and without consciously and firmly learning advanced Soviet science and technology, it is impossible to adopt Soviet textbooks well.

Secondly, teachers must regularly and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and constantly improve their theoretical level in order to correctly understand and apply Soviet textbooks. For example, the first chapter of soil improvement science is written from the perspective of Marxism; without a certain level of Marxist-Leninist theory, it is not easy to understand thoroughly. The theories of Michurin and Pavlov are also permeated with dialectical materialist viewpoints, and it is difficult for those who lack dialectical materialist viewpoints to understand these theories. The process of learning Soviet scientific theories is a process of struggle between materialism and idealism, and a process of detailed and in-depth criticism of the bourgeoisie and other erroneous ideas. In many sciences, there are two different concepts of idealism and materialism, such as the source of "numbers" in mathematics. Idealists say that God created them, while materialists say that humans created them in their life practice; Lenin said a lot about the problems of idealism and materialism in physics in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism." If the materialist viewpoint cannot be truly established in the practical observation of problems, the favorable conditions for learning from the Soviet Union will be lost. Therefore, continuously improving the level of Marxism-Leninism and the level of science and technology has become the key to adopting advanced Soviet textbooks.

Because Soviet textbooks are closely linked to theory and practice and serve production and construction, we must strengthen the connection between teachers and practice when adopting advanced Soviet textbooks. Generally speaking, teachers have more rational knowledge and less perceptual knowledge. Through contact with practice, on the one hand, they can increase teachers' perceptual knowledge, and on the other hand, they can verify the role of advanced theories in practice, thereby strengthening teachers' interest and confidence in adopting Soviet textbooks. For example, one teacher saw in a Soviet textbook that "shallow plowing should be carried out simultaneously with wheat harvesting," and that "the law of wheat field plowing is shallow first, then deep, and then shallow again." At first, he did not completely believe it. Later, at a labor model meeting, he heard an agricultural production labor model describe their method of plowing as: "The first pass breaks the skin, the second pass vigorously plows, the third pass is for weeding, and the fourth pass is just messing around (meaning perfunctorily plowing)." He also said, "Shallow plowing should be early, the earlier the better." On another occasion, teachers visited vegetable farmers in Wugong, Shaanxi, and found that the yield of cabbage seeds using the dense planting method was ten times higher than the yield stated in the books, and this dense planting method is a commonly used Soviet method. These illustrate that the excellent experiences explored by farmers in long-term production are completely in line with scientific principles. These materials made the teachers realize that Soviet textbooks are indeed linked to practice, thereby strengthening their requirements for adopting Soviet textbooks and linking them to practice; on the other hand, it also confirmed that Soviet textbooks have a great guiding role in agricultural production.

Finally, precisely because our ideological and professional levels are not high enough, our ability to read Russian professional books is not enough, and Russian books and translated materials are insufficient, we cannot impatiently complete the task of learning from the Soviet Union as a blitzkrieg, but must adopt the policy of preparing conditions and advancing steadily. First, we must choose a key science for comprehensive and systematic study to find a way to learn from the Soviet Union, and then fully expand. For agricultural colleges, if Darwinism and Michurin genetics are not well studied, and if Mendel, Morgan, and Weismann cannot be refuted, then learning from advanced Soviet experience will become empty talk. Therefore, for two years, we have seized every opportunity to send teachers to Beijing three times to learn from Soviet experts, so we have the conditions to launch a college-wide study of Darwinism and Michurin genetics. This method has been effective from our past experience and today's situation.

    采用苏联教材的几点体会
    西北农学院教务处
    西北农学院的教师们，在去年思想改造的学习运动后，批判了教材中资产阶级的腐朽思想及错误观点，普遍而迫切地要求学习苏联先进经验。为了提高教学质量，在全院一百二十门课程中，上学期完全采用苏联教材的有三门课程；以苏联教材为主，适当地结合中国情况，补充一部分中国教材的有十三门课程；以旧有的教材为基础，片断地吸收一些苏联先进经验和中国的资料进行补充修改的有九十八门课程；教材基本上无大变动的有六门课程。
    在采用苏联教材方面，我们有以下几点体会：
    一、苏联教材有高度的政治思想性。在苏联每一门课程的绪论中，都明确地指出：这一门课程在国家建设中所担负的政治任务；学习这门课程的目的，是为了解决国家建设中什么问题；苏维埃社会主义国家对于和这门课程有关的政策是什么。这样就使科学技术和政治密切结合起来，体现了技术为政治服务的精神。根据这样的精神，我们在某些课程中也开始注意了政治思想性的内容，并收到了很好的效果。比如植物学，刚入学的一年级同学，由于对学农没有认识，所以一般对植物学不感兴趣。教师根据苏联教学大纲的精神，提出植物是祖国农业生产中的无尽宝藏，我们学习植物就是为了发现植物发展的规律，认识它们，利用它们来为农业生产服务。苏联科学家运用这个原理，在米丘林学说指导之下，创造性地用鹅冠草和小麦进行杂交育种，得出多年生的小麦，在农业生产上起了很大的作用。如果我们不重视植物学，不去研究和利用它们，鹅冠草依然作为野生杂草而自然存在，就不能产生多年生小麦而造福人类。这样讲解后，就提高了同学们对植物学的学习兴趣，引导同学具体地走上为祖国而学习的道路。
    二、苏联教材完整地、鲜明地贯串着辩证唯物主义，它对资产阶级学说中的唯心观念的斗争是坚决的、明确的。采用了苏联教材，就会使教师懂得如何从实际出发，如何认识客观事物发展的规律，如何揭露资产阶级在科学领域中的反动唯心观念。如在达尔文主义的教材中，就正确地指出了生物科学的一般任务。从这一课程的任务上看，就知道教师有责任在自然界本身里面，来揭发并证明自然发展的辩证法。比如资产阶级唯心观念者，认为土壤和石头一样是死的东西，但苏联威廉士用唯物辩证的观点说明了土壤是一个活的有生命的有机体，它和动物、植物一样有着不断生长发育的规律。土壤有机物的分解，对于植物的生长发育起很大的作用，植物的生长又影响着土壤的发育。我们掌握了这种辩证发展的关系，就可以使土壤保持充沛的肥力，源源不断地供给农作物所需的养料，来滋长和繁殖。苏联的农业就利用了这个规律，获得辉煌的成就。本院“土壤学”采用了苏联教材，因而大家对于土壤的形成有了更正确的认识，认识到在一定的植物群社之下生成一定的土壤。我们在太白山上看到了岩石风化后的母质上，最初生长着苔藓植物，而后过渡到苔藓和杂草的混生地带，最后苔藓完全被杂草代替，当杂草丰富了土壤中的有机物及营养元素之后，就在这些长过杂草的地区上出现了森林。土壤在森林的影响下，进行着灰化作用，最后形成了灰化土。这些情况在太白山上完全可以看得很清楚。这就正确而辩证地说明了土壤的形成是由于生物作用的结果，不是简单风化作用所造成的。用这样的材料教育学生，就使学生树立了对土壤的正确认识，并了解到如何利用其规律为农业生产服务。当同学们到宁夏去查勘国营农场时，对土壤问题，就懂得从生物作用的观点上来提出问题，研究问题，这说明苏联教材已在他们的学习上起了一定的作用。
    三、苏联教材是理论和实际密切联系的，具有明确的目的性、严密的系统性及广泛的联系性。由于苏联教材有明确的目的性，因此在内容上就很精练而切合实用。但是，过去的兽医药物学，不但教给学生关于家畜的药用量，也教人的药用量；教植物化学保护，不仅教植物防病防虫的药用量，有时也教人的药用量。用了苏联教材，就可以不必把学生的许多精力化费到盲目的、不切实用的地方，所以过去一学期的课程，现在四个星期就教完了。苏联教材的另一个特点是具有广泛的联系性，这也是和资本主义国家的教材大大不同的。资本主义的教材常常带有片面性，把科学的整体性割裂得支离破碎。学土壤的不懂耕作，学作物的不管土壤，这是一种普遍的情况。土壤的生成和发育，和微生物是有密切联系的，但是学土壤的就很少研究微生物；教植物病理的只注意于小麦宽行大垅，增加通风日照，以不利于病菌的发生，就没有想到如何实行正确的耕作制度和运用先进的耕作技术，促使小麦健壮的生长，增强本身的抗病能力以取得丰产。
    由于苏联教材具有高度的政治思想性，具有明确的辩证唯物主义的观点，因此采用苏联教材首先必须不断地提高教师的政治水平和业务水平。没有正确的立场、观点和方法，不能自觉地坚定不移地学习苏联先进的科学和技术，就不可能很好地采用苏联教材。
    其次，教师要经常地系统地学习马克思列宁主义，不断提高理论水平，才能正确地理解和运用苏联教材。像土壤改良学第一章就是用马克思主义的观点来写的；如果没有一定的马克思列宁主义理论水平是不容易理解透彻的。米丘林、巴夫洛夫的学说也都渗透着唯物辩证的观点，缺乏唯物辩证观点的人，就很难懂得这些学说。学习苏联科学理论的过程，就是唯物论和唯心论斗争的过程，就是对资产阶级以及其他错误思想进行细致而深入的批判的过程。在许多科学中都遇到唯心论和唯物论两种不同的观念，如数学上“数”的来源，唯心论者说是上帝造的，唯物论者说是人类在生活实践中创造出来的；物理学上的唯心论和唯物论问题，列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”中说得很多了。如果不能把唯物论的观点真正地在实际观察问题中建立起来，就失掉学习苏联的有利条件。因此，继续不断地提高马克思列宁主义水平和科学技术水平，已成为采用苏联先进教材的关键。
    由于苏联教材是理论密切联系实际的，是为生产建设服务的，因此我们采用苏联先进教材，必须加强教师对实际的联系。一般地说，教师们的理性知识较多，感性知识较少，通过和实际的联系，一方面可以增加教师的感性知识，另一方面又可验证先进理论在实际中的作用，从而加强教师对采用苏联教材的兴趣和信心。如一位教师看到苏联教材中说，“浅耕要随麦收同时进行”，“麦地整地的规律是先浅、后深、再浅”，开始时他并不是完全相信的，后来在一次劳动模范会上，听到农业生产劳动模范叙述他们整地的方法是：“头遍铲破皮，二遍狠扎犁，三遍是锄草的，四遍是胡搞呢（按即马马虎虎整一下的意思）。”又说：“浅耕要早，越早越好。”又有一次教师们去陕西武功访问菜农，发现白菜种株用密植的方法，种籽的产量比书本上说的产量高十倍，而这种密植的方法就是苏联常用的方法。这些说明农民在长期生产中摸索出来的优良经验，是完全符合科学原理的。这些材料，使教师们认识到苏联教材确实是联系实际的，从而加强了他们采用苏联教材和联系实际的要求；另一方面，也证实了苏联教材对于农业生产有着极大的指导作用。
    最后，正因为我们的思想和业务水平还不高，阅读俄文专业书籍的能力还不够，俄文书籍和翻译资料还不足，所以我们不能急躁地把学习苏联当作突击任务去完成，而必须采取准备条件，稳步前进的方针，首先选择一门带有关键性的科学，进行全面地、系统的学习，找出学习苏联的途径，然后再全面展开。就农学院来说，如果达尔文主义和米丘林遗传学搞不好，不能把孟德尔、摩尔根、威士曼驳倒，那么学习苏联先进经验必将流于空谈。因此，两年来我们就抓住所有机会先后三次派教师到北京向苏联专家学习，因此我们就有条件展开全院性的达尔文主义和米丘林遗传学的学习。这个方法，从我们过去的经验和今天的情况来看是有效的。
