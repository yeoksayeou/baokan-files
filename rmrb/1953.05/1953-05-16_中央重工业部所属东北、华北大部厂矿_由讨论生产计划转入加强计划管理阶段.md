Striving to Formulate Advanced Production Plans

    Northeast and North China Factories and Mines Under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Shift from Discussing Production Plans to Strengthening Planning Management

    The work of factories and mines under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry in mobilizing employees to discuss the 1953 production plan and strengthen planning management is being actively carried out. As of early May, the work of discussing production plans in most factories and mines in the Northeast and North China regions has come to an end, and they are now shifting to the stage of strengthening planning management.

    In the factories and mines of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the Northeast region, with the exception of units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Benxi Iron and Steel Company which are still discussing production plans, cement and glass factories in the building materials industry system have discussed quotas and formulated plans to strive to complete these quotas. Northeast Fifth and Sixth Cement Plants have already signed collective contracts. Shenyang Smelter in the non-ferrous metal industry system has formulated guarantee measures for completing the plan based on mobilizing the masses to find shortcuts and tap potential; collective contracts have been signed. Factory 401 is also brewing the signing of collective contracts after the discussion of plan targets is over. Some units have ended the discussion of plan targets and are now starting to strengthen planning management and formulate operational plans. Chemical industry factories and Dalian Iron and Steel Plant are all starting to strengthen planning management.

    In most factories and mines of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in North China, the work of discussing production plans has also ended. Tangshan Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Yangquan Iron Mine, Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, and Longyan Iron Mine in the steel industry system have all discussed quotas. Tianjin Steel Plant has rectified the original records and started to formulate operational plans. Tianjin Chemical Plant, Dye Factory and other units in the chemical industry system are actively preparing to strengthen planning management after discussing quotas. Taiyuan Cement Plant has done a better job in discussing plans in the building materials industry system. At the beginning, the plant mobilized employees to expose many important problems, and both leaders and employees had a clear understanding. As a result of the plan discussion, cement production can exceed the national plan by 7.68 percent, and the cost can be reduced by 3.74 percent compared with the national plan. The plant began to strengthen planning management from mid-April.

    Some factories and mines of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the Southwest region, such as Factories 101 and 102, have discussed the production plan for the second quarter, but have not yet mobilized the masses to fully discuss the annual plan targets. The factories and mines of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the East China region will soon end the wage review work and quickly start discussing the national plan. Some units, such as Yongli Ning Plant and Shanghai Smelter, have mobilized the masses, and Xinhu Steel Plant and Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's First Plant have formulated action plans to mobilize the masses. In the factories and mines in the Central South region, such as Daye Plant of Huazhong Iron and Steel Company, preparations for discussing the plan have begun.

    Judging from the actual situation of various factories and mines, there are still some serious shortcomings in some factories and mines that have already discussed production plans. For example, the Northeast Second Glass Factory found a relatively common tendency of formalism in the review of the discussed plan. The guarantee plans of various production teams were not put forward for the key problems in the team. Although Yangquan Iron Mine has discussed plan targets, it still lacks specific improvement measures for key production issues. In addition, some units adopted a simple method of discussion and adoption in the work of discussing plans. Some units do not recognize the complexity of planning management and are preparing to complete the various systems of planning management in ten days. These situations show that although some factories and mines have ended the work of discussing plans, they have not really solved the problem, and they still lack specific methods to complete the plan; or although there are specific gains in discussing plan targets, there is still a lack of organizational system guarantees, so the gains of employees in the discussion of plan targets cannot be consolidated.

    Based on the above situation, the Ministry of Heavy Industry put forward the following requirements:

    1. All units that have ended or are nearing the end of the discussion of plan targets should concentrate their efforts to start and actively prepare for the construction of the planning management system. It is necessary to clearly recognize that strengthening planning management is the purpose of mobilizing employees to discuss the plan. Because only by strengthening planning management can the gains of the masses in discussing plan targets be consolidated. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize workers, technicians, and management personnel to expose the shortcomings of planning management and rely on them to comprehensively establish and improve various planning management systems.

    2. While concentrating efforts to strengthen planning management, the leadership should organize relevant departments to check whether the plans made by employees have practical guarantee measures, and must require each unit to formulate practical measures plans to ensure the completion of the plan.

    3. Units that have started to discuss or have not yet started to discuss the plan, the administrative leadership should clearly recognize that mobilizing employees to discuss the plan and strengthening planning management is the foundation for improving enterprise management and the central content of the current anti-bureaucracy struggle in the enterprise, and should seize the time to carry out the work of discussing the plan in depth. In the process of discussion, they should absorb existing experience, grasp the key problems in enterprise production, mobilize the masses to find shortcuts and put forward rationalization proposals, and make the plans discussed by employees have specific and practical guarantee measures.

### 中央重工业部所属东北、华北大部厂矿  由讨论生产计划转入加强计划管理阶段

    中央重工业部所属东北、华北大部厂矿
    由讨论生产计划转入加强计划管理阶段
    中央重工业部所属厂矿发动职工讨论一九五三年生产计划加强计划管理的工作，正在积极进行中。到五月上旬为止，东北、华北地区的大部厂矿，讨论生产计划的工作已告一段落，正转入加强计划管理工作的阶段。
    重工业部在东北地区的厂矿，除鞍山钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司等单位还在讨论生产计划外，建筑器材工业系统的水泥、玻璃工厂已讨论了定额，并制订出争取完成这一定额的计划。东北第五和第六两水泥厂已经在签订集体合同。有色金属工业系统的沈阳冶炼厂，在发动群众找窍门、挖潜力的基础上，订出了完成计划的保证措施；集体合同已经签订完毕。四○一厂在讨论计划指标阶段结束后，也在酝酿签订集体合同。某些单位已结束讨论计划指标的工作，正着手进行加强计划管理和制订作业计划的工作。化学工业各厂及大连钢铁厂等单位，都正着手加强计划管理工作。
    重工业部在华北地区的大部厂矿，讨论生产计划的工作也已结束。钢铁工业系统的唐山钢厂、天津钢厂、太原钢铁厂、阳泉铁厂、石家庄焦厂和龙烟铁厂，都已讨论了定额。天津钢厂已整顿好原始纪录，开始制订作业计划。化学工业系统的天津化工厂、染料厂等单位在讨论了定额后，正积极准备加强计划管理工作。建筑器材工业系统讨论计划的工作，以太原水泥厂做得较好。该厂一开始就发动职工揭发出不少重要的问题，领导干部和职工群众心中都有数了。讨论计划的结果，水泥产量可超过国家计划百分之七点六八，成本可比国家计划降低百分之三点七四。该厂从四月中旬就开始进行加强计划管理的工作。
    重工业部在西南地区的一部分厂矿，如一○一、一○二厂，已讨论了第二季度的生产计划，但是对全年各项计划指标还没有发动群众全面进行讨论。重工业部在华东地区的厂矿，即可结束工资复查工作，迅速开始讨论国家计划。有些单位如永利宁厂、上海冶炼厂等已发动了群众，新沪钢厂、上海钢铁公司第一厂已制订好发动群众的行动计划。在中南地区的厂矿，如华中钢铁公司大冶厂，已开始进行讨论计划的准备工作。
    从目前各厂矿的实际情况来看，有些已经讨论了生产计划的厂矿，还存在着若干严重的缺点。如东北第二玻璃厂对讨论后的计划进行复查的结果，发现了比较普遍的形式主义倾向，各生产小组的保证计划并不是针对组内关键问题提出来的。阳泉铁厂虽已讨论过计划指标，但对生产关键问题还缺乏具体的改进措施。另外有些单位在讨论计划的工作中采取了单纯的讨论通过的办法。有的单位不认识计划管理工作的复杂性，准备十天功夫就把计划管理工作的各项制度搞完。这些情况说明：某些厂矿虽然结束了讨论计划的工作，但是并没有真正解决问题，还缺乏完成计划的具体办法；或者虽然在讨论计划指标时有具体的收获，但是还缺乏组织制度方面的保证，因而职工群众在讨论计划指标阶段中的收获，也就无法巩固。
    重工业部根据以上情况，提出下面的几点要求：
    一、凡是讨论计划指标已经结束或接近结束的单位，都应集中力量着手进行和积极准备计划管理制度的建设工作，必须明确地认识到加强计划管理是发动职工讨论计划的目的。因为只有加强计划管理，才能把群众讨论计划指标时的收获巩固下来。因此，要发动工人、技术人员、管理人员揭发计划管理上的缺点，依靠他们把各项计划管理制度全面地建立和健全起来。
    二、在集中力量加强计划管理的同时，领导方面要组织有关部门，检查职工群众订出的计划有无切实的保证措施，一定要求各单位订出切实的保证完成计划的措施计划。
    三、开始讨论或尚未进行讨论计划的单位，行政领导方面应该明确认识发动职工群众讨论计划、加强计划管理工作是改进企业管理的基础，是当前在企业内进行反官僚主义斗争的中心内容，并应抓紧时间深入开展讨论计划的工作。在讨论的过程中，应吸取已有的经验，抓住企业生产中的关键问题，发动群众找窍门、提合理化建议，并要使经过职工群众讨论后的计划，有具体切实的保证措施。
