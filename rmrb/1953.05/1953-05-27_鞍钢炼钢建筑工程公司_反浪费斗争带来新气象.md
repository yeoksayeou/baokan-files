Anshan Iron and Steel's Steelmaking Construction Company
Anti-Waste Campaign Brings a New Atmosphere

[Our Newspaper] The anti-waste and responsibility system establishment campaign at Anshan Iron and Steel's Steelmaking Construction Company has entered the stage of focused, led exposure and in-depth analysis. Each unit, based on its actual situation, is exposing the main aspects of waste and lack of accountability, identifying the reasons, connecting them with ideology, and conducting criticism and self-criticism. In the past ten-plus days, the class consciousness of all employees, especially technical personnel, has generally increased, and their sense of responsibility has been generally strengthened. They have not only actively participated in the campaign, exposing and analyzing shortcomings, but also generally demanding the swift clarification of responsibilities and the formulation and implementation of a responsibility system. For example, when concrete team workers were examining the reasons for low efficiency, high waste, and poor quality, they all connected it to themselves, criticizing erroneous ideas such as "If wages don't increase, I'll waste," and "Idleness is a good rest." They eliminated the frequent loss of tools and breakage of light bulbs. Through serious study, they collectively created a "secondary grouting assembly line operation" method, increasing efficiency by more than double. Workers Ma Chaozhong and Qu Zhaoxiang, seeing bad weather on their way home from work, ran back to the site to cover the poured concrete pillars with grass bags to prevent rain from affecting the project quality. The steel and wood formwork team workers, while completing the main electrical room basement ventilation tunnel project, one of the major projects of the large rolling mill, devised many methods to overcome construction difficulties and completed the task six days ahead of schedule. The excavation team overfulfilled the earthwork project task by 40% in April and the backfilling task by 28%. These new atmospheres are also appearing among technical personnel and staff. For example, Wang Yujie, an engineer from the fifth construction section, when inspecting and analyzing the heating furnace project, carefully examined his attitude toward the campaign, from observation and waiting to active participation. He boldly criticized his past arrogance and unwillingness to clearly explain drawing requirements to the foremen and his reluctance to do specific work, which led to workers misaligning the lines and causing several reworks. He then actively participated in the leadership work of the campaign. An engineer from the third construction section, who rarely went to the site to solve problems in the past, has been helping workers solve problems on the site all day and even personally participating in cleaning work after receiving education from the campaign and conducting self-criticism. Due to the increased awareness of the staff, the technical supply section has undergone a new transformation in its work and new figures such as warehouse keeper Sheng Renyi, who love state property, have emerged. At 3:00 AM on the night of April 28th, it suddenly rained heavily. Sheng Renyi and another comrade rushed from home to the warehouse to cover all metal materials and cement, avoiding the loss of material deterioration due to warehouse leaks. Under the influence of his active actions, the warehouse keepers cleaned the warehouse very neatly and checked the weather before getting off work every day, then checked the warehouse to see if the tarpaulin or mat was tightly covered. After inspecting and analyzing the reasons for blind supply, the material clerks often took the initiative to go to the site, carefully calculating with engineers and foremen, strengthening the connection between the supply work and the construction site. They not only familiarized themselves with the site conditions and ensured timely supply, but also quickly discovered errors in the material budget, and began to avoid the phenomenon of insufficient supply of urgently needed materials and large stockpiles of unused materials.

The work of the Steelmaking Construction Company in the stage of focused exposure and analysis has the following characteristics:

1.  Repeatedly explain to employees that the purpose of focused exposure and analysis is to "clarify the situation, distinguish right from wrong, accept lessons, and improve ideology." It is not for "punishing certain people or getting rid of certain people"; it is to expose the serious shortcomings and errors existing in the work through mass criticism and self-criticism, in order to summarize experiences and lessons, and improve the management of capital construction, thereby eliminating various concerns of the masses and enabling them to take active action.

2.  Determine key issues and formulate a plan to carry out the campaign by summarizing past work and examining current work. The leadership conducted typical investigations on the one hand, and led the masses to discuss the plan on the other. When the masses realized that these shortcomings did exist in the past and present work, they naturally focused on the key issues for exposure and analysis. Combining this with typical investigations of key issues made the problems more comprehensive and specific, making it easier to analyze the reasons and learn from them.

3.  Engineers, veteran technicians, and employees with proficient skills handle many things, and most of them are critical tasks, so they know more about the situation and problems. If they are not mobilized, the campaign will not be easy to deepen. However, these comrades have great ideological concerns and also have opinions on the leadership. Therefore, leading cadres must sincerely and humbly listen to their opinions, care about their lives, trust their work, and improve their ideology, thereby strengthening ties with them. At the same time, absorb those proactive technical personnel, veteran technicians, or employees to participate in leadership work or serve as study group leaders to jointly study the campaign situation and the practice of leading the campaign, so that they can recognize the purpose of the campaign, change their "wait and see" attitude, and become the backbone of the campaign.

4.  Analyze and criticize ideologically in a realistic manner. First, organize the exposure materials and typical investigation materials, and then the material is enriched by a central speaker (the most familiar with the business, and who is in charge of this work) and several comrades who are more proficient in the business and have a thorough understanding of the key issues. The central speaker is responsible for clarifying the situation, then puts forward the main problems, analyzes them, connects them to the examination of ideology, finds out the reasons, and proposes improvement methods. The masses greatly welcome this practice, saying that it is convincing and truly solves problems ideologically. The comrades of the technical supply section call this approach "four feet on the ground."

    反浪费斗争带来新气象
    【本报讯】鞍钢炼钢建筑工程公司的反浪费与建立责任制运动，已经进入有领导地重点揭发和深入分析阶段。各单位根据实际情况，揭发浪费和无人负责现象的主要方面，找出原因，联系思想，开展批评与自我批评。十多天来，全体职工特别是技术人员的阶级觉悟普遍提高，责任心普遍加强。他们不仅积极投入了运动，对缺点进行揭发和分析，而且普遍要求迅速划清职责，制订责任制度，加以贯彻。如混凝土队的工人们在检查效率低、浪费大和质量不好的原因时，都联系自己批判了“工资不涨，我就浪费”、“窝工正好休息”等错误思想，消灭了经常丢失工具和打破灯泡的现象，并且经过认真研究，集体创造了“二次灌浆流水作业”的操作方法，提高效率一倍以上。工人马朝忠、曲兆祥在下班回家途中看见天色不好，就跑回现场用草袋子把所浇灌的混凝土柱子盖好，以免因雨淋而影响工程质量。钢筋木模队的工人们，在完成大型轧钢厂主要工程之一——主电室的地下室的通风洞工程时，想了许多办法，克服了施工困难；提前六天完成了任务。挖土队在四月份超额百分之四十完成土方工程任务，超额百分之二十八完成回填土任务。这些新气象同样出现在技术人员和职员方面。如第五工段工程师王玉洁，在检查和分析加热炉工程时，认真检查了自己对运动的态度，是由观望、等待到积极参加，并大胆批判了过去因自己骄傲自大，不屑于向领工员交代清楚图纸要求和不愿意做具体工作，以致工人放错了线，造成数次返工，最后积极参加了运动的领导工作。第三工段的一个工程师，过去很少下现场解决问题，但经过了运动的教育，进行了自我批评以后，整天都在现场里帮助工人解决问题，甚至亲自参加清扫工作。技术供应科，由于职工觉悟提高，工作面貌有了新的转变，并出现了像守库员生仁义等热爱国家财产的新人物。四月二十八日夜三点钟，忽然下大雨，生仁义和另一同志赶忙由家跑到仓库，把金属器材和水泥全部盖好，避免了因仓库漏雨造成材料变质的损失。在他的积极行动影响下，守库员们把仓库清理得很整洁，每天在下班前都要看看天色，然后到库内检查一遍油布或席子是否盖得严密。领料员们在检查并分析了盲目供应的原因以后，经常主动下现场，细心地和工程师、领工员核计，加强了供应工作和施工现场的联系，不但熟悉现场情况，保证及时供应，而且能够很快发现材料预算中的错误，开始避免了急用的材料供应不足、不用的材料大量积压的现象。
    炼钢建筑工程公司在重点揭发和分析阶段的工作，有如下几个特点：
    一、反复向职工说明重点揭发与分析的目的，是在于“弄清情况，分清是非，接受教训，提高思想。”并不是为了“要惩办哪些人或整掉哪些人”；是为了要经过群众性的批评与自我批评，揭露工作中所存在的严重缺点和错误，借以总结经验教训，改善基本建设的管理，因而消除了群众的各种顾虑，使他们积极行动起来。二、通过总结过去工作和检查当前工作确定重点问题，制订开展运动的计划。领导方面一面作典型调查，一面有领导地把计划交给群众讨论。群众认识到过去和目前工作中确实存在这些缺点，就很自然地围绕着重点问题进行揭发与分析。这样再结合重点问题的典型调查，使问题暴露得更全面而具体，如此就易于分析原因，从而取得教训。三、工程师、老技工和业务熟练的职员，经办的事情多，且多半都是带有关键性的工作，因而他们了解的情况和问题也多，如果不把他们发动起来，运动就不易深入。但是这些同志思想顾虑大，对领导也有意见。因而领导干部必须诚恳而虚心地倾听他们的意见，关心他们的生活，信任他们的工作，提高他们的思想，从而密切与他们的联系。同时，吸收那些主动积极的技术人员、老技工或职员参加领导工作或者当学习小组长，共同研究运动情况和领导运动的作法，使他们认清运动的目的，改变“观望”或“等待”态度，成为运动的骨干。四、实事求是地联系思想进行分析与批判。首先把揭发材料和典型调查材料整理出来，再由一个中心发言人（业务最熟悉的，而且是经手这一工作的）和几个业务上较熟练而且对重点问题了解较透彻的同志共同研究，把材料充实以后，由中心发言人负责把情况搞清，然后提出主要问题，进行分析，联系检查思想，找出原因，提出改进办法。群众非常欢迎这种做法，他们说这样做令人心服口服，真正从思想上解决问题。技术供应科的同志把这种做法叫做“四脚踏地”。
