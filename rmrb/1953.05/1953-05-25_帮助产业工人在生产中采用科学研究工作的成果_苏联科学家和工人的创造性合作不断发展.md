Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS, the creative cooperation between Soviet scientific workers and workers is constantly developing. Scientists are actively participating in solving important problems in designing new machines, summarizing advanced methods of innovators, and helping industrial workers adopt the achievements of scientific research in production.

    In Leningrad, the staff of the "Leningrad Soviet Technical Research Institute" has signed 117 cooperation contracts with many factories across the country. Last year, the institute conducted 95 scientific research projects and made 876 technical verifications. With the help of scientists, machine-building workers in Leningrad began manufacturing hundreds of new machines, tools, equipment, and instruments. Relying on the assistance of the Kalinin Comprehensive Technical Research Institute, the Sverdlov Machine Tool Factory manufactured a new type of lathe that is the largest and most efficient in the country. This lathe can manufacture turbine blades for the turbines of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations. Workers at the "Second Five-Year Plan Factory" have also completed many arduous tasks due to this cooperation. This factory will produce new machines capable of manufacturing color films, high-quality fibers, and cables, some of which have never been seen in the Soviet Union.

    In the Urals, the Kirov Comprehensive Technical Research Institute has been cooperating with many steel plants for more than four years. The Lower Salda Steel Plant recently requested the institute to help improve the efficiency of its furnaces. Personnel from the institute's steelmaking and gas engineering departments, in cooperation with the factory's engineers and Stakhanovite workers, improved the technology and thus solved the problem. The institute also regularly holds training courses to improve the skills of steelworkers. Steelworkers from Moscow, Leningrad, and the Soviet Far East come to participate in the training. After graduation, they often write to the institute's scientific workers, reporting on their work achievements and new technical developments, and requesting guidance from the scientific workers. The best steelworkers in the Urals often come to the institute to report on their advanced production methods.

    In the Donets Basin, nearly 2,000 engineers, technicians, and Stakhanovite workers from various steel plants participated in scientific research work. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, they have put forward many suggestions for technical innovation. Engineers from the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Stalino Steel Plant, in cooperation with researchers from the Donets Industrial Research Institute, summarized and improved the advanced steelworkers' high-speed steelmaking technology, enabling all open-hearth furnaces to adopt high-speed steelmaking methods for tapping. By saving time, the workshop staff can produce nearly 100 tons more steel per day with the same equipment than before.

    苏联科学家和工人的创造性合作不断发展
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联科学工作者和工人之间的创造性合作不断发展。科学家们正在积极地参加解决设计新机器的重要问题，总结革新者的先进方法，帮助产业工人在生产中采用科学研究工作的成果。
    在列宁格勒，“列宁格勒苏维埃技术研究所”的工作人员，已和全国许多工厂签订了一百一十七项合作合同。去年，这个研究所进行了九十五种科学研究工作，并作了八百七十六次技术检定。列宁格勒的机器制造工人在科学家的协助下，开始制造了几百种新的机器、工具、器械和仪器。斯维德洛夫母机制造工厂依靠加里宁综合技术研究所的帮助，制造了一种全国最大、效率最高的新式车床，这种车床可以为古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站制造透平的轮机翼。“第二个五年计划工厂”的工人也由于这种合作而完成了许多艰巨的任务。这个工厂将生产能制造彩色影片、上等纤维和电缆等的新式机器，其中有些机器在苏联是从来没有过的。
    在乌拉尔，基洛夫综合技术研究所和许多钢铁厂进行了四年以上的合作。下萨尔达钢铁厂最近曾要求该研究所帮助提高熔炉的效率。研究所的炼钢和煤气工程部门的人员，与这个工厂的工程师和斯大哈诺夫式工作者合作，改进了技术，因而解决了这个问题。研究所还定期举办提高炼钢工人技术的学习班。莫斯科、列宁格勒和苏联远东地区的炼钢工人都来参加学习。他们在毕业后还经常写信给研究所的科学工作者，报告他们的工作成就和技术方面的新发展，并要求科学工作者给予指导。乌拉尔最优秀的炼钢工人常常到研究所来报告他们先进的生产方法。
    在顿尼兹，各个钢铁厂有将近二千个工程师、技师和斯大哈诺夫工作者参加了科学研究工作。他们在第五个五年计划期间已提出了许多技术革新的建议。斯大林诺炼钢厂平炉间的工程师们，在顿尼兹工业研究所的研究员的合作下，总结并改进了先进钢铁工人的高速炼钢技术，使所有的平炉都能采用高速炼钢法出钢。由于节省了时间，车间的工作人员就可以用同样的设备每天生产比以前将近多一百吨的钢。
