    Five-Three Factory Strengthens Planning Management
    [This newspaper dispatch] The National Model Factory—Five-Three Factory is strengthening its planning management work on the original basis.
    Since 1951, the Five-Three Factory has gradually established and improved its planning management work. The level of enterprise management and production has been significantly improved. For several years, it has consistently overfulfilled its production tasks on a monthly and annual basis. This year, it has also formulated an advanced action plan to ensure the completion of the national plan, striving to complete the annual national plan 40 days ahead of schedule. However, the Five-Three Factory still has many shortcomings in its planning management work, mainly that the control and supervision of production scheduling is insufficient, and there are still imbalances in the production process; technical organizational measures are not implemented in a timely manner. Of the ten measures that should have been implemented in the first quarter of this year, only seven were implemented. The installation of automatic devices is slow, which affects the progress of the plan. In terms of cost management, both pre-control and post-analysis are not strict and timely enough; the management of working capital, especially production funds, is poor, and the task was not completed according to the production fund quota, exceeding it by 52% in February; grassroots statistics are not accurate enough, the profit and loss situation of some processes is still relatively serious, and spare parts cannot be processed in a timely manner, which affects the grasp of quality; in terms of improving labor productivity, the productivity of direct production workers has increased more, but the productivity of auxiliary workers has increased very little, and the labor indicators cannot be fully completed.
    In response to these problems, the Five-Three Factory first organized cadres to seriously study the instructions and documents from higher authorities, practically assessed the current situation of the factory's planning management, and then formulated a general action plan after full deliberation. The requirements put forward in the general action plan are: to further organize rhythmic production and improve labor productivity; to further strengthen cost accounting and reduce costs; to improve working capital management and accelerate the turnover of working capital; and at the same time, to vigorously improve grassroots statistical work. In order to achieve the expected results of strengthening planning management, it was decided to start with improving operation plans and further organizing rhythmic production. Other work related to capital management, grassroots statistics, quota setting, and adjustment of labor organization should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner around the link of organizing rhythmic production.
    After determining the goals and practices for strengthening planning management, the Five-Three Factory conducted a series of investigations and research. First, it investigated and studied the current situation of organizing rhythmic production, and grasped the problems in the preparation of operation plans, the implementation of operation plans, statistical work, and quota setting work. For example, it was found that the preparation work was poor when formulating operation plans in the past, and the required data was incomplete (some of it was not accurate), so only general progress was arranged, which did not play a role in guiding production and controlling production; there was insufficient inspection during the implementation of the plan, and problems could not be fully and timely discovered, so the main problems could not be grasped, and weak links could not be quickly resolved. Planning work was also somewhat disconnected from scheduling work, and scheduling was not flexible enough. Secondly, through various symposiums and individual talks and side understanding, the understanding of planning management by management cadres at all levels, statistical personnel, foremen and workers was investigated, and many problems were also found in this regard. For example, most of the cadres do not have a comprehensive understanding of planning management, and they do not realize that strengthening planning management is a basic step to improve enterprise management, which reflects their lack of learning of economic knowledge; some cadres have a better understanding, but it is only limited to theoretical understanding. In practice, especially when completing urgent tasks, there is a phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of the other, and the work cannot be fully improved; some cadres are satisfied with the surface figures, blindly optimistic, and do not do in-depth investigations and research; in addition, there are a few technicians and staff members who believe that completing tasks is the responsibility of the factory director and workshop director, and hold an attitude that it has nothing to do with them.
    After grasping the above situation, in order to ensure the smooth progress of strengthening planning management, the Five-Three Factory trained key members in workshops, including the training of party members and members of the Communist Youth League, the training of foremen, the training of technicians and staff, and the training of grassroots statistical personnel. The training content mainly included studying documents, organizing reports and discussions, so that various personnel clearly recognized their business and responsibilities, and organizing typical introductions, linking inspections to improve understanding. The Five-Three Factory has started to strengthen planning management in workshops one, two, and five since late April in order to gain experience and prepare to further carry out this work comprehensively. The work steps formulated by the factory are: first, establish a model for actively doing a good job in planning management, summarize advanced ideas and advanced deeds, and promote them comprehensively; second, widely and deeply publicize the great significance of strengthening planning management, combining the situation, requirements and practices of the unit to carry out mobilization and education, and combine advanced figures and advanced deeds to inspire employees to expose problems, find tricks around key points and propose rationalization proposals, solve key problems in production, and break through weak links; third, improve the system and further organize rhythmic production.

    五三工厂加强计划管理
    【本报讯】全国模范工厂——五三工厂正在原有基础上加强计划管理工作。
    五三工厂从一九五一年以来，就逐步地建立与健全着计划管理工作，企业管理水平与生产水平都有显著的提高，几年来，一直逐月逐年地超额完成生产任务。今年又制订了保证完成国家计划的先进行动计划，争取提前四十天完成全年国家计划。但是，五三工厂在计划管理工作上仍然有许多缺点，主要是对生产调度工作的控制、监督作用不够，生产过程中仍有不均衡现象；技术组织措施计划实现得不够及时，今年第一季度应该实现的十件措施项目，只实现了七件，自动装置安装慢，影响了计划进度；在成本管理方面，事先控制与事后分析都不够严格和及时；对流动资金的管理，特别是生产资金的管理较差，没有按生产资金定额完成任务，二月份又超过了百分之五十二；基层统计不够准确，一部分工序的盈亏情况仍然比较严重，备品不能及时处理，影响了对质量的掌握；在提高劳动生产率方面，直接生产工人提高的较多，但辅助工人提高的很少，不能全面完成劳动指标。
    针对上面这些问题，五三工厂在加强计划管理工作时，首先组织干部认真学习上级的指示文件，切实地估计了本厂计划管理的现状，然后经过充分的酝酿制订了总的行动计划。总的行动计划提出的要求是：进一步组织有节奏生产，提高劳动生产率；进一步加强成本核算，降低成本；改进流动资金管理，加速流动资金的周转；同时大力改进基层统计工作。为了使加强计划管理工作达到预期效果，决定首先从改进作业计划和进一步组织有节奏生产着手，其他有关资金管理、基层统计、定额定员、调整劳动组织等方面的工作，都要围绕组织有节奏生产这一环节有计划有步骤地进行。
    五三工厂在确定加强计划管理工作的目标和做法以后，进行了一系列的调查研究工作。首先调查研究了当前组织有节奏生产的情况，掌握了在编制作业计划、执行作业计划、统计工作、定额定员工作等方面的问题。例如发现过去在制订作业计划时准备工作差，需要的资料不完整（一部分不确实），因此只是一般地排进度，起不到指导生产与控制生产的作用；在执行计划过程中检查不够，不能全面地及时地发现问题，因此也就抓不住主要问题，很快地解决薄弱环节，计划工作与调度工作也有些脱节，调度不灵活。其次通过各类座谈会和个别谈话及侧面了解，调查了各级管理干部、统计人员、工长与工人等对计划管理的认识，在这方面也发现了不少问题。例如干部当中大部分人对计划管理的认识不够全面，对加强计划管理是改善企业经营管理的基本步骤认识不足，反映了他们缺乏对经济知识的学习；一部分干部认识较好，但又仅限于理论上的认识，在实践中，特别在完成紧急任务的时候，就产生了顾此失彼的现象，不能全面提高工作；也有部分干部满足于表面数字，盲目乐观，不做深入的调查研究；此外，还有少数技术人员和职员认为完成任务是厂长和车间主任的事，抱着与我无关的态度。
    掌握了上述情况后，为了保证加强计划管理工作的顺利进行，五三工厂以车间为单位分别训练了骨干分子，包括党员、团员的训练，工长的训练，技术人员和职员的训练，基层统计人员的训练。训练内容主要是学习文件，组织报告和讨论，使各种人员明确地认识自己的业务和责任，并组织典型介绍，联系检查思想提高认识。五三工厂从四月下旬开始已先在一、二、五等车间进行加强计划管理工作，以便取得经验，准备进一步全面开展这项工作。该厂订出的工作步骤是：一、树立积极搞好计划管理的榜样，总结先进思想与先进事迹，全面推广；二、广泛深入地宣传加强计划管理的重大意义，联系本单位的情况、要求与做法，进行动员教育，并结合先进人物和先进事迹启发职工揭发问题，围绕关键找窍门和提合理化建议，解决生产上关键性的问题，突破薄弱环节；三、健全制度，进一步组织有节奏生产。
