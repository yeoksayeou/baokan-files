Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 23rd: While continuing to obstruct the armistice negotiations, the American aggressors are intensifying their indiscriminate bombing of peaceful rural areas in the rear of Korea, slaughtering peaceful residents. In the five days from May 18th to 22nd, formations of U.S. Air Force fighter planes and bombers (including B-29s) again continuously bombed Jaeryong County and Soheung County in Hwanghae Province, Yongchon County and Unjon County in North Pyongan Province, Sinpo County in South Hamgyong Province, and Daedong County in South Pyongan Province, all rear areas far from the front lines, with heavy bombs, fragmentation bombs, incendiary bombs, and napalm bombs, and all the bombing occurred in peaceful rural residential areas. At the same time, because the U.S. invading air force fears the increasingly strong Korean and Chinese People's Air Force and the increasingly fierce ground anti-aircraft fire, it does not dare to dispatch large-scale sorties during the day. All these indiscriminate bombing atrocities were carried out stealthily at night. At 2:30 a.m. on the 21st, six U.S. Air Force B-29 bombers dropped more than 600 napalm bombs, frantically burning several temporary villages along the highway from Daedong County to Pyongyang. The residents there were all victims of the American bombing of the Gyeonryong Reservoir a week earlier, including many women and children. These victims, under the care of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government and with the strong help of people from all walks of life, had just built hundreds of homes, which were again destroyed by American aerial bandits, and more than 120 victims were burned to death or injured.
    Observers here point out that the American aggressors are continuously committing such inhumane and brutal crimes entirely for the purpose of destroying peaceful villages unrelated to "military targets" and slaughtering innocent farmers. The American aggressors are clearly attempting to force the Korean and Chinese delegations to accept the unreasonable "counter-proposals" it has put forward at the armistice negotiation table. However, the arrogant attempt of the American aggressors will never be realized. The heroic Korean people are currently responding to the beastly atrocities of the American aggressors with practical actions such as stepping up the restoration work in the disaster areas and further strengthening support for the front lines.

    美侵朝空军又滥炸和平乡村
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】美国侵略者在继续阻挠停战谈判的同时，正在加紧滥炸朝鲜后方和平农村，屠杀和平居民。在从五月十八日到二十二日的五天中，美国空军战斗机和轰炸机（包括B二九型）编队又连续以重磅炸弹、杀伤弹、烧夷弹和凝固汽油弹轰炸黄海道的载宁郡、瑞兴郡，平安北道的龙川郡、云田郡，咸镜南道的新浦郡和平安南道的大同郡等远离战线的后方区域，而且都在和平的农村居民地带轰炸。同时，由于美国侵朝空军害怕日益壮大的朝中人民空军和越来越猛烈的地上高射炮火，不敢在白天大规模出动。所有这些滥炸暴行都是偷偷摸摸地在深夜进行的，二十一日晨二时半，美国空军B二十九型轰炸机六架投下凝固汽油弹六百多颗，疯狂地焚烧从大同郡到平壤的公路旁的几个临时村庄。在那里居住的都是一个星期以前美机轰炸见龙贮水池时被害的灾民，其中有许多妇女和儿童。这些灾民在朝鲜劳动党与共和国政府的关怀和各界人民的大力帮助下，刚刚盖起几百所住所来，就又被美国空中强盗炸毁了，有一百二十多名灾民被烧死烧伤。
    此间观察家指出：美国侵略者连续制造这种丧尽人性的残暴罪行，完全是以毁灭与“军事目标”毫不相干的和平乡村、屠杀无辜农民为目的。美国侵略者显然企图借此迫使朝中代表团接受它在停战谈判桌上所提出的蛮横无理的“反建议”，但是，美国侵略者的狂妄企图是永远不能实现的。英雄的朝鲜人民目前正在以加紧进行灾区的恢复工作和进一步加强支援前线的实际行动，答复美国侵略者的野兽暴行。
