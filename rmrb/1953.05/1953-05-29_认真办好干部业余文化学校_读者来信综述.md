Conscientiously Run Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Schools
    --Summary of Readers' Letters
    We have successively received letters from readers in Beijing, Shanxi, Jiangxi, and many other regions, reflecting the following unresolved problems in local cadre spare-time cultural schools:
    First, there is still a phenomenon of no one being responsible in terms of leadership. For example, Cheng Zongding, Xu Juman, and Wang Zhizhi from the Jiangxi Provincial-Level Government Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School wrote that the Provincial Department of Education, the Personnel Department, the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, and the school all have leadership relationships. However, these three departments often only ask the school for statistical figures; when the school raises difficulties in its work, they pass the buck to each other, and no one solves them. Hu Shun, a teacher at the Lianyungang District Government Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Remedial School in Xinhailian City, Jiangsu, also wrote that the local cadre spare-time cultural schools also have the above-mentioned "three-no-care" situation of no leadership. A joint letter from fifty-one teachers at the Shanxi Provincial On-the-Job Cadre Cultural Remedial School also specifically pointed out that the Provincial Department of Education provides very little guidance to the school and has rarely issued instructions regarding spare-time cultural education in government organs or convened relevant meetings in recent years.
    Second, there are too few full-time teachers and staff. For example, the Jiangxi Provincial-Level Government Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School's junior high school classes have more than 400 students, but only two full-time teachers. When the school requested additional full-time teachers, the Provincial Department of Education said, "Since it is a spare-time school, there should not be too many full-time teachers." Ding Guozhen, a teacher at the Dongdan District Workers' Spare-Time School in Beijing, reflected that the school has one full-time teacher for every 200 students on average, and the full-time teachers also have to manage administrative affairs, making them too busy. The Shanxi Provincial On-the-Job Cadre Cultural Remedial School has more than 4,000 students, and the administrative staff, in addition to one director and one deputy director of education, also has teachers concurrently handling teaching affairs, general affairs, accounting, and printing, which affects the teaching work of the teachers. In terms of teacher compensation, the compensation for teachers in spare-time schools in Dongdan District of Beijing, Jiangxi Province, Shanxi Province, and Taiyuan City of Shanxi Province are all lower than those in general schools. Yang Su of the Taiyuan City On-the-Job Cadre Cultural Remedial School reflected that some middle-level (upper elementary school) teachers and workers at the school receive the same salary, and even the highest salary for senior-level (junior high school) teachers is lower than that of clerks.
    Third, there is no guarantee of school funding. The funding for the Jiangxi Provincial-Level Government Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School mainly relies on charging tuition fees to the work units of the students. The Shanxi Provincial On-the-Job Cadre Cultural Remedial School did not have any funding for teachers' salaries in the first half of 1952 and relied on temporary loans every month; in the second half of 1952, it was determined that the funding would be paid from the surplus funds of the cultural and educational undertakings of the Department of Education, but the most basic books, desks, stoves, and other setting costs have not yet been properly resolved. The funding for the Xinhailian City Government Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Remedial School is, according to a notice from the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, paid from the learning expenses for cadres and odd-job workers in the administrative expenses of the government organs. Many government schools with a large proportion of cadres participating in cultural studies have no way to maintain their operations, some have to reduce the number of classes, and some have to suspend junior high school classes... This problem has not yet been resolved after requesting instructions from the Provincial People's Government. Some schools also have extreme difficulties with housing. The classrooms, offices, dormitories, and office supplies of the Jiangxi Provincial-Level Government Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School are all borrowed. Three teachers live in the corridor; in addition to sharing one desk for two people, there are no other office supplies. Many teachers at the Taiyuan City On-the-Job Cadre Cultural Remedial School sleep in the office, and some even sleep outdoors.
    All the letter writers pointed out that running spare-time cultural schools so that on-the-job cadres can work and study at the same time is an important and effective way to improve the cultural level of cadres. However, the above-mentioned problems have hindered the spare-time cultural schools from playing a greater role. They unanimously suggested that the local People's Government's cultural and educational departments and the Party Committee's propaganda and education departments strengthen their attention to and leadership of this work, and promptly help the schools appropriately solve the above problems according to needs and possibilities.

### 认真办好干部业余文化学校——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    认真办好干部业余文化学校
    ——读者来信综述
    我们先后收到北京、山西、江西等不少地区的读者来信，反映当地的干部业余文化学校还有以下问题没有得到解决：
    首先，在领导问题上还有着某些无人负责的现象。如江西省级机关干部业余文化学校程宗定、许居曼、王致知来信说：该省教育厅、人事厅以及省委宣传部和该校都有领导关系。但这三个机关往往只是向该校要些统计数字；而在该校提出工作中的困难时，却互相推诿，谁也不解决。江苏新海连市连云港区机关干部业余文化补习学校教员胡舜的来信中也反映了当地干部业余文化学校也有上述“三不管”的无人领导情况。山西省级在职干部文化补习学校五十一名教员联名信中还特别指出：省教育厅对该校指导很少，几年来甚至很少发给有关机关业余文化教育方面的指示和召集有关的会议。
    其次，专职教职员配备太少。如江西省级机关干部业余文化学校初中班学生共四百余人，只有专任教师二人；该校要求增添专职教员，省教育厅却说：“既是业余学校，就不应多配备专职教员。”北京东单区职工业余学校教员丁国桢反映：该校平均每两百个学员设一个专任教员，专任教员还要管行政事务工作，实在忙不过来。山西省级在职干部文化补习学校有学员四千多人，行政工作人员除正副教导主任各一人外，其余教务、总务、会计、文印都由教员兼办，影响了教员的教学工作。在教员待遇方面，北京东单区、江西省、山西省、山西太原市各业余学校教员待遇都比当地一般学校低。太原市在职干部文化补习学校杨甦反映：该校还有中级组（高小）教师和工友所领薪金一样，甚至高级组（初中）教员最高薪金还低于事务员的薪金。
    再次，学校经费没有保证。江西省级机关干部业余文化学校经费主要靠向学员工作机关收费维持。山西省级在职干部文化补习学校在一九五二年上半年的教职员工资都无着落，每月靠暂借维持；一九五二年下半年才确定经费由教育厅文教事业费节余款项中开支，但起码的图书、桌凳、烤火以及其他设置费用仍未得到适当解决。新海连市机关干部业余文化补习学校的经费，按江苏省人民政府通知，由机关行政费中干部、勤杂人员学习费开支。很多参加文化学习干部比例较大的机关学校就没法维持，有的要缩班，有的要停办初中班……这个问题经向省人民政府请示，仍未得到解决。有些学校房屋也极端困难。江西省级机关干部业余文化学校教室、办公室、宿舍以及办公用具都是借用的。有三个教员住在走廊上；除办公桌两人合用一张外，其它办公用具一点没有。太原市在职干部文化补习学校不少教员睡在办公室，有的甚至睡在屋外。
    所有来信的读者都指出：举办业余文化学校，使在职干部能够一面工作、一面学习；这是提高干部文化水平的重要而有效的方法之一。而上述问题已经阻碍了业余文化学校发挥更大的作用。他们一致建议当地人民政府文教部门和党委宣教部门加强对这个工作的重视和领导，迅速帮助学校方面根据需要和可能，适当解决以上问题。
