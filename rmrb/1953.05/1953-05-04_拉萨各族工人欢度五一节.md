Many Tibetan and Hui workers put on their holiday attire. They called May 1st "New Year," happily singing songs such as "Unity is Strength" and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" At the celebration meeting, General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, called on workers of all nationalities to strengthen unity and be constantly vigilant against the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialism. He said: Imperialism is not reconciled to the leaping progress of our motherland, especially the liberation of the Tibetan people from the shackles of imperialism. Workers should unite closely, regardless of nationality, belief, or industry, work hard to improve their skills, and build a prosperous new Tibet under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Dongbo·Zaxi Linba, the candidate for Kalon representing the local government of Tibet, said in his speech: The close unity of workers of all nationalities demonstrates the new relationship between all nationalities in the motherland, which is the result of Chairman Mao's wise policy. Ava Danzhu, a famous Tibetan poet, excitedly expressed his feelings, listing many facts about the unity and construction of Tibet by Tibetan and Han workers over the past year. Finally, he cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the great unity of the Tibetan and Han nationalities!"
