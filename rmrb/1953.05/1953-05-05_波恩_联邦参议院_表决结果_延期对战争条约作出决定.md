    Bonn "Federal Senate" Voting Results:
    Decision on War Treaty Postponed
    Adenauer and his American Masters Suffer Another Setback
    [Xinhua News Agency] Berlin dispatch: The Bonn "Federal Senate" voted on April 24 to postpone a decision on the Bonn and Paris treaties, causing the Adenauer group to suffer another serious setback in the matter of ratifying the war treaties.
    Before the "Federal Senate" held its vote, Adenauer, who had just returned to West Germany from the United States with instructions to immediately ratify the treaties, threatened the parliamentarians with a reduction in "aid" from the United States, demanding that they quickly pass the war treaties. He said that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had threatened that if the European Army Treaty could not be finally ratified before June 30, the United States would withhold dollars. However, Adenauer's shameless intimidation still failed to produce the expected result in the Senate vote. Under the angry wave of popular opposition, most senators did not dare to take responsibility for ratifying the war treaties. The "Federal Senate" voted by twenty votes to eighteen to postpone the decision until the Supreme Court had decided whether the treaty was in accordance with the Bonn constitution.
    On the evening after the Senate vote, Adenauer immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting and held a press conference afterwards, threatening to disregard the "Federal Senate" vote and directly ask the President to sign the Bonn and Paris treaties. However, Hughes, after meeting with Adenauer on the 27th, issued a statement refusing to sign before the Supreme Court made a decision. At the same time, Adenauer announced that he had cancelled his original plan to ask Hughes to sign.
    Naumov, the Berlin correspondent of "Pravda," commented on the Bonn "Federal Senate's" decision to postpone a decision on the Bonn and Paris war treaties, pointing out that the voting result of the Bonn Senate shows that the reactionary parties in the Senate cannot completely ignore the will of the people, and they have to consider the fierce protests of the majority of Germans to a certain extent. The majority of Germans oppose the policy of splitting Germany and turning West Germany into a militarist state. Under such circumstances, the Social Democratic majority in the Senate believes that it is impossible to openly endorse the Bonn and Paris treaties; however, they do not dare to vote against these treaties either, which is why they chose the third path—postponing the decision. Naumov said: But even this timid and ambiguous decision of the Bonn Senate has already dealt a serious blow to Adenauer and those who support him’s plans to demand the rapid ratification of these war treaties.

    波恩“联邦参议院”表决结果
    延期对战争条约作出决定
    阿登纳及其美国主子再次遭到挫折
    【新华社讯】柏林消息：波恩“联邦参议院”于四月二十四日表决延期就波恩与巴黎条约作出决定，使得阿登纳集团在批准战争条约的问题上再度遭到了严重的挫折。
    在“联邦参议院”举行表决之前，刚刚从美国带着必须立即批准条约的指示回到西德的阿登纳，曾以美国将减少对西德的“援助”恫吓议员们，要他们迅速通过战争条约。他说，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经威胁说：假如在六月三十日以前还不能最后批准欧洲军条约，美国就要不给美元了。然而，阿登纳的这种无耻的恫吓仍然没有能使参议院的表决产生预期的结果。在人民愤怒的反对浪潮之下，多数参议院议员不敢承担批准战争条约的责任。“联邦参议院”以二十票对十八票表决待最高法院就条约是否合乎波恩宪法的问题作出决定以后再作决定。
    在参议院表决之后的当晚，阿登纳立即召集了一次紧急的内阁会议，并在会后举行记者招待会，威胁说要不顾“联邦参议院”的表决，直接要求总统在波恩与巴黎条约上签字。但是休斯在二十七日和阿登纳会谈后发表声明，拒绝在最高法院作出决定前签字。同时，阿登纳又宣布说，他已取消了原先要求休斯签字的计划。
    “真理报”驻柏林记者瑙莫夫在评论波恩“联邦参议院”表决延期就波恩和巴黎战争条约作出决定一事时指出，波恩参议院的表决结果说明，参议院中的反动党派不能完全不顾人民的意志，他们不得不在一定程度内考虑多数德国人的猛烈抗议。大多数德国人都反对分裂德国和把德国西部变成一个军国主义国家的政策。在这种情况下，参议院中的社会民主党多数认为，公开地赞同波恩和巴黎条约是不可能的；但是，他们也不敢投票反对这些条约，这就是他们选择第三条道路——延期作决定——的原因。瑙莫夫说：但是，即使是波恩参议院的这个胆小的、不三不四的决定，也已经给了阿登纳和那些替他撑腰的人要求迅速批准这些战争条约的计划一个严重的打击。
