    [Report from this newspaper] The creative movement of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, a state-owned enterprise, to transform old equipment into mechanized and automated systems has penetrated every corner of all factories and mines within the company. This movement has played a significant role in increasing labor productivity. Since the successful creation of the "anti-looping device" in the small rolling mill last year, up to the end of April this year, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-two factories and mines, a total of 1,144 proposals for mechanization and automation have been submitted, of which 853 have been approved and implemented by the company, and 167 have already been successfully tested. Among them, the small rolling mill, after mechanizing and automating eleven processes, has successfully developed automatic material feeding for the heating furnace and the 12 cm "anti-looping device." Now, the entire factory has basically achieved full mechanization and automation. After the successful creation of the automatic steel pusher, automatic pipes, anti-looping device, automatic cold bed, and automatic switch for the heating furnace in the nail factory, the entire factory is also approaching full mechanization and automation. Other factories and mines have also greatly improved labor efficiency after achieving mechanization and automation improvements. After the successful creation of the automatic pipe bending machine in the cast iron pipe factory, labor efficiency increased by 50 percent. The automatic steel sliding machine and automatic guide plate created in the medium-sized rolling mill completely replaced manual labor. After the successful creation of the automatic weighing machine in the steel rope factory, labor efficiency increased tenfold, completely eliminating workers' "occupational diseases." Other successful research includes the automatic iron return track in the ore dressing plant, the automatic friction brick press in the refractory plant, and the automatic regulator and automatic generator synchronization in the power plant.
    Furthermore: Anshan Iron and Steel Company has overfulfilled its production targets for April, and the capital construction tasks for April have also been overfulfilled simultaneously. In terms of production, pig iron has exceeded the original plan by 8.13 percent, and steel has exceeded the original plan by 2.15 percent. In terms of capital construction, the nine major projects that began construction this year have also overfulfilled their April tasks. Among them, steel bars have exceeded the original plan by 106.2 percent, concrete has exceeded the original plan by 50.57 percent, earthwork has exceeded the original plan by 28.56 percent, and formwork has exceeded the original plan by 58.22 percent.

    鞍钢广泛展开机械化运动
    四月份生产和基本建设任务都超额完成
    【本报讯】国营鞍山钢铁公司改造旧设备为机械化自动化的创造性的运动，已经深入到全公司各厂矿的每个角落。这一运动对提高劳动生产率起了很大作用。从去年小型轧钢厂创造“反围盘”成功后，到今年四月底止，据二十二个厂矿不完全的统计，关于机械化自动化的建议，已达一千一百四十四件，经公司批准执行的有八百五十三件，现在已有一百六十七件试验成功。其中小型轧钢厂继十一道工序进行机械化自动化生产后，加热炉自动运料与十二糎的“反围盘”又告成功，现在全厂已经基本上达到全部机械化自动化生产。制钉厂加热炉自动推钢机、自动管道、反围盘、冷床自动与自动开关等成功以后，现在全厂也接近全部机械化自动化生产。其它厂矿在获得机械化自动化的改进以后，劳动效率也大大提高。铸管厂自动挠管机创造成功后，劳动效率提高百分之五十。中型轧钢厂自动滑钢机与自动导板创造成功后，就完全代替了工人们的体力劳动。钢绳厂自动打磅机创造成功后，劳动效率提高十倍，完全根绝了工人们的“职业病”。其它如选矿厂的自动回铁道、耐火厂的自动磨擦压砖机、发电厂的自动调正器和发电机的自动合车等等，也都已经研究成功。又讯：鞍山钢铁公司已经超额完成了四月份的生产任务，四月份基本建设任务也同时超额完成。在生产方面，生铁已超过原计划的百分之八点一三，钢超过原计划的二点一五。在基本建设方面，今年开始建设的九项主要工程，也都已超额完成四月份任务。其中钢筋已超过原计划百分之一百零六点二，混凝土超过原计划百分之五十点五七，土方超过原计划百分之二十八点五六，模板超过原计划百分之五十八点二二。
