    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 29th: The anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and responsibility system establishment movement carried out by the capital construction departments of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company has entered a new stage. Currently, the company's leadership has issued instructions to all units, requiring them to establish responsibility systems by discussing this year's capital construction plans or completion plans.
    The various capital construction departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been carrying out this movement for more than a month. Through this movement, most units have thoroughly exposed waste and irresponsibility in their work, and have made preliminary solutions to problems that can be solved immediately. For example, the construction site of the large rolling mill exposed a total of 22,000 instances of waste and irresponsibility, and more than 10,000 have been resolved so far. Facts have proven that the waste and irresponsibility revealed by the workers are important problems hindering the completion of this year's engineering construction plan and the improvement of enterprise management. Currently, each unit is gradually establishing various responsibility systems based on the problems revealed. In the future, it is required that everyone be responsible for everything, that the cause can be found when problems occur, and at the same time, each unit conducts education through typical examples to further enhance the understanding of the vast number of workers of the significance of their work to the realization of national industrialization, the consistency of national interests and personal interests, so as to establish the concept of completing the national task "well, quickly, and economically" and safely and comprehensively. The leadership of Anshan Iron and Steel Company emphasized that the establishment of the responsibility system is to ensure the completion of this year's engineering tasks. Therefore, each unit must gradually establish various responsibility systems by discussing this year's capital construction plan or completion plan, and promptly check the completion of this year's capital construction plan of the unit and the existing problems, put it together with the problems revealed by the workers for sorting, identify the key problems, and formulate strict systems to ensure that they are resolved.

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 29th: The anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and responsibility system establishment movement carried out by the capital construction departments of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company has brought a new atmosphere to various construction sites.
    Now, on the blackboards and through the loudspeakers at the construction sites, examples of workers strengthening their sense of responsibility are being spread every day. Several times in the evening or in the middle of the night when it suddenly rained, workers such as Jin Chengxing and staff member Zhang Yonglin at the large rolling mill construction site rushed to the construction site from the dormitory in the rain, covering all the newly poured foundations and materials accumulated on the construction site, ensuring the quality of the project and avoiding the loss of materials due to rain. In the past, when the materials section of the Metal Structure Engineering Company made plans, some staff members purchased more than 100 tons of steel materials in the plan without the approval of superiors and without asking for project needs. Now, when they make plans, they carefully review the material supply plans reported by each unit. Once, a certain engineering team wanted to receive 200 hammer handles. Zhao Yi, a staff member of the material section, saw that their plan was too large, so he took the initiative to go to the site for investigation. As a result, it was enough to issue only 50 hammer handles to them. When the construction of a large rolling mill building frame was very urgent, a welding team stopped work due to the lack of four gas tanks. The workers of the team actively tried to use waste products to make gas tanks, ensuring the progress of the project.
    Through the education of this movement, the workers' concept of cherishing state property has also been greatly strengthened in various construction sites. Since the launch of the movement, the workers of the steel and wood formwork team at the construction site of the large rolling mill have picked up nails, steel bars, and other materials from the construction site worth more than 600 million yuan. The workers of the drainage team recovered two and a half tons of iron pipes from the construction site, and also collected and repaired twenty broken water pumps that were scattered on the construction site and exposed to wind and rain. When the material section of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company checked the warehouse, they handed over surplus materials such as steel bricks, granite, and light glass worth 3.5 billion yuan, and about 7 billion yuan worth of "black materials" that were checked out. The Metal Structure Engineering Company also recovered more than 900 tons of good or waste steel and mechanical parts from the construction site, including 60 chain hoists that can be used after repair. In order to recover these properties, material clerk Zhao Yi and several workers lived at the construction site for 22 nights. During the day, the cranes at the construction site were busy lifting and transporting other equipment, so they used the evening time to drive the cranes to collect the steel scattered everywhere.
    During the movement, since various construction sites implemented the policy of "expose and improve at the same time," many works have been improved, and work efficiency has been improved. The concrete team at the construction site of the large rolling mill has a total of 600 people. In the first quarter of this year, 200 people had to waste work every day. During the movement, due to the establishment of the responsibility system, the plans for workers required by each section to the team must be submitted 24 hours in advance, so that the team can review the plan, check the equipment, and allocate manpower. This basically solved the serious waste of work phenomenon. The steel and wood formwork team has established a steel bar warehousing, storage, numbering, and other systems, so that the confusion in management and the phenomenon of steel bars "traveling" on the construction site are eliminated. The carpentry team has also established packaging, unloading, taking, sending, and warehousing systems, which not only eliminates the past alarming waste phenomenon, but also accelerates the turnover of materials. The carpentry team leader improved the transportation work of "prefabricated panels," increasing the number of pieces transported by each car from 15 to 40, saving a lot of wealth for the country. The workers of the Ironmaking Engineering Company who built the hot blast pipe and straight pipe test pressure pipe for the No. 7 blast furnace also improved the operating methods, increasing the work efficiency by 12 times. In the past, 20% of the iron plates manufactured by the repair shop of the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company for building coke ovens were unqualified or regarded as waste products, but now all waste products have been eliminated. After the Da Gushan Drilling Team's 1,000-meter drilling rig (which can drill 1,000 meters deep) improved the operating methods through the establishment of the responsibility system movement, the core recovery rate increased from 49% in March to 93.4%.

    鞍钢正逐步建立责任制
    【新华社鞍山二十九日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门开展的反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动，已进入新的阶段。目前，公司的领导方面已向各单位发出指示，要求各单位通过讨论今年的基本建设计划或竣工计划，建立起责任制度。
    鞍山钢铁公司各基本建设部门开展这一运动已有一个多月。大多数单位通过这一运动，都彻底地揭发了工作中的浪费和无人负责现象，并把当前能够解决的问题作了初步解决。如大型轧钢厂工地揭发出浪费和无人负责的问题共两万两千件，到目前为止已解决了一万多件。事实证明：职工们揭发出来的浪费和无人负责现象，都是阻碍完成今年工程建设计划和改进企业管理的重要问题。目前，各单位正在根据揭发出来的问题，逐步建立各种责任制度。今后要求做到事事有人负责，发生了问题能够找到原因，同时各单位并通过典型事例进行教育，使广大职工进一步认识自己的工作对实现国家工业化的意义，国家利益和个人利益的一致，从而树立起做到“好、快、省”和安全、全面地完成国家任务的观念。鞍山钢铁公司领导方面强调指出，建立责任制是为了保证完成今年的工程任务。因此，各单位要通过讨论今年的基本建设计划或竣工计划，逐步建立各种责任制，并及时检查本单位今年基本建设计划完成的情况和存在的问题，把它和职工们揭发出来的问题，摆在一起进行排队，找出关键问题，制订出严格的制度以保证得到解决。
    【新华社鞍山二十九日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门开展的反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动，给各个工地带来了新的气象。
    现在，各工地里的黑板报上，扩音器里，每天都在传播着职工们加强责任观念的事例。有几次傍晚或半夜里突然下雨了，大型轧钢厂工地的工人金承星等和职员张永林，冒雨从宿舍赶到工地，把刚浇灌好的基础和积存在工地的材料全部盖好，保证了工程质量，避免了材料被雨淋的损失。金属结构工程公司材料科过去作计划时，有的职员不经上级批准，不问工程需要，就随便在计划内多增购一百多吨钢材。现在他们作计划时，对各个单位报来的材料供应计划，都经过仔细审查。有一次某工程队要领二百个锤把，材料科的职员赵义看到他们的计划太大，就主动到现场调查，结果只发给他们五十把锤把就够用了。正在建筑大型轧钢厂厂房架的一个电焊班，在工程非常紧急的时候，因缺少四个瓦斯罐而停工待料，该班工人积极设法利用废品作成了瓦斯罐，保证了工程进度。
    通过这次运动的教育，各个工地工人们爱护国家财产的观念也大大加强了。大型轧钢厂工地钢筋木模队的工人们，自运动开展以来，从工地上拣回来的钉子、钢筋等材料，就值六亿多元。排水队的工人们，从工地上收回了两吨半铁管子，并把散弃在工地上被风吹雨淋的二十台坏水泵也搜集到一起修理好了。轧钢工程公司材料科在清点仓库时，把价值三十五亿元的钢砖、花岗石、轻鍭玻璃等多余材料，和清点出来的约值七十多亿元的“黑材料”，都上缴了。金属结构工程公司从工地里也收回了九百多吨好的或废的钢材和机件，其中有六十台链式起重机经过修理就能使用。为了收回这些财产，材料员赵义和几个工人曾在工地上住了二十二夜。白天工地上的起重机都在紧张地吊运其他器材，他们就利用晚上的时间，开着起重机来收集散落在各处的钢材。
    在运动中，由于各个工地执行了“边揭发、边改进”的方针，许多工作得到了改进，工作效率提高了。大型轧钢厂工地混凝土队共六百人，今年第一季度中每天要窝工二百个。在运动中由于建立了责任制度，各工段向该队要工人的计划必须在二十四小时以前提出，以便该队审查计划，检查设备，配备人力。这样就基本上解决了严重的窝工现象。钢筋木模队建立了钢筋出入库、保管、编号等制度，使管理上的混乱和钢筋在工地“旅行”的现象消除。木工队也建立了包装、包卸、包取、包送和出入库制度，不仅消除了过去惊人的浪费现象，而且还加速了材料的周转。木工队长改进了“预制板”的运输工作，使每辆汽车由每次运十五块提高到四十块，给国家节省大量的财富。炼铁工程公司修建七号高炉热围风管和直管试压管的职工们，也改进了操作方法，使工作效率提高了十二倍。机械安装工程公司修配厂制造的建筑焦炉用的铁板，过去不合格的或作为废品的占百分之二十，现在全部消灭了废品。大孤山钻探队千公尺钻机（能钻一千公尺深）经过建立责任制运动，改进了操作方法，岩芯采取率从三月份的百分之四十九，提高到百分之九十三点四。
