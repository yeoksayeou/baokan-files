    Xinjiang, Hunan, and Anhui Basically Complete Locust Control Preparations
    The locust control preparations in Xinjiang, Hunan, and Anhui provinces have been basically completed. Currently, locust areas in the three provinces are closely inspecting locust egg hatching in order to eliminate locusts before their third instar stage.
    In Xinjiang Province, in addition to the establishment of a provincial locust control headquarters, nine key locust control counties, including Dihua, Suilai, Jinghua, Changji, Qiantde, Fukang, Wusu, Shawan, and Heshur, have established locust control command posts. Recently, Zhang Bangying, Third Secretary of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Saifuddin, Fourth Secretary, and Gao Jinchun, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, visited Dihua and other counties to inspect locust control preparations, examine the hatching and growth of locust nymphs, and listen to the opinions of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups on locust control work. More than 3,100 cadres transferred from the province have also departed for key locust control areas to assist farmers and herdsmen in controlling locust plagues. Farmers and herdsmen in locust areas have prepared large quantities of poisoned bait and wheat bran for mixing with pesticides. The Provincial Locust Control Headquarters has specially allocated more than 20 trucks to transport "666" pesticide powder and dusters to various locust areas. Aircraft prepared for locust control are ready for deployment.
    In mid-April, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hunan Provincial People's Government dispatched 18 locust control cadres to Taojiang, Youxian, Yiyang and other counties in last year's locust areas to guide farmers in investigating locust egg hatching and actively preparing for locust control. Currently, locust control headquarters and stations at all levels in locust areas have been established, and more than 3,000 sprayers and more than 300,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder have been transported to locust areas on time. Taojiang County has also trained more than 400 locust scouts and locust control personnel.
    After careful inspection, Anhui Province has identified a total of more than 800,000 mu of land with locust eggs. In order to eliminate locusts as early as possible, the Anhui Provincial People's Government has long instructed various localities to make preparations for locust extermination. Currently, counties in the Chuxian Special District have successively held locust extermination representative meetings, established locust extermination organizations at all levels, and trained locust extermination personnel. The amount of "666" pesticide powder prepared in the entire special district has doubled compared with last year, and the number of sprayers has increased by 50%. In Sixian County, Su County Special District alone, more than 1,400 locust extermination personnel have been trained. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆、湖南、安徽治蝗准备工作基本完成
    新疆、湖南、安徽三省治蝗准备工作已基本完成。目前，三省蝗区正在严密检查蝗卵孵化情况，以便及时消灭蝗虫于三龄以前。
    新疆省除成立了省治蝗指挥部外，重点治蝗区迪化、绥来、景化、昌吉、乾德、阜康、乌苏、沙湾、和硕等九个县都成立了治蝗指挥所。最近，中共中央新疆分局第三书记张邦英、第四书记赛福鼎、新疆省人民政府副主席高锦纯等，先后到迪化等县检查治蝗准备工作，视查蝗蝻的孵化、生长情况，并听取当地各族农民、牧民对治蝗工作的意见。省里抽调的三千一百多名干部也已出发到各重点治蝗区，协助农民和牧民扑灭蝗害。各蝗区农民和牧民已准备了大量的治蝗毒饵和拌药用的麦麸等。省治蝗指挥部专门调拨了二十多辆汽车，把“六六六”药粉和喷粉器等运送到各蝗区。准备出动治蝗的飞机，正待机出动工作。
    湖南省人民政府农林厅在四月中旬就派出十八个治蝗干部，分赴去年蝗区桃江、攸县、益阳等县，指导农民侦查蝗卵孵化情况，积极准备治蝗。现在，蝗区各级治蝗指挥部、站都已成立，三千多架喷雾器和三十多万斤“六六六”药粉也已按时运到蝗区，桃江县并已训练好四百多个飞蝗侦查员和治蝗人员。
    安徽省经过严密检查后，已查明有蝗卵的土地面积共八十多万亩。为争取及早消灭蝗虫，安徽省人民政府早已指示各地作好灭蝗准备工作。现在，滁县专区各县已先后召开灭蝗代表会议，成立各级灭蝗机构，训练灭蝗人员；全专区已准备好的“六六六”药粉比去年增加了一倍，喷雾器增加了百分之五十。宿县专区仅泗洪县就已训练好一千四百多个灭蝗人员。    （新华社）
