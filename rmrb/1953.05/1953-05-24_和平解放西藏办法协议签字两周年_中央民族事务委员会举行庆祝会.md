Today, the government, army, and people of Tibet are holding warm celebrations with joy and excitement. Let us also offer our congratulations with the same feelings. In the two years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, there have been achievements and progress in all aspects. The internal unity of Tibet has been strengthened, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni have united, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet has united with the Tibetan people and the Tibetan local government. The patriotic spirit of the people of all strata in Tibet has been gradually developed, the imperialist conspiracies of sabotage have been smashed, the national defense of the great motherland has been further guaranteed, and the material and cultural life of the Tibetan people has begun to improve somewhat. These achievements are primarily attributable to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. At the same time, they are inseparable from the efforts of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and the efforts of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and the Tibetan people."
