Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: The construction work on the Kulunda to Barnaul railway line, an important section of the Soviet South Siberian Railway, has been completed. The line was opened to traffic on the 25th. On this day, trains began running from Barnaul to Kulunda. During the opening, the local people held a grand mass rally and performed entertainment programs at the currently unmapped Lebyazhye station to celebrate. This line is an important part of the Abakan to Akmolinsk section of the South Siberian Railway, which will be completed by the end of the Five-Year Plan.

During the construction process, the construction workers used various advanced technological equipment: hundreds of large excavators, bulldozers, graders, dump trucks, rail laying machines, cranes, etc. Using these machines, the construction workers piled up more than 4 million cubic meters of earth on the roadbed, poured more than 15,000 cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete, laid more than 350 kilometers of main lines and station sidings, and built dozens of turnouts in just one year. The builders built some new stations on the prairie and built workers' towns with well-equipped houses, clubs, schools, kindergartens, shops, and canteens. Houses with a living area of more than 4,000 square meters have been completed. A group of outstanding construction cadres has also been trained during the construction process. For example, the quota for excavator operator Kuzma Dochenko's team was to excavate 560 cubic meters of earth per day and night, but they excavated 1,800 cubic meters of earth per day and night.

    苏联南西伯利亚铁路线重要部分通车
    【新华社莫斯科二十七日电】苏联南西伯利亚铁路线从库伦达至巴尔瑙尔铁路干线的建筑工作已经完成。该线已于二十五日通车。这一天，列车开始从巴尔瑙尔开往库伦达。通车时当地的人在目前地图上还没有的列布立赫车站举行了盛大的群众大会并演出娱乐节目，以示庆祝。这条干线是南西伯利亚铁路线从阿巴根到阿克摩林斯克段的重要部分，全段将在五年计划末完成。
    建筑工人在建筑过程中使用了各种最新技术装备：几百台大掘土机、铲土机、推土机、自卸卡车、铺轨机、起重机等。建筑工人使用这些机器，仅在一年内就在路基上堆砌了四百多万公方泥土，浇灌了一万五千多公方混凝土和钢筋混凝土，铺了三百五十多公里干线和站内岔线，修了几十个分道叉。建筑者们在草原上盖起了一些新的车站，建设了拥有设备良好的住宅、俱乐部、学校、幼儿园、商店、食堂的工人镇。四千多平方公尺居住面积的住宅已经落成。在建筑过程中还培养了一批出色的建筑干部。例如，掘土机手库兹玛·多钦科工作组一昼夜的定额是挖掘五百六十公方泥土，但他们却在一昼夜挖掘一千八百公方泥土。
