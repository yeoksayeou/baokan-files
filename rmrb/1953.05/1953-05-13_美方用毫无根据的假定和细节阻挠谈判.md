    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 12th: This correspondent reports: At the meeting on the 11th, General Nam Il again urged the U.S. side to quickly reach an agreement on the main issues so as to enter into the agreement of specific details and achieve a Korean armistice. However, Harrison continued to raise a large number of administrative details and stated that no agreement would be reached until "satisfactory answers" were received.
    When the world is hoping for a swift agreement on the prisoner-of-war issue to achieve a Korean armistice, the armistice negotiations are facing the danger that Harrison is using the method of raising many detailed issues to obstruct the progress of the negotiations. The reason why Harrison raised a large number of unimportant questions and demanded "satisfactory answers" is nothing more than to cover up the fact that after General Nam Il put forward the new eight-point proposal, an agreement could now be reached immediately as long as the U.S. negotiating representatives really wanted an armistice.
    General Nam Il told Harrison that some of the issues raised by the U.S. side were obviously "easy to negotiate and determine after both parties reach an agreement on the main issues, and some others were not issues at all." On the 10th, Harrison raised the issue of prisoners of war who "resist explanation," which does not exist at all. This refers to the Kuomintang bandit gang and the special agents of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, who were placed in the prisoner-of-war camps to carry out terrorist rule, preventing the prisoners of war from daring to go home. These special agents are the "anti-communist prisoners of war" frequently mentioned in the statements of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp headquarters. The secret strangling, beatings, and murders in the prisoner-of-war camps were done by these special agents.
    This fact is made even clearer by Harrison's further attempt to shorten the time for fully explaining the situation to the prisoners of war. The purpose of this explanation is to eliminate the terrorist influence they have suffered and enable them to express their willingness to return home. Although the Korean-Chinese side representatives, in order to promote the progress of the meeting, have reduced the time limit of six months to four months, Harrison also said that the time limit of four months was "too long." General Nam Il told Harrison that "our side believes that the time limit of four months is completely reasonable."
    At the same time, everyone sees that the realization of the armistice has been obstructed for a year due to the U.S. side's "non-forcible repatriation," and now the U.S. side is using assumptions and questions about trivial matters to obstruct the realization of the armistice.
    Harrison's question about the final handling of prisoners of war is based on the assumption that there will still be prisoners of war under the care of neutral countries after this deadline. Now he opposes the resolution of this issue by a higher-level political conference, which is also based on the assumption that the higher-level political conference cannot resolve this issue. But he could not say why it could not be resolved. After pointing out that Harrison's assumption was unfounded, General Nam Il told Harrison that "our side firmly insists that this issue should be submitted to the political conference."
    Harrison made a big shift in raising "other" detailed "questions," which revealed the purpose of raising these questions. For more than ten days, Harrison has been telling the world that it is not necessary to know what tasks a neutral country will perform in order to nominate it. Now Harrison says, "It is impossible to imagine that any country would be willing to provide an armed force for any purpose if sufficient details are not understood regarding the issue of using this neutral country's armed forces." In fact, General Nam Il clarified the main tasks of this armed force on May 10.
    However, it can be clearly seen from the questions raised by Harrison and the reasons for the objections that the long-awaited agreement and armistice are being hindered.

### 美方用毫无根据的假定和细节阻挠谈判

    美方用毫无根据的假定和细节阻挠谈判
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者报道：在十一日会议上，南日大将又催促美方迅速对主要问题达成协议，以便进入具体细节的商定，实现朝鲜停战。但是哈利逊还是继续提出一大堆行政细节问题，并且表示，在得到“令人满意的答复”以前，是不会达成任何协议的。
    当全世界正在盼望战俘问题迅速获得协议从而实现朝鲜停战的时候，停战谈判却遭受到这样的危险：哈利逊用提出许多细节问题的方法来阻挠谈判的进展。哈利逊之所以提出一大堆无关紧要的问题，并要求“令人满意的答复”，无非是要掩盖这样一个事实，就是在南日大将提出了新的八点方案之后，只要美方谈判代表真的希望停战，现在已经可以立即达成协议。
    南日大将告诉哈利逊说，美方提出的问题有一部分显然是“在双方对主要问题达成协议后易于协商确定的，另一部分则是不能成为问题的”。哈利逊在十日提出了根本不存在的什么“抗拒解释”的战俘问题。这是指的国民党匪帮和李承晚匪帮的特务，这些特务是被安插到战俘营里去进行恐怖统治，使战俘们不敢回家的。这些特务也就是美方战俘营司令部的声明中所经常提到的“反共战俘”，战俘营中的秘密绞杀、毒打和谋杀正是这些特务干的事。
    这种事实，由于哈利逊进一步企图缩短对战俘进行充分解释的时间而显得更加明确了。这种解释的目的是要消除他们所受到的恐怖影响，并使他们能够表示回家的志愿。尽管朝中方面代表为了促进会议的进展，已经把六个月的期限减到四个月，但哈利逊还说四个月的期限“太长”。南日大将告诉哈利逊说，“我方认为四个月的期限是完全合理的。”
    同时，大家都看到，由于美方的“不强迫遣返”，停战的实现被阻挠了一年之久，现在美方又用假定和关于细微末节的问题来阻碍停战的实现了。
    哈利逊关于战俘最后处理办法的问题，是以这样一个假定做根据的，就是在这个期限以后还有战俘留在中立国的看管之下。现在他反对由高一级的政治会议解决这个问题，又是根据这样一个假定，就是高一级的政治会议是不能解决这个问题的。但是他却说不出它为什么解决不了的理由来。南日大将在指出哈利逊的假定毫无根据之后，告诉哈利逊说，“我方坚决主张这个问题应该提交政治会议。”
    哈利逊在提出“另外的”细节“问题”时，作了一个大转变，这一变却把提这些问题的目的透露出来了。十多天以来，哈利逊总是向全世界说，用不着知道一个中立国将执行什么任务就可以把它提名。现在哈利逊却说，“如果不对关于使用这个中立国武装力量的问题了解足够的详细情况，那就不可能想像有任何国家愿意为任何目的提供一支武装力量。”事实上，南日大将在五月十日已阐明了这个武装力量的主要任务。
    但是，从哈利逊所提出的问题和提出的反对理由，可以清楚地看出，全世界期待已久的协议和停战正遭受到阻碍。
