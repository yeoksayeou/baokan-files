Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd. Among the five hundred sick and wounded Korean People's Army POWs repatriated to our side by the U.S. side on April 30, three hundred and seventy-five were referred to by the U.S. side as "detained civilians." The first group of Korean People's Army POWs arriving in the morning sang "General Kim Il-sung's Song" in the U.S. vehicles. Accustomed to prohibiting POWs from singing or expressing any remembrance of their motherland, the U.S. personnel forgot to conceal their true colors in front of our receiving personnel and even opened the car doors and sternly stopped them. However, our POWs ignored him. Only when the car door was opened again and our receiving officers came to count them did they stop singing and stand up together, shouting, "Serve the Motherland!" They took advantage of the unsupervised space in the vehicles on the road from Munsan to Panmunjom, taking out small paper-made national flags that had evaded the strict U.S. inspection and wearing them on their chests. After getting out of the cars, they threw the clothing temporarily issued by the U.S. side on the ground with great disgust and resentment. One POW even burst into tears in the ambulance. He was wounded in the U.S. POW camp on March 27th this year. On that day, when our POWs sang "Democratic Youth March," U.S. soldiers opened fire and threw hand grenades at them, wounding his right foot, which is still bandaged below the knee.

These POWs, classified as "detained civilians" by the U.S. side, said that the U.S. side called them "detained civilians" in an attempt to use this as an excuse to forcibly incorporate them into the Syngman Rhee puppet army under the guise of "release." However, they absolutely did not want to kill their own compatriots for the Americans. Despite U.S. threats and oppression, they firmly demanded repatriation.

    在美方遣返给我方的病伤战俘中
    有被列为“被拘留平民”的战俘
    【新华社开城二日电】四月三十日美方遣返给我方的五百名朝鲜人民军病伤被俘人员中，有三百七十五人是被美方称为“被拘留平民”的。早晨到达的第一批朝鲜人民军被俘人员，在美方车上歌唱“金日成将军之歌”。习惯于禁止战俘唱歌或对祖国表示任何怀念的美方人员，忘记了在我方接收人员面前遮掩他的本来面目，竟然打开车门，厉声加以制止，但是我方被俘人员不去理睬他，直到车门再度打开，我方接收军官来点收时，他们才停止歌唱，一齐起立高呼：“为祖国服务！”他们利用从汶山到板门店的路上车里无人监视的空隙，拿出了瞒过美方严密检查的小小的纸制国旗，佩在胸前。下车以后，他们怀着极大的厌憎和忿恨，把美方临时发给的衣物丢在地上。有一个被俘人员还在救护车里就痛哭失声。他是在今年三月二十七日在美方战俘营中被打伤的。那天，我方被俘人员唱“民主青年进行曲”，美军士兵就向他们开枪、投手榴弹，把他的右脚打伤，到现在膝关节以下还包扎着。
    这些被美方分类为“被拘留平民”的我方被俘人员说：美方把他们称为“被拘留平民”，是想以此为借口，假“释放”之名，把他们强迫编入李承晚伪军，但是他们绝对不愿替美国人残杀自己的同胞，尽管美方威胁和压迫，他们仍然坚决要求遣返。
