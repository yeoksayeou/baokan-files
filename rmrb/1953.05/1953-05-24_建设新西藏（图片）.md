Building a New Tibet

    May 23rd marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. Over the past two years, the Tibetan people, within the embrace of the motherland, have enjoyed national equality, freedom of religious belief, and all other rights they are entitled to, gradually realizing a peaceful and happy life. This is a scene of the Chinese People's Liberation Army entering Lhasa, passing in front of the Potala Palace, in accordance with the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet faithfully implement the agreement, actively reclaiming wasteland for production and building transportation infrastructure, making a good start in improving and raising the material living standards of the Tibetan people. This is a scene of the People's Liberation Army soldiers completing a 20-li-long irrigation canal and releasing water to irrigate the fields before planting.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops and personnel stationed in Tibet have established a profound friendship of unity and amity with the Tibetan people. The soldiers often take time to help the Tibetan people with their work, and the Tibetan people present hadas to the People's Liberation Army to express their gratitude. On National Day in 1952, people from all walks of life in Lhasa held a grand celebration parade.
    On the "August 1st" Army Day in 1952, Tibetan youths in Lhasa and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army held a grand get-together to celebrate this great festival.
    Tibet has vast agricultural areas. The alluvial plains of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Lhasa River are fertile and have a warm climate, and are known as the "Granary of Tibet"; therefore, the prospects for the development of agricultural production in Tibet are bright. This is a scene of the People's Liberation Army helping Tibetan people harvest wheat.
    The Tashilhunpo Monastery, built in Shigatse, the capital of Rear Tibet, is the residence of successive Panchen Lamas.
    Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, industry and commerce have gradually prospered, and material exchanges have begun to become frequent. Many deserted ferries in the past have gradually become bustling.
    In the past two years, people's hospitals or clinics have been established in major towns in Tibet, greatly alleviating the suffering of the Tibetan people from diseases. In order to help the Tibetan people eliminate smallpox, the People's Liberation Army has also set up many free vaccination stations in Tibet.
    Large quantities of medical supplies are continuously transported to Tibet using various means of transportation.
    The Tibetan people working in the People's Liberation Army clothing factory have learned to use sewing machines with the enthusiastic help and guidance of the staff.
    In order to help the Tibetan people gradually restore and develop agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce, the Central People's Government has established institutions such as the People's Bank of China and trade companies in Tibet to issue agricultural and pastoral loans and purchase Tibetan people's largest income-generating wool at reasonable prices. This is a scene of the Lhasa people holding a celebration meeting in front of the People's Bank square on National Day in 1952.
    The People's Liberation Army and personnel stationed in Tibet often publicize the various policies of the Central People's Government to the Tibetan people, enabling the vast Tibetan people to gain a great deal of progressive knowledge. This is a scene of the People's Liberation Army distributing pictorials to the Tibetan people.
    Tibet has vast and fertile natural pastures. The wool, leather, butter, and meat produced in various pastoral areas, in addition to meeting the needs of the Tibetan people, can also be exported in large quantities every year.

    建设新西藏
    五月二十三日是和平解放西藏办法的协议签订两周年纪念日。两年来，西藏民族在祖国大家庭中，享受着民族平等、宗教信仰自由及其他应享的一切权利，逐步地实现着和平愉快的幸福生活。这是根据和平解放西藏办法的协议进驻西藏的中国人民解放军进抵拉萨时通过布达拉宫前的情形。
    中国人民解放军驻藏部队忠实地执行协议，积极开荒生产，修筑交通等，为改善和提高西藏人民的物质生活做了良好的开端。这是人民解放军战士们修好了一条长二十华里的大水渠，在播种前放水灌田的情形。
    中国人民解放军驻藏部队与工作人员，已和西藏人民建立了团结友爱的深厚友谊，战士们时常抽出时间来帮助西藏人民工作，藏胞向解放军献哈达表示感谢。一九五二年国庆节，拉萨市各界人民举行了隆重的庆祝游行。
    一九五二年“八一”建军节，拉萨市藏族青年们和解放军战士举行盛大的联欢会来庆祝这个伟大的节日。
    西藏有着广大的农业区。雅鲁藏布江和拉萨河流域的冲积平原，土地肥沃，气候温暖，被称为“西藏粮仓”；因此西藏农业生产的发展前途是远大的。这是解放军帮助藏民收割小麦的情形。
    建筑在后藏首府日喀则的扎什伦布寺，是历代班禅居住的地方。
    西藏和平解放后，工商业逐渐繁荣起来了，物资交流也开始频繁起来了，过去许多冷落的渡口，现在都渐渐热闹起来了。
    两年来，在西藏各主要城镇都已设立了人民医院或诊疗所，大大减轻了藏族人民疾病的痛苦。人民解放军为了帮助藏族人民消除天花病害，又在西藏设立了许多义务种痘站。
    大批医药物资利用各种不同的交通工具，源源运抵西藏。
    在人民解放军被服厂里工作的藏族人民，由于工作人员的热心帮助指导，都已学会使用缝纫机了。
    中央人民政府为了帮助西藏人民逐步恢复和发展农牧工商业，在西藏设立了中国人民银行和贸易公司等机构，发放农牧贷款和以合理价格收购西藏人民最大收入的羊毛等。这是一九五二年国庆节，拉萨市人民在人民银行前广场上举行庆祝会的情形。
    驻藏人民解放军和工作人员，经常向藏族人民宣传中央人民政府的各种政策，使广大的藏族人民获得了许多进步的知识。这是解放军在分送画报给藏族人民时的情形。
    西藏有着广阔丰茂的天然牧场，各牧区出产的羊毛、皮革、酥油和肉类，除供西藏人民的需要外，每年还可以大量外销。
