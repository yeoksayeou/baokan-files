    Since the establishment of the marriage registration system in Cheng Guan District, Shan County, Shandong Province in early 1952, the district's civil affairs officer has been specially responsible for it, and the leadership has also regularly paid attention to inspection and summarization. Over the past year, the district has made many achievements in marriage registration work.

    When handling marriage registration work, Cheng Guan District of Shan County pays attention to regularly and conscientiously explaining the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and the benefits of marriage registration to the registrants. Many parties involved did not understand the Marriage Law and came to register without meeting the requirements. After listening to the explanation, they all automatically expressed their support for the Marriage Law and their willingness to act in accordance with it. For example, Wan Daoguang, a resident of Wenmiao Street, falsely reported his age to request marriage registration. After Wang Jielian, the civil affairs officer of the district, explained the reasons to him, he voluntarily stopped the registration. He said: "The Marriage Law is really thoughtful, we can't but implement it!" Some parties involved were not voluntarily entering into marriage, but lacked the courage to fight. After being educated during registration, they improved their understanding and increased their courage, and fought against the feudal marriage system, achieving victory. For example, Li Xiulian's marriage was entirely arranged by her parents. Her parents only told her about the marriage two days before the registration. Her mother also threatened her, saying, "If you agree, you can have whatever clothes you want. If you say you disagree at the district, we'll fight to the death." When she went to the district to register, Li Xiulian was unwilling, but seeing her mother's expression, she dared not say she disagreed, and was so sad that she shed tears. Comrade Wang Jielian saw this and guessed what was going on. So he patiently explained the Marriage Law to them, explaining the disadvantages of arranged marriages and the benefits of marital autonomy. He explained that past marriages arranged by parents were invalid if the children did not agree, and that marriage should be voluntary on both the man and woman's part, and no one could force or interfere. Then he educated both parties separately, stating that the People's Government firmly supports young men and women in striving for marital freedom. In this way, Li Xiulian told the story and immediately expressed her disagreement to marry this unknown man. Comrade Wang Jielian also re-educated both parents and dissolved Li Xiulian's marriage contract. Afterwards, Comrade Wang Jielian estimated that Li Xiulian would still encounter obstacles after returning home, so he went to Li's home to visit in the afternoon. Sure enough, Xiulian's mother felt that this matter was "too embarrassing" and insisted on driving Xiulian out of the house. After a long period of persuasion and education, Xiulian's mother was finally convinced.

    In the marriage registration work, in addition to generally publicizing the Marriage Law and improving the understanding of the parties involved, the district can also carry out fully responsible handling until the problem is completely resolved. For example, the granddaughter of Guo Shichun in Beiguanwai was dissatisfied with her grandfather's arranged marriage for her and went to the district to dissolve the marriage contract. After Guo Shichun found out, he forced her to go to the twelfth district where the man lived to register before his granddaughter returned home. The twelfth district office did not understand the situation and registered them carelessly without waiting for the woman to express her opinion. The woman cried non-stop after returning home. Someone reported this matter to Cheng Guan District, and Wang Jielian and another comrade personally went to Guo's house to educate Guo Shichun, explaining that parents could offer opinions on their children's marriage, but they must not force them if the children did not agree. He gave many examples to show that old people should love their children, and in marriage matters, they should let their children make their own decisions. After repeated education, Guo Shichun's thinking was straightened out, and he was determined not to arrange his granddaughter's marriage again. The district also held a mass meeting on this example and carried out extensive publicity and education, which had a great impact on the masses.

    山东单县城关区认真进行婚姻登记工作
    山东省单县城关区自一九五二年初建立婚姻登记制度后，就由区民政干事专门负责，领导方面也经常注意检查总结。一年多来，该区在结婚登记工作方面，已做出许多成绩。
    单县城关区在办理结婚登记工作时，注意经常认真地向登记人讲解婚姻法的基本精神和进行婚姻登记的好处。不少当事人不了解婚姻法，不够条件即来登记，听了解释后，都自动地表示拥护婚姻法，愿意按照婚姻法办事。如文庙街居民万道光虚报年龄要求登记结婚，经过区民政干事王介廉讲清道理后，自动地停止了登记。他说：“婚姻法真周到，咱不能不执行！”有的当事人的婚姻不是自愿，但又缺乏斗争勇气；在登记时受到教育后，提高了认识，增加了勇气，即向封建婚姻制度作斗争，得到了胜利。如李秀莲的婚姻是她父母一手包办的。登记前两天，她父母才把结婚的事告诉她。她母亲还威胁她说：“你要是愿意，要啥衣服有啥衣服。到了区上你要说不同意，就拚个你死我活。”到区上登记时，李秀莲满心不愿意，可是看见她母亲的脸色，又不敢说不同意，难过得直流泪。王介廉同志一看，就猜透了八、九分。于是耐心地给她们讲解婚姻法，说明包办婚姻的坏处和婚姻自主的好处。说明过去由父母包办订的婚，儿女不同意就无效，婚姻要由男女两方自愿，任何人不能强迫和干涉。接着又分别向男女双方进行教育，表明人民政府是坚决支持青年男女争取婚姻自由的。这样，李秀莲就诉说了事情的经过，当场表示不同意和这个不相识的男人结婚。王介廉同志又重新对双方的家长进行说服教育，解除了李秀莲的婚约。事后，王介廉同志估计到李秀莲回家后还会遭到阻难，又在下午去李家探望。果然，秀莲母亲感到这事“太丢人”了，一定要把秀莲赶出门去。经过长时间的劝解教育，终于说服了秀莲的母亲。
    该区在结婚登记工作中，除了一般地宣传婚姻法、提高当事人的认识外，还能进行完全负责的处理，一直到问题彻底解决。如北关外郭世春的孙女不满意她祖父包办她的婚姻，到区上解除了婚约。郭世春知道后，不等孙女回家，就又逼着她到男方住的十二区去登记。十二区区公所不了解情况，没等女方表示意见，就马马虎虎地给登记了。女的回家后痛哭不止。有人把这事反映到城关区，王介廉和另一同志就亲自到郭家去，向郭世春进行教育，说明儿女的婚姻家长提意见是可以的，但儿女不同意就决不能强迫。并举出许多实例，说明当老人的要爱护孩子，在婚姻问题上就应该让孩子自己作主。经过多次反复教育，郭世春的思想通了，决心不再包办孙女的婚姻。区里并就这一事例，召开群众大会，进行了广泛的宣传教育，在群众中发生很大的影响。
