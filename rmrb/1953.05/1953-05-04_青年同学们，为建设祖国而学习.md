Young students, study to build the motherland.

The fundamental task of youth is to study. Especially as our motherland begins to implement new economic construction, study becomes an even more prominent task for Chinese youth. We Chinese youth are not only heroic defenders of the motherland but also will be outstanding builders of the new China. Therefore, we must not only strive to study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, study the policies of the CPC Central Committee and the People's Government, and study culture, but also must study modern science and technology, and learn various knowledge for building the motherland. Otherwise, we will be detached from the needs of the motherland, detached from the hopes of the people, and will not be able to fulfill our due responsibilities in the various constructions of the motherland.

In the past four years of experience, the youth of New China have no difficulty in understanding that Chairman Mao and the People's Government have shown meticulous care for the youth and have attached great importance to the cultivation of the youth. Our learning environment and conditions have been greatly improved. Not only do we have relatively good learning conditions in schools, but also the government has arranged all possible learning conditions for the youth in production posts and in the posts of government organizations. The motherland gives us a lot, but also demands a lot from us. The motherland has already placed the great task of industrialization before our people, especially our youth. Carrying out industrialization on the vast land of the motherland is not a simple matter; this is unprecedented. What we are going to carry out is by no means some fragmented industrial construction, we will be carrying out advanced and new industrial construction.

Therefore, the purpose of our youth's study is for the bright future of the motherland and also for our own happy life. If we truly connect the glorious future of the motherland with our own learning today, and regard the development of every mineral resource in the motherland, the laying of every railway and highway, and the establishment of every factory and enterprise as the goals and objects of our learning today, then we will realize how important our learning task is, and we will ask ourselves to study diligently and tirelessly, and learn real skills, so that we can serve the construction of the motherland well.

Today, the vast majority of young people have initially recognized their glorious responsibilities, so they are generally enthusiastic and serious in their studies. However, there are still many people who lack a firm spirit because their learning motives are not pure enough. They become arrogant and complacent when their grades are slightly better; they become pessimistic and disappointed when they encounter slight setbacks in their studies. They never think that their good or bad studies are the key to whether they will do a good or bad job for the country in the future. If his learning goal is pure, that is, for the construction of the motherland, then when he sees some results in his studies, he should immediately summarize the experience of learning and apply these experiences to future learning in order to learn better and serve the country better. When he encounters slight setbacks in his studies, he should examine the reasons for the setbacks, remember the lessons, correct the mistakes, and continue to work hard.

The cadres needed for the construction of the motherland are diverse. Each type of cadre must have relatively in-depth professional knowledge. Some cadres are in urgent demand, some are relatively moderate, some are needed in large quantities, and some can be less. Since we have realized that the purpose of our study is to build the motherland, then, according to the needs of the motherland and our own conditions, it is necessary to choose a major as our goal of effort. Once a major has been chosen, then we should work hard, overcome all difficulties in learning, and carry out learning. We must never want to change careers when we encounter slight difficulties, and think that we have learned the wrong industry, be fickle, learn this industry today, learn that industry tomorrow, and repeatedly waver, wasting years, and in the end, we are not proficient in any industry, causing irreparable losses to the country's plan to train cadres. In fact, all cadres are equally important to the construction of the motherland. Every screw in a machine has its own specific function. Cadres are like various parts in a machine for the construction of the country. They all have their own special functions. Only their good cooperation can make our motherland strong and developed. However, in today's youth team, there are indeed some prejudices left over from the old society, such as "liberal arts are not as good as science, science is not as good as engineering," and when learning engineering, "operation is not as good as construction," and "construction is not as good as design." These prejudices of the old society poison our youth, making our youth blurred in the choice of majors, and unable to see the needs of the motherland. Therefore, we must strengthen the education of youth in choosing majors. But on the other hand, we are against premature specialization. We are against young people thinking that they are experts in a certain industry in middle school and abandoning other courses regardless. We are against the learning tendency that only values mathematics, physics, and chemistry while ignoring Chinese, history, and geography. We are also against the tendency of those who think they are writers and regard mathematics as a thorn in their side. We are also against the tendency of only valuing the so-called "regular courses" while ignoring the learning of music, sports, and art. In a country where the people have mastered political power, our youth must become all-round developed people with intelligence, morality, physique, and aesthetics. We must move towards socialism, and finally towards communism. Only when we have mastered the complete and systematic sum of human knowledge can we more deeply understand the laws of social development and natural development, so as to transform the world and build a happy new society. Even in secondary technical schools, we also emphasize the requirement that students have the necessary cultural and scientific basic knowledge and a scientific world outlook, and master professional technical knowledge in one aspect on this basis. But today, whether in colleges and universities or in secondary schools, the idea of premature and narrow specialization is widespread. For example, students in higher industrial schools generally do not pay attention to the study of chemistry, and cannot see that chemistry is the basic discipline for mastering the properties of engineering materials and media. We also noticed the generally low level of Chinese proficiency in engineering colleges, to the extent that even the ability to take notes and express opinions in writing is very weak, which greatly affects their learning efficiency. Strictly speaking, their intellectual development is abnormal. Such students are naturally difficult to become true specialists. The expertise we require must have a broad and deep foundation. We must develop our expertise by learning basic courses well, so that we can truly use our expertise and strive creatively for the construction of the motherland in various complex situations.

The demand for premature specialization is a manifestation of impetuousness. In today's youth's daily learning, various kinds of impetuousness are also revealed everywhere. These emotions seriously affect the learning effect. When learning physics and mathematics, many people rush to do exercises before they understand the principles, and in the end, those who learn mathematics and physics become experts in doing arithmetic problems. He spent a lot of effort, but he still only has a superficial understanding of the systematic scientific theoretical knowledge, that is, the objective laws, included in these basic sciences, so that it is impossible to exert the role that basic scientific knowledge should play when learning a major. When learning Russian, they only pay attention to memorizing new words, hoping to be able to read and write as soon as possible, ignoring grammar and the changes in word endings, so that the effect is not great, and they often rework. These young students ignore the systematic nature of science, and ignore that the learning of scientific knowledge can only be learned step by step from shallow to deep in a gradual manner in order to learn solidly. Learning science is like climbing a peak. Only with step-by-step hard and lasting labor can we achieve our goal. There can be no falsehood or impetuousness. The experience of many young people points out that whoever can overcome the impetuous and greedy emotions, whoever can follow a certain learning plan, and learn step by step systematically in a certain order, can transform from passive to active in learning, and can learn deeply in a down-to-earth manner.

When a young person's learning motivation is correct, the professional requirements are also determined, and the learning emotions are no longer impetuous but can be gradual, then he has the main conditions for down-to-earth learning. But to cultivate oneself into a construction cadre who is truly useful to the motherland, in addition to learning some scientific and technological knowledge, we must consciously cultivate our ability to work independently and think independently. In the construction work of the motherland, the situations and problems encountered will be very complex. If we cannot actively and independently discover problems and solve problems, we will not be able to build the motherland very effectively, that is to say, we must not only understand objective laws, but also learn to independently and creatively use these objective laws.

In the current colleges and universities, many students do not have enough training in independent thinking. No matter how big or small things are, they want teachers to answer them without thinking. Usually after doing exercises, they rarely think about it themselves and try to judge whether it is right or wrong. Therefore, whether teachers answer questions or students do exercises, they rarely receive the due effect. Many students pay attention only to the collection of teaching materials and data. They only learn a pile of dead knowledge, and have not or rarely gone through thinking, so it is impossible to have an in-depth understanding. But the builders of the motherland cannot always have teachers following them to judge whether the design or the solution to the problem is correct. Therefore, planned cultivation of the ability to think and judge and analyze independently will be one of the main tasks in our youth's current learning.

We young people have grown up under the cultivation of the motherland. We will effectively inherit the previous generation to build our great motherland. Our task is arduous, but with the leadership of Chairman Mao, as long as we strive to overcome shortcomings and difficulties, we will surely become competent builders of the motherland.

    青年同学们，为建设祖国而学习
    清华大学教务长　钱伟长
    青年的基本任务是学习。特别是当我们祖国开始实行新的经济建设的时候，学习就成为中国青年更加突出的任务。我们中国青年不但是祖国的英勇保卫者，而且将是新中国的优秀建设者。因此，我们不但要努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作，学习中共中央和人民政府的政策，学习文化，而且必须学习现代科学技术，学习建设祖国的各种知识，否则，我们将脱离祖国的需要，脱离人民的希望，在祖国各种建设中也便不能尽到应有的责任。
    新中国青年们在过去四年的经验里，不难体会到毛主席和人民政府对于青年的关怀是无微不至的，对于青年的培养是十分重视的。我们的学习环境和条件是大大改善了，不但在学校里有了比较良好的学习条件，就是在生产岗位上，在机关工作岗位上，政府也给青年安排了一切可能的学习条件。祖国给我们的多，但向我们要求的也多。祖国已经把工业化的伟大任务放在我国人民尤其是我们青年面前。在宽广的祖国土地上进行工业化不是简单的事情，这是史无前例的。我们要进行的绝不是一些支离破碎的工业建设，我们将要进行先进的新型的工业建设。
    因此，我们青年学习的目的是为了祖国的美好将来，也是为了自己的幸福生活。假如我们真切地把祖国的光辉前途和今天自己的学习联系起来，把祖国每一处矿产资源的开发，把每一条铁道公路的铺设，把每一个工厂企业的建立，都看作是我们今天学习的目标和对象，那么我们就会体会到我们的学习任务如何重大，就会要求自己踏踏实实地不懈地去学习，学会真本领，这样才可以很好地为祖国的建设服务。
    今天极大多数青年已经初步认识了自己的光荣责任，所以在学习上一般是热情且又认真的。但是也还有不少人由于学习动机还不够纯正，所以就缺乏坚毅精神，当自己成绩稍好时就骄傲自满；当自己学习稍有挫折时就悲观失望，他从来也想不到他的学好和学坏就是将来他为国家办事时办好和办坏的关键。他的学习目标如果是纯正的，是为了祖国建设，那末他在学习稍见功效时，便应该即时总结学习的经验，把这些经验贯彻到以后的学习中去，以期学得更好，可以更好地为国家办事。他在学习稍遇挫折时，便应该检查遇到挫折的原因，牢记教训，改正错误，再接再厉地努力下去。
    祖国建设所需要的干部是多种多样的，每一种干部都要具有比较深入的专业知识，有些干部需要得紧，有些比较缓和，有些需要得量多，有些比较可以少些。我们既然认识了我们学习的目的是为了建设祖国，那末，根据祖国的需要，和自己的条件，择定一项专业，作为自己努力的目标，是必要的了。既已择定了专业，那便应该刻苦努力，克服一切学习上的困难，来进行学习。绝不能稍有困难便想转业，便自以为学错了行业，见异思迁，今天学这行，明天学那行，反复摇摆，浪费年月，到头来一行不精，给国家培养干部的计划造成不可弥补的损失。其实一切干部对祖国建设说来都是同等地重要，一架机器里每一只螺丝钉都有它一定的功用，干部对于国家的建设，犹如机器里的各种零件，他们都有各自的特殊功用，只有他们的良好配合才可以使我们祖国强大发展。但是在今天的青年队伍里，确实还存在着旧社会遗留给我们的一些偏见，例如“文不如理，理不如工”，学工时，“运转不如施工”，“施工不如设计”，这些旧社会的偏见，毒害着我们青年，使我们青年在选择专业的问题上模糊了，看不见祖国的需要。因此，我们对青年选择专业的教育必需加强。但是在另一方面，我们却反对过早的专业化，我们反对青年在中学时代就自以为是某某行业的专家而把其他课程抛弃不管，我们反对只重视数学、物理、化学而忽视国文、历史、地理的那种学习倾向，我们也反对那种自以为是文学家而把数学看成眼中钉的倾向，我们也反对只重视所谓的“正课”而忽视音乐、体育、美术学习的倾向。在人民掌握了政权的国家里，我们青年要成为智德体美全面发展的人，我们要走向社会主义，最后要走向共产主义；只有当我们掌握了完整系统的人类知识的总和后，才能更深刻地认识到社会发展和自然界发展的规律，从而来改造世界，建设幸福的新社会。就是在中等技术学校里，我们也强调要求学生有必要的文化科学基础知识和科学的世界观，在这样的基础上掌握某一方面的专业技术知识。但是今天不论在高等学校里和中等学校里，过早的狭隘的专业化的思想是普遍存在的，譬如同学们在高等工业学校里一般不注意化学的学习，看不见化学是掌握工程材料和介质性质的基础学科。我们也觉察到在工学院里一般语文程度的低劣，以至连记笔记和书面表达意见的能力都非常薄弱，这样就大大影响了他的学习效率。严格说来他们在知识上的发育是不正常的，这样的学生自然也很难成为真正的专门人才。我们所要求的专长，要有宽广深厚的基础，要在学好基础课上来发展我们的专长，这样我们才能真正运用我们的专长，在种种复杂的情况下，创造地为祖国建设而努力。
    过早的专业化要求是急躁情绪的一种表现。在今天青年的日常学习里，也还处处表露着各种各样的急躁情绪。这些情绪，严重地影响着学习效果。在学物理数学时，有不少人在还没有弄懂原则时便抢着做习题，到头来弄得学数理的变成了做算题的专家。他化费了很多的力量，但对于这些基础科学所包括的系统科学理论知识即客观规律还只是一知半解，以致在学到专业时便不可能发挥基础科学知识所应该发挥的作用。在学习俄文时只注意背忆生字，希望早日能看书识字，忽略文法和字尾的变化，以至成效不大，常常返工。这些青年同学忽视了科学的系统性，忽视了科学知识的学习是只有一点一滴地由浅入深地循序渐进才能学得踏实。学习科学好像攀登高峰，只有用一步一步艰苦和持久的劳动，才能达到目的，来不得半点虚假急躁的。许多青年的经验指出，谁要能克服了急躁贪多的情绪，谁要能遵循一定的学习计划，按着一定的顺序，一点一滴系统地学习，谁就能在学习里从被动转入主动，就能踏踏实实地学得深入。
    当一个青年的学习动机端正了，专业要求也肯定了，学习情绪也不再急躁而能循序渐进了之后，那便具备了踏踏实实学习的主要条件，但是要把自己培养成为对祖国真正有用的建设干部，我们除了学习一些科学技术知识外，我们必需有意识地培养自己的独立工作独立思考的能力。在祖国的建设工作里，所遇到的情况和问题将是非常复杂的，我们如果不能主动地独立地发现问题和解决问题，我们就不可能很有效地建设祖国，那就是说，我们不仅要懂得客观规律，并且要学会独立地创造地运用这些客观规律。
    在目前的高等学校里，许多同学的独立思考的锻炼是不够的，事无大小，不经思考，就要教师来解答。平常做完习题，很少自己思考一下，尝试着来判别对或不对。因此，不论教师答复问题或者学生作习题，便都很少收到应有的效果。许多同学所注意的只是教材资料的收集，他们只学了一堆死知识，没有或很少经过思考，所以便不可能有深入的了解。但是祖国的建设者们不可能老有教师跟着他们来判别设计或问题解法的是否正确，因此有计划地来培养独立思考和独立判断分析的能力，将是我们青年目前学习中的主要任务之一。
    我们青年在祖国的培养下成长了起来，我们将有效地继承前一代人来建设我们的伟大祖国，我们的任务是艰巨的，但是，我们有毛主席的领导，我们只要努力克服缺点和困难，就一定能成为称职的祖国建设者。
