Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 29th (TASS dispatch): A "New York Times" reporter telegraphed from Cincinnati (Ohio) a speech by Senator Taft, which Taft delivered at a banquet hosted by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.

Taft said: "Regarding the Korean War, we might as well forget the United Nations. I think that now we should do our best to conduct armistice negotiations, and if we fail, then let Britain and our other allies know that we will withdraw from all future peace negotiations in Korea. I think we had better abandon any idea of working with the United Nations in the East and retain the right to act with complete freedom."

According to the "New York Times," Taft also said that it seems that no foreign policy problem faced by the United States can be "satisfactorily resolved," and he said: "In the past three years, whether the Democratic or Republican Party was in power, the foreign policy of the United States has been based on a policy of total opposition to communism as an ideology expanding beyond its current scope... Of course, our policy does not rely on the United Nations or any other country to decide... This is not a policy pursued through the United Nations, but a military alliance policy."

Regarding the Korean armistice negotiations, Taft said: "Under the current circumstances, even the most perfect armistice is absolutely unsatisfactory. This armistice will divide Korea along an artificial line and create an unstable situation that could lead to war again at any moment. From the beginning, we should have insisted on comprehensive peace negotiations with China, including the issue of unifying Korea under a free Korea (which is what Taft calls Syngman Rhee) and guaranteeing no further expansion in Southeast Asia.

Once we achieve the current armistice, no matter what terms we stipulate in the agreement on the future unification of Korea, the possibility of unifying Korea will not be greater than the possibility of unifying Germany."

After Taft spoke about the idea that the United States could abandon working with the United Nations in the East, he said: "These words may surprise many people who still believe in the United Nations. I myself believe in the United Nations, but I don't think it is an effective tool to prevent aggression. The United Nations does have many peaceful means of persuasion to prevent and prevent war. I think we should convene a conference to amend the Charter. However, people should not be surprised by my suggestion regarding the United Nations in Korea, because we have actually completely abandoned the United Nations in Europe. We did not ask for the United Nations' permission when we signed the North Atlantic Treaty, nor did we consult with the United Nations. Recent events in France and Britain indicate that they are eager to solve problems with Russia and restore as much trade as possible..."

An Associated Press reporter also reported from Cincinnati that Taft, in his speech, called the North Atlantic Group "completely contradictory" to the United Nations Charter. He said that in addition to relying on the United Nations' "ineffective efforts" in Korea, the United States has consistently implemented a military alliance policy of "containing communism."

"After the agreement was signed with Greece and Turkey, and an agreement with Spain is being considered, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has clearly become an old-fashioned military alliance... We are really trying to arm the world against the communist Soviet Union, or at least provide all assistance that is beneficial to them in opposing communism.

"Is this policy of uniting the free world (which is Taft's name for capitalist countries) against communism in peacetime a practical long-term policy? I have always expressed doubts about whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is militarily feasible. I am not a military expert, but I have never heard arguments that have impressed me, explaining how American ground forces can effectively defend Europe.

"Of course, it seems that we have undertaken the task of defending countries like Norway and Denmark, which are almost impossible to defend themselves once they are suddenly attacked by Russia.

"I have always felt that we should not try to fight Russia on the European continent, just as we should not try to fight China on the Asian continent. I have always felt that the defense work must be undertaken by the Western Europeans themselves. They have at least 225 million people—50 percent more than we do in the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 30th (TASS dispatch): U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference on May 28th.

The main topic of this press conference was the speech given by Republican Senator Taft in Cincinnati.

Someone asked Eisenhower if he shared Taft's opinion that the United States should put the United Nations aside in the Korean War. Eisenhower evaded the question, saying that sometimes, any one country acting alone may achieve more than striving for consensus. But he said that it is impossible to single out a few points to reach a consensus.

A reporter pointed out Taft's words that if an armistice cannot be achieved, the United States must act alone. Eisenhower replied that Taft must have meant that the United States will firmly adhere to its own views and beliefs, rather than saying that it would drive everyone away. Eisenhower said that there are some unclear points in this regard that he could not understand. Differences of opinion on the armistice do not mean that friends become enemies.

The reporter then quoted a sentence from Taft's speech (Eisenhower said he had not looked at the speech in detail): If an armistice cannot be achieved, the United States should tell Britain and France that the United States will withdraw from subsequent peace negotiations. Eisenhower replied that Taft did not say that the United States should leave its allies. Eisenhower also said that Britain and France might agree to this suggestion.

Then someone asked Eisenhower if he agreed with the opinions expressed earlier by Churchill and former French Prime Minister Mayer that the Bermuda conference would lead to a meeting of four representatives. Eisenhower did not answer this question directly. He said that the trilateral conference is "important in itself." If the Bermuda conference leads to a later four-power conference, it is because certain developments in the situation would make it appropriate. He also said that the Bermuda conference would not necessarily lead to such a meeting.

Eisenhower said that the United States will continue to oppose the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.

### 美参议员塔夫脱叫嚣要“行动自由”阻挠协商  艾森豪威尔答记者问掩饰他们的内部矛盾

    美参议员塔夫脱叫嚣要“行动自由”阻挠协商
    艾森豪威尔答记者问掩饰他们的内部矛盾
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日电：“纽约时报”一个记者自辛辛那提（俄亥俄州）用电报发出参议员塔夫脱的一篇演说，塔夫脱这篇演说是在全国基督教与犹太教会议主办的一次宴会上发表的。
    塔夫脱说：“就朝鲜战争而论，我们不如忘掉联合国。我认为：现在我们应该尽力进行停战谈判，如果我们失败了，那么，就让英国与我们的其他盟国知道，我们将退出以后在朝鲜进行的一切和平谈判。我认为，我们最好放弃在东方与联合国一起工作的任何想法，而使我们保留完全自由行动的权利。”
    据“纽约时报”说：塔夫脱还说，看来美国所面临的任何外交政策问题都不会获得“满意的解决”，他并且说：“在以往三年中，不论是民主党或共和党当政，美国的外交政策都是以全面反对共产主义作为一种思想向它目前的范围以外扩张这一个方针为基础的。……当然，我们的政策并不依靠联合国或任何其他国家来决定……这并不是通过联合国而推行的政策，而是一个军事联盟政策。”
    关于朝鲜停战谈判问题，塔夫脱说：“在目前的情况下，即使是最完善的停战也是绝对不能令人满意的。这个停战将按照一条人为的界线来分裂朝鲜，并制造一种在任何时刻都会再度引起战争的不稳定的情况。从一开始，我们就应该坚持与中国进行全面和平的谈判，其中包括在自由朝鲜（这就是塔夫脱所说的李承晚）之下进行统一朝鲜以及保证不得在东南亚作进一步的扩张等问题。
    如果我们一旦实现目前的停战，不论我们在关于以后统一朝鲜的谈判的协议中规定一些什么条款，统一朝鲜的可能性都不会比统一德国的可能性为大。”
    塔夫脱讲了美国可以放弃在东方和联合国一同工作的意见后说：“这种话可能使很多目前还相信联合国的人感觉惊奇。我自己也相信联合国，但认为它不是阻止侵略的一个有效工具。联合国确实也有许多用和平说服的和平方法来阻止和预防战争。我认为我们应召集一个修改宪章的会议。然而，人们不应该对我关于联合国在朝鲜的建议觉得惊异，因为我们在欧洲实际上就完全放弃了联合国。我们通过北大西洋公约时也没有要求联合国的允许，我们也没有和联合国商量。最近法英两国发生的事情表示它们满心想和俄国解决问题，恢复尽可能多的贸易……。”
    美联社一个记者另外从辛辛那提报道说，塔夫脱在他的演说中称北大西洋集团是和联合国宪章“完全矛盾的”，他说，除了依靠联合国在朝鲜的“无效努力”外，美国始终如一地执行着“阻制共产主义”的军事联盟政策。
    “在希腊和土耳其订立协定，并考虑和西班牙签订协议以后，北大西洋公约组织显然成了一种老式的军事同盟……。我们真正是在试图武装世界来对付共产党苏联，或者，至少是供给对他们反对共产主义有裨益的一切援助。
    “这种联合自由世界（这是塔夫脱对于资本主义国家的称号）在和平时期来反对共产主义的政策是切实可行的长期政策吗？我对于北大西洋公约组织在军事上是否切实可行一直是表示怀疑的。我不是一个军事专家，但是我从来没有听见过使我印象很深的论点，说明美国的地面部队能够有效地保卫欧洲。
    “当然，看起来我们好像已经承担了保卫像挪威、丹麦这样的国家的工作，这些国家一旦遭受到俄国的突然攻击，差不多是不可能保卫自己的。
    “我一直觉得我们不应该企图在欧洲大陆上与俄国作战，正如我们不应企图在亚洲大陆与中国作战。我一直觉得防御工作必须由西欧人自己承担起来。他们至少有两亿两千五百万人——比我们美国多百分之五十的人。”
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社华盛顿三十日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔在五月二十八日举行了一次记者招待会。
    这一招待会主要是讨论共和党参议员塔夫脱在辛辛那提城发表的演说。
    有人问艾森豪威尔是否和塔夫脱有同样的意见，认为美国在朝鲜战争中应该把联合国置之脑后。艾森豪威尔闪避其词地回答说：有时候，任何一个国家单独地干，可能会比努力求得一致意见所得的成就来得多。但是他说，单单选定某几点来求得一致意见是不可能的。
    有一个记者指出塔夫脱的话，如果停战不能实现，美国必须单独干下去。艾森豪威尔回答说，塔夫脱的意思一定是说，美国将坚决遵循它自己的见解与信念，而不是说要把每一个人都赶出去。艾森豪威尔说，在这方面有些不明白的地方，是他所不能理解的。在停战方面的意见分歧并不意味着朋友变成了仇敌。
    这个记者接着援引塔夫脱的演说（艾森豪威尔说他没有详细看过这篇演说）中的一句话：如果停战不能实现，美国应当对英国和法国说，美国将退出此后的和平谈判。艾森豪威尔回答说，塔夫脱并没有说美国应当离开它的盟国，艾森豪威尔还说，英国和法国也许会同意这个建议。
    接着有人问艾森豪威尔，他是否同意早先邱吉尔和前法国总理迈耶发表的意见，认为百慕大会议将导致四国代表的会议。艾森豪威尔没有正面回答这个问题。他说，三国会议“本身”就是重要的。如果百慕大会议导致了以后的四国会议，那是因为局势的某些发展会使得它应当如此。他又说，百慕大会议并不一定会导致这样的会议。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国将继续反对让中华人民共和国加入联合国。
