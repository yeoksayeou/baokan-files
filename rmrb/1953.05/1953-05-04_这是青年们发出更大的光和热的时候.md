The "May Fourth" Youth Day is here. As we revisit the glorious history of the youth movement in our country since the "May Fourth" Movement, recalling the heroic struggles of patriotic youths against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and recalling their creative activities in protecting and building the motherland in various positions since the liberation of our country, we feel infinite glory. Under the deep concern and education of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, and through practical training in revolutionary struggle and construction work, the young generation of our country has continuously improved itself ideologically, politically, and professionally, becoming more mature and stronger year by year. In the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, various social reform movements, labor emulation drives, mutual aid and cooperation movements, and cultural and political learning movements, many young people have demonstrated the excellent qualities of being brave in battle, good at labor, and diligent in learning, winning the support of the broad masses and becoming the backbone of the movements. From their ranks, many brilliant heroes and models have emerged, whose exemplary deeds and creative labor have played a huge role in the revolutionary cause of changing the face of the people's lives and spirits.

Today, our motherland has entered a new period of construction, and the glorious task, which is both great and arduous, lies before the people of the whole country. This requires the youth of the whole country to radiate greater light and heat, and under the banner of patriotism, advance more courageously on the road of construction. Our love for the motherland is not an empty and abstract love, but a real love with very rich content. Love the beautiful mountains and rivers and the endless treasures of the motherland, love the excellent revolutionary traditions and the glorious reality of New Democracy, love the brave, hardworking, and intelligent people of the motherland, love Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, and love the socialist and communist future. Since the "May Fourth" Movement, the people of our country, under the banner of patriotism and united around the Chinese Communist Party, have fought long and arduous battles against reactionary ruling forces at home and abroad, advancing wave upon wave, unyielding and indomitable, and finally seized the motherland from the hands of the enemy, transforming it into the people's own country. This revolutionary patriotism is the spiritual condition that allows us to have invincible power and overcome powerful enemies at home and abroad. The historic victory of the Chinese people's revolution has further enriched the specific content of our patriotism and greatly enhanced its fighting power. Driven by this force, we have completely destroyed the foundations of the old society, consolidated the people's democratic power, and paved the way for national construction in just a few years, and we will march towards the goal of socialism on this road. Every youth in New China should, with such awareness and confidence, throw himself into the upsurge of national construction like a dragon or tiger.

For the sake of construction, young people must study tenaciously, studying in schools, in government offices, and in various positions in factories and rural areas. Comrade Stalin said at the Eighth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union in 1928: "We have countless people who are willing to participate in construction and lead construction in agriculture and industry. But we have far too few people who are good at construction and leadership..."

　　“To build, you must have knowledge, you must master science. And to have knowledge, you must study. Study tenaciously and patiently...

　　We have a fortress in front of us. This fortress is called science, and it has many departments of knowledge. We must take this fortress no matter what. The youth should take it down if they want to become builders of a new life, if they want to become true replacements for the old guard." The working people of our country have long been under the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudal forces, and in the environment of revolutionary struggle, they have not had the opportunity to learn science and technology, which has increased their difficulty in learning science and technology today. However, on the other hand, due to the improvement of their material life and the increase of their political consciousness, labor enthusiasm, and learning requirements since liberation, and due to the planned cultivation of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they have begun to attack the fortress of science on the basis of the cultural learning movement. In our youth ranks, many people have the determination and confidence to capture this fortress, and are attacking it stubbornly and unyieldingly, and have already achieved many victories. The diligent efforts and outstanding achievements of Soviet youth in learning science and technology have given them unlimited encouragement. On the cultural front in the Soviet Union, were not many young workers and young collective farm members awarded the glorious Stalin Prize along with outstanding scholars? New China must accelerate the cultivation of its own strong expert team. This is an indispensable team for building our great motherland. The youth of New China must fully recognize their particularly important responsibilities.

The experts required by New China must not only have sufficient scientific knowledge, but also have noble political qualities, a deep understanding of the development direction of New China and the serious significance of current construction, be lively and cheerful, brave and firm, selfless, and become loyal sons of the motherland and the people, and ardent revolutionary patriots. In this regard, the Soviet Union has once again given us a brilliant example. Chinese youth should learn from the Soviet Union not only to unswervingly learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, learn from the Soviet Union's science and technology and advanced production experience, but also to learn from the noble qualities of Soviet youth - the qualities of the Korchagin type, the Matrosov type, the Oleg type, and the Zoya and Shura type. These figures are familiar and loved by the vast number of young people in our country. The qualities of these people are the typical qualities of Soviet youth and are our best examples to learn from. In these qualities, patriotism is combined with internationalism, great ideals and long-term goals are combined with the spirit of being down-to-earth and seeking truth from facts, and under the condition that personal interests are subordinate to collective interests, there is no contradiction between personal prospects and the future of the people, no contradiction between personal interests and the needs of the people, and no contradiction between thought and action. Their entire lives are burned for the benefit of the motherland and the people, which is called serving the people wholeheartedly. People with such qualities will do whatever the people need them to do; they will learn whatever they do, and they must learn well, no matter how difficult it is.

To cultivate this noble new quality is by no means an easy task. It must be carried out through strict ideological training, political training, and work training, and must be stubbornly fought against the actual difficulties in all aspects. Among the youth of our country, there are still remnants of thoughts and feelings left over from the old society, especially the remnants of individualistic thoughts and feelings. This is a stumbling block preventing them from leaping forward. This situation requires them to study Marxism-Leninism tirelessly, deeply understand the importance of linking theory with practice, not only not to be afraid of difficulties in daily life, daily work, and daily study, but also to bravely meet difficulties, to train their revolutionary qualities in the process of constantly overcoming difficulties, and to constantly check their own thoughts, feelings, and actions according to the above-mentioned noble qualities of Soviet youth, and to use the fire of this quality to burn down the roots of any individualistic thoughts and feelings, to ignite a high degree of political enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility to the country and the people, to make you go forward bravely, fearlessly, exert endless power, break through any difficulties, capture any fortresses of culture, science and technology, and wholeheartedly serve the construction cause of the country.

The speed of construction of New China is inseparable from the speed of growth of the young generation in all aspects. Without enough qualified young cadres, without a large number of energetic, vigorous, and infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause of the motherland and the people, it is impossible to smoothly complete the construction task of the great motherland. Comrade Stalin said at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers in 1933: "Comrades, the youth are our future, our hope. The youth should replace us old men in the future. The youth should hold our banner to the final victory." Our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party, and the people of the whole country also have unlimited care and expectations for the Chinese youth. We believe that they will surely carry forward the glorious tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, radiate greater light and heat, and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely strive for the complete victory of the great construction cause of the motherland.

    这是青年们发出更大的光和热的时候
    “五四”青年节到来了。我们重温“五四”以来我国青年运动的光辉历史，回想爱国青年们反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义的英勇斗争，回想我国解放以来他们在各种岗位上保卫和建设祖国的创造性活动，我们感到无限的光荣。在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的深切关怀和教养之下，在革命斗争和建设工作的实际锻炼中，我国年青的一代，不断地从思想上、政治上和业务上提高自己，一年比一年成熟，一年比一年坚强。在伟大的抗美援朝运动、各种社会改革运动、劳动竞赛运动、互助合作运动和文化学习、政治学习运动中，很多青年表现了勇于战斗、善于劳动、勤于学习的优良品质，为广大人民所拥护，成为运动中的骨干分子。从他们的队伍中，涌现了许多光辉的英雄模范，他们的模范事迹和创造性劳动，在改变人民的生活面貌和精神面貌的革命事业中发挥了巨大的作用。
    今天，我们的祖国进入了新的建设时期，摆在全国人民面前的是十分伟大而又十分艰巨的光荣任务。这就要求全国青年发出更大的光和热，在爱国主义的大旗下，更勇猛地在建设道路上前进。我们对于祖国的爱，不是空洞抽象的爱，而是有非常丰富内容的真实的爱。爱祖国的秀美山河和无尽宝藏，爱祖国的优良革命传统和新民主主义的光辉现实，爱祖国的勇敢、勤劳和聪明的人民，爱毛主席、共产党和人民政府，爱社会主义、共产主义的远景。“五四”以来，我国人民就是在爱国主义的旗帜下，团结在中国共产党的周围，前仆后继、不屈不挠，向国内外反动统治势力进行了长期艰苦的斗争，而终于把祖国从敌人手里夺取过来，使之变为人民自己的国家。这种革命的爱国主义，就是我们所以具有无敌的力量，能够战胜强大的国内外敌人的精神条件。而我国人民革命的历史性胜利，更加丰富了我们的爱国主义的具体内容，益发增强了它的战斗力量。在这种力量的推动下，我们在短短的几年中彻底摧毁了旧社会的基础，巩固了人民民主政权，铺平了国家建设的道路，我们要在这条道路上向社会主义的目标进军。新中国的每个青年都应该带着这样的自觉和自信，生龙活虎似地投入国家建设的热潮。
    为了建设，青年们就要顽强地学习，在学校里学习，在机关里学习，在工厂、农村里各种岗位上学习。斯大林同志在一九二八年苏联列宁共产主义青年团第八次代表大会上说：“无论在农业方面和工业方面，我们愿意参加建设和领导建设的人真是数也数不尽的。而我们善于建设和领导的人却少得太不像样……。”
      “要建设，就必须有知识，就必须掌握科学。而要有知识，就必须学习。顽强地、耐心地学习……。
    我们面前有一个堡垒。这个堡垒叫作科学，它有许许多多知识部门。这个堡垒我们不管怎样要把它拿下来。青年应当把它拿下来，如果他们愿意成为新生活底建设者的话，如果他们愿意成为老警卫军底真正替换者的话。”我国劳动人民曾经长期处在帝国主义和封建势力的压迫和剥削之下，处在革命斗争的环境中，没有学习科学技术的机会，这就增加了他们今天学习科学技术的困难。然而在另一方面，由于解放以来他们物质生活的改善和政治觉悟、劳动积极性和学习要求的提高，由于共产党和人民政府的有计划的培养，他们在文化学习运动的基础上，已经开始向科学堡垒进攻了。在我们的青年队伍中，许多人都有决心、有信心攻下这座堡垒，而且正在顽强不屈地进攻着它，已经取得了不少的战果。苏联青年学习科学技术的刻苦努力和卓越成就，更给他们无限的鼓励。在苏联的文化战线上，许多青年工人和青年集体农庄庄员，不是与卓越的学者们一起获得光荣的斯大林奖金吗？新中国一定要加速度地培养出自己的强大专家队伍。这是建设我们伟大祖国的不可缺少的队伍。新中国的青年必须充分认识自己特别重大的责任。
    新中国所要求的专家，不但要具有足够的科学知识，而且要具有高尚的政治品质，深刻理解新中国的发展方向和当前建设的严重意义，活泼愉快，勇敢坚定，大公无私，成为祖国和人民的忠诚儿子，热烈的革命爱国主义者。在这一方面，苏联又给了我们光辉的榜样。中国青年学习苏联，不但要坚定不移地学习苏联的建设经验，学习苏联的科学技术和先进生产经验，而且要学习苏联青年的高尚品质——柯察金型、马特洛索夫型、奥列格型、卓娅与舒拉型的品质。这些人物是我国广大青年所熟悉、所热爱的。这些人的品质就是苏维埃青年的典型品质，是我们最好的学习榜样。在这种品质里，爱国主义与国际主义相结合，伟大理想、远大目标与脚踏实地、实事求是的精神相结合，在个人利益服从于集体利益的条件下，没有个人出路与人民前途的矛盾，没有个人兴趣与人民需要的矛盾，没有思想与行动的矛盾。他们的全部生命都为祖国和人民的利益而燃烧，这才叫做全心全意为人民服务。有这样品质的人，人民需要他做什么，便做什么；做什么，便学什么，而且一定要学好，不管有多大困难。
    要养成这种崇高的新品质，决不是轻而易举的事，必须通过严格的思想锻炼、政治锻炼和工作锻炼，必须与各方面的实际困难进行顽强的搏斗。在我国青年中，还有着旧社会遗留下来的思想感情的残余，特别是个人主义的思想感情的残余。这是阻碍他们飞跃前进的绊脚石。这种情况要求他们孜孜不倦地学习马克思列宁主义，深刻理解理论联系实际的重要性，在日常生活、日常工作和日常学习中不但不畏避困难，而且勇敢地迎接困难，在不断克服困难的过程中锻炼自己的革命品质，并经常根据上述的苏联青年的高尚品质来检查自己的思想、感情和行动，用这种品质的烈火来烧毁任何个人主义思想感情的根株，燃起高度的政治热情和对国家、对人民的责任感，使你勇往直前，无所畏惧，发挥出无穷无尽的力量，突破任何难关，攻下任何文化、科学和技术的堡垒，忠心耿耿地为国家的建设事业服务。
    新中国的建设速度，是跟年青一代在各方面的成长速度分不开的。没有足够合格的青年干部，没有大量精神抖擞、生气勃勃、对祖国人民革命事业有无限忠诚的建设专才，就不可能顺利完成伟大祖国的建设任务。斯大林同志一九三三年在第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上说：“同志们，青年是我们的将来，是我们的希望。青年将来应当替换我们这些老头子。青年将来应当把我们的旗帜撑持到最终的胜利。”我们的伟大领袖毛泽东同志、我们的党以及全国人民对中国青年的关怀和瞩望，也是无限量的。我们相信他们一定能够发扬“五四”的光荣传统，发出更大的光和热，跟全国人民一起，坚决为祖国的伟大建设事业的彻底胜利而奋斗。
