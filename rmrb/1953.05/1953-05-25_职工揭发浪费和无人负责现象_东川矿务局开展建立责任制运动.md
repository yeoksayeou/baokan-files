Staff Expose Waste and Lack of Accountability
Dongchuan Mining Bureau Launches Responsibility System Campaign

Yunnan's Dongchuan Mining Bureau's staff and masses have exposed serious waste and a lack of accountability in the bureau's capital construction this year, prompting the bureau to quickly launch a campaign against waste, against lack of accountability, and to establish a responsibility system.

Employees of the Dongchuan Mining Bureau's Engineering Company revealed that the company's blind construction this year without design, construction plans, or material budgets has resulted in serious waste. Of the twenty-one projects started by the company's Second Engineering Team in the first quarter, none had construction plans or material budgets (only nine had construction drawings). As a result, the quality of the projects was extremely poor, or the construction period was delayed due to work stoppages waiting for materials. For example, the ten carpentry workshops in Damadi were started without even a design sketch, based solely on a leader's words. As a result, the stonemasons built the foundations as high as the ground, the carpenters made the frame spans very small, and the roof was made high and long. The pillars that were originally intended to be buried in the ground were also shortened, leaving the frame standing on the footings, so that two-thirds of it was blown down by the wind. When construction of the technical school project began, the team discovered that there were no frames or iron parts, and temporarily sent people to Kunming to buy them, delaying the construction period by half a month. The company installed an 80-kilowatt diesel generator, which should have taken only six days, but it took thirty-five days to complete because of waiting for concrete foundations, electrical materials, meters, fuses, insulation boards, screws, etc.

The bureau only focused on progress, disregarding quality and cost, resulting in waste and substandard results. The specifications for the tunnels were originally two meters high and two meters wide, but in many places they were only 1.6 meters high and not wide enough at two meters. Some were so narrow that even two workers could not work in them at the same time. The tunnel heading should have been dug north, but it was dug south. Some were dug a few meters in the wrong direction before the direction was corrected. The same situation occurred in drilling projects. In the Luobodi No. 1 drilling site of the Luoxue Mine, the engineering team used core barrels to replace diamond drills after the diamond drills were used up. As a result, no cores were taken. In March, no cores were taken for eight days, and the general core recovery rate was only 13%, and most of them were rock powder or gravel. Because the leadership never inquired about the material consumption of tunneling, the cost of drilling often exceeded the plan: the cost of mechanically excavated tunnels exceeded the plan by 80% per meter of tunnel, and the cost of manually excavated tunnels exceeded the plan by 23%. Many equipment and materials were transported from Kunming by truck, but the bureau did not stipulate the daily mileage of the trucks. Some round trips took three days, some took seven days, and some took fifteen days. Due to the lack of inspection, repair, and protection systems for the trucks, the utilization rate of the trucks participating in transportation was only 55%.

The bureau blindly applied for allocation and procurement of materials, resulting in a large amount of capital backlog. The bureau's current ordered and stocked timber exceeds the actual needs by 63%, steel pipes by more than six times, white iron pipes by more than four times, and the tools, just files alone, are enough for forty years. A 180-horsepower pump from Shanghai that pumps 2,500 gallons of water per minute was idled because it was too large and not suitable.

Equipment is lost or damaged in large quantities due to lack of management. The Gumin Mine material warehouse has 1,034 sleepers, which are unusable due to prolonged backlog and decay. People only know that there are 100 tons of cement scattered in various places, but no one knows exactly where. The Engineering Company puts hardware, gasoline, wood, and explosives together, and no one corrects it.

The main reason for the serious waste and lack of accountability is the serious bureaucratism of leaders at all levels of the bureau. For example, the Finance Department does not know the usage of funds allocated to each unit; the Personnel Department does not know how many people are in each unit; the Supply Department does not know the equipment ordering and inventory situation; the Engineering Company only knows the situation of the Second Engineering Team, but does not know the situation of other engineering teams. Many liability accidents were not seriously dealt with.

The exposure of the above phenomena has urged the bureau's leading cadres to recognize the seriousness of the problem. According to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, they have launched a mass campaign against waste, against lack of accountability, and to establish a responsibility system.

    职工揭发浪费和无人负责现象
    东川矿务局开展建立责任制运动
    云南东川矿务局职工群众揭发了该局今年基本建设中的严重浪费和无人负责现象，促使该局迅速开展了反浪费、反无人负责与建立责任制运动。
    东川矿务局工程公司职工揭发了该公司今年因为没有设计、施工计划和工料预算就盲目施工所造成的严重浪费。该公司第二工程队在第一季度开工的二十一件工程，都没有施工计划和工料预算（有施工图的也只有九件），结果工程质量极坏，或因停工待料而拖延了工期。如大麦地十间木工工作间，连设计草图还没有，只凭领导干部的一句话，就动手盖了起来，结果石工把基础砌得和地面一样高，木工把房架的跨度做得很小，把屋面做得又高又长，把原来准备埋在土里的柱子也锯短了，使房架凭空立在基脚上，以致一刮风就被吹倒三分之二。在技工学校工程开工时，该队才发现没有房架和铁件，临时派人去昆明买，使工期拖后半个月。该公司安装一台八十瓩的柴油发电机，本来只要六天就够了，但因等待打混凝土基础，等电料、电表、保险丝、绝缘板、螺丝等，共花了三十五天才完工。
    该局只赶进度，不顾质量，不计成本，造成浪费和不合规格的结果。坑道的规格原为两公尺高、两公尺宽，但有许多地方只有一点六公尺高，宽也不够两公尺，有的狭小到连两个工人同时工作都挤不开。坑头方向该向北打，但向南打了，有的打错了几公尺后才改正方向。在钻探工程中，也有同样情形。工程队在落雪矿萝卜地一号钻场用完了金钢石钻，就以岩芯管来代替，结果岩芯取不上，三月份就有八天没有取出一点岩芯，一般的岩芯采取率也只有百分之十三，并且大都是岩粉或碎粒。由于领导方面从不过问掘坑的材料消耗，打眼的成本常常超过计划：以每公尺坑道为单位，机械掘的坑道的成本超过百分之八十，手工掘的坑道的成本超过百分之二十三。许多设备、材料都是用汽车从昆明运来的，但该局对汽车每日行车里程却没有规定，有的往返一次要三天，有的要七天，有的则要十五天。由于没有检查、修理和保护汽车的制度，参加运输的汽车的运用率只达百分之五十五。
    该局盲目申请调拨和采购材料，造成大量的资金积压。该局现已订到的和库存的木材数量超过实际需要的百分之六十三，钢管超过六倍多，白铁管超过四倍多，工具方面单是锉刀一项就够用四十年。从上海调来一台一百八十匹马力、每分钟抽水二千五百加仑的水泵，因太大不适用而被闲置着。
    器材因无人管理，大批遗失或损坏。固民矿材料仓库中有枕木一千零三十四根，因积压过久已腐朽不能用。人们只知道有一百吨水泥分散在各地，但没有人知道究竟在什么地方。工程公司把五金器材、汽油、木材和炸药放在一起，也没有人纠正。
    造成严重的浪费和无人负责的主要原因，是该局各级领导干部都有严重的官僚主义。如财务处不知道各单位拨款的使用情况；人事处不知道各单位有多少人；供应处不知道器材订货情况和库存情况；工程公司只知道第二工程队的情况，而不知道其他工程队的情况，许多责任事故都没有人认真处理。
    以上现象的揭发，督促该局领导干部认识到问题的严重性。他们已根据中央重工业部的指示，发动群众开展反浪费、反无人负责与建立责任制运动。
