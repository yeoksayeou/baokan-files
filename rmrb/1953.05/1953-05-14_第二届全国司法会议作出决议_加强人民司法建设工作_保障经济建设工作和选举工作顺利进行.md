    The Second National Judicial Conference convened by the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council was held in Beijing from April 11th to 25th. This conference was convened after the judicial reform movement across the country achieved significant results. Attending the conference were 212 principal cadres from the political and legal committees and judicial departments of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities across the country. The central task of the conference was to summarize the experiences of the judicial reform movement and discuss the main tasks of judicial organs and their own construction and improvement in the future.

    At the opening of the conference, Dong Biwu, Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, gave important instructions. He emphasized that the people's judicial organs are one of the important weapons for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. People's judicial workers must stand firmly on the people's stand, earnestly implement the country's laws and decrees, and wholeheartedly grasp this weapon for the country and the people. At the same time, they should also adopt the most convenient working methods possible to solve the problems that the people demand to be solved. He also pointed out that the achievements of judicial work over the past three years are the main thing, especially the judicial reform movement has achieved great results. However, there are still serious problems in the current judicial work, a large number of backlog cases have not been completely resolved, and it has been found that there are a number of cases that were handled improperly or not very properly in the past, and these problems should continue to be resolved with a serious attitude in the future. Finally, he emphasized that large-scale economic construction work has already begun, and judicial work is even more arduous. In the future, judicial construction work should be strengthened on the basis of judicial reform to ensure the completion of national economic construction.

    Shi Liang, Minister of the Central Ministry of Justice, made a report at the conference on "Strengthening the Construction of People's Judicial Work". After summarizing the achievements and experiences of the judicial reform movement, she made a detailed report on specific judicial construction issues such as the establishment of circuit courts, specialized courts in industrial and mining areas, people's reception rooms, and mediation committees.

    Zhang Zhizhiang, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, in his report on "Consolidating the Achievements of Judicial Reform and Improving Court Work," talked about several tasks that the Supreme People's Court plans to carry out this year. He said that the Supreme People's Court will focus on summarizing the judgment experience of courts at all levels, circulate precedents, select typical counties and cities to investigate and study court trial work, and provide timely and specific guidance to lower levels.

    The conference also listened to Xu Deheng, Acting Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission, explain the draft "Trial Implementation Rules of Litigation Procedure" and the draft "Prison Regulations," and Wei Wenbo, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Justice, explain the draft "Provisional Organization Regulations of Mediation Committees."

    After detailed discussion on various tasks at the conference, representatives of major administrative regions successively spoke at the conference, unanimously agreeing with the spirit of several reports at the conference, believing that these reports clearly pointed out the guidelines, tasks, and path of people's judicial work and judicial construction. With the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, they criticized the bureaucratic style of the central judicial organs in leading the work of lower-level judicial organs in the past, and also reviewed their shortcomings in implementing the instructions of the central party and government leading organs, and proposed how to implement the resolutions of this conference. Subsequently, representatives of major administrative regions introduced typical experiences related to model courts, model judges, mediation committees, court work in industrial and mining areas, and the implementation of the jury system, and exchanged experiences. Peng Zhen, Vice Director of the Political and Legal Committee, made a summary of the conference. Finally, the Second National Judicial Conference unanimously adopted the resolution.

    The conference unanimously agreed that for more than three years, people's courts and people's tribunals at all levels across the country, under difficult conditions such as incomplete organization and insufficient cadre strength, have handled more than 6 million cases. From the judicial work, they have guaranteed the smooth progress of land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and maintained the order of the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's democratic rights. In the above-mentioned movements, especially in the judicial reform movement, organizational rectification and ideological transformation were carried out, and the remaining old legal views and old judicial styles were effectively attacked. The principled boundaries between new and old laws were basically drawn in the minds of cadres, a large number of backlog cases were cleared with the help of the masses, and some cases that were improperly handled in the past were checked and reprocessed. The connection between the people's courts and the masses has been strengthened, laying the foundation for further construction of people's judicial work in the future, which is a great achievement. While affirming the achievements of judicial work in the past three years, the conference pointed out that there are still some serious errors and shortcomings in judicial work in the past three years. Not only are the organizational structure and working system still very unsound, and there is still serious bureaucracy and carelessness in the leadership at all levels, but also because in the past, they have been busy cooperating with one major movement after another, the number of cases received has always far exceeded the subjective ability to bear. Especially before the judicial reform, there were extremely serious impure phenomena in the organization and style of the courts. Some links in some courts were even controlled by bad elements, so there are still many backlog cases that have not been processed and some cases that have been improperly processed. These errors and shortcomings must be completely overcome in the future.

    The conference analyzed the current situation and determined that the central task of judicial work in the future should be to continue to carry out resolute struggles against the enemy's sabotage and other acts that violate national laws and harm the interests of the people, so as to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. It should be to safeguard the smooth progress of the country's economic construction work and the election work of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels from the judicial aspect. It should be to actively clear and gradually reduce the backlog of cases, and conscientiously check and deal with some improperly handled cases in the past period. The conference also believes that systematic judicial construction work should be carried out simultaneously in the process of these works. The conference stipulated specific methods for county and city people's courts to dispatch people's tribunals specializing in handling election litigation cases to ensure the general election work. It stipulated that specialized courts should be established in industrial and mining areas and along railways and waterways in a focused and step-by-step manner. The conference specifically and thoroughly analyzed the handling of past cases, stipulated methods for inspection and specific handling, and continued to firmly grasp the clearing of backlog cases. After summarizing and exchanging the experiences of people's courts and people's tribunals in various places over the past three years, the conference determined to carry out people's mediation work under leadership, gradually establish circuit courts universally at the county level, establish a jury system in the first instance, and establish and strengthen people's reception rooms and duty trial work in courts at all levels, and other new measures. In order to change the situation of insufficient judicial cadres, the conference formulated methods for supplementing, cultivating, and training cadres, and decided to strengthen judicial administrative organs at all levels to be responsible for the management and education of judicial cadres. In order to overcome the phenomenon of weak ideological and political leadership in the current judicial system, the conference believes that judicial leading organs at all levels must firmly grasp the leadership of cadres' theoretical, policy, and business studies; they must seize typical examples, conscientiously summarize and exchange work experience; they should always pay attention to studying and promoting the advanced experience of Soviet judicial work; strengthen investigation and research, discover problems in time, and give guidance to lower levels.

    The various decisions of the conference, Director Dong Biwu's report, Vice Director Peng Zhen's summary, and Minister Shi Liang and Vice President Zhang Zhizhiang's reports were warmly supported by the participants. They unanimously believed that this conference solved some ideological problems existing in the current judicial work, and also solved the current specific work problems, which is of extremely important significance in the history of judicial construction.

    第二届全国司法会议作出决议
    加强人民司法建设工作
    保障经济建设工作和选举工作顺利进行
    【新华社十日讯】政务院政治法律委员会召开的第二届全国司法会议，从四月十一日到二十五日在北京举行。这次会议是在全国各地司法改革运动获得重大成果后召开的。出席会议的有全国各大行政区、省、市政治法律委员会及司法部门主要干部二百十二人。会议中心任务为总结司法改革运动的经验和讨论今后司法机关的主要工作和本身的建设和健全问题。
    会议开幕时，政务院政治法律委员会董必武主任对会议作了重要指示。他着重指出：人民司法机关是巩固人民民主专政的重要武器之一，人民司法工作者必须站稳人民的立场，严肃地贯彻国家的法令，全心全意为国家、为人民掌握好这个武器；同时还要尽可能采取最便利人民的工作方法，解决人民要求解决的问题。他并指出：三年来的司法工作成绩是主要的，特别是司法改革运动获得了很大成绩。但当前司法工作还存有严重问题，大量积案尚未彻底解决，并且检查出过去有一批处理得不妥当或不很妥当的案件，今后应继续以严肃态度去解决这些问题。最后他强调指出：目前大规模的经济建设工作已经开始，司法工作更加繁重，今后应在司法改革的基础上，加强司法建设工作，以保障国家经济建设的完成。
    中央司法部史良部长在会议上作了“关于加强人民司法工作建设”的报告。她在总结了司法改革运动的成绩和经验之后，对建立巡回法庭、工矿区等专门法庭、人民接待室和调解委员会等具体的司法工作建设问题，作了详细的报告。
    最高人民法院张志让副院长在“关于巩固司法改革的成果改进法院工作”的报告中，谈到了最高人民法院在本年度拟进行的几项工作，他说：最高人民法院将有重点地总结各级法院的判决经验，通报判例，选择典型县、市调查研究法院审判工作，及时给下级以具体指导。
    会议还听取了法制委员会许德珩代理主任委员关于“诉讼程序试行通则”草案、“监狱条例”草案和中央司法部魏文伯副部长关于“调解委员会暂行组织条例”草案的说明。
    会议对各项工作经过详尽讨论后，各大行政区代表相继在大会上发言，一致同意会议中几个报告的精神，认为这些报告明确地指出了人民司法工作的方针、任务与司法建设的道路，并以批评与自我批评的精神，批评了中央司法机关过去在领导下级司法机关工作中的官僚主义作风，也检讨了自己在贯彻中央党政领导机关指示方面的缺点，并提出了如何贯彻此次会议决议的办法。接着，各大行政区代表作了有关模范法院、模范审判员、调解委员会、工矿区的法院工作和实行陪审制度等典型经验的介绍，交流了经验。会议由政治法律委员会彭真副主任作了总结。最后全体一致通过了第二届全国司法会议的决议。
    会议一致认为：三年多来，全国各级人民法院和人民法庭，在机构不健全、干部力量不足等困难条件下，共处理了六百余万件案件，从司法工作方面保障了土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”等各项运动的顺利进行，维护了人民民主专政的秩序和人民的民主权利；并在上述各项运动中，特别是在司法改革运动中，进行了组织的整顿和思想的改造，对残存的旧法观点和旧司法作风，给了有效的打击，在干部思想中基本上划清了新旧法律的原则界限，依靠群众的帮助清理了大批积案，检查和重新处理了一些过去处理不妥的案件；密切了人民法院与群众的联系，为今后人民司法工作的进一步的建设打下了基础，是有很大成绩的。会议在肯定三年来司法工作成绩的同时，并指出：三年来在司法工作中，也还存在着一些严重的错误和缺点，不仅组织机构和工作制度还很不健全，各级领导上还存在着严重的官僚主义和粗枝大叶的作风，而且因为过去一直忙于配合一个接一个的大运动，所收案件总是远超过主观的负担能力，特别是在司法改革前，法院组织和作风方面还存在着极为严重的不纯现象，有些法院的若干环节并曾为坏分子所把持，因而还有许多积案没有处理并有些处理不妥的案件。这些错误和缺点，今后必须彻底克服。
    会议分析了目前情况，确定今后司法工作的中心任务，应该是和敌人的暗害破坏行为及其他一切违犯国家法令和危害人民群众利益的行为继续进行坚决的斗争，以进一步巩固人民民主专政；应该是从司法方面保障国家经济建设工作和全国及地方各级人民代表大会选举工作的顺利进行；应该是积极清理和逐步减少积压的案件，认真检查和处理过去一个时期的若干处理不妥的案件。会议并认为应在上述这些工作过程中，同时进行系统的司法建设工作。会议规定了县、市人民法院派出专门处理有关选举诉讼案件的人民法庭，以保障普选工作的具体办法；规定了在工矿区和铁路、水运沿线方面有重点有步骤地建立专门法庭。会议具体详尽地分析了过去案件处理的情况，规定了检查和具体处理的办法，并继续抓紧清理积案。会议在总结和交流了三年来各地人民法院和人民法庭的经验后，确定了有领导地开展民间调解工作，在县级逐步普遍地建立巡回法庭，在一审中建立陪审制，各级法院要建立与加强人民接待室和值日审判工作等各项新的措施。为了改变司法干部不足的情况，会议订出了补充和培养、训练干部的办法，并决定加强各级司法行政机构，以负责司法干部的管理和教育工作。为了克服目前司法系统中思想政治领导薄弱的现象，会议认为：各级司法领导机关必须抓紧干部理论、政策和业务学习的领导；必须抓住典型，认真总结和交流工作经验；经常注意学习和推广苏联司法工作的先进经验；加强调查研究，及时发现问题，给下级以指导。
    会议的各项决定，董必武主任的报告，彭真副主任的总结，史良部长和张志让副院长的报告，得到到会人员的热烈拥护。他们一致认为，这次会议解决了当前司法工作方面存在的一些思想问题，也解决了当前的具体工作问题，在司法建设的历史上有极重要的意义。
