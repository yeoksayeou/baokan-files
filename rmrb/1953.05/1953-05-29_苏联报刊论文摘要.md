The Educational Work of Trade Union Groups
"Labor News" published an editorial on May 14th discussing how trade union groups should educate workers. The following is an abstract:

In its educational activities, the trade union must rely on numerous activists, first and foremost, the millions of trade union group leaders. Trade union group leaders are closest to the masses; they work shoulder to shoulder with them, understand their needs and thoughts, and know their attitude towards labor. Everyone knows that trade union groups unite workers in a work team, at a lathe, on a power unit, and in a section, and it is here that the fate of the production plan is decided. It is also here, in practice, that people's consciousness, their concern for national interests, their discipline, and their attitude of ownership towards people's property are manifested. Therefore, the trade union group, as the most basic link in the trade union organization, is able to more fully influence everyone and cultivate and educate them.

The work of the trade union is work with people. This is the essence of trade union work. Some of the best trade union group leaders correctly understand that their main task is to help everyone discover their talents, elevate them to the ranks of Stakhanovite workers and production innovators, attract them to participate in social activities, and educate those who do not value collective interests and work carelessly and lazily.

The powerful force that shapes and perfects the fine qualities of Soviet people is, first and foremost, socialist competition.

The greatest advantage of socialist competition lies in the fact that it fundamentally changes people's views on labor, develops and strengthens comradely mutual assistance, and strengthens their uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings and everything that hinders production achievements. Therefore, the entire work of organizing competitions in groups or sections should not be reduced to merely mechanically calculating output, but it must constantly observe the participants in the competition, care about their successes and failures, promptly help those who are lagging behind, and criticize those who are negligent in their duties.

The publicity of positive examples, excellent work models, and creative initiatives is of great educational significance. In every section, in every large or small collective, there are such examples. The task of the trade union group leader is to fully support positive examples, introduce them to all producers, and help bring those who are lagging behind to the level of the advanced.

At the same time, it is also important to use public influence. In our production work, there are still phenomena of violating discipline, poor work, and seeking personal gain. Every violation of labor discipline and technical operating procedures should be submitted to group discussion; this will establish an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings and will force those who are lagging behind to keep pace with the collective.

In carrying out educational work, trade unions should not use rigid formulas. Trade union groups are composed of people of different ages, different professional levels, and different knowledge. They must be treated individually and must be good at using various methods such as encouragement, help, and condemnation to educate them.

The experience of advanced activists proves that it is very important to carry out mass political and cultural education work in each trade union group. It is necessary to explain to the members of the group the events of domestic and foreign life, let them know the achievements of our national economy, introduce them to reading materials, and attract workers to participate in night schools and technical research groups.

However, it would be wrong to overestimate the strength of trade union group leaders, cultural and educational cadres, and other activists in the group. They need the constant help of the trade union workshop committee and factory committee. A rule must be established so that members of the workshop committee and factory committee regularly attend various trade union group meetings. The most experienced propagandists should be sent to the sections. The best producers, engineers, and staff from libraries, clubs, and medical institutions should be invited more frequently to hold seminars in the sections.

On Saving in Construction Projects
"The Whistle" published an article by Kondratyev on May 6th discussing the economical use of materials in construction projects. The following is an abstract:

One of the most important factors constituting construction costs is the use of materials.

In general, the various construction organizations in the railway transportation system are able to comply with the prescribed norms for the use of basic building materials. However, in individual organizations, there are still phenomena of waste.

Design agencies play a very important role in striving for the economical use of building materials. However, the fact is that they still frequently tolerate waste. For example, regardless of the established technical regulations, stone buildings are still being designed as concrete walls on the Kovel railway line. If such a design is implemented on the Kovel railway line, it will waste 144 tons of concrete.

There are many such wastes. For example, in the residential buildings of some railway systems in Moscow and Mytishchi, the concrete consumption of each cubic meter of reinforced concrete composite structure is still designed to be 413 kilograms instead of the standard quota of 230-290 kilograms. The Pechora Railway Bureau and the Northern Railway Bureau doubled the consumption of concrete; they designed almost all buildings as concrete or concrete rubble mixed foundations, although it is entirely possible to use local stone as a foundation.

These examples fully illustrate the need to strengthen the fight against waste in design work.

However, correct design alone is not enough. What is important is to be good at carrying out construction carefully according to the design. To help construction workers, the state has promulgated some technical regulations that provide many ways to save materials. However, some leaders of railway construction projects have violated these regulations. For example, in 1952, the three engineering units of the Building Construction Management Office consumed 73 tons more metal, 16 tons more nails, 1,154 cubic meters more wood, and 977 tons more concrete than the quota... The excessive consumption of metal is often caused by the load of the structure exceeding the weight prescribed by the drafters. In addition, a large amount of waste is often generated when cutting metal, which is also one of the reasons for the waste. The third section of the 19th construction project of the Building Construction Management Office consumed 20% more black rolled metal, and the reason lies here.

The Building Construction Management Office also has serious shortcomings in receiving and storing valuable materials. For example, the quality and quantity of materials are often not checked when they are delivered. There is also no guarantee of the integrity of valuable materials at the stacking site.

Some organizations do not register materials until two or three months after they arrive. They do not enter the payment of materials in a timely manner, and often do not account for them according to the actual consumption, but according to the quota. This creates the phenomenon that some materials are insufficient and other materials have a balance when clearing inventory.

The lack of a well-established quota system is also one of the reasons for the waste of materials in construction projects. When materials are issued to a foreman, because there is a lack of the actual quantity needed as determined by the production quota, the method of settling accounts afterwards is often adopted. As everyone knows, the material consumption quota system is not only a very important factor in saving materials, but also in improving the organization of all construction work.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    工会小组的教育工作
    “劳动报”五月十四日发表了论述各工会小组应如何教育工人的社论，摘要如下：
    工会在自己的教育活动方面，要依靠众多的积极分子，首先是依靠千百万工会小组长。工会小组长最深入群众，他和群众肩并肩地工作，懂得他们的需求和思想，了解他们对劳动的态度。大家知道，工会小组把在一个工作组、一个车床、一部联动机和一个工段中的工人团结在一起，而生产计划的命运正是在这些地方被决定。人们的自觉性、他们对国家利益的关怀、他们的纪律性和对人民财产的主人翁态度，也正是在这里，在实际中表现出来。所以，作为工会组织最基层环节的工会小组是能够更充分地来影响每个人，培养与教育他们的。
    工会的工作就是对人的工作。这正是工会工作的实质。一些最好的工会小组长都正确地了解，他们的主要任务就是帮助每个人去发现他的才能，使他提高到斯大哈诺夫式工作者和生产革新者的队伍中来，吸引他参加社会活动，并教育那些不重视集体利益和工作马虎懈怠的人。
    形成苏联人的优秀品质并使其趋于完美的强大力量，首先便是社会主义竞赛。
    社会主义竞赛的最大优点就在于，竞赛从根本上改变了人们对劳动的看法，发展和巩固同志间的互助，加强他们对缺点和对一切妨害生产成绩的事物的不妥协性。因此，不应把在小组或工段中组织竞赛的全部工作归结为仅是机械地计算产量，而是必须经常看到竞赛的参加者，关心他们的成功和失败，及时帮助落后的人，并批评那些玩忽职务的人。
    对积极的范例、优秀的工作榜样和创造性的倡议的宣传，具有非常重大的教育意义。在每个工段，每个大的或小的集体中都有这样的范例。工会小组长的任务就是要以全力支持积极的范例，把它们介绍给全体生产者，帮助把落后者提高到先进者的水平。
    同时，利用公共的影响力也是很重要的。在我们的生产工作中，还有破坏纪律、工作低劣和贪图私利的现象。每一次对劳动纪律和技术操作过程的破坏，都应当交由小组讨论；这样就会建立起对缺点的不妥协态度，就能强迫带动那些落后者，使他们同集体的步调看齐。
    工会在进行教育工作时，不应当使用刻板公式。工会小组是由不同年龄、不同业务水平和不同知识的人组成的。对他们必须采取个别对待的方法，并须善于利用各种方法如鼓励、帮助和谴责，来对他们进行教育。
    先进的积极分子的经验证明，在每个工会小组中，进行群众政治和文化教育工作，是很重要的。必须向小组中的成员说明国内外生活的事件，使他们知道我国国民经济的成就，为他们介绍读物，吸引工人参加夜校和技术研究小组。
    但是，如果过高估计工会小组长、文教干事和小组其他积极分子的力量，也是错误的。他们需要工会车间委员会和工厂委员会的经常帮助。必须确立一种规则，使车间委员会和工厂委员会的委员定期出席各个工会小组会议。应当派遣最有经验的鼓动员到各工段中去。应当更经常地邀请最优秀的生产者、工程师和图书馆、俱乐部和医药机关中的工作人员到各工段举行座谈会。
    论建设工程中的节约“汽笛报”五月六日发表了康德拉绍夫所著论述在 建设工程中节约地使用材料的文章，摘要如下：
    构成建筑费用的一个最重要的因素便是材料的使用。
    铁路运输系统中的各个建筑组织，一般说来，都能遵守已规定的对基本建筑材料的使用定额。但是在个别组织中仍有浪费的现象。
    在争取建筑材料的节约使用方面，设计机关具有非常重大的作用。但是，事实证明，直到现在它们仍经常容忍浪费。例如，不顾已经规定的技术规程，在科维尔铁路线上仍把石砌的建筑物设计成混凝土的墙壁。这样的设计如果在科维尔铁路线上付诸实施，那就会浪费一百四十四吨混凝土。
    这样的浪费是很多的。例如在莫斯科和梅梯什市的一些铁路系统的住宅建筑中，钢筋混凝土复合结构的每一立方公尺的混凝土消耗量仍设计为四一三公斤以代替标准定额二三○——二九○公斤。彼秋拉铁路局和北方铁路局使混凝土的消耗量增加了一倍，它们几乎把所有的建筑物都设计成混凝土或混凝土碎石混合基础，虽然用当地的石头做基础是完全可以的。
    这些例子充分说明了在设计工作中加强反浪费斗争的必要性。
    但是仅是正确的设计，还是不够的。重要的是在善于谨慎地按照设计进行施工。为了帮助建筑人员，国家曾颁布了一些技术规程，这些规程曾提供了许多节约材料的方法。然而，某些铁路建筑工程的领导者，却破坏了这些规程。例如，一九五二年楼房建筑管理处的三个工程单位便比定额多消耗了七十三吨金属、十六吨钉子、一一五四立方公尺的木材、九七七吨混凝土……。金属的过量消耗常是因结构的负荷量超过了制图人员所规定的重量而引起的。此外，在切割金属时，时常产生大量的废料，也是造成浪费的原因之一。楼房建筑管理处第十九号建筑工程的第三工段多消耗了百分之二十的黑色压延金属，其原因正是在这里。
    在领取和保管贵重材料方面，楼房建筑管理处也有严重的缺点。例如，在材料运到时，常不检查它的质量和数量。在堆货的工地上，也没有保证使贵重材料完整无缺。
    一些组织，在材料运抵两、三个月以后，才进行登记。它们对材料的付出不及时入账，而且常常不是按实际消耗量，而是按定额来记账。这就造成在清理库存时某种材料不足数而其他材料又有余额的现象。
    没有很好的建立定额制度，也是造成建筑工程中浪费材料的原因之一。当发材料给一个工长时，因为缺少依照生产定额所确定的实际需要数量，所以常是采用事后清账的办法。正如大家所周知，材料消耗定额制不仅在节约材料方面，而且在改进全部建筑工作的组织方面，也是一个非常重要的因素。
