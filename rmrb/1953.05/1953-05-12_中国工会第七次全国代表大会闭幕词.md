Comrades Delegates, Honored Guests, Comrades:

    The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions now victoriously concludes.

    Our congress, from the 2nd to today, has heard reports on trade union work, reports on the revision of the trade union charter, reports on trade union financial work, and reports on the industrial situation. After group and plenary discussions, the congress passed resolutions on the report on the work of the Chinese trade unions, on the revision of the Chinese trade union charter, and on the report on the financial work of the national trade unions. These reports and resolutions summarize the experiences of the national trade unions over the past four years and stipulate the guidelines and tasks of the national trade union work during the period of the planned economic construction of the state. The congress elected the new leading body of the national trade unions—the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions—demonstrating the unprecedented unity of the national working class. We believe that this Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese trade unions, maintain close ties with the broad masses of workers throughout the country, serve the broad masses of workers wholeheartedly, and correctly implement the resolutions of the congress, mobilizing and organizing the workers throughout the country to victoriously accomplish this new historical task: to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state's economic construction plans, and to struggle for the industrialization of the country and the gradual transition to a socialist society. This is the major achievement of our congress.

    The reason why our congress has been able to achieve such significant results is inseparable from the kind concern and instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. The national trade unions will further unite the broad masses of workers throughout the country around the great Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and under the great banner of Mao Zedong, advance from victory to victory.

    Our congress was convened with the attention and support of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country. We deeply feel that only in a people's democratic country led by the working class can the working class receive such attention from the state and occupy such a glorious and important position. At the same time, we are even more aware of the great responsibility for the cause of national construction. In the future, trade union organizations at all levels must further conduct patriotic education among the workers throughout the country, educate workers to abide by the state's policies and laws, and supervise the implementation of the state's policies and laws, fulfilling the responsibilities that trade unions should fulfill during the period of national construction, and playing the role of trade unions as a strong social pillar of the people's democratic regime.

    Our congress was honored to receive the congratulations of the Chinese People's Volunteers and representatives of farmers at the closing session, and to receive congratulatory telegrams from people from all walks of life across the country. These congratulations represent the hopes and encouragement of the people of the whole country for the Chinese working class, and demonstrate the strong unity of the workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life throughout the country. These congratulations have given us great encouragement and have increased our courage and confidence in completing the task of national construction a hundredfold. The workers throughout the country will forever maintain and consolidate this close alliance with the broad masses of peasant brothers, and will forever unite closely with the people of the whole country to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. This is an incomparably strong force to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the tasks during the period of national construction, and to consolidate and develop the victory of the Chinese people.

    What makes us particularly happy is that our congress has received the presence and congratulations of representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the presence and congratulations of representatives of trade unions from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and the congratulations of representatives of trade unions from many other countries and their telegrams. These congratulations express the celebration and support of the working class of the world for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people in carrying out great peaceful construction, and express the strong unity of the working class of the world for peace and for the struggle for peace. This congratulation and support from the working class of all countries in the world has further encouraged the belief of the Chinese working class in building its own country and defending world peace. In the future, the Chinese workers must carry forward the spirit of high internationalism consistent with patriotism, make unremitting efforts to strengthen the unity within the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the close unity between the Chinese and Soviet people, strengthen the unity with the working class of all countries in the world and all peace-loving people in the world, and strive to defend the unity of the world's labor movement, to defend the lasting peace of the Far East and the world.

    Our congress is a congress of unity, victory, and progress. Our task in the future is to implement the spirit and resolutions of this congress in all aspects of our work and transform them into the practical actions of millions of workers. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country and with the help and support of the working people of the world, the Chinese working class will certainly be able to victoriously complete and overfulfill the state's economic construction plans, and will certainly be able to victoriously complete the great historical task of national industrialization and the gradual transition to a socialist society. As this congress declares its victorious closing, we shout:

    Long live the Chinese working class!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the whole country!
    Long live the unity of the working class of the world!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the party of the Chinese working class!
    Long live the great Comrade Mao Zedong!

    中国工会第七次全国代表大会闭幕词
    刘长胜各位代表，各位来宾，各位同志：
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会，现在宣告胜利地闭幕了。
    我们的大会，从二日起到今天，听了工会工作的报告、修改工会章程的报告、工会财务工作的报告和关于工业情况的报告；经过分组与大会的讨论后，大会又通过了关于中国工会工作的报告、关于修改中国工会章程、关于全国工会财务工作的报告的决议。在这些报告和决议中，总结了四年来全国工会工作的经验，规定了国家有计划的经济建设时期的全国工会工作的方针和任务。大会选出了全国工会的新的领导机关——中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会，表现了全国工人阶级空前的团结。我们相信：这一届的中华全国总工会执行委员会，必将在中国共产党领导下，继承和发扬中国工会的优良传统，与全国工人群众保持密切的联系，全心全意地为全国工人群众服务，正确地贯彻执行大会的决议，动员和组织全国工人胜利地完成这一新的历史任务：保证完成和超额完成国家经济建设的计划，为国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。这是我们这次大会的重大成就。
    我们的大会，所以能够获得如此重大的成就，是与中国共产党中央和毛泽东同志对我们亲切的关怀与指示分不开的。全国工会必将进一步把全国广大工人群众，团结在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的周围，在伟大的毛泽东的旗帜下，从胜利走向胜利。
    我们的大会，是在中央人民政府和全国人民的关注与支持下召开的。我们深切地感到：只有在以工人阶级为领导的人民民主国家里，工人阶级才能受到国家这样的重视，才能处于这样光荣的重要地位。同时，我们也更加感到对于国家建设事业的重大责任。在今后，各级工会组织一定要进一步地向全国工人进行爱国主义的教育，教育工人遵守国家的政策法令，并监督国家政策法令的贯彻执行，尽到工会在国家建设时期应尽的责任，发挥工会作为人民民主政权的坚强的社会支柱的作用。
    我们的大会，荣幸地接受了中国人民志愿军和农民代表在闭幕会上的祝贺，接受了全国各界人民的来电祝贺。这些祝贺代表了全国人民对于中国工人阶级的希望与鼓励，表现了全国工人与农民和各界人民的坚强团结。这些祝贺，使我们感到了莫大的鼓舞，并百倍地增进了我们完成国家建设任务的勇气与信心。全国工人必将与广大的农民弟兄永远保持和巩固这种亲密的联盟，永远与全国人民亲密的团结一致，巩固人民民主专政，这是保证完成和超额完成国家建设时期的任务，巩固和发展中国人民胜利的无比坚强的力量。
    特别使我们感到高兴的是：我们的大会，得到了世界工会联合会的代表的光临和祝贺，得到了苏联工会和各人民民主国家工会代表的光临和祝贺，得到了其他许多国家工会代表及其来电的祝贺。这些祝贺中表示了全世界工人阶级对于中国工人阶级和中国人民进行伟大和平建设的庆贺与支持，表示了全世界工人阶级对于和平的热望与为和平而斗争的坚强团结。这种来自世界各国工人阶级的祝贺与支持，更加鼓舞了中国工人阶级为建设自己的祖国和保卫世界和平的信念。中国工人今后必将发扬高度的国际主义和爱国主义相一致的精神，努力不懈地加强以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营内部的团结，加强中苏两国人民的亲密团结，加强与世界各国工人阶级和世界一切爱好和平人民的团结，为保卫世界工人运动的统一、为保卫远东和世界的持久和平而斗争。
    我们的大会，是团结的、胜利的、前进的大会。我们今后的任务，就是要把这次大会的精神和决议，贯彻到各方面的工作中去，变为千百万工人群众的实际行动。我们相信：在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在全国人民的共同努力和全世界劳动人民的帮助与支持下，中国工人阶级一定能够胜利地完成和超额完成国家经济建设的计划，一定能够胜利地完成国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会的伟大历史任务。当此大会宣告胜利闭幕之时，我们高呼：
    中国工人阶级万岁！
    全国人民大团结万岁！
    全世界工人阶级团结万岁！
    中国工人阶级自己的政党——中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东同志万岁！
