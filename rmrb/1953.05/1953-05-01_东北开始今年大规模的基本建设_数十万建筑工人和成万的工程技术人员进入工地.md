Large-scale capital construction work has begun this year in Northeast China. Hundreds of thousands of construction troops from over a hundred construction companies, along with tens of thousands of construction engineers, technicians, and managers, have already entered the construction sites.

On the vast Northeast plains, many newly erected construction frames can be seen. An endless stream of trains, trucks, and carts transport various construction materials such as steel, reinforcing bars, cement, and wood to the various construction sites. A large number of construction machines, such as cranes, winches, and cement mixers, have begun to replace slow and laborious manual labor. On one extremely large-scale construction site, a precast reinforced concrete factory, a metal structure factory, a cement mixing factory, and a wood processing factory have been established. The concrete floor slabs, stairs, beams, columns, and metal structures produced by these factories will be loaded onto vehicles and transported to various sites, where cranes will install these massive objects onto tall buildings.

According to preliminary statistics, the total amount of capital construction work in Northeast China this year has increased by 84 percent compared to last year, with industrial capital construction accounting for 63 percent. In Anshan, China's steel capital, modern seamless steel pipe plants and thin plate rolling mills are being accelerated. In Harbin, construction has begun on a measuring tool and cutting tool factory with a higher degree of automation than the flax mill. Once completed, this factory will mass-produce standard and precise measuring tools and cutting tools needed by China's machine industry. In the coal and iron city of Benxi and the coal-rich areas of Fuxin, Jixi, and Liaoyuan, many vertical shafts, inclined shafts, and open-pit coal mines are under construction or will be constructed. The Liaodong silk spinning factory, which began construction last year, will be completed this year. Once completed, this factory can weave more than one million yards of beautiful and durable silk fabrics each year. This year, a new factory and several reconstructed factories specializing in the manufacture of agricultural machinery will also be built. Many new types of residential buildings, hospitals, sanatoriums, and fourteen universities and specialized schools are also under construction.

Many departments in Northeast China have launched intense activities to support capital construction. Mechanical factories in Shenyang, Fushun, Dalian, Jilin, Qiqihar, and other places have manufactured a large number of heavy-duty winches, road rollers, cement mixers, and drilling machines for capital construction sites; Mechanical Factory No. 15 has trial-produced highly precise universal milling machines and boring machines for new mechanical factories and will soon mass-produce them to equip China's new industries. Since the first quarter of this year, transportation companies in Northeast China, in addition to transporting construction materials with most of their vehicles, have also mobilized and organized more than 1,200 private cars and 54,800 rubber-tired carts to participate in transportation work in capital construction. State-owned commercial systems have established new large-scale stores in Shenyang, Anshan, Benxi, and other places to ensure that construction workers are fully supplied with daily necessities. Cooperative systems have also established many service departments at construction sites. Film projection teams organized by local trade unions, cultural and educational departments, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, as well as a large number of cultural and artistic personnel, have begun to set out in batches to enliven the cultural life of the construction sites.

    东北开始今年大规模的基本建设
    数十万建筑工人和成万的工程技术人员进入工地
    东北今年大规模的基本建设工作已经开始了。一百多个建筑工程公司的几十万建筑大军和数以万计的建筑工程师、技术人员和管理人员业已进入工地。
    在广阔的东北原野上，可以看见许多新搭成的建筑架。络绎不绝的火车、汽车、大车，向各个工地输送钢材、铁筋、水泥和木材等各种建筑器材。大批起重机、卷扬机、水泥搅拌机等建筑机械已经开始代替了缓慢吃力的体力劳动。一个规模极其巨大的工地上，已经设立了钢筋预置混凝土工厂、金属结构工厂、水泥搅拌工厂和木材加工工厂，这些工厂出产的混凝土楼板、楼梯、梁柱和金属结构等，将装车运往各个现场，然后由起重机把这些庞然大物安装到高大的建筑物上去。
    据初步统计，东北今年的基本建设工作总量比去年增加了百分之八十四，其中工业基本建设占百分之六十三。在我国钢都鞍山，现代化的无缝钢管厂和薄板轧钢厂正在加速建设中。在哈尔滨，已经着手建设一座自动化程度超过亚麻厂的量具刃具工厂，这座工厂建成后，将大量生产我国机器工业所需要的标准而精密的量具和刃具。在煤铁之城本溪和煤藏丰盛的阜新、鸡西、辽源等地，许多竖井、斜井和露天煤矿正在建设或将要建设。去年开始修建的辽东绢纺工厂，今年就要完成了。这座工厂建成后，每年可以织造一百多万码美丽坚固的丝织物。今年并将新建一座及改建几座专门制造农业机器的工厂。许多新型的住宅、医院、疗养院和十四所大学、专科学校等建筑工程，也已陆续施工。
    东北许多部门都展开了支援基本建设的紧张活动。沈阳、抚顺、大连、吉林、齐齐哈尔等地的机械工厂，为基本建设工地制造了大批重型的卷扬机、压道机、水泥搅拌机和钻探机；机械十五厂已为新的机械工厂试制了精密度很高的万能铣床和搪床设备，并即将大量生产，用来装备我国的新型工业。今年第一季度以来，东北各地的运输公司除以大部车辆运输建筑器材外，又动员和组织了一千二百多辆私人汽车和五万四千八百多辆胶轮大车参加基本建设中的运输工作。国营商业系统在沈阳、鞍山、本溪等地设立了新的大型商店，以便作到充分供应建筑工人的生活必需品。合作社系统也设立了许多工地服务部。各地工会、文教部门和中苏友好协会组织的电影放映队，以及大批文化艺术人员已开始分批出动，活跃工地的文化生活。
