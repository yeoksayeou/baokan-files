    With the Strong Support of the People's Government, Agricultural Production of Ethnic Minorities in Southwest China Develops Rapidly
    With the strong support of the People's Government, agricultural production of ethnic minorities in Southwest China has developed rapidly. The Yao ethnic group in Libo County, Guizhou Province, the ? ethnic group west of the Gaoligong Mountains in Yunnan Province, and the Tibetan ethnic group in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, mostly used wooden plows, wooden harrows, and wooden hoes. Some farming methods were still the primitive "slash-and-burn" type: when sowing, the land was burned first, without applying fertilizer, the seeds were scattered on the ground, and then they waited for the harvest. Land yields were extremely low. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, in order to overcome the production difficulties of the ethnic minorities, the People's Government issued huge interest-free agricultural loans and sent large quantities of iron farm tools, cattle, seeds, and grain to the ethnic minority farmers. The People's Government of Xikang Province provided Tibetan farmers with 110,000 pieces of iron farm tools free of charge. Some places also helped Tibetan farmers use new-style horse-drawn plows and seeders for farming. Farmers in the first district of Daofu County used to lack hoes, but now each household has an average of two hoes. According to preliminary statistics from eight ethnic minority counties in Guizhou Province, such as Leishan, Huishui, and Majiang, farmers of all ethnic groups used loans to purchase 4,460 head of cattle, more than 20,000 pigs, more than 50,000 pieces of farm tools, 1.17 million catties of rice, and 260,000 catties of fertilizer. In the Yaoshan area of Libo County, Guizhou Province, 670 Yao households, after receiving government loans, increased their cattle to 670 head, averaging one head of cattle per household; they raised 998 pigs, averaging one and a half pigs per household; and those who used to pull plows with people now use cattle, greatly changing the original production outlook. In March, when the People's Government transported large quantities of agricultural tools to Yaoshan from hundreds of miles away, the Yao people happily said: "Chairman Mao is warm! Ma dang luo ji!" (meaning Chairman Mao is good! Work hard to produce!).
    With the improvement of production tools, the farming techniques of various ethnic groups have also been greatly improved. Ethnic minority farmers in Gongshan and Fugong in Yunnan Province and the Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Xishuangbanna have begun to change their past backward farming systems, turning years of rotational land into annual land, and some have changed land that used to grow one crop a year to grow two crops. The Yi people in Talaxiang and Shansuxiang in Xinping County, Yunnan Province, who originally did not apply fertilizer to their fields and had no toilets or livestock pens, have now built toilets, pig pens, and manure pits, and have begun to accumulate fertilizer. The Xinduqiao Farm run by the state in Xikang Province and the Ganning Farm in the Tibetan Autonomous Region are both actively helping Tibetan people improve their farming techniques and replace them with improved varieties. According to the requirements of the local Tibetans, the Xinduqiao Farm has trial-planted 27 kinds of crops such as tea, cotton, hemp, and rapeseed, and cultivated more than 40 kinds of fruit tree seedlings such as peaches, persimmons, and apples transported from the Soviet Union and the Northeast. The Tibetans said, "If you succeed in the experiment, we will plant the same way." In areas where various ethnic groups live together, Han farmers also help fraternal ethnic minority farmers with spring plowing. When the Miao and Yi people in Tongmuwa and other places in Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, lacked water for irrigation during spring plowing, more than 200 Han farmers in nearby Toupu and other places helped them repair four large reservoirs that could irrigate 3,000 mu of land; at the same time, they also used practical demonstration methods to help the Miao and Yi farmers learn advanced farming techniques such as "sparsely scattering seedlings," salt water seed soaking, and composting.
    At present, the spring planting work has basically ended. Even in the coldest Kangzang Plateau region, new crops have emerged from the soil and are growing vigorously. Wheat crops in the eastern and southern counties of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and in the Mujiang area of Yajiang, Ganning, and Kangding have grown to four or five inches high, and farmers are beginning to weed the fields.

    在人民政府大力扶助下
    西南少数民族农业生产迅速发展
    西南各少数民族在人民政府大力扶助下，农业生产迅速获得发展。贵州省荔波县的瑶族、云南省高黎贡山西边的?族、西康省藏族自治区的藏族等，原来大部使用木犁、木耙、木锄；耕作方法有的仍是原始的“刀耕火种”：播种时，放火烧地后，不施肥料，把种籽撒在地里，就等着收割。土地产量极低。今年春耕开始，人民政府为克服各少数民族生产上的困难，发放了巨额的无利农业贷款，把大批铁制农具、耕牛、种籽和粮食送到各民族农民手中。西康省人民政府无代价地供应给藏族农民十一万件铁制农具，有的地方还帮助藏族农民用新式马拉犁和播种机进行耕作。道孚县第一区农民，过去缺乏锄头，现在每一户都平均有两把锄头了。据贵州省雷山、惠水、麻江等八个少数民族聚居县初步统计，各族农民用贷款购买耕牛达四千四百六十头、猪二万多只、农具五万多件、大米一百一十七万斤、肥料二十六万斤。该省荔波县瑶山一带六百七十多户瑶族农民，在得到政府贷款后，耕牛增至六百七十头，每户平均有耕牛一头；养猪九百九十八只，每户平均喂猪一只半；原来用人拉犁的，现在都用耕牛了，大大地改变了原来的生产面貌。三月间当人民政府从百里外把大批农具运到瑶山的时候，瑶族人民都高兴地说：“毛主席暖！麻当落几！”（意即毛主席好！努力生产！）
    随着生产工具的改良，各民族耕作技术亦有很大改进。云南省的贡山、福贡和西双版纳傣族自治区的少数民族农民，已开始改变了过去的落后耕作制度，把多年的轮耕地改成了年耕地，有的还把一年种一季作物的地改种两季。该省新平县他拉乡、山苏乡的彝族，原来种田不施肥料，也没有厕所、畜厩，今年已修建厕所、猪圈和粪坑，开始积肥。西康省国营新都桥农场、藏族自治区干宁农场，都积极帮助藏民改进耕作技术，调换优良品种。新都桥农场根据当地藏民的要求，试种了茶、棉、麻、油菜等二十七种作物，并栽培了从苏联及东北运来的桃、柿、苹果等四十多种果木苗。藏民说：“你们试验成功，我们就照样种。”在各族人民杂居区内，汉族农民并帮助兄弟民族农民进行春耕。贵州省贵筑县桐木洼等地苗族、彝族春耕时缺水灌田，附近头堡等地的二百多个汉族农民，就帮助他们修好了四个能灌田三千亩的大水塘；同时，还用实地示范方法，帮助苗、彝族农民学习“稀撒秧”、盐水浸种和堆肥等先进耕作技术。
    目前春耕播种工作已基本结束。连最寒冷的康藏高原地区，新的作物也已露土茁长了，藏族自治区东部和南部各县及雅江、干宁、康定木雅区等地的麦类作物，已长有四、五寸高，农民正开始锄头遍草。    （本报重庆记者站）
