    In order to implement the Central Committee's instructions on cadre theoretical education for 1953-1954, the Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held the sixth theoretical instructor study class on May 11th.

    This study class brought together 199 full-time theoretical instructors from all parts of the province (including 47 full-time directors of teaching affairs and 51 administrative staff from spare-time political schools), and 47 part-time theoretical instructors. These cadres generally have a junior high school education or above and have studied courses such as "Political Common Sense," "History of Social Development," and "Political Economy." Most have served as theoretical instructors since 1952 and have some teaching experience.

    This theoretical instructor study class will spend one month teaching the intermediate-level course "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the elementary-level course "Reader on Common Knowledge of Economic Construction." The "History of the CPSU (B)" will mainly cover Chapters 9 and 10, combined with the study of several documents by Lenin and Stalin on socialist economic construction, and will include two special reports on China's economic construction. In order to help cadres understand the historical environment in which the Soviet Union was conducting economic construction at that time, the class will first spend a week teaching the last section of Chapter 6 and Chapters 7 and 8 of the "History of the CPSU (B)." The "Reader on Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" will mainly cover the first four chapters. The learning method will emphasize both classroom instruction and self-study, and will organize a certain number of discussions based on the issues. The entire course will be taught by Zhang Shiying and Li Jianbai, deputy secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee, Zhao Ziping and Zhang Xiangling, deputy directors of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Liu Zhenyao, deputy director of the Industry Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Luo Zicheng, deputy director of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and the director and deputy director of the Provincial Government's Department of Commerce.

    Secondly, in order to exchange experiences in teaching work in various regions and improve theoretical education work, in the first week of the study class, various regions introduced their experiences and problems in teaching, branch leadership, helping cadres digest the courses they have learned, and the learning of cadres in the countryside, and focused on discussing how to correctly grasp theory and appropriately connect it with reality. The Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will conduct a summary of the theoretical learning of cadres in various counties based on the reports from various regions.

    This study class will end on June 15th.

    执行中央关于干部理论教育的指示
    黑龙江省委举办理论教员研究班
    为了执行中央关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示，中共黑龙江省委宣传部于五月十一日举办了第六期理论教员研究班。
    这次研究班集中了全省各地专职理论教员一百九十九名（其中有业余政治学校专职教导主任四十七名，干事五十一名），兼职理论教员四十七名。这些干部一般都具有初中以上文化程度，并学过“政治常识”、“社会发展史”、“政治经济学”等课程；多数都是从一九五二年就担任理论教员，有一定的教学经验。
    这期理论教员研究班将以一个月的时间，分别讲授中级组课程“联共（布）党史”及初级组课程“经济建设常识读本”。“联共（布）党史”主要传授九、十两章，结合学习列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设的若干文件，并作两次有关中国经济建设的专题报告。为了使干部了解苏联当时进行经济建设时所处的历史环境，并用一周时间首先讲授“联共（布）党史”第六章最后一节及七、八两章。“经济建设常识读本”主要讲授前四章。学习方法是以上课和自学并重，并根据问题组织一定次数的讨论。全部课程由省委副书记张士英、李剑白，省委宣传部副部长赵子平、张向凌，省委工业部副部长刘振尧，省委农村工作部副部长骆子程及省府商业厅正副厅长等同志分别担任讲师。
    其次，为了交流各地教学工作经验，改进理论教育工作，在研究班开始第一周，各地介绍了有关教学、支部领导、帮助干部消化所学课程及下乡干部学习等方面的经验与问题，并着重讨论了如何正确地掌握理论和恰当地联系实际等问题。中共黑龙江省委宣传部将根据各地汇报情况，对各县干部理论学习进行一次总结。
    这期研究班将于六月十五日结束。
