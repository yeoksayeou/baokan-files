    The People's Government of Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, Should Rapidly Strengthen Locust Control Work
    Readers Binbin and Fudong wrote: The People's Government of Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, does not pay enough attention to locust control work. In early May, cadres from the East China Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and the Xinhailian Locust Control Station were dispatched to the county to assist in locust control work and impart locust control techniques. However, the county's People's Government believes that it is still too early for locust control and, complacent and麻痹 because of past achievements in locust control, does not pay attention to this work. They only perfunctorily respond to the instructions of the higher-level People's Government on establishing a locust control command structure without genuinely assigning personnel; they also delay and fail to assist in the work of transferring cadres to learn locust control techniques. When the cadres from the Locust Control Station who were sent to the county went to the countryside to work, they discovered that the locust scouting work in the county had not yet been carried out well, and locust nymphs had already been discovered (such as second-instar locust nymphs in Wuguan Township, Nancheng District). The comrades from the Locust Control Station reported the locust situation in various places to the leading comrades of the county People's Government and again suggested strengthening locust control work. The county magistrate said at the time that the locust control headquarters had been established and personnel were being transferred. But so far, the locust control headquarters is still an empty shell.
    The locust eradication work is now approaching a critical period. It is suggested that the People's Government of Guanyun County quickly change its attitude of not paying attention to locust eradication work, so as to avoid causing unnecessary losses to the people.

    江苏灌云县人民政府应该迅速加强治蝗工作
    读者彬彬、阜东来信：江苏省灌云县人民政府不重视防治蝗虫的工作。五月初，华东农林局和新海连蝗虫防治站先后派干部到该县协助治蝗工作，传授治蝗技术。但该县人民政府认为治蝗时间还早，并认为过去治蝗有成绩，因而自满麻痹，不重视这个工作。他们对上级人民政府关于建立治蝗指挥机构的指示只是应付了事，而不真正配备人员；对抽调干部学习治蝗技术的工作也一拖再拖，不予协助。派到该县的蝗虫防治站干部下乡工作时，发现全县侦查蝗虫的工作还未很好开展，蝗蝻已有发现（如南城区五官乡已发现二龄的蝗蝻）。蝗虫防治站的同志向县人民政府领导同志汇报了各地蝗情，再次建议加强防治蝗虫的工作。该县县长当时说是治蝗指挥部已成立，正在抽调人员。但至今治蝗指挥部还是一个空架子。
    目前灭蝗工作已近紧张时期，建议灌云县人民政府迅速改变不重视灭蝗工作的态度，以免使人民遭受不应有的损失。
