Implementing Economic Accounting System Must Mobilize the Masses
Cao Naikang, Director of the Organization and Technology Bureau, Central Ministry of Commerce

After the Handan and Jinan secondary-level wholesale department stores implemented economic accounting, new phenomena emerged that were absent under the supply system. Employees began to use their brains, come up with ideas, and make many new creations. However, these two wholesale department stores had different leadership methods, so the results they achieved also differed.

When the Handan wholesale department store established its accounts and verified its assets, the leadership assigned tasks to everyone and mobilized all employees to study operating methods and learn and discuss the new system. Everyone had a relatively clear understanding of the tasks of the wholesale station, and they were able to face the various department stores within the supply scope in their operations, achieving good results. For example, they sent people to the Fengfeng Mining Area to contact retail companies and cooperatives, and in one instance, they concluded a transaction of 1.4 billion yuan. They also sent special personnel, carrying samples and price lists of goods, to promote sales in Anyang, Changzhi, Tangyin, Xinxiang, and even Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xi'an, and to understand the sales situation in the supply area. According to the needs of the stores, they sent special personnel to the Tianjin Central Wholesale Department Store to purchase goods, and processed slow-selling goods in stock according to consumer needs, and then promoted their sales.

When Handan Station began to abolish the treasury remittance system, it distinguished all property into its own funds and fixed-quota loans. According to the proportion of different commodities, it carefully calculated the number of turnover days, and comprehensively calculated the total turnover period and fund limit for all commodities. They disposed of surplus commodities, asked the provincial company to transfer commodities that could not be sold locally, and formulated specific promotion plans for commodities that could be sold locally. With the consent of the provincial company, they converted the above-quota commodities into loans from the opening bank. They established a contractual supply relationship with lower-level stores and carried out transfers and settlements through the bank; although there are still shortcomings in the implementation, they can generally recover the payment on time. They further felt that wrong shipments, wrong accounts, inconsistent cargo receipts, and discrepancies in the numbers between the invoice and the goods, as well as the other party delaying acceptance, and failure to recover the payment, all affected the capital turnover. Therefore, they launched a mass anti-error campaign, exposing 720 errors, which were reduced by 90 percent during the review.

However, because the leaders of the Handan Wholesale Station still had serious bureaucratic work styles and residual supply system management thinking, it also hindered the further development of all businesses. Last year, the market needed beige socks, and they purchased them from Yangliuqing, but they did not specify the specifications, quantity, and time in advance. As a result, the goods were not delivered until the season had passed, and some specifications did not meet the needs, and too many goods were sent, resulting in backlog. The station did not study and implement the advanced experience introduced by the higher authorities and the internal liaison system discussed by the employees. During the inspection, the leading cadres said: "Under preparation, in progress." The masses of employees reflected that many things are "the bottom moves, but the top doesn't."

The Jinan Wholesale Department Store initially sent five or six cadres to contact various points in the surrounding area, and in five or six days, they completed transactions of more than 2 billion yuan. Salesman Deng Jianmin noted that locally produced towels were not easy to sell and were heavily overstocked, and the factory was almost shut down. After a month of painstaking research, he found out the habits and needs of towel consumers in the supply area and suggested that the processing plant change the specifications of the towels and process them according to the required quantity. As a result, the produced towels were quickly sold out. This example tells all commercial workers: we must process orders and guide production according to the needs and habits of the people. But these achievements are only individual phenomena. Because when the Jinan Wholesale Station established its accounts and verified its assets, a few people stipulated the fund limit and system, and did not mobilize the masses of employees to discuss it well, and the tasks were not clearly explained, and everyone did not understand the position of the wholesale station and the role it should play. They regarded the market promotion of the wholesale retail department as their own task, and the task of supplying the surrounding stores as an ancillary task, so the contact with the stores was not close or active, forming a phenomenon of separation between purchase and sale. This is clearly wrong.

The contract system and the transfer and settlement system of the Jinan Wholesale Station have not been discussed and studied by all employees, so most people do not understand. Hundreds of millions of yuan in payments from department stores have not been recovered for a long time, and the wholesale station has not seriously started from the contract conditions and the improvement of its own work to prevent the excuses for stores to delay, and urged the bank to supervise the contracts of both parties and implement the transfer and settlement. Therefore, everyone thinks that the asset verification is just "old wine in new bottles".

From the above-mentioned advantages and disadvantages and the problems that have occurred, it can be seen that the advantage of asset verification at the Handan Wholesale Station is that it fully mobilized the masses, and there is an organic combination between the station and the stores; the advantages that appeared at the Jinan Wholesale Station are prominent, but individual. The shortcoming of the Handan Wholesale Station is that the supply system thinking was not eliminated under the cover of bureaucracy, and as a result, some good things were done badly. The cadres of the Jinan Wholesale Station have a unclear understanding of the position and role of the wholesale station, the plan has not been discussed by the masses, the required funds have not been accurately calculated, and the system has not been well studied, so it cannot give greater play to the role of the wholesale station, and the system cannot be mastered and used by the masses. Therefore, the establishment of accounts and asset verification must mobilize the masses, expose the shortcomings in past work, and launch a struggle against bureaucracy and the supply system management thinking; through mass research on credit methods, settlement methods, contract conditions, and the formulation of internal liaison systems; mobilizing the masses to discuss commodity circulation plans and financial plans, and carefully calculate the time required for each segment of the commodity circulation process; in this way, all employees will understand their tasks, and they will also have a clear idea of the commodity circulation, which is convenient for mastering it, and all systems in economic accounting will be truly used by the masses, and mass creativity will continue to emerge.

    实行经济核算制必须发动群众
    中央商业部组织技术局局长　曹乃康
    邯郸、济南两个二级百货批发站在实行经济核算后，都出现了在实行供给制经营制度时所没有的新气象。职工们开始动脑筋、想办法，并有不少的新创造。但是，这两个百货批发站的领导方法不同，因此，他们所收到的效果也就不同。
    邯郸百货批发站在建站核资时，领导方面向大家交代了任务，发动全站职工研究了经营方法，学习和讨论了新的制度。大家对批发站的任务认识得比较明确，在经营上能够面对供应范围内的各个百货商店，获得了较好的成绩。例如，他们曾派人去峰峰矿区与零售公司、合作社进行联系，一次成交了十四亿元。他们还派出专人，携带货物的样品和价格表，到安阳、长治、汤阴、新乡甚至郑州、洛阳、西安去推销，并且了解供应区内的销货情况；他们根据商店的需要，派专人到天津中央百货批发站采购商品，并将库存的不易销售的商品，根据消费者的需要进行加工，然后推销出去。
    邯郸站在开始解除金库回笼制度的时候，就把全部财产分清了自有资金和定额贷款；按照不同商品所占的比重，仔细计算周转天数，综合出全部商品总的周转期和资金限额；处理了多余商品，把本地不能销的商品请省公司调走，把本地能销的作出具体的推销计划，经省公司同意，转为开户银行超定额商品的贷款。他们和下级商店建立了合同供应关系，通过银行进行划拨清算；虽然执行中尚有缺点，但一般还能按时收回货款。他们进一步感到发错了货，记错了账，货票不同行，票货数字不符，对方拖延承兑，货款收不回来等现象，影响了资金周转，于是开展了群众性的反差错运动，揭发出来七百二十件差错，到复查时，差错减少了百分之九十。
    但是，由于邯郸批发站的领导人还存在着严重的官僚主义作风和残余的供给制经营思想，也就阻碍着全部业务进一步的发展。去年市场上需要米色袜子，他们曾向杨柳青采购，事先不订好规格、数量和时间，结果季节过了货才发到，有的规格不符需要，而且发来的货太多，也就造成了积压现象。该站对于上级介绍的先进经验和职工们讨论出来的内部连系制度，没有很好地研究执行，检查时，领导干部却说：“在准备中，进行中”。职工群众反映说：许多事情是“下动上不动”。
    济南百货批发站最初曾派了五、六个干部到周围各点进行联系，在五、六天时间内成交了二十余亿元。营业员邓建民鉴于当地生产的毛巾不易销售，积压很多，工厂几乎停工；经过一个月的苦心钻研，找出了供应范围内毛巾消费者的习惯和需要，建议加工厂改变了毛巾的规格，按照需要数量分别进行加工。这样，生产出来的毛巾很快卖光了。这个范例告诉全体商业工作者：必须按照人民的需要和习惯进行加工订货，指导生产。但这些成就只是个别现象。因为济南批发站在建站核资时，是由少数人规定了资金限额和制度，没有很好地发动职工群众讨论，任务也交代得不够清楚，大家也不了解批发站所处的地位和应起的作用。他们把批发门市部的市场推销看成自营的任务，把供应周围各商店的任务看成附带的任务，于是对商店的联系不密切也不主动，形成购销脱节的现象。这显然是错误的。
    济南批发站的合同制度，划拨清算制度，都没有经过全体职工讨论研究，所以大多数人都不明白。百货商店百余亿元的货款长期不能收回，批发站也没有认真地从合同条件上和改进本身工作上着手，杜绝商店拖延的借口，并督促银行对双方的合同进行监督并实行划拨清算。于是大家认为，核资只是“换汤不换药”。
    从以上例举的优缺点和发生的问题中可以看出：邯郸批发站建站核资的优点是比较充分地发动了群众，而且站、店之间是有机结合的；济南批发站出现的优点虽然是突出的，但是个别的。邯郸批发站的缺点是供给制思想在官僚主义的掩护下没有肃清，结果把有的好事办坏了。济南批发站的干部则对批发站的地位与作用认识不清，计划没有经过群众讨论，没有精确计算需要的资金，没有很好地研究制度，所以就不能更大地发挥批发站的作用，制度也不能被群众所掌握与运用。因此，建站核资必须发动群众，揭发过去工作中的缺点，开展反对官僚主义和供给制经营思想的斗争；通过群众研究信贷办法，结算办法，合同条件，制定内部联系制度；发动群众讨论商品流转计划和财务计划，仔细计算商品流转过程中每段所需时间；这样就能使全体职工明白他们的任务，对商品流转也能心中有数，便于掌握，经济核算中一切制度真正被群众所运用，群众性的创造也就会不断的出现。
