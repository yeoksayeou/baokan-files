    Hebei Province Cooperatives Should Correct Wasteful Fertilizer Supply Practices in Subordinate Units
    Reader Wang Jianhua writes: The Zhangjiakou Office Production Materials Wholesale Station of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative transported a large quantity of soybean cakes from Huanggu Tun, Shenyang, Northeast China to Xiahuayuan in January this year, intending to supply them to Weixian farmers for spring plowing fertilization. However, the cost of these soybean cakes was as high as 700+ yuan per jin, and the selling price was 900 yuan per jin; while the local black bean price was only 800 yuan per jin. The farmers did not want to buy these soybean cakes, and the station did not promptly handle them. By early April, these soybean cakes had been left at the station for more than eighty days, and the station finally decided to transport them to Tianjin, Lianzhen, Bozhen and other places for promotion. This not only wasted more than 500 million yuan in handling, loading and unloading, storage, and management expenses (estimated only at Xiahuayuan Station), and tied up more than 5 billion yuan in national funds; more seriously, this batch of fertilizer was too late for spring plowing.
    It is understood that similar situations have occurred in Xuanhua, Huailai, Tianzhen, Yanggao and other places. For example, more than 1.4 million jin of soybean cakes transported to Xuanhua have been transferred elsewhere, and recently another 1.5 million jin are to be returned. The waste caused by such round-trip transportation is enormous. It is hoped that the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative will inspect the work of the Production Materials Wholesale Station of the Zhangjiakou Office, correct the above situation, so as not to cause greater losses to the people.

### 河北省合作社应纠正所属单位  肥料供应工作中的浪费现象

    河北省合作社应纠正所属单位
    肥料供应工作中的浪费现象
    读者王建华来信：河北省供销合作总社张家口办事处生产资料批发栈在今年一月份由东北沈阳皇姑屯运大批豆饼到下花园，准备供给蔚县农民春耕施肥用。但这批豆饼的成本每斤即达七百多元，卖价每斤达九百元；而当地的黑豆价格才八百元一斤。农民不要买这些豆饼，该栈也没及时处理它。到四月初，这批豆饼已在车站搁了八十多天，该栈才决定改运天津、连镇、泊镇等地推销。这不但浪费了搬运、装卸、囤存、保管等费用五亿多元（仅据下花园车站一处的估计），积压了国家资金五十多亿元；更严重的是这批肥料已经赶不上春耕使用了。
    据了解：宣化、怀来、天镇、阳高等地也发生了类似情况。如运到宣化的豆饼已有一百四十多万斤改运别处，最近还有一百五十多万斤要退回。这样往返搬运造成的浪费是巨大的。希望河北省供销合作总社检查张家口办事处生产资料批发栈的工作，纠正以上情况，以免给人民造成更大损失。
