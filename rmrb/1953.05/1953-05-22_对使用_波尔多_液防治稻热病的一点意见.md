    Some Suggestions on Using Bordeaux Mixture to Prevent Rice Blast
    Letter from Ma Runzhi, Plant Protection Division, Ministry of Agriculture: In recent years, rice blast (rice plague) has been found in some rice-growing areas. For example, in 1952, panicle blast occurred in Xiaozhan, Tianjin, Hebei Province, etc. The general rate of withered panicles reached more than 20%, which greatly affected the rice harvest. Spraying Bordeaux mixture in the field can achieve good results in preventing rice blast. However, last year, some places sprayed rice with Bordeaux mixture mixed according to the general common ratio, that is, one jin of copper sulfate (blue vitriol), one jin of quicklime, and one hundred jin of water, resulting in phytotoxicity, causing brown spots and even scorching of the rice leaves. This is because rice is different from other crops, and the amount of lime and water used in this compound is too small. It is said that this year Jiangsu and other places are again preparing to focus on using the above-mentioned ratio of Bordeaux mixture to prevent rice blast. In order to prevent phytotoxicity, I suggest that the agricultural technology guidance departments in various rice-growing areas first experiment with spraying a double-dose lime Bordeaux mixture (one jin of copper sulfate, two jin of quicklime, two hundred jin of water, plus an appropriate amount of adhesive) once during the seedling stage and tillering stage, and spraying a triple-dose lime Bordeaux mixture (one jin of copper sulfate, three jin of quicklime, two hundred jin of water, plus an appropriate amount of adhesive) once during the booting stage and heading stage. After gaining experience, promote it to the masses. Of course, the number of sprays should be increased or decreased depending on the different disease incidence and specific conditions in different places.

### 对使用“波尔多”液防治稻热病的一点意见

    对使用“波尔多”液防治稻热病的一点意见
    中央农业部植物保护司马润芝来信：近年来某些水稻区域发现了稻热病（稻瘟病）。如一九五二年河北省天津小站等地，发生穗茎稻热病，一般枯穗率达百分之二十以上，大大影响了水稻的丰收。要防治稻热病，田间喷布“波尔多”液的办法可以收到很好的效果。但去年有些地方按一般通用比例，即按一斤硫酸铜（蓝矾），一斤生石灰，一百斤水配成的“波尔多”液来喷布水稻，结果引起了药害，使水稻叶部显出褐色斑点甚至枯焦。这是因为水稻与其它作物有不同之处，这种配合剂所用的石灰量与水量都小了。据说今年江苏等地又准备重点使用上述比例配成的“波尔多”液来防治稻热病。为了防止药害，我建议各水稻区农业技术指导部门先试验在苗期及分蘖期喷布石灰倍量式波尔多液
    （一斤硫酸铜，二斤生石灰，二百斤水，加用适量黏着剂）各一次，孕穗期及齐穗期喷布石灰三倍量式波尔多液（一斤硫酸铜三斤生石灰，二百斤水，加用适量黏着剂）各一次的办法，取得经验后再向群众推广。自然，其喷射回数应根据各地不同的发病及具体情况，酌量增加或减少。
