    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 22nd: The Yoshida Liberal Party, facing unprecedented isolation in the Diet, hastily formed a single-party cabinet headed by Yoshida Shigeru on the 21st. Most of the original members of the previous Yoshida cabinet, which fell after a vote of no confidence in the Diet, reappeared. The resurgence of the Yoshida cabinet, which actively implements policies to revive Japanese militarism, has immediately met with fierce opposition from the Japanese people. The bourgeois opposition parties, which are vying for power with the Yoshida Liberal Party, are also launching fierce attacks. All sectors of Tokyo are widely predicting that the fifth Yoshida cabinet will be another "short-lived cabinet."
    Yoshida's new single-party cabinet has a total of sixteen members, ten of whom were members of the previous cabinet. Ogata Taketora, the wartime intelligence chief of the Koiso cabinet, Yoshida's right-hand man, and a war criminal, remains Deputy Prime Minister; Okazaki Katsuo, deeply favored by his American masters for faithfully implementing a traitorous and pro-American foreign policy, remains Foreign Minister; Kimura Tokutaro, the drafter of the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" and an active advocate of rebuilding the Japanese fascist army, remains the director of the disguised military "Security Agency" and a Minister of State; Ogasawara Sankuro, who has close ties with Japanese zaibatsu and is himself a "former banker," the original Minister of International Trade and Industry and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, was reassigned to Minister of Finance, and his new position was hailed by Japanese monopoly capitalists.
    The formation of the basically unchanged new Yoshida cabinet immediately met with angry opposition from the Japanese people. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan, issued a statement pointing out that Yoshida's rule is an obstacle to Japan's national independence and peace. The selection of new cabinet members shows that Yoshida will step up rearmament and restore reactionary laws to suppress workers. The statement also announced that it will launch a nationwide demonstration against the Yoshida cabinet on June 10.
    The new Yoshida cabinet has also been sharply criticized by various bourgeois opposition parties. The Reform Party issued a formal statement stating that the new cabinet is "completely a reappearance of the Yoshida cabinet that was distrusted by the last Diet." The Reform Party said, "Yoshida's new Finance Minister and Foreign Minister choices show that he is unwilling to change the Liberal Party's important foreign and financial policies at all." The statement of the right-wing Socialist Party said that the new cabinet is a "short-lived cabinet," "rotten and smelly, without any new smell, so it will be as unstable as the previous cabinet." The left-wing Socialist Party statement pointed out: "The new Yoshida cabinet shows that it will rely more on the United States and strengthen rearmament," "Therefore, it is as reactionary as the previous cabinet that was overthrown by the opposition party's no-confidence motion in the Diet, if not more reactionary."
    Yoshida's previous cabinet had brought in people from two small parties as cabinet members as a decoration for a single-party cabinet. When he formed the new cabinet this time, he knew that the cabinet would be short-lived, but he cancelled this decoration and formed a purely Yoshida Liberal Party cabinet. According to Tokyo "financial circles," the composition of the new Yoshida cabinet is to facilitate the realization of the conspiracy of a "united conservative regime" in the future in accordance with the wishes of the US-Japan monopoly capital groups. They said that the "strong partisan color" of the new Yoshida cabinet is "a preparatory step for making policy adjustments with the Reform Party in the future and finally establishing a conservative alliance." Kyodo News Agency quoted Tokyo "well-informed political sources" as further confirming this point, saying: "Prime Minister Yoshida and Deputy Prime Minister Ogata Taketora selected the members of his fifth cabinet with the intention of a large-scale reorganization in the future."

    日本人民和各在野党激烈反对吉田新内阁
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：在国会中陷于空前孤立地位的吉田自由党已在二十一日仓促组成了以吉田茂为首的一党内阁。因国会通过不信任案而下台的上届吉田内阁的原班人马大部分再度粉墨登场。积极执行复活日本军国主义政策的吉田内阁的再度登台，立即受到日本人民的激烈的反对。与吉田自由党争权夺利的各资产阶级在野党也加以猛烈攻击。东京各界已在普遍预料第五次吉田内阁又将是一个“短命内阁”。
    吉田新的一党内阁共有十六个阁员，其中有十个是上次内阁的阁员。战时小矶内阁的情报总裁、吉田的左右手、战犯绪方竹虎仍任副首相；以忠实执行卖国媚美外交政策而深为美国主子所宠幸的冈崎胜男仍任外务相；法西斯的“防止破坏活动法”的起草人、积极倡导重建日本法西斯军队的木村笃太郎仍任变相军部“保安厅”的长官兼国务相；与日本财阀有密切联系而且本身就是一个“前银行家”的原通商产业相兼经济审议厅长官的小笠原三九郎改任藏相，他的新职受到日本垄断资本家的欢呼。
    基本上原封不动的吉田新内阁的组成，立即受到日本人民愤怒的反对。日本最大的工会团体日本工会总评议会发表声明指出：吉田的统治是日本民族独立与和平的障碍。新内阁的人选表明吉田将加紧重整军备和恢复镇压工人的反动法律。声明并宣布将在六月十日发动一个全国规模的反对吉田内阁的示威运动。
    吉田新内阁也遭到各资产阶级在野党的尖锐抨击。改进党发表正式声明指出：新内阁“完全是已被上次国会不信任的吉田内阁的重现”。改进党说：“吉田的新藏相和外务相人选表明了他一点也不愿改变自由党的重要外交和财政政策”。右派社会党的声明说：新内阁是“短命内阁”，“既烂且臭，没有一点新的气味，因此将和前次内阁一样不稳定”。左派社会党声明指出：“吉田新内阁表明了它将更加依赖美国和加强重整军备”，“因此，它和上次在国会被反对党不信任案推翻了的内阁同样反动，如果不说它更为反动的话”。
    吉田的上次内阁，曾拉进了两个小党派人士担任阁员，作为一党内阁的点缀。他这次组织新内阁时，一面明知这个内阁是短命的，一面却取消这种点缀，组成了清一色的吉田自由党内阁。据东京“财政界人士”透露：吉田新内阁的这种构成是为了便于按照美日垄断资本集团的意旨在将来实现“联合保守政权”的阴谋。他们说：吉田新内阁的这种“强烈的党派色彩”，是“将来和改进党一道作政策上的调整，并最后成立保守派联盟的一个准备步骤”。共同社援引的东京“消息灵通政界人士”的话进一步证实了这一点，他们说：“吉田首相和绪方竹虎副首相挑选他的第五届内阁阁员是打算好了在将来大规模改组的。”
