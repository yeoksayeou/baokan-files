    In the southwestern border region of our country, there is a plateau area with an average elevation of more than 4,000 meters above sea level, which is the famous "Roof of the World," the Kham-Tibet Plateau.

    Vast land is one of the characteristics of the Kham-Tibet Plateau. It takes more than forty days to travel from the foot of the Tanggula Mountains to the foothills of the Himalayas; it takes about two months to ride a horse from Lhasa to Gada K in the Ali region. There are countless towering snow-capped mountains, forests that block out the sky, boundless grasslands, and vast agricultural areas. In March, when the northern pastoral areas are still in the harsh winter, and the herdsmen have not yet driven their flocks to the vast grasslands, the central valley areas are already in full bloom, and the farmers are busy carrying out spring plowing and sowing in the fields, while in the Bomi southern region in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, it has already entered the hot season, and early-maturing barley and rapeseed are about to be harvested.

    The products of the Kham-Tibet Plateau include the cold-resistant crop highland barley, which grows at an altitude of 4,300 meters, rice suitable for planting in hot and rainy areas, and tropical products such as bananas and pomelos. Musk, deer antlers, caterpillar fungus, and fritillary bulbs are well-known specialty products of the Kham-Tibet Plateau, and otter, lynx, fox, tiger, leopard, and other valuable furs are also produced in large quantities. The virgin forests in southwestern Xikang and the Himalayan regions of Tibet are the wealth of the plateau. In a certain forest area alone, there are about 11 billion cubic meters of timber available for construction. Dozens of minerals have been discovered in various places, and many rare industrial raw materials are abundantly stored on the plateau. The granite produced on the Kham-Tibet Plateau has beautiful patterns and a hard texture, making it the best building material. Famous buildings in Tibet, such as the Potala Palace and Tashilhunpo Monastery, are built of granite. The Yarlung Tsangpo River and the large and small rapids in the southern mountainous areas are natural power sources for generating electricity, and various types of fish abound in the rivers and lakes. The numerous inland lakes in northern Kham-Tibet Plateau are an inexhaustible source of salt and borax. Every summer, herdsmen drive their cattle and sheep there to collect salt, and in the dried-up salt lakes, the salt layer is like snow in winter.

    The plateau has vast natural pastures - the famous northern Kham pastoral area and the northern Tibet "Changtang" pastoral area. The area of the grassland accounts for about two-thirds of the entire Kham-Tibet Plateau, and many cattle and sheep graze on these lush pastures. The wool, leather, butter, and meat produced in the pastoral areas not only meet the needs of the people on the plateau, but also are sold in large quantities every year. When the autumn season of lush grass and strong livestock arrives, the herdsmen transport various pastoral products to the agricultural areas with yaks and pack sheep to exchange for grain and various daily necessities. In winter, herds of wild horses, wild deer, antelopes, bears, lynx, foxes and other wild animals come to the plateau from the northern lake area, and the herdsmen begin their hunting life.

    There are also vast agricultural areas on the plateau. In the river valleys on both sides of the Jinsha River, Lancang River, and Nujiang River in western Xikang and the Bomi area, there are fertile fields everywhere. On the alluvial plains of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and Lhasa River basins in central Tibet, the soil is fertile and the climate is mild, known as the "Tibetan Granary." The grain produced here every year accounts for one-quarter of the total grain production in Tibet. Many temperate and tropical crops and fruits can grow on the plateau. The highland barley and wheat produced on the plateau have large grains and high resistance to cold and drought, and are excellent agricultural varieties.

    The various abundant natural resources on the Kham-Tibet Plateau were the targets of imperialist plunder in the past. The Tibetan people who live here, although working hard every year, still live in poverty. Since the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government signed the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, with the help of the Central People's Government and the troops stationed in Tibet, the agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, commerce, culture, and education in Tibet and western Xikang have gradually recovered and developed. There were no schools or hospitals on the plateau in the past. Now, ethnic schools have been established, and hospitals and clinics have been established or are being prepared in major towns. The People's Bank of China has issued interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans and low-interest handicraft loans in Tibet and Xikang. The state-owned Tibet Trading Corporation purchased wool that had been overstocked in Tibet for many years and produced after liberation at reasonable prices. Last year, the main agricultural areas of the Kham-Tibet Plateau achieved a bumper harvest unprecedented in the past ten years. The output of highland barley and wheat doubled compared to 1951.

    丰饶的康藏高原
    新华社记者  郗平
    在我国西南边疆，有一片平均拔海四千公尺以上的高原地带，这便是著名的“世界屋脊”康藏高原。
    土地辽阔，是康藏高原的特色之一。从唐古拉山下到喜马拉雅山麓，要走四十多天；从拉萨骑马到阿里地区的噶大克，大约要两个月。这里有着无数高耸入云的大雪山，遮天蔽日的森林，一望无际的大草原和广阔的农业区。三月里，当北部牧区还是严寒的冬季，牧民们还没有把羊群赶到大草原去的时候，中部河谷地带已经百花盛开，农民们正在田野里紧张地进行春耕播种，而在雅鲁藏布江下游的波密南部地区，却已进入炎热的季节，早熟的大麦、油菜即将收割了。
    康藏高原的物产，有生长在拔海四千三百公尺高地的耐寒作物青稞，有适应高温多雨地区种植的水稻，还有热带的产物——香蕉和柚子。麝香、鹿茸、虫草和贝母，是康藏高原名闻中外的特产，水獭、猞猁、狐、虎、豹等名贵皮毛，也有大量出产。西康西南部和西藏喜马拉雅山区的原始森林，更是高原上的财富，仅某地森林区可供建筑用的木材就约有一百一十亿立方公尺。各地已被发现的矿产有数十种之多，许多稀少的工业原料，都在高原上大量蕴藏着。康藏高原所产的花岗石，花纹美丽、质地坚硬，是最好的建筑材料，西藏著名的建筑物如布达拉宫和扎什伦布寺，都是用花岗石砌成的。雅鲁藏布江和南部山区中的大小激流都是天然的发电动力，各河流和湖泊里并盛产各种鱼类。康藏高原北部星罗棋布的内六湖，是取之不尽的食盐和硼砂的产地。每年夏天，牧民们便赶着牛羊到那里取盐，在干涸了的盐湖里，盐层像冬季的积雪一样。
    高原上有广阔的天然牧场——著名的康北牧区和藏北“羌塘”牧区。草原的面积约占整个康藏高原的三分之二，很多的牛、羊放牧在这些牧草肥美的草地上。各牧区出产的羊毛、皮革、酥油和肉类，除供应高原上人民的需要以外，每年还大量外销。每当草肥畜壮的秋季来临时，牧民们便把各种牧产品用牦牛和驮羊运到农业区去交换粮食和各种日用品。冬季里，成群的野马、野鹿、羚羊、熊、猞猁、狐狸等野兽从北方湖沼区来到高原上，牧民们便开始了狩猎生活。
    高原上还有广大的农业区。在西康西部金沙江、澜沧江、怒江两岸和波密地区的河谷地带，到处是良田。西藏中部雅鲁藏布江和拉萨河流域的冲积平原上，土地肥沃，气候温和，被称为“西藏粮仓”，这里每年出产的粮食占西藏粮食总产量的四分之一。许多寒带和热带的农作物和果类，在高原上都能生长。高原上出产的青稞和小麦，颗粒肥大，有高度的抗寒和抗旱能力，是优良的农作物品种。
    康藏高原上各种丰饶的天然富源，过去是帝国主义掠夺的目标。在这里居住的藏族人民，虽然每年辛勤劳动，仍然过着贫困的生活。自从一九五一年中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订了和平解放西藏办法的协议，中国人民解放军进驻西藏以后，在中央人民政府和进藏部队的帮助下，西藏和西康西部地区的农业、牧业、工商业和文化教育事业，都已逐渐恢复和发展起来。高原上过去没有学校和医院，现在已经设立起民族学校，各主要城镇已设立或者正准备设立医院和门诊所。中国人民银行在西藏和西康发放了无利农、牧贷款和低利手工业贷款。国营西藏贸易总公司以合理价格收购了西藏积压多年的和解放后出产的羊毛。去年康藏高原的主要农业区，获得了十年来从没有过的丰收，青稞和小麦的产量比一九五一年增加了一倍。
