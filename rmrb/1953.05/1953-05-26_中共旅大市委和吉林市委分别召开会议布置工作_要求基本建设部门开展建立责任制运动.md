    The CCP Lüda Municipal Committee and Jilin Municipal Committee Convene Meetings to Deploy Work, Demanding Capital Construction Departments Launch a Responsibility System Movement

    [By this newspaper] The CCP Lüda Municipal Committee recently convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various capital construction departments to discuss how to establish and improve the responsibility system in capital construction departments.

    The meeting pointed out that more than sixty projects have commenced in Lüda City to date, but the preparatory work for construction has not been sufficient, and various responsibility systems have not been established or are incomplete. Materials and tools for many construction sites have not been fully prepared. In order to strive for early commencement, workers are sent to the construction sites, resulting in chaos in site management. Some units have not clearly recognized the responsibilities of both parties (Party A and Party B), so many specific problems cannot be resolved in a timely manner, thus affecting the work. Due to the existence of the above problems, after construction begins, problems like low engineering quality, many rework activities, and waste due to work stoppages waiting for materials have become widespread. Taking the Dalian Institute of Technology construction site, which has done a better job in preparation, as an example, since construction began on April 8, the rework of bricklaying alone has reached more than 10,000 bricks.

    The meeting pointed out that to change this chaotic situation, it is necessary to launch a mass movement against waste and for the establishment of a responsibility system. An effective approach to this work should be for leading cadres to personally conduct systematic analysis and research on the situation of their own units, clearly recognize the key problems, so as to carry out this movement with focus, preparation, and step-by-step implementation. In addition, it is emphasized that the masses should be fully mobilized, and special attention should be paid to absorbing technical personnel and staff to make the establishment of the responsibility system a mass movement. For new construction projects and newly formed capital construction units, if they have already entered the construction site, they should start by addressing the main problems in the current construction, combined with discussions on the construction plan and inspections of the problems in construction. Units that have not yet started construction should start by inspecting the construction preparation work. In establishing the responsibility system, it is also necessary to avoid the formalistic tendency of "broad but not deep, establishing many but implementing few." All business departments should establish a clear responsibility system, so that someone is responsible for every matter. Each section should be oriented towards the construction site and centered on completing the engineering plan, clarifying the scope of business of each section and establishing various responsibility systems; it is necessary to oppose the practice of establishing responsibility systems in isolation from engineering tasks. The meeting specifically required all departments to complete this work by the end of June.

    Furthermore, the CCP Jilin Municipal Committee convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of various capital construction units on May 17 to deploy the work of establishing a responsibility system at each construction site.

    The commencement of various projects in Jilin City has been relatively late, and they are currently in the stage of digging trenches, but the phenomenon of no one being responsible at the construction site is quite serious. Therefore, the CCP Jilin Municipal Committee requires all units to start immediately to establish various responsibility systems.

    The steps to establish the responsibility system: First, leading cadres should study relevant documents, clarify their thinking, and unify their understanding. Cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League should concentrate their efforts to educate workers. The second step is to mobilize the masses to expose the phenomena of no one being responsible and waste. When exposing, it must be carried out in an organized, led, and purposeful manner, actively building up; and prevent tendencies such as boundless and negative reporting. The third step is to establish various systems. When establishing the responsibility system for the team's guarantee plan, workers should also be mobilized to discuss the plan and quotas, and the contact system between various teams and groups should also be formulated at the same time.

    中共旅大市委和吉林市委分别召开会议布置工作
    要求基本建设部门开展建立责任制运动
    【本报讯】中共旅大市委员会最近召集各基本建设部门负责干部开会，讨论基本建设部门如何建立与健全责任制的问题。
    会议指出：到目前为止，旅大市已有六十余处开工，但施工准备工作做得不够充分，各种责任制未建立或不健全，好多工地的材料工具都还没有准备充分，为了争取早日开工，就把工人派到工地，结果造成工地管理的混乱现象。某些单位因为没有明确认清甲乙双方责任，以致许多具体问题不能及时解决，因而影响了工作。由于上述问题的存在，开工之后，工程质量低劣、返工活多，停工待料等浪费现象也就普遍发生。以准备工作做得较好的大连工学院工地为例，从四月八日开工以来，光砌砖的返工就达红砖万余块。
    会议指出：要改变这种混乱情况，就必须开展一个群众性的反浪费与建立责任制运动。这一工作的有效做法，应该是领导干部亲自动手，事先对本单位的情况作系统的分析研究，明确认识关键问题所在，以便有重点、有准备、有步骤地开展这一运动。此外，强调充分发动群众，特别注意吸收技术人员和职员参加，使建立责任制形成一个群众性运动。凡新建工程与新组成的基本建设单位，目前已进入工地的，则应根据当前施工中的主要问题，结合讨论施工计划、检查施工中的问题入手；尚未动工的单位，应从检查施工准备工作入手。在建立责任制中，也必须避免“广而不深，建立的多，贯彻执行的少”的形式主义偏向。各个业务部门都应建立起明确的责任制，做到每件事情都有人负责。各科股都应以面向工地，围绕完成工程计划为中心，明确各科股的业务范围建立各项责任制度；反对脱离工程任务而孤立去建立责任制的作法。会议具体要求各部门在六月底前完成此项工作。
    又讯：中共吉林市委于五月十七日召集各基本建设单位的党、行政、工会、青年团的负责干部开会，布置在各工地建立责任制的工作。
    吉林市各工程开工较晚，目前刚处在挖地槽的阶段，但工地里无人负责现象已相当严重。因之中共吉林市委要求各单位从现在开始，立即着手建立各种责任制度。
    建立责任制的步骤：首先是领导干部学习有关文件，明确思想，统一认识。党、行政、工会、青年团的干部集中力量向工人进行教育。第二步发动群众对无人负责和浪费现象进行揭发。揭发时，须有组织、有领导、有目的地进行，积极建树；防止漫无边际，消极检举等偏向。第三步进行建立各种制度。在建立班组保证计划责任制时，同时要发动工人讨论计划、定额，各班、组之间的联系制度也要同时订出。
