Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 16th: The movement of the French people demanding that the five great powers consult and conclude a peace pact is growing stronger. According to a TASS report from Paris on the 15th, citing "l'Humanité," railway workers and workers from "Électricité de France" belonging to the General Confederation of Labour, "Workers' Force," and the "French Confederation of Christian Workers," recently held a conference in Montpellier, deciding to demand that the French government give an immediate and positive response to the World People's Peace Congress's appeal for negotiations to conclude a peace pact among the five great powers. They firmly oppose the French government's preparation to ratify the Bonn and Paris military treaties and demand the immediate withdrawal of the French expeditionary force from Indochina. The Seine Provincial Peace Committee, the Drome Department Veterans Union, student groups from Paris who belong to the Communist Party, Socialist Party, Popular Republican Movement, and independent student organizations, as well as many other mass organizations, have also passed resolutions supporting the World People's Peace Congress's appeal. The Drome Department Veterans Union in its resolution demanded "a conference of representatives of the occupying powers of Germany to resolve the German question through negotiation." The resolution also suggested that the French government "study any peace proposals, no matter who makes them, as long as they are intended to ease international tensions." The Paris student groups' resolution said: "People all over the world increasingly believe that peace negotiations are possible, peace negotiations are possible in Korea, where armistice negotiations are underway, possible in Indochina, and possible in Germany. We students should do our best to facilitate the start of peace negotiations and to ensure that peace negotiations continue."

    法国人民要求五大国协商缔结和平公约
    【新华社十六日讯】法国人民要求五大国协商缔结和平公约的运动日益壮大。据塔斯社巴黎十五日电引“人道报”消息，参加法国总工会、“工人力量”和“天主教劳动联盟”的铁路工人和“法国电力公司”的工人，最近在蒙拜利埃举行大会，决定要求法国政府对世界人民和平大会呼吁举行谈判以缔结五大国和平公约的信立即给予正面的答复。他们坚决反对法国政府准备批准波恩及巴黎军事条约，并要求立即从印度支那撤回法国的远征军。塞纳省和平委员会、多马山省退伍军人联盟、巴黎参加共产党、社会党、人民共和党的学生和无党派的学生组织的学生团体，以及许多其他群众团体也都通过决议，支持世界人民和平大会的呼吁。多马山省退伍军人联盟在它的决议中要求“召开德国的占领国家代表会议，以便用谈判方式解决德国问题”。决议并建议法国政府“研究任何一种不论是谁提出的和平建议，只要它是为了缓和国际的紧张局势”。巴黎学生团体的决议说：“全世界人民越来越认为和平谈判是可能的，和平谈判在正在举行停战谈判的朝鲜是可能的，在印度支那是可能的，在德国也是可能的，我们学生应该尽力促成和平谈判的开始，并促使和平谈判继续进行下去。”
