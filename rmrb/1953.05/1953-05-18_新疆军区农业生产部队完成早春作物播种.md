The agricultural production troops under the Xinjiang Military Region have completed the early spring crop sowing work in a timely manner. The agricultural production troops stationed in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, after thawing, started spring plowing and sowing in late February and early March, depending on the different ground temperatures in the areas where they were located. By the end of March and early April, 200,000 mu of spring wheat had been sown on schedule; more than 300,000 mu of winter wheat sown last year were also spring-harrowed, and some miscellaneous grains and beans were also sown in a timely manner.

During this year's early spring crop sowing period, the Xinjiang Military Region issued instructions on spring plowing and sowing in late February. After the start of spring plowing, the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Department of the Military Region also dispatched 52 cadres and organized six inspection teams to go to areas such as the Dihua, Yining Reclamation Area, Manas River Reclamation Area, Aksu, Yanqi, and Hami to inspect the production work of the troops. Leading cadres of various divisions and regiments also put forward specific requirements in accordance with the instructions of the Military Region and in combination with the specific conditions of their localities, and often went deep into the lower levels to conduct inspections and specific guidance. This played a significant guaranteeing role in the successful completion of the early spring sowing work.

In order to increase the yield per unit area and strive for a comprehensive harvest, the troops, in accordance with the instructions of the Military Region and in combination with the production experience of the past three years, adopted scientific cultivation methods and carried out intensive cultivation. Eighty percent of the wheat land sown this spring had been autumn-plowed and winter-irrigated last year. The soil has been fully weathered and the soil moisture is sufficient, and base fertilizer has been applied before sowing; 3,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu were applied to 520 mu of high-yield spring wheat in the "August 1st" Farm. In terms of sowing time, most of the sowing was done when the ground temperature was three to four degrees. A certain unit in Yanqi timely sowed 16,000 mu of spring wheat and spring-harrowed more than 23,000 mu of winter wheat within the appropriate sowing period; the "August 1st" Farm completed the sowing of more than 13,000 mu of spring wheat within ten days according to the plan, and all of them were densely planted by strip sowing, with a sowing amount of 18 to 20 catties per mu. Most of the seeds selected were black awn seeds or big-headed wheat seeds with high yield and good quality, and they were all subjected to seed selection, machine selection, seed disinfection, and germination tests.

During spring sowing, the troops strengthened organizational leadership, rationally organized the labor force, implemented the production quota system and the ten-hour labor system, and generally used Soviet-style horse-drawn farm tools and mechanical farm tools, which further improved the quality of cultivation and labor efficiency. During the early spring sowing period, a certain unit in Yanqi used 32 tractors to sow more than 36,000 mu of early spring crops in fifteen days. The Fourth Company of a certain unit plowed an average of 10.6 mu of land per plow per day. Kang Yuanjia of the company sowed 41.24 mu per day with a seeder; Ke Datang of a certain unit used a twelve-row seeder to sow an average of 74.31 mu per day.

During the spring sowing period, all units attached great importance to drought prevention and resistance. In order not to delay the farming season, a certain unit in Hami completed the Hongxing Second Canal, which is 75 li long and can irrigate 100,000 mu of farmland, on April 5; the Hongyanchi Reservoir, which can store 5,000 cubic meters of water, was also completed in early March; a certain unit in the Manas River Reclamation Area repaired a Toufu Canal more than 2,000 meters long in ten days, ensuring the timely irrigation of crops.

At present, most of the spring wheat has emerged, and the winter wheat is growing well after spring harrowing. Late spring crops such as cotton, rice, and corn have also begun to be sown. (News Team, Propaganda Department, Political Department of Xinjiang Military Region)

    新疆军区农业生产部队完成早春作物播种
    新疆军区所属农业生产部队，已适时完成早春作物播种工作。驻扎在天山南北的农业生产部队，于解冻以后，依据所在地区的不同的地温情况，先后于二月下旬、三月上旬开始春耕播种，到三月底四月初为止，二十万亩春小麦全部按时播完；去年播种的三十多万亩冬小麦，也都进行了春耙，部分杂粮与豆类作物也及时下了种。
    在今年早春作物播种期间，新疆军区于二月下旬即发布了关于春耕播种工作的指示。春耕开始后，军区农牧处又抽调干部五十二人，组织了六个检查组，分赴迪化、伊宁垦区、玛纳斯河垦区、阿克苏、焉耆、哈密等地区，检查部队生产工作。各师、团领导机关负责干部也根据军区指示结合本地具体情况，提出了具体要求，并经常深入下层，进行检查和具体指导。这对胜利完成早春播种工作，起了很大的保证作用。
    为了提高单位面积产量，争取全面丰收，部队根据军区指示，结合三年来的生产经验，采用科学耕作法，进行了精耕细作。今春播种的小麦地，有百分之八十都是经过去年秋耕和冬灌的，土壤已得到充分风化，地墒很足，播种前都施了基肥；“八一”农场五百二十亩丰产春麦每亩施了基肥三千斤。在播种时间上，大部分是在地温三至四度时播种的。焉耆某部在适当的播种期内，及时地播完春麦一万六千亩，并春耙冬麦二万三千多亩；“八一”农场按计划在十天内播完一万三千多亩春麦，而且都是用条播的方式进行密植，播种量每亩十八至二十斤。大部分籽种选用的是产量高、质量好的黑芒种或大头麦种，并经过精选、机选和籽种消毒、发芽试验等。
    春播中，部队加强了组织领导，合理组织了劳动力，实行了生产定额制和十小时劳动制度，并且普遍使用了苏式马拉农具和机械农具，使耕作质量和劳动效率进一步提高了。焉耆某部在早春播种期间，以三十二台拖拉机，在十五天内播完三万六千多亩早春作物。某部四连平均每张犁每天犁地十亩六分，该连亢元甲用摆耧日播四十一点二四亩；某部柯大堂使用十二行播种机平均日播七十四点三一亩。
    春播期间，各单位对防旱抗旱工作都非常重视。哈密某部为了不误农时，及时放水，于四月五日提前完成长达七十五华里，可灌农田十万亩地的红星二渠；蓄水五千立方的红雁池蓄水库也在三月初全部竣工；玛纳斯河垦区某部在十天内整修了一条长二千多公尺的头浮渠，保证了作物的及时灌溉。
    现在，春麦大部分已出苗，冬麦经过春耙生长得很好。棉花、水稻、包谷等晚春作物，也开始了播种。（新疆军区政治部宣传部新闻组）
