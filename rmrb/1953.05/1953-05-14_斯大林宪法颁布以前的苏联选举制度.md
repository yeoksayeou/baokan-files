The Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and Local People's Congresses at All Levels has been promulgated. Our Election Law, in its drafting process, has absorbed the advanced experience of Soviet elections, especially the experience of the Soviet electoral system before the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution in 1936. A brief introduction to the electoral system of the Soviet state at that time may be helpful in understanding the spirit and direction of development of our current electoral system.

The Soviet electoral system before 1936, although not as perfect as the later electoral system, already showed its true socialist democratic essence.

The great October Socialist Revolution overthrew the reactionary state power of the landlords and capitalists, and victoriously established a new type of Soviet regime of the proletarian dictatorship on one-sixth of the world's land, implementing the public ownership of the means of production. This provided the Russian working class and all laborers with the political premise and material conditions for enjoying various democratic rights, including the right to vote. In the early years of the Soviet regime, due to the fact that the overthrown exploiting classes still retained considerable power, they were constantly plotting to overthrow the young Soviet regime under the instigation and support of foreign imperialism; and due to the fact that the dominant small-peasant economy left over by Tsarist Russia had not been able to embark on the road of socialist collective economy immediately, and the power and influence of the rich peasants in the countryside remained very large until before 1929, the Soviet regime's then and subsequent decrees and constitutions showed some characteristics in regulating citizens' rights, especially the right to vote.

The constitutions of the Soviet state during this period stipulated a formally non-thoroughly universal, but truly universal for laborers, right to vote. All laborers who had reached the age of eighteen on the day of the election, except those sentenced to imprisonment for corruption and other crimes, or those who were mentally ill or insane, or under guardianship, enjoyed the right to elect and be elected to all levels of Soviets. All qualifications restrictions on belief, gender, nationality and race, property status, education level, length of residence, etc., which are still widely used in capitalist countries, were abolished. Adapting to the main function of the Soviet state during the above-mentioned period—suppressing the resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes—the Soviet regime set some restrictions on the right to vote; that is, depriving the following types of people of the right to elect and be elected: 1. those who employ hired laborers for the purpose of seeking profit; 2. those who live on non-labor income such as interest on capital, interest on enterprises, and property income; 3. private merchants, traders, and commercial intermediaries; 4. clergy and religious priests; 5. staff and agents of the old police agencies, gendarmerie special corps, and security bureaus, as well as the old Russian royal family. The Soviet regime's adoption of this most resolute class policy was absolutely necessary and correct under the historical conditions at that time. As the historical decree "Declaration of Rights of the Exploited and Laboring People," personally drafted by Lenin and Stalin in January 1918, pointed out: "At the crucial moment when the people are fighting the final battle against the exploiters, there must be no room for the exploiters to intervene in any organ of power." The 1918 Soviet Russian Constitution and the constitutions of other brotherly Soviet republics openly represented the will of the victorious working class and all laborers, and declared the deprivation of the right to elect and be elected from all exploiting classes such as industrial and commercial capitalists, landlords, rich peasants, and their servants. As Comrade Stalin said, this "is the Soviet regime's response to their rebellious actions." (Problems of Leninism, 1949, Moscow Edition, Chinese text, p. 699) This group of people deprived of the right to vote only accounted for two to three percent of the total population at that time, while the laborers, accounting for ninety-seven to ninety-eight percent of the national population, truly enjoyed the guaranteed right to elect and be elected. The measures taken by the Soviet regime clearly demonstrated the true popular nature of the Soviet regime. As Lenin said in his famous book "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky": "Since, after one year of 'practical work' by the Soviets, the Soviets have deprived the exploiters of their right to vote, it means that these Soviets are not organizations of social-imperialists and social-pacifists who sell themselves to the bourgeoisie, but truly organizations of the oppressed masses. Since these Soviets deprive the exploiters of their right to vote, it means that the Soviets are not petty-bourgeois organs that compromise with the capitalists, not organs for parliamentary rhetoric (like the rhetoric of the Kautskys, the Longuets, and the MacDonalds), but truly revolutionary proletarian organs that fight a life-and-death struggle with the exploiters."
(Selected Works of Lenin in Two Volumes, Vol. 2, Chinese text, pp. 473-474)

The constitutions of the Soviet state during this period stipulated the superior electoral right of the working class over the peasants. That is to say, the right to vote was not completely equal, manifested in: the number of Soviet representatives in urban and rural areas was different, the number of urban representatives was calculated according to the number of voters, while the number of representatives in rural areas was calculated according to the number of residents. To nominate one representative to the Soviet Congress in the rural areas, it was necessary to elect him from a mass of residents three times larger than the number of urban residents. For example, for representatives to the All-Union and All-Russian Soviet Congresses, cities and city-villages elected one representative for every 25,000 voters, while the state (former province) Soviet Congresses required one representative for every 125,000 residents. This superior position of the workers, as Comrade Molotov said, "was implemented when the peasants were still completely small producers (small private owners), and when the power of the rich peasants in the countryside was still very large. This superior position consolidated the leading role of the working class in the Soviet state, helped to consolidate the Soviet regime, and also guaranteed the extensive assistance of the proletarian dictatorship to the working peasants in the development of rural economy and the subsequent socialist transformation of the countryside. The Party has long pointed out that, in order to safeguard the achievements of the proletarian revolution, this superior position of the workers was necessary at that time, but at the same time it must be emphasized its temporary nature." (Molotov: "On the Revision of the Soviet Constitution") The Soviet state's then provision of the workers' superior right to vote over the peasants was obviously completely determined by the specific historical conditions at that time. When socialism later achieved complete victory not only in industry but also in agriculture, this provision lost its necessity for existence and was replaced by completely equal voting rights.

During this period, only grassroots organs of power—urban, urban district, and village Soviets—implemented direct elections, that is, representatives were directly elected by voters convening electoral meetings. Intermediate and higher organs of power—district, state, province, up to the National Soviet Congress—were generated by the method of dispatching representatives from the corresponding lower-level organs of power, that is, implementing multi-level elections (indirect elections). This multi-level electoral system, under the conditions of sharp class struggle at that time, could prevent anti-Soviet regime hostile elements from infiltrating into the higher-level state organs of power, ensuring that the highest organs of power and local organs of power obtained rapid improvement, making all organs of power more flexible, thus greatly purifying and strengthening the Soviet regime. As early as 1918, Lenin pointed out: "The adoption of non-direct elections for non-local Soviets makes it easier to hold Soviet congresses, makes all organs cheaper and more flexible, and makes them closer to the workers and peasants in times of intense life and need, when they can quickly recall their local representatives or send them to participate in the National Soviet Congress." (See "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky")

Regarding the voting method during elections, the constitutions of this period did not explicitly stipulate, but in practice, the open voting method was usually adopted. This method was stipulated by many election-related decrees at that time. For example, Article 41 of the "Instructions on the Election Procedures for Municipal and Village Soviets and the Convening Procedures for Soviet Congresses" issued by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on November 21, 1925, stipulated: Elections shall be held by open voting. (See Compilation of Constitutional and Electoral Law Materials, Volume 1, edited and printed by the General Office of the Central People's Government Committee, p. 81) The adoption of this method was mainly because in the early years of the Soviet regime, the cultural backwardness left over from the past Tsarist Russia had not been eliminated immediately, and many of the broad masses of laborers were still illiterate. The adoption of open voting—raising hands to vote—greatly facilitated the real masters of the Soviet regime in exercising their right to vote.

In addition, the Soviet state's elections during this period implemented the principle of production area. That is to say, the majority of members of urban Soviets and the majority of representatives to Soviet congresses were elected by enterprises, institutions, and various social organizations of laborers (such as trade unions, etc.). For citizens who do not work in enterprises or have not joined trade unions, such as family handicraft workers, handicraftsmen, housewives, cart drivers, etc., electoral meetings are held according to district units (according to districts, sections, etc.). As for the elections to the Soviets, they are held according to individual villages. (Refer to the aforementioned Instructions on the Election of Municipal and Village Soviets issued by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on November 21, 1925, ibid., pp. 80-81)

It must be pointed out that from the very first day of the Soviet regime's existence, the democratic principle of the mutual relationship between representatives and voters, which all bourgeois countries have not and cannot achieve to this day, has been realized, that is, representatives must be responsible to the voters and the voters enjoy the right to recall representatives they do not trust in advance. The historical decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on the Right to Recall Representatives, personally drafted by Lenin on December 4 (November 21), 1917, openly declared: "Only under the condition of recognizing and using the right of voters to recall their representatives, can any electoral organ and congress be considered truly democratic and truly representative of the people's will." The realization of this principle even more clearly demonstrated the inherent true democratic nature of the Soviet state's electoral system and its incomparable superiority over the electoral system of any bourgeois country.

Such were the characteristics of the electoral system of the Soviet state during this period. Although it was still a non-thoroughly universal, not completely equal, multi-level, and open voting election, it was already the most democratic electoral system in the world in practice at that time. It was because of this completely practical democratic electoral system that the working class and all laborers of the Soviet state had the actual possibility of exercising state power and learning to manage the country. It was also because of the deprivation of the overthrown exploiters of the right to vote and the existence of certain other differences that the Soviet regime effectively safeguarded the interests of the laborers, ensured the victorious advancement of socialist construction under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard—the Leninist-Stalinist Party, and built a socialist society.

With the complete victory of socialism, the Soviet state completely eliminated the exploiting classes, and Soviet society is now entirely composed of the laboring classes—the working class, the peasant class, and the Soviet intellectuals. This has given the Soviet state the full possibility of making its electoral system completely democratic, "transitioning from limited elections to universal elections, from not completely equal elections to equal elections, from multi-level elections to direct elections, from open voting elections to secret voting elections." (History of the CPSU (B), Moscow Chinese text, p. 425) The new Soviet Constitution—the Stalin Constitution—passed in 1936, is the most democratic constitution in the world. All 146 articles from beginning to end are permeated with firm and thorough socialist democracy.

The historical path of development of the Soviet state's electoral system is a victorious path of continuous growth and development of socialist democracy. The great principles of the Stalin Constitution, which fixed the most democratic electoral system, have also become the guide for our country's state power construction.

    斯大林宪法颁布以前的苏联选举制度
    王向明
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法颁布了。我们的选举法在其制定过程中，曾经吸取了苏联选举的先进经验，尤其是在一九三六年斯大林宪法颁布以前苏联选举制度的经验。现在把当时苏维埃国家的选举制度简单介绍一下，对于帮助我们了解我国目前选举制度的精神实质和发展的方向，可能有所补益。
    一九三六年以前苏联的选举制度，虽然还没有后来的选举制度那样完善，但已经显示出它的真正的社会主义民主主义底本质。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命推翻了地主资本家反动的国家政权，在世界六分之一的土地上胜利地建立起来了工人阶级专政的新型的苏维埃政权，实行了生产资料公有制，这就为俄国工人阶级和一切劳动者提供了享受包括选举权在内的各种民主权利的政治前提和物质条件。在苏维埃政权存在的最初年代里，由于被推翻了的剥削阶级还依然保存着相当的势力，它们在外国帝国主义指使和支持之下，时刻在阴谋推翻年轻的苏维埃政权；由于沙俄遗留下来的占优势的小农经济还未能立刻走上社会主义集体经济的道路，而富农在农村中的势力和影响一直到一九二九年以前还仍然很大，所以苏维埃政权当时的以及往后的若干法令和宪法，便在规定公民的权利、特别是选举权利这一问题上，表现出若干特点。
    苏维埃国家在这一时期的宪法，规定了在形式上非彻底普遍、但对于劳动者却是真正普遍的选举权。凡在选举日前已满十八岁的全体劳动者，除因贪污及其他罪行被判处徒刑者或有精神病或心神丧失者和受监护者外，都享有各级苏维埃的选举权及被选举权。一切在资本主义国家至今广泛采用的对于信仰、性别、民族和种族、财产状况、教育程度、居住期限等等资格限制，都一概取消了。适应着上述时期苏维埃国家的主要职能——镇压被推翻了的剥削阶级反抗的职能，苏维埃政权在选举权上设了一些限制；这就是剥夺以下各种人的选举权与被选举权：一、以谋取利润为目的而采用雇佣劳动者；二、依靠非劳动之收入如资金生息、企业生息、财产收入等为生者；三、私商、贸易及商业中间人；四、僧侣及宗教祭司；五、旧警察机构、宪兵特别团及保安所的职员与代理人，以及旧俄皇族。苏维埃政权采取这种最坚决的阶级政策，在当时的历史条件下是十分必要而正确的。正如一九一八年一月由列宁、斯大林亲自起草的“被剥削劳动人民权利宣言”这一历史性的法令所指出：“当人民与剥削者作最后斗争的关头，在任何一个政权机关中都决不能有剥削者插足的余地。”一九一八年苏俄宪法以及其他兄弟苏维埃共和国宪法，公开地代表着胜利了的工人阶级和全体劳动者的意志，宣布剥夺工商业资本家、地主、富农等一切剥削阶级及为他们服务的仆从们的选举权与被选举权。正如斯大林同志所说，这“是苏维埃政权对于他们这种反抗行动的回答。”（列宁主义问题，一九四九年，莫斯科版，中文本，第六九九页）这种被剥夺选举权利的人，只占当时居民总数的百分之二到三，而占全国人口百分之九七到九八的劳动者，则真正享受到了有保障的选举权与被选举权。苏维埃政权所采取的这种措施，十分明显地表现出了苏维埃政权的真正人民性。正如列宁在他的名著“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”一书中所说：“既然在苏维埃一年的‘实际工作’之后，剥削者底选举权被苏维埃所剥夺了，那就是说，这些苏维埃不是卖身于资产阶级的社会帝国主义者与社会和平主义者底组织，而是真正被压迫群众底组织。既然这些苏维埃剥夺了剥削者底选举权，那就是说，苏维埃不是同资本家妥协的小资产阶级底机关，不是作国会空谈（如考茨基辈，龙格辈和麦克唐纳辈之空谈）的机关，而是同剥削者作殊死斗争的真正革命无产阶级底机关。”
    （列宁文选两卷集，第二卷，中文本，第四七三——四七四页）
    这一时期的苏维埃国家的宪法，规定了工人阶级较农民为优越的选举权。这就是说，选举权还不完全平等，表现在：城市与乡村的苏维埃代表名额不同，城市代表名额是按照选民人数来计算，而乡村地区代表名额则是按照居民人数来计算。在乡村地区提出参加本届苏维埃代表大会代表一人，须从多于城市居民人数三倍数额的居民群众中才能选出。比如，全联盟和全俄苏维埃代表大会的代表，城市和市村苏维埃每二万五千选民选一名，而州（旧省）苏维埃代表大会则须每十二万五千居民才能选出一名。工人方面的这种优越地位，正如莫洛托夫同志所说，“是当着农民还完全是小生产者（小私有者），并且富农在乡村中的势力还是很大的时候，被实行了的。这种优越地位巩固了工人阶级在苏维埃国家中的领导作用，帮助了苏维埃政权的巩固，同时也保证了无产阶级专政在发展农村经济上以及随后在农村的社会主义改造上，对于劳动农民的广泛援助。党早就指出，为了保障无产阶级革命的成果，工人方面这种优越地位在当时是必要的，但同时又必须强调它的临时性质。”（莫洛托夫：“关于苏维埃宪法的修改”）苏维埃国家当时对于工人在选举上较农民为优越的这种规定，很显然完全决定于当时的具体历史条件。等到后来社会主义不仅在工业中而且也在农业中取得了完全胜利，这种规定就失去其存在的必要，而为完全平等的选举权所代替了。
    在这一时期，只有基层政权机关——城市、市辖区和村苏维埃实行直接选举，即由选民召开选举大会直接选举代表。各中级和高级政权机关——区、州、省，直到全国的苏维埃代表大会，则是由相当的下级政权单位派遣代表的方法产生，也就是实行多级选举（间接选举）。这种多级选举制度，在当时尖锐的阶级斗争条件下，可以防止反苏维埃政权的敌对分子钻进国家高级政权机关，保证了最高政权机关与地方政权机关获得迅速的改进，使得所有政权机关更加灵活，这样也就大大纯化了并加强了苏维埃政权。列宁早在一九一八年就曾指出：“对于非地方性的苏维埃采用非直接的选举制，就使苏维埃代表大会易于举行，使全部机关更加便宜和更加灵活，使其在生活紧张与需要能急速召回自己地方代表或派遣他们去参加全国苏维埃代表大会的时期，更加接近工农。”（见“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”）
    关于选举时的投票方式，这一时期的宪法并未明文规定，但在实践中通常都是采用公开投票方式。这种方式曾为当时很多有关选举的法令加以规定。比如一九二五年十一月二十一日全俄中央执行委员会“关于市、村苏维埃选举程序及苏维埃代表大会召开程序的指示”第四十一条就曾规定：选举依公开投票的方法来举行。（见宪法及选举法资料汇编第一册，中央人民政府委员会办公厅编印本，第八一页）这种方式的采用，主要是由于苏维埃政权存在的最初年代里，过去沙俄遗留下来的文化落后状态还未能立刻加以消除，广大的劳动群众很多都还不识字，采用公开的投票—举手表决的办法，也就大大便利了苏维埃政权的真正主人行使自己的选举权利。
    除此以外，苏维埃国家在这一时期的选举是实行生产区域原则。这就是说，城市苏维埃的多数成员和苏维埃代表大会的大部分代表，是按企业、机关、劳动者的各种社会组织（如职工会等）来选举的。对于不在企业里工作或未加入职工会的公民，如家庭手工业者、手工业者、家庭主妇、赶车的等等，选举大会则依地区单位（依区、段等）来举行。至于对苏维埃的选举，是按个别村庄来举行。（参照前举一九二五年十一月二十一日全俄中央执行委员会关于市、村苏维埃选举的指示，同上书，第八○——八一页）
    必须指出，从苏维埃政权存在的最初一天起，就已经实现了迄今一切资产阶级国家所没有而且也不可能实现的代表与选民之间相互关系的民主原则，即代表必须对选民负责以及选民对自己不信任的代表享有先期召回的权利，一九一七年十二月四日（十一月二十一日）由列宁亲自起草的全俄中央执行委员会关于罢免代表权的历史性法令公开地宣称：“只有在承认与使用选民召回其代表权利的条件下，任何选举机关和代表大会才可被认为是真正民主的和真正代表人民意志的。”这一原则的实现，也就更加明显地表现出了苏维埃国家选举制度所固有的真正民主性及其对于任何资产阶级国家选举制度无比的优越性。
    苏维埃国家这一时期选举制度的特点，就是如此。尽管还是非彻底普遍的、不完全平等的、多级的、公开投票的选举，而在当时实际上就已经是世界上最民主的选举制度了。由于这种完全切合实际的民主选举制度，苏维埃国家的工人阶级和一切劳动者才有了行使政权，学会管理国家的本领的实际可能，也正是由于在选举权上对于已被推翻的剥削者实行了剥夺以及某些其他差别的存在，苏维埃政权才有效地维护了劳动者的利益，保证了在工人阶级及其先锋队——列宁斯大林党的领导之下，胜利地推进了社会主义建设，并建成了社会主义社会。
    随着社会主义的完全胜利，苏维埃国家彻底消灭了剥削阶级，苏维埃社会已完全是由劳动者阶级——工人阶级、农民阶级和苏维埃知识分子所构成，这就使苏维埃国家有了充分的可能来使自己的选举制度完全民主化，“从有限制的选举过渡到普遍的选举，从不完全平等的选举过渡到平等的选举，从多级的选举过渡到直接的选举，从公开投票的选举过渡到秘密投票的选举。”“联共（布）党史，莫斯科中文本，第四二五页）一九三六年所通过的新的苏联宪法——斯大林宪法，是世界上最民主的宪法，从头到尾的一四六条都浸透了坚定的、彻底的社会主义民主主义。
    苏维埃国家选举制度发展的历史道路，是一条社会主义民主主义不断成长和发展的胜利道路。固定了最民主的选举制度的斯大林宪法的伟大原则，也成了我们国家政权建设的指针。
