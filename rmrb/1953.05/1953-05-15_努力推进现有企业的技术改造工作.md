    Strive to Promote Technological Transformation of Existing Enterprises
    Since July of last year, the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has launched a mass movement for mechanization and automation, carrying out a series of transformations of the old production equipment. As a result of this movement, the level of mechanization of the entire factory has been greatly improved, the imbalance of equipment has been overcome, the physical labor of workers has been reduced, labor conditions have been improved, and the labor productivity of the entire factory has increased by 41.5 percent. The creative labor of the workers in the small rolling mill has driven the mass technical reform movement in other departments of Anshan Iron and Steel. As of April this year, according to a survey of only 22 units, the workers have put forward 1,144 suggestions on mechanization and automation, of which 167 have been approved after review and have been successfully tested. The face of many production departments of Anshan Iron and Steel has been greatly changed in this movement. This experience is very valuable and of great significance to our country's new economic construction, especially to the transformation of old factories and mines and the improvement of their technical level. It proves that relying on the creativity of the masses to gradually and systematically carry out the technical transformation of old enterprises to make them mechanized and automated is completely necessary and possible.
    Implementing mechanization and automation to reduce physical labor and increase labor productivity is one of our major goals in industrial construction. In order to achieve this goal, we must do a lot of work. On the one hand, we must strive to accumulate funds, increase equipment, and build new factories and expand existing factories; on the other hand, we must actively carry out technical transformation of existing enterprises and transform the old equipment of existing enterprises with low technical levels into mechanized or automated devices. Because only when the production process is mechanized and automated can we change backward operating methods, improve the level of existing industry, increase production, and promote the development of the national economy. As pointed out in the resolution of the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Implementation of the Five-Year Plan for Industry": "Making the fullest use of existing industrial equipment which has not yet been fully utilized and adopting new technologies are important reserves for further promoting and accelerating socialist development." The Soviet Union has attached great importance to the transformation of existing enterprises in the economic construction of successive five-year plans. In the instructions of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it was also emphasized: "In addition to putting new enterprises and machinery into operation, it is also necessary to transform existing enterprises, add new equipment, implement production mechanization, increase production speed, and improve technical operation processes to ensure increased production capacity of existing enterprises. The expansion of existing enterprises is the most important potential for increasing production with the least expenditure." These experiences of the Soviet Union are equally applicable to our country's industrial construction today.
    Transforming existing enterprise equipment is a particularly important task for our country's current economic construction. Because from the perspective of our country's current economic situation, industry is still extremely underdeveloped, and the level of production and technology is very backward. To change this backward state, we must arm our existing enterprises with new technologies, and we must not relax the technical transformation of existing enterprises while building new modern factories. Our existing enterprises are all old enterprises taken over from the enemy and puppets. In the past, these enterprises were semi-colonial in nature, and their characteristics were very backward technical level, extremely unbalanced machinery and equipment, and very unsafe operating conditions. This situation, on the one hand, makes it impossible to improve labor efficiency, and on the other hand, many equipment cannot give full play to its effectiveness. For example, in some mechanical factories, the disparity in the production capacity of machines is as high as one to two hundred and forty. That is to say, when producing parts for the same product, one type of part can be produced one, while another type of part can be produced two hundred and forty; that is to say, the machine that produces the former product operates for two hundred and forty days, while the machine that produces the latter product only needs to operate for one day, and the rest of the time is rarely used or not used at all. This situation further illustrates that we must quickly change the production status of existing enterprises, and it also shows that existing enterprises still have great potential, making it possible for us to carry out transformation. The fact that the labor production efficiency of the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has rapidly increased by 41.5 percent after the implementation of mechanization and automation is a very powerful proof.
    However, not all enterprise management cadres have realized the important significance of transforming existing enterprises. Some people believe that the equipment of existing enterprises is too old, and it is better to rebuild new ones than to transform old ones; some people believe that transforming old equipment to make it mechanized and automated is a profound and unattainable fantasy. It is precisely these harmful views that make many of our enterprise leaders wait for the start of construction of new factories and neglect the transformation of existing enterprises. Even if they admit that existing enterprises should be transformed, they only ask the state to invest heavily and replace new equipment, but do not actively transform existing equipment. Obviously, these views and practices are very wrong. People who hold these views neither understand that continuously improving existing enterprises with the latest technology and giving full play to their capabilities is an "important reserve force" for developing the national economy and one of our basic policies; nor do they understand that it often takes a long time for new factories to go from starting construction to starting production, and that all industrial products currently needed by the people and most of the equipment and materials needed for national basic construction still have to be produced by existing enterprises. If we ignore the transformation of existing enterprises, it will inevitably cause significant losses to our country's economic construction, which is absolutely not allowed. We must see that the technical transformation and production improvement of existing enterprises are directly related to the development speed of national economic construction and a major issue directly related to the leading role of the working class in the country. This is also as pointed out in the resolution of the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "The results of new construction, that is, the cheap and high-quality products produced by new factories, must take a considerable amount of time (usually several years) before they can enter the market." And "Rational and planned utilization of all existing forces in the national economy can ensure maintaining a fairly high rate of development of the national economy, increasing the state-owned part of the national economy year by year, and consolidating and strengthening the leadership role of the proletariat in our country." (On the economic situation and tasks of the Party)
    We must learn from the experience of Soviet economic construction. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has set an example in learning from Soviet experience in building new factories and transforming old factories. The example of the mass mechanization and automation movement in the small rolling mill has also provided us with a good example. The entire technical transformation work of the small rolling mill used limited funds (of which the most important transformation - the creation of the light rolling reversing disc, only cost three million yuan), and the increase in the factory's productivity created 260.4 billion yuan of wealth in the increase production and conservation movement in 1952 alone. This proves that this transformation is "the most important potential for increasing production with the least expenditure." The experience of the small rolling mill convincingly proves the practical possibility of transforming the technology of existing enterprises. They launched a mass movement of major technological reform in a planned and organized manner in accordance with technical principles; the main leading cadres worked hard to study their business, grasped the key to technical management, implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, and relied on the collective creative spirit of the masses. These are the decisive factors for their success. It is particularly worth noting that the leading cadres of the small rolling mill do not have any special conditions compared to the leading cadres of general factories and mines. The cadres of the trade union and the Communist Youth League were also promoted from the workers of the factory, and they did not have any special skills. However, because their work attitude is honest, "ask experts about things they don't understand, and rely on workers to solve difficulties." Therefore, they can timely discover and grasp the key issues in the work, and strictly follow the requirements of completing the production plan and the principle of balanced production to inspire the creativity of the masses. They can promptly give support and specific guidance to the rationalization proposals put forward by the masses, which not only solves the difficulties in the work, but also improves the level of the cadres themselves. This method of leadership is also worth learning.
    The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill in transforming existing equipment to make it mechanized and automated should be widely promoted nationwide. All industrial departments should notify the experience of the small rolling mill to each administration bureau and each enterprise, and strive to promote the technical transformation of existing enterprises. Cadres leading enterprises must consider and study specific methods for transforming existing equipment based on the specific conditions of their enterprises, and lead and organize the masses of workers to put forward rationalization proposals in a planned manner, and strive to further improve the technical level and labor productivity of our industrial production.

    努力推进现有企业的技术改造工作
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂从去年七月以来发动了一个群众性的机械化、自动化运动，对旧有的生产设备进行了一系列的改造。这个运动的结果，大大地提高了全厂机械化的水平，克服了设备不平衡的状态，减轻了职工的体力劳动，改善了劳动条件，使全厂劳动生产率提高百分之四十一点五。小型轧钢厂职工们的创造性的劳动，带动了鞍钢其他部门的群众性的技术改革运动。到今年四月为止，仅据二十二个单位的调查，工人群众已经提出了一千一百四十四件关于机械化、自动化的建议，经过审查批准并已试验成功的有一百六十七件。鞍钢的许多生产部门的面貌，在这个运动中已经有了很大的改观。这个经验，对于我国新的经济建设事业，特别是对于旧有厂矿的改造及其技术水平的提高是十分宝贵和具有重大意义的。它证明了依靠群众的创造性，逐步地有计划地进行旧企业的技术改造，使之机械化、自动化，是完全必要和可能的。
    实行机械化、自动化以减轻体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，这是我们在工业建设方面的重大努力目标之一。为了达到这个目的，我们要作很多的工作，一方面要努力积累资金、增加设备，建立新的工厂和扩充现有工厂；一方面更要积极地进行对现有企业的技术改造，将技术水平较低的现有企业的旧设备改造为机械化或自动化的装置。因为只有生产过程机械化、自动化了，才可以改变落后的操作方法，提高现有工业的水平，增加生产，促进国民经济的发展。正如联共第十六次代表大会“关于工业五年计划的执行”的决议中所指出的：“尽量利用尚未充分加以利用的现有工业装备和采用新技术，是进一步推动和加速社会主义发展的重要后备力量。”苏联在历次五年计划的经济建设中，都十分重视对现有企业的改造。在联共第十九次代表大会对第五个五年计划的指示里，还强调地指出：“除了使新的企业和机器设备运转起来外，还要改造现有企业、增添新设备、实行生产机械化、提高生产速度和改进技术操作过程，以保证增加现有企业的生产能力。现有企业的扩大，是以最少开支而使生产增加的最重要的潜力。”苏联的这些经验，对于今天我国的工业建设是同样适用的。
    改造现有企业设备对我国目前的经济建设事业来说，是特别重要的一项任务。因为从我国现实的经济情况来看，工业还极不发达，生产和技术水平都十分落后。要改变这种落后的状态，就必须用新的技术来武装我们现有的企业，就必须在建立新的现代化的工厂的同时，丝毫也不放松对现有企业的技术改造。我们现有的企业，都是从敌伪手中接收过来的旧企业。过去，这些企业是半殖民地性质的企业，它的特点是技术水平十分落后，机器设备极不平衡，作业条件很不安全。这种情况，一方面使得劳动效率不能提高，另一方面，很多设备又不能充分发挥效能。例如有的机械工厂，机器生产能力的悬殊，竟达一比二百四十。这就是说，生产同一产品的部件时，某种部件生产一个，而另一种部件就可以生产二百四十个；也就是说，生产前一种产品的机器开工二百四十天，而生产后一种产品的机器只要开工一天，其余时间就很少利用或根本没有利用。这种情况，更说明了我们必须迅速地改变现有企业的生产状况，也说明了现有企业还具有巨大的潜力，使我们可能去进行改造。鞍钢小型轧钢厂实行机械化、自动化以后，劳动生产效率迅速提高了百分之四十一点五，就是一个极其有力的证明。
    但是，我们所有企业管理干部并不是都已经认识了改造现有企业的重要意义。有一些人认为现有企业的设备太陈旧了，改造旧的不如重建新的；有一些人认为改造旧的设备使之机械化、自动化，乃是一种高深莫测、远不可及的幻想。正是这些有害的观点，使得我们的许多企业领导干部坐待新建工厂的开工，而忽视了对于现有企业的改造。他们即使承认要改造现有企业，但也只要求国家大量投资，更换新式设备，而不积极地去改造现有设备。很显然的，这些看法和作法都是十分错误的。存在这些观点的人，他们既不了解不断地用最新的技术改进现有企业，充分发挥它们的能力，乃是发展国民经济的“重要后备力量”，乃是我们的基本政策之一；他们也不了解新的工厂从开始建设到开始生产，往往需要很长的时间，而目前人民所必需的全部工业产品和国家基本建设所必需的大部分设备和材料，则仍然要靠现有的企业来生产。如果我们忽视了现有企业的改造，就一定会使我们国家的经济建设遭受重大的损失，这是决不能容许的。我们必须看到现有企业的技术改造和生产的提高，是直接关系着国家经济建设发展速度的，是直接关系着工人阶级在国家中的领导作用的一个重大问题。这也正如联共第十五次代表大会的决议中所指出的：“新建设的成果，亦即新工厂所出产之价廉物美的产品，都必须经过相当长的时间（通常是经过数年），才能进入市场。”而“合理地、有计划地利用国民经济中现有的一切力量，就可以保证保持相当高的国民经济发展速度，使国民经济中的国营部分逐年增加，并巩固与加强无产阶级在我国的领导作用。”（关于我国经济状况和党的任务）
    我们要学习苏联经济建设的经验。鞍山钢铁公司在建设新的工厂和改造旧的工厂中做出了学习苏联经验的榜样。小型轧钢厂群众性机械化、自动化运动的实例，又给我们提供了一个良好的榜样。小型轧钢厂的全部技术改造工作所用经费有限，（其中最重要的一项改造——光轧反围盘的创制，只费了三百万元），而全厂生产率的提高，只在一九五二年的增产节约运动中，就创造了二千六百零四亿元的财富。这证明这种改造是“以最少开支而使生产增加的最重要的潜力”。小型轧钢厂的经验，令人信服地证明了改造现有企业技术的实际可能性。他们按照技术原则，有计划、有组织地开展一个重大的技术改革的群众运动；主要的领导干部努力钻研业务，抓住技术管理的关键，贯彻实现苏联专家的建议，依靠群众的集体创造精神。这些就是他们成功的决定性因素。特别值得注意的是，小型轧钢厂的领导干部，比之一般厂矿的领导干部并没有什么特殊条件。工会和青年团的干部，也都是从本厂工人中提拔起来的，他们也并没有什么特殊的本领。但是由于他们工作态度老实，“不懂的事就问专家，有困难就依靠工人解决。”因此，他们就能够及时发现和掌握工作中的关键性问题，严格地按照完成生产计划的要求和平衡生产的原则，启发群众的创造性。对于群众提出的合理化建议，他们能够及时地给予支持和具体指导，这就不但解决了工作中的困难，而且提高了干部自己的水平。这种领导工作的方法，也是值得大家学习的。
    鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂改造现有设备使之机械化、自动化的经验，应该在全国范围内普遍推行。各个工业部门都应该将小型轧钢厂的经验通知各管理局和各个企业，努力推进现有企业的技术改造工作。领导企业的干部必须根据本企业的具体情况，考虑并研究改造现有设备的具体方法，有领导地组织职工群众有计划地提出合理化建议，为进一步提高我们工业生产的技术水平和劳动生产率而奋斗。
