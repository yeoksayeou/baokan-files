Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, May 9th: According to sources from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army, in order to combat the French army's conspiracy to consolidate its position in the plains, has recently launched active attacks on the North and Central Vietnamese battlefields. In the forty days up to April 25th, it annihilated more than 5,000 French troops.

    In the Northwest region, the French army, since its defeat south of An Châu in early April, has been forced to retreat from An Châu and Co Rui back to Na San.

    In the North Vietnamese plains, the enemy, in order to consolidate its position in the plains, launched offensives against the An Mo and Nga Son areas, but suffered heavy losses, with approximately 400 killed or wounded.

    At the same time, the People's Army units intensified their activities in the enemy's rear areas in North Vietnam, removing twelve enemy strongholds, including Duc Khe and Van Tru in Ha Nam Province, Quynh Lang in Thai Binh Province, Thinh Van in Hai Duong Province, Mai Khe in Vinh Phuc Province, and Trung Hoa in Quang Yen Province. The People's Army carried out nineteen ambushes, including one in the Van Tru area where an enemy company was annihilated, and another in the Tho Kieu area of Hung Yen Province where approximately one enemy company was annihilated. The People's Army units launched six large-scale raids on enemy strongholds, including one in An Nhan, Ha Nam Province, where two enemy companies were annihilated; and another in Kien An city where three enemy companies were annihilated, ten tanks, three hundred motorcycles and several artillery pieces were destroyed, and three thousand tons of ammunition and approximately 50,000 liters of gasoline were burned.

    In Central Vietnam, the People's Army removed many enemy strongholds and raided Phan Thiet city, killing or wounding sixty French officers and non-commissioned officers. On March 17th, in a counter-"sweep" battle in the Quang Binh-Quang Tri-Thua Thien area, the People's Army annihilated an enemy company.

    In total, in the forty days of combat up to April 25th, the People's Army killed 3,103 enemy troops and captured 2,021 enemy troops on the North and Central Vietnamese battlefields. Among the enemy troops annihilated were one major, fourteen captains, ten lieutenants, four second lieutenants, and fifty-five sergeants. The People's Army seized 714 rifles, 265 submachine guns, 90 machine guns, 21 heavy machine guns, 12 mortars, 5 trucks, 75 tons of ammunition, 40,000 liters of gasoline, 3 material warehouses, 85,000 meters of electrical wire, and a large quantity of medicine. 358 vehicles and 8 artillery pieces were destroyed, and 50,000 liters of gasoline, 3,000 tons of ammunition, and a power plant were burned.
