　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 4th. A rally of approximately ten thousand New York citizens was held at the Randall's Island Stadium in New York on the 3rd to "Save the Rosenbergs." The rally was organized by the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case.
　　At noon on the 3rd, large numbers of New York citizens representing various strata of society flocked to Randall's Island, many bringing their children and families. Despite the surveillance by the police and the influence of the cold weather, they gathered in the open-air stadium to demand the release of the Rosenbergs.
　　Branning, chairman of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, made a report at the meeting. In his report, he listed new facts and further exposed the US government's conspiracy to frame the Rosenbergs. Branning, based on irrefutable evidence, proved that the main "witness" Green Glass, utilized by the US judicial authorities, was a "hysterical, lying, delirious, and mentally deranged" person. The US judicial authorities actually sentenced the Rosenbergs to death based on such a person's fabricated so-called "testimony." The meeting also read out a statement by the famous American atomic scientist Dr. Urey, in which he reiterated that he still believed: "The Rosenbergs' testimony is more credible than Green Glass's testimony."
　　Julius Rosenberg's mother, on behalf of the Rosenbergs, expressed heartfelt gratitude at the meeting to all justice-upholding people around the world who were fighting to save the Rosenbergs.
　　According to an announcement by the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case on April 19th, the committee has submitted an appeal with the signatures of 20,000 people to the US Supreme Court, demanding a retrial of the "Rosenberg Case." As of now, the US Supreme Court has not made a decision since the Rosenbergs re-appealed to the US Supreme Court on March 30th.

    纽约一万市民集会要求释放罗森堡夫妇
   【新华社四日讯】纽约消息：纽约一万名左右的市民三日在纽约兰道尔岛运动场举行“拯救罗森堡夫妇”大会，这个大会是由美国争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会主持的。
    在三日午间，代表各个不同阶层的大批纽约市民源源不绝地前往兰道尔岛，许多人都携带子女全家出动。他们不顾警察的监视和阴冷的天气的影响，在露天的运动场上集会要求释放罗森堡夫妇。
    美国争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会主席布兰宁在大会上作了报告。他在报告中列举了新的事实，进一步揭露了美国政府诬害罗森堡夫妇的阴谋。布兰宁根据无可辩驳的证据，证明美国司法当局所利用的主要“见证人”格林格拉斯是一个“患有歇斯底里症的、好说谎话的、神志不清的、精神失常的”人，美国司法当局竟根据这样一个人的捏造出来的所谓“证词”来判处罗森堡夫妇死刑。会上还宣读了美国著名原子科学家尤雷博士的声明，他在声明中重申他仍然相信：“罗森堡夫妇的证词比格林格拉斯的证词更可信。”
    朱利叶斯·罗森堡的母亲在大会上代表罗森堡夫妇向全世界所有为拯救罗森堡夫妇而战斗的维护正义的人民表示衷心的感谢。
    据美国争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会四月十九日宣布：委员会已经向美国最高法院提出一份由两万人签名的呼吁书，要求重审“罗森堡案件”。按自从罗森堡夫妇在三月三十日向美国最高法院再度提出上诉以后，美国最高法院至今仍未作出决定。
