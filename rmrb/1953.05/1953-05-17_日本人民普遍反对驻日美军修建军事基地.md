Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th dispatch: The U.S. troops stationed in Japan are constantly building new military bases in various parts of Japan, arousing widespread protests and opposition from the Japanese people.

In the year since the enforcement of the U.S.-imposed separate peace treaty, the number of military bases used by U.S. troops in Japan has not decreased but has actually increased. According to "The Economist" magazine, the total area of land occupied by U.S. troops in Japan has reached 300.37 million "ping" (one "ping" equals 3.3 square meters). The U.S. military authorities are currently preparing to continue building many new military bases in Japan. The U.S. military authorities have designated 2,300 "cho" (one "cho" equals 0.99 hectares) of hilly land in the northern part of Sendai City as a training base for U.S. troops and plan to build a floating pier exclusively for U.S. military use near the Shiogama Port fish market not far from Sendai City. They also plan to build a naval base in Sugiiri on the opposite bank for the exclusive use of the Japanese "Maritime Safety Agency" vessels.

The U.S. military's military road construction project in the Mount Aso area of ​​Kyushu is also being accelerated. The road construction project connecting the foot of Mount Kuma and the outer mountains in the area has recently been completed. Many other military roads are being surveyed.

The U.S. military's continued occupation of Japanese land for military bases has aroused the angry opposition of the Japanese people. According to Agence France-Presse: "The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs receives protests and petitions against the use of existing or future military bases every day. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers this a serious problem." According to Japanese newspaper reports, the Hokuriku Railway Workers' Union unanimously decided on the 12th to refuse to transport materials to the U.S. military to protest the Yoshida government's allocation of land in Uchinada Village, Kahoku District, Ishikawa Prefecture, to the U.S. military as a firing range.

The struggle of Japanese residents against the base surveying work of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries occurs frequently. For example, in Oshima, Wakayama Prefecture, in western Japan, and in the Mount Asama area of ​​northeastern Japan, when government personnel sent to survey bases for the U.S. military arrived, local residents gathered, held red flags, and formed lines to prevent the surveyors from carrying out activities. In Chiezutsu (transliteration) on the outskirts of Sapporo, Hokkaido, matchboxes in hotels doing business with American soldiers are filled with small leaflets that read: "Go home, G.I.!"

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th dispatch: A recent broadcast by Tokyo Radio Station revealed the Yoshida government's secret and active rearmament activities.

According to Tokyo Radio Station, the Japanese "Security Agency" secretly established a so-called "Defense Committee" in extreme secrecy since October last year. Under the guise of formulating a "defense plan," this committee is collecting information from the Economic Deliberation Agency and military research groups composed of former soldiers to formulate a plan for Japan's rearmament. The plan formulated by the "Defense Committee" is to further strengthen the existing "Security Force" and "Maritime Guard Force." The Yoshida government is currently planning to quickly submit this rearmament plan to the United States in exchange for funding and other "assistance" from the U.S. "Mutual Security Agency."

This year’s May 1st International Labor Day saw 5 million workers and other laborers hold rallies and demonstrations across Japan.

    日本人民普遍反对驻日美军修建军事基地
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：驻日美军在日本各地不断地修建新的军事基地，激起日本人民普遍的抗议和反对。
    在美制单独和约生效以后的一年中，美军在日本各地的军事基地不仅没有减少，反而日益增多。据“经济学人”杂志透露：美军在日本占用的土地总面积已经达到三亿零三百七十万坪（每坪等于三点三平方公尺）。美军当局最近正在准备继续在日本修建许多新的军事基地。美军当局已把仙台市北部二千三百町步（每町步等于○·九九公顷）的丘陵地带指定作为美军的演习基地，并计划在离仙台市不远的盐釜港鲜鱼市场附近建立美军专用的浮桥，又计划把对岸的杉入地方修建一个海军基地，专供日本“海上保安厅”的舰艇使用。
    美军在九州阿苏山一带的军用公路建筑工程也正在加紧进行中。由该地区隈府的山脚联接外轮山的公路工程最近已经宣告完成。还有许多其他军用公路在测量中。
    美军继续霸占日本土地作军事基地的行为，激起了日本人民的愤怒的反对。据法新社透露：“日本外务省每天都收到反对使用现有的或将来的军事基地的抗议书和请愿书。外务省认为这是一个严重的问题。”据日本报纸消息：北陆铁道工人工会在十二日一致决定拒绝给美军运输物资，以抗议吉田政府当局将石川县河北郡内滩村的土地划给美军作打靶场之用。
    日本居民反对美、日反动派的基地勘察工作的斗争，经常发生。例如在日本西部的和歌山县大岛地方和日本东北部浅间山地区，当政府派去为美军勘察基地的人员到达时，当地居民纷纷集合起来，手拿红旗，排成队伍来阻止勘察人员进行活动。在北海道札幌的郊外智惠津（译音）地方，做美国兵生意的酒店内的火柴盒里装有小传单，上面写着：“滚回家去，美国佬！”
     【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：东京广播电台最近的广播，透露了吉田政府在暗中积极进行重新武装活动的秘密。
    据东京广播电台说：日本“保安厅”从去年十月起就在极端秘密中成立了一个所谓“防卫委员会”。这个委员会正在制订“防卫计划”的掩护下，向经济审议厅和旧军人组成的军事研究团体收集资料，拟订日本重整军备的计划。 “防卫委员会”所拟订的这项计划是要更进一步地加强现有的“保安队”和“海上警备队”。吉田政府目前正打算把这个重新武装的计划赶快提交给美国，以换取美国“共同安全署”的拨款等等“援助”。（附图片）
    今年的“五一”国际劳动节，在日本全国各地有五百万工人和其他劳动人民举行了庆祝大会和示威游行。这是东京市五十万人在明治神宫外苑广场举行的“日本第二十四届五一国际劳动节统一庆祝大会”会场。
