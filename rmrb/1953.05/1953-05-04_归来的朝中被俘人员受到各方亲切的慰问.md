Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th. Chinese People's Volunteer Army commanders and fighters are writing letters of condolence to the sick and wounded POWs who have returned to our side. All the commanders and fighters of the 5th company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who had won a collective third-class merit, wrote a letter of condolence from their position on "Dingzishan" in the northwest of Tieyuan, saying, "We are all very happy to hear the news of your return and hope that you will rest in peace and recover soon!"

Volunteer soldier Liang Huaiyu, who participated in the battle of a certain highland near Bianyandong on the eastern front, said in his condolence letter: "You have returned. I express my condolences to you for your heroic and unyielding struggle in the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps."

In many letters of condolence, the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army expressed their determination to continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the enemy, continue to work hard, and strive for the complete repatriation of all POWs on both sides and a reasonable solution to the Korean issue.
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th. The repatriated Korean and Chinese wounded and sick personnel are enjoying the culture and art of their motherland to the fullest. The Korean National Art Theater, the Korean People's Army Ensemble, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Cultural Troupe have each made one tour of performances to various hospitals. That is to say, except for the extremely serious patients, all the wounded and sick have seen three performances of song and dance programs. Moving scenes appear in every performance. Once, after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Cultural Troupe performed for the People's Army wounded and sick in a certain hospital, the wounded and sick sent representatives to present flowers to the comrades of the Cultural Troupe and gave a speech of thanks, saying: "We will never forget that it is the victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the front lines and the struggle of our representatives at the armistice negotiation conference that has allowed us to return to the embrace of our motherland. We must rest in peace and strive to recover as soon as possible." When the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Cultural Troupe performed for the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army on another occasion, everyone went to see it. The blind people sat in the front row. Although they could not see, they could hear and feel the kind art of the motherland. They said excitedly, "We have finally heard the voice of our motherland again!" When the People's Army Ensemble performed the dance "The Beacon Fire on Geoje Island" for the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army, the audience saw the past suffering and struggle reproduced on the stage, and remembered the comrades who had sacrificed and were still suffering in the US prisoner-of-war camps, and they all cried.

The six film teams of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have each screened three to four films in each hospital. These film teams have more than twenty-two new films, and they can also transfer new films from nearby film distribution stations and cinemas in Kaesong at any time.

The Korean-Chinese side has also prepared a large number of books and cultural and entertainment tools for the wounded and sick. The Volunteer Army alone prepared more than 600 copies of "People's Pictorial," 1,000 copies of "Liberation Army Pictorial," more than 900 copies of "Soviet" Pictorial, and 3,000 picture books; in addition, there were 600 decks of poker cards and 300 sets of checkers. Now every hospital has established a club, where the wounded and sick are reading and entertaining to their heart's content.

The acrobatics team of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army arrived in Kaesong on April 28th, and they will soon perform wonderful acrobatic programs for the wounded and sick.
