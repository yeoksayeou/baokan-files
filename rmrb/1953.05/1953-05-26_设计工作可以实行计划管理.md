    Design Work Can Implement Planned Management
    By Our Reporter  Angang
    With the help of Soviet experts, the design department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has begun to establish a relatively complete planned management system. The 1953 Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction design work plan was revised at the end of March. The work of the entire design department has been arranged into a unified production process, beginning to change the passive situation of the past where communication was lacking between different levels, the leadership and staff had no clear idea of progress, and many things were no one's responsibility. A new atmosphere has emerged. This has a significant impact on accurately completing the design tasks for 1953, ensuring the timely delivery of construction drawings, and systematically cultivating and improving technical strength.
    Before Ordering the Design Plan
    When Soviet experts arrived at the design department, they were most concerned about how we were formulating the 1953 design work plan. They believed that formulating a design plan was the central link in doing a good job in design work. Only by working according to the plan could the completion of tasks be guaranteed. At that time, the design office had also drawn up plans, but these were only explanations submitted to higher authorities to request personnel. This type of plan could not play a role in organizing internal forces and promoting work. Many departments were either busy or idle, many engineering projects were unclear, and problems such as when design drawings would be completed, how the main department and the supporting department would cooperate, and how to balance the workload had not been well resolved.
    Before ordering the plan, the design office took a series of measures.
    First, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the labor organization of the design workshop was adjusted according to the principle of professional division of labor. The original twelve sections were expanded to eighteen sections. Many businesses attached to other sections, such as furnace building, refractory materials, instruments, and gas, were independently established as sections according to professional principles. Sections with too many people and too few tasks were greatly reduced in manpower. For example, the electrical section was reduced from 191 to 119 people. A budget section was also added to be responsible for reviewing the budgets or estimates prepared in the designs of each section, making cost accounting an integral part of the design. This changed the shortcomings of the past where designers often ignored cost accounting. Various institutions have been established and have clear responsibilities. This is a very important condition for implementing the plan.
    The second is to establish the responsibility system for the heads of each design section and the general person in charge of engineering design. A group of cadres with organizational skills were assigned to serve as section chiefs. The section chief takes full responsibility for administrative and business management, changing the phenomenon of lack of unified leadership in the section in the past. At the same time, the responsibilities of the general person in charge of engineering design were determined, and a special responsibility system for the design of each project was implemented. The general person in charge of engineering design presides over the engineering design according to the task book assigned to him and maintains a unified cooperative relationship with the section chief. This responsibility system solves the problem of unified leadership in the formulation and implementation of plans.
    Finally, the ideological construction work carried out by the design office among the technical personnel also played a certain supporting role in the formulation of the plan. In the final stage of ideological construction, the design office mobilized the masses to initially criticize conservative design ideas. Therefore, in the process of ordering the plan, everyone was able to accept advanced ideas relatively smoothly.
    These measures have prepared favorable conditions for ordering the 1953 design work plan.
    Advanced Planning Forms
    Based on the advanced principles of ordering plans and combined with the specific conditions of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company design office, Soviet experts developed seven types of design plan forms: annual engineering project table, annual design work expansion table, monthly plan table for each section, progress table for the cooperation of each section in each engineering project, and workload estimation table for each engineering design (a total of three). The seven forms reasonably solve the annual workload and the amount of labor that should be used to complete the workload. The purpose of implementing these planning forms is to send the design documents and drawings to the approval authority and construction unit in accordance with the date approved by the state, so as to adapt to the requirements of the country's construction speed and ensure construction on the construction site.
    Specific Contents of the Seven Forms
    Open the first annual engineering project table, and you can see the total types of projects, project names, and annual progress stipulated by the state. Time occupies the most important position on this table. The progress of all work is controlled by the completion deadline (such as the date of delivery of drawings, the date of completion, etc.). The dates of construction and completion play the role of state instructions on this table and are the goals that the design department must guarantee to complete. In the arrangement of engineering projects, the construction projects of this planned year are the most important task and are placed first. Those minor projects that are not constructed in this planned year and designs that can be completed during the intervals of the main design are arranged in order at the back. This method of engineering queuing can concentrate efforts on completing the main engineering design and avoids our past problems of design staff not understanding the overall situation, not distinguishing priorities, and designing blindly. After the project is determined, each project design stipulates the specific date for the delivery of design documents or drawings in each design stage (ie, preliminary design, technical design, and construction drawings), and also arranges the date of receipt of equipment information. In the design plan, stipulating the date of receipt of equipment information can remind designers to pay attention to original data, break the habit of relying on subjective assumptions and closed-door construction, and make the engineering design conform to reality.
    The second annual design work expansion table expands the annual engineering plan, writing the workload and work completion date of a design project. The sum of these workloads is also the total design workload of the design office throughout the year. After reading this picture, the entire design work can be seen at a glance, so it is possible to balance the workload of each section, combine the "needs" of the design work with the "possibilities" of completing these tasks, so that each design department can accurately complete the plan.
    The third monthly plan table for each section is based on the first and second tables. The monthly plan stipulates the workload that each section will be responsible for each month, which is proposed jointly by each section and the planning section and approved by the design office. The method of instruction in the monthly plan is to use the cumulative percentage, including the cumulative percentage of the total workload actually completed last month and the cumulative percentage to be completed this planned month. This is the work target for each section each month. The leadership can announce the completion results every week according to the indicators and urge everyone to complete the plan on time.
    The fourth table is the progress table of the cooperation of each section in each engineering project. The design of various projects in the design department is completed by the main section and the supporting section. If everyone does not cooperate well, the construction period may be delayed due to one party's delay. The general person in charge of engineering design uses the fourth table to direct the progress of engineering design. On this table, the relationship and work progress of each section are expressed; one row of the table is the date when the main section issues the task, and the other row is the date when the supporting section completes the task. Then, extend these two dates to the intersection of the two sections and write the time when each section proposes and completes the task. The progress table can show the degree of mutual cooperation between each section according to the work procedures stipulated in the production process and indicate the time for each section to cooperate with each other to complete the task. The design director of the design office can prepare the engineering design progress according to this table and direct each section to coordinate its actions.
    The plan is an indicator of the actions of all cadres and directs the activities of all staff. Therefore, after the above monthly plan is determined, the most complicated problem in ordering the plan is to calculate the workload. The task of the fifth, sixth, and seventh tables is to prepare the workload required for each section to make preliminary designs, technical designs, and construction drawings. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company design office calls it the "work estimation table." Soviet experts proposed that there are two ways to estimate work: one is to calculate the cost of the design workload. In the Soviet Union, it is calculated in rubles (mainly the wages and other expenses of designers). To implement this calculation method, the design unit must have rich design experience and be equipped with experienced and skilled cadres. The second method is to estimate the workload in terms of the number of standard drawings. Although this method is not completely accurate, it can suit our current conditions and design level. The process of this method is: first, calculate how much workload there is in this year or this month, that is, how many drawings must be sent to the construction unit; second, classify according to the complexity of the drawings in each stage. For example, the simplest construction drawing takes three working days to complete, and the most complex construction drawing takes twenty-four working days. In the classification, give more time to the formulation of preliminary designs in particular. Preliminary designs take at least nine working days, and the most complex ones take thirty working days. This shows that the classification method is not average. It encourages designers to conduct thorough investigations and repeated thinking when determining preliminary designs and other principles, because if the preliminary design is wrong, the entire work will be lost. Third, determine the average quota. This time, the design quota of Anshan Iron and Steel Company takes the simplest construction drawing as the standard drawing unit. A standard drawing takes three working days. Convert various complex drawings using this standard quota to obtain the number of standard drawings that are converted into a total. From this, you can know how many working days it takes to complete an engineering project. The quota of standard drawings is not permanent. When formulating this quota, the experts considered the fact that our staff is not skilled in their work. Therefore, these three working days include the expert's explanations of various inquiries to the designers, looking at reference books, etc. In the future, when the work becomes proficient, the quota can be increased accordingly. Fourth, it is stipulated that the workload of each designer per month is eight standard drawings (this is the converted number, not the actual number of drawings. Some people who make complex drawings can complete one in a month. This refers to the converted number according to standard drawings). That is to say, each person must have a full twenty-four working days for design work each month. The content of working days includes various complex calculations, surveying and exploration work, and collecting original data needed to complete the design. This can correct the view of some comrades who simply regard design work as drawing in a room. After the average workload per person per month is stipulated, everyone will have a clear idea of their work and will naturally concentrate on completing the task and strive to break through the original quota.
    The seven planning forms arrange the responsibilities and work quotas of the design department from top to bottom, between the main department and the supporting department, and of each staff member. After the plan is determined, each design section can organize regular production competitions in a planned manner, implement the advanced to help the backward comrades, promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff, and strive to overfulfill or complete the task ahead of schedule.
    Promote Advanced Ideas and Oppose Conservative Ideas
    When Anshan Iron and Steel Company's design office formulated the design plan according to Soviet advanced experience, they first mobilized the design workers to study the seven forms and the Soviet method of ordering plans, made a mobilization report on ordering plans, and then launched the work of ordering plans. After the leaders summarized the plans initially formulated by each section, they found that the workload estimated for various design engineering tasks was too much, and it was impossible to complete all design tasks with the existing manpower. Many sections proposed conservative plans of varying degrees.
    The main reason for this phenomenon is that advanced indicators and reasonable quotas were ignored as the basis for ordering the plan, and the mobilization of the masses and the promotion of subjective initiative to ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by the state were ignored, and the concept of completing the national plan was not established. Some people are just "afraid of not completing the task" and "afraid of adding tasks in the future," so they hold the idea of "loose planning and tight use" and come up with various pretexts to increase working days, making the manpower required to complete the plan very large. Some people doubt that the prescribed standard quota is high, citing "the Soviet Union has a high technical level, and we can't keep up." Therefore, they added many so-called "objective conditions" when determining the workload. The Soviet Union stipulates that the working rate of a designer
    (that is, the time spent on design work in full) is 95.5% of the total working days. The design office stipulates that the working rate is 92%, but some departments have reduced the working rate to 70% to 75%. Some have included learning, summarizing and promoting experience, and holding cadre meetings. This is inappropriate because the advantage of ordering a plan is that it can concentrate the main time of the staff on design work. Other work that is not directly related to design should be carried out in the remaining 8% of the time. Some engineering designs have had lessons learned from rework. This time, in ordering the plan, the design time was not reduced because of the lessons learned. Instead, the time for rework was added. Some engineering designs are basically the same as those of the Soviet Union, but our planned working days are more than five times higher than those of the Soviet Union. The working days spent on the preparation work of some engineering designs are twice as large as the actual design time. Some people do not regard striving to implement advanced quotas as the greatest glory in the process of ordering design plans, but are afraid of "standing out." Two engineering designs of the same nature, one has an advanced and reasonable work estimation number, and the other is conservative. When they meet, the advanced one looks up to the backward one, fearing that it will be too
    "outstanding" and the task will not be completed. Some even count the engineering design that has been completed 80% from scratch and put it in the design plan, saying that this is the only way not to "suffer losses"... (To be continued)

    设计工作可以实行计划管理
    本报记者  安岗
    鞍山钢铁公司设计部门在苏联专家帮助下，开始建立一套比较完整的计划管理制度。一九五三年鞍钢基本建设设计工作计划，已经在三月底修订完毕。整个设计部门的工作被安排在一个统一的生产过程中，开始改变了过去上下不通气，领导机关和工作人员心中无数，许多事情无人负责的被动局面，出现了新的气象。这对于准确地完成一九五三年的设计任务，保证按时交出施工图纸，以及有计划地培养和提高技术力量有着重大影响。
    订设计计划以前
    苏联专家来到设计部门，他们最关心的是我们怎样制订一九五三年设计工作的计划。他们认为制订设计计划是搞好设计工作的中心环节，只有按计划做工作，完成任务才有保证。当时设计处也曾订过计划，但这只是为了向上级要人而提出的说明书，这种计划不能起组织内部力量，推动工作的作用。很多部门当时是忙的忙，闲的闲，不少工程项目不明确，设计图纸何时完成，主体科和配合科如何合作，工作量如何平衡等问题都没有得到很好的解决。
    订计划前，设计处采取了一系列的措施。
    首先是根据苏联专家的建议，按照专业分工原则调整了设计车间的劳动组织。把原有的十二个科扩大为十八个科，许多附属在其他科的业务如筑炉、耐火，计器燃气等都按照专业原则独立成科，人多事少的科大大紧缩了人力，如电气科由一百九十一人减至一百十九人。并增设了预算科，负责审核各科设计中编制的预算或概算，使成本核算成为设计的一个组成部分，改变了过去设计人员常常忽略成本核算的缺点。各个机构建立起来了，并有了明确的职责。这对于贯彻执行计划是一个很重要的条件。
    其次是建立各设计科科长和工程设计总负责人的责任制。配备了一部分有组织能力的干部担任科长。科长全面负起行政和业务管理的责任，改变了过去科内工作缺乏统一领导的现象。同时确定了工程设计总负责人的职责，实行对各个工程的设计专责制，工程设计总负责人按交付他的任务书主持工程设计，并同科长保持统一合作的关系。这种责任制解决了制订和执行计划的统一领导问题。
    最后是设计处在技术人员中进行的思想建设工作，对于制订计划也起了一定的配合作用。设计处在思想建设最后阶段，发动群众初步地批判了保守的设计思想。因而在订计划中，大家能够比较顺利地接受了先进的思想。
    这些措施都为订好一九五三年设计工作计划准备了有利的条件。
    先进的计划表格
    苏联专家按照先进的订计划的原则结合鞍钢设计处的具体条件，制订了七种设计计划的表格：全年工程项目表，全年设计工作的展开表，各科的月计划表，每个工程项目中各科工作配合的进度表，每个工程设计的工作量估计表（共三个）。七张表格合理地解决了全年的工作量及为完成工作量所应使用的劳动量。实行这些计划表格的目的是要按照国家批准的日期把设计文件及图纸发给批准机关和施工单位，以便适应国家建设速度的要求，保证工地施工。
    七种表格的具体内容
    打开第一张全年工程项目表，可以看到国家规定的全年的工程总类，项目名称及全年进度。在这张表上，时间占了最重要的位置。一切工作的进度都是用完成的期限来控制着的（如图纸交付日期，竣工日期等）。施工和竣工的日期在这张表上起着国家指令的作用，是设计部门必须保证完成的奋斗目标。在工程项目的排列中，本计划年的施工工程是头等的重要任务，放在第一位。那些不是在本计划年内施工的次要的工程以及可以在主要设计间隙中做完的设计都按次序排在后面。这种工程排队的方法可以集中力量完成主要工程设计，避免了我们过去设计工作人员不了解整体、不分主次、盲目设计的毛病。项目确定后，每一项目工程设计都规定每个设计阶段（即初步设计、技术设计、施工图）交付设计文件或图纸的确定日期，还安排了设备资料收到日期。在设计计划中，规定了设备资料收到日期，就可以提醒设计人员重视原始资料，打破凭主观臆想，闭门造车的毛病，使工程设计符合实际。
    第二张全年设计工作的展开表上，展开了全年的工程计划，上面写着一个设计项目的工作量和工作完成日期。这些工作量的总和也就是设计处全年设计的总工作量。看了这张图，对全部设计工作可以一目了然，因而也就有可能平衡各科工作的工作量，把设计工作的“需要”和完成这些工作的“可能性”结合起来，使各个设计部门能够准确地完成计划。
    第三张各科的月计划表是根据第一和第二两表提出来的月份计划。月计划中规定了各科每月要担负的工作量，是由各科与计划科共同提出并经由设计处批准的每月设计工作计划。月计划指示的方法是用百分比的累计数，其中包括有上月实际完成的全部工作量的百分累计数，本计划月要完成的百分比累计数。这是每个月各科的工作指标。领导上可以按照指标每周公布完成结果，督促大家按时完成计划。
    第四表是每个工程项目中各科工作配合的进度表。设计部门各项工程设计都是由主体科和配合科负责完成的，如果大家配合得不好，就有可能因为一方耽误而拖延工期。工程设计总负责人用第四表指挥工程设计的进度，这张表上，各科相互配合的关系及工作进度都表现出来了；表上一排是主体科发出任务的日期，一排是配合科完成任务的日期，然后，把这两个日期引伸到两科相交的地方，写上各科提出任务和完成任务的时间。进度表能表示各科按生产过程所规定的工作程序互相配合的程度，指明各科互相配合完成任务的时间。设计处设计总负责人可以根据这个表编制工程设计进度，指挥各科协同动作。
    计划是全体干部行动的指标，是指挥全体工作人员活动的，因此，在上项月计划确定后，订计划的最复杂的问题便是计算工作量。第五，第六，第七表的任务是编制各科作初步设计、技术设计、施工图所需要的工作量。鞍钢设计处称之为“估工表”。苏联专家提出：估工的办法有两种，一种是按照设计工作量的成本核算，在苏联即是以卢布为核算单位（主要是设计人员的工资等费用）。实行这种计算方法，设计单位必须具有丰富的设计经验，还必须配备经验多，工作熟练的干部。其次一个方法是以标准图纸的张数为单位来估计工作量，这个方法虽不完全精确，但能适合我们今天的条件和设计水平。这种方法的过程是：第一，计算一下本年或本月一共有多少工作量，即要向施工单位发出多少图纸；第二按照各阶段的图纸的复杂性进行分类，譬如最简单的施工图是三个工日完成一张，最复杂的施工图纸要二十四个工日一张，在分类中特别给制订初步设计以更多的时间，初步设计起码是九个工日，最复杂的要用三十个工日，这就说明分类的办法不是平均的，它鼓励设计人员在确定初步设计等原则问题时多作周密的调查研究和反复思考，因为，初步设计错了，整个工作都要受到损失。第三是确定平均定额，这次鞍钢的设计定额是以最简单的施工图作为标准图纸单位，标准图纸是三个工日一张。用这个标准定额折合各类复杂图纸，得出一共折合成标准图纸的张数，由此就可以知道，完成一个工程项目共需要多少工日。标准图纸的定额不是永久不变的，专家在制订这个定额时，曾经考虑到了我们的工作人员工作不熟练的情况，因而在这三个工日中包括了专家对设计人员各种询问的讲解，看参考书等等在内，将来工作熟练了，定额就可以随之提高。第四是规定每一个设计人员每月的工作量为八张标准图纸（这是折合数而不是实际的图纸张数，有的人作复杂图可以一个月完成一张，这里是指按标准图纸的折合数），这就是说，每月每人作设计工作要有十足的二十四个工日。工日的内容包括了为完成设计需要的各种复杂的计算，测量探测工作以及搜集原始资料的工作。这就可以纠正了某些同志把设计工作单纯看作是坐在屋子里构图的观点。每人每月平均工作量规定后，大家作工作心中有数，自然会集中精力完成工作任务，争取突破原有定额。
    七个计划表格中安排了设计部门上下之间，主体科和配合科之间以及每一个工作人员的职责范围和工作定量。计划确定后，各个设计科就可以有计划地组织经常性的生产竞赛，实行先进的对落后的同志帮助，发扬工作人员积极性创造性，争取超额或提前完成任务。
    发扬先进思想反对保守思想
    鞍钢设计处按照苏联先进经验制订设计计划时，他们首先发动设计工作者学习七种表格和苏联订计划的方法，作了订计划的动员报告，然后展开了订计划的工作。领导上把各科第一次制订的计划汇总后，发现各项设计工程任务估工过多，以现有人力无法完成全部设计任务，很多科提出来的都是程度不同的保守的计划。
    产生这种现象的最主要原因是在订计划时忽视了以先进的指标和合理的定额作为订计划的依据，忽视了发动群众，发挥主观积极性来保证完成国家交付的任务，建立完成国家计划的观念。有的人只是“怕完不成任务”，“怕将来追加任务”，因而抱着“宽打窄用”的思想，想出各种名目来增多工作日，使完成计划所需的人力变得十分庞大。有的人藉口“苏联技术水平高，我们跟不上”，怀疑规定的标准定额高，因而在确定工作量时加进去了许多所谓的“客观条件”。苏联规定一个设计人员的作业率
    （即十足的作设计工作的时间）为全部工作日的百分之九十五·五。设计处规定的作业率是百分之九十二，但有的部门却把作业率降低到百分之七十到七十五。有的把学习，总结推广经验，开干部会等都列进去了。这是不适当的，因为订计划的好处就在于能够集中工作人员的主要时间去作设计工作。其他与设计没有直接关系的工作都应在其余的百分之八的时间内进行。有些工程设计是有过返工教训的。这次在订计划中并没有因为有了教训而减少了设计时间，反而把返工的时间也加进去了。有的工程设计同苏联的基本相同，但我们计划的工日却比苏联的高出五倍还多。有的工程设计的准备工作项目花费的工日比实际设计时间要大两倍。有的人在订设计计划过程中不是以争取实行先进定额为最大的光荣，而是怕“冒尖”，两个性质相同的工程设计，一个估工数是先进而合理的，一个则是保守的。碰在一起，先进的却向落后的看齐，怕搞得
    “突出”完不成任务。还有的把已经完成百分之八十的工程设计从零算起放在设计计划中，据说这样才算不“吃亏”……（未完）
