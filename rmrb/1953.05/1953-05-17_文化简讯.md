　　Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee Trains Large Numbers of Patriotic Health Campaign Backbone Personnel
　　The Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee is training large numbers of workers, students, and neighborhood residents to become the backbone of the patriotic health campaign. The first batch, totaling over 20,000 neighborhood residents, began training in early May. Most of the lecturers are private Western doctors, with some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners serving as assistant lecturers. Before the large-scale training began, key pilot training was conducted in eight districts, and the pilot work concluded at the end of April. Sixty-nine people from the Beiping Village of Xuzhen Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai, a Grade B model unit in the 1952 National Patriotic Health Campaign, stated after training that they would go deep into the masses to promote and take the lead in doing a good job in patriotic health work. The training work in factories and schools is also undergoing key pilot programs.

　　The Northwest People's Publishing House recently published a record book of folk music, "Shaanxi Daoqing Music." This book includes more than one hundred Daoqing tunes, which were collected by the author, Liang Wenda, in 1951 in areas along the Yellow River in northern Shaanxi. They were compiled after research and collation by the Cultural Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee and the Northwest Branch of the All-China Musicians Association. Shaanxi Daoqing is loved by the people of northern Shaanxi, and is performed annually during the Spring Festival by some outstanding folk actors. The performance forms include both sitting and stage performances, which can be accompanied by instruments such as the sanxian, siyinhu, guanzi, banhu, small cymbals, yu drum, hand gongs, and bangzi. The tunes are bright and melodious.
