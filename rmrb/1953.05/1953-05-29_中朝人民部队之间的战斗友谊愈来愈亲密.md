Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 28th: The combat friendship between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army is becoming increasingly close. They fight side-by-side against the enemy on the front lines and often exchange combat experience.

    The Chinese and Korean People's forces, who are jointly defending a certain position, recently held a forum to exchange the military and political work experience of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Shangganling campaign and the Korean People's Army in the "Heartbreak Ridge" campaign. They also studied tactical and enemy situation issues for future combat. Heroes and model workers from the Chinese and Korean People's forces also held a forum. After the meeting, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army made a resolution calling on all commanders and fighters to implement the spirit of this forum, further strengthen the fraternal unity with the heroic Korean People's Army, and achieve mutual learning and mutual assistance in peacetime, and mutual support and close cooperation in wartime.

    The Chinese and Korean People's forces also demonstrated a high degree of unity and fraternal spirit in jointly building fortifications. When the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and a certain unit of the Korean People's Army were building fortifications together at a certain location, the Fifth Company lacked people who knew how to mix cement. The People's Army sent three soldiers who knew how to mix cement to help. The commanders and fighters of the First Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army introduced their experience in building fortifications to the People's Army unit that was jointly guarding a certain position, and, with the approval of their superiors, extracted some tools for building fortifications from the company and gave them to the People's Army.

    The Chinese and Korean People's forces also often hold get-togethers and mutual visits on the positions they jointly guard. During the "May Fourth" Youth Day this year, Korean People's Army soldiers sent representatives with gifts to the positions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to congratulate the young Volunteer Army soldiers. Volunteer Army soldiers also often offer their share of comfort goods to visit the People's Army units, encouraging each other to fight more heroically to defend world peace.

    中朝人民部队之间的战斗友谊愈来愈亲密
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军之间的战斗友谊愈来愈亲密了，他们在前线阵地上并肩打击敌人，还时常在一起交换作战经验。
    并肩守卫在某处阵地上的中朝人民部队最近举行了一个座谈会，交流中国人民志愿军在上甘岭作战中和朝鲜人民军在“伤心岭”作战中的军事、政治工作经验，并对今后作战中的战术、敌情等问题也作了研究；中朝人民部队的英雄和功臣也举行了座谈会。会后，中国人民志愿军某部作出决议，号召全体指挥员、战斗员贯彻这次座谈会的精神，进一步加强与英雄的朝鲜人民军部队兄弟般的团结，做到在平时互相学习、互相帮助，在战时互相支援、密切配合。
    中朝人民部队在一道修筑阵地中，也表现了高度的团结友爱精神。中国人民志愿军某部第五连和朝鲜人民军某部并肩在某处修筑阵地时，第五连缺少会拌水泥的人，人民军就派了三位会拌水泥的战士来帮助。志愿军某部第一连的指挥员、战斗员们把自己构筑阵地的工作经验介绍给并肩守卫在某处阵地上的人民军部队，并经上级批准从连里抽出了一部分构筑阵地的工具送给人民军。
    中朝人民部队还时常在并肩守卫的阵地上举行联欢会，和互相进行慰问。今年“五四”青年节时，朝鲜人民军战士们派了代表，带着礼物到中国人民志愿军的阵地上来向志愿军的青年战士们祝贺。志愿军战士们也常常把自己分到的慰问品献出来去慰问人民军部队，互相鼓励为保卫世界和平而更加英勇地作战。
