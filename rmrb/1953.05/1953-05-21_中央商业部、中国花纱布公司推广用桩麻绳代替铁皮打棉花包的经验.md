The Central Ministry of Commerce and the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company have been universally promoting the advanced experience of "using ramie rope instead of iron straps for baling cotton" throughout the country since April. It is estimated that the adoption of this method nationwide will save the country 28 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs annually. Because ramie is a slow-selling domestic product, while iron straps need to be imported, using ramie rope for baling cotton can not only find a market for slow-selling domestic ramie but also save a large amount of foreign exchange used to purchase iron straps. If this foreign exchange is used to purchase other materials from abroad, it can buy 200 working machine tools (lathes) or 13,000 tons of steel plates.

Using ramie rope instead of iron straps for baling cotton is a rationalization proposal put forward by Li Wansong, a salesman of the Hubei Provincial Trade Company, and successfully tested by the Central-South China Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company.

When promoting this advanced experience, the Central Ministry of Commerce felt that the past practices of issuing instructions, circulars, and publishing in internal publications had limited effect, and therefore adopted the following methods: 1. Appointing dedicated personnel to be responsible for collecting materials on the use of ramie rope instead of iron straps for baling, formulating promotion steps and methods, and carrying out promotion in a planned manner; 2. Using the method of calculating the big picture and the detailed accounts to persuade the baling factories to switch to using ramie rope for baling cotton. For example, according to the calculations of the Shijiazhuang Baling Factory, using iron straps for baling would increase costs by 4.9 billion yuan per year compared to using ramie rope, and delaying the switch to ramie rope would cost an additional 10 million yuan per day. Therefore, the factory decided to switch to ramie rope for baling immediately. 3. Using operational demonstrations to dispel workers' concerns about using ramie rope for baling cotton. At the beginning of the promotion of this experience, some workers were afraid of the bales bursting due to insufficient tensile strength of the ramie, afraid that using ramie rope would affect packaging efficiency, afraid that the difficulty of threading the ramie rope through the holes would affect operating speed, and afraid that the machines were not suitable for using ramie rope. However, after actual users introduced that there were no burst bales during long-distance cotton transportation; and the cotton bales baled with ramie rope were dropped from the third floor for testing, proving that they were as strong as those baled with iron straps; and the comrades who performed the demonstrations on the spot provided detailed explanations during the operation, some comrades' aforementioned concerns were eliminated. In order to ensure that baling factories across the country thoroughly implement the method of using ramie rope for baling cotton, the Central Ministry of Commerce decided that the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company should assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for assisting local baling factories in promoting and further learning from the experience of using ramie for baling cotton. In addition, it instructed all baling factories to periodically prohibit the use of iron straps for baling domestically transferred cotton based on specific circumstances; the original stock of iron straps for baling should be reported to the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in quantity for unified allocation, specifically for the export cotton baling. Individual baling factories that use ramie rope for baling should also switch to ramie within a time limit because ramie is two and a half times more expensive than ramie and is an export commodity. For public and private baling factories that are not under the leadership of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the local commercial administrative leading organs should assist the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in consulting with them. The processing fees should be calculated based on the cost of using ramie materials, or the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company should provide ramie rope itself, implementing a method of contracting labor but not materials, in order to promote the use of ramie for baling. Regarding the supply of ramie, the baling factories should propose the required quantities based on the baling plan and request the local commercial administrative leading organs to assist and the local trade companies or tobacco and hemp companies to jointly study and resolve the issue.

### 中央商业部、中国花纱布公司推广用桩麻绳代替铁皮打棉花包的经验

    中央商业部、中国花纱布公司推广用桩麻绳代替铁皮打棉花包的经验
    中央人民政府商业部、中国花纱布公司从四月份起，在全国各地普遍推广“用桩麻绳代替铁皮打棉花包”的先进经验。预计全国各地采用这一方法，全年可为国家节省商品流转费用二百八十亿元。因为桩麻是国内滞销产品，而铁皮却需要国外进口，使用桩麻绳打棉花包，不但可以为国内滞销的桩麻找到销路，还可节省一大笔购买铁皮的外汇。如果把这笔外汇向国外购买别的物资，可以购进二百台工作母机（车床）或一万三千吨钢板。
    用桩麻绳代替铁皮打棉花包，是湖北省贸易公司业务员李万松提出的合理化建议，给中国花纱布公司中南区公司试验成功的。
    中央商业部在推广这一先进经验时，感到过去推广先进经验采用指示、通报、登载内部刊物等做法作用不太大，因而采取了如下方法：一、指派专人负责，搜集桩麻绳代替铁皮打包的材料，拟订推广步骤及方法，有计划地进行推广；二、用算大账和算细账的办法来说服打包厂改用桩麻绳打棉花包。例如石家庄打包厂经算账的结果，用铁皮打包比用桩麻绳打包，一年要增加费用四十九亿元，迟一天改用桩麻绳打包就要多开支一千数百万元。于是该厂就决定即日改用桩麻绳打包。三、用操作表演的方法，消除职工对用桩麻绳打棉花包的种种顾虑。在开始推广这一经验时，有的职工怕因桩麻拉力不够而崩包，怕用桩麻绳后影响包装效能，怕麻绳穿孔困难影响操作速度，怕机器不适合不能使用桩麻绳。但经过实际使用者介绍了远距离运棉并未崩包；又把用桩麻绳打的棉花包从三层楼抛下试验，证明与铁皮打包一样坚实；当场表演的同志又在操作过程中详细加以解说后，某些同志的上述种种顾虑就被消除了。为使全国各打包厂彻底执行用桩麻绳打棉花包的办法，中央商业部除决定由中国花纱布公司指派专人负责协助各地打包厂推行和进一步吸取用桩麻打棉花包的经验外，并指示各打包厂，对国内调拨的棉花，应根据具体情况，定期禁止使用铁皮打包；原存打包用的铁皮，应将数量报告中国花纱布公司，统一调剂，专供出口棉花打包之用。个别打包厂有使用苎麻绳打包的，因苎麻价比桩麻高二倍半，且为出口物资，也应限期改用桩麻。对不属花纱布公司领导的公、私营打包厂，应由所在地商业行政领导机关协助花纱布公司与之进行协商，其工缴费用应按使用桩麻材料成本计算，或由花纱布公司自备桩麻绳，实行包工不包料的办法，以促其用桩麻打包。对桩麻的供应问题，应由打包厂根据打包计划，提出需用数量，请当地商业行政领导机关协助和地方贸易公司或烟麻公司共同研究解决。
