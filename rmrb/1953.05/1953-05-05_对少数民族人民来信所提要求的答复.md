    Reply to Requests Made in Letters from Minority Peoples
      Editor's Note: On February 26th, this newspaper's "Reader's Letters in Brief" column published "Requests from Minority Peoples Regarding Production and Study." The Animal Husbandry Department of the Iketu League Autonomous Region People's Government in Suiyuan Province and the Ningyuan County People's Government in Hunan Province have respectively replied, and excerpts are published below.
    The Animal Husbandry Department of the Iketu League Autonomous Region's Reply on the Issue of Livestock Breed Improvement
    The Animal Husbandry Department of the Iketu League Autonomous Region People's Government wrote: Mao Nao Hai, a Mongolian herdsman from the third administrative village of the second district of the Junwang Banner in our league, requested that the People's Government assist them in improving their livestock breeds. This spirit of concern for the development of animal husbandry is excellent. Our league attaches great importance to livestock work. Since liberation, under the call of the People's Government, the masses of herdsmen in our league have shifted from relying on natural grazing to grazing with assigned personnel and have begun to pay attention to breeding work. This spring, the Dalat and Zhungeer Banners convened symposiums for private breeding households to exchange experiences in breeding work and study plans for regular mating and determining the number of female animals each breeding animal should mate with to avoid pregnancies that do not result in offspring. Due to the vast area of our league and the scattered distribution of herdsmen, the main method of improving livestock breeds at present can only be to select local public animals of better quality as breeding stock. The method of using foreign breeding stock for mating can currently only be done in individual areas with planning and will be promoted when conditions are more mature in the future.
    The Ningyuan County People's Government's Reply on the Issue of Building Schoolhouses for the Yao People
    The Ningyuan County People's Government of Hunan Province wrote: We have seen the letter from the people of the Zijinghe Yao Autonomous Township in the fourth district of our county requesting the People's Government to help build schoolhouses. The amount of funds allocated for construction in our county's ethnic minority education expenses this year has recently been determined and is prepared to be used with emphasis. We have now notified the people's governments of each district to understand the situation and submit budgets for the schoolhouses in the local Yao people's primary schools that urgently need to be built to the county. As for the construction of schoolhouses in Zijinghe Yao Autonomous Township, we have notified the cultural and educational cadres of the Fourth District People's Government by telephone to understand the specific situation and make appropriate arrangements within the allowable scope of the funds allocated by the state.

### 对少数民族人民来信所提要求的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对少数民族人民来信所提要求的答复
      编者按：二月二十六日，本报“读者来信摘要”栏发表了“少数民族人民来信提出有关生产和学习的两个要求”。绥远省伊克昭盟自治区人民政府畜牧处和湖南省宁远县人民政府已分别来信答复，现摘要发表于后。
    伊克昭盟自治区畜牧处对改良畜种问题的答复
    伊克昭盟自治区人民政府畜牧处来信：我盟郡王旗二区三行政村蒙族牧民冒瑙海提出了希望人民政府协助他们改良畜种工作的要求，这种关心牧畜事业发展的精神是很好的。我盟很重视畜种工作。解放以来，在人民政府号召下，我盟牧民群众已从靠天放牧转为跟人放牧，并开始重视了配种工作。今春我盟达拉特、准格尔两旗曾召集了民营配种户座谈会，交流了配种工作的经验，研究了今后按期交配及确定每头种畜应配母畜数以免空怀的计划。由于我盟地区辽阔，牧民居住分散，目前改良畜种的主要方法只能是就地取材，选择当地品种较好的公畜为种畜；利用外来种畜配种的办法，目前只能在个别地区有计划地来作，待将来条件成熟时再推广。
    宁远县人民政府对修建瑶族人民小学校舍问题的答复
    湖南省宁远县人民政府来信：我县四区紫荆河瑶族自治乡人民要求人民政府帮助建筑校舍的来信已经看到了。我县今年少数民族教育费中用于修建的经费数量最近已经确定，准备重点使用，现已通知各区人民政府了解情况后将当地瑶族人民小学急需修建的校舍造具预算送县。至于紫荆河瑶族自治乡的小学校舍修建问题，我们已用电话通知四区人民政府文教干部了解具体情况，在国家所拨经费允许的条件下作妥善解决。
