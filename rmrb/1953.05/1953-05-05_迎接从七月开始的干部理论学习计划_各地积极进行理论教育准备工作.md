    In Preparation for the Cadre Theoretical Study Plan Starting in July
    All Regions Are Actively Conducting Theoretical Education Preparations
   [Report from this newspaper] Following the publication of the "Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Cadre Theoretical Education for 1953-1954," the work of Marxist-Leninist theoretical education for cadres in various regions has received a tremendous new impetus. Generally, cadres warmly welcome the Central Committee's directive, believing that further systematic study of the basic laws of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, based on the study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), is of great benefit to completing the current great economic construction tasks. Many cadres believe that from now on, they should more earnestly and systematically strengthen their theoretical study.

    After the Central Committee's directive was issued, Party committees in various regions are actively carrying out various preparatory tasks to welcome the new study plan starting in July. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau and the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau will soon convene meetings of responsible cadres from the theoretical education departments and study offices of various provinces and cities to summarize past theoretical education work and study the specific steps for implementing the Central Committee's directive. The Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau plans to discuss current theoretical education work at the meeting of propaganda ministers of various provinces and cities to be held in June.

    Central-level organs and various central bureaus are actively preparing for or have already begun the training of theoretical instructors in accordance with the Central Committee's directive in order to strengthen study guidance in the future. The Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the CPC Central Committee is working with the Party Committee of the Organs of the Central People's Government to jointly formulate a theoretical instructor training plan. The Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau and the Party School of the Northeast Bureau had already trained a group of intermediate-level instructors to lecture on Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" and Lenin and Stalin's works on Soviet socialist economic construction. Now they are preparing to open the second phase of research classes for intermediate-level instructors and counselors in May or June, drawing cadres at the level of prefectural committee members and bureau/department director level of provinces and cities to study off-the-job. Both of these research classes are short-term, lasting two to three months. The quota for North China is 75, and for the Northeast, it is 150. After these full-time instructors and counselors graduate and return to their provinces, they will use the method of transmission to train more instructors and counselors. The Southwest Bureau has issued a "Notice on Training On-the-Job Cadre Theoretical Instructors from Organs Above the Prefectural Committee Level." The notice stipulates that the Party School of the Southwest Bureau will uniformly train intermediate and primary theoretical instructors from first-level organs in the Southwest Region and organs in Chongqing City from May to July. In addition to stipulating that each first-level organ in the Southwest Region and Chongqing City should be equipped with 11 intermediate-level theoretical instructors, and each prefectural committee should be equipped with one intermediate-level theoretical instructor, the Southwest Bureau's notice also stipulates that each province and city should equip one intermediate-level instructor for every 500 to 1,000 cadres participating in intermediate-level study groups, and one primary-level instructor for every 500 cadres participating in primary-level study groups (the ratio may be lower in areas where personnel are concentrated, and higher in areas where personnel are dispersed). The East China Region and the Central South Region are using the form of Marxist-Leninist theoretical night schools to train part-time instructors. The night school of the Party School of the East China Bureau opened on April 25, with more than 500 intermediate-level theoretical instructors participating in the study. The night school in the Central South Region is scheduled to open on May 20, with more than 400 intermediate and primary-level theoretical instructors participating. The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee has organized lectures, absorbing more than 1,000 part-time intermediate-level counselors and primary-level theoretical instructors to attend.

    In order to strengthen specific guidance for study, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau is also preparing to convene a teaching research conference for intermediate-level instructors and counselors before the start of each chapter of "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" Chapters 9 to 12 to specifically study the content and teaching methods of each chapter. In addition, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau has transferred cadres and established a study office. Before the start of the new study, the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau promoted the establishment of cadre spare-time Party schools. Now, the newly established cadre spare-time Party schools include six from the directly subordinate organs of the Northwest Bureau and the leading organs of mass organizations, and nineteen from the organs affiliated with the Northwest Administrative Committee. Shaanxi Province originally had seven, but now it has increased to ten. In addition, Gansu Province has established five, Ningxia and Qinghai each have two, and Xi'an City has established eight. The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee has added 31 more cadre spare-time Party schools in addition to the original 16, including two intermediate-level schools.

      The People's Publishing House and Xinhua Bookstore and other publishing and distribution organs are actively preparing to supply learning materials in a timely manner in accordance with the provisions in the Central Committee's directive. In order to facilitate reading, it has been decided to publish Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" and other documents that are required reading in the Central Committee's directive into four volumes according to chapter. Since the documents studied by the intermediate-level group are fewer than those studied by the advanced-level group, two versions, "for advanced-level group" and "for intermediate-level group," will be published simultaneously. The compiled learning materials are tentatively named "On Soviet Socialist Economic Construction," and the first volume is scheduled to be published on June 15.

    迎接从七月开始的干部理论学习计划
    各地积极进行理论教育准备工作
   【本报讯】“中共中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”发表后，各地干部马克思列宁主义理论教育工作获得了巨大的、新的推动力。一般干部都热烈欢迎中央的指示，认为在学习联共（布）第十九次代表大会文件的基础上，进一步系统地学习苏联社会主义建设的基本规律，对完成当前的伟大的经济建设任务有极大的益处。许多干部认为从现在起应该更认真地、有系统地加强自己的理论学习。
    在中央指示发布后，各地党委为了迎接从七月开始的新的学习计划，正在积极进行各种准备工作。东北局宣传部和中南局宣传部即将召开各省市理论教育处和学习室负责干部的会议，总结过去的理论教育工作，研究执行中央指示的具体步骤。华北局宣传部预备在六月召开的各省市宣传部长会议上讨论当前的理论教育工作。
    中央一级机关和各中央局都根据中央的指示，积极准备或已经开始了理论教员的训练工作，以便加强今后的学习指导。中共中央直属机关党委正在和中央人民政府机关党委，共同拟订理论教员训练计划。华北局宣传部和东北局党校，在不久以前都已经训练了一批讲授“联共（布）党史”第九章到第十二章和列宁、斯大林论苏联社会主义经济建设的中级组教员，现在正准备在五月或六月开办第二期中级教员、辅导员的研究班，抽调地委委员一级、省市的局、处长一级干部离职学习。这两个研究班都是短期的，时间是两个月到三个月。华北准备训练的名额是七十五名，东北是一百五十名。这些专职教员、辅导员毕业回省后，将由他们用传授的方式，训练更多的教员、辅导员。西南局已经发出“关于训练地委以上机关在职干部理论教员的通知”。通知中规定西南局党校在五月至七月统一训练西南区一级机关和重庆市机关的中级和初级理论教员。西南局的通知中除了规定西南区一级机关、重庆市机关应配备中级理论教员十一名、每一地委配备中级理论教员一名外，并规定各省市按参加中级组学习干部人数每五百人至一千人配备中级组教员一名，按参加初级组学习干部每五百人配备初级组教员一名（人员集中地方可低于这一比例，反之则可高于这一比例）。华东区和中南区采用马克思列宁主义理论夜校的形式，训练兼职教员。华东局党校的夜校已在四月二十五日开学，参加学习的中级理论教员五百余人；中南区的夜校准备在五月二十日开学，参加学习的将有中、初级组理论教员四百余人。北京市委宣传部已经组织了讲座，吸收兼职的中级组辅导员和初级组理论教员一千多人听讲。
    为了加强对学习的具体指导，东北局宣传部还准备在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章的每章开始前，召集中级组教员、辅导员开一次教学研究会，具体研究每章内容和教学方法。另外，东北局宣传部已调集干部，成立了学习室。西北局宣传部在开始新的学习前，推广举办了干部业余党校，现在新建立的干部业余党校有西北局直属机关和群众团体领导机关的六所，西北行政委员会所属机关的十九所。陕西省原有七所，现增加到十所。此外，甘肃省建立了五所，宁夏、青海各二所，西安市建立了八所。武汉市委除原有的十六所干部业余党校外，又增设了三十一所，其中两所是中级组的。
      人民出版社和新华书店等出版发行机关正在按照中央指示中的规定，积极准备及时供应学习资料，为了便于阅读，已决定把“联共（布）党史”第九章至第十二章和中央指示中规定必读的其它文件，按章分为四册出版。由于中级组所学的文件比高级组少，并准备同时出版“高级组用”、“中级组用”的两种版本。汇印的学习资料拟定名为“论苏联社会主义经济建设”，第一册准备在六月十五日出版。
