Localities Intensify Training for Cadres Tasked with Grassroots Election Work

To prepare for the upcoming grassroots election work, various localities are drawing large numbers of guiding cadres and technical personnel who will be responsible for election work for concentrated training.

The training of cadres participating in election work in various localities is generally carried out in batches according to the steps of launching the grassroots election movement in the local area. Among them, the cadres participating in typical pilot projects and the first batch of grassroots elections are currently undergoing intensive training or are about to begin training. Many provinces and cities have also formulated training plans for cadres participating in the second or third batch of grassroots elections. Shandong Province is about to begin training approximately 7,000 guiding cadres and more than 5,000 technical personnel needed to complete the first batch of grassroots elections, requiring completion by mid-June. The more than 10,500 guiding cadres and more than 6,700 technical personnel needed to supplement the second batch of grassroots elections are expected to be trained by early September. In the Northeast region, Jilin, Songjiang, and Lushun-Dalian (Luda) and other provinces and cities have trained more than 780 cadres. Other provinces and cities are also preparing to conduct training from mid-May to mid-July. Henan Province began training its first batch of 587 cadres to guide grassroots elections in late May. In Gansu Province, more than 1,400 cadres drawn from provincial-level organs to participate in grassroots election work began studying in two batches on May 10th and 16th.

In some provinces and cities, the training of cadres participating in grassroots elections has been completed, and these trained cadres have already been or are about to be sent to typical pilot areas for experimentation. In Shanghai, Jinan, Shaanxi and other places, the cadres participating in the typical pilot work of grassroots elections have undergone training in advance. The first batch of 400 cadres in Chongqing to guide grassroots elections will be trained by the end of May. More than 800 guiding cadres and technical personnel participating in the first batch of grassroots elections in Chengdu have also been trained and will be assigned to various districts to participate in typical pilot projects or the first batch of grassroots elections.

Some regions have adopted the method of convening cadre meetings of relevant departments by provincial-level organs or drawing cadres for centralized study to conduct preliminary training for cadres on general election work. The political and legal departments of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government have drawn 341 county- and district-level cadres for centralized study of documents related to the general election. In late April, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government drew the heads of civil affairs sections and civil affairs assistants from various counties for centralized training, and then organized them to participate in the typical pilot work of grassroots elections.

The content of training for grassroots election cadres in various localities mainly involves organizing them to study the relevant documents stipulated in the "Instructions of the Central Election Committee on Grassroots Election Work," as well as relevant common knowledge on handling population surveys and voter registration. The leaders of the Party and government leading organs in various localities attach great importance to this training work, personally giving them reports and answering questions. Wang Yilun, Deputy Secretary of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Director of the Civil Affairs Department and the Director of the Personnel Department of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government gave reports to the trainees of the grassroots election training class on the significance, steps, and methods of the general election. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

The work of training general election cadres in Jiangxi Province has begun comprehensively under the leadership of responsible comrades from Party committees and governments at all levels. The province's Fourth Civil Affairs Conference, which specifically discussed election issues, lasted for eighteen days and recently concluded. In addition to mainly determining the province's election work plan and steps, the conference also corrected many cadres' misconceptions about the meaning and methods of elections. Before the meeting, some cadres believed that elections were a meticulous and large-scale new task, and they lacked experience and were afraid of not doing well or making mistakes. Some did not have a sufficient understanding of the universality of the election law, thinking that the election law was "too broad" and fearing that fully exercising democracy would spoil the election work. Some emphasized that there was a "contradiction" between production and elections, and so on. After learning, discussing, and criticizing, a total of more than 150 specific problems were solved, improving cadres' understanding of the significance of elections and clarifying specific work methods, laying a favorable foundation for training election cadres and comprehensively carrying out election work throughout the province.

After the meeting, the cadres who participated in the meeting all went back to the special districts, counties, and districts to convey the spirit of the meeting, and obtained the attention of the leading comrades of the local Party committees and governments, and comprehensively began training cadres according to plan.

According to the central government's instructions, the Provincial Election Committee plans to train more than 39,000 cadres throughout the province according to the population ratio. The sources of training cadres are: cadres from special districts, counties, districts, and townships who are separated from production, with 40 from first-class counties, 35 from second-class counties, and 25 from third- and fourth-class counties. Most of these cadres are concentrated in special districts for key training, and will serve as team leaders of grassroots election work groups in the future. Another part is training cadres and technical cadres who are not separated from production, with a total of three phases of training. The training methods mainly include conferences and training classes. Around May 23rd, all six special districts and one special district in the province actively prepared for and began training the first batch of county and district cadres separated from production for grassroots general elections. Fuzhou Special District has drawn more than 260 cadres to begin training. Many counties have also actively prepared. Poyang County concentrated more than 290 district and township cadres and more than 100 technical cadres to begin training, planning to end by the end of May and conduct typical grassroots election experiments in 30 townships in three districts in early June. Leping County plans to conduct key experiments on general elections in 13 townships in the fourth district. Ganxian, Yushan, Qianshan and other counties have formulated county-level general election implementation plans based on their local actual conditions and production seasons. In order to make cadres throughout the province realize the great significance of general election work, actively participate in this work, and conduct propaganda earnestly, cadres throughout the province began studying the election law and related documents from the second half of May. Shao Shiping, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, made a mobilization report to more than 3,000 cadres in provincial-level organs on May 22nd. Responsible comrades from some special districts, counties, and cities have also given reports to cadres. (Wang Kunshan Yu Mingchun)

    各地集中训练担任基层选举工作的干部
    各地为迎接即将开始的基层选举工作，正在抽调大批准备担任选举工作的指导干部和技术人员集中进行训练。
    各地对于参加选举工作的干部的训练，大都是按照当地开展基层选举运动的步骤分批进行，其中参加典型试办和第一批基层选举的干部目前正在集中训练，或即将开始训练，许多省、市并拟订好参加第二批或第三批基层选举的干部的训练计划。山东省完成第一批基层选举所需要的约七千名指导干部和五千多名技术人员，即将开始训练，要求在六月中旬训练完毕，第二批基层选举时需补充的一万零五百多名指导干部和六千七百多名技术人员，预计在九月上旬可训练完毕。东北区吉林、松江、旅大等省、市已训练好七百八十多名干部，其他省、市也准备从五月中旬到七月中旬这一期间进行训练。河南省第一批指导基层选举的五百八十七名干部的训练工作，已在五月下旬开始。甘肃省由省级机关抽调参加基层选举工作的一千四百多名干部，已在五月十日、十六日分两批开始学习。
    有些省、市参加基层选举干部的训练工作已经完毕，这些经过训练的干部已经或即将到典型试办地区进行实验。上海市、济南市、陕西省等地正在参加基层选举典型试办工作的干部，事前都经过了训练。重庆市第一批指导基层选举的四百名干部五月底即可训练完毕，成都市参加第一批基层选举的指导干部和技术人员八百多名也已经训练完毕，他们将被分配到各区，参加典型试办或第一批基层选举。
    有些地区采取由省级机关召开有关部门的干部会议或抽调干部集中学习的方式，对干部进行关于普选工作的初步训练。贵州省人民政府政法部门已抽调县、区级干部三百四十一人集中学习有关普选的文件。青海省人民政府在四月下旬就抽调了各县民政科长和区民政助理员集中训练，然后组织他们参加基层选举的典型试办工作。
    各地对基层选举干部进行训练的内容，大都是组织他们学习“中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示”中所规定的有关文件，以及有关办理人口调查和选民登记的业务常识。各地党政领导机关的负责人对这一训练工作都非常重视，亲自给他们作报告和解答问题。中共松江省委员会副书记王一伦以及松江省人民政府民政厅长、人事厅长曾分别向基层选举训练班学员作了有关普选的意义、步骤、方法等问题的报告。（据新华社讯）
    江西省训练普选干部的工作，已在各级党委和政府负责同志领导下全面开始。专门讨论选举问题的省第四次民政会议开了十八天，已于最近结束。这次会议除主要确定了全省选举工作的计划和步骤外，还纠正了很多干部对选举意义与选举方法的很多错误认识。会前，有的干部认为选举是一件细致的规模巨大的新工作，没有经验，害怕做不好，出岔子；有的对选举法的普遍性认识不足，认为选举法规定“太宽”，怕充分发挥了民主反而会把选举工作搞坏；有的强调生产与选举有“矛盾”等等。经过学习、讨论、批判，先后一共解决了一百五十多个具体问题，提高了干部对选举意义的认识，明确了具体工作方法，给全省训练选举干部、全面开展选举工作打下了有利的基础。
    会后，参加会议的干部都回去在专、县、区进行了传达，并取得当地党委、政府领导同志的重视，全面按计划开始训练干部。
    省选举委员会根据中央指示，计划在全省内按人口比例训练三万九千多名干部。训练干部的来源是：脱离生产的专、县、区、乡干部，规定甲等县四十人，乙等县三十五人，丙等和丁等县各二十五人。这些干部大部集中在专区进行重点训练，将来要担任基层选举工作组长。另一部分是训练不脱离生产的干部与技术干部，总共分三期进行训练。训练的方法，主要有会议和训练班两种。五月二十三日左右，全省六个专区和一个特别区均已积极准备和开始训练第一批基层普选的县区脱离生产干部。抚州专区已抽调了二百六十余名干部开始训练。很多县也已积极准备。鄱阳县集中了二百九十余名区乡干部和百余名技术干部，开始训练，计划五月底结束，六月初在三个区的三十个乡进行基层选举典型试验。乐平县计划在第四区十三个乡进行普选的重点试验。赣县、玉山、铅山等县都根据当地实际情况与生产季节订出了县的普选实施计划。为了使全省干部认识普选工作的伟大意义，积极参加这一工作，认真进行宣传，全省干部已从五月下半月开始学习选举法和有关文件。省人民政府邵式平主席在五月二十二日向省级机关三千余名干部作了学习动员报告。有些专区和县、市的负责同志也向干部作了报告。（王昆山  于明春）
