Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 25th: The health of the returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army sick and wounded prisoners of war is gradually recovering. Due to the abuse they suffered at the hands of the American aggressors, when they first returned to the motherland, they were all sallow and emaciated, with sunken eyes and cheeks, and weak limbs. Some patients felt dizzy as soon as they stood up, and their eyes were unable to see far. They were mainly deficient in Vitamin A, which fully demonstrates their extreme lack of nutrition. The vast majority suffered from indigestion, and more than half had unhealthy respiratory systems, with bronchitis being very common, and many also suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Some still had shrapnel fragments in their heads and bodies. Many were amputated and disabled, and some wounds sustained in 1950 had not yet healed.

After returning to the motherland, the sick and wounded have begun to gradually recover their health after more than ten days of careful recuperation and medical treatment in hospitals. Now, their complexions are gradually becoming rosy, and their spirits are much better. They often take walks and sing freely. Their eating and sleeping habits are good, and the symptoms of their respiratory systems are gradually improving. Thanks to the doctors' conscientious treatment, the fevers of those with high temperatures have gradually subsided, and the wounds of the injured have stopped festering. According to a recent hospital survey, the returned sick and wounded have gained an average of two pounds in weight in the past ten days.

The hospital is now continuing to study ways to strengthen nutrition, so as to enable the sick and wounded to increase their strength more quickly, and then provide key medical treatment to those with more serious injuries or special symptoms.

    被遣返的志愿军病伤人员健康逐渐恢复
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】被遣返的中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员的健康正在逐渐恢复中。他们由于受了美国侵略者的虐待，在初回到祖国时，个个都是面黄肌瘦，两眼和两颊都深陷下去，四肢软弱无力。有的病员一起立就头晕，眼睛无力远视。他们主要是缺乏维他命甲，这充分说明他们极度缺乏营养。他们绝大部分都患消化不良症，半数以上的人呼吸系统都不健康，患支气管炎的非常普遍，许多人还患肺结核症。有的头部、身体中还残留着弹片。很多人被截肢残废，有的在一九五零年受伤的伤口到现在尚未痊愈。
    病伤人员们回到祖国以后，十多天来，经过医院的尽力调养和医疗，健康开始逐渐恢复。现在，他们的脸色正渐渐红润起来，精神也好得多了。他们经常散步走动，自由地歌唱。他们的饮食、睡眠的情况都很好；呼吸系统的症状逐渐好转。由于医生们的认真治疗，发高热的人的热度已渐渐下降，伤员的创口也已停止化脓。据医院最近调查，十多天来，被遣返的病伤人员的体重已平均增加了二磅。
    医院现正继续研究加强营养，使病伤人员们更加迅速增加体力，然后对负伤较重或症状特殊者进行重点医疗。
