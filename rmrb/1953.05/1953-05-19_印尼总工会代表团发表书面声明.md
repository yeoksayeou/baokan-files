Xinhua News Agency, May 18th—The Indonesian General Confederation of Labor delegation, invited to our country to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration and the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union, issued a written statement to our agency's reporter before leaving Beijing to visit the Northeast and other places. The full text is as follows:

    The vicious propaganda of imperialism and its pawns in Indonesia cannot hide the truth; China is progressing rapidly.

    Due to the adverse consequences of the U.S. imperialist war economy on life, such as soaring prices of necessities, increased unemployment, and the bankruptcy of national industrial and commercial enterprises caused by the embargo against the People's Republic of China, the Indonesian workers and the Indonesian people have always been watching and pinning their hopes on the struggle of the Chinese workers and the Chinese people. The Chinese workers and Chinese people, who have liberated themselves from the oppression of the Kuomintang and landlord groups, are now entering a turning point in history, and they are beginning to implement the Five-Year Plan to transform Chinese society to a higher stage.

    The Indonesian General Confederation of Labor delegation feels honored and proud to have accepted the invitation of the Chinese working class to participate in the celebration of "May Day"—the International Workers' Day of solidarity and friendship—and to attend the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union held during the First Five-Year Plan.

    The Indonesian General Confederation of Labor delegation has personally witnessed the leaping progress of Chinese society: the workers' living standards are improving day by day, prices are falling day by day, production is increasing, there are newly built and beautiful workers' dormitories, and the peasants are living happily in the countryside after the implementation of land reform. We are also firmly convinced of the Chinese people's enthusiasm for defending peace, as manifested in their various efforts for peace in Korea.

    The spirit of the Chinese working class to labor for the benefit of the motherland, their class friendship, and the enthusiasm for defending peace burning in the hearts of every Chinese son and daughter are a great encouragement to the Indonesian workers and the Indonesian people who are facing the war plans of U.S. imperialism and its pawns.

    Together with the Chinese workers, the Chinese people, and the workers all over the world under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Indonesian General Confederation of Labor delegation firmly believes that the struggle to improve living standards and to strive for complete national independence, democracy, and peace will surely be victorious.

    Long live the heroic Chinese workers! We wish the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese workers and the Indonesian workers!

    Long live the solidarity of the workers all over the world under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions!

    印尼总工会代表团发表书面声明
    【新华社十八日讯】应邀前来我国参加“五一”国际劳动节庆祝大会和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的印尼总工会代表团，在离北京赴东北等地参观访问前对本社记者发表书面声明，全文如下：
    帝国主义及其爪牙在印尼的恶毒宣传并不能掩盖真理，中国正在迅速地进步。
    由于生活上受到美帝国主义战争经济的恶果，例如生活必需品价格高涨，失业人数增加，对中华人民共和国实行禁运而引起的民族工商业破产等等，所以印尼工人、印尼人民始终是注视着并且把他们的希望寄托在中国工人、中国人民的斗争上。从国民党、地主集团压迫下解放了自己的中国工人和中国人民现在正进入历史的转折点，他们开始实行了把中国社会转变到更高阶段的五年计划。
    印尼总工会代表团感到荣幸和骄傲，因为我们接受中国工人阶级的邀请来参加庆祝“五一”劳动节——国际工人团结友爱的节日的大会，并且出席了在第一次五年计划期间召开的中国工会第七次全国代表大会。
    印尼总工会代表团亲眼看到中国社会的飞跃进步：工人的生活日益提高，物价日益降低，生产增加，新建的优美的工人宿舍，实行了土地改革后的乡村里农民的幸福生活。我们也坚信中国人民保卫和平的热情，这表现在他们为了和平而在朝鲜所做的种种努力上。
    中国工人阶级为祖国的利益而劳动的精神和他们的阶级友爱，以及燃烧在每个中国儿女的心胸中的保卫和平的热情，对于面对着美帝国主义及其爪牙的战争计划的印尼工人和印尼人民是一个很大的鼓舞。
    与中国工人、中国人民以及世界工联领导下的全世界工人一起，印尼总工会代表团坚信：为了改善生活，为了争取完全的民族独立、民主与和平的斗争必然会获得胜利。
    英勇的中国工人万岁！预祝第一个五年计划的胜利完成！
    中国工人与印尼工人的友谊万岁！
    世界工联领导下的全世界工人的团结万岁！
