Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions continued its plenary session on the morning of the 6th, hearing speeches from seven delegates and accepting friendly congratulations from trade union representatives from the German Democratic Republic, India, Indonesia, and Hungary. The executive chairmen of the meeting were: Li Jiebo, Hu Yaobang, Zhong Min, Yang Zhihua, and Jin Zhifu.

The seven delegates who spoke at the morning session were: Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League; Lan Tian, Captain of the Tiancheng Railway Engineering Survey Team and National Railway Labor Model; Du Yanqing, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions; Hong Ze, Second Deputy Director of the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Shen Guiying, Worker and Labor Model of the Yuhua Cotton Mill in Wuhan; Zhao Guoqiang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Metal and Smelting Workers' Union; and Yang Zhenben, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions. In their speeches, they all agreed with the reports of Lai Ruoyu, Xu Zhizhen, and Li Zaiwen. They reported on the great achievements of workers in different regions and different industries in the country's economic recovery and construction work, and resolutely expressed their determination to work hard to implement the policies and tasks formulated by the Congress.

Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, first spoke at the Congress, expressing his warm respect to the Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and wishing the Congress a successful conclusion. Hu Yaobang said that Chinese youth have a deep admiration for the Chinese working class. The heroic spirit and selfless labor of the Chinese working class constantly inspires Chinese youth to bravely advance for the motherland.

Hu Yaobang then said that with the development of China's industry, the Chinese working class is growing stronger, and the proportion of young workers is also increasing. At present, there are about six million young workers in the country, of which about 1.5 million are industrial young workers. Since last year, young people have accounted for more than half of the workers recruited by newly built and expanded state-owned factories and mines. Chinese youth are a strong reserve force for China's industrial construction, and they will continue to actively join the great ranks of the working class.

Hu Yaobang narrated the labor achievements of advanced figures among young workers, and then focused on explaining the tasks of the Youth League organizations in factories and mines. Hu Yaobang said that the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League is working hard to strengthen the work of the Youth League on the industrial front. At present, there are 650,000 Youth League members in factories and mines. The Youth League organizations in factories and mines must deeply understand that their basic task is to mobilize Youth League members and unite young workers, engineering and technical personnel, staff, and all workers to fight for the completion and overfulfillment of the state production plan. Hu Yaobang asked the Youth League organizations to cooperate closely with the trade unions in these tasks and obtain their help. Hu Yaobang said that the Youth League organizations in factories and mines will vigorously support the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, mobilize all Youth League members and young people to work hard to realize the resolutions of the Congress.

Lan Tian, Captain of the Tiancheng Railway Engineering Survey Team and National Railway Labor Model, is an engineer who has worked on the railway for a long time. In his speech at the Congress, he described how he deeply realized the greatness of the Communist Party and its care and love for him from his own experience, and how he learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and saved the country 12,000 billion yuan in construction costs with the support of the masses. He said that although he is already sixty-six years old, he feels that he is getting younger and younger. He expressed his determination to resolutely study politics, improve himself, overcome various shortcomings brought from the old society, resolutely learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to join the Communist Party of China with practical actions. At the Congress, he raised his hand and swore to Chairman Mao: He must complete the survey and design tasks assigned to him by the country as soon as possible and as well as possible, and fight to accelerate the realization of national industrialization. The audience burst into warm applause, welcoming the old engineer's speech and welcoming his firm determination to serve the people wholeheartedly.

Du Yanqing, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the significant achievements of workers in the Northwest in production and construction. He said that industry in the Northwest has rapidly recovered and developed on an extremely backward foundation. The opening of the Tianlan Railway, the economic artery of the Northwest, the intensified construction of the Lanxin Railway, the exploration of mineral deposits throughout the Northwest, and the successive start of construction of new factories, all present a beautiful vision of China's industrialization in the Northwest. He said that workers of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, organized in unified trade unions, have universally launched labor competitions and have achieved significant results. The workers of the Yumen Oilfield, who have overfulfilled their plans every year, are playing a leading role in the competition. Du Yanqing, on behalf of the Northwest trade union delegation, guaranteed to bring the resolutions and spirit of the Congress to the workers in the Northwest and fight for the realization of national industrialization and for the development of industrial production in the Northwest.

Hong Ze, Second Deputy Director of the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, extended warm congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the four million workers in the East China region, and paid tribute to the representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions and trade union representatives from various countries who came from afar to attend the Congress. After describing the increase in industrial production in East China and the fundamental changes in the appearance of many factories, he pointed out that the potential strength of the existing industrial base in East China is extremely great. He said that in the future, they will focus on mobilizing the masses in factories and mines to make full use of existing equipment, constantly tap potential capabilities, accumulate funds for the country, and cultivate a large number of technical and management cadres among workers, in order to strive to complete the country's construction plan.

Shen Guiying, a labor model of the Yuhua Cotton Mill in Wuhan, described the vivid facts of her continuous progress and improvement in production, life, and politics, technology, and other aspects under the education of the Party and the trade union. She expressed her determination to actively participate in labor competitions with all workers, consolidate labor discipline, and increase labor productivity with practical actions, accumulate more funds for national construction, and complete and overfulfill the tasks of national construction.

Zhao Guoqiang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Metal and Smelting Workers' Union, introduced the development of China's metal and smelting industry and the improvement of the material and cultural life of metal and smelting workers. He said that since liberation, under the education of the Communist Party, the metal and smelting workers have undergone a series of social reform movements, launched enthusiastic production competitions, and learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, which has enabled the metal and smelting industry to rapidly recover and develop. In 1952, the output of pig iron reached 105% of the highest output in history, and steel ingots reached 170%. Under the original equipment conditions, a large number of high-quality steels and various steel products that China had never produced in the past were produced to meet the needs of the country. He expressed his determination to strengthen the organization of the metal and smelting workers' union in order to mobilize the masses and strive to ensure the completion of the first Five-Year Plan. Zhao Guoqiang said: The iron and steel industry and the non-ferrous metal industry are the foundation of my country's industrialization, and the tasks of the metal and smelting workers are very important. All employees are full of confidence and determined to fight unremittingly for the victory of the Five-Year Plan.

Yang Zhenben, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions, explained the prosperity and development that the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved in all aspects under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The ranks of the working class in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have quadrupled with the development of Inner Mongolia's economic construction. Yang Zhenben said that the workers of Inner Mongolia, like the workers in other regions of the country, are bravely and diligently building their motherland. In 1952, more than 80% of the employees participated in patriotic labor competitions and put forward more than 20,000 rationalization proposals. Many advanced experiences have emerged in the forestry industry, transportation industry, and other fields. The lives of workers in Inner Mongolia have been greatly improved. Yang Zhenben expressed that he would conscientiously implement the resolutions of the Congress, unite the vast number of workers in the entire autonomous region, and strive to complete the national construction plan.

The speeches of Hu Yaobang and other seven representatives were warmly welcomed by the representatives.

At the morning session, Konrad, head of the trade union delegation of the German Democratic Republic, S.N. Banerjee, President of the All-India Labour Association, Zhu Yiduo, head of the Indonesian Trade Union Delegation, and Erno Szanto, head of the Hungarian Trade Union Delegation, delivered speeches to the Congress. They conveyed the congratulations and respect of the workers of their countries to the Congress, and unanimously expressed their desire to further strengthen the friendly unity with the Chinese working class. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

Konrad, head of the trade union delegation of the German Democratic Republic and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Free German Trade Union Federation, extended warm combat greetings to the Congress on behalf of 5.5 million trade union members and the progressive working people of all of Germany, and expressed the support of the German people for the peaceful proposals of China, North Korea, and the Soviet Union on the realization of an armistice in Korea. Konrad said that the tireless efforts of the Chinese people in striving for an armistice in Korea, and the great achievements of the Chinese people in the cause of national liberation, are an example for the German people, and greatly encourage the German people to strengthen the struggle to establish a unified, peace-loving, independent, and democratic Germany. Konrad said that under the leadership of the workers' party—the German Socialist Unity Party—the struggle of the German people to strive for national reunification is mainly against the provocations and arrogant policies of the American puppet government in West Germany, and against the military treaty by which American monopoly groups attempt to exploit and enslave the people of West Germany for a long time. Konrad said: The Free German Trade Union Federation is concentrating its efforts to complete the 1953 national economic plan and the Five-Year Plan, in order to lay the foundation for the construction of socialism. The Free German Trade Union Federation supports the struggle of the working people of West Germany and West Berlin to achieve their just social demands, and it clarifies to the working people of West Germany that building socialism is the only correct path to improving the material and cultural conditions of the working people and defending peace.

S.N. Banerjee, President of the All-India Labour Association, extended warm greetings to the delegates and the Chinese working people. Speaking of the struggle of the Indian working people, he emphasized the need to strive to organize a strong, united, free, and democratic trade union movement. He advocated further strengthening the long-standing friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian peoples. He emphasized that the Chinese and Indian peoples must work hard for lasting world peace.

Zhu Yiduo, head of the Indonesian Trade Union Delegation and First Secretary of the Organization Department of the Indonesian Trade Union Federation, extended friendly congratulations to the Chinese workers on behalf of the Indonesian workers, congratulating the Chinese workers in the largest country in Asia for being able to decide their own destiny and carry out large-scale peaceful construction. He said: The Indonesian workers firmly believe that the unity of the Chinese workers under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the unity of the working class all over the world will support the Indonesian workers in their struggle to improve their lives, strive for complete national independence, and lasting world peace. Zhu Yiduo detailed the evils caused by imperialist aggression to the Indonesian working people and the struggle of the Indonesian people. He emphasized the importance of the unity of the Indonesian workers, the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the assistance of brother trade unions all over the world to the Indonesian workers' movement. He finally wished the Congress great success and wished China's construction victory. He firmly believed that the success of China's planned construction would consolidate the peace camp and severely strike the war-mongering imperialist group.

Erno Szanto, head of the Hungarian Trade Union Delegation and Secretary of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions, expressed warm brotherly congratulations to the delegates and the Chinese working people on behalf of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions and the Hungarian working people. He praised the brilliant achievements of the new China in politics, economics, and culture. He said that the achievements of the Chinese people have great international significance. The Chinese people have set a shining and vivid example for the oppressed people all over the world who are struggling, and have strengthened and expanded the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. Erno Szanto said that in the eight years since liberation, the Hungarian people have undergone fundamental changes in the economic, political, social, and cultural fields. The Hungarian people are using their creativity and all their talents to realize the great plan to build Hungary. In Hungary, labor has become a glorious thing, and a large number of new labor heroes are emerging in the labor competition. He said that the Hungarian working people are actively participating in the worldwide movement to strive for peace, democracy, and the realization of socialism. The Hungarian people want to take the brave Chinese people with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm as an example, and strive to give selfless assistance to the Korean people in their heroic struggle to liberate themselves and oppose the American aggressors.

At the morning session, the trade union delegation of the German Democratic Republic presented gifts such as film projectors to the Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions continued in the afternoon of the 6th. The executive chairmen of the Congress were Kang Yonghe, Fan Yong, Li Zaiwen, Wallis, and Hong Ze.

Those who spoke at the afternoon session included Liu Changsheng, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions; Kang Yonghe, Director of the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Liu Ziju, Minister of Culture and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Zhao Qingfu, Deputy Director of Xiaofengman Power Plant; Wu Meisheng, First Deputy Director of Shanghai Wusong Machine Factory; Zhong Min, First Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions; Liu Changfu, Deputy Director of the Wire Rod Department of Tianjin Steel Plant and Tianjin Labor Model; Cai Shubin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Electricity Workers' Union; and Fu Hongbin, Head of the Administrative Group of Tianjin Construction Company and Labor Model. They expressed warm congratulations to the Congress and unanimously agreed with the reports of Lai Ruoyu, Xu Zhizhen, and Li Zaiwen at the Congress.

Liu Changsheng, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, made a speech at the Congress endorsing the holding of the Third World Trade Union Congress by the World Federation of Trade Unions. He put forward three proposals to the Congress: First, it is suggested that the Congress adopt a resolution endorsing the Third World Trade Union Congress and stipulate that all delegates should convey the resolutions and appeals of the World Federation of Trade Unions regarding the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress to the broad masses of workers. Second, it is suggested that the Congress mobilize the masses of workers to greet the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress with practical actions to strive to complete and overfulfill the national construction plan. Third, it is suggested that the Congress elect outstanding trade union workers and labor models in production as representatives to attend the Third World Trade Union Congress. Liu Changsheng also suggested that while the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation led by Louis Saillant is in China, they should discuss with trade union representatives from various countries specific methods and steps to strengthen the preparation for the Third World Trade Union Congress, and elect a delegation with broad representation to attend the Congress.

Kang Yonghe, Director of the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the workers of North China vowed to respond to the call of the Congress with practical actions, prepare to accept all new missions, and welcome the glorious task at the beginning of the country's industrialization. He said that the North China workers' movement, under the leadership of the Communist Party, inherited the glorious tradition in history and achieved significant achievements during the period of national economic recovery and transformation. A large number of advanced figures have emerged, and the working conditions, material, and cultural living conditions of the workers have been continuously improved. The trade union has basically played the role of a link between the Communist Party and the working masses and has become a strong pillar of the people's government. Kang Yonghe said that on this basis, the trade union is further mobilizing all workers to formulate a good production plan and has strengthened its work in capital construction, beginning to shoulder the major tasks of the new era.

Liu Ziju, Minister of Culture and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, reported to the Congress on the work of the trade union in culture and education since the Sixth National Labor Congress and the direction of the future efforts of the trade union in culture and education. He said that the mass cultural and educational work of self-transformation and self-education is one of the important tasks of the trade union as a communist school. In the past few years, the cultural and educational work of the Chinese trade union, in accordance with the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, has conducted education on current affairs and the policies of the Communist Party, and systematic communist education among the broad masses of workers during various movements. 1,464,400 people nationwide have received this kind of education. The trade union has conducted production propaganda and spare-time technical education. At present, there are 477,000 employees nationwide participating in spare-time technical studies. The trade union has carried out cultural education, eliminating illiteracy among 60% to 80% of the workers, establishing 16,270 spare-time cultural literacy schools for employees nationwide, with 3,087,000 students. The trade union has carried out cultural and recreational activities. In the railway industrial trade union alone, 300,000 employees participated in various sports groups, and 500,000 employees nationwide participated in spare-time art groups. The trade union trained trade union cadres. In the past few years, 110,000 trade union cadres have been trained by trade union schools in various places. This series of work has unprecedentedly increased the level of awareness of the working masses, thereby powerfully promoting mass political movements and patriotic labor competitions. He said that the shortcomings of the cultural and educational work in the past are mainly manifested in the lack of political and ideological strength, the unclear view of serving production, the weak mass viewpoint, and the lack of a realistic and thorough work style. These shortcomings have now been basically corrected. He said that in the future, the cultural and educational work of the trade union should strive to strengthen the education of the masses of employees on national industrialization, educate the broad masses of employees to sincerely learn from the Soviet Union, systematically eliminate illiteracy among the masses of employees, correctly use cultural and educational funds, coordinate with the organizational departments of the trade union, systematically train a large number of trade union cadres, and more deeply and more widely educate the masses of employees on resisting America and aiding Korea and defending world peace.

Zhao Qingfu, Deputy Director of Xiaofengman Power Plant in Northeast China, described in his speech the process by which he, an ordinary worker with a low level of education, actively overcame difficulties, painstakingly studied technology, and finally became an engineer. He said that the restoration and construction of the Xiaofengman Power Plant promoted his learning. The trade union education under the leadership of Chairman Mao helped him to continuously increase his confidence in overcoming difficulties. In the future, he will work harder with everyone to learn various advanced Soviet technologies to complete the construction tasks assigned to the motherland.

Wu Meisheng, First Deputy Director of Shanghai Wusong Machine Factory, said in his speech that he was originally a lathe worker who had worked for 44 years. Thanks to the continuous education and training of the Communist Party and the trade union, he became the deputy director of the factory. He was unspeakably happy to be elected as a representative to participate in this Congress. He said that this Congress made him more aware of the great historical task of the working class in the process of realizing national industrialization, and recognized the great significance of completing and overfulfilling the national plan.

Zhong Min, First Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said that after the liberation of Shanghai, the Shanghai workers assisted the people's government in taking over the huge bureaucratic capitalist enterprises and carried out arduous economic recovery and transformation work. Now, Shanghai's industrial production has recovered and partially exceeded the highest level before the war, and the lives of the workers have also been significantly improved. Zhong Min said that according to the new tasks of the national construction period, they must strive to strengthen trade union construction, continuously improve the level of awareness and organization of the working masses, criticize and overcome the one-sided welfare views existing in some enterprises on the basis of class consciousness, and mobilize the vast number of workers to give full play to the potential of industry to complete the national construction plan.

Liu Changfu, Deputy Director of the Wire Rod Department of Tianjin Steel Plant and Labor Model of Tianjin, introduced the outstanding achievements and valuable work experience of the Liu Changfu model group in his speech. In 1952, their group planned to increase production and save 7 billion yuan for the country, but actually completed 19.2 billion yuan. Their group created the experience of implementing a group economic accounting system. They have now started working in a newly built semi-automated rolling mill. Liu Changfu said that they know that this year is the first year of the country's planned construction, and everyone is determined to work harder, strive to complete the national construction plan ahead of schedule, and strive for the early realization of socialism.

Cai Shubin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Electricity Workers' Union, said that in the past three years, with the help of Soviet experts, the national electricity production has completely changed its face, and has continuously completed and overfulfilled the state's tasks. In terms of production, in the past three years, without adding any equipment, the power generation has increased by 150%, the electricity sales have increased by 2.8 times, and the equipment utilization rate has increased to 49%, which is 93.2% more than in 1949. In terms of reducing costs, 330,000 tons of coal were saved for the country in 1950 and 1951 alone. In terms of basic construction, taking the completion volume in 1950 as 100, it was 462% in 1952, and the total investment in 1953 increased by 440% compared with last year. In many units of the power generation, transmission, fuel, and distribution systems, there have been glorious records and advanced experiences of safe and accident-free operations. The "Scientific Safe Operation Method" that has been systematically summarized has been steadily promoted nationwide. On the basis of developing production, the working conditions, material, and cultural life of electricity workers have also been greatly improved. Cai Shubin said with confidence and enthusiasm that the national electricity workers are now striving to complete the various indicators of the 1953 plan ahead of schedule.

Fu Hongbin, a labor model of Tianjin Construction Company, reported on how construction workers have improved their awareness, created new working methods, and improved work efficiency after liberation. He said that at the time when the country's large-scale economic construction has begun, construction workers know the importance of their responsibilities and are determined to unite all employees, work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, further tap potential forces, strengthen labor discipline, and overcome all difficulties. He said that in order to respond to the construction union's call for "good," "fast," "economical," and "safe," their group has formulated specific plans to improve production efficiency, reduce materials, and ensure quality.

The speeches of Liu Changsheng, Kang Yonghe, Liu Ziju, and other nine representatives were warmly welcomed by the whole audience. Liu Changsheng's three suggestions were particularly welcomed by all the representatives, and the audience burst into thunderous applause.

At the afternoon session, Marcel Dufrich, representative of the French General Confederation of Labor and member of the Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor, Deqin Laizui, head of the Burmese Trade Union Delegation and Vice Chairman of the All-Burma Trade Union Congress, Istrat Nicolae, head of the Romanian Trade Union Delegation and member of the Presidium of the Central Council of Romanian Trade Unions, and A.E. Goonesinha, head of the Ceylonese Trade Union Delegation and Secretary-General of the Ceylon Labour Union Federation, delivered speeches in succession. They paid tribute to the Congress and the Chinese workers on behalf of the workers of their countries, and wished the Congress a successful conclusion. They praised the achievements of the new China in peaceful construction and China's peace policy, and believed that the victory of the Chinese people was a great encouragement to them. The speeches of these foreign trade union representatives were deeply welcomed by the representatives.

Marcel Dufrich, representative of the French General Confederation of Labor and member of the Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor, said that this Congress is a major event for China and for the entire international trade union movement. The French workers are enthusiastically watching the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people. The victory of the Chinese people has inspired the French workers to fight against poverty and fascism. He explained in detail the evils caused by economic militarization and war policies in France. He said that the French people, led by the working class, are fighting. They do not want to suffer from poverty, do not want fascism, and do not want war. The French working class combines their economic struggles with the struggle to defend peace. They oppose the French government's dirty war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He expressed the deep concern of the French workers for the Vietnamese people to the Vietnamese delegation present. At the end of Dufrich's speech, the Vietnamese trade union representative stepped forward and embraced him amidst warm applause from the audience, thanking the French working class and the French people for their friendship and support.

Deqin Laizui, head of the Burmese Trade Union Delegation and Vice Chairman of the All-Burma Trade Union Congress, said that the material and cultural lives of the Burmese people are deteriorating due to the cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism. The Burmese workers are fighting for better living and working conditions, for national independence, peace and democracy, and for unified action of workers. The Burmese working people know that their struggle is not isolated, but is receiving enthusiastic support from the working people of all countries. The Burmese people know that the movement of workers to defend their economic rights is inseparable from the struggle for national independence, peace and democracy. Today, the Burmese people are working with peace-loving people all over the world to fight for peace.

Istrat Nicolae, head of the Romanian Trade Union Delegation and member of the Presidium of the Central Council of Romanian Trade Unions, said that the Romanian people watch with love and praise the various achievements made by the Chinese people. In a short period of time, the Chinese people have transformed a country that was not long ago ruled by imperialists into a free country with rapid industrial recovery and development. He said that the Romanian people are achieving significant victories in the cause of building socialism. The Romanian working people are working with enthusiasm to complete and overfulfill the national plan for 1953 - a year of decisive significance for the completion of the Five-Year Plan within four years. The first quarter of 1953 has completed 101.1% of the plan. He said that the Romanian people fully support the struggle of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and firmly support the proposals of the Chinese government and the North Korean government on the Korean armistice issue, believing that this proposal is of great significance for defending and consolidating the cause of world peace.

    中华全国总工会文教部部长刘子久，向大会报告了第六次全国劳动大会以来工会文教工作的情况及今后工会文教工作努力的方向。他说，实行自我改造和自我教育的群众文教工作，是作为共产主义学校的工会的重要工作之一。几年来中国工会的文教工作，本着毛泽东同志的指示，在各种运动中向广大职工群众进行了关于时事和共产党的政策的教育，进行了系统的共产主义的教育，全国受到这种教育的有一百四十六万四千人。工会进行了生产宣传和业余技术教育，现在全国参加业余技术学习的职工有四十七万七千人。工会进行了文化教育，扫除了工人群众中的百分之六十到八十的文盲，全国建立职工业余文化补习学校一万六千二百七十所，学员三百零八万七千人。工会开展了文化娱乐活动，仅铁路一个产业工会就有三十万职工参加了各种体育小组，全国参加业余文艺小组的职工达五十万人。工会训练了工会的干部，几年来由各地工会学校训练出来的工会干部有十一万人。这一系列的工作，使职工群众的觉悟程度空前提高了，从而有力地推动了群众性的政治运动和爱国主义的劳动竞赛。他说，文教工作过去存在的缺点，主要表现在政治性思想性不强，为生产服务的观点不明确，群众观点薄弱和缺乏实事求是和贯彻到底的工作作风。这些缺点，现在已基本上得到了改正。他说，今后工会文教工作，要努力加强对于职工群众进行关于国家工业化的教育，教育广大职工群众诚心诚意地向苏联学习，有计划地扫除职工群众中的文盲，正确地使用文教经费，协同工会的组织部门，有计划地大量训练工会干部，并更深入地、更广泛地向职工群众进行关于抗美援朝和保卫世界和平的教育。

    上海总工会第一副主席钟民说，上海工人在上海解放以后，协助人民政府接管了庞大的官僚资本企业，进行了艰巨的经济恢复和改造工作。现在，上海工业生产已恢复并部分超过了战前最高水平，工人生活也已得到显著的改善。钟民说，根据国家建设时期的新任务，今后一定要努力加强工会建设，不断提高工人群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，在阶级自觉的基础上，批判和克服在某些企业中存在的片
    面福利观点，并动员广大职工发挥工业潜在能力，来完成国家建设计划。

    文化生活也大大改善了。蔡书彬满怀信心和热忱地说，全国电业工人现在正为争取提前完成一九五三年计划的各项指标而奋斗。
