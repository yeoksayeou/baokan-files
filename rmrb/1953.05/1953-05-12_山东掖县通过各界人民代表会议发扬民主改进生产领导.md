Editor's Note: The experience of Yexian County, Shandong Province, in promoting democracy and improving production leadership through people's representatives conferences is a relatively successful one. Its characteristics are: it practically, rather than formally, combined the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline with current work; it was prepared and purposeful, rather than holding meetings for the sake of holding meetings like a routine; it fully promoted democracy in the meetings, earnestly carried out criticism and self-criticism, rather than focusing on summarizing achievements and lengthy reports. This enables the people's representatives conferences to truly reflect the opinions of the masses, solve the problems of the masses, and improve the political enthusiasm of the representatives and the masses, and strengthen the connection between the Party and the People's Government and the masses. These experiences are worth referring to in other places and can be used as a reference for future people's congress work in various places.

    Yexian County, Shandong Province, convened its eighth first people's representatives conference before this year's spring plowing. This conference focused mainly on discussing and deploying spring production, and combined it with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. Due to relatively adequate preparations before the meeting, and the full promotion of democracy during the meeting, leading cadres first made self-criticisms, and commended good people and deeds, exposed and dealt with bad people and deeds; thus improving the political enthusiasm of the representatives, and making them seriously and responsibly put forward opinions and criticisms on government work; improving cadres, improving leadership, and changing work style; and democratically adopting the spring production work plan, and formulating various resolutions such as the county head regularly receiving people's visits, lending waterwheels, walking plows, and "six prohibitions" (no arbitrary apportionments, no arbitrary allocation of labor, no holding struggle sessions, no arbitrarily depriving the masses of their civil rights, no arbitrary beating or scolding people, no retaliation against critics), to ensure the smooth progress of this year's spring production work. The course and main experience of this conference are:

    1. Democratic Election of Representatives. The county began preparations for the people's representatives conference last winter. The representatives were democratically elected by the masses after a long period of deliberation based on the democratic movement. Among the previous representatives, 230 were removed because they could not perform their duties as representatives, had a coercive command style, or had violated laws and regulations, accounting for 64 percent of the total number of the previous representatives; 177 new representatives were elected, accounting for 58 percent of the total number of representatives attending this session. These representatives have very close relations with the masses. When the representatives went to the county for the meeting, many people sent them off outside the village, and repeatedly urged the representatives before parting: "Be sure to bring our opinions up, I heard that the county wants to change in the future." The representatives also felt honored and expressed that they would handle their own affairs with the attitude of masters, changing the past attitude of only "listening to reports," "receiving tasks," and "being guests."

    2. Clear Meeting Center. This meeting mainly grasped two links: one is production, and the other is democracy. In terms of production, it was not just about proposing increased production figures like in the past, but under the patriotic education of "winning both the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and production construction," it promoted democracy and focused on summarizing last winter's production; and based on the actual situation of the county, realistically and specifically studied the central task of taking spring plowing production as the overriding task, and proposed four measures to ensure timely sowing and a bumper wheat harvest: First, trample and hoe wheat, promote reasonable topdressing, and timely watering; Second, start early to rake and hoe spring land, deep plow and finely cultivate, loosen the soil, and ensure timely sowing; Third, exchange seeds for better varieties, soak seeds, and eliminate insects to protect seedlings; Fourth, advocate appropriate dense planting; maintain the status quo in the plains, and appropriately increase density in the mountainous areas. In addition, the government's work plan was discussed and approved, highlighting and effectively solving the problem of organizing to carry out spring plowing production, and clearly explaining policies and work methods. And around the center, typical demonstrations were organized, wheat high-yield model Chen Xingbang and Jiang Bingyao were invited to introduce their wheat high-yield experience and increase production plans, and Wu Yingbo was invited to introduce his harmonious family unity production situation. Through typical speeches, the content of the government's report was enriched, making it easier for the representatives to understand deeply. The report was simple and concise, with clear content, changing the past method of lengthy and empty "big reports," and eliminating the past phenomenon of "loud reports on the stage, and representatives sleeping off the stage." Therefore, there was enough time for the representatives to have panel discussions, and the problems solved were both the requirements of the representatives and the requirements of the masses. Therefore, throughout the entire meeting process, the representatives were very focused, acting nervously, emotionally full, and deeply impressed. They reflected: the leadership has begun to change, this meeting solves more problems than any other meeting, if such meetings are held a few more times, the work will be done better.

    3. The democratic spirit was implemented throughout the entire process, and democracy was fully promoted. This is the key to the success of the meeting, and it is also a guarantee for overcoming bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, so that the resolutions of the meeting can be correctly implemented. According to Yexian's experience, the first is that leading cadres modestly make self-criticisms to inspire representatives to boldly put forward opinions and criticisms; the second is to closely combine current work and carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. When deploying work, start with reviewing the compulsory orders and bureaucracy that occurred in past work, proceed from reality, take care of specific conditions, grasp key issues, concentrate efforts to clearly explain policies and work methods, and humbly listen to representatives' opinions. The last is to expose and deal with bad people and deeds, commend good people and deeds, and educate representatives and cadres with living people and living things. This meeting changed the past tendency to focus on praising achievements, and focused on carrying out criticism and self-criticism based on facts. First of all, the county's leadership took the lead and made a more serious and profound self-criticism at the meeting, criticizing the mistakes of forcing orders in several major tasks in the past year, which made good things bad, and not seriously and seriously dealing with violations of laws and disciplines; Reviewed the bureaucratic style of not understanding the situation below, not caring about the suffering of the masses, and the resulting consequences; Exposed the illegal and disciplinary actions of Song Chengye, the district head of Sanyuan District, who infringed on human rights and destroyed policies, and personally led the militia to hang and beat the masses; Commended the model deeds of Yin Jingshan, the head of Wuli Township in Shuangshan District, who led the migrant workers to repair the Nanyang River. Because the water was rushing and washing away the embankment, he lay on the embankment regardless of his own safety to block the water flow, repaired the river embankment, and avoided the flood. This clear contrast had a great enlightening and educational effect on the representatives, so that everyone carefully checked the government's work with the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people, eagerly spoke enthusiastically, and their emotions were high. Thirty-seven cases of forced orders and twenty-three cases of violations of law and discipline were subsequently exposed. The county leading organs concentrated the opinions of the representatives, announced the decision to punish Song Chengye, expressed their determination to correct bureaucracy and commandism in the future, praised the spirit of the representatives being responsible for the people, and guaranteed that they would immediately organize cadres to seriously deal with the bad people and bad things reported by the meeting in the future. The representatives also said: As long as the cadres can change, they guarantee to mobilize the masses to respond to the government's call, and do whatever is needed. Li Changrong, a representative from Xiyao Town, said: "I used to think: Although it is a new society now, the officials still protect each other, and this time I really know that the world now belongs to the people, and the government is doing things for the people." Cadres also reflected: "It's not enough to shout slogans, we must do our work carefully in the future." Finally, according to the representatives' proposal, three more resolutions were made: The first is that the county head will personally receive people's visits on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar calendar; The second is the resolution to lend waterwheels and walking plows; The third is the "six prohibitions" resolution to stop violations of law and discipline and protect human rights. After these resolutions were passed, the representatives' emotions were even higher, and they generally reflected: "Cadres break the law, and the common people come to discuss and deal with it, it is really a new society." Representative Wu Xingxiu said: "The better such meetings are held, the more good people and good deeds there will be, and the fewer bad people and bad deeds there will be." 4. Representatives conscientiously and responsibly convey the resolutions. After the meeting, the representatives went back and used the language of the masses to convey the resolutions in the streets and alleys where the masses gathered, especially the democratic situation at the meeting, which was conveyed more prominently, which greatly encouraged the masses and deeply educated the cadres. It made the compulsory order style and violations of law and discipline begin to stop, and made the connection between the Party and the government and the people closer. The cadres of Maojiazhuang Township in the thirteenth district originally planned to allocate a large amount of labor to build schools, but now they have stopped because the masses disagreed. Zhou Yuming, the branch secretary, said: "When things don't go smoothly and I'm about to get angry, I think of the 'six prohibitions', and I also think that nothing can be done badly if we discuss everything with the masses." This also improved the masses' idea of being the masters of their own affairs. Zhou Yuzhi said: "The 'six prohibitions' make me dare to speak, in the past, some township cadres said that cows were sheep, and no one dared to say that they were cows." Many people who have opinions on cadres go to the representatives to reflect them. Lu Zhongxian, the production committee member of Maojiazhuang Township, called on the masses to organize, but he did not participate in the mutual aid group; After the masses criticized him, he participated. He said: "Now it's not enough to just shout slogans and not do it yourself!"

    山东掖县通过各界人民代表会议发扬民主改进生产领导
    曲金海　陈垲  王建宽　曹孟品
    编者按：山东掖县通过各界人民代表会议发扬民主改进生产领导的经验，是一个比较成功的经验。它的特点在于：它是实际地而不是形式地结合当前工作开展了反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争；它是有准备、有目的地而不是像例行公事一样为开会而开会；在会议中充分发扬了民主，认真地开展了批评和自我批评，而不是偏重于总结成绩和连篇累牍的大报告。这样就使各界人民代表会议能真正反映群众意见，解决群众问题，并提高代表和群众的政治积极性，加强党和人民政府与群众的联系。这些经验值得其他地方参考，并可作为今后各地召开人民代表大会工作的参考。
    山东掖县在今年春耕前召开了该县八届一次各界人民代表会议。这次会议是以讨论和布置春季生产为主要中心，并结合开展反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争。由于在会前有比较充分的准备，会议中充分地发扬了民主，领导干部首先作了检讨，并表扬了好人好事，揭发与处理了坏人坏事；因而提高了代表们的政治积极性，对政府工作认真负责地提出了意见和批评；提高了干部，改进了领导，转变了工作作风；并民主通过了春季生产工作计划，制定了县长定期接待人民来访、贷放水车、步犁和“六不准”（不准乱摊派、不准乱拨工、不准开斗争会、不准随便褫夺群众公民权、不准随便打骂人、不准对批评者打击报复）等各项决议，保证了今年春季生产工作的顺利进行。这次会议的经过情形和主要经验是：
    一、民主产生代表。该县在去年冬天就开始了各界人民代表会议的准备工作。代表是在民主运动的基础上，经过较长时间的酝酿，由群众民主选举出来的。上届代表中，因不能履行代表职务和有强迫命令作风及违法乱纪行为而被选掉的有二百三十名，占上届代表总数百分之六十四；新选代表一百七十七名，占本届出席代表总数的百分之五十八。这些代表和群众的关系都很密切。代表们到县开会时，许多群众都送到村外，临别时还再三叮嘱代表：“一定把我们的意见带上去，听说县里往后想转变。”代表们也深感光荣，表示要以主人翁的态度来办自己的事，改变了过去那种专门“听报告”、“领任务”和“作客”的态度。
    二、会议中心明确。这次会议主要抓住两个环节：一个是生产，一个是民主。在生产方面，不像过去只是提出增产数字，而是在“抗美援朝和生产建设两胜利”的爱国主义教育下，发扬民主，重点地总结去冬生产；并根据该县实际情况，切实具体地研究了以春耕生产为压倒一切的中心工作，提出了保证适时播种和保证小麦丰收的四项措施：第一，踩压、锄小麦，提倡合理追肥，适时浇水；第二，早动手耙耢春地，深耕细刨，翻松土壤，保证适时播种；第三，换种浸种，灭虫保苗；第四，提倡适当密植；平原保持原状，山丘地带适当增密。此外还讨论通过了政府的工作计划，突出而切实地解决了组织起来开展春耕生产的问题，明确地交待了政策和工作方法。并且围绕中心组织了典型示范，请小麦丰产模范陈兴邦、姜秉耀介绍了自己的小麦丰产经验和增产计划，请吴英波介绍了自己的和睦家庭团结生产的情形。通过典型发言，充实了政府的报告内容，使代表们领会得比较深刻。报告简单扼要，内容明确，改变了过去那种冗长空洞的“大报告”方法，消除了过去“台上大声报告，代表台下睡觉”的现象。因而腾出了充分时间，让代表们座谈讨论，所解决的问题既是代表的要求，也是群众的要求。因此全部会议过程中，代表们的精神都很集中，行动紧张，情绪饱满，印象深刻。他们纷纷反映：领导开始转变了，这次会比任何一次会都解决问题，这样的会多开几次，工作就会作得更好。
    三、自始至终贯彻了民主精神，充分发扬了民主，这是会议成功的关键，也是克服官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象，使会议决议得以正确贯彻的保障。根据掖县经验，首先是领导干部虚心检讨，启发代表大胆提出意见和批评；其次是密切结合当前工作，开展反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪斗争。布置工作时从检讨过去工作中所发生的强迫命令、官僚主义入手，从实际出发，照顾具体条件，抓住重点问题，集中力量交代清楚政策和工作方法，虚心倾听代表意见。最后是揭发并处理坏人坏事，表扬好人好事，用活人活事教育代表和干部。这次会议改变了过去偏重于歌颂成绩的偏向，着重于实事求是地开展批评与自我批评。首先县的领导上以身作则，在会上作了比较认真、深刻的自我批评，批判了一年来在几件主要工作中由于强迫命令将好事办坏及对违法乱纪现象没有认真严肃处理的错误；检讨了不了解下情、不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义作风和因此造成的恶果；揭发了该县三元区区长宋成业侵犯人权、破坏政策，亲自率领民兵吊打群众的违法乱纪行为；表扬了双山区五里乡乡长殷景山带领民工抢修南阳河时，因水急冲堤，自己奋不顾身地躺在堤边挡住流水，修好河堤，免去水患的模范事迹。这种鲜明的对比对代表们的启发教育作用很大，使大家都抱着治病救人的态度仔细检查了政府工作，争先恐后地热烈发言，情绪高涨。又先后揭发出三十七件强迫命令和二十三件违法乱纪行为。县领导机关集中了代表们的意见，宣布了对宋成业的处分决定，表示了今后决心纠正官僚主义和命令主义作风，表扬了代表们为人民负责的精神，并保证今后马上组织干部认真处理会议检举出来的坏人坏事。代表们也表示：只要干部能转变，保证发动群众响应政府号召，作到要什么有什么。西繇镇代表李长荣说：“我以前总是想：现在虽是新社会，但还是‘官官相护’，这回才真正知道了现在天下是人民的，政府是为人民办事的。”干部也反映说：
    “空喊不行了，今后必须仔细地做好工作。”最后根据代表提议，又作了三项决议：第一是每逢农历初一、十五两天，县长亲自接见人民来访；第二是贷放水车和步犁的决议；第三是制止违法乱纪、保障人权的“六不准”决议。这些决议通过后，代表情绪更为高涨，普遍反映：“干部犯法，老百姓来讨论处理，真是新社会。”代表吴兴秀说：“这样的会议越开得好，好人好事就越多，坏人坏事就越少。”四、代表认真负责地传达决议。会后代表们回去，用群众的语言在街头巷尾群众聚集的场所进行传达，特别是对会议中发扬民主的情况，传达得更为突出，给群众的鼓舞很大，对干部的教育也很深。使强迫命令作风和违法乱纪行为开始停止下来，使党和政府与人民群众的联系更为密切。十三区毛家庄乡的干部原计划大拨工修学校，现在因群众不同意而停止了。支部书记周玉明说：“工作不顺利正要发火的时候，就想起了‘六不准’，同时也想到凡事与群众商量，没有做不好的。”这样也就提高了群众当家作主的思想。周玉芝说：“‘六不准’使我敢说话了，过去有的乡干部把牛说成羊，谁也不敢说是牛。”不少群众对干部有意见，都到代表那里去反映。毛家庄乡的生产委员吕中贤号召群众组织起来，他自己却不参加互助组；经群众提出批评后，他参加了。他说：“现在光空喊、自己不干，不行啦！”
