State-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine's geological drilling work suffers from numerous accidents and extremely poor quality due to a lack of responsibility. Specifically, from January to March 20, 1953 (inclusive, the same applies below), a total of six drilling rigs experienced 67 accidents. The time spent on accidents accounted for 71% of the total working time. Consequently, only 31.47% of the drilling plan was completed in the first quarter of this year (up to the 20th), with an average drilling cost of 341,000 yuan per meter (compared to approximately 60,000 yuan last year). The core recovery rate was only 64.37%, and the coal core recovery rate was only 9% (the recovery rate for conglomerate, sandstone, and sandy shale must be above 75%, with a minimum of 50%; the coal core recovery rate should reach 40%. If either of these rates is not met, the drilled hole is essentially useless). This means that although they drilled several hundred meters and extracted some rock and coal cores, they were still unable to determine the geological structure based on the obtained raw materials and produce cross-sectional diagrams to provide design data for the construction of new mines.

The emergence of this serious situation is primarily due to the fact that the technical personnel responsible for the drilling project did not conduct a detailed investigation of the inclination and orientation of the geological coalfield or study the mining conditions of the old mines before blindly designing the drilling locations. The director of the Mining Bureau responsible for drilling also blindly approved the designs, resulting in many incorrect drill holes. For example, during the restoration of the Dongda Well, two consecutive drill holes were drilled into the old mined-out areas. The collapse of rocks in the old areas trapped the drill pipes, rendering the holes useless. Some old workers said, "We told the engineering technicians and leading cadres that we had mined coal in this area before and suggested not drilling here, but they didn't believe us. Now, let them see!"

Secondly, there is no one responsible on the worksite. The personnel department doesn't know how many cadres and workers are involved in the drilling; the engineering and materials departments don't know how many machines there are. Many steel pipes and casings ordered from abroad are left in "open-air warehouses." Some steel pipes are used as water pipes, and no one is responsible for managing them. The most serious issue is that a very valuable Soviet-style salvage machine (used to deal with accident machines) recently allocated by the central government was disassembled, and its parts were scattered across various worksites throughout the Fengfeng Coal Mine. When Soviet experts visited the Fengfeng Coal Mine on March 10th, the drilling team searched the entire worksite but couldn't find all the parts of the salvage machine. Next to the drilling team's door, there are 190 meters of steel pipes, with 58 meters of casing on top, all rusted over one centimeter thick, and no one cares about them. When the inspection team from the Ministry of Fuel Industry inquired about this, the materials section said the engineering section knew, and the engineering section said the materials section knew. When they were brought together to ask, they replied, "We'll talk about it later!"

In this situation, accidents are bound to increase. On one occasion, the drill rod of drill hole 207 broke. Since the pipe grinding against the pipe is softer than grinding against rock, the workers thought they had encountered coal and diligently drilled on, drilling 19 meters until they couldn't drill any further. When they pulled up the pipe, they realized they had drilled 19 meters of steel pipe, and the drill hole was crooked. In this situation, the leading comrades of geological drilling should have humbly learned, delved into reality, relied on the workers, concentrated the wisdom of the masses, solved key problems, and led the masses to earnestly carry out the glorious cause entrusted to them by the country and the people. However, they were emotional, believing that drilling had no "future," or thinking, "Although I haven't done this before, I've worked in the coal mine for many years. What's so special about geological drilling!" Under the influence of such erroneous thinking, they naturally couldn't work diligently. Once, when a newspaper reporter asked Liu Chungeng, the director of the Fengfeng Geological Drilling Office, to help introduce the situation on the worksite, he casually said, "There are three drilling rigs drilling on the east side. Let's go take a look!" When they arrived at the first drilling tower, he first gave a signal—a cough—but the workers ignored him. When they went inside to look, the drilling rigs were all "sleeping," and the water pumps were also "separated." The workers told the reporter, "We're waiting because we're missing parts, and no one cares when we ask the leaders." Then they went to the second drilling tower. Liu Chungeng spoke loudly before even reaching the door to attract the workers' attention, but when they went inside, the drilling rigs were also "sleeping." The director was so angry that he asked the workers, "When did it break?" The workers said, "It's been broken for over twenty days. The pipes are almost impossible to pull out!" When they got to the third drilling tower, he first led the reporter to walk around outside before going in. At this time, they were taking core samples. He was very happy, but what came up was an empty pipe. The reporter asked, "How do you take core samples?" Everyone replied, "By bumping!" In reality, the director had no idea about the situation on the worksite. But the next day, he convened a general meeting of all workers and said, "Don't beat the diligent, don't beat the lazy, only beat those who don't open their eyes" (meaning workers should not lose face for him).

Under the above circumstances, the drilling quality became increasingly lower. In January, the rock core recovery rate was 78.17%, and the coal core recovery rate was 0.43%; by March, the rock core recovery rate was 40%, and no coal cores were recovered at all.

Secondly, the recovered rock and coal cores should be carefully recorded and numbered according to the order of layers, and then placed in core boxes with partitions for proper storage to prevent weathering and confusion, which would avoid judgment errors during design and lead to overall errors. However, the Geological Office assigned illiterate or poorly literate people to keep records, so they mistook shale and limestone for flint, and the cumulative depth was mostly different from the actual drilling depth. The core boxes had no partitions, and the cores rolled around and reversed the order of layers. This would cause calculation errors in future designs. The People's Daily criticized this issue as early as February 26th and pointed out ways to improve the work. But strangely, no one has paid attention to this matter until now.

The cause of this serious situation, according to some leading cadres, is "few cadres, lack of experience, low technology, many difficulties, and Fengfeng currently has no strength to overcome it." This is very wrong. Because this problem is a common problem in all departments of our country in the current large-scale construction, it cannot be used as an excuse for the poor geological drilling work in Fengfeng Mine. In fact, this is not entirely the case. Currently, the number of cadres on the drilling rigs has increased from the original six to more than sixty, and the Geological Office, the Drilling Engineering Team, and the Party, Labor Union, and Youth League organizations for geological drilling have been established. Can it be said that there are few cadres compared to the past? But why is the work even worse than before? Nationally, Fengfeng Mine was the first to promote the Soviet "mud drilling method" and created a new national record. In drill hole 503, the coal core recovery rate was over 63%. Can it be said that this is a difficulty that Fengfeng Coal Mine cannot overcome?

The facts prove that, in the words of the workers: "The leaders (referring to machine captains to office directors) only know how to say 'disciplinary action, send to court,' and stay at home taking care of their children, ignoring geological drilling work."

Now, Comrade Wang Picheng, the secretary of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau Party Committee, has begun to attach importance to geological drilling work and has expressed his determination to resolutely and quickly correct the phenomenon of no one being responsible for geological drilling work.

    国营峰峰煤矿地质钻探工作事故多质量坏
    国营峰峰煤矿地质钻探工作，由于存在无人负责现象，事故多的可怕，质量坏到极点。特别是一九五三年一月到三月（到二十日止以下同），一共六部钻机，共发生事故六十七次，事故耗费的时间，占总作业时间百分之七十一，因此今年第一季（到二十日止）只完成钻进计划百分之三十一点四七，平均每公尺钻进成本达三十四万一千元（去年大约六万元）。岩心采取率仅在百分之六十四点三七、煤心仅采取出百分之九（砾岩、砂岩、砂质页岩的采取率，必须在百分之七十五以上，最低不能少于百分之五十；煤心采取率应达百分之四十。两者一个达不到，钻进的孔就等于废眼）这就是说，他们虽然钻进了几百公尺，取出点岩心煤心，但还是不能根据所得的原始材料，判断地层构造，作出剖面图供给建设新矿井时作设计资料。
    这种严重情况的产生，首先是由于负责钻探工程的技术人员事先没有详细地调查地质煤田的倾斜和方位，研究旧矿井的开采情况，就盲目地设计了钻眼位置；矿务局负责钻探的局长也盲目批准，结果很多钻眼都是错误的。例如：恢复东大井时，连续把两个钻眼都打到了过去已采的老塘里了。并因老塘岩石坍落把钻管都卡在里面了，形成废眼。有些老工人说：“我们向工程技术人员和领导干部们说我们过去在这底下采过煤，建议不应在这打钻，但他们不相信，现在请他们看看吧！”
    其次就是工地无人负责。人事部门不知道钻探有多少干部和工人；工程、材料部门不知道有多少机器。许多国外定货的钢管子、套管扔在“露天仓库”里，一些钢管被作水管用了，都无人负责管理。最严重的是不久前中央拨来一部很贵重的苏联式打捞机器（处理出事故的机器），被拆卸开了，零件扔在全峰峰煤矿的各个工地上，三月十日苏联专家来峰峰煤矿时，钻探队找遍了工地也未找全打捞机。钻探队门旁放着一百九十公尺长的钢管子，上边还套着五十八公尺套管，都生了一糎多厚的锈也没人管。中央燃料工业部检查组向他们查问时，材料股说是工程股知道，工程股说材料股知道；把他们请到一起问时，他们就回答：“将来再说吧！”
    在这种情况下，事故就必然增多。有一次，二零七号钻眼的钻杆断了，管子磨管子，比磨岩石软，工人就以为遇见了煤，努力钻起来了，一直钻进了十九公尺，钻不进去了，把管子提上来一看才知道是把钢管下了十九公尺，钻眼也蹩弯了。地质钻探领导同志，在这种情况下，本应虚心学习、深入实际、依靠工人、集中群众智慧，解决关键问题，带领群众认真将国家人民交给的光荣事业作好，但他们却闹情绪，认为钻探没“前途”，或认为“我虽然没干过这玩意，我也在煤矿干好些年工作了，地质钻探有啥！”在这样错误思想支配下，当然不能兢兢业业的去干工作。有一次，报社记者请峰峰地质钻探处处长柳春耕帮助介绍一下工地情况，他信口说道：“东边有三部钻机正在钻进，咱们看看去吧！”他们到第一部钻塔前，他先使暗号——咳嗽，但工人没有理他，等他们进去看时，钻机都在“睡觉”了，水泵也“分家”了，工人向记者说：“因为缺点零件，找领导没人管就等起来了”。接着他俩就到第二部钻塔去，柳春耕没有到门边就高声谈论，以引起工人的注意，但他们进去时钻机也是在“睡觉”，这位处长气得问工人：“啥时间坏的呀！”工人们说：“坏二十多天了，管子都快提不出来了！”等到第三部钻塔时，他先领记者在外绕一圈然后进去，这时正在取岩心，他很高兴，可是上来的是空管子，记者问：“怎样取岩心呢？”大家回答说：“碰呗！”实际这位处长对工地的情况是一点也不知道。但他第二天召集全体工人大会却这样说：“不打勤、不打懒，专打不睁眼的”（意思说工人不能给撑脸）。
    在以上情况下，钻探质量愈来愈低。一月份岩心采取出百分之七十八点一七，煤心采取出百分之零点四三；等到三月份岩心采取出百分之四十，煤心则一点也没采取出来。
    其次，采取上来的岩心和煤心，要很好地按层次顺序的记录、编号，然后放到有隔板的岩心箱妥善地保管起来，以防风化和错乱，避免造成设计时的判断错误以致整个错误。但地质处把不识字或识字很少的人都派为作记录了，所以把页岩和石灰岩，都当作了燧石，累进深度与钻孔实际深度也绝大部分不一样。岩心箱没有隔板，岩心乱滚而颠倒了层序。这样就会给将来设计时造成计算错误。对于这个问题，早在二月二十六日人民日报就进行过批判，并指出改进工作的办法。但奇怪的是直到现在却没人过问这件事情。
    产生这种严重情况的原因，某些领导干部认为是“干部少、经验不足、技术低、困难多，峰峰目前没有力量来克服”，这是很不对的。因为这问题，是我们国家各个部门在目前大规模建设中共同存在的问题，不能做为峰峰矿地质钻探工作不好的借口。从事实上看，也不完全是这样。目前在钻机上已由原有六个干部增加到六十多名干部，成立了地质处、钻探工程队，以及地质钻探的党、工、团组织，比之过去，能说是干部少吗？但为什么比过去工作还坏了呢？在全国来说，峰峰矿曾经最早推广苏联“泥浆钻岩法”，创造过全国新纪录，在五零三钻眼曾采出煤心百分之六十三以上；这能说是目前峰峰煤矿不可能克服的困难吗？
    事实证明：若用工人的话说是：“领导上（指机长到处长干部）就会说‘处分、送法院’，在家抱孩子，都不管地质钻探工作了。”
    现在峰峰矿务局党委书记王丕成同志，已开始重视地质钻探工作，并表示坚决迅速纠正地质钻探工作无人负责的现象。
