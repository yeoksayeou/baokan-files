    On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
    Sun Wenxiu Improves Small Rolling Mill Roll Groove Shape
    Sun Wenxiu, a worker at the small rolling mill workshop of the First Branch of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, began studying and improving the roll groove shape of small rolling mills in 1950, and finally succeeded in the experiment on April 10th of this year. This effective improvement of the equipment played a decisive role in ensuring safe operation, as well as increasing output and quality, and reducing product costs. According to preliminary estimates, the planned profit from increased steel production alone can be increased by 3.9 billion yuan this year compared with the original plan. The success of Sun Wenxiu's equipment improvement has inspired the enthusiasm of all workers in the workshop for technical research, and more than 20 suggestions for improving equipment have been put forward in the process of ordering production plans.
    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Successfully Smelts High-Chromium Heat-Resistant Steel
    The electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant successfully smelted high-chromium heat-resistant stainless steel on March 7th. After testing, the quality of the steel fully met Soviet standards. The successful smelting of high-chromium heat-resistant stainless steel is the first time in China, and it is an important contribution to China's industrial construction.
    The electric furnace steelmaking department received the task of smelting high-chromium heat-resistant stainless steel in January of this year. The factory workers also made a lot of preparations for this, but because everyone had no experience in smelting this kind of steel, the smelting work never started.
    When the workers mourned their mentor, Comrade Stalin, with infinite grief, they recalled the past of this workshop: The electric furnace steelmaking workshop had just completed construction and put into production on April 21st last year. At that time, there were only three workers in the entire workshop with more than two years of steelmaking experience, but thanks to the kind guidance of Soviet expert Gimitov sent by Comrade Stalin, the workers learned the technology of smelting silicon steel after a few months. Thinking of this, the workers were even more convinced that as long as they earnestly learned from the Soviet Union, high-chromium heat-resistant stainless steel could be successfully smelted. They unanimously responded to Chairman Mao's call to "turn grief into strength" and "learn from the Soviet Union," and resolved to mourn the death of Comrade Stalin by smelting high-chromium heat-resistant stainless steel. Through the efforts of the workers, this kind of steel was finally successfully smelted. (Xinhua News Agency)
    East China's Steel Production Made Great Progress in April
    The production situation of state-owned and joint state-private iron and steel factories in East China in April made great progress: steel production exceeded the state plan by 1.89 percent; steel materials exceeded by 34.02 percent. The workshops of most factories have completed the quality plan.
    In the first quarter, most iron and steel factories did not earnestly mobilize workers to implement the plan and promote plan management, so the phenomenon of tightening production in the later period was very serious. In April, these factories held worker representative meetings and began to earnestly organize workers to discuss and implement the workshop operation plan for April, and mobilized them to study the key problems in production, so there was a significant change in production. For example, when the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's Third Factory rolled "light rails" in the past, the problem of red steel wrapping around the rolling mill rollers often occurred. Each time it wrapped, the workshop had to stop production for about six hours. The workers in the rolling mill workshop focused on studying this problem when discussing the implementation of the April operation plan. They earnestly learned from the experience of the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and made many improvements to the rolling mill equipment and operating procedures. This basically eliminated the problem of wrapping the rollers, and the daily output increased to more than 50 percent above the plan, and exceeded 150 percent above the plan at the highest. The Second Factory of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company was a factory with poor completion of the plan in the first quarter. The factory studied the reasons why the first quarter plan could not be completed and mobilized the workers in each workshop to implement the workshop operation plan. As a result, the April plan was completed ahead of schedule.
    The factories under the East China Steel Company will start and promote plan management in May in order to further achieve the requirements of balancedly completing the state production plan. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Groundbreaking Ceremony Held for Qinghai-Tibet Highway Construction Project
    The groundbreaking ceremony for the Qinghai-Tibet Highway construction project was held on May 1st at the Yellow River bank, which is more than 4,300 meters above sea level.
    The construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway is of great significance for changing the backward economic situation of the Tibetan people and connecting the transportation of Qinghai, Tibet, Xikang and other provinces. In 1950, after a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was ordered to repair the 504-kilometer section from Xining to the Yellow River bank, the transportation time from Xining to Yushu was shortened by half, which greatly facilitated the exchange of livestock products and industrial and agricultural products of the Tibetan people. This year, the construction project of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway is mainly the section from the Yellow River bank to Yushu. This section of the highway will span the Yellow River and the Jinsha River in the motherland, cross the Bayan Har Mountains, which are 4,800 meters above sea level, and will pass through a 12-kilometer-long desert and a 10-kilometer-long low-lying wetland. These areas have thin air and large temperature changes between day and night, making the project very difficult. In order to ensure the completion of the task, all road construction workers have written letters of determination, expressing their strong will to overcome difficulties. The Tibetan people are inspired by the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. On the day of the groundbreaking ceremony, Tibetan representative Dosro said: "Chairman Mao's brilliance has illuminated our grasslands. The construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway will make our Tibetan people feel the warmth of the national family even more. The lives of the Tibetan people will be improved more quickly. We, the Tibetan people, are determined to support the road construction work with all our strength, and will never let our employees encounter difficulties in life and work." (Xinhua News Agency)
    Many Beautiful Crops Can Grow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
    Many beautiful crops can now grow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Among these crops are plateau varieties of turnips, red-skinned radishes, white-skinned potatoes, cabbage, broad beans, oats, yellow Chinese cabbage, rapeseed, etc., and inland-produced carrots, spherical cabbage, soybeans, peas, and northern winter wheat, all of which grow very well. A single lotus cabbage can grow to more than 30 kilograms, and a lettuce or potato can also grow to more than three kilograms. The turnips planted by a certain military station weigh more than 30 kilograms each.
    The Volga winter wheat planted in Siberia, Soviet Union, was successfully trial-planted on the plateau last year. The Soviet "Xinlimei" (radish) has also been successfully trial-planted here. It contains a lot of water and can be eaten as a watermelon after it matures.
     Turning Fields That Can Only Be Planted Twice a Year Into Fields That Can Be Planted Three Times a Year
    The fourth district of Taishan County, Guangdong Province, had a bumper harvest of spring wheat this year. This place first planted wheat in the winter of 1951. However, due to the mistake of bureaucratic elements in sending late-maturing wheat seeds from other provinces, only wheat seedlings were seen but no wheat ears. Farmers could only use them to feed cattle or as fertilizer. Last autumn, the leadership conducted a review, and the county agricultural construction department and trade company purchased a large number of early-maturing wheat seeds on their behalf. As a result, the wheat had a bumper harvest. This wheat harvest has opened up a broader path for increasing production for farmers throughout the county. Fields that could only be planted twice a year can now be planted three times a year. In this district alone, at least 17,000 mu of land can be planted with wheat, and at least more than 10,000 dan of grain can be harvested next year. The farmers are very happy and have said that they will keep all the wheat harvested this time as seeds and prepare to give what they don't use to farmers in other districts as seeds.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    孙文秀改进小型轧钢机轧辊槽型
    国营天津钢厂一分厂小型轧钢车间工人孙文秀，从一九五○年开始研究改进小型轧钢机轧辊槽型，到今年四月十日最后试验成功。这一设备的有效改进，在保证安全操作方面起了决定性的作用，并提高了产量和质量，降低了产品成本。据初步估计，只增产钢材的计划利润一项，今年就可较原计划增加三十九亿元。孙文秀改进设备的成功，鼓舞了全车间工人研究技术的热情，在订生产计划过程中已提出二十多条改进设备的建议。
    太原钢铁厂冶炼高铬耐热钢成功
    太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部在三月七日冶炼高铬耐热不锈钢成功，经过化验，钢的质量完全合乎苏联标准。高铬耐热不锈钢在我国还是第一次冶炼成功，它对我国的工业建设是很重要的贡献。
    电炉炼钢部在今年一月份就接到了冲炼高铬耐热不锈钢的任务。该厂职工为此也作了很多准备工作，但因大家都没有冶炼这种钢的经验，所以冶炼工作始终没有开始。
    当工人们以无限沉痛的心情悼念自己的导师斯大林同志时，他们回忆起这个车间的过去：电炉炼钢车间在去年四月二十一日刚刚完成建设投入生产，当时全车间只有三个有二年以上炼钢经验的工人，但由于斯大林同志派来的苏联专家吉米道夫亲切的指导，工人们在几个月以后就学会了冶炼矽钢的技术。想到这些，工人们更加深信只要认真向苏联学习，高铬耐热不锈钢就能冶炼成功。他们一致响应毛主席“化悲痛为力量”、“学习苏联”的号召，决心以炼成高铬耐热不锈钢来悼念斯大林同志的逝世。经过职工的努力，这种钢终于冶炼成功。（据新华社讯）
    华东钢铁生产四月份有很大进步
    华东区国营和公私合营钢铁工厂四月份的生产情况有很大进步：钢的产量超过国家计划百分之一点八九；钢材超过百分之三十四点零二。大部分工厂的车间都完成了质量计划。
    在第一季度里，大多数钢铁工厂因为没有认真地发动职工贯彻计划和推行计划管理，所以生产中前松后紧的现象很严重。四月份，这些厂召开了职工代表会议，开始认真地组织职工讨论贯彻四月份的车间作业计划，并发动他们来研究生产中的关键问题，于是，生产上有了显著的转变。如上海钢铁公司第三厂过去轧制“轻便道轨”时，经常发生红钢缠住轧钢机辊子的毛病，每缠一次，车间就要停产六小时左右。轧钢车间的职工在讨论贯彻四月份作业计划时，就着重研究了这个问题，他们认真学习了鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂的经验，对轧钢机设备和操作程序都作了很多改进，这样就基本消灭了缠辊子的毛病，日产量提高到超过计划百分之五十，最高时超过计划百分之一百五十。上海钢铁公司第二厂是第一季度中完成计划较差的工厂，该厂研究了为什么完不成第一季度计划的原因，发动各车间职工贯彻车间作业计划，结果四月份的计划就提前完成了。
    华东钢铁公司所属各厂五月份开始并推行计划管理，以便进一步达到均衡地完成国家生产计划的要求。（新华社）
    青藏公路修建工程举行破土典礼
    青藏公路修建工程五月一日在拔海四千三百多公尺的黄河沿举行了破土典礼。
    青藏公路的修建，对于改变藏族人民落后的经济状况和沟通青海、西藏、西康等省的交通具有重大意义。在一九五○年，中国人民解放军某部奉命修好了西宁至黄河沿五百零四公里的一段后，西宁到玉树间的运输时间缩短了一半，大大便利了藏民的牧产品和工、农业产品的交流。今年，青藏公路的修建工程主要是黄河沿到玉树的一段。这段公路将横跨祖国的黄河和金沙江，翻越拔海四千八百公尺的巴颜喀拉山，并将经过十二公里长的沙漠和十公里长的低湿地带，这些地区空气稀薄，昼夜温度变化很大，工程十分艰巨。全体筑路员工为了保证任务的完成，已写了决心书，表示克服困难的坚强意志。藏族人民为青藏公路的修建所鼓舞。在举行破土典礼那天，藏族代表多斯罗说：“毛主席的光辉照亮了我们的草原，青藏公路的修筑，将使我们藏族人民更感到民族大家庭的温暖，藏族人民的生活将更快地得到提高，我们藏族人民决以全力支援修路工作，绝不使员工同志们受到生活上和工作上的困难。”（据新华社讯）
    康藏高原能生长许多美好农作物
    康藏高原上已能生长许多美好的农作物。这些农作物中，有高原品种的芜菁、红皮萝卜、白皮马铃薯、白菜、葫豆、燕麦、黄秧白、油菜籽等，有内地出产的葫萝卜、球形白菜、黄豆、豌豆和北方冬麦，这些内地农作物都生长得很好。莲花白一棵能长三十多斤重，莴笋、洋芋一个也能长三斤多重，某兵站种植的芜菁，每个重量都在三十斤以上。
    苏联西伯利亚一带种植的伏尔加冬性小麦，去年已在高原上试种成功。苏联的“心里美”（萝卜），在这里也试种成功，它含的水分极多，成熟后可以当西瓜吃。
     把一年种两季的田变得可种三季
    广东台山县第四区今年春小麦丰收。这个地方在一九五一年冬天第一次种小麦。但由于官僚主义分子错发了迟熟的外省麦种，结果只见麦苗不见麦穗，农民只能拿来喂牛，或作肥料。去年秋天，领导方面进行了检讨，同时由县农建科和贸易公司代购了大批早熟的麦种。结果，小麦丰收了。这次的小麦丰收，给全县农民开辟了更为广阔的增产的道路，原来只能种两季的田，现在可以种三季了。这样，只这一个区，至少可以有一万七千亩田种麦，明年起码可多收一万多担粮食。农民很高兴，都表示要把这次收获的麦子全部留做种籽，准备把自己用不完的给其他各区的农民作种籽用。
