    The CPC Fushong County Committee Emphasizes Theoretical Learning for Cadres
    The CPC Fushong County Committee in Liaodong Province has consistently emphasized theoretical learning for cadres. Over the past three years, it has improved the political and theoretical level of cadres and changed the face of government offices, earning praise from the Liaodong Provincial Committee.
    In early 1949, due to the needs of the revolutionary situation, the county successively transferred a large number of cadres to the interior and absorbed many new cadres. However, the new cadres had low political levels, while the original cadres were arrogant, complacent, and unwilling to work. Many cadres felt that Fushong was remote, the water and soil were unfavorable, and they were prone to local diseases, leaving them with "no future" in Fushong. In addition, old employees accounted for 80 percent of enterprise departments, and the concept of employment was very strong.
    In view of the above situation, the Fushong County Committee, according to instructions from higher authorities, decided to organize cadres to study. In August of that year, it formally established an amateur political school for government offices and organized the study of "Social Development History" first.
    In the early stages of learning, due to the leadership's lack of experience, inappropriate class assignments, unfixed teachers, and no teaching experience, students could not understand the lectures, and the learning system was extremely imperfect. As a result, students came and left as they pleased during learning, causing the learning to fall into a state of serious laxity and drift for three months.
    In order to overcome this phenomenon, the county committee held commendation and reward conferences for learning models in late 1949 and early 1950 to raise cadres' awareness of learning, and carefully studied the problems in cadre learning, and made plans to improve learning. At the same time, it stipulated that the general branches and branches of the Party organization must regularly discuss cadre learning issues and guarantee specific measures for learning. In addition, it also absorbed responsible cadres from various departments to form an administrative committee for the amateur school to strengthen specific leadership.
    This series of measures greatly helped to improve cadre learning, but for many cadres who did not pay attention to learning, it was a constraint. Some said: "Other counties don't organize cadre learning, only Fushong is 'making a fool of itself', adding 'extra burdens' to cadres in order to 'be the best'"; some said: "Theoretical learning is useless, it can't improve business or raise wages"; others resisted passively, not saying a word at discussion meetings; some departments, such as banks and tax bureaus, did not support cadre learning, thinking that it "hindered work," and even emphasized business when the branch arranged learning to show resistance.
    The county committee studied these ideological obstacles and adopted many new measures, especially emphasizing ideological leadership, and leading by example to guide cadres to correct their learning attitudes. For example, in addition to personally talking to some leading cadres who did not pay attention to learning, County Party Secretary Zhao Rixue personally convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries to criticize the erroneous view of treating guaranteeing learning as an "extra burden," and specifically assigned tasks to each branch secretary, asking them to strengthen supervision and inspection of learning, and promptly criticize erroneous ideas and strengthen ideological leadership to ensure adherence to the learning system. The county committee itself also strengthened learning, attending classes and discussions on time. County Party Secretary Zhao Rixue, even while ill, still cared about learning, making mobilization reports, organizing meetings, and studying and arranging learning, etc. The county committee's own positive and conscientious learning attitude gave the cadres a good influence. The branches of various government offices no longer shouted that learning was an "extra burden," and took seriously the task of rectifying learning. Some units that were originally relatively backward, such as the Tax Bureau, gradually became better learning units. The "evil winds and noxious influences" in learning gradually subsided. From March 1950, the foundation of cadre theoretical learning was gradually consolidated in the process of constantly overcoming difficulties.
    After the initial foundation of learning was laid, the next step was how to improve teaching quality, improve learning methods, and gradually lead learning onto the right track. To this end, in addition to paying attention to making conscientious mobilization and enlightenment reports at the beginning of each new course, the County Party Secretary and the Minister of Propaganda, many county committee members took on the role of teachers and gave lectures to the cadres. In lecturing, special attention was paid to connecting with reality, and lectures were given in light of the ideological conditions of the students and the problems existing in learning, which were well received by the students. By the winter of 1952, the Provincial Committee instructed to assign full-time teachers. The county committee carefully selected cadres and set up three teachers and one full-time cadre for the night Party school. At the beginning of this year, the number of full-time teachers was increased to five, which played a great role in the standardization of cadre learning.
    After a long period of persistence and continuous improvement, the achievements of theoretical learning are now clearly visible. The number of participants has increased from the original 200 to more than 640, accounting for more than 84 percent of the total number of government office cadres, and the enthusiasm for learning is very high. For example, in the past, everyone thought that political and theoretical learning in health and technical departments was the most difficult to organize, because many people in these departments carried the burden of "technology can travel the world"; but in Fushong County, a new situation has emerged, and the political learning of health and technical cadres has achieved remarkable results. For example, in the spring of 1950, the higher authorities assigned a group of graduates from Shenyang Medical University to Fushong to study soil and water diseases. These intellectuals, who had just graduated from university and left the big cities, came to this remote place, were not accustomed to the life, and their emotions were generally uneasy. Therefore, when treating the masses, they were irresponsible and impatient, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. Later, after the Party carried out a lot of work on them, organized political learning, especially after learning the history of the Party, the face of the hospital changed greatly. Many cadres recognized the harm of petty-bourgeois ideology to the revolution, basically overcame the fear of hardship and the purely technical viewpoint, strengthened their confidence and determination to serve the people, and improved their relations with the masses. For example, midwife Lang Jie worked in Daying Village in the county, often went deep into the masses, and explained maternal and child health knowledge to women; no matter day or night, she would go whenever she heard that a pregnant woman was about to give birth. Everyone around Daying Village knew this Lang Jie comrade who faithfully served women. When she was transferred from the village, the women were reluctant to leave her and said goodbye with tears. There are many similar examples. The phenomenon of uneasiness at work, preoccupation with personal gains and losses, and treatment has been basically overcome in many departments. For example, the current Minister of the Armed Forces Department, Bai Yushan, used to often care about treatment and was not in high spirits. After studying Comrade Gao Gang's "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?" he felt that this report was criticizing himself, and his work has undergone great changes since then. Some middle school teachers used to say: I would rather work for three hours than study for one hour; now they feel that learning is an indispensable part of life.
    A large number of cadres have been trained through learning. The county promoted 89 cadres in 1952, including 23 learning models and 59 learning activists.
    In order to promote the experience of the Fushong County Committee in leading learning, and to educate other cities and counties, the Liaodong Provincial Committee conducted a systematic understanding of the cadre learning situation in the county, and believed that Fushong was a model for organizing on-the-job cadre learning in Liaodong Province.
    Since the Central Committee issued the instruction on cadre theoretical education in 1953-1954, the Liaodong Provincial Committee has required the municipal and county party committees and the general branches of the party committees of the provincial directly affiliated organs to study the Central Committee's instructions and the People's Daily editorial "Learning the Theory and Experience of Soviet Socialist Construction is an Important Task for All Party Cadres," and must conduct an inspection of the cadre learning in their respective cities and counties based on the experience of the Fushong County Committee in leading learning, earnestly rectify it, formulate plans, and overcome the phenomenon of drifting.

### 中共抚松县委重视干部理论学习

    中共抚松县委重视干部理论学习
    中共辽东省抚松县委一贯重视干部理论学习，三年来提高了干部政治理论水平，改变了机关面貌，已受到辽东省委的表扬。
    该县在一九四九年初，由于革命形势的需要，曾先后抽调了大批干部入关，同时吸收了不少新干部。但新干部政治水平低；原有干部又骄傲自满，不安心工作；许多干部都感觉抚松偏僻，水土不好，易患地方病，留在抚松“无前途”；另外，在企业部门中旧职员占百分之八十，雇佣观点很浓厚。
    抚松县委鉴于上述情况，根据上级指示，决定组织干部学习，在当年八月就正式成立机关业余政治学校，首先组织了“社会发展史”的学习。
    学习初期由于领导缺乏经验，编班不恰当，教员不固定，且无讲授经验，学员听不懂，学习制度也极不完善；因而学习时学员愿来就来，愿走就走，使学习陷于严重松懈自流状态达三个月之久。
    为了克服这种现象，县委在一九四九年末及一九五○年初，曾先后举行学习模范的表扬奖励大会，以提高干部对学习的认识，并认真地研究了干部学习中的问题，作出了改进学习的计划。同时规定党组织的总支、支部必须定期讨论干部学习问题及保证学习的具体办法。此外，还吸收了各部门负责干部，组织机关业余学校管理委员会，以加强具体领导。
    这一系列的措施，对改进干部学习帮助很大，但对许多不重视学习的干部说来却是一个约束。他们有的说：“别的县没有组织干部学习，单是抚松‘出洋相’，为了‘抢尖’，给干部增加‘额外负担’”；有的说：“理论学习不顶事，不能提高业务，涨不了工薪”；还有消极抵抗的，在讨论会上一言不发；有些部门如银行、税局的负责同志，对干部学习也不予以支持，认为“妨碍工作”，甚至在支部布置学习时，就着重布置业务以示对抗。
    县委研究了这些思想障碍，又采取了许多新的措施，特别强调了思想领导，并以身作则，引导干部端正学习态度。如县委书记赵日学同志除了亲自找些不重视学习的领导干部进行个别谈话外，还亲自召集支部书记联席会，批判了把保证学习当成“额外负担”的错误看法，并具体向各支部书记布置任务，要他们加强对学习的监督和检查，并及时批判错误思想，加强思想领导，以保证学习制度的坚持。县委本身也加强学习，按时听课、讨论。县委书记赵日学同志虽在病中也照样关心学习，作动员报告，组织会议，研究和布置学习等。县委本身的积极认真的学习态度，给了干部们以良好的影响。各机关支部也不再喊学习是“额外负担”了，并认真负责地去整顿学习。有些原来比较落后的单位，如税务局也逐渐变成学习较好的单位了。学习中的“歪风邪气”逐渐敛迹。从一九五○年的三月份起，干部理论学习的基础，就在不断克服困难的过程中，逐渐稳固。
    在学习基础初步奠定之后，接着来的是如何提高教学质量，改进学习方法，把学习逐步引向正规的问题。为此县委书记和宣传部长除在每个新的课程开始时，注意认真作动员启发报告之外，许多县委委员都分任教员，给干部们上课。讲课中特别注意了联系实际，针对学员的思想情况和学习中存在的问题进行讲授，深受学员欢迎。到一九五二年冬，省委指示配备专职教员。县委即认真挑选了干部，设置了三名教员和一名夜党校专职干事。今年年初又把专职教员增加到五名，这对干部学习的正规化起了很大作用。
    理论学习经过长时期的坚持和不断改进，现在已可以明显地看到成绩。参加学习的人数从原有二百来人增加到六百四十余人，占机关干部总数百分之八十四以上，学习情绪很高。如过去大家认为卫生技术部门的政治理论学习最不容易组织，因为这些部门许多人都背着“技术走遍天下”的包袱；但在抚松县却已出现了新的情况，卫生技术干部的政治学习取得了显著成绩。如在一九五○年春，上级分派了一批沈阳医科大学毕业生来抚松研究水土病。这些刚出大学，刚离大城市的知识分子，来到这偏僻的地方，生活不习惯，情绪普遍不安。因此给群众治病时，不负责任，不耐心，引起群众极大不满。后来经过党对他们进行许多工作，组织政治学习，特别是学习了党的历史后，卫生院的面貌就大大改变了。许多干部认识了小资产阶级思想对革命的危害，基本上克服了怕吃苦的思想和单纯技术观点，加强了为人民服务的信心和决心，改善了对群众的关系。如助产士郎洁同志在该县大营村工作，经常深入群众，并向妇女们讲解妇婴卫生常识；孕妇临产不管白天黑夜总是听到就去。大营村周围都知道这位忠诚为妇女服务的郎洁同志。当她调离该村时，妇女们对她恋恋不舍，含泪送别。类似这样的例子很多。不安心工作，计较个人得失、待遇的现象，在许多部门中已基本上克服了。如现任武装部部长白玉山同志过去时常计较待遇，情绪不高，在学习了高岗同志的“荣誉是属于谁的？”之后，觉得这个报告正像批评自己，以后工作有了很大转变。有些中学教员过去说：宁愿做三个钟头工作也不愿学习一个钟头；现在则已感到学习是生活中不可缺少的一部分了。
    通过学习培养了大批干部。该县一九五二年提拔了八十九个干部，其中有学习模范二十三人，学习积极分子五十九人。
    为了推广抚松县委领导学习的经验，并以此教育其他的市县，辽东省委曾对该县的干部学习情况作了一次系统的了解，认为抚松是辽东省组织在职干部学习的一个范例。
    自中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示发表后，辽东省委要求各市县党委和省直属机关党委总支除研究中央指示及人民日报社论“学习苏联社会主义建设的理论和经验是全党干部的重要任务”外，必须根据抚松县委领导学习的经验，把各该市县的干部学习作一次检查，切实加以整顿，订出计划，克服自流现象。
