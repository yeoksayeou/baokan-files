    U.S. Domestic Warmongers
    Clamor for Expanding the War of Aggression Against Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch from New York] As the U.S. negotiating representative Harrison made the request to adjourn the meeting in Panmunjom, extreme forces within the United States were again clamoring to intensify and expand the Korean War.
    According to International News Service, leading figures of the U.S. Republican Party, Senate leader Taft and Speaker of the House Martin, declared on the 16th that if the negotiations broke down, the United States would wage a "total war" against China in Korea. Taft said: "We are not yet able to launch a new offensive campaign... I doubt whether we have enough strength there now, so we must maintain a stalemate war until we are ready to attack." When discussing the same issue, Martin said: "The United States should step up the fighting, and we must use every means to achieve victory as soon as possible."
    U.S. warmongering military man, former Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet, who directly commanded the war of aggression against Korea, opposed continuing negotiations in an article published in the recent issue of the American magazine "Life". He said that negotiating a solution to the Far East issue "has no possible basis," and the only way is to "achieve military victory."

    美国国内的好战分子
    叫嚷扩大侵朝战争
    【新华社十九日讯】纽约消息：当美方谈判代表哈利逊在板门店提出休会的要求时，美国国内的极端势力又在叫嚷要加紧和扩大朝鲜战争。
    据国际新闻社消息，美国共和党首脑人物、参议院领袖塔夫脱和众议院议长马丁十六日扬言，如果谈判破裂，美国就要在朝鲜与中国进行“全面战争”。塔夫脱说：“现在我们还不能够发动一个新的进攻战役……我怀疑我们现在在那里是否有足够的力量，所以我们要保持僵持的战争，直到我们准备好进攻。”马丁在谈论同一问题时说：“美国应该加强战斗，我们必须用一切办法来尽早取得胜利。”
    美国好战军人、直接指挥过侵朝战争的前第八军军长范佛里特在最近一期的美国“生活”杂志上发表的文章里反对继续谈判。他说，谈判解决远东问题“没有可能的基础”，唯一办法是“取得军事胜利”。
