    Experience in Organizing Balanced Production in Single-Piece and Small-Batch Production
    Zhao Dongwan, Director of Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant
    Single-piece and small-batch production can be organized into
    relative rhythmic production
    The product range of our factory is extremely complex. In the manufacturing of motors, we have products ranging from small half-horsepower motors to large one-hundred-horsepower motors, from DC motors to AC motors, from electric motors to transformers. In mechanical manufacturing: winches range from thirty horsepower to three hundred horsepower; reducers range from one hundred horsepower to five hundred horsepower; water pumps range from one hundred horsepower to over one thousand three hundred and twenty-five horsepower; drilling machines range from five hundred meters to one thousand meters. In vehicle manufacturing: from rolling stock to locomotive overhaul, from parts to manufacturing. In addition, we also process parts for other factories and mines. Therefore, a Soviet expert once commented on the complexity of our factory's products, saying: "Only farming is missing."
    The complexity of the products has created several characteristics in our factory's production, namely: complex products, but not many manufactured; frequent changes in variety, extremely diverse specifications; frequent imbalances in equipment; complex material supply, from motor materials to vehicle materials; high technical requirements for workers, because the factory has to make not only winches, but also machine tools, large and small, precise and crude, requiring workers with high technical levels to undertake these tasks; and the method of putting into production is staggered.
    These characteristics have caused confusion and volatility in our factory's production management, diverting the energy of leading cadres. Some processes and sections have high efficiency, but the factory's production tasks cannot be completed. Many semi-finished products and parts are piled up in the workshops. The factory's monthly income is sometimes only enough to pay wages, and sometimes it has to rely on credit to survive.
    In August 1952, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed us to organize relative rhythmic production to reverse this chaotic situation. However, in the case of complex products, single-piece and small-batch production, can relative rhythmic production be organized? At that time, there were two views in our factory. Some people were waiting for specialized production, believing that relative rhythmic production could not be implemented until diversified production was changed to single-type production. Others believed that in factories with multiple products, rhythmic production could be organized immediately according to the instruction charts.
    We believe that the first view is incorrect. Because they believe that we are powerless in the case of "odd jobs," this is actually a passive idea of waiting for specialized production. We criticized this idea. The second view, based on our factory's situation, is correct as a direction of effort, but immediate chart management is also divorced from reality. Because our factory's products are not fixed, and the minimum condition for implementing chart management is to have a basic product. Each workshop in our factory has as many as ten or more types of products, therefore, there must be a process for implementing chart management. After research, our factory believes that the way to reverse the chaotic situation is to fundamentally organize production, that is, to organize complex production, and then organize relative rhythmic production.
    Strengthen leadership and carry out organizational work
    How to organize relative rhythmic production? We first strengthened the leadership of workshops and sections. In key workshops, we assigned capable cadres as workshop directors and appropriately adjusted section chiefs. Because in the case of non-single production, many specific problems need to be resolved by grassroots cadres, otherwise, production will be affected. In sections, we first strengthened functional sections such as design, planning, supply, and inspection, requiring them to actively cooperate with the workshops, and from design to planning to material supply, they must unconditionally face the workshops.
    While strengthening the leadership of workshops and sections, we implemented a product responsibility system. Due to the excessive number of product types, it is impossible for leading cadres to keep a close eye on each product at all times. Therefore, it was decided that for each product, a dedicated person from the leadership would be assigned to be responsible for it to the end.
    Prepare workshop and section operation plans
    Maintain the balance of production and equipment
    Strengthening the leadership of workshops and sections and implementing a product responsibility system are only organizational preparations for organizing relative rhythmic production. Workshop and section plans must also be prepared, and production must be controlled through plans. Although our operation plan is still rough compared to other advanced factories, it is very necessary. Preparing an operation plan can make the national plan specific to the actual work of each section; production can be controlled according to the plan, so as to relatively achieve rhythm; the balance between workshops and processes can be considered according to the plan, such as whether the equipment is balanced, whether there is too much or too little, whether the labor force allocation is balanced, so as to adjust and make production connected and balanced.
    The main contents of the operation plan: (1) Variety: Since our products and accessories are complex, we must first clarify how many varieties there are, and what those varieties are. (2) Quantity: Clarify how many products there are.
    (3) Stipulate the coordination of raw material supply and processing, and processing and assembly, and appropriately stipulate production preparation time according to specific circumstances to avoid affecting the entire factory's production due to the imbalance of individual sections. (4) Technical requirements: such as dimensions, specifications, etc., formulated according to the requirements on the drawings, and the tool problem must be fully considered at the same time. (5) Progress: Arrange parts according to working hours, and clarify when to put into production and when to complete (but consider inspection and handling time).
    Our factory had equipment first and then production objects, so equipment imbalance often occurs. The first problem we encountered when preparing the operation plan was the imbalance of equipment. To solve this problem, we took two measures: The first measure was to appropriately adjust the use of equipment. For example, when producing a five-hundred-meter drilling machine, we lacked six boring machines and five milling machines, so we tried to use substitute machines as much as possible to reduce the phenomenon of insufficient equipment. The second measure was to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and leading cadres investigated which places were weak links, that is, to promote certain advanced experiences. For example, when producing drilling machines, we found that there were not enough gear washing machines, so we learned and promoted the Soviet Union's reverse milling method, and as a result, the efficiency increased by eighteen times, making both workers and equipment rich.
    The second problem we encountered when preparing the operation plan was the quality problem. Because our factory is single-piece production and small-batch production, workshops and sections will not have the turnover and reserves of mass production. If there is a quality problem, the entire operation plan will be disrupted. Therefore, the main problem for factories with small-batch production and single-piece production is to ensure quality, otherwise it is impossible to achieve relative balanced production. We have three measures to solve the quality problem: First, determine a foreman in the section to be specifically responsible for quality, and conduct inspection work from drawing review to internal section inspection; second, the supply section must control the quality of materials and inspect raw materials; third, mobilize the masses to control quality.
    Mobilize the masses to discuss the operation plan and
    Check the plan
    Our factory's production objects change frequently. Every time the product is changed, the masses must be mobilized to discuss and formulate an operation plan, so that workers can clarify the production objects and their technical requirements, so that workers can master the progress of various products; understand where the weak links are and how to overcome them; understand the coordination relationship between sections and processes to ensure relative rhythmic production.
    After discussing and formulating the plan, the most important issue is to check the implementation of the plan. Our methods are three: (1) Workers conduct self-inspection: twice a week, once focusing on technical requirements (quality), and once focusing on quantity and progress; (2) Workshop inspection: every day the foreman reports his progress and quality; (3) Factory-wide inspection: also divided into two times, one is reported by the directors of each workshop, and the other is attended by the directors of the workshop and invited production, technology, supply, inspection and other departments to raise questions and solve problems.
    In short, single production and small-batch production especially need to be well organized. From the formulation of the plan to the realization of the plan, we must rely on all employees to undertake complex work in order to complete the task.
    Results of organizing relative rhythmic production
    As a result of doing this in our factory, the equilibrium rate of production in September of last year increased by 107.1% compared to August, and in October it increased by 114.6% compared to August. However, even if we have found some laws of balanced production in organizing single production and small-batch production, it is still very far from truly rhythmic production. We believe that under the leadership of the higher leading organs and the Municipal Party Committee, we will continue to work hard in this direction to improve, and finally we will achieve rhythmic production organized according to the instruction charts.

    在单个的和小批的生产中组织均衡生产的经验
    抚顺机电厂厂长  赵东宛
    单个的和小批的生产能组织
    相对的节奏生产
    我厂产品品种十分复杂。在电机制造方面，有小到半马力和大到一百马力的产品，从直流电机到交流电机，从电动机到变压器。在机械制造方面：卷扬机从三十马力到三百马力；减速机从一百马力到五百马力；水泵从一百马力到一千三百二十五马力以上；钻探机从五百公尺到一千公尺。在车辆制造方面：从车皮到车头检修，从配件到制造。此外，还要为别的厂矿加工配件。因此，曾有一位苏联专家谈到我厂产品的复杂情况时说：只缺少种地。
    产品的复杂，造成我厂在生产上的几个特点，即：产品复杂，但制造的数量却不多；品种经常变动，规格极为繁多；设备经常不平衡；材料供应复杂，从电机材料直到车辆材料都要供应；对工人的技术要求较高，因为工厂不但要作卷扬机，也要作工作母机，大小精粗不一，需要有较高的技术水平的工人担负这些工作；投入生产的方式是交错进行的。
    以上这些特点，造成我厂生产管理上混乱多变，使领导干部精力分散。某些工序、工段效率很高，而全厂生产任务却不能完成。很多半成品和部件摆在车间里积压起来。工厂每月收入有时只够发工资，有时还要靠信贷过活。
    一九五二年八月，中共抚顺市委指示我们组织相对的节奏生产以扭转这种混乱局面。但是在产品复杂，单个的和小批的生产的情况下能不能组织相对的节奏生产呢？当时，在我们厂里有两种看法。有些人等待专业化生产，认为在把多样生产改变为单种生产之前，是不能实行相对的有节奏生产的。有些人则认为在多种产品的工厂中也可以马上按指示图表组织有节奏的生产。
    我们认为第一种看法是不对的。因为他们认为我们在“打杂”的情况下是无能为力的，实际上这是一种消极等待专业化生产的思想。我们批判了这种思想。第二种看法，根据我厂情况来看，当作努力方向是对的，但立即进行图表管理，也是脱离现实的。因为我厂产品不固定，而实行图表管理的起码条件要有一种基本产品。我厂各车间的产品，有多至十种以上的，因此，实行图表管理要有一个过程。我厂根据以上所说的特点，经过研究后认为扭转混乱局面的办法，根本工作是生产的组织工作，即将复杂的生产组织起来，然后组织相对的节奏生产。
    加强领导，进行组织工作
    如何组织相对的节奏生产呢？我们首先加强车间和科股的领导。在关键性的车间，我们配以能力强的干部作车间主任，并适当地调整工段长。因为在非单一生产的情况下，很多具体问题需要基层干部负责解决，不然，生产便受到影响。在科股，首先加强设计、计划、供应、检查等职能科，要求他们主动地与车间配合，从图纸设计到计划到材料供应，必须无条件地面向车间。
    在加强车间、科股的领导的同时，我们实行产品的专责制度。由于产品种类过多，领导干部不可能在每一个时候把每种产品都抓得很紧。因此决定每种产品，都由领导方面指定专人负责到底。
    编制车间工段的作业计划
    保持生产和设备的平衡
    加强车间科股领导，实行产品的专责制度，只是给组织相对的节奏生产在组织上准备条件，还要做好车间工段计划，通过计划来控制生产。虽然我们的作业计划比起其它先进厂来还是粗糙的，但却是十分需要的。编制作业计划，可以使国家计划具体化到每一个工段的实际工作中去；可以根据计划来控制生产，以便相对地达到节奏性；可以根据计划来考虑车间与工序的均衡，如设备是否均衡，有无过多过少，劳动力配备是否均衡，以便调整，使生产达到衔接与平衡。
    作业计划的主要内容：（一）品种：由于我们产品与配件复杂，所以首先必须明确品种是多少，是那些品种。（二）数量：明确产品的数量有多少。
    （三）规定原料供应与加工、加工与装配的配合，根据具体情况适当规定生产准备时间，以避免因个别工段的不平衡而影响全厂生产。（四）技术要求：如尺寸、规格等，按图纸上的要求制定，同时要充分考虑工具问题。（五）进度：按工时排列部件，并明确何时投入生产与何时完成（但要考虑检验与搬运时间）。
    我厂是先有设备而后才有生产对象的，因此，经常发生设备不均衡现象。在编制作业计划时，我们碰到的第一个问题，便是设备的不均衡性。为了解决这一问题，我们采取了两种措施：第一种措施，是适当地调整设备的运用，如生产五百公尺钻探机时，差六部搪床，差五部铣床，我们便尽量使用代用机器，以减少设备不足的现象。第二种措施，便是学习苏联先进经验，领导干部考察那些地方是薄弱环节，即推广某些先进经验。如生产钻机时，发现洗齿机床不够，便学习并推广苏联的反铣法，结果效率提高了十八倍，使工人和设备都富裕出来了。
    在编制作业计划时，我们碰到的第二个问题，便是质量问题。因为我厂是单个生产和小批生产，所以车间、工段就不会有大批生产那样的周转量和储备量，假如一碰到质量有问题，便整个打乱了作业计划。所以小批生产和单个生产的工厂，主要的问题是保证质量，否则无法达到相对的均衡生产。我们解决质量问题的措施有三：第一，在工段中确定一个工长专门负责质量，进行从图纸审核到工段内部的检查工作；第二，供应科要控制材料质量，检验原材料；第三，发动群众来控制质量。
    发动群众讨论作业计划和
    检查计划
    我厂生产对象经常变动，每变更一次产品，就要发动群众讨论和制定一次作业计划，才能使工人明确生产对象及其技术要求，使工人掌握各种产品的进度；了解薄弱环节所在及克服的办法；了解各工段工序之间的配合关系，保证相对的节奏生产。
    讨论和制定计划之后，最重要的问题是检查计划的执行。我们的方法有三：（一）工人自行检查：每周进行两次，一次着重在技术要求上（质量），一次着重在数量与进度上；（二）车间检查：每天由工长汇报自己的进度与质量；（三）全厂检查：也分两次，一次是由各车间主任汇报，一次是由车间主任，并邀请生产、技术、供应、检查等科参加，提出问题，解决问题。
    总之，单个生产与小批生产特别需要组织得好，从订计划到实现计划，都必须依靠全体职工将复杂的工作担当起来，才能完成任务。
    组织相对的节奏生产的成果
    我们厂这样做的结果，去年九月份生产的均衡率比八月份提高了百分之一○七·一，十月份比八月份提高了百分之一一四·六。但是，即使我们在组织单个生产和小批生产中摸到了一些均衡生产的规律，但距离真正的有节奏的生产还是很远的。我们相信在上级领导机关和市委的领导下，继续朝这个方向努力改进，最后将会达到按指示图表组织有节奏的生产的。
