    All-China Federation of Educational Workers' Unions Holds Symposium, Inviting Chinese and Soviet Representatives Attending the Chinese Trade Union Congress to Participate

    The All-China Federation of Educational Workers' Unions convened a symposium on the 8th. Attendees included Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Educational Workers' Unions; Vice Chairmen Liu Zijiu, Qian Duansheng, and Lang Jiehua; Standing Committee member Che Xiangchen, and other representatives of educational workers who came to Beijing to attend the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. Also present was D.M. Orudzheva, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic Middle and Primary School Trade Union, a member of the Soviet Trade Union delegation invited to our country to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

    At the meeting, D.M. Orudzheva introduced the work of the Azerbaijan Republic Middle and Primary School Trade Union. She pointed out: The Party, the administration, and the trade union must cooperate closely in their work, and the trade union must be the promoter of the Party and government policies. The trade union's responsibility is to inspect and supervise work and to find ways to improve the shortcomings that exist in the work. The Azerbaijan Republic Middle and Primary School Trade Union regularly discusses issues related to school life, how to improve the ideological level of teachers, teachers' labor protection, social insurance, how to reduce the incidence of illness among teachers, and other problems discovered in practical work. If shortcomings are discovered during inspections, the central committee of the trade union will convene a plenary meeting for discussion, make resolutions at the meeting, formulate improvement measures, and submit them to the relevant units for resolution. She also explained that the work of the Soviet trade union from the grassroots to the central level is carried out step by step and according to plan.

    Liu Zijiu also briefly described the organizational system of the Chinese Education Union at the meeting.
