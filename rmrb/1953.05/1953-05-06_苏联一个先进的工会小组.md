    An Advanced Trade Union Group in the Soviet Union
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
    Recently, I read in "Labor News" Damara Gimoshna's account of the work of her trade union group. The ordinary and true things described by this young female worker deeply moved me. In this true story, I saw the concrete experience of Soviet trade union groups, which in all aspects demonstrated the great Lenin and Stalin's instruction that trade unions are schools of communism; aren't these experiences precisely the references needed for our grassroots trade union work? In this true story, I also saw the communist moral character of Soviet workers; that spirit of comradely mutual assistance, cooperation, and friendship, that spirit of always thinking of the interests of the motherland and working together towards the goal of communism, isn't it precisely a model worthy of our workers to learn from in the motherland's large-scale construction? Therefore, I spare no effort to introduce Comrade Gimoshna's account in detail.
    Lathe operator Damara Gimoshna is the head of the trade union group in the eighth section of the fourth mechanical assembly workshop of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory. The trade union group she leads has more than twenty people. Their ages, skills, and personalities are different; but thanks to communist education, they all love their work and care about the development of production. Therefore, the section where the Gimoshna trade union group is located has won the workshop's mobile red banner three times in 1952, and overfulfilled the 1952 plan, and work has been progressing more rhythmically since the New Year.
    The following is Comrade Gimoshna's account.
    Our production team is a youth team. There are twenty-one people in the team. Many are female members of the Communist Youth League. They are striving, enthusiastic, and united people. With such people, mountains can be moved. However, when these female lathe operators elected me as the head of the trade union group, I was initially anxious: "Can I handle it? I have to be responsible for everyone..."
    The Party group leader, Ivan Ivanovich Rybkin, said to me: "You can handle it! The main thing is to strive to unite the collective. Your strength lies in the activists in the group."
    The workshop trade union committee has been helping our trade union group leaders from the beginning. The chairman of the workshop trade union committee, V.I. Hotetovsky, explained our responsibilities in detail at the guiding meeting, emphasizing that the most important task is to strive to develop socialist competition. Comrade Stalin taught us that the principle of competition is to help the backward catch up with the advanced, and to achieve universal improvement on this basis.
    The Growth of an Excellent Female Worker
    About a year ago, Nina Artyomova joined our team. She came straight from school after finishing seventh grade. She had only seen such complex technology as we have here in movies before. At first, she was assigned to experienced lathe operator Nina Minakova. Artyomova proved to be a capable apprentice. After a few days, she was already making parts herself. After observing her, foreman A.F. Olenyev said: "You are a confident person who can estimate by sight. You have a bright future." Artyomova still needed to learn. But an urgent order came, and Minakova was transferred to another section. Artyomova began to work independently.
    Week after week passed. The foreman forgot about the new female lathe operator. I noticed that things were not going well with Artyomova. But she kept silent. I thought, maybe she has occasional difficulties? I also kept silent, pretending I didn't see anything: Why bother her for no reason! Once, just after returning from lunch, I saw Nina standing next to her lathe, her face flushed, her eyes tearful. There were some new parts in the box. I guessed that she hadn't gone to lunch; she was working. I approached her and asked: What's wrong?
    She replied: "I'm not doing well. According to the quota, I have to make 920 nuts per shift, but I can't make more than 700. Sometimes the cutting tool breaks, sometimes the parts fly away... It seems I can't become a lathe operator."
    I said: "Don't rush to conclusions. Tell me: Why didn't you ask for help in time? Did the foreman refuse? And we, the female lathe operators, won't let you go without help."
    "I didn't want to bother you with such a request. You know, the foreman praised me, and I..." She said this and burst into tears. I felt sorry for her, but I didn't show it. I blamed her for not asking for advice, and then asked: "Show me how you install the parts."
    I watched and saw that the parts were not pressed correctly, the frame was pushed too hard, and the cutting tool almost broke. I tried my best to explain her mistakes. Later, I found time to go to her lathe and show her how to press the parts. I talked to her several times. She was relieved, and things improved slightly. However, I saw that it was far from perfect. What was needed immediately was not occasional consultation, but regular learning. I exchanged opinions with the foreman and said to the female Stakhanovites: "Girls, Nina Artyomova needs help. Who is responsible?"
    We have such a rule: backbone female workers voluntarily provide personal assistance to newcomers. There are always volunteers. This time was no exception.
    Lathe operator Polina Konyukhova said: "Please entrust me. I'm close to Nina, and I can help her better than others..."
    No one objected. Konyukhova began to regularly stay with Artyomova after work. She carefully explained how to sharpen cutting tools, introduced the new methods she used, and showed her how to operate the lathe. This learning continued for ten and a half days. The results were very good: Nina began to fulfill the quota. Later, the day came when she made 970 nuts in one shift—50 more than the quota. After work, the activists stayed in the workshop to prepare and put up a slogan: "Congratulations to Nina Artyomova, she has fulfilled 105 percent of the quota."
    The next morning when I came, Nina immediately came to me. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes anxious. She said: "How can this be? I haven't done anything. And Ugarova and Kuchunzova fulfilled 180 percent of the quota, and I..."
    I said: "Ugarova and Kuchunzova have been on the workshop's honor roll, and your first achievement was not easy for you to obtain..."
    After that, Artyomova worked even harder. We made sure she didn't stop learning. After work, she still stayed with Konyukhova to learn from her experience. Once, Nina Ugarova, the social inspector in charge of labor protection, noticed that Artyomova's lathe was not tidy. At our request, the foreman specifically talked to her about how to organize her workplace. Nina gradually, bit by bit, gained production skills and experience.
    Several months have passed since then. Not long ago, Nina came to me and said: "Damara, I want to join the Communist Youth League. What do you think—will they accept me?"
    I replied: "Yes, the right decision. You are now a female Stakhanovite, you are fulfilling 150 percent of the quota, you care about social work... I can introduce you."
    At the meeting to discuss Nina's application, there were many members of our production team. We recalled how things didn't go well for her at first, how she didn't believe that she could become a skilled lathe operator at some point. Remembering all this, we were happy for her achievements together. You know, this is to cultivate outstanding female producers and experts in their own careers through common efforts!
    Kopeks and Seconds
    We have an adjuster in our section, Klavdia Alekseyevna Insakova. She has been involved in production for more than a year, and is familiar with the work. She works and works, imparting her experience to young people, teaching skills to people. But either Insakova's temperament is special, or she is lazy: she moves so slowly and unhurriedly, as if she is not standing next to the lathe, but drinking tea at home.
    The girls sometimes shout: "Klavdia, hurry up! My lathe is broken, I'm stopped."
    She replies: "Look, how clever. You stop for a while, it doesn't matter. Stopping for ten minutes won't cause a catastrophe..."
    We, the activists, have talked to Insakova more than once, but all in vain. You talk to her, you mention the phenomenon of stoppage, but she replies: "How can you instruct me. You've been involved in production for less than a year, and you've become a female teacher. I know what I'm doing."
    Seeing that any talk could not get through to Insakova, I went to consult with the foreman. He said: "I've also noticed for a long time that Insakova is not very hardworking, and criticizing her doesn't help. I have to give a warning..."
    I didn't like this idea. Giving a warning is not difficult. But can we help in some other way? We remembered that we would have a production meeting in a few days. We should talk about the lazy adjuster at that meeting. I discussed it with the activists, and they agreed. We prepared solemnly before the meeting—selected materials, considered the operating methods of several female lathe operators, made the necessary calculations, and when the foreman asked me to speak, I began to speak in an orderly manner:
      "Not long ago, we summarized the socialist competition and understood that our quotas were all overfulfilled ahead of schedule. Everyone is happy: what a good section! It seems that all potential forces have been utilized, and there is nothing more to strive for. But is this actually the case? The 19th Party Congress decided to reduce the cost of industrial products by about 25 percent in five years. This means that all of us must carry out the strictest economy in production. And how do we save? For example, this is drilling machine worker Zubareva. She carelessly broke three drills in one week. You know, each one is worth three rubles."
    I saw that the girls were listening attentively, I looked at the paper and continued: "Also, sometimes we consume more metal than we should, valuable tools are broken due to lack of experience or carelessness, but the biggest loss is the loss of time. These losses often occur with Insakova. For example, not long ago she spent an hour and a half to adjust the lathe of gear scraper worker Vizovkina, which could have been done in twenty minutes. This means that more than an hour was wasted. Insakova thinks this is a trivial matter. But you know that Vizovkina can make twenty rings in an hour. How many times has Insakova had such trivial matters?..."
    As soon as I finished reporting, lathe operator Alexandra Belokurova asked to speak. She is the kind of person who always speaks first, and always speaks logically. She said: "We all said that we would complete the five-year task ahead of schedule. That's why we are calculating seconds and caring about kopeks. We know that hours accumulate from seconds, and rubles accumulate from kopeks. But it seems that Insakova doesn't care about this. She is a generous woman: losing an hour is a trivial matter, reducing the completion of the quota by 10 percent is a detail. Isn't it clear how harmful this is to production? Today we record this: Insakova doesn't care about production and drags the production team backward..."
    Other female lathe operators—Nina Yermishova, Volya Pakhomova, Maria Kuchunzova—all spoke. The foreman also blamed Insakova. Our Insakova blushed and sat in the corner without saying a word. When the meeting was about to end, she asked to speak: "Comrades, this conversation has not been in vain for me. I promise: I will not repeat my mistakes!"
    The meeting went well. We talked heart-to-heart about what should be talked about. We analyzed from the perspective of the masters what potential forces we have to complete the five-year task ahead of schedule, and where we can save in production. It was decided to reduce the consumption of electricity and tools and completely eliminate the loss of time. Female Stakhanovites Bakshina, Kuchunzova, and Ugarova came up with good ideas. They proposed the establishment of a joint production team to save metal. In a short period of time, the production team put forward five rationalization proposals. This saved us 100 tons of metal a year. In February and March, it has already saved the state a large sum of money. Our adjuster Insakova also helped to achieve this achievement.
    The Spirit of Perseverance
    Not long ago, our production team was entrusted with manufacturing a large number of brackets. But for some reason, the packaging for the brackets was not given. The female lathe operators completed the work and put the parts next to the lathe. In a short period of time, all the aisles were filled with brackets. We suddenly became crowded and uncomfortable. Of course, comfort is not the main thing. The girls sometimes have to spend a minute leaving the lathe during shift changes and going to the warehouse or the foreman. If you walk fast, you almost kick your feet. Seeing this, lathe operator Nina Ugarova said angrily: "It's not right! I demand that order be restored immediately."
    She was elected here as the social inspector responsible for labor protection. It should be said that she does this enthusiastically and sincerely. She doesn't let go of any small things. From morning to night, her loud voice can be heard in the section: "Yermishova, why aren't you wearing protective glasses? You know, shavings can hurt your eyes..." During the day, just as the lunch break began, she went to the workshop trade union committee and said: "When will the workshop door be repaired? There is a draft there, and people will catch a cold." In the afternoon, after work, she rushed to the factory hospital and said: "I request that a lecture on preventing influenza be organized in our section..." In a word, Nina is a striving and resolute girl. She always does everything enthusiastically.
    But this time the scythe hit the stone. The foreman listened hastily to the words about having to move the brackets from the aisle, waved his hand and said: "It's nothing, just leave them there! Let the female lathe operators walk carefully and watch their feet..." Ugarova ran to Comrade Kursky, the technician. He also didn't listen clearly to the words of this activist and said: "Brackets? You take care of these small things, leave them for a week or two, and then we'll move them..."
    Ugarova came to consult with me. We considered and decided to find Comrade Borovkov, the section chief, together. We talked to him and explained our request. Comrade Borovkov replied: "The technician is right: there are more important things now. We guarantee to give you the packaging in two or three days..." We waited. The deadline passed, and nothing changed. We complained to the workshop trade union committee. But Comrade Hotetovsky, the chairman of the workshop trade union committee, said: "I can't help now, please wait."
    To tell the truth, I relaxed at the time. I thought, it seems that it is simply impossible to move the brackets now. Is it worth bothering with this issue for so long, interrupting people's work, and troubling the workshop trade union committee? After all, it's not that important... I talked to Ugarova about this, but she replied to me: "Why isn't it worth bothering with? You know, when the brackets are left in the aisle, it looks like someone among us will be injured. Can we leave it like this! I'm going to the workshop director!"
    I tried to persuade Ugarova. I persuaded her that Comrade Stolyarov, the workshop director, must already know our request, and he would have given me the packaging sooner if he could. What's the point of going there. We almost argued, but she still insisted on her own opinion. As soon as work started, she ran to Stolyarov alone. At that time, I was busy with other things.
    The next morning I came to the workshop and saw the workers moving the brackets. I said to Nina: "Did you win?" She replied:
    "Didn't you see. And they gave us the packaging today. You said: I went for nothing... Can you treat people's health like that? Alas, you liberal!"
    I felt wronged. But I kept silent. Really, what could I answer? In fact, Nina was right. From then on, I really understood: without a true spirit of perseverance, success cannot be achieved.
                      (To be continued)

    苏联一个先进的工会小组
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    最近，我在“劳动报”读到了达玛拉·吉莫施娜关于她那工会小组的工作的叙述。这个年青女工所叙述的平凡的真事，深深地感动了我。在这个真事里，我看到了苏联工会小组的具体经验，这些经验从各方面表现了工会就是共产主义学校这个伟大的列宁和斯大林的指示；这些经验不正是我们工会基层工作所需要的参考吗？在这个真事里，我也看到了苏联工人的共产主义道德面貌；那种同志的互助、合作、友爱的精神，那种经常为祖国利益着想并且齐心协力地朝着共产主义目标前进的精神，不正是值得我们工人在祖国大规模建设中学习的榜样吗？所以我不厌求详地把吉莫施娜同志的叙述介绍过来。
    镟工达玛拉·吉莫施娜是莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂第四机械装配间第八工段的工会小组长。她领导的工会小组有二十多人。他们的年龄、技艺、性格各不相同；但由于共产主义教育，他们都爱自己的工作，都关心发展生产。所以，吉莫施娜工会小组所在的工段，在一九五二年三次得到了车间的流动优胜红旗，全体超额地完成了一九五二年计划，新年以来工作进行得更有节奏。
    以下是吉莫施娜同志的叙述。
    我们的生产组是青年组。组里有二十一个人。有不少女共产主义青年团员。是奋发、热情、齐心的人们。同这样的人们一起，山都可以移掉。可是，当这些车床女工选我当工会小组长时候，我起初焦虑着：“担负得起吗？要对全体负责哩……”
    党小组长伊凡·伊凡诺维奇·雷布金对我说：“你担负得起！主要的，你努力团结集体。你的力量就在组里积极分子身上。”
    车间工会委员会从开始就帮助我们工会小组长们。车间工会委员会主席维·伊·何捷托夫斯基在指导性会议上详细地讲解了我们的责任，着重指出了最重要的任务在于尽力发展社会主义竞赛。斯大林同志教导我们，竞赛的原则是：帮助落后的赶上先进的，并且在这个基础上取得普遍的提高。
    一位优秀女工的成长
    约莫一年以前，妮娜·阿尔捷莫娃加入了我们组。她是读完七年级刚出校门就来的。像我们这里这样复杂技术，她以前只在电影中见过。起初把她编到有经验的镟工妮娜·明纳科娃那里。阿尔捷莫娃显得是能干的女学徒。过了几天，她已经自己在制造零件了。领班阿·费·奥列涅夫观察她以后说：“你是有信心、能目测的人。你的前途远大。”阿尔捷莫娃还需要学习。可是来了紧急定货，明纳科娃调到别的工段去了。阿尔捷莫娃开始独立地工作。
    过一个星期又一个星期。领工把新来的车床女工忘记了。我注意到，阿尔捷莫娃那里事情没有妥贴。可是她不做声。我想，可能她有偶尔的困难？我也不做声，装作什么也没有看见的样子：何必凭空惊扰人家！有一次刚从午饭回来，看见妮娜站在自己的车床旁边，脸孔发红，眼睛含泪。匣子里搁着一些新的零件。我猜到，她没有去吃午饭，她工作着。我走近她，问道：怎么一回事？
    她回答：“我的事情没有弄好。按照定额每班要做九百二十个螺丝帽，而我做不到七百个以上。一会儿削截刀折坏了，一会儿零件飞走了……看来，我成不了镟工。”
    我说：“你不要急着做结论。你对我说吧：为什么不及时要求帮助？难道领班拒绝了吗？而且我们，车床女工们，不会让你没有帮助的。”
     “我不便把这样的请求去打搅。要知道领班夸奖过我，而我……”她说了这些便哭开了。我怜惜她，可是不露样子。我责备她不来问意见，然后要求：“给我看你怎样装零件。”
    我瞧着，看到零件压得不对，架子推得太猛，削截刀差点折坏。我尽量对她解释了错的地方。后来，再找出空隙，到她的车床去，指点她怎样压零件。我又同她谈了几次。她放了心，事情稍有改进。然而我看到，离完善还远。立刻需要的不是不时的请教，而是经常的学习。我同领班交换了意见，向女斯大哈诺夫工作者们说：“姑娘们，妮娜·阿尔捷莫娃需要帮助。谁负责？”
    我们有这样的规矩：骨干女工按照自愿来进行对新手的个人帮助。志愿军总是有的。这次也是这样。
    镟工波里娜·科纽何娃说：“请委托我。我同妮娜要好，我比别人更好帮助她……”
    谁也没有反对。科纽何娃开始有规则地在下班后同阿尔捷莫娃留下来。她仔细地讲解了怎样磨削截刀，介绍了所采用的新方法，指点了怎样操纵车床。这个学习继续了十天半个月。成绩很好：妮娜开始完成定额。后来这样的日子来到了，她一班内制造了九百七十个螺丝帽—比定额多出五十个。下班后，积极分子们留在车间，筹备和挂出了标语：“祝贺妮娜·阿尔捷莫娃，她完成了定额百分之一○五。”
    第二天早上我来的时候，妮娜立刻到我这里。脸颊绯红，眼睛焦灼。她说：“这怎么行？要知道我没有做什么。而乌加罗娃、库琼佐娃完成了定额的百分之一八○，而我……”
    我说：“乌加罗娃、库琼佐娃上过车间的光荣榜，而你的初次成就对你也不是容易得到的……”
    此后阿尔捷莫娃更加努力。我们注意使她不停止学习。下班后她照旧同科纽何娃留下来，学取她的经验。有一次管劳动保护的社会检查员妮娜·乌加罗娃注意到阿尔捷莫娃的车床附近不整齐。领班根据我们的请求，专门和她谈了怎样组织工作地点。妮娜逐渐地、一点一滴地获得了生产的技能、经验。
    从那个时候起过了几个月。不久前，妮娜走近我，说：“达玛拉，我想加入共产主义青年团。你怎样想——会接收吗？”
    我回答：“对，正确的决定。你现在是女斯大哈诺夫工作者，你完成着定额百分之一五○，你关心社会工作……我可以给你介绍。”
    在讨论妮娜的申请的会上，有许多我们生产组的组员。我们回想了，她的事情起初怎样没有妥贴，她怎样不相信某个时候能成为熟练的镟工。回想起所有这些，同她一起为她的成就而高兴。要知道这就是用共同的努力来培养出色的女生产者、自己事业的能手呵！
    哥比和秒钟
    我们工段上有一位调整手克拉夫治亚·阿列克施也夫娜·英萨科娃。她参加生产不只一年，并且熟悉事情。她工作又工作，把自己的经验传授青年，把技能教给人们。可是或者英萨科娃的性情特别，或者她懒散：她动作这样慢腾腾不着急，好像她不是站在车床旁边，而是在家里喝茶。
    姑娘们有时叫喊说：“克拉夫治亚，快点！我的车床坏了，我停歇啦。”
    她回答：“瞧，多机灵。你停一会，没有什么关系。停十分钟不会生大祸……”
    我们，积极分子们，不只一次同英萨科娃谈话，但都是徒劳。你向她谈，你提起停歇现象，她却回答：“你怎么能指示我。参加生产一年不满，也就成了女教师啦。我自己知道我要做的。”
    我们看到任何谈话都打不通英萨科娃，我去和领班商量。他说：“我也早就注意到，英萨科娃不很怎样努力，批评她也没有帮助。得下一个警告。……”
    我不喜欢这个意见。给警告不困难。可是能不能用什么另外办法帮助呢？我们记起了过几天我们将开生产会议。应该在那会上谈谈懈怠的调整手。我和积极分子们商量，她们也同意。会前我们郑重地准备了——选择了材料，考虑了几个车床女工的操作方法，作了必要的计算，当领班让我发言时，我开始有次序地讲话：
      “不久前我们总结了社会主义竞赛，明白我们的定额都超计划地完成了。大家都欢喜：多么好的工段呵！结果似乎一切潜在力量已经利用了，没有什么可再争取了。然而实际上是这样的吗？第十九次党代表大会决定在五年中减低工业产品成本约百分之二十五。这就是说，所有我们在生产中要进行最严格的节约。而我们怎样节约呢？举例来说，这是钻孔机女工祖巴列娃。她在一个星期中由于粗心弄坏了三个钻孔器。要知道每个值三个卢布。”
    我看见姑娘们在注意地听，我瞧一瞧纸，继续说：“还有，有时我们消耗的金属超过应该消耗的，贵重的工具由于缺乏经验或者粗心弄坏了，然而最大的损失，是时间的损失。这些损失常从英萨科娃那里发生。例如，不久前她花了一个半钟头来调整齿刮女工维佐夫金娜的车床，本来这在二十分钟内可以做完的。这就是说，白费了一个多钟头。英萨科娃认为这是小事。但是要知道维佐夫金娜在一个钟头内可以制造二十个环子。英萨科娃有过多少次这类小事呢？……”
    我刚报告完，镟工亚列克山得拉·别洛库罗娃请求说话。她是这样性格的人，向来第一个发言，并且向来说得有条理。她说：“我们全体说过要提前完成五年任务。这就是为什么我们计算着秒钟，关心着哥比。我们知道，由秒钟积累出小时，由哥比积累出卢布。可是看来，英萨科娃是不管这个事。她是阔绰的妇女：损失一小时是小事，减少完成定额的百分之十是细节。这对于生产有多么大害处，难道不明白吗？今天我们这样记录下来：英萨科娃不把生产放在心头，拖着生产组向后。……”
    其他的车床女工——妮娜·叶尔米索娃、沃里亚·帕何莫娃、玛丽亚·库琼佐娃，都发了言。领班也责备了英萨科娃。我们的英萨科娃脸红了，她坐在角落里不做声。当会议快结束时候，她请求说了话：“同志们，这次谈话对我不是白费的。我答应：不再重复自己的错误！”
    会开得好。倾心地谈了该谈的。以主人的态度分析了我们有什么样的潜在力量来提前完成五年任务，在生产的那儿可以节约。决定了减缩电力和工具的消耗，完全消灭时间的损失。女斯大哈诺夫工作者巴克什娜、库琼佐娃、乌加罗娃想出了好办法。她们提议了建立节约金属的联合生产组。在短期内生产组提出了五个合理化建议。这使我们一年节余一百吨金属。在二月份和三月份已经替国家节余了一大笔数目。我们的调整手英萨科娃也帮助了这个成就的取得。
    坚持精神
    不久前，委托我们生产组制造大批托架。但是装托架的包皮不知道为什么没有给。车床女工完成着工作，就把零件搁在车床旁边。短期内所有过道都堆满了托架。我们一下子变挤了，不舒服。当然，舒服不是主要的。姑娘们在换班时候有时得花一分钟离开车床，赶到库房或领班那里。如果你赶快走，你差点踢着脚。镟工妮娜·乌加罗娃看到这个，生气地说：“不像样子！我要求立刻整顿秩序。”
    她被我们这里选举做负责劳动保护的社会检查员。应该说，她热情地、诚心地做这件事。任何小事她也不放过。在工段上从上午起就听见她响亮的声音：“叶尔米索娃，你为什么不带保护眼镜？要知道刨屑会伤眼……。”日间，刚开始午饭休息，她就到车间工会委员会那里说：“究竟将在什么时候修理车间大门呢？我们那里有穿堂风，人们会伤风。”下午，下班后，她赶到工厂的医院里说：“我请求在我们的工段组织一次预防流行感冒的讲演……”一句话，妮娜是奋发的、刚毅的姑娘。她所进行的一切事情，总是热心地去做。
    可是这一次镰刀碰到了石头上。领班匆忙地听一下关于必须把托架从过道上搬走的话，挥挥手说：“没有什么，搁着吧！让车床女工们走路小心点，看着脚……”乌加罗娃跑到技师库尔斯基同志那里。他也没有听清楚这个积极分子的话，就说：“托架？你管这些小事，搁个把星期，然后我们再搬走……”
    乌加罗娃来和我商量。我们考虑了并且决定了一起找工段长波罗夫科夫同志。同他谈了，解释了我们的请求。波罗夫科夫同志回答：“技师是对的：现在有更重要的事情。过两三天我们保证给你们包皮……”我们等着。期限过了，什么也没有变化。向车间工会委员会诉说了。但车间工会委员会主席何捷托夫斯基同志说：“现在我不能帮什么，请你们等等。”
    说真话，我当时放松了。我想，看来现在简直没有可能搬走托架。是不是值得这样长久地过问这个问题，打断人家的工作，麻烦车间工会委员会呢？终归不是那么重要的事情……。我向乌加罗娃谈了这些，她却回答我：“为什么不值得过问？要知道，当托架搁在过道上的时候，眼看我们中间有人会碰伤。难道可以这样搁着！我到车间主任那里去！”
    我试图劝乌加罗娃。说服她说，车间主任斯托里雅罗夫同志一定已经知道我们的请求，他要有可能，早会给我包皮了。到那里做什么。我们差点争起来，她依然坚持自己的主张。刚上班，她就独自跑到斯托里雅罗夫那里去。当时我正忙着别的事情。
    第二天上午我来车间，看见工人们搬走着托架。我对妮娜说：“莫不是你争取到了？”她回答：
    “难道你没有看见。而且今天就给我们包皮。你说过：我白去……难道可以那样对待人们的健康？唉，你这个自由主义者！”
    我抱屈。可是我不做声。真的，我有什么话回答呢？实在说，妮娜是对的。从此以后我着实地晓得了：没有真正的坚持精神，是不会取得成功的。
                      （未完）
