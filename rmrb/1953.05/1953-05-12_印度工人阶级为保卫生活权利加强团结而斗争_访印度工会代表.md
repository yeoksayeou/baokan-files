    The representatives of various trade unions from the great Indian nation unanimously expressed the Indian people's friendship towards the Chinese people. The journalists were received by Yusuf, head of the delegation of the All-India Trade Union Congress (formerly translated as "All-India General Trade Union"), and Vice President of the All-India Trade Union Congress, and Satyapriya Banerjee, a member of the delegation and Vice President of the All-India Trade Union Congress. Suting Kumar Pramanik, head of the delegation of the United Trade Union Congress of India and member of the Presidium of the United Trade Union Congress of India. Shibnath Banerjee, head of the delegation of the Indian Labour Association and Chairman of the Indian Labour Association, and Keikika, member of the delegation and Vice Chairman of the Indian Labour Association. Guruswamy, head of the delegation of the All-India Railway Employees Federation and General Secretary of the All-India Railway Employees Federation.

    Yusuf and Satyapriya Banerjee, Vice Presidents of the All-India Trade Union Congress, first told us about the current living conditions of the Indian working class and their heroic strike struggles. Indian industry is a typical colonial industry, and the oppression and exploitation suffered by the Indian working class are extremely serious. Coupled with the continuous famines in recent years and the continuous rise in prices, the lives of Indian workers are constantly deteriorating. Many industries in India are currently facing crises. Due to competition from Japanese goods, Indian textiles and leather cannot find sales markets. In addition to the constant threat of unemployment and dismissal to workers in the machine textile industry in India, 2 million handicraft textile workers have already lost their jobs. In Bengal Province, 40,000 jute sack workers have been laid off and are unemployed. Under these circumstances, the Indian working class's strike movement against unemployment, dismissal, and hunger is constantly growing from all corners of the country. Two months ago, in Uttar Pradesh, 40,000 teachers (mostly primary school teachers) went on strike because their salaries were too low (and they had not been paid for six months). In this struggle, 500 male and female teachers were arrested, but the struggle has been persisting. Jute sack workers in Kanpur also held a strike. In Bengal Province, civil servants in many government agencies have also launched struggles to demand wage increases; many bank employees are brewing strikes to demand wage increases. In Uttar Pradesh, 30,000 scavengers and in Bengal Province, 20,000 seafarers also held strikes. The waves of strikes followed one after another.

    Shibnath Banerjee, Chairman of the Indian Labour Association, also believes that the unemployment and dismissal of Indian workers is a very serious problem. Because it is not only industrial workers who are threatened with unemployment, but also young intellectuals, government employees and bank employees. The unemployment of one worker is a threat to all workers. Recently, all aluminum factories in Bengal Province went on strike because 300 workers were dismissed.

    Suting Kumar Pramanik, member of the Presidium of the United Trade Union Congress, and Guruswamy, General Secretary of the Railway Employees Federation, also talked about the current situation of the Indian working class struggle. Pramanik said: The central task of the United Trade Union Congress is currently to fight against layoffs and demand increased wages, bonuses, and welfare. Guruswamy said: Indian railway workers have also actively launched strike struggles recently due to constant layoffs and wage cuts.

    In the Indian working class's struggle against unemployment, dismissal and demanding wage increases, a major issue is how to strengthen the unity of various Indian trade unions. Yusuf and Satyapriya Banerjee, Vice Presidents of the All-India Trade Union Congress, emphasized: Until now, there is no unified trade union organization in India. The heroic strike struggles held by Indian workers have not shown sufficient strength, mainly because everyone has not been well united. Then they said excitedly: It is gratifying that we have already started taking steps to strengthen unity. Suting Kumar Pramanik, member of the Presidium of the United Trade Union Congress, also excitedly talked about the issue of strengthening trade union unity. He said that the Indian working class is constantly striving to strengthen unity. Members of the All-India Trade Union Congress and the United Trade Union Congress have taken unified and united action in the movement against layoffs and the major seafarers' strike in Calcutta, and the Labor Association has also expressed its willingness to take joint action. Today, the Indian working class has realized from practical struggle experience that the division of trade unions directly harms the interests of workers. The voices of workers demanding unity are getting higher and higher, so he believes that it is possible to promote the unity of various trade unions. He told us that the United Trade Union held its annual meeting in March this year and made a resolution on the issue of unity.

    Shibnath Banerjee, Chairman of the Labor Association, used different wording to describe the issue of unity and joint action among trade unions, saying: The Indian Labor Association issued a declaration on this year's "May Day," calling for the establishment of a strong, united, independent, and democratic trade union, and the elimination of divisions among trade unions.

    Guruswamy, General Secretary of the Railway Employees Federation, told us that in order to strengthen the unity of the working class, the Railway Employees Federation will prepare to hold a meeting in mid-June this year to first call on railway workers to unite.

    During their short stay in New China, representatives of various Indian trade unions have shown great interest in all aspects of New China. Yusuf and Satyapriya Banerjee, representatives of the All-India Trade Union Congress, expressed their feelings with enthusiastic and poetic words of praise. They said: The first impression New China gave us was magnificent and great. Everywhere in China we see new life forces, whether it is children, young people or old people, they all show a precious and fresh life force. The "May Day" parade is a concrete manifestation of this force. They believe that the Chinese working class will build its motherland infinitely beautifully. They were very moved to see outstanding worker representatives from all over China enthusiastically discussing the national five-year plan at the 7th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. They said: Participating in this conference has brought us a great strength, that is, we know that our country will move in your direction.

    Pramanik, representative of the United Trade Union Congress of India, recalled the scene of watching the ceremony in front of Tiananmen on "May Day" and said: I have never seen such a large parade, it is a victorious army of a lively and powerful nation. From here, I saw that "May Day" in China has truly become a joyful day for the working people of the whole country. When I saw the huge crowd pouring through the great Tiananmen Square, it was truly an unforgettable moment for me.

    Shibnath Banerjee, representative of the Indian Labour Association, also felt excited when he talked about the joyful scenes shown by the Chinese people on the day of celebrating "May Day." He said: From the "May Day" parade, I not only saw a magnificent, enthusiastic, and young parade, but what particularly excited me was that from here I saw the enthusiasm of the Chinese people. The Chinese people used various symbols to express their love for peace, life, and their leaders. They held huge portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, held peace doves, as well as various beautiful bouquets and colorful air balloons, jumping, laughing, and walking through Tiananmen Square. Shibnath Banerjee also has a good impression of participating in the 7th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. He said: From the report of the conference, I know more clearly that you have done so much work in the past four years, your trade unions have made great achievements, and you have great strength among the masses. Your progress has moved me.

    Guruswamy, representative of the Railway Employees Federation, said: The convening of the 7th National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is not only a great meeting of Chinese workers, but also a workers' conference in Asia. Moreover, representatives from faraway Africa also attended this meeting, which allowed us to meet representatives from many countries, which is also of great significance for strengthening international worker solidarity. From this conference, we learned how to better learn from China. He said movingly: This trip to China has given us new strength and inspiration. He said, I have been to Europe and America, and now I have come to China. I know that some people in the United States are spreading the word about how the Chinese people are not free and are suffering, but I believe that if more people come to China, they will see the true situation in China, making this propaganda completely useless.

    The representatives of various Indian trade unions repeatedly thanked the Chinese trade unions for their invitation and warm hospitality. They said that this was a very meaningful visit.

    印度工人阶级为保卫生活权利加强团结而斗争
    ——访印度工会代表
    本报记者　柏生
    来自伟大的印度民族的各个工会的代表们，一致表达了印度人民对中国人民的友谊。接待记者访问的有全印工会大会（前译为“全印总工会”）代表团团长、全印工会大会副主席优素福，代表团团员、全印工会大会副主席萨蒂亚普里雅·班纳吉。印度统一工会大会代表团团长、印度统一工会大会主席团委员苏丁·库马尔·普拉马尼克。印度劳工协会代表团团长、印度劳工协会主席西布纳特·班纳吉，代表团团员、印度劳工协会副主席凯基卡。全印铁路员工联盟代表团团长、全印铁路员工联盟总书记古鲁斯瓦米。
    全印工会大会副主席优素福和萨蒂亚普里雅·班纳吉首先给我们讲述了印度工人阶级目前的生活情况和他们的英勇的罢工斗争。印度工业是典型的殖民地工业，印度工人阶级所受的压迫和剥削是异常严重的，加上最近几年来的连年饥荒，以及物价的不断上涨，因此印度工人的生活是在不断地恶化着。目前印度许多工业面临着危机。因为日本货物的竞争，印度的纺织品、皮革都找不到销售市场。印度纺织工业除机器纺织工人不断遭到失业和解雇的威胁外，已有二百万手工业纺织工人遭到了失业，在孟加拉省已有四万织麻袋工人被解雇而失业。在这种情况下，印度工人阶级反对失业、反对解雇、反对饥饿的罢工运动就从全国各个角落不断地增长起来了。两个月前，在联合省有四万教师（大部是小学教师），因为薪金太低（并且已有六个月没发薪金）起来罢教。在这次斗争中，有五百名男女教师被逮捕起来，但斗争一直在坚持着。在康普尔地方的织麻袋工人也同样举行了罢工。在孟加拉省许多机关里的公务人员，为要求增加工资也展开了斗争；许多银行雇员因为要求增加工资，也在酝酿罢工。在联合省有三万名清道夫、在孟加拉省有两万海员工人也举行了罢工。罢工的声浪就这样一个接着一个地跟了上来。
    印度劳工协会主席西布纳特·班纳吉也认为目前印度工人的失业、解雇是一个很严重的问题。因为遭到失业威胁的不光是产业工人，还有青年知识分子，机关职员和银行雇员。一个工人的失业对所有的工人都是威胁。最近孟加拉省所有的铝工厂，因为有三百名工人被解雇，全体铝工厂的工人都起来罢工。
    统一工会大会主席团委员苏丁·库马尔·普拉马尼克和铁路员工联盟总书记古鲁斯瓦米也谈到目前印度工人阶级斗争的情形。普拉马尼克说：目前统一工会大会的中心工作，就是为反对解雇、要求增加工资、红利、福利而进行斗争。古鲁斯瓦米说：印度铁路工人最近因不断发生解雇、减薪等事情，也积极地展开了罢工斗争。
    在印度工人阶级反对失业、解雇和要求增加工资的斗争中，一个最主要的问题是印度各个工会如何加强团结的问题。全印工会大会副主席优素福和萨蒂亚普里雅·班纳吉强调指出：直到现在印度还没有一个统一的工会组织。印度工人举行的英勇罢工斗争，所以还显得没有足够的力量，主要是因为大家还没有很好地团结在一起。接着他们兴奋地说：值得高兴的是我们都已开始采取了加强团结的步骤。统一工会大会主席团委员苏丁·库马尔·普拉马尼克也兴奋地讲起了加强工会团结的问题。他说，目前印度工人阶级正在不断地为加强团结而努力。全印工会大会和统一工会大会的会员在加尔各答反对解雇和海员大罢工的运动中，已经采取了统一和团结的行动，劳工协会也曾表示要采取联合行动。今天印度工人阶级已经从实际斗争经验中认识了工会的分裂直接损害着工人的利益。工人们要求统一团结的声浪愈来愈高，因此他相信促成各个工会的团结是可能的。他告诉我们，今年三月间统一工会举行的年会上，曾经作出了关于统一和团结问题的决议。
    劳工协会主席西布纳特·班纳吉用另外一种措词来代替说明各工会间的团结和联合行动的问题，他说：印度劳工协会在今年“五一”节发表了一篇宣言，要求建立一个强大的、团结的、独立的、民主的工会，取消工会间的分歧。
    铁路员工联盟总书记古鲁斯瓦米告诉我们，为了加强工人阶级的团结，今年六月中旬，铁路员工联盟将准备召开一次会议，首先号召铁路工人团结起来。
    印度各个工会的代表，在来到新中国的短短的一段时间里，对新中国各方面都表现了极大的兴趣。全印工会大会代表优素福和萨蒂亚普里雅·班纳吉充满着热情地用诗意的赞美话语表达了他们的心情。他们说：新中国给我们的第一个印象就是雄壮的、伟大的。在中国我们到处看到新的生命力量，无论是孩子们、青年人或老年人，从他们身上都显示着一种宝贵的新鲜的生命力量。“五一”节的大游行，也正是这种力量的具体表现。他们相信中国的工人阶级是会把自己的祖国建设得无限美好的。在参加中国工会第七次全国代表大会中，看到来自中国各地的优秀工人代表，热烈讨论国家五年计划的情景，使他们非常感动。他们说：参加了这个大会给我们带来了一种伟大的力量，那就是我们知道我们的国家将向着你们的方向前进。
    印度统一工会大会代表普拉马尼克，回忆“五一”节在天安门前观礼时的情景说：我从来没有看到像这样大的游行队伍，这是一支活泼有力的民族的胜利军。从这里我看到“五一”节在中国已经真正成为全国劳动人民自己的欢乐的日子。当我看到巨大的人流涌过伟大的天安门广场时，这真是使我永难忘怀的一刻。
    印度劳工协会代表西布纳特·班纳吉谈到中国人民在庆祝“五一”节那天所表现的欢乐的情景也感到兴奋，他说：从“五一”节的游行，我不仅看到了雄伟的、热情的、年青的游行队伍，尤其使我兴奋的是，从这里我看到了中国人民的积极性，中国人民用各种象征来表现他们对和平对生命对自己领袖的热爱，他们举着中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席的巨幅画像、举着和平鸽、以及各种美丽的花束、彩色的轻气球，跳跃着、欢笑着走过了天安门广场。西布纳特·班纳吉对参加中国工会第七次全国代表大会也有良好的印象。他说：从大会的报告中，使我更清楚地知道你们四年来是做了那么多的工作，你们工会有了很大的成绩，而且在群众中有了很大的力量。你们的进步，使我感动。
    铁路员工联盟代表古鲁斯瓦米说：中国工会第七次全国代表大会的召开，不仅是中国工人的一个伟大会议，也是亚洲的一个工人大会。而且在这个会上还有来自遥远的非洲的代表们，这使我们能和许多国家的代表们相会，这对加强国际工人团结也是具有很大意义的。从这次大会上，使我们懂得怎样更好地学习中国。他感动地说：这次到中国来，使我们增加了新的力量和启示。他说，我曾经到过欧洲和美洲，现在又来到中国。我知道美国有一部分人正在宣传中国人民如何不自由，如何在受着苦难，但是我相信，如果有更多的人来到中国，他们将会看到中国的真实情况，使这种宣传完全无用。
    印度各工会的代表们一再感谢中国工会对他们这次的邀请和热情的招待。他们表示这是一次很有意义的访问。
