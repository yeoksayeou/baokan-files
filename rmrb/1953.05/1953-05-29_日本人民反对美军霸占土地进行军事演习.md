Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: The Japanese people strongly oppose the US military's occupation of land for military exercises.

The US military authorities recently announced that they would use Mount Asama (located between Nagano and Gunma prefectures), a world-renowned area for studying volcanoes and earthquakes, as a mountain warfare training base. This plan was immediately opposed by local residents and the Japanese scientific community. Staff members of the Tokyo University Earthquake Research Institute's volcanic observation station at Mount Asama and the Seismological Society of Japan petitioned the US-Japan Joint Committee, requesting the US military to cancel the plan to use Mount Asama as a training base. However, this request was rudely rejected by the US military authorities.

This arrogant attitude of the US military, which insists on disrupting Japanese scientific research, has further aroused the anger and opposition of the Japanese scientific community. On the 19th, the Tokyo University Earthquake Research Institute resolved to resolutely oppose the US military's use of Mount Asama as a training base in order to protect the Japanese people's right to conduct scientific research. Related groups such as the Seismological Society of Japan, the Science Council of Japan, and the Geophysics Research Liaison Committee have also decided to launch a strong opposition movement. The Tokyo University Earthquake Research Institute stated that if this issue remains unresolved, it will be submitted to the International Geophysical Conference scheduled to be held in Rome in 1954, to be condemned by the global academic research community. Kyodo News Agency said that the Mount Asama issue "has developed into a major global issue of safeguarding the freedom of academic research."

In Ishikawa Prefecture, the struggle against the US military's permanent occupation of the Uchinada Village in the prefecture as a firing range has developed into a prefecture-wide movement, involving everyone from the governor to ordinary people. After the Ishikawa Prefectural Assembly passed a resolution on the 15th opposing the US military's permanent use of Uchinada Village as a firing range, Ishikawa Prefecture has successively sent delegations to Tokyo to petition and protest. The first delegation, led by Ishikawa Prefecture Governor Kazuo Shibano, included representatives from the Prefectural Assembly, women's groups, and the Uchinada Village Assembly, arrived in Tokyo on the 25th. Carrying white cloth banners with the slogan "Oppose Permanent Seizure of the Base," they petitioned the National Diet and members of various political parties, and denounced the suffering brought to the local people by the US military's use of the Uchinada firing range. On the 26th, the second delegation, led by the Speaker of the Ishikawa Prefectural Assembly, also arrived in Tokyo. After meeting with the first delegation, they are continuing to petition and protest to the relevant parties.

    日本人民反对美军霸占土地进行军事演习
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：日本人民强烈反对美军霸占土地进行军事演习。
    美军当局在不久以前曾宣布要以世界知名的研究火山和地震的地区——浅间山（在长野县和群马县之间）作为山地战演习基地。这一计划宣布后，马上遭到当地居民和日本科学界的反对。东京大学地震研究所设在浅间山的火山观测所的工作人员和日本地震学会分别向美日联合委员会请愿，要求美军取消以浅间山为演习基地的计划。但是，这个要求遭到美军当局的蛮横的拒绝。
    美军这种坚持破坏日本科学研究工作的蛮横态度，进一步激起日本科学界的愤怒和反对。东京大学地震研究所在十九日决议为了保卫日本人民研究科学的权利，坚决反对美军以浅间山作为演习基地。日本地震学会、日本学术会议和地球物理研究联络委员会等有关团体，也决定要展开一个强烈的反对运动。东京大学地震研究所表示：如果这一问题仍然得不到解决，将提交到预定于一九五四年在罗马举行的国际地球物理会议，向全世界学术研究界进行控诉。共同社说：浅间山问题“已经发展成为维护学术研究自由的很大的世界性问题了”。
    在石川县，反对美军永久占用该县的内滩村为打靶场的斗争，已经发展成为全县性的运动，从知事（县长）到普通老百姓都卷入了这个运动。在石川县县议会于十五日通过决议反对美军永久使用内滩村作为打靶场之后，石川县并接连派出代表团，到东京去请愿和抗议。第一批代表团以石川县知事柴野和喜夫为首，包括县议会、妇女团体和内滩村村议会等团体代表，在二十五日到达东京。他们带着“反对永久接管基地”的白布标语，向国会和各党派议员进行请愿，并控诉美军使用内滩打靶场所带给当地人民的苦难。二十六日，以石川县县议会议长为首的第二批代表团也抵达东京。他们和第一批代表团会合后，正继续向有关方面进行请愿和抗议。
