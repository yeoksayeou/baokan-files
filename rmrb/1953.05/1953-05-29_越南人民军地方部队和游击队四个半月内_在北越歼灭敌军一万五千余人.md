Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, May 27th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, in the first four and a half months of this year, the Vietnamese People's Army's local forces and guerrillas annihilated more than 15,000 enemy troops on the North Vietnamese battlefield.

    Greatly encouraged by the victories of last autumn and winter, the Vietnamese local People's Army and guerrillas have been intensifying operations on battlefields throughout the country. In North Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army, taking advantage of the enemy's passive position, has conducted continuous battles, each time annihilating one to three companies of enemy troops. The People's Army also carried out a series of surprise attacks on the enemy-occupied cities of Jian'an, Haiyang, Nandinh, and Ningping, eliminating most of the enemy's active forces and destroying many ammunition depots and warehouses.

    In order to cope with the People's Army's offensive, the enemy launched several "sweeps" in the provinces of Ningping, Qinghua, Beijiang, and Guang'an, but all of these "sweeps" were crushed, and the enemy suffered severe losses.

    From January to mid-May, in four and a half months, the Vietnamese People's Army's local forces and guerrillas conducted 1,037 battles of various sizes, eliminating 15,103 enemy troops, including six majors and 109 other officers. Among the enemy troops annihilated, 4,077 were captured, 9,576 were killed, and 1,450 were wounded.

    The People's Army seized 3,141 rifles, 948 machine guns, 34 mortars, and more than 44 tons of ammunition and equipment. They shot down and damaged six enemy aircraft, destroyed 27 tanks, 568 military vehicles, and seven naval vessels, and destroyed more than 3,000 tons of ammunition, 18 artillery pieces, one power plant, and a large amount of gasoline.

    To coordinate with the battles in the North Vietnam battlefield, the People's Army's local forces and guerrillas in Central and South Vietnam also intensified operations, removing 15 enemy strongholds and inflicting significant casualties on the enemy. For example, People's Army units eliminated about 60 enemy officers and soldiers in a surprise attack on Fanche City in central Vietnam; in the anti-"sweep" battle in Guangtian, Chengtian Province, they eliminated four enemy companies. In the watery plains of South Vietnam, People's Army soldiers sank four enemy naval vessels, killing and wounding hundreds of enemy troops.

    The victories on various battlefields in Vietnam, especially the victories in the North Vietnam battlefield, prove that the combat effectiveness of the Vietnamese armed forces has been further improved after the ideological transformation and military training movement.

    越南人民军地方部队和游击队四个半月内
    在北越歼灭敌军一万五千余人
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十七日讯：在今年的头四个半月中，越南人民军地方部队和游击队在北越战场上共消灭敌军一万五千多人。
    在去年秋季和冬季的胜利的巨大鼓舞下，越南地方人民军和游击队一直在全国战场上加紧作战。在北越，越南人民军地方部队利用敌军的被动地位，连续进行了多次战斗，每次战斗歼灭敌军一个连到三个连不等。人民军并对建安、海阳、南定、宁平的各个敌军占领的城市进行了一连串的奇袭，消灭敌军的大部分有生力量，击毁许多弹药库和仓库。
    为了应付人民军的进攻，敌军在宁平、清化、北江、广安等省发动多次的“扫荡”，但是所有这些“扫荡”都被粉碎了，敌军受到严重的损失。
    从一月到五月中旬的四个半月中，越南人民军地方部队和游击队进行了一千零三十七次大小战斗，消灭敌军一万五千一百零三人，其中有六个少校和一百零九个其他的军官。在被歼的敌军中有：四千零七十七人被俘，九千五百七十六人被打死，一千四百五十人被打伤。
    人民军缴获步枪三千一百四十一支、机枪九百四十八挺、迫击炮三十四门、弹药和装备四十四吨以上。击落、击伤敌机六架，击毁坦克二十七辆、军用车辆五百六十八辆、海军船舰七艘，摧毁弹药三千余吨、大炮十八门、电厂一处，以及大量的汽油。
    为了配合北越战场的战斗，中越和南越的人民军地方部队和游击队也加紧作战，拔除了十五个敌军据点，并给了敌人以重大杀伤。例如，人民军部队在奇袭中越南部藩切城的战斗中，消灭敌军军官和军士约六十人；在承天省广田的反“扫荡”战中，又消灭了敌军四个连。在南越水草平原，人民军战士击沉敌军海军船舰四艘，杀伤敌军数百人。
    越南各个战场的胜利，尤其是北越战场的胜利，证明越南的武装部队在经过了思想改造和军事训练的运动以后，战斗力又有了进一步的提高。
