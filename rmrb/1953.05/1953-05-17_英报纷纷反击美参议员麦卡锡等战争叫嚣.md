Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th Dispatch: British newspapers have been commenting on the attacks by U.S. Senators McCarthy, Nolan, etc., on British Prime Minister Churchill and Labour Party leader Attlee's speeches in the British House of Commons.

    On the 14th, McCarthy attacked Britain's attitude towards the Korean War, saying: "If anyone tries to blackmail us into accepting a Communist peace on the grounds that Britain will withdraw otherwise, we can go it alone." He shouted: "Let them get out, goddamn it!" The "Daily Mirror" commented on the 15th that Churchill and Attlee expressed the British people's "serious uneasiness about the way Americans handle world affairs." "The British have the right to criticize. We are not a vassal state. We cannot allow others to lead us by the nose." The "Daily Mirror" said: "If the United States wants a blind, silent, and obedient ally, we warn the President and Mr. McCarthy that they have chosen the wrong country in Britain." "Britain does not apologize to him, nor to anyone in the United States, for speaking honestly. We think these words should have been said long ago."

    The "Daily Herald" said: "It is not difficult to understand that Attlee's frank words and Churchill's speech will shock some Americans. They are not accustomed to hearing Britain express its opinions on international affairs bravely and clearly." As far as the British people are concerned, there is no doubt about their reaction to the two speeches, they are all excited and encouraged. They will insist that the British government continue to implement its proposals for seeking a peaceful solution to the problems between communist and non-communist countries."

    Some British newspapers emphasized that Britain should break away from American control and not follow the policies pursued by the United States. The "Daily Express" pointed out in its commentary on the 14th that "U.S. aid" has made Britain lose its independence, it said: "Britain should now tell the United States that it does not want anything at all, only independence."

    Prior to this, Jennie Lee, the wife of Bevan, the leader of the left wing of the British Labour Party, said on the 12th that Britain's contribution to international affairs "has been drowned out by the clinking of dollars falling into beggar's bowls." Britain cannot hope to play its proper role in the world unless the government says to the United States in a polite tone: "Thank you very much, but we no longer intend to play the role of a beggar in the world."

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th Dispatch, TASS: President Eisenhower, at a press conference, answering a reporter's question about his opinion on Churchill's proposal to hold an international conference, said that he agreed with the statement issued by the State Department on May 13.

    Regarding Attlee's statement that some people in the United States do not want peace, Eisenhower said: "I have not met anyone in the United States who does not want peace."

    Eisenhower said that he did not object to Churchill's proposal, but first of all, all parties must have proof of sincerity.

    But he also said that he was unwilling to say that unless some action was taken, he would not attend such a meeting.

    A reporter asked him what he thought of the proposal that the Chinese government should participate in the United Nations Security Council. He said that different countries have different interpretations of what recognition means. Eisenhower said that in the United States, recognition has always meant acquiescence, while in other places, recognition only means recognition of the ruling regime.

    Eisenhower said that based on the above, it seems that there is not such a big rift between British and American policies as it seems on the surface.

    英报纷纷反击美参议员麦卡锡等战争叫嚣
    【新华社十六日讯】伦敦消息：英国报纸纷纷评论美国参议员麦卡锡、诺兰等对英国首相邱吉尔和工党领袖艾德礼在英国下院演说的攻击。
    麦卡锡于十四日攻击英国对朝鲜战争的态度说：“假如有人企图以不然英国要退出为理由来要挟我们接受共产党的和平的话，那我们是能够单独干下去的。”他大声叫道：“让他们退出好了，他妈的！” “每日镜报”十五日发表评论说：邱吉尔和艾德礼表达了英国人“对于美国人处理世界事务所感到的严重不安情绪”。“英国人有权进行批评。我们不是附庸国。我们不能听凭别人牵着我们的鼻子走”。“每日镜报”说：“如果美国要找一个盲目的、闭口的与唯命是从的盟国，我们警告总统与麦卡锡先生，他们挑上英国是挑错国家了。”“英国不对他道歉，也不对美国任何人道歉，因为说的是老老实实的话。我们认为这些话早就应该说了。”
    每日先驱报说：“艾德礼的坦白言词和邱吉尔的演说会使一些美国人震动不已，那是不难了解的。他们不习惯于听取英国就国际事务所勇敢地明确地发表的意见。”就英国人民来说，他们对两人演说的反应根本不用怀疑，他们都感到兴奋鼓舞。他们将坚持要英国政府继续贯彻它的寻求和平解决共产党和非共产党国家之间的问题的建议。”
    英国的若干报纸强调英国应当摆脱美国的控制，不要追随美国所奉行的政策。“每日快报”在十四日的评论中指出“美援”使英国失去了独立性，它说：“英国现在应该告诉美国说，它根本不想要任何东西，只想独立自主。”
    在此之前，英国工党左翼领袖比万的夫人珍尼·李在十二日说：英国对国际事务的贡献，“都被美元落在乞丐碗里的叮当声所掩没了”。英国不可能希望在世界上起它应起的作用，除非政府以一种彬彬有礼的口吻对美国说：“很感谢你，但是我们不再打算在世界上扮演一种叫化子的角色了。”
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿十五日讯：艾森豪威尔总统在记者招待会上答复记者向他提出的对邱吉尔所提举行国际会议的建议有什么意见说，他同意国务院五月十三日发表的声明。
    关于艾德礼所说的美国有人不希望和平一节，艾森豪威尔说：“我在美国没有遇到过不愿意和平的人。”
    艾森豪威尔说，他不反对邱吉尔的建议，但是首先各方要有诚意的证明。
    可是他又说，他不愿意这样说，即除非作出了某种行动，否则他就不参加这种会议。
    有记者问他对中国政府应当参加联合国安全理事会的建议有什么意见，他说，承认是什么意思，不同的国家有不同的解释。艾森豪威尔说，在美国，承认一向是默许的意思，而在另一些地方，承认只是意味着承认当政的政权。
    艾森豪威尔说，根据上述情况看来，英国和美国的政策之间，并不像表面上看来那样有很大的裂痕。
