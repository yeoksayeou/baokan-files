Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th. Our correspondent reports: Regarding the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, our side had completed the repatriation of the other side's sick and wounded prisoners of war fit for travel by April 26th. The US side, after repatriating 185 of our sick and wounded prisoners of war on May 3rd, has declared the repatriation completed.

During this repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, our side repatriated a total of 149 American prisoners of war, 32 British prisoners of war, 15 Turkish prisoners of war, 6 Colombian prisoners of war, 5 Australian prisoners of war, 2 Canadian prisoners of war, and 1 prisoner of war each from the Philippines, the Union of South Africa, the Netherlands, and Greece, and 471 Korean prisoners of war. Our side has repatriated all 684 sick and wounded prisoners of war under our custody who are fit for travel, including the sick and wounded prisoners of war recently captured at the front. The actual number repatriated by our side is 14 percent higher than the estimated number originally notified to the US side, of which the number of non-Korean nationals increased by 42 percent. In fourteen days, a total of 5,640 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 1,030 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers returned to the embrace of the motherland.

During this repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war, sharp contrasts were formed between the two sides in many aspects. The enemy prisoners of war repatriated by our side, judging from their muscles and complexion, showed that they had been well-nourished and received adequate medical care in our prisoner of war camps. On the contrary, the vast majority of our repatriated prisoners of war were sallow and emaciated, physically weak, and a very large proportion suffered from serious illnesses and injuries. According to statistics from a certain hospital, among internal medicine patients, those suffering from respiratory diseases accounted for 80 percent, and among them, tuberculosis patients accounted for 76 percent; among surgical patients, amputations accounted for 28 percent of the injured, and what was particularly shocking was that the number of amputations due to frostbite accounted for 92 percent of the number of frostbite cases. This shows that our captured personnel in the US prisoner of war camps not only did not receive the medical treatment they deserved, nor did they receive basic nutrition, but also suffered various abuses and tortures.

Enemy prisoners of war, both in the prisoner of war camps and on the way to repatriation, received humane treatment and good care, so that before they passed through Panmunjom to return, they waved, greeted, smiled, thanked, and bid farewell to our personnel for the last time. However, our captured personnel were even attacked with poison gas bombs by the US military on the eve and during the repatriation, and repeatedly went on hunger strikes because they could not eat the moldy "food." Therefore, as soon as they returned to our reception area, they threw the things that the US side had temporarily forced on them fiercely on the ground, and poured out to our personnel all kinds of atrocities in the enemy's prisoner of war camps. Waving countless Chinese flags and singing songs of the motherland, they returned to the embrace of the motherland. Each batch of returning sick and wounded soldiers vividly demonstrated the strong will of our captured personnel to oppose forced detention and demand to return to the motherland.

Our captured personnel are recuperating in temporary hospitals in Kaesong. Because they have returned to the kind care of their own people, coupled with careful treatment, adequate nutrition, and a happy spiritual life, their health has improved. After a short period of recuperation in Kaesong, they will be transferred to rear hospitals for thorough recuperation and return home to live a peaceful life. However, according to reports from US and British news agencies, the Korean prisoners of war who returned through the so-called "Freedom Village" in Munsan have been sent by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to concentration camps, where they will be imprisoned for at least six months, and they are even prohibited from communicating with family members and friends. Many American prisoners of war have been escorted by large numbers of "Central Intelligence Agency" agents to US military "hospitals" for long-term "psychiatric treatment" because they have "contracted communism." In fact, it is only because the US side is afraid that they will truthfully tell the truth about the good treatment they received in our prisoner of war camps.

### 双方遣返病伤战俘的情形形成强烈的对照

    双方遣返病伤战俘的情形形成强烈的对照
     【新华社开城四日电】本社记者报道：关于遣返病伤战俘事宜，我方已于四月二十六日将适于旅行的对方病伤战俘遣返完毕，美方于五月三日遣返我方病伤战俘一百八十五人后，已声称遣返完毕。
    在这次的病伤战俘遣返中，我方共遣返美国籍战俘一百四十九人，英国籍战俘三十二人，土耳其籍战俘十五人，哥伦比亚籍战俘六人，澳大利亚籍战俘五人，加拿大籍战俘二人，菲律宾、南非联邦、荷兰和希腊籍战俘各一人，朝鲜籍战俘四百七十一人。我方已遣返了除病伤情况不适宜于旅行之外的我方收容下的全部六百八十四名病伤战俘，连最近在前方俘获的病伤战俘都已包括在内。我方实际遣返的数字比较原来通知美方的概数增加百分之十四，其中非朝鲜籍的增加百分之四十二。十四天中，共有朝鲜人民军被俘人员五千六百四十人，中国人民志愿军被俘人员一千零三十人重返祖国怀抱。
    这次病伤战俘遣返中，双方在许多方面都形成强烈的对照。我方遣返的对方被俘人员，从他们的肌肉和面色可以看出他们在我方战俘营中营养良好、医疗充分。相反的，被遣返的我方被俘人员绝大多数都是面黄肌瘦，身体虚弱，重病和重伤所占的比例极大。据某医院统计，在内科病人中患呼吸系统病的占百分之八十，而其中肺结核患者又占百分之七十六；在外科病人中，截肢人数占伤员人数的百分之二十八，尤其惊人的是因冻伤而截肢的人数竟占冻伤人数的百分之九十二。这说明了我方被俘人员在美国战俘营中不但没有得到应有的医药治疗，没有得到起码的营养，而且受到各种虐待和摧残。
    对方战俘无论在战俘营中和遣返的路上，都受到人道待遇和良好治疗，因此在他们经过板门店回去以前，还最后地向我方人员挥手、打招呼、含笑致谢和告别。而我方被俘人员则甚至在遣返的前夕和途中还被美军用毒气弹攻击，还因为吃不下霉烂的“饭”而一再绝食。因此，当他们一回到我方接收区，便把美方临时强迫发给的东西狠狠地丢在地上，向我方人员倾诉敌方战俘营中的种种暴行。他们挥动着无数面朝中国旗，唱着祖国的歌曲，回到祖国怀抱。每一批归来的病伤员都生动地表现出我方被俘人员反对强迫扣留、要求重回祖国的坚强意志。
    我方被俘人员正在开城的各临时医院疗养，因为重新回到自己人的亲切照顾之下，加上细心的治疗、充分的营养和愉快的精神生活，他们的健康状况已有起色。他们在开城再作短期休养后，将转至后方医院彻底疗养，回家过和平生活。而经过美方在汶山所谓“自由村”回去的战俘，根据美英通讯社的报道，朝鲜籍的已被李伪匪帮送进集中营，至少囚禁六个月，他们甚至于被禁止和家属及友人通信。美国籍的许多战俘，已被大批“中央情报局”的特务押送到美军“医院”去进行长期的“精神治疗”，因为他们“传染了共产主义”，事实上不过是因为美方害怕他们如实地说出他们在我方战俘营中所受到的良好待遇的情况。
