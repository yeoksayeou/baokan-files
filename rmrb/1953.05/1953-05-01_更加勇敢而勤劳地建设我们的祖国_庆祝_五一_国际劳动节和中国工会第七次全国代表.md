　　In the first year of the great period of new economic construction in our country, as we greet "May Day" International Labor Day, we feel an incomparably glorious historical task is falling on our shoulders. This is to gradually realize the industrialization of the country in our agricultural country where small-scale production occupies an absolute advantage. Our country's New Democracy is a transitional period toward socialization. The process of gradually realizing the industrialization of our country is the process of gradually carrying out socialist transformation of our national economy. This great historical task of national industrialization requires us to fully mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to invest in the front line of national economic construction, in accordance with the needs and possible conditions.

　　We must not forget that one of the important reasons why China was wantonly plundered by imperialists in the past was that China had no industry, especially no heavy industry and national defense industry foundation. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Coalition Government," based on the history of more than 100 years since the Opium War in 1840, especially the historical experience of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule: "Without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong clearly stipulated the industrialization of New China and the historical tasks of the Chinese working class at that time. Comrade Mao Zedong said:

　　“After the political conditions of New Democracy are obtained, the Chinese people and their
　　government must take practical steps to gradually establish heavy
　　industry and light industry in a few years, so that China can change from an agricultural country to an industrial country. The New Democratic
　　state cannot be consolidated without a solid economic foundation,
　　without a progressive agriculture that is more developed than it is now, and without large-scale industry that occupies a dominant position in the national economy, as well as transportation,
　　trade, finance and other undertakings that are adapted to it.
　　…The task of the Chinese working class is not only to fight for the establishment of a New Democratic
　　state, but also to fight for China's industrialization and agricultural
　　modernization.”

　　Today, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and bravely shoulder the great task of our country's economic construction centered on industry.

　　In the past three years, our country's economic recovery work has been basically completed. Various democratic social reforms have also generally come to an end successively. The land reform has completely destroyed the feudal economic foundation in areas with a population of about 400 million, liberating the productive forces of the vast number of peasants; the completion of the democratic reform of state-owned factories, mines, and enterprises has made workers truly the masters of the enterprise, and their production enthusiasm and creativity have rapidly increased; the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement has basically eliminated the remaining reactionary forces; the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements have largely cleared up the pollution left over from the old society, repelled the attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, and consolidated the leading position of the socialist economy. Due to these reforms, especially the workers' increase production and practice economy campaign, our country's economic and financial situation, even while carrying out the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, has fundamentally improved earlier than expected. These have largely made the conditions for our country to start new economic construction now.

　　This new economic construction must be centered on industry, especially heavy industry, based on the needs of the domestic market, especially the peasant market, based on the scale of our country's resources and technical conditions, and also based on the speed of capital accumulation, to carry out basic construction rationally and in a planned way, develop new enterprises, transform existing enterprises, and develop transportation. We must improve and improve agricultural production, develop farmers' mutual assistance and cooperation step by step, and improve and develop handicraft production; at the same time, we must develop state-owned commerce and cooperative trade, smooth the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and improve the material and cultural life of workers and other working people on the basis of developing production. We must cultivate a large number of construction talents and strive to learn from the advanced theories and science and technology of the Soviet Union in order to build our country. The power of the Chinese working class plays a decisive role in this construction cause. As long as our working class and all the working people unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate the unity of the people of the whole country, and play a leading and exemplary role in construction work, enthusiastically launch labor competitions, ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the country's economic construction plan, then our country's construction cause will surely be successful.

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the mass organization of the working class, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Chinese workers have proven themselves to be the great pioneers of China's construction cause in the past three years. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has successfully organized extensive labor competitions among the workers, with employees participating in the competition accounting for about 80% of the total number of employees, and more than 223,000 labor models have emerged from the employees participating in the competition in the past three years. Our country's economic recovery is the result of this enthusiastic labor competition. The current central task of our country's workers' movement and trade union work is to continue to deepen the development of sound and regular labor competitions, so as to strengthen labor discipline, promote rationalization proposals and advanced experience, improve labor productivity, tap the potential of enterprises, achieve the purpose of increasing product quantity, improving product quality, reducing production costs, ensuring production safety, and completing and overfulfilling production plans.

　　Labor competition is the basic method for the working class to develop its own production. In the "Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" in June 1930, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The benefit of competition is that it creates a fundamental change in people's views on labor, because it changes labor from a previously considered despicable, arduous burden into a glorious, honorable, heroic, and courageous undertaking." The labor competition in the Soviet Union's socialist and communist construction was developed in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions. We should also organize and lead our labor competitions in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions and learn from the Soviet Union's experience.

　　To organize and lead labor competitions, there must first be a production plan. Competition without a production plan is bound to be formalism. Therefore, workers, technicians, and staff members of all factories, mines, and enterprises must actively participate in discussing and formulating production plans. In accordance with the indicators of the plan, we must study various methods to improve the utilization rate of existing equipment, save raw materials, improve labor organization, improve the production process, and improve production tools, and purposefully put forward rationalization proposals and formulate advanced production plans that can increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. Each workshop, group, and individual must put forward competitive conditions to ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the plan in accordance with the plan; and in accordance with the specific situation, establish collective contracts and linked contracts from simple to complex, so that the masses can consciously complete the production plan through collective labor. In this process, the primary task of the leadership is to actively discover and support all advanced new things, cultivate typical examples, summarize and promote advanced experiences, improve technical operating procedures in a timely manner, and through practical experience, raise the backward to the advanced level, so that the labor competition can continue to move forward.

　　The development of such extensive mass labor competitions must be carried out through certain organizational forms, and the best forms are production meetings and collective contracts. The work of leading labor competitions can only achieve the greatest results when combined with the creative activities of the workers, combined with rationalization proposals, and combined with the workers' immediate interests.

　　Ensuring the material and cultural life of employees and carrying out communist education for employees are two other basic tasks of trade union work. These two tasks serve the development of production and are necessary for the development of production. On the issue of employee welfare, we must resolutely overcome the current bureaucratic tendency of neglecting employee welfare, and at the same time resolutely overcome the economicist tendency of unilaterally and excessively emphasizing employee welfare regardless of production interests. We must continue to continuously improve the political consciousness of the working class and educate the workers to become fighters who strive for the great future of national industrialization and communism.

　　The economic construction cause of our great motherland is not only the cause of the working class, but also the common cause of the people of the whole country. Let the people of the whole country, regardless of workers, peasants, herdsmen, fishermen, salt workers, boat people, handicraftsmen, trade workers, cooperative workers, staff members of state organs and people's organizations, youth, students, women, educators, scientific and technological workers, medical and health workers, literary and art workers, industrialists and businessmen, and shop assistants, all democratic parties, all groups, all nationalities, all strata, and people of various religious beliefs, unite together under the great banner of patriotism to build our country. As early as when the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference opened in 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong had already said: "Our nation will henceforth be included in the big family of all peace-loving and freedom-loving nations in the world, working with a courageous and diligent attitude, creating its own civilization and happiness, and at the same time promoting world peace and freedom." Now that the cause of national construction has been placed before us, we must build our motherland more bravely and diligently, create our own civilization and happiness, and promote world peace and freedom.

　　We deeply understand that our cause is inseparable from the cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism, and is closely related to the cause of all peace-loving people in the world. The reason why we can restore and develop our country's economy so rapidly is that, in addition to the courageous and diligent efforts of our country's working class and the people of the whole country, the fraternal and selfless assistance given to our country by the great Soviet Union is of decisive significance. The Soviet Union's assistance will have even greater significance for our country's future construction. Comrade Malenkov said in his speech at the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet government will continue to cooperate closely with the great Chinese people and the people of all people's democratic countries in politics and economy, and strengthen its fraternal friendship and unity with them." This friendship and unity is unbreakable and is the guarantee of all our victories. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "The Greatest Friendship": "For thirty years, Comrade Stalin's theory and the example of the Soviet Union's socialist construction have promoted the great leap forward of the world. Now the Soviet Union has reached such strength, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved such a great victory, the construction of all people's democratic countries has achieved such great achievements, the anti-oppression and anti-aggression movement of the people of all countries in the world has risen to such a high level, and our friendship and solidarity front is so solid, so it can be completely asserted that we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. Any imperialist aggression will be smashed by us, and all despicable provocations are completely useless." Recent developments in the international situation have proven this assertion, and future facts will continue to prove it.

　　As we celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day today, just before the opening of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, representatives of trade unions from all over the world have come to our country to participate in the May Day conference and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. This fully demonstrates the close friendship between the working class and all the working people of our country and the working class and all peace-loving people of the whole world. We warmly welcome international friends and warmly congratulate the opening of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. We will raise the banner of patriotism and internationalism even higher, build our motherland more bravely and diligently, and fight more unitedly for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the peaceful resolution of all international disputes, and the realization of the people of the whole world's desire for peaceful coexistence among countries.

    更加勇敢而勤劳地建设我们的祖国
    ——庆祝“五一”国际劳动节和中国工会第七次全国代表大会
    在我们的国家开始了新的经济建设的伟大时期的头一年，我们来迎接“五一”国际劳动节，我们感觉到一个无比光荣的历史任务正落在我们的肩上。这就是要在我们这个小生产占绝对优势的农业国，逐步地实现国家的工业化。我国的新民主主义是走向社会主义化的过渡时期。逐步实现我国工业化的过程，就是对我国国民经济逐步地进行社会主义改造的过程。这个国家工业化的伟大历史任务，要求我们按照需要和可能的条件，充分地动员一切能够动员的力量，投到国家经济建设的战线上去。
    我们不能忘记，中国过去之所以会被帝国主义者肆意宰割，重要的原因之一就是中国没有工业，特别是没有重工业和国防工业的基础。毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”中根据一八四○年鸦片战争以来一百多年的历史，特别是国民党反动统治时期的历史经验，指出：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”因此，毛泽东同志当时就明确地规定了新中国的工业化和中国工人阶级的历史任务。毛泽东同志说：
    “在新民主主义的政治条件获得之后，中国人民及其
    政府必须采取切实的步骤，在若干年内逐步地建立重
    工业和轻工业，使中国由农业国变为工业国。新民主
    主义的国家，如无巩固的经济做它的基础，如无进步
    的比较现时发达得多的农业，如无大规模的在全国经
    济比重上占极大优势的工业以及与此相适应的交通、
    贸易、金融等事业做它的基础，是不能巩固的。
    ……中国工人阶级的任务，不但是为着建立新民主
    主义的国家而斗争，而且是为着中国的工业化和农业
    近代化而斗争。”
    今天，我国工人阶级和全国人民必须按照毛泽东同志的指示，把我们的国家以工业为中心的经济建设的伟大任务，英勇地担当起来。
    过去三年多我国的经济恢复工作，基本上已经完成。各种民主主义的社会改革工作，一般地也陆续结束了。土地改革在四亿左右人口的地区上彻底摧毁了封建的经济基础，解放了广大农民的生产力；国营的工厂、矿山、企业的民主改革的完成，使工人真正成为企业的主人，生产积极性和创造性迅速提高；镇压反革命运动基本上肃清了残余的反动势力；三反、五反运动在很大的范围内清除了旧社会遗留的污毒，击退了资产阶级不法分子的进攻，巩固了社会主义经济的领导地位。由于这些改革，特别是由于工人阶级的增产节约运动，我国的经济财政状况虽在进行抗美援朝斗争的情况下，却得到了比预期为早的根本好转。这些就使我国现在开始进行新的经济建设的条件大体具备了。
    这个新的经济建设必须以工业特别是重工业为中心，根据国内市场首先是农民市场的需要，根据我国资源的规模和技术的条件，也根据资金积累的速度，合理地有计划地进行基本建设，发展新的企业，改造原有的企业，并发展交通运输事业。我们要提高和改进农业生产，有步骤地发展农民的互助合作，改进和发展手工业生产；同时要发展国营商业和合作社的贸易，畅通城乡物资交流，并在发展生产的基础上改善工人及其他劳动人民的物质生活和文化生活。我们必须大量培养建设的人材，努力学习苏联先进的理论和科学技术，以建设我们的国家。在这个建设事业中起决定作用的是我国工人阶级的力量。只要我们工人阶级和全体劳动人民，更加紧密地在中国共产党的领导下团结起来，巩固工农联盟，巩固全国人民的团结，并在建设工作中起带头和模范的作用，热烈地开展劳动竞赛，保证完成和争取超额完成国家的经济建设计划，那末，我国的建设事业就一定能够成功。
    中国工人在中国共产党和工人阶级的群众组织中国工会的领导之下，在过去三年中已经证明自己是中国建设事业的伟大先锋。中国工会胜利地组织了工人群众的广泛的劳动竞赛，参加竞赛的职工已占职工总数百分之八十左右，在竞赛的职工中三年来涌现了劳动模范二十二万三千余名。我国的经济恢复正是这个热烈的劳动竞赛的结果。我国工人运动和工会工作目前的中心任务，就是继续深入展开健全的经常性的劳动竞赛，借以加强劳动纪律，推广合理化建议和先进经验，提高劳动生产率，发掘企业的潜在力量，达到增加产品数量、提高产品质量、降低生产成本、确保生产安全、完成和超额完成生产计划的目的。
    劳动竞赛是工人阶级发展自己的生产的基本方法。在一九三○年六月“联共（布）第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告和结论”中，斯大林同志指出：“竞赛的好处就是竞赛在人们对待劳动的观点上造成一种根本的转变，因为它使劳动从以前认为是卑鄙的繁重的重担变为荣耀、光荣、英勇和勇敢的事业。”苏联在社会主义和共产主义建设中的劳动竞赛，正是按照斯大林同志的指示而发展起来的。我们也应该按照斯大林同志的指示，学习苏联的经验，来组织和领导我们的劳动竞赛。
    要组织和领导劳动竞赛，必须先有生产计划。没有生产计划的竞赛必然是形式主义的。因此，所有的工厂、矿山、企业的工人、技术人员和职员都要积极参加讨论和制订生产计划。要根据计划的指标，研究提高现有设备的利用率、节省原材料、改善劳动组织、改进生产过程、改进生产工具的各种办法，有目的地提出合理化的建议，制订能够增加产量、提高质量、减低成本的先进的生产计划。每个车间、小组和个人要根据计划，提出保证完成和争取超额完成计划的竞赛条件；并且根据具体情况，由简而繁地订立集体合同和联系合同，使群众自觉地以集体劳动来完成生产计划。在这过程中，领导的首要任务就是要积极地去发现和支持一切先进的新事物，培养典型，总结和推广先进经验，及时地改善技术操作规程，通过实际经验，把落后的提高到先进的水平，使劳动竞赛不断地向前发展。
    这样广泛的群众性的劳动竞赛的开展，必须通过一定的组织形式，而最好的形式就是生产会议和集体合同。领导劳动竞赛的工作只有和工人群众的创造性活动相结合，和合理化建议相结合，和工人群众的切身利益相结合，才能收到最大的效果。
    保障职工群众的物质生活和文化生活，向职工群众进行共产主义教育，是工会工作的另外两项基本任务。这两项任务是服务于发展生产的，是发展生产所必需的。在职工福利问题上，必须坚决克服目前存在的忽视职工福利的官僚主义倾向，同时坚决克服不顾生产利益而片面地、过高地强调职工福利的经济主义倾向。必须继续不断地提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，教育工人群众成为为国家工业化和共产主义的伟大前途而努力奋斗的战士。
    我们伟大祖国的经济建设事业不仅是工人阶级的事业，而且也是全国人民的共同事业。让我们全国人民，不分工人、农民、牧民、渔民、盐民、船民、手工业者、贸易工作者、合作社工作者、国家机关和人民团体的工作人员、青年、学生、妇女、教育工作者、科学技术工作者、医药卫生工作者、文学艺术工作者、工商业者和店员，各民主党派、各团体、各民族、各阶层、各种宗教信仰的人们，都在伟大的爱国主义的旗帜下，为建设我们的国家而一致努力吧。还在一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议开幕的时候，毛泽东同志已经说过：“我们的民族将从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族的大家庭，以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时也促进世界的和平和自由。”现在，国家建设的事业已经摆到我们的面前了，我们就一定要更加勇敢而勤劳地去建设我们的祖国，去创造自己的文明和幸福，去促进世界的和平和自由。
    我们深切地了解，我们的事业是和世界和平民主社会主义的事业不可分的，是和世界一切爱好和平人民的事业息息相关的。我们所以能够如此迅速地恢复和发展我国的经济，除了我国工人阶级和全国人民勇敢而勤劳的努力之外，伟大的苏联给予我国的兄弟般的无私援助，是有决定意义的。苏联的援助对于我国今后的建设将有更重大的意义。马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议上的发言中说：“苏联政府今后将继续和伟大的中国人民，和各人民民主国家的人民在政治上和经济上密切合作，加强和他们的兄弟友谊与团结。”这种友谊和团结是牢不可破的，是我们的一切胜利的保证。正如毛泽东同志在“最伟大的友谊”中所说的：“三十年来，斯大林同志的学说和苏联社会主义建设的榜样，推动了世界的大踏步前进。现在苏联已达到这样的强大，中国人民革命已获得这样的伟大胜利，各人民民主国家的建设已有这样的巨大成就，世界各国人民的反压迫反侵略的运动已有这样的高涨，而我们的友谊和团结的阵线又是这样的巩固，所以，完全可以断言，对于任何帝国主义的侵略，我们都是不怕的。任何帝国主义的侵略都将被我们所粉碎，一切卑鄙的挑拨都是完全没有用的。”最近国际形势的发展已经证明了这个断言，今后的事实还将继续证明它。
    在我们庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的今天，正当我国工会第七次全国代表大会召开的前夕，世界各国工会的代表来到我国参加五一节大会和我国工会第七次全国代表大会。这充分地表现了我国工人阶级及一切劳动人民和全世界工人阶级及一切爱好和平人民的亲密友谊。我们热烈地欢迎国际友人，热烈地祝贺中国工会第七次全国代表大会的召开。我们将更高地举起爱国主义和国际主义的旗帜，更加勇敢而勤劳地建设我们的祖国，更加团结一致地为和平解决朝鲜问题、和平解决一切国际争端、实现全世界人民关于各国和平共处的愿望而奋斗。
