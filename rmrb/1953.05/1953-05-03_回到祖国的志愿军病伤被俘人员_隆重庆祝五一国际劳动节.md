    Volunteer Army Wounded, Sick, and Captured Personnel Returning to the Motherland Grandly Celebrate May Day International Labor Day
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army wounded, sick, and captured personnel who have returned to the embrace of the motherland grandly celebrated May Day International Labor Day on April 30th at their temporary hospital. This is the first time they have encountered their own holiday since returning to the embrace of the motherland.
    After two consecutive days of rain, April 30th dawned clear. All the returned comrades participated in the conference with excitement, and the seriously wounded and sick also arrived at the venue on stretchers or supported by nurses. After nearly ten days of preliminary treatment and comfortable recuperation, everyone was in high spirits. The staff of the temporary hospital decorated the venue for them. The clean road was covered with sand, surrounded by newly built flowerbeds, and the venue was surrounded by bright Chinese and Korean national flags.
    Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, participated in the conference. He explained the current international situation in detail to the returned comrades. He said: Today, comrades can return and freely celebrate their own holiday as a result of the world's people's struggle for peace; we will spare no effort to strive for the Korean armistice and world peace.
    Deputy Director Du Ping paid special attention to the health of each returned comrade. He repeatedly urged everyone to recuperate peacefully in the warm embrace of the motherland, recover their health as soon as possible, and serve the construction of the motherland.
    Li Gi-hyuk, Chairman of the Kaesong City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and Kim Seok-hoon, representative of the Korean People's Army, spoke at the meeting successively.
    Although the sallow complexions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army wounded, sick, and captured personnel who returned after suffering all kinds of torture in the US POW camps have not fully recovered, they felt infinitely gratified when they heard that the forces of peace and democracy have become increasingly strong in the past two years, their comrades-in-arms have become stronger and stronger in battle, and they can joyfully celebrate their own holiday with their comrades and the Korean people today. Wang Xiaoshan, the representative of the returned wounded, sick, and captured personnel, said at the meeting: They have returned to the embrace of the motherland and received cordial and good care, and they sincerely thank Chairman Mao Zedong, Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Chinese and Korean people, and the comrades-in-arms of the Chinese and Korean people's troops. On behalf of all the returned comrades, he guaranteed that they would never let down the wishes of the people of the motherland, and they must recuperate peacefully, recover their health as soon as possible, and work hard for the peaceful construction of the motherland.
    After the meeting, the acrobatics team of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Art Troupe performed wonderful programs for the returned comrades.

    回到祖国的志愿军病伤被俘人员
    隆重庆祝五一国际劳动节
    回到祖国怀抱的中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员，四月三十日在他们的临时医院里，隆重庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。这是他们回到祖国怀抱后第一次逢到的自己的节日。
    一连两天阴雨，四月三十日初晴。全体归来的同志满怀兴奋的心情参加了大会，重伤病员也坐着担架或由看护员们扶着赶到会场。经过近十天的初步治疗和舒适的休养，每个人精神都很饱满。临时医院的工作人员为他们布置好了会场。洁净的路上铺上沙土，周围有新设的花圃，会场四周飘荡着鲜艳的朝中两国国旗。
    中国人民志愿军政治部副主任杜平参加了大会。他对归来的同志们详细讲解了目前国际形势。他说：今天同志们得以归来，并能自由地庆祝自己的节日，是世界人民为和平斗争的结果；我们将不遗余力地为朝鲜停战与世界和平而努力。
    杜平副主任特别关心每个归来同志的身体健康。他一再叮嘱大家，在祖国温暖的怀抱里安心休养，早日恢复健康，为建设祖国服务。
    朝鲜劳动党开城市委员会委员长李基赫、朝鲜人民军代表金锡薰相继在会上讲了话。
    在美方战俘营中遭受百般折磨后归来的中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员的焦黄面色虽然还没完全恢复，但他们听到两年来和平民主力量日益强大，自己的战友愈战愈强，看到今天能与自己的同志和朝鲜人民在一起欢乐地庆祝自己的节日，感到无限欣慰。归来的病伤被俘人员代表王小山在会上说：他们重回祖国怀抱得到亲切的良好的照顾，衷心感谢毛泽东主席、金日成元帅、朝中人民和朝中人民部队的战友们。他代表全体归来的同志，保证决不辜负祖国人民的愿望，一定要安心休养，早日恢复健康，为祖国和平建设而努力。
    会后，中国人民志愿军文工团杂技队为归来的同志演出了精彩的节目。　（新华社）
