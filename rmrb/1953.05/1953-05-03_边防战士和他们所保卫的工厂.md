    Border Guards and the Factory They Defend
  　Jiang Qing
    The soldiers who defend the motherland day and night on the distant border are caring for the construction of the motherland with boundless enthusiasm. The representative meeting of the coastal defense and border defense forces of the Central and Southern Military Region and the Fourth Field Army has just ended, and the meritorious representatives of the Second Company of the Border Defense Force: Instructor Ma Zhenhua, Deputy Platoon Leader Han Junjie, and soldier Zou Changshou visited the Xicun Cement Factory in Guangdong with the infinite care of the border guards.
    The Second Company and this factory have a flesh-and-blood relationship. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Xicun Cement Factory suffered severe devastation. Not long after liberation, the Second Company took on the task of guarding the cement factory and actively participated in the restoration work. The factory gradually recovered, and when one of the deserted chimneys began to smoke, the Second Company accepted the task of defending the frontier, stationed on the border line to guard the thousands of factories of the motherland. But the soldiers have never forgotten this cement factory that they once guarded. As long as someone came from Guangzhou, they would inquire about the recovery and construction of the cement factory. Once, they were unloading cement when they suddenly discovered that the bags were all printed with the words "Product of Xicun Cement Factory". Everyone immediately shouted: Our own cement factory is sending cement to support us! So the soldiers worked extra hard to move the cement. Each bag of cement weighed fifty kilograms, and many soldiers carried two bags at a time. Han Junjie carried it back and forth five times. Several hundred bags of cement were transported in a short while, and even the bit that leaked on the truck bed was swept up by the soldiers.
    The restoration of the Xicun Cement Factory inspired the border guards to defend the motherland more vigilantly. One night, Zou Changshou was on sentry duty. The border line was as peaceful as usual. He suddenly heard a very light sound. He immediately thought of the cement factory. The instructor had said that no matter how big the rotary kiln was, a special agent could destroy it with a grenade. He observed vigilantly and saw two dark shadows in the ditch below. He rushed over immediately and grabbed one of them. The other tried to escape, but he caught up with him in one step and grabbed him as well. In this way, for more than two years, the Second Company has not allowed a single bad element to sneak in. Seventeen meritorious personnel, one model squad, and one model platoon have emerged from the entire company, and the company has also been commended by the military region.
    This time, when Ma Zhenhua and the others came to the meeting, the soldiers repeatedly told them: No matter what, we must go and see our factory.
    The workers of the cement factory also missed their protectors at all times. But they didn't know where they were, and several letters they wrote were sent to other troops. The workers were determined to use selfless labor to produce more cement to support the border guards. In the past three years, their output has exceeded three times the total output of the five years under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The output in the past year alone exceeded four and a half times that of 1949. In addition, they also created four national records: one for the lowest electricity consumption on the same mechanized basis, and three rotary kiln safe operation records. Especially the latter one, it was the height of summer in the South, and the lowest temperature in the rotary kiln was over a thousand degrees. The workers worked all day sweating, and the high temperature made their heads dizzy, but workshop director Sun Linye said: "Compared with the Volunteer Army and the border guards, what does this count for!" Sure enough, after the "August 1st" Army Day, they created a new national record, improving the first record by nearly double.
    The workers eagerly hoped to tell the Second Company about these achievements, but where were they? Just one afternoon not long before "May Day", it was still raining in the sky, and the three representatives of the Second Company arrived in Xicun.
    As soon as he got out of the car, Ma Zhenhua was attracted by a row of tall chimneys. When he left here, only one was smoking, but now all of them were spewing billowing smoke. Zou Changshou looked in surprise at the hillside where he used to cut grass, on which dozens of new workers' residences had been built; the place where he used to cut grass was now built into a flower garden, in full bloom with brightly colored flowers. Just as they were pleasantly surprised, several workers rushed over and shook their hands tightly.
    The wishes of both sides for more than two years have been realized. The workers warmly thanked them for their merits in defending the national defense. Labor union chairman Liang Su took Ma Zhenhua's hand and said, "Thanks to you for consolidating national defense!" The border guards thanked the workers for their support and talked about Zou Changshou's story. "Come and see! I'm afraid you won't recognize it!" The labor union chairman led the soldiers from the workshop to the cement mill, from the club to the clinic. Every familiar place had changed. Zou Changshou still remembered that stones used to be transported by handcart, and he often cut his hands on the edges of the stones there, but now roaring small trains were pulling the stones and running fast. The broken sentry post where Ma Zhenhua used to inspect the sentry every day has now become a beautiful white wooden house, with electric lights installed inside. Not only the factory has changed, but also the people have changed. Ma Zhenhua remembered that Sun Linye was a taciturn fitter, but now he is the highly respected director of the calcination workshop. Liang Su said: "Everything has changed. You are no longer ordinary soldiers, but meritorious people of the people; we are no longer ordinary workers, but factory cadres and labor models - this is our great motherland!"
    The unforgettable meeting added infinite strength to the workers who were working selflessly for the motherland and the border guards who were vigilantly guarding the frontier. The labor union chairman said: "This is just the beginning. I guarantee that we will produce more and better cement to support you in the future!" "You can completely trust it!" Ma Zhenhua replied, shaking his hand: "We will consolidate national defense into an impregnable wall!"

    边防战士和他们所保卫的工厂
  　江清
    在遥远的国境线上日日夜夜捍卫着祖国的战士，正以无限的热情关怀着祖国的建设。中南军区、第四野战军海防和边防部队代表会议刚结束，边防部队二连的功臣代表：指导员马振华、副排长韩俊杰、战士邹长寿就带着边防战士无限关怀的心情，访问了广东西村水泥厂。
    二连和这个工厂有着血肉相联的感情。西村水泥厂在国民党反动统治下，遭受了严重的摧残。解放后不久，二连就担负起警卫水泥厂的任务，并积极地参加恢复工作。工厂逐渐恢复起来，当冷清清的一排烟囱里，有一个烟囱开始冒烟的时候，二连接受了保卫边疆的任务，为警卫祖国千万个工厂而驻守到国境线上去了。但是战士们从来也没有忘记过自己曾经警卫过的这个水泥厂。只要有人从广州来，就要打听打听水泥厂恢复和建设的情况。有一次，他们正在卸水泥，忽然发现袋子上全都印着“西村水泥厂出品”的字样，大伙马上嚷开了：自己的水泥厂送水泥来支援我们了，于是战士们搬运的格外起劲了，一袋水泥五十公斤，有不少战士一次就背两袋，韩俊杰来回搬了五趟。几百袋水泥一会儿就运完了，连漏在车板上的一点儿，战士也把它扫起来了。
    西村水泥厂的恢复，鼓舞着边防战士更警惕地保卫祖国。一天夜里，邹长寿站哨。国境线上跟平时一样宁静。他突然听到一声很轻的响声。他马上想起水泥厂，指导员说过，别看旋窑多大，特务用一颗手榴弹就可以破坏它。他机警地一观察，在下面沟里有两个黑影，他马上冲过去，一把就抓住了一个，另一个想逃跑，他追上一步也给抓住了。就这样，两年多来，二连没有让一个坏分子钻进来。全连出现了十七个功臣、一个模范班、一个模范排，连队也受到军区的嘉奖。
    这次马振华他们来开会，战士们再三叮嘱：不管怎样也要去看看我们的工厂。
    水泥厂的工人也一样，时刻想念着自己的保卫者。但是不知道他们在哪里，写过几封信，都给寄到旁的部队里去了。工人们就决心用忘我的劳动，生产更多的水泥来支援边防战士。三年来，他们的产量超过国民党反动统治时期五年总产量的三倍。去年一年的产量就超过一九四九年的四倍半。此外还创造了四次全国纪录：一次在同一机械化基础上电耗量的最低纪录、三次旋窑安全运转纪录。特别是后一次，那时正是南方的盛夏，旋窑最低温度也在一千度以上。工人们整日流着汗工作，高温烤得头直发昏，但车间主任孙林业说：“跟志愿军、边防战士比起来，这算得什么！”果然在“八一”建军节后，他们又创造了新的全国纪录，比第一次的纪录提高将近一倍。
    工人们迫切地希望把这些成绩告诉二连，可是他们在哪里呢？就在“五一”节前不久的一个下午，天上还下着雨，二连的三个代表赶到了西村。
    一下汽车，马振华就被一排高大的烟囱吸引住了，他离开这里的时候，才只有一个冒烟，现在全都吐着滚滚的烟雾。邹长寿惊讶地看着他以前经常在那里割草的山坡，上面已盖起几十幢新的工人住宅；原先割草的地方，筑起了花圃，正盛开着鲜艳的花朵。正在惊喜的时候，几个工人冲过来，紧紧地握住他们的双手。
    双方两年多来的愿望实现了。工人们热烈地感谢他们保卫国防的功劳，工会主席梁苏拉着马振华的手说：“多亏你们巩固了国防！”边防战士感谢着工人们的支援，说起了邹长寿的故事。“快来看看吧！恐怕你们都不认得了！”工会主席领着战士们从车间到水泥磨，从俱乐部到医疗所。每个熟悉的地方都变了样。邹长寿还记得以前运石头是用手车推的，他在那里还给石块的棱角割破手，但现在轰隆隆的小火车拉着石头飞跑。马振华以前每天去查哨的破哨棚，现在变成了漂亮的白色木头房，里面还安了电灯。不但工厂变了，人也变了。马振华记得孙林业是个不爱说话的钳工，现在却是威信很高的锻烧车间主任了。梁苏说：“一切都变了，你们已经不是什么普通的战士，而是人民的功臣；我们也不是普通的工人，而是工厂干部和劳动模范——这就是我们伟大的祖国！”
    难忘的会见，给为祖国而忘我劳动的工人和警惕地守卫着边疆的国境哨兵增加了无限的力量。工会主席说：“这不过是开始，我保证今后生产更多更好的水泥支援你们！”“你完全可以信得着！”马振华握着他的手回答他：“我们会把国防巩固得像铜墙铁壁！”
