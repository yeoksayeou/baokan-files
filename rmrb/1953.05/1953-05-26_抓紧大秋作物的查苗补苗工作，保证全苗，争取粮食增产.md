    Seize the opportunity to check seedlings and replant autumn crops to ensure full stands and strive for increased grain production.
    Grain Production Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture
    During the spring planting season this year, many areas in the north experienced drought, and some autumn crops could not be sown as scheduled. In areas where planting had taken place, the emergence of seedlings was uneven due to insufficient rainfall. Recently, many areas have also suffered from hailstorms of varying degrees, causing partial damage to emerged seedlings. Based on past experience, some areas may continue to experience hailstorms in May and June. Underground pests have already emerged, with cutworms, mole crickets, and other pests widely harming crop seedlings. These situations pose a serious threat to ensuring full stands.
    Recently, widespread rainfall has occurred in various areas. Seizing this favorable condition to universally check seedlings and replant to ensure full stands has become a key aspect of the current agricultural season and a necessary measure for increasing grain production. As the saying goes, "Seeing seedlings is three-tenths of the harvest." Good seedlings are essential for a good harvest. In the past, insufficient seedlings were common in various areas, often affecting increases in grain yield. Cadres in Gaolou Village, Tong County, Hebei Province, once calculated the costs with the masses: If each mu (0.16 acres) is short 100 seedlings, the village's 1,700 mu of land will be short 170,000 seedlings. Based on 2,500 corn plants per mu, this is equivalent to planting 68 mu less. At a yield of 250 jin (125 kg) per mu, this results in a loss of 17,000 jin of grain. If each person consumes 45 jin of corn per month, the grain loss caused by the shortage of seedlings in one village is enough to feed 377 people for a month. This is a very serious loss.
    Ensuring full stands requires increasing the number of crop seedlings per mu appropriately based on local conditions and experience, within a certain row spacing, and maintaining a certain spacing between seedlings as much as possible to provide conditions for crops to achieve good and balanced development, thereby increasing yield per unit area. How can we ensure full stands? Our suggestions are:
    1. Check seedlings and replant in a timely manner to ensure no missing seedlings. Areas where seedlings have emerged unevenly due to drought-resistant planting or where seedlings are missing due to hailstorms or pests should mobilize the masses to check seedlings quickly. If missing seedlings are found, replanting should be carried out promptly. In the same piece of land, if some areas are short of seedlings and others have too many, the method of transplanting can be used for adjustment. The time for transplanting should be on cloudy days or in the evening to make it easier for seedlings to survive. The method of transplanting is to first dig pits in the areas with missing seedlings, then select strong seedlings from areas with many seedlings, water them thoroughly, and when the water has penetrated three or four inches deep and the soil is moderately moist, use a shovel to move the seedlings along with the soil into the dug pits, backfill the soil on all sides, and water immediately. When transplanting, avoid damaging the roots of the crops to avoid affecting future development. As the farmers say, "There's no trick to transplanting, don't let the seedling know," which is the key. In areas with severe underground pests, we should earnestly grasp the spirit of "early treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment." In areas where planting has not yet begun and conditions permit, toxic grains can be made using agents such as red arsenic, 666 powder, or sodium fluosilicate, or grass piles can be used to lure and kill pests. However, the methods of use should be well taught to cadres and the masses, and strict precautions should be taken to prevent poisoning of humans and animals. In areas where planting has already taken place, the masses should be organized to eliminate pests to ensure full stands.
    2. Thin seedlings and set seedlings at the appropriate time. To provide seedlings with an excellent environment, thinning and setting seedlings must be done at the appropriate time. After the seedlings emerge, thinning should be carried out as early as possible. On the premise of doing a good job in pest control and drought prevention to ensure no missing seedlings, seedlings can be set as early as possible to reduce the consumption of soil nutrients and allow the seedlings to be fully developed. Generally, crops such as sorghum, soybeans, and corn can be thinned when the seedlings are one or two inches tall and set when they are four or five inches tall (millet two or three inches). In areas where cultivation has been relatively extensive in the past, in order to rationally utilize land fertility and balance plant development, we can refer to the successful experience of Zhaoyuan County and adopt the method of leaving seedlings at equal distances during thinning, removing weak seedlings and selecting strong seedlings. In addition, according to local climatic conditions, soil fertility, and variety characteristics, combined with the experience of the masses, we should appropriately implement close planting and appropriately determine the spacing between seedlings and increase the number of plants planted per mu on the existing basis. Thinning, setting, and leaving seedlings is a complex, meticulous, but extremely important task, and the experience of farmers should be drawn upon to achieve good results.
    3. Pay attention to weeding to preserve moisture, resist drought, and protect seedlings. Weeding to preserve moisture after rain is an effective way to prevent drought. As the saying goes, "The hoe has water," which shows that weeding greatly helps the growth of crops. Especially in dryland areas, the soil hardens after rainfall, which requires more weeding to facilitate seedling emergence and crop growth and reduce the evaporation of moisture in the soil. In areas where rainfall is currently insufficient, we should seize the time to do a good job in drought resistance and seedling protection. In addition to areas with water conservancy conditions that can irrigate to protect seedlings, general areas can implement carrying water to irrigate and supply the seedlings with the water they need for growth.
    In order to ensure full stands, we should make full preparations in terms of ideology, materials, and technology for all possible natural disasters such as drought, flood, disease, and insects, and launch a resolute struggle at any time. At present, the drought situation in some areas has not yet been fundamentally resolved, and we must grasp the agricultural season and actively carry out drought-resistant planting, adopting methods such as planting on moisture-retaining soil, planting using residual moisture, and planting by watering, and complete the planting work in a timely manner.
    There are many ways to ensure full stands. Leading cadres should especially prevent mechanically applying experiences from other places or forcing farmers to do so. In order to do a good job in ensuring full stands, we should give full play to the wisdom of the local masses, promote the experience of the masses in protecting seedlings in light of local conditions, and lay a good foundation for future crop growth and development.

    抓紧大秋作物的查苗补苗工作，保证全苗，争取粮食增产
    中央农业部粮食生产司
    今春播种开始期间，北方不少地区呈现旱象，有些大秋作物未能如期播种。已播种的地区，由于雨水不很充分，作物出苗不够整齐。最近不少地区又遭受不同程度的雹灾，已出土的作物幼苗，受到部分伤害。依据过去经验，若干地区在五、六月间还有继续发生雹灾的可能。目前地下害虫已经发生，地蚕、蝼蛄等害虫普遍为害作物幼苗。这些情况对于保证全苗是一个严重的威胁。
    最近各地普遍降雨，抓紧这一有利条件，普遍进行查苗补苗、保证全苗工作，已成为当前农事季节中的主要环节，增产粮食的必要办法，俗语说：“见苗三分收”。有了好苗，才能有好的收成。过去各地缺苗的情况相当普遍，往往影响了粮食产量的增加。河北省通县高娄村干部曾和群众算过细账：如果每亩缺一百棵苗，全村一千七百亩土地，就会缺十七万棵苗，按玉米每亩二千五百棵计算，就等于少种六十八亩地，按每亩收二百五十斤，就少收粮食一万七千斤。如以每人每月食用玉米四十五斤计算，则一个村因缺苗所引起的粮食损失，足够三百七十七人吃一个月，这是十分严重的损失。
    保证全苗就是要求按照当地条件和经验，在一定的行距基础上，适当增加每亩作物的苗数，并尽量保持一定的苗距，给作物获得良好的均衡发育的条件，以提高单位面积产量。怎样才能保证全苗呢？我们的意见是：
    一、及时查苗补苗，保证不缺苗。凡因抗旱播种而出苗不整齐，或因受雹灾虫害而缺苗的地方，应发动群众赶快查苗。发现缺苗，就要及时补种。在同一块土地上，有的地方缺苗，有的地方苗多，就可用移栽办法进行调剂。移苗的时间宜在阴天或傍晚，使幼苗易于成活。移苗的方法是先在缺苗的地方挖坑，再在苗多的地方选择壮苗，充分浇水，俟水渗透三、四寸深，土壤干湿适度时，再用铁铲连土带苗移入挖好的坑里，四面壅土，即行浇水。移苗时不要损伤作物的根部，以免影响今后的发育。农民说：“移苗无啥巧，不叫苗知道”，就是这个道理。在地下害虫严重的地区，应该认真掌握“及早治、连续治、彻底治”的精神，在尚未播种而有条件的地区，可利用红砒、六六六粉或氟矽酸钠等药剂制成毒谷，或用堆草诱杀等办法进行防治。但应很好地将使用方法教给干部和群众，严防毒害人畜。在已播种的地区，要组织群众除治害虫，以确保全苗。
    二、适时间苗定苗。为使幼苗获得优良环境，必须适时间苗定苗。在幼苗出土后，应及早进行间苗。在作好除虫防旱工作，保证不缺苗的条件下，可及早定苗，以减少土壤养分的消耗，并使该留的苗得到充分发育的机会。一般高粱、大豆、玉米等作物，在苗高一、二寸时，便可开始间苗，四、五寸（谷子二、三寸）时即可定苗。在以往耕作较粗放的地区，为了合理利用地力，使植株发育均衡，可以参考肇源县的成功经验，在间苗时采用等距留苗的办法，除去细弱的苗，选留健壮的苗。此外，还应根据当地气候条件，土壤肥力和品种特性，结合群众经验，在现有基础上，适当地实行密植，适当地确定苗距及增加每亩种植的株数。间苗、定苗、留苗是一件复杂细致但十分重要的工作，应该吸取农民经验来进行，以便收到良好效果。
    三、注意锄地保墒，抗旱保苗，雨后锄地保墒，是预防干旱的有效办法，俗语说：“锄头有水”，这说明锄地对农作物的生长有很大帮助。特别在旱作地区，降雨后土壤板结，更需要锄地，以利幼苗出土和作物生长，并可减轻土壤中水分蒸发。在目前部分雨量不足的地区，应抓紧做好抗旱保苗的工作。除有水利条件的地区可进行灌水保苗外，一般地区可实行挑水运水点浇，供给幼苗生长所需的水分。
    为了保证全苗，对一切可能发生的旱、涝、病、虫等自然灾害，在思想上物质上和技术上都应做好充分准备，随时展开坚决的斗争。目前个别地区的旱象尚未基本解除，必须掌握农时，积极进行抗旱播种工作，采用接墒、借墒播种，坐水点种等办法，及时完成播种工作。
    保证全苗的办法是很多的，领导干部要特别防止机械搬用外地经验或强迫农民去做。为了做好保证全苗的工作，应该充分发挥当地群众智慧，因地制宜地推广群众中的保苗护苗经验，为今后作物生长发育打下良好基础。
