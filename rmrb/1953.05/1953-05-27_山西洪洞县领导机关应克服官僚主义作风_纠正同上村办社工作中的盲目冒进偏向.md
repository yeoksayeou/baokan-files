The leadership organs of Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, should overcome bureaucratic work styles and correct the blind and rash deviations in the work of the village-run cooperatives in Tongsang Village

Tongsang Village is a relatively affluent village in the Fourth District of Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, and its production level has greatly exceeded that before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The entire village has 143 households. In 1951, there was only one mutual aid group (consisting of four households). Last spring, under the leadership of party branch secretary Liu Changhua, this group developed into 24 households. Before the autumn harvest, the village developed four more large-scale mutual aid groups, with a total of 125 households participating. However, except for Liu Changhua's group, the other groups were all temporary.

Last August, the leadership of Hongtong County decided to pilot agricultural production cooperatives in Tongsang Village. At that time, only 35 households in the village were willing to join the cooperative. The county leadership organs transferred Liu Changhua to the special commissioner's office for training on the establishment of cooperatives, while also sending Wang Huali, the district chief of the Fourth District, to the village to assist in the establishment of the cooperative. After Wang Huali arrived in the village, he bluntly carried out propaganda about the new and old roads to the masses and threatened them, saying, "Whoever is unwilling to take the socialist road, we will march on him!" This caused ideological confusion among the masses.

After Liu Changhua returned to the village after seven days of training, he first discussed the matter of establishing the cooperative with Wang Huali. Wang said, "Small-scale efforts won't work, we must go big. If people are unwilling, forcibly pull them in and then consolidate them." Therefore, Wang called on Party and League members to take the lead in joining the cooperative at the Party branch meeting, and then universally mobilized the masses in the entire village to join the cooperative. When mobilizing the masses, they did not clearly explain the nature and policies of the cooperative, but only one-sidedly made the masses recognize the two roads of social development. At the mass meeting of the entire village, Wang Huali promoted "joining the cooperative early is advantageous," allowing the masses to sign up at the meeting. Many people, fearing being labeled as bourgeois, were forced to sign up. At one meeting, 62 households signed up. At this time, the village chief and several mutual aid group leaders had not yet signed up, so Wang Huali used individual mobilization and threats at the meeting to force these people to sign up. After the second mass meeting of the entire village, the number of registrations increased to 86 households. Veteran Cao Mumao, because he had a skill (weaving cloth) and was unwilling to join the cooperative, Wang ordered the village cadres to seal Cao's house. Cao Mumao was so frightened that he fled to Henan and hid for a long time before returning. As a result, some farmers, fearing isolation and attacks if they did not join the cooperative, also signed up. By last September, 114 households had signed up, accounting for 80 percent of the village's 143 households. Even nine traveling musicians who were always on the road joined the cooperative. After the registration ended, the assessment of land and property began. At this time, some farmers wanted to keep some good land for self-cultivation. Wang Huali said, "Other people's good land has already been entered, if you don't enter this piece of land, can you leave it empty when the tractor comes to plow the land later?" As a result, the land of more than ten cooperative members was entirely entered into the cooperative. When discussing the handling of livestock and vehicles, Wang blindly advocated the valuation of livestock and vehicles for entry into the cooperative. Some cooperative members were unwilling, so Wang threatened at the meeting, saying, "This is all because of bourgeois ideology." As a result, cooperative members did not dare to raise objections. Cooperative member Duan Ruyong was unwilling to have his livestock and vehicles enter the cooperative, so Wang Huali personally went to his home and said, "You are letting bourgeois ideology get the better of you!" Duan had no choice but to drag his livestock and vehicles to the street and say, "Value them as you see fit, anyway, District Chief Wang wants to communize when he establishes the cooperative, and next year I might starve to death!" This is how the Tongsang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was established.

Because this agricultural production cooperative was established under the coercion and threats of the cooperative establishment cadres, it caused great harm to the production and life of the masses from the very beginning. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects: 1. Because most of the cooperative members joined reluctantly, some people joined without obtaining the consent of their entire family beforehand. After these people joined the cooperative, family disputes often occurred, some even to the point of families being torn apart. Old man Duan Rutong joined the cooperative without discussing it with his son. His son quarreled and fought with him when he got back. The old man said angrily, "What's the point of living this way? Anyway, everything belongs to other people, what can I do!" After military family member Duan Hongyong signed up to join the cooperative, his father was afraid that he would not enjoy preferential treatment and disagreed. The two quarreled and finally, the father and son separated to settle the matter. 2. Because livestock and vehicles were entered into the cooperative too early, and investments were made blindly, the cooperative incurred huge debts, increased the burden on cooperative members, and affected the income of cooperative members. The cooperative's 70 head of livestock and 16 vehicles were valued at a total of 115.8 million yuan. After the livestock entered the cooperative, there was a shortage of fodder. The cooperative's cadres allocated fodder to cooperative members according to land area, with a fodder fee of 5,000 yuan per mu. Two collections were made last winter and this spring, with cooperative members bearing more than 40 million yuan. Old man Duan Rutong said, "I put my livestock and vehicles into the cooperative, but not only did I not get any money, but the cooperative indiscriminately chopped up my wheat stalks. Last year they asked me to pay 150,000 yuan, and this year they asked me to pay 500,000 yuan. It's really not worth it!" In order to stabilize the cooperative members' production enthusiasm, Wang Huali took out a large amount of loans for the cooperative and made blind investments, which further increased the burden on cooperative members. The 164.5 million yuan loan invested in wheat fields last year has not yet been repaid, and this spring another 140,000 catties of soybean cake were purchased on credit, amounting to 122.8 million yuan. Because the livestock were fed poorly and became thin, the cooperative took 23 weak livestock, plus five piculs of wheat, and borrowed 5 million yuan from the bank to exchange for five mules. As a result, after the autumn harvest this year, the interest on bank loans and production materials purchased on credit from the supply and marketing cooperative alone will require the payment of more than 200 piculs of wheat. The payment for the livestock valued for entry into the cooperative is stipulated to be paid off in two years, so another 50 to 60 million yuan will have to be paid. Cooperative members with empty pockets are very panicked, and some people say, "The means of production have all been entered into the cooperative. What if we can't get enough to eat relying on the cooperative?" 3. Because the cooperative's operations were large-scale and heavily indebted, some cooperative cadres wanted to make up for the losses by engaging in sideline occupations, which greatly affected agricultural production. Last winter, all the cooperative's livestock were driven out to engage in transportation. Although they earned more than 10 million yuan, it delayed the plowing of 460 mu of autumn land. The entire cooperative's more than 2,500 mu of land was not touched for renovation, and winter fertilizer accumulation work was not carried out. Cooperative members who did not participate in transportation work were idle at home all winter. Some cooperative members said: In previous years, the autumn land would have been plowed before winter, and everyone would have been busy accumulating fertilizer, but what has it become this year!

The leadership cadres of Hongtong County were aware of Wang Huali's bad style of commandism and the problems of Tongsang Village's cooperative. However, for a long time, they adopted a laissez-faire attitude. At the end of March this year, although the county leadership organs had sent cadres to Tongsang Village to carry out cooperative rectification work, the county leadership organs had not yet made specific instructions on how to deal with the problems of this cooperative. In the process of rectification, the cadres sent by the county still wanted to establish an agricultural production cooperative like Wang Jinyun's in Wuxiang County, regardless of the conditions. When the issue of whether the majority of cooperative members joined voluntarily had not yet been resolved, and even the work point calculation method of "dead division and live evaluation" had not yet been implemented in the cooperative (the cooperative implemented a work point calculation method of "regardless of male or female cooperative members, working one day is uniformly recorded as ten work points"), they were blindly promoting the experience of the "four fixes and contracting" system, attempting to consolidate the agricultural production cooperative with this method. This rectification method is obviously wrong. The leadership organs of Hongtong County should seriously address this issue and thoroughly correct the blind and rash deviations in the work of establishing the cooperative in Tongsang Village under the principle of not hindering spring plowing production.

    山西洪洞县领导机关应克服官僚主义作风
    纠正同上村办社工作中的盲目冒进偏向
    同上村是山西省洪洞县四区较富裕的村庄，生产水平已大大超过抗战前。全村一百四十三户；一九五一年只有一个互助组（共四户）。去年春季，在党支部书记刘长华的领导下，这个组发展为二十四户。秋收前，该村又发展了四个大型互助组，全村参加组的已有一百二十五户。但除刘长华组外，其他组都是临时组。
    去年八月，洪洞县领导方面确定在同上村试办农业生产合作社。当时全村只有三十五户愿意入社。县领导机关一面抽调刘长华到专署受关于建社的训练，一面派四区区长王怀礼去该村帮助建社。王怀礼到村后，就生硬地向群众进行新旧两条道路的宣传，并威胁群众说：“谁不愿意走社会主义，咱们就要向他进军！”造成了群众中的思想混乱。
    刘长华受训七天回村后，首先和王怀礼商量办社的事情。王说：“小干不行，要干就要大干；要有人不愿意，强拉进来再巩固他。”于是，王就在党支部大会上叫党、团员带头入社，接着在全村普遍发动群众入社。在发动群众时，不向群众讲清社的性质和办社政策，只是片面的让群众认清社会发展的两条道路。在全村群众大会上，王怀礼宣传“早入社早便宜”，让群众在会上报名参加。许多人因怕给戴上资产阶级的帽子，被迫报了名。一次会上就有六十二户报了名。这时，村长和几个互助组长还没有报名，王怀礼就用个别动员和大会威胁的办法，强迫这些人报名。在第二次全村群众大会后，报名的增加到八十六户。退伍军人曹木茂因有手艺
    （会织布）不愿入社，王便命令村干部封曹的家门，曹木茂吓的逃到河南躲了好久才回来。这样一来，有些农民怕不入社被孤立和遭受打击，也都报名入社了。到去年九月，报名的已有一百一十四户，占全村一百四十三户的百分之八十。有九户成天在外面跑的吹鼓手也入了社。报名结束后，接着进行土地评产。这时有些农民想留一点好地自耕。王怀礼说：“人家的好地都入了，你这块地不入，以后拖拉机来了，耕地时还能把你的空下不成？”结果，有十多户社员的土地全部入了社。在讨论处理牲口、车辆问题时，王又盲目提倡牲口车辆作价入社。有些社员不愿意，王就在会上威胁说：“这都是资本主义思想作怪。”结果社员有意见也不敢提。社员段如用不愿把牲口、车辆入社，王怀礼亲自找到他家里去说：“你是资产阶级思想作怪！”段只得把牲口和车拉到街上说：“作成啥算啥吧，反正王区长办社要共产哩，明年还能把我饿死了？”同上村农业生产合作社就是这样办起来了。
    这个农业生产合作社因为是在办社干部的强迫命令威胁下办起来的，一开始对群众的生产、生活就造成了极大的危害。这主要表现在这几方面：一、因为大部分社员都是勉强入社的，有些人事先没有取得全家同意就入了社。这些人入社后，家庭常闹纠纷，有的甚至闹得一家四分五裂，段如同老汉入社未和儿子商量，回去儿子和他争吵、打架，老汉气的说：“这光景过的还有啥意思啦，反正什么都是人家的了，我有啥办法！”军属段鸿用报名入社后，他父亲怕享受不到优待了，不同意，两人发生争吵，最后，父子二人分了家才算了事。二、因为过早地实行车马入社，又盲目进行投资，使社负债巨大，增加了社员负担，影响了社员收入。全社七十头牲口，十六辆车，共作价一亿一千五百多万元。牲口入社后，发生草料困难，社的干部按地亩向社员摊草料，每亩地草料费五千元。去冬今春征收两次，社员负担即达四千多万元。段如同老汉说：“我把牲口、车都入社了，不仅得不到钱，社里还不问青红皂白把我的麦秸铡了。去年让我出十五万元，今年又叫我拿五十万元，真不上算！”为了安定社员生产情绪，王怀礼替合作社领了大量贷款，盲目进行投资，又加重了社员的负担。去年麦田贷款投资一亿六千四百五十万元还未归还，今春又贷购了十四万斤豆饼，折款一亿二千二百八十万元。因为牲口喂瘦了，社内拿二十三头弱牲口，加上五石麦子，和银行贷款五百万元，换回五头骡子。这样一来，今年秋收以后仅银行贷款和供销社贷购生产资料的利息就须付出麦子二百多石。牲口作价入社的款规定是二年还清，那么，还要付出五、六千万元。家底空的社员心里很恐慌，有人说：“生产资料都入了社了，要靠社吃不上饭怎么办？”三、因为社的摊子大，负债多，有的社干部就想靠搞副业来捞本，结果农业生产大受影响。去年冬天，全社牲口都赶出去搞运输，虽然赚了一千多万元，但却耽误了四百六十亩秋地的翻耕工作。全社二千五百多亩地的修整工作没有动手，冬季积肥工作也没有进行。没有参加运输工作的社员在家闲了一冬天。有些社员说：要是在往常年，入冬以前秋地早刹过了，大家忙着积肥，今年成了啥样子！
    王怀礼的强迫命令的恶劣作风和同上村办合作社的问题，洪洞县领导干部是知道的。但他们在很长时间内采取了听之任之的态度。今年三月末，县领导机关虽已派干部到同上村进行整社工作，但这个社的问题究竟应如何处理，县领导机关仍未作出具体指示。在整顿过程中，县上派来的干部仍想不顾条件地办成一个武乡县王锦云式的农业生产合作社。在多数社员入社是否自愿的问题都还没有解决，社内连死分活评的记工办法都还没有实行（该社是实行
    “不论男女社员，干活一天一律记十分工”的记工办法）的时候，他们就在那里盲目推行“四定包工”制的经验，企图以此来巩固这个农业生产合作社，这样的整顿方法显然是错误的。洪洞县领导机关应当严肃对待这一问题，应在不妨碍春耕生产的原则下彻底纠正同上村办社工作当中的盲目冒进偏向。
