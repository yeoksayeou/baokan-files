Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 24th. The Harbin Railway Bureau and the Harbin Regional Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union recently signed a collective contract for 1953. This collective contract fully illustrates that in socialist state-owned enterprises, the interests of the state and the interests of the workers are completely consistent; the further improvement of the material and cultural life of the vast number of workers can only be realized on the basis of production development.

The annual production and financial plans formulated by the Harbin Railway Bureau this year are all higher than the actual figures completed last year. Taking the area under the former Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau as an example, this year's labor productivity will increase by 20.6 percent compared to the actual achievement last year, transportation costs will decrease by 5.4 percent, and operating profit will increase by 17.3 percent. Completing this plan is the primary task of Harbin railway workers.

Therefore, the 1953 collective contract of Harbin Railway first stipulates the guarantee of fulfilling and overfulfilling the transportation plan. Ensure that imported and exported goods, as well as the main materials needed for the national economy, are loaded at 100 percent; ensure that the dwell time of vehicles and goods operations is reduced by 0.1 hours compared to the plan, and the vehicle turnaround time is reduced by 0.2 hours compared to the plan; ensure that the daily vehicle kilometers of locomotives are increased by 5 kilometers compared to the plan; ensure that the cost of basic construction projects is reduced by 10 percent compared to the plan under the condition that the quality meets the regulations. In order to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the 1953 production and financial plan, the administration and the labor union have also specifically stipulated in the contract various technical and organizational measures in various departments, mainly to promote advanced experience and advanced working methods. On the basis of ensuring the completion of the transportation plan, the contract also made specific provisions for improving the material and cultural life of the workers. For example, ensuring that the scope of implementation of piece-rate wages is expanded from 92 percent of the number of employees who can be implemented throughout the railway in 1952 to 95 percent; ensuring that the labor protection and technical safety expenses allocated by the administration increase by 57 percent compared to 1952; ensuring that the administration allocates 19.6 billion yuan as expenses for building and repairing houses and dormitories, and allocates 21.1 billion yuan as expenses for major repairs of houses and apartments; ensuring the addition of 12 living supply stations and 7 canteens; ensuring the addition of outpatient clinics and the establishment of a medical responsibility system by district and section; ensuring the establishment of 104 cultural study classes and 300 spare-time schools throughout the railway without separating from production, so that 37,000 employees can receive cultural education, and ensuring that 28,000 illiterate people are eliminated by the end of the year. In order to meet the needs of railway business development, the 1953 collective contract also guarantees to train 2,845 new cadres using two methods: separating from production and not separating from production, improve the technical proficiency of 3,131 existing cadres and employees in technical schools, and enable 30,000 employees to regularly participate in technical studies in their units. In addition, there is also a special chapter in the contract stipulating the articles on abiding by national laws and labor discipline. The appendix to the contract also stipulates the methods for amending, supplementing, and inspecting the implementation of the contract.

The 1953 collective contract of Harbin Railway was signed based on the actual situation this year and with reference to the experience of the Chinese Changchun Railway learning from the Soviet Union in signing collective contracts in the past two years. In the process of drafting the contract, the administration and the labor union had carefully negotiated four times, so the content is relatively substantial. This is another major achievement of Harbin Railway in consolidating the experience of the former Chinese Changchun Railway in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union after compiling an advanced and reasonable 1953 production and financial plan.

    为保证完成一九五三年度生产财务计划
    哈尔滨铁路局和工会订集体合同
    【新华社哈尔滨二十四日电】哈尔滨铁路管理局和中国铁路工会哈尔滨区委员会在最近签订了一九五三年度的集体合同。这个集体合同充分说明：在社会主义性质的国营企业中，国家利益和职工利益是完全一致的；广大职工物质和文化生活的进一步改善，只有在生产发展的基础上才能实现。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局今年制订的全年生产财务计划都比去年实际完成数字提高。以原中国长春铁路局辖区为例，今年的劳动生产率要比去年实际达到的提高百分之二十点六，运输成本降低百分之五点四，运营利润提高百分之十七点三。完成这个计划是哈尔滨铁路职工的首要任务。
    因此哈尔滨铁路一九五三年度集体合同首先规定了保证完成和超额完成运输计划。保证进口和出口货物以及主要的国民经济所需物资做到百分之百的装车；保证车辆货物作业停留时间比计划缩减零点一小时，车辆中转时间比计划缩减零点二小时；保证机车日车公里比计划提高五公里；保证在质量合乎规定的条件下，使基本建设工程成本比计划减低百分之十。行政和工会为了保证完成和超额完成一九五三年度生产财务计划，在合同内还特别详细地规定了各部门以推广先进经验和先进工作方法为主的各项技术组织措施。在保证完成运输计划的基础上，合同在改善职工物质生活和文化生活方面，也作了具体的规定。如保证计件工资的实施范围由一九五二年度占全路能够实行的职工人数百分之九十二扩大到百分之九十五；保证由行政方面拨付的劳动保护和技术安全费用比一九五二年增加百分之五十七；保证由行政方面拨款一百九十六亿元作为新建和修复住宅、宿舍的费用，拨款二百一十一亿元作为住宅、公寓的大修费用；保证增设生活供应站十二处、食堂七处；保证增设出诊所，并建立分区分段的医疗负责制；保证在全路设立不脱离生产的文化学习班一百零四处、业余学校三百处，使三万七千个职工受到文化教育，并保证到年底扫除文盲两万八千人。为了适应铁路业务发展的需要，一九五三年度集体合同还保证用脱离生产和不脱离生产两种方法新培养干部二千八百四十五人，在技术学校提高三千一百三十一个原有干部和职工的技术熟练程度，并使三万职工经常参加本单位的技术学习。此外，合同内还特别有一章规定了遵守国家法令和劳动纪律的条文。在合同附则中还规定了关于合同的修正、增补以及执行情况的检查办法。
    哈尔滨铁路一九五三年度的集体合同，是根据今年实际情况并参照过去两年中国长春铁路学习苏联签订集体合同的经验而签订的。在合同的起草过程中，行政和工会曾慎重地协商过四次，因此内容比较充实。这是哈尔滨铁路在编制出先进合理的一九五三年度生产财务计划后，巩固原中国长春铁路学习苏联先进经验的又一个重大收获。
