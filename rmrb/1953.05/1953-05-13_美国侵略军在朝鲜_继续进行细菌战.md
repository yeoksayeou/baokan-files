    American Aggressor Troops in Korea
    Continue Germ Warfare
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th] According to a message from the Korean Central News Agency, Sariwon, 9th: American aggressor troops recently scattered a large number of germ-carrying insects over many rural areas in Hwanghae Province, Korea. On April 30th alone, enemy aircraft airdropped germ-carrying flies on areas of six counties including Anak, Sinwon, Hwangju, Ongjin, Kimchon, and Tosan. These airdropped flies were 0.7 cm long, with short, dark brown wings, and their shape was significantly different from the common flies in the local area. The enemy aircraft dropped the germ-carrying flies on Anak County at 11:00 a.m. on that day, and local residents witnessed this act of brutality.
    Prior to this, on April 26th, enemy aircraft frantically bombed the Jaeryong County area, followed by dropping germ-carrying insects such as flies and spiders.
    In order to cope with the germ warfare being continuously waged by the enemy, the Hwanghae Province Epidemic Prevention Committee has promptly dispatched mobile epidemic prevention teams to the scene to carry out emergency epidemic prevention work and assist the local people in further launching mass epidemic prevention struggles to eliminate various germ-carrying insects dropped by the enemy.

    美国侵略军在朝鲜
    继续进行细菌战
    【新华社平壤十一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社沙里院九日消息：美国侵略军最近对朝鲜黄海道许多农村地带大量撒布带菌虫子。在四月三十日那一天，敌机就对安岳、新院、黄州、雍津、金川、兔山等六个郡地区空投了带菌的苍蝇。这些空投的苍蝇身长零·七公分，翅膀短，黑褐色，其形状和当地常见的苍蝇有显著的差别。敌机对安岳郡投下带菌苍蝇是在当天上午十一时，当地居民亲眼看到了敌人的这一暴行。
    在此以前，敌机在四月二十六日曾疯狂轰炸载宁郡地区，接着就投下了苍蝇和蜘蛛等带菌虫子。
    黄海道防疫委员会为了对付敌人继续进行着的细菌战，已及时派遣机动防疫队到现场进行紧急的防疫工作，并协助当地人民进一步展开群众性的防疫斗争，扑灭敌人投下的各种带菌虫子。
