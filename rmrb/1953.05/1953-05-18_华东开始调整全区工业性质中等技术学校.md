East China has begun adjusting industrial technical schools throughout the region to more effectively train mid-level technical personnel for economic construction. The main objectives of this adjustment are to strengthen the planning of work, overcome blindness, and centralize unified leadership; to clarify the training goals of industrial technical schools and set up specialties; and to develop in a planned and focused manner on the basis of adjustment and rectification. After the adjustment, most of the industrial technical schools led by local authorities will be centrally and uniformly led by relevant central ministries. The East China Industrial Technical School Adjustment Working Committee is drawing on the experience of the college and department adjustments last year, and is repeatedly discussing specific methods for personnel allocation, experimental equipment, and book and magazine allocation with relevant business departments, striving to complete all adjustment work before the summer vacation.

East China currently has thirty-seven industrial technical schools with more than 34,000 students. The composition of students in industrial technical schools has changed greatly: in the early days of liberation, students from worker and peasant backgrounds accounted for only 10%, but now they account for 50%. After the adjustment, there will be forty-eight industrial technical schools, of which thirty-eight will be directly led by relevant central ministries. In order to meet the needs of national basic construction, great efforts will be made to rectify civil engineering and construction schools, and new Shanghai Construction Engineering School, Shanghai Civil Engineering School, and Suzhou Construction Engineering School will be built.

    华东开始调整全区工业性质中等技术学校
    华东区已开始进行全区工业性质中等技术学校的调整工作，以便更有效地培养中级经济建设技术人才。这次调整工作，主要是为了加强工作的计划性，克服盲目性，集中统一领导关系；明确工业性质中等技术学校的培养目标，并设置专业；在调整整顿的基础上，再有计划有重点地发展。调整后，大部分由地方领导的工业性质中等技术学校将由中央有关业务部门集中统一领导。华东区工业性质中等技术学校调整工作委员会，正一面吸取去年高等学校院系调整的经验，一面和有关业务部门反复商讨调整工作中的人事调配、实验器材和图书杂志等调拨的具体办法，争取暑假前全部完成调整工作。
    华东区现有工业性质中等技术学校三十七所，学生三万四千多人。工业性质中等技术学校学生成份已有很大变化：解放初期工农成份的学生只占百分之十，现在已达百分之五十。调整后工业性质中等技术学校将有四十八所，其中三十八所由中央有关业务部门直接领导。为了适应国家基本建设的需要，在这些学校中将大力整顿土木建筑工程学校，并新建上海建筑工程学校、上海市土木工程学校和苏州建筑工程学校等。（据新华社讯）
