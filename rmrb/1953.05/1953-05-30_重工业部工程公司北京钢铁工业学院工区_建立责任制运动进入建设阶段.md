Heavy Industry Department Engineering Company Beijing Steel Industry College Construction Area
    Establishing Responsibility System Movement Enters Construction Phase

    [Reported by this newspaper] The anti-waste and responsibility system establishment movement in the Beijing Steel Industry College construction area of the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry has begun to transition into the construction phase. Currently, several major responsibility systems have been submitted to the masses for discussion, and the construction responsibility system has been the focus of implementation. In transitioning to the construction phase, the construction area has gained the following insights:

    I. The construction phase is not merely a phase of business construction but also a phase of ideological construction; therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership. At the beginning of the construction phase in the construction area, there were various ideological obstacles. Some units only cared about their own convenience, regardless of whether it was feasible for others. For example, the initial draft of the technical supply system stipulated that "the construction site must submit a budget 20 days before requisitioning materials, otherwise materials will not be issued." However, in reality, it is impossible to submit a budget so early when the blueprints cannot reach the construction site on time. Some units did not diligently study and analyze the problems that were exposed, and did not learn from advanced experiences in light of the specific situation. Instead, they copied the company's responsibility system without thinking, changing the word "section" to "unit," and treated it as their own responsibility system. Still others took this opportunity to shirk responsibility, establishing a responsibility system with an irresponsible attitude. The construction area promptly criticized these erroneous ideas and practices, while also commending some cadres who were conscientious and responsible in the process of building the system, calling on everyone to learn from them. In addition, some forums for technicians and staff should be held regularly to listen to their opinions, solve their ideological problems, and encourage them to actively carry out the construction of the responsibility system.

    II. When each unit formulates various systems separately, it is inevitable that the systems of related units will not be connected or closely coordinated. To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to strengthen the links between superiors and subordinates, and between left and right, to ensure that the various systems are formulated more realistically. Therefore, the construction area convened five professional meetings according to the nature of the business, including: a professional meeting focusing on the dispatch room to study technical organizational measures and work plans; a professional meeting focusing on the labor organization unit to study the organization and allocation of labor resources, calculation and distribution of wages, etc.; a professional meeting focusing on the supply unit to study supply issues, etc. Through this series of professional meetings, on the one hand, the phenomenon of mutual buck-passing and no-one caring was eliminated. At the same time, the ideas of departmentalism, waiting and shirking responsibility to varying degrees were criticized through discussion. After the meeting, each unit combined the problems exposed by its own unit and those transferred from other units to check the drafted plan item by item, find contradictions, and solve problems. They also took the initiative to adopt the method of "visiting door-to-door" to strengthen contact. For example, comrades from the material supply unit went to the dispatch room and realized that the budget date they had stipulated was not practical. After consultation, they made realistic revisions, which satisfied both parties. This clarified the scope of business and mutual relations, and reversed the situation of mutual inactivity and lack of coordination, creating conditions for the future implementation of the responsibility system.

    III. In the process of establishing the responsibility system, the construction area continuously enriched and revised various systems through practice. On May 20, an inspection team of 29 people was organized to inspect the implementation of the operation plan and the economic accounting of the teams in the second construction site. It was found that the operation plan was too complicated, and the situation on the construction site changed greatly, which might lead to frequent revisions of the operation plan, and the leaders of the construction site were in a passive position. Therefore, the operation plan was revised in a timely manner. At the same time, it was also found that it was unreasonable for the material clerk to calculate the fixed-quota material requisition slips in the team economic accounting manual at the end of the month, so the cost clerk was changed to share the settlement. Through preliminary practice, it was tested whether these responsibility systems were practical, and necessary revisions were made to those that were not practical, so that the various responsibility systems were more reasonable and feasible. In this way, construction, practice and revision were carried out simultaneously, closely integrating the movement with the current work, which better promoted the current work.

### 重工业部工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区  建立责任制运动进入建设阶段

    建立责任制运动进入建设阶段
    【本报讯】中央重工业部直属建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区的反浪费与建立责任制运动已开始转入建设阶段。目前几项主要的责任制已交与群众讨论，并重点推行了施工责任制。在转入建设阶段中，该工区已有如下的几点体会：
    一、建设阶段不单纯是业务建设的阶段，而且也是思想建设的阶段，因此必需加强思想领导。该工区建设阶段开始时，存在着各式各样的思想障碍。有的单位只管自己方便，不管人家是否行得通。如技术供应制度的初稿中规定：“工地领用材料一律在二十天前提出预算，否则不予发料。”而实际上在目前图纸不能按时到达工地的情况下，是不可能这样早提出预算的。如有的不去认真研究分析揭发出来的问题，结合具体情况学习先进经验，而是不动脑筋，把公司的责任制度照抄一遍，将“科”字改为“股”字，就把它当作自己的责任制度。更有的借此机会将责任能推就推，以不负责任的态度来建立责任制。该工区及时地批判了这些错误的思想和作法，同时又表扬了一些在建设制度过程中认真负责、态度正确的干部，号召大家向他们学习。此外应经常召开一些技术人员和职员座谈会，倾听他们的意见，解决他们的思想问题，鼓励他们更加积极地进行责任制的建设工作。
    二、在各单位分别拟定各种制度时，不可避免地会使有关单位的制度发生不相衔接、不紧密配合的现象，为了解决这一矛盾，就必须加强上下左右的联系，以保证各种制度拟订得更切合实际。因此该工区即按照业务性质的区分，召开了五个专业会议，包括：以调度室为主，研究有关技术组织措施及作业计划的专业会议；以劳动组织股为主，研究有关劳动力组织调配、工资计算发放等的专业会议；以供应股为主，研究供应问题的专业会议等。通过这一系列的专业会议，一方面消除了互相扯皮及三不管现象，同时通过讨论也批判了不同程度的本位主义、等待推诿的思想。会后各单位并将拟订好了的草案，结合本单位揭发的和其它单位转来的问题，逐条加以核对，发现矛盾，解决问题。并主动采取“登门拜访”的办法，加强联系。例如材料供应股的同志到调度室，发觉到自己规定的预算日期不切实际，经过协商后，进行了切合实际的修改，双方都很满意。这样明确规定了业务范围及相互关系，并扭转了互相不主动不协调的局面，为今后贯彻执行责任制创造了条件。
    三、在责任制建设过程中，该工区通过实践不断地充实与修正各种制度。五月二十日组织了二十九人的检查组，检查了第二工地贯彻作业计划和小组经济核算的情况，发现了作业计划过于复杂，而工地情况变化又大，这样可能使作业计划常常修改，工地的领导陷于被动，因此就及时修正了作业计划。同时又发现小组经济核算手册中的定额领料摺由材料员在月底核算也不合理，因此就改由成本员分担结算。通过初步实践也就考验了这些责任制是否切合实际，并对不切合实际的加以必要的修正，使各种责任制更加合理，做到切实可行。这样一面建设一面实践修正，使运动和当前工作密切结合起来，也就更好地推动了当前工作。
