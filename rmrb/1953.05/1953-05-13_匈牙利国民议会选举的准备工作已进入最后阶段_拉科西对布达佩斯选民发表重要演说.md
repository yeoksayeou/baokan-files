Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: Preparations for the Hungarian People's Republic National Assembly elections have entered the final stage, according to TASS. As early as the beginning of April, a vigorous political campaign to nominate candidates for deputies was launched throughout the country. By the end of April, the nomination of candidates had been successfully completed. Leaders of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the government, as well as many advanced working people, were nominated as candidates for deputies. Currently, meetings between candidates and voters are being held across the country. Candidates have delivered speeches at these meetings, recounting the glorious achievements of the Hungarian people in various fields, which have been warmly welcomed by voters.

The first candidate nationwide – First Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mátyás Rákosi, met with 200,000 voters in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, on the 9th. At the meeting with voters, he delivered an important speech, reporting on the faithful implementation of the previous election program by the Hungarian People's Independence Front, led by the Working People's Party, over the past four years. He particularly emphasized the tremendous achievements made in the first three years of the first Five-Year Plan (1950-1954). Rákosi pointed out that in the past three years, the actual allocation for developing the national economy in Hungary reached 40 billion forints (Hungarian currency), exceeding the total investment in the national economy stipulated for the five-year plan. Hungary has become an industrial nation with a developed agriculture. By the end of last year, the production volume of manufacturing industry had increased to three times that of the year before World War II. The ranks of the working class have grown stronger and played a huge role in production. More and more peasants have embarked on the path of large-scale socialist agricultural management. Now, production cooperatives and state farms together own 40 percent of all cultivated land. Rákosi then briefly described the content of the second Five-Year Plan, which the National Assembly will discuss and adopt after the election. This plan stipulates that from 1955 to 1959, the output of coal, iron, steel, and electricity will double compared to the first Five-Year Plan, agriculture will be further developed, and the material and cultural lives of the people will be further improved. Rákosi finally called on the Hungarian working people to work harder to fulfill their work responsibilities and strive for peace.

Rákosi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by storms of applause and cheers. The voters present constantly shouted, "We vote for the Hungarian People's Independence Front!" "We demand peace!"

    匈牙利国民议会选举的准备工作已进入最后阶段
    拉科西对布达佩斯选民发表重要演说
     【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民共和国国民议会选举的准备工作已进入最后阶段。早在四月上旬，全国各地热烈地展开了推举议员候选人的政治活动。到四月下旬，候选人的提名工作已胜利完成。匈牙利劳动人民党和政府的领袖们，以及许多先进的劳动人民都被提名为议员候选人。现在，全国各地纷纷举行候选人和选民会见的集会。候选人在集会上发表了演说，叙述匈牙利人民在各方面的辉煌成就，受到选民们的热烈欢迎。
    匈牙利全国第一名候选人——匈牙利劳动人民党总书记、部长会议主席马·拉科西九日在匈牙利首都布达佩斯和二十万选民会见。他在会见选民的集会上，发表了重要的演说，报告以劳动人民党为首的匈牙利人民独立阵线四年来忠实执行上届选举纲领的情况。他特别着重地叙述了第一个五年计划
    （一九五○—一九五四年）头三年中所取得的巨大成就。拉科西指出，在过去三年中，匈牙利发展国民经济的实际拨款达四百亿福林（匈币名），超过了五年计划所规定的五年国民经济的投资总额。匈牙利已经变成了一个有发达的农业的工业国家。到去年年底，制成品工业的生产量已增加为第二次世界大战前一年的三倍。工人阶级的队伍已经壮大起来，在生产中发挥了巨大的作用。越来越多的农民走上了进行大规模社会主义农业经营的道路。现在，生产合作社和国营农场共拥有全部耕地的百分之四十。拉科西接着扼要地叙述了当选后的国民议会将要讨论通过的第二个五年计划的内容。这个计划规定，从一九五五年到一九五九年，煤、铁、钢和电力的产量将比第一个五年计划增加一倍，农业将获得进一步发展，人民的物质和文化生活将有进一步的提高。拉科西最后号召匈牙利劳动人民更加努力履行自己的工作职责，为争取和平而努力奋斗。
    拉科西的演说一再为暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声所打断。到会的选民不断地高呼“我们投匈牙利人民独立阵线的票！”“我们要求和平！”。
