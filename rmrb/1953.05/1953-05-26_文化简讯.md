Zhang Junde Improves the "Earth-Moon Orrery" After Studying
    Zhang Junde, the creator of the "Earth-Moon Orrery," has gained richer scientific knowledge after a year of study at the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing. Recently, he and the technicians and workers of the Nanjing Scientific Instrument Manufacturing Factory, which produces the "Earth-Moon Orrery," jointly studied and improved the "Earth-Moon Orrery." The new "Earth-Moon Orrery" improves the electrical device, reduces the voltage, and can be equipped with dry batteries, making it usable in cities with electric lights and villages without electric lights. This improvement reduces the cost by nearly half. In order to further popularize the "Earth-Moon Orrery," under the guidance of experts, Zhang Junde has recently designed a "Popular Earth-Moon Orrery." The "Popular Earth-Moon Orrery" maintains the main functions and advantages of the original "Earth-Moon Orrery," but the cost is only about one-twentieth of the cost of the "Earth-Moon Orrery" currently produced by the factory, and ordinary people can manufacture it by referring to the drawings.
    Zhang Junde is a teacher at the Xi'an Normal School Affiliated Primary School in Shaanxi Province. With the help of the People's Government, he made the "Earth-Moon Orrery" in 1951 and was transferred to the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government in May 1952 for advanced studies.

China Youth Art Theater Performs the Play "Forty Years of Aspiration"
    The China Youth Art Theater will perform the three-act, six-scene play "Forty Years of Aspiration" at the Beijing Youth Palace Theater starting on May 25. The authors are Li Qingsheng, Zhao Qiang, Tian Guangcai, Shi Man, and Shi Xi, and it is directed by the famous playwright Hong Shen.
    This play takes the great construction of the motherland—the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway—as its theme, depicting how workers in a steel factory, in order to supply steel rails for the entire line, demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and a master's attitude towards labor in production, carried out sharp ideological and political struggles, overcame various difficulties, and finally ensured the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of the Southwest had longed for for forty years.

    张俊德经过学习后改进了“月地运行仪”
    “月地运行仪”的创造者张俊德在南京紫金山天文台经过一年的学习，获得了较丰富的科学知识。最近他和生产“月地运行仪”的南京科学仪器制造厂的技术人员、工人共同研究改进了“月地运行仪”。新的“月地运行仪”改进用电装置，降低电压，并可装置干电池，在有电灯的城市和没有电灯的乡村都可使用。这个改进降低了将近一半成本。为了进一步普及“月地运行仪”，在专家指导下，张俊德最近又设计了一种“普及式月地运行仪”。“普及式月地运行仪”保持了原来“月地运行仪”的主要效能和优点，但成本只有现在工厂生产的“月地运行仪”的成本的二十分之一左右，一般人参照图样就可以进行制造。
    张俊德是陕西省西安师范附属小学的教师，在人民政府帮助下，一九五一年制成“月地运行仪”，一九五二年五月由中央人民政府教育部调到南京紫金山天文台深造。
