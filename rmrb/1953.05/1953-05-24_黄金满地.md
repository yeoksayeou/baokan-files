    Gold Everywhere
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    On the construction site of the Tiexi Workers' Village in Shenyang, the spring wind constantly swirls yellow sand and white ash from the ground, scattering them in the air. The white mortar at the base of the walls, originally more than a foot thick, has now been flattened by footsteps, leaving only pale traces. Much of the yellow sand has hardened into clumps of earth, and people walking over it leave many footprints. On a small hill-like pile of yellow sand, children laugh and huddle together, patting the sand and placing pieces of broken brick on top, trying to build a wall on this "little desert." I wondered why there was so much white ash and yellow sand on this construction site. A young worker walked up to me. I asked him, "Where did all this yellow sand and white ash come from?" He frowned and said angrily, "It's all left over from last year when this workers' village was built!" "Can it still be used?" "No way! It's all been blown away and deteriorated!"
    Some might think, "Yellow sand and white ash, what's so precious about them?" But, please, let's do the math: Last year, the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry used 97,000 cubic meters of yellow sand. The price of each cubic meter of yellow sand, including transportation costs, was 70,000 yuan. According to the company's lowest estimate, the 2% of yellow sand lost last year equates to a loss of over 130 million yuan. Last year, this engineering company used 12,000 tons of white ash, and at least 520 tons were lost. Each ton of white ash is worth 200,000 yuan, which means that over 100 million yuan worth of white ash was wasted last year. This is no small figure!
    Near the Tiexi Workers' Village, several small houses are scattered randomly. These small houses were built by nearby residents who scavenged materials; the workers here told me, "Most of the bricks and wood in these houses are from our public property." Last year, the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the First Engineering Company of the Electrical Industry Administration Bureau, and the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration Bureau, which were building houses in this area, used a lot of red bricks. During transportation, no one was responsible, and red bricks often fell to the ground. The lost red bricks gradually sank into the ground, deeper and deeper, some as deep as two feet, and no one cared. The nearby residents, day and night, freely came here to pick up bricks, and no one stopped them. Even now, many red bricks are scattered on the roads, in the ditches, and in the fields. On a wide dirt road, I saw dozens of workers building the road, turning over the soil, and buried in the soil were red bricks more than a foot thick. I walked through the workers' village and found broken bricks and stones left around almost every house. Most of these bricks had sunk into the ground, level with the ground, with only a slight red color showing.
    As I was about to leave the Tiexi Workers' Village, I suddenly saw an old man wearing a black padded jacket, carrying a piece of wood more than three meters long, walking towards the outside of the construction site. A worker ran up and stopped him: "Why are you taking our wood?" The old man calmly replied:
    "Many people took it in the past, and you didn't care. Why do you care now?" He reluctantly put down the wood and walked away. Last year, when the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry built the workers' village, some wood was lost. The workers were very unhappy and said, "When we make doors and windows, we can't bear to lose even a small piece of wood. We finally put the remaining wood together and handed it in, but because no one was responsible for safekeeping, the wood disappeared." This year, the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry handed over more than 500 cubic meters of wood accumulated from last year to the Tiexi Winter Training Class for safekeeping. The Winter Training Class casually left the wood in the open air. Nearby residents often came to take the wood to build their own houses. Workers' families also came here to take wood to burn as firewood. People in the kitchens and boiler rooms used the wood as the best fuel for cooking and boiling water. Now, of the more than 500 cubic meters of wood, only more than 200 cubic meters are left. Who is responsible for the waste of more than 300 cubic meters of wood? Who should compensate for it? No one knows. Yang Lianzhong, the captain of the carpentry team, told me that they had told the two directors of the Winter Training Class, asking them to take good care of the wood. After hearing this, the two directors nodded and then ignored it. They watched the wood being wasted and didn't care, actually thinking, "Anyway, it's being used for the welfare of the employees."
    Cui Shangren, the Chief of the Materials Section of the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, said: "On every construction site, you can see many cement bags thrown on the ground. Some workers tear open the bags and wrap them around themselves. Some workers pick up a pickaxe and smash open the cement bags, pouring out the cement. But, no one has thought about it: these bags can still be used, they can still be sold for money." Last year, a used cement bag could be sold for at least 3,000 yuan. One ton of cement has twenty bags. Last year, the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry used a total of more than 28,000 tons of cement, which means that 580,000 cement bags disappeared. If these 500,000 cement bags had not been damaged, they could have been sold for at least 1.7 billion yuan. But who ever paid attention? The bags worth more than 1.7 billion yuan are all buried in the soil.
    The reason for these phenomena is that on the construction site, there is no one specifically responsible for transporting materials; there is no fixed system for sending materials; no one cares whether materials are returned or not; no attention is paid to saving materials; materials are thrown everywhere after use; no one asks about lost materials. The workers said: "On our construction site, there is gold everywhere!" Indeed! On many construction sites, you can see a lot of discarded yellow sand, red bricks, stones, cement, wood, iron pipes, and steel bars. In some people's eyes, these valuable materials are not money, not the blood and sweat of the working people. When someone sees a Renminbi note thrown on the ground, they will immediately pick it up and exclaim, "This is money! Why is it thrown on the ground, and no one cares?" But some people see materials worth tens of millions of Renminbi thrown on the ground and are indifferent, not paying attention. What is the reason for this? Because they think "wasting some materials doesn't matter." But they don't think about it: how much Renminbi are the wasted materials worth! Wasting one cubic meter of stones is 120,000 yuan; wasting one cubic meter of yellow sand is 70,000 yuan; wasting a handful of cement is several thousand yuan. According to preliminary statistics, last year the Materials Section of the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry wasted 6 billion yuan in vain simply on the procurement, transportation, and storage of some major materials. From this, it can be seen that wasting some materials is not "doesn't matter," but a great harm to national construction. Sand, gravel, red bricks, cement, wood, and steel bars, these materials necessary for the construction of the motherland, are so scarce today! Without red bricks, without cement, without wood, without steel bars, without sand and gravel, where can we build tall factories, magnificent buildings, and beautiful schools? Wasting these materials is equivalent to delaying the speed of national construction, which is equivalent to hindering the arrival of national industrialization. Isn't this a very clear principle?

    黄金满地
    本报记者  陈迹
    在沈阳铁西工人村的工地上，春风不断地卷起地上的黄砂和白灰，在空中飞荡。墙脚下的白灰浆，本来有一尺多厚，现在已被人踩平，只留下斑白的痕迹。许多黄砂已结成土块，人们从上面走过，留下许多脚印。在一座小丘陵似的黄色的砂土堆上，孩子们嘻笑地挤在一起，拍着砂土，把一块块碎砖放在上面，想要在这“小沙漠”上砌一座围墙，我奇怪这个工地上怎么会有这么多白灰和黄砂。一个年轻的工友向我走来。我问他：“这些黄砂和白灰，是哪里来的呀？”他皱起眉头，气冲冲地说道：“还不是去年修建这个工人村时留下来的！”“还能用么？”“不行了！都吹散了，变了质啦！”
    有人或许以为：“黄砂，白灰，这有什么可珍贵的呢？”但是，请你算算罢：去年重工业部建设工程公司用了九万七千立方公尺的黄砂。每立方公尺黄砂的价格连运费在内是七万元。根据该公司最低的估计：去年损失了百分之二的黄砂，就等于损失了一亿三千多万元。去年这个工程公司用了一万二千吨白灰，至少损失了五百二十吨。每吨白灰价值二十万元，合计起来，去年浪费的白灰就有一亿数百万元。这是一笔不小的数字呵！
    在铁西工人村附近，零乱地排着几栋小房子。这些小房子，是附近居民检来的；这里的工友告诉我：“这些房子的砖头和木料，大多是咱们公家的。”去年在这块地方修建房屋的重工业部建设工程公司，电器工业管理局第一工程公司和有色金属管理局第二工程公司，用了很多红砖。在运送的时候，没有人负责，常常有红砖掉在地上。丢掉的红砖，渐渐陷在地里，越陷越深，有的深达两尺多，也没有人过问。附近的居民，不管白天黑夜，任意到这里来拣砖头，谁也不管。直到现在，还有很多红砖散失在道路上，水沟里和田野上。在一条宽阔的土路上，我看见几十个工人正在筑路，他们把土翻开，土里面还埋着一尺多厚的红砖。我走过工人村，几乎发见每间房子的四周都遗留着破碎的砖头和石块。这些砖头多半已陷在地里，和地面相平，只微微露出红色。
    我要离开铁西工人村的时候，忽然看见一个穿着黑棉袄的老汉，扛着一根三公尺多长的木料，向工地外面走去。一个工人跑上去，挡住他：“你为什么拿我们的木料？”这位老汉不慌不忙地答道：
    “过去很多人都拿了，你们也没有管，为什么这回你偏偏要管呢？”他很不高兴地放下了这根木料走开了。去年重工业部建设工程公司修筑工人村时，曾经丢失了一些木料。工人们很不高兴，说：“我们做门窗，连一块小木头都舍不得丢掉。我们好容易把剩下的木头，放在一起，交上去，因为没有人负责保管，木头就不见了。”今年重工业部建设工程公司把去年积压的五百多立方公尺的木料交给铁西冬训班保管。冬训班随便把这些木料丢在露天地里。附近的居民常来拿走这些木料，给自己盖房子。工人家属们也到这里拿木料去烧火。厨房、锅炉房的人把这些木料当作最好的燃料来煮饭、烧水。现在这五百多立方公尺的木料，只剩下了两百多立方公尺。浪费掉的三百多立方公尺的木料，由谁负责呢？该谁来赔偿呢？谁也不知道。木工队队长杨连仲告诉我，他们曾经告诉冬训班的两个主任，要求他们好好保存这批木料。这两个主任听了之后，点点头，就不闻不问了。他们眼睁睁地看着这些木料浪费了，还不在乎，居然认为：“反正是为员工的福利用掉的。”
    重工业部建设工程公司材料科科长崔尚仁说：“在哪个工地上，你都能看见很多装洋灰的纸袋，丢在地上。有些工友撕开这些纸袋，围在身上。有些工友拿起铁镐，一下子就把洋灰纸袋凿开，倒出洋灰来。但是，谁也没有想一想：这些纸袋还可以用，还可以卖钱。”去年，一个用过的洋灰纸袋至少可以卖三千元。一吨洋灰，就有二十个纸袋。去年重工业部建设工程公司共用二万八千多吨洋灰，就有五十八万个洋灰纸袋不翼而飞了。这五十万个洋灰纸袋，如果没有弄坏，至少可以卖十七亿多元。但是谁曾经注意了呢？这价值十七亿元多的纸袋，都埋葬在土里了。
    这些现象的产生，是因为在工地上，运送材料没有专人负责；发送材料没有一定的制度；退不退材料，没有人过问；使用材料不讲求节约；用过了材料，到处乱丢；遗失了材料，没有人追问。工人们说：“在我们工地上，遍地是黄金呀！”的确！在许多工地上，你可以看到很多丢掉的黄砂、红砖、石块、洋灰、木材、铁管和钢筋。在有些人看来，这些宝贵的材料，不是金钱，不是劳动人民的血汗。当一个人看见一张人民币丢在地上，他会马上拾起来，连连叫道：“这是钱呀！怎么丢在地上，没有人管呢？”但有些人看见丢在地上价值好几千万人民币的材料，却无动于衷，不闻不问。这是什么道理呢？因为他们以为“浪费些材料，算不了什么”。但是他们不想一想：浪费掉的材料值多少人民币呵！浪费一立方公尺的石块，就是十二万元；浪费一立方公尺的黄砂，就是七万元；浪费一把洋灰，就是好几千元。根据初步统计：去年重工业部建设工程公司材料科仅仅在一些主要材料的采购、运输和保管上，就白白浪费了六十亿元。由此可见：浪费些材料，不是“算不了什么”，而是对国家建设的莫大损害。砂石、红砖、洋灰、木料、钢筋，这些祖国建设必需的材料，在今天是多么地缺乏呵！没有红砖，没有洋灰，没有木料，没有钢筋，没有砂石，哪里能建设成高大的工厂、雄伟的楼房和美丽的学校呢？浪费了这些材料，就等于延迟了国家建设的速度，就等于阻碍了国家工业化的到来。这不是很明白的道理吗？
