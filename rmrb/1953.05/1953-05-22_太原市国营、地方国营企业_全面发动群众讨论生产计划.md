Taiyuan State-Owned and Local State-Owned Enterprises
Fully Mobilize the Masses to Discuss Production Plans

The work of mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate the 1953 production plan in various state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan City began in early April. By mid-May, it had moved from the pilot stage in a few units and workshops to a stage of comprehensive development. Except for a few units that started earlier and progressed faster (such as Factory 247 and Dongshan Coal Mine), which have completed the formulation of workshop, work section, team, and individual plans and are discussing the establishment of liaison contracts, most other factories and mines are in the midst of intense discussions. It is estimated that most units will gradually conclude in May.

Based on an analysis of materials from twenty-three factories and mines (excluding capital construction units), the current development of the work is uneven, and can be roughly divided into three categories: First, leading cadres recognize the importance of formulating plans, made early preparations, and mobilized the masses relatively fully. As a result, the plan discussions are relatively detailed and specific, and the plans formulated are advanced. These factories and mines not only have task requirements in their plans but also found key issues and solutions. Such factories and mines include Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Taiyuan Machine Factory, among eight units. Second, the masses were initially mobilized, and the plan discussions were relatively earnest and detailed. However, because leading cadres did not do a good job of preparing, they could not promptly solve practical problems, and the determination and implementation of advanced plan targets were affected. Such factories and mines include Taiyuan Flour Mill and Taiyuan Printing Factory, among six units. Third, leading cadres did not recognize the importance of formulating plans, made extremely poor preparations, and did not ideologically mobilize the masses. As a result, the discussion of plans became a formality. Some units remained in the key pilot stage for a long time. Such factories and mines include Taiyuan Chemical Plant and Leather Factory, among nine units.

The first and second categories of factories and mines have the following characteristics in mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate plans:

First, fully mobilizing the masses and opposing conservative thinking is a prerequisite for formulating good plans. When starting to discuss the plans, all units universally conducted ideological education on the new tasks in the new period for the employees, especially the education on the three major tasks. Some units also specifically analyzed the ideological problems of the employees and conducted persuasion and mobilization based on specific situations, which all achieved good results. The Ironmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant used the method of detailed accounting to educate the masses. The department had not completed its tasks well for the past three years, and its losses were equivalent to thirty fighter planes or twenty-eight thousand bicycles. This vivid fact greatly educated the workers. At the beginning, the employees of the Refractory Materials Department of the factory had serious conservative ideas and were afraid of setting the plan targets too high, fearing that they would not be able to complete the tasks and suffer losses in the future. However, after in-depth mobilization by the leadership and detailed research by the workers, it was proved that the potential of the equipment was still very large. For example, in the past, the capacity of the drying pit of the department often only reached 47 kilograms per square meter. After detailed calculations by the workers, it was proved that 67 kilograms per square meter could be accommodated, increasing the capacity by 42.6 percent. The conservative thinking of the leading cadres in some units was very serious. This kind of thinking can only be overcome after the masses take action.

Second, in the process of mobilizing the masses to discuss plans, it is necessary to closely combine the struggle against bureaucracy and earnestly solve practical problems. Only in this way can the masses be well mobilized and the plans well formulated. Leading cadres in some factories and mines often cannot go deep into the workshops and teams to understand the situation in a timely manner, and they believe that "the plan is issued, and everything is fine." They do not pay enough attention to the various specific difficulties and problems encountered by workers in production. Some workers said:
"The enthusiasm of everyone is suppressed by the leading cadres." In the first twenty-five days of mobilizing the masses to formulate plans, the employees of the Steelmaking Department only found thirty-seven tricks. After the Party Committee clearly put forward the slogan of anti-bureaucracy, and the leading cadres of the department cleaned up the tricks that had not been dealt with or had not been dealt with well in the past, the employees found one hundred and nineteen new tricks in five days. After the leading cadres dealt with one hundred and twenty-four tricks in a timely manner and rewarded thirty-eight people, the morale of the employees was even higher, and they found another forty-five tricks in five days, which made a great contribution to the improvement of production.

Third, grasping key issues and organizing subject competitions is the best way to combine the discussion of plans with the completion of current tasks. For example, after analyzing the six key problems in the production of the Jin Tongyi team in the Metalworking Workshop of Taiyuan Machine Factory during the plan discussion, they mobilized everyone to find tricks to solve them. As a result, these problems were solved by the workers, which greatly improved the production level of the team. After solving their own key problems, it is no problem for the Han Baolin team in the workshop to complete the annual task four months and eighteen days ahead of schedule in accordance with the requirements of the national plan indicators. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant adopted two methods in this regard, which achieved good results, namely: 1. Aiming at the major key problems existing in various production departments, use rewards to mobilize the masses to solve them. 2. In order to formulate advanced technical norms and plan indicators, the factory organized three shifts of workers to take turns performing techniques in order to discover and summarize the advantages of operation techniques. They called this a "technical meeting." For example, the leaders of the Coking Department required the crusher to crush 50 tons of coal per hour, and the workers thought the requirement was too high. Through the "technical meeting," worker Li Fengchun crushed 81.208 tons in one hour during the performance, ensuring that 91.9% of the coal pieces were below 3 mm (previously 85% to 90%). After the "technical meeting," the coking speed was shortened from 15 minutes to 9 minutes.

Fourth, attention must be paid to the broadness of mass mobilization and the comprehensiveness of plan indicators. The more advanced units not only mobilized the workers but also mobilized the business and technical personnel; not only had output indicators but also quality and cost indicators. After the production plan indicators were issued, Taiyuan Machine Factory carried out a series of tasks, such as convening symposiums for technical personnel and veteran workers to formulate technical organization measures plans; at the same time, it mobilized various relevant business departments to discuss and formulate safety measures plans and welfare and health plans. In this way, the entire factory was mobilized and laid the foundation for moving towards planned management.

Due to the uneven development of the movement, there are still many serious problems in those relatively backward units. For example, some factories and mines have not really mobilized the masses, and the work of formulating plans is still limited to a small circle of people; some employees believe that "the tricks have been exhausted, and the potential has been exhausted," while others are afraid of setting the indicators too high; business personnel in functional departments have not yet taken action at all, or even have no direction for action. The root cause of the poor development of the work in these factories and mines is that the leading cadres still lack a clear understanding of formulating plans and lack a high sense of responsibility for managing the people's enterprises. Therefore, they treat such a major event as mobilizing the masses to discuss the national plan with a simple and perfunctory attitude. In order to reverse this situation, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed these units to fully mobilize the masses in a comprehensive manner, use the method of carrying out criticism and self-criticism to expose the main problems existing in the current production and expose bureaucracy; then, on this basis, organize various "special subject competitions" and "technical meetings," carry out the trick-finding movement, solve the current existing problems, and ensure that the production plan indicators can be determined on an advanced basis, and then formulate work plans and establish and implement various responsibility systems in order to comprehensively do a good job in planned management.

    太原市国营、地方国营企业
    全面发动群众讨论生产计划
    太原市各国营、地方国营厂矿发动群众讨论和制定一九五三年生产计划的工作，从四月上旬开始，到五月中旬止，由少数单位、少数车间的典型试验阶段进入全面开展的阶段。除个别开始得较早，进展较快的单位（如二四七厂、东山煤矿）已订完车间、工段、小组及个人计划，正在讨论订立联系合同外，其余大部厂矿正在紧张地讨论中，估计大部分单位在五月内即可陆续结束。
    根据二十三个厂矿（基本建设单位除外）的材料分析，目前工作的发展是不平衡的，大致可分为三类：第一类、领导干部认识订计划的重要性，准备工作做得早，群众发动得比较充分，因而计划讨论的比较细致、具体，订出的计划也是先进的。这类厂矿的计划中不但有任务的要求，而且找到了关键问题和解决的办法。这类厂矿有太原钢铁厂、太原机器厂等八个单位。第二类、初步发动了群众，计划讨论得也比较认真、细致，但由于领导干部没有做好准备工作，不能及时地解决实际问题，先进计划指标的确定及贯彻都受到影响。这类厂矿有太原面粉厂、太原印刷厂等六个单位。第三类、领导干部没有认识订计划的重要性，准备工作做得极差，没有从思想上发动群众，因而讨论计划流于形式。有的单位则长期停留在重点试验阶段。这类厂矿有太原化学厂、皮革厂等九个单位。
    第一类和第二类厂矿在发动群众讨论和制定计划的工作上，都有以下几个特点：
    第一、充分发动群众，反对保守思想，这是订好计划的先决条件。各单位在开始讨论计划时，都普遍地对职工进行了新时期新任务的思想教育，特别是三大任务的教育。有些单位并具体地分析了职工的思想问题，针对具体情况进行说服动员，均收到了良好的效果。太原钢铁厂炼铁部用算细账的办法教育了群众。该部三年来未很好完成任务，其损失相当于三十架战斗机或二万八千辆自行车。这一活生生的事实，大大教育了工人群众。该厂耐火材料部的职工，在开始时保守思想严重，害怕把计划指标定高了完不成任务将来吃亏。但经过领导方面深入动员，并组织职工群众详细研究之后，证明设备潜力仍然很大。如该部干燥坑过去的容量经常只达每平方公尺四十七公斤，经工人群众详细计算后，证明每平方公尺可容六十七公斤，提高容量百分之四十二点六。有些单位的领导干部，保守思想很严重。这种思想只有群众行动起来以后才能克服。
    第二、发动群众讨论计划的过程中，必须紧紧结合反官僚主义，认真解决实际问题，这样才能把群众发动得好，计划制订得好。一部分厂矿的领导干部经常不能深入车间、小组，及时地了解下情，而认为“计划下达，万事大吉”，对工人在生产中所遇到的各种具体困难和问题关心不够。有的工人说：
    “大家的劲头都被领导干部压下去了。”炼钢部在发动群众订计划的头二十五天中，职工只找到三十七个窍门；到党委会明确提出了反官僚主义的口号，以及该部领导干部把以往未处理和处理得不好的窍门加以清理以后，在五天内职工便找到了一百一十九个新窍门。领导干部及时处理了一百二十四个窍门，并奖励了三十八个人之后，职工情绪更高涨，在五天中又找到四十五个窍门，对生产的提高有很大的贡献。
    第三、抓住关键问题，组织课题竞赛，是把讨论计划和完成当前任务结合起来的最好方法。如太原机器厂金工车间金同义小组在讨论计划中，分析了小组生产中的六个关键问题之后，发动大家找窍门解决，结果这些问题都被工友们解决了，使该组的生产水平大大提高一步。该车间韩保林小组在解决了自己的关键问题之后，按照国家计划指标的要求，提前四个月零十八天完成全年任务是没有问题的。太原钢铁厂在这方面采用两个办法，收到很好的效果，即：一、针对各生产部门存在的重大关键问题，用奖励的办法发动群众加以解决。二、为了制订出先进的技术定额和计划指标，该厂组织三班工人轮流表演技术，以便发现和总结操作技术上的优点。他们称这为“技术会师”。如炼焦部领导方面要求粉碎机每小时粉碎五十吨煤，工人都认为要求太高。通过“技术会师”，工友李逢春在表演时，一小时粉碎了八十一吨又二百零八公斤，保证三米厘以下的煤块达百分之九十一点九（过去是百分之八十五至九十）。经“技术会师”之后，在出焦速度上由十五分钟缩短至九分钟。
    第四、必须注意发动群众的广泛性及计划指标的全面性。较先进的各单位不但发动了工人群众，而且发动了业务、技术人员；不但有产量指标，而且有质量、成本指标。太原机器厂在生产计划指标下达之后，进行了一系列的工作，如召集了技术人员、老工人座谈会，制定了技术组织措施计划；同时发动了各有关业务部门，讨论和制定了安全措施计划及福利卫生计划。这样就把全厂都带动起来，并为走向计划管理打下基础。
    由于运动发展的不平衡，那些比较落后的单位目前还有很多严重的问题。例如有些厂矿还没有真正发动起群众，订计划工作还停留在少数人的圈子内；有些职工认为“窍门找绝、潜力挖光”，有些则怕把指标定高了；职能部门业务人员还完全没有行动起来，甚至还没有行动方向。这些厂矿的工作所以开展得不好，其根源之一是领导干部至今对订计划缺乏明确认识，对管理好人民企业缺乏高度的责任心，因而以简单草率的态度对待发动群众讨论国家计划这样重大的事。为了扭转这一情况，中共太原市委指示这些单位必须全面地充分发动群众，用开展批评与自我批评的方法，揭发当前生产中存在的主要问题，揭发官僚主义；然后在此基础上组织各种“专题竞赛”、“技术会师”，开展找窍门运动，解决当前存在的问题，务使生产计划指标能在一个先进基础上定下来，进而订好作业计划及建立和贯彻各种责任制，以便全面作好计划管理工作。
