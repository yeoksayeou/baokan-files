    The leadership relationship issue of Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School is being resolved

    A letter from the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government: The letter from Comrade Gao Jihou and Comrade Wang Jialin, Chairman of the Student Union of Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, published on April 18, reflected the state of Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School losing leadership and being unattended during the transfer. The content of the letter is basically correct. The reason for this situation is that the original Northeast Ministry of Education failed to make proper arrangements for the adjusted school building issue when it decided to transfer Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School to the leadership of Harbin Institute of Technology. In order to ensure the normal progress of the teaching work of Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, our ministry notified the Northeast Education Bureau to temporarily set up Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School separately, under the leadership of the Harbin Education Bureau. However, on April 11, representatives from the Northeast Education Bureau, Harbin Education Bureau, and Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School proposed that Harbin City had determined to build a new school building for the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School near the preparatory course of Harbin Institute of Technology, and the loss from changing the construction plan was too great. They requested to proceed according to the original plan. After research by our ministry, the Northeast Education Bureau and Harbin Institute of Technology have been instructed to negotiate, based on the principle that "the material equipment and teaching work of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School should not be damaged due to the transfer of leadership relations," on issues such as the Northeast Education Bureau being responsible for solving the problem of the school's newly built school buildings being insufficient, the transfer of all original cadres, teachers, and equipment, and the continued responsibility of the Songjiang Provincial Department of Education and Harbin Education Bureau to assist in the enrollment, teaching work, and teacher allocation of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School. If the above issues can be resolved, our ministry agrees to transfer Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School to the leadership of Harbin Institute of Technology and complete the handover procedures as soon as possible (the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School will continue to have classes in the original school building before the new school building is completed); if issues such as basic construction cannot be reasonably resolved, the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School should still be set up separately and led by the Harbin Education Bureau or the Songjiang Provincial Department of Education.

    In the work of transferring Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary Schools to the leadership of higher education institutions, we initially lacked specific instructions, did not explain what was allowed and what was not allowed in the transfer process, and how to carry out specific leadership. Later, when some schools had problems with school buildings during the transfer process, our ministry issued a notice on how to solve the school building problem when Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary Schools were transferred to the leadership of higher education institutions, but we did not conduct timely inspections; therefore, we should also bear certain responsibility for the unplanned and unled phenomenon that occurred during the transfer of Harbin Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School to the leadership of Harbin Institute of Technology. It was inappropriate for the original Northeast Ministry of Education to hand over such an important task to the Harbin Education Bureau and Harbin Institute of Technology for joint consultation, and to fail to solve the school building problem in a timely manner after it occurred; we have criticized them for this.

### 哈尔滨工农速成中学的领导关系问题正在解决中

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    哈尔滨工农速成中学的领导关系问题正在解决中
    中央人民政府高等教育部来信：四月十八日报上所载哈尔滨工农速成中学学生会主席高继厚、王佳琳同志来信，反映了哈尔滨工农速成中学在移交时失去领导、无人照顾的状态等情况，信中所谈基本上是正确的。发生这个情况的原因是：原东北教育部决定将哈尔滨工农速成中学移归哈尔滨工业大学领导时，对调整后的校舍问题未能作妥善安排。我部为使哈尔滨工农速成中学的教学工作能正常进行，曾通知东北教育局把哈尔滨工农速成中学暂仍单独设置，由哈尔滨市教育局领导。但四月十一日，东北教育局、哈尔滨市教育局、哈尔滨工农速成中学来人提出：哈尔滨市已确定在哈尔滨工业大学预科附近为工农速成中学修建新校舍，改变修建计划损失过大，请求仍按原定计划办理。经我部研究后，已指示东北教育局与哈尔滨工业大学根据“工农速成中学的物质设备和教学工作不能因移转领导关系而遭受损失”的原则，对东北教育局负责解决该校新建校舍不敷应用问题，该校原有干部、师资、设备全部移交问题，以及松江省教育厅、哈尔滨市教育局今后仍负责帮助工农速成中学的招生、教学工作及师资配备问题进行协商。如以上问题能获得解决，我部同意将哈尔滨工农速成中学移交哈尔滨工业大学领导，并尽早办理接交手续（在新校舍未竣工前工农速成中学仍在原校内上课）；如基本建设等问题不能合理解决，则工农速成中学仍应单独设置，由哈尔滨市教育局或松江省教育厅领导。
    在工农速成中学移归高等学校领导这一工作中，我们在开始时缺乏具体交待，没有说明在移交工作中准许什么，不准许什么，如何进行具体领导。及至各地移转过程中有些学校校舍发生了问题，我部发出了关于工农速成中学移归高等学校领导时如何解决校舍问题的通知，但却没有及时进行检查；因此，对于哈尔滨工农速成中学移交哈尔滨工业大学领导时发生的无计划、无领导的现象，我们也要负一定的责任。原东北教育部把这样一件重大的工作交给哈尔滨市教育局和哈尔滨工业大学共同协商，发生了校舍问题后也未能及时的给以解决，这是不妥当的；我们已对他们提出批评。
