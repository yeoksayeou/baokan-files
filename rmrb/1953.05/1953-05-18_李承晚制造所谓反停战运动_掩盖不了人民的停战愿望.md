    Syngman Rhee's So-Called Anti-Armistice Movement
    Cannot Conceal the People's Desire for Armistice
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 15th] In order to support Harriman's delaying tactics in Panmunjom, certain warmongers in the United States recently instructed the puppet Syngman Rhee to create so-called anti-armistice movements in various parts of South Korea, but this still cannot conceal the South Korean people's desire for an armistice. A Reuters dispatch from Seoul on May 13th revealed: The South Korean people's support for Syngman Rhee's anti-armistice movement is "very weak" because the war has caused them to lose their families and homes. Although many gatherings and parades have been held in various parts of South Korea, "the crowds waving flags are all ordered to listen to propaganda speeches." For example, in Seoul, households in each district were ordered to send one person to participate in the demonstration; in Gyeongju, when the demonstrators shouted "Advance to the Yalu River," the Rhee army soldiers passing by threw their uniforms to them and said: "You go, we don't want to go." In Busan, many of the demonstrators appeared to be prostitutes.

    李承晚制造所谓反停战运动
    掩盖不了人民的停战愿望
    【新华社十五日讯】美国某些好战分子为了给哈利逊在板门店的拖延策略撑腰，最近指示傀儡李承晚在南朝鲜各地制造所谓反对停战的运动，但是这仍然掩盖不了南朝鲜人民要求停战的愿望。路透社五月十三日从汉城发出的消息透露：南朝鲜人民对于李承晚反对停战运动的支持是“很薄弱的”，因为战争使他们家破人亡。在南朝鲜各地虽然举行了许多集会和游行，但是“那些摇着旗子的群众都是奉命去听宣传演说的”。例如在汉城，市内各区住户每户奉命要派一个人参加示威游行；在庆州，当示威游行的人喊着“打到鸭绿江去”的时候，路过的李伪军士兵却把军装丢给他们说：“你们去吧，我们不愿意去。”在釜山，许多示威的人似乎都是娼妓。
