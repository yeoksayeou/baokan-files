Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, May 5th: The Ningxia Provincial People's Government has formulated a plan for implementing ethnic regional autonomy in 1953. The plan stipulates that this year, two Hui Autonomous Regions and Mongolian Autonomous Regions equivalent to the level of a special district, three equivalent to the level of a district, and twenty-five equivalent to the level of a township will be established throughout the province. After the establishment of these ethnic regional autonomous governments, the people of all ethnic minorities, who account for 29.3 percent of the total population of Ningxia Province, will further realize their rights to be masters of their own affairs and enjoy ethnic equality.

The Ningxia Provincial People's Government's 1953 plan for implementing ethnic regional autonomy was formulated based on the specific circumstances of each ethnic group. For example, in Jinji, Lingwu, Tongxin counties and Wuzhong city, the Hui population is relatively concentrated and the areas are adjacent to each other, so it was decided to establish a Hui Autonomous Region equivalent to the level of a special district. In other areas, because the distribution of the Hui population is largely dispersed and small-scale concentrated, it was decided to establish Hui Autonomous Regions equivalent to the district or township level separately.

The plan particularly emphasized that the establishment of ethnic regional autonomous governments in various places must be based on ethnic equality and voluntariness. At present, various localities are carrying out consultations on the preparations for the establishment of ethnic regional autonomous governments. Cadres in Jinji, Lingwu, Wuzhong and other counties and cities are working hard to study ethnic policies.

    宁夏省订出今年实施民族区域自治计划
   【新华社银川五日电】宁夏省人民政府已订出一九五三年实施民族区域自治的计划。计划中规定：今年将在全省建立两个相当于专区级、三个相当于区级和二十五个相当于乡级的回族自治区和蒙族自治区。这些民族区域自治政权建立后，占宁夏省人口总数百分之二十九点三的各少数民族人民，将进一步实现当家作主和享受到民族平等的权利。
    宁夏省人民政府一九五三年实施民族区域自治的计划，是根据各民族的各种具体情况制定的。例如金积、灵武、同心三县和吴忠市，回族人口都比较集中，而且地区相邻，因此决定成立一个相当于专区级的回族自治区。在其他各地，因为回族人口的分布情况是大分散，小集中，所以决定分别成立相当于区级或乡级的回族自治区。
    计划中特别强调了各地民族区域自治政权的成立，必须建筑在民族平等和自愿的基础之上。现在，各地正在进行协商关于成立民族区域自治政权的各项准备工作。金积、灵武、吴忠等县市的干部正在紧张地学习民族政策。
