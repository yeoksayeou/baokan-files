Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 22nd: The U.S. chief negotiator, Harrison, has consistently failed to answer a question: Why is the U.S. afraid of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission effectively exercising its powers and afraid of allowing prisoners of war to hear a full explanation of their repatriation rights? The experiences of some Chinese People's Volunteer Army wounded and sick personnel recently repatriated from the U.S. prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island provide a clear answer to this question. They were beaten into cripples for resisting forced tattooing and have large scars on their arms left after being forcibly tattooed.

Many Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war were severely injured in U.S. prisoner of war camps for opposing forced tattooing. In order to tattoo words on the prisoners of war that would make them fear returning home, Kuomintang secret agents, at the instigation and with the connivance of the U.S. military prisoner of war camp authorities, subjected at least half of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to various tortures. Returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war said that many who did not want to be tattooed were blinded, had their arms broken, or their legs crippled.

Volunteer soldier Zhang Fuqing did not want to be tattooed, and Kuomintang secret agents beat him every ten days to half a month, tormenting him for more than half a year. Later, the Kuomintang secret agents tattooed him on both arms after knocking him unconscious. However, after he woke up, he immediately endured the pain and scraped off the words. Another prisoner of war scraped off the words, and the enemy beat him again and tattooed him again, and he scraped them off again; he was knocked unconscious three times, and tattooed three times.

In June 1951, when the U.S. military prisoner of war camp authorities and Chiang Kai-shek bandits' secret agents were preparing to force the prisoners of war to tattoo, they publicly announced: Those who oppose tattooing will be severely beaten without exception; only those who are tattooed can eat their fill, receive intact clothes, sleep and speak without restrictions, and need not ask for leave to go to the toilet. They also said: "Whoever refuses to be tattooed will never be allowed to return to the mountain alive; if they are beaten to death, the United Nations will be responsible."

In September of the same year, when the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents forced our captured personnel to fill out so-called "tattoo application forms," no one was willing to fill them out. Later, although the U.S. side used brutal and shameless means to force some people to be tattooed, our captured personnel still said: "Even if we are tattooed, we will still return to our motherland!"

Among the returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, some had been forced to have tattoos on their arms. However, except for one mentally ill patient, all the others had long endured the pain and scraped off the humiliating marks with razor blades, burned them off with cigarette butts, or removed them by other means, leaving only a large scar on their arms. They said that after they were forced to be tattooed, U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents had threatened them not to return home. The U.S. side never conveyed to our captured personnel the statement made by the Korean and Chinese side last April welcoming the return of captured personnel, although the U.S. representatives had repeatedly claimed that they had conveyed it to "every prisoner of war."

The act of forcing prisoners of war to tattoo is undeniable by the U.S. side, and even the U.S. press has partially revealed these facts. The situation is very clear: as long as the prisoners of war are truly free to express their will, they will definitely demand to go home. The U.S. side is obviously afraid of this consequence.

    美方限制中立国遣返委员会有效执行职权是因为害怕暴露自己强迫扣留战俘的事实
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美方首席谈判代表哈利逊一直没有回答一个问题：为什么美方害怕中立国遣返委员会有效地执行职权，害怕让战俘听到关于他们遣返权利的充分解释？从新近由美方济州岛战俘营遣返归来的一些中国人民志愿军伤病员的经历中，可以找到这个问题的清楚的答复。他们因为反抗强迫刺字而被打成残废，臂上还有被强迫刺字后留下的大块疤痕。
    中国人民志愿军被俘人员中有许多人在美军战俘营中因为反对强迫刺字而被打得重伤。为了在战俘身上刺下使他们对回国发生疑惧的字样，国民党特务在美军战俘营当局唆使和纵容下，曾对至少有一半中国人民志愿军被俘人员施行过各种肉刑。归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员说，很多不愿刺字的人被打瞎了眼睛，打断了胳膊，或者双腿被打成残废。
    志愿军被俘人员张福清不愿刺字，国民党特务每隔十天半月就痛打他一次，把他折磨了半年多。后来还是国民党特务在把他打昏了以后，在他双臂上刺上了字样。但他苏醒过来后，立即忍痛刮掉了这几个字。另一个被俘人员把字刮掉以后，敌人又打他，又给他刺字，他又刮掉；前后他被打晕了三回，也被刺了三回字。
    一九五一年六月美军战俘营当局和蒋匪特务在准备强迫战俘们刺字时，曾经公开宣布：反对刺字者一律毒打无赦，只有刺字的人才可以吃饱饭，领到不破的衣服，睡觉和说话不受限制，大小便不必请假。他们又说：“谁要不肯刺字，横竖不能放虎回山，打死由联合国负责。”
    同年九月，当美蒋特务强迫我方被俘人员填写所谓“刺字申请书”时，没有一个人愿意填写。后来，美方虽然用残暴无耻的手段迫使一些人刺了字，但我方被俘人员依然说：“就是刺上字，我们也要回祖国！”
    归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员中，也有一部分人曾被迫在臂上刺了字。但是除了一名精神病患者外，其余的人都早已忍痛把这污辱他们的字迹用刀片刮掉，用香烟头烧掉，或用其他方法去掉，只在臂上留下一个很大的疤痕。他们说，在他们被迫刺字以后，美蒋特务曾经恫吓他们不要回国。美方从未对我方被俘人员传达朝中方面去年四月欢迎被俘人员归来的声明，虽然美方代表曾多次扬言他们已对“每一个战俘”作过传达。
    强迫战俘刺字的行为是美方无法否认的，连美国报刊也曾经部分透露过这些事实。情形很清楚：只要让战俘真正自由地表示意志，他们就一定要求回家。美方显然害怕这种后果。
