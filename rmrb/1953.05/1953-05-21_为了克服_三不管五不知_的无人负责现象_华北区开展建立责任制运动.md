    To Overcome the “Three No-Man’s-Lands and Five Don't-Knows” Phenomenon of No One Taking Responsibility
    The North China Region Launches a Responsibility System Movement

    [This Newspaper Reports] The North China Construction Engineering Bureau, in order to overcome waste and the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility in construction, has decided to launch a mass movement from May to July to oppose waste and the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility in construction, and to establish and strengthen the responsibility system.

    According to preliminary inspection materials, the waste and phenomenon of no one taking responsibility in construction projects in various parts of the North China region are very serious. Workers of the First Engineering Company directly under the North China Construction Engineering Bureau criticize the company as "three no-man's-lands, five don't-knows"—the company cannot manage the work areas, the work areas cannot manage the construction sites, and the construction sites cannot manage the workers; the salary department does not know the salary situation, the enterprise department does not know the accounts, the labor department does not know the number of workers, the personnel department does not know the situation of cadres, and the engineering department does not know the progress of the project. The company's material department accepted more than 4 billion yuan worth of materials, which were delayed for eight months without anyone handling them. The second work area had more than 1,000 rolls of asphalt felt that were not stored properly and became invalid over time and were returned to the company's material department; the material officer of the material department did not check and sent them to the first work area; the construction worker of the first work area found that the asphalt felt was broken and sent it back to the material department. Round-trip transportation wasted a lot of money. The construction site of the North China People's Revolutionary University used 2,850 fir poles as purlins, but the material department did not know and reported the loss. Because the construction workers did not return the excess materials, grabbing and using them indiscriminately, such a strange thing happened: the material department did not spend any materials, but built two transformer rooms. In terms of labor allocation, the North China People's Revolutionary University construction site did not record any sporadic employment, resulting in 20,000 work quotas being unknown where they were used. The fourth work area needed more than 20 ash workers, but more than 20 stone workers were transferred. In total, the company wasted 25,000 workdays due to waiting and idling last year. No one was responsible for checking the quality of the project. Among the nine oil depots and barrack concrete projects undertaken by the company, 20% had honeycombs and 10% had exposed rebar.

    The serious phenomenon of no one taking responsibility in the First Engineering Company directly under the North China Construction Engineering Bureau also generally exists in the construction system of the North China region, causing great waste. The Zhangjiakou City construction system asked for money on the one hand and stockpiled more than 11 billion yuan worth of poplar wood and hardware materials on the other hand. When a construction site of a Tianjin Construction Company promoted the "hands squeezing mortar" method, no one was responsible for explaining the rationale, so the "hands squeezing" became "hands waving," and three repair teams had to follow the bricklayers. When the construction worker found that five layers of bricks had been laid without plastering and reported to the engineer, the engineer said: "There is a competition going on, don't dampen their enthusiasm." The Wangchuanchang worker dormitory construction site in Tianjin built 3,000 houses, and 2,000 of them were reworked. This chaotic phenomenon of no one taking responsibility is also reflected in design, site layout, safety and health, wages and welfare, and other tasks. The Handan Construction Company designed a bathhouse for the Cishan Mine and sent the warehouse drawings. The construction unit did not check, and only realized it when the house was built to the window.

    In response to these waste and no-one-responsible phenomena, leaders of various units launched workers to expose and inspect them during the winter training period. However, the staff's understanding of the harm of the no-one-responsible phenomenon and the necessity of establishing a responsibility system is still not enough, especially there are no specific ways to overcome the no-one-responsible phenomenon. For this reason, the North China Construction Engineering Bureau decided to launch a mass movement to establish a responsibility system throughout the region from May to July. Since April 17th, the North China Construction Engineering Bureau organs have listed opposing waste and the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility in construction as one of the key contents of the anti-bureaucracy struggle. By checking work and summarizing experiences and lessons, it is required that cadres of the entire bureau have a deeper ideological understanding of the harm and seriousness of waste and no one taking responsibility, strengthen the connection between various departments, improve the working system, and improve leadership methods.

### 为了克服“三不管五不知”的无人负责现象  华北区开展建立责任制运动

    为了克服“三不管五不知”的无人负责现象
    华北区开展建立责任制运动
    【本报讯】华北建筑工程局为了克服施工中的浪费和无人负责现象，决定从五月到七月开展反对施工中的浪费和无人负责现象的群众运动，建立与加强责任制度。
    根据初步检查出的材料来看，华北区各地建筑工程施工中的浪费和无人负责现象是很严重的。华北建筑工程局直属第一工程公司的工人们对公司的批评是“三不管，五不知”——公司管不了工区，工区管不了工地，工地管不了工人；工资科不知道工资情况，企业科不知道账目，劳动科不知道工人数字，人事科不知道干部情况，工程科不知道工程进度。该公司器材部接受了四十多亿元的材料，拖延了八个月没有人处理。第二工区有一千多卷油毡没有存放好，日久失效，调回公司器材部；器材部的材料员没有检查，又发给第一工区；第一工区施工员发现油毡已坏，又送回器材部。往返运输，浪费了很多钱。华北人民革命大学工地把二千八百五十根杉槁用做房檩，材料部门不知道，给报了损失。由于施工员不退回多余的材料，乱抓乱用，竟出了这样一件奇怪的事情：材料部门并未支出材料，却盖好了两个变电室的房子。在劳动力调配方面，华北人民革命大学工地因零散用工都没有记载，结果有二万个工额不知用在什么地方。第四工区要二十多个灰土工，却给调去二十多个石头工。总计该公司去年等工、窝工共浪费二万五千个工。工程质量也无人负责检查，该公司承建的九座油库和营房混凝土工程中有蜂窝的占百分之二十，露筋的占百分之十。
    像华北建筑工程局直属第一工程公司这种无人负责的严重现象，在华北区建筑系统中也普遍地存在，造成了很大的浪费。张家口市建筑系统一面伸手要钱，一面又积压了一百一十多亿元的杨木和五金器材。天津市建筑公司某工地推广双手挤浆法时，无人负责讲清道理，结果“双手挤”变成“双手摆”，砌墙的工人后面要跟三个补修小组。当施工员发现砌了五层砖还没有抹灰去报告工程师时，工程师反说：“正在竞赛，不要打击他们的情绪。”天津市王串场工人宿舍工地盖了三千间房子，有二千间返工重作。这种无人负责的混乱现象还表现在设计、现场布置、安全卫生和工资福利等各种工作中。邯郸建筑公司给磁山矿设计澡塘，竟把仓库的图样送去了。施工单位也没有检查，等房子砌到窗口时才发觉。
    对这些浪费和无人负责现象，各单位领导方面曾在冬训期内发动工人揭露和检查了一次。但是职工对无人负责现象的危害和建立责任制的必要性还认识得很不够，特别是如何克服无人负责现象还没有具体办法。为此，华北建筑工程局决定从五月到七月在全区范围内开展一次群众性的建立责任制运动。华北建筑工程局机关内已从四月十七日起，将反对施工中的浪费与无人负责现象，列为反官僚主义斗争的重点内容之一，通过检查工作，总结经验教训，要求全局干部思想上更深刻认识浪费和无人负责的危害性和严重性，加强各部门的联系，健全工作制度，改进领导方法。
