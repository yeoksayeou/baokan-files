Who Are the Persecutors of American Prisoners of War?
	Huang Gang

Not long ago, I saw American prisoners of war in the Biqiao prisoner-of-war camp in Korea. Most of them drew monthly calendars in their diaries, anticipating the date of their return home, and had already planned: on the first day back, who would be the first loved one they would meet, and how they would arrange the first family picnic after their reunion... Now, as the sick and wounded American prisoners of war leave Korea with gratitude and hope for peace, secretly transported back to the United States from Tokyo by the American military and subjected to a disguised imprisonment, these "American boys," as they were repeatedly called by Clark, have only now discovered that all their plans were just a dream.

This is why, while people are rejoicing that the sick and wounded personnel of the Korean and Chinese side are returning home one after another, restoring their free and happy lives, they cannot help but observe the fate of the American prisoners of war after their return with a serious attitude.

Now, all the materials from the American side have shown that it is not others who are mistreating and persecuting American prisoners of war, but the US Department of Defense, senior officials in the Pentagon in Washington, the "Far East Investigation Officers" of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, and "other relevant military departments"; it is they, and only they, who trampled on the human rights of American prisoners of war and deprived them of their freedom.

Associated Press reporter Barnard was the first to directly reveal this information. In his report from Tokyo, he said that some of the repatriated American prisoners of war "are still not free. In a sense, they are still 'prisoners'." They "are confined to US Army hospitals, forbidden from contact with outsiders." Originally, the US Army authorities had already prepared before the prisoners of war were repatriated: to implement a so-called "rehabilitation" plan for American prisoners of war with "attractive things on the street" and other "methods," so as to "restore them politically and psychologically to their original American ways," that is, to make the prisoners of war agree with the views of the US government in all respects. To help with this, they painstakingly arranged for "a group of American women" to go to Munsan, saying that they would first use women to meet these "American boys." However, in the process of implementing the above plan, the "women" and the so-called "attractive things on the street" could not give the American military's special rule any confidence. Therefore, according to Barnard, the American prisoners of war could not "tour the city" in "the brightly lit, or rather, tempting city of Tokyo" when they arrived in Japan—they could not get 24 hours of freedom to leave the US Army hospital. After that, the American prisoners of war were secretly transported back to the United States by plane from Tokyo, and what awaited them there was the "strict interrogation" that the American Army authorities continued to conduct on them, the "extensive talks" that American intelligence personnel continued to administer to them, and the "special attention" that the US Department of Defense would give them—special so-called "psychological corrections" were carried out under specially installed "special equipment."

This is the "luxury treatment" that the Pentagon has "carefully studied" and claimed to give to American prisoners of war! Before the prisoners of war, loyal to their memories, could speak about the humane treatment of the Korean and Chinese side, their identification cards were stamped with "not allowed to meet with reporters."

This is the "natural treatment" that the US senior Army "psychiatric experts" claimed for American prisoners of war after their return! When they were repatriated and returned, they were first surrounded by the US special agency's notorious counter-espionage team. The first thing to do was to "be asked to sign a form, making them responsible for official confidentiality measures," that is, to be "responsible" for the confidentiality measures for conducting germ warfare, and never to reveal the US military's bad deeds and crimes in this regard! This is what the US Army Medical Corps advocates: the families of American prisoners of war "should not treat them too extravagantly" upon their return! Therefore, the vast majority of healthy American prisoners of war, after returning home, still have to be locked up in the Valley Forge Army "Hospital" in Philadelphia, and cannot immediately meet with their beloved family and friends.

This is the "test" that Clark had predicted for American prisoners of war. Clark once openly threatened that if any American prisoner of war dared to reveal the truth about the Korean War, his personal experiences, and his desire for peace to society based on his honest conscience, then it would "destroy his reputation, his family, and his future."

Although the US official arrangement for persecuting these witnesses of the humane treatment of the Korean and Chinese side seems so "strict," their Brigadier General Chancey still issued a not-so-optimistic call in Washington. He predicted: "Most of the repatriated American prisoners of war will encounter some difficulties in psychologically adapting to American 'free life'!" Chancey is the current director of the Psychiatric and Neurological Medical Office of the US Army Medical Department. He tried to blur and alleviate the profound impact of the Korean and Chinese side's lenient policy by advising the American people to view their prisoners of war as "they just went to the nearby pharmacy for a stroll."

Indeed, there is a correct element in Brigadier General Chancey's pessimistic "prediction"; this is not because the capture of American soldiers was "just a stroll to the nearby pharmacy," but because the education of more than two years of real life on the Korean battlefield, coupled with the deprivation of all human rights and freedom immediately after repatriation, prompted them to adopt a very different view from that of American officials toward the American "free life." This view, because it is based on the absolutely true facts, because it is a truth personally experienced and confirmed, is difficult for American officials to "correct" or reverse, even if they feel very headache.

### 谁是美国战俘的迫害者

    谁是美国战俘的迫害者
    黄钢
    不久前，我在朝鲜碧潼战俘营看见了美国战俘，他们多半在自己的日记本上画上月份表，预计着回国的日期，并早已计划好：回国的第一天，先和哪一个亲爱的人儿见面，怎样去布置全家团聚后的第一次野餐……。现在，当美国病伤战俘带着感激的心情和对和平的希望离开朝鲜，被美国军部用飞机从东京秘密地运返美国，并受到变相囚禁的时候，这些一再被克拉克称呼的“美国孩子”们，方才发现自己的一切计划都是一种梦想。
    这就是为什么人们在庆幸朝中被俘病伤人员陆续回国，恢复了他们自由幸福生活的同时，又不得不以严肃的心情，去注视美国战俘归国后的命运的缘故。
    现在，来自美方的全部材料都已表明了：虐待迫害美军战俘的，不是别人，正是美国国防部，正是华盛顿五角大楼的高级官员，正是美联邦调查局的“远东调查官员”，以及“其它有关的军事部门”；正是他们，而且只有他们，蹂躏了美国战俘的人权，剥夺了他们的自由。
    美联社记者巴纳德，第一个直接透露了这种材料。他在东京的报道中说：某些遣返的美国战俘“还是没有获得自由。在某种意义说来，他们现在仍旧是‘俘虏’。”他们“被关在美国陆军医院里，禁止与外人接触。”原来，战俘们被遣返前，美国陆军当局就已经准备好：要以“大街上好看的东西”及其他等等“办法”，实行对于美国战俘的所谓“改造”计划，以便“使他们在政治上和心理上能恢复原来的美国方式”，也就是说，要战俘能在一切方面附和美国政府的看法。为了有助于这一点，他们煞费苦心地布置了“一群美国妇女”到汶山，说是要先用妇女来与这些“美国孩子”们见面。可是，在实行上述计划过程中，“妇女们”与所谓“大街上好看的东西”也不能给予美国军部的特务统治以信心，因此，据巴纳德讲来：美国战俘们在运抵日本时，竟不能在“灯光灿烂的，或者说是富于诱惑力的东京市内”去“观光这个城市”——他们不可能得到离开美国陆军医院二十四小时的自由。这之后，美国战俘们就被人从东京用飞机在严格保密的情形下运返美国，而在那儿等待他们的，那就是美国陆军当局对他们继续进行的“严格的质询”，美国情报人员们对他们继续施行的“广泛的谈话”，以及美国国防部要给予他们的“特别的注意”——在专门装置的“特别设备下”，进行特别的所谓“心理上的矫正”。
    这就是五角大楼“缜密研究”过的，宣称要给予美国战俘们的“豪华的待遇”！当忠实于自己记忆的战俘们要讲出对朝中方面人道的待遇之前，他们身份证上已被盖上了“不准会见记者”的印戳。
    这就是美国高级陆军“精神病专家”所声言的：对于美国战俘返国后的“自然的对待”！当他们遣返归来，首先被美国特务机关臭名远扬的反间谍队所包围的时候，第一样要做的事情是“被要求在一种表格上签名，使他们对官方的保密措施负责”，就是说，要对进行细菌战的保密措施“负责”，绝不许说出美国军部在这方面的劣迹与罪行！这就是美国陆军军医处所主张的：美国战俘的家属们对战俘的归来“不要对他们有过分的款待”！因此，绝大多数是身心健全的美国战俘回国后，还要关进那费城的熔炉谷陆军“医院”，而不得马上与自己亲爱的家人朋友们见面。
    这就是克拉克所预告过的，对于美国战俘们的“考验”。克拉克曾经公开地威胁道：如果有哪一个美国战俘敢依据自己正直的良心来向社会吐露朝鲜战争、个人遭遇的真象，以及和平的愿望，那么，就“可能毁坏他的名誉、他的家庭和他的前途。”
    尽管美国官方对迫害这批朝中方面人道待遇的见证者的布置，是显得如此的“严密”，但他们的钱斯伯陆军准将，还是在华盛顿发出并不乐观的呼声。他预言道：“遣返的美国战俘中的大多数，将在心理上适应美国‘自由生活’时遭遇到一些困难”！钱斯伯是美国现任陆军军医署精神病与神经病医务处处长。他聊以解嘲地想模糊和减轻美国战俘对朝中方面宽待政策的深刻影响，他劝告美国的人们对他们战俘的看法，应当把他们看做“他们只是到附近药房去逛了一下而已”。
    诚然，钱斯伯陆军准将悲观性的“预言”中，有着它正确的成分；这不是因为美国士兵之被俘“只是到附近药房去逛了一下”，而是因为朝鲜战场上两年多现实生活的教育，再加上遣返后立即遭到的剥夺了一切人权和自由，促使他们对于美国的“自由生活”的态度，采取一种与美国官员们大不相同的看法。这种看法，因为是基于千真万确的事实，因为是亲身经历和印证过的真理，所以，尽管美国的官员们感到十分头疼，也是势难“矫正”或挽回的。
