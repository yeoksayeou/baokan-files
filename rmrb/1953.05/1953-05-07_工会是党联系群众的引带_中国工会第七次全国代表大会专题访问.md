The Trade Union is the Party's Guide to Contacting the Masses
—Special Interview on the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
By our reporter Liu Shiping
    Under the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, the working class of our country is striding forward into a new historical period of national economic construction. The convening of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions at this time is of great significance. All the representatives attending this conference, after listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's congratulatory message to the conference on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Liu Ningyi's opening speech, and Comrade Lai Ruoyu's report on the work of Chinese trade unions, have more clearly realized that the trade union is the Party's guide to contacting the masses. The role of the trade union should be "a school for learning management, a school for learning business, and a school of communism." As Comrade Shaoqi quoted Lenin in his congratulatory message to the conference, our trade unions must be able to truly become "builders of a new life" and "educators of new millions of people."
    In order to achieve this task, an important task before the Party and trade union workers is to strengthen the Party's leadership over trade unions in the grassroots organizations of factories and mines, continuously improve the level of trade union work, and closely link the Party and the masses.
    From individual interviews and group discussions, we can often hear representatives from various places mentioning the experience of the 53rd Factory. They all prove from different perspectives that the experience of the 53rd Factory is a model for solving this problem.
    The trade union work of the 53rd Factory was rewarded by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on December 24 last year. At the same time, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a decision to promote the experience of the 53rd Factory's trade union work. At present, in industrial and mining enterprises across the country, some are preparing to promote the experience of the 53rd Factory's trade union work, and some have already implemented the experience of the 53rd Factory's trade union work and have achieved certain gains. All factory and mine cadres who have seriously studied the experience of the 53rd Factory have further realized that "the experience of the 53rd Factory can really solve problems." According to Hu Peiran, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Jiangnan Shipyard, Yang Yugen, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Trade Union Shanghai Electric Power Company Committee, and Duan Kejie, Secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang Linen Mill, the experience of the 53rd Factory is completely applicable to them. Combining their current work of production reform, the experience of the 53rd Factory's trade union work can help them overcome blindness in their work, enable them to clearly understand how the Party should lead the trade union, how the trade union, under the leadership of the Party, can continuously improve its work, establish a normal order of grassroots work, and overcome generalized leadership and the "all-encompassing" leadership method.
    Comrade Hu Peiran said: Before learning from the experience of the 53rd Factory, whenever the Party proposed a central movement, such as the "Three-Anti" movement, democratic reform, and safety and hygiene inspection, the leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League would organize a temporary committee to lead the movement for unified leadership. Under that organizational form, due to the concentration of cadres' strength and unified steps, generally speaking, it had played a great role. During the movement, the work was intense, and the masses were also more fully mobilized. However, once the movement was over, the temporary committee would be dissolved, and the movement would follow. The Party committee would immediately feel that it had lost its reliance, lost contact with the masses, the work would slack off, and the masses' enthusiasm would cool down. Now, in comparison with the experience of the 53rd Factory, it can be clearly seen that this is because the Party and the trade union have not established regular work, and have not paid attention to how to combine the daily work of the trade union in each movement to give play to the organizational role of the trade union. If, in the past, when carrying out general political movements, such an "all-encompassing" leadership method was powerful and could play a certain role, then today, when our country has already begun its new economic construction work, such an "all-encompassing" leadership method is not suitable. Now we have to carry out production reform, strengthen planned management, implement economic accounting, and also have basic construction tasks. In order to guarantee and supervise production, the Party's task is more complex and arduous, requiring more specific, more detailed, and more in-depth leadership. If the Party committee's leadership method still remains at the old "all-encompassing" stage of engaging in "movements," it is obviously not adapted to objective needs. Such an all-encompassing leadership method not only cannot be handled, but also cannot be handled well, and will inevitably weaken the Party's political and ideological leadership, causing the Party committee to fall into the quagmire of pragmatism, and instead weaken the work of the Party and the trade union.
    Comrade Duan Kejie further criticized the past "all-encompassing" leadership method. The work of Zhejiang Linen Mill is relatively good. However, Comrade Duan Kejie said that the leadership work of their factory's Party committee has not yet completely changed the "all-encompassing" leadership method. In the past three years, engaging in political movements has always been more than engaging in production. Whenever a central movement arrived, the Party committee would grab everything. After making a decision at the Party committee meeting, it would convene a general meeting of all factory workers to mobilize and deploy. Although this approach can bring the central task directly to the masses at once, because of the unclear division of labor and unclear responsibilities, trade union cadres at all levels do not know what they should do. They do not have a clear idea in their minds, so they have no way to proactively carry out work to give play to the organizational role of the trade union.
    How should the Party's regular leadership relationship with the trade union be established? Wei Wenfeng, Secretary of the Party Committee of Shenyang Smelter, said that they had not solved this problem until the autumn of 1952 during the increase production and practice economy campaign. The Party committee's leadership over the trade union mainly involved absorbing the chairman of the trade union to participate in the Party committee meetings, and if anything happened temporarily, the Party committee secretary would talk to the chairman of the trade union individually. This created a phenomenon of the trade union relying on the Party committee, moving only when pushed. After they learned from the experience of the 53rd Factory, they realized that such an approach was only the chairman of the trade union accepting the leadership of the Party committee secretary, rather than the collective leadership of the Party committee. Doing so easily leads to the Party's substitution and the trade union chairman's dependence on the Party committee secretary, which limits the trade union's ability to play its organizational role under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, they decided to resolutely establish a Party group in the trade union according to the Party's organizational principles, and realize the Party's leadership over the trade union through the Party group. To do this, it is first necessary to overcome the idea of fearing trouble. The experience of the past six months has proved that it is necessary to conscientiously follow the Party's organizational principles and lead the trade union through the Party group in the trade union. Like the trade union of the 53rd Factory, at the Party group meetings of the trade union, conscientiously follow the Party's instructions, discuss the work plans for each period, the Party's policies, government laws and decrees, instructions from higher-level trade unions, discuss the work center for a certain period, the principles for evaluating models and rewards, the training and transfer of cadres, the re-election of trade union organizations, etc. After the discussion, submit it to the Party committee, and after the Party committee agrees, the trade union members in the Party group submit it to the trade union committee for discussion, amendment, and approval, and it is used as a trade union resolution, and the trade union specifically organizes the masses to implement it. Doing so overcomes the old method of the Party handling everything for the trade union in the past.
    Of course, leading the trade union work through the Party group in the trade union does not mean reducing the leadership responsibility of the Party committee. The Party committee must also regularly discuss the work of the trade union. Qi Tinghan, chairman of the trade union of the 53rd Factory, explained in detail to reporters how their trade union works. Their work center in each period is closely centered around the central slogan put forward by the Party to guarantee and supervise production. In each period, based on the production tasks proposed by the administrative side, the Party formulates annual, quarterly, and monthly guarantee plans, puts forward the Party's work guidelines, principles, steps, slogans, and practices, and also puts forward key requirements for the trade union. For example, in promoting advanced experience, the Party requires the trade union to do a good job in cultivating models, setting up banners, leading and carrying out mass activities to find tricks, and promoting advanced experience. The trade union formulates its own plan according to the requirements of the Party. The Party committee must not only discuss and review the trade union work plan proposed by the Party group, but also grasp the inspection work, and if problems are found in the trade union work, they will be helped to solve them in a timely manner. For example, in the Red Flag competition, they once promoted the method of "all red" and "blue flag urging" in a certain factory. This method was blindly developed when it reached the workshop. All kinds of colorful small flags were hung in the workshop, and they were painted in a mess. On the one hand, the group and the workshop were full of red flags, and the red flag lost its role of leading the backward through the advanced. On the other hand, the result of inserting blue flags created a gap between the advanced and the backward among the workers, and the workers who inserted blue flags could not hold their heads up. The Party committee discovered this deviation, conducted discussions and inspections, pointed out that the method of inserting blue flags was a form of attack and satire on the backward masses, and was an erroneous method of weakening the unity of the workers. The trade union then conducted education among the workers, abolished the method of inserting blue flags, and directed the Red Flag competition from the individual to the collective direction, and further promoted the revolutionary competition of collective heroism.
    In order to strengthen the trade union work and realize the Party's leadership over the trade union, the Party must also educate Party members and Communist Youth League members to respond to the call of the trade union, take the lead in implementing the resolutions of the trade union, and play an exemplary role in various activities of the trade union. This experience was proved by the experience of the 53rd Factory early on, and a certain system was established. Every weekend, the Party's group meeting has a content to check the implementation of Party members' personal plans, carry out criticism and self-criticism. Then, at the trade union group meeting every Monday, Party members and League members lead the masses to check the implementation of the group convention of the previous week. In this way, the trade union work not only has the leadership of the Party committee's guidelines and policies, but also has Party members and League members as the backbone. When the Party checks the work of the Party branch in the workshop and the work of Party members and League members, it also takes ensuring the good work of the trade union as an important standard.
    This point has been experienced in many factories that have studied the experience of the 53rd Factory. Only when Party members and League members actively participate in the activities of the trade union can the trade union work be reliably guaranteed. However, doing so is difficult at the beginning. Hu Peiran, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Jiangnan Shipyard, said that when Party members do not understand the nature and tasks of the trade union, they often look down on the trade union organization and are unwilling to participate in the activities of the trade union. This emotion must be overcome. The Party must patiently explain to the Party members that the Party unites and educates the broad masses of workers through the trade union organization. Therefore, completing the call of the trade union is also implementing the task of the Party; if the trade union work is done well, the higher the prestige of the trade union, the more closely the Party can contact the masses; Party members also strengthen their contact with the masses in practice by actively participating in the trade union work and playing an exemplary role, and unite the broad masses around the Party through trade union activities.
    In order to ensure that the regular work of the trade union can be carried out in a planned manner, all after-work activities must be appropriately arranged under the unified leadership of the Party. At present, in the process of learning from the 53rd Factory, many trade union cadres in factories feel that: (1) If cultural learning and various after-work activities cannot be arranged in a unified manner, the daily work will be squeezed out when the central movement comes; (2) The time for Party and League activities cannot be reasonably allocated, and there is still a situation where the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League compete for after-work time. In particular, many places are affected by the dispersion of dormitories, and the difficulties are even greater. However, everyone believes that it is a very important experience for the Party of the 53rd Factory to appropriately arrange the time according to the entire work situation to ensure the trade union's activity time among the masses. The 53rd Factory stipulates that the time from 5 pm to 6 pm every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is the trade union's activity time, and the Party and League organizations guarantee that they will not occupy it, nor will they transfer Party members and League members to do other activities during the trade union's activity time. In this way, the trade union activities have Party members and League members as the backbone, and at the same time, it strengthens the Party's leadership over the actual work of the lower-level trade union. The cultural night school and the political common sense night school are separated and conducted after 6:30 after dinner, so that the movement time and the cultural learning time are separated, and the night school will not be squeezed out by the movement.
    How can the trade union obtain the leadership of the Party and strengthen its work? On this issue, Qi Tinghan, chairman of the trade union of the 53rd Factory, put forward their three points of experience: (1) The trade union must carry out its work under the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implement the Party's policies and implement the Party's resolutions, so that the trade union truly becomes the Party's guide to contacting the broad masses of workers; (2) The trade union must rely on Party members and League members as the backbone of the trade union work, and rely on the backbone to ensure the completion of the trade union's tasks; (3) The trade union must take the initiative to regularly report the work situation to the Party committee, reflect the ideological trends of the masses to the Party committee, and propose preliminary solutions. For example, in the trick-finding campaign in the 53rd Factory last year, it called for the promotion of the "trick courtyard" in the Second Workshop, but each workshop did not learn humbly, and created a variety of new and different things on their own. Some were called "trick palace" and some were called "trick hall." After the trade union reported this situation to the Party committee, the Party committee promptly convened a symposium, criticized the attitude of some cadres who did not humbly learn from the existing experience of others and attempted to do their own thing, and proposed to uniformly adopt forms that are easily accepted by the masses.
    The trade union's acceptance of the Party's leadership must also prevent two deviations. On the one hand, as Comrade Qi Tinghan, chairman of the trade union of the 53rd Factory, said, it cannot rely on the Party committee for everything, "give the child to his mother when he cries," and drag the Party into the circle of trivial affairs. The trade union must strive to give play to its own creativity and carry out its work independently. For example, when organizing labor competitions among workers, the trade union should promptly discover and conscientiously study all new advanced experiences and rationalization proposals, rely on the workers' class consciousness, and guide the workers' enthusiasm and wisdom into creative labor. In the past, in the 53rd Factory, there was also a purely task-oriented view. When the Party called for the development of rationalization proposals, the trade union also followed suit and issued general calls. As a result, the workers in one workshop submitted 93 rationalization proposals at once, but only 7 were adopted by the administration, of which only one played a role in production. This aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers and caused the trade union to be in a dilemma between the administration and the workers. Why are so many waste products generated in rationalization proposals? The reason is that there is no goal in advance. When the Party called for the development of rationalization proposals, the trade union did not study with the administration, seize the main key to solving the problem, and set topics for the problems to be solved, and carry out rationalization proposals in an organized, led, and purposeful manner. Therefore, the trade union should not simply act as a mouthpiece. It cannot do a good job if it simply echoes what the Party says and shouts without using its brain and issues general calls; but it should not follow behind the masses like a tail, but should correctly come up with ideas and think of ways to guide the workers and give play to their high wisdom to carry out the rationalization proposal campaign to solve the key problems in production.
    Another deviation is that the trade union deviates from the leadership of the Party, does not respect the leadership of the Party, and does its own thing. This is bound to make mistakes. Yang Yugen, chairman of the trade union of Shanghai Electric Power Company, criticized the previous practices of the second trade union committee of the factory. At that time, the trade union came forward for everything, and the plan was not submitted to the Party branch for discussion, so that in the minds of the masses, there was only the trade union and no Party. This blurred the masses' understanding and forgot that the workers' movement can only have unlimited development prospects under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    The experience of the trade union work of the 53rd Factory, as well as the experience of factories and mines that have achieved results in studying the 53rd Factory, have proved that: only under the leadership of the Party can the trade union work be continuously improved, be full of vitality, and closely unite the broad masses of workers around the Party to fight for the realization of the Party's call. When the whole country enters a new period of economic construction, we must conscientiously study the experience of the 53rd Factory, establish a normal order of grassroots work, strengthen the Party's leadership over the trade union work, implement the spirit of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and complete the historical task of national industrialization.

    工会是党联系群众的引带
    ——中国工会第七次全国代表大会专题访问
    本报记者　刘时平
    我国工人阶级在伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党领导下，正在大踏步地走上国家经济建设的新的历史时期。中国工会第七次全国代表大会在这时候召开，是有它的重大意义的。所有出席这次大会的代表们，听了刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央委员会对大会的祝词、刘宁一同志的开幕词和赖若愚同志的关于中国工会工作的报告，都更明确地认识到工会是党联系群众的引带。工会的作用，应该是“学习管理的学校，学习经营的学校，共产主义的学校”。正如少奇同志对大会的祝词中引证列宁所说的话，我们的工会必须能够真正成为“新生活的建设者”，成为“新的千百万人的教育者”。
    为了实现这个任务，摆在党和工会工作者面前的一个重要课题，是在厂矿中工会的基层组织中，加强党对工会的领导，不断提高工会工作水平，密切党和群众的联系。
    从个别访问中，从小组会上，我们经常可以听到来自各地的代表们提到学习五三工厂经验的情况，他们都从不同的角度来证明五三工厂的经验，是解决这个问题的榜样。
    五三工厂的工会工作在去年十二月二十四日已经受到中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会和中华全国总工会的奖励，同时，中华全国总工会发布了推广五三工厂工会工作经验的决定。目前全国各地的工矿企业中，有的正在准备推广五三工厂工会工作的经验，有的已经推行了五三工厂工会工作的经验，并且有了一定的收获。凡是认真学习了五三工厂经验的厂矿干部，都进一步体会到“五三工厂经验真能解决问题”。据江南造船厂党委副书记胡沛然、上海市政工会上海电力公司委员会主席杨馀根和浙江麻纺厂党委书记段克杰对记者说，五三工厂的经验，对他们完全可以适用。结合他们当前进行生产改革的工作，五三工厂工会工作的经验能够帮助他们克服工作中的盲目性，使他们明确认识党应该如何领导工会，工会如何在党的领导下，不断改进自己的工作，建立起基层工作的正常秩序，克服领导一般化和“一揽子”的领导方法。
    胡沛然同志说：在学习五三工厂经验以前，他们的工厂每逢党提出一个中心运动，如“三反”运动、民主改革、安全卫生大检查等运动，就由党、行政、工会和青年团的领导干部，组织一个临时的领导运动的委员会，统一领导。在那种组织形式下，由于干部的力量集中，步调一致，一般地说，都曾发挥了很大的作用。运动期间，工作紧张，群众也比较充分地发动起来。可是，运动一过，那个临时性的委员会就撤销了，运动也就跟着过去了，立刻就会使党委会感到失去了依靠，和群众失掉了联系，工作松劲，群众情绪冷落下去。现在和五三工厂的经验一对照，就很明显地可以看出，这是由于没有建立起党和工会的经常工作，没有在每个运动中，注意如何结合工会的日常工作，发挥工会的组织作用的结果。如果说，在过去进行一般政治性运动的时候，那样“一揽子”的领导方法，是有力的，能够发挥一定的作用，那末到了今天，当我们的国家已经开始新的经济建设工作的时候，那样“一揽子”的领导方法就不适用了。现在我们要进行生产改革，加强计划管理，实行经济核算，还有基本建设的任务，党为了保证与监督生产，任务是更加复杂和繁重了，需要更具体的、更细致的和更深入的领导。如果党委会的领导方法，仍停留在老一套的一揽子的搞“运动”的阶段，显然不能适应客观的需要。那样大包大揽的领导方法，不只是包办不了，也包办不好，必然会减弱党的政治思想领导，使党委会陷入事务主义的泥沼，反而削弱了党和工会的工作。
    段克杰同志进一步批判了过去“一揽子”的领导方法。浙江麻纺厂的工作是比较好的。但是段克杰同志说，他们厂的党委的领导工作，到现在还没有完全转变“一揽子”的领导方法。过去三年来，搞政治运动一直多于搞生产。每当一个中心运动来到的时候，党委就一把抓。在党委会上作出决定，就召开全厂职工大会，进行动员和布置。这样做法，虽能把中心任务一下子和群众直接见面，但是由于分工不清，责任不明，使各级工会干部都不知道自己该做什么。他们心里没有数，便无从主动地去开展工作，以发挥工会的组织作用。
    究竟应该怎样建立党对工会的经常的领导关系呢？沈阳冶炼厂党委书记魏文风说，在一九五二年秋季增产节约运动大检查以前，他们一直没有解决这个问题。党委对工会的领导，主要是吸收工会主席参加党委会议，临时碰到有什么事情，党委书记就找工会主席来个别谈谈。这就造成了工会依赖党委的现象，拨一拨，动一动。他们学习了五三工厂的经验之后，认识到那样做法，只是工会主席接受党委书记的领导，而不是党委会的集体领导。那样做，容易造成党的包办代替和工会主席对党委书记的依赖，而限制了工会在党的领导下，发挥组织作用。于是他们就决定要坚决按照党的组织原则，建立起工会中的党组，通过党组来实现党对工会的领导。这样做法，必须首先克服怕麻烦的思想。半年来的经验证明了，认真按照党的组织原则，通过工会中的党组来领导工会，像五三工厂的工会那样，在工会的党组会议上，认真按照党的指示，讨论各时期的工作计划、党的政策、政府法令、上级工会的指示，讨论某一时期工作中心、评选模范和奖励的原则、干部的培养调动、工会组织的改选等。讨论以后向党委提出，经党委同意，再由党组中工会委员提交工会委员会讨论，修正通过，作为工会决议，由工会具体组织群众去贯彻。这样做，就克服了过去党包办工会的老一套工作方法。
    当然，通过工会中的党组领导工会工作，并不等于减轻了党委会的领导责任。党委会还必须经常讨论工会工作。五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉对记者详细说明了他们的工会的做法。他们各时期的工作中心，都是紧紧地围绕着党为了保证和监督生产而提出的中心口号来进行的。党在每个时期，根据行政方面提出的生产任务，订出按年、按季、按月的保证计划，提出党的工作方针、原则、步骤、口号以及作法，也提出对工会的重点要求。如在推广先进经验工作中，党要求工会做好培养典型、树立旗帜、领导开展群众性的找窍门运动、推广先进经验。工会就根据党的要求，制订自己的计划。党委会不仅要讨论和审查党组提出的工会工作计划，并且要抓紧进行检查，发现工会工作中的问题，就及时帮助解决。比如他们在红旗竞赛中，曾一度推行了某厂“满堂红”和“蓝旗督促”的方法。这个方法，到了车间，被盲目地发展起来。在车间中挂起了花花绿绿的各种颜色的小旗，而且在旗上画的乱七八糟。一方面，小组和车间挂满了红旗，红旗丧失了通过先进带动落后的作用，另一方面，又由于插蓝旗的结果，却在工人群众中划出了先进和落后之间的鸿沟，插上蓝旗的工人就抬不起头来。党委发现了这种偏差，进行了讨论和检查，指出插蓝旗的办法是一种对落后群众打击和讽刺的形式，是削弱工人团结的错误方法。工会就又在工人群众中进行了教育，取消了插蓝旗的办法，并把红旗竞赛由个人的引向集体的方向，进一步发扬集体英雄主义的革命竞赛。
    为了加强工会工作，实现党对工会的领导，党还必须教育党员和青年团员，响应工会的号召，带头执行工会的决议，在工会的各种活动中，起模范作用。这个经验，早为五三工厂的经验所证明，并建立了一定的制度。每周末党的小组会有一项内容，就是检查党员个人计划的执行情况，开展批评和自我批评。然后在每星期一的工会小组会上，党团员就带动群众一起检查上周小组公约的执行情况。这样做，工会工作不但有了党委的方针政策的领导，并且有了党员和青年团员作骨干。党在检查车间党支部工作和党员团员的工作时，也以保证做好工会工作为一项重要标准。
    这一点，在许多学习五三工厂经验的工厂中，都有了同样的体会。只有党员和团员，积极参加工会的活动，工会工作才有可靠的保证。但是，这样做，开头是有困难的。江南造船厂党委副书记胡沛然同志说，在党员不了解工会的性质和任务的时候，他们往往瞧不起工会组织，不愿参加工会的活动，这种情绪必须克服。党要耐心地向党员讲清楚，党是通过工会组织，来团结和教育广大的工人群众的。因此，完成了工会的号召，也就是执行了党的任务；工会工作搞好了，工会的威信越高，党也就能更紧密地联系群众；党员通过积极参加工会工作，起模范作用，也就在实际上加强了和群众的联系，通过工会活动，把广大群众团结在党的周围。
    为了保证工会经常工作能够有计划地进行，一切业余活动，必须在党的统一领导下作适当的安排。目前在学习五三工厂的过程中，许多工厂的工会干部感觉到：（一）文化学习和各种业余活动如果不能作统一的安排，中心运动一来就会把日常工作挤掉；（二）党团活动时间还不能合理地进行分配，党、行政、工会和青年团还存在着互相争业余时间的情况。特别是有好多地方受到宿舍分散的影响，困难就更多。但是大家都认为五三工厂的党根据整个工作的情况，适当地排列时间，保证工会在群众中的活动时间，是非常重要的经验。五三工厂规定每星期一、二、三、四下午五点到六点为工会活动时间，党、团组织保证不予占用，也不在工会活动的时间内，抽调党员团员做其他活动。这样，工会活动就有了党员团员作骨干，同时也加强了党对下层工会实际工作的领导。把文化夜校和政治常识夜校分在晚饭后的六点半以后进行，这样把运动时间和文化学习时间分开，夜校就不会被运动挤掉。
    工会怎样能取得党的领导，加强自己的工作呢？在这个问题上，五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉提出了他们的三点经验：（一）工会必须在党的领导下进行工作，认真地贯彻党的政策和执行党的决议，使工会真正成为党联系广大工人群众的引带；（二）工会必须依靠党员和团员作为工会工作的骨干，依靠骨干，保证完成工会的任务；（三）工会必须主动地经常向党委汇报工作情况，向党委反映群众的思想动态，并提出初步解决的方案。如去年五三工厂在找窍门运动中，曾号召推广了二车间的“窍门大院”，但各车间不虚心学习，自己标新立异搞的五花八门，有的叫“窍门宫”，有的叫“窍门厅”。工会向党委反映了这个情况后，党委就及时召开了座谈会，批判了某些干部中不虚心学习别人已有的经验而企图单搞一套的态度，提出要统一采用为群众所易于接受的形式。
    工会接受党的领导，也要防止两种偏向。一方面正如五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉同志所说的，不能事事依赖党委，“孩子哭了抱给他娘”，把党拖到烦琐的事务圈子里去。工会必须努力发挥自己的创造性，独立地进行工作。比方在组织工人群众的劳动竞赛时，工会应该及时地发现和认真地研究一切新的先进的经验和合理化建议，依靠工人阶级的自觉性，把工人群众的积极性和智慧引导到创造性的劳动中去。过去在五三工厂，也曾经存在过单纯任务观点，当党号召开展合理化建议时，工会也就跟着发出一般化的号召，结果有一个车间的工人们一下子就提了九十三条合理化建议，但经行政采纳的只有七条，其中在生产上起了作用的只有一条。这就引起工人的不满，造成工会在行政和工人的相互关系中，两头为难。为什么在合理化建议中会产生那样多的废品呢？原因是事先没有目标。在党号召开展合理化建议时，工会没有和行政一起研究，抓住解决问题的主要关键，并针对要解决的问题，定出课题，有组织有领导有目的地去开展合理化建议。因此，工会不应该简单地起传声筒的作用。党说什么，自己不动脑筋就跟着叫喊什么，发出一般化的号召，这是做不好工作的；但也不该作群众的尾巴跟着后面跑，而应该正确地出主意想办法，引导工人群众，发挥高度智慧，为解决生产中的关键问题，开展合理化建议运动。
    另外一种偏向就是工会脱离党的领导，不尊重党的领导，自己搞一套。这是一定要犯错误的。上海电力公司工会主席杨馀根同志，曾批判了该厂第二届工会委员会以前的做法。那时候，事事都由工会出面，计划也不交党支部讨论，以致在群众心目中只有工会，没有党。这样就模糊了群众的认识，忘掉了工人运动只有在共产党的领导下，才有无限发展的前途。
    五三工厂工会工作的经验，以及学习五三工厂已有成绩的厂矿的经验，都证明了：只有在党的领导下，工会工作才能不断提高，生气勃勃，把广大工人群众紧密地团结在党的周围，为实现党的号召而奋斗。当全国进入经济建设新时期的时候，我们必须认真学习五三工厂的经验，建立基层工作正常秩序，加强党对工会工作的领导，贯彻中国工会第七次全国代表大会的精神，去完成国家工业化建设的历史任务。
