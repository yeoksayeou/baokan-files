Volunteer Army Pilots Han Decai and Zhang Niuke
Liu Dawei
Pilot Han Decai is only twenty years old this year, but the comrades in the team prefer to call him "Little Hero" or "Our Detachment's Kid."

Han Decai is indeed a brave pilot. When he was nineteen, he shot down two American jet fighters, and now he is a hero who has shot down five enemy planes.

Han Decai ended his life as a cowherd for a landlord at the age of sixteen and joined the revolution. At seventeen, he joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. After he became a formal pilot, if you asked him what he was happiest about and what he liked most, he would immediately tell you: "To shoot down more enemy planes, win glory for the motherland, and defend world peace!" However, he also had an urgent and sincere wish, which was: "Strive to be a glorious Communist Party member."

The Party and comrades, especially his close comrade-in-arms, flight leader Zhang Niuke, constantly educated and helped him realize this precious wish. Han Decai said that 1953 was a very happy year for him because he had already shot down five enemy planes, and most importantly, he had become a glorious Communist Party member.

That was one morning in March this year. He and his comrades squatted under the wings of the plane, smelling the fresh fragrance of spring grass sprouting. The red sun rose on the newly green hillside, and the early glow dyed the airport red.

The political commissar came over and shook Han Decai's hand tightly, saying:

"Congratulations, comrade!"

Han Decai thought to himself, why congratulations! I haven't shot down an enemy plane today. The political commissar said, "The Party has approved you as a glorious member of the Chinese Communist Party. Remember, from today onwards, you should fight in Korea like a Communist Party member."

"Yes, I will definitely fight in Korea like a Communist Party member."

Han Decai answered, turning his head away because he didn't want the political commissar to see the tears of joy and gratitude in his eyes. The sun reddened his turned face. He pushed back his flight cap with his hand, at a loss. The spring breeze blew the hair that peeked out from under his flight cap. He silently thought: I will definitely fight in Korea like a Communist Party member.

Two. Han Decai's ability to quickly move from a Youth League member to the glorious path of a Communist Party member is inseparable from the Party's education and help to him. The Party educated and helped Han Decai through Communist Party member Zhang Niuke, Han Decai's flight leader, raising his class consciousness.

Han Decai and Zhang Niuke have been flying wing-to-wing since they went abroad to fight in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and neither has left the other. In the air, their two planes moved freely, as if two wings had grown out of one plane. In battle, they always supported and covered each other. In peacetime, Zhang Niuke often pointed out Han Decai's shortcomings in tactical movements at briefing meetings. Sometimes the two argued fiercely. At this time, Zhang Niuke would calm down, and after the meeting, he and Han Decai would appear by the river or on the taxiway of the airport for individual talks, until Han Decai solved the problem ideologically. At the same time, Zhang Niuke often told Han Decai how to correct his shortcomings.

Zhang Niuke is an excellent Communist Party member with rich combat experience. He often powerfully educated Han Decai with his exemplary behavior as a Communist Party member in combat and daily life. Take the air battle on January 26 as an example:

Their pair of planes had already dispersed a pair of enemy planes. The enemy's flight leader fled, leaving the enemy's wingman under Zhang Niuke's belly, afraid to come out. Han Decai could see clearly from behind Zhang Niuke and immediately notified Zhang Niuke by radio:

"Three, the enemy plane is under your belly, pull the plane up and shoot it down! I'll cover you from behind!"

However, Zhang Niuke did not shoot down this enemy plane. Under the conditions that allowed, Zhang Niuke consciously ordered Han Decai:

"Little Han! I'll pull the plane up, and I'll cover you. You shoot down this enemy plane!"

"Yes, Four understands, will resolutely execute!"

Han Decai said as he pushed the nose of the plane and rushed over. At this time, the flight leader Zhang Niuke's plane was covering him in the sky. Han Decai rushed over while aiming. When the distance was about right, he fired his cannons and shot down the enemy plane.

In air combat, the main task of the wingman is to cover the flight leader's attack on the enemy plane. And in this battle, the flight leader Zhang Niuke's deed of not competing for credit, not抢战绩[unclear, but meaning not snatching achievements] and covering the wingman to shoot down the enemy plane deeply educated Han Decai.

In this battle, Han Decai further realized that what Zhang Niuke usually told him was correct: whether or not an enemy plane can be shot down in air combat is not a matter of one person, but mainly depends on the good cooperation between the flight leader and the wingman.

Since then, Han Decai has formed better air formations. In battle, he has never dropped out of the formation and always closely followed the flight leader Zhang Niuke. Now, they are both very satisfied with each other's cooperation and often say:

"The reason why I was able to shoot down five enemy planes in a short period of time is first and foremost due to my flight leader Zhang Niuke."

"As long as Han Decai is behind me to cover me, I will have no worries about attacking the enemy."

Three. In the days of battle, Han Decai also had a concrete learning object in his mind, that is, the Soviet air force hero Kozhedub. In addition to combat and briefings, Han Decai often held a book written by Kozhedub "Serving the Motherland." He wrote down Kozhedub's famous saying in the article "The Secret of Victory" in his diary:

"...The pilot's confidence in flight victory, a high degree of awareness of the war's purpose, and strict discipline..." Han Decai understood that these are the main reasons for winning in air combat. These words generated power in Han Decai and also brought him victory.

Once, their four planes and eight enemy planes fought in the sky at an altitude of eight thousand meters. Han Decai flew last, powerfully covering the flight leader's attack. When they bravely dispersed the enemy's formation, an enemy plane flew to his right front, lower than him. As long as he pushed the nose of the plane, he could shoot down this enemy plane. At this moment, Han Decai suddenly discovered that four enemy planes were flying behind the three planes in front of him, attempting to launch a sneak attack. He made a decisive decision, consciously giving up the prey he was about to capture to help his comrades. He turned the nose of the plane without hesitation and single-handedly intercepted the four attacking enemy planes. He drove the four enemy planes away in a panic and steadily aimed at an enemy plane on the right and fired. This enemy plane crashed down, smoking. He continued to pursue the other three, wanting to shoot them all down. At this moment, he discovered that an enemy plane was chasing one of our planes in the upper right, while another enemy plane was closely following our plane. He immediately thought of helping his comrades. So, he dropped the prey he was about to capture for the second time, pulled the control stick, and flew to the upper right, followed by a burst of fierce artillery fire, driving away the enemy plane tailing our plane. Then he chased this enemy plane relentlessly. The aiming reticle had tightly surrounded the enemy plane. At this moment, he instinctively remembered Kozhedub's experience on tactical maneuvers: "You need eyes in all directions, front, back, left, and right, on your head..." So, he looked back: an enemy plane was rushing towards him. He maneuvered into a rising sideslip, thinking, "Good boy, you still want to hit me, I won't let you off!" At this time, the enemy plane chasing him rushed to the front of him. This guy flew low to the sea. Han Decai closely逼着[pressuring] him from above. Han Decai said in his heart, "Good boy, rush, I'm following you anyway. Either you rush into the sea yourself, and I'll save some shells. Or you raise your head and take a burst of my cannon, make it quick!" Sure enough, as expected, the enemy plane wanted to rise not far away and was smashed to pieces by Han Decai's burst of cannon fire.

After the battle, everyone praised Han Decai for being brave and resourceful, and he himself said that this was mainly due to the good experience created by Kozhedub. The leadership pointed out that Han Decai's performance in shooting down two enemy planes due to helping his comrades was valuable. This is the quality that pilots should have. Han Decai's courageous and confident bold behavior should become the character that pilots should have.

In this way, the Party branch reviewed Han Decai's performance in work and combat for a long period of time, and after the introduction of Zhang Niuke and Li Juhang, Han Decai finally realized his great ambition and became a glorious Communist Party member.

Since then, Han Decai has been more active in his work and combat. In 1952, he shot down a total of two enemy planes; and in the spring of 1953, he shot down three enemy planes. Han Decai regarded these achievements as gifts to the Party and the people. He and his comrade-in-arms Zhang Niuke both believe that these achievements are only the beginning, because every Communist Party member requires himself to contribute more and more to the great cause of defending peace.

    志愿军飞行员韩德彩和张牛科
    刘大为
    一飞行员韩德彩今年已经二十岁了，可是队上的同志们都愿意用“小英雄”或“我们大队的孩子”这样的名称来称呼他。
    韩德彩确确实实是个勇敢的飞行员，他十九岁的时候，就击落了两架美国喷气式战斗机，而现在他已经是击落五架敌机的英雄了。
    韩德彩在十六岁那年结束了给地主放牛的生活，参加了革命，十七岁参加了中国新民主主义青年团。在他成为一个正式的飞行员之后，如果你问他，你最高兴和你最喜欢的事情是什么？他会马上告诉你：“更多的击落敌机，为祖国争光，保卫世界和平！”可是，他还有个急迫的诚挚的心愿，那就是：“争取作个光荣的共产党员。”
    党和同志们，尤其是他的亲密战友，长机飞行员张牛科不断地教育和帮助他实现了这个可贵的心愿。韩德彩说，一九五三年是他感到非常幸福的一年，因为他已经击落了五架敌机，而最重要的是他已成为光荣的共产党员了。
    那是今年三月里的一个早晨，他和他的战友们蹲在机翼下面闻着春天青草发芽的清香气息。红红的太阳升在披着新绿的小山坡上，早霞染红了机场。
    政治委员走来，他紧紧地握着韩德彩的手说：
    “祝贺你，同志！”
    韩德彩心里想，为什么祝贺呀！今天我还没打下敌机呢。政治委员说：“党已经批准你作为一个光荣的中国共产党党员，记住，从今天起你应该像一个共产党员那样的战斗在朝鲜。”
    “是，我一定像共产党员那样战斗在朝鲜。”
    韩德彩一面回答，一面转过头去，原因是他不愿让政治委员看见他那喜悦和感激的泪花。太阳映红了他转过去的脸，他不知所措地用手向后推了推飞行帽，春风吹着他那从飞行帽子底下显露出来的头发，他默默地想着：我一定像共产党员那样战斗在朝鲜。
    二韩德彩能够迅速地从一个青年团员走上共产党员的光荣道路，是和党对他的教育和帮助分不开的。党通过共产党员、韩德彩的长机飞行员张牛科教育和帮助韩德彩，提高了他的阶级觉悟。
    韩德彩和张牛科自从抗美援朝出国作战以来就在一起比翼飞行，谁也没离开过谁。在空中，他们两架飞机就好像一架飞机上生出双翼一般地动作自如。战斗里，他们总是互相支援，互相掩护。在平时，张牛科经常在讲评会上指出韩德彩在战术动作上的缺点。有时两个人也争论得很厉害。这时，张牛科就冷静下来，等散会以后，就和韩德彩出现在河边上或机场上的滑行道旁个别谈，一直到韩德彩从思想上解决了问题为止。同时张牛科还经常告诉韩德彩应该如何去纠正缺点。
    张牛科是个优秀的共产党员，有着丰富的战斗经验。他常常在战斗和日常生活中，用共产党员的模范行为有力地教育了韩德彩。就拿一月二十六日这次空战来看吧：
    他们一对飞机已经把敌人一对飞机冲散了。敌人的长机逃窜了，剩下了敌人的僚机在张牛科的肚子底下不敢出来。韩德彩在张牛科后面看得清清楚楚，马上用无线电通知张牛科：
    “三号，敌机在你肚子底下，你把飞机拉起来，把它打下去！我在后面掩护你！”
    可是张牛科没有打这架敌机，在这种情况允许的条件之下，张牛科有意识地这样命令韩德彩：
    “小韩！我把飞机拉起来，我掩护你，你把这架敌机打下去！”
    “是，四号明白，坚决执行！”
    韩德彩一面说着，一面推机头就冲过去了。这时，长机张牛科的飞机在上空掩护着他。韩德彩一面冲过去一面瞄准，距离差不多了，他猛开大炮，把敌机打下去了。
    在空战中僚机的主要任务是掩护长机向敌机攻击。而这次战斗中长机张牛科这种不争功，不抢战绩，掩护僚机击落敌机的事迹，深深地教育了韩德彩。
    韩德彩在这次战斗中进一步认识到张牛科平常对他所讲的话是正确的：在空战中能否打下敌机不是一个人的事情，而主要是长机和僚机配合得好。
    从此，韩德彩在空中编队编得更好了，在战斗中他一次也没掉过队，总是紧紧地跟着长机张牛科。现在，他俩都很满意对方的配合，常常这样说：
    “我所以能在很短的时间内打掉五架敌机，这首先应该归功于我的长机张牛科。”
    “只要有韩德彩在后面掩护我，我会没有任何顾虑的去攻击敌人。”
    三在战斗的日子里，韩德彩的心目中还有一个具体的学习对象，那就是苏联的空军英雄阔日杜布。除去战斗和讲评之外，韩德彩经常捧着阔日杜布著的一本书“为祖国服务”。他在日记本上记着阔日杜布“胜利的秘诀”一文中的名言：
    “……飞行员对于飞行胜利的信心，高度的战争目的的自觉，严格的纪律……”韩德彩明白，这些都是在空战中获得胜利的主要原因。这些话在韩德彩身上产生了力量，也给他带来了胜利。
    有一次，他们四架飞机和八架敌机在八千米的高空格斗，韩德彩飞在最后，有力地掩护着长机进攻。当他们勇敢地把敌机队形冲散了的时候，有一架敌机飞到他的右前方，高度比他低，只要他一推机头就可以把这架敌机打下来。正在这时，韩德彩突然发现上方有四架敌机正向他前面的三架飞机屁股后面飞去，企图进行偷袭。他当机立断，自觉地放弃快要捕捉到手的猎物去援助战友。他毫不犹豫地扭转机头，单枪匹马拦截四架偷袭的敌机。他把四架敌机打得狼狈逃走，并且稳稳地瞄准了右面的一架敌机开炮射击，这架敌机冒着烟栽下去了。他继续追逐着另外三架，要把它们都打掉。正在这时，他又发现右上方我方的一架飞机追逐着一架敌机，而另一架敌机却又紧跟着我方这架飞机。他马上想到援助战友，于是，又第二次丢掉自己即将捕捉到手的猎物，把操纵杆一拉向右上方飞去，紧接着一阵猛烈的炮火，将尾追我方飞机的敌机赶跑。接着他又尾追着这架敌机不放。瞄准光网已经紧紧地套住敌机了，这当儿，他本能地想起阔日杜布关于战术动作的经验来：“在你的头上需要前后左右都长眼……”于是，他回头向后一看：一架敌机正向自己冲来，他机动地来了个上升侧滑，心里想：“好小子，你还想打我，我非让你下去不可！”这时，追他的那架敌机冲到他的前面去了。这家伙低飞逃到海上，韩德彩在上面紧紧地逼着他。韩德彩心里说：“好小子，冲吧，反正我跟着你，要不，你就自己冲到大海里去，我节省下炮弹。要不，你就抬起头来挨我一顿大炮，来个痛快！”果然，不出所料，敌机飞不多远想抬头上升，被韩德彩一阵大炮打得粉碎。
    战后，大家赞扬韩德彩勇敢机智，而他自己说，这主要是阔日杜布创造的经验好。领导上提出韩德彩由于援助战友而击落了两架敌机的表现是可贵的，这是飞行员们应该有的品质。韩德彩这种有我无敌，充满勇气和信心的果敢行为，应该成为飞行员们应有的性格。
    就这样，党支部在较长期的审查了韩德彩工作战斗中的表现，又经过张牛科和李居杭的介绍，韩德彩终于实现了他伟大的志愿，成为一个光荣的共产党员。
    从此，韩德彩工作和战斗更积极了。一九五二年，他一共击落了两架敌机；而一九五三年的春季，他就击落了三架敌机。韩德彩把这些战绩当作对党对人民的献礼。他和他的战友张牛科都认为：这些战绩仅仅是个开始，因为，每一个共产党员都要求自己对保卫和平的伟大事业贡献得越多越大越好。
