    Capital's May Day Carnival Night
    On the night of the capital's "May Day" festival, everywhere was filled with cheers and songs, brimming with the joy of youth.
    The main streets were brightly lit. Theaters were crowded with audiences waiting to see the color film documenting the great communist construction project – the Lenin Canal. On the wide roads leading directly to Tiananmen Square, people thronged, cheering. The songs "Singing of the Motherland" and "People of the World are of One Heart" were broadcast from loudspeakers along the way. From far away, one could hear the sounds of joy from the crowds in Tiananmen Square.
    The Tiananmen Gate Tower was decorated with lights, shining brightly. Eight large red palace lanterns hung in the middle of the ochre-colored columns, solemn and majestic. The arrow tower opposite Tiananmen and the tall red walls on both sides of the square were fitted with lights, connected like pearls. Light beams from searchlights in all directions intersected high above the square. Fireworks burst in the blue sky, like a sudden rain, scattering countless colorful flowers.
    Tiananmen Square was a sea of people. People sang and danced to their hearts' content. Combat heroes from the frontline border posts in Korea and labor models from various production fronts of the motherland were warmly welcomed by the people. Everyone in the square was immersed in a sea of joy, singing and dancing for the strength of the motherland and their own happiness.
    The people of the capital revelled until late at night. (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都五一狂欢之夜
    首都“五一”节的夜晚，到处是欢呼和歌唱，充满了青春的欢乐。
    各个主要街道上，灯光灿烂。电影院前面挤满了观众，他们正等待着观看记录伟大的共产主义建设工程——列宁运河的彩色影片。在直通天安门广场的各条广阔的马路上，人们簇拥着，欢呼着。“歌唱祖国”、“全世界人民心一条”的歌曲从沿路的播音器中播送出来。人们从很远的地方，就可以听到天安门广场上人群的欢乐的声音。
    天安门城楼被灯光装饰得光辉灿烂。在赭色的圆柱中间，悬挂着八盏大红宫灯，庄严而雄伟。天安门对面的箭楼和广场两边高大的红墙顶上，都装着灯光，一个个地串连起来，像珍珠一样。从四面八方的探照灯里射出的光柱，在广场的高空交叉。礼花在蓝空中开放了，像一阵骤雨，无数鲜艳的花朵，撒坠下来。
    天安门广场上一片人海。人们尽情的歌舞着。来自朝鲜前线边防岗位上的战斗英雄们，祖国各个生产战线上的劳动模范们，受到人们的热烈欢迎。在广场上的每一个人，都沉浸在欢乐的海洋中，为祖国的强大和自己的幸福而歌舞。
    首都人民一直狂欢到深夜。　（新华社）
