Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 29th dispatch: The French National Assembly has refused to authorize Paul Reynaud, leader of the "Independent Republicans," to form a new cabinet. The government crisis, which has lasted for more than a week, continues.

    On the 27th, Reynaud did not consult with the leaders of various political groups as usual, but delivered a policy speech in the National Assembly, and demanded that the Assembly first agree to amend the constitution. In his speech, he talked about France's current dim financial and economic situation, saying: France is currently threatened by decline, and has made no achievements in reversing the crisis. Next year's budget deficit may rise from the current 730 billion francs to 1 trillion francs. Currency reserves are shockingly low. The value of the franc has lost nine-tenths. In agriculture and industry, exports are very weak, and production is far behind all European countries, especially West Germany. Reynaud said: France has become "the sick man of Europe," and the Korean War has not benefited it. But Reynaud said he wanted to continue to implement the anti-people policies that caused these ills, including continuing to follow the United States in diplomacy. He said:
    “My government will definitely keep France loyal to the Atlantic Alliance.”
    In order to continue these disastrous policies with less constraint, Reynaud demanded that the constitutional clauses be amended to stipulate that if the parliament causes a government crisis within 18 months after the establishment of a new government by rejecting confidence in the government, the parliament should be dissolved. If the parliament passes his amendment to the constitution, the government will have a means to coerce the parliament to approve its various demands.
    In the debate on Reynaud's speech in the National Assembly, Vadèque Rochet, the representative of the Communist Party parliamentary group, sharply criticized Reynaud's policy speech. Representatives of some right-wing parties also dared not express their approval because of the blatant anti-people nature of this policy speech. As a result of the vote, Reynaud did not get the required majority.

    法国政府危机在继续中
    【新华社二十九日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会拒绝授权“独立共和党”领袖保罗·雷诺组织新阁。延续了一个多星期的政府危机在继续中。
    二十七日，雷诺未按惯例与各政治集团首领协商，就在国民议会发表政策演说，并要求议会首先同意修改宪法。他在演说中谈到法国目前暗淡的财政经济情况说：目前法国遭到了没落的威胁，并且在挽回危局方面毫无成就。明年的预算赤字可能要从目前的七千三百亿法郎升到一万亿法郎。货币储备少得惊人。法郎的价值已经丧失了十分之九。在农业和工业方面，出口非常疲弱，而生产也远远落后于欧洲所有国家，特别是西德。雷诺说：法国已成为“欧洲的病夫”，朝鲜战争并没有使它得到好处。但是雷诺表示他想继续执行造成这些恶果的反人民的政策，包括在外交上继续追随美国。他说：
    “我的政府将肯定法国忠于大西洋联盟。”
    为了能继续这些祸国的政策而少受掣肘，雷诺要求修改宪法条款，规定如果议会在新政府成立后十八个月内因拒绝信任政府而使政府发生危机，议会就要解散。如果议会通过他的这一对于宪法的修正，政府便将有一种用来胁迫议会批准它的种种要求的手段。
    在国民议会对雷诺的演说展开的辩论中，共产党议会党团代表瓦德克·罗歇对雷诺的政策演说提出了尖锐的批评。一些右翼政党的代表也因这个政策演说的露骨的反人民的性质，而不敢表示赞成。表决结果，雷诺没有得到所需的多数票。
