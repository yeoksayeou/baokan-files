Prospecting for National Resources to Ensure Construction Needs
Central Geological Department's Geophysical Prospecting Teams Depart for Various Regions

The Geophysical Prospecting Teams of the Central Geological Department departed at the end of April for eleven key geological exploration areas in five major administrative regions across the country to carry out exploration work.

The scale of this prospecting force is unprecedented in our nation's history. They consist of over 200 technical personnel and trainees, along with over 200 workers, carrying over 200 sets of magnetic, resistivity, natural current prospecting, gravity, and other instruments, and thousands of tools. They will universally employ magnetic, resistivity, and natural current methods, simultaneously prospecting in non-ferrous metal regions. In the non-ferrous metal mines of the Helan Mountains in Ningxia, gravity methods will also be added, utilizing four methods for prospecting. Their annual workload will be approximately eighteen times that of last year. If this workload were calculated based on the scale and speed of work done annually in the ten-plus years before liberation, it would take approximately one hundred and fifty years to complete.

They are able to accept such a major task mainly because they conscientiously studied Vice Premier Chen Yun's instructions at last year's geological planning meeting, that "geological work must serve the needs of the state," and they have cultivated and increased their strength through various methods. For example, in magnetic prospecting, each instrument used to make an average of only fifty or sixty measuring points per day. After learning and summarizing advanced experience, they can now make three hundred to four hundred measuring points per day, making one instrument equivalent to five or six in the past.

In the past, only students graduating with a physics degree from universities or colleges were qualified to perform technical operations in geophysical prospecting. The geophysical prospecting team, in summarizing experience, analyzed and studied the process of geophysical prospecting work, believing that apart from the technical design at the beginning of the work and the final interpretation of results, the remaining work such as instrument operation and drawing could be done by people with a junior high school or higher elementary school level of education after short-term training. In this way, the team was expanded, resolving the difficulty of insufficient manpower. In a period of two weeks to a month, they trained over two hundred cadres with junior high school and higher elementary school educations, enabling them to learn the operational methods of one to three geophysical prospecting methods.

In addition, they overcame many difficulties in two months and prepared various sophisticated instruments and auxiliary tools. According to this year's situation, although the work of the geophysical prospecting team still has the contradiction of "large tasks" and "small forces," they are full of fighting confidence and have set off to the mountains and fields of the motherland to prospect for the resources of the motherland.

    勘探祖国资源保证建设需要
    中央地质部物理探矿队分赴各区进行工作
    中央地质部物理探矿队，已在四月底先后出发到全国五个大行政区的十一个重点地质勘查区，进行勘探工作。
    这一支勘探队伍的规模，在我国历史上是空前的。他们有二百多名技术人员、练习生，和二百多名工人，携带着二百多架磁力、电阻、自然电流探矿、重力等仪器，和数千件工具。他们将普遍采用磁法、电阻法和自然电流法三种方法，在有色金属地区同时探测。其中宁夏贺兰山区的有色金属矿，还准备加上重力法，用四种方法探测。他们全年的工作量，约为去年的十八倍。这个工作量若以解放前十余年来每年所做的规模和速度来计算，约需一百五十年才能作完。
    他们能够接受这样重大的任务，主要是认真学习了陈云副总理在去年地质计划会议上所提出的“地质工作要服从国家需要”的指示，用各种办法培养和增长了力量。如磁法探测，过去每架仪器一天平均只作五、六十个测点，他们经过学习和总结先进经验，现在每天可作三百个到四百个测点，这样一架仪器就顶过去的五、六架用。
    过去作物理探矿的技术操作工作的人，一定要大专学校物理系毕业的学生。物理探矿队在总结经验中，分析研究了物理探矿工作的过程，认为除去在工作开始的技术设计和最后解释结果的工作外，其余仪器操作、绘图等工作，具有中学或高小程度的经过短期训练后的人都可以做。这样，就扩大了队伍，解决了人力来源不足的困难问题。他们在两个星期到一个月的时间内，训练了二百多名具有初中和高小程度的干部，使他们初步学会了一种到三种物理探矿的操作方法。
    另外，他们在两个月中，克服了很多困难，准备了各种精细的仪器和附属工具。按今年情况，物理探矿队的工作虽然仍有“任务大”，“力量小”的矛盾，但他们充满了战斗的信心，出发到祖国的山林原野里，勘探祖国的资源。 （夏国治）
