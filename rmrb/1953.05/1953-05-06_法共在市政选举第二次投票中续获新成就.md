    Xinhua News Agency, May 5th dispatch from Paris according to TASS: On the 3rd, the second round of municipal elections was held in 18,000 French towns with populations under 9,000. This time it was conducted according to the majority representation system. Preliminary election results show that the French Communist Party has not only maintained its original position, but has also achieved considerable new successes. The Communist Party holds a majority in twenty-seven municipal councils. In some places, Communist and Socialist Party candidates jointly put forward candidate lists based on the minimum program proposed by the Communist Party. These candidate lists have achieved a majority in seventeen towns. On the one hand, the upper leadership authorities of the Socialist Party have tried their best to prevent the party's local organizations from forming alliances with the Communist Party's local organizations, while on the other hand, they have formed electoral groups with various reactionary parties.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris, "l'Humanité" published a statement by the French Communist Party on the municipal elections on April 28th. The statement pointed out: The municipal elections on April 26th demonstrated the Communist Party's great achievements, as it holds a leading position in many municipal councils and is the largest party in the country. This is the best response from the French working class and all the people to the ruling bloc's traitorous and war policies.
    The statement exposed the right-wing Socialist Party leaders' betrayal of the working class and their assistance to the ruling bloc, and called on ordinary Socialist Party members to act in unison with the Communists. The statement called on Communist Party local organizations to strive to reach agreements with Socialist Party grassroots organizations and jointly support those who are supported by the broadest electorate in the second election on May 3rd. The Communist Party put forward a minimum program for jointly formulating candidate lists with the Socialist Party, emphasizing a shift to a peaceful economy, a cessation of the war in Vietnam and wars in other countries, a rejection of the Bonn and Paris traitorous treaties, and the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

    法共在市政选举第二次投票中续获新成就
  　【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎四日讯：人口九千以下的一万八千个法国市镇在三日举行了市政选举第二次投票。这次是根据多数代表制进行的。选举初步结果表明：法国共产党不但保持了原有的地位，而且得到了相当大的新成就。共产党在二十七个市政委员会里占了多数。在一些地方，共产党和社会党候选人根据共产党所提出的最低纲领，共同提出候选名单。这些候选名单在十七个市镇里取得了多数。社会党上层领导当局一方面竭力阻止该党各地方组织和共产党地方组织结成联盟，另一方面却和各反动党派结成竞选集团。
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：“人道报”在四月二十八日刊登了法国共产党关于市政选举的声明。声明指出：四月二十六日市政选举显示出共产党的巨大成就，它在许多市政委员会里居于领导地位，它是全国第一大党。这就是法国工人阶级和全体人民对资产阶级统治集团的卖国和战争政策的最好回答。
    声明揭露了右翼社会党领袖出卖工人阶级、帮助统治集团的行径，并且号召社会党普通党员和共产党人一致行动。声明要求共产党各地方组织努力和社会党各基层组织取得协议，在五月三日举行第二次选举时共同支持那些受到最广大选民拥护的人。共产党提出了和社会党共同制订候选人名单的最低纲领，强调转向和平经济，停止越南战争以及在其他国家的战争，拒绝批准波恩和巴黎卖国条约，缔结五大国和平公约。
