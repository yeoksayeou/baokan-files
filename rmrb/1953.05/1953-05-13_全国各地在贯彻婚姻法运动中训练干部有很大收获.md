    Throughout the country, grassroots cadres and cadres of civil affairs and judicial departments at all levels have generally undergone training and learning in this year's Marriage Law implementation campaign, reviewing the implementation of the Marriage Law, thereby enhancing their understanding of the Marriage Law and enriching their work experience. This is a major gain of this year's Marriage Law implementation campaign.
    The way various localities trained grassroots cadres was through holding training classes or convening meetings of cadres at all levels, to educate the broad masses of cadres on the Marriage Law and the policies and principles of the Marriage Law implementation campaign. According to incomplete statistics based on materials received from 1,118 counties, 111 cities, 4 leagues, and 1 mining area, a total of 3,477,368 grassroots cadres (including county, district cadres, and main responsible cadres of townships and villages) were centrally trained nationwide. In addition, various localities also universally trained general cadres and mass activists in urban and rural grassroots organizations, and cadres working in various agencies, especially those in civil affairs and judicial departments, also universally studied the Marriage Law.
    After training and review, grassroots cadres in various localities criticized feudal residual ideas in dealing with marriage and family issues, and initially demarcated the boundaries between the new and old marriage systems. Many cadres who previously held erroneous understandings of or even resisted the Marriage Law, as well as those who were indifferent to the work of implementing the Marriage Law, have undergone great changes, and have begun to correctly understand the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and actively implement it. In Xiaoyue District, Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, among the 39 district cadres who participated in the study, 19 originally misunderstood the Marriage Law, 8 did not approve of the Marriage Law, and the rest were indifferent to the Marriage Law, but after the study, all 39 cadres unanimously expressed their support for the Marriage Law and its implementation in their work. In Tangxun Township, Mianyang County, Sichuan Province, more than 70% of the cadres actively led the movement after training. In Qinjia Gang Township in the suburbs of Chongqing, 150 trained cadres became the backbone of the Marriage Law implementation campaign. Many cadres have overcome the bureaucratic errors of the past in handling the marriage problems of the masses and strengthened their sense of responsibility. In Maoshan Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, a farmer, in order to interfere with the remarriage of his widowed daughter-in-law, deliberately killed his daughter-in-law and her lover. After the village cadres discovered this, they immediately educated the farmer and stopped the tragedy from happening in time. The secretary of the Hei Dian District People's Government in Xishui County, Hubei Province, used to procrastinate when handling marriage affairs for the masses. After this study, one day he received a request from a farmer in Jiangshan Township to mediate a divorce case, so he went barefoot in the rain overnight. Many district cadres in the county have changed their past attitude of pushing away the marriage disputes of the masses, and many farmers say: "The cadres have become better."
    After training, grassroots cadres in various localities rectified their policy thinking on the implementation of the Marriage Law campaign, overcame the impetuous mood that was common in the early stages of the campaign, as well as the subsequent slackening mood and the tendency to be restrained. In this way, the policy level and working ability of these cadres in handling the marriage problems of the masses have been improved to a certain extent, becoming a huge driving force in this Marriage Law implementation campaign. According to incomplete statistics from three special districts and two cities in Hebei Province, more than 300 model cadres emerged in this Marriage Law implementation campaign. In Mancheng County, more than 700 mass activists have been recruited as propagandists during the month of the campaign. In Minhou County, Fujian Province, learning tests were conducted among 102 district-level cadres, of which more than 85% could specifically answer questions about the policies and working methods of the Marriage Law implementation campaign. Among the street cadres in Wuhan, about 30% can now mediate marriage and family disputes among the masses reasonably and emotionally based on the principles of the Marriage Law. Many cadres feel that this study has increased their confidence in consistently implementing the Marriage Law in the future. Cadres at the Ningyuan Road Police Station in Yangpu District, Shanghai, had never studied the Marriage Law before. After this study, they all said: "In the future, when we encounter mass family disputes, we will have a better understanding of how to handle them."
    Cadres in the civil affairs and judicial departments who directly manage marriage affairs in various localities have also reviewed the implementation of the Marriage Law in the past during this study, and some improvements have begun to be made in their work. The Guangzhou Municipal and District People's Courts reviewed a total of 365 marriage cases during the campaign and reversed two wrongly judged cases. Cadres in the judicial and civil affairs departments of Shanghai reviewed their past erroneous attitudes of fearing trouble and shirking responsibility when handling marriage disputes among the masses, and criticized the past tendencies of unprincipled reconciliation and hasty divorce judgments that were common in handling marriage cases. After studying, cadres of the Beizhan District People's Court can generally grasp the spirit of the Marriage Law more correctly when handling marriage cases, and their work efficiency has also improved compared with the past. Cadres of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau reviewed the shortcomings of the complicated procedures for marriage registration in the past, and are now actively trying to correct them.
    The large-scale Marriage Law implementation campaign across the country has basically ended, but the work of implementing the Marriage Law must be carried out regularly for a long time. To this end, the people's governments and relevant departments leading the Marriage Law implementation campaign in various localities are summarizing the achievements and experiences of this campaign from the bottom up, and using this to conduct another education among cadres. At the same time, some civil affairs and judicial departments in charge of marriage affairs are also starting to cultivate and train a group of cadres and activists among the masses, so as to serve as the backbone for the regular implementation of the Marriage Law in the future.

### 全国各地在贯彻婚姻法运动中训练干部有很大收获

    全国各地在贯彻婚姻法运动中训练干部有很大收获
    全国各地基层干部和各级民政、司法部门的干部，在今年的贯彻婚姻法运动中，普遍经过一次训练和学习，检查了执行婚姻法的情况，从而提高了对婚姻法的认识，丰富了工作经验。这是今年贯彻婚姻法运动的一项重大收获。
    各地训练基层干部的方式是通过举办训练班或召开各级干部会议，向广大干部进行婚姻法和贯彻婚姻法运动的政策、方针的教育。根据目前已收到的一千一百一十八个县、一百一十一个市、四个盟、一个矿区的材料所作的不完全的统计，全国集中训练的基层干部（包括县、区干部及乡、村主要负责干部）共达三百四十七万七千三百六十八人。此外，各地还普训了城乡基层组织的一般干部和群众积极分子，各地机关工作干部，特别是民政、司法部门的干部，也普遍进行了婚姻法的学习。
    各地基层干部经过训练和检查后，批判了在对待婚姻问题和家庭问题上的封建残余思想，初步划清了新旧婚姻制度的界限。许多过去对婚姻法抱有错误认识甚至抵触情绪的干部以及对贯彻婚姻法工作表示漠不关心的干部，都有了很大的转变，开始能够正确了解婚姻法的基本精神，并积极执行婚姻法。浙江省上虞县小越区参加学习的三十九个区干部中，原先有十九人误解婚姻法，八人不赞成婚姻法，其余的对婚姻法漠不关心，但学习后，这三十九名干部一致表示拥护婚姻法并在工作中贯彻执行。四川省绵阳县塘汛乡干部经过训练后，积极领导运动的在百分之七十以上。重庆市郊覃家岗乡一百五十个经过训练的干部，都成为贯彻婚姻法运动的骨干。许多干部克服了以往在处理群众婚姻问题上的官僚主义的错误，加强了责任感。河北省满城县茂山村有个农民为干涉他的守寡的儿媳改嫁，蓄意杀害儿媳和她的爱人，村干部发现后立即向这个农民进行教育，及时制止了惨案的发生。湖北省浠水县黑店区人民政府的秘书，往日办理群众婚姻事务总是拖拖拉拉，这次学习后，有一天接到蒋山乡农民要求调解的一个离婚案件，他便连夜冒雨赤着脚去了。该县许多区干部都改变了以往对待群众婚姻纠纷一推了事的态度，很多农民都说：干部变好了。
    各地基层干部在经过训练后，端正了对贯彻婚姻法运动的政策思想，克服了运动初期普遍存在的急躁情绪，以及后来产生的松劲情绪和束手束脚的偏向。这样，就使这些干部在处理群众婚姻问题方面的政策水平和工作能力有了一定程度的提高，成为这次贯彻婚姻法运动中的巨大动力。据河北省三个专区两个市的不完全统计，在这次贯彻婚姻法运动中共出现了三百多名模范干部。满城县在运动月中，已有七百多名群众积极分子被吸收为宣传员。福建省闽侯县在一百零二个区级干部中进行了学习测验，其中百分之八十五以上都能具体解答有关贯彻婚姻法运动的政策和工作方法的问题。武汉市街道干部中，现在约有百分之三十能根据婚姻法的原则入情入理地调解群众的婚姻纠纷和家庭纠纷。不少干部都感到这次学习提高了他们今后经常贯彻婚姻法的信心。上海市杨浦区宁园路公安派出所的干部过去从未学习过婚姻法，这次学习后，都表示：以后碰到群众家庭纠纷，处理起来心中有数了。
    各地直接掌管婚姻事务的民政、司法部门的干部，在这次学习中，也都检查了过去执行婚姻法的情况，工作上开始有了若干改进。广州市和各区人民法院在运动中共检查了三百六十五件婚姻案件，并改判了两件错判的案件。上海市司法、民政干部检查了过去在处理群众婚姻纠纷时怕麻烦、互相推诿的错误态度，批判了过去处理婚姻案件中普遍存在的无原则劝和以及轻率判处离婚的偏向。北站区人民法院干部经过学习后，处理婚姻案件一般都能比较正确地掌握婚姻法的精神，工作效率也比过去提高了。上海市人民政府民政局的干部检查出过去办理结婚登记时手续繁多的缺点，现正积极设法纠正。
    现在全国大规模贯彻婚姻法的运动已经基本结束，但是贯彻婚姻法的工作还必须长期经常化地进行。为此，各地人民政府和领导贯彻婚姻法运动的有关部门，都正在由下而上地总结这次运动的成果和经验，并以此在干部中再进行一次教育。同时，若干主管婚姻事务的民政、司法部门也正在着手培养训练一批干部和群众中的积极分子，以便作为今后经常贯彻婚姻法的骨干。    （新华社）
