    [By our Newspaper] The First Ministry of Machine Building conducted another inspection of the construction and preparation work of basic construction projects from late April to mid-May. Based on the problems found during the inspection, it proposed methods for improving work, striving to complete this year's construction tasks on schedule.

    According to reports from seventy-one construction units, only 41% of the projects had started on schedule by April 20th. Construction organization designs, project budgets, and construction contracts were either not completed or agreements had not been reached, except for a few units. Particularly serious was the fact that major projects had not yet started. There were still many problems with various construction preparation works, such as design drawings, labor, and materials.

    The first problem in construction preparation work was that the design could not keep up with the construction. The design of the main metalworking workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant had not yet been completed, and the design of the woodworking and auxiliary workshops had not even started. The design of the iron casting workshop was originally scheduled to be completed by May 5th, but it was not completed until the 18th. At Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant, redesign was needed due to revisions to the product plan and the overly conservative indicators adopted in the original design. The main reasons for the delay in domestic design were the late determination of planned tasks and the untimely supply of design data. After foreign designs arrived, the translation, technical verification, and drafting capabilities could not keep up, preventing the drawings from being delivered to the construction units in a timely manner. For example, the construction drawings for Northeast Machinery Plant No. 1 had all arrived last year, but they could not be put into construction in a timely manner due to insufficient translation staff and other unprepared work.

    The second was the issue of equipment ordering and management. Most of the foreign equipment for the nine key projects had been ordered. The current problem is that non-standard equipment manufactured domestically based on drawings provided by foreign countries is difficult to order due to the large variety and small quantities. The equipment management system is quite chaotic. For example, of the 271 machines that had been transported to Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 4, 68 were not registered, 17 had rusted due to poor storage, 6 were deformed, and 12 were so damaged that they could not be used.

    The third was the issue of materials. Due to the untimely design, material specifications were submitted late, and some steel had not yet been ordered. For example, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant could not submit material specifications because the design of the main workshops had not been completed, and it is now short more than 3,000 tons of steel.

    The fourth was the issue of labor. The total number of workers is sufficient, but the quality is not high. Riveters and welders, plumbers, etc. are very scarce. Northeast Machinery Plant No. 1 currently has 85 workers, 35 of whom are the least skilled carpenters, tilers, and diggers; Shenyang Installation Engineering Company has 419 workers, none of whom are first or second grade (Note: First-grade workers in the Northeast have the highest skills) fitters or electricians; none of the workers at the Pneumatic Tool Plant are first-grade workers.

    The fifth is that the construction organization and plans of the various engineering companies have not been properly prepared. The construction organization of Northeast Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant had not been formally established by mid-April. The dormitory project of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant had all the drawings, materials, and labor ready long ago, but it had not yet started construction by mid-May because the construction organization design and construction progress had not been properly prepared. The engineering department of Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 4 has an unsound organization, and no one inspects the materials after they arrive at the plant.

    The sixth is that leading cadres of basic construction units generally neglect construction work. Most factory leaders believe that since the project has been contracted to the construction unit, the construction unit should be responsible for whether the task is completed or not. The seriousness of the problem can be seen from the situation of the following key construction plants. Northeast Machinery Plant No. 1 has four factory directors and deputy factory directors, and at one time none of them was specifically responsible for basic construction; the factory director of Northeast Machinery Plant No. 2 once said: "We pay the money and don't care about anything else"; basic construction is the main task of Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant and Pneumatic Tool Plant, but the factory directors are not responsible for basic construction work; Northeast Electrical Engineering Plant No. 4 has a heavy construction task this year, but the factory director only uses one-third of his energy on basic construction work. At the same time, after the First Ministry of Machine Building appropriately reduced the basic construction plan tasks in March based on the actual situation, the blindly aggressive thinking of some leading cadres of construction units was not completely overcome, and they showed a slack and passive tendency. Under the influence of this wrong thinking, some units have a phenomenon of mutual buck-passing in the relationship between Party A and Party B. For example, for the civil engineering construction project of Northeast Machinery Plant No. 1, the First Ministry of Machine Building, in view of the weak leadership of the engineering company responsible for the construction, decided to hand over the organization of the construction site to the unified leadership of Machinery Plant No. 1. Before the engineering company had prepared a specific handover plan, it immediately handed over, trying to push the responsibility away, and also transferred back the personnel working in Machinery Plant No. 1, causing ideological confusion among the cadres and workers below. Machinery Plant No. 1 did not actively transfer personnel from the production side to strengthen the construction site organization, but simply relied on the engineering company and required the engineering company to equip the personnel completely, otherwise it would not accept the task of leading the construction site. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building convened a meeting for this purpose and proposed solutions to the problem, but Machinery Plant No. 1 and the engineering company pushed each other back and forth, delaying for more than 20 days, causing the construction site to be in a state of chaos for a long time.

    In order to solve the problems in the construction preparation work, the First Ministry of Machine Building decided to first strengthen the regular ideological leadership of the factories. When Minister Huang Jing went to the Northeast to inspect work in late April, in addition to specifically helping the factories solve problems, he severely criticized the neglect of basic construction work and the passive thinking at the factory director's meeting convened in Shenyang. Minister Huang Jing also instructed that factories with heavy construction tasks must be led by the factory director specially responsible for basic construction; other factories with construction tasks should also have a deputy factory director specially responsible for basic construction. The Ministry also decided to conduct regular in-depth inspections of the work of the factories in order to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Secondly, for some units where the cadre strength of both Party A and Party B is weak, in order to facilitate the completion of tasks, Party B will be placed under the unified leadership of the Construction Committee. Factory 652, Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Northeast Machinery Plant No. 1, etc. have all done this. Facts have proved that this measure is conducive to early construction. For example, after Factory 652 and Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant did this, both parties concentrated their efforts and completed the preparation work such as project budget and construction organization design ahead of schedule. At the same time, the Ministry and Bureau transferred forces to strengthen those weak units. Thirdly, the existing technical forces should be quickly organized to do a good job in project budgeting, construction organization design, and site layout. Projects that are already in a condition to start construction must be started in a timely manner, so as not to squeeze many projects into the third quarter or cause rush work in winter, which will affect the quality of the project and labor safety. Fourthly, each construction unit should carry out a responsibility system movement at the end of May and the beginning of June to clarify the division of labor, clarify the scope of responsibility, overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and ensure the quality of the project. Finally, inspect the work of the design department, use realistic materials to conduct political and ideological education for the designers, and improve the design work.

    第一机械工业部争取按期完成建设任务
    再次检查基本建设施工准备工作
    【本报讯】第一机械工业部从四月下旬到五月中旬，又检查了一次基本建设工程施工及准备工作的情况，并根据检查发现的问题，提出了改进工作的办法，争取按期完成今年的建设任务。
    据七十一个建设单位报告，一般工程到四月二十日止，只有百分之四十一的工程按计划开工，施工组织设计、工程预算、施工合同等，除少数单位外，都没有做好或没有达成协议。特别严重的是主要工程都未开工。各项施工准备工作，如设计图纸、劳动力、材料等都还有不少的问题。
    施工准备工作中的第一个问题，就是设计赶不上施工。太原重型机器厂的主要工程金工车间的设计尚未做好，木模、辅助车间的设计还未进行，铸铁车间的设计原定五月五日全部完成，但到十八日才完成。抚顺机电厂，由于产品方案的修改以及原设计所采用的指标太保守，需要重新设计。造成国内设计迟缓的主要原因是计划任务确定太晚和设计资料供应不及时。国外设计到达后，翻译、技术核对、描图力量不能配合，致使图纸不能及时地交给施工单位施工。如东北机械一厂的施工图纸在去年就已全部到达，只因翻译人员不够以及其他准备工作未搞好，而不能及时施工。
    第二是设备订购和管理问题。九大重点工程的大部分国外设备已订到。现在的问题是：国外供给图纸国内制造的非标准设备，因品种多、数量少，不易订到。设备管理制度相当混乱。如东北电工四厂已运到厂的二百七十一台机器，其中有六十八台没有登记，因保管不善生了锈的有十七台，变了形的有六台，已损坏到不能使用的有十二台。
    第三是材料问题。由于设计不及时，材料规格提出得晚，有些钢材还没有订到。如太原重型机器厂因主要车间的设计没有做出来，没法提出材料规格，现在还差三千多吨钢材。
    第四是劳动力问题。工人的总数量已够，但质量不高，铆焊工、水暖工等都很缺乏。东北机械一厂现有八十五个工人，其中有三十五个是技术最差的木瓦工和挖土工；沈阳安装工程公司有四百一十九个工人，其中没有一个是一级或二级（按：东北一级工人技术最高）的钳工和电工；风动工具厂的工人，其中也没有一个一级工人。
    第五是各工程公司的施工组织及计划都没有做好。东北量具刃具厂的施工组织机构到四月中旬还未正式组成。太原重型机器厂的宿舍工程的图纸、材料、劳动力都早已齐全，只因没有做好施工组织设计及施工进度，到五月中旬还未开工。东北电工四厂工程处组织不健全，有些材料到厂后无人验收。
    第六是基本建设单位的领导干部忽视建设工作的现象相当普遍。大部分厂的领导干部都认为工程已包给施工单位，任务完成与否就应由施工单位负责。从下面几个重点建设厂的情况来看，便知道问题的严重性。东北机械一厂有四个正副厂长，曾一度没有一个专门负责基本建设的；东北机械二厂厂长曾说：“我们出钱，别的不管”；量具刃具厂、风动工具厂的主要任务是基本建设，但正厂长不负责基本建设工作；东北电工四厂今年的施工任务很重，而正厂长只有三分之一的力量用在基本建设工作方面。同时，第一机械工业部在三月份根据实际情况适当地削减了基本建设计划任务后，有些建设单位的领导干部的盲目冒进思想没有彻底克服，而表现了松懈消极倾向。在这种错误思想的影响下，有些单位在甲、乙双方的关系上就有互相推诿的现象。如东北机械一厂的土木建筑工程，第一机械工业部鉴于负责施工的工程公司的领导力量薄弱，决定把工地的组织交给机械一厂统一领导。工程公司在没有作好具体交接方案之前，就立即交代，企图把责任推出去了事，并且又把在机械一厂工作的人员调回来，引起下面干部、工人思想混乱。而机械一厂则不积极从生产方面抽调人员充实工地组织机构，单纯依赖工程公司，要求工程公司把人员配备齐全，否则就不接受领导工地的任务。中共沈阳市委和第
    一机械工业部东北办事处为此召集了会议，提出解决问题的方法，但机械一厂和工程公司却推来推去，拖了二十几天，使工地长期陷于无人负责的混乱状态。
    为了解决施工准备工作中的问题，第一机械工业部决定首先加强对各厂的经常的思想领导。黄敬部长在四月下旬去东北检查工作时，除具体帮助各厂解决问题外，曾在沈阳召集的厂长会议上，对那种忽视基本建设工作及消极的思想给以严厉的批判，黄敬部长并指示建设任务重的厂必须由正厂长专门领导基本建设；其他有建设任务的厂，也应有一位副厂长专门领导基本建设。该部并决定经常深入检查各厂的工作，以便及时地发现与解决问题。其次，对于某些甲、乙双方干部力量都薄弱的单位，为了便于完成任务，将乙方划归建厂委员会统一领导。现在六五二厂、量具刃具厂、东北机械一厂等都这样做了。事实证明这种措施是有利于提前施工的。如六五二厂、量具刃具厂这样做了以后，双方集中使用力量，提前完成了工程预算、施工组织设计等项准备工作。同时，由部、局调集力量充实那些力量薄弱的单位。其三，迅速组织现有的技术力量，做好工程预算、施工组织设计和场地布置工作。已有条件开工的工程必须及时开工，以免把许多工程都挤到第三季去完成或造成冬季抢工，而影响工程质量与劳动安全。其四，各施工单位在五月末六月初开展一次责任制运动，明确分工，划清责任范围，克服无人负责现象，保证工程质量。最后，检查设计部门工作，以现实的材料对设计人员进行政治思想教育，改进设计工作。
