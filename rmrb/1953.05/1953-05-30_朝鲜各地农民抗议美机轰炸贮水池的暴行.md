Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 29th – Farmers in various parts of the Korean rear are holding rallies to protest the US Air Force's atrocious bombing of Korean reservoirs, and to express the determination of Korean farmers to persevere in the struggle without yielding. Farmers in a village in Sunchon County, South Pyongan Province, held a protest rally on the 24th. Many people rushed to the stage to denounce the crimes. Some elderly people who had lost their children due to the enemy-created floods broke down in tears while speaking. Farmer Park Chun-kwan said: "No matter how insane the enemy is, they cannot thwart our determination to fight. We must always remember this blood debt, work hard to support the front lines, and severely strike the despicable enemy." The farmers participating in the rally were in a highly emotional state, and shouts of protest resounded throughout the venue. A village in the Pyongyang area that suffered damage due to the US aircraft bombing of the Gyeonryong Reservoir also held a protest rally on the 20th. Peasant woman Kim Geun-ha said indignantly at the meeting: "We must transform our anger into strength and immediately replant the seeds of revenge on our disaster-stricken land." Her call was unanimously echoed by all the farmers present. Protest rallies in various places have passed protest letters demanding that the United States Air Force be stopped from committing such inhuman and criminal acts.
