Xinhua News Agency, New York: The International Rubber Study Group recently held another meeting in Copenhagen. This group has held many meetings in the past. The sharp contradictions between rubber-producing countries and rubber-consuming countries have been exposed at these meetings, so none of the meetings have had any concrete results.

The struggle at the various meetings reflects the struggle in the world rubber market, mainly the struggle between British and American monopoly capitalists. This situation can be seen from the following facts: British monopoly capitalists are the largest rubber suppliers, controlling about half of the world's total rubber production, while American monopoly capitalists are the largest consumers, purchasing about half of the world's total rubber production.

British monopoly capitalists have used their superior position in the world rubber market to raise the price of rubber exports and earn huge profits. According to the British magazine "The Economist," British companies earned a total of $1.55 billion from the sale of rubber in the six years from 1946 to 1951.

After the end of World War II, American monopoly capitalists launched a strong attack on Britain's position in the rubber trade. In the first half of 1948, they forced British companies to lower rubber prices. Rubber prices continued to fall in the following years, only rising temporarily after the United States launched the Korean War in 1950 and capitalist countries carried out large-scale arms expansion, due to American stockpiling of strategic materials. However, this price increase was only a flash in the pan. After American monopoly capitalists stockpiled a large amount of rubber worth $3.3 billion in 1951, they began to put pressure on Britain to force them to make concessions.

Under the pressure of American monopoly capitalists, the International Materials Conference was established, which American newspapers called the State Department's super cartel. Through this super cartel, the United States gained control of the world market for copper, tungsten, cobalt, and other important raw materials, and drove down the prices of these raw materials.

However, British companies used various excuses to refuse to hand over the tin and rubber markets to the control of the International Materials Conference. In order to break the resistance of British rubber companies, the United States reduced its rubber purchases and drastically reduced its consumption of natural rubber. According to "Commerce Daily" statistics, in 1951, the United States' consumption of natural rubber was almost halved. American monopoly capitalists also stepped up the development of the synthetic rubber industry. By the end of 1951, the United States had used synthetic rubber to meet 75% of its rubber needs. The price of natural rubber immediately gradually fell. By the end of 1951, the price of natural rubber had fallen by almost 50%.

American monopoly capitalists, holding a large amount of rubber, were in an advantageous position to force British companies to accept their terms. In the US-UK agreement to trade 23,000 tons of rubber concluded in January 1952, the price was set by the United States. The US Senate Committee said with satisfaction in its report that this agreement with Britain was a great economic victory for the United States.

After signing this agreement, American monopoly capitalists bought rubber from other rubber-producing countries in the same way, thus driving down the price of British rubber. The British "Financial Times" said angrily that the current rubber price is too low. The British "Observer" said that the prospect is: the profits from exporting rubber to the dollar area are likely to only decrease, not increase.

The ban on the export of Malayan rubber to the People's Republic of China, implemented in May 1951, was a severe blow to British companies, but it directly benefited American monopoly capitalists greatly. This ban reduced the customers of Malayan rubber, making Malaya's economy more dependent on American monopoly capitalists.

American monopoly capitalists, taking advantage of the British rubber companies' need for the American market, stopped buying and continued to drive down the price of rubber.

Malayan rubber exports have begun to decline significantly. Malayan rubber exports in 1951 were 12% lower than in 1950, and exports in 1952 decreased even more. Malayan rubber planters began to reduce rubber production. News of rubber producers going bankrupt was published extensively in the newspapers.

While depreciating the price of rubber, American monopoly capitalists actively infiltrated their forces into the economies of rubber-producing countries. According to British statistics, American investment in Malaya, the world's largest rubber-producing region, reached $467 million by the end of 1952, only slightly less than the British investment of $575 million.

British business people, seeing their position in the rubber and other raw material markets threatened, were greatly panicked. There is currently an opinion brewing among these people, which is to sign long-term agreements for raw material transactions at the current prices to ensure that they can avoid being subjected to the arbitrary actions of American purchasing agencies.

Generally speaking, American companies are not opposed to concluding such agreements to stabilize the price of rubber and other raw materials, but there is one condition, that is: Britain must agree to sign an agreement to import wheat and cotton at prices set by the United States.

At the International Rubber Study Group meeting and during the visit of British officials to the United States, the long-term negotiations between British and American representatives have proved fruitless. Commenting on the results of these negotiations, the British "Financial Times" wrote that attempts to reach an agreement on the rubber issue failed in the initial stages, because producers and consumers could not reach an agreement each time they talked about setting a minimum price in such a long-term agreement.

    美英垄断资本在橡胶市场上的斗争尖锐化
    “国际橡胶研究小组”会议美英代表进行谈判毫无结果
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：国际橡胶研究小组最近又在哥本哈根举行会议。这个小组过去已举行过许多次会议。在这些会议上暴露了橡胶生产国家和橡胶消费国家之间的尖锐矛盾，因此，没有一次会议有任何具体的结果。
    各次会议上的斗争反映出世界橡胶市场上的斗争，主要是英国和美国垄断资本家间的斗争。这种情况可从下面的事实看出来：英国垄断资本家是最大的橡胶供应者，控制了约世界橡胶总产量的一半，而美国垄断资本家是最大的消费者，购买了约世界橡胶总产量的一半。
    英国垄断资本家利用他们在世界橡胶市场上的优越地位，提高了橡胶出口的价格，赚得了巨额的利润。据英国“经济学家”杂志说，英国公司从一九四六年到一九五一年的六年中，在出售橡胶上共赚得十五亿五千万美元。
    在第二次世界大战结束以后，美国垄断资本家向英国在橡胶贸易中的地位发动了强力的进攻。他们在一九四八年上半年迫使英国公司减低橡胶价格。橡胶价格在以后的几年中继续减低，只是在美国在一九五○年发动朝鲜战争和资本主义国家进行大规模扩张军备以后，由于美国囤积战略原料，橡胶价格一度上涨。但是，这种涨价只是昙花一现。美国垄断资本家在一九五一年囤积了价值三十三亿美元的大量橡胶以后，他们就开始向英国行施压力，迫使英国让步。
    在美国垄断资本家的压力下，国际原料分配会议成立了，美国报纸把这称为美国国务院的超级卡特尔。美国通过这个超级卡特尔，取得了对于铜、钨、钴和其他重要原料的世界市场的控制权，并压低这些原料的价格。
    但是，英国公司利用各种借口，拒绝把锡和橡胶市场移交给国际原料分配会议控制。美国为了要击破英国橡胶公司的抵抗，就减少了橡胶采购量，并剧烈减少了它的天然橡胶消费量。据“商务日报”的统计，在一九五一年，美国的天然橡胶消费量几乎减少了一半。美国垄断资本家并且加紧发展人造橡胶工业。到一九五一年年底，美国已经用人造橡胶满足了百分之七十五的橡胶需要量。天然橡胶的价格立即逐步下跌。到一九五一年年底，天然橡胶价格下跌了几乎百分之五十。
    美国垄断资本家在握有大批橡胶后，便处于有利地位，强迫英国公司接受他们的条件。在一九五二年一月美国和英国缔结二万三千吨橡胶交易协定中，价格就是由美国方面规定的。美国参议院委员会在报告中满意地说，这个与英国签订的协定是美国在经济上的一个巨大胜利。
    美国垄断资本家在签订了这个协定之后，用同样办法向其他橡胶生产国家购买橡胶，这样，便压低了英国橡胶的价格。英国“金融时报”愤怒地说，目前的橡胶价格是太低了。英国“观察家”报说，前途是：向美元地区出口橡胶的利润很可能只会减少，不会增加。
    一九五一年五月实施禁止马来亚橡胶输至中华人民共和国的禁令，对英国公司的打击是很厉害的，但这却直接给予美国垄断资本家很大的好处。这个禁令减少了马来亚橡胶的主顾，使马来亚的经济更要依靠美国的垄断资本家。
    美国垄断资本家利用英国橡胶公司需要美国市场这个弱点，便停止购货，继续压低橡胶的价格。
    马来亚橡胶出口已开始大量减少了。一九五一年马来亚橡胶的出口比一九五零年少百分之十二，一九五二年的出口更加减少。马来亚种植橡胶者开始减少橡胶生产。报纸上大量刊载了橡胶生产者破产的消息。
    美国垄断资本家一面贬低橡胶价格，一面积极把他们的势力渗入橡胶生产国家的经济。据英国的统计数字，美国在世界生产橡胶最多的马来亚地区的投资在一九五二年年底时已达四亿六千七百万美元，仅比英国的投资数目五亿七千五百万美元少一些。
    英国工商界人士看到他们在橡胶及其他原料市场上的地位遭到威胁，因而大为恐慌。这些人士之间目前正在酝酿一种意见，就是按照目前的价格签订原料交易的长期协定，以保证他们能够避免遭受美国采购机关的专横手段。
    一般说来，美国公司并不反对缔结这种稳定橡胶与其他原料价格的协定，但是有一个条件，那就是：英国必须同意签订按照美国定出的价格输入小麦与棉花的协定。
    在国际橡胶研究小组会议上以及在英国官员访问美国期间，英国与美国代表进行的长期谈判已证明毫无结果。英国“金融时报”在评论这些谈判的结果时写道，要想在橡胶的问题上达成协议的企图在最初阶段就失败了，因为，在每次谈到这种长期协定中要确定一个最低价格时，生产者与消费者就不可能取得协议。
