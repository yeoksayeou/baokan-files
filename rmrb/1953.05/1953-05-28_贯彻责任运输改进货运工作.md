Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Implement Responsible Transportation to Improve Freight Work
    Editor's Note: Since January 1st of this year, the nation's railways have implemented responsible transportation. That is to say: once goods are entrusted to railway transportation, the consigning unit no longer needs to send escorts or prepare protective equipment; instead, the railway is responsible for transporting the goods safely and promptly to the destination and handing them over to the owner. This is one of the proactive measures taken by the People's Railway to adapt to the country's large-scale construction efforts. On the one hand, it can save manpower and resources for the country, allowing various economic departments and basic construction units to reduce the burden of transportation work and concentrate their efforts on business operations. On the other hand, it also plays a significant role in prompting railway units to improve freight work and leverage transportation capacity. However, according to feedback from our readers, due to shortcomings in the implementation of the system and the deployment of transportation protective equipment by some railway units, as well as a lack of a spirit of cherishing state assets and a serious and responsible work style among some railway employees, many accidents involving the loss and damage of goods have occurred during railway transportation. This not only causes losses to state property but also affects the credibility of the People's Railway work and the implementation of the responsible transportation system. Now we are publishing excerpts from some of the reader's letters in the following section, hoping that the relevant railway leadership units will use them as a basis to inspect and improve freight work.
    Some Stations Load and Unload Goods Carelessly
    Causing Consigning Units to Suffer Many Losses
    Liu Chuanben from the Changwei Prefectural Grain Bureau in Shandong Province writes: The implementation of responsible transportation by the national railways this year is very beneficial to improving railway transport capacity and also makes it convenient for consigning units. However, some stations are not responsible enough when transporting and unloading goods, causing consigning units to suffer unnecessary losses. For example, in April of this year, we transferred 8 million jin of seed grain from the Changwei Prefecture to Anhui Province, distributing it to Fuli Ji, Sucheng, Tianjia'an, and other places. The loading station was not careful enough when loading the cars, and most of the grain bags were torn open, with a lot of grain leaking into the cars and from the seams around the cars. When unloading at the destination station, grain was scattered all over the platform. Although some of it was swept up, it had been mixed with a large amount of sand and soil, requiring laborious sorting; and some of the grain was scattered into the turnouts, making it impossible to clean up. According to statistics from the Fuli Ji station, when unloading each railcar of grain (30 tons) at the station, approximately 500 jin were scattered on the ground; and more seriously, 660,000 jin of sorghum transferred from Fangzi Station in Shandong to the station suffered a loss of more than 8,000 jin.
    In addition, on April 22nd, six railcars of grain were sent from Fangzi Station
    (all 15 tons), of which railcar No. 1313 (containing 132 bags of grain) was inexplicably dropped along the way and left unattended. It was not until April 29th that this railcar was pulled to Fuli Ji station, and 90 bags of grain inside had been soaked by rain, with a small number already sprouting and deteriorating.
    Based on the above situation, I suggest that the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government seriously inspect the above problems, quickly improve them, and educate employees to genuinely cherish the people's property.
    Yanggao Station Shows a Serious
    Lack of Responsibility in Freight Work
    Readers Guo Yu and Ma Enshan write: Yanggao Station is irresponsible in its freight work, frequently making mistakes that cause significant losses to consigning units.
    In February of this year, the Datong Trust Company entrusted the Yanggao Supply and Marketing Cooperative to transport more than 600 jin of pig liver to the Beijing Chemical Factory. After weighing the pig liver, the station placed it in the warehouse and left it unattended for more than 20 days. Only after the cooperative protested did the station transport the pig liver, but the unloading location was changed to Qinghuayuan Station; and after the goods arrived at the station, the cargo owner was not immediately notified to pick up the goods. As a result of these delays, the pig liver spoiled, causing a loss of state property.
    In March of this year, the Yanggao County Grain Bureau transferred soybeans to Tianjin, originally planned for 90 tons (three railcars). The station blindly notified the Grain Bureau to increase the transport by nine tons. The Grain Bureau transported the nine tons of soybeans to the station, but as a result, the railcar was not able to hold the increased amount and three tons were left over. On March 11th, when the Grain Bureau transferred ten railcars of grain to the Northeast, the station omitted 25 bags during loading. When the Grain Bureau raised the issue, the station staff felt it was "no big deal." In April, the Jining Native Produce Company entrusted the station to transport four railcars of sesame seeds to Tianjin East Station, and the station wrote the wrong destination for one of the railcars. When the consigner discovered this and requested the station to correct it, the station actually told the consigner to contact Tianjin Station directly.
    In short, Yanggao Station has serious irresponsibility in implementing the responsible transportation system, causing many mistakes. We suggest that the Beijing Railway Administration promptly conduct an inspection and urge the station to improve its work.
    Certain Units Under the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    Frequently Experience Losses During Grain Transport
    Ji Guobin from the Xiaogan Prefectural Grain Bureau in Hubei Province writes: Grain entrusted to the railway for transportation by the grain bureaus of some counties in our region frequently experiences shortages. From March 4th to 12th, within nine days, the Wuchang County Grain Bureau alone lost 30 bags from seven railcars of grain transported from stations such as Tuditang, Shanpo, Zhifang, and Heshengqiao to Hankou; among them, one railcar of rice (railcar No. 51386) transported from Shanpo Station to Hankou on March 8th originally carried 370 bags, but only 357 bags were counted at Hankou, a shortage of 13 bags. In addition, similar accidents have occurred when the Puqi and other county grain bureaus entrusted the railway to transport grain. After the loss of grain accidents, the grain bureaus have requested compensation from the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, but the response from the bureau has been: "We will respond in two months." This affects our bureau's ability to process accounts in a timely manner. We not only hope that the Zhengzhou Railway Administration will promptly and reasonably resolve these issues, but also hope that the bureau will inspect and eliminate the chaotic phenomena in responsible transportation in order to prevent similar accidents from continuing to occur.
    Railway Units Should Prevent
    Abrasion Accidents When Transporting Cotton Cloth
    The Transportation Section of the China Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company, Handan Branch writes: After the national railways implemented responsible transportation, some stations have not truly taken responsibility, resulting in frequent accidents. From January to March, the cotton cloth entrusted to the railway for responsible transportation by our company experienced abrasion accidents seven or eight times due to the lack of proper protection by some railway units, damaging more than 30 pieces of cloth, with some pieces abraded by as many as 25 layers. Only a portion of these losses have been compensated by the railway bureau, and the remainder is being negotiated for settlement. But in any case, this is a loss of state assets and must not continue to occur. It is hoped that the railway department will strengthen the education of freight personnel to raise their awareness of cherishing state property; and prepare protective equipment when transporting cotton cloth (such as the hemp bags and pads that cargo owners used to prepare when self-transporting, which were placed in easily damaged areas of the railcar; experience has shown that this can greatly reduce losses during transportation), to ensure the safe transportation of goods.
    Two Bags of Peanuts Shipped from Zhengzhou
    Their Whereabouts Remained Unknown After More Than Ten Days
    A Hui Muslim farmer from Gansu Province writes: Last year, the crops in our area had a poor harvest, and production this spring is difficult. I transported some local products and medicinal materials that I dug out from the homes of relatives and friends and my own home to Zhengzhou, and sold them for 1 million yuan, planning to buy some cool mats in Hankou to bring back home, to earn some grain to get through "Ramadan." Before leaving Zhengzhou, I heard that the price of peanuts in Xinyang was higher than in Zhengzhou. So I bought two bags of peanuts in Zhengzhou with the money and took them to Xinyang to sell. On May 5th, I registered at the freight office of Zhengzhou Station, and on the 6th I got the ticket (transportation ticket number 016398), handed over the goods, and took the train to Xinyang that night. Zhengzhou Station told me:
    "At most three days, this batch of peanuts can be transported to Xinyang." But I waited in Xinyang for five or six days, and the goods still had not arrived. I went to the freight office of Xinyang Station to inquire. The office called Zhengzhou Station twice; the person who answered the phone at Zhengzhou Station said "check it out," but after waiting a day, there was no response. The Xinyang freight office sent a telegram to inquire again, and the next day received a reply saying: "The goods have been loaded onto a less-than-carload lot number train on the 7th and sent to Xinyang." The Xinyang freight office checked all the southbound freight train numbers, but this train number had neither arrived at nor passed through Xinyang Station. So, I was trapped in Xinyang, with little travel expenses, no relatives or friends, and only able to eat one meal and one bowl of rice soup a day. As of today (May 17th), the goods are still missing; and I have no money left, and I owe more than 100,000 yuan in room and board to the restaurant. Now the price of peanuts here has fallen again. Even if the goods are transported here, the money from the sale will only leave about 300,000 yuan after deducting room and board and commission fees, not even enough to recover the cost. How can I go home and explain this to my relatives and family? I ask the railway department to be responsible for helping me solve this problem.

### 贯彻责任运输改进货运工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    贯彻责任运输改进货运工作
    编者按：今年一月一日起，全国铁路实行了负责运输；就是说：货物一经交托铁路运输，托运单位就不必再派押送人员和准备防护设备，而由铁路负责把货物安全、及时地运到目的地交给货主。这是人民铁路为了适应国家大规模建设工作而采取的积极措施之一，一方面可以为国家节省人力物力，使各经济部门和基本建设单位减轻在运输工作中的负担而能集中力量进行业务工作；另一方面对促使铁路单位改进货运工作，发挥运输力量也有很大的作用。但是根据本报读者反映：目前因为某些铁路单位在执行制度和置用运输防护设备等方面有缺点，以及某些铁路职工爱护国家资财的精神和认真负责的工作作风不够，以致造成了不少铁路运输中货物丢失、损坏的事故。这不但使国家财产受到损失，并且影响了人民铁路工作的信誉和对运输负责制的贯彻。现在我们把读者来信选择一部分摘要发表于后，希望有关铁路领导单位据以检查、改进货运工作。
    有些车站装卸货物不小心
    使托运单位受到很多损失
    山东省昌潍专署粮食局刘传本来信：全国铁路在今年开始实行负责运输，这对提高铁路运输力有很大好处，同时也使托运单位感到方便。但是，有些车站在运输装卸货物时不够负责，致使托运单位遭到不应有的损失。如今年四月份我们昌潍专区调往安徽省的种籽粮八百万斤，分发符离集、宿城、田家庵等地。发货站装车时不够小心，大部分粮包口被摔破，很多粮食漏在车厢里，并从车厢四周缝口漏出。到站卸车时，粮食撒满站台，有一部分虽经扫起，但已掺进大量沙土，需要费工整理；还有一些粮食撒到道岔内，就无法清出。据符离集车站的统计，每车皮粮食（三十吨）在该站卸货时，撒在地下的一般要达五百市斤左右；而更严重的是，由山东坊子车站调往该站的高粱六十六万斤，竟亏耗八千余斤。
    另外，四月二十二日由坊子车站发出六车粮食
    （都是十五吨），其中一三一三号车皮（装粮一百三十二包）不知什么原因被中途甩下，也无人管理。到二十九日这个车皮才被拉到符离集车站，内有九十包粮食已被雨淋湿，少数已经生芽、变质。
    根据以上情况，我建议中央人民政府铁道部认真检查上述问题，迅速加以改进；并应教育员工切实爱护人民资财。
    阳高车站在货运工作中
    有严重不负责任的作风
    读者郭钰、马恩山来信：阳高车站对货运工作不负责任，经常发生错误，使托运单位受到很大损失。
    今年二月间，大同信托公司托阳高供销合作社给北京化学厂运猪肝六百多斤。车站将猪肝过秤后，就放到仓库里二十多天没有管。后经合作社方面提出抗议，车站才把这批猪肝运走，但把卸货地点改为清华园车站；而货物到达站后，又未立即通知货主取货。这样拖来拖去，猪肝变了质，国家财产因而受到损失。
    今年三月，阳高县粮食局往天津调运蚕豆，原计划为九十吨（三车）。车站盲目通知粮食局要增运九吨。粮食局把九吨蚕豆运到车站，结果车装不下又剩了三吨。三月十一日粮食局调往东北的十车粮食，车站装货时漏装了二十五袋。粮食局提出意见，车站工作人员还觉得“无所谓”。集宁土产公司在四月份托该站运往天津东站葫麻四车，该站把其中一车的到达地点错写了。托运者发觉后要求该站纠正，该站竟让托运者直接和天津站联系。
    总之，阳高车站在贯彻负责运输制中有严重的不负责任现象，造成很多错误。我们建议北京铁路管理局迅速进行检查，并督促该站改进工作。
    郑州铁路局所属某些单位
    运输粮食常有丢失现象
    湖北省孝感专区粮食局冀国宾来信：我区某些县粮食局委托铁路方面运输的粮食，经常发生短少现象。仅武昌县粮食局三月四日到十二日九天中从土地堂、山坡、纸坊、贺胜桥等车站运往汉口的七车粮食中，就短了三十包；其中三月八日由山坡车站运往汉口的一车稻谷（车号为五一三八六）原载量三百七十包，到汉口清点时，只有三百五十七包，竟短少了十三包。此外，蒲圻等县粮食局由铁路托运粮食时也有同类事故发生。丢粮事故发生后，各粮食局都请求郑州铁路管理局负责赔偿，该局的回答是：“两月以后才能答复。”这就影响我局账目不能及时处理。我们不仅希望郑州铁路管理局迅速合理处理这些问题，更希望该局检查并消除负责运输中的混乱现象，以杜绝类似事故继续发生。
    铁路单位运输纱布时
    应该防止磨损事故
    中国花纱布公司邯郸分公司运输股来信：在全国铁路实行负责运输后，还有某些车站没有真正负起责任，以致常常发生事故。从一月份到三月份，我公司委托铁路负责运输的纱布，就因为某些铁路单位没有很好加以保护而发生磨损事故七、八次，损坏的纱布共三十多件，有的布匹磨损达二十五层。这些损失只有一部分得到路局的赔偿，其余正在交涉处理。但是不管怎样，这总是国家资财的损失，不允许继续发生。希望铁道部门对货运人员加强教育，使他们提高爱护国家财产的观念；并且在运输纱布时准备保护设备（如过去货主自运时常准备一些麻袋垫子，垫在车箱内易损坏布匹的地方；经验证明，这可大大减少布匹在运输中的损失），以保证商品的安全运输。
    两包花生米由郑州起运
    过了十来天竟不知去向
    甘肃省一个回族农民来信：去年我们那里庄稼收成较差，今春生产困难，我便把亲友家里及自己家中挖出的一些土产、药材运到郑州，卖了一百万元钱，准备到汉口买些凉席子回家，赚下点粮食好度“斋月”。由郑州动身前，我听到信阳的花生米价钱要比郑州高些。我就把钱在郑州买了两包花生米，带到信阳去卖。五月五日到郑州车站货运室登记，六日起了票（运票号码为○一六三九八），把货交了，当晚自己乘车到信阳。郑州车站对我说：
    “最多三天，这批花生米就可运到信阳。”但我在信阳等了五六天，货还没有运到。我到信阳车站货运室去催问。该室给郑州站打了两次电话；郑州站接电话的人都说是“去查一下”，但等了一天也不回答。信阳货运室又发电报催问，第二天接到回电说：“该货已由某号整零车皮于七日载往信阳。”信阳货运室查遍南去货车编号，就没有这一号数的货车来到或通过信阳站。就这样，我被困在信阳，路费带得既少，又是举目无亲，每天只得吃一顿饭、一顿米汤度日。直到今天（五月十七日），货还没下落；而我已经一个钱也没有了，饭馆中已欠下膳宿费十余万元。现在这里的花生米又落了价，就是将货运到，卖的钱除去膳宿费及行佣，只能剩下三十万元左右了，连本也捞不回来。这使我怎样回家向亲友和家人交代呢？我要求铁道部门负责帮助我解决这个问题。
