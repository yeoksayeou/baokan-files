Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 5th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: Although Harrison nominated Pakistan yesterday as a neutral nation to take custody of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, he still refuses to transport these prisoners of war to neutral nations. This tactic of delaying negotiations obviously cannot ease the world's public condemnation of him.

Even the U.S. military radio station in Tokyo admitted that Harrison's nomination of Pakistan as a neutral nation was only to cover up his previously expressed remarks refusing to accept Asian nations as neutral nations and insulting Asian nations. The radio station broadcast on May 4th that Harrison's insulting remarks had "made Asian countries feel unhappy," and that he nominated Pakistan in order to "correct the impression that the Allied forces are firmly opposed to any Asian country as a neutral nation." Agence France-Presse reported from Tokyo on the 4th that Tokyo believes that Harrison's nomination of Pakistan as a neutral nation is not a concession because he "has not changed the attitude he took last week" regarding sending prisoners of war to neutral nations.

Up to now, Harrison has not been able to come up with any tenable reasons to oppose sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral nations. According to Agence France-Presse, even "Allied diplomats" in Tokyo believe that the "reasons" he put forward for not being able to transport prisoners of war to neutral countries "seem to be very inadequate." The vast majority of world public opinion recognizes that the Korean-Chinese side's proposal is completely reasonable. India's "Delhi Express" commented on May 4th that many United Nations member states support the Korean-Chinese plan, which advocates transporting prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral countries "to avoid further suspicion of the use of force or propaganda by either side." The "Delhi Express" said that the frequent bloody incidents in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps "seem to indicate that this claim by the Communist side should be accepted."

Harrison's attempt to obliterate the real issue of sending prisoners of war to neutral countries, which should be resolved first, by first resolving the issue of neutral nation nominations, clearly cannot prove that he has taken the necessary positive attitude towards the rapid realization of an armistice in Korea. The "Indian Times" said on May 2nd: "The Allied representative said that the Communist side's proposal was 'completely impractical' and then threatened to suspend negotiations unless the Communist side took a more positive attitude. This is indeed not an attitude to solve the problem."

### 美方拖延谈判的手段不能缓和舆论的谴责

    美方拖延谈判的手段不能缓和舆论的谴责
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者报道：哈利逊在昨天提名巴基斯坦为收管不直接遣返的战俘的中立国，但是仍然拒绝将这些战俘运到中立国去，这种拖延谈判的手段，显然并不能缓和世界舆论对他的谴责。
    连美国的东京军中电台也承认，哈利逊提名巴基斯坦为中立国，只是为了掩饰他曾经发表过的拒绝接受亚洲国家为中立国并侮辱亚洲国家的言论。这个电台在五月四日广播说，哈利逊的侮辱性的言论已经“使亚洲国家感到不快”，而现在他提名巴基斯坦，是为了要“纠正这样一种印象，就是认为联军断然反对任何亚洲国家为中立国”。法新社四日从东京报道说，东京方面认为，哈利逊提名巴基斯坦充当中立国，并不是什么让步，因为他对于把战俘送到中立国去这一点，“并没有改变他上星期所采取的态度”。
    到现在为止，哈利逊还没有提得出任何站得住脚的理由来反对将不直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去。他所提出的不能运送战俘到中立国家去的“理由”，据法新社报道说，连在东京的“联合国外交人士”也认为“似乎是很不充分的”。世界极大部分舆论公认，朝中方面的建议是完全合理的。印度的“德里快报”在五月四日发表评论说，许多联合国成员国都支持朝中方面的计划，这个计划主张把不直接遣返的战俘运到中立国去，“免得再怀疑任何一方使用武力或进行宣传”。“德里快报”说，美方战俘营里经常发生的流血事件，“似乎已经说明该接受共方的这种主张”。
    哈利逊企图以首先解决中立国提名的问题来抹煞真正应该首先解决的把战俘送到中立国去的问题，这显然并不能证明他对迅速实现朝鲜停战采取了应有的积极态度。“印度时报”在五月二日已经说过：“联军代表说共方建议是‘完全不切实际的’随后又扬言，除非共方采取更积极的态度，否则要停止谈判，这的确不是一种要解决问题的态度。”
