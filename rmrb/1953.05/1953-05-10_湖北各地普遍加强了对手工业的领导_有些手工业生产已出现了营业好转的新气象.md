    Hubei Province Generally Strengthens Leadership Over Handicraft Industry; Some Handicraft Production Shows New Signs of Improved Business
    Since the provincial handicraft representative conference was held, the urban work departments of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee, local committees, and county committees, as well as trade union organizations at all levels, have first organized cadres to conscientiously study the transmitted reports and documents of the provincial handicraft representative conference. Through reporting and analyzing the current situation of local handicraft industries, they criticized the thinking of cadres who neglected leadership over handicrafts and clarified the position and development prospects of handicrafts in the current national economy. After unifying the ideological understanding of leading cadres and general cadres, various counties and towns successively convened regional handicraft representative conferences or trade union member representative conferences of a similar nature. The five special districts of Jingzhou, Xiaogan, Yichang, Xiangyang, and Huanggang have already convened representative conferences in forty-five counties. The spirit of the provincial handicraft representative conference was implemented at the local representative conferences, and the ten agreements on relationships between teachers and apprentices, employers and employees, and labor and capital were studied and discussed. Yichang City, Zhongxiang County, Wuxue Town, and other places also formulated specific measures based on the spirit of the "Ten Agreements" in combination with specific circumstances. In addition, various localities have transferred a large number of cadres to focus on adjusting the relationships between teachers and apprentices, employers and employees, and labor and capital in key towns or key industries, to promote the better development of handicraft production. Under the leadership of the CPC Yichang Municipal Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Handicraft Trade Union, the Private Enterprise Party Committee, and other organizations transferred 19 cadres to form a working group, which first began investigating and implementing the resolutions of the provincial handicraft representative conference in eight industries, including hardware and bamboo-wood industries. The city has established a handicraft office.
    The implementation of the spirit of the provincial handicraft representative conference and the strengthening of leadership over handicraft industries in various regions has yielded good results. Many handicraft workers in various regions, after attending the handicraft representative conference, understood that handicrafts still have development prospects in the future, and understood the business policy of self-production and self-sales, and meeting the needs of urban and rural people. Their enthusiasm for management has been significantly improved. Many handicraft workers have expanded their business, increased apprentices, actively sought ways to overcome difficulties, and opened up sales channels according to the needs of rural production. For example, the iron industry in Gucheng Chengguan Town, Xiangyang Special District, originally had only 12 red furnaces, but now it has increased to 22, and the number of apprentices has increased from 5 to 17. Handicraft workers in Huangpi and Hanchuan Chengguan, seeing the development of production, have also increased more than 40 apprentices and temporary workers. Among the 16 iron handicraft households manufacturing agricultural tools in Xiaogan Chengguan, most have signed agreements on respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and united production after adjusting the relationship between teachers and apprentices. Zhan Tongmao Wood Shop in Yangluo Town, Xinzhou County, changed its business methods, and with the help of bank loans, focused on rural areas and made agricultural tools. In the past, the shop's monthly turnover was only one or two million yuan, but in March it increased to twelve million yuan, an increase of nearly ten times, and the number of workers and apprentices also increased several times. After the Jin Kou Town woodworking workshops in Wuchang County implemented the business policy of facing the countryside and self-production and self-sales, they actively strengthened contacts with farmers, and both parties signed purchase and sale contracts. Production has greatly improved and is very popular among farmers. The nearby He Ping and Fan Hu townships alone have ordered more than 300 pieces of agricultural tools, with a product value of approximately 18 million yuan. Thirteen woodworking households in the town have solved the difficulty of sales, and a new atmosphere of improved business in the off-season has emerged. The total turnover of the thirteen woodworking households in January, February and March last year was 18 million yuan, and the turnover in the same period this year increased to 66 million yuan, exceeding the same period last year by about 270%, and exceeding the peak season (April, May, June) turnover last year by more than one time.

    湖北各地普遍加强了对手工业的领导
    有些手工业生产已出现了营业好转的新气象
    湖北省各专区、县、市镇积极贯彻省手工业代表会议的精神，普遍加强了对手工业的领导，使各地某些手工业生产已趋好转。
    自省手工业代表会议开过以后，中共湖北各地委、县委的城市工作部和各级工会组织首先组织干部认真学习了省手工业代表会议的传达报告和文件，通过汇报和研究分析当地手工业目前情况，批判了干部中忽视手工业领导的思想，明确认识了手工业在当前国民经济中所占的地位和发展前途。从领导干部到一般干部思想认识统一之后，各县、市镇都相继召开了各地区的手工业代表会议或相同性质的工会会员代表会议等。荆州、孝感、宜昌、襄阳、黄冈等五个专区，已有四十五个县召开了代表会。各地代表会贯彻了省手工业代表会议的精神，并学习讨论了关于师徒、雇佣、劳资之间的十项协议，宜昌市和钟祥县、武穴镇等地，还根据“十项协议”的精神结合具体情况订出了具体办法。此外，各地抽调了大批干部在重点城镇或重点行业中，进行调整师徒、雇佣、劳资关系，以促进手工业生产更好地发展。宜昌市在中共市委领导下，由市总工会、手工业工会、私营企业党委等抽调十九个干部组成工作组，首先在五金、竹木业等八个行业中着手调查分批贯彻省手工业代表会议的决议。该市已成立了手工业办公室的机构。
    各地贯彻省手工业代表会议的精神，加强对手工业的领导，已收到良好的效果。各地有许多手工业者，在开过手工业代表会后，明白了手工业在今后仍有发展前途，明白了自产自销、面向城乡人民需要的经营方针，经营积极性已有显著提高。不少手工业者已根据农村生产需要，扩大营业、增收学徒，主动想办法克服困难，打开销路。如襄阳专区谷城城关镇的铁业，原来只有十二座红炉，现在已增加到二十二座红炉，学徒已由五人增加到十七人。黄陂和汉川城关的手工业者，看到生产有了发展，也增加了四十多个学徒和临时工人。孝感城关十六户制造农具的铁业手工业户中，经过调整师徒关系后，大多数都订立了尊师爱徒、团结生产的协议。新洲县阳逻镇詹同茂木店改变了经营方式，在银行贷款扶助下，面向农村、改做农具，过去该店每月营业额只有一二百万元，三月份增加到一千二百万元，提高了将近十倍，工人、学徒也增加了数倍。武昌县金口镇木作坊贯彻面向农村、自产自销的经营方针后，主动和农民加强联系，双方订立购销合同，生产大有好转，也很受农民欢迎，仅附近的和平、范湖两乡就先后订制了大小农具三百多件，产品价值约值一千八百万元。全镇十三户木业解决了销路困难，出现了淡季营业好转的新气象，去年一、二、三月份十三户木业总营业额是一千八百万元，今年同时期的营业额增加到六千六百万元，超过去年同期约百分之二百七十，超过去年旺季（四、五、六月）营业额一倍多。
