    Millions of Letters from the Motherland Inspire Us to Advance Towards Greater Victory
    Wang Ying, Political Commissar of a Certain Artillery Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    We have received millions of letters. Some of them came from the capital of the motherland, Beijing; some came from the distant frontiers of the motherland; some came from the factories and farms of the motherland. The writers included soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army standing on the defense line, workers, peasants, and students; friends from various ethnic groups, white-haired elderly people, and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves; as well as the fathers, mothers, wives, and fiancées of the volunteer soldiers. These letters brought us the boundless concern of the motherland and gave us lofty honor.
    We received a letter from Wang Zhensheng, a child from the staff and workers' elementary school of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. The letter read: "Dear Uncles: You are working hard! I have donated all the pocket money my mother gave me for candy to buy airplanes and cannons, and my mother also donated one hundred eggs. Please eliminate more American devils and protect our motherland and the children of Korea!" Attached to the letter were two blank sheets of paper with three words written on them: "Reply Paper." The artillerymen read this letter next to the cannons donated by the people of the motherland. They smiled and thought, as if they saw the expectant eyes of thousands of kind mothers in the motherland and a group of innocent and lovely children jumping and skipping with their schoolbags. When the artillerymen recalled the devastated towns and villages of Korea they had witnessed with their own eyes, and the tragic scene of Korean people supporting the old and carrying the young, they felt how closely their weapons were related to the people of the motherland and the people of Korea! The next day, the artillerymen destroyed an enemy tank on the Wenden Highway, burning three American devils to death inside the tank. At this time, they immediately used the reply paper sent by Wang Zhensheng to write back, describing the victory of this battle and writing at the end: "Dear Little Brother: We must respond to your lovely intentions with even greater victory!"
    Observer Qi Binggui is a young man from a student background who came to the Korean battlefield with enthusiasm. When he first arrived on the front line, he was a little timid, as if the enemy's shells were all flying specifically towards him. One day, he received a letter from his father, Qi Yucai, which said: "Every time you write, you ask how things are at home. You don't need to worry about these things. Chairman Mao cares about us every day. Are you at the heroic Shangganling? I urgently want to know your heroic fighting stories and news of your meritorious service..." Qi Binggui repeatedly read his father's letter, feeling very ashamed and uncomfortable. He took his father's letter to see the instructor and said: "I request the higher authorities to give me difficult tasks immediately so that I can perform meritorious service in battle for the peace of the motherland and the people of the world!"
    The mothers of Northeast China sent us letters denouncing the bloody crimes of the American bandits bombing Northeast China, and listed the names of those injured and killed, as well as the time and place of the bombings. They asked us, saying: "Children, avenge your parents!" Truck driver Chen Fuxiang received several such letters. He took these letters wherever he went. He said to his comrades: "With it, I have the greatest hatred for the enemy!" Chen Fuxiang kept the instructions of the mothers of the motherland firmly in mind. In eight months, the truck he drove safely traveled more than 5,000 kilometers, and he was honorably awarded a third-class merit. The love of the people of the motherland warms us and inspires us to establish merits for the motherland.
    Third-Class Merit recipient and artilleryman Huang Kefu, in an emergency, moved the gun position, carrying a gun body weighing more than 200 kilograms alone, braving enemy fire to climb hundreds of meters to the top of the mountain in 15 minutes, using the gun to fiercely bombard the enemy, cooperating with the infantry to annihilate an enemy company. In another battle, our assault troops were blocked by the firepower of two enemy heavy machine guns and could not advance. At this time, the platoon leader asked Huang Kefu: "Can you complete the task of destroying the enemy machine guns?" Huang Kefu immediately replied: "Platoon leader, the cannons donated by the people of the motherland are to be used at this time. I can complete this task!" Regardless of the enemy's shells exploding around him, he fired more than 20 shells in succession, destroying the enemy's two heavy machine guns, supporting the assault troops in annihilating more than 200 enemies.
    Among all the letters from the motherland, the ones that encourage us the most are those that reflect the motherland's implementation of the first Five-Year Plan. This letter says that a huge factory is about to be built; that letter says that a new mine has been discovered. Factories and farms, cities and villages—every corner of the motherland is building and advancing intensely. The soldiers fight more bravely to defend the peaceful construction of the motherland. From October of last year to April of this year, the First Company used the cannons donated by the people of the motherland to destroy and damage 25 enemy tanks, destroy two enemy howitzers, one anti-aircraft machine gun, and two ammunition depots, and repeatedly supported the infantry in completing the task of annihilating the enemy. The entire company was awarded a collective third-class merit. The artillerymen wrote in a reply letter to the people of the motherland: "We must win glory for the people of the motherland and respond to you with new victories. We will use the new-style cannons donated by the people of the motherland to make the deep mountains and narrow valleys of the Korean front a graveyard for the American invaders and their running dogs. The letters from the motherland inspire us to advance towards greater victory!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    千万封祖国来信鼓舞着我们向更大的胜利前进
    中国人民志愿军炮兵某部政治委员  王颖
    我们收到了千万封信。它们有的来自祖国的首都北京；有的来自祖国遥远的边疆；有的来自祖国的工厂和农庄。写信的人有站在国防线上的中国人民解放军战士、工人、农民和学生；有各兄弟民族的朋友、白发苍苍的老年人和戴着红领巾的少年儿童队员们；还有志愿军的父亲、母亲、妻子和未婚妻。这些来信带来了祖国对我们的无限关心，给了我们崇高的荣誉。
    我们收到了一封峰峰矿务局职工小学校王振生小朋友的来信，信上写道：“亲爱的叔叔：你们辛苦了！我把妈妈给我买糖果的零钱都捐献买飞机大炮了，妈妈也捐献了一百个鸡蛋。请叔叔多多消灭美国鬼子，保护我们祖国和朝鲜的小朋友们！”信里还附着两张空白信纸，上面写着三个字：“回信纸”。炮手们在祖国人民捐献的大炮旁边念着这封信，他们笑着、想着，好像看见了祖国千百个慈祥的母亲期望的眼睛和一群夹着小书包蹦蹦跳跳的天真可爱的孩子。当炮手们回忆起亲眼看到的朝鲜残破的城镇和乡村、朝鲜人民扶老携幼的悲惨情景时，他们感到自己手中的武器和祖国人民、朝鲜人民有着多么紧密的关联啊！第二天，炮手们在文登公路上击毁了敌人一辆坦克，把三个美国鬼子烧死在坦克里。这时他们立即用王振生小朋友寄来的回信纸写回信，信上写了他们这次战斗的胜利情形，最后写道：“亲爱的小弟弟：我们一定要以更大的胜利来回答你那可爱的心意！”
    观测员祁秉贵是学生出身的青年，一股热情来到朝鲜战场，初上阵，不免有点胆怯，好像敌人打的炮弹都是专向他飞来。一天，他收到父亲祁玉财的来信，信上说：“你每次来信都是问家中情形怎样，这些你不用管，毛主席天天都关心我们呢。你是不是在英雄的上甘岭呢？我迫切要知道你英勇战斗的故事和立功的消息……”祁秉贵反复阅读父亲的来信，他觉得非常惭愧和难受。他拿着父亲的信去见指导员说：“我要求上级马上给我艰巨的任务，让我在战斗中去为祖国和世界人民的和平事业立功！”
    东北的母亲们给我们来信控诉美国强盗轰炸东北的血海深仇，并且在信上列举出被炸伤亡的人名和被炸的时间和地点。她们要求我们说：“孩子们，为你们的父母报仇啊！”汽车司机陈福祥收到好几封这样的信。他走到那里就把这些信带到那里。他对战友们说：“有了它，我就有了对敌人最大的仇恨！”陈福祥牢记着祖国母亲们的嘱咐，在八个月中，他所驾驶的汽车安全行车五千公里以上，光荣地立了三等功。祖国人民对我们的热爱温暖着我们，鼓舞着我们去为祖国建立功勋。
    三等功臣、炮手黄克富在紧急关头移动炮位时，一个人扛着二百多斤重的炮身，冒着敌人的炮火在十五分钟内爬上数百公尺高的山顶，用炮猛烈轰击敌人，配合步兵歼灭敌人一个连。另一次战斗中，我军突击部队被阻在敌人两挺高射机枪的火力下不能前进。这时排长问黄克富：“你能完成打掉敌人机枪的任务吗？”黄克富立即回答说：“排长，祖国人民捐献的大炮就是在这时候用的。我能够完成这个任务！”他不顾敌人打来的炮弹在他周围爆炸，他连续发射了二十多发炮弹，击毁了敌人的两挺高射机枪，支援突击部队歼灭了二百多个敌人。
    在祖国所有的来信中，给我们鼓舞最大的是那些反映祖国实行第一个五年建设计划的来信。这封信中说有一个巨大的工厂将要建设起来了；那封信中又说发现了一个新矿山。工厂和农庄、城市和乡村——祖国的每一个角落都在紧张地建设着、前进着，战士们为了保卫祖国的和平建设而更加英勇地战斗。第一连在去年十月到今年四月间，用祖国人民捐献的大炮击毁、击伤了敌人坦克二十五辆、击毁敌人榴弹炮两门、高射机枪一挺、弹药库两座、并多次支援步兵完成歼敌任务，全连荣立集体三等功。炮手们在给祖国人民的回信里写道：“我们一定要为祖国人民争光，以新的胜利来回答你们。我们要用祖国人民捐献的新式大炮，使朝鲜前线的深山狭谷，成为美国强盗及其走狗的坟墓。祖国的来信鼓舞着我们向更大的胜利前进！”（新华社）
