Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, May 23rd: Government organs at all levels in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region conscientiously implement the central government's ethnic policies, value national forms, and have brought into play the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people in exercising their rights to regional autonomy.

    Since the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Region more than two years ago, a large number of leading figures connected with the Tibetan people and local ethnic cadres familiar with the lives and languages of the Tibetan people have been trained and absorbed to participate in the work of government organs at all levels in the autonomous region. Many of them hold leading positions, assisting the rapid development of various constructions in the autonomous region. However, in the past, governments at all levels in the autonomous region did not pay enough attention to national forms such as the Tibetan language, Tibetan script, and the living habits of the Tibetan people: for a long time, except for important official documents, only Chinese was used; for a period of time, Tibetan cadres at the autonomous region level ate from the same rice kitchen. These have damaged the enthusiasm of some Tibetan cadres and Tibetan people to fully exercise their rights as masters of their own affairs.

    Since the People's Government of the Autonomous Region formulated implementation measures for the development of national languages last year, all administrative and financial organs have replenished their translation cadres. The Autonomous Region Nationalities School has also specially set up national language classes. Han cadres at all levels in the Autonomous Region are learning Tibetan languages. All kinds of documents, proclamations, and propaganda materials are printed in both Tibetan and Chinese languages. Since February of this year, all official documents have been issued in both Tibetan and Chinese.

    Various meetings and government organ systems in the autonomous region have also generally adopted forms suitable to the situation of the Tibetan people. At the Third People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles in the Autonomous Region held last November, Tibetan representatives attending the meeting sat on Tibetan felt mats according to the original assembly form of the Tibetan people. Government organs have also specially set up office supplies and bedding that they are accustomed to for Tibetan cadres and religious figures working in the government, and have formulated work and living systems suitable for them. This has further increased the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people in their work, and the connection between Tibetan cadres and the government has become closer. Many Tibetan cadres who used to live at home have moved into the government and implemented a joint office system, collectively studying policies and discussing work.

### 西康藏族自治区各级政府重视民族形式

    西康藏族自治区各级政府重视民族形式
    【新华社雅安二十三日电】西康省藏族自治区各级政府机关认真执行中央民族政策，重视民族形式，发挥了藏族人民行使区域自治权利的积极性。
    藏族自治区成立两年多来，已经培养和吸收了大批与藏族人民有联系的领袖人物和熟悉藏族人民生活、语言的当地民族干部，参加自治区各级政府机关的工作，其中许多人担负着领导职务，协助了自治区各项建设的迅速发展。但是过去自治区各级政府对藏语、藏文和藏族人民生活习惯等民族形式还重视不够：较长时间内，除重要公文外，单用汉文行文；在自治区一级的藏族干部，有一个时期同吃大米灶。这些都曾经损害了部分藏族干部和藏族人民充分发挥当家作主的积极性。
    自去年自治区人民政府订出了发展民族语文的实施办法以后，各行政机关和财经机关，都充实了语文翻译干部，自治区民族学校并专门设立了民族语文班，自治区各级在职的汉族干部都学习藏族语文，各种文件、文告、宣传品，都以藏、汉两种文字印行，各种会议上也都使用本民族语文。今年二月开始，又将一切公文用藏、汉两种文字行文。
    自治区的各种会议和政府机关的各种制度，也普遍采取了适合藏族人民情况的形式。去年十一月举行的自治区第三届各族各界人民代表会议，就按照藏族人民原来的集会形式，参加会的藏族代表都去藏毡上席地而坐。政府机关还特别为藏族干部和在政府工作的宗教人士设置了他们习惯使用的办公用具、寝具，制订了适合他们的工作制度和生活制度。这样使得藏族人民工作积极性更加提高，藏族干部和政府的联系也更加密切起来。许多过去在家里住的藏族干部搬进了政府里住，并实行了联合办公制度，集体学习政策，讨论工作。
