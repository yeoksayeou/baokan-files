The CCP Changzhi District Committee of Shanxi Province Spring Ploughing Inspection Team, Wang Liangyu, Niu Xingjian, reported: After we arrived at Beishe Village, Licheng District, we saw that the masses' production enthusiasm was not high. Spring ploughing had begun, but the village's manure had not yet been delivered to the fields, and many people were crowded in the supply and marketing cooperative and small shops talking. Very few people were working in the fields. We conducted in-depth investigations and research and found that there was a serious problem in the mutual aid teams in this village, namely, the infringement of farmers' private property, which led to low production enthusiasm among the masses.

Last winter, when the Licheng County Committee was arranging this year's production tasks, it required each mutual aid team to have eight mu of collective high-yield land. In order to complete the tasks assigned by their superiors, the village cadres used a commandist approach, doubling the requirement for each team in the village to contribute 18 mu of collective high-yield land. The masses were dissatisfied with this approach, and the first plots contributed were all bad land. The cadres said, "No, the best land must be contributed." The masses then adopted a passive and resistant approach, still refusing to hand over the land. The cadres then adopted the method of holding continuous meetings to force the masses to contribute land. This one matter alone took more than three months of meetings. The masses were exhausted and had no choice but to reluctantly contribute the good land to the mutual aid teams. According to the statistics of seven mutual aid teams, a total of 176.3 mu of collective land owned by the mutual aid teams was contributed. Because the masses were unwilling, this land was distributed evenly according to labor. Thirty households had large plots of fertile land taken away, and in the future, they were compensated with smaller, poorer plots of land that were further away. Good land with a yield of sixteen shi was replaced with two small plots with a yield of twelve shi. As a result, this caused a major change in the land throughout the village. According to statistics, the land of 112 households, totaling 218.2 mu, was changed. This caused great ideological confusion among the masses. When the members of Song Jiangong's team discussed this issue, they said: From the beginning of the collective land, we knew that it wouldn't last long. This spring, one laborer contributed eight fen of good land, and after the wheat harvest, it will be another eight fen, and after the autumn harvest, it will be another eight fen, so that the land will gradually be collectivized. Under these circumstances, some people simply stopped working. Some people not only did not increase fertilizer, but also wanted to move the fertilizer that had already been applied to the land. The fertilizer for the collective high-yield land was distributed according to labor. Some teams had five dan, and some had ten dan. None of the team members were willing to take out good fertilizer to apply to the collective high-yield land. Therefore, the quality of fertilizer on the collective high-yield land was poor and the quantity was small, generally not as good as that of individual farmers. Dong Jianliang's team selected five mu of first-class good land as collective high-yield land, but only applied some pond mud. A lot of labor was used for the collective high-yield land, but the cultivation was very poor. Because the collective land was divided among the team members mainly based on labor under unwilling circumstances (60% for labor, 35% for land, and 5% for public accumulation fund), no one wanted to do it well, but they were also afraid of earning less if they worked less, so everyone went to the collective land. This not only failed to cultivate the collective land well, but also caused great losses to the individual land of the team members. Because they wasted too much time on the collective land, they delayed the processing of their individual land. If this situation continues, not only will there be no increase in production this year, but it will also lead to a reduction in production.

This phenomenon of forcing the masses to concentrate land to strive for high yields also exists in the villages around Beishe Village.

Based on the above situation, our inspection team, in addition to conscientiously implementing the policy of protecting farmers' land ownership and resolutely correcting deviations in Beishe Village, specifically conducted research on this issue with the Licheng County Committee. Now the County Committee has begun to correct this deviation. However, according to our understanding in some villages, this serious problem has not yet attracted the attention of the vast number of district and village cadres. We believe that the Licheng County Committee must further take effective measures to universally check and correct this deviation without affecting production. Otherwise, Licheng County's 1953 patriotic production increase task cannot be successfully completed.

    中共黎城县委盲目号召互助组抽积“集体丰产地”
    造成农民思想混乱影响今年粮食增产
    中共山西省长治地方委员会春耕检查队王良玉、牛星检报道：我们到达黎城一区北社村后，看到群众的生产情绪不高。春耕开始了，村里的粪还没送到地里，许多人拥在供销合作社和小铺里谈话，在地里劳动的人非常少。我们进行了深入的调查研究，发现这个村的互助组里存在着一个严重问题，即侵犯了农民的私有财产，因此群众生产情绪低落。
    去冬黎城县委在布置今年的生产任务时，曾要求每个互助组要有八亩集体丰产地。这个村的干部为了完成上级布置的任务，即以命令主义的方式，加倍地要求本村每组要抽集体丰产地十八亩。群众不满意这种作法，第一次抽的都是坏地。干部说：“不行，必须把最好的地抽出来。”群众就采取了消极对抗的办法，还是不把地交出来。干部就采取了连续开会的办法来强迫群众抽地。光这一件事就开了三个多月的会。群众疲劳不堪，最后只好无可奈何地把好地入了互助组。据七个互助组的统计，共抽出互助组公有集体地一百七十六亩三分。因为群众不自愿，这些地都是按劳力平均摊派的。有三十户被抽去大块的肥地，以后，补给他们的都是较坏的较远的小块土地。产量十六石的好地，补回的却是产量十二石的两块小地。这样做的结果，引起了全村的土地大变动。据统计，有一百一十二户的二百一十八亩二分土地变动了。这样一来，引起了群众思想上的极大混乱。宋建功组的组员们在讨论这一问题时说：从搞集体地开始，我们就看准了，反正没有几天过头了，今年春天一个劳动力入了八分好地，麦收后又是八分，秋后也得八分，这样就慢慢把土地归公了。在这种情况下，有的人就干脆不劳动了。有的人不仅不增加肥料，还想把已上到地里的肥料搬出来。集体丰产地的肥料是按劳力摊派的。有的组是五担，有的是十担。组员们谁也舍不得拿出好肥施到集体丰产地上。因此集体丰产地上的肥料质劣量少，一般的都比不上个体农民的。董建良组挑了五亩头等好地作集体丰产地，结果只上了一些塘泥土。集体丰产地用的工很多，但耕作得很坏。因为集体地是在组员不自愿的情况下以劳力为主分红（劳力分百分之六十、土地分百分之三十五、公积金百分之五），谁都无心把它搞好，但又怕作的少了分红少，所以要去集体地就大家都去了。这不仅不能种好集体地，就连组员个人的地也受了很大损失。因为在集体地上多误了工，就耽搁了个人土地的加工。这种情况如任其继续存在下去，今年不但不能增产，反而会造成减产。
    这种强迫群众集中土地争取丰产的现象在北社村周围的村子也同样存在。
    根据以上情况，我们检查队在北社村除认真贯彻保护农民土地所有权的政策，坚决纠正偏向外，特就此问题和黎城县委进行了研究。现在县委已开始纠正这一偏向。但据我们在一些村子里的了解，这一严重问题至今尚未引起广大区村干部的重视。我们认为黎城县委必须进一步采取有效措施，在不影响生产的原则下，普遍检查与纠正这一偏向。不然，黎城县一九五三年的爱国增产任务是不能胜利完成的。
