Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th - According to the American News Agency, the White House announced that Eisenhower has recommended Arthur W. Radford, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, to the Senate as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, succeeding Omar Bradley, who will step down in August.

Radford is one of the main proponents of Eisenhower's bankrupt "blockade" of China plan. Agence France-Presse reported that Eisenhower's decision to recommend Radford for the position of US military leader is a "recent friendly gesture" to a group of warmongers like MacArthur and Van Fleet.

In addition, Eisenhower also recommended Ridgway to succeed Collins as US Army Chief of Staff in August. Ridgway's current position as Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces will be taken over by his current Chief of Staff, Alfred M. Gruenther.

    美政府将调动若干军事首脑
    【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：据美国新闻处报道，白宫宣布，艾森豪威尔已向参议院推荐美太平洋舰队总司令阿瑟·吴·雷德福继将于八月卸任的欧默尔·布莱德雷为美国参谋长联席会议主席。
    雷德福是艾森豪威尔的破产了的“封锁”中国计划的主要鼓吹人之一。法新社消息说，艾森豪威尔决定推荐雷德福担任美国军事首脑职务，是对麦克阿瑟和范佛里特等一帮好战分子的一个“最近的友好姿态”。
    此外，艾森豪威尔还推荐了李奇微到八月时继柯林斯任美国陆军参谋长之职。李奇微现在担任的北大西洋公约军总司令职务将由他现在的参谋长艾尔弗雷德·马·格仑瑟接任。
