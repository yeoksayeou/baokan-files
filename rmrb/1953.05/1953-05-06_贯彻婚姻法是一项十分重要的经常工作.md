Implementing the Marriage Law is a Very Important and Regular Task

    During the Marriage Law Implementation Month, various regions across the country widely publicized the Marriage Law and inspected its implementation, achieving considerable success. In well-performing areas, cadres and the masses generally recognized the evils of the feudal marriage system characterized by coercion, arranged marriages, and male supremacy, as well as the merits of the new democratic marriage system based on freedom of marriage and gender equality. The broad masses also willingly acted in accordance with the Marriage Law, voluntarily resolving their family disputes, greatly boosting their enthusiasm for production. A new atmosphere of unity, harmony, joy, and enthusiastic labor emerged in many rural and urban families.
    However, we must not be satisfied with these achievements, because implementing the Marriage Law is a social reform aimed at opposing feudal remnants. This Marriage Law Implementation Month is only the beginning of this massive social reform. As pointed out in the Supplementary Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the work of the Marriage Law Implementation Month: "Lenin said, 'The force of habit of millions is the most terrible force.' Marriage and family issues involve every family and every individual. In this area, feudal ideas and feudal habits are deeply rooted in people's minds for thousands of years. This cannot be 'eliminated' in a short period using crude methods, but must be gradually cleared through continuous publicity and education work (including punishing a very small number of serious criminals) over a long period." Therefore, although this Marriage Law Implementation Month has ended, the work of implementing the Marriage Law must continue, and must be transformed into a very important and regular task.
    Implementing the Marriage Law must adhere to the policy of persuasion and education. Many experiences during this campaign month have proven this to be the most correct approach. As long as we persist in conducting publicity and education work for cadres and the masses, focusing on enlightening their consciousness, and making them truly appreciate the disadvantages of the old marriage system and the advantages of the new marriage system, they will automatically resolve those unreasonable phenomena brought about by the old marriage system, and will also automatically strive to implement the Marriage Law, safeguard freedom of marriage, and promote family harmony. The best way to persuade and educate the masses is to use vivid examples of real people and events, comparing good and bad, especially by having cadres and the masses who have already awakened use their own personal experiences of the pain of the old marriage system and the happiness of the new marriage system to provide firsthand accounts. In the future, in the continued implementation of the Marriage Law, we should further cultivate model couples and model families that have emerged during this campaign month. At the same time, organize them to publicize to the masses, or organize the surrounding masses to visit and learn from them. Only under the influence of one person teaching ten, and ten teaching a hundred, can we truly achieve the role of transforming customs. Many experiences have repeatedly proven that, especially in carrying out this work of opposing feudal ideas and habits among the peasant masses, we must never be impatient, and we must do long-term and patient work. In his political report at the Eleventh Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, Lenin said: "To unite with the peasant masses, that is, with the ordinary working peasants, and to begin to move forward, although the speed is slower than we would like to an immeasurable degree, to the extreme, but here the entire mass will truly advance with us." He also said: When every ordinary peasant truly realizes that we are helping him, that we are doing good for him, "he will follow us, even if this step is a hundred times slower, but it is a million times more solid." If we do not act solely on subjective enthusiasm, but act according to the actual situation, if we do not want to be divorced from the masses, but want the entire mass to truly advance with us, then we must adopt this method of steady advancement. Of course, this policy of adhering to education and steady advancement must not be misunderstood as meaning that we can let things drift. The above-mentioned serious cultivation of models and gradual expansion of the influence of models are precisely active actions.
    Implementing the Marriage Law must be closely integrated with production and construction. This is also a very important principle that has been proven by many experiences during this campaign month. Many work teams analyzed the production situation of those farmers and workers in rural areas and factories whose marriages were not free and whose families were not harmonious, and compared it with the production situation of farmers and workers whose marriages were free and whose families were harmonious. This made the masses truly realize how the feudal marriage system and feudal ideas and habits hinder production enthusiasm, and how they hinder our efforts to build happy families and a happy country. They more enthusiastically supported the Marriage Law and consciously implemented it. Their enthusiasm for production immediately increased, and the quality and quantity of production immediately improved. As the country begins to enter a new period of economic construction, mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in production and construction, giving full play to women's talents and wisdom, and expanding our ranks of industrial and agricultural production is one of the important conditions for completing and overfulfilling the national five-year construction plan. However, if we do not shatter the feudal marriage system that restricts women's participation in production and torments women's enthusiasm for production, and gradually eliminate the feudal ideas and habits left over by the feudal marriage system, the broad masses of women will not be able to participate in production freely and enthusiastically. Moreover, due to the harm of the feudal marriage system, many men are also disheartened to produce. Therefore, in future work of implementing the Marriage Law, we must often combine it with production, discover the different production situations of new and old marriages and new and old families, use concrete examples to conduct publicity and education to the masses, and resolve the marriage disputes of the masses based on the principles of freedom of marriage, family harmony, and development of production. Solving one case will push production forward a little bit, and will also expand the positive influence of implementing the Marriage Law a little bit.
    Those criminals who seriously violate the Marriage Law, causing personal injury and death, should still be severely punished according to the law, because this is no longer a simple matter of feudal ideas and feudal habits, but a matter of crime. If they are not severely punished according to the law, not only will the Marriage Law not be implemented, but other laws of our country will also not be implemented. Punishing a small number of serious offenders is also to educate the people, so that they know that the people's state safeguards the people's interests and protects the people's safety, and will never allow the barbaric acts of beating and killing people to continue to exist. Therefore, in the future, the handling of serious violations of the Marriage Law by governments at all levels should also be used as an opportunity to publicize and educate the masses, so that the masses consciously and automatically oppose this barbaric behavior, eliminate this barbaric behavior, and make it disappear forever.
    Finally, we must continue to educate district and township cadres, civil affairs cadres, and judicial cadres to resolutely act in accordance with the Marriage Law, and resolutely prevent cadres from violating the Marriage Law when handling marriage issues. In future marriage registration work, we must improve marriage registration institutions, strengthen leadership over marriage registration work, and the task of marriage registration institutions is to find out whether the marriage applicant conforms to the provisions of the Marriage Law. If they conform to the provisions, they should be registered; if they do not conform to the provisions, they should not be registered, and they should educate the masses who require marriage but do not conform to the provisions, so that they consciously abide by the Marriage Law. In future mediation of marriage disputes and trial of marriage cases, district and township cadres and judicial cadres must embody the spirit of the Marriage Law everywhere, must act in accordance with the Marriage Law, and use this correct handling to educate and improve the masses' understanding of the Marriage Law. For events in which cadres violate the Marriage Law in handling marriage issues of the masses in the future, party committees and governments at all levels must immediately correct them, criticize their feudal ideas, and use this as educational material for cadres. Those who are particularly serious should also be dealt with as violations of law and discipline.
    Since the work of implementing the Marriage Law is a very important and regular task related to national construction, party committees in various places should always attach importance to this work. At present, party committees in various places should specifically lead the Marriage Law Implementation Committees at all levels, earnestly summarize the experiences of this campaign month, formulate methods for regularly implementing the Marriage Law based on these experiences, and conduct special periodic inspections and research on this work to consolidate and expand the results of this Marriage Law Implementation Month.

### 贯彻婚姻法是一项十分重要的经常工作

    贯彻婚姻法是一项十分重要的经常工作
    在贯彻婚姻法运动月中，全国各地普遍地宣传婚姻法和检查婚姻法执行的情况，有了不少成绩。作得好的地区，干部和群众普遍认识了强迫包办、男尊女卑的封建主义婚姻制度的罪恶和婚姻自由、男女平等的新民主主义婚姻制度的美好，广大人民则亦自愿按照婚姻法办事，自动解决自己的家庭纠纷，大大鼓舞了人们的生产积极性，农村和城市的很多家庭里出现了团结、和睦、愉快和热情劳动的新气象。
    但是，我们决不能满足于这点成绩，因为贯彻婚姻法是一个反对封建残余的社会改革工作，这次贯彻婚姻法运动月，只是这一巨大的社会改革工作的开始。正如中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示中所指出：“列宁说，‘千百万人的习惯的势力乃是一种最可怕的势力。’婚姻和家庭的问题是牵涉到每个家庭每个人的问题，在这方面的封建思想和封建习惯，是几千年来根深蒂固地存在于人们思想意识中的一种东西。这是决不能在短时期内采用粗暴的办法去加以‘消灭’的，而必须是在很长时间内不断地进行宣传教育工作（包括惩处极少数严重犯罪分子）才能逐步地加以清除。”所以，这次贯彻婚姻法运动月虽然结束了，但是贯彻婚姻法的工作还必须继续进行，必须把贯彻婚姻法的工作变成一项十分重要的经常工作。
    贯彻婚姻法必须坚持说服教育的方针，这次运动月中很多经验都证明这是最正确的方针。只要坚持对干部和群众进行宣传教育工作，注重启发干部和群众的自觉，使他们真正体会到旧婚姻制度的坏处和新婚姻制度的好处，他们就会自动地来解决那些因为旧婚姻制度而带来的不合理现象，也就会自动地来为贯彻婚姻法、维护婚姻自由、家庭和睦而努力。向群众进行说服教育的最好的方法，是用活人活事、好坏对比的生动例子，特别是由已经觉悟了的干部和群众，用自己切身体会到的旧婚姻制度的痛苦和新婚姻制度的幸福来作现身说法。今后在继续贯彻婚姻法的工作中，应该进一步培养在这次运动月中出现的模范夫妻和模范家庭。同时组织他们去向群众宣传，或者组织周围群众去参观访问。在群众一传十、十传百的影响下，才能够真正达到移风易俗的作用。很多经验一再证明，特别是在农民群众中进行这种反对封建思想和习惯的工作，绝对不能性急，一定要作长期的耐心工作。列宁在苏联共产党第十一次代表大会上的政治报告中说：“与农民群众，即与普通的劳动农民结合起来，并开始向前移动，其速度虽比我们所希望的慢得不可计量，慢到了极点，但这里整个群众却真正会和我们一同前进。”他又说：当每个普通农民真正体会到我们是在帮助他、是在为他好的时候，“他就会跟着我们走去，就即令这种步度会要慢一百倍，但它却稳固牢实一百万倍。”我们如果不是只凭主观热情办事，而是要根据实际情况办事的话，如果我们不想脱离群众，而是要整个群众都真正和我们一同前进的话，我们就必须采取这种稳步前进的办法。当然，这种坚持教育、稳步前进的方针，决不能误解为我们可以放任自流，上面说的认真培养模范和逐步扩大模范的影响，正是积极的行动。
    贯彻婚姻法必须密切结合生产建设，这也是这次运动月中很多经验证明了的很重要的原则。很多工作组在农村和工厂分析了那些婚姻不自由、家庭不和睦的农民和工人的生产情况，对比着婚姻自由、家庭和睦的农民和工人的生产情况，就使群众真正认识封建的婚姻制度和封建的思想、习惯如何妨害生产热情、如何妨害我们建设幸福家庭和幸福国家的努力，他们就更热烈地拥护婚姻法，自觉地贯彻婚姻法，他们的生产热情立即增涨，生产的质量和数量立即提高。在国家开始进入新的经济建设时期，动员广大妇女参加生产建设，发挥妇女的才能和智慧，壮大我们工农业生产的队伍，是完成和超额完成国家五年建设计划的重要条件之一。但是如果不粉碎限制妇女参加生产、折磨妇女生产热情的封建婚姻制度，逐步肃清封建婚姻制度所遗留下来的封建思想和习惯，广大的妇女就不可能自由地热情地参加生产。而且由于封建婚姻制度的危害，也使很多男人无心生产。所以，在今后贯彻婚姻法工作中，就要经常地结合生产，发现新旧婚姻、新旧家庭的不同的生产情况，用具体事例向群众进行宣传教育，并根据婚姻自由、家庭和睦、发展生产的原则来解决群众的婚姻纠纷。解决一件，就把生产向前推进一点，也就把贯彻婚姻法的好影响扩大一点。
    对于那些严重违反婚姻法以致伤害人身、杀死人命的罪犯，仍然应该严肃地依法惩办，因为这已经不是简单的封建思想、封建习惯问题，而是犯罪问题。如果不严肃地依法惩办，不只是婚姻法不能贯彻，我们国家的其他法令也不能贯彻。惩办少数严重违法分子，也是为了教育人民群众，使他们知道人民的国家是维护人民利益、保护人民安全的，决不能容许那种打人杀人的野蛮行为继续存在。所以，各级政府今后对于严重违反婚姻法的犯罪行为的处理，也应作为宣传教育群众的一个机会，使群众自觉自动来反对这种野蛮行为，肃清这种野蛮行为，使它永远绝迹。
    最后，必须继续教育区乡干部、民政干部和司法干部，坚决按照婚姻法办事，坚决防止干部处理婚姻问题时违反婚姻法的行为。在今后的婚姻登记工作中，必须健全婚姻登记机构，必须加强对婚姻登记工作的领导，婚姻登记机构的任务就是查明结婚者是否合乎婚姻法规定，合规定的就给登记；不合规定的就不给登记，并且向不合规定要求结婚的群众进行教育，使他们自觉地遵守婚姻法。在今后的婚姻纠纷的调解中和婚姻案件的审判中，区乡干部和司法干部必须处处体现婚姻法的精神，必须按照婚姻法办事，而又用这种正确的处理来教育和提高群众对婚姻法的认识。对于干部今后在处理群众婚姻问题中违反婚姻法的事件，各级党委和政府必须立即纠正，批判其封建思想，并以此作为对干部的教育材料，对特别严重者还应该以违法乱纪论处。
    贯彻婚姻法的工作既然是一项关系于国家建设的、十分重要的经常工作，各地党委就应该经常重视这项工作。目前各地党委应具体领导各级贯彻婚姻法运动委员会，认真总结这次运动月的经验，根据这些经验订出经常贯彻婚姻法工作的办法，并且对这项工作进行专门的定期检查和研究，以巩固和扩大这次贯彻婚姻法运动月的成果。
