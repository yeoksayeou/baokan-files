    State-Owned Commercial Workers Should Pay Attention to Serving Production and Consumers

    Over the past three years, state-owned commerce has made great achievements in stabilizing prices, combating speculation, supporting production, and supplying the people's needs. Since the implementation of the economic accounting system, business management has also improved. However, there have been two extremely abnormal phenomena in operation: one is the out-of-stock situation of several commodities; the other is the unreasonable stockpiling of goods.

    The out-of-stock situation of several commodities is a common and serious problem. Many of the out-of-stock commodities are major commodities. In some areas, when they see a certain commodity is out of stock, they do not replenish it in time, and even transfer the same type of goods from inventory to other places.

    Unreasonable stockpiling of goods is still a problem that cannot be ignored. The number of unreasonably stockpiled goods is very large, and some have been stockpiled for a long time. Some areas, seeing that certain commodities are already seriously stockpiled, are still blindly purchasing goods.

    What does the simultaneous existence of these two phenomena indicate?

    There are many reasons for the unreasonable stockpiling of goods, such as the blind development of certain production undertakings; the prices of several commodities are not very reasonable; state-owned commerce undertakes some political procurement tasks, etc. However, a very important reason is that state-owned commercial workers have a poor understanding of production and sales situations and the needs of the people, and cannot grasp the laws of market supply, and their business management is very blind.

    This shortcoming is manifested in business as blind purchasing, blind processing, and blind allocation. Last year, the Harbin District Department Store Wholesale Station already had stockpiles of undershirts in the fourth quarter, but it processed another 150,500 "long waist, short legs, and large crotch" undershirts, which were not in line with the needs of the people, resulting in unreasonable stockpiling. It is manifested in enterprise management as a lack of connection between various links, disengagement from each other, slow allocation, excessively long commodity circulation time, and failure of commodities to meet consumers quickly. Last year, the Shenyang area Department Store Wholesale Station stockpiled nine train carriages of woolen sweaters, while the vast number of consumers were running around everywhere in the cold winter season but could not buy woolen sweaters, which is a prominent example.

    The reasons for the out-of-stock situation of several commodities are that the production of some commodities is still limited today; some enterprises have not yet connected their supply relationships well in the process of implementing the economic accounting system, and the capital allocation system is not yet perfect; but the most important reason is that some state-owned commercial workers lack a correct understanding of the reasons for the unreasonable stockpiling of goods, and have not distinguished between unreasonable stockpiles and reasonable inventory and necessary seasonal reserves, believing that the implementation of the economic accounting system is to compress inventory and compress capital. They have relaxed or even forgotten the responsibility of state-owned commerce to the market and to production. Therefore, in business, they do not actively and correctly organize the supply of goods, do not appropriately reduce the varieties of goods they handle; they only handle well-selling famous brand goods, and do not handle local goods that meet the needs of the people; they even do not want reasonable inventory, and do not want necessary seasonal reserves; and they also list well-selling goods in inventory as unsalable goods, and so on. In short, they have adopted the wrong attitude of buying less and selling less, ignoring production and ignoring the market.

    The poor performance of the implementation of the purchase and sales plan also illustrates this point. The China Department Store Company only completed 80.37% of the purchase plan in the first quarter (including imported goods), and although the sales plan was completed 98.86%, it decreased by 38.08% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, which exceeded the seasonal decline that should have been; the sales plan was also too small. The total value of domestic purchases by state-owned commerce in Northeast China in February was only equivalent to 22% of the total value of sales. By the end of March, the total number of goods shipped out by the Guangzhou Department Store Wholesale Station only accounted for 36.94% of the supply plan for the first quarter.

    The consequences of unreasonable stockpiling of goods and the out-of-stock situation of several commodities are both very serious.

    Due to the unreasonable stockpiling of goods, the turnover rate of state-owned commercial funds decreased from 2.3 times in 1951 to 1.8 times in 1952, and interest accounted for 36% of commodity circulation expenses, which not only affected the state's withdrawal of funds for construction, but also caused difficulties in the turnover of state-owned commerce itself.

    What are the consequences of the out-of-stock situation of several commodities? Some workers in Fushun City, unable to buy the goods they urgently needed and which the department store should supply, angrily tore up their wage coupons, saying: "The wage earned cannot buy goods, this wage coupon is as useless as waste paper."

    Last December, the roads in the Handan area were muddy after the snow, and local residents urgently needed rubber shoes, but the Handan District Department Store Wholesale Station did not actively purchase goods and could not guarantee market supply. Local private merchants sold each pair of rubber shoes at a price nearly 10,000 yuan higher than the list price.

    These two examples show that if state-owned commerce neglects market supply, it will affect the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market and increase the burden on consumers. The credibility of state-owned commerce itself will also be affected. For example, the Suihua District Department Store Wholesale Station has long been unable to meet the purchase requirements of department stores in various counties. Last winter, department stores in various counties only had two colors of cloth: black and white. The masses reflected: the department store is a "black and white company." Because the varieties of goods operated by department stores in various counties cannot meet the requirements of local consumers, the masses reflected: the department store is a "small goods company" and a "hundred-short company."

    These situations are enough to show that the common root cause of unreasonable stockpiling of goods and the out-of-stock situation of several commodities is that the idea that state-owned commerce should serve industrial and agricultural production and serve consumers has not yet been recognized and accepted by all state-owned commercial workers. Therefore, during the period of implementing the "large recall treasury system" and the "centralized allocation system for commodities," they did not study the needs of consumers, did not understand the laws of market supply, but only asked the higher authorities for money and goods, and blindly operated, resulting in unreasonable stockpiling of goods, and to a certain extent, also causing the blind development of individual production undertakings; after the implementation of fixed capital, independent calculation of profits and losses, and the implementation of the economic accounting system, they did not strive to actively expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation expenses, but simply compressed capital, compressed inventory, and disregarded production and the needs of the market, which is of course wrong.

    State-owned commercial workers should learn from the serious adverse effects on production and consumers caused by the unreasonable stockpiling of goods and the out-of-stock situation of several commodities, establish the idea of serving industrial and agricultural production and serving consumers, frequently understand the needs of the state and the people, correctly implement the policies of the Party and the state, actively complete the state's purchase and sales plans, vigorously promote industrial products, and at the same time actively influence industrial production, so that industrial production can continuously improve product quality and specifications, ensure sufficient market supply, and prevent unreasonable stockpiling of goods, under the unified plan of the state, strive to expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, reduce circulation expenses, implement the economic accounting system, increase enterprise accumulation, promote production development, and economic prosperity. This is the requirement of the Party and the state for state-owned commercial workers today, and it is also the glorious duty of state-owned commercial workers.

### 国营商业工作者应该注意为生产和消费者服务

    国营商业工作者应该注意为生产和消费者服务
    国营商业三年来在稳定物价、打击投机、扶助生产、供应人民需要方面，有很大成绩，自实行经济核算制以来，经营管理也有了改进。但在经营上曾经存在着两种极不正常的现象：一种是若干种商品脱销；一种是商品不合理的积压。
    若干种商品脱销是普遍存在的严重问题。脱销的商品很多是主要商品。有些地区眼看某种商品脱销，但不及时进货，甚至把库存的同类商品往外调出。
    商品不合理的积压依然是一个不容忽视的问题。不合理积压的商品为数甚大，有的积压的时间已经很长。有些地区眼看着某些商品已经严重地积压了，还在盲目进货。
    这两种现象同时存在，说明了一个什么问题呢？
    造成商品不合理积压的原因很多，如某些生产事业的盲目发展；若干种商品的价格不甚合理；国营商业担负了一些政治性的收购任务，等等。但国营商业工作者对产销情况和人民需要研究很差，掌握不住市场供应规律，经营管理带有很大的盲目性，是一个极其重要的原因。
    这种缺点表现在经营上是盲目采购，盲目加工，盲目调拨。哈尔滨区百货批发站去年第四季度已经积压了衬裤，但又加工十五万零五千条“腰长、腿短、裆大”的衬裤，因为不合人民需要，结果就造成了不合理的积压。表现在企业管理上，则是各个环节互不衔接，互相脱节，调拨迟缓，商品流转时间过长，商品不能迅速地和消费者见面。去年沈阳地区百货批发站曾积压了九火车厢的绒衣，而广大消费者在天寒地冻的季节到处奔走却买不到绒衣，就是一个突出的例子。
    造成若干种商品脱销的原因是，有些商品生产在今天还有一定的限制；有些企业单位在实行经济核算制过程中，供应关系还没有衔接好，资金调拨制度还不十分完善；但最主要的原因，是有些国营商业工作者对造成商品不合理积压的原因缺乏正确的了解，没有把不合理的积压和合理库存、季节性的必要储备加以分别，认为实行经济核算制就是为了压缩库存、压缩资金。放松了、甚至忘记了国营商业对市场、对生产的责任。因此，在经营上，不积极正确地组织货源，不适当地减少经营的品种；只经营好销的名牌货，而不经营适合人民需要的本地货；甚至连合理的库存也不要了，季节性的必要储备也不要了；把库存中好销的商品也列为呆滞货等等。总之，他们采取了少买少卖，不顾生产，不顾市场的错误态度。
    购销计划执行的成绩很差也说明了这一点。中国百货公司第一季度收购只完成计划百分之八十·三七（包括进口货），销售计划虽完成百分之九八·八六，但比去年第四季度下降了百分之三八·○八，这是超过了季节性下降应有的幅度的；销售计划也是偏小的。东北国营商业二月份国内进货总值仅相当于推销总值的百分之二十二。广州市百货批发站到三月下旬运出货物总数仅占第一季度供应计划的百分之三六·九四。
    商品不合理积压和若干种商品脱销的后果都是很严重的。
    由于商品不合理的积压，国营商业资金周转率由
    一九五一年的周转二·三次，降低成一九五二年的
    一·八次，商品流转费用中利息占了百分之三六，不仅影响了国家抽出资金投入建设，而且使国营商业本身周转发生了困难。
    若干种商品脱销的后果怎样呢？抚顺市有的工人，在百货公司买不到自己急需、而百货公司应该供应的货物，气愤愤地将工薪券撕了，他说：“挣得的工薪买不到货物，这工薪券和白纸一样没有用。”
    去年十二月邯郸地区雪后路途泥泞，当地居民迫切需要胶鞋，但邯郸区百货批发站不积极进货，不能保证市场供应，当地私商却以每双胶鞋高出牌价近万元的价格卖出。
    这两个例子说明：国营商业如果忽视市场供应，就将影响到国营商业对市场的领导作用，使消费者增加了负担。国营商业本身的信誉也会受到影响。像绥化区百货批发站，长期不能满足各县百货公司的进货要求，去年冬季各县百货公司只有黑、白两种布。群众反映：百货公司是“黑白公司”。由于各县百货公司经营的品种不能满足当地消费者的要求，群众反映：百货公司是“小货公司”、“百缺公司”。
    这些情况足以说明：商品不合理积压和若干种商品脱销的共同的根源，是国营商业应为工农业生产服务、为消费者服务的思想，还没有被所有的国营商业工作者所认识、所接受。因此，在实行“大回笼金库制”和“商品集中调拨制度”时期，不研究消费者需要，摸不透市场供应规律，只是向上级要钱要货，盲目经营，结果造成商品不合理积压，并在一定程度上也造成了个别生产事业的盲目发展；实行核定资金，独立计算盈亏，实行经济核算制后，不从积极扩大商品流通，加速资金周转，降低流转费用方面努力，只是单纯压缩资金，压缩库存，不顾生产，不顾市场的需要，这当然是错误的。
    国营商业工作者应该从商品不合理积压和若干种商品脱销引起的对生产对消费者的严重不良影响中吸取教训，树立为工农业生产服务、为消费者服务的思想，经常了解国家和人民的需要，正确地贯彻党和国家的政策，积极地完成国家的收购和销售计划，大力推销工业品，同时还要积极影响工业的生产，使工业生产不断地改善产品质量和规格，要保证市场充分供应，又要防止商品不合理的积压，在国家统一计划下，努力扩展商品流通，加速资金周转，降低流转费用，贯彻经济核算制，增进企业积累，促进生产发展，经济繁荣。这是党和国家今天对国营商业工作者的要求，也是国营商业工作者光荣的职责。
