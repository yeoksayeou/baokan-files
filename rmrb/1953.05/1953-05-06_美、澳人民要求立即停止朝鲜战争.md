Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 5th: American newspapers are increasingly featuring letters from various strata of American society demanding an immediate peace in Korea.

The New York "Daily Worker" on April 28th excerpted several representative letters: J.F. Lincoln, manager of Lincoln Electric Company, one of America's largest welding equipment manufacturers, wrote to a Cleveland newspaper on April 18th saying: "Personally, I would be quite satisfied if we could save the lives of our sons in Korea and completely discard the ‘face’ and heads of those responsible for this disaster in Korea.

"Now some are telling us that maintaining peace with Russia is impossible. Therefore, despite their invitation... we continue to prepare for war instead of trying to find a peaceful solution."

J.F. Lincoln said: "The government no longer reflects the will of the people. On the contrary, it wants to rule everything. Isn't it time for us to stop intimidating the Soviet Union and start thinking about our people and their happiness?

"We keep hearing that we cannot withdraw from Korea, where we should never have gone in the first place, because if we withdraw, we will ‘lose face.’ We don't seem to care about the sacrifice of our sons…"

In the "Michigan Farmer," published in East Lansing, a reader wrote: "My choice on the Korean issue is to leave Korea. Leaving now is no worse than leaving later. We have to withdraw anyway… We ourselves do not respect our signatures at the Geneva Conference regarding the exchange of prisoners of war, and of course we say that the Russians are breaking their agreements." This reader emphasized in the letter: "Military force can never bring lasting peace."

Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: According to a report in the Sydney "Tribune," a public opinion poll conducted by the New South Wales Peace Council in Australia on the Korean War shows that those who participated in the survey almost unanimously favored an immediate end to the war.

The survey began in February. The question was: "Do you support an immediate ceasefire in Korea?" In the initial two thousand and twenty responses, only seven were negative. These replies were taken to Canberra, the Australian capital, by the Peace Crusaders on March 12th. The Peace Council also decided to expand this public opinion poll.

The hope for an early realization of peace in Korea, rekindled by the Korean and Chinese side's new proposals on the Korean armistice negotiations, has increased people's interest in this public opinion poll. More and more regions, factories, and groups are requesting to participate in the survey. Since the New South Wales Peace Council decided to expand this public opinion poll, it has received another five hundred affirmative responses.

    美、澳人民要求立即停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社布拉格五日电】美国报纸上越来越多地出现美国各阶层人民要求立即实现朝鲜和平的信件。
    纽约“工人日报”四月二十八日摘录了几封有代表性的信：美国一家最大的电焊器械制造公司林肯电气公司经理杰·弗·林肯在四月十八日写信给克利夫兰报纸说：“就我自己来说，如果我们能够保全我们在朝鲜的子弟的生命而完全丢掉对朝鲜这场灾难应负责任的人们的‘面子’和脑袋，我也是很满意的。
    “现在又有人在告诉我们说，与俄国保持和平是不可能的。因此，尽管他们提出邀请……我们仍然继续准备战争，而不企图求得和平解决。”
    杰·弗·林肯说：“政府已不再反映人民的意愿。相反地，它想统治一切。现在不是我们停止恫吓苏联，开始想一想我们的人民和他们的幸福的时候了吗？
    “我们不断地听到说：我们不可能撤出我们根本就不应该去的朝鲜，因为如果我们撤离那里，我们就要‘丢面子’。我们似乎不在乎我们子弟的牺牲……”
    在东兰星出版的“密执安农民报”上，一个读者写道：“我在朝鲜问题上的选择是离开朝鲜。现在离开不比以后离开差。反正我们是必须撤出来……我们自己不尊重我们在日内瓦会议关于交换战俘的规定上的签字，当然就说俄国人破坏了他们的协定。”这个读者在信里强调：“军事力量永远不能使天下太平无事。”
    【新华社五日讯】据悉尼“论坛报”报道：澳大利亚新南威尔士和平委员会就朝鲜战争问题所举行的民意测验表明，参加测验的人差不多一致赞成立即停止这个战争。
    这个测验是从二月间开始的。测验的问题是：“你赞成立即在朝鲜停火吗？”在最初的二千零二十份答复中，只有七份是否定的。这些答复已由和平十字军在三月十二日带往澳大利亚首都堪培拉。和平委员会并决定扩大这种民意测验。
    由于朝中方面关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的新建议而重新燃起的在朝鲜早日实现和平的希望，增加了人们对这次民意测验的兴趣。各地区、工厂和团体要求参加测验的人越来越多。自从新南威尔士和平委员会决定扩大这种民意测验以来，又收到了五百份肯定的答复。
