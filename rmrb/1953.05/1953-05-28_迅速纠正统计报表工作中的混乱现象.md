    Quickly Correct the Chaotic Phenomenon in Statistical Reporting Work
    By Our Reporter Ai Fang

    Recently, the East China Financial and Economic Committee conducted an inspection of statistical work and found that the chaotic phenomenon in statistical work was very serious and must be clarified quickly.

    In all systems, including finance and economics, politics and law, culture and education, and health, from the central competent departments to the Greater Administrative Regions, provinces, cities, and grassroots units such as industrial and mining enterprises, shops, and villages, reports are issued and forwarded at every level, in large quantities. According to preliminary statistics from the East China Statistics Bureau, the number of forms forwarded and issued by East China-level government units—currently implemented regular reports and temporary reports forwarded and issued in the past year—totals 17,579 types. According to preliminary statistics from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Statistics Bureau, more than 42.22 million forms were filled out in the province in the past year.

    Many of these reports are necessary. However, many are unnecessary, or the effort expended is disproportionate to the results obtained. This also concentrates many serious problems in the thinking, work style, and work of many cadres and departments.

    There is a tendency to deviate from reality and the masses when formulating report forms

    Many statistical forms require a broad scope, even encompassing everything. Several formulators did not consider whether each item they requested was possible to implement, or necessary to fill out, and determined them based solely on subjective requirements, resulting in detachment from reality and the masses. The original Sunan Grain Company issued a "Daily Grain Situation Report," which included everything from an overview and analysis of the grain situation, problems existing in prices and operations, opinions on these problems, wholesale, retail, and purchase market prices and listed prices of various commodities and their percentage differences, grain flow, purchase and sale situation of various economic components, and transaction volumes inside and outside the market, all the way to merchant dynamics and mass reactions. Such a form required filling in 1,184 numbers, 359 percentages, and four columns of written explanations. The formulators of this type of statistical table certainly put a lot of thought into it, and understanding these contents is naturally useful, but they did not consider who could completely fill out so many items? As a result, the forms often disappeared without a trace once issued, and even if they were filled out, they were either estimated figures or retained many blanks.

    In addition, some materials that are neither necessary nor possible, or do not require universal statistics, are also required to be statistically compiled by everyone. Some health departments issue forms requiring everyone to report the number or weight of flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, maggots, mosquito larvae, rats, etc., killed in the health campaign, and some even add conditions, requiring the tails of captured rats to be cut off, soaked in alcohol, and submitted level by level. The East China Committee of the Communist Youth League required the "Survey and Statistical Table of Sports Conditions in Various Parts of East China" to include the increase or decrease in the number of sports enthusiasts after basketball and volleyball games. The "Survey Table of Public and Private Theaters" issued by the Central Ministry of Culture required theaters to fill in "audience composition."

    The masses' criticism of such statistical work and cadres doing such statistical work is: "Having nothing better to do, they come to make trouble!" This should attract our deep attention.

    Multiple heads and brains, issuing reports indiscriminately

    The situation of mutual disconnection and decentralized operation between superiors and subordinates and between left and right in statistical work is also serious.

    Last year, the Salt Affairs Bureau, the original East China Ministry of Industry, and other agencies issued a total of four sets of production increase and conservation reports to the East China Salt Affairs Administration, with basically the same content, but with differences in format and calculation methods. This caused a lot of trouble and waste for the reporting units. Regarding the statistical table on material exchange between urban and rural areas in East China, both the Urban and Rural Material Exchange Office of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the government's trade departments arranged a set, with most of the content overlapping. All of these are caused by the lack of connection between superiors and subordinates and between left and right.

    The same situation exists within an agency. A section of the East China Financial and Economic Committee once asked the original East China Department Store Company for a balance sheet of material production and sales four times. The requirements of the four forms were the same, but the figures were different. After inspection, it was found that the four pieces of information were submitted by three different departments of the department store company. The rural finance section, currency management section, and planning section of the Songjiang branch of the People's Bank of China received instructions from various departments of the provincial bank, requiring them to report the amount of currency issuance. All three sections sent cadres to various companies to urge them, and when everyone met at a company, they realized that what was required was the same figure. Some agencies copy a figure from someone else today, and then copy it back from there tomorrow. The waste caused by this is also impossible to calculate.

    Bureaucracy and commandism in statistical work

    The chaotic situation in statistical work is inseparable from the bureaucratic and commandist style of work.

    Some reports are hastily arranged without careful consideration, so they are revised again and again, leaving the lower levels at a loss. The plan table for 1953 issued by the agricultural department initially stipulated that the unit of calculation was "hectare," "kilogram," and "thousand yuan." After the lower levels converted it, it was changed to "jin," "mu," and "thousand yuan" for the second time.

    Some reports have deadlines that are too tight, making it impossible for the lower levels to complete them on time. Some reports are issued to the lower levels after the deadline has already passed. When filling out agencies and cadres receive such forms, they often mobilize immediately, visit everywhere, and rush to create them overnight, which is exactly what some farmers and cadres say: "Cadres run all over the streets, for the sake of statistical tables." Some figures cannot be investigated for a while and can only be "estimated." Someone said: This table cannot be disbelieved—because it is the only copy; but don't believe it—because it is not accurate.

    Some agencies believe that everything is fine after the statistical forms are arranged and distributed. They no longer supervise or inspect. Some reports have become outdated. They also do not notify the cancellation, and when the lower levels encounter questions and ask for instructions, some do not respond. Some cadres know that the forms they issue cannot be filled out below, and they falsely use the name of leading agencies to arrange them downward—this is no longer general bureaucracy and commandism, but serious violation of laws and discipline.

    The bad consequences

    The chaotic phenomenon in statistical work has caused many adverse consequences.

    First, manpower and material resources are seriously wasted, and grassroots units and the masses regard it as a heavy burden. Many statistical cadres in grassroots units are so busy that they are dizzy, but it is still difficult to complete the "task." Some reports are submitted but cannot be comprehensively utilized due to inconsistent calibers. Since last spring, the Finance and Economic Committee of Ju County, Shandong Province, has issued 64 types of survey tables to the base points, and other departments in the county have issued 74 types. The famous Lu Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative received 255 types of statistical tables issued layer by layer in the spring. At present, most of them have been filled out, but some have not yet been filled out. All the forms issued are "important" and "urgent." Among them, those indiscriminately issued and unrealistic reports have affected the practical, important, and regular statistical work.

    Second, some unrealistic figures and reports have been forced out. Investigation and statistics are a scientific work, but if used improperly, it will encourage the bad habit of making false reports.

    The chaotic situation in statistical work must be clarified quickly

    To make statistical work more standardized and accurate, and to clarify the chaotic phenomenon, the fundamental method is to overcome the bureaucratic, commandist, and decentralist style of work, and to promote a scientific, realistic, and meticulous statistical work system and method. This already has a good foundation at present. The struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline has gradually unfolded in various places, and unified statistical institutions have also been generally established and gradually improved throughout the country. On this basis, the vast number of cadres and the masses must fully recognize the importance, scientific nature, high organization, and seriousness of statistical work. Article 1 of the State Council's decision on enriching statistical institutions and strengthening statistical work points out: "If statistical forms are issued indiscriminately without approval, or reports are not filled out and submitted as required, they shall be regarded as violations of discipline and shall be corrected. As for those who falsely report figures or fabricate statistical data, it is an act of disloyalty to the state and shall be severely punished." This instruction must be earnestly implemented and a resolute struggle must be waged against the act of indiscriminately issuing statistical forms to end the chaotic phenomenon in statistical work.

    迅速纠正统计报表工作中的混乱现象
    本报记者  艾方
    最近，华东财委对统计工作进行了一次检查，发现统计工作中的混乱现象十分严重，必须迅速澄清。
    无论财经、政法、文教卫生等系统，从中央的主管部门起，经大行政区、省、市到工矿企业、商店、乡村等基层单位，层层颁发、转发报表，数量很大。据华东统计局初步统计，华东一级的机关单位转发、颁发的表格——现仍在执行的定期报表和一年来转发、颁发的临时性的报表——共一万七千五百七十九种。据浙江省人民政府统计局的初步统计，全省一年来填报表格达四千二百二十二万多张。
    这些报表有很多是必需的。但有许多是不必要的，或者所化力量和所得效果极不相称。这里也集中地表现了许多干部和许多部门思想上、作风上、工作上的一些严重问题。
    制订报表时有脱离实际脱离群众的倾向
    有许多统计表格，要求范围广阔，甚至包罗万象。若干制订表格者没有考虑到他们要求的每一个项目是否可能办到，是否必要填报，单凭主观要求确定下来，结果就脱离了实际，脱离了群众。原苏南粮食公司颁发的“粮情日报表”，从粮情概述、分析，价格上、经营上所存在的问题，对这些问题的意见，各种商品批发、零售、收购的市价、牌价及其差异百分比，粮食流向，各种经济成份的购销情况和市场内外的交易数量，一直到商人动态、群众反映，一切俱全。这样一张表要填一千一百八十四个数字，三百五十九个百分比，有四栏文字说明。像这一类的统计表，制表者确实是费了一番心思的，这些内容，了解了自然也有用处，但是他们没有考虑到这么多项目谁能完全填好呢？结果，往往是表格发下即如石沉大海，有的虽然填了，但不是估计数字，就是保留很多空白。
    另外，还有一些既不需要也不可能或不需要普遍统计的材料，也要大家来统计。有的卫生部门，发出表格，要大家填报在卫生运动中打死蝇、蚊、蚤、虱、蛆、孑孓、老鼠等的只数、斤数，有的还附加条件，要把已捕老鼠的尾巴割下，用酒精泡好，逐级上缴。青年团华东团委在“华东各地体育情况调查统计表”内要求填报篮、排球比赛后，爱好运动者的增减数字。中央文化部所发“公私营剧场调查表”内要求剧场填报“观众成份”。
    群众对这样的统计工作、做这样统计工作的干部的批评是：吃了饭没事干，没有事就来找麻烦！这是应该引起我们深切注意的。
    多头多脑，乱发报表
    在统计工作上的上下左右互不联系，分散进行的情况也是严重的。
    去年，盐务总局、原华东工业部等机关发到华东盐务管理局的增产节约报表共有四套，内容基本相同，只是格式和计算方法有出入。这样，就给填报单位造成许多麻烦和浪费。关于华东城乡物资交流的统计表，中共中央华东局城乡物资交流办公室、政府的贸易部门都布置了一套，内容大部重复。凡此种种，都是由于上下左右互不联系所造成的。
    在一个机关内部，同样存在着这种情况。华东财委的一个处，曾先后向原华东区百货公司要了四次物资产销平衡表，四种表格的要求相同，但数字却不一样。经检查，才知道四份资料是百货公司的三个不同部门报送的。人民银行松江支行农村金融股、货币管理股、计划股曾接到省银行各部门的指示，要求报送货币投放数。三个股都派干部到各公司催问，当大家在一个公司碰了头的时候，才知道要的原是一个数字。有些机关今天被人家抄去一个数字，明天又从那里抄回来。这样造成的浪费，也是无法统计的。
    统计工作中的官僚主义和命令主义
    统计工作中的混乱状况，是和工作中的官僚主义、命令主义作风分不开的。
    有些报表，没有经过周密考虑就草率布置，因而一改再改，使下边无所适从。农业部门发下的一九五三年的计划表，第一次规定计算单位是“公顷”、
    “公斤”、“千元”，下级折合好了，第二次又改为“市斤”、“市亩”、“千元”了。
    有些报表限期过急，使下边无法按期完成。有的报表发到下面，限期已经过了。填报机关、干部接到这类表格的时候，往往是立刻动员，到处访问，星夜赶造，这正像某些农民、干部所说的：“干部满街跑，为了统计表”。有些数字一时调查不出，只能“估计”。有人说：这张表不可不信——因为只此一份；但千万别信——因为它不确实。
    有些机关把统计表格布置下去，就认为万事大吉。再不督促检查。有些报表已失时效。也不通知废止，下边遇到疑问，向上请示，有的也不予答复。有些干部知道他们发下的表格下边无法填，竟假冒领导机关的名义往下布置。——这已不是一般的官僚主义、命令主义，而是严重的违法乱纪了。
    造成的恶果
    统计工作中的混乱现象，造成许多不良后果。
    第一，人力、物力浪费严重，基层单位、群众视为沉重负担。有很多基层单位的统计干部，忙得头昏眼花，仍然难以完成“任务”。有些报表交上去了由于口径不对，不能综合利用。去春以来，山东莒县财委颁发到基点的调查表有六十四种，县的其他部门发了七十四种。有名的吕鸿宾农业生产合作社在春天接到层层颁发来的统计表二百五十五种，目前除已填好大部外，还有一部分未填起。凡发下的表格，都是“重要”、“火急”。其中那些乱发的、不切实际的报表，倒把那切实、重要、正规的统计工作影响了。
    第二、逼出了一些不符实际的数字和报告。调查统计是一种科学的工作，但用乱了就会助长了做假报告的恶劣作风。
    统计工作中的混乱状况必须迅速澄清
    使统计工作更加正规、准确，澄清混乱现象的根本方法，就是克服官僚主义、命令主义和分散主义的作风，提倡科学的、实事求是的作风和周密的统计工作制度和办法。这在目前已经有了很好的基础。各地反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争已逐渐展开，全国统一的统计机构也普遍建立并逐渐健全起来。在这个基础上，要使广大干部和群众充分认识统计工作的重要性、科学性、高度组织性和严肃性。政务院关于充实统计机构加强统计工作的决定第一条中就指出：“如有不经批准乱发统计表格，不按规定填送报表者，得视为违反纪律行为，应予纠正。至于假报数字或谎报统计资料者，则为对国家不忠实的行为，应予严厉的处分。”必须认真执行这一指示，和乱发统计表格的行为作坚决的斗争，以终止统计工作中的混乱现象。
