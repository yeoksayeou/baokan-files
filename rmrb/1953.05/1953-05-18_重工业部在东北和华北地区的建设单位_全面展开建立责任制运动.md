    Heavy Industry Department Launches Responsibility System Campaign in Construction Units in Northeast and North China

    [This newspaper dispatch] The construction units and construction enterprises of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in Northeast and North China have fully launched a campaign against waste, against irresponsibility, and to establish a responsibility system.

    More than ten units, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the First and Second Engineering Companies of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, and Harbin Riveting and Welding Factory, have mobilized the masses to carry out this campaign and have achieved initial results. The leading cadres of these units deeply recognize the serious harm of waste and irresponsibility to the country's construction cause. Before launching this campaign, they seized the time to summarize their past work, so that they would have a clear understanding and purpose. After the campaign was launched, they paid attention to understanding the ideological situation of the workers, took effective measures in a timely manner to dispel the masses' concerns, guided the masses to expose the main problems in construction and solve the main problems, and closely integrated the campaign with construction or construction preparation work in order to promote the central task.

    Wang Yuqing, Deputy General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Liu Jiadong, Deputy Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, directly led the company's anti-construction waste and establishment of the responsibility system campaign. At the beginning of the campaign, they repeatedly carried out mobilization work to achieve a consistent understanding among leaders at all levels, and the campaign was launched vigorously. Three of the four managers of the large rolling mill construction site were specifically responsible for leading the campaign, fully mobilizing the masses. Within four days, the masses exposed more than 3,000 large and small waste incidents and put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals. Construction companies such as steelmaking and rolling steel engineering companies held short-term training courses for team and group leaders and activists to cultivate backbone elements in the campaign. After returning to their units, they vigorously publicized the campaign's principles and objectives, which enabled the campaign to receive enthusiastic support from the masses. All construction units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have combined the current work to conduct inspections and summaries, and have focused on the main problems to carry out the campaign. The large rolling mill construction site, in response to key issues in the work, proposed to strengthen the technical supply work as the focus of carrying out the campaign; the thin plate mill construction site, in order to ensure the quality of the project, proposed to strengthen the cement team as the focus. This makes this campaign have a clear direction.

    Leading cadres of the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration systematically summarized the waste and irresponsibility phenomena in last year's construction before the campaign, and had a clear understanding of the establishment of the responsibility system. When mobilizing the masses, they carried out patriotic education. In late April, the first construction site put forward the slogan "Do three things well (1. raise questions, find out the reasons; 2. think of ways to improve the work; 3. formulate good systems and implement them.) to welcome the start of construction and offer gifts to May Day!" Calling on workers to put forward rationalization proposals and set up a "Gift Offering Platform" had great results. At the beginning of the campaign, technicians had concerns, fearing that they would be "rectified." The company's leading cadres studied this issue in a timely manner, actively absorbed technicians to participate in the leadership of the campaign, assigned them specific tasks, and dispelled the technicians' concerns through visits, forums, and individual conversations. At present, the company is entering the stage of exposing waste and irresponsibility.

    All units that have earnestly mobilized the masses to carry out the campaign have begun to show a new atmosphere. The Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration conducted on-site inspections and educated the masses through a variety of publicity methods, which had great results. The workers reflected: in the past, they felt that the waste was not great, but now when they opened their eyes, they saw waste everywhere. In the past, iron nails were all over the construction site and no one cared, but now whoever saw them would pick them up. Before the start of the campaign, the construction sites that had already started construction had cement workers and bricklayers going to work at the same time, but the bricklayers had no cement to use and had to wait for an hour before working; after the start of the campaign, everyone paid attention to this problem, and the cement workers went to work an hour earlier, and the problem of the bricklayers idling was solved. However, from the perspective of the entire campaign, the progress is very uneven, mainly because the leading cadres of some units are "afraid that the campaign will affect the current work" or do not know how to combine it with the current work, so formalism has arisen. One approach is to try to end the campaign hastily after exposing some waste phenomena, and the other approach is to formulate some responsibility systems from above and take them to the lower levels for implementation. All units that have done this have taken detours and have not been able to truly establish the responsibility system, and even if there is a system, it cannot be implemented. These cadres do not understand that anti-waste and establishment of the responsibility system are two aspects of one campaign and are indispensable. However, in order to make the campaign fully developed, it must be closely combined with the current work. The First Work Zone of the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry initially emphasized the importance of construction preparation work and attempted to end the campaign hastily. Later, after inspection, it was found that the preparation work was not done well due to irresponsibility. Subsequently, the work zone combined this campaign with construction preparation work, and the campaign was carried out smoothly and promoted the construction preparation work.

### 重工业部在东北和华北地区的建设单位  全面展开建立责任制运动

    重工业部在东北和华北地区的建设单位
    全面展开建立责任制运动
    【本报讯】中央重工业部在东北和华北地区的建设单位和施工企业，全面展开反对浪费、反对无人负责、建立责任制运动。
    鞍山钢铁公司，有色金属工业管理局第一、第二两工程公司，哈尔滨铆焊厂等十余单位发动群众开展这个运动，已收到初步成效。这些单位的领导干部深切地认识到浪费和无人负责的现象对国家建设事业的严重危害性，在开展这个运动之前，就抓紧时间对过去的工作进行了总结，做到心中有数、目的明确；运动开展之后，他们又注意掌握职工的思想情况，及时采取有效措施，打消群众顾虑，引导群众揭发施工中的主要问题和解决主要问题；并使运动与施工或施工准备工作紧密地结合起来，以便推进中心工作。
    鞍山钢铁公司副总经理王玉清和中共鞍山市委员会副书记刘家栋直接领导该公司的反施工浪费、建立责任制运动。他们在运动开始时，反复地进行了动员工作，使各级领导干部取得了一致的认识，运动有力地开展起来。大型轧钢厂工地的四个经理，有三个专门负责运动的领导工作，充分发动了群众。四天之内群众揭发大小浪费事件三千多条，提出一百多条合理化建议。炼钢、轧钢工程公司等单位，举办了班、组长和积极分子短期训练班，培养运动中的骨干分子。他们回到各单位之后，大力宣传了运动的方针和目的，使运动得到了群众热烈的支持。鞍钢各建设单位都结合当前工作进行了检查与总结，抓住主要问题开展运动。大型轧钢厂工地针对工作中的关键问题，提出以加强技术供应工作为开展运动的重点；薄板厂工地为保证工程质量，提出以加强水泥队为重点。这就使得这个运动有着明确的方向。
    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司领导干部，在运动之前比较有系统地总结了去年施工中的浪费与无人负责的现象，对建立责任制有了明确的认识。在发动群众时，他们进行了爱国主义教育。第一工地在四月下旬提出了“做好三件事（一、提出问题，找出原因；二、想出办法，改进工作；三、订好制度，贯彻执行。）迎接开工，向五一节献礼！”的口号，号召职工提合理化建议，设立“献礼台”，收效很大。运动开始时，技术人员有顾虑，怕“挨整”。公司领导干部及时研究了这个问题，积极吸收技术人员参加运动的领导，分给他们具体的工作；并通过拜访、座谈、个别谈话等方式，打消了技术人员的顾虑。目前该公司正进入揭发浪费与无人负责的现象的阶段。
    所有认真发动群众开展运动的单位，已开始出现新气象。有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司进行现场检查，用多种多样的宣传方式教育群众，收效很大。职工们反映：过去觉得浪费不大，现在睁眼一看到处有浪费。过去工地里铁钉满地无人管，现在谁看见了谁就拾起来。运动开始以前，已经开工的工地，水泥工和瓦工同一时间上班，瓦工没有水泥用，要等一个钟头后才工作；运动开始后，大家注意到了这个问题，水泥工提早一小时上班，瓦工窝工的问题就解决了。但是从整个运动来看，进度很不平衡，主要是有些单位的领导干部“怕运动影响当前工作”，或者不知道如何与当前工作相结合，于是就产生了形式主义的作法。一种作法是在揭发一些浪费现象后就想草率收兵，另一种作法是由上边制订一些责任制度拿到下边去执行。凡是这样做的单位都走了弯路，都不能真正把责任制建立起来，就是有了制度也不能贯彻执行。这些干部不了解反浪费与建立责任制是一个运动的两个方面，缺一不可。但是要使得运动全面地开展起来，还必须与当前工作紧密结合。重工业部直属建设工程公司第一工区，开始时强调施工准备工作重要，曾企图草率结束运动，后来经过检查，发现准备工作没做好，就是由于无人负责造成的。随后该工区把这个运动与施工准备工作结合起来进行，运动就顺利地开展起来，并推动了施工准备工作。
