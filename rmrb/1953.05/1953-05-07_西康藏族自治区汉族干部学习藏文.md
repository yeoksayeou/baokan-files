Cultural Briefs:

    Han cadres in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region are actively learning Tibetan language and writing, while Tibetan and Yi cadres are also voluntarily participating in the study of Han language. Since the third session of the People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region last November passed the resolution on developing ethnic languages and encouraging cadres of all ethnic groups to learn Tibetan language and writing as well as Han language, the People's Government of the autonomous region has established ethnic language classes, and the Kangding Local Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also transferred more than 30 on-the-job cadres to specialize in the study of ethnic languages; all counties have formulated plans for leading Han cadres to learn Tibetan language and writing. Many Han cadres have included learning ethnic languages in their personal work plans or patriotic covenants, and they still take the time to study while helping farmers with spring plowing this spring. At present, Han cadres have generally learned about 100 Tibetan sentences, and some can already conduct simple Tibetan conversations. In the process of learning Tibetan language and writing, Han cadres in various places have received enthusiastic support from people of all walks of life in Tibet. Many local Tibetan leaders and religious figures personally serve as Tibetan teachers. At the same time, many Tibetan cadres, in order to facilitate the study of Chairman Mao's works and obtain more help from Han cadres, also automatically request to learn Chinese language. Tibetan and Han cadres in various counties have launched activities of mutual teaching and learning of Tibetan and Han languages.

    西康藏族自治区汉族干部学习藏文
    西康省藏族自治区的汉族干部正在积极学习藏语藏文，藏、彝族干部也自愿参加了汉族语文的学习。自去年十一月自治区第三届各族各界人民代表会议作出关于发展民族语文和鼓励各民族干部学习藏语藏文及汉族语文的决议后，自治区人民政府便成立了民族语文班，中国共产党康定地方工作委员会也抽调了三十多名在职干部专门学习民族语文；各县都制订了领导汉族干部学习藏语藏文的计划。许多汉族干部把学好民族语文订入个人的工作计划或爱国公约，他们今春下乡帮助农民春耕时，还抽出时间坚持学习。现在，汉族干部已普遍学会了一百句左右藏语，有的已经能作简单的藏语会话了。各地汉族干部在学习藏语藏文中，得到了藏族各界人士的热心赞助。许多当地藏族领袖人物和宗教界人士亲自担任藏文教员。同时，许多藏族干部为了便于学习毛主席著作和取得汉族干部的更多帮助，也自动要求学习汉文、汉语。各县藏、汉族干部间已开展了藏、汉语文互教互学的活动。
