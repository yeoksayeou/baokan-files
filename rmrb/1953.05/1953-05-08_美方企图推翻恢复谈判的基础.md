Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. Our special correspondent reports: Although world public opinion has warned Harrison not to adopt a rude and unreasonable attitude in the negotiations to delay them, Harrison is now demanding that after the armistice, all Korean prisoners of war be "released" in South Korea on the spot, which is actually to hand them over to the Syngman Rhee gang. In this way, Harrison not only has not changed his attitude, which has been condemned by world public opinion, but also attempts to overthrow the basis of the negotiations.

The Korean armistice negotiations were resumed on the basis of the Korean-Chinese side's new proposal. The basic content of this new proposal, as Premier Zhou Enlai clarified in his statement on March 30, is: "Both sides of the negotiations should guarantee the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war they hold who insist on repatriation after the armistice, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries to ensure a fair solution to the issue of their repatriation." Clark and Harrison themselves have repeatedly admitted that handing over prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral countries is the basis for resuming negotiations. In his letter to our side on April 16, Harrison actually accepted the Korean-Chinese side's proposal and requested "for practical purposes, the prisoners of war not directly repatriated be released to neutral nations for custody in Korea." At the first meeting of the two delegations after the resumption of negotiations on April 26, Harrison, when quoting his own letter of April 16, also admitted that the U.S. side hoped to use our side's proposal as "a suitable basis for discussion." As late as May 5, Harrison, in a statement to reporters after the meeting, also said: "An armistice agreement can be reached on this basis. Therefore, we agree to use this proposal as the basis for resuming negotiations."

However, the day after, Harrison wanted to overthrow this basis that he himself had agreed to, demanding that the Korean prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated should not be handed over to neutral countries, but "released" on the spot. Since the resumption of the armistice negotiations, Harrison has never adopted a consultative attitude, nor has he made any effort to promote progress in the negotiations. On the contrary, Harrison has now taken a big step backward, attempting to directly overthrow the basis for resuming negotiations. In contrast to Harrison's attitude, the Korean-Chinese side today again demonstrated its great sincerity in seeking an armistice in Korea and put forward a new plan for the practical steps to solve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. This is another new effort made by the Korean-Chinese side to make progress in the negotiations. Whether an armistice can be achieved quickly now depends entirely on whether Harrison is willing to remove the obstacles he has set up and conduct sincere consultations.

### 美方企图推翻恢复谈判的基础

    美方企图推翻恢复谈判的基础
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者报道：虽然世界舆论已经警告哈利逊不要在谈判中采取蛮横无理的态度来拖延谈判，但是哈利逊现在却又要求在停战以后在南朝鲜就地“释放”一切朝鲜籍的战俘，实际上就是要把他们交给李承晚匪帮。这样，哈利逊不但没有改变他的受到世界舆论谴责的态度，而且企图推翻谈判的基础。
    朝鲜停战谈判是在朝中方面的新建议的基础上恢复的。这个新建议的基本内容，正如周恩来总理在三月三十日的声明中所阐明的，就是：“谈判双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。”克拉克和哈利逊自己也都一再承认过，将不直接遣返的战俘交给中立国是恢复谈判的基础。哈利逊在他四月十六日给我方的信中，实际上已经接受了朝中方面的建议，并且要求“为求实际可行，未被直接遣返的战俘释交中立国在朝鲜收容”。在四月二十六日谈判恢复以后双方代表团第一次会议上，哈利逊在引述他自己四月十六日的信时，也承认美方希望以我方的建议
    “作为讨论的适当基础”。就在五月五日，哈利逊在会议以后向新闻记者发表的声明中还说：“根据这个协议是能够达成停战协议的。因此，我们同意利用这个建议作为恢复谈判的基础。”
    但是，隔了一天之后，哈利逊却想推翻这个他自己同意过的基础，要求将不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘不是交给中立国，而是就地“释放”了。从停战谈判恢复以来，哈利逊从来没有采取过协商的态度，也从来没有作过促使谈判取得进展的任何努力。相反，哈利逊现在往后退了一大步，企图直接推翻恢复谈判的基础。和哈利逊的态度相反，朝中方面今天又表现了谋求朝鲜停战的极大诚意，提出了解决战俘遣返问题的实际步骤的新方案。这是朝中方面为使谈判获得进展所作的又一次新努力。停战能否迅速实现，现在完全要看哈利逊是否愿意除掉他所设下的障碍来进行诚意的协商了。
