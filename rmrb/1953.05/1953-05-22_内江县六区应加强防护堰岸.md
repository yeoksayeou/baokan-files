    Neijiang County's Sixth District Should Strengthen Protection of Embankments
    A letter from reader Wu Shijie of People's Township, Fourth Village, Sixth District, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province: There is a small earthen river embankment in Biba Chong, which can store water to irrigate paddy fields within two li on both banks. However, the district and township governments failed to mobilize and organize the masses to regularly inspect and protect it, resulting in a small leaking hole at the foot of the embankment not being discovered in time, and being washed into a large hole about two and a half chi in diameter, causing all the stored water to leak out, affecting the irrigation of paddy fields. I hope that the local people's government will quickly organize the peasant masses to plug this large hole, and strengthen the inspection and protection of the embankment in the future.

    内江县六区应加强防护堰岸
    四川省内江县读者吴仕杰来信：内江六区人民乡四村笓笆冲有土筑小河堰一座，蓄水可灌溉两岸二华里内的水田。但当地区、乡政府没能发动和组织群众经常检查防护，以致堰脚下的一个漏水小洞未被及时发觉，冲成直径约二市尺半的大洞，使蓄水全部漏光，影响了水田的灌溉。我希望当地人民政府赶快组织农民群众堵好这个大漏洞，并在今后加强对堰岸的检查防护工作。
