Youth Eagle
    Jin Feng
    One evening in April 1953, in a room at a base of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, a captured American pilot sat there dejectedly. This aerial bandit, whose hands were stained with the blood of the Korean people, unexpectedly became a prisoner today.

    A young pilot from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force walked in. He was strong, radiant, and looked energetic in his flight suit. He sized up the American pilot intently.

    The American pilot turned his face away uneasily, lowering his head. Perhaps he couldn't bear the gaze of righteous condemnation. Perhaps he hadn't imagined that he would be defeated by such a young Volunteer Army pilot.

    This young pilot was Han Decai, only twenty years old this year. Having participated in combat for just a year, he had already shot down five enemy planes. The Second-Class Combat Hero Medal awarded by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shone brightly on his chest. His youth also radiated the brilliance of combat victory.

    In early 1952, Han Decai, the son of a poor peasant and a member of the Communist Youth League, driven by the determination to defend the motherland, avenge the Korean people, and severely punish American aerial bandits, flew a plane donated by the people of the motherland to the Korean front.

    The arduous combat life tested him. Here, he had to get up at three in the morning, facing the stars and moon, and the car would drive straight to the airport. At this time, he often thought that his little brother must have already been fast asleep, and his mother, tired after a day's work, must also be resting. The night in the motherland was peaceful, and the dreams of the people of the motherland were sweet. It was precisely for these reasons that he was far away from the motherland, fighting tensely in the skies over Korea. He often thought this way, cheerfully climbing into the cockpit; then concentrating his mind, waiting for the signal to take off for battle.

    In order not to disappoint the hopes of the people of the motherland, to better master flight techniques, and to strike the American aerial bandits even harder, he trained tenaciously. Together with the lead aircraft pilot, while walking, skating, playing ball, in almost every possible situation, they were figuring out the characteristics of the lead aircraft's movements, learning how to better cooperate with the lead aircraft in combat. Thus, gradually his and the lead aircraft's combat actions became as if they were one person. When they were in the air, as long as the lead aircraft's wings wagged, he would know what action he should take, often increasing the throttle and turning the steering wheel to the left before the lead aircraft even shouted "Turn left."

    Once, he encountered enemy planes, and he tried his best to attack them, but without any results. He was impatient, he was annoyed, and he couldn't sleep soundly at night; he even doubted whether a wingman could shoot down enemies. At this time, the Party once again educated him: as a wingman pilot, he shouldn't only think about how to fight and shoot down enemy planes alone, but should instead protect the lead aircraft well and shoot down enemies together. The Party educated him: shooting down enemy planes is important, but rescuing a comrade in battle is even more important than shooting down enemy planes. He also remembered the glorious path of the famous Soviet hero Kozhedub, who also began his record of victories in the position of a wingman. Therefore, he made a vow to the Party: "I will be a good wingman, guarantee to protect the lead aircraft well, and fight the enemy together with the lead aircraft."

    Finally, he fulfilled his vow to the Party, and began his record of combat victories in his wingman position.

    In that air battle, there were eight enemy planes and we had four. The eight enemy planes came in two groups. Our lead aircraft discovered the first group of four enemy planes and led the team straight down. The other four enemy planes quietly circled around from behind, wanting to ambush us. Han Decai looked back and saw through the enemy's trick. In order to protect the lead aircraft from continuing to attack, he immediately bravely rushed up to meet the four enemy planes. Seeing our plane coming on so fiercely, the enemies panicked for a moment, immediately losing their ability to judge and grasp the situation normally, and only wanted to escape. Our young eagle bravely chased after the enemy planes. Closer, closer, even the enemy pilot's head could be seen. Han Decai fired a burst of bullets, hitting the F-80 enemy plane squarely. The enemy plane wobbled and crashed down. Han Decai was preparing to attack the remaining three escaping enemy planes, when he looked up and saw that in his left front there was one of our planes chasing two enemy planes, and behind him, another enemy plane was biting him. Han Decai immediately remembered what the Party had taught him: "Rescuing a comrade in battle is even more important than shooting down enemy planes." He immediately turned the plane around, abandoning the original advantageous position for attacking the enemy, and switched to the difficult position of protecting his comrade. This was extremely vulnerable to enemy attack, but he willingly risked his own danger to protect his comrade. In this way, the threat of attack on the friendly aircraft was finally lifted, but at the same time, he felt the fuselage shake, and the enemy's bullets hit his plane. He quickly made a climbing sideslip, and an inspection showed that the control system had not been damaged. While he was ascending, the enemy plane attacking behind him rushed in front of him, creating an opportunity for Han Decai to attack. Seeing that it was being bitten from behind, the enemy plane dived down at a ninety-degree angle, below was the ocean. Han Decai thought: "If you dive further down, you'll be eating seawater, which would save me the trouble. When your plane tries to pull up, I'll shoot you." When the enemy plane descended to an altitude of two thousand meters, it had nowhere to go and slowly pulled up. Han Decai pressed a left bank and turned left, aimed at the enemy plane, and pressed the gun button. The enemy plane was hit and exploded, plunging into the sea.

    The news of Han Decai shooting down two planes in his first air battle reached the motherland, and he received many letters of condolence and congratulations from the people of the motherland, which gave him great encouragement. A worker in Jinzhou wrote in a letter: "Tell me, what do you need and I'll send it to you." Han Decai replied: "Thank you, dear comrade, I don't need anything, I only need to answer you with new victories."

    Sure enough, in this year's air battles, he shot down three F-86 enemy planes in a row, creating new and greater victories to answer that worker in Jinzhou, to answer the people of the motherland.

    Another time, in April, they were on patrol duty that day. With their fuel running low, he and the lead aircraft were preparing to land when the cunning enemy took the opportunity to attack. As soon as Han Decai saw this, he had just shouted to his lead aircraft, "Pull up quickly," but the enemy had already started attacking. Seeing the lead aircraft being attacked, Han Decai was both angry and anxious, his eyes burning with fire, and he immediately increased the throttle and rushed up. When the enemy wanted to launch a second attack, Han Decai's dense barrage of fire rained down on the enemy plane, and the ground anti-aircraft fire also fired, forming a fire net that surrounded the enemy plane. The enemy plane caught fire, and the enemy pilot bailed out and was captured alive by us.

    In March of this year, Han Decai honorably joined the Party. He used the victory of that battle in April as his first gift after joining the Party. Under the Party's banner, on the road to victory, he will continue to advance! (Attached picture)

    青年之鹰
    金凤
    一九五三年四月的一天晚上，中国人民志愿军空军某部驻地的一间房子里，一个被俘的美国驾驶员垂头丧气地坐在那里。这个双手沾满了朝鲜人民鲜血的空中强盗，今天出乎他意外地做了俘虏。
    一个中国人民志愿军空军年青的飞行员走了进来，他体格健壮，容光焕发，穿着飞行衣，显得一身精神。他目不转睛地把这个美国驾驶员打量了一番。
    美国驾驶员不安地转过脸去，低下头来。也许是他受不了那正义谴责的目光。也许是他更没有想到他做了这样年青的志愿军飞行员的手下败将。
    这个青年飞行员就是韩德彩，今年才二十岁。参加战斗刚一年，他已经打下五架敌机了。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府颁发的二级战士荣誉勋章，在他胸前发射着灿烂的光芒。他的青春也焕发着战斗的胜利的光彩。
    一九五二年初，贫农的儿子、青年团员韩德彩带着保卫祖国，为朝鲜人民复仇，严惩美国空中强盗的决心，驾着祖国人民捐献的飞机到了朝鲜前线。
    艰苦的战斗生活考验着他。在这里，夜里三点钟就得起床，迎着星星，顶着月亮，汽车直向机场开去。这时他常想，自己的小弟弟该早已睡熟了，母亲劳累了一天也该休息了，祖国的夜是平安的，祖国人民的梦是甜蜜的，正是为了这些，他才远离祖国在朝鲜的天空紧张地战斗着。他经常这样想着，愉快地爬进座舱；随即凝神一志，等待着战斗起飞的信号。
    为了不辜负祖国人民的希望，更好地掌握飞行技术，更狠地打击美国空中强盗，他顽强地锻炼着。他和长机驾驶员一起，在走路时，滑冰时，打球时，几乎在一切可能的场合下，都在捉摸着长机动作的特点，学习着如何更好地配合长机作战。于是，渐渐地他和长机的战斗动作变得好像一个人一样了。到了空中，只要长机的翅膀摇一摇，他就知道自己应做什么动作，常常不等长机喊“向左转”，他就加大油门，把方向盘拨向左面了。
    一次，他遇到了敌机，他全力地去打击它，但是没有战果。他急躁，他烦恼，而且晚间也不能安然入睡；他甚至怀疑作为一个僚机是不是就不能打下敌人。这时党再一次教育他：作为一个僚机飞行员，不应该只想自己如何单独作战击落敌机，而是应该很好地掩护长机，共同打下敌人。党教育他：打下敌机固然重要，但在战斗中援救一个战友，比打落敌机更重要。他又想起了著名的苏联英雄阔日杜布的光荣道路，阔日杜布也是在僚机的岗位上开始胜利的纪录的。于是，他向党立下誓言：“要当一个好僚机，保证掩护好长机，和长机一起打击敌人。”
    终于他实现了对党的誓言，在他的僚机岗位上开始了战斗胜利的纪录了。
    那一次空战，敌机八架，我们四架。敌机八架分两批袭来。我们的长机发现了第一批的四架敌机，带队直冲下去。敌人的另外四架却从后面悄悄绕过来想偷袭我们。韩德彩回头一望，识破了敌人的诡计。他为了掩护长机继续攻击，就马上勇敢地冲了上去，迎击四架敌机。敌人看到我方飞机来势甚猛，一时慌了手脚，立刻丧失了正常判断情况掌握情况的能力，只想逃命。我们的年轻的鹰，勇敢地向敌机追去。近了，近了，连敌机驾驶员的头都看见了，韩德彩猛力射出一串子弹，正中这架Ｆ八○型敌机，只见敌机摇摇晃晃地坠了下去。韩德彩正准备向其余三架逃跑的敌机攻击，这时他一抬头，只见在他的左前方有我们的一架飞机在追着两架敌机，而在他后面又被一架敌机咬上了，韩德彩马上想起党曾教导他：“在战斗中援救一个战友，比打落敌机更重要”。他随即拨转机头，放弃了原来有利的攻击敌人的位置，转到掩护战友的困难的位置上来。这是极易受到敌机攻击的，但他为了掩护战友就甘冒自己的危险了。这样友机受到攻击的威胁终于解除了，可就在同时，他觉得机身一震，敌人的子弹落到他的飞机上了，他赶忙作了一个上升侧滑，一检查操纵系统并没有受损失。而在他上升的时候，在他后面攻击的敌机一下就冲到他前面去了，这正造成韩德彩攻击的机会。敌机一看后面被咬住了，用了九十度的俯冲角度往下滑去，下面就是海洋。韩德彩心想：“你如果再钻下去就吃海水了，倒更省我的事。你的飞机要拉上来，我就打你。”敌机下降到二千公尺高度时果然走头无路又慢慢拉了上来，韩德彩压个左坡度向左转，瞄准敌机猛按炮钮，敌机中弹爆炸，栽到海里去了。
    韩德彩首次空战击落双机的消息传到祖国，他收到祖国人民很多慰劳信和祝贺信，这又给他很大鼓励。锦州一个工人的信上说：“告诉我，你需要什么东西好给你寄去。”韩德彩给他回信道：“谢谢你，亲爱的同志，我不需要什么，我只需要用新的胜利来回答你。”
    果然，在今年的空战中，他接连打下三架Ｆ八六型敌机，创造了新的更大的胜利回答了锦州的那位工人，回答了祖国人民。
    又有一次，是在四月间，那一天他们担任巡逻任务，油量快干，他和长机都准备着陆的时候，狡猾的敌人竟乘机偷袭来了。韩德彩一见，刚喊他的长机：“快拉上来”，但是敌人已经开始攻击。韩德彩一见长机遭受攻击，又气又急，两眼冒火，马上加大油门冲了上去，当敌人还想进行第二次攻击的时候，韩德彩一阵密集的炮火像阵雨一样落在敌机身上，地面高射炮火也发射了，构成一片火网包围了敌机，敌机起火了，敌机驾驶员跳伞以后也被我们生俘了。
    今年三月，韩德彩已经光荣入党。他以四月战斗的那次胜利来作为他入党后的第一次献礼。在党的旗帜下，在胜利的道路上他将继续前进！（附图片）
