The Central Ministry of Commerce held a ten-day meeting from early April, listened to reports from the heads of the commercial bureaus of major administrative regions and reports from inspection teams sent to various locations, summarized the work of the first quarter, and deployed the work for the second quarter. This meeting discussed two key issues: one was the analysis of the market situation in the first quarter and the arrangement of market work in the second quarter; the other was the implementation of the economic accounting system in state-owned commerce over the past six months, especially in the first quarter, and the deployment of implementing the economic accounting system in the second quarter.

    The Market Situation in the First Quarter

The market situation in the first quarter was normal in terms of the overall market turnover. However, after the adjustment of commerce, the revision of the tax system, and the start of the economic accounting system in state-owned commerce, there were some abnormal situations in the trade of general merchandise, fabrics, and native products, as various tasks had not been fully arranged. This was manifested in: most major native products and some minor native products were selling well, but some major native products and some minor native products were unsalable, affecting spring production and disaster relief in rural areas; general merchandise and fabrics were generally selling well, but Shanghai goods were particularly popular, while some industrial products in other large and medium-sized cities began to experience sluggish sales as the off-season approached; in the public-private ratio of market wholesale and retail trade, varying degrees of abnormal phenomena also appeared in various regions. The reasons for these situations are complex. In addition to objective reasons and some shortcomings in the work of other departments, an examination of the work of the commercial departments themselves reveals the following shortcomings in the arrangement of market work in the first quarter: First, the plan of the commercial departments to compress capital and reduce inventory in the first quarter was too tight at the beginning, so some materials that should have been purchased were not purchased in time, especially in the area of general merchandise. Second, some company manager meetings did not fully implement the policy of balancing inventory compression and market arrangement as stipulated in the National Commercial Bureau Director's Meeting in January this year. They had a one-sided understanding, isolatingly emphasizing the aspect of inventory compression and ignoring the other aspect of properly arranging the market. Third, after the implementation of the economic accounting system, the work of state-owned commerce has improved, which is the main aspect; but on the other hand, some accounting units, due to a lack of comprehensive economic accounting thinking, showed a bias towards only wanting to import Shanghai goods and not wanting to import local goods, as well as simply compressing inventory without regard to the market. Fourth, the various systems of economic accounting are not completely practical, and there were phenomena of inflexible capital allocation in January and February. In the first quarter, from the Central Ministry of Commerce, the commercial leading organs and companies at all levels focused their attention mainly on promoting the economic accounting system, and lacked sufficient research on the market. Therefore, they did not discover problems in a timely manner, correct deviations quickly and effectively, and did not do enough organizational work in the exchange of native products.

    Importance Should Be Attached to Arranging Market Work in the Second Quarter

In response to the above shortcomings of the commercial departments in arranging market work in the first quarter, the meeting decided that the national commercial departments must attach great importance to arranging market work in the second quarter and strive to overcome these shortcomings. First of all, in terms of the principle of planning, because the second quarter is a commercial off-season, commercial plans should adopt the principle of more input and more output, expanding and accelerating the turnover of goods. Funds should be mutually adjusted among companies and among various organizational links, and a reasonable inventory sufficient to cope with market supply should be maintained. Not only should the sales plan be completed, but also the purchase plan should be completed. The bias of only focusing on compressing inventory and not paying attention to arranging the market in the execution should be overcome. It was particularly pointed out that the idea of many wholesale stations being unwilling to purchase local industrial products and belittling the purchase of local industrial products that can be sold is wrong. Units with this kind of thinking and behavior do not recognize and relax the task of state-owned commerce to support production. Hardware, electrical appliances, chemicals, medicines, coal and building materials companies should seize the second quarter to expand sales and strive to over-fulfill sales tasks in order to cooperate with national industrial construction. All companies should make necessary preparations for the daily necessities needed by the people and the materials needed for basic construction in the third quarter. Secondly, prices should continue to be adjusted in the second quarter. In addition to the seasonal price difference for grain and cloth and the cotton-grain price ratio, which have already been adjusted on April 1, and the price of paper, which has already been adjusted on April 10, the seasonal price differences for other agricultural products and the prices of certain industrial products should continue to be studied and adjusted. In terms of regional price differences, reasonable and comprehensive adjustments should be made to knitwear and general merchandise based on the new situation after the implementation of the new tax system. The internal allocation prices of wholesale stations and grassroots stores at all levels should be recalculated. The principle of calculation is to calculate expenses and profits based on the standard of regional price differences that comply with policies, in order to accelerate turnover as much as possible, reduce expenses, realize the profits required by the state, and give play to the operating enthusiasm of grassroots stores for quick buying and selling, careful calculation and strict budgeting while adhering to policy principles. Third, local industrial products should be appropriately purchased and actively promoted to help industries in small and medium-sized cities and some large cities through the off-season difficulties. The principle of purchasing is: it must be in accordance with the plan and should not exceed the plan; the materials purchased should be salable, and at the very least, they should be salable in the peak season without being long-term stockpiled; the profit from operating local industrial products is lower, which will be lower than the profit from operating Shanghai industrial products, which is in line with the current economic situation. State-owned commerce must take into account the interests of producers and consumers and economic prosperity, so it should not fail to actively operate because the profit from operating local products is lower than that of Shanghai products, but it should not operate at a loss or blindly support. All state-owned commercial departments should actively help and urge local industries to reduce costs, improve product specifications, and improve quality. Fourth, vigorous promotion of native products, commercial departments must take a responsible attitude towards the promotion of native products, and oppose the bias of not caring after launching them. However, taking a responsible attitude to promote native products does not mean that everything is contracted by state-owned commerce. The correct approach is to thoroughly study the market situation of native products, understand the production and sales situation, carry out commodity ranking, rationally adjust prices, and strengthen the exchange of native products in small and medium-sized markets in order to open up the sales channels of native products as much as possible, and lead cooperatives and private commerce to actively operate native products, so that they can cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and each can get what they want. For the currently unsalable native products, local native product companies should operate, but the prices must be adjusted to be suitable for sale in the sales area in order to open up sales channels, rather than purchasing them and stockpiling them in warehouses. If the above measures are correctly implemented in the second quarter, and the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market is actively brought into play, the market situation can be further developed in a normal direction.

    Establish a Comprehensive Economic Accounting Thinking to Improve the Operation and Management of State-Owned Commerce

In terms of the implementation of the economic accounting system, this meeting summarized the situation and experience of the national commercial system in implementing the economic accounting system in the past six months, especially in the first quarter. As of early April, the commercial network prescribed by economic division and trading relationship has been largely established. Wholesale stations in the department store, hardware, electrical appliance, chemical, petroleum, grease, coal and building materials, pharmaceutical and other company systems have been established and have begun to conduct business in accordance with contractual relationships. The phenomenon of rigidly allocating commodities according to the administrative system in the past has been largely eliminated, and the phenomenon of roundabout transportation of goods has been reduced a lot. Half of the companies have held commodity supply conferences and signed contracts for the second quarter, and planning has been enhanced compared with the past. Most grassroots units of the above companies have initially verified the funds, some of which were verified from the bottom up after mass discussion (this is a minority), and some were verified from the top down by issuing control figures (this is the majority). After the units that have verified the funds, the leading cadres and the vast number of employees have begun to have a clear idea, changing the past situation of simply asking the superior for money and goods. Units that occupy too much commodity funds have begun to gradually return the debts to the bank. The phenomenon of blindly importing goods that cannot be sold at all has stopped developing. Most units have begun to use their brains and make careful calculations. Last year, grassroots units only considered how to complete sales tasks. As a result, although they sold a lot of money, played a role in activating exchanges and leading the market, they did not know whether they were making or losing money, and the losses were huge. After asset verification, many units began to feel a heavy responsibility. They had to complete the commodity turnover plan, the financial plan, and master the price policy. If the price is set too high, it will not be sold, and the leading role of state-owned commerce will be lost. If the price is set too low, it will lose money. Many managers feel that their skills are poor and the work is not easy to do. Especially in the process of asset verification, combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, units that have done a good job have exposed many of the past shortcomings, making cadres and employees realize that the past operation and management was too poor and caused a lot of losses to the country, which has raised everyone's awareness. This is a new look that has emerged after the commercial system began to implement the economic accounting system. It shows that the economic accounting system has an important and positive role in improving the work of state-owned commerce.

At present, the shortcomings in the implementation of the economic accounting system are, first of all, that the ideological foundation is not completely consolidated, and the supply system thinking of relying on superiors and not making careful calculations has not been completely overcome. Some units did not mobilize the masses in the process of asset verification. Therefore, after the implementation of economic accounting, although the system has changed, there are still old practices, not proactive, not active, waiting, relying. If the goods are short, they don't think of ways to buy them. If others owe money, they don't actively ask for it. If there is money in the bank, they don't know how to turn it around. These phenomena still exist in a considerable number of units. In addition, the comprehensive economic accounting thinking has not yet been clearly established. Many units believe that the economic accounting system is a one-sided compression of inventory, so they only pay attention to selling, not paying attention to buying, afraid of stockpiling, not afraid of out of stock, only paying attention to accelerating turnover, not paying attention to expanding circulation. Some wholesale stations even want to turn themselves into trust companies, and don't even want a reasonable inventory, forgetting the responsibility of supporting production. They are unwilling to operate goods that make less money, only willing to buy good-selling branded goods, and unwilling to buy local goods. Second, some systems and methods are not completely practical, the regulations are not specific enough, the requirements are too strict, and the procedures are too complicated, while the financial accounting personnel lack training, which has caused a period of confusion. Third, the connection between various links within the organization and between various organizations is not close, so there are still phenomena of disconnection. Many wholesale stations, due to the lack of ideas to accelerate commodity circulation and the lack of ideas to rely on the masses in the arrangement of organizational structure, only passively considered preventing loopholes and preventing corruption, so the procedures are too complicated, the system is unreasonable, and each commodity needs more than a dozen procedures for warehousing and outgoing, and more than a hundred stamps to be completed in ten days. Many companies have also affected the commodity circulation because they failed to hold supply meetings and sign contracts in time after changing the contract relationship. These shortcomings need to be improved in a led and step-by-step manner.

The experience of implementing the economic accounting system in the past six months, especially since the first quarter, has proved that the implementation of the economic accounting system is a basic method to improve the operation and management of state-owned commerce and improve the quality of work. The economic accounting system must be resolutely and correctly implemented, otherwise state-owned commerce will not be able to assume its tasks in economic construction. The shortcomings in the implementation of the economic accounting system are not the shortcomings of the economic accounting system itself, but the shortcomings in leadership and execution. The implementation of the economic accounting system has proved that it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership, mobilize the masses, and mobilize all employees to be actively responsible in order to correctly implement it. Because this is a major reform of state-owned commerce in terms of ideology, organization, and system, it is first necessary to carry out full ideological mobilization, mobilize the masses, and specifically and deeply criticize the supply system thinking and bureaucracy, and establish a comprehensive economic accounting thinking. Some of the chaotic phenomena formed in the implementation of the economic accounting system in the first quarter, insufficient ideological leadership, and insufficient mobilization of the masses were a major reason. In addition, experience has proved that the systems and methods must be practical, specific, and clear. On the one hand, there must be unified general regulations, and on the other hand, it is necessary to mobilize various regions and grassroots units to create practical and feasible methods according to the specific conditions of the enterprise and the region, summarize them at any time, gradually promote them, and adopt typical experiments, organize visits, and conduct learning methods to properly arrange the implementation steps. From the current situation, the steps required at the January meeting of the Commercial Bureau Director to fully implement the economic accounting system on April 1 were a bit too hasty and must be appropriately slowed down.

    The Implementation of Economic Accounting Must Be Combined with the Arrangement of the Market

In terms of future practices, the meeting decided to re-arrange the steps for implementing the economic accounting system, and to postpone the implementation of economic accounting by local trade companies, local native product companies, monopoly companies, and retail companies outside of Northeast China to the third quarter, and to pay attention to preparing for various economic accounting. Other professional companies generally complete the task by the end of June. Units that have been decentralized must quickly mobilize the masses, discuss commodity circulation plans and financial plans, check and calculate prices from both policy and business management aspects, and revise and verify the control figures for funds. The meeting focused on discussing how the commercial departments can implement a comprehensive economic accounting thinking, and stipulated that the specific content of the comprehensive economic accounting thinking is: "Rely on employees, be careful in budgeting, scientific management, understand production and sales, expand circulation, accelerate turnover, reduce expenses, calculate profits and losses, implement policies, and complete plans." It is necessary to conduct extensive publicity and interpretation of the comprehensive economic accounting thinking among all employees, so that the vast number of employees understand the interests of the country and the people in implementing the economic accounting system, understand the status and role of state-owned commerce, and improve ideological awareness and policy level. The current focus of publicity is to point out that economic accounting must be combined with market arrangement, and to explain that the purpose of implementing the economic accounting system is to better implement policies, so policies must be implemented and plans must be completed, and plans must be gradually adapted to reality and correctly reflect policies. It is necessary to further expose the shortcomings and supply system thinking in the work through the struggle against bureaucracy, against commandism, and against violations of laws and disciplines, and at the same time carry out ideological education on the comprehensive economic accounting system, so that all employees can not only see the shortcomings, but also see the direction of efforts. After the anti-bureaucracy struggle and the construction stage, the business units can launch labor emulation campaigns and prepare to launch a national-scale labor emulation campaign starting from the third quarter. In addition, at the meeting, the successful experiences of implementing the economic accounting system in the first quarter, such as the Second National Supply Conference held by China Department Store Company in Shanghai, and the sales representative meetings held in Handan, Xuchang, Luohe, Jinan and other places, were summarized, and it was decided that these advanced experiences and other more successful experiences would be promoted in a led and step-by-step manner in the second quarter in combination with the actual conditions of various places. And it is planned to carry out several new typical experiments to improve the economic accounting system in the second quarter. The general goal of state-owned commerce in the second quarter in implementing the economic accounting system is: requiring all professional companies, except local trade companies, native product companies, retail companies, and monopoly companies, to basically ensure that all asset verification units mobilize the masses, discuss plans, and connect well with enterprises up and down by the end of June. They should be able to normally buy and sell, settle accounts, and simplify the procedures for enterprises to enter and leave the warehouse, so that it generally does not exceed two days. And it is required that in the third quarter, in addition to clarifying the existing inventory of goods, there will be no more chaos in the future.

Xinhua News Agency The major administrative regions are now convening the Commercial Bureau Director's Conference of their respective regions based on the second-quarter work deployment of the Central Ministry of Commerce to discuss how to implement it. The Central Ministry of Commerce has transferred more than 280 cadres from the headquarters and various general companies to set off in early May and conduct a large-scale inspection again.

### 中央商业部布置国营商业第二季度工作

    中央商业部布置国营商业第二季度工作
    中央商业部从四月上旬起，开了十天会议，听取了各大行政区商业管理局局长的汇报和派到各地的检查小组的汇报，总结了第一季度的工作，并布置了第二季度的工作。这次会议讨论了两个重点问题：一个是第一季度市场情况的分析和第二季度安排市场的工作；另一个是半年来特别是第一季度国营商业实行经济核算制的情况和第二季度贯彻经济核算制的布置。
    第一季度的市场情况
    第一季度的市场情况，从总的市场营业额来看，是正常的。但在调整商业、税制修正和国营商业开始实行经济核算制以后，由于各种工作还没有完全安排妥当，因此在百货、布匹和土产的贸易方面，还存在着一些不完全正常的状况。表现在：大部分主要土产和一部分小土产是旺销的，但还有小部分主要土产和一部分小土产滞销，影响着农村的春季生产和救灾；百货与布匹一般是畅销的，但其中上海货销路特别畅旺，其他大城市和中小城市的一部分工业品则在淡季来临时，开始出现了滞销局面；在市场批发贸易与零售贸易的公私比重上，各地也出现了一些程度不同的不正常现象。造成这些情况的原因很复杂，除了客观原因和其他部门工作上的若干缺点以外，从商业部门本身的工作来检查，在第一季度安排市场的工作上，存在着以下几个缺点：第一，第一季度商业部门压缩资金减少库存的计划，在开始时过紧了一些，因此有些应当收购的物资没有及时收购，尤其是百货方面。第二，有些公司经理会议没有完全贯彻今年一月全国商业厅局长会议规定的压缩库存与安排市场并重的方针，了解片面，孤立地强调了压缩库存的一面，忽视了必需妥善安排市场的另一面。第三，在实行经济核算制以后，国营商业的工作有所改进，这是主要的；但在另一方面，则有些核算单位由于缺乏全面的经济核算思想，产生了只愿进上海货，不愿进当地货，以及单纯压缩库存不顾市场的偏向。第四，经济核算的各项制度，还不完全切合实际，在一月、二月份中还有资金调度不灵的现象。在第一季度中，从中央商业部起，各级商业领导机关和公司都把注意力主要放在推行经济核算制上，对市场的研究不足，因此发现问题不够及时，纠正偏差不迅速有力，在土产交流上也没有做足够的组织工作。
    第二季度要重视安排市场的工作
    针对着商业部门在第一季度安排市场工作中的上述缺点，会议决定了全国商业部门必须在第二季度中十分重视安排市场的工作，并努力克服这些缺点。首先，在计划的原则上，因为第二季度是商业淡季，商业计划应采取多进多出，扩大加速商品流转的原则，在各公司间和各组织环节间互相调剂资金，要保持合理的足够应付市场供应的库存。不仅要完成销售计划，而且要完成收购计划。克服在执行中只顾压缩库存而不重视安排市场的偏向，特别指出有不少批发站对当地工业产品不愿意进货，轻视收购能销售的当地工业产品的思想是不对的，有这种思想和行为的单位就是不认识和放松国营商业扶助生产的任务。五金、交电、化工、医药、煤建等公司要抓紧第二季度开展销售，争取超计划完成销售任务，以配合国家工业建设。各公司对于第三季度人民生活日用品和基本建设需要的物资，都要进行必要的准备。其次，在第二季度中应当继续调整价格，除粮布季节差价、棉粮比价已经在四月一日调整，纸张价格已经在四月十日调整外，其他农产品的季节差价和某几种工业品的价格还要继续研究调整。在地区差价方面，应根据新税制实行后的新情况，对针织品与百货进行合理的、全面的调整。各级批发站与基层商店的内部调拨价要重新计算，计算的原则是以符合政策的地区差价为标准的基础上来计算费用与利润，以求在服从政策的原则下尽可能加速周转，降低费用，实现国家要求的利润并发挥基层商店快买快卖，精打细算的经营积极性。第三，适当收购与积极推销地方工业产品，帮助中小城市与部分大城市的工业度过淡季困难。收购的原则是：必需按照计划，不应突破计划；收购的物资应当是有销路的，最低限度应当是在旺季可以销售而不致长期积压的；经营地方工业产品的利润是较低的，会低于经营上海工业品的利润，这是符合于目前经济情况的，国营商业必须照顾到生产者、消费者的利益与繁荣经济，因此不应因经营地方产品利润低于上海产品而不去积极经营，但亦不应赔本经营，盲目扶植，一切国营商业部门应当积极帮助督促地方工业降低成本，改善产品规格，提高质量。第四，大力推销土产，商业部门对土产的推销必须采取负责态度，反对推出门不管的偏向。但采取负责态度推销土产并不是一切都由国营商业包下来。正确的作法是深入研究土产市场的情况，摸清产销状况，进行商品排队，合理调整价格，加强领导中小市场的土产交流会，以求尽可能打开土产销路，并领导合作社与私营商业积极经营土产，使他们在国营经济的领导下，分工合作，各得其所。目前滞销的土产，各地土产公司应当经营，但价格必须调整到适合销地出售，以便打开销路，而不是收购起来积压在仓库里。在第二季度中如果正确地执行了以上几个措施，积极发挥国营商业对市场的领导作用，就可以使市场情况进一步向着正常的方向发展。
    树立全面的经济核算思想改善国营商业的经营管理
    在实行经济核算制方面，这次会议总结了半年以来特别是第一季度中全国商业系统实行经济核算制的情况与经验。到四月初为止，按经济区划与买卖关系所规定的商业网已大部分建立了。百货、五金、交电、化工、石油、油脂、煤建、医药等公司系统的批发站已经建立了，并已开始按合同关系进行业务。过去按行政系统硬性调拨商品的现象已经大部分取消了，商品迂回运输的现象已经减少了很多，半数公司开过了商品供应会议，签订了第二季度合同，计划性比过去增强了一些。上述公司大部分基层单位初步核定了资金，有的是自下而上，经过群众讨论核定的（这是少数），有的是自上而下，下达控制数字核定的（这是多数）。经过核定资金的单位，领导干部与广大职工已开始心中有数，改变了过去那种单纯向上级要钱要货的情况。占用商品资金过多的单位已开始陆续向银行归还欠款。盲目进那种根本不能销售的货品的现象已经停止发展。多数单位已开始动脑筋，算细账。去年各基层单位只考虑如何完成销售任务，结果虽然卖了不少钱，在活跃交流、领导市场上起了作用，但不知赔赚，损失很大。核资以后，不少单位开始感觉责任重大，既要完成商品流转计划，又要完成财务计划，又要掌握好价格政策。价格定高了卖不出去，失去了国营商业的领导作用，定低了就会赔钱。许多经理感到本领差，工作不好做了。尤其是在核资过程中，结合了反官僚主义斗争，做得好的单位把过去的缺点暴露了很多，使干部和职工认识到过去的经营管理太差，给国家造成了不少损失，使大家提高了觉悟。这是在商业系统开始实行经济核算制以后出现了的新面貌，它说明经济核算制对于改进国营商业的工作具有重要的积极的作用。
    目前在实行经济核算制工作中存在的缺点，首先是思想基础还不完全巩固，依赖上级，不算细账的供给制思想尚未彻底克服。有的单位在核资过程中，没有发动群众。所以在实行经济核算以后，制度虽然改变了，但还存在着老作法，不主动、不积极、等待、依赖。货缺了，不想办法买。别人欠了钱，不去积极要。银行存了款，不知道设法周转。这些现象在相当多的单位中依然存在。此外，全面的经济核算思想还未明确树立，有不少单位以为经济核算制是片面的压缩库存，所以只注意卖，不注意买，怕积压，不怕脱销，只注意加速周转，不注意扩大流转。有的批发站甚至于想把自己变成信托公司，连合理库存都不想要，忘记了扶助生产的责任。对赚钱少的商品，不愿意经营，只愿意买好卖的名牌货，不愿意买本地货。第二，若干制度办法还不完全切合实际，规定得不够具体，要求得过分严格，手续过分复杂，而对财务会计人员，又缺乏训练，因此就造成了一度的混乱。第三，组织内部各个环节之间，各个组织之间衔接不密切，因此还有脱节的现象。不少批发站由于对组织机构的安排，缺乏加速商品流转的思想和依靠群众的思想，只消极地考虑了防止漏洞，防备贪污，所以手续过分繁杂，制度不合理，商品出库入库各需十几道手续，盖一百多个图章，十几天才能办好。还有不少企业在改变合同关系以后，由于未能及时开好供应会议，订好合同，也影响了商品流转。这些缺点都有待于有领导地、有步骤地加以改进。
    半年来，特别是第一季度以来实行经济核算制的经验，证明了实行经济核算制是改善国营商业的经营管理，提高工作质量的基本方法。必须坚决地、正确地贯彻经济核算制，否则国营商业就不能担负起在经济建设中的任务。实行经济核算制中的缺点，并不是经济核算制本身的缺点，而是领导与执行中的缺点。实行经济核算制证明了必需加强思想领导，发动群众，动员全体职工积极负责才能正确贯彻。因为这是国营商业在思想上、组织上、制度上的一个重大改革，首先必须进行充分的思想动员，必须发动群众，必须具体深入地批判供给制思想与官僚主义，必须树立全面的经济核算思想。第一季度在实行经济核算制中形成的一些混乱现象，思想领导不足，发动群众不够，是一个主要的原因。此外，经验证明了在制度办法上必须切合实际、具体、明确，一方面要有统一的一般规定，另一方面又要发动各地区与各基层单位，根据本企业本地区的具体情况创造切实可行的办法，随时总结，逐步推广，并采取典型试验，组织参观，进行学习的办法，妥善安排实施步骤。从目前情况看来，在一月商业厅局长会议上要求在四月一日全部实行经济核算制的步骤，是稍急了一些，必须适当放缓。
    实行经济核算必须与安排市场相结合
    在今后的作法上，会议决定重新安排实施经济核算制的步骤，把地方贸易公司、地方土产公司、专卖公司和东北地区以外的零售公司实行经济核算的工作，推迟到第三季度进行，并注意做好各种经济核算的准备工作，其他各专业公司一般都在六月底基本完成。资金已经下放的单位必须迅速发动群众，讨论商品流转计划与财务计划，从政策与经营管理两方面来检查与计算价格，并修订核定资金的控制数字。会议着重讨论了商业部门如何贯彻全面的经济核算思想，并规定全面的经济核算思想的具体内容是：“依靠职工、精打细算、科学管理、摸清产销、扩大流通、加速周转、降低费用、计算盈亏、贯彻政策、完成计划”。必须将全面的经济核算思想在全体职工中进行广泛的宣传解释，使广大职工了解实行经济核算制对于国家与人民的利益，了解国营商业的地位与作用，提高思想觉悟与政策水平。当前宣传的重点，是指出经济核算必须与安排市场相结合，说明实行经济核算制的目的，是为了更好地执行政策，因此必须贯彻政策，完成计划，并使计划逐步切合实际，正确体现政策。必须通过反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，进一步揭发工作中的缺点与供给制思想，同时进行全面的经济核算制的思想教育，使全体职工不仅看到缺点，还能看到努力方向。经过反官僚主义斗争及建设阶段以后的企业单位，可以开展劳动竞赛并准备从第三季度开始展开全国规模的劳动竞赛运动。此外，在会议上，总结了第一季度实行经济核算制的几个成功经验，如中国百货公司在上海召开的第二届全国供应会议，邯郸、许昌、漯河、济南等地召开的营业员代表会议等，并决定对这些先进经验和其他较为成功的经验在第二季度中，有领导地、有步骤地结合各地实际情况加以推广。并准备在第二季度中再进行改进经济核算制工作的几个新的典型试验。第二季度国营商业实行经济核算制的总目标是：要求各专业公司除地方贸易公司、土产公司、零售公司和专卖公司外，到六月底为止，大体上做到一切核资单位发动了群众，讨论了计划，企业间上下衔接好，能够正常买卖，结算、简化各企业出入库的手续使一般不超过两天时间。并要求在第三季度中作到除了把现有的库存商品弄清之外，以后不致再乱。
    现在各大行政区正在根据中央商业部第二季度工作布置召开本区商业厅长会议，讨论如何贯彻执行。中央商业部已抽调本部及各总公司干部二百八十余人，在五月初出发，再度进行大规模的检查工作。（新华社）
