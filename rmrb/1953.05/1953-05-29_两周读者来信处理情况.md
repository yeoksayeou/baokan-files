Two Weeks of Reader's Letters Processing Status

From May 11th to May 23rd, the reader's letters group of this newspaper received a total of 3,268 reader's letters, and various agencies replied to 782 reader's letters. Among them, 1,472 were related to political and legal issues, 1,109 were related to cultural and educational issues, 1,418 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, and 51 were of other nature. Eighty-seven letters were published in this newspaper, 1,185 were individually answered to the readers, 2,133 were transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, processing, reply, or reference, and 1,280 were kept for reference by this newspaper and did not require further processing; some of these were letters left over from the past. During this period, the reader's letters group of this newspaper sent out a total of 4,880 replies to readers, letters transferring requests to various agencies for investigation and processing, and follow-up letters. In addition, there were 561 letters from families of revolutionary soldiers looking for revolutionary soldiers, which were not included in the statistics.

In these two weeks, many readers' letters reflected some problems in the pilot work of universal suffrage in various localities, such as the deviation in Zhangming County, Sichuan Province, where universal suffrage was not closely integrated with production during the pilot work of universal suffrage. We are studying these letters and hope that the general readers will write to reflect the situation in this regard. Some readers' letters reflect some new atmospheres after the marriage law publicity month in various localities, and we are preparing to excerpt some of them for publication.

In the letters concerning industrial production, readers exposed the neglect of safe production in Jixi Mining Bureau Didao Coal Mine, Southwest State-owned 401 Coal Mine, etc.; and exposed the low quality of products in some factories. We are studying these letters and preparing to select some for publication.

In the letters concerning rural work, readers reflected the situation and problems in rural drought resistance to protect seedlings, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and summer harvesting; reflected the continuous occurrence of mountain fires or indiscriminate logging in mountainous areas of Songjiang, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Hebei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces this spring; reflected the experience and problems of rural cadres in leading production work; reflected some deviations in the supply of means of production and means of livelihood by rural cooperative organizations; and reflected the overly complicated procedures in the tea procurement work in Anhua County, Hunan Province, which caused dissatisfaction among farmers. We will select some of the above letters for publication, and the rest will be handled individually.

In the letters concerning transportation, transportation, and postal services, some readers criticized the shortcomings of certain railway units in charge of transportation work, and we have selected some for publication; readers continued to expose delays and errors in mail delivery and reflected the traffic order problems in some cities, and we have transferred them to relevant agencies for handling.

In addition, readers reflected the situation of some enterprises and institutions having virtual institutions and wasting manpower, which is a very important issue, and we are studying it. We are also studying the letters reflecting the failure of some industrial and mining units to provide assistance and guidance to engineering students who come for internships, and the letters reflecting the continued influx of farmers into cities blindly after the State Council's instructions on dissuading farmers from blindly flowing into cities were announced.

    这两周中，有不少读者来信反映当地普选重点试办工作中的一些问题，如四川省彰明县在普选试办工作中曾发生普选没有与生产密切结合的偏向。我们正研究这些来信，并且希望广大读者来信反映这方面的情况。有一部分读者来信反映当地贯彻婚姻法运动月以后的一些新气象，我们准备摘发一部分。
    在有关工业生产的来信中，读者揭发了鸡西矿务局滴道煤矿、西南国营四零一煤矿等忽视安全生产的情况；揭发了某些工厂产品质量低劣的情况。这些来信，我们正在研究，准备选择发表。
