Reader's Letters Summary

    The Beijing Industrial School's Educational Policy is Unclear
    A letter from Jiang Yongle, Zhang Shaoping, and 27 other teachers from the Beijing Industrial School: Our Beijing Industrial School is a comprehensive technical school with a history of over 40 years, and has always practiced general education. Now our school is under the dual leadership of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Local Industry and the Education Bureau, and cultivates middle-level technical talents for various factories in Beijing. The school has more than 1,000 students and offers three departments: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering. The scope of each department is very broad, and the courses are complex and cannot be specialized. For example, in the Mechanical Engineering Department, in addition to learning basic technical courses in three years, students also have to study drafting, mechanical design, metallography, and work methods (including machine tools, foundry, fitter, etc.), steam power engines, and internal combustion engines. As a result, students know a little about everything, but are not specialized in any one thing. After we raised our opinions, the Local Industry Bureau agreed to add specialized courses. So, we added "Pharmaceuticals," "Civil Machinery," "Chemical Machinery," and "Textile Machinery." As a result, "Civil Machinery," "Chemical Machinery," and "Textile Machinery" were discontinued midway due to the lack of need for a large number of cadres in these fields. In addition, in order to adapt to the temporary needs of Beijing, some courses in our school are often changed every semester, making teachers rushed and students at a loss. Due to the unclear training policy, 70% of the students cannot master technical work after graduation. Some do administrative work, and some do clerical work, which is a serious loss. After repeatedly studying the situation of our school, we deeply feel that in order to run our school well, we must determine the direction of specialization, carry out consistent and planned teaching, simplify and concentrate the courses, and make the training objectives clearer. We suggest that the Central Higher Education Department consider our suggestions and make an adjustment so that our school can more reasonably and effectively train middle-level technical personnel to meet the needs of the country's large-scale construction.
    Editor's Note: We have also received six letters from teachers and students of the school, Shen Lin, Liang Shugang, etc. Because the content is roughly the same, they will no longer be published.

    Shandong University Has Too Many Administrative Staff
    A letter from Yao Chi of the Personnel Section of Shandong University: Shandong University has more than 1,500 students, but there are 183 staff members, in addition to 28 political work cadres. According to the standard of one staff member for every 25 students, the number of staff members in our school should be 61, which is now exceeded by 122. This is a serious waste of manpower. For example, the Academic Affairs Office has two provosts, three chief secretaries, and a secretary. Ma Lianheng, a staff member of the Department of Aquaculture, goes to sea once every six months, and spends most of the rest of his time doing labor protection work for the trade union. Some archivists are idle all day knitting sweaters. Some typists only type four mimeograph stencils a day. However, many schools are forced to replace technical personnel due to the lack of general administrative staff, while many people in our school are idle, which is a serious irrational phenomenon. The reason for this situation is related to the lack of organization and discipline in our school's personnel work. For example, after the summer vacation in 1952, our school employed about 20 staff members without the approval of the higher authorities, and it was not an isolated case to employ unqualified personnel simply to take care of cadres' families. Although the school leaders have initially paid attention to this problem this semester, such as the Party Committee's work plan mentioning the issue of fixed staffing and quotas, and the administrative side has also decided not to increase staff, they have not proposed effective ways to improve the current situation. At the same time, some administrative cadres in the school still arbitrarily ask for people or are unwilling to make adjustments regardless of the number of people. I think that the East China Higher Education Bureau should help solve this problem.

    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Should Correct the Practice of Issuing Conflicting Orders and Messing Up Instructions
    A letter from Li Wen, a student of the Subei Canal Normal School: A class of students from our Subei Canal Normal School was originally scheduled to graduate in the spring of 1954. In the spring of 1952, the original Subei Cultural and Educational Office notified our school that due to the needs of the motherland, our class decided to graduate half a year earlier in the summer vacation of 1953 (ie, this semester). The students unconditionally obeyed the call of the motherland and actively studied their lessons with a revolutionary spirit. In the fourth week after the start of school this year, our school received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, saying that due to changes in the situation, it was decided that our class would still graduate in the spring of next year. This decision disrupted the study plans of our students and the teaching plans of the teachers. However, we felt that the interests of the country were higher than the plans of our school, and quickly stabilized our emotions and re-formulated the teaching plan. Unexpectedly, in the second week after receiving the previous notice, our school received another notice from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, saying that our class should still graduate half a year earlier. The learning enthusiasm of some of our students was very uneasy, but everyone still obeyed the instructions of the Department of Education and actively prepared for graduation again. But after about two months, our graduation preparations were almost completed, and the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education changed its decision again, letting us still graduate in 1954. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's practice of issuing conflicting orders and messing up instructions disrupted our teaching work. This situation has also occurred when the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education arranged other work. Therefore, I hope that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education can conduct an inspection and quickly correct this unserious work style.

    The Cultural and Educational Departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Should Solve the Problem of Timely Supply of Mongolian Textbooks
    A letter from the Cultural and Educational Section of the People's Government of the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: There are 24,000 students in the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin, including 17,000 Mongolian students. Since 1950, Mongolian textbooks have not been issued in time every year, which has seriously affected teaching work. In the first semester of 1950, Mongolian textbooks were received only when the summer vacation was about to begin; the textbooks for the second semester were delayed until mid-October; in 1951, when Mongolian textbooks were distributed to the Xinhua Bookstore in our banner, the school had been in session for three months; the situation was the same last year, and this year the school has been in session for nearly two months, and Mongolian textbooks are still nowhere to be seen. For this reason, we have sent letters and telegrams to the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House and the Mongolian and Sui Branch of the Xinhua Bookstore to urge them, and sent a letter to the Cultural and Educational Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but the problem has not been resolved as of April 15. Now that new textbooks cannot be supplied in time, all schools are reviewing with old textbooks. This has a great impact on planned teaching and also makes Mongolian students and their parents feel dissatisfied. We hope that the Cultural and Educational Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will quickly solve this problem.

    Yinxian County's Agencies Conduct Anti-Bureaucracy Struggle by Inspecting and Handling People's Letters
    A letter from reader Yao Kezhang: Recently, county-level agencies in Yinxian County, Zhejiang Province, launched a mass anti-bureaucracy struggle centered on inspecting and handling people's letters, and have achieved preliminary results.
    In the past, the county people's government and other units were very irresponsible in dealing with people's letters. According to statistics for the year and a half after June 1951 alone, county agencies had a backlog of 1,325 letters from the people, of which the county people's government had the most, with 673. Among the people's letters backloged by the county people's government, 87 had not been answered or dealt with for more than a year. For example, Huang Hantang, a small vendor from Jia Village Township in the county, went to the county to register four times (45 li each time) before and after August 1951. The cadres of the Industry and Commerce Section of the county people's government considered it a "small matter" and said that it had expired, and resolutely refused to register. Huang Hantang went home in tears and cried with his wife and children. The next day, he wrote a very sincere letter to the county magistrate, asking for a solution to the problem. However, this letter was not even opened by the Secretariat of the county people's government and was placed at the bottom of the cabinet for 16 months before being discovered during this cleanup. Another example is the letter from Xin Kangyu of Dagong Township in the county, exposing the manipulation of village power by bad elements and the confusion of township cadres and suppressing the working people. Although the county people's government attached great importance to it and copied it to the district chief for investigation, the district chief turned the copy to the county party committee, and the county party committee turned it to the county people's government, which went back to the district chief in a circle; later, no one cared about it, and it was not dealt with until this inspection, and the copy was also lost. Zhou Lunlin, the village chief of Yanxia Village in Zhangshui District of the county, was retaliated against by bad elements and bad cadres. He went back and forth 100 li and went to the county 14 times to find the chief of the Industry and Commerce Section (because the chief had served as the district chief of Zhangshui District) to appeal, but he never got a reply. When he went to the county for the 15th time, he happened to meet Sunday and was refused to be seen again. He then questioned: "Does the Communist Party want the common people?" The guard rudely replied: "Hah! The victory of the Communist Party, does it depend on you alone!" And forced him to go back.
    In response to this situation, the county combined the handling of major events, revised the agency system, and established people's opinion boxes and registration and follow-up systems for handling people's letters. In order to thoroughly change the work style of the agencies, the Yinxian County Party Committee made a report at the expanded meeting of county and district cadres based on the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee's instructions on studying the "Huang Yifeng Incident," calling on everyone to resolutely carry out the movement against bureaucracy, against coercion and command, against violation of laws and regulations, and against suppression of criticism more deeply and widely.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    北京工业学校办学方针不明确
    北京工业学校教员江永乐、张少平等二十七人来信：我们北京工业学校是一个有四十多年历史的综合性技术学校，过去一贯实行通才教育。现在我校属北京市地方工业局和教育局双重领导，为北京市属各工厂培养中等技术人才。全校有一千多个学生，共设电机、机械和化工三科；各科范围很广，课程繁复，无法专门。如机械科在三年中除了学基础性的技术课外，还要学制图、机械设计、金相学和工作法（包括工具机、铸工、钳工等）、蒸气动力机和内燃机等课程，因此弄得学生什么都懂得一些，但没有一项专门。经我们提出意见后，地方工业局同意我们添设专业课。于是增加了“制药”、
    “土木机械”、“化工机械”和“纺织机械”四课；结果“土木机械”、“化工机械”和“纺织机械”都因不需要很多这方面的干部等原因而中途停开了。另外，我校为了适应北京一时的需要，有些课程往往一学期一更换，弄得教师手忙脚乱，学生无所适从。由于培养方针不明确，学生毕业后十分之七不能掌握技术工作。有的作行政工作，有的作事务工作，这是严重的损失。我们反复研究了我校情况之后，深切地感到要办好我们的学校，必须确定专业化方向，进行一贯的有计划的教学，使课程精简集中，培养目标更明确起来。我们建议中央高等教育部考虑我们的建议，作一次调整，以使我校能更合理而有效地培养中等技术人材，来满足国家大规模建设的需要。
    编者按：我们同时还收到该校师生沈麟、梁树刚等人的来信六件，因内容大致相同，故不再发表。
    山东大学行政工作人员过多
    山东大学人事科姚池来信：山东大学共有学生一千五百余人，而职员却有一百八十三人之多，此外有政治工作干部二十八人。按学生二十五人职员一人的标准计算，我校职员人数应为六十一人，现已超过一二二人。这是严重的人力浪费。如教务处有了两个教务长，三个主任秘书，还设了一个秘书。水产系职员马连衡半年下一次海，其他时间多半做工会的劳保工作。有的资料员整天闲着打毛衣。有的打字员一天只打四张腊纸。但不少学校却因缺乏一般行政工作人员而被迫以技术人员来代替，我校则不少人空闲无事，这是严重的不合理现象。造成这种情况的原因和我校人事工作中的无组织无纪律情况是有关系的。如一九五二年暑假后，我校未经上级批准而任用了约二十几个职员，其他单纯为了照顾干部家属而任用不能称职的人员也不是个别的。这学期学校领导方面虽已初步重视了这个问题，如党委会的工作计划中已提到定员定额问题，行政方面也已确定不再增加职员；但他们对如何改进目前情况却没提出有效办法。同时，校内仍有一些行政干部不管人数多少而任意要人或不愿调整。我认为：华东高等教育局应该协助解决这个问题。
    江苏省教育厅应该纠正朝令夕改乱下指示的做法
    苏北运河师范学校学生李文来信：我们苏北运河师范学校有一班同学原应在一九五四年春季毕业。一九五二年春，原苏北文教处通知我校，由于祖国需要，我班决定提早半年在一九五三年暑假（即本学期）毕业。同学都无条件地服从了祖国的号召，以革命的精神来积极学习功课。今年开学后的第四周，我校接到了江苏省教育厅的命令，说是因为情况变化，决定我班仍在明年春季毕业。这个决定打乱了我们同学的学习计划和老师的教学计划。但我们感到国家的利益高于我们一校的计划，很快安定了情绪，重新拟订教学计划。不料在接到前个通知后的第二周，我校又接到了江苏省教育厅的通知，仍要我班提早半年毕业。我们有些同学的学习情绪很不安，但大家还是服从教育厅的指示，积极再做毕业的准备。但又过了约两个月，我们毕业的准备工作快做好了，江苏省教育厅又改变决定。让我们仍在一九五四年毕业。江苏省教育厅这种朝令夕改地乱下指示，使我们的教学工作发生了紊乱。这种情形在江苏省教育厅布置其它工作时也曾发生过。因此，我希望江苏省教育厅能够进行一次检查，并迅速纠正这种不严肃的工作作风。
    内蒙古自治区文教部门应解决蒙文教科书的及时供应问题
    内蒙古自治区科尔沁左翼中旗人民政府文教科来信：科尔沁左翼中旗共有学生二万四千名，其中蒙族学生一万七千名。自一九五○年以来，蒙文教科书年年不能及时发下，严重影响了教学工作。一九五○年上学期蒙文教科书到快放暑假时才收到；下学期的教科书则拖到十月中旬才收到；一九五一年蒙文教科书发到本旗新华书店时，学校已开学三个月；去年的情况也是如此，今年学校已开学将近两月，蒙文教科书还是没影。为此，我们曾用书信、电报分别向内蒙人民出版社、新华书店蒙绥分店催问，并给内蒙古自治区人民政府文教部去信，但到四月十五日，问题仍未解决。现在各校因新的教科书不能及时供应，均以旧教材进行复习。这对有计划的教学影响是很大的，并且也使蒙族学生和他们的家长感到不满。我们希望内蒙古自治区人民政府文教部迅速解决这个问题。
    鄞县各机关检查处理人民来信工作开展反官僚主义斗争
    读者姚克章来信：最近，浙江省鄞县县级各机关开展了以检查处理人民来信工作为中心的群众性的反官僚主义斗争，并已获得了初步成绩。
    县人民政府等单位过去对待人民来信很不负责任。仅据一九五一年六月以后一年半的统计，县里各机关共积压了一千三百二十五件人民来信，其中县人民政府最多，计六百七十三件。县人民政府所积压的人民来信，有八十七件是在一年以上未曾答复或未作处理的。如该县甲村乡小商贩黄汉堂于一九五一年八月以前先后四次（每次往返四十五里）到县里办理登记，县人民政府工商科干部认为是“小事情”，并说已过期，坚决拒绝登记。黄汉堂含泪回家和妻儿相对哭泣，第二天他又很恳切地写了一封信给县长，要求解决问题。但这封信被县人民政府秘书室连拆也没有拆地放在橱底压了十六个月，到这一次清理时才发现。又如该县大公乡忻康裕揭发坏分子操纵村政权、迷糊乡干部并打击劳动人民的来信，县人民政府虽较重视，把它抄给所属区长查处，但区长又把抄件转县委，县委再转给县人民政府，绕了一个圈子还是交给区长；后来，大家都不管不问，直到这次检查时还没有处理，并且那抄件也没了。该县章水区岩下村村长周伦林被坏分子、坏干部报复打击，曾经来回一百里、往返十四次到县里找工商科科长（因该科长曾任章水区区长）申诉，但始终没有得到处理。当他第十五次到县里，恰遇星期日，又被拒绝传见。他遂责问：“共产党要不要老百姓？”门岗即粗暴地回答： “吓！共产党的胜利，靠你一个人吗！”并强迫他回去。
    针对这样的情况，该县结合处理重大事件，修订了机关制度，建立了人民意见箱和处理人民来信的登记、催办等制度。为了彻底转变机关作风，鄞县县委在县、区干部的扩大会上，根据浙江省委关于学习“黄逸峰事件”的指示又作了报告，号召大家坚决要把反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令、反对违法乱纪和反对压制批评的运动更深入更广泛地开展。
