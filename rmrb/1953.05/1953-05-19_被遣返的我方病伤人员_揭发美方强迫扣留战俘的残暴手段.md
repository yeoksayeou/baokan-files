Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 18th: Our correspondent reports: Repatriated wounded and sick personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army said that the U.S. side never informed them of the statement issued on April 6th last year by the spokesmen of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This statement indicated that the Korean-Chinese side welcomed all captured personnel back to the embrace of the motherland to reunite with their families and resume peaceful lives; this would not be altered in any way because some individuals had been forced to tattoo themselves, or write certain documents, or perform other similar acts under U.S. detention. U.S. representatives had repeatedly claimed at the armistice negotiation meetings that the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camp authorities had conveyed this statement to the prisoners of war. For example, on April 19th of last year, when the U.S. side first presented their so-called "screening" results, they said: "As part of the screening process, every prisoner of war was informed of your April 6th political amnesty statement."

In the temporary hospital in Kaesong, the reporter read this statement to many returning wounded and sick soldiers, who said that not only had they not heard the content of this statement, but they were completely unaware that such a statement existed. On the contrary, the wounded and sick soldiers recounted the various rumors and intimidations made by the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camp authorities during the forced screening in order to prevent prisoners of war from daring to return home, such as saying: "You have already surrendered to the Allied Forces, and the Communist Party's battlefield discipline is unforgiving." To the prisoners of war who had been forced to tattoo themselves, they would say: "You have already been tattooed, and if you return to the mainland, you will only face death."

Several returning wounded and sick soldiers from the People's Army said that a prisoner-of-war camp in Busan conducted a "screening" on May 20th of last year. At that time, American tanks and machine guns were placed all around, and the prisoners of war were ordered to line up, raise their hands, and hold their heads. The "screening" officer announced: "Those who want freedom, go south! Those who want to be enslaved forever, go north!" However, only three elderly people went south, and the rest all went to the side that insisted on repatriation. The U.S. military immediately opened fire, killing and wounding many prisoners of war.

The returning wounded and sick soldiers confirmed and provided a large amount of evidence to show that in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents adopted all kinds of appalling means to threaten prisoners of war and prevent them from daring to return home, demonstrating that all screenings were carried out under violence. If one were to ask: Why is Harrison afraid to hand over prisoners of war to neutral nations? Why is he afraid that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can effectively perform its duty of preventing forced detention? Why is he afraid that prisoners of war will receive a full explanation of their repatriation rights? Then these facts provide a clear answer.

### 被遣返的我方病伤人员  揭发美方强迫扣留战俘的残暴手段

    被遣返的我方病伤人员
    揭发美方强迫扣留战俘的残暴手段
    【新华社开城十八日电】本社记者报道：被遣返的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军病伤人员说，美方从未让他们知道去年四月六日朝鲜人民军最高司令部和中国人民志愿军司令部发言人发表的声明，这一声明表示：朝中方面欢迎全体被俘人员回到祖国怀抱，与其家人团聚，重过和平生活；这绝不因一部分人在美方拘留下曾被迫刺字、或写下某种文件、或作其它类似的行为而有所改变。美方代表曾多次在停战谈判会议上声称：美军战俘营当局已把这一声明传达给战俘。譬如去年四月十九日美方第一次提出他们所谓“甄别”结果时，就曾经说：“作为甄别程序的一部分，每一个战俘被告知了你们四月六日政治赦免性的声明。”
    在开城的临时病院里，记者曾把这个声明念给许多归来的病伤员听，他们说不但没有听到过这个声明的内容，而且根本不知道有过这样的声明。相反地，病伤员们讲述了美军战俘营当局在进行强迫甄别时为了使战俘不敢回家所作的种种造谣恐吓，比如说：“你们已经向联军投降了，共产党的战场纪律是不容情的。”对于被迫刺过字的战俘就说：“你们已经刺了字，如回大陆去只有死路一条。”
    归来的几个人民军病伤员说：釜山的一个战俘营，去年五月二十日进行了“甄别”。当时四面摆满美军坦克与机关枪，战俘们被命令排好队，将两手举起，抱住自己的头。“甄别”官宣布说：“要自由的，向南走！要永远被奴役的，向北走！”但是只有三个老年人向南去，其余的全都走到坚持遣返的一边。美军当即开枪射击，打死打伤战俘多人。
    归来的病伤员们证实并提供了大量证据，说明在美方战俘营中，李承晚和蒋介石特务为了威胁战俘，使他们不敢回家而采取的种种骇人听闻的手段，说明一切甄别都是在暴力下进行的。如果要问：为什么哈利逊害怕把战俘交给中立国？害怕中立国遣返委员会能有效地执行其防止强迫扣留的职责？害怕战俘得到关于他们遣返权利的充分解释？那么，这些事实便提供了清楚的答复。
