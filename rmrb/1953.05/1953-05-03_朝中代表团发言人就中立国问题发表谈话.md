Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 2nd: The US side has repeatedly refused to seriously discuss the issue of sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to neutral countries, and insists on our side specifically nominating a neutral country and expresses opposition to our side's intention to nominate an Asian neutral country. A reporter specifically visited the spokesman of the Korean-Chinese Armistice Negotiation Delegation regarding the above situation. The spokesman replied as follows:

Regarding a neutral country to which the remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated will be sent, the United Nations Command previously proposed Switzerland, and now proposes Sweden. We must reiterate that our position is not to oppose Switzerland or Sweden as neutral countries, but we cannot agree to designating Switzerland or Sweden as the neutral country to which prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated will be sent. Because it is inconceivable not to send these prisoners of war to a neighboring neutral country, but to send them to faraway Europe. Secondly, Switzerland and Sweden are both neutral countries of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 37 of the draft armistice agreement. According to the same clause of the draft armistice agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has a total of four countries. If a neutral country from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is nominated as the neutral country to which prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated will be sent, then the four countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Sweden should be nominated, and these prisoners of war should be sent to these four countries. Can the United Nations Command agree to this?

Starting from a pragmatic attitude, our side believes that it is most appropriate for an Asian country to serve as the neutral country to which prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated are sent. The United Nations Command clearly denied on the April 30th meeting that Asia can have neutral countries. This cannot help but make us feel extremely surprised. Does the United Nations Command really think that India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Burma, etc. in Asia are not neutral countries?

The United Nations Command requests that we nominate a specific neutral country now. However, our side believes that it is only after the method of sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country is determined first, that it will be easy to specifically contact the neutral country. The United Nations Command has not yet agreed to the method of sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country. Obviously, under the premise that the United Nations Command has not yet agreed to the above method, if our side were to contact and nominate an Asian country, then regardless of whether the United Nations Command approves of this Asian country or not, the result will be in vain, and it will also put this neutral country in a very difficult position. We are unwilling to do this. We believe that our side's step of proceeding with a specific neutral country nomination after the method of sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country is determined first is in full consultation spirit and is necessary to respect the neutral country.

We believe that the United Nations Command should reconsider and agree to the method of sending prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to a neutral country. This method is the most central step in the proposals of the Chinese and Korean governments on March 30th and March 31st, General Nam Il's explanation on April 9th, and our side's six-point specific implementation plan on April 26th. It is where our side's most obvious concession lies. The vast majority of world opinion has expressed sympathy and support for it. The United Nations Command must carefully consider it.

    朝中代表团发言人就中立国问题发表谈话
    【新华社开城二日电】　连日美方不肯对将未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去的问题进行郑重讨论，而坚持要我方具体提名一个中立国家并对我方准备提一个亚洲中立国家的意见表示反对。记者特就上述情况走访朝中停战谈判代表团发言人，承发言人答复如下：
    关于将未被直接遣返的其余战俘送到其领土上去的一个中立国，联合国军方面过去提出瑞士，现在又提出瑞典。我们必须再次说明，我方的立场并不是反对瑞士或瑞典是中立国，但我方不能同意将瑞士或瑞典定为将未被直接遣返的战俘送到其领土上去的一个中立国。因为不将这些战俘送到邻近的一个中立国家，而将他们送到辽远的欧洲去，这是不可能设想的。其次，瑞士和瑞典都是停战协定草案第二条第三十七款所规定的中立国监察委员会的中立国家。根据停战协定草案同一条款，中立国监察委员会共有四个国家。如果从中立国监察委员会国家中提名将未被直接遣返的战俘送到其领土上去的中立国家，那么，就应该提波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士、瑞典四个国家，而将这些战俘分送到这四个国家去。这样，联合国军方面能同意吗？
    我方从实事求是的态度出发，认为把未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去的那个中立国，以由一个亚洲国家来担任最为适宜。联合国军方面在四月三十日会议上显明否定亚洲可以有中立国家。这使我们不能不感到极端诧异。难道联合国军方面竟认为在亚洲的印度、巴基斯坦、印尼、缅甸等都不是中立国吗？
    联合国军方面要求我们现在就提名一个具体的中立国家。但是，我方认为只有把将未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去的办法先行确定之后，才便于和中立国具体接洽，而联合国军方面至今尚不肯同意将未被直接遣返的战俘送交中立国去的办法。显然，在联合国军方面对上述办法尚不肯同意的前提之下，如果我方就去向一个亚洲国家接洽并进行提名，那么，无论联合国军方面赞成这个亚洲国家与否，其结果都将落空，而且还要使这个中立国家处于非常为难的地位。这我们是不愿作的。我们认为我方要在将未被直接遣返的战俘送交中立国去的办法先行确定之后，再进行具体中立国提名的步骤是具有充分协商精神的，并且是为了尊重中立国所必须采取的。
    我们认为联合国军方面应该再次考虑并同意将未被直接遣返的战俘送到中立国去的办法。这个办法是中朝两国政府三月三十日、三月三十一日的建议，朝中谈判代表团首席代表南日大将四月九日的说明以及我方四月二十六日的六点具体实施方案中最中心的步骤。它是我方最明显的让步之所在。世界极大部分舆论已经对它表示了同情和支持。联合国军方面必须加以慎重考虑。
