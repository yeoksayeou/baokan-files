    The international working class's close unity in victorious struggle, the May Day Labor Day festival, has arrived. Millions of working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are celebrating this great festival with their brilliant labor achievements and their boundless confidence in the future of the working class cause. On this festival, they will proudly review and inspect the tremendous victories they have achieved in their labor. In the years since World War II, the broad masses of working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, through glorious labor, have greatly increased the economic strength of their motherlands, fundamentally changed the face of their motherlands, and created a happy life for themselves.

    The advanced socialist and people's democratic systems have completely and reliably guaranteed the most basic rights of every working person – the right to work and political rights. In contrast to the capitalist countries, where the unemployed are reduced to the streets and workers live in misery, the work and lives of working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are guaranteed by the constitution. Due to the continuous development of the national economies of these countries and the increasing demand for labor, the phenomenon of unemployment has been completely eliminated in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The number of people employed in various sectors of the national economy has increased rapidly, and the ranks of the working class have grown tremendously. For example, in the Soviet Union in 1952, the number of employees increased by 10.2 million compared to 1940. In Poland, the number of workers and staff employed in the socialist economic sector was 3.9 million in 1949, and by the end of 1952 it had increased to 5.6 million. In Hungary, the number of workers will increase by 650,000 during the Five-Year Plan. The number of people employed in other People's Democracies is also increasing year by year.

    With the development of production and the increase of social material wealth, the income of working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies has increased significantly. Last year, the average real income of each worker in the Soviet Union increased to more than 1.6 times that of the pre-war year of 1940. In 1952, the real wages of Hungarian workers had increased several times compared to the pre-war period. The increase in the purchasing power of the working people, the development of light industry, and the repeated reductions in prices have greatly increased the sales of consumer goods in various countries. For example, Soviet state-owned stores sold more than twice as much meat in 1952 as in 1948. In Albania, the amount of clothing and shoes supplied to the people is now twice that of the pre-war period, and food is six times that of the pre-war period. The sales of many valuable items have also increased significantly. For example, Czechoslovakia will increase the supply of refrigerators to residents by 84 percent this year, and almost one-tenth of the population of Hungary now owns radios.

    The party and government of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are taking all necessary and possible measures to continuously meet the material and cultural needs of the working people and improve their lives. Governments of various countries allocate large amounts of funds each year for social welfare and cultural and educational undertakings. The expenses in this regard often account for a large proportion of the national income or budget expenditure of various countries and are increasing every year. In 1952, the Soviet government allocated more than three times as much money for the cultural welfare of the working people as it did before the war. In Czechoslovakia, 70 percent of the national income in 1952 was used to meet the material and cultural needs of the people.

    One of the significant symbols of the happy life of the working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is the social insurance system that is widely practiced in these countries. Under this system, millions of working people are not only completely exempt from the threat of life due to illness, injury, disability, old age, and infirmity, but also have the opportunity to receive free recuperation and treatment. The vast majority of employees in the Soviet Union can receive subsidies from the social insurance fund equivalent to 80 to 100 percent of their actual wages when they are sick. More than 90 percent of workers in Czechoslovakia are now able to enjoy the benefits of social insurance.

    In the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, many places with beautiful mountains and clear waters - places that were once occupied by landlords and capitalists for their own enjoyment - have now become sanatoriums for working people. In 1952, 300,000 employees in Romania were provided with expenses by the trade union to recuperate and vacation in the mountains and seaside. In Hungary, one-twentieth of the national population gets the opportunity to enjoy free recuperation and preferential treatment every year.

    In capitalist society, the differences in people's living conditions strongly demonstrate the disparity between the rich and the poor and the contradictions of class society. This situation no longer exists in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. In the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, new houses are being built everywhere like mushrooms after a rain, and tens of thousands of workers, staff members and their families are moving into new homes together. In the six or seven years after the war, the Soviet Union built houses with a living area of more than 150 million square meters for the working people. The amount of money allocated by Romania for the construction of workers' dormitories has increased several times - 10 billion lei (Romanian currency) in 1948, and 62 billion lei in 1950.

    The happiness of the lives of the working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is also significantly reflected in the improvement of their cultural and technical level, and in their satisfaction of the needs for culture and art. After the working people became the masters of their own country, they have the full possibility to master culture, science, and enjoy all the achievements of modern technology and civilization. The party and government of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, while vigorously leading economic construction, also pay great attention to cultural construction. Therefore, the cultural and educational undertakings of these countries have developed greatly. The number of Soviet workers who learned new technologies or improved their technical level through spare-time study last year increased by more than one million compared with 1946. The development of elementary education, secondary and higher education, and specialized technical education in various People's Democracies is amazing. The number of people studying in schools at all levels in Romania currently exceeds one-tenth of the national population. In Hungary, in the 1951-1952 school year, there were a total of 1.25 million primary school students, 120,000 secondary school students, and nearly 50,000 university students. The children of workers and peasants account for more than 70 percent of the total number of students. The improvement of the cultural level of workers and peasants has promoted the development of the publishing industry. Poland has published more books in the more than seven years since the establishment of the people's regime than in the twenty years of capitalist rule. Many countries can get an average of three, four, six or seven books per person per year.

    Artistic activities have also become an indispensable part of the lives of working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. There are hundreds of thousands of amateur theaters and music groups composed of workers in the Soviet Union, with about 2 million members. The number of urban cinemas in Poland has increased from more than 400 in 1945 to nearly 700, and the number of rural cinemas has reached 1,000.

    The broad participation of the people in social and political activities and participation in the management of the country is one of the important manifestations of the full political rights enjoyed by the working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The political power of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies serves the people and belongs to the people. The Soviet Union held local Soviet elections in February and March this year, and elected more than 1.5 million representatives in more than 82,000 administrative units across the country. Many people who have outstanding achievements in labor and work and can represent the opinions of the masses have been elected as representatives of local Soviets to participate in the management of state power organs. Now, in the Hungarian National Assembly, 181 of the 402 members are workers, 124 are working peasants, and 97 are intellectuals. Like the Soviet Union, the people of the People's Democracies have the full right to express their opinions on the activities of the government and major political events of the country. For example, the draft of the new Polish constitution, which has now been passed, has been discussed by the broad masses of the Polish people. During the discussion process, more than 200,000 large and small meetings were held, with more than 11 million people participating.

    The free and happy lives of the working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies fully demonstrate the superiority of socialism and the people's democratic system. Comrade Stalin said 17 years ago, "The characteristic of our revolution is that it not only gave the people freedom, but also gave the people material happiness, and gave the people the possibility of a civilized and prosperous life." The millions of working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have deeply realized from their personal experiences that only socialism and the people's democratic system can eliminate the terrible phenomena of unemployment, poverty, and backwardness that are inevitable in capitalist society, and can bring them true happiness. From their personal experiences, they not only see their bright future of communism and socialism, but also deeply believe that the glorious prospect of the complete liberation of the working people of the world will eventually be realized.

    苏联和欧洲人民民主国家劳动人民的幸福生活
  　陈有为
    国际工人阶级亲密团结进行胜利战斗的节日——五一劳动节来到了。苏联和人民民主国家的千百万劳动人民，以他们辉煌的劳动成就和对工人阶级事业前途的无限信心，来庆祝这个伟大节日。在这节日里，他们将自豪地回顾和检阅自己在劳动中所取得的巨大胜利。在第二次世界大战以后的年代里，苏联和人民民主国家的广大劳动人民，用光荣的劳动，大大地增加了自己祖国的经济力量，根本地改变了自己祖国的面貌，并为自己创造了幸福的生活。
    先进的社会主义与人民民主制度，使得每一个劳动人民的最基本的权利——工作权利与政治权利获得了完全可靠的保障。和资本主义各国失业者沦落街头，工人生活十分悲惨的情景相反，苏联和人民民主国家劳动人民的工作与生活是被宪法所保证的。由于各国国民经济不断发展，劳动力的需求日益增加，现在苏联和人民民主国家已经完全消灭了失业的现象，国民经济各部门的就业人数有了迅速的增加，工人阶级的队伍有了极大的发展。如苏联一九五二年的职工人数比一九四○年增加了一千零二十万人，波兰在社会主义经济部门工作的工人、职员数目，在一九四九年为三百九十万人，而在一九五二年年底已增加到五百六十万人。匈牙利在五年计划期间，工人数目将增加六十五万人。其他各人民民主国家的就业人数也是逐年激增。
    随着生产的发展和社会物质财富的增多，苏联和人民民主国家劳动人民的收入是显著地增加了。去年苏联每一工人的平均实际收入，已增加到战前一九四○年的一点六倍多。一九五二年匈牙利工人的实际工资已比战前提高了好几倍。劳动人民购买力的提高，轻工业的发展和物价的一再减低，使得各国消费品的销售量大增，如苏联国营商店在一九五二年内售出的肉类比一九四八年增加了一倍多，阿尔巴尼亚供应全国人民的衣着鞋袜数量现在已等于战前的两倍，食品为战前的六倍；许多贵重用品的销售量也有很大的增加，如捷克斯洛伐克今年供应给居民的冰箱要增加百分之八十四，匈牙利现在全国几乎已有十分之一的人口有了收音机。
    苏联与人民民主国家的党和政府采取一切必要的和可能的措施来不断地满足劳动人民的物质与文化需求，改善他们的生活。各国政府每年都要拨付大量的款项用于社会福利与文教事业，这方面的费用常常占着各国国民收入或预算支出的很大部分，并且每年都有增加。苏联政府为了劳动人民的文化福利事业而拨付的款项，在一九五二年比战前增加了三倍多，捷克斯洛伐克一九五二年国民收入的百分之七十是用来满足人民的物质与文化需要的。
    苏联与人民民主国家劳动人民幸福生活的显著标志之一，是这些国家所广泛实行的社会保险制度。在这个制度之下，千百万劳动人民不仅可以完全免除因疾病、受伤、残废、年迈力衰而不能工作的生活威胁，而且还可以得到免费休养与疗养的机会。苏联绝大多数职工在生病时可以从社会保险基金中领到相当于他们实际工资百分之八十到一百的补助金。捷克斯洛伐克全国工人现在已有百分之九十以上能够享受社会保险的利益。
    在苏联和人民民主国家内，今天许多山明水秀、风光绮丽的地方——那些过去曾被地主与资本家霸占来纵情享乐的场所，已经成为劳动人民的疗养中心了。罗马尼亚在一九五二年由工会供给费用到山间、海滨去休养度假的职工就有三十万人，匈牙利每年获得免费休养与优待疗养的机会的占全国人口二十分之一。
    在资本主义社会中，人们居住状况的差别，强烈地表现出了贫富之间的悬殊与阶级社会的矛盾。这种情况，在苏联和人民民主国家内是早已不存在了。在苏联和人民民主国家里，新的住宅像雨后春笋一样地到处修建起来，成千成万的工人职员和他们的家属一起搬进了新居。在战后的六、七年间，苏联为劳动人民建筑了居住面积达一亿五千多万平方公尺的房屋。罗马尼亚为兴建工人宿舍而拨付的款项增加了好几倍——一九四八年是一百亿列伊（罗币），而一九五○年是六百二十亿列伊。
    苏联和人民民主国家劳动人民生活的幸福，也显著地表现在他们的文化和技术水平的提高，表现在他们对于文化艺术需求的满足上。劳动人民在做了自己国家的主人以后，就完全有可能来掌握文化、科学，并享用现代技术与文明的一切成就。苏联和人民民主国家的党和政府，在大力领导经济建设的同时，也十分注意文化方面的建设。因此，这些国家的文教事业有了巨大的发展。苏联工人因业余进修而学会新技术或提高本身技术水平的人数，去年比一九四六年增加了一百多万人。初等教育、中等与高等教育以及专门性的技术教育，在各人民民主国家内的发展是惊人的。罗马尼亚目前在各级学校中学习的人数，超过了全国人口的十分之一，匈牙利在一九五一——一九五二年的学年中，共有一百二十五万小学生，十二万中学生与近五万大学生。工农的子弟约占学生总数的百分之七十以上。工农文化水平的提高，促进了出版事业的发展，波兰在人民政权建立七年多来所出版的书籍，比资本主义统治时代的二十年还多，许多国家每人每年平均可以得到三、四本到六、七本书。
    艺术活动也已成为苏联和人民民主国家劳动人民生活中的不可缺少的一部分了。苏联由工人组成的业余剧团与音乐团体就有十来万个，拥有团员约二百万人。波兰的城市电影院已由一九四五年的四百多个增到近七百个，乡村电影院则达到一千个。
    人民广泛参加社会、政治活动，参加国家的管理工作，是苏联和人民民主国家劳动人民享有充分政治权利的重要表现之一。苏联和人民民主国家的政权是为人民服务并属于人民所有的。苏联在今年二、三月间举行了地方苏维埃选举，在全国八万二千多个行政单位中选出了一百五十多万名代表。许多在劳动中与工作中具有优秀成绩的、能够代表群众意见的人们，都被选为地方苏维埃的代表，参加国家政权机关的管理工作。现在匈牙利的国民议会中，四百零二名议员里有一百八十一人是工人出身，一百二十四人是劳动农民出身，九十七人是知识分子出身，和苏联一样，人民民主国家人民对于政府的活动与国家的重大政治事件，完全有权提出自己的意见，如现已通过的波兰的新宪法草案，曾被波兰全国广大人民讨论过。在讨论过程中所举行的大小集会达二十万次以上，参加的人数超过一千一百万人。
    苏联和人民民主国家劳动人民的自由幸福的生活，充分地说明了社会主义与人民民主制度的优越性。斯大林同志在十七年前说过的一句话，就说明了这一点。他说：“我们的革命的特点是：它不仅给了人民以自由，而且给了人民以物质的幸福，给了人民以文明富足的生活的可能性。”苏联和人民民主国家的千百万劳动人民，从他们的亲身的经历中，深深地体会到，只有社会主义与人民民主制度才能消灭资本主义社会所不可避免的失业、贫困与落后的可怕现象，才能给他们带来真正的幸福；从他们的亲身经历中，他们不仅看见了自己的共产主义与社会主义的灿烂前途，并且也深信全世界劳动人民获得彻底解放的光辉远景最后必将实现。
