Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 25th: According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker" on May 19th, the newly formed New York Peace Committee is calling on all citizens of New York to write to Eisenhower and visit their members of Congress to demand a ceasefire in Korea and a conference of great powers.

After electing an executive committee, the committee passed a five-point program demanding: 1. Peace in Korea, an immediate ceasefire, and swift completion of the armistice negotiations. 2. Resolve international tensions through consultation, establish peaceful and friendly relations between socialist and capitalist countries, and develop free trade between East and West. 3. Adopt a policy of non-interference in colonial independence movements. Recognize the right of the people of all countries to determine their own form of government. 4. Develop a worldwide disarmament plan and ban all weapons of mass destruction. 5. End the burden of war expenses on the American people, reduce taxes, and develop plans for full employment, social services, and peaceful public works.

The committee's executive committee has written to President Eisenhower expressing the deep concern of people from all walks of life in New York about the continuation of the Korean War and the slow progress in resolving the armistice issue, and urging Eisenhower to accept the proposal to convene a conference of great powers.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 25th: The New York "Daily Worker" of May 19th reprinted a letter recently published in the "Detroit News" under the title "Does America Want a Korean Armistice?". The letter, signed by Charles My Dewey, condemns the U.S. State Department and newspapers, saying: "Although the United States itself has repeatedly stated that the POW issue is the final obstacle to a Korean armistice, the State Department and newspapers do not accept the POW solution, but instead constantly promote fabricated stories of 'atrocities' and absurd predictions about 'Communist conspiracies' in an attempt to incite public opinion."

The letter said that the American people naturally expect an immediate ceasefire, but the situation is discouraging, and the U.S. government appears panicky and evasive about the proposals of the Korean and Chinese sides. The letter said: "While our government is being evasive, radio broadcasts and newspapers are waging psychological warfare on the American people. These agencies are spreading an atmosphere of 'atrocity' stories everywhere; they undoubtedly hope in this way to create a mood of revenge rather than a demand for peace among the American people.

These editors must think the American people are all neurotic and will indiscriminately believe these crude fabricated stories. But even if newspapers distort the facts, it does not change the testimony of wounded American prisoners of war, who almost without exception say that they were treated well.

Speaking of atrocities, why do American newspapers not mention the fact that hundreds of Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war were shot in our POW camps? They were shot because they exercised their rights as prisoners of war to resist illegal forced screening."

    纽约和平委员会通过五点纲领
    要求迅速完成谈判实现朝鲜和平
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】据纽约“工人日报”五月十九日报道，新成立的纽约和平委员会号召纽约全体市民写信给艾森豪威尔并访问他们的国会议员，要求实现朝鲜停战和举行大国会议。
    该委员会在选出执行委员会后通过了五点纲领，要求：一、实现朝鲜和平，立即停战，并迅速完成停战谈判。二、通过协商办法解决国际间的紧张局势，建立社会主义国家与资本主义国家间的和平友好关系，发展东西方之间的自由贸易。三、对殖民地独立运动采取不干涉政策。承认一切国家的人民享有决定他们自己的政府形式的权利。四、制定世界范围的裁减军备计划，禁止一切大规模破坏的武器。五、结束战争费用加在美国人民身上的负担，减低赋税，制定全部就业、社会服务与和平的公共工程的计划。
    该委员会的执行委员会已致函艾森豪威尔总统，表示纽约各界市民对朝鲜战争的继续以及解决停战问题的迟缓深感忧虑，并且要求艾森豪威尔接受召开大国会议的建议。
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】五月十九日的纽约“工人日报”转载了“底特律新闻”最近在“试问美国要不要朝鲜停战”标题下发表的一封信。这封信的署名者是查尔斯·迈·杜威，他谴责美国国务院和报纸说：“虽然美国自己已一再地声明战俘问题是朝鲜停战的最后障碍，可是国务院和报纸却不接受战俘问题的方案，反而一天到晚不停地宣传虚构的‘暴行’故事和关于‘共产党诡计’的荒谬预言，企图煽动舆论。”
    这封信说，美国人民自然期望立即停战，然而，情形却很令人丧气，美国政府对朝中方面的建议表现惊惶失措、支吾其词。这封信说：“在我们政府支吾其词的同时，无线电广播和报纸对美国人民进行心理战。这些机关到处散布‘暴行’故事的空气，它们无疑地希望这样在美国人民中制造一种复仇的情绪而不是要求和平的情绪。
    这些编辑们必定以为美国人民都是有神经病的，他们都会不分皂白地相信这些粗浅的虚构的故事的。但是即使报纸歪曲事实，也改变不了受伤的美国战俘的作证，他们几乎毫无例外地说，他们受到了良好的待遇。
    谈到暴行的问题，为什么美国报纸一字不提在我们的战俘营中枪杀成百名中国和北朝鲜战俘的事实呢？他们之所以被枪杀，是因为他们运用他们作为战俘所享有的权利来反抗非法的强迫甄别。”
