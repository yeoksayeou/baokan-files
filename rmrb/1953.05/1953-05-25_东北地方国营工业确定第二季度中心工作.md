Northeast Local State-Owned Industry Determines Key Tasks for the Second Quarter

The Northeast Administrative Committee's Local Industry Bureau convened a meeting of directors (bureaus) of industry from various provinces and cities in early April to study how to further implement the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's instruction that "the policy of local state-owned industry should be to concentrate efforts on consolidation and improvement" and to determine the focus of work for the second quarter.

The meeting focused on criticizing the serious phenomenon of blind development in local state-owned industry, and pointed out that this was mainly due to the "grasping for greatness and craving success" mentality of many enterprise leaders, who did not proceed from actual needs. They were single-mindedly trying to turn the factories they led into "first-class large factories" to show off their achievements, and therefore could not focus their main energy on how to improve business management and unleash the potential of the enterprise. Instead, regardless of technical conditions, high costs, or the needs of the people, they blindly expanded factory buildings, increased personnel, and set up large projects. For example, the local state-owned match factory in Heilongjiang Province blindly expanded its workforce, and is now forced to shut down due to its products not finding a market. Another example is the Liaodong Provincial Machinery Factory, which has more than doubled its workforce in the past year, but still only has one technical staff member. Even under these technical conditions, the factory blindly set a huge production plan for manufacturing large machines, resulting in the complete failure of the plan. The meeting also criticized the chaotic phenomena in the business management of local state-owned industry. Generally, local state-owned industries lack unified product quality standards and production responsibility systems, and quality inspections are perfunctory. Many factory and mine leaders lack the concept of economic accounting, and simply pursue profits, mass-producing products in a shoddy manner when they see that a certain product is selling well. Some units even falsify costs to deceive higher authorities in order to gain more profit, resulting in the shortcomings of low product quality and high costs in local state-owned industry not being overcome for a long time. The waste caused by low product quality and blind production is alarming.

The meeting determined the central tasks of local state-owned industry in the second quarter: 1. Continue to implement the policy of "consolidation and improvement," and oppose the practice of grasping for greatness, seeking excessive quantity, and blind development; at the same time, criticize and correct the erroneous idea that "local state-owned industry has no future." Local state-owned industry should advance steadily under the unified planning of the central government and undertake the arduous tasks in national economic construction, namely: producing building materials and construction machinery needed for capital construction; manufacturing a large number of new-style horse-drawn farm implements for supply to rural areas; fully meeting the needs of people's livelihoods; and ensuring the completion of military processing tasks. 2. Focus on improving product quality and strive to comprehensively fulfill the state plan. Enterprises can formulate work steps to improve product quality based on the specific conditions of their units, mobilize all employees to discuss and revise quality standards and technical operating procedures, establish and improve quality inspection systems, and formulate wage and reward systems conducive to improving quality. Provincial and municipal industrial departments (bureaus) can establish quality appraisal committees to grasp product quality standards. New products must be appraised and qualified before production can begin. In the second quarter, all units must also prepare for reducing costs and strengthening quota management, such as studying how to improve labor quotas, reduce raw material consumption quotas, and summarize the experience of advanced factories and mines in determining quotas. 3. In order to improve business management and improve product quality, in the second quarter, we will begin to study the problems existing in four different types of industries: agricultural implements, red bricks, paper, and oil, and propose different requirements for improvement work. 4. In conjunction with doing a good job in product quality, rectify labor organization and improve management systems.

    东北地方国营工业确定第二季度中心工作
    东北行政委员会地方工业局于四月初召开了各省市工业厅（局）长会议，研究如何进一步贯彻中共中央东北局关于“地方国营工业的方针应是集中力量进行巩固与提高的工作”的指示，确定第二季度工作中心。
    会议着重批判了地方国营工业盲目发展的严重现象，并指出这主要是由于许多企业领导干部有一种“好大喜功”的、不从实际需要出发的思想。他们一心要把自己所领导的工厂办成个“一等大厂”，以显示自己的成绩，因而就不能把主要精力用在如何改善经营管理，发挥企业潜在力上，而是不顾技术条件、成本高低、人民需要，盲目地扩大厂房，增添人员，摆大摊子。例如黑龙江省地方国营火柴厂盲目地扩充职工人数，现在因产品找不到销路而被迫停工。又如辽东省机械厂在近一年内职工人数也增加了一倍多，但是其中技术人员始终还只有一个。该厂甚至在这种技术条件下，盲目地订了个制造大型机器的庞大的生产计划，结果计划全部落空。会议对地方国营工业在经营管理方面的混乱现象，也进行了批判。地方国营工业一般地都没有统一的产品质量标准和生产责任制，质量检查流于形式。许多厂矿的领导干部缺乏经济核算思想，单纯追求利润，看到某种产品的销路好，便粗制滥造地大量生产。也有些单位为多得利润，竟假造成本欺骗上级，致使地方国营工业的产品质量低、成本高的缺点长久得不到克服。由于产品质量低和盲目生产而造成的浪费是很惊人的。
    会议确定了地方国营工业在第二季度的中心工作：一、继续贯彻“巩固与提高”的方针，反对贪大贪多、盲目发展的做法；同时要批判和纠正认为“地方国营工业没有前途”的错误思想。要使地方国营工业在中央统一计划下稳步前进，很好地担当起在国家经济建设中的艰巨任务，即生产基本建设所需要的建筑材料和建筑机械；大量制造新式马拉农具供应农村；充分满足人民生活资料的需要；保证军需加工任务的完成。二、以提高产品质量为中心，争取全面完成国家计划。各企业可根据本单位的具体情况，拟出改进产品质量的工作步骤，发动全体职工讨论和修订质量标准及技术操作规程，建立和健全质量检查制度，制订有利于提高质量的工资制度和奖励制度。各省市工业厅（局）可成立质量鉴定委员会，以便掌握产品质量标准。新产品必须经过鉴定合格后再进行生产。各单位在第二季度中还要进行降低成本和加强定额管理的准备工作。如研究提高劳动定额，降低原材料消耗定额，总结先进厂矿查定定额的经验等。三、为改进经营管理和提高产品质量，第二季度开始着手研究农具、红砖、纸、油四个不同类型行业中存在的问题，提出不同的改进工作的要求。四、结合搞好产品质量工作，整顿劳动组织，健全管理制度。
