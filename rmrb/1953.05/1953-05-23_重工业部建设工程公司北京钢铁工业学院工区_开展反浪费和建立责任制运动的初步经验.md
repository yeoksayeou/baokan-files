The anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of a responsibility system campaign at the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute Construction Site of the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry was carried out in three stages. The first stage was the preparation stage. During this stage, workers were organized to study documents on anti-waste and anti-irresponsibility. At the same time, there was an in-depth understanding of the workers' thinking, and typical examples of waste and irresponsibility were used to educate all workers, making them realize the necessity, purpose, and requirements of carrying out this campaign, and dispelling ideological concerns. The second stage was the exposure and criticism stage. During this stage, through general meetings, group meetings, forums, individual talks, and worker representative meetings, all workers were mobilized to purposefully expose and criticize phenomena of waste and irresponsibility in construction, making everyone hate these phenomena and realize that the root cause of these phenomena was the failure to establish a responsibility system. The third stage was the construction stage. During this stage, all workers were organized to study and discuss various responsibility systems, and based on the problems exposed in the second stage and past experiences and lessons, a responsibility system was established realistically.

According to the experience of the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute Construction Site, to fully mobilize the masses and seriously establish a responsibility system in these three stages, the following issues must be paid attention to:

First, the leadership's thinking must be clear, and the masses' understanding must be consistent. In early April of this year, the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute Construction Site launched this campaign. At that time, the director of the construction site, the site director, and other leaders did not clearly understand the purpose of this campaign, thinking that "a leading self-criticism would be enough." Therefore, they blindly made a self-criticism to the masses and demanded that cadres at all levels "make self-criticisms at each level." This approach created confusion among the masses. Some technicians said: "Anti-waste, isn't it just targeting us!" They were afraid of being punished and dared not expose waste. Some staff members believed: "Construction waste is a matter for the construction unit, and has nothing to do with us staff." They did not actively participate in this campaign. Some group leaders and workers thought: "We criticized irresponsibility last year, and we're criticizing it again this year. After criticizing it again and again, it's still irresponsibility." They lacked confidence and were unwilling to talk about those "old phenomena" again. These ideologically chaotic phenomena reflected that leading cadres and the masses did not have a clear understanding of the purpose of this campaign. Therefore, the campaign took a detour in its early stages. After more than 20 days, the masses still had not been mobilized. The Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Construction Engineering Company discovered this situation and organized a work team to provide specific assistance to the construction site. With the help of the work team, cadres at all levels of the construction site re-studied the documents on anti-waste and anti-irresponsibility, and formulated specific plans. The director of the Basic Construction Department and the manager of the Construction Engineering Company made reports to all staff members, repeatedly pointing out that the purpose of this campaign was to educate all workers to initially establish economic accounting thinking and establish a practical and feasible responsibility system in their work; it was not to punish individuals, nor was it to "launch a vigorous campaign without establishing a system and solving problems." These reports made cadres at all levels of the construction site clearly recognize the purpose of this campaign and dispelled the ideological concerns of the masses. Technician Shen Zhihong checked the errors in the design of temporary projects and replaced the roof trusses. He said, "Without this campaign, some houses would definitely collapse and kill people." Workers from the First Construction Site said, "In the past, to get more wages quickly, we didn't care whether we violated operating procedures or not. This kind of thinking wasted a lot of the country's property!" Construction worker Song Xue'an had done a bad concrete project in the past and was not satisfied with the inspection by the technical inspectors and clashed with them. This time, he apologized for this mistake. Various construction sites exposed many phenomena of waste caused by irresponsibility. The Second Construction Site exposed more than 140 problems in four days. The vast majority of these problems were raised around the theme of "irresponsibility is the root cause of waste." This mass exposure showed that the masses at the construction site had been mobilized, and it also proved that clear leadership thinking and consistent understanding among the masses are the primary keys to doing a good job in this campaign.

Second, it is necessary to closely integrate with current work. The Beijing Iron and Steel Institute Construction Site carried out the inspection of construction preparation work under the slogan of "check current problems more, don't just dwell on old accounts." Under this slogan, they checked out many chaotic phenomena caused by irresponsibility that hindered early commencement of work. The construction site was originally scheduled to start work on April 20, but it was delayed until May 11. During the inspection, it was found that the reason for the delay was that no one was specifically responsible for budget, water and electricity, materials, equipment, and other preparatory work. Taking the preparation of the budget as an example, this work began at the end of March, but it was not clearly stipulated who would be responsible for it. A cadre in the dispatch room of the construction site said: "We are in charge of dispatch, the budget should be done by the construction site." The cadres at the construction site said: "We are only in charge of construction, the budget should be done by the dispatch room!" Passing the buck delayed the time. During the process of preparing the budget, no one was designated to lead this work, so each person did their own thing, and a unified unit of measurement was not used. Some used inches as the unit of measurement, while others used centimeters. This created difficulties in compiling these budgets and delayed the date. If these phenomena had not been corrected in time in this campaign, it is likely that the budget could not have been made to this day.

Third, it is necessary to mobilize technicians and staff members to participate in this campaign. In the early stages of the campaign, the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute Construction Site did not seriously mobilize technicians and staff members to participate in this campaign. Later, with the timely correction of the work team of the Basic Construction Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Engineering Company, technicians and staff members from the construction site, the worksite, and various sections were mobilized to participate in the inspection of waste and irresponsibility. This had a positive effect on the entire movement to establish a responsibility system. The staff of the labor and wage section checked their work and changed the slow payment of wages. The workers were very happy and said, "This time it really solves the problem! In the past, it took seven or eight days to get paid; now we get paid immediately." The technicians of the finance section exposed the phenomenon of "leading cadres approving notes at random, destroying the financial system," and quickly overcame this phenomenon and improved the financial system. The technicians of the dispatch room said: "Our dispatch room has to manage dispatch, planning, construction, construction technology, surveying, and other work, it has become a hodgepodge! We manage everything, but we can't manage anything." Therefore, the construction site changed the structure of the dispatch room, allowing the dispatch room to specifically responsible for dispatch work. In addition, a construction section was established to specifically responsible for construction. A planning and statistics section was established to specifically responsible for planning and statistics work. Currently, technicians and workers from various construction sites and sections are discussing the responsibility system, drafting plans for the responsibility system based on the actual situation, and expressing their determination to thoroughly implement the responsibility system.

Fourth, it is necessary to prepare in advance for the establishment of a responsibility system. Because the establishment of a responsibility system is a detailed and complex task that cannot be done in a few days, preparation must be made. When the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute Construction Site started this campaign, it established a special system group to study the problems found in the campaign and study which responsibility systems should be established. Because they had not established a responsibility system in the past and did not understand the content of the responsibility system, the system group first studied the Soviet experience in establishing various responsibility systems in construction, and based on the specific situation of the construction site, determined that five types of responsibility systems should be established in the construction stage, namely administrative responsibility system, construction responsibility system, technical responsibility system, supply responsibility system, and financial cost responsibility system. In order to enable all workers to understand the basic principles of these responsibility systems, the construction site also convened a special meeting, where engineers reported on the Soviet experience and explained the purpose and content of preparing operation plans, establishing a dispatch system, and establishing a small group economic accounting manual. These reports were discussed after the meeting. At the beginning of the construction stage, the construction site had already drafted the administrative responsibility system and the construction responsibility system. After the construction stage begins, these draft systems can be discussed and modified based on the actual situation. Carrying out the work of establishing a responsibility system in this prepared way can prevent the movement from being interrupted, guide the masses to move into the construction stage in a timely manner, concentrate on discussing and establishing the responsibility system, and ensure that the movement can be carried out fully.

    重工业部建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区
    开展反浪费和建立责任制运动的初步经验
    中央重工业部建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工区反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动，是分三个阶段进行的。第一阶段是酝酿阶段。在这个阶段内，组织职工学习关于反浪费、反无人负责的文件，同时深入了解职工的思想情况，并以浪费与无人负责的典型事例，来教育全体职工，使得全体职工认清开展这个运动的必要性、目的和要求，打消思想顾虑。第二阶段是揭发、批判阶段。在这个阶段内，通过全体大会、小组会、座谈会、个别谈话、职工代表会等方式，动员全体职工，有目的地揭发和批判施工中的浪费和无人负责的现象，使得大家痛恨这些现象，并且认识到这些现象所以发生的根本原因在于没有建立责任制度。第三阶段是建设阶段。在这个阶段内，组织全体职工学习和讨论各种责任制度，并根据第二阶段揭发出来的问题和过去的经验教训，实事求是地建立起责任制度。
    根据北京钢铁工业学院工区的经验，在这三个阶段内，要充分地把群众发动起来，认真建立起责任制度，必须注意下面几个问题。
    第一，领导思想必须明确，群众认识必须一致。今年四月上旬，北京钢铁工业学院工区就开展了这个运动，当时工区主任、工地主任和其他领导人员，没有明确地了解这个运动的目的，以为“带头检讨一下，就可以了”。所以他们盲目地向群众检讨了一番，并且要求各级干部“层层检讨”。这样的做法，在群众中产生了混乱的影响。有些技术人员说：
    “反浪费，还不是反我们！”他们害怕受处分，不敢揭发浪费现象。有些职员认为：“施工浪费是施工单位的事情，与我们职员无关。”他们没有积极参加这个运动。有些小组长和工人以为：“去年反过无人负责，今年又反，反来反去，还是无人负责。”他们缺乏信心，不愿意再说那些“老现象”。这些思想上混乱的现象，反映了当时领导干部和群众对于这个运动的目的是认识不清楚的。所以在运动的初期，走了弯路，经过二十多天，群众仍然没有发动起来。中央重工业部基本建设司和建设工程公司发现了这个情况，组织了工作组，对该工区进行了具体的帮助。在工作组的帮助下，工区各级干部重新学习了反浪费、反无人负责的文件，制订了具体的计划。基本建设司司长和建设工程公司经理向全体职工作了报告，反复指明这个运动的目的，是为了教育全体职工初步地树立经济核算思想，在工作上建立起切实可行的责任制度；而不是为了处分个人，也不是为了“轰轰烈烈搞运动，搞了运动，没建立制度，不解决问题”。这些报告，使工区各级干部明确地认识到这个运动的目的，打消了群众的思想顾虑。技术员沈志洪检查了设计暂设工程的错误，更换了房架子。他说：“没有这个运动，有些房子一定会倒坍，压死人。”第一工地工人说：“过去我们为了图快，可以多得工资，不管违反不违反操作规范。这种思想，给国家浪费了多少财产！”施工员宋学安在过去做坏了混凝土工程，还不满意技术检查人员的检查，和检查人员闹对立。这一次，他检讨了这个错误。各个工地揭发了许多因为无人负责而发生的浪费现象。第二工地在四天内就揭发了一百四十多条问题。这些问题，绝大部分，是围绕着“无人负责是发生浪费的根本原因”这个主题而提出来的。这样群众性的揭发，说明该工区群众已经发动起来，同时也证明领导思想的明确，群众认识一致，是搞好这个运动的首要关键。
    第二，必须紧紧结合当前工作。北京钢铁工业学院工区是在“多检查现在的问题，不要光翻老帐”的口号下进行检查施工准备工作的。在这个口号下，他们检查出许多因为无人负责而妨碍早日开工的混乱现象。该工区原定四月二十日开工，但一直拖到五月十一日才开工。在检查中，发现所以迟开工的原因，是因为预算、水电、材料、设备等准备工作没有专人负责。以做预算为例，在三月底就开始了这一工作，但没有明确规定究竟由谁来负责。该工区调度室的干部说：“我们管调度，预算应该由工地来做。”工地的干部说：“我们只管施工，预算还是由调度室来做吧！”推来推去，延误了时间。在编制预算过程中，又没有确定专人来领导这个工作，以致各人自做一套，没有采用统一的计算单位，有的以英寸为计算单位，有的却以公分为计算单位。这样在汇编这些预算时，发生困难，拖延了日期。这些现象如果不是在这次运动中及时加以纠正，很可能至今还不能做出预算来。
    第三，必须发动技术人员和职员来参加这个运动。北京钢铁工业学院工区在运动初期，没有认真发动技术人员和职员来参加这个运动，后来经重工业部基本建设司和工程公司的工作组及时的指正，才发动了工区、工地和各股的技术人员和职员参加检查浪费和无人负责现象。这对于整个建立责任制运动起了有效的作用。劳动工薪股的职员检查了自己的工作，改变了发放工资的迟缓现象。工人们很高兴，说道：“这一次真解决问题呀！过去领了七八天，还领不到工资；现在马上就领到了。”财务股的技术人员揭发了“领导干部乱批条子，破坏财务制度”的现象，并很快克服了这个现象，健全了财务制度。调度室技术人员说：“我们调度室要管调度、计划、施工、施工技术、测量等工作，成了大杂烩啦！我们样样都管，结果什么都管不了。”因此该工区改变了调度室的机构，让调度室来专门负责调度工作。另外成立了工务股，专门负责施工。成立了计划统计股，专门负责计划统计工作。目前工区各工地、各股的技术人员和职工正在讨论责任制度，根据实际情况，起草责任制度的方案，并表示决心好好地贯彻责任制度。
    第四，必须事先做好建立责任制度的准备工作。因为建立责任制度，是一件细致和复杂的工作，决不是几天内能做好的工作，所以必须做好准备工作。北京钢铁工业学院工区在开始这个运动时，就成立了专门的制度组，研究运动中所发现的问题，研究应该建立那些责任制度。由于过去没有建立过责任制度，不懂得责任制度的内容，所以制度组事先学习了苏联在施工中建立各种责任制度的经验，并根据工区的具体情况，确定了在建设阶段内建立起五种责任制度，即行政责任制、施工责任制、技术责任制、供应责任制、财务成本责任制。为了使全体职工了解这些责任制度的基本原则，工区又召集了专门会议，由工程师报告了苏联经验，说明编制作业计划、建立调度制度、建立小组经济核算手册的目的和内容。会后又讨论了这些报告。在建设阶段开始时，工区已经拟出了行政责任制和施工责任制的草稿。建设阶段开始后，就可以根据实际情况，来讨论和修改这些制度的草稿。这样有准备地进行建立责任制度的工作，就可以使运动不致中断，引导群众及时地转入建设阶段，集中精力来讨论和建立责任制度，保证运动能饱满地进行。
