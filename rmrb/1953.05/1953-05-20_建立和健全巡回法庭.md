    Establishing and Improving Circuit Courts
    Xiong Xianjue, Lin Hong

    Circuit courts are an important creation in the practice of people's judicial work. As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War, revolutionary base areas under the leadership of our Party had circuit court organizations. During the Anti-Japanese War, the "Ma Xiwu trial method" of "going deep into the countryside, investigating and researching, distinguishing right from wrong, and correctly solving problems" was well-known and supported by the masses. After the national liberation, the "Provisional Organization Regulations of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China" made legal provisions for circuit courts, which aroused the judicial organs' attention to this new organizational form. Many local people's courts, especially people's tribunals, during the great social reform movements such as land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, all "carried their files to the countryside for circuit trials," cooperating with and promoting the central tasks. In the later period of the judicial reform movement, circuit courts fully demonstrated their significant role in the process of clearing up backlog cases in various places.

    At present, our country has basically ended various social reforms and entered a period of planned economic construction. In order to adapt to this new situation and ensure the smooth progress of national economic construction from the judicial aspect, it is necessary to further strengthen the construction of judicial work. The recently held Second National Judicial Conference summarized the experience of judicial work over the past three years and determined to gradually and universally establish and improve circuit courts of grassroots people's courts. This is an important link in strengthening grassroots people's courts.

        (2)
    The superiority of circuit courts lies first in that they break the remaining yamen style of the old judicial organs, greatly facilitate the people, save the masses time and money spent on litigation, and are of great benefit to production and construction work. Because the method of circuit trial is adopted, people's courts send people deep into rural areas and industrial and mining areas to conduct trials in the places where the parties are located, using their spare time. This eliminates the need for parties to travel back and forth for litigation. After the judicial reform, the People's Court of Mengzi County, Yunnan Province, organized circuit courts to conduct trials in rural areas. Three people closed 27 cases in seven days, involving a total of 48 parties and 15 witnesses. If these 27 cases were summoned to the county for trial, apart from the travel and food expenses of the parties and witnesses, even if only an average of three workdays per person were calculated, 189 workdays would be wasted. The circuit court of Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, conducted the trial of the local tyrant Zhang Hengxi in Yongfeng Township under the moonlight, which would not delay the production of the masses. Because circuit courts have the advantage of facilitating the people, the masses praised circuit courts saying: "In the past, lawsuits were filed in the yamen, but now lawsuits are filed at the doorstep. They don't cost money, don't require travel, don't delay production, and teach principles."

    The superiority of circuit courts is also reflected in their ability to rely on the masses, conduct investigations nearby, and easily make the handling of cases correct and rapid. The two circuit courts of Bin County People's Court in Songjiang Province closed 22 cases in four days in January of this year, while in the past, only 40 cases could be closed in one month in the court. After the judicial reform, the People's Court of Tianjin County divided eight cadres into four groups to go to the countryside for nearby trials, closing 122 cases in ten days, which was also four times more efficient than trying cases in the court in the past. The reason why circuit courts handle cases quickly and correctly is that they mobilize local activists to cooperate with judicial staff in conducting investigations and research. These people have close ties with the masses, are familiar with local conditions, and some even know exactly what happened in a certain case. Therefore, they can quickly clarify the case, making it impossible for those more cunning parties or criminals to deny it. When the People's Court of Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, tried the counter-revolutionary criminal Zhao Rujiu in the county court, Zhao refused to admit the fact that he killed our revolutionary cadre Dai Qi; but when the county organized a circuit court to conduct a trial in the countryside, he could not argue when the masses confronted him, and admitted his crime. This characteristic of facilitating reliance on the masses to handle cases enables circuit courts not only to correctly and quickly handle general civil and criminal cases, but also to solve some extremely complex, entangled, and difficult-to-handle cases relatively smoothly. A century-old mountain boundary dispute in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, and a public property case involving more than 100 parties and litigated for more than 100 years in Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, were successfully resolved by circuit courts relying on the masses.

    Circuit courts in various places generally absorb the participation of the masses and hold public trials. This is a good opportunity to publicize and educate the masses on the policies and laws of the Communist Party and the People's Government through concrete and vivid facts. When the People's Court of Penglai County, Shandong Province, cleared up backlog cases not long ago, the circuit courts conducted trials nearby in various places, making the broad masses receive legal education and unanimously reflect that they "learned principles." Therefore, they automatically resolved some minor disputes. Some cases that had already been filed in the court or district and township were also automatically withdrawn.

    The superiority of circuit courts is also reflected in their ability to more closely integrate with central tasks, promptly sanction illegal acts, and effectively support the struggles of the masses. This is because circuit courts have greater flexibility. They can select typical cases based on the main issues in a certain area during a certain period, conduct trials on the spot in a timely manner, so as to educate the broad masses and promote central tasks. The People's Court of Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, organized circuit courts to go to the countryside for nearby trials in central tasks such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, great production movement, and inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law, punishing criminals who sabotaged the movement according to law, which played a great role in the smooth progress of these tasks. After the judicial reform movement, the Dalian City People's Court found that many industrial and commercial circles were in arrears with taxes, most of which were intentionally delayed. Therefore, it immediately cooperated with the Tax Bureau to hold a trial in Shahekou, and the next day it received 95% of the taxes payable.

    When circuit courts go to the countryside for nearby trials, they can also lead civil mediation work nearby and help the masses rectify or establish mediation committees. Many facts have proven that strengthening civil mediation work is also an important way to make judicial work follow the mass line. The personnel of the circuit courts who go to the countryside for trials must rely on local cadres and the masses to conduct collective mediation for general cases. This is a vivid demonstration education for the personnel of the mediation committee, which can not only make them understand how to conduct mediation, but also learn some knowledge of policies and laws. At the same time, the people's courts in various places generally assign a task to the personnel who go to the countryside for trials, that is, to let them cultivate activists through trial activities and help the masses establish the organization of the mediation committee; or to help existing mediation organizations solve some problems. Many facts have proven that strengthening the leadership of mediation work through circuit trials is very effective and feasible at present. In today's situation where county-level courts have few people and many affairs, it is impossible to draw one or two people to be in charge of mediation work full-time, and the mediation organizations are very scattered, and one or two people actually cannot manage it.

    (3)
    The circuit trials currently implemented in various places are roughly in two ways: one is to select several appropriate areas in the whole county to establish fixed "trial stations" and send people down regularly to try cases. The other is to temporarily send people down to conduct circuit trials nearby in order to clear up backlog cases or deal with a major case. According to the experience of various places, the first method is better. Because fixed "trial stations" can establish regular contact with cadres and the masses in its jurisdiction and understand the situation in a timely manner; it can also enable the mediation organization to receive regular leadership. Therefore, the people's courts at the county level should, according to the distance of the area and the number of people and cases, form several circuit courts composed of full-time cadres, and each select a central town in a fixed area to set up a "trial station." The time for hearing cases each month should be set on the date of the market, so that the court can be held for the convenience of the parties to attend the market, and more people can be absorbed to participate and expand the publicity and education of laws and disciplines. In addition to the fixed trial date, the trial personnel should conduct circuit trials in the area under their jurisdiction.

    The circuit court is an important measure to implement the mass line of judicial work from the organizational point of view. The people's courts at the county level must attach importance to this advanced experience created in judicial work and establish and improve the circuit court in a planned and step-by-step manner in the future. In order to make the circuit court truly play its role, according to the existing materials, we believe that two deviations should be opposed. First, some judicial personnel have not recognized the basic characteristics and advantages of the circuit court, and lack the mass viewpoint and the working style of the mass line. Although they also go to the countryside for circuit trials, they actually just formally move the court to the district and township government. When handling cases, they neither mobilize local cadres and the masses to cooperate in conducting investigations and research, nor absorb them to participate in the trial, or just do it formally, and in fact still do not investigate and research, detach from reality, and simply and isolatedly "sit in court and interrogate." The People's Court of Xuanwei County, Yunnan Province, still did this when it went to the countryside for on-the-spot trials after the judicial reform, which not only failed to achieve the expected results, but also aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. Second, after the judicial reform, some judicial personnel have produced a one-sided mass viewpoint. They mistakenly adopted the so-called method of "democratic sentencing," thinking that judgments must be discussed and approved by the masses before they can be considered to have followed the mass line. Sometimes, even when they know that the opinions of some masses violate policies and laws, they dare not adhere to the correct opinions, become the tail of some backward masses, and make wrong judgments. We believe that it is permissible to solicit the opinions of the masses before sentencing, but the method of "democratic sentencing" must never be adopted. Because this practice distorts the mass line, especially ignores the seriousness of the law and the due power of judicial trial work. These two deviations that occur in circuit trials are often due to the lack of leadership, supervision, and inspection by the person in charge of the local people's court over the personnel who go to the countryside for trials. Therefore, it was not prevented in advance, and it was not discovered and corrected in time afterwards.

    Regarding the establishment of circuit courts, many county-level people's courts currently hold a negative attitude. Their reason is that the number of cadres in the court is small and the quality is weak, and it is not yet possible. Only in order to clear up backlog cases, or when a case is difficult to solve, will people be sent to carry the files to the countryside for circuit trials. We believe that the fact that the number of cadres is small and the quality is weak is indeed a fact, but even in this case, it is still possible, and even necessary, to conduct typical experiments in establishing circuit courts in a planned manner. Because only through the practice of work can the level of judicial personnel be effectively improved, the phenomenon of "weak quality" be overcome, and the growth of new judicial cadres be promoted at the same time. Therefore, this statement cannot be a reason to refuse to establish a circuit court. We must understand that the circuit court is not only the organizational construction in judicial work, but also one of the important methods for the trial work to follow the mass line, and it has been consolidated institutionally in the resolution of the Second National Judicial Conference. Whoever does not understand this point, does not recognize the essence and role of the circuit court, it is difficult for him to become a good people's judicial worker.

    建立和健全巡回法庭
    熊先觉　林洪
    （一）
    巡回法庭是人民司法工作实践中的一个重要创造。远在第二次国内革命战争时期，我党领导下的革命根据地就有了巡回法庭的组织。在抗日战争时期，“深入农村，调查研究，明辨是非，正确解决问题”的马锡五审判方式，为群众熟知和拥护。全国解放以后，在“中华人民共和国人民法院暂行组织条例”中，对巡回法庭作了法律上的规定，更引起了司法机关对这一新的组织形式的重视。许多地方的人民法院，特别是人民法庭，在土地改革、镇压反革命等伟大社会改革运动中，都“携卷下乡，巡回审判”，配合和推动了中心工作。在司法改革运动后期，各地人民法院在清理积案的过程中，巡回法庭更充分地显示了它的重大作用。
    目前我们的国家已基本上结束了各种社会改革，进入了计划经济建设的时期。为了适应这一新的情况，从司法方面保障国家经济建设的顺利进行，就必须进一步加强司法工作的建设。最近召开的第二届全国司法会议，总结了三年来司法工作的经验，确定逐步地普遍地建立和健全基层人民法院的巡回法庭，这是加强基层人民法院的一个重要环节。
        （二）
    巡回法庭的优越性，首先在于它打破了残存的旧司法机关的衙门作风，大大地便利了人民，可以节省群众为诉讼而花费的时间和金钱，对于生产建设工作有很大好处。因为采用巡回审判的方法，是由人民法院派人深入农村和工矿区，就在当事人所在的地方，利用他们空闲的时间进行审判。这样就使当事人不必因诉讼而往返奔波。云南省蒙自县人民法院在司法改革后，组织巡回法庭下乡审判，三个人在七天内结案二十七件，共到当事人四十八名，证人十五名。如果这二十七个案件是传到县里审判，除了当事人和证人往返的路费和伙食费不算外，仅平均以每个人误工三个计算，就要浪费人工一百八十九个。江苏省高邮县的巡回法庭在永丰乡审判恶霸张衡溪时，是在月光下进行的，这就更不会耽误群众生产。由于巡回法庭具有便利人民的优越性，所以群众称赞巡回法庭说：“过去打官司上衙门，而今打官司在家门，一不花钱，二不跑路，三不耽误生产，四又学了道理。”
    巡回法庭的优越性，还表现在它便于依靠群众，就近进行调查，易于使案件处理得正确和迅速。松江省宾县人民法院的两个巡回法庭，在今年一月份四天结案二十二件，而过去在法院内审判一个月只能结案四十件。天津县人民法院在司法改革后，八个干部分四组下乡就近审判，十天结案一百二十二件，也比过去在法院内判案提高效率四倍。巡回法庭处理案件所以又快又正确，原因是发动了当地的积极分子，协同司法工作人员进行调查研究。这些人同群众有密切的联系，熟悉当地的情况，甚至有的人就确切知道某一案件发生的经过，因此可以把案情迅速弄明白，使那些比较狡猾的当事人或罪犯无法抵赖。江苏省高邮县人民法院在县庭审讯反革命犯赵如九时，赵犯不承认杀死我革命干部戴奇的事实；但在该县组织巡回法庭下乡审讯时，经群众和他当面对证，他无法狡辩，承认了自己的罪恶。便于依靠群众办案的这一特点，使巡回法庭不仅能够正确和迅速地处理一般民刑案件，就是一些情节极其复杂、纠缠不清、难于处理的案件，也能够比较顺利地求得解决。浙江省开化县有一件百年未解决的山界纠纷案，江苏省溧阳县有一件牵涉一百多当事人、打了一百多年官司的公产案，都由巡回法庭依靠群众顺利地解决了。
    各地的巡回法庭一般都吸收群众参加，举行公开审判。这是把共产党和人民政府的政策法令，通过具体生动的事实向群众进行宣传教育的好机会。山东省蓬莱县人民法院在不久前清理积案时，巡回法庭到各地就近审判，使广大群众受到法纪教育，一致反映“学会了道理”。因此，有些细小的纠纷案件他们就自动解决了。有些已经在法院或区乡起诉的案件也自动撤消了。
    巡回法庭的优越性还表现在能够更密切地结合中心工作，及时地制裁违法行为，有效地支持群众的斗争。这是因为巡回法庭具有较大的灵活性，它可以根据某一时期某一地区的主要问题，选择典型的案件，及时到现场进行审判，借以教育广大群众，推动中心工作。江西省广丰县人民法院在土地改革、镇压反革命、大生产运动、检查婚姻法执行情况等中心工作中，都组织巡回法庭下乡就近审判，依法惩处了破坏运动的罪犯，对这些工作的顺利进行起了很大作用。在司法改革运动后，旅大市人民法院发现工商界欠税的很多，多为故意拖欠，于是立即配合税务局在沙河口开了一次庭，第二天便收到了应缴税款的百分之九十五。
    巡回法庭在下乡就近审判时，还能就近领导民间调解工作，帮助群众整顿或建立调解委员会。许多事实已经证明：加强民间调解工作，也是使司法工作走群众路线的一项重要办法。巡回法庭下乡审判的人员，都必须依靠当地的干部和群众，对于一般案件进行集体调解。这对于调解委员会的人员是一种生动的示范教育，不仅可以使他们懂得应如何进行调解，而且可以学到一些政策法令的知识。同时各地的人民法院一般都交给下乡审判的人员一项任务，就是让他们通过审判活动培养积极分子，帮助群众建立起调解委员会的组织；或者是帮助已有的调解组织解决一些问题。许多事实已经证明，通过巡回审判加强对调解工作的领导，在目前是很有效的，也是切实可行的。在今天县级法院人少事多的情况下，要抽出一两个人专管调解工作是不可能的，而且调解组织很分散，一两个人实际上也管不过来。
    （三）
    各地现在实行的巡回审判大致有两种方式：一种是在全县选择若干适当的地区，建立固定的“审判站”，定期派人下去审理案件。一种是为了清理积案或处理某一重大案件，临时派人下去巡回就近审判。根据各地经验，以第一种方式为更好。因为固定的“审判站”，可以和它管辖区内的干部和群众建立经常的联系，及时了解情况；还可以使调解组织得到经常的领导。因此各县级人民法院，应根据地区的远近和人口、案件的多少，由专职干部组成若干巡回法庭，各在固定地区内选一中心市镇，设立“审判站”。每月审理案件的时间应定在赶集的日期，这样，可以就当事人赶集的方便开庭审判，也可以吸收更多的群众参加，扩大法纪的宣传教育。在固定的审判日期之外，审判人员应在所辖区内巡回审判。
    （四）
    巡回法庭是从组织上贯彻司法工作群众路线的重要措施。各县级人民法院必须重视司法工作中创造的这一先进经验，在今后有计划有步骤地建立和健全巡回法庭。为了使巡回法庭真正发挥作用，根据目前已有的材料，我们以为应该反对两种偏向。第
    一，是有些司法人员没有认识到巡回法庭的基本特点和优点，缺乏群众观点和群众路线的工作作风。他们虽然也下乡巡回审判，但实际上只是把法庭形式地搬到区乡政府。在处理案件时，既不发动当地干部和群众协同进行调查研究，也不吸收他们参加审判，或者只是形式主义地作一作，实际仍然是不调查研究、脱离实际，单纯地孤立地“坐堂问案”。云南省宣威县人民法院，在司法改革后下乡就地审判时还是这样作的，不仅没有收到预期的效果，反而引起了群众的不满。第二，是在司法改革后，有些司法人员产生了片面的群众观点。他们错误地采取了所谓“民主量刑”的方法，以为判决都必须经群众讨论通过，才算是走了群众路线。有时甚至明知某些群众的意见违反了政策法令，他们也不敢坚持正确的意见，做了部分落后群众的尾巴，作出了错误的判决。我们认为在量刑前征求群众的意见是容许的，但决不能采取“民主量刑”的方法。因为这种作法曲解了群众路线，特别是忽视了法律的严肃性和司法审判工作应有的权力。在巡回审判中所发生的这两种偏向，往往是因当地人民法院的负责人对下乡审判人员缺乏领导、督促和检查。因此事前未能防止，事后也未能及时发现，迅速纠正。
    对于建立巡回法庭，目前尚有不少县级人民法院抱着消极的态度。他们的理由是法院的干部量少质弱，现在还不可能。只是为了清理积案，或在某一案件难于解决时，才派人携卷下乡，巡回审判。我们以为：干部量少质弱确是事实，但是就在这种情况下，有计划地进行建立巡回法庭的典型试验，仍然是可能的，而且是必须的。因为只有通过工作的实践，才能有效地提高司法人员的水平，克服“质弱”的现象，同时也可以促进新的司法干部的成长。因此，这种说法不能成为拒绝建立巡回法庭的理由。我们必须懂得：巡回法庭不仅是司法工作中的组织建设，而且是审判工作走群众路线的重要方法之一，在第二届全国司法会议决议中，已经从制度上把它巩固起来。谁不了解这一点，不认识巡回法庭的本质和作用，谁就很难成为一个好的人民司法工作人员。
