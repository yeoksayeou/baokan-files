    The repatriated wounded and sick personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers left Andong on May 14th to recuperate in the rear of the motherland. This is a scene of people from all walks of life in Andong warmly shaking hands and saying goodbye to the wounded and sick personnel.

    The enemy used all kinds of threats and terror tactics to force our captured personnel to tattoo reactionary words on their arms in an attempt to prevent our captured personnel from returning to the motherland. Our captured personnel, who resolutely resisted the enemy's forced screening, painfully cut away the insulting words tattooed on their arms with knives. The scars on the left arm of this wounded and sick soldier are still clearly visible.

    The enemy's treatment of our wounded prisoners of war was to adopt irresponsible and inhumane measures. Limbs that could have been restored were often arbitrarily amputated, resulting in disabilities. This is a scene of our nursing staff helping a wounded and sick soldier, whose legs were amputated by the US side during treatment, to go outdoors for a walk.

    被遣返的中国人民志愿军病伤人员于五月十四日离开安东到祖国的后方去疗养。这是安东市各界人民与病伤人员亲热的握手告别的情形。

    敌人用尽一切威胁恐怖手段，强迫我方被俘人员在臂上刺上反动字眼，企图阻止我方被俘人员返回祖国。坚决反抗敌人强迫甄别的我方被俘人员，就用刀忍痛挖掉刺在臂上的污辱字句。这一位病伤员左臂上的伤痕还斑斑可见。

    敌人医治我方负伤的被俘人员是采取不负责任的非人道措施，四肢本来可以复原的，往往被任意截割，以致成为残废。这是我方护理人员扶着被美方在疗治时截去两腿的病伤员到室外散步的情形。
