Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 10th: The Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation of the Korean and Chinese side issued the following communique on May 10th:

    At the delegation meeting of both sides on May 9th, the other side raised several questions regarding our side's proposal on May 7th. Chief Representative of our side, General Nam Il, answered them at the delegation meeting of both sides on May 10th.

    General Nam Il said: "(1) We believe it is entirely reasonable to leave the disposition of prisoners of war still under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission after a certain period to be negotiated and decided by a higher-level political conference. If your side believes that within the stipulated period, all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war, after explanation by the relevant party, have all returned home based on the prisoners' applications through the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, then naturally there is no remaining prisoner of war issue under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to discuss. Originally, our side believed that handing over non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral countries for custody after the armistice, and after explanation by the relevant party, it is difficult to imagine that there would still be prisoners of war who are fearful and dare not return home, so your so-called final disposition issue would not occur at all. However, since your side raised this issue in the letter of April 16th, we believe that if there is such a problem, it can only be resolved by a higher-level political conference. It is groundless to believe that a higher-level political conference cannot reasonably resolve this issue.

    (2) Regarding the rights of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to carry out its legitimate duties and responsibilities, as stipulated in our side's May 7th proposal:

    First, it is naturally the necessary and appropriate power to control the prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction, that is, the necessary and appropriate rights that your side mentioned on May 6th to ensure complete control over the safety and administrative management of prisoners of war. Second, it is to make arrangements so that the countries to which the prisoners of war belong have the freedom and convenience to send people to the original detention locations of these prisoners of war within a four-month period from the date of taking over by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to explain to all prisoners of war affiliated with the said country.

    Third, it is responsible for assisting all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war who request to return home to quickly return to their homeland.

    (3) Regarding the rules of procedure for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its subordinate agencies, we believe that this committee and its subordinate agencies will generally not have disputes in performing the above-mentioned duties, but if disputes occur, the decision by majority agreement shall be valid.

    (4) Most of the other questions raised by your side belong to the nature of detailed arrangements. Once both sides reach an agreement on the main issues contained in our side's May 7th proposal, detailed arrangements can be resolved on a reasonable, practical, and fair basis for both sides. These detailed arrangements will also not create any unsolvable complexity because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is composed of five neutral countries. In fact, the provisions in the armistice agreement regarding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its subordinate agencies have already achieved a satisfactory solution for both sides to such problems."

    General Nam Il also pointed out: "In order to quickly resolve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation and achieve the Korean armistice, our side has adopted the premise proposed by the other side of leaving non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in Korea in the May 7th proposal. We believe that both sides should quickly reach an agreement on the main issues contained in our side's May 7th proposal so that we can immediately enter into the discussion of specific detailed arrangements."

    At the meeting on May 10th, the other side raised several inquiries regarding some specific detailed arrangements, but did not express its attitude towards our side's May 7th proposal.

    Both sides are scheduled to continue the delegation meeting at 11:00 a.m. on May 11th.

    在朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会十日会上
    南日大将答复对方的询问
    并指出双方应就主要问题迅速达成协议
    【新华社开城十日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团五月十日发表公报如下：
    五月九日的双方代表团大会上，对方曾对我方五月七日方案提出若干询问，我方首席代表南日大将在五月十日的双方代表团大会上作了答复。
    南日大将说：“（一）将经过一定期限尚在中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘的处理，交由高一级政治会议协商决定，我们认为是完全合理的。如果你方认为在规定期限内，一切未被直接遣返的战俘经过有关一方解释，均已由中立国遣返委员会根据战俘的申请，得到全部回家，那自然就没有尚在中立国遣返委员会看管下的剩余战俘问题可谈了。本来我方就认为将停战后不直接遣返的战俘交中立国接管，并经过有关一方的解释，就很难设想还有心怀疑惧不敢回家的战俘，因此就根本不会发生你方的所谓最后处理的问题。但由于你方在四月十六日来信中提出了这一问题，我们认为如果有这样的问题，那很显然只有高一级的政治会议才能处理。认为高一级的政治会议不能合理解决这个问题，是没有根据的。
    （二）关于中立国遣返委员会执行其合法职务和责任的权利正如我方五月七日方案所规定的：
    第一、自然是为控制在其临时管辖下的战俘所必需和应有的权力，亦即你方在五月六日所说的为保证对战俘的安全和行政管理的完全控制所必需和应有的权利。第二、是进行安排，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利在自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的四个月期限内，派人前往此项战俘的原拘留地点，向一切依附于该所属国的战俘进行解释。
    第三、是负责协助一切要求遣返回家的未被直接遣返的战俘迅速返回祖国。
    （三）关于中立国遣返委员会及其附属机构的议事规则，我们认为这个委员会及其附属机构在执行上述职务时一般地不会发生争执，但如果发生争执，应以多数同意的决定为有效。
    （四）你方所提出的其他问题，大都属于细节安排的性质。一旦双方对我方五月七日方案的主要问题达成协议后，细节安排可以在合理、实际并对双方公平的基础上求得解决。这些细节安排也不会因为中立国遣返委员会是由五个中立国组成而产生任何不可解决的复杂性。事实上停战协定中关于中立国监察委员会及其附属机构的规定，已经对这类问题取得了双方满意的解决。”
    南日大将并指出：“为了迅速解决战俘遣返问题，实现朝鲜停战，我方在五月七日方案中采取了对方所提出的将不直接遣返的战俘留在朝鲜的前提。我们认为双方应该对我方五月七日方案所包含的主要问题迅速达成协议，以便立即进入具体细节安排的讨论。”
    对方在五月十日会上，对于一些具体细节安排问题又提出了若干询问，但对我方五月七日方案并未表示态度。
    双方定于五月十一日上午十一时继续举行双方代表团大会。
