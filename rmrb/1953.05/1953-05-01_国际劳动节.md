    International Labor Day
    Soviet Union  Yi·Buleishefusiqi
    May Day has already become a traditional festival for working people in all countries. Not only do the people of all ethnic groups who have been liberated from social and national oppression celebrate it, but also those who are still fighting for their liberation celebrate it.
    May Day is a day for the fighting review of the power of the working people, and a day for summarizing their achievements and the paths they have traveled. On this day, the working people unite more closely in the struggle for freedom and a happy life, and for peace and democracy.
    This year, when the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet state commemorate the great leader and teacher of all working people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, and lower their flags, they are celebrating May Day with all the new achievements in peaceful construction and in the construction of communism. The Soviet people are looking to the future with confidence. They know that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, created and nurtured by the greatest geniuses of mankind, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, is leading the country along the path of Lenin and Stalin towards the bright peak of communism. The Soviet people unite their ranks around the Communist Party, around the tested close students and comrades of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, around the Soviet government, increasing the wealth of their socialist motherland, strengthening its power and defending it against enemy invasion.
    In the cities and villages of the Soviet Union, the slogans and banners of the May Day demonstrations are filled with figures illustrating all the new achievements in economic and cultural construction, and cite the names of thousands of production innovators in industry, agriculture and construction. The labor enthusiasm, initiative and the power to build a life of those people of all ethnic groups who have been liberated from the shackles of capitalism is immeasurable. Using the latest scientific inventions, expanding production, improving technology and mechanizing the labor process, especially the arduous production process, the Soviet people are constantly improving their welfare level.
    A month ago, the Soviet Union implemented the sixth reduction in state retail prices of food and manufactured goods since the end of the Second World War. This is another big step forward in improving the material living conditions of the Soviet people. As a result of this price reduction (April 1, 1953), the Soviet people will benefit no less than 53 billion rubles. In 1951, the actual income of workers and staff had already exceeded the level of 1940 by about 57 percent, and the actual income of farmers had increased by 60 percent. In 1952, the actual income of workers and staff increased by 7 percent compared with 1951, and the actual income of farmers increased by 8 percent. This new price reduction is another proof of the superiority of the Soviet socialist system, in which the people themselves are the masters of all the welfare created by the people, and the working people are the center of care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.
    On May Day, the great Chinese people, who have been liberated from imperialist oppression and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the working people of the European people's democratic countries, together with the Soviet people, are summarizing all their achievements in peaceful labor.
    The United Nations Secretariat, in its recently published "Report on the International Economic Situation in 1951-1952," was also forced to acknowledge the achievements of the economic development of the People's Republic of China. The authors of the report pointed out that in 1952, the average index of industrial production in China was 126 percent of the level of 1951. "The high speed of production during this period," the report said, "is reflected in the recovery of the economy destroyed by the war, and in the leap forward in the initial stage of industrialization. … With the increase in industrial production, the production of agricultural products has also increased. Between 1950 and 1952, the total index of agricultural production increased by 15 percent annually. The grain harvest in 1952 was 9 percent higher than the highest harvest in 1936.”
    The facts of the people's democracies in the East and West are vivid examples of the great achievements that the working people who have been liberated from imperialist oppression and have become masters of their own destiny can achieve in a short period of time.
    Let the richest country in the most developed capitalist countries, which spends tons of paper promoting its "way of life," talk eloquently about how much the material welfare of the working people has improved and how cheap prices have become after the Second World War! But in the capitalist world, no country's workers can live a good life. For example, in early 1952, the consumption of major nutrients per capita in the United States decreased compared with 1946 by approximately the following proportions: butter 7.6 percent, meat 10 percent, fresh fruit 13.9 percent, wheat flour 14.7 percent, coffee 17.6 percent. Of course, this reduction in consumption does not include those millionaires and billionaires who are indifferent to rising food prices.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the colonies and dependent countries are in an increasingly miserable state of life. The London "Times" reported that a family of five in Malaya needs 214 Malayan dollars to maintain a minimum standard of living per month. However, if a family has two people working (such happy families are rare), then their maximum monthly wage income is only 180 Malayan dollars. The cost of living for each person in Northern Rhodesia is at least six pounds. However, the monthly wage of each African worker working in the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia is only three pounds. In the countries of Latin America, the living standards of the working people are declining sharply. In August 1952, the cost of living in Paraguay was 34 times higher than in 1938. The Brazilian "People's Daily" said that the average minimum cost of living in 1952 increased by 56 percent, but wages increased by only 9 percent during the same period.
    This is only a small part of the material illustrating the two opposite conclusions in the fate of ordinary people – on the one hand, in socialist and democratic countries, and on the other hand, in capitalist countries.
    The Korean people are celebrating May Day under the special circumstances of defending their independence. The Korean and Chinese people, who are fighting for the sovereignty of their motherland, are preventing the expansion of the war to new regions. They are demonstrating the power of the people's resistance to the unbridled war mongers. It is futile to try to subdue those people who have risen up to fight for their independence. On May Day, all peace-loving people unite and demand an end to the Korean War and the right for all people to live according to their own wishes. The louder the call for peace in Korea from all people of good will, the sooner even those who do not want to hear this call will hear it, and the sooner the worries of Korean women – mothers for their children will be eliminated every minute.
    A few days ago, Ghosh, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, correctly wrote: "In a new world war, the people of all ethnic groups in the colonies who are already living in hunger and bearing burdens that they cannot bear will suffer even greater disasters."
    The cause of peace is a cause that is vital to all people. The people of all countries in the world, regardless of race, color, ethnicity and religious belief, are yearning for peace and are fighting selflessly for peace. For this reason, the words "Long live peace between the people of all ethnic groups!" burn like flames on the banners of the May Day parades and demonstrations.

    国际劳动节
    苏联  依·布雷舍夫斯基
    “五一”已经是世界各国劳动人民的传统节日了。不仅是从社会和民族压迫下获得解放的各族人民庆祝它，就是为自己解放还在进行斗争的人们也在庆祝它。
    “五一”节是劳动人民力量的战斗检阅的日子，是对他们的成就和他们走过的道路作出总结的日子。这一天，劳动人民在为争取自由与幸福生活，为争取和平与民主的斗争中更紧密地团结起来。
    今年，苏维埃国家的各族人民，在纪念所有劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师约·维·斯大林而垂下自己的旗帜的时候，正以在和平建设性的劳动中和在共产主义建设中的一切新成就来庆祝“五一”节。苏联人民正满怀信心地注视着未来。他们知道，由人类最伟大的天才乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林所缔造和培育的苏联共产党，正领导国家沿着列宁、斯大林的道路向着共产主义光辉的顶峰前进。苏联人民把自己的队伍团结在共产党的周围，团结在约·维·斯大林的久经考验的亲近学生和战友的周围，团结在苏联政府的周围，增加着自己社会主义祖国的财富，加强它的威力并保卫它以防敌人侵犯。
    在苏联各城乡“五一”示威游行的标语牌和横帜上面，写着说明关于在经济和文化建设中的一切新成就的数字，并举出在工农业和在建设中成千上万生产革新者的名字。从资本主义镣铐下解放出来的各族人民的劳动热情、主动精神和建设生活的力量是不可估量的。利用着最新的科学发明、扩大生产、完善技术并使劳动过程首先是使费力的生产过程机械化起来的苏联人民，正把自己的福利水平日益提高起来。
    在一个月前，苏联国内实施了第二次世界大战结束后的第六次减低食品和制成品国家零售价格。这是在改善苏联人物质生活条件道路上新迈出的一大步。由于这次（一九五三年四月一日）的减低物价，可使苏联人民得到为数不下五百三十亿卢布的利益。一九五一年工人和职员的实际收入就已超过一九四○年的水平约百分之五十七左右，农民的实际收入增加了百分之六十。一九五二年工人和职员的实际收入较一九五一年增加了百分之七，农民的实际收入增加了百分之八。这次新的减低物价是苏维埃社会主义制度优越性的又一次证明，在这个社会主义制度国家内，人民本身是由人民所创造的一切福利的主人，劳动的人们是共产党和苏联政府关怀底中心。
    在“五一”节日里，从帝国主义压迫和国民党反动派统治下解放出来的伟大的中国人民，和欧洲各人民民主国家的劳动人民，同苏联人民一起，作出自己在和平劳动中一切成就的总结。
    联合国秘书处在不久前所发表的“一九五一——一九五二年内国际经济情况报告”中，也迫不得已承认中华人民共和国经济发展的成就。这个报告的作者指出说，一九五二年，中国的工业生产平均指数为一九五一年水平的百分之一百二十六。“在这时期内生产的高速度，——在该报告中说——反映在被战争所破坏的经济的恢复上面，以及工业化最初阶段的飞跃发展上面。……随着工业生产的增加，农产品的生产也增加了。在一九五○年和一九五二年期间内，每年农产品生产的总指数增加了百分之十五。一九五二年谷物收获量较一九三六年最高收获量多出百分之九。”
    东方和西方各人民民主国家的事实，就是从帝国主义压迫下解放出来而成为自己命运的主人的劳动人民能够在短短期间内获得巨大成就的生动例子。
    让那个为了宣传自己的“生活方式”而耗去成吨纸张的、最发达的资本主义国家中的最富足国家，信口开河地来述说他们在第二次世界大战后劳动人民的物质福利改善到怎样程度和物价已便宜到怎样程度吧！可是在资本主义世界内，没有任何国家的劳动者能过着美好生活。例如，一九五二年初美国按人口计算的主要营养品的消费和一九四六年相较，减少的比例大约如下：牛油百分之七点六，肉类百分之十，新鲜果物百分之十三点九，小麦粉百分之十四点七，咖啡百分之十七点六。当然，这种消费的减少，是不包括那些对营养品涨价泰然自若的百万富翁和亿万富翁在内的。
    殖民地和附属国的各族人民是处在日趋悲惨的生活状态中。伦敦的“泰晤士报”报道称，在马来亚一个五口之家维持每月最低限度的生活，需要二百一十四块马来亚金元。可是，假如一个家庭有两个人在工作的话（像这样幸福的家庭很少），那末他们每月最大的工资收入只有一百八十块马来亚金元。北罗得西亚每个人的生活费起码需要六英镑。而在北罗得西亚铜矿做工的每个非洲工人的每月工资不过三英镑。在拉丁美洲各国内，劳动人民的生活水平正急剧地降低着。一九五二年八月，巴拉圭的生活费用较一九三八年高出三十四倍。巴西的“人民报”说，在一九五二年的平均最低生活费用上涨了百分之五十六，可是在同一时期内工资却仅仅增加了百分之九。
    这只不过是说明在普通人们的命运中——一方面是在社会主义和民主国家中，另一方面在资本主义国家中——两个正相反的总结的一小部分材料罢了。
    朝鲜人民在保卫自己独立的特殊情况下，来庆祝“五一”节。为自己祖国的主权而斗争的朝、中人民正在防止战争扩大到新的地域去。他们对胡作非为的战争贩子们表现出人民反抗的力量。想使那些为自己独立而奋起斗争的人民屈服，是徒然的。在“五一”节日里，所有爱好和平的人民团结起来，要求停止朝鲜战争并赋予一切人民按照自己的愿望来生活的权利，这种呼声是越来越响亮了。如果一切有善良意志的人们对于朝鲜的和平要求得越坚决，那末甚至就连那些不愿听到这个呼声的人们也会听见得越快，朝鲜妇女——母亲每分钟为自己孩子的担忧也将消除得越快。
    前几天，印度共产党总书记高士正确地写道：“在新的世界大战中，现在就已经过着饥饿生活和肩负着力不能胜的负担的殖民地各族人民，将遭到更大的灾难”。
    和平事业是全体人民生命攸关的事业。世界各国人民，不问种族、肤色、民族和宗教信仰，都在渴望着和平，并且正为争取和平而奋不顾身地斗争着。正因为如此，在“五一”节的游行示威的旗帜上火焰般地燃烧着这样的字句：“各族人民之间的和平万岁！”
