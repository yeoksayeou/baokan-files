Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 26th: Zhejiang Province has achieved a universal bumper wheat harvest this year. The average yield across the province has increased by more than 10% compared to last year, marking the highest yield since liberation. In the Jinhua Special District, the improved wheat variety – "Yangmai" – cultivated in various counties is expected to reach a maximum yield of 128 jin per mu. Wheat harvesting commenced in mid-May in the coastal counties of Wenzhou and Taizhou Special Districts, as well as in Jinhua, Lanxi, and other areas. Harvesting is currently underway in the Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other Special Districts east of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The amount of wheat entering the market is increasing daily. In Jinhua and Lanxi counties, the daily market volume reaches approximately 3,000 to 4,000 jin at its peak. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government's Grain Bureau has initiated procurement efforts in the wheat-producing regions. In addition to relying on local grain companies for procurement, it has also entrusted nearly 1,800 grassroots cooperatives throughout the province to carry out the purchasing.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 26th: Yunnan Province's spring harvest crops have entered the market in large quantities, and local grain departments and cooperatives are carrying out planned procurement.

Most of Yunnan's spring crops, such as beans and wheat, have achieved a bumper harvest this year. Before the spring crops hit the market, the Provincial People's Government's Grain Bureau signed entrusted procurement contracts with cooperatives. Grain departments in various localities have established purchasing stations in major production areas and dispatched mobile purchasing teams to regions with difficult transportation. The purchasing team of the Wuding County Grain Department has travelled as far as the Lisu ethnic minority areas along the Jinsha River for procurement. Recently, there has been a large volume of broad beans and wheat entering the market in southern and eastern Yunnan. After procuring grain, local cooperatives and purchasing teams also supply the various ethnic farmers with large quantities of agricultural tools and fertilizers.
