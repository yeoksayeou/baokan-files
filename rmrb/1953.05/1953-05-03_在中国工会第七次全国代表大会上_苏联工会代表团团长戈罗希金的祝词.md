On the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions of China
Congratulatory Speech by Goroshkin, Head of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation

Dear Comrades:

Entrusted by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, we extend our heartfelt and fraternal congratulations to you—the representatives of the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions of China, and through you to the great Chinese people.

Your congress is convened precisely at a time when the Chinese people have achieved great victories in building a new life.

The victory of the Chinese people's revolution, which forever eliminated the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, has led the Chinese people onto a new path—the path of building a free and happy life.

In a short period, the working people of China have achieved brilliant successes in the recovery and development of industry, transportation, and agriculture. By the end of 1952, industrial and agricultural production had reached pre-war levels, with many industrial and agricultural products exceeding pre-war levels. Based on the achievements in economic construction, the material and cultural living standards of the working people are also constantly improving.

The victorious completion of the economic recovery work has created conditions for the transition to planned development of the national economy based on industrialization, and enables you to launch large-scale work from 1953 onwards to ensure the further development of industry, transportation, and agriculture, the development of culture and education, and the improvement of the material welfare of the people.

The Soviet working people watch your work with infinite concern and sympathy, and are sincerely delighted with the achievements you have made in building a strong people's democratic country under the leadership of the heroic Communist Party and your long-tested leader Comrade Mao Zedong.

Your achievements also bring sincere joy to freedom-loving people all over the world, because they regard the establishment and consolidation of the People's Republic of China as a victory for the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

The Soviet people, closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, are striving with the greatest enthusiasm to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The Soviet people have a noble aspiration: to dedicate all their strength, experience, and knowledge to the complete victory of the great cause of Lenin and Stalin.

In this construction endeavor of the Soviet people, trade unions play a huge and glorious role.

In all our enterprises, the nationwide socialist competition led by trade unions is blazing like a growing fire.

Male and female workers are successfully carrying out competitions, striving to complete plans ahead of schedule, improve product quality, save raw materials and materials, and strive for socialist accumulation beyond the plan. Our laborers receive comrade-like assistance from trade union organizations in implementing their socialist competition conditions.

In Soviet enterprises, there is a dense network of schools of various types, such as Stakhanov schools, young workers' schools, various training classes and study groups, as well as affiliated night schools and correspondence courses of specialized technical schools and various universities, which enable workers and staff to receive secondary and higher education without leaving production, and improve their own production technology.

The results of socialist competition are reflected in the tremendous achievements in the development of the national economy.

The summary of the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the past two years brilliantly confirms that the Soviet people are victoriously realizing the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and implementing the genius instructions of our leader and teacher Comrade Stalin on the road from socialism to communism.

Soviet industry overfulfilled the 1952 plan, with total output increasing by 11 percent compared to 1951. In our country, the industry producing means of production has developed particularly rapidly, and the total output in 1952 has exceeded the pre-war level by about 1.7 times.

Soviet machine manufacturing produced more than twice as many machines and equipment last year as in 1940 before the war.

The industry producing daily necessities is also expanding day by day.

Socialist agriculture has also achieved extremely great results. The total grain output in 1952 reached 8 billion poods.

In the Soviet Union, expanding social production is not an end in itself, but a means to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government constantly strive to improve the material welfare of workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, and all the Soviet people.

The brilliant victories our people have achieved in the development of industrial and agricultural production have made it possible for us to implement the sixth reduction in state retail prices of food and industrial products since 1947 from April 1st this year.

The repeated reduction of retail prices has further greatly improved the living standards of all strata of people in our country, increased the real wages of workers and staff, and increased the income of farmers.

The continuous improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people clearly proves the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, which plunges working people into poverty, unemployment, and hardship due to the militarization of the national economy and the preparation for new wars.

In our country, housing and cultural facilities are being vigorously constructed. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that tens of billions of rubles will be allocated for this purpose. The Soviet people will receive newly built and well-equipped houses with an area calculated in tens of millions of square meters, and hundreds of new clubs, schools, hospitals, sanatoriums, and resorts.

The state social insurance managed by trade unions is a powerful lever to improve the material welfare of our employees.

In 1953, the state allocated more than 22.5 billion rubles for social insurance.

The funds allocated for pensions, seniority bonuses, temporary loss of labor subsidies, and pregnancy and childbirth subsidies will amount to more than 19.5 billion rubles.

In 1953, nearly three million employees received treatment and rest in trade union sanatoriums, with expenses paid from social insurance funds. In the summer, more than five million Soviet children will go to Young Pioneer summer camps and villas for rest. The working people of the Soviet Union can go to medical institutions for free medical treatment.

The continuous improvement of the material and cultural level of the Soviet working people more convincingly illustrates than any words the peaceful direction of the Soviet economic development.

The Soviet working people are committed to peaceful construction labor, and they are concerned with establishing a lasting and solid peace. The Soviet government, representing the will of all our people, is doing everything possible to stop new wars, prevent the bloodshed of millions of people, and ensure the peaceful construction of a happy life.

The greatest victory of the people of all countries in the world has established a strong camp of peace, democracy, and socialism for the first time in world history. Now, this camp of peace-loving countries has 800 million people.

Our sacred duty is to defend and consolidate the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, strengthen the unity of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace, and expand and unite the ranks of peace defenders.

The alliance and friendship between the people of the two great powers, the great People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, are of particularly great significance in the struggle to defend world peace.

Peace banner holder J. V. Stalin teaches: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China provides a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and is a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and the world."

The Soviet trade union believes that its primary task is to do its best to develop and strengthen the friendship and close cooperation between the working people of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

The fraternal friendship between our two peoples will continue to serve the cause of democracy and progress, and the cause of international peace and security. Dear Comrades!

Please allow us to congratulate you once again and wish you even greater achievements in building a strong people's democratic country.

Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

Long live the Chinese working class!

Long live the great unity of the working people of all countries fighting for peace and democracy!

    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上
    苏联工会代表团团长戈罗希金的祝词亲爱的同志们：
    我们受全苏工会中央理事会的委托，向你们——中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表，并通过你们向伟大的中国人民致以衷心的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    你们的大会是正当中国人民在建设新生活中获得巨大胜利的时候召开的。
    中国人民革命的胜利，永远地消灭了帝国主义和封建主义的压迫，它引导了中国人民走上一条新的道路——建设自由、幸福生活的道路。
    中国的劳动人民在短短的期间里，在恢复与发展工业、运输和农业各方面获得了辉煌的成就。到一九五二年底，工农业生产已达战前水平，其中并有许多种工农业产品超过了战前水平。在经济建设的成就的基础上，劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平也正不断地提高。
    经济恢复工作的胜利完成，为在工业化的基础上过渡到有计划地发展国民经济创造了条件，并且使你们能从一九五三年起大规模地展开保证进一步发展工业、运输业和农业，发展文化教育和提高人民物质福利的工作。
    苏联劳动人民怀着无限的关切和同情，注视着你们的工作，并为你们在英勇的共产党和自己的久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，在建设强大的人民民主国家的事业中所获得的成就，感到由衷的欢欣。
    你们的成就，同样地使全世界爱好自由的人民感到衷心的喜悦，因为他们把中华人民共和国的成立和巩固，看作是和平、民主和社会主义阵营的胜利。
    苏联人民紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围，正以最大的热情为完成第五个五年计划而努力。苏联人民怀着一种崇高的愿望。要为列宁、斯大林的伟大事业的完全胜利，献出自己所有的力量、经验和知识。
    在苏联人民这个建设事业中，工会起着巨大的、光辉的作用。
    在我国所有的企业里，工会所领导的全国性的社会主义竞赛，正像火焰一样愈来愈炽烈了。
    男女工人正顺利地开展着竞赛。争取提前完成计划，争取提高产品质量，节约原料、材料和争取超计划社会主义积累。我国的劳动者在执行自己的社会主义竞赛条件时，得到工会组织方面的同志般的帮助。
    在苏联企业里密布着各种学校网，如斯塔哈诺夫学校、青年工人学校、各种训练班和学习小组、以及专门技术学校和各种高等学校的附属夜校和函授班，这就使工人、职员能够不脱离生产而受到中等教育和高等教育，提高他们自己的生产技术。
    社会主义竞赛的成果，表现在国民经济发展的巨大的成就中。
    第五个五年计划两年来的总结光辉地证实了：苏联人民正胜利地实现着苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示，贯彻着我们的领袖和导师斯大林同志关于从社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路的天才指示。
    苏联工业超额完成了一九五二年计划，总产量较一九五一年增加了百分之十一。在我国，出产生产资料的工业发展得尤其迅速，一九五二年的总产量已超过战前水平约一·七倍。
    苏联机器制造业在去年所出产的机器和装备，较战前一九四○年多两倍多。
    生产日用必需品的工业也日益扩大。
    社会主义农业也获得了极其巨大的成绩，一九五二年粮食总产量达八十亿普特。
    在苏联，扩大社会生产本身并不是目的，而是一种用来最大限度地满足全社会经常增长的物质和文化需要的手段。
    共产党和苏联政府不断地设法改善工人、集体农民、知识分子和全体苏联人民的物质福利。
    我国人民在发展工农业生产上所获得的辉煌的胜利，使我们有可能从今年四月一日起实行一九四七年以来第六次降低食品和工业品的国家零售价格。
    再次降低零售价格，就进一步大大提高了我国各阶层人民的生活水平，提高了工人、职员的实际工资，增加了农民的收入。
    苏联人民生活水平的不断提高，明显地证明了社会主义制度优越于资本主义制度，资本主义制度因实行国民经济军事化与准备新战争使劳动人民陷于贫困、失业与艰难境地。
    在我国正大力进行住宅、文化生活设施的建设。第五个五年计划规定拨出数百亿卢布作为此项用费。苏联人民将要得到数以千万平方公尺面积计算的、新建筑的、设备完善的住宅，数百所新的俱乐部、学校、医院、疗养院和休养所。
    由工会管理的国家社会保险是提高我国职工物质福利的强有力的杠杆。
    一九五三年国家拨付社会保险事业的费用达二百二十五亿多卢布。
    为养老金、年功奖金、暂时丧失劳动力补助费、怀孕生育补助金而拨出的款项，将达一百九十五亿多卢布。
      一九五三年，将近三百万职工，在工会疗养院进行治疗与休养，费用由社会保险费中开支。在夏季将有五百多万苏联儿童到少先夏令营与别墅去休养。苏联的劳动人民可免费到医疗机关看病。
    苏联劳动人民的物质和文化水平的不断提高，比任何言词都更令人信服地说明了苏联经济发展的和平方向。
    苏联劳动人民正致力于和平建设劳动，他们关心着建立持久的巩固的和平。代表着我国全体人民意志的苏联政府，正尽一切力量制止新战争，防止千百万人民流血，以保证和平地建设幸福生活。
    世界各国人民最伟大的胜利在世界历史上第一次建立了强大的和平、民主与社会主义阵营。现在，这个爱好和平国家的阵营已有八亿人。
    我们的神圣职责就是要保卫与巩固和平、民主与社会主义阵营，加强各国人民在争取和平斗争中的团结，扩大与团结和平保卫者的队伍。
    伟大的中华人民共和国与苏联两大国人民之间的同盟和友好在保卫世界和平的斗争中，有着特别巨大的意义。
    和平旗手约·维·斯大林教导说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东与全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    苏联工会认为它的首要任务就是尽全力发展和加强中华人民共和国和苏联两国劳动人民之间的友谊与密切合作。
    我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊，今后仍将要服务于民主与进步的事业，国际和平与安全的事业。亲爱的同志们！
    请允许我们再一次祝贺你们，祝你们在建设强大的人民民主国家中，获得更进一步的成就。
    中苏两国人民之间的永恒友谊万岁！
    中国工人阶级万岁！
    为和平与民主而斗争的各国劳动人民大团结万岁！
