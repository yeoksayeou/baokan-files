Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Hydrobiology
Preliminary Results Achieved in Researching Freshwater Fish Farming
Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Hydrobiology are researching freshwater fish farming. Preliminary research results have been achieved regarding the living conditions of fish in natural waters and the prevention and treatment of fish diseases.

Rao Qinzi, a plankton expert at the Institute of Hydrobiology, and a group of researchers have studied the correlation between plankton and fish living conditions, providing a scientific basis for the planned stocking of domestic fish in natural lakes on a large scale. Last year, Rao Qinzi and others went to Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, and Xiaogan and Huanggang in Hubei Province, to investigate the types and growth of plankton in various lakes. They took live fish from the lakes for dissection, examining the food in the fish's stomachs to see which plankton were fish feed and which feeds were most easily digested by the fish. After long-term investigation and experimentation, they understood some of the environmental conditions for the survival and growth of fish in natural waters, and determined the maximum stocking density per unit area of natural water and the stocking ratio of different fish species. Taking the commonly stocked silver carp and bighead carp in various parts of China as examples, their research results show that: if each liter of water contains more than 180,000 diatoms and other phytoplankton that can be digested by silver carp, at least 150 silver carp can be stocked per mu of water; if it contains more than 30,000 zooplankton that can be digested by bighead carp, 85 bighead carp can be stocked. The stocking ratio of bighead carp to silver carp is about eight to two. If these standards can be widely promoted and applied, the losses caused by blind stocking in various places will be greatly reduced, and the utilization rate of natural water surfaces in various places will be greatly improved, achieving the goal of increased production. Rao Qinzi and other researchers recently formed a strong lake survey team and went to Hubei Province for a large-scale on-site investigation.

A group of researchers led by Ni Dashu, a protozoology expert at the Institute of Hydrobiology, is conducting research on the prevention and treatment of fish diseases in the Linghu area of Zhejiang Province. Ni Dashu and others have learned the causes of many different types of fish diseases: most of them are caused by parasitic protozoa and copepod crustaceans, and some treatment methods for fish diseases have been researched. For example, fish gill congestion, damage, and rot, caused by *Ichthyobodo necator* parasitizing the gills of grass carp (this disease can kill 80-90% of grass carp in the entire fish pond in severe cases), can be treated by using copper sulfate solution to kill *Ichthyobodo necator*. The institute's experiments on the prevention and treatment of fish diseases in Linghu focus on prevention, starting from improving aquaculture technology, and aim to basically prevent the occurrence of many major fish diseases within the next three to four years.

In order to improve the quality of fish fry and solve the difficulties in transporting fish fry, another group of experts from the institute recently went to Yichang, Hubei Province, to capture parent fish and conduct research on artificial insemination and low-temperature treatment of fish eggs.

The scientific workers of the Institute of Hydrobiology have shown great enthusiasm and a serious and responsible attitude in their work. When Rao Qinzi was conducting research on plankton in Zhejiang Province, he carried his bags and instruments along the lake all day long, measuring the types and quantities of plankton. These plankton are all smaller than one ten-millionth of a millimeter. When calculating their numbers under the microscope, they often became dizzy and their eyes watered, but they still persevered.

On the vast seas such as the East China Sea and the Bohai Sea, and in the coastal fishing grounds, a group of young fishermen and fishery technicians who have been trained in new technologies have recently emerged. This is the beginning of the new China's schools adopting the method of combining theory with practice to train aquaculture technicians. This group of fishery technicians is students of Yantai Fisheries Technical School in Shandong Province. They intern according to the different subjects they have learned in school. The 28 students in the senior fishing department were assigned to fishing vessels of Dalian, Bohai, Shanghai, and Liaodong aquatic product companies and fishery companies to carry out internship work such as drivers, purse seine, and fishing; The 49 students in the junior fishing department took turns practicing wind net fishing on the school's sailboats in batches; The 93 students in the senior and junior manufacturing departments were assigned to Bohai Fisheries Company and Yantai Branch of Shandong Aquatic Product Transportation and Marketing Company to learn fish salting; The 53 students in the junior aquaculture department went to Yantai Branch of Shandong Aquatic Product Aquaculture Farm to intern in the harvesting and seedling collection of Undaria pinnatifida, and the selection, summering, and harvesting methods of kelp. The internship period is ten to thirty-five days. The students who participated in this internship all made personal internship plans and class internship covenants.

    研究淡水鱼的养殖问题有初步成果
    中国科学院水生生物研究所的科学家们正在研究淡水鱼的养殖问题。关于天然水面鱼类生存条件和鱼病防治方面已有初步研究成果。
    水生生物研究所浮游生物专家饶钦止及一批研究人员研究了浮游生物和鱼类生活的相关条件，为大量利用天然湖泊有计划地放养家鱼提供了科学的根据。饶钦止等曾在去年到浙江省杭州、萧山、绍兴、宁波及湖北省孝感、黄冈等地，考察了各种不同湖泊中浮游生物的种类与生长情况。他们从湖泊中取出活鱼进行解剖，检查鱼的肠胃中的食物，看那些浮游生物是鱼的食料，那些食料鱼类最易消化。经过长期的调查和实验之后，了解了天然水面中鱼类生存生长的若干环境条件，确定了天然水面单位面积的最高养殖量和不同鱼类的养殖比例。如以我国各地通常放养的主要鱼类花鲢、白鲢为例，他们研究的结果是：每一升水中含有十八万以上的矽藻等能为白鲢消化的浮游植物的，每亩水面至少可以放养白鲢一百五十尾；含有能为花鲢消化的浮游动物在三万以上的，可以放养花鲢八十五尾。花鲢和白鲢的放养比例约为八比二。这些标准如能广泛推广运用，将大大减少各地因盲目放养所造成的损失，也将大大提高各地天然水面利用率，达到增产目的。饶钦止及其他研究人员最近组成了强大的湖泊调查队前往湖北省进行大规模的现场调查。
    水生生物研究所原生动物专家倪达书所率领的一批研究人员，正在浙江省菱湖地区进行防治鱼病的研究工作，倪达书等已了解了许多不同种类的鱼病原因：大部分是由于寄生的原生动物和桡脚类甲壳虫所造成的，并已研究出一些鱼病的治疗办法。如由于隐鞭虫寄生在草鱼鳃部中而引起鳃的冲血、破损和腐烂等病象（这种鱼病严重时可使整个鱼池中百分之八、九十的草鱼死亡），可用硫酸铜溶液杀死隐鞭虫来治疗。该所在菱湖进行防治鱼病的试验，重点放在预防方面，从改进养殖技术着手，要求在今后三、四年内，基本上能够防止许多种主要鱼病的发生。
    为了提高鱼苗的成色，解决鱼苗运输上的困难问题，该所另一批专家已在最近前往湖北宜昌地区，捕捉亲鱼，进行人工受精和鱼卵的低温处理等研究工作。
    水生生物研究所的科学工作者们在工作中表现了高度的热情和认真负责的工作态度。饶钦止在浙江省进行浮游生物的研究工作时，整天背着行囊和仪器走在湖边，测定浮游生物的种类和数量。这些浮游生物都是小到一千万分之一毫米以下的，在显微镜下计算它们的数目时，往往计算得头昏眼花、泪水直流，但他们仍然坚持下去。    （新华社）
    在我国东海、渤海等辽阔的海洋上和沿海的渔场上，最近出现了一批经过新式技术训练的年青的捕鱼手和渔业技术人员。这是新中国的学校采取理论结合实际的方法培养水产技术人员的开始。这批渔业技术人员就是山东省烟台水产技术学校的学生。他们根据在学校所学的不同科目进行实习，高级班渔捞科的二十八名学生，被分配到旅大、渤海、上海、辽东等水产公司和渔业公司的渔轮上，进行司机、围网、捕鱼等实习工作；初级班渔捞科的四十九名学生，分批轮流在学校的帆船上练习风网捕鱼；高级班和初级班的制造科的九十三名学生，被分配到渤海渔业公司和山东省水产运销公司烟台分公司去学习腌鱼工作；初级班养殖科五十三名学生，到山东水产养殖场烟台分场去实习裙带菜的收割、采苗，及海带的选种、渡夏和收割方法。实习时间为十天到三十五天。参加这次实习的学生都订立了个人的实习计划和班级的实习公约。
