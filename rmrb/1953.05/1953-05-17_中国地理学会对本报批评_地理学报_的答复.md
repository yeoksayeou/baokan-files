To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

The criticism made by Comrade Chen Tianmin in the People's Daily on March 24th regarding the "Acta Geographica Sinica" edited by our Society is correct and will play a certain role in promoting the future improvement and enhancement of the "Acta Geographica Sinica." Therefore, the Second Council of our Society fully agrees with this criticism and has instructed the new editorial board of "Acta Geographica Sinica" to study and strengthen the review system, strive to improve the political and ideological nature and scientific rigor of the journal; and calls on all members to continue to expose other errors as a lesson for future improvement work.

As Comrade Chen Tianmin pointed out: Since liberation, the "Acta Geographica Sinica" has continuously published some articles with very erroneous stances, viewpoints, and methods. "Although it has some achievements… but in its main aspect, it has serious shortcomings and errors." The main reason for the errors lies in the fact that the editors of the "Acta Geographica Sinica" at that time lacked an attitude of responsibility to the people and lacked or had no Marxist-Leninist cultivation. They followed the bourgeois objectivist editing methods, simply emphasizing the "academic nature" of the submissions, without questioning whether the articles had any political or ideological errors. Some people even had not yet undergone good transformation and change in their thinking and stance, so naturally they could not distinguish the errors in the articles and criticize such errors, let alone consciously introduce the advanced Soviet geographical theories. Before Volume 17, all submissions were published without exception, with almost no rejections or non-publication. Furthermore, the leadership structure of our Society at that time was extremely unsound, thus condoning the development of this error. After the great ideological remolding movement, the editing work of Volume 18 has improved somewhat, the handling of manuscripts is more cautious, and the errors committed are less than before. However, since the basic situation has not changed, its progress is still very limited. Especially due to insufficient understanding of the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, the articles of self-examination published in Volume 18 of the "Acta Geographica Sinica" were all passive and therefore not profound.

On January 26th of this year, the Geographical Society held its first National Congress in Beijing, discussing the tasks of the two journals of our Society. It was decided that the task of the "Acta Geographica Sinica" is to combine the needs of national economic construction and improve the level of geographical science; "Geographical Knowledge" is responsible for serving the geography teaching and geography popularization work in primary and secondary schools. The congress rectified the general affairs of the Society, elected a new council, and then reorganized the editorial board of the "Acta Geographica Sinica." The editorial department was also moved from Nanjing to Beijing. The new editorial board has formulated the editorial policy of the "Acta Geographica Sinica" according to the tasks decided by the congress. In the future, the main contents of the "Acta Geographica Sinica" will be: introduction of advanced theories and practical working methods of Soviet geographical science, specialized papers and important materials of domestic geographers. And strengthen planning, ideology and scientific rigor, and gradually improve the quality of the journal.

However, in order to fundamentally promote the progress of geographical science, it is necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism. If we want to improve "Acta Geographica Sinica" and "Geographical Knowledge," not only should members actively submit articles, criticize each other, and engage in debates, but also the vast number of readers should regularly supervise these two journals. Only in this way can they be continuously improved.

### 中国地理学会对本报批评“地理学报”的答复

    中国地理学会对本报批评“地理学报”的答复人民日报编辑部：
    三月二十四日人民日报所载陈天民同志对本会编辑的“地理学报”所提出的批评是正确的，对“地理学报”今后的改进和提高，会起一定的推动作用。因此本会二届理事会完全同意这个批评，已指示“地理学报”新的编辑委员会研究加强审稿制度，努力提高该刊的政治思想性与科学性；并号召全体会员，继续揭发其他错误，作为今后改进工作的借镜。
    诚如陈天民同志所指出的：解放以来的“地理学报”，连续刊登了一些立场、观点、方法都很错误的文章。“虽然它有一点成绩……但就其主要的一面来说，它却存在着严重的缺点和错误。”产生错误的主要原因，在于当时“地理学报”的编辑缺乏对人民负责的态度，缺少或者没有马克思列宁主义的修养。他们因袭着资产阶级客观主义的编辑方法，单纯地强调来稿的“学术性”，而不问稿子在政治上思想上有无错误。甚至有些人在思想上、立场上还没有很好的改造和转变，自然就不能辨别文章的错误所在和批判这种错误，更说不上有意识地介绍苏联先进的地理学理论了。在第十七卷以前，所有来稿一律刊载，几乎没有退稿或不登的。并且本会当时的领导机构也极不健全，因而就纵容了这种错误的发展。经过伟大的思想改造运动以后，第十八卷的编辑工作有了一些改进，处理稿件比较审慎，所犯的错误也较前减少了。但因基本情况未变，其进步还极有限。特别是对于批评与自我批评的武器认识不足，所以第十八卷“地理学报”上所刊登的自我检讨的文章，全系出于被动，因而也是不深刻的。
    今年一月二十六日，地理学会在北京举行了第一届全国代表大会，讨论了本会两个刊物的任务。决定“地理学报”以结合国家经济建设需要，提高地理科学水平为任务；“地理知识”担任服务中小学地理教学和地理普及工作。大会整顿了总会会务，选举出新的理事会，随即进行了“地理学报”编委会的改组工作。编辑部亦由南京迁设北京。新编委会已根据代表大会所决定的任务，拟定了“地理学报”编辑方针。今后“地理学报”的主要内容为：介绍苏联地理科学的先进理论与实际工作方法，国内地理工作者的专门论文和重要资料。并加强计划性、思想性和科学性，逐步提高刊物的质量。
    但是要想在根本上推动地理科学的进步，必须开展批评与自我批评。要想把“地理学报”和“地理知识”搞好，不仅会员要踊跃投稿、互相批评、展开争论，而且还需广大读者经常对这两种刊物进行监督。只有这样，才能使它们不断地得到改进。
