Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 15th: Prime Minister Nehru today made a statement on foreign policy in the People's Assembly. Nehru said: "Since the last time this House discussed foreign affairs, many things have happened internationally, and there have been many important developments. No major issue has been resolved yet, but it can be said that for the first time in several years, so many people are hoping to find a solution. The 'Cold War' has eased somewhat. There have been many demonstrations of this new attitude on the Soviet side, and no matter how some may view these demonstrations, they must be seen as helpful in easing world tensions and are welcome. China has also shown a clear willingness to peacefully resolve the Korean issue."

Referring to the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of India's resolution on the Korean issue last December, Prime Minister Nehru said: "Recently, the Chinese government put forward new proposals on the Korean issue, which are, to some extent, consistent with the resolutions passed by the United Nations, and it opened the door to a new solution to the Korean issue. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese government put forward new proposals, the so-called eight-point plan, which are very similar to the Indian resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. We welcome these proposals because they seem to provide us with such a promising and solid foundation for resolving pressing issues, a foundation that is in line with the accepted United Nations policy. Many other countries also welcome these suggestions.

"Two or three days ago, the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command put forward some counter-proposals. Any constructive effort to solve this problem is always welcome. Therefore, we are very pleased that this effort is being made to solve problems that have caused so much trouble in the past. After carefully studying these counter-proposals, it can be seen that they are very different from the United Nations General Assembly resolution that the United Nations still abides by. The Chinese and North Korean governments seem to have indicated that they disagree with some parts of the proposals and stated that they cannot accept these proposals as they are.

"As far as India is concerned, we welcome any solution accepted by the parties concerned. But we believe that such a solution is likely to be achieved based on the United Nations resolution, and China's eight-point plan is very similar to this resolution and should be used as a basis for discussion, and we hope to obtain a solution. When necessary, it should be possible to supplement and amend this plan by agreement. Therefore, we earnestly hope that this solution will not be abandoned, but should continue along this path."

The Indian Prime Minister also said: "In some parts of this plan, India is often mentioned, and the plan suggests that India should assume various responsibilities. We are reluctant to assume responsibilities in distant places. But if an agreement is reached between the parties concerned, and the tasks suggested to be borne by us are within our capabilities and do not violate the policies we pursue, then we do not want to evade this responsibility. Because India is fortunate to maintain friendly relations with the major powers on both sides of the dispute, this responsibility is even greater. If India can contribute to the cause of peace, we will be happy to contribute our strength. But we can only contribute this strength when an agreement is reached on a solution."

Speaking of the current world situation, Nehru said: "There is no doubt that there is now a new atmosphere in the world, and the future is brighter than it has been for a long time. Politicians all over the world, especially those who bear heavy responsibilities in the major powers, should seize this opportunity with courage and wisdom to guide mankind towards peace. I am very happy that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom recently suggested holding a summit conference of the world's major powers, a conference that is informal, confidential, and has no rigid agenda, so as to discuss the problems that plague mankind and try to find ways to free mankind from the fear of war. I would like to express my sincere support for this suggestion."

### 尼赫鲁发表外交问题声明  主张将我方建议作为朝鲜停战谈判基础  赞同召开大国最高级会议讨论和平问题

    尼赫鲁发表外交问题声明
    主张将我方建议作为朝鲜停战谈判基础
    赞同召开大国最高级会议讨论和平问题
    【新华社十五日讯】据印度新闻处新德里十五日电，尼赫鲁总理今天在人民院发表外交问题声明。尼赫鲁说：“自从上次本院讨论外交问题以来，国际上发生了许多事，有了许多重要的发展。还没有一个重大问题已经获得解决，但是可以说，好几年来第一次有这么多人希望找到解决的办法。‘冷战’已经多少缓和了一些。苏联方面已经有了许多这种新态度的证明，不论某些人可能怎样看待这些证明，必须认为这是有助于缓和世界紧张形势并值得欢迎的。中国也已有了和平解决朝鲜问题的明显意愿。”
    尼赫鲁总理在谈到联合国大会在去年十二月间通过印度所提的关于朝鲜问题的决议案后说：“最近中国政府就朝鲜问题提出了新的建议，这些建议在某种程度上与联合国通过的决议是一致的，它为朝鲜问题的新解决办法打开了大门。其后不久，中国政府提出了新的建议，这就是一般所说的八点方案，这些建议与联合国大会所通过的印度决议非常近似。我们欢迎这些建议，因为这些建议似乎给我们在解决迫切的问题上提供了这样一个有希望的坚实的基础，这个基础符合于已被接受的联合国政策。许多其他国家也欢迎这些建议。
    “两三天以前，朝鲜联军司令部提出了某些反建议。任何解决这个问题的建设性努力总是值得欢迎的。因此，我们很高兴正进行这种努力以解决在过去曾引起许多麻烦的问题。仔细研究这些反建议后，可以看出它们和联合国现在还遵守的联合国大会决议是有很大差别的。中国和北朝鲜政府似乎已表示它们不同意建议中的某些部分，并声明照目前的样子它们是不能接受这些建议的。 “就印度而论，我们欢迎为有关方面所接受的任何解决办法。但我们认为，这种解决办法很可能根据联合国决议而获致，而中国的八点方案与这个决议非常近似，它应作为讨论的基础，我们希望能获得一个解决办法。在必要的时候，经过协议来对这个方案加以补充修正应该是可能的。因此，我们热切希望不要放弃这个解决途径，而应继续沿着这个途径走。”
    印度总理又说：“在这个方案中的某些部分，印度时常被提到，方案并建议印度应担负各种职责。我们不情愿在遥远的地方担负责任。但如果有关方面间达成协议，而建议由我们负担的任务是我们力所能及的，并且又不违反我们所奉行的政策，那么我们并不想逃避这个责任。由于印度很幸运，与争端双方的大国都保持友好关系，这个责任便更加重大了。如果印度能为和平事业有所贡献的话，我们将很高兴贡献我们的力量。但是只有在解决办法方面达成协议的时候，我们才能贡献这种力量。”
    尼赫鲁谈到目前世界形势时说：“毫无疑问现在世界上已有了新的气氛，前途比起过去一个长时期来要光明些。现在全世界的政治家，尤其是那些在大国肩负重大责任的政治家应该以勇敢和明智的精神抓紧这个时机引导人类走向和平。我很高兴：联合王国的首相最近建议召开世界大国最高级会议一事，这个会议不拘于形式，有秘密性，没有死板的议程，就这样来讨论折磨着人类的问题并尽力设法使人类免于战争的恐惧。我愿热诚地表示赞同这个建议。”
