The CCP Longyou County Propaganda Department held a meeting of propaganda officers from each district on April 30th to inspect the learning situation of cadres in the county's districts and townships. The inspection results revealed that most districts and townships in the county lacked a regular learning system, and there was a serious phenomenon of laissez-faire in learning.

First, responsible cadres at the district and township levels do not sufficiently recognize the importance of learning. Many cadres emphasize being busy with work, focusing only on assigning tasks and not paying attention to understanding the spirit of instructions from higher levels, so as to improve the cadres' policy concepts and improve work methods. Most district party committee secretaries in the county did not personally lead cadre learning, and some responsible cadres even refused to learn. For example, Zhao Jinyi, the head of Guantang District, did not participate in learning. When cadres in the district raised opinions in the bulletin board, he ignored them. Later, the cadres posted the written opinions in his bedroom. After seeing it, he not only did not admit his mistake but also lost his temper with everyone. Chen Ruixiang, deputy secretary of the Tashi District Committee, is a typical example of ignoring learning and working blindly. When Comrade He Zhangde, the district's propaganda officer, returned to the district from the county on April 20th to convey the county committee's arrangement for studying the CCP Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, he said, "Where is this document?" When Comrade He opened the newspaper and pointed it out to him, he said, "Oh! I didn't see it." Because of the lack of attention to learning, Comrade Chen Ruixiang showed a hardworking but bureaucratic work style. The county committee inspected his leadership work for five days from April 22nd to 26th and found that he was running around blindly all day, holding meetings everywhere to grasp work, but as a result, he did not solve any problems. When the propaganda cadres reported to him the county committee's instructions on learning, he always casually agreed, "That's good," "Okay," but did not pay attention to it. The district propaganda officer requested that he add a learning item when stipulating that the cadres below report their work, but the request was not implemented, so the learning in the entire district did not start for a long time.

Secondly, some district propaganda officers have also not taken on the responsibility of guiding learning, simply relying on the leadership and emphasizing that the leadership does not pay attention, so they do not care. Past experience has proved that as long as the propaganda officers take the initiative to take responsibility, take the lead in learning, frequently urge the leaders, and insist on inspection and criticism, they can also greatly promote learning.

The county party committee propaganda department pointed out during the inspection of learning that the occurrence of the above-mentioned situations is inseparable from the county committee's lack of specific leadership in learning. The key to improving learning lies in strengthening supervision and inspection of the learning of district and township-level leading cadres, and stipulating that every rural work cadre must adhere to at least one hour of learning every day. The county party committee propaganda department decided to strengthen specific guidance on learning, adopt the methods of criticism and commendation, and fight against all thoughts of not learning or not paying attention to learning. Through this inspection, the learning situation of cadres throughout the county has begun to improve in studying the CCP Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and other documents. Some districts have, according to the county party committee's deployment, inspected the erroneous attitudes towards learning, corrected the bad phenomenon of leading cadres not participating in learning, and formulated learning plans and systems.

    中共龙游县委宣传部检查区乡干部学习情况
    中共浙江省龙游县委宣传部，在四月三十日召集各区宣传干事会，检查了该县区乡干部的学习情况。检查结果，说明该县大部分区乡没有经常的学习制度，学习上存在着严重的自流现象。
    首先，区乡级负责干部对学习的重要性认识不足，许多干部强调工作忙，只注意布置任务，不注意领会上级指示的精神，以提高干部的政策观念，改进工作方法。全县大部分区委书记没有亲自领导干部学习，某些负责干部甚至拒绝学习。如官潭区区长赵金义同志不参加学习，该区干部在布告栏中提出意见，他也不加理会。后来干部把意见书贴在他的寝室里，他看到后不但不承认错误，还向大家发一顿脾气。塔石区委副书记陈瑞祥是忽视学习盲目工作的典型。当四月二十日该区宣传干事何樟德同志从县里回区，传达县委布置学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议时，他说：“那里有这个文件？”当何同志翻开报纸指给他看时，他才说：“噢！我没有看见。”由于不注意学习，陈瑞祥同志在工作上表现辛辛苦苦的官僚主义作风，县委检查他四月二十二日至二十六日五天时间的领导工作，发现他整日盲目奔跑，到处开会抓工作，结果没有解决什么问题。宣传干部向他汇报县委对学习的指示，他总是随口答应：“这样好”“行”，但没有引起重视，该区宣传干事要求他在规定下面干部汇报工作时，加上学习一项，结果也没有贯彻，因此全区学习很长时间没有开展起来。
    其次，有些区宣传干事也没有负起指导学习的责任，单纯依赖领导，强调领导不重视，自己就不管。过去的情况证明：只要宣传干事主动负责，带头学习，经常督促领导，坚持检查批评，对学习也可以起很大推动作用。
    县委宣传部在检查学习时指出：上列这些情况的产生和县委对学习缺乏具体领导是分不开的。改进学习的关键在于对区乡级领导干部的学习加强督促检查，并规定每一农村工作干部每日至少坚持一小时的学习。县委宣传部决定加强对学习的具体指导，采用批评与表扬的方法，和一切不学习或不重视学习的思想作斗争。通过这次检查，目前全县干部在学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等文件中，学习情况开始好转。有的区已根据县委的部署，检查了对学习的错误态度，纠正了领导干部不参加学习的不良现象，订出了学习计划和制度。
