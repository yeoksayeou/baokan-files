    Do a Good Job of Exploring the Motherland's Underground Treasures
    Liu Wanlu, Deputy Head of the Ma Wenzhi Drilling Team, Fuxin Coal Mine
    Representative of Liaoxi Province attending the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    I am the deputy head of the Ma Wenzhi Drilling Team. Since the Red May of the year before last, under the guidance of Soviet experts, our team has learned the advanced Soviet experiences of rapid drilling and using yellow mud slurry. We have increased the rotation speed of the fast wheel of the drilling machine from 233 revolutions per minute to 274 revolutions per minute; the middle wheel from 140 revolutions to 164 revolutions; and the slow wheel from 80 revolutions to 98 revolutions. The yellow mud slurry preserves the well walls and prevents accidents. We have successively created several national records in drilling efficiency.
    In 1952, our team drilled a total of more than 2,500 meters, completing more than 118 percent of the state-revised plan.
    Although our drilling efficiency is very fast, and we have overfulfilled the state's task in terms of quantity, our quality is very poor. The core recovery rate is far from the state's requirements. Taking last year as an example, the highest coal core recovery rate of our team was no more than 67.8 percent, the lowest was only 10 percent, and the annual average was 29 percent.
    Geological drilling is mainly for exploring underground mineral reserves. Coal miners respectfully call us the "eyes of the coal mining industry" or "mining vanguards." This means that we are their pioneers, and our task is to provide reliable underground data for them to mine. However, what we have done in the past is far from enough. We only paid attention to speed and not quality, and we did not clearly understand what the purpose of drilling holes was. When leaders came to inspect our work, they only asked about the drilling speed and not about the recovered rock cores and coal cores. We, the team leaders, only checked how much each shift had progressed and never asked about the quality. This kind of work attitude is very wrong. From the materials of the recent National Coal Mine Drilling Conference, this tendency is common in coal mine drilling work throughout the country. This phenomenon must not be allowed to continue.
    In order to welcome Red May and the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, our team has formulated various systems and improved operating methods to ensure that the rock core recovery rate will be above 85 percent and the coal core recovery rate will be above 70 percent in the future. In April, our original plan was not to move the drill, but we moved the drill for five or six days in the middle because the task changed. However, we will still guarantee to complete the state plan for April eight days in advance.
    On behalf of our team, I would like to express to the worker brothers across the country that we will humbly learn from the drilling worker brothers across the country, and we also hope that the drilling worker brothers across the country can improve work efficiency on the basis of ensuring quality, and strive to develop the underground treasures of the motherland.

    做好探测祖国地下宝藏的工作
    阜新煤矿马文志钻探小组副机长
    出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会辽西省代表  刘万禄
    我是马文志钻探小组的副机长。我们小组从前年红五月以来，接受苏联专家的指示，学习了苏联快速钻进和使用黄泥浆的先进经验，把钻机快轮的回转数从每分钟二百三十三转提高到二百七十四转；中轮从一百四十转提高到一百六十四转；慢轮从八十转提高到九十八转。黄泥浆保全了井壁，防止了事故。先后在钻进效率上，创造了几次全国最高纪录。
    一九五二年一年中，我们小组一共钻进了两千五百多公尺，完成了国家订正计划的百分之一百一十八还多。
    我们的钻进效率虽然很快，在数量上虽然超额完成了国家的任务，但是，我们的质量很差，煤芯采取率和国家的要求相差很远。就拿去年来说，我们小组的煤芯采取率最高不过百分之六十七点八，最低只到百分之十，全年平均是百分之二十九。
    地质钻探，主要就是为了探测地下的矿藏量。煤矿工人们尊敬地称呼我们是“煤矿工业的眼睛”，或者“采矿的尖兵”。意思是说，我们是他们的开路先锋，我们的任务要提供可靠的地下资料，让他们去开采。可是我们过去做得却很不够，只注意快，不注意质量，不明确打出眼来究竟是为了什么。领导上下来检查工作时，也是只问钻进速度，不问采取的岩芯、煤芯。我们当机长的人，也只是检查每小班进了多少，从来不问质量怎样。这样的工作态度是非常错误的。从最近召开的全国煤矿钻探会议的材料上看，全国煤矿钻探工作，普遍有这个偏向。这种现象决不能让它继续下去。
    为了迎接红五月，为了迎接中国工会第七次全国代表大会，我们小组已制定了各种制度，改善了操作方法，保证以后岩芯采取率在百分之八十五以上，煤芯采取率在百分之七十以上。四月份我们原定计划不搬钻，中途因为任务改变了，搬了五六天钻。但是，我们仍要保证提前八天完成四月份的国家计划。
    我代表我们小组向全国工人兄弟表示，我们一定虚心向全国钻探工人兄弟学习，我们也希望全国钻探工人兄弟，能在保证质量的基础上，提高工作效率，为开发祖国地下的宝藏而奋斗。
