    Happy Childhood
    Jin Feng

    In the warm embrace of the motherland, the lives of Beijing's children are happy. When a small life has not yet been born, the motherland cares for them like a loving mother; when a small life is born, the motherland nurtures them in the same way, hoping that this new generation will grow up quickly and healthily to create a happier future for the new China.

    In the beautiful and clean resting room of the Beijing Maternal and Child Health Hospital, golden sunlight pours in through the large glass windows, illuminating the light blue walls and the wall-mounted picture of a white and plump baby waving and smiling. Fresh flowers bloom in the vase. The doctor walks in cheerfully, picks up the model on the table, and more than a dozen expectant mothers surround the table to listen to the explanation of painless childbirth.

    The snow-white delivery room sends out the first cry of a baby. Another small life is born safely and without pain. The mother breathes a sigh of relief, looks at the slogan on the wall, "Your little baby is an infinite force in building the motherland," and smiles as she thinks of her first painless delivery.

    In the newborn baby room, forty or fifty small white beds are lined up side by side, and the babies are all sleeping sweetly. The nurse weighed the newborn baby and said with a smile, "This baby is so heavy, it weighs nine pounds!"

    Three days later, the little life has been injected with BCG vaccine to prevent the invasion of tuberculosis germs, and vaccinated against smallpox. Five days later, the baby was discharged from the hospital with his mother. Entrusted by the motherland, this Maternal and Child Health Hospital and other Maternal and Child Health Centers distributed in various districts of the city are regularly responsible for the health of infants and children in the city, conducting regular health check-ups, conducting home visits and health education, giving vaccinations, and taking various health measures to ensure that children grow up healthily.

    In factories, in urban areas, and in rural suburbs, how many nurseries and childcare stations have been established to relieve mothers of their burdens and enable them to work, study, and produce with peace of mind!

    This is the famous Beihai Nursery. With a burst of bird-like noise, more than twenty children aged four or five, wearing sky-blue sailor suits, walk down from the楼(lóu- story building), each carrying a small stool, to attend music class. With the melodious sound of the piano, they beat the rhythm with hand drums and small wooden blocks, singing in unison the song "Don't look at me as I am young..." In the dormitory, milky white, light green, and sky-blue small beds are neatly arranged, with more than two hundred beds. The bell rings, it is time for lunch. The little duty students put on white aprons and distribute the tableware and napkins. The children sit down in an orderly manner and begin their hearty lunch, eating so sweetly; the nannies smile happily as they watch.

    This is the nursery of the North China Military Region Clothing Factory. In a cool, clean room away from the noise of the workshop, mothers are happily breastfeeding their children. The little ones greedily suckle their mother's rich milk. The mother, Zhang Jinghui, is a young female worker. She smiles and raises him high, weighs him, and he is one pound heavier than half a month ago. She is so happy that she looks at the child again and again; when it is time to go to work, she puts down the child and walks happily to the workshop. The nannies take care of them carefully. When the mothers get off work, the lively children go home with their mothers one by one.

    From the day they become sensible, the children of Beijing are familiar with the words "Volunteer Army Uncles," just as they are familiar with "Mom," "Teacher," and "Nanny," and their concern and love for the Volunteer Army almost surpasses everything. The children of Beihai Nursery draw a large truck loaded with flowers and tell the nannies that they want to send it to the Volunteer Army Uncles. The children diligently feed the chicks with their small hands. When the chickens grow up and can lay eggs, the children carefully pick them up one by one, not eating any, but keeping them to send to the Volunteer Army Uncles. When eating dumplings during the New Year, they will ask their mothers: Can the Volunteer Army Uncles also eat dumplings? When it snows heavily and they hear the wind whistling against the window panes, they suddenly become worried: Don't let the Volunteer Army Uncles get cold. When their mothers rub lotion on their hands in the morning after washing their faces, they think that the Volunteer Army Uncles' hands must also be chapped, and they tell their mothers to buy a box of oil with their candy money and send it to the uncles.

    In order to cultivate children's desire for knowledge, labor habits, and interest in science, the motherland has created good conditions for this new generation. The nannies in the nurseries take the children to understand nature and society. In addition to the classroom knowledge of the school, there are various extracurricular activity groups to help consolidate and expand the children's knowledge fields. The "Children's Home" in Beijing is a model of this kind of activity. The biology group here collects various plant specimens, observes changes in nature in the suburbs, and makes small microscopes out of cardboard; cultivates seeds and plants flowers and fruits according to Michurin's theory. The physics group makes batteries, electric bells, and warship models, and experiments with voltage and resistance. The chemistry group uses light bulbs as flasks and ink bottles as alcohol lamps to make iodine and test paper, and makes models of molecules and atoms. In the geology room, the motherland's rich mineral resources: beautiful bat stones, fish fossils, gold, iron, copper, tin ore, mica, crystal, white jade, coral, and agate are all shining brightly for future geologists. When their small eyes are so full of emotion as they stare at them, and their small hands carefully stroke these minerals, the rocks of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years seem to be calling them to grow up quickly, advance to science, and serve the motherland. The art group paints, prints, dyes, sculpts, and does paper cutting, often sending their creations to the Volunteer Army Uncles. Cheerful songs float in the music room, and the dance group is practicing dancing. They are all rushing to rehearse programs to celebrate their own festival.

    The children of Beijing are not satisfied with their happy present, they are also looking forward to a happier tomorrow. They are the future engineers, who will build the most beautiful houses; they are the future pilots, who will fly airplanes to transport peaceful passengers; they are the future steelmaking experts, who will ensure that the motherland's construction will not feel the lack of steel; they are the future scientists who will transform nature, who will make the motherland grow full of green trees and flowers; they are the future painters, who will depict the happy and prosperous motherland. Now, let's listen to them sing about their aspirations:

    "I want to be a labor hero, driving the motherland-made machinery,
    Install a hydroelectric generator on the Yangtze River, let the thousands of horsepower
    The current rushes out the greatest power, transported from the hydropower station to the railway,
    Mines, factories, and collective farms, let all our villages shine brightly! I want to drive a tractor, harvesting the collective farm's rich grain, load it into cars and transport it to the country's granary; we must transform the motherland's nature to be more prosperous and beautiful, so that Hainan Island's sweet lychees and bananas grow in Manchuria, the northernmost part of the motherland!"

    幸福的童年
    金凤
    在祖国的温暖怀抱里，北京的孩子们的生活是幸福的。当小生命还没有出世的时候，祖国像慈母一样关怀着他们；当小生命出世以后，祖国同样像慈母一样抚育着他们，希望这新的一代迅速地健壮地成长起来，创造新中国更幸福的未来。
    在北京妇幼保健院美丽、清洁的休息室内，金色的阳光从大玻璃窗倾泻进来，照着淡青色的墙壁，照着墙上又白又胖的婴孩招手微笑的挂图。瓶中的鲜花盛开。大夫愉快地走了进来，拿起桌上的模型，十多个待产的母亲围着桌子倾听无痛分娩法的讲解。
    洁白的产房，送出第一声婴孩的啼哭。一个小生命又平安地没有痛苦地降生下来。母亲轻松地透了口气，望着墙上“你的小宝宝是建设祖国无限的力量”的标语，想着她第一次无痛的分娩，她微笑了。
    新生的婴儿室里，四五十张白色的小床并列着，婴孩都在甜睡。护士把刚生的婴孩过了磅，笑着说：“这个娃娃好重，有九磅！”
    三天以后，小生命已经注射了防止肺痨病菌侵袭的卡介苗，又点了防止天花传染的牛痘。五天以后这个婴儿就随着母亲出了院。受着祖国的委托，这个妇幼保健院以及分布在各个市区的其他妇幼保健所，在经常负责着全市婴孩和儿童的健康，定期进行健康检查，进行家庭访问和卫生教育，注射预防针，采取各种保健措施，让儿童们都会健壮地成长起来。
    在工厂，在市区，在郊区的农村，为了解除妈妈们的拖累，使她们安心的工作、学习和生产，成立了多少托儿所，托儿站啊！
    这里是著名的北海托儿所。随着一阵小鸟似的喧闹声，二十多个四五岁的穿着天蓝色小海军装的孩子从楼上走下来，一个个端着小凳子，他们是下来上音乐课的。随着钢琴的悠扬的音调，他们用手鼓、用小木块敲打着节拍，齐声唱起了：“不要看我年纪小……”的歌曲，寝室里乳色的、淡绿色的、天青色的小床整整齐齐排列着，这里有二百多张床位。摇铃了，到了吃饭的时间，小值日生系上白围裙，分发着食具和餐巾。孩子们有秩序地围坐下来，开始了他们丰盛的午餐，吃得多香甜啊；阿姨们看着愉快地笑了。
    这里是华北军区被服厂的育儿室。在远离车间喧闹的地方，几间阴凉、清洁的屋子里，母亲们在快活地给孩子喂乳。小家伙贪婪地吮吸着母亲丰富的乳汁。母亲叫张景惠，是一个青年女工，她笑着把他高举起来，抱过去秤一秤，比上半个月又重了一磅，她高兴得把孩子看了又看；上班的时间到了，她放下孩子，愉快地走向车间。保育员细心地照顾着他们，当母亲们下班的时候，活泼泼的孩子一个个跟着母亲回家去了。
    北京的儿童，从他们懂事的那一天起，就熟悉了“志愿军叔叔”这几个字，好像他们熟悉“妈妈”、“老师”、“阿姨”一样，而他们对志愿军的关心和爱戴又几乎超过了一切。北海托儿所的娃娃，画一个大卡车上面载着鲜花，告诉阿姨说，要送给志愿军叔叔。孩子们用他们的小手，殷勤地喂养了小鸡，鸡长大起来，能生蛋了，孩子们又一个个小心地拣起来，一个也不吃，要留着送给志愿军叔叔。过年吃饺子的时候，他们会问妈妈：志愿军叔叔也能吃到饺子吗？下大雪，听到风刮得玻璃窗呼呼地响，他们会忽然发愁起来：志愿军叔叔可不要冻着哪。早上洗脸妈妈给孩子手上擦润肤油，他们想到志愿军叔叔的手一定也会起裂纹，告诉妈妈要把自己的糖果钱给叔叔买一盒油寄去。
    为了培养儿童求知的欲望、劳动的习惯和对科学的兴趣，祖国更给这新的一代创造了良好的条件。托儿所的阿姨们带着孩子认识自然，认识社会。除了学校的课堂知识以外，有各种课外活动小组，来帮助巩固和扩大孩子们的知识领域。北京市的“少年之家”是这方面活动的典范。这里的生物小组采集各种植物标本，到郊外观察自然的变化，用硬纸做成小小显微镜；根据米丘林的学说培植种籽，栽种花果。物理小组动手做出电池、电铃和军舰模型，试验电压和电阻。化学小组用电灯泡做烧瓶，墨水瓶当酒精灯，制出碘酒和试纸，做出分子和原子的模型。在地质室里，祖国丰富的矿藏：美丽的蝙蝠石、鱼化石，金、铁、铜、锡矿，云母、水晶、白玉、珊瑚和玛瑙都在向未来的地质学家闪耀着光芒。当他们小小的眼睛这样充满着感情地凝视着、小手这样用心地抚摸着这些矿石时，几万年、几十万年的岩石都像在召唤着他们快一点成长起来，向科学进军，为祖国服务。美术小组绘画、印染、雕塑、剪纸，时常把他们的创作寄给志愿军叔叔。音乐室里飘扬着愉快的歌声，舞蹈组正在练习舞蹈。他们都在赶排庆祝自己节日的节目。
    北京的孩子们，并不满足于幸福的今天，他们还在瞻望着更幸福的明天。他们是未来的工程师，要建筑出最美丽的房屋；是未来的飞机师，要驾着飞机运送和平的旅客；是未来的炼钢能手，要使祖国的建设不会感到钢铁的缺乏；是未来改造自然的科学家，要使祖国到处长满绿树和鲜花；是未来的画家，要把幸福繁荣的祖国来描画。现在，且听他们歌唱自己的志愿吧：
    “我愿做一个劳动英雄，驾着祖国制造的工作
    机，在长江上装好水电发动机，让千万匹马力的水
    流，冲击出最大的电力，从水电站输送到铁路、
    矿山、工厂和集体农庄，让我们的所有乡村，大放光明！我愿驾着一架拖拉机，收获集体农庄丰富的粮食，装满汽车运到国家的粮库；我们要把祖国的大自然，改造得更繁荣美丽，让海南岛甜蜜的荔枝、香蕉，生长在祖国最北的满洲里！”
