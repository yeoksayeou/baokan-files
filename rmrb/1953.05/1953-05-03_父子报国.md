    Father and Son Serve the Country
  　Gao Hou
    On March 8th, the day after the people of An County, Sichuan Province, held a memorial service for the heroes Chen Kaimao and Cai Chaoxing, both martyrs in the style of Huang Jiguang, they decided to take a separate photo of Chen Hongde, the father of martyr Chen Kaimao, who was a model for supporting the front lines. Here is how it was done: a large apricot-yellow brocade banner was hung behind Chen Hongde, with the words "Glorious Family" made of blue velvet. This was a precious gift jointly presented to Chen Hongde by the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, the Sichuan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Sichuan Branch of the China Resist America, Aid Korea Association. He was also holding a "Model in Supporting the Front" banner, which read: "Overcome all difficulties and gloriously complete the grain transportation task."

    It turns out that Chen Hongde and Chen Kaimao, father and son, had a touching story of encouraging each other to love and protect their country in the past.

    In the winter of 1950, when the movement to resist America and aid Korea swept the country, the people of Anchang Township, An County, Sichuan Province, responded enthusiastically upon hearing the news. Young farmers from nearby villages asked to join the Volunteer Army, and Chen Kaimao also signed up. At that time, he was only nineteen years old.

    On the day of his departure, Chen Hongde personally sent his son to the county. Along the way, he looked at his child, who was taller than himself, and thought about many things: this child had suffered and been scolded with adults since he was born, and now that he had raised him, and things had turned around, unexpectedly the American imperialists wanted to harm us again... Thinking, he couldn't help but sigh. Chen Kaimao thought his father was worried and quickly said, "Dad, as the saying goes, 'country, country, only with a country can there be a home,' and we have turned over..." Chen Hongde smiled and said, "If you have ambition, do a good job! I will definitely encourage production to support you."

    In the autumn of 1951, when Chen Kaimao's hometown, Shuimu Village, was donating to support the Volunteer Army, Chen Hongde received his son's first letter. The letter read: "Dear parents: After I arrived in Korea, my comrades and the Korean people treated me like family. I can only repay them by killing more enemies. I hope you will work hard in the rear and strive to be a glorious model worker!" Chen Hongde told this news to his old wife, and Chen's mother couldn't stop smiling. Chen Hongde thought, "This child wants me to strive to be a model worker. I am old, I am afraid I can't do it." Suddenly, he instructed Chen's mother: "Quickly weigh ten catties of rice, I will go to the village early tomorrow morning to donate and support our child in fighting American imperialism." Under Chen Hongde's influence, a wave of donations was set off in the whole village.

    From then on, Chen Kaimao constantly wrote letters to his family, reporting his combat stories and encouraging his father to move forward. Chen Hongde also constantly wrote back to his son, reporting on the situation in his hometown and making his own guarantees. Once, Chen Kaimao wrote in a letter to his father: "Dad, you don't know, I have made much more progress than before, I can master new weapons, and I have also joined the Youth League. I am preparing to welcome new combat missions!" Chen Hongde thought as he read: The new society is really a generation better than the last! I have to pay attention myself, so as not to be too far behind my child!

    Around June of last year, the sound of artillery fighting bandits in a certain place in Sichuan Province began. Chen Hongde thought: Now is the time for me to contribute. He immediately signed up to transport grain to support the bandit suppression troops. People stared at the old man with surprised eyes. He didn't say a word, carrying more than a hundred catties of grain, braving the scorching sun, crossing mountains and ridges, and following the grain transportation team towards the destination. One night, they camped in the wilderness, and it was raining heavily, and the grain was getting wet in the rain. Chen Hongde did not hesitate to cover the grain with his quilt. Everyone was also moved by him and quickly covered the grain.

    After a seven-day and seven-night journey of thousands of miles, they arrived at their destination. But the situation changed again: the remaining bandits entrenched in the area had been eliminated, and the troops had set off to another place to suppress bandits. The captain called on everyone to "transport the grain to our own troops!"

    The two places were still four or five hundred miles apart, there were no inhabitants within a hundred miles, no water to drink within tens of miles, and they had to pass through many forests. The captain and many comrades advised Chen Hongde not to go. However, Chen Hongde thought of the icy and snowy weather in Korea, thought of the bandit suppression soldiers in front, and thought of his son's letter. He was very excited and felt that he could not go back like this anyway. So he ran to the captain and asked, "Don't look at me being old, I still have plenty of energy." The captain still didn't agree. Early the next morning, he packed everything up and ran to ask the captain again. The captain and comrades still advised him not to go. Chen Hongde was a little angry. He picked up a load of a hundred catties and ran a few steps, and said very seriously, "Why don't you let me go, let's compare!" The captain saw that it was not good to force him to stay, and then agreed. Under the inspiration of this old man, the spirit of the entire team of more than seven hundred people became more full, and they rushed all the way to the destination without a single person falling behind.

    In this way, Chen Hongde was rated as a "First-Class Model in Supporting the Front," and the People's Government also awarded him sixty catties of oil, two carrying baskets, and a hoe. He immediately wrote a letter to tell his son the news. Soon, his son wrote back, and in addition to congratulating his father, he also wrote: "I have been rated as a 'Model League Member' and am preparing to strive to join the Party, strive to add merit to merit, and be a combat hero!"

    That was indeed the case. In a battle on the Korean battlefield on January 5th of this year, Chen Kaimao and Cai Chaoxing, in order to cover the troops' charge, like the hero Huang Jiguang, used their bodies to block the enemy's machine gun fire, and exchanged their youthful lives for the victory of the battle. The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers awarded the two martyrs the glorious title of "Second-Class Hero," and Chen Kaimao was posthumously recognized as a formal member of the Communist Party of China by a committee of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The sacrifice of his son, of course, brought great grief to Chen Hongde and his family, but it further stimulated their enthusiasm for working hard to produce and support the Korean front. At a symposium, Chen Hongde's family all expressed this determination. The martyr's younger brother, Chen Kaiguo, said: "I want to challenge Huang Jiguang's younger brother, Huang Jishu, and strive to be a production model." Chen's mother said: "I want to learn from the spirit of Huang's mother and educate my children even better." Chen Hongde also said: "I will work harder to produce, produce more grain, support the front lines, and avenge Mao'er!"

    父子报国
  　高侯
    三月八日，四川省安县各界人民给黄继光式的英雄陈开茂、蔡朝兴两位烈士开过追悼大会的第二天早晨，人们又决定给陈开茂烈士的父亲、支援前线的模范陈洪德单独拍张照片。事情就这样办了：一面杏黄色的大锦旗挂在陈洪德的身后，旗上有用青绒制成的“光荣之家”四个字，这是四川省人民政府、中国人民解放军四川军区、四川省抗美援朝分会共同赠给陈洪德的珍贵礼品。他的怀里还抱着一面“支前模范”的锦旗，上面写着：“克服一切困难，光荣完成运粮任务”。
    原来，陈洪德、陈开茂父子俩，在过去有着一段互相鼓励的爱国保家的动人故事。
    一九五○年冬天，全国掀起了抗美援朝运动，四川省安县安昌乡的人们听到这个消息后，都热烈响应。附近村上的青年农民都要求参加志愿军，陈开茂也报了名。那时，他才十九岁。
    临走那天，陈洪德亲自送儿子到县里去。一路上，他看着身材比自己还高的娃儿，想起了许多心事：这孩子一生下来就跟大人一块受苦挨骂，现在把他拉扯大了，又翻了身，看着日子有了过头了，想不到美帝国主义又想来祸害我们……。想着，不由得叹了一口气。陈开茂以为父亲在发愁，忙说：“爸爸，常言说国家国家，有国才有家，我们又翻了身……”陈洪德微笑了，说：“有志向，就好好干吧！我一定鼓劲生产来支援你。”
    一九五一年秋天，当陈开茂家乡水木村正闹着捐献支援志愿军的时候，陈洪德第一次收到了儿子的来信。信上写着：“亲爱的父母亲：我到了朝鲜以后，战友和朝鲜人民待我都像亲人一样，我只有多杀几个敌人回答他们。希望你在后方努力生产，争取当一个光荣的劳动模范！”陈洪德把这个消息告诉了老伴，陈妈妈也是合不住嘴地笑。陈洪德想：“这娃儿叫我争取当模范，我年纪大了，恐怕不行了。”忽然，他叮咛陈妈妈：“赶快秤好十斤米，我明天打早到村上去捐献，支援咱娃儿打美帝国主义。”在陈洪德的影响下，全村掀起了捐献的热潮。
    从此，陈开茂就不断给家中写信，报告自己的战斗故事，鼓励父亲前进。陈洪德也不断给儿子回信，报告家乡情况，还提出自己的保证。一次，陈开茂在给父亲的信上写着：“爸爸，你不知道，我比过去又进步得多了，能够掌握新的武器，还加入了青年团，正准备迎接新的战斗任务呢！”陈洪德一边读着，一边想：新社会真是一代赛过一代啊！我自己可得注点意，不要和娃儿差得太远了！
    去年六月间，四川省某地剿匪的炮声打响了。陈洪德想：这一下自己出力的机会可到了，马上报了名运粮支援剿匪部队。人们都以惊异的眼光注视着这位老人。他却一声不响，担着一百多斤粮食，顶着烈火般的太阳，翻山越岭，跟着运粮的队伍向目的地进发。一夜，他们露宿在旷野里，天还下着大雨，粮食在雨里淋着。陈洪德毫不犹豫地把自己的被子盖在粮食上。大家也都被他感动了，很快把粮食遮起来。
    经过七天七夜的千里路程，他们到达了目的地。可是情况又发生了变化：盘踞在该地区的残匪已被肃清，部队又出发到另一个地方去剿匪了。队长号召大伙“把粮食运给自己的部队！”
    两地相距还有四、五百里的路程，百里之内没有人烟，几十里地以内找不到水喝，还要穿过很多的森林。队长和许多同志都婉言相劝，要陈洪德不要再去。可是，陈洪德想起了朝鲜的冰天雪地，想起了前面的剿匪战士，想起了儿子的来信，心里很激动，觉得他无论如何不能就此回去。于是跑到队长面前请求说：“你别看我年纪大了，劲头可还足着哩。”队长还是没有答应他。第二天一早，他把一切收拾停当，又跑去请求队长，队长和同志们还是劝他别去。陈洪德有点生气了，他挑起一百来斤重的担子飞跑了几步，很严肃地说：“为什么不让我去，比比看！”队长眼看不好强留，才答应了。全队七百多人在这位老人的感召下，精神更加饱满起来，一直赶到目的地，没有一个人掉队。
    就这样，陈洪德被评为“甲等支前模范”，人民政府还奖给他六十斤油?，两挑箩篼和一把锄头。他马上把这个消息写信告诉了自己的儿子。不久，儿子又回信了，信上除了给父亲贺功外，还写着：“我已被评为‘模范团员’，正准备争取入党，争取功上加功，当一个战斗英雄呢！”
    事实正是这样。在今年一月五日朝鲜战场的一次战斗中，陈开茂和蔡朝兴两同志为了掩护部队冲锋，像英雄黄继光一样，用自己的身体堵住了敌人发射着的机枪口，用自己青春的生命换取了战斗的胜利。中国人民志愿军政治部，授予两烈士以“二级英雄”的光荣称号，陈开茂烈士并被中国共产党志愿军某部委员会追认为正式党员。
    儿子的牺牲当然给陈洪德和他的家庭带来了很大的悲痛，但也进一步激发了他们努力生产支援朝鲜前线的热情。在一次座谈会上，陈洪德一家大小都表示了这种决心。烈士的弟弟陈开国说：“我要和黄继光烈士的弟弟黄继恕挑战，争取当一个生产模范。”陈妈妈说：“我要学习黄妈妈的精神，把儿女教养得更好。”陈洪德也说：“我要更加努力生产，多打粮食，支援前线，为茂儿报仇！”
