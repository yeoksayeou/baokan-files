    Two Different Methods of Fertilizer Supply
    Ren Guangjian
    Some cooperative cadres in Huailai and Wu'an counties in Hebei Province, and Yuxiang, Jiexian, and Yongji counties in Shanxi Province, adopted the wrong method in supplying fertilizer: they went to the countryside with tasks, held large meetings in the villages, and asked village cadres and Party and Youth League members to take the lead in purchasing, and then asked the masses to report their purchase figures. When these cadres failed to complete the sales quotas, they convened farmers' meetings again and again. Some farmers couldn't stand it anymore and said, "Why don't you just divide it up? We can't afford to attend these meetings anymore!" Some cadres openly said at mass meetings, "This is fertilizer allocated by the higher authorities; you have to buy it whether you want to or not." After the meeting, it was distributed proportionally according to the amount of land. This mandatory and commandist working method aroused dissatisfaction among the farmers and seriously hindered the smooth progress of fertilizer supply work, especially production.
    The cooperative cadres in Jixian County, Hebei Province, and Changzi County, Shanxi Province, did not hold mass meetings or group meetings in promoting fertilizer sales, nor did they ask cadres or Party and Youth League members to take the lead. Instead, they first understood the needs of each farmer and mutual aid team, and combined it with the work of purchasing local products to appeal to farmers to purchase voluntarily according to their specific situations. Before supplying fertilizer, the cadres of the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jixian County first went to the villages to understand the situation, helped farmers and mutual aid teams check their production plans and calculate the amount of fertilizer needed, and patiently explained to the farmers the great significance of applying fertilizer to complete the production plan, so that the farmers voluntarily purchased it. One cadre of the cooperative sold as much as 7,000 jin of bean cake in one day.
    There are also two different methods for promoting chemical fertilizers in various places: one is that the higher-level cooperatives do not conduct investigations and research, but rigidly assign tasks layer by layer, and the grassroots cooperatives hold mass meetings to force apportionment, which arouses great resentment among the farmers. The other is to conduct serious investigation and research, and pay attention to strengthening technical guidance, using "typical demonstrations" and "real people and real events" of obtaining high yields through the application of chemical fertilizers to educate the farmers, so the farmers are happy to accept it.
    These facts fully illustrate that if we do not oppose the bureaucratic working methods but adopt practical and specific working methods, and if we do not abandon the commandist working methods but adopt persuasive education working methods, we will become detached from the masses. This will not only fail to complete the task of supplying fertilizer well, but will inevitably hinder production. Therefore, the cooperative cadres must pay attention to studying the needs of the masses and improving their working methods in the current work of supplying fertilizer, so as not to spoil good things.

    两种不同的供肥方法
    任广建
    河北省怀来、武安和山西省虞乡、解县、永济等县部分合作社的干部，在供应肥料工作中，采取了带任务下乡，到村开大会，让村干部和党、团员带头购买，然后叫群众自报购买数字的错误方法。这些干部在完不成推销数字的时候，就一次再一次地召集农民开会。有的农民实在熬不住了，说：“干脆分了吧，咱开不起会啦！”有的干部公开在群众大会上讲：“这是上级分配的肥料，想买也得买，不想买也得买。”会后就按亩摊派下去。这种强迫命令的工作方法引起农民的不满意，严重地妨碍了供肥工作的顺利进行，尤其是妨碍了生产。
    河北蓟县、山西长子等县合作社的干部在推销肥料工作中，没有开群众大会和片会，也没有叫干部或党、团员带头，而是先了解各户农民和互助组的需要，结合收购土产工作，分别对象号召农民自愿购买。蓟县二区供销社的干部在供肥以前，先到村了解情况，帮农民和互助组检查生产计划和计算需肥数量，向农民耐心说明施用肥料对完成生产计划的重大意义，使农民自愿购买。该社一个干部最多时一天就卖出七千斤豆饼。
    各地推销化学肥料，也有两种不同的方法：一种是上级社不调查研究，就一层层硬性地分配任务，基层社就开群众大会强迫摊派，引起农民极大反感。一种是认真调查研究，并注意加强技术指导，采用“典型示范”和通过施用化学肥料获得丰产的“真人真事”，向农民进行教育，因而农民很乐于接受。
    这些事实充分说明：不反对官僚主义的工作方法而采取实际、具体的工作方法，不抛弃命令主义的工作方法而采取说服教育的工作方法，就会脱离群众。这样不仅不能很好地完成供应肥料任务，而且必然会妨碍生产。因此，合作社的干部在当前供应肥料的工作中，必须注意研究群众的需要，并改进自己的工作方法，以免把好事办坏了。
