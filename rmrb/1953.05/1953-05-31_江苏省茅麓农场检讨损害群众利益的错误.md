Jiangsu Province Maolu Farm Conducts Self-Criticism for Errors Harming the Interests of the Masses

Letter from Maolu Farm, Jiangsu Province: We sincerely accept the criticism made by Comrade Luo Binwen in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on April 29th regarding our farm's serious actions that harm the interests of the masses, and we offer the following self-criticism:

Maolu Farm was originally owned by bureaucratic capitalists before liberation and relied solely on land rentals for its upkeep. After we took over the farm in March 1950, we gradually made adjustments. In the summer of 1952, the farm drafted a five-year plan to develop crops such as tea and bamboo. In addition to reclaiming 485 mu of wasteland, it was also necessary to recover 240 mu of land rented to the masses. At that time, we obtained the consent of the Maolu District People's Government and notified the farmers to prepare to return the land to the farm after the autumn harvest. However, for such a major issue concerning the interests of the masses, we relied solely on administrative orders to resolve it, while turning a deaf ear to the actual living problems of the local farmers and the opinions they raised. Until this spring, in order to rush to sow tea seeds, we neither went deep among the masses to understand the situation nor contacted the village cadres. We adopted a rude attitude and sowed tea seeds on the mountains where the masses had already planted wheat, in the fields where the masses were growing pine seedlings and peach trees, and even in the vegetable gardens of the masses; even the mountains that were declared not to be taken back last year were planted with bamboo. Our egregious actions aroused great resentment among the masses and created an extremely bad influence.

The problem developed to such a serious extent, fortunately with the active help of the higher-level Party and the local government, we were able to face up to this intolerable mistake. The leading cadres of our farm conducted a painful review in the farm in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, and educated all employees on safeguarding the interests of the masses and opposing coercion and commandism; in addition, special personnel were sent to cooperate with village cadres to convene mass meetings and conduct public self-criticism.

We have also decided to handle this issue as follows:

One, the damaged wheat fields, pine seedlings, and vegetables will be compensated at a fair price. Two, a unified solution for the land recovery issue has been discussed with the masses: all land rented out before liberation will be recovered by the farm; land reclaimed by the masses after liberation will in principle be limited to four years of planting. If the farm must recover land that has been planted for less than four years, the farm will subsidize the cost of reclamation; if the farm can postpone the use of the land, it will be recovered after the autumn harvest this year. Three, in order to prevent the opening of mountains and filling of ponds, we have decided to adopt the method of horizontal strip planting for tea, plant windbreaks along mountain roads and at the foot of the mountains, and dig ditches at the foot of the mountains. Four, the 130 peach trees will still be allowed for the masses to plant for ten years, and the tea seeds that have been intercropped will be completely removed after the seedlings emerge, and the land will be returned to the farm after the expiration of the period.

At present, the masses have basically no objections to the above handling methods. However, the egregious political impact caused by our erroneous behavior is significant. In the future, we will definitely make up our minds, earnestly change our style of work, closely connect with the surrounding masses, and strive to run the farm well.

### 江苏省茅麓农场检讨损害群众利益的错误

    江苏省茅麓农场检讨损害群众利益的错误
    江苏省茅麓农场来信：四月二十九日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了罗斌文同志对我场严重损害群众利益行为的批评，我们诚恳接受，并作如下检讨：
    茅麓农场在解放前原属官僚资本家所有，当时专靠土地出租维持。一九五○年三月我们接管农场后，即逐步进行调整。一九五二年夏，本场拟订五年计划，准备发展茶叶、毛竹等作物，除开生荒四百八十五亩外，还须收回群众租地二百四十亩。当时我们取得茅麓区人民政府同意，通知农民准备在秋收后把土地交还农场。但我们对这样一个有关群众利益的重大问题，只单纯依靠行政命令来解决，而对当地农民群众的实际生活问题和他们提出的意见却置若罔闻。直到今年春天，我们为着赶紧播下茶籽，事先既没有深入群众去了解情况，又没有与乡村干部取得联系，就采取粗暴态度，在群众已种上麦子的山上、在群众种着松苗、桃树的田里、甚至在群众菜蔬园里都播上了茶籽；连去年宣布不收的山也种上毛竹。我们这样恶劣的行动激起群众的极大愤恨，造成极坏的影响。
    问题发展到如此严重程度，幸亏上级党和当地政府积极帮助，使我们正视了这种不可容忍的错误。我场领导干部在场内结合反官僚主义斗争沉痛地作了检查，并对全体员工进行了维护群众利益、反对强迫命令的教育；另外又派专人配合乡村干部召开群众会议，公开进行检讨。
    我们并决定对这个问题作如下处理：
    一，损坏的麦田、松树苗和蔬菜等折价赔偿。二，收回土地问题已与群众商量了统一办法：解放前出租土地由农场全部收回；解放后由群众开垦的土地原则上以种四年为限，不足四年而目前农场必须收回者由农场贴补开垦成本费；如目前农场尚可缓用的土地则待今年秋收后收回。三，为了防止开山塞塘，我们决定采用横行条播的方法种茶，山路旁和山脚下都栽植防风林，并在山下开沟。四，一百三十株桃树仍让给群众种十年，已间作好的茶籽待出苗后全部移走，期满后土地再交还农场。
    目前群众对以上处理办法基本上没有意见。但是我们的错误行为所造成的恶劣政治影响很大。今后我们一定痛下决心，切实转变作风，密切联系周围群众，努力办好农场。
