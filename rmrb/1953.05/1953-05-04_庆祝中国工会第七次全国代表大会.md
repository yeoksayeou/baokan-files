Through this congress, in summarizing the glorious experience of past struggles and putting forward new and great historical tasks, it will surely further promote the labor enthusiasm and creative spirit of the working class throughout the country, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, more brilliantly and correctly unite the people of the whole country, to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend world peace, to ensure the completion of the national construction plan, and to strive for the victorious realization of national industrialization!
