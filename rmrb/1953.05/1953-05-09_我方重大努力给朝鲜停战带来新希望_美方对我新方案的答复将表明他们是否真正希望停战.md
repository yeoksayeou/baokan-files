Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. Our special correspondent reports that when the plenary session of the armistice negotiation delegation reconvenes in Panmunjom tomorrow, the US representatives will have to show the world whether they genuinely want an armistice in Korea. Their response to the new proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese representatives to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue will show whether they sincerely hope for an armistice or whether they will put forward new excuses to delay a complete agreement.

Observers here point out that the significant efforts and concessions made by the Korean and Chinese sides have brought new hope for signing an armistice agreement in Panmunjom. Both the six-point or eight-point proposals of the Korean and Chinese sides can enable the immediate realization of the Korean armistice. Unless the US representatives raise new obstacles to hinder the agreement, the main differences between the two sides in handling the issue of prisoners of war not directly repatriated have been eliminated by General Nam Il's proposal.

The Korean and Chinese representatives have put forward their new eight-point proposal to eliminate differences between the two sides, although they still believe that their previously proposed suggestion of sending non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to neutral countries is a better suggestion, because it frees the prisoners of war from the influence of the detaining party and enables them to express their willingness to return home. This new proposal clearly shows that the Korean and Chinese sides have made every effort to seek a solution conducive to the realization of the Korean armistice.

The five neutral nations—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, and India, which constitute the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission—will be responsible for guarding the prisoners of war in the current prisoner of war camps in Korea. Agreement has already been reached on the first four neutral nations by both sides.

The practical problem of how to free prisoners of war from the military control and custody of the detaining party has been solved by providing the neutral nations with armed forces to manage the large number of prisoners of war and carry out their responsibilities.

Since the US representatives have stubbornly refused to allow the prisoners of war's home countries a longer period to explain to the prisoners of war so that they can return home quickly, the term has been reduced from six months to four months.

The issue raised by the US representatives regarding the final disposition of prisoners of war still under the custody of the neutral nations after the deadline has also been resolved. The higher-level political conference convened in accordance with the armistice agreement will decide on the method of their final disposition.

The eyes of the world are focused on Panmunjom to see if the US representatives will also adopt a compromising attitude like the Korean and Chinese representatives to achieve the Korean armistice without further delay.

    我方重大努力给朝鲜停战带来新希望
    美方对我新方案的答复将表明他们是否真正希望停战
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者报道，停战谈判代表团大会明天在板门店复会的时候，美方代表将不得不向全世界表明他们是否真正希望在朝鲜停战。他们对朝中代表所提的解决整个战俘问题的新方案的答复，将表明他们究竟是真心希望停战，还是要提出新的借口来拖延完全的协议。
    此间观察家指出：朝中方面所作的重大努力和让步，已给在板门店签订停战协定带来了新希望。无论是朝中方面的六点方案或八点方案，都能使朝鲜停战立即实现。除非美方代表提出新的障碍来阻挠协议，否则，双方在处理不直接遣返的战俘的问题上的主要分歧，已被南日将军的建议消除了。
    朝中代表已提出他们的新的八点方案来消除双方之间的分歧，虽然他们仍然认为他们先前所提的把不直接遣返的战俘送往中立国的建议是更好的建议，因为它使战俘摆脱拘留的一方的影响，使他们能够表示他们回家的意愿。这个新方案清楚地表明，朝中方面已尽一切努力，以寻求有利于实现朝鲜停战的解决办法。
    五个中立国——构成中立国遣返委员会的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士、瑞典和印度——将在朝鲜目前拘留战俘的地方进行看管战俘的工作。前四个中立国双方已经取得协议。
    如何使战俘摆脱拘留一方的军事管制和看管，这一实际问题已经得到解决，办法是供给中立国以武装部队来管理大批战俘和执行他们的责任。
    由于美方代表一直固执地拒绝让战俘所属国家有一个较长的期限来对战俘进行解释，以使他们能很快地回家，因此，期限从六个月减少到四个月。
    美方代表所提出的关于在期限过后仍然在中立国看管下的战俘的最后处理的问题，也已经解决了。按照停战协定召开的高一级的政治会议，将决定对他们最后处理的方法。
    全世界的目光都集中在板门店，看美方代表是否也和朝中代表一样采取妥协的态度，以实现朝鲜停战而不再拖延。
