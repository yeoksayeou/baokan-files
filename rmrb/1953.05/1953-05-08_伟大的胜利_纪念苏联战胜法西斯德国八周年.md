    Great Victory
    —Commemorating the Eighth Anniversary of the Soviet Victory over Fascist Germany
    Lieutenant General M. Kozlov of the Soviet Army
    Eight years ago, the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War ended with a complete victory over Hitler's Germany. This was a world-historically significant victory for the Soviet people and their powerful armed forces over the most powerful imperialist army. This was a great victory for the Soviet people over the dark forces of imperialist reaction, which threatened the world with fascist enslavement.
    The Great Patriotic War was a severe test for the Soviet people and their armed forces. It was a moment of life and death for the Soviet state, a key to whether the Soviet people would gain freedom or suffer enslavement.
    German militarism, nurtured by international imperialism after the First World War, attacked the Soviet Union with a huge, heavily armed army that already had two years of modern warfare experience. The Fascist elements, who hated humanity, were determined to eliminate the Soviet state and turn the Soviet people into slaves of the German aristocrats.
    In those difficult days, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin led the armed struggle of the Soviet people.
    Responding to Comrade Stalin's call to "Use all the strength of the people to annihilate the enemy!", the Soviet working people rallied even more closely around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, around their beloved leader and teacher Stalin. The Soviet rear and front became one.
    Stalin said in his historic radio address on July 3, 1941: "This national patriotic war against the Fascist oppressors aims not only to eliminate the danger facing our country, but also to assist the people of European countries groaning under the yoke of German Fascism." This task was gloriously accomplished by the heroic Soviet army.
    The Soviet armed forces, led by the brilliant Marshal Stalin, withstood the onslaught of the barbaric Fascist beasts, exhausted them in defensive battles, stopped their offensive, and then crushed Hitler's war machine.
    The Soviet army, relying on a strong rear, won the victory over Fascist Germany in arduous battles. The Soviet army annihilated Hitler's troops outside Moscow, shattering the "blitzkrieg" plan boasted by the Fascist heads.
    The Battle of Stalingrad, which ended with the encirclement, annihilation, and capture of 330,000 German troops, marked the beginning of a fundamental turning point in World War II. Comrade Stalin said: Stalingrad was the starting point for the decline of the German Fascist army. In the Battle of Kursk, after exhausting the enemy, the Soviet troops turned from defense to offense, and then launched a powerful summer offensive by the entire Soviet army. After suffering ten Stalin's devastating blows, in 1944 the German Fascist invaders were driven out of the Soviet territory, and the war was pushed into enemy territory. In the decisive battle of 1945, the Soviet army killed the Fascist beast in its lair and raised the banner of victory over Berlin.
    The glorious victory of the Soviet army, nurtured by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and led by Comrade Stalin, has become a model of the heroism, fortitude, and indestructible strength shown by the Soviet people in their struggle against foreign aggressors, and will forever remain in the memory of the working people of the world. This victory has become a glorious page in the combat history of the Soviet people and an outstanding example in the history of military art.
    The Lenin-Stalin Party was the organizing and leading force of the Soviet people during the Great Patriotic War. The Party mobilized the material and spiritual forces of the people to crush the enemy, tirelessly propagandized the just and freedom-seeking purpose of the Patriotic War to the Soviet people, and strengthened their confidence in victory. The Soviet people trusted their Party, responded to its call, and contributed everything to win victory.
    The enemies of peace and democracy estimated that the Soviet rear and the Soviet system were unstable. The war proved that the enemy's estimate was unfounded. The Soviet social state system successfully withstood all the tests of the war and proved that it has abundant vitality. The moral and political unity of the Soviet people, the unbreakable friendship between the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people's ardent patriotic enthusiasm were powerful forces in the struggle against the enemy.
    The Soviet Union's historic victory in World War II changed the entire international situation: the capitalist position was greatly weakened, and the forces of socialism and democracy gained unlimited growth. If previously only one powerful Soviet socialist country stood in opposition to capitalism, now an incomparably powerful socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, stands in opposition to capitalism.
    With the establishment of the people's democratic countries, which Stalin called the "new shock force" of the world revolutionary workers' movement. the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism have been infinitely strengthened. Now one-third of mankind has escaped the oppression of imperialism and has been liberated from the chains of imperialist exploitation. After the end of the war, the strength of the socialist system is becoming stronger and stronger.
    Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, and other people's democratic countries, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, have restored the wounds of war in the shortest possible time, are developing industry, agriculture, and culture at an unprecedented speed, improving the material well-being of the working people, and smoothly laying the foundation for building socialism.
    The achievements of the socialist camp countries show the world the consolidation of the socialist foundation and the absolute superiority of the new social system over the capitalist system.
    The victorious conclusion of the Great Patriotic War has also further enhanced the international prestige and influence of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's policy is in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries in the world.
    As early as during the war against Fascist Germany, Comrade Stalin, in his speech commemorating the 26th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution on November 6, 1943, formulated the Soviet Union's foreign policy in the post-war period. While talking about other important tasks, Comrade Stalin proposed to establish long-term economic, political, and cultural cooperation among the people of all countries on the basis of mutual trust and mutual assistance.
    In order to successfully complete these tasks, the Soviet Union has been fighting unyieldingly. Not long ago, Comrade Malenkov, on behalf of the Soviet government, announced: "The Soviet Union has consistently pursued and continues to pursue a policy of maintaining and consolidating peace, a policy of opposing the preparation and launching of new wars, and a policy of international cooperation and developing relations with all countries, which is based on the Leninist-Stalinist principle that two different systems, capitalism and socialism, can coexist peacefully and compete peacefully for a long time."
    The Soviet Union proves its love for peace not only in words but also in deeds. The Soviet Union reduced its armed forces after the war, and in March 1951, it passed the Law on the Protection of Peace, declaring that propaganda for war in its own country is the most malicious crime against humanity.
    On the international stage, the Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward proposals aimed at consolidating peace. The Soviet government has consistently supported all measures aimed at stopping the Korean War. The reply from Soviet government leader Stalin to Indian Prime Minister Nehru in July 1950 was the beginning of this. The broadcast speech by the Soviet representative to the Security Council in New York in June 1951 became the basis for starting the Korean armistice negotiations.
    The Soviet government, as stated by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on April 1, 1953, fully agrees with the proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and is ready to do its utmost to realize them. This proposal creates conditions for a fair solution to the Korean question. It offers the possibility of ending the war, signing an armistice agreement, and thus moving from war to peace.
    The Leninist-Stalinist principle of international friendship and cooperation is clearly manifested in the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance signed between the countries of the socialist camp clearly reflect the will of the liberated people to consolidate peace and international friendship and cooperation.
    The Soviet people are completely faithful to the cause of world peace and friendship and cooperation among the people of all countries. After winning a world-historically significant victory over Hitler's Germany, which perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union, the Soviet people are now fighting to realize the great communist construction plan. The Soviet working people are strengthening the strength of their motherland—the fortress of world peace—and regard their peaceful construction work as a contribution to the cause of world peace.

    伟大的胜利
    ——纪念苏联战胜法西斯德国八周年
    苏军中将  穆·科兹洛夫
    八年前，苏联的伟大卫国战争以对希特勒德国的完全胜利而结束了。这是苏联人民及其雄强的武装力量对于最强大的帝国主义军队的具有世界历史意义的胜利。这是苏联人民对于以法西斯奴役威胁全世界的帝国主义反动黑暗势力的伟大胜利。
    伟大的卫国战争是对苏联人民及其武装力量的一个严重的考验。这是苏维埃国家生死存亡的关头，这是苏联人民获得自由或遭受奴役的关键。
    在第一次世界大战以后为国际帝国主义所豢养的德国军国主义，以巨大的、已具有两年现代化战争经验的、武装到牙齿的军队，向苏联进攻。仇恨人类的法西斯主义分子一心要想消灭苏维埃国家，想把苏联人民变为德国王公贵族们的奴隶。
    在这些严重的日子里，苏联共产党和斯大林同志领导了苏联人民的武装斗争。
    苏联劳动人民响应斯大林同志“把人民的一切力量都用去歼灭敌人！”的召号，更加紧密地团结在苏联共产党的周围，团结在自己敬爱的领袖和导师斯大林的周围。苏联的后方和前方结成了一个整体。
    斯大林在一九四一年七月三日具有历史意义的广播演说中说：“这个反法西斯压迫者的全民卫国战争，其目的不仅是要消灭临到我国面前的危险，而且还要援助那些呻吟于德国法西斯蒂枷锁下的欧洲各国人民。”这个任务被英勇的苏联军队光荣地完成了。
    天才的斯大林大元帅所领导的苏联武装力量抵挡住了野蛮的法西斯禽兽的进攻，在防御性的战役中把它们弄得精疲力竭，停止它们的进攻，然后粉碎了希特勒的战争机器。
    苏联军队由于依靠着坚强的后方，得以在顽强的战斗中赢得了对法西斯德国的胜利。苏军在莫斯科外围歼灭希特勒军队，粉碎了法西斯头子们所吹嘘的“闪电战”计划。
    以包围、歼灭和俘掳三十三万德军而结束的斯大林格勒战役，成为第二次世界大战的根本转变的开始。斯大林同志说：斯大林格勒是德国法西斯军队没落的起点。在库尔斯克战役中，苏联部队在消耗了敌人并且将他们弄得精疲力尽之后，便转守为攻，然后又转入了整个苏军的强有力的夏季攻势。遭受了十次斯大林毁灭性的打击以后，一九四四年德国法西斯侵略者便被逐出了苏联国境，战事被推到敌人国境以内。在一九四五年的具有决定性的战役中，苏联军队在法西斯野兽的洞穴里，打死了法西斯野兽，在柏林城上树起了胜利的旗帜。
    苏联共产党所教养和斯大林同志所领导的苏联军队底光辉胜利，已成为苏联人民与外国侵略者的斗争中所表现的英勇、刚毅和不可摧毁的力量的典型，而永远留在全世界劳动人民的记忆里。这胜利已成为苏联人民战斗史上光辉的一页，已成为整个军事艺术史上杰出的范例。
    列宁—斯大林党是苏联人民在伟大卫国战争期间的组织和领导力量。党动员人民的物质力量和精神力量来粉碎敌人，不倦地向苏联人民宣传卫国战争底正义的、争取自由的目的，加强了他们对于胜利的信心。苏联人民信任自己的党，响应党的号召，贡献出自己的一切来争取胜利。
    和平、民主的敌人估计苏联后方和苏维埃制度是不稳固的。战争证明了敌人的这种估计毫无根据。苏维埃社会国家制度成功地经受住了战争的一切考验，证明了自己具有充沛的生命力量。苏联人民在道德上和政治上的团结一致，苏联各族人民间牢不可破的友谊以及苏联人民烈火般的爱国主义热情，是与敌人斗争的强大力量。
    苏联在第二次世界大战中取得的历史性胜利，改变了整个国际形势：资本主义阵地大大削弱了，社会主义和民主的力量获得了无限的增长。如果说从前和资本主义对立的只是一个强大的苏维埃社会主义国家，那么现在和资本主义对立的却是一个无比强大的、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营了。
    随着被斯大林称为世界革命工人运动的“新突击队”的人民民主国家的成立。和平、民主、社会主义的力量无限地增强了。现在全人类已有三分之一的人口摆脱了帝国主义的压迫，从帝国主义剥削的锁链中解放了出来。战争结束以后，社会主义体系的力量是越来越强大了。
    匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、保加利亚以及其他人民民主国家，在苏联的兄弟般的帮助下，在最短时期内恢复了战争的创伤，以历史上从未有过的速度发展着工业、农业和文化事业，改善着劳动人民的物质福利，顺利地为建成社会主义奠立基础。
    社会主义阵营国家获得的成就，向全世界说明了社会主义基础的巩固，说明了新的社会制度对于资本主义制度的绝对优越性。
    伟大卫国战争的胜利结束还进一步提高了苏联的国际威望和影响，苏联的政策是符合于全世界各国人民的切身利益的。
    远在对法西斯德国作战时期，斯大林同志在一九四三年十一月六日纪念伟大十月社会主义革命二十六周年的演说中，就拟订了苏联在战后时期的对外政策。斯大林同志在谈到其他重要任务的同时，提出要在互相信任和互相帮助的基础上建立各国人民在经济上、政治上和文化上的长期合作。
    为了成功地完成这些任务，苏联一直在不屈不挠地斗争着。不久以前，马林科夫同志代表苏联政府宣布：“苏联过去和现在始终一贯地奉行维护与巩固和平的政策，奉行反对准备和发动新战争的政策，奉行国际合作以及和所有国家发展事务关系的政策，这个政策是以列宁、斯大林关于资本主义和社会主义两种不同制度有可能长期共处与和平竞赛的原则为依据的。”
    苏联不但用言辞而且用行动来证明自己爱好和平。苏联在战后缩减了自己的武装力量，一九五一年三月，通过保卫和平法案，宣布在自己国内宣传战争是反人类的最恶毒的罪行。
    在国际舞台上，苏联一再提出目的在于巩固和平的建议。苏联政府一贯支持一切旨在停止朝鲜战争的措施。苏联政府领袖斯大林在一九五○年七月给印度总理尼赫鲁的复电，是这方面的开端。一九五一年六月苏联驻安全理事会的代表在纽约的广播演说成为开始进行朝鲜停战谈判的基础。
    苏联政府，正如苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在一九五三年四月一日所声明的，完全赞同中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的建议，并准备竭力促其实现。这个建议为朝鲜问题的公平解决创造了条件。它给停止战争、签订停战协定从而由战争走向和平提供了可能。
    列宁、斯大林国际友好合作的原则，明显地表现在苏联与各人民民主国家的相互关系中。社会主义阵营各国家间签订的友好合作互助的条约，明显地反映出获得自由的各国人民巩固和平与国际间友好合作的意志。
    苏联人民完全忠实于世界和平与各国人民间友好合作的事业。苏联人民在对于背信弃义地向苏联进攻的希特勒德国赢得了具有世界历史意义的胜利以后，现在又正在为实现伟大的共产主义建设计划而奋斗。苏联劳动人民正在加强自己的祖国——世界和平的堡垒——的力量，把自己和平建设性的劳动当成对于世界和平事业的贡献。
