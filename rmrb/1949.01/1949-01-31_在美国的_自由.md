　　In the past two years, the dream of American monopoly capital to conquer the world and turn the 20th century into the American century has been running into snags everywhere. Many Americans themselves admit that their country has become a demon in the eyes of people around the world, practicing monopoly control and stifling people's freedom. The American imperialists, at the end of their rope, know that their defeat has already begun. In order to unite their partisans around the world and deceive those who are unaware, they use the word "freedom" as a slogan every day, saying that they are supporting corrupt and tyrannical reactionary regimes like Chiang Kai-shek everywhere in order to defend freedom. But in fact, history has long transformed this last bastion of capitalism into an object for the people to fight for freedom. This country has become an enemy of the people's freedom in order to defend autocracy, enslavement, and plunder. For American imperialists to now say they are defenders of freedom is like Chiang Kai-shek saying he is a revolutionary. Chiang Kai-shek is being revolutionized and is about to be revolutionized away. Similarly, American monopoly capital, this blind monster, is bound to smash itself on the rocks of people's freedom.

　　These are principles that people with revolutionary consciousness are already familiar with, so familiar that they are like truisms. However, precisely because the United States is the last bastion of capitalism, it can still anesthetize and deceive some people with the wealth it has plundered. Especially in China, for fifty years, many intellectuals have looked up to Britain and the United States, especially the United States, in terms of culture and thought. They always thought that even if the United States had some other flaws, such as a lack of economic democracy, it at least had political democracy, political freedom, and freedom of individual development, etc. In China, there are still quite a few people who believe in this deception of the American bourgeoisie and who see political democracy as separable from economic democracy.

　　Does the United States really have democracy and freedom? On this question, some monopoly capitalists in the United States are more honest than many eulogists of freedom. They once simply advocated abolishing the word "democracy" from their political rhetoric, believing that democracy was a term used by the Communist Party. During the war, their military personnel once advocated not using the Declaration of Independence, which they themselves issued during the Revolutionary War, in colonial propaganda, believing that the document was "too revolutionary." Some of them also believed that their people enjoyed "too much" freedom, so that the people lacked discipline. It is precisely because American freedom is this kind of freedom that in the United States, except in their own homes, very few people dare to openly advocate that the United States should move towards socialism. I was in the United States for four years, and in newspapers and periodicals, I found that almost only the American Communist Party advocated this. In addition, in general publications, I only saw one article that openly raised the question of moving towards socialism. The term "socialism" is almost universally recognized as contraband in the United States, while the word "profit" is like the benevolence, righteousness, and morality in Confucius's mouth, is the creed of the country.

　　The black issue is one of the best topics to show the hypocrisy of American political freedom. Blacks in the United States are a nation with a population of thirteen to fourteen million. The American constitution has never recognized the status of this nation, and has never proposed to guarantee the freedom and welfare of blacks as a nation. The constitution only recognizes the freedom of black citizens. For blacks, among American whites, apart from genuine progressives, the commonly called more kind people only advocate dissolving or "assimilating" them into whites, so that they can enjoy the same rights as whites in the general legal provisions. Except for genuine progressives, almost no one recognizes that blacks should have the right to self-determination, as a nation should manage their own lives and develop their own culture. This situation, of course, makes widespread discrimination and oppression of blacks by whites possible, and of course makes the various laws in the South that deprive blacks of their rights possible. Whites can use lynching against blacks and arbitrarily kill them. And any black person who violates a white person's hair, there is a fear of being beaten, jailed, and killed.

　　Some Americans say: The political unfreedom of blacks is indeed a stain on American politics, but this is ultimately not enough to encompass all of American politics. Among white Americans, there is indeed widespread political freedom. Indeed, some Americans have great political freedom, and these people are the big capitalists in the United States and their spokespersons. During the war, there was a group of Americans in the United States who acted as spies and propagandists for Hitler. At the time, the government arrested them. But in the end, nothing was done. When the war ended, some people clamored that those spies should be acquitted. In 1947, these criminals were released from prison in the name of political freedom and became free men. For example, the laws of the American government oppose violence and oppose the promotion of violence, but last year it was reported that the leader of a fascist group, supported by DuPont and other arms dealers, published pamphlets and propaganda documents, calling on citizens to arm themselves to oppose New Dealists and communists. Has this gentleman been sanctioned by the law? No. Because he has political freedom. The year before last, the United States came up with an anti-labor bill, which does not allow trade unions to spend money on political groups or parties to promote political activities. However, it is a matter of course political freedom for the monopoly magnates to take out hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in their personal names to support the daily activities and election campaigns of their political parties. These are just a few things that can be picked up at will. It is difficult to say all the facts about how the big capitalists in the United States control the political freedom of their own people and even foreign people in this short article.

　　With the political freedom of this kind of people, there is no political freedom for other kinds of people, this is certain. The big capitalists in the United States enjoy such great political freedom, and the political freedom of the American working people and even some small and medium-sized bourgeoisie cannot but be deprived and restricted. For example, Wallace, this can also be regarded as an "individual," and an "individual" belonging to the bourgeoisie, he should have his "individual" "political freedom," right? But Wallace's books are not allowed in libraries. Even books about Wallace are regarded as banned books. Wallace can't find broadcast time, and even if he does, it's in the middle of the night, when people are dancing or sleeping. Many progressive film writers, directors, and actors are not allowed to engage in film work according to their own beliefs and perceptions, otherwise they will be arrested and tried. The world-renowned progressive novelist Fast was arrested and tried by Congress for his work in rescuing refugees from the Spanish Republic, and later had to go to jail. Radio broadcasters lost their jobs because their broadcast content was too progressive. Ordinary writers rarely find places to publish their writings if they do not scold the Soviet Union in their articles. Members of the American Communist Party and the Progressive Party often need to keep their party membership and actions secret in order to gain a foothold in society. Last autumn, the twelve leaders of the American Communist Party were arrested for no reason. Although they were later released on bail, the case was not concluded, and now a "trial" is being held again. Even government officials are often likely to be followed by secret agents, visited, threatened, and deprived of their positions for no reason, without notifying them of the reasons.

　　With political oppression comes economic oppression. These people who truly fight for the freedom of the people, once they are taken care of by the government, become people without recourse in society. He lost his job, and it is difficult to find a job again. He not only loses the freedom to work and act, but even the freedom to eat bread is in danger.

　　The so-called American political democracy, which the American rulers are proud of, is their two-party system of representative system and universal suffrage. In fact, the bourgeois representative system is built on the control of the bourgeoisie. First of all, in that society where money constitutes the bridge between all activities and all relations between people, without money, even kinship can be turned into nothing. Without money, it is of course impossible, at least not easy, to produce such a broad collective behavior—elections. The organization and propaganda of election activities rely on the money of the bourgeoisie. This almost makes it impossible for the victorious outcome of the election to be attributed to the true representatives of the broad masses of the people. Secondly, everyone knows that the two major parties in the United States are parties representing the bourgeoisie. The working class party—the Communist Party—has been restricted by legislation. It still cannot become a completely open and legal party. Even the Progressive Party, although basically a bourgeois party, cannot be established nationwide because of this restriction. There are thirteen to fourteen million black people, but they do not have a party to represent their rights and interests. Therefore, the essence of this representative system is exactly in line with the old Chinese saying, it is a system of raping public opinion, selling dog meat under the guise of a sheep's head. Its role is for the benefit of the bourgeoisie, for seeking compromises within its own class, and for deceiving the general public.

　　In terms of specific electoral legislation, there are many restrictions. First of all, when registering to vote, not only must you be able to write your own name (many people in the southern United States are illiterate, and the illiteracy rate in some individual provinces is as high as 70%), but sometimes you also have to test your knowledge of the constitution and foreign languages, and in the southern states, you also have to pay a poll tax. This excludes many eligible voters. The main people who are excluded are of course black people. Secondly, the president is nominally elected by universal suffrage, but in reality, he is elected by the Electoral College (531 in total) controlled by local forces in each state. Sometimes, even if the president gets a majority of the popular vote, he may not be able to become president. Third, in order to prevent the emergence and growth of new parties representing the people, the ruling class stipulates that each new party must have a certain number of people in each state sign a request for registration, otherwise it will not be able to run for election in that state; if the progressive forces in that state are larger, the number of people required to register for the new party in that state is stipulated to be particularly high. Even if the number of requesters meets the quota, the right to determine whether the registration can be successful is in the hands of the state assembly and judicial organs representing the local forces of the state. In this way, it makes it difficult for a new party to be established. These practices are the plans used by the ruling class to protect its own control. Under such an electoral system, the freedom of election of the American people is deprived of very little left.

　　Politics is the concentrated expression of economics, which is indeed an unbreakable truth. The United States, which is dominated by monopoly capital, cannot have political democracy if it does not have economic democracy. In the United States, we do not see true political freedom for the people, nor do we see freedom of individual development for the people, but only see its opposite. In the United States, we see that capitalist society is trying to make everything in people's lives move towards standardization and branding. People's material lives are under the command of advertising companies, and their spiritual lives are regulated by radio, movies, and newspapers. The lack of liberation of the personality of the American people and the vagueness of the meaning of life are one of their greatest pains today. The rampant symptoms of schizophrenia make American psychoanalysts as numerous as doctors who treat colds and coughs, and have almost become a national disease in the United States. The freedom to have a nervous breakdown can also be regarded as a characteristic of American freedom.

　　Of course, all of the above does not mean that the American people are a servile nation. There is no nation in the world that does not love freedom. The American people established the country through revolution by resisting enslavement. The American people have a tradition of fighting for freedom. Although on many fundamental issues, the American bourgeoisie is still using its huge layers of political and economic machinery to try to deceive and paralyze the people and create political ignorance among them; however, on specific issues that the people directly contact, such as prices, wages, labor policies, war and peace, etc., the American bourgeoisie cannot hide their fundamental differences with the broad masses of the American people. Therefore, the deception and paralysis of the American bourgeoisie cannot but be torn apart layer by layer by the demands of the people, and the development of the world people's movement will accelerate this tearing process. The American imperialists clamor about their so-called freedom at home and abroad, but in fact, they are just using pink paper to resist the flames of the people's demands.

### 在美国的“自由”

专栏：

　　在美国的“自由”
    前大公报驻美记者  杨刚
    近两年来，美国垄断资本所做的征服世界、把二十世纪变成美国世纪的大梦，正在到处碰钉子。不少的美国人自己承认他们的国家已经在全世界人民眼中变成一个实行垄断控制、扼杀人民自由的恶魔。穷途末路的美国帝国主义者，深知自己的败仗已经开始，为了团结他们在全世界的党羽，欺骗不明真相的人们，他们天天用“自由”两个字作号召，说他们是为了保卫自由，才到处支持腐烂暴虐如蒋介石之流的反动政权。但是事实上历史早已把这个资本主义的最后堡垒转变成了被人民争取自由的对象。这个国家为了保卫专断、奴役和掠夺，早已和人民的自由做了敌人。美国帝国主义者现在说自己是自由的保卫者，正如蒋介石说他自己是革命者一样。蒋介石正在被革命，而且已经快被革掉了。同样，美国垄断资本这个瞎了眼睛的怪物，也一定是会把它自己撞碎在人民自由的岩石上的。
    这些本来是有革命觉悟的人民所已经熟悉的道理，熟悉到和老生常谈一样了。可是，正由于美国是资本主义的最后堡垒，凭着它所掠夺得来的财富，它还可以麻醉欺骗一部分人。尤其是在我们中国，五十年来，在文化思想上，很多的知识分子是仰望着英美尤其是美国的。他们总以为美国即使有什么旁的不好，例如没有经济民主，但至少是有政治民主，政治自由，个性发展的自由等等。在中国，把美国资产阶级的这种欺骗信以为真的人，把政治民主看做可以与经济民主相分离的人，至今还不是很少数。
    美国真的有民主，有自由吗？在这问题上，美国有一部分垄断资本家倒是比许多自由主义的歌颂者老实些。他们曾经干脆主张在他们的政治言论中取消民主两个字，认为民主是共产党所用的字眼。在大战中，他们的军事人员就曾经主张在殖民地宣传品中，不要采用他们自己在独立战争时代所发表的独立宣言，认为那个文件“太革命”了。他们中间也曾有人认为他们的人民所享受的自由“太多”了，以致使人民没有纪律。正是因为美国的自由是这样一种自由，所以在美国除了在自己的房子里以外，只有极少的人敢公然主张美国应该走向社会主义。我在美国四年之久，在报刊中发现几乎只有美国共产党是这样主张的。此外，在一般刊物里，只看过一篇文章曾经公开提出走向社会主义这个问题。社会主义这个名词在美国几乎是公认的违禁品，而利润两个字，却象孔夫子嘴里的仁义道德一样，是国家的信条。
    黑人问题是最足以表明美国政治自由的虚伪性的题目之一。黑人在美国是一个数至一千三四百万人口的民族。美国的宪法上从来没有承认这民族的地位，对于黑人作为一个民族的自由和福利从来没有提出来加以保障。宪法上只承认了黑人公民的自由。对于黑人，美国白人中，除了真正的进步分子之外，普通所谓比较善良的人们，也只是主张把他们溶解或“同化”在白人中，以便他们能在一般法律的条文上享有和白人同等的权利。除了真正的进步分子之外，几乎没有人承认黑人应该有自决权，作为民族应该管理他们自己的生活，发展他们自己的文化。这种情形，当然就使的白人对黑人广泛的歧视欺压成为可能，当然就使得南方种种剥夺黑人权利的法律成为可能。白人可以对于黑人采用私刑，任意屠杀。而任何黑人假如侵犯了白人一根毫毛，就有挨打坐牢送命之忧。
    有些美国人说：黑人政治不自由诚然是美国政治的污点，但是这究竟不足以概括美国政治的全部。在美国白人中间，究竟是有着普遍的政治自由。真的，有些美国人确是有很大的政治自由，这些人就是美国的大资本家及其代言人。大战中间，在美国有一群美国人替希特勒当间谍作宣传。当时政府把他们抓起来了。但始终也没办。等到战争结束，有些人就大嚷起来了，说那些间谍应该无罪开释。一九四七年，这些罪犯就在政治自由的名义下面出了监牢，做了自由人。又如美国政府的法律反对暴行和反对宣传暴行，但是去年报载有一个法西斯团体的领袖受了杜邦等军火大王的支撑，出版小册子和宣传文件，号召市民武装起来反对新政主义者和共产党，这位先生受了法律的制裁没有呢？没有。因为他有政治自由。前年美国弄出一个反劳工法案，这东西不许工会对政治团体或党派出钱，以推动政治活动。但是垄断大王们以个人名义几十万几百万元的拿出来支持他们的政党日常活动与竞选活动，却是天经地义的政治自由。这不过是随手拈来的几件事。关于美国大资本家们怎样控制本国人民以至外国人民的政治自由的种种事实，在这篇短文里是很难说完的。
    有了这种人的政治自由，就没有别种人的政治自由，这是一定的。美国大资本家享受了这样大的政治自由，美国的劳动人民甚至一部分中小资产阶级的政治自由，就不能不受剥夺和限制了。比如华莱士，这也算是一个“个人”，而且是一个属于资产阶级的“个人”，应该有他“个人”的“政治自由”吧。可是华莱士的书不容于图书馆。甚至于讲华莱士的书也被视为禁书。华莱士找不到广播时间，即便找到，也在半夜，在人们跳舞或睡觉的时候。许多进步的电影作家、导演和演员，不许依自己的信念和观感来从事影业工作，否则要被抓去受审。举世闻名的进步小说作家法斯特，因为从事救济西班牙共和国难民的工作而被抓到国会受审，后来还要坐牢。无线电广播员因为广播内容太进步而丢了饭碗。普通的作家若在文章里不骂苏联，就少有地方发表写作。美国共产党和进步党的党员们经常需要把他们的党籍和行动秘密起来，才能在社会上站得住。去年秋间，无缘无故把美共十二个领袖抓起来。后来虽然取保释放，但案子并未完结，现在又举行“审判”了。甚而至于政府官吏，时常有可能被密探跟着，被他们访问，威胁，无故地被夺去职务，也不把理由通知他们。
    随着政治的压迫就是经济的压迫。这些真正为人民自由而斗争的人们，一经政府收拾了之后，在社会上就成了无告之民。他丢了职业，也难再找职业。他不但是失掉了工作行动的自由，就是连啃面包的自由也发生危险了。
    美国统治者所据以自豪的所谓美国政治民主的特色，是他们的两党分立的代议制度和普选制度。实际上，资产阶级的代议制度是建筑在资产阶级的控制上面的。首先，在那个把金钱构成人与人之间一切活动一切关系的桥梁的社会里，没有钱连亲族关系都可以化为乌有，没有钱，当然不可能，至少是不容易产生这样一种广大的集体行为——选举。选举活动的组织和宣传要靠资产阶级的钱。这几乎使选举的胜利结果不可能归于广大人民的真正代表人。其次，大家都知道美国两个大党都是代表资产阶级的政党。工人阶级的政党——共产党，因为受了立法的限制。至今还不能成为一个完全公开合法的政党。甚至于进步党，虽然基本上是一个资产阶级的政党，也因为这种限制，而不能在全国范围内成立。黑人有一千三四百万，却没有代表自己权益的政党。因此，这种代议制度的实质，就恰恰符合了中国的老话，是强奸民意，挂羊头卖狗肉制度。它的作用，是为了资产阶级的利益，为了谋得本阶级内的妥协，为了欺骗一般老百姓的。
    在具体的选举立法方面，还有许多限制。首先选民登记时，非但要会写自己的名字（在美国南部许多人不识字，有的个别省份文盲率竟达百分之七十），有时还要考宪法知识和外国语言，在南方各州还要出人头税。这就把及龄选民排斥了许多。主要被排斥的当然是黑人。其次，总统名义上是普选，实际上是被各州地方势力所控制了的选举院（共五百三十一人）选出来的。有时总统即使得到普选的多数票，还不一定能当总统。其三，统治阶级为了防止代表人民的新党派产生和成长，规定每一新党必须在每一州有若干人签名请求登记，否则就不能在该州竞选；那一州的进步力量较大，该州新党登记请求人的数目就规定得特别高。即使请求人数够额，登记是否能够成功，其权又操在代表该州地方势力的州议会和司法机关。这样一来，就使新党的成立难乎其难。这些做法就是统治阶级用来保障自己控制的打算。在这样一个选举制度下面，美国人民选举的自由就被剥夺得所剩无几了。
    政治是经济的集中表现，究竟是一个颠扑不破的真理。垄断资本所支配的美国，既然没有经济的民主，就不能有政治的民主。在美国，现在看不到真正的人民的政治自由，也看不到人民的个性发展的自由，而只是看到它的反面。在美国，我们看见资本主义社会正在力图使人们的生活中的一切都向着标准化、商标化走。人们的物质生活是在广告公司的指挥之下，他们的精神生活是无线电、电影、报刊所规律化了的。美国人民的个性之不得解放，生活意义之茫然，是他们今天最大的苦痛之一。泛滥的精神分裂病状，使美国的精神分析医生象治伤风咳嗽的医生一样多，几乎成了美国的国病。生神经病的自由，也可算是美国自由的特色。
    当然，以上这一切决不是说美国人民是一个奴性民族。世界上没有一种人民不爱好自由，美国人民是从反抗奴役而革命而建国的，美国人民是有争自由的传统的。虽然在许多根本的问题上，美国资产阶级还在运用它庞大的层层的政治和经济机器，力图欺骗和麻痹人民，制造他们在政治上的愚昧；但是在人民所直接接触的具体问题上，比如在物价、工资、劳工政策、战争与和平等等问题上，美国资产阶级却无法隐瞒他们与美国广大人民的根本分歧。因此，美国资产阶级的欺骗和麻痹，不能不被人民的要求层层撕破，而世界人民运动的发展更会加速这个撕破的过程。美国帝国主义者在国内外喧嚷他们的所谓自由，事实上只是用粉红纸张来抵挡人民要求的火焰。　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北二十二日电】
