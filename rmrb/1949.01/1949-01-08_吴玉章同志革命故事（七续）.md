　　Fighting the Trotskyists

　　Today's Chinese Trotskyists have degenerated to the point where they cannot openly show their faces, but they are still using their betrayal money to run this magazine and that magazine, saying that the land reform carried out by the Chinese Communist Party is not "thorough" enough! Saying that the coalition government is "handing over" power to the bourgeoisie! And so on, as if they are the most "thorough." However, when all progressive publications and even liberal publications are banned by the reactionaries, these Trotskyist magazines are printed with "Registration Certificate of the Ministry of Interior Affairs Jingjing Hu Zi No. ×××," and they can circulate without hindrance, which reveals their "identity" at once. No matter what they say, they are just like the Kuomintang's open secret service newspapers, doing their best to fulfill their anti-communist tasks.

　　Even when the Trotskyists had not degenerated to this point, their opinions on the Chinese revolution were actually beneficial to the Chinese counter-revolutionaries. For example, Chen Duxiu, originally advocated that the Chinese democratic revolution should be led by the Chinese bourgeoisie, therefore he surrendered to the landlords and the big bourgeoisie; but later he became a follower of Trotsky, believing that there was no feudal force in China and that a socialist revolution should be carried out, therefore he should not cooperate with the Chinese bourgeoisie. Isn't this extremely strange? It is precisely because such an extremely strange "theory" can never work that they can only throw themselves into the arms of the fascist group.

　　When Comrade Wu Yuzhang arrived in the Soviet Union, he encountered the activities of the Trotskyists at that time. They distributed their propaganda to the students. A Chinese printing worker was dragged into their small organization by the Trotskyists. When the Party wanted to investigate him, he came to Comrade Wu Yuzhang and said that he was being attacked by others and that he had only read the Trotskyist leaflets given to him by others. Comrade Wu Yuzhang did not know his actual situation, but he advised him with principle to be sincere and loyal to the Party and to tell everything. Because at that time, if he had confessed everything frankly, there would have been nothing wrong. But this person lied to Comrade Wu Yuzhang, saying that he had nothing to hide. Two days later, people proved that he had not confessed all the facts, and when he came to Comrade Wu Yuzhang again, Comrade Wu Yuzhang ignored him. As a result, he was expelled from the Party.

　　When teaching in Vladivostok, the Far East Publishing Bureau asked Comrade Wu Yuzhang to compile a Chinese textbook. At that time, because he was busy, he excerpted some of Stalin's speeches and several articles from a Chinese textbook compiled by Comrade Shen Zemin in Moscow, plus a few articles he wrote himself, and compiled them into a book. At that time, there were quite a few Trotskyites in the Far East, and they fought fiercely with Comrade Wu Yuzhang and the others. As soon as the book was published, they accused Comrade Wu Yuzhang to the Far East Regional Party Committee, saying that he had committed many opportunist errors. Comrade Wu Yuzhang was greatly surprised when he heard this, and immediately carefully checked the points they pointed out. He found a mistake in his own article. He simply said that the Soviet Union had eliminated the rich peasants, but he did not say that the rich peasants were eliminated on the basis of agricultural collectivization. Several articles selected by Comrade Shen Zemin also had some mistakes in the issues of the Chinese revolution, the state, and morality. Because Comrade Wu Yuzhang believed that Comrade Shen Zemin had good theoretical cultivation, he thought that the articles he selected would not have any mistakes, so he did not carefully study their contents when compiling them. So Comrade Wu Yuzhang spent half a month studying the theories of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin on these issues. After he deeply understood these issues, he wrote a very long statement to the Party branch, in which he wrote all these errors, even those that the Trotskyists did not see but that he himself thought were wrong, and reviewed the source of the errors, explaining that he was willing to take full responsibility for the errors in his own articles or the articles he selected from others, and vowed to fight against these erroneous views in order to maintain the purity of the theory of the Bolshevik Party. Finally, he asked the Party to give him a severe punishment as a lesson for Party members who do not study deeply and are careless and negligent in their work.

　　Then the Party held a branch meeting to discuss this issue. Comrade Wu Yuzhang sincerely reported the content of the statement orally again. Many comrades said that he was loyal to the Party, frankly admitted his mistakes, and had a deep understanding of the mistakes. His correction of the mistakes was also sincere and resolute, and the punishment should be lenient. Some said that he should be given a slight warning, and some said that an admonition would be enough. Finally, Comrade Lin Boqu said: "I don't think it is necessary to give a punishment. The reason why the Party gives a punishment to a Party member is to hope that he will become a good Party member. Now Comrade Wu Yuzhang has automatically done this, so I don't think it is necessary to give a punishment. It is only necessary to make a resolution, pointing out his mistakes, commending him for admitting his mistakes, understanding his mistakes, and being willing to fight against the mistakes. This is the attitude that a Party member should have. Finally, I hope that he will deepen his theoretical research to complete his task of being willing to fight against incorrect theories."

　　Everyone unanimously agreed with this proposal and made a resolution according to Comrade Lin Boqu's opinion. After this, the Party members and responsible comrades not only did not despise Comrade Wu Yuzhang because he had made mistakes, but instead trusted and respected him even more, thinking that his loyalty to the Party could serve as a model for Party members.

　　So this time, the Trotskyists failed to attack Comrade Wu Yuzhang, but instead showed Comrade Wu Yuzhang's excellent Bolshevik qualities even more.

　　This frank loyalty to the Party and serious attitude towards self-criticism are what every Communist Party member should learn from Comrade Wu Yuzhang. (End of this section, the full text is not finished)

　　吴玉章同志革命故事（七续）
    何其芳
  　和托派斗争
    今天中国的托派已经堕落到不能公开他们的面目了，但是他们仍然在用他们的卖身钱办这样杂志，办那样杂志，说中国共产党进行的土地改革不够“彻底”呵！说联合政府就是把政权“交给”资产阶级呵。之类，仿佛他们是最“彻底”的一样。但是，在一切进步的刊物以至自由主义者的刊物都被反动派查禁时，这些托派杂志却都是印得有“内政部登记证京警沪字第×××号”，通行无阻，则也就一下子泄露出他们的“身份”了。无论用什么说法，都是与那些国民党的公开特务报一样，尽其反共任务而已。
    就是当托洛斯基派还未堕落到这样时，他们对于中国革命的意见实际也就是有利于中国反革命派的。象陈独秀，原来主张中国的民主革命让中国的资产阶级去领导，因此一切投降大地主大资产阶级；而后来却又成为托洛斯基的信徒，相信中国已无封建势力，应该进行社会主义革命，因此就不应与中国的资产阶级合作。这岂不是奇怪已极吗？正是因为这样奇怪已极的“理论”永远无法行得通，他们才只有投入法西斯集团的怀抱里。
    吴玉章同志到苏联时，正碰到当时托派的活动。他们散发他们的宣传品到学生中。有一个中国印刷工人，被托派拉入他们的小组织里去了。党要清查他时，他来找吴玉章同志，说他是遭别人攻击，他不过看过旁人给他的托派传单而已。吴玉章同志并不知道他的实际情形，但却很有原则地劝他对党诚恳忠实，无论什么都讲出来。因为在当时，假若全部坦白讲了本来就没有什么。但这个人却骗吴玉章同志，说他没有什么隐瞒。过了两天，人家却证明他还有未坦白说出的事实，他这时再来找吴玉章同志，吴玉章同志就不理他了。结果他被开除出党。
    在海参威教书时，远东出版局要吴玉章同志编一本中文教科书。他当时因事忙，就摘录了一些斯大林的讲演和沈泽民同志在莫斯科编的一本中文教本内的几篇文章，再加上几篇他自己作的文章，编成一本书。当时托派分子在远东相当多，和吴玉章同志他们斗争得很激烈。书一出版，他们就在远东边疆党部告了吴玉章同志说他犯了许多机会主义的错误。吴玉章同志听说后，大为惊讶，马上把他们所指摘之处细细检查，果然在他自己作的文章里发见了一个错误，就是只简单地说苏联消灭富农，而没有说在农业集体化的基础上来消灭富农，而沈泽民同志所选的几篇文章，其中关于中国革命问题，国家问题，道德问题等，也有一些错误。因为吴玉章同志认为沈泽民同志是理论修养很好的，他选的文章不会有错误，故编时未细心考究它们的内容。于是吴玉章同志就花了半个月的工夫，把马克思、列宁、斯大林关于这些问题的理论加紧研究。当他深刻地了解了这些问题后，他给党的支部写了一篇很长的声明书，其中把这些错误都写了出来，就是托派没有看出而他自己认为错误的地方也写出来，并对错误的来源加以检讨，说明他对于自己作的或选别人的文章上的错误都愿完全负责，并誓与这些错误观点作斗争，以保持布尔什维克党的理论的纯洁，最后请求党给他以严重的处罚，以作党员不加深学习和作事轻率疏忽的教训。
    接着党就开支部会议来讨论这问题。吴玉章同志又诚恳地将声明书中的内容口头报告一遍。许多同志都说他对党忠实，坦白承认错误，并且认识错误深刻，改正错误也诚恳坚决，处罚应从轻。有的说应给以轻微的警告，有的说给以劝告就够了。最后林伯渠同志却说：“我认为不必给以处罚。党之所以给党员以一种处罚，是希望他成为一个好党员。现在吴玉章同志自动地就作到了这点，所以我认为不必给以处罚，只须作一决议，指出他的错误，嘉许他承认错误，认识错误，并愿和错误作斗争，这是党员应有的态度，最后还希望他加深理论研究来完成他愿和不正确理论作斗争的任务，就够了。”
    大家一致赞成这个提议，真就照着林伯渠同志的意见作了一个决议，在这以后，党员群众和负责同志不但不因吴玉章同志犯过错误而轻视他，反而对他更加信任，尊敬，认为他对党的忠诚可作党员模范。
    所以这一次，托派并未能打击吴玉章同志，反而因此更显出来了吴玉章同志的优美的布尔什维克的品质。
    这种对党的坦白忠诚，对自我批评的严肃认真，是每一个共产党员都应该向吴玉章同志学习的。（本节完，全文未完）
