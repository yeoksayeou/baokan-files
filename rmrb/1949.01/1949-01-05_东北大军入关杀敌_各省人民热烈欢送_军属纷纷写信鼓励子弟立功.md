Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 31st: Belated news: After jubilantly celebrating the liberation of the entire Northeast, the people of Northeast China are enthusiastically seeing off the Northeast Field Army as it enters the pass to kill the enemy. People from Songjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, Shenyang and other provinces and cities organized慰问团 (comfort groups) to rush to the garrisons of the Northeast Field Army to express their condolences and bid farewell. At a send-off meeting for a certain unit entering the pass, Yan Baohang, Chairman of Liaobei Province, said to all the commanders and fighters: "The hearts of 38 million people in the Northeast are expecting you to use even greater victories to complete the complete victory of the Chinese people." Chairman Feng of Songjiang Province, on behalf of all the people of Songjiang, presented a large flag to a certain unit, hoping that the unit would plant this flag on the city of Beiping. Military dependents also wrote letters encouraging their sons to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service. Wang, an old lady from Jixian urban area of ​​Hejiang Province, wrote to her son saying: You must work hard to kill the enemy and come back after defeating Chiang Kai-shek and liberating the whole of China. Zhu, an old man from Changtu County, Liaobei Province, personally ran to Shenyang and found his son who was a political instructor of a certain unit company and said: "You must lead all the fighters of the entire company into the pass to complete the revolutionary task, and I will go to Beiping and Nanjing to see you in the future." When the Field Army marched into the pass, all districts and villages along the way established "Reception Stations for Troops Entering the Pass" and "Rice, Grass, Firewood and Oil Supply Stations", and pine branch gates were set up in streets and alleys. The walls and courtyards were covered with slogans such as "Welcome the Northeast People's Liberation Army to Enter the Pass and Cooperate with the Brother Units in North China to Liberate Peiping and Tianjin!" and "Fight to Nanjing and Capture Chiang Kai-shek Alive!" Farmers in each village set up basins of boiled water and fruit at the gates and roadsides to entertain the passing soldiers. When a certain unit marched past Linglong Pagoda, the mass band played a farewell song, and the soldiers happily danced the Yangko to the music. When the troops passed through the newly recovered Xingcheng and Suizhong areas, the farmers in each village also beat gongs and drums to welcome them. When the troops were camping, the local people automatically vacated their houses for the troops to live in, heated the kang (platform bed), boiled water for the soldiers, and brought out a large number of eggs, peanuts, and pears to慰劳 (express sympathy to) the soldiers. When several carts carrying sick soldiers from a certain regiment passed by a certain village, the farmers in the village threw pears onto the carts. The sick soldiers declined, but the farmers threw the pears onto the carts and left. The soldiers were greatly moved by the warm welcome of their fellow villagers and expressed that "After entering the pass, we must cooperate well with the brother units in the pass, resolutely fight to Nanjing, and liberate the whole of China!"

　　The Torrent Pouring into Shanhaiguan
    The huge torrent of the Northeast Field Army poured into Shanhaiguan, and the people of Shanhaiguan celebrated as if it were the New Year. These days, the people of Shanhaiguan have been busy welcoming the Northeast Army into the pass in a warm celebration. A red flag on the city tower is fluttering in the wind. On both sides of the giant plaque of "The First Majestic Pass in the World" are pasted fresh and vivid slogans: "A Thousand Miles of Marching, Truly Iron Feet," "Entering the Pass to Kill the Enemy is Heroic," "Long Live the March to Peiping and Tianjin." From Dongluocheng to Xiluocheng, the road is full of red and green flags, and eighteen tall decorated archways stand tall. Drum and music sheds and tea sheds are set up along the road. At night, the lights are brilliant, like a lantern festival.
    Before the sun came out, people were busy. All the Yangko teams were busy getting dressed up. The students of Shanhaiguan Middle School tied thousands of glorious flowers, and the students of the Women's Normal School took out their carefully embroidered handkerchiefs, ready to give them to the PLA soldiers. People from all walks of life wrote more than 700 letters of condolence overnight, and prepared a large number of peanuts, red dates, and pears, waiting for the arrival of the PLA.
    The streets were filled with welcoming crowds, everyone wanted to see the heroic posture of the army entering the pass, and no one wanted to be left behind, so they stepped on the tables one by one. The walls were crowded like a mountain of people, stretching from Xiguan to the hills of Dongguan. The gongs and drums rang, and the Yangko and stilts were all twisted out. The old ladies were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths and said, "Shanhaiguan is celebrating the New Year today."
    The troops are here. The majestic military music is coming from outside the pass. Thousands of eyes immediately turn to the huge city tower. In an instant, under the giant plaque of "The First Majestic Pass in the World", four brocade flags appeared. At the front was the military band, with various musical instruments shining with dazzling gold. The troops were in four columns, and the soldiers were full of energy, stepping into Shanhaiguan with neat steps. The mountain of people exploded, and the crowd surged forward like a tide. The two torrents of welcoming and being welcomed immediately converged, and the loud slogans merged into one: "Salute to the meritorious Northeast People's Liberation Army!" "Open Peiping and Tianjin to answer the welcome of the people!" Representatives presenting flowers and flags handed bouquets of flowers and a banner of "Make Persistent Efforts to Liberate the Whole of China" to the representatives of the PLA. People grabbed peanuts, red dates and pears and stuffed them into the soldiers' pockets, but the soldiers clenched their pockets and dodged with a smile. Small-footed women stuffed慰劳品 (comfort items) into the PLA comrades' grenade pouches, and then burrowed back into the crowd.
    The common people glanced at the PLA's eighteen-horse-drawn giant cannons and brand-new and well-equipped equipment, and excitedly pointed and gesticulated and discussed: "Looking at this team with such well-equipped equipment, it's no wonder the Kuomintang is running away." An old man in a village near Shanhaiguan, when he saw the team passing day and night, nodded happily and said: "I hoped it would come one day, but it didn't come. I hoped it would come two days, but it didn't come. Now it's here. It hasn't finished passing after three days and three nights. Fu Zuoyi is finished this time."

　　东北大军入关杀敌
  　各省人民热烈欢送
    军属纷纷写信鼓励子弟立功
    【新华社哈尔滨三十一日电】迟到消息：东北各地人民在狂欢庆祝东北全境解放后，又热烈欢送东北野战军进关杀敌。松江、辽北、吉林、沈阳等各省市人民，组织慰问团赶赴野战军各部驻地，进行慰问欢送。在欢送某部入关的大会上，辽北省阎宝航主席向全体指战员们说：“东北三千八百万人的心正在期待你们，用更大的胜利来完成中国人民的彻底胜利。”松江省冯主席则代表松江全体人民送给某部一面大旗，希望该部把这面旗帜插在北平城上。军属们也纷纷写信勉励自己的子弟杀敌立功。合江省集贤城区王老太太给她儿子写信说：你要努力杀敌人，等到打倒蒋介石解放全中国后再回来。辽北省昌图县的朱老大爷亲自跑到沈阳，找到在某部当连政治指导员的儿子说：“你要好好带领全连战士进关，完成革命任务，将来我还要到北平、南京去看你。”当野战军向关里源源开进时，大军所过之处，沿途各区村都成立“进关部队招待所”和“米草柴油供给站”，大街小巷都扎了松枝门，墙院上、树上贴满“欢送东北解放军进关，配合华北兄弟部队解放平津！”“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”的标语。各村农民在门口、道旁摆满了一盆盆的开水和果子，招待过路战士。某部行军路过玲珑塔时，群众鼓乐队奏出欢送歌，战士们高兴得和着音乐扭起秧歌来。部队经过新收复的兴城绥中地区，每村农民也都敲锣打鼓，夹道欢送。部队宿营时，当地人民自动把房子腾出，让给部队住，给战士们烧炕，烧水，并拿出大批的鸡蛋、花生、梨子慰劳战士。某团几辆运送病号的大车路过某村时，该村农民将梨子扔上车去，生病的战士们都谢绝了；但农民又把梨子扔到车上就走。战士们对于家乡父老这种热烈欢送大受感动，纷纷表示：“进关后，一定要好好配合关里兄弟部队，坚决打到南京去，解放全中国！”
　　涌进山海关的洪流
    东北野战军的巨大洪流，涌进了山海关，山海关的人民狂欢得如过新年。山海关的人民这些天都在热烈的欢腾中忙于迎接东北大军入关。城楼上的一面红旗在迎风招展着，“天下第一雄关”的巨匾两边，张贴着新鲜生动的标语“千里行军真铁脚”，“进关杀敌是英雄”，“向平津进军万岁”。从东罗城一直到西罗城，沿途插满了一串串的红绿小旗，矗立着十八座高大的牌楼，路旁搭起了鼓乐棚、茶棚。一到晚上，灯火辉煌，如过灯节。
    太阳还没出来，人们便忙了起来，所有的秧歌队都在忙着化装。山海关中学的同学们，扎好了千百朵光荣花，女师的同学拿出她们精心刺绣的手帕，准备送给解放军战士。各界人士一夜写好了七百多封慰问信，预备下大批的花生、红枣、梨子等，等候着解放军的到来。
    街道上到处堆满了欢迎的人群，大家都想看看入关大军的雄姿，谁也不肯落后，一个个踏在桌子上。墙头挤得象一座人山，从西关一直排到东关的山岗上。锣鸣鼓响，秧歌高跷一齐扭了出来，老大娘乐的嘴都合拢不住说：“山海关今天过新年了。”
    队伍来了，雄壮的军乐，从关外传进来了，千万只眼睛，立刻转向巨大的城楼下面。刹那间，在“天下第一雄关”的巨匾下，出现了四面锦旗，最前面是军乐队，各种乐器闪着一片耀眼的金光，队伍排成四路纵队，战士们个个精神百倍，踏着整齐的步伐进入了山海关。人山爆裂了，人群象潮水一样的向前涌去，欢迎的与被欢迎的两股巨流立刻会合起来，响亮的口号声混成一团：“向劳苦功高的东北解放军致敬！”“打开平津答复老百姓的欢迎！”献花献旗的代表，把一束束的花和一面“再接再厉解放全中国”的锦旗，送到解放军代表的手里。人们拿着花生红枣和梨子硬往战士的衣袋里塞，战士们用手捏紧口袋，笑着躲开。小脚娘们，把慰劳品硬塞入解放军同志们的手榴弹袋里后，便钻回人群里去了。
    老百姓瞥着解放军的十八匹马拉着的巨炮和崭新整齐的装备，都兴奋的指手划脚议论着：“看这队伍装备这样整齐，无怪国民党要吓跑了。”山海关附近某村一个老大爷，当看到队伍成天整夜的过着，高兴的连连点头说：“盼一天不来盼两来不来，可盼来了。过了三天三夜还没过完，傅作义这一下可要完蛋了。”
