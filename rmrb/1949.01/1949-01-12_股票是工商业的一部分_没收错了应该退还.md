　　Stocks are Part of Industry and Commerce; Wrongful Confiscation Should be Returned
　　To the Editor:
    The Xingtai Fourth District has eight pharmacies that own two shares of Ruihua Bank stock, each with a face value of 10,000 yuan. The stocks are registered under the names of Wu Xiangting and Du Jingxing, with each holding one share. During the "May Fourth" mass movement, the four pharmacies represented by Wu Xiangting were subjected to struggle sessions, and all their property was confiscated. All documents were moved to the storage room, and the whereabouts of Wu's stock became unknown. After much investigation, we discovered that the stock was in the possession of Shang Zengshan, who was responsible for storing the materials at the time. Shang even sought a guarantor to withdraw dividends when Ruihua Bank distributed them. Was this stock distributed to him by the masses, or was it stolen? How should this issue be handled? Should it be returned to the masses or to the original owner? What should be done with the dividends Shang withdrew? Please reply.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Yin Kaishan, Xingtai)
    Comrade Yin Kaishan: You mentioned that the five pharmacies represented by Wu Xiangting were subjected to struggle sessions and their property was confiscated. Because the reasons for the struggle sessions, the subsequent handling of these properties, and the source of Shang Zengshan's stock were not specified, it is difficult for us to provide a specific answer. However, if the confiscation was in accordance with policy regulations, including the stocks, they cannot be returned. If the confiscation was wrongful, they should be returned or appropriately compensated; however, this must be done through the government and the masses. It is not appropriate to demand them directly from the people who received the fruits of the confiscation. If Shang Zengshan privately stole the confiscated stock and used it to withdraw dividends from the bank, this is an illegal act. He should return the stock and the withdrawn dividends to the masses for them to handle according to their opinions. If the confiscation was wrongful, Wu Xiangting can, through the government and the masses, have Shang Zengshan return the stock and the withdrawn dividends to him.

### 股票是工商业的一部分　没收错了应该退还

专栏：询问与答复

　　股票是工商业的一部分
  　没收错了应该退还编辑同志：
    邢市四区八家药行，有瑞华银行股票两张，每股一万元，股票上写的是武香亭、杜景星，并由武杜二人各存一张。“五四”群运时，武香亭代表的四家药行被斗，财物全被没收，一切单据统统搬到保管室，武之股票即不知下落。后经多方追究，我们才发觉股票乃在当时负责保管物资的尚增山手中，在瑞华银行分红时尚某还曾讨保将红利提出，这张股票，不知是群众分给他的，或是盗窃的？此问题究应如何处理？应归群众或该归原主？为尚某提出的红利应该怎样处理？请作复。　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（邢台尹开山）
    尹开山君：你说武香亭所代表的五家药行被斗争，财产被没收。因未说明被斗原因，这些财产已经如何处理及尚增山的股票来源，故我们很难具体回答。但若按照政策规定应予没收者，包括股票在内，不能要退。若是没收错了，则应退还，或得到适当的补偿；但这事情必须通过政府和群众，自己向分得果实的人去要是不对的。而尚增山如私自将没收的股票窃为己有向银行提取红利，则是违法的行为，他应将该股票和所提的红利还给群众，按群众的意见来处理。要是没收错了，武香亭就可以通过政府、群众，让尚增山把股票和提出的红利还他。
