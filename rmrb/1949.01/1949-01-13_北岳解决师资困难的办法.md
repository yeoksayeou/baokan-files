　　The Beiyue District, in its efforts to restore and reorganize national education, deeply felt the shortage of teachers, which hindered the recovery of national education. The low level of teachers also severely limited the reorganization of national education. In order to solve this important problem, the district adopted the following measures, which have achieved considerable results, and are hereby reported: (1) Mass training of intellectuals in rural areas: Around the autumn vacation, the district, using counties as units, adopted short-term training methods (half a month to twenty days) to train a considerable number of intellectuals in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, 921 people were trained during the autumn vacation, plus the 441 people trained by Guangling, Tianzhen, and Chanan Normal Schools before the autumn vacation, totaling 1,361 people. The vast majority of them have been added to the teaching staff. For example, in the first district, where the training work was the best, 768 people were trained, and 655 of them were added to the teacher vacancies, which greatly benefited the restoration of schools. Currently, the district has decided to continue to train vigorously, and it is expected that at least another 800 people will be trained before June this year. The Beiyue Administrative Cadre School and the Fourth District Training Class have been prepared and are mobilizing intellectuals in rural areas. Currently, enrollment is not yet enthusiastic. According to inspection, there are the following reasons: First, some intellectuals still lack a clear understanding of our policies and remain skeptical and wait-and-see; Second, many people are already in charge of household affairs and cannot leave; Third, some people were not properly assigned jobs after training in the past, or they were afraid of being assigned too far from home. These problems should be solved. (2) Holiday training for in-service teachers: In order to solve the problem of low educational level, the district, during the autumn vacation, all counties successively opened primary school teacher training classes. According to available statistics, a total of 3,725 people were trained, with the longest time being eighteen days and the shortest being three days. The training content varied depending on the different situations of the teachers. Some focused on improving cultural skills, while others focused on political policy education. An appraisal and grading were conducted during the training. Jianping County also rewarded Feng Xuetai, an old teacher who had been teaching for 27 consecutive years, which was well received by the teachers. (3) Mobilizing demobilized teachers to resume their posts: In the past, the district had experienced inappropriate dismissals of primary school teachers during the land reform. Around the autumn vacation, it universally carried out the work of striving to mobilize teachers to resume their posts, which has yielded some results and needs to be continued. According to statistics from the First and Fourth Districts alone, out of 240 demobilized teachers, 97 have resumed their posts, which is not a large proportion. It is reported that the reason is that many people have changed to other jobs.

　　北岳解决师资困难的办法
    北岳区在恢复整顿国民教育工作，深感师资的缺乏，障碍着国民教育的恢复；教员程度的不高，在整顿国民教育上也受到很大限制。为了解决这一重要问题，该区曾以下列办法，收到效果不小，特报导如下：（一）大量训练在乡知识分子：该区在秋假前后，曾以县为单位，采取短期训练方式（半月至二十天），训练了相当数量的在乡知识分子。据不完整统计，秋假中即有九百二十一名，加上秋假前广灵、天镇、察南师范所训练的四百四十一人，共达一千三百六十一名，绝大部分都补充了师资。如训练工作最好的一专区，共训练七百六十八名，即有六百五十五名补充了教师缺额，对学校的恢复上，有很大益处。现该区决定继续以大力来训练，预计在今年六月前至少再训练八百名。北岳行政干校与四专训练班已筹备就绪，正动员在乡知识分子中，现在报名者尚不踊跃。据检查有以下原因：一、有些知识分子对我之政策还缺乏清楚的了解，仍怀疑观望；二、许多人已支掌家务脱离不开；三、过去有些训练后未能适当的分配工作，或是怕分配离家太远。这些问题应设法解决。（二）假期训练在职教员：该区为了解决教育程度低的问题，在秋假期间，各县都先后开办了小学教员训练班，据已有材料统计，共训练三千七百二十五名，时间上最长的十八天，最短的为三天。训练内容，由于教员的情况不同而异，有的着重文化业务的提高；有的着重政治政策的教育。在训练中进行了鉴定及评等级。建屏县并对连续教学二十七年的老教员封学太实行了奖励，教员反映甚好。（三）动员停战之教员复职：该区过去在土改中曾发生不适当的小学教员停职现象，在秋假前后即普遍的进行了争取动员复职工作，已收到一些效果，尚须继续争取。仅据一、四专区统计，二百四十名停职教员中，已复职者九十七名，比重尚不大，据悉原因是有不少人已改作其他工作。
