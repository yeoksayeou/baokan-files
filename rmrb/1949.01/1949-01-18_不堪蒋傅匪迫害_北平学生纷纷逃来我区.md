　　Unable to Endure Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi Bandits' Persecution,
  　Beiping Students Flee to Our Liberated Area in Droves
    [Jidong 12th Dispatch] University and middle school students in Beiping city, unable to endure the persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits, are breaking through layer upon layer of blockades and continuously fleeing to the liberated areas. Our Tongzhou Municipal Government has specially set up the "Beiping-Tianjin Student Reception Center" to accommodate students fleeing to our area. As of the 10th of this month, it has already accommodated more than 300 students from Northeast First Provisional Middle School, Peking University, and other universities and middle schools. On the 7th alone, 47 students fled to the reception center, receiving the cordial reception of our democratic government. They denounced the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits, saying, "They (referring to the bandit troops) treat the schools as barracks, forcibly organizing students into the 'Youth Self-Salvation Vanguard Team' and 'Winter Camp,' issuing only ten liang of cornmeal per day to students staying at school, and coercing them by saying, 'If you're afraid of going hungry, join the Vanguard Team for training!'" Wang Guitang, a student from Beiping Private Dacheng Middle School, said, "Our private school has been suspended for a long time. Students staying at school can only eat a small steamed bun of less than five liang per meal!" Ma Jingshan, a student from Northeast First Provisional Middle School, said, "The Kuomintang simply doesn't treat students as human beings. The lessons of the July 5th Massacre are too profound for us!" A student from Peking University said, "The Kuomintang asked us to move south. The students held a meeting and firmly refused to go, waiting for the People's Liberation Army to enter the city."

　　不堪蒋傅匪迫害
  　北平学生纷纷逃来我区
    【冀东十二日电】北平城内的大、中学校学生，不堪受蒋傅匪的迫害，突破重重封锁，不断逃来解放区。我通州市政府特设“平津学生招待所”，收容逃来我区的学生，截止本月十日，已收容东北第一临中、北京大学等大中学校学生三百多名，七日一天内就有四十七名逃来招待所，受到我民主政府的亲切招待。他们控诉蒋傅匪的暴行说：“他们（指匪军）把学校当做兵营，强迫学生组织‘青年自救先锋队’‘冬令营’，对留校住宿的学生每天只发玉米面十两，并胁迫说：‘怕挨饿就入先锋队受训！’”北平私立大成中学学生王贵堂说：“我们私立学校早就停课了，留校同学每顿饭只能吃到一个不足五两的小饽饽！”东北第一临中学生马井山说：“国民党根本就不拿学生当人看，七五惨案给我们的教训太深了！”北京大学一位同学说：“国民党叫我们南迁，同学们开了会，坚决不走，等着解放军进城。”
