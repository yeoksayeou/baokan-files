　　New Year Visit to Military Family Member, Granny Li
    Shang Kai
    The sun had just climbed over the mountains in the southeast, and the small courtyard of Granny Li, a military family member in Lizhuang Village, Yiqu District, Pingshan, was completely bathed in the winter sunlight.
    Eleven or twelve-year-old Xiao Ruizhang came back from school, hopping and skipping. He took the reporter's hand and, just stepping into his house, shouted loudly: "Mother, the comrades from the newspaper are here!" Granny Li, smoothing her hair with one hand and dusting off her body with the other, hurried out.
    "Come inside and sit, it's cold outside!" Granny Li's expression was surprised, joyful, and affectionate.
    When the reporter sat on her newly distributed red lacquered wooden box and explained his purpose: "The New Year is coming, we're here to visit you!" Granny Li chuckled, "That's good, I was hoping you'd come! Seeing you, it's like seeing my Xingzhang." She stopped laughing and solemnly told the reporter: "My Xingzhang joined the army this spring; I – his mother – signed him up. I said: If we don't do it, who will? A mother sending her son to the battlefield, I've known this saying for a long time."
    The conversation naturally turned to this year's harvest.
    "This year was dry, and the grain harvest wasn't much. In the autumn, we should have handed in three hundred eighty or ninety catties of public grain; guess what I did? I scraped it all together and handed it all in at once, winning first place and even a model title!"
    "Is there enough to eat at home now?"
    "Enough to eat, enough; you don't need to worry about me. This year, I planted some radishes and turnips, and there's still some grain at home, and I can mix in some fine bran? Isn't that enough to eat? It's just me and my son, we can manage somehow. Didn't I say? Even if the heavens make it difficult, our troops have to be fed!"
    "I always say: If we didn't starve or freeze to death before, we won't starve to death in the future. A few years ago, when his father was still alive, the four of us, what did we eat?! It was either vegetables or bran, we rarely saw a grain of rice, my two children grew up eating locust beans." Granny Li's eyes filled with tears as she spoke, and she lowered her head.
    After a moment of silence, Granny Li secretly wiped away her tears and smiled again. She happily said: "Now we have houses and land, and we planted several acres of wheat this autumn, whether it's difficult or not, we won't starve anyway. I often say to his two brothers: If it weren't for the Communist Party leading us to turn over, how could we live such a life!?"
    When asked if there were any difficulties at home, Granny Li answered very simply:
    "No difficulties." She said: "Ten acres of land, the village helps with the farming; for some odd jobs that are light and easy, my son and I can handle it. In the spring and winter when we are idle, I spin cotton to earn some pocket money, and send Xiao Ruizhang to school to study. There are no difficulties at all!"
    "They're fighting in Beijing now, did you know that, Granny Li?" the reporter asked.
    "Our village's stretcher team set off a long time ago, I know they're fighting in Beijing; when Beijing is taken, it'll be time to live a peaceful life. Do you know, those few years, the Japanese devils, traitors, and stubborn troops, they scared us terribly – I ask you, I don't know if my Xingzhang is still in the north?"
    "He's in the north, and he'll be participating in the fight for Beijing. Granny Li, do you want to send him a letter? It's the New Year, our military families can write letters to the soldiers in the newspaper, and the soldiers can see them wherever they go."
    "Really?" Granny Li was even happier, "That old Comrade Liu who lives in our village said the same thing to me, I asked him to write a letter to Xingzhang for me, and he read it to me, it sounded just like what I was thinking, he said he mailed it to the newspaper."
    "Yes, that's good." The reporter then asked Xiao Ruizhang: "What do you want to tell your brother?" He just smiled and said nothing, and Granny Li urged him, "Speak, tell your big brother!"
    Xiao Ruizhang thought for a long time, suddenly puffed out his little mouth, and looked up and said: "Tell him: Capture old Chiang and come home early!" In the end, Granny Li repeatedly urged: "Seeing you is like seeing my Xingzhang, you must deliver that letter."
    As the reporter walked out of the village, Granny Li was still leaning at the door, looking into the distance.

　　新年访军属李大娘
    商恺
    太阳刚刚爬上了东南的山头，平山一区里庄村军属李大娘的小院子便完全浸浴在冬日的阳光里。
    十一二岁的小瑞章连蹦带跳地从学校里回来，拉着记者的手，刚踏进他的宅门，便大声招呼：“娘，报社的同志来了。”李大娘一手抚着头发，一手打扑着身上的土，慌忙走出来。
    “屋里坐吧，看在外边冷！”李大娘的神情是惊疑、喜悦、又是亲切。
    当记者坐在她刚分得的红漆板箱上，说明来意：“要过年了，来看望你老人家哩！”李大娘就呵呵的笑起来：“这可是好，我正盼着你们来哩！看见了你们，就象是看见了俺兴章一样。”她停住了笑声，郑重地告诉记者：“今年春上俺兴章参军，是为娘的——我给他报上的名。你说：咱不干谁干？母亲送儿上战场，这话我早就念熟了。”
    谈话很自然地转到了今年的收成。
    “今年天旱，打的粮食不多。秋季公粮咱就该出三百八九十斤；你猜我怎么办的？叫我扑拉了扑拉，一总子都交上了，抢了个头份，还争了个模范哩！”
    “现在家里够不够吃的呢？”
    “够吃的，够了；你们不用挂着我。今年种了些萝卜、蔓菁，家里还有些粮食，再搀点细糠？还不够吃的吗？就俺娘儿俩，怎么也好办。我没说吗？天作难也得叫咱们的队伍吃饱啊！”
    “我常说：先前没饿死冻死，往后就饿不死了。头几年，他爹还活着，一家四口子，吃的是什么呀！？不是菜就是糠，轻易见不到个粮食粒，俺这两个孩子就是吃槐子豆长大的。”李大娘说到这里，两眼挤满了泪，低下头去。
    经过片刻沉默之后，李大娘偷偷擦干眼泪，又笑了。他高兴的说：“这会有房子有地啦，今年秋里又种了好几亩麦子，作难不作难，反正饿不着啦。我常对他兄弟俩说：要不是共产党来领导咱翻身，咱怎么会过得上这样的时光！？”
    谈到家中有些什么困难时，李大娘回答得很干脆：
    “没有困难。”她说：“十来亩地，村里给代耕；有些零碎轻便活，俺娘俩也就办啦。春冬两闲，我纺棉花赚个零花消，叫小瑞章到学里去念书。这可是没有什么困难啦！”
    “现在正打北京哩，李大娘你知道了吗？”记者问。
    “俺村担架队老早就出发了，我可是知道打北京哩；打了北京，就到了过安生日子的时候了。你知不道哩，那几年鬼子汉奸顽固军，闹得俺可怕呢——我问你，俺兴章也不知还在北边吗？”
    “在北边哩，他也要参加打北京的。李大娘，你给他捎信吗？过年哩，咱们军属可以在报上给战士写信，战士走到那里也能看见。”
    “真吗？”李大娘更高兴了，“在俺村住的那个老刘同志也这样给我说，我叫他给兴章写了一封信，给我念了一遍，听着可对我的心思呢，他说他给邮到报社里去啦。”
    “对，那就行了。”记者又问小瑞章：“你对你哥哥有什么话嘱咐他？”他光笑不说，李大娘也催着他：“说，给你这一个哥哥说！”
    小瑞章想了半天，忽然鼓了鼓小嘴，仰起脸来说道：“给他说吧：逮住了老蒋早回家！”最后李大娘再三叮嘱：“看见了你们就象看见了俺兴章一样，你们可把那信捎到。”
    记者走出了村头，李大娘还依在门口了望。
