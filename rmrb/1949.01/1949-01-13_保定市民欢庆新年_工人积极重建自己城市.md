[Jizhong, 7th dispatch] The 100,000 citizens of Baoding are celebrating their first New Year after liberation with unparalleled joy. On New Year's Day, factories, schools, and shops all hung national flags and cleaned their premises, and brightly colored new-style couplets were everywhere. Lion dances, Shaolin performances, stilt walkers, and "inch-stilt" performers, which had been rare for a decade, paraded through the streets. Propaganda teams and singing groups from various schools were also active in the streets. Employees of the electric company voluntarily proposed to forgo their New Year's holiday and celebrate the first New Year after liberation with practical actions. They are now enthusiastically rushing to repair equipment damaged by bandits. Zhang Yuru, the business section chief of the company, has been voluntarily extending his work hours by seven hours in recent days to rush the repair of broken meters. The railway worker picket brigade checked and summarized its work before the New Year, and in the one month and nine days since liberation, it has identified materials and supplies worth a total of 1.27 million new currency units, and commended 20 of the most active team members, including Gao Liying and Li Yonghe. Small-scale citizen forums have been held in various districts and streets, and some have also held forums for military families and industrial and commercial households to discuss the domestic and international situation and policies. The city was brightly lit at night, and a large meeting of 8,000 citizens was held in the first and third districts, shouting slogans to support the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army in liberating Tianjin and Beiping. The cheers of the city resounded until late at night.

[Jizhong, 7th dispatch] "Clearing the Clouds to See the Sun" is the jubilant phrase used by the poor small business people of the Baoding People's Market to celebrate their resumption of business on New Year's Day. The Puyu Market in the city was forcibly occupied by Liu Yanfu, the Kuomintang magistrate of Qingyuan County and a member of the Kuomintang Party Committee, in August of last year. After the liberation of Baoding, the unemployed poor people in the market demanded that the People's Government return the properties seized by the bandits and resume business. After investigation by the municipal government and street cadres, it was immediately decided to return the properties seized by the bandits and restore the market. The merchants were overjoyed when they heard the news. Under the leadership of district and street cadres, a market preparatory committee was organized to ensure that those who had been displaced and wished to return to the market could return to their original places. The remaining houses, due to outward migration and individual merchants unwilling to return to the market, were allocated to the poor and struggling merchants who were newly entering the market through a system of self-reporting and public discussion. After three weeks of adjustment and repair of the houses, the market opened on New Year's Day. To commemorate the support of the People's Government and the people themselves rebuilding the market on the rubble, the market was renamed the People's Market.

　　保定市民欢庆新年
  　工人积极重建自己城市
    【冀中七日电】保定市十万市民，以无比的欢欣，庆贺解放后的第一个新年。元旦日各工厂、学校、商店都悬国旗，打扫门庭，艳丽的新型对联满目皆是。十年来，很少出动狮子会、少林会、高跷会、寸跷会等在各街衢穿梭演出。各学校组成的宣传队、歌咏队，也活跃于街头。电灯公司的职工们，自动提出了免除年假，以实际行动来庆贺解放后的第一个新年。他们现正热情倍增的赶修被匪破坏的器材。该公司业务股长张玉如，近几天来自动延长七小时工作突击修理坏表。铁路工人纠察大队于年前检查总结工作，计解放以来一月零九天，共清查出总值一百二十七万元新币的器材物资，表扬了高立赢、李永和等二十名最积极的队员。各区街普遍召开了市民小型座谈会，还有的召开了军属、工商户座谈会，座谈国内外形势和政策。入夜灯火辉煌，一、三两区召开八千市民的大会上，高呼支援解放平津的东北、华北人民解放军。全市欢腾之声直至深夜。
    【冀中七日电】“拨云见日”，这是在新年元旦，保定人民市场贫民小商庆祝复业的狂欢语。该市普育市场，去年八月间被国民党清苑县长兼国民党的党部委员刘延福强占。保定解放后，市场失业的贫民要求人民政府发还匪占房产，重新复业。市府及街区干部经过调查，当即决定发还匪占民产，恢复市场。商民闻讯欣喜若狂。在区街干部领导下，组织了市场筹委会，确定流落在外愿回市场的人各归原处，因外迁及个别商民不愿回市场的剩余房屋，用自报公议办法尽先分给新入市场的贫苦商贩。经三周的调剂与修理房屋，已于元旦开市。为纪念人民政府的扶植，和纪念人民自己在瓦砾上重新把市场整顿起来，特将该市场改名为人民市场。
