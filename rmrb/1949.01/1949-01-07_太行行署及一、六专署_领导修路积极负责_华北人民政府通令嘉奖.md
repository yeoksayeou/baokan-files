　　Taihang Administrative Office and the First and Sixth Special Commissioner's Offices
  　Leaders Actively and Responsibly Repair Roads
  　North China People's Government Issues Circular of Commendation
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The Taihang Administrative Office and the First and Sixth Special Commissioner's Offices demonstrated a high degree of organization and planning in the repair of the Pinghan Railway foundation, actively and responsibly mobilizing the masses to repair roads, and received a commendation from the North China People's Government. After the Taihang Administrative Office received the telegram from the North China Government, it immediately relayed it to the special commissioner's offices, instructing them to carefully formulate engineering standards and construction methods. In addition to sending cadres from each county to participate in the county's organization and planning, the First Special Commissioner's Office also sent Section Chief Hu of the Special Commissioner's Office's Cooperation Section to personally supervise and guide each county. Each county organized a headquarters, led by the county magistrate or deputy county magistrate, with the participation of two or more section and bureau-level cadres. For example, in Gaoyi County, the deputy county magistrate, secretary, public security bureau chief, and education section chief participated. The district established a brigade headquarters, with the district head personally leading the work. The village established squads and teams, with at least two of the four main cadres (village head, Farmers' Association director, political director, and militia committee director) participating. The basic unit of the village was the group, with ten people per group, assigning activists or militiamen to each group to play a key role, and stipulating that each group bring tools such as carrying baskets and iron shovels. During the engineering process, propaganda and mobilization were combined with rewarding model workers. The mobilization slogans included "Repair the railway well and have coal to burn, save firewood and grass for composting to boost production," "Repair the railway well and reduce conscription," and "Pick up all the pebbles." The rewards for model workers included individual awards (towels, salt) and collective awards (banners, salt). Thanks to the meticulous planning and organization, and the responsible leadership of cadres who personally took charge and worked, the masses were highly motivated and labor efficiency was greatly improved. Most people went to work before dawn, and food and water were delivered to the construction site. The tamping was solid, and the pebbles were picked clean. Except for Cixian County, all work was completed before November 25, ahead of schedule. The North China People's Government commended the Taihang Administrative Office and its subordinate First and Sixth Special Commissioner's Offices on the 17th of last month for their active and responsible role in rushing to repair the railway, which has contributed greatly to restoring transportation, supporting the revolutionary war, developing transportation, and promoting economic prosperity.

　　太行行署及一、六专署
  　领导修路积极负责
  　华北人民政府通令嘉奖
    【本报讯】太行行署及一、六专署在修复平汉路基中发挥了高度的组织性与计划性，积极负责发动群众修路，获得华北人民政府嘉奖。当太行行署接到华北政府电令后，立即转令各专署慎重制定工程标准，施工办法。一专署除每县派去干部参加县的组织计划外，并派专署合作科胡科长亲赴各县督导。各县组织了指挥部，县长或副县长亲自领导，并有二个以上的科、局长干部参加。如高邑县有副县长、秘书、公安局长、教育科长等参加。区设大队部，区长亲自领导带工。村设中队和小队，村长、农会主任、政治主任、武委会主任四个主要干部中至少有二人参加。村的基本组织是班，每班十人，将积极分子或民兵分配各班起骨干作用，并规定每班带挑筐、铁锨等工具。在进行工程时，宣传动员与奖励模范相配合，白天大家做工，晚上开会检讨与评模范。提出的动员口号有“修好铁路有煤烧，省下柴草沤肥闹生产”，“修好铁路，少出勤务”，“石子要拣净”等。奖励模范规定有个人奖，奖给毛巾、食盐。集体奖奖给锦旗、食盐。该地区由于计划、组织之周密，领导干部能亲自负责，亲自动手，所以群众情绪非常高涨，劳动效率很大。多数群众都天不明上工，吃饭、喝水送到工地。夯打得实，石子拣得净。除磁县外，都在十一月二十五日前完工，提前完成了任务。华北人民政府对太行行署与其所属一、六专署抢修铁路，积极负责，对于恢复交通，支援革命战争，发展运输，繁荣经济，贡献实多，特于上月十七日通令嘉奖。（江）
