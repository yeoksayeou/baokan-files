　　How Did Zhao Shuli Become a Writer?
　　Wang Chun
　　Everyone loves to read Comrade Zhao Shuli's works, and therefore everyone wants to know about Comrade Zhao Shuli's experiences and life. In the past year or two, many articles introducing Zhao Shuli's life have appeared, but unfortunately, they are all based on rumors and imagination, and there are many inaccuracies. For example, some say that Zhao Shuli was a suona player, some say he was involved in old opera troupes, and so on. In fact, these are all rumors.
　　Zhao Shuli is from Qinshui County, Shanxi Province. His family was not a suona player's family, but a poor peasant family. This family and the rural environment in which he grew up brought three treasures to Comrade Zhao Shuli, ensuring that he would never exhaust them in his lifetime: The first treasure is that he understood the suffering of the peasants. His family originally cultivated ten or so acres of land, but the land was all mortgaged, meaning that they borrowed money against the land, and if the principal and interest were not paid on time, the creditor would take over the land and property. During the thirty years from his birth to the start of the Anti-Japanese War, his family and himself were constantly groaning under the heavy pressure of usurious loans. He experienced the threat of being swept out of the house by creditors. He experienced the pain of almost selling his younger sister out of desperation. He suffered the cold and wind of avoiding creditors in the dead of winter. In short, he was a poor man, he was the son of a poor man, and he truly knew what the hardship of the peasants tasted like. Understanding the peasants naturally also meant understanding the landlords, understanding the economic life of the countryside, and knowing how people from all walks of life in the countryside lived. The second treasure is that he was familiar with all aspects of rural knowledge, customs, human relations, and so on. In addition to farming, his father also engaged in side occupations such as weaving baskets, treating external injuries, and fabricating Qimen Dunjia (a form of divination); "Second Black Gets Married"'s "Second Kongming" (a character) takes the shadow of his father in the two aspects of superstition and emphasizing making money. But no matter what, this clever father was indeed proficient in rural "knowledge"; from useful things like wrapping wooden forks and installing sickle handles to superstitious things like calculating birthdates and choosing auspicious dates for travel, he knew everything and told it all to him. Zhao Shuli himself attended village schools, grazed cattle and donkeys, carried charcoal, picked up manure, followed others as a village leader to pray for rain, participated in weddings and funerals, visited relatives and paid New Year's greetings, in short, he lived in the countryside for so long, and with the "knowledge" left to him by his father, he could be considered truly familiar with the countryside. The third treasure is that he was versed in peasant art, especially in the field of music and drama. He participated in the peasant "Bayin Society" (a traditional music ensemble), and he could play all kinds of instruments, including gongs, drums, sheng (a reed pipe instrument), and dizi (a bamboo flute); he was close to opera performers, and he could handle all the musical instruments on the stage; he could tell stories after listening to storytellers, and he could perform tricks after watching street performers. He could play four instruments, including drums, cymbals, gongs, and spinning instruments, and he could also play the clapper with his tongue, and sing with a huqin (a bowed string instrument) in his mouth. Many times, mass meetings encountered his kind of performance, which raised the people's emotions to the highest level. His three treasures: the extremely high peasant righteous indignation for liberation, the very rich knowledge of rural life, and the enthusiasm for familiarizing himself with and loving peasant art, are the inexhaustible source for his later creation of works.
　　Zhao Shuli was not from an old opera troupe either, he actually never really joined an old opera troupe for even a day, he was a student, a graduate of the Changzhi Fourth Normal School in Shanxi Province. He was a lover of new literature and art, and he wrote new poems and new novels, and he really worked hard to study Westernization. But after leaving school, his creative ideas changed, and he said that in order for literature and art to be accepted by the masses, they must be popularized. The process of transformation was like this: in the first half of 1926, the young students of Shanxi, swept up in the tide of the Great Revolution, were still singing songs to overthrow the warlords. It goes without saying that the warlord of Shanxi was of course Yan Xishan, who should be overthrown. But soon things changed, and Yan Xishan proclaimed himself the "Third Commander-in-Chief of the Revolutionary Army," and was no longer a "warlord." He turned around and arrested "counter-revolutionary" communists. Zhao Shuli had to run, and after running around, he was finally arrested the following year, tried, and imprisoned. After coming out, he still ran around, sometimes relying on writing small articles to maintain his life. In these years, he interacted with literary and artistic youths on the one hand, and came into contact with rural people on the other. From the comparison of the cultural life of these two aspects, he saw that the new literature and art was still staying among a few intellectuals, while the broad masses of the people had no relationship with the new literature and art at all, and were still shrouded in feudal superstitions, martial arts, and lewd publications that created ignorance. Many literary and artistic authors disdained to pay attention to them, and they could not climb the threshold of literature and art. So he began to advocate writing things for the peasants and promoting popularization. But no one responded to him, and no one guided him. It was not until after the Anti-Japanese War, under the cultivation of the Communist Party, that his works found a way out, had the opportunity to be published, and were sent to the masses.
　　Everyone is reading Comrade Zhao Shuli's works, so I won't talk about them. At the same time, he is also multi-talented, able to write, play chess, and also paint a few landscape paintings, and can also carve seals, and loves crafts and small creations. He can also perform tricks and tell jokes, as long as he is present, it is guaranteed that men, women, old and young will not disperse all night. He can approach the masses, not only because his feelings are consistent with the masses, and not only because he understands the masses the most, these skills really help him a lot. Once, I once went with him to Songjiazhuang in Licheng, during the famine years, it was almost impossible to find a place to eat; it happened that someone was playing musical instruments on the millstone, he went, and one person played four or five kinds of instruments, singing and playing, and in an instant, half the village gathered; taking the opportunity to give a speech on the principles of self-help in overcoming the famine, he actually made the dejected people smile, collected food stamps and money for meals, and were all ready to find ways to produce.
　　Comrade Zhao Shuli is worthy of learning from. Learn from his style of closely linking with the masses, learn from his enthusiasm for serving the masses, learn from his spirit of learning to acquire multiple talents, learn from his love of mass art and his lively and humorous style towards the masses. Of course, it is even more necessary to read his works and learn from his articles.

### 赵树理怎样成为作家的？

　　赵树理怎样成为作家的？
    王春
    赵树理同志的作品大家都爱读，因此大家也都想知道赵树理同志的经历和生活。这一二年来，介绍赵树理生平的文章出现过好多篇，但可惜都是依据了一些传闻和想象，不合事实的地方非常多。比如有人说赵树理是吹鼓手出身，有人说是混旧戏班子的，还有其他等等。其实这些都是谣传。
    赵树理是山西沁水县人。他的家庭，并不是吹鼓手，而是一个贫农家庭。这个家庭和他生长的农村环境，给赵树理同志带来了三件宝，保证他一辈子使用不清：头一宝是他懂得农民的痛苦。他家原先种着十来亩地，但地上都带着笼头，就是说指地举债，到期本利不齐，债主就要拿地管业。从有他到抗战开始的三十年间，他的家和他自己是一直呻吟在高利债主的重压下的。被债主扫地出门的威胁，他经过。不得已几乎卖掉妹妹的惨痛，他经过。大腊月天躲避债主的风寒，他受过。总而言之，他是穷人，他是穷人的儿子，他真正知道农民的艰难是什么味道。懂得农民，自然也就懂得地主，懂得农村的经济生活，知道农村各阶层的日子都是怎么过着的。第二宝是他熟悉农村各方面的知识、习惯、人情等等。他的父亲除了种田，还以编簸箕、治外科、诌扯奇门遁甲等为副业；“小二黑结婚”上的“二孔明”，在迷信与强调弄钱这两点上，就是取的他父亲的影子。但不管怎么说，这位聪明的父亲，确是精通农村“知识”的；从有用的缠木杈、安镰把，到迷信的掐八字、择出行，无不知晓，无不告诉给他。赵树理自己上过村学、放过牛驴、担过炭、拾过粪，跟着人家当社头祈过雨，参与过婚丧大事、走过亲戚拜过年，总之是他在农村实顶实活了那么大，再加上他父亲遗给的那些“知识”，他就算得是真正熟悉农村了。第三宝是他通晓农民的艺术，特别是关于音乐戏剧这一方面的。他参加农民的“八音会”，锣鼓笙笛没一样弄不响；他接近唱戏的，戏台上的乐器件件可以顶一手；他听了说书就能自己说，看了把戏就能自己耍。他能一个人打动鼓、钹、锣、镟四样乐器，而且舌头打梆子，口带胡琴还不误唱。有多少次群众大会，碰上了他这种表演，使得人民情绪高扬到十分。他的这三件宝：极度高涨的农民求解放的义愤，非常丰富的农村生活的知识，熟悉与爱好农民艺术的热忱，就是他后来创造作品的不尽源泉。
    赵树理也不是混旧戏班子出身，他其实连一天旧戏班也没有真正混过，他是学生出身，山西省立长治第四师范学校初中毕业。他是新文艺的爱好者，写过新诗、新小说，着实努力学习过欧化。但是从学校出来以后，他的创作思想变化了，他说要得文艺为群众接受，非通俗化不可。转变过程是这个样子的，民国十五年上半年，卷在大革命浪潮里的山西青年学生，还在唱打倒军阀的歌。不说就明白，山西的军阀当然就是阎锡山，应该打倒。可是不久变了，阎锡山竟自称为“革命军的第三个总司令”，再也“不是军阀”了。反回头便大捉“反革命”的共产党。赵树理不得不跑，跑来跑去，第二年终于被捕了，受审、坐牢。出来以后，还是东奔西走，有时就靠写一点小文章维持生活。在这几年中，他一面和文艺青年来往，一面和农村老百姓接触着。他从这两方面的文化生活的对比上，看出了新文艺还是停留在少数知识分子中间，而广大人民呢，和新文艺一点不发生关系，还被制造愚昧的封建迷信武侠淫荡等等读物笼罩着。许多文艺作者不屑去理他们，他们也攀不着文艺的门坎。他于是开始提倡给农民写东西，提倡通俗化。可是没人响应他，也没人指导他。直到抗战以后，在共产党的培养下，他的作品才算是找到了出路，有了出版机会，送到了群众手里。
    赵树理同志的作品大家都在看，不去讲了。他同时又是多才多艺的，能写字下棋，还会画几笔山水画，也能刻图章，爱好工艺小创造。还能耍把戏，讲笑话，只要他一在场，管保男女老少通夜不散。他能够接近群众，不只是他的感情和群众一致，也不只是他懂得群众最多，这些艺能实在也帮助他不少。有一次，我曾经和他一路到过黎城的宋家庄，灾荒年间，简直找不上个吃饭处；恰好磨盘上有人玩乐器，他去了，一个人敲动四五样家伙，连打带唱，霎时聚下半村人；乘机把渡荒自救的道理讲演一番，居然说得垂头丧气的老百姓眉开眼笑，收下粮票款了饭，都准备设法去生产。
    赵树理同志是值得学习的。学习他密切联系群众的作风，学习他为群众服务的热忱，学习他那种取得多才多艺的学习精神，学习他对群众艺术的爱好和对群众的活泼风趣。看他的作品，学习他的文章，当然更是应该的事。
