Judging from the news items published today, the autonomous rights of women in marriage, as well as their human and property rights, are not fully guaranteed. Instances of unreasonable beatings, scolding, and maltreatment are not isolated phenomena in our region. This should arouse our serious attention. In the North China Liberated Area, where the feudal exploitative system has already been eliminated, why do these feudal and extremely unreasonable phenomena still exist in some areas? This is not surprising, because the Chinese people (both men and women) have long suffered under feudal oppression, and the shackles of feudal ideology are most severe on the people. Therefore, although women in the Liberated Areas have been liberated, and their status in politics, economy, society, and family has undergone fundamental changes; and although they have demonstrated their great role in the Liberation War, the land reform movement, and the production movement, it is still a long-term ideological education process to eradicate the remnants of this feudal ideology and abolish all feudal customs that bind women among all the people. In particular, due to the varying times of liberation in different regions and the varying strengths of the work foundation, this further forms the social cause of infringing upon women's human rights in some areas today. Precisely because of this, the concept of valuing men and belittling women, which was left over from the old society, and the constraints of various feudal customs, not only exist to varying degrees among the general masses of men and women, but also remain in some cadres. This is reflected in the lack of correct viewpoints and attitudes in dealing with women's issues. Instead of using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide their work, they one-sidedly emphasize the interests of men, and completely ignore the special interests and personal sufferings of women, which further promotes the occurrence and development of incidents that infringe upon women's human rights.

Judging from the self-criticism of the Shexian County Party Committee and the speeches of the Fourth Prefectural Committee of Beiyue, there is also a common ideological problem, that is, many cadres (even quite important leading cadres) believe that implementing autonomous marriage and equal rights for men and women is detrimental to poor farmers; if it is resolutely implemented, it will alienate poor farmers. As a result, the government does not seriously resolve the issue of many farmers' families beating and maltreating their wives and daughters-in-law; many young girls are casually promised to others by their parents, and the girls are not allowed to dissolve the marriage contract; many obviously unreasonable marriages are not allowed to dissolve, and even to take care of the farmers in their own village, women are not allowed to find men from other villages, implementing "control," to the point where women are forced to commit suicide, and they still do not resolutely correct it. They say: "The implementation of marriage laws should take into account the environment; resolute implementation will lead to chaos."

Taking care of poor farmers is right and proper; the Outline Land Law promulgated by our party is to distribute land and other means of production to poor farmers. But to regard women as land property to "take care of" poor farmers is a thoroughly feudal and reactionary idea. It must be recognized that to win the victory of the Liberation War and implement various social reforms, it is not possible to succeed without mobilizing women, who account for half of the population. And this "care" theory regards women as land property, not as human beings, not as objects of mobilization and revolutionary forces. How can this be beneficial to the cause of people's liberation?

Taking care of the environment is also right; but it should not be forgotten that more important is to transform the environment! The farmers' demand to overthrow the feudal landlord rule is revolutionary and should be actively supported and led to its complete realization; but some people demand not to mobilize women, not to implement equal rights for men and women, and autonomous marriage. This should not be blindly accommodated and become a tail. The result of accommodation can only be to delay the progress of society, retain feudal family relations, shut the broad masses of women out of the door of revolution, and abandon them in the abyss of darkness. If divorce means "chaos," then isn't it even more terrifying to force women to commit suicide? In fact, true implementation of autonomous marriage will reduce divorce.

We hope that the leading organs in various places will learn from the Shexian County Party Committee, thoroughly examine and eradicate all remaining feudal and backward ideas! We hope that the leading organs in various places will educate all cadres to eradicate this kind of thinking! Through cadres, conduct New Democratic education among the broad masses of farmers, and conduct education on autonomous marriage and equal rights for men and women, so that they understand: mobilizing women is of great significance to production, construction, and support for the Liberation War; and it is also of great significance to their own liberation. Any behavior that infringes upon women's legitimate rights, beats and abuses women should be solemnly stated as illegal and subject to legal sanctions. Some areas have already begun to sanction such illegal behavior by law, which is completely correct. General family disputes and marriage disputes should be mediated as much as possible; if mediation is impossible, they must be handled in accordance with laws and decrees. A bureaucratic attitude of procrastination should not be adopted, and illegal suppression of women should not be carried out. Everything should be analyzed and resolved from the perspective of the party's policies and class viewpoint.

### 保障妇女合法权利

专栏：短论

　　保障妇女合法权利
    从今天发表的几条消息看，妇女的婚姻自主权以至人权、财权没有充分保障，遭受无理打骂虐待的事情，在我区还不是个别的现象，这应引起我们严重的注意。在封建剥削制度已经消灭了的华北解放区，为什么有些地区还会存在这些封建性的极端不合理的现象呢？这也并不奇怪，因为，中国人民（不论男女）长期受着封建的压迫，封建思想给予人民的束缚最为厉害，因此，虽然在解放区妇女已得到解放，她们在政治上、经济上、社会和家庭中的地位已有根本的改变；她们在解放战争、土地改革运动、生产运动中，表现其伟大的作用，但要使全体人民都一下消灭了这种封建思想的残余，和废除了一切束缚妇女的封建习俗，还是一个较长期的思想教育过程。特别是由于各个地区解放有迟早、工作基础有强弱，这就更形成今天在某些地区还有侵犯妇女人权现象的社会原因。正因为如此，这种由旧社会遗留下来的重男轻女观念，和各样封建习俗的束缚，不但在一般男女群众中或多或少地存在着，而且在部分干部中残留着，这就表现在对待处理妇女问题上，还缺乏正确观点与正确态度，不是用马列主义、毛泽东思想指导工作，而是片面地强调男子方面的利益，而对妇女的特殊利益与切身痛苦，完全漠视，更促成了侵犯妇女人权事件的发生和发展。
    从涉县县委的检讨与北岳四地委的发言中看，还有一个共同的思想问题，这就是许多干部（甚至相当重要的领导干部）认为：实行婚姻自主与男女平权，对贫苦农民是不利的；如果坚决实行，那就会脱离贫苦农民。这样，有许多农民家庭打骂虐待妻子与媳妇，政府不认真解决；有许多少女被父母随便许给别人，不允许少女解除婚约；有许多显然不合理的婚姻，不允许离散，甚至为照顾本村农民，不允许妇女找外村男人，实行“统制”，以至逼得妇女自杀，仍不坚决纠正。他们说：“执行婚姻法令要照顾环境；坚决执行，就会天下大乱。”
    照顾贫农是应该的，我党颁布的土地法大纲，就是要分给贫农土地与其他生产资料。但把妇女也看成土地财产一样，以之去“照顾”贫农，那就是十足的封建的反动的思想。必须认识，要争取解放战争的胜利与各种社会改革的贯彻实行，不发动占人口半数的妇女是不成功的。而这种“照顾”论却是把妇女看成了土地财产，而不当做人，不当做发动的对象与革命的力量，这对人民解放事业难道会有什么好处么？
    照顾环境也是对的；但不应忘记：更重要的是改造环境！农民要求推翻封建地主统治，这是革命的，应该积极拥护与领导其彻底实现的；但有些人要求不发动妇女，不实行男女平等、婚姻自主，这就不应一味迁就，当尾巴。迁就的结果，只能是把社会的前进迟滞起来，保留封建的家庭关系，把广大妇女关到革命的门外，弃在黑暗的深渊。如果说离婚就是“天下大乱”的话，那么，逼得妇女自杀，这不更乱得可怕吗？事实上，真正实行了婚姻自主，离婚倒是会减少的。
    我们希望各地领导机关学习涉县县委，彻底检查与根除一切残存的封建落后思想！希望各地领导机关教育所有干部根除这种思想！经过干部，对广大农民群众进行新民主主义的教育，进行婚姻自主与男女平权的教育，使他们了解：发动了妇女，对生产、建设、支援解放战争都有伟大的意义；也就是对他们自己的解放有着伟大的意义。对一切侵犯妇女合法权利、打骂虐待妇女的行为，应当郑重说明它是违法行为，是要受到法律制裁的。有的地区已经开始以法律制裁这种违法行为，这是完全正确的。一般家庭纠纷与婚姻纠纷，能够教育调解的，自然应当尽量调解；如果无论如何也不能调解，则必须依照法令处理。不能采取官僚主义的拖延态度，更不能对妇女施行非法的压制。一切应从党的政策与阶级观点出发来分析与解决问题。
