　　The news we publish today about the cotton price turmoil in Linqing is a serious warning sign for our entire state-owned trade work. Although this incident occurred more than two months ago, the lessons it leaves us have certainly not passed. For example, the recent rise in grain prices in some areas close to the front lines can be said to be a repetition of the Linqing incident to some extent. The fundamental lesson we should learn from the Linqing incident can be expressed in Lenin's words: "Compared with capitalists, you have an advantage because state power is in your hands, but you are not good at using them." (Political Report of the Central Committee at the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party, March 1922) Lenin's words are directed at all our state-owned economies today that are not good at leading the market, controlling prices, and leading private capital. To review the Linqing incident, there is no doubt that we should also look for it in the direction pointed out by Lenin.
　　To talk about the current trade work from the Linqing incident, we must look back at the past. We know that the state-owned trade work of the Liberated Area People's Government since the Anti-Japanese War has been successful, which is mainly reflected in the following two aspects: First, in the economic struggle against the enemy. Although the degree of difference existed in various liberated areas, significant achievements have been made in excluding enemy and puppet goods, protecting and developing indigenous production, and striving for necessary foreign military supplies. Second, the supply and demand of materials within the liberated areas has been adjusted to a certain extent, and the prices within the liberated areas have been relatively stabilized. But along with these achievements, there are also serious principal shortcomings in the state-owned trade work. To put it simply, there are more financial achievements than economic achievements. That is to say, the state-owned trade is completely unsatisfactory in how to lead and control private merchants, how to stabilize the market, oppose speculation; how to protect the interests of small producers and consumers; how to assist in establishing a system of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives to connect small production and to plan the distribution of materials needed for industrial production and people's consumption, etc.
　　Based on such an unsound trade work, of course, the occurrence of the Linqing incident and similar incidents is not accidental. This is because: First, some of our state-owned trade organs have not clearly recognized their major responsibility for leading the market for a considerable period of time, and have abandoned their responsibility. They have not deeply understood the harm of drastic market fluctuations to the entire national economy. Second, they have insufficient understanding of the nature of commercial capital, especially the destructive nature of its speculative activities. In the Linqing incident, they did not seriously prevent or try to stop the speculative activities of private commercial capital, and eventually promoted and helped them to carry out speculative and destructive activities. Third, many state-owned trade workers still do not understand commerce very well, and do not understand the laws of economic activity and market development. Therefore, in the Linqing incident, the steps taken by many trade workers were full of all kinds of blind and reckless mistakes. They were so reckless that they simply did not estimate what serious changes would occur in market supply and demand and prices due to their many blind and reckless activities, and what serious consequences this change would have for millions of people and the people's government. Fourth, and most importantly, this incident is the inevitable result of the long-term existence of independent economic work, the absence of centralized and unified leadership, and a state of anarchy and indiscipline. If the two regions had completely unified steps and did not compete with each other for purchases, the Linqing incident could have been completely avoided. All this tells us that although the state-owned trade organs of a new democratic country possess all the necessary conditions, such as abundant capital, convenient state credit, priority transportation conditions, and well-informed commercial information, if they do not have or do not implement correct policies, that is, "are not good at using them," they still cannot achieve the purpose of state-owned trade, and will eventually be defeated by private capitalism and ruin the future of the new democratic economy. Naturally, it is impossible to over-blame our economic workers for events like Linqing happening today; they may not have acted out of malice at all. Because our party has not seriously educated them so that they clearly understand the new democratic economic policy. The People's Government has not yet formulated complete economic laws for them to follow. Most of the mistakes they have made are still blind. Therefore, it is very important to educate our economic workers with these events at present, otherwise, we will not be able to deal with the new situation in the future.
　　We must understand that the new situation after the nationwide victory greatly increases the possibility of events that are ten or a hundred times more dangerous than the Linqing incident. Because, first of all, in these liberated and soon-to-be-liberated big cities, there exists a huge commercial capital that we have never faced before, which has been engaged in speculative activities for a long time under the rule of the Kuomintang. At that time, the main role in destroying the national economy was of course not them, but the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, but after the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital has been overthrown, the situation has changed. If the new democratic state economy cannot control them, then they will become the main factor in destroying the national economy in the future. Secondly, what we have been and will be facing is the centralized living consumption, raw material consumption, and the distribution of concentrated production products in big cities. These must rely on complex and large-scale commercial activities. Therefore, the responsibility of state-owned trade work at present and in the future is greatly increased.
　　How can state-owned trade work shoulder its huge and important tasks in the future? How can we avoid or make fewer mistakes like the Linqing incident?
　　First of all, all state-owned economic workers must establish a correct understanding of private commercial capital before we can talk about the correct policies towards private commercial capital. It must be known that under the conditions that state-owned and cooperative commerce are unable to completely replace private commercial capital, the existence of private commerce is inevitable and indispensable. However, every private commercial activity cannot but be intermediate exploitation of producers and consumers at the same time, and every commercial capitalist cannot but seize the opportunity to speculate every hour. And once the gap for speculation expands, for example, when the circulation of materials is hindered due to war, certain materials are particularly scarce, the currency system is not unified and changes, prices fluctuate, etc., then every "legitimate" businessman will carry out speculative activities. At this time, private commercial capital becomes a destructive factor in the national economy (if state-owned commerce also does this, it is also a destructive factor, and the harm is even greater). The private commercial capital in the Linqing incident was very obvious: they exploited both producers and consumers, and also exploited the national treasury, and caused prices in both regions to rise.
　　Of course, pointing out the possible harm of private commercial capital does not mean that we do not want the policy of protecting industry and commerce. No, we must still resolutely implement the following policies to protect and develop industry and commerce, namely: 1. Protecting industrial and commercial property from illegal infringement, and strictly maintaining the distinction between the feudal property of feudal landlords and industrial and commercial property; 2. The labor-capital mutual benefit policy of the workers' movement; 3. Tax policies that are conducive to the development of industry and commerce. However, after these policies are firmly implemented, what are the main dangers that may occur at that time? There is no doubt that the main danger that may occur at that time is not a "leftist" danger but a rightist danger. "Correcting the 'left' must prevent the right" - this slogan at the end of the rural land reform is also completely applicable to the current policy towards industry and commerce. Therefore, our correct attitude towards private commercial capital must not be a completely laissez-faire attitude, but should be to lead, manage and control them, so that they cannot carry out destructive speculative activities, and embark on a path that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.
　　Second, it is necessary to thoroughly understand and shoulder the task of state-owned trade. The task of state-owned trade is to wage a clever struggle with speculative private commercial capital through market relations (administrative orders can only help this struggle), to prevent the possibility of market speculation; to protect the interests of producers, consumers and the national economy, and to treat them with correct pricing policies that are beneficial to production; to carry out rigorous investigation and statistical work, to acquire and distribute social materials in a planned manner, and to meet the correct needs of social public and private production and consumption; to organize small producers around themselves through the system of supply and marketing cooperatives, so as to lead small production, etc. In short, it is to establish, consolidate and develop the leading role of the state-owned economy in the new democratic economic system. But to achieve this goal, the new democratic state organs and state-owned economic system must earnestly do the following important tasks:
　　A. The state-owned trade system must have centralized and unified leadership, so as to establish unified acquisition and sales agencies, unified acquisition and sales plans, unified acquisition and sales pricing policies, etc. No state-owned economic organs are allowed to compete with each other in the market at different prices, or even to unite with private merchants to compete. In particular, it is not allowed to compete in neighboring regions. Of course, these tasks should take various necessary measures at present to make them as fast as possible and step by step. First of all, such centralized and unified leadership should and can be quickly established within each strategic zone. Between the various strategic zones, if it cannot be achieved for a while, it should also be consulted with each other at any time to achieve consistent steps. The major mistake in the Linqing incident, in which the two regions of North China and East China competed with each other in their own way, to the point where they had to resort to private speculative capital, is not allowed to continue under any circumstances. Only in this way can the state-owned trade organs help the development of the entire national economy, and will not be flustered in the face of the speculative frenzy of private merchants, and can show their combat effectiveness when fighting against the speculative and destructive nature of private commercial capital.
　　B. The state-owned trade system should establish scientific investigation and statistical work, that is to say, it should gradually make detailed investigations and statistics on the supply capacity and needs of the market in this region and outside regions, including the needs of people's living consumption and the supply capacity and needs of public and private production. This is the fundamental issue of eliminating blindness in work. Only after mastering these most important investigation and statistical materials can state-owned trade organs formulate unified acquisition and sales plans, can they adjust supply and demand, and can they plan to distribute materials to various regions, various consumers, and various production departments (of course, such arduous work cannot be done by the trade department alone). In this way, not only is the possible planning of the new democratic economy realized, but also the necessary preparation work is done for the production and distribution of the future socialist economy. This is what we must achieve in long-term efforts.
　　C. The Linqing incident also tells us that the state-owned economy has no possibility of directly purchasing the products that small scattered producers need to exchange from them, and it is also impossible to universally distribute the products in its hands to them. That is to say, there is still a lack of a necessary intermediate bridge or connection between the state-owned economy and small production, so it cannot organize and lead small producers, but allows private capitalism to contact small producers, so that small producers can only sell their products and obtain supplies through private capitalist commerce instead of through state-owned commerce. In this way, small producers have to be subjected to the intermediate exploitation of private capitalism, and have to attach themselves to the system of the capitalist economy. If the development of this situation is not replaced by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce led by the proletariat on a large scale, the result will inevitably run counter to the development direction of new democracy. This problem can only be solved after a system of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives is established between the state-owned economy and small producers, and therefore, that is to say, a connection is established between the state-owned economy and small producers and consumers. These supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives are organized by producers and consumers themselves with the help of the state economy. Their purpose is to supply small producers with the necessities of life and production at the lowest possible price, and to acquire the products of small producers at the fairest possible price, so that small producers are gradually not subject to the intermediate exploitation of speculators; they are agents of the state-owned economy for purchasing materials and raw materials, and promoting finished products, so that small producers are led by the state-owned economy through the medium of supply and marketing cooperatives. Through these methods, small production is gradually organized, and the inherent spontaneity, blindness, dispersion, and anarchy of small production are gradually overcome; at the same time, the state economy also obtains a reliable assistant to carry out the above-mentioned statistical, supervisory, and planned distribution work.
　　Third, the Linqing incident shows that some of our comrades have not fully learned or have simply not learned how to do economic work, especially how to do commercial work that is regarded as "vulgar" and "indecent." However, commerce has a very important significance in the struggle (or competition) between socialist economic components (the state-owned economy under new democracy is such a component) and capitalist economic components. The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in summarizing the experience of the Soviet Union in the early days of the New Economic Policy in 1921-1922 (that is, the period when socialist economic components and capitalist economic components coexisted and struggled), said: "The New Economic Policy is a life-and-death struggle between capitalism and socialism. The question is, 'Who will defeat whom?' In order to win, it is necessary to ensure the combination between the working class and the peasants, and between socialist industry and the peasant economy, by maximizing the development of commodity circulation between urban and rural areas. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to learn how to manage the economy and how to do business in a civilized manner.
　　"During this period, commerce was the basic link in the chain of tasks facing the Party. Without solving this task, it would be impossible to expand the commodity circulation between urban and rural areas, to consolidate the economic alliance between workers and peasants, and to improve agriculture and bring industry out of destruction.
　　"At that time, Soviet commerce was still very weak. Communists had not yet had the habit of doing business, had not yet been familiar with the enemy - the NEPmen (private capitalists, merchants, and speculators in the first period of the New Economic Policy - translator's note), and had not yet learned how to fight them. Private merchants, the NEPmen, took advantage of the weakness of Soviet commerce and took over the trade of cloth and other daily commodities. The issue of organizing state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce has great significance." (Chapter 9, Section 3 of the book)
　　Therefore, Lenin emphasized countless times at that time that Communists should learn how to manage the economy and learn how to do business. He said: "In the past, capitalists knew how to handle supplies. Although they did this very improperly, bullying us in a robber-like way and plundering us... But you - try to do it according to the new method: you have no profits to gain, the principles are communist, and the ideals are excellent - you holy people, you can simply ascend to heaven alive - but will things be done after all?" Lenin said: "Please look at what we must do in the economic field: now we must compete with ordinary shop assistants, ordinary capitalists, and merchants... We must pay full attention to this, and do not be complacent and comforted by the fact that there are responsible and excellent Communists everywhere in the state trusts and joint-stock companies - this is of no benefit, because they are not good at business, and are worse than the ordinary capitalist shop assistants who have been trained in large factories and large businesses. We have not realized this. To use the same beautiful Russian words, there is still 'communist exaggeration'." Lenin said: "We have proved very clearly in this year that we cannot manage business. This is the main lesson. Either we prove in the next year that we can manage business, or the Soviet regime cannot continue to exist. The greatest danger is that not everyone realizes this. If all Communists and responsible workers understand that since they cannot, they must learn from scratch, then we will win - in my opinion, this is the main and fundamental conclusion." (March 1922, Political Report of the Central Committee at the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party)
　　Of course, the political and economic environment and the policies that the Chinese people should take today are different from when Lenin said these words, as mentioned above. But this "fundamental conclusion" that Lenin put forward to the Russian Communists has great educational significance for the Chinese Communists and the Chinese working people today. If we want to avoid "communist exaggeration," we must "learn from scratch" and fully learn how to do economic work well. Facts have proved that we are fully capable of doing economic work well. As long as we are good at learning, we will surely achieve great victories like in the military field.
　　Linqing Incident Process:
　　The Linqing city occurred in the two liberated areas of the state-owned trade organs violating the new democratic economic policy of the scramble for incidents, the details of which have been published in the second edition of this newspaper on December 8. The process of the incident is now published as follows:
　　[Xinhua News Agency, North China, 17th] In October last year, a scramble for 1.5 million catties of cotton linters occurred in Linqing City (located at the confluence of the Grand Canal and the Weihe River in northwestern Shandong) in the North China Liberated Area by state-owned trade organs of the North China and East China Liberated Areas, which stimulated price increases and encouraged private merchants to speculate, thus causing a serious violation of the new democratic economic policy. Involved in this whirlpool were more than 20 state-owned trade organs stationed in the city in the North China Liberated Area, Huamao Company, and trade organizations and other organs opened by Jizhong, Jinan, Jilu Yu, and Bohai, Jiaodong, and other administrative regions in East China. Due to the scramble for purchases, the price of cotton soared by 57% in the 18 days from October 9 to 26, which caused a surge in general prices. During this period, the above-mentioned trade organs purchased a total of 1.5 million catties of cotton linters. In addition to purchasing themselves, they also entrusted private merchants to purchase on their behalf. After buying out the cotton in Linqing City, they went to nearby towns and villages to scramble for purchases. The private merchants bought and sold short, adulterated the cotton, and took the opportunity to profit from the public. For example, Taixinglong, a trade organization in the Jilu Yu region, entrusted Wuhe and other two flower shops to purchase on their behalf, and Wuhe and other two flower shops in turn entrusted Hengman and other three flower shops to purchase on their behalf, and Hengman and other flower shops in turn entrusted Longtai flower shop to purchase on their behalf, thus enabling speculative private merchants to exploit the national treasury and small producers at every level. Due to reckless purchases, the quality of cotton was greatly reduced. The cotton purchased by Defengyu, a trade organ in the Jilu Yu region, from the Wanjuda flower shop could squeeze out water when it was packed. According to the lowest estimate, if 10 catties of moisture were added to every 100 catties of cotton, then the various trade organs purchased a total of 150,000 catties of moisture in this scramble, calculated at 2.035 yuan per catty before the cotton price fluctuation, the national treasury lost a total of more than 300.5 million Jinnan currency.
　　The course of this incident was: After Jinan was liberated, the flow of materials between the North China and East China regions was smooth, but prices in the East China region were higher, and the price difference between cotton and cloth was even greater. For example, based on the Linqing cotton price on October 11, Jinan was 22% higher, Yidu was 50% higher, and Weixian was 81% higher. In addition, the equivalent circulation of currency between the two regions in mid-October would inevitably cause merchants in the East China region to flock to Linqing to purchase cotton in large quantities. However, at this time, the state-owned trade organs in the two regions not only did not take the necessary measures to adjust the materials in the two regions and stabilize prices, but also followed the private merchants to compete with each other for purchases, each acting on its own, and absorbing large quantities without a plan or leadership, which caused cotton prices to rise sharply. Seeing that cotton prices had risen so sharply, Huamao Company stopped buying, attempting to stabilize prices with its "attitude" of not buying, but the remaining 20 or so state-owned stores and organ stores were scrambling for purchases, so prices continued to rise, private merchants continued to engage in fraud, and the market fell into extreme chaos. Seeing this situation, the local Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the state-owned Huamao Company convened a meeting of all state-owned trade organs in the city on October 14, and decided to jointly stop purchasing (this decision was also incorrect, as it gave up the position and allowed private merchants to speculate freely), but the next day, Huamao Company took the lead in continuing to scramble for purchases, eventually causing the above-mentioned phenomena of soaring cotton prices and general prices and reduced quality. During this period, the various trade organs not only violated policies, but also showed a serious lack of government and discipline. For example, Taixinglong in Jilu Yu did not obtain the task of purchasing cotton from the government of the administrative region, but privately bought 170,000 to 80,000 catties for the sole purpose of transporting them to Jinan to make money. These companies obtained an order from the North China government on October 20, which stipulated that "state-owned stores in each region are not allowed to directly purchase cotton in Linqing City. If there is a need, the local state-owned stores can purchase on their behalf," but they still tried to continue purchasing by various means, such as the Jianhua Branch of Jinan purchased as many as 500,000 catties of cotton after learning of this order, which eventually caused the above-mentioned dangerous phenomena in the market.

### 临清事件与国营商业

专栏：新华社社论

　　临清事件与国营商业
    今天我们所发表的关于临清棉价风潮的新闻，对于我们的整个国营贸易工作是一个严重的警号。这件事虽然已经过去了两个多月，但它留给我们的教训却决没有过去。例如最近某些接近前线地区粮价的上涨，就可说是临清事件的某种程度内的重复。我们在临清事件中所应该得到的根本教训，可以用列宁这段话来表示：“与资本家比较起来，你是占着优势，因为国家政权在你的手中，只是你不善于运用它们。”（俄国共产党第十一次代表大会上中央委员会底政治报告，一九二二年三月）列宁的这段话，正象对准我们今天一切不善于领导市场、掌握物价，不善于领导私人资本的国营经济而发的一样。要检讨临清事件，毫无疑义也应当从列宁指出的这个方向去寻找。
    要从临清事件来谈目前的贸易工作，就不能不回溯一下过去的情形。我们知道，抗日战争以来的解放区人民政府的国营贸易工作是有成绩的，这主要表现在以下两方面：首先，是在对敌经济斗争方面。各解放区虽然程度不同，但在排除敌伪商品，保护与发展土著生产，争取必需的外来军用物资等工作上，是有重要成绩的。其次，是在一定程度上调剂了解放区内物资的供需，相对地稳定了解放区内的物价。但与这些成绩同时，国营贸易工作中还存在着严重的原则性的缺点。简单的说就是：财政成绩多，经济成绩少。即是说，国营贸易在如何领导与控制私商，如何稳定市场，反对投机；如何保护小生产群众与消费群众的利益；如何协助建立供销合作社与消费合作社的系统来联系小生产及有计划地分配为工业生产与人民消费所需要的物资等等方面，是做得完全不能令人满意的。
    在这样不甚健全的贸易工作基础上，当然临清事件以及类似临清事件的发生就不是偶然的了。这是由于：第一，我们的有些国营贸易机关相当长期地没有明确认识自己领导市场的重大责任，并放弃了自己的责任，没有深刻了解，市场的剧烈波动对于整个国民经济的危害性。第二，它们对商业资本的本质特别是它的投机活动的破坏性也认识不足。在临清事件中，它们对私人商业资本的投机活动既未认真防范，也未设法制止，终至推动并帮助它们进行了投机破坏活动。第三，是不少的国营贸易工作人员还很不懂得商业，很不懂得经济活动和市场发展的规律。因此，在临清事件中，许多贸易工作人员所采取的步骤，就充满了各式各样的盲目的和鲁莽的错误。他们是如此轻率，以至简直没有估计到，由于他们的许多盲目的鲁莽的活动，市场供求和物价将要发生什么严重的变动，以及这个变动对于千百万人民和人民的政府将要产生什么严重的结果。第四，尤其主要的，这次事件是经济工作中长期存在的各自为政，无集中统一领导，无政府无纪律状态必然要产生的恶果。如果两区步调完全统一，不要互相抢购，则临清事件是完全可以避免的。所有这些就告诉了我们：虽然新民主主义国家的国营贸易机关，拥有一切必要的条件，如雄厚的资本，便利的国家信贷，优先的交通条件，灵通的商业情报等，但是如果没有或不执行正确的政策，即“不善于运用它们”时，仍然不能达到国营贸易的目的，终至会被私人资本主义打败，并断送新民主主义经济的前途的。自然，在今天发生临清这类事件，是不能过重地责备我们那些经济工作人员的，他们那样作，可能完全不是从恶意出发。因为我们的党还没有认真地教育他们，使他们明确地懂得新民主主义的经济政策。人民政府也还没有规定完备的经济法令，使他们有所遵循。他们所犯的错误，大多数还是带盲目性的。所以拿这些事件来教育我们的经济工作人员，在目前十分重要，否则，我们就将完全不能对付今后的新的情况。
    我们必须明白，全国胜利后的新情况，使产生比临清事件危险十百倍事件的可能性，是大大地增加了。因为，首先，在这些已经解放及即将解放的大城市中，存在着我们从未面对过的庞大的商业资本，它们在国民党统治下曾长期从事于投机活动。那时，扮演破坏国民经济主要角色的，当然不是它们而是国民党官僚资本，但在国民党官僚资本既经打倒之后，情形就变化了。如果新民主主义的国家经济对它们不能加以控制，那么，它们便将成为今后破坏国民经济的主要因素。其次，是我们已经和即将面对着的，是大城市的集中的生活消费、原料消耗、与集中的生产品的分配。这些都必须依靠繁复的大规模的商业活动。因此，目前及今后国营贸易工作的责任是非常巨大地增加了。
    国营贸易工作今后要怎样才能担负起它的巨大而且重要的任务呢？怎样才能不犯或者少犯象临清事件一类的错误呢？
    首先，是要一切国营经济工作者树立起对于私人商业资本的正确认识，然后才能谈到对私人商业资本的正确政策。须知，在国营及合作社商业还无力完全来代替私人商业资本的条件之下，私人商业的存在是必然的也是不可少的。但每一次私人商业活动同时不能不是对生产者和消费者的中间剥削，每一个商业资本家不能不在每一小时伺隙投机。而在一当可供投机的空隙扩大，例如，因战争而使物资流通受到阻碍，某些物资特别缺乏，币制的不统一和变动，物价发生波动等等的时候，那时每一个“正当”商人，就都会去进行投机活动。这时候的私人商业资本就变成了国民经济中的破坏因素（国营商业如果也照这样做，也是一样的破坏因素，而且为害更烈）。临清事件中的私人商业资本就表现的非常明显：它们既剥削了生产者，又剥削了消费者，也剥削了国家的国库，并使得两区物价均形上涨。
    当然，指出私人商业资本可能的危害性，并不是说我们不要保护工商业的政策了，不是的，我们仍然要坚决的执行下面这些保护与发展工商业的政策，即：一，保护工商业财产不受非法侵犯，严格保持对封建地主的封建财产与对工商业财产的区分；二，劳资两利的职工运动方针；三，有利于发展工商业的税收政策。但是，在坚决执行了这些政策之后，那时候可能发生的主要危险是什么呢？毫无疑义的，那时候可能发生的主要危险便不是“左倾”危险而是右倾危险了。“纠左必须防右”——结束农村土地改革中的这一句口号，在目前对待工商业的政策中也是完全适用的。因此，我们对于私人商业资本的正确态度，便决不能采取完全放任自流的态度，而应当是领导、管理和控制它们，使它们无法进行破坏性的投机活动，并走上有利于国计民生的道路。
    第二，就是要彻底弄清楚并担负起国营贸易的任务。国营贸易的任务，是要和投机性的私人商业资本经过市场关系来作巧妙的斗争（行政命令只能帮助这种斗争），阻遏市场投机的可能性；是要保护生产者、消费者和国家经济的利益，以正确的有利于生产的价格政策来对待它们；是要进行严密的调查、统计工作，有计划地收购与分配社会物资，满足社会公私生产和消费的正确需要；是要把小生产者经过供销合作社的系统组织在自己的周围，以领导小生产等等。简言之，就是要建立、巩固和发展新民主主义经济体系中国营经济的领导作用。但要达到这个目的，新民主主义的国家机关及国营经济系统就必须认真的做到以下的几项重要工作：
    甲、国营贸易系统，必须要有集中统一的领导，以便建立统一的收购和售出机关，统一的收购和售出计划，统一的收购和售出的价格政策等等。不许各个国营经济机关以不同价格到市场上去互相竞争，甚至联合私商去竞争。尤其不许到邻区去竞争。当然，这些工作在目前应采取种种必要办法，使其尽速而又是有步骤地作到。首先在各个战略区内部应当而且可能很快建立这种集中统一的领导。在各个战略区之间，如一时还不能作到，也应随时互相协商，作到步调一致。象此次临清事件中华北、华东两区各自为政地互相竞争，以至不得不求助于私人投机资本的重大错误，是无论如何不许继续存在的。只有这样，国营贸易机关，才有可能对整个国民经济的发展有所帮助，才不至在私商的投机狂潮前惊惶失措，才能够在和私人商业资本的投机性、破坏性作斗争时，表现自己的战斗力。
    乙、国营贸易系统，应建立起科学的调查统计工作，就是说，应该对于本区和外区市场的供给能力和需要状况，包括人民生活消费品的需要状况及公私生产的供给能力与需要状况，逐步地作出周密的调查统计。这是消灭工作中的盲目性的根本问题。只有在掌握了这些最重要的调查统计材料之后，国营贸易机关才有可能定出统一的收购和售出计划，才有可能调剂供求，才有可能有计划地分配物资于各个地区，各个消费者和各个生产部门（当然，这样繁重的工作，不能单靠贸易机关一个部门去作）。这样，就不仅实现了新民主主义经济的可能的计划性，而且为将来社会主义经济的生产和分配作了必要的准备工作。这是我们必须在长期努力中作到的。
    丙、临清事件还告诉我们，国营经济没有可能直接从散漫的小生产者手中购得其需要拿出来进行交换的生产品，同样也没有可能把自己手中的生产品普遍地分配给他们。这就是说，在国营经济与小生产之间还缺乏一种必要的中间桥梁或联系，因此也就不能组织和领导小生产者，而让私人资本主义去和小生产者发生了联系，使小生产者不是经过国营商业而是经过私人资本主义商业才得出售其生产品与获得供给品。这样，就使小生产者不得不受私人资本主义的中间剥削，不得不把自己附属于资本主义经济的体系内，如果这个情况的发展不被无产阶级领导的国营商业和合作社商业在广大范围内所代替，其结果必然是与新民主主义的发展方向背道而驰。这个问题，只有在国营经济与小生产者之间建立起了供销合作社与消费合作社的系统，因而也就是说建立起了国营经济与小生产者及消费者之间的联系以后才能解决。这种供销合作社与消费合作社是在国家经济的帮助之下，由生产者和消费者自己组织起来的，其目的在于以尽可能低廉的价格供给小生产者以生活上和生产上的必需品，尽可能公道的价格收购小生产者的生产品，使小生产者逐渐不受投机商人的中间剥削；是代国营经济收购物资原料，及推销成品，使小生产者经过供销合作社的媒介而受国营经济的领导。经过这些办法，逐渐地把小生产组织起来，逐渐地克服小生产固有的自发性、盲目性、散漫性与无政府性；同时也使国家经济得到一个可靠的助手，来进行上述的统计、监督和有计划的分配工作。
    第三，临清事件说明，我们一部分同志还没有完全学会或者简直没有学会如何做经济工作，特别是如何做被人目为“市俗的”、“不体面的”的商业工作。而商业在社会主义经济成份（新民主主义下的国营经济便是这种成份）与资本主义经济成份的斗争（或叫竞赛）中，却有非常重大的意义。联共党史在总结苏联一九二一——一九二二年新经济政策初期（也就是社会主义经济成份与资本主义经济成份同时并存而又进行斗争的时期）的经验时说：“新经济政策就是资本主义与社会主义间的生死的斗争。“谁战胜谁”——问题就是这样摆着的。为要胜利，就必须经过尽量发展城乡间的商品流转而来保证工人阶级与农民之间的，社会主义工业与农民经济之间的结合。为要做到这一步，就必须学会管理经济，必须学会文明经商。
    “在这个时期中，商业是摆在党前面的诸任务的链条中的基本环节。不解决这个任务，就不能扩展城乡间的商品流转，就不能巩固工农底经济联盟，就不能提高农业和使工业走出破坏状态。
    “当时，苏维埃商业还是很薄弱的，共产党员还没有经商的习惯，还没有熟知敌人——耐普曼（新经济政策第一时期中的私资企业家、商人、投机贩子——译者注），还没有学会如何和他们斗争。私资商人，耐普曼，曾利用苏维埃商业底弱点，而把布匹以及其他日用商品底贸易，抓到自己手中。关于组织国家商业和合作社商业的问题，就具有巨大的意义。”（该书第九章第三节）
    因此，列宁在当时曾无数次地强调共产党员要学会管理经济，学会经营商业，他说：“以前资本家会办理供给。虽然这件事情他们做得很不正当，用强盗的方式欺负了我们，掠夺了我们。……可是你们——试按照新方法去作吧：你们既无利润可获，原则是共产主义的，理想是再好不过的，——你们这些神圣人物，简直可以活活地升入天堂里去，——但事情究竟会不会作呢？”列宁说：“请看在经济方面我们必需要作的事吧：现在就是要赛得过平常的店员，普通的资本家，商人………我们要用全力注意到这点，不要以为在国家托拉斯和合股公司中，到处都是负责的优秀共产党员而自安自慰——这没有任何益处，因为他们不善于经营，比较那班经过大工厂大商号锻炼的普通资本主义店员要差一些。这点我们没有觉悟到，这里要用同样美丽的俄文词句说来，就是还存在有‘共产主义的夸大狂’。”列宁说：“我们在这一年来极明显地证明了，我们不会管理业务。这是主要的教训。或者我们在最近这一年内证明我们会管理业务，或者是苏维埃政权不能继续存在下去。最大的危险就是并非所有的人都意识到这点。如果全体共产党员，负责工作人员，都明白了解到：自己既然不会，就得从头学习，那时我们便会获得胜利，——据我的意见，这才是主要的，根本的结论。”（一九二二年三月，俄国共产党第十一次代表大会上中央委员会底政治报告）
    当然，中国人民今天所处的政治经济环境和应当采取的政策，如前所说，是与列宁说这些话的时候不相同的。但是列宁向俄国共产党员提出的这个“根本的结论”，对于今天的中国共产党员和中国的劳动人民说来，却有伟大的教育意义。我们要想避免“共产主义的夸大狂”，就得“从头学起”，完全学会做好经济工作。事实已经证明了我们是完全能够把经济工作做得很好的，只要我们善于学习，我们就一定会得到象在军事方面一样伟大的胜利。
    临清事件经过：
    临清市发生两解放区国营贸易机关违反新民主主义经济政策的抢购事件，其详情已载本报十二月八日第二版。兹再将事件经过刊载如下：
    【新华社华北十七日电】去年十月，华北解放区临清市（位于鲁西北运河与卫河汇合处）发生华北、华东两解放区的国营贸易机关抢购棉绒一百五十万斤，刺激物价上涨，鼓励私商投机，因而造成严重违反新民主主义经济政策的事件。卷入这一漩涡中的，有驻在该市的华北解放区的国营贸易机关华茂公司，及冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫、与华东的渤海、胶东等行政区的贸易机构以及其他机关开设的公营商店等共廿余家。由于抢购，从十月九日到廿六日的十八天内，棉花价格暴涨百分之五十七，并因而引起了一般物价的暴涨。在此期间，上述贸易机关共抢购了一百五十万斤棉绒。他们除自购外，并委托私商代购，把临清市上的存棉买光之后，又到附近城镇与乡村抢购。私商们则买空卖空，搀假使潮，一齐向公家渔利。如冀鲁豫区贸易机构泰兴隆委托五和等两花店代购，五和等两花店又转托恒满等三花店代购，恒满等花店又委托隆泰花店代购，这样，使投机私商得以层层剥削国库和小生产者。由于不顾一切的抢购，又使棉花质量大为降低。冀鲁豫贸易机关德丰裕从私商万聚大花店购入的棉花，打包时竟能压出水来。据最低估计，每百斤棉花中若使潮十斤，则此次抢购中各贸易机关共买入水分十五万斤，依棉价波动前之每斤二、○三五元计算，国库共损失冀南币三万万零五百万余元。
    此次事件的经过是：济南解放后，华北、华东两区物资顺利流通，但华东区物价较高，棉、布价格相差更大。如以十月十一日的临清棉价为标准，则济南较高百分之二十二，益都较高百分之五十，潍县较高百分之八十一。加以十月中两区货币等价流通，势必更引起华东区商人云集临清大量采购棉花的现象。但是两区的国营贸易机关，在这个时候不但没有采取调剂两区物资，稳定物价的必要办法，而且也随私商之后互相争购，各自为政，无计划无领导地大量吸收，便使棉价大涨。华茂公司看见棉价如此大涨，便停止收买，企图以自己不收买的“姿态”来稳定物价，但其余二十余家国营商店及机关商店，则正纷纷抢购，于是物价继续上涨，私商继续舞弊，市场陷入极度混乱。该地工商局及国营华茂公司见此情形，便于十月十四日召集全市公营贸易机关开会，决定共同停止收购（这个决议也不正确，是让出阵地让私商自由投机），但第二天又以华茂公司为首继续抢购，终至造成上述的棉价及一般物价暴涨和质量降低现象。在此期间，各贸易机关除违反政策外，无政府无纪律现象也很严重，如冀鲁豫之泰兴隆，并未得该行政区政府购买棉花的任务，仅为了运往济南赚钱而私自买了十七、八万斤。这些公司曾于十月二十日获得华北政府的命令，该命令规定“各区公营商店，不许在临清市直接购买棉花，如有需要，可由当地国营商店代购”，但仍想法设计继续收购，如冀南建华一分公司就于得悉此一命令后购入棉花五十万斤之多，终于造成了市场上的上述险恶现象。
