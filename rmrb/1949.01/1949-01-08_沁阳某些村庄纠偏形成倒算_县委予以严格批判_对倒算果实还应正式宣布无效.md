[Taihang Electric] Qinyang convened an enlarged meeting of county, district, and village cadres to review the land reform work that concluded before autumn in the county. After correcting deviations, the masses' enthusiasm for production has increased, with the county adding approximately 2,000 head of livestock, and the urban area of Chengguan adding 82 industrial and commercial businesses. However, some areas have produced quite a few right-leaning errors, boosting the arrogance of landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, attacking some good cadres, and seizing some of the fruits already obtained by the emancipated masses, resulting in a fairly widespread new state of confusion. From the perspective of the entire county, landlord counterattacks were more common in the first, fourth, and seventh districts (all semi-old liberated areas), especially severe in the seventh district. According to preliminary understanding, landlords and rich peasants in the seventh district originally had no households that could not make a living after the land reform, but during the correction of deviations, resettlement was carried out without distinguishing specific targets, and many things were returned. Because these areas had not fully mobilized the masses in the past, this inspection revealed that many villages had only conducted fake struggles, and there are still those who secretly preserve the property of landlords and rent landlord land to share grain. According to statistics from 90 villages, in 25 villages, emancipated masses were made to return the fruits of their struggle under the support of right-leaning cadre thinking; a few bad cadres even helped landlords and rich peasants to seize the fruits already obtained by emancipated peasants; and in 30 villages, the masses did not understand the policy, and landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements directly threatened the masses to return the fruits. According to statistics from eight households of landlords and rich peasants in three villages, they used threats to reclaim 94 mu of land, nine rooms of houses, and three head of livestock. Landlords and rich peasants in Yanzhuang even openly threatened an activist, saying, "Whoever does not return it will be shot in the back! You were active in the struggle in the past, and now we will cut you piece by piece!" In Zhangzhuang Street in the sixth district, the garden plots of seven poor peasants were taken away to resettle landlords and rich peasants and compensate middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against. These poor peasants had an average of 1.6 mu of land per person before emancipation, which increased to 2.5 mu per person after emancipation, but decreased to 1.7 mu per person after the correction of deviations. When some village cadres asked the district cadres, the district cadres said, "Do you still dare to be 'leftist'?" meaning that this was the result of your 'leftist' tendencies. This isolated active cadres, and the emancipated masses did not dare to keep the land, and secretly returned the land that had been distributed before. The masses said, "Before, it was called struggle, but now they say it was wrong. In the future, if we have money, we will buy land ourselves, and if we don't have money, we will have to be oppressed." After inspection, the county party committee decided: 1. To correctly publicize the production and deviation correction policies, and affirm that deviation correction is correct. At the same time, strictly criticize counter-attacks and retaliatory behavior. 2. To decide that before the end of the land reform after the autumn harvest, the county should first conduct in-depth investigations and summarize the experiences and lessons of deviation correction, improve cadres' understanding of deviation correction, and unify policy thinking, so as to correctly lead deviation correction in the completion of the land reform. 3. To specifically resolve the wrongly returned fruits, land, and livestock that have indeed harmed the interests of peasants. (Editor's note: If it is true that landlords and rich peasants threatened peasants to return the fruits, it should be formally declared invalid, and the peasants should be led to resolutely take them back.)

　　沁阳某些村庄纠偏形成倒算
  　县委予以严格批判
    对倒算果实还应正式宣布无效
    【太行电】沁阳召开县区村扩大干部会议，检查该县秋前结束土改工作。该县经过纠偏，群众生产情绪已有提高，全县增加牲口约两千头，城关增加工商业八十二家。但也有若干地区产生了不少右倾错误，助长了地主富农和坏分子的气焰，打击了一部分好的干部，夺取了部分翻身群众已获得的果实，致造成相当普遍的新的混乱现象。从全县看，一、四、七区（均为半老区）地主反攻的村较多，特别是七区严重。据初步了解，七区地主富农在土改后本来没有不能生活的户，但在纠偏中也不分具体对象的进行安置，退回好多东西。因为这类地区过去并未充分发动群众，此次检查，暴露出不少村只进行过假斗争，现在还有暗中保存地主财物和租种地主土地伙分粮食的。这次九十个村统计，二十五个村是在干部右倾思想支持下让翻身群众退了果实；少数坏干部并帮助地富去夺取翻身农民已得果实，有三十个村是群众不了解政策，地主富农和坏分子直接威胁群众退果实。据三个村八户地主富农统计，即以威胁方式要回土地九十四亩，房子九间，牲口三头。言庄地主富农甚至公开威吓一个积极分子说：“谁不退还就打谁的黑枪！过去你们斗争积极，现在非叫一刀一刀剐你不行！”六区张庄一街抽了七户贫雇的园地，安置地主富农补偿错斗中农，这几户贫雇农在未翻身前每人平均土地一亩六分，翻身后增至每人二亩半，纠偏后又减至每人一亩七分了。有的村干部去问区干部，区干部却说：“你们还敢左冒？”意思是说，这是霉你们左倾的结果。这样造成积极干部孤立，翻身群众不敢要地，以前分下的地也偷偷退回。群众说：“以前叫斗争，现在又说错了，以后有钱就自己买地，没钱就只好受压迫。”经过检查，该县县委决定：一、正确宣传生产纠偏政策，肯定纠偏是正确的。同时严格批判反攻倒算与报复行为。二、决定秋后结束土改开始前，全县先深入调查与总结纠偏中的经验教训，提高干部对纠偏的认识，统一政策思想，以便结束土改中正确领导纠偏。三、确实属于伤害农民利益的错退果实与土地、牲口，应给予具体解决。（编者按：如果真是地主富农威胁农民退了果实，应正式宣布无效，并领导农民坚决要回。）
