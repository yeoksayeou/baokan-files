　　Please Jincheng Third Complete Primary School Respond to Comrade He Quanzeng's Inquiry

　　I read the report "Jincheng Third High School Implements Regular Teaching" published in the People's Daily on December 23rd, which stated "Teachers guide self-study, answer difficult questions, students write calligraphy and a diary every other day, and have irregular wall newspapers. There are collective activities at 1 PM every afternoon, with teachers participating in guidance; teachers persist in studying for two hours every day and prepare adequately before class." This is a very thorough and tight schedule for the teachers and students' time. Therefore, I raise the following questions and ask Jincheng Third High School to continue to report on them in order to exchange experiences:

　　1. How many classes and staff members are there in Jincheng Third High School?

　　2. How do the teachers and staff divide the work of student course instruction and homework correction, and how do they allocate their time?

　　3. How many hours of study are there each day? What is the scope of study? How do teachers answer students' questions? Do they answer individually or collectively?

　　4. Is there a student self-government association? What is the organization and activity of the self-government association?

　　请晋城第三完全小学答复和全增同志的询问
    我看了人民日报十二月二十三日刊载“晋城三高实行正规教学”的报导中“教员指导自习，解答疑难问题，学生每天除大小楷及两天写一篇日记外还有不定期壁报，课外下午一点集体活动，教员参加指导；教员每日坚持两点钟学习，课前得充分准备”。这对教员学生时间的支配是很周密紧张的；因此提出下列几个问题，请转晋城三高继续报导，以便交流经验：
    一、晋城三高共有几个班次，几位教职员？
    二、教职员对学生课程进行、作业批改如何分工，如何支配时间？
    三、每天几个钟头学习？学习范围如何？教员怎样解答学生问题？个别答还是集体答？
    四、有无学生自治会？自治会的组织与活动情况如何？
