Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. The top war criminal, bandit Du Yuming, who refused to surrender and used poison gas, will be severely punished by the People's Liberation Army. As late as the 7th and 8th of this month, bandit Du still directed more than ten American-made Kuomintang aircraft to indiscriminately bomb the People's Liberation Army positions surrounding bandit Du in the areas of Liulou, Zuozhai, Liangjing, Zhangxiaozhuang, Zhangxiaolou, Zhanglaozhuang, and Limingzhuang northeast of Dacun, and dropped a large number of poisonous gas bombs, causing many PLA fighters to be poisoned. Because the PLA had taken precautions against the enemy's use of poison, they were all immediately cured. Prior to this, on the 27th of last month, bandit Du had fired tear gas-inducing 3-7 chemical projectiles at the PLA, and at that time seven PLA fighters were also poisoned. After Du Yuming's bandit troops broke out of Xuzhou and fell into the PLA's net again in the northeast of Yongcheng, the path before Du Yuming was very clear: Either surrender or be annihilated. At that time, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army Huaihai Front ordered Du Yuming to quickly order the entire army to lay down their arms and surrender in order to atone for their crimes. However, bandit Du disobeyed the order of the People's Liberation Army and was determined to closely cooperate with the other two war criminals, Zhou Zhirou, commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang Air Force, and Wang Shuming, deputy commander-in-chief, to break through using poison gas. After learning of bandit Du's sinister plan, the People's Liberation Army repeatedly warned bandit Du, saying: Our army has already announced that Du Yuming is a war criminal, but as long as Du Yuming immediately orders the entire army to surrender, does not destroy weapons, and does not use poison gas, then no matter how heinous his past crimes were, our army can still give him a lighter punishment and save his life. But if Du Yuming dares to use poison gas, then after he is captured, he will definitely be severely punished and will not be shown any leniency. What is said is law, do not say that you were not warned. However, Du Yuming, a bandit who resolutely resisted to the end, was unwilling to take advantage of the last opportunity given to him by the People's Liberation Army on behalf of the Chinese people, disregarded the warnings of the People's Liberation Army, continued to fight, and continued to use poison gas. Therefore, bandit Du not only lost the last opportunity to redeem himself, but also made his crimes even worse. Now, Du Yuming has fallen into the net of justice, and his sins, especially his crime of daring to repeatedly resist the orders of the People's Liberation Army and using poison gas, will surely be met with the severe retribution of justice.
    Du Yuming's lesson should be remembered by other war criminals and Kuomintang military officers, especially by Fu Zuoyi, Li Wen, and Shi Jue in Beiping, Chen Changjie and Lin Weichou in Tianjin, and Hou Jingru in Tanggu. The headquarters of the People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front has issued the same warning to them as it did to Du Yuming, telling them that even if they are war criminals, as long as they can lead their troops to surrender in this critical moment, protect weapons, protect the property of the country and the people, and protect the lives of revolutionary political prisoners and the general public, then the People's Liberation Army will still allow them to atone for their crimes. If they disobey the orders of the People's Liberation Army and disregard the warnings of the People's Liberation Army, they will also be unable to escape the net of revolutionary justice like Du Yuming.

　　一再抗拒投降并胆敢施放毒气
  　战犯杜聿明将受严惩
  　平津蒋傅匪应记取这个教训
    【新华社陕北十三日电】拒不投降并施放毒气的头等战犯杜匪聿明，将受到人民解放军的严厉惩罚。杜匪直至本月七、八两日，尚主使美制国民党飞机十余架，向包围杜匪的人民解放军阵地大回村东北的刘楼、左砦、梁井、张小庄、张小楼、张老庄、李明庄一带，滥施轰炸，并投掷大量毒瓦斯弹，使解放军战士多人中毒。由于解放军对敌人的放毒事先预有戒备，故皆立即治愈。在这以前，在上月二十七日，杜匪即曾向解放军放射催泪性三七化学抛射弹，当时亦有解放军战士七人中毒。当杜聿明匪部由徐州突围到永城东北地区再度陷入解放军的天罗地网以后，摆在杜聿明面前的道路已经十分明白：不投降就要被消灭。那时，人民解放军淮海前线司令部便命令杜聿明，赶快下令全军缴械投降，将功折罪。但杜匪违抗人民解放军的命令，决心与另外两个战犯国民党空军总司令周至柔和副总司令王叔铭密切合作，利用毒气突围。人民解放军在获悉杜匪这一凶谋以后，又再三向杜匪发出警告说：本军已经宣布杜聿明是战争罪犯，但只要杜聿明立即下令全军投降，不破坏武器，不施用毒气，则无论他过去如何罪恶滔天，本军仍可从轻议处，保全他的生命。但如果杜聿明敢于施放毒气，则本军在拿获归案后，必定严厉惩办，决不宽贷。言出法从，毋谓言之不预。可是坚决反动到底的杜匪聿明，不愿意利用人民解放军代表中国人民给予他的最后的机会，玩忽人民解放军的警告，继续作战并继续使用毒气。因此杜匪不仅失去了最后的自赎的机会，而且使自己罪上加罪。现在，杜聿明已经落入法网，他的一身罪恶，尤其是他胆敢一再抗拒人民解放军命令而使用毒气的罪行，必将受到正义的严厉的报复。
    杜聿明的这个教训，应当被其他战争罪犯和国民党军将领所记取，首先是应当被北平的傅作义、李文、石觉，天津的陈长捷、林伟俦，塘沽的侯镜如等所记取。人民解放军平津前线司令部已向他们提出了与对于杜聿明同样的警告，告诉他们即使身为战犯，只要能在紧急关头率部投降，保护武器，保护国家与人民的财产，保护革命政治犯和一般人民的生命，则人民解放军仍允许他们将功折罪。如果他们违抗人民解放军的命令，玩忽人民解放军的警告，他们也将与杜聿明同样逃不脱革命的法网。
