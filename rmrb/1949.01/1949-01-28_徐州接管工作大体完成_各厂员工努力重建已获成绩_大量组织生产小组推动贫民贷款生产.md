Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: Xuzhou, a strategic point in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, has largely completed its takeover work and achieved considerable results in reconstruction since its liberation on December 1st of last year.

　　On the second day of Xuzhou's liberation, the Military Control Commission entered the city to carry out the takeover work. The takeover was carried out department by department from top to bottom. The Xuzhou Military Control Commission established seventeen departments: Finance, Industry and Commerce, Finance and Grain, Ordnance, Military Supplies, Culture and Education, Railways, Post and Telecommunications, Radio, Mining, Publishing, Production, Health, Public Security, Highway Transportation, Industry, and Civil Affairs. Employees of various factories, institutions, and schools belonging to the Kuomintang government in Xuzhou, influenced by the correct policies implemented by the People's Liberation Army in Jinan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other places, automatically protected the construction equipment of their respective units after the Kuomintang bandit troops fled Xuzhou, and automatically reported to the Military Control Commission when the People's Liberation Army entered the city. For example, more than 320 employees of the power plant automatically established a Materials Protection and Management Committee, protecting all materials and equipment intact; more than 200 employees of the telecommunications bureau also established a custody committee to guard equipment and materials; all employees of the post office, from the director down to more than 200 people, remained at their posts, and no materials, letters, or packages were lost in the entire bureau. The staff of the Xuzhou Military Control Commission conscientiously implemented the "Seven Articles of the Covenant" promulgated by the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the entry rules issued by the Military Control Commission, and conscientiously protected all private property except for the institutions and materials belonging to the Kuomintang government and the Four Big Families, which had been taken over. Therefore, the entire takeover work was well-ordered and proceeded smoothly, creating favorable conditions for the reconstruction of this city with a population of more than 400,000.

　　Thanks to the employees' protection of equipment, the power plant resumed power supply as usual on the second day of liberation. In terms of transportation, workers rebuilt six major postal trunk lines, restored more than 800 household telephones in the city and long-distance telephones from Xuzhou to Suxian and Xuzhou to Lincheng, and railways were repaired section by section and opened to traffic section by section. Railway employees worked day and night in the wind and snow to repair the railways, greatly improving work efficiency. Five of the nine public factories, including power generation, tap water, ordnance repair, matches, and sugar production, have resumed work after the takeover, and the remaining four are preparing to resume work. Fourteen of the eighteen private flour mills have resumed work, and the remaining four will also resume work before the Lunar New Year. Eighty percent of all shops have resumed business. Most school buildings and equipment are relatively complete, and very few teachers and staff have left the school. Seventy-three public and private primary and secondary schools have resumed classes within a month, with more than 26,000 students enrolled.

　　While the takeover and reconstruction work were being carried out simultaneously, Xuzhou also completed the task of supporting the front lines. Once the railway was repaired, it took on the transportation tasks in support of the front. The Ordnance and Military Supplies Departments of the Military Control Commission collected a large number of ordnance and military supplies to supply the front. The Highway Transportation Department organized more than 200 commercial vehicles to participate in front-line transportation, and various agencies and factories also completed various front-line support tasks under the leadership of the Military Control Commission.

　　For the impoverished citizens who were trapped in hunger and hardship due to the Kuomintang bandit gang's extortion and exploitation, the Xuzhou Municipal People's Government issued the first batch of 150,000 catties of relief grain, which was distributed on the 4th of this month. In order to help them engage in production, the Beihai Bank issued the first batch of small loans of 400 million yuan. After dispelling the poor citizens' concerns about not being able to keep all the money they earned from the loans, each district convened a forum for loan recipients to discuss production methods. From the 9th to the 13th of this month, the first, third, and fourth districts formed 103 production groups, planning to engage in production activities such as selling vegetables and transporting grain. Many rickshaw pullers and flatbed cart pullers engaged in transportation production after receiving loans. Rickshaw puller Su Kaitian and two partners borrowed money and transported 270 catties of oil from the countryside, earning 216,000 yuan in Beihai currency in one go. Due to the impact of the loan recipients who profited from production, the number of impoverished citizens requesting loans is increasing day by day. Currently, one district in the fourth district has developed 107 production groups, with a total of 421 households participating in the group, with a total loan of more than 49 million yuan. The result of the bank's loans not only enabled the impoverished citizens to make a living but also increased the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, balancing urban and rural prices.

　　徐州接管工作大体完成
  　各厂员工努力重建已获成绩
    大量组织生产小组推动贫民贷款生产
    【新华社华东二十六日电】苏鲁豫皖四省要冲的徐州，自去年十二月一日解放以来，接管工作已大体完成，重建工作也已获得相当成绩。
    徐州解放的次日，军事管制委员会即入城进行接管工作。接管系由上而下地分部进行。徐州军管会下设了十七个部，即：金融、工商、财粮、军械、军实、文教、铁道、邮电、无线电、工矿、出版、生产、卫生、公安、公路运输、实业、政务。徐州国民党政府所属各工厂、机关、学校的员工，由于受到人民解放军在济南、开封、郑州等地正确执行政策的影响，在国民党匪军从徐州逃窜后，即自动保护了所属单位的建设器材，并在人民解放军入城时，即自动向军管会报告。如发电厂员工三百二十余人自动成立了资材保护管理委员会，保护了全部物资器材完好无损；电讯局员工二百余人亦成立了保管委员会守卫器材物资；邮局自局长以下员工二百余人全部未离职守，全局资材、信件、包裹均未损失。徐市军管会工作人员则认真执行了人民解放军华东军区公布的约法七章和军管会颁布的入城守则，除将属于国民党政府及四大家族的机关、物资已予接管外，属于私人的物资一律认真保护。因此整个接管工作秩序良好，进行顺利，使这一拥有四十余万人口的城市的重建工作获得有利的条件。
    由于员工们的保护器材，发电厂在解放的第二日便照常供电。交通方面，工人们重建了六大通邮干线，恢复了八百余户的市内电话和徐州至宿县及徐州至临城的长途电话，铁路逐段修复，逐段通车。铁路员工们为了抢修铁路，曾在风雪中昼夜坚持工作，并大大提高了工作效率。发电、自来水、修械、火柴、制糖等九座公营工厂，接管后已有五座复工，其余四座正筹备复工中。十八家私营面粉厂中已有十四家复工，其余四家也将于旧历年前复工。全部商店百分之八十已恢复营业。学校大部校舍、校具均较完整，教职员离校者甚少，公私立中小学七十三校已在一个月内复课，入学学生达两万六千余名。
    在接管与重建工作同时进行中，徐州并完成了支援前线的任务。铁路一经修复，即负担支前的运输任务。军管会军械、军实两部，搜集了大批军械、军需品供应前方，公路运输部组织了二百余辆商车参加支前运输，各机关工厂在军管会领导下也完成了各种支前任务。
    对于因国民党匪帮的敲榨剥削而陷于饥寒困苦的贫苦市民，徐州市人民政府发给首批救济粮十五万斤，已于本月四日发放完毕。为了帮助他们进行生产，北海银行发放了首批小本贷款四亿元。在打破贫苦市民怕贷了款赚得钱不能完全归自己等顾虑之后，各区召开了贷款户座谈会讨论生产办法。本月九日至十三日，一、三、四三个区即组成生产小组一百零三个，纷纷计划从事贩菜运粮等生产。不少洋车夫和排子车夫在得到贷款后进行运输生产，车夫苏开田和两个伙伴贷到款子后，到乡下贩运来油二百七十斤，一次就赚了北海票二十一万六千元。由于生产获利的贷款户的影响推动，要求贷款的贫苦市民日益增多，现四区一个区生产小组已发展到一百零七个，参加小组的共四百二十一户，共贷得四千九百余万元。银行贷款的结果，不仅使贫苦市民得以谋生，而且增加了城乡物资的交流，平衡了城乡的物价。
