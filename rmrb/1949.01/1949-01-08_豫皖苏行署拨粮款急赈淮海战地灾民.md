    [Xinhua News Agency, Huai-Hai Front, 26th] Following the complete annihilation of the Kuomintang bandit army Huang Wei Corps in mid-month, the Yu-Wan-Su three special districts (Xia邑, and other nine counties) immediately formed a post-war relief work committee, headed by Deputy Commissioner Li Shizhuang and four others. They first allocated 1 million catties of grain and 5 million yuan in Zhongzhou currency for emergency relief to civilians in the war zone. In addition, a hospital was established to accommodate wounded enemy soldiers, and 1,000 stretchers were allocated to carry wounded enemy soldiers abandoned by the bandit army. People in and near the war zone were also organized to dig pits and deeply bury the enemy corpses on the battlefield to prevent epidemics after the war.
