Shijiazhuang Workers' Correspondents Symposium
	Strengthening Reporting on Workers' Lives
	Workers Propose Making Friends with This Newspaper
[This Newspaper's Report] On the evening of January 7th, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a symposium for worker correspondents in the city. Participants included propaganda committee members and correspondents from factory trade unions such as Fanrong Factory, Guangming Factory, Northern Printing Bureau, North China United Factory, North China Leather Factory, and the Telephone Bureau. In addition to representatives from this newspaper, Song, Director of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Li Zhen, and other responsible comrades were present to provide guidance. Each comrade present frankly pointed out the inadequacies of past urban reporting, offered criticisms, and discussed in detail how to report on factory work in the future. Everyone unanimously agreed: "This matter requires our collective efforts; otherwise, it will not be done well."

At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Zhang of the Propaganda and Education Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions explained that the People's Daily had opened a city edition focusing on Shijiazhuang and other medium-sized cities in North China to strengthen ties with the people of various cities, especially with workers. He hoped that everyone would discuss how to reflect workers' demands in the newspaper in the future.

Wang Guan, a typesetting worker from the Northern Printing Factory, first made a self-criticism, saying: "In the past, when I was in Zhangjiakou, I often wrote articles for the newspaper, but since last year, I haven't written much. The reason is the anti-'Keli Kong' [a derogatory term for someone who is all talk and no action], and the leadership said that manuscripts must be reviewed by the political commissar, otherwise the newspaper would not use them. In short, I have not fulfilled this due obligation. We have not written well for the Party newspaper, and we must improve in the future." Deng Yi, a worker from the North China United Factory, said: "The People's Daily publishes a lot about farmers, but it reflects very little about the demands of workers." Chen Wei, a young female worker from Fanrong Factory, said: "It's not that the young workers in our factory are unwilling to write, but they don't know what to write. In the past, many manuscripts were written but not used, and it wasn't explained why."

When talking about the requirements for this newspaper's city edition, everyone unanimously proposed: to use the largest space in this edition to reflect the lives of workers. Dong Ruilin from Guangming Factory said: "I hope that in terms of form, there will be more quick rhymes and short, concise articles suitable for workers. Workers are particularly interested in the news report titled 'Dispute' published by the original People's Daily on page four." Finally, everyone requested a workers' life column to reflect more workers' voices, workers' criticisms and suggestions, and so on.

At this meeting, everyone made demands on the editors and reporters of the newspaper, hoping that they would be more patient in reading the manuscripts written by workers. Reporters should visit factories more often, go deep into the workers, truly become one with the workers, and understand their demands. They hoped that reporters would take on more apprentices, help workers write, and cultivate workers' writing skills. In the future, the newspaper should introduce more things about writing knowledge.

Comrade Li Zhen of the Federation of Trade Unions said: "In the past, we lived in the countryside for a long time, which alienated the Party newspaper from the workers. Now we are making a quick change. Worker comrades should take the initiative to make friends with the People's Daily, actively contact the newspaper, and write their demands and opinions to the newspaper." At the same time, he hoped that the newspaper would also send people to reflect more workers' opinions. He said: "A Communist Party newspaper even publishes the misclassification of landlords and rich peasants, but rarely publishes the demands and opinions of the working class. This is too inappropriate. Workers should boldly reflect their opinions on life, production, and factory management, writing both good and bad, and opposing 'reporting good news' and not 'reporting bad news.' In order to improve the factory, we are not afraid of anything. In the future, except for issues related to numbers, etc., worker-written manuscripts should be reviewed by the responsible comrades of the factory, but other demands, opinions, criticisms, and suggestions do not need to be reviewed by the leaders and can be sent directly to the People's Daily." The meeting continued until late at night before it ended.

　　石家庄工人通讯员座谈会
  　加强报导工人生活
  　工人提出要跟本报交朋友
    【本报讯】一月七日晚，石家庄市总工会，召开了本市工人通讯员座谈会，到会的计有繁荣厂、光明厂、北方印刷局、华北联合工厂、华北皮革厂、电话局等工厂工会宣传委员及通讯员同志，会议除有本报派人参加外，市总工会宋主任、李贞等负责同志亲临指导。到会的每个同志都毫无拘束的指出过去城市报导的不够，提出批评，并详细讨论今后应如何对工厂工作报导问题，大家一致认为：“这件事要靠咱们大家齐心努力，不然还办不好。”
    会议开始，首由市总工会宣教委员张同志，说明人民日报开辟了以石家庄市为重点的华北各中等城市的城市版，加强与各城市人民的联系，特别是与工人的联系，希望大家讨论今后如何把工人的要求反映到报纸上去。
    北方印刷厂排字工人汪贯一同志，对自己首先作了检讨，他说：“过去在张家口的时候自己经常给报纸写稿，但从去年以来，写的不多了，原因是反‘客里空’，加以领导上说稿件一定要经过政委审查，否则报纸不用，总之自己是没有负起这个应尽的义务。我们没有很好地给党报写稿，今后要改进。”华北联合工厂工人邓毅同志说：“人民日报登农民的事多，关于工人的要求反映的就很少。”繁荣厂青年女工陈玮说：“我们厂里青年工人还不是不愿意写，就是不知道写什么，过去写了不少的稿子没有见用，也不给指出为什么不用。”
    谈到对本报城市版的要求时，大家一致提出：要在这一版以最大的篇幅反映工人的生活。光明厂董瑞麟同志说：“希望在形式上多搞些适合工人口吻的快板、短小精悍的文章，原人民日报在四版发表的题为‘纠纷’的通讯，工人特别感兴趣。”最后大家要求设工人生活栏，更多的反映工人呼声、工人批评与建议等。
    在这个会议上，大家对报社编辑、记者同志提出了要求，希望对工人写的稿子要耐心一些看，记者应该多跑工厂，深入到工人中去，真正和工人打成一片，了解他们的要求，希望记者同志多带徒弟，帮助工人写，培养工人的写作能力，今后报纸上应多介绍一些关于写作知识方面的东西。
    总工会李贞同志说：“过去我们长期住在农村，使得党报和工人疏远了，现在赶快来一个转变，工人同志主动地跟人民日报交朋友，主动的向报纸联系，把自己的要求、意见写给报纸。”同时他希望报纸也要派人来，多反映些工人的意见，他说：“一个共产党的报纸，连那些地主、富农的成份划错了还在报上发表，而工人阶级的要求、意见，却发表的很少，这太不应该了。工人们应大胆的反映自己对生活上的、生产上的、工厂管理上的意见，好坏都写，反对‘报喜’不‘报忧’。为了把工厂搞好，我们什么都不怕，今后工人写的稿子除去有关数目字等问题，经厂方负责同志看一看外，其他自己要求、意见、批评与建议等，都不必经过领导同志看，可直接寄给人民日报社。”会议一直进行到深夜，才结束了。
