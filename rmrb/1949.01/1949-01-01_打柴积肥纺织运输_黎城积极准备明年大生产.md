　　Collecting Firewood, Accumulating Fertilizer, Weaving, and Transporting
  　Licheng Actively Prepares for Next Year's Great Production
    [Taihang News] After the conclusion of land reform in Licheng, all classes are united. Under the active leadership of party members, cadres, and labor heroes, winter production has been widely carried out, laying a good foundation for next year's great production. The county has a total of one hundred and fifty-three cooperatives, which have undergone preliminary rectification, clarified their business guidelines, and organized supply and marketing to assist farmers in winter production. Villages have opened up a variety of production avenues based on their different production conditions, such as relying on the mountains for resources and relying on the roads for transport. For example, Duan Yongfu, a hero from the fourth district cooperative, organized the masses to produce after returning from the county's production conference. In one month, they transported more than 10,000 jin of coal, collected more than 21,700 jin of firewood, and accumulated more than 17,000 dan of fertilizer. He organized transport and sales, earning more than 3,000 yuan (new currency). Shi Cunjin, a labor hero from Huojia Kiln, organized 72 livestock to engage in transport and sales, earning more than 50,000 yuan in one month. He organized seven firewood collecting teams, collecting a total of more than 168,000 jin of firewood. He also put forward production slogans such as "Those who travel eat well, those who sit eat nothing, everyone completes 1.5 shi of grain," "Each livestock contributes 3 shi of grain," "The broom sweeps, the manure pile grows," and "More fertilizer, more grain." Ma Sannv, a weaving hero from Langou, took out five silver yuan to join the cooperative, influencing the whole village to invest more than 10,000 yuan. This not only expanded the cooperative's capital but also helped the masses in production. As a result of profitable production, farmers have been buying livestock, carts, and repairing houses. According to statistics from ten villages including Huo Xiangdao and Shanye in the third district, sixty houses have been built and eighty-one kilns have been repaired since autumn. Xiaokou and Xihuangxu villages alone bought twenty-two carts. According to statistics from eighteen villages including Huo Xiangdao, eighteen donkeys, six cattle, and one mule and one horse each were bought. The livestock running transport and sales in the first district have earned an average of more than 4.7 dou of millet per head. According to incomplete statistics from 141 villages in the county, transport and sales earned more than 710,000 yuan in one month; 229 workshops earned more than 830,000 yuan. According to statistics from the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, more than 4,235,000 jin of firewood were collected, and women spun more than 30,000 jin of cotton, weaving more than 13,000 jin of cloth. At present, in addition to three-fifths of the cadres combining production with issuing land certificates and rectifying the party, the remaining cadres are vigorously leading winter production.
