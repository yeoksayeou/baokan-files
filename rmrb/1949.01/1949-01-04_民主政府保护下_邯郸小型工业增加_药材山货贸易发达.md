[Jinan Telegram] Under the protection and assistance of the democratic government, Handan's industry and commerce have gradually recovered and developed over the past year, and are increasingly prospering. As of the end of September, the city has a total of 1,878 industrial and commercial households, including 764 industrial households and 1,114 commercial households. Over the past year, small-scale industries (including workshops) have increased by approximately 82% or more compared to the past, and commerce has increased by 62.8%. Small-scale industries such as ironworking, cotton weaving, chalk making, and cigarette manufacturing have developed more rapidly. The iron industry has increased by 450% compared to the past, cotton weaving has increased threefold, and the chalk industry, due to the smooth flow of trade between the north and south and the continuous import of raw materials, has grown from only seven businesses last year to 41 now. Cigarette manufacturing, previously banned from private operation, has now been restored with 51 businesses. Commercial sectors closely related to national economy and people's livelihood, such as grain, groceries, cotton, oil, medicinal materials, merchant houses, and transportation, have all experienced widespread development. The city's housing is gradually becoming insufficient. Medicinal material shops, grocery stores, and mountain product stores are developing rapidly. Since the smooth flow of trade between the north and south, mountain products and medicinal materials can be exported in exchange for Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials. According to statistics from January to June of last year, the export volume of codonopsis pilosula totaled over 91,400 catties, compared to the total export of 68,219 catties in the previous year, with the average monthly export volume exceeding nearly five times that of the previous year. On average, about 50 merchants come and go every day. They gradually understood the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies and laws protecting human rights through tentative operations and are willing to do business with merchants in the liberated areas. Three merchants from Zhengzhou want to move to the city, saying, "The cost of living in the liberated areas is low, and business is good." They also pointed out that a Xinxiang merchant from Qingsheng Pharmacy came to Handan at the end of the twelfth lunar month the year before last with only 30,000 yuan in New Currency and had expanded it to 200,000 yuan by August last year. Last year, various medicinal material shops borrowed 7 million yuan from the bank to purchase goods and transport them to the enemy-occupied areas in exchange for Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials to catch up with the autumn medicinal material fair. The merchants expressed great satisfaction.

　　民主政府保护下
  　邯郸小型工业增加
  　药材山货贸易发达
    【冀南电】在民主政府的保护与帮助之下，邯郸工商业一年来逐步恢复发展，日渐走向繁荣。现全市截至九月底，计有工商业一千八百七十八户，其中工业七百六十四户，商业一千一百一十四户。一年来小型工业（包括作坊）较过去增加约百分之八十二以上，商业增加百分之六十二点八。小型工业又以铁工、棉织、粉笔、卷烟等业发展较速，铁工业较过去增加百分之四百五十，棉织业增加了三倍，粉笔业由于南北贸易畅通后，原料不断输入，去年只有七家，现在已有四十一家，卷烟过去禁止私营，现在重新恢复的有五十一家。和国计民生有密切关系的商业如粮食、杂货、棉业、油业、药材、行庄、运输等都有普遍的发展。市面上的房子，已渐不敷用。药材行、杂货行、山货行发展很快，自从南北贸易畅通后，山货药材随着可以出口换取川广药材，出口数量，根据去年一月份至六月份的统计，共输出党参九万一千四百余斤，较前年全年输出党参六万八千二百一十九斤，平均每月输出量超过前年几近五倍。往来客商，平均每日约五十人左右。他们由一个两个的试探性的经营，逐渐了解了民主政府的工商业政策与保障人权的法令，愿意与解放区商人打交道。郑州三个客商，想搬到本市来住，他们说：“解放区的生活程度低，生意好做”。并且指出庆生药行的一位新乡客商，前年腊月初来邯郸，仅有资金合新币三万元，到去年八月已扩展为二十万元。去年各药材行向银行贷款七百万元，购买出货运往敌占区，换取川广药材，来赶秋季药材大会，该商等表示非常满意。
