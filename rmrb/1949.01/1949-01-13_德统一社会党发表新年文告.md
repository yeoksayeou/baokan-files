　　Socialist Unity Party of Germany Issues New Year's Message
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: The Central Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a New Year's message to the German working people, opposing the crimes of the United States, Britain, and France in splitting Germany, and calling for "striving for German reunification," "striving for the victory of a new democratic order throughout Germany," and "striving for peace, democracy, and socialism." The message stated that 1948 was a year of sharp struggle for German reunification and democratization. The so-called London "recommendations" passed by the Six-Power Conference marked the beginning of a treacherous movement to divide Germany. The message listed the various arbitrary acts of the Western occupying powers in dismembering Germany and Berlin. The message further pointed out that the working people of Berlin responded to this series of crimes by establishing a new democratic municipal committee, which is conducting a vigorous struggle to strive for a single currency, a single government, unified supply, and the democratization of the entire life of the German capital. The message emphasized that the struggle to restore Berlin's unity is inseparable from the struggle to achieve German reunification. All democratic and progressive forces of our people resolutely refuse to recognize the division of Germany as an accomplished fact, and respond to it by redoubling their resistance to the imperialist splitters, warmongers, and their lackeys, who have exposed themselves as the deadly enemies of the German people, peace, and democracy. The resolutions of the Warsaw Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies show that we are not alone in this struggle. We have the firm support of all peace-loving forces in the world. The Central Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party supports the German people's desire to turn the Ruhr industry into state property, which will ensure that the Ruhr never becomes a "war arsenal." The Central Bureau calls on the people of the Soviet occupation zone to consolidate the new democratic order, develop a peaceful economy, and increase labor productivity. The message was signed by Wilhelm Pieck and Otto Grotewohl, chairmen of the Socialist Unity Party.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: TASS, Berlin, 6th: Otto Grotewohl, chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, commented on the announcement of the cessation of work cooperation between the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Germany, stating that the reason for the need to cease work cooperation between the two parties is due to the fact that in the Soviet occupation zone, the Socialist Unity Party can carry out political activities on the basis of the already substantial progress in democratization, while in West Germany, the Communist Party must struggle to win the establishment of democratic prerequisites. Thus, the conditions for the political struggle of the two parties are completely different. In fighting against the reactionaries in the Western occupation zones, the Communist Party must take decisions based on the political situation that has already arisen in the Western occupation zones. Grotewohl continued: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany will cooperate with the Communist Party in the same way that it will cooperate with every party that is prepared to fight for Germany's unification, democratization, and demilitarization. The cooperation of all parties engaged in these goals is more necessary than ever before, because recent international events, such as the publication of the Ruhr Agreement, which stipulates further enslavement of the German industrial center of the Ruhr, and the anticipated West German Occupation Statute, which will stipulate long-term occupation of West Germany instead of concluding a peace treaty and withdrawing the occupying forces, have made it imperative to unite all forces in Germany fighting for peace, unity, and democracy.

　　德统一社会党发表新年文告
    【新华社陕北八日电】德国统一社会党中央局发表新年告德国劳动人民书，反对美英法分裂德国的罪行，并号召“争取德国统一”，“争取新的民主秩序在全德获得胜利”，“争取和平、民主和社会主义”。该文告称：一九四八年是争取德国统一及民主化尖锐斗争的一年。六国会议通过的所谓伦敦“建议”，标志着诡谲的分裂德国运动的开始。文告列举西方占领国家肢解德国及柏林的各种专横行为。文告进而指出：柏林劳动人民对于这一连串罪行，以成立新的民主市政委员会来回答，这个委员会进行强力的斗争，以争取全柏林单一货币、单一政府、统一供给和德国首都整个生活的民主化。文告强调指出：恢复柏林统一的斗争，是与争取德国统一的斗争分不开的。我们人民的一切民主进步力量，断然拒绝承认德国的分裂为一既成事实，并以加倍反抗帝国主义分裂者、战争贩子及他们的从仆来回答它，这些人已经暴露了他们自己是德国人民、和平和民主的死敌。苏联及人民民主国家外长的华沙会议的决议，表明我们在这一斗争中不是孤独的。我们得到全世界爱好和平势力的确定的支持。统一社会党中央局支持德国人民要求把鲁尔工业变为国家财产的愿望，这将保障鲁尔永不变成“战争兵工厂”。中央局号召苏占区人民巩固新的民主秩序，发展和平经济，增加劳动生产率。文告由统一社会党主席皮克及格罗提渥签名。
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社柏林六日讯：德国统一社会党主席格罗提渥评德国统一社会党与德国共产党停止工作上的协作的公告称：两党之需要停止工作的协作，是由于下列事实，即在苏占区中，统一社会党可以在已获长足进展的民主化基础上进行政治活动，而在西德，共产党则必须为争取建立民主的前提而斗争。这样，两党的政治斗争的条件是完全不同的。共产党在对西占区反动派进行斗争时，必须根据西占区中已经产生的政治情势来采取决定。格罗提渥继称：德国统一社会党将与共产党合作，象它将与每一个准备为德国的统一、民主化和非军事化而奋斗的党派合作一样。所有从事于这些目的的党派的合作，较已往任何时候更加必要，因为最近的国际事件，如规定更进一步奴役德国工业中心鲁尔的鲁尔协定的公布，以及预计中的将规定长期占领西德而不是缔结和约和撤退占领军的西德占领法规等，已使德国一切为和平、统一与民主而斗争的力量联合起来，成为当务之急。
