How Do Workers at the Shijiazhuang Electric Company Study?
    After the Enterprise Department issued a notice regarding test questions for cadres' study, and the North China Central Bureau gave specific instructions for on-the-job cadre study, the Shijiazhuang Electric Company launched enthusiastic discussions and arrangements. Because workers' general education levels varied, they were divided into advanced and elementary groups for preliminary testing (the questions were based on the twenty-four questions issued by the Enterprise Department). However, the test results showed that because most cadres did not usually pay attention to current affairs and political study, the overall passing rate was less than 15%. Others gave irrelevant or nonsensical answers, or submitted blank papers. For example, some used a lot of terms like "revolution!" and "people's liberation!" which only made things more confusing. Some even wrote incomprehensible terms like "popular revolutionary forces," "national capitalist state," and "proletarian people." Some even listed Spain as a new democratic country, and the date of the establishment of the North China People's Government was written as August 26, 1936, and many people copied each other. There are many such examples. Although everyone's test scores were very poor, their spirit of learning was very good. To answer a question, they flipped through newspapers and books, and asked people for help. Even the old workers in the Power Supply Section, who had a low level of education, bought several reference books to study. This study and test stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for learning. Worker Bao Hongwen said: "I usually don't read newspapers and don't study hard, so now I'm busy; I must study hard in the future!" Under this encouragement, everyone became serious about learning. Some workers themselves suggested that the trade union should organize literacy classes to strengthen organized learning.
    Now, the company's Party, government, and union have earnestly organized a study committee, and in accordance with the instructions of the North China Central Bureau and the Municipal Party Committee, have arranged a study plan. The entire company is divided into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A takes self-study (research and discussion), Group B attends classes, and Group C learns to read. Workers study for one hour a day, and cadres study for two hours. Everyone has the confidence that they will do well on the next test.

　　石家庄电灯公司工人是怎样学习的？
    石家庄电灯公司在企业部通知干部学习测验题、以及华北中央局对在职干部学习具体指示以后，即展开了热烈的讨论布置，因一般工人文化水准不一样，分成了高级初级两组来做初步测验（题目系根据企业部发下的二十四个题）。但是测验的结果，因为一般干部平常不留心时事及政治的学习，在这次测验总的成绩来说，及格的还不到百分之十五，其他答的牛腿头不对马嘴的和交白卷的很多。比如用了一堆什么革命呀！人民解放呀！这些名词，使人看了更糊涂。更有的写了一些弄不通的名词，比如“民众革命势力”、“资本民族国家”、“无产阶级的人民”，还有的把西班牙也列入新民主主义国家，华北人民政府成立的日子竟写成了三十六年八月二十六日，就这样大家互相抄的还很多。象这类的例子还很多。虽然大家答得成绩是很差，但是大家学习的精神很好，为了答一个题，翻报纸、翻书、找人问，甚至连供电科的老工友们，文化程度很浅，也去买了好几本参考书来学习。由于这次学习测验，激发起了大家学习热潮，工友鲍鸿文说：平常不看报，不好好的学习，现在忙了；以后非好好用功不行！大家都在这样激励下，对学习认真了。有的工友自己提出来：职工会今后应该组织识字班，加强组织学习。
    现在公司党政工为了大家的学习，认真组织了学委会，并根据了华北中央局及市委指示，布置了学习计划。全公司分成了甲、乙、丙三组，甲组采取自学（研究讨论），乙组上课，丙组识字。工人每天学习一小时，干部学习二小时。大家都有这样信心：下次测验一定要答好。
