【Taihang News】During the rectification of wartime service in Tongtan Town, Zuoquan, villagers enthusiastically discussed and formulated wartime service agreements for men and women separately:

Men's Wartime Service Agreement:

　　One: Cultivate land on behalf of military families and martyrs' families, ensuring that it is not left uncultivated. Two: Ensure that military families and martyrs' families do not experience difficulties with firewood, coal, and water. Three: Whether supporting the front or participating in combat, be ready to go whenever dispatched, without haggling over terms. Four: Whether supporting the front or participating in combat, be sure to complete the task. Five: Strive to achieve merit and be a model in supporting the front.

Women's Wartime Service Agreement:

　　One: Maintain family harmony and avoid anger and quarrels due to departures for service. Two: Treat soldiers hospitably, without shirking responsibility, with enthusiasm and responsibility. Three: Make military shoes that are sturdy, durable, and made of good materials. Four: Help passing military personnel and military families with sewing. Women with large feet should also collect stretchers and perform light duties. Five: Take into account both public and private affairs, not neglecting either the family or outside duties, and strive to be a model weaver.

After the formulation of the agreements, evaluations of merits and demerits were conducted (for example, upon returning from participating in the Jinzhong campaign, Liu Fushan and two others were commended as leadership models, and Zhao Haizhu and fifteen others were commended as grain transportation models), and the meeting review system was improved: summarize once a month, and settle accounts once every three months. Basically, those who attend more frequently are dispatched less, and those who attend less frequently are dispatched more. If necessary, wages are used to make up the difference. Under the principle of mutual labor and animal power assistance, it is stipulated that production should be organized while serving in wartime services, such as organizing return trips when going out for duty; while obeying production, undertake wartime services, and select skilled farmers to produce according to the season, and assign clumsy labor to support the front. Attendance points and mutual assistance points are distributed as a whole.

　　桐滩制订战勤公约
  　男女分担不误生产
    【太行讯】左权桐滩镇整顿战勤中，村民热烈讨论，男女分别订出战勤公约：
    男人战勤公约：
    一、给军烈属干属代耕土地，保证不荒。二、不能使军烈属柴煤水感到困难。三、不论支差与参战，要随派随走，不讲价钱。四、不管支差或参战，一定要完成任务。五、在支差中，人人争取立功，当模范。
    妇女战勤公约：
    一、要做到家庭和睦，不为出差生气打架。二、招待军人不推诿，热情负责。三、做军鞋，要做到结实、耐穿、材料好。四、帮助过路军干人员及军烈属缝纫，大脚妇女并要拾担架和出轻差。五、公私兼顾，家外不误，争取当纺织模范。
    制订公约后，进行了评功评过（如晋中参战回来，表扬了刘富山等三人为领导模范，赵海珠等十五人为运粮模范），健全了会议检讨制度：一个月总结一次，三个月算帐一次。基本上是掌握出勤多者少派；出勤少者多派；必要时以工资补齐。在劳畜力勤务互助工的原则下规定了：在服务战勤下，组织生产，如出勤时组织回脚；服从生产下，负担勤务，按季节选出农作能手生产，笨工支差。出勤分和互助分整体分红。
