　　Conquering Nature, Guaranteeing Bumper Harvests Every Year!
  　The Soviet Union Creates Forest Shelterbelts
    Academy of Sciences Intensifies Technical Research, Large Numbers of Experts Complete Training
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th] The Soviet Union's great plan to create forest shelterbelts, transform nature, and guarantee bumper harvests every year is proceeding with the astonishing vigor characteristic of a socialist country. According to TASS reports: The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a report on December 30, 1948, on the implementation of the plan. The report pointed out that the government and the Party's "Plan for Creating Forest Shelterbelts, Implementing Crop and Pasture Rotation Systems, and Constructing Ponds and Reservoirs to Guarantee Bumper Harvests Every Year in the Steppe and Forest-Steppe Zones of the European Part of the Soviet Union," issued on October 20, 1948, has won the great praise of the working people and has aroused new upsurges of labor and politics everywhere. The Ministry of Forestry and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences have begun to organize exploration and draft technical plans for planting state-owned forest shelterbelts. The most intensive planting work will begin in the spring of 1949, and 94 forest areas will be involved in the planting of state-owned forest shelterbelts. The various scientific research institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences have prepared materials on soil and climate conditions in each region for planting state-owned forest shelterbelts. In preparation for planting the network of state-owned large forest shelterbelts, the Ministry of Forestry has estimated all the forests in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union. In these regions of the Soviet Union, there are 2,242,000 hectares of forest (each hectare is equal to 16 mu in China). In 1948, collective and state farms and forest areas in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union planted a total of 198,900 hectares of protective forests, exceeding the plan by 3.6 percent. These state-owned and collective farms have prepared 269,500 hectares of land for afforestation in 1949, making it possible to complete the entire afforestation plan for 1949 in the spring. In the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the Soviet Union, collective farms have formed more than 20,000 afforestation teams, of which 760 afforestation team leaders will graduate from short-term training courses in the autumn and winter of 1948, and they will carry out afforestation work in collective and state-owned farms. Agricultural schools will also train 7,200 agricultural-forestry improvers. The report pointed out that in order to utilize local water resources and develop irrigation on a large scale, collective farms in the steppe and forest-steppe regions of the European part of the Soviet Union built more than 2,800 ponds and reservoirs in 1948. According to the plan, 4,100 new ponds and reservoirs will be built on collective farms in 1949. Forest protection stations have been equipped with a large number of special machines, and a large number of machines will continue to be installed in 1949. The report concludes that a Central Committee for Planting Forest Shelterbelts has been specially established under the Council of Ministers to supervise and control the implementation of the plan.
    The Truth Daily published an editorial on this saying: The materials published in the report once again prove the strength and power of the Soviet system and the great superiority of the socialist economy. The whole world sees once again that the words and deeds of the Bolsheviks are always consistent. The whole world was shocked yesterday by the greatness of the plan, and today it is amazed by the implementation of the plan.

　　征服自然、保证年年丰收！
  　苏联创建森林防护带
    科学院加紧技术研究大批专家受训完毕
    【新华社陕北六日电】苏联创建森林防护带、改造自然、保证年年丰收的伟大计划，正以社会主义国家所特有的惊人魄力进行中。据塔斯社报导：苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央于一九四八年十二月三十日发表了该计划实施情形的报告。该报告指出：政府与党一九四八年十月廿日发布的“关于创造森林防护带、实行农作物与牧草轮种制、建造池塘和蓄水池，保证苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带年年丰收的计划”，已博得劳动人民的极大赞许，到处激起劳动与政治的新热潮。森林部与农业科学院已开始组织探勘并草拟植造国有森林防护带的技术计划。一九四九年春天将开始最紧张的植造工作，九十四处森林区将卷入国有森林防护带的植造工作。苏联科学院各科学研究所已准备了植造国有森林防护带的每个地区的土壤与气候情况的材料。森林部在植造国有大森林防护带网的准备工作中，已将苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地区的一切森林作了估计。在苏联这些地区中，有森林二百二十四万二千公顷（每一公顷合中国十六亩）。一九四八年中，苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地区的集体与国营农场及森林区已种植了防护森林共达十九万八千九百公顷，超过计划百分之三点六。这些国营与集体农场已为一九四九年造林准备了二十六万九千五百公顷的土地，这使得在春季完成一九四九年全年的造林计划，成为可能。在苏联的草原与森林草原地区，集体农场已组成二万余造林队，其中七百六十名造林队的领队将在一九四八年秋冬时期从短期训练班毕业，他们将在集体与国营农场进行造林工作。农业学校亦将训练七千二百名农业——森林改良者。报告指出：为了利用各地水力，大规模发展灌溉、苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地区的集体农场一九四八年已建造了二千八百多个池塘与蓄水池。按照计划，一九四九年将在集体农场建造四千一百个新池塘和蓄水池。护林站已装备有大量的特备的机器，一九四九年一年中将继续装配大量机器。该报告结语称：在部长会议之下特设植造森林防护带中央委员会，以监督并管制计划的执行。
    真理报为此发表社论称：报告所发表的材料，再度证明苏维埃制度的力量与威力、社会主义经济的巨大优越性。全世界再度看到：布尔什维克的言行永远是一致的。全世界昨天为计划的伟大性而震动，今天则为计划之实施而吃惊。
