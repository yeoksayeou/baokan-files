　　People of Central Hebei Brave the Cold to Break Ice on Rivers
　　Ensuring Smooth Transportation for the Battlefield
　　[Central Hebei Dispatch] The people along the Daqing River, Ziya River, and the Grand Canal, bravely broke the ice and overcame natural difficulties, ensuring smooth wartime shipping. Now, the Daqing River route, extending over a hundred miles from Duancun in Baiyangdian in the west to Xinzhen in the east, has resumed winter shipping. The aforementioned rivers had frozen and ceased operations as early as December 20th of last year. In the past, during the icebound season, only small-scale ice sled transportation was possible; but today, in order to support the large-scale war, it is necessary to overcome nature and open up a large-scale river transportation route. According to the habits of the residents along the river, they used to "open pits" (i.e., break the ice to prevent freezing) in winter for fishing and ferrying, but they had never seen ships sailing through the ice. However, the Communist Party, relying closely on the people, was able to achieve this. On January 5th, the experiment was first successfully carried out in some sections of the Daqing River, which immediately inspired people from all walks of life to participate. Upon hearing the news of ice-breaking and ship navigation on the evening of the 7th, three to four hundred young people from Zaolinzhuang to Xungezhuang (33 miles) in Renqiu County quickly picked up ice picks and wooden hammers and stepped onto the frozen river as if they had received a combat mission. They said, "If the army can capture Tianjin and Beiping, can't we open the ice river?" Where the ice was thick, they formed two teams to "encircle and annihilate" it; where the ice was thin, they used boats and ice picks to ram it. The separated ice blocks were pushed one by one to the bottom of the water, pushing forward and squeezing eastward. After continuous day-by-day efforts, what was yesterday a frozen river is today a river with rolling waves. In order to complete the arduous task of breaking through the Ziya River and the Grand Canal, the Eighth Special District appointed the county heads of Qing County and Dacheng County as the chief commanders for ice breaking. The masses within fifteen miles along the river used icebreakers and ice picks to break the ice. When the 65-mile ice river from Wangkou to Ziyazhen was broken by 2,800 laborers on the 10th, people joyfully said, "This is truly a groundbreaking event! In the past, the Japanese used icebreakers but failed, but we have broken through it!" On the Ziya River from Wangkou to Liugezhuang, and on the Grand Canal from Cang County to Jinghai, the sound of intense ice-breaking is ringing out. At the section from Baiyangdian to Tongkou to Tiaocun, a 500-member ice-breaking team and a 280-member ice-pulling team have been assembled and started work on the 14th, and it is expected that the navigation will be cleared in one day. As of the 13th, the river route from Duancun in Baiyangdian in the west to Xinzhen in the east, a distance of over a hundred miles, has been opened to shipping. On the 11th and 12th, a total of 38 ships carrying grain traveled east. Large ships carried 100,000 catties, and small ships carried 30,000 catties. The carrying capacity of one large ship is equivalent to 142 double-horse-drawn carts, and the carrying capacity of one small ship is equivalent to 42 double-horse-drawn carts. If river transportation is restored on all rivers, the transportation capacity will be greatly increased. Now, the people along the Daqing River are using small boats, pulling ropes day and night to impact the river water.

　　冀中人民冒寒砸冰河
  　使战地船运畅通无阻
    【冀中电】大清河、子牙河、运河沿岸人民，奋勇砸冰，战胜自然困难，使战时船运畅通。现在西起白洋淀的端村，东至新镇百余里的大清河路，已恢复冬季船运。按上述各河，早于去年十二月二十号即已先后冻结停运。过去在封河季节，只能做小型冰床运输；处在支持大规模战争的今天，必须战胜自然，开辟规模宏大的河运路线。根据沿河居民习惯，曾在冬季“开坑”（即把冰砸开不让冻结）捕鱼摆渡，从未见过冲破冰封的船只行驶。但共产党紧紧的依靠了人民，竟能实现。一月五号，首在大清河部分地段试验成功，旋即鼓舞起各阶层人民参加。任邱县枣林庄至荀各庄（三十三里）的沿河群众，于七号晚上听到砸冰行船的消息，三、四百个青壮年，象接受了战斗任务一样，迅速的拿起了凌枪、木榔头踏上冰河。他们说：“军队能攻下天津、北平，咱们还不能打开冰河？”冰厚的地方，他们排成两队“围歼”；冰薄的地方用船及凌枪冲撞。分裂开的冰块，一块块的被逐到水底，前拥后挤的推向东去。经连续一天一天的努力，昨天还是冰冻河封，今天却已浪花翻滚。八专区为了完成砸通子牙河、运河的艰巨任务，由青县、大城两县长分任砸冰总指挥。沿河十五里内的群众使用着破冰船、凌枪砸冰。当十号王口到子牙镇六十五里的冰河被二千八百个民工砸开后，人们欢欣的说：“真是开天辟地的大事！过去日本人用破冰船都没有成功，倒被咱们砸通了！”子牙河经王口到刘各庄，运河从沧县到静海，正响着激烈的砸冰声。白洋淀至同口到窕村段，已集结砸冰队五百人，拉冰队二百八十人，已于十四日动工，一天可望砸通行船。截至十三日，西起白洋淀的端村，东至新镇百余里的河路已通船。十一、二两日共有三十八只船载粮东行。大船载重十万斤，小船载重三万斤。一只大船载重量可抵双套大车一百四十二辆，一只小船载重量可抵双套大车四十二辆。如各河恢复船运，运输力当更大大提高。现在大清河的沿岸人民，正以小船，人拉檩条日以继夜的冲击着河水。
