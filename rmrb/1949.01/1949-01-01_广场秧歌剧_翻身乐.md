Crowd: Let's dance a big Yangko,
Lead: One person sings,
Crowd: Ten thousand people sing in harmony,
Together: The poor are liberated and celebrating!
Crowd: In the first lunar month, the weather is cold and the snow hasn't melted, the suffering people have no home like birds have no nest; a sudden thunderclap echoes through the sky, the flames of struggle are ten thousand feet high!
In the second lunar month, the grass returns to life, the suffering people unite and turn over; break the iron chains of feudalism, the Communist Party leads us.
In the third lunar month, the spring breeze blows all over the land, the ancient trees bloom after a thousand years.
In the fourth lunar month, the crops grow well, deep plowing and careful cultivation, hoeing more seedlings.
The mutual aid organization is good, many people gather firewood and the flames are high.
The apricot eyes ripen and the elm money turns yellow, every household is busy cutting wheat, the sun rises on the east mountain and sets on the west mountain, the days in May are long and we don't feel tired.
In the sixth lunar month, the sun is scorching hot, the crops are afraid of drought, plan well for saving and preparing for famine, not afraid of drought or flood.
In the seventh lunar month, the sorghum grows tall, the green sorghum stalks hold up the big red tassels, working during the day and holding meetings at night, we're not afraid of hard work,
In the eighth and ninth lunar months, it's the busy farming season, millet and grain are piled on the threshing floor, waving our hands and using wooden shovels, our faces are full of smiles, working hard for ourselves,
Picking cotton, white and strong, harvesting grain, the ears are long, storing grain in bins for the future, spinning cotton to sew clothes,
In the tenth lunar month, a little spring comes, we voluntarily sign up to join the army, put down our hoes and carry our guns, and go to the front line to fight the enemy.
In the eleventh lunar month, the farming is slack and the weather turns cold, developing large-scale winter production, the men go out to transport goods, the women weave cloth and spin thread.
In the twelfth lunar month, it's the first year of liberation, celebrating the New Year with excitement, thanks to the Communist Party for our liberation, Chairman Mao's kindness is as great as the sky!
Lead: Chairman Mao's kindness is as great as the sky,
Crowd: Let's give him New Year's greetings!
Lead: The joy of liberation,
Crowd: Can't be sung enough,
Together: The poor are liberated for ten thousand years, the poor are liberated for ten thousand years!

(The crowd dances in a five-pointed star, surrounding the portrait of Chairman Mao, excited and joyous...)
