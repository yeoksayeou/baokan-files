　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS, Pyongyang, 11th: The armed struggle of South Korean soldiers and officers against the Syngman Rhee puppet regime is escalating. In Jeolla Namdo and other areas of southwestern South Korea, they are launching offensives and inflicting heavy casualties on the police. Several days ago, they clashed with 200 policemen. In Gwangju, Jeolla Namdo, they routed a strong police force. They have gained an advantage in Jeolla Namdo and Jeolla Bukdo. Enraged by their setbacks, the police are now retaliating against the villagers.

    The Current Situation of the South Korean People's Armed Struggle

    The policy of U.S. imperialism to forcibly turn South Korea into a colony has led to the collapse of the South Korean economy. The number of unemployed workers is close to three million, and farmers are groaning under the oppression of landlords as they did during the Japanese rule. The fate of starvation threatens every urban and rural working person. In this situation, the South Korean people, with their tradition of revolutionary struggle, have had no choice but to take up arms and fight for independence and liberation when their demands for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the implementation of democracy and land reform through peaceful means could not be achieved.

    The South Korean people's armed struggle originated in Jeju Island and has now spread to Jeolla Namdo, Jeolla Bukdo in southwestern South Korea, and Gyeongsang Bukdo in southeastern South Korea. In early October 1948, armed uprisings of the people occurred in Jeju Island and the nearby Seogwipo Island. The Syngman Rhee "government" sent more than 40 students from the officers' training corps to Jeju and ordered the 14th Regiment of the Army Garrison Force of Oh Dong-gi, stationed in Yeosu on the southeastern coast of South Korea, to send a team to Jeju to suppress the uprising. However, at this juncture, the 14th Regiment, with 2,400 men, resisted the order to develop Jeju in opposition to suppressing the uprising people, and launched an uprising on the evening of October 19. The students of the officers' training corps also rose up in response. The insurgents used the slogan of opposing the Syngman Rhee puppet government. They burned down the Yeosu police station, seized weapons from the armory, and armed the people on the spot. After occupying Yeosu, the insurgents, under the command of Lieutenant Kim Ji-hoe, advanced northwest along the railway line, captured Suncheon, and the garrison in Suncheon also joined the uprising. The force then grew to 4,000 men. At that time, the uprising troops organized a soldiers' command and a citizens' command, and the flag of the Korean People's Republic was hung everywhere. After October 21, the uprising troops successively captured Gwangyang to the east of Suncheon and Boseong and Jangheung to the southwest of Suncheon and other cities on the railway line. At the same time, two companies of the 4th Regiment stationed in Gwangju, northwest of Suncheon, also raised the banner of uprising.

    On October 25 and 26, the Yeosu uprising army actively withdrew from Suncheon, Gwangyang, and Yeosu, dispersed its main force, and attacked Gurye north of Suncheon and Dolsan Island south of Yeosu. In early November, one route of the uprising army advanced north, passing through Namwon and Gurye, occupied Mount Jiri as a base, and attacked Hamyang; another route developed from Boseong and Goheung towards Jangheung and Gangjin. During the northward advance, the uprising army combined with local armed forces and received widespread support from the masses. They attacked police stations, occupied armories, and disrupted transportation and communication. They replenished themselves with the captured weapons and ammunition, and used warships to transport some weapons and ammunition to aid the Jeju Island People's Army. On November 2, half a regiment of the 4th Regiment stationed in Naju, western Jeolla Namdo, near the Yellow Sea, also revolted, and they joined the western forces of the Yeosu uprising army to the south. On the same day, the entire 6th Regiment stationed in Daegu, Gyeongsang Bukdo, also revolted. They killed reactionary officers and mostly entered the area of Chilgok, Deokseong, and Gimcheon (west of Daegu). By early December, the flames of the Yeosu uprising had spread throughout the southern half of South Korea.

    The large-scale armed uprising had thrown U.S. imperialism and its running dog Syngman Rhee government into disarray. The pseudo-Premier Lee Bum-suk, the pseudo-Chief of Staff, and the pseudo-Commander-in-Chief of the Army all personally went to suppress it. As of November 3, they had dispatched eight of the fifteen regiments of the South Korean puppet army. The puppet government had also dismantled the northbound railway in Jeolla Namdo in an attempt to prevent the spread of the uprising. In addition to supplying the puppet government with airplanes and jeeps, the U.S. imperialists directly participated in the suppression of the insurgents. Two U.S. warships shelled Yeosu. They used flamethrowers, killing thousands of people, and burning down both old and new Yeosu. In Daegu, the U.S. military also helped with the suppression. Now, the Americans dare not trust the Army Garrison Force. In addition to ordering the Syngman Rhee government to fully expose the so-called "impure elements" in the Army Garrison Force, they are also increasing police power and organizing civilian defense corps in a vain attempt to maintain their extremely unstable rule in South Korea.

　　南鲜人民武装斗争益高涨
  　起义部队正在西南部实行进攻
  　美帝及其走狗李承晚政府手忙脚乱
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社平壤十一日讯：南朝鲜军队官兵反抗李承晚傀儡政权的武装斗争，正日益高涨中。在南朝鲜西南部的全罗南道及其他地区，他们正在实行进攻，并予警察以重创。数日以前，他们曾与二百名警察发生冲突。在全罗南道的光州，他们击溃了强大的警察队。在全罗南道与全罗北道，他们已占优势。因挫败而恼羞成怒的警察，现正向村民进行报复。
    南鲜人民武装斗争现势
    美帝国主义强把南朝鲜变为殖民地的政策，已使南朝鲜的经济陷于崩溃之中，工人失业者已近三百万，农民象日本统治时代一样呻吟于地主的压迫之下，饥饿待毙的命运威胁着每一个城乡的劳动人民。在这种情形下，富有革命斗争传统的南朝鲜人民，当用和平手段要求美军撤退和实施民主与土地改革的目的无法达到时，就不得不手执武器地起来为争取独立与解放而斗争。
    南朝鲜人民的武装斗争，发轫于济州岛，迄今已遍及南朝鲜西南部的全罗南道、全罗北道及东南部的庆尚北道。一九四八年十月初，济州岛及其附近的西基浦岛等地发生人民武装起义。李承晚“政府”派士官团学生四十余人赴济州，并令驻扎南朝鲜东南海滨之丽水的陆军警备队吴东启部第十四联队派队至济州镇压。但是，当此时机，二千四百人的第十四联队因反对镇压起义人民而抗拒开发济州的命令，并于十月十九日晚开始起义。士官团学生亦起而响应。起义者以反对李承晚傀儡政府为口号。他们焚烧了丽水警察所，夺取了兵械库的武器，并就地武装了人民。起义者占领丽水以后，在金之恢中尉指挥下，沿铁路线向西北推进，攻占顺天，顺天驻军亦参加起义，队伍遂发展至四千人。道时，起义部队组织了士兵司令部及市民司令部，并遍悬朝鲜人民共和国国旗。十月二十一日以后，起义部队又相继攻占顺天以东之光阳及顺天西南之宝城、长兴等铁路线上城市。与此同时，驻于顺天西北之光州的第四联队的两个中队亦揭起义旗。
    十月二十五日、二十六日，丽水起义军主动撤出顺天、光阳与丽水，并将主力散开，进攻顺天以北之求礼及丽水以南之突山岛地。十一月初，起义军一路北进，经南原、求礼，占领智异山为根据地，并向咸阳进击；另一路由宝城、高兴方面向长兴、康津发展。起义军在北进中，沿途与地方武装结合，并获得群众多方支持，他们袭击警察所，占领兵械库，破坏交通电讯。他们既以夺获的武器弹药充实自己，又以舰艇载运一部分武器弹药援助济州岛人民军。十一月二日，驻于全罗南道西部、靠近黄海之罗州的第四联队半个联队亦起义了，他们向南与丽水起义军之西路部队会合。在同一天，驻于庆尚北道之大邱的第六联队又全部起义，他们杀死了反动军官，并大部进入漆谷、德成、金泉（在大邱之西）一带。至十二月初，丽水起义的烽火，遂已燃遍南朝鲜的南半部。
    声势浩大的武装起义，曾使美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚政府手忙脚乱。伪总理李范＠、伪参谋总长、伪陆军总司令等均亲自出马镇压。截至十一月三日止，他们出动了南朝鲜全部十五个联队伪军中的八个联队。伪政府并已将全罗南道之北行铁道拆毁，企图阻止起义之蔓延。美帝国主义者除供给傀儡政府飞机、吉普车外，并直接参加了对起义者的镇压。美舰两艘向丽水开炮，他们使用了火焰喷射器，数千人民被杀死，新旧丽水亦被他们烧光。在大邱，美军亦帮助了镇压。现在，美国人已不敢信任陆军警备队，他们除命令李承晚政府全力检举陆军警备队中的所谓“不纯分子”外，并正提高警察权，编制民保团，妄图维持其在南朝鲜的极其不稳的统治。
