　　Xiyang and Other Counties Inspect Winter Production
  　Some Areas Exceed Plans
  　Please Inspect According to Plan in All Areas
    Current Major Shortcomings
  　County and District Leadership Not Yet Thorough; Land Reform and Production Not Well Integrated
    [Taihang Telegram] Taihang's four counties, Licheng, Xiyang, Xingtai, and Lincheng, have recently inspected the previous stage of winter production. They unanimously believe that the masses have great enthusiasm for production this winter, and "organized" production is better than in previous years, resulting in significant production achievements. Some areas have already achieved their planned targets (the portion that should be completed in this stage). The main problems are that the county and district leadership has not handled the integration of the end of land reform and production well (Licheng has done better), and some county and district cadres are not thorough enough, which has had some impact on winter production. This is specifically reflected in the following aspects. In terms of production achievements: Statistics from 141 villages in Licheng show that transportation earned over 71 million Jibi currency in January; 229 workshops earned over 83 million yuan. Statistics from five districts show that over 4.23 million catties of firewood were collected, over 30,000 catties of cotton were spun by women, and over 13,000 catties of cloth have been woven. Statistics from nine villages in the fifth district of Lincheng show that the transportation team has 266 laborers and 125 animals. Preliminary calculations show that they have earned over 6.2 million yuan. The iron industry in Xiyang originally planned to develop 11 daohao (a daohao is a furnace) in the entire county this winter. After half a month of effort, it has increased from seven to 22, exceeding the planned target. The Shiguo Iron Factory has created gray cast iron, opening up a path for the development of the iron industry in Xiyang. The coal industry has also developed rapidly: there are currently 56 coal kilns, of which 43 are newly opened this winter. There are already eight crucible kilns (buckets for firing bowls and smelting iron). This production has absorbed most of the full and semi-labor force and animal power in 50 villages. Statistics from 35 villages show that they have earned over 71 million yuan in over 50 days. In terms of agricultural preparation, the accumulation of manure is also actively underway. Twenty-eight people in Baiyangling Village have already accumulated 360 zhang (over two zhang high). The Wu Jilai group (10 households) in Jingyang Village has accumulated over 1,900 loads of grass manure, and five old men in Dajing Village have collected over 110 dan of manure. In order to get rich, the masses are carrying out construction in all aspects. Statistics from ten villages in the fifth district of Xingtai show that 1,660 animals have been bought back this winter. More than 360 houses have been built or repaired in the four villages of Baifanshi, Dongyu, etc. A total of 60 houses have been built and 81 earth kilns have been repaired in the ten villages of Shanye, etc. in Licheng. Twenty-six animals have been bought back in the eighteen villages of Huoxiangdao, etc. Twenty-two carts have been bought back in the two villages of Xiaokou and Yaohuangxu (organized together). Some cooperatives have initially become the core of organizing the masses for winter production, reflecting the achievements of the village and community rectification before autumn. Most of the 153 cooperatives in Licheng that were rectified before winter production have played a role in organizing mass production. For example, the Xiaogou Cooperative ordered 50,000 catties of brambles, 1,000 hoe handles, and 1,500 hammer handles from the Lucheng Coal Mine. It immediately mobilized the masses to go to the mountains to cut mountain products. Now more than 10,000 catties of strips have been cut, and enough hoe handles and hammer handles have been obtained, which can earn a total of 4.5 million yuan. The head of the Dianshang Village Cooperative in Lincheng personally led four people to transport goods and make profits, attracting the masses to gradually participate. His transportation team has now expanded to 37 people and 20 animals. Only four animals in the village have not participated. The organizational method of the team is to uniformly solicit business and uniformly allocate labor and animal power. Living expenses are distributed from the team to the group, and from the group to the household. If it is not enough to transport all the goods at once, they take turns. Because of mutual aid, one person can drive two or three animals, saving labor for collecting firewood. The county and district federations of Xingtai and Xiyang, as well as some district federations, are also gradually connecting with the masses in organizing winter production. The reason why this stage of production can be done well is primarily because the thinking of the broad masses has truly stabilized. This is the result of ending land reform, conducting policy education, education on getting rich, and conducting future education. Many party members have played a leading and promoting role. Secondly, some county and district cadres have begun to lead the masses based on specific circumstances, overcoming the formalistic style of "doing whatever is asked" in the past. The main problem with winter production at present is still that the leadership of the county and district cannot keep up with the demands of the masses. This is manifested in: 1. The villages that have finished land reform cannot be integrated with production. One is that the work arrangement is improper, forming each taking care of its own. The other is that production and land reform are considered two tasks. Production is regular, and the end of land reform is a blitz. Emphasis is placed on ending land reform and then focusing on winter production in these villages. Therefore, emphasis is placed on ending land reform, and leadership of winter production is relaxed. 2. Some district and county cadres who specifically lead production still cannot lead in a concrete way. They either stay in one village and do not move, or they run around and cannot play a leading role. They do not know how to use typical examples, and they do not know how to mobilize the masses through branches and various organizational structures. Therefore, problems cannot be discovered in time. For example, in some villages in the seventh district of Xiyang, the work exchange accounts from before autumn have not been cleared, affecting mutual aid production, but the district leadership has not discovered this in time. Good experiences cannot be summarized, improved, and disseminated in time: for example, the integration of agriculture and sideline industries in the Bazhou Village Cooperative and the Yaotou Village in the first district of Xiyang is said to be very good, but the county and district leadership does not know how good it is and cannot disseminate it. Many villages in Xingtai have seen many natural organizational forms of the masses, but they lack leadership and improvement. This inspection is like a mirror reflecting the overall picture of winter production in each county, which is beneficial to promoting future production. Xiyang emphasizes that county and district cadres should first recognize that land reform and production must be combined and that policy education on "production and getting rich" must be implemented for the masses. For village leadership, there should be a focus on going deep into one village and mobilizing the masses through village cadres, labor heroes, and activists. Licheng decided that 3/5 of the cadres would combine production with issuing land certificates and carrying out party rectification, while the remaining cadres would all lead winter production.

　　昔阳等县检查冬季生产
  　部分地区超过计划
  　请各地按计划进行检查
    目前主要缺点
  　县区领导还不深入　土改生产没结合好
    【太行电】太行黎城、昔阳、邢台、临城等四县均于最近检查了前段冬季生产，一致认为今冬群众生产劲头很大，“组织起来”生产也较往年要好，因而生产成绩很大。有些地方已实现了预定的计划（这一段应完成之部）。存在的问题，主要是县区领导上对结束土改与生产的结合处理得不好（黎城做的较好），及一些县区干部不够深入，因而使冬季生产受到一些影响。具体表现在以下几方面。从生产成绩来看：黎城一百四十一个村统计，一月运输赚冀钞七千一百余万元；作坊二百二十九座，赚洋八千三百余万元。五个区统计，打柴四百廿三万余斤，妇女纺花三万余斤，已织成布一万三千余斤。临城五区九个村统计，参加运输队的人力有二百六十六人，牲口一百廿五头，初步计算，已获利六百廿余万元。昔阳铁业生产，原计划是今冬全县要发展十一道壕（一道壕即是一座熔炉），经过半月努力，已由七道增至二十二道，超过了预订计划。石国铁厂创造了灰生铁，给昔阳铁业的发展开辟了一条道路。煤业也迅速发展：现有煤窑五十六座，其中今冬新开的即有四十三座。坩（烧碗炼铁用的桶）窑已有八座。这些生产，吸收了五十个村的大部全半劳力及畜力。卅五个村统计，五十多天已赚洋七千一百余万元。在农业准备工作上，垒＠积肥也积极进行。白羊岭村廿八人已垒＠三百六十丈（两丈多高）。静阳村武计来组（十户）已积草肥一千九百余驮，达井村五个老汉已拾粪一百一十余担。群众为了发家致富，从各方面进行着建设。邢台五区十个村统计，今冬已买回牲口一千六百六十头。白凡石、东峪等四村，入冬已修盖房屋三百六十多间。黎城善业等十个村，入冬共盖房六十间，修理土窑八十一孔。火巷道等十八个村已买回牲口廿六头。小口、要黄须两村买回大车廿二辆（组织起来）。部分合作社初步地成了组织群众冬季生产的核心，体现了秋前整顿村社的成绩。黎城冬产前整顿过的一百五十三个合作社，绝大部分起了组织群众生产的作用。如小沟合作社到潞城煤窑上订卖荆条五万斤，镢把一千根，锤把一千五百根，回来即发动群众上山砍山货，现已割条一万余斤，镢把、锤把已弄够了，共可赚洋四百五十万元。临城店上村合作社社长亲自领导四人运输得利，吸引群众逐渐参加，他的运输队现已扩大到卅七人，牲口廿头，全村仅四个牲口未参加。该队的组织办法，是统一揽脚，统一调剂劳畜力，有了生活由队分到组，由组分到户。如不够全体运时，就轮着去。由于互助起来一人能赶两三个牲口，省出劳力去打柴。邢台、昔阳两县县联社及部分区联社，也在组织群众冬季生产中逐渐与群众联系起来。这段生产所以能够搞的好，首先是广大群众的思想真正安定了。这是经过结束土改、进行政策教育、发家致富教育与进行前途教育的结果。不少党员都起了带头与推动作用。其次是部分县区干部开始做到了根据具体情况去领导群众，克服了过去“要干啥都干啥”的形式主义作风。目前冬季生产的主要问题，仍然是县区领导赶不上群众要求。这表现在：一、结束土改村与生产结合不起来。其中一种是工作安排上欠妥，形成各顾各。一种是认为生产与土改是两个任务，生产是经常的，结束土改是突击性的，搞好结束土改再全力搞冬产。因而在这类村中是重视结束土改，放松了领导冬季生产。二、一些专门领导生产的区、县干部还不会具体领导。不是钻在一个村子里不动，便是跑来跑去起不了领导作用：不会运用典型，不会通过支部及各种组织机构去发动群众，因而有问题不能及时发现。如昔阳七区有些村秋前参战的变工帐还未清理，影响互助生产，区领导上却没及时发现。有好的经验也不能及时概括提高与传播：如昔阳一区巴州村合作社与窑头村的农副结合听说都很好，但究竟怎样好，县区领导上都不了解，无法传播。邢台许多村出现了好多群众自然的组织形式，就是缺乏领导与提高。这次检查，对各该县冬产的全貌是照了一下镜子，这对于推动今后生产是有好处的。昔阳强调县区干部首先应认识土改与生产必须结合起来，并要贯彻对群众“生产发家”的政策教育。对于村的领导，要有重点的深入在一个村里，通过村干劳英与积极分子去发动群众。黎城决定以五分之三的干部去结合生产发土地证与进行整党外，其余干部全部去领导冬季生产。
