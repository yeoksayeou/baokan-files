Achievements in Military Work in Taihang Last Year
    Wang Yuanfen

    Looking back at our military work in 1948, under the correct leadership of the North China Military Region and the Regional Party Committee, relying on the active efforts of all cadres and the heroic combat of all commanders and fighters, we achieved considerable accomplishments.

    Building Armed Forces and Training Cadres

    (1) In terms of troop construction, following the southward expedition of the × Column last autumn, according to the Central Committee's second-year strategic policy and the needs of the inland operation mission, the urgent task placed before the military region was to vigorously build up armed forces. For example, the ×× Column was formed this spring, which greatly contributed to annihilating the enemy's active forces in large numbers in inland operations, training and developing into a new main force column, and contributing to the people's liberation cause. At this point, the military region, according to the new quota and the combat situation of each sub-district, further proposed to continue building new armed forces in order to independently maintain the combat situation in our region. Since this task was put forward, all localities have made their best efforts, so the entire region has made significant achievements in building armed forces. For example, the original troops of the Second Military Sub-district, after the summer offensive, were assigned to the Jinzhong Military Region and have since formed a relatively substantial regular brigade. The troops of the Fourth Military Sub-district, because they were upgraded more than other sub-districts in the past, although the remaining troops in the sub-district had a weak foundation, finally overcame the various difficulties encountered in the struggle due to the heroic struggle over the years, making the troops change from weak to strong. In the autumn offensive, the troops transitioned from decentralized to centralized operations and were upgraded to regular troops, which should be regarded as supreme glory. The troops of the Fifth Military Sub-district not only strengthened and filled the original × backbone regiments, making them the backbone of persistent struggle, but also formed × independent regiments this autumn. The Tang, Qi, Ji, and Xin independent battalions have also been filled and strengthened. This laid a solid foundation for the future development and further expansion of the troops. With the development and expansion of the troops, the training and promotion of cadres have also made significant achievements. Not only have they solved the difficulties in cadres in this region, but also a large number of cadres have been transferred to other regions and military universities for study. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 842 military cadres at all levels were trained and promoted, including 10 regiment-level cadres, 70 battalion-level cadres, 234 company-level cadres, and 510 platoon-level cadres; a total of 118 military cadres at all levels were transferred to other regions and military universities for study. In order to welcome the liberation of Pingjin and Taiyuan, the military region also formed a prisoner training institution for the North China Military Region, with a "skeleton" of three regiments, equipped with military and political cadres at all levels from brigade to platoon.

    Troop Tactics and Techniques Significantly Improved

    (2) In terms of training, after our region's troops were continuously upgraded, new soldiers accounted for 10% of each backbone regiment in each sub-district, while independent battalions, district cadre teams, etc. accounted for more than 90%. The troops lacked the foundation of military technology and tactical literacy. Most of the military cadres below the company level were newly promoted, so their combat command and training capabilities were very poor. In response to the above situation, our training policy was put forward, focusing on shooting, grenade throwing, and blasting, supplemented by comprehensive exercises of individual combat, in order to further improve on different foundations. This work has also achieved considerable results. The backbone regiments of each sub-district have completed an average of 95 days of training time, and although county brigades, independent battalions, etc. are mainly engaged in war missions, they have also strived to complete 95 days of training. As a result, the troops' technical and tactical literacy has been significantly improved. After the troops underwent live ammunition shooting, they shot at a 1-meter ten-ring target at a distance of 100 meters, with an average of more than 15 rings and 80% total hits, especially in actual combat, reducing the average number of bullets hitting an enemy from over 60 in the past to 25 to 20. The grenade throwing distance increased from an average of 28 meters to 35 meters. The blasting power has also been greatly enhanced. Secondly, in terms of the training and improvement of cadres, the military region's training regiment held a total of four sessions, with a total of 421 military cadres below the company level. The Fourth and Fifth Military Sub-districts held a total of eight sessions, with a total of 712 cadres below the company level. This has played a great role in promoting the technical and tactical improvement of the troops.

    Complete Liberation of the Second and Fourth Military Sub-districts

    (3) In terms of combat, based on the Central Committee's second-year strategic policy, the task of inland operations, and the situation in this region, the combat guidance throughout the year focused on developing guerrilla warfare and struggles to protect food and manpower; based on this, combined with the situation and tasks of each period, different specific guidance was given. From January to April, the guidance focused on guerrilla warfare to resist the enemy's flood-like large-scale grain grabbing and manpower grabbing (such as the Second Military Sub-district) and to oppose the enemy's sudden raids and encirclements (such as the Fourth Military Sub-district). From May to August, the focus was on protecting the summer harvest. The troops of the Second Military Sub-district, under the unified command of a certain army group, concentrated their forces and quickly achieved the liberation of the entire sub-district in the Jinzhong Campaign. From September to December, the focus was on protecting the autumn harvest. In late October, the Fourth and Fifth Military Sub-districts, under the unified command of the ×× Column, cooperated with the Central Plains operations, not only successfully completing the task of protecting the autumn harvest, but also achieving the liberation of the entire territory of the Fourth Military Sub-district. At this point, the remnants of the enemy in northern Henan only have three isolated strongholds left in Anyang, Xinxiang, and Huixian, and the opportunity to completely eliminate the enemy and thoroughly liberate northern Henan is imminent.

    Direction of Efforts in 1949

    In short, our military work, political work, and logistics work have achieved significant results. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, I would like to offer a few suggestions as a direction for common efforts in the new 1949: (1) In order to adapt to the needs of the future situation and tasks, we must vigorously allocate the missing cadres within a limited time and equip cadres at all levels with deputy positions, and strengthen the theoretical, political, military, and cultural study of cadres in service to further improve. (2) Strengthen the regular construction of the troops and further improve the ability to attack fortified positions, improve various regular systems, strictly enforce organizational discipline, and continue to train and improve the training and combat command capabilities of military cadres at all levels in service. Further strengthen the training of troops to improve technical and tactical literacy and develop the habit of continuous operations. (3) With the rapidly developing and victorious situation across the country, I hope that all our staff and all commanders and fighters will make persistent efforts and further prepare ideologically and organizationally to be upgraded to regular troops, prevent some people from having regional and family concepts in their minds, and strive to completely, decisively, and entirely eliminate the remaining enemies in northern Henan, completely liberate all the people of northern Henan, and complete the glorious and great historical task bestowed upon our military region by the Party and the people.

　　太行去年军事工作的成就
    王远芬
    回顾我们一九四八年的军事工作，在华北军区及区党委正确领导下，依靠全体干部积极努力工作，与全体指战员的英勇作战，获得了不少成就。
    建设武装培养干部
    （一）部队建设方面，根据中央第二年战略方针和内线作战任务之需要，继去秋×纵南征后，摆在军区面前的迫切任务，是要用大力建立武装。如在今春又组成了××纵队，这对内线作战大量歼灭敌人的有生力量，培养锻炼成为新的主力纵队，和对人民解放事业的贡献是很大的。至此，军区又根据新的定额及各分区斗争形势，进一步提出继续建设新的武装，以期独立的坚持我区斗争局面。自这个任务提出后，各地均作了最大努力，所以全区在建设武装方面，是有了显著成绩的。如原二分区的部队，经夏季攻势，该分区划归晋中军区，后已组成一个较充实的正规旅。四分区的部队，由于过去较其他分区升级的要多，虽留在分区的部队基础很弱，但年来由于英勇斗争的结果，终于克服在斗争中所遇到的种种困难，使部队由弱变强。在秋季攻势中，部队由分散过渡到集中的作战，并升级为正规军，这应引为无尚光荣。五分区的部队不仅壮大与充实了原来的×个基干团，使之成为坚持斗争的骨干，而且在今秋又组成了×个独立团。汤、淇、汲、新等独立营亦有了充实与加强。这给未来部队的发展和更加壮大上打下了有力的基础。随着部队的发展和壮大，对干部的培养和提拔上也是有其显著成绩的。不仅解决了本区干部中的困难，而且调他区及调军大学习的干部为数很多，据不完全统计，培养与提拔的各级军事干部，计有团干十、营干七十、连干二百三十四、排干五百一十，合计八百四十二名；调他区与军大学习的各级军事干部，共计一百一十八名。为迎接平津、太原之解放，军区又给华北军区组成了一个俘训的机构，下辖三个团的“架子”，配备齐各旅至排的各级军政干部。
    部队战术与技术显著提高
    （二）训练方面，我区部队不断升级后，各分区的每一基干团，新战士占百分之十，而独立营、区干队等则在百分之九十以上。部队的军事技术与战术素养是缺乏基础的。关于连以下各级军事干部，大多数是新提拔的，因此对作战指挥及训练能力是很差的。针对上述情况，提出了我们的训练方针，以射击投弹爆破为主，辅以单个战斗的综合演习，以期在不同的基础上，更加提高一步。这一工作也获得了不少的成绩。各分区基干团平均完成了九十五天的训练时间，县大队，独立营等虽以战争任务为主，但亦争取完成了九十五天的训练。因而使部队的技术和战术素养有显著的提高。经过实弹射击的部队，在一百公尺的距离上射击一公尺的十环靶，平均都在十五环以上全部命中百分之八十，特别表现在实战中，以过去平均六十发子弹以上命中一敌，进而减至二十五至二十发。投弹投远由过去平均二十八米增加到三十五米。爆破力量亦大大增强。其次是对干部的培养与提高方面，军区教导团，共开办了四期，计连以下军事干部共四百二十一名。四、五分区共开办了八期，计连以下干部共七百一十二名。这对部队技术与战术上的提高是起了很大推动作用的。
    二、四分区全境解放
    （三）作战方面，依据中央第二年的战略方针，和内线作战的任务及本区情况，贯串全年的作战指导，是以发展游击战争和保粮保丁斗争为主；据此结合各时期的情况与任务，又分别不同的具体指导。一至四月指导重点是以游击战争为主，反抗敌人的水漫式的大规模抢粮抓丁（如二分区）及反对敌人突然奔袭包围（如四分区）。五至八月以保卫夏收为主。二分区的部队则在某兵团统一指挥下，集中作战，在晋中战役中很快地获得了全分区解放。九月至十二月以保卫秋收为主，在十月下旬四、五分区均在××纵队统一指挥下，配合中原作战，不仅胜利地完成了保秋收斗争任务，同时四分区全境亦获得了解放。至此，豫北之残敌仅剩下安阳、新乡、辉县等三个孤立据点，完全消灭敌人及彻底解放豫北的时机已迫在眉梢。
    一九四九年努力方向
    总之，我们的军事工作、政治工作、后勤工作成绩是显著的，回顾过去，瞻望将来，仅提供几点意见作为新的一九四九年共同努力方向：（一）为适应今后形势与任务的需要，必须用大力限期配备缺额干部，和配备各级副职干部，并加强在职干部理论的、政治的、军事的、文化的学习，更加提高一步。（二）加强部队的正规建设，和进一步提高攻坚作战能力，健全各种正规制度，严格组织纪律，继续培养与提高在职各级军事干部的训练与作战指挥能力。进一步加强部队的训练以达提高技术与战术素养，养成连续作战的习惯。（三）随着全国急剧发展的胜利形势，尚希我全体工作人员、全体指战员再接再厉，并在思想上组织上要进一步的准备升级为正规军，预防部分人在思想上存在着地域观念和家庭观念，而为彻底的、干脆的、全部消灭豫北残存敌人，完全解放全豫北人民，为完成党和人民所赐予我军区光荣而伟大的历史任务奋斗。
