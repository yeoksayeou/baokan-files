　　【Jidong, 3rd Dispatch】The nationally renowned Tangshan Railway Locomotive Factory, under the active protection of all its employees, was handed over to the democratic government completely undamaged. The locomotive factory is large in scale. Last October, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempted to dismantle the machinery and transport it south, and deceived the workers by saying, "Whoever is willing to go will be given two months' salary," but this was rejected by the workers, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' plot failed. On the 12th of last month, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled the city, most of the workers were coerced into leaving the factory to repair and dig fortifications. Some workers were not in the factory due to it being a Sunday. There were only forty or fifty workers left in the factory. When they heard the news of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' rout, they immediately organized a picket team, locked all the main gates of the factory, and patrolled and stood guard at all key intersections to prevent the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from sabotage. Finally, they successfully protected their factory and handed it over to the democratic government. After the establishment of the Military Control Commission in the city, all the workers actively persisted in their work under the leadership of the Military Control Commission and never stopped production. Before liberation, more than 4,000 workers in the factory had not received their wages for more than a month. The Military Control Commission allocated 50,000 catties of food and 1 billion Changcheng coupons to initially solve the workers' livelihood problems. The factory employees actively supported railway transportation to the Pingjin front. They planned to renovate nine locomotives before the New Year, and the workers automatically proposed to select two locomotives to establish the "New Tangshan" locomotive to celebrate their liberation. This call was immediately enthusiastically responded to by the workers throughout the factory, who put forward the slogan: "We won't celebrate the New Year until we finish the renovation!" "We will renovate the locomotives and enter Beiping to welcome Chairman Mao!" They worked day and night on the renovation. The workers who established the factory overcame the difficulty of lacking parts, and carefully rubbed the boilers, accessories, rockers, connecting rods and other parts that had not been cleaned for more than ten years and had already deteriorated with sandpaper, and then painted them with new paint. Song Jiucheng, a worker on the night shift, worked hard and persevered until noon the next day before taking time to eat, demonstrating a high degree of labor enthusiasm. Under the active rush repairs of the two factory employees, the two "New Tangshan" locomotives and the other seven locomotives were all installed before the New Year's Eve. The "New Tangshan" locomotive, hung with a huge portrait of Chairman Mao, was already running on the Beining Railway line on the first New Year's Day after the liberation of Tangshan.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 31st Dispatch】Tongxian County, forty miles east of Beiping, was liberated by the People's Liberation Army on the 14th. Democratic government personnel immediately entered the city with the army and issued a notice to reassure the people. The city's power plant, electric lights, telephones, tap water, etc. were all intact under the protection of the workers. All the more than 100 employees of the power plant automatically organized a "Factory Protection Committee" when the bandit troops fled, and reported the location where the bandit troops buried landmines to the democratic government when the People's Liberation Army entered the city. The electric light factory began to supply electricity that night. Tap water also began to be supplied on the morning of the 15th. Some of the telephone bureau's workers were forcibly taken away by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the remaining 15 people took on the telephone work for the entire city.

　　唐山机车厂恢复生产
  　工人装修“新唐山号”机车
    通县水电工厂迅速复工
    【冀东三日电】全国闻名的唐山铁路机车厂，在全体员工积极保护下，丝毫未受损害，完好地移交给民主政府。机车厂，规模宏大，去年十月间蒋匪曾企图将机械拆卸南运，并欺骗工人说：“谁愿意去就发给两个月的工资”，但遭到工人的拒绝，蒋匪阴谋未能得逞。上月十二日蒋匪逃离该市时，大部工人被胁迫着离开工厂去修挖工事，一部工人因星期日不在厂内，留在厂里的工人只有四、五十人。当他们听到蒋匪溃逃的消息后，立即组织起纠察队，把全厂各大门全部锁上，并在各要道口上站岗巡视，防止蒋匪破坏，终于胜利地保护了自己的工厂，移交给民主政府。该市军管会成立后，全体工人在军管会领导下，积极坚持工作，始终未停止生产。解放前，全厂工人四千多人已有一月余未领到工资，军管会特拨给五万斤食粮和十亿长城券，初步解决工人生活问题。该厂员工积极支援平津前线的铁路运输，在年前准备装修机车九台，工人并自动提出，挑选两台机车建立“新唐山号”，庆祝自己的解放。这个号召立即受到全厂工人的热烈响应，提出：“装不完不过年”，“装好机车进北平迎接毛主席！”的口号，日以继夜进行装修。该厂建立所的工人克服缺乏机件的困难，把十多年从来未擦洗已经腐坏的锅炉、附件、摇杆、连杆等机件用沙纸加意磨擦，再用油漆涂刷一新。在夜班工作的工人宋久成紧张工作，坚持到第二天中午才抓空去吃饭，表现了高度的劳动热情。在两厂员工积极赶修下，两台“新唐山号”机车及其外七台机车，已在新年前夕全部装好，挂有巨幅毛主席像的“新唐山号”机车，已在唐山解放后的第一个元旦日里，开驶在北宁铁路线上。
    【新华社平津前线三十一日电】北平以东四十里的通县城于十四日为解放军解放后，民主政府人员当即随军入城，布告安民。该城城区发电厂、电灯、电话、自来水等在工人保护下均完好无损。发电厂全部职工一百余人在匪军逃窜时，自动组织“护厂委员会”，并于解放军入城时，向民主政府报告匪军埋藏地雷地点。当晚电灯厂就开始送电。十五日晨自来水亦开始送水。电话局部分工人被蒋匪强迫带走，留下的十五人担负了全城的电话工作。
