To the Editor:
    What is the origin of the Western calendar year 1948? When did the reckoning of the Western calendar begin? Why do we say Western calendar 1948 or 1949? (Just as the Republic of China year 37 or 38 is reckoned from the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty.) I hope you can provide an answer.

    Answer: The Western calendar year 1949 is reckoned from the time of the Christian Era (or Common Era). According to religious说法, the Christian Era is the year Jesus was born. From the Christian Era to the present, 1948 years have passed. Furthermore, because Western European countries uniformly use it, and it is very convenient for calculating years and history, the Western calendar has become the world standard for calculating years.

专栏：询问与答复

　　西历是怎样来的？编辑同志：
    西历一九四八年的来历是从什么时候说起的？为什么要说西历一九四八年或一九四九年？（如中华民国三十七年或三十八年是从推翻满清以后说起的。）请你们给解答一下为盼。

    答：西历一九四九年的来历是从纪元（或公元）时算起的，纪元，按宗教的说法就是耶稣降生的那年。从纪元起到现在已经过了一千九百四十八个年头了。又因为西欧各国都统一的用它，并且计算年代和历史都很方便，因此，西历就成了世界上计算年代的标准。
