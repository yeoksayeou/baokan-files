　　Electric Company Correspondence Group Strives to Write
  　Guaranteeing Thirty-Five Articles This Month
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Electric Company Correspondence Group, responding to the call of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department to strengthen communication work, held a meeting of all correspondents at 1:00 PM on the 6th to discuss how to strengthen communication work. Fifteen correspondents attended. First, the comrade in charge of the Correspondence Group read the notices from the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department and the People's Daily, and then reviewed the reporting work of this stage. During this production competition, the company and various factories had many experiences, lessons, and model achievements that should have been reported in a timely manner, but were not. This has had some impact on our work. The General Branch Committee also reviewed that it had not paid enough attention to communication work in the past, and should pay attention to this work in the future to ensure that our reporting is sound. Finally, everyone raised two suggestions to the newspaper: (1) The newspaper should provide correspondents with some publications to improve everyone's writing skills. (2) Unsuccessful submissions should be returned with notes indicating where revisions are needed. Everyone also made a guarantee: to write thirty-five articles in January, and is determined to work hard to maintain the glorious title of "Model Correspondence Group".

　　电灯公司通讯组努力写作
  　保证本月写稿三十五篇
    【石家庄讯】电灯公司通讯组响应市委宣传部加强通讯工作号召，特于六日下午一时召开全体通讯员会议，讨论如何加强通讯工作，到通讯员十五人。首由通讯组负责同志向大家宣读市委宣传部通知及人民日报社的通知后，即检讨了这一阶段的报导工作，在这次生产竞赛中，公司与各厂有很多应该报导的经验教训，模范成绩，均未及时报导。使我们的工作受到一些影响，总支委也检讨了他过去对通讯工作没有重视起来，今后应注意这件工作，务使我们的报导健全起来。最后大家向报社提出了两项意见：（一）报社应给予通讯员一些修养刊物，提高大家写作能力。（二）寄去的稿不登应退回，并应注明修改的地方。大家并提出了保证：一月份写稿三十五篇，并决心为保持“模范通讯小组”的光荣称号而努力。
