Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 19th: The powerful winter offensive launched by the Greek Democratic Army throughout Greece continues to unfold victoriously in northern Greece. According to a statement issued by the Supreme Command of the Greek Democratic Army, powerful units of the Democratic Army launched an offensive against the city of Naoussa on January 11th and, after two days and three nights of fighting, captured the city.

　　Naoussa is located seventy kilometers west of Thessaloniki in northern Greece and is an important industrial center in western Macedonia. In the battle for Naoussa, the Royalist Fascist army suffered heavy losses. The majority of the Royalist Fascist army's 33rd Brigade was annihilated, and the Democratic Army captured a large amount of spoils. Military observers in Athens pointed out that the capture of Naoussa was the largest offensive operation by the Democratic Army since the beginning of the civil war.

　　While capturing Naoussa, Democratic Army units operating northwest of Thessaloniki launched a diversionary attack, attacking the city of Edessa, inflicting significant losses on the enemy.

　　The Supreme Command of the Greek Democratic Army issued an order to the officers and soldiers of the Third Division, located on the Peloponnese Peninsula in southern Greece, congratulating them on their achievements in 25 days of fighting and calling on them to inflict even heavier blows on the enemy to eliminate the Royalist Fascist army on the Peloponnese Peninsula. The order stated that the Royalist Fascists had not achieved any success in their offensive against the Democratic Army units in the Peloponnese, only managing to capture 10,000 civilians and establish new concentration camps. The Third Division stood firm in its positions and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.

  　攻占工业中主脑萨城
    保皇军第三十三旅大部被歼
    【新华社陕北十九日电】希腊民主军在希腊全境发动的强大的冬季攻势，继续在希腊北部胜利展开。据希腊民主军最高统帅部发表的声明称：民主军强大部队，于一月十一日开始对脑萨城发动攻势，经两日三夜战斗的结果，攻占该城。
    脑萨城位于希腊北部萨罗尼加以西七十公里，是西马其顿的重要工业中心。在脑萨城的争夺战中，保皇法西斯军损失惨重。保皇法西斯军第三十三旅的人员大部被歼，民主军缴获战利品甚多。雅典军事观察家指出：脑萨城的占领，是内战开始以来民主军最大的攻势作战。
    在攻占脑萨城的同时，活动于萨罗尼加西北的民主军部队，曾发动牵制性攻击，进攻爱地萨城，予敌以重大损失。
    希腊民主军最高统帅部向活动于位于希腊南部摩里亚半岛的第三师官兵发布命令，庆贺第三师官兵在二十五天战斗中所获的成就，并号召他们予敌人更加沉重的打击，以消灭摩里亚半岛上的保皇法西斯军。该命令称：保皇法西斯在进攻摩里亚民主军部队的过程中，毫无任何成功，仅能捕去平民万人和建立新的集中营。第三师部队屹然不动地守住阵地，并予敌以重大损失。
