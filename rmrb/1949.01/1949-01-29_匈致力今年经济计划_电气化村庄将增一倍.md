Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: The Electrical Communications Agency and TASS report: Hungary is currently striving to implement the final year of its three-year economic plan.

　　In terms of electrification, 250 farms have already been electrified in the first two years of the three-year plan, benefiting 150,000 people. In 1949, another 250 villages will be electrified, adding 150,000 new electricity users. In 1949, efforts will be made to modernize electrical equipment in order to save 400,000 tons of coal annually. At the end of 1948, Hungary's electricity production had already exceeded the pre-war average by 38%, and by the end of 1949, it is expected to exceed it by 50%.

　　In terms of agricultural mechanization, several hundred of Hungary's best steelworkers will be trained in instructor training classes at the national agricultural machinery and tractor stations in the country's major steel factories for the next four months. At the same time, several thousand young male and female farmers are learning to use various agricultural machines. The total number of agricultural machines will be double that of the original in 1949. In this way, Hungary is applying the principle of the politically most conscious elements of the working class leading the peasants to practical work, while at the same time consolidating the alliance between urban workers and working peasants.

　　In terms of agriculture and animal husbandry, Hungary's potato harvest has exceeded the pre-war level by 28%. There are currently two million cattle and sheep, which is 200,000 more than the level set for 1950 in the three-year plan. The total number of horses has also exceeded the 1950 plan. According to Raz, Secretary-General of the National Alliance of Working Peasants and Agricultural Workers, Hungary's investment in agriculture in 1948 was 800 million Hungarian Forints, and this appropriation will reach 1 billion Hungarian Forints in 1949.

　　匈致力今年经济计划
  　电气化村庄将增一倍
    【新华社陕北十九日电】电通社与塔斯社报导：匈牙利现正努力实施三年经济计划的最后一年计划。
    在电气化方面，三年计划头两年有二百五十个农庄业已电气化，用电者达十五万人。一九四九年，另有二百五十个村庄将实行电气化，这样将增加十五万新的用电者。一九四九年，电气设备将力求现代化，以便每年节省四十万吨煤。一九四八年末，匈牙利电力生产已较战前平均数超过百分之三十八，而到一九四九年末时，预计将超过百分之五十。
    在农业机械化方面，匈牙利好几百最优秀的钢铁工人，今后四个月将在全国各主要的钢铁工厂开办的国家农业机器和拖拉机站指导员训练班受训，同时，有几千男女青年农民在学习使用各种农业机器。农业机器的总数，在一九四九年将比原有的增加一倍。这样，匈牙利正把工人阶级政治上最觉悟的分子领导农民的原则，应用到实际工作中去，而同时巩固着城市工人与劳动农民的联盟。
    在农牧业方面，匈牙利马铃薯收获量已超过战前水平百分之二十八。现有牛羊二百万头，较三年计划规定的一九五零年的水平多了二十万头。马的总数也已超出一九五零年计划。据全国劳动农民与农业工人联盟总书记拉兹宣称：一九四八年匈牙利经营农业的投资有八亿匈币，而一九四九年的此项拨款将达十亿匈币。
