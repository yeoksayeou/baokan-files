Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 5th: A certain unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army, in the battle to annihilate the Huang Wei Corps, extensively carried out military democracy. From pre-battle earthwork to post-battle review, the wisdom of the masses was fully utilized, thereby victoriously completing the combat mission. After the PLA's attack on Liweizi on the 12th of last month proved ineffective, all participating units held meetings to review the situation. Cadres and observers from the artillery units of the East China Field Army, which cooperated in the operation, along with assault team leaders from the attacking units, personally went to the areas closest to the target to meticulously study the bombardment targets indicated by the infantry, as well as the selected assault routes and breakthrough points. Before the second attack on the 16th, cadres from the assault companies, platoons, and squads personally observed the terrain and conducted studies. A certain general in charge personally led the entire unit in sand table training. Soldiers in the assault squads used the time while the cadres were observing the terrain to practice how to attack hidden bunkers. They practiced and studied simultaneously, and finally conducted a comprehensive study once more. After the assault squad leader returned from observing the terrain, he immediately gathered the soldiers to study the attack methods. After the troops entered the position, all the soldiers in the squad observed the terrain again and specifically determined how each group would move and cooperate. Because of the meticulous study and planning made in advance, when the attack was launched, the assault squad broke through the enemy's front line in just five minutes and completely annihilated two enemy regiments. Zhang Yingcai's battalion of a certain unit, before the battle of Xiaozhangzhuang on the 2nd, the battalion leadership foresaw nine possible situations that might occur during the battle and raised nine "What to do?" questions, which were hotly discussed among the cadres and soldiers as a form of tactical Q&A. Based on the results of the discussion, the 3rd Company of the battalion conducted repeated drills every night, looking for shortcomings in the specific actions. The soldiers of the company also personally inspected the terrain and came up with ways to overcome difficulties. In the battle, the battalion defeated the attack of two enemy regiments supported by enemy aircraft and tanks with fewer forces and annihilated one enemy battalion, thereby winning an award from higher authorities. Wang Guoying's platoon of the 10th Company of a certain regiment also repeatedly won victories because of the development of military democracy and attention to tactics.

　　中原解放军某部
  　周密研究作战技术
    【新华社淮海前线五日电】中原人民解放军某部，在歼灭黄维兵团的战斗中，普遍开展军事民主。做到了从战前的土工作业直至战后检讨，都充分发挥了群众的智慧，因而胜利地完成战斗任务。上月十二日解放军进攻李围子未能奏效后，参战各部均开会检讨。协同作战的华东野战军炮兵部队的营连干部及观察员，亦会同攻击部队之突击队长，亲赴最接近目标之处，周密研讨步兵指示的轰击目标及其选择的冲锋道路与突破口。十六日，该部二次攻击前，突击连、排、班的干部亲自观察地形，做了研究，负责指挥的某将军亲自领导整个部队作了沙盘教育。突击班的战士利用干部看地形的空闲时间，演习怎样打暗碉，他们一面演习，一面研究，最后又综合研究一次。突击班长看地形回来后，即召集战士研究如何打法。部队进入阵地后，全班战士又看了一次地形，并具体确定各个组如何动作、如何配合。由于预先作了周密的研究与布置，当发起攻击时，突击班仅五分钟即突破敌前沿，全歼守敌两个团。某部张英才营，于二日小张庄战斗前，该营领导机关预见到战斗中可能发生的九种情况，提出九个“怎么办？”在干部与战士中热烈讨论，作为突击问答。该营第三连依照讨论的结果，每天夜晚进行反复演习，从具体动作中找缺点，该连战士并亲自察看地形，想出克服困难的办法。在战斗中，该营以少胜多，击退敌飞机坦克配合下两个团的进攻，并歼灭敌人一个营，因而荣获上级的奖励。某团第十连王国英排，亦因开展军事民主讲求战术，屡获胜利。
