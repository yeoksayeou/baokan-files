The annihilated bandit army's three army corps were Qiu Qingquan's Second Army Corps, Li Mi's Thirteenth Army Corps, and Sun Yuanliang's Sixteenth Army Corps, among which Sun's army corps was annihilated on the 7th of last month when it broke out of Xuzhou during its escape. Among the enemy's three army corps, Qiu Qingquan's and Li Mi's two army corps were the Kuomintang's direct line troops. Qiu's Fifth Army was one of the most elite troops of the Kuomintang. Together with the Reorganized 74th Division annihilated in Menglianggu, Mengyin in May 1947, the 18th Army annihilated southwest of Suxian in December of last year (formerly the Reorganized 11th Division), and the New First Army and New Sixth Army annihilated in western Liaoning in October of last year, they were collectively known as the "Five Main Forces" of the Kuomintang's direct line troops. This army was Jiang's earliest mechanized army corps. Its predecessor was the Army Armored Corps. In 1939, based on this corps, it was expanded into the Fifth Army, with Du Yuming as the commander. After this army was annihilated this time, the so-called "Five Main Forces" of the Kuomintang bandit army have all been annihilated.
