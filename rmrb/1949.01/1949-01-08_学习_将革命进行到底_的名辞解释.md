　　Explanations of Terms for Studying "Carry the Revolution Through to the End"
　　Territorial Rights – That is, a country has its own territory, and within its territorial domain, the country has the right to handle the sovereignty of its own people and the actions of foreigners residing within. If a country's territory is unreasonably occupied or interfered with by foreigners, or the territory is occupied, it is selling out or damaging territorial rights. China's territorial rights, however, have been sold out to the United States by Chiang Kai-shek, giving the U.S. imperialists army bases in places like Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Moreover, in the "Chiang-U.S. Commercial Treaty," this was expanded to allow Americans to enter Chinese territory and grant them the freedom to reside, travel, and do business throughout China.
　　Special Privileges in Internal Affairs and Diplomacy – An independent country has the right to independently decide its internal and diplomatic policies, and foreign imperialists have no right to interfere. However, Chiang Kai-shek, this running dog of U.S. imperialism, also sold the final decision-making power over China's internal affairs and diplomacy to his U.S. imperialist masters. In the past, in the Military Tripartite Executive Headquarters, Chiang Kai-shek's representative, Xu Yongchang, proposed giving Marshall the final decision-making power. Chiang Kai-shek's various domestic policies were also decided according to the will of U.S. imperialism. To facilitate the collusion between Chiang and the U.S. and avoid direct interference in order to deceive the people, American advisors were set up in various political institutions. For example, the American Bailey served as Chiang Kai-shek's advisor to the Ministry of Transportation, Pound served as Chiang Kai-shek's advisor to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the American Dade served as Chiang Kai-shek's advisor to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Also, the "Chiang-U.S. Relief Agreement" signed by Chiang and the U.S. in October 1946 completely sold China's internal and external administrative powers to U.S. imperialism. Last August, the "Sino-U.S. Joint Committee for the Management of Construction and Equipment Replacement Funds" established U.S. imperialism's privileges to supervise and monopolize industry, mining, and transportation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Furthermore, the "Sino-U.S. Cooperation Organization," a special agent organization jointly run by Chiang and the U.S., placed Chiang Kai-shek's police and secret agents under the control of U.S. imperialism. Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan even reported information on its internal development and diplomatic relations to Wedemeyer and awaited instructions. The U.S. Embassy in China became the center of U.S. imperialism's supervisory activities over the Chiang bandit regime. For example, the staging of the pseudo-"National Assembly" in 1946 and Chiang's suppression and destruction of the patriotic democratic movement were all carried out under the instructions of U.S. imperialism.
　　Inland Navigation Rights – That is, a country's sovereignty over navigation on all rivers within its territory. This sovereignty has been sold by Chiang Kai-shek to the United States in exchange for U.S. imperialism's smoother military and economic assistance. This was passed on June 5, 1946, by the Kuomintang's Supreme National Defense Council, headed by Chiang Kai-shek – that is, allowing foreign ships to freely sail and load and unload goods in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places. In the opening method, foreign ships were allowed to transport "U.S. aid" materials that were directly transported to China from abroad to Nanjing, Hankou, and other places, and foreign ships were allowed to directly transport Chinese materials from Nanjing, Hankou, and other places to foreign countries. The so-called foreign ships were limited to ships flying the U.S. flag. The "Chiang-U.S. Commercial Treaty" of November 4, 1946, made the right of U.S. ships to freely navigate China's inland rivers even more openly "legalized." Furthermore, in order to cooperate with the implementation of the "Chiang-U.S. Commercial Treaty," U.S. imperialism sent more than 30 large ships to frequently sail to major commercial ports in North China, Central China, South China, and Southeast Asia. In this way, U.S. imperialism monopolized China's import and export shipping and destroyed China's privately-run shipping industry.
　　Territorial Sea Rights – That is, a country's sovereignty within its territorial sea. China's sovereignty over its territorial sea was completely sold to the United States by Chiang Kai-shek in 1946; allowing U.S. imperialist navies to freely come and go and patrol in China's South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea, and to freely station troops in Chinese seaports such as Shanghai, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao (now liberated by us), allowing 40 U.S. warships to be permanently stationed in Qingdao, and selling Taiwan and Hainan Island to U.S. imperialism as naval bases. In the "Thirty-Year Dockyard Agreement" passed by Chiang Kai-shek on June 5, 1946, the right to coastal and inland navigation in China was opened to U.S. imperialism for thirty years, and an agreement was established with MacArthur to allow 40 Japanese sea vessels to fish in the Chinese coastal waters for one year. Subsequently, the 37th Japanese gunboat escorted six Japanese ships into the Shanghai coast. At the end of 1947 and last January, there were as many as 14 Japanese fishing boats entering the Zhejiang sea area to fish, allowing Japanese forces to re-enter our country through U.S. imperialism. The "Naval Agreement" established by Chiang and the U.S. in December 1947 stipulated that Chiang and the U.S. would jointly defend the Pacific coast, allowing the U.S. Navy to completely control the Chinese coast and allowing U.S. warships to freely enter Chinese ports.

　　学习“将革命进行到底”的名辞解释
    领土权——即一个国家有一个国家的国土，在自己的国土领域内，国家有权处理本国人民及外人居住行动的主权。如果一国的领土任外人无理侵占或外人无理干涉，或侵占国土，就是出卖或损害了领土权。中国的领土权，却被蒋介石出卖给美国，给美帝以陆军基地如南京、上海、天津、青岛等地，而在“蒋美商约”中，更扩大而为允许美国人进入中国领土，并给他们在全中国内有居住、旅行、做生意的自由。
    内政外交特权——一个独立的国家都有自己独立的决定内政外交政策的权利，外国帝国主义是无权干涉的。可是，蒋介石这个美帝国主义的走狗，就把中国内政外交的最后决定权，也出卖给它的美帝国主义了。在过去的军事三人小组，蒋介石的代表徐永昌就提议给马歇尔的最后决定权，蒋介石的对内各种政策，也依照美帝国的意旨来决定。为便于蒋美狼狈为奸，而又避免直接干涉的方式，以欺骗人民，又便在各种政治机构内设有美国顾问，如美人白利担任了蒋介石的交通部顾问，庞德任蒋介石的司法行政部顾问，美国戴德为蒋介石的经济部花纱布管理委员会的顾问，又如一九四六年十月蒋美签订的“蒋美救济协定”，把中国对内对外的行政权完全卖给美帝国主义，去年八月，蒋美合组的“处理建设及配备替换基金之中美联合委员会”，确立了美帝国主义对国民党统治区工、矿、交通的监督、垄断特权，又如蒋美合办的特务机关“中美合作所”，蒋介石的警察和特务都为美帝国主义所管辖。蒋介石的行政院更把其内政发展及外交关系的情报向魏德迈作报告并听候训令，美帝国驻华大使馆成为美帝国对蒋匪政权的监督活动中心，如一九四六年的伪“国大”的扮演，蒋匪对爱国民主运动的镇压摧残，都是在美帝国指示下进行的。
    内河航行权——即一个国家在自己国土内所有江河航行的主权，这个主权已被蒋介石卖给美国，以换取美帝国主义在军事上经济上更顺利地援助。这是在一九四六年六月五日，以蒋介石为首的国民党最高国防委员会通过的——即允许外国轮船在南京、芜湖、九江、汉口等地自由行驶和装卸货物，在开航的办法中，允许外国船只装运自国外上岸直接运华的“美援”物资，到南京、汉口等地，并准外国船只从南京、汉口等地把中国物资直接运出国外，而所说的外国船只是只限于挂有美国国旗的船只。一九四六年十一月四日的“蒋美商约”中使美帝船只自由航行中国内河的权利，更为公开“合法”化了，并且美帝国主义为配合“蒋美商约”的实施，又派了三十多只大船经常航行华北、华中、华南及南洋的各大商埠。这样，使美帝国主义垄断了我国进出口航运，并摧毁了我国民营的航行事业。
    领海权——即一个国家在自己领海内的主权。中国领海的主权，已于一九四六年完全被蒋介石出卖给美国了；让美帝国主义的海军自由往来巡逻在中国的南海、东海、黄海、渤海，自由驻防在中国的海港如上海、青岛、秦皇岛（已为我解放）等地，允许美舰四十艘常驻在青岛，又把台湾、海南岛卖给美帝国主义作为海军基地。蒋介石在一九四六年六月五日通过的“三十年船坞协定”中，把中国沿海内河航权向美帝国主义开放三十年，并与麦克阿瑟成立协定，让日本海船四十艘在中国沿海捕鱼一年，接着就有第三十七号日本炮舰一艘护送六只日船开入上海海岸，在一九四七年底及去年一月，日本渔船进入浙江海面打渔的有十四只之多，使日本势力经过美帝国主义重新侵入我国。一九四七年十二月蒋美成立的“海军协定”中，规定了蒋美共同保卫太平洋海岸让美国海军全部控制了中国海岸，又让美国军舰自由进入中国的口岸。
