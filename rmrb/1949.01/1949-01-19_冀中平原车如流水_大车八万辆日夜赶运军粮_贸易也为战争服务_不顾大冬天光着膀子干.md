[Jizhong Electric Dispatch] Since the start of the campaign to liberate Tianjin and Beijing, the broad masses of the people in Jizhong have bravely supported the front lines, and the first phase of the grain transportation task has been successfully completed. As of the 6th of this month, the entire region has mobilized 74,615 large carts for grain transportation and 10,100 large carts accompanying the army, totaling 84,715 carts. The manpower used for grain transportation, rice husking, and flour milling alone totaled 457,420, and the animal power totaled 457,190. In addition, there were 161 companies of stretchers accompanying the army and for transportation, 92 companies of militia, 2,500 ice sleds, etc., which were not included in the calculation. Nine hundred handcarts from the Tenth Sub-district steadily arrived at the front lines, carrying out the great transportation tasks assigned to them by the front lines. In order to ensure the supply of grain to the front-line troops and civilian laborers, the people of the entire region, under the leadership of the county and district, universally launched a support-the-front movement of rice husking and flour milling. Animal power, electric power, and mills of all sizes throughout the region operated day and night. Within 20 days, they completed husking 47,630,000 catties of rice and milling 5,743,000 catties of flour, exceeding the task by more than 30%. On the hundreds of miles of roads leading to Tianjin and Beijing, more than 80,000 carts formed a long line, truly "vehicles flowing like water," transporting military grain day and night. In order to timely supply and invigorate the economic activity of the war zone, various economic departments have paid attention to the close integration of material supply work and the entire war zone economic work. The state-owned Longchang and the Eighth Sub-district stores accompanying the army to support the front, on the one hand, were helped by the government's allocation of grain, and on the other hand, they transported large quantities of materials from the rear to sell at a fair price in the Gu'an market, stabilizing and lowering fluctuating prices. This supported the local currency, invigorated the local economy, and ensured military and civilian needs. Supply stations for firewood and grass were set up on the Tianjin West front lines, and many food and lodging stations were set up on the Pingda Road north of the Daqing River, and in Gu'an, Renqiu, and other counties to solve the difficulties of food and lodging for civilian laborers along the way. Before the start of the campaign, in order to welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, people of all ages, men and women, throughout the region launched a campaign to repair bridges and roads. According to statistics from the Eighth Sub-district: 42 li of the Jinpu Road were repaired, 1,208 li of highways were repaired, 28 large and small bridges were newly built and repaired, and most of the highways and bridges in other areas have been repaired. All the roads are flat and wide leading to Tianjin and Beijing, which greatly guarantees the timeliness and convenience of transportation. The more than 50 members of the Tenth Sub-district Telegraph Team completed the task of erecting 260 li of telegraph lines in five days, ensuring smooth communication between the front and the rear. When the mobilization order reached the villages, the people excitedly expressed their heroic fighting spirit and threw themselves into the battle to "attack Tianjin and Beijing and capture Fu Zuoyi alive." In most villages, militia, civilian laborers, and stretcher teams gathered in the district within four or five hours. Li Jilin and Wang Luocheng, model civilian laborers from Anguo, immediately found the county armed forces department after hearing the news of the attack on Tianjin and Beijing. Wang Luocheng said: "Last time when we attacked Taiyuan, I happened to have an eye infection and couldn't go; this time I plan to join the cart team with both my person and my cart!" They repeatedly requested to go on the expedition. Wang Xiaode, Hu Chengqun, and others from the Xiong County stretcher team, who had been left at home, heard that they were going to fight in Tianjin and Beijing and went on an expedition to carry stretchers, leaving their work at home and catching up with the stretcher team. They walked 100 li in one day and caught up with the stretcher team. In Jianglinhe Village, Zhengzhou, the district needed nine militiamen, and eleven went voluntarily. When repairing the Ju Fu Bridge, Dong Wenfu, the pile driver from Lou Di in Renqiu, led the whole team to work shirtless, completing the task ahead of schedule. Wang Zhongzhi, an old man over sixty years old from Fengjiapu, Huanghua County, got up early and went to transport wood in the mud. The masses in the newly liberated Fourth and Fifth districts of Jinan New District, upon receiving the news of the attack on Tianjin, got up before dawn and actively repaired roads. When Cang County was repairing the Jinpu Road, villages launched competitions with each other. Wang Guantun and Yangjiaqiao completed five days of work in one day. When Boye was building the highway, Li Luohe and Wang Luohe, who were over sixty years old from Beibaisha, were not asked to go by the village, but they automatically carried their shovels and started working.
