　　Request to Establish Contact with Party Committees and Trade Unions in Newly Liberated Cities

    Comrades of Party Committees and Trade Unions in Newly Liberated Cities:
    In order to strengthen reporting on newly recovered cities, we hope that you can designate specific individuals to establish direct contact with us. And help us establish reading and communication relationships in various factories, organizations, schools, and mass organizations. We look forward to receiving your reply soon.
