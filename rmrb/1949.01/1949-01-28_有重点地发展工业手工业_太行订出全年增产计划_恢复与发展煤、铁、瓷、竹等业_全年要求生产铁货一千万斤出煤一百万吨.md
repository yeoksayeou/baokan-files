[Taihang Electric] The Taihang Administrative Office has recently preliminarily drafted the 1949 Taihang industrial and handicraft production plan, summarized as follows:

I. Historical Situation and Current Status of Taihang Industry and Handicraft Industry

The industry and handicraft industry in the Taihang area were relatively developed before the War of Resistance Against Japan: iron products were sold throughout the country; other industries such as coal, porcelain, bamboo, fur, papermaking, and straw braid were also sold in North China. During the War of Resistance, most of the industrial areas were occupied by the enemy, and the industry and handicraft industry were severely destroyed, especially iron and porcelain. The output was only 8.5% to 30% of that before the war. The industry and handicraft industry in our base areas have been somewhat developed, especially the military industry and papermaking, textile industry, etc. After the Japanese surrendered, most of the enemy-occupied industrial areas were liberated, and production was generally restored. However, due to our unclear policies and ideas, many industries and handicraft industries were violated during the land reform. Therefore, in recent years, a large number could have been restored and developed, but a large number stagnated; some even declined. The general manifestations were lack of capital, reduced technology, insufficient raw material capital, low output, low quality, and high cost. Egalitarianism in wages and poor teacher-student labor relations are also quite serious. After the industry and commerce conference in May 1948, after correcting deviations and making compensation, the mood of industrial and handicraft operators stabilized, and production gradually recovered and developed. In addition, farmers demanded to develop production after the land reform, which provided more favorable conditions.

II. Guiding Principles

Based on the above situation, the guiding principles for industrial production are: A. Focus on restoring and developing industrial and handicraft industries engaged in the production of production tools and supplies, and improving quality while increasing production. B. Support the development of handicraft and industrial industries related to military industry and military supplies, and continue to improve quality and reduce costs. C. Encourage the restoration and development of essential industrial and handicraft production and some industrial and handicraft production that are beneficial to people's livelihood and still have a market.

III. Specific Plan

First, the iron industry center is in Yincheng Town (under Changzhi), which is the distribution center for iron goods in Changzhi, Huguan, Lingchuan and Gaoping, Jincheng, Qinshui, and Yangcheng counties in Taiyue. The most prosperous period was before and after 1924. In Changzhi and Huguan alone, there were 1,879 various iron furnaces and 13,039 workers, with annual sales of 15 million jin of raw and cooked iron goods. Later, due to warlord melee and traffic congestion, it declined year by year. After the Japanese invaders occupied the area, it became even more depressed. At that time, there were only 163 furnaces, accounting for 8.5% of the most prosperous period. After liberation, in the spring of 1946, the number of furnaces in Changzhi and Huguan counties once recovered to 775, reaching 40% of the peak period. After 1947, due to biases in the implementation of industrial and commercial policies, production was greatly affected, all the stir-frying furnaces were shut down, and most of the square furnaces were closed. In Huguan, there were 63 large square furnaces in 1946, which were later reduced to 27. Recently, the mass production mood has stabilized, and the sales of iron industry have gradually expanded, showing a situation of supply falling short of demand. Therefore, the product quality is low and raw materials are lacking. The guiding principle is to vigorously restore, first of all to restore raw material furnaces, requiring the restoration of various furnaces to 944 in 1946 this year, producing 10 million jin of finished products.

Second, coal industry: Coal is produced in 22 counties in the entire region. It is required that the entire region produce 1 million tons of coal this year (excluding those operated by the Enterprise Department), of which Taihang Industrial Company will complete 300,000 tons, and cooperatives, private enterprises, and institutions will jointly complete 700,000 tons.

Third, porcelain industry: Pengcheng, Cixian County is the center of the porcelain industry (in addition, some counties have small-scale porcelain industry not included), and sales are very wide. It once recovered after liberation, but later tended to be depressed due to various conditions. Now it needs to be restored in large quantities, and the focus should be on the needs of rural families. Such as bowls, basins, vats, jars, pots, etc. This year, various kilns are required to reach 177 (currently 160), with an annual output of 80 million pieces (currently an annual output of 71.2844 million pieces). Fourth, bamboo industry: Bolang Town, Boai County, northern Henan is the distribution center for bamboo goods. Before the War of Resistance, the bamboo industry in the surrounding 30+ villages was very developed. There were more than 6,700 workers engaged in the bamboo industry, and there were 11,185 mu of bamboo gardens (mature gardens - that is, good gardens 6,662 mu, semi-mature gardens 2,878 mu, barren gardens 2,145 mu), with an annual output of more than 17.2111 million jin of bamboo, and dozens of kinds of finished products were made, with an annual transaction of more than 2 million yuan (silver dollars). The Japanese invaders destroyed a lot when they invaded. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits seized the land from the people in October 1946 and carried out large-scale felling in July 1947, causing the bamboo industry to decline. Currently, there are 208 mu of semi-mature gardens and 8,983 mu of barren gardens, totaling 9,196 mu, accounting for 82% of that before the war; the annual output of bamboo is more than 2.3333 million jin, accounting for 13% of that before the War of Resistance; there are 7,304 workers, but there are few skilled workers; the raw materials are still short of more than 250,000 jin per month, and most of them rely on western Henan. This year's focus is on effectively cultivating bamboo gardens to solve the difficulty of raw materials, requiring 4 million jin of finished goods.

Fifth, paper industry: In addition to the five state-owned paper mills in the entire region, Lingchuan's mulberry bark paper and Linxian and Tangyin's paper mulberry bark paper are also household side businesses. Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, Zuoquan, Pingshun, and Heshun, as well as Licheng Shibizhi, Lucheng Zaozhen, Xingtai Duge Lao, and Wu'an Pianshan, all produce hemp paper, and most of them are operated by workshops. Qinyang produces miankong paper. The entire region needs 95,000 pieces of paper throughout the year. Therefore, it is required that the paper production in 1949 reach 100,000 pieces (one piece is 1,000 sheets): state-owned factories produce 38,000 pieces (now the five factories with 81 ponds produce 23,400 pieces per year). Cooperatives and private enterprises (excluding Qinyang wheat straw paper) jointly produce 73,000 pieces (now cooperatives have 987 paper ponds, with an annual output of 60,900 pieces; private enterprises have 9 ponds, with an annual output of 2,700 pieces).

Sixth, saltpeter industry: At present, there are two cities and twenty-eight counties in the Taihang saltpeter producing area, with a total of 1,220 saltpeter workshops, 1,354 saltpeter pots, and 5,122 workers. The guiding principle is: to vigorously develop the plains, while maintaining the status quo in the mountains, or even reducing them (because the raw materials in the plains are superior to those in the mountains). From last October to September this year, the saltpeter production plan for 31 counties and cities is to produce a total of 3.249 million jin of saltpeter.

Seventh, straw hat industry: Most areas of Lucheng, villages along the Zhanghe River in Licheng, and a small number of villages in Pingshun had 11,300 women weaving braids and 110 straw hat machines before the war. It was a household side business, and it was sold in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Gansu, Ningxia and other provinces, with an annual income of more than 640,000 silver dollars. It almost completely collapsed during the War of Resistance. It has gradually recovered after liberation. There are currently more than 6,600 women weaving braids, weaving a total of 73,087 jin of straw hat braids, and 60 straw hat machines (Xiangyuan has 15 straw hat machines, and the braids are supplied by Lucheng). In half a year, a total of more than 189,800 straw hats were produced. This year, straw hat machines are required to produce year-round, producing 360,000 straw hats, and women weaving braids can weave braids year-round to ensure that there is no shortage of straw hat braids.

Eighth, stationery industry: mainly in Qinyang County, northern Henan. Before the war, the county produced about 2.5 million brushes every year, and the output of black ink, slate, and stone pencils was also very large. There were more than 1,000 workers producing stone pencils alone. Xingtai, Hebei also produces brushes and ink. At present, due to the lack of raw materials, the output has been reduced. For example, Qinyang produces only 610,000 brushes and 25,000 ingots of ink annually. This year's goal is to strive to restore the pre-war level.

To complete the above plan, the following common problems must be solved: First, solve the difficulty of raw materials, and vigorously support and reward the production and supply of raw materials. For example, the Xingtai Iron Factory needs raw materials supplied from Changzhi area; in addition to cultivating bamboo gardens, the bamboo industry should plan to absorb mature bamboo from south of the Yellow River and western Henan to the north; the paper industry should cultivate raw materials such as paper mulberry, mulberry, and hemp bark. Second, there is a shortage of skilled workers, which should be solved by rewarding apprenticeships and correctly resolving wage issues. Third, there is insufficient funds and inflexible transportation, which should be solved in two ways: A. Organize cooperatives to widely absorb labor and capital to buy shares. B. Reward private investment and joint ventures, and the government should focus on support.

　　有重点地发展工业手工业
  　太行订出全年增产计划
    恢复与发展煤、铁、瓷、竹等业
  　全年要求生产铁货一千万斤出煤一百万吨
    【太行电】太行行政公署于最近初步拟出一九四九年太行工业手工业生产计划，摘要如下：
    一、太行工业手工业的历史情况与现状
    太行区工业手工业，抗战前较为发达：铁业产品销售几遍全国；其他煤、磁、竹、皮毛、造纸、草帽辫等业，也行销华北各地。抗战中大部工业区为敌占领，工业手工业皆遭严重摧毁，铁、磁、尤甚，产量仅达战前百分之八点五至百分之三十；在我根据地地区的工业与手工业，则得到一些发展，特别是军火工业与造纸、纺织业等。日寇投降后，敌占工业区大部解放，生产普遍得到恢复，但由于我们政策思想不明确，故在土改中侵犯了不少工业与手工业，因而几年来本可大量恢复与发展的，反大量停滞不前；有的甚至是衰退了，普遍的表现资本缺乏，技术降低，原料资本不足，产量少，质量低，成本高。工资中的平均主义，师徒劳资关系的不好，也颇严重。一九四八年五月工商业会议后，经过纠偏退补，工业手工业经营者情绪安定，逐渐恢复与发展生产，加之农民在土改后要求发展生产，就更有了有利的条件。
    二、方针
    根据以上情况，工业生产的方针是：甲、有重点地恢复与发展从事生产工具及用品的工业手工业，在增产中提高质量。乙、凡对军火、军需工业有关的手工业与工业，要扶植其发展，继续提高质量，减低成本。丙、凡必需品工业及一些有利于民生而仍有市场的工业手工业生产，应奖励其恢复与发展。
    三、具体计划
    第一，铁业中心在荫城镇（长治属），是长治、壶关、陵川及太岳之高平、晋城、沁水、阳城等县的铁货集散地，民国十三年前后为最盛时期，仅长治、壶关即有各种铁炉一千八百七十九座，工人一万三千零三十九个，年销生熟铁货达一千五百万斤。以后因军阀混战，交通阻塞，逐年下降。日寇侵占该地后，更为萧条，当时只有炉一百六十三座，占最盛时期百分之八点五。解放后，长治、壶关两县在一九四六年春，各种炉曾一度恢复至七百七十五座，达极盛时期百分之四十。一九四七年以后，由于工商业政策执行上有偏向，影响生产不少，炒炉全部停顿，方炉大部歇业。壶关一九四六年有大方炉六十三座，后减至二十七座。最近群众生产情绪安定，铁业销路日渐扩大，已呈供不应求之象。因此产品质低，原料缺乏，方针是大力恢复，首先是恢复原料炉，要求本年度将各种炉恢复到一九四六年的九百四十四座，生产成货一千万斤。
    第二、煤业：全区二十二县产煤，要求本年度全区产煤一百万吨（不包括企业部经营的），其中太行实业公司完成三十万吨，合作社、私营、机关生产共完成七十万吨。
    第三、瓷业：磁县彭城为瓷业中心（此外尚有一些县份有小规模的瓷业未计在内），行销很广，解放后一度恢复，后因种种条件，又趋萧条，现在需要大量恢复，重点应放在农村家庭需要上。如碗、盆、缸、坛、罐等。本年度各种窑要求达到一百七十七座（现一百六十座），年产货八千万件（现年产七千一百二十八万四千件）。第四、竹业：豫北博爱县波良镇是竹货集散地，抗战前周围三十多村竹业很发达，从事竹业的工人有六千七百余人，有竹园一万一千一百八十五亩（成园——即好园六千六百六十二亩，半成园二千八百七十八亩，荒园二千一百四十五亩），年产竹一千七百廿一万一千余斤，制成成品达数十种，每年成交二百余万元（银元），日寇侵入时破坏不少。蒋匪于一九四六年十月从人民手中夺去该地，一九四七年七月间大加砍伐，使竹业下降。目前有半成园二百零八亩，荒园八千九百八十三亩，共九千一百九十六亩，占战前百分之八十二；年产竹二百三十三万三千余斤，占抗战前百分之十三；工人有七千三百零四人，但技术工人少；原料每月尚缺二十五万余斤，多仰给于豫西。今年重点是有效的培养竹园，以解决原料困难，要求出成货四百万斤。
    第五、纸业：全区除五个公营纸厂外，尚有陵川的桑皮纸、林县、汤阴的楮皮纸均为家庭副业。襄垣、武乡、左权、平顺、和顺以及黎城石壁纸，潞城枣臻、邢台杜各老、武安骈山等地，均产麻纸，且多为作坊经营。沁阳产面空纸。全区全年需纸九万五千块，因此要求一九四九年产纸要达到十万块（一块为一千张）：公营厂出产三万八千块（现在五个厂八十一个池年产二万三千四百块）。合作与私营（未包括沁阳麦秸纸）共产七万三千块（现合作经营有纸池九百八十七个，年产纸六万零九百块；私营有池九个，年产纸二千七百块）。
    第六、火硝业：现太行产硝地区共有两个市、二十八个县，共有硝坊一二二零座，硝锅一三五四口，工人五一二二人。方针是：大量发展平原，山地则保持现状，甚至减少（因平原原料较山地优越）。去年十月至本年度九月，火硝生产计划为三十一县、市，共产硝三百二十四万九千斤。
    第七、草帽业：潞城大部地区、黎城沿漳河各村庄及平顺少部村庄，战前有编辫妇女一万一千三百人，草帽机一百一十架，是一种家庭副业，行销晋、陕、豫、甘、宁等省，年收银洋六十四万余元。抗战中几乎全部垮台。解放后逐渐恢复。现有编辫妇女六千六百余人，共编草帽辫七万三千零八十七斤，草帽机六十架（襄垣有草帽机十五架，辫子仰给于潞城），半年共产草帽十八万九千八百余顶。本年度要求草帽机长年生产，出草帽三十六万顶，编辫妇女可长年编辫，保证不缺草帽辫。
    第八、文具业：主要在豫北沁阳县。该县战前每年约产毛笔二百五十万支，黑墨、石板、石笔产量也很大，仅石笔工人即有一千余人。河北邢台也产笔、墨。目前由于原料缺乏，产量缩小，如沁阳年产毛笔只六十一万支，墨两万五千锭。今年的目标是力求恢复战前水平。
    完成上述计划，必须解决以下几个普遍性的问题：一、解决原料的困难，要大力扶助、奖励原料的生产与供给。如邢台铁工厂就需要经长治一带供给原料；竹业除培养竹园外，要有计划的吸收黄河南及豫西地的成竹北来；纸业上应培植楮、桑、麻皮等原料。二、技术工人缺少，要从奖励带徒弟，正确解决工资问题两方面来解决。三、资金不足，运输不灵，这要从两方面解决：甲、组织合作社，广为吸收劳资入股。乙、奖励私人投资与合股经营，政府并要有重点的扶助。
