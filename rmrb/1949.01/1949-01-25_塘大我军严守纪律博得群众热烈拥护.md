　　[Tianjin Electric] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army that liberated Tanggu strictly implemented the policy of protecting newly recovered cities. Their strict discipline won warm support from the masses. After our army cleared out the remaining enemies and entered Tanggu on the night of the 16th, it immediately sent guards to stand guard at the gates of factories, hospitals, warehouses, and schools to protect them. When a certain unit arrived at the nationally renowned Yongli Alkali Plant, it immediately sent guards to stand guard and protect the factory. The soldiers rested outside the factory, and none of them entered the machine shop or workshops. When our army purchased goods, they always paid the full amount first and then took the items. On the 18th, a comrade had already bought a fountain pen at the Yongfa Lou Stationery Store. When he reached into his pocket, he realized he hadn't brought any money. So, he explained to the shopkeeper that he would leave the pen there first and bring the money to pay for it later before taking the pen. The shopkeeper praised, "The People's Liberation Army has such good discipline. If it were the Kuomintang army, they wouldn't even pay for it, they would just snatch it!" When troops stationed in Xincun ate, they borrowed chopsticks and bowls from the landlord. After using them, they washed them clean and immediately returned them to the owner.

　　塘大我军严守纪律博得群众热烈拥护
    【天津电】解放塘大的人民解放军某部，严格执行保护新收复城市政策，纪律严明，得到群众热烈拥护。我军于十六日夜，扫清残敌，进驻塘大后，即时派卫兵分赴各工厂、医院、仓库、学校门口站岗守护。某部到达全国著名的永利制碱股份有限公司时，即派出卫兵站岗护厂，战士们都在场外休息，没有一个进入机器厂和工房的。我军购买物品，都是先付清款子，然后取东西。十八日一个同志在永发楼文具店已把钢笔买好，一掏口袋没有带钱来，遂向掌柜讲好，把钢笔先放下，一会把钱交清，再把钢笔取走，掌柜称赞说：“人民解放军纪律太好了，这要是国民党军队根本他就不给钱，抢还抢不到手呢！”驻新村部队吃饭时向房东借来筷子、碗，使完刷洗得干干净净，马上交还原主。
