Criticism and Suggestions

　　Hoping the Government Will Strengthen the Work of Closing Mountains for Forest Protection
    In W窯 Village, Sixth District, Fuping County, there is a timber forest that was previously controlled by landlords. The timber trees on the mountain were dense and the leaves were thick and covered the sky. Now, in order to develop and protect forestry, the government has specifically designated this area as a restricted forest area. First, to protect this famous mountain forest from ancient times to the present; second, to provide abundant timber resources for future building construction. However, the residents of the mountain not only do not try to protect it, but also secretly cut and sell it, and affect the whole village's large-scale logging of trees. After the government discovered this, it immediately sent people to prohibit it, and now more than 850 rafters have been found. In addition to continuing to search for private caches, Hu Nankan, Liu Yuansheng and others have been handed over to the democratic government for legal processing. I hope the government will think of some more specific ways to educate the masses to cherish trees.

　　希望政府加强禁山护林工作
    阜平县第六区瓦窑村有一座材树林子，过去为地主所掌握，山上的材林密集如麻，叶茂遮天。现在为了发展和保护林业，政府特把这里划成禁林区。一来为保护这座自古到今的名胜山林；二来是为将来建筑房屋的丰富材源。然而该山居民不但不设法保护，反而偷砍出卖，并影响全村大量砍伐树木。这事政府发现后即马上派人去禁止，现已查出八百五十余条椽子。除继续搜查私藏外，已经把胡南看、刘元生等送交民主政府依法处理。我希望政府再想些具体办法，教育群众爱护林木。
