　　【Hejian City News】Since the Hebei Central Trade Union proposed correcting "leftist" deviations in labor-management relations in its May 1st proposal, most public enterprises have rectified their policies. However, private industrial and commercial enterprises have seen serious violations of the economic and political rights of workers and apprentices. Regarding violations of economic interests: wages are too low, and many factories have not signed wage contracts, making it impossible to resolve issues when they arise. Those with contracts use them as another means of highly exploiting workers. For example, the Sanxiang Wood Factory, starting from the first month of the lunar year, stipulated: workers provide their own tools, and wages are between 1,000 and 5,000 yuan. Prices have since increased three to four times, but wages have not changed; furthermore, there is no specified date for wage payments, so the later workers receive their money, the more they lose. Workers sent by the factory to work in households earn 15,000 yuan with room and board provided by the household, but their wages are still calculated at 5,000 yuan, with the capitalist pocketing 10,000 yuan. Some factory managers believe that apprentices do not need to be paid, so they take on more apprentices and use fewer workers. For example, at the Jiuxing Iron Factory, four out of six people are apprentices; furthermore, working hours are too long. In the autumn, they get up at 6 a.m. to work and do not rest until 10 p.m., working about fourteen hours a day, excluding two hours for two meals (according to government regulations, small businesses that cannot immediately shorten working hours should not exceed twelve hours). This has caused some apprentices to vomit blood from exhaustion. Regarding the length of apprenticeship, for example, at the Yongli Vehicle Shop, it is nominally two and a half years, but secretly four years (note: government regulations stipulate a maximum of three years). Some still have many old traditional regulations, such as the Qingyi Sock Factory, which stipulates that apprentices who leave before completing their apprenticeship must compensate for food expenses.
    Regarding violations of the political rights of workers and apprentices: some factories deprive workers and apprentices of their basic right to join trade unions. For example, Ma Fushun, manager of the Sanxiang Wood Factory, said: "Anyone who joins the trade union will not be allowed to work in the factory." "No one should join the trade union; the trade union will ask you to be a soldier." Some allow workers to join the trade union but do not allow them to attend meetings. Some still have old punishment systems. For example, at the Yongli Vehicle Shop, an apprentice was falsely accused of stealing money, beaten, and forced to kneel; at the Farmer's Iron Factory, an apprentice was scolded for singing an opera when he was happy. These phenomena are remnants of the feudal era, and they affect workers' production morale.

### 不订立工资契约剥夺了政治权利

　　不订立工资契约剥夺了政治权利
    【河间市讯】冀中职工会在劳资问题上从“五一”提出纠正“左”倾偏向以来，大部分公营企业刻己端正政策。而私营工商业则产生了严重的侵犯工人、学徒的经济利益和政治权利现象。在侵犯经济利益方面：工资过低，许多工厂都未订立工资契约，发生问题后没法解决。有契约的却是另一种高度剥削工人的手段。如三乡木厂，从正月起订立：工人自备工具，工资是一千元至五千元，至今物价已上升三四倍，工资仍未变动；并且还不规定支付工资日期，工人支钱越晚，吃亏也就越大；由工厂派出去给住家户作工的工人，由住户管饭，挣回一万五千元，工资仍按五千元算，资方反而白拿一万元。有的工厂经理觉得学徒可以不给工资，就多带徒弟少用工人，如久兴铁工厂，六人中就有四个学徒；且工作时间过长，秋天早上六点起床工作，至晚十时才歇工睡觉，除去吃两顿饭的两个钟头外，每日作工在十四小时左右（按政府规定一时无法缩短工作时间的小企业，最多不得超过十二小时），致使有的学徒累的吐了血。在学徒年限上，如永利车行，明是二年半，暗中却是四年（按：政府法令最多不得超过三年）。有的尚有许多旧的传统规定，如庆义袜厂，规定学不满徒而中途出柜者倒赔粮款。
    在侵犯工人、学徒的政治权利上：有的工厂就把工人、学徒参加工会的基本权利都剥夺了，如三乡木厂经理马福顺说：“谁参加工会就不让谁在厂里作工。”“谁也别参加工会，工会要你去当兵。”有的让参加了工会，却不让去开会。有的尚存有旧的惩罚制度，如永利车行，污赖学徒偷钱，打了一顿还要罚跪；农民铁工厂的学徒，高兴的时候唱了唱戏，就挨了一顿骂。这些现象都是封建时代的遗留，它影响了工人的生产情绪。
