　　Militia Instructor of Shayingzi, Ci County, after returning from a meeting in the county, talked to individual militiamen to understand their thoughts and the existing problems. Initially, everyone thought talking was useless. The instructor said, "As long as everyone speaks out, we will definitely find a way to solve it." So, the militiamen brought up: "We can't sleep well guarding the night, and we can't produce well during the day. Losing work every night is a big problem." Everyone discussed this problem and later came up with a solution: the militiamen sleep collectively in the team headquarters and take turns on guard duty, while helping each other to solve production difficulties. The specific approach was to find three militiamen who knew how to weave straw cages and have them help three who didn't. When those who knew how to weave were on guard duty, those who didn't would take their place. If neither was on guard duty, they would learn from each other. After five nights of such mutual assistance, they wove three cages and ten straw beaters, earning a total of 336 new currency units, an average of 67 silver dollars per night. Each person could earn 11 silver dollars per night. Later, two militiamen helped each other to fire bricks, make sun-dried bricks, and sell oil at the kiln, which solved the difficulty of the militiamen fearing to lose work and the contradiction in work, and everyone's morale was boosted.

　　磁县边地民兵轮流站岗互助生产
    【太行讯】磁县沙营子民兵指导员从县开会回去，个别和民兵谈心思了解民兵思想存在的问题。起初大家认为谈不谈不顶事。指导员说：“只要大家谈出，一定要想法来解决。”于是民兵提出：“咱们黑夜站岗放哨睡不好，白天也不能好好生产，每天黑夜误工就是个大问题，大家对此问题展开讨论，后来想出了一个办法：即民兵在队部集体睡觉，轮流站岗，同时互助起来解决生产困难。具体做法是在民兵中找了三个会用麦杆编草笼的，和三个不会的互助起来。轮到会编的站岗时，不会编的便替他站岗。如都不该站时，便互相学习。经过这样的五夜互助。编笼头三个、草拍子十个，共赚新币三百三十六元，每夜平均赚洋六十七元。每人每夜可分洋十一元。后有两个民兵，互助起来在窑上烧砖、阴砖和卖油等，解决了民兵怕误工和工作矛盾的困难，大家情绪高起来。
