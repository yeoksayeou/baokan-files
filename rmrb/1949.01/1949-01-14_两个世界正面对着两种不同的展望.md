In the New Year of 1949, two worlds are facing two completely different prospects.

In the Soviet Union, a picture of thriving economy and increasingly abundant people's lives is presented. In 1948, industrial production had exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 17 percent. In light industry, the production of consumer goods such as shoes, socks, clothes, coats, and shirts increased by two and a half times in the past two years compared to 1946, with some increasing by as much as fifteen times. In order to further increase the production of consumer goods to improve people's lives, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order on December 28 to merge the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Textile Industry into the Ministry of Light Industry. In agriculture, the total grain harvest has reached the level of pre-war 1940. The great plan to create forest protection zones, conquer drought, and ensure bumper harvests every year will be vigorously carried out in 1949.

In the new democratic countries of Southeastern Europe, preparations are being made for a longer-term, planned, and step-by-step transition to socialism. Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have successfully completed their two-year economic plans and have formulated new five-year economic plans. The Bulgarian National Assembly unanimously passed the five-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1949 to 1953 on December 29. According to Te Bishev, Chairman of the Bulgarian National Planning Committee, "The main goal of the five-year plan is to build the socialist foundation of Bulgaria." The second year (1948) of Poland's three-year economic recovery plan has achieved significant success. Industrial production has exceeded the 1947 level by more than 40 percent, and the total production of state-owned industries and cooperatives in the socialist sector of industry has accounted for 94 percent of the total industrial production. The agricultural harvest has also reached the pre-war level. At the same time, the Polish government has drafted a new six-year economic plan to "lay the foundation for socialism." In addition, Romania passed its first post-war economic plan at the end of last year, with the aim of "establishing all the necessary prerequisites for Romania to build socialism" (TASS). Hungary is widely launching a labor emulation campaign across the country to complete the three-year plan in two years and five months.

These new economic plans of the new democratic countries to "establish a socialist foundation" have the following common characteristics: (1) Further develop state-owned industries, especially heavy industry, greatly increase the proportion of the state-owned economy in the entire economy, transform the country into an industrialized and advanced country, and create the necessary conditions for the mechanization of agriculture. Bulgaria's new five-year plan stipulates maximizing the development of heavy industry, increasing the production of electricity, coal, and mineral seedlings, and rapidly developing the steel, machine manufacturing, and chemical industries. The plan also stipulates that "by the end of 1953, the socialist form will dominate all sectors of the Bulgarian national economy." Poland's new six-year plan stipulates that the fastest rate of industrial expansion will be the production of basic means of production and steel. Tractor production, which is the basis for agricultural mechanization, will increase sixfold. At the same time, a modern chemical industry will be built to make it the second largest industry in Poland after the coal mining industry. Polish Minister of Industry Mintz pointed out: "It is impossible to build socialism in six years," but he also clearly pointed out: "In six years, the foundation of socialism will be laid," so that capitalist factors "will not play a decisive role in any economic field." The total investment in the budget of Romania's 1949 economic plan reached 82 billion lei, of which 36 percent was used to develop heavy industry and coal mining industry. (2) Systematically organize agricultural production and improve agricultural technology in order to develop agriculture and improve farmers' lives, and ensure that industry has a sufficient source of raw materials and a market. In the new economic plans of Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania, the following tasks are clearly stipulated: equip agriculture with a large number of machines and tools, expand and consolidate state-owned farms, and organize, develop, and consolidate cooperatives. (3) Improve and raise the people's material living standards and cultural and technical level. Romania's economic plan stipulates that the amount of bread people receive in 1949 will increase by 70 percent compared to last year, and the distribution of meat products will increase by 110 percent. At the same time, the plan also stipulates to increase nurseries and kindergartens by 40 percent, open 190 new technical schools, and establish 400 rural cinemas, etc.

However, in the capitalist countries on the other side of the world, the situation is completely opposite. The United States is welcoming the New Year in a situation of economic turmoil, instability, people's suffering, and soaring unemployment. The Western European countries are "continuing to struggle in contradictions and difficulties" (New Times). The United Kingdom formulated a so-called four-year economic plan before the year that could not be fulfilled, and wanted to use "US aid" and specially reduce the living conditions of the working class in order to balance the budget within four years. But even this plan admits that if "everything is fine" by the end of 1949, it will only be "possible to see what the future holds." France passed an unprecedentedly large 1949 budget of more than 1,860 billion francs at the end of last year, of which military expenditure accounted for 40 percent of the total budget. This budget marks a greater disaster for the French people. Because this budget mainly relies on the large-scale plunder of the French working people. According to Agence France-Presse, "This budget will be paid for by 1,400 billion francs of new taxes, 100 billion francs of public debt, and other methods."

The Ruhr issue conference secretly convened in London in mid-November last year by the six countries of the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has ended after more than a month. The meeting decided to establish so-called Ruhr "international control bureau" and other institutions, whose powers are limited to the distribution of Ruhr industrial products. But even this power is still manipulated by the United States and Britain, because they are stipulated to have three votes each in the "control bureau." The meeting also concluded a secret agreement, that is, Britain and France have succumbed to the pressure of the United States and obediently agreed to rearm Western Germany "at an appropriate time." These resolutions of the Ruhr conference completely excluded the control rights of countries other than the United States and Britain over the Ruhr, and stripped the Ruhr, the industrial center of coal, iron, and other industries, from Germany, completely annexed it by the United States, and turned it into a base and arsenal for US imperialism to prepare for war. This is another step by US and British imperialism to dismember Germany and rearm Germany.

After the illegal agreement of the Ruhr Conference was announced, the German people have risen up against it. The Presidium of the German People's Committee issued a strong protest statement, calling on the people of the whole of Germany to "strengthen the fight against splitters and war vendors." The Central Bureau of the German Socialist Unity Party, in its New Year's message to the working people, denounced the crimes of the United States, Britain, and France in splitting Germany, and summoned "striving for German unification," "striving for peace, democracy, and socialism."

Other important international events in the past week are as follows:

(1) Indonesian people's guerrillas and some of the Republic's troops who insisted on resistance are launching extensive guerrilla warfare against the Dutch aggressors in vast rural areas, forests, and mountainous regions. The Dutch aggressors, under the shelter of US and British imperialism, announced on the 2nd that they would implement a "ceasefire" throughout Java after completing their plan to occupy all the cities of Java. The World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Student Union, dockworkers in Denmark and Australia, and students in the Netherlands and India protested the aggression of Dutch imperialism and supported the liberation movement of the Indonesian people through protest statements and demonstrations.

(2) The Soviet troops stationed in North Korea have completely withdrawn on December 25 last year. However, the United States has so far refused to withdraw its troops stationed in South Korea. The United States and its running dog Kuomintang government have successively recognized the Lee Seung-man puppet government fostered by the United States.

### 两个世界正面对着两种不同的展望

专栏：国际一周

　　两个世界正面对着两种不同的展望
    在一九四九年的新年中，两个世界正在面对着两种完全不同的展望。
    在苏联，呈现着一幅经济蒸蒸日上和人民生活更加丰足的图画。一九四八年的工业生产，已超过战前一九四○年水平的百分之十七。轻工业的鞋、袜、衣服、外套和衬衣等消费品生产，去年前年两年与一九四六年比较，少的增加了两倍半，多的增加了十五倍。苏联最高苏维埃主席团为了进一步增加消费品生产，以提高人民的生活，已于十二月二十八日发布命令，将轻工业部与纺织工业部合并组成轻工业部。在农业方面，谷物的总收获量，已达到战前一九四○年的数量。创建森林防护地带、征服旱灾、保证年年丰收的伟大计划，在一九四九年将以大力进行。
    在东南欧新民主各国，正准备在一个较长的时期内，有计划有步骤地过渡到社会主义。捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚两国，已胜利完成两年经济计划，并已制订了新的五年经济计划。保加利亚国民议会已于十二月二十九日一致通过了自一九四九年至一九五三年发展国民经济的五年计划，据保国国家计划委员会主席特比舍夫谈称：“五年计划的主要目的，在于建设保国的社会主义基础。”波兰三年经济复兴计划的第二年（一九四八年），已获得重大成就。工业生产已超过一九四七年水准的百分之四十以上，工业中社会主义部分的国营工业和合作社的总生产量，已占全部工业总生产量的百分之九十四。农业方面的收获量亦已达到战前水平。同时，波兰政府已拟就了“奠定社会主义基础”的新六年经济计划。此外，罗马尼亚于去年底通过了战后第一个经济计划，目的在于为罗国“建立社会主义取得一切必要的先决条件”（塔斯社）。匈牙利则正在全国广泛展开在二年五个月中完成三年计划的劳动竞赛热潮。
    这些新民主主义国家为“建立社会主义基础”的新经济计划，有着这样几个共同的特点：（一）进一步发展国营工业，特别是重工业，大大增加国营经济在整个经济中的比重，使国家变成工业化的先进国家，并为农业的机械化创造必要的条件。保加利亚的新五年计划规定最大限度地发展重工业，增加电力、煤和矿苗的生产，迅速发展钢铁、机器制造和化学工业。计划并规定“到一九五三年底时，社会主义形态将在保国国民经济的一切部门中占据优势”。波兰的新六年计划规定工业扩展速度最快的，将是基本生产手段和钢铁的生产。为农业机械化之基础的拖拉机生产，将激增六倍。同时将建设一个现代化的化学工业，使它成为仅次于采煤工业的波兰第二大工业。波兰工业部长明兹曾指出：“要在六年内建设社会主义是不可能的”，但他同时明确指出：“在六年内将奠定社会主义的基础”，将使资本主义因素“在任何经济领域中都起不了决定作用”。罗马尼亚一九四九年经济计划的预算中的投资总额，共达八百廿亿罗币，其中百分之三十六用在发展重工业和采煤工业上。（二）有计划地组织农业生产和提高农业技术，以便发展农业和改善农民生活，保证工业具有充足的原料来源和市场。在波、保、罗三国的新经济计划中，都明确规定了如下的任务：以大量的机器和工具装备农业，扩大和巩固国营农场，组织、发展和巩固合作社。（三）改善和提高人民的物质生活和文化、技术水平。罗马尼亚的经济计划规定，人民在一九四九年所得的面包，将较去年增加百分之七十，肉类食品的分配增加百分之一百一十。同时，计划又规定增加百分之四十的托儿所和幼稚园，开设一百九十所新的技术学校，设立四百家乡村电影院等等。
    但是，在世界另一角的资本主义国家，情形却完全相反。美国是在经济动荡不稳、人民困苦和失业激增的情况下来迎接新年的。西欧各国则“继续在矛盾和困难中挣扎”（新时代）。英国于年前制定了不能兑现的所谓四年经济计划，想以利用“美援”和特别降低工人阶级的生活条件等办法，以便在四年内平衡预算。但就连这个计划书亦承认如果到一九四九年年底时“一切情形良好”，也仅仅是“将有可能看清前途如何”。法国在去年底通过了一万八千六百余亿法郎空前庞大的一九四九年度预算案，其中军费竟占全部预算的百分之四十。这一预算标志着法国人民将遭受更大的灾难。因为这一预算主要靠向法国劳动人民实行的大掠夺。据法新社透露：“这项预算将以一万四千亿法郎新税、一千亿法郎公债等办法来支付。”
    美英法荷比卢六国去年十一月中旬在伦敦私下召开的鲁尔问题会议，在开了一个多月以后已经结束。会议决定成立所谓鲁尔“国际管制局”等机构，其职权则仅限于对鲁尔工业生产品的分配。但即使这一职权仍为美英两国所操纵，因为它们在“管制局”中，被规定各有三票的权力。会议尚订有一项密约，即英法已屈服于美国的压力，俯首贴耳地同意在“适当时机”重行武装西部德国。鲁尔会议的这些决议，完全排斥了美英以外各国对鲁尔的管制权，使德国这一煤铁等工业中心的鲁尔从德国挖掉，完全为美国所吞并，变成了美国帝国主义准备战争的基地和兵工厂。这正是美英等帝国主义肢解德国和重新武装德国的又一步骤。
    鲁尔会议的非法协定公布后，德国人民已奋起反对。德国人民委员会主度团发表强烈的抗议声明，号召全德人民“加强对分裂分子和战争贩子的抗击”。德国统一社会党中央局在其新年告劳动人民书中，痛斥美英法分裂德国的罪行，召唤“争取德国统一”，“争取和平、民主和社会主义”。
    过去一周国际间其他重要事件如下：
    （一）印尼人民游击队和一部分坚持抵抗的共和国军队，正在广大乡村、森林和山岳地区，向荷兰侵略军展开广泛的游击战。在美英帝国主义庇护下的荷兰侵略者，在完成其占领爪哇一切城市的计划后，竟于二日宣布在爪哇全境实行“停战”。世界职工联盟、国际学生联盟、丹麦和澳洲的码头工人和荷兰、印度的学生，以抗议声明及示威游行等行动，声讨荷兰帝国主义的侵略罪行，支援印尼人民的解放运动。
    （二）驻北朝鲜的苏军已于去年十二月二十五日全部撤退完毕。但美国迄今仍拒绝撤退其南朝鲜的驻军。对于美国一手扶植起来的李承晚傀儡政府，美国及其走狗国民党政府，已先后予以承认。
