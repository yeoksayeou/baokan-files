　　Women of Heyan Village Burning the Midnight Oil to Make Military Shoes
　　[Taihang News] After hearing the victory news during the current affairs propaganda campaign, the women of Heyan Village in the Seventh District of Zuoquan County have become even more fond of our army. They are especially proactive in making shoes this time. Pei Hezi rushed back from her mother's house after hearing about the military shoe assignment, saying, "Our army is fighting the enemy at the front all day long, and victory is in sight. What are we waiting for if we don't come back to make shoes for the army?" Cao Qiaohua said, "Our army is fighting the enemy at the front, we can't let them go barefoot." All the women in the village launched a competition to see who could make the sturdiest and best-looking shoes, working late into the night. (Pei Zhen)
　　[Taihang News] On December 11th, the Second District Government of Heshun County assigned 145 pairs of military shoes to be made by the women of Niuchuan Village. Anti-Japanese and women cadres discussed how to complete the task: if two people made one pair, there would be more shoes than people; if one person made one pair, there would be more people than shoes. Unable to resolve the issue, they convened a women's congress for discussion. Liu Qiaoni said, "People are fighting fiercely at the front, what is it to us to make a pair of shoes in the rear?" Several military dependents said, "Isn't this also for our men? When our men are at home, one pair a year is not enough." During the discussion, Guo Laihua, chairwoman of the Women's Federation, Li Sanni, Liu Qiaoni, Feng Cundi, representatives of the People's Congress and villagers Feng Gaidi and others, 43 people in all, volunteered to make an extra pair. The remaining people made one pair together, and the assignment was completed voluntarily. They also automatically discussed and put forward four slogans: (1) Make shoes strong, ensuring that the uppers and soles do not separate. (2) Everyone will inspect the shoes upon collection, and models will be evaluated. (3) Complete the task on time and send them to the front lines. (4) Let the soldiers wear the shoes and defeat the bandit Chiang Kai-shek. After the meeting, the women busily started making shoes.

　　壑岩村妇女赶夜做军鞋
    【太行讯】左权七区壑岩村全村妇女，在这次时事宣传中听了胜利消息后，对咱的军队更热爱。特别在这次做鞋时，大家更积极。裴荷子听说派来军鞋，就从娘家忙赶回来，她说：“咱们军队整天在前方和敌人作战，眼看就要胜利啦，叫咱给军队做双鞋，咱不回来做还等甚”。曹巧花说：“咱们军队在前方打敌，人可不能叫他们赤着脚”。全村妇女提出了比扎实、比样子的竞赛，恋明赶夜的做起来了。　　（培真）
    【太行讯】十二月十一日，和顺二区区政府给牛川村妇女派预做军鞋一百四十五双，抗勤与妇女干部研究如何完成：如二人一双，鞋多人少；一人一双，人多鞋少。没法解决，便召开妇女大会讨论。刘巧妮说：“人家在前方钢钢打仗，咱在后方做一双鞋算啥”。有好几个军属女人说：“这还不是给咱男人做咧，咱男人不在前方打仗，在家时一年一双可不够。”在讨论中，妇女会主席郭来花，人代会代表李三妮、刘巧妮、冯存弟与村民冯改弟等四十三人，都自报多做一双，余下的两人做一双，没派就自报完了。并自动讨论提出四个口号：（一）做鞋要结实，保证不让帮、底分家。（二）收鞋大家看，还要评模范。（三）按期要完成，送到前线上。（四）战士穿上鞋，打倒贼老蒋。会后，妇女们便忙碌的赶做起来。
