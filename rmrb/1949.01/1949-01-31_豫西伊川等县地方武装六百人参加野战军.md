Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 24th. More than six hundred local armed personnel from Yichuan, Yinan (newly established county, southern Yiyang), and other counties gloriously joined the People's Liberation Army field army. During reorganization and training, all commanders and fighters of the Yichuan County Independent Regiment, after ideological education, unanimously requested to join the field army. The Party, government, and military leadership organs of the county immediately approved the glorious transfer of 360 personnel to the field army. The first group of more than 250 local armed personnel from Yinan County were also honorably promoted to the field army. On January 5th, Party, government, military, and civilian organizations at all levels, along with more than 3,000 students from Yichuan County, held a special gathering to bid farewell to the upgraded soldiers. When the upgraded soldiers entered the venue, gongs and drums resounded, cheers erupted, and the masses applauded in celebration. The representative of the People's Government made a guarantee to the upgraded soldiers: "When you go to the front, the government and the masses will take care of your families, so don't worry." The Central Plains Daily specially published a short commentary on this, calling on local armed forces in various counties to learn from them. The commentary also emphasized: Only by strengthening the field army can we finally and completely eliminate the remaining enemies, and can our hometowns and property be permanently guaranteed.
