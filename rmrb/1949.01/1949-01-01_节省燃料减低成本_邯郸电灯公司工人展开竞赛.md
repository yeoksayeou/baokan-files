　　Saving Fuel and Reducing Costs
　　Handan Electric Light Company Workers Launch Competition
　　[Handan News] Since its opening, the Handan Electric Light Company has, through the active efforts of all its employees, overcome all difficulties and ensured the city's timely electricity supply. However, because not enough attention was paid to fuel conservation in the past, waste was unavoidable. For example, in the burnt-out cinders, there was still a lot of black coal, which was discarded without being picked out. At the same time, the bottom of the furnace was cleaned too frequently, and a lot of fuel was lost (according to inspections, an extra cleaning resulted in a loss of 300 catties of coal). After discovering these problems, the leadership called on employees to save fuel. Manager Wang Zhiqin often personally went to the boiler room to inspect, and the employees actively responded to the call. For example, the two groups of workers in the boiler room automatically launched a competition to see who could burn more economically. In particular, Song Kezong's group was more active, encouraging each other to pick out cinders and improve their firing techniques. All the workers in the group kept track of the amount of coal burned every day, afraid that their group would waste coal. Zheng Shukuai's group had not yet figured out the idea at first, thinking that saving money had nothing to do with them. Later, after education and inspection by the leadership, they gradually changed their attitude and automatically suggested to the leadership that the cinders should be left in the boiler room first, and then pulled out after being cleaned, which saved a lot of time.

　　节省燃料减低成本
  　邯郸电灯公司工人展开竞赛
    【邯郸讯】本市电灯公司，自开工以来，虽经全体职工的积极努力，克服了一切困难，保证了全市的准时用电，但因过去对燃料节省上重视不够，所以仍不免产生浪费现象，象烧过的乏炭中，还有不少黑炭，没有拣出来就随便抛弃了，同时烧火时清炉底次数太勤，燃料上也受到不少损失（据检查多清一回，就损失三百斤炭）。领导上发现这些问题后，就号召职工一定节省燃料，经理王志清同志，常亲自到锅炉房检查，职工们也积极响应号召，象锅炉房的两组工人，自动发起竞赛，看谁烧得节省，特别是宋克宗那一组表现得更积极，互相勉励拣乏炭，提高烧火技术，全组工人自己天天都记着烧炭数目，光怕本组把炭浪费。郑树奎那一组，开始思想还没弄通，认为省费与自己没关系，后来经过领导上教育和检查，也慢慢改变了态度，自动建议领导上，把乏炭先留在锅炉房，拣清以后再拉出来，这样节省的时间不少。
