　　【Taiyuan Front Telegram】 (Delayed) A certain local independent brigade, commended by the First Corps Headquarters of the North China Field Army in a circular, consecutively captured Zhoujiashan, an important stronghold of the Yan bandit forces north of Taiyuan city, and 18 other strongholds in the first stage of the Taiyuan Campaign, annihilating more than three regiments of the defending enemy, and capturing 23 mortars and heavy infantry guns. It successfully completed and exceeded the planned tasks, demonstrating that the brigade has greatly improved in its development from guerrilla warfare to regular warfare.

　　The first characteristic of this brigade's operation is its ability to continuously collect and study the enemy situation during continuous combat, to be good at discovering and utilizing the enemy's weaknesses, and to be bold, courageous, and to achieve victory through unexpected tactics. In the Huangzhai battle on November 1st, in addition to the main force attacking the enemy from the northwest and southeast, a battalion of troops rapidly and covertly passed through a mile-long deep ditch and an open area within the southwestern bunker line, the area that the enemy considered the most fortified and where our army dared not pass. By the time the enemy discovered them, the troops had already reached the village. Then, they quickly occupied and consolidated the position, attacking bravely from inside out in coordination with the main force, cutting off and surrounding the enemy. While applying military pressure, they also strived to disintegrate the enemy. Through this combination of military "heart-digging" tactics and political "mind-attacking" tactics, they achieved a major victory of completely annihilating a regiment of defending enemies with relatively small casualties of a dozen people. In the battle to capture Zhoujiashan, the location of the Yan bandit's Northern Taiyuan Defense Bunker Headquarters, on November 6th, a certain regiment first cleared the periphery and launched a fierce attack from the east, drawing the enemy's main force to the front. At this time, discovering that the enemy's rear was already empty, the regiment detoured to the enemy's flank and launched a sudden and fierce attack from the west towards the enemy's weak rear. A battalion captured several bunkers in succession, occupying an important commanding height. The enemy's defense bunker commander and chief officers, including the commander and deputy regimental commanders, were caught off guard and fled south in a panic. Just as they ran to the No. 13 command bunker, the 2nd Battalion immediately launched another attack. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the soldiers used bayonets to dig ladders in the communication trenches, climbed over the trenches, and advanced towards the bunkers, compressing the enemy into a cave. The enemy command organization, from the defense bunker commander down to 98 people, first surrendered their weapons in an organized manner. This fortified stronghold, built by the Yan bandits with more than 110 large and small bunkers, directly commanded by the Northern Defense Bunker Commander with a regiment of troops defending it, was completely resolved in one day and one night due to the brigade's flexible tactics and courageous actions. Second, they are good at combining political "mind-attacking" tactics with powerful military force. They strictly implemented the policy on prisoners of war, and used these concrete examples to patiently and sincerely explain the policies of our party and our army to the liberated soldiers, pointing out the current situation, telling them that laying down their weapons was the way to survive, and utilizing the role of the liberated soldiers on the spot. On October 25th, the brigade launched simultaneous attacks on the enemy in Qinglongzhen and Tadiqiao. They first captured a bunker southwest of Qinglong, capturing the defending enemy company commander Liu Ziheng and the intelligence chief Xu Liqing. Then they captured another bunker, capturing another company commander, Jin Yuting. In addition to Liu and others using their personal experiences to introduce our army's prisoner of war policy to Jin, the brigade leaders also personally spoke with him. Jin Yuting was deeply moved and immediately shed tears. Then, the three of them studied the current enemy situation together, organized themselves, and, under our army's strong cover and escort, went to the vicinity of the bunker where the enemy acting battalion commander was trapped to shout and persuade them to surrender. After they made contact with the enemy inside the bunker, they entered the bunker, specifically described their own experiences, and conveyed our army's order to immediately lay down their weapons. They said, "There is a commander outside now who is very good to us. The cannons are all set up, but they haven't fired yet because they are afraid of killing you." After their activities inside the bunker, coupled with our army's powerful force outside the bunker and the mass frontline shouting, the acting battalion commander and his two companies all laid down their weapons. Another liberated platoon leader, Feng Yunting, under the influence of our army's actual actions, actively participated in shouting at the enemy with our army. When the enemy was still hesitating, he ran into the bunker and said anxiously, "I have been waiting for you anxiously! Hurry up and surrender your guns, otherwise, you will all die in this bunker!" This accelerated the enemy's surrender process. In previous battles, the brigade truly realized the powerful battle slogan put forward by the corps: "Attack fiercely and disintegrate them, and the enemy will collapse quickly."

　　The regiments under the brigade were reorganized from guerrillas into local corps from last winter to this spring. In May of this year, in crushing the Yan bandit's invasion of the Zhengtai Line, they annihilated most of the First Regiment of the 49th Division of the Yan bandits, achieving a major victory for the first time. Then, they participated in the Jinzhong Campaign, actively cooperating with the main force in combat and gaining better training. However, at this time, the unit still had serious guerrilla habits and violations of policy and discipline, and at the same time had some concerns about siege warfare. After the Jinzhong Campaign, a new type of rectification movement was carried out. First, in conjunction with post-war commendation and combat review, a mass political rectification movement was launched, focusing on resolving policy and discipline issues. Many cadres and soldiers have realized the profound truth from their own experience that "without policy and discipline, we cannot win battles." At the same time, the leadership of the Party committees at all levels was strengthened in the movement, and the Party's prestige in the troops was enhanced. On the basis of these tasks, combined with current affairs education, the glorious task of capturing Taiyuan was specifically put forward, and then a military training movement was carried out with the goal of improving siege warfare capabilities. Therefore, this brigade was able to achieve such significant results in this operation.

　　某独立旅学会正规作战
  　在太原战役中连克重要据点十九处
    荣获华北野战军第一兵团表扬
  　猛打加瓦解　敌人垮的快
    【太原前线电】（迟到）荣获华北野战军第一兵团司令部通令表扬的某地方独立旅，在太原战役第一阶段作战中，连克太原城北阎匪重要据点周家山及其他据点十九处，歼灭守敌三个多团，缴获迫击炮及步重炮二十三门，胜利完成并超过了预定任务，表现该旅从游击作战到正规作战的发展过程中，已经大大提高了一步。
    该旅这次作战的第一个特点，就是能够在连续作战中不断收集研究敌情，善于发现与利用敌人弱点，果敢勇猛，出奇致胜。十一月一日黄寨战斗，除以主力从西北与东南向敌攻击外，另以一个营的兵力，在西南两岸碉堡线当中，即敌人认为最坚固、我军不敢通过的地方，迅速隐蔽地通过了一里来地的一条深沟与一片开阔地，等到敌人发觉，部队已到了村里。然后迅速占领与巩固阵地，从里向外配合主力勇猛攻击，把敌人割裂包围，一面施以军事压力，一面争取瓦解，在这种军事上的挖心战术与政治上攻心战相结合之下，以十几个人的较小伤亡，取得全歼守敌一团兵力的重大胜利。十一月六日，在攻克阎匪太原北区守碉司令部所在地周家山的战斗中，某团首先扫清外围，从东猛攻，把敌人主力吸引到正面后，这时发觉敌人后方已经空虚，乃以某团绕到敌人侧后，从西往东向着敌人薄弱的后方突然猛攻。一营连下数碉，占领一个重要制高点后，敌守碉司令及正副团长等主要军官措手莫及，慌忙向南溃退，正当他们跑到十三号指挥碉的时候，二营部队马上又发起攻击。在猛烈炮火掩护下，战士们用刺刀在交通壕内挖成梯子，爬过交通壕，向着碉堡猛进，把敌人压缩到一个窑洞里面。敌人指挥机关，从守碉司令以下九十八人，首先有组织地放下了武器。这个阎匪筑有一百一十多个大小碉堡，由北区守碉司令直接指挥一团兵力在此困守的坚固据点，由于该旅战术灵活与动作勇猛，前后一天一夜就全部解决了战斗。第二、善于把政治上的攻心战与强大军事威力相结合。严格执行了俘虏政策，并以这些具体实例，向解放官兵耐心诚恳地解释我党我军政策，指出目前形势，告诉他们放下武器就是活路，并就地发挥了解放官兵的作用。十月二十五日，该旅向青龙镇与塔地桥的敌人同时发起攻击，首先打下青龙西南一个碉堡，俘虏了守敌连长刘子恒与特务长徐立清。接着又打下一个碉堡，又俘虏了一个连长晋玉廷。这时除刘等以自己亲身经历，向晋介绍我军俘虏政策外，该旅首长亦亲自和他谈话，晋玉廷深为感动，当即掉下泪来。然后他们三个人就在一块研究当前敌人情况，并且组织起来，在我军有力掩护与陪同之下，到敌军代理营长所困守的碉堡附近喊话劝降。当他们与碉内敌人取得联系后，即走进碉堡，具体叙述自身经历及传达我军令其立即放下武器的命令。他们说：“现在外面有一个司令官，对我们很好。炮都已经架好了，因为怕把你们打死了，所以还没有打。”经过他们在碉堡内部的活动，再加上碉外我军强大威力与群众性的火线喊话，这个代理营长及其所属的两个连，全部放下了武器。另一个解放排长冯云廷，在我军实际行动影响下，亦随着我军积极参加对敌喊话，当敌人正在犹豫未决的时候，他跑进碉堡，着急地说：“我真把你们等的急死了，快缴枪吧，不然，马上都要死在这个碉堡里面！”加速了敌人放下武器的过程。该旅在历次战斗中，真正实现了兵团所提出的“猛打加瓦解，敌人垮的快”这一有力的战斗口号。
    按该旅所属各团，从去冬到今春才先后由游击队编为地方兵团。今年五月，在粉碎阎匪向正太线的进犯中，消灭阎匪四十九师第一团大部，首次取得较大战斗的胜利。接着就参加晋中战役，积极配合主力作战，得到更好锻炼，但这时部队游击习气与违犯政策纪律现象相当严重，同时对攻坚作战亦存有某些顾虑。晋中战役后，进行了新式整训运动。首先结合战后评功与战斗检讨，展开群众性的政治整训运动，着重解决政策纪律问题，许多干部战士已经从切身经验中认识到“没有政策纪律，就不能打胜仗”这一深刻道理。同时，在运动中加强各级党委领导，提高了党在部队的威信。在这些工作基础上，结合时事教育，具体提出攻取太原这一光荣任务，然后进行以提高攻坚作战能力为目标的军事练兵运动。因此，该旅这次作战，能获得如此重大战果。
