Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Reports from various sources: The Italian people held a movement to support Free Greece and the Democratic Army on the 9th of this month. This movement was initiated by the Italian "Support Free Greece Association" and democratic parties and groups. People in towns such as Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples, Venice, and Genoa, ignoring the prohibition and obstruction of the reactionary Gasperi government, held "Free Greece Day," mass rallies, and demonstrations. The chairman of the Greek Free Support Association, Communist Senator Trascini, delivered a speech to the demonstrating masses in Rome. Prior to this, Mr. Trascini had published an article in *Unità*, protesting the crimes of the Athens government and the attempt by American imperialism to suppress Free Greece. He called on the Italian people to unite with the Greek people who are fighting heroically for national independence and against foreign interference. An important part of "Free Greece Day" was raising the "Aid to the Greek Democratic Army Fund." Mass rallies in various places raised large amounts of money, food, clothing, and medicine to aid the Greek Democratic Army. In Milan alone, the working people raised one million lira (Italian currency). Many people participating in the conferences in Brindisi (southern Italy) and other places took off their warm clothes on the spot and donated them to the Democratic Army soldiers who are fighting for the independence, democracy, and freedom of Greece, and for world peace.

Also reported: The Romanian National Committee to Aid Greece has called for a campaign to support the Greek people by donating money, food, and clothing to the Greek people.

    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方报导：意大利人民于本月九日举行了支援自由希腊及民主军的运动。这一运动是由意大利“自由希腊后援会”及民主党派团体所发起的。罗马、米兰、都灵、那不勒斯、威尼斯、热那亚等城镇的人民，均不顾加斯贝利反动政府的禁止与阻挠，举行“自由希腊日”，举行群众大会及示威。希腊自由后援会主席、共产党参议员特拉西尼曾向罗马的示威群众发表演说。前此，特氏曾在团结报上发表专文，抗议雅典政府的罪行及美帝国主义镇压自由希腊的企图。他号召意大利人民，和为争取民族独立、反对外国干涉而英勇斗争的希腊人民团结一致。“自由希腊日”的一个重要项目是募集“援助希腊民主军基金”。各地的群众大会都募集了大量的金钱、食物，衣服和医药，援助希腊民主军。仅米兰一地的劳动人民，就募集了一百万里拉（意币）。布林的西（意大利南部）等地参加大会的许多人们，都当场脱下温暖的衣服，捐赠给为希腊的独立民主自由、为世界和平而战斗的民主军战士们。
    又讯：罗马尼亚援助希腊全国委员会业已号召展开支援希腊人民的运动，以金钱、粮食与衣服捐赠给希腊人民。
