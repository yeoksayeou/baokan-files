Regarding Matters Requiring Attention When Writing News Reports and Materials in Various Regions
    — Telegram from Xinhua News Agency Headquarters to All Branches

    Currently, various general and branch agencies have sent many resolutions, proclamations, decrees, editorials, and descriptions of meetings. These materials are very useful. Some of them, due to their important content and clear wording, can be broadcast and have already been broadcast. However, others are very dry and incomprehensible to other liberated areas, only suitable for reference by a small number of personnel in the central and leading organs, and not suitable for publication in newspapers or broadcasts. We hope that in the future, in addition to continuing to send these materials, you should focus on writing news reports. For the things you intend to publicize (including the materials you send), explain their background, their past situation, the problems that exist, the solutions, why they are being solved in this way, and the prospects for the future. In news reports, there must not only be ideological policies as the backbone, but also actual social life and vivid typical examples as flesh and blood. Only in this way can these news reports be understood by readers (from senior leading comrades of the Party to ordinary people), be willing to read, and be able to read. For example, the recent "Measures for Protecting and Rewarding the Cultivation of Forests" from the Shandong Provincial Government and the "Draft of the Conference of Provincial Bureau Chiefs Convened by the Northeast Grain Bureau" are both good and important in content.

    However, the former draft does not explain the status of the existence and destruction of public and private forests in Shandong, the direct benefits of forests and their help to agriculture, what problems have arisen in afforestation, forest protection, logging, burden, management, and land distribution, why the provincial government issued a proclamation, why it made this or that kind of regulation, what other work it has done besides issuing the proclamation, and what difficulties will be encountered in implementation. The latter draft also does not explain the situation and problems of the past methods of collecting, storing, distributing, allocating, transporting, and processing public grain in the Northeast, the ideological tendencies existing among cadres at all levels of the grain bureau and sub-bureaus, and why the grain conference was convened and various resolutions were made. Therefore, these two drafts are incomprehensible, cannot arouse the reader's interest, and cannot benefit them. Examples like this are too numerous to mention. We hope that you will raise this universal, serious, and urgent problem among the editors of the general and branch agencies and newspapers, conduct a thorough review, and take concrete measures to improve the quality of the Party's propaganda work, so as to use newspapers and broadcasts to strengthen the Party's connection with the masses. Please inform us of the progress of your implementation.

　　关于各地写新闻通讯及资料时应注意事项
    ——新华总社致各分社电
    现在各总分社发来很多决议、布告、法令、社论和会议的描写，这些资料都很有用，其中若干件因为内容重要，文字也明了，可以广播并已经广播了，但另有若干件则很枯燥，且为其他解放区所不能明了，仅能供中央及各领导机关少数人员参考，而不宜登报和广播。希望你们今后除仍继续发来这些资料外，要着重写新闻通讯，对于你们打算宣传的事物（包括你们发来的资料在内）说明它的背景，他的过去情况，存在的问题，解决的办法，为何要如此解决及前途的展望等。在新闻通讯中，不但必须有思想政策作骨干，而且必须有实际的社会生活和生动的典型例证作血肉。如此这些新闻通讯才是读者（从党的高级领导同志到普通老百姓）所能理解的，所愿意看和看得下去的。例如最近我们所收到的山东省政府保护及奖励培植林木办法，及东北粮食总局召开各省局长会议两稿，其内容都是好的也是重要的。
    但是前稿对于山东公私林木的存在与破坏状况如何？林木的直接收益与对农业的帮助作用如何，在造林、护林、采伐、负担、管理及在开荒分地中发生了一些什么问题，省政府为何要发布告，为何要作这一种或哪一种规定，除出布告外还作了一些什么工作，执行起来还会碰到什么困难等等，没有任何说明。后稿对于过去东北公粮的征收、保管、分配、调拨、运输、加工的办法状况与问题，各级粮食局、分局干部中存在的思想倾向以及何以要召集粮食会议并作出各项决议，也没有任何说明，因此，这两个稿件就是不可理解的，就不能引起读者的兴味，并使其获益，这种例子不胜枚举。望你们在各总分社及报社编辑人员中提出这个普遍的严重的迫切的问题，作一彻底检讨，并采取具体办法，以便改善党的宣传工作的质量，以便利用报纸和广播，加强党与群众的联系。你们执行的情形，望告。  　　　　　　　新华总社　亥鱼
