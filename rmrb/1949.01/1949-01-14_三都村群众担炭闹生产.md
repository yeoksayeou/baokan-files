[Taihang News] After the land reform in Sandu Village, Erqu District, Xiyang, a new atmosphere of unity and production emerged. The Party branch, based on the masses' urgent demands for production, on the one hand, examined the past shortcomings in production leadership, and on the other hand, actively organized the masses to carry out various productions. Party member Chen Laliang first opened an iron furnace, gathered more than ten people, and started production. Tian Xiaoming led the masses to carry coal to the furnace kiln, carrying it five times a night. Under the influence of Party members, more than sixty women and children were organized, divided into five groups for mining, coal digging, pole cutting, coal carrying, and firewood gathering, to supply raw materials to the furnace kiln. And seventy-eight people were organized in thirteen coal kilns, ten people in an alum kiln, and fourteen people refining saltpeter. The mining production alone organized one hundred and eighty-six laborers. In addition, more than three hundred people were organized to transport wooden planks on the road, earning seven silver dollars per trip, and bringing coal back to the furnace, making four round trips a day. About five hundred people in the whole village were engaged in production around the mining industry.

　　三都村群众担炭闹生产
    【太行讯】昔阳二区三都村结束土改后，呈现出团结生产的新气象。党的支部根据群众迫切的生产要求，一面检查了过去对生产领导不够，一面即积极将群众组织起来，进行各种生产。党员陈拉良首先开铁炉一座，集合十余人，开始生产。田小明带领群众往炉窑上担炭，一夜担五回。在党员的影响下，组织了妇女儿童六十余人，分行组成刨矿、刨煤、刨杆、担炭、打柴五个小组，供给炉窑的原料。并组织十三座煤窑七十八人。一个矾窑十人，熬硝十四人。光矿业生产即组织了一百八十六个劳力。另外又组织三百余人，往汽路上运道木，每人一回赚洋七元，回来捎炭给炉上，一天可往返四回。全村围绕着矿业进行生产的，约达五百人。
