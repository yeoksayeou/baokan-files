　　Parents Should Not Interfere with Children's Freedom of Marriage
    To the Editor:
    I am a 17-year-old female worker, determined to marry a cadre in our army. I have found an object of my affection, and I am very satisfied. He is from the Northeast, 28 years old this year, and he is very helpful to me, teaching me a lot of revolutionary principles.
    But my father's thinking is very stubborn. He doesn't want me to marry a soldier or someone from another province. I have no brothers, so he wants to keep me to support him in his old age. What do you say I should do? You serve the people, please tell me! Is what I'm doing legal? Please think of a way for me. In our village, there are many such cases.

    Answer: Now that you have found an object you are very satisfied with and want to marry, according to the principles of our new marriage system, which "advocates freedom of marriage for men and women," your union is correct. Marriage is voluntary on both sides and does not necessarily require parental consent (but can be discussed); if parental consent is required, it is not voluntary but constrained.
    In the old social marriage system, because marriage was not free, with arranged marriages, child brides, and buying and selling of spouses, there were many tragic phenomena of incompatible feelings, leading to suicide, divorce, family discord, and insecurity. The new marriage system advocates freedom of marriage for men and women, but it does not agree with some people handling their marriage problems rashly. Of course, incorrect male-female relationships should be opposed even more. The correct implementation of the new marriage system will not only bring a happy life to both men and women but also greatly help the development of the entire society. If your father disagrees with your opinion, you should patiently explain it to him.
    There are many such problems in your village. This is because the feudal ideas left to the masses by the old society are very deep, and our publicity and education on the new marriage system are insufficient. In the future, the government will pay attention to publicity and education and specifically help solve the problems, and this phenomenon will gradually disappear.

### 儿女姻婚自由父母不应干涉

　　儿女姻婚自由父母不应干涉
    编辑同志：
    我是一个十七岁的女工，下决心要嫁给咱们的军队干部，我找了个对象很是满意，他是东北人，今年二十八岁，他很能帮助我，教了我很多革命道理。
    可是我父亲思想很顽固，他不要我嫁给军队和外路人，我没有哥哥弟弟他想留住我养他的老，你们说这怎么办？你们是为人民服务的，告诉我吧！我这样做，合法吗？请你们给我想个法子。我们村里，象这样的事，是很多的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王翠红
    答：你现在已找到一个自己很满意的对象愿意嫁给他，按我们今天新的婚姻制度：“主张男女婚姻自由”的原则讲，你们的结合是正确的。结婚是由男女双方自愿，不一定要父母同意（但可以商量）；如果一定要父母同意，那便不是自愿，而是受束缚的。
    旧社会的婚姻制度，因为婚姻不自由，父母包办、童养、买卖等，以致双方感情不合，而造成自杀、离婚、家庭不合、生活不安的悲惨现象很多。新的婚姻制度，是主张男女婚姻自由的，但也不同意某些人，轻率潦草的处理自已婚姻的问题，至于那些不正确的男女关系，当然更应反对。新的婚姻制度的正确执行，不仅对男女双方会有美满的幸福的生活，对整个社会的发展也有很大帮助。你父亲不同意你的意见，要耐心地多加解释。
    你村这样的问题很多，这是由于旧社会给群众遗留下的封建思想很深，加上我们对新的婚姻制度宣传教育不够所致，今后政府注意宣传教育，并具体帮助解决，这种现象就会逐渐消除。
