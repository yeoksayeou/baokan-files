[Jinzhong Electric] To ensure the supply to the front lines and rigorously organize grain, firewood, and forage, the supply office of the Taiyuan Campaign Rear Command inspected the supply work and discovered that although the management stations had made great achievements in supporting the front lines, there were still many serious problems that needed to be improved: 1. Theft and embezzlement were not discovered and dealt with in a timely manner. Zhang Yougui, an accountant at the grain station of the First Office, embezzled 500 catties of rice coupons and exchanged them for rice to sell. Liu Gengming and Ren Xueqing from the transportation team of the Third Office stole a total of 740 catties of millet and 9 catties of white flour in four instances; they sold them cheaply and squandered them. Zhang Zijian, a cadre escorting a cart in Qi County, had civilian workers steal more than 30 catties of grain to exchange for sesame cakes to eat. Ren Changren, a militiaman escorting a cart in Jiaoshui, was caught stealing more than 80 catties of rice. Liang Tianbao, a civilian worker from Pingyao, was caught stealing more than 100 catties of rice. Except for a very few cases that were discovered and dealt with in a timely manner, the others were not discovered and given appropriate treatment in a timely manner. 2. Escort personnel are irresponsible and no one cares about the loss of grain: When delivering grain from Beixiaonanzhuang to Shandixi, a lot of rice was scattered along the way. One time, just sweeping it up slightly filled two sacks. The masses reflected, "It's easy to find the grain station, just follow the scattered grain." The severity of the situation can be imagined. The cadres and militiamen escorting trains only cared about sleeping, and a lot of grain was also lost: when transferring grain from Fenyang and Dongzhao to Mingli and Wusu, 47 sacks of grain were lost, each sack weighing 183 catties. The Lingshi grain station lost more than 600 sacks (it is not known whether there was any grain in them). 3. No concern for grain and no inspection of quality: 70,000 catties of flour and 150,000 catties of rice were stored in the courtyard in Wusu. When it rained, no one took care of it in time, causing it to get wet. Once, more than 1,000 sacks of grain were transferred from Qi County, the rice was bad, and 59 sacks of corn were soaked in water. Even worse, some sacks were mixed with soil and bricks. A portion of the grain transferred from Fenyang was half grain and half rice. Most of the white flour transferred from Taigu was mixed with corn flour and bean flour. 4. Grain and forage losses are too severe: Some counties did not weigh the firewood and forage they transferred, but only estimated the development list, and casually converted the dry and wet ratios, giving individual lawless elements opportunities to steal and embezzle. Pingyao once sent 500,000 catties of firewood, but only received 390,000 catties; once sent 80,000 catties of grass, but only received 33,000 catties.

The average weight loss for grain transferred from outside the area is 2.5%; the weight loss for grain transferred from within the area is 1.5%; after passing through the hands of the supply troops three times, the total weight loss is estimated to be 5.5% or 6% (including theft and embezzlement), according to the supply situation in × month, the grain loss is × 10,000 shi. In addition to the above problems, there are countless other smaller problems. The main reasons are: the leadership has serious ideas of quick victory, appeasement, and serious bureaucratic work styles: being busy with affairs, they did not conduct timely and in-depth inspections of the work. Now, in addition to continuing to inspect the leadership work, the supply office has sent Liu Gengming, Zhang Yougui, and others who are more serious, to the Jinzhong Administrative Office for legal action, and has instructed the special county command and its subordinate warehouses to conduct work inspections, continue to thoroughly investigate existing problems, and give treatment and education according to the severity of the problems. Appropriately adjust cadres, stipulate various methods for receiving, dispatching grain, firewood, and forage, and strictly manage grain and forage.

　　太原战役后方供应处
  　严格批判官僚主义  加强粮食草料管理
    【晋中电】为保障前方供给，严格整理粮柴草料，太原战役后方指挥部供应处，检查供应工作、发现在支援前线中，各管理站虽做出很大成绩，但还存在许多严重问题亟需改进：一、偷盗贪污未及时发现处理。第一办事处粮站会计张有贵，贪污米票五百斤，兑米出卖。第三办事处运输队刘更明任雪青，偷粮四次共计小米七百四十斤，白面九斤；廉价出售，挥霍浪费。祁县押车干部张子俭，使民工偷粮卅余斤换烧饼吃。交水押车民兵任长仁，偷米八十余斤被查获。平遥民工梁天宝，偷米一百余斤被抓获。以上除极少数及时发现处理外，其他均未及时发现给以适当处理。二、押车人员不负责丢粮没人管：北小南庄向山底送粮，沿路撒米很多，一次略扫一下即扫两口袋，群众反映说：“粮站好找，跟上撒的粮食走就是。”其严重程度可知。押火车干部民兵只管睡觉，也丢粮很多：从汾阳和东赵调鸣李·武宿粮时，丢粮四十七口袋，一袋百八十三斤。灵石粮站丢口袋六百余条（内有无粮食还不知道）。三、对粮不关心，质量不检查：武宿存面七万斤、米十五万斤，放在院里，天上下雨没及时管，致被雨淋湿。有一次从祁县调来粮食一千余袋，米是坏的、玉茭五十九袋上了水，更有袋内掺土和砖块的。汾阳调来的一部粮食，半谷半米。太谷调来白面大部掺上玉茭面和豆面。四、粮草脱耗太严重：有些县调来柴草不过秤，只估计开发单，干湿比例随便折合。给与个别不法分子以偷盗贪污的机会。平遥一次送柴五十万斤，只收三十九万斤；一次送草八万斤，只收到三万三千斤。
    外区调粮脱秤平均百分之二·五斤；本区调粮脱秤百分之一·五斤；到供给部队过三次手，总脱秤约计百分之五·五或六斤（内中连偷盗贪污在内），根据×月供给情形粮食损失×万石。除以上问题外，其他较小问题不胜枚举。其主要原因是：领导上存在着严重的速胜思想、迁就思想和严重的官僚主义作风：忙于事务，没有及时的深入检查工作。现在供应处除继续进行检查领导工作外，已将刘更明、张有贵等较严重的，送晋中行署法办，并已指示专县指挥部及所属各仓库进行工作检查，把现存问题继续深追，分别轻重给以处理和教育。适当调整干部，规定各种收发粮柴草及押车办法，严格粮草管理。
