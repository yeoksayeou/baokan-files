Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th -- TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: With the assistance of the Lee Seung-man puppet government, American monopoly capitalists have seized all of South Korea's economy and have turned South Korea into a US colony. The US occupation authorities have controlled 30% of all enterprises in South Korea, more than half of the consumer goods industry, half of all industrial equipment, and all of the electrical industry and non-ferrous metal mining industry. The actions of the US occupation authorities in South Korea have caused the disintegration of industry. For example, the total industrial output of Incheon City in October 1948 fell by 60% compared to April of the same year. The unemployed army in South Korea has grown to over three million people. Prices have soared 712 times, while wages have only increased 200 times. The gap between prices and wages continues to widen.

　　南鲜已成美殖民地全部资源被美攫夺
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社平壤讯：美国独占资本家在李承晚傀儡政府协助下，已攫取南朝鲜的全部经济，并已把南朝鲜变为美国的殖民地。美国占领当局已控制南朝鲜全部企业的百分之三十，消费品工业的一半以上，全部工业设备的半数，以及电气业及非铁金属采矿业的全部。美国占领当局在南朝鲜的行动已造成了工业的解体。例如仁川城一九四八年十月的工业总产量比同年四月下跌百分之六十。南朝鲜的失业军已增长至超过三百万人。物价已猛涨了七百一十二倍，而工资仅增二百倍。物价工资间的悬殊仍在继续扩大中。
