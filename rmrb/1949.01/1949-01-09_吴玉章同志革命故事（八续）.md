　　Comrade Wu Yuzhang's Revolutionary Stories (Eighth Installment)
    He Qifang
  　Engaged in International Propaganda Work After the War of Resistance
    After the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, Comrade Wu Yuzhang was sent from Moscow to Paris to engage in international propaganda work. He arrived in Paris on November 14th. Li Shizeng immediately arranged to go to Brussels, Belgium. Because at that time, countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty were holding an international conference in Brussels to discuss the issue of Japan's invasion of China. Comrade Wu Yuzhang met with the Chinese envoys to Europe attending the conference and strongly advocated that the countries at the conference should sanction Japan and aid China's war of resistance. Many of the members of the Chinese delegation were old acquaintances of Comrade Wu Yuzhang, such as Hu Shize and Qian Tai, who were his former classmates in Paris. That evening, Hu Shize invited him to his room to talk, saying that the news was not good, and that there was a strong argument within China for negotiating peace with Japan. At this time, the German ambassador,陶德曼 (Trautmann), had proposed peace terms in Nanjing, and the Chinese government had a tendency to compromise. Comrade Wu Yuzhang did not believe it at first, saying that China must resist until the end no matter what. Hu Shize, based on their old friendship, revealed more definite news. He said that he was afraid it could not be reversed and that those who advocated war in the past were now advocating peace. Comrade Wu Yuzhang repeatedly asked him who it was, and he said it was 孔祥熙 (Kong Xiangxi). After hearing this, Wu Yuzhang immediately told Gu Weijun and others in the delegation that the War of Resistance had just united the national strength, inspired the people, and raised China's international status. If peace were negotiated at this time, China would not be able to avoid destruction. He asked them to jointly send a telegram back to Nanjing, saying that they must not make peace under any circumstances. He also asked Li Shizeng to send a telegram to Chiang, hoping that he would resist to the end. Later, after receiving the news that Chiang had issued a statement that he was unwilling to negotiate peace, Comrade Wu Yuzhang felt relieved. The Chinese delegation was then able to speak more forcefully at the international conference.

    After arriving in Paris, Comrade Wu Yuzhang discussed international propaganda work with Gu Weijun. He said that Yang Guang＠ was responsible for this matter and asked Comrade Wu Yuzhang to contact him. However, after talking with Yang several times, Comrade Wu Yuzhang always felt that their opinions were not in agreement. Yang's method was to promote propaganda to the upper classes and government offices in France. He spent more than 100,000 francs to print a propaganda booklet with ancient relics such as the Temple of Heaven and the Qianmen Gate in Beijing and pictures of some responsible Chinese figures, but it did not show the heroic resistance and united spirit of the Chinese people. After printing, he wanted the "Paris Times" to distribute it to its subscribers, most of whom were upper-class French people who had no interest in China's war of resistance. Therefore, his propaganda had no effect. Comrade Wu Yuzhang thought differently, he wanted to promote propaganda to the broad masses of French people who sympathized with China's war of resistance, especially the working class. Therefore, when Japanese people who wanted to buy military supplies visited a French aircraft factory, the workers went on strike to protest, which made these Japanese people embarrassed and leave. Also, the dockworkers of British and French ships refused to transport military supplies for the Japanese.

    On December 11, 1937, Paul Langevin, the chairman of the French Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Committee, convened a press conference for Comrade Wu Yuzhang, where Comrade Wu Yuzhang reported on the situation of China's War of Resistance and the conditions for China's victory (the full text can be found in the "Selected Anti-War Speeches of Wu Yuzhang"). Forty to fifty reporters attended the meeting and expressed their support enthusiastically and were willing to help China's War of Resistance. But strangely, some bad elements of the Kuomintang deliberately raised many strange questions, saying that Shanghai and Nanjing had fallen, and that China had no navy, insufficient weapons, and so on. Their intention was to refute Comrade Wu Yuzhang, saying that there was no possibility of victory in the War of Resistance. However, Comrade Wu Yuzhang powerfully answered them, saying that war mainly depends not on weapons but on the people. These bad elements who were spreading propaganda for the Japanese invaders were speechless.

    In February 1938, Comrade Wu Yuzhang attended the World Anti-Aggression Congress in London. He and Mr. Tao Xingzhi went to pay tribute to Marx's tomb together. They searched for a long time in a large public cemetery, and finally found it from a few words written by Engels on the tombstone. It was originally no different from ordinary tombs, lying plainly in this vast cemetery. Facing the tomb of this giant, Comrade Wu Yuzhang sighed and thought of how some people in China wanted to build a royal mausoleum to bury Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which may not have been what a people's revolutionary would have hoped for.

    In March, Comrade Wu Yuzhang set off to return to China. He arrived in Saigon in early April, and many overseas Chinese came to invite Comrade Wu Yuzhang to give speeches along the way. Because the "National Salvation Times" that he ran had a great influence among overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese in these places were very enthusiastic about the War of Resistance. He arrived in Wuhan at the end of April, and immediately participated in the united front work of our party in China at that time, and also became a member of the National Political Council. In November 1939, he returned to Yan'an from Chongqing.

    The Rectification Movement
    In April 1942, the Yan'an Rectification Movement began.
    Comrade Wu Yuzhang was very enthusiastic about the Rectification Movement from the very beginning. He said that he initially thought he had learned some Marxism-Leninism, and that his understanding in the books was not bad, but the more he studied Chairman Mao's works and reports, the more he felt that he had not done a good job himself. He read them carefully and felt that some of the words were like criticisms of himself. For example, when Chairman Mao criticized dogmatism, he felt a bit scared. He said that at first he was a little uncomfortable, but after thinking carefully, the discomfort meant that he had this problem himself, and it had hit him where it hurt. Since he had discovered his own shortcomings, why should he cover them up? Wouldn't it be good to use the methods pointed out by Chairman Mao of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient, to cure himself? Thinking this way, he didn't feel uncomfortable at all, but instead became happy. So he seriously reviewed and criticized himself. He met with comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to review each other, criticizing himself and asking others to criticize him. At first, he felt a little sad when he heard others' criticisms, but after thinking it through, he liked people criticizing him. He felt that after the rectification, he had a deeper understanding of Marxism-Leninism and dialectics. He understood that Marxism-Leninism is not a dogma but a guide to action, and that truly understanding Marxism-Leninism meant combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, rather than mechanically applying the texts of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao established this method of transforming thinking, so that every party member could have a correct worldview and outlook on life, which is why our party has such great strength today.

    He said that the mutual criticism and self-criticism among the comrades of the Central Committee were very enthusiastic. One comrade who had made line errors in the past, because the errors were very serious, went through several months of pain, and finally figured it out. At the Seventh National Congress, this comrade reported on the mistakes he had made in the past, speaking with tears, and everyone was very moved. Because of his recognition and correction of his mistakes, the conference still elected him as a member of the Central Committee. After the rectification, the ideology within the party was unified, the comrades were very harmonious and vigorous, so the Seventh National Congress was very successful, it was a congress of unity and a congress of victory.

    The above story consists of twenty installments, compiled to celebrate Comrade Wu Yuzhang's 70th birthday. Due to limited knowledge and the hasty writing, it is inevitable that it is simple and crude. Further supplementation and polishing to make it more readable will have to wait for another day. Having finished writing, it is already the time when the rooster crows incessantly. The dawn of the New China is also approaching. Those who rise up upon hearing the news are increasing day by day. I add a few words to express my feelings and encouragement.

　　吴玉章同志革命故事（八续）
    何其芳
  　抗战后作国际宣传工作
    七七抗战爆发，吴玉章同志被由莫斯科派到巴黎作国际宣传工作。十一月十四日到巴黎，李石曾一见面就相约到比京布鲁塞尔。因为这时签字于九国公约的各国正在布鲁塞尔开国际会议，讨论日本侵略中国问题。吴玉章同志会见出席该会的中国驻欧各使节，力主在会议上要各国制裁日本，援助中国抗战。当时中国代表团中颇多吴玉章同志旧日熟人，如胡世泽、钱泰就是他从前在巴黎的同学。当晚，胡世泽约他到房里去谈，说消息不好，国内要和日本议和的说法很厉害。这时正是德国大使陶德曼在南京提出和平条件，中国政府有妥协趋势。吴玉章同志还不相信，说中国无论如何要抗战到底。胡世泽以旧日同学关系，更说出了确实消息。他说恐怕不能挽回了，以前主战的人现在也主和了。吴玉章同志再三问他是谁，他说是孔祥熙。吴玉章听说后，马上对代表团顾维钧等说抗战刚才团结了全国力量，振奋了全国人心，提高了国际地位，如果此时言和，中国将不能免于灭亡。要他们联名打电报回南京，无论如何不能和。又要李石曾也打电报给蒋，希望他抗战到底。后来得到蒋发表不愿和谈消息，吴玉章同志才放心了。中国代表团在国际会议上说话也才有力了。
    到巴黎后，吴玉章同志和顾维钧商谈国际宣传工作，他说这事由杨光＠负责，要吴玉章同志和他接洽。但吴玉章同志和杨谈了好几回，总觉彼此意见不合。杨的办法是向法国上层人士和官厅作宣传。他花十多万法郎印了一本宣传册子，上面印了北平天坛前门之类的古迹和一些中国负责人物的像片，并未把中国人民的英勇抗战事实、和团结一致的精神表现出来。印好后，他又要巴黎时报附送给它的订户，而这些订户也多是法国上层人物，他们根本对中国抗日无兴趣。因此他的宣传没有什么效果。吴玉章同志不然，他是向法国同情中国抗日的广大人民作宣传，尤其是工人群众。因此后来有日本买军火的人到法国飞机厂参观，厂里工人就罢工来抗议，使这些日本人狼狈而去。还有英法轮船码头工人也不肯为日人运军火。
    一九三七年十二月十一日，法国反战反法西斯委员会的会长郎之万特为吴玉章同志召集了一次新闻记者招待会，由吴玉章同志报告中国抗战情形和中国能够胜利的条件（全文见“吴玉章抗战言论选集”），到会记者四五十人，大家很热烈地表示赞同，并愿意援助中国抗战。但很可怪的，有几个国民党的坏分子却反而故意提出许多怪问题，说上海南京都已失守，中国没有海军，武器不够，等等，怎么办。他们的意思是想反驳吴玉章同志，说抗战没有胜利的可能。吴玉章同志却有力地回答了他们，说战争主要的不是靠武器而是靠人民。这些替日寇宣传的坏分子也就哑口无言了。
    一九三八年二月，吴玉章同志出席伦敦世界反侵略大会。他曾与陶行知先生一同去瞻拜马克思墓。在一个很大的公共坟场中找了许久，后来从墓碑上恩格斯题的几句话才找到了，它原来和普通坟墓没有什么不同，一样朴素地躺在这广漠的坟场上。对着这个巨人的坟墓，吴玉章同志很慨叹地想起了中国某些人却要修一座皇陵一样的陵来埋葬孙中山先生，这也许并非一个人民的革命家所希望的吧。
    三月，吴玉章同志动身回国。四月初到西贡，沿途很多华侨来请吴玉章同志讲演。因为他办的“救国时报”在华侨中有很大影响，所以这些地方的华侨对抗日战争非常热烈。四月底到武汉，即参加了当时我党的国内统一战线工作，并作了国民参政会的参政员。一九三九年十一月，由重庆回到延安。
    整风运动
    一九四二年四月，延安整风运动开始。
    吴玉章同志对于整风运动一开始就很热心。他说，他最初自家以为还学了一些马列主义，书本上的了解还不错，但越研究毛主席的著作和报告才越感到自家并未搞好。他细细地读，感到有些话就象批评自己一样，如毛主席批评教条主义那些地方，他就有些感到毛骨竦然。他说，起初也有点不痛快，后来细细一想，不痛快正是自己有这个毛病，刺到了痛处，既然发现了自己的毛病，何必护短呢？就用毛主席指出的惩前毖后，治病救人的方法来医治自己，岂不很好吗？这样一想，就没有什么不痛快，反而高兴起来了。于是他就认真来检讨、批评自己。他和中共中央的同志们开会来互相检讨，自己批评、请别人批评。起初听到别人的批评也有些难过，后来想通了，就喜欢人家批评了。他觉得在整风以后，才深入地了解了马列主义，了解了辩证法。了解了马列主义不是教条而是行动的指南，必须以马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命的实践相结合，而不是机械的运用马列主义书本上的条文，才是真正地懂得了马列主义。毛主席确立了这个改造思想的方法，使每个党员都能有正确的宇宙观和人生观，因此我党才有今天这样伟大的力量。
    他说中央同志们的互相批评，自我批评，都是很热烈的。有一位过去犯过路线错误的同志，因为错误很沉重，经过了几个月的苦痛，终于还是想通了。在七大开会时，这位同志报告他过去犯的错误，讲得痛哭流涕，大家也都很感动。由于他的认识错误与改正错误，大会仍然选他为中央委员。整风以后党内的思想统一了，同志间十分和谐生气勃勃，所以七大开得很好，是一个团结的大会，胜利的大会。
    以上故事共二十则，为庆祝吴玉章同志七十大寿而整理。由于所知有限，又系匆促写出，遂难免简陋潦草。补充润色，使之较为可读，则尚有待于他日。执笔既竟，已至鸡鸣不已之时。新中国之光明亦已迫近。闻风兴起者与日俱增乎。为赘数语，以志感奋。
