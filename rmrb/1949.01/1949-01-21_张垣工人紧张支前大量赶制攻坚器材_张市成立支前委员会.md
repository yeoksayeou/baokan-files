　　[Zhangjiakou Electric] In order to fully and actively support the front lines, liberate Beiping, and liberate all of North China, the Zhangjiakou City Support the Front Committee was established on the 14th of this month. Mayor Zhang Mengxu was publicly elected as the director, and Wei YiWang and Jiang Shizhi as deputy directors. Under the leadership of this committee, railway and lumber factory workers in Zhangjiakou are working with redoubled enthusiasm and a tense work ethic, actively rushing to produce siege equipment. When the railway factory workers accepted the task of making hundreds of rock-drilling picks, all the workers in the drilling group, except for a few who were making locomotive springs, participated in this work. In order to complete this glorious task, the workers worked an extra four hours on the night of the 15th and did not rest on Sunday the 16th. The workers handling the large materials were very tired, so the workers took turns using the tongs, each sweating profusely. The pickaxes for drilling rock had to have four through-holes drilled in the handle and head, which would take 25 minutes per pickaxe using an electric drill. Even with the two electric drills in the machine group, it would be difficult to complete in five days. Because it was urgently needed, Yang Huating, a worker-turned-engineer, repeatedly researched and came up with a new method: only drill a little more than one inch deep into the handle tube, and weld the handle tube and pickaxe head securely together. Thus, the new method was used for all the pickaxes, and the drilling work for each pickaxe only took six minutes, thus saving two-thirds of the labor. The machine, tool, and assembly groups began repairing guns and cannons on the third day of Zhangjiakou's liberation. In the past 20 days, they have repaired many mortars, machine guns, rifles, and anti-tank guns. When fitting the breechblocks for the anti-tank guns, because none of the workers had done it before, Yang Yushan and other eight workers carefully studied the problem together, overcame the difficulties of unsuitable machinery, and completed the fitting and delivery of the breechblocks seven days ago. The Zhongxing Cooperative Lumber Factory and the Enterprise Company Lumber Factory, with more than 200 workers and three electric saws, worked overnight to produce one mother-and-son ladder. A 10-horsepower electric saw sawed 77 pieces of lumber, each 7 meters long and weighing more than 500 kilograms, in seven hours. The Zhongxing Cooperative Lumber Factory originally planned for the electric saw to saw 7.3 meters of lumber per hour, with each piece requiring seven saw cuts, which would allow five pieces to be sawed. Due to the workers' enthusiastic and tense work, on the 14th, an average of six pieces were sawed per hour. On the 15th, because the transformer for the electric saw was repaired, work was delayed until 13:00. By 22:00, there were still nearly 30 wooden poles that had not been sawed, so the workers proposed the slogan: "No sleeping until the work is done!" Tang Renyi of the factory said: "I heard that Beiping is being attacked, and the workers are very happy. In order to avenge Fu Zuoyi's conscription of soldiers, the workers must work like this." The carpenters in the first and seventh districts also actively participated in this work. Twenty-four carpenters worked continuously until 3:00 on the 14th before resting.

　　张垣工人紧张支前大量赶制攻坚器材
  　张市成立支前委员会
    【张垣电】为了以全力积极支援前线，解放北平，解放全华北，张市支援前线委员会已于本月十四日成立。公推市长张孟旭为主任，魏议望、江石之为副主任，在该会领导下，张市铁路、木厂工人以百倍热情紧张的工作精神，积极赶制攻坚器材。铁路工厂工人当接受了打×百个摇山洞镐的任务时，打洞组工人除几个打机车戮簧的以外，全部参加了这一工作。为着完成这一光荣的任务，工人们已于十五日夜加工四小时，十六日星期日也没休息。打大料时掌钳工人很累，工人就轮流掌钳，个个累得满脸流汗。摇山洞镐的镐柄与镐头须钻四个透眼，用电钻口眼每个镐即需二十五分钟，连同机器组的两个电钻在内，五天时间也难完成，因为需用急迫，经工人出身的工务员杨华亭翻复研究，想出只钻柄筒一分多深，把柄筒和镐头焊牢靠即可，于是全部使用新法，每个镐的钻眼工作只需六分钟，因而省工三分之二。机器、工具、装配各组，在张市解放的第三天即开始修配枪炮，二十天来已修配了许多迫击炮、机枪、步枪、战防炮。在配战防炮的炮闩时，因为工人谁也没有做过，杨玉相等八个工人遂集体细心研究，克服了机器不适用的困难，并已于七日前配好出厂。中兴合木厂、企业公司制材厂，二百余工人、三部电锯，连夜赶制子母梯一部，十马力的电锯七小时就锯出长七米、重五百余斤的木料七十七根。中兴和木厂原计划电动锯每小时锯七米三长的木材，每根以七锯计，可锯五根，由于工人热情紧张工作的结果，十四号一天每小时平均锯了六根。十五号因为修理电锯变压器，耽误到十三点才开工，到二十二点还有近三十根木杆未锯，工人就提出了口号：“干不完不睡觉。”该厂唐任一说：“听说打北平，工人们可痛快啦，为了报报傅作义抓兵的仇气，工人们也得这样干。”一、七区木工也积极参加了这一工作。二十四个木工工人在十四号一直工作到三点钟才休息。
