[Beiyue News] On December 25th, the Education Section of Jingxing County convened a county-wide education conference. Attendees included education assistants from each district, principals of normal schools and complete primary schools, central teachers from each district, as well as the propaganda minister of the CCP County Committee and propaganda representatives from each district committee. The conference lasted three and a half days, reviewing the work of the two months since the autumn vacation school opening. First, the achievements were clarified: most schools in the county have been restored and rectified, and the proportion of children formally enrolled in school in districts six, seven, eight, and nine reached 50% to 60% of school-age children; districts one, two, three, four, and five reached 30% to 40%. District one previously had the worst education work, with a total of thirty-two elementary schools, almost all of which collapsed last autumn; now twenty-six have been restored. After the autumn vacation school opening in District eight, there were generally no students for a long time. Now, except for Huangdu and two other villages, the number of enrolled children is more than half of the school-age children. In Sanhekou it reaches three-quarters. In Yanfeng, the number suddenly increased from a little over a hundred to two hundred and twenty. In Jia Village Fourth Complete Primary School, the senior section had only twenty-one students in October, but now it has increased to fifty-two; the junior section has increased from fifty to one hundred and twenty-five. In Weishui Eighth Complete Primary School, the senior section has developed from twelve to seventy-five, and the junior section has developed from fifty to one hundred and forty. Most schools have renovated school buildings, purchased textbooks, reorganized grades, and adhered to systems such as class attendance and leave, gradually getting on the right track. In Shang'an West Village in District eight, there are now one hundred and ninety students who regularly attend school; the three teachers have five classes a day and are working very hard. Parents reflect that "the schools are looking good now," and they automatically take money to buy textbooks for their children.
    
    Jingxing's experience in rectifying primary schools:
    The reasons for achieving the above results: First, vigorously promoting and truly implementing the policy of primary school regularization. For example, the teachers of Weishui Eighth Complete Primary School divided the work, some going to the countryside to promote mobilization, and some sticking to teaching at home, teaching one when one came, teaching two when two came, and the number of students gradually increased; various systems were improved and adhered to, the cultural level of students was significantly improved, and parents personally sent their children to school. The classrooms were full, and they wouldn't go back even if they were crowded. Comrade Xu Dunshu, a teacher in the senior section of the school, said confidently: "When this class of students graduates in two years, I guarantee that I can teach them to the cultural level of primary school graduates before the War of Resistance." Second, strengthening district-level leadership is also a key to running schools well. For example, the district chief of District eight took the initiative to approach and help teachers, held teacher study meetings, and promptly understood and resolved the disunity of the two teachers in Touquan Village and other issues. The district chief of District one combined the autumn requisition with the rectification of primary schools, speaking about the importance of running schools at mass meetings, and specifically helping teachers and Du Gan to initially rectify the elementary schools that had already collapsed. In this way, the education work in districts six and eight was relatively good. Conversely, districts three and five have consistently neglected school education, and the schools in these two districts are doing poorly. Third, the subjective efforts of teachers to overcome difficulties are the decisive condition for running schools well. For example, the two principals of Fourth Complete Primary School and Eighth Complete Primary School put in hard work and brains, and strived for initiative in their work, overcoming numerous difficulties and creating valuable new experiences in mobilizing, managing children, and leading teachers. Both the junior and senior sections of these two schools are making rapid progress. Du Xuancheng in District seven and Gao Fengchun in District two, etc., found their own ways to solve the difficulties of textbooks and slates for children, achieving regular classes. Le Xiang, a teacher at Fifth Complete Primary School, worked hard to study and created and accumulated a lot of valuable teaching experience. Conversely, some teachers only complained about difficulties, only complained about small classrooms, few desks, village cadres not caring, and superiors not taking the lead, not settling down to work, and not being able to actively overcome difficulties, resulting in fewer and fewer schools. Fourth, cooperate with social education, strengthen ties with village cadres, the masses, and parents, and give full play to the power of the masses. The principal of Sixth Complete Primary School said: "At the beginning, I didn't pay attention to contacting all parties, and I ran education behind closed doors. The junior section had only thirty children, and most of them could not be mobilized to school. Later, with the help of village cadres and the masses, one hundred and forty children entered the school." In the Liangguo area of District eight, a children's parent committee was organized, and the number of students generally increased. Fifth, if the principals of complete primary schools and central teachers can lead general teachers well, it will have a great effect. For example, the school district meeting led by Zhang Chenkui, the central teacher of District six, after launching criticism and self-criticism, the teachers in the school district who were not working hard began to improve. The central school district meeting in Yujia Village in District nine became a study meeting, and teachers were highly interested and made rapid progress. Matai Village in District seven adopted the method of creating experience in the central village to promote the general, which was quite effective. The principal of Eighth Complete Primary School can grasp the thoughts and requirements of each teacher and conduct different leadership and assistance, everyone is very satisfied, and progress is also great. They can do their work competently and happily. Sixth, the Jingxing Education Association has been of great help to the Education Section and teachers since it was reorganized from the wheat vacation training class. It has held one test, stimulating and improving the teachers' learning enthusiasm, and timely collecting feedback from below, providing the leadership with information about the situation below. LÃ¼ Xuechun, a member of the executive committee of District one, led the teachers to restore and rectify the schools in District one, achieving remarkable results.

    There are still many shortcomings that need to be overcome quickly
    On the other hand, many shortcomings were also identified: First, the leadership is not sound, the Education Section has few cadres, little strength, and cannot afford the heavy burden of the county's education work. The ten-day district meeting has not been communicated for a long time. District-level leadership has not been strengthened in most districts. For example, Xuan Du Li E of District five reviewed: "Our district's leadership over schools is neglected, and teachers take the initiative to find the district, but they still don't care. Once, before a village cadre meeting, they allowed teachers to be notified to participate and study education work by the way, but they forgot when the time came." District seven also reviewed that teachers are used a lot, but specific help is little. Second, there are still some village cadres who do not care about schools, but misuse teachers. For example, Wang Han, a teacher in Wangjia Village in District nine, held meetings, collected people, and cooked meals for village cadres during the expansion of the army, abandoning teaching. Some villages have turned schools into village offices and grain stations, with people and horses noisy all day long, affecting classes. Third, and more importantly, there are still some teachers who are passively slacking off and have serious indiscipline. For example, He Xueqian, the principal of a complete primary school, refused to obey the transfer (from one school to another), and Guo Chun, a teacher in Xia'an, ran around Shimen and Xia Huolu. Liu Yanhe and Bai Zhenglun, teachers in District nine, etc., left their posts without permission to go to the market and go home.

    After the above shortcomings were exposed, specific solutions were studied separately, and the leadership at all levels should be improved and strengthened, and teachers should be rewarded and punished strictly. Then, specific arrangements and discussions were made on the work of primary school regularization, winter school movement, teacher learning, and publicity and communication. Finally, each district formulated its own work plan for the next stage, and six district committee propaganda challenged each other saying: "Guarantee to help teachers solve difficulties and lead the education work in this district well." The teacher comrades felt stronger and confidently proposed to run the schools well; and formulated conditions, districts and districts launched competition, and decided to summarize and commend at the annual vacation training class.
