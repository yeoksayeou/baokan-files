[Beiyue News] On December 25th, the Education Section of Jingxing County convened a county-wide education conference. Attendees included education assistants from each district, principals of normal schools and complete primary schools, central teachers from each district, as well as the propaganda minister of the CCP County Committee and propaganda representatives from each district committee. The conference lasted three and a half days, reviewing the work of the two months since the autumn vacation school opening. First, the achievements were clarified: most schools in the county have been restored and rectified, and the proportion of children formally enrolled in school in districts six, seven, eight, and nine reached 50% to 60% of school-age children; districts one, two, three, four, and five reached 30% to 40%. District one previously had the worst education work, with a total of thirty-two elementary schools, almost all of which collapsed last autumn; now twenty-six have been restored. After the autumn vacation school opening in District eight, there were generally no students for a long time. Now, except for Huangdu and two other villages, the number of enrolled children is more than half of the school-age children. In Sanhekou it reaches three-quarters. In Yanfeng, the number suddenly increased from a little over a hundred to two hundred and twenty. In Jia Village Fourth Complete Primary School, the senior section had only twenty-one students in October, but now it has increased to fifty-two; the junior section has increased from fifty to one hundred and twenty-five. In Weishui Eighth Complete Primary School, the senior section has developed from twelve to seventy-five, and the junior section has developed from fifty to one hundred and forty. Most schools have renovated school buildings, purchased textbooks, reorganized grades, and adhered to systems such as class attendance and leave, gradually getting on the right track. In Shang'an West Village in District eight, there are now one hundred and ninety students who regularly attend school; the three teachers have five classes a day and are working very hard. Parents reflect that "the schools are looking good now," and they automatically take money to buy textbooks for their children.
    
    Jingxing's experience in rectifying primary schools:
    The reasons for achieving the above results: First, vigorously promoting and truly implementing the policy of primary school regularization. For example, the teachers of Weishui Eighth Complete Primary School divided the work, some going to the countryside to promote mobilization, and some sticking to teaching at home, teaching one when one came, teaching two when two came, and the number of students gradually increased; various systems were improved and adhered to, the cultural level of students was significantly improved, and parents personally sent their children to school. The classrooms were full, and they wouldn't go back even if they were crowded. Comrade Xu Dunshu, a teacher in the senior section of the school, said confidently: "When this class of students graduates in two years, I guarantee that I can teach them to the cultural level of primary school graduates before the War of Resistance." Second, strengthening district-level leadership is also a key to running schools well. For example, the district chief of District eight took the initiative to approach and help teachers, held teacher study meetings, and promptly understood and resolved the disunity of the two teachers in Touquan Village and other issues. The district chief of District one combined the autumn requisition with the rectification of primary schools, speaking about the importance of running schools at mass meetings, and specifically helping teachers and Du Gan to initially rectify the elementary schools that had already collapsed. In this way, the education work in districts six and eight was relatively good. Conversely, districts three and five have consistently neglected school education, and the schools in these two districts are doing poorly. Third, the subjective efforts of teachers to overcome difficulties are the decisive condition for running schools well. For example, the two principals of Fourth Complete Primary School and Eighth Complete Primary School put in hard work and brains, and strived for initiative in their work, overcoming numerous difficulties and creating valuable new experiences in mobilizing, managing children, and leading teachers. Both the junior and senior sections of these two schools are making rapid progress. Du Xuancheng in District seven and Gao Fengchun in District two, etc., found their own ways to solve the difficulties of textbooks and slates for children, achieving regular classes. Le Xiang, a teacher at Fifth Complete Primary School, worked hard to study and created and accumulated a lot of valuable teaching experience. Conversely, some teachers only complained about difficulties, only complained about small classrooms, few desks, village cadres not caring, and superiors not taking the lead, not settling down to work, and not being able to actively overcome difficulties, resulting in fewer and fewer schools. Fourth, cooperate with social education, strengthen ties with village cadres, the masses, and parents, and give full play to the power of the masses. The principal of Sixth Complete Primary School said: "At the beginning, I didn't pay attention to contacting all parties, and I ran education behind closed doors. The junior section had only thirty children, and most of them could not be mobilized to school. Later, with the help of village cadres and the masses, one hundred and forty children entered the school." In the Liangguo area of District eight, a children's parent committee was organized, and the number of students generally increased. Fifth, if the principals of complete primary schools and central teachers can lead general teachers well, it will have a great effect. For example, the school district meeting led by Zhang Chenkui, the central teacher of District six, after launching criticism and self-criticism, the teachers in the school district who were not working hard began to improve. The central school district meeting in Yujia Village in District nine became a study meeting, and teachers were highly interested and made rapid progress. Matai Village in District seven adopted the method of creating experience in the central village to promote the general, which was quite effective. The principal of Eighth Complete Primary School can grasp the thoughts and requirements of each teacher and conduct different leadership and assistance, everyone is very satisfied, and progress is also great. They can do their work competently and happily. Sixth, the Jingxing Education Association has been of great help to the Education Section and teachers since it was reorganized from the wheat vacation training class. It has held one test, stimulating and improving the teachers' learning enthusiasm, and timely collecting feedback from below, providing the leadership with information about the situation below. Lü Xuechun, a member of the executive committee of District one, led the teachers to restore and rectify the schools in District one, achieving remarkable results.

    There are still many shortcomings that need to be overcome quickly
    On the other hand, many shortcomings were also identified: First, the leadership is not sound, the Education Section has few cadres, little strength, and cannot afford the heavy burden of the county's education work. The ten-day district meeting has not been communicated for a long time. District-level leadership has not been strengthened in most districts. For example, Xuan Du Li E of District five reviewed: "Our district's leadership over schools is neglected, and teachers take the initiative to find the district, but they still don't care. Once, before a village cadre meeting, they allowed teachers to be notified to participate and study education work by the way, but they forgot when the time came." District seven also reviewed that teachers are used a lot, but specific help is little. Second, there are still some village cadres who do not care about schools, but misuse teachers. For example, Wang Han, a teacher in Wangjia Village in District nine, held meetings, collected people, and cooked meals for village cadres during the expansion of the army, abandoning teaching. Some villages have turned schools into village offices and grain stations, with people and horses noisy all day long, affecting classes. Third, and more importantly, there are still some teachers who are passively slacking off and have serious indiscipline. For example, He Xueqian, the principal of a complete primary school, refused to obey the transfer (from one school to another), and Guo Chun, a teacher in Xia'an, ran around Shimen and Xia Huolu. Liu Yanhe and Bai Zhenglun, teachers in District nine, etc., left their posts without permission to go to the market and go home.

    After the above shortcomings were exposed, specific solutions were studied separately, and the leadership at all levels should be improved and strengthened, and teachers should be rewarded and punished strictly. Then, specific arrangements and discussions were made on the work of primary school regularization, winter school movement, teacher learning, and publicity and communication. Finally, each district formulated its own work plan for the next stage, and six district committee propaganda challenged each other saying: "Guarantee to help teachers solve difficulties and lead the education work in this district well." The teacher comrades felt stronger and confidently proposed to run the schools well; and formulated conditions, districts and districts launched competition, and decided to summarize and commend at the annual vacation training class.

　　“现在的学堂象样啦！”
  　井陉小学教育经过整顿走上正轨
    【北岳讯】十二月廿五日，井陉县教育科召开全县教育会议，出席者为各区教育助理员、师范、完小校长、各中心教员，还有中共县委宣传部长和各区区委宣传参加。会议历时三天半，检查了秋假开校以来两个多月的工作。首先明确了成绩：全县绝大部分学校都已恢复和整顿，儿童正式入学的比例，六、七、八、九四个区达学龄儿童百分之五十至六十；一、二、三、四、五五个区达百分之三十至四十。一区以前教育工作最差，共三十二座初小，去秋以来几乎全部垮台，现已恢复二十六座。八区秋假开校后，好长时间普遍没学生，现在除皇都等二村外，入学儿童都在学龄儿童一半以上。三合口达四分之三，岩峰由百十来个突增到二百二十名，贾庄四完小十月份高级部只有二十一人，现增到五十二名，初级部由五十人增到一百二十五人，微水八完小高级部由十二人发展到七十五人，初级部由五十人发展到一百四十人。大部学校都经过整修校舍，购买课本，整编年级，坚持了上课告假等制度，逐步走上正规。八区上安西村现有一百九十名学生经常到校；三个教员，每天五节课抓的挺紧，家长反映说：“现在的学堂可象个样子了。”都自动拿钱给自己孩子买课本。
    井陉整顿小学的经验：
    获得以上成绩的原因：一、大力宣传与真正执行了小学正规化的方针。如微水八完小教员分工，有的下乡宣传动员，有的在家坚持教学，来一个教一个，来两个教两个，学生渐渐增多；健全与坚持了各种制度，学生文化水平显著提高，家长亲自送儿童入校。教室满了，挤着也不回去。该校高级部教员许敦书同志满有信心地说：“这班学生二年毕业时，我保证能教成抗战前高小毕业生的文化程度”。二、区级领导加强，也是学校办好的一个关键。如八区区长主动接近与帮助教员，召开教员学习会，及时了解与解决了头泉村两个教员的不团结等问题。一区区长在秋征中结合整顿小学，群众大会上讲办学校的重要，具体帮助教员与杜干，把已经垮了台的初小，初步整顿起来。这样，六、八区的教育工作就比较好。相反，三、五区一贯对学校教育忽视，该两区学校搞的就差一些。三、教员主观努力，克服困难，是办好学校的决定条件。如四完小、八完小两个校长，下辛苦费脑子，在工作上努力争取主动，克服了重重困难，创造了宝贵的动员、管理儿童与领导教员的新经验。该两校不论初高级部，都在突飞猛进。七区杜宣成、二区高逢春等自己设法，给儿童解决了书本和石板的困难，达到正规上课。五完小教员乐湘努力钻研，创造和积累了好多教学上的宝贵经验。相反，部分教员光喊困难，光怨教室小，桌子少，村干不管，上级不做主，不安心工作，不能主动克服困难，结果学校越弄越少。四、配合社会教育，加强和村干群众家长的联系，充分发挥群众力量。六完小校长谈：“开始没注意和各方面联系，关门办教育，初级部只三十个儿童，大部动员不到校；以后在村干群众的帮助下，一百四十个儿童进了学校。八区良郭一带组织了儿童家长委员会，学生普遍增加。五、完小校长与中心教员对一般教员，如能很好领导，作用很大。如六区中心教员张成魁领导的学区会，经展开批评与自我批评，该学区不努力的教员开始好转了。九区于家中心学区会，成了学习会，教员兴趣高，进步快。七区马台村采用在中心村创造经验，推动一般的方法，生效不小。八完校长能掌握各个教员的思想与要求，进行不同的领导和帮助，大家很满意，进步也很大。工作能胜任愉快。六、井陉教联会自从麦假训练班改组以来，对教育科和教员帮助都很大。举行过测验一次，刺激与提高了教员的学习情绪，并及时搜集下边反映，供给领导上了解下情。一区区执委吕学纯领导教员，恢复与整顿一区学校，取得显著成绩。
    还有不少缺点需要赶快克服
    另方面，也检查出还有不少缺点：一、领导上不健全，教育科干部少，力量小，负不起全县教育工作的重担。分区十日会议，很长时间没有传达下去。区级领导，大部区还没加强。如五区宣杜李蛾检讨：“俺区对学校的领导是忽视的，教员主动找区，还是不管。一次开村干会前，允许通知教员参加，顺便研究教育工作，结果到期又忘了。”七区也检讨出对教员使用多，具体帮助少。二、还有一部分村干部不管学校，反而乱使用教员。如九区王家教员王汉在扩军中替村干开会，收人、做饭，放弃了教学。还有一些村把学校做成村公所、屯粮站，整天人马嘈杂，影响上课。三、更重要的是还有一部分教员消极怠工，存在严重的无纪律现象。如完小校长何学谦不服从调动（从一个校调到另一个校），下安教员郭春走石门、下获鹿，乱跑一气。九区教员刘彦合、白正伦等赶集回家擅离职守。
    以上缺点经暴露之后，分别研究出具体克服办法，要健全与加强各级领导，对教员要赏罚严明。接着对小学正规化、冬学运动、教员学习、宣传通讯等工作，都作了具体布置和讨论。最后各区自订下一段工作计划，有六个区委宣传互相挑战说：“保证帮助教员解决困难，把本区教育工作领导好。”教员同志感觉腰硬了，都很有信心地提出要办好学校；并拟订条件，区与区展开竞赛，决定至年假训练班总结评功。
