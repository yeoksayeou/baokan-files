　　A Close-Up of the Flag-Giving Ceremony
　　Li Jialing
　　Groups of new soldiers surged into the meeting place like a tide, jumping and laughing. Each one was dressed so neatly and cleanly, unable to suppress the joy in their hearts like grooms, their faces beaming with happiness from within.
　　"Meeting's starting!" As soon as the assembly whistle blew, people who were scattered in piles and groups immediately sat upright in rows. Hundreds of pairs of intense eyes stared straight at the stage. They forgot the roaring north wind and the biting cold, their eyes wide with anticipation, waiting for the blessings of the farewell representatives...….
　　One by one, the representatives finished their speeches with extreme excitement and enthusiasm. Finally, it was time to read the letter from the Municipal Party Committee. When the female comrade finished reading with excitement and fluency: "We hope that you will quickly learn the skills to kill the enemy, go to the front lines to perform meritorious service, we look forward to your good news, and wish to see you triumphantly return at an early date." A stout, dark-skinned new soldier squatting in the corner suddenly jumped up and asked like he was ringing a bell, "Can we do it?" A burst of resounding voices answered, "We can do it!" Hundreds of fists were raised like iron hammers.
　　Old Wang, sweating profusely, brought the red flag. Everyone's eyes immediately turned to the stage. The flag-giving ceremony began. It was as if a gust of wind suddenly blew, shaking the branches. The soldiers' heads swayed from side to side, surveying the inscriptions on the red flag—"Revolutionary Pioneers," "Performing Meritorious Service for the People"...….The representatives solemnly and enthusiastically presented the flags to the soldiers. Red flags fluttered in the air, encouraging the soldiers' enthusiasm and igniting their hearts to kill the enemy.
　　Wang Xiaoniu and Zhang Xintai competed to take the red flag. Guo Yinbao complained that Li Fuquan was holding the flag too low. The soldiers in the back shouted, "Raise it higher, we can't see it." Xiao Zhang rushed out from the crowd, raised a red flag, and read out, "Perform Meritorious Service on the Front Lines." The surrounding voices became lively: "This time, we won't go home without capturing old Chiang alive!" "Comrades, perform meritorious service on the front lines!" The voices rang out loud and clear.
　　The comrades of the sixth team stretched their throats and shouted, "Comrades, going to the front lines is the most glorious." The fifth team, not wanting to be outdone, shouted in the loudest voice, "Study hard and defeat Chiang Kai-shek!" The fourth team waved their hands even more vigorously, shouting as if to overwhelm all other sounds, "Strive to be models in learning, strive to be heroes on the battlefield!" The meeting place was like a huge chorus of tens of thousands of people rising and falling. The upsurge of joining the army reached its peak.

　　授旗大会特写
    李嘉陵
    一群一群的新战士象潮水样的涌进了会场，跳着，笑着，一个一个的都穿得那么干净整齐，象做新郎一样压抑不住心中的喜悦，眉开眼笑的从心里喜在脸上。
    “开会啦！”集合的哨子一响，这里一堆，那里一块，分散的人立刻一排排坐得端端正正，数百双强烈的眼光直射在台上，他们忘记了北风的咆哮，寒冷的侵袭，期待的睁着两眼，等待着欢送代表们的祝福………。
    一个一个的代表，都以极兴奋的热忱讲完话下来了，最后轮到诵读市委写给他们的信，当那女同志兴奋而流畅的读完：“希望你们赶快学成杀敌本领，上前线立功，我们期待着你们的捷音，并愿早日看到你们胜利凯旋”。蹲在墙角里的一个黑胖子新战士猛地跳起来，象敲钟似的问道：“做不做得到？”哄然一声：“做得到！”数百双拳头象铁锤一样的举起来了。
    老王跑得满头大汗的把红旗拿来了，每个人的眼睛立刻转向了台上，授旗开始了，好象突然一阵狂风吹动着树枝，战士们的头左右摇摆着，巡视着红旗上的赠言——“革命先锋”、“为人民立功”……。代表们壮严而热情地把旗献给战士们，一张张红旗在空中飘扬，鼓励着战士们的热情，燃烧着战士们杀敌的心。
    王小牛和张心泰争着要拿红旗，郭银宝又嫌李福泉把旗举得太低了，后面的战士们吆喝着：“举高点，我们看不见。”小张从人群中冲了出来，掀起一张红旗念到：“前线立功”，周围的声音热闹起来了：“这次不活捉老蒋不回家！”“同志们前线立功！”的声音了亮的响着。
    那边六队的同志拉长着嗓子喊起来了：“同志们上前线是最光荣的。”五队也不示弱的用最高的声音叫着：“努力学习，打垮蒋介石！”四队更加劲的双手摇摆着，好象要压倒一切的声响似的喊着：“在学习中争模范，在战场上争英雄！”会场上好象有几万人在此伏彼起的进行大合唱，参军的热潮到达了最高点。
