　　Tianjin: Over Ten Thousand Students Parade Again
　　Holding High Chairman Mao's Image and Cheering "Long Live!"
    Major Middle Schools Prepare to Resume Classes Within the Week

　　[Tianjin Electric] Following the grand celebrations and parades by faculty, staff, and students of major universities and colleges such as Nankai, Beiyang, and the Women's Normal School, over ten thousand students held another grand celebration parade on the 18th. The parade procession stretched for several miles, led by an advance team carrying huge portraits of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Starting from the Municipal Middle School in the Old West Concession, the parade passed through areas such as Quanye Market. Spectators lined the streets along the route. Balconies and windows of buildings on both sides of the road were also filled with crowds, who cheered "Long Live!" towards the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with sustained applause. Costumed Yangko dance teams performed everywhere amidst the sounds of gongs and drums, and were warmly welcomed. Many students participating in the parade recalled the true and tragic scenes of the "July 5th" parade, where they were brutally massacred by the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit gang. They passionately denounced the various bloody crimes of the Chiang-Fu bandits to the residents, and promoted the countless instances of the Chinese Communist Party's care for young students. Currently, major universities and colleges in Tianjin have jointly established a propaganda committee. Using propaganda trucks, and through dance, songs, dramas, and other programs, they are publicizing the CCP's various urban policies and encouraging various industrial and commercial businesses to quickly resume work and production. On the 18th, students from Nankai University and Nankai Middle School also held a joint evening party with the People's Liberation Army, attended by more than 800 people.

　　[Tianjin Electric] Major universities and colleges in Tianjin, such as Nankai, Beiyang, the Women's Normal School, Hebei Institute of Technology, the College of Law and Commerce, the Municipal Middle School, and the Provincial Middle School, are actively preparing to resume classes within the week under the leadership of the Military Control Commission. Before the liberation of the city, the Kuomintang bandit army extensively damaged school buildings, forcibly occupied the school buildings of Nankai, Beiyang, the College of Law and Commerce, Hebei Institute of Technology, and other schools, and extensively built fortifications. The square on the north bank of the Heping Lake in the North Compound of Nankai was filled with trenches and bunkers. All the electrical lighting in the South Compound was completely destroyed, and the motor of the chemistry laboratory was also looted. Over 40% of the original school equipment in the two compounds was burned or destroyed. Trees on the Beiyang campus were all chopped down. Half of the desks, chairs, and wooden beds were chopped up and burned as firewood, and two school buildings were also burned down. The angle iron, steel plates, steel wires, etc. in the Hebei Institute of Technology factory were all taken away to be used for construction. Many of the desks and chairs in the College of Law and Commerce were either chopped up or burned, and some were even used as horse troughs. Teachers and students from Beiyang, the College of Law and Commerce, and the National Academy of Physical Education were forced to leave their schools and take refuge in the Women's Normal School. More than 2,000 faculty, staff, and students from Nankai were forced to crowd into the East Compound of the school. Faculty, staff, and students who had suffered such devastation at the hands of the Chiang bandits longed for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army day and night. When the sound of the cannons liberating Tianjin rang out, Nankai faculty and students crowded into the dormitories every night to listen to broadcasts from the Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an, and meticulously copied and collected the Xinhua News Agency editorial: "New Year's Message - Carry the Revolution Through to the End." The school staff who remained at Beiyang also spontaneously organized a volunteer school protection team to actively protect the school. Yu Changhai, the team leader and senior electrician, repeatedly led the school staff to brave dense artillery fire to fight fires, inspect circuits, and repair water pipes, so that important equipment such as books and instruments in the school could be preserved intact. Staff members who remained at the College of Law and Commerce also rescued many pieces of furniture amidst the hail of bullets and stored them away. Faculty and students at Nankai organized a security committee to lead the school protection work. During the war, more than 50 bandits and thugs attempted to break into the school to rob it, but were resolutely stopped by school staff members such as Zhang Demao, who quickly closed the school gates, thus averting the robbery. When inspectors from the Military Control Commission's Department of Culture and Education arrived at the schools on the morning of the 16th, all the faculty, staff, and students, except for the presidents of Nankai and Beiyang, were present in the schools. In addition to explaining our Party's various policies, the inspectors announced on the spot that all original faculty, staff, and students of the schools would remain in their positions as before and should actively protect the schools and be responsible for preparing for the resumption of classes. The faculty, staff, and students of all schools were extremely delighted.
