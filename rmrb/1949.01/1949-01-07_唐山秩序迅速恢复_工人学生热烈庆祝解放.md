Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 2nd. After the liberation of Tangshan City on the 12th of last month, order in the entire city was completely restored the next day. Pedestrians walked back and forth on the streets, shops opened for business, and the post office was restored on the afternoon of the second day. It is now open for postal service with all liberated areas of the country. Through the active repairs of workers, the telephone, in addition to the complete restoration in the city, long-distance telephones have been connected to Lutai in the west and Guye and Kailuan's three mines (Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, Tangjiazhuang) in the east. After we took over the Kuomintang's "China Cultural Service Society" printing factory on the 13th of last month, the workers immediately sorted out the machines and cleaned up the materials, and started work again on the morning of the 14th. They also offered three machine guns, more than eighty rifles, and hundreds of sets of single clothing hidden by the Chiang bandits. On the afternoon of the 14th, more than 1,000 workers from the Kailuan Coal Mine spontaneously held a victory parade. More than 2,000 representatives of teachers and students from eight middle schools in the city held a celebration meeting at Jiaotong University on the 15th. Jiaotong University was forced to move south by the Chiang bandits before liberation. Only sixty or seventy workers remained in the school. These workers also held up the school flag of Jiaotong University to join the celebration parade. Students from various middle schools have established a temporary preparatory committee for the Tangshan Student Union to prepare for the establishment of the Tangshan Student Union. As of the 14th, all primary and secondary schools have resumed classes, except for Yongren Middle School, which is still actively preparing to resume classes. The Jidong Xinhua Bookstore established a Tangshan branch on the 17th and started business, selling more than 1,200 books in two days. Citizens are scrambling to buy Chairman Mao's works such as "On Coalition Government" and "On New Democracy." Other books such as "Impressions of Mao Zedong" and "Evaluating China's Destiny" have also sold a lot. The Tangshan branch of the Xinhua News Agency was established on December 13th of last year. The city's people's newspaper, "New Tangshan Daily," was published on the 24th. After the democratic government changed the original Civil Education Center into a reading room, it was crowded with readers every day. The Jidong Military Region's cultural troupe held exhibitions on the production and construction of the liberated areas and the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army on the streets, broadcast songs on the Tangshan Broadcasting Station, and staged dramas at the Kailuan Club, which were warmly welcomed by the citizens. Citizens and propagandists actively scrubbed reactionary slogans and replaced them with new slogans and murals, and the city's appearance has been completely renewed. At the same time, trade organs transported a large amount of grain, and by the 15th, more than 200,000 jin had been transported, which was sold by six grain shops, so that grain prices generally fell. The value of the currency in the liberated area is increasing day by day.
