    [Hebei News] Inspired by the enthusiasm to support the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, workers and citizens and students in Baoding City have launched a donation and labor army movement. The working class has been the most active. All employees of the Hebei Daily Baoding Office, in addition to donating 637 yuan in cash (new currency, same below), also donated 1,020 yuan, the equivalent of one day's voluntary labor, entirely for the labor army. Sixty-four employees of the Baoding Iron Factory of the Jizhong Industrial Company donated 369 jin of rice. The workers of Fuhexing took out a total of 460 yuan. Xu Erbang and six other hired laborers from 50th Street in the Fourth District donated 190 yuan, saying, "Baoding is liberated, and workers can live.慰劳the People's Liberation Army to fight for Tianjin and Beijing to liberate the workers there!" Yang Chenkui, a cart driver from Xicaiyuan in the Third District, heard about the comforting effort and took the initiative to unite 16 colleagues including He Jinting and Yuan Changfu to hold a meeting, donating a total of 1,800 yuan. Yang Wenhua, an 18-year-old poor girl from the west side of the South Gate intersection, also donated 30 yuan. She couldn't even afford to eat, and went from house to house talking about the labor army. Students from the Women's Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, Baoding Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, Tongren, and Liren Elementary Schools made 130 comfort bags in two days, some embroidered with colorful threads and words such as "Liberate Tianjin and Beijing, Kill the Enemy and Make Meritorious Service." Female students from the Joint High School also brought out sewing machines to rush to make comfort bags. Male students bought daily necessities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, and towels. The Liberation Theater performed the historical drama "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" on the 5th, and all 6,450 yuan from ticket sales were donated to the labor army. This enthusiastic support-the-front and labor army movement is unfolding enthusiastically in Baoding.
    [Report] In order to respond to the government's call for a labor army, the North China Highway Bureau established a Labor Army Committee on the 14th of this month, led by comrades Lu Ying, Du Decun and other comrades to unify the overall labor army work. Comrades, with joyful expressions, were very enthusiastic. Comrade Lao Dong said, "The melon seeds are small, but they represent a bit of heart." Although their gifts are not many, they are all things that the comrades at the front need. Gloves can be worn when hands are cold, masks can be worn when it is windy, and towels, soap, toothbrushes, and toothpaste are all daily necessities. Comrades also carried out mutual challenges and responses in the labor army. Preliminary statistics: (in new currency) personnel department, design section, secretary office, general affairs section, accounting section and other comrades totaled 10,400 yuan. All have been bought into various gifts, are being concentrated. The remaining units are also in full swing. (Lu Ying, Asia)
    [Report] In the sound of constant victories, the 1st company of the North China Military Region Garrison × Battalion, enthusiastically participated in the labor army. Everyone dedicated all the shoes, socks, and allowances they had saved from frugal living while on guard, building houses, repairing roads, and digging tunnels day and night. Cooks Bai Fugui and Yuan Wenlian, wearing their own worn-out shoes and socks, donated two pairs of new shoes and socks that they had saved for more than a year, saying: "The old brothers at the front are bleeding and sweating in the wind and snow, and they have many difficulties. It's easy for us to talk about difficulties in the rear." Soldier Bai Baocai of the third squad, suppressed his cigarette addiction and borrowed 5,000 yuan to donate, saying: "This little money is really not presentable, but fortunately, 'Melon seeds are not full, but they represent people's hearts.'" Everyone also wrote letters of condolence. Squad Leader Wang Liansan of the 2nd squad said in his letter: "For the liberation of the people of the whole country, you are fighting the enemy day and night. You can't eat well, you can't drink well, and you sleep in the ice and snow at night. It's nothing for us to stand guard and do construction in the rear. We must learn from the old brothers. "Everyone has set a meritorious service plan to welcome victory. Strive to be responsible in the post." According to preliminary statistics, the entire row of the first platoon dedicated a total of 732,000 yuan of border currency, 18 pairs of shoes, 24 pairs of socks, 3 towels, 1 bar of soap, and 1 pencil.
