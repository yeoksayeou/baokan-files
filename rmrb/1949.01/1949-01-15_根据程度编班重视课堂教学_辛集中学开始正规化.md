　　Class Placement Based on Proficiency, Emphasis on Classroom Teaching
  　Xinji Middle School Begins Regularization
　　[This Newspaper's Report] Because the nature and tasks of general secondary education were not clearly defined in the past, coupled with high student mobility making it difficult to organize fixed grades, and the uneven proficiency levels of students in the same class, the first problem encountered in implementing regularization was how to classify students into general middle school classes, short-term middle school classes, and remedial classes based on their education level, age, and work experience, so that teaching could proceed smoothly, and the urgent need for cadres in work could be resolved. This is the first thing Xinji Middle School in Jizhong is doing to begin regularization.
　　Xinji Middle School has a total of eight classes of students, all newly recruited last year. Before the reorganization, students were given ample time to deliberate, and then a level placement test was conducted.
　　After the new guidelines and implementation measures were communicated, students generally wished to enter the three-year general middle school program, hoping to learn more before going out to work. If they couldn't get into the three-year program, they would enter the short-term middle school program, and they were most afraid of being assigned to the remedial class, feeling it was shameful and disappointing. Secondly, they were unwilling to enter the teacher training program, feeling that being a teacher had no future; superficially, they said, "I have little ability, no patience, and cannot do it." The leadership, based on the situation, focused on mobilizing older female students to enter the teacher training program, and explained the reasons for the class placement separately; explaining that personal aspirations should be considered in conjunction with the needs of the people, and using large and small meetings to mobilize students for repeated discussions. Finally, most students' thinking became clearer, realizing that older students should attend the one-year class, graduate early, and go out to work. Older female students are more suitable for teacher training programs; younger students with lower proficiency should take remedial courses. The students' opinions and the leadership's requirements were generally aligned, and the exam-based class placement was officially announced.
　　As a result of the reorganization, three classes were formed for the first year of the general middle school program, one class for the first year of the teacher training program, one class for the short-term middle school program, and two classes for the remedial program. Because the deliberation period was long, the general mood was stable after the class placement.
　　After rectifying the classes, the teaching difficulties caused by the uneven proficiency levels due to mixed class placement were overcome, and the phenomenon of students trying to keep up forcibly was reduced. Those assigned to the three-year program had long-term plans; those assigned to the short-term program had short-term plans. The students' enthusiasm for learning increased generally. In the past, there were too many transfers, and students could not settle down to study, and did not even want to buy books, using them collectively; now they are seriously building their learning assets, and books and stationery are all complete. However, in the short-term middle school program and the teacher training program, some students still lack sufficient understanding of the current situation and the needs of the war, and the idea of serving the people has not been clearly established, so their enthusiasm for learning is still not very high.
　　The teaching enthusiasm of the teachers has been greatly improved, and they have established the determination to engage in education for a long time. Because the schools were mostly "supply stations" and "fluid classes" in the past, teaching widely used collective discussion, which cultivated the teachers' habit of not preparing lessons adequately and being careless. For example, a history teacher in the school prepared thirteen lectures, which he had not finished teaching after several years. Now, with the emphasis on classroom teaching, teachers must also prepare adequately; homework guidance is also more serious than before. Therefore, teachers urgently request to strengthen business research, fearing that they will not be able to meet the students' requirements. Subject business groups have been organized, reporting progress on time every week, collectively discussing the teaching methods of a certain unit or even a certain lesson, reading and researching theoretical books related to the business, so that teaching has been greatly improved, and the initial foundation for regularization has been laid.
　　Furthermore, some regions and schools have not carried out the reorganization work seriously. Either they accommodated the students, regardless of their level, and without exams, all were assigned to formal classes; or they did not fully deliberate among the students and conduct ideological mobilization, and then forcibly assigned classes, resulting in a large number of dropouts among remedial class students.

### 根据程度编班重视课堂教学　辛集中学开始正规化

　　根据程度编班重视课堂教学
  　辛集中学开始正规化
    【本报讯】由于过去普通中学教育的性质和任务没有明确规定，加以学生流动性大，不易组织固定级别，而同班学生程度又极不齐，因此，执行正规化所遇到的第一个问题，就是如何根据文化程度、年龄、工作经历，分别编成普中班、短中班、补习班等，使教学得以顺利进行，工作上急需之干部，又可解决。这就是冀中辛集中学着手正规化首先要做的第一件事。
    辛中共有八班学生，都是去年新招的。整编前先让学生充分酝酿，然后进行编级测验。
    在新方针及实施办法传达后，学生普遍愿入三年制普中班，希望多学些东西再出去工作。三年制班进不成，就入短中班，最怕编到补习班，认为丢人败兴。其次，是不愿入师范班，感到当教员没前途；表面上则说：“能力小，不耐心，干不了。”领导上根据情况，着重动员年龄较大的女生入师范班，又分别解释分班的理由；说明个人志愿要和人民的需要联系起来考虑，并利用大会小会，发动学生反复讨论。最后，大多数学生思想较明确了，认识到年纪大一些的，应上一年班，早早毕业，出去工作。年龄大的女生上师范班比较适宜；年纪小的程度差的应补习。学生们的意见和领导上的要求大致趋于一致了，乃正式宣布考试编班。
    整编结果，编为普中班一年级三班，师范班一年级一班，短中班一班，补习班两班。由于酝酿时间较长，编班后，一般情绪安定。
    整顿班次以后，既克服了因混合编班程度不齐所引起的教学上的困难，又减少了学生间的硬等死赶的现象。编入三年制班的，有长期打算；编入短中班的，有短期的打算。学生学习情绪普遍高涨。过去调动太多，学生安不下心来学习，连书本也不想买，大伙儿凑合着用；现在都认真建设学习家当，书籍文具都闹齐备了。但短中班、师范班，仍有学生因对目前形势和战争需要认识不足，为人民服务的思想没有明确树立，学习情绪仍不很高。
    教员方面教学情绪大大提高，树立了长期从事教育事业的决心。由于过去学校多为“供应站”、“流水班”，教学广泛运用集体讨论，这样养成教员不充分准备功课粗枝大叶的作法。如该校一个历史教员准备了十三课讲义，用了几年还没教完。现在重视课堂教学，故教员亦不能充分准备；作业指导亦较前认真。因此教员迫切要求加强业务研究，唯恐不能满足学生要求。各科业务小组都组织起来，每周按时汇报进度，集体讨论某一单元以至某一课的教授方法，阅读和研究与业务有关的理论书籍，这样使教学方面大有改进，并打下了正规化的初步基础。
    又讯：有些地区某些学校没有严肃进行整编工作。或则迁就学生，不问程度如何，不加考试，均编入正式班次；或则未经过学生中充分酝酿，思想动员，即强制编班，致补习班学生发生大批退学现象。
