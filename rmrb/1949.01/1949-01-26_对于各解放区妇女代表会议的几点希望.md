　　Some Hopes for Women's Representative Conferences in Liberated Areas
    Deng Yingchao
    The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Women's Federation in the Liberated Areas issued a circular on December 5th last year, proposing to convene the First National Congress of Chinese Women. This proposal has received unanimous response from women's federations in the Liberated Areas and democratic women's groups and individuals in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, which is preparing to convene this congress, was established on the 12th of this month and has made specific provisions for convening the First National Congress of Chinese Women. Now, the preparatory committees of the women's federations in the three major Liberated Areas of Northeast China, East China, and Central Plains, as well as the women's federations in the two Liberated Areas of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui and the women's federations in various administrative regions of North China, have decided to convene women's representative conferences in their respective regions successively from late January to mid-February. At these conferences, the women's work in each region will be summarized, representatives to the First National Congress of Chinese Women will be elected, and the women's federation committees in each region will be established or re-elected respectively.

    We suggest to the comrades attending the meeting: First, at the women's representative conference, discuss the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the current work of rural women in the Liberated Areas in December last year, and check and summarize the past work based on this decision, formulate methods for implementing this decision in the future, and focus on studying and summarizing the experience of urban women's work. Second, promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism among the delegates attending the meeting, and overcome the thinking among female cadres who only rely on personal interests, attach importance to so-called personal development prospects, fear the trouble and difficulties of work, and are therefore unwilling to do women's work, or even despise women's work and do not care about women masses. We must raise the idea of serving the people, especially the broad masses of women. We must use the greatest enthusiasm to care about the interests of the broad masses of women, especially working women. Third, discuss the Second Circular of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation at the meeting, reach a consensus on the tasks of the First National Congress of Chinese Women as stipulated in the circular, and fully apply the principles of democracy to elect representatives to the First National Congress of Chinese Women. We must ensure that the outstanding people who have the closest ties with the masses in various work positions are elected as representatives. Fourth, we should be prepared before the meeting, and the meeting should be organized and carried out. According to the ideological trends of cadres, we should focus on ideological leadership, and the proposals and discussions should be concentrated on the main central issues, so that the meeting can be concluded quickly and successfully.

    We hope that the women's representative conferences in the Liberated Areas can become the key to greater development of women's work in the Liberated Areas, so that women's work in 1949 will achieve more and better results than in 1948.

    We hope that the success of the women's representative conferences in the Liberated Areas can lay a good foundation for the First National Congress of Chinese Women.

　　对于各解放区妇女代表会议的几点希望
    邓颖超
    中国解放区妇女联合会筹备会，在去年十二月五日发出通告，提议召开中国妇女第一次全国代表大会，这个提议，已经得到了各解放区妇女联合会及国民党统治区的各民主妇女团体人士的一致响应，筹备召集这个大会的全国民主妇女联合会筹备会，已于本月十二日成立，并对召开中国妇女第一次全国代表大会作了各项具体规定。现在东北、华东、中原三大解放区的妇女联合会筹备会，陕甘宁、晋绥两解放区和华北各行政区的妇女联合会，分别决定自一月下旬至二月中旬，先后召开各该区妇女代表会议。在这些会议中，将要总结各区妇女工作，选举各区出席中国妇女第一次全国代表大会的代表，分别成立或改选各区妇女联合会委员会。
    我们向参加会议的同志们建议：第一，在妇女代表会议上，讨论去年十二月中国共产党中央委员会关于目前解放区农村妇女工作的决定，根据这个决定来检查总结过去的工作，制定今后执行这个决定的办法，并着重研究、总结城市妇女工作的经验。第二，在到会代表中发扬批评与自我批评的精神，克服在女干部中只凭个人兴趣，重视所谓个人发展前途，畏惧工作的麻烦困难，因而不愿做妇女工作，甚至卑视妇女工作，不关心妇女群众的思想。要把为人民服务，特别是为广大妇女群众服务的思想提高一步。要用最大的热忱来关心广大妇女群众特别是劳动妇女们的利益。第三，在会议上讨论全国民主妇女联合会筹备会第二号通告，对于通告所规定的中国妇女第一次全国代表大会的任务，取得一致的认识，并且充分运用民主的原则，选举出席中国妇女第一次全国代表大会的代表。要使那些在各种工作岗位上与群众最有联系的优秀人物当选为代表。第四，在会前应有准备，对会议要有组织地去进行，根据干部思想动态，着重思想领导，对提议及讨论均应集中于主要中心问题，使会议能迅速开完，获得成功。
    我们希望：各解放区妇女代表会议，能够成为解放区妇女工作得到更大开展的关键，使一九四九年的妇女工作，比一九四八年有更多更好的成绩。
    我们希望：各解放区妇女代表会议的成功，能够给中国妇女第一次全国代表大会铺下良好的基础。
