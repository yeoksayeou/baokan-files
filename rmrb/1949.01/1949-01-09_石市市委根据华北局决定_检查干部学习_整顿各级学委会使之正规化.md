The Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee, Based on North China Bureau Decision, Inspects Cadre Study and Rectifies All Levels of Study Committees to Standardize Them

[This Newspaper’s News] After the North China Bureau issued its decision on the education of cadres in service, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee examined the problems existing in cadre study over the past year. The main shortcomings were: First, in terms of study content, the past emphasis was on studying current events and policies, and the arrangement of study was relatively piecemeal. Upon seeing documents published by the Central Committee or hearing reports from responsible comrades, notices were issued for study. There had not yet been a systematic and planned study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, nor a sufficient study of the general policy and general line. Therefore, the understanding of the Party's specific policies was not comprehensive or profound, and many deviations occurred during implementation. Second, study methods: Emphasis was placed on collective discussions, linking theory with practice, reviewing work, and self-reflection, but there was a lack of individual reading and deep thinking. There was a lack of preparation before meetings, and discussions were random and irrelevant. Reviewing work and self-reflection often lacked planning, resulting in a lack of depth or abandonment halfway. Some mechanically and rigidly linked theory with practice, and a few even circled around personal experience, unable to take a step forward. This kind of study method is empiricism. Third, the organizational leadership was unsound: the city had not established a general study committee, and some department study committees had not played their role, resulting in a considerable degree of laissez-faire. Most department heads and agency leaders did not set an example by personally taking charge of leadership, often using the excuse of "being busy with work and not having time." Some formed a "the bottom moves, the top doesn't move" phenomenon. After reviewing the above shortcomings, the Municipal Party Committee made the following decision on December 24: 1. Strengthen theoretical study. Departments can be divided into Class A and Class B according to the political and cultural level of cadres. Class A (generally cadres above the prefectural committee level) will study the five great works, starting with "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific." Class B will study "The Development of Society." 2. Cadres with low cultural levels must strengthen cultural study. This study must be compulsory for cadres with existing primary and senior primary school levels, regardless of their rank. The Municipal Education Bureau will organize cadre cultural remedial classes, and various departments and industries will organize cultural study classes, designating specific personnel to be responsible for leading the study. In the suburban areas, the work teams sent to the countryside will be organized into study groups. 3. Strengthen the study of current events and policies. Every cadre must ensure they read the newspaper every day. Policy study can involve discussing and researching the work summaries of various departments. The day after the Municipal Party Committee issued this decision, it convened a city-wide cadre meeting. Mayor Ke delivered a report mobilizing study. Before December 31st, all departments had established and rectified their study committees, formulated specific study plans, and prepared to start studying according to the newly formulated plans on the 4th of next year.

　　石市市委根据华北局决定
  　检查干部学习
  　整顿各级学委会使之正规化
    【本报讯】华北局在职干部教育决定发出后，石家庄市委检讨了一年来的干部学习中所存在的问题，主要的缺点是：一、学习内容上过去是强调学习时事与政策，布置学习是比较零碎的，看到中央发表的文件或听了负责同志的报告就通知学习，尚未有系统有计划的进行过马列主义基本理论的学习，与十分缺乏总政策总路线的学习，因此对党的具体政策的了解，也就不会全面深刻，在执行中曾发生过不少偏向。二、学习方法：强调集体漫谈讨论、连系实际、检查工作、反省自己，缺乏个人阅读、深思熟虑，会前缺乏准备，讨论时随想随说，不着边际，在检查工作、反省自己时亦往往缺乏计划，结果极不深入，或半途而废。有的是机械的生硬的联系实际，有少数人甚至在个人的经验上打圈子，不能向前提高一步，这种学习方法是经验主义的。三、组织领导不健全：全市未建立总学委会，各部门学委会有的亦未发挥作用，自流现象相当严重，各部门机关首长大多没有以身作则亲自掌握领导，往往借口“工作忙，没有时间”，有的形成了“下动上不动”的现象。以上缺点，经过检讨后，市委于十二月二十四日特作如下决定：一、加强理论学习，各部门按照干部的政治文化水平可编成甲、乙两班，甲班（一般的在地委以上干部）学习五大名著，首先学习社会主义从空想到科学的发展，乙班学习社会发展史。二、文化水平低的干部必须加强文化学习，这种学习对于现有初小高小程度的干部，不管是那一级的都必须是带有强制性，全市有教育局主办干部文化补习班，各部门各行组织文化学习班，指定专人负责领导学习，市郊区按下乡的工作组编成学习小组。三、加强时事与政策学习，每个干部每天要保证阅读报纸，政策学习可把各部门的工作总结进行讨论研究。市委发出这个决定后的第二天，召集了全市干部大会，由柯市长做动员学习的报告后，三十一号以前各部门都已建立与整顿了学委会，订出具体的学习计划，准备在明年四号开始按照新订的计划进行学习。
