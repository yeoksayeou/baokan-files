　　To Clarify Objectives and Mobilize the Masses is Key to Successfully Completing Land Reform
　　Yü-she Summarizes Fifty Days of Experience
　　[Taihang Telegram] In order to better promote the advancement of work, Yü-she County convened an enlarged cadre meeting of the county, districts, and villages on December 21st of last year to summarize and examine the work of the past fifty days in concluding land reform and rectifying the Party. The following are some of the basic experiences gained:

　　(1) It is essential to clearly recognize that this conclusion of land reform still adheres to the basic policy of relying on poor and hired peasants, uniting with middle peasants, and organizing a strong mass force, and is not severing history to guide the movement. Therefore, the question of who will lead, rely on, and unite with in concluding land reform must be clarified in the minds of cadres, and in practical work, continuous struggle must be waged against left and right-leaning erroneous ideas. Only in this way can the masses be mobilized to unite the majority, and only then can policies be correctly implemented. At the beginning of the movement, some liberated households reflected a sentiment of "not being glorious in liberation," believing that the past movement was completely wrong, and thus felt that the fruits they had been given were not secure. In addition, due to the failure to properly resolve the errors of the "poor peasant line" last spring, some peasants felt uneasy, and even dissatisfied. Based on these situations, the county universally convened symposiums of poor and hired peasants (including new middle peasants) to publicize and explain policies, so that everyone could realize that the conclusion of land reform was for the purpose of consolidating the gains already made and uniting to develop production. In this way, not only were their doubts about the policy stabilized and overcome, but their enthusiasm was also aroused, making them a reliable force in the movement. Some villages also conducted an "untying of knots," criticizing those with extremely democratic tendencies, so that some ideological rifts among the peasants were resolved, and they tended to unite. In the process of classifying class status and preparing compensation, some wrongly struggled middle peasants were dissatisfied with the method of merely mending holes and patching things up. To this end, many villages convened meetings of wrongly struggled middle peasants (some called them peasant homecoming meetings, others called them unity meetings). After appropriate self-criticism and apologies from the leadership, and democratic discussion by everyone, they gradually tended to unite under the common goal of consolidating land gains and uniting to develop production, becoming a strong mass organization in concluding land reform. However, some villages did not clearly understand this policy and did not dare to hold such meetings openly, only conducting simple material compensation, which failed to achieve the goal of unity.

　　(2) Enlightening Party members to be conscious and examine their own mistakes. Being prepared to proactively solve some specific problems at any time in the movement (such as returning excessively distributed fruits, etc.) and mediate the relationship between cadres and the masses is the main key to the development of the movement. More than two thousand Party members in the county participated in short-term meetings to discuss policies; most villages also solved some problems in conjunction with the meetings, and then mobilized them to lead the movement. For example, some villages, in the process of classifying class status and formulating plans for filling gaps and resettlement, discovered that many specific problems were related to Party members and cadres. They were then educated to recognize that selfishness, pursuit of privilege, and blind and reckless work were all impure manifestations, harmful to the Party and the masses. They were enlightened to have revolutionary consciousness, be courageous in self-examination, improve their awareness, and strengthen the leadership of the Party branch. The experience of resolving problems within the Party branch itself, especially resolving factional problems, is to first provide some basic Party education within the branch, and then draw a clear class line ideologically, so that the ideological awareness of Party members and the principles of the Party are improved a step further, and the problem will be easier to solve. For example, some village Party members, after studying the Party Constitution and the Party branch textbook (compiled and printed by the District Party Committee), reflected that they now understand that engaging in factionalism is a small group, a small organization, which violates the organizational principles of the Party, and is not the ideology of the proletariat. Experience has proven that this approach will not trap Party rectification in unprincipled debates on specific matters; coupled with correctly relying on activists, carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and the supervision and assistance of the masses, the ideology will be deeply rooted, and the problem will be fundamentally solved. Experience has also proven that not only is concluding land reform a good opportunity to solve and improve the ideological awareness of Party members, but the two must be combined; otherwise, concluding land reform will not be successful, and Party rectification will fall into an isolated circle of settling old scores.

　　In addition, some shortcomings were also identified: First, the policy of combining the conclusion of land reform with Party rectification was not clear enough in guiding ideology at the beginning, so some problems that could have been solved in conjunction with the movement were intentionally not solved, attempting to have another Party rectification stage. This not only weakened the leadership role in concluding land reform, but also created a phenomenon of dealing with things as they are. Even if land reform is concluded, the awareness of Party members and the masses cannot be significantly improved. This is a problem that must be solved in future work. Secondly, in ideological guidance, the blockage of empiricism prevented good acceptance and understanding of objective things. For example, some ideological demands of the masses and cadres were not developed and studied in a timely manner, and appropriately resolved; the acceptance of instructions from higher levels and experience from other places was also very blind, so the integration of studying the actual situation of the county when implementing instructions and applying experience was very poor.

### 弄清目的发动群众才能做好结束土改　榆社总结五十天经验

　　弄清目的发动群众才能做好结束土改
  　榆社总结五十天经验
    【太行电】榆社为了更好的推动工作前进，特于去年十二月二十一日召开全县县区村扩大干部会议，总结检查五十天来的结束土改与整党工作。兹将其获得的几点基本经验介绍如下：
    （一）必须明确认识这次结束土改，仍是贯彻依靠贫雇、团结中农、组织强大群众队伍的基本方针，不是割断历史来指导运动。因此结束土改究竟是要谁来领导，依靠谁，团结谁的问题，就必须在干部思想上明确起来，在实际工作中不断地与左右倾错误思想作斗争。只有这样，才能发动群众团结大多数；亦才能正确地执行政策。在运动开始时，有些村的翻身户，即曾反映着一种“翻身不光荣”的情绪，认为过去运动全错了，因而感到自己分的果实不牢靠。另外，由于去春“贫雇路线”的错误没有得到适当解决，使部分农民情绪不安，甚至不满。根据这些情况，全县普遍召开了贫雇农（包括新中农在内）座谈会，宣传讲解政策，使大家体会到结束土改是为了巩固已得成果及团结发展生产。这样一来，不但稳定与克服了他们对政策的怀疑，同时亦唤起了他们的积极性，成为运动中的依靠力量。有的村并进行了解“圪塔”，批评了有极端民主倾向的人，使农民间的一些思想隔阂得到解决，趋于团结。在划阶级与准备补偿中，部分错斗中农不满意尽补钉补窟窿的办法。为此，不少村庄召开了错斗中农会议（有的叫农民回家会，有的叫团结会），经过领导上的适当检讨与道歉，及大家民主讨论后，在巩固土地成果、团结发展主产的共同目标下，逐渐趋于团结，成为结束土改中强大的群众组织。但也有部分村对这一方针不明确，不敢放手举行这样的会议，只单纯进行物质补偿，结果未达到团结的目的。
    （二）启发党员自觉，检查自己错误。在运动中随时准备主动的解决一些具体问题（如退出多分果实等），调解干群关系，是运动开展的主要关键。全县二千余党员，分别参加了短期会议，作了政策讨论；大部村庄并结合解决了一部分问题，进而动员他们起来领导运动。如有些村在划阶级与订填补、安置方案中，发现连系到很多与党员干部有关的具体问题，即教育党员认识自私自利、特权思想、盲干乱干等都是不纯的表现，对党和群众有害，启发党员革命自觉，勇于自我检讨，提高了党员觉悟，加强了支部的领导力量。解决支部本身问题，特别是解决宗派问题的经验是：首先在支部给以一些党的基本教育，然后在思想上划清阶级界线，使党员的思想觉悟与党的原则性提高一步后，问题便好解决了。如有些村的党员，在学习了党章与支部教材（区党委编印）后反映说：现在才知道闹宗派是小集团、小组织，是违犯党的组织原则的，这不是无产阶级的思想。经验证明，这样作就不会把整党陷于就事论事的无原则的争论里去；再加上正确的依靠积极分子，开展党内的批评与自我批评，与群众的监督协助，就会把思想深入下去，使问题从根本上得到解决。经验也证明，不仅结束土改是解决与提高党员思想觉悟的好机会，而且两者必须结合起来；否则结束土改就搞不好，整党也会陷入孤立的算旧账的圈子里。
    另外也检查出了一些缺点：着先是对结束土改同时结合整党这一方针，由于在指导思想上开始时不够明确，因此曾经在运动中把有些可以结合解决的问题，也有意的不去解决，企图另来个整党阶段，这样不但对结束土改削弱了领导作用，同时也会产生就事论事的现象。即使结束了土改，党员群众的觉悟仍不能有显著提高。这将是今后工作必须解决的问题。其次在思想指导上，也因经验主义的堵塞，不能很好的接受与认识客观事物。如对群众与干部的一些思想要求不能及时的发展与研究，并加以适当的解决；对接受上级指示与别处经验也很盲目，因此在执行指示与运用经验时，结合研究本县的实际情况就很差。
