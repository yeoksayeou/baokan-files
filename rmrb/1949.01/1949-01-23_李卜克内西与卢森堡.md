Liebknecht and Luxemburg
    The outstanding warriors of the German proletariat, Liebknecht and Luxemburg, were murdered by the Social Democratic government on January 15 of the same month for leading the armed struggle of Berlin workers in January 1919. It has been thirty years since their glorious sacrifice.
    Liebknecht was the founder of the German "Spartacus League" and the German Communist Party, and a famous fighter against the imperialist war during the First World War. Liebknecht was born in 1871. He joined the workers' movement in his youth and struggled to establish a fighting socialist youth organization. During the First World War, he bravely opposed the war and was the only Social Democratic member of parliament to vote against the military loan bill in December 1914. He was arrested in 1916 and sentenced to four years of hard labor. His speech in the military court played a huge role in promoting the mass movement against the imperialist war.
    Luxemburg was a female revolutionary fighter, born in Poland in 1871. She was an outstanding activist in the German and Polish workers' movements, a left-wing leader of the German Social Democratic Party, and one of the founders of the German Communist Party. In 1893, she played a leading role in establishing the "Social Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania." Since 1897, she has been an active worker in the German Social Democratic Party. During the imperialist war, she was imprisoned for almost the entire time, but still participated in organizing the "Spartacus League" against the imperialist war. She made great contributions in the struggle against social chauvinism. During the bourgeois revolution in Germany in 1918, she firmly believed that it was necessary to break with the opportunists, and together with Liebknecht established the German Communist Party.
