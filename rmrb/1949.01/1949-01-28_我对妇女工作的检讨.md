　　My Self-Criticism on Women's Work
    黎暗

    Generally, female comrades are unwilling to do women's work and prefer to go to other departments or do comprehensive work. They have a contemptuous attitude towards women's work, forgetting that the liberation of women is a major event that women themselves should strive for. After the Central Committee published the "Decision on Current Rural Women's Work in Liberated Areas" in the People's Daily on December 26th last year, I re-examined my thoughts on women's work over the past ten years. I had many incorrect ideas about doing women's work:

    I. I did not regard women's work as an important part of the overall work. When work was assigned, I was happy to do other work, but when assigned to women's work, I felt unspeakable pain and embarrassment. Although I accepted the task on the surface, it was not from the heart, but out of necessity. So, whenever I had the opportunity, I would ask to leave women's work. Although in practical work, I already felt that other work was difficult to do in areas where women's work was weak, and in areas where women's work was relatively good, many tasks progressed more smoothly. For example, during the land reform, if the wives of male village cadres participated, they not only did not hinder the work but also became assistants. An Jun, the wife of Lao Gao, a public security officer outside the East Gate of Handan City, actively participated in village work and greatly encouraged Lao Gao's work. However, in some places, due to the low level of awareness among women, they even forbade men who allowed them to work from eating, causing trouble. During meetings, they would send children to call them away. Such incidents often hindered the work, and male village cadres and male peasant association members were ideologically affected. These are all personal experiences: It is impossible to do without women's work! However, I still did not put women's work first in my mind, and I did not properly organize them to help them seek liberation themselves. So, whenever women's work came up, I always pushed it back, and when it became unavoidable, I would just leave it alone. Just as the deputy director of the women's association in Songzhuang, Handan City (a young woman), criticized me, saying: "You are busy all day long, you have time to attend other meetings, but you don't have time for our women's meetings? Sigh! You really are! Others don't care about us women, and you don't care either!" Now, upon examination, it is not a matter of not having time, but of not paying attention to it in my mind. So, whenever there was a women's meeting, I always felt that other things were more important than the women's affairs, so I procrastinated.

    II. I thought that doing women's work would hinder my own "progress." Seeing that the female comrades in other departments were well-organized in life and study, while doing women's work prevented me from being so, and because some places did not value female cadres in work instructions, cadre training, and promotions (also my personal perception), I also thought that doing women's work was a waste of time and would not lead to progress. This is such a selfish way of looking at things, only considering my own "desire for progress," and not regarding the liberation of women as my duty. I didn't realize that I could still progress by doing women's work! Now I am ashamed upon examination. I should correct this in the future and strive for the liberation of women for the rest of my life.

    III. There is also an incorrect idea that women's work is troublesome and trivial. Rural women are very enthusiastic and often treat the working comrades as sisters or daughters. They care about the female comrades working in their areas in every way, but when they raise problems, I feel that they are "minor matters" that are not worth mentioning, troublesome! I don't understand that they have been in a state of oppression and restraint since birth, and what they see and come into contact with every day is of course trivial matters of daily life. If we do not sympathize with them and help them to remove various restraints, but only dislike it as troublesome and unwilling to solve it, and push it away twice or three times, then it shows that my mass viewpoint is greatly one-sided. In the future, I should always be vigilant about the viewpoint of not paying attention to women's work in my work, vigorously overcome my own individualism in my work, as well as the idea of being afraid of the trouble of women's work, and be determined to strive for the liberation of all women, to achieve the liberation of all mankind!

### 我对妇女工作的检讨

　　我对妇女工作的检讨
    黎暗
    一般的女同志不愿意做妇女工作，愿意到其他部门里，或者做全面工作，对妇女工作是轻视的态度，忘掉了解放妇女是妇女本身应努力的一件大事。去年十二月二十六日，人民日报登了中央关于目前解放区农村妇女工作决定后，使我对十年来妇女工作的思想做了一下检查。我对做妇女工作有很多不正确的思想：
    一、没有把妇女工作当成整个工作中的重要部分，在分配工作时，让做其他工作就愉快；让做妇女工作，思想里就有说不出的痛苦与难堪。虽然表面上接受了任务，也不是从心所欲，不得已而为之，所以一遇到空子，就要求脱离妇女工作。虽然在实际工作中，已经感到妇女工作薄弱的地区，其他工作难作，妇女工作比较好的地区，许多工作在进度上就比较顺利。如土地改革中有男村干部的老婆参加，她不但不阻碍，而且成了工作中的助手。邯郸市东门外公安员老高的老婆安俊，她积极的参加了村中工作，对老高的工作也给很大的鼓舞，但有的地方由于妇女觉悟不高，甚至不许她做工作的男人吃饭，闹蹩扭，在开会时叫孩子去叫。诸如此类，常使工作受到阻碍，男村干部和男农会会员在思想上受到影响。这些都是亲身体验到的：不做妇女工作不行！但自己思想里，仍没有把妇女工作放在第一位，没有好好去组织她们帮助她们自求解放，所以每当妇女工作一来，一直是向后推，推到不可开交的时候，就放起来不管。正如邯郸市宋庄妇会副主任（青年妇女）批评我说：“你整天忙，开别的会就有空，咱妇女开会就没空？咳！你真是！别人不管咱妇女吧，你也不管！”现在检查起来，不是没空的问题，而是思想里不重视，所以每逢妇女开会，总觉着其他的事比妇女们的事更重要，于是就推拖下来了。
    二、认为做妇女工作对自己的“进步”有妨碍，看到其他部门的女同志，在生活上、学习上都是井井有条，而做妇女工作就不能这样，在工作指示上、干部培养提拔上，由于有些地方不重视妇女干部（也是我个人认识），也使我认为做妇女工作是白耗费时间，做妇女工作不能进步。这种只从自己“要求进步”来看问题，不以解放妇女为自己的天职，不知做妇女工作也同样能进步，这是多么自私呀！现在检查起来真是惭愧，今后应当切实纠正，要终身为妇女解放而努力。
    三、还有一种不正确的思想，就是嫌妇女工作麻烦琐碎。农村妇女很热情、对工作同志常亲之如姐妹、如儿女，她们处处关心着在她区工作的女同志，但是当她们提出问题时，自己感到那是“小事”，不值得提，麻烦！不了解她们从生下来就是处在被压迫被束缚的境地，她们每天所接触的、看到的，当然是日常生活的琐事，我们不去同情他，帮助她们解除各种束缚，只是嫌麻烦，不愿解决。三推两推就放下了，还说明自己的群众观点是有很大的片面性的。今后应当时刻警惕在工作中的不重视妇女工作的观点，大力克服自己工作中的个人主义，以及怕妇女工作麻烦的思想，下定决心为整个妇女解放而努力，达到全人类的解放！
