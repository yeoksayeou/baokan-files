    【Beiyue Telegram】The leadership of the Party committees at all levels in the Fourth Special District of Beiyue over education work is very weak, which prevents the rapid development of education work. According to the reports from various counties at the special district education conference last October: county and district committees rarely personally participate in guiding education conferences or discussing plans for education work. When education departments submit education work plans to the Party committee for review, the Party committee often irresponsibly says: "You can handle it as you see fit!" The best-case scenario is when the Party committee sends one or two cadres to participate when an education conference is held.
    The government combined civil affairs, education, and justice into one section. Later, at the special commissioner's office, county, and district levels, there were no dedicated personnel responsible for overseeing education work. The school supervisor of Lingshou was assigned to a district and village to work on the central task of creating a model village. Education section staff in Xingtang, Quyang, Zhengding and other counties were dispatched to support the front lines or go to the countryside for central tasks for extended periods, and were unable to manage daily work in the section. Before the autumn break, the Huolu Education Section still did not know how many primary schools there were in the county, how many school-age children were enrolled, which teachers were good, and which teachers were bad; at the same time, there was no contact with the special commissioner's office. Although Fuping is a county with relatively good education work, the Education Section also had no one going to the countryside.
    District-level education institutions are very incomplete and neglect education work. For example, in Jingxing, Huolu, Lingshou and other counties, some civil affairs and education assistants are illiterate; many districts have formed a situation of not asking about education work, and teachers have to go directly to the county to solve any problems. Because the county education section often has no one, the problem is delayed and cannot be resolved for a long time. Some treat teachers as ordinary cadres, arbitrarily grabbing and transferring them, completely divorced from education work.
    Some villages do not provide teachers with food or do not provide it in a timely manner, and the county and district cannot handle it in a timely manner, resulting in school closures. In the thirty-three primary schools in the third district of Xingtang, six schools were open before the wheat harvest break, while others were closed due to the failure to provide teachers with food. In early June, Lingshou organized 101 teachers into a work team and assigned them to villages in the fourth and fifth districts to carry out a campaign to expand the army and return to the team, which lasted for ten to twenty days. The first district office asked teachers to engage in sales and transportation for two months.
    In terms of leadership, the special commissioner's office, counties, and districts often perform routine duties, only making arrangements, not conducting inspections; or having reviews without making improvements.
    After reviewing the above deviations, the special commissioner's office, various counties are now correcting them. The Lingshou County Head personally participated in the education conference and made a review report, and the Jianping County Committee personally participated in guiding the teacher evaluation work. As a result, education work in Lingshou and Jianping has now made new progress.

### 对教育不能再忽视了　北岳四专区检查改进教育工作

　　对教育不能再忽视了
  　北岳四专区检查改进教育工作
    【北岳电】北岳四专区各级党委对教育工作的领导很薄弱，使教育工作不能迅速发展。据去年十月专区教育会议上各县反映：县委、区委很少亲自参加指导教育会议或商讨计划教育工作。教育部门交党委审查教育工作计划时，党委时常是不负责任的说：“你们看着办吧！”最好的情况是当开教育会议时，党委派一两个干事去参加。
    政府民、教、司合科，后专署、县、区三级都没有专人负责掌握教育工作。灵寿督学被固定到一个区、村作典型村的中心工作。行唐、曲阳、正定等县教育科员，长期支前或下乡作中心工作，却不能在科里料理日常工作。获鹿教育科在秋假前还不知道全县有多少小学，多少学龄儿童入学，那些教员好，那些教员差；同时和专署也没有联系。阜平虽然是教育工作较好的县份，但教育科也没有人下乡。
    区级教育机构很不健全，且忽视教育工作。如井陉、获鹿、灵寿等县，有的民教助理员就不识字；很多区形成对教育工作不闻不问，教员有什么问题也得直接到县解决。因县教育科又经常没人，就把问题耽搁了，长期不得解决。有的把教员当成一般干部使用，乱抓乱调，完全脱离教育工作。
    村中有的不供给教员粮食或供给的不及时，县区又不能及时处理，以致因此停学。行唐三区三十三座小学，麦假前有六座开学，其他则因不供给教员粮食而停了学。灵寿在六月初，把一百零一个教员组成工作队，分到四五区各村去突击扩军归队工作，一直进行了十天到廿天。一区区公所叫教员搞了两个月的运销。
    专署、县区在领导上，常是例行公事，只有布置，没有检查；或有检讨，没有改进。
    该专署对上述偏向作了检讨后，现各县已在纠正。灵寿县长曾亲自参加教育会议作检查报告，建屏县委亲自参加指导教员鉴定工作。因之灵寿、建屏的教育工作现在都有了新的进展。
