　　Complete My Learning Tasks Now
  　Strive to Catch Up with You in the Future
    ——Liang Lanfang's Words

    Brave and dear elder brothers of the Northeast People's Liberation Army:

    You have completely liberated the Northeast, and also annihilated more than a million of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. I think this is because you were brave, unafraid of sacrifice, and fought the enemy in a hail of bullets. Finally, you won, allowing the 34 million people of the Northeast to gain freedom and happiness. Furthermore, in order to quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek and establish a new China, you tirelessly came to North China to help us eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops in North China, so that we in North China can also achieve freedom and liberation sooner. I cannot express my gratitude for your kindness. Now I can only complete my learning tasks and strive to catch up with you in the future, so that we can jointly build a new China. And I also hope that you will quickly capture Peiping and Tianjin, and we can hold a celebration meeting together.

    　　　　　Respectfully wishing
    You many victories
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhengding Fourth Complete Primary School, Fifth Grade, Class A Student Liang Lanfang

　　现在完成我的学习任务
  　将来向你们看齐
    ——梁兰芳的话英勇亲爱的东北人民解放军大哥们：
    你们把东北完全解放了，又歼灭了蒋介石一百多万兵，我想这是由于你们英勇不怕牺牲在枪林弹雨中和敌人搏斗，最后你们胜利了。使东北三千四百万人民得到自由幸福，并且你们为了迅速提早打垮蒋介石，建立新中国，又不停息的来到华北，帮助我们消灭华北蒋傅匪军，也使我们华北早些得到自由解放。你们这种恩惠我是无法表达出来的。我现在只有完成我的学习任务，将来向你们看齐，咱们共同建设新中国。并且我还布望你们迅速打下平津，我们在一起开个庆祝大会。
    　　　　　敬祝
    你们多打胜仗
