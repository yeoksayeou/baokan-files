　　People's Bank of China Answers
  　Various Questions Regarding the Issuance of New Currency
    Since the issuance of the new currency, our newspaper has received many inquiries from readers in various regions, all of which have been forwarded to the bank. Now, the bank is providing a systematic response to help cadres in various regions understand the actual situation and to assist the masses in conducting in-depth explanations.
    (1) Why is it necessary to issue the People's Bank of China currency?
    In the past, our liberated areas, due to being in an environment of enemy division and blockade, had to issue locally circulated currencies, which achieved great success in protecting the people's wealth, supporting the war, and developing production. Now, with the victorious development of the People's Liberation War, the liberated areas have been completely consolidated and connected as one. Material exchanges and trade between regions are developing rapidly. Under these circumstances, in order to adapt to the needs of economic development and to welcome the new situation of national victory, issuing a unified new currency has become an urgent need. If a unified new currency is not issued to this day, it will not only cause great difficulties for commercial exchanges between regions and for the supply and procurement work of various field corps in coordinated operations, but also greatly hinder the rapid elimination of enemy currency, the establishment of a local currency market, the stabilization of prices, and the restoration of order in many newly liberated large cities in the future. For example, if the Tianjin area is liberated and seven or eight currencies are allowed to circulate simultaneously with varying exchange rates, the market will be very chaotic, and merchants and the public will feel extremely inconvenienced. After the issuance of the People's Bank currency, the new areas can only use a single currency. If necessary, one or two old currencies can be used as small change, making it very convenient to use and calculate.
    In the future, the people of our liberated areas can use the People's Bank currency to buy things anywhere in the liberated areas. Before the various old currencies are withdrawn, the People's Bank currency and these old currencies will be used at a fixed exchange rate. This will save the trouble of exchanging and avoid losses due to exchange rate fluctuations, which is very beneficial for trade and economic development.
    (2) How is the exchange rate between the People's Bank currency and other old currencies determined?
    The exchange rate between the People's Bank currency and other old currencies is determined based on the price levels in each region. The purchasing power of the People's Bank currency is roughly the same in various regions. Since the price levels vary in different liberated areas, the exchange rate between the People's Bank currency and various old currencies is also different, but the basis for the regulations is the same. Based on the above principles, in order to facilitate the people's pricing and use, our government has fixed the exchange rate between the People's Bank currency and various old currencies as follows:
    One yuan of People's Bank currency equals 100 yuan of Ji'nan currency, Bohai currency, and Central China currency.
    One yuan of People's Bank currency equals 1,000 yuan of Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region currency, Northeast Circulation Certificates, Great Wall Circulation Certificates, and Rehe Circulation Certificates.
    One yuan of People's Bank currency equals 2,000 yuan of Xibei Nongmin Bank currency.
    One yuan of People's Bank currency equals 5,000 yuan of Ji-Re-Liao Border Region currency.
    One yuan of People's Bank currency equals two yuan of Zhongzhou currency.
    The above exchange rates have been fixed and will never change.
    (3) Why is the value of the People's Bank currency higher than the local currencies of each region?
    The value of the People's Bank currency is higher than the value of the local currencies of each region because prices have gradually risen over the past decade, and the value of various currencies is too low. For example, a 500-yuan Ji currency note is only equivalent to a little more than five cents before the war, which is really inconvenient for calculation. Wholesale transactions and counting in cities often encounter great difficulties. In order to meet the needs of large urban transactions and to facilitate the receipt, payment, storage, calculation, and carrying of public and private funds, the value of the new currency has been appropriately increased, 100 times higher than the Ji'nan currency, Bohai currency, and Central China currency. The newly issued 50-yuan note, although equivalent to 5,000 yuan of Ji'nan currency or Bohai currency, seems large, but is only worth less than five jiao when converted to pre-war currency, which is still too small for large urban transactions. Therefore, the People's Bank of China has decided to issue six denominations of new currency: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 20 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Some people think that the face value of the new currency is large, which is because they are used to spending local currencies and cannot adjust to the new currency immediately.
    (4) Will the higher purchasing power of the new currency compared to the old currencies cause price increases?
    The high exchange rate of the People's Bank currency is completely different from price increases. Because spending a ten-yuan People's Bank currency note is the same as spending a one-thousand-yuan Ji currency note in the market. The impact of currency on prices depends on the amount of issuance. As long as we appropriately limit the amount of issuance, it will not lead to price increases. Due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, our currency market has rapidly expanded. The people in many newly liberated areas automatically refuse to use the Kuomintang's paper money. The amount of currency in the liberated areas is insufficient and has not kept up in time to occupy the market. Therefore, market transactions often encounter great difficulties. At the same time, some areas may experience temporary price increases due to the concentration of large armies and difficulties in supplying materials. This temporary phenomenon is difficult to completely avoid in large-scale wars, but it will never last long. At present, the liberated areas are rapidly expanding, railway and highway transportation will be fully restored, the scope of material adjustment will be increased, especially with the development of people's production, the materials in the liberated areas are becoming increasingly abundant, and our currency is supported by the huge materials of state-owned enterprises. More importantly, our prudent issuance policy that serves the people's production is completely different from Jiang Jieshi's indiscriminate issuance of paper money. Therefore, the increase in the value of the new currency will not lead to price increases.
    (5) How far will the People's Bank currency travel?
    The People's Bank currency was first issued on December 1st of last year and circulated in the liberated areas of North China, Shandong, and Northwest China. Then it gradually spread to other liberated areas. Now various local currencies can still circulate as usual. In order to avoid making the types of banknotes in the market too complicated, except for the Northeast Circulation Certificates and Ji currency that can circulate in the Tianjin area, the Ji currency border currency and Xibei Nongmin Bank currency that are uniformly circulated in North China and Northwest China, and the Ji currency border currency and Bohai currency that are uniformly circulated in North China and East China, the banknotes in various liberated areas are connected to each other and have fixed exchange rates, avoiding the impact of exchange rate changes, but they are not mutually circulated. Only the People's Bank currency is now circulating in the vast area south of the Great Wall and north of the Yellow River. And in the near future, the People's Bank currency will cross the Great Wall to the northeast and cross the Yellow River to the Central Plains. In the future, with the development of the war situation, the People's Bank currency will also cross the Yangtze River to the south and flow to all newly liberated areas, thus gradually becoming the unified currency of the new China.
    (6) What will happen to local currencies after the issuance of the People's Bank currency?
    After the issuance of the People's Bank currency, the issuance of various local currencies will be stopped, and they will be gradually withdrawn in a planned and step-by-step manner. The method of withdrawal is to gradually withdraw them through banking business, financial collection, and trade recycling. Before the withdrawal, the local currency and the new currency will have a fixed exchange rate and continue to circulate as before. Moreover, in the old liberated areas, various local currencies can temporarily replace small change. Some people have misunderstandings after the issuance of the new currency and suspect that the original various local currencies will be invalidated like the Kuomintang's "legal tender"? Such a thing will never happen in our liberated areas! The People's Government is not only responsible for the People's Bank of China's new currency, but also for all the local currencies issued by the banks in the liberated areas in the past. When the local currencies are withdrawn in the future, they will be redeemed according to the current prescribed exchange rate until the last note is redeemed. The reason is very simple, because it is not the Kuomintang government that tries every means to exploit the people that issues these currencies, but the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party that protects the interests of the people at all times. Therefore, everyone can trust the various local currencies issued in the past in various liberated areas just like they trust the People's Bank of China's new currency, and should not disturb each other in alarm.
    (7) What about the previous creditor-debtor relationship after the issuance of the People's Bank currency?
    After the issuance of the People's Bank currency, the previous creditor-debtor relationships among the masses should be converted into the new currency at the exchange rate for settlement when they are due. If the local currency has not been withdrawn, the debtor may voluntarily repay with the new currency or the local currency. If the local currency has been withdrawn, it can only be repaid by converting it into the new currency. At any time, and no matter whether the debt is repaid with the new currency or the local currency, the creditor shall not refuse to use it. For example, if you borrowed 10,000 yuan of Ji currency before the issuance of the new currency, you can now repay it with 10,000 yuan of Ji currency or 100 yuan of the new currency, because 10,000 yuan of Ji currency and 100 yuan of the new currency can buy the same things.
    As for all the creditor-debtor relationships of the Huabei Bank, Bohai Bank, and Northwest Peasant Bank to the outside world, they will be borne by the People's Bank of China.
    (8) What is the difference between the People's Bank currency and the pseudo-gold yuan?
    Our People's Bank currency and various local currencies are completely different from the Kuomintang's "legal tender and gold yuan." The facts of the past decade have fully proved this. The purpose of the Kuomintang's paper money is to plunder the people's property and suffocate the people's property. Its circulation absolutely only represents the increase in the poverty of the people under the rule of the Jiang government and the further deterioration of their lives. The currency of our liberated areas is established on the basis of liberating the people and developing production, and is applied to the people's production and all undertakings that serve the people. It comes from the people and goes to the people, and it reflects and promotes the improvement of the people's lives. In recent times, due to the rapid victory of the war, the national liberation is not far away. Therefore, the Kuomintang's paper money has collapsed rapidly, while the currency of the liberated areas is more stable than in the past. Last year, the prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas rose by more than 1,500 times (50 times before August 19 and 30 times after August 19), while the prices in our liberated areas, from the northwest and Shandong, from North China to Central China, only rose by one to three times. It is expected to be more stable this year. Jiang Jieshi implemented the so-called "currency reform" for the purpose of implementing more drastic currency inflation and using it to more cruelly plunder the people. Therefore, the result of the implementation is not only soaring prices and popular resentment, but also accelerated economic collapse. Our issuance of new currency and completion of the currency unification work is to make our monetary system more unified and more solid, to facilitate the exchange of materials, develop production, and prosper the economy, entirely proceeding from the interests of the people. One side is victory, and the other side is failure; one side is to facilitate the development of production, and the other side is to plunder the people's wealth; one side is consolidation, and the other side is collapse. This clear contrast fully illustrates the completely different essence of the two currencies.

### 人民银行答复　有关新币发行各种问题

专栏：询问与答复

　　人民银行答复
  　有关新币发行各种问题
    新币发行后，本报接到各地读者很多询问函件，均已一一转交该行。现由该行作一系统答复，帮助各地干部了解实际情形，并请问群众进行深入解释。
    （一）为什么要发行中国人民银行券？
    过去我们各解放区由于处在敌人的分割封锁环境下，曾不得不发行分区流通的地方货币，这在保护人民财富支援战争发展生产上均获得了巨大的成绩，现在随着人民解放战争的胜利发展，各解放区已经完全巩固，而且联成了一片，各地的物资交流与贸易往来日益发展起来，在这种情况下，为了适应经济发展的需要并迎接全国胜利的新形势，发行统一的新货币已成为迫切需要的事情，如果到今天还没发行统一的新币，则不但会使各地商业往来，及各野战兵团协同作战中的供应采购工作遇到莫大的困难，而且在今后解放的许多大城市迅速肃清敌币，建立本币市场，稳定物价恢复秩序等工作中，亦将受到很大的阻碍。例如平津地区解放了，如果让七八种货币同时混合流通，比价又高低不一，市场就会很混乱，商民都会感到极大的不便。人民券发行了新区就可以只行使一种单一的货币，必要时拿一两种旧币当小票用，行使计算都很方便。
    今后我们解放区人民拿着人民券可以在解放区任何地方买东西，在各地旧币没有收回来以前，人民券和这些旧币都按固定的比价行使，这样，就可以省掉兑换的麻烦，又避免了比价变化的损失，对贸易往来经济发展都是非常有利的。
    （二）人民券和其他旧币的比价是怎样规定的？
    人民券和其他旧币的比价是根据各区的物价水平来规定的。人民券的购买力表现在各地区大体上是差不多的，由于各解放区物价水平高低不一，故人民券对各种旧币的比价也不同，但规定的根据都是一样的。根据以上的道理为了便于人民的计价行使，我们的政府已将人民券与各种旧币的比价固定为：
    人民券一元等于冀南币、北海币、华中币一百元。
    人民券一元等于晋察冀边币、东北流通券、长城流通券、热河流通券一千元。
    人民券一元等于西农币二千元。
    人民券一元等于冀热辽字边币五千元。
    人民券一元等于中州币二元。
    上述比价已经固定是永远不变的。
    （三）人民券的币值为什么比各区地方币都高？
    人民券的币值比各区地方货币币值都高，理由是十余年来由于物价逐渐上涨各种货币币值太低，比方冀钞的五百元券只抵战前的五分余，实在不便计算。城市中的批发交易，点票计数，常感到很大的困难。为着适应城市大宗交易的需要，便利公私款项的收付、保管、计算、携带，故将新币币值适当提高，比冀南币、北海币、华中币提高了一百倍。现在所发行的五十元新票，虽然折合冀南币或北海币为五千元，似乎很大，但是折合抗战以前的货币，只值五角以下，在城市的大宗交易中仍嫌太小，所以人民银行规定要发行一元、五元、十元、二十元、五十元、一百元六种票面的新币。有的认为新币票面大，这是由于花地方货币习惯了，乍改新币一下转不过来。
    （四）新币的购买力比旧币高，会不会引起物价上涨？
    人民券的比价高与物价上涨，这完全不是一回事情。因为花一张十元人民券，和花一张一千元的冀钞对市场来说是一样。货币对于物价的影响是在于发行数量的多少，只要我们适当限制发行数额，就不致于引起物价上涨。由于人民解放战争的胜利，我们的货币市场迅速扩大，许多新解放区人民自动拒用国民党的纸币；解放区的货币数量不足，没有及时赶上去占领市场，因此市场交易往往发生极大的困难。但同时亦有部分地区由于大军云集，物资供应困难，也会发生物价暂时的上涨。这种暂时现象在大规模战争中是很难完全避免的，但也是决不会长久存在的。目前解放区正迅速扩大，铁路、公路交通将要全部恢复，物资调剂的面加大，特别是人民生产发展，解放区的物资日益丰富，我们的货币又有国营企业庞大物资的支持，更加重要的是我们为人民生产服务的稳重的发行政策，绝不同于蒋匪的滥发票子，所以新币币值的提高，不会引起物价上涨。
    （五）人民券的腿有多长？
    人民券于去年十二月一日开始发行，首先在华北、山东、西北各解放区流通，然后逐渐推及其他解放区，现在各种地方货币都可以照样流通，为了使得市场上的票子种类不要太复杂，所以除了东北流通券和冀钞可在平津区流通，冀钞边币和西农币在华北、西北统一流通，冀钞边币和北海币在华北、华东统一流通以外，各解放区的票子虽然互相连系起来都有了固定的比价，免避了比价变化的影响，但它们之间是互不流通的，只有人民票，现在长城以南，黄河以北的广大地区内流通，并且在不久的将来，人民券就要北过长城流至关外，南过黄河流向中原了。今后随着战争形势的发展，人民券也要南渡长江，流到一切新解放的地区，因而逐渐成为新中国的统一的货币。
    （六）人民券发行后，地方货币怎么办？
    人民券发行之后，各种地方货币即停止发行，并有计划有步骤的逐渐收回，收回的方法是通过银行业务，财政征收，贸易回笼等陆续收回。在未收回之前，地方货币与新币固定比价，照旧流通，而且在老解放区，各种地方货币可以暂时代替小票。有些人在新币发行后发生误会，怀疑原有的各种地方货币，是否会象国民党的“法币”一样停兑作废？我们解放区决不会有这样的事情！人民政府不但对人民银行新币负责，而且对一切解放区银行过去发行的地方货币都要负责。将来收回地方货币的时候，一定按照现在所规定的比价收兑，兑到最后一张为止。原因非常简单，因为发行这些货币的不是千方百计剥削人民的国民党政府，而是时时刻刻保护人民利益的共产党领导下的人民政府。所以大家可象信任人民银行新币一样，信任各解放区过去所发行的各种地方货币，切勿自相惊扰。
    （七）人民券发行后，以前的债权债务关系怎样？
    人民券发行后，群众中间以前的债权债务，到期时都应按比价折成新币进行清理，如地方货币尚未收回，债务人根据自愿以新币或地方货币清偿，如地方货币已收回则只能折成新币偿付，无论在什么时候，也无论以新币或地方货币偿付债务，债权人均不得拒用，例如在新币发行前，借了一万元冀币的债，现在还一万元冀钞或者新币一百元都行，因为一万冀钞和一百元新币能买到的东西是一样的。
    至于华北银行，北海银行，西北农民银行对外的一切债权债务，则均由中国人民银行负责承受。
    （八）人民券与伪金圆券的区别在那里？
    我们的人民券和各种地方货币与国民党的“法币、金圆券”是截然不同的，十年来的事实已经充分证明。国民党纸币的目的是在掠夺人民财产，窒息人民财产，他的流通绝对的只是表示蒋政府统治下人民穷困的增加，生活的更恶化。我们解放区的货币是在解放人民和发展生产基础上建立的，又是应用在人民生产和一切为人民服务的事业上的，是从人民中来，又到人民中去，它反映并促进人民生活的改善。最近一个时期由于战争迅速胜利，全国解放已经为期不远，因此国民党纸币迅速崩溃，而解放区的货币则较过去更为稳定，去年一年国民党统治区物价上涨了一千五百余倍（八一九前上涨了五十倍，八一九后上涨了三十倍），而我解放区的物价，从西北和山东，从华北到华中，均仅上涨一倍到三倍，预料今年将更平稳。蒋匪实行所谓“币制改革”，目的是在实行更剧烈的通货膨涨，并以此来更残酷的掠夺人民，所以实行的结果，不但物价飞涨，民怨沸腾，而且更加速了经济崩溃。我们的发行新币，完成货币统一工作，是为了使我们的货币制度更单一和更巩固，是为了便利于物资交流，发展生产，繁荣经济，完全是从人民利益出发的。这一边是胜利，那一边是失败；这一边是为了便利发展生产，那一边是为了掠夺人民财富；这一边是巩固，那一边是崩溃。这个鲜明的对照，就充分地说明了两种货币完全不同的本质。
