Inquiries and Answers

　　Editor:
　　I joined the army in 1939. Later, my first wife died, leaving behind a son and a daughter. In the spring of 1942, I married a village women's director. After I returned to the army, she did not take care of my first two children for several years. After she had her own children, the abuse of the former became even more serious. She is from a rich peasant background and was expelled from the Party during the land reform last year. In her letters, she expressed great dissatisfaction with the Party and the government. How should we get along politically in the future? Assuming her Party membership can never be restored, is there grounds for divorce?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Han Ruo, December 10th

　　Answer: Your current wife's neglect of your first wife's two children can be addressed by writing to her to persuade her, and also writing to the village government to ask them to offer more advice. Once she understands the situation, she will naturally pay attention to taking care of the children. As for her being from a rich peasant background and being expelled from the Party, as long as she is not engaging in counter-revolutionary political activities, it cannot be considered grounds for divorce.

　　停止党籍不是离婚条件
    编辑同志：
    我一九三九年参军，后来前妻病故，丢下男女孩各一，一九四二年春天与一村妇会主任结婚。我返回部队后数年中他对前两个小孩不予照顾，自有了亲生小孩，对前者的虐待更变本加厉。她是富农成份，去年土改时被停止了党籍，来信谈及她对党对政府很不满，今后在政治上如何相处呢？假设她的党籍永远不能恢复了，是否有与她离婚的条件？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　韩若十二月十日
    答：你现在的妻不照顾你前妻的两个小孩，可以一面给她去信劝解她，一面给村政府写信，请他们多多劝告，思想弄通了，自然会注意照顾小孩。至于她是富农成份，被停止了党籍，只要她不是在政治上活动反革命，不能算为离婚条件。
