　　The Moon
    Most people always think that the moon is a place of beautiful scenery, with singing birds and fragrant flowers, but in fact, the moon is just a cold, large rock ball. It is a part separated from the earth. It does not emit light itself. Its light is the light of the sun shining on it and reflecting the light.
    The moon is sometimes bright and sometimes not, sometimes round, sometimes crescent. There are two reasons for this: (1) The moon itself has no light; the light comes from the sun, so the side facing away from the sun is dark, and the side facing the sun is bright. (2) The moon is constantly rotating, its direction is from west to east, revolving around the earth once every twenty-nine and a half days. In this way, its position is constantly changing, and the angle with the earth is also different. The sunlight it reflects to the earth is also different, so we sometimes see a full moon, sometimes a sickle. There is no water or air on it, so there are no people inside. It is a desolate and dead place. The side facing the sun is very hot, hotter than boiling water in a pot, and the side facing away from the sun is very cold.
    The moon is a dark object that can only reflect sunlight. As the earth revolves around the sun, the moon also revolves around the earth. If the moon is in the middle of the earth and the sun, and the bright side illuminated by the sunlight is facing away from us, we can only see its dark side. At this time, it is not visible at all, which is what astronomers call the "new moon" or "朔" (shuò). A week later, we see half of its bright part and half of its dark part, which is called "first quarter." Another week later, the earth is in the middle of the sun and the moon, and the entire lunar surface facing us is exposed to sunlight, which is called "full moon" or "望" (wàng). Seven days later, we can only see half of its bright part and half of its dark part again, which is called "last quarter."
    The moon revolves around the earth once, which is called "revolution," and takes twenty-seven days and seven hours. However, because the earth also revolves around the sun at the same time, the interval from this new moon to the second new moon is twenty-seven and a half days. The lunar calendar uses the moon's revolution around the earth as a month and the earth's revolution around the sun as a year. There must be a new moon (朔) and a full moon (望) every month, and two quarters, upper and lower. The time of one 朔 and 望 is 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.8 seconds, so the large and small months alternate, with large months of 30 days and small months of 29 days. In a regular year of twelve months, there are six large months and six small months, totaling 354 days. However, it takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45.5 seconds for the earth to revolve around the sun once. The difference between the two is more than eleven days. The way to remedy this is to add a leap month. There are three leap months in every eight years of the lunar calendar.

### 地球的卫星　月亮

　　地球的卫星
  　月亮
    一般人总以为月亮是一处山明水秀，鸟语花香的地方，但事实上月亮不过是个冰冷的大石球，它是地球分出的一部分，本身并不发光，它的光是太阳的光照到它身上，反映出光来的。
    月亮有时亮有时不亮，有时圆，有时弯，这有两个原因：（一）月亮的本身没有光，光是从太阳那里来的，所以背着太阳是黑的，向着太阳是亮的。（二）月亮是一刻不停的在转，它的方向是由西向东，二十九天半绕过地球一转子，这样，它的位置就不断的变动，与地球的角度也有差别，它反照太阳的光到地球上就也不一样，所以我们有时看到满月，有时看象个镰刀。它上面没有水、气，所以里面也没有人，冷清清的是个死地方，朝太阳的一面非常热，比锅里开水还热，背着太阳的一面非常冷。
    月亮是一个黑暗的物体，只能反照太阳的光，当地球围绕太阳旋转的时候，月亮也绕着地球旋转。如果月亮正在地球与太阳的中间，把那被日光照耀着的光明面，正背着我们，所以只能看到它的黑暗面，这时候是完全不显露的，就是天文学家所谓的“新月”或者“朔”。在一星期后，我们看见它光明的部分和黑暗的部分各一半，这时叫做“上弦”。再过一星期，地球在太阳和月亮的中间，向着我们的月面全部受到太阳光，这时叫做“满月”或者“望”。再过七天，我们又只能看见它光明的部分和黑暗的部分各一半，这时叫做“下弦”。
    月亮围绕地球旋转一周，这叫做“公转”，需时二十七日零七小时，但因同时地球也围绕太阳旋转，故从这个新月到第二个新月，相隔二十七日半。阴历就是以月亮围绕地球一周来当作一个月，以地球围绕太阳一周来当作一年的。每月必有一次新月（朔），一次满月（望），和上下两弦。一次朔望的时间，计二十九日十二时四十四分二秒八，所以大小月相间，大月三十日，小月二十九日。平年十二月，六个月大，六个月小，计三百五十四日。不过，地球围绕太阳一周，共需时三百六十五日五时四十八分四十五秒半。两相比较相差十一日之多，补救的办法，就是添加闰月，阴历八年中间有三个闰月。
