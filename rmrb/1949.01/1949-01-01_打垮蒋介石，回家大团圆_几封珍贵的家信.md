　　Defeat Chiang Kai-shek, Reunion at Home
  　Precious Family Letters
  　Sixth Column, Sixteenth Brigade, Yang Xingzhang
    Xingzhang, my son:
    I haven't received a letter since July! Your mother is very worried. Is my son healthy lately? Is your work going smoothly?
    The New Year is here. Your mother sees the army living in the village, slaughtering pigs and sheep, making a lively scene, everyone is happy, and your mother thinks of you. I imagine your team is also lively, and your mother is very happy.
    Our family's public grain quota is more than twelve portions this year. The village is calling for "quick payment". Xingzhang, what do you think your mother should do? Don't worry, your mother bustled about and paid it all off at once, becoming a model! Our family was originally a poor peasant. We didn't have a house or land before, and we couldn't even get a share to pay public grain! Since the Communist Party came, they gave us 1.7 acres of irrigated land and 3.5 acres of upland. There are only two people in the family, enough to cultivate. After you joined the army, there was a lack of labor, so the village assigned preferential labor. Thirteen and a half workdays were assigned for the wheat harvest and fourteen for the autumn harvest. Your younger brother Ruizhang and I also worked hard, and the crops were managed. The Communist Party liberated us, and we can't be ungrateful. When eating rice, don't forget the rice grower, we can't forget our roots! Paying public grain is our family's duty. Even if we don't eat ourselves, we must give priority to the state!
    The work team in our village said: Now our army is surrounding Beiping and Tianjin, and the day to eliminate Fu Zuoyi is not far off. My son, where are you now? Did you participate in the battle of Zhangjiakou? You should strive to kill the enemy and fight bravely in the team! It would be great to capture Chiang Kai-shek and then come back to see your mother! The work team leader said that Chiang Kai-shek can be overthrown in about a year. That's wonderful. Chiang Kai-shek is the root of all disasters for us poor people. If we eliminate him, we can live a peaceful life, and our mother and son can be reunited!
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Your mother, Yang (Lizhuang, Pingshan)
    Zhang Bingshuan
    My son Bingshuan: Your last letter was received. I hope you don't worry about family matters. It's getting cold, so take good care of your health. You asked about the land reform situation in our village in your letter. Generally, it's going smoothly, with an average of more than 4.2 acres of land distributed each day. Our family is a middle peasant, so the house and land remain untouched, but we didn't get any share of the fruits of the struggle. Your younger brother is studying in elementary school. His education level is too low, but the principal said, "As long as he works hard, he will be fine." Everyone at home is still healthy. I hope you kill more enemies and make great contributions in the army.
    Best wishes! 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Father, Zhang Heixiao
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Niushan Village, Second District, Huolu County)
    Feng Xixiang
    Uncle Xixiang:
    Since you joined the army, everything at home has been very good. The village cadres are very concerned about our family. Please don't worry. I hope you win more battles in the front lines, stay healthy, and fight bravely. When Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, the pig in our backyard will definitely grow fat and big, waiting for you to come back and eat it!
    Best wishes! 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Nephew, Feng Lingchen
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Beihujiazhuang, Second District, Huolu County)
    Tian Zhiying, First Column of the Central Plains Field Army
    Zhiying, my son:
    I received a letter from you in May this year, and I know you are doing well outside. Everyone at home is very happy. The New Year is here, and I think I will receive your letter soon. Last spring, our village had land reform, and our family was given six acres of good land in the southwest. Later, our village elected me as the civil affairs commissioner. Your brother is taller than when you left, and he does some of the work. I often work in the village office. Your sister has given birth to another nephew. He is only two months old, fair and chubby, and very lovable! Your mother and I, despite our age, are still very healthy, so you don't need to worry. Follow General Liu Bocheng and fight well outside! When will you cross the Yangtze River? Please send me a letter, I am looking forward to it every day!

　　打垮蒋介石，回家大团圆
  　几封珍贵的家信
  　六纵十六旅　杨兴章兴章儿：
    自七月间接到你的信以后，再没见信了！娘心中很是惦念，我儿近来身体健康吧？工作顺利吧？
    过新年了，娘看见村里住的军队，杀猪宰羊，闹得红火，个个人高高兴兴的，娘便想起你了；料想你们队上，也总是热热闹闹的，娘心里挺高兴。
    咱家的公粮，今年派了十二分多，村里号召“快缴”，兴章儿，你想娘怎么办？放心吧，娘扑闹扑闹，一下交清了，当了个模范！咱家本是贫雇农，先前没房没地，想出公粮也造不上分！自从来了共产党，给咱分了一亩七分水浇地，三亩半岗地，家里只有两口人，足够种了，你参军以后，缺少劳动力，村里便给派优待工，麦夏派了十三个半，收秋派了十四个，我和你瑞章弟弟，再刨动刨动，庄稼也就奈何了。共产党解放了咱，咱不能没良心。吃米忘不了种谷人，咱不能忘本呀！交公粮是咱家的任务，那怕自家不吃，也得先尽国家！
    咱村里工作组说：现在咱们军队正包围着北平天津，消灭傅作义的日子不远了。我儿：你现在什么地方？打张家口你参加了没有？你在队上应当努力杀敌，勇敢作战！捉住了蒋介石，再回来见娘多好呀！听工作组长说：再有一年左右就能打倒蒋介石，真好极了，蒋介石是咱们穷人的大祸根，灭了他，咱们就能过安生日子，咱们母子也就能团圆了！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　你的娘杨氏（平山里庄）
    张兵拴
    兵拴吾儿：上次来信收到，望儿不必挂念家事。天冷了，要好好注意身体。来信问咱村土地改革情况，大体上还顺当，每天平均有四亩二分多地。咱家是个中农，房、地照旧没动；但斗争果实，也没分到。你弟弟在完小念书，文化程度太低，校长说：“只要努力就行。”家里的人，都还健壮。希望你在部队上多多杀敌立大功。
    祝你好！　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　父张黑小
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（获鹿县第二区牛山村）
    冯喜祥喜祥叔叔：
    自从你参军以后，家中非常好。村干部对咱家很关心，请你不要挂念。希望你在前方多打胜仗，身体健康，战斗勇敢。等打垮了蒋介石，咱家后园的猪，一定长得又肥又大，等你回来吃呢！
    祝你好！　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　侄冯令辰
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（获鹿县二区北胡家庄）
    中原野战一纵　田志英志英儿：
    今年五月里接到了你一封信，知道你在外边很好，家里人都很喜欢。新年到了，我想又快接到你的信啦。去年春天里咱村土地改革，分给了咱家西南六亩好地，后来咱村里又选我当民政委员。你兄弟比你走的时候长高了，有些活都是他去做，我常在村公所里办公。你姐姐，又添了个外甥，才两月，又白又胖，怪喜人！我和你娘，别看年纪大了，身体都还很壮实，你不用挂念。你跟着刘伯承将军好好的在外面作战吧！你们什么时候过大江？可要给我来个信，我整天盼着哩！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　父田保祥
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（获鹿东焦村）
