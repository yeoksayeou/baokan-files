Shijiazhuang Business Community Holds Symposium
　　Industrial and Commercial Development Should Be Planned

[Shijiazhuang News] On January 3rd, the second New Year after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce convened a symposium in the city government meeting room with more than 100 representatives from public and private enterprises and cooperatives in the city. The purpose was to solicit opinions on the government's work over the past year and how to improve it in the future. Director Lu Yifu extended New Year greetings to all representatives on behalf of the government. Amid warm applause, Director Lu said with a reminiscent tone: Last New Year, Shijiazhuang was still very chaotic. The business community did not understand the Communist Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce and had many concerns in their minds. After repeated publicity and factual proof, everyone gradually began to operate freely. From January to mid-October last year, the number of private shops in the city increased from 1,562 to 2,136, and the number of private factories increased from 705 to 1,496. Commerce increased by 36.7 percent, and industry increased by 112.2 percent (according to the announcement at that time, the increase in commerce was 92.55 percent and the increase in industry was 35.96 percent, which was incorrect). The rapid development of industry in particular shows that Shijiazhuang is moving towards the construction of New Democracy. Director Lu also called on everyone to study the New Year's message of the Xinhua News Agency editorial: "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." The meeting lasted for more than three hours. At the meeting, small factories requested more assistance. Regarding the relationship between public and private enterprises, both parties requested further cooperation in promoting finished products and supplying raw materials. The Zhang Zanting Towel Thread Cooperative hoped that under the public supply of raw materials, there would be no shortage of foreign yarn, and that finished products could be sold smoothly in the off-season. The Dasheng Cotton Weaving Factory suggested organizing a cotton cloth market. The Xinhua Tobacco Company believes that there are currently too many cigarette factories operated by municipal agencies and private enterprises, resulting in overproduction. It is hoped that this part of the funds can be transferred in a planned way to production that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Manager Li of the Trading Company suggested that all industrial and commercial enterprises should, within the organization of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, study how to develop industry and commerce in a planned way: First, determine which industries are needed for the national economy and the people's livelihood. Second, which industries and businesses have a future. Third, the problems in this industry. Finally, Director Lu sincerely thanked all representatives for their opinions and stated that these opinions would be used as a reference for formulating this year's work plan.

　　石市工商界举行座谈
  　发展工商业应该有计划
    【石家庄讯】石家庄解放后的第二个新年——元月三日，工商局召集全市公营私营企业及合作社代表百余人，在市府会议室举行座谈会征求对一年来政府工作及今后如何改进等意见，鹿毅夫局长代表政府向全体代表拜年。在热烈的掌声中鹿局长带着回忆的口吻说：去年新年石家庄还很混乱，工商界不了解共产党保护工商业的政策，思想上有很多顾虑，经过多次宣传和事实证明，大家才渐渐地放手经营，从去年一月到十月半全市私营商店由一千五百六十二户增到二千一百三十六户，私营工厂由七百零五户增加到一千四百九十六户，商业增加了百分之三十六点七，工业增加了百分之一百十二点二（按当时宣布商业增加百分之九十二点五五、工业增加百分之三十五点九六不对）。特别是工业发展之快，说明石家庄正在向着建设新民主主义的路上前进。鹿局长并号召大家学习新华社社论：一九四九年新年献词——“将革命进行到底”。会议进行了三个多小时，会上，小型工厂要求多加帮助。在公私营企业关系上，双方都要求在推销成品供应原料上能更进一步合作。张赞廷毛巾合线合作社希望在公家供应原料下能经常不缺洋纱，在淡月成品也能顺利推销，大生棉织厂建议组织棉布市场。新华烟草公司认为：目前全市机关经营的及私营的烟厂太多，生产过剩，希望将这部分资金有计划的转移到有益国民生计的生产上去。贸易公司李经理建议：全市工商业在工商联合会的组织内，应该有计划地研究如何发展工商业：第一，确定哪一种工业是国计民生需要的。第二，哪一些工商业是有前途的。第三，本行业中的问题。最后鹿局长向全体代表挚诚的提供意见表示感谢，并声明将以这些意见作为订制本年度工作计划的参考。
