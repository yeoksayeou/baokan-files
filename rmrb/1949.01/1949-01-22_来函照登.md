　　Letters to the Editor

　　To the Comrades of the People's Daily Editorial Department:
    In the news item "Party Organizations in Some Areas of Southern Hebei Neglect Impure Elements within the Party, and Leadership is Sloppy in Rectifying the Party. The Regional Party Committee and Prefectural Party Committee Have Paid Attention to Correction" on the second page of the Party newspaper on December 22nd (Issue 189), there is a sentence that says "Zhentang County proposed 'resolving party issues within the party' because they were afraid of openly rectifying the party." We don't know where this issue comes from? We have checked the county committee's resolutions several times, and there is no such resolution, not even a mention of it. We once discovered that during the party rectification work in Pingtoulou, Fourth District, when discussing the issue of withdrawing over-occupied fruits within the branch, a cadre from the work team (newly promoted) proposed "resolving party issues within the party" at the branch meeting to accommodate the backward request of party members who were unwilling to return the fruits. The work team leader discovered this and immediately corrected it. Afterwards, the matter was reported to the county committee. The county committee, based on the prevailing right-leaning tendencies in the thinking of cadres at the time, cited this incident and criticized it. We estimate that Comrade Su Youmin, who reported this news, learned about it from the prefectural committee. The reason for the discrepancy with the facts may be that we did not explain the matter clearly when we reported it to the prefectural committee by telephone. Another possibility is that the comrade who answered or recorded the phone call at the prefectural committee may have misheard or misrecorded it. We sincerely hope for a correction.

　　　　　Sincerely,
    Bu Li
    　　　Zhentang County Committee

    To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:
    The headline of the news about Yangquan workers joining the army published on the first page of the People's Daily on December 27th was "Two Hundred Yangquan Miners Join the Army." Among the two hundred workers who joined the army in our city this time, in addition to miners, there are also workers from iron smelters, transportation, and other industries. Therefore, the word "miners" should be changed to "workers." Please correct it.

　　来函照登人民日报编辑部同志：
    党报在十二月廿二日（一八九期）第二版“冀南部分地区忽视党内不纯，领导整党马虎了事，区党委、地委已注意纠正”一消息中，内有“振堂县因害怕公开整党而提出‘党内问题党内解决’”一语，这个问题不知从何而来？我们检查了县委若干次的决议中，并未有该项决议，就连提过也没有。我们曾经发现过在四区平头楼整党工作中，在支部内讨论退出多占果实问题时，有工作组一个干部（新提拔出来的）在支部会上提出“党内问题党内解决”以迁就党员不愿退出果实的落后请求，该工作组组长发觉后，随时即指正了，事后汇报县委，县委根据当时普遍在干部思想上存在的右的偏向，曾列举此事，作了批判。我们估计：报导此项消息的苏幼民同志，系从地委了解的，与事实不符的原因，一是可能我们电话旬报时，例举该事未说清楚。一是地委接电话的同志或记录的同志，可能听错记错，谨希给予更正。
    　　　　　此致
    布礼

    　　　　　十二月二十七日人民日报社编辑部：
    在人民日报十二月二十七日第二版头条登载的阳泉工人参军消息，标题为“阳泉矿工二百参军”按本市此次参军的二百工人当中，除矿工外还有其他铁炉运输等工人在内，故“矿工”二字应改为“工人”，请予更正。
