Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. Student representative conferences are currently being convened or prepared in the Central Plain, Northeast, and North China liberated areas, respectively, in order to formally establish student federations in each region and send representatives to attend the forthcoming Chinese Liberated Areas Student Representative Conference. The Student Representative Conference of the Central Plain Liberated Area was held in Kaifeng on the 10th of this month, with a scheduled duration of ten days. In addition to adopting the organizational charter of the Central Plain Liberated Area Student Federation and formally establishing the Central Plain Student Federation, the conference has also selected Li Gangling of Central Plain University and Liu Guanghua of the Kaifeng City Student Federation to participate in the preparatory work for the Chinese Liberated Areas Student Federation. The student associations and student federations of universities and middle schools in the northeastern provinces and cities jointly issued a notice a few days ago, deciding to hold the Northeast Liberated Area Student Representative Conference in Shenyang on the 26th of this month to formally establish the Northeast Liberated Area Student Federation. The notice pointed out: "After the liberation of the entire Northeast, the students in the Northeast are completely in the same big family of a new democratic society, and the conditions for realizing new democratic education in the entire Northeast are fully available. We now have the opportunity to freely study progressive science and theory, and we have the opportunity to unite and carry out activities that are beneficial to the people and to young students." The notice stipulates that each of the eight universities in the northeastern provinces and cities should send one representative to Shenyang before the 15th to participate in the preparatory work for the Student Representative Conference. The student delegations from various provinces and cities attending the conference must arrive in Shenyang before the 25th. The Preparatory Committee of the North China Liberated Area Student Federation, since its establishment on December 19th of last year, issued a notice on the 25th of the same month, deciding to convene the North China Liberated Area Student Representative Conference this month. At that time, the conference will formally establish the North China Student Federation and elect the executive organ of the Student Federation, and formulate the charter of the North China Student Federation. The notice stipulates that the election of student representatives from various parts of North China to attend the conference must be completed by the 10th of this month.
