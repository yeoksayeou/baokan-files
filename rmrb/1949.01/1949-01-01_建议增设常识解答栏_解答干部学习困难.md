　　Suggest Adding a Common Sense Q&A Column
  　Solving Cadre Learning Difficulties
    Editor:
    I encountered several problems in my studies that I cannot solve on my own. I am submitting them for consideration by relevant departments:
    (I) On the issue of cultural activities:
    With the victory of the war, cultural education has been elevated to a significant position in the construction of a New Democratic country. However, I feel that cultural activities are severely lacking in the war effort. The People's Liberation Army has grown from tens of thousands of soldiers at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War to over three million today. Moreover, it is a people's army that has grown, strengthened, and consolidated itself in war. It has developed a mature set of experiences in military construction and combat. However, it is regrettable that there is still no systematic literary work (similar to the Soviet Union's "Fear and Fearlessness," "The People Are Immortal," etc.) to depict it. I don't know if this is because our comrades working in culture have not paid enough attention to this issue (because there are already some lengthy works on the land reform issue) or because the troops themselves have not taken responsibility for this work? In the future, I believe we should send more cultural workers to live, work, and fight alongside the soldiers. In this way, after becoming familiar with the soldiers' situation, we can write good works based on the materials. Therefore, if culture is to serve the soldiers, the government must provide the cultural institutions with this expenditure, and the cultural institutions must also specifically send cadres to the troops. This is not something that can be accomplished by simply relying on war correspondents to write short battle dispatches.
    Secondly, transforming old culture is also a very important issue. Currently, the majority of the masses in most places still use old feudal things for entertainment. I have seen in the newspaper that some people seem to be working hard on this.
    (II) Regarding common sense in social sciences and natural sciences, some publications (such as "Youth and Children," "New Masses," "North China Culture," etc.) used to publish articles, but this issue has not been resolved after unified publication. Therefore, could you open such a column to help cadres in their jobs solve some of the difficult problems they encounter in self-study? This is my personal suggestion and I think it will be welcomed by many readers.

Su Tian, Comrade:
    (I) Regarding the issue of culture serving the soldiers, we hope that it will attract the attention of relevant authorities and that opinions will be put forward to start a discussion.
    (II) Our newspaper has already opened a "Reading Dictionary" column, which regularly explains common sense questions in social sciences. At the same time, the "Study and Discussion" and "Questions and Answers" columns also welcome everyone to write in with questions from all aspects and participate in the discussion. Regarding natural sciences, due to limited manpower, we do not plan to open a special column in the near future. However, if you have any questions in this regard, you can also write to us and we will forward them to experts for answers.

### 建议增设常识解答栏　解答干部学习困难

　　建议增设常识解答栏
  　解答干部学习困难
    编辑同志：
    我在学习中想到几个问题，自己解决不了，特提出供有关部门考虑：
    （一）关于文化活动问题：
    文化教育，随着战争的胜利，在新民主主义国家建设上，已提到相当的位置。但我总觉得文化活动在战争方面非常不够。解放军由抗日开始时的数万人，到现在发展至三百余万；而且，它是在战争中生长壮大与巩固起来的一支人民军队，在建军及战斗上，已经有了一套成熟的经验，可是遗憾得很，到现在却没有一本有系统的文艺作品（类似苏联的“恐惧与无畏”，“人民是不朽的”等）将它描写出来。我不知这是因为这个问题未被我们作文化工作的同志重视呢？（因关于土改问题已有一些长篇著作）或是部队本身对这一工作未负起责任？今后我以为应该多派些文化工作者和战士一起生活、工作与战斗。这样，熟习了战士们的情况，然后才能根据材料写出好的作品。因此，文化如为兵服务的话，便要政府给文化机关这笔开支，文化机关也必须专门派出干部到部队中去，这便不是单靠随军记者写一点简短战斗通讯就算完成任务了。
    其次，改造旧文化也是一个很重要的问题，现在大多数地方的群众还是用旧的封建的东西来娱乐。这一点，在报上倒看到似有人在努力了。
    （二）关于社会科学及自然科学的常识，过去曾有一些刊物（如“青年与儿童”、“新大众”、“华北文化”等）刊载，但统一出版后，这个问题却没有解决。为此，你们是否可以开辟这么一栏，以供在职干部们解决一些自学中的疑难问题。这是我个人的建议，想也是许多读者所欢迎的。　　　　　　　　　苏田苏田同志：
    （一）关于文化为兵服务的问题，希望能引起有关机关的注意，并提出意见展开讨论。
    （二）本报已辟有“读报辞典”一栏，经常解释有关社会科学常识的问题。同时，“学习讨论”及“询问与答复”等栏，也欢迎大家能来信提出各方面的问题并参加讨论。关于自然科学方面；因限于人力，我们最近不拟开辟专栏；但你如有关于这方面的问题，亦可来信提出，我们当转请专家解答。　　　　编者
