Jinzhong Electric Dispatch: The Jinzhong District Party Committee, based on the urgent demands of over one million farmers in the new district, convened an enlarged cadre meeting of over 240 people on the 12th of last month to deploy land reform work in the new district. Cadres from all levels of the new district party committees and women cadres from all over Jinzhong participated. Based on the Central Land Law Outline and the instructions of the North China Bureau, and in conjunction with the characteristics of the new district in Jinzhong, the District Party Committee made clear and specific provisions for the principles, plans, steps, and schedule of land reform in the new district. On the first day of the meeting, Comrade Wu Guang of the District Party Committee gave a report, first explaining the current situation and that the vast number of farmers in the new district urgently demanded that we implement land reform in the new district without delay. Then, the Jinzhong New District Land Reform policy, as decided by the District Party Committee, was conveyed to the conference in detail, and a specific analysis was made of the difficulties and favorable conditions for implementing land reform in the new district this winter. The main difficulties were: the number of cadres in office was insufficient, and some had to undertake support-the-front tasks; the organizational foundation of the masses in the new district was poor. However, from the perspective of favorable conditions: First, this area has long been surrounded by old liberated areas, farmers demanded land, and landlords and old-style rich peasants also knew that land reform would be implemented. Second, the environment is stable. Third, many areas have had our work before, the masses have a certain degree of awareness, and based on the foundation of this autumn's grain adjustment and other work, we have gained the support of the masses, and we have also understood some situations. Fourth, we have the Central Government's complete land reform policy and the instructions of the North China Bureau and the decisions of the District Party Committee. Fifth, all localities have land reform experience. Sixth, our approach is simple, and in terms of sources of strength, in addition to the cadres within the organization, there are also a large number of village cadres from the old liberated areas with land reform experience. The new district can train and use existing activists; many intellectuals and large numbers of young students in the townships can be trained to do technical work in land reform. In terms of time, there are still two and a half months to carry out this work. The report pointed out: We should actively overcome difficulties, fully recognize the strength of the masses, and as long as our leadership is correct, does not make mistakes, and makes the policy clear so that it is accepted and mastered by the masses, the strength of the masses cannot be calculated in numbers. Of course, emphasizing spontaneity and abandoning leadership is clearly wrong. Since we have mastered the subjective and objective conditions, have sources of strength, have the Central Government's complete policy and the leadership of the District Party Committee; we should have enough confidence to complete the task of land reform in the Jinzhong New District separately and step by step. From the second to the sixth day of the conference, separate discussions were held. The vast majority of cadres recognized the requirements of the situation; analyzed the needs of the masses; increased their sense of responsibility; found ways to overcome difficulties; overcame the view that there were too few cadres and too many tasks to complete; and, according to the decision of the District Party Committee, studied new working methods and increased confidence. On the eighth day of the conference, a special report was made on mobilizing women and youth to participate in the land reform movement. On December 19th, the District Party Committee made detailed and clear conclusions on the three parts that were found to need further clarification in the discussion: popular elections, mobilizing the masses, and building the Party. The meeting then concluded.

　　主客观条件大体具备
  　晋中布置新区土改
    对发动妇女青年都有专题报告
    【晋中电】晋中区党委根据新区百万余农民的迫切要求，特在上月十二日，召集了二百四十余人的扩大干部会议，布置新区土地改革工作。有新区各级党委同全晋中妇女干部参加。区党委依据中央土地法大纲及华北局指示，结合晋中新区特点，对新区土改方针、计划、步骤、日程均作了明确具体的规定。会议第一天为区党委武光同志作报告，首先说明了目前形势及新区广大农民都迫切要求我们刻不容缓的在新区实行土地改革；接着将区党委决定的晋中新区土改方针，向大会详细传达，并对今冬在新区实行土改的困难与有利条件，做了具体的分析。困难的方面主要是：在职干部的数量不足，且有一部分去担负支前任务，新区群众的组织基础差。但从有利条件方面来看：一、这个地方长期被老解放区所包围，农民要求土地，地主与旧式富农也知道要实行土地改革。二、环境稳定。三、不少地区有过我们的工作，群众有一定的觉悟，加上今秋调剂青苗等工作的基础，取得了群众拥护，我们也了解了一些情况。四、有了中央完备的土地改革政策与华北局指示及区党委的决定。五、各地都有土地改革的经验。六、我们的做法简便，在力量来源上，除编制内部的干部外，尚有老区大批有土地改革经验的村干部。新区可将已有的积极分子，经过训练去使用；有很多在乡知识分子及大批青年学生，经过训练，可做土地改革中的技术工作。在时间上还有两个半月能进行这一工作。报告中指出：我们应主动积极的去克服困难，充分认识到群众的力量，只要我们领导正确，不犯错误，把政策交代明白，使政策为群众所接受掌握，群众的力量是不能以数目字计算的。当然，强调自发论，放弃领导，显然是错误的。既然我们掌握了主、客观条件，有力量的来源，有中央完备的政策和区党委的领导；我们就应有足够的信心，有分别、有步骤地完成晋中新区土地改革的任务。大会第二天到第六天进行分别讨论。绝大部分干部认清了形势的要求；分析了群众的需要；增加了责任感；找出克服困难的方法；克服了认为干部少任务重完不成任务的观点；根据区党委的决定，研究了新的工作方法，增加了信心。大会第八天，关于发动妇女、青年参加土地改革运动作了专题报告。十二月十九日区党委对讨论中发现需要进一步明确解释的民选、发动群众、建设党等三个部分，作了详细明确的结论。会议遂结束。
