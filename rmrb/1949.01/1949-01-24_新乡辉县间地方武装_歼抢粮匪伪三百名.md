【Taihang Telegram】A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Henan-North front, in coordination with a portion of the Huixian local armed forces, ambushed the Chiang bandit 40th Army's 317th and 115th Regiments, who were returning to Xinxiang from Huixian after looting grain, on the Xinxiang-Huixian highway between Mengfen and Ligu on the afternoon of the 13th. The enemy fled in disarray. On the 14th at noon, our army launched an attack on the enemy stronghold at Mengzhuang City, southeast of the highway, and captured the area around 1 p.m., completely annihilating the defending enemy, the Xiafeng Township Public Office and the 5th and 8th Companies of the puppet Huixian Security Regiment. In this battle, a total of eight enemies were killed or wounded, and 191 enemies, including the township heads Zhao Xunshan and Wei Youzhi, were captured. Three light machine guns, 118 rifles and pistols, one grenade launcher, and nearly 10,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.

【Taihang Telegram】The local armed forces in Henan-North are actively attacking bandit troops from Xinxiang and Huixian looting grain, and have achieved continuous victories. On the 8th of this month, the enemy's 115th Regiment and 2nd Replenishment Regiment of the 40th Army were returning to the city from Yanglvchuan area in northeast Huixian after looting grain. On the way, they were ambushed by the Huixian Independent Regiment, combined with the local work team, pre-positioned between Houlang Village and Zhang Village. After half an hour of combat, the majority of the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the enemy's 115th Regiment was annihilated, and seven light machine guns were seized. We suffered only one casualty and one wounded. On the 11th, our 5th Military Sub-district's local corps ambushed the bandit Wang Sanzhu's unit of more than 40 people and their grain looting transport team at Dongtun and Xiaoyangcao in southern Jixian, eliminating most of them, liberating more than 100 civilians, intercepting 50 carts, 50,000 jin of grain, and more than 200 jin of cotton. We suffered no casualties. In the above battles, a total of 38 enemies, including a company commander (from the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 115th Regiment), were killed or wounded, and 62 enemies, including platoon leaders, were captured. Seven light machine guns, 30 rifles and pistols, one submachine gun, and more than 3,160 rounds of ammunition were seized. The intercepted carts, grain, cotton, and dozens of livestock have all been handed over to the local democratic government for disposal.
