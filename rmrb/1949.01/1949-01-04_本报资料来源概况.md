Since its inception, this newspaper has been grateful to receive a constant stream of materials from Party, government, military, and civilian sectors, including various organizational publications, work correspondence, circulars, work summaries, and reports. This has enabled the newspaper to obtain information from multiple sources, providing much convenience for editing and interviewing, and enriching the newspaper's content. We hereby express our gratitude. We hope to continue receiving these materials regularly in the future and to further establish close ties with this newspaper. The general situation of the materials received by the newspaper's data room in the past six months is now announced as follows:
