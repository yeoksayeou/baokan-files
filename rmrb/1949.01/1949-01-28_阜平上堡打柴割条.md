    [North Yue News] Chen Zhanyi, a labor hero from Shangbao Village, Fifth District of Fuping, began going up the mountains to cut *zhaizi* (young strips used for weaving baskets) after the autumn harvest last year. In less than twenty days, he earned 800 yuan (new currency, same below), and also chopped more than 4,000 catties of firewood. Under his influence, Wu Shuange and Zhou Zhengde also went to cut *zhaizi* and carried them to sell in other counties, earning more than 2,000 yuan in twenty days. Currently, seventy households in the village have cut enough firewood for the coming year. Carpenter Chen Yu and five others, with two apprentices, repaired houses and farm tools, earning 1,100 catties of millet in fifteen days. This village of about a hundred households is engaged in production such as felting, iron stoves, basket weaving, mat weaving, spinning, and transportation. From the end of the autumn harvest to the middle of last month, the total sideline income of the village has reached more than 16,000 yuan. Production is continuing to develop.

　　阜平上堡打柴割条
    【北岳讯】阜平五区上堡村劳动英雄陈占义在去年秋收后，即开始上山打寨子（编筐系用的幼条）。不到二十天即赚洋八百元（新币下同），还打柴四千余斤。在他的影响下，吴拴歌、周郑德也去打寨子，并驮往外县去卖，二十天中得洋二千余元。现该村有七十户人家已打够明年一年的烧柴。木匠陈玉等六人带徒弟两个修理房舍、农具，十五天中挣小米一千一百斤。这百来户的村子，进行赶毡、铁炉、编筐、席、纺线、运输等生产，自秋收完毕至上月中旬，全村副业收入已达一万六千余元。现生产正继续发展着。
