　　Jin-Sui Cultivates Women Cadres
  　Over One Hundred Women Elected as Village Representatives in Pianguan's Third District
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 6th] Several areas in the Jin-Sui region have begun to emphasize the cultivation of women cadres. In the recent reorganization of village governments in Pianguan County's Third District, 101 women were elected as village representatives, accounting for 24% of all village representatives. Among them, 19 participated in village government committees, accounting for 20% of the total number of village government committee members. This is a result of the district's attention to mobilizing women to participate in land reform, production, supporting the front lines, and party rectification movements, thereby improving women's abilities and status. During a recent meeting of Party District Committee Secretaries in Guoxian County, the CCP County Committee reviewed women's work and found that, due to the remaining feudal ideas of valuing men over women, very few women cadres were cultivated, and there was a lack of concern for the difficulties faced by women cadres. One female cadre was working with her child, and the male comrades around her not only did not help but also suppressed her, causing her great distress. The county's leading organs are determined to correct this error and plan to cultivate 15 women district government committee members within half a year, including 5 district chairpersons, and 60 to 90 women village government committee members, including 30 village government chairpersons. It was also decided that male cadres should first mobilize the women in their own families to participate in various tasks, and then unite the broad masses of women to participate in work.

　　晋绥培养妇女干部
  　偏关三区百余妇女当选村代表
    【新华社兴县六日电】晋绥若干地区已开始重视培养妇女干部。偏关县三区最近整顿村政府中，有一百零一个妇女当选为村代表，占全部村代表的百分之二十四。其中参加村政府委员会者十九人，占村政府委员总数的百分之二十。这是由于该区在土地改革、生产、支援前线和整党等历次运动中，注意了发动妇女参加因而提高了妇女能力和地位的结果。崞县中共县委在最近举行党的区委书记会议时检讨妇女工作，发现由于存在传统的重男轻女的封建思想残余，因而培养出妇女干部极少，对女干部困难不很关心。有一个女干部带着孩子工作，其周围男同志不予帮助反而压弃，使她非常苦恼。该县领导机关决心纠正此错误，计划在半年之内培养十五个妇女区政府委员，其中包括五个区主席，六十个至九十个妇女村政府委员，其中包括三十个村政府主席。并决定由男干部首先动员自己家里的妇女参加各种工作，进而团结广大妇女群众参加工作。
