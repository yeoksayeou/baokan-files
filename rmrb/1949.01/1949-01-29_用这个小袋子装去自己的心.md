　　Use This Small Bag to Carry Your Heart
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Personnel from the Political Department of the North China Military Region Headquarters and directly subordinate organs and troops are enthusiastically extending their regards to the combat troops on the Pingjin front, especially the Northeast People's Liberation Army brothers who have entered the pass. Everyone is thinking about how to use a memorable item to express their welcome and regards, so they are all making comfort bags. Everyone says: This thing is small, but it carries their hearts. Comrade Guo Yi of the reception center put his study notebook, which he received as a reward for meritorious service, into it; a comrade from the Guard Battalion put the silk handkerchief that his wife gave him when he joined the army into it; female comrades, despite working all day, still rushed to knit wool socks and gloves at night. The Propaganda Department's Culture and Education Brigade rushed to make many exquisite New Year cards; the little comrades from the children's school also wrote greeting letters to "Uncle Lin Biao." Within ten days, the Direct Work Section of the Military Region Political Department received 1,214 comfort bags, containing: 747 bars of soap, 492 towels, 453 toothbrushes, 322 packages of toothpaste (powder), 196 pairs of socks (thread, cloth), 11 pairs of shoes, 280 diaries, 45 pencils, 165 packs of cigarettes, 19 New Year cards, 4 porcelain bowls, 4 pairs of gloves, 1 scarf, 1 silver dollar, 75,200 Jicha banknotes, and 329 greeting letters. The comfort bags from various organs are still being sent in. (Direct Work Section of the Military Region Political Department)

　　用这个小袋子装去自己的心
    【本报讯】华北军区司令部政治部及直属各机关部队人员，热烈向平津前线作战部队，特别是入关的东北解放军弟兄部队慰问。都想如何用一件足资留念的东西来表达自己的欢迎和慰问，于是都做起了慰问袋。大家都说：这东西虽微，但它装去自己的心。招待所郭毅同志把自己立功得奖的学习本装进去；警卫营一个同志把自己参军时老婆送给的丝手绢装进去；女同志虽然工作了一整天，黑夜里还赶织毛袜和手套。宣传部的文教大队赶制了很多精美的贺年片；子弟学校的小同志也给“林彪叔叔”写了问候信。十天内，军区政治部直工科收到一千二百一十四个慰问袋，其中装了：肥（香）皂七百四十七块，毛巾四百九十二条，牙刷四百五十三把，牙粉（膏）三百二十二包，袜子（线、布）一百九十六双，鞋十一双，日记本二百八十个，铅笔四十五支，纸烟一百六十五包，贺年片十九张，洋磁碗四个，手套四双，围巾一条，银元一块，冀钞七万五千二百元，慰问信三百二十九封。现各机关的慰问袋仍在继续送来。　　　（军区政治部直工科）
