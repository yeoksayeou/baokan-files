Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 18th: Three enemy planes were destroyed on the Pingjin Front. On the 14th, during the city assault battle, the People's Liberation Army shot down two enemy planes on the Tianjin front. At 10 PM the same afternoon, an enemy "P-51" aircraft flying from Beiping to Qingdao crashed and burned in a certain area east of Beiping due to a mechanical failure. The pilot, Liang Youchuan, bailed out and landed and was captured, but has been released back to Beiping. Liang is from Nanhai, Guangdong, is 28 years old, and is an Air Force Captain and Squad Leader of the Fourth Group of the Kuomintang.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th: Kuomintang bandit planes indiscriminately bombed Jinan City. At around 1 PM on the 12th, twelve Kuomintang bandit "B-24" bombers sneaked into the skies over Jinan and indiscriminately bombed the downtown area for more than an hour, dropping more than 80 light and heavy bombs. According to preliminary investigations, 60 people were killed and 81 were injured, and more than 500 houses were destroyed. The tall building of the Jinan branch of the Hengdeli Watch Store on Jing'er Road, the most prosperous area of the city, was completely destroyed. As soon as the bombing stopped, the Jinan Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters immediately organized various agencies, troops, and public schools to rush to the disaster areas for rescue. Deputy Mayor Yao Zhongming and the directors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government went to participate in and direct the rescue efforts. Shandong Provincial Hospital also immediately suspended outpatient services to provide emergency care to the affected citizens. That evening, the Municipal Government decided to allocate 10,000 jin of grain for immediate distribution for emergency relief, and also allocated public housing to resettle homeless victims. The Kuomintang bandit planes' atrocities aroused great anger among the citizens of the city. Deputy Mayor Yao called on all staff and citizens to step up support for the front lines, thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries, and avenge the dead. The Kuomintang Air Force's bombing of Jinan shows the incorrigibility of war criminals Zhou Zhirou and Wang Shuming, the deputy commanders of the Kuomintang Air Force. All Kuomintang Air Force personnel who participated in the indiscriminate bombing of Jinan and other bombing crimes must understand that if they do not stop doing evil and atone for their crimes, they will not be able to avoid the severe punishment of the people, and this punishment will not be long in coming. The way for Kuomintang Air Force personnel to avoid suffering the same punishment as Zhou Zhirou and Wang Shuming is to learn from those who recently flew from Nanjing, Qingdao, and Hangzhou to the Liberated Areas, refuse to continue to slaughter their compatriots for the Kuomintang reactionaries, and come over to the side of the people.

　　平津前线毁敌机三架
  　匪机滥炸济南激起市民愤怒
    【新华社平津前线十八日电】平津前线敌机三架被毁。天津前线解放军十四日于攻城战斗中，击落敌机两架。同日下午十时，由北平飞往青岛的敌“Ｐ５１”式飞机一架，因机件发生故障，在北平以东某地坠落焚毁。驾驶员梁犹川跳伞着陆被俘，已被释回北平。梁系广东南海人，现年二十八岁，任国民党空军四大队上尉分队长。
    【新华社华东十八日电】国民党匪机滥炸济南市。十二日下午一时许，国民党匪机“Ｂ２４”轰炸机十二架，窜入济市上空，滥炸市中心区达一小时以上，共投轻重磅炸弹八十余枚。据初步调查，共炸死六十人，炸伤八十一人，毁房五百数十间，在全市最繁华的经二路亨得利钟表行济南分行的高大建筑全部被毁。轰炸一停，济市市政府及警备司令部立即组织各机关、部队和公立学校赶赴受灾地区进行抢救，副市长姚仲明及市府各局局长皆赶往参加及指挥。山东省立医院亦立即停止门诊，急救受害市民。当晚，市府又决定拨粮一万斤，立即分发，进行急赈，同时拨出公房安置无家可归的灾民。国民党匪机的暴行，激起了全市市民的极大愤怒。姚副市长号召全市工作人员和市民加紧支援前线，彻底消灭国民党反动派，为死难者复仇。国民党空军的轰炸济南，表示战争罪犯国民党空军总副司令周至柔、王叔铭的怙恶不悛。一切参加滥炸济南和其他轰炸罪行的国民党空军人员，必须明了他们如不停止作恶，将功赎罪，则他们将不能避免人民的严厉惩办，而这种惩办不会要好久了。国民党空军人员使自己免于随同周至柔、王叔铭遭受惩办的方法，就是学习最近由南京、青岛、杭州驾机飞往解放区的人们，拒绝继续为国民党反动政府屠杀自己的同胞，而投到人民方面来。
