To the Editor:
    I am a teacher at a normal school and have a few questions regarding our vital interests that I would like to ask you or the relevant authorities to answer:
    I. In our North China Liberated Area, are there any uniform regulations regarding the treatment of teaching staff in secondary and normal schools? What criteria are used as standards? Since living standards vary between rural and urban areas, will the treatment also differ?
    II. According to past practice, teachers and staff generally receive their salaries during the winter and summer vacations. Is this still the case? What happens to those who leave their positions midway?
    III. Female teachers naturally need to take leave during childbirth. Should there be reasonable regulations regarding the length of leave? Will they still receive their salaries during the leave?
    IV. It is said that schools can subsidize a portion of the childcare expenses after a child is born. What are the details? How does the school handle these expenses?
　　　　　Reader, Yanni

Comrade Yanni:
    Regarding the questions you raised, the North China People's Government has recently made detailed and reasonable provisions for this. The following is:

    Interim Standards for the Treatment of Teaching, Clerical, and Janitorial Staff in Middle and Normal Schools

    A. General Principles. Article 1: These interim standards are formulated and implemented to appropriately improve the living standards of school staff while taking into account the ability of the masses to bear the burden. Article 2: The amount of each person's salary shall be determined within the prescribed range by the school, with reference to the local living standards, and based on the actual educational level, work ability, work attitude, work complexity, teaching performance, and years of service of the teaching staff (for janitorial staff, it is mainly based on work complexity, work ability, and work attitude, etc.). Specific opinions shall be submitted to the competent authority for approval and revised every six months. Article 3: Salaries shall be paid for twelve months of the year, including holidays. Teachers who leave their positions at the end of the semester shall receive one-half of their salary for the vacation period. The salaries of newly appointed teachers, teaching staff who leave their positions midway, and janitorial staff shall be calculated from the date of arrival to the date of departure from the school.

    B. Standards for Rural and General Towns. Article 4: Teachers and staff above the level of主任 (主任, generally translated as "Director" or "Head") in middle or normal schools shall receive a monthly salary of 200 to 300 jin (市秤, or "market catty," used here as a unit of measure for rice) of rice (市秤, the same below). Teachers and staff above the level of主任 in senior high schools or specialized schools equivalent to senior high schools shall receive a monthly salary of 250 to 350 jin of rice. Article 5: General staff shall receive a monthly salary of 130 to 200 jin of rice. Article 6: Janitorial staff shall receive a monthly salary of 110 to 150 jin of rice.

    C. Standards for Medium and Large Cities (such as Shijiazhuang, Baoding, etc.; other cities such as Yangquan, Linqing, Handan, Xingtai, etc., may also refer to this, but should be lower). Article 7: Teachers and staff above the level of主任 in middle and normal schools shall receive a monthly salary of 220 to 350 jin of rice. Teachers and staff above the level of主任 in senior high schools or specialized schools equivalent to senior high schools shall receive a monthly salary of 300 to 400 jin of rice. Article 8: General staff shall receive a monthly salary of 140 to 220 jin of rice. Article 9: Janitorial staff shall receive a monthly salary of 120 to 160 jin of rice.

    D. Maternity Expenses and Childcare for Female Teaching Staff. Article 10: Female teachers shall be granted 60 days of leave before and after childbirth, and their salaries shall be paid as usual. Article 11: The expenses for raising children born to female teachers shall be borne jointly by both parents. If the salary income is insufficient to cover these expenses, subsidies may be granted before the child reaches the age of six, according to the following methods:
    　　(1) The standard for childcare expenses is 120 jin of rice per child per month.
    　　(2) Deduct the individual's living expenses from their personal salary income, and calculate the remaining amount according to the childcare standard. The difference between the standard and the remaining salary is the amount to be subsidized.
    　　(3) The individual's living expenses are calculated as follows: 140 jin of rice per month for general staff in middle schools; 160 jin of rice per month for teachers and staff above the level of主任; 120 jin of rice per month for primary school teachers (if the salary is less than this amount, the salary amount shall be used). In enterprises, personnel equivalent to technicians above the level of 技正 (a technical title) or staff at the bureau level and above shall be calculated at 180 jin of rice per month, and staff below this level shall be calculated at 160 jin of rice per month.

    Article 12: Childcare subsidies shall be discontinued for those who leave their positions midway. The childcare subsidies for those who have been receiving a salary for two years or more may be reduced appropriately. Article 13: All expenses incurred due to the maternity and childcare benefits for female teachers shall be included in the school's temporary budget and reimbursed based on actual expenses.

    E. Supplementary Provisions. Article 14: These interim standards are only applicable to middle or normal schools that use North China funds. Article 15: These interim standards shall be implemented from January 1949.

　　中等学校的教职员有没有统一的待遇标准？编辑同志：
    我是某师范学校的教员，有几个有关我们切身利益的问题，提出来请你们或有关当局代为解答：
    一、现在我们华北解放区，对于中等学校及师范学校的教职员的待遇，到底有没有统一的规定？根据什么条件作标准？乡村和城市生活程度各殊，是否待遇也各有不同？
    二、按照过去惯例，教职员寒、暑假期间的薪金，一般说来是照发的，现在是否还是这样？中途离职的怎么办？
    三、女教职员在生育期间，当然要请假，假期长短是不是应该要有合理的规定？休假期间薪金是否还照发呢？
    四、生了孩子，据说学校可以补助一部分养育费，详细情形怎样？这笔开支学校如何处理？　　　　　读者燕妮燕妮同志：
