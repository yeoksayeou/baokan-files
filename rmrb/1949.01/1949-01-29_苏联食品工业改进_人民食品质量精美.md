Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: While hundreds of millions of people in the capitalist world are trapped in hunger and hardship, the Soviet people are enjoying an increasing supply of food with improving quality. According to TASS: Soviet Minister of Food Industry, Zotov, declared that the food production in the first year of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan increased by 13 percent; in 1947, due to the severe drought in some states in 1946, it only increased by 8 percent; but in 1948, it increased by 34.8 percent. Factories manufacturing sweets, cheese, canned goods, starch, syrup, etc., have all completed their production plans for the entire year of 1948. Compared with the first eleven months of 1947, the first eleven months of 1948 saw an increase of 44 percent in bread and other baked goods, 43 percent in sweets, 36 percent in vegetable oil, and 46 percent in soup (i.e., canned soup and soup powder). In 1948, the quality of products in various sectors of the food industry improved, with some exceeding pre-war standards.

Zotov continued: In the first three years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the government allocated 2.3 billion rubles to restore factories destroyed by the German bandits and build new ones. Several sugar factories have resumed operation in 1948, and many factories have been retrofitted with new machines and expanded. For example, the baked goods industry now has a network of huge baked goods manufacturing plants equipped with modern machinery. Sixteen cheese factories equipped in a modern way have also been completed. The salt industry has also been modernized in the same way.

Zotov concluded: The various measures taken by the Party and the government in agriculture have created all the necessary preconditions for further increasing the output of raw materials for the food industry. On this basis, the workers in the food industry will greatly increase food production in 1949 to fulfill the task given to them by Stalin: to provide the Soviet people with a fully abundant supply of food on Soviet soil.

　　苏联食品工业改进
  　人民食品质量精美
    【新华社陕北十九日电】当资本主义世界亿万人民正陷于饥饿困苦中间的时候，苏联人民却享受着数量一天天增多、质量一天天精美的食品供应。据塔斯社讯：苏联食品工业部部长佐托夫宣称：苏联战后五年计划的食品生产头一年，增加了百分之十三；一九四七年，由于一九四六年某些州的亢旱，只增加了百分之八；而一九四八年，却增加了百分之三十四·八。制造糖果、乳酪、罐头、淀粉、糖浆等的工厂，都完成了一九四八年全年的生产计划。一九四八年头十一个月与一九四七年头十一个月相较，面包及其他烘烤食品增加了百分之四十四，糖果增加了百分之四十三，菜油百分之三十六，汤（即罐头汤及汤粉）百分之四十六。一九四八年，食品工业各部门的产品质量都有改进，其中有一些已超过战前标准。
    佐托夫继称：在战后五年计划的头三年中，政府曾拨款二十三亿卢布恢复被德寇破坏了的工厂并建筑新厂。有若干制糖厂已于一九四八年重新开工，有许多工厂改装了新机器并加以扩大。例如烘烤食品工业，现在有装备着现代化机器的巨大的烘烤食品制造厂的网。有十六个按照现代化方式装备的乳酪厂也已经落成。制盐工业也同样地现代化了。
    佐托夫结语称：党和政府在农业方面所采取的各种措施，已创造了一切必要的前提条件，以便更进一步增加食品工业原料的产量。在这个基础上，食品工业的工人们在一九四九年将大大增加食品的产量，以完成斯大林所交给他们的任务：即在苏联的土地上，供给苏维埃人民充分丰富的食品。
