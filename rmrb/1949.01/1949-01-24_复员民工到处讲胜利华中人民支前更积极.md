Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th—The first group of demobilized full-time laborers from Central China are spreading news of the People's Liberation Army's great victories witnessed at the front, which has greatly promoted the continued mobilization of the people of Central China to support the front. When the news of the demobilization of laborers was transmitted from the front to the rear, the rear organs and the masses prepared to warmly welcome them. As soon as the laborers from Dongtai County arrived, a 10,000-person celebration and welcome meeting was held immediately. The laborers enthusiastically reported the victories at the front and their experiences on the expedition, greatly encouraging the masses present. When the demobilized laborers from Ye Ting, Funing, Sheyang, Huai, and other nine counties returned home in glory, it coincided with the departure of the second group of laborers to the front. On the one hand, they publicized the victories to the second group of laborers, introduced their experiences in life, work, marching, camping, and air defense at the front. At the same time, they assured the latter that they would definitely unite the masses in their hometowns and villages to help the families of the second group of laborers who were going on the expedition. The laborers who were about to go on the expedition said: We guarantee to resolutely complete the task and return home only after making meritorious service! In Haizhong District of Southeast County (newly formed by the merger of Haimen and Qidong counties) in central Jiangsu, the demobilized laborers, holding the newly awarded weapons for meritorious service, told the local armed squad: "There are many howitzers, mountain guns, and anti-aircraft guns in the main force of the People's Liberation Army!" Another demobilized laborer told the squad: Once, the Liberation Army captured a large pile of enemy shells, and it took 3,000 laborers half a day to move them all. The people of the squad were very happy to hear this and immediately reported to the squad leader, requesting that he be promoted to the main force. Demobilized laborers from the @Cha and @Feng districts of Rudong County (a newly established county in the southeast of Rugao) reported their hard work and meritorious service during the expedition at a meeting, and many listeners were very moved. One cadre said: "I used to be afraid of joining the army and being a full-time laborer, but now after listening to the reports of the demobilized laborers, I feel sorry for the Party." After the meeting, almost all district and village cadres in the eleven villages of the district requested to go to the front to support the front. Demobilized laborers from Changan and Xilai districts of Jingjiang County organized a reporting team to assist the government in mobilizing the people in the rear, and went to various militia and families of the second group of laborers to publicize the victory and that the People's Liberation Army was fighting to liberate all the Chinese people, etc. After in-depth publicity, the next day, when the whole township mobilized the porters, the number of people who volunteered was very enthusiastic.

　　复员民工到处讲胜利华中人民支前更积极
    【新华社华东十四日电】华中光荣复员的第一期常备民工，到处宣传其在前方目击的人民解放军的伟大胜利，对继续动员华中人民支援前线，起了很大作用。当民工复员的消息从前方传到后方时，各后方机关和群众便准备热烈欢迎。东台县民工一到，立刻就举行了万人庆功欢迎会，民工们热烈地报告了前方的胜利和出征的见闻，大大地鼓舞了到会群众。叶挺、阜宁、射阳、淮等九县复员民工荣归时，正逢当地二期民工出征，他们一方面向二期民工宣传胜利，介绍在前方的生活、工作、行军、宿营、防空的经验，同时，向后者保证，自己在家里，一定团结本乡本村群众，帮助二期出征民工家庭的生产。正待出征的民工们说：我们保证坚决完成任务，立功才回家！在苏中东南县（由海门、启东两县合并而成）的海中区，复员的民工手执立功受奖的新武器告诉当地的武装小队：“人民解放军主力部队里，榴弹炮、山炮、机关炮多得很！”另一个复员民工告诉小队：有一次解放军缴获了敌军一大堆炮弹，动员三千民工搬半天还搬不完。小队的人听了非常高兴，马上报告小队长要求上升他到主力部队去。如东县（如皋东南部新设县）＠茶、＠丰两区复员民工在一次会议上报告他们在出征中艰苦奋斗与立功的情形，说得有声有色，许多听众很受感动。一个干部说：“我过去怕参军，怕做常备民工，现在听了复员民工的报告，比比自己实在对不起党。”会后该区十一乡的区村干部差不多全部向上级请求出征支前。靖江县长安、西来两区复员民工，为协助政府动员后方人民而组织报导组，向各地民兵及二期出征民工家属分头宣传胜利，宣传人民解放军作战是为了解放全中国人民等。经过深入宣传后，第二天全乡动员挑子时，自动报名的非常踊跃。
