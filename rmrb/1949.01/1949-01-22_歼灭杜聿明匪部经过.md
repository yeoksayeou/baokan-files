Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 18th. The complete annihilation of the Du Yuming bandit group has victoriously concluded the unprecedented large-scale annihilation battle in the People's Liberation War—the Huaihai Campaign.

While the battle to encircle and annihilate the Huang Wei Corps was still underway, the People's Liberation Army on the Huaihai Front began a larger encirclement and annihilation battle against the Du Yuming bandit group's Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang three corps. On December 1st, the Du Yuming bandit group's three corps, along with special forces, irregular troops, and rear-area organs, totaling approximately 300,000 men, abandoned Xuzhou and fled westward. They ran at a speed of 120 li per day, but after only one day, the pursuing People's Liberation Army caught up with them, and by the 4th, they were completely surrounded in an area of no more than 20 li in length and width around Lishilin, Qinglongji, and Chen Guanzhuang northeast of Yongcheng. During the escape, the 300,000 enemies, scrambling and vying with each other, were mixed into a团, with baggage, artillery, and vehicles abandoned along the way. In addition to the officers and soldiers fleeing in droves, more than 20,000 were killed, wounded, or captured by the People's Liberation Army. On the 6th, the Sun Yuanliang Corps attempted to break through to the west, but most of them were immediately annihilated, and the few who escaped the encirclement were also pursued and annihilated en route. Thereafter, from the 8th to the 15th, the enemy attempted to break through several times, but were completely defeated by the People's Liberation Army's heavy blows.

Hunger and severe cold plunged the besieged enemy into great chaos and despair. The enemy lost their cotton-padded clothing and quilts during the escape, had no food, no fuel, ate all the horse hides, and even burned all the wooden planks used for fortifications, and a large number of them froze to death and starved to death in the heavy wind and snow. In order to give the enemy a final way out, from December 16th, the People's Liberation Army ceased its attacks and ordered Du Yuming, Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and others to immediately lead their troops to surrender, while at the same time beginning widespread frontline persuasion work. Ranks, companies, and battalions of Kuomintang officers and soldiers who were unwilling to die for the Du bandits and others, disregarded the tight blockade and cruel suppression, escaped across the front lines to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. By the 5th of this month, a total of more than 14,000 people had surrendered under the persuasion of the People's Liberation Army. However, Du Yuming, Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and other bandit leaders not only refused to surrender, but also, regardless of the People's Liberation Army's warnings, continuously fired poison gas bombs at the People's Liberation Army.

At 3:00 PM on the 6th, the People's Liberation Army launched the final general attack on the enemy who were unwilling to surrender. The heroic and fearless People's Liberation Army quickly broke through the enemy's resistance. By 10:00 AM on the 10th, the People's Liberation Army had completely resolved the enemy. From the start of the attack at 3:00 PM on the 6th, in less than four days, this Du Yuming bandit group, possessing approximately 300,000 men, was completely annihilated. …

　　歼灭杜聿明匪部经过
    【新华社淮海前线十八日电】杜聿明匪部的全军覆没已经胜利地结束了人民解放战争中空前大规模的歼灭战——准海战役。
    当围歼黄维兵团的作战还正在进行中的时候，淮海前线人民解放军就开始了对杜聿明匪部邱清泉、李弥、孙元良三个兵团的更大的围歼战。十二月一日，南逃被阻的杜聿明匪部三个兵团及特种部队、非正规军和后方机关等共约三十万人，抛弃徐州西逃。他们以一天一百二十里的速度奔跑着，但是只跑了一天，追捕的解放军就扭住了他们，至四日就将他们全部包围在永城东北李石林、青龙集、陈官庄一带纵横不过二十里的地区。在逃跑中，争先恐后的三十万敌人混作了一团，辎重、大炮和汽车遗弃满途，官兵除纷纷逃亡外，被解放军毙伤俘二万余人。六日，孙元良兵团向西突围，但大部立即被歼，少数逃出包围圈的也在途中被追歼。此后，自八日至十五日，敌人又曾数次试图突围，但都遭到解放军的痛击而完全失败。
    饥饿和严寒使被围困的敌人陷入极大的混乱和绝望中。敌人在逃跑中丢掉了棉衣棉被，没有粮食，没有燃料，连马皮也吃光，连作工事的木板也烧光，在大风雪中大批冻死饿死。为了给敌人以最后一条生路，从十二月十六日起，解放军停止攻击，命令杜聿明、邱清泉、李弥等立即率部投降，同时开始了普遍的火线劝降工作。成排、成连、成营不愿为杜匪等送死的国民党军官兵，不顾严密的封锁和残酷的镇压，逃过火线向解放军投降，至本月五日止，这样在解放军劝告下投降的就共有一万四千余人。但是杜聿明、邱清泉、李弥等匪首，不仅拒绝投降，并且不顾解放军的警告，向解放军连续放射毒气弹。
    六日下午三时，解放军对不愿投降的敌人开始了最后的总攻击。英勇无畏的解放军迅速击破了敌人的抵抗。十日上午十时，解放军就全部解决了敌人。从六日下午三时发起攻击起，不到四天，这一拥有约三十万人的杜聿明匪部就此全军覆灭了。……
