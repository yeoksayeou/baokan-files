Taihang Electric Dispatch: Under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, a certain clothing factory in Taihang organized women in the Chengguan District of Wu'an to make military uniforms. The results were remarkable, with more than 138,000 cotton-padded military uniforms made in five months. Initially, only the 15th Street Cooperative in the city helped women find some work to do to earn a living. Later, women from other streets, seeing that it was profitable, also requested the cooperative to find clothing work from the clothing factory. Later, in order to complete the task ahead of schedule and organize women's production, the clothing factory, together with the leaders of the Chengguan District, jointly organized women from the entire Chengguan District to participate in the work in May of this year. Women from all streets actively participated. Starting from June, an average of more than 1,480 people participated daily. The organizational method was mainly through cooperatives. Various forms were created based on the different conditions of the women themselves. Women without children were formed into groups to work in the factory; the elderly with children and those who could not leave home were uniformly led by the women cadres of each street to take the work home. The entire task was completed in five months. More than 450 women working in the factory made more than 78,900 pieces. 1,020 women outside the factory completed more than 60,000 pieces in addition to doing housework at home. The women also showed initiative in their work, not only working quickly but also doing a good job. The women participating in the factory worked from early morning until late at night, and they also took great care of public property. One day in the middle of the night, the sky suddenly turned cloudy. The chairman of the women's federation in one street, fearing that the military uniforms placed under the mansion would get wet, quickly got up and ran a long way to move all the cotton-padded clothes home, which was praised by the factory. This method of organizing production that takes into account both public and private interests has solved great difficulties for the women. A total of more than 670,000 yuan (new currency) was earned, which could buy more than 191,500 catties of rice, averaging more than 130 catties of rice per person. Some women have already invested the money they earned in further production. Qi Suihe, who is over forty years old, and her niece opened a flour mill with the money they earned, and Wang Lian invested his wages in the cooperative.

　　太行某被服厂组织妇女作棉衣
  　成绩显著公私两利
    【太行电】太行某被服厂在公私兼顾的原则下，组织武安城关区妇女做军衣，成绩显著，五个月做好棉军衣十三万八千余件。该厂开始只有城内十五街合作社来给妇女揽些生活，后来其他各街妇女见有利可图，也纷纷要求合作社到被服厂揽衣服做工。后来被服厂为提前完成任务与组织妇女生产，特于今年五月与城关区领导上共同组织全城关区妇女参加工作。各街妇女踊跃参加，从六月开始，每日平均有一千四百八十余人，组织办法主要是通过合作社。依据妇女本身的不同条件，创造了各种形式。没有小孩的编成小组在厂里工作：年老的有小孩的及家里离不开的，均由各街妇女干部统一领上回家做。五个月全部完成任务。在厂内做工的四百五十余妇女，共做了七万八千九百余件。厂外一千零二十个妇女，做了家里杂活外，共完成六万余件。做工中妇女们也表现了自觉，不但做得快，而且做得好。参加厂里的妇女都是起早搭黑的做，对于公物也是十分爱护。有一天半夜忽然天阴了，一街的妇女主席怕把放在大厦底下的军衣湿了，就很快起来从好远地方跑去把棉衣都搬到家里，受到厂方表扬。这种公私兼顾组织生产的办法，给妇女们解决了很大困难。总共赚洋六十七万余元（新币），可买米十九万一千五百余斤，每人平均得米一百三十多斤。有些妇女已将赚的钱投入了再生产。四十余岁的祁随的和他的外甥女，将赚的钱开了一座粉坊，王连的将工钱入了合作社。
