　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS Moscow dispatch: A Labor Newspaper observer recently wrote an article stating: The Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of the Scandinavian countries held a meeting in Karlstad, Sweden on January 5th and 6th. This meeting was convened under pressure from the United States. The meeting had to determine the position of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark on the Atlantic Pact. The motivation for the U.S. State Department's strenuous efforts to engage the Scandinavian countries is well known. Norwegian ports are ideal bases for the U.S. and British fleets. Flying fortresses can land at German airfields in Denmark, which have been kept intact according to U.S. instructions after the Germans were driven out; they can also land at Sola Airport in Norway and Bromma and Karlsborg airports in Sweden. U.S. militarists first chose the right wing of the Norwegian Social Democratic Party in Scandinavia as their agents, who have long declared that they are very happy to serve U.S. interests. It was none other than Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange who made it known in the Labor Party's central organ, "Labor News," that Norway is not only prepared to participate in the military, political, and economic system of the Atlantic bloc, but also prepared to cooperate with Denmark and Sweden in all these aspects, and in some aspects with Finland as well. In other words, Lange is trying to drag Finland into military gambling as well. The Labor Newspaper observer stated: However, the brief blitz by Wall Street's Norwegian agents in Karlstad did not produce the results Washington had expected. Recognizing the sentiment of the masses against the military bloc policy, the Swedish representatives refused to openly follow Norway's example. Sweden mentioned its "traditional neutrality" policy and avoided directly accepting U.S. orders. But behind this smokescreen, the Swedish right-wing Social Democrats are advocating the organization of a so-called "neutral" Scandinavian alliance. As for the Danish delegation that participated in the Karlstad meeting, the Labor Newspaper observer pointed out: The delegation did not dare to openly accept the Atlantic Pact, but at the same time, it did not dare to sharply oppose the wishes of the U.S. militarist elements. Diplomats in Copenhagen believe that they can use this trick to deceive the vigilance of the Scandinavian people and drag Northern Europe into the U.S. trap by roundabout means. The observer concluded: The dangerous activities of the Atlantic bloc, the Nordic bloc, and other similar military blocs are all contrary to the interests of the Scandinavian people and are bound to fail.

  　苏劳动报著文抨击
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报观察家顷著文称：斯堪的纳维亚各国总理和外长，曾于一月五、六两日在瑞典的卡尔斯塔德城开会。这一会议是在美国压力之下召开的。会议必须确定挪威、瑞典和丹麦对大西洋公约的立场。美国国务院之所以如此努力地活动斯堪的纳维亚国家，其动机是尽人皆知的。挪威的港口是美、英舰队的理想基地。飞行堡垒可以在丹麦的德国机场降落，这些机场在德国人被驱逐以后遵照美国的意见保持完好如初；也可以在挪威的索尔机场和瑞典的布罗姆和卡尔姆星机场降落。美国军国主义者在斯堪的纳维亚最先选择了挪威社会民主党右翼作为他们的代理人，这些人很久以来就宣称，他们十分高兴为美国利益服务。不是别人，正是挪威外长兰基在工党中央机关报“劳动新闻”上使大家知道：挪威不仅准备参加大西洋集团的军事、政治和经济体系，而且准备在所有这些方面与丹麦和瑞典以及在某些方面也与芬兰取得合作。换句话说，兰基约许把芬兰也拖入军事赌博之中。劳动报观察家称：然而，华尔街的挪威代理人在卡尔斯塔德的短促突击，并没有产生华盛顿所预期的结果。瑞典代表认识到反对军事集团政策的群众的情绪，拒绝公开效法挪威的例子。瑞典提到它的“传统的中立”政策，规避直接接受美国的敕令。但在这一烟幕之后，瑞典右翼社会民主党正在主张组织所谓“中立的”斯堪的纳维亚联盟。至于参加卡尔斯塔德会议的丹麦代表团，劳动报观察家指出：该团不敢冒险公然接受大西洋公约，但是，它同时又不敢尖锐反对美军国主义分子的愿望。哥本哈根的外交家们认为：他们可以借这一手法欺骗斯堪的纳维亚人民的警惕心，而以转弯抹角的道路将北欧拖入美国的陷阱。观察家结语称：不论是大西洋集团、北欧集团和其他类似的军事集团的危险勾当，都是违背斯堪的纳维亚人民利益的，是一定要失败的。
