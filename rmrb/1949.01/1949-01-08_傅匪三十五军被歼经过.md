[From the Pingzhang Front] A front-line reporter reports on the annihilation of the 35th Army of the traitor Fu at Xinbaoan: When the People's Liberation Army approached Zhangjiakou in early December, Fu, seeing that his westward escape route was about to be cut off, hurriedly sent Guo Jingyun, the commander of the 35th Army, with the 101st Division and the 267th Division, from Beiping in more than 400 American-made trucks to reinforce the area. Unexpectedly, before they had been in Zhangjiakou for two days, Beiping was suddenly under pressure, and the Pingzhang section was severely threatened. Fu then urgently ordered the 35th Army to return, limited to returning to Kangzhuang that day. When the 35th Army of the traitor Fu had just escaped Xiayuan, a unit of the People's Liberation Army had quickly occupied Xinbaoan, blocking the road ahead. The bandits abused American-made planes and artillery to ram, crash, and bombard indiscriminately, making a commotion all day, but they did not open an escape route. At dusk, they crashed into the city of Xinbaoan, but they just happened to drill into the net set by the Liberation Army in advance. The traitor Fu couldn't bear to have his darling cut off, so he made a desperate gamble, sending the 104th Army and the 16th Army westward to rescue them. At the same time, he ordered the 35th Army to break through at all costs, but the result was a complete failure. They were once less than eight li apart, but they were repelled by the Liberation Army in separate ways. The 104th Army and the 16th Army were surrounded and annihilated by another large army of ours on the way back. The 35th Army has since been hopelessly besieged in Xinbaoan, waiting for the fate of being annihilated. The streets and alleys of Xinbaoan are filled with American-made transport trucks, and nearly 20,000 people are crowded in this city of a thousand households, eating sorghum and black beans every day. On December 21, the artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army's general offensive sounded. The outer positions were cleared on the first day, and the city was attacked at 7:00 am on the second day. The artillery roared in unison. Under the intense and accurate artillery fire of our army, the enemy's forward positions and fortifications on the city head were destroyed. In the smoky dust, a red flag suddenly rose on the southeast corner of the city, fluttering in the wind. A certain brigade had taken the lead in breaking through the enemy's position and taking the lead in climbing the city. The army surged in. In the west of the city, our army successively rushed into the city after heroically defeating the enemy's several desperate counterattacks. The enemy was quickly encircled and divided by our army and annihilated one by one. At 6:00 pm, Feng Zi, the commander of the 101st Division, and his remnants, under the power of our artillery fire, finally ordered a collective surrender, and the battle ended victoriously. The enemy had vainly attempted to defend Xinbaoan for half a month to twenty days, but it collapsed in just eleven hours. The 35th Army, which Fu had painstakingly cultivated for twenty years and relied on to make his fortune, except for the remnants of the 262nd Division who remained in Beiping and were temporarily spared, was declared destroyed from then on. Even more ridiculous is that the planes rarely delivered supplies to the besieged 35th Army of the traitor Fu a few days ago, but on the second day after the battle ended, two transport planes dropped dozens of packages of rice and flour over Xinbaoan for the Liberation Army, which shows how incompetent and chaotic Fu's command was.

　　傅匪三十五军被歼经过
    【平张前线电】前线记者报导傅匪三十五军于新保安被歼经过称：当人民解放军于十二月初逼近张家口时，傅匪眼看着他西逃的路要被切断，赶忙派三十五军军长郭景云带着一零一师和二六七师从北平坐着四百多辆美造卡车前去增援，不料到达张家口还没有两天，北平突然吃紧，平张段受严重威胁，傅匪又急调三十五军向回返，限当天赶回康庄，当傅匪三十五军刚逃过下花园时，解放军某部已迅速占领新保安，迎面拦住去路，匪徒们曾滥用美造的飞机大炮乱冲、乱撞、乱炸射，整闹腾了一天，也没有打开一条逃路，黄昏时撞入新保安城，却恰恰钻进解放军事先张着口儿的网套里。傅匪不忍他的心头肉被剜，就孤去注一掷，先后派一零四军及十六军西来接援，同时又命令三十五军冒死突围，结果还是完全失败，他们曾经相距不到八里之遥，却被解放军分路击退，一零四军和十六军于回窜的路上，又被我另支大军包围全部被歼。三十五军从此就绝望的被围在新保安等待着被歼的命运。新保安的大街小巷摆满了美造运输大卡车，近两万人堆挤在这个千户人家的城里，每日以高粱黑豆充饥。十二月二十一日解放军总攻的炮火响了，第一天扫清外围，第二天早晨七点钟开始攻城，大炮轰轰的连成一片，在我密集准确炮火轰击下，敌前沿及城头工事尽毁，烟尘迷漫中，城东南角上忽然飞起一面红旗，迎风飘扬，某旅已首先突破敌阵抢先登城。大军汹涌而入。城西我军在英勇打垮敌人数次垂死反击后，相继冲进城内，敌被我迅速迂回分割，逐一歼灭，下午六时一零一师师长冯梓及其残部，在我炮火威力下，最后下令集体缴械，战斗胜利结束。敌人曾妄图死守新保安半月到二十天，仅仅十一个钟头就土崩瓦解，傅匪二十年来苦心培植、赖以起家的三十五军除残部二六二师留住北平暂时幸免外，从此宣告覆灭。更可笑的是前几天飞机对被围的傅匪三十五军很少投运，而在战斗结束后的第二天，两架运输机却在新保安上空给解放军投下几十包大米白面来，可见傅匪的指挥是如何的无能和混乱。
