Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 25th -- The new currency of the People's Bank of China has begun circulating in the Central Plains Liberated Area. The people are eagerly using it, greatly facilitating market trade between the various liberated areas. The circulation of the new currency in the markets of the Central Plains Liberated Area has been officially announced by the Yuxi and Yu-Wan-Su Administrative Offices of the Central Plains Liberated Area, as well as the Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang Municipal Governments, simultaneously in early January. It stipulates that the new currency will circulate in the market mixed with the Zhongzhou Peasant Bank currency at natural parity. In order to reduce the trouble of merchants and civilians exchanging chips, it is also stipulated that the currencies of banks in neighboring areas such as Southern Hebei, Northern Jiangsu, and Central China will be prohibited for a limited time. The Zhongzhou Peasant Bank will unconditionally redeem them at natural parity until the redemption is complete. Historically, a considerable amount of Southern Hebei currency, Northern Jiangsu currency, and Central China currency have circulated in the Central Plains area. Before and at the beginning of the issuance of the Zhongzhou currency, these currencies of friendly neighboring areas replaced or assisted the Zhongzhou currency in expanding the market and expelling enemy currency. Now, because the Zhongzhou currency has firmly occupied the market, and the Central Plains area has been completely connected with friendly neighboring liberated areas such as East China, North China, Central China, and Northwest China, transportation is convenient, trade is frequent, and complete unification of economic and trade work between the various regions is required, the above-mentioned new measures have been decided.

　　中国人民银行新币
  　开始在中原流通
  　便利贸易人民争相使用
    【新华社中原二十五日电】中国人民银行新币开始在中原解放区流通，人民争相使用，予各解放区间市场贸易极大便利。该行新币在中原解放区各市场的流通，业经中原解放区豫西及豫皖苏两行政公署和开封、郑州及洛阳三市政府于本月上旬同时发出布告通知各地，规定新币按自然比价与中州农民银行币在市场混合流通。为减少商民的兑换筹码麻烦，并规定限期禁用冀南、北海、华中等友邻地区银行的货币，而由中州农民银行按自然比价无限制收兑，负责兑完为止。按中原区向来流通着相当数量的冀南钞、北海钞和华中钞。这几种友邻区货币在中州币发行以前与发行之初，曾代替或协助中州币开扩市场，驱逐敌币。现因中州币已巩固地占领市场，而中原区与华东、华北、华中、西北等友邻解放区业已完全联成一片，交通便利，贸易频繁，要求各区间经济和贸易工作的完全统一，乃决定采取上述新措施。
