　　[Jidong Telegram] After the liberation of Tongxian City, forty miles east of Beiping, workers in public enterprises such as the city's power plant, repair shop, electric light company, telecommunications bureau, and water company, under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, improved labor efficiency and actively supported the front lines. Before the Chiang bandits fled the city, they dismantled all the machinery in the repair shop, attempting to move it away. However, fearing annihilation, they fled in a hurry, taking only part of the machinery. After the bandit army fled, the workers of the repair shop voluntarily returned to the factory, reinstalled most of the remaining machinery, and resumed work on the third day, repairing guns for the People's Liberation Army. Guo Zaitian, a worker with twenty years of experience, actively led two apprentices to the iron factory to borrow machines to repair machine guns and cart parts for the People's Liberation Army before the machines were even installed, working several night shifts in a row. He said, "I am especially happy that the People's Liberation Army has arrived." Li Long'an, the newly elected democratic class leader, continued to work with the lights on after everyone else had gone home to rest. The electric light company originally had nine people working and was still struggling to keep up, but now only six people are persisting in their work. After liberation, they all moved to the company to live and work day and night. Zhao Linsen, an elderly worker in his fifties, persisted in working despite being ill. Jiao Zhaonan, a staff member, managed the work of several people in the past all by himself. The workers at the power plant were in high spirits and kept the machines clean and shiny. They also paid close attention to saving materials; in the past, they needed 18 tons of coal every day, but now they only need 15 to 17 tons, saving 1 to 3 tons of coal. The staff and workers have also initially established a learning system. The workers at the power plant study for one and a half hours every day under the leadership of working comrades. They all said, "We especially welcome lectures." The workers at the Third Well of the water company were coerced by the enemy to go to Beiping, so the workers at the Second Well automatically went to the Third Well to repair the machinery and continue to deliver water as usual. The Military Control Commission has paid the workers half of their original base salary in grain and half in local currency as temporary living expenses. The workers were moved to tears when they received the grain and currency, saying, "The democratic government has only been here for a few days, and it has already given us money and grain. The enemy didn't pay us for several months, and we couldn't even afford to eat."

　　通县工人积极复工
  　修械所加夜班赶修枪炮
    【冀东电】北平东四十里的通县城解放后，城内发电厂、修械所、电灯公司、电讯局、自来水公司等公营企业工人，在军管会领导下，提高劳动效率，积极支援前线。蒋匪逃离该城前，曾把修械所的机器全部拆卸，企图搬走，因慑于被歼，仓惶逃窜，只带走机器一部。该所工人于匪军逃窜后，都自动回厂，把遗下的大部机器，重新安装，于第三天，即行复工，给解放军修理枪炮。二十年的老工人郭再田，在机器尚未装好之前，积极带领两个学徒到铁工厂去借机器给解放军修理机枪和大车零件，连做几个夜班。他说：“解放军来了，我特别高兴。”民主新选的班长李龙安下班以后，人家都去休息，他自己还打开灯工作。电灯公司原来九人工作都忙不过来，现只剩下六人坚持工作，解放后，他们都搬到公司去住，昼夜工作，五十多岁的老工人赵林森，带病坚持工作，职员焦兆南一人管理了过去好几个人的工作。发电厂工人情绪高涨，把机器擦得又光又亮。并极注意节约物资；过去每天需煤十八吨，现在只需十五吨到十七吨，节省煤一至三吨。职工们并初步建立了学习制度，发电厂工人，在工作同志领导下，每天学习一个半钟头。他们都说：“我们特别欢迎讲课”。自来水公司三井工人被敌胁迫去北平，二井工人就自动到三井去修理机器，照常送水。军管会已按工人原来底薪，发给一半粮食，一半本币，作为暂时维持费。工人们得到粮食或本币后，感动的说：“民主政府来了这么几天，就发给咱们钱和粮食，敌人在时好几个月都不发薪，连饭都顾不上。”
