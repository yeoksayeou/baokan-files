　　Winter Study Content Should Suit the Needs of the Masses
　　Question: In the past, the higher authorities paid great attention to the people's schools, constantly holding meetings for voluntary teachers to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the people's schools. At that time, the work of voluntary teachers did not feel particularly difficult. Since this spring, the higher authorities have neither arranged nor inspected the people's schools, and the general public believes that the higher authorities no longer pay attention to them. Teachers feel a lack of teaching materials, and the masses also feel disinterested. Is this due to incorrect educational methods, or are the people's schools simply not important anymore? Now the higher authorities are again calling for the establishment of people's schools (winter studies). I request the higher authorities to help run this winter's people's schools well, and not let them become nominal and ineffective.

　　Answer: In order to meet the cultural demands of the masses and raise their political consciousness, it is very necessary to vigorously run winter studies and people's schools. Is there a laissez-faire phenomenon toward winter studies in your area? The Jingxing County government should promptly inspect and earnestly resolve the difficulties for the lower levels. It is not enough to only have calls and instructions without concrete guidance and help. To run winter studies well, first, it is necessary to establish a sound village winter study committee, taking the organization of the masses and the conduct of political and cultural education as a regular and important task, overcoming the phenomenon of higher authorities making arrangements but no one in the village taking charge. Second, the content of winter studies must be based on the needs of the masses (such as some wanting to learn to read, and some wanting to learn abacus), and adapt to their living and production conditions, organizing various cultural learning activities. Only winter studies with newspaper reading, literacy, and learning to write and calculate can attract enthusiastic participation from the masses. In teaching, voluntary teachers should pay special attention to cultivating active learners and model learning groups, laying the foundation for year-round people's schools. As for how to solve the problem of textbooks, in addition to the winter study materials compiled and distributed by the higher authorities, you can still use the people's literacy textbooks, common characters for daily use by the people, characters for farming, and rural practical writing, etc., compiled and printed in recent years to solve the difficulty of lacking teaching materials that you mentioned. We hope that you will write to us later about your experiences in organizing mass learning and solving textbook problems.

专栏：询问与答复

　　冬学内容要适合群众需要
    问：从前上级对民校很注意，不断召开义务教员会议，总结民校的好坏，那时义务教员的工作，也不觉有什么困难。自今春到现在，上级对民校不布置也不检查，一般群众认为上级对民校不注意了。教员感觉教材缺乏，群众也觉得没有兴趣，这是教育方法方式不对呢？还是民校就不重要了呢？现在上级又叫成立民校（冬学），我要求上级帮助把今冬民校办好，不要搞成有名无实不起作用的民校。　　　　　　　　　
　　井陉九区　子芳、子馨
    答：为满足群众的文化要求，提高其政治觉悟，大力开办冬学和民校，是非常必要的。你们那里是否对冬学有放任自流现象？井陉县政府要及时检查，并切实给下面解决困难。单有号召指示，而没有具体的指导帮助，是不解决问题的。办好冬学，首先要建全起村冬学委员会，把组织群众与进行政治文化教育，作为经常和重要的任务，克服上级有布置，村里没人管的现象。其次冬学内容，必须根据群众的需要（如有的是为学认字，有的是为了学珠算等），适应其生活与生产条件，组织各种文化学习活动。只有这种有读报、有识字、学写学算的冬学，才能吸引群众热烈参加。义务教员在教学当中，要特别注意培养学习中的积极分子和模范学习小组，打下常年民校的基础。至于如何解决课本问题，除上级编发的冬学教材外，仍可选用近年编印的民众认字课本、老百姓日用杂字、庄稼杂字、以及农村应用文等，以解决你所提到的缺乏教材的困难。在组织群众学习及解决课本问题上，希望把你们的经验，以后写信告知我们。
