　　Boys and Girls Should Not Marry
　　Question: Have there been changes in the policies and regulations of the People's Government regarding marriage issues? Are there restrictions on the marriage of boys and girls? Should the government intervene? In Shili Pu Village, west of Jin County, Zhao Dahu has a son who is only thirteen years old, and he married a sixteen-year-old girl on December 8th. No one from the county, district, or village intervened. This child couple in this village is too young, which has a great impact on their physical development. Should intervention be taken?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zi Ying
　　Answer: If boys and girls have not reached the age for engagement and marriage, and they engage or marry, firstly, their physical development is not mature, and secondly, they do not have the ability to make independent decisions, so restrictions must be imposed. The marriage of Zhao Dahu's thirteen-year-old son and a sixteen-year-old girl, as mentioned in the letter, is not right and the parents of both sides should be patiently persuaded to stop their marriage. If they are already married, the government should deal with it in accordance with the law. Of course, for general marriage issues, emphasis should be placed on pre-emptive education, not on post-event intervention.

专栏：询问与答复

　　男女儿童不应结婚
    问：现在人民政府的政策法令是否对婚姻问题有了变更？男女儿童结婚是否限制？政府是否应干涉？晋县城西十里铺村有一赵大湖，他儿子才十三岁和一个十六岁的女儿于十二月八日结了婚，县区村并无一人干涉，象这村的这一对儿童夫妇年龄尚小，对身体发育有很大的关系，是否应予干涉？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　子英
    答：男女不到订婚、结婚年龄，而行订婚或结婚，一则身体发育还不成熟，二则还没有自主能力，必须加以限制，来信所说赵大湖的儿了十三岁和十六岁的女子结婚，是不对的，应该耐心说服双方家长，劝他们停止他俩的结婚。如果已经结了婚，政府就应依据法令加以处理。当然，一般婚姻问题，应着重事前教育，不要着重于事后的干涉。
