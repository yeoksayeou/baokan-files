Raising the Political Level and Theoretical Ideological Level is the Most Important Task of Literary and Art Workers
　　Xiao San

　　Without a doubt, the main task of literary and art workers is to engage in creation (including writing, performing, painting, etc.). This is their profession, their career. There is also no doubt that, for the sake of creation, they must work hard, must improve their cultural and artistic cultivation, creative skills, and appreciation ability, and must also oppose all unrealistic and contrived creative methods, oppose formalism and naturalism;... But most importantly, they must improve their political and theoretical ideological level.

　　Why is it the most important? There is always a purpose for what you create. Your art, whether you write articles, perform, sing, or paint, always attempts to give the reader, audience, or listener an emotional reaction, an idea. There are no longer any in our ranks who advocate "art for art's sake" or that literature and art are unrelated to politics. Literature and art are subordinate to politics (or serve politics), subordinate to the demands of the times and the people; literature and art have a tendency, an ideology; literature and art educate people and enlighten their thoughts and feelings; there is fundamentally no such thing as "superhuman" or "supra-class" so-called "pure art"—! These are already basic common sense for us.

　　But in practice, we sometimes, even often, become confused and vague. Our way of thinking, viewpoints, and positions are sometimes, even often, not so correct, firm, and sharp. Therefore, some attempts or motivations are originally good, but the effect is the opposite. This is because our political and theoretical ideological level is not high enough.

　　Stalin's remarks at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the importance of political and theoretical ideology for all our work are extremely incisive. Let us read them again:

　　"It should be admitted as an axiom that the higher the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the workers in any country's and party's departments, the higher and richer the work itself, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the workers, the more likely the work is to be fragmented and flawed, and the more likely the workers themselves are to become corrupt and degenerate into selfish and greedy people, and the more likely they are to degenerate. It can be said with certainty that if we can ideologically prepare the cadres of all our working departments and politically train them to such an extent that they can freely decide the direction in the domestic and international environment, if we can cultivate them into fully mature Marxists and Leninists who are good at deciding the issues of leading the country without serious errors, then we can have every reason to believe that nine-tenths of all our problems have been solved."

　　Comrade Mao Zedong also raised this issue very sharply in Chapter 7 of "On the New Stage," he said:

　　"The theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are theories that 'apply to all corners of the world.' It is not to treat their theories as dogmas, but as guides to action. It is not to learn the letters of Marxism-Leninism, but to learn their standpoint and method of observing and solving problems. Only this guide to action, only this standpoint and method, is the science of revolution, is the only correct guideline for guiding us to understand the object of the revolution and guiding the revolutionary movement... Our task is to lead a great nation of 450 million people in an unprecedented historical struggle. Therefore, the task of studying theory universally and deeply is a major problem that urgently needs to be solved and must be focused on in order to be solved. Let us work hard... Our work is done quite well, but if we do not deepen our study of theory, we will not be able to make our work better, and only by making our work better can we have our victory. Therefore, studying theory is a condition for victory. From the point of view of major leadership responsibilities, if China has one hundred to two hundred comrades who have systematically rather than piecemeal, practically rather than emptily, learned Marxism, that will be equivalent to defeating one Japanese imperialism. Comrades, we must study Marxism."

　　These two historical giants have raised the importance of studying theory very highly. Readers please note that they are talking about our work, any work, all work, which naturally includes literary and cultural work. In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Comrade Mao Zedong specifically mentioned the issue of learning, and when he asked literary and art workers to study Marxism-Leninism and learn about society, he clearly stated: "...Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers are no exception."

　　Yes, cultural and literary work is a department of the entire revolutionary work. Lenin said in his "Party Organization and Party Literature": "Literary work should become a part of the entire proletarian cause, a 'cog and screw' of a unified and great social democratic (party) machine." Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "...Literature and art should be made a component part of the entire revolutionary machine," "Proletarian literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat... Revolutionary literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause, it is a screw, and compared with other parts, there is naturally a distinction between importance and urgency, first and second, but it is an indispensable screw for the entire machine, an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause." All comrades who are engaged in Party affairs, political, military, and economic work should study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought. Can comrades who are engaged in cultural and literary work be an exception and not study?

　　Not only can they not be an exception, but we say that, even more, literary and art workers have a greater need to study, understand, and grasp this theoretical ideology. How do we know? Because literature and art are very powerful weapons on the ideological front, literature and art can often give people a very deep spiritual influence, it can often actively, and silently, imperceptibly, penetrate into all aspects of social life, and it can play a subtle role in people. Literature and art is to give people ideological education, it is very capable of influencing people's political life.

　　Regarding this, Comrade Mao Zedong said it most clearly, he said: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but in turn give great influence to politics" ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art").

　　He also said:

　　"Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon of revolution for the masses of the people. Revolutionary culture is the ideological preparation for the revolution before the revolution; in the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the overall revolutionary front, and revolutionary cultural workers are commanders at all levels on this cultural front. 'Without revolutionary theory, there is no revolutionary movement,' which shows the importance of the revolutionary cultural movement to the revolutionary practice movement" ("On New Democracy," emphasis added by the translator).

　　Since cultural and literary workers are commanders on the revolutionary ideological front, since "writers are engineers of the human soul (spirit)" (Stalin), since their responsibility is so great, how can they not establish their own correct, progressive, and revolutionary outlook on life and the world? And to establish such an outlook on life and the world, how can they not improve their political and theoretical ideological level? There is a Russian saying: "What is written with a pen cannot be chopped off with an axe." If you do not have a good political and theoretical ideological level, if you do not seriously and solemnly do this "ideological preparation," are you not afraid that what you write will waste people's precious time, and even give people a bad influence, what is called misleading the people and poisoning the future?

　　Of course, revolutionary theory is not a dogma but a guide to action. In the past, during the rectification period, we emphasized anti-dogmatism, which was right, because dogmatism greatly poisoned our revolution. But some people, in order to oppose dogmatism, opposed all theory, which is very wrong.

　　After opposing dogmatism, many comrades did not dare to put a single theoretical book on their desks. If anyone quoted a few words from Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, or even Comrade Mao Zedong, they would be considered... dogmatism. Do you find such a fact ridiculous? But it did happen. Such comrades despise learning, despise studying Marxist-Leninist theory, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Party's policies. Such comrades have great blindness in their thinking, cannot specifically analyze things when they encounter them, stand firm, grasp policies, and independently solve problems, "freely decide the direction," but only follow the trend: the wind blows to the left, and they go to the left, and the wind blows to the right, and they go to the right. Such comrades often fall into the quagmire of pragmatism and empiricism in their daily and practical work. Literary and art workers with this problem will write about whatever they see, and will only see the one-sided, individual, and partial, but not the comprehensive, the whole, the large and the universal, and especially not see the development of people and things. Such literary and art workers either are complacent with their one-sided understanding, satisfied with their nearsightedness, or use their own colored glasses to look at everything, and think that everything is that color, or indulge in their own fragile and small feelings, and use it to feel and describe everything, or are confined to their narrow bits and pieces of experience, thinking that everything is their set, and use their set to create. Such literary and art workers cannot distinguish that the exposure of the ugliness of landlords, bureaucrats, and capitalists and the criticism of certain shortcomings of the masses of the people should be two completely different attitudes and intentions. He describes the individual shortcomings within the revolutionary front vividly and prominently, but forgets that these are shortcomings in development and progress, because he simply does not recognize that this is development and progress, so when he describes it, it is dull and lackluster. Such literary and art workers describe the things left over from the old society and the villains vividly; they always describe the new society and new people, and the upright characters, unlike them, because they are not familiar with them in normal times, and they have no enthusiasm when writing. Such literary and art workers also describe the "leftist" errors in a certain period of land reform and the various deviations in our other work vividly, without analysis, or blindly praise them, without any criticism; or completely deny them and write them as if there is nothing good about them. And they do not criticize or prevent the right-leaning when correcting the "leftist" deviation. Such comrades, such literary and art workers are like drunken people, "propping them up to the east and they fall to the west," in short, because their political and theoretical ideological level is not high enough, they cannot grasp the policies well, and they cannot adhere to the truth and be ready to correct mistakes in politics, so their creations are only one-sided, individual, accidental, "every word recorded," impressionistic, or impressionistic, rather than rich in positive educational significance and function. His creation cannot be typical, real, and universal, but distorted and wrong. How can such literary and art workers be commanders on the ideological and cultural front and engineers of the human spirit? How can they rely on their creations to give great influence to politics?

　　You must never think that a "flash of inspiration" or some emotional stimulus can produce valuable works. Nor should you ever think that you can create successfully as long as you have skills. Inspiration or literary talent is there and is needed, emotion or enthusiasm, skills and some degree of proficiency are also very needed—without inspiration, you cannot write articles, what is written without emotion cannot move people, and what is written without skills does not look like anything. But inspiration and emotion must go through thought and reason before they are not blind, spontaneous, and primitive, and skills must also be used in that aspect and must be attached to thought before they are not carved and contrived. "Art without thought is like a man without a soul - a corpse" (Belinsky). What is created by skills, etc., can only be semi-finished products at best, and such artists can only be called half artists at best. (Gorky's speech at the Moscow Congress of Art Workers). Conversely, a literary and art worker with thought and reason, his emotions will be proper and more enthusiastic and great, his literary talent will be richer and deeper, and his skills will be used more appropriately and more skillfully - yes! If the ideology is very bad, but the skills are very high, then it will give people more and deeper toxins, and such skills will become a crime. Look, a person with thought and learning, any of his remarks are reasonable and valuable. If the thought is cleared, then everything can be solved easily, and you can be at ease and swim freely. That is a vast and boundless world! That is a free and happy world! What is squeezed out of a healthy body is always blood rather than water, the blood in a sick body is inevitably unclear, and what is squeezed out of a sore is pus, which is toxin!

　　The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the two magazines "Star" and "Leningrad," the decision on the program of theatrical performances, the decision on the second part of the film "The Great Life," the decision on the opera "The Great Friendship," and Zhdanov's report on the above two literary magazines, as well as the open and bold criticism of certain creations in the Soviet literary and art circles in recent years, have repeatedly raised the importance of the ideological, principled, class, and party nature of literary and artistic creation, severely criticizing the harmfulness of works without thought, without principles, with wrong ideas, or with decadent ideas, and works that are divorced from politics - all these, as well as the philosophical discussions, economic discussions, and biological discussions recommended by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, can and should be used as our mirror, and our literary and art worker comrades can and should study and research them well. I will not add more quotations here.

　　Lenin's article "Party Organization and Party Literature" is worth rereading and strengthening the study of the most progressive and revolutionary theory in ancient and modern China and abroad - the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and strengthening the study of the thought of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution - Mao Zedong Thought, is the most basic and only method and road for our literary and art workers to improve their political and theoretical ideological level.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's cultural and artistic thought, the most clear, complete, and concrete exposition, is his famous works "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." That is the most popular and yet most profound and thoughtful brilliant explanation and development of Marxism-Leninism on cultural and artistic issues. He gave us the direction of literature and art for workers, peasants, and soldiers, for the masses of the people, and also gave the concrete outline of how to do it. Our literary and art worker comrades must repeatedly and carefully study those few works, and if we have done so, if we have a love for Marxist-Leninist theory, then we can well understand Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and we can smoothly solve all the problems about literary and artistic work, and we will not feel hesitant, depressed in our work, and some even want to change careers.

　　The talk has been long, let us end with a few words. There is no doubt that literary and art workers should mainly create, our creations are too few, too weak, and too unable to keep up with reality, we must greatly exert ourselves. But it is precisely in order to strengthen creation that we must strengthen the study of theory. From studying and mastering Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, we can obtain and strengthen the power of creation.

　　"The power of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to enable the Party to find correct guidance in any situation, understand the internal connections of current events, predict the course of events, and know not only how they are developing and in what direction they are developing at present, but also how they will inevitably develop and in what direction they will develop in the future."

　　Stalin's words are really too good for our literary and art workers who use new realism (socialist realism or proletarian realism) as a method of creation.

　　At this North China Literary and Art Work Conference, many issues were touched upon—such as the issue of literary and artistic creation lagging behind reality, the relationship between popularization and improvement, the issue of writing form, the issue of scale and standards, the issue of the combination of writers and practice, the issue of literary and artistic criticism, etc. Some comrades said it right, all these issues have already been resolved in Chairman Mao's "Talks." It has already been resolved, but it is still a problem now, which proves once again that Chairman Mao's speech needs to be reread and studied carefully; it proves once again that raising the political and theoretical ideological level of literary and art workers is a very important task. At that meeting, because of the limitation of time and health, I was not able to explain these ideas more thoughtfully, and the meeting did not particularly emphasize this issue, so I will add a slight extension here, as a supplement to that talk, and publish it in this journal so that I can discuss it with more comrades. If there is anything inappropriate, please correct me. (Reprinted from North China Literature and Art, Issue 1)

### 提高政治水平、理论思想水平是文艺工作者最重要的任务

　　提高政治水平、理论思想水平是文艺工作者最重要的任务
    萧三
    没有疑问，文艺工作者的主要任务是搞创作（包括写作、演出、绘画等）。这是他的本行，他的事业。也没有疑问，为了创作，他必须下苦工夫，必须提高自己的文化、艺术修养、创作技巧、欣赏能力，也必须反对一切不真实的与矫揉造作的创作方法，反对形式主义与自然主义；……但是最重要的，必须提高自己的政治理论思想水平。
    为什么最重要呢？你创作一种什么，总有一个目的。你的艺术，你写文章、演、唱或绘画，总是企图给读者、观众或听众以一种情感上的反应，以一种思想。我们队伍里现在再没有主张“为艺术而艺术”或文艺与政治无关的了。文艺是服从于政治（或为政治服务）服从于时代与人民群众的要求的；文艺是有倾向性、思想性的；文艺是教育人、启发人的思想感情的；世间根本就没有什么“超人的”“超阶级的”所谓“纯文艺”—！这些对于我们已是初步常识了。
    但是在实践中，我们有时甚至常常还会迷惑模糊起来。我们的思想方法、观点、立场，有时甚至常常还不是那样正确、坚定、尖锐。因此有的企图或动机本来是好的，但效果适得其反。这就是我们的政治理论思想水平还不够高的缘故了。
    政治理论思想水平对于我们一切工作的重要，斯大林在联共十八次大会上讲的一段话可说是精辟极了，让我们再来读读：
    “应该承认，这是一个公理，任何国家的和党的工作部门底工作人员，他们的政治水平与马列主义的觉悟（意识）愈高，那么工作本身就愈高和愈丰富，工作的结果就愈有效，相反，——工作人员底政治水平与马列主义的觉悟愈低，那么工作就愈可能破碎与有缺陷，工作人员自己就愈可能腐化与坠落为自私自利者、贪吝者，他们愈可能退化。可以肯定地说，假如我们能够在思想上准备我们一切工作部门的干部及在政治上锻炼他们到这样的程度，即他们在国内和国际环境的当中能够自由地决定方向，假如我们能够造就他们成为完全成熟的马克思、列宁主义者，善于决定领导国家的问题而没有严重的错误，——那么我们就可以有一切根据，认为我们所有问题的十分之九是已经解决了”。
    毛泽东同志在“论新阶段”第七章对这问题也提得非常尖锐，他说：
    “马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，是‘放之四海而皆准’的理论。不是把他们的理论当作教条看，而是当作行动的指南。不是学习马克思列宁主义的字母，而是学习他们观察问题与解决问题的立场与方法。只有这个行动指南，只有这个立场与方法，才是革命的科学，才是引导我们认识革命对象与指导革命运动的唯一正确的方针……我们的任务，是在领导一个四万万五千万人口的大民族，进行着空前的历史斗争。所以普遍地深入地研究理论的任务，对于我们，是一个亟待解决并须着重致力才能解决的大问题。我们努力吧……我们的工作做得还不错，但如果不加深一步地学习理论，就无法使我们的工作做得更好一些，而只有使我们的工作做得更好一些，才有我们的胜利。因此，学习理论是胜利的条件。在主要领导责任的观点上说，如果中国有一百个至二百个系统地而不是零碎地，实际地而不是空洞地学会了马克思主义的同志，那将是等于打倒一个日本帝国主义。同志们，我们一定要学习马克思主义”。
    这两位历史的巨人对于学习理论的重要可谓是提得很高了。读者请注意，他们讲的是我们的、任何工作、一切工作、那自然也包括文艺、文化工作在内。在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话里，毛泽东同志特别提到学习问题，要文艺工作者学习马列主义和学习社会时，就明白地说了：“……马列主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外”。
    是呵，文化文艺工作是整个革命工作的一个部门。列宁在他著的“党的组织和党的文学”里就说了：“文学事业应当成为整个无产阶级事业的一部分，一个统一的、伟大的社会民主（党）的机械的“齿轮和螺丝钉”。毛泽东同志也说了：“……要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分”，“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分……革命文艺是整个革命事业的一部分，是螺丝钉，与别的部分比较起来，自然有轻重缓急第一第二之分，但它是对于整个机器不可缺少的螺丝钉，对于革命事业不可缺少的一部分”。一切我们作党务、政治、军事、经济工作的同志都应该学习马列主义理论，学习毛泽东思想，难道作文化文艺工作的同志就能例外地不要学？
    岂但不能例外，我们说，更有进者，文艺工作者更加有学习、领会、掌握这个理论思想之必要。怎见得？因为文艺是思想战线上非常有力的武器，文艺常能给人以很深的精神上的影响，它常能积极地，而且是不声不响，不知不觉地打入社会生活的一切方面的，它对人能起一种潜移默化的作用。文艺就是给人以思想的教育的，就是很能影响于人的政治生活的。
    关于这，又是毛泽东同志说得最明确，他说：“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转过来给伟大影响于政治”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）。
    他又说了：
    “革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中一条必要与重要的战线，而革命的文化工作者，就是这个文化战线上的各级指挥官。‘没有革命的理论，就没有革命的运动’，可见革命的文化运动对于革命的实践运动具有何等的重要性”（“新民主主义论”，着重点是引者加的）。
    既然文化文艺工作者是革命思想战线上的指挥官，既然“作家是人类灵魂（精神）底工程师”（斯大林），既然他们的责任有如此之重大，他们自己怎能不建立起自己正确的进步的革命的人生观世界观呢？而要建立这样的人生观世界观，又怎能不提高自己的政治理论思想水平呢？俄国有句成语：“用笔写出来的东西，用斧子也砍不掉”。你没有很好的政治理论思想水平，你没有认真严肃地作这个“思想准备”，你不怕你写出来的东西将浪费人们宝贵的时间，甚至给人们以不良的影响，所谓误尽苍生和流毒无穷吗？
    自然，革命的理论不是教条而是行动的指南。过去在整风时期我们强调反教条主义，这是对的，因为教条主义给我们革命的毒害很大。但有的人为了反教条主义而把理论都反掉了，这就是非常错误了。
    不少的同志在反教条主义之后，桌子上一本理论书都不敢摆出来了。有谁引证几句马、恩、列、斯、甚至毛泽东同志的言论，便认为是……教条主义。这样的事实你觉得可笑吗？可是就硬有过。这样的同志就是轻视学习，轻视研究马列主义理论、毛泽东思想和党的政策。这样的同志在思想上有很大的盲目性，遇事不能具体分析，站稳立场，掌握政策，独立地解决问题，“自由地决定方向，而只是跟着一股风走：风往左刮，自己就往左，往右刮自己就往右。这样的同志在日常与实际工作中常陷入事务主义与经验主义的泥坑。文艺工作者有这个毛病就会看到一点便写那一点，就会只看得到片面的、个别的、局部的，看不到全面的、整个的、大量与普遍的，尤其看不到人和事物的发展方面。这样的文艺工作者或则限于片面的认识就矜矜自喜，满足于自己的近视，或对什么都用自己那付颜色眼镜去看，就以为什么都是那个颜色，或则沉溺于自己一种脆弱的、渺小的感情，对什么都用它去感受、描写，或则囿于自己狭隘的一点一滴的经验，认为什么都是他的那一套，并都用他的那一套去创作。这样的文艺工作者分不清对地主官僚资本家丑恶的暴露与对人民大众某些缺点的批评该是完全不同的两种态度，两种用意。他对革命阵线内的个别缺点，描写得淋漓尽致，非常突出，但忘记了这是发展和前进中的缺点，因为他根本不认识这是发展，是前进，于是描写它时，反而暗淡无光。这样的文艺工作者对旧社会遗留下来的事物，对反派人物，描写得形容毕肖；对新社会与新人，对正派人物，总描写得不象，因为平时既不熟悉，写时也无热情。这样的文艺工作者对土改中某时期的左倾错误，对我们其他工作中的各种偏向，也都描写得有声有色，不加分析，或则一味歌颂，毫无批判；或则全部否认写成无一是处。而对纠正“左”的偏向时的右倾，又不加以批判，防止。这样的同志，这样的文艺工作者真是醉人一样，“扶得东来又倒西”总之由于政治理论思想水平的不够高，不能很好地掌握政策，在政治上坚持真理和随时准备修正错误，于是他的创作就只是片面性的，个别偶然性的，“有闻必录”式，感想式，或印象式的，而不是富有积极教育意义与作用的。他的创作就不能是典型的真实的与普遍的，而是歪曲的与错误的。这样的文艺工作者又怎么能作思想文化战线上的指挥官与人类精神的工程师呢？又怎能靠他的创作来给伟大影响于政治呢？
    绝不能以为“灵机一动”，或感情上受了某种刺激就能写出有价值的作品来。也绝不能以为只要有了技巧就可以创作成功。灵机或文思是有的和需要的，感情或热情，技巧及其某种熟练程度也是很需要的——无文思写不出文章来，无感情写出来的东西不能动人，无技巧写不象样。但文思与感情必须经过思想，通过理智，然后才不是盲目的，自发的与原始的，技巧也要看用在那一方面并必须附有思想然后不是雕琢的和矫揉造作的。“艺术而无思想，就如同人而无灵魂——是死尸”（伯林斯基）。凭技巧等等创作出来的东西至多只能是半制品，这样的艺术家至多只能称为半个艺术家。（加里宁在莫斯科艺术工作者大会上演说的大意）反之，有思想与尚理智的文艺工作者，他的感情才会是正当的，和更加热烈而伟大，他的文思才能更加丰富和更加深刻，他的技巧也才会用得更加适当，更加愉快地熟练——是呵！如果思想意识很坏，而技巧却很高，那么它给人们的毒素就更大更深，那样的技巧就成为罪恶。你看吧，一个富有思想和学问的人，他的任何谈吐都有道理，有价值。思想搞通了，就一切都能迎刃而解，左右逢源，游泳自如。那是一片广阔无边的天下！那是一个自由愉快的世界！健康的身躯上挤出来的总是血而不是水，病体上的血就难免不清，有疮处挤出来的就是脓，是毒素！
    联共党中央关于“星”与“列宁格勒”两杂志的决定，关于戏剧上演节目的决定，关于电影“伟大的生活”第二部的决定，关于歌剧“伟大的友情”的决定，和日丹诺夫关于上述两文学杂志的报告，以及苏联文艺界近年来所进行的对某些创作的公开大胆的批评，都再三再四地提出文艺创作的思想性、原则性、阶级性、党性的重要，严厉地指摘无思想、无原则、错误思想或坠落思想及脱离政治的作品之有害——所有这些，以及联共中央所建议举行的哲学讨论、经济学讨论、生物学讨论，都可以和应该作为我们的借镜，我们的文艺工作者同志都可以和应该好好学习研究，在这里不多加引证了。
    列宁的“党的组织与党的文学”一文，值得我们再三精读加强学习古今中外最进步最革命的理论——马克思列宁主义的理论，加强学习马列主义这个普遍真理与中国革命具体实践相结合的思想——毛泽东思想，是我们文艺工作者提高自己政治理论思想水平之最基本与唯一的方法和道路。
    毛泽东同志的文化文艺思想，最明确、完整而具体的阐明，是他的名著之一“新民主主义论”和“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。那是关于文化文艺问题的马列主义之最通俗而又最深刻周到的光辉的说明与发挥。他给了我们文艺为工农兵，为人民大众的方向，而且给了如何为法的具体纲要。我们的文艺工作同志必须再三再四反复仔细研究学习那几个著作，而如果我们是那样做了，如果我们有对于马列主义理论的爱好，那我们就能很好地了解毛泽东同志的文艺思想，就能顺利地解决关于文艺工作的一切问题，就不会在工作中感到彷徨、苦闷，有的甚至想改行了。
    话扯长了，让我们结束几句。没有疑问，文艺工作者主要应该创作，我们的创作太少、太弱了，太赶不上现实了，我们要大大地努一把力。但正是为了加强创作，我们必须加强理论的学习。从学习、掌握马列主义理论、毛泽东思想，可以得到和加强创作的力量。
    “马列主义理论的力量在于它能使党在任何情况下找到正确的指导，了解当前事变的内在联系，预见事变的进程，不仅知道它们在目前如何发展与朝着什么方向发展，而且知道它们在将来必定如何发展与朝着什么方向发展”。
    斯大林的这段话对于我们用新现实主义（社会主义的现实主义或无产阶级的现实主义）为创作方法的文艺工作者，实在是太好了。
    在这次华北文艺工作会议上，触及了许多问题——如文艺创作落后于现实问题，普及与提高的关系问题，写作的形式问题，尺度与标准问题，作家与实际结合的问题，文艺批评的问题等等。有同志说得对，所有这些问题、在毛主席那个“讲话”里都已经解决过了。已经解决了，但现在仍成为问题，那就更一次证明，毛主席那个讲话有重新加以精读与研究之必要；更一次证明，提高文艺工作者的政治理论思想水平是非常重要的任务了。在那次会议上，笔者因为时间和健康的限制，没有能较为周到地说明这些意思，会议也没有特别强调这个问题，现在所以略加引伸一下，作为那次说话的补充，在本刊上发表，以便和更多的同志们商讨。不妥之处，还请读者指正。　　　　　　　　（转载华北文艺第一期）
