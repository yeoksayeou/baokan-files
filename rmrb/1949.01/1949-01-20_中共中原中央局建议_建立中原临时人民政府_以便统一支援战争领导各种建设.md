Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 18th.

The people of the Central Plains Liberated Area, having cleared out most of the enemy and liberated most of the urban and rural areas, urgently need to establish a regional People's Democratic Government to strengthen and unify support for the Liberation War and lead various constructions. To this end, the CCP Central Plains Bureau issued a "Proposal to Convene the Central Plains Provisional People's Representative Conference and Establish the Central Plains Provisional People's Government" to the people of all districts and sectors of the Central Plains on December 10, 1948. The original text is as follows:

One, Since our People's Liberation Army marched into the Central Plains, it has fought heroically and achieved brilliant victories. The enemy in the Central Plains has been largely eliminated, and most of the urban and rural areas have been liberated. The people of the Central Plains have risen up in a timely manner, overthrown the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and rapidly and universally established people's democratic power (including seven major strategic areas: Western Henan, Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Henan-Hubei, Western Anhui, Tongbai, Jianghan, and Southern Shaanxi, with a total of seven administrative offices, thirty-seven commissioner offices, ten municipal governments, and one hundred and ninety county governments). In a very short period, they have supported the war, suppressed bandits and pacified the people, abolished harsh taxes, initially promoted reasonable burdens, rent reduction and interest reduction policies, protected and developed agriculture, industry, and commerce, and effectively managed all cities and transportation. This has united the broad masses of people and embarked on a new period of large-scale construction and social reform. As the Liberation War achieves unprecedented victory, the balance of power between the enemy and us rapidly changes, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang will be fundamentally overthrown and all of China liberated in about a year, the remaining enemies in our Central Plains region will be completely eliminated, the few urban centers along transportation lines have been and are being recovered one by one, and the state of isolation in local areas has been and is disappearing. In order to lead 45 million people to support the war in a unified and organized manner, further develop the national economy, manage regional industries and transportation, and complete the major tasks of large-scale democratic reform and social reform, there is an urgent need to establish a regional supreme people's democratic government that can unify local governments, closely connect with the masses of people, and possess high efficiency. In view of this, the Central Plains Bureau hereby proposes to our Central Plains local democratic governments and people from all walks of life and the People's Liberation Army: to quickly establish a regional supreme people's democratic government.

Two, The Central Plains People's Government will shoulder the great revolutionary task of building a new democratic Central Plains. Therefore, it must be based on broad popular democracy. The government organization must include a broad democratic stratum, with representatives from workers, peasants, urban poor, independent laborers, intellectuals, freelancers, and even the national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, and ethnic minorities. A democratic centralism based People's Representative Conference system must be established. Communist Party members working in the government must practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members on the revolutionary program. The People's Representative Conference should become the highest organ of power of the government. Government committee members and policy programs should be elected and promulgated by the representative assembly. However, because the war has not yet ended, people's organizations are not yet sound, democratic elections are not yet sufficiently thorough, and the democratic system is not yet sufficiently complete, it is suggested that a provisional People's Representative Conference be convened first to elect and establish the Central Plains Provisional People's Democratic Government Committee to meet the urgent needs of the current situation, and to gradually realize more complete and thorough democratic elections and a democratic system in the future. The representatives of the Provisional People's Representative Conference should be produced through four methods: regional elections, professional group elections, ethnic minority elections, and public consultation and appointment. The distribution of quotas and election procedures should be stipulated in separate regulations. If our local democratic governments in various regions, people's organizations, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, business circles, and other democrats and ethnic minority compatriots agree with the above suggestions, it is hoped that the election of representatives will be completed before the official convening of the Provisional People's Representative Conference.

Three, It is suggested that Deng Zihui, one of the heads of the CCP Central Plains Bureau and Deputy Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army Central Plains Military Region, Wu Zhipu, Director of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Administrative Office, Li Yiqing, Director of the Western Henan Administrative Office, Xu Ziwei, Director of the Tongbai Administrative Office, and Liu Zihou, Director of the Henan-Hubei Administrative Office, be elected to form the "Preparatory Committee for the Central Plains Provisional People's Representative Conference" in order to formulate and promulgate the election regulations for the Provisional People's Representative Conference in advance, handle elections and other preparatory matters.

Four, The Central Plains Bureau sincerely hopes that the above suggestions can be given careful consideration and enthusiastic support by the people of the whole region, and that they will be implemented as soon as possible.

　　中共中原中央局建议
  　建立中原临时人民政府
  　以便统一支援战争领导各种建设
    【新华社中原十八日电】肃清了大部敌人、解放了大部城乡的中原解放区人民，亟须建立一个全区性的人民民主政府，以加强与统一支援解放战争及进行各种建设的领导。为此，中共中原中央局特于一九四八年十二月十日向中原各区各界人民发出“召开中原临时人民代表会议，建立中原临时人民政府建议书”。原文如下：
    一、我人民解放军进军中原以来，英勇作战，胜利辉煌，中原敌人已大部肃清，城乡大部解放。中原人民及时奋起，推翻了国民党反动统治，迅速普遍地建立了人民民主政权（计有豫西、豫皖苏、鄂豫、皖西、桐柏、江汉、陕南七个大战略区，共有七个行政公署，三十七个专员公署，十个市政府，一百九十个县政府），并于极短时期内进行了支援战争，剿匪安民，废除苛杂，初步推行合理负担，减租减息政策，保护与发展农工商业，良好地管理了所有城市与交通，从而团结了广大人民，走上大规模进行建设与社会改革的新时期。兹当解放战争空前胜利，敌我力量迅速变化，再过一年左右即可根本上打倒国民党反动统治，解放全中国，我中原地区，残留敌人将被全部肃清，少数交通线城市业已和正在逐一收复，局部地带的隔离状态业已和正在消失之际，为了领导四千五百万人民统一而有组织地进行支援战争，进一步发展国民经济，管理全区性的实业与交通，完成大规模的民主改革与社会改革的重大任务，迫切地需要建立一个能统一各地方政权，密切联系人民大众，并具有高度效能的全区性最高人民民主政府。有鉴于此，中原局特向我中原地方民主政府及各界人民与人民解放军提出建议：迅速建立一个全区性的最高的人民民主政府。
    二、中原人民政府，将负担建设新民主主义新中原的巨大革命任务。因此，它必须建立在广泛的人民民主基础上。在政府组织机构中，必须包括广泛的民主阶层，从工人、农民、城市贫民、独立劳动者、知识分子、自由职业者直到自由资产阶级和开明士绅、少数民族，都应有代表参加，必须建立民主集中制的人民代表会议制度。而在政府中工作的共产党员，必须与党外人士实行在革命纲领上的民主合作。人民代表会议应成为政府最高权力机关。政府委员及施政纲领，应经代表大会选举与制订颁布。但因为战争尚未结束，人民组织尚不健全，民主选举还不可能十分周密，民主制度还不可能十分完备，故建议暂先召开临时的人民代表会议，选举与建立中原临时人民民主政府委员会，以应目前形势之急需，并期将来逐步实现更加完备与周密的民主选举和民主制度。临时人民代表会议代表之产生，应分为区域选举、职业团体选举、少数民族选举、与公议聘选四种，其名额分配与选举手续应另颁条例，具体规定之。我各区地方民主政府、各人民团体、工农兵学商各界以及其他民主人士、少数民族同胞，如赞同上述建议，即望于临时人民代表会议正式召开以前完成代表的选举。
    三、建议推举中共中原中央局负责人之一并兼人民解放军中原军区副政委邓子恢、豫皖苏行政公署主任吴芝圃、豫西行政公署主任李一清、桐柏行政公署主任许子威、鄂豫行政公署主任刘子厚等五人组成“中原临时人民代表会议筹备委员会”，以便事前拟定与颁布临时人民代表会议代表选举条例，办理选举及其他筹备事宜。
    四、中原局深愿上述各种建议能得到全区人民的慎重的考虑，热烈的支持，并早日使之实行。
