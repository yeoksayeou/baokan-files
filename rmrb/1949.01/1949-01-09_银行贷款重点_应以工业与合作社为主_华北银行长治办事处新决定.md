　　Bank Loan Focus
  　Should Be Mainly on Industry and Cooperatives
  　New Decision of the Changzhi Office of the North China Bank
    [Changzhi News] The Changzhi City Office of the North China Bank has concluded its work for November. In the summary, it studied the issue of lending. In the future, it will attach importance to industry (including handicraft industry) and cooperatives and support them. The amount of industrial loans will account for 32.4% of various loans in the future, fully supporting various industrial productions. For example, the Huafeng Iron Factory, the Paper Purchasing Station, and the Liberation Printing Factory have all received such support, overcoming the past phenomenon of emphasizing commerce and neglecting industry.
    The summary pointed out that in the past, support for cooperatives was insufficient. In the future, for genuine cooperatives with a considerable number of people, which organize members' funds and labor to serve the society in order to avoid intermediate exploitation, vigorous support should be given, and a certain amount of loans should be provided to them. It is also noted that loans should not be denied or stopped under the pretext of incorrect business orientation or other shortcomings (shortcomings can be pointed out for transformation). Cooperatives should be united around the state-owned economy.
    There is also a focus on commercial loans. Loans should be based on market needs. For example, continuing to organize public-owned stores and purchasing large quantities of cotton from the western front to sufficiently supply the local market will also play a considerable role in stabilizing prices.　　　　　　　　　　　　(Guo Jinxian)

　　银行贷款重点
  　应以工业与合作社为主
  　华北银行长治办事处新决定
    【长治讯】华北银行长治市办事处，总行结了十一月份工作，在总结里边关于放款问题，做了研究。今后对工业（包括手工业）与合作社要重视起来，加以扶植。工业放款的数量，今后要占各种放款百分之三十二点四，充分的支持各种工业生产，例如华丰铁工厂，纸业采购站、解放印刷厂等，都已得到这样的支持，克服了过去重商业轻工业的现象。
    总结中提出：过去对合作社扶植不够。今后对有相当数量的群众，为避免中间剥削，把社员的资金劳力组织起来，为社会服务的真正合作社，要大力扶植，保持一定数量的贷款贷给他们。并注明不能借口业务方向不对或其他缺点（缺点可以给以提出改造）不给贷款或停止贷款，要把合作社团结到国营经济的周围来。
    在商业放款上也有了重点，放款要根据市场的需要，如继续的组织公营商店，从西线购来大批的棉花，以足够供给本市市场销售，这样对物价平稳上也起着相当的作用。　　　　　　　　　　　　（郭进贤）
