　　Experiences in Rectifying the Militia in Shahe
    Shahe County, Taihang, gained the following experiences in rectifying the militia during the conclusion of land reform: First, resolve the militia's thinking through policy education, combined with solving specific problems. First, make the village cadres understand the policy of ending land reform and thoroughly understand the policy. Then, the village cadres use small meetings, forums, and meal gatherings to conduct propaganda and education among the masses. Armed cadres specifically educate the militia, so that they understand the land reform policy and play a key role in the land reform, which is an important part. On this basis, further understand the ideological problems and specific problems existing in cadres and militiamen, and then clarify each problem among the cadres first, and study solutions. After the ideological knots of the cadres are untied, let them connect with and persuade and educate the militia, and appropriately solve various problems, so that the militia feel that they can reason and feel comfortable. When their thinking is cleared, they will naturally work hard. For example, in Duko Village, the thinking of the Wuwei Committee Director (Party member) was clarified first. He went to persuade and educate the militia every day, and returned the grain and military caps confiscated from the militia by the poor peasant group in the past. The militia happily said: "There is still truth! We must work hard in the future." Second, seize the current facts of sabotage, combined with the vital interests of the militia and the masses, to further improve political and ideological awareness, and achieve organizational restoration. The militia of Shili Ting in the third district, after being educated by the facts of the theft in Chuan Caozhuang, all carried their guns and went out on patrol every night; in Quanhu Village in the second district, a militiaman from the village was sent to the field to watch the autumn harvest and was strangled to death with a rope, as well as facts such as poisoning and theft in the village, let the militia discuss. Everyone unanimously believes that if they do not stand up, the enemy's activities will be even more rampant. They will not only steal things, but also burn our houses and kill us; and on this basis, the militia's political awareness has been further improved, making them realize that the closer Chiang Kai-shek gets to annihilation, the more rampant his sabotage activities against the liberated areas will be. Everyone began to actively defend their own interests. (Pei Zhi)

　　沙河整顿民兵的经验
    太行沙河县在结束土改中整顿民兵，获得几点经验：一、经过政策教育，解决民兵思想，结合解决具体问题。先使村干部了解结束土改的政策，对政策蹬了底，再由村干部利用小会、座谈会、饭场等形式，在群众中进行宣传教育，武装干部专去教育民兵，使其了解土改政策，并在土改中起骨干作用，是重要的一环。在此基础上，进一步具体了解干部民兵所存在的思想问题与具体问题，然后将每个问题先在干部中弄清，研究出解决办法。干部思想疙瘩解开后，让他们去串通与说服教育民兵，并将各种问题恰当解决，使民兵感到能说理，顺了气，思想搞通，自然就会干起来。如渡口村先将武委会主任（党员）的思想弄通，他每天去说服教育民兵，并把过去贫农团没收民兵的粮食与军帽退给民兵，民兵高兴的说：“还有真理呢！今后可得好好干。”二、抓住当前破坏事实，结合民兵群众切身利益，把政治的与思想的觉悟提高一步，达到恢复组织。三区十里亭的民兵，经过川曹庄失盗的事实教育，民兵都背起枪来每夜出去巡查；二区全呼村用本村一个民兵到地看秋，被人用绳子缢死，以及村里发生下毒、偷窃等事实，让民兵进行讨论，大家一致认为：如果自己不起来，敌人活动更厉害，不仅偷东西，还会烧咱房子杀害咱；并在此基础上进一步提高了民兵的政治觉悟，使其认识蒋介石越是接近灭亡，对解放区的破坏活动将越厉害。大家为保卫自己利益开始积极起来。（佩祉）
