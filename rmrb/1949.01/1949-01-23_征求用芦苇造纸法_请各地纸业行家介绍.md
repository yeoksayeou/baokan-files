Seeking Reed Papermaking Methods
  Please Introduce from Paper Industry Experts in Various Regions
    In Xishaocheng and Dayuan Villages, Fourth District, Taiyuan, there have been dozens of handmade paper mills (hemp paper) for many years. Recent surveys show that there are still twenty to thirty remaining. There are thirty-eight "Han Pools" (i.e., papermaking pools), producing approximately 160 districts (each district containing 190 sheets) of Jingwen paper (Chiba paper) daily. Each district of paper requires approximately four catties of raw materials, resulting in a daily requirement of 640 catties of raw materials. These raw materials can only be old rope ends and waste paper scraps. Recently, due to limited sources, coupled with merchants from Linfen and southern Shanxi coming to central Shanxi to purchase, the price of old rope ends has risen from 800 yuan per catty to 1,500 yuan per catty, making raw materials extremely scarce. To solve the problem of papermaking raw materials, some factory members have suggested using reeds for papermaking. The Fourth and Fifth Districts of this county currently have a total of 8,500 mu of reed fields, with each mu producing 200 bundles of reeds. In the past, there was a machine paper mill outside the East Gate of Jinci in this county that used corn stalks, irises, and small reeds as raw materials, and the finished products were very good. However, it is currently unknown whether these raw materials can be used for handmade papermaking, and what the manufacturing methods are. We sincerely hope that paper industry experts from various regions will introduce these methods to promote the development of the paper industry.

### 征求用芦苇造纸法　请各地纸业行家介绍

　　征求用芦苇造纸法
  　请各地纸业行家介绍
    太原四区西邵城、大园两村，历年有数十家手工造纸厂（麻纸）。最近调查尚存有二三十家。有三十八枝“汉池”（即造纸的水池），日产京文纸（尺八纸）约一百六十区（每区一百九十张）。每区纸按四斤原料计算，日需原料六百四十斤。该项原料仅能用旧绳头及废纸片，近来由于来源有限，再加临县及晋南商人来晋中购买，旧绳头由八百元一斤涨至一千五百元一斤，原料异常缺乏。为解决造纸原料，厂方有人提议用芦苇造纸。本县四、五区现共有苇田八千五百亩，每亩能产苇子二百捆。过去本县晋祠东门外，曾有一家机器造纸工厂，用玉茭秆、马莲、小苇子作原料，成品很好；但现在不了解这几种原料是否能用于手工业造纸？其制造法怎样？特望各地纸业行家介绍，以求纸业发达。
