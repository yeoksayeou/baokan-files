　　Heroes,
  　Your Victory is Great
    Front Lines Win Battles, Rear Areas Enthusiastically Support the Army
  　Second Collection of Comfort Letters

Respected Comrades of the Northeast People's Liberation Army:
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the wise command of General Lin Biao, you completely annihilated nearly 500,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits remaining in the Northeast in just one month, liberating the entire Northeast. Recently, your mighty army entered the Shanhaiguan Pass and joined forces with the North China People's Liberation Army. Wherever the army went, it was like a hot knife through butter, capturing cities and annihilating enemies, never shying away from hardship. You truly deserve to be models for the Liberation Army and heroes of the working people!

    Heroes! Your victory is great. It excites and inspires the people of the whole country, and it also excites and inspires all oppressed people around the world to rise up and fight against imperialism and its running dogs with courage and determination. It is indelible; it will be written on the most glorious page of the Chinese revolution and will live forever in everyone's heart.

    Heroes! Continue to work hard and move forward to liberate all of China! I wish you good health!
    　　　　　　　　Shang Zhengfa
