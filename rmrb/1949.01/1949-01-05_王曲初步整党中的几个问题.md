　　Several Issues in the Preliminary Party Rectification in Wangqu

　　Wangqu is a semi-old liberated area village in Yangcheng. It has undergone mass movements of anti-traitor liquidation, rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and leveling the gaps. The Party branch was officially established in February 1947, with a total of twelve Party members, composed of: eight new middle peasants, two old middle peasants, and one well-to-do middle peasant (one rich peasant has been purged in the preliminary Party rectification). This preliminary Party rectification was conducted under the direct leadership of the sub-committee. The progress and issues are as follows:

　　(1) Achievements of Party Rectification

　　In the preliminary Party rectification, Wangqu Party members launched criticism and self-criticism. In the process of criticism and self-criticism, various impure situations within the Party were exposed: for example, class alien elements were discovered in terms of composition; in the land reform, acts of shielding landlords and rich peasants, embezzlement, excessive occupation of fruits, arbitrary beatings, detentions, and random labeling were exposed; in terms of work style, serious commandism was exposed; in terms of development and Party building, it was revealed that individual Party members developed their own families and friends, arbitrarily admitted and expelled members, and the Party lacked democracy, education, and criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, in the process of criticism and self-criticism, activists were discovered who dared to criticize those who persisted in errors at Party meetings. The general mood was relatively high. Activists were also able to start carrying out various activities among the masses. Judging from the above situation, the Party rectification has been successful. Why were these achievements possible? First, the principle of focusing on transformation and education and supplementing with disciplinary sanctions was correctly implemented. Transformation education plus discipline has great power. Every Party member felt that the Party loved them very much. Although they had not worked hard in the past and had made mistakes, the Party still painstakingly educated them and waited for them to become aware. Second, the overall consciousness of all Party members was generally raised during the Party rectification, and activists emerged. Third, before the Party rectification, the work team had a general understanding of the situation in the village and had some basic understanding of the main problems.

　　(2) Shortcomings of Party Rectification

　　First, the political and ideological improvement and education of Party members was still insufficient. For example, the mistakes of shielding landlords and rich peasants and encroaching on fruits were not given profound criticism. It is very important to enhance Party members' understanding and awareness from the actual facts.

　　Second, experienced Party cadres who made mistakes were not subjected to strict criticism. Guo Fusheng, the Party secretary of Xigou, and Guo Youshui, the propaganda officer of Wangqu branch, were both cadres who were seriously detached from the masses. When reforming the leadership composition in Xigou, Guo Fusheng was still allowed to serve as the Party secretary. When adjusting the leadership composition, the work team decided in advance that the Party secretary would not be re-elected; they formally asked the Party members: "Should we change our Party secretary?" The Party members knew from the tone that they were not allowed to move the Party secretary. As a result, only a deputy secretary and two branch committee members were elected. When Xigou disclosed the Party membership, Guo Fusheng was still allowed to report. I asked Comrade Guo Tiancheng of the sub-committee: "If the Party members were allowed to vote, could Guo Fusheng be elected?" Tiancheng said: "He couldn't be elected." Not allowing Party members to democratically elect, restricting Party members' democratic rights, and violating the Party's organizational principles. The same was true for Guo Youshui in Wangqu. If everyone had a good discussion, Guo Youshui might not have been elected. When these people are in leadership positions, righteousness cannot be raised. Why are they so indulgent, violating the Party's organizational principles, and insisting on letting these people lead? Because the leading comrades believe that these people are capable and have the means, and the branch cannot lead without such people. Seeing these people's low morale and shedding a few tears, they soften their hearts and feel that they have gone too far. A stern attitude must be adopted towards these comrades. If they still do not accept the Party's criticism, it is absolutely not allowed. If the leadership does not struggle against these phenomena but instead indulges them, the Party's activists will not emerge, and as a result, the Party will not be rectified well. Therefore, sharp criticism must be carried out, there must be no concessions, criticism must be given when it is due, re-election must be held when it is due, and disciplinary action must be taken when it is due. The Party must be made a proletarian party, a party that serves the masses.

　　Third, they dare not boldly promote truly good Party members to take up the leadership of the branch; they always feel that their abilities are low, they cannot work independently, and they cannot complete the tasks assigned to them. They always lower the conditions and accommodate the old branch committee members who have made mistakes, thinking they are not bad; while they raise the conditions very high for the new ones, thinking they are very poor. This makes it impossible for the new ones to be promoted. In the future, good comrades who have newly emerged must be consciously cultivated and promoted, so that they can become the backbone in the Party, and let Party members recognize who is good and who is bad, and should not always circle around a few responsible cadres.

　　Fourth, they simply checked the shortcomings without pointing out the future direction of each individual and the entire branch. Therefore, there is still a lack of new atmosphere after the Party rectification.

### 王曲初步整党中的几个问题

　　王曲初步整党中的几个问题
    王曲是阳城的半老区村庄，经过反奸清算、减租减息、填平补齐的群众运动。支部是一九四七年二月正式建立起来的，共有党员十二人，成份：新中农八人，老中农二人，富裕中农一人（富农一人初步整党中已清洗。）。这次初步整党是在分委直接领导下进行的，进行情况和问题如下：
    （一）整党成绩
    王曲党员在初步整党中，展开了批评与自我批评；在开展批评与自我批评中，揭发了党内各种不纯的情况：如从成份上发现了阶级异己分子；从土改中揭发了包庇地富、贪污、多占果实、随便打人、扣人、乱戴帽子等坏行为；从作风上揭发了严重的强迫命令作风；从发展与建党上，揭发了党员个人发展自己的家族、朋友，随便吸收随便开除，党内不民主缺乏教育没有批评与自我批评等现象。同时在批评与自我批评中，发现了积极分子，在党的会议上敢向坚持错误的人进行批评；一般的情绪较高。积极分子并能开始在群众中进行各种活动。从以上情况看来，整党是有成绩的。为什么能得到这些成绩呢？第一、正确的贯彻了改造教育为主、纪律制裁为辅的方针。改造教育加上纪律，力量就很大。每个党员感到党对自己很爱护，过去虽然没好好工作，犯了错误，党还是苦心的教育我，还是等待我觉悟。第二、整党中全体党员普遍提高了觉悟，涌现出积极分子；第三、在整党之前工作组掌握了村中的一般情况，对主要问题有了些基本的了解。　　
    （二）整党缺点
    第一、从政治上思想上提高、教育党员还是不够，如对包庇地富，侵占果实等错误不能给以深刻的批评。从实际的事实中提高党员的认识与觉悟是非常重要的。
    第二、对于有经验的党员干部，犯了错误也不进行严格的批评。西沟支书郭福生、王曲支宣郭有水，都是严重脱离群众的干部。西沟在改造领导成份时，仍让郭福生担任支书。在调整领导成份时，工作组事先决定支书不改选；形式的向党员提出：“咱这支书还换不换？”党员一听口气就知道是不让动支书，结果只选了一个副书记，两个支委。西沟公开党时，仍让郭福生报告，我问分委郭天成同志：“如果让党员选时，郭福生能选上么？”天成说：“选不上。”不让党员民主选举，限制党员民主权利，违反党的组织原则。王曲郭有水也是这样，如果好好让大家讨论，郭有水就不一定能选上。这些人居于领导地位，正气就抬不起头来。为什么这样姑息，违反党的组织原则，而硬让这些人领导呢？因领导同志认为这些人有能力、有办法、支部离了这样的人就不能领导。看见这些人情绪不高流几行泪时心就软了，觉着过分了。对这些同志必须采取严正态度。如他还不接受党的批评是决不能容许的。如果领导上不与这些现象进行斗争，反而姑息，就使党内的积极分子涌现不出来，结果党整不好。所以必须进行尖锐的批评，不能让步，该批评即批评，该改选即改选，该处分的就处分。必须使党成为一个无产阶级的党，为群众服务的党。
    第三、不敢大胆的提拔真正好的党员起来担任支部的领导；总觉得他们能力低、单独作不了工作，交给任务完不成。对犯错误的老支部委员，总是降低条件迁就，认为不错；对新的则将条件提得很高，认为很差。这样就使新的提拔不起来。今后对新涌现出来的好同志，要有意识的培养提拔，使他们在党内成为骨干，让党员认清谁是好的，谁是差的，不应一直在几个负责干部身上打圈子。
    第四、单纯的检查缺点，而没有指出今后各个人与整个支部前进的方向。所以整党后尚缺乏新的气象。
