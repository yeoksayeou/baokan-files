Xu Xiuying's Love for the Wounded
    Cheng Shu
    Every wounded soldier of the People's Liberation Army who came from the front and passed through the Dancheng Transit Station in Xuewo (a newly established county, between Yongcheng and Guoyang) was grateful to Xu Xiuying, a cadre of the Women's Federation of that district. She is thirty-eight years old this year and lives in a village near the transit station. When the wounded soldiers were transferred from the front, she would wait by the roadside with a teapot to give them tea, and then follow them to the reception section to help feed them. Sometimes the food was not ready yet and the wounded were hungry, so she would use the money she usually saved by not buying oil to buy things for the wounded to eat. When she heard a seriously wounded soldier moaning, she would always comfort them affectionately to reduce their pain. She quickly collected the bloody and dirty clothes that the wounded soldiers took off and washed them.
    She thought to herself: Supporting the front line cannot be done by one person alone; everyone must be mobilized. She also thought: If you want others to do it, your own family must take the lead. So she first persuaded her husband to participate in the work of the transit station, asking him to fetch water, make tea, and cook for the transit station as soon as it was light, and then clean the houses for the wounded and deliver letters when there were any. Her husband thought she was right, so he did as she said and worked very enthusiastically. She also sent her fourteen-year-old son to take care of the wounded. Then she mobilized all the women in the village to participate in the work of the transit station. They all rushed to do the work she assigned, and even the old women in their fifties and sixties did not lag behind. Everyone was busy washing bloody clothes, making military shoes, and pushing military flour, working from morning till night. Their hands were frozen stiff from washing bloody clothes, but they said, "People are risking their lives and shedding blood at the front, what does it matter if we get a little cold!" Xu Xiuying always led by example in everything she did, washing more than twenty pieces of bloody clothing in half a day. Under her promotion, for the first time, a dozen women washed more than 600 pieces of bloody clothing and made more than 30 pairs of socks in three days. The second time, a dozen women washed two carts and a shoulder-pole full of bloody clothes in one day. Because she took such good care of the wounded, they all had to say goodbye to her before leaving. Those who were literate wrote her name in their notebooks, and those who were illiterate recited her name several times, keeping it firmly in their hearts.
    Xu Xiuying took such good care of the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army because she relied on the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army to gain liberation, and she realized that her interests were inseparable from the People's Liberation Army. She used to be a poor peasant with no house or land and lived a life of hardship. It was not until the local democratic government was established and rent and interest reduction were implemented that she joined the Women's Association and carried out liquidation struggles against the local tyrants and landlords. However, in the autumn of 1946, when the People's Liberation Army moved west, the Kuomintang bandit army returned and implemented a "kill all" policy against the working people who had participated in mass organizations, killing many innocent people. Xu Xiuying had to lead her six young children to flee to other villages and beg for a living. Once when crossing a river, one of her children was drowned. After the county was liberated again, she returned home in April this year. After returning home, she was allocated more than ten mu of land, and she also reclaimed more than ten mu of wasteland herself. Since then, she began to establish her own family business.
    Xu Xiuying has always actively participated in the work of the democratic government. Last autumn, during the conscription campaign in the district, she sent her forty-year-old husband to join the army, but he was not selected because he was old. She then sent her sixteen-year-old son to join the army, but he was also not selected because he was too young. Xu Xiuying was very anxious and finally persuaded one of her relatives to join the People's Liberation Army. Xu Xiuying's husband is a loyal and honest production expert who works silently all day long. During the autumn harvest this year, he cut twenty-five bundles of sorghum ears from his one and a half mu of land. Now, there is no farmer in the Dancheng district who does not know Xu Xiuying's name. [Xinhua News Agency Central Plains, 7th]

　　热爱伤员的许秀英
    程淑
    凡是从前线下来经过雪涡（新设县，在永城、涡阳之间）丹城转运站的解放军伤员，没有一个不感激该区妇女联合会干事许秀英的。她今年三十八岁，家住在靠近转运站的一个村庄。伤员从前方转来时，她就提着茶壶在路旁等候伤员，给伤员喝了茶，再跟到招待股去，帮助给伤员喂饭。有时饭还没作好而伤员又饿，她就把平时不买油而节省下来的钱买东西给伤员吃。她听到重伤员呻吟时，总是亲热地去安慰，使他们减少痛苦。伤员脱下血衣和脏衣服，她很快就收集起来去洗。
    她心里想：支援前线光靠一个人不行，要大家都动起来才好。她又想：要叫别人干，就得自己家里人先下手。于是她先劝丈夫参加转运站的工作，要他天一亮就为转运站打水、烧茶、做饭，然后给伤员打扫房子，有信时送信。她丈夫听她说得很对，就照着她说的作，并且作得很起劲。她又把十四岁的儿子送去照顾伤员。然后她就动员全村妇女，把全村的妇女都动员起来参加了转运站的工作。她分配的活她们都抢着去干，连五、六十岁的老大娘也不落后。大家忙着为伤员洗血衣、做军鞋、推军面，一天忙到晚。洗血衣冻僵了她们的手，大家还说：“人家在前方拼命流血，咱受点凉有啥要紧！”许秀英做什么都以身作则走在前面，她在半天里面洗了血衣二十多件。在她的推动下，头一回，十几个妇女三天洗血衣六百多件，做袜子三十多双，第二回，十几个妇女一天就洗血衣两小车和一挑子。由于她这样爱护伤员，伤员临走时都要向她告别。识字的人，把她的名字写在本子上，不识字的也要把她的名字念几遍，牢牢地记在心里。
    许秀英这样爱护解放军的伤员，是因为她靠共产党和解放军获得了翻身，认识了她的利益和解放军分不开的原故。她以前是没房没地的贫农，过了不少辛酸苦辣的日子。直到当地民主政府建立，实行减租减息时，她才参加了妇女会，向恶霸地主进行清算斗争。但是一九四六年秋天，解放军西调，国民党匪军重来，匪军们对过去参加过群众团体的劳动人民，实行“赶尽杀绝”政策，杀了许多无辜人民。许秀英只得领着六个幼小的孩子逃难他乡，讨饭过日子，有一次过河，她的一个孩子竟被大水淹没了。该县重获解放后，今年四月她才回家，回家后，分得了十几亩地，自己又动手开了十几亩荒地。从此，她才开始建立起自己的家业。
    许秀英对民主政府的工作，一贯是积极地参加。去秋该区进行参军运动时，她曾送四十多岁的丈夫去参军，因为丈夫老了没验上，她又送十六岁的儿子去参军，又因为儿子小了也没有验上。许秀英急的没办法，终于劝她的一个亲戚参加了解放军。许秀英的丈夫是一个忠诚老实的生产能手，终日不声不响的做活，今年秋收时，他的一亩半地砍了二十五捆高粱穗子。现在许秀英的名字在丹城区的农民中是没有一个不知道的。【新华社中原七日电】
