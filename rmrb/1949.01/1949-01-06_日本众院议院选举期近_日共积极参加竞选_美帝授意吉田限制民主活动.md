Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 1st: Reports from various sources: As the date of the Japanese House of Representatives election on January 23rd approaches, a tense campaign movement has unfolded throughout Japan. According to TASS, in this election for 466 members of the House of Representatives, the Japanese Communist Party will nominate one candidate in each electoral district nationwide, totaling 120 candidates. The three major reactionary parties have submitted large lists of candidates. Shigeru Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party has announced its first list of 150 candidates. The Socialist Party is estimated to nominate 200 candidates. Hitoshi Ashida, the former leader of the Democratic Party who was arrested for a major corruption case, will also "campaign from prison." According to the Japan Times, the votes of six million organized workers will greatly influence the outcome of the future election. The Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Organizations, with approximately three million members, has instructed its members to defeat the members of parliament who supported amending the National Public Service Employees Strike Law during the voting. In its instructions, the Federation also told its members to prepare for a new struggle for a minimum wage system and winter allowances. The Japan Farmers' Association, with 1.2 million members, is planning to conduct a vigorous farmer movement during the election campaign.

The reactionary political parties in Japan, especially the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, under the wing of MacArthur, are adding various anti-democratic restrictions to the upcoming election in order to steal votes. According to Reuters, the Japanese government has amended the election law to allow "voting by proxy and voting by mail." This amendment will greatly facilitate the reactionary parties' forgery of votes. The Utsunomiya City Council, north of Tokyo, disregarding the strong opposition from the labor community, has passed a law prohibiting "demonstrations and other inciting expressions" during the election campaign. It is reported that because the Utsunomiya City Council's actions are supported by the occupation forces and the Japanese authorities, other cities and prefectures may formulate similar reactionary measures.

　　日本众院议院选举期近
  　日共积极参加竞选
    美帝授意吉田限制民主活动
    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：随着一月二十三日日本众议院选举日期的逼近，日本全国已展开紧张的竞选运动。据塔斯社消息，在这次众院四百六十六名议员的选举中，日本共产党将在全国每一选区提出一个候选人，即一百二十名候选人，三大反动政党已提出大批的候选人名单。吉田茂的民主自由党，已宣布了第一批一百五十人的候选名单。社会党估计将提出二百名候选人。因大贪污案而被捕的前民主党党魁芦田均，亦将在“狱中竞选”。据日本时报宣称：六百万有组织的工人的选票，必将大为影响未来选举的结果。拥有会员约三百万的日本产业劳动组合联合会，已指令其会员在投票时击败曾支持修改全国公务员罢工法的议员。产联在其指令中同时告诉其会员，准备为最低工资制度及获得冬季津贴而进行新的斗争。拥有会员一百二十万人的日本农民协会，正拟在竞选期间进行猛烈的农民运动。
    在麦克阿瑟卵翼下的日本反动政党，特别是当政的民主自由党，为了窃取选票，正对即将到来的选举增添种种反民主的限制。据路透社消息，日本政府已修改了选举法，准许“他人代为投票及以邮寄方式投票”。这一修改将给反动政党的伪造选票，大开其方便之门。东京以北的宇都宫市市议会，不顾劳工界的强烈反对，已通过了在竞选期间禁止进行“示威游行及其他鼓动表示”的法律。据悉，由于宇都宫市议会的行动系受到占领军及日本当局的支持，其他市县或将制定同样的反动措施。
