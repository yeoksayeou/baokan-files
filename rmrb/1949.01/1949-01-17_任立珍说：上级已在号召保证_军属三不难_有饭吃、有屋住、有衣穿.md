To all comrades of the Northeast People's Liberation Army:

　　Are you tired from marching now? The New Year has arrived, and I extend my respects to you on behalf of all the teachers and students of our school!

　　Since the beginning of the Self-Defense War, comrades, you have fought bravely, sacrificing everything, regardless of wind, rain, hunger, or cold. Now, not a single bandit trace can be found in the Northeast. You have liberated the entire Northeast, protecting the lives and property of the people of the Northeast. People all over the country recognize that without you standing on the front line of the revolution, we cannot live a good life. Especially the people of North China are concerned and looking forward to your rapid entry into the pass, joining the North China People's Liberation Army to liberate all of North China and all of China, and achieve final victory.

　　This time, during the land reform, your families have also received a share of land and property. The higher authorities are calling for guaranteeing the "Three No Difficulties for Military Dependents: Food, Shelter, and Clothing." Cadres at all levels are specifically planning the work of tilling the land on behalf of military dependents. Our teachers and students in various schools are also busy writing New Year's greetings to military dependents, hoping that you will continue your efforts to liberate all of North China and all of China and fight for victory. I wish you

　　A Happy New Year!

  　“军属三不难”
  　有饭吃、有屋住、有衣穿东北人民解放军全体同志们：
    现在你们行军累了吧？新年已经到来，我代表全校师生向你们致敬礼！
    自卫战争开始以来，同志们，不怕风雨，不怕饥寒，牺牲一切英勇地奋斗。现在东北已经搜索不出一个匪迹了，解放了全东北，保障了东北人民的人命财产，全国人民都认识到没有你们站在革命最前线是不能过好日子的。尤其是全华北的人民关怀着，盼望着你们急速进关，和华北人民解放军一同解放全华北全中国，得到最后胜利。
    这次土改你们的家中也分得一份土地，一份财产，上级已在号召保证军属三不难“有饭吃，有屋住，有衣穿，”各级干部正在具体计划军属代耕工作。我们各校师生也忙碌着给军属写新年慰问信，希望你们再接再厉解放全华北全中国胜利奋斗。祝
    新年快乐
