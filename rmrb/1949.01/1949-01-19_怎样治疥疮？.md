To the Editor:
    This semester, many students in our school have contracted scabies. For example, in Senior Grade Two, out of the 34 students who regularly attend classes, 29 have scabies, leaving only five unaffected. The most severe cases are so debilitating that the students cannot even walk. Students like Zhao Weizhuo and Duan Chenghai from this class are completely unable to move due to scabies and have had to return home to rest, which greatly affects their studies. Other students with milder cases are also experiencing some hindrance to their learning. We have tried treatments mentioned in newspapers and folk remedies passed down by word of mouth, but none have been effective. Currently, 87 out of the 245 students in the entire school have contracted scabies, accounting for more than one-third of the total student population, and the problem continues to worsen. Please publish effective methods for treating scabies in the newspaper.

Comrades Wang Yi and others:

    Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by the scabies mite. This mite can be transmitted directly through contact or indirectly through the patient's clothing, bedding, washbasins, towels, and all other utensils. The scabies mite penetrates the epidermis, causing papules that then turn into blisters or pustules, forming winding burrows with black fecal dots inside and a white endpoint deep within. The mite resides in this area. The most common sites are the sides of the fingers, the folds between the fingers, the flexor surface of the wrist joint, the genitals, and the waist. In severe cases, it can spread throughout the body. Once the disease is discovered, efforts must be made to prevent its spread. The best preventive measure is to isolate the patient, and sterilize their belongings by scalding them with boiling water or boiling them. In addition to isolation, patients with scabies must also receive treatment. Any of the following medications can be used for treatment: (1) 20% sulfur ointment; (2) 1% zinc chloride ointment; (3) organic sulfur slow-release preparations (Scabersal, Sulf etc.). The method of use is to apply the medication, then bathe and change into clean clothes. Repeat this process daily for several days to achieve results. Another effective and economical method is simple to use and more suitable for group application. Students at Third High School can try using this method. This method involves boiling one catty of sulfur, two catties of stone coal, and twenty catties of water in a pot. After it is completely dissolved, remove the lower layer of cloudy residue and use the clear water to rub on the scabies. Mild cases can be cured with one application, while severe cases may require several applications. The medicine can be prepared in larger or smaller quantities according to this ratio. This medicine is strongly irritating and should not be applied for too long each time.

　　怎样治疥疮？编辑同志：
    这学期我们学校学生生疥疮的很多，如象高二班，经常上课的有三十四个学生，其中就有二十九个人都生了疥疮，其除只剩下五个人没有，最严重的害得连路都不能走。如这班赵维绰、段成孩等学生，疥疮害的完全不能行动，只好回家去休养，这样对学习影响很大。其余害得稍轻些的学生，也有些妨碍学习，曾采用了报纸上介绍的和群众口传的单方治疗过，结果都不见效。根据全校二百四十五名学生中，现已有八十七个生上了疥疮，此数已占全校学生总数的三分之一强，还在继续不断的发展，请报纸上介绍出治疗疥疮的有效办法。

    王毅等四同志：
    疥疮是一种能传染的皮肤病，病原体为疥癣虫，此虫可直接由接触传染，或经病人之衣服、被褥、脸盆、手巾及一切用具而传染之。疥虫由表皮侵入，而生丘疹，然后变成水泡或脓泡，作一二＠之＠道，＠道内有黑色之粪点，其终点深在而呈白色。虫即栖于该部。其好发部位，如指之两侧，指间皱襞，腕关节之屈面，阴部以及腰部，重者则蔓及全身。发现此病后，须力求预防。预防法最好是把病人隔离，他所用的东西用开水烫或用水煮过。对已患疥者于隔离之外，尚须治疗，其治疗法，用以下各药均可：即（一）百分之二十硫磺软膏；（二）百分之一爹儿氯化锌软膏；（三）有机硫磺慢制剂（斯加伯尔·撒尔肤等）。其用法即用药涂擦后，洗澡换清洁的衣服。每大施行，连续数日即可奏效。另外尚有一个有效且节俭的办法，用法简便，更适合于团体行之，三高同学可试验采用此法。这方法即用一斤硫磺，二斤石炭，二十斤水放在锅中煮之，待全溶化后去其下层混浊渣，而用其清水擦抹疥疮，轻者一次可愈，重者有几次可愈。药的配法可按此比例多配少配均可，此药刺激性强，每次不可涂擦过久。
