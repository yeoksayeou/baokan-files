　　Organizing a Southeast Asian Counter-Revolutionary Bloc
　　Nehru Willing to be a Lackey of the American Imperialists, and Has Encountered Resistance from the Indian People
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th – The so-called "Asian Conference" convened by Indian Prime Minister Nehru under the direction of the United States, opened in New Delhi on the 20th. In his opening speech, Nehru himself exposed his true colors as a lackey working for his American masters to organize a counter-revolutionary bloc. Although he still hypocritically claimed: "The primary purpose of this Asian Conference is to resolve the Indonesian issue," he revealed his true intentions by saying: "However, Asian countries must consider completing permanent measures so that they can effectively consult each other, work together, and seek common goals." He then blatantly proposed to the reactionary representatives of the attending countries the establishment of a so-called "institution" against the Asian people. Earlier, at a press conference in Calcutta on the 13th, Nehru had already revealed the anti-Asian people nature of the "institution" he proposed to establish, pointing out that the "Asian Conference" is "not anti-Europe, not anti-America, and not anti-Western countries" (Indian News Service). Nehru's proposal in his opening speech was immediately enthusiastically supported by the puppet of American imperialism—the Philippine representative. In his speech following Nehru's, Philippine representative Romulo strongly urged the attending countries to establish a "permanent institution" "to safeguard the Far East and resist Communism" (United Press). When Romulo arrived in New Delhi from the Philippines on the 18th, he revealed to reporters that the proposed "Eastern Bloc" by the Philippines (America) and India is similar to the "Western Alliance," "Pan-American Group," and "Atlantic Alliance."
    The Indian government's service to the imperialist camp has been applauded by the American reactionaries. On the 16th, U.S. Ambassador to India Henderson boasted that the Asian Conference "will produce constructive effects" and encouraged "the United States and India to work side by side" (Indian News Service).
    However, the Nehru government's anti-people actions are being resisted by the Indian people. Two days before the opening of the "Asian Conference" (the 18th), a demonstration led by the Indian Student Federation took place in Calcutta. As a result of police suppression, it caused serious disturbances, with gunfire and explosions continuing into the night (Reuters). Even earlier, in early this month, the Nehru government was severely protested by the All-India Student Federation for beating thirteen students in Bombay who were demonstrating against the Dutch. The International Student Union also protested to the Nehru government for this and sent a telegram to support the thirteen injured students.

　　筹组东南亚反革命集团
  　尼赫鲁甘充美帝走卒已遭到印度人民反抗
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】在美国指使下由印度总理尼赫鲁召集的所谓“亚洲会议”，已于二十日在新德里开幕。尼赫鲁在开幕词中，自己暴露了他替美国主人奔走组织反革命集团的真面目。他虽仍虚伪地宣称：“此次亚洲会议之首一目的，乃在解决印尼问题”，但却露出了马脚地说：“然而亚洲国家必须考虑完成永久措施，以便能互作有效咨商，一致努力，寻求共同目的。”接着他就露骨地向到会各国的反动代表提出了建立反对亚洲人民的所谓“机构”。而早在这次会议以前，尼赫鲁十三日在加尔各答记者招待会上，即已透露他提议建立之“机构”的反亚洲人民的性质，他指出“亚洲会议”是“不反欧、不反美、不反西方国家”的（印度新闻处）。尼赫鲁在开幕词中的建议，立即得到美帝国主义的傀儡——菲律宾代表的热烈支持。菲代表罗慕洛在继尼赫鲁的发言中，力促到会各国建立“永久性机构”，“以保障远东，抵御共产主义”（合众社）。罗慕洛于十八日由菲抵新德里时，即曾向记者披露，菲（美）印拟议中的“东方集团”，与“西方联盟”、“泛美集团”、“大西洋联盟”等类同。
    印度政府为帝国主义阵营的效劳，受到美国反动派的喝采。十六日，美驻印大使汉德逊夸耀亚洲会议“将产生建设性的效果”，并勉“美印两国能并肩努力”（印度新闻处）。
    可是，尼赫鲁政府的反人民行动，正遭到印度人民的反抗。“亚洲会议”开幕前两天（十八日），加尔各答发生了印度学联领导的示威游行。由于警察弹压结果，曾引起严重骚动，枪声与爆炸声入夜不息（路透社）。更早一些，在本月上旬，尼赫鲁政府曾因毒打十三名孟买反荷示威的学生而遭到全印学联的严重抗议。国际学联亦为此向尼赫鲁政府提出抗议，并通电声援负伤之十三学生。
