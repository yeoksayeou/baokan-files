Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. TASS, Moscow, 4th: Malinin commented in *Pravda* on the U.S.-British-French Ruhr agreement, stating: The agreement concluded at the London Splinter Conference is undoubtedly part of the so-called "Occupation Statute" that the United States stubbornly attempts to impose on West Germany.

The uproar surrounding the supposed "spirit of concession" that U.S. and British diplomats are said to have shown to the French side has only one purpose: to deceive French public opinion and provide the current rulers of France with arguments to force the French people to accept the enslaving Ruhr agreement, which will seriously endanger the security of France and Europe.

The essence of the American plan for the Ruhr is to prevent any country other than the United States and Britain from controlling Ruhr industry. With this aim, the United States forced the participants of the first London Splinter Conference to pass a resolution stipulating that international control over the Ruhr should be limited only to the distribution of finished products, and not involve production issues at all. This resolution means that the United States is seizing the war and industrial potential of the Ruhr. U.S. monopoly capital has close ties with the Ruhr magnates and has agreed: the more dollars they get, the more docile they will be.

Do these resolutions passed by the Second London Splinter Conference change in any way the principle that the Ruhr industrial production is entirely controlled by Wall Street merchants and their British cronies? Absolutely not. The "control groups" composed of the U.S. and Britain, including the heads of the Ruhr coal and steel industries, have unlimited power. The establishment of the so-called Ruhr "International Control Authority," which the U.S. and British newspapers are heavily promoting, does not affect these "control groups" at all. Even if French representatives are allowed to participate in the "control groups," they will only be in the position of poor relatives, unable to have any significant influence. As for the "Control Authority," it is composed of those who always guarantee the necessary majority to the U.S. and British sides.

The resolutions of the London Splinter Conference stipulate that, in addition to the "International Control Authority," a so-called "Military Security Board" should also be established. However, the power of this bureau is deliberately undefined and stipulated very vaguely. But no matter how it is publicized, this "Military Security Board" is by no means to prevent the revenge threats of the Ruhr magnates. The future activities of the bureau have other purposes. According to the intentions of its founders, the Ruhr magnates will play the role of allies, supporting the U.S. and British policy aimed at turning the Ruhr into a base for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

The resolutions of the London Splinter Conference have dealt a heavy blow to the interests of the German people because the purpose of this resolution is to consolidate the division of Germany. This resolution also undermines the basic interests of European security, it stabilizes the occupation system in Europe, transforms the Ruhr into a U.S. war and industrial base, and establishes the prerequisites for the resurgence of German aggression.

The illegal resolutions of this splinter conference have no effect of international agreement because it violates the basic interests of the European people and the interests of peace and security.

　　马里宁评“鲁尔协定”
  　美帝攫夺鲁尔工业危害欧洲安全和平
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：马里宁在真理报上撰文评论美英法鲁尔协定称：伦敦分裂会议中所缔结的协定，无疑是美国固执地试图强加于西德的所谓“占领法规”的组成部分。
    围绕着假想的、据说是美英外交家曾向法方表现的“让步精神”而发的喧嚣，只有一个目的，即欺骗法国舆论，给法国目前的统治者提供论据，以便强使法国人民接受会严重危害法国与欧洲安全的奴役性的鲁尔协定。
    美国对鲁尔计划的实质，乃是阻止美英以外的任何国家管制鲁尔工业。怀着这一目的，美国强迫第一次伦敦分裂会议的参加者通过决议，规定对鲁尔的国际管制仅仅限于生产品的分配，而完全不涉及生产问题。这一决议意味着美国攫夺鲁尔战争和工业的潜在力。美国独占资本与鲁尔大亨们有密切联系，并约定：给他们以更多的美元，他们就更加驯服。
    伦敦第二次分裂会议所通过的这些决议，是否使鲁尔工业生产完全由华尔街商人及其英国伙计支配的原则路线有任何改变呢？绝对没有。美英所组成的包括鲁尔煤业和钢业头子在内的“管制团”，其权力是无限的。美英报纸大事铺张地宣传的这个所谓鲁尔“国际管制局”的设立，毫不影响这些“管制团”。法国代表即使被准许参加“管制团”，他将只是处于穷亲戚的地位，不能有任何重要的影响。至于“管制局”，则是由那些总是给美英方面保证必需的大多数的人组成的。
    伦敦分裂会议的决议规定：除了“国际管制局”以外，还设立了一个所谓“军事安全局”，可是，该局的权力故意不予确定，规定得非常含混。但不论如何宣传，这个“军事安全局”却决不是为了防止鲁尔大亨们的报复威胁。该局未来的活动另有目的。按其创始者的意图，鲁尔大亨们将扮演盟友的角色，支持美英旨在变鲁尔为侵略苏联及人民民主国家的基地之政策。
    伦敦分裂会议的决议，沉重地打击了德国人民的利益，因为这个决议的目的是巩固德国的分裂。这个决议同时也损害欧洲安全的基本利益，它稳定欧洲的占领制度，变鲁尔为美国的战争与工业基地，并建立德国侵略再起的前提。
    该项分裂会议的非法决议，完全没有国际协定的效力，因为它违背欧洲人民的基本利益及和平与安全的利益。
