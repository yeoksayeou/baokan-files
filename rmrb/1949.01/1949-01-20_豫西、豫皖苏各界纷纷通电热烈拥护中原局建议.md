Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 18th. Since the Central Plains Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Proposal on Convening the Central Plains Provisional People's Representative Conference and Establishing the Central Plains Provisional People's Government" on December 10th of last year, it has immediately gained enthusiastic support from the broad masses of people in the Central Plains. According to statistics from New Year's Day, over twenty telegrams have been received from more than fifty organizations and groups representing the people of various regions in Western Henan, Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other places, unanimously supporting the Central Plains Bureau's proposal and agreeing that Deng Zihui, Wu Zhipu, Li Yiqing, Xu Ziwei, Liu Zihou, and other five persons should form the Preparatory Committee for the Central Plains People's Provisional Representative Conference, responsible for planning and convening the Central Plains People's Provisional Representative Conference and promoting the early establishment of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government. The joint telegram from the Western Henan District Party Committee, the Western Henan Military Region, and the Western Henan Administrative Office stated: "After one year and three months of heroic and arduous struggle, the Western Henan Liberated Area has eliminated and disintegrated nearly 40,000 bandits, greatly developed the military region's revolutionary armed forces, established democratic governments in 48 counties and cities, rescued 12 million people in the entire district, and has begun systematic and planned democratic movements and social construction. The people of Western Henan deeply feel that in this increasingly consolidated and unified Central Plains region, it is necessary to quickly establish a unified people's regime to lead us in continuing to liberate the entire Central Plains and liberate the entire China." The telegram from the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military Region, after elaborating on the impact of the Huaihai Campaign victory, stated: "The entire Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu region will soon be completely liberated. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a unified people's regime in the entire Central Plains to develop the higher revolutionary interests of the people in the entire Central Plains and turn the vast and rich plains between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers into a solid strategic base for the continued southward development of the Chinese revolution." The Zhengzhou City Workers' Preparatory Committee said in a telegram: "This proposal is a timely and wise proposition, which is entirely in line with the interests of the working class and all democratic classes in the Central Plains." The telegram continued: "In order to fundamentally overthrow the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in about a year, it is necessary to unify the power of the regime, closely connect with the masses, vigorously support the front lines, and carry out large-scale democratic construction and social reform." The Joint Administration Bureau of the Longhai-Pinghan Railway Workers' Committee, all employees of the Zhengzhou Branch of the Western Henan Highway Bureau, and the Zhengzhou Post Office Workers' Preparatory Committee, among others, voluntarily proposed in telegrams to increase working hours, improve work efficiency, actively build railways, highways, and postal services, strengthen transportation, and vigorously support the front lines in response to the call of the Central Plains Bureau. Mass organizations such as farmers, youth, women, and merchants in various places, in addition to sending telegrams to support the above proposals, also expressed that they will take practical actions to promote the early establishment of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government.

　　豫西、豫皖苏各界纷纷通电热烈拥护中原局建议
    【新华社中原十八日电】中共中原中央局自去年十二月十日发出“召开中原临时人民代表会议，建立中原临时人民政府建议书”后，立即获得中原广大人民的热烈拥护。据新年元旦日统计，即已先后接获豫西、豫皖苏、郑州、开封、洛阳等地五十余机关、团体代表各区各界人民的通电二十余份，一致赞成中原局的建议，并同意由邓子恢、吴芝圃、李一清、许子威、刘子厚等五人组织中原人民临时代表会议筹备委员会，负责筹划召集中原人民临时代表会议，促进中原临时人民政府早日成立。豫西区党委、豫西军区、豫西行政公署联署的电文称：“豫西解放区经一年三个月的英勇艰苦斗争，业已肃清与瓦解了近四万人的土匪，大大发展了军区革命武装，建立了四十八个县市的民主政府，解救了全区一千二百万人民，并已开始了有系统有计划的民主运动与社会建设。豫西人民深切感到：在这日益巩固统一的中原地区，需要迅速建立统一的人民政权，领导我们为继续解放全中原、解放全中国而战。”豫皖苏军区通电于阐述淮海战役胜利的影响后称：“整个豫皖苏地区即将全部解放，因此，急需建立一个全中原统一的人民政权，发展全中原人民更高的革命利益，把江淮河汉间广大而富饶的平原，变为中国革命继续向南发展的巩固的战略基地。”郑州市职工筹委会在通电中说：“这一建议书是恰合时宜的英明主张，完全符合于中原工人阶级及各民主阶层的利益。”该通电继称：“为着一年左右根本打倒国民党反动派统治，必须统一政权力量，密切联系群众，大力支援前线，进行大模规的民主建设与社会改革。”陇（海）平（汉）铁路联合管理局职工委员会、豫西公路局郑州分局全体职工、郑州邮局职工筹委会等在通电中都自动提出增加工作时间，提高工作效率，积极建设铁路、公路及邮政事业，加强交通运输，有力地支援前线，来响应中原局的号召。各地农民、青年、妇女、商人等群众团体，除通电拥护上述建议外，并表示将以实际行动促进中原临时人民政府的早日成立。
