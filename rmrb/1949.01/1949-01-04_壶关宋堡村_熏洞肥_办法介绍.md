Introducing the "Smoked Cave Fertilizer" Method in Songbao Village, Huguan

    Farmers in Songbao Village, Huguan County, Taihang, use the "smoked cave fertilization method" in winter, solving the difficulty of fertilizer shortage and laying the foundation for next year's production.

    The "smoked cave fertilization method" has many advantages: First, the smoked fertilizer is strong and can kill insects. This is because manure contains a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are the most needed and indispensable nutrients for grains. Applying them to the ground can promote seedling growth and make the grains full. The effects are quickly visible, so farmers enthusiastically call it "hot quick fertilizer." The phosphorus contained in the manure is especially effective in killing pests, especially wireworms, so applying more "cave fertilizer" to the land can reduce pest damage to crops. Second, the by-product of smoking "cave fertilizer"—ash—can be used as a raw material for making saltpeter. During the manure smoking process, saltpeter ash is also produced, which helps military production. Third, smoking requires less material, less effort, and yields more fertilizer. Besides some soil blocks dug up from the ground, the things needed for smoking cave fertilizer are only some firewood, leaves, and rags, which are used to smoke the cave. Using the straw from one mu of land to compost manure can only fertilize half a mu of land; using the same amount to smoke cave fertilizer can fertilize two mu of land. Building a small cave only requires four workdays. Letting women or children smoke it twice every morning and evening, using more than twenty catties of broken firewood each time, will produce more than 320 dan of fertilizer after more than forty days. Smoking a large cave of more than 800 dan only requires more firewood and a few more days of smoking.

    The "smoked cave fertilization method" has so many advantages, and its smoking method is not troublesome. The first step is to build the cave: Select a piece of land and dig up soil blocks. These soil blocks are best if they are loose and porous. Use soil blocks the size of a casserole to build a hollow spherical cave with a diameter of three and a half feet. Leave an opening in the front and back of the cave. Then, with the cave as the center, use soil blocks the size of a bowl to build a large circle. Gradually build it higher and smaller, making it a half-spherical outer shell. Leave two fire mouths one foot four inches high and one foot two inches wide. The fire mouths should be aligned with the small openings left in the cave. Lay flat adobe bricks on the bottom for easy removal of saltpeter ash. When building the outer shell, be sure to fill the space between the cave and the outer shell with soil blocks the size of fists or walnuts. When the outer shell is built more than two feet high, seal it tightly from the outside with wheat bran mud. Building it four or five feet high and capping the top is considered a success. But note that the top cannot be sealed with mud. It must be piled with soil blocks the size of jujubes so that the smoke inside the cave can circulate, but not release a large amount. After the cave is built, put the prepared firewood, leaves... some useless dirty things that need to be burned, into the fire mouths and ignite them twice every morning and evening. Make the firewood only produce smoke without burning flames, and then seal the cave mouths with adobe bricks. The smoke will slowly blacken the surrounding soil blocks through the gaps in the cave. After enough days of smoking, dig open the cave with a hoe, sprinkle with diluted manure or water, and break up the soil blocks. It is best to mix in some corral manure, stir it well, and let it sit for a while. It is most effective for growing crops and nourishing the land.

    This method was created by the Houhai family in Songbao Village. Many years of use have proven that cave fertilizer is much better than ordinary mixed manure. The same one mu of land yields two shi of grain with 60 dan of pig and sheep manure, and can yield more than two shi with 60 dan of "cave fertilizer." Therefore, this winter, more than 50 farm households in Songbao Village have used this method. Everyone said: "The Houhai family's fertilization method is so good! It can not only smoke fertilizer to increase production and improve our lives, but also produce saltpeter ash to make ammunition and overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries, which is a double win."

  　“熏洞肥”办法介绍
    太行壶关县宋堡村农民冬季使用“熏洞积肥法”，解决了缺少肥料的困难，为明年生产打下基础。
    “熏洞积肥法”有很多好处：第一、熏出的肥劲大又能杀虫。这是因为粪中含有大量的氮素磷素和钾素，它们都是五谷最需要和不可缺少的养分，施在地里能发苗又能使颗粒长得饱满，而且很快地就能见到功效，所以农民热心地称它作“热拨粪”。粪中所含磷素，对于杀灭害虫尤其对杀土蚕最为有效，所以地里多施“洞子肥”，能使禾苗少受到虫害。第二、熏“洞子肥”底副产物——火灰，可以作为制硝原料。在熏粪时，同时也生产了硝灰。对军工生产也有帮助。第三、熏时费物少、费力小、得粪多。熏洞子粪所需的东西，除从地里起出的一些土块外，仅只再要些柴草、树叶、破烂布，用来熏洞就行了。用一亩地的禾杆沤粪，仅能上半亩地；同样用来熏洞肥，就能上两亩地。垒一个小洞仅需四个工，每天早晚让妇女或小孩去熏上两次，每次用碎柴草二十多斤四十多天后就能出粪三百二十多担。熏八百多担的大洞，只需多用些柴草，多熏几天就行。
    “熏洞积肥法”有这许多好处，它的熏法也并不麻烦。首先是垒洞：选一块地起出土块，这土块最好是疏松有空隙的，用沙锅大的土块垒一直径三尺半个球形的空心洞肚。洞肚前后各留一口，再以洞肚为心，用碗大的土块垒一大圆圈。逐渐垒高缩小，也使它成为一半球体的外壳。留两个高一尺四寸宽一尺二寸的烧火口，烧火口要对正洞肚所留小口，底要铺上平正的土坯，以便掏硝灰时方便。垒外壳时，随时要在洞肚与外壳间参差填满拳头大核桃大的土块。外壳垒到二尺多高，就要用麦糠泥从外面封严，这样垒四五尺高把顶垒上就算成功了。但要注意顶上不能用泥封，必须堆上红枣大小的土块，使洞内烟气能够流通，但又不大量放出。洞垒成后，每天早晚两次把预备的柴草、树叶……一些无用的要烧掉的脏东西，放进烧火口点燃。要使柴草仅仅发烟而不燃出火苗，然后把洞口用坯封严。烟气就从洞肚中透过空隙慢慢熏黑四周土块。等熏够了日子，就用＠把洞挖开，洒上稀圊肥或水，打碎土块。最好能掺上一些圈粪，搅和后焖一下，上在地里最长庄稼最养地。
    这方法是宋堡村猴孩家创造的。使用了许多年证实了洞子粪比一般杂粪要好的多，同样一亩地施六十担猪羊粪收粮二石，施六十担“洞子粪”就能收两石多。所以今冬宋堡村五十多户农家都使用了这法子，大家说：“猴孩家的积肥法可好啦！既能熏粪增加生产提高自己生活，又能生产硝灰制弹药打倒国民党反动派，真是一举两得。”
