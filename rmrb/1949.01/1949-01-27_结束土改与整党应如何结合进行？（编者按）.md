How Should the Conclusion of Land Reform and Party Rectification Be Combined? (Editor's Note)
    Since late November of last year, the whole region has universally launched the work of Party rectification and concluding land reform. In the Taihang area, villages that have concluded or are in the process of concluding account for about 50% of the total; in the Jizhong area, about 75%; in the Jinan area, over 66%; the Taiyue area is being carried out in three phases, with the first phase completed. Individual counties in the old Jiluyu area are nearing completion, striving to complete the concluding land reform work in the old area before the lunar new year. Judging from the materials from Xingtang and Jingxing counties in the Beiyue area, a county-wide enlarged meeting was also convened in early January to specifically organize the implementation of this task. Cadres in various places mostly went to the countryside around October, and after more than a month of efforts, have extended the movement to the entire region. The achievements of this period are significant. The Party's land reform and Party rectification policies have been understood and accepted by the broad masses, which can be fully demonstrated by the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm currently displayed by farmers. The experience gained in the movement is extremely rich; however, due to the vague understanding of how to combine the two tasks of Party rectification and concluding land reform in the leadership of some areas, and also due to differences in the Party's foundation, Party-masses relations, and the level of mass awareness in various places, some deviations have occurred in guiding ideology and practices in some places. As can be seen from the following materials, the central key to how to combine the conclusion of land reform and Party rectification lies in correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the Party, mobilizing the masses, and raising the awareness of Party members and the masses, and no attitude of indulgence or compromise can be taken towards the mistakes of Party member cadres. We are now publishing a compilation of viewpoints on these issues mentioned in submissions and mimeographed summaries from various places, for the reference of comrades leading this movement.　　　　——Editor
    Taihang Second Prefectural Committee Summarizes Three Types of Experience
  　Implementing Party Rectification in the Conclusion of Land Reform Can Perfectly Resolve Party-Masses Relations
    The Taihang Second Prefectural Committee convened a county secretary meeting to discuss and inspect land reform and Party rectification work. Comrades at the meeting unanimously clarified that Party rectification must be combined with the conclusion of land reform at the same time. The two do not hinder each other, but promote each other; they do not prolong the time, but can shorten the time. At the same time, only by correctly combining them can the goals of concluding land reform and Party rectification be perfectly achieved. The meeting made the following assessment of the concluding land reform and Party rectification work in the past month:
    In the process of the movement, due to different work foundations and different strengths of cadres, three different situations have been manifested: One type is to grasp the branch to solve problems, carry out criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and improve the political awareness of Party members in solving specific problems. All Party members participated in the movement and played the leading role of the branch in the movement. In rectifying the peasant association, Party members took the initiative to examine themselves, influencing the masses to also take the initiative to raise opinions and solve problems, some even making self-criticisms, and then launching criticism and self-criticism among the masses; criticizing the rural state of disorganization and anarchy, and overcoming extreme democratic phenomena. However, this type of village is in the minority. Another type is: it also grasps the branch problem, but in the process, it solves problems on the basis of problems, without infusing ideological mobilization, and without starting from improving the awareness of Party members and the masses. In terms of the guiding ideology of cadres in this type of village, it is only to remove obstacles in the conclusion of land reform, and simply believes that solving specific problems is to serve the conclusion of land reform. A certain village branch in Zuoquan discovered problems during the inspection, but did not dare to solve them, thinking that "this is not a problem to be solved now, but to be solved during Party rectification." This type of village is the majority in the entire region. One type of village is a purely task-oriented method of conclusion. This type of village simply handles procedures, follows regulations, schedules time, does not seek to solve problems or mobilize the masses, improve Party member awareness, and only seeks to complete the procedures. The result of this type of village is only to conclude land reform in form, without achieving the goal of improving the awareness and organization of Party members and the masses. In the thinking of Party members, it only solves individual problems, without achieving the goal of improving the Party's prestige and giving play to the enthusiasm of Party members. In terms of the leading role of the branch, it is only in name but not in reality. District cadres are still doing the work, without cultivating the leading role of the branch. This type of village is a very small minority in the entire region. It can be fully proved from the process of the movement that the internal factors of concluding land reform and Party rectification are closely integrated. It is manifested in the fact that the correct conclusion of land reform must improve the leadership of the branch. And most of the problems existing in the branch are problems of Party-masses relations, namely political privilege and domination; economic selfishness. By solving these problems, improving Party-masses relations, and transforming the branch members themselves, the Party's leading prestige is established, so that land reform can be concluded better. At the same time, it also proves that the main process of concluding land reform is the process of solving these problems of branch members. Secondly, it is proved in the actual movement that the central key to the method of combining the two is the development of criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the Party, and attention should be paid to implementing ideological education and ideological mobilization in the actual movement.
    　(Taihang Second Prefectural Committee Office)
  　Jizhong Regional Party Committee Research Office Summarizes Combined Experience
    I. Find the reasons to solve the problems, open up the thinking of Party members, and actively complete the conclusion of land reform: In Yuantou Village, Shenxian County, before the conclusion of land reform, the Party was negatively affected by the thinking of certain degenerate and backward elements, and evil tendencies were very high, causing many Party members to refuse to work. For example, a degenerate Party member surnamed Han often spread evil tendencies within the branch, saying: "We are not Party members anymore, we have no leader, only to rectify you!" Comrades Wang Hewen, Li Zhuanyi, and others, influenced by him, were afraid of Party rectification, so they held the idea of "better to do less than do more" in their work. Another example is Party member Li Wenzhang, a middle peasant, who had part of his land taken away during land reform. He was dissatisfied with the land reform and secretly cultivated the land that had been taken away in the autumn and planted wheat. Other middle peasants who had their land taken were also angry when they saw him doing this and wanted to retaliate, causing the poor and hired peasants to be demoralized, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of land reform. After the work team found these reasons, it publicized and prepared for the conclusion of land reform and the issuance of land ownership certificates on the one hand, and had individual talks with Party members with ideological problems, implementing Party policy education; at the same time, it carried out self-criticism and mutual criticism within the branch, supporting righteousness, and Party members actively started working. For example, when Comrade Li Wenzhang heard the policy of explaining compensation for middle peasants, he realized that although some of his land had been taken away, it was still no less than the land of ordinary middle peasants, and he had other income, and his life was good. He should take out part of his land to help poor and hired peasants, which is the attitude that a Communist Party member should have, and should not be seen as infringing on the interests of middle peasants. He first made a self-criticism in the branch, and then took the initiative to admit his mistake at the mass meeting, handing over the land, and even taking out the documents. This dispelled the concerns of some poor and hired peasants that they would not be able to "settle down" after the land was distributed. Old Party member Wang Xiushan always let his neighbors have enough land before registering his own when registering land. This promoted unity inside and outside the Party, creating an atmosphere of mutual concession, and making the work of issuing land ownership certificates go smoothly.
    II. Strengthen policy study, improve Party members' understanding, deeply publicize and prepare among the masses, and correct policies: For example, in Beibao Village, Anguo, the rich peasant Dong Tongshan was previously designated as a landlord. After studying the documents on class division and component designation, Party member Ding Xiaoxin said: "Dong Tongshan himself participates in major labor and cannot be considered a landlord." Ding Junkuai said: "The Gude Wen family hired workers 20 years ago, and there has been no exploitation since then. Designating them as rich peasants does not conform to our Party's policy and should be changed to middle peasants." After the Party members unified their thinking and understanding, they carried out extensive publicity and preparation among the masses. After group discussions by the masses, the result was that 17 middle peasant households in the village that had been wrongly designated as rich peasants, and one rich peasant household that had been wrongly designated as a landlord, were all corrected, and appropriate compensation was given to the middle peasants whose interests had been infringed upon. Before the distribution of floating wealth, Party members first studied the "Decision on Handling Floating Wealth," and then conducted discussions and research in the people's school, and the floating wealth was appropriately distributed. Because Party members' policy level was improved, they correctly implemented the Party's policy in their work, greatly improving the Party's prestige among the masses.
    III. Unified leadership and scientific division of labor are the key to the close integration of various tasks: In Beishan Village, Raoyang, when carrying out the work of supporting the front in concluding land reform, the branch and the peasant congress first convened a meeting of all village cadres for democratic discussion, and everyone made specific divisions of labor. Armed forces department cadre Shu Quan (branch committee member) first said: "Shi Luozheng and I are responsible for war service mobilization, and we guarantee that we will set up cooperatives." Cadres from other departments all carried out the work of concluding land reform under the leadership of the peasant congress. When registering land and issuing land ownership certificates, publicity, registration, and measurement groups were set up, and all those who could write and calculate in the village and the activists among the masses were organized into four large groups and sixteen small groups to register land. The chairman and vice-chairman did not divide into groups, but formed a leading core with the group leaders. After the task of supporting the front arrived, the district assigned the village to send seventeen carts, two stretchers, and a total of more than forty people, including doctors following the migrant workers to the expedition. Under the exemplary role of the cadres and Party members supporting the front, they were successfully opened to the front, and the village's work on concluding land reform and production is also progressing smoothly.

  　Two Ways of Combination in Jizhong
    According to Hebei Daily, Anguo and Hejian counties have gained preliminary experience in concluding land reform and Party rectification, but their methods are different. The following is a separate introduction for reference and research. (1) Anguo Third District's method: Other work was also combined in the conclusion of land reform. First of all, in terms of Party rectification: it improved the class awareness of Party members and the Party's prestige among the masses. For example, in Wurenqiao City, branch members conducted concluding land reform with farmers during the day, and conducted examinations and criticisms in connection with documents at night, influencing many upright farmers to apply to join the Party. Unity among cadres was also strengthened, and bureaucratic styles of work were reformed. Party member cadres who were emotional and unwilling to work also began to work. (2) Hejian First District's method: In the work of concluding land reform, it combined to solve the different problems existing within the Party. When Ningzhuang Village focused on reviewing components, a branch committee member led the reduction of the components of his relatives. At this time, a struggle against landlord and rich peasant ideology and against unstable positions was launched within the Party. After debate and criticism, he admitted his mistake. When Shicun distributed floating wealth, a Party member distributed more clothes, and everyone launched a struggle against selfish and self-interested ideology. Based on the gradual improvement of the masses' awareness, the masses were called upon to make suggestions to Party members to help transform the Party members' thinking and style of work. Some villages also closely combined the distribution of floating wealth with the registration of land and the organization of production: When Ningzhuang distributed floating wealth, the masses brought contracts, and the registration section was set up at the entrance of the distribution of floating wealth, waiting for those who received floating wealth to register their land first. Nanmatan sold floating wealth to buy agricultural tools. When distributing, on the basis of farmers' willingness, several families jointly distributed a set (plow, harrow, rope set, etc.) to organize and consolidate production mutual aid groups. Beimatan organized cooperatives through the distribution of floating wealth, overcoming the problem of single-handed work.
    Taiyue Second Prefectural Committee Instructions
  　Properly Resolving Party-Masses Relations Is the Central Link in Concluding Land Reform
    [Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue Second Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an instruction to the county committees of various counties on the fifth of last month, pointing out that the central link in the work of concluding land reform is the proper resolution of Party-masses relations. For example, the issues of poor peasant relations, loophole issues, and accumulated fruit issues are mostly issues of cadre-masses relations. Therefore, Party rectification must be well combined with land reform to seriously resolve the relationship between the Party and the masses. The Taiyue Regional Party Committee believes that this instruction is very necessary and is specially published in the Taiyue Xinhua Daily for reference by various places. The instruction first pointed out that the central link in our work of concluding land reform is that the issue of Party-masses relations must be properly resolved. For example, it is found that feudal and semi-feudal systems have not been completely eliminated, and there are still remnants. Some landlords and rich peasants still retain more and better land and property than farmers, and individual rich peasants have not followed the provisions of the Land Law Outline and collected their excess portions. The vast majority of this is due to the protection of cadres and Party members. Individual landlords and rich peasants have infiltrated the Party and used the Party's position to continue to oppress the masses. Another example is that about 10% of poor and hired peasants have not received the fruits they should have received, as well as the existing issues of middle and poor peasant relations. The reason for this is of course first that we made mistakes in the implementation of the policy towards middle peasants, but in the entire implementation process, there were many cases of personal revenge, or because they occupied more themselves, the target turned to middle peasants. The issues of middle and poor peasant relations that exist in most places are in essence issues of cadre-masses relations. Another example is the issue of accumulated fruits, which is also caused by cadres concealing them, attempting to embezzle them, or to facilitate expenses. Therefore, in land reform and Party rectification, we must firmly grasp this link to smoothly solve other problems. For this reason, Party rectification must be well combined with the work of concluding land reform. In land reform and Party rectification, we must fully develop the democracy of the masses, carefully and analytically listen to the opinions of the masses and accept their criticism, and seriously and solemnly treat various mistakes of Party member cadres who have lost their position, are selfish and self-interested, and infringe on the interests of the people, especially the occupation of fruits by cadres and activists. We must carry out criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the Party, and no error of indulgence or compromise is allowed. Otherwise, the relationship between the Party and the masses cannot be improved, the Party will become more divorced from the masses, and the remaining feudalism cannot be completely eliminated. The infringement of middle peasants cannot be resolved, left-leaning tendencies cannot be corrected, policies cannot be rectified, the conclusion of land reform will create new mistakes again, and the work of concluding land reform will not be done well.

　　结束土改与整党应如何结合进行？（编者按）
    全区整党与结束土改工作，自去年十一月下旬后，均已普遍展开。太行已结束的与正在进行的村庄，约占总数的百分之五十左右，冀中约占百分之七十五，冀南约占百分之六十六强，太岳分三期进行，已完成第一期。冀鲁豫老区的个别县已接近完成，争取阴历年前老区完成结束土改工作，北岳从行唐、井陉两县的材料看，亦于元月初召开了全县扩大会议，具体组织这一任务的进行。各地干部大都是在十月前后下乡的，经过一个多月的努力，已将运动推广至全区范围，这一段的成绩是很大的。党的土地改革与整党政策，已为广大群众所了解和接受，这完全可以从目前农民所表现的空前高涨的生产热情中得到证明。运动中所取得的经验是极其丰富的；但某些地区由于领导上对整党与结束土改两项工作如何结合进行的问题认识模糊，也由于各地党的基础、党群关系、群众觉悟程度等的差别，因此在指导思想上及做法上，某些地方便发生了些偏差。从以下材料可以看出，结束土改与整党如何结合进行，其中心关键在于正确地开展党内外批评与自我批评，发动群众，提高党员、群众的觉悟，对党员干部的错误丝毫不能采取迁就姑息的态度。现我们特将各地来稿及油印总结材料中所提到的有关这类问题的论点，加以整理发表，目的在于供给领导这一运动的同志参考。　　　　——编者
    太行二地委总结三种类型经验
  　结束土改中贯彻整党党群关系能完满解决
    太行二地委召开县书会议，讨论与检查土改整党工作，与会同志一致明确了结束土改必须同时结合进行整党。二者不是互相妨碍，而是互相推动，不是拖长时间，而是可以缩短时间。同时也只有正确的结合进行，才能完满达到结束土改与整党的目的。会议中对一月来的结束土改与整党工作，做了如下估计：
    在运动进行过程中，由于工作基础不同，干部力量强弱不同，表现了三种不同情况：一种类型是抓住支部解决问题，在党内开展了批评与自我批评，在解决具体问题中提高了党员的政治觉悟，全部党员参加了运动，发挥了支部在运动中的领导作用。在整顿农会中，党员主动检查自己，影响到群众也起来主动提意见解决问题，有的并做了自我检讨，进而开展了群众间的批评与自我批评；批判了农村无组织无政府状态，克服了极端民主现象。但这类村是少数。一种类型是：也抓住了支部问题，但在进行中是就问题解决问题，没有贯注了思想发动，没有从提高党员、群众觉悟出发。这类村在干部指导思想上，仅为扫除结束土改中的障碍，把解决具体问题，单纯认为是为结束土改而服务的。左权某村支部在检查中发现了问题，而不敢解决问题，以为“这不是现在解决的问题，整党时再解决。”这种类型的村，在全区说来是多数。一种类型村是单纯任务观点的结束方法，这种村是单纯办理手续，按条文，排时间，不求问题解决与发动群众，提高党员觉悟，单求手续走到。这类村的结果仅仅是在形式上结束了土改，而没有达到提高党员群众的觉悟性、组织性，在党员思想上仅仅是解决了个别问题，而没有达到提高党的威信，并发挥党员积极性之目的。在支部领导作用上，仅仅是有其名而无其实。区干部还在把着干，而没有培养了支部的领导作用。这种村在全区说来是极少数。从运动过程中完全可以证明，结束土改和整党内在因素就是密切结合的。表现在正确进行结束土改就必须是提高支部的领导。而支部存在的问题大部是党群关系问题，即政治上的特权统治；经济上的自私自利。通过解决这些问题，改善党群关系，改造了支部党员自己，树立了党的领导威信，这样才能更好的结束了土改。同时也证明了结束土改主要过程，就是解决支部党员这些问题的过程。其次是在运动的实际中证明了二者结合进行的方法中心关键在于党内外的批评与自我批评的开展，并注意在实际运动中，贯彻思想教育和思想发动。
    　（太行二地委办公室）
  　冀中区党委研究室总结结合经验
    一、找原因解疙瘩，打通党员思想，积极完成结束土改：深县院头村，在结束土改前，党内因受某些个别蜕化分子落后分子思想的影响，邪气挺高，闹的好多党员不干工作。如一个姓韩的蜕化党员，常在支部内散布邪气说：“咱不是党员了，没有管头啦，光剩下整你们啦！”王鹤文、李转义等同志因受了他的影响，害怕整党，工作中便抱着“多一事不如少一事”的思想。又如党员李文章，是个中农，在土改时被抽出一部土地，便对土改不满，秋天的时候，私自把被抽出的地耕了耩上麦子。别的被动地户见到他这样作，也就气高了，想进行报复，闹的贫雇农情绪低落，造成了结束土改的严重障碍。工作组找出这些原因后，便一面宣传酝酿结束土改发土地证，一面对思想上有毛病的党员作个别谈话，贯彻党的政策教育；同时在支部内开展自我批评与互相批评，扶持了正气，党员才积极工作起来。如李文章同志听到解释补偿中农的政策，认识到自己虽被抽出一些土地，但还不少于一般中农土地数，又有别的收入，生活又高，应当拿出一部土地帮助贫雇农，才是共产党员应有的态度，不能看成是侵犯中农利益。他便先在支部里作了检讨，后又自动在群众大会上承认错误，交回土地，并连文书都拿出来。这样打破了某些贫雇农怕分了地“落不住”的顾虑。老党员王秀山在登记土地时，总是自个先让够地邻，然后才登记他的。这样促进了党内外的团结，造成了互相尽让的风气，使发土地证工作顺利进行。
    二、加强政策学习，提高党员认识，深入群众宣传酝酿，端正政策：如安国北堡村，富农董同善，以前订成地主，经过学习划阶级订成份的文件后，党员丁小辛说：“人家董同善自个参加主要劳动，不能算地主。”丁俊魁说：“谷德温家二十年前雇过活，以后什么剥削也没有了，订成富农可不合乎咱们党的政策，应当改成中农。”在党员统一思想认识后，便在群众中开展了广泛的宣传酝酿，经群众分组讨论，结果全村十七户中农错订为富农的，一户富农错订为地主的，都作了改正，并适当的补偿了被侵犯的中农。在分浮财前，党员并首先学习了“关于处理浮财的决定”，随后又在民校中进行了讨论研究，把浮财作了适当分配。由于党员政策水平的提高，工作中正确执行了党的政策，在群众中大大提高了党的威信。
    三、统一领导，科学分工，是各种工作密切结合的关键：饶阳北善村，在进行结束土改支前工作中，支部协同农代会首先召开了全村干部会，民主讨论，大家进行具体分工。武装部干部书权（支委）先说：“我和石洛正，负责战勤动员，并保证要搞起合作社来。”其他各部门干部都统一在农代会领导下进行结束土改工作。在登记土地颁发土地证时，便又设了宣传、登记丈量等股，并把全村能写算的人和群众中的积极分子也都组织起来，分为四大片，十六小片，进行土地登记，正副主席不分片，和各片小组长组成领导核心。支前任务到来后，区分配该村出十七辆大车，两副担架，连同跟随民工出征的医生共四十余人。在支前干部及党员的模范作用下，顺利的开到了前方，村中结束土改和生产等工作也正顺利进行。  　　　　　
　　（冀中区党委研究室）
  　冀中的两种结合情形
    据河北日报报导，安国与河间两县在结束土改与整党中均已获得初步经验，但方法上各有不同，兹分别介绍如下：以供参考研究。（一）安国三区的作法：在结束土改中，还结合做了其他工作。首先在整党方面：提高了党员的阶级觉悟和党在群众中的威信。如伍仁桥市，支部党员白天与农民一起进行结束土改，晚上就联系文件进行检讨、批评，影响的很多正派农民都要求入党。干部之间也增强了团结，并改造了官僚主义作风。闹情绪不工作的党员干部也开始工作起来了。（二）河间一区的作法：在进行结束土改工作中，结合解决党内存在着的不同问题。宁庄村重点审查成份时，一个支委领导着给他的亲戚降低成份，这时便在党内开展了反地主富农思想、反立场不稳的斗争，经过争论批评，他承认了错误。时村分浮财时，一个党员多分了衣服，大家便开展了反自私自利的思想斗争。并根据群众觉悟的逐渐提高，号召群众对党员提意见，帮助转变了党员的思想作风。有的村分浮财与登记土地组织生产也作了密切结合：宁庄分浮财时群众带着文契，登记股设在分浮财的门口，等着领浮财的就先登记土地。南马滩卖了浮财买成农具，分时，在农民自愿基础上，几家合着分一套（犁、耙、绳套等），组织和巩固了生产互助组。北马滩通过分浮财组织起合作社。克服了工作上单打一的毛病。
    太岳二地委指示
  　妥善解决党群关系是结束土改中心环节
    【太岳电】中共太岳二地委在上月五日给各县县委会发出一个指示，指出：结束土改工作中的中心环节是党群关系的妥善解决。如贫农关系问题、漏斗问题、积存果实问题等，很多是干群关系问题，所以在土改中必须很好结合整党，认真的解决党与群众的关系问题。太岳区党委认为这一指示甚为必要，特在太岳新华日报上发表，作为各地的参考。指示中首先指出：我们在结束土改工作中的中心环节，是党群关系问题必须得到妥善的解决。例如发现封建半封建未彻底消灭，还有残余，一部分地主、富农仍保存比农民较多较好的土地财产，个别富农未按土地法大纲规定。征收其多余部分。这绝大多数是因为干部党员的包庇。个别地主、富农钻到党内来，利用党的地位继续欺压群众。又如百分之十左右的贫雇农未分到应分的果实，以及存在的中贫农关系问题。其原因当然首先是我们在执行对中农的政策上，曾发生过错误，但在整个执行中，却有很多是私人报复，或因自己多占，目标转向中农。大部分地方存在的中贫农关系问题，很多在实质上是干群关系问题。再如积存果实问题，也是干部隐瞒，企图贪污或便于开支等造成。因之土改整党中，我们必须抓紧这一环节，才会顺利的解决其他问题。为此，在结束土改工作中，必须很好的结合整党；在土改整党中，必须充分发扬群众的民主，细心地有分析地听取群众意见与接受群众批评，认真地严肃地对待党员干部丧失立场，自私自利与侵犯人民利益的各种错误，特别是干部和积极分子的侵占果实，一定要开展党内外的批评与自我批评，不允许任何姑息迁就的错误态度。否则，党与群众的关系是不可能改善的，党会更加脱离群众，而残留的封建就不可能被彻底消灭。侵犯中农就不可能得到解决，左偏不会得到纠正，政策就不可能得到端正，结束土改也就会再造成新的错误，而使土改结束工作搞不好。
