　　▲The Romanian oil industry achieved great success in 1948. Crude oil production in 1948 exceeded that of 1946 and 1947, completing 101 percent of the production plan. The drilling plan was completed at 103 percent, and the refining plan was completed at 100.6 percent. The number of gas wells drilled last year was four times more than in 1938. Ore production completed 192.8 percent of the production plan, iron - 108.3 percent, manganese - 108.1 percent, gold - 101.2 percent, lead - 103.4 percent, and mercury - 200 percent.
　　▲In 1948, Czechoslovakia's total exports amounted to 37,604.8 million Czech crowns, and total imports amounted to 37,716.244 million Czech crowns. Therefore, the import surplus of approximately 5 billion in the first half of last year has been almost completely eliminated. Last year, Czech trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries increased significantly, and trade relations were maintained with Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United States, France, Switzerland, and other countries.
　　▲The Romanian Labor Youth League has recently initiated a congress of representatives from all democratic youth organizations to establish a "unified labor youth revolutionary organization for factories, farms, institutions, and schools." This motion was passed based on the resolution of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party regarding the party's work among youth. The new organization produced by the congress will include youth of all nationalities and will be based on the model of the Soviet Communist Youth League. It will organize and lead the activities of the Young Pioneers, educate youth with Marxist ideology, and make concentrated efforts to complete the national economic plan.
