　　Welcome Readers to Actively Offer Opinions and Improve the Party Newspaper
    The Broad Masses of Readers Love This Newspaper and Contribute Many Suggestions for Improvement
  　First Collection
    To the Editors:
    I have the following three opinions regarding the "People's Daily." Please consider whether they are appropriate.
    (1) It has been handled successfully. Both the content and format are more advanced than in the past. Especially since expanding to four pages, the included content is richer and more welcomed by readers. I hope it will improve further.
    (2) Shortcomings: (A) Individual headlines do not match the content of the article. For example, in September there was a report on the study session of the directly affiliated organizations of the North China Bureau, but the headline read "Central Government Organizations Study," etc. If one only looked at the headline, one would think it was the central government organizations that studied, which could easily be misleading. (B) Typos constantly appear, although they can be corrected quickly. This is a manifestation of carelessness in the work. (C) There is too little introduction to the economic construction of the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe (although an article by Lei Yiting, "Czechoslovakia Moving Towards Socialism," was published). (D) The publication of literary works that reflect reality, have realistic educational significance, and are highly infectious is limited to Comrade Zhao Shuli's "Good Will Prevail." There are too few works that depict great historical events in a simple, fluent, and accessible style. (E) The international weekly articles are too general; they are not persuasive enough in a light, lively manner. (F) The sporadic publication of production dispatches from various places, summarizing the experiences of a certain period as work guidance, is done quite poorly.
    (3) Nine suggestions: 1. In order to promote and organize the study of theory and culture, the fourth page should be expanded to not only publish introductions and exchanges of experiences in studying theory, but also pay attention to cultural aspects. In particular, the use of strange characters or nouns and terms that no one but "oneself" understands should be minimized. When their use is unavoidable, they should be explained. To ensure the uniformity of writing, this work should be vigorously promoted. Secondly, invite comrades with considerable experience in writing to write about the methods of writing various articles and publish them in the newspaper. This will greatly promote cultural learning.
    2. More introductions to science and technology should be provided. Because industrial construction is impossible without science and technology. In the words of Comrade Stalin, "Technical backwardness will be beaten!" For example, how to improve coal mining technology and increase production can be introduced with reference to the Stakhanov method, but not by completely copying it or applying it indiscriminately without regard to specific circumstances.
    3. Introduce more about the economic and transportation construction of Eastern Europe for reference.
    4. Add a "New Book Recommendation" column to the study section. The introduction should not be too long, within 500 words.
    5. Good articles published elsewhere, such as "Five Major Families of India" and "The Situation in Burma" in the past (the manuscripts are not on hand, the titles may be mistaken), can be moved to the newspaper for publication. (Editor's note: It would be best if you could send us the article.)
    6. We have many achievements in production and economic construction, and if they can be reflected in literature and art, the educational significance will be considerable.
    7. Editors and proofreaders should strive to minimize typos and aim for no typos at all.
    8. The reading dictionary is very helpful to readers and should be continued and enriched, and should be coordinated with the telegrams, news dispatches, or papers of the day.
    9. The newspaper should promote concise, refined, and lively writing.
    The above three aspects of opinions are put forward in the capacity of a reader. If there is anything inappropriate, please explain.

### 欢迎读者踊跃提意见，改进党报  广大读者热爱本报贡献许多改进意见

　　欢迎读者踊跃提意见，改进党报
    广大读者热爱本报贡献许多改进意见
  　第一辑
    编辑同志：
    对“人民日报”我有下列三方面的意见，是否适当，请考虑。
    （一）办得有成绩，无论内容、形式都比过去进步了。特别从扩大到四版以来，包括的内容更为丰富，更受读者所欢迎，希望更进一步。
    （二）缺点（Ａ）个别标题与该文内容不符合。例如九月份有一篇华北局直属机关学习报导的稿子，而标题是“中直机关学习”等字眼，若只看标题以为是中直机关学习了，容易使人误会。（Ｂ）错字不断出现，虽很快就可更正，但这是工作上粗枝大叶的表现。（Ｃ）东欧新民主主义国家底经济建设的介绍做得太少了（虽登过一篇雷一霆译的“向社会主义迈进的捷克斯拉夫”）。（Ｄ）反映现实而有现实教育意义与富有强度感染力的文艺作品的发表，只有赵树理同志的“邪不压正”；而用质朴的笔调，通俗流畅的文字刻划伟大的历史事件的作品实在太少。（Ｅ）国际一周的文章写得过于一般化，轻松活泼而有说服力做得不够。（Ｆ）零散的发表各地生产通讯稿，将某一个时期的经验总结起来，作为工作指导，做得相当差。
    （三）九点建议：１、为了推动与组织理论与文化的学习，第四版应扩大，不但登载学习理论经验的介绍和交流，文化方面也该注意一下。尤其是关于一些除“自己”之外谁也不懂得的怪字或名词、术语要尽量少用，非用不可时，也应加解释。为了保证文字的统一应该大力宣传这种工作。其次、约一些对写文章很有经验的同志写一写关于各种文章的作法，在报上发表。这对推动文化学习有很大作用。
    ２、科学与技术的东西，应该多介绍一些。因为要进行工业建设，没有或缺乏科学与技术是不可能的。用斯大林同志的话来说就是：“技术的落后是要挨打的”！例如怎样改进挖煤技术及增产，可介绍斯泰哈诺夫的办法作参考，但并不是全盘照抄，不问具体情形乱套一阵。
    ３、多介绍东欧经济交通建设情况，以利参考。
    ４、在学习栏增一“新书推荐”栏，介绍文字不宜长，五百字以内就行。
    ５、他处发表过的好文章，如过去“印度五大家族”及“缅甸的现状”（稿未在手头，题目可能记错）可以移到报上发表。（编者按：最好请将该文寄给我们。）
    ６、我们在生产经济建设上有许多成就，如能用文艺反映出来，教育意义不小。
    ７、编辑与校对应做到少错字，以不错字为原则。
    ８、读报辞典帮助读者大，应继续下去并丰富起来，更要配合当天的电报、新闻通讯或论文。
    ９、报纸文字应提倡简短精练生动。
    以上三方面的意见，谨以读者一分子的资格提出，如有不恰当处，请解释。
