　　To the Editor:
　　You are currently soliciting readers' opinions, and I have the following suggestions for your reference. First, the fourth page should publish more hygiene knowledge and hygiene Q&As. Second, Zhao Shuli's articles are good and more of his works should be published. Third, I like to read the first and fourth pages, as well as the Inquiries and Replies section. Study and discussion is also very good. Fourth, our station is twenty miles away from Shijiazhuang City, and we don't receive the newspaper in a timely manner. For example, we can only read the issues of the 22nd and 23rd on the 25th. Can you deliver it once a day (e.g., read yesterday's paper today)? Fifth, I think Criticism and Suggestions, Inquiries and Replies, and Voices of the Masses all play a very important role and can promote the improvement of work. Reader Li Yun

　　可再登些卫生常识
  　发行工作应加改进
    编辑同志：
    贵报现在征求读者意见，我有如下几点意见提出，对否请你们作参考。一、第四版应再登些卫生常识及卫生问答。二、赵树理的文章好，应多登些这类作品。三、我喜欢看的是第一版和第四版以及询问与答复。学习讨论也很好。四、我们驻地离石门市二十里路，看的报都不及时，如二十五号才能看二十二号和二十三号的报，是否能给每天送一次（如今天看昨天的报）呢？五、批评与建议、询问与答复、群众呼声，我认为起的作用都很大，能推动改进工作。　读者李云
