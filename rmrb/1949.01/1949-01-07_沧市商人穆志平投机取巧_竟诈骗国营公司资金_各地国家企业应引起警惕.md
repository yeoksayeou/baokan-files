　　Cangzhou Merchant Mu Zhiping Engages in Speculation and Trickery, Defrauding State-Owned Company Funds – State Enterprises in All Regions Should Be Vigilant
    [Hebei Central News] Last spring, the Cangzhou State-owned Dadong Company (formerly under Bohai, now merged with the Hebei Central Dongxing Main Store) wanted to quickly complete the task of purchasing sacks. They planned to support private individuals in establishing sack factories and looked for potential candidates everywhere. They found a merchant named Mu Zhiping, who was originally a speculator despised by merchants and residents of Botou. To avoid his "bad reputation," he ran a cigarette factory in Cangzhou and often uttered a few "progressive words." Dadong Company, impressed by his eloquent speech, decided to support him in setting up a sack factory. The company helped him find a house and workers, and the bank lent him 2 million North Sea currency. They also agreed that Dadong would supply the jute fiber, and the factory would weave by hand, with a manual fee of 3.4 jin of rice per sack. Dadong also found five other people to spin the jute into fiber, paying a handling fee of 30 yuan per jin of jute. Mu Zhiping saw that this 30 yuan handling fee was a bargain and requested the company to also entrust him with the task of distributing jute for spinning. The company agreed. Because the company only stipulated that each sack should weigh 3.4 jin, without any requirements on the quality of the sacks, the resulting sacks could leak wheat and sorghum. Mu Zhiping further requested: "The manual fee is too low, the workers demand a living standard of one meter of cloth and one meter of flour. I am losing money. If you don't increase the manual fee, you should first allocate a batch of jute and wages to me so I can operate." The company agreed again, and successively allocated 9,070 jin of good jute (valued at 18.14 million yuan), 4,146 jin of millet, 1.78 million North Sea currency, and 703 jin of fiber. Mu Zhiping, seeing that Dadong neither urged repayment nor inspected, embezzled public funds from the sack factory to develop his cigarette factory. He indulged in extravagance and created a false impression. A sack factory with four weaving machines, which originally required only ten people, employed eighteen people, with no fewer than twenty people eating meals every day. He installed twelve electric lights, renovated the storefront, and squandered money. Many merchants said: "Look, old Mu is having a great time relying on the public." It wasn't until the end of October, when Dadong Company and Dongxing Main Store merged and settled accounts, that they discovered that the small Lihua Sack Factory had occupied state funds amounting to 22.91727 million yuan (North Sea currency), while the number of sacks produced was very small. After sending people to the sack factory to understand the situation, although they learned about these circumstances, they did not yet see through Mu Zhiping's speculative trick of using state capital in the name of a sack factory to develop his cigarette factory. Therefore, when both parties agreed on the quality of the sacks and continued manual weaving, Mu Zhiping seized on the idea that "anyway, state-owned stores are supporting industry and commerce" and insisted that the 22.9 million yuan of capital invested by the company was not enough. He demanded another 2,000 jin of jute and 3.5 million yuan, and the manual fee had to be increased to 10 jin of rice per sack (making the cost of the sacks 4,000 yuan more expensive than the best sacks on the market). If they didn't agree, he would refuse to work. He also said: "You said at the beginning that you wouldn't let me lose money anyway. Now I have lost 3 million yuan. I can't repay the public's money even after seven months." After repeated discussions, Dongxing only agreed to give him more profit. Mu Zhiping, seeing that the opportunity was small, quickly sold the more than 200 sacks he had in stock for 2.3 million yuan. Afterwards, Dongxing pointed out that he should not have sold them in violation of the contract, but he went around saying: "I can't do it anymore, Dongxing is not supporting me!" Then he rushed to weave another 250 sacks and sold them privately for 2.87 million yuan, determined to play rogue with the Dongxing Main Store. After Mu Zhiping's speculative conspiracy was discovered, Dongxing had no choice but to request the municipal government to resolve the issue. Mu Zhiping personally reported the accounts, and the result was a profit of more than 3 million yuan. The municipal government ordered Mu Zhiping's Lihua Sack Factory to return Dongxing's capital. At this time, Mu Zhiping was still looking for loopholes everywhere, spreading rumors and slandering Dongxing Main Store for suppressing industry and commerce. Some responsible cadres not only did not learn from the lesson but instead pleaded for him, suggesting "continue operating" or "deferring the return of state capital." It was as if state-owned enterprises should unconditionally donate state capital to speculators. State enterprises support production on the condition that it is production that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and that the operators are legitimate. Taking state capital to fill the bottomless pit of speculators is a serious mistake and a crime. Speculative elements who undermine the economy should be restricted and punished to a certain extent. The lesson of "supporting" Lihua Sack Factory should arouse the vigilance of state enterprise departments in all regions.

　　沧市商人穆志平投机取巧
  　竟诈骗国营公司资金
    各地国家企业应引起警惕
    【冀中讯】去年春沧市国营大东公司（原属渤海，现已和冀中东兴总店合并），想赶快完成采购麻袋的任务，打算扶植私人开办麻袋厂，到处找扶植对象，结果找到一个叫穆志平的商人，他原是泊头商民贱视的投机家，为躲避“臭名”，跑到沧市开了个烟厂，嘴上常挂着几句“进步话”。大东公司见他说的漂亮，就扶植他搞麻袋厂。公司帮他找房子，找工人，银行贷给他二百万元北海币。还约定：由大东供给麻经子，工厂织手工，每条麻袋手工费三斤四两米。大东又另找了五个人，把麻发给群众纺成经子，每斤麻得三十元手续费，穆志平见这三十元手续费是便宜事，要求公司把发麻纺经子的事，也交给他做。公司答应了。因为公司只规定每条麻袋三斤四两重，没有从麻袋的质量上作任何要求，结果所织的麻袋能漏过麦子、高粱。穆志平又进一步要求：“手工费太低，工人要求一米一面的生活，我赔钱了，你们不长手工费，就先拨一批麻和一批工资给我，我好活动。”公司又答应了，先后拨了好麻九千零七十斤（价一千八百一十四万元），小米四千一百四十六斤，北海币一百七十八万元，经子七百零三斤。穆志平见大东既不催贷，又不检查，就捣用麻袋厂的公款，去发展他的烟厂。他大吃二喝，虚张声势，四张机于的麻袋厂本来有十个人就行，他却用了十八个人，每天吃饭的不下二十多人。按了十二个电灯，装修门面，大肆铺张。好多商人说：“你看，老穆仗着公家闹欢了。”直到十月底，大东公司和东兴总店合并清结帐目时才发现小小的利华麻袋厂，占压国家资金二千二百九十一万七千二百七十元（北海币），织出来的麻袋却是很少。派人到麻袋厂了解后，虽知道了这些情况，但还没看透穆志平借用国家资本，以麻袋厂为名来达到发展他的烟厂的投机花样。所以当双方商定了麻袋的质量，仍织手工以后，穆志平抓住“反正你国营商店是扶植工商业的”，咬定公司投入的二千二百九十多万资金还不够，非要求再给他二千斤麻和三百五十万款子，手工费也得长到十斤米一条才行（使麻袋的成本，比市面最好的麻袋还贵四千元），不答应就不干了。还说：“你们开头说过，反正不叫我赔钱，现在我赔了三百万元，赔的公家这点钱，七个月以后也还不了。”经再三商量，东兴只答应给他更多的利润。穆志平见缝子小了，赶快把存的二百多麻袋卖了二百三十万元。事后，东兴指出他不该违约出卖，他却到处说：“干不了啦，东兴不扶植我了！”接着他又赶织了二百五十条麻袋，私自出卖了二百八十七万元，决心跟东兴总店耍无赖。穆志平的投机阴谋被察觉以后，东兴不得不请求市政府解决。穆志平亲口报帐，结果是赚了三百多万元。市政府判令穆志平所办利华麻袋厂，归还东兴的资本。这时穆志平还在到处钻空子，造谣诬蔑东兴总店打击工商业。有的负责干部不但不接受教训，反倒替他说情“再干”或“缓期交还国家资本”。好象国营企业就应该把国家的资本去无条件的赠送给投机商。国家企业扶植生产是有条件的，必须是有利国计民生的生产，也必须是正当的经营者。如果拿着国家的资本去填投机家的无底洞，就是严重的错误和罪恶。那些破坏经济的投机分子，应该受到限制和一定制裁。“扶植”利华麻袋厂的教训，应引起各地国家企业部的警惕。
