Criticism and Suggestions

　　Suggest Implementing a Regular Tax Collection Method on Zhengding North Great Bridge
    To the Editor:
    Our team was heading north from Huolu, and when we passed the North Great Bridge in Zhengding, we saw two bicycles stopped at one end of the bridge, arguing with the bridge manager about how much toll to pay. This gave us an unpleasant feeling. I think this could easily lead to the following problems: First, comrades who are new to the liberated areas may misunderstand and feel that taxes in the liberated areas are also high. Second, disputes may arise, obstructing traffic. Third, if the collectors are not well-disciplined, they may easily engage in corruption (collecting without receipts). However, the funding for repairing bridges and roads is indeed a problem. Could it be possible to register all vehicles, such as large carts and bicycles, issue license plates, and stipulate how much money to be collected every half year or year, starting from the cities and then extending to the countryside? This would also prevent unregistered vehicles from evading service duties. Please forward this to the Public Works Bureau for consideration.
    Furthermore, when passing the North Great Bridge in Ding County, we even saw the bridge manager fighting with a vehicle owner over the collection of bridge tolls. We do not fully understand the inside story and have not investigated further. We hope you will forward this to the relevant authorities for investigation and consideration.

### 建议正定北大桥上实行定期收税办法

　　建议正定北大桥上实行定期收税办法
    编辑同志：
    我队由获鹿北上，途经正定之北大桥，见有二自行车阻于桥之一端，正在和管桥的同志争执付多少过桥钱，这给我们一个不愉快的感觉，我以为这容易发生下列几个弊病：一、新来解放区的同志见了，易生误解，觉得解放区的税也不少。二、发生争执，阻碍交通。三、征收员假如修养不够，易于舞弊（征收时无收条）。但修理桥、路的经费的确也是一个问题，是否可以将大车、自行车等，一律登记，发给牌照，规定半年或一年收多少钱，先从城市开始，然后乡村。这样又可防止躲避勤务的黑车。请转公用局考虑。
    又：在过定县北的大桥时，竟见管桥同志与车主为征收过桥费，打起架来，我们对内情也不十分了解，未加调查。希望转交有关当局进行调查考虑。
