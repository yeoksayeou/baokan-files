(Jinan Branch News) Zhou Zhensheng, a technician at the Handan Electric Company, has modified gasification pipes, utilizing waste gas from the steam pump, saving 20,000 jin of coal per month. Recently, under the inspiration of Manager Wang and with the help of fellow workers in the boiler room, Zhou Zhensheng connected the waste gas from the four-inch steam pump to the water tank, increasing the water temperature. As a result of the modification, more than 20,000 jin of coal are saved each month, which is a significant achievement. Despite achieving such great success, he is not at all arrogant. He still leads the work on the furnace every day, overseeing and repairing the machinery, covered in grease, without any complaints. Before the liberation of Handan, he worked as an apprentice at the company, suffering beatings and mistreatment. After liberation, he went to work at the Dacheng Machinery Factory as a lathe operator. He didn't know anything at first, but he worked hard and mastered a set of skilled techniques in less than a year. Now, when asked why he wanted to modify the gasification pipes, he smiles and says, "The factory is our own home, the sweat and blood of the people. But since the company resumed operations, it has been losing money, which is very disheartening. I feel very sorry for the public and the people, so I am determined to find a way to transform it."

  　努力改装化气管每月省炭两万斤
    【冀南分社讯】邯郸电灯公司技术工人周振声，改装化气管，利用汽泵乏气，一月省炭两万斤。最近周振声在王经理的启示和锅炉房工友们的帮助下，把四英寸汽泵的乏气，接到水箱里，增加了水的温度，改装结果，一月省炭两万多斤，这是一个很大的创造。他获这样一个大成绩，丝毫不骄傲，每天仍在洪炉上领着头的看管和修理机器，满身油腻，毫没怨言。邯郸解放以前，他在公司当学徒，挨打受气。解放后他到大成机器厂旋床上做工，开始一点也不会，但他很努力，不到一年就学成了一套熟练的技术。现在问他为啥要改装化气管时，他笑着说：“工厂是自己的家，是人民的血汗，可是公司自复工后老是赔钱，心里挺丧气，觉着很对不起公家，也对不起人民，所以一心要想法改造它。”
