[Ji Zhong News] In import and export trade, Cangzhou's inns and goods yards have played a certain role. Guangyuan Goods Yard handled more than 400,000 jin of jujubes for export in eight months; Tongxing Goods Yard exported more than 260,000 jin of jujubes, more than 19,000 jin of melon seeds, more than 30,000 jin of yams, more than 25,500 pieces of straw braid, more than 129,000 jin of wool, and 6,473 sheepskins in six months. As a result, many goods yards are making money. However, illegal speculation, profiteering, and embezzlement of payments by the inns and goods yards also occur frequently. Here, the inns and goods yards are not separated. Except for individual specialized operations in jujubes, pears, mountain goods, and yams, they generally deal in everything from mountain goods and local products to foreign goods, salt, and grain. Even big cart inns and some hotels and restaurants hang signs saying "Acting on behalf of customers to buy and sell." Many goods yards are amateurs when it comes to operating in hides and furs, pig bristles, and yams. Sometimes they deceive merchants by buying fake goods on behalf of customers. In general, the goods yards engage in transactions of smuggled goods, becoming organizations supporting and transporting smuggled goods. In the inns and goods yards, some even resell gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and engage in gambling and prostitution. Many goods yards raise or lower prices to deceive customers. As a result, many merchants say: "Business is not easy to do in Cangzhou!" The "leadership" of import and export market transactions is often in the hands of the inns, goods yards, and brokers, and speculative funds are also hidden in the goods yards to engage in speculation and profiteering.

In the past, the Municipal Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce did not manage and lead the goods yards. The inns and goods yards were established randomly and were not registered. Rongji was opened by three opium smokers. Many goods yards had no funds and no guarantees. In July, Mao Sheng's manager, Jia Yuzhen, ran away with 8 million yuan belonging to other people. Although a convention for goods yards was established in October, in the same month, Xin Sheng's manager, Shi Lei, ran away with more than 1 million yuan from the counter and customers. In November, Qinghe's manager, Fan Qingyan, ran away with 200 sheepskins, a bicycle, and more than 1.8 million yuan belonging to customers. Xin Mao's manager also ran away after losing customers' money. These events have made merchants feel the danger of "no guarantee."

After discovering these problems, the city's leading organs gradually felt the seriousness of the weak management of the goods yards. In November, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce handled the application and registration of inns, goods yards, and cart inns, requiring security and counter-security, and educating the goods yards. However, in terms of management, no due control has been given to those who violate the law. In the future, it is necessary to earnestly strengthen leadership and management, and further clarify the Party's industrial and commercial policies among the inns, goods yards, and all merchants: legitimate operations are allowed to develop, and illegitimate operations must be restricted.

　　沧州市有些客货栈
    投机倒把欺骗客商
  　市政府应加检查管理
    【冀中讯】沧市在出入口贸易上，客货栈起了一些作用。广源客货栈八个月经营四十多万斤红枣出口；同兴货栈六个月出口红枣二十六万多斤，瓜子一万九千多斤，山药三万多斤，草帽辫二万五千五百多斤、羊毛一十二万九千多斤，羊皮六千四百七十三张。因此，许多货栈都很赚钱。但是客货栈行的违法投机、倒把、拐骗货款的事情也不断发生。这里的客栈和货栈不分，除个别的专营枣、梨、山货、山药外，一般都是从山货土产到外货、食盐、粮食，什么也经营，连大车店和某些旅馆、饭馆也挂着“代客买卖”的牌子。经营皮毛、猪鬃、山药，好些货栈都是外行，有时代客商买了假货，就欺骗了商贩；一般的货栈都成交和隐藏私货、变成组织、支持转运私货的机关；客货栈里，有些还倒卖金银外汇，聚赌窝娼；不少的货栈抬高或压低物价，欺骗客商。因此有好些客商说：“沧州买卖不好作！”出入口市场的交易“领导权”常常握在客货栈、跑合的手里，投机的游资也隐蔽在货栈里投机倒把。
    过去，市政府工商局对货栈没有管理和领导。客货栈胡乱成立，也不登记。荣记是三个抽大烟的开的。许多货栈没有资金，又没保证。七月，发生茂胜经理贾玉珍拐跑了人家八百万。虽然在十月订出了货栈公约，但在当月新生经理石磊又拐跑了柜上和客商的一百多万。十一月，庆和经理范庆言拐跑了客商的羊皮二百张，自行车一辆，款一百八十多万。新茂经理亏了客人的款子也跑了。这些事件，都使客商感到“没保障”的危险。
    该市领导机关发现这些问题后，逐渐感到货栈管理薄弱的严重性。十一月，市工商局办理客货栈大车店的申请登记，取保对保，对货栈进行教育。但是在管理上，还没有给违法的以应有的管制。今后应该切实加强领导管理，在客货栈和一切商人中间，进一步明确党的工商业政策：正当经营的允许发展，不正当经营的一定加以限制。
