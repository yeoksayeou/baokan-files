  　Oppose Tito's Terrorist Actions
  　Yugoslav Students Studying in the Soviet Union Firmly Refuse to Return Home
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, Sofia dispatch: The editorial department of "Workers' Cause," the organ of the Bulgarian Communist Party, recently received a letter from Belgrade University students addressed to the democratic youth of the world. The letter states: "Six months have passed since the Cominform's decision was announced. The students of Belgrade University, who have always been loyal to communism and international proletarian solidarity, have declared their support for this decision. The traitorous leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party, knowing that the students have always followed and will continue to follow the path of Marxism-Leninism, launched a sudden attack on the students. Most progressive students and keen communists have been beaten, expelled from the Party and the university, and arrested. The arrested comrades are subjected to abuse, torture, and starvation in prisons. More than 250 students have been arrested to date. No one knows what will happen to them. We appeal to you to assist us in our struggle so that our Party can return to the fraternal family of Communist Parties. Please speak out against the expulsion of true communists from the university and against the arrest of those who are loyal to the teachings of Lenin and Stalin. Long live the Cominform! Long live Comrade Stalin!"
    Another dispatch: Some personnel from the Yugoslav Embassy and Military Mission in the Soviet Union demanded that the 700 Yugoslav students studying in various universities in Leningrad return home, threatening them with deprivation of citizenship and expulsion from the Party. However, these students, in a recently passed resolution, refused and angrily denounced the Tito clique's traitorous policies.

  　反对铁托恐怖行动
  　留苏南国学生坚拒返国
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚共产党机关报工人事业报编辑部，顷接获贝尔格莱德大学学生告全世界民主青年书。该书宣称：“自从情报局决定公布以来，迄今已有六月之久，始终忠于共产主义与国际无产阶级团结的贝尔格莱德大学学生，已宣布拥护这一决定。南共叛变的领导机构知道学生们始终遵循着且将继续遵循马列主义的道路，因此就对学生进行突然的进攻。大多数进步学生和锐敏的共产党员，被殴打、被开除出党和大学，并遭受逮捕。被捕的同志在监狱中受到虐待、酷刑与饥饿，迄今已有二百五十余名学生被捕。没有谁知道他们会有什么遭遇。我们谨向你们呼吁：协助我们斗争以便使我党重返共产党的兄弟大家庭之中。请你们大声疾呼反对将真正的共产党员开除出大学，反对逮捕忠于列宁、斯大林学说的人们。情报局万岁！斯大林同志万岁！”
    又讯：南斯拉夫驻苏大使馆及军事使团的某些人员，曾要求在列宁格勒各高等学校学习的七百名南斯拉夫学生回国，并以剥夺公民权和开除党籍相威胁。但这些学生们在最近通过的决议中，已加以拒绝，并愤怒地痛责铁托集团的叛变政策。
