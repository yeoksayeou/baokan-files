Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army units on the Pingjin Front are actively carrying out various preparations for the siege and education on urban policies. The entire cadre, soldiers, and cooks of a certain unit's Second Company worked day and night to build fortifications. The hands of the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Squad were bleeding from grinding, but he still did not stop working. Kong Qingyu of the Seventh Squad of the First Company was sick, but he insisted on digging trenches. While digging, all the commanders and fighters of the company said with increased confidence: "If the fortifications are well-built, the enemy will not be able to escape." All the commanders and fighters of a certain unit who won the title of "Tiger of Siege" in the Jinzhou Campaign submitted the specific siege methods they had researched to the leaders of the unit, and guaranteed that everyone would be brave and tenacious, creating new glory on top of glory. At the mobilization meeting of a certain unit's battalions, they competed for the main attack mission, and unanimously expressed their determination to strictly abide by urban policies and discipline, and to win a great victory in politics as well. The Fifth Company of a certain regiment, by squad, automatically took a solemn oath to thoroughly implement policies and discipline, and to be a model People's Liberation Army soldier who is both militarily and politically proficient. The political instructor of the First Battalion of a certain regiment introduced the customs and habits of the people of Pingjin to all the soldiers of the battalion, and called on all the commanders and fighters of the battalion to abide by the customs and habits of the citizens and closely unite with the millions of citizens in the two cities after entering Pingjin.

Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 15th: Tianjin, a city with a population of over two million, is the first industrial and commercial city in North China. It, along with Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou, are known as China's four major commercial ports, ranking second only to Shanghai in the country. Tianjin is located on the eastern part of the Central Hebei Plain, with convenient land and water transportation. Tianjin is the confluence point of the famous Yongding River, Daqing River, Ziya River, Bai River, and the Grand Canal. These five major rivers converge and are called the Gu River, which enters the sea through Dagukou. By sea, it can reach Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Qinhuangdao, Huludao, Yingkou, Dalian, and other places. By river, it can reach Cangxian, Dexian, and Linqing along the Grand Canal to the south, and Xiongxian area along the Daqing River to the west, and Tongxian to the northwest along the Bai River. In terms of railway transportation, Tianjin is the intersection of the Jinpu and Beining railways. The Jinpu Railway, which runs through Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, starts from Tianjin and reaches Nanjing via Jinan, Xuzhou, and Pukou to the south. The Beining Railway runs northwest through Tianjin to Beiping and northeast to Shenyang. The light and heavy industries in Tianjin include textiles, chemicals, matches, rubber, paper making, flour, oil refining, oil pressing, smelting, machinery, electrical engineering, hydro-power, radio equipment, tobacco, carpets, and other factories, totaling more than 4,600. Among them, the Tianjin Textile Company, which belongs to bureaucratic capital, is the largest in scale, with 220,000 spindles, accounting for one-tenth of the country's total. In terms of commerce, there are more than 28,500 businesses in the city, including hardware, chemicals, automobiles, food, clothing, cloth, hotels, and warehouses. Products from the Yellow River basin and various parts of Northwest Inner Mongolia are gathered and distributed here. The main export trade includes salt, wool, pig bristles, leather, peanuts, eggs, and soybeans. Tianjin has thirteen colleges and universities above the junior college level, including Nankai University, Beiyang Institute of Technology, and Tianjin Private University, with more than 4,000 students, and forty-eight middle schools, including Nankai, Yaohua, and Guangdong, with more than 20,000 students.
