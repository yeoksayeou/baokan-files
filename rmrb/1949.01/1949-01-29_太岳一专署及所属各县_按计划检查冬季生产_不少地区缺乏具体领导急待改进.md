Taiyue First Special District Office and Subordinate Counties
Inspect Winter Production According to Plan
Many Areas Lack Specific Leadership and Urgently Need Improvement

[Taiyue Telegram] The winter production work in the counties of the First Special District was deployed to the villages around November 20th last year. Recently, all counties have conducted inspections, and the Special District Office has also organized four working groups to assist in the work of Qin County, Anze County, Changzi County, and Tunliu County. According to the reports from the working groups and the reports from the counties, preliminary results have been achieved in the past forty days. For example, in manure accumulation: according to statistics from 24 villages in the second district of Qin County, 22 dan of manure have been accumulated per mu, which is 75% of the original plan of 30 dan per mu. According to statistics from 44 villages in the first district of Tunliu, an average of 22 dan has also been accumulated per mu, which is 59% of the original plan of 35 to 40 dan. It is estimated that the average for the entire district reaches about 50% of the original plan. If a concentrated effort is added in February, the original plan's requirements can be largely met. In terms of purchasing livestock: it is estimated that at least 1,000 head have been purchased with government assistance and by the masses themselves. However, there are still some shortcomings in the leadership work, so this work has not achieved the results it should have. These shortcomings must be overcome in order to complete the entire winter production plan. The main points are as follows: 1. Some places do not take production leadership seriously, have a bureaucratic work style, and lack specific plans and specific organizational work. They only hold one or two meetings to appeal, or only make general statistical surveys. This problem exists from the Special District Office to the counties, districts, and villages. For example, Anze County only talked about a set of principles at the meeting to deploy production work. At the meeting to inspect production work in Qin County, when manure accumulation was mentioned, everyone thought there was nothing to do; when firewood and charcoal accumulation were mentioned, everyone thought that heavy snow made it impossible to do; when weaving was mentioned, it was thought that there was a lack of fuel and it was too cold at home to carry it out; when repairing farm tools was mentioned, everyone said that they did not understand the situation and would investigate. But they did not investigate. The villages are also the same. For example, a village cadre in Qin County said: "We must solve the specific problems of the masses according to the specific situation." However, they only held a meeting and told the masses in general terms: "There are four major tasks in winter production, and everyone must work hard." In this way, the masses say: "If this is the case, we don't need your leadership, we can produce by ourselves." From these facts, it can be seen that this bureaucratic work style will cause production work to fall into spontaneity and fail to complete the plan. The main reason for this bureaucratic work style is that our leadership from the Special District Office to the county has consistently adopted a general approach, failing to analyze specific situations, and consistently making general appeals, failing to do specific organizational work. Especially in production work, even if there is no leadership, the masses will still carry out some production activities themselves, which has become an excuse not to organize specifically. 2. The burden work has not been done well, and some unfair burden phenomena have occurred, which has affected the production enthusiasm of some of the masses. For example, the district chief of the fifth district of Tunliu unilaterally took care of the mountainous areas and privately decided that the yield per mu in the district should be reduced by five sheng across the board. This greatly reduced the burden per mu and greatly reduced the burden area, increasing the burden on some farmers. Some newly freed farmers ran to the farmers' association to return their land because the burden was too heavy. Although these are individual households and individual areas, they have a great impact on production and dampen the enthusiasm of the masses.

According to the above materials, the main task for leading winter production at present is to overcome bureaucracy, strengthen specific leadership, deeply understand the situation, and solve specific problems. 1. Determine the focus of work each month and formulate a plan to carry it out according to the plan: for example, the focus in January is manure accumulation. Cadres should be assigned in each village to be responsible for supervising and organizing by region, and they should start from themselves to promote everyone. 2. The county should divide the areas into types, determine the work focus and specific requirements for various different villages, create experience, and promote the general. Finally, the places where unfair burdens have caused problems and affected the production enthusiasm of the masses should be corrected.

　　太岳一专署及所属各县
  　按计划检查冬季生产
    不少地区缺乏具体领导急待改进
    【太岳电】一专区各县的冬季生产工作，去年十一月二十日前后都已布置到村。最近各县都作了检查，专署也组织了四个工作组，到沁县、安泽、长子、屯留等四个县去帮助工作。根据现在工作组的汇报和各县的报告，在四十天当中，确已得到了初步成绩。象在积肥上：沁县二区二十四个村统计，已经积肥每亩二十二担，按原计划每亩三十担，已完成百分之七十五。屯留一区四十四个村统计，每亩平均也积了二十二担，按原计划三十五到四十担，已经完成百分之五十九。估计全区平均达到原计划的百分之五十上下，这样再加上二月份的突击，大体上可以完成原来计划的要求。在添购牲口上：政府帮助买的和群众自己买的估计至少有一千头。但领导工作上还存在些缺点，所以还没有把这工作做出应有的成绩，也必须克服这些缺点，才能完成全部冬季生产计划。主要的有下面几点：一、有些地方对生产领导不认真，有官僚主义作风，缺乏具体计划和具体的组织工作，只是召开一两个会议，号召一下，或者是只作一般数目字的调查。从专署到县、区、村都有这样的毛病。象安泽县在布置生产工作的会议上，光讲了一套道理。沁县在检查生产工作的会议上，提到积肥，大家认为没啥可干；提到积柴、积炭，大家认为天下大雪，不能干；提到纺织，又认为缺乏烧的，家里太冷，也没办法开展；提到修补农具，大家说还不了解情况，调查调查再说。可是他们又不调查。村里也是如此，象沁县一个村干说的：“要根据具体情况，解决群众的具体问题。”可是只开个会，笼统的给群众说：“冬季生产四大任务，大家要好好干。”这样群众都说：“要是这样，就用不着你们领导，我们自己也会生产。”从上边这些事实里可以看出来，这种官僚主义的作风，会使生产工作陷入自流，不能完成计划。产生这种官僚主义作风的原因，最主要的是我们从专署到县里，在领导上一贯的是一般化的作风，不会分析具体情况；一贯的是一般号召，不会做具体的组织工作。特别是在生产工作上，就是不领导，群众自己也要进行一部分生产活动，这样也就更成了不去具体组织的借口。二、负担工作没作好，发生了一些负担不公现象，使一部分群众的生产情绪受到影响。如屯留五区区长片面照顾山地，并私自决定该区产量每亩一律降低五升。这样就使负担亩大大减少，负担面大大缩小，加重了一部分农民的负担，使某些新翻身的农民因负担太重，跑到农会交地。这些虽然是个别户、个别地区的事，可是对生产影响很大，打击了群众的生产情绪。
    根据上面的材料，目前对冬季生产的领导上主要是克服官僚主义，加强具体领导，深入了解情况，解决具体问题。一、每月确定工作重点，并订出计划，按计划进行：如一月份的重点是积肥，在各村要指定干部分地区负责督促、组织，并从干部自己做起，推动大家。二、县里要按地区分出类型，定出各种不同村庄的工作重点和具体要求，创造经验，推动一般。最后，因负担不公发生了毛病，而影响了群众生产情绪的地方，应该设法纠正。
