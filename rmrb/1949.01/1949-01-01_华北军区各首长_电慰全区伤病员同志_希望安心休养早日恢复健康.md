　　North China Military Region Leaders
  　Send a Telegram to Comfort Wounded and Sick Comrades Throughout the Region
    Hoping They Will Recuperate in Peace and Recover Their Health Soon
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] On New Year's Day, the leaders of the North China Military Region sent a telegram to express their sympathy to the wounded and sick comrades of all corps, military regions, and the 14th Column. The original telegram is as follows: Dear wounded and sick comrades:
    The joyous New Year of 1949 has arrived. We would like to extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to the comrades who were gloriously wounded in battle and fell ill due to overwork!
    In 1948, in the great victory of the People's Liberation War, you participated in the great, patriotic, and victorious battles and work against Chiang Kai-shek with your own active efforts, loyalty, bravery, and selfless sacrifice, and made many contributions. Your spirit of self-sacrifice for the victory of the people's liberation cause is worthy of emulation by the entire army, and you are very glorious.
    Chairman Mao told us that it would only take about a year to fundamentally defeat the Kuomintang. Recently, our victories in various battlefields across the country, one after another, especially the great victories on the Huaihai Front and the Tianjin-Peiping Front, solidly prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's estimate. Therefore, today, the entire army, inspired by the victorious situation across the country, should and will unite as one, intensify efforts, and strive for the early arrival of national victory. We hope that the comrades, rejoicing and encouraged, will peacefully recuperate, not be arrogant or impetuous, abide by discipline, and obey hospital management in order to strive for an early recovery and return to the front line to complete the glorious task of liberating all of China.
    We are constantly thinking about your health and recovery. In addition to warmly comforting you, we will give each person a pound of comfort meat during this festive season as a token of our appreciation. We wish you an early recovery of your health.
　　Respectfully,
    Salute!
    Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Xu Xiangqian, Teng Daiyuan, Xiao Ke, Zhao Erlu, Wang Shiying, Luo Ruiqing, Cai Shufan

    一九四九年新年佳节来了，我们谨向在战斗中光荣负伤，在工作中积劳成病的同志们，致崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问！
    一九四八年在人民解放战争的伟大胜利中过去了，你们以自己积极努力，忠诚勇敢，不惜流血牺牲的模范行动，参加了伟大的反蒋爱国的胜利的战斗和工作，有很多贡献。你们这种为人民解放事业的胜利而自我牺牲的精神，值得全军学习，你们是非常光荣的。
    毛主席告诉我们，只要再有一年左右的时间，就可以根本上打败国民党。最近我们在全国各个战场上，一个连着一个的胜利，特别是淮海前线和平津前线的伟大胜利，扎扎实实的证明着毛主席这个估计的正确。所以今天全军上下，在全国胜利形势的鼓舞下，都应该而且也一定会团结一致，加紧努力，以争取全国胜利早日到来。我们希望同志们欢欣鼓舞的为了争取早日恢复健康，重返前线，完成解放全中国的光荣任务而安心休养、不骄不躁、遵守纪律、服从医院管理。
    我们经常在惦念着你们的健康复原，除热烈慰问你们外，特在这年节时，给每人发一斤慰劳肉借以慰劳，祝早日恢复你们的健康。
