Today, I am honored that so many guests, comrades, and students have come to celebrate my seventieth birthday. I think it would be more meaningful to share some of my reflections on my revolutionary journey at such a grand gathering.

I have been engaged in revolutionary movements for four or five decades. The last fifty years have been the final stage of capitalism – the era of imperialism from its formation and full development to its approaching demise, which was also the era when imperialism's aggression and oppression against China were at its most severe. At the same time, it was an era of arduous struggle for China's national and democratic revolution to win liberation. Since the victory of the Russian proletariat's October Revolution in 1917, it has marked the beginning of the collapse of the capitalist system. However, for nearly thirty years, only the Soviet Union was the sole socialist country. After World War II in 1945, European countries such as Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, and Yugoslavia broke away from the capitalist system and established new democratic systems. In dependent and colonial countries, the national liberation movement is advancing by leaps and bounds. Especially in China, a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and more than two years of the war of liberation against feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic-comprador capitalism, we have achieved a great victory. In the liberated areas of half of China, the rule of feudalism, imperialism, and feudal-comprador fascism has been eliminated, and a brand-new, people's democratic new democratic society has been established. This means that since the victory of the anti-fascist World War II, not only have major changes taken place in Europe, but also fundamental changes have taken place in Asia. Especially in China, even greater changes have occurred. This change is taking place at an accelerating pace and on a scale of leaping mutations.

In modern times, China's first and most powerful enemy was foreign imperialism. However, our great Chinese nation has the ability to defeat foreign aggressors. In the past, the Xiongnu, Turks, Wuhu, Khitan, Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties invaded China, and they were all defeated by China, not to mention them for the moment. Even the powers of modern capitalism, then imperialism, and then fascism invaded China, and they have all been defeated, or are in the process of being defeated. Historical facts prove that the closer the years of the powers' invasion of China, the more fierce and cunning they become, and the more blatant and unscrupulous they are. But the more fierce they are, the more miserable their defeat, and the faster the time of their defeat is accelerated: The British Empire has gradually intensified its oppression of China since the Opium War, and it has failed in about a hundred years; Japanese imperialism has wanted to destroy China since the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. After the "September 18th" and "July 7th" armed attacks, a large part of China's territory was really occupied by it, but it failed after just fifty years, the time was shortened by two times, and the failure was even more miserable; Since World War II, American imperialism has wanted to annex the whole of China as its colony, and has fostered China's traitor Chiang Kai-shek as its tool against the Soviet Union and the Chinese people, providing him with a large amount of arms and money to enable him to carry out an anti-people civil war, occupying China's territorial waters, territories, and airspace as its naval, land, and air force bases against the Soviet Union. However, its crazy aggression has suffered a serious blow from the Chinese people in just three years. If it does not change its policy of aggression against China, it will probably not exceed five years, and it will completely fail. The time has been shortened by twenty times, and the failure will be even more miserable.

Historical facts also prove that in the last fifty years, China's traitors have also become more and more ferocious, their ambitions have become more and more arrogant, and their failures have become more and more tragic: Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty betrayed the country and arrogantly said: "Rather give it to friendly countries than to domestic slaves." She wanted to preserve the small court under the iron heels of imperialism, but the small court could not be preserved, but instead caused the complete demise of the Qing Dynasty; Since the establishment of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai betrayed the country and wanted to be the son-emperor of Japanese imperialism, but he failed without becoming a son-emperor, and the failure was very miserable; Wang Jingwei betrayed the country and wanted to be a pawn of Japanese imperialism's so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," but he failed without becoming a pawn, and the failure was even more miserable; Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the country and wanted to be the outpost of American imperialism against the Soviet Union and communism, but he failed again without becoming an outpost, and the failure will be even more miserable.

Historical facts further prove that no matter whether it is British capitalism's opium goods plus warships and cannons, Japanese imperialism's cheap Japanese goods plus airplanes and tanks, or American imperialism's arms money plus atomic bombs, as long as the Chinese people are awakened and united, they are an invincible force. As long as China, a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country with 450 million people, is liberated, it will inevitably promote the liberation movement of colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world to advance by leaps and bounds, and it will inevitably accelerate the overall liberation of the 1.2 billion oppressed people in Asia.

In the past fifty years, scientific inventions and human progress have been developing by leaps and bounds at an increasing speed, shortening the world's space and time: It used to take several years, or at least several months, to travel around the earth, but now it only takes a few days by plane; Previously, news of major events in the world took years or months, or at least a few days, to spread to all parts of the world, but now it only takes tens of minutes, or even a few minutes, to spread through radio broadcasts. All sciences have greatly advanced, and mankind has reached an era where it can conquer nature even better. Human knowledge has become more developed, and the era of man exploiting man, man oppressing man, nation oppressing nation, and white people oppressing colored people has passed. If the victory of the October Revolution shattered the weakest link in the chain of imperialism's shackles on the world, then the liberation of the 1.2 billion oppressed people in Asia shattered the strongest link of imperialism, because the establishment of imperialism is mainly based on the existence of colonies and semi-colonies. The liberation of colonies and semi-colonies is the solution to the "unity of opposites," eliminating one side, and the other side must be eliminated. Therefore, imperialism must also be doomed to death. Fascism was conceived from the embrace of imperialism, and imperialism was conceived from the embrace of capitalism. The madness and ferocity of fascist executioners is imperialism's death throes, and imperialism's monopoly rule and parasitism and corruption are manifestations of capitalism's dying. Fascism is dead, imperialism must be doomed to death, imperialism is dead, capitalism must be doomed to death, and what will rise instead is inevitably socialism to communism. This is the law of historical development, and whoever wants to stop the wheels of history from moving forward will be crushed.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" by the greatest giants of mankind, Marx and Engels. The development of world events and the Chinese revolution now proves that the realization of communism is not far off. The "Communist Manifesto" points out the path of development of human society. This path is the law of historical science developed by Marx's genius, gathering the wisdom of mankind since history in a scientific way. The reason why our People's Liberation Army has been able to achieve glorious and great victories is because this army is led by the Communist Party of China and is an army fighting for the liberation of the people, and the Communist Party of China is led by Chairman Mao, who is proficient in Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, we firmly believe that our revolution will surely be victorious!

I am very fortunate to be born in this era, not only because the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism shines on us, but also because we have the guidance of Chairman Mao, the brilliant revolutionary leader of China today. Now I am seventy years old, and I am an older generation in the modern Chinese revolution, but I always move forward with the times and never be a backward person in the times. I am willing to work harder to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought together with the young comrades, work hard to do revolutionary work, thoroughly overthrow the enemy, and strive for the realization of a new democratic new China. I also firmly believe that I will see the realization of China from socialism to communism, and share the happiness of communism with the younger generation after generation!

### 吴玉章同志在华大祝寿会上的讲话

　　吴玉章同志在华大祝寿会上的讲话
    今天承许多来宾、许多同志和同学们来庆贺我七十岁的寿辰，我想在这样大的盛会上，讲点我在革命经过中的一些感想，更有意义。
    我从事革命运动已经有四五十年了。最近五十年是资本主义最后阶段的——帝国主义由形成和充分发展至接近死亡的时代，也就是帝国主义侵略压迫中国最厉害的时代，同时又是中国的民族与民主革命艰苦奋斗、争得解放的时代。自从一九一七年俄国无产阶级十月革命胜利，已经标志着资本主义制度崩溃的开始，但是在将近三十年的时期内，还只有苏联是唯一的社会主义国家。到一九四五年第二次世界大战后，才有波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克、保加利亚、匈牙利、亚尔巴尼亚和南斯拉夫这些欧洲国家，脱离了资本主义制度，建立了新民主主义制度；在附属国与殖民地国度中，民族解放运动正在大踏步前进；特别在中国这个半封建半殖民地殖民地国家中，经过了八年的抗日战争及二年多反封建主义、反帝国主义、反官僚买办资本主义的解放战争，获得了伟大的胜利，在半个中国已获得解放的土地上，肃清了封建主义、帝国主义与封建买办法西斯主义的统治，建立了崭新的、人民民主的新民主主义社会。这就是说，在反法西斯主义的第二次世界大战胜利以来，不仅在欧洲起了重大的变化；而且在亚洲也起了根本的变化；特别在中国更起了绝大的变化。这种变化是在加速度的进行着，在飞跃突变的规模上进行着。　　
    近代中国第一个最强大的敌人是外国帝国主义，但是，我们伟大的中国民族是有能力打败外族侵略的民族。从前历史上的匈奴、突厥、五胡、契丹、辽、金、元、清等民族侵入中国，都被中国打败了，姑且不去说它。就是近代资本主义进而为帝国主义更进而为法西斯主义的列强侵入中国，也都被打败了，或正在打败它的过程中。历史的事实证明：列强侵略中国，愈到最近的年头，就愈加凶恶狡猾，越是明目张胆、肆无忌惮，但谁更凶恶谁就失败得更惨，失败的时间也更加速的快：大英帝国自鸦片战争以来，即逐渐加紧压迫中国，约有一百年的时间失败了；日本帝国主义自甲午中日战争以来就想灭亡中国，到“九一八”及“七七”武装进攻后，中国领土真的被它占了一大半，但刚刚满五十年的时间就失败了，时间缩短了两倍，而且失败得更惨；美帝国主义自从第二次世界大战以来，即想吞并全中国作为它的殖民地，豢养了中国的卖国奴才蒋介石，作为它反苏、反中国人民的工具，接济他大量的军火与金钱使他进行反人民的国内战争，占领中国的领海、领土、领空，作为它反苏的海陆空军基地，但它这样疯狂的侵略，不过三年的时间，就遭到中国人民严重的打击，如果不改变它的对华侵略政策，大约不会超过五年，它将要完全失败，时间缩短了二十倍，而且失败得将要更更惨。
    历史的事实又证明：最近五十年中国的卖国贼也是愈来愈凶恶，野心也是愈来愈狂妄，而他们的失败也是愈来愈悲惨：满清西太后卖国、狂妄地说：“宁赠友邦、不予家奴”。她想在帝国主义铁蹄之下保存小朝廷，小朝廷不能保，反而使满清彻底灭亡；民国成立以来，袁世凯卖国想作日本帝国主义的儿皇帝，儿皇帝未作成就失败了，而且失败得很惨；汪精卫卖国想作日本帝国主义所谓“东亚共荣圈”的小卒，小卒未作成就失败了，而且失败得更惨；蒋介石卖国想作美帝国主义反苏反共的前哨，前哨未作成又失败了，而且失败得将要更更惨。
    历史的事实更证明：无论英国资本主义的鸦片商品加军舰大炮也好，日本帝国主义的贱价日货加飞机坦克也好，美帝国主义的军火金钱加原子弹也好，只要中国人民觉悟起来，团结起来，就是不可战胜的力量。只要中国这个四万万五千万人民的半封建半殖民地殖民地的国家得到了解放，必然要推动全世界殖民地半殖民地解放运动更大踏步前进，必然要加速亚洲十二万万被压迫民族获得全体解放。
    最近五十年来科学的发明和人类的进步，一日比一日更加速度的突飞猛进，把世界的空间、时间都缩短了：以前环游地球一周需要几年、至少也需要几个月才能作到，现在有飞机只需要几天就作到了；以前世界上较大事变的新闻消息，需要几年或几月，至少也需要几天，才能传到世界各地方去，现在有无线电广播只要几十分钟、甚至是几分钟就传到了。一切科学都大大地进步了，人类已达到了更能征服自然的时代，人类的知识更加发达了，人剥削人、人压迫人、民族压迫民族、白色人压迫有色人的时代已经过去了。如果说十月革命的胜利是粉碎了帝国主义束缚世界锁链最弱的一环，那末亚洲十二万万被压迫民族获得解放就是粉碎了帝国主义最强的一环，因为帝国主义的成立是以有殖民地半殖民地为主要条件，殖民地半殖民地解放了就是“矛盾的统一”的解决，消灭了一面，另一面必然要消灭。因此，帝国主义也就必然要归于死亡。法西斯主义是从帝国主义的怀抱里孕育出来的，帝国主义又是从资本主义的怀抱里孕育出来的，法西斯刽子手的疯狂凶暴，是帝国主义临死的挣扎，帝国主义的独占统治和寄生性与腐化性是资本主义垂死的表现，法西斯灭亡了，帝国主义必归于灭亡，帝国主义灭亡了，资本主义必归于灭亡，代之而兴的必然是由社会主义到共产主义，这是历史发展的规律，谁要阻挡历史的车轮前进，谁就要归于粉碎。
    今年是人类最伟大的巨人马克思、恩格斯发表“共产党宣言”的一百周年，现在世界事变和中国革命的发展，证明了共产主义的实现是为期不远了。“共产党宣言”是指示了人类社会发展的道路，这种道路是由马克思的天才以科学的方法汇集了人类有史以来的智慧而发展产生出来的历史科学的规律。我们人民解放军之能够获得光荣伟大的胜利，就是由于这个军队是中国共产党领导的为人民解放而斗争的军队，而中国共产党又是由于精通马列主义的毛主席所领导的。因此，我们坚决相信我们的革命一定会得到胜利！
    我很庆幸生在这个时代，不但有马列主义普遍真理的照耀我们，而且还有现今中国的英明革命领袖毛主席亲身指导我们。现在我已七十岁了，是近代中国革命中更老的一代，但我总是随时代前进，绝不做时代的落伍者，我愿意和年青的同志们一道更加努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，努力做革命工作，彻底打倒敌人，为新民主主义新中国的实现而奋斗。我更相信：我将看到中国由社会主义到共产主义的实现，并和年青的一代又一代共同来享共产主义的幸福！
