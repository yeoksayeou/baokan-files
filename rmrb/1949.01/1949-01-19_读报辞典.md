　　Viet Minh – This is a unified front organization led by the Vietnam Communist Party, including various democratic parties and people's organizations. It is the core of leading the Vietnamese people in the national liberation movement. Its full name is "Vietnam Independence League." Its predecessor was the "Vietnam Liberation Committee," formed around the Viet Cong, and it was officially established in 1941. The leader is Ho Chi Minh, the President of the Republic of Vietnam. In the same year, the "Viet Minh National Salvation Program" was published, which was widely supported by the Vietnamese people. In September 1945, the Vietnam Revolutionary League, the Vietnam Nationalist Party, the Vietnam Democratic Party, and the Vietnam Socialist Party also joined. The Viet Minh has developed at an astonishing speed, and now has more than ten million members, accounting for one-half of the country's population. Its political program: In the political aspect, it guarantees the people's various freedoms and democratic rights, protects the interests of ethnic minorities, and establishes people's armed forces to defend the country's independence and integrity. In the diplomatic aspect, it abolishes unequal treaties, unites with oppressed nations in Asia, and jointly builds alliances to fight against the aggression of fascist imperialism. Economically, it re-divides public land, implements a planned economy, encourages national enterprises, improves national living standards, and popularizes education. It also established the Vietnam Democratic United Government and promulgated the "Democratic Constitution of the Republic of Vietnam," which was unprecedented in Vietnamese history. Currently, it continues to unite and lead all the Vietnamese people in resisting the French army's offensive.
　　Indonesian Mediation Committee – When the United Nations Security Council discussed the Indonesian issue in August 1947, the Soviet representative suggested organizing a Security Council arbitration committee to go to Indonesia to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian issue. However, due to American imperialism's use of the so-called "majority machine" to manipulate the Security Council's discussion, the resolution proposed by Chiang Kai-shek's representative was passed: that is, the Dutch and Indonesian sides each select one country, and then the two selected countries select a third country, and the three countries form a "Mediation Committee." As a result, Indonesia selected Australia, the Netherlands selected Belgium, and Australia and Belgium jointly selected the United States. From the composition of this US-Australia-Belgium "Mediation Committee," it is clear that it is not an impartial organization, that it has no sincerity in fulfilling its duties, and that it has not supervised the implementation of the ceasefire work announced by the United Nations Security Council on August 1, 1947. Moreover, they rejected the Soviet Union's just proposal in the Security Council that the Dutch and Indonesian troops withdraw to their pre-war positions, and instead helped Dutch imperialism invade Indonesia. The humiliating "Renville Agreement" was presided over by it and is purely a tool for American imperialism to invade Indonesia.

    越盟——是以越南共产党为领导的包括各民主党派及各人民团体的统一战线组织，是领导越南人民进行民族解放运动的核心，它的全名是“越南独立同盟”。它的前身是以越共为中心而组成的“越南解放委员会”，一九四一年正式成立。领袖是越南共和国大总统胡志明。同年发表了“越盟救国纲领”，得到广泛的越南人民的拥护。一九四五年九月，又有越南革命同盟会、越南国民党、越南民主党及越南社会党参加。越盟以惊人的速度向前发展，现在已有盟员一千万人以上，占全国人口的二分之一。它的政治纲领：在政治方面，保障人民各种自由民主权利，保障少数民族利益，建立人民武装保卫国家的独立和完整。在外交方面，废除不平等条约，与亚洲各被压迫民族联合，共建联盟以反法西斯帝国主义的侵略。在经济上，重分公田，实行计划经济，鼓励民族企业，改善国民生活，普及教育。并建立了越南民主联合政府，颁布了越南历史上所没有的“越南共和国民主宪法”。目前它继续团结和领导全体越南人民反抗法军的进攻。
    印尼调处委员会——一九四七年八月间联合国安理会讨论印尼问题时，苏联代表建议组织安理会仲裁委员会到印尼解决处理荷印问题，但因美帝国主义利用所谓“多数机器”操纵了安理会讨论，结果通过了蒋匪介石代表所提的议案：即由印荷双方各选一国，再由这被选的两国再选一国，三国组成“调处委员会”，结果印尼选澳大利亚，荷选比利时，澳、比又共选美国，这个美、澳、比三国“调处委员会”，从它的组成成份看，便可以明白它不是一个公正的组织，它绝无诚意履行它的职务，它也没有监督执行联合国安理会于一九四七年八月一日宣布的停战工作，而且它们更拒绝了苏联在安理会所提的荷印双方军队撤至战前位置的正义提议，而是帮助荷帝国主义侵略印尼，屈辱的“伦维尔协定”就是它所主持，纯粹是美帝国主义侵略印尼的一个工具。
