　　"Should Not Lightly Arrest or Beat People" Title
  　Unclear Meaning Easily Causes Misunderstanding Editor:
    In the previous period, the People's Daily Q&A column published a title: "Should not lightly arrest or beat people." At that time, I raised the following opinion: "Should not lightly arrest people" is correct, but "Should not lightly beat people" is not right. Because this sentence itself contains the element of being able to beat people.
    Our government has clearly stipulated that beating people is not allowed, and corporal punishment is abolished. The phrase "Should not lightly beat people" is problematic. However, on December 8th, on page 2, the Taihang Xinhua Daily editorial "Resolutely Oppose Illegal Detention and Beating of People" was published. This "title" I think has the same problem as last time—that is to say, "legal beating of people" is permissible. I request a response to this opinion.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Du Jinsheng, Cadre of the Military Law Department of the Second Artillery Brigade)Du Jinsheng Comrade:
    Regarding the opinions raised in your letter about the two titles "Should Not Lightly Arrest or Beat People" and "Oppose Illegal Detention and Beating of People," your opinion is correct. The meanings of these two titles are not accurate enough and can easily cause some misunderstandings. This is an oversight in our editorial work, and we will pay attention to it in the future.

### “不应轻易捕人打人”标题含义不明易引起误会

　　“不应轻易捕人打人”标题
  　含义不明易引起误会编辑同志：
    在前一个时期人民日报问答栏曾发表过：“不应该轻易捕人打人”的标题，当时我曾提出这样的意见：“不应轻易捕人”是对的，但“不应轻易打人”就不对了。因为这句话本身包含着可以打人的成份。
    我们政府有过明文规定，不准打人，取消肉刑，“不应轻易打人”的话是有毛病的。但在十二月八日二版，又发表太行新华日报的社论：“坚决反对非法扣打人”。这样“标题”我觉得和上次犯了同样的毛病——就是说“合法打人”是可以的。我这意见，要求给予答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（炮二旅军法处干事杜金生）杜金生同志：
    来信所提“不应轻易捕人打人”和“反对非法扣打人”两个标题的意见，你的意见是正确的，这两个标题含义都不够确切，且易引起某些误会。这是我们编辑工作中的疏忽，今后当注意。　　　　　　　　　——编者
