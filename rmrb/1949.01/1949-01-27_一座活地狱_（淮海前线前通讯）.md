　　A Living Hell
    (Frontline Dispatch from the Huaihai Campaign)
  　"Bird's-eye View" of Hell
    In an area of ​​more than ten *li* around Yongcheng in the southwest of Xuzhou and northeast of Henan and Anhui, from December 4th of last year to January 10th of this year, a living "hell" appeared for more than thirty days. In this "hell", there were no trees, no grains, no firewood, no roofs, no birds or beasts, and no sound of chickens or dogs barking. People lived in caves. On snowy days, they sadly used the white cloth of parachutes to block the snow and wind. All the coffins in the graves were dug out to be burned as firewood, and horse hides and wheat seedlings were used as food. This "hell," though only ten *li* square, had a population of more than 200,000. There were warlords, bureaucrats, capitalists, bankers, and landlords who had fled from Xuzhou with the bandit Du Yuming, as well as wives and young ladies brought by Bandit Du, and Kuomintang civil servants, teachers, students, workers, peasants, soldiers, peddlers, monks, actors, and prostitutes who had been deceived or captured. All kinds of institutions and figures in the "society" of the Kuomintang-controlled areas were present, a complete microcosm of the Jiang family "dynasty". The Du, Qiu, and Li bandit gangs concentrated all the sources of sin and all the "excellent traditions" of the Jiang family's small court in this small piece of land and "highly developed" them for more than thirty days.
    "Share Life and Death"! "Share Hardships"!
    The Du Yuming headquarters in "hell" shouted "Share life and death, share hardships" every day. But when the soldiers were gnawing on tree bark, seedlings, and horse bones in the freezing cold, freezing and starving to death in groups, and dying from eating too much horse hide, the rulers of this "hell," the bandit chiefs Du, Qiu, and Li, were still eating rice, biscuits, milk, foreign sugar, and American canned goods every day. Bandit Jiang used American planes to "specially airlift" these precious goods to them. Anyone who picked them up and did not hand them over was immediately shot. Officers above the rank of division commander could eat canned food, and company commanders could sometimes get a bowl of rice, but even if the soldiers desperately snatched something that landed in front of them, their superiors would immediately order it to be confiscated. The officials tried every means to hoard the confiscated food. Liu Shouren of the 8th Army Engineer Battalion said: "I had just grabbed a big pancake and took a bite when an officer from the headquarters ran up and slapped me twice in the face and snatched the pancake away!"
    "Black Market" and "Gambling Den"
    The greedy bandit gang, even when facing death, could not forget about money and actually did a large black market business inside the "hell". Officials directed "trusted aides" to use machine guns to sweep away soldiers and hoard the cigarettes, food, and steamed buns dropped by the planes, selling them to the soldiers at high prices. Initially, a silver dollar could buy four *jin* of airlifted steamed buns or a pack of cigarettes. After a heavy snowfall, when planes could not come, the "prices" soared. A big pancake cost five silver dollars, and a silver dollar could only buy one cigarette. The officials with the largest grounds made the most money, and the officers and soldiers stationed at the airport made a great deal of money. Some took the wheat they had robbed from the common people, ground it into flour for themselves, and then made bran cakes from the bran to sell to the soldiers. A soldier from the 8th Army Engineer Battalion, when extremely hungry, exchanged a gold ring for a big pancake and two wheat cakes from an official. Since money could buy food, everyone put things they didn't need up for auction. Some sold generals' uniforms to people who were freezing to death, and plain clothes to those who were planning to desert... Thus, a black market appeared near the Chenguanzhuang North Airfield, full of stalls, bustling with activity. Even broken coffin boards from ancient tombs were dug up and brought to the market. A sack of broken firewood could be exchanged for two bowls of rice. But in this market, Jiang's own gold yuan notes were worthless. A cigarette that cost one "silver dollar" cost 300 "gold yuan" notes, and it took fifteen "gold yuan" notes to buy a chili pepper. Later, the sellers simply refused to use them. The officials, unable to spend the money they had scraped together before death, gambled frantically. Gambling was rampant, and their caves were full of *pai gow*, playing cards, *mahjong* tiles, silver dollars, gold yuan notes... The "black market" at the airfield also served as a casino, where two or three hundred people gathered to gamble every day, betting ten silver dollars or 30,000 gold yuan notes at a time.
    World of Robbers
    In this "hell", the Jiang bandit troops each planned for themselves, wanting food and money, so they cruelly robbed and killed each other, creating a terrifying world of robbers. Those without power or guns suffered the most. First, the large number of young students, Kuomintang public employees, and even local officials and unemployed military officers who had been coerced out of Xuzhou became the main targets of robbery. More than 800 students from Xuzhou Municipal Middle School did not receive a single grain of rice every day. The few coins they brought from home to buy some rice were snatched away by the bandit troops as soon as they were cooked. Unable to bear the hunger, they risked trying to escape from under the machine gun fire of Du bandit's "督战队" (supervisory troops), many were shot and killed on the position. One morning, an officer ordered more than two hundred civil servants and clerks scattered on a certain slope to gather for "awaiting orders to join the army". As soon as they gathered, the officer pulled out his pistol and, at his command, the bandits immediately started stripping them of their clothes. Two civil servants from Guangdong protested angrily and were stabbed more than a hundred times to death by a group of bandits. The remnants of the 70th Army and other units went everywhere to loot things and took them to the "market" to exchange for food. The "剥猪猡" ("pig peelers," slang for ruthless con men) of Shanghai could run rampant here day and night without restraint. Many people bought sets of plain clothes to try to escape, but they were stripped off, then bought again, and then stripped off again. Ms. Tang Ci, who used to be a teacher at Chongzhen Elementary School in Luoyang, was "searched" seventeen times on the way out. She was stripped of everything, even her cotton pants. Many women who escaped were also stripped down to only a pair of shorts. Workers, students, public employees, landlords, bosses, merchants... rushing towards the PLA positions in groups, braving Jiang bandit's machine gun fire, were all robbed clean.
    The property of the local people had been robbed even earlier. Their clothes were worn by the bandit troops, firewood, furniture, wooden pillars, door frames, and roofs were burned for cooking, and the grain was robbed and eaten. But they were still hung up and tortured until they could not produce anything more. Even among "their own people", they were fighting a "life-or-death" struggle. One day, a car carrying several officials' wives passed by. There were several cans of biscuits in the car, and a battalion of soldiers rushed forward and snatched all the biscuits. A battalion commander named Xu saw this and took off his coat and squeezed in, but he didn't get any biscuits. Looking back, his coat had been snatched away by someone else. When the planes dropped grain, everyone ran to grab it. The planes continued to drop rice on top of the piles of people, killing people every day. Those who couldn't grab any in the back used machine guns to shoot, and then took the rice from the dead. Different units also robbed each other for grain with weapons. After the snow, near the Wangzhuang headquarters, the 8th Army and the 9th Army fought each other for grain, killing hundreds. On January 5th, in the area of the Chenguanzhuang North Airfield, an even greater massacre was caused by抢米 (robbing rice), where white rice and fresh blood were mixed together.
    Beasts in Hell
    The bandit gangs, facing imminent death, became even more barbaric and displayed their bestial behavior. In the headquarters of the bandit chiefs Du, Qiu, and Li, female students who had been captured often appeared. Hundreds of female students who had been deceived out of the Xuzhou area met a cruel fate. Driven by hunger, they reached out to the officials who had grain, and many were raped by these beasts while swallowing their tears in hunger and cold. Many "female clerks" and "female nurses"... were added to the army, division, and regimental headquarters. The bandit chiefs also cruelly used civilian women as sacrifices, indulging the troops in rape to encourage their subordinates and soldiers to fight to the death for them. When Bandit Qiu Qingquan set out from Xuzhou and passed through Xiao County, he ordered the puppet Xiao County government to send more than two hundred women to be "military prostitutes". In Qinglongji, the women of the entire village were concentrated in several houses. At night, the bandit troops took matches and flashlights to pick out the young women to "grind", and later even teenage girls and old women in their forties and fifties were not spared. Later, even the families of many lower-ranking officers could not escape the ordeal of gang rape. Ding Saiheng of the 598th Regiment of the 200th Division of the surrendered Kuomintang 5th Army said: "At night, the women in each village cried and screamed miserably, as if they had arrived in hell."
    Ugly Rulers
    The creators and rulers of the "hell" - war criminal Du Yuming and the bandit chiefs Qiu and Li, etc., organized secret agents and established supervisory troops to monitor the actions of the soldiers on the front lines and force them to die for them. Bandit Du Yuming hid in his cave all day without speaking or seeing anyone. Bandit Li Mi was mentally deranged and panicked, hiding from one air-raid shelter to another, scolding his guards for building the air-raid shelters too flimsy. Bandit Qiu Qingquan hid in his cave enjoying a decadent and depraved life, selecting five female actors to sing "贵妃醉酒" ("The Drunken Concubine") and "玉堂春" ("Yu Tang Chun")... These rulers also fought each other, mutually excluding each other. Bandit Li scolded Bandit Qiu for unduly occupying most of the airlifted rice, leaving his troops to eat tree bark and wheat seedlings. Bandit Qiu scolded Bandit Li for bringing troops to rob grain by force. Bandit Du scolded Bandit Qiu for being arrogant and ignorant, while Bandit Qiu scolded Bandit Du for incompetent command...
    Debauchery, shamelessness, cruelty, greed... What is recorded here is only part of the material learned from a few prisoners of war. The actual content of this dark "hell" is ten thousand times richer than this. But isn't all this a most vivid microcosm of the Jiang family dynasty today?
    After the demons and ghosts in this "hell" ran rampant for thirty-seven days, they were finally destroyed by the powerful People's Liberation Army in a sweeping operation at dawn on the 10th.

　　一座活地狱
    （淮海前线前通讯）
  　地狱“鸟瞰”
    在徐州西南永城东北，界于豫皖苏三省之间，一块周围十余里的土地上，从去年十二月四日到今年一月十日的三十多天中，曾经出现过一座活的“地狱”。这个“地狱”内没有树木，没有五谷，没有柴草，没有屋顶，没有飞禽走兽，听不见鸡鸣狗叫，人们都生活在地洞里。下雪天，他们凄凉地撑起降落伞的白布来挡雪风，所有坟墓里的棺材都被挖出来当柴烧，马皮、麦苗当做食粮。这座“地狱”，虽只有十里见方，人口却有二十多万。这里有跟着杜匪聿明从徐州逃来的军阀、官僚、资本家、银行家、地主，有被杜匪带来的太太、小姐，还有被骗来或抓来的国民党公务人员、教员、学生、工人、农民、士兵、小贩、和尚、戏子和妓女。凡是国民党统治区“社会”所有的各种机构，各种人物，应有尽有，完全是蒋家“王朝”的缩影。杜、邱、李匪匪帮们，把蒋家小朝庭一切罪恶的渊薮，一切“优良传统”，都集中在这小块土地上，“高度发挥”了三十多天。
    “同生死”！“共患难”！
    “地狱”里的杜聿明指挥部，天天狂叫“同生死，共患难”。可是当小兵们在冰天雪地里啃树皮、青苗、马骨头、成群地冻死、饿死，吃马皮涨死的时候，这个“地狱”里的统治者杜、邱、李匪首们，还天天吃着大米、饼干、牛奶、洋糖和美国罐头。蒋匪把这些高贵物品用美国飞机“专机空投”给他们，谁拾到了不往上缴立即枪毙。师长以上吃到罐头，连长有时还可以分到一碗米，而士兵即使有降落到面前拚命抢到的东西，如果不迅速“分而食之”，他们的上峰就会马上来命令收缴。当官的并想尽一切办法将收缴的食品囤积起来。八军工兵营刘守仁说：“我刚抢到了一块大饼才咬了一口，司令部里跑出一个军官迎面打我两个巴掌，就把大饼抢了去！”
    “黑市”和“赌窝”
    贪婪成性的匪帮，死到临头，还是忘不了要钱，竟在“地狱”里面大做其黑市生意。当官的指挥“亲信”用机枪扫开士兵，把飞机丢下的香烟、粮食、馒头抢来囤积起来，以高价卖给士兵。最初一块银洋可买到四斤空投馒头或一包香烟。一场大雪，飞机不能来，于是“物价”飞涨，一块大饼要五块银洋，一块银洋只能买到一支香烟。场地最大的官员就最发财，驻守机场的官兵们生意就大为得法。有的把从老百姓家抢来的麦子，自己推面吃了之后，用麸皮做成面麸饼子卖给士兵。八军工兵营一个士兵，就在饿得不得过的时候，用一只金戒指向当官的换了一块大饼和两个麦饼子。有钱既可以买到吃的，于是大家把不要的东西都拿来拍卖了。有的将军服卖给快冻死的人穿，便衣卖给准备开小差的………，于是在陈官庄北飞机场附近，出现了一个黑市场，满地都是摊子，出出进进，居然热闹一时。陈年古代的坟墓里的破棺材板，都被扒出来搬上了市场。一麻袋碎木柴可以换到两碗大米。可是在这市场上，蒋家自己的金元券却不值钱，一块“银元”一支的烟，用“金圆”券买，那时就已要三百元，十五块“金圆”券才能买到一只大椒，到后来就干脆被卖主拒绝使用了。官员们在临死前刮的钱没处花了，便疯狂的赌博，赌风大盛，他们的地洞里到处可以看到牌九、扑克、麻将牌、银洋，金圆券………。飞机场的那个“黑市场”也就充作了赌场，每天在那里赌的一聚就是二三百人，一赌就得十块银洋，三万金圆券。
    强盗世界
    这座“地狱”里的蒋匪军，各人都为着自己打算，要吃、要钱，于是互相残忍地抢劫杀戮，造成一个恐怖的强盗世界。没权没枪的最吃亏，首先从徐州胁迫出来的大批青年学生、国民党公教人员，甚至地方官员、失业军官都成为主要劫掠的对象。徐州市立中学八百多名学生每天领不到一颗米，他们从家里带来的几个钱买了几颗米，刚煮好就被匪军抢去。他们饿得没法，冒险从杜匪底“督战队”机枪火网下，往“地狱”外面逃，很多被打死在阵地上。一天早上，一个官长叫散在某一斜坡上的二百多公务员、职员集合“待命补入部队”，刚集合好，官长便掏出了手枪，一声号令，匪徒们一齐动手、把他们身上的衣服都脱光，其中有两个广东籍的公务员气愤反抗，便被一群匪徒们用刺刀刺了一百多刀而死。七十军等部的残兵败将，到处大肆抢劫东西，拿到“市场”上去换了粮食吃。上海的“剥猪猡”，在这里可以不分昼夜横行无忌。许多人买套便衣想逃出来的，买了给剥掉，剥了又买，买了又给剥掉。曾任洛阳崇真小学教员的唐赐女士，一路跑出来就被“搜查”了十七次，什么都光了，连棉裤也被剥去，很多逃出来的女人也都被剥得只剩一条短裤。冒着蒋匪机枪奔向解放军阵地成群的工人、学生、公教人员、地主、老板、商人……，没有一个不被洗劫。
    当地老百姓的财产更早被抢光，衣服都穿到匪军的身上，柴草、家具、木柱、门框、屋顶被做饭烧光，粮食抢去吃光、可是还要被吊起来拷打，一直到再打不出一点东西为止，“自家人”之间也一样的在拚“你死我活”，有一天一辆汽车载着几个官太太走过，车上有几罐饼干，一个营的士兵便一拥而上，把饼干抢光了，一个姓徐的营长看见了，也脱下大衣挤进去，饼干没抢到，回头一看，大衣却被别人抢去了。那里飞机丢下了粮食，大家便跑来抢，飞机继续丢下米便压在人堆上，天天压死人。在后面抢不到的，便用机枪扫射，然后将扫死的人的米拿走。不同的单位之间也互相武装抢粮。下雪后，在王庄司令部附近，八军和九军因抢粮互相火拚，打死几百。一月五日，在陈官庄北空投场一带，因抢米造成了更大的屠杀，白米和鲜血混在一起。
    地狱里的野兽
    死到临头的匪帮们更加野蛮地，发挥他们的兽行。在匪首杜、邱、李的司令部中，经常出现着被抓来的女学生。数百名从徐州一带被骗出来的女学生，遭到了残酷的命运。她们被饥饿威逼着，去向那些有粮食的官鬼们伸手求食，许多便在饥寒交迫下吞声饮泣地被这些野兽奸污。军师团部增加了许多“女文书”、“女护士”……。匪首们还残酷地以民间妇女作牺牲品，放纵部队奸淫，以鼓励他们的部下和士兵替他们拚死。邱匪清泉从徐州出发路过萧县时，就向伪萧县县政府派了二百多妇女带来做“军妓”。在青龙集，全庄妇女被集中关在几间房子里，晚上匪军们就拿着洋火，打着电筒进去挑选年青的出去“推磨”，以后就是十几岁的女孩和四五十岁的老太太也难幸免。到后来许多下级军官的眷属也难逃轮奸之劫。投降了的国民党第五军二百师五九八团丁赛衡说：“一到夜里，各庄上娘们大哭大叫，十分凄惨，就象到了地狱里一样。”
    丑恶的统治者
    “地狱”的创造者统治者——战犯杜聿明和邱、李等匪首组织了特务，成立了督战队，到前线去监视士兵行动，强迫士兵替他们送死。杜匪聿明成天躲在地洞里不讲话，也不见人；李匪弥神经错乱，惊慌不定，从这个防炮洞躲到那个防炮洞，骂他的卫士防炮洞造的太不坚固；邱匪清泉躲在地洞里享受着荒淫糜烂的生活，挑选了五个女戏子唱“贵妃醉酒”“玉堂春”……，这几个统治者之间也勾心斗角，互相排斥，李匪骂邱匪不该强占大部空投下来的米，让他的部队吃树皮麦苗，邱匪骂李匪不该带兵来武装抢粮，杜匪骂邱匪夜郎自大，邱匪则大骂杜匪指挥无能……。
    荒淫、无耻、残忍、贪婪……此处所记的还仅是从少数俘虏中所了解的部分材料，这座黑暗“地狱”里的实际内容还要比这丰富万倍。但这一切不正是今天蒋家王朝一个最逼真的缩影吗？
    这座“地狱”里边的妖魔鬼怪在猖獗了三十七天之后，于十日拂晓在强大解放军的扫荡下，终于最后消灭了。
