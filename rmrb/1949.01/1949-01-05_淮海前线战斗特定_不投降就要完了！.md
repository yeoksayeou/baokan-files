Huaihai Front Battle Report

　　"If you don't surrender, you're finished!"

　　On December 11th of last year, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army erected several large banners urging the enemy to surrender, just 20 meters from the Wuzhuang position where the Eighth Army of the Li Mi bandit troops was entrenched. Miao, the deputy political instructor of the Third Battalion of the People's Liberation Army, used a loudspeaker to call out to the enemy. The surroundings were very quiet, and a gentle breeze carried the words clearly and distinctly into every gun hole and bunker around Wuzhuang. However, due to the close surveillance of the bandit leaders, only one enemy soldier sneaked over to surrender. The next day, the People's Liberation Army decided to launch an attack on the enemy in Wuzhuang who refused to surrender, and the loudspeaker issued a final warning: "Attention, enemy officers and soldiers on the opposite side! You have until 12 noon to come over and surrender, otherwise, the People's Liberation Army will concentrate its artillery fire, ......" The wind quickly carried the PLA's warning to the enemy position in Wuzhuang. After a moment of silence, a enemy soldier suddenly crawled out of the bunker in front and quickly crawled towards the PLA position. The enemy behind him fired several shots but missed. He ran into the PLA trench and shouted breathlessly: "Comrades of the People's Liberation Army! Please don't fire the artillery, the platoon leader sent me to negotiate the surrender." He took out a letter and gave it to Deputy Political Instructor Miao. The letter was written in pencil, and the handwriting was crooked and messy, obviously hastily written in a panic. The letter read: "Comrades of the People's Liberation Army, now a platoon in the bunker in front of us is willing to surrender to your unit, but we have a heavy machine gun sent by the higher-ups watching us from behind. They will shoot if we go over. Furthermore, we have two squads newly sent here by the company commander, so it is very difficult. We will definitely find a way to come over when we have the chance. Please don't fire the artillery, we ask your unit to protect our lives. If you attack, we will never fire our guns. Please keep it a secret for us. We wish your army victory." The letter was signed by Kong Fanyin, the platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Third Company of the 709th Regiment. The People's Liberation Army then told the messenger to go back and make contact. Just then, it was exactly 12 o'clock. The PLA artillery began firing according to orders. Two heavy mortar shells exploded in front of the enemy's forward bunker. When the messenger saw this, he anxiously shouted: "Comrade, don't fire the artillery, wait a little longer." The PLA comrade then called the battalion command post and asked the artillery to fire into the depth. Then the artillery began to fire beyond the two bunkers into the depth. The messenger then quickly took off his military cap and waved it wildly towards the opposite side. People in the bunkers on the opposite side also waved their military caps. Then fifteen people crawled out of the two bunkers one after another, carrying two machine guns and seven rifles, and quickly crawled towards the PLA position. As they crawled into the PLA position, the PLA's various artillery fires had begun to concentrate on bombing the Wuzhuang enemy who had rejected the PLA's final warning. The enemy's bunkers were blown up in the fierce artillery fire, with bricks and stones flying everywhere. These fifteen Kuomintang soldiers, who had just surrendered, looked back at the smoke-filled Wuzhuang, revealing a lucky look and clicking their tongues: "If we hadn't come over, wouldn't we have been finished!" That night, the People's Liberation Army occupied Wuzhuang and annihilated all the enemy defenders.

　　淮海前线战斗特定
  　“不投降就要完了！”
    去年十二月十一日，解放军某部在李弥匪部第八军困守着的吴庄阵地前沿二十米处，竖起了几幅对敌劝降的大标语。解放军三营缪副教导员，在那里用喊话筒向着敌人喊话。周围很沉寂，微风阵阵地把这些话，清朗地一字一句地送进吴庄周围每一个枪眼里、地堡里。但因匪首监视严密，只有一个敌人偷跑过来投降。次日，解放军决定向拒绝投降的吴庄敌人发动攻击，喊话筒发出了最后的警告：“对面敌军官兵注意！限中午十二时以前过来投降，要不，解放军集中炮火轰击，…………”风又很快地把解放军的警告送到吴庄敌军阵地。静了一会，突然前边地堡里钻出一个敌军士兵，迅速朝着解放军阵地爬来，后面的敌人连打了几枪没有击中，他一股劲跑入解放军交通壕，气呼呼地边跑边喊着：“解放军同志们！千万别打炮，排长派我出来接洽投降的。”他拿出一封信送给缪副教导员，信是铅笔写的，字迹歪斜杂乱，显然是在慌乱中仓促写成的，信上写道：“解放军同志们，现在我们前面地堡的一排，愿投降贵部，可是我们后边有上边派来的一挺重机枪看着我们，过来他们就打，再者我们上边还有连长新派来的两个班在此，所以非常艰难，有机会一定想法过来，你们千万不要打炮，我们请贵部保护我们生命，你们若攻，我们决不打枪，请你们千万为我们保守秘密要紧，并祝贵军胜利。”信上署名的是七零九团三连二排排长孔繁荫。解放军当叫送信的回去联络。正说着，时间已到了十二点正。解放军炮兵按照命令开始射击，二发重迫击炮弹在敌前沿地堡前面轰然爆炸，那送信的一看急得连叫：“同志，不要打炮，再停一会。”解放军同志便打电话通知营指挥所要炮兵向纵深射击，于是炮兵便开始越过两个地堡向纵深射击了。那送信的这时连忙脱下军帽，高举着向对面乱摇，对面地堡里也有人摇起军帽来，接着前面两个地堡里先后爬出了十五个人，带着二挺机枪和七支步枪，迅速向解放军阵地爬来。当他们爬进解放军阵地时，解放军的各种炮火已开始向拒绝解放军最后忠告的吴庄敌人集中轰击，敌人的地堡一个个在猛烈炮火里打得砖石乱飞。这十五个才投降的国民党士兵，回头望望烟火迷漫的吴庄，露着幸运的神色咋舌道：“咱不过来，也不就完了吗！”当晚解放军就攻占吴庄，全歼守敌。
