　　Students from Landlord Families
  　Can Participate in Work
    Comrade Editor:
    In my village, there are two landlords who were struggled against. Both of them are students. They returned home after the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1945, they came out to work, but were called back home due to mass movements. Now, both of them want to go out to work again. I don't know if they can. According to policies and laws, are people of landlord background who have been struggled against allowed to go out to work? Some comrades say that they must have a certificate or introduction from the district or village government. If so, it will be impossible to do. There is a great shortage of labor everywhere now. Not to mention landlords, even if middle and poor peasants want to go out to work, the district and village will not give an introduction. If an introduction cannot be obtained from the district or village, can they go out to work? Can revolutionary organs recruit landlords who have been struggled against to participate in work?
　　　　　　　　　　　　(Wang Zhengfu)
    Answer: Our policy towards intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant families is to strive for their transformation. Therefore, as long as they are willing to abide by government laws and decrees, support our Party's policies, do not engage in sabotage activities, and are willing to serve the people, we can allow them to participate in work. It is wrong for the district and village governments not to introduce them because of the shortage of labor. They should recognize that letting them participate in work is beneficial to the people's revolutionary cause. As for whether revolutionary organs and organizations can recruit them to participate in work, the principle is the same. However, we must be highly vigilant against them to prevent some bad elements from sabotaging, and at the same time, we should strengthen their transformation education. Do not put them in important work positions without a long period of testing.

　　地主家庭出身的学生
  　可以出来参加工作
    编辑同志：
    我村有两个被斗争过的地主，这两个人都是学生出身，抗战后回到家里，一九四五年出来参加工作，后因群众运动叫回家来，这两个人现在都想重新出去工作，不知能不能？依据政策及法令，是否允许被斗争过的地主成份的人出来工作？有的同志说必须有区村政权的证明或介绍才行。若如此，则根本不能办到。各地现在劳力很缺，不用说地主，即是中、贫农想出来工作区村亦不给介绍。如果取不得区村的介绍，是否可以出来工作？革命机关是否可以吸收被斗的地主来参加工作？　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　（王正甫）
    答：对地主富农家庭出身的知识分子，我们的政策是争取改造。因之只要他们愿意服从政府法令，拥护我党政策，不进行破坏活动，愿为人民服务，我们就可以允许他们参加工作。区村政府因劳力缺不介绍出来是不对的，应该认识让他们参加工作，是有利于人民革命事业的。至于革命机关团体是否可以吸收他们参加工作，道理也是一样的。但必须对他们提高警惕，以防止有些坏分子的破坏，同时并应对他们加强改造教育，不经过长期考验，不要放在重要工作岗位上。
