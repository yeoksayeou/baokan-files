　　Cao Qishun Deserts, Wife Expresses Dissatisfaction
　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] When a civilian laborer deserts, even his own wife looks down on him. Cao Qishun, a civilian laborer from Wujinzhuang, She County, who participated in the Taiyuan Campaign, secretly left the team and returned home. His wife was very surprised to see him and asked, "Has Taiyuan been captured?" When the village chief heard about it, he came to see him as well. Cao Qishun stammered, falsely claiming that "the platoon leader told me to come home and take a look." His wife said, "The harvest is done, and the land has been plowed. There are no difficulties at home. Didn't we send a letter to tell you that? What's there to see?" After his wife learned that he had deserted, she was very dissatisfied with him and asked, "How can you face the villagers?!" Cao Qishun felt guilty and didn't dare to go out for two days. The village has always had good work performance and has been praised by the county and district several times. This time, Cao Qishun's desertion made the villagers feel like it was "creating a stain on the village" and they reported it to the district office. On the way to the district, he couldn't even lift his head. Groups of men, women, old and young people discussed: Qishun ran away from the front. In the district, his wife brought him three cornbread cakes and a bucket of rice soup in the evening. He was very unhappy to see it and blamed his wife for not making good food. His wife said, "The soldiers are fighting at the front, and you ran back like you've done something great!?" Under these circumstances, the district chief patiently talked with him. Qishun remembered the situation before and after his liberation and felt he was very wrong. The next day, he returned to the front. He swore to the instructor, "Please punish me. In the future, I will definitely work hard to atone for my sins. If I don't complete the task, I will never go home!"

　　曹起顺开小差老婆也表示不满
    【本报讯】民工开小差，自己老婆也瞧不起。参加太原战役的涉县五金庄民工曹起顺，偷偷离队回了家，老婆一见很奇怪，问他：“太原打下来了？”村长听说也来看他，曹起顺假借“排长叫我回家看看”为词支吾，老婆说：“场都收了，地也耕了，家里没有困难，不是打信告诉你们了？看什么？”老婆知道他是开小差回来的以后，对他很不满意，问他：你怎么对得起乡亲！？曹起顺内心有亏，两天不敢出门。该村一向工作良好，几次受到县、区表扬，这次曹起顺开小差，村民都感到“给村中造污点”，报告了区公所。去区的路上，他连头也抬不起来，三五成群的男女老少纷纷议论：起顺是从前方跑回来的。在区里，晚上老婆送来三个玉茭饼子，一桶饭汤，他看了很不痛快，责备老婆为什么不做好饭食，老婆说：“人家战士在前方打仗，你跑回来有了功啦！？”在这些情况下，区长耐心和他谈了话，起顺想起自己翻身前后的情境，觉得太不对了，第二天便回前方去了。他对指导员发誓说：“请你处罚我吧，今后我一定努力工作，将功折罪，完不成任务，决不回家！”
