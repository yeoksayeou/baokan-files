  　The History of Whole-Village Native Cloth in Central Hebei
    In the cotton-producing areas of Wuji, Gaocheng, and Zhao, Luancheng counties, the textile industry is very developed. As early as a hundred years ago, there was a foundation of wooden looms for weaving cloth, but the output was small, mostly relying on small merchants to sell to mountainous areas. During the Guangxu period, Shanxi merchants set up specialized organizations here for centralized trading, and the native cloth industry developed rapidly. By 1919, most of the @ shuttles were changed to pull shuttles, and completely native yarn was changed to using "warp" with foreign yarn, and the native cloth brands were sorted out, and the quality and quantity were improved. At that time, Luancheng was the largest native cloth market, with eighteen calico shops, and the surrounding counties came here to sell, and could purchase more than 800,000 bolts of native cloth every year. The market was so prosperous that it was said, "Tie up your leggings at dawn, busy with bags at sunrise, sell native cloth at midday, and the thread is shining in the afternoon." Secondly, Guo Zhuang, Nan Meng and other towns sold about 8,000 bolts per market. At that time, a family of three or four, with capital to handle seven or eight bolts of cloth, could live without worrying about food and clothing, so the masses circulated the saying, "Not afraid of lean years, just afraid of weaving is not profitable."
    After the July 7th Incident, sales in the Northwest were stagnant; sometimes the enemy situation eased, and transportation was favorable, peddlers from the west of the road flocked to buy, and the price of cloth immediately rose sharply, and the quality quickly declined. Sometimes the enemy blockade was tighter and did not come for a long time, and the production of native cloth shrank. After May 1, 1941, many businesses closed down due to strict enemy control. Later, as the situation gradually opened up, the native cloth industry was able to recover considerably, but due to the lack of necessary support from the government, development was limited to a certain extent. Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, especially after the Liberation War entered its second year, the native cloth industry has achieved unprecedented development due to the expansion of sales channels, the improvement of rural economic conditions, and the vigorous support of state-owned stores. First of all, farmers were allocated land, and agricultural income supported sideline production, increasing the breadth of textiles. According to statistics from Gaocheng, there are now 11,000 looms and 32,000 spinning wheels, an increase of one-quarter compared with before the war. In some villages in Gaonan, Luandong and Zhao County, very few people spun and sold thread or wove and sold cloth before and after the incident, but now they are gradually increasing. In the Gaobei and Wuji areas, almost every household is spinning and weaving. In spring and winter, or when profits are appropriate, the looms and spinning wheels are often running day and night. In order to improve the quality of native cloth, various counties have carried out whole-village improvements one after another. Since the spring of the previous year, the Wuji County Federation of Cooperatives (later renamed the Promotion Society) has achieved the purpose of whole-village improvement by supporting the Jin-Hebei branch store (Xinxinghao) with funds and purchasing native cloth on its behalf. It started with Yangzhuang in Mingzhisi, which had the strongest textile foundation, organized textile groups, stipulated the standard of village cloth with a width of 1.2 chi, a length of 1.8 zhang, and a weight of 1.5 jin, and firmly grasped the appropriate profit of village cloth higher than non-village cloth, and ensured that sales were not a problem. At that time, the masses felt that weaving village cloth was more profitable and convenient, which stimulated their interest in weaving village cloth. The woven cloth was sent to the Federation of Cooperatives by group representatives or in rotation, and the money was distributed according to the price of the cloth. Those who ran errands received a certain amount of remuneration, which saved manpower and reduced expenses. Later, the experience was promoted to various villages, and textile groups increased day by day. In order to reduce trouble, the group leader combined the quality inspection of the cloth when collecting the cloth, made suggestions for slightly lower quality, and did not accept too poor quality; some group leaders even took the initiative to guide the technology in the cellars, promoting the unification of cloth quality. In some villages, the groups pooled funds to operate textile necessities and formed cooperatives. Last year, the Yufeng branch of the Central Hebei Trading Company and the Federation of Cooperatives called for a comprehensive improvement of the village, and completed the collection of the masses' old substandard cloth within a time limit to solve the financial difficulties of weaving households. Since then, the quality and quantity of native cloth have been further improved. In that year, the total amount of native cloth in Guo Zhuang (including Beisu) reached 1.2 million bolts, more than double that before the War of Resistance. Among them, those that meet the standard of the whole-village improvement, genuine brand cloth (Shiqi brand, Guangming brand) accounted for 80%, and those that meet the standard of the sub-brand (Feima brand) accounted for 15%. The long-standing habits of selling wet cloth and inconsistency between the inside and outside have also been eliminated. The Gaocheng Federation of Cooperatives printed and distributed notices to promote the improvement of the village, stipulating that red lines should be woven on both ends of the village cloth to distinguish between good and bad, and cloth samples should be hung at the door to buy according to the samples, which improved the quality of native cloth. Since last winter, the brand cloth (Bird brand) in Nanmeng market has maintained 50% of the amount of 11,000 bolts per market. After the initial improvement of Zhao Luan, the edges and ends of the native cloth have also been improved.
    The Deviations that Occurred and the Problems that Exist
    Last year, the largest native cloth market in Guo Zhuang experienced two situations of declining quality. In March, the establishment of the exchange resulted in the deviation of monopolizing native cloth transactions. The purchase of cloth was entirely under the control of Yufeng (a state-owned store in the Ninth District of Central Hebei), and the leadership of the whole-village cloth was relaxed. Prices continued to rise, and the price increase of the whole-village cloth could not keep up with the rise in prices. Weaving households could not buy back raw materials after selling cloth, so they sought profits from reducing materials and adulterating, and the quality declined. According to statistics from April, May and June, among the 197,000 bolts of native cloth on the market, genuine and sub-brand cloths were reduced to 70%, and substandard cloths rose to 30%. After review and correction, the quality and quantity quickly recovered. After October, it declined again. This time, in addition to being affected by the objective impact of the supply of native cloth falling short of demand, the main reason was the competition between Yufeng and Delong Store of the Jin-Sui Purchasing Department. They lacked the overall thinking of integrating business with the Promotion Society like Xinxinghao in the past, which not only guaranteed the quality of native cloth, but also drove production. Instead, they each took out funds to support two or three private cloth shops for competition, and did not abide by the jointly agreed prices. At the market day not long ago, Yufeng raised the top village price of 160,000 yuan per bolt to 167,000 yuan on the pretext that Delong raised the substandard cloth to the price of the village cloth. Delong discovered it and raised it to 168,000 yuan. The two sides quarreled over this. Later, the manager of Yufeng said to others: If he raises it to 200,000, I dare to raise it to 250,000. Private cloth shops naturally agreed with this practice in order to buy more and draw more handling fees, but this greatly reduced the difference in profit between good and bad cloth, and打击打击the enthusiasm for weaving good cloth. It seems that the quantity of brand cloth has not decreased, but the quality is much worse than before. Although the two sides have made reviews recently, they still cannot be resolved due to the lack of self-criticism, and it has become a major obstacle in the current whole-village native cloth.
    The Path to be Taken in the Future
    In the past two years, in the development process of the native cloth industry, there have been characteristics of profits sometimes high and sometimes low, and production sometimes tight and sometimes slow. Whenever stores purchase in large quantities, native cloth feels that supply falls short of demand. Once currency is tightened, native cloth production declines. This is mainly due to the fact that only the support of state-owned economic forces is emphasized, and the combination with the cooperative transportation and sales of organized masses is neglected. The only way to make up for this shortcoming is to develop cooperatives. In the past, Wuji Federation of Cooperatives paid attention to this issue, which not only guaranteed the quality, but also made it easy to find sales channels; not long ago, Gaocheng Promotion Society also discussed ways to support the native cloth industry: (1) Transaction relationship: reward organized collective delivery of cloth. For textile groups that deliver cloth collectively, the price is increased by 1,000 yuan of border currency per bolt, which is used as the group's savings after deducting the porterage fee of the deliverers. (2) Entrusted transportation and sales: The masses concentrate the cloth and entrust the Promotion Society to sell it elsewhere. In this way, after deducting the foot price handling fee, the masses make more money, and the Promotion Society can reduce the pressure on funds. (3) Mobilize and organize the masses to pool funds for transportation and sales, and the Promotion Society is responsible for branding and finding sales channels: Recently, the masses in Hanjiawa Village pooled 200 bolts of cloth to exchange for livestock in Shanxi, which are all very good.

　　我对冀中整庄土布发展方向的意见
    行军
  　冀中整庄土布的历史
    在无极、藁城及赵、栾等县产棉区，纺织业甚为发达。远在百年前即有木机织布的基础，但产量较小，多赖小商销往山地。光绪年间，山西商人在此地设有专门组织，作集中性交易，土布业日益发展。至民国八年，大部由＠梭改为拉梭，由完全土线改为“经”用洋线，并进行了土布牌号的整理，质量数量均有提高。当时栾城为最大的土布市场，拥有十八座花布店，周围各县多到这里出售，每年可收购土布八十余万匹。集市之盛，有“黎明上腿带，日出褡裢忙，已时销土布，午后线子光”之称。其次是郭庄、南猛等镇，每集销八千匹左右。那时三四口人，有倒腾七八个布的本钱，可以不愁吃穿，因此群众流传着“不怕过歉年，就怕纺织不赚钱”的说法。
    七七事变，西北销路滞塞；有时敌情缓和，调运有利，路西小贩即蜂拥而至，争着购买，布价立形高涨，质量即迅速降低。有时敌人封锁较紧，长久不来，土布生产即呈萎缩。一九四一年五一后，因敌严密统制，歇业者不少。后局面逐渐打开，土布业得以相当恢复，但因政府缺乏必要的扶植，发展有着一定限度。自日寇投降，特别是解放战争进入第二年以后由于销路的扩展，农村经济条件的改善，及公营商店的大力扶植，土布业获得空前发展。首先是农民分得土地，农业收入支持了副业生产，增加了纺织的广泛性。据藁城统计，现有织布机一万一千张，纺车三万二千辆，较战前增多四分之一。在藁南栾东及赵县的若干村庄，事变前后纺卖线织卖布的极少，现在也逐渐多起来，藁北和无极地区，几乎是家家纺织。春冬两季或利润适当时，多是机子纺车昼夜不停。为了提高土布质量，各县先后进行了整庄。前年春起，无极县联社（后改为推进社），通过冀晋分店（新兴号）资金的支持，以代购土布的方法，达到了整庄目的。开始是从纺织基础最强的明秩寺杨庄入手，组织纺织小组，规定尺二宽、丈八长、斤半重的庄布标准，切实掌握庄布高于非庄布的适当利润，并保证销路不成问题。当时群众都感到织庄布赚钱多，又方便，刺激了织庄布的兴趣。织出布来，由小组代表或轮流集中送到联社，回来按布价分款，跑腿者得一定报酬，这样节省了人力，又减少了开支。后来把经验向各村推广，纺织小组日益增多。有的为减少麻烦，组长在收布时结合检查布的质量，稍低的提意见，太差的不收；还有的组长自动到窨子里指导技术，促进了布的质量统一。部分村庄，小组集股经营纺织必需品，组成了合作社。去年冀中贸易公司裕丰分店和联社，又进行了全面整庄的号召，并将群众旧存的次布限期收完，以解决织户的资金困难，从此，土布的质量数量越加提高。当年郭庄（包括北苏在内）土布上量共达一百二十万匹，超过了抗战前一倍。其中够整庄标准正牌布（士奇牌、光明牌）的占百分之八十，够副牌标准的（飞马牌）占百分之十五。历年存在的卖湿布和内外不一致的习惯，也已杜绝。藁城联社会印发通告，推动整庄，规定庄布两头织上红线，以区别好坏，并在门口上挂出布样，照样子收买，提高了土布质量。去冬以来，南猛市场牌子布（鸟牌）已保持每集上量一万一千匹的百分之五十。赵栾经过初步整庄后，土布的边沿板头也均有改进。
    发生的偏向和存在的问题
    去年在最大的郭庄土布市场，曾呈现了两次质量下降的情势。三月交易所成立，发生了垄断土布交易的偏向，收布全归裕丰（冀中九分区公营商店）一家，对整庄布掌握领导放松，物价不断上涨，整庄布的提价跟不上物价的上升，织布户卖了布买不回原料，便从减料掺假中找利润，质量降低。据四五六月份的统计，在上量土布十九万七千余匹中，正副牌子布减为百分之七十，次布涨为百分之三十。后经检讨纠正，质量数量迅速恢复。十月以后，又日益下降，这次除受土布供不应求的客观影响外，主要是裕丰与晋绥采购处的德隆商店互相争购所造成的。他们缺乏象以往新兴号一样的通过业务与推进社结合，既保证土布质量，又带动生产的整体思想，而是各自拿出资金支持两家或三家私人布店，进行争购，互不遵守共同商定的价格。前不久的集日，裕丰借口德隆将次布提为庄布价钱，而把每匹十六万的顶庄价提为十六万七，德隆发觉又提到十六万八，为此双方吵骂起来。以后裕丰经理对人说：他如涨到二十万，我敢提到二十五万。对这种做法，私人布店为了多买多抽手续费，自然相当同意，但这就大大缩小了好布与坏布之间利润的差额，打击了织好布的情绪。看来牌子布的数量没有减少，其实质量较前差多了。近来虽然双方作过检讨，但由于缺乏自我批评精神，依然得不到解决，而成为目前整庄土布中的一大障碍。
    今后应走的道路
    近两年，在土布业的发展过程中，表现着利润时高时低，生产时紧时慢的特点。每逢商店大量收购，土布即感供不应求，一旦货币紧缩，土布生产即呈下降。这主要是由于只偏重国营经济力量的支持，忽视与组织群众合作性运销相结合所形成的。弥补这一缺陷只有发展合作社的道路。过去无极联社注意了此问题，不但保证了质量，而且容易找到销路；不久前藁城推进社也讨论了扶植土布业的办法：（一）交易关系：奖励有组织的集体送布。凡纺织小组集中送来，每匹加价边币一千元，除去送布者的挑费，作为小组的积蓄。（二）委托运销：群众将布集中起来，委托推进社到他处去卖，这样除去脚价手续费，群众比较赚钱多，推进社又可少压资金。（三）发动与组织群众集股运销，推进社负责打牌号找销路：近来韩家挖村群众集布二百匹，到山西换牲口，这都是很好的。
