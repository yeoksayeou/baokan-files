　　Everyone Mobilizes to Organize Spring Festival Literary and Artistic Works
    To the Editors of People's Daily:
    The Lunar New Year is approaching, and there is an urgent need to organize mass entertainment for the New Year, but we are troubled by the lack of entertainment scripts and materials from the cities, and we have been unable to start. Therefore, we are asking you for help, hoping to provide us with more materials in this regard (including those related to current affairs propaganda), and we are eagerly awaiting them.
　　The Propaganda Department of the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee

To the Propaganda Department of the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee:
    Regarding cultural entertainment materials for the New Year, the *People's Daily* has recently published *Turning Over to Happiness*, *Oppose the Three Hands*, *Compete for the Red Flag*, and *The Beasts Sue for Peace*, etc., all of which can be adopted at your discretion. At the same time, we hope that you will deeply mobilize workers and peasants to write, and mobilize comrades from various departments to do it themselves, give full play to collective strength, and do a good job in holiday entertainment. Currently, the Liberation War is achieving unprecedented victory, and our region's land reform has been thoroughly completed. The Spring Festival celebration of victory and troop appreciation will be a grand occasion. We hope that you will seize the opportunity to report and send various propaganda works to us for selection and publication.

　　大家动手组织春节文娱作品人民日报编辑同志：
    旧历年关在即，急需很好的组织群众年关娱乐，但我们苦于无城市方面的娱乐剧本材料，至今无法着手进行。因此向你们求助，望多供给我们这方面的材料（时事宣传方面的也可），我们在热烈的期待着。
　　邢台市市委宣传部刑台市委宣传部：
    新年文化娱乐材料，本报最近刊载的有：翻身乐、反对三只手、争红旗、及野兽求和等，这些都可供你们斟酌的采用。同时希望你们深入发动工人农民写作，并动员各部门同志亲自动手，发挥集体力量，搞好年节娱乐。目前正值解放战争空前胜利，我区土地改革彻底完成，春节祝捷劳军，必有一番盛况，希望你们能抓紧报导，并将各种宣传作品，寄给我们选择发表。
