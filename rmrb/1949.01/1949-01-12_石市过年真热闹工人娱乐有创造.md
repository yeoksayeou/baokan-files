　　Shijiazhuang is lively during the New Year, Workers' entertainment is creative
    [Report from this newspaper] The workers of state-owned enterprises in Shijiazhuang celebrated their second New Year after liberation amidst an intense production increase campaign. On December 31st, each factory held a get-together attended by all employees and their families, with 31 programs performed by the workers themselves. On New Year's Day afternoon, Yangko teams performed in the streets, with more than 600 male and female workers participating. The New Year's entertainment activities of the workers showed several distinct characteristics: First, works reflecting the lives of workers began to appear. For example, "I Also Challenge You" from the Guangming Factory, tells the story of an old worker who initially did not approve of launching a production competition, thinking "It's enough for us to work hard, why compete?" Later, in the actual actions of the mass competition, he was moved and eventually participated. "Competing for the Red Flag" from the Fanrong Factory, is about how female textile workers transform backward elements in the "sectioning" competition. "Oppose the Three Hands" is about how awakened workers inspect and supervise individual workers who do not implement labor discipline. The Telephone Bureau's "Model Worker" is a six-act "living newspaper" play reflecting the heroic deeds of the bureau's preparation for war and resumption of work to make up for losses competition. These plays were collectively provided by workers and written with the help of local artists. This has opened up a new path for future development of worker's art and culture. Second, the cultural and recreational work of employees has truly formed a mass activity. Dozens of female workers from Fanrong Factory and Xinhua Weaving Factory participated in the Yangko team. During this joyful New Year, workers in each factory who have any skills have all brought them out. Shadow plays, solos, two-person comic shows, crosstalk, and lotus flower ballads are all available, and most can self-compile new content to promote current affairs and praise production models. In terms of publicity forms, collective dances and short street plays are combined, and the costumes are uniformly changed to simple and healthy costumes and props that reflect real life. Abandoning the form of feudal toxins has taken the entire mass cultural and recreational activities a big step forward. Third, the factory and the workers' union attach importance to the demands of the workers and the masses, and have strongly supported the cultural and recreational work of the workers. Because after the cultural and recreational work was launched, the morale of the workers was high, fatigue was easily recovered, and they were more closely united with each other, which greatly helped the entire production promotion. At first, some people did not believe in the works of the workers themselves. The Fanrong Factory originally planned to give workers a box office treat for the New Year's Eve (requiring 1 million Jicha), but later changed it to a get-together performed by the workers themselves, without any expenses, but the effect was exceptionally good. In particular, the family members were even happier to see that their own people could perform such good plays.
    Of course, the New Year's cultural and recreational activities of employees cannot completely meet the requirements of the workers. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions recently summarized this work and pointed out that the biggest shortcoming in this activity is that the content of the publicity is not rich enough. Many vivid production competitions in various factories, such as examples of heroic models, have not been well added. Therefore, it is required that the workers of each factory give play to their creative talents and continue to write their own things. The art and literature workers who help in the factories should pay more attention to this work. Secondly, the development of each factory is unbalanced. In some factories, the morale of the masses is very high, and the workers' union has not given specific leadership and organization. Some factories only formally mobilize everyone to twist the Yangko, and do not regard it as a powerful publicity method, resulting in a purely entertainment nature. Fourth, the cultural and recreational activities of individual factories take up too much of the employees' rest time, which affects the employees' sleep time, which may hinder the full production of the next day, which is worthy of attention. Now, each factory is summarizing the New Year's cultural and recreational activities and actively preparing new programs. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions plans to convene the Propaganda and Education Committees of each factory in the near future to conduct a detailed review of the cultural and recreational work and prepare for large-scale employee cultural and recreational activities during the Spring Festival.

　　石市过年真热闹工人娱乐有创造
    【本报讯】石市各公营企业职工在紧张的增产竞赛运动中，欢庆解放后的二度新年。十二月三十一日，各厂都举行了全体职工和家属参加的同乐晚会，由职工自己演出的节目有三十一个。元旦日下午，秧歌队在街头演出，男女职工参加的有六百余人。新年的职工文娱活动，表现了几个显明的特点：第一、反映职工生活的作品开始出现。如光明厂的“我也向你挑战”，写一个老工人开始不赞成展开生产竞赛，认为“咱们好好着干活就算啦，何必要竞赛呢？”后来在群众竞赛的实际行动中，感动了自己，最后也参加了。繁荣厂的“争红旗”，是写纱厂女工在“分车”竞赛中，如何改造落后的分子。“反对三只手”，是写觉悟了的工人如何来检查和监督个别不执行劳动纪律的工人。电话局的“模范工作者”，是个六幕“活报”剧，反映该局备战复工补损竞赛的英雄事迹。这几个剧都是由工人集体供给材料，本市文艺工作者帮助写成的。这给今后开展职工文艺工作开辟了一条崭新的道路。第二、职工的文娱工作已真正形成群众性的活动，繁荣厂和新华织布厂都有几十个女工参加秧歌队。各厂职工只要有一技之长的人，在这新年欢乐时分，都拿出来了。拉洋片、清唱、双簧、相声、莲花落样样俱全，且大都能自编新的内容，宣传时事和歌颂生产模范。在宣传形式上，集体的舞蹈和短小的街头剧结合着，化装上一律改为反映现实生活的朴素健康的服装和道具。扬弃了封建毒素的形态，使整个群众文娱活动向前推进了一大步。第三、厂方与职工会重视职工群众的要求，曾大力扶持了职工文娱工作。因为文娱工作展开后，职工情绪高涨，疲劳容易恢复，互相间更加亲密团结，这样对整个生产推动就有莫大帮助。开始有的人还不相信职工自己的作品。繁荣厂原计划除夕包箱给职工看戏（需款一百万元冀钞），后改为职工自己演出的同乐会，没有开支，效果却异常良好。尤其是家属们看到自己人能演这样好的戏更高兴。
    当然，新年职工文娱活动，还不能完全满足工人要求，市总工会日前总结这一工作，指出这次活动中，最大的缺点是宣传内容不够充实，各厂许多生动的生产竞赛，如英雄模范的例子，还没有很好的加进去。在演出的节目中有不少还是反映农村生活的，因此要求各厂职工发挥创作天才，继续编写自己的东西。在各厂帮助工作的文艺工作同志，更应重视这一工作。其次，各厂发展不平衡，有的厂群众情绪很高，职工会没有加以具体领导和组织。有的厂只是形式的动员大家扭一扭秧歌，没有把它当成一个有力的宣传方式，结果形成单纯的娱乐性质。第四、个别厂文娱活动占职工的休息时间太长，影响职工的睡眠时间，会妨害第二天的全力生产，值得注意。现各厂正总结新年文娱活动，积极准备新的节目，市总工会拟于最近召开各厂宣教委员会，详细检讨文娱工作，并筹组春节的大规模的职工文娱活动。　　　　　（张文芳）
