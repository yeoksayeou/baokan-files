　　Coal Miners Sing of the New Year
　　Worker of the Yangquan No. 4 Mine, Wang Zhanxiang
　　Nineteen forty-nine, a year of national victory.
　　A year of victory, hearts are happy, thinking it over from beginning to end:
　　In the past, we worked for the Japanese devils, earning only two and a half jin a day;
　　Two and a half jin, of sorghum flour, which churned in our stomachs;
　　Churned in our stomachs, but we still had to work, and if we worked slowly, we were whipped.
　　In summer we couldn't eat our fill, in winter we had no clothes to wear, see how pitiful that was.
　　After driving away the Japanese devils, came Yan Xishan, out of the devils' gate, and into the palace of the King of Hell; being scolded and bullied wasn't enough, life was even harder than before—three months without pay, five months without funds, we went to ask him, and he just glared; we could only sigh and return with our heads down.
　　Back home, we looked up and saw: our wives with mournful faces, our children with tears streaming down their faces. No clothes to wear, no rice to eat, and afraid the creditors would come to collect.
　　We workers were skin and bones, while the factory director was as fat as a pig—going to Yangquan, riding in a big car, wearing glasses, wearing a watch, with two mine police running ahead.
　　When it was time to eat, he went to the hotel, eating sea cucumber, fish maw, stir-fried mutton, and rice, spending the money made from exploiting us workers' blood and sweat.
　　In March of '47, the sound of cannons boomed, and the People's Liberation Army liberated Yangquan.
　　Manager Zhang was sent to the No. 4 mine to lead us, wearing coarse cloth clothes, eating millet, carrying a backpack, smoking small leaf tobacco, wholeheartedly serving the people, leading us to dig coal.
　　First, the contracting exploitation system was abolished, teaching us workers to freely organize mutual aid teams, everyone contributing their strength, earning reasonable wages.
　　A trade union was organized, helping us in every way. We were not oppressed and had the right to speak. We worked eight hours, and had time to study.
　　With good cultural studies, we can read the worker's newspaper and write documents. We must intensify our studies, the bright future is before us, we must broaden our horizons, and prepare to take control of national leadership.
　　After the New Year, let us unite and produce on a large scale:
　　Coal face workers, dig more coal, carriers, transport it quickly. Everyone works together to overthrow the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, liberate all of China, and the coal sales will be wide:
　　To Shanghai, to Beiping, Baoding and Tianjin will also be transported;
　　Foreign countries will also buy our coal.
　　At that time, our lives will be greatly improved.
　　Greatly improved, and continue to work hard, digging and transporting coal using machines, producing more coal and saving effort, wouldn't you like that. Fellow workers, work harder, and strive to be glorious models taking the lead.

### 煤矿工人歌唱新年

　　煤矿工人歌唱新年
    阳泉四矿工人  王占祥
    一九四九年，全国胜利年。
    胜利年，心喜欢，前前后后想一番：
    过去咱给鬼子干，一天挣的二斤半；
    二斤半，高粱面，吃到肚里往上翻；
    往上翻，也得干，干得慢了挨皮鞭。
    夏天吃不饱，冬天没衣穿，你看可怜不可怜。
    赶走日本鬼，来了阎锡山，出了鬼门关，又进阎王殿；挨骂受气还不算，生活比前更艰难——三个月不开支，五个月没有款，咱去问问他，说话就瞪眼；只得长叹气，低头往回返。
    回到家里抬头看：媳妇哭丧脸，孩儿泪满面。没衣穿，没米面，还怕债主来要钱。
    咱工人瘦得皮包骨，厂长胖得象肥猪——去阳泉，坐大轿，带眼镜，挂手表，两个矿警头里跑。
    要吃饭，进旅馆，吃的是海参鱼肚爆炒羊肉大米饭，花的是剥削咱工人的血汗钱。
    四七年，三月间，炮声隆隆响，解放军解放了阳泉站。
    派来了张经理，到四矿，领导咱，穿的粗布衣，吃的小米饭，走路背背包，吸的小叶烟，全心全意为人民，领导我们刨大炭。
    首先废除包工剥削制，教咱工人自由结合组织互助班，大家出力气，合理赚工钱。
    组织职工会，处处帮助咱。既不受压迫，又有发言权。工作八小时，学习有时间。
    文化学习的好，能看职工报，还能写文件。咱们学习要加紧，光明前途在眼前，咱们眼光要放远，准备掌握全国领导权。
    过了阳历年，咱们团结起来大生产：
    刨头多刨炭，担头快运搬。大家齐努力，打倒蒋贼阎锡山，解放全中国，煤炭销路宽：
    到上海，去北平，保府天津也要运；
    外国也要买咱煤和炭。
    到那时，咱们的生活大改善。
    大改善，再往前干，刨煤搬运改用机器干，出炭多，省力气，你说喜欢不喜欢。工友们，加油干，争取光荣模范咱占先。
