　　Asian Revolutionary Movement Surges, US-British Reactionaries Conspire to Resist
    US imperialism, dragging its lackeys, the reactionaries of Britain, France, and other countries, is stepping up its conspiracy to organize a counter-revolutionary bloc in Asia. Under the direction of the US government, the farce of the so-called "Asian Conference" convened by Indian Prime Minister Nehru officially opened in New Delhi on the 20th. The so-called "Asian Conference," attended by reactionary representatives from India, Pakistan, Ceylon, the Chinese Kuomintang government, Siam, the Philippines, and various Middle Eastern countries, uses the issue of Dutch aggression against Indonesia as a smokescreen, but its main purpose is to exchange ideas on organizing a "Southeast Asian Group" similar to the "Western European Union," which is anti-communist and anti-people. The US government mouthpiece, the Associated Press, unabashedly admitted on the 5th of this month: "Both here (referring to the United States) and India want to make the establishment of a Southeast Asian group possible." Moreover, Philippine President Quirino, a US puppet, gave the Philippine representative Romulo, who attended the conference, the main task of "organizing Eastern countries into a group" (Associated Press, 15th). At the same time, the United States is also instigating Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries to establish a "Far East Military Group" directly participated in by imperialist countries, in order to prevent the so-called "expansion of communism in the Far East." According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 16th, the policy of concluding a Far East military treaty has been confirmed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent statement in the House of Commons. To achieve this goal, Bevin recently held a series of secret talks with French Foreign Minister Schuman and representatives of British dominions such as India, Australia, and New Zealand stationed in Britain. The Anglo-French communique issued in London on the 14th emphasized that Anglo-French "cooperation will be expanded to the East." According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 16th, the countries preparing to join this reactionary group "may include the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and China (the Kuomintang government)."
    The conspiracy of the reactionaries in the United States, Britain, and other countries is obviously aimed at resisting the upsurge of the national democratic movement in Asia and at salvaging their imperialist policies in the East, which have already suffered shameful failures. The continued upsurge of the Eastern national democratic movement, especially the rapid victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war throughout the country, is so terrible for imperialism! The New York Times, representing the US government, lamented on the 11th: "The Asian colonial era is clearly coming to an end." British reactionaries also exclaimed: "Save Britain's colonies in the Far East from communist conquest." Faced with what the US reactionaries consider the "explosive situation" in the Far East, they have to "find ways to stop the spread of communism in other parts of Asia" (Associated Press, 16th). One of their so-called methods is to rely on further uniting with the reactionary forces in various Asian countries as a prescription to prolong the death of the Asian colonial system.
    The winter offensive launched by the Greek Democratic Army across the country continues to unfold victoriously. In northern Greece, the Democratic Army is continuing its offensive against Salonica, the second largest city in Greece, and its periphery, and has achieved great victories. The Democratic Army once liberated Naousa, the industrial center of western Macedonia, on the 13th, annihilating all 1,300 of the defending enemy. On the Peloponnese Peninsula in southern Greece, the Democratic Army is fighting to completely eliminate the fascist royalist forces on the island. The situation in Greece has entered a new stage. According to the Greek Provisional Democratic Government, "1949 will be a year of decisive and victorious battles" for the Democratic Army. The Greek full-scale civil war broke out in September 1946. In the two years since then, although the Greek royalist fascist army has received more than 10 billion US dollars in aid and large quantities of military supplies from the United States and Britain, and although US and British generals have personally commanded and a large number of officers have directly participated in the war, they still cannot avoid the fate of defeat. Now the Greek liberated areas are expanding more and more. According to a Telepress dispatch on the 12th, citing the recent impressions of US reporter Lowe's visit to Greece, "The rest of the map, except for Athens, Salonica, and certain other cities, has been painted red."
    The ugly "trial" of twelve leaders of the American Communist Party by the American reactionary authorities began on the 17th. The twelve leaders of the American Communist Party were arrested by a federal grand jury last July on charges of "propaganda advocating the overthrow of the government." Later, due to the strong opposition of the people of the world, the American reactionary authorities had to be forced to grant bail, and the so-called "trial" was also forced to be postponed several times. Now, as this "trial" has just begun, the American progressive people have protested en masse. Progressive groups in New York formed picket lines around the courthouse. Five thousand progressive people from all over the country held a "Great March for Freedom" in Washington to oppose this infringement of the democratic rights of the people. The American People's Rights Protection Conference is organizing a series of mass protest meetings throughout the country. Protests and telegrams are flying to New York from all over the country like snowflakes.
    Other more important international events recently are as follows:
    (1) The scale of the anti-Dutch guerrilla war in Indonesia is expanding, and even the US-controlled Mediation Committee admitted in its report to the Security Council on the 14th that "Dutch forces are insufficient to maintain law and order or to prevent the guerrilla actions of the Indonesian army." On the other hand, Dutch Prime Minister Drees arrived in Java on the 5th and is preparing to negotiate with the captured Sukarno and others. These traitors wrote a letter of surrender to the Dutch authorities, shamelessly "expressing their gratitude for the treatment by the Netherlands."
    (2) On the eve of the Japanese House of Representatives election, the election campaign is fiercely unfolding. Although the Japanese Communist Party has suffered various oppressions from the US-Japanese reactionaries, its influence is growing. According to a Japanese Communist Party spokesman, "The peasant masses in northern Japan have become increasingly dissatisfied with the conservative parties since the election campaign began, and many leaders of agricultural associations have joined the Japanese Communist Party." The Mainichi Shimbun editorial on the 8th exclaimed: "Unfortunately, the working class, which extremely distrusts the conservative forces, has almost become superstitious about communism."
    (3) The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions met in Paris on the 17th. At the meeting, the Chairman of the Federation, British Trade Union Congress General Secretary Deakin, and the representatives of the United States and the Netherlands, after their attempts to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions were defeated, angrily left the meeting and declared that they would stop cooperating with the World Federation of Trade Unions.

### 亚洲革命运动高涨美英反动派阴谋抵挡

　　亚洲革命运动高涨美英反动派阴谋抵挡
    美国帝国主义正牵着它的走狗英法等国的反动派，加紧进行其在亚洲筹组反革命集团的阴谋。在美国政府的导演下，一幕由印度总理尼赫鲁召集的所谓“亚洲会议”的丑剧，已于二十日在印度新德里正式演出。有印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、中国国民党政府、暹罗、菲律宾以及中东各国反动代表参加的所谓“亚洲会议”，是以讨论荷兰侵略印尼问题为烟幕，其实主要在于互相交换关于组织类似“西欧联盟”的反共反人民的“东南亚集团”。美国政府的喉舌合众社在本月五日已毫不掩饰地承认：“此间（指美国）及印度均欲使东南亚集团有成立的可能”，而美国傀儡菲律宾总统季里诺，十五日在交给出席这次会议的菲代表罗慕洛的任务中，主要一项便是要“组织东方国家成为集团”（合众社十五日电）。与此同时，美国又策动英法荷等国，建立由帝国主义国家直接参加的“远东军事集团”，以防止所谓“共产党在远东的扩张”。据美联社十六日电透露：缔订远东军事条约的政策，已为英外相贝文最近在下院的声明所确定。为达到这个目的，贝文最近曾与法外长舒曼及印、澳、新西兰等国英国自治领驻英代表举行一连串的密谈。十四日伦敦发表的英法会谈公报强调说：英法“两国间的合作，将扩充到东方。”准备参加这一反动集团的，据美联社十六日电称：“可能包括美、英、加、澳、法、荷、新西兰及中国（国民党政府）。”
    美英等国反动派的这个阴谋活动，显然是为着抵挡亚洲民族民主运动的高潮，为着抢救它们在东方已经遭受可耻失败的帝国主义政策。东方民族民主运动的继续高涨，特别是中国人民革命战争很快要在全国取得胜利，这对于美国等帝国主义是多么可怕呀！代表美国政府的纽约时报，十一日哀鸣着：“亚洲殖民时代显然在结束中”。英国反动派亦惊呼：“自共产主义征服下挽救英国在远东的殖民地”。面对着美国反动派认为的远东“爆炸性局势”，美国反动派不得不“寻找方法以阻止共产主义在亚洲其他地方的蔓延”（美联社十六日电）。它们的所谓方法之一，就是依靠和亚洲各国的反动势力作进一步的结合，来作为延续亚洲殖民地制度死亡的药方。
    希腊民主军在全国发动的冬季攻势，继续胜利展开。在希腊北部，民主军正继续向希腊第二大都市萨罗尼加及其外围进攻，并已获得大捷。民主军于十三日曾一度解放西马其顿工业中心脑萨城，守敌一千三百余全部被歼。在希腊南部的摩里亚半岛上，民主军正在为完全消灭该岛上的法西斯保皇军而战。希腊的战局已经进入了一个新阶段。据希腊临时民主政府宣称：民主军在“一九四九年将是有决定意义的胜利战斗的一年。”希腊全面内战是在一九四六年九月爆发的，在到目前为止的二年多中间，希腊保皇法西斯军虽得到美英两国十余亿美元和大批军火、物资的援助，虽有美英将军们的亲自指挥和大批军官的直接参战，但仍不能避免失败的命运。现在希腊解放区是越来越扩大了。据电通社十二日电引证美记者劳氏的最近访希腊观感说：希腊全国“除了雅典、萨罗尼加和其他某些城市，地图上的其余部分都已染上了红色。”
    美国反动当局对美国共产党十二位领袖丑恶的“审判”，已于十七日开始。美共十二位领袖是于去年七月为联邦大陪审团带上所谓“鼓吹推翻政府的宣传”之罪而被逮捕的。后来因为世界人民的强烈反对，美国反动当局不得不被迫保释，而所谓“审判”亦被迫数度延期。现在，当这个“审判”刚才开始，美国进步人民即已群起抗议。纽约进步团体在法庭周围组成了纠察线。来自全国各地的五千进步人民在华盛顿举行了“自由大进军”，反对这一对人民民主权利的侵犯。美国人权保障大会正着手在全国各地组织一连串的群众抗议大会。抗议书和电报正象雪片般从各地飞往纽约。
    最近国际间其他较重要事件如下：
    （一）印尼反荷游击战争的规模正日益扩大，甚至连美国控制下的调处委员会在它十四日向安理会的报告中，亦承认：“荷军力量不足维持法律与秩序，或阻止印尼军的游击行动。”另一方面，荷兰总理德里斯于五日抵爪哇后，正准备和被俘的苏加诺等谈判。这些卖国贼们曾写了一封投降书给荷兰当局，无耻地“对荷兰的待遇表示感谢。”
    （二）日本众院选举前夕，竞选运动激烈展开，日本共产党虽遭受美日反动派的种种压迫，但它的影响正日益扩大。据日共发言人称：“日本北部的农民大众，自竞选开始以来，已日益对保守政党不满，许多农会领袖已加入日共。”每日新闻报八日社论惊呼：“目前不幸的是，极端不信任保守势力的工人阶级，几乎已迷信共产主义。”
    （三）世界职工联盟执行局，十七日在巴黎开会，会上，工联主席英国职工大会总书记狄金和美荷代表，在他们破坏世界工联的企图遭受失败后，即恼羞成怒地退出会场，并声明停止和世界工联合作。
