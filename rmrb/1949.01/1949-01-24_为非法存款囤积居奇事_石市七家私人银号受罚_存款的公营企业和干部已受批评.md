　　【Shijiazhuang News】The Shijiazhuang branch of the People's Bank of China investigated seven private banks, including Huafeng, for violating regulations on the management of banking businesses, engaging in illegal business activities, or violating government regulations freezing public funds on December 25th and 26th of last year. The city government has approved punishments of fines or warnings. The illegal activities of each bank are detailed below:
    (1) Huafeng Bank: Reported capital of 6.53 million (Jicha, same below). During the inspection, it was discovered that it invested 4 million each in Huaxing Bank and Zhengding Zhenghua Bank, totaling 8 million. These two investments alone exceeded the capital amount, not counting other expenses. This violated Article 5 of the "Provisional Management Regulations for Banking Businesses" promulgated by the city government. The city government decided to impose a fine of 30% of the investment amount. In addition, a deposit of 6.5 million was found in the bank's deposit book. The manager and business director claimed that the funds were a private deposit from the business director's brother (Xingtai Tongjuxiang). However, an investigation revealed that his brother had not visited in December, indicating that it was clearly public funds, and it was withdrawn on the 26th. The bank fabricated facts and deceived the government, violating the freeze order. It was decided to impose a fine of 20% of the deposit amount.
    (2) Yuhua Bank: The registered capital of the Xingtai head office is 30 million, and the reported capital of the Shijiazhuang branch is 15 million. There is no list of shareholders. The branch capital is actually within the amount of the head office capital, which is equivalent to operating in the city without capital. The city government has ordered the bank to complete the procedures in accordance with the "Banking Business Management Regulations." Otherwise, the branch's business license will be revoked.
    (3) Commercial Bank: During the period of high prices in December of last year, it hoarded more than 7,000 jin of wheat, more than 3,000 jin of millet, more than 100 bags of flour, more than 500 jin of white oil, and several tons of coal, violating Article 6 of the "Provisional Management Regulations for Banking Businesses" promulgated by the city government. In addition to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce immediately ordering its sale on the market, the city government also issued a serious warning.
    (4) Zhongcheng Bank: Public funds collected on behalf of the government (because the bank had too few tellers, it entrusted a portion of public funds to the bank for collection) were not promptly turned over in accordance with regulations. For example, on December 25th, more than 10 million was collected on behalf of the government, but the date on the account was noted as the 26th or 27th. By accumulating and transferring funds, the collected funds were used as working capital. This is embezzling state capital to expand its own business and inflate credit. The city government also issued a serious warning.
    (5) Hongyu, Tongxing, and Xinzhong Banks violated the Bureau of Industry and Commerce's freeze order of December 21st on deposits of publicly owned enterprises. Hongyu disbursed 24.05 million, Tongxing 2 million, and Xinzhong 2.6 million. The city government fined Hongyu 20% of the disbursed amount, and Tongxing and Xinzhong 15% each.
    In addition, there are also suspicious points in the accounts. For example, Zhongcheng Bank's account shows that it bought more than 40 bolts of homespun cloth. If it is said to be for personal use, it is impossible to use so much. Yuzhong Bank collected a large amount of war support fees and public grain money on behalf of the Finance Bureau without prior reporting. The temporary loan accounts of the bank showed that food expenses and loans to colleagues amounted to more than 10 million, which is suspected of being used for other purposes. This has been brought to their attention during the inspection.
    After the general inspection, it was found that the cash reserves of each bank were too small. Taking mid-December as an example, the deposit balance of the 17 banks in the city was as high as more than 270 million, and the lowest was more than 45 million, with an average of more than 130 million. However, during the inspection on December 25th, Yuzhong Bank reported a deposit balance of more than 200 million, while the cash reserve was only more than 40 million, which was still one of the banks with more reserves. The others generally had very little. For example, Yimin Bank had a cash reserve of 180,350 yuan that day, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank had only 180,000 yuan. Among them, the Commercial Bank collected more than 13 million in public funds on behalf of the government that day, while the cash reserve was only 1.8 million. At the same time, it had a deposit of 20 million in the interbank account with the branch, which is using public money to pay public interest, and the public still has to pay it a handling fee for collecting money on its behalf.
    During the general inspection, attention was also paid to the situation of publicly owned enterprises, institutions, and cadres depositing funds in private banks. It was found that there were 73 publicly owned enterprises and institutions depositing funds (including those registered by the banks themselves in accordance with the government's order to each bank on December 21st), and 51 cadres and soldiers depositing funds privately. The two items totaled more than 890 million yuan. There were also some disguised names that were related to the above-mentioned institutions and departments after inspection. After the inspection, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce immediately ordered a freeze and instructed the funds to be transferred to the branch of the People's Bank of China on the 26th of last month. After research, the leading organs have now decided to deal with the matter leniently. The above deposits will be returned, and the publicly owned enterprises and cadres who deposited funds will be criticized and warned that if they are found again next time, the deposits will be confiscated.
    The Shijiazhuang branch of the People's Bank of China also conducted a review after this general inspection. They first admitted that the branch's management and leadership of the banks were insufficient. For example, the general inspection on the 25th and 26th of last month was the first time in Shijiazhuang. Secondly, the branch itself must improve its business and thoroughly implement the policy of serving publicly owned enterprises, and provide as much convenience as possible to publicly owned enterprises. In addition, it must also overcome some of the institutional and bureaucratic styles that still exist. Regarding the latter point, the branch is now adding institutions. In addition to the two offices and the business office directly under the branch, there is also a South Street business office to collect various deposits from publicly owned enterprises. In the past, there were 13 private banks that collected deposits on behalf of the government. Now there are only three left. The branch is also preparing to establish four business offices, and in the future, it will also prepare to do both collection and payment businesses.

　　为非法存款囤积居奇事
  　石市七家私人银号受罚
    存款的公营企业和干部已受批评
    【石家庄讯】石市华丰等七私人银号，违反银钱业管理法或经营非法业务或违犯政府冻结公款。经中国人民银行石市分行于去年十二月二十五、二十六两日查出，已呈准市政府分别予以罚金或警告处分。兹将各银号违法事实分述如下：
    （一）华丰银号　呈报资本六百五十三万（冀钞、下同），检查时发现它投资华兴银号和正定正华银号各四百万，两项合计八百万，仅这两项投资就超过资本额，其他开支还不算，这是违犯市政府公布的银钱业暂行管理法第五条之规定，市府决定按它的投资数额处以百分之三十的罚金。另外该号存款簿上查出有一笔存款六百五十万元，该号经理与业务主任同称该款系业务主任某的哥哥（邢台同聚祥）私人存款，经调查结果，他哥哥在十二月就没来过，显然是一笔公款，并且在二十六日支取了。该号捏造事实，欺骗政府违犯冻结令，决定处以该项存款数百分之二十的罚金。
    （二）裕华银号　邢台总号登记资金为三千万元，本市分号呈报资金为一千五百万元，别无股东名册，实际是分号资本在总号资本的数额内，等于无资本在本市开业。市府已限令该号按规定的银钱业管理法补办手续，否则吊销该分号的营业执照。
    （三）商业银号　在去年十二月物价高涨之际，囤积小麦七千余斤，小米三千余斤，面粉一百余袋，白油五百余斤，煤数吨，违犯市府公布的银钱业暂行管理办法第六条，除由工商局当即限令其出售市场外，市府并给予严重警告。
    （四）众城银号　代收公款（银行因出纳人员太少，曾将一部分公款委托银号代收）不按规定手续即时交清，如十二月二十五日代收公款达一千多万；帐面上日期注为二十六或二十七日。辗转积累，将代收款占为活动资金。这是盗用国家资本，扩张自己业务膨胀信用，市府也给予严重警告。
    （五）宏裕、同兴、新中三家银号，违犯工商局十二月二十一日对公营企业存款的冻结令。宏裕动支二千四百零五万，同兴二百万，新中二百六十万。市府按动支款的数额处罚宏裕百分之二十，同兴、新中各百分之十五的罚金。
    此外在帐面上也有可疑之处，象众城银号浮记帐上买了四十多匹土布，若说自用，不可能用这么多；裕众银号代财政局收战勤费，公粮款为数很大，事前没有呈报，该号的暂借款帐上伙食开支和同仁借款等竟达一千多万，有移作他用的嫌疑，在检查的时候，已经提起他们注意。
    经过总检查后发现各家银号的库存太少。以十二月中旬为例，全市十七家银号，存款余额最高的达二亿七千多万，最低的也有四千五百多万，平均一亿三千多万。但在十二月二十五日检查时裕众银号自报存款余额两亿多，而库存只四千多万，这还是库存较多的一家，其他一般都很少，象益民银号当日库存十八万零三百五十元，工商银号只十八万。其中象商业银号当日代收公款一千三百多万，而库存仅一百八十万，同时与分行的同业往来帐上却存款两千万，这是拿公家钱叫公家背利息，公家还得给它代收款的手续费。
    在总检查时同时也注意公营企业、机关和干部在私家银号存款情形，发现公营企业、机关存款的（连十二月二十一日政府通令各银号自行登记的在内）有七十三户，干部、军人私人存款的有五十一人。两项合计共达八亿九千余万元。还有些化名经检查也与上项机关、部门有关的。检查后工商局当即下令冻结，并在上月二十六日指令拨到人民银行分行。领导机关经研究后现决定从宽处置，上项存款一律发还，对存款的公营企业和干部给予批评，并且警告下次再查出来决定没收。
    人民银行石家庄分行，在这次总检查后也进行了检讨。他们首先承认分行对银号的管理和领导都不够。象上月二十五、廿六两日的总检查在石家庄还是第一次。其次，分行本身必须改进业务，彻底执行为公营企业服务的方针，尽可能的给公营企业以方便；另外还得克服现在还存在的一些机关化、官僚主义的作风。关于后一点分行现正增设机构，除了两个办事处和分行直辖的营业室外，另设有南大街营业所，代收公营企业的各项存款，过去代收存款的私家银号有十三家，现在只剩三家。分行还准备设立四个营业所，将来还准备做到代收代付两种业务。
