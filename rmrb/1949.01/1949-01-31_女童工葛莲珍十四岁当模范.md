　　Girl Child Laborer Ge Lianzhen Becomes a Model at Fourteen
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Ge Lianzhen is a fourteen-year-old female worker at the Northern Printing Bureau. Since starting work a month ago, she has been very active in everything she does, getting up early every day and busying herself with work; she doesn't rest even when other comrades have gone to sleep. Other comrades, concerned that she is too young and might overwork herself, which wouldn't be good for her health, advise her to "rest, rest! Don't wear yourself out." But she doesn't stop. She is progressing quickly, able to fold 1,800 large sheets in nine hours, a number that is the highest among the trainees. She cherishes materials very much, picking up every single piece of iron wire and hemp fiber from the ground when sweeping the floor each day. Especially when it comes to tedious work like emptying the stove ashes and making coal briquettes, which some comrades find dirty and are unwilling to do, she automatically carries the ashes out, load after load, before the stove is even full. On Sundays, most of the trainees are still not out of bed, but she gets up early to empty the stove ashes, picking out the pieces of coal from the ashes one by one, saving a lot of coal for the section. In this "increase production to make up for losses" campaign, everyone unanimously selected her as a second-class model worker. (Kang Jinrui, Binding Worker, Northern Printing Bureau)

　　女童工葛莲珍十四岁当模范
    【本报讯】葛莲珍是北方印刷局十四岁的女工。参加工作一个月来，她无论做什么工作，都很积极，每天都起的很早，忙着干工作；晚上别的同志都睡了，她还不休息。别的同志因她年岁太小，恐怕劳动过度，对身体不大好，劝她“休息休息吧！别累坏了。”她仍不停。她进步很快，在九小时内能折大页子一千八百张，这个数字，在学员当中数第一。她很爱惜材料，每天扫地时，将地下的铁丝和麻经都一根一根的拾起来。特别是掏炉灰、合煤球等繁琐工作，有的同志认为脏，不愿做，可是她不等炉里灰堆满，就自动地一趟一趟的掏出去。礼拜日，大部分学员还没有起床，只有她早早起来，将炉灰掏完，把灰里的煤一块一块的捡了出来，为本股节省了很多煤。在这次“增产补损”运动中，大家一致选她当了二等模范。（北方印刷局装订工人康金瑞）
