[Shijiazhuang News] On the evening of the 3rd, the First District Government held another symposium for industrial workers residing in the district. Sixty-four workers from public factories such as the railway, waterworks, telephone, electric light, Qianjin, Guangming, and Fanrong factories attended, along with district and street cadres. Everyone gathered together, happily recounting their feelings, work, and observations over the past year.

District Chief Deng started with opening remarks. He said, "Today's democratic government represents the interests of the people. We hope that worker comrades will supervise the government and provide more suggestions for improving our work." Then, Zhao Wenhao, a worker from Qianjin Factory, was the first to stand up and speak. He said, "Today is my first time connecting with the democratic government of our district. I haven't contacted the government in the past, which was due to a problem in my thinking, and also because of the strict work schedule and limited time. Haha! Once I'm familiar with it, I won't have less contact in the future. I will definitely respond to the government's call, step up production, and use our increased production as a practical action to respond to the government's care for our workers' families." Worker Wang Shanglu examined himself, saying, "The day after the liberation of this city, I was afraid of the Communist Party and secretly slipped away! Later, I heard that Shijiazhuang had developed industry and commerce, and improved the status of workers, so I returned to this city to resume work! When I got to the factory, the superiors cared about me very much. I slowly learned and worked hard in production. Oh! My mind is clear now! The Communist Party is the head of the working class." Fang Buyin, a worker from Fanrong Factory, described his life: "I entered the factory in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and it has been more than twenty years now. This year I am sixty years old. Since the liberation of this city, I have finally found a bright road. Before liberation, I put in a lot of effort but got little pay, and couldn't even eat enough sorghum noodles. Now my life has been greatly improved. Because I am actively involved in production, I have also become the chairman of the trade union. All these benefits are given to me by the Communist Party and the democratic government. I am happy, and I want to live forever in a happy society. I will actively produce to support the front lines." Worker Li Erxiao criticized our leaders, saying, "One night last summer, I don't know which department's comrade came to our yard to check household registrations. Without saying anything, they kicked down the gate, grabbed someone from the neighbor's house and left. Later, I asked the street government, but the street government didn't know about it. In the future, I hope that no matter which department is arresting people, they should contact the government so that the people are not frightened." Railway worker Zhang Huaiyu said, "Public security is a major issue, and we must pay attention to checking for bad people. Take me, a poor worker, for example! Last year, I was careless for a moment and had my bicycle, clothes, blankets, etc. stolen by a thief." Liu Hanyue, a worker from the railway car depot, raised a question: "I work on the railway. A letter came from my village asking me to go home. I didn't go back, and the village said that I earned money outside and added several points to my family. Is this right?" In addition, workers Zhang Manchang and others spoke.

In addition to answering the questions raised by everyone one by one, District Chief Deng also focused on examining the relationship between the government and the workers. District Chief Zheng said, "Some working comrades in our government have problems with bureaucracy. They are not used to interacting with worker comrades, and they have a bad attitude towards worker comrades. For example, a mass in the 14th street lost a car, and the street public security officer had an argument with two workers from the electric light company. Because the public security officer did not handle the matter calmly, it caused dissatisfaction among the workers of the electric light company."

Finally, Qi Jin, the First District Party Committee comrade, called on worker comrades to join the Party. He said, "Over the past year, with the efforts of all our worker comrades, the construction of this city has achieved great results, and many model workers and activists have emerged on the production front. You are supremely glorious, and the Party is opening its doors to you, welcoming advanced workers to join the Party." Comrade Qi's remarks won warm applause from the entire audience. Comrade Qi added, "The Municipal Party Committee has repeatedly called on us to make friends with the broad masses of worker comrades and learn skills from worker comrades, but when we examine ourselves, we have not done enough. In the future, I hope that worker comrades will contact the government more, learn together, and further build the people's Shijiazhuang."

The meeting ended in an atmosphere of joy. (Zou Wei, Duan Chunming, Sun Jiquan)

　　石市一区注意工业生产
  　召开产业工人座谈会
  　工人主张加强政府与工人联系
    【石家庄讯】三日晚一区政府又召开住本区内的产业工人座谈会。到会的铁路、自来水、电话、电灯、前进、光明、繁荣等公营工厂工人六十四名，另有区、街干部参加，大家济济一堂，愉快地叙述着一年来的感想、所作、所见、所闻。
    邓区长先来了一段开场白。他说：“今天的民主政府，是代表人民利益的，希望工人同志们来监督政府，给政府多提改进工作的意见。”接着前进厂工人赵文浩首先站起来讲话，他说：“我今天和咱们区的民主政府刚接头，我以往没和政府联系，是我思想上的毛病所致，另外也因为上班严格，时间少。哈！熟习了，今后，就不会联系少啦；我绝对响应政府号召，加紧生产，以我们增产的实际行动，回答政府对我们工人家属的关怀。”工人王尚禄检讨自己说：“本市解放第二天，我怕共产党，偷偷溜走啦！后来我听说石家庄发展了工商业，提高了工人地位，于是我又回到本市复工啦！到了工厂，上级对我很关心，我慢慢的学习，努力的生产，噢！脑筋清醒啦！共产党是工人阶级的当家人。”繁荣厂工人方步印叙述着自己的一生说：“民国十一年我进厂，到现在二十多年了，今年我六十岁。自本市解放，我才摸到了一条光明大路。解放前自己卖力气大，得工资少，高粱面也吃不饱；如今我的生活是大大改善了。由于我生产积极，还当了工会主任，这一切好处是共产党、民主政府给我的，我痛快，我要永远的在幸福的社会里活下去。我要积极生产，支援前线。”工人李二小批评我们的领导时说：“去年夏天的一个晚上，不知咱们哪一部分的一位同志到我们院里查户口，不说黄黑，把大门一脚踩坏啦，到邻居绑上一个人就走，后来俺问街政府，街政府也不知这回事。以后，我希望不管哪一部门，要是抓人的话，要和政府联系一下，不使老百姓受惊。”铁路工人张怀玉说：“治安工作是个大事，可要好好注意检查坏人。就拿我一个穷工人说吧！去年一时不慎，被小偷偷了我一辆自行车，和衣物毯子等。”铁路车房工人刘汉月提出了个问题：“俺在铁路上当工人，村里来信，让俺回家，俺不回，村里说俺在外边挣了钱，给俺家加了好几个分数，这事情对不对？”另外还有工人张满长等讲了话。
    邓区长除把大家提出的问题一一解答外，更着重检讨了政府与工人的关系。郑区长说：“我们政府的个别工作同志，有官僚主义的毛病，不习惯与工人同志们来往，并且向工人同志们动态度。如十四街一个群众丢了一辆车子，该街公安员即与电灯公司两工人生了一场气。由于公安员处理问题不够冷静，引起了电灯公司工人的不满。”
    最后一区区委齐进同志号召工人同志们入党。他说：“一年来，在我们全体工人同志们的努力下，本市建设，获得了很大成绩，在生产战线上涌现了许多模范与积极分子。你们是无上光荣的，党给你们开着大门，欢迎先进的工人入党。”齐同志这一席话，博得全场热烈掌声，齐同志又说：“市委一再号召我们与广大工人同志们交朋友，向工人同志们学本事，但我们检讨起来，作的还很不够。今后，我希望工人同志们，多多与政府联系，共同学习，进一步建设人民的石家庄。”
    会议在欢乐声中结束。　　　　　　　　（邹伟、段春明、孙吉全）
