[Jizhong Telegram] The sun is setting. The bridge-building laborers on the Daqing River are driving piles from scaffolding ten feet high. They are covered in sweat, singing new, improvised songs. Old Yang, a laborer in his forties, sings a line, and the laborers respond in unison. Old Yang sings: "The sun is setting, light the lamps quickly, ah!" The laborers sing together: "Ai hai ke ya! Comrades, let's work hard to complete the bridge, ah! Ai ya ke ya! We must quickly build this bridge, ah hai ke ya! Chairman Mao has ordered the troops to advance, ah ke ya ke ya! Cars and cannons must pass, ah ya ke ya! If the bridge isn't quickly built, they can't pass, ah ke ya ke ya! The People's Liberation Army wants to take Tianjin, ah ya ke ya! Our place, with its water and land transportation, will prosper greatly, ah ya ke ya! Taking Tianjin isn't the end, ah ya ke ya! We also have to take Beijing, ah ya ke ya! Take Beijing and capture Fu Zuoyi alive, ah ya ai ya! And Wang Fenggang, that bald bastard, ah yo ke ya! The entire North China will be liberated, ah yo ke ya! The army will advance south to take Nanjing, ah yo ke ya! Eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries, ke ya ke ya! And the people will enjoy peace..." The songs encourage the bridge-building laborers, making them forget their fatigue; they work together diligently to quickly build this bridge, which is essential for the passage to Pingjin.

　　架桥民工的歌声
    【冀中电】太阳将落了。大清河上架桥的民工，正在丈多高的云梯上打桩。一个个出着满身大汗。高唱着新的即兴歌曲。四十多岁的民工老杨唱一句，民工们便一齐应声唱起来。老杨唱：“日没西山快点灯呵！”民工们齐唱：“嗳嗨咳呀！”同志们加油把大桥成呵！嗳呀咳呀！咱们要快快的把桥修好哇，嗳嗨咳呀！毛主席下命令发大兵呵，咳呀咳呀！过汽车，过大炮都得用呵，嗳呀咳呀！不快着修桥走不通呵，咳呀咳呀！解放军要打下天津，嗳呀咳呀、咱这里水旱码头多兴隆呵，嗳呀咳呀！打下天津还不算哪，嗳呀咳呀！还要打下那北京城啊，嗳呀咳呀！打下北京活捉傅作义呀，嗳呀嗳呀！还有王凤岗那个秃杂种呀，嗳哟咳呀！全华北人民都解放呵，嗳哟咳呀！大军南下打南京呵，嗳哟咳呀！消灭那国民党反动派，咳呀咳呀！老百姓享太平。………”歌声鼓舞着架桥的民工们，他们忘记了劳累；为火速架起这座通往平津必用的桥梁齐心努力的奋斗着。
