　　Japanese Laboring People Increasingly Dissatisfied with Conservatives
　　Actively Support JCP Candidacy
    Many Farmers' Association Leaders and Social Celebrities Join JCP
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th】Tokyo dispatch: On the eve of the January 23rd House of Representatives election, although the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) is being oppressed and devastated by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, its prestige among the Japanese laboring people is still rapidly growing. According to a 12th dispatch from Agence France-Presse, quoting a JCP spokesperson: "Since the start of the election campaign, the broad masses of farmers in northern Japan have become increasingly dissatisfied with the conservative parties. Many leaders of farmers' associations have joined the JCP, and the JCP will gain the votes of small and medium farmers." Among urban workers, the JCP's influence is even more profound. The Mainichi Shimbun, in its 8th editorial, exclaimed in alarm: "Unfortunately, the majority of the working class, who extremely distrust the conservative forces, are now almost blindly believing in communism." The reactionary Yoshida government, in order to stop the trend of Japanese voters enthusiastically supporting the JCP, has openly adopted illegal oppressive measures. The National Rural Police of Japan have been ordered to strictly "monitor" all JCP printed materials. The Tokyo Police Department illegally decided on the 12th to arrest the publisher and vendors of the JCP's Akahata newspaper. Their excuse is that the Akahata's recent special issue, which published the names and photos of 170 JCP candidates, violated the so-called "new election ordinance" that prohibits "agitation and propaganda during the election period." The Osaka Police Department has unreasonably arrested people selling and posting the special issue of the newspaper and confiscated the remaining newspapers. According to TASS, quoting JCP Election Committee Chairman Shigeo Kamiyama, who told reporters that he had obtained permission from the National Election Commission in advance to publish the special issue of the Akahata newspaper listing the JCP candidates. The actions of the Japanese police are clearly deliberate interference to prevent the Communist Party from participating in the election.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th】TASS Tokyo, 13th: Former members of the Japanese Socialist Party and non-party members, including prominent representatives of intellectual circles, continue to join the Communist Party on a large scale. The Akahata newspaper stated that in the past two days, the following well-known figures in society have joined the Communist Party: Tsuruoka, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Public Servants' Union; Saito, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Farmers' Association; Kaneko, Secretary-General of the Tokyo Teachers' Union; Abe, Member of the Saitama Prefecture School Management Committee; Abe, Member of the Akita Prefecture Branch of the Socialist Party; the famous female movie star Tatsuzawa; the writer Fujimori; and the artist Sato.

　　日本劳动人民日益不满保守派
  　积极拥护日共竞选
    许多农会领袖社会名流加入日共
    【新华社陕北十六日电】东京消息：在一月二十三日众院选举的前夕，日本共产党虽受到美日反动派的压迫和摧残，但它在日本劳动人民中的威望，仍在迅速增长中。据法新社十二日电引日共发言人称：“日本北部的农民大众，自竞选开始以来，已日益对保守政党不满。许多农会领袖已加入日共，日共将获得中小农民的选票。”在城市工人中，日共的影响更为深巨。每日新闻报在其八日社论中惊呼道：“目前不幸的是，极端不信任保守势力的多数工人阶级，几乎已迷信共产主义。”反动的吉田政府，为了阻止日本选民热烈拥护日共的趋势，公然采取违法的压迫措施。日全国乡村警察已奉命严格“监视”共产党的一切印刷品。东京警察局已于十二日非法决定逮捕日共赤旗报的发行人与报贩。其借口是赤旗报最近登载日共一百七十名候选人姓名与照片的专刊，是违背所谓“竞选期间不许鼓动宣传”的“新选举条例”。大坂警察局已无理逮捕了出卖与张贴该报专刊的人们，并没收了剩下的报纸。据塔斯社引日共选举委员会主席神山茂夫告记者称：赤旗报之出版日共候选人名单专刊，他事先已获得全国选举委员会的许可。日警这种行动，显系故意干涉，以阻止共产党参加选举。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社东京十三日讯：日本前社会党党员及无党派人士，包括知识界著名代表在内，仍继续大规模地参加共产党。赤旗报称：过去两日内，已参加共产党的社会著名人物有下述诸人：公务员工会全国委员会干事长鹤冈，农会全国委员会干事长斋藤，东京教员联合会干事长金子，崎玉县学校管理委员会委员阿部，社会党秋田县支部委员阿部，著名的女电影名星龙泽，作家藤森，艺术家佐藤。
