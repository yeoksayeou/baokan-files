[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Administrative Office convened a farm conference last month to prepare for agricultural production in 1949. Representatives from fourteen extension farms and four experimental farms attended. The conference summarized this year's farm work and formulated a work plan for next year. Over the past year, the farms have implemented the principle of "extension as the main focus," opened up the farm's circle, and made technology serve the farmers. This year, most of the farm personnel spent most of their time in the countryside carrying out extension work, which has yielded considerable results. According to statistics from thirteen farms, 38,105 jin of improved varieties of millet, wheat, and cotton seeds were promoted, 45,023 jin of wheat seeds were disinfected, 3,112 households selected seeds, 214,511 pear and jujube trees were treated for pests, 1,460 mu of crops were treated for pests, 729,055 diseased millet and wheat spikes were removed, 504 head of livestock were bred, 128 head of livestock were treated for disease, and 891,880 trees were planted. This has improved the farmers' and cadres' understanding of the farms, and everyone has gradually come to value this work.

Considerable experience has also been accumulated in organizing the masses to promote technology, and some typical examples have been created, laying the foundation for future work. For example, the Xinji Farm, in conjunction with the administration in Dacheping, Zhao County, mobilized seventeen villages to treat more than 190,000 pear trees for pests, and in the seventh district of Jin County, thirteen villages were mobilized to treat more than 250 mu of spider mites. The Shen County Farm contacted Jia Tongjiang, a hero and model worker from Jia Village, and organized seven groups of twenty-eight households to select and soak seeds; it also contacted Cui Laoquan, an old farmer from Cuijiazhuang, to collect 10,000 jin of millet seeds.

The comrades who went to the countryside have been tempered in their thinking, awareness, and standpoint through long-term contact with the masses, cultivated a hard-working and simple, realistic work style, understood the needs and requirements of the masses, and learned to accept and promote good experiences from the masses. For example, the Xinji Farm, in the prevention and control of cotton aphids, experimented with a simple, inexpensive, and effective tobacco ash water method, which was welcomed by the masses.

However, looking at the overall farm work, there are still many important shortcomings that need to be overcome urgently. For example, some comrades collected the methods and experiences of the masses but did not scientifically sort them out and improve them; some experimental research projects were not what the masses urgently needed at present. In terms of extension work, insufficient consideration was given to the different situations in different regions, and work was arranged in a generalized manner. For example, in the spring, it was generally proposed that each experimental farm should train ten trainees, work on five to ten key villages, and mate one hundred head of livestock; during the wheat harvest, it was generally advocated to select ears in the wheat fields; and during the autumn harvest, without distinguishing the types and severity of diseases, it was generally called for to soak wheat seeds in warm water, resulting in blindness in the work at the lower levels. The various extension tasks were not well integrated, and many tasks were started but not finished, without clear results. Some caused damage to some crops due to blind extension, without considering soil quality and regional conditions.

　　Focus on Experimental Research　Extensively Promote Improved Varieties

Regarding the work plan for next year's farm, the conference decided: (1) The general guideline is: under unified leadership, focus on experimental research and mass reproduction of improved varieties, vigorously conduct extension surveys; strengthen agricultural management and the training of technical personnel, closely link with the masses, combine technology with the masses, universally launch a movement to improve agricultural technology, and increase agricultural production by one inch. (2) In terms of improvement, experimentation, and research: focus on breeding cotton, wheat, and millet, and fertilizer experiments. Experimental projects should focus on what the masses urgently need. In terms of methods, focus on creating new methods, saving time, and timely cultivating improved varieties. In terms of varieties, pay attention to collecting existing varieties from the masses and introducing excellent foreign varieties. In terms of disease and pest research: focus on natural control methods (such as autumn plowing and crop rotation) and research on preventive measures such as the cultivation and introduction of varieties with strong resistance to diseases and pests. In the research on drug control methods, focus on the comparative effectiveness of various simple and easy-to-make local methods and foreign methods; any method that has been proven by experiments to be simple, inexpensive, effective, and has no or few phytotoxic effects is worth promoting. Alkali land research: focus on basic situation surveys, alkalinity analysis, and cultivation experience of alkali-resistant plants. Each farm should carry out the reproduction of improved varieties of cotton, wheat, millet, Chinese yam, and tree seedlings needed locally. Livestock breeding: focus on encouraging the masses to raise breeding livestock privately and pay attention to epidemic prevention. Seed extension: focus on wheat, cotton, millet, and Chinese yam. It is planned that the farms will promote 2,075 mu of cotton seeds, 11,600 jin; 28,840 mu of millet seeds, 58,090 jin; and 305 mu of Chinese yam throughout the year. All experiments, research, reproduction, extension, and surveys should be carried out in a planned and organized manner under unified leadership. (3) The establishment and management of farms have decided to set up a general farm in Baoding, focusing on experimental research, supplemented by variety reproduction and cadre training. A branch farm will be set up in the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts, focusing on reproduction and extension, supplemented by experimentation. Each county will set up an extension farm, focusing on extension and reproduction. The basic issues of farm management are mainly to strengthen the unity of administrative and technical work, the combination of internal and external work, and the unity of all farm personnel, in terms of ideological understanding and consistency in work steps. (4) In terms of work methods: First, the general farm must strengthen technical leadership over the county farms through the branch farms, with the county as the main target of extension for the branch farms. The county farms, in areas with suitable conditions, should establish a certain number of extension stations with sound mass organizations such as cooperatives or mutual aid groups as the target, and gradually develop from point to area. Second, closely combine with administrative forces. The administration must strengthen its leadership over the farms, and the farms must also promptly and proactively put forward opinions to the administration as technical consultants, and the cadres who lead production in the Party, government, military, and people must all learn technology to enrich the content of production leadership. Good seeds, fertilizers, and medicines can be promoted through advancement societies, cooperatives, state-owned stores, and trade companies. Extension work must be well integrated with economic departments in order to promote and reproduce improved varieties on a larger scale, maintain purity, and improve quality and yield. Third, appropriately grasp the farming season and season, and formulate plans for experimentation, reproduction, extension, and investigation according to the season, and implement them in an organized and step-by-step manner; organize temple fairs for publicity, physical exhibitions, agricultural product competitions, and hold old farmer forums to strengthen publicity and education. Fourth, for an extension task, it is necessary to be responsible from beginning to end and produce certain results. Do not promote what does not meet the needs of the masses, do not promote what is not certain, and compensate for losses caused by promotion. (5) Strengthen business learning and specialize cadres; every farm cadre, especially leading cadres, must learn technology; greatly promote the spirit of mutual learning and discussion of issues, oppose technical complacency, lack of modesty, and conservative ideas. Those who are actively responsible for work and study and have made significant achievements or inventions will be given honorary or material rewards by the government.

　　冀中行署农场会议决定
  　普遍改良农业技术  争取粮食棉花增产
    【冀中电】冀中行署为准备一九四九年的农业生产，特于上月召开农场会议，出席的有十四个推广场和四个试验场。会议除总结了今年农场工作外，并制订了明年的工作方针。一年来，各农场贯彻了“推广为主”的方针，打开了农场的圈子，作到了技术为农民服务。今年农场大部分人员，大部分时间都下乡进行推广工作，并得到不少成绩。据十三个场统计，一年来推广谷、麦、棉花等优良种籽三万八千一百零五斤，麦种消毒四万五千零二十三斤，选种三千一百一十二户，治梨、枣树虫子二十一万四千五百十一棵，治庄稼虫一千四百六十多亩，拔谷、麦病穗七十二万九千零五十五穗，繁殖牲口五百零四头，治牲口病一百二十八头，植树八十九万一千八百八十万棵。提高了农民和干部对农场的认识，使大家逐渐重视了这一工作。
    在组织群众推广技术方面，亦积累了相当丰富的经验，创造了一些典型事例，给今后工作打下了基础。如辛集农场结合行政在赵县大车平发动了十七个村治梨虫十九万多棵，在晋县七区发动了十三个村治火蛛子二百五十多亩。深县农场联系贾村英雄模范贾同江，组织起七组二十八户作到了选种浸种；又联系崔家庄老农崔老权采选谷种一万斤。
    下乡工作的同志，由于长期与群众接触，锻炼了思想意识与观点立场，养成了艰苦朴素、实事求是的工作作风，了解了群众需要与要求，学会了接受与发扬群众中好的经验。如辛集农场在棉蚜的防除上，试验出来了简单省钱效力大的烟叶小灰水，得到了群众的欢迎。
    但从整个农场工作看，还存在许多重要缺点，急待克服。如有的同志搜集了群众的办法与经验，却未加以科学的整理与提高；有些试验研究的项目还不是当前群众迫切需要的东西。推广工作上，对各个不同地区的情况考虑不够，只一般化的布置工作：如春天一般的提出每个试验场一律培养十个练习生，搞五个到十个重点村，交配一百头牲口；麦收时普遍提倡小麦田间选穗；秋收时不分别病害种类与为害程度，一般号召小麦温水浸种，结果造成下层工作中的盲目性。各种推广工作之间结合不够，很多工作有始无终，没有得出明确结果。有的因盲目推广，不看土质、地区条件，使部分农作物受到损害。
　　有重点地试验研究　大量推广优良品种
    关于明年农场工作方针，会议决定：（一）总方针是：在统一领导下，有重点的进行试验、研究和大量繁殖优良种籽，大力进行推广调查；并加强农业管理与技术人材的培养，密切联系群众，使技术和群众相结合，普遍展开农业技术的改良运动，把农业生产提高一寸。（二）改良、试验、研究方面：以棉、麦、谷的育种与肥料试验为主。试验项目，着重群众迫切需要的东西。方法上，着重于创造新办法，节省时间，及时培养出优良的种籽来。品种上，注意收集群众现有的品种，和引种外来优良品种。病虫害试验研究方面：着重于自然防除法（如秋耕轮作）和抗病虫害力强的品种育成与引种等预防办法的研究。药品防除方法的研究上，着重各种简单易作的土法和洋法的效力比较试验；凡经试验证明简单省钱、效力大、没有或少有药害的方法，就有推广的价值。碱地研究：着重于基本情况的调查、碱度分析与耐碱性植物栽培经验。各场都要进行棉、麦、谷、山药等优良品种和当地需用树苗的繁殖。牲口繁殖：着重于奖励群众私养种畜，注意防疫工作。种子推广：以麦、棉、谷、山药为主。计划全年各场推广棉籽二千零七十五亩，一万一千六百斤；谷种二万八千八百四十亩，五万八千零九十斤；山药三百零五亩。一切试验、研究、繁殖、推广与调查，都应在统一领导下，有计划有组织的进行。（三）农场的建立和管理，决定在保定设一总场，以试验研究为主，繁殖品种与培养干部为副。八、九、十一分区各设一分场，以繁殖推广为主，试验为副。各县设推广场，以推广、繁殖为主。农场管理的基本问题，主要是加强行政与技术工作的统一，场内外工作的结合与全场人员的团结，在思想认识与工作步调上的一致。（四）工作方法上：第一、总场必须通过分场加强对县场的技术领导，以县为分场推广的主要对象。县场则在有条件的地区，以健全的合作社或互助组等群众组织为对象，设立一定的推广站，由点向面的逐渐发展。第二、和行政力量密切结合起来。行政上必须加强对农场的领导，农场也要及时主动的向行政提出意见，作为行政上的技术顾问，党政军民领导生产的干部都要学习技术以充实生产领导的内容。好的种籽肥料和药品等可以通过推进社、合作社、公营商店和贸易公司推广出去。推广工作要跟经济部门很好的结合起来，才能更大规模的推广与繁殖优良品种，保持纯种提高质量和产量。第三、适当掌握农时和季节，根据季节定出试验、繁殖推广和调查的计划来，有组织有步骤的去执行；组织庙会宣传、实物展览、农产品评赛、召开老农座谈会，加强宣传教育。第四、作一项推广工作，一定要贯彻始终负责到底，搞出一定的结果来。不适合群众需要的不推广，没有确切把握的不推广，因推广而受到损失的要赔偿。（五）加强业务学习，干部专业化；每个农场干部，特别是领导干部，都要学习技术；大大发挥互相学习和讨论问题的精神，反对技术上的骄傲自满，不虚心和保守观念。对工作学习积极负责，有显著成绩或发明创造的，由政府给予名誉或物质奖励。
