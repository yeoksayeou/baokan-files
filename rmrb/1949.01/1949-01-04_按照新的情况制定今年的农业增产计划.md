　　Formulate This Year's Agricultural Production Increase Plan According to the New Situation
　　With the successive liberation of major cities in Northeast and North China, we have already grasped considerable modernized industrial production capabilities. Future agricultural production must be coordinated with this industrial production to increase the production of various raw materials needed by industry. In addition, rural areas must also produce a large amount of grain and other necessities for urban residents, and must increase the production of various important export goods to exchange for various construction materials. During the ten years of intense war, important cities and modern factories were mostly occupied by the enemy. Therefore, our agricultural production gradually became isolated from urban residents and urban industries. Moreover, due to enemy separation and blockade, and difficulties in transportation and regulation, a state of local self-sufficiency was formed. Now the situation has changed, and this state of local self-sufficiency must be appropriately and rapidly changed. Villages and cities must be combined, and agriculture and industry must be combined, otherwise our economic construction cannot move forward.

　　In order to solve the needs of urban people's lives, the first thing is to increase grain production. In the past, all liberated areas were able to be self-sufficient in grain, and had some surpluses. However, due to the enemy's destruction, the number of draught animals and fertilizers has been greatly reduced, and grain production has decreased by about one-fifth compared with before the war. (If there were no land reform and production movements, the reduction would have been even greater.) The grain harvest was better last year, and after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the grain supply in North China is not expected to face serious difficulties. However, in order to prevent natural disasters and take care of the upcoming liberation of large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, we still need to call on the people to increase grain production. Local governments must study practical measures (such as increasing draught animals, improving water conservancy, etc.). Formulate concrete plans, and strive to restore and exceed our pre-war grain production levels in the next three years.

　　The second is to increase cotton production. In the past, the cotton-producing areas of North China liberated areas had a large surplus, and after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing and Taiyuan, North China will have four to five hundred thousand spindles, and our cotton production will not be enough for our own use. The Northeast also has three to four hundred thousand spindles, and needs to import 20,000 to 30,000 tons of cotton per year. If Qingdao, Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and other places are liberated, the cotton supply will be even more difficult. Currently, more than two-thirds of the national cotton-producing areas are under our control. However, in more than ten years of war, cotton production has decreased more significantly than grain production. Therefore, cotton-producing areas, such as Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, Hubei, and Guanzhong in Shaanxi, must immediately plan and organize the people to increase cotton production, appropriately adjust cotton prices, and provide loans to encourage cotton planting, so that cotton production can be rapidly restored and exceed pre-war levels. New cotton-growing areas should continue to be encouraged if they have the conditions to increase production. If the soil and climate are not suitable for cotton planting, it should not be promoted forcibly, and the increase in grain or other crops should be encouraged.

　　The third is to increase the planting of various oil crops, such as soybeans and peanuts. These edible oils are not only necessary for the people of major cities, but also important export goods. In particular, soybeans from the Northeast and peanuts from Shandong, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu have always occupied an important position in international trade. If we control a large amount of soybean oil and peanut oil, it will not be difficult to exchange for various construction materials we need, which will be of great help to the rapid restoration of our industry and transportation. Therefore, in areas where the soil and climate are suitable, the planting of various oil crops should be encouraged immediately, and the oil extraction industry should be developed.

　　In addition, there are several other important crops, such as tobacco leaves produced in the Weifang area of Shandong and the Xuchang area of Henan, as well as other industrial raw materials in other regions. All those necessary for urban industry and foreign trade should also be promoted separately according to the different conditions of each region. In short, party and government organs in various regions must study the new changes in economic conditions after the liberation of major cities to formulate this year's agricultural production plan. And it is necessary to take care of the special conditions of each region, make overall calculations, and make mutual adjustments. Therefore, various regions must report their production plans, which materials are self-sufficient and can supply other regions; and which materials are not self-sufficient and need other regions to supply. In this way, the leading organs can use these materials to make the necessary adjustments.

### 按照新的情况制定今年的农业增产计划

　　按照新的情况
  　制定今年的农业增产计划
    东北华北各大城市陆续解放，我们已经掌握相当多的近代化的工业生产力量，今后的农业生产，必须与这种工业生产相配合，增产工业所必需的各种原料。此外，农村还必须大量生产城市人民所必需的粮食和其他生活资料，并须增产各种重要的出口物资，用以换回各种建设器材。十年来在紧张的战争中，重要城市和近代化的工厂多被敌人占领。因此我们的农业生产，便与城市人民及城市工业逐渐隔离。且因敌人分隔封锁，运输调剂困难，而形成了地方性的自足自给状态。现在情况已经变化，这种地方性的自足自给状态必须适当地迅速地改变，必须使乡村与城市相结合，农业与工业相结合，否则我们的经济建设便不可能前进一步。
    为着解决城市人民生活需要，首先就要增产粮食。过去各解放区粮食均能自给，且有若干盈余。但因敌人的摧残，耕畜肥料大大减少，粮食约比战前减产五分之一。（如无土地改革及生产运动，则将减产更多。）去年粮食收成较好，平津解放以后，华北粮食供给估计尚不致于发生严重困难。但为预防灾荒，及照顾到京沪等大城市的即将解放，我们尚须号召人民增产粮食。各地政府均须研究切实办法（如增殖耕畜，增修水利等）。订出具体计划，努力于今后三年中使我们的粮食生产恢复并超过战前的水准。
    其次是要增产棉花。过去华北解放区的棉花原有大量余剩，平津和太原解放后，华北将有四五十万纱锭，我们所产棉花将要不够自给。东北也有三四十万纱锭，年需输入棉花二万至三万吨。如果青岛、武汉和京沪等地解放，棉花供给将更困难。现在全国产棉区域，已有三分之二以上为我掌握。但在十多年战争中，棉花减产比较粮食更为显著。所以各产棉区，例如河北、山西、山东、苏北、湖北、陕西的关中等地，必须立即计划并组织人民增产棉花，适当地调整棉价，贷款奖励植棉，使棉产迅速恢复并超过战前的水准。新植棉区如有增产条件，仍应继续奖励。如果土质气候不适宜于植棉，则亦不宜勉强提倡，应当奖励增产粮食或其他作物。
    再次是增植各种油料作物，如大豆和花生等。这些食油不但为各大城市人民之所必需，且为重要的出口物资。特别是东北的大豆，和山东河北苏北等地的花生，向在国际贸易中占重要地位。如果我们掌握着大量的豆油和花生油，就不难换回我们所需要的各种建设器材，对我们的工业和交通的迅速恢复将有巨大帮助。所以在土质和气候适宜的地区，应即奖励种植各种油料作物，发展榨油工业。
    此外还有若干重要作物，如山东潍坊地区和河南许昌地区所产烟叶，以及其他地区的其他工业原料，凡为城市工业及对外贸易所必需者，亦应按照各地不同条件，分别提倡。总之各地党政机关必须研究在大城市解放后，经济条件的新的变化，来规定今年的农业生产计划。且须照顾各地区的特殊条件，通盘计算，互相调剂。因此各地必须报告自己的生产计划，那些物资自给有余，可以供给其他地区；那些物质不能自给，需要其他地区供给。这样使领导机关能够根据这些材料，来作必要的调剂和调整。
