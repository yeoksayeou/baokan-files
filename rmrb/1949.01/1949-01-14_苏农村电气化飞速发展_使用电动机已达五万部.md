Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: TASS reports: In the past year, new achievements have been made in the development of rural electrification in the Soviet Union. From January to November 1948, 2,600 newly established steam and hydroelectric power stations began supplying electricity, and 700 agricultural machinery and tractor stations and 6,000 collective farms were provided with electricity. The power generating capacity of rural hydroelectric power stations completed last year is half of the current total power generating capacity of rural hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union. In eleven months, the number of electric lights used in rural areas increased from one million to one million six hundred thousand.

　　In Soviet rural areas, electricity is becoming the main means of assisting labor, increasing the labor productivity of collective farms, and improving the living and cultural standards of collective farmers and rural residents. Last year, the Soviet government paid great attention to the establishment of large-scale rural power stations. In 1949, the construction of rural power stations will be carried out on a larger scale, with another 5,600 rural power stations to be established, most of which will be supplying electricity within this year, and another 11,460 collective farms and 1,380 agricultural machinery and tractor stations will be provided with electricity.

　　Sergei Yang, Deputy Manager of the Rural Electrification Trust of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, stated: The development of agricultural mechanization has a particular impact on the continuous increase in the number of electric motors used by collective farms, agricultural machinery and tractor stations, and state farms. A year ago, there were already tens of thousands of electric motors in agriculture, of which 11,000 were used in the fields (mainly for threshing and drying grain), 2,000 were used in livestock farms (for watering and preparing feed), 5,000 were used in various enterprises of collective farms such as flour mills, sawmills, and various workshops, and 16,000 were used in agricultural machinery and tractor stations. According to preliminary data, nearly 15,000 electric motors have been installed from January to November 1948. This year, the quantity of electric motors supplied to the Rural Electrification Trust by the electric motor manufacturing industry will increase dramatically, being two and a half times that of 1948 and ten times that of 1947.

　　苏农村电气化飞速发展
  　使用电动机已达五万部
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社讯：在过去一年中苏联农村电气化的发展已取得了新的成就。在一九四八年一月至十一月中，有二千六百所新建立的蒸气和水力发电站已开始供电，又有七百个农业机器和拖拉机站及六千个集体农场得到电力供应。去年一年中所建筑完成的农村水电站的发电能力，为苏联农村目前全部水电站发电能力的一半。在十一个月中，农村使用电灯的数目由一百万盏增加到一百六十万盏。
    在苏联农村中，电力正成为辅助劳动和提高集体农场劳动生产率、提高集体农民与农村居民生活与文化水准的主要手段。去年，苏联政府对建立广大农村电力站曾加以很大的注意。一九四九年，农村电力站的建设，将在更加广大的基础上进行，将再建立农村电力站五千六百所，其中大部分并将在今年年内供电，将又有一万一千四百六十个集体农场和一千三百八十个农业机器和拖拉机站得到电力供应。
    苏联农业部农村电气化托辣斯副经理赛尔基·杨宣称：农业机械化的发展，对集体农场、农业机器和拖拉机站及国营农场使用电动机的数目不断增加，有特别的影响。一年以前，农业中已有数万部电动机，其中有一万一千部使用在田地上（主要用于打谷和烘干谷物），二千部使用于牲畜饲养场（用于给水和调制饲料），五千部用于集体农场的各种企业如磨面厂、锯木厂和各种工作间，一万六千部用于农业机器和拖拉机站。据初步材料，在一九四八年的一月至十一月中，已装置了将近一万五千部电动机。今年，电动机制造工业供给农村电气化托辣斯的电动机的数量，将有惊人的增加，将为一九四八年的两倍半，一九四七年的十倍。
