　　Zhangnan Cracks Armed KMT Secret Agent Case
  　Principal Culprit Kang Dongshun and Others Executed
    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] In Zhangnan County, Northern Henan, the government and the people closely combined and strengthened public security work. Recently, an armed secret agent case was cracked in Jaitaibao Village. On the 8th of last month, the county government specially held a public trial meeting of more than 5,000 people in Huilong Town. In front of the broad masses, the eight secret agent criminals had to confess their crimes one by one with evidence. The principal culprits in the case, Kang Dongshun (who had infiltrated our militia as a captain), Li Jun, and Zhao Tongfang, extorted money from the people in our rear area and robbed the people of their property. In July and August alone, they looted several times, extorting several million yuan in wealth, and shot dead the father of the chairman of our Gengpu Village Peasants' Association and two others with black guns, coercing the militia masses in their Yincun Village to support the enemy. Later, after being discovered by the masses of Jaitaibao, they secretly reported to the democratic government, which captured Kang Dongshun at his home in the village on August 27, seizing two pistols. After thorough interrogation, the principal culprits Kang, Li, and Zhao were found to be guilty of heinous crimes, and were sentenced to death with the approval of the higher authorities. The accomplices Zhao Jiugui and others, five in total, were leniently treated and sentenced to imprisonment. The masses were very enthusiastic after the sentences were pronounced at the meeting. Finally, the county magistrate and the county party secretary spoke, pointing out that the cracking and handling of this armed secret agent case was a victory for the people of Zhangnan in their struggle against the enemy, clearly telling all counter-revolutionary elements that the laws of the democratic government are strict; anyone who is determined to continue evil deeds and persists in their errors will be resolutely suppressed. If they turn back early and stop doing evil, the people will give them a lenient way out. It was also emphasized that the successful experience in cracking this armed secret agent case was to strengthen mass public security work and maintain close contact with the government. They called on everyone to organize joint defense and resolutely crack down on armed secret agents and plainclothes activities to protect the lives and property of the people.
