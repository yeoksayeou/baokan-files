Zhangjiakou Market Active, Prices Generally Falling
[Zhangjiakou Telegram] At the beginning of Zhangjiakou's re-liberation, due to the long-term and brutal exploitation by the bandit Fu, merchants and civilians were extremely short of supplies. In addition, transportation had not yet recovered, and materials from various places could not be imported in large quantities, resulting in temporary price fluctuations. After strong leadership from the government, and after the 28th of last month, railway and highway transportation gradually resumed, and the correct industrial and commercial policies were implemented, enabling materials from various places to flow in steadily. According to incomplete statistics for the 12th, the amount of grain imported reached more than 790 shi. The publicly-owned Yumin Fuel Company and the Dazhong Cooperative also sold large quantities of coal, cotton, and cloth at low prices. In the past ten days, prices have generally fallen. The retail prices of major items from the 5th to the 14th of this month are compared as follows: Millet was 8 yuan per jin on the 5th (in RMB), and 4 yuan on the 14th; white flour was 16 yuan per jin on the 5th, and 10 yuan on the 14th; sesame oil was 40 yuan per jin on the 5th, and 32 yuan on the 14th; pork was 48 yuan per jin on the 5th, and 36 yuan on the 14th. Edible salt was 5 yuan per jin on the 5th, and 4 yuan on the 14th. Cotton was 115 yuan per jin on the 5th, and 95 yuan on the 14th; coal was 80 yuan per hundred jin on the 5th, and 20 yuan on the 14th; plain white cloth was 80 yuan per chi on the 5th, and 22 yuan on the 14th.

　　张垣市场活跃物价普遍下落
    【张垣电】张市重获解放之初，因过去受傅匪长期残酷剥削，各商民物资均极缺乏，加以交通尚未恢复，各地物资不能大量输入，以致一时物价波动。经过政府大力领导，在上月二十八日后，铁路公路交通次第恢复，以及执行了正确的工商业政策，使各地物资源源流入。据十二日一天的不完全统计，输入粮食即达七百九十余石。公营裕民燃料公司和大众合作社复低价出售大批煤、棉、布匹，近十天来，物价已普遍下落。今将本月五日至十四日主要物品之零售价格比较如下：小米五日每斤八元（以人民币为单位），十四日四元；白面五日每斤十六元，十四日十元，麻油五日每斤四十元，十四日三十二元；猪肉五日每斤四十八元，十四日三十六元。食盐五日每斤五元，十四日四元。棉花五日每斤一百一十五元，十四日九十五元；煤五日每百斤八十元，十四日二十元；白岔布五日每尺八十元，十四日二十二元。
