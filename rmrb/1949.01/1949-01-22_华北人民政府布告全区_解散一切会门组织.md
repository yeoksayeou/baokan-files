[Report from Our Newspaper] To protect the interests of the people and maintain social order, the North China People's Government has issued a proclamation to the entire region to dissolve all secret society and Taoist organizations and prohibit their disruptive activities. The full text of the proclamation is as follows:

It has been found that secret societies and Taoist organizations are not only feudal and superstitious organizations, but are also often manipulated and used by reactionary elements to carry out various counter-revolutionary activities. In the past War of Resistance Against Japan and in the current War of Liberation, they have played a disruptive role, such as acting as enemy agents, probing military intelligence, spreading rumors, inciting people, and even organizing armed rebellions, disrupting social order, all of which have been uncovered and recorded by public security organs in various places. If they are allowed to exist and develop, they will greatly harm the cause of the revolution and the interests of the people. In order to protect the interests of the people, maintain social order, and save the general members of the masses who have been misled, and to give the leading elements a way to save themselves and start anew, the Government has specially stipulated the following measures for suppression:

1.  From the date of this proclamation, all secret society and Taoist organizations shall be dissolved immediately and shall not engage in any further activities.

2.  All leading members of secret societies and Taoist organizations shall immediately register with the public security organs of the local county and city governments. Those who have colluded with bandits and special agents or have committed criminal acts, if they can repent and start anew, will be given lenient treatment; those who refuse to register and continue their activities will be severely punished once they are found out. Those who have not contacted bandits and special agents and have not committed criminal acts, as long as they register and stop their activities, will be exempted from prosecution.

3.  All general members of the masses who have been coerced or induced to join secret societies and Taoist organizations shall not be prosecuted once they leave the organization and stop their activities. Those who can expose the conspiracies of bandits and special agents and various destructive activities shall be rewarded as appropriate.

The above measures are aimed at protecting the interests of the people, maintaining social order, saving the general members of the masses who have been misled from suffering misfortune, and giving a very small number of leading elements an opportunity to save themselves and start anew. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will understand this spirit and, in accordance with the principle of treating the illness to save the patient, use persuasion and advice to work together to implement it. It is necessary to be careful to prevent destructive elements from creating rumors and taking the opportunity to sabotage. It is also hoped that struggles will not be carried out indiscriminately, so as to avoid creating unnecessary complications and giving the opportunity for traitors and special agents to instigate.

    【本报讯】为保障人民利益，维持社会治安，华北人民政府顷特布告全区，解散一切会门道门组织，禁止其破坏活动。布告原文如下：
    查会门道门不仅为封建迷信组织，且常为反动分子操纵利用，以进行各种反革命活动。在过去抗日战争中及目前解放战争中，都曾发生破坏作用，例如充当敌探、刺探军情、散播谣言、煽惑人心，甚至组织武装暴动，扰乱社会治安，迭经各地公安机关破获有案。若任其存在与发展，则对于革命事业与人民利益必将大有损害。本府为保障人民利益、维护社会治安，并挽救一般误入歧途的会员群众及予首要分子以自救自新之路，特规定取缔办法如左：一、自布告之日起，所有会门道门组织，应即一律解散，不得再有任何活动。二、所有会门道门的首要分子，应即向当地县市政府所属公安机关进行登记。其曾与匪特勾结或有犯罪行为者，如能悔过自新，当予以宽大处理；若抗不登记，继续活动，一经查明，定予严惩。其未与匪特联系，亦未有犯罪行为者，只要履行登记，停止活动，即予免究。三、所有被胁迫或被诱骗而参加会门道门的一般会员群众，一经脱离组织，停止活动，即一律不予追究。其能揭发匪特奸谋及各种破坏活动者，并酌情予以奖励。以上办法，旨在保障人民利益，维护社会治安，挽救一般误入歧途之会员群众免遭祸害，并予极少数首要分子以自救自新之机会。希各界人民，共体此旨，本治病救人方针，用说服劝告方法，群策群力，贯彻实行。务望慎防破坏分子之制造谣言乘机破坏。并希不滥施斗争，以免别生枝节，予奸特以鼓煽之隙。
