(Delayed) Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, December 20th: A certain general on the Huaihai front commented on the victory of annihilating Huang Wei's Corps, saying:

　　Chiang Kai-shek's bandit 12th Corps—Huang Wei's Corps—has finally been resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilated after more than 20 days of fierce fighting. This victory is worth celebrating and cheering by every commander, fighter, and every Chinese person. The annihilation of Huang Wei's Corps not only lies in destroying the well-equipped 120,000 troops of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of main forces and seizing the enemy's personnel, weapons, and equipment for ourselves, not only in the fact that our vast commanders and fighters who have been fighting hard against the enemy for many years have directly taken great revenge on our mortal enemies, but also in taking great revenge for the vast people who have suffered disasters such as killing, raping, and looting by Chiang Kai-shek's beastly 12th Corps. More importantly, it lies in the fact that our People's Liberation Army has cut off a strong pillar for the crumbling reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and that our People's Liberation Army, in the Huaihai Campaign, after annihilating Huang Baitao's Corps, has annihilated such a powerful enemy corps that served as the northern barrier of the Yangtze River, breaking the "rogue gamble" tactics and accelerating the process of the Huaihai Campaign and even the entire operation towards victory. The victory of annihilating Huang Wei's Corps was achieved primarily due to the strategic guidance of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the correct command of the military region leaders, the strong and close assistance and cooperation of friendly neighboring regions and fraternal corps in various aspects, and the active support of the broad masses and local party and government comrades in providing food, transporting ammunition, and transferring the wounded. Of course, it was also due to the resolute, heroic, arduous, and tireless fighting of all commanders and fighters of our combat troops, who were not afraid of sacrifice. The experience of annihilating Huang Wei's Corps tells us that no matter what so-called "main force" of Chiang Kai-shek's army, such as the 12th Corps and its 18th Army, no matter how well-equipped it is and how frantically counter-revolutionary it is, it will still be annihilated under the resolute iron hammer blows of the People's Liberation Army, and it will still have to surrender its weapons and become prisoners. Any idea that the enemy's main force cannot be annihilated has once again been proven completely wrong in fact. The experience of annihilating Huang Wei's Corps also tells us that even if the enemy's equipment is sophisticated, its defense is strong, and its anti-people fascist education is profound, as long as we pay attention to investigation and research and meticulous planning in military and political work, are not careless, grasp the key to the transition between mobile warfare and positional warfare, and carry out political work that is appropriate to the battle situation, such as the Central Committee's instruction to us to "not rely on surprise attacks, but rely on full reconnaissance and tactical preparation, close-range operations and artillery coordination to achieve success," and to "carry out a fierce and effective political offensive against the enemy," and give full play to the high initiative and creativity of all commanders and fighters, and develop military democracy where everyone comes up with ideas, we will certainly be able to create various tactical, technical, and political methods to defeat the enemy. We should summarize and develop these valuable experiences, and learn from each other and apply them to future victorious operations. The experience of annihilating Huang Wei's Corps also tells us that the larger the scale of the war, the greater the need for the highest degree of concentration, unity, and organization of the will and actions of the entire army, and close coordination between various units and services to achieve victory in large-scale war. In fact, the complete realization of every combat mission directly or indirectly contributes to the overall victory of the operation. The spoils of war or casualties in combat are by no means just the spoils or casualties of a certain part, but constitute an inseparable part of the entire operation. Therefore, after the victory in combat, personnel, weapons, ammunition, vehicles, and equipment must be uniformly adjusted to meet the needs of future operations. In this regard, the recent progress of various units in recognizing the subordination of the individual to the whole, giving full play to mutual assistance, and improving discipline is the greatest. This must be further developed in the future. This time, in our annihilation of Huang Wei's Corps, the coordination of infantry, artillery, engineering, and other services in the formation of offensive positions, as well as in air defense, anti-gas, and anti-tank warfare, has brought new benefits to our tactics, and there are also many valuable experiences in political work in these areas. We still need to earnestly collect and organize these as teaching materials in order to develop our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, and take a big step towards regularization to strive for greater and more complete victories.

　　某将军就歼灭黄维兵团的胜利
  　总结大规模作战经验
    全军意志行动必须高度集中协同动作
    【新华社淮海前线十二月二十日电】（迟到）淮海前线某将军评论歼灭黄维兵团的胜利称：
    蒋匪第十二兵团——黄维兵团，经廿几天来的激烈战斗，终于被我们坚决彻底全部干净地歼灭了。这个胜利，值得我们每一个指战员和每个中国人民庆祝欢呼。黄维兵团的被歼，不仅在于摧毁了蒋匪嫡系主力装备精良的十二万之众，夺取了敌人兵员武器装备自己，不仅在于我们长年与敌人辛勤战斗的广大指战员直接的向我们的死敌作了痛快的报仇雪恨，同时也给遭到蒋匪这支野兽队伍十二兵团残杀奸淫抢掠等灾难中的广大人民作了痛快的报仇雪恨，而且主要的在于我们人民解放军给摇摇欲坠的蒋匪反对统治砍掉一个有力的支柱，在于我们人民解放军在淮海会战中于歼灭黄伯韬兵团之后又歼灭了敌人作为江北屏障的这样一个有力兵团，打破了“流氓豪赌”的战法，加速了淮海战役以至整个作战胜利的过程。歼灭黄维兵团的胜利所以取得，首先是由于中央和毛主席的战略指导与军区首长的正确指挥，由于友邻地区及兄弟兵团各方面有力的密切协助配合，还由于广大群众和地方党政同志的积极的支援，供给粮食，运送弹药，转运伤员，当然也还由于我们所有作战部队广大指战员的坚决、英勇、艰苦、不怕疲劳、奋不顾身的作战。歼灭黄维兵团的经验告诉我们：不管蒋匪军任何所谓“主力”，如象十二兵团及其十八军，不管其武器装备如何精良，其反革命性如何疯狂，在人民解放军坚决的铁锤打击之下一样要遭到歼灭，一样要缴枪和当俘虏的。任何认为敌人的主力不能歼灭的思想，又一次在事实上证明是完全错误的。歼灭黄维兵团的经验也告诉我们：即使敌人的装备怎样精良，守备怎样坚强，其反人民的法西斯教育怎样深刻，只要我们在军事政治工作上注意调查研究缜密计划，不粗心大意，把握运动战与阵地战转换的关节和切合战况的政治工作，如中央所指示我们的“不依靠急袭，而依靠充分的侦察与战术准备，近迫作业与炮兵协同去取得成功”，“对敌人进行猛烈的有实效的政治攻势”，并发挥全体指战员高度的积极性创造性，开展大家想办法的军事民主，一定能够创造出致胜敌人的战术上、技术上、政治工作上的各种方法来的。我们应当总结和发挥这些宝贵的经验，并互相学习、运用到今后胜利的作战中去。歼灭黄维兵团的经验还告诉我们：战争的规模愈大，愈需要全军意志和行动的最高限度的集中性、统一性与组织性，密切各部队各兵种协同动作来取得大规模战争的胜利。事实上每一个战斗任务的完全实现，都直接间接有助于整个的作战胜利。作战中的缴获或伤亡，绝不仅是某一部分的缴获或伤亡，而是构成整个作战不可分离的部分。因此在战斗胜利后，兵员武器弹药车辆装备必须统一调整，以求适应今后作战的需要。在这一方面最近各部队认识个体服从整体，发挥互助作用与提高纪律性最有大的进步，以后还须发扬。这次我们歼灭黄维兵团在进攻阵地的编成，步炮工诸兵种的协同动作，以及在防空防毒防战车中，使我们战术获有新的进益，而在这些方面的政治工作也有不少的宝贵经验。这些还要我们切实搜集整理，作为教材，借以发挥优点，克服缺点，使我们向正规化大进一步，争取更大更完满的胜利。
