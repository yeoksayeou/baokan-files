Battlefield First Aid (Continued)
    Qian Xinzhong

    IV. Points to note for injured people with bleeding: (A) Strive to keep them calm and lying flat, do not let them move restlessly, which can easily lead to more bleeding. (B) Quickly send them to a place where surgery can be performed for safe hemostasis. (C) After temporarily stopping the bleeding, be sure to apply splints (use a rifle instead of a splint if there is no splint), and the upper limb can be tied to the body (torso). (D) Be stable when moving them, especially wounded people with broken bones, to prevent further bleeding. (E) After stopping the bleeding, give them some hot salt water and sugar water. If there is a risk of excessive bleeding, give them a blood transfusion as soon as possible to save their lives. (F) Using compressive bandages to stop bleeding is the safest and easiest way to succeed! Be sure to apply tight and steady pressure, and maintain it. After ten minutes of pressure, tighten the bandage. If necessary, add another bandage to the wound and tighten it. Do not use a tourniquet for more than one hour, otherwise it is easy to cause limb necrosis! Try not to use a tourniquet on the upper limbs, because generally, compressive bandages and raising the injured limb can stop the bleeding.

    V. Brief introduction to hemostasis techniques: When a doctor encounters a wounded person with bleeding, the first thing to do is to control the bleeding, and then make various preparations to examine the wound and see which blood vessels have been injured. Then open the wound to find the broken ends of the blood vessels. It must be remembered that the main blood vessels are in the muscle spaces, not in the muscles. When ligating, both ends must be ligated and cut in the middle, otherwise post-bleeding is likely to occur. When ligating an artery, also ligate the accompanying vein. When ligating a vein, do not ligate the uninjured artery. After the blood vessels are ligated, cover them with a large piece of hot saline gauze. Loosen the tourniquet and slowly lift the gauze to stop the bleeding one by one. Unless it is absolutely necessary, do not use the tamponade hemostasis method. If the doctor's technique is not skilled enough, the conditions are limited, and there is not much confidence, but the wounded person is not bleeding too much, you can use the tamponade hemostasis method to quickly send the wounded person to a surgical team with better skills, but do not tie the tourniquet for a long time.

    III. Simple Pain Relief Methods

    I. Bandage Pain Relief: Wrap the wound flat with a bandage and tighten it appropriately to reduce pain by preventing movement. Wounded people are afraid of pain when the bandage is being tied, so if you wrap it loosely, it will hurt even more.

    II. Fixation Pain Relief: Tie the injured limb to a wooden board to stabilize it so it doesn't hurt. Wounded people with fractures will especially feel infinitely happy, as this reduces pain and prevents disability.

    III. Sedation Pain Relief: Keep the injured nerves calm. Rest quietly after bandaging. If the nerves are injured or the bandaging is improper, immediately ask a doctor or health worker to find the cause of the pain. Removing the cause will relieve the pain. Do not be restless or shout, as this will increase the degree of pain.

    IV. Medication Pain Relief: If the pain is unbearable, give the wounded person opium tincture, morphine tablets, or a morphine injection. For an agitated patient, give some sedative medication, such as barbital. For patients with excessive blood loss, in addition to pain relief, other methods must be considered.

    V. Points to note for wounded people in pain: (1) Be stable and gentle when transporting them. (2) Raise the limbs higher to reduce congestion, which can relieve pain. (3) Record injections and medications on the injury ticket to prevent overdose and poisoning. (4) For late-stage wound pain, use warm compresses, as the wound is already inflamed. (5) For nerve burning pain, three methods can be used for treatment: cold wet compresses or cold soaking of the limbs, taking sedatives, and novocaine injection beside the spine. These should be done by a doctor. (6) Pay attention to the relationship between pain and suppuration, and medical personnel should carefully differentiate.

    IV. Brief Introduction to Life-Saving Techniques

    I. Resuscitation of the Wounded: The wounded person may suddenly faint due to the pain and other stimuli of nerve reflexes. Their face is pale, breathing is fast, and the pulse is weak and rapid. At this time, lay the wounded person flat, keep them quiet, lower the head, and raise the limbs, especially the lower limbs, or wrap them with compressive bandages to prevent more blood from staying in the extremities. Bandaging method: wrap upwards from the hands and feet. If the wounded person can drink water, give them some hot soup and quickly send them to a doctor or surgical team.

    II. Major Life-Saving Matters: The wounded are most afraid of cold and frost, not having hot water or soup to drink, careless handling, continued bleeding, and improper application of splints. These things seem very ordinary, but they can cause the wounded person inestimable pain, danger, and death. If a wounded person has not been sacrificed on the front line, the comrades of the rescue team must think of all means to save him and cure him. The above five items must be done to prevent the wounded from being frozen, lay them down well and cover them well, give the wounded enough hot soup (rice soup, noodle soup, chicken soup), and hot water (tea, sugar water). If the abdomen is injured, do not give him these, as it will make things worse. Be careful everywhere when carrying them up and down the stretcher and on the road to avoid jolting and causing pain to the wounded. For wounded people with bleeding, stop the bleeding firmly according to the above hemostasis methods. Apply temporary splints or plaster casts to the wounded with fractures. If these five things are done well, many seriously wounded people can be spared pain and death.

    III. Wounded people with head, abdominal, and chest injuries should be sent to the surgical team quickly. The shorter the time, the greater the hope of healing! These wounded people should be sent to the surgical team as soon as possible after simple resuscitation has improved their condition. Time is an extremely valuable life-saving factor.

    IV. For poisoned people, first try to move them out of the poison area, and then let them lie down quietly. Breathing non-toxic and fresh air is better than anything else. Do not panic, and then give them medication to neutralize the toxins, such as alkaline liquids.

    V. Artificial Respiration: If you encounter a patient whose heart is still beating but is not breathing, use artificial respiration to save them. The simple method is: (A) The patient lies on their left side, with a package under their head, and the upper and lower limbs on the left side are slightly flexed. The operator kneels behind the patient, holds the right arm with both hands, and presses the chest upwards and backwards, so the patient exhales. Lifting the right arm means inhaling. Repeat this back and forth for a longer time to allow the patient to start breathing again. (B) Another method is to have the patient lie prone, and two people cooperate. One person kneels on the outside of the patient's thigh, and the other person kneels at the head. The person below presses the back and ribs, and the person above lifts both arms. Pressing down means exhaling, and lifting up means inhaling. The effect is the same as the above method. (C) In addition, due to chest injuries or rib fractures, and for children, the above two methods cannot be used. The method of blowing air mouth-to-mouth can be used. Although this method is older, it is still effective and simple. It may still be used.

    VI. Several Effective Medicines: Morphine can relieve pain and calm the wounded, which is very helpful, but the dosage should not be too large. Generally, 0.01 to 0.05 is used at a time, and it can only be used again after six hours. It can be used for people with chest and head pain, but it is best not to use it for abdominal injuries before a doctor's diagnosis. Epinephrine and ephedrine can increase blood pressure and are very effective for wounded people who have fainted, are unconscious, and have weak pulses. Blood transfusion is the best way to save lives! It does no harm for a good person to donate 300 to 500 cc of blood. Giving blood to wounded people can save one person's life with the blood of two people. Launch a generous blood donation campaign everywhere. This is the most concrete and sincere expression of class friendship.

    Infusion of physiological saline and glucose solution is currently the only life-saving treatment. Everyone should study hard to improve and mass-produce it with skilled techniques. The cardiotonic injection that everyone liked in the past - camphor oil - has now been proven to be of little use and can even cause harm if used improperly, so use it as little as possible. Caffeine is better than camphor.

　　战场救护法（续完）
    钱信忠
    四、对出血伤员要注意事项：（甲）力求镇静平卧，勿使转动不安，易致更多的出血。（乙）迅速送到能作手术的地方，去作安然的止血。（丙）临时止住了血后，一定要上夹板（无夹板用步枪代替），上肢可捆在身上（躯干上）。（丁）搬动时要稳。特别是骨头折断的伤员，防止再出血。（戊）止完血后，应给他喝些热盐水、糖水，出血太多有危险者，应急速给他输血，挽救其生命。（己）用压迫绷带止血，是最安然，最容易成功的办法！压迫时一定要压紧而稳，要持久，压到十分钟后，再捆紧绷带，必要时伤口上加一条绷带，再捆紧。用止血带不能超过一小时，否则易坏死肢体！上肢尽量不用止血带，因为一般都能用压迫绷带，高举伤肢，即能止住出血。
    五、止血技术浅说：医生遇到出血的伤员，首先要控制不让他再流血，而后作各种准备，诊察伤形，看伤到了什么血管。再敞开伤口找寻血管的断端，必须记住，主要血管在肌肉间隙内，不要在肌肉里去找，结扎时必须要两端皆结扎，中间切断，否则易发生后出血。结扎动脉时，同时要结扎伴行静脉，结扎静脉时，就不要结扎未受伤的动脉，血管结住了，即可盖上块热食盐水大纱布块，松开止血带慢慢的掀开纱布块，逐一止住血，非到不得已，不要用拴塞止血法，假若医生技术不够熟练，条件限制，没有很大的把握，又不使伤员流血过多，可用拴塞止血法，迅速送伤员到技术较好的手术组去，但不许长期缚止血带。
    三、简易止痛法
    一、绷带止痛：伤口用绷带缠平适当的缠紧，不使移动即可减少痛苦，伤员因在捆绷带时畏痛，要松松的捆结果反而痛的更厉害。
    二、固定止痛：把伤肢捆在木板上，使之稳固不动伤就不痛了，尤伪骨折伤员更能得到无限的幸福，即能减少疼痛又免除了残废。
    三、镇静止痛：受伤的神经要保持镇静，包扎后静静的休息，假若因伤了神经，或包扎不适当，就立即找医生或卫生员看看痛的原因，去掉了原因，即可减轻疼痛，切勿燥动、叫唤，反而增加了疼痛的程度。
    四、服药止痛：痛不可忍时应给伤员服阿片酊、吗啡片、打吗啡针，一个烦燥不安的病人，应给他服些安神药，巴比痛酸最好。失血过多的病人，除止痛以外还得另想办法。
    五、疼痛伤员应注意事项：（一）搬运时要稳要轻。（二）四肢放高一些，减少充血，即能减轻痛苦。（三）打了针、吃了药要在伤票上记明，以防过量而中毒。（四）后期伤口痛，就要用温＠包，因伤口已发炎了。（五）神经灼痛，可用三种方法治疗，冷湿包或冷浸肢体，服镇静剂，脊椎傍用奴夫克因注射法，这些都要医生来作。（六）注意疼痛，与化脓之关系，要医务人员好好的鉴别。
    四、救命术浅说
    一、伤员苏生法：受伤当时突然因疼痛等刺激神经反射作用，可使伤员昏倒，脸上苍白，呼吸快，脉膊细小而速，这时应放平伤员，使他安静，头放低，四肢高举，尤其下肢，或缠以压迫绷带，使四肢末稍不停留更多量之血。绷带缠法：由手足部向上缠，伤员能饮水者，给一些热汤，迅速送伤员到有医生或手术组去。
    二、救命之大事：伤员最怕受冷、受冻，没有热水热汤喝，不小心的搬动，继续出血，夹板上的不好，这几种事，看来很平常，而反能使伤员受到不可估价的痛苦、与危险死亡。一个伤员在火线上没有牺牲，救护的同志，就要想一切的办法救活他，治好他，才对上述五项不使伤员受冻，铺好盖好，给伤员足量的热汤（米汤面汤鸡汤），热水（茶水糖水），伤了肚子就不要给他喝了，喝了反而坏事。上下担架搬运路上要处处小心，勿使伤员受震动，受痛苦，出血的伤员按上述止血办法，确实止住血，骨折的伤员，要上好临时夹板。或石膏夹，做好了这五件事。许多重伤员，即可免受痛苦，免于死亡。
    三、打了头部、腹部、胸部的伤员，要很快送到手术组去，时间越短治好的希望越大！这些伤员只要作过简单苏生法已有些好转，即迅速送到手术组去，时间是极宝贵的救命素因。
    四、中毒的人，首先设法搬运出放毒区，而后使他平静的躺下，让呼吸一回无毒而新鲜的空气比什么都好，不要慌慌张张，然后再给他中和毒素的药如碱性液等。
    五、人工呼吸法：遇见一个病人心还在跳动，而不呼吸了，就用人工呼吸法救他，其简单方法：（甲）病人左侧着地，头部枕一包袱左侧上下肢略屈曲，术者跪在患者背后，双手握住右臂，向上后方压胸膛、病人即呼气，抬起右臂即吸气，来回作的持久一点，即可使患者重新开始呼吸。（乙）另一方法，病人俯卧，二人协作，一人跪在病人大腿外侧，一人跪在头边，下边的人压背李肋部，上边的人抬起两臂，压时呼气抬时吸气，效用与上法同。（丙）此外又因胸部伤，或肋骨骨折，小儿不能用上两法，可用嘴对嘴吹起气法，这种方法虽老一些，但作用还大又简单。不妨仍应采用。
    六、几样有效的药品，吗啡能止痛，能镇静，对伤员帮助很大，但不宜用量过大，一般用○·○一至○·○五为一次，隔六小时后才能再用，胸部头部疼痛病人都可用，但腹部伤未经医生诊断前，最好不用。副肾素、麻黄素，可以增加血的压力，对昏倒神志不明，脉细小的伤员用他很见效。输血是救命最好的办法！好人抽出三○○至五○○西西血毫无损失，给了伤员可用二个人的血救活一个人，各处发动慷慨抽血运动，这是阶级友爱最具体、最真诚的表现。
    输生理盐水及葡萄糖液，是目前唯一的救命治疗法，要大家研究精益求精普遍大量的制造有熟练的技术。以前人人喜欢的强心针——樟脑液——现在证明效用不大，用得不得当反而坏事，故尽量少用。可用咖啡因士的年比樟脑好一些。
