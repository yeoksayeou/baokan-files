Taiyue Telecom: In order to realize the plan for a general increase of 10% in agricultural production in the Taiyue area, various places are vigorously accumulating fertilizer, adding livestock, and repairing and manufacturing farm tools during winter production. Since the district party committee convened a joint meeting of prefectural committee secretaries and government party group secretaries last year, and formulated a plan for large-scale production this year, each special commissioner's office, county, and district formulated specific implementation measures in late November last year. Considerable results have been achieved in the past two months. With the help of 1,651,900 yuan (new currency) in loans, farmers in various places have actively purchased livestock, and more than 2,300 heads have been bought back from Lüliang, Northwest China, Henan and other places. Most of the loans issued this time were combined with the masses' own capital, and some even took local products to exchange, so more livestock was bought; in Yicheng's fourth district alone, 300 heads were bought back in two months. In addition, trade companies and state-owned stores also organized the export of local products in exchange for livestock. According to incomplete statistics, trade companies in various places have exchanged for 135 heads, and the Yongchenggong Store in the Second District has also exchanged for 28 heads, solving the difficulty for some farmers who "have nowhere to buy". According to surveys, most of the livestock this time was trafficked from other areas: for example, more than 1,500 heads were trafficked from the Zhoujiakou area of ​​Henan. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, various places have focused on supporting oil workshops to increase oil cake and bean cake to increase fertilizer. Meng County, Anze, Tunliu and other counties have specially issued oil industry loans. The oil workshop in Changcun Village, Tunliu Fengyi, can produce 240 kilograms of cake a day, and plans to produce 31,068 kilograms in four months in winter; five oil workshops in Tangcheng and Hecuan villages in Anze guarantee to produce 10,000 kilograms of oil cake to repay bank loans. In addition, various places have also expanded the scope of fertilizer accumulation from all aspects by using methods such as pressing and smoking manure, composting road manure, collecting manure, matting pens, irrigating thatch, accumulating burned soil, sweeping streets, organizing sheep flocks, and raising pigs to accumulate manure. In Yangcheng's fourth district, 13,000 mu of land already has manure, and in the sixth district, 17 administrative villages have pressed more than 36,600 piles of smoked manure alone. Six-tenths of the spring land in the entire district already has manure. Places where winter fertilizer accumulation has been done well are mostly due to the active leadership and promotion of cadres or labor heroes. For example, Zhang Xiumo, director of the Yangcheng Zhuangtou Farmers Association, led the masses to irrigate 40 thatch pits in a row, and also accumulated more than 10,000 kilograms of manure himself; the mutual aid group led by Liu Baocheng, a labor hero in Donglizhai, Jincheng, has smoked more than 2,000 piles of manure, which is enough to fertilize more than 800 mu of land at 60 loads of manure per mu. In terms of agricultural tool manufacturing, many counties have established agricultural tool manufacturing plants to manufacture major agricultural tools. Manufacturing plants in Fushan, Qinshui, Yicheng, Yangcheng and other counties have begun to ship goods, and sales are still fast. Jiang County has also held a meeting of iron and wood workers, and will soon start manufacturing agricultural tools. Fushan also focuses on supporting cooperatives to carry out manufacturing. For example, the Minyi Iron Furnace Cooperative in the county, with the support of a 10,000 yuan (new currency) loan, can now produce 350 kilograms of finished products per day. It has cast 450 ploughshares, and plans to produce another 5,000 ploughshares and 2,500 sets of harrow teeth before spring ploughing, in order to complete the task of supplementing one-fourth of the county's iron tools. Farmers in Shimen, Wangtou and other villages in Jincheng also automatically repaired agricultural tools: in Wangtou Village, in half a month, they have repaired 59 large and small hoes and more than 80 pieces of spades, shovels, etc., and newly built four seed drills and two harrows, actively preparing for spring ploughing.

　　太岳冬季生产获得成绩
  　增开油坊大量积肥输出土货换回牲口
    【太岳电】太岳区为实现农业普遍增产一成的计划，各地在冬季生产中正大量积肥、增添牲口、修理制造农具。自去年区党委召开地委书记和政府党组书记联席会，制定今年大生产的计划后，各专署、县、区在去年十一月下旬，即分别制定了具体实施办法。两月来已得到相当成绩。在一百六十五万一千九百元（新币）贷款的帮助下，各地农民纷纷购买牲口，从吕梁、西北、河南等地已买回两千三百多头。此次发放的贷款，大部结合了群众自己的资本，有的还带一部分土产货物去交换，所以买进牲口更多；单翼城四区两个月就买回三百头。另外，贸易公司、公营商店也组织输出土产品，换回牲口。据不完全统计，各地贸易公司已换回一百三十五头，二分区永成功商店也换回二十八头，解决了部分农民“无处买”的困难。据调查，这次牲口大部从外区贩回：如从河南周家口一带即贩回一千五百多头。在积肥上，各地都有重点地扶植油坊，增加油饼、豆饼以增加肥料。孟县、安泽、屯留等县专门发放了油业贷款。屯留丰仪常村的油坊，一天能出饼二百四十斤，计划冬季四个月出三万一千零六十八斤；安泽唐城、和川等村五家油坊，保证出万斤油饼来归还银行贷款。另外，各地又用压熏粪、沤道粪、拾粪、垫圈、灌茅、积烧土、扫街道、组织卧羊群、养猪积粪等办法，从各方面扩大积肥范围。阳城四区已有一万三千亩地有了粪，六区十七个行政村，单压熏粪一项，即压了三万六千六百多堆，全区十分之六的春地已有了粪。冬季积肥搞好的地方，多由于干部或劳动英雄的积极带头推动，如阳城庄头农会主任张秀谟，一连领导群众灌了四十个茅坑，自己也积下了一万多斤粪；晋城东李寨劳动英雄刘保成领导的互助组，已熏粪两千多堆，以每亩上粪六十担计，八百多亩地的粪，已准备妥当。在农具制造上，不少县份已设立了农具制造厂，制造主要农具。浮山、沁水、翼城、阳城等县制造厂，已开始出货，销售还快。绛县也开了铁木工人会议，即将开工制造农具。浮山又有重点地扶植合作社进行制造，如县里的民益铁炉合作社，在一万元（新币）贷款的扶植下，现在每天可出成货三百五十斤，已铸出铧子四百五十个，计划春耕前再出铧五千个、耗齿二千五百付，要完成补充全县铁属工具四分之一的任务。晋城石门、望头等村农民，并自动进行修补农具：望头村在半个月里，已修好大小锄五十九张，铣、耜等八十多件，并新打了四张耧、两张耙，积极准备春耕。
