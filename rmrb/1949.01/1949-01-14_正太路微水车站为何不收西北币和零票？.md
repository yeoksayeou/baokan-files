Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor:
　　On the third day of the new year, around 5 PM, when purchasing tickets at the Weisui Train Station on the Zhengtai Railway, a passenger tried to buy a ticket with Northwest Farmer's Currency, but the ticket seller pushed it back, asking the passenger to exchange it. The passenger then offered a 100-yuan note of Hebei currency, but was told that small denominations were not accepted. However, when the passenger gave him a larger denomination, the change was given back in small bills. What is the reason for this? If the Railway Bureau does not want Northwest Farmer's Currency and small denominations, first, it should issue a notice and post it at each station, allowing passengers to prepare in advance. Second, the government should not have small denominations in circulation. Third, if small denominations are not accepted, the ticket price from Weisui to Shijiazhuang should be set at 20,000 yuan (border region currency), and not sold for 18,000 yuan. The ticket price from Weisui to Huolu should be sold for 10,000 yuan (also border region currency), and not sold for 9,500 yuan.

    Now that the Spring Festival is approaching, there should be additional passenger trains or substitute passenger trains between Weisui and Shijiazhuang. All passengers should buy tickets when boarding. It shouldn't be that some are sitting, some are standing, some are sheltered from the wind, and others are so cold they can't even speak.

    The passenger train between Weisui and Shijiazhuang does not turn on the lights when traveling at night, causing great inconvenience for passengers. I fear that unscrupulous people may cause trouble in the train.

### 正太路微水车站为何不收西北币和零票？

　　正太路微水车站为何不收西北币和零票？编辑同志：
  　在新年后的第三天午后五时许，正太路微水车站售票时，乘车客人拿西北农民票去买票，卖票员将此票推出，叫客人换，客人又拿百元一张的冀钞去买，又说不要零钞。可是客人给他整的时，他却找回零星纸票。这是什么原因？如果路局不要西北农民钞票和零星纸票时，第一，就得出通告，张贴各站，让乘客提前准备。第二，政府就不应当有零星纸币。第三，如不要零币，微水至石家庄就该定出票价两万元（边币），不该卖一万八千元，微水至获鹿就该卖一万元（这也是边币），不该卖九千五百元。
    现在春节将到，微水至石家庄间就该增加客车或代用客车，凡客人乘车时，都得买票，不该有的坐着，有的立着，有的不受风吹，有的冻的连话也说不清了。
    微水到石家庄间的客车，夜晚行车时不点灯，与客人行动大有不便，恐有不肖之徒在车中作怪。
