Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, January 12th: The top war criminal, bandit Du Yuming, is one of the chief culprits who served the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries in enslaving and slaughtering the Chinese people. In 1939, he served as the commander of the Kuomintang Fifth Army. In 1943, he served as the commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang Fifth Group Army and the commander of the Kunming Garrison. In 1945, he served as an alternate member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. In the same year, after the Japanese bandits surrendered, he served as the commander of the Kuomintang Northeast Security Headquarters. Under the direct assistance of the American government in transporting troops and supplying military fire, he led the Kuomintang bandit army (including the Kuomintang army's main force equipped and trained by the United States and the Kuomintang local army reorganized from puppet troops and bandits) to launch a large-scale offensive against the Northeast People's Liberation Army. Bandit Du tore up the successive "ceasefire agreements" and successively occupied cities such as Shenyang, Siping, Changchun, Yongji, Chengde, and Andong, as well as nearby villages. After the Northeast People's Liberation Army turned to the offensive in the summer of 1947, bandit Du was dismissed from his post due to military defeat. In September 1948, bandit Du once again served as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang Xuzhou "剿匪 Headquarters" and the director of the Zhengzhou Command Post, commanding the Kuomintang bandit army to fight against the Central Plains and East China People's Liberation Army. In October of the same year, when the Northeast Kuomintang bandit army was in crisis, he was again sent to the Northeast to serve as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang Northeast "剿匪 Headquarters," but before long after his arrival, the Northeast Kuomintang bandit army was completely annihilated, and he fled back to Xuzhou, resuming his original position as the Xuzhou "剿匪 Headquarters." Less than a month after returning to his post, the Kuomintang bandit army on the Xuzhou battlefield suffered another disastrous defeat. He led the three corps of Qiu Qingquan, Li ＠, and Sun Yuanliang, along with other personnel, totaling more than 200,000 people, to flee southwest from Xuzhou, but were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in the northeast of Yongcheng. Bandit Du refused the People's Liberation Army's order to surrender and the warning against releasing poison, continued to resist stubbornly, and released poisonous gas at the People's Liberation Army. On the 7th and 8th of this month, he also directed aircraft to drop poison gas bombs on the People's Liberation Army. War criminal bandit Du Yuming, stained with the blood of the people, was finally completely annihilated and captured on the 10th. Bandit Du Yuming is from Mizhi, Shaanxi, and is currently 48 years old. He is the first of the forty-three top war criminals announced by the Chinese Communist Party to be captured, and the seventh member of the Kuomintang Central Committee to be captured. The other six are Kang Ze, Wang Yaowu, Pang Jingtang, Fan Hanjie, Zheng Dongguo, and Zhou Fucheng.
