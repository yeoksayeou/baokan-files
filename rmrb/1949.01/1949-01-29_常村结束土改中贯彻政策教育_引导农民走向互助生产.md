[Taixing Telegraph] In Changcun, Third District of Lucheng, due to the consistent attention to the implementation of policy education and the improvement of the organization of Party members, cadres, and the masses for production and self-salvation during the conclusion of land reform, the transition to winter production was smooth after the completion of the land reform work. After the work team arrived in the village, it first explained the policy objectives of concluding land reform at the branch meeting, mobilizing everyone to lead this work well. Then, it conducted extensive policy publicity among the masses, and further promoted in-depth discussions based on the ideological situation of cadres and the masses: Is eliminating feudalism simply fighting the rich? Why compensate wrongly struggled middle peasants? Are the superior's policies correct, and why did mistakes occur? Feudalism has been eliminated, and the peasants have land. What is the future direction of development? After repeated publicity and discussion, everyone clearly affirmed the achievements of land reform, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, recognized the causes of errors, and understood that the future direction is to unite and develop production. It also raised the class consciousness and political awareness of Party members, cadres, and the masses. Jin E, the Women's Chairman, said: "Now I know that fighting feudalism is not simply fighting the rich. What I earn through my own labor is mine, and I won't be fought even if I'm rich, and if I'm wrongly fought, I should be compensated." Because everyone clearly understood the purpose and method of concluding land reform, and integrated the concept of developing production into the entire production process, after formulating a plan, rectifying the peasant association, electing and establishing a people's representative assembly, correcting the components, convening meetings of wrongly struggled middle peasants and struggled landlords and rich peasants, affirming and explaining the achievements of land reform, soliciting the opinions of wrongly struggled middle peasants on compensation; explaining to the landlords and rich peasants that the main purpose of future resettlement is to allow them to labor and produce well. And pointed out: Only by laboring and producing well and being of one heart with the masses is there a proper way out in the future. The People's Representative Assembly, based on the village's situation, determined the number of compensations, resettlements, and adjustments, and conducted appropriate compensations, resettlements, and adjustments respectively, and as a result, everyone was very satisfied. In order to further solve and consolidate the masses' thinking on production and prosperity, after the end of the land reform, they also discussed: Why is it necessary to carry out land reform? Is it possible without land reform? From recalling history and comparing before and after land reform, everyone further clarified the necessity of eliminating feudalism, that peasants could not turn over without land reform, and production could not be further developed. Many people said: The old society protected feudalism and oppressed peasants, and a few people enjoyed happiness; the new society protects the working people, and in order for everyone to have a good time, land reform is carried out. Tongyi said: The reason we weren't rich in the past was because feudalism bit off our roots of wealth! At the same time, everyone also recognized the importance of compensation, resettlement, and finally meeting the demands of the poor and hired peasants from the actual movement, and further clarified the Party's policies. Based on this ideology, everyone was called upon to unite, organize, learn from labor hero Li Shunda (first-class labor hero of Taihang, from Xigou Village, Pingshun), and work hard to produce and become prosperous. At this time, it was discovered that many people were not clear about the idea of getting rich through organization, and thought that they only needed to work on their own. The leadership then guided everyone to discuss the benefits of saving labor and increasing production through organization, so that everyone specifically recognized the importance of organization. Finally, everyone was called upon to care about national affairs and work hard to produce and support the front lines, which further encouraged everyone's production enthusiasm and smoothly launched winter production. For example, Zhang Sannv's two brothers didn't want to work hard in previous years, and didn't go even when the mutual aid group called him. Now, he automatically gins cotton and cooks in the cooperative, and he is very energetic. Zhang Junlong pretended to be stupid during the struggle, but now he often runs east and west, selling goods to make money. In order to increase grain production next year, Guo Cangyu, Guo Huanzhang and others get up before dawn to collect manure, and this year they have all broken up the firewood and grass in the fields and threshing grounds into fertilizer, and many people are rushing to send manure to the fields. Young and middle-aged women spin and weave. Elderly women weave straw hats. Now all the villagers are working with peace of mind and actively.

　　常村结束土改中贯彻政策教育
  　引导农民走向互助生产
    【太行电】潞城三区常村在结束土改中，由于自始至终注意贯彻了政策教育，及提高党员、干部和群众的组织起来生产自救，所以于结束土改工作完成后，即顺利的转向了冬季生产。工作组到村后，即首先在支部会上，说明结束土改的政策目的，动员大家好好领导这一工作。接着在群众中进行了广泛的政策宣传，然后并根据干部群众的思想情况，进一步深入的宣传讨论了：消灭封建是不是单纯斗富，为什么要补偿错斗中农；上级的政策对不对，为什么发生了错误？封建消灭了，农民有了土地了，今后的发展方向是什么等问题。经过反复的宣传讨论，使大家明确肯定了土改的成绩，分清了敌我界线，认识了发生错误的原因，及今后的方向是团结发展生产，并使党员、干部、群众的阶级觉悟、政治觉悟提高了一步。妇女主席金娥说：“现在我可知道了斗封建不是单纯斗富，自己劳动下是自己的，富了也不斗，错斗了还要补偿。”由于大家均明确了结束土改的目的与做法，并把发展生产的观点贯穿到整个生产中，经过制定方案，整顿农会，选举成立人代会，订正成份，召开错斗中农会与被斗地富会，肯定说明了土改的成绩，征求错斗中农对补偿的意见；给地富说明今后安置主要是为了让好好劳动生产。并指出：今后只有好好劳动生产与群众一条心，才是正当的出路。人代会根据本村情况，确定了补偿、安置、调剂数目，分别进行了适当的补偿、安置与调剂，结果大家都很满意。为了进一步解决与巩固群众的生产发家思想，于土改结束后又讨论了：为啥要进行土地改革，不进行土改行不行等问题。大家从回忆历史及土改前后的对比中，进一步明确了消灭封建的必要，不进行土地改革农民翻不了身，生产不能进一步发展。许多人都说：旧社会是保护封建压迫农民，少数人享福；新社会是保护劳动人民，为了大家都能过好时光，才进行土地改革。同义说：咱过去不富是让封建把富根咬断啦！同时大家也从实际的运动中，认识了补偿、安置与最后满足贫雇要求的重要，更加明确了党的政策。在这一思想基础上，号召大家团结起来，组织起来，学习劳动英雄李顺达（太行头等劳英，平顺西沟村人），好好劳动生产发家致富。这时发现了不少群众，对组织起来发家的思想还不明确，认为只要自己劳动就行。领导上便又诱导大家讨论过组织起来省工、增产的好处，使大家具体的认识了组织起来的重要性。最后号召大家关心国事，努力生产支援前线，更加鼓舞了大家的生产热情，顺利的开展了冬季生产。如张三女弟兄俩个往年不想多劳动，互助组叫他也不去，现在自动在合作社轧花、做饭，干的挺有劲。张俊龙斗争时装傻，现在也经常跑东到西，贩卖货物赚钱。为了明年增加产粮，郭仓玉、郭焕章等天不明就起来拾粪，今年都把地里场里的柴草，互助变工刨碎烂了肥，很多人都赶着往地里送粪。青壮妇女纺花织布。老年妇女编草帽。现在全村群众都安心积极的劳动着。
