Hold the Enemy!
    A True Record of the New Anbao City West Gate's Resistance Against Fu Bandit's "Ace" 35th Army

　　On December 6th, the Fu bandit's direct line main force, the so-called "ace" 35th Army, was ordered to flee east to Beiping. They hurriedly boarded over a hundred vehicles in Zhangjiakou, loaded with artillery, ammunition, and the wives of the officers, and fled in panic along the road next to the Pingzhang Railway. The enemy fled quickly, but the People's Liberation Army was even faster. A certain unit of the PLA launched a flying assault and captured Xin'anbao east of Xiahuayuan, cutting off the Fu bandit's escape route. At dawn on the 7th, the enemy, who had fled to Xiahuayuan, discovered that Xin'anbao had been occupied by the People's Liberation Army and were terrified. They then concentrated all their forces and launched a fierce attack on the position of the 4th Company of the 2nd Battalion in the West Gate of Xin'anbao. At this time, the commander of a certain regiment of our army issued an order over the phone: "Now the enemy is trying to escape through the 'death gate'. We must hold the enemy and wait for the main force to arrive to completely annihilate the enemy."

　　The attack began. The enemy concentrated at least thirty artillery pieces and fiercely bombarded our position, which was less than two li wide from north to south, attempting to open an escape route. The forward positions of the comrades of the 1st Platoon were destroyed, and mud blocks splashed into the air. The entire position was shrouded in a gray-yellow smoke, and nothing could be seen clearly. Enemy planes also appeared over our position, taking turns bombing and strafing. When the enemy rushed to within 40 meters of our 4th Company's position, the company commander shouted, "One, two!" All the machine guns and rifles opened fire, and then grenades flew out of the position like raindrops. After killing five enemies, the rest turned around and rolled back. The enemy exhausted their efforts and countless ammunition, but after several assaults, they still could not find an escape route. The enemy officers were anxious. During the third attack, the troop strength was increased to two battalions, and the artillery fire was even more fierce. The entire area in front of the 1st Platoon's position was covered with artillery shells. A burst of artillery fire buried Yao Qing, the deputy squad leader of the 2nd Squad, and Xu Qing and Zhang Yuhai. But the heroes immediately stood up from the ash, wiped the dust off their guns, and continued to shoot at the rushing enemy. A shell exploded beside Yao Qing, tearing his pants, and Zhang Yuhai's hat brim was blown off. However, the heroic soldiers of the People's Army only knew how to eliminate the enemy. They wiped the sweat and dust from their faces with their sleeves and still fought tenaciously with the enemy. After the 1st Company repelled three enemy assaults, the 1st Platoon moved to a new reserve position. The enemy was making a desperate struggle, and the fourth attack began immediately. But this time, the enemy's impact was even weaker, and they lay down motionless far away from us. An enemy commander holding a small red flag forced his soldiers to charge from behind a bunker. Chen Suozi, the deputy squad leader of the 3rd Squad, aimed accurately and gave him a shot. The guy fell down, and with a few more shots, the rest of the enemies fled back. After persisting until noon, the entire 2nd Battalion was ordered to withdraw from the protruding position to the second line of defense at the station and continue to resist.

　　At about one o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy occupied the West Gate position and attacked Xin'anbao City. The sound of artillery fire was deafening, and the shells destroyed the crenellations and turrets on the west city wall. But I reorganized the firepower of the corner bunkers at the foot of the city to form a crossfire network and prevent the enemy from advancing. The enemy detoured to the northwest corner of the city. The bunker where Song Decheng, the machine gun shooter of the 1st Platoon of the 9th Company, was located, was hit by a hole, and the collapsed bricks and soil pressed him and the machine gun down. He struggled to dig out of the bricks and soil, and before long, his machine gun was firing again. The platoon leader encouraged everyone, sometimes here, sometimes there: "Fight! Hold the enemy! The main force is coming, the enemy can't escape." A burst of volleys responded to the platoon leader's call, and pushed the enemy who had rushed to the city back to the north side of the automobile road. After this, the enemy only fired artillery and dared not move forward. Our tenacious and decisive team completed the glorious task of holding the 35th Army.

　　On this day, the enemy only advanced eight li from Xibali to Xin'anbao, under the successive resistance of our army. Before dawn on the 8th, our main force arrived and heavily surrounded the enemy. Fu Zuoyi's "ace" fell into the People's Liberation Army's net of heaven and earth. At this time, the destruction of the 35th Army in Xin'anbao was doomed. (Note: The enemy was completely annihilated on December 22nd) (Ri Hong, Sun Liao)

　　扭住敌人！
    新保安城西关阻击傅匪“王牌”三十五军纪实
    十二月六号，傅匪嫡系主力所谓“王牌”的三十五军，奉命东逃北平，慌慌张张从张家口乘着百多辆汽车，满载大炮、弹药和军官们的太太，顺着平张铁路旁的大路，仓惶逃命。敌人逃得很快，但是解放军比他更快，解放军某部以飞行奔袭打下了下花园以东的新保安，横腰斩断了傅匪的逃路。七号拂晓，逃到下花园的敌人，发觉新保安已被解放军占领，恐慌万状。乃倾其全力，向我新保安城西关二营四连的阵地上猛攻。这时我某团团长从电话上下达了命令：“现在敌人正想逃出‘死门关’，我们一定要扭住敌人，等待主力赶到，全部消灭敌人。”
    进攻开始了，敌人集中了至少三十门大炮，狠狠向我南北不到二里宽的阵地上猛轰，企图打开一条逃路。一排同志们的前沿阵地工事被打塌了，泥块飞溅到半空里。整个阵地都被灰黄的烟雾所笼罩，什么也看不清了。敌人的九架飞机也出现在我们阵地上空，轮番投弹扫射。当敌人冲到离我四连阵地只有四十多米时，连长喊了一声“一、二！”所有的机步枪都开了火，跟着手榴弹也象雨点似的飞出阵地，打死五个敌人后，其余的敌人扭头就滚回去了。敌人费尽心血、费了无数弹药，几次冲击之后，依然找不到一条逃命的出路，敌人的军官们急了，第三次进攻的时候，兵力增加到两个营，炮火也更猛烈了，整个一排阵地前都落满了炮弹，一阵炮弹掀起的灰土，把二班副姚青和许青、张玉海几个人都埋起来。但英雄们立即从灰土里挺出来，擦去枪上的尘土，继续向冲过来的敌人射击。一颗炮弹在姚青的身旁爆炸，把他的裤子炸破了，张玉海的帽檐炸飞了，但是，人民军队的英勇战士们，只知道消灭敌人。他们用袖子擦了一下脸上的汗水和尘土，仍顽强地和敌人干。一连打退了敌人的三次冲锋后，一排转移到新的预备阵地上。敌人正作着垂死的挣扎，紧跟着第四次进攻又开始了，可是，这一次敌人的冲击更加稀松，离我们很远的地方就伏下不动了。敌人一个拿小红旗的指挥官，隔着一道碉堡逼着他的士兵冲锋。三班副陈锁子瞄得准准地给了他一枪，那个家伙倒下去了，又是几枪，其余的敌人都夺路逃回去了。一直坚持到中午，整个二营才奉命从凸出的阵地上撤到车站的第二道阵地，继续坚持阻击。
    下午一点钟左右，敌人占领了西关阵地，并向新保安城逃攻。炮声响成一片，炮弹把西城头上的城垛和高堡都打毁了。但我又组织了城脚的角地堡的火力，构成交叉火网，阻止了敌人的前进。敌人向城西北角迂回，九连一排机枪射手宋德成所在的地堡，被打了一个窟窿，塌下的砖土把他和机枪都压住了，他挣扎着扒开砖土钻出来，停不一会，他的机枪又叫开了。排长一会这里，一会那里地鼓励大家：“打啊！顶住敌人！主力就要赶来了，敌人跑不了啦。”一阵排子枪响应了排长的号召，又把冲到城跟前的敌人打回到汽车路北边去。这以后敌人就光打炮，再也不敢向前进了。我们这支顽强果敢的队伍，完成了扭住三十五军的光荣任务。
    这一天，敌人从西八里到新保安，在我军节节阻击下，只前进了八里路，八号天明前，我们的主力赶到了，将敌人重重包围住。傅作义的“王牌”，这样落到了人民解放军的天罗地网之中。这时就注定了三十五军在新保安的覆灭。（按：该敌已于十二月廿二日全部被歼）　（日红、孙廖）
