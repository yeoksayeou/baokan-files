Implement the New Agricultural Tax Regulations

During the Anti-Japanese War, our North China Region implemented a reasonable burden unified progressive tax. This was proposed based on the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with labor contribute labor, contribute more if you have more money, contribute less if you have less money, and don't contribute if you have no money." It played a significant role in weakening feudalism, encouraging agricultural production among farmers, stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for participating in the war, and uniting all strata to ensure wartime supplies. It was widely supported by the masses. After the land reform, the feudal and semi-feudal land system has been abolished, and farmers have obtained largely equal land. If we continue to implement the unified progressive tax now, in order to restore and develop agricultural production and carry out the new democratic economic construction, it will affect and limit the enthusiasm of farmers in production, because the progressive burden will no longer be placed on the old landlords and rich peasants, but will be placed on the hard-working and wealthy farmers. To adapt to this new rural economic situation, the North China People's Government has promulgated the "Provisional Tax Regulations for Abolishing Progressive Agricultural Tax." This tax regulation calculates the proportional burden based on the normal annual yield of the land, with a tax-free threshold. When the land yield is reported and evaluated truthfully, it becomes a fixed-burden tax system. The tax regulation stipulates that each yield of one "shi" of grain is converted into a standard "mu," and after deducting the tax-free threshold, it becomes the "burden mu" for calculating the burden. The method is simple and easy for everyone to understand. This tells farmers that agricultural burdens are taxed based on the normal annual yield of the land, and that those who increase production through more processing, more fertilization, soil improvement, and selection of superior varieties will not be burdened for the increased yield. This tells farmers that whoever is diligent, who increases production, can become rich, and that there is a certain limit to the amount of tax levied. This tells farmers that planting cotton, peanuts, hemp, and other profitable cash crops is calculated the same way as planting ordinary grains, and the burden will not be increased due to high profits. This tells farmers that all lazy people who do not work diligently must bear the same burden according to the assessed yield and cannot exploit loopholes in the tax rate. The tax rate only gives certain considerations to military families, martyrs' families, and widowed and orphaned individuals who lack labor and have difficult lives.

It must be admitted that the burden on farmers is currently not light. In the overall tax revenue, the burden on farmers still accounts for a very large proportion. This is because although the enemy has been defeated, they have not yet been completely eliminated, and we must continue to fight. After the complete liberation of North China, we must also support the national People's Liberation War until the enemy is completely eliminated. Therefore, the burden cannot be reduced for the time being. In addition, due to military victories, many large and medium-sized cities have been liberated. In the future, supplying food to urban residents and the raw materials necessary for restoring industry will bring new tasks to the liberated rural areas. At the same time, rural areas also need cities to supply a large number of industrial products to improve the lives of farmers. We can only vigorously restore and develop agricultural production, and increase production by an inch from the existing foundation, to relatively reduce the burden on farmers and solve the difficulties encountered in the path to victory. The masses of Renzhuang Village in Licheng County, Taihang, have organized themselves to carry out winter production. Those who transport goods by large carts have earned 11,000 "jin" of rice, those who produce saltpeter and spin have earned 4,000 "jin" of rice, and other sideline production has also earned a lot. It is estimated that in one month, each household can earn enough to pay the full year's public grain. The masses have realized from practical experience that to reduce the burden, they must work hard to produce.

At the same time, only by developing production can we guarantee supply. It is wrong to proceed purely from a financial point of view, regardless of the people's ability to bear the burden and without supporting the people's production. Similarly, it is contrary to the long-term interests of the people to purely emphasize the implementation of "benevolent governance" without considering the needs of war and construction, because if Chiang Kai-shek's rule is not overthrown and the Liberation War cannot be completely victorious, this kind of "benevolent governance" is only beneficial to the enemy.

The basic spirit of the new agricultural tax regulations is to develop production and guarantee supply. The abolition of the progressive tax in the new tax regulations, as well as many other specific provisions, are all aimed at encouraging farmers to actively produce, work hard to become wealthy, and enable the rural productive forces liberated by the land reform to be fully developed smoothly. Only in this way can agricultural production be increased by an inch from the existing foundation, so as to more effectively support the national People's Liberation War. We must grasp this spirit of the new agricultural tax regulations. At the same time, when implementing the new tax regulations, we must also do a good job in assessing production. In the past few years, due to the war, our region has not been able to conduct a general survey of land and assess production. In addition, the selfishness of some farmers or cadres has resulted in extreme discrepancies and imbalances in production registration. In some areas, the registered yield is more than 20% lower than the actual yield, while in some areas and plots, the registered yield is higher than the actual yield due to past efforts to squeeze points and squeeze feudal elements. In particular, there is no uniform standard for yield assessment, and the calculation of annual yields is inconsistent, resulting in disproportionately light or heavy burdens. According to the autumn harvest reports from various places, the heavy burdens account for 30-40% of agricultural income, while the light burdens only account for 7-8% to 14-15%. If these unfair and unreasonable phenomena are not resolved, the spirit of the new agricultural tax regulations cannot be implemented. Therefore, on this year's work agenda, we must use a certain amount of effort to do a good job in assessing production.

If we can do a good job in assessing production this year during collection, and combine collection with in-depth publicity of the spirit of the new tax regulations among the masses, carry out organized production education, and launch production movements from all aspects, then it is possible to increase grain production by 800 million to 1 billion "jin" in the entire region this year. This will not only greatly increase the wealth of farmers and relatively reduce the burden on farmers, but also guarantee the supply of food and industrial raw materials to cities, and provide favorable conditions for the restoration of urban industrial production. This is the goal of the common struggle of the party and government leading organs and the entire people of North China.

### 贯彻执行新农业税则

　　贯彻执行新农业税则
    抗日战争时期，我华北区实行了合理负担统一累进税，这是本着有钱出钱，有力出力，钱多多出，钱少少出，无钱不出的方针提出的；这在削弱封建、鼓励农民生产、发挥农民参战积极性，并团结各阶层抗日，以保障抗日供给上，起过很大的作用，受到广大群众的拥护。土地改革后，封建半封建土地制度已经废除，农民得到了大体平均的土地，今后要恢复与发展农业生产，开展新民主主义的经济建设，如再实行统一累进税，就将影响与限制农民生产的积极性，因为累进的负担已不是加在地主旧富农身上，而将加在勤劳致富的农民身上。为适应这种新的农村经济情况，华北人民政府颁布了废除累进的农业税暂行税则；这个税则，是按土地常年应产量计算有免税点的比例负担制；当土地产量自报评议真实的时候，又是固定负担量的纳税制；这个税则规定每产一石谷，折一个标准亩，扣除免税点后，便是计算负担的负担亩，办法简易，人人可懂。这就是告诉农民，农业负担，是按土地常年应产量征税，多加工，多施肥，改良土质，选用优良品种，因而增加产量者，增加的产量是不负担的；这就是告诉农民，谁勤劳，谁增产，谁就能发家致富，征税是有一定数量的限制的；这就是告诉农民，种棉花、种花生、大麻等等利润大的经济作物，也和种植一般谷物一样计算负担，并不因利润大而增加负担；这就是告诉农民，一切偷懒，不劳动怠于耕作的懒汉，也须按评议产量一样负担，不能在税率上钻空子；税率只对劳力缺乏生活困难的军工烈属、鳏寡孤独给予一定的照顾。
    必须承认，目前农民负担是不轻的：在整个税收上，农民负担，还是占极大的比重。这是由于敌人虽然已经溃败，但还未到最后消灭，我们必须继续作战，华北全区解放后，我们还必须支援全国的人民解放战争，直至敌人完全被消灭为止。因此负担一时还不可能减轻。另外，因军事的胜利，许多大中城市获得解放，今后供给城市居民食粮及恢复工业所必须的原料，给解放区农村又带来了新的任务；同时农村亦需要城市供给大量工业品，以改善农民的生活。我们只有大力恢复与发展农业生产，从现有基础上把生产提高一寸，才能使农民负担相对减轻，才能解决胜利途径中所遇到的困难。太行黎城仁庄村群众组织起来进行冬季生产，有大车跑运输的已赚米一万一千斤，硝纺赚到米四千斤，其他副业生产也赚不少，估计一个月工夫即可将每家全年所交的公粮都赚回来。群众已从实际经验中体会到要想减轻负担，必须努力生产。
    同时，也只有发展生产，才能保障供给，单纯从财政观点出发，不顾人民负担能力，不扶植人民生产是错误的，同样，不顾战争与建设需要，单纯地强调施行“仁政”，也是和人民远大的利益相违背的；因为蒋匪统治不打倒，解放战争不能彻底胜利，这种“仁政”只是对敌人有利。
    新农业税则的基本精神，就是发展生产、保证供给。新税则的废除累进以及其他许多具体规定，都是为了鼓励农民积极生产、劳动致富，使因土地改革而解放了的农村生产力能够顺利地获得充分的发展，只有这样，才能从现有基础上将农业生产提高一寸，以利于更有效地支援全国人民解放战争。我们必须掌握新农业税则的这个精神。同时在贯彻执行新税则时，还必须做好评定产量工作。几年来，由于战争关系，我区未能进行普遍的勘查土地，评议产量，再加某些农民或干部的自私本位，在产量登记上有极大的悬殊、不平衡。有些地区登记产量低于应产量百分之二十以上，有些地区和地块，又因为过去挤分数，挤封建，登记产量高于应产量，特别是产量评议没有一个统一的标准，年景计算也不一致，造成了负担上的畸轻畸重。根据各地秋征反映：重的有占农业收入百分之三、四十的，轻的则只占百分之七、八到十四、五。这种不公、不合理现象如不解决，新农业税则精神即无法贯彻。因此，今年工作日程上，我们必须用一定的力量去做好评产工作。
    如果我们今年在征收时能把评产工作做好，并结合征收，在群众中深入宣传新税则的精神，进行组织起来的生产教育，从各方面开展生产运动，那末，今年就有可能在全区增产八亿到十亿斤粮食，这不仅大大增加了农民的财富，相对的减轻了农民负担，而且保证了城市食粮与工业原料的供给，又给恢复城市工业生产提供了有利条件，这是我华北党政领导机关与全体人民共同奋斗的目标。
