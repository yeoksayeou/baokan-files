　　Mass Supervision and Worker Correspondents
    Krupskaya
    The idea that there must be mass supervision, primarily by workers, to supervise production and distribution, banks, factories, etc., and their own country, permeates all the articles and speeches of Lenin concerning how to build a new type of state.

    Bureaucrats stand above the people, and they implement top-down supervision, which is bureaucratic supervision. This is a superficial supervision that is easily evaded. This is exactly the kind of supervision that capitalists want.

    "...to smash at once the old bureaucratic machine and to begin immediately to construct a new one that will enable us gradually to abolish all bureaucracy completely, is not a Utopia; it is the experience of the Commune, it is the direct and imperative task of the revolutionary proletariat." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 21, p. 402)

    "First of all," Lenin wrote, "accounting and control must be organised by the workers' organisations, and then by all the working people." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 22, p. 374)

    Lenin said that if we want to fight bureaucracy, we should absorb the masses from below to participate in this work.

    In his speech at the Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education Workers on October 17, 1921, Lenin said: "A short period of experience has convinced us... that without a period of socialist accounting and control it is impossible even to approach the lower stage of communism." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 27, p. 39)

    We have now forgotten that the original task of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection was to be an organization for the supervision and inspection of state organs by workers and peasants.

    Lenin said in 1920: "The Workers' and Peasants' Inspection does not correspond to its name, we cannot use it, because the advanced workers have all gone to the front, because the cultural level of the peasant masses is not yet high enough to promote personnel on a large scale." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 25, p. 493)

    In the same speech, Lenin said: "What other method is there to eliminate bureaucracy except by involving workers and peasants in supervision? The criticisms made at district meetings are all trivial matters, but I have not heard anything mentioned about the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection. I have not heard of any district involving workers and peasants in this endeavor. Real construction work is the application of criticism and ensuring that its content is correct." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 25, p. 495)

    Lenin repeatedly pondered the issue of worker mass supervision of state organs. His last few articles on the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection and the Central Control Commission clarify this issue.

    Why is our work on mass supervision and the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection still being done so poorly? What is lacking? According to Ilyich, what is lacking is culture. To re-educate the masses. "Our task is to overcome all resistance from the capitalists, not only to overcome military and political resistance, but also to overcome the deepest and most powerful ideological resistance..." "To realize the work of transforming the masses in this respect. What we see is the masses' concern for knowledge, their enthusiasm for communism, which guarantees that we can also become victors here, although perhaps not as quickly as on the front line." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 25, p. 454)

    How to transform the masses, how to re-educate the masses, how to stubbornly and for a long time prepare the masses to realize supervision of production and distribution, as well as of state organs?

    Teach the masses to be good at "observing."

    How can this be done and how to do it?

    Lenin answered this question in his "Letters on Tactics": "To be able to adapt formulas to practical life." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 20, p. 102)

    "Now it is necessary to grasp such an indisputable truth, namely, that Marxists should take into account the living life and the accurate facts of reality..." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 20, p. 101)

    "Theory can at most only point out the main and general things, on the contrary, it is close to grasping complex life." ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 20, p. 102)

    Life is very complicated. It is necessary to be good at explaining it, to arouse the workers to understand the theory and understand communism by explaining the details of the workers' daily life, to make a certain link between communism and the trivial matters and the ever-changing daily life. Only by illuminating these details with the light of proletarian ideology at all times can we teach the worker masses to "observe practical life" and consciously treat practical life, criticize it from the communist point of view, and realize genuine proletarian supervision.

    From all of the above, the great role of worker correspondents can be clearly seen.

    Worker correspondents explain the workers' daily life, which is close and easy to understand for the worker masses, from a communist point of view. This helps the worker masses to better understand communism, teaches the masses to "observe," criticize, and realize supervision.

    In order to realize this major task, worker correspondents should study intently. They should improve and study communist theory as deeply as possible. They should arm themselves with communist glasses—if you can say so—in order to carefully observe the daily life of the workers through these glasses. They should be good at grasping the most important, the most typical, the most representative of everything, and put on a link connected to proletarian ideology.

    The task of worker correspondents, if viewed with the seriousness it deserves, is extremely responsible and difficult, but at the same time it is very important, and it also contains the task of helping to realize Ilyich's ideal of genuine worker supervision.

### 群众监督与工人通讯员

　　群众监督与工人通讯员
    克鲁普斯卡娅
    关于必须要有群众的，首先是工人的监督，要对生产和分配，对银行、工厂等等以及对自己国家实行监督的思想，贯串了列宁论及如何建立新式国家问题的一切文章和演说。
    官僚是站在人民之上的，他们所实行的是自上而下的监督，是官僚主义的监督。这是一种表面上的，很容易回避的监督。资本家所要的，正是这样的监督。
    “……一下子粉碎旧的官僚机器，并立即着手建立能逐渐把一切官僚彻底杜绝的新机器，这并不是乌托邦，这是巴黎公社的经验，这是革命无产阶级之直接的和迫切的任务。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十一卷，第四○二页）
    “首先，——列宁写道，——应由工人组织来实现统计和监督，然后就应由所有全体人民来实现统计和监督。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十二卷，第三七四页）
    列宁说，如果我们想与官僚主义作斗争，就应吸收下层群众来参加这一工作。
    列宁于一九二一年十月十七日在第二次全俄政治文化教育工作人员大会上的演词中说：“一个较短时期的经验就使我们相信……，没有社会主义的统计和监督时期，哪怕是走到共产主义底低级阶段都是不可能的。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十七卷，第三九页）
    我们现在竟忘记了，工农检查院最初的任务，是工农对国家机关实行监督检察的一种组织。
    列宁在一九二○年时说：“工农检查院现在还名不符实，还不能使用它，因为先进的工人都上前线了，因为农民群众的文化水平还不能去大批提拔工作人员。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十五卷，第四九三页）
    列宁在同一讲演中说：“除吸收工农参加监督以外还有什么方法可以消除官僚主义呢？在区会议上所批评的也都是些琐碎事情，关于工农检查院的问题我却完全没有听到说及。我没有听见某个区吸收了工人和农民来参加这一事业。真正的建设工作，这就是运用批评并使其内容正确。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十五卷，第四九五页）
    列宁关于工人群众监督国家机关的问题曾只复地思索过。他最后几篇论工农检查院和中央监察委员会的文章，就是阐明这个问题的。
    为什么我们关于群众监督和工农检查院的工作仍然作得这样坏呢？缺乏什么呢？据依里奇的意见，缺乏文化。要重新教育群众。“我们的任务是战胜资本家的一切反抗，不仅要战胜军事的和政治的反抗，而且还要战胜最深刻和最强有力的思想上的反抗……”“要实现在这方面改造群众的工作。我们所见到的，群众对知识之关心，对共产主义的热忱，担保我们在这里也能成为胜利者，虽然，可能不象在战线上那样的快”。（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十五卷，第四五四页）
    怎样改造群众，怎样从新教育群众，怎样顽强地和长期地准备群众去实现对生产和分配以及对国家机关的监督呢？
    要教群众善于“观察”。
    怎样才能作到这点并怎样去作呢？
    列宁在其“论策略的信”中对这个问题回答说：“要善于将公式去适应实际生活。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十卷，第一○二页）
    “现在必须领会这样一个毫无争论的真理，即马克思主义者应当估计到活的生活和现实底确切事实……”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十卷，第一○一页）
    “理论至多只能指出主要的和一般的东西，反接近于把握复杂的生活。”（“列宁全集”，俄文版，第二十卷，第一○二页）
    生活是很复杂的，要善于去说明他，要借阐明工人日常生活细情小节，引起工人去了解理论，去了解共产主义，要使包括有繁琐事情和变换无常的日常生活与共产主义间有某种引带存在。只有时时刻刻都以无产阶级思想底光芒去照耀这些细情小事，才能教工人群众去“观察实际生活”和自觉地对待实际生活，从共产主义的观点上来批评它和实现真正的无产阶级监督。
    从上述一切就可以明显地看到工人通讯员的巨大作用了。
    工人通讯员从共产主义观点上来阐明工人群众亲切易解的日常生活，这就帮助工人群众更好地来了解共产主义，教群众去“观察”，批评和实现监督。
    为要实现这个重大的任务，工人通讯员就应潜心地来学习。他应尽量完善和尽可能深刻地来研究共产主义理论，他应以共产主义眼镜，——如果可以这样说，——来武装自己，以便经过这副眼镜仔细地去观察工人的日常生活。他应善于把握最主要、最标本、最足以代表一切的东西，并套上联系于无产阶级思想的引带。
    工人通讯员底任务，如果按其应有的严重程度说来，是极负责，极困难，但同时又是非常重要的，其中还包含有帮助使依里奇关于真正工人监督的理想实现的任务。
    此文写于一九二四年二月。
