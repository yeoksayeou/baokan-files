[Pingzhang Frontline Dispatch] In the battle to encircle and annihilate the bandit Fu troops at Xinbaoan, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Pingzhang Frontline heroically and stubbornly resisted the enemy, successfully thwarting the bandit Fu's 104th Army's attempt to join forces with the 35th Army and break out of the encirclement. The two divisions of the bandit Fu's 35th Army, which had fled east from Zhangjiakou, were tightly surrounded by the People's Liberation Army at Xinbaoan. Fu Zuoyi, distressed at the imminent annihilation of his "ace" army, hastily ordered the 250th and 269th Divisions of his 104th Army to set out from Huailai on the 9th, advancing westward along the Yongding River at full speed, to attack the flanks and rear of our Dongbalipu frontline positions in the Qiaojiaying and Xiantan area, ten miles from Xinbaoan. The enemy's 101st Division of the 35th Army, surrounded by us in Xinbaoan, simultaneously launched a fierce attack on our frontline positions in conjunction with aircraft and artillery, attempting to join forces with their 104th Army and break out of the encirclement. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit, firmly holding their positions, calmly resisted under the enemy's heavy artillery fire and aerial bombing. When the enemy advanced to within 70 or 80 meters of our front, all light and heavy weapons suddenly opened fire, and the enemy was immediately thrown into confusion, fleeing back in disarray. In repelling the enemy's first attack, one company, the Sixth Company of a certain unit, resisted the frontal attack of two enemy battalions. When the enemy rushed up, Deputy Company Commander Wei Xiaozhong directed the troops while personally firing at the enemy with a machine gun. The soldiers encouraged each other: resolutely hold the position and do not let the enemy break out. Under the cover of twelve aircraft strafing, the enemy struggled to launch a second attack on us. When they advanced to 200 meters in front of our position, they crawled down and refused to move forward. Enemy officers forced the soldiers to charge with pistols, but under our volley of rifles and machine guns, the enemy could not hold out and collapsed. Three enemy soldiers who failed to escape immediately surrendered their guns to us. In the afternoon, the enemy's two attacks on our positions north of the railway also failed. On the evening of the second day (the 10th), when the enemy's 104th Army desperately abandoned the 35th Army and fled south, it was immediately pursued by a powerful unit of our People's Liberation Army and was completely annihilated near Shiba Jia south of Huailai on the morning of the 11th. The enemy's 35th Army was even more isolated and tightly surrounded by our army, and was completely annihilated by the 22nd.

[Pingzhang Frontline Dispatch] Before the general offensive to encircle and annihilate the bandit Fu's 35th Army at Xinbaoan, the People's Liberation Army on the Pingzhang Frontline, in order to protect the safety of the masses, issued a letter to the people of Xinbaoan. It was distributed to the city by various means. It stated: "Fellow villagers! The complete annihilation of the bandit Fu's 35th Army is imminent. Our People's Liberation Army, firstly, in order to protect the people of Xinbaoan, and secondly, to prevent the officers and soldiers of the 35th Army who have been deceived by the bandit Fu from suffering unnecessary sacrifices, has repeatedly advised the 35th Army to surrender. If they do not surrender again, the Liberation Army will attack the city. The sooner we eliminate the 35th Army, the less you will suffer! Fellow villagers! We hope that you will quickly dig shelters in your homes and hide well to protect your own safety."

　　新保安敌突围失败记
    【平张前线电】围歼新保安傅匪战役，平张前线解放军某部，英勇顽强阻击敌人，胜利粉碎傅匪一零四军与三十五军会合突围的企图。由张家口东逃的傅匪三十五军两个师，在新保安被解放军团团包围后。傅匪作义心痛其“王牌”军行将被歼，仓惶命令其一零四军之二五零、二六九两个师，九日由怀来出发，沿永定河兼程西进，到距新保安十里的乔家营、咸滩一带，向我东八里一线阵地侧背出击。被我包围在新保安的敌三十五军一零一师，在飞机大炮配合下同时向我该线阵地猛攻，企图与其一零四军会合突围。我坚守阵地之某部指战员，在敌猛烈炮火和飞机炸射下，沉着阻击，待敌进至我前沿七八十米以内时，轻重火器突然齐发，敌人立刻混成一团，狼狈往回逃跑。在打垮敌人首次进攻中，某部六连一个连抗击敌人两个营的正面进攻。当敌人冲上来时，副连长魏效忠一面指挥部队，一面亲自端着机枪向敌人扫射。战士们互相鼓励：坚决守住阵地，不让敌人突围。敌人在十二架飞机掩护扫射下又挣扎着向我作第二次进攻，当进至我阵地前二百米时即爬下不再前进，敌军官以手枪硬逼士兵冲锋，但在我排枪机枪齐发下，敌不支溃退，未及逃跑的三个敌兵，当即向我交枪。午后，敌又向我铁道以北阵地的两次进攻，也未得逞。第二日（十日）黄昏，敌一零四军绝望地丢开三十五军向南逃窜时，立即遭受我另部强大解放军跟踪追击，于十一日晨全部被歼于怀来以南十八家一带。敌三十五军则更加孤立的被我军严密围困起来，至二十二日全部被歼。
    【平张前线电】平张前线人民解放军，在围歼新保安傅匪三十五军总攻之前，为保护群众的安全，曾发出告新保安群众书。用各种方法，向城内散发。内称：“乡亲们！傅匪三十五军的全部被歼灭就在眼前了，我人民解放军一来为了爱护新保安老百姓，二来不让那些受傅匪欺骗的三十五军官兵遭受无谓牺牲，已经多次劝告三十五军投降，他们再不投降，解放军就要攻城了。我们早一天消灭三十五军，你们就少受一天＠害，乡亲们！希望你们各家快快挖好地洞，好好躲起来隐藏，保护自身安全”。
