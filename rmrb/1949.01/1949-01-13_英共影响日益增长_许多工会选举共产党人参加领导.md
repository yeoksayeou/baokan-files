　　Growing Influence of the British Communist Party
  　Many Unions Elect Communists to Leadership Positions
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th -- The influence of the British Communist Party in trade unions continues to grow. TASS, London reports: Despite the intensified anti-communist movement by right-wing trade union leaders, an increasing number of trade union branches and committees are rejecting the Trades Union Congress's (formerly translated as the General Confederation of Trade Unions) recommendations to discriminate against communists. The Birmingham Trades Council, a major industrial city, protested the government's anti-communist actions at its annual meeting. In the election of the executive committee of the Trades Council, some communists and progressive Labour Party members who strongly opposed Bevin's foreign policy were re-elected. In response to the Trades Union Congress's malicious anti-communist movement, many local committees and branches of trade unions continue to elect communists to leadership positions. Communist Coughlin was re-elected as the Manchester District Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers. Communist David Lambourne was elected as the Chairman of the Irridbank branch of the Foundry Workers' Union, and Johnson and Wilson were elected as the Chairman and Secretary of the Dundee local branch of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers in Scotland. The Dundee branch of the National Union of Railwaymen elected three communists – David Bowman, Herbert Levanstone, and Williamson – as Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Secretary.
