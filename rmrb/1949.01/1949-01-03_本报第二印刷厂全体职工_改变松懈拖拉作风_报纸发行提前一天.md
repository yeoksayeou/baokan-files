　　The Entire Staff of the Second Printing Factory of This Newspaper
  　Changed Their Lax and Dilatory Work Style
  　Newspaper Distribution Advanced by One Day
    Adopting a Responsibility System for Each Section
  　Production Moving Towards Scientification
    [This Newspaper's News] After reviewing the publishing and distribution work in early December, the Second Printing Factory of this newspaper found that a serious shortcoming in production was the dragging and undisciplined nature of the newspaper publishing time. Generally, comrades ideologically attributed this problem to objective reasons such as the rural environment, poor machinery and tools, and low technical level. As a result, printed newspapers were often stockpiled for more than 20 hours before they could catch up with the next day's shift, greatly damaging and weakening the Party newspaper's role in guiding work in a timely manner. In response to this situation, the factory leadership proposed accelerating the Party newspaper's publishing process as a concrete goal for production efforts. After improvements in various aspects, in just one short month, newspaper distribution was advanced by one day, allowing the day's newspapers to be transported east by train to Dezhou West and to central Shanxi, and the next morning south by car to various parts of Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan. The production efficiency of various departments has improved significantly. The stereotype casting team is ahead of the standard time by one-third (e.g., if the standard time is four hours, it is now two hours and forty-eight minutes), and the printing team is ahead of the printing standard time by more than 25%. Compared to November, the time has been cut in half. The machine plate mounting time has been shortened to 71% of the standard time. Some teams, such as Bai Chenglin and Hu Zhuanlin's teams, only used 11 to 14 minutes each time (the standard time is 30 minutes). In addition, the casting team completed a 14-day plan in 12 days, and the average number of characters cast per shift was 31,400, compared to the original target of 25,000 characters. Other teams, such as typesetting, proofreading, and carpentry, have also made considerable achievements. The main reasons for these achievements are: (1) Strengthening the education of "publication serving distribution" of the Party newspaper among all employees, so that the production organization moves towards scientification and rationalization, accurately allocating and registering time, and adopting a responsibility system for each section, such as typesetting, plate making, transportation, stereotype casting, printing, and distribution, all have specified times. If a department is delayed, that department is responsible for inspection and improvement, so that both achievements and shortcomings are very clear. In addition, we have also learned from the Northeast's "crew responsibility system" and applied it to our printing rooms. Each team is assigned to use a fixed machine, which has greatly reduced the occurrence of machine failures. In the statistics for the last eight days of the month, out of 483 hours of production time, there were only seven hours of repair time. In addition, the printing of finished products has implemented a symbol system, with each machine team being responsible for the newspapers they print, which has also significantly improved the quality. (2) With the active cooperation of the Party branch and the trade union, the enthusiasm of employees in serving the Party newspaper has generally increased. Everyone feels that their work cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation, and they are all eager to improve, and have formulated personal plans one after another. In the tight spare time, a spare-time school has also been established, maintaining a one-hour study system every day. In their work, they have promoted class-fraternal production assistance. For example, if a machine in the printing team breaks down during production, another machine will help it complete the task, which not only advanced the publication time but also promoted everyone's friendship and unity. Zhang Fuchang, an old worker in the printing team, actively helps others repair machines. Comrade Jiao Yimin continued to print without leaving the machine to eat in order to gain distribution time. Zhang Huailu, Liu Sanbao, and other comrades in the stereotype casting team get up early before dawn to actively prepare, putting forward the slogan "Rather let me wait for work than let work wait for me." Now the entire factory is absorbing experience on the basis of this initial achievement, striving to improve further.

### 本报第二印刷厂全体职工　改变松懈拖拉作风　报纸发行提前一天

　　本报第二印刷厂全体职工
  　改变松懈拖拉作风
  　报纸发行提前一天
    采用各段负责制
  　生产走向科学化
    【本报讯】本报第二印刷厂在十二月初检讨出版发行工作以后，发现生产上的严重缺点是报纸出版时间的拖拉自流，一般同志思想上把这问题都推到农村环境、机器工具不好、技术不高等客观原因上去，以致使印好的报纸常有积压二十多小时才能赶上第二天的班次的，大大地损害和减弱了党报及时指导工作的作用。工厂领导方面针对这种情形，提出把加速党报出版过程作为生产努力的具体目标。经过各方面的改进，即在短短的一月中，使报纸发行提前一天，当天报纸可以经火车东向德州西、向晋中，第二天早经汽车南下晋冀鲁豫各地。各部门的生产效率，都有显著提高。浇版股按标准时间提前三分之一（如标准时间为四小时，现在则为二小时四十八分），印刷股按印刷标准时间提前百分之廿五强。以十一月比较，则缩短一半。机器上版时间缩短为标准时间的百分之七十一，白成林、胡专林等班，有每次仅用时十一分钟至十四分钟的（标准时间为卅分钟）。此外，如铸造股十四天的计划，十二天完成，每班铸字原定二万五千字，现平均为三万一千四百字。其余照制、排字、木工等股，均有不少成就。这些成绩获得的主要原因：（一）在全体职工中加强了党报“出版服从发行”的教育，使生产组织走向科学化合理化，精确支配登记时间，采用各段负责制，诸如排字、打版、运送、浇版、印刷、发行，都有规定时间，如某一部门延误，责成某一部门检查改进，这样成绩缺点，都很显明。此外，又学习了东北的“乘务负责制”，运用到我们的印刷房间，各班固定使用一部机器，因而亦大大减少了机器的故障发生。在下旬八天统计中，生产时间四百八十三小时中，只有七小时的修理时间。又如印刷成品实行了符号制，各个机器班对自己所印的报纸负责，这样使质量亦有显著改进。（二）在支部、职工会的积极配合下，职工同志对党报服务的积极性普遍提高，都感到工作赶不上形势发展的需要，都迫切要求提高，纷纷订出个人计划。在紧张的工余时间，又成立了业余学校，保持了每日一小时的学习制。在工作中，发扬了阶级友爱的生产大互助，如印刷股生产中有一架机器发生故障，另外的机器就帮助其完成任务，这样既提前了出版时间，又发扬了大家的友爱团结。印刷股张富昌老工友积极帮助别人修理机器。焦义民同志为了争取发行时间，别人吃饭他不下机继续印刷。浇版股张怀禄、刘三保等同志天不明即起，积极做准备，提出“宁叫我等工作，不叫工作等我”的口号。现在全厂正在这个初步成绩的基础上，吸取经验，争取再提高一步。
