　　“Our Troops Are Back!”
  　People Around Zhang City Warmly Welcome Our Army
    [Ping-Zhang Frontline Dispatch] The people in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou warmly support our army in combat. During the Liberation Army's operations around Zhangjiakou, whenever they arrived at a village, the villagers would run around spreading the news: "Our troops have returned!" As soon as the troops stopped, they would swarm around, some grabbing the soldiers' hands, and the first thing they would say was: "We've been waiting for you to come back!" The people on both sides of the Yang River, upon hearing that the Liberation Army had arrived, organized large cart teams and stretcher teams overnight. In the various houses and villages more than ten miles south of Zhang City, after two days of fighting, the puppet Bao chiefs all fled, and more than a dozen poor farmers automatically established a temporary village office to take care of our army's food and lodging and help transport the wounded. During the battle to block Fu bandits from breaking out of Zhang City at Nanxing Canal on the 9th, the masses braved the enemy's artillery fire, assisting our army day and night in borrowing grain and supplies. On the same day, one of our units entered Nantianmen, north of Zhang City, and that night more than twenty villagers borrowed grain and grass for our army. By daybreak the next day, a temporary village office had already been established. On the same day, fourteen war-support groups and fifteen stretchers were organized, and fifty head of livestock were dispatched to transport ammunition for our army. Seeing the troops monitoring the enemy on the mountains day and night, and the weather being so cold, they automatically found a hundred beams and more than two thousand catties of firewood, transported them to the mountains, and built thatched sheds for the troops. When the masses in Malian Beach heard that our army was going to be stationed in their village, they vacated their houses and heated the kangs to wait. The masses in the Yiping Fort area helped the troops dig fortifications, competing with the troops in a division of labor, working very enthusiastically. They also made up a jingle, shouting as they dug: "The fortifications are strong, no grain will be surrendered to the Fu bandits." During the battle at Huangtuliang, Ye Maosheng, a seriously wounded soldier from one of our units, lost contact with his unit. Yuan Zizheng, an old man from Sujiaqiao, discovered him while collecting firewood on the mountain, and went back to find people, secretly carrying him back, changing his clothes, and hiding him in the temple. The villagers sent water, food, and firewood, treating him like their own family. The villager Song Tai even took out his only packet of white sugar, Zhang Huangrong asked his children to heat the kang every day, and the old man Yuan Zizheng took care of his stool and urine day and night. Despite the fact that the Fu bandits frequently came to the village, they hid him for five days until the troops returned and邢茂生 was sent back to his unit.

　　“咱们的队伍回来了！”
  　张市外围人民热烈欢迎我军
    【平张前线电】张家口市郊外人民，热烈支援我军作战。解放军在张家口外围作战中，每到一村，老乡们奔相呼告：“咱们的队伍打回来了。”当队伍一停下来，他们立刻蜂涌围上，有的拉着战士们的手，头一句话就是说：“可把你们盼回来了。”洋河两岸的人民，听说解放军到了，就连夜组织大车队、担架队。张市城南十几里地的各家房子村，一连打了两天仗，伪保长们都跑了，十几个穷苦农民，自动成立临时村公所，照顾我军食宿，帮助运送伤员。九日在南兴渠阻击张市傅匪突围的战斗中，群众冒着敌人的炮火，日夜不停的协助我军借粮、借东西。同日，我某部进驻张市城北的南天门，当夜二十多个老乡给我军借粮草，第二天天不明时临时村公所即已成立。当天并组织了十四个战勤小组，十五付担架，还出动了五十头牲口，为我军运输弹药。他们见到部队在山上黑夜白天的监视敌人，天气又这样的冷，便自动找了一百根檩子二千多斤毛柴，运到山上，给部队搭起草棚来。马连滩的群众听说我军要到他村去驻，便把房子腾出，把炕烧热等着。宜平堡一带的群众帮助部队挖工事，和部队分工比赛，干得很起劲。他们还编了个顺口流，一面挖一面喊：“工事挖的强，不给傅匪缴官粮。”我某部在黄土梁战斗中，重伤员耶茂生和部队失了联络，苏家桥的老汉袁子正，上山拾柴发觉后，便回去找人，暗暗的把他抬回去，换了衣服，藏在庙里。老乡们送水、送饭、送柴，象对待自己的亲人一样。村民宋太，把仅有的一包白糖也拿出来，张皇荣天天叫自己的小孩去烧炕，袁子正老汉日夜的端屎、端尿，就在傅匪经常到村去的情况下，一直藏了五天，当部队重新返回来时，才把邢茂生送回自己的部队。
