Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, Moscow: Izvestia recently published an article by Alekseyev entitled "The Cost of the Arms Race," stating: The Second World War, which ended with the defeat of the fascist aggressors, has further deepened the general crisis of capitalism. The most important result of this war is the enormous growth of the Soviet Union's political and economic strength, international prestige, and influence. The combination of forces on the international stage after the war has changed in favor of socialism and to the disadvantage of capitalism. American imperialism, fattened by the war, is trying to enslave the entire world and overcome its increasingly acute internal contradictions, and to avoid or at least mitigate the impending economic crisis through an unprecedented arms race and the incitement of a war mentality. The United States ranks first in the post-war arms race: in the three fiscal years of 1946-47, 1947-48, and 1948-49, budget allocations directly for war purposes will total at least 40 billion dollars. But the actual war expenditure of the United States does not stop there. The United States also maintains civilian institutions engaged in war preparation with large sums of money, pays interest on wartime national debt, and implements the Marshall Plan, the military nature of which is universally recognized. Unprecedented growth of militarism can also be seen in Britain, France, and some other Marshallized countries. For example, military expenditures in the "peacetime" budgets of Britain after the war in 1946-47, 1947-48, and 1948-1949 reached 3.2 billion pounds, eight times the war expenditure before the war in 1938-39. Some military expenditures are also listed under "non-military" items in the budget. The French government is also following the path of national militarization. War-related expenses have increased year by year: from 179 billion francs in 1946 to 244 billion francs in 1947. In the 1948 budget, war expenses totaled 300 billion francs, accounting for nearly 35 percent of the total budget, while in 1938, war expenses in the budget accounted for 27 percent of the total budget. The unscrupulous arms race means the systematic swelling of the high profits of monopoly capital, and the further absolute and relative impoverishment of the broad masses of the people. The excess profits of monopoly capital can be proved by the following fact: the profits of the 16 largest steel companies in the United States (accounting for 81 percent of the nation's total steel ingot production) increased by 54 percent in the third quarter of 1948 compared with the third quarter of 1947. The profit curve of British monopoly capital is also rising sharply.
	The increase in budget allocations for the arms race and the "tax-free" policy for monopoly capital profits (non-labor income tax has been reduced to almost one-third of its original level in the three years since the Labour Party came to power in Britain) has created a national budget deficit. For example, in the three years that the Labour Party has been in power, the British budget deficit has reached 1.783 billion pounds, more than 2.7 times the national budget of 1938-39. In the United States, due to the preservation of heavy direct and indirect income taxes on the working masses during the war, the revenue for the 1946-47 and 1947-48 budget years exceeded expenditure. However, the U.S. budget for 1948-49 will have a deficit of $1.545 billion. In order to balance revenue and expenditure, the governments of imperialist countries have no choice but to resort to new loans and use the printing press, which has further exacerbated the disconnect between national finance and currency circulation.
	The financial machinery of the post-war arms race is cruel and ruthless. The increase in direct and indirect income taxes on the working people (it is enough to point out that indirect taxes on essential commodities in Britain have increased by 50 percent in the two years after the war. Indirect taxes alone have caused workers to hand over 30 percent of their income to the national budget), the rapid increase in national debt, and the worsening of inflation are the actual financial situation in countries on the path of militarization. However, the working people are increasingly aware that the frantic arms race, apart from the terror of imperialist war, further absolute and relative impoverishment, unemployment, enslavement, and the pain of returning to barbarism and moral depravity, has no benefit for the people.

### 军备竞赛的代价　苏联消息报

　　军备竞赛的代价 　 苏联消息报
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷发表亚力克赛也夫题为“军备竞赛的代价”的论文称：以法西斯侵略者的败北告终的第二次世界大战，已使资本主义总危机进一步的深刻化。这次战争最重要的结局，就是苏联政治经济力量、国际威信和影响的巨大增长。战后国际舞台上力量的组合，起了有利于社会主义而不利于资本主义的变化。在战争中养肥了的美帝国主义，力图奴役整个世界，并通过空前的军备竞赛与煽起战争的心理，来克服日形尖锐的内部矛盾，来避免或最低限度缓和行将到临的经济危机。美国在战后的军备竞赛中居于第一位：在一九四六——四七年、一九四七——四八年和一九四八——四九年的三个年度中，直接作战争用途的预算拨款，最少将达四百亿元。但是美国实际的战争开支并不止此。美国还以大笔金钱维持从事于战争准备工作的民间机构，偿付战时国债的息金和实施马歇尔计划，这个计划的军事性质是众所公认的。在英国、法国和其他一些马歇尔化的国家，也可以看见军国主义的空前滋长。譬如，英国战后一九四六——四七年、一九四七——四八年、一九四八——一九四九年的“平时”预算中的军事开支，达到卅二亿镑，为一九三八——三九年战争前夕之战争用途费用的八倍。若干军事开支也被列入预算中的“非军事”项目下。法国政府也同样遵循着国家军事化的道路。战争项下费用逐年都有增加：从一九四六年的一千七百九十亿法郎，增加到一九四七年的二千四百四十亿法郎。一九四八年预算中，战争费用共达三千亿法郎，几占全部预算的百分之三十五，而在一九三八年，预算中的战争费用占全部预算的百分之二十七。肆无忌惮的军备竞赛意味着垄断资本高度的利润之有系统的胀大，与广大人民进一步绝对的与相对的贫困化。垄断资本的超额利润，可以由下面的事实来证明：美国十六家最大的钢铁公司（占有全国全部钢块生产能力的百分之八十一），一九四八年第三季的利润，较一九四七年第三季增加百分之五十四。英国垄断资本的利润曲线也急剧上升。
    预算中充作军备竞赛的拨款的增加和垄断资本利润的“免税”政策（在英国工党政府当政以来的三年中，非劳动所得税已几乎减少至原来的三分之一），造成了国家预算的赤字。例如，在工党当政的三年中，英国预算赤字达到十七亿八千三百万镑，超过一九三八——三九年国家预算的二点七倍。在美国，由于保存战时对劳动群众苛重的直接与间接所得税，一九四六——四七年与一九四七——四八年预算年度的岁收超过了开支。但是，美国一九四八——四九年的预算，赤字将达十五亿四千五百万元。帝国主义国家的政府，为了要使收支相抵，就不能不求助于新的贷款和利用印钞机，这样，就使国家财政和货币流通的脱节更加严重。
    战后军备竞赛的财政机器是残酷无情的。劳动人民直接和间接的所得税的增加（只消指出这一点就够了，英国首要必需品的间接税，在战后两年中增加了百分之五十。仅仅间接税，便已使工人将其收入的百分之三十交给国家预算。）国债的迅速增大，通货膨胀的恶化，这些就是军国主义化道路的国家中实际的财政情形。但是，劳动人民愈来愈认识到，疯狂的军备竞赛，除了帝国主义战争的恐怖，进一步的绝对与相对贫困化，失业、受奴役，回复到野蛮和道德沉沦的痛苦之外，对于人民什么好处也没有。
