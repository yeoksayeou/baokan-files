　　Escaped Landlords Should Be Forced to Labor and Obey the Law After Returning to the Village; Tagang Prevents Illegal Activities of Returned Landlords
    [Taihang News] Tagang Village, Qi County, committed serious errors in the work of resettling escaped landlords. After Jixian County was liberated, escaped households returned to the village one after another. Due to the district leaders' one-sided emphasis on "leniency," the village did not deal with the returned landlords according to whether they had committed crimes or the magnitude of their crimes, but simply flattered and accommodated them, even inviting them to meals everywhere, thus fueling the landlords' reactionary arrogance and "counter-offensive" activities. Landlord Li Zuofeng openly threatened the masses on the street, saying, "The Kuomintang's power is still great!" and went to the homes of his former tenants to "borrow" grain, "borrowing" six dou of rice and wheat in just one day. They were also unwilling to accept the government's call for production labor. One landlord's wife said, "Meetings are just to call for labor! It's better not to have them!" Many landlords were borrowing and asking for things indiscriminately, and attempted to take the opportunity to settle old scores, spreading rumors that "mistakes were made in the past struggles, and what belongs to whom should be returned to them." These situations aroused the indignation of the peasants, especially the emancipated peasants, and dissatisfaction with the cadres. The general reaction was: "What merit is there in escaped landlords returning? Why give them food for nothing?" The district authorities realized the seriousness of the matter and began to conduct self-criticism. On the tenth of last month, it convened a people's representative conference in the village, and exposed the landlords' conspiracies and illegal activities at a mass meeting, affirmed the correctness and rationality of the land reform movement, and determined that in the future, landlords should be forced to engage in labor in order to reform them. The masses discussed and said, "This is reasonable, and it speaks to our hearts."
    (Editor's note: After escaped landlords return home, they should be made to live by labor, but in addition to exposing the above-mentioned landlords' illegal activities, the grain they took from the masses by threatening methods should be returned in full, and measures should be formulated to resolutely correct their illegal activities.)

　　逃亡地主回村后
  　应强制他劳动守法
  　塔岗制止归来地主违法活动
    【太行讯】在安置逃亡地主工作上，淇县塔岗村犯了严重的错误。汲县解放后，逃亡户纷纷回村。由于区领导上片面强调“宽大”的结果，该村对待逃亡归来的地主不是按其有无罪恶或罪恶大小，分别处理，只是一味奉承迁就，甚至到处请吃饭，因而助长了地主的反动气焰与“反攻”活动。地主李作丰，公开在街上威吓群众说：“国民党的力量还大着哪！”并到原先佃户家里去“借”粮，仅一天就“借”了米麦六斗。政府号召生产劳动，他们也不愿接受，一个地主女人说：“开会就是叫劳动！还不如不开哩！”很多地主都是乱借乱找，并企图乘机进行倒算，造出谣言说：“过去都斗错了，该谁的还得归谁。”这些情形引起农民特别是翻身农民的义愤和对干部的不满。普遍反映：“逃亡地主回来有啥功？为啥白给他吃？”区上发觉事情的严重，开始作了检讨，于上月十日在该村召开了人民代表大会，并在群众大会上揭发了这些地主的阴谋与非法活动，肯定了土地改革运动的正确合理，确定了今后对地主要实行强迫劳动，以资改造。群众议论着说：“这样做才合理，讲的对心思”。
    （编者按：逃亡地主回家后，应使其劳动生活，但对上述地主的非法活动，除予以揭发外，其用威胁办法拿去群众的粮食等，应照数退回，并应订出办法，坚决纠正他们的非法活动。）
