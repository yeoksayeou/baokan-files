Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 4th: Surrounded in the northeast Yongcheng area, officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang bandit army under Du Yuming, have seen more than 3,000 of their number surrender to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) during the seven days from December 25th to the end of the month. Although the bandit Du implemented strict surveillance of his subordinates to prevent soldiers from escaping, and concentrated soldiers' weapons at night (except for sentries) for collective sleeping, the enemy officers and soldiers, in order to save themselves and survive, still disregarded all threats and continued to surrender to the PLA. Some sentries even carried their weapons with them when they were on duty and came to surrender. Moreover, some enemy battalion commanders, as well as company and platoon leaders, also led entire battalions, companies, and platoons of armed soldiers to surrender collectively. On the night of the 26th, a certain company commander of the 498th Regiment of the 166th Division of the enemy 9th Army led four squads of soldiers to surrender to the PLA. On the night of the 27th, the battalion commander, deputy battalion commander, and company commander of the Second Battalion of the 759th Regiment of the 253rd Division, as well as a platoon leader of the 753rd Regiment, led two squads of soldiers to surrender. On the night of the 29th, an enemy squad leader of the 70th Army, trapped in Dou'ao, killed the platoon leader and led the entire squad to surrender. On the night of the 30th, a battalion of the 95th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the enemy 79th Army, led by Battalion Commander Yan Zhiliang and the Second Section Chief of the division headquarters, collectively surrendered to the PLA. On that night, the number of enemy officers and soldiers who surrendered reached 824. The enemy officers and soldiers who had just surrendered immediately asked for food upon seeing the PLA. Many of them were so severely hungry that they fainted on the ground as soon as they ran over. In total, since November 16th, more than 5,000 officers and soldiers of the enemy Qiu and Li corps have surrendered, equivalent to the strength of more than one enemy division.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 29th: Belated news: Under the severe torment of hunger, the bandit troops of Du Yuming are in low morale and their military spirit is wavering. Entire battalions and companies are surrendering to the PLA and handing over their weapons. According to incomplete statistics, in the four days from December 4th to 7th alone, as many as three entire battalions and six entire companies of Chiang's bandit army surrendered to the PLA. Hundreds of other scattered enemies also fled to surrender every day. On the afternoon of the 5th, Teng Hongchen, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Independent 9th Regiment of the 41st Army, who was trapped in Wangbailou, came to request surrender and was accepted by the PLA. That night at 10 p.m., Teng Hongchen led four entire companies of men and guns to surrender to the PLA. On the 6th, when the PLA attacked Shuiwazhuang, they rescued more than a dozen Kuomintang soldiers who had been captured by the enemy for surrendering to the PLA and tied to trees awaiting execution. However, any atrocities by the bandit chiefs could no longer stop this life-seeking action of their subordinates. On the same day, more than 300 soldiers of the artillery battalion of the 46th Division of the enemy 5th Army surrendered to the PLA despite being chased by enemy machine guns, and several wounded and sick soldiers who could not run also desperately pulled on the horses' tails and ran over.

According to Yuan Zhuancong, the company commander of the 7th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 366th Regiment of the 122nd Division of the enemy 41st Army, who led his entire company and weapons to surrender to the PLA at Shuiwazhuang, "We will die if we stay, and we will die if we retreat (referring to being killed by the bandit 'supervisory team'). If we want to live, the only way is to surrender." On the morning of the 9th, sixteen enemy soldiers fled to the PLA's Taozhuang position, and the enemy's "supervisory team" fired on them. Han Zhongqin, a sapper of the 496th Regiment of the 166th Division of the enemy 9th Army, who was running at the front, rushed into the PLA's trench breathlessly and said, "Damn it, I don't care about my life anymore! As long as you can't catch up and can't kill me, I'll have a way out!" On the night of the 11th, 147 officers and soldiers of the 4th Detachment of the enemy Xuzhou "Suppression Headquarters," led by Staff Director Yan Ci, surrendered to the PLA. They also disguised their families as soldiers, carrying guns together to defect to the PLA. The PLA warmly welcomed the enemy officers and soldiers who surrendered, providing them with meals and treating the wounded. The enemy officers and soldiers who surrendered were greatly moved and asked to go back to persuade others to surrender. Chen Yixian, a secretary of the enemy Sun Yuanliang Corps headquarters, immediately went back and told many people after surrendering: "The PLA has prepared meals for us, whoever wants to live, come with me." Immediately, he brought back more than a hundred people. Cao Qingchuan, a soldier of the 510th Regiment of the 170th Division of the enemy 8th Army, who surrendered to the PLA, brought back a large number of propaganda materials and a few steamed buns when he went back for the second time. He said that this would make many people believe even more that only by surrendering to the PLA is the only way to survive.

　　被围杜聿明匪部官兵
  　七天中三千人投降
    【新华社淮海前线四日电】被围困在永城东北地区的国民党匪军杜聿明部官兵，自十二月二十五日至月终的七天中，又有三千多人向解放军投降。虽然杜匪为防止士兵逃跑，对其下级官兵实行严密监视，夜间除哨兵外，将士兵枪支集中，实行集体睡觉。但是敌军官兵为了自救求生，仍不顾一切威胁，不断向解放军投降。有些哨兵在放哨时即携带枪支前来投降，而且有些敌营长及连、排长也带领整营、整连、整排的武装士兵集体投降。二十六日夜，敌第九军一六六师四九八团某连长带领四个班士兵向解放军投降。二十七日夜，二五三师七五九团二营营长、副营长、连长等及七五三团一个排长率两个班士兵投降。二十九日夜，困守窦凹敌七十军一个班长，打死排长后，带领全班投降。三十日夜，敌七十九军三十二师九十五团一个营，在营长阎志良及该师司令部第二科科长带领下，集体向解放军投降。该日夜，敌投降官兵，共达八二四名。刚投降过来的敌军官兵，一见到解放军即要求吃饭。他们中许多困饿得太厉害，刚跑过来即晕倒地上。综计自十一月十六日以来，敌邱、李两兵团投降官兵已达五千余人，相等于敌军一个多师的兵力。
    【新华社淮海前线廿九日电】迟到消息：在严重的饥饿煎迫下的杜聿明匪部，士气颓丧，军心动摇，整营整连向解放军缴械投诚。据不完全统计，十二月四日至七日四天内，向解放军投降的蒋匪军即达三个整营与六个整连，其他零星逃来投降的敌人每日也有数百人。五日下午，困守王白楼的四十一军独九团二营营长滕鸿臣前来请求投降，当被解放军接受。当晚十时，滕鸿臣便率领四个整连人枪向解放军投诚。六日解放军攻入水洼庄时，解救了十几个因向解放军投诚被敌捉回绑在树上等待处死的国民党军士兵。但匪首的任何虐杀都已无法阻止其部下此种求生的行动。同日敌五军四十六师炮兵营三百余人便冒着敌机枪的追击投降了解放军，几个跑不动的伤员和病员也都拚死的拉着马尾巴跑了过来。
    据在水洼庄率全连人枪向解放军投诚的敌四十一军一二二师三六六团三营七连连长袁专聪说：“我们守着也是死，后退也是死（指被匪‘督战队’打死），要想活着，只有投诚。”九日上午，敌军士兵十六人向解放军桃庄阵地逃来，敌“督战队”以火力追击，跑在最前面的敌九军一六六师四九六团工兵韩忠勤气喘喘地一股劲冲进解放军的战壕里说：“妈的，不要命啦！只要你追不上打不死，我就有生路了！”十一日夜，敌徐州“剿总”四支队官兵一百四十七人，由参谋主任严慈率领向解放军投降，他们亦将家眷化装成了士兵扛着枪一齐投奔解放军。解放军对敌投降官兵表示热烈欢迎，除招待他们吃饭外，并替受伤人员医治伤口。敌投降官兵大受感动，纷纷要求回去劝降。敌孙元良兵团司令部书记官陈翼先于投降后，立即又回去告诉许多人说：“解放军已经给我们准备好饭了，谁想活命的跟我走吧。”一下子便又带来了一百多人。向解放军投降之敌第八军一七零师五一零团士兵曹晴川第二次回去带人时，除携进大批宣传品外，还带了几个馍馍，他说这将是使许多人更加相信：只有投降解放军，才是唯一的生路。
