　　Divorce Should Be Considered Carefully

　　Question: I am Li Yaomin from Li Xin Village, Sixth District, Guan County. When I was seventeen, my mother arranged a forced marriage for me, and I had thoughts of divorce then. Later, for two years, I worked in the village office, usually staying in the dormitory. Later, I left agricultural production to work, and it has been three years. There has been no marital relationship. I first proposed a divorce. My family and she advocate divorce without leaving the home, but I firmly advocate leaving the home, so it has not been resolved for three years. She is very capable in farm labor, so my family does not agree to the divorce. I submitted it to the county judicial section the other day. The government replied that a divorce cannot be granted if the woman does not agree. Both parties must agree and register with the government. Can this marriage of mine be dissolved?

　　Answer: Since your wife is good at labor, your marital relationship should continue. If you care for her and love her, she will not be without love for you. This issue cannot only be considered from your own perspective, but you should also think about her. Marital love is created by both parties and cannot be blamed on one party alone. Please reconsider this issue.

　　离婚要慎重考虑
    问：我是冠县六区李辛村人，在十七岁时由我母亲做主给我强行结了婚，那时我便有离婚思想。以后二年，我在村办公，即常住更房，后来就脱离生产参加工作，至今三年，夫妇关系没发生过，以先提出离婚，家人和她主张离婚不离家，我坚决主张离家，所以三年之久没得解决；而她在家劳动很强、因此家人不同意离婚，前日呈县司法科，政府回电说：女方不同意不能判处离婚，非得双方同意了到政府登记才行，现在我这婚姻是否能离？

    答：你的妻既然劳动很好。你们的夫妻关系就应该继续下去，如果你对她很关心，很爱护、她对你也不会没有爱情。这个问题不能只从自己方面想，也应该替她想想，夫妻爱情是双方创造出来的，不能单怪一方，这个问题请你重新考虑一下。
