Gao Wenshan Speaks Well
　　This Year is a Year of Victory

　　Dear Comrades:

　　In the blink of an eye, this year is about to pass. Are you all in good health? Is your work going well? You have liberated so many cities this year and achieved so many victories, so this year is a year of victory. In the past few years, we were oppressed by the enemy and couldn't afford to eat or wear clothes. Now we have enough to eat and wear, and this is all thanks to you. Dear soldiers, I salute you. Now you have liberated many places, but there are still some cities that have not been liberated. I wish you all the best in the front lines. Please don't worry about your families. Village cadres will take care of the affairs at home. Do not relax your combat efforts and capture that bastard Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible.

　　I wish you more victories.

　　Respectfully,

　　　　　　　　　Elementary School, Yian Village, Second District, Huolu County, Gao Wenshan

　　高稳山说得好
  　今年这个年是胜利年亲爱的战士同志们：
    转眼间这一年就要过去了。你们的身体健康吗？工作也好吧？今年被你们解放了的城市真不少，得到胜利也不少，所以今年这个年是胜利年。我们前几年被敌人压迫得吃不上也穿不上，现在我们已经有吃有穿了，这都是你们的功劳，亲爱的战士们，我向你们敬礼。现在你们解放了的地方很多，可是还有一些城市没有解放，祝你们在前方再加一点油，千万不要挂念家里，家里的事情有村干部来担任，你们不要放松作战，早日捉住那个王八旦蒋介石。
    祝你们多打胜仗
    敬礼
