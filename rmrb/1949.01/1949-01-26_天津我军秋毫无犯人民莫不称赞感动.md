Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 24th: The People's Liberation Army, upon entering Tianjin, displayed strict discipline and committed no offenses, earning the praise of the people of Tianjin. A certain regiment, upon storming the No. 7 Textile Factory in the northern suburbs of the city, annihilated the enemy's 26th Division headquarters. Not only were all documents and materials within the factory left untouched, but even non-military supplies such as towels, cups, and leather shoes in the enemy division headquarters' rooms were left as they were, with no one moving them. The People's Liberation Army, which occupied the No. 3 and No. 4 Textile Factories in the southern part of the city, also upheld discipline and received praise from the military control commission personnel and gratitude from the factory workers. A factory employee said to the PLA personnel sent to check on discipline: "Your comrades, besides capturing the Kuomintang troops, did not take anything. Many houses were not even entered. We have never seen such a good army." From the evening of the 15th to the morning of the 16th, the unit did not start fires to cook because grain and firewood had not yet arrived, and also because they had not received instructions from higher authorities regarding prices, making it inconvenient to purchase them. They continued to eat the dry rations they had brought with them during the battle. When local residents learned of this, they were deeply moved and offered to send them food and porridge, but the soldiers politely declined. A certain unit captured a large amount of grain and biscuits from the bandit army. Whether in whole batches or scattered pieces, they were all counted and reported to higher authorities. No one took anything for personal use. After the battle, commanders and fighters remained in their assigned rooms and rarely went out to stroll around. The People's Liberation Army also stipulated that all mules and horses were prohibited from entering the city, so there was no congestion of people and horses on the streets. The people of Tianjin, who had suffered greatly under the bandit army's oppression, witnessed the exemplary behavior of the People's Army and praised it unanimously.

　　天津我军秋毫无犯人民莫不称赞感动
    【新华社天津二十四日电】进入天津的解放军，纪律严明，秋毫无犯，受到天津人民的赞扬。某团攻入城北郊的中纺七厂内，歼灭敌军二六师师部，不但对所有厂内文件物资原封不动，连敌师部房间内的各种非军需物资如毛巾、缸子、皮鞋等物品亦照旧安放，无人动弹。攻占城南中纺三厂和四厂的解放军，也同样坚守纪律，受到军管会接管人员的赞扬和厂内职工的感谢。该厂职员对解放军派往检查纪律的人员说：“你们同志除了捉拿中央军外，没有拿一点东西，很多房子都没有进去，真是从来没见过这样好的队伍。”该部自十五日晚到十六日晨，因粮食柴草未运到，又因未得到上级关于物价的通知，不便购买，便没有起火作饭，仍然吃着战斗中所带的干粮，当地居民知道了，十分感动，纷纷向他们送饭送粥，但都被战士们婉言谢绝。某部缴获匪军许多粮食饼干，无论是整批的或是零散的，都一一统计报告上级，没有一人私自取用。指战员在战斗结束后，都留在驻地房内，很少出去游逛。解放军并规定所有骡马禁止入城，因此街道没有人马拥挤现象。备受匪军蹂躏的天津人民，亲眼看到人民军队此种模范行为，无不交口称赞。
