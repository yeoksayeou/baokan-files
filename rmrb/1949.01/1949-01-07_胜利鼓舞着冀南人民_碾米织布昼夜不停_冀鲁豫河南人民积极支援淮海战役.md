[Hebei South Electric] To welcome the upcoming national victory, the people of southern Hebei are working day and night to weave military cloth and mill military rice, actively supporting the front lines. Guangping Third District’s military cloth task was 12,500 bolts. With the continuous efforts of 5,934 women in the district, 6,175 bolts have been handed over. In the spinning and weaving movement, Party member cadres specifically divided the work to carry out current affairs education, publicizing the victory news from the front lines, further encouraging the women's enthusiasm for spinning and weaving. They rock the spinning wheels and sing happily: "The army wins victories in the front, we should weave cloth...". Women in various villages in Ji County, upon hearing the current affairs propaganda about the complete liberation of the Northeast and the fundamental defeat of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in about a year, competed to weave military cloth and asked to weave more, guaranteeing fast and dense weaving. In Chenjiazhuang, 84 households volunteered to weave 142 bolts of military cloth. Liang Xiaolin's wife, who is over 40 years old, took care of her three children and volunteered to weave three bolts of military cloth. Li Xiuqun said: "If we don't contribute now, when will we? I'll weave two bolts!" Wang Jixiang's wife in Xinzhuang, Wucheng County, encouraged by the victory, spins seven or eight spindles every night before going to sleep, and spins again when she wakes up. There are countless such model examples everywhere. The masses in Zhang Buquan Village, En County, excitedly accepted the task of milling military rice, proposing "Mill one more grain of rice, and old Chiang will die one day earlier; guarantee fast, fine, and clean milling." All seven mills in the village, some pushed together, some pulled by livestock, milled more than 30,000 catties of grain in two days and nights. The masses said: "This rice will make our army eat their fill, so they can fight great victories!" Xixiaohe Village has only 50 households, 35 full laborers, and 16 livestock; three mills and one winnowing machine were not enough, so everyone used dustpans to winnow the chaff, rushing to mill 1,800 catties of rice in one afternoon and one night. In Qinghan Village, Gucheng, village cadres and Party members took the lead in leading, dividing the rice milling groups, and setting off a competition to ensure no waste and no broken rice. With the joint efforts of cadres and the masses, they completed the task of 40,000 catties of military rice in six days.

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric] Cadres and masses south of the Yellow River who have persisted in guerrilla warfare for a long time are ecstatic to hear of the great victory on the Huaihai front. They are working with a hundred times the effort to complete the task of transporting grain to the People's Liberation Army. When the task of supporting the front was passed on to the Qibin Second District, the masses dug the grain out of the underground caves that night. All the men, women, old and young in the village scrambled to mill and pound rice, and the children sang while pounding rice. Some women and children forgot their fatigue, and even though their hands were blistered, they did not rest. Some villages spontaneously proposed competitions to ensure that the rice was fine and good, and delivered quickly, completing the task according to plan. Li Qinghe, a poor peasant in Bali Temple, Chenji District, Dingtao, pushed 50 catties of grain and helped others mill 110 catties of grain. He also helped the district cadres go to other villages to supervise. Anlingji collectively pounded rice. The whole village was divided into platoons, with men, women, old and young concentrated in several fields, digging many pits, pounding and winnowing, launching a competition, pounding the rice finely and quickly. From the 14th and 15th, counties successively began to transport rice, organizing into squads, platoons, companies, and battalions by district. They transported it to the front day and night. Junantang Village District is a newly liberated area. The first batch of grain transported was 50,000 catties, and it took five days and five nights to complete the task. Their rice was fine and the bags were neat. Many models have emerged in various counties during the grain transportation. Liang Yujia of Anlingji transported grain in the rain, taking off his cotton coat and covering it on the rice bags. He said: "If the cotton coat gets wet, it can be dried, but if the rice gets wet, it will not taste good." Many people followed his example, using quilts and cotton coats to cover the rice bags to protect the rice being transported.

    【冀鲁豫电】长期坚持游击战争的黄河以南干部群众，欣闻淮海前线大捷，兴奋若狂，正以百倍紧张的努力来完成供给解放军的运粮任务。支前的任务传到齐滨二区的时候，群众当夜就将谷子从地洞里扒出来，全村男女老幼争先恐后的碾米捣米，儿童们一面捣米一面在唱。有的妇女和儿童忘记了疲劳，手上磨了血泡，也不休息。有的村群众自动提出竞赛，保证米又细又好，交的快，照任务完成。定陶陈集区八里庙贫农李庆合，把五十斤谷子推完，又帮助别人碾谷一百一十斤。他还帮助区干到外村去督促。安陵集集体捣米，全村以排为单位，男女老少集中在几个场里，挖了很多地凹，捣的捣、簸的簸，发起了竞赛，米捣的又细又快。十四、五号各县均先后开始运米，以区为单位，组织了班、排、连、营。他们不分昼夜的向前方输送。钜南堂村区是新解放区，第一批运粮五万斤，一连走了五天五夜，完成了任务。他们的米又细，袋子又整齐。各县在运粮中均涌现了不少模范。安陵集梁玉家冒雨运粮，把自己的棉大衣脱下盖在米袋上。他说：“棉袄淋湿了还可以晒干，米要淋湿就不好吃了。”不少群众都学他的样，用被子、棉袄盖在米袋上保护运米。
