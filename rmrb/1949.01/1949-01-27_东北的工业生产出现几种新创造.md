Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 24th: Several new creations have recently emerged in Northeast China's industrial production.

　　(1) Xiao Xiangji of the Jiamusi City Grain Bureau, along with ironworker Zhang Zhenfa and two other workers, invented a grain dryer. The successful trial of this machine will make a significant contribution to the work of national grain warehouse management. When in use, the grain is automatically passed through the machine via a hoist, and after about two minutes of heating, all the moisture is evaporated, while maintaining the grain's fresh color and preventing blackened grains. The machine can also freely lengthen or shorten the grain's running time within the machine, according to the amount of moisture contained in the grain. The machine can dry 60,000 jin of grain containing 13% moisture, 72,000 jin of grain containing 10% moisture, and over 80,000 jin of grain containing 8% moisture per ten hours.

　　(2) Workers at the ball bearing factory of the Xinhua Machinery Factory in Liaoning Province have recently manufactured a ball bearing retainer (which maintains the balance and durability of steel balls in machines), which is very important in industry. During the puppet Manchukuo period, retainers were secretly manufactured in Japan and then shipped here. Chinese workers had no idea how to make them. Now, with the encouragement and help of the factory's leadership, the workers have finally completed the task after painstaking research.

　　(3) Wang Sihe, a sand-molding worker at the Sankeshu Railway Factory of the Harbin Railway Bureau, independently designed and created a large pig iron reduction furnace (i.e., a cast iron furnace) after more than a month of research. The function of this furnace is to melt useless iron filings, steel filings, and scrap iron into good pig iron. According to test results, the molten iron is clear and not pasty, which can solve the problem of raw material shortages for some factories producing sand castings.

　　(4) Zhai Shilong, the factory director of the Jiamusi Railway Engine Depot, together with his fellow workers, researched and experimented for more than two months and created a threading lathe. This lathe can produce sixty 3/8", 1/2", and 5/8" screws per hour. It can produce thirty 3/4" screws, and fifteen 7/8" and 1" large screws. Compared with the old method of threading screws, its production efficiency is increased by more than four times.

　　东北的工业生产出现几种新创造
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】东北的工业生产最近又出现了几种新的创造。
    （一）佳木斯市粮食局肖祥吉与铁工工友张振发等三人，发明了粮食干燥机。此机试验成功后，对国家粮食仓库管理工作上有重大贡献。该机在使用时，将粮食经升降机自动从机中通过，约经两分多钟热力的烘烤，全部水分即被蒸发出来，并保持粮食色泽新鲜，没有发乌的粮粒。该机更能根据粮内所含水分的多少，自由延长或缩短粮食在机内的运行时间。该机每十小时可干燥含有百分之十三水分的粮食六万斤，百分之十水分的粮食七万二千斤，百分之八水分的粮食八万斤以上。
    （二）辽宁省新华机械工厂滚珠厂工友，近自制了工业上很重要的滚珠保持器（保持机器中钢珠的平衡及经久耐用）。保持器在伪满时是从日本秘密制成后运来，中国工人根本不知其造法。现在该厂工友在该厂领导机关的鼓励与帮助下，经过苦心研究，终告完成。
    （三）哈尔滨铁路局三棵树铁道工厂翻砂工人王嗣和，经月余钻研，自制图案，造成了一种生铁还原的大炉（即铸铁炉）。此炉的作用是将无用的铁末、钢末、杂铁等熔化成好生铁。据试验结果，铁水清而不浆，可解决某些工厂翻砂品原料缺乏的困难。
    （四）佳木斯铁路机务段工厂主任翟世隆协同工友，经两月余研究和试验，创造了一种绞螺丝床子，该床子每小时可出三、四、五分的螺丝六十个，六分的可出三十个，七分和一英寸的大螺丝，也可出十五个，与以旧法绞螺丝相比，其生产效率提高四倍以上。
