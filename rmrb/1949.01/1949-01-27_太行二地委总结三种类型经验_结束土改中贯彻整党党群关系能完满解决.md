The Taihang Second District Committee summarized three types of experience to ensure the completion of the Party rectification during the land reform:

1.  Focus on the relationship between the Party and the masses. The Second District Committee believes that the various problems existing in the Party (such as commandism, violations of law and discipline, and impure class composition) are mainly caused by the Party's isolation from the masses. Therefore, in this Party rectification, all counties have mobilized the masses to participate in evaluating Party members and cadres, revealing various shortcomings and mistakes of the Party and Party members, and organizing the masses to criticize and educate Party members and cadres. This ensures that Party members and cadres can conduct self-criticism based on the opinions of the masses, thereby achieving the goal of thorough ideological rectification.

2.  Pay attention to different situations. The Second District Committee believes that the concrete conditions of each village and Party branch are different. Some are mainly about clarifying class alignment, some are mainly about correcting work style, and some are mainly about organizational issues. Therefore, the methods of Party rectification should be adjusted accordingly. For example, for villages and Party branches with serious problems of impure class alignment, the masses should be boldly mobilized to conduct thorough investigations and handle them seriously. For villages and Party branches where cadres' work style is crude and commandist, the method of “unbuttoning” should be adopted, allowing the masses to speak freely and help cadres correct their mistakes.

3.  Firmly rely on activists. The Second District Committee believes that, during the land reform and Party rectification, it is essential to firmly rely on activists and give full play to their role. Therefore, all counties have paid attention to discovering and cultivating activists among the masses, absorbing them into the Party, and promoting them to leadership positions at various levels. At the same time, activists are organized to study policies and methods, improving their understanding and working ability. This ensures the smooth progress of land reform and Party rectification.

Through the above three types of experience, the Taihang Second District Committee has effectively promoted the progress of Party rectification during the land reform, ensuring the successful completion of land reform and further consolidating the Party's ties with the masses.
