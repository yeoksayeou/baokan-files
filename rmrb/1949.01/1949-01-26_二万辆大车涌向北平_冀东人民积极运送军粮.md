[Jidong Telegram] Under the slogan of "Guaranteeing Adequate Food for the Troops," the people of Eastern Hebei are accelerating the transportation of grain, oil, salt, and vegetables. An average of 20,000 carts per day are continuously surging towards the Beiping front. The highways are teeming with long convoys of rubber-wheeled carts, iron-wheeled carts, handcarts, man-pulled carts, shoulder poles, and back carriers. From December 19th to 27th, in eight days, the masses in Baodi County completed the task of transporting 3.2 million catties of war grain and 200,000 catties of war grass. Children and women in Nanlizigu Village, District Eight, also organized themselves to help load the carts. In Dongdian Village, when there were not enough sacks for transporting grain, the masses took out chests for storing clothes to hold the grain. In Dong'anzicun Village, when there were no livestock to transport rice, they organized man-pulled carts, small pushcarts, or carried grain on their backs. When the county received an urgent task to transport grain on the 20th of last month, they launched a surprise transportation effort of 300,000 catties of grain in one day and night. The masses proposed: "Those who can load 1,000 catties should load 1,500 catties, so that the troops can eat quickly!" Small pushcarts also doubled their loads, some carrying more than 170 catties. In the disaster areas of Qinglong and Qingping counties, there was a lack of livestock and the urgent needs of the troops could not be met. The masses near the highway voluntarily carried their little remaining grain on their backs to the supply stations. Afterwards, the local government allocated grain to replenish them. On one occasion, when a grain transport cart passed the Qinglong River at night, because there was no bridge over the river, most of the vehicles were trapped in the water. The cart drivers, disregarding the cold, went into the water to push the carts and carry the grain. The masses in the large and small Niulan villages near the railway kept boiling water late at night to entertain the passing transportation teams, and helped to lead the way and lift the carts. The grain transportation work in various places mostly adopted the contract system. When Shunyi District One transported grain to the Beiping front, a contract fee of seven catties of millet was given for every 100 catties transported 100 li. The masses were willing to load more, with each cart carrying at least 1,000 catties. The masses in the Shunyi Chengguan New District, who had suffered greatly from the ravages of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits in the past, were particularly active in transporting grain. Farmer Li Xing said, "Our democratic government is really good! They even give transportation fees for transporting grain. As long as we eliminate the Chiang bandits, we would be happy even if we didn't get anything!"

　　二万辆大车涌向北平
  　冀东人民积极运送军粮
    【冀东电】在“保证部队食粮充足”的口号下，冀东各地人民加速运输粮食、油、盐、蔬菜，每天都平均有两万辆大车络绎不绝地涌往北平前线。公路上川流不息地过着胶皮大车、铁轮车、手推车、人拉车、肩担、人背等漫长的运输行列。宝坻县群众自十二月十九日至二十七日八天里，共完成运送战粮三百二十万斤、战草二十万斤的任务。八区南里字沽村的儿童、妇女也组织起来帮助装车。东甸村运粮的口袋不够，群众拿出装衣服的箱子来装粮。东安子村运米没有牲口，就组织了人拉车、小推车或背着运粮。上月二十日该县接到运粮的紧急任务时，曾在一昼夜间突击运输了三十万斤粮，群众提出：“该装一千斤的装一千五百斤，好赶快给部队吃！”小推车也加倍装粮，有装一百七十多斤的。青龙、青平两县灾荒区缺乏畜力，供不上部队的急需，公路附近的群众自动把自己仅存的一点粮食，背着送到供应站去。事后，当地政府即分别拨粮补还他们。某次，运粮车夜间路过青龙河，因河上无桥，大部车辆都陷在水里，赶车民工不顾寒冷，下水推车、背粮。铁路附近大小牛兰庄的群众，深夜不停地烧水，招待过路运输队，并帮着带路抬车。各地的运粮工作，大部采用了包运制，顺义一区往北平前线运粮时，实行百里百斤发给小米七斤的包运费，群众都愿意多载，每车至少载一千斤，顺义城关新区群众过去受尽蒋傅匪的蹂躏，运粮中特别积极，农民李兴说：“咱们民主政府真好！运粮还给运费，只要消灭蒋匪，啥也不给我们也乐意！”
