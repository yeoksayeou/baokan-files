[Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] The industry and mining along the Pingzhang Railway Line after liberation are being actively restored and rebuilt. In Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Xiayuan, among the more than 30 factories and enterprises formerly under the jurisdiction of the puppet Chahar Provincial Enterprise Company and the puppet Resources Committee, which were taken over by the Military Control Commission, the ones that have resumed work by the 16th include the power plants in Xiayuan and Zhangjiakou, the Yantongshan Mining Area affiliated with the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua, the Longyan Machinery Factory, and the Zhangjiakou-named oil pressing plant, brewery, glassware factory, rubber factory, lumber mill, flour mill, and food factory. The largest locomotive factories along the PingSui Railway in Zhangjiakou and Nankou have never stopped production. The Xuanhua Paper Mill, the Xuanhua Oxygen Plant, and the Jimingshan Coal Mine in Xiayuan have largely completed the inventory and sorting of old raw materials and supplies, and are now starting to assemble and purchase the necessary equipment and raw materials to fully prepare for the resumption of work. The largest coal-producing area along the Pingzhang Railway Line, the Baoxing Coal Mine in Xiayuan and more than 60 other coal mines, suffered from capital shortages and were heavily in debt due to the price and transportation restrictions imposed by the bandit Fu before our army recovered them. After the recovery, the Military Control Commission successively lent 300 dan of sorghum and 50,000 jin of millet to various private mines to help them restore and expand production. Recently, a contract was signed with Baoxing Coal Mine to purchase 4,200 tons of coal and charcoal by paying for grain and funds first and then delivering the goods, so that the mine's funds can be circulated normally. The number of miners in the mine has increased from 88 at the time of the recovery to 468, and the daily output has surged from 46 tons at the time of the recovery to 236 tons. Together with the more than 460 tons of coal produced daily by the other 46 small mines in the area, the fuel problem of the major towns and railway factories along the Pingzhang Railway Line has been substantially guaranteed. In this great and arduous restoration and reconstruction work, the workers of each factory have shown a high degree of labor enthusiasm with a new attitude. After liberation, the Zhangjiakou and Nankou locomotive factories have overhauled six locomotives and more than ten carriages, and are rushing to manufacture a large number of spikes and splints for the overhaul of the western section of the PingSui Railway. The output of spikes in the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Factory has increased from the initial four pans of ore, 400 pieces per day, to 800 pieces. Workers Gao Wenbin and Li Enzhong of the factory successfully completed a certain component replacement work with a high degree of research spirit, and the time used was only two-thirds of the original schedule. After nine days of effort, the workers of the Xiayuan Power Plant have completed the inspection and repair of the giant generator and started sending electricity on the 7th of this month. At present, the power supply for factories and mines and commercial and civilian use in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Xiayuan has been substantially satisfied. They are thoroughly inspecting, repairing, and scrubbing a small generator, and repairing the water tower, building a chip machine and a coal-carrying high car. Workers in the Zhangjiakou Power Plant are repairing a wind-resistant car for a small generator to ensure the continuous supply of huge power to various factories.

　　平张沿线接收工作良好
  　三十余工矿厂正重建
    【张垣电】解放后的平张线工、矿业，正积极恢复与重建。在张垣、宣化、下花园三地，由军管会所接收之原伪察省企业公司，及伪资源委员会等所辖三十余个工厂、企业中，截至十六日止，已复工者计有下花园、张垣两地发电厂，宣化龙烟铁矿所属烟筒山采矿所，龙烟机器厂，及以张垣命名之榨油厂、酿造厂、料器厂、橡胶厂、制材厂、面粉厂、食品厂等，平绥路最大之张垣、南口两地机车厂，则始终未中断生产。宣化造纸厂，宣化氧气厂下花园鸡鸣山煤矿等单位，旧有之原料、物资，业已大体清查整理完毕，现正着手装配，购置必需之器材原料，为复工作充分准备。平张线最大之产煤区，下花园宝兴煤矿等六十余座煤矿，在我军收复前由于傅匪之限价、限运，以致资金困乏，欠债累累。收复后，军管会先后以高粱三百担、小米五万斤，借与各民营矿井，扶助其恢复与扩大生产。最近，复与宝兴煤矿订立合同，以先付粮、款，后交货的办法，向其订购煤、炭四千二百吨，使该矿资金得以正常流转。现该矿矿工，已由刚收复时之八十八人，增至四百六十八人，每日产量则已由刚收复时之四十六吨，激增至二百三十六吨。连同该地其他四十六座小型矿井每日所产之四百六十余吨煤炭，平张线主要城镇铁路工厂之燃料问题，已获得相当保证。在此伟大而艰辛之恢复与重建工作中，各厂职工均以新的姿态表现了高度的劳动热忱。张垣、南口两机车厂，解放后已抢修机车六辆，车箱十余节，并正为抢修平绥路西段路轨，而赶制大量道钉、夹板。张垣机车厂道钉产量已由最初之四盘矿，日产四百个，增至八百个。该厂工人高文彬、李恩重等以高度研究精神，顺利的完成了某种机件补配工作，而所用时间，仅为原订时间的三分之二。下花园发电厂工人经过九日努力，已将巨型发电机检查修理竣事，并已于本月七日开始送电。目前张垣、宣化、下花园等地工厂、矿厂电力供应及商民用具已获得相当满足。正在彻底检查、修补擦洗一座小型发电机，并整修水塔，建造碎片机及运煤高车。张垣发电厂工人，正在为一座小型发电机修补抗风车，以保证各工厂巨大电力的持续供应。
