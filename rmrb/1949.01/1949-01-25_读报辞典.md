　　World Federation of Trade Unions
    ——Since the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Union Committee in November 1941, it laid the foundation for a unified world trade union organization. After Shvernik, the former chairman of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions, proposed to "expand the Anglo-Soviet Trade Union Committee to absorb trade unions from the Americas and all invaded countries to participate in the organization," the fourth session of the Anglo-Soviet Trade Union Committee in October 1944 decided to convene a World Trade Union Congress. On February 6, 1945, the World Trade Union Congress was held in London, with more than 200 representatives from trade union groups from 38 allied countries and 7 neutral countries, representing 60 million organized workers. At the meeting, based on the motion of Kuznetsov, chairman of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions, and Hillman, chairman of the Political Action Committee of the American Federation of Labor, a resolution to establish the World Federation of Trade Unions was passed. In September of the same year, the World Federation of Trade Unions was officially established in Paris, including progressive trade unions from 64 countries, with 70 million members. Its organizational structure is the General Assembly, the Executive Committee (21 members), and the Executive Bureau (9 members). The composition of the World Federation of Trade Unions is very complex, with the most progressive, such as the Soviet Trade Unions, and trade unions influenced by the right-wing social democratic opportunist tradition. However, for three years, it has gradually grown stronger in the struggle to defend world peace, democracy, and the interests of the working class, and in the struggle against the agents of American and British imperialism and internal right-wing trade union bosses. According to incomplete statistics, the World Federation of Trade Unions now has 80 million members. Because the World Federation of Trade Unions is the most important organization for the working class in the struggle against the reactionaries, against the propaganda and preparation for a new war, and for the consolidation and lasting peace of all nations, American imperialism and its assistants have begun to use various means to sabotage and split the World Federation of Trade Unions from the day it was born. They blocked the World Federation of Trade Unions from participating in the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. In November 1947, they demanded that the World Federation of Trade Unions discuss the Marshall Plan, attempting to split it from within. In addition, the conspiracy of American imperialism to dismantle the two major pillars of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the General Confederation of Labor of France and Italy, also failed. Last March, the reactionary American and British trade union bosses convened an international trade union congress of scabs in London, attempting to establish a "Trade Union International" opposed to the World Federation of Trade Unions, but it failed due to opposition from progressive trade unions around the world.

　　Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
    ——It is the special service of the United States, an organization belonging to the U.S. Department of Justice. Founded in 1908, its director is J. Edgar Hoover, the most insidious spy boss in the United States. The headquarters is located in Washington, D.C., with fifty-one branch bureaus. More than 70% of Americans (the total population is more than 145 million) have had their fingerprints taken by this special service, creating more than 2 million blacklists, and arbitrarily monitoring, tracking, and arresting any American. Under it is a "FBI National Academy" that trains special agents, who then go on to train police special agents, specializing in anti-communism and persecution of progressives, exiling 124 American communists, arresting 40 American communist leaders (including美共主席福斯特, chairman of the American Communist Party, and twelve other leaders last July), suppressing the workers' movement, arresting workers, and now wants to spread the network of special agents overseas.

　　世界职工联盟
    ——自从一九四一年十一月苏英职工会委员会成立以后，就给统一的世界职工组织奠定了基础。苏联前任职工会中央委员会主席什维尔尼克动议“扩大苏英职工会委员会吸收美洲以及一切被侵略国家工会参加组织”以后，一九四四年十月，苏英职工会委员会第四届会议上就作出了召开世界职工大会的决定。一九四五年二月六日，世界职工大会在伦敦召开，与会的共有三十八个同盟国，七个中立国的职工团体代表二百多人，代表了六千万有组织的职工，会上根据苏联职工会中央委员会主席库滋涅佐夫及美国劳联政治形势委员会主席希尔曼的动议，通过了建立世界职工联盟的决议。同年九月，世界职工联盟，正式成立于巴黎，当时包括六十四国的进步的职工会，拥有会员七千万人，它的组织机构为代表大会，——执行委员会（二十一人）——执行局（九人）。世界职工会的成份是非常复杂的，有最进步的，如苏联职工会，也有受右翼社会党机会主义传统影响的职工会。但是三年来，它在保卫世界和平、民主和工人阶级利益的斗争中，在和美英帝国主义的代理人及内部右翼工会头子的斗争中，逐渐发展壮大起来。现在据不完全统计，世界职工联盟，已有会员八千万。因为世界职工联盟，是工人阶级在为反对反动派、反对新战争的宣传及准备、争取各民族巩固与持久和平的斗争中的最重要的组织，所以，美帝国主义及其助手们，从世界职工联盟降生的那一天，就开始用各种手段进行破坏和分裂。在联合国中阻止世界职工联盟参加社会经济理事会，一九四七年十一月，又要求世界职工联盟讨论马歇尔计划，企图在内部分裂它，此外美帝企图拆散世界职工联盟两大台柱法、意两国总工会的阴谋也未得逞。去年三月，美英反动的职工会头子，又在伦敦召开了工贼头子的国际职工大会，企图成立与世界职工联盟对立的“职工国际”，但因为遭到全世界进步职工的反对，而失败了。
　　美国联邦调查局
    ——是美国的特务机关，属于美国司法部的一个组织。成立于一九○八年，局长是美国最阴毒的特务头子虎弗，华盛顿设有总局，有五十一个分局，百分之七十以上的美国人（全人口为一亿四千五百多人）被这个特务机关留下了指印，制造了二百多万黑名单，随便监视、跟纵与逮捕任何一个美国人。在它之下设有一个“联邦调查局国家学院”，训练特务，这些特务再去训练警察特务，专门反共和迫害进步人士，放逐了一百二十四个美国共产党员，逮捕过四十个美共领袖（去年七月美共主席福斯特等十二位领袖也在内），镇压工人运动，逮捕工人，现在还要把特务网撒到海外去。
