Awakened Workers Join the Communist Party
　　A Record of the Admission Ceremony for New Party Members at the Shijiazhuang Electricity Company

　　The Shijiazhuang Electricity Company held a public ceremony on the evening of December 29th for new party members to take their oath of admission.

　　As soon as it got dark, the lights in the auditorium shone with a dazzling red light from the windows. The four characters "Workers' Home" above the entrance to the auditorium were illuminated by dozens of electric lights, displaying the joy and pride of the workers.

　　Around 7:00 PM, the reporter entered the brightly lit venue, where more than twenty workers had already arrived. The largest round lamp, adorned with a hammer and sickle, hung from the ceiling in the center of the room, surrounded by national flags. The banner with the ten characters "Workers of all countries, unite!" hung on the wall facing the entrance, with two large red flags below it, followed by five large portraits. This was the rostrum, also the platform for new party members to take their oath. Slogans such as "Welcome awakened workers to join their own party" and "Welcome workers to criticize and supervise our party" were posted on the walls and in every corner.

　　More and more people arrived. There were already twenty veteran party members, eight new party members, and more than twenty non-party worker comrades in the venue. At 7:30, the chairman announced the start of the meeting, and the atmosphere shifted from joyful to solemn silence.

　　The first to speak was Comrade Wang Qiming, a member of the General Branch Committee. He first explained the significance of today's meeting, and then said: "Of the eight comrades joining the Party today, seven are workers, most of whom took the initiative to request joining the Party. This shows that after a year of Shijiazhuang's liberation, the consciousness of the working class has greatly improved under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the Party enjoys a high reputation among the masses." Finally, he emphasized: "New party members have not received Party education in the past and do not know enough about Party building, so they must humbly learn from veteran party members. Veteran party members must also help these new comrades and more humbly learn from the non-party worker comrades and newly admitted comrades, learning from their excellent class style. Only in this way can we consolidate and strengthen the unity within the Party and the unity between the Party and the masses; only in this way can we keep up with the development of the situation."

　　The next speaker was Manager Lin of the company. He said, "The proletariat should be internationalist. After achieving their own liberation, they should also help the class comrades who have not yet been liberated in the world to achieve liberation." Manager Lin continued to explain the discipline of Party members. Then, the introduction and oath-taking of Party members began. After the new party members took their oath, Comrade He Guang, the secretary of the General Branch, once again emphasized the call for "continuing to strengthen unity and learning in the future."

　　Finally, the new party members spoke. Comrade Chen Ruilin, a 25-year veteran worker, was the first to step onto the stage. He was not used to speaking in public, and because of his excitement and agitation, he spoke with difficulty: "In the past, I have not joined any party, and I advocated not joining any party, because I could not stand that society, and I could not stand those parties; When the Communist Party first came, I also had concerns about the Communist Party, but when I saw the simple and hardworking spirit of the Communist Party cadres - take the leaders of our company, for example, they work with us, when we leave work, they are still working, more tired than us - this is serving the people, only the Communist Party can do this, I realized this, and resolutely requested to join the Party. But I am old and have not received Party education, and my education level is low. I hope comrades will help me a lot so that I can become a good Communist Party member. I have better things to say, but I can't say them, everyone should watch my performance in future work!" After Chen Ruilin finished speaking, the other new party members also spoke one after another. The sixth speaker was Hao Zhengxuan (staff member), who said: "In the past, I also thought about not joining any party, but later I saw the benefits of the Communist Party, knew what it was doing, and when I saw some party members going to meetings, I couldn't participate, and I felt very uncomfortable, I couldn't bear it, so I went to talk to Comrade Wang Qiming..." It was already eleven o'clock when the meeting ended. The reporter followed the crowd out of the auditorium. A worker from the electrical engineering department (non-party member) walking next to the reporter said with great passion: "Look how solemn it is for Communist Party members to join the Party, you can tell at a glance that it is a serious matter! Damn it, what does the Kuomintang's muddleheadedness count for!" (Mu Yang)

　　觉悟的职工参加共产党
  　记石市电灯公司新党员入党仪式
    石家庄市电灯公司，于十二月二十九日晚举行新党员入党宣誓的公开仪式。
    天刚黑，礼党里的电灯就从窗子里放射出耀眼的红色光芒。礼堂门口的“工人之家”四个大字，被十数盏电灯照耀着，它显示着工人的喜悦与骄傲。
    七时许记者进入充满了红色灯光的会场，早已有二十多个工人来了。一盏贴着斧头镰刀的最大的圆灯，悬挂在屋子中央的花板上，万国旗围绕着它。“全世界无产者联合起来”十个大字横额，挂在迎门的墙壁上，下边是两面大红旗，再下边是五幅大像。这是主席坛，也是新党员入党的宣誓坛。“欢迎觉悟了的职工参加自己的党”。“欢迎职工批评、监督我们的党”…………等标语张贴在墙上和每个角落里。
    人越来越多了，会场里已有二十个老党员，八个新党员和二十多个非党的职工同志。七点半钟主席宣布开会，会场由喜悦转成严肃的寂静。
    第一个讲话的是总支委王启明同志，他首先说明了今天的开会意义，接着说：“今天参加党的八位同志有七位是工人，绝大部分是自己主动向党提出要求的。这说明了石家庄解放一年后工人阶级的觉悟在共产党的领导下已大大的提高，党在群众中享有很高的威信。”最后他着重指出：“新党员过去没有受过党的教育，对党的建设不够了解，这样就必须虚心的向老党员学习；老党员也必须帮助这些新同志，更虚心的向党外的工人同志和新入党的同志学习，学习他们优良的阶级作风。这样才能巩固与加强党内的团结、党群的团结；只有这样才赶得上形势的发展”。
    继起讲话的是公司林经理，他说：“无产阶级应该是国际主义的。自己获得解放了，还应该帮助世界上尚未获得解放的阶级同志获得解放。”林经理继续解释了党员纪律性。后即进行党员介绍与宣誓。总支部书记贺光同志在新党员宣誓后，并重新着重提出了“今后应努力加强团结与学习”的号召。
    最后新党员讲话了，二十五年的老工人陈瑞林同志，第一个走上讲台，他是个不习惯当众讲话的人，又由于兴奋、激动所以说起话来很吃力：“过去我没有参加过什么党派，我主张什么党派也不参加，因为我看不惯那个社会，看不惯那些党派；共产党才来的时候，我对共产党也有顾虑，可是当我看到共产党的干部那种简朴和埋头苦干的精神——就拿咱们公司的首长们来说吧，和咱们一道工作，咱们下工走了，他们还在工作，比咱们都累——，这是为人民服务，只有共产党才能这样做，我认识了这点，才坚决请求入党。可是我的岁数大了，没有受过党的教育，文化程度也低，希望同志们多多帮助我，让我能成为一个好共产党员。我还有很好的话，可是我说不出来，大家看我在今后工作中的表现吧！”陈瑞林讲完话，别的新党员也都相继发言，第六个是郝正轩（职员），他说：“从前我也是想什么党派也不参加，但以后我看清楚了共产党的好处，知道他是干什么的，看到有的党员去开会，自己不能参加，心里就很难过，蹩扭的没办法了，我才找咱们王启明同志去谈………。”散会时已是十一点了。记者随着人群走出了礼堂。走在记者旁边的一位工电科的工人（非党员），很激情的说：“你看共产党员入党多么严肃，一看就知道是正事！妈的，国民党那胡里胡涂的算个什么！”　（穆扬）
