　　Tianjin: Our Army Continues to Capture Two More Enemy Army Commanders
　　Lin Weichou and Liu Yunhan Captured
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Front, 16th] In addition to the capture of the bandit Tianjin Garrison Commander Chen Changjie, the People's Liberation Army, which liberated Tianjin, has now identified Lin Weichou, commander of the 62nd Army, and Liu Yunhan, commander of the 86th Army, among the captured Kuomintang military officers. The People's Liberation Army finally ended the battle at 3:00 AM on the 15th. The previous telegram mistakenly stated 1:30 AM on the 15th. Therefore, the time from the start of the attack to the end of the battle should be 29 hours, not the 27 and a half hours mentioned in the previous telegram.

    【新华社平津前线十六日电】解放天津的人民解放军除已俘获匪天津警备司令陈长捷外，现又在俘虏的国民党军官中，查获六十二军军长林伟俦和八十六军军长刘云翰。解放军最后结束战斗是在十五日上午三时，昨电误为十五日上午一时半，因此，自攻击至解决战斗止应为二十九小时，而非前电所称的二十七小时半。
