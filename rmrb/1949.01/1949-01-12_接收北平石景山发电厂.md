To the comrades of the factory communications editorial board:

　　There were five of us, and we arrived at the Shijingshan Power Plant on the morning of the 20th. We first contacted the stationed troops, and through the introduction of the stationed troops, we met with the person in charge of the power plant, Deputy Director Engineer Yu. He expressed great pleasure upon meeting us. The information about the plant introduced by Director Yu is recorded below:

　　The power plant has a total of more than 1,060 employees, with four generators, totaling 55,000 horsepower of machinery. This power plant is managed by the Beiping Electric Power Company. During this liberation, all machines and materials were well protected. All the workers are in the factory. Of the more than 80 staff members, only a few went to Beiping and have not returned; all others are in the factory. Therefore, this factory is complete and undisturbed. It was liberated on the 15th and began supplying electricity on the 17th. It is now supplying electricity to Nanyuan, Fengtai, Qinglongqiao, Changxindian, Mentougou, Tsinghua, Yanjing, Haidian, and other places. The higher authorities also ordered the plant to supply electricity to Beiping, because even though the Fu Zuoyi bandit gang was in Beiping, the higher authorities feared that the lack of electricity would affect the normal life and order of the people. The machines have now been started.

　　The course of protecting the factory: On the 14th of this month, the war around Shijingshan was very fierce. An enemy company was stationed in the power plant. At that time, the enemy ordered the company to change defenses, and another battalion was to come. When the enemy troops in the power plant had left, and the replacement enemy troops had not yet arrived, suddenly eight or nine Liberation Army soldiers came and rushed into the power plant through the gate. They went straight up to the fifth floor of the machine room. At that time, they told the workers not to be afraid. In the staff office downstairs, Director Yu sent pancakes, boiled water, and scrambled eggs to the Liberation Army soldiers. At this time, all the employees were very nervous.

　　The enemy replacement troops arrived and started shooting as soon as they entered the gate. An enemy battalion advanced into the power plant from many places and asked Director Yu why there were Eighth Route Army soldiers upstairs. Director Yu said, "We don't know; they are all wearing yellow uniforms, and there are 'Nationalist Army' sentries at the gate. Who knows who the Liberation Army is?" The enemy battalion commander immediately wanted to call their regimental headquarters on telephone 313 to report. However, Director Yu and other staff members secretly told the telephone operator not to connect to telephone 313. At that time, the telephone operator was a little scared, but after the staff members agreed to take responsibility for him, he deliberately made the telephone malfunction and could not connect. When the enemy battalion commander said he would bombard the building with artillery, Director Yu and many employees said, "The machines upstairs are the rice bowls of all the employees, and Beiping urgently needs electricity." The enemy had no choice but to not fire the cannons. The enemy also wanted the workers to lead them upstairs, but there was only one staircase. An old worker was threatened and had to lead them upstairs. Unexpectedly, as soon as they reached the fourth floor, they were shot at from above. The enemy troops who went up were thrown into chaos and rolled down the stairs.

　　The few Liberation Army soldiers had already controlled the highest point of the power plant, posing a great threat to the enemy troops. Although the enemy had a battalion, and even the regimental headquarters later came to the opposite mountain, they were ultimately helpless against this power plant and could only use rifles and machine guns to shoot at it. The eight or nine Liberation Army soldiers upstairs fired in all directions. They held on like this for half a day and a night. At night, the Liberation Army soldiers upstairs released a signal. The next morning (the 15th), our troops also arrived. When the enemy saw the large army coming, they panicked and quickly ran to the opposite mountain. Our army followed closely and pursued them, inflicting many casualties on the enemy. Thus, our army quickly occupied the mountain. The enemy had nowhere to escape, and most of them fell into the pool and drowned (the enemy regimental commander also drowned). We also captured many enemy soldiers. The battle ended like this.

　　There are many bullet holes in the walls of the building, and one transformer was punctured, leaking some oil. But it was immediately patched up. There were also a few holes in other machines, but they were not serious. The entire staff of the power plant and our eight or nine Liberation Army soldiers protected the only large power plant in North China.

　　We have been here for two or three days and have learned some information about the power plant: The power plant belongs to the Beiping Jibei Electric Power Company, which belongs to the Resources Committee, and the Resources Committee is led by the puppet government's Executive Yuan. Generally, the staff members have a cultural level of university or high school graduation. Most of these technicians and staff members are very good. In addition, the reactionary trade union here belongs to the Beiping Municipal Party Department. (The Party Department belongs to the CC clique.) The chairman of the trade union is the secretary of the sub-district department. The trade union used petty favors to buy off some of the workers, verbally claiming to be fighting for the welfare of the workers, but in reality, it was consolidating the power of the CC clique. Some workers who didn't understand only felt that the trade union was doing things for them and suppressed the staff members so that they didn't dare to raise their heads. After liberation, everyone showed great pleasure, and the chairman of the trade union did not run away.

　　Some of the staff and technical personnel have concerns. The reason is that many landlords ran to Tianjin and Beiping during the land reform and often spread rumors. A few people were deceived, and the enemy fabricated many false struggles to promote, repeatedly exaggerating, saying: "Isn't the money for intellectuals to study also from exploitation? They should be struggled against!" Therefore, a terror of "struggling against intellectuals" was created, so some technical personnel ran around here and there.

　　This time, the technical personnel and general manager of the Beiping Electric Power Company did not run away because they saw that the general trend of China made it seem like there was nowhere to run. In addition, they also noticed that the technical personnel who did not come out during the liberation of Changchun, Jinzhou, Shenyang, Jinan, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou were not only not struggled against but were also treated very well. Therefore, the technical personnel of the Electric Power Company decided not to leave. However, they still do not understand many aspects of our policies. In these few days, they have raised many questions, and we have explained them one by one.

　　After being here for a few days, we have a few feelings about taking over the work of various departments in Beiping: The general staff here have a high level of education, are very sensitive to things, and are deeply poisoned by enemy propaganda. In such a complex environment, if the people who come to work here do not have a deep understanding of our Party's policies, saying a single word casually can have a great impact. When we explain some problems, we should consider them carefully and not exaggerate too much. For example, saying how good the liberated areas are will give them too high of an ideal. Saying how hard-working and enduring we are will give them a concern about being afraid of hardship. For example, after we came to the power plant, they dared not buy meat to eat, and the engineers also ate cornmeal. I don't know where they heard it from, saying: "The Communist Party does not allow eating meat or eating good food." The staff members' understanding of the bad things the enemy did is not yet profound enough, and we should pay special attention to our propaganda methods.

　　接收北平石景山发电厂
    英人
    工厂通讯编辑同志：
    我们一共五个人，在二十日早晨到石景山发电厂。最先与驻军联络，经过驻军的介绍，我们会见了电厂负责人，发电厂副主任于工程师。见面后他表示很愉快。兹将于主任介绍厂内的情形记在下面：
    电厂职工共有一千零六十多名，有四个发电机，一共是五万五千马力的机器。这个发电厂属于北平电力分公司管理。这次解放，所有机器材料都被保护得很好。工人全体都在厂内。八十多名职员只有几个人去北平未回来，其他全在厂内。所以这个厂子是完整无缺，毫不紊乱。十五日解放，十七日就送电了。现在已送到南苑，丰台、青龙桥、长辛店、门头沟、清华、燕京、海甸等处。上级又令该厂给北平送电，虽然傅作义匪帮在北平，但上级怕没有电影响人民正常生活与秩序。现在机器已开好了。
    保护厂子的经过：本月十四日在石景山的周围战事已很激烈了，电厂内驻敌军一个连，当时敌军令该连换防，再来一个营，当电厂的敌军已走了，接防的敌军还未到的时候，忽然来了八九个解放军，由大门冲入电厂。一直走上机器房的五层楼顶上去。当时他们告诉工人不要害怕。在楼下的职员办公室，于主任派人送了烙饼开水，和炒鸡蛋给解放军。这时全体职工情绪都很紧张。
    敌人接防军队来了，一进大门楼上就开枪打起来了，敌人一个营由许多地方向电厂里开进，并且找于主任问他为什么楼上有了八路军。于主任说：“我们不知道，都穿黄衣服，门前又有‘国军’的站岗的，谁认识哪个是解放军呢？”敌军营长即要叫电台给接三一三电话给他们的团部报告。但是于主任及其他职员等偷偷告诉电话员，不要接三一三电话。当时电话员有些害怕，可是经过职员们愿意给他作主，他故意把电话弄的不灵了，接不上。当敌营长说要用大炮轰击大楼时，于主任及许多职工就说：“楼上的机器是全体职工的饭碗，同时北平要电很急”。敌军只好不开炮了。敌军又要工人带着往楼上冲去，但只有一个楼梯，一个老工人受威胁，只好带着他们上楼。不料刚上到四楼，上面就开枪了。上去的敌军一乱，都滚到楼梯下面。
    解放军几个人已控制了电厂的最高点，对敌军的威胁很大。敌人虽然有一个营，甚至，后来团部也来到对面山上，但是对这座电厂始终无可奈何，只有用步枪、机关枪射击。楼上的八九个解放军，向四面开枪了，就这样相持半天一夜，夜里，楼上的解放军放了信号。第二天（十五日）早晨，我们的队伍也赶到，敌军一见大军来了，就慌作一团，赶紧往对面山上跑。我军紧跟追击，敌伤亡很多，于是我军很快占了山头。敌军无处逃跑，大部分掉到水池子里淹死了，（敌团长也淹死了。）我们又生俘到许多敌兵。这个战斗就这样结束了。
    大楼墙上枪眼很多，打漏了一个变压器，曾经流出一些油。但立时也包扎好了。另外的机器上打了几个洞，都不要紧。电厂的全体职工及我解放军八九个战士就这样把华北唯一的大发电厂保护住了。
    我们来了两三天，了解一些电厂内的情形：电厂属于北平冀北电力公司，公司属资源委员会，而资源委员会属伪政府行政院领导。一般职员文化程度都是大学、高中毕业的。这些技术人员与职员大部分都很好。另外，这里的反动工会属于北平市党部。（党部是属于ＣＣ的。）工会理事长是区分部书记。工人有三百多是集体入党的，工会以小恩小惠收买了一部分工人，口头上说是为了给工人争福利，实际上是给ＣＣ巩固势力。个别工人不了解的，只觉得工会在给他们办事，反把职员压的不敢抬头。解放后大家都表现得很愉快，工会理事长也没有跑。
    职员和技术人员有些人有顾虑。原因是土改时许多地主，跑到平津来时常乱造谣。个别人受了骗，敌人又捏造了许多假斗争来宣传，一再扩大说：“知识分子念书的钱还不是剥削来吗，应该斗争！”因此造成了一个“斗争知识分子”的恐怖，所以有些技术人员跑到这里跑到那里的乱跑一阵。
    这次北平电力公司的技术人员及总经理都没有跑，因为他们看到中国的大势已觉得无处可跑了。另外他们也注意到解放长春、锦州、沈阳、济南、开封、郑州等地未出来的技术人员不但没有被斗争而且都很受优待。所以电力公司的技术人员决定都不走了。不过他们对我们的政策还有许多不太了解之处。这几天他们提出许多的问题，我们都一一的给了解释。
    来了几天，对于接收北平各部门工作我们有几点感觉：这里一般工作人员文化程度都高，对事情也很敏感，敌人的宣传的毒也深。在这样复杂的环境中我们来工作的人如果对我党的政策了解不够深刻，随便说一句话，影响也是很大的。当我们解释一些问题时，应该慎重考虑，不要过于夸张。如说解放区怎样好，会给他们理想太高。说我们生活如何吃苦耐劳，又会给他们一个怕吃苦的顾虑。比如电厂的伙房在我们来了以后，他们不敢买肉吃，工程师也吃棒子面了。不知他们由哪里听来的说是：“共产党不准吃肉不准吃好的。”职工们对敌人的坏处认识还不到深刻的程度，我们宣传方式上也应该特别注意。
