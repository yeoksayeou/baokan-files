　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 12th: Before fleeing Shangqiu City on the Longhai Railway, the Kuomintang bandit army under Qiu Qingquan and others demolished most of the civilian houses at the city's four gates and engaged in rampant looting. Outside the brick city of the East Gate and in the areas of Wenyage, Qianhouge, and other places north of Xuqiao, over 800 civilian houses were demolished by the bandit army; between the brick city of the North Gate and the ten cities, and inside and outside the earthen city, a total of 353 civilian houses were demolished. The bandits also "confiscated" all the demolished bricks, tiles, and lumber. When the bandit army demolished the houses, thousands of residents from the four gates of Shangqiu petitioned the bandit army authorities, but the inhuman Chiang bandits used machine guns to shoot and disperse the petitioners. Before fleeing on November 5th last year, the 181st Brigade looted all the goods, bedding, livestock, and furniture of over 300 households in the city, leaving the affected people to wander the streets, begging for a living. After the city was liberated on November 6th last year, the people successively accused the bandit army of atrocities to the People's Liberation Army, demanding that the bandit army be completely annihilated to avenge them. In addition to demolishing all the bunkers in the city and returning the bricks and lumber to their original owners to rebuild their houses, the democratic government has also provided appropriate relief to the disaster-stricken people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 13th: Frontline reporters reported the scene of the final destruction of Du Yuming's bandit army under the powerful attack of the People's Liberation Army, stating: After three days of fierce fighting, at dusk on the 9th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive toward Chen Guanzhuang, where Du's "Suppression Headquarters" and the bandit Second Corps headquarters were located. When the People's Liberation Army attacked, the chaotic soldiers designated a place for them to fire, and various guns were immediately piled up. The groups of prisoners, like a raging tide, stretched as far as the eye could see, escorted eastward by the People's Liberation Army. When reporters asked: Which unit are you from? They immediately reported various unit numbers, while others replied: I can't mention it! We're from all over. These enemy soldiers, who had been hungry for a long time, immediately swarmed over and fought each other when they occasionally found a piece of dry food dropped by the People's Liberation Army on the ground. Hundreds of captured vehicles were guarded by People's Liberation Army soldiers on the temporary airport built by Du Yuming, busily transporting supplies. From Chen Guanzhuang to Luji, enemy soldiers everywhere used parachutes to set up shelters to protect against the wind and snow. Huge caliber howitzers, American-style mountain guns, and various guns and ammunition, mixed with newly captured tanks and armored vehicles, were piled up like mountains. Chiang's planes, which came to "airdrop," were still hurriedly dropping canned food, biscuits, and ammunition. A soldier with twelve rifles on his back said playfully: "Don't drop any more, I can't carry any more."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 13th: With the victorious conclusion of the Huaihai Campaign and the removal of the great enemy in the Central Plains, the spearhead of the People's Liberation Army's offensive is about to point to the Kuomintang-controlled areas south of the Yangtze River. Intensifying the preparations for crossing the river has become the major task of the military and civilians in the Central Plains. The CCP Central Plains Bureau and the directly subordinate organs of the Central Plains Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, at the New Year's Day victory celebration, focused on conducting ideological mobilization among the cadres to prepare for crossing the river. At the same time, they called on everyone to boldly and thoroughly mobilize and educate the broad masses of the people, so that they clearly understand that crossing the river is to completely defeat the Kuomintang reactionary rule, drive out the aggressive forces of American imperialism, and seek permanent liberation and a peaceful life for the people of the whole country, that is, for the people of the Central Plains. The Central Plains has the advantage of geography, and the military and civilians of the Central Plains should take on this glorious task first. It was also pointed out that some new difficulties may be encountered in crossing the river and after crossing the river, but as long as there is sufficient preparation ideologically and organizationally beforehand, it will not be difficult to overcome them. Since we went south last year, we have overcome many difficulties, and we believe that we will certainly be able to conquer any difficulties in the future. Comrade Liu Zijiu, Minister of Propaganda of the Central Plains Bureau, emphasized: "We must resolutely carry the great people's liberation war to the end and liberate the people of the whole country who have been under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang for a long time." Comrade Li Da, Chief of Staff of the Central Plains Military Region, called on cadres to prepare for crossing the river, to strengthen organizational unity, establish regular systems and styles, resolutely implement the Party's various policies, oppose undisciplined anarchy, and strive for the early realization of national victory. The meeting also sent telegrams to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the officers and soldiers on the Huaihai Front to express their respect and congratulations. The former telegram stated: In 1949, we pledge to complete the new tasks assigned to us by the Party Central Committee with a new war posture. The latter telegram stated: On the favorable basis of the great victory on the Huaihai Front, we will further mobilize the people in the rear to support the front, eliminate the remaining enemies in the Central Plains, and do all the preparatory work for advancing into Jiangnan.

　　解放军进攻矛头指向江南
  　中原军民准备渡江
    【新华社中原十二日电】国民党匪军邱清泉等部于逃离陇海路上之商邱城前，曾将该城四关民房大部拆除，并大肆抢劫。东关砖城外及徐桥北文鸦阁、前后阁等地民房，共被匪军拆掉八百余间；北关砖城与十城之间及土城内外，共被拆掉民房三百五十三间。该匪并将所拆之砖瓦木料全部“充公”。当匪军拆房时，商邱四关数千居民曾向匪军当局请愿，但毫无人性的蒋匪竟用机枪扫射，驱散请愿民众。一八一旅于去年十一月五日逃窜前，即将该城三百余户居民的货物、被服、牲口、家具劫掠一空，受灾人民，流浪街头，乞食为生。该城于去年十一月六日解放后，人民纷纷向解放军控诉匪军暴行，要求全部歼灭该匪军为他们复仇。民主政府除将城内所有碉堡拆除，砖头木料归原主重建房舍外，并对灾民进行适当救济。
    【新华社淮海前线十三日电】前线记者报导杜聿明匪军在解放军强大攻击下，最后覆没时的情景称：经过三天激战，九日黄昏，各路总攻的解放军指向杜匪“剿总”总部及匪第二兵团司令部驻地的陈官庄一线。解放军攻到那里，乱成一团的战士指定他们一个放枪的地方后，各式枪支立刻就堆了起来。俘虏群如象泛滥的潮水一样，一看望不到边的由解放军押着向东走去。当记者问起：你们是那一部分？他们立即报出了各种的番号，有的则回答：提不得啦！我们一个一部分。这些长久陷在饥饿里的敌军士兵们，偶而发现地上有一块解放军掉下的干粮，立刻就有一群人拥上去，以至厮打起来。几百辆缴获的汽车，在杜聿明临时筑的机场上由解放军战士押着，忙碌的搬运物资。从陈官庄至鲁集一线，到处停放着敌军士兵们用降落伞撑起用以挡风雪的棚子。巨大口径的榴弹炮、美式山炮和各种枪支弹药，夹杂在才缴获的坦克与装甲之间堆集如山。前来“空投”的蒋机还在匆忙的抛下罐头、饼干和弹药。一个身背十二支步枪的战士俏皮地说：“不要丢啦，我已经拿不了啦。”
    【新华社中原十三日电】淮海战役胜利结束，中原大敌已除，人民解放军进攻的矛头，即将指向长江以南国民党统治地区。加紧进行渡江的准备工作，成为中原军民当前的重大任务。中共中原中央局与人民解放军中原军区各直属机关，特于元旦祝捷大会上，在干部中着重进行准备过江的思想动员，同时号召大家放手大胆而又深入细致地发动和教育广大人民，使他们清楚地认识：过江是为了彻底打垮国民党反动统治，驱逐美帝国主义的侵略势力，为全国人民亦即为中原人民求得永远的解放与和平的生活。中原得地利之便，中原军民应首先担负起这个光荣的任务。并指出过江与过江以后可能遇到一些新的困难，但只要事前在思想上、组织上有了充分准备，就不难加以克服。我们去年南下以来，曾克服了很多困难，相信今后也一定能征服任何困难。中原局宣传部长刘子久同志强调指出：“我们要坚决地把伟大的人民解放战争进行到底，将长期在国民党反动统治下的全国人民解放出来。”中原军区参谋长李达同志号召干部准备过江，要加强组织上的统一，建立正规的制度和作风，坚决执行党的各种政策，反对无纪律无政府状态，争取全国胜利早日实现。大会并分电中央毛主席、朱总司令及淮海前线将士们致敬致贺。前电称：我们在一九四九年，誓以新的战争姿态，完成党中央给我们的新任务。后电称：在淮海前线伟大胜利的有利基础上，将进一步发动后方人民支援前线，消灭中原残留之敌，并做好一切进军江南的准备工作。
