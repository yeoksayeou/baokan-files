　　Bandit Planes Bomb Langfang in a Cruel Attack
  　Further Arousing the Anger of the Broad Masses of People
    [Pingjin Frontline Dispatch] After the liberation of Langfang, the people began to live a free and happy life. However, on January 9th, at around 2 PM, two American-made planes of the evil Kuomintang flew in from the direction of Beiping, rapidly descending and dropping two bombs into the crowd who were gathering for the market. Five houses were burned down, and fifty-eight people were tragically killed or wounded by the bombs (thirty dead, eight seriously wounded). The scene of blood and flesh scattered everywhere was too horrible to bear. The family members of the victims cried loudly while holding the corpses. Comrades from the Health Department of a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army ran from three or four *li* away and, together with our troops from the 10th Sub-district, rescued the injured amidst the smoke, immediately bandaging them and sending them to the hospital. Comrade Xu Ying of the District Committee personally led the masses in fighting the fire and rescuing the injured. Doctors from the railway hospital also rushed to provide medical assistance. The people were deeply moved by the Liberation Army's courageous and active rescue efforts. The broad masses of the townspeople were filled with bitter hatred for the Kuomintang air force's cruel bombing of peaceful residents. Currently, the People's Government is expressing condolences to the families of the victims and preparing to provide relief as appropriate.

　　匪机惨炸廊房
  　更激起广大人民愤怒
    【平津前线电】廊房解放后，人民开始过着自由快乐的生活；但万恶的国民党的两架美造飞机，于一月九日下午二时许，由北平方向飞来，急速低飞，向正在赶集的人丛中投弹两枚，烧毁房屋五间，惨遭炸弹杀伤的五十八名（亡三十名、重伤八名），血肉遍地惨不忍睹，被难家属抱尸大哭。东北人民解放军某部卫生部同志们，由三、四里外跑步赶来，同我十分区部队，在烟务弥漫中抢救受伤者，当即予以绑扎，送到医院。地委徐英同志亦亲自领导群众救火，抢救受伤者，铁路医院的医生也赶来救护。人民对解放军这样奋勇积极的救护工作，大受感动。该镇广大群众对国民党空军残酷轰炸和平居民，无不切齿痛恨。现在人民政府，正向受难家属进行慰问，准备酌情予以赈济。
