Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, January 8th: War criminal Du Yuming, when fleeing from Xuzhou, forcibly conscripted over ten thousand teachers and students from primary and secondary schools in Xuzhou and other areas into the army, driving them to the front lines to fight. In recent days, a large number of teachers and students have been rescued by the People's Liberation Army. They accuse Du's bandits of the bloody crime of harming young students, stating: On December 1st of last year, when Du's bandits withdrew from Xuzhou, they gathered over ten thousand teachers and students from more than twenty primary and secondary schools, including Xuzhou Middle School, Tongshan Middle School, Xuzhou Normal School, and Xinxin Middle School, as well as more than ten schools forcibly relocated to Xuzhou from Haizhou and other places by the Kuomintang bandit army, and escorted them westward from Xuzhou. Sun Xiping and Liu Ziping, students from Haizhou Middle School rescued by the People's Liberation Army from the encirclement, said: "We, the students of Xinhai, have suffered two major disasters. The last time we were forced by the 44th Army stationed in Haizhou to the west of the Grand Canal. During the crossing, due to crowding, no fewer than a hundred people were shot and killed by them (referring to the Jiang bandits) and fell into the water. We who survived managed to reach Xuzhou with great difficulty. Who knew that in Xuzhou we couldn't even get food. Haizhou Middle School alone had more than three hundred male and female students wandering the streets begging for food, in extremely miserable conditions. This time, we were again forced to flee west, and were forced to join the army as soldiers. On the road, each student had to carry four mortar shells and a large backpack, and would be beaten if they fell behind. After they were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, they ordered the students to dig trenches and build barricades in front. They were not allowed to hide when shells fell. If they rested even for a moment, they would be beaten with shovels and sticks. Many students have already died on the front lines." According to Cheng Qingfang, a senior high school student from Tongshan Middle School, Ma Bangzhen, a junior high school student from Tongshan Middle School, Wang Yu, a junior high school student from Xuzhou Middle School, Shan Weijun, a sixth-grade student from Xuzhou Middle School Attached Elementary School, Zhang Shouxian, a fourth-grade student, and Jin Guangren, a physical education teacher from Xinan Town Chamber of Commerce Elementary School, who were rescued by the People's Liberation Army on the 9th of last month: "On December 1st, more than 1,500 male students and more than 500 female students from Tongshan Middle School were escorted to the army by more than 200 police officers with live ammunition. Inside the encirclement, they (referring to the Jiang bandits) occupied villages and civilian houses, driving the students into the wild. Before we were rescued by you, we had been hungry for four whole days. Once, some extremely hungry students went to grab the food dropped by the planes and were shot dead by them. This time, more than 30 of us students ran out, and they opened fire on us with machine guns." Zhu Shizhu and eight other students from Haizhou Middle School who escaped from Lishilin, Nanmazhuang, and other places on the 26th of this month, stated: Due to heavy casualties, Du's bandits ordered all male students to replenish the troops as cannon fodder. Zhu and the other eight were assigned to the 1st Company, 2nd Platoon, 485th Regiment, 162nd Division of the 44th Army as soldiers (Note: The 44th Army was completely annihilated in the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign; this is Du's bandit attempt to rebuild). Zhao Xiuqing, a sophomore student, only sixteen years old, was also assigned to the fifth squad to carry ammunition boxes. Li Yongzhao, a student from Haizhou Normal School, was shot and killed by the company commander of Du's bandits' 3rd Company for refusing to dig fortifications. They also said: After the male students were assigned to the troops, Du's bandits kept the female students in senior organs, raping them and forcing them to serve as nurses. According to Sun Wantang, a third-year student from Haizhou Middle School: Zhong Zhaoqi, a female student in his grade, was gang-raped by the director of the newsroom of the 458th Regiment and his secret agents. Sun Wantang also said: After the male students were assigned to the company, all their watches, pens, money, and belongings were confiscated by Du's bandits. They were subjected to abuse by the veteran soldiers, living an inhuman life. The veteran soldiers hid in bunkers to keep warm, ordering the students to stand guard and collect firewood in the snow. Sixteen-year-old student Liu Maoshu wore only a single layer of clothing and stood three shifts on guard in the snow. The next day, his legs were frozen and he could not stand up. The teachers and students of various schools now rescued by the People's Liberation Army have received warm consolation and preferential treatment from the People's Liberation Army.

　　战犯杜聿明血腥罪行
  　强编学生入伍送死女生惨遭敌军轮奸
    【新华社淮海前线八日电】战犯杜聿明自徐州逃窜时将徐州等地中小学校师生万余人，强迫编入军队，驱上前线作战，连日来已有大批师生被解放军营救出来。他们控诉杜匪残害青年学生的血腥罪行称：去年十二月一日杜匪于撤离徐州时，即将徐州中学、铜山中学、徐州师范、昕昕中学等二十余中小学校及由海州等地被国民党匪军强迫迁至徐州之十余校师生共万余人集中一起，由徐州押解西行。从围歼圈内被解放军救出的海州中学学生孙西平、刘子平说：“我们新海学生遭了二次大难。上次被驻海州的四十四军押到运河以西，过河时因拥挤，被他们（指蒋匪）用机枪打死落水的不下百余人。我们活着的好容易摸到了徐州。那知在徐州饭也吃不到，仅海州中学就有三百多男女学生流落街头沿门乞食、状极凄惨。这次我们又被押着西逃，并强迫我们学生补入部队当兵。路上每个同学要挑四颗迫击炮弹和一个大背包，掉了队就遭毒打。他们被解放军包围后，就叫学生在前面挖交通沟，拉鹿砦做工事，炮弹打来不准躲。稍一休息，他们就用洋锹、棍子来打。很多同学已在前线死亡了。”据上月九日被解放军救出之铜山中学高一学生程庆芳、初二学生马邦榛、徐州中学初一学生王玉、徐中附小六年级学生单维俊、四年级学生张守贤及新安镇商会小学体育教师靳广仁六人说：“十二月一日，铜山中学一千五百余男生，五百余女生，被二百多荷枪实弹的警察押到军队里。在包围圈内他们（指蒋匪）占住村庄民房，把学生驱到野地里。我们在被你们救出以前，已饿了整整四天，有一次有些饿极了的同学去抢飞机丢下的粮食，被他们用枪打死了四个。我们这次卅多个学生向外跑，他们就用机枪向我们扫射。”本月二十六日由李石林南马庄等地逃出的海州中学学生朱时铸等八人称：杜匪因伤亡惨重，于是下令将所有男学生补充部队当炮灰，朱等八人即被补入四四军一六二师四八五团一连二排当兵（按：四四军已在淮海战役第一阶段全部被歼，此系杜匪企图重建）。二年级学生赵秀卿才十六岁，也被编在五班扛子弹箱。海州师范学生李永照因不肯挖工事，被杜匪三连连长枪杀。他们又说：当男学生被编入部队后，杜匪即将女生留在高级机关，实行强奸并强迫她们充当看护。据海州中学三年级学生孙万堂说：与他同级的女生仲兆琪就被四五八团新闻室主任及其谍探员轮奸。孙万堂又说：男生补充到连里后，所有手表、钢笔、钱物，全被杜匪没收。他们受到老兵的虐待，过着非人的生活。老兵们躲在地堡里烤火，叫学生到雪地里去站岗、拾柴火。十六岁的学生刘茂书穿了条单裤，在雪地里一连站了三班哨岗，第二天两腿冻僵了，站不起来。现被解放军救出的各校师生，均受到解放军的热情慰问与优待。
