(Jinan News) The current working policy of Yuan Dynasty is to mobilize the masses for production, complete democratic party consolidation and political construction, and combine this with resolving remaining land issues. However, the county originally only issued calls and arrangements for production, lacking in-depth inspection and specific leadership, which led to the stagnation of production in some villages. After discovering this, the county leadership conducted a thorough top-down inspection and began organizing a mass production movement centered on party members. However, the general public still had doubts about our party's policies: some middle peasants were still afraid of struggle, and some poor peasants believed that the government would not let anyone starve to death in the future, so there was no need to work hard for production. In order to get through to all levels of thought, the county committee first educated cadres with examples: for example, Jian Tian Zhuang Village in the Seventh District had only twenty mu of land available for adjustment, the landlord in Da Wang Zhai had only six mu of extra land, and the wealthy peasant and landlord in Xi Zhang Ba had only sixty mu of extra land for thirty households, indicating that relying solely on struggle could not meet the needs of the masses. After the cadres, the masses were mobilized to study policies, so that the masses realized that all party policies are for the purpose of developing production, rewarding labor, and calling for getting rich. It was explained that the feudal system in this county had been completely eliminated and that there would be no more struggles in the future. This improved the production enthusiasm of the masses. More specific education of the masses involved criticizing the lazy and encouraging production during the distribution of fruits. Han Zongyang from Bei An Tou in the Seventh District was a lazy person, and the masses did not allocate land to him, forcing him to admit his mistakes in front of everyone and state his future attitude before the masses allocated land to him. Hua Zhuang divided ten large vats to those who grind flour, and added three more water mills to the original nine. Xi Zhang Ba sorted out silver ingots to buy twenty more cattle to distribute, which satisfied the masses greatly. Some party branches that had not led the masses in production in the past also conducted inspections this time. Some party members found in their inspections that they not only did not lead production, but they were not active in their own production either. After the inspections, party members began to lead the masses to actively produce, some smashing their quail on the spot and carrying manure baskets the next day to actively collect manure. Some set their own production plans and led the masses to make similar production plans. As a result, the Yuan Dynasty's production gradually achieved results: According to a statistic from one district in the Fourth District, from the beginning of the ancient lunar October to November 10, 549 head of livestock, 521 pigs, 14 carts, 36 wheelbarrows, 10 plows, 71 harrows, 83 hoes, 2 oil mills, 1 flour mill, 6 cotton flails, 3 steamed bread places, and 5 rolling mills were added; 41 manure pits and 84 pig pens were added; 20,000 cartloads of fertilizer were accumulated; and 2,200 households engaged in sideline occupations, with a total profit of more than 46 million Jichaos.

　　元朝深入领导生产四区积肥二万大车
    【冀南讯】元朝当前工作方针是发动群众生产，完成民主整党建政，结合解决土地遗留问题。但该县原来对生产是只有号召、布置、缺乏深入的检查及具体的领导，致使部分村庄生产停滞。县领导上发现后，即进行了从上而下的彻底检查，开始以党员为核心，组织群众性的生产运动，但一般群众对我党的政策还有怀疑：有些中农还怕斗争，一部分贫农认为今后政府不让饿死人，不必努力生产。为打通各阶层思想，县委先以实例教育了干部：如七区柬田庄一村只有二十亩地可资调剂，大王寨地主只多六亩地，西丈八三十户地富只多六十亩地，说明光靠斗争不能满足群众要求。经过干部，又发动群众研究政策，使群众认识到一切党的政策均是为了发展生产，奖励劳动，号召发家致富。说明本县封建制度已经澈底消灭，以后再不斗争啦。这样提高了群众的生产情绪。对群众更具体的教育，是在分果实中注意了批评懒汉，鼓励生产。七区北安头韩宗阳是懒汉，群众不分给他地，迫其在大家面前承认了错误，表明了今后的态度，群众才分给他土地。化庄将十个大缸都分给磨粉的，原有九个水磨又添了三个。西丈八整出银子锞，准备买二十头牛再分下去，群众都很满意。有些党的支部过去没有带领群众生产，这次也作了检查。有的党员检查出自己不但不领导生产，而且自己生产也不积极。经过检查，党员都开始领导群众积极生产，有的当场摔死鹌鹑，次日背着粪筐积极的拾粪去。有的自己定了生产计划，并带领群众也同样的作出了生产计划。这样，元朝的生产逐渐获得了成绩：据四区一个区统计，从古历十月初到十一月十日，增添牲口五百四十九头，增猪五百二十一头，大车十四辆，小车三十六辆，犁十张，耙七十一张，镢头八十三个，油坊二座，粉房一座，弹花弓六个，蒸馍三处，轧车五个，增加粪坑四十一个，猪圈八十四个，积肥二万大车，搞副业的二千二百户，共得利四千六百多万元冀钞。　　（文汇、杰辰、尹萍、张荣）
