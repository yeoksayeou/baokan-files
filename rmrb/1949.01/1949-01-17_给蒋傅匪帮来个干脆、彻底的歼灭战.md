　　Give the Chiang-Fu Bandit Gang a Decisive and Thorough歼灭战

　　To all the commanders and fighters of the Northeast People's Liberation Army: We, the teachers and students of our school, extend our warm greetings to you for celebrating your great victory in liberating Northeast China and winning the great encirclement of Peiping, Tientsin, and Zhangjiakou.

　　Comrades! You have truly responded to Chairman Mao's call and, under the command of the wise and capable General Lin Biao, broken through the enemy's layers of defense, defeated the elite mechanized units of the Chiang bandit gang, liberated all the large and small cities in Northeast China, and rescued the vast number of compatriots in Northeast China.

　　Comrades! Your courage has awed the entire Northeast. No matter how much the American imperialists aid them, no matter how much the Chiang bandits clamor, the Northeast has finally been completely liberated by you.

　　Recently, after seeing newspaper reports, we learned that you have crossed the Shanhaiguan Pass and joined forces with the brotherly People's Liberation Army in Peiping-Tientsin and North China. Furthermore, you have cut off the communication points and transportation lines of the Chiang-Fu bandit gang, causing the bandit gang to be trapped in isolated cities, shrinking back and daring not to move. The military-civilian pact regulations you have promulgated after entering the city have further stirred the hearts of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas and caused the soldiers to be weary of war, all preparing to welcome you to liberate them.

　　Comrades: You are fighting to relieve the suffering of us North China people and to fight for true democracy and true freedom. To all the commanders and fighters! We hope you will take care of your health and give the Chiang-Fu bandits a decisive and thorough歼灭战 to promote the early arrival of national liberation.

　　给蒋傅匪帮来个干脆、彻底的歼灭战
    东北人民解放军全体将士同志们：庆祝你们解放大东北的伟大胜利后，又赢得了平、津、张家口等的大包围。我校师生特向你们致以热烈的慰问。
    同志们！你们真的响应了毛主席的号召，又在精明善战林彪将军的指挥下：冲破了敌人的层层防御。击溃了蒋匪帮的精锐机械化部队，解放了全东北的各大小城市，拯救了全东北的广大同胞。
    同志们！你们的勇气，威镇了全东北，任凭美帝怎样援助，蒋匪怎样叫嚣，东北终于被你们全部解放了。
    最近看见报纸的报导，晓得你们已经跨过山海关，又在平津和华北兄弟解放军会师了。并且切断了蒋傅匪帮的联络点及交通线，使匪帮困守孤城，畏缩不敢动。你们又颁布了进城后的军民约法规章，更是使蒋区民心沸腾，兵心厌战，都在准备欢迎你们解放他们哩。
    同志们：你们为我们华北老百姓解除痛苦而战斗，为争取真民主，真自由而战斗。全体将士同志们！望你们要保重身体，为上给蒋傅匪来个干脆、彻底的歼灭战，以促使全国解放的早日到来。
