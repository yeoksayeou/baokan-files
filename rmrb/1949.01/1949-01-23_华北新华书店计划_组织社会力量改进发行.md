　　North China Xinhua Bookstore Plans
  　Organize Social Forces to Improve Distribution
    [Our Newspaper] In the past six months, readers from various regions have frequently written to inquire about textbooks: Why is it that textbooks are not available long after the school term has started, and some have had to buy them three or four times without success? This reporter saw groups of primary school students gathered outside the Xinhua Bookstore in central Hebei, shouting, "Why don't you sell us books?" In view of these situations and regarding the distribution of textbooks for this spring semester, this reporter visited the responsible comrade of the North China Xinhua Bookstore. The information obtained from the inquiry is recorded below:
    From April to December of last year, the North China Xinhua Bookstore printed a total of 1.7 million copies of elementary and higher primary school textbooks (not including those printed by bookstores in various districts). According to the responsible comrade of the bookstore, the bookstore attaches importance to the distribution of primary school textbooks ideologically. According to the scope of supply divided by the bookstore, it can generally meet the needs. Various branches and sub-branches have also made every effort to distribute textbooks and have adopted different methods: contacting education sections, participating in teachers' conferences, organizing consignment points and vendors. Many comrades took books to the countryside to visit schools, organized temporary branches at market fairs, or actively adjusted books between stores. However, due to blindness in the work, such as not understanding the different characteristics of mountainous and plain areas, some primary schools in mountainous areas often require climbing several large mountains to reach, and most vendors are unwilling to go. Secondly, the differences between urban and rural areas are not understood. Urban areas are more formalized, while rural areas, due to farming time and the hardship of farmers' lives, have different school systems, such as full-day, half-day, morning, and evening classes. Therefore, the progress of courses varies, and single and double volumes are often bought throughout the year. In addition, in some new districts, various textbooks from the Anti-Japanese War era and different textbooks from various liberated areas coexist (such as four types in central Shanxi). Therefore, although some schools do not have all the books, other textbooks cannot be distributed. Because the above different situations have not been well grasped, and it is not clear when is the peak sales period, it has caused some places to have a shortage of textbooks, students cannot buy books, while some places have a lot of inventory that cannot be well adjusted. Until now, the bookstore still has 400,000 copies of textbooks in stock.
    The above is the general situation of textbook distribution in the past year. Regarding how to do it in the future, according to the comrade, the organization of the distribution network should be based on the principle of "organizing social forces." It is impossible to imagine that one's own strength can be used to universally penetrate every county and every village. The power of society is great, and they can accomplish this task, but we must recognize their characteristics and functions, and organize them appropriately to play their role.
    In urban areas: schools are generally more formalized, so textbook distribution is during the school opening seasons in spring and autumn, August and February. Textbook distribution is also relatively smooth. In general small cities, only consignment points are needed. Medium-sized cities generally have branches that can directly contact schools. In addition to setting up branches in large cities, more consignment points should also be set up.
    In rural areas: because the conditions are not as good as in urban areas, especially in mountainous areas, the conditions are even worse than in plain areas. The following methods will be adopted in the distribution to send textbooks to schools scattered throughout the area. First, support the civil-run and government-assisted consignment points in each county. The organizational form of the cultural cooperatives in the Taihang area should be promoted. They are professional, mass-based, and cultural organizations, and are a good form of organization for rural distribution. Second, organize vendors through consignment points in each county to go deep into the schools in each village. This can be widely adopted in the plains. Third, in mountainous areas where vendors cannot reach, prepare to adopt the method of consignment points and county education sections jointly organizing complete primary schools or central primary schools to sell on consignment. Or, during the textbook distribution period, select a few appropriate locations to set up temporary distribution points. Fourth, in some areas, the post office can be used for consignment sales.
    Finally, the responsible comrade of the Xinhua Bookstore earnestly expressed the hope that the educational administrative leading organs and various cultural and educational organizations, and people from all walks of life will provide assistance in various ways to textbook distribution, and provide opinions and criticisms at any time to help improve distribution work.

### 华北新华书店计划　组织社会力量改进发行

　　华北新华书店计划
  　组织社会力量改进发行
    【本报讯】近半年来，各地读者关于教科书曾纷纷来信问：为什么开学了好久时候还买不到教科书，有的赶着买了三次四次也买不到。记者曾在冀中新华书店见到小学生成群集于门外，高呼“为什么不卖给我们书”？记者鉴于这些情形并关于今年春季教科书发行问题。走访华北新华书店负责同志，兹将探询所得，分志于下：
    从去年四月到十二月华北新华书店共印初小高小课本一百七十万册（各区书店未计在内），据该店负责同志说，关于小学课本的发行，书店在思想上是重视的。按该店划分所应供给的范围说，大体上是可以满足的，各分店支店也都尽力进行了课本发行，并分别采用不同的办法：与教育科接洽，参加教员会，组织代销处和小贩，很多同志都带书下乡串学，赶集组织临时支店，或在各店间主动调剂书籍等。但由于在工作中存在着盲目性，如不了解山地与平原的不同的特点，山地有的小学往往须要爬几座大山才能到达，一般小贩多不愿去。其次，对城市与乡村的不同点也不了解，城市较正规化，而乡村因农作时间与农民生活苦等原因，学校的制度不可能一样，有全日制、半日制、早晨制、晚上制等，因此课程进度参差不齐，双册单册常年有买的。此外有的新区，抗战以来的各种课本，各解放区的不同课本都并列存在（如晋中就有四种），所以有的学校虽然书不全，别的课本也发行不进去了。由于对以上不同的情形，没有能很好的掌握，摸不清什么时候是大量销售时期，以致造成某些地方课本脱节，学生买不到书，而有些地方则积压很多，未能很好调剂，直到现在，书店尚积存课本四十万册。
    以上是过去一年中课本发行的大致情形。关于今后将如何办，据该同志谈：发行网的组织，应以“组织社会力量”的原则为出发点。不能设想单独用自己的力量普遍深入到每个县每个乡村里去。而社会的力量是很大的，它们可以完成这个任务，但我们要认识他们的特点与作用，予以适当的组织才能发挥作用。
    在城市方面：学校一般都比较正规，故课本发行都在春秋两季开学时期，八月和二月，课本发行也比较顺利，在一般小城市只设代售处就可以，中等城市一般有分店，可以直接与各学校进行联系，大城市则除设分店外，还应多设代售处。
    在乡村方面：因其条件没有城市好，尤其山地比平原条件还坏，在发行上将采取以下几种方法，以便把课本送到分散各地的学校中去。第一、扶植各县民办公助的代售处，太行区的文化合作社的组织形式应推广，他们是职业性的、群众性的、文化性的组织，是农村发行的很好的一种组织形式。第二、经过各县的代售处，组织小贩深入到每个乡村的学校中去，这在平原地区可以普遍采用。第三、在小贩足迹到不了的山地，准备采取代售处与县教育科共同组织完小或中心小学代售。或在课本发行时期，选择几个适当地点设临时分销处。第四、在有些地区可以利用邮局代售。
    最后，该新华书店负责同志殷切的表示，希望教育行政领导机关及各文教团体，各界人士对课本发行多方予以协助，并随时提出意见和批评，以帮助改进发行工作。
