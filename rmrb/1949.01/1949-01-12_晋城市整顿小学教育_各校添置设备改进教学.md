Taiyue Telegram: Jincheng City has achieved preliminary results in its cultural and educational construction work. Before the war, Jincheng was the cultural and educational center of Ze Prefecture, with two middle schools, three higher vocational schools, and eighteen public and private primary schools, totaling more than 5,000 students. After being devastated by the Japanese invaders, they were completely shut down and replaced with enslavement education. After liberation, with the support of the democratic government, it has gradually recovered, but due to a lack of leadership and planning, simple school equipment, and teachers casually skipping classes, the number of out-of-school children still accounts for more than 40% of school-age children. Since the North China Education Conference, Jincheng City has attached importance to education and started to rectify schools. Based on the principle that urban education should be concentrated rather than dispersed, and the number of school-age children and the distance from their residences, the city's primary schools have been adjusted and merged into eleven schools. The past method of setting up schools according to streets, preventing students from this street from entering schools on other streets, has been changed so that students can freely choose schools to attend. At the same time, the combined teaching method was changed to a single teaching method. The previous time, various specific systems and methods for the standardization of education were discussed to strengthen administrative management and business research, and to focus on complete primary schools and combined schools to create experience and promote the general. School construction work is carried out with emphasis. Last winter, 154 shi of millet were used to strengthen school construction. Now each school has the necessary equipment, and classes are divided according to the curriculum. Complete primary schools can carry out single-grade teaching, and general schools can also carry out graded teaching. Teachers of combined teaching can also focus on their work and implement various systems. All teachers can implement the leave system, and there is no phenomenon of leaving school casually as in the past, and they personally participate in various construction activities in their spare time. Due to the gradual increase in the number of students in schools after the schools were standardized, the city's three-year complete primary schools and eleven primary schools had 1,001 male and female students before the rectification, and now there are 1,179 students, accounting for 64% of the city's school-age children, and it is still increasing. In particular, the number of complete primary schools has increased from 310 to 425. Now, because the classrooms cannot accommodate them, it is necessary to temporarily stop enrolling new students. The city's "People's Park" and "Public Sports Field" are also under planning.

　　晋城市整顿小学教育
  　各校添置设备改进教学
    【太岳电】晋城市文化教育建设工作，已获得初步成绩。晋城在战前为泽州府文化教育中心，当时曾有两个中学，三个高校，公私小学十八座，共学生五千多人。后经日寇百般摧残，完全停办，并以奴化教育代替。解放后经民主政府扶植，已逐渐恢复，但因缺乏领导、缺乏计划，学校设备简陋，教员随便旷课，所以失学儿童仍占学龄儿童百分之四十多。自华北教育会议以后，晋城市即重视教育工作，着手整顿学校，根据城市教育宜集中不宜分散的原则，及学龄儿童多少与住地远近，将全市初小学调整合并为十一所，并改变了过去按街分设学校、防止本街学生入他街学校的办法，使学生能随意选择学校入学；同时改复式教学为单式教学。前次又讨论出教育正规化的各种具体制度与办法，以加强行政管理与业务研究，并以完小与合校为重点，创造经验，推动一般；有重点的进行学校建设工作。去冬已用小米一百五十四石来加强学校建设，现各校已有必要的设备，按照课程分班分级上课，完小可进行单级教学，一般学校也可分级进行。复式教学教员，亦能安心业务，对各种制度都能执行。各教员均能执行了请假制度，已无过去随便离校的现象，并在课余亲自参加各种建设。由于学校正规化后学校学生逐渐增加，全市三年完校，十一所初校，在整顿前有男女学生一千零一人，现已有一千一百七十九人，占全市学龄儿童的百分之六十四，而且还在继续增加，尤其是完校由三百一十名已增加到四百二十五名，现因教室容纳不下，不得不暂时停止招收新生，本市的“人民公园”、“公共运动场”等亦在计划建设中。
