　　Strengthening the Inspection System
  　A Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang Improves Product Quality
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, a yarn factory in Shijiazhuang actively dismantled and cleaned its machinery, improved the use of raw materials, and strengthened its inspection system, thereby improving product quality. After the preparations for war, the factory's machinery was dismantled and reinstalled. Moreover, the long-used and poor-quality machine oil produced a gummy substance, hindering the operation of the machinery and motors. Furthermore, due to a lack of raw cotton, they had to mix in some lower-grade cotton, which led to a slight decrease in the quality of the products from late November to early December. After this phenomenon was discovered, the factory immediately took appropriate measures, such as changing the composition of the cotton mix, using less lower-grade cotton, dismantling, cleaning, and leveling the machines to reduce malfunctions, reducing the "doffer" speed of the carding machines to increase the combing effect, strengthening the inspection of the implementation of standard operating procedures in all parts, and inspecting the winding of yarn. With the efforts of workers' production competitions, the quality in the past half-month has not only returned to its original state but has also exceeded the level before the war preparations. According to the results of laboratory tests, the number of broken seeds attached to the fine yarn produced in the second half of December decreased by 38% compared to November, and the unevenness of the yarn (excessively thin parts) decreased by 19%. As a result, the yarn is even, clean in color, and has reached the standard degree, with the strength increasing by 14%. Regarding the yarn ball winding aspect, the winding workers' skills have gradually become more proficient, and the shortcomings have been greatly reduced compared to before. Major errors have been reduced by 25%, and there are very few instances of short lengths per strand.

　　加强检查制度
  　石市某纱厂提高产品质量
    【本报讯】石市某纱厂近日积极拆洗机器，改进原料使用，加强检查制度，提高了产品质量。备战后，该工厂机器经过拆动，重新装置，且用久了的品质不良的机器油发生胶质，障碍了机器及马达的运转，并因原棉缺乏，曾不得不掺用一些成色较次的棉花等，致使十一月下旬至十二月上旬之间的出品质量略有降低。当这一现象被发现后，厂方立即采取了一些适当措施，如改变配花成分，少用次棉，拆洗及轮平机器以减少故障，减低梳棉机的“道夫”速度，以增加分梳作用，加强各部分实施标准工作法的检查和对于摇纱的检查，再经工人生产竞赛的努力，半月来之品质，不但恢复了原状，而且超过了备战前的水平。根据试验室检查结果，十二月下半月所出细纱较之十一月份在破籽的附着数上减少了百分之三十八，条干不匀（过细处）减少了百分之十九，因之细纱之条干匀净、色泽洁白已达标准程度，强力增加百分之十四，在摇纱纱团方面，摇纱养护工的手艺已渐熟悉，缺点亦较前大减，大错已减少百分之二十五，每小缕短少根数的事情已很少了。
