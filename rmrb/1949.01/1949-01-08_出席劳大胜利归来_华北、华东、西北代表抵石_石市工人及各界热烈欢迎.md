　　Returning Victoriously from the Labor Congress:
  　Representatives from North, East, and Northwest China Arrive in Shijiazhuang
    Workers and People from All Walks of Life in Shijiazhuang Extend a Warm Welcome
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang News] Following the conclusion of the Sixth National Labor Congress, representatives from the Northwest, East, and North China regions, whom workers in various regions eagerly awaited, have returned to Shijiazhuang. Accompanying them were representatives from democratic labor unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and representatives who attended the Warsaw International Youth Congress. Among them were the nationally renowned labor hero Zhao Zhankui and the East China's shooting hero Comrade Wei Laiguo. The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Shijiazhuang City Federation of Trade Unions, and people from all sectors of the Party, government, military, and civilians successively held grand welcome rallies and symposiums. On the evening of December 27th, committee members of trade unions from factories in Shijiazhuang City, as well as representatives from institutions and schools, attended a grand gathering at the Democracy Theater. Comrade Li Zaiwen, Executive Committee Member of the Labor Congress and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, first expressed his excitement and extended a warm welcome and regards to representatives from various regions on behalf of the workers in North China. He earnestly hoped that the representatives would introduce valuable experiences and materials from the labor movement and implement the spirit of the Labor Congress. Comrade Liu Xiufeng, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, spoke, explaining that the convening of the Labor Congress was a victory of the Chinese working class's more than twenty years of heroic struggle. He emphasized that Party members and cadres should serve the workers well, learn from the workers, and rely on the workers to build an industrial China. He also hoped that the representatives would educate and enlighten Party members and cadres, strengthen proletarian consciousness, and integrate with the workers. Amid warm applause, Comrade Zhang Fulin, the head of the East China delegation, was invited to speak. He said with great excitement: "The Labor Congress is a congress of unity and victory, which has solved many problems of the past twenty years. It is a great victory for the Chinese proletariat, and also a victory for the world proletariat. This would not have been possible without the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao." The spirit of internationalism overflowed from his words. Then, Comrade Fulin described the warm welcome received by people along the way in the Northeast and the situation of visiting many large cities in the nine northeastern provinces. He said: "Workers have rebuilt the Northeast from piles of scrap metal and created countless labor heroes. Everywhere there are large-scale factories. The Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant, which ranks fourth in the world, was secretly sabotaged by Chiang bandit troops when they fled, but the workers cleverly protected it. Without saying how important the machine was, when the enemy only threw a few grenades, the workers shouted, "Run! The water is coming up!" and tricked the enemy away. After liberation, it was quickly restored! The industrial construction of the Northeast has given us great confidence." At this time, the audience burst into applause. Finally, he proposed: "Under the leadership of our proletarian party, as long as we learn humbly and unite the workers, staff, and all working people in the newly liberated areas, victory will come soon." Then, the ×× representative told about the heroic struggle of hundreds of thousands of workers in Shanghai who united to resist the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in various ways. He said: "Regardless of the Chiang bandits' slaughter, arrest, and torture, the workers were determined and did not tell a single truth. A teenage female worker was brutally beaten and had her fingernails torn off by the enemy, but she endured the torture and did not utter a single word!" He finally said forcefully: "When the resolutions of the Labor Congress are passed on, the workers will work harder. With the enthusiastic assistance of the workers in the liberated areas, especially with the powerful strength of the People's Liberation Army, we are full of greater confidence! The slogan of defeating Chiang Kai-shek will soon become a reality, and we will advance victoriously under the banner of Chairman Mao!" The audience immediately shouted the slogan "Workers of the whole country unite to support the struggle of worker brothers in Chiang-controlled areas." Comrade Qiu Ru, a youth representative attending the Warsaw Conference, gave a vivid report, in which he introduced in detail the great influence of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the liberated areas internationally. He said: Representatives from 54 countries expressed their high esteem for Comrade Stalin and Chairman Mao. During the parade, the representatives and the people of Warsaw shouted at the raised portraits: "Long live Stalin! Long live Mao Zedong!" As soon as his portrait was raised, groups of reporters scrambled to take pictures. The three thousand Chairman Mao badges and dozens of sets of Selected Works of Mao Zedong that we brought were snatched up. Representatives from various countries praised the Chinese revolutionary struggle as having great significance for the world and expressed their infinite concern for the Chinese revolution, especially representatives from Southeast Asian countries who enthusiastically expressed their willingness to work together with us to strive for liberation"! His report was constantly interrupted by thunderous applause from the audience. Finally, he introduced the magnificent construction and the high degree of awareness of the people he saw in the Soviet Union. He said: "Everywhere shows a high degree of organization and discipline. At the same time, Soviet workers, women, and children have a very good spirit of learning, have a lot of knowledge, and know about the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, expressing great concern." The reports of the representatives caused infinite excitement among the people present. Finally, amid thunderous cheers, the labor hero, the banner of Chinese workers—Comrade Zhao Zhankui—stood high on the stage and met everyone. The huge sound of "Develop production competition, learn from labor heroes" overwhelmed everything. After the meeting, a Peking opera was performed to add to the fun.
