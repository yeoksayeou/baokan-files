[Eastern Hebei Electric Dispatch] After the Northeast People's Liberation Army entered the customs to fight, women in various parts of eastern Hebei offered condolences, helped with sewing and washing, and donated a large number of consolation items to enthusiastically support the front lines. In the first district of Ninghe, a consolation station was organized along the highway, and women and children from various villages went to the station every day to console the wounded soldiers. Many women organized sewing, dismantling, washing, and consolation organizations; they visited the troops from house to house during their stay, and proactively asked for work. Zhang Shuying, a female cadre in Niwo Village, the eleventh district of Baodi, led the women of the entire village to help the troops carry water and cook. Wang Qing, the director of the women's association in Yangzhuangzi, the fourteenth district of Yutian, led the women of the entire village to grind the sorghum rice of the troops into flour, and made vegetable buns for them to improve their lives. Xu Zhuangzi in the tenth district of Ninghe, set out a pledge to ensure that the troops would not go hungry or cold when they came, and that the wounded would suffer less pain. Various places wrote letters of condolences to General Lin Biao and the Field Army. The women's federation of the Lunan Directly Subordinate District proposed to the front-line soldiers in their letter of condolence: ensure that they actively produce in the rear to support the front, and strengthen the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. The Fourteenth Military Sub-district Women's Federation also sent a telegram to warmly console the front-line People's Liberation Army and the wounded and sick soldiers. A wave of enthusiasm for comforting the army has been set off everywhere. The villages in the Chengguan District of Yutian County donated 152 towels, 145 pairs of socks, and 17,076,000 yuan of border currency; the masses in the second district of Baodi County donated 1,226 sets of towels and soap. Ding Hefeng of Zhenggezhuang donated the soap that had been at the bottom of her trunk for four years since she got married. An old lady in Laojutang in the second district of Yutian said: "I can't repair roads or carry stretchers, so I'll give these three chicks to the troops to cook as a consolation!" In the second district of Linyu County alone, 6,030 catties of pork were donated to the army. The 60 employees of the Tongsheng Factory in the Fifteenth Special District also gave the People's Liberation Army 1,500 catties of millet, which was the surplus of their food expenses, as a consolation. The 23 villages in the sixth district of Leting County sent 324 consolation bags, tobacco pouches, pen covers, socks, stockings, towels, soap, yellow smoke, toothbrushes, toothpaste, tooth powder and other items, and 13,148,500 yuan of border currency.
