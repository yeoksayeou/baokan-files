　　Hoping that Jingxing Cadres
  　Organize the Masses for Cooperative Production to Solve the Difficulty of Selling Thread Retail
    In the People's Daily of December 24th, there was an article about the requests of the masses in Dongjiao and other thirteen villages, hoping that the Jingxing and Huolu county governments would lead the opening and repairing of canals to increase paddy fields. I think this suggestion is very necessary. However, limiting it to solving the canal opening problem seems insufficient. Because in the work in these places, there are still some more common and serious problems, which is a lack of attention to leading production. I think this problem should be given more attention by the Jingxing County leadership.
    In Beixijiao Village, Jingxing Second District, no one led this year's winter production. Although some people are now engaged in transportation, such as transporting coal, it is not widespread. Every day, there are many people sitting on the streets and in front of restaurants, and many animals are also idle. It is said that this autumn, district cadres came to reorganize mutual aid and labor exchange organizations, but because no one led, it was just a name and did not actually play a role. I asked a cadre about this, and he said, "Our village is different from other villages; everyone is from a suffering background (meaning there were no landlords before), and production doesn't need leadership." I also asked: Has the higher level not arranged for production leadership? Or does the village not pay attention to it? He said, "The district has not arranged it, and after autumn, the main focus is on autumn grain requisition and expanding the army."
    There is also a cooperative in this village, but it is nominal. It has not done any activities in the past year. The reason is that the person in charge of the cooperative is afraid of delaying work, and the village cadres do not care. Everyone produces in their own homes, and no one cares about the cooperative's affairs. Maybe some of this is because the cooperative cadres' treatment issues have not been resolved, but the main problem is probably that the higher-ups have abandoned leadership. Take spinning thread as an example. In the slack season, this is a major part of women's production, but it requires the leadership of the cooperative: many women spin thread that they cannot sell, and they always have to take it piecemeal to Nanxijiao market or Pingshan City to sell or exchange. Leaving aside whether they sell at a fair price or not, just the manpower alone is a waste. On the 9th, in the Nanxijiao market alone, I saw forty-six or seven women crowded together arguing about selling thread. An old woman from Beixijiao asked me when I would go to Pingshan so that she could go with her child to sell a pound of thread. From this, it can be seen that as long as the cooperative takes on the responsibility of consignment sales, the village's textile industry will definitely be better.
    Engaging in sideline production in winter is an urgent demand of the masses, but the leadership has not paid enough attention to these issues, only simply completing the central tasks and forgetting to regularly lead the masses in various productions. These days, the village cadres have gone to the district office for meetings, reportedly to arrange for the conclusion of the land reform work, but production must be well led while carrying out this work (rectifying cooperatives, etc.), otherwise, the conclusion of the land reform work will not be done well either. It is hoped that the county leadership will strengthen the education of cadres on leading production and regularly check the production work in various places.　　　　　(Wei Liang)

### 希望井陉干部组织群众合作生产解决零星卖线困难

　　希望井陉干部
  　组织群众合作生产解决零星卖线困难
    十二月二十四日的人民日报上登了篇关于东焦等十三村群众要求，希望井陉、获鹿县政府领导开修河渠，增加水田，我觉得这建议是十分需要的。不过，仅限于解决开渠问题，还显得不够。因为这些地方的工作中，还存在一些更普遍与严重的问题，就是对领导生产不注意。我觉得这问题更应引起井陉县领导上的重视。
    井陉二区北西焦村，今年的冬季生产就无人领导。现在虽有一部分群众搞运输运炭等，但不普遍。每天街上和饭铺的门前有不少坐街的人，还有好多牲口也闲着。据说今年秋天区干部曾来重新组织过互助、变工等组织，但因无人领导，也是光有个名，实际没有起作用。我为这事，也问过一个干部，他说：“俺这村和别个村不一样，都是受苦出身（意思是以前没有地主），生产用不着领导。”我又问：领导生产是上级就没布置呢？还是村中没有重视呢？他说：“区上也没有布置过，秋后主要搞秋征，扩军。”
    这村也有合作社，但是有名无实，去年一年就未做过什么活动，原因是合作社的负责人怕误工，村干也不管，各人在各家生产，合作社的事就无人管了。这里也许有些是合作社干部待遇问题没有解决，但主要的问题恐怕是上边放弃领导。就拿纺线做例吧，农闲时候，这是妇女生产主要的一项，但这是需要合作社来领导的：许多妇女纺下线无法卖，总得零星拿到南西焦集上或平山城去卖或换。这里先不说卖上合适价格不，就单说人力，也不知浪费多少，九号这天，单南西焦集上，我就见有四十六七个妇女围在一起争吵着卖线。北西焦一个老太太曾问我几时到平山，好和他小孩相跟去卖一斤线。从这里可以看出，只要合作社负起代销的责任来，这村的纺织一定会更好些。
    冬天搞副业生产，是群众迫切的要求，但领导上并没有十分注意这些问题，只是单纯的完成中心工作任务，忘记了经常领导群众各种生产。这几天村干都到区署开会去了，听说是布置结束土改工作，但必须在进行这一工作时，很好的把生产领导起来（整顿合作社等），否则，结束土改工作也是搞不好的。希望县领导上加强对干部领导生产的教育，经常的检查各地生产工作。　　　　　（维亮）
