　　Experiences of Intellectuals in the Qingyuan Training New District
　　The Qingyuan County Committee of the Second Sub-district of Jinzhong, from September 26th to October 16th, held a training class for 148 intellectuals and primary school teachers. These intellectuals had little understanding of the revolutionary situation and the policies of our party, and had many ideological problems. The motivation for attending the training was mostly to "find a job" or "find food." The main questions they wanted to understand were: "Will Taiyuan be captured?" "Are Communism and the Three Principles of the People the same?" "Can the Communist Party defeat Chiang Kai-shek?" "What will the Communist Party do if the United States sends troops?" "Will a third world war break out?" "How are landlords and rich peasants distinguished?" "When will land be distributed equally? Will teachers get a share?" "Will those who worked for Yan Xishan be treated leniently now, and will they still be treated leniently in the future?" "Will people with problems be dismissed after training?" "What are the new educational aims, content, and methods?" After being trained, they wanted to be teachers in their local villages, not cadres, and wanted to be paid monthly salaries. In terms of learning methods, they wanted to learn by topic, not attend large lectures.
　　Based on these requirements, the training class decided to study current events, policies, and professional skills. The first three days were devoted to studying current events, including the international situation and the domestic situation. On the domestic situation: it was explained from the perspectives of military affairs, politics, economy, culture, and the comparison of the lives of the people in the liberated areas and the KMT-controlled areas, using concrete examples to illustrate the growing strength of our party, our army, and the people, and the inevitable collapse and destruction of the Chiang and Yan bandits. On international issues: the focus was on introducing the facts of Soviet workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals building a socialist society, adhering to a peaceful foreign policy, assisting oppressed nations, and assisting our country in jointly defeating the Japanese invaders, exposing the conspiracies of US imperialism to invade China and aid Chiang, and explaining that the imperialist aggressive forces headed by the United States will inevitably be destroyed by the growing revolutionary forces of the people.
　　Seven days were spent studying policies, mainly explaining the nature of Chinese society, the tasks of the revolution, current major policies, and the history of our party's struggle. The differences between the Three Principles of the People and New Democracy and Communism, land policies and industrial and commercial policies, cultural policies, etc. In terms of professional study, practical education was given from the aspects of education policy, teaching methods, administrative management, and student activities; emphasis was placed on the integration of education and practice. Implement the unity of teaching, learning, and doing, promote democratic style, and cultivate students' initiative and autonomy.
　　After studying, the thinking of the trainees mostly changed. The previous perceptions of doubting the strength of our party and our army and believing that a third world war would break out soon were basically changed. Those who had previously concealed their participation in reactionary organizations, except for a few individuals who were deeply poisoned, mostly automatically declared and registered. Those who were previously afraid of becoming cadres now wanted to become cadres and actively volunteered to participate in work.
　　The following experiences were gained in the 21-day training: First, boldly promote democracy in life management and speaking, and organize them to manage themselves, so as to quickly eliminate the trainees' doubts and fears about our party and our army, stabilize their learning mood, and gradually resolve various incorrect ideas in democratic debates. Teacher Qiao Junxiu had been trained during the Japanese occupation and the rule of the Yan bandits before the War of Resistance Against Japan. After this training, he said: "None of the previous trainings were as enjoyable and free as this one, and I didn't learn as much." Second, the content and methods of study should be determined according to the level and requirements of the teachers, and attention should be paid to using practical materials as teaching materials. When determining the study plan and discussion topics, everyone should be mobilized to put forward opinions in advance, so that each trainee can raise their own questions. Everyone was very satisfied with this method. Third, use the proletarian ideology to criticize various erroneous ideologies, improve everyone's ideological understanding, correct old ideas such as blind loyalty and blind filial piety, and point out that it should be "loyalty to the people and filial piety to the people." Someone felt that "it is uncivilized to scold Chiang Kai-shek as a bastard." We immediately repeatedly and sincerely explained: "Tens of thousands of compatriots and revolutionary comrades were slaughtered and murdered by the Chiang bandits, and you didn't see it as uncivilized; the masses scolded Chiang Kai-shek as a bastard, and you feel it is uncivilized; this is because your standpoint is wrong!" Everyone felt that this kind of criticism could improve their ideological understanding and was of great help to themselves.
　　The teachers and intellectuals in the Jinzhong New District had suffered the brutal persecution of the Yan bandits in the past, and felt that their lives and careers were not guaranteed; after this training, they all felt that they had freedom, democracy, and a bright future. They now have a very urgent demand for new things and new knowledge, and they are also very active in learning. At the end of the study, most of the young people were willing to participate in revolutionary work. After review and identification, most of them have been assigned appropriate jobs and have begun to serve the people!

　　清源训练新区知识分子经验
    晋中二分区清源县委会，从九月二十六到十月十六的二十一天中，召开了一百四十八人的知识分子与小学教员训练班。这些知识分子对革命形势与我党政策很少了解，思想上有许多问题。受训动机大多数是“找职业”，“找饭吃”；他们主要希望了解的问题是：“太原打开打不开？”“共产主义与三民主义是否一样？”“共产党是否能打败蒋介石？”“美国如出兵，共产党怎么办？”“第三次世界大战是否能打起来？”“地主富农怎样分别？”“何时平分土地？给教员分不分？”“给阎锡山办过事的人，现在宽大，将来还宽大不宽大？”“有毛病的人，受过训后，是否要裁下去？”“新的教育宗旨、内容、方法是什么？”受过训后，他们要求在本地本村当教员，不愿当干部，按月发薪金。在学习方法上，要求按问题进行，不愿讲大课。
    根据这些要求训练班决定学习课程有时事、政策、业务三个主要内容。开头三天学习时事，包括国际现状，国内形势。在国内形势上：是从军事、政治、经济、文化以及解放区和蒋管区人民生活的对比，用具体实例说明我党我军及人民力量的日益壮大，蒋阎匪必然崩溃灭亡。在国际问题上：着重介绍苏联工农兵和知识分子建设社会主义社会，坚持和平外交，援助被压迫民族，援助我国共同打垮日寇的事实，揭发美帝侵华援蒋等阴谋罪行，说明以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力必将被日益发展壮大的人民革命力量所摧毁。
    政策学习七天，主要讲解中国社会性质，革命任务，目前主要政策，我党斗争历史。三民主义与新民主主义、共产主义的区别，土地政策与工商业政策，文化政策等。业务学习上，从教育方针教学方法，行政管理、学生活动等方面，给以实际教育；强调教育与实际结合。贯彻教学做合一，发扬民主作风，培养学生积极性与自动性。
    经过学习，学员的思想大都发生了变化。以前怀疑我党我军力量和相信很快会发生第三次世界大战的认识，有了基本的改变。以前隐瞒参加反动组织的，除受毒较深的个别分子外，大多数人都自动声明与登记。以前怕当干部的现在想当干部，自动积极报名参加工作。
    在二十一天的训练中，获得的几点经验是：一、在生活管理和学习发言上，大胆发扬民主，组织他们自己管理自己，这样能够很快消除学员对我党我军的疑惧，安定学习情绪，使各种不正确的观念，在民主争论中逐渐得到解决。教员乔俊秀在抗战前，日寇占领与阎匪统治时期，都曾受过训，这次受训后说：“那一次也没有象这次痛快自由，学习这样多的东西。”二、根据教员的水平和要求来决定学习内容和方法，注意用实际材料当课材。确定学习计划和讨论题目时，事先发动大家提意见，让每个受训者把自己的问题提出来。大家对这种办法非常满意。三、以无产阶级的思想观点来批判各种错误的思想观点，提高大家思想认识，纠正愚忠愚孝等旧意识，指明应该是“忠于人民大众，孝于人民大众。”有人感觉到：“骂蒋介石王八蛋不文明”，我们即反复诚恳地说明：“成千成万的同胞和革命同志叫蒋匪屠杀暗害了，你没有看到不文明；群众骂了一句蒋介石王八蛋，你就感觉不文明；这是立场观点错了！”大家都认为这样批评能提高自己的思想认识，对自己有很大帮助。
    晋中新区的教员和知识分子，过去遭受过阎匪的残暴迫害，感到生命职业没有保障；这次经过训练，都异口同声地感到有了自由民主和光明前途，他们现在对于新事物新知识的要求非常迫切，学习也很积极。结束学习时，多数青年，都愿意参加革命工作。经过审查和鉴定，大多数人都已分配适当工作开始为人民服务！（梅南根据清源县教员训练班工作总结报告整理）
