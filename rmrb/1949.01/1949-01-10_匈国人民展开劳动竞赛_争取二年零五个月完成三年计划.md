　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS, Budapest reports: The Hungarian working people are extensively launching a labor competition to complete the three-year plan in two years and five months, and have achieved amazing results. Hungary's industrial production in December has exceeded the plan by 6 percent, and exceeded the average monthly production in 1938 by 32 percent. The steel, iron, machine manufacturing, paper making, textile and other industries, as well as agricultural product processing industries have achieved considerable results. In December, coal production reached a record high, exceeding December of last year by 20 percent. The production of the tractor industry in the same month was twice that of December 1947.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS, Budapest reports: In the movement to strive for the early completion of the national economic three-year plan, the Hungarian working people are achieving unprecedented new accomplishments. Due to the continuous increase in labor productivity, and the systematic exceeding of plans and reduction of production costs in many factories, the Hungarian economy has been greatly consolidated. The nationalization of factories employing more than 100 workers, implemented in 1948, has greatly increased the state's income. Many factories that did not generate profits for the state before nationalization have begun to hand over profits to the state. The victories achieved by Hungarian industry have led to a dramatic increase in national economic investment. Due to the increase in industrial profits, Hungary decided to invest 4.3 billion Hungarian Forints in the national economy in 1949. In this way, the total investment in two years and five months will reach 8.3 billion Hungarian Forints, while the three-year investment stipulated in the three-year plan is only 6.6 billion Hungarian Forints. According to the plan, industrial production in 1949 will increase by 28 percent compared to the pre-war level, and by 40 percent compared to the first year of the three-year plan.

　　(Note: According to the Hungarian industrial nationalization decree of March 25, 1948, the nationalization of factories employing more than 100 workers accounted for one-half of the total number of industrial enterprises in the country at that time. In May of the same year, the products of nationalized factories accounted for 90 percent of the country's total industrial output.)

　　匈国人民展开劳动竞赛
  　争取二年零五个月完成三年计划
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民正在广泛地展开在二年又五个月中完成三年计划的劳动竞赛，并已获得惊人的成绩。匈牙利十二月份的工业生产，已超出计划百分之六，并超过一九三八年每月平均生产量的百分之卅二。钢、铁、机器制造、造纸、纺织等工业以及农产品加工工业已获得相当可观的成绩。在十二月份，煤的产量已达最高纪录，比去年十二月超过百分之二十。同一月份的拖拉机工业生产，为一九四七年十二月份的两倍。
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：在争取先期完成国民经济三年计划的运动中，匈牙利劳动人民，正取得空前的新成就。由于劳动生产率的不断增加，以及许多工厂有系统地超过计划和减低生产成本的结果，业已大大巩固了匈牙利经济。一九四八年实行的雇用一百名以上工人的工厂的国有化，已大大地增加了国家的收入。国有化之前并未给国家生产利润的许多工厂，已开始以利润交给国家。匈牙利工业所取得的胜利，使国民经济的投资为之剧增。由于工业利润的增加，一九四九年匈牙利决定在国民经济中投资四十三亿匈币。这样，在两年又五个月中，投资总额将达八十三亿匈币，而三年计划中所规定的三年投资仅为六十六亿匈币。依据计划，一九四九年工业生产将较战前水平增加百分之二十八，较三年计划中第一年的水平增加百分之四十。
    （按：根据一九四八年三月二十五日匈牙利工业国有化法令，雇用一百名以上工人工厂收归国有者，占当时全国工业企业总数的二分之一。同年五月，国有化工厂的产品已占全国工业总产量的百分之九十。）
