　　Welcoming the Situation of National Victory
  　Jinnan Cadres Prepare for the Southern Expedition
  　Wuan Holds Southern Expedition Mobilization Meeting
    [Jinnan Electric] Cadres throughout the Jinnan region are intensifying their work, obeying the Party's assignments, and preparing to go south at any time with practical actions to welcome the national victory. To establish close ties with the people of the new areas as soon as possible, district cadres in Jize County are asking comrades familiar with the South about local customs. Cadres heading south are entrusting their family affairs to village cadres or neighbors so that they can be dispatched at any time. At a general meeting of all village cadres in the Third District of Gucheng, a detailed explanation was given of the comments of the central leaders on the Chinese military situation. All the cadres present listened attentively and engaged in enthusiastic discussions. A cadre from Nanluzhuang said, "Before, we just talked about victory, and I wondered when it would happen. Now victory has truly arrived." Many cadres said, "This is really great! The Kuomintang reactionary regime is about to collapse, and we must step up our work." Many cadres in the First District of Linzhang expressed their attitude and determination to unconditionally obey the Party's assignments. Female cadres Lan Yuqin and Li Fengzhi each prepared a set of lined clothes, a set of single clothes, and four pairs of shoes, ready to be dispatched at any time. They said, "As long as the Party calls, even if it asks me to go to Yunnan or Guizhou, I have no objections." They also said that they would work hard and study the Party's policies well so as not to make mistakes when working in the new areas. After receiving instructions from the county committee to greatly promote and cultivate new cadres, the Third District immediately identified candidates and mobilized them separately. The designated village cadres were able to consciously put aside personal interests, and within just five days, all twenty-four scheduled village cadres had fully arrived to work in the district.
    [Our Newspaper] On January 5th, the Wuan County Committee convened a county-wide district cadre meeting to mobilize preparations for the Southern Expedition. Comrade Jia Huisheng, the county secretary, said, "The victory of the Chinese people is certain. The question is whether we dare to win. I wonder if everyone dares to win?" Everyone shouted in unison, "Dare to win!" After group discussions, everyone rushed to sign up and await the Party's assignments. For example, the entire group in the Fourth District signed up for the Southern Expedition together. Of the 304 people who attended the meeting, 260 signed up to prepare for the Southern Expedition. Comrade Shen Anyong from the Seventh District said: I didn't sign up last year because I only have one eye, and I was afraid that if I signed up, they wouldn't call me. This year, I saw a Jin-Cha-Ji cadre going south who, like me, only has one eye, so today I also want to sign up to go south. (Propaganda Department of the Wuan County Committee)

    【冀南电】冀南全区干部正以加紧工作，服从党的调动，随时准备南下的实际行动，迎接全国胜利。鸡泽县区干部为及早与新区人民建立密切联系，正向熟悉南方的同志打听该地风俗人情。南去干部纷纷将家事付托给村干或邻居，以便随时出动。故城三区全体村干大会上，详细讲解了中央负责人对中国军事形势的评论，在座干部莫不聚精会神，并展开热烈讨论。南鲁庄一干部说：“以前光说胜利，我想着还不知是什么时候的事哩，现在胜利可真正到了。”许多干部都说：这真痛快呀！国民党反动政权就快完蛋了，我们要加油的工作。临漳一区许多干部表明态度和决心：无条件的听从党的调动。女干部兰玉琴、李凤芝各自准备下一套夹衣、一套单衣、四双鞋子，准备随时出动。他们说：“只要党号召一声，叫我到云南、到贵州，我都没意见。”并且表示，要紧张工作，好好学习党的政策，以免到新区工作犯错误。三区接到县委会大量提拔培养新干部的指示后，当即确定人选，分头动员。被指定的村干部，都能自觉的摆脱个人利益，只五天功夫，预定的二十四名村干部已完全到区工作。
    【本报讯】武安县委在一月五号，召开了全县县区干部准备南征动员大会。县书贾慧生同志说：“中国人民胜利是肯定的，就是看咱们敢不敢胜利，不知咱们大家敢胜利不敢？”大家齐声呐喊：“敢胜利！”分组讨论后，大家都抢着报名，听候党的调动。如四区全组一齐报名南征，参加会的人数共三百零四人，有二百六十人报名准备南征。七区申安永同志谈：我去年就没报名，因我是一只眼，怕报上名不叫去，今年我看到晋察冀一个干部南下，和我一样，也是一只眼，所以今天我也要报名南下。（武安县委宣传部）
