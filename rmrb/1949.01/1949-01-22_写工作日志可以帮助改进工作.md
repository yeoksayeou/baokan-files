　　Writing Work Logs Can Help Improve Work

　　"The important thing is to be good at learning." Facing today's rapidly developing situation, only by strengthening our learning can we adapt to the needs of our current work and improve ourselves. However, due to our daily busy work and the limitations of our memory, in order to record our work experience for future reference and to improve our work, there is a need to write work logs!

　　When starting to keep a work log, some comrades (I was like this at first) felt that the work they did every day was very ordinary and not worth recording; some completely recorded what classes they took in the morning and what work they did in the afternoon, all the same, and the result was useless. I think the following points should be noted when writing a work log:

　　(1) Record special events. For example, after the start of school this time, I found that the number of students was small, their enthusiasm for learning was low, and their lives were undisciplined and lax. I immediately recorded all the phenomena in a comprehensive manner, then analyzed the causes, and then tried to solve the problems. This not only recorded experience, but also promoted my ability to think when encountering problems.

　　(2) Record work plans for inspection. I have never had a specific plan for teaching the national language. I would grab whatever I could when I lectured, and it didn't have much effect. After realizing this, I studied it based on my past experience, formulated a teaching process, and submitted it to the students for comments. After the modification, I recorded it in the work log. Later, after working for a period of time, I opened the log and saw that it had not yet been implemented. I felt ashamed in my heart, and naturally strengthened my sense of responsibility for the work.

　　(3) Record work reviews - Once I assigned homework to the students, but many people did not hand it in on time. After reviewing, I found that my leadership was not enough. So I strengthened the supervisory responsibility of the group leaders, and I often went to the classroom at noon to inspect, telling them how to allocate their time, and the result was very effective. Such work reviews should also be recorded.

　　These are some of the experiences I have gained in my exploration. I am writing them out for everyone's reference and please give your corrections.

　　写工作日志可以帮助改进工作
    “重要的问题在善于学习”，面临形势急遽发展的今天，只有加强学习，才能适应当前工作的需要，才能提高自己。但是由于我们每日业务的繁忙，加以记忆力的有限，为了把工作经验记录下来，以备日后的参考和改进工作之用。因此就有写工作日志的需要了！
    开始记工作日志时，有的同志（我起初也是这样子）觉得每天作的工作都很平凡，没有记述的价值；有的将每日上午上的什么课，下午做的什么工作，完全记下来，千篇一律，结果毫无用处。我以为写工作日志时应注意下列几点：
    （一）记下特殊的事件。如此次开学后，发现同学人数很少，学习情绪低落、生活散漫无纪律等，我马上就将各现象综合的记下来，然后分析发生的原因，再想法解决问题。这样不仅记下了经验，还促进了我遇事思考的能力。
    （二）记工作计划以备检查。我教国语向来无一定计划，讲时乱抓一把，收不到多大效果。自己感到这点后，根据以往的经验研究了一下，制定了一个教学过程，提出来让同学参加意见，修改后就记在工作日志上，后来工作了一个时期，翻开日志一看，查觉尚未实行，心中感到惭愧，自然加强对工作的责任心。
    （三）记工作检讨——有一次我曾经给学生布置了课外作业，但到期有许多人没交，经过检讨，发现自己领导上不够。于是加强小组长督促责任，自己中午经常到教室巡视，告诉他们怎样分配时间，结果收效很大。象这样的工作检讨，也应记下。
    这是我在摸索中得到的一些经验，写出来供大家参考并请指正。
