Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 18th: According to TASS, Paris, January 14th: The Executive Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué, putting forward demands such as increasing wages, stating: The tax measures recently adopted by the government and passed by the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives, the increase in rent, the reduction of working hours, the decree to cut wages, and the increase in the number of layoffs and unemployed in some industries, are the result of implementing policies that serve the interests of American imperialism, which has brought further poverty to the working class, while the big capitalists are stuffing their pockets with huge profits. The resolution passed by the committee insists on its previous demands: namely, revising wages, salaries, and pensions based on a minimum wage of 15,500 francs (which represents a 25 percent wage increase); completely revising the classification of civil servants and state employees; adopting an activity-based wage system to ensure the purchasing power of the working people; abolishing wage zones; collective agreements including free discussion of wage issues by workers and factory owners; and appropriate compensation for increased rent costs. The Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labor calls on all trade union organizations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor and all its members to inform everyone employed in various enterprises and institutions of these demands, to discuss these demands with everyone concerned, and to win their full support. The Executive Committee calls on all wage earners to launch a movement without delay, demanding that the parliament stop implementing the law increasing rent until the working people receive compensation.

　　法总工会发表公报
  　坚持增资要求
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：法国总工会执行委员会发表公报，提出增加工资等要求称：最近政府所采取并为参众两院多数所通过的征税措施、增加房租、减少工时、削减工资的法令，以及某些工业中解雇与失业人数的增长，是由于实行以美帝国主义的利益为依归的政策的结果，给工人阶级带来了进一步的贫困，而大资本家们却以巨大的利润塞满他们的腰包。该委员会通过的决议坚持其以前的要求：即以最低工资一万五千五百法郎（这表示增加工资百分之二十五）为基础改订工资、薪水与养老金；全部修改公务员与国家雇员的分类；采用活动工资制，以便保证劳动人民的购买力；取消工资区；工人与厂主一道自由讨论工资问题包括在内的集体协议；适当补偿房租增加的费用。总工会执行委员会号召参加总工会的一切工会组织及其一切会员使受雇于各企业与机关中的一切人都获知这些要求，与一切有关的人讨论这些要求，并赢得他们的充分支持。执委会号召一切工资劳动者毫不延缓地发起运动，要求议会在劳动人民获得补偿以前停止实行增加房租的法律。
