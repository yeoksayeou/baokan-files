Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: The official news agency of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, the Central News Agency, reported on the 19th that at 9:00 AM on the 19th, the Executive Yuan meeting extensively discussed the current situation and resolved as follows: "In order to comply with the wishes of the people of the whole country and seek the early realization of peace, the government solemnly expresses its willingness to immediately and unconditionally cease fire with the CCP, and each designate representatives to conduct peace talks." A spokesperson for the Chinese Communist Party stated: This resolution of the Nanjing Executive Yuan did not mention the statement of the Nanjing puppet president Chiang Kai-shek on January 1st suggesting peace negotiations, nor did it mention the statement of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party on January 14th suggesting peace negotiations. It did not indicate whether it supported or opposed either of these two suggestions, as if the KMT and the CCP had not put forward any suggestions on January 1st and January 14th. Instead, it put forward its own suggestion, which is completely incomprehensible. In reality, the Nanjing Executive Yuan not only completely ignored the CCP's suggestion of January 14th, but also directly overturned the suggestion of the puppet president Chiang Kai-shek on January 1st. In his suggestion on January 1st, Chiang Kai-shek said: "As long as the Communist Party has the sincerity for peace and can make a definite expression, the government will sincerely meet and be willing to discuss concrete methods to stop the war and restore peace." Nineteen days later, a part of the same government, namely the "Executive Yuan" of the Nanjing government, overturned the statement of the "President" of this government, not "sincerely meet and be willing to discuss concrete methods to stop the war and restore peace," but "immediately and unconditionally cease fire first, and then each designate representatives to conduct peace talks." We want to ask the gentlemen of the Nanjing "Executive Yuan", which of your suggestions is valid, or is your "President's" suggestion valid? Your "President" considers "stopping the war and restoring peace" as one thing, and declares that he will sincerely meet and be willing to discuss concrete methods to achieve this thing with the CCP; you, on the other hand, divide war and peace into two things, unwilling to send representatives to discuss the concrete methods of stopping the war with us, but fantasize about suggesting "immediately and unconditionally cease fire first," and then send representatives to "conduct peace talks." Which of your suggestions is right? Or is your "President's" suggestion right? We believe that the Nanjing puppet Executive Yuan has exceeded its authority, and it is not qualified to overturn the puppet president's suggestion and arbitrarily make its own new suggestion. We believe that this new suggestion of the Nanjing Executive Yuan is unreasonable. After fighting such a long, large, and cruel war, both sides should send people to discuss the basic conditions for peace and make a mutually agreed armistice agreement before the war can be stopped. Not only do the people have this hope, but many people on the Kuomintang side have also expressed this hope. If, according to the Nanjing Executive Yuan's unreasonable "resolution," it is unwilling to conduct peace negotiations without a ceasefire first, then where is the Kuomintang's sincerity for peace? The Nanjing Executive Yuan's "resolution" has been made, and there is no possibility of peace negotiations without a ceasefire first, and the door to peace is now closed. If negotiations are to be held, then this unreasonable "resolution" must be cancelled; one of the two must be chosen. If the Nanjing Executive Yuan is unwilling to cancel its own "resolution," it means that the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government has no sincerity in conducting peace negotiations with its opponent. People want to ask: If Nanjing is really sincere, why is it unwilling to discuss the specific conditions for peace? Isn't the conclusion that Nanjing's peace proposals are false already confirmed? The CCP spokesperson said: Nanjing is now in a state of anarchy. The puppet president has one suggestion, and the puppet Executive Yuan has another suggestion. Who are people supposed to deal with?

### 中国共产党发言人评南京伪行政院决议　证实南京和平建议全属虚伪

　　中国共产党发言人评南京伪行政院决议
  　证实南京和平建议全属虚伪
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】南京国民党反动政府的官方通讯社中央社十九日电称：十九日上午九时行政院会议广泛讨论时局，决议如下：“政府为遵从全国人民之愿望，蕲求和平之早日实现，特慎重表示，愿与中共双方立即先行无条件停战，并各指定代表进行和平商谈。”中国共产党发言人称：南京行政院的这个决议没有提到一月一日南京伪大总统蒋介石建议和平谈判的声明，也没有提到一月十四日中国共产党毛泽东主席建议和平谈判的声明，没有表示对于这两个建议究竟是拥护那一个，反对那一个，好象一月一日和一月十四日国共双方并没有提出过什么建议一样，却另外提出了自己的建议，这是完全令人不能理解的。在实际上，南京行政院不但完全忽视中共一月十四日的建议，而且直接推翻了伪大总统蒋介石一月一日的建议。蒋介石在其一月一日的建议中说：“只要共党一有和平的诚意，能作确切的表示，政府必开诚相见，愿与商讨停止战争，恢复和平的具体方法。”过了十九天，同一个政府的一部分机构，即南京政府的“行政院”，却推翻了这个政府的“大总统”的声明，不是“必开诚相见愿与商讨停止战争恢复和平的具体方法”，而是“立即先行无条件停战，并各指定代表进行和平商谈”了。我们要问南京“行政院”的先生们，究竟是你们的建议为有效呢，还是你们的“大总统”的建议为有效呢？你们的“大总统”把“停止战争恢复和平”认为是一件事，声明必定开诚相见愿与中共商讨实现这件事的具体方法；你们则将战争与和平分割为两件事，不愿意派出代表和我们商讨停止战争的具体方法，而却异想天开地建议“先行立即无条件停战”，然后再派代表“进行和平商谈”，究竟是你们的建议对呢？还是你们“大总统”的建议对呢？我们认为南京伪行政院是越出了自己的职权的，它没有资格推翻伪大总统的建议而擅自作出自己的新建议。我们认为南京行政院的这个新建议是没理由的，打了这么久这么大和这么残酷的战争，自应双方派人商讨和平的基本条件，并作出双方同意的停战协定，战争才能停得下来。不但人民有这种希望，就是国民党方面亦有不少人表示了这种希望。如果照南京行政院的毫无理由的“决议”，不先行停战就不愿意进行和平谈判，则国民党的和平诚意在什么地方呢？南京行政院的“决议”是做出来了，不先行停战就没有和平谈判的可能了，和平之门从此关死了，而如果要谈判，则只有取消这个毫无理由的“决议”，二者必居其一。如果南京行政院不愿意取消自己的“决议”，那就是表明南京国民党反动政府并无与其对方进行和平谈判的诚意。人们要问：南京方面果有诚意，为什么不愿意商讨和平的具体条件呢？南京的和平建议是虚伪的这样一个论断，难道不是已经证实了吗？中共发言人说：南京现在业已陷入无政府状态，伪大总统有一个建议，伪行政院又有一个建议，这叫人们和谁去打交道呢？
