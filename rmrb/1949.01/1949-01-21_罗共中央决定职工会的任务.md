　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th.  Eltong News Agency, Bucharest dispatch: The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party issued a resolution on the tasks of trade unions on the 10th, stating that since the main means of production now belong to the people and not to the capitalists, the tasks of the trade unions have fundamentally changed. The relationship between workers and state-owned factories is one of cooperation. Today, the main tasks of trade unions include: implementing economic plans, increasing labor productivity, which is still below pre-war levels, exposing malfeasance in administrative agencies, reallocating existing manpower, and implementing the socialist principle of "remuneration according to the quality of work." Modernized canteens and day nurseries will be established, and special measures will be adopted to improve workers' food supply.

　　The resolution calls for the inclusion of non-Party workers in the leadership organs of trade unions. The resolution points out that the main work of trade unions in rural areas should be in state-owned farms. The resolution puts forward the task of trade unions as active factors in the world democratic camp's struggle against imperialism. The resolution emphasizes the close friendship between Romanian workers and Soviet trade unions (whose experience is extremely valuable for building socialism).

　　罗共中央决定职工会的任务
    【新华社陕北十三日电】电通社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚工人党中央于十日发表关于职工会的任务的决议称：既然现在主要的生产手段属于人民而不属于资本家，职工会的任务便已根本改变。工人与国营工厂之间的关系是同心协力的关系。今天职工会的主要任务包括：执行经济计划，提高现仍低于战前水平的劳动生产率，检举行政机构中的渎职人员，重新分配现有人力，实行“按照工作的质量给予报酬”的社会主义原则。现代化的食堂与日间托儿所将行设立，特别措施将被采行以改善工人的食粮供应。
    决议号召吸收非党工人参加职工会领导机关。决议指出：职工会在农村中的主要工作，应该是在国营农场中。决议提出职工会在世界民主阵营反对帝国主义斗争中的作为积极因素的任务。决议强调罗马尼亚工人与苏联职工会（它的经验对于建设社会主义是极其宝贵的）的亲密友谊。
