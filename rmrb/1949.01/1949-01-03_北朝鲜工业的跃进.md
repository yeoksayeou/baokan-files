North Korea's Industrial Leap Forward

One of the most significant democratic reforms implemented by the North Korean People's Government to ensure the economic recovery of North Korea was the confiscation of industries, transportation, telecommunications, and banks originally belonging to Japanese monopoly capitalists and national traitors. The reform, implemented by the Provisional People's Committee on August 10, 1946, returned the major sectors of industry to the people, making it a source of strength for the people's democratic system and the continuous improvement of the people's living standards, providing the people with opportunities for planned economy and guaranteed rapid advancement of industry and transportation.

On the eve of surrender, the Japanese invaders, in addition to shutting down all industrial enterprises, also destroyed the blast furnaces of all steel enterprises and coal mining machines, flooded mines and mining fields with water, and blew up bridges, railway tracks, and about 80 percent of the train carriages. However, thanks to the people's zealous efforts and the positive measures taken by the People's Committee, by January 1947, 822 of the 1,034 state-owned enterprises had resumed operations. In the first half of 1948, the average monthly total output increased compared to the previous period. The steel industry increased by 173 percent, mining by 134 percent, coal by 160 percent, the chemical industry by 116 percent, and light industry by 174 percent. In some sectors, production had already exceeded pre-war levels. In 1947, the total industrial output of North Korea increased by almost two and a half times compared to 1946, and the average output of workers also increased by almost one and a half times. Since 1947, light industry has begun to over-fulfill its production plans. The market is increasingly filled with various manufactured goods of improved quality, and prices are gradually decreasing.

One of the main goals of the national economic plan is to make North Korea, which has always relied on Japan, economically self-sufficient and to develop new production directions necessary for an independent national economy. In the past year, North Korean industrial enterprises have produced 50 kinds of finished products that were originally entirely imported from Japan, such as steel rolling and non-ferrous metal equipment, metal cutting machines, and transformers. In 1948, North Korean industry undertook the more arduous task of increasing output and manufacturing more than 100 new products, including electric motors, capacitors, and agricultural machinery equipment. The achievements of the North Korean working people in completing the 1948 plan give confidence that they will be able to complete these tasks. (Excerpt from Moscow News, July 20, 1948)

### 北朝鲜工业的跃进

  　北朝鲜工业的跃进
    北朝鲜人民政府为了保证北朝鲜经济复兴而实行的最重大的民主改革之一，便是没收原属日本垄断资本家和民族叛徒的工业、运输业、电讯业和银行。临时人民委员会于一九四六年八月十日所实行的改革，把工业的各主要部门交还人民，使它成为人民民主制度和人民生活水准不断提高的力量的源泉，使人民有了计划经济和保证工业及运输业迅速迈进的机会。
    在投降前夕，日寇除了关闭了一切工业企业外，还破坏了所有钢铁企业的鼓风炉和挖煤机，用水淹了矿坑和矿田，炸毁了桥梁、路轨和百分之八十左右的火车车辆。但由于人民的狂热努力和人民委员会所采取的积极措施，到一九四七年一月时，一千零三十四家国有企业中，已有八百二十二家复业。一九四八年上半年，每月平均的总产量都比前一时期提高了。钢铁业提高了百分之一百七十三、矿业百分之一百三十四、煤业百分之一百六十、化学工业百分之一百十六、轻工业百分之一百七十四，在某些部门生产已超过了战前水平。一九四七年，整个北朝鲜的工业总产量，比一九四六年增加了几乎两倍半，同时，工人的平均产量，也提高了几乎一倍半。自从一九四七年起，轻工业已开始超过计划地生产。市场上日益充满着质量提高了的各种制造品，而物价也在逐步下降中。
    国民经济计划的主要目标之一，是使向来依靠日本的北朝鲜在经济上自立，并向独立的国民经济所必需的新的生产方向发展。过去一年中，北朝鲜的工业企业已产出五十种原先全靠日本输入的成品，如辗钢与非铁金属的装备、金属切割机、变压器等。一九四八年，北朝鲜的工业负起了提高产量、制造百余种以上的新产品，包括电动机、容电器和农业机械装备的更艰巨任务。北朝鲜劳动人民在完成一九四八年计划所已达到的成就，令人确信其将能完成这些任务。（摘自一九四八年七月二十日莫斯科新闻）
