Improving Employee Benefits
　　Yangquan City Sets Specific Measures

　　[Yangquan News] On December 23rd, the city held an expanded meeting on employee welfare to discuss the future measures for employee welfare work in the city. First, Li Kaixin, director of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and director of the Public Enterprise Employee Welfare Committee, reported on the situation of employee welfare work in the city's public enterprises in the past; the secretary of the Welfare Committee reported on the income and expenditure accounts of the welfare fund and cultural and educational expenses. Then, the meeting discussed the improvement measures for employee welfare in the city in the future. As a result, the opinions were unanimous. In terms of basic measures, it was decided to follow the second opinion of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on labor protection issues, that is: employee injuries, deaths, disabilities, illnesses, old age, and other issues shall be directly resolved by the factory (or mine) based on the specific provisions of the government and the factory's and mine's regulations and collective contracts (currently still in accordance with the draft regulations of the North China Federation of Industry and Commerce on employee welfare). The government and the trade union are responsible for inspection, supervision, and providing opinions. In addition, the factory and mine shall allocate an amount equivalent to 5/1000 of the total wages, and employees shall also pay 5/1000 of their wages to the Municipal Welfare Committee, which is responsible for handling employee maternity subsidies, family illness, injury, death, and disaster relief, and subsidies for families with excessive populations. This method can enable factories and mines to pay attention to safety and sanitation equipment, and actively reduce employee injuries, deaths, and illnesses. In terms of cultural and educational undertakings, it was decided that each factory should allocate 1.5% of the total wages to the trade union for handling. In addition to the public enterprises that must implement this method, private factories and coal kilns with more than 20 people must also implement it (cooperatively operated enterprises will be studied separately). In terms of leadership institutions, it was decided to expand the Employee Welfare Committee of Public Enterprises into the Yangquan City Employee Welfare Committee to lead the city's employee welfare work. Each factory and mine shall organize a welfare committee consisting of the factory director, branch secretary, or general branch secretary, and the trade union director. The trade union director shall also serve as the director of the welfare committee and be led by the Municipal Employee Welfare Committee.
　　The meeting also discussed the issues of the municipal hospital and ensuring the actual wages of workers. Regarding the hospital, a general decision was made: (1) The medical expenses for employees of various factories and mines shall be covered as before, and temporary workers injured on duty shall also be treated by the hospital. (2) To take care of the economic difficulties of employees, all miscellaneous expenses for employees' hospitalization shall no longer be paid by the employees themselves; the diet for patients shall be changed to several types such as four catties of rice and three catties of rice. (3) The municipal hospital shall establish close relationships with the relevant factories and mines, and hold a joint meeting once a month, where the hospital shall report the situation and listen to opinions.
　　Regarding how to ensure the actual wages of employees, everyone believed that the best way was for the state to establish supply stores, and distribute a certain amount of necessities according to the needs of employees through the cooperatives of various factories, so as to avoid the intermediate exploitation of speculators. The current method is still for the cooperatives of various factories and public-owned stores to work together to ensure that the prices of essential goods do not change in the short term after wages are paid.

　　改进职工福利
  　阳泉市定出具体办法
    【阳泉讯】十二月二十三日，本市召开有关职工福利事业的扩大会议，商讨今后全市职工福利工作的办法。首先由市总工会主任兼公营企业职工福利委员会主任李开信同志，报告过去本市公营企业职工福利工作的情形；福委会秘书报告福利基金与文教费的收支帐目。接着就讨论今后全市职工福利事业的改进办法。结果，意见一致。在基本办法方面，决定按照全国总工会关于劳动保护问题的第二个意见，就是说：职工伤亡、残废、疾病、老弱等问题，由厂方（或矿方）根据政府和本厂本矿的厂规与集体契约中的具体规定，直接负责解决（现仍按华北工商会关于职工福利事业草案规定）。政府和工会负责检查、督促、提意见。另外厂方和矿方，还要拨出相当于工资总数的千分之五的款项，职工也缴纳本人工资的千分之五，交市福利委员会，负责办理职工生育补助、家属疾病、伤亡、灾害的救济及家庭人口过多的部分的津贴等事情。这个办法能够使厂方矿方，注意安全卫生设备，从积极方面减少职工的伤亡、疾病。文化教育事业方面决定由各厂每月按工资总数拨出百分之一点五交工会办理。除公营企业一律要照这个办法实行外，二十人以上的私人工厂、煤窑也须这样实行（合作经营的企业，另作研究）。在领导机构方面，决定把公营企业职工福利委员会扩大，改为阳泉市职工福利委员会，领导全市职工福利工作。各厂各矿由厂长、支书、或总支书、工会主任三人组织福利委员会，工会主任兼主任，受市职工福利委员会领导。
    该会又讨论了市立医院和保证工人的实际工资等问题。关于医院，作了一个大致的决定：（一）各厂各矿职工看病的医药费，照前包治，临时职工因公负伤也由医院负责治疗。（二）照顾职工的经济困难，职工住院的一切杂费不再要职工本人出；病号伙食改成四斤米、三斤米等几种。（三）市立医院与各有关厂、矿建立密切关系，每月召开一次联席会，由医院报告情况，听取意见。
    关于如何保证职工实际工资问题，大家认为最好的办法是由国家设立供给商店，经过各厂合作社根据职工需要，配给一定数量的必需品，避免投机商人的中间剥削。目前的办法，仍由各厂合作社与公营商店共同努力设法，保证生活必需品在发工资后短期内不变动。
