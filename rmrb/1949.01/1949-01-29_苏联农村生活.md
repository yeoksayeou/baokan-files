　　Soviet Rural Life
    ▲ A recent editorial in Pravda wrote: Today, the life of Soviet collective farms is very remarkable. Urbanized villages have sprung up, with wide, straight streets lined with shops, pharmacies, cinemas, and stadiums. Many collective farms already have their own sanatoriums and music schools, and are starting to build parks. Many places are digging canal networks and establishing power stations, while in many other places, stadiums and cinemas are being built. Soviet farmers are working tirelessly to achieve a better communist future as soon as possible.
    ▲ The collectivized Soviet countryside has produced millions of experienced organizers, experts in cultivating land and raising livestock, who implement large-scale collective farming. These experts have quickly mastered the complex modern methods of agricultural production and agricultural science. They are the most valuable and decisive wealth accumulated by the Soviet countryside over many years of implementing the collective farm system. The Soviet farm system has brought farmers new occupations that they had never heard of before the revolution. Tractor, harvester, and combine drivers, electricians, radio technicians, architects, and amateur art teachers, these new rural occupations have emerged in response to the needs of socialist rural cultivation and daily life.
    ▲ Soviet collective farms now have hundreds of laboratories, which are promoting the achievements of Soviet scientists among the broad masses of farmers, such as pasture and crop rotation systems and seed germination methods. In the republics of Central Asia, these laboratories help collective farmers implement new methods of cotton ginning, which greatly increases production. In Siberia, these laboratories first experimented with various frost-resistant fruits and berries cultivated by the great Soviet botanist Michurin, and these laboratories are the founders of orchards in the northern regions of the Soviet Union. At the experimental farm of the collective farm in the Rovno region, the wheat varieties cultivated according to the methods of Lysenko, Michurin's successor, yield three times more than ordinary wheat varieties.

　　苏联农村生活
    ▲真理报最近的社论写道：今天，苏联集体农庄的生活是十分引人注目的。城市化的村庄已经耸起，有着宽广笔直的大街，两边排列着商店、药房、电影院和体育场。许多集体农场已有了自己的疗养院和音乐学校，并开始建筑公园。许多地方正在开凿运河网并建立发电站，另外许多地方，则正在建筑体育场和电影院。苏联农民正在不懈努力，争取早日实现更美好的共产主义。
    ▲集体化了的苏联农村已出现了几百万实行大规模集体耕作的有经验的组织者、耕种土地和饲养牲畜的专家。这些专家很快地掌握了很复杂的现代农业生产方法和农业科学。他们是苏联农村中多年来实行集体农场制度所积蓄起来的最宝贵的最有决定作用的财富。苏维埃农场制度带来了农民们在革命前从未听见过的各种新职业。拖拉机、收割机和联合收割机的驾驶员、电机师、无线电技师、建筑师和业余艺术教师等，这些新的农村职业，都在社会主义农村的耕种方面和日常生活方面的需要下，应运而生。
    ▲苏联集体农庄现有几百个实验室，正在广大农民群众中推广苏联科学家的成就，如牧草与作物轮种制和种子发芽法等进步的农作方法。在中亚细亚的各共和国，这些实验室帮助集体农民实行棉花打卡的新方法，大大地增加了产量。在西伯利亚，这些实验室首先实验苏联伟大植物学家米丘林所培植的各种抗霜水果和浆果，这些实验室是苏联北部地带种植果园的创始者。在罗夫州集体农场的实验农场里，按照米丘林的后继者李森科的方法，所培养出来的小麦品种，其产量比普通麦种增加三倍。
