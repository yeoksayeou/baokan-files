Song of the Female Textile Workers
    Fifteen-year-old worker Zhu Guifang
    A fine spinning frame, long and long,
    Four hundred spindles spinning busy,
    Three sisters come to tend the machine,
    Each one stronger than the other.

    The eldest sister is truly great,
    Fifteen yarn breaks joined in a minute;
    The second sister is really capable,
    Keeping the machine very clean;
    The youngest sister's skill is clever,
    She watches twenty roving bobbins well.

    The three sisters are truly competent,
    Eagerly striving to be model workers,
    No machines stopping, hands never idle,
    No lumpy yarn made on the machine.

    Eight sisters winding yarn,
    All wearing white aprons,
    When the team leader blows the winding whistle,
    All eight sisters arrive.

    The team leader quickly starts the machine,
    The sisters wind row by row,
    Only the sound of yarn tubes clattering,
    Falling down like lightning fast.

    Four hundred bobbins, four hundred tubes,
    Wound in just twenty seconds,
    The lever is pulled, the machine starts,
    All eight sisters thread the yarn.

    Mind quick, hands skillful,
    All threaded in less than half a minute,
    The sisters run to wind the yarn,
    Winding it into bags and going back to wind.

    The yarn winders are truly enthusiastic,
    Not resting after winding,
    Going back to the machines to join breaks,
    The tending sisters smile happily.

    A red flag is planted on the machine,
    The flag fluttering, truly beautiful,
    Everyone sees it with envy,
    Working harder to increase production.

    Being a model worker is truly glorious,
    Our names are published in the newspapers,
    Millions of people read the newspapers,
    Saying our production is good.

    Compete to be model workers, increase production,
    Increase production to support the front lines,
    Quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek,
    Workers across the country stand up,
    Build a New Democratic China,
    Everyone living happily in peace.

　　纱厂女工歌
    十五岁女工  朱桂芳
    一台细纱车长又长，
    四百个锭子转的忙，
    姐妹三人来看车，
    一个更比一个强。
　
    大姐姐真不错，
    一分钟接头十五个；
    二姐姐真是行，
    把车清洁的很干净；
    三妹妹手艺巧，
    二十个毛棍看的好。
　
    姐妹三个真能干，
    一心争取当模范，
    不跑车，手不闲，
    车上不把疙疸练。
　
    络纱的姐妹八个人，
    身上都束着白围裙，
    组长一吹络纱哨，
    八个姐妹都来到。
　
    组长急忙摇下车，
    姐妹们一排排络起来，
    只听纱管乒乓响，
    落得好象闪电快。
　
    四百个穗子四百个管，
    二十秒钟就络完，
    车把一搬开了车，
    八个姐妹都上线。
　
    心又灵来手又巧，
    不到半分钟都上好，
    姐妹们飞跑把纱倒，
    倒到口袋里又去络。
　
    络纱的，真积极，
    络完纱了不休息，
    又到车上去接头，
    看车的姐妹笑嘻嘻。
　
    红旗插在车头上，
    旗子飘飘真好看，
    大家看见了真眼气，
    努力加油把活干。
　
    当模范，真光荣，
    名字都在报上登，
    千万人儿都看报，
    都说我们生产好。
　
    争模范，多生产，
    多多生产支援前线，
    早早打垮将介石，
    全国工人把身翻，
    建设新民主主义新中国，
    大家美满的过太平年。
