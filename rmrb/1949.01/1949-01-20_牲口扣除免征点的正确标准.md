The Correct Standard for Deducting Exemption Points for Livestock

To the Comrades of the People's Daily:

Regarding the deduction of livestock exemption points, I have noticed discrepancies between the draft of the North China Agricultural Tax Provisional Regulations and your published answers regarding the autumn tax collection. The draft states that cattle and donkeys are deducted seven *dou*, and mules and horses are deducted one *shi*. However, you stated that cattle and donkeys are deducted four *dou*, and mules and horses are deducted seven *dou*. Which should I tell the masses?

I would also like to raise a question regarding the deduction of exemption points for population. You stated that half a point is deducted for those who eat at home for more than three months but less than six months, and one point is deducted for those who eat at home for more than six months. In this way, for example, if a person eats at home for four months and gets half an exemption point, and eats at someone else's home for eight months and gets one exemption point, wouldn't this be equivalent to deducting an extra half exemption point? I believe it should be calculated and deducted based on the actual time spent eating.

Also, some fruit trees are assessed for production at 60%, while others are assessed at 50%. Which is the correct percentage to use?

In addition, is income from sideline production during the winter agricultural slack season subject to tax? What is the minimum income threshold for taxation, or is it tax-exempt?

Guo Qiyuan, Finance and Food Department, Zanhuang, December 8th

Comrade Qiyuan:

1.  The original draft of the Agricultural Tax Provisional Regulations stipulated that the deduction for livestock consumption was 7 *shi dou* of grain per head of cattle and donkey, and 10 *shi dou* of grain per head of mule and horse. After further study, it was considered that households without livestock were at a significant disadvantage. Therefore, it was changed to 4 *shi dou* of grain per head of cattle and donkey, and 7 *shi dou* of grain per head of mule and horse. The explanation given to the masses should follow this revised regulation.

2.  You have raised an excellent point. The initial stipulation in the draft of the Agricultural Tax Provisional Regulations regarding the deduction of tax exemption points was based on the population regularly eating at home or regularly provided for by the family. Those who are less than three months old are not deducted, those who are more than three months but less than six months are deducted half a point, and those who are more than six months are deducted one point. After discussion and research, it was considered that this calculation was too cumbersome and did not meet the needs of the masses. At the same time, the problem you raised would be difficult to solve. Therefore, it was decided to uniformly deduct tax exemption points based on the actual population at the time of the annual survey or recalculation, removing the limitations of three months and six months. All regions should follow this approach in the future. However, population deductions should not be applied twice.

3.  The new agricultural tax regulations stipulate that fruit trees are taxed at 50% of the average annual expected yield, converted to grain based on the general market price during the main harvest and sales season in the local area. The original draft initially stipulated a calculation of 60%, but after research, it was changed to 50% to provide consideration. All regions should calculate based on 50%.

4.  Whether sideline occupations will be taxed is currently under study by the North China People's Government, and no unified regulations have been issued yet. Before the official announcement of the sideline occupation taxation method, sideline occupations are temporarily exempt from taxation.

### 牲口扣除免征点的正确标准

　　牲口扣除免征点的正确标准人民日报社同志：
    关于牲畜免征点的扣除，我见到华北农业税暂行税则草案和你们登载的关于秋征的解答有所出入，草案上是牛驴扣七斗，骡马扣一石，但你说的则是牛驴扣四斗，骡马扣七斗，到底给群众说哪一个？
    我再说一个扣人口免征点问题，你们说三个月以上六个月以下扣半个，六个月以上扣一个。这样，例如一个人一年在自己家吃了四个月，扣半个免征点。在别家吃了八个月，扣一个免征点。这样不是无形中多扣半个免征点吗？我意应按实吃时间计算扣除。
    又：果木树有的是按六成评产量计征，还有的是五成计征，不知按哪个对？
    另外，冬季农闲副业生产赚钱是否负担？起码数超过多少负担，或不负担？
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　赞皇财粮科郭起元　十二月八日起元同志：
    一、原拟农业税暂行税则草案规定，牲口扣除消耗，是牛驴每头七市斗谷，骡马每头十市斗谷。后经研究，认为无牲口户太吃亏，即改成牛驴每头四市斗谷，骡马每头七市斗谷。给群众解释，就应该依照改后的这个规定才对。
    二、你提的问题很好，农业税暂行税则草案起初规定免税点之扣除，依常年居家吃饭或由家庭常年供给之人口计算，不足三个月者不扣除，三个月以上六个月以下者扣除半个，六个月以上者扣除一个。后经讨论研究，认为这样计算太麻烦，不适合群众的要求。同时就象你所提的问题，就没法解决。因此，决定统以每年调查或改算时的实有人口为准扣除免税点，把三个月，六个月上下的限制去掉了。以后各地就应该照这样办。但不能两头顶人口扣除。
    三、农业新税则规定，果木树按常年平均应产量，依当地收获与出卖主要季节之一般市价折谷五成计征。原案起初规定是按六成计算，后经研究，为了照顾，改为五成。各地就应按五成计算才对。
    四、副业负担与否，现华府正在研究，尚未统一规定。在副业征税办法未正式公布之前，副业暂不负担。
