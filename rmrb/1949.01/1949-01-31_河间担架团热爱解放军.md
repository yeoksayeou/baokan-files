[Pingjin Frontline Electric] The Hejian Stretcher Team laborers at the front have demonstrated a high level of political and ideological awareness. While they were resting in Taohe Town, west of Tianjin, the People's Liberation Army arrived. Due to the large number of people and limited housing, the Hejian Stretcher Team laborers voluntarily and quickly combined shifts and vacated rooms. The ninth squad of the fourth company said, "Even if we have to sit up all night, we must let our comrades sleep on the kang (heated brick bed)." The entire team vacated fifteen rooms, allowing the Northeast People's Liberation Army to rest well. The laborers also heard that the troops had marched a hundred li without food or water, so they voluntarily used the firewood they had gathered from the fields to boil twenty-six pots of water for the soldiers to drink and wash their feet, and also helped with cooking. After the meal, they talked with the soldiers, introducing the preferential treatment of military families in the rear, as if they were meeting their own brothers. They further promoted the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, fetching water and sweeping the courtyard, with the whole class rushing to do it. An Fusheng got up before dawn to fetch water, filling the large water vat and even boiling a potful. An Huachun used his rest time to chop 180 jin of firewood for the landlord. Sun Xilian and Sun Zhenya proposed that the whole class knit covers for the landlord, and they made three pieces in one day. Liu Yuncai and his wife and children said, "These laborers are really strong!"

　　河间担架团热爱解放军
    【平津前线电】河间担架团民工在前线，表现了高度政治与思想觉悟。他们在津西淘河镇休整时，解放军开到这镇上来了，这一来人多房少，住不开，河间担架团的民工们就自动的急忙并班腾房，四连九班的民工说：“我们坐一夜也得叫同志们住在炕上。”全团一共腾十五间房，使东北解放军住好休息了。民工们又听说部队行军百里还没吃饭喝水，又自动用自己从地里拾来的柴烧了二十六锅开水给战士们喝水、洗脚，又帮助做饭。饭后和战士们在一起谈话，介绍后方优抗的情况，真和亲兄弟见了面一样。他们更发扬了解放军的光荣传统，挑水扫院子，全班抢着去干；安福生带着星星就起来挑水，挑满大瓮还挑一锅。安化春利用休息时间，给房东劈了一百八十斤木柴。孙喜连、孙振亚提倡全班给房东编盖子，一天就编成三块。刘云才和他的老婆孩子说：“人家这民工们真强呀！”
