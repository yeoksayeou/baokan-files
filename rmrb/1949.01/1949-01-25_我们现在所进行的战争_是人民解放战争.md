　　The War We Are Currently Waging Is a People's Liberation War
  　To the Editor:
    I very much agree with the addition of the "Study and Discussion" column on the fourth page of the December 8th issue, as it has given me much convenience in reading and learning. I now have several questions and terms that I do not understand, and I would like you to answer them for me:
    1.  Based on the current development of our war, is it a "Patriotic Self-Defense War," a "Democratic Self-Defense War," or a "War between Democracy and Anti-Democracy"?
    2.  How should the term "depreciation" be explained? Sincerely,
    Respectfully,

　　Xuguang, December 10th To the Editor:
    Please give a brief account of the war we are waging in order to help us understand the purpose of the Chiang bandit's seeking peace.
    　　Daming, December 22nd Comrades Xuguang and Daming: The answers to your questions are as follows:
    1.  The war we are currently waging is the "People's Liberation War."
    The Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war in July 1946. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party, for the sake of the people's democracy and freedom, led the people to rise up in resistance and launched the great Patriotic Self-Defense War. After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River in the second year of the war, our military situation underwent a fundamental change. That is, our military strategy has shifted from defense to offense. At the same time, in order to liberate a wider range of people, the war is being conducted from the liberated areas to the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The People's Liberation War has been winning victories one after another, and the Kuomintang reactionaries and their American masters have shown unprecedented panic. Now, in order to save their impending doom, they are plotting so-called "peace" schemes.
    However, all this will ultimately be in vain. The people have clearly realized that any "peace" trick by the reactionaries is just a shameful deception and cunning, the purpose of which is to try to gain a temporary respite in order to prepare for the continued enslavement and massacre of the people; and that true peace and true democracy can only be obtained if we make a final and greater effort to carry the revolution through to the end, completely annihilate the reactionary troops, destroy the reactionary political institutions, and drive imperialism out of China.
    2.  "Depreciation" is an economic term that refers to the wear and tear of fixed capital (machines, factories, equipment, etc.). Because fixed capital, unlike working capital (raw materials, wages, etc.), is not entirely transferred into commodities after one production, it must be converted and included in the calculation of production costs.

　　我们现在所进行的战争
  　是人民解放战争编辑同志：
    对于十二月八日第四版报上增设“学习讨论”栏，我很同意，它给了我阅读学习上许多方便。现在我有几个没有弄清楚的问题及名词，请你们给我解答：
    一、根据现在我们的战争发展情况来说是“爱国自卫战争”、“民主自卫战争”或是“民主与反民主的战争”呢？
    二、“折旧”一词该怎样解释？此致
    敬礼

　　旭光　十二月十日编辑同志：
    请把我们所进行的战争做一个简短的叙述，以便帮助我们了解蒋匪求和的目的。
    　　大名　十二月廿二日旭光，大名同志：关于你的问题，兹解答如下：
    一、我们现在所进行的战争是“人民解放战争”。
    国民党反动派在美帝国主义的支持下，一九四六年七月，发动了全国规模的反革命的内战。因此，中国共产党为了人民的民主与自由，领导人民起来反抗，举行了伟大的爱国自卫战争。在战争进入第二年，人民解放军渡过黄河以后，我们的军事情况便有了根本的改变。即在军事上我们的战略已由防御转为进攻。同时，为了解放更广大的人民，战争进行地区已由解放区而进行至国民党的统治区。人民解放战争节节胜利，国民党反动派及其美国主子，已呈现了空前的惶乱，到现在，他们为了挽救其即将到来的覆灭的命运，正策动着所谓“和平”的阴谋。
    然而，这一切，结果必全是徒然的。人民已经清楚地认识到：反动派任何“和平”的把戏，都只是可耻的欺骗与狡诈，其目的，即在于企图取得暂时的喘息，以准备对人民的继续奴役与虐杀；而真正的和平，真正的民主是只有我们以最后的更大努力，将革命进行到底，彻底歼灭反动派的军队，摧毁反动派的政治机构，驱逐帝国主义滚出中国，才能获得的。
    二、“折旧”是一个经济学上的名词，即为固定资本（机器、厂房、设备等）的损耗。因为固定资本并不如流动资本（原料、工资等）一样，在一次生产后便全部转入商品中，故在计算生产的成本时，须将它折算计进。
