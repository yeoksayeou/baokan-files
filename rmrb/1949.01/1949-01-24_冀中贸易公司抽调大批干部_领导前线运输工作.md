　　Leading Frontline Transportation Work
[Jizhong Electric] In order to vigorously support the Pingjin Front, the Jizhong Trading Company convened a meeting of managers from various general and branch stores, proposing that supporting the front is the primary task at present, and arranged for support-the-front transfer and transportation work. After the managers of the general and branch stores returned, they immediately extracted more than 100 cadres to support the front, directly participating in the frontline transfer and transportation work under the unified command of the logistics, ensuring the supply of non-staple foods to the front. In order to facilitate transshipment, three non-staple food stations were set up. The first batch of 1,055,115 catties of white oil, more than 680,000 catties of edible salt, and 220,000 catties of dried powder were transported to the front. The second batch of 1.25 million catties of white oil is being continuously transported. In order to develop economic work in the new district, combined with supporting the front, stabilizing prices, and opening up the local currency position, the company specially sent Comrade Liu Ji, director of the Research Office, to participate in the war zone economic group. In addition, more than 120 cadres were transferred to set up six battlefield stores in Wangqingtuo area in southern Pingjin to solve the food and lodging difficulties of transportation vehicles and stabilize prices. Also, in Hejian, Renqiu, Xinzhen and other major transportation routes, coarse food restaurants were established in conjunction with the local people, which greatly facilitated the passing troops and civilians.
