  　National Youth Congress to be Held on May Fourth
    Please Expedite Dispatch of Representatives to Jointly Organize Preparatory Committee
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th] The Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas of China, in order to unite the democratic youth of the whole country and jointly strive for the complete victory of the People's Liberation War and the New Democratic Revolution, proposes to convene a National Youth Congress in May this year. The Executive Committee of the Federation met on the 10th of this month. The Executive Committee members attending the meeting included Feng Wenbin, Qiao Mu, Huang Hua, Lu Ping, Xu Shiping, Yang Disheng, Chen Jiakang, Luo Qiong, Yang Zejiang, Zhang Fan, and others, totaling seventeen people. The meeting resolved: (1) To propose to youth organizations and young people from all walks of life across the country to convene a National Youth Congress on May 4th of this year to establish a joint organization of national youth. (2) The Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas will issue a notice requesting youth organizations and young people from all walks of life across the country to quickly send representatives to jointly form a preparatory committee with representatives from the Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas, responsible for preparing matters related to convening the National Youth Congress. The Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas of China was established at the Youth Representative Conference of the Liberated Areas convened in September 1947.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th] The Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas of China has recently issued a notice regarding the convening of the National Youth Congress. The full text is as follows: To youth organizations and young friends from all walks of life across the country!
    The Chinese people have achieved great victories in the Liberation War. This is the result of the long-term struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism.
    Since the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have devoted themselves to the New Democratic revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism, becoming a powerful force in the people's revolutionary movement. The youth of the Liberated Areas of China have played a great and active role in participating in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, participating in land reform and various constructions of New Democracy; the youth in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have played a great active role in the heroic struggle against the Japanese invaders and insisting on opposing American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    At this time of great historical transformation in China, our youth should inherit the glorious tradition since the "May Fourth" Movement, strengthen unity, redouble our efforts, thoroughly liberate the Chinese people, unite with all kinds of revolutionary forces of the national people, smash all the destructive conspiracies of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and strive to build a New Democratic New China. To this end, our Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas of China specially proposes to youth organizations from all over China and young people from all walks of life across the country, to convene the National Youth Congress on May 4th, the Chinese Youth Day, in order to discuss and determine the general task of Chinese youth in the current situation, and to establish the organization of the National Youth Federation, adopt the charter of the National Youth Federation, and elect its leading organs.
    We propose: that a preparatory committee for the National Youth Congress be established rapidly, responsible for preparing all work for convening the National Youth Congress and deciding all matters related to convening the congress. We specially invite youth organizations from all over China and young people from all walks of life across the country to send their own representatives immediately to serve as members of the preparatory committee, and hope that by February 15th, representatives from all over the country will be able to arrive at the location of the Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas to establish the preparatory committee for the National Youth Congress.

    中国人民在解放战争中，已经得到了伟大的胜利。这是由于中国人民长期进行反对帝国主义与封建主义的斗争所获得的结果。
    中国青年从一九一九年的“五四”运动以来，一贯地在中国共产党的领导之下，尽力于反对帝国主义与封建主义的新民主主义的革命斗争，成为人民革命运动中一支强大的力量。中国解放区的青年，在参加抗日战争与人民解放战争，参加土地改革与新民主主义的各种建设上；国民党统治区的青年，在反对日寇与坚持反对美帝国主义与国民党反动派的英勇斗争上，都起了伟大的积极的作用。
    目前正当中国历史伟大转变的时期，我们青年应该继承“五四”运动以来的光荣传统，加强团结，加紧努力，为彻底解放中国人民，并与全国人民群众的各种革命力量团结起来，为粉碎美国帝国主义及国民党反动派的一切破坏阴谋，为建设新民主主义的新中国而奋斗。为此目的，我们中国解放区的青年联合会特向全中国各地青年团体及全国各界青年群众提议，在本年五月四日中国青年节召开全中国的青年代表大会，借以讨论与决定目前形势下中国青年的总任务，并成立全国青年联合会的组织，通过全国青年联合会的章程，和选出它的领导机关。
    我们提议：迅速成立全国青年代表大会的筹备委员会，负责筹备召开全国青年代表大会的一切工作并决定有关召开大会的一切事项。我们特邀请全国各地青年团体全国各界青年群众即日派出自己的代表，担任筹备会委员，并望在二月十五日以前，各地代表都能到达解放区青年联合会所在地，成立全国青年代表大会的筹备委员会。
