Xinhua News Agency, North China, 20th—The captured generals of the traitor Fu Zuoyi are talking about his wretched state under the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army. These prisoners said that after the complete annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in the Northeast, the traitor Fu Zuoyi, who was directly aided and touted by the American imperialists, began to get anxious, pacing around in his house all day, shaking his head, stamping his feet, and sighing. He would lose his temper at the slightest thing. His subordinates dared not meet him for a week. In early November of last year, the traitor Fu Zuoyi summoned 34 of his senior subordinates to a meeting to discuss "countermeasures" after the Northeast People's Liberation Army entered the pass. The meeting place was deserted. Traitor Chu Xichun and bandit Guo Zongfen, who had just run out of Taiyuan and were preparing to serve as "Tangshan Garrison Commander," sat silently beside the traitor Fu Zuoyi without saying a word. Lin Weichou, the army commander of the 62nd Army (already captured in Tianjin), gave a "report on the failure of the Jin-Shen Campaign" at the meeting, complaining about the corruption of Chiang Kai-shek's army in the Northeast. The traitor Fu Zuoyi also scolded, "The Chiang Kai-shek's army in the Northeast is too incompetent and useless." But when discussing how they themselves should deal with the attack of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, no one could come up with a good idea. A few days later, the traitor Fu Zuoyi specially summoned several of his confidants to his private office, including Guo Jingyun, army commander of the 35th Army (already killed), Feng Zi, division commander of the 101st Division (already surrendered), and Wen Hanmin, division commander of the 267th Division (already surrendered). The traitor Fu Zuoyi clenched his fists, widened his eyes, and said repeatedly: "The situation is too serious, the situation is too serious! This winter's battle will be unprecedentedly fierce. Whether we fight well or badly depends entirely on you." In mid-November, bandit troops in Chengde, Baoding, and Shanhaiguan successively fled, and squeezed into Tianjin and Beijing with other bandit troops. In early December, the People's Liberation Army attacked the periphery of Zhangjiakou. The traitor Fu Zuoyi hurriedly flew from Beijing to Zhangjiakou to "give instructions in person." At an emergency cadre meeting, the traitor Fu Zuoyi was restless, fidgeting. The difficult problem of "should we defend Zhangjiakou? How to defend it?" dragged on for more than three hours without being resolved. Suddenly, he received intelligence that Lin Biao's troops from the Northeast had "appeared" in Changping. The traitor Fu Zuoyi immediately staggered out of the meeting place, and the meeting broke up without a result. When the People's Liberation Army encircled and annihilated the 35th Army in Xinbao'an, the traitor Fu Zuoyi was simply like a man who had lost his soul and had no idea what to do. He sent several telegrams to the 35th Army one after another, at one time saying, "We must endure the pain of burning the vehicles and break through," at another time saying that "two companies should be left to guard the vehicles, without revealing any signs of a breakout, and then break through on foot." At one time he wanted the 35th Army to "wait for reinforcements," and at another time he called for "waiting for an opportunity..." Finally, he also said, "Headquarters has its own proper methods." On December 22, when the assault troops of the People's Liberation Army stormed into the city, Guo Jingyun realized that there was nothing he could do and sent a telegram scolding the traitor Fu Zuoyi for deceiving him. Halfway through the telegram, the People's Liberation Army had reached the roof of his house and cut off the radio antenna. The senior enemy prisoner also confessed to the traitor Fu Zuoyi's failure on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou line, saying: "This time we are like a chain, one link entrapping another. The 105th Army (annihilated in Zhangjiakou) held up the 35th Army, the 35th Army (annihilated in Xinbao'an) held up the 104th Army, and the 104th Army (annihilated in Huailai) held up the 16th Army (annihilated in Kangzhuang). Fu Zuoyi originally wanted to echo each other and rescue each other, but in the end none of them escaped."

　　傅匪作义面临覆灭
  　整天摇头顿脚唉声叹气
    【新华社华北二十日电】傅匪作义在解放军铁拳下的狼狈状态，是他的被俘虏的将领们的话题。这些俘虏们说：在东北蒋匪全军覆灭之后，受美帝国主义者直接援助和吹捧的傅匪作义就开始焦急起来，整天在房子里转来转去，摇头顿脚，唉声叹气。一有了事情就乱发脾气。他的部属有一个礼拜不敢见他的面。去年十一月初，傅匪召集了他的高级部属三十四人开会，讨论东北解放军入关后的“对策”，会场冷清清的。楚匪溪春及刚从太原跑出准备作“唐山警备司令”的郭匪宗汾，默坐在傅匪身边一句话也不说。六十二军军长林匪伟俦（已在天津就俘）在会上作了一个“锦沈失败经过报告”，埋怨东北蒋军的腐败。傅匪也大骂“东北蒋军太窝囊太无能。”但当讨论他们自己如何来对付东北人民解放军的进攻时，却谁也拿不出一个好主意。几天之后，傅匪又特别在他的私人办公室召见他的几个亲信，计有三十五军军长郭景云（已被击毙），一零一师师长冯梓（已就俘），二六七师师长温汉民（已就俘）等数人。傅匪握紧拳头，睁大眼睛，连声地说：“局面太严重，局面是太严重啊！今年冬天的战斗会空前惨烈，打好打坏全凭你们。”十一月中，承德、保定及山海关等地的匪军先后逃跑，与其他匪军一股儿挤到平津。十二月初，解放军攻打张垣外围，傅匪连忙由平飞张“面授机宜”。在一个紧急召集的干部会上，傅匪坐立不安，晃来晃去，一个“守不守张垣？如何守法？”的难题，拖延了三个多钟头解决不了，忽然又接到东北林彪部队在昌平“出现”的情报，傅匪立即跟跄走出会场，会议无结果而散。及至解放军在新保安围歼三十五军时，傅匪简直象丧失了灵魂似的，一点儿没有主意了。他先后给三十五军发了多次电报，一时说：“要忍痛烧毁汽车突围”，一时又要“留两个连看守汽车，不露突围迹象，而后徒步突围”。一时要三十五军“待援”，一时又叫“待机……”，最后还说“本部自有妥善办法”。十二月二十二日，解放军突击部队攻入城内，郭景云发觉已毫无办法，拍电报大骂傅匪骗了他，电报发了一半，解放军已进至他的房顶并打断了无线电的天线。该高级敌俘又供述傅匪在平张线上的失败情形说：“我们这次就象连环套一样，一环套一环互相套住了。一零五军（在张垣被歼）拉住三十五军，三十五军（在新保安被歼）拉住一零四军，一零四军（在怀来被歼）又拉住十六军（在康庄被歼）。傅作义本想彼此呼应相互援救，结果哪一个都没跑得脱。”
