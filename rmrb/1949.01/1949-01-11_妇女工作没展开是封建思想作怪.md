　　【Taihang Telegram】The Shexian County Party Committee criticized and examined the feudal viewpoints that hindered the development of women's work at the County Party Committee meeting on December 9th. Summarized, they are as follows:

　　1. Believing that women are backward and looking down on them; not only failing to pay attention to solving women's difficulties, but also adopting a dismissive attitude. This is an ideological reason why it was impossible to deeply mobilize women in the past, and it also formed the view of underestimating women's work. The leadership unconsciously preserves feudal ideas, hinders women's liberation, and does not improve the ideological awareness and social status of peasant women. The revolutionary struggle in recent years has produced many female cadres, which shows that women can be improved, especially because they are working-class women.

　　2. Believing that women's liberation seems to be opposed to men, and therefore not letting go of women's liberation. Failing to recognize that only the common liberation of oppressed men and women is true class liberation.

　　3. In dealing with issues such as marriage, there is a feudal viewpoint that women are subordinate to the interests of men. Many cadres have a lot of trouble dealing with farmers' divorces, thinking that if they divorce immediately, the farmers will immediately have no home, and it will not be easy to find another wife. This is especially true for retired soldiers and poor and lower-middle peasants. They also know the principle of freedom of marriage, but in order to show care for retired soldiers and poor and lower-middle peasants, they give women away as a "favor," only thinking about the pain of farmers after divorce, but not the pain of women being oppressed and not having freedom of marriage. This is not a proletarian viewpoint. A revolutionary should not be afraid of transforming society. The oppression and lack of freedom of the broad masses of working women and family discord hinder the development of women's productivity. One should not stand on a backward viewpoint and oppose women's liberation because of fear of so-called social opinion or resistance from certain cadres. This is precisely the feudal ideology that maintains feudal order.

　　4. The view of certain promiscuous behaviors of women also starts from a strong feudal viewpoint, believing that this is a great stain on women themselves, and not recognizing that this is a social problem caused by the unfree feudal marriage system. As long as the policy of freedom of marriage is implemented in the future and women's education is strengthened, it can be transformed.

　　After the above examination of leadership ideology, everyone has further improved their understanding of the importance of women's work and realized that it is necessary to start with the ideological revolution of cadres in order to promote the whole party to do it.

### 妇女工作没展开是封建思想作怪

　　妇女工作没展开是封建思想作怪
    【太行电】涉县县委于十二月九日在县委会上检查批判了阻碍妇女工作开展的封建观点。综合起来有以下几点：
    一、认为妇女落后看不起妇女；对于妇女的困难，不但不注意解决，而且抱轻视态度。这是过去不能深入发动妇女的一个思想原因，也由此形成轻视妇女工作的观点。领导上不自觉的保存着封建思想，阻挠妇女解放，不去提高农民妇女的思想觉悟及其社会地位。几年来的革命斗争已涌现了不少妇女干部，这说明妇女是可以提高的，特别因为她们是劳动阶级妇女。
    二、认为妇女解放好象就是与男人对立的，因之对妇女的解放不放手。没有认识只有被压迫的男女共同解放，才是真正的阶级解放。
    三、对婚姻等问题处理上，存在着妇女从属于男人利益的封建观点。不少干部在处理农民的离婚问题时，很费周折，认为一下离了婚，农民马上就没有了家，再找个老婆是不大容易的事。特别是对荣退军人及贫雇则更是如此。他们也知道婚姻自主的原则，但为了表示对荣退军人及贫雇的照顾，就将妇女送了“人情”，只想到农民离了婚痛苦，没想到妇女受压迫，婚姻不自由的痛苦，这不是无产阶级观点。一个革命者不应当怕改造社会，广大劳动妇女受压迫，不自由，家庭不和，是阻碍妇女生产力发展的，不应因为害怕一时的所谓社会舆论，或某些干部的抵抗，而站到落后的观点上，反对妇女解放，这正是维持封建秩序的封建思想。
    四、对妇女某些性乱行为的看法，也是从浓厚的封建观点出发的，认为这是妇女本身莫大的污点，没有认识这是个社会问题，是不自由的封建的婚姻制度造成的，只要今后执行了婚姻自由政策与加强妇女的教育，是可以改造的。
    经过以上领导思想上的检查，大家都对妇女工作的重要，在认识上更进了一步，更体会到必须先从干部思想革命作起，才能推动全党来作。
