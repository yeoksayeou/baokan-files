[Jinzhong Telegram] The Jinzhong Third Special District Administrative Office convened a meeting of the heads of construction departments and directors of cooperative associations from various counties at the beginning of this month to study and promote winter production work. According to the meeting's report, since the Administrative Office's production and construction meeting in October, counties have begun to attach importance to water conservancy construction and have integrated it with frontline support. Pingyao has begun surveying and dredging old canals. In Pingyao, Qi County, and Jiexiu, people along the Fen River are building dams to prepare for large-scale land irrigation next spring. However, the leadership of industry, mining, and other mass-based winter production efforts has been relaxed, left to develop spontaneously without being appropriately integrated with frontline support. In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of winter production and resolve the contradictions between frontline support and production, the meeting made the following specific regulations: (1) Villages should establish mutual aid organizations for production and frontline support, based on voluntary association and equal-value exchange through democratic discussion among the masses, and establish democratic discipline. Leaders should accurately calculate, coordinate comprehensively, and overcome the phenomenon of averaging the use of civilian labor and animal power in areas heavily affected by war and disasters, as well as in general areas, and between villages, households, and should scientifically use civilian animal power. They should correct the tendency in some areas to abandon production while waiting for deployment due to the expectation of support duties in the rear, or to neglect support duties due to a sole focus on production. Counties and districts must grasp and implement the regular replacement of frontline civilian laborers to ensure that war support is fair and reasonable. (2) When settling accounts for the first phase of war support work, attention should be paid to distinguishing between frontline war support work and rear-area voluntary work. Do not calculate general sporadic tasks in the rear as the same as frontline tasks. Frontline tasks are calculated by the day, while semi-able-bodied people helping producers in the rear are calculated by the job. Adjustments should be made between villages and between households. Appropriate grain compensation should be given to blacksmiths and carpenters providing frontline support. (3) Appropriate consideration should be given to the burden of war support for people in uninhabited areas, disaster areas, and urban industrial and commercial poor. (4) Organize semi-able-bodied people to carry out winter production, and pay special attention to leading women and children in production. (5) In terms of cooperatives: the main task in old areas is to restore and rectify, and organize the masses to produce based on existing strength; new areas will not be organized for the time being, but leadership should be strengthened where the masses have already organized themselves. In addition, counties and districts should establish dedicated personnel to lead winter production. Economic departments at all levels should focus on winter production and strengthen leadership of production in disaster areas, providing loan assistance.

　　晋中三专署召开生产会议
  　解决生产支前矛盾
    【晋中电】晋中三专署于本月初召集各县建设科长、县联社长会议，研究推进冬季生产工作。根据会议反映，自十月行署生产建设会议以来，各县在兴修水利上已引起重视，并与支前相结合。平遥对旧河渠开始了勘测和修浚。平遥、祁县、介休沿汾河群众正修筑坝口，准备明春大量灌溉土地。但对工矿业以及其他群众性的冬季生产，则未能与支前适当结合进行。领导松懈，陷于自流。为了加强冬季生产的组织领导，解决支前与生产上的矛盾，会议上特作了如下的具体规定：（一）村建立生产支前互助组织，经过群众民主讨论，自愿结合，等价交换，定出民主纪律。领导上应精确计算，通盘调剂，克服战勤上灾重区与一般区及村与村、户与户的平均使用民力现象，科学的使用民畜力，纠正某些地区在后方因听候支差而放弃生产，或单纯生产而耽误支前的偏向。县区必须掌握贯彻定期替换前方民工，使战勤作到公平合理。（二）结算第一阶段战勤工帐，应注意区别前方战勤工与后方义务工，勿将后方一般零星差务与前方差混同计算。前方差以日计工，后方半劳力帮助生产者，以活计工。村与村、户与户进行调剂。对支前铁木匠，应适当贴米赚工。（三）对无人区、灾区以及城市工商业贫民，在战勤负担上，应予以适当照顾。（四）组织半劳力进行冬季生产，特别应注意领导妇女、儿童生产。（五）合作社方面：老区主要是恢复整顿，在现有的力量上，组织群众生产；新区暂不组织，但群众已组织者，应注意领导。此外，县区应设专人领导冬季生产。各级经济部门，应以冬季生产为中心，并加强对灾区生产领导，予以贷款帮助。
