A Certain Unit of the North China Field Army
Summarizes Experience in Urban Discipline

[This Dispatch] In the battle of Chahar-Suiyuan, a certain unit of the North China Field Army captured the cities of Guangling and Yangyuan, as well as the towns of Dongcheng and Nuanquan. They achieved excellent results in enforcing city entry discipline. The experience gained by this unit is as follows:

　　I. Thorough Mobilization and Education: Before the campaign, the political department of the unit issued city entry instructions. All levels carried out mobilization and education based on these instructions and organized discussions. Concrete guarantees were proposed within squads and platoons. Every soldier expressed their determination to strictly abide by urban discipline, regarding it as a major item in their meritorious service plan. The 3rd Company of a certain regiment proposed: "If discipline is violated, meritorious service will be nullified; if there is no meritorious service, a demerit will be recorded." The 8th Squad proposed: "If one person in the squad violates discipline, the entire squad is responsible; if one person in the combat team violates discipline, the entire team is responsible." The cultural troupe performed short plays on protecting industry and commerce three days prior to the operation, as supplementary education. After the battle, units were organized to visit and learn from each other.

　　II. Strict Organizational Leadership: Due to thorough mobilization and leadership attention, each brigade and regiment organized discipline inspection teams or political work groups, and announced their tasks and powers before the teams; battalions and companies also organized temporary discipline inspection groups to supervise and inspect the implementation of discipline. It was emphasized that each unit only had the responsibility to guard enemy materials and no power to use them; violators would be held responsible by the unit leader. Prior to entering the city, a concrete survey of public institutions and enemy warehouses within the city was conducted. Based on the specific tasks of the attacking forces, the area for maintaining discipline was clearly demarcated. After entering the city, unified command was implemented, and work teams and work groups immediately entered the city to maintain discipline and inspect enemy materials, and to solve the problem of troop meals in a planned way. After the battle, the city defense forces were designated by the city attack command, and all units had to submit to the inspection and supervision of the city defense forces; other troops immediately withdrew outside the city. Non-combat personnel, militiamen, laborers, local armed forces, etc., were all prohibited from entering the city. This ensured unified command, which enabled rapid overcoming of the post-battle chaos and restoration of order in the city. Because this point was well executed, most businesses in Guangling City reopened for business within an hour of its capture.

　　III. Consciously Abide by and Mutually Supervise to Ensure the Implementation of Discipline: Due to thorough pre-war mobilization and strict organizational leadership, a mass upsurge in maintaining discipline was created during and after the battle. Propaganda was also carried out during the battle. During the battle to capture Guangling, a certain battalion of a certain regiment cleaned up all enemy slogans in the South Gate within two hours and wrote our army's slogans. Regarding the captured materials, each unit automatically guarded them and did not move them at all. Small bowls, balls of thread, and rice packages found by the 4th Company were all handed over to the public. When a certain regiment inspected discipline after the battle, only one soldier in the entire regiment was found to have taken a fountain pen, which was immediately corrected. After a certain unit captured Dongcheng Town in Yangyuan, a soldier from the 2nd Battalion guarded a warehouse. The battalion commander and a staff officer were also stopped and not allowed to enter. Wang Junjie, the platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon of the 3rd Company of a certain regiment (a non-Party member), gave eggs from the villagers to the 4th Squad, but was refused by the squad leader, who raised the issue at the Party group meeting: "We Party members cannot be the tails of the masses." Therefore, although there were individual violations of discipline, they could be discovered and stopped and corrected in a timely manner.

### 华北野战军某部　总结城市纪律经验

　　华北野战军某部
  　总结城市纪律经验
    【本报讯】华北野战军某部，于察绥作战中，曾克广灵、阳原两城及东城、暖泉诸镇，在执行入城纪律上成绩甚佳，该部所获经验如下：
    一、深入动员教育：该部政治部在战役前，曾发出入城指令，各级按此进行了动员教育，并组织讨论，班、排内提出具体保证，每个战士都表示了坚决遵守城市纪律的决心，把它当作立功计划中的主要项目。某团三连提出：“犯了纪律，有功免功，无功记过。”八班提出：“班里一人犯纪律，全班负责；战斗小组里一人犯纪律，全组负责。”文工团并于前三日演出保护工商业的短剧，作为补助教育。战斗结束后，组织各单位互相参观，互相学习。
    二、严密的组织领导：由于动员的深入和领导上的重视，各旅、团都组织了纪律检查队或政工组，并在队前宣布其任务和权力；营连也组织了临时纪律检查组，监督和检查纪律的执行。并强调指出：各单位发现敌人物资，只有看管之责，没有动用之权，违者由该单位首长负责。入城前具体调查城内公共机关及敌之仓库情况，依攻城部队具体任务，明确划分维持纪律区域。入城后统一指挥，工作团、工作组马上入城，维持纪律，检查敌人物资，有计划的解决部队吃饭问题。战斗结束后由攻城指挥机关指定卫戍部队，所有一切单位都要服从卫戍部队的检查与监督；其他部队立即撤出城外。非战斗人员及民兵、民工、地方武装等，一律禁止入城。这样就保证了指挥上的统一，而能迅速克服战斗后的混乱现象，恢复城内秩序。由于这点做得好，广灵城攻克后一个钟头，大部商户即开张营业。
    三、自觉遵守，互相监督，保证纪律的执行：由于战前的深入动员和严密的组织领导，在战斗中、战斗后，造成了群众性的维护纪律的热潮。并能一面战斗、一面宣传。攻克广灵战斗中，某团一营在南关两小时内洗刷了敌人所有的标语，写上了我军的标语。某团对缴获物资，各单位自动看守，丝毫未动。四连搜索出来的小碗、线球、饭包等，都交了公。某团于战后检查纪律时，全团只有一个战士拿了一支自来水笔，随即纠正。某部于攻克阳原东城镇后，二营一战士看守仓库，该营营长和一参谋，也被拦阻，不允许进去。某团三连二排长王俊杰（非党员），拿了老乡的鸡蛋给四班，被班长拒绝了，并在党的小组会上提出：“我们党员不能作群众的尾巴。”因之虽有个别犯纪律的，都能被及时发现，予以制止和纠正。
