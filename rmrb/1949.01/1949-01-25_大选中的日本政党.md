　　Japanese Political Parties in the General Election
    Following the passage of a no-confidence vote against the Yoshida Cabinet by the Japanese House of Representatives on December 23rd of last year, the Yoshida Cabinet, refusing to resign, dissolved the House. The Yoshida Cabinet decided to hold the third post-war general election for the Japanese House of Representatives on January 23rd of this year. Because the House of Representatives has greater, even decisive, power than the House of Councillors in decision-making and cabinet formation, Japanese political parties are engaged in fierce election campaigns for this purpose.
    The Japanese political parties participating in this general election can be divided into two categories within the democratic camp: the Japanese Communist Party, representing the Japanese working people, and the progressive Labor-Farmer Party. In the anti-democratic camp, according to their manifestations, they can be divided into two categories: one category openly represents monopoly capital and landlord feudal forces, including the Democratic Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, the People's Cooperative Party, and the Japan Farmers' Party; the other category promotes social reformism but is actually an agent of the bourgeoisie, including the Socialist Party and the Social Renovation Party.
    The organizer and leader of the Japanese democratic camp, the Japanese Communist Party, has suffered long-term and cruel persecution from the Japanese ruling class since its birth in July 1922. The party organization was often destroyed, and party leaders were either killed or imprisoned for long periods. However, all of this could not eliminate the JCP's profound influence among the masses. After Japan's surrender in 1945, when JCP leaders such as Tokuda Kyuichi, Nosaka Sanzo (Okano Susumu), and Shiga Yoshio were released from prison or returned from abroad, the JCP quickly recovered and developed. In December 1945, the JCP had only 1,200 members, but by 1947, it had increased to 100,000. The JCP has a deep influence among organized labor. The Japanese Federation of Industrial Unions, with more than 2 million members, the Communications Workers' Union, with more than 400,000 members, and the Farmers' Association, with more than 1 million members, all support the JCP's policies. Due to various persecutions and suppressions by the American and Japanese reactionaries, the JCP failed to obtain parliamentary seats commensurate with its strength in the past two general elections. In the first general election, the JCP received more than 2 million votes and won a total of six seats in both houses. In the second general election, it increased to eight seats. In this campaign, the JCP has presented itself as a mass party, fielding 116 candidates and campaigning independently nationwide. Currently, the members of the JCP Politburo include Tokuda Kyuichi, Nosaka Sanzo, Shiga Yoshio, Miyamoto Kenji, Ito Ritsu, and Kamiyama Shigeo, with Tokuda as the General Secretary of the party.
    The Labor-Farmer Party was established in October of last year. It is composed of progressive elements who split from the Socialist Party, led by Kuroda Hisao, and has considerable influence in Japanese labor and farmer organizations. Since its establishment, it has been an ally of the JCP.
    In the anti-democratic camp, the Democratic Liberal Party and the Democratic Party are composed of the most reactionary large capitalists, landlords, and bureaucrats in Japan, representing the interests of Japanese monopoly capital and feudal groups. Their predecessors were the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, which actively supported imperialist aggression before and during the war. After the war, they changed their names and were established as the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party in November 1945, respectively. At the end of March 1947, the Progressive Party changed its name to the Democratic Party. In March 1948, the Liberal Party merged with a faction led by Shidehara, which seceded from the Democratic Party, and changed its name to the Democratic Liberal Party. These two parties, with the support of American imperialism and large amounts of "election buying" funds from the zaibatsu, stole the majority of seats in the parliament in the two post-war general elections. In the last House of Representatives, the Democratic Liberal Party had 151 seats, and the Democratic Party had 126 seats. The leader of the Democratic Liberal Party is Yoshida Shigeru. The leader of the Democratic Party is Ashida Hitoshi, but after Ashida was arrested in the "Showa Denko" corruption scandal, he has been succeeded by Inukai Ken.
    The People's Cooperative Party was formed in March 1947 by the merger of the Cooperative Democratic Party and the People's Party, led by Miki Takeo and Okada Seiichi. It has many internal factions and mainly represents the interests of the Japanese feudal aristocracy, landlords, and some local middle-class bourgeoisie. The Japan Farmers' Party is composed of a group of party members within the Cooperative Democratic Party who opposed the merger with the People's Party, led by Kita Katsutaro. The People's Cooperative Party and the Farmers' Party have consistently been vassals of the Democratic Liberal Party and the Democratic Party in politics. In the last general election, the People's Cooperative Party won 32 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Farmers' Party won eight seats.
    The Japanese Socialist Party, which promotes so-called social reformism, was established in November 1945. It is composed of two pre-war social reformist parties: the Social Masses Party (which includes the Social Democratic Party led by Katayama Tetsu, Matsuoka Komakichi, and Nishio Suehiro, and the Japan Labor-Farmer Party led by Asanuma Inejirō and Nozoe Masaru) and the Japan Proletarian Party (led by Kato Kanji and Suzuki Mosaburo). At the beginning of the party's establishment, there was a dispute between the factions led by Nishio and Matsuoka and the factions led by Kato and Suzuki on the issue of whether to cooperate with the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party or to jointly form a people's front with the Communist Party. However, after Kato and Suzuki issued a shameless anti-communist statement in May 1947, and after a group of progressive elements led by Kuroda Hisao seceded from the Socialist Party to form the Labor-Farmer Party, there is no longer a distinction between left and right wings within today's Socialist Party leadership, and all have been reduced to pawns of American and Japanese monopoly capital. The deceptive role of the Socialist Party among the masses is rapidly diminishing, and many of its local branches and party members have left the Socialist Party and joined the ranks of the Japanese Communist Party.
    The Social Renovation Party was formed in October 1947 by a group of party members who split from the Socialist Party, led by the social fascist Hirano Rikizo, and is now led by Satake Haruki, with only about 20 seats in the last House of Representatives.

### 大选中的日本政党

　　大选中的日本政党
    日本众议院因在去年十二月二十三日通过了对吉田内阁的不信任案，被拒绝辞职的吉田内阁解散了，吉田内阁决定于今年一月二十三日举行日本战后第三次的众院选举。由于众院在决策与组织内阁上，具有较参院为大的以至决定性的权力，因此，日本各政党正为此展开激烈的竞选斗争。
    此次参加大选的日本政党，在民主阵营方面，有日本劳动人民的代表日本共产党与进步的工农党。在反民主阵营方面，按其表现形态的不同，可分为两类：一类是公开代表独占资本与地主封建势力的，其中有民主自由党、民主党、国民协同党与日本农民党；一类是标榜社会改良主义而实际是资产阶级的代理人的，有社会党与社会革新党。
    日本民主阵营的组织者与领导者——日本共产党，自一九二二年七月诞生以来，曾遭受到日本统治阶级长期的残酷迫害，党的组织经常被破坏，党的领袖或被杀害或被长期囚于狱中。但是，所有这些都不能消除日共在群众中的深刻影响。一九四五年日本投降以后，当德田球一、野坂参三（冈野进）、志贺义雄等日共领袖或自狱中释放或自国外归来以后，日共便迅速恢复与发展起来。一九四五年十二月，日共还仅有党员一千二百名，至一九四七年时，已增至十万名。日共在有组织的劳动群众中，已有深厚的影响。拥有二百余万会员的日本产业工会联合会、拥有四十余万会员的递信工人工会以及拥有一百余万会员的农会，都支持日共的政策。由于美日反动派的种种迫害与压制，在过去两届大选中，日共未能获得与其实力相称的议席。第一届大选时，日共得票二百余万，在参众两院共获六席。第二届大选时增至八席。在此次竞选中，日共已以群众性大党的新姿态，提出了一百一十六名候选人，在全国范围内独立地竞选。现在，日共政治局的委员有德田球一、野坂参三、志贺义雄、宫本显治、伊藤律、神山茂夫等，德田为党的总书记。
    工农党于去年十月成立。它是由社会党内部分裂出来的进步分子所组成，以黑田寿男为首，在日本工农组织中有相当影响。它自成立以来，一直是日共的同盟者。
    在反民主阵营方面，民主自由党与民主党，是由日本最反动的大资本家、大地主与官僚所组成，代表日本独占资本与封建集团的利益。他们的前身是战前与战时积极支持帝国主义侵略的政友会与民政党。战后，他们改头换面，于一九四五年十一月分别成立自由党与进步党。一九四七年三月末，进步党易名为民主党。一九四八年三月，自由党与以币原为首的、脱离民主党的一派合流，易名为民主自由党。这两个政党由于有美国帝国主义的支持与财阀的大笔“买选”费，在战后两届大选中，曾窃取了议会的多数。在上届众院中，民主自由党有一五一席，民主党有一二六席。民主自由党的党魁是吉田茂。民主党的党魁是芦田均，但在芦田均因“昭和电工”大贪污案被捕人狱后，已由犬养健继任党魁。
    国民协同党是一九四七年三月由协同民主党与国民党合并而成的，以三木武夫与冈田势一为首。内部派系繁多，主要代表日本封建贵族、地主与一部分地方中等资产阶级的利益。日本农民党，是由协同民主党内反对与国民党合并的一部分党员所组成，以北胜太郎为首。国民协同党与农民党在政治上一贯是民主自由党与民主党的附庸。上届大选时，国民协同党在众院获得三十二席，农民党获八席。
    标榜所谓社会改良主义的日本社会党，成立于一九四五年十一月，它是由战前两个社会改良主义的政党：社会大众党（它包括以片山哲，松冈驹吉、西尾末广为首的社会民主党与以浅沼稻次郎、野沟胜为首的日本劳农党）及日本无产党（以加藤勘十、铃木茂三郎为首）所组成的。该党成立之初，以西尾、松冈为首与以加藤、铃木为首的两派之间，在与自由党、进步党合作抑与共产党共同筹组人民战线这一问题上，曾有过争执。但是，在加藤与铃木于一九四七年五月发表无耻的反共声明以后，在以黑田寿男为首的一批进步分子脱离社会党另组工农党以后，今天的社会党领导集团内，已无左右派之分，都已沦为美日垄断资本的走卒。社会党在群众中的欺骗作用正在迅速降低，它的许多地方支部和党员，已纷纷脱离社会党，参加了日本共产党的行列。
    社会革新党是一九四七年十月以社会法西斯分子平野力三为首、由社会党内部分裂出来的一部分党员所组成，现以佐竹晴记为首，在上届众院中仅有二十余议席。
