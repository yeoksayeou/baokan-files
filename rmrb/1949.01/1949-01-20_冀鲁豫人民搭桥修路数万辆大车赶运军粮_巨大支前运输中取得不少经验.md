　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Electricity] The broad masses of the people in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region are building bridges and roads in the face of the severe cold with unparalleled enthusiasm to rush to transport military grain. Under the slogan of striving for the early victory of the country, the whole region has fully invested in the huge wave of frontline support. Under the slogan of striving for the early victory of the country, the whole region's rice milling task was completed on December 15th. Then tens of thousands of large and small vehicles, loaded with fine rice, poured towards the front lines. By the end of December, tens of millions of kilograms of fine rice from our 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th sub-regions had been transported to the Longhai Railway line after hundreds of miles of arduous journey. Tens of thousands of kilograms of rice from our 6th and 9th sub-regions were transported in four routes to the north of Jinan. Our 4th sub-region also transported millions of kilograms to the banks of the Yellow River. The heavy snow a few days ago could not stop the advance of this people's grain transport army. The grain transport laborers in Shan County and Dangshan of the 3rd sub-region carried the grain to the front-line grain stations through the rain and snow when the vehicles could not pass at all. The roads were even more difficult to travel after the snow, and the people along the grain transport lines began to build bridges and clear the snow on the roads. The bridges and roads on each line were quickly repaired. Dangshan County alone built seven large bridges, including Da Xuzhuang, Old Yellow River Bottom, and Zhangzhai, specifically for the grain transport line of the 7th sub-region, and all transportation lines were unimpeded. Therefore, the arduous grain transport task of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region is expected to be completed before February 25th of the old lunar calendar. The main reasons for obtaining the above achievements: (1) The awakening of the broad masses of emancipated peasants and the enthusiasm for wiping out Chiang Kai-shek and avenging their hatred. The people on the south bank of the Yellow River have suffered all kinds of devastation from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits over the past two years, such as rape, arson, and murder. Hearing that the Kuomintang's 5th Army and Qiu Qingquan were to be eliminated (note: the enemy was completely annihilated by our army on the 10th of this month), the unanimous response was: "We have suffered enough in these two years. If we don't eliminate these grandsons, we really can't live." Therefore, they showed unprecedented enthusiasm in grain transport and other war support work. For example, the village head of a village in Dingtao County sent three large carts to transport rice, and the villagers rushed forward, competing to go. The stretcher-bearers of the mobile stretcher team in Chengwu County transported continuously for seven days in Dangshan City. The three passes of Xiaorentun were all opened, so that the transportation of the grain stations of the 3rd and 7th sub-regions was not hindered in any way. (2) Organized and planned. The general large vehicle laborers were organized into platoons, companies, battalions, or detachments, squadrons, and brigades based on districts or counties. The 8th sub-region advanced in batches during the action, so that the vehicles were not too crowded, and the difficulties of eating and lodging were reduced. At the same time, the laborers sent people ahead to negotiate eating and lodging, and helped the local people establish food and lodging stations. After camping every night, the district and village cadres who led the vehicles in Nanwang County of the 7th sub-region held discussions to review discipline and the consumption of grain and firewood for large vehicles and livestock, and planned the route for the next day. Juye County reported every day, praising the good and criticizing the bad. (3) Implementing the contracted transportation system. One or two meters of rice per hundred kilograms per mile. Many people reflected: "We can support the front line and earn food." For example, Sun Ping, a famine refugee from Xixian, Dingtao, made a net profit of 39 kilograms of soybeans in five days for transporting 250 kilograms of rice, and was very happy. (4) Organized mutual assistance. For example, if a car on the south bank breaks down, the rice is transferred to another car in the village, and it is repaired and loaded again. This can speed up the journey. Mutual assistance has also accelerated the speed of transportation. However, at the same time, there are still some shortcomings in grain transport: mainly, some sub-regions are eager to complete the task, and millions of kilograms of grain are rushed at once, forming too much congestion. In addition, the food and lodging stations were not well arranged, and they could not cope with it for a while. Eating, lodging, grass, and firewood became problems. In addition, heavy snow fell, and most of the transport teams did not bring doctors, causing laborers and livestock to die from freezing and poor diet. 2. Many cadres leading grain transport laborers and large vehicles believed that they had completed the task after arriving at the front-line grain station, and gave up leadership of the laborers, resulting in disorderly going and disorderly returning. 3. The grain transport laborers brought too little rations, firewood, and grass, and there were few carpenters in the team, or even none, which caused difficulties such as broken cars that were not easy to repair, livestock that had no grass to eat, and people who had no food to eat. At present, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region War Support Headquarters has proposed: (1) Improve food and lodging stations, (2) Lead laborers to and from, (3) Laborers must bring rations and fodder according to regulations.

　　冀鲁豫人民搭桥修路数万辆大车赶运军粮
  　巨大支前运输中取得不少经验
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区广大人民，正以无比的热情冒着严寒搭桥修路赶运军粮。为完成南援淮海，北援平津的任务而全力投入巨大的支前浪潮中。在争取全国早日胜利的口号下，全区的碾米任务于十二月十五日即全部结束。接着就是数万辆大车、小车满载着细米滚滚涌往前线。到十二月底止，我二、三、五、七等分区数千万斤细米，经过数百里的艰苦路程已运至陇海路沿线。我六、九分区××××万斤的米，分四路运到济南以北。我四分区亦以数百万斤运到黄河沿岸。前几天大雪普降，亦不能阻止这支人民运粮大军的前进。三分区单县、砀山的运粮民工，在车辆全不能通行时，便扛着由雨雪中运到前方粮站。雪后的道路更难行走了，各运粮沿线的人民，便开始搭桥和清扫路上积雪，各线的桥梁和道路均很快修好。仅砀山一县专为七分区运粮线，就修了大徐庄、旧黄河底、张砦等七座大桥，各运输线均畅通无阻。因此，冀鲁豫艰巨的运粮任务预计在旧历的二月二十五日前即可全部完成。获得以上成绩的主要原因：（一）为广大翻身农民的觉悟，与灭蒋雪恨的热情。我黄河南岸的人民，两年来备受蒋匪奸淫烧杀等种种摧残，此次听说要消灭五军邱清泉等蒋匪（按该敌已于本月十日被我全歼），一致的反映：“这二年可叫糟蹋够了，不把这些孬孙消灭，咱真没法过啦。”因之，在运粮等战勤工作中就表现了空前的积极。如定陶县之某村村长，派三辆大车运米，村里群众一拥齐上，争着前往。城武县机动担架的民夫，在砀山城连续运输七天。小人屯塞的三个关全部扒通，使三、七分区的粮站交通不受任何阻碍。（二）有组织、有计划。一般的大车民夫都以区或以县为单位，建立了排、连、营或分队、中队、大队。八分区在行动时分批前进，使车辆不过于拥挤，并减少吃饭住宿地点的困难。民工同时每次都是派人头里交涉吃饭与住的问题，并帮助当地建立食宿站。七分区南旺县新设县系郓城、汶上、寿张、东平各一部，民工每晚宿营后，带领车辆的区村干部便开讨论会，检讨纪律及大车牲口粮柴吃用，计划第二天的走法。钜野县每天都有汇报，好的表扬，坏的批评。（三）实行运输包干制。每百斤一里地一两米，不少群众反映说：“又能支援前线，还能赚粮食。”如定陶西苋的逃荒灾民孙平推，运二百五十斤米往返五天净赚豆子卅九斤，非常高兴。（四）有组织的互相帮助。如南岸有的车坏了，便把米移到本村别的车上，修理好赶上再装。这样可以多赶路。由于互助也加快了运输的速度。但同时运粮中还存在着一些缺点：主要表现在有的分区急于完成任务，数百万斤粮食一拥齐上，形成过于拥挤。加上食宿站布置的不好，一时无法应付，吃饭住宿草料烧柴都成了问题。更加天降大雪，大部运输队没带医生，致民工牲口有因冻与饮食不好而病死者。二、不少带领运粮民工大车之干部，到前方粮站后即认为自己已经完成任务，对民工放弃领导，结果形成无秩序的去，无秩序的回。三、运粮民夫带的给养烧柴草料太少，车队带木匠较少，甚至有的不带，致造成车坏了不好修，牲口没草吃，人没饭吃等困难。目前冀鲁豫战勤总指挥部已提出：（一）健全食宿站，（二）对民工去回皆有领导，（三）民工一定要按规定带给养草料。
