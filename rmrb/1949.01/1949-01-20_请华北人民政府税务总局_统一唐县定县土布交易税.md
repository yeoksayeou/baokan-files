Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor of the North China People's Government Tax Bureau:

　　Both the Central Hebei and North Yue areas are part of the North China Liberated Area, and the tax systems in the two areas should be unified. However, according to what I have seen in the markets of Zhuanlu in Ding County and Tang County City, which are only eighteen li apart, the tax on native cloth transactions is not unified. It is one fen in Zhuanlu and three fen in Tang County City, a big difference. Many merchants say, "Both are areas under the jurisdiction of the North China Government, why is the tax not unified?" This has a bad impact. We have reported this issue to the Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Fifth Administrative Office of North Yue, but it has not been resolved. I suggest that the North China People's Government Tax Bureau should quickly and proactively solve this problem to unify the tax on native cloth transactions in the two places. If there are other special reasons why it cannot be unified, it should also be explained clearly to the masses.

### 请华北人民政府税务总局　统一唐县定县土布交易税

　　请华北人民政府税务总局　统一唐县定县土布交易税编辑同志：
    冀中、北岳两区都是华北解放区的一部分，两区的税收制度是应该统一的。但据我见到定县砖路与唐县城两市场，相隔只十八里地，土布交易税却不统一，砖路是一分，唐县城是三分，相差很多，许多商民说：“都是华北政府管辖地区，为什么税收不统一呢？”这样影响是不好的。这个问题，我们曾向北岳五专署工商局反映过，但也未得到解决。我建议华北人民政府税务总局应迅速主动解决这个问题，使两地土布交易税统一起来。如果是有其他特殊原因，不能统一，也应向群众解释清楚。
