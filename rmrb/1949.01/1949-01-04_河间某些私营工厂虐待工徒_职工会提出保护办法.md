[Ji Zhong News] A recent trade union meeting in Hejian City revealed that some private factories illegally deduct wages from workers and apprentices, and restrict the political freedom of workers and apprentices. Ma Fushun, the owner of a wood factory in Sanxiang, threatened apprentices: "Anyone who joins the trade union will not be allowed to work in the factory." He also spread rumors saying, "The trade union is for expanding the army." Zhou Heling of a certain factory restricted workers from attending meetings; Yongli Carriage Company groundlessly accused a worker of stealing his money, not only forcing him to kneel, but also beating him; several workers from the Peasant Iron Factory sang a few lines when they returned from the theater, and the factory owner scolded the workers and apprentices, and said, "I don't know when I'll drive you away!" Yongli Carriage Company ostensibly stipulates the apprenticeship period as two and a half years, but secretly stipulates four years, in an attempt to exploit apprentice labor; Qingyicheng Hosiery Factory stipulates that apprentices who drop out before the end of their term must compensate for food; Wang Shenghou Shoe Factory took on an 18-year-old apprentice, originally agreeing to provide clothing, with an apprenticeship term of two and a half years; but after a year, no clothes were made, only ten yuan (new currency, same below) was given, and one theater ticket was given. Qi Sanhe of the barber shop originally stipulated that he would provide meals for workers, and the wage bonus would be divided according to labor at a ratio of 40% for the worker and 60% for the owner, but later he privately changed it to not providing meals for workers. In May of last year, Qi Sanhe ran transportation and sales with others, and he said to the worker Liu Junjie: "If you cut hair, we'll split the profits 40% worker and 60% owner, and I'll also split the profits from transportation and sales 40/60 with you." After five months of transportation and sales, Qi Sanhe always said that he didn't make money. The last time he earned 160,000 yuan, he only said he earned 40,000 yuan, and gave the worker 20,000 yuan. Later, the worker found out and was unhappy, so he gave another 10,000 yuan. Jiuxing Iron Factory makes workers work 14 hours a day. When eating, they also have to cook, wash pots, and clean up tools, so that apprentices cannot rest, and some apprentices have vomited blood as a result.

In order to correct the above serious phenomena and conscientiously implement the correct policy of the workers' movement, the meeting put forward the following opinions: (1) Workers' participation in trade unions and meetings is a political right that workers, apprentices, and shop assistants should enjoy, and the factory should not interfere. (2) It is stipulated that there should be half a day each month for workers' education, and to strengthen workers' vocational studies. It is stipulated that there will be one day off for the "February 7th," "May 1st," and October Revolution Day holidays. (3) Workers, apprentices, and shop assistants should sign contracts, and the apprenticeship period should generally not exceed three years. (4) Working hours should not exceed twelve hours at most. (5) If a worker becomes ill in the factory, the factory should be responsible for treatment, and the worker will be responsible for treatment after returning home. (6) Trade unions should strengthen education for workers and improve their political awareness and work efficiency. (Guo Liping)

(The above provisions are very necessary; the illegal acts of capitalists restricting workers' political freedom, depriving workers' and apprentices' wages, and maltreating workers and apprentices should be dealt with according to law. --Editor)

　　河间某些私营工厂虐待工徒
  　职工会提出保护办法
    【冀中讯】河间市最近召开职工会议，检讨出某些私营工厂非法克扣工人、学徒工资，限制工人，学徒政治自由等行为甚多。三乡木厂厂主马福顺威吓学徒：“谁参加工会就不叫谁在厂里作工。”并造谣说：“工会是扩兵的”。某厂周鹤灵限制工人开会；永利车行无故说工人愉了他的钱，不但罚跪，而且把工人打了一顿；农民铁工厂几个工人看戏回来时唱了几句，厂主便把工徒们骂了一顿，并说：“不知哪时把你们打跑哩！”永利车行明着规定学徒年限为二年半，暗中规定四年，企图剥削学徒劳力；庆义城袜厂规定学徒不满期辍学者包赔饭米；王生厚鞋厂拉了一个十八岁的徒弟，原约规定管穿，学期二年半；但过了一年也未给做衣服，只给了十元（新币下同），给过一张看戏票。理发馆齐三和原规定管工人饭，工资分红按劳四资六，但后来私自改为不管工人饭。去年五月间齐三和同别人跑运销，他和工人刘俊杰说：“你剃了头咱工四主六分，我运销赚来的也和你四六分”。经五个月的运销，齐三和每次都说不赚钱，最后一次赚了十六万元，只说赚四万，给工人分二万元，后来工人知道了，不平，才又给了一万元。久兴铁工厂每天让工人做十四小时的工。吃饭时，还得做饭刷锅、收拾工具，使学徒不能休息，有的学徒因此吐了血。
    为了纠正上述严重现象，认真贯彻职工运动的正确方针，会议特提出以下几点意见：（一）工人参加工会与开会是工徒店员应享受的政治权利，厂方不得干涉。（二）规定每月有半天为工人受教育时间，并加强工人业务学习。规定“二七”、“五一”十月革命节各休假一天。（三）工人、学徒、店员要订立合同，学徒期一般的不超过三年。（四）工作时间最多不应超过十二小时。（五）工人在工厂病了，应由厂方负责治疗，回家后自己负责。（六）工会应加强对工人的教育，提高政治觉悟和工作效率。（郭立平）
    （以上这些规定是很必要的；资方限制工人政治自由、剥夺工徒工资和虐待工徒等非法行为，应依法处理。——编者）
