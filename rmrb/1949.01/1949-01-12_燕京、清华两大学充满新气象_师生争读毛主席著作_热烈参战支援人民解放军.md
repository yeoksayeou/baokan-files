Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Beiping-Tianjin, 9th: Since the liberation of the western suburbs of Beiping, Yanjing and Tsinghua Universities have been filled with a new atmosphere. Except for a one-day suspension of classes on December 14th due to the war situation, Yanjing University resumed normal classes on the 15th. When the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army arrived outside the gates of Yanjing University on the 14th, they gently knocked on the door and said to the students inside, "We are the People's Liberation Army, here to protect you. Please don't be afraid." The students inside responded warmly, "We are not afraid!" and immediately rushed out of the campus, vying with students from other schools to visit the People's Liberation Army. On the 19th, Comrade Liu Daosheng, Director of the Political Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, gave a lecture at the university. The auditorium was packed with jubilant listeners. The students eagerly demanded to learn new knowledge. More than 500 students who remained at the university have automatically formed 40 study groups to study books such as "On New Democracy" and "On Coalition Government." The Yanjing University Student Union held a forum on "Understanding the New Society," which was attended by more than 300 students, the largest forum held at the university in the past six months. Professors have also freely formed four groups to study current affairs, the new education system, and other issues. Tsinghua University resumed classes on December 29th. The university affairs of Tsinghua are still presided over by the former "Protection Committee." The "Protection Committee" is composed of five units: the Professors' Association, the Student Union, the Staff Union, and the Laborer-School Police Joint Association. There are currently more than 1,850 students at the university. Under the leadership of the Student Union, they have launched a new study movement. Various levels of the union have massively reprinted books such as "On New Democracy" for students to read. The "Tsinghua Times," posted on the "Democracy Wall," publishes news of the People's Liberation Army's victories, often attracting long lines of readers. Many professors have automatically formed a committee to discuss the academic system and study methods to improve it. In addition to studying and researching, the students are also enthusiastically discussing how to cooperate with the situation and participate in revolutionary work. Students from both universities have formed several stretcher teams, and many female students are actively learning first aid techniques. When the People's Liberation Army pursued and annihilated the defeated enemy from the western suburbs to Beiping in mid-December, the Tsinghua student stretcher team rescued wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They applied medicine, bandaged the wounds, and transported them back to their units. The students are also preparing to go among the workers and peasants to carry out propaganda and organizational work, so as to support the People's Liberation Army in overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang together with them.

　　燕京、清华两大学充满新气象
  　师生争读毛主席著作
  　热烈参战支援人民解放军
    【新华社平津前线九日电】北平西郊解放后，燕京、清华两大学充满了新气象。燕大除因战争情况在去年十二月十四日停课一天外，十五日起即照常上课。当十四日解放军先头部队进抵燕京校门外时，他们轻轻敲门，对里面同学说：“我们是人民解放军，是来保护你们的，请你们不要害怕。”里面的同学们亲切回答说：“我们不怕！”旋即纷纷涌出校外，与其他各校学生争相探望人民解放军。十九日，解放军某部政治部主任刘道生同志至该校讲演时，大礼堂内挤满了狂欢的听众。同学们迫切要求学习新的知识，五百余留校同学已自动编成四十个学习小组，研究“新民主主义论”及“论联合政府”等书。燕大学生自治会曾召开“认识新社会”的座谈会，三百余同学参加座谈，为该校半年来最盛大的一次座谈会。教授们也自由组成四个组，分别研究时事、新的教育制度等问题。清华大学在十二月二十九日开课。清华校务仍由以前的“防护委员会”主持。“防护委员会”系由教授会、学生自治会、职员公会、工役校警联合会等五单位所组成。现在校学生计一千八百五十余人，他们在学生自治会领导下展开了新的学习运动，各级会大量翻印了“新民主主义论”等书，以供同学阅读。张贴在“民主墙”上的“清华时报”，刊载着人民解放军胜利的消息，经常吸引着排成长列的读者们。许多教授自动组成学制研讨委员会，研究改进学制的方法。除学习研究之外，同学们又热烈讨论如何配合局势参加革命工作的问题。两校同学组成了若干担架队，许多女同学积极的学习救护技术。当十二月中旬解放军由西郊追歼溃敌至北平城下时，清华同学担架队即曾救护了解放军的伤员，他们给伤员上好了药，扎好了伤口，且抬送归队。同学们还准备到工人农民的群众中去进行宣传组织工作，以便和他们共同支援人民解放军打倒国民党反动统治。
