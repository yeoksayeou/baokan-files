    Using the Excuse of "Developing Industry and Commerce," Qixian North Gate Does Not Allow Laborers to Stay in Inns
    On January 2nd, when carts from the Shangfukou area of the Fifth District of Fanxian County returned from transporting military grain, they stayed at the North Gate of Qixian County. When the carts arrived at the inn, the innkeeper refused to allow them to stay. The cadre leading the carts went to the Qixian Town Public Office to negotiate with the innkeeper. The comrade working in that district said, "The higher authorities have instructed us to develop industry and commerce, and laborers are not allowed to stay in inns because staying in inns hinders the development of industry and commerce." As a result, all the carts had to move out of the inn and stay on the street. The weather was cold and the night was dark, and the laborers had many complaints. I believe that using the excuse of "developing industry and commerce" to prevent laborers from staying in inns is wrong and should be immediately checked and corrected.

　　借口“发展工商业”齐河北关不让民夫住店编辑同志：
    一月二日，范县五区上浮口运军粮的大车回来时，住到齐河县北关。车驶到店里时，店主不准住，带大车的干部同店主到齐河城镇公所去交涉，该区工作同志说：“上级叫发展工商业，不准民夫住店，住店妨碍工商业发展。”这样，大车又全都驶出店来，住到大街上。天寒夜冷，民夫意见很多。我认为这样借口“发展工商业”不让民夫住店是不对的，应即检查改正。
