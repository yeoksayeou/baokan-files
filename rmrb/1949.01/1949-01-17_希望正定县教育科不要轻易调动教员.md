　　Criticism and Suggestions

　　Hoping the Zhengding County Education Section Will Not Casually Transfer Teachers
　　Since I came to the Fifth District of Zhengding to teach, it has only been nine months, and I have seen most of the teachers discussing all day long that the transfers are too frequent, which makes the teachers' thinking turbulent and affects the education work. Of the more than 30 teachers in the district, only five or six have not been transferred this year (including two who did not obey the transfer); half of them have been transferred three times; and even five times (such as Yang Zhihong). Some teachers asked the County Education Section why they were transferred, and the answer was due to work needs, poor public feedback, and poor relations with village cadres. In this way, many teachers lost confidence in running the school well, worked timidly, perfunctorily, and wasted time. They felt their status was low, and individual teachers had the intention of changing careers. Therefore, the education work in the Fifth District always ended in failure whenever a meeting resolution was made. Such casual transfers are worth examining.

### 希望正定县教育科不要轻易调动教员

　　希望正定县教育科不要轻易调动教员
    我到正定五区任教员以来，不过九个月，见到大部教员整天议论着说调动太频繁，使教员思想动荡不定，教育工作受到影响。该区教员三十余名，今年未调动的不过五六名（内有二名是不服从调动）；调动三次的占二分之一；甚至还有五次的（如杨志洪）。有的教员问县教育科为什么调，回答是工作需要、群众反映不好及与村干关系不好。这样，很多教员失掉办好学校的信心，工作上束手束脚，敷衍了草，混了一天少两晌。感到地位低，个别教员抱着改行调业的意思。因此五区的教育工作，每次开会决议，都落个虎头蛇尾。这样的轻易调动，值得检讨。
