　　Developing Individual Strengths to Organize Sideline Occupations
  　Nanzhuang Village Earns Nine Shi of Rice Daily
    [Taiyue Telegram] Since Nanzhuang Natural Village, under the Xiacun Administrative Village of the Third District of Jincheng County, finished harvesting autumn crops on November 18th, cadres have organized the masses to transition into winter production. Based on the village's production conditions, they have developed various skill-based specialties to engage in sideline production. Cadres personally went to factories and obtained 20,000 New Currency units to organize a group of livestock to transport sand to the factories, earning 35 yuan per cartload. They also organized a group of livestock to deliver coal to the furnaces, making four trips a day, also earning 35 yuan per cartload. A total of 93 livestock were organized, earning 3,200 yuan daily, enough to buy 4 shi and 6.5 dou of rice. Furthermore, 14 workers at the square furnace earned 35 yuan per person daily, totaling 490 yuan, enough to buy 7 dou of rice. Seventeen workers at the coal kiln earned 0.5 dou of rice per person daily, totaling 8.5 dou of rice. Three blacksmith shops with nine workers earned 1 dou of rice per person daily, totaling 9 dou of rice. Eighteen basket weavers earned an average of 0.5 dou of rice per person daily, totaling 9 dou of rice. Five carpenters, some doing odd jobs, others making boxes for factories, earned 0.5 dou of rice per person daily, totaling 2.5 dou of rice. Eighteen porters and transporters earned an average of 0.5 dou of rice per person daily, totaling 9 dou of rice. Two mat weavers earned an average of 0.3 dou of rice per person daily, totaling 0.6 dou of rice. In addition, there was one oil mill and two flour mills, employing a total of 11 people, two people making tofu, and three workers weaving towels, totaling 16 people, earning an average of 0.3 dou of rice per person daily, totaling 4.8 dou of rice. The entire village earned a total of 9 shi and 6.4 dou of rice daily. After deducting the daily feed for 93 livestock (1 dou per livestock) and the food for the carters and 192 workers (1 dou of rice per person daily), totaling 3 shi and 8.1 dou of rice, there was still a surplus of 5 shi and 8.3 dou of rice, enough to feed 583 people daily, at a rate of 1 dou of rice per person.
