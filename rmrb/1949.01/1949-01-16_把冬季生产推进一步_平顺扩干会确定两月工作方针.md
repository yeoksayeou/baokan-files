　　Further Advance Winter Production
  　Pingshun Enlarged Cadre Meeting Defines Two-Month Work Plan
    [Taihang News] Pingshun County convened a county-wide enlarged cadre meeting on December 21st to study the promotion of winter production, combined with democratic Party consolidation and the resolution of remaining issues. First, groups were divided by district for discussion to review winter production. It was believed that production achievements in this period were not significant. After the conclusion of land reform, the masses showed high enthusiasm for production. Many villages had made remarkable achievements, but their organization showed weakness, and the remaining issues from the conclusion of land reform were not resolved thoroughly enough. The main reasons were the short time frame and heavy workload, coupled with unclear thinking among cadres who were busy completing military conscription tasks, leading to a relaxation of leadership in production. After the review, Comrade Chen Yushan, Secretary of the County Party Committee, reported on the work guidelines and tasks for January and February of 1949. The general guideline was: "Review and summarize the conclusion of land reform, resolve remaining issues, promote systematic democratic Party consolidation, and pay attention to leading production at the same time." After the report, combined with documents, the key points of the District Party Committee's winter production propaganda and the "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Socialism" were studied. Based on different situations and the allocation of cadres, it was decided to conduct Party consolidation in batches in conjunction with production. The first batch included thirty villages, the second batch forty-one villages, and the third batch sixty-three villages. Out of the county's one hundred and eighty villages, one hundred and thirty-four villages would be completed in January and February. Twenty-two villages had already undergone consolidation this spring, and the remaining twenty-three villages could not be consolidated. The steps for Party consolidation in the first batch of villages were divided into five steps. The first step started with a review of winter production, inspecting the implementation of policies and the operational guidelines of cooperatives, and specifically organizing winter production. The second step involved conducting criticism and self-criticism within the Party to improve the ideological understanding of Party members, and implementing education outside the Party to make the masses realize the necessity of Party leadership, and electing representatives of the masses to prepare to participate in the branch general meeting. The third step was to convene a branch general meeting with the participation of mass representatives, carry out criticism and self-criticism, representatives put forward opinions, distinguish right from wrong, make self-criticism for what is right, and explain what is not right. The fourth step was to convene a mass meeting to evaluate cadres and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses. The fifth step was to build the Party and government. In the second batch of villages, before the arrival of the work team, the first step of work was carried out, inspecting and resolving the remaining issues of land reform, organizing winter production, summarizing education, and laying the foundation for Party consolidation. In the third batch of villages, propaganda and education were organized in winter schools, and remaining issues were inspected. When the first batch of villages was nearing completion, special personnel could be drawn to the second batch of villages to do preparatory work. In order to strengthen Party leadership and ensure the correct implementation of Party policies, Comrade Chen Yushan of the County Party Committee made a report on organizational discipline and made self-criticism. The conference adjourned on the 30th, and the County Party Committee immediately went to various districts and villages to provide specific assistance and guidance. (County Party Committee Office)

　　把冬季生产推进一步
  　平顺扩干会确定两月工作方针
    【太行讯】平顺县于十二月二十一日召开全县扩干会议，研究推动冬季生产，结合进行民主整党并解决遗留问题。首先以区为单位分组讨论，检查冬季生产，认为这一段生产成绩不大，群众在结束土改后生产情绪很高，有不少村已做出显著成绩，但组织起来表现无力，结束土改遗留问题解决的不够彻底。主要原因是因时间短任务重，再加上干部思想不明确，忙于完成参军任务，对生产领导放松。检讨后，县委书记陈玉山同志报告一九四九年一、二两个月的工作方针与任务，总的方针是：“检查总结结束土改，解决遗留问题，推向系统民主整党，同时注意领导生产。”报告后结合文件联系实际学习了区党委冬季生产宣传要点，农业社会主义问答等文件，并根据不同情况与干部的配备，确定结合生产分批进行整党。第一批三十个村，第二批四十一个村，第三批六十三个村。全县一百八十个村，一、二两个月完成一百三十四个村，今春已整过二十二个村，下余二十三个村整不了。第一批整党村进行步骤共分五步，第一步从检查冬季生产入手，检查政策的执行和合作社业务方针等，具体组织冬季生产。第二步在党内进行批评与自我批评，提高党员思想认识，在党外贯彻教育，使群众认识必须有党的领导，选出群众代表准备参加支部大会。第三步召开有群众代表参加的支部大会，开展批评与自我批评，代表提出意见，分清是非，对的检讨，不对的解释。第四步召开群众大会评选干部密切干群关系。第五步建党建政。在第二批村在工作组未到达前，进行第一步工作，检查解决土改遗留问题，组织冬季生产，总结教育，为整党打基础。第三批村组织生产在冬学进行宣传教育，检查遗留问题。第一批村在最后快结束时，可抽专人到第二批村做准备工作。为加强党的领导，保证党的政策正确执行，县委陈玉山同志对组织性纪律性作了报告并作了自我检查与批评。大会于三十日散会，县委随即分头深入各区村作具体帮助指导。　　（县委办公室）
