[Reported by this newspaper] The North China Youth Representative Conference was held last month, attended by over a hundred representatives and guests from various regions of North China and cities such as Beiping and Tianjin. The conference summarized the experience of experimental league building over the past two years, determined the guiding principles and tasks of the Youth League in the North China region going forward, and specified concrete methods and steps for league building. Bo Yibo, Nie Rongzhen, Liu Lantao of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Feng Wenbin of the Youth Work Committee of the CPC Central Committee, all attended and delivered speeches and guidance. Commander Nie pointed out in his speech that North China youth had played a great role in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the two-plus years of the People's Liberation War. Many young people had been tempered into outstanding heroes in battle. In the future, youth work within the North China People's Liberation Army should be strengthened, and Youth League organizations should be established to unite and educate the young commanders and fighters in the North China People's Liberation Army, so as to give greater play to their role in the revolutionary war. He further pointed out that the entire young generation shoulders the glorious task of liberating the people and safeguarding the interests of the people, and the Youth League should lead young people to study military affairs, strengthen their bodies, establish youth organizations for military training, actively mobilize young people to participate in the war and join the army, and support the front. It should also pay attention to learning scientific and technological knowledge, improve culture, participate in various construction undertakings of New Democracy, and become active fighters of the Chinese people.

Comrade Bo Yibo's speech, after analyzing the military and political situation in which Chiang Kai-shek could be basically defeated nationwide in about a year, specifically explained the issue of New Democratic economic construction. He pointed out that the route of economic construction should be based on the development of the state-owned economy as the mainstay, the universal development and close reliance on the cooperative economy of the masses, the support and transformation of the small commodity economy, and the permission and encouragement of the private capitalist economy, but it is necessary to prevent and oppose all speculative manipulation in the private capitalist economy that is harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood. He particularly pointed out that this direction of New Democratic economic construction is also the direction of the Youth League's work. To build a new society and ensure that young people have a good and happy life, the Youth League must unite, educate, and organize the vast number of young people to work together to participate in various economic construction projects of New Democracy.

Comrade Liu Lantao clearly pointed out in his speech the position and style that young party members engaged in Youth League work should have. He called on young party members to stand firmly on the proletarian stand in the youth work posts, and to clarify the principled differences between the various ideas of the proletariat and other classes. Regarding the issue of style, he called for a combination of adhering to principles and having full enthusiasm. Finally, he pointed out that the situation of national victory has made the scope of youth work broader, and we have the important responsibility of educating all young people. Every party member must become a docile tool of the Party and the people. The victorious future of the Chinese revolution is the future of our youth workers. Some comrades believe that youth work has no future; this is a selfish calculation and a wrong idea.

Xu Shiping, of the Youth Work Committee of the North China Bureau, reported that in the past two years, more than 500 Youth League branches in rural areas, factories, and schools have been established throughout North China, with a total of about 20,000 league members. They have played a huge role in leading and uniting the vast number of young people to join the army, participate in the war, develop production, carry out land reform and democratic construction, and promote cultural undertakings, and have been greatly loved by the masses. He further pointed out that league building must follow the mass line to be successful; formalism and impatience are wrong; narrow-minded sectarianism is also wrong.

Xu Shiping put forward different tasks for the Youth League in various regions, based on the characteristics of different regions.

　　1. Rural youth movement and league building work: Especially after the land reform, carrying out production education and cultural education, carrying out production mutual aid organizations, and establishing cooperatives, in order to ensure that the majority of farmers can produce and prosper and live a wealthy life; and enriching the cultural life of the masses and improving the cultural and political level of young people are the fundamental tasks of Youth League members in rural areas. Youth League members must first ensure that they are good laborers. Organize and lead young people to participate in cooperative mutual aid organizations. Secondly, it is necessary to organize and carry out young people's political and cultural learning movements and cultural activities. At the same time, in order to better exert the active role of young people in participating in the war and joining the army, it is also necessary to conduct frequent war and current affairs education.

　　2. The work of young workers and the tasks of the league in factories and various enterprises: In state-owned and public enterprises and factories, the main task is to improve production. To this end, the first is to improve the political consciousness of young workers, establish new labor attitudes, and consolidate labor discipline. The second is to carry out the movement to respect teachers and love apprentices, and organize and lead young workers to learn technology and culture, and improve scientific knowledge and skills. Third, proper attention should be paid to the welfare of young workers, and young people should be trained to become excellent workers with healthy bodies. In private enterprises and factories: First, under the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, unite young workers and apprentices, and under the laws and decrees of the People's Government, carry out necessary and appropriate struggles to protect their basic interests and legitimate rights. Organize and raise class consciousness. Second, it is necessary to abolish feudal oppression of apprentices, improve the relationship between teachers and apprentices, and work hard to learn. Third, strive to produce for the construction of a new society.

　　Youth League members in the working class should actively complete the tasks put forward by the administration and the trade union under the unified leadership of the Party. At the same time, in order to more fully mobilize young workers and take care of the special requirements of young workers, in addition to regularly sending representatives to participate in trade union work, the trade union should set up a youth workers' department to strengthen the work of young workers and the league. The league should establish a solid foundation among the working youth masses.

　　3. The task of the student movement and the league in schools is to consciously strengthen learning, improve culture and politics, unite teachers and students, build schools, and ensure the correct implementation of the school's education policy and plan.

　　4. In cities with many students in the new district, the first priority should be to win over, educate, transform, and unite students, intellectuals, and cultural and educational workers as the focus of the youth movement, help them establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and mobilize them to study hard or participate in various work in the liberated areas. The start of student work in the new district should be to help schools resume classes and stabilize the order of study. Then, political and cultural education should be carried out step by step.

　　The youth work in the rural areas of the new district is to mobilize young people to participate in the entire mass movement, mobilize and organize poor and hired youth to unite with middle peasant youth, and win over other youth. Strengthen education, raise awareness, and cultivate activists in the struggle. Depending on the situation, general and active youth organizations can be organized first, such as peasant association youth groups, representative meetings, and literacy classes. After the youth masses have been sufficiently mobilized, league building work with a focus can be carried out.

Chen Jiakang, a representative of the All-China Youth Federation from the Liberated Areas, who had just returned from the World Federation of Youth, also attended the meeting and reported on the status and tasks of the Chinese youth movement in the international youth movement.

At the meeting, experiences in league building in various regions were exchanged, and representatives from Dingxian County, Xinle County, Zhengding Middle School, and Shijiazhuang factories made typical reports.

Group discussions and plenary reports were combined. The representatives not only understood the spirit and line of league building, but also increased their experience and improved their work enthusiasm.

Comrade Feng Wenbin's conclusion summarized the questions raised by everyone, answered them, and further explained that the basic task of the New Democratic Youth League is to systematically study Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly educate its members and youth masses from revolutionary practice. At the same time, it should organize the vast number of youth masses in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to actively participate in various movements called for by the Communist Party and the People's Government.

Finally, all the representatives unanimously resolved to establish a preparatory committee for the New Democratic Youth League of the Liberated Areas, and proposed to the Youth League organizations of all the Liberated Areas of the country to immediately establish a preparatory committee for the National Youth League, in order to convene the first representative conference and unify the leadership of the national league.

The conference elected Lu Ping, Xu Shiping, Yang Zejiang, Liu Guohua, Li Xin, Li Chang (army), Wang Zonghuai (army), Song Ding (female), Xia Qing (female), Kang Tuo (cultural circles), Wang Feng (Beiping), He Jingzhi (school), Tian Baifang (worker), Qi Yiding, Ma Jie, Meng Xiande, Tian Guang, Qin Yuping, Peng Hua, Jiang Yi, Li Chen, Luo Feng, Zhao Yuting, Zhou Guoxi and other twenty-five people as preparatory committee members of the North China New Democratic Youth League. And Lu Ping, Xu Shiping, Yang Zejiang, Liu Guohua, Li Xin, Qi Yiding, Song Ding, Wang Feng and other nine people were elected as standing committee members, with comrades Lu Ping and Xu Shiping serving as secretary and deputy secretary respectively.

　　华北举行青年代表会议
  　总结建团经验确定方针任务
  　选出陆平等廿五人为青年团筹备委员
  　青年要过幸福生活必须努力参加建设
  　根据不同地区特点提出团的不同任务
    【本报讯】华北青年代表会议于月前召开，到会有华北各地区及平津等城市代表及来宾百余人。大会总结了两年来试验建团的经验，确定了今后华北区青年团的方针任务，及建团的具体方法步骤。中共中央华北局薄一波、聂荣臻、刘澜涛、中共中央青委冯文彬等同志均亲临讲话与指导。聂司令员讲话中指出：华北青年在八年抗战和两年多的人民解放战争中，起了伟大的作用。许多青年在战斗中锻炼成为出色的英雄。今后应加强华北人民解放军内的青年工作，建立青年团的组织，团结教育华北人民解放军中的青年指战员，以便更大的发挥其在革命战争中的作用。继指出：整个青年一代，肩负着解放人民，保卫人民利益的光荣任务，青年团应领导青年学习军事，锻炼身体，建立军事训练的青年组织，积极动员青年参战参军，支援前线。并应注意学习科学技术知识，提高文化，参加新民主主义的各种建设事业，成为中国人民的积极战士。
    薄一波同志的讲话，于分析了再有一年左右时间，就可在全国范围内基本上打败蒋介石的军事政治形势之后，专门讲解了新民主主义经济建设的问题，他指出：经济建设的路线，是应以发展国营经济为主体，普遍地发展并紧紧地依靠群众的合作社经济，扶助与改造小商品经济，容许与鼓励私人资本主义经济，但要防止与反对私人资本主义经济中一切有害于国计民生的投机操纵的成份。他特别指出，这个新民主主义经济建设的方向，同时也是青年团的工作方向。要建设一个新社会，要保证青年们有美好的幸福的生活，青年团就必须团结教育和组织广大青年来一齐努力参加新民主主义的各种经济建设。
    刘澜涛同志讲话中明确指出做青年团工作的青年党员应有的立场和作风。他号召青年党员在青年工作岗位上要站稳无产阶级立场，要明确无产阶级和其他阶级各种不同思想的原则区别。关于作风问题，他号召要坚持原则与满腔热情相结合。最后指出：全国胜利的形势，使青年工作范围更加宽广了，我们有教育全体青年的重大责任，每个党员都要成为党和人民的驯服工具。中国革命胜利的前途，就是我们青年工作者的前途，某些同志认为青年工作无前途，这是个人主义打算，是错误的想法。
    华北局青委许世平同志报告：两年来全华北已建立了约五百多个农村、工厂、学校青年团的支部，共约两万团员，他们在领导和团结广大青年参军、参战、发展生产、土地改革及民主建设和文化事业中，起了极大的作用，并受到群众极大的爱护。继指出：建团要走群众路线才能建好，形式主义与急性病是错误的；狭隘关门主义同样也是错误的。
    许世平同志根据不同地区特点，提出了各地区青年团的不同任务。
    一、农村青运与建团工作：特别是在土地改革之后，开展生产教育与文化教育，进行生产互助组织，建立合作社，以保障大多数农民能生产发家，过富裕的生活；与丰富群众的文化生活，提高青年的文化政治水平，乃是青年团员在农村的根本任务。青年团员首先要保证自己是个好的劳动者。组织与带动青年参加合作互助组织。其次要组织与开展青年在政治上、文化上的学习运动及文化活动。同时，为了更好的发挥青年在参战、参军中的积极作用，还要经常的进行战争与时事教育。
    二、在工厂中和各种企业中青年职工工作与团的任务：在国营与公营企业工厂中主要是提高生产。为此，第一是提高青工政治觉悟，树立新的劳动态度，巩固劳动纪律。第二是开展尊师爱徒运动，并组织与领导青年职工学习技术文化，提高科学知识技能。第三适当的注意青工福利事业，把青年培养成为有健康身体的优秀工人。在私营企业工厂中：第一在发展生产劳资两利的方针下，团结青年工徒，在人民政府的法令之下，为保障自己的基本利益与合法权利，进行必要与适当的斗争。组织起来，提高阶级觉悟。第二必须废除对学徒的封建压迫，改善师徒关系，努力学习。第三为新社会的建设努力生产。
    工人中的青年团员应在党的统一领导下，积极完成行政与工会所提出的任务。同时为了更完满的发动青工，照顾青工的特殊要求，团除应经常派代表参加工会工作外，工会中应设青工部，加强青工及团的工作。团应在劳动青年群众中建立巩固的基础。
    三、学生运动与学校中团的任务，是自觉的加强学习，提高文化、政治，团结师生，建设学校，保证学校教育方针与计划的正确执行。
    四、在新区学生多的城市中，首先应将争取、教育、改造、团结学生，知识分子，文化教育人员做为青运重点，帮助他们树立革命的人生观，发动他们努力学习或参加解放区的各种工作。新区学生工作开始应是帮助学校复课，稳定学习秩序。然后再有步骤的进行政治、文化教育。
    新区农村中的青年工作，是发动青年参加整个群运，发动与组织贫雇青年团结中农青年，争取其他青年。加强教育，提高觉悟，培养斗争中的积极分子。根据情况，可先组织一般性的与积极分子的青年组织，如农会青年小组，代表会及识字班。在青年群众有了相当发动后，再进行有重点的建团工作。
    刚从世界青联回来的中国解放区青联代表陈家康同志，亦莅会报告目前中国青运在国际青运中的地位和任务。
    会上进行了各地区建团经验的交流，定县、新乐县、正定中学、石市工厂等地代表分别做了典型报告。
    小组讨论与大会报告结合进行。代表们不仅了解了建团的精神与路线，还增加了经验，提高了工作热情。
    冯文彬同志结论中综合大家提出的问题，予以解答，并进一步说明：新民主主义青年团的基本任务，在于有系统的学习马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，从革命实践中不断地教育自己的团员和青年群众，同时应当以马克思列宁主义的精神组织广大青年群众积极的参加共产党和人民政府所号召的各种运动。
    最后，全体代表一致决议：建立解放区新民主主义青年团筹委会，并向全国各解放区的青年团组织提议，迅即成立全国青年团的筹委会，以便召开第一次代表大会，统一全国团的领导。
    大会选出陆平、许世平、杨泽江、刘国华、李新、李昌（军队）、王宗槐（军队）、宋仃（女）、夏青（女）、康濯（文化界）、王峰（北平）、贺敬之（学校）、田百方（工人）、齐一丁、马杰、孟宪德、田广、秦雨屏、彭华、蒋毅、李晨、洛风、赵雨亭、周国玺等二十五人为华北新民主主义青年团筹备委员。并选出陆平、许世平、杨泽江、刘国华、李新、齐一丁、宋仃、王峰等九人为常委，陆平、许世平同志分任正副书记。
