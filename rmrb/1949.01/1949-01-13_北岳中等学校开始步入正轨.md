　　After the North Yue District relayed the decisions of the North China Secondary Education Conference, all schools immediately reorganized and improved their work in accordance with the new guidelines. According to a preliminary inspection by the Education Department of the District Administrative Office, the schools have begun to get on the right track, and some noteworthy issues have been discovered, which are reported as follows: 1. Adjusting Classes Based on Proficiency: In order to implement the standard school system, each school first adjusted classes according to students' cultural proficiency. Students with too low a proficiency were assigned to remedial classes. Jí Jìn Middle School and Chahar Middle School, for the convenience of teaching, also divided students in the same grade into different classes based on their proficiency. All students aged eighteen and above in each school were placed in short-term middle school classes. In addition, there are normal school classes, etc. 2. Revising Curriculum According to Guidelines: Each school revised its curriculum based on the principle of strengthening cultural learning and the prescribed courses, which was greatly supported by students. For example, students at Zhengding Middle School reflected: "What we learn in half a year now is equivalent to what we learned in the past year." Students at Chahar Middle School study consciously and actively, and their progress is faster than ever before. However, because students' general proficiency is low, teachers compile a large amount of their own teaching materials. Teachers do not have much past teaching experience, their teaching methods are not able to be easily understood, and in order to catch up with the curriculum progress, they disregard whether students can digest the material, with a purely task-oriented viewpoint. Therefore, many students feel that "the homework is very heavy" and difficult to digest. 3. Faculty and Staff Work Hard in Teaching and Delve into Professional Knowledge: After the implementation of the new guidelines, the faculty and staff of each school have made their best efforts to study teaching methods. Teachers, generally encouraged by the new guidelines, strive to strengthen classroom teaching and self-study guidance. For example, Chen Hanzhang, an arithmetic teacher at Chahar Middle School, and the research on teaching methods in history, geography, and mathematics at Zhengding Middle School have achieved considerable results. Some teachers, after strengthening classroom teaching, feel that their own proficiency is low and their work is difficult, and deeply feel the importance of strengthening their own cultural and professional learning. The Education Department will also strengthen its leadership in the future to improve current teachers. 4. Students Work Hard in Learning and Voluntarily Form Mutual Aid Groups: After the implementation of the new guidelines, students at each school work hard in learning, and the atmosphere of learning is extremely strong. Although the focus is on individual self-study, many collective mutual aid learning organizations have spontaneously emerged in each school. In addition to self-study, there are student-led voluntary learning organizations, such as the wall newspaper, music, and literature groups at Chahar Middle School, and the lecture meeting of Class 14 at Jí Jìn Middle School, all of which are more effective because they are freely and voluntarily combined. However, some students have the problem of overworking, studying desperately without rest or play, which still needs to be corrected.

### 北岳中等学校开始步入正轨

　　北岳中等学校开始步入正轨
    北岳区自华北中等教育会议决定传达下去后，各校随即按照新的方针整顿改进学校工作，据该区行署教育处初步检查，各校已开始步入正轨，并发现一些值得注意的问题，特报导如下：一、根据程度，调整班次：各校为了执行正轨学制，首先根据学生文化程度，调整了班次，程度太低的学生则编为补习班。冀晋中学与察哈尔中学并为便利教学起见，将同一年级的学生亦根据程度不同分别编班。各校凡年满十八岁以上的学生，都编入短中班。此外并有师范班等。二、依照方针，改订课程：各校均依据加强文化学习的方针与规定课程改订了课程，得到学生极大拥护。如正定中学学生反映：“现在学习半年，顶住过去一年”；察哈尔中学学生自觉自动的学习，其进步之快，前所未有。但由于学生一般程度较低，教员自编教材分量较大，教员过去教授经验不多，教授方法不能深入浅出，为赶课程进度，不顾学生能否消化，有单纯完成任务观点，因此许多学生感到“功课压的很”不易消化。三、教职员努力教学，钻研业务：新方针实施后，各校教职员均尽最大努力钻研教导方法，教员普遍的在新方针的鼓舞下，努力加强课堂教学及自习辅导。如察哈尔中学算术教员陈汉章以及正定中学关于史地数学教学方法的研究等，都有相当成绩。有些教员在课堂教学加强后，感到自己程度低工作困难，深感必须加强自己文化业务学习的重要。教育处今后亦即将加强其领导，以提高现任教员。四、学生努力学习，自愿结成互助：各校自实行新方针后，学生均努力学习，学习空气异常浓厚，虽然是着重个人自修，但各校均自发的出现了许多集体互助的学习组织，自习以外并有学生自愿结合的学习组织，如察哈尔中学的墙报，音乐、文艺小组，冀晋中学十四班的讲演会等，均因系自由自愿的结合，收效较大；但有的学生则有用功过度，不休息不游戏的拼命学习的毛病，还须注意纠正。
