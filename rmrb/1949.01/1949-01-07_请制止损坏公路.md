Criticism and Suggestions

　　Please Stop Damaging the Highway
    The Shipo Road (from Shimen to Bozhen) is one of the main transportation arteries in North China. Recently, passenger and freight transport on the Shipo Road has been increasing, and the number of public and private rubber-wheeled vehicles has also gradually increased.

    Since the liberation of Shimen, the road has been damaged by iron-wheeled carts, especially in recent months. The road is often found to be uneven and in a chaotic state, full of potholes. It is still somewhat passable when the weather is clear, but if it rains, it becomes muddy and difficult to travel. Not only rubber-wheeled vehicles but even pedestrians cannot find a path to walk on; when rubber-wheeled vehicles try to pass, they only skid.

    Even worse, some iron-wheeled carts, caring only for themselves, pass on the road after it rains, making the road even worse.

    The Jizhong Motorcade has hired workers to repair the road several times, but the iron-wheeled carts show no concern for its upkeep, rendering the repairs ineffective. The laborers have also lost confidence in repairing the road due to the constant damage.

    The personnel responsible for road maintenance in Jizhong often encounter explanations. Villagers and private transport operators listen, but some units of our organs and troops, as well as some state-owned transportation departments, not only do not listen but also respond with dismissive remarks: "You have no jurisdiction over this section. We have no instructions from higher authorities..." Similar situations occur repeatedly (the Jizhong Motorcade has encountered this many times), and the personnel responsible for road maintenance dare not intervene due to their strong attitude.

    It is hoped that the leaders of various organs, troops, and state-owned transportation departments will educate those in their units who have committed such acts to prevent them from happening again.　Jizhong Motorcade

　　请制止损坏公路
    石泊路（石门至泊镇）是华北主要交通干线之一，近来石泊路的客货运输日益增多，公、私营的胶轮车往返运输也渐增。
    石门解放后该道路即被铁轮大车所轧，尤其近几月来更经常发现，把公路轧得坑洼不平，乱七八糟。天晴时还好些，假使一下雨，泥泞难行，别说胶轮大车连单人也找不出一条可走的路来；胶轮车一走，光在地上打滑。
    更有的铁轮大车光为自己毫不顾一切的在雨后的路上通行，这样使路更加坏了。
    冀中汽车队曾雇民工修过几次，但铁轮大车毫无爱护之心，因之也等于无效；民夫对修路因屡次轧也没有信心了。
    冀中负责护路的人不时碰上解释，村民及私人运输还听，但有个别我机关部队与一些公营运输部门，他不但不听反而拿话气人：“你们管不着这一段，我们上级没有指示……”。类似这类情形，不断发生（冀中汽车队曾遇此事多次），负责护路人员也因他们态度强硬不敢管。
    望各机关、部队、公营运输部门的首长们对你处如有发生此事件者应给以教育以防再犯了。　冀中汽车队
