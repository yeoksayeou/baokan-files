Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The Shandong Provincial Democratic Government, regarding the treatment of families of officers and soldiers who revolt within the liberated areas according to the standards for revolutionary military families, has issued a notice to all subordinate levels of government to abide by it. The full text of the notice is as follows: "Now, according to the East China Military Region's suggestion to this government: 'For troops who revolt and join the People's Liberation Army, from the date of the revolt, the families of their officers and soldiers shall be considered revolutionary military families and shall enjoy the treatment of revolutionary military families within the liberated areas; those whose lives are truly difficult should be given appropriate care according to the Regulations on Preferential Treatment.' Based on this, upon investigation, all officers and soldiers of the revolting troops have joined the People's Liberation Army, and their families are therefore revolutionary military families. After receiving official notification and proof from the troops regarding their families, governments at all levels should register them as revolutionary military families and notify the families themselves. According to the Outline Land Law of China, the New Area Rent Reduction Decree, the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Revolutionary Military Families, and all current democratic government laws and regulations, social treatment should be given to military families according to their actual circumstances. Those whose lives are truly difficult should be given appropriate care according to the Regulations on Preferential Treatment. This notice."
