　　Suggestions on the Work of Reforming Old Operas
    A Discussion on the Reform of Old Operas
    Wang Kejin
    Old opera is a product of feudal society, serving the feudal dynasties, the aristocratic scholar-official class, and acting as an educational tool for their policy of fooling the people. However, it has a long history, and its certain value cannot be denied. Our purpose in reforming old opera is to liberate it from feudal poisoning and make it serve the masses of the people.

    If we cannot correctly understand the historical value of old opera, we cannot propose the issue of the direction of its development; making professional old opera performers feel depressed, thinking that reforming old opera is to reduce programs, rendering their years of hard-earned art useless, even thinking that they have no future. They cannot improve ideologically, making them consciously demand the reform of old opera, but only passively respond to the reform from the point of view of executing orders. Our comrades who are promoting the reform of old opera only emphasize criticizing the bad plots of old opera. The old is negated, but the new cannot be produced. In the process of the alternation of the new and the old, we are too eager, pointing fingers in many ways, without pointing out the direction to the old performers, and as a result, the problem cannot be solved. I think that certain operas imported from foreign countries in big cities, and the low-level yangko operas in rural areas, cannot meet the needs of the broad masses of the country. Therefore, the construction of new opera is neither "imported" nor "created" out of thin air, but is basically to receive the historical heritage. Old opera still has a future after the reform, and its direction of development is China's new opera.

    Recently, we have a tendency to deny the "roles" in old opera, and this issue is also worth discussing. Speaking of roles, because they have a high artistic level and are welcomed by the masses; the psychology of the masses is not to love watching the plot of a certain play, but to love listening to a certain role. Therefore, if new opera is to replace old opera, and even the new opera of the future, "roles" are still very important. Therefore, to reform old opera performers, we must make them realize that their years of hard-earned art will not be wasted, and they themselves realize that they have a future for development, in order to inspire them to consciously demand the reform of old opera. Empty talk about opposing the purely artistic point of view cannot solve the problem.

    To oppose the feudalism of old opera, it is inevitable to oppose orthodox ideas. However, in our work of reforming old opera, there is an orthodox concept. For example, for historical dramas of the Three Kingdoms period, we do not pay attention to making the "Yellow Turban bandits" of the peasant movement orthodox, and we do not promote the tactical thinking of combining wisdom and courage well; instead, we criticize Guan Yu and make Cao Cao righteous. The people suffered from the war in the struggle for power among the Three Kingdoms of Shu, Wei, and Wu. Instead of regarding the chaotic wars of the Three Kingdoms as a gang of jackals eating the bones of the people, we should distinguish who is orthodox, which has no educational significance for the masses. Another is the ideology of Han chauvinism. China is a multi-ethnic country, and we still consider it natural for the Han nationality to rule the foreign nationalities. When foreign countries invade, we scold them. This kind of drama has a certain value in promoting narrow nationalism during the Anti-Japanese War (Editor's note: This view is wrong). Now that we are about to win a nationwide victory and establish a joint government of equal nationalities, it is not of much benefit to vigorously promote Han chauvinism again. Furthermore, we mechanically turn the plots of old opera upside down: for example, we mechanically regard Huang Tianba, a fabricated character in the novel *Shi Gong An*, and Zeng Guofan, a real-named person who "suppressed the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," as the same kind, calling Huang Tianba the most reactionary traitor. Zeng Guofan opposed the people's revolutionary movement; Huang Tianba opposed the tyrants who had large estates, hired a large number of thugs, and bullied the people. However, we regard these tyrants as revolutionary masses, mechanically treating these tyrants as the heroes of Liangshan. The masses have a bad reaction to it. Novels like *Shi Gong An* are performed as dramas, mainly to watch a complete set of martial arts, which has no artistic value. Therefore, in our work of reforming old opera, it is irresponsible and harmful to the audience to modify it crudely without painstaking research on old opera. We must pay attention to the study of political theory and historical knowledge in our work of reforming old opera.

    The so-called old opera refers to the opera containing feudal elements, and whether it can be performed or not mainly depends on the degree of influence of its poison. The scripts we newly created that are educational for the masses of the people are called new operas, and the operas that have been reformed to serve the masses of the people should also be called new operas. In the general concept, it is believed that all operas performed in the old form are called old operas, which will confuse the boundary between new and old operas.

　　对改造旧剧工作的建议
    关于旧剧改革问题的讨论
    王克锦
    旧剧是封建社会的产物，是为封建王朝、贵族士大夫阶级服务，作为他们行愚民政策的教育工具。但它有悠久的历史，不能否认其有一定的价值。我们改造旧剧的目的，是要把它从封建毒害中解放出来，为人民大众服务。
    我们如不能正确认识旧剧的历史价值，就不能提出旧剧的发展方向问题；使职业化了的旧艺人，感觉苦闷，认为改造旧剧，就是裁减节目，使自己多年苦练的艺术变成无用处，甚至想到将来无前途，在思想上就不能提高，使其自觉的要求改造旧剧，只是被动的，以执行命令观点去应付改造。我们推动改造旧剧的同志，只强调批评旧剧剧情坏。旧的否定了，新的产生不出来。在新旧交替过程中，求之过急，多方面指责，没有给旧艺人指出方向，结果解决不了问题。我想大城市中某些在外国搬来的歌剧，农村中艺术较低的秧歌剧，都不能满足全国广大群众需要。所以建设新歌剧既不是“舶来”，又不是凭空“创造”，基本上要接收历史遗产。旧剧经过改造后还是有前途的，它的发展方向就是中国的新歌剧。
    最近我们有否认旧剧“角色”的倾向，这个问题也值得讨论。说到角色，因为他有较高的艺术水准，为群众所欢迎；群众的心理，还不是爱看某一部戏的剧情，而是爱听某一个角色。所以新剧要代替旧剧，甚至将来的新歌剧，“角色”仍很重要。所以改造旧艺人，要他们体会到他们苦练多年的艺术不会荒废，他自己认识到有发展前途，才能启发他自觉要求改造旧剧。空谈反对单纯艺术观点是解决不了问题的。
    反对旧剧的封建主义，必然要反对正统思想。但我们改造旧剧工作中，却存在了正统观念。如对三国时代的历史剧，我们对农民运动的“黄巾贼”不去注意使之成为正统，对智与勇结合的战术思想没很好发扬；而去批判关羽，把曹操正派化。蜀魏吴三国争权，人民受战争涂炭，不去把三国混战看作吃人民骨头的一丘之貉，而去辨别谁是正统，这对群众没啥教育意义。另外是大汉族主义思想，中国是一个多民族的国家，汉族统制异族，我们仍然认为理之当然。番邦入寇就唾骂起来，这种剧在抗日期间宣传狭隘的民族主义，有它的一定价值（编者按：这个观点是错误的）。现在我们要在全国胜利，成立各民族平等的联合政府，如果再着力宣传大汉族主义是没啥好处的。再就是机械的把旧剧戏情翻倒过来：如把施公案小说的杜撰人物黄天霸和真名实姓“剿太平天国”的曾国藩机械地看作一类，叫黄天霸是最反动的叛徒。曾国藩反的是人民革命运动；黄天霸反的是家有大庄院、雇有大批打手、欺民采花的霸徒。而我们却把这些霸徒看成革命的群众，机械地把这些霸徒与梁山泊好汉一样看待。群众看了反起了坏作用。施公案一类的小说演成剧，主要是看一套全武行，没啥艺术价值。因此，我们在改造旧剧工作上，不下苦心研究旧剧，粗率的去修改，是对观众不负责，对观众有害的。我们改造旧剧一定要注意政治理论和历史知识学习才行。
    所谓旧剧是指含有封建主义成份的剧，能演与否主要决定于他毒素的影响程度。我们新创造的对人民大众有教育意义的剧本叫新剧，经过改造为人民大众服务的剧也应叫作新剧。一般人的观念中，认为凡以旧形式演出的都叫旧剧，这会混淆新旧剧的界线。
