  　  I. First Satisfy the Most Pressing Needs of the Youth

　　The Da Xing Textile Factory in Shijiazhuang has more than 820 employees, 369 of whom are young people, with female youth workers accounting for two-thirds. The most youth are in the Engineering Department, accounting for about five-sixths of all the factory's youth workers. Before liberation, most were illiterate, so their desire to learn culture was very high. After liberation, they first accepted the political and cultural education of the trade union, and their political awareness was generally improved. Female youth workers generally have simpler thoughts and accept new ideas faster. Most of the youth workers in the technical department are male workers, the vast majority are skilled workers, and their cultural level is relatively high. However, they were deeply deceived and蒙蔽ed during the enemy and puppet regime, and most of them were still unwilling to ask about politics after liberation, and they also brought many bad habits from the old society, so ideological transformation requires a process.

　　Based on this situation, before establishing the League, we ran a youth worker cultural literacy class, divided into three classes, mainly targeting young workers in the Engineering Department, in order to unite the broad masses of young workers, discover activists, and cultivate League building objects.

　　Initially, only five or six workers in each class participated in the study, but in less than ten days, each class gradually increased to more than 30 people. At the beginning, we focused on learning literacy, speaking, current affairs, singing, collective games, storytelling, and discussion meetings. They felt a great interest, and naturally accepted political education. In a month and a half, it developed to more than 130 people. Due to repeated enlightenment and explanation of the importance of political study and the development of the Liberation War in the literacy class, the workers automatically requested to strengthen political study. We selected "Opposing Liberalism" as the course of the cultural class and combined it with the actual production situation to review it, gradually improving the workers' political awareness.

　　II. Publicizing, Brewing, and Discussing the Establishment of the League

　　Based on this progressive situation of the young workers, we gradually introduced the nature and tasks of the Communist Youth League and launched publicity among the young workers. We organized workers who had finished their shifts to listen to the League building reports made by Comrade Feng Wenbin and Comrade Peng Hua from the Municipal Youth Committee, and also introduced the situation of the League building in various schools and the Railway Bureau in Shimen. After listening to the reports, they raised various questions for answers. The timing for establishing the League gradually matured, so we launched a discussion in the literacy class. Everyone proposed conditions for striving to join the League, such as not running the car in the workshop, not偷瞌睡 (stealing naps), and working actively, and asked the production administrator to assist in the inspection. On July 1st, the literacy class held a symposium for young workers, with more than 250 young workers attending to discuss the issue of League building. At the meeting, the workers spoke actively and made guarantees for themselves. In August, enemy planes bombed Shimen wildly, and the two or three-li-long air-raid shelter in the factory was washed away by the rain. The trade union called on the workers to re-excavate it. The literacy class responded first, guaranteeing the participation of all. In addition, a large number of activists emerged in the work of sewing慰劳 bags for the trade union, binding textbooks for all the factory workers, and regularly keeping the classroom clean. The vast majority of them hoped to strive to join the League.

　　III. Conditions are Ripe, Publicly Establish the League

　　From the beginning of the literacy class in early June to the end of August, after three months of publicity, brewing, and discussion, the conditions for establishing the League were ripe, so it was decided to formally establish the League. Four League members (three workers and one staff member) were developed first, and a five-member League Committee was formed to carry out the League building work under the leadership of the Municipal Youth Committee and the Party Branch. All League building work should be promoted by activists under the leadership of the League Committee as much as possible. The result of publicly building the League dispelled many of the workers' doubts and mysterious feelings about the League.

　　During this period, we also held two symposiums. The first was a general symposium including staff and workers, inviting the factory director and the director of the trade union to speak, and the Municipal Youth Committee explained the meaning and content of the League to expand the League's influence. The second was to convene activists to hold a symposium to discuss the conditions for joining the League, and taking specific facts and specific people in production as examples, we summarized the conditions for League members as: 1. Actively engage in production; 2. Study diligently; 3. Have a correct work style; 4. Unite and love each other. The general condition is to be willing to fight to the end for the realization of new democracy.

　　On September 1st, the provisional League Committee was formally established. According to the specific conditions of each production unit, it absorbed League members using different methods of self-reporting and public discussion and individual development, and announced the application procedures for joining the League and discussed the draft of the League Constitution. In order to suit the special conditions of the factory, the draft also specifically stipulated: "The program of this League is to strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, unite all the factory's young workers and staff to actively engage in production, and strive for the thorough realization of industrial construction and the new democratic New China." The obligations of League members also clearly stipulate: "Respond to various calls from the administration and the trade union, and play an exemplary role in production and study."

　　IV. Hold an Admission Ceremony and Invite League Members' Parents to Attend

　　Before approving League members, the following two tasks were carried out:

　　I. Talk to the applicant who is estimated to be likely to join the League, reminding him to pay attention to his work style and strengthen ties with the masses. II. Talk to the applicant who is estimated to be temporarily not qualified to join the League, focusing on explaining the proper attitude for applying to join the League, and encouraging them to work hard to improve themselves in the future to strive to join the League. Thus, a total of 33 League members were absorbed in two batches.

　　On October 1st, the formal establishment meeting of the League was held, and the formal League Committee was elected. At the establishment meeting, we invited the League Committee's parents to participate and speak, changing the parents' views on the Communist Youth League. The League Committee also specifically proposed the slogan "League members should help their parents, brothers, and sisters-in-law with chores at home and be a good son and daughter." Fan Runlin, the parent of a League member, said at the meeting that the Communist Youth League is an organization that educates young people, and he hopes that the League and the League member's family will cooperate to educate young people.

　　The League member's oath is taken in a combination of collective oath and individual oath, because an individual oath can enable a League member to express his efforts and hopes for the League in front of the masses, which is very effective for his personal progress and influence on other young people.

　　V. The Role Played by the League in Various Works

　　In terms of production: At the first group meeting, each League group in each production unit discussed how to ensure that work is carried out in accordance with the standards proposed by the factory without any slight偷巧 (cheating), and unite non-League members to do the same. In the car group competition, League members were scattered in each car group, uniting non-League members to strive for model status for their car group. In the three-month competition summary, the only car group that won the championship three times in a row was the one led by League member Li Shuyan. And League members who received red flags accounted for two-thirds of the number of League members in that department. Non-League members who were not very active in the past were motivated, and some even worked harder and competed with League members. During the most tense air raids, many workers were absent from work or asked for leave, but not a single League member was absent. League member Li Shuyan also persuaded the people in the same car group in the air-raid shelter not to ask for leave because of fear, and advised them to return to the factory to drive and produce as soon as the alarm was lifted. Many heroic deeds were created by these young people of the new China.

　　In terms of learning: League members must participate in the trade union's study every day, and each group and branch is responsible for checking. At the same time, each League member must unite two non-League members to participate. League members are also responsible for helping others learn. In September, most of the League members served as study group leaders of the trade union, teaching workers to read and write. League members with higher cultural levels also served as cultural teachers in the primary class. The person in charge of the Communist Youth League served as the work of the club and other studies.

　　In terms of completing administrative and trade union tasks: sewing慰劳 bags, responsible for the venue layout of each factory meeting, guaranteeing the number of attendees at each municipal gathering, and storming every parade or the launching and specific affairs of the conference.

　　In terms of war preparation: In October, Fu Zuoyi's bandit army attempted to attack Shijiazhuang, and all the factory's staff and workers rose up to prepare for war. This was a good test for the newly established Communist Youth League and its members. Under the threat of enemy planes, before the factory decided to stop work, of the 47 League members, except for three who evacuated to the countryside with their families before the suspension of work, no one left their posts. On the night of stopping work and dismantling the machines, all the League members who had already worked for eight hours continued to work for another eight hours, and the female League members also stubbornly completed their tasks. When the situation was tense, male League members Liu Changming, Li Yuande, and others automatically took up guns to stand guard, and almost all the male League members escorted the machines at night. Bian Yongxing and others did not sleep well for three days while dismantling the machines. Liu Changming's leg originally had problems, but he still escorted the car all night, and the car went the wrong way, so he hurried to chase it back. When the factory ordered the transfer, except for two League members who were unable to get rid of their families and stayed in Shimen, all the remaining League members resolutely obeyed the factory's decision and evacuated to the countryside, most of whom also assumed certain work tasks.

　　In summarizing the war preparation, 12 worker League members won awards, and one cadre League member received special commendation. No League member was criticized or punished.

　　During the war preparation, a large number of activists emerged, the workers' awareness improved, and 20 workers applied to join the League before the resumption of work. The League Committee approved 19 people (including 6 who applied before the war preparation). Now the number of League members totals 66, including 27 male League members and 39 female League members (staff members account for 11, and workers account for 55), accounting for about one-sixth of the total number of young workers in the factory.

　　After the resumption of work, the League Committee convened a meeting to summarize the war preparation and celebrate the first anniversary of the liberation of Shimen, and invited the League members' families to participate. At the meeting, the League members sincerely reviewed themselves.

　　The war preparation educated the workers, and after the League passed this test, it further gained the trust and support of the masses and took another step forward!

　　大兴纱厂的青年团
    大兴纱厂青年团团委会
  　一、首先满足青年当前最迫切的要求
    石家庄市的大兴纱厂，共有八百二十多个职工，青年占三百六十九人，其中女青工占三分之二。工务部的青年最多，约占全厂青工的六分之五。在解放前，大都是不识字的，所以学习文化的要求很高。解放后最先接受了工会的政治与文化教育，政治觉悟普遍的提高了。女青工的思想多较单纯，接受新思想较快。技术室的青工多半是男工，绝大多数是技术工人，文化程度较高，但他们在敌伪统治时代所受欺骗蒙蔽较深，解放后多数仍不愿问政治，而旧社会不良习气带得也多，所以思想改造需要一个过程。
    根据这种情况，我们在建团之先，以工务部青工为主要对象，办了一个青工文化补习班，共分三班，借以团结广大青工，发现积极份子，培养建团对象。
    最初参加学习的工人每班只五六个，但不到十天每班逐渐增加到三十余人，开始着重学习识字、讲话、时事、唱歌、集体游戏、讲故事、讨论会等，他们感到很大兴趣，这样也自然地接受了政治教育，在一个半月内共发展到一百三十余人。由于在补习班内一再启发和讲解学习政治的重要和解放战争的发展，工人自动要求加强政治学习，我们就选了“反对自由主义”作为文化课的课程，并结合实际的生产情况来作检讨，逐渐提高了工人们的政治觉悟。
    二、宣传、酝酿、讨论建团
    根据青工们这种要求进步的情况，我们便逐渐介绍了青年团的性质和任务，在青工中展开了宣传，组织下了工的工人去听冯文彬同志和市青委彭华同志所作的建团报告，还介绍了石门各学校和铁路局先后建团的情形，听讲以后纷纷提出各种问题来要求解答。建团的时机逐渐成熟，于是就在补习班里展开了讨论，每人提出了在车间不跑车，不偷瞌睡，积极工作等作为争取入团的条件，并请了生产管理员协同检查。七月一日，补习班开了一个青年工人座谈会，到会青工二百五十余人，讨论建团问题。在会上，工人们纷纷发言，给自己做了保证。八月间敌机狂炸石门，厂内二三里长的防空壕被雨冲塞了，职工会号召工人重新挖掘，补习班首先作了响应，保证全体参加；此外在替职工会缝慰劳袋，装订全厂工人课本，经常保持教室清洁等项工作中，也涌现了大批积极份子，他们绝大多数都希望能争取入团。
    三、条件成熟，公开建团
    自六月初开办补习班至八月底止，经过了三个月的宣传酝酿和讨论，建团条件已经成熟了，于是便决定正式建团，先发展了四个团员（工人三人，职员一人），组成了五人的团委会，在市青委及党总支领导下，展开建团工作。一切建团工作尽可能地通过积极分子在团委领导下去推动。公开建团的结果，使工人们消除了许多疑虑和对团的神秘感觉。
    在这期间，我们又曾举行过两次座谈会。第一次是包括职工的普遍性座谈会，邀请厂长、职工会主任讲话，又由市青委讲解团的意义和内容，以扩大团的影响。第二次是召集积极分子举行讨论入团条件的座谈会，并以生产中的具体事实及具体人物为例，总结出团员的条件为：一、积极生产；二、学习努力；三、作风正派；四、团结友爱。总的条件是愿为新民主主义的实现奋斗到底。
    九月一日，临时团委会正式成立，根据各生产单位的具体情况，用自报公议与个别发展的不同方法吸收团员，并宣布申请入团手续和讨论团章草案等。为了适合工厂的特殊情况，草案中又具体规定了：“本团纲领以努力学习毛泽东思想，团结全厂青年职工积极生产，为发展工业建设，争取新民主主义新中国的彻底实现而奋斗”。团员的义务中也明确规定为：“响应行政及职工会的各种号召，在生产中、学习中起模范带头作用。”
    四、举行入团仪式邀请团员家长列席
    在批准团员以前，进行了以下的两件工作：
    一、与估计可能入团申请人谈话，提醒他注意自己的工作作风，并加强与群众联系。二、与估计暂时不够入团条件的申请人谈话，着重说明申请入团的应有态度，今后应努力提高自己争取将来入团。于是两次共吸收了三十三个团员。
    十月一日举行团的正式成立大会，选举产生了正式的团委会，在成立大会时。我们邀请了团委家长参加和讲话，改变了家长对青年团的看法。团委并特别提出“团员在家庭应帮助父母兄嫂做活，做一个好子弟”的口号。团员家长范润霖在会上讲话说，青年团是一个教育青年的团体，他希望团与团员家配合起来教育青年。
    团员宣誓是采取集体宣誓和个别宣誓结合的方式，因为个别的宣誓能使一个团员在群众面前说出自己的努力方向，和对团的希望，对他个人进步和给其他青年的影响是很有效的。
    五、团在各种工作中所起的作用
    在生产方面：各生产单位团的小组在第一次小组会上，就讨论了如何保证按照厂方提出的标准法工作，不作丝毫偷巧，并且团结非团员也如此做。在分车竞赛中，团员们分散在各车中，团结非团员为自己的车争取模范。在三个月的竞赛总结中，会场唯一连得三次锦标的就是团员李淑砚领导的那一车。而青年团员得到红旗的占该部团员人数的三分之二。平常不很积极的非团员被带动了，一部分还加劲干和团员竞争着。空袭最紧张的时候，不少工人旷工或请假了，但团员中没有一个人缺过席。团员李淑砚在防空壕里，还说服了同车的人，不要因害怕请假，劝他在警报一解除马上回厂开车生产。不少英雄事迹是这样地被这些新中国的青年们创造出来了。
    在学习方面：团员们每天必须参加职工会的学习，各小组各支部负责检查，同时每个团员还必须团结两个非团员参加。团员们还负着帮助旁人学习的责任。在九月份里，团员多半担任着工会的学习小组长，教工人识字、写字，文化较高的团员还担任了初级班的文化教员，青年团的负责同志担任了俱乐部和其他学习的工作。
    在完成行政和职工会的任务方面：缝慰劳袋，负责每一次厂内大会的会场布置，保证每一次参加市内各种集会的出席人数，突击每一次游行或大会的发动及具体事务工作。
    在备战方面：十月，傅作义匪军妄图偷袭石家庄，全厂职工奋起备战；对于这个新生的青年团及其团员是一个很好的考验，在敌机的威胁下，厂方还没有决定停工以前，四十七个团员中除了三个在停工前随家庭疏散下乡以外，其余没有一人离职。在停工拆卸机器的那一夜，已经工作了八小时的全体团员们再继续工作了八小时，女团员也顽强地完成了任务。当情况紧张时，男团员刘长明、李元德等自动拿枪站岗，男团员几乎全数在夜里押运机器。边永兴等在拆卸机器中三天没有睡好觉，刘长明的腿原来有毛病，他还押车走了一通夜，车走错了路，他连忙去追回来。当厂方下令转移时，团员中除了两名未能摆脱家庭留居石门外，其余全体均坚决服从厂方决定，疏散下乡，其中大部分人还担任了一定的工作任务。
    在总结备战时，工人团员十二人得了奖，干部团员一人受特别表扬，团员中没有一人受到批评和处分。
    在备战中大批积极分子涌现出来了，工人觉悟提高了，二十名工人在复工前即申请入团，团委批准了十九名（包括备战前申请的六名）。现在团员人数共计六十六人，内男团员二十七名，女团员三十九人（职员占十一人，工人占五十五人），约占总厂青工的六分之一。
    复工后团委会召开了一个总结备战和庆祝石门解放一周年的大会，请了团员家属参加，会上团员们诚恳地检讨了自己。
    备战教育了工人们，而团经过这次考验以后，进一步的得到了群众的信任与拥护，更向前迈进了一步！
