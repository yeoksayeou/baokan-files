　　Song Lingge, a Model Worker on the Front Lines
　　Jun Qian
　　Comrade Song Lingge is the head of the mimeograph section of a certain column's directly subordinate unit and a Communist Party member. Because of his infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, and his hard work, he became the number one among the 174 meritorious models of the entire directly subordinate unit. Now, let me introduce his exemplary deeds.
　　Last April, the troops were stationed in the Jinqiao Village area of Anyang, carrying out both military offensives and political offensives against the enemy, and it was necessary to immediately print a batch of "KMT Soldier Reception Certificates" to call on the enemy troops to lay down their weapons. This printing task needed to be completed immediately. However, that day, section member Su Runqing was sick, and the scribe had also gone to see a play. Although the number of characters on this reception certificate was not large, it was very difficult to typeset and print, requiring four plates to be typeset, and a novice would not be able to do it. He resolutely took on the task himself, carved four plates, and printed four times, starting at 5:00 p.m. and finishing at 8:00 a.m. the next day. He worked from dusk till dawn, printing a total of 1,125 copies. Because it required four plates, it was actually equivalent to printing 4,500 copies, and a blister the size of a melon seed appeared on his palm.
　　During marches, although the mimeograph section's belongings were carried by porters, he always carried the steel plates or a kerosene bottle, or helped the porters carry the loads. On October 16th, the troops departed from Qianmin Village in Qi County for Qimen. He marched with the troops for a day. When he arrived at the north bank of the Yu River in Qimen, waiting to cross the river, everyone was sweetly resting after a day of fatigue. Coincidentally, at that time, news of the great victory of recovering Jinzhou and annihilating 100,000 enemies was received, and it was necessary to quickly spread it to enhance the confidence of the people in the new area and encourage the fighting spirit of the troops. At that time, the Propaganda Department assigned the task of immediately printing this good news, as well as the work of printing the propaganda points for the new area, to the mimeograph section. Song Lingge did not hesitate at all because of the day's marching fatigue. He immediately borrowed a house from a merchant, assigned the work of writing and printing the propaganda points for the new area to the section members, and carved the plate for the good news himself. In the middle of the night, this work was not finished, and the troops crossed the river to Qimen for camping. After crossing the river, everyone went to rest, but he continued to do his unfinished work until dawn, completing the task. After breakfast, he marched again, and camped in Shipogu, Yanjin in the evening. Just as he was about to sleep, he suddenly received the urgent task of rushing to print grain borrowing certificates for the new area. Song Lingge still sacrificed a night's sleep without any difficulty and completed the task in time.
　　During the three days of stationing troops in Zhao Liudian, in order to complete the work of printing combat reports and a letter from the column party committee to Communist Party members and all commanders and fighters, as well as good news, etc., Song Lingge not only worked hard during the day except for eating and going to the toilet, but also stayed up for two entire nights. Before the march, the task was completed satisfactorily. His hard-working style deeply moved people and spread throughout the entire directly subordinate unit.
　　From August 3rd to October 30th, from Chengzhai in Hua County to Liugudi in Huojia, during this period, Song Lingge and his section members, in addition to marching, had to work 10 to 12 hours a day, or even 14 to 16 hours. This kind of intense work was not stipulated by anyone; it was just that revolutionary enthusiasm encouraged them to do so spontaneously. Because he poured all his energy into revolutionary work, he did a lot of selfless things: One day, Song Lingge, who was busy writing on the steel plate, was thirsty. He asked the communications soldier to fetch boiling water. The communications soldier scooped a bowl and placed it in front of him. He forgot to drink it, and as a result, a bowl of hot water turned into cold water. The communications soldier changed it for him, but he still forgot to drink it and it turned cold again. This happened three times. From then on, the story of three bowls of boiling water turning into cold water became a popular anecdote throughout the entire directly subordinate unit.
　　The high intensity work eroded his health, and his brain gradually started to ache, but he was unwilling to say it. Whenever he had a headache due to intense work, he would only secretly purse his lips and continue to work as usual. After the liberation of Ji County, his brain pain became even worse. The pain even caused problems with his eyes. When it was severe, he saw the wax paper as a black blur. His memory also deteriorated. He couldn't remember a sentence after reading it and could only read and write one word at a time. Each time, he would rest quietly for a while before continuing to work. At night, his head would swell so much that he didn't know how big it was, and he couldn't sleep, tossing and turning. It wasn't until he fell ill that everyone learned about this situation. Section member Su Runqing asked him, "Why didn't you say you were sick earlier?" His answer was this: "I was afraid that if I said it, it would affect the mood of others and cause losses to the work!"
　　Does Song Lingge only bury himself in hard work? No. Not only did he use his exemplary role to move everyone, unite everyone, and promote work, but he also paid attention to the ideological education of the entire section, grasping every link in the work and implementing the Party's call into practical work. For example, after October 20th, the troops moved frequently, marching during the day and working at night, and had worked for two consecutive nights. Everyone was exhausted, and on the third day, they suddenly received the urgent task of rushing to print good news and notices. Because everyone was unable to rest, although they didn't say it, they expressed their displeasure with silence. In this situation, Song Lingge did not force them to work. He gathered everyone together and said, "Come! I'll read a letter to everyone!" He read the letter from the column committee to Communist Party members and all commanders and fighters, and then said, "Since the Autumn Offensive, the victory has been so great. Although we are busy and tired, we must work hard and compare ourselves to the frontline soldiers," and other words, which immediately opened up everyone's minds. Everyone gladly gave him a clear, simple, and forceful reply: "Work!" So, those who wrote wrote, those who printed printed, and the task was completed smoothly.
　　In the mimeograph section, apart from him having skilled techniques, the other comrades were all novices. Song Lingge, on the one hand, attached importance to his own professional learning, formulating a professional learning plan, and on the other hand, patiently helped other comrades to progress. After two or three months of hard work, the novices had all progressed to the point where they could work independently, and even the communications soldier Zhang Tingwen had learned to write and print, and had been trained to achieve remarkable results.
　　Although Song Lingge often worked until midnight, he strictly adhered to the daily morning study system, except in very special circumstances. At meetings, he also seriously used the spirit of criticism and self-criticism to solve the problems that occurred in the section's work and life, so that everyone was united and happily worked hard for the Party's work.
　　Under the leadership of Song Lingge, in the first evaluation of merits and selection of models in the column's directly subordinate unit, not only did he win the glorious title of the number one among the 174 meritorious models, but all five comrades in the section also became meritorious models.

　　前线工作模范宋麟阁
    君谦
    宋麟阁同志是某纵直属队的油印股长，共产党员。由于他对党对人民有无限忠诚，艰苦奋勉，成为全直属队一百七十四名功臣模范中的第一名。现在介绍一下他的模范事迹。
    去年四月，部队驻在安阳金桥庄一带，一面进行军事进攻，一面对敌展开了政治攻势，需要立即印一批蒋匪军官兵招待证，以号召匪军放下武器。这个印刷任务，需要马上完成。可是那天股员苏润清病了，缮写员也看戏去了，这个招待证虽然字数不多，因为要印得精美，套四次版，缮印起来极费劲，非生手所能胜任。他就毅然一人承担起来，刻制了四个版，套印了四次，从下午五时动手，至次日早八时才完工。闹了个两头见太阳，共印了一千一百二十五份。因为是套四次版，实际上等于印了四千五百份，他手心磨出来一个瓜子一般大的水泡。
    行军时，油印股的东西，虽然有挑运员担着，可是他总是背着钢版或提着煤油瓶子等东西，或帮助挑运员挑担。十月十六日部队从淇县迁民村出发往淇门，他随部队行军一天，到了淇门御河北岸，等着过河，一天疲劳之后，大家都甜蜜的休息起来。巧得很，当时收到了收复锦州、歼敌十万的伟大胜利消息，需要赶快传播出去，提高新区人民的胜利信心，鼓舞部队的战斗意志。当时宣传部将立即印发这个捷报的任务交给了油印股，还有印发新区宣传要点的工作。宋麟阁毫没有因为一天的行军疲劳而犹豫，立即在一家商号借了房子，把写印新区宣传要点的工作，分配给股员，他自己刻制捷报版，半夜的时候，这一工作没有做完，部队又渡河到淇门宿营，过了河，大家都去休息了，他又继续做他那未完的工作，一直到天明时，完成了任务。早饭后又行军，晚上宿营于延津石婆固，正拟睡觉，忽又接到赶印新区借粮证的紧急任务，宋麟阁仍毫无难色的牺牲了一夜的睡觉，将任务及时完成。
    在赵刘店驻军三天，宋麟阁为了及时完成印战斗报和纵队党委给共产党员及全体指战员的一封信，及捷报等工作，不但白天除了吃饭和小便外，都在紧张的工作，并且还熬了两个整夜。行军之前，任务圆满的完成了。他这种艰苦作风，深深感动了人们，响亮的传遍了全直属队。
    八月三日至十月三十日，从滑县的程砦至获嘉的刘固堤，在这期间，宋麟阁和他的股员们，除了行军外，每天要工作十小时至十二小时，甚至十四小时到十六小时，这样紧张的工作，并不是谁给他们规定的，那不过是革命热诚鼓励着他们，他们自发的这样做罢了。正由于他把全副精力倾注到革命工作上，他就做出来不少忘我的事情：某日，正在紧张赶写钢版的宋麟阁渴了，他叫通信员打了开水来，通信员舀了一碗放在他的面前，他忘记了喝，结果一碗热水变成了凉水，通信员给他换了一碗，仍因为忘喝又变成了凉的，就这样热水变凉水重复了三次。从此三碗开水变凉水，便成为全直属队的美谈。
    高度的紧张工作浸蚀着他的健康，他的脑子逐渐疼痛起来，但他不肯说出来，每当因紧张工作而头疼时，他只暗暗撇撇嘴，照旧的坚持工作。解放汲县后，他的脑子疼症更甚了，疼得连眼睛也出了毛病，厉害时望着腊纸一片黑，记忆力也坏了，看一句就记不住，只能看一字写一字，每次他总是静憩片时后，再继续干下去。夜晚胀得不知头有多大，辗转反侧的睡不着。直到他病倒后，大家才知道这个情况。股员苏润清问他：“你为什么有病不早说呢？”他的回答是这样：“我怕说了，影响别人的情绪，使工作受了损失！”
    宋麟阁光自己积极埋头苦干吗？不是的。他不但以自己的模范作用，感动大家，团结大家，推动工作，他还注意全股的思想教育，抓紧每一个工作环节，把党的号召贯彻到实际工作中去。如十月二十日后，部队移动频繁，白天行军，夜晚工作，曾连续两夜工作，在大家都已疲惫不堪，第三天突又来了赶印捷报和通报的紧急任务，大家因得不到休息，虽然没有说出来，却以默然不语表现出不乐来。宋麟阁在这个情况下，他没有强制工作，他把大家召集在一块，对大家说：“来！我念一封信给大家听听！”他将纵委给共产党员及全体指战员的一封信念了，又说：“在秋季攻势以来，胜利这样大，我们虽然忙，虽然累，我们要努力和前线战士比”等话，马上打通了大家的思想，大家都欣然给了他一个明确而简劲有力的答复：“干！”于是写的写，印的印，顺利完成了任务。
    油印股除他有熟练技术外，其他同志都是生手。宋麟阁一面重视自己的业务学习，制定了业务学习计划，一面循循善诱，很耐心的帮助其他同志进步。经过二、三个月的努力，生手都进步到能独立工作了，就是通信员张廷文也学习得能写能印，而且已锻炼得成绩大有可观了。
    宋麟阁虽然时常工作到半夜，可是对每天早晨的学习制度，除了十分特殊的情况外，他是严格遵守了。在会议上，他也认真的以批评和自我批评的精神，解决了股内工作上和生活上所发生的问题，使大家团结一致，愉快的努力于党的工作。
    在宋麟阁领导之下，纵直第一次评功选模时，不但他获得了一百七十四名功臣模范的第一名光荣称号，而且全股五名同志也都成了功臣模范。
