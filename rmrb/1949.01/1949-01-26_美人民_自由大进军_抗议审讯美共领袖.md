Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd—Reports from various sources: As the American reactionaries have begun an illegal "trial" of American Communist leaders in New York, the American Congress for Civil Rights in Washington launched a "Freedom Great March" with 5,000 demonstrators from all over the country to protest the reactionaries' attack on the people's democratic rights. At the mass meeting of the "Freedom Great March," Progressive Party Congressman Marcantonio delivered a speech stating that the demonstration in Washington proves that the American people are finally marching to defend their freedom. He emphasized the conspiracy of the trial of American Communist leaders, saying: "The people on Wall Street know that they must defeat the Communist Party in order for Fascism to succeed." But he pointed out that the American people have increasingly deeply understood the lessons learned from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy: "Never let domestic Fascism rule America." The program of the "Freedom Great March" also included a mass press conference of "Victims of the 80th Congress" hosted by black leader Paul Robeson. Robeson introduced to the masses the wife of black man Nicholson, who was assassinated for voting in last year's election, and other victims, denouncing the crimes of the American reactionaries. Before the "Freedom Great March," the Congress for Civil Rights convened a National Civil Rights Legislative Conference with 700 representatives, which, in addition to deciding to demand the cancellation of the federal court's prosecution of the American Communist leaders, also decided to demand the cancellation of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, etc.

　　美人民“自由大进军”
  　抗议审讯美共领袖
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：当此美国反动派在纽约对美共领袖开始非法“审讯”之际，美国人权保障大会在华盛顿发动了有来自全国各地的五千名示威者参加的“自由大进军”，抗议反动派对人民民主权利的进攻。在“自由大进军”的群众大会上，进步党众议员马肯托尼奥发表演说称：华盛顿的示威，证明美国人民终于在为保卫他们的自由而进军了。他着重指出审讯美共领袖的阴谋称：“华尔街的人们知道，他们必须打垮共产党，法西斯主义才能成功。”但是他指出：美国人民已日益深刻地懂得从纳粹德国和法西斯意大利得来的教训：“决不让国内的法西斯统治美国”。“自由大进军”的程序还包括由黑人领袖罗伯逊主持的“第八十届国会的牺牲者”的群众性记者招待会。罗伯逊向群众介绍因在去年大选中投票而遭暗杀的黑人尼可逊的夫人与其他受难者，控诉美国反动派的罪行。在举行“自由大进军”以前，人权保障大会召集了有七百名代表参加的全国人权保障立法会议，除决定要求取消联邦法院对美共领袖的起诉外，并决定要求取消塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法等。
