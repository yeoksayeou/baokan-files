In 1943, Hu Junming and his family from Beiliugu Village, Third District, Wei County, fled to Zhang Xixian's home in Xinse Village, Sixth District, Chengci County. Due to financial difficulties, they borrowed 250 yuan from Zhang Xixian. Not long after, Hu Junming betrothed his biological daughter to Zhang Xixian's eldest son. The Hu family's living expenses were all provided by Zhang. Four months later, the Hu family returned from Xinse Village, leaving their daughter at Zhang's home. Their daughter ran away twice, but was brought back by Zhang's family both times. They didn't marry until 1945. After that, she would ask to return to her parents' home once a month. Now, under the pretext of visiting relatives, she has gone back and refuses to return permanently. The man has asked her to come back three times, but she only says that she doesn't want to go back because it's too far from her parent's home. What should he do? Please provide an answer.

Answer: Why doesn't the woman return? Is it only because it is "far from home"? Or are there other reasons? The letter does not explain, and it is impossible to determine which party is at fault. The man can first invite relevant relatives from both sides and impartial people from the village to mediate. If mediation fails, he can file a lawsuit with the judicial authorities, requesting the woman to fulfill her cohabitation obligations. If the woman does not fulfill her cohabitation obligations without justifiable reason, the man can file for divorce.

　　妻子无故久留娘家不归　可请人调解或提起诉讼
    编辑同志：
    在民国卅二年，有魏县三区北留固村胡峻明全家人等逃在成磁县六区辛塞村张希贤家居住，后因生活困难，借张希贤洋二百五十元，没有多长时间，胡峻明便将其亲生女许配与张希贤之长子，胡家的生活费皆由张方负责供给，四个月后，胡家由辛塞返里，便将其女留在张家，其女曾二次逃跑，均被张家找回。至民国三十四年才结婚，其后在张家不过一月就要求回娘家一次。今借探亲之名回去，便永不回来，男方三次去叫，只说离家远不愿回去，这该怎么办？请给以答复是荷。

    答：女方为何不归？是否仅为“离家远”？或是还有其他原因，来信未能说明，男女两方究竟那方有过失，在此无从认定，男方可先邀请双方有关亲族及村中公正人士，从中调解；调解无效时，可向司法机关提起诉讼，请求女方履行同居义务，女方无正当理由而不履行同居时，男方可为离婚诉讼。
