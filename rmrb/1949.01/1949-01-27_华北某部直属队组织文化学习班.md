　　Cultural Study Class Organized by a Subordinate Unit of a Certain Unit in North China
    After learning about the educational level of each comrade, the subordinate unit of a certain unit in North China decided to form three classes, upper, middle, and elementary, for the cultural study of cadres, focusing on Chinese language and arithmetic. The first to be formed was the intermediate Chinese class, initially with 154 students, later increasing to 183. Soon, the elementary Chinese class was also formed, with a total of 85 students, and it officially started on January 6th. All the guards, communications, and service personnel in the organs with a relatively higher level of education participated in the study. The formation of the intermediate and elementary arithmetic classes is underway and will start soon.

    Since the beginning of the classes, everyone has shown a high level of enthusiasm for learning. If you pay attention, you can hear everywhere: "What is this word?" There are very few absences, especially in the guard company and the reception company, which have consistently maintained a record of no absentees and no tardiness. The Department of Health, the Department of Supply, and the Telecommunications Bureau, despite being the farthest away, have never been late. Comrades with a lower level of education show even greater enthusiasm, are humble and willing to delve deeper. The intermediate Chinese class has covered punctuation and some grammar and held a test. The elementary class has covered homophones with different meanings, words with the same form and meaning, and the phonetic alphabet. At the beginning, the intermediate Chinese class spent half the time on texts and half on grammar, but later, after understanding everyone's level and receiving feedback such as, "What is a transitive verb? I can't figure it out," the grammar instruction time was quickly adjusted to one-third, and the content was simplified as much as possible. Last week, responsible comrades from various units collected everyone's opinions, some saying: "The lectures involve historical and geographical issues that are too far-reaching," "The teachers don't lecture boldly and naturally enough," etc. After the teachers studied these opinions, they quickly made corrections and explained them to everyone.

　　华北某部直属队组织文化学习班
    华北××部直属队干部的文化学习，先了解了每个同志的文化水平后，就决定以国文算术两科来编成上、中、初、三个班。首先组成的是国文中级班，先有学生一百五十四名，后增加到一百八十三名。不久国文初级班也组成，全班共八十五人，已于一月六日正式开课。凡机关中文化较高的警卫、通信、勤务人员都参加了学习。算术的中初班正在编班，不日便可开课。
    自开课后，大家的学习情绪都很高。如果你留心的话，到处会听见：“这是什么词？”很少有上课不到的，尤其是警卫连，收容连始终保持一个人不缺课，一分钟不迟到，卫生部、供给部、电讯局路最远，也没有迟到过。文化低的同志的劲头更大，虚心而且肯钻。中级班的国文讲了标点符号和部分文法，曾举行过一次测验，初级班讲了同训异义字，形义相同字及注音字母等。在开始时，中级班的国文是一半讲课文一半讲文法，但以后明白了大家的程度，有人反映说：“什么是及物动词？闹不清。”便迅速地调整文法授课时间为三分之一，内容也力求比较简单。上周各单位负责同志曾搜集大家意见一次，有的说：“讲课时涉及史地问题太远。”“教员讲课不够大胆自然…”等。经教员研究后，即迅速改正并向大家说明。
