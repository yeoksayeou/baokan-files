　　Changzhi Organizes Farmers to Plant Pine Trees
    [Taihang News] The Changzhi County Government's Cooperative Section and Agriculture and Forestry Bureau have achieved great results in leading farmers to plant and maintain pine trees. There are many pine trees on Wulong Mountain and Laosong Mountain in the county. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the pine trees suffered great losses due to destruction and felling by the enemy and puppets, coupled with a lack of management. In order to restore and develop the mountain forest industry, the county specifically dispatched cadres at the beginning of this month to help district cadres organize farmers to carry out pine planting and maintenance activities. In the fourth district, a total of 30 villages and more than 500 farmers were organized. In Laosong Mountain, which is 20 miles long and 3 miles wide, covering approximately 30,000 mu and containing 300,000 pine trees, after five days of effort, more than 150,000 trees were maintained. Under the leadership of the Cooperative Section, Wulong Mountain also planted more than 44,000 pine trees. (Ma Lin)

　　长治组织农民栽松树
    【太行讯】长治县府合作科与农林局，领导农民栽松、修松，成绩很大。该县五龙山与老松山的松树甚多。抗战时由于敌伪的破坏砍伐，加上无人管理，松树受到很大损失。该县为恢复与发展山林事业，特于本月初抽出干部帮助区干，组织农民开展栽松、修松运动。在四区共组织了三十个村五百余农民，在长二十里、宽三里，约三万余亩、三十万棵的老松山里，经过五天的努力，共修理了十五万多棵。五龙山在合作科的领导下，也栽松树四万四千多棵。（马琳）
