Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. TASS reports: Izvestia's diplomatic observer comments on the dissolution of the Japanese parliament, stating that the Japanese government has announced the dissolution of parliament after implementing many anti-democratic measures. What is most peculiar is that this parliament was only dissolved after a vote of no confidence in the Yoshida government. The Japanese reactionary government and the American occupation authorities have entrusted the work of preparing for the new parliamentary elections to Yoshida—this old hand at reviving militarism, the leader of the most reactionary political party. During the election campaign, they are simultaneously intensifying their terrorist activities against various democratic parties, especially the Communist Party, which has consistently fought for the democratization of Japan. The blatant attack on the democratic rights of the Japanese people, and the replacement of behind-the-scenes instructions from the American occupation authorities to the Japanese reactionary government with direct orders from MacArthur, is due to the fact that, under the influence of events on the Asian continent (referring to the failure of American imperialism in China), the American ruling clique has decided to accelerate the transformation of Japan into an industrial factory in the Far East, or simply put, a military industrial and strategic base for American imperialism. The nine conditions for Japan's economic "revival" submitted by the US State Department and the War Department to the Japanese government on December 17 are aimed at realizing this plan of the American ruling clique. These conditions stipulate increased taxes and the freezing of wages, etc., placing the full burden of the Americanization of the Japanese economy on the shoulders of the Japanese working people. The observer stated that this policy cannot but arouse the protest and condemnation of all people who uphold peace and security, because it creates a situation favorable to warmongers in the Far East.

　　日本议会被解散
  　消息报发表评论
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：消息报外交观察家评论日本议会之被解散称，日本政府在实行许多反民主的措施以后，又宣布了解散议会。最特别的是：这次议会仅在对吉田政府投不信任票后才被解散。日本反动政府与美国占领当局已把筹备新议会选举的工作委托给吉田——这个复活军国主义的老手，最反动政党的首领。在竞选运动当中，它们同时加紧对各民主党派，首先是对一贯为日本民主化而斗争的共产党的恐怖行动。对日本人民民主权利的公然进攻，以及以麦克阿瑟直接命令的形式代替美国占领当局对日本反动政府的幕后指示，其原因是由于：在亚洲大陆事件（按系指美帝国主义在中国的失败）的影响下，美国统治集团决定加速将日本变为远东的工业工厂，或者简单地说，变成美帝国主义的军事工业与战略的基地。十二月十七日，美国国务院与陆军部提交给日本政府的日本经济“复兴”的九个条件，其目的乃在于实现美国统治集团的这种计划。这些条件规定增加赋税与冻结工资等等，把日本经济美国化的全付重担都放在日本劳动人民的肩上。观察家称：这种政策不能不引起所有拥护和平与安全的人民的抗议与斥责，因为它在远东造成了有利于战争贩子的情势。
