　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government's sham peace plot is becoming increasingly clear. TASS Shanghai, 26th: "The head of the American advisory group, General Barr, arrived in Japan on January 27th and held a military conference with MacArthur to discuss events in the Far East. On January 23rd, Barr visited Li Zongren and informed him of this matter. During the meeting with Li, Barr pointed out that Kuomintang followers should try to retain the ports of South China and that political methods and peace talks must be used to halt the People's Liberation Army's offensive." Reuters Shanghai, 24th: "This development on the peace front, coinciding with the large-scale troop movements in the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, indicates that the Kuomintang army in this area is rapidly redeploying in the face of sweeping political changes." The facts reported in these two news items once again show that the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, under American command, is using the false "peace" plot to gain breathing space, redeploy, and stage a comeback. According to reports from various foreign news agencies: The Kuomintang Central Political Committee, personally attended by pseudo-Acting President Li Zongren on the 24th, has decided that Kuomintang government personnel will continue to move south. The Kuomintang government has also notified foreign embassies in Nanjing that the Kuomintang government will cease operations in Nanjing next month and move to Guangzhou. All but a few senior personnel of the Kuomintang Executive Yuan have left Nanjing. The Kuomintang's Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Information Bureau, and Central News Agency have all carried out their final evacuation. The entire Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now left with only a telephone working, as all supplies and equipment have been moved away. When a part of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the 25th to debate whether to stay in Nanjing or join the flight south, order broke down. Many key cadres of the Kuomintang secret service have gone to Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces, and have been assigned to local administrative systems in these provinces, serving as county magistrates and other positions. A large number of Kuomintang remnant troops are being ordered to move south, and an increasing amount of weapons and supplies are flowing to South China. Kuomintang railway officials have been ordered to mobilize all wagons to "cope with unprecedented military needs." Yu Hanmou, Zhang Fakui, Xue Yue and other key Kuomintang military and political figures are discussing specific plans for the defense of South China. Kuomintang troops in Nanjing and Shanghai are conducting combat exercises and building fortifications. Tang Enbo, commander of the Kuomintang Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, and Zhang Yaoming, commander of the Nanjing Garrison, reaffirmed the fascist martial law on the 22nd, threatening to "carry out on-the-spot military law sanctions" (execute on the spot) against those who disrupt public order. Chen Cheng, who received orders from Chiang Kai-shek in Hangzhou and flew to Nanjing on the 22nd, is still in Nanjing, and his task is obviously to preside over military affairs. Kuomintang communication personnel are currently busy installing wireless telephones between Fenghua Xikou town, where Chiang Kai-shek is located, and Nanjing, to facilitate Chiang's direct command of operations in Nanjing from Xikou.

　　江南匪军作新布署
  　匪方人员物资继续南迁
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】南京国民党反动政府的假和平阴谋愈来愈是真象毕露了。塔斯社上海二十六日电称：“美顾问团团长巴大维一月二十七日到达日本，与麦克阿瑟举行军事会议讨论远东的事件。一月二十三日，巴大维曾造访李宗仁，将此事告知李氏。在与李氏会谈时，巴大维指出：国民党追随者们应设法保有华南各港，目前则必须用政治方法及和平谈判停止人民解放军的攻势。”路透社上海二十四日电称：“求和战线上的这一发展和京沪杭地区大军运动恰相同时，指明这一地区的国民党军正在席卷性的政治变化面前迅速重新布署。”这两则新闻所报导的事实，再一次表明了美国指挥下的南京国民党反动政府的假“和平”阴谋，是为了取得喘息时间，重新布署，卷土重来的目的。据各外国通讯社消息披露：二十四日伪代总统李宗仁亲自出席的国民党中央政治委员会已决定国民党政府人员继续南迁。国民党政府并已通知驻南京各外国大使馆：国民党政府在下月即将停止在南京办公，改于广州办公。国民党行政院除少数高级人员外，都已离开南京。国民党的国防部、外交部、新闻局、中央社都已实行最后总撤退，整个外交部由于物资装备皆已搬走，已只剩了一个电话机在工作。一部分伪立法委员二十五日开会争论留在南京还是参加南逃的时候，秩序大乱。国民党特务机关的许多主要干部都已前赴广东、广西、浙江、福建等省，并被派到这些省份的地方行政系统中，担任县长等职。大量国民党残余军队正奉令南开，愈益增多的武器物资流向华南，国民党铁路官员已被命令动员一切车皮“应付空前的军事需要”。余汉谋、张发奎、薛岳等国民党军政要员正洽商华南防务的具体计划。南京和上海的国民党军都在进行作战演习，并在增筑防御工事。国民党京沪杭警备司令汤恩伯和南京卫戍司令张耀明，二十二日重申法西斯戒严令，威胁要对破坏治安者“实行就地军法制裁”（就地枪毙）。在杭州接受了蒋介石的命令于二十二日飞往南京的陈诚，现仍在南京，其任务显然是主持军事。国民党交通人员现正忙于安置蒋所在的奉化溪口镇与南京间的无线电话，以便利蒋贼从溪口直接指挥南京的行动。
