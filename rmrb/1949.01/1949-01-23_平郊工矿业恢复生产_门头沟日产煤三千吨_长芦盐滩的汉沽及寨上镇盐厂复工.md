Xinhua News Agency, Suburbs of Beiping, 20th. After the liberation of the southwestern suburbs of Beiping, the local industry and mining have successively begun to resume production, and the railway has been partially opened to traffic. The southwestern suburbs of Beiping are the main industrial and mining area of ​​Beiping city, with the Mentougou coal mine, the Shijingshan power plant and steel plant, and the Liulihe cement plant. At present, the daily coal production of public and private coal mines in Mentougou has reached more than 3,380 tons, and it will soon catch up with the level of 4,000 tons per day during the Kuomintang rule. The Shijingshan Power Plant has been able to supply most of the electricity needs of the industry and mining in the suburbs of Beiping, and sends 5,000 to 7,000 kilowatts of electricity to the city of Beiping every day. The Liulihe Cement Plant partially started operations on the 4th of this month, and now produces 5 to 8 tons of cement per day. In terms of railways, the Fengtai Station to Zhuoxian on the Pinghan Road and to Yangcun on the Beining Road have been opened to traffic. According to the estimates of the Kuomintang Geological Survey, the underground coal reserves in the Mentougou coal mining area reach 65 million tons. During the Japanese occupation, the daily coal production of public and private coal mines in the area totaled more than 15,000 tons, and 4,000 tons during the Kuomintang rule. The area currently has a coal reserve of 100,000 tons, which can supply more than 2 million citizens in Beiping for more than two months. Before liberation, the Shijingshan Power Plant could send more than 20,000 kilowatts of electricity during the day and 45,000 kilowatts at night, supplying industrial and civil electricity inside and outside Beiping city. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is the largest in North China, with a smelting capacity of 850 tons. During the Japanese occupation, the Liulihe Cement Plant produced 500 tons of cement per day, and 200 tons during the Kuomintang rule. Fengtai Station is the intersection of the Pinghan, Beining, and Pingsui three major railways, with 143 tracks in the station, intersecting intricately. The station was originally an important supply base for the Kuomintang army in North China, and its warehouse area covers an area of ​​40 square miles.
    Xinhua News Agency, North China, 20th. After the liberation of Hangu and Zhaishang Township in the Changlu Salt Flats of Hebei, which are famous throughout the country for producing sea salt, the salt-making industry in the two places has now mostly resumed work; the democratic government is vigorously helping the remaining factories that have not yet resumed work to resume work. Hangu is one of the four "Gus" (Tanggu, Dagu, Hangu, and Denggu) of Changlu, with a salt field area of ​​170,000 mu and 320 salt flats (each with an annual output of 2.5 million jin of salt). Zhaishang Township is located five miles east of Hangu Station on the Beining Railway, and relies on the east bank of the Jiyun River. Its east and west areas are surrounded by the Hangu Salt Flats, with a population of 30,000, and the salt-making chemical industry is developed. Before the liberation of the two places, the Jiang-Fu bandit army attempted to destroy various salt-making equipment, but under the heroic protection of all employees, all machines were intact.
    Note: Changlu Salt Flats are one of the four major salt regions in the country, with a history of more than 200 years. The four "Gus" in the area are located east of the Bohai Sea and west of the railway, spanning more than 300 li both vertically and horizontally, with an area of ​​343,000 mu, equivalent to 664 salt flats. The area is the center of salt-making chemical industry in North China, with modern salt-making equipment and various salt industry chemical plants, among which Jiuda Refined Salt Company and the bureaucratic capital's China Salt Industry Company are the most prominent. In addition to salt and refined salt, each "Gu" also produces by-products such as alkali, bleaching powder, Glauber's salt, gypsum, chlorine, bromine, anhydrous mirabilite, and magnesium compounds, which are important industrial products. Now, the four "Gus" of Changlu Salt Flats have all been liberated by us, which is of great significance to the industrial construction of North China.

　　平郊工矿业恢复生产
  　门头沟日产煤三千吨
    长芦盐滩的汉沽及寨上镇盐厂复工
    【新华社平郊廿日电】北平西南郊解放后，该地工矿业已先后开始恢复生产，铁路已部分通车。北平西南郊为北平市区主要工矿业所在地，该地有门头沟之煤矿，石景山之发电厂与钢铁厂，琉璃河之洋灰厂。刻门头沟公私煤矿每日产煤已达三千三百八十余吨，不久即可赶上国民党统治时期日产四千吨的水平。石景山发电厂已能供给平郊工矿业大部电力需要，并每日向北平城内送电五千至七千千瓦。琉璃河洋灰厂于本月四日部分开工，现日产洋灰五吨至八吨。铁路方面，丰台车站至平汉路的涿县及至北宁路的杨村已经通车。按门头沟煤矿区地下藏煤量，据国民党地质调查所估计，达六千五百万吨。日寇占领时期，该地公私煤矿每日产煤共一万五千余吨，国民党统治时期日产四千吨。该地现有存煤共十万吨，可供北平二百余万市民两月余之用。石景山发电厂在解放前日间可送电二万余千瓦，夜间可送四万五千千瓦，供给北平市区内外工业及民用电。石景山钢铁厂规模为华北第一，其熔铁量达八百五十吨。琉璃河洋灰厂在日寇占领时期日产洋灰五百吨，国民党统治时期日产二百吨。丰台车站为平汉、北宁、平绥三大铁路交叉点，站内路轨达一百四十三道，交叉错综。该站原为华北国民党军重要补给基地，其仓库区面积达四十平方里。
    【新华社华北二十日电】以产海盐著名全国的河北长芦盐滩之汉沽及寨上镇解放后，两地制盐工业现已大部复工；其余尚未复工各厂，民主政府正在大力帮助其复工中。汉沽为长芦四沽（塘沽、大沽、汉沽、邓沽）之一，盐田面积达十七万亩，有盐滩三百二十付（每付年产盐二百五十万斤）。寨上镇位于北宁铁路汉沽车站东五里，依蓟运河东岸，其东西一带即为汉沽盐滩所环绕，人口三万，制盐化学工业发达。该两地在临解放前，蒋傅匪军曾妄图破坏各种制盐设备，但在全体职工英勇保护下，全部机器均完好无损。
    按：长芦盐滩为全国四大盐区之一，具有二百余年的历史。该区四沽所在地，东临渤海，西至铁路，纵横均三百余里，面积达三十四万三千余亩，合盐滩六百六十四付。该区为华北制盐化学工业重心，具有现代化的制盐设备，并有各种盐业化学工厂，其中以久大精盐公司及官僚资本的中国盐业公司最具规模。各沽除产盐和精盐外，尚有副产品碱、漂白粉、元明粉、石膏、氯气、溴气、无水芒硝及镁的化合物等重要工业用品出产。现长芦盐滩之四沽已全部为我解放，对华北工业建设颇具重要意义。
