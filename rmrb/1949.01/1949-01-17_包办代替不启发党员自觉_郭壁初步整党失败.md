　　Pao-ban (Doing Everything) Instead of Inspiring Party Members' Consciousness
  　Guo Bi's Preliminary Party Rectification Fails
    [Da Yue Electric] The preliminary party rectification in Guo Bi Village, Sixth District of Qinshui, failed because it did not inspire the consciousness of party members and the masses, forming a direct confrontation between working cadres and party members who had made mistakes. The Guo Bi branch was established in 1942. Of the current twenty party members, thirteen are new middle peasants, six are old middle peasants, and one is a businessman, all of whom were active in the rent reduction, interest reduction, and land reform movements. The branch's organizational life is very unsound. Some party members have not participated in organizational activities for three years since joining the party. The education of party members is very poor, and their awareness is very low. Cadres have conflicts and hold prejudices. Party members have many behaviors that infringe upon the interests of the people and are seriously divorced from the masses. At the end of October, the county sent five cadres to lead the party rectification, four of whom were new cadres and one was a armed forces committee cadre. They lacked experience in party rectification and did not study the district party committee's instructions on party rectification work well. Upon arriving in the village, they were blocked by the branch. On the one hand, they wanted to put pressure on cadres with major mistakes, but on the other hand, they believed that ordinary party members and cadres were in the same boat. Therefore, they did not say anything to the party members, fearing that they would tip off the cadres, and of course, there was no conscious effort to cultivate activists. In this way, the working group isolated itself from the beginning. The branch meeting on November 2 conveyed the party rectification policy, but it was not arranged based on the situation in the village, but simply recited from the book, so the party members could not accept it. Therefore, they were not active in studying the policy and discussing how to rectify the party, but instead raised a pile of difficulties. Some resisted under various pretexts. For example, party member Wang Hezhong said, "I need to build a kiln"; Wang Haien said, "I have a canker sore." Some said they wanted to go out to make money. The working group ignored these excuses and rushed into individual self-examinations. Because they did not mobilize the consciousness of party members and the masses, and did not consciously cultivate activists, criticism and self-criticism could not be developed in individual self-examinations. Some party members with major mistakes took a resistant attitude. Instead of inspiring everyone to carry out appropriate struggles, the working group did not educate ordinary party members, but simply told the cadres to "review again"; or when the cadres did not reflect properly, they brought out the materials they had learned and directly accused them. This created a direct confrontation between the working group and the village cadres. For example, the former branch secretary scolded the head of the working group for accusing him of resisting self-examination and protecting landlords and rich peasants. Most party members either remained silent or acted as nice guys, helping the cadres. Their emotions were not high during the reflection. The better ones only reflected on themselves and did not offer opinions on others. An older party member said, "The soil is about to cover me, better to do less; the working group doesn't live in our village permanently." After the method of directly exerting pressure failed, the working group became laissez-faire. When there was no progress in meetings, they announced the adjournment and said they would come again tomorrow. The next day it was the same. For example, Wang Yaochun did not reflect properly and even scolded people. The next day at the meeting, he said "I was wrong," and everyone remained silent, and it passed. After it passed, the party members did not correct their mistakes. While rectifying the party, the branch secretary continued to beat people casually. When the working group found out, they did not resolve it well. The party rectification items passed one by one, and the last was the re-election of the branch. The working group did not dare to let everyone re-elect the branch committee, and decided to supplement three new branch committee members, but they did not dare to let everyone discuss it, so the working group designated three branch committee members and four group leaders. It was announced at the branch meeting. Two of the three new branch committee members were still probationary party members, which aroused dissatisfaction among party members and the masses.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    Editor's note: The failure of Guo Bi's preliminary party rectification shows that party rectification cannot be done entirely through Pao-ban, but must earnestly explain the purpose of party rectification to party members, inspire their consciousness of party rectification, and unite all activists and better elements in the branch to conduct serious criticism and ideological struggle against party members with serious mistakes who are unwilling to reflect, in order to promote their conscious self-examination and reform. Guo Bi violated this basic method and adopted the Pao-ban approach of the working group, resulting in complete failure, which was inevitable. This should be noted by comrades in charge of party rectification in various localities.

### 包办代替不启发党员自觉　郭壁初步整党失败

　　包办代替不启发党员自觉
  　郭壁初步整党失败
    【大岳电】沁水六区郭壁村支部初步整党，由于没有启发党员群众的自觉性，形成工作干部与犯错党员的直接对立，致使工作失败。郭壁支部是民国三十一年建立的。现在的二十个党员，有十三个是新中农，六个是老中农，一个是商人，都是减租减息、土地改革运动中的积极分子。支部组织生活很不健全，有的党员入党三年，没有过过组织生活。对党员的教育很差，党员觉悟很低，干部间闹不团结，抱成见。党员有很多侵犯人民利益的行为，严重脱离群众。十月底，县里派来五个领导整党的干部，有四个是新干部，一个是武委会干部。本身缺乏整党经验，对区党委关于整党工作的指示又没有很好学习过。一到村就被支部封锁了消息。他们一方面想对错误大的干部施以压力，但又认为一般党员和干部是一气。所以什么也不向党员们说，怕给干部送信，当然更谈不上有意识地培养积极分子了。这样，工作组一开始就将自己孤立起来了。十一月二号的支部大会传达了整党方针，但没根据本村的情况布置，只是照本子说了一遍，因此党员接受不了。所以都不积极研究方针，讨论如何整党，而是提出一堆困难。有些则借故抵抗。如党员王和忠说：“我要打窑”；王还恩说：“我生着对口疮”。有些人则说要出去赚钱。工作组也不理睬这些，毛毛草草地就进入了个人检查。由于没有发动党员群众的自觉，没去有意识地培养积极分子，在个人检查中，批评与自我批评展不开；有些错误大的党员是抵抗态度。工作组对此，不是启发大家进行适当的斗争，对一般党员也不进行教育，只是叫干部“再检讨检讨”；或是干部不好好反省时，就把自己了解到的材料搬出来，直接指责一番。这样就造成工作组与村干部直接对立。如前支书因工作组指责他抵抗反省，包庇地富，便把工作组组长大骂一顿。大多数党员有的不吭气，有的也当好人，给干部帮帮腔。反省时情绪都不高。好一些的也只反省一下自己，不提别人的意见。一个年纪较老的党员说：“土快盖住啦，多一事不如少一事；工作组又不常住在咱村。”直接施行压力的作法失败后，工作组便又放任开了。会议上争吵不下时，就宣布散会，明天再来。明天来了又是如此。如王耀春不好好反省，还骂人，第二天在会上说了一声“我错了”，大家不吭声，就过去了，过去后，党员并不改正错误。一面整党，支书还在一面随便打人。工作组知道了，也没很好的解决。整党项目一项项挨着过去了，最后是改选支部。工作组不敢让大家改选支委，决定补充三个新支委，也不敢让大家讨论，就由工作组指定了三个支委和四个小组长。在支部大会上宣布了一下。三个新支委中，有两个还是候补党员，引起了党员群众的不满。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：郭壁初步整党的失败，说明整党是完全不能包办的，必须认真向党员讲明整党的目的，启发其整党的自觉性，并团结支部中一切积极分子与较好分子，向错误严重而又不肯反省的党员进行严肃的批评与思想斗争，才能促进其自觉反省与改过。郭壁违反了这一基本方法，采取了工作组包办的做法，结果完全失败，这是必然的。应该引起各地领导整党同志的注意。
