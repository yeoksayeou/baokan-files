Shijiazhuang News: The Shijiazhuang City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee and the Railway Workers' General Union, in order to welcome the victorious completion of the Increase Production and Make Up for Losses competition movement and to invigorate the lives of workers throughout the city, are organizing Spring Festival entertainment activities and holding a Spring Festival Workers' Sports Meet. A meeting of union cadres from more than 30 units, including the Guangming Factory, Fanrong Factory, Yumin Industrial Company, Electric Light Company, Telephone Bureau, Electrical Workers' Union, Cotton Textile Workers' Union, Fuyuan Chemical Factory, and various factories of the railway system, was recently held. Comrade Zhang Wenfang of the City Federation of Trade Unions reported on the various resolutions of the Spring Festival Cultural and Entertainment Committee, calling on workers throughout the city to take a leading role in the Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities. It was stipulated that January 12th to 19th would be Creation Week, during which workers from various factories and literary and art workers assigned to various factories would create and write a large number of plays in various forms based on vivid and specific facts such as changes in workers' thinking, democratic life, and production competitions to be supplied for performance. All programs written by various factories must first be sent to the City Federation of Trade Unions to correct the facts, consider whether the commendations and criticisms are appropriate, and assess the educational effect on the masses. Better works will be awarded as appropriate. At the same time, it is required that various factories strictly correct and oppose the performance of works with low-level, vulgar, feudal superstitious, and reactionary toxins during the Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities. Regarding the holding of the Spring Festival Workers' Sports Meet, the meeting determined that the spirit and content of the sports meet should promote collective activities, strengthen the body, and focus on projects that are rich in political and educational significance and are simple and easy to implement, such as tug-of-war, writing races, fraternal races, annihilation battles, Yangko performances, and basketball. Factories will participate freely by selecting projects as units. The date for holding the sports meet will be the second and third days of the Spring Festival (i.e., the second and third days of the first lunar month). Representatives from the City Federation of Trade Unions, the Railway Workers' General Union, and others will be elected on the spot to form a preparatory committee for the city's Spring Festival Workers' Sports Meet, which will be responsible for drafting various regulations for the event, presiding over the various projects of the event, and awarding prizes.
