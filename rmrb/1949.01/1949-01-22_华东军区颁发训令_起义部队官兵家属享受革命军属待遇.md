Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The East China Military Region has recently issued the following order regarding "the treatment of uprising unit families in the liberated areas as military dependents":

　　Based on the telegram order from the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: All units that have risen up and joined the People's Liberation Army, from the date of their uprising, their officers' and soldiers' families shall be considered revolutionary military families. They should enjoy the treatment of revolutionary military families within the liberated areas. Those whose lives are indeed difficult should be given care by the democratic government in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations.

　　Therefore, in addition to requesting the Shandong Provincial Government and local democratic governments to file and handle the matter, special instructions and regulations are given to all commanders and combatants of the uprising units regarding the issues they should pay attention to concerning family matters:

　　1. The political departments of the uprising units at the column (army) level should notify the local governments directly under their jurisdiction of the origins, names and addresses of family members (direct military dependents or indirect relatives), and family economic conditions of all officers and soldiers of the uprising in the liberated areas, so that they can be handled according to the actual situation of their families and in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations.

　　2. The People's Liberation Army serves the people. Regardless of the old Liberation Army or the newly uprising units, they should resolutely support the land reform and rent reduction and interest rate reduction policies of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government. Absolutely no opposition to or sabotage of land reform and rent reduction and interest rate reduction is allowed. Even if there are some deviations in the implementation of land reform in individual areas, the troops can only make suggestions to the local government and the Party committee based on the actual situation and information they know, and the local Party and government organs will investigate and correct them. At present, it is temporarily stipulated that such formal suggestions should be signed and sealed by the military and political leaders above the division level in the uprising units before being sent out. Organs and individuals below the division level only have the right to reflect materials and put forward opinions to the higher leading organs of the troops, and shall not, under the guise of suggestions, casually put forward inappropriate opinions to the local Party and government or directly interfere.

　　3. The newly uprising units should repeatedly and universally educate their members on the order issued by this military region on December 15, 1947, so that all commanders and fighters consciously support and endorse the just actions of land reform. If individual elements in the troops directly interfere with, oppose, or sabotage land reform, the local government and the troop leadership organs may stop their actions and, if necessary, arrest them and hand them over to the appropriate military region for handling according to law.

Commander Chen Yi, Deputy Commander Zhang Yunyi, Political Commissar Rao Shushi, Director Shu Tong

　　华东军区颁发训令
  　起义部队官兵家属享受革命军属待遇
    【新华社华东十九日电】华东军区顷颁发“关于起义部队在解放区军属的待遇问题”的训令如下：
    奉中国人民解放军总部电令：凡起义加入人民解放军的部队，自起义之日起，其官兵之家属即为革命军人家属，在解放区内应享受革命军人家属之待遇，其生活确有困难者，得由民主政府按优属条例给以照顾。
    为此，除请准山东省政府与各地民主政府备案处理外，特对起义部队全体指挥员战斗员，在对家属问题上应注意的问题，作如下的指示和规定：
    一、各起义部队的纵队（军）政治部，应将起义全体官兵在解放区的籍贯、家属姓名地址与本人关系（直系军属或间接亲属）、家庭经济状况等，通知各该直接管辖地方政府，以便依据其家属实际情况及按照优属条例办理。
    二、人民解放军是为人民服务的，不论老解放军与新起义部队，应坚决拥护共产党与人民民主政府之土地改革与减租减息政策，绝不准许有反对及破坏土地改革和减租减息的行为；即令个别地区在执行土地改革中存有某些偏差，部队只能将所知实际情况及意见，向地方政府及党委提出建议，由地方党政机关查明纠正之。此种正式建议在起义部队目前暂规定由师以上的军政首长签名盖章送发之，师以下机关及个人只有向部队上级领导机关反映材料及提出意见之权，不得借建议之名，随便直接向地方党政提出不妥当意见或直接干涉。
    三、新起义部队，应将本军区在一九四七年十二月十五日所颁布的命令，反复普遍进行教育，使全体指战员自觉的赞助与支持土地改革的正义行动。部队中如有个别分子直接干涉或反对与破坏土地改革的行为，地方政府及部队领导机关得制止其行动，必要时得加以逮捕送交适当军区依法处理之。
