Let Everyone Get Involved
　Write Letters of慰勞to the Soldiers
    To workers in factories, teachers and students in primary and secondary schools, and cadres in rural areas and government offices:

    The soldiers at the front have recently brought us a series of great victories. In addition to cheering and applauding, we must also pay them the highest and warmest respect. Therefore, we suggest that everyone get involved in writing letters of慰勞 to pay tribute to the soldiers who are bravely killing the enemy at the front. Put our every beating heart on paper, so that our soldiers can be encouraged and fight more bravely.

　　请大家齐动手
  　给将士们写慰劳信
    各工厂工人们，各中小学师生们，各农村、机关干部：
    前方将士们最近又给我们带来了一连串的大胜利。我们除了欢呼鼓掌外，一定还要向他们致以最崇高的最热烈的敬意，因此我们建议大家一齐动手来写慰劳信，向正在前方英勇杀敌的将士们致敬。把我们每颗跃动的心搬到纸上来，让我们的将士们得到这些鼓励后，战斗得更勇敢。
