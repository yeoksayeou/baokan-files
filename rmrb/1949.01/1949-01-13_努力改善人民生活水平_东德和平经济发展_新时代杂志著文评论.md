Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS reports: The latest issue of New Era magazine published an article by Kuusinen comprehensively discussing the development of East Germany's peaceful economy, stating that the development of Germany's peaceful economy is one of the conditions for making Germany a peaceful and democratic country, and it also helps the economic recovery of other European countries.

The author points out that Germany's peaceful economy is developing on the basis of land reform, the elimination of Nazis and war criminals, and the nationalization of some industrial enterprises. The working class and its organizations have played a decisive role in economic reconstruction. In public enterprises, more than 40% of the managers are active members of trade unions, and the rest are appointed on the suggestion and support of the trade union.

Kuusinen pointed out that the Soviet occupation authorities, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, have steadfastly striven to improve the living standards of the working masses and safeguard their social rights. The entire trend of economic development in the Soviet occupation zone shows that the economy there is a peaceful economy and is managed according to a democratic line.

After outlining the two-year economic plan initiated by the Socialist Unity Party and supported by the broad masses of the people, the author points out that this plan opens up broad prospects for economic progress for the people of East Germany, guaranteeing the growth of peaceful industry. The two-year plan stipulates a continuous increase in real wages, which stands in stark contrast to the situation in the Western German joint occupation zones, where wages are decreasing month by month and prices are constantly rising.

After pointing out that the characteristic of the two-year plan lies in assigning decisive tasks to public enterprises, Kuusinen states that public enterprises already account for 99% of coal and electricity production, 54% of metal production, and 40% of machine production. In the third quarter of 1948, public enterprises already accounted for 55% of the total production.

The author concludes by pointing out that in the past three and a half years, the people of East Germany have achieved great success in the democratic regeneration of political and economic life. The Soviet military government actively encourages the growth of democratic forces among the German people. The development of East Germany's peaceful economy points the German people to the path of democracy, peace, and progress.

    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社讯：最近一期新时代杂志发表库辛斯基综论东德和平经济之发展的专文称：德国和平经济的发展，是使德国成为和平民主国家的条件之一；而且有助于欧洲其他国家经济的恢复。
    作者指出：德国和平经济是在土地改革、清除纳粹、战犯及若干工业企业的国有化基础上发展起来的。工人阶级及其组织在经济重建中担任了决定性的任务。在公营企业中，有百分之四十以上的经理由工会的积极分子担任，其余的也是在职工会建议与支持下任命的。
    库辛斯基指出：苏占区当局依照菠茨顿协定，坚定不移地努力改善劳动群众的生活水平，并维护他们的社会权利。苏占区经济发展的整个趋势显示：该处的经济是和平的经济，是依照民主路线管理的。
    作者于概述去复由统一社会党所倡议而为广大人民所拥护的两年经济计划后，指出：这一计划在东德人民面前展开了经济进展的远大前途，保证和平工业的增长。两年计划规定实际工资不断增加，这与西德联合占领区的工资逐月减少，物价则不断上涨的情形适成对照。
    库辛斯基于指出两年计划的特点在于将决定性的任务交由公营企业承担后称：公营企业已在煤和电力生产方面占有百分之九十九，在金属产量方面占百分之五十四，在机器生产方面占百分之四十。而在一九四八年第三季的全部生产中，公营企业已占了百分之五十五。
    作者最后指出：三年半来，东德人民在政治、经济生活的民主再生方面，获有巨大成就。苏联军政府积极鼓励德国人民民主力量的生长。东德和平经济的发展，向德国人民指出了到达民主、和平与进步的道路。
