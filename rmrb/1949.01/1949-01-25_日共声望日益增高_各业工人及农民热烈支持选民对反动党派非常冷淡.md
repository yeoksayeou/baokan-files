　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS Tokyo dispatch: According to newspaper reports: A characteristic of the recent Japanese election campaign is that voters are becoming increasingly passive. The bourgeois press attributes this situation to the decline in the living standards of the working people, the people's growing lack of confidence in the government due to the corruption and malfeasance of government leaders, and the strict restrictions imposed on the election activities of various political parties and candidates. However, the bourgeois press did not mention the main reason for the voters' apathy. According to progressive opinion, the voters' apathy lies in the fact that the current government is nothing more than a puppet of the occupying authorities. The strict restrictions imposed on the election of candidates and the apathy of the people are proceeding simultaneously with the behind-the-scenes conspiracies of politicians, who are massively buying votes. The Japan Times was forced to admit that the current election law only guarantees the victory of candidates with power and money. The people are extremely indignant at the fact that many figures involved in the recent fraud cases, such as Ashida, Nishio, Hoshino, etc., are running for election again. The Tokyo Shimbun expressed great concern about this matter, fearing that "the new parliament will become a grand gathering of hooligans, rascals, profiteers, and party hacks." According to newspaper reports, the prestige of the Japanese Communist Party is increasing day by day. A survey conducted in Kobe proved that 38 percent of local metalworkers support the Communist Party, while only 19 percent support the Socialist Party. A similar survey conducted in Osaka proved that 54 percent of transportation workers support the Communist Party, while only 27 percent support the Socialist Party. The Yomiuri Shimbun claimed that 40 percent of transportation workers in southern Hokkaido and 80 percent of organized farmers in Aomori Prefecture support the Communist Party.
　　
　　In other news, Reuters Tokyo: The Japan Seamen's Union announced on the 20th that unless the government amends the election law to allow the 300,000 sailors at sea to vote, they will file a lawsuit demanding that the general election be declared invalid. This is because, under the new election law, sailors cannot vote on their ships, but must vote at the nearest port. The Seamen's Union headquarters stated that this procedure would prevent sailors from casting their votes on January 23rd.

　　日共声望日益增高
  　各业工人及农民热烈支持选民对反动党派非常冷淡
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社东京讯：据报纸消息：最近日本选举运动的特点，就是选民们愈来愈消极了。资产阶级报纸将这种情形归因于劳动人民生活水准的下降，人民因为政府领袖们的贪污舞弊而对政府日益缺乏信心，以及对各政党与候选人的竞选活动所施的严格限制。然而，资产阶级报纸未提到选民不热心的主要原因。根据进步人士的意见，选民的不热心乃在于目前政府不过是占领当局的傀儡这个事实上。对候选人竞选所施的严格限制以及人民的不热心，与政客的幕后阴谋同时进行着，这些政客正大规模地收买选民。日本时报被迫承认：现行的选举法只保证那些有势有钱候选人的胜利。人民对于下述事实极为愤慨，即许多牵连在最近舞弊案中的人物，如芦田、西尾、星野等人，又都重新竞选。东京新闻对于此事甚表忧虑，深恐“新议会又成为流氓、恶棍、投机牟利之徒与党棍”的大集合。据报纸消息：日共的声望日益增高。神户所进行的调查证明：在当地五金工人中，有百分之三十八支持共产党，只有百分之十九支持社会党。在大坂进行的同样调查证明，交通工人中有百分之五十四支持共产党，只有百分之二十七支持社会党。读卖新闻称：北海道南部交通工人的百分之四十以及青森县有组织的农民的百分之八十，都拥护共产党。
    另据路透社东京讯：日本海员工会于二十日宣布：除非政府修改选举法，以便使海上的三十万海员能够投票，否则他们将提出诉讼，要求宣告大选无效。因为根据新选举法，海员不能在他们的船上进行投票，而必须在最近的港埠进行投票。海员工会总部称：这种程序将使海员不能在一月二十三日投出他们的选票。
