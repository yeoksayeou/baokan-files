　　Ugly as Ghosts!
　　The People's View of the Bandit Fu Troops
　　On the night of December 11th, when we advanced to Liangjia Village, five miles north of Xinbaoan City, as soon as we entered the house, an old landlady surnamed Tian, in her fifties, told us about the Fu bandit's 35th Army's embarrassed escape before being annihilated, as if she had met her own family. She said, "Comrades! We've been waiting for you! You didn't see it, on the 7th, before noon, those damned dogs surrounded in Xinbaoan were rolling down the north side of the road. Their faces were grey, they hadn't washed their faces for days, and they were uglier than ghosts! In that ghost army, some of the 'wives' riding livestock were even uglier, with disheveled hair like ghosts, their permed curly hair covered in mud, their faces yellow, some holding babies, crying and screaming while riding mules. Our small cannons in the back kept firing, 'dang, dang,' chasing after them. The north mountain was filled with black smoke, getting closer and closer. Cars were passing by on the road in the village, carrying foreign tables, foreign chairs, pork, rice, chicken, and small packages, so much stuff! Only their high-ranking officials had these things. Some of the soldiers were like hungry wolves, rushing into homes, overturning pots and stoves, and when they saw the seven or eight sorghum cakes in my house, they didn't care about anything else, shouting, 'Ah! I'm starving! I'm starving!' while stuffing them into their pockets and running away. Later, some people came and grabbed the clay pot, scrambling to drink up the porridge. Some forced me to 'quickly boil water, quickly boil water.' Before I could even boil the water, they had already run away. I asked them, 'Why are you in such a hurry?' They said, 'To chase after the Eighth Route Army.' I asked them, 'Why are they firing cannons in the back?' They said, 'That's us attacking forward.' That's how it went for less than half a day, and our troops chased after them, surrounding those damned dogs in Xinbaoan City." The old lady finished speaking in one breath, paused slightly, her eyes red with tears, and said, "Comrades! It's been dark for two years! Today the sky is clear, go fight them quickly, don't let a single one of them escape!"

　　难看的象个鬼呢？
  　人民眼中的傅匪军
    十二月十一日夜，当我们挺进到新保安城北五里梁家庄时，刚进到房子里，一个姓田的五十多岁的房东老大娘，象见了亲人似的，向我们诉说傅匪三十五军被歼灭前狼狈逃窜的情形。她说：“同志啊！可把你们盼到了，你没见哪，初七那天，天还不晌午，被咱围在新保安的这些狗日的们，就呼呼的顺着北边汽车道滚着一圪＠跑下来了，一个个脸上灰查查的，不知多少天不洗脸了，难看的真不如个鬼呢！那鬼队伍里边，有些骑牲口的“太太”，更难看，象鬼似的披头散发，那烫的曲哩拐弯的头发上尽是泥，一个个脸色黄黄的，还有的怀里揣着娃娃，乱哭乱叫的骑着骡子跑。咱们后边的小炮，老是当、当的追着他们响。打的那北山上一股黑烟、一股黑烟的，愈打愈紧。村里的汽路上过着汽车，车上拉着洋棹子、洋椅子、还有猪肉、大米、鸡子、小包袱，东西真多呀！这些东西都是他们当大官的才有呢。有好些当兵的象饿狼似的，跑进家来就翻锅倒灶，见了俺们家的那七、八个高粱饼子，连啥都不顾，一边嚷着：啊！饿坏了！饿坏了！一边就装进口袋里跑了。后边来了几个人端起沙锅来就抢着把稀饭喝光了。有的逼我“快烧开水，快烧开水”。还没等我把水烧的冒了热气，他们早跑了。我问他们：“你们为什么这么急呢？”他们说：“追击八路去。”我问他们：“为什么后边放炮呢？”他们说：“那是我们往前打呢。”就这样过了没有半天，咱们的队伍就从后追来啦，把狗日们全围在新保安城里。”老大娘一口气说完了以上的话，略停了停，两眼圈红红的含着泪珠说：“同志呀！黑了两年啦！今儿天可晴了，你们快打吧，可别让他们跑出一个来。”
