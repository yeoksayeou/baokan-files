　　Union Can Provide Partial Subsidies to Workers with Special Difficulties

To the Editors:
　　Before the implementation of enterprise management, my wages were sufficient to support my wife and children. After the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, and according to the new instructions, all factories implemented enterprise management, and my factory was no exception. (This corrected the previous excessively high wage system and egalitarianism in the wage system.) This is very good, but precisely because of this, my family life has become impossible to manage. I asked the leadership to find a way for me, and they told me to return home and settle down, and even helped me with 30,000 yuan as a settlement fee, but this did not solve my difficulties, because my family background is not good, and there isn't even a pot or bowl in the house. Thus, the leadership introduced me to the county government. After being introduced by the county government to the village government, the village gave me two dou of grain, but my life is still unresolved. This makes me very distressed. What should I do now? Please, editors, find a way for me, and I hope to get specific help based on the Party's policies.

To the Editors:
　　I am a typist, thirty-nine years old this year, and have a family of four or five. My eldest child is only twelve years old. Before June of this year, my monthly salary was equivalent to 160 jin of millet, plus 100 jin of family allowance millet, totaling 260 jin of millet. For a family of five, after deducting food expenses, we could still manage to solve the problem of clothing. Since enterprise management was implemented in June, my salary has been determined based on my skills, at forty @ per month, equivalent to 200 jin of millet. Therefore, the whole family is somewhat short of food, let alone clothing and other expenses. Here, please find a solution for me, or give me a direction.

    Answer: According to the resolution on wage issues of the Sixth National Labor Congress: the minimum wage for ordinary workers should support two people, including themselves, and the life of the supported person should generally be lower than their own. If their family has too many people, in addition to individual cases with special difficulties where the union can provide partial subsidies from labor insurance or employee benefits, all those with labor or semi-labor capabilities should try to participate in labor as much as possible; those with land in the countryside should engage in agricultural production (they can learn slowly if they don't know how); those without land can be allocated some land by the village; if there is no land in the countryside, they can engage in handicraft production (such as weaving, making shoes, sewing clothes, etc.) to "make the best use of their talents," and everyone can actively participate in labor, which will not only solve their own living problems but also increase social wealth. Therefore, local leaders should find ways to help worker Comrade Zhang Guangliang settle his family and participate in production, and should not ignore him because of his poor family background. However, for problems like that of Comrade Liu Xibao (many children, and the eldest child is only twelve years old, consuming a lot and unable to produce), in addition to providing appropriate subsidies from employee benefits and labor insurance, there is no better solution. We hope that everyone (especially worker comrades) and the factory will provide more positive suggestions.

### 工人有特殊困难者工会可给部分补贴

专栏：询问与答复

　　工人有特殊困难者工会可给部分补贴编辑同志：
    在未实行企业化以前，我挣的工资足能养活老婆和孩子，经华北工商会议以后，根据新的指示，各厂都实行了企业化，我厂也没有例外。（纠正了过去过高的工资制度及工资制度中的平均主义思想）这是很好的，但正因此我的家庭生活却无法解决了。我就要求领导上给我想办法，他叫我回家安置，还帮助我三万元安家费，但这些并不能解决我的困难，因为我的家庭成份不好，家中连个锅碗都没有，这样，领导上便给我介绍到县政府。又经县政府介绍到村政府，村里给了我二斗谷子，但生活仍不能得到解决。这使我很苦恼、现在究应如何办呢？请编者同志替我想一个办法，并希望根据党的政策，具体地给我帮助。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（张广亮）编辑同志：
    我是一个打字工人，今年三十九岁，家里有四五口人，大孩子才十二岁。在今年六月以前，我每月的工资合小米一百六十斤，加上一百斤家属津贴米，共有二百六十斤小米，一家五口，除去伙食外，还可以解决穿衣问题。自六月改为企业化后，我的工资是根据技术评定的，每月四十个＠，共合小米二百斤。因此，全家的伙食就有些亏欠了，穿衣及其他的费用就更谈不到。在此，请你们替我想一个解决的办法，或者给我指示一条道路。　　　　　　　　　　　（刘锡保）
    答：根据第六次全国劳动代表大会关于工资问题的决议是：普通工人的最低工资，连本人在内应养活两个人，而被养人的生活，一般应低于其本人。如果其家庭人口过多，除个别有特殊困难者，工会可从劳动保险或职工福利中给以部分补贴外，凡有劳动力或半劳动力者，都应尽量参加劳动；乡间有地的应进行农业生产（不会可以慢慢学）；没有地的可由村里分给部分土地；如在乡间没有地的，则可进行手工业生产（如纺织、做鞋、缝衣服等），以使“人尽其才”，人人积极参加劳动，这样既解决了自己的生活问题又，增添了社会财富。因此，工人张广亮同志安置家庭参加生产，当地领导上应想办法帮助他解决困难，不应因成份不好而不管。但如刘锡保同志这样的问题（孩子多，大孩子又只有十二岁，消耗大而又不能生产），除从职工福利和劳动保险中给以适当补贴外，还没有更好的办法，希望大家（尤其是工人同志）和厂方多提供积极的意见。
