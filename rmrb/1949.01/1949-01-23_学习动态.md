　　Learning Dynamics
    △The Jingxing County Party Committee recently convened a learning mobilization and review meeting to review the learning of the past three months of October, November, and December last year, and to arrange the learning for January and February. The review of past learning led to the following conclusions: First, the leading cadres did not sufficiently motivate everyone; second, the learning was not connected to practical realities; third, the grouping was not well-considered, causing comrades with lower levels to have low learning enthusiasm; and fourth, some comrades were overambitious and not humble. In addition, some comrades emphasized being busy with work and did not adhere to the learning system. Based on the review of the past, the learning plan for January and February was decided as follows: (1) Organize a learning committee. (2) Divide the county's directly subordinate organs into three major groups. Each group is divided into B and C classes according to cultural and theoretical levels. The learning content for Class B is theoretical learning, mainly studying "The History of Social Development." Class C focuses on cultural learning. The learning method for Class B is mainly self-study, supplemented by collective research. Class C will focus on collective learning, supplemented by self-study. It is also stipulated that there will be a monthly test. Comrades who can write work reports must write a newsletter every month, and a learning leave system will be established.
    △The Propaganda Department of the Changzhi County Party Committee issued a winter learning plan for county and district on-the-job cadres on January 5th, pointing out that time must be arranged to seize the time for learning in a planned way, and emphasized that active self-study should be the main focus. The learning method is divided into three classes: the advanced class studies theory, such as "On Coalition Government," "The History of Social Development," and newspapers and instructions; the intermediate class studies basic knowledge such as "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Socialism," the Party Constitution and Program, and branch textbooks; and the low-level class basically learns culture, stipulating that those who are illiterate learn three characters a day, in addition to learning professional skills and policies in work.
    △The Propaganda Department of the Jinnan Fifth Prefectural Committee summarized the learning of various counties on January 8th, pointing out: "The results of this test were not good because we did not learn regularly in the past and did not pay enough attention to learning." Since this test, cadres in various counties have realized the danger of not learning. For example, cadres in Fudong generally reflected: "We know too little." This raised everyone's vigilance. The summary finally pointed out: In the future, all counties must create a conscious learning movement. Key members and activists must take the lead. Leading cadres should give lessons to cadres with low levels in a planned way; moreover, it is necessary to create a learning environment and correctly use testing.

　　学习动态
    △井陉县委于日前召开了一次学习动员检讨大会，检讨了去年十、十一、十二三个月的学习，并布置了一、二两月份的学习。对于过去学习的检讨得出下面几个结论：第一是负责干部带动大家不够，第二是学习时不能联系实际。第三是编组时没有照顾好，使水平低的同志学习情绪不高。第四是一些同志好高鹜远，不虚心。另外还有些同志强调工作忙，不坚持学习制度。根据对过去的检讨，决定了一、二两月的学习计划。（一）组织学习委员会。（二）将县直属机关编为三大组。各组根据文化、理论水平分为乙丙类，乙类学习内容是理论学习，主要学习“社会发展史”。丙类以学习文化为主。学习方法，乙类以自学为主，以集体研究为辅。丙类则以集体学习为主，辅以自学。并规定每月测验一次。能写工作报告的同志每月必写一篇通讯，建立学习请假制度。
    △长治县县委宣传部于一月五日发出县区在职干部冬季学习计划，指出必须有计划的安排时间抓紧学习，并强调应以主动的自学为主。学习方法分为三班，高级班学习理论，如“论联合政府”、“社会发展史”及报纸，指示，中级班则学习“农业社会主义问答”、党章党纲、支部教材等基本知识，低级班基本上是学文化，规定不识字的每日认三个字，另外要学习业务及工作中的政策。
    △冀南五地委宣传部于一月八日总结各县的学习，指出：“这次测验的结果不好，是由于我们在过去没有经常的学习，对学习不够重视。”自从这次测验后，各县干部同志都认识了不学习的危险，如阜东的干部普遍反映：“自己知道的太少了。”提起了大家的警惕。总结最后指出：各县今后一定要把学习造成一个自觉的学习运动，骨干分子，积极分子一定要起带头作用，首长要有计划的给程度低的干部上课；而且，要建造学习环境，正确的运用测验。
