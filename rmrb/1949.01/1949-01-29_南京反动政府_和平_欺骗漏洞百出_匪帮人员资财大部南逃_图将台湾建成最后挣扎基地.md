Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 27th: One of the loopholes in the Nanjing Kuomintang government's peace deception is the continued southward flight of personnel and assets from Kuomintang government organs. According to various sources: the Kuomintang government and the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held an "emergency discussion on accelerating the retreat" in mid-month, ordering the concentration of vehicles on the Nanjing-Shanghai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou lines, as well as China Merchants Bureau ships, to accelerate the evacuation of personnel, materials, and files to Taiwan, Guangzhou, and other locations in South China. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd, citing materials "confirmed by the Kuomintang government's 'Information Bureau'," stated: Ninety percent of the Kuomintang government's organs and an average of eighty percent of its personnel have already evacuated Nanjing. An Associated Press dispatch stated: Only the "seals" of each department still symbolize that the Kuomintang government is in Nanjing, but its daily work is rarely carried out. Although the Kuomintang government notified the embassies of various countries in Nanjing on the 19th to evacuate to Guangzhou, the main destination of the Kuomintang bandit gang's southward flight is actually Taiwan. Before the pseudo-"President" Chiang Kai-shek left Nanjing on the 21st under the pretext of "retirement," most of Chiang's household belongings, documents, and Chiang's three "Packard" cars had already been shipped to Taiwan. The families of war criminals He Yingqin, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, Wang Shijie, Zhang Daofan, Xu Yongchang, Tang Enbo, Hu Zongnan, Gu Zhutong, and Xuan Tiewu have fled to Taiwan. Several departments of the Kuomintang Navy and Air Force Headquarters and a large number of staff officers have been evacuated to Taiwan, and Kuomintang special agent organs have also established headquarters in Taiwan. Since the "currency reform," a large amount of gold and silver plundered from the people by Kuomintang banks is being rushed to Taiwan and other places. The equipment of the Hanyang Arsenal and four factories in Nanjing has already been shipped to Taiwan by special ships. The purpose of the Kuomintang bandit gang is to build Taiwan into a base for conducting a final anti-revolutionary war under the direct protection of the United States. Chiang Kai-shek's special appointment of Chen Cheng as Chairman of Taiwan Province and Chiang Ching-kuo as Director of the Taiwan Kuomintang Provincial Party Headquarters is for this purpose. Simultaneously with the Kuomintang bandit gang's flight to Taiwan, a part of the US advisory group and the US Air Force organization stationed in Chengdu have also withdrawn to Taiwan. Mr. Badawei, head of the US advisory group, flew to Taiwan in early this month to conduct a detailed inspection. Three ships of US aid to Chiang's military supplies, originally intended to be shipped to South China and worth US$26 million, were also rerouted to Taiwan in early this month according to the Kuomintang government's wishes. Due to the surge of Kuomintang government materials, Keelung, the largest port in Taiwan, is in unprecedented chaos. The port's daily unloading capacity is only 2,000 tons, and its railway transportation capacity is only over 3,000 tons, while by the 13th, the materials that could not be unloaded from the ships berthed in the port and the materials piled up in the port's warehouses had reached 120,000 tons. Some ships that arrived at the port had no choice but to transport most of the original cargo back to Shanghai because they could not unload. Prices in Taiwan are also rising rapidly due to the large influx of Kuomintang government personnel, which has aggravated the chaotic economic situation in Taiwan. A small Japanese-style house originally worth US$300 is now priced at US$10,000, and the black market exchange rate for US dollars on the 16th has doubled compared to the beginning of the month. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 11th, about 50,000 people arrive in Taiwan from the mainland every week, most of whom are Kuomintang government officials and their families.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 27th: Demonstrations against the Kuomintang bandit gang have erupted continuously by civil servants in Nanjing. The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, busy fleeing south, has drastically reduced the number of middle and lower-level civil servants, thus arousing their angry protests. According to foreign news agency reports: On the 19th, more than 600 dismissed civil servants demonstrated in front of the pseudo-Executive Yuan, demanding that the Kuomintang government provide them with sufficient travel expenses to return to their hometowns and six months' salary. On the same day, hundreds of civil servants also demonstrated in front of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan. On the 20th, a demonstration of 2,000 civil servants broke out in front of the pseudo-finance department. Contrary to the Kuomintang bandit gang's panicky escape, according to an Associated Press dispatch, ordinary middle and lower-level civil servants "are staying in Nanjing no matter what," and unwillingness to flee south with the Kuomintang bandit gang has become a "general sentiment" among middle and lower-level civil servants.

　　南京反动政府“和平”欺骗漏洞百出
  　匪帮人员资财大部南逃
    图将台湾建成最后挣扎基地
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】南京国民党政府和平欺骗的漏洞之一，就是国民党政府机关的人员资财继续南逃。据各方消息披露：国民党政府及国民党中央党部曾于本月中旬举行关于所谓“加紧撤退的紧急讨论”，命令集中京沪、浙赣、粤汉各路车辆及招商局轮船，加紧撤运人员、物资和文件档案至台湾、广州及华南其他地点。合众社南京二十二日电引国民党政府“新闻局证实”的材料称：国民党政府百分之九十的机关及平均百分之八十的人员已经撤离南京。美联社消息则说：只有各部门的“印信”仍象征着国民党政府是在南京，但其日常工作已很少进行。虽然国民党政府曾于十九日通知驻南京各国大使馆要他们撤往广州，但实际上国民党匪帮现在南逃的主要目的地是台湾。伪“总统”蒋介石在二十一日以“引退”名义离开南京以前，蒋的大部分家庭杂物、文件及蒋的三辆“白卡尔”汽车早已运抵台湾。战争罪犯何应钦、桂永清、周至柔、陈立夫、陈果夫、王世杰、张道藩、徐永昌、汤恩伯、胡宗南、顾祝同、宣铁吾等人的眷属已逃抵台湾。国民党海空军总司令部的若干部门和大批参谋人员都已撤到台湾，国民党特务机关也已在台建立总部。国民党各银行自“改革币制”以来掠夺自民间的大量金银正赶速运往台湾等地，汉阳兵工厂和南京四个工厂的装备，业已由专轮运往台湾。国民党匪帮的目的是打算在美国直接庇护下，将台湾建成为进行最后挣扎的反革命战争基地。蒋介石的特别任命陈诚为台湾省主席和蒋经国为台湾国民党省党部主任委员，其用意即在此。和国民党匪帮的逃台同时，美国顾问团的一部分和美空军组织驻成都的航空队也已撤至台湾。美顾问团团长巴大维曾于本月上旬飞往台湾进行详细视察，原来打算运往华南的价值二千六百万美元的三船美国援蒋军事物资，亦按照国民党政府意见于本月上旬改运至台湾。由于国民党政府物资的潮涌而至，台湾最大港口基隆港已呈空前混乱现象。该港每日卸运能力仅为二千吨，其铁路转运能力仅为三千多吨，而至十三日，停泊该港的轮船无法卸运的物资和该港码头仓库堆存的物资却已达十二万吨，有些到港船只因无法卸货只好又将原载物资的大部分运回上海。台湾的物价亦因国民党政府人员的大量涌至而飞速上涨，加重了台湾经济的混乱情势。原值三百美元的日本式小房屋现在索价一万美元，美金黑市十六日已较月初上涨一倍。据美联社南京十一日消息称：每周自内地抵达台湾者约达五万人，其中绝大部分是国民党政府官员和他们的家属。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】南京连续爆发公务人员反对国民党匪帮的示威。忙于南逃的南京国民党反动政府曾大肆裁减中下级公务人员，因而激起他们愤怒的抗议。据外国通讯社消息：十九日曾有六百余名被辞退的公务员在伪行政院门前示威，要求国民党政府发给他们充足的返籍旅费和六个月的薪水，同日伪立法院门前亦有数百公务员的示威。二十日伪财政部门前又爆发两千公务员的示威。和国民党匪帮的惊慌逃亡相反，据美联社消息披露，一般中下级公务人员“却已不管如何都留在南京”，不愿意跟国民党匪帮南逃已成为中下级公务员间“普遍的情绪”。
