Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Reuter's London dispatch: The British four-year economic recovery plan formulated based on Marshall Aid, which was announced on December 20th of last year, has been fiercely criticized by financial circles and economists of various schools in this city. The plan's advocacy of a continuously decreasing amount of US dollars invested in the economy is based on the following assumptions: 1. Savings remain effective throughout the four-year plan period; 2. Coal production can be increased by nearly a quarter (50 million tons annually); 3. Electricity production increases by half, and agricultural production increases by 50 percent. The plan states: 1949 is the "decisive year" of the overall plan, estimating that "by the end of 1949, if all goes well, it will be possible to see how the future unfolds."

It is believed here that the coal and agricultural production targets in the plan are considered particularly unrealistic in London because the former cannot be achieved without adding 50,000 miners - at a time when military authorities are demanding more manpower - while the latter requires large-scale investment in modernization and mechanization, which has not even been included in the Labor government's plan. Due to the impracticality of the "revival goals" in this plan, the main effort to balance the budget during the four-year period of the Marshall Plan will inevitably launch an offensive against wages and the living conditions of the working class.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS, Brussels dispatch: The "People's Daily" here writes: Among the sixteen plans submitted by the member states of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau," Britain's economic recovery plan for the sterling bloc countries has been subjected to the most severe criticism, especially from France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Right-wing newspapers believe that the British plan is a "power policy" and a "discriminatory tendency." The Liberal Party's "Biennio Herre" newspaper published an article stating that Britain wants to reduce its dollar deficit and improve its balance of payments with Europe at the same time by producing more than before the war and consuming less than before the war. They hope that they will sell more and more goods in both Europe and the Americas. The newspaper pointed out that this British economic recovery plan is nothing more than a continuation of the policy of restricting imports and increasing exports, and nothing else. Belgium cannot agree to the British plan because the sterling bloc countries are Belgium's main debtor countries, so this plan poses a threat to Belgium. The newspaper wrote: In addition to Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, other Western countries are also strongly attacking Britain's plan, which aims to improve Britain's position at the expense of European countries.

　　英制定四年经济计划
  　将向劳动人民实行进攻
    【新华社陕北一日电】电通社伦敦讯：去年十二月二十日公布的根据马歇尔援助制定的英国四年经济复兴计划，受到本市金融界和各种学派的经济学家的激烈抨击。该计划所主张的不断减少投入经济的美元的希望，是根据如下假定：一、整个四年计划期间，节约情况保持有效；二、煤炭生产能够增加近四分之一（每年五千万吨）；三、电力生产增加一半，农业生产增加百分之五十。该计划称：一九四九年是全盘计划的“决定性的一年”，估计“在一九四九年底，如果一切情形良好，则将有可能看清前途如何。”
    此间认为，该计划中之煤炭和农业生产的目标，在伦敦方面被认为是特别不现实的，因为前者不增加五万矿工——在兵役当局要求更大的人力的时候——的额外劳动力，便不能达到，而后者则需要在现代化和机械化上有大规模的投资，但这一点甚至还没有列入工党政府的计划之内。由于这一计划中“复兴目标”的不切实际，因此，在马歇尔计划四年期内平衡预算的主要努力，必将对工资和劳动阶级生活条件实行进攻。
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社布鲁塞尔讯：此间“人民报”写道：在“欧洲经济合作局”会员国所提出的十六个计划中，英国的英镑集团国家经济复兴计划受到最严厉的抨击，特别是法国和比、荷、卢对之批评最甚。右翼报纸认为英国计划是“强权政策”和“歧视倾向”。自由党的“比尼奥·赫尔”报著论称：英国想用生产超过战前，消费低于战前的办法，做到同时削减美元赤字与改善他们对欧洲的收支。他们希望他们在欧美两洲销出的货物量愈来愈多。该报指出：这个英国经济复兴计划无非就是限制输入和增加输出政策的继续，再没有别的。比利时不能同意英国的计划，因为英镑集团国家是比利时主要的债务国，所以这个计划成为对比利时的威胁。该报写道：除了比、荷、卢三国之外，其他西方国家也极力攻击英国这个以牺牲欧洲国家来改善英国地位为目的的计划。
