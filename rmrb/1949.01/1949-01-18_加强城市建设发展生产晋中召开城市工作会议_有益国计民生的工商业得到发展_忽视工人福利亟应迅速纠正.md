To strengthen leadership over urban work, the Jinzhong Administrative Office convened a conference on the 10th of last month with responsible comrades from Pingyao, Fenyang, Yuci, Xinxian, and Mengxian counties and cities, as well as the heads of industry and commerce sections from three special districts, and representatives from banks, trade departments, and public security bureaus. The purpose was to review the work of major cities in the Jinzhong area since liberation and to determine the current tasks for urban work in the Jinzhong region. Prior to the meeting, the leadership organized an urban work investigation team to conduct research in Pingyao and Yuci to understand the situation. During the meeting, discussions were held based on the investigation materials, and work tasks were defined.

After the liberation of the Jinzhong area, we entered the cities and quickly stabilized social order, protecting the lives and property of industrialists, businessmen, and people from all walks of life. We abolished the Yan Xishan regime's various exorbitant taxes and levies, and initially improved people's lives. This dispelled some of the concerns of urban residents about us, allowing industry and commerce to initially recover and develop. According to a survey in Pingyao City, by the end of November, the number of handicraft businesses had increased from 132 before liberation to 354. Commercial businesses and small vendors increased from 329 to 752. In total, the number of industrial and commercial businesses increased from 461 to 1,106. Therefore, ordinary citizens reflected, "The Communist Party has a way to manage cities, and prices are stable." The recovered and developed industries and businesses are all beneficial to the national welfare and people's livelihood. The fastest-growing sector in handicrafts is the cotton weaving industry. In Pingyao City, there were only 20 cotton weaving businesses before liberation, but now there are 118. The city has 93 looms, 34 towel machines, and 90 hosiery machines. They produce 80 bolts of foreign cloth, 100 dozen towels, and over 300 dozen socks daily. As the cotton weaving industry gradually developed, the handicraft machinery repair industry also increased from eight to 35 businesses. In addition, eight new small iron factories and saltpeter refineries were established, the fur industry increased from five to 23 businesses, and the hemp rope industry increased from three to eight businesses. In the commercial sector, the fastest-growing businesses were state-owned goods stores. Warehouses and grocery stalls have increased two to three times compared to the past. Other businesses, such as dim sum and candy stores, tea shops, and large restaurants, have gradually decreased. In addition, the Jinzhong Bank and trade departments, in addition to clearing out counterfeit currency and promoting local currency in various cities, provided substantial loans to legitimate industrialists and businessmen, absorbed idle funds for development of production, and basically stabilized prices, adjusted market needs, and supplied the masses with large quantities of food, oil, salt, and other necessities. They organized merchants from the old liberated areas to do business in the new areas, thereby revitalizing the market. Therefore, ordinary citizens reflected that there were many goods, prices were not high, and supplies came from reliable sources in the liberated areas.

However, due to insufficient attention paid to urban work by the leadership and certain ideological biases, urban work still had several shortcomings. For example, from the city and county level to the special district and administrative office, the organizations leading industrial and commercial work were not sound. Even to this day, some cities have not assigned cadres to industrial and commercial work. The relationship between the city and various local agencies is also unclear, especially the leadership relationship with the county, resulting in "dead ends" in some work. The cadres doing industrial and commercial work at the lower levels have confused ideas and have great blindness in their work, failing to effectively implement policies and prioritize the development of industries and businesses that are necessary for mass production and livelihood. They emphasize commerce over industry. For example, in Pingyao City, industrial loans accounted for only 15 percent of the total industrial and commercial loans, while commercial loans accounted for 85 percent. The highest industrial loan was only 3.5 million Jibi, while the commercial loan was 15 million. Loan situations in Yuci City and other places were similar. Currently, the cotton weaving industry in Pingyao City is facing shutdowns due to a lack of raw materials; sales difficulties in Yuci City have also affected production. More importantly, various cities have failed to effectively organize and lead workers, urban poor, and independent laborers to the production front, develop production, and build cities together. Workers, the poor, and small vendors account for about 70 percent of the population of Pingyao City, and many of them are still unemployed. For example, there are eight households on 13th Street who have no houses, no land, and no jobs. Due to the insufficient attention paid to urban work by the leadership in various places, especially the neglect of the working class, trade unions have not been established in a timely manner. Therefore, the old guild system exerts considerable feudal oppression on workers, shop assistants, and apprentices, preventing workers and other laborers from obtaining the necessary guarantees for their livelihoods. For example, the highest wages for cotton weaving workers in Pingyao and Yuci, excluding meals, are one dan of rice per month, while the lowest wages are less than several dou. The situation is even worse for outside workers and female workers, and they are not paid in kind, resulting in significant losses. In particular, the regulations on wages and working hours are even more unreasonable. For example, the Cotton Weaving Guild in Pingyao City stipulates that wages should be low rather than high within the industry, and the Zhang family's workers are not allowed to be hired by the Li family. Working hours are based on "standard output," resulting in working hours of up to 15 or 16 hours, severely limiting workers' time for social activities. Workers in Pingyao City reflected that "standard output even includes time for urination, and wage deductions are made for work delays due to machine repairs." Workers in Yuci City reflected that "although progressive wages are beneficial, there is no labor protection." Currently, workers demand that factory owners should provide meals when they are sick, and they propose the establishment of trade unions as soon as possible to protect workers' interests and help workers make political progress. In addition, there is a lack of a clear attitude towards labor-capital relations, and the economic protection of private capitalists lacks differentiation, so that certain speculative phenomena that take advantage of the war have not been stopped in a timely manner. Some cadres even have right-leaning ideas and do not listen enough to the voices of workers and laborers. They believe that if the old and larger industrial and commercial capitalists do not resume operations in a timely manner or are stimulated, the city cannot be well built, production cannot be developed, and the economy cannot be prosperous, which is a wrong view.

After the above review in the meeting, in addition to determining effective and specific corrective measures, urban policies were also studied and discussed. After research and determination by the Administrative Office's Political Affairs Council, it was determined that the construction of cities in the future should be based on the New Democratic economic guiding principle of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," and no deviation is allowed. The unification of urban work should be strengthened, democratic organizations should be established and improved, and all possible forces should be organized in a planned and purposeful manner into the production front. The development of industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national welfare and people's livelihood and have development prospects should be led in an organized and planned manner. Merchants who sell luxury goods and superstitious items should be given appropriate education and encouraged to switch industries under the principle of self-reliance. At the same time, according to the specific conditions at that time and place, the improvement of backward production methods should be organized and led, and advanced production methods should be supported and rewarded. The close connection between urban and rural areas should be strengthened, and the supply of raw materials and sales of finished products in urban and rural areas should be organized, so that the development of industry and agriculture can be reliably based on the development of legitimate commerce. On the other hand, the organizations of workers and laborers must be established as soon as possible. Only in this way can the improvement of the lives of laborers and the prosperity of the economy be guaranteed. The legitimate economic activities of industrialists and businessmen should be resolutely protected, their concerns should be dispelled, and their capital should be used to develop production under the correct leadership of our democratic government. Appropriate improvement of the treatment of workers and the raising of the status of workers should be done to jointly increase production. In short, everything must correctly reflect the principle of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," and no separate interpretation or one-sided emphasis is allowed. The meeting also discussed the leading position of the state-owned economy, the role of the cooperative economy, and the relationship with the private economy.

　　加强城市建设发展生产晋中召开城市工作会议
  　有益国计民生的工商业得到发展
    忽视工人福利亟应迅速纠正
    【本报讯】晋中行署为了加强对城市工作的领导，特于上月十日召集平遥、汾阳、榆次、忻县、盂县等县市及三个专署工商科长和银行、贸易、公安局等负责同志，检查自晋中解放以来各主要城市的工作，确定晋中区当前城市工作的任务。会前，领导上为掌握情况，特组织城市工作调查组，赶赴平遥、榆次进行调查。会中根据调查材料，展开讨论，定出工作任务。
    晋中区解放后，我们进入城市，迅速的安定了社会秩序，保护了工商业及各阶层人民的生命财产；废除了阎匪的各种苛捐杂税，初步改善了人民生活。解除了城市人民对我某些顾虑，使工商业得到初步的恢复与发展。据平遥市的调查，至十一月底，手工业由解放前一百三十二家增至三百五十四家。商业及小摊贩由三百二十九家，增至七百五十二家。总计工商业由原四百六十一家，增至一千一百零六家。所以一般市民反映：“共产党管理城市有办法，物价稳。”恢复与发展的工商业，都是有利于国计民生的。手工业方面发展最快的是棉织业。平遥市的棉织业，解放前只二十家，现已增至一百一十八家。全市织布机九十三架，毛巾机三十四架，织袜机九十架。每日出洋布八十匹，毛巾百打，袜子三百余打。因为棉织业逐渐发展，手工业机器修理业也由八家增至三十五家。此外，小型铁工厂与熬硝厂新增八家，皮毛业由五家增至二十三家，麻绳业由三家增至八家。商业方面发展最快的为国货庄。货栈与杂货摊，均较原来增加二倍到三倍。其他如点心糖果铺、茶店与大饭庄，则逐渐减少。此外，晋中银行与贸易部门，在各城市除肃清伪币，推行本币外，予正当工商业者以大量贷款，吸收游资用于发展生产，基本上做到了稳定物价，调剂市场需要，供给了群众大批食粮、油盐等必需品。组织老区商人到新区经商，从而繁荣了市场。所以一般市民反映，解放区货不少、价不高、有来路。
    由于领导上对城市工作还重视不够和思想上某些偏差，因而使城市工作还存在着若干缺点。例如：从市、县、专区到行署，领导工商工作的机构都不健全，甚至直到目前尚有某些城市，未配备起工商业工作的干部。市与当地各个机关部门的关系也不明确，特别是与县的领导关系不明确，以致在某些工作上造成“死角”。下边做工商工作的干部，思想混乱，工作中存在着极大的盲目性，不能很好的贯彻政策，有重点的发展有利于群众生产及生活必需的工商业。而是轻工业重商业，如平遥市的工商贷款中，工业贷款仅占总数的百分之十五，商业贷款却占了百分之八十五；工贷款最多者仅为冀钞三百五十万元，商贷则为一千五百万元。榆次市等地贷款也与此类似。目前平遥市棉织工业因原料缺乏，已有停工现象；榆次市因成品推销不畅，也影响了生产。更重要的是各个城市都未能很好的组织领导工人、与城市贫民，独立劳动者等到生产战线上来，发展生产，共同建设城市。平遥市的工人贫民与小商贩，占全市人口百分之七十左右，其中仍有不少失业者。如十三街无房无地无业者即有八家。由于各地领导上对城市工作重视不够，尤其对工人阶级的忽视，因而工会未及时建立，所以旧的行会制度对工人、店员、学徒的封建压迫，相当严重，致使工人及其他劳动者不能得到生活上应有的保障。例如平遥、榆次的棉织业工人最高工资除吃饭外，每月赚一石米，低者不及数斗。至于外工及女工较一般工人更差，且不以实物计价，吃亏甚大。特别是对工资与工时的规定更不合理，如平遥市棉织业行会，规定同业工资准低不准高，张家的工人李家不准雇用。工时以“标准产量”为准，以致工作时间达十五、六小时之多，使工人参加社会活动的时间受到极大的限制。平遥市工人反映：“标准产量，连小便时间也计算在内，修理机子误工也扣工钱。”榆次工人反映：“累进工资虽则有利，但没劳工保护。”现工人要求，除生病厂主应当管吃饭外，并提出尽速建立工会，以便保护工人利益，并从政治上帮助工人进步。此外在劳资关系上也缺乏明确的态度，对私人资本家的经济上的保护，缺乏分别对待，以致对某些利用战争投机现象未能及时予以制止。甚至有部分干部带有右倾思想，听取工人、劳动者的呼声不够。认为旧的较大的工商业资本家不及时复业或者受到刺激，便不能很好建设城市发展生产与繁荣经济，这是错误的观点。
    会中经过以上的检查，除确定有效的具体改正办法外，并学习与讨论城市政策，经行署政务会研讨确定——今后建设城市应根据“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的新民主主义的经济指导方针，不许有任何违背；加强城市工作的统一，建立与健全民主机构，有计划有目的的组织一切可能的力量到生产战线中来。有组织、有计划的领导发展有利于国计民生的、并有发展前途的工业与商业。对贩卖奢侈品与迷信品等商户应予适当教育，在自顾原则下促其转业。同时根据当时当地的具体条件，组织与领导改进落后的生产方式，扶植与奖励进步的生产方式。加强城乡的密切联系，组织城乡的原料供给与成品的推销，使工农业得到真正的发展后正当商业的发展才有可靠的依据。另一方面，工人与劳动人民的组织，须尽速建立起来。只有这样，劳动人民的生活改善与繁荣经济才有保障。对工商业者的正当经济活动应予以坚决保护，解除其顾虑，在我民主政府正确领导下，使其资财用于发展生产。适当的改善对工人的待遇并提高工人地位，共同增加生产。总之一切必须正确的体现“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针，不许割开解释，片面强调。会中并讨论了国营经济的领导地位与合作经济的作用及对私人经济的关系等。
