Battlefield First Aid Method
    Qian Xinzhong

    Editor's Note: Comrade Qian Xinzhong's "Battlefield First Aid Method" is based on his rich battlefield rescue experience, specifically and concisely introducing all battlefield rescue work. Many methods are relatively simple and easy to implement, and should be understood not only by medical and health personnel engaged in battlefield rescue work; among them, such as bandaging methods and hemostasis methods, all commanders and fighters of combat troops, stretcher-bearing laborers and militiamen at the front line, and armed work team personnel in marginal areas, should learn and be able to master these methods, for emergency needs. The full text is introduced as follows:

    I. Mutual Aid Bandaging Method

    After being wounded, the first bandaging is very important. Early and appropriate bandaging eliminates a lot of pain, prevents the wound from festering and bleeding. Whether the wound heals quickly or slowly and how much pain is suffered is determined by this key. Improper bandaging can also affect disability and life. Therefore, every health worker and health soldier must learn bandaging, and all comrades in combat troops must learn it. The simple method is provided below:

    1.  Maintain disinfection. Do not touch the gauze pad covering the wound with your hands, let alone touch the wound with your hands. Even in the dark, try to pay attention as much as possible, because touching it dirty will cause the wound to hurt, become inflamed, fester, and heal slowly.
    2.  The bandage should be wrapped evenly, firmly, tightly, and closely. This reduces bleeding and pain, and dust is not easy to get in. Bandaging methods for each part: Limb bandages, like wrapping leggings, each circle presses two-thirds of each circle, or wraps in a figure-eight shape, such as the thigh, calf, and each joint, all wrapped into a large figure-eight bandage, wrapping up and down in a crosswise manner, so that it is not easy to fall off. Bandages on the body: each circle presses two-thirds of each circle, bundling from top to bottom. For the chest, a suspender can also be added, that is, first use a bandage to hang around the neck, one end from the front of the chest under the navel, and the other end to under the breast, tie the long end, and when the bandage is wrapped, tie the long and short ends together to hang and not easily fall off. Head bandage: You can use a square cloth to cover the gauze, and then use a bandage to wrap around the forehead and back of the head to tie the cloth, or use a four-corner scarf, cross-tie the four corners, tie two corners at the back of the neck, and tie the other two ends under the jaw. Jaw bandage: Tear the two ends of the bandage open. Cross-tie on the top of the head, two bandages in front of the ears, and two bandage ends behind the ears, crossing to prevent slipping. Eye bandage: Also use a bandage torn at both ends, leaving a good eye, cross-tie on the side of the head above and below the ear. Abdominal and waist bandage: It is best to use a multi-tailed bandage, that is, a large rectangular cloth, with six to eight strips torn at both ends, without tearing through the middle. First place it under the wounded's body, and the forked bands at both ends should be aligned and pressed one by one. The last strip is fastened with a safety pin, or tied together. If there is no such bandage, a wide and long bandage can be used in the same way as the chest.
    3.  Do not tie the bandage outside the clothes: As long as conditions permit, the clothes should be taken off, or the clothes and trouser legs should be cut open. Cut or tear along the seams of the clothes, which is easy and saves money. However, when taking off or cutting clothes, first press the wound with a piece of gauze, otherwise it is easy to get dirty, suffer more pain, and bleed more.
    4.  Wounded people with broken bones should be especially careful. After wrapping the bandage, tie a rifle or bayonet scabbard to the outside of the leg for the lower limbs, and then tie the injured leg to the good leg. If it is an upper limb, tie it firmly to the torso (that is, the chest). By doing this, even moving it a little will not be very painful and reduce the danger. If the bone tip pierces into the muscle, the pain is unbearable, and it pierces a large blood vessel, causing massive bleeding, there will be more trouble later. I hope everyone practices and becomes familiar with this operation. This is very important.
    5.  Everyone learns, and everyone's mutual aid bandaging is beneficial to everyone. The medical personnel of each battalion should actively teach every commander and fighter, especially the health workers and health soldiers, to learn how to tie simple bandages, which can reduce the death, disability, and pain of wounded soldiers on the battlefield. Therefore, launching a universal bandaging movement is extremely important.

    II. Emergency Hemostasis Method

    1. Types of bleeding: Divided into arterial bleeding, venous bleeding, and capillary parenchymal bleeding. Arterial bleeding, the blood image is a spraying fountain, generally spraying out quickly, the blood is bright red. Venous bleeding, parenchymal bleeding, the blood flows out more slowly, not as bright red as arterial blood.
    2. Hemostasis is a very important thing, and there should be no half-minute delay. If you encounter a wounded person bleeding, first use a clean towel, or gauze pad or bandage from the emergency kit, cover the bleeding wound, press it tightly with both hands, press it for ten minutes, and then slowly relax a little to see if it is still bleeding. If it does not bleed, wrap the bandage tightly, add a splint or rifle, etc., fix the injured limb, raise the limb, and slowly move the wounded person.
    3. Various methods of hemostasis: (A) Pressure hemostasis method: As mentioned above, first apply pressure to the wound, and then use a tight and stable pressure bandage. Most bleeding can be stopped by the pressure bandage method; (B) Lifting hemostasis method: That is, after using a pressure bandage, raising the injured limb often has a surprising effect. (C) Tourniquet, used when it is necessary. Use a rubber band, or bicycle inner tube, or wide cloth strip to tie tightly to the upper end of the bleeding part, but it must be tied tightly, otherwise it will cause more bleeding. Because the tying is not tight enough, the returning blood vessels are compressed, while the outgoing blood vessels are still bleeding (that is, the veins are compressed but not the arteries). (D) Finger-pressure emergency hemostasis method: If you encounter a large blood vessel bleeding, in order to temporarily prevent blood loss, you must use your finger to press the incoming route of the blood vessel. When pressing, use both hands, that is, use one hand to press the blood vessel, and the other hand to apply pressure on top of it, so as not to loosen after fatigue and not be able to last. Now, the hemostasis methods for each part are listed below: (1) The upper limb has four pressure hemostasis points; the first pressure hemostasis point; in the center under the clavicle, use the thumb to press down and inward on the large blood vessel under the clavicle. The second pressure hemostasis point; in the armpit, insert the second, third, and fourth fingers into the armpit, press the thumb on the shoulder inward and upward to the bone (humerus), which can compress the bleeding on the upper arm. The third pressure hemostasis point; wrapped in the inner groove of the inner side of the upper arm (inner groove of the biceps), press inward on the upper arm bone, which can compress the pulsating blood vessel below. The fourth pressure hemostasis point: in the middle of the elbow bend slightly inward (that is, the inner side of the biceps tendon of the elbow joint), press down to stop the bleeding of the forearm. (2) The lower limb has two pressure hemostasis points: the first pressure hemostasis point, at the pulsating point in the center of the thigh root, press outward and backward (that is, one inch slightly lower than the center of the groin). The second pressure hemostasis point is slightly to the outside in the popliteal fossa. With the patient in the prone position, press forward to stop the bleeding in the calf. (3) Head and face bleeding; the blood vessels on both sides of the neck can be pressed. When pressing, press backward and inward, do not press the trachea, and the patient cannot breathe. (4) Buttock bleeding: A pillow can be placed under the navel, and the knees can be knelt on the pillow to press down and stop the bleeding. This method is easy for thin people, but difficult for fat people.

　　战地救护法
    钱信忠
    编者按：钱信忠同志这篇“战地救护法”，是根据他丰富的战地救护经验，具体而扼要的介绍了全部战地救护工作，许多方法比较简单易行，不仅从事战地救护工作的医务卫生人员应当懂得；其中如裹伤法、止血法等，全体战斗部队的指战员，身临火线的担架民工民兵，及边缘地区武装工作队人员，都应该学会并且能够学会这些办法，以备急时之需。特将全文介绍如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    一、互助裹伤法
    负伤后，第一次里伤很重要，裹得早而恰当，免去了许多痛苦，使伤口不化脓，不流血，是伤口好得快慢受痛苦多少的决定关键，裹不好还能影响到残废及生命。因而每个卫生员，卫生战士，都要学会包扎，全体战斗部队的同志，都得学会，今将简单的方法，提供于下：
    一、要保持消毒，不要用手摸盖伤口的纱布块，更不要用手摸伤口，即使黑夜能注意尽量注意，因为摸脏了就会使伤口痛、发炎、化脓、好得慢。
    二、缠绷带要平、要稳、要紧、要严密，这样少流血，少受痛，尘土也不容易进去。各部绷带缠的方法：四肢绷带，象缠裹腿一样，每圈压住每圈的三分之二，或缠成八字形，如大腿、小腿肚、各关节部，都缠成大八字形绷带，上下来回交叉的缠，才不易脱落。身体上的绷带：一圈压一圈的三分之二，由上往下捆，胸部还可以加一条吊带，即先用一条绷带挂在脖子上，一端由胸前肚脐下，一端到乳房下，捆住长的一端，候绷带缠好，长短两端结住，使挂住而不易脱落。头部绷带：可用一块四方布，盖在纱布上，再用一条绷带绕前额后头捆住这块布，或用四角巾，四个角交叉捆住，两角结在后头颈部，其他两端结在下颚下。下颚绷带：将绷带两头撕开。交叉结在头顶上，两绷带在耳前，两绷带头在耳后，交叉不致滑脱。眼睛绷带：亦用两头撕开的绷带，留出好眼，在耳上耳下交叉打结在头侧。腹部腰部绷带：最好用多头带，即一大块长方形的大布，两端撕裂成六至八条，中间不要撕通，先放在伤员的身子下，两端开叉之带，对正一个压一个，最后一条用扣针扣住，或者互相结起来，没有这种绷带，可用宽长绷带缠法同胸前。
    三、绷带不要捆在衣服外面：只要条件许可，应将衣服脱去，或剪开衣服和裤腿，要沿着衣服缝剪或撕开，即容易又节省，但脱剪衣服时，先要用块纱布按住伤口，否则容易弄脏，多受痛苦，多流血。
    四、骨头打断的伤员，更要特别小心，缠好绷带后，下肢用一步枪，或刺刀鞘，捆在腿的外侧，把伤腿再捆到好腿上，若是上肢的话，就稳稳的捆在躯干上（即胸脯上），这样做，即使搬动一下也不会很痛苦，并减少危险。若骨尖刺入肌肉内。痛不能忍，刺破大血管而大出血，以后麻烦更多，希望大家练习一番，熟习这种操作很重要。
    五、人人学会，大家互助的包扎，对人人有利，各营的医务人员，要积极教会每个指战员，尤其是卫生员与卫生战士，每人学会捆简单的绷带，能减少战场上伤员的死亡、残废与痛苦，因此发动普遍包扎运动，关系极重大。
    二、急救止血法
    一、出血的种类：分动脉出血，静脉出血，毛细管实质出血。动脉出血，血象喷射泉，一般很快的喷出，血色鲜红。静脉出血，实质出血，血流出较缓慢一些，不象动脉血那样鲜红。
    二、止血是一件很重要的事，不应有半分钟的迟慢，如遇到伤员流血，先要用块干净的手巾，或救急包内的纱布块、或绷带，盖在出血的伤口上，用一双手紧紧的压住，压它十分钟，再慢慢的放松一点，看是否还流血，如不流了，就紧紧的缠上绷带，再加一夹板，或步枪等，固定伤肢，高举肢体，慢慢的移动伤员。
    三、止血的各种办法：（甲）止压迫止血法：如上述，在伤口上先加压力，而后用紧而平稳的压迫绷带，大部分出血用压迫绷带法可以止住出血；（乙）高举止血法：即用了压迫绷带后，高举伤肢，往往发生惊人的效力。（丙）止血带，是在不得已时用。用一条橡皮带，或自行车内带，或宽布带在出血部上端紧捆住，但必须捆紧，否则反引起更多的出血。因为捆的不够紧，把回去的血管压住了，而出来的血管，仍在流血（即压住了静脉未压住动脉）。（丁）指压急救止血法：遇见了一个大的血管出血，临时为了防止流血空子，就要用指头压住血管的来路，压时要用一双手压，即用一手压住血管，另一只手加压在上面，免得疲劳后松开，不能持久，今将各部止血法列于下：（一）上肢有四个压迫止血点；第一个压迫止血点；在锁骨下中央，用大拇指向下，内方压住锁骨下的大血管。第二个压迫止血点；在腋窝，用第二三四指插入腋窝中，大拇指压在肩上向里向上压至骨头上（肱骨），即能压住上膊出血。第三个压迫止血点；在上膊内侧肉沟（二头肌内侧沟）裹，向里压迫上膊骨，即能压住下面跳动的血管。第四个压迫止血点：在肘弯正中略靠内侧（即肘关节二头肌腱之内侧），向下压住，即可止住前膊出血。（二）下肢有两个压迫止血点：第一个压迫止血点，在大腿跟正中跳动处，向外后压迫（即鼠蹊部中央略低一寸）。第二个压迫止血点，在膝窝里稍偏外侧一点，病人俯卧位，向前压，即可止住小腿出血。（三）头部面部出血；可压住颈部两侧之血管，压时向后内压，不要压住气管，病人不能出气。（四）臀部出血：可用枕头放在肚脐下，用膝盖跪在枕头上，向下即能压住不出血。这办法，瘦人容易，胖人不易达到目的。
