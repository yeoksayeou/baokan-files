　　North China People's Government Issues Directive to Subordinates
  　Protect Scenic Spots and Historical Sites, Strictly Prohibit Destruction
    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China People's Government, in order to protect scenic spots and historical sites in various places and strictly prohibit destruction, issued a directive on January 14 to governments at all levels above the county level and all departments of the government, as well as directly subordinate organs. The full text of the directive is as follows:
    Our country has scenic spots and historical sites everywhere; they have great value in history, culture, science, and art. These are the cultural property of the people. In the past, due to the devastation of the people by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, many were destroyed and damaged. Also, during the land reform period, some damage occurred due to insufficient care by the government. In order to cherish the people's cultural property, the following provisions are hereby made: (1) All scenic spots and historical sites with historical and cultural value, such as ancient temples, shrines, monasteries, nunneries, pavilions, pagodas, memorial arches, imperial palaces and other buildings, steles, statues, carvings, murals, tombs, excavation sites of ancient relics, special buildings in the former residences of famous people, and their commemorative accessories, etc., shall be under protection. (2) The civil affairs departments of governments at all levels shall concurrently handle the investigation and survey of scenic spots and historical sites within their jurisdictions. The results of the investigation shall be reported to this government at any time. Governments at all levels should pay attention to protection according to the circumstances. (3) The renovation of scenic spots and historical sites should be based on the principle of protection. At present, no renovation or reconstruction should be carried out. The expenses can be paid from local construction grain. If there are special circumstances that require subsidies, a report can be submitted to this government, and it will be resolved as deemed necessary. (4) Local governments shall be responsible for the custody of ancient relics scattered in various places. Those that can be moved, such as steles, statues, and castings, may be moved to scenic spots or ancient relic preservation centers for protection when necessary. (5) Palaces, Taoist temples, temples, and scenic spots of value are prohibited from being demolished or occupied by the army or other organs, and special personnel should be appointed to live and manage them, and take extra care to protect them. The living expenses of the guards should be solved by the local government through its own regulations. Temples without special value should also be regarded as public property and taken care of, and should not be allowed to be destroyed. The above items should be forwarded to subordinates for compliance and execution, and the importance of protecting scenic spots and historical sites should be publicized and explained to the broad masses. Each county should conduct a survey of the scenic spots and historical sites within its jurisdiction and report them to this government for record by the end of April.
