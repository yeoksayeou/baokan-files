　　Massively Train and Promote Cadres
  　Jinzhong First Prefectural Committee Summarizes Cadre Work
  　Transfers Over a Thousand Cadres Throughout the Year
    Experience proves:
    Wherever branch work is strong and Party member education is good, it is easier to promote a large number of cadres.
    [Jinzhong Electric] The First Prefectural Committee here recently summarized the work of promoting, training, and transferring cadres in 1948. The entire district transferred a total of 1,044 cadres at the district level and above throughout the year. From April to October, statistics show that counties promoted 499 cadres and trained 2,275 district and village cadres and Party members in summer and autumn, basically completing the glorious task assigned by the higher-level Party to massively train, promote, and transfer cadres. The following methods were generally used in promoting cadres: First, training and promotion from top to bottom. During the land reform, a large number of activists emerged from the movement, becoming one of the main sources for promoting cadres. Second, according to the criteria of virtue, talent, and qualifications for promoting cadres, the higher levels put forward a certain number of promotions, and each county and district, based on the activists they discovered and understood, conducted promotions after discussions by village branches and approval by the leadership. Third, small training classes were organized in a planned manner. After discovering and selecting candidates in the training classes, they were first used in a concentrated manner, and then formally promoted after a period of work testing. However, there are still many problems and shortcomings in training, promoting, and transferring cadres: First, in the work of transferring a large number of cadres, the understanding of the new and old cadres in all aspects is not profound enough, so the handling of cadre issues is sometimes not appropriate. For example, in the transfer of cadres, more consideration was given to completing tasks, and insufficient attention was paid to the physical illnesses and special difficulties of cadres, so many problems arose. In particular, ideological mobilization to raise cadres' awareness from a positive perspective was very poor, and even some methods were simple, without patiently conducting education. Second, in the transfer of cadres, it was not ensured that the work in the old areas would not be affected by the transfer of cadres. For example, in Meng County, Dingxiang, and Pingding, when transferring cadres, no attention was paid to promptly promoting and training new cadres, so later in the work, they deeply felt that there were too few key leading cadres. Some places were also eager to complete the task of transferring cadres, neglecting quality and mobilization methods. For example, in order to promote cadres, they privately wooed and introduced people to join the Party, without following the Party constitution, and even promoted those with unclear political backgrounds. As a result, promotions were fast, but purging was also fast. Third, attention was only paid to promotion, and insufficient attention was paid to the education of both old and newly promoted cadres, failing to effectively improve their level of political theory. Fourth, insufficient attention was paid to women cadres, believing that women cadres did not progress as quickly as male cadres, and were troublesome and verbose. The summary also studied several experiences in the work of training, promoting, and transferring cadres in the past year: First, constant attention to cadre education and understanding the situation of cadres at all levels and Party members in local branches at any time and anywhere are necessary to correctly promote and use cadres. Experience proves that wherever branch work is strong and Party member education is good, it is easier to promote a large number of cadres; otherwise, not only will it be impossible to transfer cadres in large numbers, but even filling one's own vacancies will be difficult. Second, selecting activists in the branch, promoting cadres from the bottom up after mass deliberation and discussion is one of the best methods. Third, the promotion of cadres must have a clear class viewpoint, and the main criteria should be the study of proletarian ideology and the Party's policies and guidelines, as well as the ability to connect with the masses. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent simple component-ism and pay attention to promoting young intellectuals.

　　大量培养提拔干部
  　晋中一地委总结干部工作
  　全年输送干部千余
    经验证明：
    哪个地方支部工作强党员教育好，哪里便容易提拔大量干部。
    【晋中电】此间一地委日前总结一九四八年提拔培养输送干部工作。全分区全年共输送区级以上的干部一千零四十四名。四月至十月统计：各县提拔干部四百九十九名，夏秋两季集训区村干部党员二千二百七十五人，基本上完成了上级党给予大量培养、提拔与输送干部的光荣任务。在提拔干部上一般采用了如下方法：一、自上而下培养提拔。在土改时从运动中涌现出大批积极分子，成为提拔干部主要来源之一。二、根据提拔干部德、才、资的标准，由上而下的提出一定的提拔数目，各县区根据所发现了解的积极分子，经过村支部的讨论及领导上批准而进行提拔。三、有组织有计划的开办小型训练班，在训练班中发现与选拔对象后，首先集中使用，经过一个时期的工作考验，然后再正式提拔。但在培养提拔输送干部中，还存在着不少问题与缺点：一、大批输送干部工作中，对新老干部各方面的了解极不深刻，因而有时处理干部问题不够适当。如在输送干部中多从完成任务着想，对干部之身体疾病特殊困难，照顾不够，所以产生不少问题。特别是从积极方面提高干部觉悟进行思想动员很差，甚至有的方式简单，没有耐心进行教育。二、在输送干部中没有做到输出干部又不使老区工作受到损失。如孟县、定襄、平定，在输出干部中，没有注意随即提拔与培养新干部，以致后来在工作中深感主要领导干部太少。也有些地方急于完成输出干部任务，忽视了质量与动员方式，如为了提拔干部，便私人拉拢介绍入党，不按党章办事，甚至有的将政治面貌不清的也提拔了，结果是提拔的快，洗刷的也快。三、只注意了提拔，而对于旧有的与新提拔的在职干部的教育注意不够，没有很好的提高政治理论水平。四、对妇女干部重视不够，认为妇女干部不如男干部进步快；又麻烦又罗嗦。总结中并研究了在过去一年来培养提拔输出干部工作的几点经验：一、经常注意干部教育，随时随地去了解熟悉各级干部与各地支部党员情况，才能正确的提拔使用干部。经验证明：哪个地方支部工作强，党员教育好，哪里便易提拔出大批干部；否则不仅不能大批地输出干部，连补足自己的空额亦感困难。二、选择支部中的积极分子，经过群众酝酿讨论，由下而上的提拔干部是最好的方法之一。三、提拔干部必须有明确的阶级观点，要以无产阶级的思想与对党的政策路线的学习及能否联系群众为主要标准，同时必须防止单纯的唯成份论，要注意提拔青年知识分子。
