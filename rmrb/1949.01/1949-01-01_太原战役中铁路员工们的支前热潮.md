　　Railway Workers' Support-the-Frontline Upsurge in the Taiyuan Campaign
　　Ma Ming Fan Haoran
　　The Datong-Pukou Railway's Jinzhong section, painstakingly repaired and reopened by the workers in August of this year, played a significant role in supporting the war during the Taiyuan Campaign. Over the past three months, thanks to the efforts of the railway workers, 90,000 tons of military supplies have been transported, saving over 17.8 million labor days of civilian manpower. In October alone, there were 501 train runs in both directions, covering a distance of 25,860 kilometers, transporting 44,944 tons of military supplies, ensuring supplies for the front lines. It was commended at the Taiyuan Campaign Logistics Conference at the end of November.
　　(1) All-Out Repair Enables the Victorious Advance of the People's Liberation Army!
　　With the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, the workers at all stations and sections automatically guarded locomotives, resisting the enemy's reactionary order of "thorough destruction," and took out preserved equipment and tools to actively repair the railway. Wang Yuxi, Jia Xingdu, Fan Qun, and others, workers from the Taigu electrical section who were forced away by the enemy and seized the opportunity to escape back from the Wuma River, carried a rifle, a telephone, and other items. They immediately connected the telephone lines between Taigu and Dongguan and handed over a large number of batteries to the public. The tools of the engineering section, under the conscientious protection of material worker Ran Wencheng, remained intact. Some workers handed over equipment and tools accumulated over many years. On July 15th (the third day after the liberation of Taigu), the intense work of repairing the railway began. They dispatched two engineering teams: one heading south from Taigu and the other heading north from Jiexiu, converging at Qi County. At the beginning, the workers were unfamiliar with us due to the enemy's long-term deception and propaganda. Coupled with the Yan bandit's three "reductions," some were laid off with pay suspended, and some had both job and pay suspended, making life difficult. After our railway bureau explained our Party's policy towards workers and implemented a temporary measure of four catties of wheat per person per day, and from October onward, salaries were paid according to each person's original position and base salary. In addition, coal and rice were given as preferential subsidies, and the workers' lives were guaranteed, leading to extremely high morale. The engineering section repaired roads and erected bridges; the electrical section hurried to erect wires along the route. Drivers, stokers, and traffic clerks from the locomotive section also helped to carry sleepers. Li Jianli, a carpenter by trade, seized every opportunity to make sixty handles for picks, hammers, and shovels. The required screws, spikes, fishplates, and tools were gradually resolved through the workers' collection and production efforts. In order to expedite the reopening of the railway, they got up at 5 a.m. and rested at 11 p.m. every day, working diligently in the face of enemy planes bombing and strafing. They said, "When the Yan bandits were around, we only did half a day's work, mostly perfunctorily. Now we don't go back until the work is finished." At the same time, farmers, women, and children along the Yushu, Taigu, Qi, Pingyao, and Jiexiu lines delivered 20,000 sawn sleepers and dismantled rails accumulated over the years to the route in the midst of busy support-the-frontline work. When repairing the Changyuan River Bridge (two holes collapsed into the river) between Taigu and Dongguan, it was estimated that more than a thousand sacks of soil would be needed to fill the bridge foundation before the rails could be laid. However, after the workers researched and came up with a simple solution, they immediately pushed two carloads of stones to replace the soil. It was raining that day, and everyone jumped into the waist-deep river to carry out the repair. The entire section, two kilometers in total, with 300 meters of roadbed and two bridges, would have taken at least seven days in the past. Now, it was completed in three days. When the Xiangyu River Bridge between Yuci and Taigu was being repaired, two holes were broken, and there were no stones to fill the bridge foundation. The workers immediately demolished the Yan bandit's blockhouse next to the bridge, and more than fifty people completed the work in one day. In the Yan bandit era, a similar project was carried out once, with more than eighty workers and more than fifty civilian laborers, taking two days and two nights to barely complete. Thanks to the efforts of the railway workers, twenty-six kilometers of broken road and thirty-two bridges of all sizes were successfully repaired within nineteen days, achieving the official opening of the Yuci-Lingshi section on August 9th, and beginning to undertake military transport tasks.
　　(2) Everything to Ensure the Completion of Military Transport
　　In supporting the Taiyuan Campaign, the entire line of 160 kilometers gradually increased its workforce to 1,535 people. Some stations lacked station buildings, had simple equipment, and the number of personnel was only one-third of what it was before the War of Resistance. Most of the locomotives and cars were dilapidated, and enemy planes constantly damaged them, but the workers were not discouraged. During the busy military transport in October, there were sixteen train runs up and down the line every night. Workers at stations along the line broke the system of working once every other day to make up for the shortage of manpower. Sun Songxi, deputy chief of the Transportation Section (and director of the Dispatching Office), and dispatchers Guo Yucheng and Gao Zhong personally managed train dispatching by telephone throughout the night. Comrade Sun Changchun, a secretary from the military transportation office sent to the railway by the Taiyuan Campaign Logistics Command, could only rest for three or four hours a day, which led to weight loss and illness due to overwork, but he still insisted on working. Driver Yue Shunxing had a glass tube suddenly break during a train run, but he still tried every means to avoid an accident and reached his destination. When enemy planes attacked Taigu Station, smoke was billowing from the locomotive. Wang Baoshan fearlessly extinguished the fire and covered the target. In order to ensure the safety of the locomotives, the track team at the station automatically worked three extra night shifts to complete the air defense facilities. One day, due to heavy rain, the river water rose sharply. Thanks to the conscientious guarding of the worker Liu Maicheng, he immediately repaired the ignition and called everyone to rush the repairs, ensuring smooth traffic. Craftsman Sun Pinshan and two others welded four destroyed large smoke pipes, ten superheater pipes, five small smoke pipes, and one boiler plug in two days. In the case of insufficient vehicles, they adopted two ways to overcome difficulties in rushing to transport equipment: First, they maintained close contact with the logistics equipment stations along the line, improved loading and unloading technology, and increased the number of train runs. The number of trains running up and down the line increased from 289 in September to 501 in October, averaging sixteen strong trains per night. Lingshi increased each carload of door panels from over 300 pieces to 620 pieces, and Dongyang increased each carload of straw from over 4,000 catties to over 14,000 catties. After the restoration of W 숙 Station, station master Song Zhengming worked with the local logistics unit's equipment station to improve loading and unloading work, saving a lot of civilian manpower. The second way to overcome the problem was to restore and repair locomotives and cars that had been derailed for a long time since liberation. On October 4th, the Taigu Locomotive Section and the Yuci Substation repaired the "1510" locomotive and two cars in Mingli. At that time, enemies still lived in W 숙 and occasionally fired artillery shells. They said, "According to this situation, in the past, at least one armored train would have to be escorted, and it would take four days to complete." But now, regardless of the artillery fire and enemy air raids, they used manual pressing machines and completed the task ahead of schedule. When Chen Yuqi, the foreman, was pressing the machine, his head was broken by the rails and he bled non-stop. Zhu Gengtang, a coal carrier, had his toes crushed by a 150-pound sleeper. They both bandaged themselves slightly and insisted on working until the completion. After the "1510" locomotive was pulled to Jiexiu, more than 100 parts were bent, broken, and missing. After six days of rush repairs by Gao Danqi, Tian Lianxiang, and craftsmen Sun Pinshan and others from the locomotive section, it was able to operate as usual.
　　(3) Give Full Play to Creativity and Overcome All Difficulties
　　In overcoming the difficulties of equipment and raw materials, the workers thought of everything: the asbestos rope gasket on the water tower and boiler plug in Taigu was broken. Because of the leakage, it would soon affect the water supply task. At this time, the old worker Ren Shuangyin carefully studied and used bricks to carve a model, found waste lead to cast a lead gasket (he didn't originally know sand casting technology), saving the crisis. He said, "In the past, we had to replace the asbestos rope once a month, but now we can use it for at least three months!" Liu Shengxuan, acting section chief of the Jiexiu Locomotive Section, used jujube wood carvings to replace the eight missing lead pieces in the locomotive cylinder. Repairman Zhang Xiushan modified the drain door inside the air chamber of the "1510" locomotive. The six cars pulled from Qi County to Taigu could not move due to the lack of forty oil pads and two axle boxes on the cars. Foreman Yan Shuangwu led everyone to clean the axle parts to reduce friction and used eight oil pads. In addition, wooden axle tiles were used to replace iron axle tiles, ensuring the safe return of the cars. Oil was generally lacking on locomotives, and workers used emulsified oil with lime water to replace it. In addition, a substitute was made from 80% sesame oil and 20% axle oil. In addition, tin was used to replace nonferrous metal pipes (with a small hole), glass tubes (water gauges), hemp ropes replaced asbestos ropes, and hard dry oil mixed with axle oil replaced soft dry oil. Many things that were missing or had become waste were utilized again through the hard work and creativity of workers and technicians. The railway workers generally reflected, "When the Yan bandits were around, if the vehicles were broken, they would be sent to the Taiyuan factory for repair. Now we ourselves are the factory repair shop!"
　　(4) Fight to Wherever We Go, Open Up to Wherever We Go
　　Although the Mingli Station, more than eight kilometers north of Yuci, was threatened by artillery fire, the workers actively persisted in conducting surveying and restoration work. The day after the liberation of W 숙, the three-li road to Yuci was opened to traffic. One day, under enemy air raids, the North Camp Station, only eight kilometers away from Taiyuan City, was renovated and extended in one day. Closely following the advance of the troops, we fought to wherever we went, and repaired to wherever we went, and the train went to wherever we went, transporting a large amount of grain and vegetables to the front.

　　太原战役中铁路员工们的支前热潮
    马明  范浩然
    今年八月间，由员工艰苦抢修恢复通车的同浦铁路晋中段，在太原战役中，发挥了支援战争的重大作用。三个月来，由于该路员工的努力，已完成了九万吨军用物资的运输工作，节省民力一千七百八十余万个工。以十月份为例，上下行车五百零一次，行程二万五千八百六十公里，军运四万四千九百四十四吨，保证了前方供给。十一月底，太原战役后勤会议上，受到大会表扬。
    （一）全力抢修让解放军胜利挺进！
    随着解放军的胜利进军，各站段的员工，自动守护机车，抗拒敌人“彻底破坏”的反动命令，并纷纷拿出保存的器材、工具，积极修路。被敌逼走至乌马河畔乘机逃回之太谷电气段员工王玉玺、贾兴都、范群等，背着步枪一支，电话机等多件，他们立即架通太谷、东观间电线，拿出大量电池交公。工务段工具，在材料工人冉文澄认真保护下，完整无损，有的员工，把过去多年积存的器材、工具交出。七月十五日（太谷解放后第三天），开始了紧张的修路工作。他们分两个工程队出动：一路由太谷南下，一路从介休北上，向祁县汇合。开始时，员工们因长期受敌人欺骗宣传，对我不了解，再加阎匪三次“减缩”，有的留职停薪，有的职薪俱停，生活很困难，经我路局随时讲解我党职工政策，及实行每日每人麦子四斤的暂行办法，十月份起，按照各人原职原底薪开始发薪金。另以煤炭、米优待补助，工人生活有了保障，情绪极高。工务段修路架桥；电气段沿路赶架电线。机务段的司机、司炉以及车务员们，也动手扛起枕木来，木匠出身的李建立，抓紧空隙，一连赶制了六十余根镐锤锹木把，所需螺丝、道钉、夹板和工具，经过工人们搜集赶制，逐步获得解决。他们为了争取早日通车，每日早五点起床，晚十一点休息，白天冒着敌机投弹扫射，辛勤地劳作着。他们说：“阎匪在时，一天做半天的活，大都在敷衍，现在作不完活不回去。”与此同时，榆、太、祁、平、介沿线农民、妇女和儿童，在支前繁忙中，把锯好的两万根枕木和多年拆存的铁轨，送到路线来。抢修太谷、东观段时，长一百二十八公尺的昌源河桥（两孔塌入河里），估计约需千余个麻袋装土垫桥基，才能搭架扣轨，但经过工人们研究想出简捷办法，立即推来两车皮石头代替；当天还下着雨，一个个跃入深及腰间的河水里，进行抢修。此段全部工程二公里，三百米路线，两座桥梁，这工程过去最少也得七天，现在三天就完成了。当修复榆次、太谷间的象峪河桥时，两孔被破，没有垫桥基的石头，工人们即将桥旁阎匪的炮楼拆毁，五十余人一天完工。阎匪时代亦曾修过一次同样的工程，八十余工人，五十余民工，两天两夜才勉强完工。在铁路员工们的努力下十九天内即胜利修复了二十六公里被破路线和大小卅二座桥梁，争取了在八月九日榆（次）灵（石）间正式通车，开始载负军运任务。
    （二）一切为了保证军运完成
    在支援太原战役中，全线一百六十公里，员工逐渐增至一千五百三十五名，有的站没有站房，设备简陋，人数也仅及抗战前的三分之一。机车车皮多半残破，加以敌机不断破坏，但员工们并不气馁，十月份军运繁忙时，每晚上下行车十六次，沿线各站员工打破隔一天值班一次的制度，补救人力不足。运转科副科长孙松溪（兼调度所主任）和调度员郭玉成高中等，以电话彻夜亲自掌握行车调度。太原战役后勤指挥部派往该路之军运处秘书孙长春同志，每日只能休息三、四小时，以致身体消瘦，久劳致病，但仍坚持工作。司机岳顺兴于某次行车中，玻璃管突然破裂，但仍多方设法，避免事故，直达目的地。敌机突袭太谷站时，机车上正冒着浓烟，王保山奋不顾身，将火蒙蔽，掩盖了目标。该站道班为了机车安全，自动加三个夜班，突击完成防空设备。某日大雨，河水暴涨，由于工人刘买成认真守护，即修好点火，马上叫大家抢修，保证顺畅通车。工匠孙品山等二人两天内焊起被炸毁大烟管四根，过热管十根，小烟管五个，锅堵一个。在车辆不足的情况下，突击运输器材，他们采取了两种克服困难的办法：首先是和沿线后勤器材站密切联系，提高装卸技术，加多行车次数，上下行车由九月份的二百八十九次，增至十月份的五百零一次，每晚平均十六次强。灵石每个车皮由装三百余块门板，增至六百二十块，东阳每个车皮，由装四千余斤谷草，增至一万四千余斤。武宿车站恢复，站长宋正明与当地后勤单位器材站研究改进装卸工作，节省民力不少。第二个克服的办法，就是起复抢修解放时掉道已久的机车和车皮。十月四日，太谷机务段，及榆次分驻所，在鸣李分头起复“一五一零”机车和两辆车皮，当时武宿还住有敌人，不时射来炮弹，他们说：“按这种情况，过去最少得一列铁甲车掩护，还得四天才能完工”但他们现在不顾炮火和敌机袭扰，采用人力压机，提前完成了任务。领工陈玉起在上压机时被铁轨把头碰破流血不止，抬煤夫朱更堂被百五十斤重的枕木压伤脚指，他们都稍作包扎，仍坚持工作，直至完工。“一五一零”机车拉至介休后，弯曲折损缺少的零件百件以上，经过机务段领班高旦起、田联祥，工匠孙品山等二十九人六天抢修，照常行驶。
    （三）发挥创造克服一切困难
    在克服器材原料困难上，工人们想尽了一切办法：太谷水塔、锅炉堵上的石棉绳垫圈坏了，因漏水马上就要影响给水任务，这时老工人任双印细心钻研，用砖刻成模型，找废铅铸了一个铅质垫圈（他原来并不会翻砂技术），挽救了危局，他说：“过去用石棉绳每月就得换替一次，咱这一下最少能用三个月了！”介休机务段代段长刘声萱，用枣木刻制代替了机车气缸缺铅八根的困难。修理匠张秀山修改了“一五一零”机车气室内的排水门。由祁县起复拉向太谷的六个车皮，因缺乏四十个油枕和两个车皮上的轴瓦，无法行动，领班阎双务领导大家把车轴部分擦干净，减少磨擦力，用了八个油枕；另用木刻轴瓦代替铁轴瓦，保证了车皮安全拉回。机车上普遍缺油，工人们用加石灰水的乳化油来代替。又以八成麻油二成轴油配成代用品。此外，以锡代替五金铁管（加一小孔），代替玻璃管（测水器），麻绳代替石棉绳，硬干油加车轴油代替软干油，许多没有或已成废物的东西，经过工人、技师的艰苦创造，又被利用着。铁路员工普遍反映：“阎匪在时，车辆坏了，送太原工厂修理，现在咱们自己就是工厂修理所！”
    （四）打到那里开到那里
    榆次北八公里多的鸣李车站，虽受炮火威胁，但工人们仍积极坚持进行了勘测修复工作。解放武宿的第二天，通到榆次的三—华里路即行通车。某日在敌机袭扰下，一天内又增修至距太原市仅八公里余的北营车站。紧随部队的前进，打到那里修到那里，火车就开到那里。把大量粮食、蔬菜运送前方。
