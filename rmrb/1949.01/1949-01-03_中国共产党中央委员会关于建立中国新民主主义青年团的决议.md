　　Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of the China New Democratic Youth League
    (January 1, 1949)
    (1) Chinese youth have played a great and active role in the long-term struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism, especially during the Anti-Japanese War and in the struggle against American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and in the military, political, economic, and cultural construction of the Chinese liberated areas; After a long period of various struggles and the education of the Chinese Communist Party, their political consciousness has been generally improved, and a large number of advanced activists have emerged. Therefore, organizations and activities in the form of the Youth National Salvation League, the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, and the Youth Reading Club can no longer meet the requirements of these advanced youth activists; and the Party's work among the youth masses in the liberated areas is often lax due to the lack of organized and systematic promotion by advanced youth, and cannot exert its due strength. In October 1946, the Central Committee of our Party issued a proposal to establish an organization of advanced youth activists - the China New Democratic Youth League, and instructed the Central Bureaus and Sub-bureaus to conduct pilot projects in selected areas; In the past two years, youth league organizations have been established in some areas of the Northeast, East China, North China, and Northwest (including Jin-Sui) liberated areas. The results of the pilot projects of the Youth League in various regions have proved that the Youth League established in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's proposal has been loved by the broad masses of young people and adult people, and it has played a great role in leading and uniting the broad masses of young people to join the army, participate in the war, develop production, land reform, democratic construction, and cultural undertakings. Facts have proved that the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League is completely possible and necessary. Based on this need, and in order to unite and educate the entire generation of youth, and to give greater play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the youth masses in the People's Liberation War and the construction of a New Democratic country, the Central Committee has officially decided to universally establish the organization of the New Democratic Youth League in China.
    (2) The China New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth who are determined to fight for New Democracy under the political leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, is the core for the Party to unite and lead the broad masses of youth, and is a school for the Party to educate youth with Marxism-Leninism. Its task is to first unite and organize advanced youth activists, and then, through the organization of these youth activists, to unite and educate the broad masses of youth, and together with the Chinese people, to thoroughly overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, to establish the New Democratic People's Republic of China, and to fight to the end for the complete liberation of China and all mankind, and to continuously educate Chinese youth in this practical struggle. The China New Democratic Youth League should absorb all men and women youth who firmly support the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party, are willing to actively fight for the cause of New Democracy, and are willing to loyally serve the working people as members, and their age should generally be from fifteen to twenty-five years old. Precisely because it is the New Democratic Youth League, it should absorb more extensively the youth activists from all democratic strata into the League than the past Communist Youth League, in order to expand its mass character, but it is still an organization of advanced activists among the Chinese youth masses, and not an ordinary general youth organization. Only by organizing the activists among Chinese youth well can the broad masses of Chinese youth have a solid core and carry out persistent work among the national youth masses. Otherwise, the youth masses of the whole of China cannot be united well. The composition of the members should be based on the activists among young workers, young farmers, and general working youth, and revolutionary young intellectuals from other strata, and progressive and conscious young people from other strata who are willing to actively fight for New Democracy should also be absorbed to participate. League life should give full play to the democratic and mass-based lively style on the basis of democratic centralism, cultivate the enthusiasm and creativity of the members, and train their organization and discipline. Special attention should be paid to preventing the emergence of narrow closed-doorism, youth vanguardism, or sectarianism in the work and style of the Youth League. The China New Democratic Youth League accepts the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party politically, but should maintain its own independent system organizationally, and the Party has no right to directly order the Youth League. Party members in the Youth League must obey all resolutions of the Party, and consolidate the Party's leadership in the Youth League with tireless persuasive education work and their own exemplary actions.
    (3) The basic task of the New Democratic Youth League is to systematically study Marxism-Leninism, continuously educate its members and youth masses from revolutionary practice, and at the same time should organize the broad masses of youth in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to actively participate in various movements called for by our Party and the People's Democratic Government. Therefore, on the basis of serving the people and the youth, it should create various methods suitable for the characteristics of the environment and the interests of the youth, and unite and lead the broad masses of youth to realize the following tasks:
    First, the two major strategic tasks of the Chinese people at present are to strive for the complete victory of the People's Liberation War and to restore and develop the production undertakings in all liberated areas. The Youth League must take leading the youth masses to actively join the army, participate in the war, support the front, and develop agricultural and industrial production as the center of all its work.
    Second, the Youth League should, on the basis of the greatest interests of the greatest number of people, always pay attention to and strive to serve the special interests and immediate needs of the youth masses, and in this effort, gradually guide the broad masses of youth to participate in the military, political, economic, and cultural construction work of the People's Democratic country, and the international youth anti-imperialist democratic peace movement.
    Third, conduct extensive and systematic ideological education work on the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and Chinese revolutionary practice among the Youth League members and youth masses outside the League, so that they gradually learn to use the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialist viewpoint to understand the process of social development and understand the laws of Chinese revolutionary development; study cultural, scientific, production, and military knowledge; study business and skills; so that each member can continuously improve themselves ideologically, politically, culturally, and in work. All Youth League members should take the promotion of Marxist-Leninist ideas and various policies of New Democracy as their glorious responsibility. The Youth League should also help government education departments to improve school education and social education.
    Fourth, lead the work of teenagers and children, absorb children aged seven to twelve to participate in the Children's Corps, and absorb teenagers aged thirteen to seventeen to participate in the Young Pioneers; smaller rural areas can jointly form the Teenagers and Children's Corps. The Youth League should select the best cadres to lead this work, and establish a Teenagers and Children's Department or a Teenagers and Children's Committee under the Youth League Committees at all levels, as the leading organs of the Children's Corps and the Young Pioneers.
    (4) The New Democratic Youth League should be established on the basis of the voluntary and conscious will of the youth masses, and should openly carry out the establishment of the League in mass movements and various works. Therefore, regular propaganda work on the New Democratic Youth League should be carried out among the people and the youth masses, and a correct understanding of the Youth League should be established among the people and the youth masses. At the beginning of the establishment of the League, it is especially necessary to carry out in-depth propaganda and full deliberation, and then formally join the League according to personal willingness and through the League joining procedures. It is absolutely necessary to prevent the adoption of compulsory methods, casually pulling people into the League, and simply pursuing a large number of members and other wrong practices and acute diseases in the work of developing members. In the work of establishing the League, on the one hand, it is necessary to maintain the political purity of the League, and at the same time, it is also necessary to prevent narrowness, refusing some advanced youth outside the door of the League, hindering the League's contact with the broad masses. Party organizations in various places must review the existing youth work cadres, and carefully and quickly promote and transfer a group of young male and female Party member cadres who are ideologically correct and in contact with the masses, and after short-term training, enable them to correctly grasp the policy of establishing the League. The persons in charge of the Youth League Committees at all levels should be filled by cadres equivalent to members of the Party Committee at the same level and secretaries of the Party Committee at the next level. The experience of establishing the League in the past two years has proved that grasping the Central Committee's policy of establishing the League, training and equipping a sufficient number of youth work cadres are the basic conditions necessary for establishing the League.
    The steps for establishing the League should be to advance step by step with emphasis, first starting from cities, factories, schools, troops, and villages and towns with more concentrated population and a better foundation for the Party's work, and then seeking universal development. In the above-mentioned places, when there is no League organization, the Party must instruct the Party organizations in these places to set aside a part of the young and excellent Party members as members of the League, as the foundation and backbone for establishing the League. A preparatory committee for the Youth League may be established above the district level. In a factory, school, street, or rural area, if there are five members, a League branch should be established immediately. If there are more than three branches in a district, the District Committee of the League should be formally established. If there are more than three District Committees in a county or a city, the organization of the County or City Committee of the League should be formally established, so that the League's organization and work can be rapidly developed, and then convene the representative congresses of the Youth League in various places, provinces, and liberated areas to elect the leading organs of the Youth League in various places, provinces, and liberated areas. In newly liberated cities and regions, because there is no work foundation, more sufficient propaganda, deliberation, and preparation work must be carried out when establishing the League than in old and semi-old areas.
    (5) The Central Committee has decided to convene the first National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League in the summer of 1949 to formally establish the China New Democratic Youth League, formulate the Youth League's work program and charter, and elect the Central Committee of the Youth League. At present, the local Youth League should initiate the establishment of a preparatory committee for the National Youth League to prepare for the convening of the Youth League Congress. It is also proposed that around the time of the first National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, a National Youth Congress should be convened to establish a joint organization of national youth.
    In order to systematically train the cadres of the Youth League, in addition to the Central Youth Work Committee having instructed the establishment of a League school, the Central Bureaus, District Party Committees, Provincial Party Committees, Prefectural Party Committees, County Party Committees, and Municipal Party Committees should also establish League schools or training classes in their respective regions. In order to guide the work of the National Youth League and organize the broad masses of youth to study, the Central Committee has decided that the Central Youth Work Committee will be responsible for publishing a regular publication, "China Youth."
    (6) The establishment of the national and local New Democratic Youth Leagues is the central link in the current youth movement, and is one of the extremely important tasks of the Party under the victorious development of the current revolutionary situation, and the Party committees in various places must pay attention to it. After receiving this resolution, the Party Committees of the Central Bureaus, Sub-bureaus, Provincial Committees, District Party Committees, County Party Committees, and Municipal Party Committees, and the Party Committees at all levels of the People's Liberation Army (separate regulations and notices will be issued on how to establish the League in the army) should immediately convene meetings, formulate specific work plans, and effectively supervise their implementation.

　　中国共产党中央委员会关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议
    （一九四九年一月一日）
    （一）中国青年，在中国人民的长期的反对帝国主义和封建主义的斗争中，特别是在抗日期间及抗日胜利以后的反对美帝国主义与国民党反动政府的斗争中，在中国解放区的军事、政治、经济、文化各种建设中，都起了伟大的积极的作用；经过了长期的各种斗争的锻炼和中国共产党的教育，他们的政治觉悟已经普遍地提高，涌现出了大批先进的积极分子。因此，仅有青年救国会、青年抗日先锋队、青年读书会等类形式的组织与活动，已经不能满足这些先进青年积极分子的要求；而党在解放区青年群众中的工作，也因为缺少先进青年有组织有系统的推动，常常流于松懈，不能发挥应有的力量。一九四六年十月，我党中央即已发出建立先进青年积极分子的组织——中国新民主主义青年团的提议，并责成各中央局、各分局择地试办；两年以来，在东北、华东、华北、西北（包括晋绥）各解放区，都已在若干地区建立有团的组织。各地区试办青年团的结果证明：凡是根据中央提议的精神所建立起来的青年团，都受到广大青年群众与成年人民群众的爱护，它在领导和团结广大青年参军、参战、发展生产、土地改革及民主建设和文化事业中表现了极大的作用。事实证明，建立新民主主义青年团是完全可能的与必要的。根据此种需要，并为着团结教育整个青年的一代，以及更大地发挥青年群众在人民解放战争中与新民主主义国家建设中的积极性与创造性，中央正式决定在中国普遍建立新民主主义青年团的组织。
    （二）中国新民主主义青年团，是在中国共产党的政治领导之下坚决地为新民主主义而斗争的先进青年们的群众性的组织，是党去团结与领导广大青年群众的核心，是党以马克思列宁主义教育青年的学校。它的任务，就是首先要团结和组织先进青年的积极分子，再经过这种青年积极分子的组织去团结和教育广大的青年群众，和中国人民一道，为了彻底推翻帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义在中国的统治，为了建立新民主主义的中华人民民主共和国，为了全中国和全人类的彻底解放事业而奋斗到底，并在这种实践的奋斗中不断地教育中国的青年。中国新民主主义青年团应当吸收一切坚决拥护中国共产党的主张、愿为新民主主义的事业而积极奋斗，愿为劳动人民忠诚服务的男女青年为团员，其年龄一般地应为十五岁至二十五岁。正因为它是新民主主义青年团，就应该比较过去的共产主义青年团、更为广泛地吸收各民主阶层中的青年积极分子入团，以扩大自己的群众性，但是它仍然是中国青年群众中的先进积极分子的组织。而不是普通的一般的青年团体。只有很好地组织中国青年中的积极分子，才能使中国广大的青年群众有一个巩固的核心，在全国青年群众中进行坚持不懈的工作。否则，就不能很好地团结全中国的青年群众。团员成份应以青年工人、青年农民和一般劳动青年中的积极分子和其他阶层出身的革命的青年知识分子为基础，同时也应当吸收其他阶层中的进步的觉悟的愿为新民主主义而积极奋斗的青年人参加。团内生活，应在民主集中制的基础上，充分地发挥民主的与群众化的生动活泼的作风，培养团员的积极性与创造性，并训练他们的组织性与纪律性。应当特别注意防止在青年团的工作中和作风上产生狭隘的关门主义、青年先锋主义或宗派主义的倾向。中国新民主主义青年团在政治上接受中国共产党的领导，但在组织上应当保持自己的独立系统，党无权直接命令青年团。青年团内的党员，必须服从党的一切决议，并以不疲倦的说服教育工作和自己的模范行动，来巩固党在青年团中的领导。
    （三）新民主主义青年团的基本任务，在于有系统地学习马克思列宁主义，从革命实践中不断地教育自己的团员和青年群众，同时应当以马克思列宁主义的精神组织广大青年群众积极地参加我党和人民民主政府所号召的各种运动。因此，应在为人民大众与青年服务的基础上创造适合环境特点与青年兴趣的各种方法，团结和领导广大青年群众去实现下列各项工作：
    第一、当前中国人民的两大战略任务，为争取人民解放战争的彻底胜利，和恢复与发展一切解放区的生产事业。青年团必须把领导青年群众积极参军、参战、支前以及发展农业与工业生产，作为自己一切工作的中心。
    第二、青年团应在最大多数人民的最大利益的基础上，经常地注意和努力为青年群众的特殊利益与切身需要而服务，并在这种努力中逐步地引导广大青年群众去参加人民民主国家的军事的政治的经济的文化的各种建设工作，和国际青年的反帝国主义的民主和平运动。
    第三、在青年团团员与团外青年群众中，广泛地有系统地进行马克思列宁主义的理论和中国革命实践之统一的思想教育工作，使他们逐步地学会使用马列主义的辩证唯物观点，去认识社会发展过程，认识中国革命发展的规律；学习文化、科学、生产与军事知识；学习业务与技能；使每个团员在思想上、政治上、文化上与工作上、不断地提高自己。一切青年团员应该把宣传马列主义思想和新民主主义的各种政策作为自己的光荣责任。青年团并应帮助政府教育机关，去改进学校教育与社会教育。
    第四、领导少年与儿童工作，吸收七岁到十二岁的儿童参加儿童团，吸收十三岁到十七岁的少年参加少年先锋队，较小的农村则合组为少年儿童团。青年团应选派最好的干部领导这一工作，并在各级团委之下设立少年儿童部，或少年儿童委员会，作为儿童团和少年先锋队的领导机关。
    （四）新民主主义青年团要建立在青年群众的自愿的和自觉的基础之上，要在群众运动与各种工作中公开地进行建团。因此，应在人民群众和青年群众中进行经常的关于新民主主义青年团的宣传工作，在人民群众和青年群众中树立对于青年团的正确的认识。在开始建团时，尤须深入宣传与充分酝酿，然后根据本人自愿，经过入团手续正式入团。应当绝对防止在发展团员的工作中采用强迫办法、随便拉人入团的办法和简单地追求团员人数众多等项错误的作法与急性病。在建团工作中，一方面必须保持团在政治上的纯洁性，同时也要防止狭隘性，将一些先进青年拒绝于团的大门之外，妨碍团与广大群众的联系。各地党的组织必须将现有青年工作干部加以审查，并慎重与迅速地提拔、抽调一批思想正确、联系群众的青年男女党员干部，经过短期训练，使他们能够正确地掌握建团的方针。各级团委负责人应由相当于同级党委委员与下一级党委书记的干部充任。两年来建团的经验证明，掌握中央建团方针，训练和配备足够数量的青年工作干部，乃是建团所必须的基本条件。
    建团的步骤，应当是有重点地逐步地向前推进，首先从城市、工厂、学校、部队及人口较集中、党的工作基础较好的村镇开始，然后再求普遍的发展。在上述地方，尚无团的组织时，党必须责成这些地方党的组织，划出一部分年青而优秀的党员兼为团员，作为建团的基础与骨干。区以上得设青年团筹备委员会。在一个工厂、学校、街道或农村中，有五个团员，应即成立团的支部，一个区内有三个支部以上，即应正式成立团的区委，一县或一市，有三个区委以上，即应正式成立团的县或市委的组织，使团的组织与工作能迅速地得到发展，然后召集各地方各省及各解放区的青年团的代表大会，选举各地方各省及各解放区青年团的领导机关。新解放的城市与地区，因无工作基础，建团时则须较老区半老区有更充分的宣传酝酿与准备工作。
    （五）中央决定在一九四九年夏季召开中国新民主主义青年团的第一次全国代表大会，正式成立中国新民主主义青年团，制定青年团的工作纲领、团章、并选举青年团的中央委员会。目前应即由地方青年团发起建立全国青年团的筹备委员会，筹备青年团代表大会的召集。并提议于中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会前后，召开全国青年代表大会，成立全国青年的联合组织。
    为了有计划地训练青年团的干部，除中央已经责成中央青年工作委员会举办团校外，各中央局、区党委、省委、地委、县委和市委并应在各该地区举办团的学校或训练班。为了指导全国青年团的工作和组织广大青年学习，中央决定由中央青年工作委员会负责出版“中国青年”的定期刊物。
    （六）建立全国性的和各地方的新民主主义青年团，是当前青年运动的中心环节，是党在目前革命形势胜利发展下的极重要的工作之一，各地党委必须予以重视。各中央局、分局、省委、区党委、县委和市委，人民解放军的各级党委（关于在军队中如何建团另行规定通告）接到此项决议以后，应即召开会议，定出具体工作计划，并切实督促执行。
