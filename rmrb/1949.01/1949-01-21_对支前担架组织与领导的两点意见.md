　　Two Suggestions Regarding the Organization and Leadership of Frontline Stretcher Teams
　　People's Armed Forces Department of North China Military Region, Chen Haowen
　　In the past, due to the lack of unified regulations for logistical support work in our region, the organization and allocation of stretchers varied greatly from place to place, and the number of people per stretcher also differed. In the Yizhong and Beiyue areas, after several reorganizations, the number of people per stretcher was reduced from seven to five. This time, Jizhong is also considering reducing it to four people per stretcher, but the company maintains a mobile force of five to seven people to replace stretcher bearers in case of temporary illness, so that the number of stretchers is not reduced. This streamlining is good, but concentrating five to seven people in the company puts pressure on the lower levels and concentrates some problems in the company, which is not as good as assigning them to platoons to strengthen grassroots leadership. In the Jinnan area, the number of stretcher bearers was as high as nine or as low as seven in the past. It is not known whether there have been any new changes now. If preparations are made according to the original organization, there will be a great disparity with the organizations in Jizhong and Beiyue. In order to complete the frontline support tasks and save manpower, and for unified leadership, I propose the following two suggestions for reference:
　　I. Organizational Leadership of Long-Term Frontline Support Stretcher Teams: (1) Administrative Organization: A. The sub-district organizes a civilian labor department, with one director and one political commissar, four organization and propaganda officers (one responsible for communications and reporting), two supply personnel, one clerk for document reception and dispatch, six messengers, and two cooks; if there are pack mules and horses, two mule drivers can be added, totaling nineteen people; the political commissar, depending on the conditions, participates in the troop logistics, serving as deputy director or militia section chief. B. The county establishes a regimental headquarters, with one regimental commander and one political commissar, two organization and propaganda officers, two supply officers, one quartermaster, one cook, four messengers, and two doctors; if there are pack mules, one mule driver is assigned, totaling fifteen people. C. The company organization consists of four people per stretcher, three stretchers per squad, with one squad leader and one deputy squad leader, totaling fourteen people (the squad leader and deputy squad leader, in addition to daily leadership work, still take turns with other team members); three squads form a platoon, with one platoon leader, totaling forty-three people; three platoons form a company, with one company commander, one political instructor, one cultural instructor, one traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, two messengers, one quartermaster, three sergeants, and nine cooks (the cooks are led by the quartermaster). D. Company-level cadres—the company commander, political instructor, and quartermaster must be cadres who are detached from production; the platoon leader is to be an area (i.e., squadron) cadre or a better village cadre. (2) Party Organization: According to local experience, the cadres who lead the stretcher bearers are temporarily drawn from various departments; some did not have a direct leadership relationship in the past. If there is no Party organization, it will be difficult to solve problems. According to the experience of Jinzhong, establishing the Party on the front line and identifying cadres on the front line have been successful. Regarding organization, generally, a Party committee is established in the sub-district, a general branch in the regiment, a branch in the company, and a group in the squad or platoon. (3) Establishment of a Civilian Labor Committee: In order to promote democracy and the enthusiasm of the civilian laborers, a civilian labor committee should be established in the company (it can be omitted above the company level). It is elected democratically by the civilian laborers. The members of the civilian labor committee can be responsible for organizing the Economic Committee, Cultural and Entertainment Committee, etc. The committee consists of five to seven people, divided into director, organization, propaganda, civil affairs, health, economy, entertainment, etc., and should generally be increased or decreased and assigned according to the company's situation. After the above organization is established, a system should be established, which is discussed and adopted by everyone, and each squad can formulate an action plan according to the system. According to past experience, the better the system is adhered to, the greater the role the organization plays; if the system is not adhered to well, the organization is just a formality. Therefore, the person in charge should check and summarize the work regularly.
　　II. Material Preparations: (1) Company: Each company must bring one marching pot, two oil carriers, one kitchen knife, one spoon, one razor, and one small flag (not red) for contact signals. (2) Each squad should bring hammers, needles, rice cloths, marching water bottles (each stretcher must have one), small picks, shovels, etc. In addition to clothing and bedding, each person should bring a small rice bowl, a rice bag, and camouflage cloth or disguises. The shoes should have straps.
　　The above is still very incomplete. If there are things that were brought on previous expeditions that are not mentioned, they should be brought as completely as possible. Especially in the severe cold of the northern climate, it is even more necessary to prevent sudden weather changes or heavy snow, and to have sufficient preparations in clothing and luggage.

### 对支前担架组织与领导的两点意见

　　对支前担架组织与领导的两点意见
    华北军区人民武装部  陈好问
    我区过去由于勤务工作没有统一规定，在担架的组织配备上各地极不一致，每付担架人数多少也不一样，在翼中和北岳两地区，经过数次整顿，每付担架由七人减少到五人；这次冀中又研究减少到每付四个人，但连部保持五至七人的机动人数，以防有临时病号时替换，不使担架减少。这种精简是好的，不过五至七人集中在连部，这样上宽下紧，有些问题都集中在连部，就不如配备到班，加强下层领导。冀南的担架组织，过去每付多者九人，少者七人，现在有无新的变更不详。如按原组织准备，那就与冀中、北岳的组织悬殊很大。为了完成支前任务及节省民力，领导统一，我提出以下两点意见供参考：
    一、长期支前担架的组织领导：（一）行政组织：甲、分区组织民工部，设部长、政委各一人，组宣干事四人（一人负责通讯报导），供给人员二人，文书收发一人，通信员六人，伙夫二人；如有驮骡马匹，可添马夫二人，共十九人；政委根据条件，参加部队后勤，担任副主任或民兵科长。乙、县建立团部，设团长、政委各一人，组宣干事二人，供给员二人，司务长一人，伙夫一人，通信员四人，医生二人，如有驮骡，设骡夫一人，共十五人。丙、连队组织，每四人一付担架，三付为一班，设正副班长各一人，共十四人（正副班长除日常领导工作外，仍与其他队员一样接替）；每三班为一排，设排长一人，共四十三人；每三排为一连，设连长一人，指导员一人，文化教员一人，中医一人，通信员二人，司务长一人，上士三人，伙夫九人（伙夫由司务长任班长）。丁、连队干部——连长、指导员、司务长，必须是脱离生产的干部；排长由小区（即中队）干部担任，或较好的村干部担任。（二）党的组织：根据各地经验，带领担架民工，均系各个部门抽的干部临时组成；有的过去不是直接领导关系，如没有党的组织，发生问题则不好解决。根据晋中的经验，在火线上建党和火线上鉴定干部，都是成功的。关于组织，一般的分区成立党委会，团设总支，连设支部，以班或排设小组。（三）建立民工委员会：为了发扬民主与民工的积极性，连队建立民工委员会（连以上可不设）。由民工民主选举产生。民工委员会的委员可负责组织经委会、文化娱乐委员会等。该会由五人至七人组成，分主任、组织、宣传、民运、卫生、经济、娱乐等，一般应根据连队情况增减和分工。以上组织建立之后，应规定制度，制度是大家讨论通过，各班可根据制度订出行动计划。根据以往经验，制度坚持的好，组织发挥作用就大；制度坚持不好，组织就是形式。因此，负责人要按期检查和总结工作。
    二、物质准备：（一）连队：每连须带行军锅一口，油担子两付，菜刀一把，勺子一个，剃头刀一把，小旗一个（不要红色）为联络信号。（二）每班要带锤子、针、打饭布、行军水壶（每付担架要有一把）、小洋镐、锹等。每个人除衣被外，要带小饭碗，米袋子，防空布或伪装物。鞋上要有带子。
    以上所提还很不完整，以往出征所带的东西，如有没提到的，还要尽量带齐全，特别是北方气候严寒，更要防止天气突变或下大雪，在衣被行装上要有足够准备。
