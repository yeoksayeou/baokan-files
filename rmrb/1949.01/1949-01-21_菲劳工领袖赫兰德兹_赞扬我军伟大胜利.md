　　Philippine Labor Leader Hernandez
　　Praises Our Army's Great Victory

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: New York dispatch: Amado Hernandez, President of the Philippine Labor Union and one of the leaders of the People's Resistance Army, who is currently traveling in the United States and Europe to investigate labor conditions, told reporters in New York on December 28 that the Philippine people's resistance movement against the American puppet government has been greatly encouraged by the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He expressed delight at the new turning point in the Chinese People's Liberation War towards national victory. He said that the Chinese Communist Party is the representative of the Chinese workers and peasants, and also the true representative of the Chinese people. Hernandez denounced the United States for maintaining land, sea, and air bases in the Philippines. He said: We do not believe in war; we believe that we will not have true freedom until the more than twenty American war bases with extraterritorial rights are removed from our territory. He also said that the independence granted to the Philippines by the United States in July 1946 is seen by the people as nothing more than a joke. The current Philippine government, which is as obedient as a slave to the orders of Wall Street economic tycoons and American soldiers, is doing its best to help the United States tighten its grip on our country. The Quirino puppet government is just a rubber stamp of the American government.

　　菲劳工领袖赫兰德兹
  　赞扬我军伟大胜利
    【新华社陕北七日电】纽约讯：刻正游历美欧考察劳工状况的菲律滨劳工联合会主席及民抗军领袖之一的阿玛多·赫兰德兹，十二月二十八日在纽约招待记者时称：菲律滨人民反对美国傀儡政府的抵抗运动，正因中国人民解放军的胜利而得到很大的鼓舞。他对中国人民解放战争走向全国胜利的新转折点，表示欣快。他说：中国共产党是中国工人和农民的代表，也是中国人民真正的代表。赫民痛斥美国在菲律滨保持陆海空军基地。他说：我们不相信战争；我们认为，在附有治外法权的二十余处美国战争基地从我国领土上去掉之前，我们不会有真正的自由。他又说：美国于一九四六年七月允予菲律滨的独立，在人民看来只是一种笑话。对华尔街经济大王与美国军人的命令驯服如奴的菲律滨现政府，正尽力帮助美国加紧束缚我国。季里诺傀儡政府，就是美国政府的橡皮图章而已。
