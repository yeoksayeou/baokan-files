　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. TASS dispatch: Pravda published on December 27th a commentary by its reporter Yuri Zhukov on the Security Council's discussion of the Indonesian question. Zhukov pointed out: The Security Council's three-day discussion showed that the US representative's request for the Security Council to convene an emergency meeting was absolutely not to stop the aggression and help protect the Republic of Indonesia, but for the completely opposite purpose. The charade performed by some people is only aimed at confusing the minds of ordinary American citizens and deceiving world public opinion, concealing the true cause of the Dutch aggression. Zhukov emphasized that it would be foolish and ignorant to think that the Dutch government would dare to restart armed aggression without the connivance of the United States. The United States has already locked the hands and feet of the Netherlands with the golden chains of the "Marshall Plan" and the iron chains of the "Western Group" (now transformed into the "North Atlantic Alliance"). There are various reasons to infer that the Dutch army's trampling on those who do not want to be bound by foreign forces is precisely paving the way for larger-scale intrusion of American capital into Asia. Zhukov pointed out: The US's attempt in Indonesia is to repeat what American expansionists have done in the Philippines. The democratic forces in both places have been cruelly suppressed. In both places, the United States has pushed to the stage those who are to the taste of colonial imperialists. Zhukov finally stated: "The Dutch aggressors unexpectedly and easily occupied the capital of the Republic, Yogyakarta, which makes one suspect whether such a thing would have happened without the betrayal within the Indonesian government camp. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that Hatta had held intimate talks with the Dutch Foreign Minister in early December, and after returning to Yogyakarta on December 13, he passed a letter from the US representative to the head of the Dutch delegation. In that letter, Hatta practically completely surrendered to the Dutch government. The Dutch representative attending the Security Council frankly admitted that Hatta's letter was written under the pressure of Cochran, the American representative of the Mediation Committee."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS Moscow dispatch: Pravda published on the 26th Viktorov's commentary on the Security Council's handling of the Indonesian question. Viktorov, recalling that the Soviet representative's proposals to stop Dutch aggression had been repeatedly rejected at past Security Council meetings, emphasized that certain countries, primarily the United States, Britain, and France, had adopted a policy of condoning Dutch aggression. It is well known that the United States, on the one hand, participated in the "Mediation Committee," "mediating" the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia; on the other hand, it intensified its supply of military equipment to the Netherlands. These armaments are urgently needed by the Dutch aggressors. The United States has spared no effort to split Indonesia's national liberation movement, while also undermining it from within by supporting the traitorous and reactionary elements of the Indonesian national bourgeoisie. It is not at all surprising that Dutch imperialists have seen in all these facts the United States' encouragement of their colonial policy. The current discussion of the Indonesian question in the Security Council shows that Dutch imperialists are acting with the certainty that the United States and Britain will continue to pursue a policy of indulgence. As a result of the efforts of the US-British bloc, the Security Council passed a resolution that ignored the essence of the issue, actually demanding a ceasefire from "both sides." But everyone knows that the problem is a unilateral act of aggression, and this aggression was committed by the Netherlands. The resolution did not even include a condemnation of the aggression. In addition, the resolution suggested preserving the US, Belgian, and Australian "Mediation Committee," whose activities to this day have not only not reduced but have intensified the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia. It is quite obvious that this resolution cannot satisfy the democrats of all countries.

### 苏联真理报著文抨击　美帝纵荷侵略印尼　图利用安理会蒙骗世界舆论

　　苏联真理报著文抨击 　 美帝纵荷侵略印尼
  　图利用安理会蒙骗世界舆论
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社讯：真理报于十二月二十七日发表该报名记者尤里·朱可夫对安理会讨论印尼问题的评论。朱可夫指出：安理会三天的讨论表明：美国代表之要求安理会召开紧急会议，绝不是为了制止侵略及帮助保护印尼共和国，而是为了完全相反的目的。某些人们表演的哑剧，其目的仅在于混乱一般美国公民的头脑及蒙骗世界舆论，掩盖荷方侵略的真正起因。朱可夫强调指出：如果认为荷政府没有美国的纵容就敢于重启武装侵略，那就是愚蠢与无知。美国已经以“马歇尔计划”的金炼及“西方集团”（现在变为“北大西洋联盟”）的铁炼锁住了荷兰的手和脚。有种种根据可以推断：荷军蹂躏那些不愿受外国束缚的人们，正是为美国资本更大规模的侵入亚洲铺平道路。朱可夫指出：美国在印尼的企图，系重复美国扩张主义者前此在菲律宾所做的。两地的民主力量，皆受到残酷的压制。美国在两地都将那些合乎殖民帝国主义者口味的人们推上台去。朱可夫最后称：“荷兰侵略者出人意料的轻易地占领共和国首都日惹，使人不得不怀疑假若没有印尼政府阵营内部的叛卖，这样的事情会不会发生。在这方面，值得提出的是，哈达曾于十二月初与荷外长进行过亲密的会谈，他于十二月十三日返回日惹后，曾经过美国代表致函荷兰代表团团长。哈达在该函中，实际上完全投降了荷兰政府。荷兰出席安理会的代表曾坦率承认哈达的那封信，是在调处委员会美国代表柯克伦的压力之下写的。”
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于二十六日发表维克托洛夫对安理会处理印尼问题的评论。维克托洛夫于回忆在过去的安理会上，苏代表关于制止荷兰侵略行动的建议屡被否决时，强调指出：某些国家，首先是美、英、法曾采取了纵容荷兰侵略的政策。众所周知：美国一方面参加“调处委员会”，“调解”荷兰与印尼之间的纠纷；另一方面又加紧以军备供给荷兰。这些军备是荷兰侵略者所急于要用的。美国曾不遗余力地分裂印尼的民族解放运动，同时并以支持印尼民族资产阶级的卖国反动分子来从内部搞垮它。荷帝国主义者已从所有这些事实里看到美国对他们殖民政策的鼓励，是毫不足奇了。目前安理会对印尼问题的讨论显示：荷兰帝国主义者是在确信美英将继续行使纵容政策之下而行动的。作为美英集团努力的结果，安理会通过了忽视问题本质的决议，竟而要求“双方”停战。但大家知道，问题是片面的侵略行为，而这种侵略乃是荷兰所犯的。该项决议甚至没有包括对侵略的谴责。此外，该决议建议保存美、比、澳“调处委员会”，而该委员会的活动至今不但没有减少而是加紧了荷兰与印尼间的冲突。十分明显，这种决议不能使一切国家的民主人士满意。
