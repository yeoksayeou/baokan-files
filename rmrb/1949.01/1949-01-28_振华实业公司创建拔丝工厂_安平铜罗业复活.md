　　Zhenhua Industrial Company Creates Wire Drawing Factory
　　Anping Copper Gauze Industry Revived
　　[Ji Zhong News] Anping County has historically been a major production area for copper gauze and horsehair gauze in the country, and this industry is a major sideline and source of income for the people of Anping. Before the War of Resistance, according to incomplete statistics, there were more than 1,500 copper gauze looms in the county. The products were sold well in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. After the War of Resistance, due to the destruction by the enemy and puppet regimes, all were destroyed and production ceased. After the Japanese surrender, a certain agency in North China established the Gongji Copper Gauze Factory in Wanghulin Village, Anping (now taken over by Zhenhua Industrial Company and renamed Zhenhua Copper Gauze Factory) to revive the Anping copper gauze industry. However, because raw materials were entirely imported from the enemy-occupied areas, procurement was very difficult and prices were high, the recovery of the copper gauze industry was greatly limited. Until last autumn, there were only fifty or sixty copper gauze looms in the entire county.
　　In order to solve this difficulty, Zhenhua Industrial Company specially established a wire drawing factory in Wanghulin Village, Anping, which is an innovation. Originally, China's wire drawing industry was not very developed (only a dozen or so in Tianjin and Beijing, and still none in Shanghai and Guangzhou), and the difficulties were particularly great because it was located in a rural area. Human resources, machinery, tools, and technical conditions were not available. However, after more than a year of exploration and preparation, with the drafting and installation by the famous technician Ma Zhenbang, and the help and joint research of the Anping Party, government, business, and industry circles, especially Zhao Qingfu, a technician from the Anping County Promotion Society Iron Factory, and all the workers, the factory officially started production and delivery recently. The factory currently has five wire drawing machines, drawing from two materials (No. 20 to No. 31) directly to three materials (No. 32 to No. 43). The product has soft silk quality, bright yellow and white color, and is very fine. According to experienced people in the copper gauze industry, it is even better than the products from the enemy-occupied areas. If the factory's products are used to weave No. 120 copper gauze, the cost can be reduced by at least half a catty to one catty of copper wire. Because the establishment of the factory will bring good fortune to the people of Anping, people travel dozens of miles to visit every day. Holding the copper wire produced by the factory, they say with confidence: "Look! This is produced by our factory, so we don't need enemy goods anymore!" "Let's go back and clean up our machines!"
　　In order to promote and develop the copper gauze sideline of the people of Anping, it is heard that the factory has recently made the following decisions: (1) Because it is newly established, the performance of various machines and the technical and production processes have not been fully mastered, and the current output has not reached the general level. Therefore, in addition to trying to research and increase output and continue to improve quality, it has been decided that before the output reaches the general level, all the copper wire produced by the factory will be supplied to the people, and the copper gauze factory attached to the factory will not use it for the time being. (2) After the output reaches the general level, research will be conducted to add copper smelting and head material drawing (from No. 0 to No. 20) and expand the two- and three-material wire drawing machines. (3) The current wire drawing machine's wire winding discs are larger, and the cyclones of general copper gauze factories and household copper gauze looms cannot be used, increasing the difficulty of rewinding. Therefore, it has been decided to replace the wire winding discs to facilitate the development of private and household copper gauze industries.

　　振华实业公司创建拔丝工厂
  　安平铜罗业复活
    【冀中讯】安平县素为全国铜罗与马尾罗重要产地，该业是安平人民主要副业与收入。抗战以前，据不完全统计，该县约有铜罗织机一千五百张以上。产品畅销冀鲁豫陕晋甘鄂皖江浙一带。抗战以后，由于敌伪摧残，全部破坏与停工。日寇投降后，我华北某机关为恢复安平铜罗业，首先在安平王胡林村创办公记铜罗工厂（现由振华实业公司接办，改名振华铜罗工厂），使铜罗业又渐趋新生。但因原料全由敌区输入，采购十分困难，并价钱昂贵，因之铜罗业之恢复受到极大制限。直到去秋，全县铜罗织机也不过五六十张。
    为了解决这一困难，振华实业公司特在安平王胡林村创办拔丝工厂，这是一个创举。本来中国拔丝业即不甚发展（全国只平津十余家至今沪、广尚无），又加处在农村，困难就特别多，人力、机器、工具与技术条件都不具备。但经一年多的摸索筹备，经著名技师马振邦之绘图、按装，及安平党政民工商各界特别是安平县推进社铁工厂技师赵庆富与全体工人之帮助与共同研究，卒于最近正式开工出货。该厂现有拔丝机五台，由二料（二○号到三一号）拔起直拔至三料（由三二号到四三号）止，产品丝质柔软，颜色光黄白亮，而且很细。据铜罗界有经验人士评论，较之敌区产品有过之无不及，如用该厂出品织一二○号之铜罗，至少可以减低成本半斤到一斤铜丝。因为该厂的建立将给安平人民带来福音，所以，跑数十里前往参观的，每日络绎不绝。拿着该厂出的铜丝，充满了自信的说：“看！这是咱们工厂出的，以后可不用敌货了！”“回去把咱们的机子也收拾起来！”
    为了带动与发展安平人民之铜罗副业，闻该厂近作了决定：（一）因系初创，对各种机器性能及技术与生产过程尚未完全掌握，目前产量尚未达到一般水准，因此除设法研究与提高产量，继续改进质量外，决定在产量未达一般水平之前，该厂所出之铜丝全部供给人民，该厂附设之铜罗工厂暂不使用。（二）在产量达一般水准之后，即研究增设溶铜与拔头料（由○号到二○号）及扩大二、三料拔丝机。（三）现有拔丝机之卷丝盘较大，而一般铜罗工厂与家庭铜罗织机之旋风不能适用，增加倒轴困难，因此决定另换卷丝盘，以利民营与家庭铜罗工业之发展。
