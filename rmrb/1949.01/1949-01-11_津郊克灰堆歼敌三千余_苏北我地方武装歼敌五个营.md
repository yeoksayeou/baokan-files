Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 9th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army, in a 50-minute battle, captured the outer Tianjin stronghold of Kehuidui, annihilating all of the defending enemy, numbering over 3,500. The People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the defenders of Kehuidui, the First Detachment of Southern Tianjin (formerly the puppet Hebei Security 10th Regiment and 34th Regiment, reorganized from the former puppet Eastern Hebei Detachment) at 9:00 AM on the 5th. After a 50-minute battle, the entire enemy force was annihilated. Preliminary battle statistics show that over 3,000 enemy soldiers were captured alive, and over 430 were killed or wounded. The following materials were seized: 26 60mm mortars, 12 grenade launchers, 5 heavy machine guns, 102 light machine guns, 19 submachine guns, 6 automatic rifles, 1,560 rifles and carbines, 72 short guns, a radio station, and over 40,000 rounds of various types of ammunition. After the battle concluded, at 5:00 PM, the enemy in Tianjin indiscriminately shelled the paper mill in the area, causing it to catch fire. Our troops quickly extinguished the fire.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: On New Year's Day at noon, local troops of the Northern Jiangsu Liberation Army annihilated five battalions of the Kuomintang bandit army's 230th Division direct unit and parts of its 688th and 689th Regiments between Taixing and Huangqiao on the north bank of the Yangtze River, capturing the deputy division commander, Su Guijing, alive. Detailed battle results are still being tallied. This bandit force departed from Taixing City on the 31st of last month, attempting to relieve the 690th Regiment of the same division, which was surrounded by the Liberation Army in Huangqiao, but was annihilated as soon as it left the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 9th: Under the overwhelming power of the Huaihai Victory, over a thousand remnants of bandits in various parts of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu have surrendered their weapons to local democratic governments. Gu Nikun, the puppet reserve battalion commander of Shangqiu, led over 200 men and weapons, and Zheng Xiangzhen and Li Qingxian, the puppet town chiefs of Mao Goudai and Yanji in the same county, led over 100 men and weapons, all surrendering to the democratic county government of Shanglu County (a newly established county between Shangqiu and Luyi). More than 130 enemy and puppet personnel and weapons have also surrendered in Xuchang, Yaochuan, Changge and other places. In Runan County, from December 3rd to 8th alone, 125 scattered bandits surrendered in just six days. In Weishi, 134 scattered bandits surrendered in half a month, handing over eight machine guns. Since the liberation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng and before the end of November, more than 5,000 puppet security teams from Xiayi, Minquan, Lanfeng, Changge, Zhongmou, and Weishi, among other places in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, have surrendered.
