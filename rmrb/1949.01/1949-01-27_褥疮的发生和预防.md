　　The Occurrence and Prevention of Bedsores
    Dong Daozhen
    The cause of bedsores: A part of the cells and tissues is subjected to pressure for a long time, stopping the blood circulation and nutrient supply to that part, resulting in tissue necrosis.
    Patients who are bedridden for a long time, are thin, and suffer from malnutrition are most likely to develop bedsores because they cannot move on their own, a large amount of subcutaneous fat disappears, and the heart and blood circulation are extremely weakened.
    Common sites for bedsores: The sacrum, back, waist, scapula, and sometimes, depending on the patient's lying position, the greater trochanter and the outside of the knee joint.
    The prevention of bedsores is easy to imagine based on the above situation: It mainly relies on our nursing staff to help patients move. The specific methods are as follows:
    (1) Use two ropes to hang down from the head of the patient's bed, tie a horizontal bar on them, but it must be able to allow the patient to raise their hands to grab it, and let the patient perform several movements to change position every day. This can save the nursing staff's work, and the patient will not suffer.
    (2) The pressed areas of the patient must be scrubbed with a hot water-soaked towel two or three times a day to prevent the blood circulation of the pressed area from stopping.
    (3) Use a soft anti-decubitus cushion with a hole in the middle to pad all the stressed areas. This must be changed frequently, otherwise the soft anti-decubitus cushion will be pressed into a hard solid object after a long time and will not work. This will cause the scope of the bedsore to be even larger.

　　褥疮的发生和预防
    董道镇
    褥疮发生的原因：是一部分细胞组织长时间受压迫，使该部的血液循环营养供给停止，致使组织坏死而形成的。
    长期卧床，身体消瘦，营养不良的患者最容易发生褥疮，因为他自己不能够运动，皮下脂肪大量消失，心脏和血液循环也极度衰弱的缘故。
    褥疮常发生的部位：尾荐部，背部，腰部，肩胛部，有时因为病人的卧位不同，也有发生在大转子和膝关节外侧的。
    褥疮的预防，根据以上的情形是很容易想到的：主要的靠我们护理工作同志，帮助患者运动，具体的办法如下：
    （一）用两根绳子从患者的床头高处吊下来，缚上一根横棍，但必须能使病人举起手来抓得着，让病人每天进行几次移动体位的运动，这样既可以节省护理工作人员的事务，患者也不受痛苦。
    （二）必须每天用热水浸手巾向病人的被压处擦洗二、三次，使被压部的血液循环不致停止。
    （三）用中间留孔的柔软褥疮垫子将所有受压的部位垫起来，这必须经常调换，不然柔软的褥疮垫，时间长久不换，会被压为硬固的东西就不起作用了。这会造成褥疮的范围更大。
