Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st -- The autumn grain collection work in the Northeast and East China liberated areas is about to be completed. Encouraged by the great victories of the People's Liberation War, peasants in the two major liberated areas are extremely enthusiastic about delivering public grain. The autumn grain collection task in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, was completed at the end of last month, one month ahead of schedule. After the start of the autumn grain collection, peasants in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Nenjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces also organized large-scale transportation teams, sending grain to warehouses in an endless stream. Grain administration organs in various provinces of Northeast China are now striving to complete the grain collection task by the end of January this year. This time, peasants in Northeast China are not only transporting public grain quickly, but also generally cleaning and drying the public grain in advance in villages and carefully selecting it before delivering it to the warehouse. Therefore, the quality of the public grain is also better than before. The achievements mentioned above are mainly due to the strong leadership of the Party committees and governments in Northeast China over this grain collection work, in addition to the peasants' spontaneous enthusiasm for delivering grain to support the front lines, encouraged by the victories of the People's Liberation War. After the Northeast Administrative Committee issued the grain collection order, various localities convened grain collection meetings to prepare everything and widely publicized the public grain policy to the peasants to carry out political mobilization. Grain administration organs in various localities quickly completed all preparations for receiving grain into warehouses in advance to receive grain at any time and facilitate the peasants. However, in individual areas, there were also deviations from the grain collection policy. For example, in some counties of Heilongjiang Province, grain was collected not according to the usual yield per mu, but according to the actual yield of last year, or it was distributed equally. In other places, the inspection of public grain was ignored, and substandard public grain was accepted casually. As a result, the warehouse refused to accept it, wasting manpower and material resources.

In the East China region, the grain collection work in Shandong Province will soon be completed. The Jiaodong Administrative Office area started collecting grain in mid-November last year and has now completed it all. In the Bohai Administrative Office area, grain collection work has been completed in most areas. The Luzhongnan Administrative Office area, due to the urgent war tasks, had pre-collected a portion of the public grain before the end of September last year, and the remaining portion is now being actively collected. In order to take care of peasants in areas affected by floods and insect plagues, the Shandong Provincial Government implemented a reduction and exemption policy during the autumn grain collection. The principle of reduction and exemption is "taking into account both military and civilian needs," that is, taking care of the needs of the war while also considering the ability of peasants to bear the burden. This fair and reasonable reduction and exemption policy of the democratic government has been warmly supported by peasants in disaster areas. During the summer grain collection in Shandong last year, many cadres adopted simple and coercive methods in their work, which aroused dissatisfaction among the peasants. This autumn grain collection, based on the experience of the summer grain collection, first carried out in-depth political mobilization among the peasant masses, explaining the significance of the autumn grain collection and enlightening their awareness, thereby creating a mass grain delivery movement, which made the grain collection work in Shandong proceed smoothly. The work style of many cadres has also been transformed in the autumn grain collection.

In addition, peasants in Lianshui, Suqian, Donghai, Huaiyin, Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, Dongtai, and other counties in northern Jiangsu Province are also vying to deliver public grain and support the People's Liberation War amid the frequent victories reported from the Huaihai Front.

### 东北华东各地农民踊跃缴纳公粮支前

　　东北华东各地农民踊跃缴纳公粮支前
    【新华社陕北一日电】东北、华东解放区的秋征工作即将全部完成。两大解放区的农民，在人民解放战争伟大的胜利鼓舞下，缴纳公粮极为踊跃。东北地区松江省的秋征任务，已于上月底全部完成，比预定计划提前了一个月。辽宁、合江、嫩江、吉林、辽宁等省的农民，在秋征开始后，也纷纷组织大车运输队，络绎送粮入仓。东北各省的粮政机关，现正争取在今年一月底前全部完成征粮任务。这次东北各地农民缴纳公粮，不但运送得快，而且一般村屯事先都把公粮簸净、晒干，细心选择，然后缴送入仓，故公粮的质量也比以前好。上述这些成绩的取得，除了农民在人民解放战争的胜利鼓舞下，自发地激起缴粮支援前线的热情外，主要是由于东北各地党委、政府对于这次征粮工作抓紧领导所致。当东北行政委员会颁布征粮命令后，各地即分别召开征粮会议，准备一切；并向农民广泛宣传公粮政策，进行政治动员。各地粮政机关，迅速将一切收粮入仓的准备工作提早完成，随时收粮，便利农民。但在个别地区，也曾发生违反征粮政策的偏向。如黑龙江省有些县份，征粮不按照地亩的通常产量，而按照去年的实际产量征收，或者平均摊派。另有一些地方，则忽视公粮的检查工作，随便收进不合标准的公粮。结果，仓库拒绝收受，浪费了人力物力。
    华东地区山东省的征粮工作，不久便可全部完成。胶东行署区自去年十一月中旬开始征粮后，现在已全部完成。渤海行署区的征粮工作，大部分地区已征收完毕。鲁中南行署区，则因战争任务紧迫，在去年九月底以前即已预征一部公粮，其余一部现正积极征收中。山东省政府为了照顾因水灾、虫灾而歉收地区的农民，在秋征中执行了减免政策。减免的原则是“军民兼顾”，即既要照顾战争需要，又要照顾农民的负担能力。民主政府这种公平合理的减免政策，受到灾区农民的热烈拥护。山东去年夏征时，不少干部曾在工作中采取简单的、强迫命令的工作方式，因而引起农民的不满。这次秋征则在总结夏征经验的基础上，先向农民群众进行深入的政治动员，解释秋征意义启发他们的觉悟，由此造成了群众性的缴粮运动，使山东的征粮工作顺利开展。不少干部的工作作风，也在秋征中得到了改造。
    此外，如苏北地区的涟水、宿迁、东海、淮阴、南通、如皋、泰兴、东台等县农民，也在淮海前线捷报频传中，争先缴纳公粮，支援人民解放战争。
