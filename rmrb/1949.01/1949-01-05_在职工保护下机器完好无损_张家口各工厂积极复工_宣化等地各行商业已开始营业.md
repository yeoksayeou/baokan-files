(Zhangjiakou, 28th Dispatch) Railway, electricity, telecommunications, waterworks, and all public enterprise factories and workers in Zhangjiakou City enthusiastically welcome the People's Liberation Army with heroic protection of factories and machinery and active resumption of work. Under the protection of the workers and staff, the above-mentioned factory machinery and equipment are all intact. Water, electricity, and telephones have never been interrupted. The Telecommunications Bureau resisted enemy sabotage three times. The former Joint Logistics Department's automobile repair factory, before the enemy's breakout on the 23rd, ordered the destruction of all machinery, but the factory workers gathered more than 30 guns and organized to defend the factory. The Railway Bureau, to avoid enemy sabotage, buried electric bulbs, telephones, tools, etc. Their slogan was: "Every blade of grass and tree here belongs to us, resolutely protect it and hand it over to the People's Liberation Army." In order to quickly restore traffic, 522 workers of the Railway Bureau completed the replacement and repair of four kilometers of track and sleepers, and the erection of a 15-meter-long bridge in 36 hours. On the morning of the 27th, the Ping-Sui Railway from Zhangyuan to Qinghuayuan, 12 miles west of Beiping, was opened to traffic, and at the same time, the western section also began construction. The automobile repair factory repaired vehicles for our army, working day and night. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, the workers of the Electricity Administration quickly cut off the power supply to the Fu bandit's power grid to ensure the safety of the PLA entering the city. The Telecommunications Bureau has now begun to repair the Zhangyuan-Xuanhua line. All the workers of the former Fendou Daily (Struggle Daily) completed the task of printing more than 20,000 copies of propaganda materials on the evening of the day our army entered the city, and on the 26th, the Zhangjiakou Daily was officially published in the city. The factories of various public enterprises are now actively preparing to resume work.

(Ji Re Cha, 29th Dispatch) After the recovery of Xuanhua, Huailai, Xiayuan, Kangzhuang and other places in the eastern section of Ping-Sui Railway, the Military Control Commission was immediately established to actively engage in restoration work. After the liberation of Huailai County, the Military Control Commission entered the city to work. With the active assistance of the people of the city, social order was quickly restored, and the registration of personnel from enemy and puppet agencies has been largely completed. Nine street offices have been officially established, and the county cooperative promotion agency is transporting grain to adjust prices and stabilize people's lives. On the second day of the liberation of Xuanhua City, after workers rushed to repair it, the lights were turned on again on the 12th, and most of the city and outside telephones were also connected. Merchants whose families were in the liberated areas wrote letters to report their safety when the post office opened mail to the liberated areas on the 15th. Most of the city's 724 shops are open for business, and eight primary schools have resumed classes. In Xiayuan, an important industrial area in Chahar Province, most of the old employees of the station, telecommunications bureau, power plant, and coal mine who had not left their posts have reported for duty. In order to take care of the lives of employees, the Military Control Commission temporarily distributed some corn and food to each person before the salary standard was set. The primary school officially resumed classes on the 9th. Since the Military Control Commission announced the currency ratio, the number of shops and stalls in the market has increased. Under the leadership of the working group of the Military Control Commission, the Bao Xing Coal Mine, the largest in Chahar Province, whose employees remained on duty, actively engaged in restoration work, and all of them resumed work on the 11th. Gao Che will also be sending coal in the next few days. Workers automatically organized pickets to protect machinery, materials and other public property day and night, and trade unions were also temporarily organized to assist in management. Some employees who stayed in the factory were initially concerned because they did not understand our party's policies. The working group immediately convened a joint meeting of employees to explain our party's policy towards enterprise employees. They gradually felt relieved and wrote letters to the escaped employees and technicians, asking them to return to work as soon as possible.
