　　Opinions on the Relationship Between State-Owned and Publicly-Owned Trading Departments
　　Tian Liu
　　In the Jinan District of Hebei Province, there is a common saying: "The National Trading Company is like the Field Army, and the Jianhua Company is like the Local Army." However, in the market, their actions are not as coordinated as armies on the battlefield, with unified steps and joint fire against the enemy. On the contrary, the more common the task, the more intense the competition. For example, this year when purchasing military cloth, the Administrative Office allowed Jianhua to purchase 60% and the National Trading Company 40%. Based on the correct exchange ratio of various goods and the interests of the weavers, the National Trading Company purchased cloth in Linqing city at a price slightly higher than the market price, stipulating nine yuan per double foot. Jianhua Company also purchased in Linqing city, but offered ten yuan. In order to complete the task of purchasing military cloth, the National Trading Company had to offer ten yuan as well. Later, Jianhua offered eleven yuan, and the National Trading Company, fearing the disruption of the proper ratio of various goods, especially the ratio of grain to cloth, had to stop purchasing. In October of this year, also in Linqing, the price of cotton soared by 57% in eighteen days, and the quality decreased by 10% to 20%, causing extreme market disorder. The main reason for this was the competitive purchasing by more than twenty state-owned, public, and agency stores, which not only made it difficult for state trading agencies to control and stabilize prices, but also directly affected the state's procurement tasks. The same thing happened in Handan city in October, but it was expressed in a different form than in Linqing. They divided the territory: the National Trading Agency was only allowed to buy south of Handan city, while Jianhua Company bought north of Handan city. This weakened the leading power of the National Trading Agency in the market, not only in business but also geographically. In September, when the state tightened the currency, the Handan State-Owned Trading Company was selling a large amount of goods to withdraw currency and complete the state's task of tightening currency, but the Jinnan Third Special District Agency's production, Dong Sheng Store, not only did not cooperate but instead threw 400,000 yuan of paper money into the market... There are many such things. State-owned trading companies, public stores, and agency production are not connected in the market, each acting independently, and even competing with and guarding against each other.

　　This is a leadership problem for state-owned, public, and agency production organs, and this leadership problem is based on the task, division of labor, and mutual relationship of the three. I believe that state-owned, public, and agency production organs should divide their labor. The five major materials (cotton, grain, cloth, salt, and oil) operated by state trading agencies should not be operated by public stores, so as to avoid the phenomenon of competitive purchasing and mutual cancellation of strength. When necessary, in order to complete a procurement or sales task, the National Trading Company may entrust public stores to purchase or sell on its behalf, but it must be carried out under the guidance of the National Trading Agency's price policy. Each public store in the same market should be led and guided by the local government and government trading agency in terms of policy and business. When large purchases or sales are sufficient to affect the market, the consent of the government and trading agency should be obtained first, in order to facilitate the leadership and control of the market by the trading agency, so that state-owned and public economic and trade departments form a unified economic whole in the market, and exert greater leadership over the cooperative economy and the private economy.

　　对国营与公营贸易部门间相互关系问题的意见
    田流
    在冀南区普遍的流行着这样的说法：“国家贸易公司是野战军，建华公司是地方军。”但表现在市场上却不象军队在战场上一样的协同动作，步调一致，共同射击敌人；相反的，任务越是共同的，竞争越是剧烈。如今年采购军布时，行署让建华采购十分之六，国家贸易公司十分之四。国家贸易公司根据着各种货物正确的交换比价，和织布者的利益，以稍高于市价的价格在临清市收买，规定九元一双市尺布，建华公司也在临市购买，却出十元。国家贸易公司为了完成购买军布的任务，也只得出十元的价格。以后建华又出十一元，贸易公司怕破坏了各种货物的正当比价，尤其是粮布的比价，只好停止了购买。今年十月也是在临清，棉价十八天内暴涨百分之五十七，质量降低了百分之十至二十，造成市场极度紊乱。其主要原因便是二十多家国营、公营、机关商店的抢购争购，不但使国家贸易机关对物价不易掌握其平稳，还直接的影响了国家的采购任务。十月在邯郸市也有同样的事情，不过和临清表现的不是一个形式，他们划分了地盘，国家贸易机关只许在邯市以南买，建华公司则在邯市以北买，这样不但在业务上，而且在地区上，都削弱了国家贸易机关对市场的领导力量。九月间国家紧缩货币时，邯市国营贸易公司正大量的出售货物，以使货币回笼，完成国家紧缩通货的任务，但冀南三专区机关生产东升货栈不但不配合，反倒一下抛出四十万元纸币于市场………这样的事情是不少的。国营贸易公司、公营商店、机关生产在市场上没有联系，各自为政，甚至互相争购，互相戒备。
    这是一个国营、公营及机关生产的领导问题，而这个领导问题又是以三者的任务、分工和相互关系为解决基础的。我认为：国营与公营与机关生产机关应该分工，国家贸易机关所经营的五大主要物资（棉、粮、布、盐、油），公营商店不应经营，以免发生争购抢购互相抵消力量的现象。必要时国家贸易公司为了完成某项采购或推销任务，可以委托公营商店代购代销，但一定要在国家贸易机关物价政策指导之下进行。在同一市场上的各公营商店，应该在政策上、业务上，受当地政府及政府贸易机关的领导和指导，遇有大宗的购入或售出足以对市场发生影响时，应先征得政府及贸易机关的同意，以便于贸易机关对市场的领导和掌握，使国营、公营经济贸易部门在市场上形成统一的经济整体，发挥其对合作经济、私人经济更大的领导力量。
