　　Family and Wife's Thinking is Backward
  　First Should Educate and Remold
　　Question: I am from Suqiu Village, Third District, Luancheng. My family is a feudal and backward family. After the county town was liberated last year, I was forced into a marriage arranged by my family. The woman is illiterate and her thinking is extremely backward, and she opposes my participation in the revolution. Therefore, we have political differences and our relationship is poor. This time I returned home, she said: "You are so addicted to revolution, can't we both live without each other? Let's just forget about the revolution (meaning divorce)." I am all for the revolution, and this is not good for me, I must break away from this marriage. I have already raised this issue with the county's judicial section, but have not yet received a reply. I hope you will forward it to the Justice Department of the North China Government for a reply.

　　Answer: Your parents and your wife's thinking is backward, which has deep historical and social roots, and is a long-term educational issue, not a matter to be dealt with as a political issue. If you and your wife do have ideological differences, a poor relationship, and cannot fulfill your marital obligations, you can file a divorce lawsuit with the judicial authorities, which will be resolved by the judicial authorities in accordance with the law.

### 家庭及妻子思想落后　首先应该教育改造

专栏：询问与答复

　　家庭及妻子思想落后
  　首先应该教育改造
    问：我是栾城三区苏邱村人，我的家庭是一个封建落后的家庭，去年县城解放后，便由家庭包办强逼下结了婚，女方是一个不识字的女人，她思想极为落后，反对我参加革命。因此我俩政治上分歧，感情恶劣。我这次回家，她说：“你革命这么上瘾，咱俩谁离了谁还不能活？革命吧，咱们就算了吧（即离婚之意）。”我是一切为了革命，这样下去对我也没好处，我一定要脱离这段婚姻关系。这个问题我早已提到本县司法科，至今未得回信，请转华北政府司法部给我一个答复为盼。

    答：你的家长和你的妻思想落后，是有着历史的社会的深厚根源的，是长期教育问题，不是依政治问题来处理的事，如果你与妻确因思想悬隔，感情不好，不能履行夫妻义务的时候，可向司法机关提起离婚诉讼，由司法机关依法解决之。
