　　When I Recover
　　I Will Return to the Battlefield to Kill the Enemy
　　Sun Bin
　　I am a deputy battalion commander of a certain unit. I was seriously wounded during the Taiyuan campaign when attacking Gaochang and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Because of a broken arm, I have been designated as a second-class disabled soldier. According to the doctor, it will be difficult to work in the future, and there will be no conditions to work on the front line.
　　However, due to the urgent development of the situation, the Chinese revolution is about to be completely victorious. In addition, as a party member and cadre, my determination to fight for the cause of the party and the people to the end has not diminished due to my disability! But whether to go to the battlefield to kill the enemy again in the future? Or to do other work in the rear? This is the question I am considering. In this consideration, I repeatedly thought: "Since participating in the revolution for more than ten years, I have been fighting on the battlefield, living a life of fighting. Now that I am disabled, I will work in other departments, leaving this disabled body behind in order to enjoy the fruits of victory." I also realized that this idea was flawed; but during convalescence, I continued to indulge in such wild thoughts.
　　Suddenly, near the New Year (the thirtieth day), the regiment sent the political instructor of the third company of my battalion to visit me and give me a certificate of merit and a hero's announcement. He also told me, "This is a merit recorded for you after being reviewed and approved by all the soldiers in the democratic meeting of the whole battalion and then approved by the senior Party committee." At the same time, he also said, "Many soldiers have sent messages asking me to recuperate well and continue working!"
　　After receiving the certificate of merit and the hero's announcement, I felt like I had obtained a priceless treasure. It was much more precious than the many慰劳品 I had received! Especially after hearing the messages from my comrades, I was moved to tears. I originally had no merit, and I felt that I had not served the soldiers wholeheartedly enough in the past, but I received such a reward from everyone, and I was a little ashamed! Everyone wants me to rest well and return to the camp to work after I recover. I regard this hope as an instruction, a mass order. I must resolutely support it! Although my body is disabled, my political life is not disabled, and my thinking has been strengthened by hating the enemy! Let's go to the battlefield to avenge the masses and ourselves! The previous idea was really wrong. The enemy is about to die. If we don't want to kill them quickly and let them live to harm people again, we will not only be sorry to the Party but also to the people! My blood will have been shed in vain this time! I will go to the battlefield soon after I recover and make more contributions to the people!

### 等我好了　再到战场去杀敌

　　等我好了
  　再到战场去杀敌
    孙斌
    我是某部一个副营长，在太原战役攻打高场时，负了重伤，到医院治疗。因折一臂，已决定为二等残废。据医生说，将来工作困难了，更没有到前线去工作的条件。
    但因时局的紧急发展，中国革命快彻底胜利，再加上自己身为党员干部，为党为人民事业奋斗到底的决心丝毫没有因残废而消极！但是将来是再到战场上去杀敌？或者到后方作其他的工作？则是我脑子里考虑的问题。在这个考虑之中，还反复的想着：“自参加革命十多年来，皆骋驰疆场，过着打仗的生活。现在已残废了，作其他部门工作，留此残废之躯，以便享受胜利之果实。”自已也想到这个思想是有毛病的；但在休养中，也就这样胡思乱想下去了。
    忽然快过年的时候（三十日），团上派我营三连政指看我，并送给我功劳证及功臣喜报。他并给我说：“这是全营民主大会上经过全体战士评论通过后，又经过了高级党委批准给你记下的功劳”。同时他还说：“很多战士捎话要我好好的休养好了后，再继续工作！”
    我得了功劳证及功臣喜报后，好象得到了无价之宝。比多次得到的慰劳品不知高贵了多少倍！特别听到了战友们捎的话，更使我感激的流下泪来。我本来没有什么功劳，又觉得自己过去在工作中全心全意为战士服务不够，可是得到了大家这样的赏赐，实在有点惭愧！大家要我好好安心休养，好了后回营工作。这个希望，我把他认为是指示，是群众性的命令。我一定要坚决的拥护！我身体虽然残废了，我的政治生命并没有残废，我的思想更由仇恨敌人而加强！去到战场上为大众为自己去报仇吧！过去的那种想法实在是不应该的。敌人快要死亡了，假若都不想去很快把它打死，让他活来再害人，不仅对不起党，对不起人民的！我这次的血也就白白流了！我要在好了之后很快的去上战场，再为人民立功！
