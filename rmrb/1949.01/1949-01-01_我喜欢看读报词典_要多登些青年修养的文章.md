　　I like reading the "Reading the Newspaper Dictionary"
  　Want more articles on youth self-cultivation
    Editor:
    After seeing your newspaper's request for reader opinions, I have some feelings and hopes to write down.
    1. I like reading study discussions, reading the newspaper dictionary, literary works, etc.
    2. I think the fourth edition should publish more materials on youth ideological cultivation and short plays suitable for the current situation and central work, such as the "Talking about the Celebrated Scholar Style" published on the 21st of this month, which has great ideological and educational significance. The "Distributing Land Certificates" (clapper talk play) published on October 4th was performed by the school theater troupe, and the masses and cadres all said it was good, suitable for the central work, and suitable for the psychology of the masses. After the performance, theater troupes from various villages came to look for this script. Its role is not small. I hope more scripts like this can be written.

　　我喜欢看读报词典
  　要多登些青年修养的文章
    编辑同志：
    见到贵报的征求读者意见后，我有些感觉与希望写出来。
    一、我喜欢看学习讨论、读报辞典、文艺作品等。
    二、我认为四版上应多登些青年思想修养方面的材料和适合当前形势与中心工作的短剧，如本月二十一日登的“谈名士派”，有很大的思想教育意义。十月四号登的“发土地证”（快板剧），经学校剧团演出，群众干部都说好，适合中心工作，适合群众心理，演出后各村剧团都来找这个剧本，它的作用是很不小的，很希望这类剧本能多写些。
