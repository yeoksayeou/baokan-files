Taiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee Proposes Specific Methods

[Taiyue Telegram] The Taiyue District Committee, in the Taiyue Xinhua Daily, introduced the methods proposed by the Fourth Prefectural Committee based on the situation in Jincheng regarding inspecting and improving village administration, rectifying various organizations, and finally completing party rectification, believing that what it pointed out has the necessity of being introduced for reference by various regions. (1) It is necessary to clearly recognize that the purpose of inspecting village administration is to further and thoroughly resolve the issues of Party members and cadres infringing upon the interests of the masses, correct behaviors that are divorced from the masses, establish the idea and style of serving the masses, and make necessary improvements to village administration. Therefore, all issues related to Party members and cadres that were not resolved or could not be resolved in the preliminary Party rectification and land reform, such as unfair grain requisition, fund allocation, corvée, embezzlement, occupation, using public office for private gain, personal retaliation, rape of women, and forced marriage, must be thoroughly and satisfactorily resolved in this stage of inspecting village administration. The resolution of these issues should proceed from reality, and according to the specific circumstances of each village and the urgent demands of the masses, prioritize and address them with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner; do not resolve whatever is encountered, or do whatever is desired. (2) In inspecting village administration, it is necessary to fully promote democracy so that the broad masses can express their opinions without concern and develop their enthusiasm. This is the key to determining the success or failure of inspecting village administration. For opinions raised by the masses, those that are correct should be accepted with humility and sincerity and resolutely corrected; those that are incorrect or based on misunderstandings should be clarified to the masses by explaining the truth of the matter. It should be known that the masses demand to speak, demand democracy, but have concerns about retaliation, fear that speaking will not work, and fear being taken advantage of by cadres. Therefore, Party members and cadres cannot scold the masses or even retaliate just because the opinions raised by the masses are inappropriate or inconsistent with the facts. Only those who truly intend to retaliate and those with ulterior motives should be subjected to appropriate struggle. The method of inspecting village administration: based on understanding the situation, the issues to be resolved should first be discussed separately among Party members, cadres, and the masses. When the understanding of the situation is in-depth and close to maturity, then take the form of meetings, which can be based on the Farmers' Association and Farmers' Representative Conference to mobilize the masses to inspect work and solve problems. (3) The behavior of militia and public security officers related to infringing upon the interests of the masses should be resolved at the same time as inspecting village administration. Those who have not paid enough attention in the past should immediately correct it and pay close attention to it. Village administration cadres who are supported by the broad masses should generally be elected by democratic methods. Individual good ones can be retained without re-election with the consent of the masses. Emphasis should be placed on improving the democratic system (Editor's note: After the end of Party rectification, the relationship between cadres and the masses is improved, and the remaining problems are completely resolved, village administration cadres should be generally elected by the masses once.) The Farmers' Associations that are not sound should also be thoroughly rectified at this time. (4) The issuance of land certificates should be carried out on the basis of the imminent completion of the inspection of village administration. In the inspection of village administration, publicity for the issuance of land certificates and necessary registration work can be carried out. The issuance of land certificates should be based on self-reporting and public discussion. For certain disputes that arise during the issuance of land certificates that cannot be resolved, a lottery method should be adopted to resolve them, and universal measurement should not be formed. After all disputes have been largely resolved, what remains is the filling out and issuance. At this time, in addition to retaining the necessary personnel to fill out and issue land certificates in conjunction with village cadres, all other cadres should quickly transfer to work areas. (5) This work must finally complete the task of Party rectification, and it must be earnestly done: First, those who should be expelled and cleaned up and those who must be punished must be handled seriously and cautiously to strengthen the purity of the Party, or necessary disciplinary sanctions should be imposed to educate Party members; second, absorb activists who have contact with the masses, high class consciousness, and have emerged in the movement into the Party to replenish the Party's fresh blood. In absorbing Party members, it is necessary to strictly follow the Party Constitution and the District Committee's notice to carry out, and those who have not paid enough attention to this should immediately correct it; third, finally adjust the leadership of the branch in a democratic way, and establish the branch's democratic system and democratic life. When solving these problems, it should be combined with the basic knowledge education of the Party, such as explaining the conditions for Communist Party members, the tasks of the branch, etc. The content of inspecting village administration is mainly the content of Party rectification, and Party rectification should be carried out in combination with the inspection of village administration, and a separate Party rectification should not be carried out outside the inspection of village administration. After the inspection of village administration is completed, the branch can convene a branch meeting with the participation of mass representatives, summarize Party rectification, review Party members in conjunction with mass opinions, announce the results of Party rectification to the masses, and determine the direction of the branch's efforts. And shift the branch's central task in the future to leading rural production. (6) After the inspection of village administration is completed, the central task is production, and it should be carried out according to the production arrangements.

　　结合改进村政最后完成整党
  　太岳四地委提出具体办法
    【太岳电】太岳区党委在太岳新华日报上，介绍四地委根据晋城情况提出的关于检查改进村政，整顿各种组织，最后完成整党的办法，认为其中所指出的有介绍供各地参照的必要。（一）必须明确认识检查村政的目的，是为了进一步深入地、贯彻地解决党员干部侵犯群众利益，纠正脱离群众的行为；树立为群众服务的思想和作风；并对村政作必要的改进。因此，凡在初步整党结束土改中，没有解决或不能解决的问题如派粮、派款、派差不公、贪污、霸占、假公济私、个人报复、强奸妇女、强制婚姻等与党员干部有关者，均必须在检查村政这段工作中求得彻底地完满的解决。对这些问题的解决应从实际出发，要按照各村具体情况，群众的迫切要求，分出缓急轻重，有重点、有步骤地去进行解决；不要遇见什么就解决什么，或想搞啥就搞啥。（二）在检查村政中必须充分发扬民主，使广大群众无顾虑地提出意见，并发扬他们的积极性。这是决定检查村政成功和失败的关键。对群众所提意见，对的应虚心诚恳接受坚决改正；不对的或出于误会的，应说明事情真象向群众解释清楚。须知群众是要求说话，要求民主的，但有顾虑怕报复，怕说了不顶事，怕吃干部的亏。因此党员干部不能因为群众提的意见欠妥当或与事实不符，就漫骂群众甚至实行报复。只有对那些真正蓄意报复与别有用心的人，才应进行适当的斗争。检查村政的方式：应根据了解情况，把要解决的问题首先在党员干部及群众中分别进行酝酿，对情况深入了解到接近成熟时，然后采取会议的形式，可以农会、农代会为主发动群众检查工作，解决问题。（三）对民兵、公安干事有关侵犯群众利益方面的行为，应与检查村政同时求得解决。凡过去注意不够者应即行纠正过来，切实加以注意。检查村政后，村政干部为广大群众所拥护者，一般的用民主方法选举，个别的好的群众同意，可不改选，应着重于健全民主制度（编者按：整党结束，干群关系改善，遗留问题完全解决之后，村政干部应普遍由群众选一次。）对农会有不健全者此时也应切实加以整顿。（四）土地证的颁发，要在检查村政快结束的基础上去进行。在检查村政中，可进行发土地证的宣传与必要的登记工作。发土地证采取自报公议，对发土地证时所产生的某些相持不下的争议，应采取抽文的方式进行解决，不要形成普遍丈量。所发生的一切争议大体解决后，留下的就是填发问题了。这时除留必要的人结合村干部进行填发土地证外，其余所有干部应迅速转移工作地区。（五）这段工作必须最后完成整党任务，要切实做到：第一、对应开除清洗者及必须处分者，必须严肃谨慎的作最后处理，加强党的纯洁性，或作必要的纪律制裁以教育党员；第二、吸收与群众有联系、阶级觉悟高、在运动中涌现出的积极分子入党，充实党的新鲜血液。在吸收党员时，必须严格遵照党章与区党委通知去进行，对此注意不够的要立即改正过来；第三、最后按照民主方式调整支部领导，建立支部的民主制度与民主生活。在解决这些问题时，应与党的基本知识教育结合起来，如讲共产党员的条件、支部的任务等。检查村政的内容，主要的也就是整党的内容，应作检查村政中结合进行整党，不应在检查村政之外，另搞一段整党。在村政检查完毕后，支部可召开有群众代表参加的支部大会，总结整党，结合群众意见审查党员，向群众宣布整党结果，决定支部的努力方向。并把支部今后的中心任务，转入领导农村生产上去。（六）在检查村政结束后，中心任务就是生产，应根据生产布置去进行。
