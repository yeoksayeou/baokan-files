Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Reports from all sides: The armistice negotiations between Israel and Egypt were held on Rhodes Island, south of Turkey, on the 13th, under the auspices of Peng Qu, the so-called "mediator" of the United Nations representative. On the eve of the negotiations, British imperialism carried out military intimidation against Israel, concentrating its Mediterranean fleet on the islands of Cyprus and Malta, and sending troops to Gaza (western Palestine). With the approval of the United States, they also landed at Aqaba in southern Jordan. They are also building fortifications on the Palestinian border and deploying field guns aimed at targets inside Palestine. At the same time, the Arab Legion has been placed under British command. Amman Airport, the capital of Jordan, has been taken over by the British, and the streets of Amman are filled with British troops.

This act of British imperialism in disrupting peace in the Middle East has aroused protests from all parties. The Israeli government has formally lodged a complaint with the UN Security Council. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement demanding the withdrawal of British troops from the Middle East and the complete implementation of the UN resolution on the partition of Palestine. British progressive parliamentarians, Mills and Pritt, also demanded that the British government stop interfering in the conflict between Egypt and Israel and recognize the State of Israel.

　　用武力恫吓以色列英帝进军巴勒斯坦
  　英共声明要求英军撤离
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报导：以色列与埃及之间的休战谈判，在所谓联合国代表“调解专员”彭区主持下，于十三日在土耳其南面的罗得岛举行。谈判前夕，英帝国主义对以色列实行武力恫吓，将其地中海舰队集中于塞普路斯岛与马尔他岛，并进兵加萨（巴勒斯坦西部），又在美国同意下，在外约旦南端的亚喀巴登陆。且在巴勒斯坦边境构筑工事，并对着巴勒斯坦以内的目标安置野炮。同时，阿拉伯军团已归英国指挥。外约旦首都安曼机场已为英方接管，安曼街上充塞着英国军队。
    英帝国主义这种破坏中东和平的行为，引起了各方抗议。以色列政府已向联合国安理会正式提出控告。英国共产党中央委员会发表声明，要求英军撤离中东，彻底实现联合国关于巴勒斯坦分治的决议。英国进步国会议员米尔斯及普利特亦要求英政府停止干涉埃及与以色列的冲突，并承认以色列国。
