　　The Secretariat of the Finance Department of the North China People's Government has established an amateur supplementary school to strengthen the cultural learning of cadres. The whole school is divided into five classes. Classes 1 and 2 study middle school Chinese language and arithmetic, as well as social development history. Each week, they study for a total of twelve hours, with six hours allocated to Chinese language, four hours to arithmetic, and two hours to development history. They write compositions every two weeks. Class 3 has more service personnel, but their cultural level is relatively better. They study the second volume of elementary school Chinese and the eighth volume of elementary school arithmetic. The teaching materials for Class 4 are the fourth volume of elementary school Chinese and arithmetic, and for Class 5, the second volume of elementary school Chinese and arithmetic. Classes 3, 4, and 5 practice calligraphy two times a week and have a monthly exam at the end of each month. The school provides learning supplies. Everyone is very enthusiastic about learning. In particular, the service personnel all say, "In the past, our families were poor and couldn't afford school. Now we must seize the opportunity to study hard, or we won't be able to keep up with the development of the situation."
