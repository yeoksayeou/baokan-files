　　Ping Shan County Youth League Organizes Youth to Participate in Winter Study Experience
    Since the beginning of winter, many village cadres have somewhat relaxed their leadership of winter studies due to being too busy with work. They have not established winter study committees, nor have they specifically trained winter study teachers. Textbooks and lamp oil, etc., have also not been resolved in a timely manner. Under these circumstances, the county's Youth League decided to make assisting the government in running winter studies its main task this winter.

    League members began by using existing study groups as a foundation, or by having league members go out to unite young people to form new study groups. In this way, with league members as the backbone, study groups gradually developed into winter studies from small to large. In Beijieguan, there were only four league members at the beginning, but in less than half a month, it developed to more than thirty people. Yan Village used the original study group as a basis, and league members mobilized others, and soon fourteen or fifteen people came to study. The same was true in Jinzhang Village, where more than forty people participated in winter studies. Yanzitou also developed more than twenty people. In Danyang Village, six league members developed into twenty-four or five people after studying for a short time.

    The study method, whether with few or many people, was to divide students into classes according to their educational level, but the class division was only limited to large classes. At other times, it was still group study. League members and active elements in the study became the backbone of each group, with some serving as group leaders and others as "little teachers." Generally, villages were divided into two classes, but some were divided into three classes. The advanced class studied applied writing (writing letters, opening slips, etc.) and abacus calculations; the lower-level class studied characters, elementary school textbooks, agricultural magazines, and recognized various tickets, etc. Some also first learned village names, personal names, and numbers. They liked to learn practical knowledge such as abacus calculations and the conversion of old scales to new scales, which they could use immediately. Political lessons were lighter than in the past, and were generally only given during large classes, mainly by teachers who spoke about current affairs.

    Young women and many young men had to weave cloth or spin thread at night and did not want their studies to interfere with their production. This contradiction was well resolved in many villages. In Donglijiapo, seven league members and young people wove cloth in a cellar. They organized themselves into a study group, elected a league member as the group leader, and the group leader learned the characters from the teacher and then took time to teach them to everyone. The female league members and several young women in Beijieguan organized a study group. In order to squeeze out time to study without delaying production, they went to the teacher early in the evening, quickly learned the characters, and after class, many people who attended winter studies had not yet arrived, so they finished learning and went back to production. The young women in Shigudong brought their sewing needles and thread to class in the morning because the road was difficult to walk at night and they were afraid of wolves. They could do work before everyone arrived. In this way, they both went to school and did not delay production.

    This year, there were no special winter study teachers. Although some villages had elementary schools, the teachers had to teach elementary school students at night (because the year's harvest was not good, the common people wanted their children to pick up firewood during the day, so they had to go to school at night), so they did not have the strength to concurrently serve as winter study teachers. Under these circumstances, in addition to the teachers' best efforts to help, everyone used league members who knew more characters or asked elementary school graduates to be "little teachers." Some also invited the former winter study teachers back. The winter study in Lujiazhuang Zaichuan Village relied entirely on elementary school students who studied in other villages during the day and returned home at night to serve as "little teachers" to teach everyone. If they didn't know something, they would ask the elementary school teacher the next day and teach it again at night when they returned. The "little teacher" in Qiuling Village was an elementary school graduate and a small dictionary.

    At the beginning of the study, textbooks, stationery, and classrooms were very difficult to obtain. Many league members helped others borrow textbooks, slates, or copy textbooks. A branch secretary named Jin Chunsheng even bought stone pencils and gave them to others. League members in Shiqiao Jinzhang and other villages took the initiative to repair classrooms and blackboards, and borrowed tables and benches. League members in Wentang, Hanhu, Hefan, Xiye and dozens of other villages also mobilized young people to build cellars for winter studies.

    The number of winter study students increased day by day, and everyone was very enthusiastic about learning. Some could learn two lessons from elementary school textbooks every night, some learned more than fifty new characters in seven days, and could also write, speak, and use them. Some learned addition, subtraction, and simple multiplication on the abacus in a few nights. A deaf person in Yan Village who had been damaged by shells also participated in winter studies. He knew phonetic symbols, so others used phonetic symbols to teach him.

    Some did not want to go to school because their homes were too far from the winter study, so league members became "little teachers" to teach them individually. The peasants reflected, "This year's winter study is different from the previous methods, everyone wants to go, and what they learn can be used."

    Because league members played a leading role in running winter studies, went deep into the masses, and helped everyone solve problems, the League's prestige expanded. Huo Lianlian in Shigudong is a good example. She constantly explained the nature of the League to others. Two active members in her village's winter study, Mei Ting and Qingfen, soon joined the League with her help.

### 平山县青年团组织青年参加冬学经验

　　平山县青年团组织青年参加冬学经验
    入冬以来，许多村干部因为工作太忙，对冬学领导有些放松，没有成立冬学委员会，也没有专门训练冬学教员，课本灯油等，也未及时解决。在这种情形下，该县的青年团便决定以帮助政府办好冬学为今冬的主要任务。
    团员开始以原有的学习组为基础，或由团员分头去团结青少年成立新的学习组。就这样以团员为骨干，由小到大地学习组便逐渐发展成了冬学。北街关开始只有四个团员，不到半月发展到三十多人。阎庄以原来的学习组为基础，由团员去动员别人，很快地就有十四五人来学习。近掌村也是这样，有四十多人参加了冬学。雁子头也发展了二十多人。单羊村六个团员学习不久，也发展至二十四、五人。
    学习方法在人少和人多时都按照文化程度分班学习，但分班只限制大课时用，其他时间仍是小组学习。团员和学习中的积极分子成了每组的骨干，有的当组长，有的当小先生。一般的村都是分两班学习，也有的分三班，高级班学应用文（写信、开条子等）珠算；低级班学生字、小学课本、庄稼杂志，认各种票子等，也有的先学村名、人名、数目字等。对珠算及老秤合新秤等学了就用得着的生活常识，他们都喜欢学习。政治课较过去轻，一般村都是在上大课时才有，主要由教员讲时事。
    青年妇女和许多青年男人晚上要织布或纺线，不愿因为学习妨碍他们的生产。这一矛盾在许多村解决的很好。东李家坡七个团员和青年们在一个地窨里织布，他们组织成学习组，选了一个团员当组长，组长到教员那里学会了字、回来再抽时间教给大家。北街关的女团员和几个女青年组织的学习组，为了挤出时间学习，不误生产，晚上早早到教员那里很快的学会字，上完课，好多上冬学的人还没有来，她们就学完回去生产了。石古洞的女青年，因晚上路不好走，又怕狼，便用上午的时间带着针线来上课，大家未到齐前还可做活。这样既上了学，又没误生产。
    今年没有专门的冬学教员，有的村虽有小学校，但教员晚上要给小学生上课（因今年年景不好，老百姓要孩子白天拾柴，只好晚上上学），就没有力量兼任冬学教员。在这情形下，除了教员尽力帮助外，大家用识字多的团员或请完小学生当小先生，也有的把从前的冬学教员又请了出来。鲁家庄枣川村的冬学，全靠白天在外村上学晚上回家的小学生当小先生，来教大家学习，他不会的，第二天问小学教员，晚上回来再教下去。邱岭村的小先生是完小学生和一本小字典。
    刚开始学习时，课本、文具、教室都很困难。许多团员便帮助别人借课本、石板或抄课本。有个团支书金春生还买了石笔送给别人，石桥近掌等村的团员主动的修理了教室和黑板，借桌凳。温塘、寒虎、河范、西冶等几十个村子的团员也发动了青年修盖上冬学的地窨。
    冬学的学生一天天多起来，大家学习很起劲，有的每晚能学会小学课本两课，有的七天学会五十多个生字，并且还会写会讲会用，有的几天晚上就学会了珠算的加减法和简单的乘法。阎庄有个被炮弹震坏了的聋子也参加了冬学，他认识国音字母，别人就用国音字母教他学习。
    有的因家离冬学太远，不愿上学，团员就做小先生去单独教他们学习。农民反映说：“今年的冬学和往年的办法不一样，都愿去，学了就能用。”
    因为团员在办冬学中，普遍起了带头作用，深入到群众中去，帮助大家解决了问题，团的威信便扩大了。石古洞的霍联联便是一个好的例子，她不断向别人解释团的性质，她村冬学中的两个积极分子梅廷和清芬不久就因她的帮助参加了团。  　　　（平山县新民主主义青年团筹委会）
