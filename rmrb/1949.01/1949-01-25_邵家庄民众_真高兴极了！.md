　　The People of Shaojia Village
  　Are Extremely Happy!
    Northeast People's Liberation Army: After hearing the news that you are directly approaching Pingjin, we are so happy that we don't know what to do! Singing loudly! Shouting loudly! Neither can express our joyful mood. Recalling your past achievements and your brave annihilation of the enemy, it truly fills us with utmost admiration. You have brought free and happy days to the entire people of the Northeast. And for the liberation of North China and the liberation of all of China, you have worked hard to climb mountains and cross rivers to eliminate the enemies in North China. How can we not be grateful! We welcome you to jointly liberate North China! Liberate all of China!
    　The Entire People of Shaojia Village, Sixth District, Huolu

  　真高兴极了！
    东北人民解放军：听到你们直逼平津的消息以后，我们高兴的不知怎样才好，大声的歌唱吧！高呼吧！都不能表达我们快乐的心境。回想起你们以往的战绩，歼敌的英勇，真是使我们万分的羡慕。你们使整个东北的人民得到自由快乐的日子。更为了解放华北解放全中国，你们辛苦地爬山、过水来消灭华北的敌人。我们该怎样的感激呀！我们欢迎你们共同解放全华北！解放全中国！
