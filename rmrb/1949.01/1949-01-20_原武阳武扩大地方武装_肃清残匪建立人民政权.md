　　[Ji Luyu Electric] In the newly recovered areas of Yangwu and Yuanwu counties in the southwestern part of the Fourth District, after more than two months of restoration work, the people's democratic governments in various districts have been largely established. Local puppet organization personnel have surrendered and repented one after another, and social order has been initially stabilized. Since the liberation of the two counties last autumn, our People's Government has been conducting extensive propaganda to win over personnel of the puppet organizations to register their repentance. At the same time, it has mobilized armed forces to carry out the suppression of scattered bandits in hiding. Under these circumstances, except for a few key figures such as Xing Dexin and Luo Tuicheng, the puppet county heads of the two counties, who were wounded, and Zhang Xianyi and Sun Laiqin, the puppet self-defense battalion commanders, who fled one after another, the other personnel of the puppet organizations have mostly registered their repentance with our democratic government and handed over files, weapons, and public property. The Yuanwu Puppet Police Bureau and County Government surrendered in an orderly manner after receiving instructions from our democratic government. The first and third squadrons of the puppet self-defense force in the county and the second squadron in Yangwu also surrendered collectively. Many township chiefs also led their office staff to register with the democratic government, hand over all firearms, and complete the various procedures designated by the democratic government. In addition, there were many individual bandits and puppet organization personnel who registered their repentance and handed over their guns. After repenting, Jin Yuebin, a puppet senator of Yuanwu, cooperated with our side to find two machine guns and more than ten rifles. In total, we received and seized 14 machine guns, 448 rifles, 70 Mauser pistols, 20 revolvers, one telephone switchboard, 15 single telephones, eight coils of wire, three mimeograph machines, and 15 horses, and most of the archives. We also captured Yue Huating, deputy commander of the puppet Sixth Detachment, Zhou Zihe, speaker of the puppet Yangwu County Senate, and many others. At present, the democratic governments of various districts have been largely established, and a large number of local intellectuals have been absorbed to participate in the work of the government, which has rapidly stabilized social order. During this period, local armed forces have also been rapidly expanded due to active activities. Some district teams have grown to 60 people, and the county brigade has nearly doubled in size (the new soldiers are mostly poor peasants). The first demand of the masses after liberation is reasonable burden. Therefore, we immediately decided to first clear the old Bao accounts, stop apportionment, and expand the publicity of the burden policy in the autumn levy, which was deeply supported by the masses. Regarding education, the two counties originally had two middle schools, three complete primary schools with middle school classes attached, fifteen complete primary schools, and 150 primary schools, most of which have now reopened.

　　原武阳武扩大地方武装
  　肃清残匪建立人民政权
    【冀鲁豫电】四分区西南部阳武、原武两县新收复区，经过两个多月来的恢复工作，各区人民民主政权大部建立，当地伪组织人员纷纷投诚悔过，社会秩序已初步安定。该两县自去秋解放后，我人民政府即一面进行广泛宣传，争取伪组织人员登记悔过；一面调集武装力量，进行对潜藏散匪的清剿。在此情况下，除少数首要分子如两县伪县长邢德馨、罗推诚已负伤、伪自卫大队长张显一、孙来勤等先后逃亡外，其他伪组织人员，均大部向我民主政府登记悔过，并交出档案、武器及公共资财。原武伪警察局及县政府是接受我民主政府指令有秩序地投诚的。该县伪自卫队第一、三等中队及阳武二中队，亦集体投诚。许多乡镇长亦均率所属办公人员向民主政府登记，交出全部枪支，办完民主政府指定应交代的各种手续。此外，个别登记悔过、交出枪支之匪伪组织人员亦很多。原武伪参议员金月宾悔过后，并协同我方搜出机枪两挺，步枪十余支。总计我共接收与缴获机枪十四挺，步枪四百四十八支，匣枪七十枝，手枪二十支，电话总机一部，单机十五部，电线八盘，油印机三部，马十五匹，档案大部。并活捉伪六支队副司令岳华亭、伪阳武县参议长周子贺等多名。目前各区民主政权已大部建立，并吸收了当地大批知识分子参加政权工作，迅速安定了社会秩序。地方武装在此时期，由于积极活动，也得到飞速的扩大，区队有的已发展到六十人，县大队扩大将近二倍（新战士多系贫苦农民）。该区群众解放后的第一个要求，是负担合理。因此我即确定首先清理旧保帐目，停止摊派，并在秋征中扩大负担政策的宣传，深得群众拥护。关于教育工作，该两县原有中学两处，完小附设中学班三处，完小十五处，小学一百五十处，现已大部开学。
