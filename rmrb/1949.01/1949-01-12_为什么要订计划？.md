　　The summary of the winter production meeting of the Fifth Administrative Office of Beiyue in November of last winter criticized Wan County, saying, "The production plan made by Wan County in July, it would be fine if it were completed in three years." This is just a very unrealistic example, and of course it cannot represent the general situation; but whether the production plan is accurate and realistic needs to be generally brought to the attention of all regions. Since the beginning of winter, we have received many winter production plans from various regions, and some regions have even sent their annual production plans for this year, but very few have explained in detail each item of their plans: for example, what the past foundation was, what specific difficulties there are now, whether they can be overcome, how to overcome them, the highest possibilities and the lowest possibilities, etc., have not been mentioned. According to what, the Fourth District of Licheng plans to organize 80 percent of the labor force and 90 percent of the animal power this winter? Can it be realized? How is it calculated to be organized? There is no explanation. According to what, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Wuxiang require each laborer to earn more than one stone of millet and each half-laborer to earn five dou (selling coal, carrying burdens, etc.) this winter? Can it be realized? There is also no explanation. Today's newspaper reported that Yangcheng plans to increase coarse grains by 60,000 shi for the whole year, specifically requiring an increase of one dou and two and a half sheng of coarse grains per mu. In order to realize this plan, the villages are actively accumulating fertilizer, buying livestock, and repairing agricultural implements, which is very good; but looking at the existing materials, we can only know how much manure a few villages have accumulated, and how many iron furnaces in the county are making agricultural implements, but we cannot explain whether the above plan can be achieved, or can be exceeded, and by how much.
　　In recent years, all regions have had plans for increasing production every year, but there have been very few detailed summaries at the end of the term, explaining which items have been achieved, which have been exceeded, or which have not been completed, and whether the reason is that the plan is not accurate or that the conditions have changed midway. At most, we can see a summary of one or several villages, saying that they have exceeded the plan, but it is also rare to be able to explain the proportion of natural causes and subjective efforts in all aspects. Therefore, when making plans in the second year, it is still not clear how these should be calculated.
　　Making plans is a detailed and scientific task, which must be based on precise investigation and research of past and present subjective and objective conditions in all aspects. For this reason, we suggest that the leading organs in all regions universally review their production plans in detail and carefully consider the possibility of their realization. This is a new task for us, and of course there are many difficulties in doing such a thing; especially in the situation where dispersed private small-scale agricultural production accounts for a very large proportion, it is not an easy thing. But precisely because of this, we are required to conduct investigation and research very seriously and diligently, and overcome the old set of methods of formalism for the sake of planning. Specifically speaking, we believe that the following work should be done:
　　First, conduct interviews and investigations with experienced workers, peasants, and district and village cadres. Because those who really understand production are the production laborers. The actual calculations from the worker and peasant surveys should be the basis for making plans. The process of investigation should also become a process of helping them make plans themselves. With the plans of individuals and households, the overall plan can have a basis.
　　As for the district and village cadres, they have been leading production for many years, and some cadres have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience. If we talk to them in detail about a draft plan, they generally know which items can be realized, which items have difficulties; even for the methods and possibilities of overcoming these difficulties, they also have many specific opinions, which are often directly from the masses. In this way, the plan of a village or a district may be made more realistically.
　　Second, specifically check and summarize the past experience and lessons of making and implementing plans, combine them with the current investigation and understanding of the situation, find out the successes and failures of previous plans and their reasons, see if the current situation and conditions have changed, and see if there are any aspects of the plans that have already been made this year that need to be revised. Those that need to be revised should be revised immediately, without delay or carelessness.
　　In short, it would be good if we could make plans according to the specific conditions of the time and place and the experience and lessons of previous years, plus the good review of the leading organs, and the regular inspection and assistance in the implementation.

### 为什么要订计划？

　　为什么要订计划？
    北狱五专署去冬十一月冬季生产会议的总结中，曾对完县提出批评，说：“完县七月份作的生产计划，三年完成了也不错。”这仅是一个很不切合实际的例子，当然不能代表一般；但生产计划的是否精确、是否切合实际，却需要一般地提起各地注意。入冬以来，我们收到各地许多冬季生产计划，有的地区已寄来了今年全年生产计划，但很少有把自己计划的每一项详细说明的：比如，过去的基础如何，现在有什么具体困难，能否克服，怎样克服，最高的可能与最低的可能等，都未谈到。黎城四区计划今冬要组织起劳力百分之八十，畜力百分之九十，根据是什么？能否实现？怎样算组织起来？没有说明。武乡三、四、五、六、七区要求今冬每个劳力赚小米一石多，半劳力赚五斗（卖煤、担挑等），根据是什么？能否实现？也没有说明。今天报载阳城今年全年拟增粗粮六万石，具体要求每亩增产粗粮一斗二升五。为实现这一计划，各村已在积极积肥、买牲口、修农具，这是很好的；但看现有材料，只能知道某几村积了多少粪，县里几个铁炉在造农具，却不能说明上述计划是否能达到，或者能超过，超过多少。
    这几年来，各地年年都有增产计划，但很少有到期的细密总结，说明哪一项达到了，哪一项超过了或没有完成，其原因是计划不精确，还是中途条件变化。至多能看到一个村或若干村的总结，说他们超过了计划，但也很少能说明自然的原因与主观各方面努力的原因各占多大比重。所以，到第二年订计划时，对这些应如何计算，仍然不确切。
    订计划是一个细密的科学的工作，必须以过去的现在的各方面主客观条件的精确调查研究为基础。为此，我们建议各地领导机关都普遍把自己的生产计划详细审查一下，认真考虑一下实现的可能性。这对我们说来是一个新的工作，当然做这样的事是有许多困难的；特别在分散的私有的小农生产占着极大比重的情形下，并不是容易的事情。但正因为如此，就更要求我们十分认真，十分努力地进行调查研究，克服形式主义的为计划而计划的老一套方法。具体说来，我们认为应做以下工作：
    第一、向有经验的工人、农民和区村干部进行访问、调查。因为真正懂得生产的是生产劳动者。从工农调查来的实际计算，应该做为订计划的基础。调查的过程，同时也应该成为帮助他们自己订计划的过程。有了个别人与户的计划，总的计划才能有根据。
    至于区村干部，他们领导生产已经多年，有一部分干部是积累了不少知识与经验的。如果拿一个计划草案详细和他们谈谈，他们大体知道哪一项能实现，哪一项有什么困难；甚至对克服这些困难的办法与可能，他们也有不少具体的见解，这些往往都是直接从群众中来的。这样，一个村、一个区的计划就可能订得更切实些。
    第二、具体检查总结过去订计划与实施计划的经验教训，以之与目前调查了解的情况结合考虑，弄清以前各项计划的成败及其原因，看目前的情况条件是否有了变化，看今年已订的计划是否有需要修改之处。需改者立改，不要拖延、马虎。
    总之倘能按照当时当地的具体条件及往年的经验教训，再加领导机关很好审查，执行中定期检查与帮助，那就好了。
