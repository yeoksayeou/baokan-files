    Hua Bei Mao Zong Shang Qing Ke
    (December 15th – December 27th)
    This ten-day period coincides with the end of the year, resulting in an increase in the consumption of all goods, and a general and active rise in prices, especially for grain and oil. Regionally, the price increases are most pronounced in the northern part of the North China region, the area west of East China, the area along the Dezhou-Shijiazhuang railway line, and the southern part of the Jin-Sui region. Other regions generally show a steady increase. The specific situations in our region and neighboring liberated areas are reported separately below:
    Grain
    In the North China region, continuing the situation from the previous ten-day period, grain prices in the northern areas remain prominent. The area bordering the central Hebei region and the northwest of the North Yue region (Ding County, Anguo, Quyang, Fuping, Xingtang, Laiyuan, etc.) and the area along the Dezhou-Shijiazhuang railway line saw the most rapid increase from the 15th to the 22nd and 23rd, reaching a peak. The average price of millet reached about 750 yuan per catty, wheat reached as high as 1,000 to 1,100 yuan, and miscellaneous grains averaged 580 to 680 yuan per catty. Compared to the previous ten-day period (the 15th), the prices of millet and wheat increased by 30% to 34%, and miscellaneous grains increased by 66% to 94%. By the 24th, after our state-owned businesses vigorously sold goods to regulate the market, prices began to fall, starting in Shijiazhuang (the price of millet fell from 750 yuan to 550 yuan per catty, and wheat fell from 1,000 yuan to 750 yuan).
