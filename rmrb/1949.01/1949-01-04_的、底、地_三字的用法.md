Usage of "的, 底, 地"
    Si Wei
    In many submissions, and even in our own newspaper, we often find instances where the characters “的,” “底,” and “地” are used improperly. The reason is that some comrades do not pay attention to or do not understand grammar, and when they write, they rely solely on their own habits, not knowing how to distinguish between these three characters. This sometimes leads to errors that distort the meaning. I will now explain the usage of these three characters separately:
    First, the character "的" generally has three usages: (1) Used as a pronoun (to replace nouns, to avoid repetition of nouns) - for example: "He is a worker 的." "He is a master of Marxism-Leninism 者." The "的" in the first sentence and the "者" in the second sentence can both represent "person," so the character "的" can be used as a pronoun. (2) Used as the ending of an adjective (a word used to distinguish the nature, quantity, form, or status of things) - for example: "Zhang Jun is a sharpshooter who hits the target every time 百发百中 的." "Tens of thousands 千千万万 的 farmers have organized." Here, the character "的" is used at the end of the adjectives "百发百中" and "千千万万." (3) Used as an affirmative auxiliary particle (used to supplement the tone of speech) - for example: "I will always remember 记得 的." "If the enemy does not surrender, they will certainly be eliminated 一定要被消灭 的." The character "的" in both sentences expresses the completion and affirmation of the tone.
    Second, the character "底" is generally used as a possessive preposition (introducing a substantive word to a thing, indicating that the substantive word is the owner of the thing) - for example: "The Chinese people 底 cause of liberation is developing rapidly." "Her 底 son joined the People's Liberation Army." Other prepositions introduce nouns to verbs, but this character "底" introduces nouns to nouns. Originally, the general habit was to use "的" and "底" interchangeably, but for greater accuracy and science, they can also be distinguished.
    Third, the character "地" is generally used as an adverb (which describes a movement or action) ending - for example: "He raised the flag high 高高 地." "He analyzed the problem correctly 正确 地." The character "地" in both sentences is at the end of the adverbs "高高" and "正确."

　　“的、底、地”三字的用法
    四维
    在不少来稿中，甚至我们的报纸上，时常发现有把“的”、“底”、“地”三个字用得不恰当的。原因是有些同志不注意或不懂文法，写起东西来只根据各自的习惯，不知道这三个字如何区别着用，有时就产生了因词害意的毛病。现将这三个字的用法分别说明一下：
    第一是“的”字，一般有三个用法：（一）用作代名词（用来代替名词，以免名词的重复）——例如：“他是一个做工的”。“他是一个精通马列主义者”，前句中的“的”和后句中的“者”字，都可以代表“人”了，所以“的”字可作代名词用。（二）用作形容词（用来区别事物的性质、数量、形态或地位的词）的语尾——例如；“张俊是一个百发百中的神枪手”。“千千万万的农民组织起来了”。却把“的”字用在“百发百中”和“千千万万”等形容词的语尾。（三）用作助词（用来补助说话语气的）的肯定助词——例如：“我永远记得的”。“敌人不投降，一定要被消灭的”。两句中的“的”字。都表示语气的完结和肯定。
    第二是“底”字，一般是当领有介词（介绍一个实体词给一个事物，说明这个实体词是该事物的所有者）用——例如：“中国人民底解放事业迅速发展”。“她底儿子参加了人民解放军”。别的介词是介绍名词给动词，这个“底”字却是把名词介绍给名词。本来一般习惯是“的”、“底”通用的，为了更正确、更科学，也可区别开用。
    第三是“地”字，一般是当副词（是用来形容一个运动或一个动作的叫副词）语尾用——例如：“他高高地举起旗子”，“他正确地分析问题”。两句中的“地”字都在副词“高高”与“正确”的语尾。
