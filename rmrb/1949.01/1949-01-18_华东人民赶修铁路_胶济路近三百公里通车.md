Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th—The 7,000 employees of the East China Railway Administration Bureau, assisted by hundreds of thousands of people, repaired more than 300 kilometers of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Jiaoji Railway, and branch lines, as well as 106 small railway bridges in three months. As a result, the 360-kilometer Jinan-Xuzhou section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the 262-kilometer Jinan-Fangzi section of the Jiaoji Railway were officially opened to traffic on New Year's Day this year. According to preliminary statistics, this rush repair used 820,000 cubic meters of earth, nearly 370,000 railway sleepers, 46,000 rails, more than 1.47 million spikes, and more than 100,000 fishplates and bolts.

　　After liberation, railway employees worked very actively in the rush repair. The 130 kilometers between Guodian and Yidu on the Jiaoji Line and the 94 kilometers between Yanzhou and Lincheng on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway were completed within 40 days. The second bridge construction team of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, with more than 50 people, repaired 20 bridges in 32 days. After Wu, a 70-year-old supervisor, was injured in a fall while repairing a bridge, others advised him to return to Yanzhou to rest, but he came back on the third day with crutches. Ren Ruxin, a supervisor in the section, said, "In the Kuomintang era, 16 scaffolding frames were used to nail fishplates, with two to three people per frame, and at most 2.4 kilometers were nailed in a day. Now, with only 12 scaffolding frames, we can nail more than 3 kilometers a day." The second bridge construction team of the Jiaoji Railway, with more than 50 people, repaired 14 iron bridges in 40 days. The 23 engineers, construction workers, and surveyors dispatched by the Railway Administration Bureau, under the difficult conditions of lacking instruments and important tools, organized workers to work in shifts, "resting people but not tools," so that the rush repair project was completed ahead of schedule. The 1,600 employees in the Railway Bureau factory overcame the difficulties of material shortages, made extensive use of previously discarded materials, and in more than two months, they produced more than 57,000 spikes, more than 13,000 fishplate bolts and fishplates, and repaired 14 locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. In assisting the rush repair of the railway, the vast number of peasants along the line, in addition to actively participating in the construction of roadbeds, laying ballast, adding earthwork, and carrying ties, farmers in some villages also organized road protection teams, carrying earthen guns and broadswords to patrol along the line.

　　华东人民赶修铁路
  　胶济路近三百公里通车
    【新华社华东十五日电】华东区铁路管理总局所属的七千员工，在数十万人民的协助下，三个月中间赶修了津浦铁路、胶济铁路及支路共三百余公里，小铁桥一百零六座。因而使津浦路的济南徐州段三百六十公里和胶济路的济南坊子段二百六十二公里铁路，在今年元旦得以正式通车。据初步统计：这次赶修共用土八十二万立方公尺，枕木近三十七万根，钢轨四万六千根，道钉一百四十七万余个，夹板螺丝各十万以上。
    解放后的铁路员工在赶修中工作都很积极。胶济线的郭店、益都间一百三十公里及津浦路兖州临城段九十四公里，都在四十天以内竣工。津浦路第二桥工队五十余人三十二天修桥二十座。七十岁的吴老监工修桥摔伤后，别人劝他暂回兖州休息，他却在第三天又撑着拐杖来了。该段监工任如信说：“国民党时代，十六付架子钉夹板，每付两人至三人，一天最多钉二公里四，现在只十二付架子，一天能钉三公里还多。”胶济路第二桥工队五十多人，四十天修了十四座铁桥。铁路管理局派出的二十三名工程师、工务员及测绘员，在缺乏仪器和重要工具的困难条件下，组织工人们轮流干活，“歇人不歇工具”，使赶修工程提前完成。铁路局工厂中千六百职工克服了原料缺乏的困难，大量利用过去遗弃的材料，二个多月来共打道钉五万七千余个，鱼尾螺丝帽及鱼尾夹板各一万三千余个，修理机车、客货车十四部。在协助赶修铁路中沿线广大农民除积极参加修筑路基、铺道床、添土方、扛道木外，有些村庄的农民还组织护路小组，扛着土枪大刀沿线巡逻。
