Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Slobodskii wrote in Labor News: Events in the past few weeks have shown that Italian reactionaries intend to use the winter season to launch a new offensive against the working class. Italian employers, in collaboration with the US Marshall Plan Office in Italy, have once again launched a large-scale campaign of layoffs and production cuts. This is being carried out at a time when Italian industry is only operating at 50% capacity and the actual unemployment figure is as high as 2.5 million.

The Italian working class, as in the past, bravely met this winter offensive of the reactionaries. This can be proven by the constantly increasing number and scale of strikes. Such large-scale strikes occurred in the industrial areas of Northern, Central, and Southern Italy. In many provinces of Northern Italy, as in the province of Tuscany in Central Italy, a widespread strike movement has unfolded among agricultural workers. A general strike in the food industry, involving 130,000 workers, swept across Italy. In major industrial centers, workers resolutely resisted the policy of mass layoffs and business closures. Workers who had to struggle against capitalists, landlords, and the police, as usual, received support from trade union organizations at all levels and from the broad masses of the people. Solidarity strikes were held in Naples, the entire province of Friuli (in Northern Italy), the province of Pistoia (northwest of Florence), Reggio, the province of Calabria (Southern Italy), and the island of Elba. Public servants also demonstrated an example of loyalty and trust in their trade union leaders. They participated in the general strikes of October 14th and December 12th, and they are not satisfied with the partial concessions made by the government and continue to struggle to this day.

Recently, Italian workers have increasingly adopted "go-slow" tactics in their struggle against employers, and have refused to work outside of prescribed hours. News from Italy shows that this new tactic of the working class has greatly annoyed the reactionaries. Representatives of the Saragat group in the trade unions demanded that an extraordinary meeting of the Central Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor be convened, attempting to formally prohibit workers from using this method of struggle. However, these attempts were met with due resistance from the working class and the leadership of the General Confederation of Labor. In this way, the workers greatly frustrated the plan jointly drafted by industrialists and the Marshall Plan Office to lay off 150,000 workers.

### 迎接反动派冬季攻势　意工人英勇展开斗争

　　迎接反动派冬季攻势
  　意工人英勇展开斗争
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：斯洛波特斯基于劳动报上著文称：过去数周的事情说明，意大利反动派打算利用冬令季节向工人阶级作新的进攻。意大利雇主们与美国驻意大利马歇尔计划分署协作，再次发动了大批解雇及减缩生产的运动。这是在意大利工业只开动了百分之五十、失业数字实际上高达二百五十万人的情形下进行的。
    意大利工人阶级和过去一样，勇敢地迎接了反动派的这一冬季攻势。这可以由罢工次数与规模均不断增长一事得到证明。这种大罢工发生于北意、中意、南意各工业地区。在北意的不少省份，也和在中意的多斯坎纳省一样，农业工人中间展开了广泛的罢工运动。有十三万职工参加的食品工业总罢工，席卷了全意大利。在各大工业中心，工人们坚决抗击大批解雇及停闭企业的政策。对资本家、地主及警察不得不进行斗争的职工们，照例得到了各级工会组织与广大人民阶层的支持。那不勒斯、整个福利省（在北意）、比斯多亚省（在佛罗伦萨西北）勒佐、卡拉布里亚省（意南）及厄尔巴岛等地都举行了声援的罢工。公务员们也表现了对于他们的工会领袖们忠实和信任的范例。他们参加十月十四日及十二月十二日的总罢工，他们并不满足于政府所作的部分让步而继续斗争迄今。
    近来，意大利工人在其对雇主的斗争中更不断地采取“慢吞吞”的战术，并拒绝在规定时间以外工作等。来自意大利的消息说明，工人阶级这一新的战术，使反动派大为恼火。萨拉盖特集团在工会中的代表们，要求召开总工会中央局非常会议，企图正式禁止工人使用这一斗争方法。但是，他们的这些企图受到了工人阶级及总工会领导方面的应有的还击。就这样，工人们大大地挫败了工业家与马歇尔计划分署共同拟定的解雇十五万工人的计划。
