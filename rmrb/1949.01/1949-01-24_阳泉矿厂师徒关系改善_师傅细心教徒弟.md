　　Yangquan Mine Improves Master-Apprentice Relationship
  　Masters Teach Apprentices Diligently
    [Our Dispatch] After more than a year of education, the consciousness of workers in public factories and mines in Yangquan City has greatly improved. The master-apprentice relationship has also improved, and they are actively studying and improving technology and increasing production. Workers at the Yangquan Sanhe Factory, during the period of Yan Xishan's occupation, would first inquire about whether the machines had any problems before going to work each day. If they heard that the machine was broken or that the raw materials were not supplied, they would not even enter the gate and would turn around and go home. Now, workers not only hope that the machines will not break down, but if the machines do malfunction, they are so anxious that they break out in a sweat, eager to repair them immediately. Old worker Liu Baokui said: "In the past, I hoped the machines would break down, but now I feel suffocated when the machines produce less!" When workers at the factory were rushing to repair the boiler, Li Jielin injured his foot and had difficulty walking, but he still personally participated in the rush repair. The coal mining team of Wang Zhen in the Fourth Mine often discussed the completion of production plans, worrying about falling behind. In November of last year, their team's production task was 1.3 carts per person per day, but they achieved 1.5 carts and still felt it was not enough. Wang Shuanglong, a porter at the Fourth Mine, took the initiative to bring nails from home to nail the planks on the bridge during a power outage break. When someone asked him why he wasn't resting, he said, "I already rested this morning! I saw that the bridge planks were loose, so I nailed them!" He also said: "When the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan ruled, we rested when things broke down. Today, our coal production is for everyone, and we should do as much as we can." The entire workforce of the power plant did not rest on Sunday in order to rush to repair the boiler, working all day, and did not even bother to eat in order to complete the task in one go. Regarding the master-apprentice relationship, most masters have broken away from the past idea of: "If you teach your apprentice, you will starve." The master craftsmen of the Sanhe Factory give their apprentices technical lessons two to three times a week, and they explain them carefully, explaining all the details clearly. The apprentices are also willing to listen. They said: "In the past, not only did we not teach apprentices well, but we would also beat them if they didn't understand. The more we beat them, the more confused they became, and the more they couldn't learn, the happier the master was. Because if the apprentices learned, the capitalists would fire the skilled workers and keep the apprentices, saving wages and making them easier to use. Now it's different. Teaching apprentices will not cause us to lose our jobs, and it increases the number of people producing for the country!" The X director of the power plant is an old worker. When the trade union asked him to give lessons to the workers immediately after liberation, he tried his best to speak in terms that the workers could not understand, fearing that the apprentices would surpass him. Now, because he has personally seen the Communist Party's spirit of serving the people, he has taken the initiative to divide the lessons into groups, teaching carefully, bit by bit, according to their level, fearing that the workers will not learn.

　　阳泉矿厂师徒关系改善
  　师傅细心教徒弟
    【本报讯】阳泉市公营工厂矿山职工经过一年多的教育，觉悟大为提高，又改进了师徒关系，主动的研究改进技术，增加生产。阳泉三合工厂工人在阎匪占领时期，每天上班前先打听一下机器是否出了毛病，如果听说机器坏了或者原料材料供应不上，就连门也不进扭头回家。现在工人不但盼望机器不出毛病，要是机器发生故障，他们都急的一身汗，恨不得马上修理好，老工人刘宝魁说：“以前就盼机器坏，现在机器一少出货，就心眼里闷的慌！”该厂工人在抢修锅炉的时候，李杰林的脚受了伤，走路还困难，还亲自参加抢修。四矿挖煤工人王珍小组，经常讨论生产计划的完成，担心自己落了后，去年十一月他们的组生产任务是每人每天一点三车，但是他们做到了一点五车还感觉不够。四矿搬运工人王双龙在停电休息时间，主动从家里拿来钉子钉桥上的桥板，别人问他为什么不休息，他说：“上午休息过了！我看桥板活了，钉钉它！”他又说：“日寇和阎匪统治时，坏了休息，今天咱们出煤是为了大家，能多作点事就多作点。”发电厂全体工人为了抢修锅炉，星期日不休息，干了一天，为了一口气完成任务，饭都没顾得吃。在师徒关系方面，大部师傅已打破了过去：“教会徒弟饿死师傅”的思想，三合工厂的老师傅们，每礼拜要给徒弟上两次到三次技术课，并且细心的讲，把所有的小节，都讲得清清楚楚，学徒也愿意听。他们说：“从前教徒弟，不但不好好教，徒弟不会还要打，越打越糊涂，越学不会师傅越乐。因为学徒学会了，资本家就会把技术工人辞去，留下学徒，又省工资又好用；现在不同了，教会徒弟自己不会失业，增加了为国家生产的人材！”发电厂×厂长是个老工人，刚一解放时工会请他给工人上课，讲时尽量讲工人听不懂的，怕徒弟超过他去；现在由于亲眼看到了共产党为人民服务的精神，就主动的把上课分成小组，按程度一点一点细心教，怕工人学不会。（阳泉职工报）
