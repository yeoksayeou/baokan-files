　　The Government Should Issue Small Grass Vouchers
    Editor:
    On the 14th of last month, two comrades from the 14th Column brought two head of livestock and stayed overnight in Jizhuang, Tenth District, Huixian County. The village cadres bought them twenty-five jin of straw. On the morning of the 15th, before leaving, the comrades gave them a grass voucher for ninety jin. The village cadres couldn't find change for the voucher, so the army comrades gave them a written note. The village cadres wanted money. The army comrades said: The superiors issued grass vouchers, not money. They argued with each other all the way to the District Government, but the District Government also didn't have any grass vouchers. The District asked the army comrades to give money to the village, but the army comrades were worried they wouldn't be able to get reimbursed at the team. After explaining, the District Government issued a certificate to resolve the issue.
    I suggest that the higher-ups quickly issue some grass vouchers to the localities, and also print more small grass vouchers, to solve the difficulties of comrades on the road. I also hope that all levels of supply agencies, for comrades on the road who have spent money on grass and have proof, will allow reimbursement for saved grass vouchers.

　　政府应印发小草票
    编辑同志：
    上月十四号，有十四纵队两个同志带牲口两头，晚上住在辉县十区冀庄，经村干部买了二十五斤秆草；十五号早上临行时，给草票九十斤一张，村干部因没有草票回找，部队同志给开条子，村干部要钱。部队同志说：上级发的是草料票，没有发钱。互相争执到区政府，区政府也同样没有草票。区上让部队同志给村上钱，部队同志怕到队上报销不了。后经解释，区政府开了证明才解决。
    我建议上级赶快给地方上发些草票，另外多印小草票，以解决上路同志们的困难；并希望各级供给机关，凡是上路同志，花了草钱有证明，省下草票，准予报销。
