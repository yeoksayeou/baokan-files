[Jinan Electric] Handan Electric Company, based on the principle of "mutual benefit for labor and management, and development of production," has reasonably resolved the wage issue. Since the company's resumption of work, it has only relied on temporary borrowing based on past wage outlines, and there are still no clear regulations. Due to the development of technical efficiency in the past, many unreasonable phenomena have arisen in wage treatment. For example, the technical worker Du Bin only receives 68 units, while the third-class craftsmen Feng Jinsheng and Liu Zhensheng, who have only been apprentices for two years, receive 61 to 62 units, a very small difference. Another example is Zhou Zhensheng, the foreman of the machine room, who has become quite skilled after two years of study, but his salary is lower than that of ordinary workers. This has led to low morale among some workers, and even requests for resignation. Based on the above situation, the factory decided to reorganize wages. After Manager Wang conveyed the wage policy, all employees elected representatives to form a wage evaluation committee in conjunction with the factory management committee. After evaluating the grade standards based on work attitude, technical level, position, and ability, the general assembly approved them. Then, each employee's grade and units were studied and evaluated, with the order of evaluation being cadres first, then workers and apprentices. After this evaluation, unreasonable grades and units were revised. For example, Liu Zhenjiang was lowered to 45 units, Feng Jinsheng was lowered to 47 units, while those with truly high skills received reasonable increases. For example, the internal line technician Zhao Fuming was raised from 91 units to 95 units, and Zhou Zhensheng was also promoted from second-class grade three to grade one. In the evaluation, the idea of absolute egalitarianism was opposed. At the beginning, some workers in the machine room thought that their grades should be ranked down from the first-class grade one of the internal and external line technicians, which was criticized by everyone. Full democracy was promoted, and the opinion of worker representative Yang Renxue was adopted: first, a draft plan was drawn up and verbally communicated, and after small group discussion, revision, and approval, it was formally determined, thus gaining the support of all employees. Individual apprentices who felt their wages were low also agreed under democratic evaluation. In addition, another reason for the smooth progress of the wage evaluation was the improvement of the workers' political consciousness. Boiler worker Li Qingyi voluntarily requested a pay cut, and Zhou Zhensheng requested when he was promoted to second-class grade one: "Based on my skills, I am not good enough for grade one yet. I am still young, and I will be promoted later when I improve."

　　邯郸电灯公司组评议会
  　合理解决工资问题
    【冀南电】邯郸电灯公司根据“劳资两利、发展生产”的方针，合理解决了工资问题。该公司自复工以来，只依靠过去工资轮廓临时暂借，至今仍无明确规定，由于过去技术效率的发展，使工资待遇产生很多不合理现象，如技术工人杜斌只六十八＠，而学满仅二年的三等工匠冯金声、刘振树等却达六十一至六十二＠，相差额很小。再如机器房领班工人周振声经过二年学习后技术相当熟练，但却比一般工人工资还低。因此引起某些工人情绪低落，甚至要求辞退。厂方根据以上情况，决定重整工资，经王经理传达工资政策后，即由全体职工选出代表协同工厂管委会组成了工资评委会，根据劳动态度、技术高低、职位和能力大小评订等级标准后，大会通过，然后对照研究每一职工等级、＠数，评议的次序为先职工干部后工人学徒。这样评议后，改订了不合理的等级和＠数，如刘振江降为四十五个＠，冯金声降为四十七个＠，而技术真正高者，得到合理的提高，如内线技师赵富明由九十一＠升为九十五＠，周振声也由二等三级提为一级。在评议中，反对了绝对平均思想，开始机器房有的工人认为自己等级一定按内外线技师一等一级往下排，结果遭到大家批判，充分发扬了民主，采纳了工人代表杨仁学的意见：先将订出草案口头传达，经小组讨论、修正、通过后再作正式确定，因此获得全体职工的拥护。个别学徒嫌自己工资低者，在民主评议下也取得其同意。此外工资评议顺利的另一原因，则是工人的政治觉悟的提高，锅炉工人李清壹自动要求减薪，周振声在提升为二等一级时要求说：“根据我的技术，还不够一级，我还年轻，以后进步了再提拔。”
