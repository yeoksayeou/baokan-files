    △ Soviet surgeons have successfully performed operations to remove a lobe of the lung in cases of lung cancer, pulmonary disease with chronic lung ulcers, etc. At a meeting of the Moscow Surgical Association, Professor Bakulev presented several patients who had a lobe of their lung removed after surgery. Their health is quite good. Complex lung removal surgery is no longer a rare occurrence in many Soviet hospitals.
    △ Professor Sinitzin of the Soviet Union has achieved success in experiments on transplanting hearts between cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals at the Gorky Medical Institute. In his new book "Heart Transplantation," Sinitzin stated that he transplanted a frog's heart into another frog, and then inserted another heart into the same frog. Both frogs are alive and have been alive for twelve months.
