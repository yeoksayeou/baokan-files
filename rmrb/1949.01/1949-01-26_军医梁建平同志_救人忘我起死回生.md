Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 21st: Comrade Liang Jianping, a military doctor of a certain unit of the Northeast Field Army who once won the Zhu De Medal, with a high sense of responsibility and selfless dedication to saving lives, brought severely wounded platoon leader Zhang Zhenchun back from the brink of death, once again creating a working model for medical personnel in the People's Army. Platoon leader Zhang was seriously wounded by a bullet in the abdomen on the front line. When he was transported to the hospital, Minister Peng of the Ministry of Health performed an operation to remove the shrapnel from his intestine. However, due to excessive blood loss, his pulse stopped beating after being moved from the operating room to the ward. When the Martyrs Burial Committee had already begun preparing for Zhang’s funeral, Comrade Liang Jianping arrived and conducted a thorough examination. The results confirmed that Zhang had completely stopped breathing, his limbs were ice-cold, and his muscles were beginning to stiffen, with only a slight body temperature in his torso. Doctor Liang remembered the words he had read in a Soviet medical book: "Three to five minutes after rigor mortis sets in, the brain cells are still alive. If rapid first aid can be given, there is still hope." Therefore, he immediately injected two cc of cardiac stimulant into Zhang, performed artificial respiration, and continued for half an hour. After that he injected more cardiac stimulant, instilled three cc through the nostrils, and applied hot compresses to the patient's head. Comrade Liang had already been working continuously for several days and nights. During the tense artificial respiration, beads of sweat dripped down like rain. After doing this for three hours, weak and intermittent breathing began to appear in Zhang's mouth and nose, and the arteries on his neck also began to beat again. Doctor Liang, seeing that Zhang had a chance of revival, worked even harder with more confidence. He found that the patient could only exhale and had difficulty inhaling, so he immediately changed to a breathing method of exchanging air, using his own mouth to catch the air exhaled by the patient and then blowing it into the patient's nostrils. Repeating this cycle, Zhang gradually began to make low humming sounds. Doctor Liang further drew 100 cc of blood from his own shoulder, plus 100 cc donated by orderly Dong Xixue and two others, and injected it all into Zhang. At this time, Doctor Liang was so exhausted that he could hardly stand it, but he still cheered up and continued to perform various rescue operations. Finally, Zhang gradually opened his tired and weak eyes, opened his lips to speak, and completely woke up. Under Doctor Liang's continued guidance and care, Zhang can now not only eat, but also has a rosy glow on his pale cheeks, and can talk to the orderlies about his stories of fighting the enemy on the front lines. In past battles, Comrade Liang Jianping has consistently shown a high degree of class solidarity, taking the lead in donating blood for severely wounded soldiers to ensure the success of the operation. In the battles of Liaoyang, Anshan, Xingcheng, and Jinzhou in Northeast China, he successively donated 750 cc of blood for wounded soldiers, directly promoting the "blood donation movement" in the Northeast health departments. During the Jinzhou blockade, he was extremely careful and responsible in treating wounded soldiers, resting only four or five hours a day. Once, he worked intensely for five hours, saving a comrade who was about to die. This spirit of service and work performance earned him a medal.

  　救人忘我起死回生
    【新华社平津前线廿一日电】曾经荣获朱德奖章的东北野战军某部军医梁建平同志，以高度负责与救人忘我的工作精神，使重伤员张振春排长起死回生，再度创造人民军队医务人员的工作范例。张排长在火线上腹部中弹重伤，运抵医院时虽经卫生部彭部长施行手术，取出肠中弹片，但因流血过多，由手术室移至病室后，脉搏就停止跳动了。当烈士埋葬委员会已开始给张排长准备后事的时候，梁建平同志赶来实行周密检查，结果证实张排长确已完全停止呼吸，四肢冰凉，肌肉开始僵化，仅躯干部稍有体温。梁医生想起了曾在苏联医学书上看到的：“人僵后三分钟到五分钟，大脑的细胞仍然活着，如能迅速急救，还有希望。”这几句话。于是立即给张排长注射二西西强心剂，并实行人工呼吸法，继续施行半小时后，再注射强心剂，并从鼻孔滴入三西西，同时在患者头部高度敷热。梁同志本已连续数昼夜未休息，在施行紧张的人工呼吸动作时，汗珠如雨直往下滴。如此进行到第三个小时后，张排长的口鼻里开始出现微弱的间歇的呼吸，颈项上的动脉也重新跳动了。梁医生看到张排长已有复活的可能，乃更有信心地加紧工作，他发现患者只能向外呼气，吸气困难，立即改用换养气的呼吸法，用自己的嘴接住患者呼出的气，再从患者鼻孔吹入，这样循环不息，渐渐地，张排长就能发出低微的哼哼声了。梁医生更进一步地从自己肩膀上抽血一百西西，加上看护员董喜学同志等二人献出的一百西西，一起注射到张排长身上。此时，梁医生已疲乏得难以支持，但他仍振作精神，继续施行各种救治手术，终于张排长渐渐地睁开了疲倦无力的眼睛，张开嘴唇想说话，完全苏醒过来了。在梁医生继续指导调护之下，现在张排长不仅能吃饭，而且发白的脸颊上初显红润，并能向看护员们谈说自己在前方杀敌的故事了。梁建平同志在过去历次战役中，一贯以高度的阶级友爱精神，争先为重伤员输血，以保证手术的成功。在东北辽阳、鞍山、兴城、锦州诸战役中，他曾先后为伤员输血七百五十西西，直接推动了东北卫生部门的“献血运动”。在锦州阻击战中，他极度细心负责诊疗伤员，每天只休息四五小时，有一次，他紧张地工作了五个钟头，救活了一个快要断气的同志。此种服务精神与工作成绩，使他荣获奖章。
