　　Dongyangpo Village Workers' Cooperative Iron Furnace
  　Starting from Scratch and Growing from Small to Large
    [Yangquan News] The iron furnace industry in Yangquan is mostly cooperatively run by workers. The Chuanguo Iron Furnace in Dongyangpo, Fourth District, was started in July 1948. At that time, workers Yang Da and Yu Xigui initiated it, gathering twelve workers who contributed twelve labor shares. The village cooperative lent them raw materials worth 1.7 *shi* of rice. They also sold 200 *tuo* of empty goods (each *tuo* weighing 17 *jin*, worth 27 *jin* of rice) to the public-owned store, obtaining a total of 3,400 *jin* of rice. Besides contributing labor, they did not contribute any capital themselves.
    As soon as they started, the twelve workers who contributed labor shares held a meeting and resolved: to grit their teeth and overcome difficulties, not to withdraw any money during the two *zhang lu* periods (each *zhang lu* lasting twenty days), to repay the cooperative for the raw material rice, deliver the sold empty goods, and lay a long-term production foundation within these two *zhang lu*. For more than forty days, they ate old pumpkins, yams, beans, and gruel. No matter how difficult it was, they did not withdraw a penny or take anything from the furnace. Yang Da, the leader, had nothing to eat at home, so he picked some beans and unripe old pumpkins from the field to eat, without asking the furnace for half a *sheng* of rice. When the goods from the two *zhang lu* were produced, their plan succeeded. In addition to repaying debts and delivering goods, they also stored some raw materials and distributed a share of dividends to each person. However, the furnace's capital was still insufficient. To solve this second difficulty, they came up with a new method: in addition to the labor share, each person would contribute two large *dou* of their distributed dividends as capital stock, becoming both workers and capital shareholders. In this way, from the second *zhang lu* to the seventh *zhang lu*, they accumulated a total of 12.8 *shi* of rice in capital, stored 270 *tuo* of coal (donkey loads, each *tuo* weighing over 150 *jin*), and various raw materials such as gangue, ash, and hemp worth 4.7 *shi* of rice, laying a long-term production foundation. Now, the accounts for the eighth *zhang lu* have not yet been settled. The workers said, "Once the eighth *zhang lu* is settled and wages are paid, we will have a comfortable New Year." Under these circumstances of starting from scratch, the workers' morale is particularly high. They have the confidence to participate in completing the government's 1949 call to increase the city's iron production by × tons.
    The reason this furnace was able to develop from nothing to something is not only because the workers have a spirit of hard work in production, but also because they implemented a democratic management system. Issues such as the furnace's production plan, buying raw materials, selling goods, and wages are all discussed democratically by everyone (beforehand, manager Yu Xigui proposes preliminary opinions, and everyone discusses and agrees or modifies them). Everyone consciously abides by the decisions made through discussion. For example, regarding the wage issue, everyone discussed and decided not to withdraw money before settling accounts, so everyone consciously refrained from withdrawing. When settling accounts, all expenses are made public, and everyone discusses which expenses are reasonable and which are unreasonable, and how to save on unreasonable expenses in the future. When working, everyone discusses how much raw material to use and how much goods to produce. At the time of inspection, if anyone produces less, the reasons are investigated. If the reduced output is caused by irresponsibility, criticism will be given. Because everyone in this furnace has shares, the workers are particularly concerned about the furnace's affairs. Every day after work, everyone automatically gathers together to discuss the day's work. They discuss which furnace produced more goods and which produced less, and learn from the experience. They focus on the benefits to production when teaching apprentices, and can cultivate apprentices from a production technology perspective, unlike the general old master-apprentice relationship, so the apprentices' production enthusiasm is very high. In addition, they also have a reward system. When settling accounts for the seventh *zhang lu*, seven people received awards. Under the management system of democratic combination and reward methods, everyone can work hard "shoulder to shoulder," and no one is willing to fall behind. Therefore, their output is one-third more than other furnaces. Generally, each furnace produces 15 *tuo* of goods per *lu*, while they produce 21 *tuo* per *lu*, and the quality is also stronger.

　　东杨坡村工人合作铁炉
  　白手起家从小到大
    【阳泉讯】阳泉的铁炉业，大部是工人合作经营。四区东杨坡的工人合作川锅炉，是一九四八年七月干起来的。当时由工人杨达、余喜贵发起，召集了十二个工人，集合了十二个人力股，资金由村合作社借给一石七斗米的原料；又卖给公营商店空货二百驮（每驮十七斤重，值二十七斤米），共得三千四百斤米。他们本身除了出劳力以外，资金一点没往外拿。
    刚一干起来，十二个入人力股的工人即开会决议：要咬着牙渡过难关，两帐炉的期间（每帐炉二十天）不许往外支钱，要在这两帐炉里，把欠合作社的原料米还清，卖下的空货交清，还要打下长期的生产基础。四十多天里，他们吃的是老窝瓜、山药、豆角和糊糊，再困难也不从炉上支一点钱、拿一点东西。把头杨达家里没吃的，到地里摘些豆角和没长好的老窝瓜吃，也不由炉上支半升米。两帐炉的货出齐了，他们的计划成功了。除还帐交货外，还存了一部原料，每人分了一部红利。但炉的资金还不够。为了解决这第二步困难，他们又想了新办法：每人除了劳力股外，还要把分的红利拿出二大斗，作为资金入股。又是工人又是资金股东。这样从第二帐炉起到第七帐炉止，共计积累了资金十二大石八斗米，存煤二百七十驮（毛驴驮子，每一驮子一百五十斤以上），矸、灰、麻各种原料值米四大石七斗，打下了长期生产的基础。现在第八帐炉还没算帐，工人们说：“第八帐炉算了，把工资开了，过个舒心年”，在这种白手起家的情况下，工人们情绪特别高。他们有信心参加完成一九四九年政府号召全市增产×万吨铁货的计划。
    这个炉能从无到有地发展起来，除了工人们有艰苦奋斗的生产精神外，主要原因是他们实行了民主管理制度；炉上的生产计划、买原料、卖货、工资等问题，都是经过大家民主讨论（事前由经理余喜贵提出准备意见，大家讨论同意或修改）；讨论决定的事，大家自觉遵守。比如关于工资问题，经大家讨论不许在不算帐时支钱，大家就自觉地谁也不支。到算帐时，一切开支公开，大家讨论那个开支合理，那个不合理，不合理的开支以后怎样节省。在做活时，大家讨论用多少原料，出多少货，到时检查谁出少了，就要追究原因，如因不负责任造成少出货，就要受到批评。由于这个炉每个人都有股，工人们都特别关心炉上的事，每天一下工，大家就自动聚在一起，咯吵一天的工作。讨论那个炉出的货多，那个炉出的货少，从中找出经验。对教徒弟，他们是从生产有利上着眼，能从生产技术上培养学徒，不象一般旧的师徒关系，所以学徒生产情绪很好。此外他们还定有奖励制度，在第七帐炉结帐时，有七个得奖的。在这样民主结合奖励办法的经营管理制度之下，大家都能“膀靠膀”地努力干，谁也不甘落后。所以，他们出的货比别炉多三分之一，一般炉每炉出货十五驮，他们一炉出到二十一驮，而且质量还强。
