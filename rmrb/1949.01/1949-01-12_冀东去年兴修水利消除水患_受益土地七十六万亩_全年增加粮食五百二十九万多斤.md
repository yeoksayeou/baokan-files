　　Benefiting 760,000 Mu of Land
　　Total Grain Increase for the Year Exceeded 5.29 Million Jin
　　Steps: Restore First, Then Develop; Methods: Extensive Publicity, Select Typical Examples

　　[Jidong Electric] The Jidong Administrative Office convened a water conservancy symposium on December 11th of last year. The symposium studied and discussed the issue of carrying out water conservancy projects and eliminating flooding. Attending were cadres and technical personnel from the 13th, 14th, and 15th Special Districts, and 8 counties, who had experience in water conservancy work, along with more than 20 people from the Administrative Office. It lasted eight days. First, it was pointed out that, thanks to the efforts of cadres at all levels and the masses, Jidong's water conservancy work had achieved considerable success over the past year. For example, Yu Tian's combination of water drainage and irrigation released and irrigated more than 210,000 mu of land, laying the foundation for this year's production. In Lu Nan and the 15th Special District, water conservancy construction such as building embankments, blocking breaches, diverting water for irrigation, sinking wells for wheat planting, and preventing floods, won the support of the broad masses. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Special Districts, a total of 775,917 laborers were mobilized to complete: (1) The drainage of the Taihe, Lin Nancang, and Sihui waterlogged depressions in Yu Tian County, and the Xiaojia River depression in Luan Nan County, releasing 126,427 mu of land. Bao Di released the water from the Ji Lian River to silt the land (Note: releasing river water to irrigate fields, the yellow mud in the water silts the ground, making the land fertile) 4,540 mu. (2) In Xiang He, Ji Xian, Bao Di, Ning He, Yu Tian, and Luan Nan, a total of 15 rivers, canals, and ditches were dug, opened, and cleared, with a length of 24,470 zhang, and in Yu Tian, Wu Qing, and Feng Run, 109,762 mu of land were irrigated by digging wells and diverting water. (3) The breaches in Luan Nan, Bao Di, Ji Xian and other places were dammed and blocked, benefiting a total of 457,260 mu of land. Embankments were built along the Ji Lian River, Jian Gan River, Huan Xiang River, Zhou River, Gou River, and other rivers. In Luan Nan County alone, 23,331 zhang of embankments were built, benefiting 30,000 mu of land. The above projects benefited a total of 767,119 mu of land. The annual grain production increased by 5,296,980 jin, and losses were reduced by 386,000 jin. It is estimated that this year's production can increase by 33,877,360 jin.

　　The meeting continued to review that in the past, Jidong was in a wartime guerrilla environment, and water conservancy work was generally carried out in a free-flowing state. The leadership did not pay enough attention to water conservancy work and lacked unified leadership and careful planning, often causing unnecessary losses. For example, at the same time as the damming work at Ma Yingkou on the Ji Lian River in Bao Di last year, Shao Zhuangzi in Ji Xian, upstream on the opposite bank of the river, opened up to drain the depression, resulting in the closure of the Ma Yingkou embankment three times, and the Shao Zhuangzi blockage of the depression mouth three times, causing mutual losses and particularly increasing the difficulty of damming and draining. Some projects did not consider objective conditions and relied on subjective imagination, resulting in wasted manpower and financial resources, and were opposed by the masses. For example, the blocking of the "Huan Xiang River" in Niu Gezhuang, Yu Tian, to divert water for irrigation, did not consult with the masses well, resulting in a loss of 5,760 jin of millet and the consumption of 2,960 laborers, and the drainage also failed.

　　According to reports from various special districts and counties, the people of Jidong urgently need to carry out water conservancy projects and prevent floods. For example, when the leaders of the Fourth District of Yu Tian issued a call, the masses of Qianjiagou immediately responded, blocking the river and diverting water to irrigate more than 4,000 mu of land. The masses of Ning He said: "As long as we dig rivers and open canals to turn barren saline land into paddy fields, we are willing to give up five mu out of ten." Projects such as building dikes, preventing risks, and clearing canals in various waterlogged areas often involved tens of thousands of people, and the masses were able to actively complete them. Last year, the masses in Yu Tian and Ji Xian even broke the habit of repairing dikes in the spring and prepared for this year's "annual repairs" during the slack farming season in the autumn.

　　The meeting, based on the fact that the war in the Jidong area is about to end and it is entering a long-term peaceful construction environment, determined that the guiding principle for water conservancy work should be: "Long-term construction, actively carrying out water conservancy projects and preventing floods." In terms of work steps, the current main task is to restore existing construction. Due to the limitations of manpower and financial resources, large-scale projects cannot be carried out immediately. Attention should be paid to the principles of "easy and simple," "within our capabilities," and "restore first, then develop." All larger projects should be surveyed, planned, and reported to the Administrative Office and higher authorities for approval, and the phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline should be opposed. In terms of working methods, we should strive to combine with reality, maintain close contact with the masses, and combine leadership with the masses. Currently, we should widely publicize water conservancy projects, but we must have a plan to select typical examples and organize their implementation so that they can have a greater impact and be promoted. Water conservancy committees at all levels should establish close contact, exchange experiences, and report situations in order to coordinate and cooperate in handling various water conservancy tasks that are mutually related. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Special Districts and counties present at the meeting formulated specific plans for water conservancy work based on local conditions. Chang Li and Ning He will open four canals with a total length of 3,540 zhang. In Ren Fengzhuang, Ning He, 19 villages will restore 100 horsepower machines and 150 horse-drawn waterwheels, restoring and developing 18,000 mu of paddy fields. Clear one sluice gate at Shao Zhuangzi in Ji Xian. Build and repair embankments along the Ji Lian River, Lan Quan River, Rong Hui River, Qing Long River, Su River, Gou River and other rivers, with a length of 62,543 zhang. The above projects require more than 472,900 laborers, benefit more than 691,700 mu of land, and are estimated to increase grain production by 8,525,000 jin.

　　冀东去年兴修水利消除水患
  　受益土地七十六万亩
  　全年增加粮食五百二十九万多斤
  　步骤：先恢复后开辟方法：多宣传选典型
    【冀东电】冀东行政公署于去年十二月十一日召开水利座谈会。座谈研究兴修水利、消除水患问题。到会有十三、十四、十五三个专区八个县的专县区村具有水利工作经验的干部与技术人员，连同行署机关参加的人员共二十余名，历时八天结束。首先指出冀东一年来的水利工作在各级干部及群众努力下，获得了相当成绩。如玉田各崖泄水与浇地相结合，脱出与灌溉土地二十一万余亩，扩大耕地面积打下今年生产基础。路南及十五分区，搭埝堵口引水浇地打井种麦防除水患等水利建设，获得广大群众的拥护，据十三、十四、十五分区八个县不完全统计，共动员民工七十七万五千九百十七个，完成（一）玉田县太和、林南仓、四会三个积水洼和滦南县肖家河水洼泄水，脱出土地十二万六千四百二十七亩，宝坻放蓟莲河水淤地（注：放河水灌田、水中黄泥淤积地面，使土地肥沃）四千五百四十亩。（二）香河、蓟县、宝坻、宁河、玉田、滦南，共挖河、开渠、清理渠十五道，长二万四千四百七十丈之玉田、武清、丰润，挖井、引水浇地十万九千七百六十二亩。（三）搭堵滦南、宝坻、蓟县等地决口，共受益土地四十五万七千二百六十亩。搭蓟莲河、箭杆河、还乡河、周河、沟河等河堤。只滦南一县即搭埝二万三千三百三十一丈，受益土地三万亩。以上工程共受益土地七十六万七千一百十九亩。当年增产粮食五百二十九万六千九百八十斤，减少损失三十八万六千斤，估计今年可增产三千三百八十七万七千三百六十斤。
    会议继续检讨过去冀东处于战争游击环境，水利工作一般的是在自流状态下进行，领导上对水利工作也不够重视，缺乏统一领导与周密计划，往往造成不必要的损失。如与去年蓟莲河宝坻马营堵口工作同时，该河上游对岸蓟县邵庄子开沽泄水，结果马营口合垄三次，邵庄子堵沽口亦三次，双方互有损失，特别增加了堵口与泄水的困难。有的工程不顾客观条件，凭主观想象，结果劳民伤财，遭到群众反对。如玉田牛各庄堵“还乡河”泄水浇地，没有和群众很好商量，结果损失经费小米五千七百六十斤，消耗人工二千九百六十个，泄水也告失败。
    据各专县报告，冀东人民迫切需要兴修水利、防备水患工作，如玉田四区领导上一号召，钱家沟群众即起而响应，堵河引水浇地四千余亩，宁河群众说：“只要挖河开渠，把不毛咸地变为稻田，十亩地剩五亩也愿意。”各水洼地区修堤、防险、清渠等工程，动辄以数万计，群众都能积极完成。去年玉田蓟县群众竟破除向来春季修堤习惯，在秋后农闲时间，作好今年的“岁修”。
    会议根据冀东区战争即将过去，要进入长期和平建设环境，确定水利工作应是：“长期建设，积极地兴修水利与防除水患”方针。工作步骤上，当前主要是恢复旧有建设，因受人力财力限制，还不能马上举办巨大的计划，要注意“轻而易举”、“力所能及”、“先恢复后开辟”的原则，一切工程较大的，应经过勘验，有计划，并须呈报行署及上级机关批准，反对无组织无纪律现象。在工作方法上，力求结合实际、保持与群众密切联系，作到领导与群众相结合，当前要广泛宣传兴修水利，但须有计划的选择典型，组织实现，以便能起更大影响推广作用。各级水利委员会应取得密切联系，交流经验，反映情况，以便协同配合办理各种互相有关系的水利工作。到会十三、十四、十五各专县，根据当地情况制造水利工作具体计划。昌黎、宁河开渠四道，共长三千五百四十丈。宁河任风庄十九村，恢复马力机一百架，马拉水车一百五十架，恢复与开展稻田一万八千亩。清蓟县邵庄子闸口一道。搭补蓟莲河、兰泉河、荣辉河、青龙河、诉河、沟河等河堤，长六万二千五百四十三丈。以上工程需工四十七万二千九百余个，受益土地六十九万一千七百余亩，估计可增产粮食八百五十二万五千斤。
