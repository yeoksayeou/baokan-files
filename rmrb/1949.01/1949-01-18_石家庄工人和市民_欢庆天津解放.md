　　Shijiazhuang Workers and Citizens
  　Celebrate the Liberation of Tianjin
    [Our News] The news of the liberation of Tianjin was immediately transmitted to Shijiazhuang City by the Tianjin Xinhua Broadcasting Station. When the news was spread to the ears of every citizen through telephones, the People's Education Center broadcasting station, rooftop broadcasts, etc., the people of Shijiazhuang cheered: workers and students, in order to celebrate the victory of the liberation of Tianjin, spontaneously organized Yangko dance teams and propaganda teams, and danced Yangko to the sound of gongs and drums on the wide Chaoyang and Xinhua roads. When the workers of the Shijiazhuang Electric Light Company heard that Tianjin had been liberated, a worker in the boiler room jumped up happily. He held a shovel and hit a piece of coal, saying, "That's great, the liberation of Tianjin has solved a lot of our difficulties." The line workers installed electric lights on the four large characters of "Liberation of Tianjin," and everyone sang and danced Yangko there.
    The workers of the coking plant were rehearsing a new play to celebrate the Spring Festival when suddenly, the call sign of the Tianjin Xinhua Broadcasting Station came from the radio. People were very surprised, and then it broadcast: "The People's Liberation Army completely occupied Tianjin, the largest industrial city in North China, at 1:30 pm today..." This made people excited. They clapped and cheered. The actors disregarded rehearsing the play, and those who carried drums, those who took gongs, those who sang, and those who shouted all crowded into the yard and spontaneously danced Yangko and set off for the streets. They cheered as much as they could and danced as much as they could. They were not just dancing Yangko, they were completely jumping the Yangko dance.
    Propaganda trucks and Yangko teams successively emerged from Xinhua Road. People were tearing their throats and shouting slogans such as "Celebrate the liberation of Tianjin! Attack Beiping and capture Fu Zuoyi alive..." which alarmed the hearts of everyone. Even those shops that had closed their doors relit their electric lights to inquire about the victory news. On Xinhua Road, a businessman-like person said, "With the liberation of Tianjin, business will be easier to do in the future."
    The audience in cinemas and theaters applauded in unison when they heard the news of the victory of the liberation of Tianjin. Until late at night, there were still sounds of gongs and drums of Yangko dance and people's cheers from afar.

　　石家庄工人和市民
  　欢庆天津解放
    【本报讯】解放天津的消息，立刻由天津新华广播台传播到石家庄市。消息由电话、民教馆广播台、屋顶广播等，传播到每个市民的耳朵里去时，石市人民欢呼起来了：工人们、学生们，为庆祝解放天津的胜利，都自动的组织了秧歌队、宣传队，从朝阳、新华等宽大的马路上，锣鼓喧天的扭起了秧歌舞。石市电灯公司的工人们听说天津解放了，锅炉房的一个工友高兴的跳了起来，他拿着铁锹打着煤块说：“可好啦，天津这一解放，解决了咱们好多困难”。线路工人把电灯安在天津解放的四个大字上，大家就在那里又唱又扭起秧歌来。
    炼焦厂的工人们，正在为庆祝春节排演新剧，忽然，从收音机里传出天津新华广播电台的呼号，人们都很惊奇，接着就播送出：“人民解放军今日下午一时半完全占领华北最大的工业城市天津……。”这一下，使的人们就乱起来了，他们鼓掌，欢呼。演员们不顾排演剧了，搬鼓的、拿锣的、唱的、叫的，都拥挤到院子里，自动的扭起秧歌，出发街头了。他们尽情的用尽力量欢呼一阵，扭一阵，他们不是在扭秧歌，完全是跳秧歌舞了。
    从新华路上相继涌现出宣传卡车和秧歌队，人们都扯破了嗓子高呼着“庆祝天津解放！打到北平去，活捉傅作义……”等口号，惊动了每个人们的心。连那些已关上门的商店，也重新把电灯扭亮，来探听胜利的消息。在新华路，一个商人模样的人说：“天津解放了，以后生意更好做了。”
    电影院、戏院的观众，听到解放天津的胜利消息，都不约而同的鼓起掌来。直到深夜，仍有由远处传来扭秧歌的锣鼓声和人们的欢呼声。
