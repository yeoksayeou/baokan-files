　　Government Loans Combined with Private Capital
  　Harmony County Farmers Buy Livestock in Large Numbers
  　Five Livestock Stations Established County-Wide to Breed Draught Animals
    [Taihang News] In Harmony County, villages that have correctly completed land reform are seeing farmers purchase livestock in large numbers, preparing for large-scale production. During the Anti-Japanese War, Harmony County suffered immense damage and looting by the enemy and puppet regime, resulting in a drastic reduction of livestock. Before the war, the county had 7,105 head of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses, but now there are only 2,949. The county leadership has made breeding and increasing livestock one of the main issues in Harmony's three-year production and construction plan. In winter production, the plan is to support the masses in increasing the number of donkeys by 200. The county will first support the masses in establishing a livestock farm, creating a herd of cattle, specializing in raising cows to breed draught animals. Five livestock stations will be established to support the masses in raising male donkeys and male horses, breeding with the masses' female donkeys and female horses to propagate livestock. Because Harmony's donkeys do not pay attention to breeds and the cattle and donkeys are very small, the Harmony People's Bank has specifically provided loans of 30 million Jichaos to support the masses in buying donkeys, 15 million to support the livestock farm in establishing a cattle herd, and 4 million to support the masses in raising livestock breeds. It was also decided that the key villages to support for buying donkeys would be those that: 1. Have transportation conditions; 2. Have a lot of land but lack animal power; 3. Urgently need support in winter production and can repay the loan by profiting from transportation sidelines. Thus, it was determined that six villages in the first district, including Baiquan, Caijiazhuang, Xingcun, Gaojiazhuang, Huyukou, and Yangjiayu, would be supported to buy 90 donkeys, 80 in Liyang, Boli, and Wenyuan in the second district, and 30 in Jingshang, Sitou, and Mafang in the sixth district. A livestock farm was established in Lezezhang Village, and five livestock stations were established in Chengguan in the first district, Songyan in the third district, Dachuankou in the fourth district, Shangbaiyan in the fifth district, and Shangbeishe in the seventh district.
    On October 30th, the county branch bank took out 20 million in loans, and the county cooperative took out 10 million in funds, sending people from the county cooperative to buy 106 donkeys in the Hequ County and Xunzhen area of northwestern Shanxi. The first batch of 65 arrived back on December 15th. The next day happened to be market day, and the masses in the key villages received the news and rushed to the city to buy them, selling them all out in two days. The second batch of 40 arrived on the 20th and were sold out in one day. When buying livestock, many people from non-key villages also scrambled to buy, asking the government to designate their village as a key village. Many villagers flocked to the People's Bank, requesting loans, and some went to the County Cooperative, requesting to buy livestock. At the County Cooperative's representative meeting, the representatives resolved not to distribute dividends but to ask the county to buy livestock, allowing members to buy them first. They said: Buying livestock is better than distributing dividends. At the request of the masses, the County Cooperative sent people with 23 million on the 22nd to northwestern Shanxi to buy more livestock. The county branch bank also responded to five well-producing villages by providing loans of 33.5 million (at an interest rate of 1%) through the village cooperatives, absorbing 38.05 million from floating capital from the masses, totaling 71.51 million, which could buy 240 livestock. They have already taken out the loans on the 24th and 25th to purchase. The masses in Jingshang, Sitou, and Mafang, key villages in the sixth district, were anxious because they were far from the city and did not get to buy, saying, "Why didn't the county tell us to prepare the funds to buy when they bought livestock?" Therefore, bank cadres worked with district cadres to organize. Currently, more than 3 million in floating capital has been organized. The branch bank, in order to take care of areas with fewer livestock (the entire sixth district has 25 donkeys), has provided more than 5 million in donkey loans and is preparing to depart to buy. At present, Songyan and Shinan villages in the third district, as well as many individuals, are requesting loans in their own names to combine their own money to buy livestock. The branch bank explained that the bank's resources are limited and cannot take care of everyone, but will focus on supporting key areas, supporting a batch of villages before supporting another. In Lezezhang Village in the sixth district, 73 households have 38 households voluntarily combining private capital and loans to buy cattle (the village is a livestock area), with 84 cattle and one donkey. It was calculated that there is a total of 3.05 million in private capital, with 6 million in bank loans, totaling 9.05 million, with plans to buy 40 good cows (the county plans to develop 100 cows in this area). They are preparing to go to the Xishan area of Taiyuan to buy good cattle, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high.
    Through the organization of county and district cadres, five livestock stations have been established, and the people raising livestock breeds are in high spirits. It is estimated that the five families have a total of 1.21 million in private capital, with the government providing loans of 3.06 million, planning to buy seven livestock breeds. Two male donkeys have already been purchased, and others are being sought. Someone has already gone to Baotou. After the county government cooperative section and the branch bank prepare to buy all the livestock breeds, a technical personnel symposium will be held next month to exchange breeding experience and lay the foundation for this year's breeding. It is now calculated that by the end of the lunar year, excluding the livestock purchased by the masses with their own funds, with the support of government loans, the actual increase will be 426 donkeys, 40 cows, and 7 livestock breeds.
    The reason why the masses in Harmony County are now vigorously buying livestock is mainly because, after policy education, the masses' minds are stable, and their enthusiasm for production has increased, and all classes have the desire to become rich. Especially in villages that have completed land reform, the masses' enthusiasm is particularly high. Second, Harmony County is a hemp-producing area, producing millions of pounds of hemp each year. This winter, hemp skin is more valuable, at around 3,000 Jiao per pound, and the masses have some surplus. The third is the county government loan. (Defu, Yingzhi)

　　政府贷款与私资结合
  　和顺农民大买牲口
  　全县已成立五个畜种站繁殖耕畜
    【太行讯】和顺县正确结束了土地改革的村庄，农民正大量购买牲口，准备大生产。和顺在抗日战争中，由于敌伪摧残抢劫，牲口减少的太多了。抗战前全县有牛驴骡马七千一百零五头，现在只有二千九百四十九头。县领导上就把繁殖、增加牲口做为和顺三年生产建设计划的主要问题之一。冬季生产中，计划扶植群众增加毛驴二百头。县里先扶植群众建立一个牧畜场，建立牛群，专养母牛，繁殖耕畜。建立五个畜种站，扶植群众养公驴公马，给群众的母驴母马交配，以繁殖牲畜。因和顺毛驴不注意畜种，牛驴体格很小，和顺人民支行又专门以三千万冀钞的贷款扶植群众买驴，以一千五百万元扶植牧畜场建立牛群，以四百万元扶植群众养畜种。并决定扶植买驴重点村条件是：一、有运输条件的；二、土地多，缺少畜力的；，三、冬季生产急需扶植，并能在运输副业获利下归还的。这样确定了一区白泉、蔡家庄、邢村、郜家庄、虎峪口、杨家峪等六个村扶植买驴九十头，二区李阳、泊里、温源八十头，六区京上、寺头、马坊三个村卅头。在了则掌村建立牧畜场，在一区城关、三区松烟、四区大川口、五区上白岩、七区上北舍建立五个畜种站。
    十月三十日，县支行拿出贷款二千万元，县联社拿出资金一千万元，由县社派人到晋西北河曲县巡镇一带买毛驴一百零六头，第一批六十五头，于十二月十五日赶回来，第二天正碰赶集，重点村的群众都得到消息，跑来城里购买，两天卖个干净。第二批四十头，二十日回来，一天便卖完了。买牲口时，好多非重点村群众也都抢着要买，要求政府把自己村定成重点村。有许多村的群众都纷纷拥到人民支行里要求贷款，有的到县联社要求买牲口。县社开社员代表大会时，代表们决议不分红，要求县里买牲口，买回来先尽社员买。他们说：买牲口比分红强。在群众要求下，县社又派人于二十二号带款二千三百万到晋西北去买，县支行又答复了五个生产好的村通过村合作社贷款三千三百五十万元（利息一分），吸收群众游资三千八百零五万元，共计七千一百五十一万元，能买牲口二百四十头。已于二十四五日先后带款出去购买。六区重点村京上、寺头、马坊群众因为离城远，没有赶上买，急的说：“为啥县里买回牲口不告说咱准备下款子去买？”因之银行干部就协同区干部前往组织。现已组织游资三百多万。支行为了照顾那里牲口少（全六区有二十五头毛驴），已贷给毛驴贷款五百余万元，正准备出发去买。刻下还有三区的松烟、石南等村以及不少人要以个人名义要求贷款，结合自己的钱买牲口，支行就给他们解释银行力量有限，不能全盘照顾，是分开重点照顾，扶植了一批村再扶植一批村。六区了则掌村，七十三户人家，就有三十八户自愿结合私资，贷款买牛（该村是牧畜地区），现有牛八十四只，驴一头。计算了一下，共有私资三百零五万元，银行贷给款六百万元，共计九百零五万元，计划可买好母牛四十只（县计划在此地发展牛百只）他们正准备到太原西山一带买好牛，群众劲头非常大。
    经过县区干部的组织，五个畜种站建立起来了，养畜种的人情绪很高。计五家私资共有一百二十一万元，政府贷给三百零六万元，计划买七个牲畜种，现在已买到两个公驴，其他正在物色。有人已到包头去了。县政府合作科和支行准备买齐畜种后，上月份召开个技术人员座谈会，交流配种经验，打下今年配种基础。现在计算，到阴历年底，除群众自集资金买牲口不计外，在政府贷款扶植下，可实际增加驴四百二十六头，母牛四十只，畜种七只。
    和顺群众现在大力购买牲口的原因，主要是经过政策教育，群众思想安定，生产情绪提高，各阶层都有了发家致富的要求。尤其结束了土改的村，群众劲头特别大。第二，和顺是个产麻地区，每年产麻百万斤，今冬麻皮较值钱，每斤冀钞三千元左右，群众有部分富余。第三是县府贷款。（德甫、英智）
