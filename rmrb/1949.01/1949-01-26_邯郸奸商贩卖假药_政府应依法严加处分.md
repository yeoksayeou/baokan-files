　　Hantan profiteers sell fake medicine
   The government should severely punish them according to law
    [Special Dispatch] A large number of fake medicines were found in Handan City, and the government confiscated them with a responsible attitude towards the lives of the people. There are more than 80 pharmacies in the city, and those selling fake medicines account for as many as 60; 55 kinds of fake medicines have been found, with a total value of 15.96 million yuan (Ji currency) (including 22 kinds of Chinese medicine, 20 kinds of pills and powders, and 13 kinds of Western medicine). The medicinal properties of the substitutes are completely opposite. For example, Astragalus, which originally tastes sweet and is used to replenish vitality, but the fake substitute tastes bitter and is cool in nature. If it is used by a patient, it may harm or even kill the person. The pills and powders are made of black bean flour mixed with medicinal dregs, mostly from the Anyang area occupied by the Chiang bandits. However, some are made locally or come from Anguo, and impersonate Shanghai trademarks. Western medicines are mostly outdated and ineffective. According to the initial discovery of fake medicines, it was at the pharmaceutical exhibition held in the city last November. Niuhuang Jiedu pills from Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory were sold. Someone asked what raw materials the pills were made of, but the seller couldn't answer, and finally admitted that it was fake medicine. The Industry and Commerce Bureau immediately gave a stern rebuke. Later, doctors in the city pointed out that most of the medicines sold in the city were fake medicines, and painfully described the fact that fake medicines killed people, requesting the government to thoroughly investigate. The municipal government immediately called on pharmacies to report fake medicines and formed a medical inspection team (including upright doctors, heads of state-owned pharmacies, and cadres from the Industry and Commerce Bureau) to conduct inspections door-to-door in five batches using methods such as oral testing and scientific testing. But at first, merchants such as Yufeng Pharmacy refused inspection under the pretext of protecting industry and commerce. They also threatened that "the reputation of fake medicine will spread and the market of pharmacies in the city will be depressed;" later, they requested leniency this time, guaranteeing that they would not sell it again after it was sold out, and some even suggested selling it to other counties or Chiang-occupied areas. The government immediately sternly refuted this. After the sale of fake medicines was prohibited, Tongji Pharmacy and Tianshunyu Medicine Shop still secretly sold them and have been fined. (Editor's note: Special attention should be paid to such unscrupulous medicine merchants who disregard the lives of the people, and they should be handed over to the government for legal processing.) Citizens and genuinely upright medicine merchants were very excited about this treatment, saying: "The government has done another good thing for the people." From then on, doctors dared to use medicine boldly. This is of great significance to the prosperity of Handan's pharmaceutical market.
    [Another Dispatch] In view of the widespread sale of fake medicines in the city, the Handan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce believes that attention should be paid to this issue and has put forward three suggestions to the North China People's Government: (1) Promulgate medical management regulations; (2) Establish a medical inspection organization and unify trademark registration; (3) Conduct medical inspection campaigns with emphasis, especially focusing on the pharmaceutical industry cleanup in Anguo City, because its distribution area is very large and it penetrates into rural areas.
