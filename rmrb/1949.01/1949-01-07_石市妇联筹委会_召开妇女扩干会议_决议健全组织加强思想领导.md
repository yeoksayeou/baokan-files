　　Shijiazhuang Women's Federation Preparatory Committee
  　Convenes Expanded Cadre Meeting of Women
  　Resolves to Improve Organization and Strengthen Ideological Leadership
    [Our Newspaper] The Shijiazhuang Women's Federation Preparatory Committee convened a meeting of the preparatory committee and an expanded cadre meeting of women in the city to review past work and determine the future direction: to unite and mobilize women from all walks of life in the city to participate in the construction of the city and strive to quickly defeat the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and establish a New Democratic China. Specific work begins with establishing and improving various women's mass organizations. Preparatory committees for district women's federations, women's issue research associations in female student bodies, and staff branches have been successively established. Currently, the federation is working with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to study the work of female workers, mainly to solve female workers' welfare and education issues, establish a new attitude towards labor, reasonably resolve wage issues in production, and gradually build worker welfare services. A representative meeting of female workers is now being held. Among female students, aiming at the current school situation, the federation is strengthening revolutionary education to overcome women's jealousy, narrow-mindedness, pettiness, and other issues, to enhance political awareness, actively study culture, and establish a world view of serving the people. Among poor citizens and workers' families, production and literacy classes are organized to cultivate their labor habits and production capacity, help solve livelihood problems, and enhance political awareness, gradually changing the status of women in the family and society. Among public and educational personnel, groups are organized, and branches are established to strengthen the unity and ideological leadership among female staff members, solve women's issues (ideological issues, welfare issues, etc.), so that they can improve work efficiency, ability, and technology in their respective departments.
