　　Preliminary Party Rectification in Jiangli Village: Process and Experience
    Taiyue Xinhua Branch
  　I. Historical Characteristics of the Jiangli Branch
    The Jiangli Branch was established during the War of Resistance Against Japan—in May 1944—and grew in strength during the anti-traitor liquidation (mass movement) and land reform, and other anti-feudal struggles. Among the thirty-two party members, there was one worker, one farmhand, twenty-three poor peasants, and seven middle peasants. There were no landlords or rich peasants (Qiu Shun's background may be that of a rich peasant, to be investigated); there were no vagrants.
    Generally speaking, the Jiangli Branch was tempered and tested during the War of Resistance Against Japan and in the anti-feudal struggles. In 1946, under the leadership and call of comrades such as Yang Guanding and Yang Fengxi, forty-seven young people enthusiastically joined the army in one go, including eleven party members. Last August, under the leadership of the branch, thirty-seven young people joined the army, including eight party members. The branch cultivated the famous militia "Night Pearl." Of the current thirty-two party members, seventeen are militiamen or have served as militiamen, four are veterans, seven are veterans of war service, seven are combat heroes, two are production models, one is a mutual aid model, and two have achieved merit upon merit. However, the party members of the branch, especially the leading cadres, carried the burden of being heroes, showing arrogance and complacency.
    The Jiangli Branch is basically united; however, their unity is mixed with some incorrect male-female relationships and kinship ties. They have done many things that infringe upon the interests of the people, seriously separating themselves from the masses, who call them "a bunch, a gang."
    II. The Situation of Party-Masses Relations in Jiangli and the Obstacles to Party Rectification
    Before the preliminary Party rectification, Jiangli had carried out a general correction of deviations in May and June of this year. Initially, when mobilizing the masses, some wrongly struggled households and some discontented elements, as well as individuals with ulterior motives, vented all kinds of grievances against the party members accumulated over the years, raising many opinions about the party members and exposing many behaviors that infringed upon the interests of the people, which the leadership had not discovered or had not paid attention to. To solve these problems, the leadership at the time urged party members to reflect and prepare to admit their mistakes to the masses.
    However, at that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants were not mobilized to consciously correct deviations, nor was the branch leadership mobilized to correct deviations and rectify the party. Instead, the branch was kicked aside to do the work. The party members were not mentally prepared, and the pressure from the masses came, mixed with some biased retaliatory behaviors, wanting to beat the cadres. This created sharp opposition between the party members and the masses, and between the party members and the leadership. All party members lay down and refused to work, saying, "Being a cadre is like being cursed for eight lifetimes!"
    Two months later, when the work team arrived at Jiangli Village on October 4th of this year, the above-mentioned opposition between the party members and the masses, and between the party members and the leadership, as well as the resulting negativity and pessimism, basically remained unchanged. The party members could not hold their heads up in front of the masses, no one listened to them, and all work came to a standstill. However, they did not understand that this was the inevitable result of their violation of the masses' interests and detachment from the masses in their work, and that they should examine themselves to improve the relationship between the party and the masses. On the contrary, they complained about the correction of deviations, saying, "After the deviations are corrected, the masses are democratic and free, and there is no way to work!" Therefore, they continued to adopt an attitude of opposition to the masses and took a passive or confrontational attitude towards Party rectification. Some party members planned: "Let's go to the west to do transportation after autumn!" Trying to avoid Party rectification.
    III. Conveying the Party Rectification Policy, Examining the Relationship Between the Party and the Masses, Arousing Vigilance, and Raising Awareness
    In order to change the attitude of opposition between party members and the masses and to make party members turn back to examine themselves and carry out criticism and self-criticism, the work team carried out patient work among the party members in the following two aspects.
    The first step was to talk individually and speak at meetings. The main content was: (1) Affirming that the branch has achievements, but also has shortcomings and mistakes, the relationship between the party and the masses is very bad, the party must be rectified, explaining the upper-level's determination to rectify the party, and criticizing the passive and evasive attitude towards Party rectification. (2) Conveying the Party rectification policy, focusing on conveying several principles in the Party rectification method, emphasizing the party members' conscious Party rectification, emphasizing the comprehensive history, and clarifying right and wrong, merits and demerits. (3) According to the ideological situation of the branch party members, explaining the standards of a communist party member, pointing out the future of the revolution, criticizing the negative and pessimistic, downhill thinking among the party members, and pointing out that the peasants used to follow the Communist Party to turn themselves over, and they would not be able to get rid of poverty without the Communist Party.
    The presentation of these issues began to inspire the solidified state of the party members' thinking for a long time. Some party members said: "After listening to the report, I feel that I am not like a Communist Party member, and I have the problems that others have mentioned." Some gradually felt that: lying down and doing nothing in the past was a loss, and the masses are getting farther and farther away from us. The general party members' understanding of Party rectification began to change, and the cold response to the work team also began to improve, and meetings were easier to convene. However, at this time, the party members had not yet realized the seriousness of the party's detachment from the masses. They did not realize that the masses' dissatisfaction with the party was the result of the party members infringing upon the masses' interests, and they did not realize that the first thing that should be examined in today's Party rectification is themselves.
    Therefore, in the second step, the work team called on focusing on examining the relationship between the party and the masses. The work team proposed: The relationship between the party and the masses in Jiangli is very bad. The branch secretary immediately said: "Those who are dissatisfied with the cadres are also a few households that were struggled against, and the general masses have nothing to say." Party member Xing Fukuan said: "Don't say nothing, I think more than half of the masses are detached!" Shi Derong said: "How many are detached? This is easy to handle. Let's count from the archway, one household at a time, and see how many households have no opinion." After counting like this, the problem came out: In addition to the twelve landlord and rich peasant households, there were a total of 298 peasant households in the village. The attitude towards the party members and cadres can be divided into three categories: those who raised opinions and actively opposed them totaled 162 households, accounting for 54.3% of all peasants. Eighty-five households did not express their attitude, accounting for 28.5% of the peasants. Fifty-one households supported the cadres, accounting for 17.1% of the peasants. The reasons for the opinions raised and actively opposed by the cadres were: (1) A total of 57 households were infringed upon due to certain errors in the implementation of policies and private retaliation in previous movements, accounting for 35% of the dissatisfied households (Editor's note: Private retaliation should not be calculated in this item, but should be calculated in item (3)). (2) A total of 44 households were dissatisfied due to cadres occupying more fruits and unfair handling in previous movements, accounting for 27%. (3) A total of 32 households were attacked due to cadres' rigid work style and personal prejudices, accounting for 19%. (4) A total of 16 households were not taken care of by cadres in the movement, or did not turn themselves over due to private opinions, accounting for 10%. (5) A total of 13 households were dissatisfied due to private disputes with cadres, accounting for 7%. The eighty-five households that did not express their attitude: most were old and easy-going people, young children who did not understand things, and women who did not care about things. The fifty-one households that supported the cadres: (1) 34 households were party members' own families or relatives. (2) 13 households were thoroughly turned over with special care from cadres in the movement. (3) A total of 6 households were wealthy middle peasants and old middle peasants who had never been harmed in previous movements. (Editor's note: Why are there two more households than the original number?)
    The result of this examination of the relationship between the party and the masses shocked the party members and widened their eyes. The branch secretary said: "Oh dear! Things are scary! No wonder the masses ignore us when they see us, it turns out they all have opinions." Xing Fukuan, the director of the cooperative, said: "I think if we don't rectify the party now, in another six months, the masses will treat us as Chiang Kai-shek!" Shi Derong said: "In the past, we only cared about production and didn't think about work. Now I think: if we lose the masses, what's the point of earning 30,000 or 20,000 taels!"
    Based on this awareness, the problems of why Yang Xiaodong's militia led by Yang Xiaodong during the War of Resistance Against Japan was opposed by the masses (irresponsible sentry duty, searching pockets)? Why the masses supported the militia led by the "Night Pearl" (party member) later (able to protect the masses, discipline is also better)? Why the masses wanted to reorganize the peasant association led by Liu Zhile (not representing the interests of the poor)? Why the masses supported the peasant association led by Yuan Zhizhong, etc., were reviewed. The party members discussed and recalled the facts they personally experienced, so that the party members realized that the Jiangli Branch was not detached from the masses from the beginning. In the previous stage of fighting the Japanese and liquidating traitors, the masses supported the party members. In this way, they realized that: the eyes of the masses are sharp, and they are reasonable. Whoever does good things will be supported, and whoever does bad things will be opposed. Whenever they are for the masses, the masses will support them; whenever they infringe on the masses, the masses will oppose them. By guiding the party members to understand the relationship between the party and the masses, guiding the party members to examine their work, examine themselves, and the movement of criticism and self-criticism, it unfolded step by step.
    IV. Deepening Work Inspection, Criticism and Self-Criticism Made the Movement Improve a Step
    With the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism, the attitude of each party member gradually became clear. In the later stage of work inspection, the branch party members can be roughly divided into three types: The first type, such as comrades Liu Xuegeng and others, can actively and proactively expose problems. They are upright, have few or minor mistakes, and have a high level of awareness. The masses have no or few opinions about them in the correction of deviations. They can reflect the thoughts and emotions of the masses and represent the demands of the masses. The second type, such as Yuan Cunchu (branch secretary), Xu Yuxuan (branch propaganda, chairman of the peasant association), Yang Xiaolin (secretary of the women's association), and the twenty-third comrade, they themselves did not make big mistakes, and did not conceal their mistakes. However, they are unwilling to expose and pursue the mistakes of other comrades, which is essentially sectarian sentiment. The third type, the village chief, deputy branch secretary, and other four comrades, they have made big or big mistakes, and the masses have the most opinions about them. However, they take a dishonest attitude towards the inspection of work, often putting a big hat on themselves first: "I shielded the target", "I occupied more of the fruits of the masses, and I must withdraw this time", "I made a big mistake, I am sorry to the masses", but they do not reveal the process and ideological essence of their mistakes at all. They are of poor quality, stubborn in their thinking, and slow to realize.
    Different attitudes and different positions often lead to opposing understandings of a problem in the work of inspection. For example: the issue of party member Liu Quanqing buying fruits (outhouses) during the mass movement, some party members said: "This outhouse is far from Quanqing and close to Quanxi (non-party member). Both families wanted to buy it. In fact, it would be most appropriate for Quanxi to buy it after Quanqing had an outhouse. As a result, Quanqing colluded with the deputy village chief and bought the outhouse for only a few hundred yuan, which the masses reacted to poorly." Some party members said: "What's wrong with buying an outhouse with money? Quanqing is still an ordinary person even if he is not a cadre. There would be no opinion if he bought it." For example: the instructor exchanged a donkey with the cooperative, and as a result, the cooperative lost 40,000 yuan. Regarding this issue, some party members believed: "The instructor wanted to exchange the donkey, and the cooperative was like wearing pants on the head, unable to save face." Some said: "The cooperative's loss of money is not the instructor's fault. The price of the donkey exchange was fair at the time." For example: middle peasant Yang Xijing was dragged to Dongxue to struggle for stealing party member Yang Suichao's quilt and the village chief's pair of buckets. The village chief got one and a half mu of good land, Suichao got three houses, and Suichao's brother got two mu of land. When discussing this issue, some party members said: "Don't blame the cadres: the masses were very enthusiastic at the time, and the cadres couldn't control it. This is the cadre becoming the tail of the masses." Some said: "Don't talk about the masses. The masses always look at the cadres. If the cadres couldn't control the struggle against Xijing, why did the masses struggle against Yang Qiushun (director of the Armed Forces Committee, the deputy village chief's brother-in-law) three times, but the cadres couldn't control it!" Some said: "The village chief gave the land to the Zhen family, and it was also enlightened to give it to the Zhen family. It wasn't for himself." Some said: "The village chief gave the land to the Zhen family, and also asked the Zhen family's children to carry water for him for half a year. Who was this for?!"
    The problem is very obvious, two positions: one is the mass position that reflects the thoughts and emotions of the masses and represents the interests and demands of the masses; the other is the selfish ideological emotion, the "gang" position. At this time, the "gang" position became the only obstacle to improving the criticism and self-criticism movement. Without dismantling the "gang" position ideologically, the movement cannot move forward. To this end, the work team raised all the opposing issues arising from the two positions in the above-mentioned inspection work for everyone to discuss: "Why are there two views on one issue?" and proposed: This is a matter of personal position and mass position.
    After some discussion, the eyes of some party members became brighter, and their ability to understand problems also improved. Many comrades examined themselves and found that: their butts were sitting crooked. Yang Suichao said: "Yesterday I discussed Tiancheng's (former branch secretary) buying a house. At that time, I thought: Tiancheng sold his own land and cattle to buy these good houses (fruits). What's wrong with this? Today, I think: my butt is sitting crooked. Although Tiancheng sold his land and cattle to buy the house, he then got more land and donkeys in the struggle. Is this something the branch secretary should do?"
    The party members in the middle state began to change and also joined in the criticism and self-criticism. For example, the branch secretary was silent for several days, not in high spirits, and had been lying on the table making records; but when examining the positions, he felt that he had to speak (couldn't remain neutral), so he made a more profound criticism when examining the work of the branch committee, the deputy secretary, and the village chief.
    The party members' attitude towards criticism and self-criticism became more serious, and their pursuit of problems became more serious. Therefore, a few backward elements who insisted on the "gang" position felt isolated and felt the pressure of the party members and the masses, and began to lower their heads. For example: the branch organization committee member, everyone criticized him several times at the beginning, and he dealt with it with a joking attitude; at this time, his jokes could not continue. He examined himself for shielding his relative Yang Linchao (rich peasant). Everyone asked him: "Why did you shield him?" He replied: "Because he is a relative, I have to take care of him." Some said: "Not only because he is a relative, but also because Linchao gave you a piece of dirt, and bought you off." He replied: "Lin Chao's land was because he thought the burden was heavy, and I was planting it on a mortgage." Everyone said: "Lin Chao didn't think the burden was heavy before, just when you became an activist in the mass movement, he gave you the land? What's the reason for this!?" Everyone exposed more of his bad facts, and he lowered his head. For example, Li Baoquan, he was a labor-military combination hero, very proud, and no matter how much he was criticized in the past, he never cared and even wanted to withdraw from the party. Now he examines his problem of retaliating against Yang Laoba with Yang Xiaochou and others. He resisted with the three words "can't remember", which aroused public anger among party members, and they all stood up to criticize him, and he was speechless and cried loudly.
    V. The Problem of Activists in Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism
    The emergence of activists is with the development and deepening of the work of inspection, with the re-differentiation and combination of the party members' thoughts, and cannot be subjectively stipulated by the leadership; but we cannot wait for ready-made activists, and we must consciously and purposefully discover and cultivate them. To cultivate activists, the first thing is to select party members who have a correct attitude towards Party rectification and perform actively, conduct individual education, ask them to understand the thoughts and emotions of some comrades around them, and help other comrades recognize their mistakes.
    Secondly, in the work of inspection, especially in the initial stage of the work of inspection, the leadership should always inspire and improve the party members' ability to understand problems, timely support correct opinions, and criticize wrong opinions. Affirming the position of the activists can enable the middle elements to improve their understanding and change their attitude; the few people who insist on the wrong position are isolated and have to bow their heads.
    Third, the final formation of activists is to adjust the leadership composition. The basic conditions that the leadership put forward for the new branch committee are: (1) Distinguish between the boundaries between landlords and peasants, do not shield, and do not engage in private retaliation. (2) Be fair in handling affairs. (3) Struggle first, and divide the fruits later. (4) Be enthusiastic about the cause of the masses. At this time, the party members nominated candidates with a serious and responsible attitude and elected the new branch committee. At that time, the party members who participated in the election nominated candidates in three groups, stipulating that each group nominate six people. As a result, the three groups nominated only seven people, who were precisely the better elements and activists who emerged in the criticism and self-criticism. Of the three new branch committee members who were finally elected, Liu Xuegeng was elected with thirty-one votes, which shows that he is an activist supported by the vast number of party members and the masses.
    Before the activists have not clearly formed, special meetings of activists should not be held, as this easily isolates the activists among the party members and the masses; but after the ideological camp of the party members has been differentiated, the middle elements have been transformed, and the people who insist on making mistakes have been isolated and bowed their heads, the activists should be used in an organized manner.

　　匠礼村初步整党的经过与经验
    太岳新华分社
  　一、匠礼支部的历史特点
    匠礼支部是在抗日战争中——一九四四年五月建立，在反奸清算（大运动）、土地改革等反封建斗争中发展壮大起来的。三十二个党员中，工人一个、雇农一个、贫农二十三个、中农七个，没有地主和富农（秋顺的成份可能是富农、待查）；没有流氓。
    匠礼支部一般说是在抗日战争中、在反封建的斗争中受过锻炼和考验的。四六年参军，在杨冠鼎、杨逢喜等同志带头号召下，四十七个青年一次踊跃参军，其中有党员十一人；去年八月在支部领导下，三十七个青年参军，其中有党员八人。支部曾培养出有名的民兵夜明珠。现在的三十二个党员中，有十七个是民兵或当过民兵，四个是退伍军人，七个是参战功臣，七个是作战功臣，两个是生产模范，一个是互助模范，有两个是功上加功。但支部党员，特别是领导干部，背着功臣包袱，表现高傲自大。
    匠礼支部基本上是团结的；但他们的团结夹杂着一些不正确的男女关系与亲属关系。他们作了许多侵犯人民利益的事情，严重的脱离了群众，群众把他们叫做“一伙子、一圪串。”
    二、匠礼党群关系的情况和整党的障碍
    在进行初步整党前，今年五六月间，匠礼曾作过一般纠偏工作，当初发动群众时，有些误斗户及一些不满分子，和别有用心分子，把几年以来积下的各种各样的对党员的不满，都一泻而出，对党员提了许多意见，揭发了许多领导上没有发现或没有引起领导上注意的侵犯人民利益的行为。为解决这些问题，当时领导上曾督促党员进行反省，准备向群众承认错误。
    但那时没有发动贫雇农自觉起来纠偏，也没有发动支部领导纠偏、整党，而是踢开支部去干。党员思想上没有准备，群众的压力就来了，并夹杂着某些偏激报复行为，要打干部。这样就使党员与群众之间、党员与领导之间，形成尖锐的对立。党员一律躺倒不干，说：“当干部倒了八辈子！”
    两个月后，今年十月四号工作组到匠礼村时，上述党员与群众对立、与领导对立，以及由此而产生的消极悲观，基本上没有变，党员在群众面前抬不起头，说话没人听，一切工作都推不动。但他们不懂得这是自己在工作中违犯群众利益、脱离群众必然的结果，应该检讨自己，来改善党群关系；相反，他们埋怨纠偏，说：“纠了偏，群众民主了，自由了，没办法！”因此，他们继续采取了与群众对立的态度，对整党采取消极应付或对抗的态度。有些党员计划：“秋后到西面搞运输吧！”企图躲避整党。
    三、传达整党方针，检查党与群众关系，引起警惕，提高觉悟
    为了转变党员与群众对立的态度，使党员回头检讨自己，开展批评与自我批评，工作组在党员中，从以下两方面进行了耐心的工作。
    第一步，个别谈，开会讲。主要的内容是：（一）肯定支部有成绩，但也有缺点与错误，党群关系很不好，党必须整，说明上级整党的决心，批评了对整党消极应付的态度。（二）传达整党方针，着重传达整党方法中的几个原则，强调党员自觉整党，强调全面的历史，弄清是非、功过。（三）根据支部党员的思想情况，讲解共产党员的标准，并指出革命的前途，批判了党员中的消极悲观、走下坡路的思想，指出农民过去跟着共产党翻了身，离开共产党就无法摆脱穷困。
    这些问题的提出，对于很久以来党员思想上的凝固状态开始有了启发，有的党员说：“听了报告，就觉得自己不象共产党员，人家讲的毛病，咱身上都有。”有的逐渐感觉到：过去躺倒不干吃了亏，群众离咱越远了。一般党员对整党认识开始转变，对工作组冷淡的应付态度，也开始好转了，开会也容易召集了。但这个时期党员对于党脱离群众的严重性，还没有觉悟到。还没有认识到群众对党的不满，是由于党员侵犯群众利益的结果，没有认识到今天整党首先应该检讨自己。
    因此，第二步，工作组就号召着重检查党与群众关系。工作组提出：匠礼党群关系很不好。支部书记马上说：“对干部不满意的，也是少数的几家被斗户，一般的群众没啥。”党员邢福宽说：“不要说没啥，我看群众脱离了一多半！”石得荣说：“到底脱离了多少，这好办，咱从牌楼根起一户一户往后数，看看没意见的有几户。”这样一数，问题出来了：全村除十二户地主、农富外，共农民二百九十八户，对党员、干部的态度，可分三类：提意见和积极反对的，共一百六十二户，占全体农民的百分之五十四点三。不表示态度的八十五户，占农民的百分之二十八点五。拥护干部的五十一户，占农民的百分之十七点一。对干部提出意见和积极反对的原因是：（一）历年运动中，由于执行政策的某些错误与私人报复而被侵犯的共五十七户，占不满户百分之三十五（编者按：私人报复不应计算在此项内，而应计算在（三）项内）。（二）历年运动中，由于干部多占果实、办事不公，而引起群众不满的计四十四户，占百分之二十七。（三）由于干部作风生硬与私人成见，而被打击过的，计三十二户，占百分之十九。（四）由于在运动中干部没照顾到、或因私见没翻身的十六户，占百分之十。（五）与干部有私人纠纷而不满的十三户，占百分之七。不表示态度的八十五户：多半是老平气人、小娃不懂事的、女人不管事的。拥护干部的五十一户：（一）党员本人家庭或亲戚三十四户。（二）运动中受干部特别照顾翻透身的十三户。（三）历年运动中从未伤害过的富裕中农与老中农，计六户。（编者按：为何比原户数多了二户？）
    这样检查党群关系的结果，党员的思想被震动了，眼睛也瞪大了。支部书记说：“啊呀！事情怕人着哩！怪不得群众见了咱理都不理，原来都有意见。”合作社理事邢福宽说：“我看现在不整党，再过上半年，群众就把咱当成蒋介石了！”石得荣说：“以前咱只顾生产，不想工作。现在想：把群众也丢啦，赚上三万两万有啥意思！”
    在这种觉悟的基础上，接着又检讨了抗日时期，杨小东带领的民兵打敌人，为啥群众反对（放哨不负责任，搜腰包）？以后夜明珠（党员）领导了民兵，群众为啥拥护（能保护群众，纪律也较好）？刘致乐领导的农会，为啥群众要改组它（不代表贫苦人利益）？原志中领导了农会，群众为什么拥护等问题。使党员把亲身体验到的事实，加以讨论、回忆，使党员认识到：匠礼支部并不是一开始就脱离群众，在打日本与反奸清算的前一段，群众对党员是拥护的。这样，使他们认识到：群众的眼睛是雪亮的，是讲道理的，谁办好事就拥护谁，谁办坏事就反对谁；什么时候为群众，群众就什么时候拥护；什么时候侵害群众，群众就什么时候反对。这样引导党员认识党群关系，引导党员检讨工作、检讨自己，批评与自我批评运动，就一步一步展开了。
    四、检查工作深入，批评与自我批评使运动提高了一步
    随着批评与自我批评的展开，每个党员的态度，逐渐明确；在检讨工作的后期，支部党员大体可分为三种类型：第一类、如刘雪庚等七同志，他们能积极的、主动的揭发问题，他们为人正派，错误很少或较少，觉悟较高；纠偏中群众对他没意见或很少；他们能反映群众的思想情绪，代表群众的要求。第二类、如原存柱（支书）、许玉轩（支宣、农会主席）、杨小林（妇会秘书）第二十三个同志，他们自己错不大，对自己的错误也不包藏。但对于别的同志的错误不愿揭发、追究，实质上是宗派情绪。第三类、村长、副支书等四同志，他们错误很大或较大，群众对他们意见也最多。但对检讨工作采取不老实的态度，常是先给自己戴上大帽子：“我包庇了对象”，“我多占了群众的果实，这回一定要退出”、“我错误很大，对不起群众”，但他们犯错误的过程、思想实质，却一点也不揭露，他们品质不好，思想顽固、觉悟很慢。
    态度不同，立场不同，反映在检讨工作中一个问题的认识，也常常对立。例如：党员刘全庆在大运动时买果实（茅厕）的问题，有的党员说：“这个茅厕离全庆远，离全喜（非党员）近，两家都想买，实际全庆有了茅厕，全喜买下最合适，结果是全庆与副村长串通，只出了几百元，把茅厕买下，群众反映不好。”有的党员说：“出钱买茅厕有啥错？全庆不当干部还是个老百姓，买下就没有意见了。”又例如：指导员与合作社换了一头驴，结果合作社赔了四万元。对这问题，有的党员认为：“指导员要换驴，合作社是圪脑上穿套裤，摸不下脸气。”有的说：“合作社赔钱不怪指导员，当时换驴价钱作的公道。”又例如：中农杨西井因偷了党员杨随朝的被子和村长的一付水桶，因而拉到冬学斗争了一顿，村长得好地一亩半，随朝得三间房、随朝哥得地二亩。讨论这个问题时，有的党员说：“不怪干部：当时群众热烈的很，干部也掌握不住，这是干部当了群众的尾巴。”有的说：“不要说群众吧，群众什时也是看干部，斗西井，干部掌握不住，为啥斗杨秋顺（武委会主任，副村长的连襟）时群众斗争了三次，干部就掌握住斗不了！”有的说：“村长得下地，又开明给甄家了，这也不是为自己。”有的说：“村长把地开明给甄家，又叫甄家娃娃给他担了半年水，这是为谁！？”
    问题是很明显的，两种立场：一种是反映群众思想情绪，代表群众的利益与要求的群众立场；另一种是反映利己主义的思想情绪，“一伙伙”立场。这时候，“一伙伙”的立场就成为批评与自我批评运动提高一步的唯一障碍。不从思想上拆散“一伙伙”立场，运动就不能前进。为此，工作组把上述检讨工作中由于两种立场而产生的认识上的对立的问题，都提出来让大家讨论：“为什么一个问题有两种看法？”并提出：这是个人立场与群众立场问题。
    经过一番讨论，使一些党员的眼睛更加明亮了，认识问题的能力也提高了。许多同志都检查出：自己的屁股坐歪了。杨随朝说：“昨天讨论天成（前支书）买房问题，当时想着：天成把自家的地卖了、牛卖了，买下这几间好房子（果实），这有啥问题？今天一想：自己的屁股坐歪了。天成买房，虽然卖了地、卖了牛，可是他接着又在斗争中得了更多的地，得到驴，这是支部书记应干的事？”
    中间状态的党员开始转变，也卷入批评与自我批评。如支书好几天沉默不言、情绪不高，一直爬在桌上作记录；但检讨到立场，他感觉不说话不行了（中立不住），于是在检讨支委组织，副书记和村长的工作时，他都作了较深刻的批判。
    党员们的批评与自我批评的态度更加严肃了，对问题的追究更加认真了。因而少数坚持“一伙伙”立场的落后分子，感到自己孤立，感受到党员群众的压力、开始低头了。例如：支部组织委员，开始大家几次对他批评，他都以开玩笑的态度应付；到了这时，他的玩笑也就开不下去了。他检讨自己包庇本家哥杨林超（富农）的错误。大家问他：“为什么包庇？”他答：“因为是本家，要照顾。”有的说：“不光因为是本家哥，还因为林超给了你一块圪垛地，把你收买了。”他答：“林超的地是他嫌负担重，我典种的。”大家说：“林超以前就不嫌负担重，恰好在大运动时你当了积极分子，就把地给你了？这是啥道理！？”大家揭发他更多的坏事实，他低头了。又例如李保全，他是劳武结合英雄，十分骄傲，过去不管怎样批评他，老不在乎，还要退党。现在检讨他与杨小丑等报复打击杨老八的问题。他以“记不清”三个字来抵抗，激起党员公愤，一致起来批评他，他理屈词穷，大哭起来。
    五、开展批评与自我批评中的积极分子问题
    积极分子的出现，是随着检讨工作的展开与深入、随着党员思想的重新分化与结合而出现的，不能由领导上主观规定；但也不能等待现成的积极分子，必须有意识的、有计划的发现培养。培养积极分子，首先是选择对整党态度端正、表现积极的党员，进行个别教育，叫他们了解自己周围一些同志的思想情绪，并帮助别的同志认识错误。
    其次，是在检讨工作中、特别是检讨工作的开始阶段，领导上应随时启发、提高党员认识问题的能力，适时的扶植正确的意见，批评错误的意见。肯定积极分子的立场，这样就能使中间分子认识提高，态度转变；坚持错误立场的少数人陷于孤立，只好低头。
    第三、积极分子最后形成是调整领导成份。领导上提出新支委应具备的起码条件是：（一）分清地主与农民的界线，不包庇、不私人报复。（二）办事公正。（三）斗争在先，分果实在后。（四）热心群众事业。这时，党员们以严肃负责的态度提出候选人，选举了新支委。当时参加选举的党员，分三个小组提候选人，规定每组提六人，结果三个组仅提出七个人，正是批评与自我批评中涌现出来的较好分子与积极分子。最后当选的三个新支委，刘雪庚以三十一票当选，这说明他是广大党员群众拥护的积极分子。
    在积极分子没有明确形成之前，不应特殊的召开积极分子大会，这样容易使积极分子在党员群众中孤立；但党员思想阵营已经分化，中间分子转变，坚持错误分子孤立低头之后，对积极分子即应有组织的放手使用。
