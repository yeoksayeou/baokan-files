　　The Cadre Study Class in Baixuan Village

　　Most of the cadres in Baixuan Village, Shexian County, were worker-peasant cadres who emerged during the work expansion in 1942. The vast majority were illiterate, and they often felt distressed in their work. This time, under the promotion of Comrades Wei Qiaoying (district cadre) and Hao Yazhi (principal of the Seventh High School), the study movement in the village was launched. On January 2nd, Wei Qiaoying and Hao Yazhi researched the cadre's study situation, and on the morning of the 3rd, they convened a meeting of all village cadres. At the meeting, Comrade Qiaoying first talked to the village cadres about the importance of studying culture, and then asked everyone to discuss: "In order to overcome the difficulties in our work, do we need to study?" "How can we study to improve ourselves?" During the discussion, the village chief, Niu Yutang, said: "Study is very necessary. County and district cadres are all studying, and we should also set up a cadre study class!" But the chairman of the farmers' association, Niu Hualin, said: "You go study! I have never entered a study room since I was a child, and I don't know how to pick up a pen. Now that I am over forty years old, can I still study culture? I can't do it." Many people spoke, and there were many different opinions. Later, Comrade Wang Zhuyuan said: "We were illiterate in the past because our families were poor. That's why we need to study even more! It doesn't matter if we are old. Isn't our district cadre, Comrade Xu Chunwang, also over thirty years old when he first came out to work? He was completely illiterate, but now he can write letters!" Finally, Comrade Qiaoying also talked to everyone about how not studying culture would mean falling behind social progress, which opened their minds, and Niu Hualin and Zheng Taiping then said: "Let's give it a try!" Then, according to their cultural level, sixteen people were divided into two groups, A and B, and group leaders and study class leaders were selected, and it was decided to study Chinese, arithmetic, and current affairs.
　　On the morning of the 4th, when the study began, Comrade Wang Zhuyuan got up early and automatically called everyone. Everyone brought their brush pens and notebooks and happily ran to the class, saying: "We are late today, we must be early in the future." District cadres also participated in this study. For example, district cadre Niu Chaowang said when taking notes: "If we had studied like this earlier, it wouldn't have been difficult." After studying for three or four days, Comrade Zhuyuan learned the format of writing letters. When he went to the cooperative and saw a few people there, he talked to them about the format of writing letters. Everyone was very happy to hear this. Niu Yuzhang said: "I will go to study tomorrow!" Within four or five days, three more people were added. The teacher called on Group A to write a diary every other day. They all said they couldn't. After the teacher explained how to write, three cadres have now started to learn to write diaries. Comrade Wang Zhuyuan has already written three. When copying the news of our army's victory in liberating Xuzhou, they requested to draw a map. The teacher drew the map on the blackboard, and they also drew it in their notebooks to learn and recognize the map. This was their first time!
　　Their study class has only been studying for six or seven days, but it has already achieved great results. Comrade Niu Chaowang said: "These days I have learned a little about decimal points, and I have also learned to recognize more than forty new characters. I didn't know how to write letters before, but now I understand." Zheng Taiping said: "I can write my name now." Comrade Wang Zhuyuan said: "When the cadre study class was first established, I also felt that I was too old and afraid that I couldn't learn anything. But since the beginning of school until now, I have learned to recognize thirty or forty new characters. I had never seen a diary before, and now I know how to write a diary. ... I feel that as long as I study hard, it's still okay!" (Shucheng, Chaowang, Zhengqin, Yuxiu, Xingyi)

　　白芟村的干部学习班
    涉县白芟村的干部，大部是四二年开展工作时，涌现出来的工农干部，绝大部分不识字，在工作中常感到苦闷。这次在魏巧英（区干部）郝雅之（七高校长）二同志的推动下，该村的学习运动便展开了。元月二号，魏巧英和郝雅之将组织干部的学习情形研究后，三号清早就召开全村干部会议，在会上首先由巧英同志把学习文化的重要性向村干部谈了一下，再让大家讨论：“咱们为了克服工作中的困难，是否需要学习？”“怎样学习来提高自己？”在讨论时，村长牛玉堂说：“学习非常需要，县区干部都在学习，咱们也要成立干部学习班才对！”但农会主任牛花林说：“你们学习吧！我从小就没有进过书房门，不知怎样提笔。现在四十多岁了，还能学习文化？咱可不行。”发言的很多，意见也不少，后来王竹元同志说：“咱们过去不识字，是咱家过去穷。就是因为这，咱才更需要学习啦！年龄大也不怕，象咱区干部徐春旺同志开始出来做工作，不也是三十多岁吗？一字不识，这几年人家也会写信啦！”最后巧英同志又把不学习文化就跟不上社会前进，和大家谈了，打开了脑筋，牛花林、郑太平才说：“咱就去试试吧！”接着按文化高低将十六个人编为甲乙两组，选出小组长和学习班长，决定学习国语、算术、时事三门功课。
    四号那天清早开始学习时，王竹元同志一早起来，就自动去叫大家，每人都带着毛笔和笔记本，高高兴兴地跑到班里说：“今天迟了，以后一定要早。”区干部也参加这个学习，如区干部牛朝旺同志摘录笔记时说：“咱们早些要象这样学习，早不困难了。”学习了三四天，竹元同志学会了写信的格式。他到合作社，见有几个人在那里，就和他们讲开写信的格式，大家听了很高兴，牛玉章说：“我明天也要去学习！”四五天内又增加了三人。教员号召甲组隔一天写一篇日记，都说不会，教员讲了怎样写后，现在三个干部已开始学写日记。王竹元同志已写了三篇。在抄写我军解放徐州胜利时，他们要求画出地图，教员便把地图画在黑板上，他们也画到笔记本里学，认地图，这还是他们第一次呢！
    他们这个学习班，仅仅学了六七天，就已收到很大成绩。牛朝旺同志说：“我这几天知道点小数点了，我还认会四十多个生字，以前不会写信，现在也懂得了。”郑太平说：“我也会写我的名字了。”王竹元同志说：“在开始成立干部学习班时，我也有些感觉年龄大了，怕学不了东西。可是自开学到现在，我认会三四十个生字。以前咱就没有见过日记、现在也知道怎样写日记了。……我感觉只要好好学习，也还行哩！”（树成、朝旺、征钦、毓秀、兴义）
