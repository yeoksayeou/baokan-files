Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—Reports from various sources: The Indonesian people's anti-Dutch guerrilla war continues to expand. An anti-Dutch armed uprising has recently erupted on Madura Island, northeast of Surabaya, and is expanding. This is a new development in the people's revolutionary movement following the anti-Dutch riots in southern Borneo. In southern Central Java, guerrillas have liberated the port of Bejitan. The activities of guerrillas in the heart of Central Java in the areas of Yogyakarta, Solo, and Madiun have isolated the Dutch troops in this area to their strongholds. Guerrillas have recently frequently attacked Semarang, Cirebon, Bogor, and Medan in Sumatra. The gasoline depot at Semarang Airport was completely destroyed. Important coal mining equipment in the northwest of Cilacap was also destroyed. An Indonesian secret radio station announced: Guerrillas recently continued to destroy four major Dutch colonial rubber plantations, six tea plantations, three major coffee plantations, several coconut plantations, and other facilities in a "scorched earth tactic." The Indonesian UN military observer group also admitted in a recent report to the Security Council: "The Dutch military has proven insufficient to prevent Indonesian sabotage activities, and cannot even maintain order in the cities. Around Surabaya, an important naval base in East Java, all railways have been blocked due to the destruction of many bridges and railway facilities. Many major roads in Central Java remain closed. On those railways that are open to traffic, passage is only possible with escort."

Facing a difficult situation, the Dutch aggressors are stepping up consultations with the captured Sukarno, Hatta, and others, trying to get the latter to join the puppet Indonesian federation they are creating as open Dutch agents to jointly oppose the Indonesian people. On the evening of the 18th, Dutch Prime Minister Drees held an hour and a half of "consultations" in Batavia with Sjahrir, one of the captured Indonesian reactionary leaders. Sjahrir claimed that his talks with Drees were "approved" by Sukarno. On the 19th, both sides announced: "Frank discussions have clarified several important issues" (Agence France-Presse). On the 20th, Drees set off to return to the Netherlands. Before boarding the plane, he told reporters: "The issue of reaching an agreement on federal principles will first be discussed by the Indonesian side (referring to Hatta, etc. and various Indonesian puppet states) themselves." On the 21st, two representatives of the Indonesian puppet states—Dumhan, the pseudo-premier of the "Pasundan" state of West Java, and Aden, the representative of the East Java state—flew to Bangka Island in eastern Sumatra to discuss the issue of "organizing a national government" with Hatta, who was being held there. According to Dutch officials quoting Hatta on the 21st, he was "very satisfied with the treatment he received" (Associated Press).

　　马都拉岛爆发反荷武装起义
  　印尼游击战继续扩大
    中爪哇腹地荷军据点孤立
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：印尼人民的反荷游击战争，继续扩大。泗水东北的马都拉岛最近又爆发了反荷武装起义，并正在扩大中。这是继婆罗洲南部反荷暴动以后人民革命运动的新发展。中爪哇南部，游击队已解放北知丹港。游击队在中爪哇心腹地区日惹、梭罗与茉莉芬一带的活动，已使这一地区的荷军孤立于各据点。游击队最近频袭三宝珑、井里汶、茂物与苏门答腊的棉兰市。三宝珑机场的汽油库尽遭破坏。俊罗西北一带的重要煤矿设备亦遭摧毁。印尼秘密电台宣布：游击队最近在“焦土战术”中继续破坏了荷兰殖民者的四大橡胶园、六个茶叶种植园、三大咖啡园、若干椰子园及其他设备。印尼联合国军事观察组在最近致安理会的报告中也承认：“荷军已证明不足以阻止印尼的破坏活动，甚至不能维持各城市的秩序。东爪哇的重要海军基地泗水周围，由于许多桥梁与铁路设备的破坏，所有铁路皆已被阻。中爪哇的许多主要道路，仍然没有开放。在那些通车的铁路上，也只有经护送才能通行。”
    面临窘境的荷兰侵略者，正加紧与被俘的苏加诺、哈达等磋商，图使后者以荷兰公开代理人的地位，加入它所制造中的印尼傀儡联邦，共同反对印尼人民。十八日晚，荷总理德里斯曾在巴达维亚与被俘的印尼反动头子之一沙利尔举行一小时半的“商谈”，沙利尔宣称，他与德里斯的商谈，系获苏加诺之“认可”。十九日，双方宣布：“坦白的讨论已澄清若干重要问题”（法新社）。二十日，德里斯即起程返荷，他在登机前向报界宣称：“在联邦原则上成立协定问题，将首先由印尼方面（指哈达等与各印尼傀儡邦之间）自行讨论。”二十一日，印尼傀儡邦的代表两名——西爪哇“巴山丹”邦伪总理杜姆汉德与东爪哇邦代表阿登，即飞苏门答腊东部的邦加岛，与被禁于该地的哈达讨论“组织一全国性政府”的问题。据荷官方二十一日引哈达的话说：他“很满意所受的待遇”（美联社）。
