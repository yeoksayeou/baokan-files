Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau Locomotive Depot Inspection Work
　Mobilizing Workers to Improve Leadership
　Depot Chief Yang's Poor Work Style
　Inspection Committee Requests Bureau to Dismiss Him

[Shijiazhuang News] Recently, the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau Locomotive Depot held a conference to summarize the results of a month-long work inspection. This improved the workers' class consciousness, strengthened unity, and laid the foundation for future work improvements. At the meeting, Li Xinbo, Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau, delivered a summary report on behalf of the Work Inspection Committee. The report was divided into four parts: First, the process of the inspection work; second, the problems discovered during the inspection work; third, the shortcomings in leadership; and fourth, the gains from the inspection work. The inspection work was roughly divided into three stages: mobilization, material collection, and repeated discussions. At the beginning of the inspection, the workers had very different understandings. Apart from a few workers who recognized the significance of the inspection and put forward excellent suggestions, some thought that the Bureau had sent people to inspect them, and that they were being inspected, so they cleaned their tables meticulously, waiting for inspection; others said, "I go to work and leave work on time, I have nothing to hide, inspect if you want," so the inspection work was difficult to deepen. After various meetings, it was repeatedly explained that the inspection work was to improve work, and only then was it accepted by everyone. After this, the workers boldly exposed Chief Yang's many erroneous thoughts and work styles, criticized Political Commissar Li for not doing a good job in education, revealed many unplanned and unorganized phenomena in production, and put forward many constructive suggestions. At the previous conference, Chief Yang did not accept criticism well, and the workers were very dissatisfied with him; Political Commissar Li made a public self-criticism. After the meeting, the workers said, "The Communist Party is still the Communist Party," which enhanced the Party's prestige among the masses. In summarizing the second part, Deputy Director Li first affirmed the achievements of the Locomotive Depot in the past year. He said: "Generally speaking, there have been great achievements. In extremely difficult conditions, the train operation has been guaranteed, especially in military transport, emergency transport, and war preparedness, which demonstrated the workers' high level of work enthusiasm, with a large number of model workers emerging, and emergency tasks being completed." However, after a month of inspection, it was found that there were still many shortcomings in the work, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Lack of planning and organization in production, such as locomotive maintenance being unplanned, resulting in a chaotic state; no statistics on the amount of work done in repairs for half a year, and it taking several hours just to collect materials; no one in charge of the utilization of waste materials. (2) Lack of an inspection system; workers reported that no one paid attention to their opinions, and good or bad work could not be distinguished. (3) Lack of necessary rules and regulations. In summarizing the shortcomings in leadership, Deputy Director Li pointed out: Chief Yang not only has many thoughts and work styles from the Kuomintang era, but also has many erroneous and improper practices and words and deeds that oppose leadership, such as saying: "The Bureau is a foreign Bureau, it is simply impossible to work!" He cursed workers as smelly workers who could not be awakened even after thirty years, and deceived superiors during war preparedness, saying that the machines were dismantled when they were not, and also said: "It gives me a headache as soon as I touch the Eighth Route Army," and such examples are too numerous to mention. Deputy Director Li, on behalf of the Inspection Committee, announced that it had requested the Bureau to dismiss Chief Yang, and criticized Political Commissar Li for failing to help Chief Yang correct these errors in a timely manner, and that being too accommodating was wrong. Finally, Deputy Director Li pointed out that the main gains of this inspection work are: (1) Improved the overall level of consciousness, improved the relationship between workers and leaders, and the mutual relationship between departments; (2) All workers put forward many constructive suggestions, such as overcoming the phenomenon of disorganization and lack of planning in production, and establishing various systems; (3) Accepted many experiences and lessons, such as: 1. Leading production must go deep into the masses to improve mass consciousness; 2. Management personnel with old work styles should be helped politically to make progress and become revolutionary staff; 3. The phenomenon of disorganization and lack of planning in production must be overcome; 4. Close unity, and Communist Party members should play a exemplary role; 5. Technology and politics should be well combined. Then he spoke on behalf of the Bureau, and the representatives of the Locomotive Depot Trade Union, Factory Director Wang of the Forward Factory, and Section Chief Xu of the Personnel Department also spoke, giving everyone a lot of encouragement.

　　石市铁路局机务段检查工作
  　发动职工改进领导
  　杨段长作风不好
  　检查委会呈请路局撤职
    【石家庄讯】日前，石家庄铁路局机务段召开大会，总结一月来工作检查结果，提高了职工阶级觉悟，加强了团结，替今后的工作改进打下了基础。在会上，铁路局副局长李新波同志代表工作检查委员会作总结报告。报告共分四部分：第一、检查工作的过程，第二、检查工作当中发现的问题，第三、领导上的缺点，第四、检查工作中的收获。检查工作大概分为动员、搜集材料与反复讨论三个阶级。检查工作开始时，职工认识很不一致，除少数工人认识了检查工作的意义并提出了很好的意见外，有人则以为是路局派人来检查，自己是被检查的，把棹子擦得干干净净等待检查；有人则表示：“我到时候上班下班，心中没病，爱检查不检查”，因此检查工作很难深入，经过各种会议，反复说明了检查工作是为了改进工作，才为大家接受。此后，职工们才大胆揭发了杨段长许多错误的思想作风，批评李政委没把教育工作作好，揭露了生产中许多无计划无组织的现象，并提出了许多建设性的意见。在前次大会上，杨段长未很好接受批评，职工对他很不满意；李政委公开进行了自我批评，会后工人们说：“共产党还是共产党”，提高了党在群众中的威信。在总结第二部分中，李副局长首先肯定一年来机务段的工作成绩，他说：就全部来说有很大成绩。在极困难条件下保证了行车，特别在军运抢运和备战工作中，表现了职工们高度的工作热忱，涌现了不少工作模范，完成了紧急任务。但经过一月来的检查，发现工作中还存在许多缺点，归纳起来可分为（一）生产中的无计划无组织，如机车检修没有计划，成了乱抓状态；装修出了多少活半年无统计，光领材料须几个钟头；对废料的利用无人管。（二）缺乏检查制度，工人们反映提了意见无人管，工作好的坏的都显不出来。（三）缺乏必要的规章制度。在总结领导上的缺点时，李副局长指出：杨段长不但有许多国民党时代的思想作风，而且存在着许多错误的不正派的作法和反对领导的言行，如说：“路局是外国路局，简直不能干！”骂工人是臭工人，三十年也不能觉悟，备战时欺骗上级，机器没拆完说拆完了，还说：“一沾八路军就头痛”，诸如此类不胜枚举。李副局长代表检查委员会宣布已呈请路局撤消杨段长的职务，并批评李政委未能及时帮助杨段长改正这些错误，过于迁就是错误的。最后李副局长指出这次检查工作的主要收获是：（一）提高了全体的觉悟程度，改善了职工对领导上的关系，与各部间相互的关系；（二）全体职工提出许多建设性的意见，如克服生产上的无组织无计划现象，建立各种制度；（三）接受了许多经验教训，如：一、领导生产必须深入群众提高群众觉悟；二、对带有旧作风的管理人员应多从政治上帮助他们进步，使他变成一个革命职员；三、必须克服生产中无组织无计划的现象；四、亲密团结，共产党员应起模范作用；五、技术与政治应很好结合起来。接着他又代表路局讲了话，机务段工会代表、前进工厂王厂长、人事处许处长等都先生讲话，对大家给了很多勉励。
