　　To the People's Daily:
　　Having read your newspaper's (December 24th) No. 191, page four, "Criticism and Suggestions" column—farmers in thirteen villages in the Dongjiao area urgently hope that the Huolu and Jingxing governments will quickly take advantage of the winter slack season to lead the opening of canals. We deeply admire your company's concern for the masses and do not strongly object to the opening of canals in Dongjiao and other thirteen villages to increase production, but we have several opinions that we would like to state in this letter. We respectfully hope that you will adopt them to clarify the truth and stop the suggestions to the government.
　　1. Insufficient Water Volume: The report stated: "The Wenshui River (i.e., the Ye River) from Sunzhuang to the Ping Mountain section still has many springs at the bottom of the river, and the construction of new canals will not affect the water use downstream." In fact, there are indeed many springs at the bottom of the Wenshui River; however, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate whether the springs along the river below Sunzhuang are sufficient for the use of the original canals downstream. The report also stated: "During the severe drought this summer, there was still a lot of water downstream." This statement is even more unfounded. This spring and summer, the canal was short of water, and there were constant disputes over upstream interception and downstream digging. After the Fourth Special District Commissioner's Office and the Ping Mountain County Government sent personnel to resolve the issue, the lowest canal was still affected by drought, and grain production was significantly reduced. If new canals are not added, it will be like this. If the Dongjiao and other villages open new canals, it will be self-evident.
　　2. Weighing the Pros and Cons: Our government now has a comprehensive grasp of mass production. If the new canals in Dongjiao and other villages can transform more than 40,000 mu of land into paddy fields, but affect the downstream water use, at least 40,000 mu of downstream land will be transformed into dry land. It will take a lot of manpower and financial resources to turn dry land into paddy fields, and production will not necessarily increase at that time. The production volume of rice fields converted into dry land is less than the original dry land. In terms of the masses, Dongjiao and other villages may benefit, but the downstream canals will be harmed. Harming this and benefiting that, the government will never do this. In addition, new canals will not be taxed according to paddy fields at that time, and newly converted dry land will also be taxed according to dry land. The difference in public revenue (tens of thousands of mu) is very large. If the government vigorously leads the masses to open new canals, but affects the existing water conservancy, is it appropriate?
　　3. Thorough Investigation: The masses' standpoint is inevitable, and the government and your company's starting point is impartiality. One-sided statements are unreliable. In addition to conducting on-the-spot investigation, please also inquire with the Fourth Special District Commissioner's Office and the Ping Mountain Government: whether the water volume of the Wenshui River this spring and summer is sufficient for the use of the original canals, and whether regulation is implemented. This letter is respectfully submitted, with regards.

### 请调查东焦一带修渠是否影响温水河下游使水？

　　请调查东焦一带修渠是否影响温水河下游使水？
    人民日报社：
    顷阅贵报（十二月二十四日）第一九一号第四版批评与建议一栏——东焦一带十三村农民急盼获鹿井陉政府快趁冬闲领导开渠，我们对贵社关心群众之精神，深为钦佩，对东焦等十三村开渠增产，亦不敢强力阻止，但有意见几项，愿函述之。敬希采纳，以明真相，停止对政府之建议是盼。
    一、水量不足：报载：“温水河（即冶河）”孙庄到平山一段，河底还有许多水泉，修新渠并不影响下游使水云云，”查温水河河底之泉，实属多有；但孙庄以下沿河泉水，是否足供下游原有渠滩之使用，尚须彻底考查。又载：“今夏亢旱时，下游水仍很多云云，”此语更属无稽之谈。查今春今夏，该渠滩均感缺水，上拦下扒，纠纷不断。后经四专署实业科及平山县府派员解决，结果最下渠滩仍受涸旱，粮食生产颇形减收，不增新渠尚且如是，若东焦等村再开新渠，当然不言可喻了。
    二、权衡利害：现我政府对群众生产是全盘掌握的；倘东焦等村新渠开成后可变水地四万多亩，但影响了下游使水，最少下游要变四万多亩旱地；旱地变水田须耗不少人力与财力，当时生产亦不见得增多；稻地变为旱田，其生产量反不及原来旱地。在群众方面，东焦等村可能受益，但下游渠滩则将受其害。害此利彼，想政府决不此为。又新开渠道，当时不按水地征税，初变旱地，亦须按旱地征收。计算公收（数万亩）差数甚巨。倘以政府大力领导群众开成新渠，却影响了已成水利，是否适当？
    三、彻底调查：群众的本位难免，政府与贵社的出发大公。一面之词固不可靠，请贵社除实地澈查外，再详询四专署与平山政府：今年春夏温水河水量是否足供原有渠滩之使用，是否实行调剂。特此函奉，并致敬礼
