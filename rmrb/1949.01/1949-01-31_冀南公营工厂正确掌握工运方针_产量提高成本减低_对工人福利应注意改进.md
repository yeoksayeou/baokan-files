Jinnan Telegraph: The public factories throughout the district have correctly grasped the policy of the labor movement, achieving results in December. The Fuchang Flour Company in Handan City, after studying the labor movement's principles and policies in November of last year, raised the production enthusiasm of workers. Based on existing conditions, output greatly increased, and recently various chaotic phenomena have been corrected, achieving cost reductions. From the study, workers recalled many past instances of waste, which hindered cost reduction. Repairman Yin said, "In the past, we obtained materials without going through the foreman. We got caustic soda but didn't use it, so we boiled it to make soap for ourselves. In the future, we must go through the foreman, and any leftovers should be returned to the warehouse." Worker Xu said, "Previously, we took scrap iron from the company to make cooking ladles. In the future, we must pay attention to utilizing waste materials and saving raw materials." Workers like Yang Feng recalled that in the past, they didn't go to work on time, dozed off during work, the person in charge of bread wasn't accurate, and boiler workers weren't precise in firing the boilers. Apprentices also pointed out their past shortcomings, such as not being proactive and not diligently wiping down the machines. Clerical staff also reviewed their past shortcomings in product promotion and material management. One staff member admitted that he had fed third-grade bad flour to the workers' pigs, and borrowed sacks were unaccounted for, and he didn't know who borrowed them, etc. After repeated deliberation and discussion, they unanimously agreed that reducing costs required taking care of machines, saving raw materials, and overcoming wasteful phenomena. To this end, the following systems were jointly established: 1. Attendance system: Hang a tag when starting work and remove it when finishing to ensure on-time attendance for evaluation. 2. Material requisition system: Requisitions must be known to the team leader, reviewed by the engineering department, and unused materials returned. 3. Leave application system. 4. Learning system. 5. Establish a daily flour and bran output reporting system so that daily and nightly production can be understood and compared in a timely manner. 6. Inspection system: The engineering department inspects every hour, and every two hours, the team leader submits samples of first- and second-grade flour and bran to the responsible person for inspection. If the factory finds that the flour does not meet the standard or the bran is not clean, it immediately studies improvements. Because this system was consciously formulated by the workers, its implementation is quite smooth. After studying the spirit of the labor movement's instructions, workers at the Public Interest Oil Press Factory have gradually brought production back to normal. Although the number of personnel has been reduced, production efficiency remains at the original level, and workers can also work proactively. Xue Tingchun, who manages raw materials, was afraid that the damp seeds would be difficult to process, so he automatically selected dry seeds, ensuring an extra 500 catties of cottonseed pressed per day. Zhu Wenge constantly inspected the machines and found the gear teeth were long. To avoid delaying work, he repaired them overnight, having worked the night shift three times in a month. Although work was suspended for half a day in ten days due to machine failure, 93,826 catties of cottonseed were still pressed, maintaining approximately 10,000 catties per day. Encouraged by the victorious situation, the workers of the Datong Motor Company intensified their work. When transporting northbound cadres, because the car was broken and could not be repaired, all the workers who were not on duty requested to work overtime at night. In the past, going to work was always slow, but now, not only do they go to work on time, but they don't leave even after the end-of-shift bell rings. They all want to finish their work before leaving. Except for individual factories, the spirit of the labor movement has been deeply implemented throughout the district. Labor systems have been established, and the organization of trade unions has been improved. In terms of business management, general attention has been paid to cost accounting. In the past, the Matouli Oil Factory estimated the amount of cottonseed pressed, but now it implements weighing and daily cost accounting. The Gongyi Porcelain Factory pays attention to the quality of raw materials purchased, calculates them regularly, and establishes contacts with Xinji, Ningzhang, and other places to understand market conditions in a timely manner. Factories such as Fuchang Hongji and Jinnan Printing Factory have divided their labor into shifts; the flour factory is divided into night and day shifts, and the production volume is compared on the second day. As a result, it was found that the difference between the day and night shifts was 559 catties, so those who produced less quickly worked hard to catch up, and production increased as a result. In order to prepare for this year's great production, all factories have formulated production plans. The Matouli Oil Factory has purchased more than 800,000 catties of cottonseed and 140,000 catties of peanuts, and repaired a machine. In the past, 4,000 to 5,000 catties of cottonseed were pressed per day. After adding machines, more than 8,000 catties of cottonseed can be pressed per day. The shortcoming is the widespread lack of attention to workers' welfare, which should be addressed in the future.

　　冀南公营工厂正确掌握工运方针
  　产量提高成本减低
    对工人福利应注意改进
    【冀南电】全区公营工厂正确掌握职工运动方针，十二月份已获成绩。邯郸市复昌面粉公司，从去年十一月份学习了工运方针与政策，提高了工人的生产积极性，根据现有条件，使产量大大提高，近又纠正了各种紊乱现象，达到减低成本。从学习中工人们想起过去有不少浪费，都妨碍了成本的降低。尹修理匠说：“过去领材料不经工长，领了火碱用不了，就熬肥皂自己用了。今后一定要经过工长，剩下即交仓库。”徐工友说：“以前拿公家废铁做炒菜瓢用，今后要注意利用废料、节省原料。”杨峰等工友回想起过去不按时上下班，上着班打盹，管面包的掌握不准，锅炉工友烧火不准。学徒的也说出自己过去不主动，机器擦的不勤等缺点。各科职员亦检讨出过去在推销产品上及物资管理上，均有不少缺点。一个职员检讨出自己把三等坏面给工友喂了猪；借出的麻袋没有数，也不知谁借的等。经过他们反复酝酿讨论，一致认为减低成本须爱护机器，节省原料克服浪费现象。为此，共同规定了下列制度：一、上下班制度，上班挂牌，下班摘牌，保证按时上下班，以资考勤。二、领发材料制度，领时经领班知道，工务科审查，用不完交回。三、请假制度。四、学习制度。五、建立每日面粉麸皮产量表报制度，这样每日夜产品能及时了解，并能比较。六、检查制度，工务科每小时查一回，每二小时领班把头、二等面粉麸皮样子交负责人检看，厂部发现面粉跟不上标准面，麸皮不清亮时，即马上研究改进。该制度因是工友自觉制定，故执行颇为顺利。公益榨油厂工友，经过学习职工运动指示精神，生产亦逐步走上了正规，人员虽已减少，生产效率仍保持原数量，工友亦能主动工作。管理原料的薛廷春怕潮籽不好打，自动选择干籽，保证了每日多榨花籽五百斤。朱文格时刻检查机器，发觉齿轮的齿长，为了不误工连夜修妥，一月内已打夜班三次。一旬内曾因机器发生故障，停工半日，但仍榨花籽九万三千八百二十六斤，每日保持万斤左右。大通汽车公司工友，在胜利形势鼓舞下，加紧工作。运送北上干部时，因车破修不好，未出车的工友全体要求加夜班，过去上班总是慢腾腾的，现在不但按时上班，而且打下班钟还不走。都要把活作的告一段落后才下班。全区除个别厂外，对工运精神均已深入贯彻，订立了劳动制度，健全了职工会的组织。在经营管理上，一般的都注意了成本计算，马头里油厂过去榨花籽是估计，现在执行过秤，并实行按日造成本计算。工益瓷厂采购原料注意了成色，经常计算，并与辛集、宁漳等地建立起联系，及时了解行情。如复昌宏记、冀南印刷厂等厂，均将劳力分了班次；面粉厂分夜班、白班，第二日比较生产量，结果查出日夜班相差五百五十九斤，于是生产少的赶紧努力追上，生产因之提高。为了作好今年大生产准备，各厂均已拟定生产计划。马头里油厂已采购花籽八十余万斤，花生籽十四万斤，修理好机器一部。过去日榨花籽四、五千斤，添设机器后，每日可榨花籽八千斤以上。缺点是普遍的存在着不重视工人福利事业的现象，今后应提起注意。
