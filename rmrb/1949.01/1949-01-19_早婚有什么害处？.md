To the Editor:
　　I am a cadre working on women's affairs. In five villages in Xingtang County, I found sixty-four cases of early marriage. I also heard from more familiar cadres that "in Huolu County, an eighteen-year-old girl married a three-year-old 'daughter-in-law' in order to divide the land; in Yi County, there are also marriages of girls aged twelve to fifteen." There are many similar examples. What exactly are the harms of early marriage? How should the leadership pay attention to dealing with these issues?
　　　　　(Jun)
　　Answer: The Marriage Law stipulates that "marriage between men and women shall be based on the principle of freedom, abolishing all feudal arranged and bought marriages, and prohibiting child brides," and clearly stipulates that "the marriage age shall be 20 for men and 18 for women." Those who marry before the legal age should be stopped. Why is this so? There are three reasons: First, both men and women are children, not qualified as adults, and their physical development is incomplete. Early marriage not only affects physical development but also affects the physical and mental health of future generations. Second, early marriages are mostly arranged by parents or third parties. Because the individuals lack independent will, there is no freedom of marriage to speak of. Therefore, when the men and women grow up and their knowledge increases, they become dissatisfied with their marriage, and suffer from emotional discord. Some, due to the constraints of feudal ideology, commit tragic suicides because of divorce. Third, marriage is a major event in life. Because children's will is weak, they cannot fully understand the principles of freedom and independence in marriage. Therefore, if not handled carefully, it will increase the suffering of both men and women and affect production. Marrying at the legal age, on the one hand, implements the marriage policy, and on the other hand, allows farmers to have a happy family life.
　　The leadership should seize the solution of the above problems and prevent them from being left to their own devices.
　　1. Universally publicize the harms of early marriage, so that children, young people, and parents deeply understand the harm of early marriage, and improve the masses' understanding of the policy.
　　2. Women cadres should go to the countryside to gain an in-depth understanding of the pain and harm of early marriage in many aspects, and educate the masses with practical and vivid examples.
　　3. Conduct long-term ideological education for cadres and the masses, universally and systematically publicize the marriage policy, summarize experience, correct deviations, and strengthen leadership in places where certain old marriage systems (early marriage, arranged marriages) still exist, break shackles, and properly handle existing problems. Actively and effectively prevent and avoid possible problems.
　　The implementation of the marriage policy in various regions must be combined with the central task, so as not to let it be left to its own devices or become a state of no leadership or anarchy.

### 早婚有什么害处？

　　早婚有什么害处？编者同志：
    我是一个做妇女工作的干部，在行唐县五个村发现六十四个早婚的。又听比较熟习的干部谈：“获鹿县十八岁的姑娘，为分土地嫁给一个三岁的女婿；易县十二岁至十五岁结婚的也有”。类似这样例子很多，早婚到底有什么害处呢？这些问题领导上应怎样注意处理呢？　　　　　
　　　（钧）
    答：婚姻条例规定是：“男女婚姻以自由为原则，废除一切封建的包办和买卖婚姻制度，禁止童养媳”，并明确规定：“结婚年龄男子须满二十岁，女子须满十八岁”，如不到法定年龄结婚者，应加以制止。为什么要这样做呢？原因有三：一、男女双方都是儿童，不够成人资格，身体发育不完全，早婚不仅影响身体发育，而且影响后代的身心健康。二、早婚多是父母包办或第三者包办的，因本人缺乏独立意志，根本谈不到婚姻自由自主，因此，男女双方当成人长大见识增长之时，对他或她的婚姻发生了不满，由于感情不合而痛苦，也有的因离婚受到封建思想束缚，会造成悲惨的自杀等事件。三、婚姻本是人生一件大事，因儿童的意志薄弱，不能完全了解到婚姻自由自主的原则，因此不慎重处理，即会增加男女双方痛苦，影响生产。如到法定年龄结婚，一方面执行婚姻政策，另方面会使农民有美满幸福的家庭生活。
    以上问题，领导上应抓紧解决，不使自流。
    一、普遍宣传早婚害处，使由儿童到青年以及家长深刻了解早婚之害，使群众对于政策的认识提高。
    二、做妇女工作的干部们，下乡时应从多方面深入了解早婚痛苦与害处，以实际生动例子教育群众。
    三、向干部群众进行长期思想教育，普遍的有计划的宣传婚姻政策，总结经验，纠正偏向，对尚存在着某些旧的婚姻制度（早婚，买卖婚姻）的地方，应加强领导，打破束缚，适当的处理现存问题。主动有效的防止及避免可能发生的问题。
    各地进行婚姻政策，必须和中心工作结合，不使之自流或成为无领导无政府状态。
