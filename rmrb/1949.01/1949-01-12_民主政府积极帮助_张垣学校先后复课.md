　　Democratic Government Actively Helps
　　Zhangjiakou Schools Reopen One After Another
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou Telegram] Under the active help and support of the People's Government, Zhangjiakou's cultural and educational work has rapidly recovered. After the Military Control Commission arranged for the resumption of classes and specifically resolved the funding and most pressing grain and fuel problems for all schools in the city, all primary and secondary schools have reopened one after another. As of now, out of the city's seven secondary schools, with the exception of the private Sai Bei Middle School which has not yet opened, six schools including Chahar-Mongolian Normal School, Teachers' Middle School, Zhangjiakou Normal School, Girls' Normal School, Animal Husbandry Vocational School, and Yangzheng Middle School, as well as the majority of the city's forty-plus primary schools, have reopened. In order to solve the difficulty of lacking teachers at Chahar-Mongolian Normal School, the Municipal Education Bureau has appointed four teachers to teach at the school. Because we correctly implement the cultural and educational policies, the majority of teachers, staff, and students are content in their positions and enthusiastic about learning, and the school order is good. In terms of student activities, temporary student self-government associations have been quickly organized in various schools to maintain order. After the Municipal Middle School reopened on the 28th, more than 80 percent of the students had returned to school. Under the leadership of the student self-government association, the students automatically formed six groups to assist our propaganda activities, such as street propaganda, washing away the Fu bandit slogans, and carrying out recreational activities. The atmosphere in the schools is completely new, and the students are eager to make progress and are studying in high spirits. They say, "The old things must be abandoned, and new knowledge must be absorbed." In order to supply the cultural nourishment to the people of the city, the Chahar branch of Xinhua Bookstore has shipped in a large number of books and magazines and has started business. People from all walks of life are coming to buy them in an endless stream. In particular, Chairman Mao's works and various policy books are selling the fastest. The first branch of the Municipal People's Education Center has been established and opened on New Year's Day. The Municipal Library is actively preparing to open. The Qingfeng, Xin Zhongguo, Xin Xin, and Yumin four old theaters and the Qingquan Cinema have all officially started business before the 30th. On the third day of Zhangjiakou's liberation (the 25th), Qingfeng Theater specially performed six programs such as "Heroes' Meeting" to celebrate the regaining of Zhangjiakou and held a joint celebration with the Liberation Army. The Old Opera Joint Association was also formally established on the 25th.
