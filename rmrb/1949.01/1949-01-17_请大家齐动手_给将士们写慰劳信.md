　　Let's All Get Involved
　　Write Letters of慰劳 to the Soldiers
　　Workers in all factories, teachers and students in all primary and secondary schools, cadres in all rural areas and government organizations:

　　The soldiers at the front have recently brought us a series of great victories. In addition to cheering and applauding, we must also pay them the highest and most sincere respect. Therefore, we suggest that everyone get involved and write letters of慰劳 to the soldiers who are bravely fighting the enemy at the front. Write them enthusiastically and kindly. Put our every beating heart onto the paper, so that our soldiers, after receiving these encouragements, will fight even more bravely.

　　请大家齐动手
  　给将士们写慰劳信
    各工厂工人们，各中小学师生们，各农村、机关干部：
    前方将士们最近又给我们带来了一连串的大胜利。我们除了欢呼鼓掌外，一定还要向他们致以最崇高、最忱挚的敬意，因此我们建议大家一齐动手来写，给正在前方英勇杀敌的将士们写慰劳信，一定要热烈的、亲切的写。把我们每颗跃动的心搬到纸上来，让我们的将士们得到这些鼓励后，战斗得更勇敢。
