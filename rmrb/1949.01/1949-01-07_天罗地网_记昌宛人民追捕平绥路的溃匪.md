    ——A Record of the People of Changping and Wanping Counties Pursuing and Capturing the Remnants of Defeated Bandits from the Ping-Sui Railway
    Song Dejian, Ping Zhaoji, Wei Futong

On December 11th, the bandit troops of Fu Zuoyi's Provisional 3rd Army were utterly routed by our forces and fled in disarray along the Ping-Sui Railway. Gao Zhenhu, the bandit army's deputy division commander, led two battalions and fled into the territory of Changping and Wanping's First District that very night. Through the pursuit and capture by our village cadres, militia, men, women, old, and young, the deputy division commander and 169 officers and soldiers under his command, including the political director of his regiment, were all taken prisoner. We captured a total of 87 machine guns and rifles from Fu Zuoyi’s bandit army. Below are a few heroic and vivid examples:

    At dawn that day, three gunshots rang out outside Futaicun Village. Militia members Fu Changfeng, Fu Changlu, and four others rushed to the edge of the village to investigate. They saw a large, dusty group of people heading towards the village, and determined that they were fleeing enemies. The militia members raised their guns and fired three shots head-on. The enemy panicked instantly and scattered into two groups, fleeing towards Qingbaikou and Taizimu Villages. However, they did not run far. Near the bridge outside the village, a group of enemies were intercepted by the militia and taken prisoner. After another round of pursuit, they obtained two more warhorses. On another route, militia members Li Zhuangliang and two others suddenly appeared before more than ten scattered bandits who were searching and looting the people's property in Shanpu Village. They used their guns to hold the bandits at bay, shouting for them to surrender their weapons. The bandits, unable to resist, obediently handed over their guns. Fu Wanzheng, the head of Futaicun Village, followed with a hand grenade. He saw two soldiers struggling to flee not far ahead. He rushed up and shouted, "Where are you running? Surrender your weapons and you will not be killed!" The two soldiers were exhausted and hungry, knowing that running was useless. They turned around and surrendered their guns. Immediately, they escorted the prisoners back to the village in triumph. They gathered more people and captured a rotating machine gun. Some women went outside the village to shout and cheer, confusing the enemy, while the militia pursued the scattered bandits. Some even directly participated in the pursuit of the enemy.

    Li Zhengbin, a primary school teacher in Zhuanghuwa Village, was patrolling outside the village early in the morning when he saw a group of lost enemies hiding in a cave not far from the village to escape the wind. He led four students, armed with a hand grenade, and quickly arranged a siege position against the enemy. He deliberately shouted loudly, "First company, spread out to the left! Second company, spread out to the right! Third company, prepare to charge!" He personally ran to the cave entrance, raised the hand grenade, and asked, "Surrender or not?" The enemy answered in a panic, "Don't shoot, don't shoot, we surrender." The teacher then ordered, "Two of you with machine guns and rifles, come out first with your guns on your backs." The first two enemies with machine guns and rifles came out of the cave. Seeing that there was no one else, they asked, "Where is your team?" The teacher replied, "Mind your own business! If you don't surrender your weapons, I will order the firing." The students shouted in coordination from behind the surrounding fortifications. The enemy heard that there were indeed people around and, not knowing the details, handed over their guns one by one. The teacher held the machine gun and quickly removed the bolts of all the remaining guns, taking them with him. The prisoners carried the empty guns and were escorted back to the village. On the way, the four students repeatedly asked the teacher for guns, and the prisoners realized they had been deceived. After the prisoners returned to the village, they saw that the people did not make things difficult for them and even gave them food, they were very moved and voluntarily told the people about the machine gun parts buried in the cave, which were found intact.

    The weapons of the Qingbaikou Village militia had been taken to the front by those supporting the front lines. Village cadres Wang Yonglin, Tian Deqing, and eight others were determined that, even though they were empty-handed, they should look for opportunities to capture the enemy outside the village. After leaving the village, it so happened that seventy or so remnants of the enemy had just passed by, and a few tired soldiers were very close to them. Wang Yonglin rushed ahead and started talking to them, "Old comrades! Are you tired? Come to the village for a meal and rest before continuing." The soldiers were all paying attention to Wang Yonglin's speech, not realizing that the cadres behind him were simultaneously taking action and seizing their weapons. Wang Yonglin said to the disarmed prisoners, "Come into the village, there's water if you're thirsty, and food if you're hungry." The pseudo-deputy division commander, Gao Zhenhu, was very close to them, extremely tired and hungry, and could hardly walk any further. He simply said to our village cadres, "I'm too tired and hungry, I'm not going anywhere. I'll go back to the village and have some food first." He was escorted back to the village along with the other prisoners. After Wang Yonglin and the others seized the weapons, they desperately pursued the large group of soldiers. Because they were familiar with the terrain, others were sent to climb the mountain to intercept them. The fleeing enemy heard gunshots from the mountain and, thinking they were surrounded, panicked. Wang Yonglin then persuaded the enemy, "There are our troops blocking the front and our pursuers in the back. You can't escape, and resistance will only mean certain death." The enemy company commander wavered and asked him, "What responsibility do you bear? How many troops do you lead?" Wang Yonglin answered alertly, "I am the village head, leading more than two hundred people." At the same time, rifles were fired from the mountain, and more than seventy enemies immediately surrendered. We captured seven rotating machine guns and twenty-six long and short guns.

    The large group of fleeing enemies had just passed through Xiamaling Village, with the vanguard no more than twenty steps away from the village, when five militia members intercepted the rear of the enemy and launched an attack. In three minutes of combat, five enemy guns were captured, and sixteen enemy soldiers were captured alive. When the militia members continued to pursue the enemy, five cadres from Taizimu Village arrived to cooperate. Two enemy soldiers were driven into a ditch, unable to go any further, and surrendered.

    The people were extremely happy after each village captured weapons, and they were talking about the stories of suppressing and capturing the fleeing enemy on the streets and in the alleys. They used the captured weapons to arm themselves and continued to pursue the enemy in an organized manner. In addition to setting up哨所 watch posts in each village, the people of Futaicun Village often sent people to carry guns up the mountain to search for remnants of the enemy. The cadres and people of Taizimu Village patrolled the road day and night, not allowing a single fleeing enemy to slip past. One captured soldier of Fu Zuoyi's army asked the village head of Futaicun Village in surprise, "How dare you ordinary people fight us! How are you so brave?" The answer was: "Our people here have never been separated from the Eighth Route Army. The people are the Eighth Route Army, and the Eighth Route Army is the people. When you flee into the liberated areas, it's like entering a heaven and earth net, impossible to escape!" Once, scattered soldiers passed through the area while our troops were pursuing them, Fu Changxian, a fifteen-year-old child from Futaicun Village, lay in ambush under the earthen steps at the edge of the village and shot at the enemy, several prisoners exclaimed in surprise: "Look, such a young child dares to shoot a gun!" Other children replied: "Hmph! Not only can he shoot guns, but he can also capture prisoners!" The village head of Qingbaikou Village told the captured pseudo-division commander about the situation: "Soon, they will come down from Nankou, and we will soon take Beiping!" The pseudo-division commander said: "It is impossible to liberate Beiping! There are many troops concentrated there (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's bandits)!" Several children nearby disagreed with this statement: "What's the use of concentrating troops! You were concentrated too, but even without our army, the people 'picked you up'. What 'ability' do you have?" The pseudo-division commander was left speechless.

    ——记昌宛人民追捕平绥路的溃匪
    宋德兼　平兆吉　魏甫通
    十二月十一日，傅匪暂三军被我打得狼狈不堪，纷纷从平绥路上溃下来到处逃命。匪军副师长高振虎带了两个营，连夜窜到我昌宛一区境内。经我各村干部、民兵、男女老幼群众追剿捕捉，该副师长和其团政治主任以下官兵一百六十九人，一齐当了俘虏。我缴获傅匪军机、步枪共八十七支。下面是几个英勇生动的具体事例。
    当天拂晓时分，傅台村外连响三枪。民兵傅长丰、傅长禄等六人就赶到村边侦察，只见黄查查的一大群人朝着村中走来，断定是逃窜中的敌人。民兵端起枪来，迎面连揍三枪，顿时敌人慌做一团，一下跑成两岔，分别向青白口、太子木二村方向夺路逃命。可是跑不多远，在该村村外的大桥附近，一班敌人便被民兵卡住，当了俘虏。再追打一阵，又得了两匹战马。另路民兵李庄良等三人，突然出现在山铺村搜抢群众财物的十多个散匪面前。他们用枪将散匪们逼住，连喊缴枪，匪军来不及还手，驯服地都交出枪来。傅台村长傅万政拿一手榴弹随后赶出村外，只见前面不远，两个匪兵正在吃力地奔逃，他便赶上去大声喊道：“往那里跑，缴枪不杀！”两个匪兵又累又饿，知道跑也无用，便转过身来举枪投降。随即押着俘虏得胜回村，再次纠集别人出来，又缴转盘机枪一挺。有些妇女在民兵们追捕散匪时，便到村外嚷叫助威，迷惑敌人。个别的还直接参加了追击敌人。

    庄户洼村的小学教员李正彬，大清早在村外巡逻，望见一班迷失方向的敌人，钻进离村不远的土洞中避风。他便领了四个学生，拿着一颗手榴弹赶去，很快布置了对敌的包围阵势后，便故意高喊：“一连左边散开！二连右边散开！三连拉开火线，准备冲锋！”他亲自跑至洞口，高举手榴弹发问：“缴枪不缴？”敌人慌忙答话：“别打，别打，我们缴枪。”教员又发命令：“把枪大背着先出来两个。”带机枪步枪的两个敌人首先出洞，一看并无别人，便问：“你的队伍呢？”教员答话：“别管闲事！如不缴枪，我就下令开枪。”小学生们都在周围掩体后面喊话配合。敌人听见周围确实有人，不摸底细，一个个将枪交出。教员抱着机枪，迅速将其余枪拴一一卸下，自己带着，俘虏扛着空枪被押回村。路上四个学生，口口声声向老师要枪，俘虏们才知道受骗。俘虏回村后，见群众并不难为他们，并让他们吃饭，很为感动，自动把埋藏在土洞内的机枪零件告诉群众，便完好无缺地找了回来。
    　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×　　　　×　　　　×
    青白口村民兵的武器被支前的人带着去前方了，村干王永林、田德青等九人打定主意，虽然赤手空拳。也应到村外寻找机会捕捉敌人。出村后，恰巧七十余名残敌刚刚过去，几个走累的匪兵却离他们很近。王永林抢先赶去和他们拉话：“老总！累不累？到村吃点饭歇歇再走。”匪兵都注意着王永林讲话，不提防被后面的几个干部同时下手，夺了他们的武器。王永林对缴械的俘虏说：“进村吧，渴了有水，饿了有饭。”伪副师长高振虎离他们很近，疲饿已达极点，实在难以再走，便索性对我村干说：“又累又饿，我也不走了，回村先吃点饭再说。”便和其他俘虏一同被押回村。王永林等缴获武器后，拚命地又向大伙匪兵追去。由于地形熟悉，另派别人爬上山拦截。逃敌听见山头打枪，以为中了包围，吓得没了主意，王永林便向敌人劝说：“前面有我们的军队拦堵；后面又有我们的追兵，逃是逃不脱的，抵抗只有白送命。”敌人的连长动摇了，问他：你负什么责任？带领多少队伍？”王永林机警地回答：“乡长，带领二百多人。”同时山上步枪连连打来，七十多个敌人立即缴机投降。我缴获转盘机枪七挺，长短枪二十六支。

    逃跑的大伙敌人刚从下马岭村过去，先头部队离村不过二十步远，五个民兵就把敌人队尾卡住，对敌人展开攻击。战斗三分钟，缴匪枪五支，十六个匪兵被活捉。民兵们继续追击敌人时，太子木村干部五人赶来配合，两个匪兵被赶到一个沟内，无法再走，驯服的当了俘虏。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    各村缴得武器后，群众高兴极了，街头巷尾都在谈论着剿捕逃敌的故事。他们更用缴到的武器武装起自己来，有组织地继续追随敌人。除各村均设岗哨外，傅台村群众时常有人扛枪上山搜查残敌。太子木村的干部和群众更是昼夜不离马路巡罗，不使一个逃敌溜了过去。一个被俘的傅匪惊奇地向傅台村长发问：“你们老百姓就敢打我们哪！怎么这样胆大？”回答是：“我们这里老百姓和八路军就没分着家，老百姓就是八路军，八路军也是老百姓。你们逃进解放区，好象入了天罗地网一般，万难逃脱！”一次散兵过境，部队正在追剿，傅台村十五岁的儿童傅长显，伏在村边土阶下，嘭、嘭的射击敌人，几个俘虏吃惊的说：“你看，这么大小孩子还敢放枪！”别的儿童回答：“哼！别说放枪，还能捉俘虏呢！”青白口村长对被俘的伪师长讲形势：“快了，南口下来了，我们很快动手拿北平！”伪师长说：“解放北平不可能！那里军队（指蒋傅匪）可集中呢！”旁边几个小孩不同意这种说法：“军队集中管‘球’用！，你们倒是集中着的，不用我们军队，光老百姓就把你们‘拾夺’了。你们有啥‘能耐’？”驳得伪师长哑口无言。
