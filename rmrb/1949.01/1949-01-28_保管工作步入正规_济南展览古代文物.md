Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th. The Shandong Provincial Government's Ancient Cultural Relics Preservation Committee recently held an exhibition of ancient cultural relics in the city. The exhibition venue is located at the Provincial Library on the shore of Daming Lake. The exhibits include more than 320 ancient celebrity calligraphy and paintings, 30 kinds of precious and rare books, more than 30 pieces of bronzes from the Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties, more than 250 pieces of ancient porcelain from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, more than 100 pieces of ancient jade, more than 300 ancient coins such as "Di Bu," "Huo Bu," and "Dao Bu," and several boxes of oracle bones. Among them, the Zhou Dynasty bronzes, Cai Yuanding's "Xishan Reading Notes" from the Song Dynasty, and Huang Pilie's collection of the "Former Han Dynasty Book" from the Qing Dynasty are the most precious. Visitors come in an endless stream from morning to night. Since its official establishment in July last year, the Shandong Ancient Cultural Relics Preservation Committee has reorganized the ancient books, ancient coins, ancient jade, and celebrity calligraphy and paintings collected from Jiaodong and Binbei, bringing the preservation work into line with standards. After the liberation of Jinan, Comrade Wu Zhongchao, director of the Ancient Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, and the staff of the committee, sometimes risking enemy planes bombing and strafing, worked hard to protect cultural relics without any slackening. Within two months, they have sorted out more than 50,000 books and hundreds of kinds of the finest calligraphy, paintings, inscriptions, rubbings, bronzes, and porcelain. The committee has also tried its best to collect and sort out various cultural relics with historical significance and preservation value.

　　保管工作步入正规
  　济南展览古代文物
    【新华社济南二十四日电】山东省政府古代文物保管委员会，日前在本市举行古代文物展览会。展览会场设在大明湖畔省立图书馆。展览品中有古代名人书、画三百二十多幅，珍藏善本书籍三十种，三代、秦、汉铜器三十余件，宋、元、明、清各代古瓷二百五十余件，古玉一百余件，镝布、货布、刀布等古钱三百余枚，并有甲骨数匣。其中以周代铜器，宋版蔡元定西山读书记，清代黄丕烈所藏的前汉书等最为珍贵。参观者从早到晚，川流不息。山东古代文物保管委员会自去年七月正式成立后，即将前在胶东、滨北各地所收集的古书、古钱、古玉和名人书、画等，加以整理，使保管工作步入正规。济南解放后，古代文物保管委员会主任吴仲超同志及该会工作人员，有时冒着敌机轰炸扫射的危险、努力保护文物，不稍懈怠。在两个月时间内，即已整理出书籍五万余册，书、画、碑、帖、铜、瓷最精品三百数十种。而对于其他稍有历史意义和保存价值的各种文物，该会也都尽力收罗整理。
