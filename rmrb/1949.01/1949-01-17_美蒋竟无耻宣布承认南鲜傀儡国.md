Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Reports from various sources: After the Soviet Union withdrew all its troops from North Korea on December 25th last year, the United States, which refused to withdraw its troops from South Korea, under the condemnation of public opinion, its Department of the Army announced a deceitful plan on December 28th to withdraw one-third of its troops. However, three days later, its State Department spokesman shamelessly announced that "it cannot be stated when the withdrawal of US troops from Korea will be completed." On January 1st, the US government openly violated the will of the Korean people and announced its recognition of the South Korean puppet regime it had fostered. The Kuomintang government, a running dog of the United States, also shamelessly recognized the Syngman Rhee puppet regime on the 4th.

　　美蒋竟无耻宣布承认南鲜傀儡国
    【新华社陕北九日电】各方报导：苏联于去年十二月二十五日从北朝鲜撤退了全部驻军之后，拒绝从南朝鲜撤军的美国，在舆论谴责之下，其陆军部于十二月二十八日乃发表了骗人的撤军三分之一的计划。但三天后，其国务院发言人即厚颜无耻地宣布“不能说明美军之撤离朝鲜于何时完成”。至一月一日，美国政府更公开违反朝鲜人民的意志，宣布承认其一手扶植的南朝鲜傀儡国。美国走狗国民党政府也跟着于四日对李承晚傀儡国作了无耻的承认。
