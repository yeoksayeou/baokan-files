Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: Regarding the 1949 production plans for various areas in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, as of the end of October, 27 copies, including those from districts and counties, had been completed on time and submitted to the Border Region Government. This reflects a new atmosphere in which Party and government leading organs in various counties are paying attention to enforcing discipline after the CCP Northwest Central Bureau and the Border Region Government called for improving leadership and increasing work efficiency. After initial study by the Construction Department of the Border Region Government, it was discovered that most of the plans were unrealistic, exhibiting the defect of "planning for the sake of planning," and that their essence was an error of empiricism. Among these plans, the plans of Ansai and Qingjian counties were good. They generally conformed to the specific conditions of the two counties and provided the higher-level government with reliable information for specifically guiding the correction of plans in the respective counties. When mentioning methods for completing agricultural and sideline production next year, the Ansai County plan first emphasized coordinating with the current land registration and determination of land rights, publicizing land reform and production policies, and resolving leftover issues from land reform in a timely and appropriate manner to encourage farmers to engage in joint production, etc. The plan also put forward opinions on issues such as tenancy, agricultural tax, and burdens based on the county's situation. These are all good. The main shortcoming of the county's plan lies in its failure to study how to organize mass labor and animal power to realize the production plan, based on the fact that more than 1,000 people died from diseases between the summer and autumn of this year, leading to a reduction in rural labor. The Qingjian County plan comparatively thoroughly analyzed the specific conditions of the county's cultivated land, grain yield, and people's consumption, and based on this, put forward the tasks of agricultural production. It was also able to propose opening up 3,000 mu of wasteland across the river in the coming spring to compensate for the local deficiencies of little cultivated land and thin soil quality, based on the experience of residents along the Yellow River going to the opposite bank to open up wasteland and increase production. In the cotton planting plan, it was able to make relatively realistic estimates of cotton seeds, cotton production, and mass needs based on this year's situation. The main shortcoming of the county's plan is its failure to clearly point out how to implement various policies related to developing production in villages where land has been adjusted.

In contrast to the above two counties, the plans of most counties were unrealistic, being either too low or too high, due to a lack of sufficient understanding and analysis of the actual production situation and the various conditions for carrying out production in their respective counties. For example, the suggestion by Suide County to organize one-third of the county's farmers to participate in small-scale voluntary mutual aid next year is a clear example of lagging behind the actual production situation. In the 1944 production, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid had already reached one-third of the county after government calls and organization. Small-scale voluntary mutual aid has been carried out almost every year. Last year, due to the destruction by bandits and the impact of natural disasters, farmers lacked means of production, and small-scale voluntary mutual aid became even more common, with the number of farmers participating in mutual aid approaching half of the county's farmers. The county's leaders failed to fully understand this existing foundation, nor did they understand the needs and level of awareness of farmers after land reform, and thus formulated a plan that lagged behind reality. The cotton planting plan of Mizhi County is an unrealistically high plan that is difficult to achieve. The county plans to expand the cotton planting area to more than 14,200 mu next year, while the total cotton planting area in the past two years was only 4,000 mu. This plan was obviously proposed simply based on the comprehensive figure of 1.5 jin of cotton allocated per capita for the entire county, without pointing out the various conditions for realizing this plan. For example, according to next year's expansion plan, a total of more than 80,000 jin of cotton seeds will be needed. The highest estimate of cotton seeds harvested in the past two years is only more than 52,000 jin, and the plan did not propose other solutions for the shortfall. In this respect alone, this plan is already a mere formality due to insufficient means of production. In addition, the plan did not propose solutions to other relevant production conditions (such as cotton field soil quality, labor, animal power, experience, and differentiating different conditions in different regions), which also makes it easy for the plan to fail.

The Construction Department of the Border Region Government has now studied the plans of fifteen counties and given detailed replies to help the counties revise or rewrite their production plans according to the actual situation and the needs of farmers. The Construction Department pointed out that county governments should currently more actively lead winter production in rural areas, carry out ideological preparation among cadres, and carry out material preparation among farmers in order to smoothly launch next year's great production movement.

Editor's Note: In order to realize Chairman Mao's call for "production to increase by an inch," various places in North China are formulating production plans for 1949. We are now publishing the advantages and disadvantages pointed out by the Construction Department of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia after preliminary study of the production plans of various counties as a reference for specific leadership of production in various places.

### 要充分分析各种条件生产计划应切合实际　陕甘宁边府具体帮助各县改进领导

　　要充分分析各种条件生产计划应切合实际
  　陕甘宁边府具体帮助各县改进领导
    【新华社延安二十六日电】陕甘宁边区各地一九四九年的生产计划，截至十月底止，已有包括分区、县的二十七份按时订出，呈送边府。此为中共西北中央局、边区政府号召改进领导，提高工作效率后，各县党政领导机关注意执行纪律的新气象。这些计划经边府建设厅初步研究后，发现多数计划不切实际，表现着“为计划而计划”的缺点，而其本质，则为经验主义的错误。在这些计划中，安塞、清涧两县计划是好的，它们大体上符合于两县具体情况，并给上级政府提供了具体指导各该县订正计划的可靠情况。安塞县计划中提及完成明年农业、副业生产的办法时，首先强调要配合现在进行的土地登记、确定地权等工作，宣传土地改革与生产政策，及时适当解决土地改革遗留问题，鼓励农民合伙生产等。计划并依据该县情况，提出对租佃、农业税及负担等问题的意见。这些都是好的。该县计划之主要缺点，在于未根据该县本年夏秋间曾因疾病死亡一千余人，引起农村劳动力减少这一情况，研究如何组织群众劳力、畜力以实现生产计划。清涧县计划中比较周密地分析了本县耕地、粮食产量、人民消费等具体情况，据此提出农业生产的任务，并能根据本县沿黄河居民至对岸开荒增产的经验，提出明春过河开荒三千亩，以弥补当地耕地少、土质薄的缺陷。在植棉计划中，对棉籽、棉花产量、群众需要等，能根据今年情况，提出了比较接近实际的估计。该县计划之主要缺陷，是未能明确指出在该县经过土地调剂的乡村应如何执行各项有关发展生产的政策。
    与上述两县相反，多数县份的计划则因对本县生产实际情况及进行生产的各种条件缺乏充分了解与分析，因而制订出过低或过高的不切实际的计划。例如绥德县提出明年组织全县三分之一的农民参加小型自愿变工，即是一个落后于生产实际情况的明显例子。该县在一九四四年生产中，经过政府号召、组织，参加变工的农民已达全县三分之一，小型自愿变工几乎每年都在普遍进行。去年因胡匪摧残和天灾影响，农民缺乏生产资料，小型自愿变工更为普遍，参加变工的农民已接近于全县农民的半数。该县领导者未能充分了解此原有基础，也未了解土地改革后农民的需要与觉悟程度，因而制订了落后于实际的计划。米脂县的植棉计划，则是一个难于实现的过高计划。该县计划于明年扩大植棉面积至一万四千二百余亩，而过去两年植棉面积总和仅为四千亩，此项计划显然只是简单地根据全县人口每人平均配量棉花一斤半的综合数字提出，而未能指出实现此一计划的各种条件。例如按照明年增植计划，即共需棉籽八万余斤，过去两年所收棉籽最高估计仅有五万二千余斤，不足之数，计划中亦未提出其他解决办法。仅就此项而言，是项计划即已因生产资料不足而徒具形式，加之计划中未提出解决其他有关生产条件（如棉田土质、劳力、畜力、经验、以及区别各区不同条件等）的办法，亦易使计划落空。
    现边区政府建设厅已研究了十五个县的计划，给予详细批答，以帮助各县按照实际情况与农民需要，修改或重订其生产计划。建设厅指出：各县政府目前应更积极领导农村进行冬季生产，在干部中进行思想准备，在农民中进行物质准备，以便顺利开展明年的大生产运动。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　
    编者按：为实现毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，我华北各地纷纷制订一九四九年生产计划。兹特刊载陕甘宁建设厅初步研究各县生产计划后所指出的优缺点，作为各地具体领导生产的参考。
