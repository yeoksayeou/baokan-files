　　Guangming Factory Sets Plan
  　Learning "Carry the Revolution Through to the End"
  　Workers Guo Bichen and Wang Wenzao Promoted to Section Chiefs
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Guangming Factory recently reorganized its Study Committee and decided to conclude the original study of "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and "On Internationalism and Nationalism" before this week. After the conclusion, a test will be held. The new study will begin next week. Specific regulations stipulate that in the first phase, the first group will study political economics as the main subject, while the second and third groups will study the history of social development. In order to solve problems and review biases during the study period, the Study Committee decided to hold meetings once a month. The third group has a lower level of culture and theory, so it was decided to adopt a lecture method. The first phase of the new study plan is scheduled for three months. (Wei)
    [Shijiazhuang News] In the midst of a heated production competition, the workers of the Guangming Factory are celebrating the New Year with unparalleled excitement. The factory has also announced the promotion of foremen Guo Bichen and Wang Wenzao to the positions of chief and deputy chief of the factory's engineering section. The Third Department held a special meeting to congratulate them on their new appointments. In the competition bulletin, a comrade wrote an article entitled "Congratulations to Foremen Guo and Wang on Their Promotion to Section Chiefs." He first explained that in "the old society, we workers could only ever be workers," but "now that the Communist Party has come, we workers not only have security in our lives, but also have improved our status in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture." He then said, "This is the first time that a worker from our factory has become a section chief, which shows the significant improvement in our workers' thinking and abilities under the leadership of the Communist Party, giving us such an opportunity to learn leadership." Finally, he criticized individual employees who do not seek progress and even ridicule others' progress, saying, "This kind of thing often happens in the repeated awards and model worker promotions, which is an evil trend, and we must promote righteousness and overcome evil!" According to reports, Comrades Guo Bichen and Wang Wenzao are both old workers with twenty or thirty years of experience in the Guangming Factory. They usually work with exceptional care, and especially since the liberation of the city, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they have shown their boundless loyalty to the people's cause. They have also been among the top performers in every award evaluation. The factory's blackboard bulletin has repeatedly praised them. In a certain task, in order to complete the task, they voluntarily worked overtime for twenty-four hours and never complained about their work. They are foremen, but they personally work alongside other workers and even apprentices. This time, their promotion by the factory is unanimously considered to be a reward they deserve.

　　光明厂定出计划
  　学习“将革命进行到底”
  　工人郭弼臣、王文藻升任科长
    【石家庄讯】光明厂于日前改组了学委会，决定本星期以前把原来学习的“将革命进行到底”及“论国际主义与民族主义”结束，结束后并将举行测验，新的学习自下星期一开始，具体规定在第一阶段第一组学习主科为政治经济学，第二、三组学习社会发展史，学委会为了解决在学习期中的问题和检讨偏向，决定每月举行会议一次，第三组文化、理论水平较低，决定采取讲授办法。新的学习计划的第一阶段定期三月。（唯）
    【石家庄讯】在热烈的生产竞赛中，光明厂的职工们正以无比兴奋的心情欢度新年，厂方更在这时宣布提升工长郭弼臣、王文藻为该厂工程科正副科长。第三部特别开了一个会来祝贺他们履新。在竞赛快报上，一位同志写了一篇“贺郭王二工长升任科长”的文章，他首先说明在“旧社会我们当工人的永远只有当工人”，而“现在共产党来了，我们工人不仅在生活上有了保障，而且在政治经济文化各方面的地位也提高了。”接着他说：“我厂工人当科长还是第一次，这说明了在共产党领导下我们工人在思想上能力上的显著提高，使我们有了这样的机会来学习领导。”最后他批评个别不求进步还要讥笑别人进步的职工同志，他说：“这种事在屡次奖评及模范职工升级的事情中常常发生，这是一种邪气，我们必须发扬正气克服邪气！”按郭弼臣与王文藻两同志都是光明厂二、三十年的老工友，平素工作异常精心，尤其是本市解放以来，在中国共产党领导之下，对人民事业表现了他们的无限忠诚。每次评奖，他们也都名列前茅。该厂黑板报曾数度提出表扬。在某次工作中，为了完成任务，他们曾自动加班二十四小时，并且对工作也从无怨言，他们是工长，但他们都亲身动手和其他工友甚至学徒在一起作活，这次他们被工厂提升，群众一致认为这是他们应得的酬劳。
