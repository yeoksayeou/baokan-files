How I Wrote "Song of the Cotton Mill Girl"
　　Zhu Guifang
Note: This article was written by a fifteen-year-old female worker. "Song of the Cotton Mill Girl" was published in this newspaper on January 17th.

　　I didn't have any sisters when I was little, and my parents loved me very much. They sent me to school when I was nine. When I was eleven, my mother died, and when I was thirteen, my father also died, leaving me all alone with no one to care for me. I went to live with a relative, but they didn't let me go to school anymore. I started working at the age of thirteen, twelve hours a day. I was so tired, and when I got home, I had to keep doing chores. I was oppressed all day long. I would try to read at home in my spare time, but they wouldn't allow it. After the People's Liberation Army came, they rescued me from the fire pit. I left my relative's house and studied hard, and people helped me make progress and helped me learn. I embarked on a bright path. I knew that only the Communist Party could save me from oppression. I knew that the Communist Party works for the oppressed people. The Communist Party is even closer to me than my parents; they educated me very well. So I support the Communist Party. I want to study wholeheartedly and learn humbly. I will work hard in the factory and produce more to support the front lines and avenge those who are oppressed. I am a child who has come through struggle. I know the suffering of oppression. I am much more advanced now than I was at home.

　　I wrote this "Song of the Cotton Mill Girl" from my heart, with the help of Comrade Xin Daming. When Comrade Xin Daming came to this factory, I didn't know him at first. He ate with us, and I didn't know what he did. Later, he asked me, "What's your name?" I said, "My name is Zhu Guifang." He said, "What section do you work in?" I said, "In the fine spinning section." He went to my machine to learn how to piece the threads together. That's how we met, but we weren't very familiar yet. One time, during a meal, I said, "The days are passing so quickly, and no one is helping me study. I'm wasting my time every day. What should I do?" He said, "If you want to study, I can help you." I said, "Really?" He said, "Really!" He asked me, "What time do you get off work?" I said, "I start work at seven in the morning and get off at three in the afternoon." He said, "Okay, come to my place at seven o'clock this afternoon, and I'll be waiting for you. I'll help you study." He said, "Write a draft and let me see it." So I showed him my diary, and from then on, we became very familiar. Whenever I had nothing to do, I would find him to teach me. He helped me very well.

　　One time, he asked me to come to his house. I went, and he said, "The New Year is coming soon! Our factory is going to put on a play. Let's write a song about the things in our factory." We discussed it and came up with the idea for the song, which is about how the winders and the operators work actively in the section competition, get the red flag, and how happy they are. After we had the idea, we started writing. He said, "The fine spinning frame is very long, so let's say, 'A fine spinning frame is long, so long.'" I said, "A fine spinning frame has four hundred spindles, so let's say, 'Four hundred spindles are spinning busily.'" Then, I would say something, and he would write it down. That's how we wrote it. How the three operators are active, how the winders help the operators piece the threads after they finish winding... These are all things I see in the fine spinning section every day, and they are things I can do every day, so we wrote it very quickly. In no time, we finished writing the song.

　　我怎样写出“纱厂女工歌”
    朱桂芳
    按：此文是十五岁女工所作，“纱厂女工歌”已在一月十七日本报发表。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    我从小没有姊妹，父母看我很亲。九岁上叫我上学，到十一岁上，母亲死了，到十三岁上，父亲也死了，光我一个人，没有人关照我，跟着一个亲戚家，到他家里，就不叫我上学了。十三岁上就上了工，一天十二小时，困的不行，回家还不停的做这做那，一天到晚受着压迫，我抽空再回家看书，他们也不叫。到解放军来后，把我救出了火坑，我从他们家里出来，自己好好的学习，也有人帮助我进步，帮助我学习，自己也走上光明的道路。我知道只有共产党，我才不受压迫，我知道共产党是为受压迫的人民办事，共产党比我父母还亲，教育的我很好，所以我拥护共产党，我要一心一意的学习，虚心学习，在厂里要好好地生产，生产多了，支援前线，还给那受压迫的人们报仇。我是经过斗争出来的孩子，我知道受压迫的苦难的，我现在比在家里进步多了。
    我写的这个“沙厂女工歌”，是从我心里想出来的，也有辛大明同志帮助我。辛大明同志来到这个厂里，开头我不认识他，他和我们在一块吃饭，我也不知道他是干什么的，后来他就问我：“你叫什么名字？”我说：“我叫朱桂芳”。他说：“你在哪部分干活？”我说：“在细纱。”他就到我车上去学接头，就这样认识了，但还不很熟识。有一回，在吃饭的时候，我说：“一天天过的非常快，也没有人帮助我学习，一天都把光阴给浪费了，这怎么办泥？”他说：“你要想学习，我可以帮助你。”我说：“真？”他说：“真！”他又问我：“你几点下班？”我说：“早七点上班，下午三点下班。”他说：“好吧，你下午七点到我那里去吧，我等着你，我帮助你学习。”他说：“你做一个稿子，叫我看看。”我便把我写的日记给他看，从此我和他就很熟了，我没有事了，就找他教我学习，他很好的帮助我。
    有一回，他叫我到他家里，我去了，他说：“快过年啦！咱们厂里还要演剧，我们把咱工厂里的事情，编个歌子吧。”我们商量了一回，想出这个歌子的意思，就是说络纱的和看车的，在分车竞赛中怎样积极工作，得上红旗，怎样高兴的情形。想好后，我们就编开了。他说：“细纱车很长，就说‘一台细纱车长又长。’”我说：“一台细纱车是四百个锭子，就说：‘四百个锭子转的忙。’”往后，我说说，他写写，就这样编开，三个看车的怎样积极，络纱的络完了，怎样帮助看车接头，……这个事情都是我在细纱每天看见的，也就是每天都能干到的，所以，编的很快，不一会儿就编成这个歌子了。　（转载自石家庄日报）
