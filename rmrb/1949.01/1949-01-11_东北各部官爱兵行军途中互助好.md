Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Pingjin, 4th: During the long marches of various units of the Northeast Field Army, they promoted a high degree of unity and comradely spirit, with many moving model deeds emerging. Li Qingliang, a soldier from the Seventh Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, fell ill during a march.翟长和Zhai Changhe and 陈庆珍Chen Qingzhen, soldiers from the same company, comforted him while pushing him along. When Li was too weak to walk, the deputy company commander and deputy political instructor personally carried him on a stretcher. The soldiers were moved and shouted, "Learn from the company leaders!" Everyone rushed forward to compete to carry the stretcher. When a certain unit was crossing the Daling River, which was two li wide, chest-deep, and about to freeze over, the cadres jumped into the river first to lead the way. Sun Xuanhuo, the battalion commander of a certain battalion, although physically weak, also waded back and forth twice, encouraging the soldiers not to be afraid of the cold and to strive to cross the river first. The soldiers were greatly moved and hung their guns and ammunition around their necks, holding hands, and crossed the Daling River in the swift current. Many Communist Party members carried weaker comrades across the river on their backs. The mortar company of a certain unit was also blocked by a river during the march. 連長逋仁丰Lian Zhang Burengfeng and others ignored the cold and ran into the water to rebuild a collapsed bridge, allowing the troops to pass smoothly. 田家喜Tian Jiaxi, a platoon leader of a certain company, often helped sick and weak soldiers carry guns and backpacks during the march. Once, when the team was about to pass a mountain, some soldiers were very tired and their morale was low. Platoon Leader Tian promptly encouraged them, saying, "Let's see who gets to the top of the mountain first!" The soldiers immediately started a climbing race, and the whole company quickly crossed the mountain. Every time they reached a campsite, Comrade Tian Jiaxi always let the soldiers sleep on the kang (heated platform), while he slept on the ground. When the house was too crowded, he slept on the stove platform overnight. During the entire march, the company headquarters of the Third Company of a certain division often held cadre meetings, branch committee meetings, and soldier committee meetings to study and deploy march work. During the march, the cadres set an example, endured hardship, and worked hard, while the soldiers helped and supervised each other. In the continuous half-month march, the entire company had no casualties. Therefore, the division's leading organs specially issued a commendation order, awarding the entire company a merit once, and each cadre at the班ban, 排pai, and 連lian levels a merit once.

　　东北各部官爱兵行军途中互助好
    【新华社平津前线四日电】东北野战军各部队在长途行军中，发扬高度的团结友爱精神，出现很多动人的模范事迹。解放军某部七连战士李庆良在行军途中生病，该连战士翟长和与陈庆珍一面安慰他，一面推着他走。当李实在走不动时，副连长和副指导员就用担架亲自抬着他走。战士们感动得大声高呼：“向连首长学习！”大家拥上去争抬担架。某部涉宽达二里、水深齐胸即将封冻的大凌河时，干部们首先跳下河去领头走。某营营长孙玄获虽身体较弱，但也来往涉水两趟，鼓动战士们不怕寒冷，争取首先渡河，战士们大受感动，都把枪支弹药挂在脖子上，手拉着手，在急流中横渡大凌河。有许多共产党员则背着身体较弱的同志过河。某部迫击炮连在行军途中也曾为河水所阻，连长逋仁丰等不顾寒冷，跑到水里，把一座已塌下来的大桥重架起来，使部队顺利地通过。某连一排长田家喜在行军中，经常帮助病弱战士扛枪、背背包。有一次，当队伍要通过一个山头时，有些战士走得很疲倦，情绪不振。田排长就及时进行鼓动说：“看谁先到山头！”战士们立刻掀起爬山竞赛，全连很快地翻过了大山。每到宿营地，田家喜同志总让战士睡炕，自己睡地下，房子太挤时他就睡在锅台上过夜。某师三连连部在整个行军期间，经常召开干部会、支部委员会、士兵委员会等研究和布置行军工作。干部们在行军中，以身作则，吃苦耐劳，战士们则互相帮助，互相督促。在连续半月的行军中全连无一减员。因此该师领导机关特通令予以嘉奖，并给全连记功一次，班排连各级干部各记功一次。
