　　[Report from Ji'nan] The Bailing County Party Committee, in order to break down all ideological obstacles and concerns and enable villages that have completed land reform to quickly and comprehensively launch production work, held a production symposium on December 15th with forty-four people from the first fourteen villages to complete land reform. Most of them were village cadres, and four were model laborers. The meeting adopted a group chat format and found the following problems: 1. Doubts that there would be equal division and struggle after land reform, and that people would not dare to rise up or become production models; being able to eat was good enough. 2. Village cadres looked down on production leadership: believing that production does not need leadership and fearing that leading production would delay work. 3. Not daring to buy good livestock; fearing trouble.
　　Having discovered the above thoughts, the County Party Committee then systematically explained the current situation at the conference, that in about a year the Kuomintang rule would be fundamentally defeated, and the policies and purposes of land reform. On the other hand, discussions were launched in each group, with leading cadres dispersing to each group to provide planned enlightenment and guidance.
　　1. To make everyone aware of the advantageous conditions for production today: the railway has been repaired, which can reduce many corvées, breaking the worry of being subject to service. 2. Regarding cadres leading production, it was emphasized that they should first do a good job in their own production, set an example, and then promote each household in a planned way. On the one hand, it does not delay their own production, and on the other hand, it also leads the masses in production. This reversed the cadres' thinking that they were afraid of delaying their own production. 3. To solve the idea that production does not need leadership, each person in the training class was asked to formulate a household plan, recognize the benefits of a household plan, and review the past spontaneity in production. 4. To solve the thinking of whether there will be equal division after land reform, it was proposed from re-studying the purpose of land reform and the land reform policy that "the level will not flow", explaining that everyone will be producers in the future, and without landlords, there will be no more equal division. This was specifically illustrated by the fact that middle peasants who were wrongly struggled in the fourteen villages were compensated, and their components were re-determined. Zhang Ying, a middle peasant whose thinking was the most difficult to get through, finally dispelled his concerns after this training. He said: "Looking back, I have wasted so much production in the past few years: my son wanted to make a rake, but I said I don’t know when people will take away the existing things, what's the point of making that? More than twenty buckets of the waterwheel were broken and could not be used, and I didn’t repair it. I calculate how much less I harvested!" Speaking of this, he cried regretfully, and later said: "This time my heart is clear, and I must work hard in production when I go back. Everyone will see, I will definitely build four more rooms and repair the waterwheel. I have the strength! I used to say I was poor, but it was all fake!"
　　Regarding the benefits of the household plan, after everyone's discussion, there are the following aspects: 1. It can promote the whole family to take charge and produce automatically. 2. It can promote family harmony, increase voluntary savings, and live a good life. 3. It can enable young men and women to improve their family status, stimulate production enthusiasm, and exercise young people's ability to manage family affairs. 4. It can establish a family democratic meeting system, enabling the whole family to automatically correct mistakes and work together to get rich.
　　Taking Zhang Ying as a typical example, after formulating a household production plan, everyone began to talk about various experiences in textile, pig farming, tofu grinding, powder mill opening, manure accumulation, and livestock raising, and rich knowledge in various aspects. Regarding how to lead after returning to the village, everyone decided: 1. First, get the cadres in the village to get their thinking straight and establish a temporary production committee. 2. Talk about production at the mass meeting, then study in groups, discover and solve ideological problems, and then call on people to voluntarily form production teams. When returning to the village to hold meetings, it is necessary to explain based on the ideas discovered here, specifically explain the policies, and conduct different education according to each person's different ideas, break down concerns with practical examples, and achieve that each household formulate a household plan. 3. Cadres should lead by example, first formulate a household plan, and when formulating the plan, they can absorb visits from various temporary representatives, and representatives can absorb visits from various group leaders; group leaders can absorb visits from the masses when making plans. Good typical examples should be announced and commended at the conference to create a production upsurge.
　　In order to implement this plan, the central link is still leadership: on the one hand, cadres should set an example, and on the other hand, they should check and commend the plans of each group, constantly discover problems, solve problems, create experience, and advance production, from family planning to mutual assistance.

### 推动群众迅速展开互助生产　柏乡召开生产座谈会

　　推动群众迅速展开互助生产
  　柏乡召开生产座谈会
    【冀南讯】柏乡县委为了打破一切思想障碍与顾虑，使完成土改村迅速全面的展开生产工作，特于十二月十五日召开第一批完成土改的十四个村四十四个人的生产座谈会。其中大部是村干，有四个是劳动模范。会议采取分组漫谈方式，发现以下几个问题：一、怀疑土改后还要平分、斗争，不敢上升、不敢当生产模范；够吃就算了。二、村干轻视生产领导：认为生产不用领导，怕领导生产误工。三、不敢买好牲口；怕出差。
    发现了以上思想，县委便有计划的一方面在大会上讲解了目前形势，一年左右根本上打垮国民党统治，与土改的政策、目的，另一方面在各小组展开讨论，领导干部分散到各组去，有计划的作启发诱导工作。
    一、使大家认识了今天生产有利条件：修好了铁路，可以减少许多差役，打破了怕支差的顾虑。二、对干部领导生产，强调先将自己的生产搞好，作模范，然后有计划的推动各户。一方面不误自己的生产，另方面也领导了群众生产。这样扭转了干部怕误了自己生产的思想。三、解决生产不用领导的思想，是在训练班中让每个人订按家计划，认识按家计划的好处，检讨过去生产上的自流性。四、解决土改后是否还要平分的思想，是从再研究土改目的、土改政策中提出“水平不流”，说明今后都是生产者，没有地主，就不会再平分了。并特别从十四村的错斗中农都得到补偿，改订了成份等事实加以说明。一个思想最难通的中农张英，这次受训后，也终于解除了顾虑。他说：“回想我这几年是误了好多生产：我的儿子要制一个耙，我说现有东西还不知啥时叫人家弄走，制那个干啥？水车坏了二十多个斗，不能用，也不修理，计算起来少收多少呀！”说到这里，后悔的大哭起来，后来又说：“这一下心眼里可亮啦，回去非好好生产不行。大家看吧，我一定再盖四间房，修理好水车，我有力量！以前我说穷是装的！”
    关于按家计划的好处，经大家讨论，有以下几方面：一、能推动全家分头负责，自动生产。二、能使家庭和睦增进，自愿节约，过好日子。三、能使青年男女提高家庭地位，激起生产情绪，锻炼青年人管理家务的能力。四、能建立家庭民主会议制度，使全家人自动改正错误，齐心为发家致富而奋斗。
    以张英为典型，制订了按家生产计划后，大家即开始交谈纺织、喂猪、磨豆腐、开粉坊、积肥、养牲口的各种经验，各方面的丰富知识。关于回村后如何领导，大家决定：一、首先在村干部中打通思想，建立起临时生产委员会。二、在群众大会上讲生产，再分组研究，发现与解决思想问题，然后号召自愿结合生产小组。回村开会，要根据这里发现的思想进行解释，具体说明政策，并要根据每个人的不同思想进行不同教育，以实际例子打破顾虑，达到各户都订出按家计划。三、干部以身作则，先订出按家计划，订时可吸收各临时代表参观，代表定计划吸收各小组长参观；小组长定计划吸收群众参观，好的典型的在大会上公布表扬，造成生产热潮。
    为了使这一计划贯彻下去，中心环节还是领导：干部一方面作示范，另一方面要对每组之计划作检查、表扬，不断的发现问题，解决问题，创造经验，使生产向前推进，由家庭计划更进到互助起来。
