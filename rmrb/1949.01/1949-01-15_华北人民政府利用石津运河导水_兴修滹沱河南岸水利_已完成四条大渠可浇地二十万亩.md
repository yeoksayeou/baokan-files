　　North China People's Government Utilizes the Shijin Canal to Divert Water
  　Constructing Water Conservancy on the South Bank of the Hutuo River
  　Four Major Canals Completed, Capable of Irrigating 200,000 Mu of Land

    [Our Newspaper's News] The North China People's Government has decided to utilize the Shijin Canal's water diversion route to construct irrigation projects, in order to improve agricultural production in the area south of the Hutuo River. To this end, an Irrigation Project Office was established last November. Under the plans of Chief Engineer Shi Chengzhou and Engineer Zhang Dianzhen, the office immediately seized the time to conduct canal line surveys and began preparations for construction. The first phase of the channel earthwork project was fully launched at the beginning of December, with 87 village units voluntarily contracting the work. The masses were highly enthusiastic, universally actively working because they were both building canals for themselves and increasing their winter income. Gao Guigui from Shangjing Village led his family of five in participating in the canal digging. Old Man Liu from Xili Village worked every day until 9 PM before stopping. The workers in Wang Village, Datan Village, Qian Taibaozhuang Village and other villages were well organized, and their work efficiency was particularly high, all of which were rewarded. The masses generally said: "The Communist Party and the People's Government advocate water conservancy, which is truly considerate of the people." Because the masses worked vigorously, the entire project was successfully completed within 20 days. Four major canals have been completed, with a total length of 35 kilometers, 230,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and 58,000 labor days used. It can irrigate approximately 200,000 mu of land, benefiting 57 villages in Shijiazhuang City's six and seven districts, and in the four and five districts of Huolu. It is reported that the office is already preparing materials for the second phase of the project, and construction will begin after the thaw. This includes ten sluice gates, twelve weirs, three aqueducts (a total length of 40 meters), seventy bridges, and dozens of gates, all of which are reinforced concrete structures, making it a very large project; there is also a temporary stone dam project. If time permits, efforts will be made to bring water for irrigation before summer.
