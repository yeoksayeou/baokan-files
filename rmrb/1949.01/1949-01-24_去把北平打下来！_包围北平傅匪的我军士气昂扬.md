Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Front, 22nd: Our correspondent Alan Winnington reports: To describe the atmosphere among the People's Liberation Army soldiers encircling Beiping without exaggeration is a difficult task. However, after traveling on the front lines for several days, a major impression emerges - every soldier impatiently demands the order: "Go capture Beiping."

Their spirit can perhaps be expressed by the spirit of this one soldier. This soldier got up in the middle of the night and said to his comrades that he couldn't sleep without seeing the commander. He said to them: "I dare to assert that the commander doesn't realize that if he lets us, we can take Beiping tomorrow."

This story was told at a division meeting. This meeting was convened to award medals to the heroes who had performed meritorious service in the encirclement of Beiping. Each company of this division sent representatives, and local people also sent representatives with gifts of pigs and sheep to feast the heroes.

At such meetings, there is often time for "free speech." At this time, the soldiers can express their opinions, and on such occasions, before one soldier has sat down, two hundred others stand up to demand the floor.

Everyone demanded that his company, rather than any other, be chosen for the most difficult task of attacking the walls of Beiping.

A soldier who had been captured in Beiping only four weeks earlier and then joined the People's Liberation Army said: "I suffered for three years in the Kuomintang army. Since I was dragged out of my village in chains, my whole family has died. How can I live without taking revenge!"

Another former Kuomintang soldier pleaded: "Our liberated soldiers should always be sent to the front lines in any battle. We have many advantages because we know what the Kuomintang soldiers are thinking and can debate with them and win them over to our side."

An old soldier criticized the impatience of others, saying: "We all want to fight, but many things must be considered in war. Comrade Lin Biao told us in the past that if we attacked Fengtai at a certain time on a certain day, we would be able to take it, and we did. If he orders us to attack Beiping at a certain time and place, we will know that this is the appropriate place and time."

Despite the applause for this opinion, the meeting decided to write to Generals Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen, requesting that they be given the most difficult task because this division had demonstrated a high degree of combat effectiveness.

This joyful fighting spirit permeates the People's Army. Every soldier trusts his commander and is determined to do better in battle than his comrades. They wear warm cotton uniforms and wool-lined boots and hats, and their weapons are the best in China - seized from the Kuomintang's elite American-equipped troops.

On the other hand, the Kuomintang soldiers in Beiping are trying to slip through their lines, cross the no man's land, and surrender to the People's Liberation Army. Each newcomer brings with him a wave of the Beiping garrison's declining morale.

These reluctant soldiers never wanted to fight. Most of them were dragged out of their farmhouses at night, tied up and driven into Chiang Kai-shek's army, subjected to whip training, and driven onto the battlefield.

Zhu Zhongsan ran across the lines from Beiping last night, and I met him this morning. He used to be a tailor and is still a tailor - even though he is wearing an American uniform - and nothing will make him be anything else but a tailor.

He was dragged out of his home in Jiangxi three months ago and now has only one goal - to try to go back and support his wife and family so that they don't starve to death.

Zhu looks down on the Beiping garrison. He said: "How can they fight the People's Army? Half of Fu Zuoyi's army are wives, orderlies, and the wives of orderlies, as well as new recruits like me, who only know how to eat! I've never fired a shot, I've just been filling sandbags all day."

Another newcomer who had served in the Kuomintang army for five years told me: "I don't want to stay there and wait to die. Everyone is digging bunkers, but these bunkers are pathetic because every soldier is mainly concerned about his personal safety and not about defending the city. Of course, Fu Zuoyi has a very solid city wall, but I don't think that the solidity of this city wall can stop the People's Liberation Army, either."

It is impossible to judge what kind of combat the Beiping garrison can actually conduct against the Liberation Army based solely on the opinions of surrendered soldiers. But it is certain that the Kuomintang garrison has already encountered these People's fighters in the Battle of Beiping and been forced to retreat into the city. They have no desire to meet their conquerors again, and they do not believe that this largest city wall in China can stop the army that captured Siping, Jinzhou, and Shenyang, especially since they know that the Kuomintang is finished.

So, every day more Kuomintang soldiers sneak out of the city in the darkness, bringing their weapons to the People's Army.

### 去把北平打下来！  包围北平傅匪的我军士气昂扬

　　去把北平打下来！
    包围北平傅匪的我军士气昂扬
    【新华社北平前线二十二日电】本社记者阿兰·魏宁敦报导：描述包围北平的人民解放军战士中间的气氛，而不致于有夸张之嫌，是一件难事。但是在前线上旅行数日之后，就有一个主要印象呈现出来——每一个士兵都不耐烦地要求下令：“去把北平打下来。”
    他们的精神或许可以由这一个士兵的精神表现出来。这位士兵在半夜里起来对他的同志说，不去见一下司令员，他睡不着觉。他对他们说：“我敢断定，司令员没有认识到只要他让我们做，我们明天就能打下北平。”
    这一个故事是在一个师的会议上讲出来的。这次会议的召开是为的给那些在包围北平时立了功的英雄们授勋。这个师的每一个连都派了代表，当地人民也派有代表带着欢宴英雄们的猪羊礼物前来参加。
    在这样的会议上，常常有“自由讲话”的时间。这时战士们可以表示自己的意见，而且在这种场合，一个士兵还没有坐下就有其他二百人站起来要求发言。
    每一个人都要求选择他的连而不是其他连担任攻击北平城墙这一最困难的任务。
    一位仅仅四周前在北平被俘，后来加入了人民解放军的战士说：“我曾经在国民党军队中受了三年罪。自从我被拴着拖出我的村庄以来，我全家都死光了。我怎么能活着不报仇！”
    另一个前国民党士兵恳求道：“我们解放战士在任何战斗中经常应该就被派到前线去。我们有许多有利条件，因为我们知道国民党士兵的想法，能够和他们辩论，把他们争取到我们方面来。”
    一位老战士批评其他人的不耐烦，他说：“我们大家都要作战，但是在战争中必须考虑许多问题。林彪同志过去告诉我们如果在某日某时攻击，我们就能打下丰台，而我们也果然做到了这一点。如果他吩咐我们在某时某地攻击北平，我们会知道这就是适当的地点和时间。”
    尽管这一意见遇到掌声，会议仍决定上书林彪与聂荣臻两将军，请求给他们以最困难的任务，因为他们这一个师已表现出有高度战斗力。
    这种愉快的战斗精神弥漫在人民的军队中。每一个战士都信任他们的指挥员，并且决心在战斗中比他的同伴做得更好。他们穿戴着暖和的棉制服，和衬着羊毛的靴子和帽子，他们的武器是中国最优良的——由国民党精锐美械装备军手中夺来的。
    另一方面，北平国民党军的士兵则正在设法溜过他们的防线，穿过中间地带向人民解放军投诚。每一位来归者都由城里带来一股北平守军的衰败士气。
    这些不情愿的士兵从来都不愿打仗。他们大多数都是在夜间从他们的农舍被拉出来，被捆着赶到蒋介石的军队中，经受皮鞭的训练，就被驱上战场的。
    朱中三昨夜由北平穿过防线跑过来，今天早晨我遇见他。他过去是一个裁缝，现在仍然是一个裁缝——尽管他穿着美式军装——，而且没有什么会使他变成别的人，而只能还是一个裁缝。
    他是三个月前被从江西的家里拉出来的，现在只有一个目的——就是设法回去养活他的老婆和家人，使他们不致饿死。
    朱看不起北平守军。他说：“他们怎么能和人民的军队作战？傅作义的军队有一半是老婆，护兵和护兵的老婆，以及象我这样的新兵，只会吃饭！我从来没有放过一枪，整天都是装沙包。”
    另一个在国民党军队当过五年兵的来归者告诉我：“我不愿留在那里等死。每一个人都在挖地堡，但是这些地堡都很可怜，因为每一个士兵主要是关心他个人的安全，而不关心守城。当然傅作义有一道很坚固的城墙，但是我认为，这道城墙的坚固也阻挡不了人民解放军。”
    北平守军实际上能对解放军进行何种战斗，仅靠投诚士兵的意见也无法判断的。但是可以肯定，国民党守军已经在北平之战中恰恰遇到了这些人民战士，并且被迫退入城内。他们丝毫不想再遇见他们的战胜者，而且丝毫不相信这一中国最大的城墙挡得住打下四平、锦州与沈阳的军队，何况他们知道国民党是完了。
    所以每天都有更多的国民党士兵趁着昏黑由城里偷跑出来，把武器带给人民的军队。
