Jizhong, Pingjin Frontline Electricity: Reporter Liu Xiuxue reports: The Anxin and Renqiu conscripted militia labor corps are carrying out political education and cultural entertainment work at the front line station. The laborers are in high spirits, competing to earn merits and be models. The Renqiu labor corps launched the "Compare and See" and "Evaluate Merits and Demerits" campaigns, greatly improving the determination of the militia to endure hardship and complete tasks resolutely. Laborer Zhen San said, "Frontline soldiers are shedding blood and sacrificing their lives. If we don't resolutely complete our tasks, then this five-foot-tall man is just wasting his height." He wrote to the village chief, saying, "I will not go home until I complete my task, and I will not see your face until I have earned merit." The Anxin stretcher team held a merit competition meeting at the frontline station on the 10th, and everyone made a merit plan. Ma Jiaobiao's team of the third platoon and third squad's merit plan is: "Guarantee not to leave the team, take care of the wounded like brothers, follow the People's Liberation Army wherever they go, and not go home until the task is completed." The Anxin stretcher team imitated the army's "gun poems" and automatically created "stretcher poems." The poem compiled by laborer Zhang Luoheng is: "The stretcher team goes to the front line, not afraid of sacrifice to snatch the wounded, work hard to earn merit, and strive to be a Beiping company." The laborers compiled their merit plans (how to abide by mass discipline and implement new district policies) and personal experiences of combat life into popular and vivid forms. During the liberation of Baoding, Zhao Wubei, a laborer who was deafened by a bomb, recounted the mobilization at the time of this departure, the cheers of the masses along the way, and the mutual assistance and friendship of the laborers in marching and camping, and the relationship with the landlords in a "counting treasures" performance at the conference, which greatly inspired the morale of the laborers. The Renqiu militia company also received great results by using wall newspapers to promote good deeds. After leaving the team, militia member Ji Hongfu of the third company wanted to take the prisoners' shoes. After several individual education sessions, he still couldn't overcome it. Later, when he heard that his mistakes were to be posted on the wall newspaper, he became very anxious and immediately found the company commander and said, "Don't put me on the wall newspaper. I will definitely correct my mistakes and guarantee that I will not go home until the task is completed and redeem my past mistakes." The next day, he helped the landlord chop two hundred pounds of grass and had a change. Every time the wall newspaper was published, it was surrounded by a crowd of people. The wall newspaper of the first company was called "Model List." The laborers secretly said, "Let's work hard and strive to be on the Model List."

　　冀中民工在前线争取立功做模范
    【冀中平津前线电】记者刘修学报导：安新、任邱出征民兵民工团，在前线驻地开展政治教育及文化娱乐工作，民工情绪旺盛，争着立功做模范。任邱民工团先后展开“比一比”与“评功论过”运动，大大提高了民兵吃苦耐劳与坚决完成任务的决心。民工贞三说：“前线战士舍命流血，咱们要不坚决完成任务，这五尺高的汉子就算白长了。”他给村长写信说：“我不完成任务不回家，不立功不见你的面。”安新担架团于十日在前线驻地举行立功竞赛大会，每人都做了立功计划。三排三班马叫彪班的立功计划是：“保证不离队，爱护伤员象亲哥们，解放军打到哪里跟到哪里，不完成任务不回家。”安新担架团摹仿部队的“枪杆诗”自动创作“担架诗”。民工张洛恒编的诗是：“担架队上前线，不怕牺牲抢伤员，要立功加油干，争取做个北平连。”民工们都把自己的立功计划（如何遵守群众纪律，执行新区政策）与亲身体验过的战斗生活等，编得通俗生动。解放保定时，被炸弹震聋的民工赵五辈，把这次出发时的动员，沿途群众的欢送，及行军宿营中民工的互助友爱，房东关系等编了个“数来宝”在大会上说唱后，民工情绪极为振奋。任邱民兵连用墙报发扬好的，也收到很大成效。三连民兵纪红福，离队后要俘虏的鞋，经过好几次个别教育，都没克服，后来他听说要把他错误登在墙报上，他可着了急了，连忙找到连长说：“千万别叫我上墙报，我一定改正错误，保证不完成任务不回家，立功赎过”。第二天就帮助房东切了二百多斤草，有了转变。每次墙报出版后，都围着一堆人。一连的墙报名叫“模范榜”。民工们暗地都说：“咱们好好干，争取上上模范榜”。
