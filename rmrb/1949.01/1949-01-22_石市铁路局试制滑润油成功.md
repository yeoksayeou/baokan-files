　　Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau Successfully Trials Lubricating Oil
    [This newspaper] The axle lubricating oil problem, which has been a long-standing issue, has been preliminarily resolved through continuous experimentation by the workers of the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau's Vehicle Inspection Section. They successfully manufactured it using a mixture of 60% small hemp seed oil and large hemp seed oil. This type of axle lubricant is well-suited to the climate at the time, and it effectively reduces friction between the axle and the bearing.
