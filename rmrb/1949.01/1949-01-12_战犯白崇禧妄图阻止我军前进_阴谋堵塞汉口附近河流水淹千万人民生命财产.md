Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 9th: After the People's Liberation Army achieved a great victory on the Huaihai Front, Bai Chongxi was worried about the safety of Hankou. Recently, disregarding the lives and property of millions of people, he planned to block and close the river sluice gates near Hankou, turning the vast area near Hankou into a swamp in order to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing. It is reported that Bai Chongxi has ordered the puppet Jianghan Engineering Bureau to establish a special engineering office to be responsible for carrying out this heinous act, and appointed the chief of the Seventh Division of the puppet Central China "Suppression Headquarters" concurrently as the director of the engineering office. Lin Jiangming, director of the Second Military Affairs Office of the puppet Jianghan Engineering Bureau, concurrently serves as the deputy director and directly presides over the design to block rivers at Daijiashan, 30 miles northwest of Hankou, and Xinan Ferry, 20 miles northwest of Hankou, and to close the sluice gates near Hankou. Currently, famous sluice gates such as Jurong Mountain near Caidian in western Hankou have been closed. The Xinan Ferry blockage project started in December and is scheduled to be completed in one month. The required labor and materials are forcibly requisitioned from the people by the "Suppression Headquarters." More than 20,000 cubic meters of stone have been prepared. If the Xinan Ferry blockage project is completed, the floodwaters from Sui County, Anlu, Yunmeng and other places north of the Xiang River, as well as the floodwaters from Xiaogan and other places flowing into BaiShui Lake, and the waters of large and small lakes northwest of Hankou, will not be able to flow into the Xiang River and will cause flooding. At the same time, the closure of famous sluice gates such as JinYin Mountain and Jurong Mountain has blocked many rivers in various places north of the Xiang River, making it impossible to drain the accumulated water from the major floods caused by the Jiang bandits' two "suppression campaigns" in the area, which will cause even greater disasters. Bai bandit's crime has aroused great anger among the local people. If Bai bandit does not immediately stop the blockage project and open the sluice gates, the People's Liberation Army will arrest Bai bandit and all the main criminals who actively carry out this crime and punish them severely.

　　战犯白崇禧妄图阻止我军前进
  　阴谋堵塞汉口附近河流水淹千万人民生命财产
    【新华社中原九日电】人民解放军在淮海前线获得伟大胜利后，白匪崇禧忧虑汉口不保；近日不顾千百万人民生命财产，计划堵塞关闭汉口附近河流水闸，使汉口附近广大地区变成泽国，以阻止人民解放军前进。据悉：白崇禧已下令伪江汉工程局设立专门工程处负责进行这一罪恶暴行，并以伪华中“剿总”第七处处长兼任该工程处长，伪江汉工程局第二军务所主任林姜明兼任副处长直接主持，设计堵塞汉口西北三十里之代家山及汉口西北二十里新沟附近之新安渡等处河流，关闭汉口附近水闸。现汉口西蔡甸附近的侏儒山等著名水闸均已关闭，新安渡堵塞工程已在十二月开工，限一个月完成，所需工料由“剿总”强迫向人民征用，现已预备石二万多方。新安渡堵塞工程如果完成，则通襄河以北的随县、安陆、云梦等地的＠水及经由孝感等地流入白水湖的＠水，和汉口西北大小湖泊的水，均将无法向襄河流泄而泛滥成灾。同时，金银山、侏儒山等著名水闸的关闭，堵塞了襄河以北各地许多河流，使蒋匪于该区两次“清剿”所造成的大水灾，积水无法排泄，将造成更大灾害。白匪此一罪行，已引起当地人民的极大愤怒，如白匪不迅即停止堵塞工程，开放各水闸，人民解放军必将缉拿白匪及积极执行这一罪行之一切主要罪犯予以严厉惩处。
