[Taihang Telegram] The winter land reform work in Taihang, which began in early September last year and ended in mid-December, has been successfully completed in 2,042 villages out of the 6,910 villages in the region that should have completed land reform. 1,403 villages are in progress and nearing completion, and were largely completed by the end of last year. There are currently 2,351 villages yet to be addressed. It is expected that the land reform work in the entire region will be fully completed before March of this year. The Party's prestige has rapidly increased. In all villages that have undergone land reform, all classes are united as never before, and are organized to actively engage in production.

Throughout the entire winter land reform work in the region, the struggle between the two lines of anti-"Left" and preventing "Right" deviations has been consistently upheld in the implementation of policies. On the issue of completing land reform and Party rectification, the theory of stages was resolutely criticized, and the working principle of combining the completion of land reform with Party rectification was gradually clarified, and some achievements and experiences were explored.

Because the policy implementation was generally correct in most areas in the completion of land reform and Party rectification work, significant achievements were made:

(1) During the completion of land reform, compensation was provided according to policy principles to middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, and appropriate arrangements were made for landlords and rich peasants, and their class status was re-evaluated. At the same time, land, houses, and necessary means of production and living were appropriately allocated to land-poor peasants who had not fully turned over. This stabilized the rural class relations and initially eliminated the ideological concerns of the masses about getting rich through production. Therefore, the unity of the masses of all classes and their enthusiasm for production have generally increased. For example, buying livestock, building houses, and making plans for prosperity. In winter production, they are actively organized to go out to collect firewood, engage in sideline occupations, collect manure, and accumulate fertilizer. All this has fundamentally changed the turbulent situation before May last year, and has also fundamentally changed the masses' hesitation towards production before August.

(2) In the completion of land reform, temporary people's representative conferences were consolidated and established. Democracy was implemented throughout the entire movement, enabling the masses to realize from their own experience that only organized and guided democracy is true democracy, fundamentally overcoming the tendency of extreme democratization and anarchism, and laying the foundation for the rural democratic system.

(3) Party rectification was combined with the land reform movement. The policy thinking of Party members was improved during the completion of land reform. Due to the correct reliance on the leadership of the branches, the leadership ability of the branches was greatly improved and strengthened. A democratic style was established, and the weapons of criticism and self-criticism were used to eliminate class dissidents and degenerates within the Party with the assistance of the masses. The ideological style of Party members was transformed, the Party was consolidated, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was strengthened. Therefore, the Party's prestige in the countryside has rapidly increased. After Party rectification, the enthusiasm of Party members for work has increased, and they are eager to improve themselves, so their enthusiasm for learning is particularly high. For example, many rural Party members automatically requested to live in schools, read documents, and buy Party constitutions. These great achievements will lay a solid and firm foundation for future work of all kinds, especially for increasing production this year.

　　坚持反“左”防“右”批判了阶段论观点
  　太行结束土改获显著成绩
  　党的威信增长各阶层团结积极生产
    【太行电】太行冬季的结束土改工作，从去年九月初开始至十二月中旬止，全区应结束土改的六千九百一十个村庄中，已胜利完成的共二千零四十二个村；正在进行将要结束的一千四百零三个村，这些村庄去年底已大体完成。现有二千三百五十一个村庄，尚待进行，大约在今年三月前，全区结束土改工作即可全部完成。党的威信迅速增长，凡是经过结束土改的村庄，各阶层空前团结，都组织起来积极闹生产。全区今冬的结束土改工作在执行政策上，始终坚持了反“左”防“右”的两条路线斗争。在结束土改与整党这个问题上，坚决的批判了阶段论的观点，逐步明确了结束土改与整党必须相结合的工作方针，并摸索到一些成绩与经验。由于绝大部分地区在结束土改与整党工作上，执行政策一般是端正的，所以取得了显著的成绩。（一）在结束土改中，根据政策原则补偿了错斗中农和适当的安置了地富，改订了成份，同时又适当的给未翻透身的少地农民，调剂了土地、房屋及必要的生产资料与生活资料。这样农村阶级关系稳定了，初步扫除了群众中生产发家的思想顾虑，因此各阶层群众的团结与生产积极性普遍提高。如：买牲口、修盖房屋、订发家计划，在冬季生产中，积极组织起来出来拾砍，搞副业，拾粪、积肥。这一切已从根本上改变了去年五月前的动荡情况；也根本改变了八月前群众对生产的犹疑状态。（二）在结束土改中，整顿建立了临时人代会。在整个运动中，自始至终贯彻了民主，使群众从切身经验中，认识了只有有组织有领导的民主，才是真正的民主，从根本上克服了极端民主化倾向与无政府状态，奠定了农村民主制度的基础。（三）在土改运动中结合了整党。从结束土改中提高了党员的政策思想。由于正确的依靠了支部的领导，大大提高与锻炼了支部的领导能力；树立了民主作风，运用批评与自我批评的武器，在群众的协助下，清除了党内的阶级异己分子与蜕化分子；改造了党员的思想作风，巩固了党，密切了党与群众的关系。因此党在农村中的威信，得到迅速的增长。经过整党，党员工作积极性提高了，迫切要求提高自己，所以学习情绪特别高涨。如：有好些农村党员，自动要求住学校，要文件看，买党章等。这些巨大的成就，将在今后的各种工作中，特别对今年生产长一寸，打下了巩固坚实的基础。
