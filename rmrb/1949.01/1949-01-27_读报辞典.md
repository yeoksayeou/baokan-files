　　Communist Party of Great Britain – The Communist Party of Great Britain was founded in 1921. Before the Second World War, it had 18,000 members. By the time the party held its 20th National Congress in February of last year, membership had increased to over 60,000. The CPGB has two members in the House of Commons. It has a significant influence in the main British trade unions. The Trade Union Alliance, one of the largest trade unions in Britain with 700,000 members, is led by Arthur Horner, a member of the Central Committee of the CPGB. The president of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with over 900,000 members, Jack Tanner, is also a member of the CPGB. CPGB Central Committee member Palme Dutt is also a member of the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress.

　　Because the Communist Party of Great Britain persists in the struggle against the remnants of fascism, demands Anglo-Soviet friendship to consolidate world peace, opposes reliance on American aid, opposes the Marshall Plan, and advocates economic and political independence, it is playing an increasingly important role in British political life. The reactionary leadership of the Labour Party has continuously launched anti-communist offensives, attempting to exclude CPGB members from the trade unions, but the broad masses of workers have gradually strengthened their trust in the CPGB and are dissatisfied with the reactionary policies of the Labour Party leaders.

　　The General Secretary of the CPGB is Harry Pollitt, the chairman of the Executive Committee is William Gallacher, and the famous political commentator, Palme Dutt, is also one of the CPGB leaders. The publications sponsored by the CPGB include the "Daily Worker," the "Labour Monthly," and "World News and Views."

    英国共产党——英国共产党成立于一九二一年。二次世界大战前有党员一万八千人；到去年二月该党开二十届全国代表大会时止，党员已增至六万余人。英共在国会下院中有两名议员。在英国主要的职工会中，有巨大的影响力量，拥有七十万人，为英国最大职工会之一的职工联盟，就由英共中央委员霍尔纳担任总书记；拥有会员九十余万的机器工业联合会的主席唐纳，也是英共党员。英共中委巴布华斯也是英国总工会最高委员会的委员之一。
    由于英国共产党坚持反法西斯残余的斗争，要求英苏友好以巩固世界和平；反对依赖美援，反对马歇尔计划，主张经济政治独立，所以在英国的政治生活中，日益起着重大的作用。工党的反动领导机关曾不断发动反共攻势，企图在职工会中排斥英共党员，但是广大的工人群众却逐渐的加强了对英共的信任，而不满意于工党领导分子的反动政策。
    英共的总书记是波立特，执委会主席是加拉彻，名政论家杜德，也是英共领袖之一。英共所主办的刊物有“工人日报”，“工人月刊”，“世界新闻与评论”。
