　　【Jizhong-Tianjin Front Dispatch】The two stations of Shangcun and Langfang on the Beining Railway's Tianjin section were swiftly restored to order throughout the city after being liberated by our army on December 14th. Before fleeing, the enemy in Langfang attempted to destroy all important buildings, but under the protection of our workers, they were unsuccessful. The first time the enemy tried to destroy the station's water tower, the workers cleverly stopped them. The second time they tried again, the workers waited at the entrance with clubs, and under the power of the worker brothers, the enemy ultimately did not dare to destroy it. None of the more than two hundred workers at the entire station left their posts. After our army entered the city, they did their best to prepare for the resumption of traffic, saying, "We cannot delay the transport of troops when attacking Tianjin." Most of the workers at Huangcun Station also stayed at their posts, with veteran worker Xu Yongfeng saying, "After the Communist Party comes, the workers should be the masters." They are urgently repairing tools to prepare for the resumption of traffic. There is a large-scale radio station southeast of the station, and the staff have steadfastly guarded it, also intact, and it resumed operation on the 21st of last month. Workers from the Huangcun Telecommunications Section have gone to repair the power lines to Langfang. The Langfang Post Office is now in communication with Anci and other places, and telephone workers are stepping up their work, already connecting with Wanzhuang, Anci, Weishanzhuang, and other places. The agricultural, vocational, normal, and Rotary schools at both stations only suspended classes for half a day on the 15th and resumed classes in the afternoon. In order to solve the current livelihood difficulties of railway employees and school faculty, the government has allocated 7,262,000 catties of grain as temporary living expenses for them.

　　廊房等车站秩序恢复
  　工人学生复工复课
    【冀中平津前线电】北宁路平津段上黄村、廊房两车站，在十二月十四日为我军解放后迅速恢复了全市秩序。廊房敌人在逃窜前企图破坏一切重要的建筑物，在我工人的保护下，没被敌人破坏。敌人第一次要破坏车站水塔的时候，工人们巧言阻止了他们，第二次又图破坏，工人们手持棍棒在门口等着打敌人，在工人兄弟们的威力下，敌终没敢破坏。全站二百多工人，没有一人离开职位。在我军入城后，他们极力筹备通车；并说：“打天津我们不能误了运送军队”。黄村车站工人亦大部留站工作，老工人徐永丰说：“共产党来了以后，工人即该当家了”，他们在紧急修理工具准备通车。该站东南方有一规模大的电台，职员们坚强的看管，亦完好无损，于上月廿一日已开工。黄村电务段工人已去修理通廊房的电线，廊房邮局现已与安次等处通邮，电话工人正在加紧工作，已与万庄、安次、魏善庄等地通话，两车站的农业、职业、简师、扶轮学校仅十五日停了半天课，下午随即复课。政府为解决铁路员工，及学校教职员当前的生活困难，已拨粮七千二百六十二万斤作为他们临时的生活费用。
