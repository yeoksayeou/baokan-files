[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] Currently, there are two major problems in the trade sector of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region: one is the difficulty in exporting native products, and the other is the insufficient adjustment of supply and demand. Both of these problems indicate that trade work is not keeping up with the victorious development of the Liberation War. The native products that Hebei-Shandong-Henan must export, with larger yields, are straw braid, fox pelts, and black dates. Last year, trade companies purchased 4,000 bundles of straw braid (each bundle weighing from 40 to 200 catties; the lighter the weight, the better the quality, and the higher the price), but only 2,000 bundles have been exported so far, and the remainder cannot be exported. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the annual export of fox pelts from Jining alone reached 4 million pieces. Last year, trade companies planned to purchase 300,000 pieces, but only 20,000 of the 50,000 pieces purchased have been exported, and the remainder cannot be exported either. This year's black date production is over 6 million catties. Trade companies have purchased 800,000 catties, and the remainder is still stockpiled in the processing workshops of the masses, with none exported to date. The reasons for the difficulty in exporting are: first, the nearby enemy-occupied cities such as Jinan, which used to be directly involved in their export, have lost their role as export outlets after liberation; and new export outlets have not yet been opened. Second, going to new export outlets requires passing through other liberated areas, but the requirements of each liberated area for goods exchanged for exports are different, and no proper solution has yet been jointly discussed. In addition, regarding the export of straw braid to Tianjin, after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' currency reform, the value of the legal tender depreciated rapidly, and no one wanted foreign exchange. Coupled with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' blockade of goods transported out of Tianjin, it was not easy to transport goods back even after exchanging them with drafts. The above reasons do not mean that the liberation of enemy-occupied cities has created difficulties for us; rather, they indicate that our trade work is not keeping up with the needs of the victorious development of the Liberation War. Trade work has failed to open up new export outlets in advance of the changes in the situation, and the liberated areas through which the new export outlets pass have not been able to negotiate and resolve import and export regulations in a timely manner, which has temporarily hindered exports. Trade companies are now actively seeking solutions and have sent personnel to the East China Liberated Area to discuss and seek their opinions on relaxing the scale of goods exchanged for exports, so that native products in this area can be exported through that area as soon as possible. Although the current difficulty in exporting is only a temporary phenomenon, some native products such as black dates and fox pelts cannot survive the summer, and the masses' demand for export must be resolved as soon as possible. In addition, if we can further strengthen the organization of transporting goods out of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit blockade zone in exchange for goods, so that the concern that the rapid depreciation of foreign exchange will not become the main difficulty in exporting, it is better to export even if it affects the price of goods exchanged for exports than not to export at all. Trade companies are also working hard in this regard. As for the insufficient adjustment of supply and demand, it is clearly reflected in prices: before the liberation of Jinan, prices in Hebei-Shandong-Henan were low in the east and high in the west because the west had the Wei River waterway. After the liberation of Jinan and the smooth flow of traffic with the East China region, a large number of homespun cloth, cotton, and food moved eastward to central and southern Shandong and Jinan, so prices became high in the east and low in the west. Later, due to the liberation of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, western materials flowed south, and prices returned to the previous state of high in the west and low in the east. This is certainly a natural phenomenon, but the insufficient adjustment of supply and demand in trade work is still evident here, which also indicates that it is not keeping up with the needs of the victorious development of the Liberation War.

　　冀鲁豫贸易工作中的两大问题
  　土产输出困难供求调剂不足
    【冀鲁豫电】目前冀鲁豫区贸易方面有两个较大问题：一个是土产输出困难；一个是供求调剂不足。二者都表现出贸易工作跟不上解放战争胜利发展的形势。冀鲁豫必须输出的土产其产量较大者为草帽辫、猾子皮、乌枣。草帽辫去年经贸易公司收买者达四千包（每包四十斤至二百斤越轻越是好货越贵），现已输出者仅二千包，所余者再输不出去。猾子皮抗战前自济宁一地输出者年达四百万张，贸易公司去年计划收买三十万张，现已买回之五万张只输出了两万张，其余也输不出去了。乌枣今年产六百余万斤，贸易公司买了八十万斤，其余尚积存在加工的群众作坊里，迄今一点也没有输出去。输出困难的原因：一是过去直接通过其输出的附近敌占城市如济南等地，解放后已失去输出口的作用；而新的输出口尚未打通。一是到新的输出口去须经过其他解放区，而各解放区彼此对输出换回物资的要求不一样，尚未共同商讨出妥善办法。此外如草帽辫之向天津输出，蒋匪货币改革后，法币贬值甚快，外汇没人要。加以蒋匪对天津外运物资的封锁，用汇票换了回货也不易运出。以上这些原因，不是说敌占城市的解放反而给我们造下了困难，而是表现出我们的贸易工作尚跟不上解放战争胜利发展的形势需要；贸易工作未能于形势变化之先及早开辟下新输出口；到新输出口所经过的其他解放区彼此间在出入口法令上也没能及早协商解决，因此才使输出暂时受到阻滞。贸易公司现正积极想办法，并已派员赴华东解放区商谈，征求其对输出换回物资放宽尺度的意见，以便本区土产得以早日经由该区输出。目前输出困难虽只是暂时现象，但有些土产如乌枣、猾子皮均不能过夏，群众要求输出这一困难须愈早解决愈好。此外如能进一步加强自蒋匪封锁区运出换回物资的组织工作，使外汇贬值太快的顾虑不致形成输出的主要困难，即使影响换回物资的价格，总比输出不了要好些。贸易公司在这方面也正在努力。至于供求调剂不足，在物价上表现得很明显：冀鲁豫的物价在济南解放前是东部低西部高，原因是西部有卫河河运；济南解放后与华东地区畅通，大批土布、棉花、食根东运鲁中、南及济南市，因而物价即变成东部高西部低；后因开封、郑州的解放，西部物资南流，物价也随之恢复到以前的西部高东部低了。这固然是一种自然现象，但贸易工作的供求调剂在这里仍显出其不足。亦即表现出跟不上解放战争胜利发展的形势需要。
