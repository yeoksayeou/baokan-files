To the Editor:
    Victory news is coming daily from different regions, and the people are overjoyed. Everyone is preparing to welcome the final victory, and the masses' enthusiasm for production and supporting the front is extremely high.

    However, our village's organization and leadership of production cannot keep up with the demands of the masses, and we cannot promptly solve the problems that need to be solved in production. This is mainly due to our weak capabilities, but the assistance from higher authorities is also too little.

    The pressing problems in our village's production that need to be solved currently are:

    1.  The Xingsheng Canal Problem: The upstream of the Xingsheng Canal originally belonged to Dongye Village, but later it merged with the Xingsheng Canal. Dongye Village has one-third of the shares, but has not been allocated enough one-third of the water. The west bank of the canal was originally wasteland. Two years ago, our village collectively reclaimed 100 mu of land on this wasteland. We built a small canal in the middle of this land, abutting the Xingsheng Canal. The water in this small canal is not enough for the wasteland to use. Therefore, we proposed to divert a part of the muddy water from the Xingsheng Canal when it is swollen. Opening a small mouth on the west side of the canal would also be considered water from one-third of the shares. However, Xingsheng Canal is unwilling, preferring to pull up the gate and let the muddy water flow into the Ye River, rather than let us use it. This issue was brought to the commissioner's office two years ago. The commissioner's office ruled that we should use the muddy water, but the Xingsheng Canal does not comply. Every time we use the water, we have to spend a lot of effort to negotiate, and the negotiation is still useless. Sometimes we just use it forcefully. We feel that it should be clarified why Xingsheng Canal does not allow us to use this part of the muddy water?

    2.  The Ji San Canal Problem: This year, the Ji San Canal did not open the gate, which caused a breach in the canal body. The flood inundated more than 70 mu of our village's crops and cut off our small canal. The masses are very sad and demand that responsibility be investigated. We have requested the canal to resolve this issue several times, but it has not been resolved yet.

    Director Xu was originally responsible for the Ji San Canal. The masses said: Director Xu's work is diligent, but his methods are not correct. He just sits in the house and writes letters to the district and county, without replying to us or solving the problems of the masses. The masses are very eager to solve this problem. How to solve it? Who will solve it? Please give a detailed answer.

    Huangtan, Dongye Village, First District, Pingshan County: Director Yang Jinhe, Fan Ke Gong. Deputy Director Kong Fan Shun. Dam heads: Tian Mao, Fan Chunhua.

### 使用兴盛渠水应该合理解决

专栏：批评与建议

　　使用兴盛渠水应该合理解决编辑同志：
    胜利消息天天由不同的地区传来，老百姓欢欣鼓舞，大家都准备迎接最后的胜利，群众生产、支前热情极高。
    但我村对生产的组织与领导，还赶不上群众的要求，不能及时给群众解决生产上必需解决的问题，这主要是我们的能力薄弱，但是上级对我们的帮助也太少了。
    我村生产上当前迫切需要解决的问题：
    一、兴盛渠问题：兴盛渠上游原是东冶村的，后来与兴盛渠合并了，东冶村有三分之一的股子，但并没有分够三分之一的水。渠的西岸原是荒滩，前年我村集体在此荒滩开地百亩，在这地的当中修了小渠，顶着兴盛渠，这小渠的水不够荒滩地使用，因此我们提出在该兴盛渠涨了水的混水，可分一部使用，渠西开小口一个，这也算三分之一的股子内的水。但兴盛渠不愿意，宁愿把闸拔了，叫混水流到冶河里去，也不叫我们使用。这问题前年曾闹到了专署，专署判决叫我们使混水，可是兴盛渠不执行，每使一次水就得要费一次劲来交涉，交涉仍不顶事，有时我们就硬使了。我们觉得应闹清楚，兴盛渠为什么不叫我们使这一部混水？
    二、计三渠问题：计三渠今年因为没开闸，把渠身蹩了一个决口，大水冲淹了我村七十来亩青苗地，把我们的小渠也断绝了。群众很伤心，要求追究责任，这问题我们已向该渠要求过几次了，至今并没有解决。
    计三渠原是许主任负责，群众说：许主任工作是努力的，就是办法不对头，他只是坐在屋子里，向区县写信，并不答复我们，也解决不了群众的问题。群众要求解决这问题是非常迫切的，如何解决？谁来解决？请详细给一答复。
    平山县第一区东冶村荒滩：主任杨金和、范克功。副主任孔繁顺。坝头田茂、范春华。
