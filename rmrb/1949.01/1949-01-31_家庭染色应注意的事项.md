Matters to Note When Dyeing at Home
    Guo Yimin
    Since the implementation of the policy of resisting Jiang and American goods and using domestic products, dyeing clothing materials has become a common household activity. However, due to poor dyeing methods, the dyed fabrics are sometimes uneven in color, or mottled, with dull colors that fade easily after only a short period of wear, making them look unsightly. Here are some things to note when dyeing at home, provided for reference, to remedy the aforementioned shortcomings.
  　●●●●●●●●●●
　　I. Preparatory Work Before Dyeing
    1. First, immerse the material to be dyed (thread or fabric) in about twenty times its volume of water, and add 3-5% alkali powder (or double the amount of lye water) in advance, and heat to boil for two or three hours (or soak for a longer time), to remove its natural fats, oils, sizing, and other impurities. After removing, wash thoroughly with water to ensure that no alkali remains on the fibers, so that they can be easily colored.
    2. If you are dyeing bright and light colors, it is necessary to pre-bleach to remove the natural pigments of the fiber, if possible. If material conditions are insufficient, pre-bleaching may also be omitted.
  　●●●●●●●●●●
　　II. Matters to Note During Dyeing
    1. Generally, when putting the fabric to be dyed into the dyeing solution, it should first be thoroughly wetted with water, wrung out of excess water, shaken evenly, and then dyed.
    2. The amount of dyeing water should be appropriate to submerge the items being dyed; too little will result in uneven color uptake; too much will waste dye and reduce the depth of the color.
    3. The temperature of the dyeing water should be low at the beginning, regardless of the color depth, and gradually heated to boiling.
    4. The dye used should be thoroughly dissolved in hot water to avoid leaving small particles, which may cause mottling. Moreover, the dye should be added in several portions during dyeing, so that the materials are added successively, and the color uptake is uniform, and the depth is consistent.
    5. When heating and boiling during dyeing, pay attention to stirring constantly to prevent the material from floating to the surface and coming into contact with air, which may cause accidental damage. Also, prevent contact with the bottom of the pot to avoid burning.
  　●●●●●●●●●●
　　III. Mordants to Be Used During Dyeing
    1. Alkali powder: Adding some alkali powder during dyeing can soften the dyeing water, so as not to affect the effectiveness of the dye. It also has the effect of slowing down the dyeing process, gradually coloring the fibers.
    2. Salt (Glauber's salt is also acceptable; if using powdered Glauber's salt, the amount can be halved): Salt has a promoting effect on dyeing and can also improve the fastness to abrasion. After the dye is added, it can be added all at once before heating.
    3. Black alum (i.e., ferrous sulfate, iron(II) sulfate), white alum, blue alum (copper sulfate), etc., are mordants, which can help the dye to develop color and mediate its dyeing power on fibers. The same dye will have different colors depending on the mordant used, or the same dye and the same mordant will have different colors depending on the amount used.
    When using mordants, they should be carried out separately from the dye liquor. The order of mordanting and dyeing can be reversed or executed in the same order, and the effect is the same, but the two should not be mixed, because when the two meet, insoluble precipitates will be produced, which will not only consume dyeing power, but also make the coloring not firm. This should be paid attention to especially when dyeing with *乌青叶* (Wuqing leaves) and oak.
    4. When dyeing with sulfur dyes, the dye should be fully dissolved with stinky alkali (sodium sulfide) before dyeing. Dyeing utensils made of enamel and copper materials should be avoided to prevent corrosion. Also, hands should not be allowed to come into contact with the dye liquor, because stinky alkali is very corrosive and can damage the skin.

　　家庭染色应注意的事项
    郭毅民
    自从执行抵制蒋美货使用土产的政策后、群众衣料的染色已成为普遍性的家庭工作了。但因染色方法不善，致染出的布匹，有的深浅不一，或是花斑，色气暗淡，色浮不入，稍穿即褪，看来很不美观。兹介绍家庭染色应注意的事项，提供参考，以补上述缺陷的万一。
  　●●●●●●●●●●
　　一、染色前的准备工作
    一、先将被染物（线或布）投入约二十倍量的水中，预告加碱末百分之三—五（或用加倍的灰水亦可），加热煮沸二、三小时（或较长时间的浸渍亦可），使脱掉其天然带有的脂肪、油污、浆质及其他夹杂物。取出后再充分用水洗涤，务使碱分不再残留于纤维上，以便易于着色。
    二、如系染鲜艳而浅淡的色相，如能办到，还须经过半漂，以消褪纤维带有之天然色素。如物质条件不足，也可不用半漂。
  　●●●●●●●●●●
　　二、染色时应注意的事情
    一、一般被染的布匹投入时，应先以水将其湿透，绞去余水，抖匀，而后染色。
    二、染水的数量，以能淹没所染的东西为适度，过少，则吃色不匀；过多，则浪费染料，而减低色相应有的深度。
    三、染水的温度，无论颜色深浅，均应由低温染起，逐渐加热至沸腾。
    四、使用的染料，应先以热水彻底化开，免留小颗粒，发生花斑，而且在染色时，染料应分数次加入，以便染物先后投入，吃色均匀，深浅一致。
    五、染色加热煮沸时，注意时时搅动，免使浮出水面，接触空气，发生意外损伤。并要防止接触锅底，以免烧焦。
  　●●●●●●●●●●
　　三、染色时要使用的助染剂
    一、碱末，染色时加入一些碱末，可使染色用水变成软水，以免影响染料之效力。再即有缓染之作用，缓缓着色纤维。
    二、食盐（芒硝亦可，如用粉状的元明粉，分量可减半）对染色有促染的作用，还可增进耐磨擦的坚牢度。在染料加完，加热前，即可一次加入。
    三、黑矾（即绿矾、硫酸铁）白矾、蓝矾（硫酸铜）等，系媒染剂，可帮助染料之发色，与对纤维之媒介染着力。同一的染料，因使用的媒染剂不同，则颜色亦异，或同一染料及同一媒染剂，而因使用分量不同，则所得之色亦有差异。
    在使用媒染剂时，应与染液分别进行，媒染与染色的次序先后或倒置执行，效果相同，但二者不宜混合，因二者相遇，即生不溶性的沉淀，不只消费染色力，且着色亦不坚牢，通常用乌青叶、橡等染色时，亟应注意。
    四、使用硫化染料染色时，应以臭碱（硫化钠）将染料充分溶化后，方能染色，使用的染具，忌用搪瓷及铜质等器具，以防起腐蚀作用。且不宜使手接触染液，因臭碱腐蚀性很大，以免伤皮肤。
