Jizhong Electric Dispatch: Cadres of all organs and people from all walks of life in the Jizhong region are enthusiastically launching a large-scale support-the-army campaign. From cities to villages, all levels of organs, schools, factories, shops, workers, farmers, women, children, and staff members are writing comfort letters and making comfort bags to comfort the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army. From directly subordinate units in Jizhong to various counties, cities, and districts, from leaders to cooks and messengers, all are investing in this upsurge of supporting the army with a high degree of revolutionary friendship. Women comrades in nurseries are taking time out from their busy schedules to make comfort bags, filling them with their own shoes, towels, soap, and other items. Wu Yinshu, a 16-year-old clerk in the Luancheng County government, donated 20,000 Jizhong currency to buy comfort goods for the comfort bags, excitedly saying, "Although this little bit of money is not much, it expresses my heart!" The Cangzhou Municipal Committee, in addition to donating 200,000 Jizhong currency saved by the organ to buy comfort goods, also made personal donations. Cadres of various organs in Ningjin County donated their January subsidies. Comrade Yang Jianzhen, secretary of the county women's committee, even donated her hygiene expenses. Teachers and students in primary and secondary schools are also excitedly joining the support-the-army campaign. Teachers and students from sixty schools in nine counties actively and enthusiastically donated and also carried out propaganda among the masses. Forty-six elementary school students in Xiaoguanting, Raoyang County, donated over 130,000 worth of comfort goods. Xu Zhan, an eight-year-old child, donated 5,000 yuan, which his grandmother had given him to buy sesame cakes, to buy comfort goods for the soldiers at the front. All teachers and students of Xinxing Village Elementary School in Lixian County promoted support for the army on market days, creating a wave of support for the army among merchants and vendors. A student from Beiguodan, a liberated farmer, took out 30,000 border currency and said to his teacher, "Our family relies on the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army to have divided houses and land. I'll use the money I was going to spend on firecrackers for the New Year to comfort the front lines!" Students at Wuqiang Normal School donated all their daily savings. Five cooks each donated two jin of rice. Twenty-five teachers in the fourteenth district of Jianguo County donated over one million yuan to buy cigarettes, toothpaste, and other comfort goods. Sixteen schools in Ningjin Chengguan, in addition to donating money, female students also made many embroidered comfort bags and filled them with snacks. More than 100 students from the 44th team of the Jizhong Party School saved their allowances to support the army. Employees of Jizhong Trading Company, Yudong Store, Yuanxing General Store, and other stores also donated in amounts ranging from 30,000 to 50,000. Dock workers, managers, and clerks in various industrial and commercial sectors in Cangxian County also enthusiastically donated. Dock workers Wang Baolin and four others used a day's wages to buy comfort goods, saying, "It's not about the amount of money, it's just to express our hearts!" Dongxing Store in Bozhen, the Chamber of Commerce, cadres, street unions, and 133 large and small merchants in the new town, medicine businesses in Anguo city, and industrial and commercial households in Baoding City and Dingxian Shenze City have also actively joined the support-the-army campaign. All staff members of the Jizhong public-private joint venture Jinji Hospital donated allowances, shoes, towels, and other items to support the army. An eighty-year-old woman in Yuanjiaqiao Village, Qingyuan County, donated 20,000 yuan from her savings from spinning thread. Many women in Raoyang and other counties, in addition to donating money, more than 80 women in Dazhuangtian Village jointly wrote comfort letters.
