　　Comforting the Wounded of the Huaihai Campaign
  　Jilu Yu Forms a慰问团
    [Jilu Yu Telegram] Wounded soldiers from our Jilu Yu region's local armed forces who gloriously sustained injuries in the Huaihai Campaign have arrived at field hospitals for recuperation. The Jilu Yu Regional Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Administrative Office, the Military Region Headquarters, and the Political Department have jointly formed a慰问团 (comfort group) and are bringing 10 million Jilu Yu currency and a letter of condolence to offer comfort. The letter reads in part: "The great Huaihai Campaign has concluded victoriously. In this campaign, you participated amidst intense artillery fire and freezing cold, using your spirit of heroic struggle to coordinate with the main force to swiftly, thoroughly, decisively, and completely annihilate the main force of the Chiang bandits, laying a favorable foundation for the liberation of all of China...The compatriots of the motherland will forever commemorate this great and heroic deed of yours." After reporting to the wounded comrades on the current victorious situation nationwide, the letter also encourages the wounded comrades to recuperate well "so that when their health is restored, they can shoulder the task of liberating all of China and carry the revolution through to the end."
