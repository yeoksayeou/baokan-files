　　【Ji Re Cha Dian】 Farmers in the Chahar North area have traditionally not engaged in winter production. This year, through persuasion and education by leading organs at all levels and specific organization to help the masses, winter production has been initially launched. The main contents are transportation and sales and workshop production. Now the trade routes between the upper and lower parts of the dam and the grasslands have begun to open up. The masses in Baoyuan and other counties run to the grasslands, pull large green salt, and go to Chicheng, Dage and other places to exchange for cloth or other industrial products to the grasslands. In Baoyuan's 54 villages alone, there are 255 households running transport and sales either jointly or individually. In Zhangbei's Da Hulun Town, there were originally only 58 vehicles running transport and sales, but recently it has increased to more than 120. They transport white flour to Duolun for resale to the grasslands, exchange it for livestock, and then resell it to various parts of the lower dam. The development of transport and sales has also driven the widespread development of oil mills, flour mills and other handicraft workshops. In Duolun's Sixth District, there are 75 newly added blacksmith shops, horseshoe nailers, shops, shoe repairers, tofu workshops, and pharmacies; Zhangbei's Da Hulun originally had only 28 various workshops, but now it has increased to more than 40. Due to the development of the milling industry, the number of stonemasons who grind stones has also increased from three households to 17. In the development of transportation and sales and workshop production, 43 households have newly added livestock and ox carts. Due to the prosperity of the town, it has also driven the masses in the surrounding twenty or thirty villages to actively collect firewood and manure (in the outer dam area, livestock manure is often used to replace firewood for burning) to Da Hulun to exchange for daily necessities. In order to solve the contradiction between production and supporting the front, small-scale labor exchange groups of three or five households have been organized in various places under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Wei Yu and other seven households in Touhao Village, Zhangbei's First District, formed a group of seven laborers, operating a flour mill, running transport and sales at the same time. Two stretcher bearers grind flour at home, two transport and sales personnel run transport and sales, and the other three transport personnel buy wheat, do odd jobs, and take care of ordinary duties at home. When the task of supporting the front comes, the two stretcher bearers go to the front, and the others can still carry out production. When it comes to profit sharing, everyone is very satisfied with the profit sharing according to work points. In order to combine production and work, the cadres of Wax Village in Duolun's Sixth District voluntarily organized themselves to take turns running transport and sales, sharing rides with each other. It is specifically stipulated that whoever drives a cart for one day will be recorded as one work point, and on the day it is his turn to be on duty, the cadres at home will take his place, also recording one work point. A cadre who goes out to push a millstone for one day or collect firewood for one day will also be recorded as one work point (Editor's note: whether such work point recording is equivalent still needs to be considered), and come back to settle accounts. In this way, the contradiction between work and production is resolved. Now, in various parts of Chahar North, the transport and sales industry and workshops are still continuing to develop.

　　察北各地贸易线路打通
  　农民打破冬闲习惯
  　积极进行冬季生产
    【冀热察电】察北地区农民向来没有冬季生产习惯。今年经过各级领导机关说服教育和帮助群众具体组织，冬季生产已初步展开。主要内容是运销和作坊生产。现坝上坝下和草地的贸易路线开始打通，宝源等县群众跑草地、拉大青盐、到赤城、大阁等地换回布匹或其他工业品到草地。仅宝源五十四村，即有二百五十五户合股或单独跑运销的。张北大囫囵镇原只有五十八辆车跑运销，最近已增加到一百廿多辆。他们把白面运到多伦转销草地，换回牲口来，再转销坝下各地。由于运销的开展，也带动起油坊、磨坊及其他手工业作坊的普遍开展。多伦六区新增铁匠炉、钉马掌的、开店的、掌鞋的、豆腐坊、药铺等共七十五家；张北大囫囵原先只有各种作坊二十八家，现在增至四十余家。因磨坊业的开展，打磨的石匠也由三户增加到十七户。在发展运销与作坊生产中，群众新添牲口牛车的即有四十三户。由于该镇的繁荣，也带动了周围二三十里村庄的群众积极打柴拾粪（坝外地区常以牲口粪代替柴火烧），到大囫囵来换日用品。为了解决生产与支前的矛盾，各地在自愿两利的原则下，组织起三五户的小型变工组。张北一区头号村魏与等七户组成一个组，七个劳动力，开一座磨坊，连带跑运销，两个担架队员在家磨面，两个运销员跑运销，另外三个运输员在家买麦子、打闲杂和负担平时勤务。支前任务一来，两个担架队员上前方，另外的人还可以进行生产。到分红的时候，按工分红，大家都很满意。多伦六区瓦×村干部为了要作到生产和工作结合，大家自愿组织起来，轮流跑运销，互相捎车，具体规定谁赶一天车记一个工，该他值班那一天，在家的干部替他值班，也记一个工。出外的干部推一天碾子，或是打一天柴火，也记一个工（编者按：这样记工是否等价，尚需考虑），回来齐工算帐。这样将工作和生产的矛盾解决了。现在察北各地，运销业和作坊等仍在继续发展。
