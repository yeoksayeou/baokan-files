　　Strengthen the Unified Leadership of Private Business Management and Production

　　To the responsible comrade of the People's Daily:

　　I am engaged in production work. Based on what I have heard and seen, I have some opinions on our economic measures. Because it concerns the entire economic construction, in addition to submitting suggestions to my direct superiors, I am also writing to the Party newspaper.

　　Before the correction of deviations (i.e., refunds) in the Taihang District, private industrialists and merchants did not dare to confront the public economy. After the correction of deviations, some people started to act recklessly. This is specifically manifested in: (1) They demand absolute freedom in business operations and production management and are unwilling to be subject to any government constraints. (2) They demand absolute freedom to appoint and dismiss employees. (3) They demand that employee wages be freely negotiated (in reality, it is a unilateral decision by the capitalists). (4) They are displaying their old tricks in the market – speculation. They played a major role in instigating the price fluctuations this year. The price fluctuations in December were deliberately initiated by these private merchants. After learning about the impending liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, they selected grain as the object of speculation (because they knew that the KMT-controlled areas lacked grain) and hoarded it unscrupulously. They also spread rumors that "prices will definitely rise when the new currency is issued" (this was discovered in both Xingtai and Handan), resulting in an overall price fluctuation. It is understood that Shijiazhuang rose by 100% in more than 20 days in December, and Xingtai rose by 80%. This is one aspect of the problem.

　　Are there any problems with our overall measures for the public economy? I am not familiar with state-owned and cooperative sectors, but as far as organ production is concerned, there are problems. As I understand it, the public economy (including organ production) holds an absolute advantage in the entire national economy. According to Xingtai statistics, the public economy accounts for 71% of the city's total economic strength. In the first district, the public economy accounts for 80% of the total economic strength. Although there is no definite information on other aspects, the proportions should not be significantly different. Especially organ production, which accounts for a considerable proportion of the urban economy. But why can't prices be effectively controlled, and instead be manipulated by the private economy, which has a smaller economic strength (although their manipulation is only temporary)? As I understand it, the reason is this:

　　Since the reorganization this spring, our organ production has formally been under the unified leadership of the Management Committee, but the Management Committees at all levels have generally not played the role they should have (objective reasons: no dedicated administrative agencies or personnel, most are part-time). This has created a tendency towards lack of leadership, blind and chaotic work, and profit-seeking. Once prices fluctuate, they cannot be controlled. Organ production is essentially national wealth (or a small public asset), but due to the lack of correct leadership, it has to some extent weakened the strength of the public economy, creating speculative opportunities for private merchants. Several price fluctuations have caused losses to the people (similar abnormal phenomena have occurred in cities such as Xingtai and Linqing). To overcome the above-mentioned dangerous tendencies, I suggest:

　　(1) Strengthen the management of private businesses and, if necessary, give appropriate treatment to a few speculative profiteers in accordance with the law. (2) Strengthen the unification of our internal forces, especially the organ production force (it is understood that the total funds of the military system alone reached nearly 200 million at the end of last year), which should be well organized to make it a powerful assistant to the state-owned economy. The first step is to solve the problem of unified leadership, establish a special agency, appoint dedicated personnel to be responsible for management, and establish a top-down administrative system. The old system no longer seems to meet the needs of the situation. Of course, it seems difficult to achieve comprehensive unification at present, but we can first unify the military and government systems separately, and then transition to comprehensive unification.

　　Only in this way can we exert our strength. Not only can we stabilize prices, but it will also be of great help to the upcoming large-scale production movement.

　　The above suggestions may not be correct, please consider.

### 加强私商管理工作统一领导机关生产

　　加强私商管理工作统一领导机关生产
    人民报社负责同志：
    我是一个做生产工作的，根据自己耳听眼见，对我们经济措施有点意见，因事关整个经济建设问题，除已向直属上级提出建议外，再写给党报。
    太行区私人工商业家，在未进行纠偏（即退补）前，他们是不敢同公营经济来对抗的。纠偏后，有些人就胡闹起来了，具体表现在：（一）业务经营与生产管理上，要求绝对自由，不愿受政府任何约束。（二）要求有任免职工绝对自由。（三）要求职工工资自由议定（实际是资方片面决定）。（四）在市场上大显其故技——投机；今年物价几度波动，他们在中间是起了主要鼓动作用。十二月物价波动就是这些私商有计划搞起的，在他们了解了平津即将解放情况后，即选定了粮食投机对象（因他们了解蒋管区是缺粮食），不择手段大肆囤集。并造谣说：“新钞一出物价必涨”（在邢台、邯郸都曾发现过），结果使物价全面波动起来。据了解石庄在十二月份二十多天即上涨百分之百，邢台上涨百分之八十，这是问题一方面。
    在我们公营经济整个措施上是否有毛病呢？国营、合作方面我不了解、单就机关生产这方面来说，是有毛病的。据我了解，公营经济（机关生产在内），在整个国民经济中，保有绝对优势：邢市统计，公营经济力量占全市总经济力量百分之七十一，一分区公营经济占总经济力量百分之八十，其他方面虽无确切了解，但在比例上说，不会有大的悬殊。尤其机关生产，在城市经济力量中是占有相当大比例的，但为什么物价不能很好掌握，反为经济力量较小的私人经济操纵掌握呢（虽然他们这种操纵仅是暂时现象）？据我了解是这样：
    我们机关生产，从今春清理后，在形式上是有了管委会统一领导，但各级管委会一般说是没有起了其应起的作用（客观原因：无专设行政机构或专管人员，大部都是兼职），造成了无领导、盲目乱干、唯利是图的偏向。一旦物价波动就不能掌握，机关生产在本质上是国家的财富（或者说是小公家），但由于缺乏正确领导，因而在某种程度上反削弱了公营经济力量，给私商造成了投机机会；几次物价波动使人民遭蒙损失（邢市、临清等城市都发生过类似不正常现象）。为克服上述危险倾向，我建议：
    （一）加强私商管理工作，必要时对少数投机奸商依法给予适当的处置。（二）加强我们内部力量统一，尤其对机关生产这部分力量（据了解，单军队系统去年底总资金额几达二亿），应很好组织起来，使其成为国营经济有力助手。这首先应解决统一领导问题，设专门机构，设专管人负责管理，建立一套自上而下行政系统。过去那套似乎已赶不上形势需要。当然，现在要做全面统一似乎有困难，但可先分军队与政权两系统来统一，再过渡到全面统一。
    这样才能发挥力量，不但可以平稳物价，即对行将到来的大生产运动也有很大帮助。
    上述建议不一定对，请考虑。
