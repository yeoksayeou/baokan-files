　　Qixian County Directly Subordinate Organs Embark on Formal Study
　　Qixian County established a study committee for directly subordinate organs on December 30th of last year. It was decided that the various organs would be divided into three classes according to their level of education. Those with higher levels would study theory, while those with lower levels of education would focus on studying Chinese language, mathematics, geography, and so on. Everyone was also encouraged to take notes during the study. After overcoming erroneous ideas such as "we can work without studying," the county party committee organs have embarked on formal study. The study within the armed forces committee was not good before rectification because some comrades believed that the armed forces committee were second-class cadres, and some even said: "Now the people being transferred are all intellectuals, we have no future." After mobilization and explanation, the enthusiasm for studying has increased.

　　淇县直属机关走上正规学习
    淇县在去年十二月三十日成立了直属机关的学委会，决定各机关按程度分成三班进行学习，较高的学理论，文化低的则着重学国文、数学、地理等。并号召大家在学习中要记笔记。县委机关在克服“不学也能工作”等错误思想后，已走上正规学习。武委会的学习在未整顿前不好，原因是有的同志认为武委会是二等干部，有的还说：“现在调动的都是知识分子，咱们没前途。”经动员解释后，学习情绪才高了起来。
