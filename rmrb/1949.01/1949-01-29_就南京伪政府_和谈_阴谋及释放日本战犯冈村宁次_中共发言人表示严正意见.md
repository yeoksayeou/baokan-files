Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government on January 26th: "A government spokesperson stated: In order to end the war early and alleviate the suffering of the people, the government has taken various measures and steps since January. On the 22nd of this month, peace talk representatives were officially appointed. Recently, the only thing awaited is for the CCP to appoint representatives and agree on a location in order to conduct negotiations. However, according to a broadcast from Xinhua News Agency in Northern Shaanxi on the 25th, a CCP spokesperson stated that while declaring a willingness to negotiate a peaceful resolution with the government, the CCP also engaged in wanton insult and used much perverse language. Furthermore, it was stated that the negotiation location could only be determined after the complete liberation of Peiping. If the CCP does not immediately appoint representatives, agree on a location, and stop military action, but instead attributes this to the so-called complete liberation of Peiping, is this not delaying time and prolonging the war? It must be known that the people of the whole country hope to eliminate the war as soon as possible, and this is already a matter of great urgency. In order to show the greatest sincerity, the government still hopes that the CCP will recognize today's events and should take saving the people as a prerequisite. Appoint representatives as soon as possible to conduct negotiations so that peace can be achieved at an early date." According to a dispatch from the Nanjing Central News Agency in Shanghai on the 26th: "Japanese war criminal, former Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, General Yasuji Okamura, was acquitted by the War Crimes Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense after a retrial on the 26th, and Judge Shi Meiyu announced the verdict at 16:00. The atmosphere in the court was tense at the time. Okamura stood at attention and listened to the verdict, then revealed a slight smile." Based on this, the CCP spokesperson expressed the following points:
　　(1) Japanese war criminal, former Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, General Yasuji Okamura, is the main war criminal among all war criminals of the Japanese invading army in China. Now that he has been acquitted by the War Crimes Military Tribunal of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, the Chinese Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army declare: This is unacceptable. The Chinese people sacrificed countless lives and property in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. Fortunately, they won the war and captured this war criminal. It is absolutely not permissible for the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government to arbitrarily declare him innocent. The people of the whole country, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic people within the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government system must immediately rise up to oppose this criminal behavior of the Nanjing reactionary government in selling out national interests and colluding with Japanese fascist warlords. We now issue a serious warning to the gentlemen of the Nanjing reactionary government: You must immediately rearrest and imprison Yasuji Okamura without delay. This matter is closely related to your current request to negotiate with us. We believe that your current actions are an attempt to cover up your reorganization of war preparations with false peace negotiations, including a conspiracy to lure Japanese reactionaries to China to slaughter the Chinese people with you. Your release of Yasuji Okamura is for this purpose. Therefore, we will never allow you to do this. We have the right to order you to rearrest Yasuji Okamura and, according to the time and place we will notify you, you will be responsible for escorting him to the People's Liberation Army. Other Japanese war criminals will be temporarily held in your custody pending disposal. Under no circumstances should they be released without authorization or allowed to escape. Violators will be severely punished without leniency.
　　(2) From the statement of the spokesperson of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government on January 26th, we learned that the gentlemen in Nanjing are so nervous, enthusiastic, attentive, and eager in demanding peace negotiations. It is said that all of this is "to shorten the war," "to alleviate the suffering of the people," and "to take saving the people as a prerequisite"; while the CCP seems to be so unenthusiastic, unenthusiastic, unattentive, and unhurried in accepting your wishes, and that "not stopping war actions" is really "delaying time and prolonging the war." We honestly tell the gentlemen in Nanjing: You are war criminals, you are people who are to be judged. We do not believe in your so-called "peace" and "public opinion." You relied on American power, violated the will of the people, tore up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched this cruel and anti-people, anti-democratic, and counter-revolutionary civil war. At that time, you were so nervous, enthusiastic, attentive, and eager that you would not listen to anyone's advice. You convened the bogus National Assembly, formulated the bogus constitution, elected the bogus president, and issued the bogus order for "mobilization to suppress the rebellion," and you were again so nervous, enthusiastic, attentive, and eager that you would not listen to anyone's advice. At that time, the official or pro-government so-called councils, chambers of commerce, trade unions, farmers' associations, women's groups, and literary groups in Shanghai, Nanjing, and major cities all chimed in, "supporting the mobilization to suppress the rebellion" and "eliminating the communist bandits," and were again so nervous, enthusiastic, attentive, and eager that they would not listen to anyone's advice. Now, two and a half years have passed, and the number of people slaughtered by you is more than several million, the villages burned down by you, the women raped, the property looted, and the living and non-living forces destroyed by your air force are countless. You have committed heinous crimes, and this debt must be settled. It is said that you are very opposed to liquidation and struggle. But this time, the liquidation and struggle are for a reason and must be thoroughly investigated, calculated, struggled, and debated. You have been defeated. You have angered the people. The people have risen up together to fight you to the death. The people do not like you, the people condemn you, the people have risen up, and you are isolated. Therefore, you have been defeated. You put forward five points, and we put forward eight points. The people immediately supported our eight points and did not support your five points. You dare not refute our eight points, and you dare not insist on your five points. You stated that you are willing to take our eight points as the basis for negotiations. Isn't that good enough? Why not talk sooner? Thus, you appear to be very nervous, very enthusiastic, very attentive, very eager, and very much in favor of "unconditional ceasefire," "shortening the war," "alleviating the suffering of the people," and "taking saving the people as a prerequisite." And what about us? Obviously, we are not nervous, not enthusiastic, not attentive, not eager, "delaying time and prolonging the war." But wait, gentlemen in Nanjing, we will become nervous, we will become enthusiastic, attentive, and eager. The war can definitely be shortened, and the suffering of the people can definitely be alleviated. Since you agree to take our eight conditions as the basis for negotiations between the two sides, you and we will have to be busy together. Implementing these eight articles is enough for you, us, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life across the country to be busy for several months, half a year, a year, or several years. I'm afraid we won't be able to finish it! Listen, gentlemen in Nanjing: The eight articles are not abstract clauses, they must have concrete content. In the short term, everyone should think carefully. The people will forgive a period of delay for this. To be honest, the people's opinion is to prepare well for this negotiation. Negotiations must be held, and whoever goes back on their word and refuses to negotiate is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, your representatives must be prepared to come. But we still need some time to prepare, and we will not allow war criminals to dictate the time for negotiations. We and the people of Peiping are doing an important job, peacefully resolving the Peiping issue in accordance with the eight conditions. Your people in Peiping, such as General Fu Zuoyi, are also participating in this work. Through the announcement of your news agency, you have already admitted that this work is being done correctly. This not only prepares a location for peace negotiations, but also sets an example for resolving the peace issues in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Guihua, Lanzhou, Dihua, Chengdu, Kunming, Changsha, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Taiwan, and Hainan Island. Therefore, this work should be praised, and the gentlemen in Nanjing should not show an insufficiently serious attitude towards this. We are consulting with various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic figures, including those in our area and those in your area, on the issue of the list of war criminals, preparing the specific content of the first condition. This list will probably be officially announced soon. Dear gentlemen, you know that until now, we and various democratic parties and people's organizations have not had time to discuss and officially announce such a list. This is something that we must ask the gentlemen to forgive. The reason is that your request for peace talks came a little late. If it had been earlier, perhaps we would have been ready. But you are not without things to do. In addition to arresting Japanese war criminal Yasuji Okamura, you must immediately arrest a batch of civil war criminals, first arresting the forty-three war criminals mentioned in the statement by a certain authoritative figure of the CCP on December 25 last year who are in Nanjing, Shanghai, Fenghua, Taiwan, etc. Among them, the most important are Chiang Kai-shek, T.V. Soong, Chen Cheng, He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Wu Guozhen, Dai Chuanxian, Tang Enbo, Zhou Zhirou, Wang Shuming, Gui Yongqing, etc. Especially important is Chiang Kai-shek. The criminal has now fled to Fenghua and is very likely to flee abroad, seeking protection from American or British imperialism. Therefore, you must quickly arrest the criminal and prevent him from escaping. You must take full responsibility for this matter. If there is an escape, it will be treated as aiding and abetting the enemy, and there will be no leniency. Do not say that you were not warned. We believe that only by arresting these war criminals can we shorten the war, alleviate the suffering of the people, and seriously do a piece of work. The existence of war criminals for even one day will only prolong the war and increase the suffering of the people.
　　(3) The above two items require a response from the Nanjing reactionary government.
　　(4) The work to be prepared by both sides for the other articles in the eight articles will be notified to Nanjing another time.

　　就南京伪政府“和谈”阴谋及释放日本战犯冈村宁次
    中共发言人表示严正意见
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据南京国民党反动政府的中央通讯社一月二十六日电称：“政府发言人称：政府为提早结束战争，以减轻人民痛苦，一月以来已作种种措施与步骤。本月二十二日更正式派定和谈代表。日来只待中共方面指派代表，约定地点，以便进行商谈。惟据新华社陕北二十五日广播中共发言人谈话，一面虽声明愿与政府商谈和平解决，一面则肆意侮谩，语多乖戾。且谓谈判地点要待北平完全解放后才能确定。试问中共方面如不即时指派代表，约定地点，又不停止军事行动，而竟诿诸所谓北平完全解放以后，岂非拖延时间，延长战祸？须知全国人民希望消弭战祸，已属迫不及待。政府为表示绝大之诚意，仍盼中共认清今日之事，应以拯救人民为前提。从速指派代表进行商谈，使和平得以早日实现。”又据南京中央社二十六日上海电称：“日本战犯前中国派遣军总司令官冈村宁次大将，廿六日由国防部审判战犯军事法庭举行复审后，于十六时由石美瑜庭长宣判无罪。当时庭上空气紧张。冈村肃立聆判后，微露笑容。”等情，据此。中共发言人表示下列诸点：（一）日本战犯前中国派遣军总司令官冈村宁次大将，为日本侵华派遣军一切战争罪犯中的主要战争罪犯，今被南京国民党反动政府的战犯军事法庭宣判无罪，中国共产党及中国人民解放军总部声明：这是不能容许的。中国人民在八年抗日战争中牺牲无数生命财产，幸而战胜，获此战犯，断不能容许南京国民党反动政府擅自宣判无罪。全国人民，一切民主党派，人民团体以及南京国民党反动政府系统中的爱国人士，必须立即起来反对南京反动政府方面此种出卖民族利益，勾结日本法西斯军阀的犯罪行为。我们现在向南京反动政府的先生们提出严重警告：你们必须立即将冈村宁次重新逮捕监禁，不得违误。此事与你们现在要求和我们进行谈判一事，有密切关系。我们认为你们现在的种种作为，是在企图以虚伪的和平谈判掩护你们重整战备，其中包括勾引日本反动派来华和你们一道屠杀中国人民一项阴谋在内，你们释放冈村宁次，就是为了这个目的。因此，我们决不许可你们这样做。我们有权命令你们重新逮捕冈村宁次，并依照我们将要通知你们的时间地点，由你们负责押送人民解放军。其他日本战争罪犯，暂由你们管押，听候处理，一概不得擅自释放，或纵令逃逸，违者严惩不贷。（二）从南京国民党反动政府发言人一月二十六日的声明中，获知南京的先生们要求和平谈判是那样的紧张、热烈、殷勤、迫切，据谈都是为了“缩短战争时间”，“减轻人民痛苦”，“以拯救人民为前提”；而感觉中共方面对于接受你们的愿望则是这样的不紧张，不热烈，不殷勤，不迫切，“又不停止战争行动”实在是“拖延时间，延长战祸”。我们老实告诉南京的先生们：你们是战争罪犯，你们是要受审判的人们。你们口中的所谓“和平”，“民意”，我们是不相信的。你们依赖美国势力，违反人民意志，撕毁停战协定和政治协商会议的决议，发动这次残酷无比的反人民反民主反革命的国内战争。那时你们是那样的紧张、热烈、殷勤、迫切，什么人的劝告也不听。你们召开伪国大，制定伪宪法，选举伪总统，发颁“动员戡乱”的伪令，又是那样的紧张、热烈、殷勤、迫切，又是什么人的劝告也不听。那时，上海、南京及各大都市的官办的或御用的所谓参议会，商会，工会，农会，妇女团体，文人团体一齐起哄，“拥护动员戡乱”，“消灭共匪”，又是那样的紧张、热烈、殷勤、迫切，又是什么人的劝告也不听。如今，过了两年半，被你们屠杀的人民何止数百万，被你们焚毁的村庄，奸淫的妇女，掠夺的财物，被你们的空军炸毁的有生无生力量，是数不清的，你们犯了滔天大罪，这笔帐必得算一算。听说你们很有些反对清算斗争。但是这一次清算斗争是事出有因的，必得清一清，算一算，斗一斗，争一争。你们是打败了。你们激怒了人民。人民一齐起来和你们拼命。人民不欢喜你们，人民斥责你们，人民起来了，你们孤立了，因此你们打败了。你们提出了五条，我们提出了八条，人民立即拥护我们的八条，不拥护你们的五条。你们不敢批驳我们的八条，不敢坚持你们的五条。你们声明愿以我们的八条为谈判的基础。这样难道还不好吗？为什么还不快点谈呢？如是乎显得你们很紧张，很热烈，很殷勤，很迫切，很主张“无条件停战”，“缩短战争时间”，“减轻人民痛苦”，“以拯救人民为前提”。而我们呢？显然是不紧张，不热烈，不殷勤，不迫切，“拖延时间，延长战祸”。但是且慢，南京的先生们，我们会要紧张起来的，会要热烈起来，殷勤起来，迫切起来的，战争时间一定可以缩短，人民的痛苦一定可以减轻。你们既然同意以我们的八个条件为双方谈判的基础，你们和我们会要一齐忙碌起来的。实行这八条，够得上你们，我们，一切民主党派，人民团体以及全国各界人民忙上几个月，半年，一年，几年，恐怕还忙不完呢！南京的先生们听着：八条不是抽象的条文，要有具体的内容，目前这一个短时期内还是大家想一想要紧，为此耽搁一段时间人民也会原谅的。老实说，人民的意见是要好好地准备这一次谈判。谈是一定要谈的，谁要中途翻了不肯谈，那是决不许可的，因此你们的代表一定得准备来。但是我们还得一些时间做准备工作，不容许战争罪犯们替我们规定谈判的时间。我们和北平人民正在做一件重要工作，按照八个条件和平地解决北平问题。你们在北平的人例如傅作义将军等也参加了这件工作，经过你们的通讯社的公告，你们已经承认了这件工作是做得对的。这就不但替和平谈判准备了地点，而且替解决南京，上海，武汉，西安，太原，归绥，兰州，迪化，成都，昆明，长沙，南昌，杭州，福州，广州，台湾，海南岛等地的和平问题树立了榜样。因此这件工作是应当受到赞美的，南京的先生们对此不应当表示不够郑重的态度。我们正在和各民主党派人民团体及无党派民主人士，包括在我们区域的和在你们区域的都在内，商量战争罪犯的名单问题，准备第一个条件的具体内容。这个名单，大约不要很久就可以正式公布出来。亲爱的先生们，你们知道，直到现在，我们及各民主党派，人民团体，都还没有来得及商量和正式公布这样一个名单，这是要请先生们原谅的。其原因，是你们的和谈要求来得稍为迟了些。如果早一点，也许我们已经准备好了。但是，你们也并不是没有事做。除了逮捕日本战犯冈村宁次以外，你们必须立即动手逮捕一批内战罪犯，首先逮捕去年十二月二十五日中共某权威人士声明中所提四十三个战犯之在南京、上海、奉化、台湾等处者，其中最主要的，是蒋介石，宋子文，陈诚，何应钦，顾祝同，陈立夫，陈果夫，朱家骅，王世杰，吴国桢，戴传贤，汤恩伯，周至柔，王叔铭，桂永清等人。特别重要的是蒋介石，该犯现已逃至奉化，很有可能逃往外国，托庇于美国或英国帝国主义，因此，你们务必迅即逮捕该犯，毋令逃逸。此事你们要负完全责任，倘有逃逸情事，必以纵匪论处，决不姑宽，勿谓言之不预。我们认为只有逮捕这些战争罪犯，才是为了缩短战争时间，减轻人民痛苦，认真地做了一件工作。战争罪犯们存在一天，只会延长战争时间，加重人民痛苦的。（三）以上二项，要求南京反动政府给予答复。（四）八条中其他各条双方应行准备的工作，另一次再通知南京。
