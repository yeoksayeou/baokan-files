　　North China People's Government Reissues Order Requiring Subordinate
　　Military, Political, and Economic Agencies to Register with Local Governments Promptly
　　[Report from this newspaper] To eliminate loopholes for sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, the North China People's Government reissued an order on the 5th of this month instructing all directly subordinate agencies of military, political, and economic organs scattered throughout the area to register with local governments promptly. The order stated: "Chiang's bandits forge official seals and use the names of organs to cover up their sabotage work. Recently, the Public Security Department of this government uncovered the following cases: Wang Xinchang, a special agent of the traitorous Fu Zuoyi, acted as a cadre of the Jizhong Liaison Department in the Hejian and Gaoyang areas for as long as two years. He established training classes, and many students have graduated. The Public Security Bureau has cracked the case. According to the confession of the suspect, he carried out various sabotage activities during Fu Zuoyi's attack on Hejian. More than 20 criminals, including Zheng Mingxing, were captured in Beiyu. They impersonated the Sixth Sub-district Independent Work Team of the Jin-Sui Military Region and operated for more than a year. After investigation, various certificates were obtained. Just as the case was about to be solved, Wang Peizhong, a henchman of Zheng, escorted Zheng away with four armed men, impersonating the Security Section of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, through the district office. Only later was it discovered that the official letter was fake. In the Ji-Lu-Yu area, 25 men and women, including He Yuzhen, were captured for impersonating the 21st Station of the East China Field Army. They operated in the Liaocheng area, established agencies, and associated with local ruffians to carry out sabotage activities. Local governments were afraid to interfere because they thought they were military agencies. Later, the intelligence agency discovered that they were indeed an intelligence organization that had infiltrated our side. The Logistics Department of the East China Field Army confirmed that there was no 21st Station. Our public security organs immediately arrested all the criminals and seized various certificates, proving that the criminals had provided the Chiang bandits in Jinan with a lot of military intelligence. The above facts show that there are serious weaknesses in the social security system in our liberated areas, which provide loopholes for Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to carry out sabotage activities. In the weak areas at the junction of the two regions, it is easier for Chiang's special agents to impersonate our personnel and act boldly, which should arouse high vigilance. In order to consolidate social security and plug loopholes, it is hereby ordered that all directly subordinate agencies (such as offices, work stations, shops, and factories stationed in various cities and towns by various organs and troops) scattered in various places should, in addition to being subject to the leadership and jurisdiction of the local government, hold a letter of introduction from the head of each agency and register their household registration with the local county and city government public security bureau as soon as possible!"

　　华北人民政府再次训令所属
  　军政经济派出机关快向当地政府登记
    【本报讯】为消弭蒋特破坏空隙，华北人民政府本月五日再次训令各军政经济机关分散各地之直辖派出机关，迅速向当地政府登记。训令称：蒋匪伪造公章，利用机关名义，掩护其破坏工作，近经本府公安部破获者即有：冀中傅匪特务王信昌充冀中联络部之干部活动于河间、高阳一带，时达二年之久。开办训练班，先后毕业学生甚多。业经公安局破获，据该犯供出：在傅匪突击河间时进行多种破坏活动。北狱破获郑明星等犯二十余人，冒充晋绥六分区独立工作队名义，活动年余，经侦察后，获证件多种，正拟进行破案时，郑特爪牙王培忠随带武装四人，冒充晋察冀军区保卫科名义，通过区公所将郑押走，事后才发现公函是假的。冀鲁豫破获何玉珍等男女二十五人，冒充华野二十一兵站，在聊城一带活动，设立机关，交结地方流氓，进行破坏活动，地方政府惧其为军队机关，不敢过问，后经情报机关侦知确为混入我方之情报组织，华野后勤部证明确无二十一兵站，我公安机关即将该犯等全部捕获，查出证件多种，并证明该犯等曾供给过济南蒋匪不少军事情报。上述事实说明我解放区社会治安制度存在着严重弱点，给蒋特破坏活动以可乘之隙，在两区交界工作薄弱地带，蒋特更易冒充我方人员，大胆活动，应引起高度警惕。为了巩固社会治安，堵塞漏洞，仰即遵照本府公安字第一号训令饬所属分散各地之直辖派出机关（如各机关部队派驻各城镇之办事处工作站商店工厂等），除必须受当地政府领导与管辖外，并应一律持各该机关首长介绍信，迅即向当地县市政府公安局登记户口为要！
