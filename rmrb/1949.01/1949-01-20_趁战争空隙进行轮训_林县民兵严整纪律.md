[Taihang News] The Lin County militia, on the front lines of northern Henan, is seizing the gaps in the war to carry out intensive rotational training. Some are active at the front, while others are training in the rear. From November 24th to December 4th, they trained 160 people in nine days, with excellent results.

At the beginning, they conducted an inspection of mass discipline. Everyone thought there was nothing wrong: “We haven’t cursed the masses, haven’t beaten the masses, haven’t stolen anything from the masses, and haven’t violated any mass discipline.” The leadership immediately asked: "Where did Li Tianxiang, of the second squad of the fourth platoon, get his rubber shoes?" Tianxiang said: "I picked them up from the roof." Everyone also said: "This doesn't count as violating mass discipline." The leadership then asked everyone to discuss: What exactly is mass discipline? Everyone said: "Don't take a needle or thread from the masses, don't take..." The leadership said: "Is a pair of shoes worth more than a needle and thread or less?" Only then did everyone understand that this was also mass discipline. But some still couldn't understand: "Everyone knows about this, so how can it be considered a violation of discipline?" The leadership then asked everyone: "Do the masses know about it?" Everyone said: "No." "Isn't not knowing the same as losing something? What else is this if not a violation of mass discipline?" Only then did everyone realize, "Oh! It's not that simple." So the leadership wrote a letter, and Li Tianxiang and a team member personally returned the shoes to the Cheng Cao village, more than ten li away, and gave them to the landlord. The village chief of that village wrote back, saying: "This small matter doesn't need to trouble your unit... This shows that the policy of the People's Liberation Army is not ambiguous at all. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can this be done."

After the inspection, some people suggested: "In the future, don't let the platoon leader worry about us. We are all people from the liberated areas, five-foot-tall men. We have already corrected deviations at home and guarantee that we will not commit any more violations." Someone said: "Everyone says they guarantee they won't commit any more violations, but words are cheap, and promises can be broken. I say it's better to set out some discipline." So the fourth company challenged the second company: "If we violate discipline again, we will carry water, sweep the yard, and sweep the streets for you." Most of the other platoons, squads, and individuals also issued challenges.

Next, while studying current affairs, it was discovered that some people were afraid of crossing the Yellow River and feared that it would take too long. The leadership immediately asked everyone to discuss. Someone said: "Chiang Kai-shek will be fundamentally defeated in about a year or so, and that's talking about the whole country. How long can a small city like Xinxiang take? Jinzhou City had 120,000 enemies, and we annihilated them in a day and a half. As long as we are prepared, it won't be a problem." Niu Fuyuan of the second platoon said: "The enemies in Xuzhou were like big sores on the body and we still cured them (liberated them). Xinxiang is just like a pimple on the face, can't we get rid of it?" After hearing this, everyone's confidence in victory increased.

Finally, everyone was asked to raise any other issues. Yang Futang said: "The county magistrate said at a meeting on the hill: 'The militia's work style is bad.' I don't understand." Niu Zhongyou of the first platoon of the second company also said: "I still don't want to do it, I don't want to be a leader, I want to be a regular soldier." Then some people complained. The leadership then asked everyone to distinguish right from wrong. Hou Zhangfu of the third district said: "In the past, we only complained about the leadership. The leadership never said anything about our actions in the village that were divorced from the masses! It is wrong to beat people randomly." Wang Liangcai said: "You don't want to be a militia member, but there are people who want to be one. Now there are militia in the village, and the special agents and bad people are still causing trouble. If there were no militia, the special agents would definitely kill us." After this discussion, some people overcame the idea of laying down their weapons.

After the training, the morale of the militia was very high. They got up every day before dawn to practice basic movements. During the day, they worked hard to do four hours of field exercises, and their sweat soaked their jackets, but they didn't rest. Li Tang had never learned before, but this time he used any terrain he could find to crawl up and down, practicing constantly. Now he is very skilled at using the terrain. The militia who were active at the front heard that the militia in the rear were learning well, and they also asked to come back to study and improve themselves. The comrades who had completed the training all asked for tasks. There was only his wife in Han Jinquan's family. He was assigned to carry water for a military family in the village. Now he was afraid that no one would carry water for the military family, so he wrote a letter to the village chief saying: "Please find someone to carry water for the military family for me, and I will pay him back when I return." This shows that after the training, the militia's political awareness has been greatly improved.

### 趁战争空隙进行轮训　林县民兵严整纪律

　　趁战争空隙进行轮训
  　林县民兵严整纪律
    【太行讯】林县民兵在豫北前线，利用战争空隙，抓紧进行轮番整训。一部分人在前边活动，一部分人在后边整训，从十一月二十四号到十二月四号，九天训练了一百六十人，成绩很好。
    开始进行检查群众纪律，大家都认为没有什么：咱又没骂群众，没打群众，没偷群众东西，没有犯什么群众纪律。领导上即提出：“四排二班李天祥那双胶皮鞋从哪里来的？”天祥说：“我从房上拾的。”大家也说：“这不算什么违犯群众纪律。”领导上即叫大家展开研究：到底什么是群众纪律？大家都说：“不拿群众一针一线，不拿群众……”领导上说：“一双鞋顶住一个针和一条线顶不住？”这一问大家才了解了这也是群众纪律。但还有个思想弄不通，认为大家都知道的事，还能算成什么犯纪律？领导上又问大家：“群众知道不知道？”大家说：“不知道”“不知道不是等于人家丢了东西吗？这不是群众纪律是啥？”这样大家才认识到，啊呀！真不简单。于是领导上写了一封信，李天祥和一个队员亲自把鞋子送回十余里的程曹村，交给房东。该村村长来信说：“这点小事不用贵部费心……这说明解放军政策一点不含糊，只有共产党领导下才能这样做。”
    检查完，有的人就提出：“今后不要叫排长替咱们操心，咱们都是解放区人，五尺高男子汉了，在家已纠过偏，保证不再犯。”有人说：“都说保证不犯了，嘴是两片皮，说后有改移，叫我说恐口无凭，还是订出个纪律才行。”于是四连向二连提出挑战：“俺们如果再犯了纪律，给你们担水、扫院、扫街”。其余排、班、个人大部也挑了战。
    接着学习时事，发现有人怕过黄河；怕时间长。当即叫大家展开讨论。有人说：“一年左右就根本上打败蒋介石了，这还是指全国说的，新乡一个小城能用多长时间，锦州城十二万敌人，一天半时间，就把他消灭了，只要咱们准备好是不成什么问题的。”二排牛福元说：“徐州敌人好象身上大疮一样还治好啦（解放的意思）新乡只不过象是脸上的风刺圪＠，还擦不了他？”这样一说，大家胜利信心提高了。
    最后又叫大家提提还有啥问题？杨福唐说：县长到圪＠上开会说：“民兵们作风坏，我想不通。”二连一排牛中有也说：“我现在还是不想干的思想，不想当头套，想拉二套”。接着一部分人发了一些牢骚。领导上就叫大家分清是非，三区侯张福说：“过去咱光瞒怨领导，咱在村上搞的脱离群众的事，领导上可没有告说过吧！乱打人是不对的”。王良才说：“你不想当民兵，可有人想当哩。现在村上有民兵，特务坏人还捣乱，如果没有民兵，非叫特务害死不可”。这样一扯，克服了一部分人放下武器的思想。
    整训后民兵情绪很高，每天天不明就起来练习基本动作，白天一股劲做四个钟头的野外演习，汗把袄湿透了，大家也不休息。李唐从前没学过，这次见一个能利用的地形就爬下起来，起来爬下，一直练习，现在利用地形很熟练了。前边活动的民兵听到后边民兵学的好，他们也要求回来学习一下，提高提高自己；整训后的同志，都要求给任务。韩金全家中只有老婆一人，在村上固定他给一家军属担水，现在怕没有人给军属担水，他给村长写信道：“你给我找个人给军属担担水，回去我还他工。”这说明经过整训后民兵政治觉悟是大大的的提高了一步。
