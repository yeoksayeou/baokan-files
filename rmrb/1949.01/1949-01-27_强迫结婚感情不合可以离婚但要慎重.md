　　Forced Marriage, Incompatible Feelings Can Lead to Divorce, But Be Cautious
　　Question: I am only seventeen years old this year. At the age of fifteen, my family arranged an engagement with a woman two years older than me. At the time, I strongly opposed it, but due to the constraints of the old society, I had to obey my parents' orders. Last March, my family wanted me to get married, and I strongly opposed it again, but to no avail. I ran away from the marriage, but my family found me and forced me to marry. The woman is a very feudal woman, and my feelings for her are very bad after marriage. In May, I joined the workforce, left home, and have not lived together or communicated since. Continuing like this is not a solution. Can I now file for divorce from the woman? Because the woman is very feudal, if she does not agree, what should I do?
　　Reader – Yuan Lin
　　Answer: Since you do not agree with early marriage and even ran away from the marriage once, and although you were forced to marry later, and your feelings are incompatible, you can persuade her to divorce you. If she does not agree, you can file a divorce lawsuit with the county government, and the county government will investigate the situation and make a judgment according to the law. But on the other hand, if your wife has no other faults, only some feudal ideas, and she is still young, she can be educated and make progress. A person has shortcomings and also has advantages, and should be viewed comprehensively. Divorce is a last resort and should be carefully considered.

　　强迫结婚感情不合可以离婚但要慎重
    问：我今年才十七岁，在十五岁时，就由家庭包办和一个比我大两岁的女子订了婚。在当时我是极力反对的，可是因为旧社会的束缚，只得听从父母之命。去年三月间，家中要我结婚，我又极力反对，结果无效，我便逃婚，可是仍被家中找回强迫结了婚。女方是一个极封建的女性，婚后我俩感情极不好，在五月间我就参加了工作，离开了家，至今仍未同居，也没通信。这样下去也不是一个办法，现在我是否能向女方提出离婚？因为女方很封建，如不同意，又应如何办呢？
　　读者——袁林
    答：你既不同意早婚，并且还逃婚一次，后虽被强迫结婚，但感情又不合，你可以劝她同你离婚。如果她不同意，你可以向县政府提起离婚诉讼，经县政府调查情况，依法判决之。但在另一方面，如果你妻没有其他过失，只是有些封建思想，她还在青年，是可以教育进步的，一个人有缺点，也有优点，应该从全面来看，离婚是不得已的事，应该慎重考虑。
