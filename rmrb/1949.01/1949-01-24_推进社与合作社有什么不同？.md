    What is the difference between a promotion society and a cooperative?

    To the Editor:
    I have two questions that I would like answered:

    First, what is the difference between a promotion society and past cooperatives? What is its relationship with us farmers? What attitude should farmers have towards promotion societies?

    Second, why are the prices of cotton and thread the same at the Pingshan City market today? My wife spun a catty of thread and only sold it for 80,000 Border Region currency today. When she went to buy cotton, cotton was also 80,000 Border Region currency per catty, which made her angry and she didn't want to spin thread anymore. Why are prices so chaotic? Why have prices been fluctuating recently? Can the government find a way to stabilize them? Please answer.

    Answer:

    First, the promotion society is the abbreviation of "production promotion society", which is an economic organization run by the government. It is not a cooperative itself, but it should lead and help the masses organize cooperatives and develop production. At present, the business of the production promotion society includes: (1) Handling loans and grain loans for agricultural and handicraft production. (2) Engaging in supply and marketing operations, directly supplying the masses with industrial products at prices lower than the market price to eliminate the intermediate exploitation of merchants, and purchasing the agricultural products of the masses at prices slightly higher than the market price. (3) Organizing mass production to solve the difficulties of the masses in terms of materials and tools necessary for production and life. (4) Helping the masses organize production cooperatives. In the past, many cooperatives or joint cooperatives generally called for shareholding with profit-sharing as the purpose, purely for the purpose of making money. This is not entirely correct. Production cooperatives can be run in this way, but it is better for supply and marketing cooperatives not to share profits, otherwise it will disperse the strength and will not be beneficial to the masses.

    Second, recently, because the People's Liberation Army besieged Tianjin and Beijing, these two large cities have a population of more than 4 million, and have been subjected to the long-term exploitation and looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The people's lives are poor, and after liberation, a large number of daily necessities need to be transported into the city to solve the living problems of the citizens. Therefore, some merchants took the opportunity to speculate and hoarded grain and cotton in large quantities in the market, resulting in an imbalance in the supply and demand of materials in the market and crowded chips, resulting in rising prices. In response, the government has taken effective measures to fight against speculative merchants, and prices have gradually stabilized during this period.

专栏：询问与答复

　　推进社与合作社有什么不同？编辑同志：
    我有两个问题请答复：
    第一、推进社与过去的合作社有什么不同？与咱农民的关系怎样？农民对推进社应抱什么态度？
    第二、今天平山城集上为什么棉花价和线价一样呢？我家里纺了一斤线今天拿到集上只卖边币八万元，她再去买棉花，棉花也是边币八万元一斤，气得她不纺线了。这物价是怎么这样乱呢？近来物价为何起波动？政府可否设法稳定？请答复。

    答：
    第一、推进社是“生产推进社”的简称，是政府举办的一种经济组织，他本身不是合作社，但是要领导并帮助群众组织合作社，发展生产。目前生产推进社的业务包括：（一）办理农业手工业生产的贷款、贷粮。（二）经营供销业务，以低于市场价格的工业品直接供给群众消费，铲除商人的中间剥削，并以稍高于市场价格收购群众的农产品。（三）组织群众生产，解决群众生产上与生活上所必需的资料与工具的困难。（四）帮助群众组织生产合作社，过去许多合作社或联社一般的都是以分红号召入股，纯粹是以赚钱为目的，这是不完全对的，生产合作社可以这样办，而供销合作社还是不分红好，不然就分散了力量，对群众是没利的
    第二、近因人民解放军围攻平津，这两个大都市拥有四百多万的人口，又是长期的处在蒋匪的榨取抢劫之下，人民生活贫因，解放后，需要大量的日用必需品运送市内，解决市民生活问题，因之一些商人借此投机，在市场上大批收购粮棉，进行囤积，造成了市场上的物资供求失调筹码拥挤，致使物价上涨。对此，政府已采取有效办法，向投机商人进行斗争，这些时物价已逐渐平稳了。
