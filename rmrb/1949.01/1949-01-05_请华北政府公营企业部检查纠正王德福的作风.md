　　Please, the North China Government Public Enterprise Department, Inspect and Correct Wang Defu's Work Style
　　A cadre of the North China Government Public Enterprise Department (located in Yangquan City, Shanxi), named Wang Defu, is from Songshan Village, Seventh District, Yi County. This person took a month's leave from the Enterprise Department to return home. During his leave, he visited his parents-in-law in Xilongmen Village, Sixth District. His father-in-law, Zhang Lianwu, was wrongly classified as a landlord. At the end of the land reform, Zhang Lianwu's confiscated property was returned, but some grain had not been fully returned. The reason for this was that Zhang Lianwu had not paid three tax levies this spring. The village cadres paid it for him, so they sold some of the grain that should have been returned to repay the spring tax levy. Wang Defu, after hearing his wife's words at home, "The cadres in Longmen Village are no good," and listening to only one side of the story from his father-in-law, was filled with anger and cursed the district and village cadres. On December 5th, he went to Longmen Village and that evening insisted that the village head, Zhao Shutian, find him a quilt, claiming that his return was to solve the problems of his father-in-law's family. The village cadres, seeing the situation and hearing that he was a cadre from the North China Bureau, wearing a military uniform, were frightened and ran away. Only the Farmers' Association Director was at home, and Wang Defu scolded him nonsensically, finally saying, "You are busy with expanding the army. I will come back in ten days and must settle the problems of my father-in-law's family." He left in a fierce manner.
　　The next day, after breakfast, as the village cadres were discussing mobilization for army expansion, Wang Defu went to the home of the Farmers' Association Director, Chang Tongsheng, again to pick a quarrel and get angry, demanding that they settle accounts for his father-in-law. The village cadres did not agree at the time, and before they could say much, he slapped the Farmers' Association Director twice before other cadres pulled them apart. Afterward, the village cadres sent him to the district. Wang Defu refused to admit any fault in the district, instead claiming that the village cadres had beaten him, arguing sophistically and arguing with the district cadres for a long time. The district cadres, seeing his bureaucratic airs and unreasonableness, sent him to the county.
　　Therefore, we especially suggest that the responsible comrades of the North China Government Public Enterprise Department investigate whether Wang Defu is a cadre of the department. For the sake of his father-in-law's problems, he does not ask about right and wrong, does not reflect his opinions to the district, but directly makes trouble with the village cadres, beats the village cadres, looks down on the district cadres, and is unreasonable with the district cadres. The leadership should give this kind of unorganized and undisciplined bad work style a good education and rectify his thinking. We hope to receive a response in the newspaper on how the problem will be resolved.

　　请华北政府公营企业部检查纠正王德福的作风
    华北政府公营企业部（住山西阳泉市）一个干部，名王德福，易县七区松山村人。此人由企业部请假回家住一个月，在假期中到六区西龙门庄探望他岳父母，他岳父张连五是一错斗户，在结束土改时，没收张连五的东西，未分的都退还了，尚有部分粮食未全部退还。其原因是今春三次征款，张连五未交出，村干部给他垫上，遂将应退的粮食卖去一部分还了春征款。王德福在家中听了老婆的话：“龙门村干部不好。”又听了他岳父的一面之词，满胸气愤，大骂区村干部。十二月五号到龙门村，当天晚上，非找村长赵书田给他找被子不可，并扬言说，这次回来，就是给他岳父家解决问题的。村干部见势不好，又听说是华北局的干部，穿着军装，吓的都跑了。只有农会主任在家，王德福不三不四的漫骂了一顿，最后说：“你们扩军忙哩，过十天以后再来，非把我岳父家的问题闹清不行。”气势凶凶地走了。
    第二日早饭后，村干部正在讨论扩军动员工作，王德福又到农会主任常同生家去找岔子生气，叫给他岳父算帐，村干部当时没有答应，言语不及，就打了农会主任两个耳光，别的干部才拉开。事后村干部把他送到区里，王德福到区里不承认自己一点错误，反说村干部打了他，强词夺理，和区干部嚷了半天。区干部看他抖着官僚架子，又不讲理，又送到县里。
    为此特建议华北政府公营企业部负责同志检查一下，王德福是不是本部的干部，此人为他岳父的问题，不问是非，有意见不向区里反映，直接和村干部大闹，打村干部，看不起区干部，和区干部横眉竖眼蛮不讲理，这种无组织无纪律的坏作风，领导上应给予很好的教育，整整思想。问题如何解决，并盼在报上答复我们。
