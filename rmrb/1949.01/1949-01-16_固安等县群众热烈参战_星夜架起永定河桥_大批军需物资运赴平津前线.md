[Hebei-Central Tianjin Frontline Telegram] With extremely high enthusiasm for supporting the front, the masses in Gu'an and other counties, through five days and nights of hard work, built a large bridge across the Yongding River in a certain area, a river that has always been difficult to bridge. Now, the Pingda Highway leads directly to the front line, completely unobstructed. Trucks with a load capacity of more than 25,000 catties move back and forth day and night. The construction of this bridge began after a makeshift straw bridge was erected. The morale of the bridge workers was exceptionally high. A bridge-building team from a vegetable garden in Zhangqingkou, Xiong County, having just arrived from a journey of more than 100 li, immediately began tying, erecting, and hammering, throwing themselves into their work. Wang Shuncai, the foreman from Zhangqingkou, never left the bridge workers for a moment, walking back and forth along the scaffolding, constantly encouraging and urging everyone. The cook delivered meals to the riverbank for the bridge workers every day, and everyone immediately went back to work after eating, and consciously formed a competition in their work. Blacksmiths and carpenters, in order not to delay work, always prepared nails and pile materials early. In this way, working hard day and night, the bridge was finally built. The next day, a motorcade of trucks carrying more than 25,000 catties crossed the bridge, spanning the Yongding River, transporting large quantities of military supplies to the front line.

[Hebei Central, 11th Dispatch] The sound of the Northeast Liberation Army attacking the outskirts of Tianjin inspired the people in the suburbs of Tianjin. The masses in Niezi Village, about 30 li from Tianjin, were all excited. They said, "The Liberation Army is helping us fight Tianjin, but we still have something to do: there is no bridge over the big river next to the village, how will the Liberation Army cross it?" A poor peasant, Zhang Xingheng, chimed in, "Right! We should build a bridge quickly." This sentence was like an order, spreading from one person to two, from two people to four, throughout the whole village. People were so excited that they seemed to have forgotten the cold and the falling snow. Braving the biting cold, they carried sorghum stalks, shovels, and earth baskets, shouting in unison to participate in bridge building. Those who went into the water, drove piles, built wooden structures, and carried earth, were all busy. As they worked, they laughed and said, "We should see the light of day now, Chiang Kai-shek is at the end of his rope." The more they worked, the more energetic they became, and they worked all night, and a strong bridge was built. The people of Niezi Village stood on this newly built bridge, looking forward to the arrival of the Liberation Army liberating Tianjin.

　　固安等县群众热烈参战
  　星夜架起永定河桥
  　大批军需物资运赴平津前线
    【冀中平津前线电】固安等县群众，以极高度的支前热情，在五天一夜的艰苦工作下，架起了历来就不容易架设的永定河某地大桥。现经平大公路直奔前线，畅通无阻。载重二万五千余的汽车，日以继夜的来回开动着。架这座大桥，是在先架起草桥之后开始的，桥工们的情绪都异常高涨，雄县张清口某菜园的打桥班，刚从百余里的长途赶来，就绑架、砸桥，工作起来，张清口的工头王顺才，一会也不离开桥工们，沿着架子走来走去，嘴里不断在鼓励和督促着大家，桥工每天吃饭由伙夫送到河堤上，大家吃完了马上就工作，并自觉的在工作中形成了竞赛。铁匠、木匠等为了不误工，他们老是早早的就把钉子桩料做好。就这样黑夜白天的紧张工作，把桥终于架起来了。第二天载重二万五千余斤的汽车大队，通过大桥，横跨永定河，将大批军需物资，源源运赴前线。
    【冀中十一日电】东北解放大军攻打天津外围的炮声传到后，鼓舞了津郊一带的人民。距天津三十来里的啮嘴村的群众都激动起来。他们说：“解放军帮助咱们打天津，可是咱们还有点事没作：村边上那条大河没有桥，解放军来到怎么过呢？”一个贫苦的农民张兴恒接过来说：“对！咱们不如赶紧架上一座桥。”这句话好象一道命令，一个传两个、两个传四个全村传遍了，人们兴奋的象忘了冷忘了天正下雪。他们冒着刺骨的寒天，扛着秫秸，拿着铁锨，挑着土篮子，齐声呐喊着都来参加修桥。下水的，打桩的，搭木的，挑土的，个个不闲。他们一面做着，一面欢笑的说：“咱们这就该见见天日啦，蒋介石可到末日了。”越干越上劲，一直干了一宿，坚固的桥架起来了，啮嘴村的人们，站在这刚架起的桥头上，了望着解放天津的解放军的到来。
