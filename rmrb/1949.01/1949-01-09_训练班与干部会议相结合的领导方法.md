Leadership Method Combining Training Class and Cadre Meeting
    Bei Yue Yi Di Wei (北岳一地委)
    The November summary report of the Bei Yue First Prefectural Committee (北岳一地委) on the rotational training of party member village cadres in various counties provided an important experience: Due to the new changes in objective tasks and subjective leadership conditions, such as the arduousness of tasks, the elevation of ideological leadership to a more important position, and the relative increase in cadre mobility, the method of combining training classes and cadre meetings is one of the best ways to lead rural branches under the current new situation. The following is a brief introduction to its experience for research and reference in various regions.

    Based on the current actual tasks and the investigation and understanding of the general situation of the current branches and their existing main problems, the county leadership systematically and with emphasis, with the village as a unit, relatively concentratedly provides rotational training for more effective and influential party member village cadres, party men and women activists, and better elements. It is best to have one village per residential quarter for each period, and to mobilize eight or nine party member cadres from each village for training, paying attention to the fact that new and old cadres must account for a certain proportion, in order to solve the currently most difficult problem of disunity among new and old cadres in branch work, and to avoid one-sidedness when solving problems, which can lead to being biased. As many non-Party cadres as possible, especially the main cadres in people's congresses or peasant representative conferences, non-Party activists, and better elements, should be absorbed to participate, so that they can understand the opinions of the masses on the branch party members, and correctly organize the supervision of the masses through them (there should be this kind of supervision in the training class, and the supervision of the masses can also be correctly organized through them after returning to the village), focusing on solving the problem of the relationship between the Party and the masses, and appropriately developing the Party or preparing development targets and conditions. Good villages and backward villages should also account for a certain proportion, so as to influence the backward through demonstrations and appropriately organize mutual competition and supervision between villages. District-level cadres and residential quarter cadres must also participate, on the one hand, to participate in learning in order to improve their own professional knowledge and work ability; on the other hand, to participate in leadership, to avoid the situation where district-level leadership cannot keep up after training, or the spirit of solving problems is inconsistent with the leadership of the training class.

    The general procedure should be based on the actual situation and actual tasks, and also based on the principle of long-term ideological construction. The leadership should check and self-examine general problems, especially policy problems and work problems, to inspire everyone to put forward opinions, organize typical reports on the main problems among them to further inspire democratic discussion, so that correct and incorrect opinions are fully exposed to stir up debate. After that, the leadership must grasp the key to several major issues, seek appropriate timing, and explain the Party's major viewpoints. For example, on the issue of production prospects and revolutionary prospects, the issue of the standards of party members, the issue of democracy and discipline, and the relationship between the interests of the Party and personal interests, conduct basic communist knowledge education of the Party through these issues, and combine them with practical problems to raise them to a certain principled level for criticism. On the basis of this education, inspire everyone to carry out criticism and self-criticism, clarify the right and wrong of the issues, and draw ideological boundaries. At this time, the leadership should shift its focus to cultivating and using cadres with correct understanding, and implement breakthroughs in key villages and key issues. For example, the Wa Cun Qiu training class once grasped Long Ling's sectarianism problem and Qiaomai Chuan's problem of impurity within the party and made breakthroughs, which had great educational significance. This is mainly to draw a line ideologically, and at the same time, try to solve the actual problems as much as possible.

    In the process of solving the above problems or on the basis of solving the problems, further carry out the education of the Party's basic viewpoints, such as the labor viewpoint, the mass viewpoint, the class viewpoint, and the organizational viewpoint, so that everyone can turn their attention to the actual tasks and think of ways to do a good job in the village. The leadership should then put forward tasks in a timely manner, discuss and formulate work plans with the village as a unit, including the Party's organizational life, systems, etc. After everyone's discussion, correction, and supplementation, organize competition and supervision between villages and residential quarters, and establish a mutual inspection system to eliminate the separation between villages and certain village-based phenomena—in the future, in the new democratic economic construction in rural areas, attention must be paid to eliminating this phenomenon.

    This leadership method combining training classes and cadre meetings has the following advantages: (1) It is a cadre meeting, focusing on ideological guidance, ideological transformation and construction. This kind of unified and in-depth ideological education is difficult for the current district-level leading organs to achieve, but if this is not achieved, all work will lack a foundation. (2) It is a training class, but it is different from ordinary training classes that are only for promoting cadres or scattered training of village work backbones. It is necessary to solve practical problems and deploy work tasks, and the current policies are implemented from the county to the village through the joint leadership of the district, avoiding simplification and inconsistency in conveying the spirit. The work plan it formulates can also serve as the basis for the county's work plan. Although it is not specifically for promoting cadres and training backbones, it can actually better complete these two tasks. Experience has proved that wherever the rural branch is not rectified, the work of promoting cadres becomes more and more difficult. (3) It will learn a leadership method that is separate from handicraft-style leadership, and learn a more concentrated and focused leadership method, and this leadership method is suitable for the current needs and cadre conditions. After county and district cadres, especially district and residential quarter cadres, receive this training themselves and learn this leadership method, they will greatly strengthen the leadership of the Party's primary organizations, and ensure the consistency of the spirit of the leadership from top to bottom, and ensure the connection of district and village leadership after training. This method can also be applied to districts or residential quarters when it is promoted. The implementation of party rectification in some places with the residential quarter as a unit under the leadership of a relatively strong work team is one example. It should be noted that the promotion of this method must be closely combined with the top-down inspection system and the system of mutual inspection and supervision between villages. Without the latter as a supplement, its actual effectiveness will be unreliable.

　　训练班与干部会议相结合的领导方法
    北岳一地委
    北岳一地委十一月份关于各县轮训党员村干的总结报告，其中提供了如下一个重要的经验，即：由于客观任务与主观领导条件都发生了新变化，如任务繁重，思想领导被提到更重要的地位，干部流动性相对增大等，训练班与干部会议相结合的方法，是目前新形势下领导农村支部的最好方式之一。兹特扼要介绍其经验，供各地研究参考。
    由当前实际任务出发，根据目前支部一般情况及其现存主要问题的调查了解，县领导上有步骤，有重点地以村为单位，较集中地轮训较有作用有影响的党员村干，党的男女积极分子与较好分子。最好每期每小区有一个村，每村调训八九个党员干部并注意新老干部必须占一定比例，以便于解决目前支部工作中最感棘手的新老干部不团结问题，及避免解决问题时偏听一面之词，流于片面。非党干部，特别是人民代表会或农民代表会中的主要干部，非党积极分子与较好分子，要尽可能多吸收参加，以便于经过他们了解群众对支部党员的意见，并经过他们正确组织群众的监督（训练班中要有这种监督，回村后亦可通过他们正确组织群众监督），有重点地解决党与群众的关系问题，并适当地发展党或准备发展对象与条件。好村与落后村也要占一定比例，以便于通过示范影响落后，并适当组织村与村间的互相竞赛与监督。区级干部与小区干部亦必须参加，一方面参加学习，借以提高其本身的业务知识与工作能力；一方面参加领导，避免训练后区级领导赶不上去，或解决问题的精神与训练班领导不一致。
    进行的一般程序，应根据现实情况、现实任务出发，而又从长期的思想建设着眼的原则，由领导上对一般问题特别是政策问题与工作问题的检查及自我检讨，启发大家提出意见，对其中主要问题组织典型报告，以进一步启发民主讨论，使正确与不正确的意见全部暴露，以掀起争论。之后，领导上必须抓紧若干主要问题的关键，寻求适当时机，将党的若干主要观点加以讲解。例如关于生产前途与革命前途问题，党员的标准问题，民主与纪律问题，党的利益与个人利益的关系问题，通过这些问题进行党的共产主义的基本知识教育，并结合现实问题提到一定的原则水平上加以批判。在这个教育基础上，启发大家开展批评与自我批评，弄清问题的是非黑白，划清思想界限。这时领导上要转而着重于培养与使用认识正确的骨干分子，实行重点村与重点问题的突破，例如洼村邱训练班曾抓住龙灵的宗派问题与荞麦川的党内不纯问题并突破之，教育意义甚大。这主要是从思想上划清界线，同时要尽可能地求得实际解决问题。
    在上述解决问题的过程中或解决问题的基础上，更深入一步进行党的基本观点的教育，如劳动观点，群众观点、阶级观点，组织观点等，便能够使大家把眼光转到现实任务上来，都想办法如何把村子工作做好。领导上即适时提出任务，以村为单位讨论订出工作计划，包括党的组织生活、制度等，经过大家讨论、纠正、补充后，组织村与村、区与区之间的竞赛与监督，建立相互检查制度，以破除村与村隔阂及某些村本位现象—今后农村党在新民主主义经济建设中，一定要注意消除这种现象。
    这种训练班与干部会议相结合的领导方法，有以下几种好处：（一）它是干部会议，着重思想指导、着重思想改造与建设。这种统一的深入的思想教育，是目前区级领导机关所难做到的，但如果不做到这一点，一切工作均将缺乏基础。（二）它是训练班，但不同于一般只为了提拔干部或零散地培养村工作骨干的训练班，它要解决实际问题与布置工作任务，将当前政策经过区的共同领导由县一直贯彻到村，避免简单化与传达精神之不一致。其订出的工作计划且可作为县的工作计划的基础。它虽然并非专门为提拔干部和培养骨干，实际上能更好的完成这两个任务。经验证明：哪里农村支部未整顿好，哪里的提拔干部工作便越来越难做好。（三）它将由此学会一种脱离手工业式的领导方法，学会较集中的有重点的领导方法，而这种领导方法是适合于目前的需要和干部条件的。县区干部特别是区与小区干部，在自身受到这种训练而又学会此种领导方法以后，将会大大地加强党的基层组织的领导，而且保证上下领导精神之一致，保证训练后区村领导之衔接。这种办法推广开去，同样能施行于区或小区。某些地方在较强的工作组领导下实行以小区为单位整党，即其一例。推行此种方法应注意之点，必须与自上而下的检查制度和村与村间彼此相互检查监督的制度相紧密结合，没有后者为其补充，其实际成效便将是不可靠的。
