Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: TASS, Moscow: Yuri Bruskin, a member of the Soviet youth delegation that recently visited North Korea, stated: The Korean government led by Kim Il-sung, which is supported by the entire people, has implemented extensive democratic reforms, guaranteeing the rapid development of the national economy and culture. As a result of the land reform, 788,249 peasant households have received land. The land reform has led to a surge in agriculture and improved the material welfare of the peasants. Under the Japanese regime, peasants were forced to pay 70 to 90 percent of their harvest to landlords as rent. The achievements in the cultural field are particularly noteworthy. In less than three years, North Korea has opened approximately 3,000 primary schools, over 900 secondary schools, 68 technical colleges, 10 research institutes, and one university. The majority of the schools were established with funds raised by the people themselves. The Korean people are particularly proud of the university named after Kim Il-sung. This university was established with funds raised by the peasants, and 2,500 Korean students are studying there. In the past, Korea only had one university located in Seoul, and most of the students were Japanese. The Democratic Youth League plays a significant role in the economic and cultural development of North Korea. The League has 1.3 million members, accounting for 80.9 percent of North Korean youth. In industry, transportation, and agriculture, League members have set an example of good work, launching competitions to achieve production targets. Between 1947 and 1948, the young men and women of North Korea contributed one million work hours to restore and build factories, mines, and mining areas.

　　北朝鲜实行土改后经济文化迅速发展
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近访问过北朝鲜的苏联青年代表团团员尤里·勃鲁斯基契金谈称：金日成所领导的为全民所拥护的朝鲜政府，已实施了广泛的民主改革，保证了国民经济与文化的迅速发展。由于实行了土地改革，有七十八万八千二百四十九家农户得到了土地。土地改革带来了农业的高涨和农民物质福利的改善。而在日本政权下，农民曾被迫向地主交纳百分之七十到九十的收获，作为地租。特别引人注目的是文化领域内的成就。在不足三年内，北朝鲜即开办了约三千所小学、九百余所中学、六十八所技术专科学校、十所研究所和一所大学。大多数学校都是由人民自己筹集资金建立起来的。朝鲜人民对于命名为金日成的大学特别引以为荣。该大学是由农民筹集资金建立起来的，两千五百名朝鲜学生在该大学读书。在过去，朝鲜只有一所设在汉城的大学，而大多数学生都是日本人。民主青年同盟在北朝鲜的经济与文化发展中起了重大作用。该盟拥有会员一百三十万人，占北朝鲜青年的百分之八十点九。在工业、运输业及农业中，盟员树立了良好工作的模范，发动竞赛，达到生产目标。在一九四七年至一九四八年间，北朝鲜的青年男女们献工一百万小时，用以恢复和修建工厂、矿场和矿山。
