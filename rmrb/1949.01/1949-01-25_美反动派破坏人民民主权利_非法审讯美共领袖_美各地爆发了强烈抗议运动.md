Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 22nd: Reports from various sources: The U.S. Federal Court's illegal "trial" of twelve leaders of the American Communist Party began on January 17th in the New York Federal Court. After being indicted by a federal grand jury on July 20th of last year on charges of "propaganda advocating the overthrow of the government" and arrested, the twelve leaders of the American Communist Party were subsequently released on bail due to the angry protests of people around the world, and the "trial" was postponed several times as a result. At the opening of the court on the 17th, all eleven American Communist leaders except the seriously ill American Communist Party Chairman Foster appeared in court. In order to create an atmosphere of terror during the trial and prevent people's demonstrations, the New York City authorities dispatched the largest number of police officers in the history of New York's judiciary, a total of 402, to be stationed at the Federal Building where the court was located. At the same time, more police officers and countless FBI agents and plainclothes officers patrolled the surrounding area, while only 70 spectators and 70 reporters were allowed to attend the court. After the opening of the court, the chief defense lawyer for the defendants, Mr. Sacher, immediately demanded that the presiding judge Medina remove the police from the courtroom and its surroundings. Sacher solemnly pointed out: "Sending police around the court is to create Hitler-style lies. The constitution guarantees a public trial, not a police trial." However, this request was unreasonably rejected by Medina.

TASS pointed out: This trial is not only a matter of the fate of the twelve American Communist leaders, but also a matter of the legal existence of the American Communist Party and the democratic rights of the American people. Therefore, this ugly "trial" has aroused strong protest movements among the American people. While the "trial" was underway, progressive groups in New York formed picket lines around the court to confront the police. Thousands of people in Washington also held a "Great March for Freedom" to oppose this violation of the people's democratic rights. The American League for Human Rights has begun to organize a series of mass protest rallies across the country, and progressive people in various places have issued declarations or sent letters and telegrams to Congress and the government, expressing serious protests. The American Communist Party and the broad masses of American democratic people are determined to shatter this despicable conspiracy inside and outside the court and expose the reactionary essence of American imperialist policy. The New York Daily Worker pointed out to the American people in an editorial on the 17th: As long as the people rise up to fight for this, this conspiracy against democracy and freedom can be defeated.

### 美反动派破坏人民民主权利　非法审讯美共领袖  美各地爆发了强烈抗议运动

　　美反动派破坏人民民主权利
  　非法审讯美共领袖
    美各地爆发了强烈抗议运动
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方报导：美国联邦法院对美共十二位领袖的非法“审讯”，已于一月十七日在纽约联邦法院开始。美共十二位领袖自去年七月廿日被联邦大陪审团以“鼓吹推翻政府的宣传”之罪名起诉并被逮捕以后，随即因世界人民的愤怒抗议而被保释，“审讯”亦曾因此数度延期。十七日开庭时，除身患重病的美共主席福斯特外，但尼斯等十一位美共领袖全部出庭。为了在审讯中造成恐怖气氛，阻止人民的示威，纽约市当局在开庭时出动了纽约司法史上最大的一批警察，计四百零二名，赴法庭所在地的联邦大厦驻守。同时，还有更多的警察与无数的联邦调查局的特务、便衣们在周围巡逻，而法庭以内，却只容许七十名旁听者与七十名记者列席。开庭以后，被告的首席辩护人沙彻尔律师首即要求主审官麦迪纳撤除法庭上及其周围的警察。沙彻尔严正指出：“把警察派至法庭四周，是要制造希特勒式的谎言。宪法所保障的是公开审讯而不是警察审讯。”但这一要求竟为迪麦纳无理拒绝。
    塔斯社指出：这次审讯将不仅是一个关系美共十二位领袖命运的问题，而且也是一个关系美共合法存在与美国人民民主权利的问题。因此，这一丑恶的“审讯”，激起了美国人民强烈的抗议运动。就在“审讯”进行时，纽约进步团体在法庭周围组成了纠察线以与警察对抗。华盛顿亦有数千人举行了“自由大进军”反对这种对人民民主权利的残害。美国人权保障大会已着手在全国各地组织一连串的群众抗议大会，各地进步人民则纷纷发表宣言，或致书致电国会与政府，表示严重抗议。美国共产党与广大美国民主人民，决心在法庭内外粉碎这一卑劣阴谋，揭露美国帝国主义政策的反动本质。纽约工人日报在十七日社论中向美国人民指出：只要人民起来为此而斗争，这种反对民主自由的阴谋诡计是能够击破的。
