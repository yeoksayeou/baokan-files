To the Editorial Board:

　　I have a suggestion; could you please forward it to the government? Currently, the workers in our Shijiazhuang City are highly enthusiastic about production, and the number of workers in the city is very large, but there isn’t even a place for employees to rest and entertain themselves. Although each factory (state-owned enterprise) has a club affiliated with the trade union, they are not successful. There was a workers' drama club, but because they didn't care about the entertainment of the workers, everyone was disappointed in them. When the labor representatives returned from the conference, I asked them how the workers in the Northeast were doing. They told me they were very energetic because they had good places to relax and entertain themselves after work. My opinion is: In order to continuously improve the enthusiasm and thinking of employees in production, it is very necessary to establish a good place for employees to rest and entertain themselves.

　　石市电灯公司工人要求建立工人公共娱乐场所编辑同志：
    我有一个建议，请转给政府，是否可以？现在我们石家庄市的工人，在生产情绪上非常高，全市的工人数目又是很多，可是连一个职工休息娱乐的地方都没有。虽然各厂（公营企业）有职工会的俱乐部，但都搞不起来。有一个工人剧社，也是因为他们不关心工人的娱乐，使大家对他们失望。这次劳大代表回来，我问他们东北职工弟兄工作怎样？他们告诉我非常起劲，就是因为在工作完了之后，有很好的娱乐休息的地方。我的意见是：为了要使职工在生产情绪上、在思想上继续提高，是很需要建立一个很好的职工娱乐休息场所。（石家庄电灯公司工人）
