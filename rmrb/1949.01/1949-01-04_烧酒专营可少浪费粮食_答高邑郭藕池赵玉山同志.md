　　Liquor is originally a luxury, but it is also a common indulgence that cannot be prohibited. Therefore, we have adopted the method of "implicit prohibition through taxation." People often use good grain to make liquor, thus wasting good grain; while the government has some spoiled grain that would be wasted if not made into liquor. However, using it for liquor production utilizes this spoiled grain, meets the people's need for alcohol, and can also be used in medical and chemical factories to produce alcohol for medical purposes. However, there is not much spoiled grain. To meet the practical needs, a portion of good grain is also used for liquor production, but it is exclusively controlled by the government. "Implicit prohibition through taxation" can reduce the amount of liquor produced, and raising the price will make people feel that liquor is expensive, reducing the number of drinkers, which in turn reduces the amount of grain used for liquor production.

### 烧酒专营可少浪费粮食　答高邑郭藕池赵玉山同志

　　烧酒专营可少浪费粮食
  　答高邑郭藕池赵玉山同志
    酒本来是一种嗜好品，但它又带有普遍性，不能禁绝，所以采取了“寓禁于征”的办法。老百姓烧酒常常用好粮食，因此把好粮食浪费了；而公家却有一部分烂粮，不制成酒，也会白白浪费掉，但用在烧酒方面，既利用了这一部分烂粮，又适应了群众喝酒的需要，另外还可以在医药化学厂制造酒精用以治病。不过烂粮　没有多少，为适应现实需要，因此也用一部分好粮食烧酒，但也是由公家专门掌握，“寓禁于征”可以少烧一些，而价格提高一点，老百姓感到酒贵，就减少喝酒的人，这也就是减少了用粮食烧酒。
