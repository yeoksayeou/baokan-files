[Hebei Central Radio] Liu Chonghua Tuan Village in Anping County is located near the Hutuo River and suffered severe flooding last year, with most households barely managing to secure enough food for the winter. The village has a foundation for weaving horsehair luo silk. Out of the 94 households in the village, 54 households have women who can weave luo silk, with a total of 80 looms. However, due to a shortage of horsehair, only 12 households are currently weaving. When the County Production Promotion Cooperative came to the village to organize production, it was decided to first support the village's luo silk weaving industry. Many households wanted to weave luo silk but lacked horsehair. It was then decided to have 17 households without horsehair weave by hand, with a wage of 2,200 yuan per luo silk. It was also agreed that the Promotion Cooperative would come to the village to collect the silk once every market day. As a result, 29 households in the village are now weaving luo silk, operating 35 looms. The weaving households are highly motivated. The Promotion Cooperative is working on providing loans of horsehair to the remaining 20-plus weaving households who are not active, to organize them to weave luo silk.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Editor's Note: The Anping County Production Promotion Cooperative's support for the Liu Chonghua Tuan Village's luo silk weaving households is excellent. A luo silk weaving supply and marketing cooperative should also be organized, which would further benefit the masses' luo silk weaving production. At the same time, the County Production Promotion Cooperative can concentrate its efforts to strengthen its leadership over the county's production.

　　安平县
  　推进社贷马尾组织群众织罗
    【冀中电】安平县刘重华疃村，靠近滹沱河，去年因水淹的很厉害，大部分的户也不过闹个冬饱。这村有织马尾罗的基础，全村九十四户，就有五十四户的妇女会织罗，一共有八十张机子。可是因为缺少马尾，现在只有十二户织罗。县生产推进社到村组织生产时，决定先把这村的织罗业扶植起来。有好多户想织罗没有马尾。当时就决定让十七户没马尾的户给织手工，一个罗二千二百元的手工。还商量好推进社一集上这村来收一次。这样全村就有廿九户织罗的了，活动着三十五张机子。织罗户情绪很高。没有活动的那二十多织罗户，推进社正在设法贷给他们马尾，组织他们织罗。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者意见：安平县生产推进社，扶植刘重华疃村织罗户织罗，这是很好的。还应该把织罗的供销合作社组织起来，这样对群众织罗生产增加更多好处。同时县生产推进社也可以集中力量，加强对全县生产的领导。
