　　Enthusiastically Responding to the Call for Supporting the Troops
  　North China Bureau and Government Units Launch a Wave of Support
    First Group of North China慰问团 Personnel Depart for the Front Lines
    [This Newspaper] Following the North China Government's call for supporting the troops in the New Year, comrades of the North China Bureau, Military Region, and directly subordinate organs and departments of the North China Government have enthusiastically launched a wave of support for the troops. The movement is now unfolding vigorously, and慰劳committees in various localities have received large quantities of慰劳items. The North China慰劳Committee, jointly formed by the North China Bureau, the North China People's Government, and the Military Region Headquarters, has formed a慰问团. The first group of慰问personnel, led by Vice Chairman of the Government Lan Gongwu and Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Bureau Zhou Rongxin, has departed for the front lines to offer慰劳.
    [This Newspaper] Various organs of the North China Bureau have launched a热潮of support for the troops, rushing to markets to buy慰劳items, sewing慰问bags, writing慰问letters... As of now, the Secretariat and the Propaganda Department alone have made over fifty慰问bags. Cigarettes, towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, tooth powder, popular reading materials, socks, soap, peanuts, dates... All kinds of supplies and food fill each慰问bag.
    When the various branches called for support for the troops, the masses were inspired. From cadres to support staff, everyone scrambled to participate, staying up late into the night. Comrade Wei @ of the Propaganda Department finished her慰问bag and wrote a慰劳poem as a gift to the warriors who liberated Tianjin and Beijing. Comrade Zhai Duyin of the Administrative Section also wrote a poem and carefully decorated his慰问bag. Many comrades donated items they had saved and were reluctant to use to the heroic commanders and fighters who were bravely fighting the enemy in the freezing weather to liberate Tianjin and Beijing. Many comrades who didn't have money borrowed their January subsidies to buy things. They said, "We can smoke a little less so that the comrades fighting bravely against the enemy in the icy and snowy front lines don't lack cigarettes." Comrade Wang Guozhi had just returned from a work trip and was leaving again tomorrow. Upon hearing about the support for the troops, he immediately bought cigarettes and rushed to make a慰问bag.
    The cooks are busy during the day, so they rushed to make them at night. Little Zhang, who had just arrived, took out all the money he had saved for a long time to support the troops. He said, "Our comrades on the front lines are fighting in such cold weather, they should be well慰劳ed." The comrades of the livestock team found out later and, seeing others handing in慰问bags, ten or so people rushed to make five.
    Other departments of the North China Bureau are also collecting慰劳items to send to the front lines.
    [This Newspaper] After the government-駐村Organ Club accepted the administrative commission to take on the task of supporting the troops, it immediately convened a joint meeting of the club committee, the head of the life committee, and the heads of the life groups to discuss, arrange, and plan some of the technical issues of sewing慰劳bags. Leading comrades responsible for the organ also took time out of their busy schedules to come to guide and speak, explaining the great significance of supporting the troops. Everyone's enthusiasm was high. After the meeting, a热潮of support for the troops immediately swept through the organ. Some units spontaneously held meetings overnight to discuss plans. All comrades in the General Affairs Section and the Administrative Office immediately voluntarily responded to the call, preparing to sew慰劳bags and automatically donating soap, towels, toothbrushes, diaries, pencils, etc.
    In this热烈的movement to support the troops, slogans such as "One Bag Per Person," "慰劳Bags Should Be Exquisitely Made, Beautiful, and Durable," "The Gifts Inside the Bag Should All Be Useful Items for Soldiers," and "Each Bag Should Contain More Than Five Different Gifts" were put forward. Comrade Li Mingshu of the 文印Section took out all the millet he had saved and made seven慰劳bags. The gifts inside the bags were rich and exquisite. Comrade Liu Su even contributed things that she usually couldn't bear to use. Many comrades sent more than ten gifts in the慰劳bags. The female comrades, in order to help the male comrades overcome the difficulties of sewing, volunteered to serve as technical guides or personally sewed, embroidered, and painted for the male comrades until late at night. The guards and cooks also joined the movement. Some who couldn't write asked others to dictate while they took notes, writing慰问letters for them. The club cooperated with the movement by adding a special edition of the wall newspaper every day to report news, commend models, and exchange experiences. The General Affairs Section also bought some fabrics and慰劳gifts from the market and resold them at cost, making it convenient for some comrades to purchase gifts. In this way, all the organ's working comrades poured into the热潮of supporting the troops. In order to avoid confusion and loss, the club established a good set of registration, labeling, packaging, and management procedures, with centralized leadership, division of labor, and mutual supervision and joint management. It is now actively preparing to hold an exhibition of慰劳bags and commend the models who have enthusiastically contributed. (Secretariat of the North China People's Government)
    [This Newspaper] In Shijiazhuang, workers enthusiastically donated money and labor. The skilled iron workers of the three districts of Shijiazhuang City proposed: If we draw a small portion from the wages of the more than 10,000 道钉we recently contracted, we can make 200慰问bags. Teachers and students of North China University and various middle and primary schools enthusiastically responded to the call for supporting the troops. The faculty and staff of Shijiazhuang No. 2 Middle School also saved expenses and made every effort to donate, wanting to express their feelings to the soldiers on the front lines. All the old artists in Shijiazhuang City also actively responded, writing慰问letters and making a慰问bag each.

    【本报讯】华北局各机关展开了劳军热潮，赶集买慰劳品，缝慰问袋，写慰问信……截至目前为止，单只秘书处、宣传部两个单位就做了五十几个慰问袋。纸烟、毛巾、牙刷、牙膏、牙粉、通俗读物、袜子，肥皂、花生、枣……各色各样的用品、食品塞满了每个慰问袋。
    当各支部号召劳军时，群情振奋，从干部到勤杂人员都争先恐后，深夜不眠，宣传部韦＠同志做好她的慰问袋，并写慰劳诗一首赠给解放平津的勇士们。行政科翟都印同志，也写诗一首，精心装饰他的慰问袋，很多同志将自己存下舍不得用的东西都拿出来捐赠给英勇解放平津的指战员，不少同志没有钱，预借了一月份的津帖购买东西。他们说：“咱少抽一点烟也要叫前方冰天雪地英勇杀敌的同志们不缺烟吃。”王国志同志出发工作才回来，明天还要出发，听到劳军，马上买了纸烟赶做好了慰问袋。
    炊事班白天工作忙，夜里赶制。新来的小张，把积蓄很久舍不得花的钱全部拿出劳军，他说：“咱们前方同志在那样冷天打仗，可该好好慰劳慰劳。”饲养班的同志知道得较迟，看到别人交慰问袋，十来个人也赶做了五个。
    华北局其他部门也在汇集着慰劳品送往前线。
    【本报讯】政府驻村机关俱乐部在接受了行政的委托，担负起劳军任务以后，马上召开俱乐部委员、生活大队长与生活小组长联席会议，讨论、布置、计划缝制慰劳袋的一些技术问题，机关负责首长亦在百忙中抽暇亲临指导，讲话，阐释劳军之重大意义。大家情绪高涨。会后立即在机关里掀起劳军热潮。有的单位自动连夜开会讨论计划，庶务股和行政处全体同志们当即自愿的响应号召，各人分头准备缝制慰劳袋，并自动捐出肥皂、毛巾、牙刷、日记本、铅笔等等。
    在这一热烈的劳军运动中提出“一人一袋”，“慰劳袋要精制美观坚牢”，“袋内的礼物要件件都是战士有用的物品”，“每袋要求放入五件以上不同的礼物”等口号，文印科李明书同志将自己积蓄的一些小米全部拿出来做了七个慰劳袋，袋内礼物丰富精致，刘苏同志甚至连自己平日用都舍不得用的东西也贡献出来，不少同志在慰劳袋内送上十件以上的礼物，女同志们为着帮助男同志克服缝制的困难，都自动起来担任技术指导，或亲替男同志们缝制绣花绘画作到夜深也不歇手。警卫员、炊事员同志们也全体涌入这个运动，有些不会写字的则请别人一边念一边记，替他代笔写慰问信，俱乐部配合运动每天增出墙报专号，及时报导消息，表扬模范，交流经验。总务科又从市集上买回一些布料与慰劳礼品原价转售，使得一部分同志感到采购礼物的方便。就这样全体机关工作同志们涌入了劳军运动的热潮。俱乐部为了避免混乱遗失，建立了一套很好的登记、贴名字、包装、管理的手续，集中领导分工负责，互相督促，共同管理，现正积极着手筹备举行一次慰劳袋展览大会，并对踊跃输将的模范进行表扬。（华北人民政府秘书厅）
