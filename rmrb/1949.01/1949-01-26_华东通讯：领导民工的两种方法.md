Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th: In the Jinan Campaign, the Third Battalion of the Yishan Stretcher Brigade of Luzhongnan, which won the title of "Model Battalion," experienced severe desertion in the Huaihai Campaign due to bureaucratic leadership. Conversely, the Subei Lianshui Labor Support Detachment, due to sound leadership, overcame various difficulties and further consolidated its organization. This contrasting fact fully illustrates that the key to the success or failure of the labor work lies in the leadership.

The Third Battalion of the Yishan Stretcher Brigade, during the Jinan Campaign, the entire labor force disregarded all fatigue and danger, and heroically completed the glorious task of rescuing wounded commanders and fighters from the front lines and transporting ammunition and military supplies to the front lines. However, by the Huaihai Campaign, the same laborers were deserting in large numbers. Why did they desert? According to the investigation, the main reasons for the desertion of the battalion are as follows: (1) After winning the title of "Model Battalion" in the Jinan Campaign, the leading cadres of the battalion became complacent and relaxed their leadership. For example, after the end of the Jinan Campaign, some laborers requested demobilization. Later, before going south to support the Huaihai front, individual desertions began to occur, but the leading cadres did not pay attention. (2) Lack of political mobilization and ideological education for the laborers. At the beginning of the campaign, the laborers were not educated about the victorious development prospects of the war, but merely accommodated the idea among the laborers that they were "afraid of being too far away from home," mechanically proposing "not to leave Luzhongnan" and "not to leave the Longhai Line." When the war situation developed to the point where it was necessary to leave the Longhai Line, the laborers were not mobilized or explained, causing many laborers to complain that the cadres did not call them to demobilize because they did not understand the victorious situation and the importance of supporting the Huaihai Campaign, and the phenomenon of desertion increased sharply. (3) The work style of the cadres was not good, and they did not care about the lives of the laborers. The battalion commander and company commander had both beaten people, including laborers. The laborers did not have cotton clothes, shoes, and socks, and the cadres did not actively help them solve their difficulties, but instead asked the troops for military uniforms for themselves. This aroused the dissatisfaction of the laborers with the cadres, and the courageous and enthusiastic working spirit of the laborers in the Jinan Campaign was weakened. (4) The cadres lacked the spirit of self-criticism and shirked responsibility when encountering difficulties. When the phenomenon of labor desertion had already occurred, they did not carefully study the reasons for the desertion, nor did they listen to the opinions of the laborers. Instead, they blamed the superiors for not allowing demobilization when it was due, and blamed the masses for being "backward." The battalion commander blamed the scheduling cadres, saying that the laborers' desertion was "mainly due to the irresponsibility of the scheduling cadres," saying that "we alone cannot stop it," and saying that "we can't think of a good way to educate them now." (5) The organizational life was very unsound, and the bastion role of the Party branch was not brought into play. There was no branch meeting for more than a month, and no attention was paid to bringing into play the initiative and leading role of the Party members.

The situation of the Subei Lianshui Labor Support Detachment was the opposite of that of the Third Battalion of the Yishan Stretcher Brigade. Before the detachment set off, due to the temporary views of the county and district leaders, not enough attention was paid to the deployment of grassroots cadres in the labor team, not enough ideological mobilization was done for the laborers, and the laborers' clothes, shoes, and other supplies were not adequately prepared. Individual desertions occurred after the laborers set off. However, after discovering these situations, the leading cadres of the labor support detachment immediately seized the gaps in the march and carried out the following tasks to eliminate the phenomenon of desertion: (1) From within the Party to outside the Party, from the squad and company cadres to the laborers, they repeatedly conducted ideological education, and held group discussions on issues such as "Do we want to permanently protect the interests of those who have turned over (the team was composed of peasants who had turned over)? How can we protect the interests of those who have turned over?" and other issues to enlighten the class consciousness of the laborers. (2) Commended several good laborers, democratically dealt with the runaway laborers, and called on everyone to learn from the good labor teams. (3) Educated the laborers with the examples of the Jiaodong labor teams trekking long distances to support the front lines, breaking the laborers' ideological concerns about being afraid of crossing the railway. (4) Called on cadres to share hardships with the laborers. More than 20 cadres and Party members in Tongxing District of the county helped the laborers carry stretchers, grind flour, carry seriously ill patients, and serve mildly ill patients. Cadres from Yan, Qianji, and Wangji Districts took out their lined clothes, felt, and quilts to help the laborers solve their difficulties. (5) Organized the laborers to weave straw sandals in their spare time. Cadres from Yanxi, Kuahe, and other districts organized more than 1,000 laborers to save food rations and exchange them for ramie and reed catkins to make woolen nests and ramie shoes, which solved the difficulties of many people who did not have shoes. In addition, special attention was paid to taking care of the seriously ill laborers. Every day before the march, people were sent to find good houses for the駐地 so that the laborers could rest as soon as they arrived, reducing the laborers' fatigue.

　　华东通讯：领导民工的两种方法
    【新华社华东十八日电】在济南战役中荣获“模范营”的鲁中南沂山担架团第三营，在淮海战役中由于领导上官僚主义，发生严重的逃亡现象；反之，苏北涟水民工支队由于领导的健全，克服了种种困难而使组织更形巩固。这一事实的对照，充分说明了民工工作的好坏，关键在于领导。
    沂山担架团第三营，在济南战役时，全体民工曾不顾一切疲劳与危险，英勇完成了从火线抢救负伤指战员及向火线输送弹药军需的光荣任务。但是到淮海战役，同是这些民工，却纷纷逃亡。为什么逃亡？据检查，该营产生逃亡的原因，主要有下列几点：（一）济南战役中荣获“模范营”称号后，该营领导干部自满自足，放松领导。如济南战役结束后，曾有个别民工要求复员，以后南下支援淮海前线，开始发生个别逃亡，领导干部未引起注意。（二）对民工缺乏政治动员和思想教育。战役之初，未对民工进行战争胜利发展前途的教育，而仅仅迁就民工中“怕离家太远”的思想，机械地提出“不出鲁中南”、“不出陇海线”。当战争形势发展到需要出陇海线时，又未对民工进行动员解释，致很多民工因不了解胜利形势和支援淮海战役的重要性而埋怨干部不叫他们复员，逃亡现象骤增。（三）干部作风不好，不关心民工们的生活。该营营长连长都打过人，打过民工。民工没有棉衣、鞋袜，干部不积极帮助其解决困难，自己却向部队要了军装。这样就引起了民工对干部不满，使民工在济南战役中那种勇敢、热情的工作精神为之消淡。（四）干部没有自我批评的精神，遇到困难时推委责任。当民工逃亡现象既经发生，不仔细研究发生逃亡的原因，也不倾听民工的意见，反而一面怪上级到期不让复员，一面怪群众“落后”。营长怪排班干部，说民工逃亡“主要是排班级干部不负责任”，说“光我们是无法制止的”，说“现在也想不出好办法来教育”。（五）组织生活很不健全，没有发挥党的支部的堡垒作用，有一个多月不开支部会，没有注意发挥党员的积极性和带头作用。
    与沂山担架团第三营情况相反的就是苏北涟水民工支队，该支队在出发之前，由于县区领导上存在临时观点，对民工队基层干部配备不够重视，对民工的思想动员作得不够，民工的衣服、鞋子等亦准备不足，民工出发后曾发生个别逃亡。但是，该民工支队领导干部于发现这些情形后，马上抓紧行军空隙，进行下列各项工作，使逃亡现象趋于消灭：（一）由党内到党外，由分队中队干部到民工，反复进行思想教育，分组讨论了“要不要永远保住翻身利益（该队由翻身农民组成）？怎样才能保住翻身利益？”等问题以启发民工的阶级觉悟。（二）表扬几个好的民工，民主处理了逃跑民工，号召大家向好的民工队学习。（三）以胶东民工队跋涉长途支援前线的事例教育民工，打破了民工怕过铁路的思想顾虑。（四）号召干部与民工共艰苦。该县同兴区有二十余干部党员帮助民工抬担架，磨面、抬重病号，服侍轻病号。其盐、浅集、王集区干部拿出夹衣、毡子、被子帮助民工解决困难。（五）组织民工抽空打草鞋。盐西、跨河等区干部组织了一千余民工节省口粮，换成苘麻、芦花，打毛窝、苘麻鞋，这样解决了很多人没有鞋子的困难。此外特别注意照顾民工中的重病号，每天行军先派人看好驻地房子，使民工一到就能休息，减轻民工的疲劳。
