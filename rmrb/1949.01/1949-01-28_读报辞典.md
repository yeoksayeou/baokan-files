    Saragat Group – Saragat was originally a right-wing element of the Italian Socialist Party and served as the "Speaker" of the Italian "Constituent Assembly." Because he colluded with the reactionary British Labour Party Executive Committee, engaged in splitting activities within the labor movement, and opposed cooperation between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, he was spurned by progressive Italian workers. In January 1947, at the 25th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, a resolution was passed to expel Saragat from the party. The Saragat Group refers to this right-leaning, reactionary group headed by Saragat.
