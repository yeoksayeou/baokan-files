　　Working in Newly Recovered Cities
  　Should Strictly Observe City Discipline
    Editor:
    We have an unresolved issue in our thinking. Around November 22nd, at a small stall set up by the elderly Mrs. Wen, mother of Li Qitai, at No. 3 Beisi Street, West Guan Street, Jiexiu City, and Deng Qingkui, there were two glass tubes taken when Japan surrendered (one about one and a half to one and two-thirds feet long, and the other about seven to eight inches long). Eight or nine members of the Jiexiu Road Guard Detachment of the Tongpu Railway, led by Detachment Leader Chen, wanted to confiscate the glass tubes. Mrs. Wen and Deng Qingkui pleaded repeatedly, but Detachment Leader Chen insisted that these were military supplies, and how could ordinary people have such things, saying that they must have been stolen from the train. As a result, they took the glass tubes and wrote down their names, saying, "If there are any problems, we will find you." After they left, the stall vendors discussed it and expressed their dissatisfaction. We ask, is this a violation of city policy?

    Answer: We are not clear about the use of the glass tubes mentioned in your letters; however, it is wrong for the Jiexiu Road Guard Detachment Leader to arbitrarily confiscate the belongings of ordinary people without going through government and established organizational procedures. If the items are indeed military supplies, the people should be persuaded to voluntarily hand them over to the government (the people should also comply with government laws and regulations and voluntarily hand them over). If they are public equipment, they should be requisitioned or purchased by the relevant authorities. Arbitrary confiscation will affect city discipline and city policy, and damage the government's prestige.

　　在新收复城市里工作
  　应严格遵守城市纪律
    编辑同志：
    在我们思想上有个解决不了的问题，即十一月二十二日左右，在介休城西关街北寺街门牌三号李启太的母亲温老人和邓清奎他二人摆的一个小摊上，有日本投降时拿下的两根玻璃管（长的有一尺五六寸，短的有七八寸）。同蒲铁路介休路卫分队八、九人，在陈分队长率领下，要将该玻璃管没收，温老人和邓清奎再三恳求，但陈队长硬说这是军用品，你们老百姓哪有这样东西，并说这一定是从火车上偷来的，结果把玻璃管拿走，还把他两人名字写下来说：“如有问题时，还找你们”。他们走后，小摊贩们纷纷议论表示不满。请问这是不是破坏城市政策？

    答：你俩来函中所提之玻璃管究系何用，我们不清楚；但介休路卫分队长不通过政府和一定组织手续，随便没收老百姓的东西是不对的。如该东西确系军用品，则应劝老百姓自动缴公（老百姓也应遵守政府法令、条规自动拿出来），如系公用器材，则应由有关当局征收或购买，随便没收将影响城市纪律和城市政策，损害政府威信。
