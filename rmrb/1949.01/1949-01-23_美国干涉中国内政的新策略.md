　　New U.S. Strategy for Interfering in China's Internal Affairs
　　Liao Gailong
    Washington's recent singing of the tune of "non-interference in China's internal affairs" is intended not only to conceal the past three years of the United States' frantic interference in China's internal affairs, but also to conceal the series of conspiracies the United States is currently undertaking to interfere in China's internal affairs. A dispatch from Washington by the Associated Press on the 16th of this month claimed: "Currently, U.S. foreign policy officials have decided that the United States should adhere to its current policy of non-interference in China." According to a United Press report from Washington on December 13th of last year: "U.S. foreign policy officials say that the United States will avoid any interference in China's internal affairs during the current crisis. It also says that this attitude of non-interference in the Chinese civil war is a reiteration of the U.S. support for the agreement on the China issue signed by the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union in Moscow three years ago. Former Secretary of State Byrnes at the time guaranteed the strict U.S. policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Foreign policy officials say that this guarantee still guides U.S. policy." But let's look at the facts.
    In the past three years, the U.S. government has equipped 117 divisions of the Kuomintang's civil war army (107 of which are fully equipped with U.S. weaponry); as of July 1946, the United States trained 140,000 to 150,000 personnel for the Kuomintang in thirteen departments, including navy, air force, infantry, artillery, engineering, transportation, automobile communications, paratroopers, secret service, traffic police, staff, military medicine, and military supplies; the United States used warships and airplanes to transport fourteen Kuomintang armies, forty-one divisions, and eight traffic police brigades, more than 540,000 people, to the front lines of the offensive against the liberated areas; 90,000 U.S. Marines landed and occupied important cities in China, building and guarding roads in North China for the Kuomintang's civil war army, and individually or in coordination with the Kuomintang army, invaded the liberated areas as many as 30 times from October 1945 to July 1946. Before and after Japan's surrender, the United States gave the Kuomintang government loans, materials, and service assistance for counter-revolutionary civil war totaling 5,914,400,000 U.S. dollars, of which the amount of assistance after Japan's surrender was 4,346,600,000 U.S. dollars. These military aids that the United States gave to the Kuomintang government are still going on and have not stopped or decreased. The above are some of the main facts of the United States' aid to Chiang Kai-shek in launching an unprecedented civil war to massacre the Chinese people, and some of the main facts of the U.S. reactionary government's frantic interference in China's internal affairs.
    The U.S. government tore to shreds the resolution of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in December 1945, which it had personally signed. The U.S. government thought that by providing such a large amount of killing weapons and war materials to the Kuomintang, it would be able to eliminate the Chinese people's patriotic and democratic forces and turn China into its colony. But the desperate interference of the United States has not subdued the Chinese people's liberation movement; on the contrary, it has accelerated the demise of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now, the Kuomintang traitorous army, fully armed by the United States, has collapsed, the cause of the Chinese people's liberation is about to triumph throughout the country, and a new, independent, democratic, and strong China is standing up on the Asian continent. Even the most reactionary American "Life Magazine" admitted on December 27th of last year: "Various news reports point to a historical fact, that is, the era of the Kuomintang has ended." The New York Herald Tribune wrote on December 31st of last year: "The military power of Nanjing has collapsed so quickly that many authorities now believe that resisting communism (referring to suppressing the Chinese people's liberation movement) in China is a failed endeavor."
    But even though the United States' policy of fervently interfering in China's internal affairs has failed shamefully, the United States has not intended to abandon its interference in China's internal affairs and stop its aid to the Kuomintang reactionary government. As early as the end of October last year, after the People's Liberation Army won a great victory in Liaoxi, Northeast China, the United States accelerated the shipment of civil war military supplies to the Kuomintang. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department announced that out of 125 million U.S. dollars of military aid to the Kuomintang, 105 million U.S. dollars had been allocated (Central News Agency, Washington, UPI dispatch, October 31st of last year). In November and December of last year, the value of the civil war military supplies that the United States shipped to the Kuomintang reached as much as 4 million U.S. dollars per week (Agence France-Presse, Washington, December 14th of last year). The U.S. government has repeatedly stated that its policy of continuing to aid the Kuomintang's civil war has not changed.
    The so-called "non-interfering in China's internal affairs" U.S. imperialism has recently and continuously increased its naval and Marine Corps forces to China. In October of last year, the United States increased the 36th Special Fleet to Qingdao, bringing the U.S. naval strength stationed in Qingdao to three aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and thirteen destroyers, and the number of naval personnel has increased to 9,700 (according to the London Daily Express, November 1st of last year). In November of last year, the United States again sent additional Marine Corps to China. The U.S. New York Herald Tribune on the 17th of the same month admitted: "After the United States sends an additional 1,250 Marine Corps to China, the total number of U.S. Marine Corps in China will reach 4,850. This is the largest concentration of U.S. Marine Corps on foreign soil at present." On December 10th of last year, Admiral Badger, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, officially announced in Shanghai that he would soon transport Marine Corps to Shanghai by transport ships, claiming that "Americans will come forward to maintain order when the (Kuomintang) authorities in Shanghai cannot control the situation," indicating that the U.S. Marine Corps will use the excuse that "the lives and property of American expatriates are threatened" to "land" in Shanghai at any time and carry out direct armed intervention. After Badger's statement, two companies of the 9th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, 695 people, arrived in Shanghai on December 16th. The Shanghai Kuomintang newspaper, Li Bao, reported on December 8th of last year that a new batch of 4,000 U.S. Marine Corps detachments were on their way to China from Saipan Island.
    The United States is organizing the remaining military forces of the Kuomintang traitorous government south of the Yangtze River and in remote provinces to resist the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and is preparing to directly occupy Taiwan and Hainan Island. Under the behind-the-scenes planning of the United States, the so-called "joint defense" plans of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces are being actively carried out. According to a dispatch from Washington by the Dentu News Agency on December 14th of last year, organizing Kuomintang warlords south of the Yangtze River to resist the People's Liberation Army is one of the main tasks of Hoffman, director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, during his visit to China. Hoffman came to China from December 11th to 15th of last year and held secret talks with Stuart and Chiang Kai-shek successively. According to Dentu News Agency, quoting reliable sources in Washington, before Hoffman came to China, the White House held consultations with the government on China policy and decided to adopt a "policy of fostering a warlord system in South and Central China." A UPI Shanghai dispatch on December 12th of last year, quoting sources from the Kuomintang Ministry of Foreign Affairs, revealed that the United States is plotting to directly arm and occupy Taiwan and Hainan Island. According to reports, the U.S. National Security Council has suggested to Truman that "defenses must be built on Taiwan and Hainan Island at all costs." During this period, the U.S. big bourgeoisie newspapers also mixed in with the crazy clamor for directly sending troops to help the Kuomintang, that is, the so-called "taking over the war in China."
    In addition to continuing to adopt the old methods of military aid and military intervention mentioned above, the U.S. government has also adopted a new method of instigating the Kuomintang reactionary government to carry out "peace" conspiracies. After Chiang Kai-shek, the number one public enemy of the Chinese people and war criminal, issued a reactionary "peace" statement, U.S. Ambassador to China Stuart publicly said: Chiang Kai-shek's "peace" proposal was what he had "always strived for" (UPI Shanghai dispatch, January 4th). Stuart here unreservedly said that Chiang Kai-shek's "peace" scam was directed by the U.S. government. Now, the United States is encouraging the removal of Chiang Kai-shek, that is, letting him retreat from the front stage of the counter-revolution to the backstage, as the U.S. imperialist propaganda machine, Columbia Broadcasting Corporation, said on December 31st of last year: "The cruel fact shows that the victory of the Communist Party is nearing completion. Chiang Kai-shek's only value to the 'nation' (referring to the United States' colonial country) is to maintain his personal status in retirement to continue serving the 'nation'." The task that Hoffman came to China to undertake, in addition to fostering the Kuomintang's remaining military forces in South China, was to instigate the Kuomintang "to propose a truce and peace talks to the People's Liberation Army, thereby seizing the initiative from the victorious People's Liberation Army and giving the wounded Kuomintang a chance to breathe" (according to a Dentu News Agency dispatch from London on December 6th of last year). This conspiracy of the U.S. interventionists was explained even more clearly in the U.S. "Foreign Policy Bulletin" published on December 26th of last year. The magazine said: "Nanjing may form a more 'liberal' regime, thereby negotiating peace with the Communist Party to establish a coalition government. This development may balance (referring to weaken) the power of the Communist Party, so as to prevent extremist policies and protect Chinese people who are friendly to us (referring to American running dogs, traitors, and national betrayers)."
    Since the U.S. government's "peace" plan is to preserve the counter-revolutionary forces in China, how embarrassed the U.S. imperialists were when the Chinese Communist Party put forward the first list of Chinese civil war war criminals on December 25th of last year! At that time, U.S. Undersecretary of State Lovett and Truman himself disregarded their mask of "non-interference in China's internal affairs" and issued statements one after another, defending executioners like Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren who had massacred millions of Chinese people, and slandered the Chinese People's Liberation Army's measures to punish war criminals as "not the opinion of the people of civilized countries in the world." The "civilized" U.S. imperialists who took pleasure in the massacre of millions of Chinese people barked wildly because they were trying to preserve the counter-revolutionary forces in China.
    But the U.S. imperialists have after all felt their bankruptcy in front of the Chinese people. In order to adopt new methods to interfere in China's internal affairs, they once tried to pull other countries to be their partners, thus creating the atmosphere of the so-called "four-nation mediation" of the Chinese civil war by the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, as well as the atmosphere that the United Nations Security Council was going to discuss the China issue. Under the direct instructions of Stuart, Wu Tiecheng, the war criminal and foreign minister of the Kuomintang puppet government, submitted formal memorandums to the ambassadors of the four countries on the 8th of this month, requesting the four governments to "mediate" the Chinese civil war. The Soviet Union, which has always followed a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, had already sternly refuted the absurd rumor that the Soviet Union could consider such a proposal from the Kuomintang government on December 31st, 1948. On the 17th of this month, the Soviet government officially replied to the Nanjing government, pointing out that "the Soviet government has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and believes that undertaking the mediation proposed in the above-mentioned memorandum is inappropriate." Precisely because of this, the activities of the Kuomintang government focused on the governments of the U.S., Britain, and France, especially the U.S. government. But the Kuomintang government did not dare to publicly announce its actions in this regard, and the governments of the U.S., Britain, and France and the Secretariat of the United Nations did not dare to publicly announce their positions in this regard. These responsible personnel of foreign governments and United Nations organizations know that if they dare to take any formal steps to interfere in China's internal affairs, they will encounter a head-on blow from the Chinese people who uphold national dignity.
    In fact, the U.S. imperialists have now calculated that no matter what military interventions and "peace" conspiracies the U.S. government implements, the demise of the Kuomintang government cannot be saved. Therefore, U.S. imperialists with "foresight" are wooing a part of the right-wing elements of the liberal bourgeoisie who have ties with Chinese and foreign counter-revolutionary forces, instructing them to infiltrate the revolutionary camp and organize the so-called "powerful and effective opposition" against the Chinese Communist Party. Hoffman's statement in Shanghai on December 13th of last year was an important signal of this conspiracy. The statement said: "If free elements and parties have universal representation in the coalition government," "the United States may assist the coalition government, including the Communist Party." The "free elements and parties" in the mouths of the U.S. imperialists clearly refer to some people who only superficially support democracy but are actually people who have infiltrated the democratic camp as successors to Chinese and foreign counter-revolutionary forces. On November 17th of last year, Newsweek, which represents Wall Street financial groups, wrote: "Since some new anti-Chiang coalition government will soon be formed in China, the State Department is seeking ways to make friends with any new regime that may emerge after Chiang is forced to step down. This hope is more concentrated on those military and liberal political figures who seem certain to become prominent in any new government." The New York Herald Tribune, which is recognized as often reflecting the policy of the U.S. State Department, blatantly said: "The Communist Party rules China, there must be many opposition parties, and the anti-communist forces can make a comeback." The newspaper said in an editorial entitled "The Climax of Tensions in China" on December 17th: "The United States has no other roads to choose from, only to let things develop naturally until the opportunity to replace the Communist government (referring to the people's democratic government led by the Chinese Communist Party) with a government in proper form appears. … The United States should look for signs of weaknesses in the Communist regime and prepare to help the enemies of Chinese communism." Look! This is the true face of the U.S. imperialists who are preparing to "make friends" with the Chinese people, and this is the true face of the U.S. imperialists who adopt a "policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs."
    The U.S. imperialists arrogantly believe that in addition to using military intervention and political intervention methods, they can also use monetary intervention methods to overwhelm the People's Republic of China led by the Chinese Communist Party. Hoffman and other spokespersons of the American reactionaries foolishly believe that such a great China with so abundant resources and so large population, after eradicating the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, under the leadership of the working people and their vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, still cannot be built into an industrialized country. They fantasize that the Chinese people cannot survive without relying on U.S. dollars, so the Chinese People's Government, like the reactionary governments of Britain, France, and even the Kuomintang in China, will succumb to the power of U.S. dollars. Not only open imperialist elements like Hoffman hold such ideas, but also "liberal" elements in the Nation and the New Republic. The "Nation" magazine published on December 25th of last year said: "Seeing the economic difficulties in China, the Communist Party may welcome continued U.S. aid, so even if a Communist Party government is established, Washington can still exert some influence in China, at least for a period of time." The "New Republic Weekly" published on December 15th of last year said: "China will need a lot of assistance and restoration economically, and this assistance can only come from the United States and the Soviet Union, and we (referring to the United States) are more qualified to provide this assistance. If we are smart and generous, we have the opportunity to help China avoid totalitarianism (referring to the new democracy that opposes imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to the end)." We must pay close attention to the fact that the U.S. imperialists' work to "exert some influence" among those who superficially support democratic China is not completely without results. On December 16th of last year, an Associated Press reporter reported from Hong Kong: "An 'independent' who has known the reporter for fifteen years said: China is too big and too unmanageable to be 'manipulated' by one group, even the Communist Party, for very long. … China will need industrial assistance to improve people's lives, whether it is ruled by monkeys, angels, or the Communist Party. Such assistance will only come from the United States, and the Communist Party knows this. Thus, the only hope harbored by the 'liberal elements' in China is that they can use these factors to make the Communist Party leave totalitarianism and maintain China's traditional personal freedom (referring to China's feudalism and compradorism)."
    The above is the whole set of intervention plans that U.S. imperialism is actively carrying out under the smoke screen of "non-interference in China's internal affairs," and this is the whole set of new strategies that the U.S. government is currently adopting to continue to be enemies with the Chinese people.
    There is no doubt that the Chinese people, who have awakened and united in the great liberation movement, will resolutely smash this new conspiracy of the U.S. government, just as they smashed the U.S. imperialists' military intervention. The victory of the Chinese people over the Kuomintang and U.S. imperialism can not only achieve complete political independence, but also achieve complete economic independence. The U.S. government's political conspiracies and monetary enticements will not achieve any success except for buying off a few useless Chinese scum.

　　美国干涉中国内政的新策略
    廖盖隆
    华盛顿最近唱出的“不干涉中国内政”的歌子，其目的不但是想要掩饰过去三年来美国对中国内政的疯狂干涉，而且是企图掩饰目前美国正在进行的干涉中国内政的一连串的阴谋。本月十六日美联社自华盛顿发出的电讯声称：“目前美国外交政策官员已决定美国应恪守其目前对华的不干涉政策。”又据去年十二月十三日合众社自华盛顿报导：“美国外交官员们说：美国将避免在目前危机时对中国内政进行任何干涉。又说：对中国内战的这种不干涉态度，系重申美国支持三年前在莫斯科签订的美英苏三国对中国问题的协议。前国务卿贝尔纳斯当时曾保证美国不干涉中国内政的严格政策。外交官员说：这个保证仍指导着美国的政策。”但是请看看事实吧。
    在过去三年中，美国政府装备了国民党内战军队一百一十七个师（其中一百零七个师是全美械装备）；截至一九四六年七月为止，美国为国民党训练了包括海、空、步、炮、工、辎、汽车通讯、伞兵、特务、交通警察、参谋、军医、军需等十三个部门的人员十四万至十五万人之多；美国用军舰、飞机把国民党军十四个军四十一个师和八个交通警察总队，五十四万余人，运到进攻解放区的前线上；九万的美国陆战队曾登陆占驻中国的重要城市，在华北为国民党的内战军队筑路、护路，并在一九四五年十月至一九四六年七月为止的时间内单独或协同国民党军侵犯解放区达三十次之多。日本投降前后美国给予国民党政府从事反革命内战的贷款、物资及服务援助达到五十九亿一千四百余万美元，其中日本投降后的援助数目则为四十三亿四千六百余万美元。美国给予国民党政府的这些军事性的援助，直到现在还在继续着，并没有停止或减少。以上所述，就是美国援助蒋介石发动屠杀中国人民的空前内战的几项主要的事实，就是美国反动政府疯狂干涉中国内政的几项主要的事实。
    美国政府把一九四五年十二月它所亲自签字的莫斯科三国外长会议的决议撕得粉碎。美国政府以为拿这样大量的杀人武器和战争物资援助国民党，就能够消灭中国人民的爱国民主力量，把中国变成它的殖民地。但是美国的拼命干涉并没有压服中国人民的解放运动，相反地是加速了国民党反动派的灭亡。现在，为美国所全副武装起来的国民党卖国贼军队已经崩溃了，中国人民的解放事业即将在全国胜利，一个新的独立、民主、强盛的中国正在亚洲大陆上站起来。甚至美国最反动的“生活杂志”在去年十二月二十七日也承认：“各项消息指出了一件历史性的事实，即是国民党的时代已经结束。”纽约先驱论坛报在去年十二月三十一日也写着：“南京的军事力量竟崩溃得这样快，以至于许多权威方面现在相信在中国抵抗共产主义（按指镇压中国人民解放运动）是一件已经失败了的事情。”
    但尽管美国狂热干涉中国内政的政策已经可耻地破产，美国并未打算放弃对中国内政的干涉和停止对国民党反动政府的援助。早在去年十月底，当人民解放军在东北辽西大捷之后，美国就加速赶运内战军火给国民党。美国务院发言人宣布，一亿二千五百万美元的对国民党军事援助中，已拨交一亿零五百万美元（中央社去年十月三十一日华盛顿合众电）。去年十一月及十二月，美国运交国民党的内战军火，其价值每周达到四百万美元之多（法新社华盛顿去年十二月十四日电）。美国政府并一再声明继续援助国民党内战的政策未变。
    所谓“不干涉中国内政”的美国帝国主义，最近时期接连增调海军及海军陆战队至中国。去年十月间美国增调第三十六特种舰队至青岛，使美国占驻青岛的海军实力已增为三艘航空母舰、四艘巡洋舰、十三艘驱逐舰，海军人数已增为九千七百人（据去年十一月一日伦敦每日快报）。去年十一月间美国又增派海军陆战队驻华。同月十七日的美国纽约先驱论坛报承认：“美国加派一千二百五十名海军陆战队赴华后，将使美国在华海军陆战队总数达到四千八百五十人。此乃美国海军陆战队现时在外国土地上最大的一个集中力量。”去年十二月十日，美国西太平洋海军舰队总司令白吉尔在上海正式宣布，即将以运输舰载送海军陆战队至沪，声言“在沪市（国民党）当局不能控制局势时将用美国人出而维持”，表示美国海军陆战队将借口“美侨生命财产受威胁”而随时“登陆”上海，实行直接的武装干涉。在白吉尔声明之后，驻青美海军陆战队第九团的两个连六百九十五人已于十二月十六日抵达上海。上海国民党的报纸立报去年十二月八日并报导：新的一批为数四千人的美国海军陆战队分遣队正自塞班岛来华途中。
    美国正在组织长江以南及边远省份的国民党卖国政府的残余军事力量抵抗中国人民解放军，并准备直接占领台湾和海南岛。在美国的幕后策动下，广东、福建、江西、湖南、广西、云南、贵州、四川等省的所谓“联防”计划正在积极进行。据去年十二月十四日电通社自华盛顿报导，组织长江以南国民党军阀抵抗解放军，乃是美国经济合作总署署长霍夫曼来华活动的主要任务之一。霍夫曼系于去年十二月十一日至十五日来华，曾与司徒雷登及蒋介石先后密谈。据电通社引华盛顿可靠人士的话说：霍来华前，白宫曾举行对华政府的会商，决定采行“在华南华中扶植军阀制度”。去年十二月十二日合众社上海电引国民党外交部人士透露，美国正阴谋直接武装侵占台湾及海南岛，据报导：美国国家安全委员会已向杜鲁门建议，“必须以一切代价在台湾和海南岛建设防务”。在此期间，美国大资产阶级的报界，并夹杂有直接出兵帮助国民党，即所谓“接管中国战事”的疯狂叫嚣。
    美国政府除了继续采取上述的军事援助和军事干涉的旧方法以外，还采取了策动国民党反动政府进行“和平”阴谋的新方法。在中国人民第一号公敌战犯蒋介石发出反动的“求和”声明之后，美国驻华大使司徒雷登公开说：蒋介石的“和平”提议便是他“过去所一直努力以求的东西”（合众社一月四日上海电）。司徒雷登在这里毫不讳言蒋介石的“和平”骗局是由美国政府之手导演出来的。现在，美国正鼓动去掉蒋介石，即是说让他从反革命舞台的前台退到后台去，如同美国帝国主义的宣传机关哥伦比亚广播公司去年十二月三十一日所说的：“残酷的事实显示，共产党的胜利已接近完成，蒋介石对‘国家’（按指美国的殖民地国家）的唯一价值是，使他个人的地位在退隐中仍保持对‘国家’的效劳。”霍夫曼来华所负的任务，除了扶植华南的国民党的残余军事力量之外，便是策动国民党“向人民解放军提出停战议和，因而从胜利者的人民解放军手中夺取主动权，给受创伤的国民党以喘息的机会”（据电通社去年十二月六日伦敦电）。美国干涉者的这个阴谋，在去年十二月二十六日出版的美国“外交政策公报”上说得尤为明白。该杂志说：“南京可能组成比较‘自由主义’的政权，从而和共产党谈判和平成立联合政府，这种发展可能平衡（按指削弱）共产党的力量，借以防止极端主义的政策，并且保护对我们友好的中国人（按指美国的走狗汉奸卖国贼）。”
    美国政府的“和平”计划既然是要保存中国的反革命势力，因此，当中国共产党在去年十二月二十五日提出第一批中国内战战犯名单的时候，美国帝国主义者是多么狼狈呀！当时的美国副国务卿罗维特和杜鲁门自己顾不得他们的“不干涉中国内政”的假面具了，先后发表了声明，为蒋介石李宗仁这一类屠杀了成百万中国人民的刽子手辩护，并诬蔑中国人民解放军惩办战犯的措施为“不是世界文明国家人民的意见”。以成百万中国人民被屠杀为快乐的“文明”的美国帝国主义者们的所以狂吠起来，就是因为他们妄想保存中国的反革命势力。
    但是美国帝国主义者毕竟是已经感觉到自己在中国人民面前的破产了。他们为了采取新的方法干涉中国内政，曾经企图拉出旁的国家来做自己的伙伴，因此制造了所谓美、英、法、苏“四国调解”中国内战的空气，以及联合国安全理事会将要讨论中国问题的空气。在司徒雷登的直接指示下，国民党伪政府外交部长战犯吴铁城已于本月八日以正式备忘录分别提交四国驻华大使，要求四国政府“调解”中国内战。一贯遵循不干涉各国内政政策的苏联，早在一九四八年十二月三十一日就严正地驳斥了所谓苏联可以考虑国民党政府的这种提议的荒谬谣言。本月十七日，苏联政府已正式复函南京政府，指出“苏联政府始终恪守不干涉他国内政的原则，认为承担上述备忘录所提出的居间调停是不适宜的”。正因为如此，国民党政府的活动就着重在美、英、法三国政府，特别是美国政府方面。但是国民党政府既不敢公开宣布自己在这一方面的行动，美、英、法三国政府和联合国秘书处也不敢公开宣布自己在这一方面的立场。这些外国政府和联合国组织的负责人员们知道：如果他们敢于采取任何正式干涉中国内政的步骤，他们将遇到维护民族尊严的中国人民的迎头痛击。
    事实上美国帝国主义者现在已经计算到，无论美国政府实行什么军事干涉和“和平”阴谋，国民党政府的灭亡还是挽救不了的。因此，有“远见”的美国帝国主义者正在拉拢一部分与中外反革命势力有联系的自由资产阶级右翼分子，指示他们钻入革命阵营，组织反对中国共产党的所谓“强大有效的反对派”。去年十二月十三日霍夫曼在上海发表的声明，就是这个阴谋的一个重要的信号。这个声明说：“如果自由分子和党派在联合政府中有普遍的代表”，“美国可能援助包括共产党在内的联合政府”。美国帝国主义者口里的“自由分子及党派”，显然是指一些仅仅在表面上拥护民主，实则是作为中外反革命势力的继承人而混入民主阵营的人们。去年十一月十七日，代表华尔街财阀的新闻周刊写道：“由于某种新的反蒋联合政府不久即将在中国形成，国务院刻正寻求与任何蒋被迫下野后可能出现的新政权交朋友的方法。这种希望更多地集中于那些似乎一定会在任何新政府中显赫起来的军人和自由主义的政治人物身上。”被公认为时常反映美国国务院政策的纽约先驱论坛报露骨地说：“中共统治中国，反对派必甚多，反共力量可以东山再起。”该报十二月十七日在题为“中国紧张局势的高潮”的社论中说：“美国没有其他道路可资选择，只有让事情自然地发展，直到以形式合宜的政府去换掉共产党政府（按指中国共产党所领导的人民民主政府）的机会出现为止。……美国应当寻找共产党政权中弱点的迹象，准备帮助中国共产主义的敌人。”看吧！这就是准备同中国人民“交朋友”的美国帝国主义的真面目，这就是采取“不干涉中国内政政策”的美国帝国主义的真面目。
    美国帝国主义者狂妄地以为除了使用军事干涉和政治干涉的方法之外，还可以使用金元干涉的方法来压倒中国共产党所领导的中华人民民主共和国。霍夫曼和其他美国反动派的代言人愚蠢地以为：资源如此丰富、人口如此众多的伟大的中国，在铲除了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫以后，在劳动人民及其先锋队中国共产党领导之下，还不能建设成为工业化的国家。他们妄想：中国人民除了依靠美元就不能生存，因此中国人民政府也就象英国的、法国的甚至象中国国民党的反动政府那样，屈服于美元的势力之下。抱着这样想法的不但有霍夫曼这样的公开的帝国主义分子，而且有民族周刊和新共和周刊中的“自由主义”分子。去年十二月二十五日出版的“民族”周刊说：“看到中国经济这样危难的情形，共产党也许可能欢迎美国的继续援助，所以即使一个共产党掌权的政府成立，华盛顿仍可在中国运用一些势力，至少在一个时期内。”去年十二月十五日出版的“新共和周刊”说：“中国在经济上将需要许多援助与复兴，这种援助只能来自美国与苏联，而我们（指美国）更具备作这种援助的条件。如果我们是聪明而慷慨的，我们就有机会帮助中国避免极权主义（按指反对帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义到底的新民主主义）。”必须十分警惕地注意：美国帝国主义者在那些表面上拥护民主中国的人们中间“运用一些势力”的工作，并不是完全没有结果的。去年十二月十六日一个美联社记者自香港报导：“一位与记者相识十五年之久的‘独立分子’说：中国是太大了，太无法管理了，不会被一个集团甚至是共产党‘操纵’到很久。……中国将需要工业援助以改善人民生活，不管他是被猴子、被天使还是被共产党统治着。这样的援助将仅能来自美国，共产党也知道这一点。这样中国‘自由主义分子’所怀抱的唯一希望，就是他们能用这些因素使共产党离开极权主义，并保持中国传统的个人自由（按指中国的封建主义与买办主义）。”
    以上所述，就是美国帝国主义在“不干涉中国内政”的烟幕下所积极进行的一整套的干涉计划，这就是目前时期美国政府所采取的继续与中国人民为敌的一整套的新策略。
    毫无疑问，业已在伟大的解放运动中觉悟起来与团结起来的中国人民，会象粉碎美国帝国主义的军事干涉一样，坚决地粉碎美国政府这种新阴谋。中国人民对于国民党和美国帝国主义的胜利，不独在政治上可以取得完全的独立，而且也可以在经济上取得完全的独立。美国政府的政治阴谋与金元引诱，除开收买几个不中用的中国的败类而外，是不会获得任何成功的。
