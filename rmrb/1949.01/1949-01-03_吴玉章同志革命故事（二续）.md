　　Comrade Wu Yuzhang's Revolutionary Story (Continued, Part Two)
    He Qifang
  　Eliminating Evils in Chongqing
    After settling things in Neijiang in a week, Comrade Wu Yuzhang hurried to Chongqing overnight because the revolutionaries in Chongqing were urgently calling for him in letters and telegrams. The day he arrived in Chongqing, he encountered Lin Weisheng, who was armed and causing a disturbance at the governor-general's office, saying he wanted to fight Vice Governor-General Xia Zhishi to the death. Fortunately, Xia was not there, and nothing happened. Lin was originally a company commander under Xia in the New Army. When Xia launched the uprising, he was afraid that Lin would not obey, so he shot and wounded Lin's leg. At that time, Lin quickly said, "I am also a revolutionary and willing to participate in the uprising." After Chongqing was captured, Xia became the vice governor-general and gave Lin the nominal title of commander-in-chief. Because Chengdu had not yet been recovered, the Chongqing Shu Military Government sent Lin and Dan Maoxin each to lead a detachment to capture Chengdu. Lin felt that the title of detachment leader was too small, so he wanted to make trouble with Xia. At that time, Lin was very overbearing in Chongqing, and he also colluded with bandits, often engaging in illegal activities that disturbed the people, causing unrest in Chongqing. After Comrade Wu Yuzhang arrived, Governor-General Zhang Peijue immediately asked him what to do. He said sternly: Military discipline should be strictly enforced immediately, revolutionary discipline should be implemented, and a meeting should be held to discuss what happened that day, and at the same time, a military tribunal should be held to enforce military discipline.
    Zhang Peijue agreed with this idea. It was already late at night, but he immediately ordered all military and political personnel to be convened for a meeting, forbidding them to carry weapons, and instructing the guards to be vigilant.
    At the meeting, Xia Zhishi reported on the incident and asked everyone to discuss a solution. Lin Weisheng didn't care at all. He stood up and said loudly, "I, Lin Weisheng, have many crimes! Attacking officials in defense, that's one crime; tearing up commissions, that's two crimes; hitting the governor-general, that's three crimes; disrupting the military government, that's four crimes. Let's see what you dare do to me, Lin Weisheng!" He was aggressive and sat down after speaking. For a long time, no one dared to stand up and speak.
    Seeing this situation, Comrade Wu Yuzhang stood up calmly and said:
    "The purpose of our Revolutionary Alliance is to overthrow the Manchu Qing autocracy, implement democratic politics, and relieve the people's suffering, not to replace violence with violence. We revolutionaries do not insult the widowed and orphaned, nor do we fear the powerful. Upholding justice and fighting for the oppressed is the true nature of us revolutionaries. If we act tyrannically and like the Manchu Qing officials as soon as we win, it really goes against the original intention of the revolution…"
    Comrade Wu Yuzhang spoke passionately for two hours, and finally advocated implementing revolutionary discipline and turning this meeting into a military tribunal. The whole audience applauded warmly, expressing their agreement. At this time, Lin Weisheng looked at him in surprise, wondering where this stranger came from and how he could speak so well.
    Then Xia Zhishi said, "I am personally involved, so it is inconvenient for me to advocate for a trial. I suggest that we ask Mr. Sun Yat-sen's friend who recently returned from Japan, our senior revolutionary, Comrade Yuzhang, to be the chief judge."
    Everyone expressed their approval again.
    This was something Comrade Wu Yuzhang had not expected. He thought: I advocate strict military discipline, doesn't that mean I have to deal with matters of life and death? Then he thought: If I decline, no one else will do it, how will the matter be resolved? After considering it in his heart, he said that he was willing to accept, but he had four conditions to agree on with everyone:
    "First, I must obtain everyone's agreement when explaining the criminal behavior; second, the punishment I impose must also be agreed upon by everyone; third, after the verdict, the criminal must be allowed to appeal or declare disagreement and explain the reasons for disagreement; fourth, the verdict must be implemented. If everyone agrees with these four conditions, then I can take office."
    Everyone said, "This is the fairest trial method, we agree."
    So, dozens of people formed a tribunal and began to proceed solemnly. Comrade Wu Yuzhang explained in detail that Lin Weisheng's criminal behavior violated the revolutionary purpose, endangered the people, and was tantamount to attempting to overthrow the revolutionary military government, and should be sentenced to death according to the military law stipulated by the military government. He asked if everyone agreed, and everyone agreed again. Then he asked Lin if he pleaded guilty and gave him two minutes to speak. But Lin remained silent. It was extended for another five minutes, but he still didn't speak. After urging him several times, he finally said, "Saying I want to overthrow the military government, I don't have that intention."
    Comrade Wu Yuzhang said, "I can't know if you have that intention. But crime is based on action, and your actions are endangering the military government."
    He had nothing else to say. So Comrade Wu Yuzhang asked Xia Zhishi to execute the judgment. However, Xia hesitated and gave a few words, saying that a special provision should be made. He meant that since the trial was specially set up, the execution should also be specially set up. Because he didn't say it clearly, some people thought it was a "special pardon." They turned around to defend Lin Weisheng, saying that Lin was also a participant in the uprising and should be treated with special leniency and pardoned.
    Comrade Wu Yuzhang firmly opposed, saying that they were violating the conditions they had agreed upon earlier, and they were overturning what everyone had agreed upon themselves. After an hour of debate, there was still no result. One radical revolutionary said angrily, "If you are so cowardly and timid, I will use a bomb to kill you all." Everyone opposed him. Comrade Wu Yuzhang said, "There is no need to be impatient; let me ask, who can guarantee that Lin Weisheng, such an unreasonable person, will not cause trouble?"
    At this time, a regimental commander surnamed Su stood up and said, "I guarantee him, our Fourth Regiment guarantees him."
    Before he finished speaking, several soldiers in the guard said in unison, "This is the worst thing!" Because there were many people around, any slight disturbance would cause the knives and guns to rub against each other, making noise. Commander Su thought that the soldiers were going to hit him, so he quickly lowered his head to hide, and accidentally hit the corner of the table, causing blood to flow out. Everyone thought the soldiers had opened fire and hurried to escape. So only Comrade Wu Yuzhang, Zhang Peijue, Xia Zhishi, and Lin Weisheng were left in the venue. Lin also joined them in persuading the soldiers to be quiet. The guard said, "That Commander Su is the one who advised Commander Lin to do bad things." Comrade Wu Yuzhang said, "Let's detain Commander Su for the time being and deal with it separately. We still have to end this case tonight."
    So everyone was invited back. Fortunately, the military government was heavily guarded, and no one had escaped. After everyone was seated, Comrade Wu Yuzhang, because Lin Weisheng had not taken advantage of the disturbance to escape or had any other bad behavior, also had the intention of punishing him leniently. So he discussed it with everyone, and finally decided to immediately remove him from his post and send someone to send him back to his hometown in Hubei.
    This incident fully demonstrated the weakness and powerlessness of the revolutionary military government at that time, and also demonstrated the timidity and compromise of these revolutionaries at that time. However, after this solemn and firm trial by Comrade Wu Yuzhang, the Chongqing Shu Military Government was finally temporarily consolidated, and more importantly, the citizens of Chongqing were happy to have removed a scourge for them.

　　吴玉章同志革命故事（二续）
    何其芳
  　到重庆除害
    吴玉章同志在内江一星期，把许多事情布置妥当，即连夜赶到重庆。因为当时重庆的革命党人函电催他前去。到重庆那一天，就遇到林畏生持枪在都督府大闹，说要和副都督夏之时拼命，好在夏不在，没有出事。林在新军中原是夏的连长，夏起义时怕林不从，曾枪击过他，只打伤了腿。当时林赶快就说：“我也是革命党人，愿意一同举事。”攻下重庆后，夏为副都督，给林以总司令名议。以成都尚未光复，重庆蜀军政府派林与但懋辛各率一支队进取成都。林认为支队长名义太小，故要找夏大闹。林当时在重庆很跋扈，并且和匪徒勾结，常有不法行为扰民，使重庆人心不安。吴玉章同志到后，正都督张培爵即问他怎么办。他严正地说：应该立刻严肃军纪，执行革命纪律，开一个会议来讨论这天发生的事情，并同时开军事裁判会议执行军纪。
    张培爵同意这个意见。时已深夜，但仍立刻下令召集军政全体人员开会，不许携带武器，并叫守卫妥为戒备。
    会开时，由夏之时报告事情发生经过，请全体讨论解决。林畏生毫不在意，站起来大声说：“我林畏生罪多得很！砍官防，其罪一也；撕委任状，其罪二也；打都督，其罪三也；闹军政府，其罪四也。看你们敢把我林畏生怎么样！”他气势汹汹，说完就坐下。过了许久都没有人敢起来发言。
    吴玉章同志看见这种情形，就从容站起来说：
    “我们革命同盟会的宗旨是推翻满清专制，实行民主政治，解除人民痛苦，并不是以暴易暴。我们革命党人是不侮鳏寡，不畏强暴的。扶正义，打抱不平，正是我们革命党人的本色。如果我们今天刚一胜利，就横行霸道，和满清官吏一样，实在违反革命初衷。……”
    吴玉章同志慷慨沉痛地讲了两小时，最后主张执行革命的纪律，把这个会议变为军事裁判。全场热烈鼓掌，表示同意。这时林畏生惊异地看着他，心想那来这样一个陌生人，这样会讲话。
    随着夏之时说：“我本身就是当事人，不便主张裁判。我建议请新近由日本回来的中山先生的朋友，我们革命的老前辈，玉章同志作裁判长。”
    大家又表示赞成。
    这是吴玉章同志所没有料到的。他想：我是主张厉行军纪的，这岂不是杀人的事情要我来作吗？他接着又想：如果推辞，旁人是一定不会干的，事情又怎么解决呢？他在自己心里这样考虑了一下，就说他愿意接受，但有四个条件与大家相约：
    “第一，我说明犯罪的行为时必须得众人的同意；第二，我判决的处罚也必须得众人的同意；第三，判决后罪人得申诉或声明不服，并说明不服的理由；第四，判决后一定要遵照实行。如果大家都赞成这四个条件，我才能就职。”
    大家都说：“这是最公平的裁判法，我们赞成。”
    于是几十个人组成裁判会就开始严肃地进行了。吴玉章同志详细说明林畏生的犯罪行为违背革命宗旨，危害人民，无异企图推翻革命军政府，应照军政府规定的军法处以死刑。问大家同不同意，大家又赞成。于是又问林是否服罪，限二分钟让他讲话。林却沉默着。又延长五分钟，他仍不讲话。催他几次，他才说：“说我想推翻军政府，我没有这个心思。”
    吴玉章同志说：“我不能知道你有没有这个心思。但犯罪是以行动为标准，你的行动是危害军政府的。”
    他再也没有话讲了。于是吴玉章同志请夏之时执行判决。夏却犹疑不决地起来讲了几句话，说应该特设什么什么的。他的意思是说，裁判既是特设的，执行也应该特设。因为他说得不清楚，有些人就以为是“特赦”。他们就又反过来为林畏生辩护，说林也是起义的人，应该特别从宽处理，赦免他。
    吴玉章同志坚决反对，说他们违背刚才相约的条件，大家同意了的却又自己来推翻。辩论了一小时，还是没有结果。有一个激烈的革命党人愤慨地说：“象你们这样懦弱畏缩，我就拿炸弹来把大家炸死算了。”大家又纷纷反对他。吴玉章同志说：“不必性急；我试问林畏生这样蛮不讲理的人，谁能保他不作乱事呢？”
    这时有一姓苏的团长起来说：“我保他，我们四团人保他。”
    他话还没有说完，卫队中几个士兵就一齐说：“就是这东西最坏！”因为四周人多，稍一惊动，就挤得刀枪摩擦作响，苏团长以为士兵们要打他，急忙把头低下去躲藏，一下子碰到桌角上血流出来了。大家以为士兵们开了枪，都赶快逃避。于是会场上就只剩下吴玉章同志、张培爵、夏之时和林畏生四个人。林也和他们一起劝士兵们安静。卫兵说：“就是那苏团长劝林司令做坏事。”吴玉章同志说：“现在暂把苏团长扣下，另案办理。今晚还是要把这个案子结束。”
    于是又把大家请了回来。好在军政府戒备很严，还没有一个人逃出去。大家坐定后，吴玉章同志因为林畏生并未趁这次扰乱逃走或者有旁的不好表现，也就有从轻处罚他的意思了。于是就和大家商量，最后决定立刻解除他的职务，并且派人送他回湖北原籍。
    这件事情充分表现出来了当时的革命军政府的软弱无力，也表现出来了当时的这些革命党人的畏缩、妥协。然而，经过了吴玉章同志这一严正坚定的裁判，重庆的蜀军政府总算得到了暂时的巩固，更重要的是重庆的市民都高兴为他们除去了一个祸害。　　　　　　　（本节完，全文未完）
