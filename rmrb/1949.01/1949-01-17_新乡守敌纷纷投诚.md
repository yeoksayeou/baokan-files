【Taihang, 11th】Since the liberation of Xuzhou, the morale of the Kuomintang troops besieged in the isolated island of Xinxiang has been increasingly shaken, and they have come over to our side in droves. Following the defection of Xie, the Third Battalion Commander of the First Regiment of the Security First Brigade of the enemy's "West Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters," (a temporary Kuomintang formation) along with 29 men on December 9th of last year, seven more enemy soldiers surrendered to us on the 11th. At dawn on New Year's Day, Li Yan-kong, the Squad Leader of the First Squad of the Third Company of the First Battalion of the Security First Brigade, stationed on the city defense, led 28 men, carrying three light machine guns and 20 rifles and pistols, in a collective surrender to a certain unit of the Yubei People's Liberation Army. Upon hearing of Li's defection, the × Squad of that unit secretly made plans to escape to Shili Pu in Xiuwu and gather to surrender to us. Eight men have already arrived. On the night of the 5th, more than 30 men of the First Infantry Company of the Service Battalion of the 12th Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang Army, stationed at the south entrance of Xinxiang Airport, led by a lieutenant platoon leader, collectively escaped from the pit of fire with their weapons.

【Taihang, 11th】Under the powerful political offensive launched by our Yubei Party, government, and military, as well as the "Call Sons and Demand Husbands" movement and the magnanimous policy, desertions among the Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers are rampant. Many have defected to the liberated areas. In an incomplete statistic from mid-November to early December of last year, the number of enemy troops who deserted and returned home (their homes being in the liberated areas) or directly surrendered to us reached more than 1,800. This includes 870 men from the Bo'ai, Xinxiang, and Anyang regimental districts directly under the Yubei Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Division (the remnants of the above-mentioned enemy regimental districts were incorporated into the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit 40th Army in early December), 400 men from the First, Second, and Third Battalions of the First Regiment of the Security First Brigade, which was temporarily formed into the "West Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters," a portion of the remnants of the Wuzhi Security Regiment, 100 men from the remnants of the Xiuwu Security Regiment, 90 men from the reconnaissance company of the 318th Regiment of the 40th Army, and more than 200 men from the Second Battalion (formerly the enemy Hui County Special Agent Battalion) of the 115th Regiment of the same army. The Xinxiang bandit chiefs, facing death, are extremely fearful of our powerful political offensive combined with military encirclement. Zhang Jingzhong, the bandit Security Commander of the Fourth Special District and Commander of the Xinxiang City Defense, stated in panic at a certain military officers' meeting that the Liberation Army's magnanimous policy was "truly frightening" and that "if this continues, the army (referring to the bandit army) will collapse completely." Although the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have tried every means to suppress and strictly control the situation, they still cannot stop the collective desertion or surrender of their subordinates. The soldiers have gradually seen through the fate that the Xinxiang Chiang Kai-shek bandits will soon be completely annihilated by the Liberation Army. They have begun to realize that there is no second way out except surrender.

　　新乡守敌纷纷投诚
    【太行十一日电】自徐州解放后，困守新乡孤岛的国民党军愈益动摇，纷纷前来反正。继年前十二月九日国民党临时编成之敌“西路剿匪总队”保安第一旅一团三大队队长谢员绩率部二十九人反正后，十一日续有七个敌士兵向我投诚。元旦拂晓驻守城防之保一旅一团一大队三中队一分队队长李延空率部二十八人，携带轻机枪三挺，长短枪二十支集体向我豫北人民解放军某部投诚。该部×分队闻悉李部投我后，当夜开到飞机场，密定分别逃至修武十里铺集合投我，现已到达八人，五日夜驻守新乡飞机场南口之国民党十二绥区勤务营步兵第一连，在中尉排长率领下三十余人携械集体逃出火坑。
    【太行十一日电】在我豫北党政军民大力开展政治攻势、叫子索夫运动的声威与宽大政策感召下，蒋匪士兵逃跑成风。并有不少投奔解放区。从年前十一月中旬，至十二月上旬止的不完全统计，逃跑返乡（家在解放区）或直接投我的敌军已达一千八百余人。计有豫北蒋匪师管区直辖的博爱、新乡、安阳三个团管区八百七十人，获嘉团管区一部（上述敌团管区之残部已于十二月初编入蒋匪四十军）临时编为“西路剿匪总队”保安第一旅一团一、二、三大队四百人，武陟保安团残部一部，修武保安团残部一百人，四十军三一八团搜索连九十人，该军一一五团二营（原敌辉县特务营）二百余人。面临死亡的新乡守敌匪首们异常恐惧我结合军事围困而开展的强大政治攻势。匪四专保安司令兼新乡城防司令张敬忠，在某次军官会议上惊慌的表示，解放军宽大政策“实在可怕”，“要这样下去队伍（指匪军）非垮完不可”。蒋匪虽曾百般镇压及严密封锁管制，但仍然抵挡不住部下的集体逃跑或投我。士兵们已逐渐看透新乡蒋匪不久就要彻底被解放军歼灭的命运，他们已开始认识到，除了投降再无第二条出路。
