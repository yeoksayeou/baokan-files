　　Further Organize Broad Masses of Women to Participate in Production and Construction Movement
  　Northeast Daily Editorial
    [Shenyang, 28th dispatch] The Northeast Daily, in celebration of the opening of the First Northeast Women's Congress, published an editorial entitled "Further Organize Broad Masses of Women to Participate in Production and Construction Movement." The editorial first pointed out the outstanding contributions made by the broad masses of working women in the Northeast under the leadership of the Communist Party over the past three years in supporting the Liberation War and rear production, saying: Batches of women mobilized their sons, husbands, brothers, and younger brothers to the front lines to bravely fight, annihilate the enemy, and earn meritorious service, or travel thousands of miles to serve with the army; and in the rear, they launched a wave of participation in production. For example, in the past year, in northern Manchuria's Nenjiang Province alone, 140,000 women assisted men in farming, and in Heilongjiang Province, 200,000 women participated in summer hoeing, playing a significant role in ensuring that all arable land was planted, expanding the cultivated area, and solving the grain shortage. In cities and factories, women have also made remarkable efforts. In Harbin, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Andong, and other places alone, 40,000 to 50,000 women have organized themselves to sew military uniforms, caps, and shoes for the front lines. Due to their round-the-clock intense labor, they ensured timely supply to the front lines. In many public military supplies factories, textile factories, and other factories, the labor efficiency of female workers has been continuously improving. Female doctors, nurses, teachers, civil servants, and female artists in cities are all able to do their best to serve the war, production, and cultural construction.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] The editorial then pointed out the tasks of the women's movement in the Northeast in the future, saying: Now that the entire Northeast has been liberated and national victory is approaching, the central task of the Northeast Liberated Area in the future is economic construction, thus putting forward the new task of further organizing the broad masses of women to participate in production and construction to the women representatives. In the past, women have achieved many successes in production, but these achievements are not yet very solid. In most areas, women's participation in labor has not reached the proper level of universality and height, the view that labor is glorious has not been universally established, and the organization is still very weak. Especially in southern Manchuria, which is a newly liberated area, the work foundation is particularly weak. Therefore, further organizing and mobilizing women to participate in production, universally establishing the concept of labor, and promoting labor enthusiasm are the main tasks of women's work in the future. It should be understood that large-scale economic construction in the future cannot be successfully completed without a strong and organized women's labor army. In addition to proposing to further organize rural working women in agricultural production, the editorial also proposed that in the future, in cities and industrial areas, special attention should be paid to mobilizing female workers to enter factories and developing female workers' work.
    The editorial then said: In order to adapt to the development of work, in addition to strengthening the Party's leadership and carrying out universal mobilization and organization, it is also necessary to immediately start training a large number of female cadres to become the core and backbone of the women's masses and lead them forward. Training classes and literacy groups for rural working women should be started in a planned way, and they should be boldly promoted in the process of educating and organizing them. Women's welfare undertakings, mainly childcare, should be carried out in cities with emphasis. Education on maternal and child hygiene should be vigorously carried out in rural areas, and the unreasonable marriage system should be changed in a planned way. Finally, the editorial called on all female work cadres to stand firmly at their work posts, continue to work hard, and continue to move forward. Comrades in various work departments, especially economic and cultural departments, should actively help the development of women's work at any time. They must recognize the great significance of women's liberation in our revolutionary cause, and any view that belittles women's work is wrong.

　　进一步组织广大妇女参加生产建设运动
  　东北日报社论
    【沈阳二十八日电】东北日报日前为祝贺东北首届妇女代表大会开幕特以“进一步组织广大妇女参加生产建设运动”为题发表社论。社论首先指出三年来在共产党领导下，东北广大劳动妇女在支援解放战争和后方生产中所作的卓越贡献说：妇女群众一批又一批的动员了自己的儿子、丈夫、哥哥和弟弟，到前线去英勇战斗歼敌立功，或远征千里随军服务；并在后方各地掀起了参加生产的热潮，如去年仅北满的嫩江省即有十四万妇女协助男人种地，黑龙江省有二十万妇女参加夏锄，在保证全部耕地种上、扩大耕地面积及解决粮荒中，起了很大作用。在城市和工厂中，妇女们同样作了惊人的努力，仅哈尔滨、佳木斯、牡丹江、安东等地，就有四五万妇女组织起来，为前线缝制军衣、军帽和军鞋。由于她们日夜的紧张劳动，保证了前线的及时供给。在许多公营军需工厂、纺织工厂及其他工厂中，女工们的劳动效率均在不断地提高，城市中的女医生、女护士、女教师、女公务人员、女艺术工作者，均能克尽己职为战争、为生产、为文化建设服务。
    【新华社沈阳二十八日】社论接着指出今后东北妇女运动的任务说：现在全东北解放，全国胜利即将到来，东北解放区今后的中心任务是经济建设，因而就向妇女代表们提出了进一步组织广大妇女参加生产建设的新任务。过去妇女在生产中已获有不少成绩，但这些成绩还不是十分巩固的。大部地区妇女参加劳动还没有达到应有的普遍与高度，劳动光荣的观点还没有普遍树立，组织性还很薄弱，特别南满是新解放的地区，工作基础尤为薄弱，因而更进一步地组织动员妇女参加生产，普遍的树立劳动观念，发扬劳动热忱，是今后妇女工作的主要任务。应该了解今后大规模的经济建设，没有一支强大的有组织的妇女劳动大军，是不能圆满完成任务的。社论除提出在农业生产中，要把农村劳动妇女进一步组织起来以外，并提出今后在城市，在工业区，动员女工进入工厂及开展女工工作，应予以特别的重视。
    社论接着说：为了适应工作的开展，除了加强党的领导进行普遍的动员与组织外，还必须立即着手培养大批的妇女干部，成为妇女群众的核心与骨干，带领她们前进。要有步骤地开办农村劳动妇女的训练班、识字组，在教育组织她们的过程中，大胆地提拔她们。应该在城市中有重点的举办妇女福利事业，主要的是保育工作。在农村中大力开展妇婴卫生的教育，并有步骤地改变不合理的婚姻制度。最后社论号召全体妇女工作干部，站稳自己的工作岗位，继续努力，不断前进。各个工作部门特别是经济文化部门的同志，应当随时主动地帮助妇女工作的开展，必须认识妇女解放在我们革命事业中的重大意义，任何轻视妇女工作的观点都是错误的。
