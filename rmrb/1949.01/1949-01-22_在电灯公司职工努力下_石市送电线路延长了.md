　　With the Efforts of Electric Company Workers, Shijiazhuang's Transmission Lines Have Been Extended
    [Shijiazhuang News] Since the Shijiazhuang Electric Company put forward the principle of development as the main focus in early September, the work experienced some setbacks due to a period of war preparation. After the victory in war preparation, the company responded to the call of the municipal party committee to increase production and compensate for losses, and became even more active in implementing the aforementioned principle. As of the end of December, despite the extreme shortage of wires, the company managed to extend the city's high-voltage circuits by 4,621 meters and low-voltage lines by 1,856 meters through various means. The number of lighting and power users has also slightly increased. In particular, after a certain substation was repaired in November, the output of electricity increased by about one-third. In addition, with the efforts of all workers, the time of power outages and partial power outages was greatly reduced. By the end of December, the power generation utilization rate was 1.3 times higher than at the end of August. The power generation utilization rate at the end of August (i.e., the percentage of average load to the equipment's power generation capacity) was 19.25%, and at the end of December it was 44.2%. As a result, electricity prices have also been appropriately adjusted. Although the price of electricity for lighting has increased from 1.8 catties of millet per kilowatt-hour to 2 catties, the price of fixed lighting has decreased from 13 catties to 10 catties, and the price of power electricity has decreased from 1.4 catties of millet per kilowatt-hour to 1.2 catties.

　　在电灯公司职工努力下
  　石市送电线路延长了
    【石家庄讯】石家庄市电灯公司自九月初提出了以发展为主的方针后，中间经过一度备战，使工作上受到一些曲折，备战胜利结束后，即响应市委增产补损的号召，对上述方针的执行更加积极，截至十二月底在电线极度缺乏的情况下，东拼西凑，延长了市内高压电路四千六百二十一米，低压线一千八百五十六米，用灯户及动力户均略有增加；特别是某变电所于十一月份修理完毕，增加了输出电量约三分之一，再加上全体工人的努力，大大减少了停电与局部停电的时间，至十二月底的发电利用百分率较八月底提高了一点三倍，八月底之发电利用百分率（即平均负荷与设备发电能力的百分比）为百分之十九点二五，十二月底为百分之四十四点二。这样电价也经过适当调整，虽表灯用电每度由一斤八两小米提到二斤，但包灯已由十三斤减到十斤，动力用电由每度一斤四两小米减到一斤二两。
