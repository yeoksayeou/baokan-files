Taihang Telegram: Since the comprehensive launch of winter production in the Taihang region in November of last year, significant achievements have been made and preliminary experiences have been gained. According to statistics from 224 villages in Yushe, Heshun, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Xiyang, Licheng, Changzhi, Pingshun, Huguan, Lingchuan, Shexian, Shahe, and Zanhuang counties alone, the masses, once organized, profited over 2,000,054,490 yuan (new currency, same below) from transportation; various workshops, small handicrafts, and mountain product gathering earned over 1,300,094,420 yuan; these two categories totaled over 3,363,900 yuan. Twenty-one villages in Changzhi, Licheng, Shahe, and Zanhuang increased their livestock by 49 head through winter production profits. Ten villages in Huguan, Changzhi, and Zuoquan accumulated 154,739 dan of fertilizer. In 143 villages in Shexian, Yushe, and Licheng, women, through mutual aid, spun 10,803 jin of cotton and wove 15,114 jin of cloth. Yuntoudi Village in Zuoquan cut 24,000 jin of brambles, enough to weave 3,000 dan of baskets. The main reasons for these achievements are: First, the issuance of land deeds after the completion of land reform further stabilized the production enthusiasm of all classes, and on this basis, production education was universally and deeply conducted, alleviating certain concerns of the masses. Second, Party branch members and activists took the lead in leadership. Generally, discussions were first held within the branch, cadres were specifically assigned tasks, and they personally took action, integrating heroes and model workers, and rectifying the existing production mutual aid. Different production plans were formulated based on different production conditions, and inspections were conducted at any time to reward model workers. Third, organizing the masses for various productions with the cooperative as the center is the main link in carrying out winter production. After preliminary rectification, most cooperatives shifted towards assisting mass production. Under the assistance of cooperatives, various production conditions were brought into play everywhere, production avenues were widely sought, and slogans such as "rely on the mountains to eat from the mountains, nourish the mountains by eating from the mountains," "do what you are good at," and "labor is money" were put forward. For example, the Langou Cooperative in Licheng organized livestock transportation and earned 6,200 silver dollars; organized women and children to crack 3,000 jin of walnut kernels, earning 3,000 silver dollars; organized the cutting of 8,000 jin of brambles, earning 1,600 silver dollars; and contracted 50,000 jin of brambles, 1,000 adze handles, and 1,500 hammer handles from the Lucheng coal mine, finding production avenues for the masses and achieving the goal of relying on the mountains to eat from the mountains. The Yuntoudi Cooperative in Zuoquan organized 31 head of livestock, earning 8,400 silver dollars in ten days of transportation; organized labor to cut 24,000 jin of brambles, and bought a cotton gin for women's spinning and weaving.

　　合作社帮助群众解除困难
  　太行冬季生产成绩大
    【太行电】太行全区冬季生产自去年十一月全面开展以来，已获得显著成绩并取得初步经验。仅据榆社、和顺、左权、襄垣、昔阳、黎城、长治、平顺、壶关、陵川、涉县、沙河、赞皇等县二百二十四个村的统计，群众组织起来运输共获利二百万零五万四千四百九十余元（新币下同）；各种作坊小手工业、砍山货等共获利一百三十万零九千四百二十余元；二宗共获利三百三十六万三千九百余元。长治、黎城、沙河、赞皇的二十一个村，经过冬季生产获利增加牲口四十九头。壶关、长治、左权的十个村，积肥十五万四千七百三十九担。涉县、榆社、黎城的一百四十三个村妇女互助起来纺花一万零八百零三斤，织布一万五千一百一十四斤。左权云头底村割荆条二万四千斤，可编箩头三千担。获得这些成绩的主要原因是：一、结束土改发了土地证，进一步稳定了各阶层生产情绪，并在这个基础上，普遍深入地进行了生产教育，解除了群众某些顾虑。二、支部党员与积极分子带头领导。各村一般是先在支部讨论，干部具体分工，亲自动手，结合英雄模范，在旧有生产互助基础上进行整顿。根据不同的生产条件，订出不同的生产计划；并随时检查，奖励模范。三、以合作社为中心，组织群众各种生产，是开展冬季生产的主要环节。合作社经过了初步整顿，大部转分向了扶助群众生产。在合作社扶助之下，各地发挥了所有生产条件，广泛地找寻了生产门路，提出了“靠山吃山、吃山养山”，“会干甚就干甚”，“劳动就是钱”等口号。如黎城岚沟合作社，组织牲口运输赚洋六千二百元；组织妇女、儿童敲核桃仁三千斤，赚洋三千元；组织割荆条八千斤，赚洋一千六百元；并到潞城煤窑揽出荆条五万斤，镢把一千根，锤把一千五百根，给群众找下了生产门路，做到了靠山吃山。左权云头底合作社组织了三十一头牲口，运输十天赚洋八千四百元；组织劳力割荆条二万四千斤，买弹花机一架，供给妇女纺织之用。
