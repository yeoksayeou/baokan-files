Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The eight peace conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party have been widely welcomed by the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. A certain Shanghai newspaper that published the full text of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement of the 14th sold 120,000 copies in one day. The general opinion of workers, students, citizens, and middle and lower-ranking public employees regarding this statement is: every one of the eight articles is what the people desire. Patriotic elements within the Kuomintang also share the same view. A civil servant with considerable standing within the Kuomintang said: Some people say that the Kuomintang cannot accept the first article of the eight, namely the punishment of war criminals. I think these guys, even if the Communist Party doesn't kill them, we will kill them. A professor who did not want to be named said: Things in China have become so bad, if the war criminals announced by the CCP are not held responsible, who should be held responsible? An old member of the Tongmenghui said: The net of heaven is vast, and these war criminals will not escape. The people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are actively discussing the preliminary list of war criminals proposed by a certain authoritative figure of the CCP on December 25th last year. Some people said: None of the forty-three people on this list are wronged. More people feel that the list has omitted many important war criminals, such as Zhu Shaoliang, Guo Chan, Li Pinxian, Dong Zhao, Chen Jicheng, and Zhang Zhen in the military field; Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Yu Dawei, Hong Lanyou, Dong XianGuang, and Liu Jianqun in the political field; Deng Wenyi, Huang ShaoGu, Chen Xueping, He Zhonghan, Zhang Daofan, Jiang Jingguo, Zheng Yan＠, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Xiufeng in the party-special affairs field; Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, and Jiang Yuntian in the field of reactionary minor parties. Many students and professors believe that the list must include important war instigators Hu Shi, Yu Bin, and Ye Qing. People in Beiping believe that Xu Huidong and Wu Zhiren should be listed as war criminals. People in Shanghai believe that Pan Gongzhan and Xuan Tiewu should be listed as war criminals. People in Guangdong believe that Zhang Fakui and Luo Zhuoying should be listed as war criminals. People in Sichuan believe that Wang Lingji, Wang Zuanxu, Yang Sen, and Pan Wenhua should be listed as war criminals.

　　国民党统治区人民欢迎毛主席声明
  　纷纷讨论战犯名单
    认为尚有许多重要战犯被遗漏
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中国共产党所提出的八项和平条件，受到了国民党统治区人民的广泛欢迎。登载了中共中央毛泽东主席十四日声明全文的上海某报，一天销售了十二万份。工人，学生，市民和中下级公教人员对于这个声明的普遍意见是：八条不论那一条都是人民大众所要求的。国民党内的爱国分子也有同样看法。一个在国民党内有相当地位的公务人员说：有人说国民党不能接受八条中的第一条，即惩办战争罪犯。我看这些家伙共产党不杀他们的头，我们也要杀他们的头。一个不愿发表姓名的教授说：中国事情弄到如此之糟，如果中共所宣布的战争罪犯不负责任，还应该由谁负责任？一位老同盟会员说：天网恢恢，这些战犯总不会漏网。对于去年十二月二十五日中共某权威人士所提出的战争罪犯的初步名单，国民党统治区的人民正在纷纷议论。有人说：这个名单中的四十三个人一个也不冤。更多的人感觉名单遗漏了许多重要战犯，例如军事方面的朱绍良、郭忏、李品仙、董钊、陈继承、张镇，政治方面的谷正纲、徐堪、俞大维、洪兰友、董显光、刘健群，党特方面的邓文仪、黄少谷、陈雪屏、贺衷寒、张道藩、蒋经国、郑彦＠、郑介民、叶秀峰，反动小党派方面的左舜生、陈启天、蒋匀田。许多学生和教授们认为名单中必须包含重要的战争鼓动者胡适、于斌和叶青，北平人认为许惠东、吴铸人应列为战犯，上海人认为潘公展、宣铁吾应列为战犯，广东人认为张发奎、罗卓英应列为战犯，四川人认为王陵基、王缵绪、杨森、潘文华应列为战犯。
