　　The Workers of Jiaozuo Before and After Liberation
    Hao Dong
    After the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied the Jiaozuo coal mine on October 12, 1946, it was renamed the Zhongfu Company. Under the dark rule of the Kuomintang, the workers lived a life of hunger and suffering. Due to soaring prices and low wages, which were not paid monthly and sometimes delayed for months, the workers often could not get enough to eat and had to pay countless levies. Young workers were often conscripted as cannon fodder. In this miserable situation, the workers tried every means to fight for enough food! They often resisted the enemy by stealing coal, slowing down work, and wasting resources. For example, in the past, the East and West Main Shafts burned 80 tons of small coal daily, and the electromechanical plant burned 40 tons daily, totaling 120 tons. After our liberation, only 105 tons were burned daily, wasting 15 tons every day. Worker XXX said, "In the past, there were many bamboo baskets for holding coal on the walls of the coal plant's machine room. Look, where can you see one now!" Because they couldn't get enough to eat, the workers had to steal coal. Because the workers could not obtain freedom and could not maintain their livelihood, they gradually decreased in number. By the time of liberation, there were only more than 40 people per shift.
    When life became truly unbearable, the workers had to take open action. Another wage increase struggle at the Jiaozuo Electromechanical Plant was launched in June of this year. At that time, more than 40 people participated in the struggle, crowding into the Zhongfu Company's office, selecting their own representatives to negotiate with the company face-to-face. The workers outside the door shouted and cursed Director Liu Xiangshan. The chairman of the trade union, Guo Jingdao, said, "You eat wine and noodles every day, leaving us workers to starve." Some cursed, "Damn your mother, Guo Jingdao, don't you know we have no food to eat?!" More and more workers gathered spontaneously, eventually reaching more than 300 people, finally forcing Guo Jingdao to answer the workers face-to-face, increasing wages by 30 percent.
    In order to control the workers in all aspects, the Kuomintang organized a yellow trade union that sold out the interests of the workers, forcing them to stamp their seals and join. Those who did not participate would have their right to work revoked. The union cadres were not allowed to be democratically elected by the workers, but were appointed by them to be ruling figures who oppressed and deceived the workers. These people exploited the workers' blood and sweat. After the establishment of the union, it was stipulated that each person should pay a membership fee of 10,000 Chiang coins per month. The workers also had their salaries reduced once. As the old foundry worker Deng Changfu said, "The past society was too dark. Sons raised were for Chiang Kai-shek, daughters born were for the officials, grain earned was for the village chiefs, and the wages earned by the workers were taken away by the 'union.' There was no place for us to live."
    During the two years of the Liberation War, with the development of the guerrilla war outside Jiaozuo city, the workers in the Jiaozuo mining area also launched continuous struggles in the city. Until October 23rd of last year, the Jiaozuo mining area was liberated again. From then on, the workers began to see the light of day again. On this day, the workers stood up as masters. They protected all the machines completely undamaged. Worker Yuan Tingxu was originally supposed to leave work at four o'clock at night, but in order to protect the machines, he waited until dawn. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city, the workers automatically gathered, holding various small flags with the words "Long Live the People's Liberation Army, Long Live the Communist Party" written on them, and went to the South Gate and Northwest Gate to welcome the People's Liberation Army into the city. The sunlight was even brighter, waiting for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. The Wang and Li Feng power plants did not stop working and continued to operate. On the evening of the 24th, the streets and alleys of the city were normally supplied with electricity, quickly restoring order in the city.
    After the Jiaozuo Coal Mine was officially taken over by the Enterprise Department of our North China Government, the workers automatically organized their own trade union groups and actively participated in the restoration work. After more than a month of sorting out the factory, all the work was generally in order. The number of workers gradually increased, and the production volume increased day by day. In the past, the two main shafts of Wang and Li Feng had more than 900 people, and the Jiaozuo Electromechanical Plant had 200 people, totaling more than 1,000 people. Now, the East and West Main Shafts have increased to more than 1,200 people, and the electromechanical plant has increased to 209 people, totaling more than 1,400 people. Before liberation, 150 workers in the East and West Main Shafts produced 80 tons of coal per day. In the half-month after liberation, 595 people in the East and West Main Shafts produced 502 tons of coal per day. The daily output per person increased from 70 percent to 90 percent. Expenditures have also been greatly reduced: in the past, 120 tons of coal were burned every day, but now only 105 tons are burned, saving 15 tons every day.
    The rapid increase in production is mainly due to the democratic government actively protecting the interests of the workers. For example, on the issue of wages, the lowest wage for workers under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek bandits was 0.33 fake gold yuan, and the highest was 1.35 yuan, with each yuan equivalent to 3 million fake Central Bank notes. At that time, each斗 of grain cost 8 million yuan. In reality, a day's wages could not buy even half a斗 of grain. Coupled with the failure to pay on time and the deductions along the way, the workers suffered even more. They couldn't even fill their stomachs, so how could they have the heart to produce? After liberation, each worker first borrowed 45斤 of corn and 5,000 yuan in silver dollars. A temporary wage system was also stipulated: those with a base salary below one yuan when the enemy was here would receive an increase of 100 percent, those with 1.35 yuan would receive an increase of 95 percent, and those with 1.5 yuan would receive an increase of 75 percent. Each fake gold yuan was equivalent to one ＠, with the highest wage being 72 ＠ and the lowest being 18 ＠. Each person received 300斤 of coal per month, ensuring the livelihood of the workers. Therefore, less than two months after liberation, production had a significant increase. The workers said, "When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were here, we were almost starved to death. Who would work well for him! Now we are producing for our own liberation. We must work harder, support the front, and quickly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and liberate all the Chinese people."

　　解放前后的焦作工人
    浩东
    集作煤矿在蒋匪于一九四六年十月十二日侵占后，改名为中福公司。在国民党黑暗统治下，工人们过着饥饿痛苦的生活。因物价暴涨，工资过低，且不能按月得到手，有时几个月领不下来，工人们经常吃不饱肚子，还得出无数的捐项，青年工友们常常被抓走当炮灰。在这种苦境下，工人们想尽了办法，为吃饱肚子而斗争！他们经常用偷煤、怠工、浪费等方式向敌人反抗，如过去东西大井每天烧小炭八十吨，机电厂每天烧四十吨，共计一百二十吨，我解放后，每天只烧一百零五吨。当时每天就浪费了十五吨。工人×××说：“过去煤厂机器房墙上挂的好多盛煤的竹篮，你看现在哪还见一个哩！”因为吃不饱肚子，工人们只好偷煤。由于工人们得不到自由，维持不了生活，因此逐渐减少。到解放时每班只有四十多人。
    在生活实在无法维持的时候，工人们不得不采取公开斗争的方式。焦作机电厂又一次要求增资斗争是在今年六月发起的。当时参加斗争的有四十多人，拥挤到中福公司的办公处，选出自己的代表向公司当面交涉，门外的工人们就高呼大骂处长刘香山，工会长郭景道说：“你们每天吃酒吃面，让我们工人饿肚。”有的骂：“日你妈的郭景道，你就不知道我们没有吃饭！？”工人们不约而同地越来越多，最后增至三百多人，终于胜利地迫使郭景道向工人们当面答复增加工资百分之三十。
    为了从各方面来统治工人，国民党曾组织出卖工人利益的黄色工会，强迫工人盖章加入，如不参加即取消工人上工权利。工会的干部不许工人民主选举，由他们指定压迫欺骗工人的统治人物担任。这些人从中搜刮工人的血汗。工会成立后，规定每月每人收会费蒋币一万元。又给工人们减了一次薪。如翻砂工人邓长富老汉说：“过去的社会太黑暗了，养下儿子是老蒋的，生下的闺女是官长的，赚下的粮食是保长的，工人劳动下的工资“工会”拿去，没有咱活的天地。”
    两年的解放战争，随着焦作市外游击战争的开展，焦作矿区的工友们，在市内亦掀起了不断的斗争。直到去年十月二十三号，焦作矿区重获解放，至此工人们开始重见天日，这天工人们以主人的姿态站起来了。他们将所有的机器保护得完整无损。工人袁廷旭本来夜间四点钟就该下工，但为了保护机器一直等到天明。当解放军入城时，工人们自动集合，举着各色小旗，上写：“解放军万岁，共产党万岁。”到南门口、西北口迎接解放军入城。阳光更加倍的明亮，等着解放军到来。王、李封电厂即没停工，一直工作着。二十四日晚市内大街小巷照常供电放光，使市内的秩序迅速恢复。
    焦作煤矿自我华北政府企业部正式接收后，工人们自动组织自己的工会小组，积极参加恢复工作。工厂经过一个多月的整理，一切工作大致就绪。工人逐渐增加，生产量日渐提高。过去王、李封两大井共九百多人，焦作机电厂二百人，共一千多人，现在东西大井增加到一千二百多人，机电厂增到二百零九人，共一千四百多人。解放前东西大井一百五十个工人每日出煤八十吨，解放后半个多月内，东西大井五百九十五人，日出煤五百零二吨。每天每人由七成一增加到九成一。开支上亦已大大节省：过去每天烧煤一百二十吨，现在只烧一百零五吨，每日节省十五吨。
    生产量的迅速提高，主要由于民主政府积极保护工人的利益，如在工资问题上，过去蒋匪统治时工人最低工资是伪金圆券三毛三，最高的一元三毛五，每元折合伪中央票三百万元。而当时每斗粮食得八百万元，实际上一天的工资买不到半斗粮食。加上不能按期发给及半路的克扣，工人更加吃亏，连肚子都吃不饱，哪还有心生产？解放后，工人每人先预借玉茭四十五斤，大洋五千元。并规定了暂时的工资制度：按敌在时工资底薪一元以下者加百分之百，一元三毛五者加百分之九十五，一元五者加百分之七十五，每元伪金圆券折合一个＠，最高工资七十二个＠，最低十八个＠，每人每月发煤三百斤，工人生活都得到保证。所以解放还不到两个月，生产就有了显著的提高。工人们说：“蒋匪在这里的时候，快都把我们饿死了，谁还给他好好的干！现在是为咱自己解放而生产，咱们要加劲干，努力支前，快些把蒋介石打倒，解放全中国人民。”
