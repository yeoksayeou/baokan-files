Working Research

　　According to a survey conducted by the Gaoping County Government Office in January of last year, the county had 9,015 head of livestock. Now, the number has increased to 11,286, representing a total increase of 2,271 head of livestock in one year. The main reasons for the increase are: first, the consolidation of war support work, making labor assignments more fair and reasonable; second, the correction of policies, which boosted the production enthusiasm of the people. For example, Kangying Village in the Third District had 23 head of livestock in July of the year before last. After rectification of the corvée labor system, the number increased to 36 by the end of the year, and now it has further increased to 64. In Tang'an Village, there were 121 head of livestock in January of last year, and now there are 172. Some people have also replaced their poor-quality livestock with better ones. Ma Buhai, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, had long wanted to replace his donkey with a mule, but he was afraid that others would say he was a middle peasant and didn't dare to do so. In February, he attended a production meeting at the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, clarified the methods for class determination and the policy of uniting with the middle peasants. Only then did he replace his donkey with a mule. Subsequently, Zhang Youde, Li Shuihan, and others who were mistakenly struggled against as middle peasants also replaced their poor-quality livestock with better ones. Based on our investigation and research, to significantly increase livestock in the future, we must pay attention to resolving the following issues:

    I. Reducing Livestock Mortality:

    From January to October of last year, 320 head of livestock died in the entire county, accounting for 14.5% of the increased number. Out of the 184 administrative villages in the county, livestock deaths occurred in 121 villages, except for 63. For example, in Mayou Village in the Third District, there were originally 90 head of livestock. Last year, the number increased by 44, but 10 died, accounting for 23% of the increased livestock. In Liujiashan Village in the Fifth District, there were originally 40 head of livestock. Last year, the number increased by 20, but 9 died, accounting for 41% of the increased livestock. Why did so many livestock die? There are several reasons: (1) Insufficient care during labor service. For example, when transporting grain to Yicheng in January of last year, 52 cattle, 4 donkeys, 4 mules, and 2 horses died. This was mainly due to the equal burden sharing regardless of the quality of the livestock. Regardless of whether they were cattle, donkeys, mules, or horses, and regardless of their physical strength, they were all assigned the same burden. In addition, there were too many vehicles on the road, and the inns and reception stations were small with insufficient fodder, so the livestock could not rest adequately and were worn out to death. Although the government compensated with millet at 70% of the then-current livestock price, the number of livestock decreased, resulting in losses. (2) Problems with feeding and usage. According to veterinarian Guan Mingyue, livestock diseases are mainly caused by improper feeding and usage. If water and grass are not balanced, it can cause internal heat; walking too fast after eating and drinking can cause stomach pain. Last year, 193 head of livestock died from disease, while only 16 died from overwork, 27 died from falls, and 13 died as foals. For example, in Liujiabeishan Village, 7 out of the 9 livestock that died were due to illness. Therefore, regarding livestock labor service, attention should be paid to the quality, size, and strength of the livestock, and the burden should be assigned according to the distance. Special attention should be paid to feeding and usage. Allow livestock to rest when they need to, pay attention to livestock hygiene, and prevent the occurrence of diseases.

    II. Continuing to Increase Livestock:

    The entire county is short 603 head of livestock, but not every village is short. Therefore, loans must be planned to help villages that are short of livestock to buy livestock. The bank has already loaned funds for 325 head of livestock, totaling 586,500 yuan (new currency). However, villages such as Dayechuan and Yuancun in the Third District are short of livestock, but no one has applied for loans. Why is this? (1) These villages are not conveniently located for transportation and are afraid that the two-month repayment period for the loan is too short to repay on time. Unlike some villages such as Chencun, which are close to the iron furnace and can earn one dou of millet per day by hauling ore, carrying charcoal, and hauling coal, making their finances very fluid. These villages originally did not lack livestock, but they have recently borrowed money to buy back ten head of livestock. (2) Some people want to raise livestock and engage in transportation during the off-season, but they lack livestock equipment and are afraid that they cannot afford to buy equipment after buying livestock. Therefore, to solve the livestock problem in villages short of livestock through loans, the above two difficulties must be taken into consideration, the loan repayment period should be appropriately extended, and assistance should be provided to the masses to solve the problem of purchasing livestock equipment.

    Another issue regarding continuing to increase livestock is promoting breeding. Due to erroneous views left over from the old society, people look down on those engaged in breeding. Of the 34 breeding male livestock in Gaoping, only 11 are still being used for breeding. In the future, the government must promote breeding to increase livestock, publicize that breeding is beneficial to the production of the masses, change the erroneous views of these masses, and encourage those engaged in breeding to carry out this legitimate and beneficial work well, in order to breed and increase the livestock of the liberated areas.

### 高平增加牲口的几个问题

　　高平增加牲口的几个问题
    高平县政府办公室去年一月调查：高平全县有九千零十五头牲口，现在增加到一万一千二百八十六头，一年里一共增加了二千二百七十一头牲口。增加的主要原因：一个是整顿了战勤工作，在出勤上比较公平合理；一个是端正政策使大家的生产情绪提高了。象三区康营村，前年七月有二十三头牲口，经过整差以后，到年底就增加到三十六头，到现在又增加到了六十四头。象唐安村去年一月有一百二十一头牲口，现在增加到一百七十二头。还有些人把坏牲口换成了好牲口。农会主席马补孩早就想把自己的毛驴换成个骡子，害怕别人说他是中农不敢换；二月里他到专署参加了生产会议，闹清楚了划阶级的办法和团结中农的政策，回来才把驴换了个骡子。接着误斗中农张有德、李水旱等，也都把自己的坏牲口换成了好牲口。根据我们的调查研究，今后要大量的增加牲口，还得注意解决下面几个问题：
    一、减少牲口死亡的问题：
    从去年一月到十月，全县就死了三百二十头牲口，死的占增加的百分之十四点五。全县一百八十四个行政村，除了六十三个行政村以外，剩下的一百二十一个行政村都死了牲口。象三区马游村，原来有九十头牲口，去年增加了四十四头，就死了十头，占增加牲口数的百分之二十三。五区刘家山村，原来有四十头牲口，去年增加了二十头就死了九头，占增加牲口数的百分之四十一。为什么牲口死得这样多呢？有这么几个原因：（一）服勤时照顾不够，如去年一月往翼城运粮，就死了牛五十二头、驴四头、骡子四头、马两头，主要是因为不分牲口好、坏平均负担所造成的；如不分是牛、驴、骡、马，也不管体力强弱，一律平均负担，再加路上车辆太多，店房和招待站地方又小，草料也不足，牲口休息不过来，就熬磨死了。虽然政府按当时牲口价钱的七成赔了小米，可是总是牲口减少了，受了损失。（二）喂养使用上有毛病：根据兽医关明月说：牲口得病主要是喂养、使用上不得法。如果水草不匀就会上心火；吃喝完走得太快，就要肚子痛。去年一年里病死的牲口就有一百九十三头，而劳动过重死了的只十六头，跌死的二十七头，因为生驹死的十三头；象刘家北山村死了九头就有七头是病死的。这样关于牲口服勤上，就应该注意照顾牲口的好、坏、大、小，分配出负担的轻重远近，在喂养使用上，要特别注意，该歇时候就让牲口歇歇；注意牲口卫生，防止疾病发生。
    二、继续增加牲口的问题：
    全县共缺牲口六百零三头，但也不是每村都缺，因此贷款得有计划地帮助缺牲口村买牲口。现在银行已贷出三百二十五头牲口的贷款，计洋五十八万六千五百元（新币）。可是三区大野川和原村等村缺牲口，却都没有人来贷款，这是为什么呢？（一）这些村搞运输不便利，怕贷上款两个月时间太短到期还不了；不象陈村等一些村子，离的铁炉近，拉矿、担炭、拉煤每天可赚一斗小米，手头上很活动。该村牲口本来不缺，可是最近又贷款买回十头牲口。（二）有的想喂牲口，农闲搞搞运输，就是缺少牲口家具；怕买上牲口又置不起家具。这样要贷款解决缺牲口村的牲口问题，就得照顾到以上两点困难，把贷款归还的限期适当延长一下，同时帮助群众解决置买牲口家具的困难。
    继续增加牲畜的再一个问题，便是提倡配种；因为旧社会遗留下来的错误看法，对干配种这一行的人看不起。高平三十四头配种的公牲口，只有十一头牲口还进行配种。今后政府提倡配种增加牲畜，就得宣传配种是与群众生产有利的事情，转变这些群众的错误看法，鼓励干配种的好好进行这一正当有利的工作，以繁殖增加解放区的牲口。
