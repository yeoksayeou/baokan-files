Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 26th: After eight months of vigorous recovery and reconstruction, Yan'an City is now presenting a new look. Before the liberation of Yan'an, the thirty-four villages surrounding the city were devastated into "no-man's-lands" by the Kuomintang bandit troops, with 5,737 cave dwellings destroyed and the vast majority of 33,000 mu of arable land left barren. Of the original three hundred-plus handicraft workshops, only forty-odd remained after enemy destruction. After liberation, with the democratic government's coordination and the people's reconstruction efforts, great achievements have been made in the past eight months. According to statistics, all thirty-three villages in the city have now been fully restored, and four thousand empty cave dwellings have also been repaired. The cultivated area has been restored to more than 20,000 mu, accounting for more than 65% of the total area of 33,000 mu of arable land before the enemy's occupation. The municipal government plans to continue restoring this to 75% to 80% during this year's spring plowing. Before the enemy occupation, only 2,400 mu of winter wheat were planted in the city. Last year, this had increased to more than 5,100 mu. There has also been an increase in draught animals, with farmers in Dongjiao Township in the eastern district purchasing fourteen head of cattle. In terms of industry and commerce, more than two hundred handicraft workshops and larger factories have been restored. The Huafeng Chemical Tannery, a privately-owned factory, which was assisted with loans from the democratic government, is now producing military supplies such as leather bags, belts, gun holsters, and leather jackets for the front lines. Under the leadership of the government, banks, and trade organizations, more than 90% of the private shops in the city have abandoned the promotion of luxury goods and turned to promoting local products and supplying necessities for rural areas, transforming the commodity market in Yan'an City from a primarily luxury goods market to a primarily essential goods market. Market prices are becoming increasingly stable. Cooperative enterprises are being restored according to the needs of the people, including the Dazhong, Yiyao, and Peizhuang cooperatives. In terms of culture and education, the first and second complete primary schools have been restored to their original state, with more than 350 students. Since the beginning of winter, various townships have also established fifteen or sixteen winter schools, literacy groups, and night schools. There are currently five blackboard newspapers in the city, regularly reflecting current events, the policies of the Chinese Communist Party, the decrees of the democratic government, and the lives and production of the people of Yan'an, as well as deeds of supporting the front lines. Party rectification work is currently underway in various districts of the city, and democratic movements have been launched in various townships. Advanced elements among the peasants and other working people are being successively admitted into the Party.

　　经八个月恢复重建
  　延安市呈现新气象
    【新华社延安二十六日电】延安市经八个月来大力恢复重建，现已呈现新气象。延安光复前，市周围三十四个村庄被国民党匪军摧残为“无人区”，有五千七百三十七孔窑洞被破坏，三万三千亩耕地绝大部分荒芜。原有三百余家手工业作坊被敌摧残得只剩下四十余家。光复后经民主政府协同人民重建，八个月来已获得很大成绩。据统计，现在全市已有三十三个村庄全部恢复，有四千空窑洞亦已修复，耕地面积已恢复了二万余亩，占敌人占领以前的三万三千亩耕地总面积的百分之六十五以上。市政府拟于今年春耕期间继续恢复到百分之七十五到百分之八十以上。敌人占领以前全市冬麦只种二千四百亩，去年已增种至五千一百余亩。耕畜亦有增加，东区东郊乡农民即已添买耕牛十四头。工商业方面，手工业作坊和较大工厂，已恢复到二百余家。民主政府贷款扶助其恢复的民党华丰化学制革厂，现已出产皮包、皮带、枪套、皮袄等军用品供应前线。在政府、银行和贸易机关领导之下，全市百分之九十以上的私人商铺，已放弃奢侈品之推销，转向于推销土产，供给农村必需品，使延安市商品市场，由基本奢侈品市场转变为基本必须品市场。市场物价日益稳定。合作事业根据人民的需要进行恢复，已恢复者有大众、医药、裴庄等合作社。文教方面，已将第一、第二完全小学恢复原状，学生已达三百五十余名。入冬以来，各乡并举办了冬学、识字组、夜学等十五、六处。全市现有五处黑板报，经常反映时事消息、中国共产党的政策、民主政府法令和延安市人民生活及生产和支援前线的事迹现全市各区正进行整党工作，各乡展开了民主运动，农民及其他劳动人民中的先进分子正陆续被吸收入党。
