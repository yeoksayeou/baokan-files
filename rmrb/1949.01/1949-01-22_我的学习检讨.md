My Self-Criticism on Learning
    Li Keqin
    I am a district cadre. In the past, I had a biased understanding of learning. I thought that I was very busy working in the district office every day, and even more busy working in the villages, so where would I have time to learn? I even regarded learning as a troublesome burden. Even when I wanted to learn sometimes, I would only look at the big victory news in the newspapers; when I didn't want to learn, I wouldn't even look at the newspapers. Especially for the lengthy editorials, commentaries, and important documents and instructions published in the newspapers, I thought there were too many to read at once, so I didn't read them at all. In my mind, I always thought: doing a good job is more important than anything else, it doesn't matter much whether I learn or not!
    After this self-examination, I realized that this erroneous thinking of mine is basically due to my laziness in learning. To say that in the countryside, in the district, no matter how busy I am, I can always find time to learn. Precisely because I am lazy, I don't seize the time to learn. If I truly want to do a good job with full enthusiasm, I can only improve my theoretical and cultural level through learning, so that I can be good at grasping policies, analyzing problems, studying work, and doing a better job without making mistakes. This time, I have made up my mind to respond to the call for learning and improve my theory and culture a step further.
    Regarding the question of how general district cadres should learn, I would like to offer some suggestions for comrades to consider.
    At present, the general situation of district cadres is that most of them are workers and peasants promoted from the countryside, their cultural and theoretical level is very low, and most of them are often scattered in villages to work, with little concentrated time. Therefore, in the future: (1) The learning leadership in each district must still establish a learning committee. Comrades working in the district should be divided into groups, stipulate the content of learning, and adhere to a daily two-hour learning system. (2) Some district cadres work alone in the village. Self-study should be emphasized. Those with low education levels can ask local primary school teachers for help, and regularly recognize characters, write characters, and write diaries every day. (3) Those who can write letters can also be encouraged to communicate with each other, exchange experiences, and encourage each other. Writing letters is also a way of learning. (4) In order to improve the enthusiasm of cadres, the learning committee should also conduct regular inspections and tests, and carry out commendations and criticisms.

　　我的学习检讨
    李克勤
    我是一个区干部，过去对学习认识是有偏差的，自己认为每天在区公所工作很忙碌，下乡到村，工作更是繁杂，哪有时间去进行学习呢？把学习竟当做了麻烦的负担。纵然有时想学习，也只看看报纸上的大胜利消息；不想学习，就连报也不看了。尤其对报纸登载的长篇社论、专论及重要文件、指示，认为多，一下看不完，更不看。思想上总以为：搞好工作比什么都强，学习不学习，没有多大关系！
    这次自己作了一下检讨，我这种错误的思想，基本是由于自己对学习懒惰，要说在乡村，在区上，不管怎样忙，总能有时间学习的。正因为自己懒，所以也不抓紧时间学习。如果真正愿意抱着满腔热情把工作搞好，只有经过学习，提高自己的理论与文化水平，才能善于掌握政策，分析问题，研究工作，把工作做的更好，不致犯错误。这次我已下决心响应学习的号召，把自己理论、文化提高一步。
    关于一般区干部应如何学习的问题，这里我提出一点意见，以供同志们参考。
    现在区干部一般情况，大部分都是从农村里提拔出来的工农分子，他们的文化、理论水平很低，而且大部经常分散在村工作，集中的时间少，所以今后：（一）各区的学习领导，仍须要建立学习委员会，在区工作的同志应分成小组，规定出学习的内容，坚持每日两小时学习制。（二）有些区干部只有一个人独自在村工作，应强调其自学为主，文化程度低的，可请当地小学教员帮助，每天按时认字、写字、作日记。（三）能写信的，还可发动互相通信，交流经验，互相勉励，写信也是个学习的办法。（四）学委会为了提高干部的情绪，还要有定期的检查、测验，进行表扬批评。
