Title: Reading "The Righteous Forces Exorcise Evil"

Having read Zhao Shuli's "The Righteous Forces Exorcise Evil," my overall impression is that, through criticism and self-criticism from both within and outside the Party, all the defects existing in the liberated areas will eventually be thoroughly examined and completely overcome through Party and mass organizational rectification. As the title of the article suggests, evil cannot suppress righteousness, and correct policies, correct opinions, and correct people will ultimately triumph. If anyone still shakes their head and sighs in the face of existing defects, expressing disappointment with the liberated areas (as some once did), they will ultimately be proven wrong.

Another impression is that this article presents a serious task to the rural Party and all mass revolutionary organizations: to study and publicize the Party's general line, general policy, and various specific policies, and to rectify these organizations, cleanse them of opportunists and class dissidents (although their number is not large), and transform their work style. It will awaken the broad masses of Party members and the people to consciously carry out various necessary tasks and complete this mission, because this is of great importance to their own liberation cause.

If "The Righteous Forces Exorcise Evil" has any shortcomings, I think it is mainly that the events after liberation are written too simply, so that the changes in some events and characters seem conceptual; for example, the main figures in the branch and the problems that occur with them, Xiao Dan's sudden transformation into an activist without being squeezed into a major leadership position, and Ruan Ying's sudden complete belief that unreasonable marriage contracts can be解除 in the future without seeing a precedent for marital autonomy. However, it should be stated that this only means that it is written simply and hastily, not that these facts do not exist in the rural areas of the liberated areas. On the contrary, these things exist in large numbers and are well known. If the author were not in a hurry to end his story, he could have written it as vividly and specifically as the previous section, which could have given cadres and the masses more education.

Some people think that the author should not have opened fire on Xiao Dan, a landlord's pawn, because he is not a revolutionary target; my opinion is the opposite: in the North China Liberated Area, the feudal landlord class has been basically eliminated. The urgent demands of the masses, in addition to determining land rights and production, are for democracy. Specifically, it is to demand that the cadres who directly lead them in various activities be chosen by themselves; they are most opposed to opportunists like Xiao Dan who take advantage of loopholes, infringe upon the interests of the people, and commit evil deeds. From the Party's standpoint, such elements are also a serious obstacle to our leadership of the masses in supporting the front lines and construction; if this obstacle is not removed, the work cannot move forward, and the Party cannot unite the masses around itself. Of course, if the author could describe in detail the history of the people's struggle against the feudal landlords, it would be helpful to the work of summarizing the experience of land reform to educate the people. I hope the author will produce such works in the future. I would also agree if a paragraph were added to "The Righteous Forces Exorcise Evil." However, it is not impossible for the author to describe Xiao Dan more in order to serve the present more directly. If this is said to be a weak class viewpoint, there is no evidence. Even if the author did not say it directly, didn't Xiao Dan rely on the power of the landlord to do evil in the past? Wasn't he entrusted by the landlord to serve the landlord, thus causing pain to the people? This is very clear in the article, and it is also fully understood by the peasants in the liberated areas.

　　读了“邪不压正”
    而东
    赵树理同志的“邪不压正”给我的总印象，一个是经过党内外群众的批评与自我批评，一切存在于解放区的缺陷最后将被彻底检查出来，并经过党与群众组织的整顿而得到彻底克服。正如该文标题所说，邪不能压正，正确的政策、正确的意见与人物终将战胜。如果还有人面对现存的缺陷而摇头叹息，表示对解放区失望（这是曾经有过的），最后都将证明是错误的。
    另一个印象，是这篇文章向农村党与一切群众的革命组织提出了学习与宣传党的总路线、总政策与各个具体政策的严重任务，提出了整顿这些组织、清洗投机分子、阶级异己分子（虽然他们的数目并不大）与改造作风的严重任务。它将唤起广大党员与群众，自觉地去进行各种必要的工作，完成这任务。因为这对他们自己的解放事业是关系重大的。
    如果说“邪不压正”有缺点的话，我认为主要是解放以后的事情写得太简单了些，以至有些事件与人物的变化显得概念化；如支部几个主要人物和他们发生的问题，小旦摇身一变而为积极分子而又没挤到主要领导职位上去，软英并未看到婚姻自主的先例，突然就完全相信了不合理的婚约将来能解除等。不过应该说明，这只是说写得简单与草率，并不是说解放区农村不存在这些事实。相反，这是大量的存在，并为人所熟知的。如果作者不急于结束他的故事，是可以象前段一样写得生动具体的，可以给干部与群众更多教育的。
    有人认为作者不应该针对小旦这样一个地主的腿来开火，因为他不是革命对象；我的意见相反：在华北解放区，封建地主阶级是基本上消灭了的。群众的迫切要求，除了确定地权与生产，就是民主。具体说，就是要求直接领导他们进行各种活动的干部，要由他们自己来选择；他们最反对的就是象小旦这类投机取巧、侵害人民利益，为非作恶分子。从党的立场看，这类分子也正是我们领导群众进行支援前线与生产建设的严重障碍；不扫除这障碍，工作就不能前进，党就不能把群众团结在自己周围。当然作者如果能够详尽地描写人民对封建地主斗争的历史，这对于总结土地改革的经验以教育人民的工作是有好处的，我希望作者在将来产生这样的作品。如果在“邪不压正”里写上一段，我也同意。但作者为了更直接地服务于当前，较多地描写了小旦，也并非不可以。如果说这就是阶级观点不强，是没有证据的。即使作者没有直说，小旦以前为非作恶还不是仗着地主的势力？还不是受地主委托、为地主服务，因而给人民以痛苦？这一点，文里看得很明显，也是解放区农民完全了解的。
