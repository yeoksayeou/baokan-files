Inquiry and Answer

　　Revolutionary Staff Members are Differentiated by Political Treatment

　　Question: The People's Daily Inquiry and Answer on October 7th, the first item answering Zhao Xizheng's question: "...Management personnel of state-owned enterprises, if on a supply system, should enjoy the same treatment as revolutionary staff members. Exempt from service..." This answer raised some questions for me: Who are considered revolutionary staff members? Is it based on the nature of the work, or the living standard (supply system or salary system)? If the original Party, government, and military cadres on the supply system are assigned by the organization to work as staff members in state-owned factories (with a salary), are they still considered revolutionary staff members? I hope the relevant authorities can provide a clear answer.

　　Answer: The Inquiry and Answer on October 7th, "Regarding management personnel of state-owned enterprises, if on a supply system, should enjoy the same treatment as revolutionary staff members, exempt from service," this is differentiating between salary system and supply system living standards. Because during the People's Liberation War, everyone had the obligation to pay taxes and perform service to the country, but currently, government, people's, economic, medical, and cultural comrades on the supply system receive only enough to maintain their personal lives. Besides meeting the minimum living requirements, they really cannot afford to pay taxes, and their workload is also very heavy, so they don't have time for service. Therefore, they are exempt from service and taxes. As for staff members on the salary system, although their salaries are still very low, they are much higher than those on the supply system, so it is appropriate for them to pay some taxes and perform service. As for the title of revolutionary staff member, all staff members in the current liberated areas, except for government-appointed government and enterprise staff, those not appointed by the government must also obey certain organizational assignments, and therefore they should also be members of the revolutionary staff.

　　革命职员是按政治待遇区别
    问：十月七日人民日报询问与解答第一条答赵晰争问：“……国营企业的管理人员如系供给制，应享受革命职员同等待遇。免服勤务……。”由此解答使我发生了一些疑问：革命职员指那些人员？系按工作性质，抑按生活待遇（供给制还是薪金制）分别？如原来是供给制的党政军干部，被组织派到国营工厂去担任职员（待遇是薪金）是否仍算革命职员？希有关方面予以明白答复。

    答：十月七日询问与解答“关于国营企业的管理人员，如系供给制，应享受革命职员同等待遇，免服勤务”，这是区别薪金制与供给制生活待遇而言，因为在人民解放战争时期，人人有对国家缴纳赋税和服勤的义务，但由于目前供给制的政民及经济医务以及文化工作同志，他们享受的待遇，只是维持个人生活，除过最低生活的要求外，实在无力再拿出财力缴纳赋税，同时他们工作很重，也无时间支出勤务，所以免勤免税，至薪金制的工作人员，虽然他们薪水仍很低，但比供给制还是高得多，出些赋税和勤务是应该的，至于革命职员的称号，就目前解放区所有工作人员，除政府委任者之政府及企业工作人员外，其不受政府委任之人员，也要服从一定的组织分配，因之他们也应是革命职员之一员。
