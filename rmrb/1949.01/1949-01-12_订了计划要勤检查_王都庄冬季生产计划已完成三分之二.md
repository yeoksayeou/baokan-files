Taihang News: Lucheng's Wangduzhuang Village has inspected its winter production achievements and has completed two-thirds of its planned goals. After the autumn harvest, the village set a two-month production plan of one hundred and fifty shi of rice. Specific production requirements were as follows: Each male full laborer was to produce eight dou of rice, with eighty-seven men producing a total of sixty-nine shi and six dou. Each female full laborer was to produce two dou of rice, with one hundred and seventy-six women producing a total of twenty-five shi and two dou. Forty-six livestock and thirty-two large carts were to produce a total of sixty-nine shi of rice. In total, the entire plan was to produce one hundred and seventy-three shi and eight dou of rice. According to a mid-month inspection and summary of production achievements, each male full laborer had completed an average of six dou of rice; some had even exceeded the plan. For example, Wang Qize earned three shi and two dou of rice in twenty-eight days making adobe bricks in Houhe; Liu Wenfang and his three sons earned eleven shi and five dou of rice making shell boxes, adobe bricks, and doing carpentry work; Xu Gengxin, Wang Taizhi, and others each produced four shi or two shi or more. Livestock and carts earned a total of fifty-seven shi and six dou of rice through transportation. Women have mostly completed one dou of rice each, with some also exceeding the plan. The main winter production methods include transportation, weaving straw hat braids, making adobe bricks, gathering firewood, accumulating ash, and collecting manure. In total, over one hundred shi of rice have been produced, completing about two-thirds of the plan. The main reasons for this production achievement are two: (1) The village did a good job compensating wrongly-struggled middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants (those struggled against now have land and housing, resolving their living difficulties) during the land reform. This removed production obstacles, and the masses had a production enthusiasm to "become rich." In addition, the gap between cadres and the masses has been eliminated, and they can unite and actively engage in production together. (2) Cadres can actively take the lead. The Farmers' Association director insists on various tasks in the village, allowing all cadres to participate in and lead production. He also promotes everyone's production when he has time, and he does not give up his own manure collection and fertilizer accumulation. Other cadres, such as Wang Dongfang, lead the masses in transportation work from early morning to late at night, earning money himself and upgrading his small cart to a large cart and his donkey to a mule. In terms of production organization, the entire village has five teams. In addition to the original two teams and four mutual aid groups that have already organized more than twenty people, others voluntarily and flexibly form small groups of three to five people within the team's scope, with each team's cadres responsible for supervision and inspection. Because the cadres participate in organization and leadership, and the mutual aid groups are voluntarily formed, everyone is very enthusiastic about production. For example, Wang Ruqi, Liu Wenfang, and others have rice left over after paying public grain. In addition, the combination of production and frugality is also a major reason for profit, such as Wang Dongfang bringing grass and fodder for livestock and dry food for people when transporting, reducing travel expenses.

### 订了计划要勤检查　王都庄冬季生产计划已完成三分之二

　　订了计划要勤检查
  　王都庄冬季生产计划已完成三分之二
    【太行讯】潞城王都庄村检查冬季生产成果，已完成计划三分之二。该村在秋收后订了个一百五十石米的两月生产计划，具体生产要求为：男全劳力每人生产八斗米，八十七人应产米六十九石六斗。女全劳力每人二斗米，一百七十六人应产米二十五石二斗。四十六个牲畜和三十二辆大车共产米六十九石。全计整个计划应生产米一百七十三石八斗。据上月中旬检查总结生产成果，平均每个男全劳力已完成六斗米；有的并已超过计划：如王奇则在后河打土坯，二十八天赚米三石二斗，刘文芳父子三人做炮弹箱、打土坯、做木工零活等赚米十一石五斗，许庚辛、王太只等都生产了四石或二石以上。大车牲口搞运输共赚米五十七石六斗。妇女已大部完成一斗米。有的也超过了计划。冬季生产方式主要是搞运输、编草帽辫、打土坯、打柴、积灰、拾粪等。总计已生产米百余石，已完成计划的约三分之二。所以有此生产成绩，主要原因有二：（一）该村在结束土改中，补偿错斗中农及安置地主、富农的工作做得较好（被斗户都有了土地和住所，解决了生活困难）。扫除了生产障碍，群众有了“发家致富”的生产热情。另外，干群之间已消除了隔阂，能团结一致共同积极生产。（二）干部能积极带头领导。农会主任坚持村里各种工作，让所有干部都去参加及领导生产，他自己有时间也来推动大家生产，并不放弃自己的拾粪积肥。其他干部如王冬方率领群众起早搭黑搞运输，自己也赚下钱，把小车换成大车，毛驴换成骡子。在生产组织上，全村五个分队，除原有二个分队、四个互助组已组织了二十余人外，其他人都是在分队范围内自愿、灵活地三、五人结合小组，各分队干部负责督促检查。因为干部都参加组织领导，互助组又是自愿结合，大家生产劲头都很大，象王如奇、刘文芳等赚下米交了公粮还有余。此外生产与节约结合，也是获利的一个主要原因，如王冬方搞运输时牲口带草料、人带干粮，减少了路途的花费。
