　　[Telegram from the Pingzhang Front] In the battle to annihilate the 35th Army in Xinbao'an, various units and arms of the military expressed their determination to the leading organs, requesting to undertake assault missions, striving to be the "vanguard" troops, and asking to contribute all their strength to the people in the battle. This was the biggest characteristic of this battle mobilization. Many brigade and regimental commanders put forward guarantees, requesting to be "vanguard regiments." A certain regiment proposed: Carefully plan, strictly abide by policies and discipline, unite and cooperate with fraternal units, etc., to ensure that after being approved, in air-raid shelters, on mountain tops, in roadside command posts, and in kitchens, people everywhere were discussing and studying how to complete the "vanguard" mission, and the entire regiment was in full swing. The reporter saw in the political department of Regiment × that a battalion had sent many squad leaders, platoon leaders, company commanders, branch committee members, and directors of soldiers' committees, who had signed their names, affixed their seals, and even had the entire company of officers and soldiers sign and put their fingerprints on the petition. Some proposed: "We must open a breakthrough, only advance and not retreat an inch." Some proposed: "We must plant the red flag on the city wall." In these battle petitions, a common determination was implemented—to resolutely complete the assault mission and eliminate the bandit Fu's 35th Army. The 7th Company of a certain regiment, which had won seven consecutive victories in the battles of liberating Shijiazhuang, the Zhengtai Line, and liberating Sanhe, etc., wrote to the regimental committee this time, requesting to be the "vanguard company" and striving for eight consecutive victories. The 8th Company of a certain regiment has accepted the "vanguard company" mission, and all three platoons have requested to be the "vanguard platoon." At that time, they were transforming the terrain, and the company leadership proposed: whichever platoon digs the best will be the "vanguard platoon." Each platoon immediately launched a digging competition. The machine gun and artillery companies also requested to follow the assault company. Wang Juding, an artilleryman from the 2nd Company of a certain regiment, requested five times to go to the rifle squad to undertake assault missions. Under the glorious mission of completely annihilating the bandit Fu's 35th Army, the influence of the Party has been further expanded, and many soldiers have requested to join the Party at the front line. In the 2nd Company of a certain regiment alone, there were ten people who requested to join the Party at the front line. Logistics personnel were also involved in this upsurge. Liu Yongchang, the quartermaster of the 9th Company of a certain unit, led thirteen cooks to write to the company leaders and branch committee members, saying: "Guarantee to do a good job in food, guarantee to deliver meals in time, and guarantee to find all means to let the troops eat hot meals." Everyone also asked to be issued hand grenades and explosives, preparing to undertake assault missions when necessary. The fighting spirit of the accompanying civilian laborers was also very high. The 3rd Company of civilian laborers, which was fighting with a certain regiment, wrote to the regimental leaders and proposed: wherever the troops fight, we will follow, guaranteeing not to lose a single wounded soldier. In the battle to completely annihilate the bandit Fu's 35th Army on December 22, all units successfully completed their guaranteed tasks.
