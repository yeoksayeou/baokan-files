　　Nehru Government—This refers to the government of the "Dominion of Hindustan." In July 1947, British imperialism promulgated the plan for the "Partition of India and Pakistan," dividing India into two: "Hindustan" and "Pakistan." British imperialism then ordered Nehru to form the government of the "Dominion of Hindustan," appointing him as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Subsequently, the government of the "Dominion of Hindustan" is generally referred to as the Nehru Government.
　　Nehru is the chairman of the Indian National Congress Party, which represents the interests of the Indian landlords and bourgeoisie. Therefore, the policies implemented by the Nehru government entirely represent the interests of the landlords and bourgeoisie. Consequently, he shamelessly cooperates with British and American imperialism, devising a reactionary "draft constitution." This draft constitution deprives the working people of the right to vote, allows for the arbitrary arrest of people without warrants, permits the imprisonment of people without trial, oppresses workers by increasing their workload without raising wages, and threatens workers' strikes with dismissal. It does not implement the nationalization of industries, fully satisfies the interests of landlords, suppresses the peasant struggles within various princely states, protects the feudal princes within these states, and oppresses ethnic minorities. Last March, he further reactionary declared the Indian Communist Party an illegal organization, wantonly arresting democratic individuals. His foreign policy also follows the dictates of British and American imperialism, such as supporting the illegal "Small General Assembly," voting against the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea (the Soviet army has already withdrawn, referring to the American army), supporting the Dutch aggression against Indonesia, and refusing to allow the Asian Women's Conference to be held in Calcutta, India, obstructing the progress of the Asian Women's Conference. Furthermore, he allows a large influx of goods from American imperialism into India, welcomes British and American imperialist investment, and permits the non-collection of tariffs opposed by the British and Americans. All of this demonstrates that the Nehru government is a tool of British and American imperialism for invading and oppressing the Indian people.
　　Calcutta—is a large commercial port in India, located in the delta where the Ganges River flows into the sea in southeastern India. Originally a desolate small village, after the factory of the British capitalist East India Company moved here in 1686, it became a base for British capitalists to exploit and oppress the Indian people. Large quantities of raw materials were shipped from here to Britain, and large quantities of British goods were imported from here to India. Calcutta "prospered" under these circumstances. Some streets are very tidy and wide, and some buildings are very magnificent, but except for a very small number of Indian comprador bourgeoisie, the vast majority of Indian people in Calcutta live in extreme poverty due to the exploitation by British imperialism. There are also more than 7,000 overseas Chinese here, who are also subjected to exploitation and oppression by British imperialism.

    尼赫鲁政府——就是“印度斯坦”自治领政府。一九四七年七月英帝颁布“印回分治”的计划，印度就被分裂为二：“印度斯坦”和“巴基斯坦”，英帝国就命令尼赫鲁组织“印度斯坦”自治领政府，叫他做这个政府的总理兼外交部长，此后一般即叫“印度斯坦”自治领政府为尼赫鲁政府。
    尼赫鲁是印度国民大会党的主席，国民大会党代表着印度地主、资产阶级的利益，因此尼赫鲁政府所实行的政策完全是代表地主资产阶级利益的。因之，他竟无耻地与英美帝国主义合作，拟出了反动的“宪法草案”，在草案规定中，剥夺了劳动人民的投票权，不要拘票可以随意逮捕人民；不用审判就可以把人民监禁起来；压迫工人，加重工人的工作，不增加工资，并以解雇来威胁工人的罢工运动，不实行工业国有化；完全满足地主的利益，压迫各土邦内的农民斗争；保护各土邦内的封建王公；压迫少数民族。去年三月，他更反动地宣布印度共产党为非法组织，大肆逮捕民主人士；他所实行的外交政策，也是仰着英美帝国主义的鼻息，如赞成非法的“小型联大”；投票反对外国军队自朝鲜撤退（苏军已撤退，指美军），赞成荷兰侵略印尼；并且拒绝了亚洲妇女大会在印度加尔各答的召开，阻挠了亚洲妇女大会的进行；更让美帝国主义的大批货物源源流入印度，欢迎英美帝国主义投资，并允许不征收英美不同意的关税。所有这些，都说明尼赫鲁政府是英美帝国主义侵略、压迫印度人民的工具。
    加尔各答——是印度的一个大商港。在印度东南部恒河入海口的三角洲上。原是一个荒凉的小村庄，一六八六年，英国资本家开的东印度公司的工场移到这里以后，这里就成了英国大资本家剥削压榨印度人民的根据地，大量原料品都从这里运到英国去，大批的英国商品又从这里输入到印度来。加尔各答也就在这样的情况下“繁荣”起来，有些街道是很整洁而宽阔的，有些建筑物也很富丽堂皇，但是除了极少数印度的买办资产阶级以外，加尔各答的广大印度人民，都因为受着英国帝国主义的剥削而生活非常穷困。在这里还有七千多个华侨。他们也都是受着英国帝国主义的剥削与压迫。
