[Beiyue Electric] At the joint meeting of the district committees held by the Beiyue District Party Committee on the 10th of this month, a detailed discussion was held on the main tasks of the district under the new situation. On the 15th, Comrade Yang Gengtian, Secretary of the District Party Committee, made a concluding speech. Regarding the situation, Comrade Yang Gengtian first pointed out that the Beiyue District is on the eve of the liberation of Ping and Tianjin. All cadres must immediately mobilize intensively, fully support the front line, and prepare cadres to enter the city at any time. The situation is developing rapidly, and we should work intensively and not slack off in the slightest.

Regarding the current tasks, Comrade Gengtian pointed out: (1) First, it is necessary to organize strong support for the front line, and all work should be subordinate to the needs of the front line; to prepare cadres to enter the city and conduct urban education; and to formulate specific plans in advance. The first task in the new area is to stabilize people's hearts, stabilize social order, and eliminate enemy and puppet forces (armed secret agents, bandits, and spies), widely publicize our party's policies and the political situation, and explain that these areas will forever belong to the people, in order to raise the awareness and consciousness of the masses. Secondly, it is necessary to mobilize the masses in a planned and step-by-step manner, train activists (party members, workers, peasants, and rural intellectuals), and establish people's power. Third, according to the party's policies and the demands of the masses, and the different conditions in different regions, carry out certain economic reforms separately and step by step. But do not be overanxious for quick results.

(2) In order to welcome new victories, it is necessary to boldly cultivate and promote cadres, and conscientiously organize cadres to study; improve the theoretical and policy level of cadres, and effectively solve the difficulties of cadres' families.

(3) Regarding production: Developing industrial and agricultural production is one of the important keys to defeating the enemy. In order to support the war, carry out long-term construction in the liberated areas, and build a new China, we must vigorously strengthen production leadership in order to achieve the goal of increasing industrial and agricultural production by an inch. The first thing is to vigorously organize the masses to carry out winter production and lay the foundation for launching a large-scale production campaign next year. And seize the opportunity to reorganize cooperatives and carry out various kinds of economic mutual assistance movements, large and small, and after the practical experience of the masses, the party committee leadership should summarize and help improve them.

(4) Regarding the end of land reform and party rectification, he introduced the progress of the end of land reform in the district and gave instructions on the requirements and steps for ending land reform and party rectification in the future. Conclusion of Land Reform Work: A total of 5,656 villages in the entire Beiyue District have carried out land reform. According to statistics from the First, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Sub-districts: there are more than 2,900 villages with remaining problems; after this work, about 65% of the problems have been solved. As far as the villages in the whole district that have carried out land reform are concerned, most of the villages have revised their class status, and necessary compensation has been made to the wrongly struggled middle peasants, and landlords and rich peasants have been resettled (some villages still have remnants, but there are not many villages with serious problems). After carrying out this work, the masses further understood the party's policies, people's hearts were stabilized, and the peasants' enthusiasm for production was improved. This can be explained by the fact that the masses in most areas were very active in this year's autumn plowing and wheat planting. During the process of carrying out the work, after correcting the "left" deviation, a "counterattack" by landlords and rich peasants once occurred in individual areas, beating poor peasant group cadres and pulling away the livestock that the poor peasants had been distributed, and other right-wing deviations were basically overcome soon. Estimation of the achievements of Party Rectification: After the initial Party Rectification in the entire district, the party has moved forward; the ideology, position, and work style of the party's cadres have been transformed. The policy level has been improved; the party members of the rural branches have further understood the relationship between the party and the masses, and recognized the role of the party. Not only have party members been educated, but the masses have also been educated. We can recall that before the Party Rectification, many cadres had serious dangerous tendencies of liberalism, corruption, and landlord and rich peasant thinking; in rural areas, cadres forced orders and were extremely detached from the masses. After the Party Rectification, all have been greatly improved. The requirements and steps for ending land reform and party rectification in the future are: all villages that have carried out land reform and still have remaining problems are required to bring this work to an end in conjunction with party rectification before the spring plowing next year. The way to carry out the work: villages with more problems should be selected as the key points, and the nearby areas should be driven to carry out the work at the same time. It is necessary to distinguish the rights and wrongs from a pragmatic approach, from specific circumstances, to prevent uniformity and make mistakes again. The fruits that should have been divided but have already been divided are generally not returned; those that should have been divided but have been divided too much should be returned appropriately; those that have not been divided should be returned; those that should be divided should be divided. Generally, the means of production and livestock that have been divided are not suitable for return, and can be handled through consultation. Those who have been struggled against because of corruption and decline are not returned, but those who cannot live or have special difficulties can be resettled.

In short, the end of land reform should achieve: revising class status, resolving land disputes, resettling landlords and rich peasants, and appropriately compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants; to achieve the goal of unity and production. The villages that have achieved this goal will finally announce the end of land reform, so that the masses can concentrate on production. If there is not enough time, land certificates should be issued with emphasis, at least three or four villages can be issued in each district, and they will be issued universally after the spring plowing next year (some villages can do some preparatory work, such as publicity, land registration, etc.). Party Rectification: Villages with more branch problems can be carried out in detail in accordance with the regulations of the central government. General villages should focus on strengthening education, training village cadres and party members, solving current problems, and universally carrying out basic knowledge education of the party to improve the branch. Take key villages to drive nearby areas, understand the situation, solve problems, and seek key demonstrations to drive and complete the party rectification work in a piece. In the Party Rectification, we should prevent tailism, purely disciplinary sanctions, excessive struggles, and even the deviation of dividing party members into several categories for rectification.

　　北岳区党委举行地委联席会
  　号召干部紧张工作
    杨耕田同志指出当前各项重要任务
    【北岳电】北岳区党委于本月十日召开的地委联席会议上，对全区在新形势下的主要任务进行了详细讨论。十五日由区党委书记杨耕田同志做了总结性的发言。关于形势方面，杨耕田同志首先指出：北岳区正处在平、津即将解放的前夜，全体干部必须立即紧张的动员起来，全力支援前线，并准备干部随时入城。形势发展迅速，我们应紧张工作不能丝毫松懈。
    关于目前任务问题，耕田同志指出：（一）首先，要组织大力支援前线，各种工作服从前线需要；要准备干部入城，并进行城市教育；与事先订出具体计划。新区工作首先要安定人心，稳定社会秩序，肃清敌伪势力（武装特务、土匪、奸细活动），广泛宣传我党政策和政治形势，说明这些地区将永远为人民所有，以提高群众的认识和觉悟。其次要有计划、有步骤地发动群众，训练积极分子（党员、工农群众）、乡村知识分子、建立人民政权。第三、根据党的政策和群众要求，和不同地区的不同情况，分别地、有步骤地进行一定的经济改革。但不能操之过急。
    （二）为了迎接新的胜利，必须放手培养提拔干部，认真组织干部学习；提高干部的理论与政策水平，并对干部家属困难切实给予解决。
    （三）关于生产：发展工农业生产，是战胜敌人重要关键之一。为了支援战争、长期建设解放区，建设新中国，必须大力加强生产领导，以达到工农业生产提高一寸的目的。首先是大力组织群众进行冬季生产，打下明年开展大生产运动的基础。并抓紧整理合作社，开展大大小小的各种各样的经济互助运动，经过群众实际经验，党委领导上加以总结帮助提高。
    （四）结束土改和整党方面，介绍了全区结束土改进行的情况，并对今后结束土改、整党的要求步骤等分别给予指示。土改结束工作：全北岳区共五千六百五十六村进行了土改。据一、三、五、六分区统计：有遗留问题的二千九百余村；此次进行工作后，已解决问题的约占百分之六十五。就全区进行土改村庄说来，多数村庄已改订了成份，对错斗中农进行了必要的补偿，安置了地主富农（其中一部分村庄还留有尾巴，但问题严重的村子不多了）。进行这一工作之后，群众进一步了解了党的政策，人心安定了，农民的生产情绪提高了。从大部地区群众在今年秋耕、种麦中，劳动很为积极，就可说明。工作进行过程中，在纠正左的偏向之后，个别地区又曾一度发生地主、富农“反攻”，打贫农团干部；拉了贫农分得的牲口等右的偏向，不久也基本上得到了克服。整党成绩的估计：全区经过初步整党之后，党是前进了；党的干部思想、立场、作风有了转变。政策水平提高了；农村支部党员进一步了解了党和群众的关系，认识了党的作用。不但党员受到教育，群众也受到了教育。我们可以回忆一下，整党前不少干部存在着自由主义、贪污腐化和地主富农思想；在农村中，干部强迫命令，脱离群众极为严重的危险倾向。经过整党后，都得到了极大的改进。今后结束土改整党的要求、步骤是：所有进行过土改仍有遗留问题的村庄，一律要求于明年春耕前，结合整党将此工作告一段落。进行工作的方式：应选择问题较多村庄作重点，并带动附近一片同时进行工作。必须分别具体情况，从实事求是出发。把是非责任分清，以防止千篇一律，再出毛病。关于应分而已分的果实一般不退；应分而分得太多的，要适当退出一部；未分应退的退；该分的分了它。一般生产工具、牲口已分的，以不退为宜，可协商处理。因贪污多得、下降户等原因被斗的不退，但不能生活或特别困难的可加以安置。
    总之，结束土改应做到：改订成份，解决土地纠纷，安置地富，适当补偿错斗中农；达到团结生产的目的。达成此一目的的村庄，即最后宣布结束土改，使群众安心生产。如时间来不及，土地证应有重点的颁发，至少每区可发三、四村，等到明年春耕后普遍发（有些村可做些准备工作，如宣传、登记土地等）。整党问题：支部问题较多村庄，可按中央规定办法详细进行。一般村庄应以加强教育，训练村干部党员为主，解决当前存在的问题，并应普遍进行党的基本知识教育，把支部提高一步。以重点村带动附近一片，了解情况，解决问题，以求重点示范带动与完成一片的整党工作。在整党中应防止尾巴主义、单纯纪律制裁过火的斗争、甚至把党员分成几类整的偏向发生。
