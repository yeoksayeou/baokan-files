Editor's Note: Our newspaper receives many opinions and appeals regarding marriage issues every day. To ensure a correct resolution to this matter, we are publishing this article and hope that everyone will study and discuss it. We encourage our readers to express their opinions directly and freely, or to have someone write on their behalf. Let us all discuss this to arrive at a correct conclusion.

　　In rural North China, social and economic foundations have changed after the land reform, and the peasants' awareness has greatly increased. Marriage freedom and the establishment of happy and fulfilling families have become the demands of the vast number of male and female peasants. At the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference, a motion was proposed and passed to revise the previous marriage regulations of the two border regions. Currently, the new marriage regulations have not been promulgated, but there are many unresolved and improperly handled issues in various local works. We would like to raise our opinions on several of the most common problems and hope to stimulate discussion and criticism from all sectors:

　　(1) What constitutes genuine marriage freedom, and how should it be handled when one party proposes a divorce but the other insists on staying married?

　　Marriage should be voluntary for both men and women. Parents, cadres, and any other third party should not interfere or arrange marriages. For those who are already married, if the relationship is poor and cohabitation is unbearable, divorce should be granted whether it is insisted upon by both parties or either party, and after mediation has failed. Only in this way can genuine marriage freedom be achieved. Because marriage is a union of emotions, only with affection can there be happiness and fulfillment, and only then can there be a democratic, harmonious, and prosperous new family. If there is no affection between husband and wife, no equal human rights, and no proper democracy in the family, and if it is only maintained by feudal rule, it will not achieve genuine democracy and harmony, and it will be difficult to work together for production and wealth.

　　(2) If both husband and wife or either party (he or she) has an improper relationship with another person and requests a divorce, should it be allowed? After the divorce, should marriage with their "lover" be approved?

　　Recently, some individuals in Jianping County, Beiyue, have twice submitted anonymous letters stating that "bad women who engage in improper relationships should not be elevated, and these people should not be allowed to divorce; they should be subject to the control of their husbands..." We believe that these improper relationships are mainly caused by poverty and the lack of marriage freedom. Only through land reform, productive labor, improved family life, and women gradually gaining the ability and awareness to live independently, as well as the genuine implementation of marriage policies, will this gradually be resolved. Chaotic sexual behavior among men and women is not good and should be properly educated and criticized. However, we should understand that the more freedom there is, the less this kind of chaotic phenomenon will occur. Therefore, whether or not both parties or either party has an improper relationship, as long as they can no longer cohabit and insist on divorce, divorce should be granted. There should be complete freedom in remarriage after divorce. The provision that "those who are sentenced to divorce for adultery or who have been sentenced for a crime shall not marry the adulterer" contains elements of maintaining feudalism and restricts the marriage freedom of some people. This provision should be revised immediately.

　　(3) When a widow remarries or a woman from a family with daughters but no sons marries, how should the property and residence issues be handled?

　　According to the spirit of the Land Law Outline, which states that men and women, young and old, have equal rights to family property, and the principle of marriage freedom, a widow who remarries or takes her dependent children with her has the right to dispose of her own and her children's land and property. When a widow remarries or a woman from a family with daughters but no sons marries, if the couple voluntarily chooses to reside there, it is a matter of freedom of residence, and others should not interfere. In some areas of Jinnan, the phenomenon of not allowing widows to remarry with their property, or expelling them from the village because they marry someone, is a violation of human rights and property rights and should be educated and effectively corrected.

　　(4) If a revolutionary soldier has been missing for many years, should his wife or fiancée be allowed to file for divorce or annul the engagement according to the law?

　　For the sake of the rapid victory of the Liberation War, military dependents should wait for a certain period of time. This temporary self-sacrifice is a glorious exchange for the victory of the Chinese people and the long-term benefits of the complete liberation of women, and it comes with a price. However, these temporary self-sacrifices cannot be unlimited; unlimited sacrifices not only increase women's suffering but also directly increase obstacles to military recruitment. Therefore, if a revolutionary soldier has been missing for a long time, his wife or fiancée should be allowed to divorce or annul the engagement according to the legally prescribed time limit.

　　关于婚姻问题的意见
    杨蕴玉　田秀娟
    编者按：本报每日接到许多有关婚姻问题的意见和呼声，为使这一个问题求得正确解决，本报特发表此文，希望大家都来研究讨论，希望广大读者直接地自由地发表自己的意见，或请人代笔提出意见，大家都来讨论，以求得出正确的结论。
    　
    华北农村中，经过土地改革，社会经济基础已改变，农民觉悟大大提高：婚姻自由和建立美满的幸福家庭，已成为广大男女农民的要求。华北临时人民代表会上，曾提出并通过了修改前两边区婚姻条例的议案。目前新的婚姻条例尚未公布，但各地工作中存在着许多没有解决的和部分处理不当的问题，现就几个最普遍的问题，提出我们的意见，愿引起各界的讨论与批评：
    （一）怎样才算真正的婚姻自由，一方提出离婚对方坚持不离，应如何处理？
    结婚要男女双方自愿，家长、父母、干部以及其他任何第三者，不得干涉包办。已婚者因感情恶劣，不堪同居，无论双方或任何一方坚持提出离婚，且经调解无效时，都应准其离婚，这样才能达到真正的婚姻自由。因为婚姻是感情的结合，有感情才能美满幸福，才能有民主和睦富裕的新家庭，如果夫妇间没有感情，没有平等的人权，家庭中没有适当民主，只靠封建统治勉强去维系，就不能达到真正民主和睦，也难以齐心合力生产，发家致富。
    （二）夫妻双方或任何一方（他与她）有不正常的男女关系，并请求离婚时否可以允许？在离婚以后和其“相好”结婚，是否应该批准？
    最近北岳建屏县个别人，曾两次以匿名信提出“搞男女关系的坏女人，不应提高，不要允许这些人离婚，她们应该受丈夫的管束……。”我们认为这种不正常的男女关系，主要是由于生活贫困和婚姻没有自由而形成的，只有经过土改、生产劳动，家庭生活得到改善，妇女也逐渐取得独立生活的本领和觉悟，以及婚姻政策的真正贯彻，才会逐渐得到解决。男女性生活的混乱是不好的，应进行适当教育和批评，但我们应了解，越不自由这种混乱现象就会越多。因此男女双方或一方不管有没有不正常的男女关系，只要无法再同居，而坚持离婚者，都可准其离婚。在已经离婚后再行结婚时，应有完全自由。“因奸判决离婚或受刑之宣告者，不得与相奸者结婚”的规定，含有维护封建的因素，限止了一些人的婚姻自由，这种规定应即修改。
    （三）寡妇再嫁或有女无子家庭中之女子结婚时，其财产与居住问题应如何处理？
    根据土地法大纲中，不分男女老幼，对其家庭财产，均有同等权利的精神及婚姻自由的原则，寡妇改嫁或带其需要抚养的子女改嫁时，有处理本人及所带女子女的土地财产权利。寡妇再嫁或有女无子家庭中之女子结婚时，夫妇自愿仍居方者，属于居住自由，他人不得干涉。冀南某些地方，不许寡妇带产改嫁，或因同某人结婚，即驱逐出村的现象，是侵犯人权财权的行为，应给以教育，并进行有效的纠正。
    （四）革命军人多年无音信，其妻或未婚妻，应否依法提出离婚或解除婚约？
    为了解放战争的迅速胜利，军属应作一定时期的等待，以此部分的暂时的自我牺牲，换取中国人民的胜利，和妇女彻底解放的长远利益，是有代价的光荣的。但这些暂时的自我牺牲，不能是无限度的；无限度的牺牲不仅是增加了妇女痛苦，而且亦直接增加了参军工作的障碍。因此革命军人长期无音信者，应依法定年限，准许其妻或未婚妻离婚或解除婚约。
