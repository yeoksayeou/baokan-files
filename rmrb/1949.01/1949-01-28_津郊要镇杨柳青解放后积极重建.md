[Jizhong Electric] Workers in various industries in Yangliuqing, an important town on the Jinxi Railway in the western suburbs of Tianjin, have played an extremely important pioneering role in protecting public enterprises before liberation and in restoring and building after liberation. The 37 workers in the weapons repair shop, led courageously by Huang Jiwu, the chief of the engineering section, resolutely refused the transfer order from the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandits before the war. During the war, in order to resist the sabotage of the bandit troops entrenched in Yangliuqing, they waged several tenacious struggles and finally protected all the repair machines in the shop, as well as the original stock of more than 500 rifles and six machine guns. Railway workers actively protected various materials when the order at the station was extremely chaotic. The city's electric lighting lines were intact under the guard of the electricity workers. Telephone workers automatically helped the troops to erect lines, repair them, and check the lines. Many workers from the railway and telecommunications departments have reported to the Military Control Commission to resume work.
[Another dispatch] The city's various industries are rapidly recovering, and the people's morale is extremely high. Yangliuqing has taken on a new look. Merchants and civilians have resumed business one after another, and all schools have opened. The city's post office began providing postal services to all liberated areas outside the city on the third day after our army's liberation. The newly published Hebei Daily has also been distributed to the entire city through this post office. The city's democratic order has been established. Of the original 444 larger commercial firms and shops, more than 300 have resumed business. Most of the remaining thousands of merchants and vendors have also opened their doors. All ten primary and secondary schools in the city (including Yuqing Middle School and Jianyi Normal School) have reopened with the full support of the Municipal Military Control Commission. In order to build this nationally renowned railway hub of Yangliuqing, cadres throughout the city are adopting experiences from various places and working with the citizens to fully restore and build the city.

　　津郊要镇杨柳青解放后积极重建
    【冀中电】津西铁路要镇杨柳青各行工人，无论是解放前对公营企业的保护上及解放后的恢复与建设上，都起了极其重要的先锋作用。武器修械所的三十七个工人，在工程股长黄纪伍的勇敢带动下，在战前曾坚决拒绝了蒋傅匪的转运命令；在战时为了抵抗困守在杨柳青匪军的破坏，做了数次的顽强斗争，终于保护了该所的全部修械机器，和原存的五百余支大枪，六挺机枪。铁路工人在车站秩序极度混乱的时候，积极保护了各种器材。全市的电灯线路，在电灯工人的看守下，完整无损。电话工人自动帮助部队架线、修理和查线。铁路和电讯两处工人，已有很多向军管会报到复工。
    【又电】该市各业迅速恢复，人民情绪极为高涨，杨柳青面貌已焕然一新。商民纷纷复业，学校全部开学，市内邮局在我军解放后的第三天已向市外各解放区通邮，新出版的河北日报也已通过此局分发全市。全市民主秩序已经建立。过去旧有的四百四十四户较大的商行店铺，先后复业的已达三百余户。其余千户以上的行商和摊贩，也已大部开张。全市十处中小学校（内有育青中学、简易师范），在市军管会竭力扶植下，已全部开学。全市干部为了建设这个名闻全国的铁路重镇杨柳青，正采用着各地经验，协同市民以全力进行该市的恢复与建设工作。
