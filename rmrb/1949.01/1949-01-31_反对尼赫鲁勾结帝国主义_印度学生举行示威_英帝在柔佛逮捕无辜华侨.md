　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Indian students continue to oppose the Nehru government's collusion with imperialism. According to Agence France-Presse: On the opening day of the "Asian Conference" (20th), demonstrations continued in Calcutta. Three trams and three buses were destroyed by students.

　　According to TASS, while the "Asian Conference" was being held in Delhi, a mass meeting commemorating Moscow, the Soviet capital, initiated by the "Indian Caravan" Association, was held in Delhi. The audience listened with great interest to the report given by the representative of the All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. The conference also screened a film depicting the celebration of Moscow's 800th anniversary. More than 1,000 people visited the photo exhibition on Moscow.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Following the arrest of 500 Overseas Chinese in Kayang, south of Kuala Lumpur, on January 11th, by the British authorities in Malaya, in accordance with their "New Emergency Regulations" which specialize in persecuting Overseas Chinese, they arrested another 500 innocent compatriots in Johor on the 19th. These Overseas Chinese are now being detained (Associated Press, 20th). They and their families will be escorted to the Kuomintang-controlled areas to be slaughtered by the Chinese reactionaries. Prior to this, British High Commissioner in Malaya, MacDonald, delivered a provocative radio speech on the 16th, falsely declaring that "Britain hopes that Malaya will one day gain autonomy"; issuing shameless slanders about so-called "rebels fighting against the British army" wanting to seize Malaya and let "Chinese thugs rule." However, the reality in Malaya ruthlessly exposed the political conspiracy of British imperialism to strangle the national liberation movements of the various peoples of Malaya. Following his shameless statement, the British authorities in Malaya then announced the extension of the martial law implemented last June for another three months.

    印度学生举行示威
  　英帝在柔佛逮捕无辜华侨
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】印度学生继续反对尼赫鲁政府与帝国主义的勾结。据法新社电：“亚洲会议”开幕之日（二十日），加尔各答市继续发生示威。有三辆电车及三辆公共汽车被学生击毁。
    又据塔斯社电，值“亚洲会议”在德里开会期间，由“印度卡拉凡”协会发起专为纪念苏联首都莫斯科的群众大会，曾在德里举行。听众以极大的兴趣听取全苏对外文化关系协会代表描述的报告。大会并放映描绘庆祝莫斯科八百周年的电影。有一千余人曾参观了关于莫斯科的照片展览会。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】马来亚英国当局依照其专事残害华侨的“新紧急条例”，于一月十一日在吉隆坡以南的加央逮捕了华侨五百人之后，十九日又在柔佛逮捕无辜侨胞五百人。这些华侨现在均被拘禁中（美联社二十日电）。他们及其眷属将被押送到国民党统治区，供中国反动派去杀害。在此以前，英驻马来亚高级专员麦克唐纳，于十六日发表了一个挑拨性的广播演讲，虚伪地声明“英国盼望马来亚能有一日获得自治”；发出所谓“对英军作战的叛军”，想夺取马来亚让“中国暴徒统治”的无耻谰言。可是，马来亚的现实却无情地揭穿了英帝国主义企图扼杀马来亚各民族人民运动的政治阴谋。在他这一无耻声明发表之后，马来亚英国当局接着就宣布将其去年六月实施的戒严令延长三个月。
