    Ho Chi Minh -- One of the leaders of the Vietnamese Communist Party, and the President of the United Government of the Republic of Vietnam. He is currently 59 years old and was born in Yi Jing, Vietnam. In his youth, he participated in the movement against French imperialism, but because the Vietnamese colonial authorities were pursuing him, he changed his name and disguised himself to work on ocean liners. He traveled to France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States, and Japan, and learned the languages of each of those countries. He joined the Communist Party in France and later studied in the Soviet Union. From 1915, he studied in Hong Kong for six years and also learned Chinese. During the Chinese Revolution, he went to China. In 1927, he organized a Marxist Vietnamese Overseas Chinese group in Hong Kong, and soon after, he organized the Vietnamese Communist Youth League. In 1930, under his leadership, the Vietnamese Communist Party was finally established. He led many independent demonstrations. When the Japanese imperialists launched the Pacific War, he led the Vietnamese people to resist Japanese imperialism and established the "Vietnam Independence League" (abbreviated as Viet Minh), and formed tens of thousands of guerrillas to carry out the war of resistance against Japan. After Japan surrendered, on September 2, 1945, the Republic of Vietnam and the provisional government were officially established, and he was appointed as the President. In March 1946, the provisional government was changed to a united government including various parties and non-party individuals. In October of the same year, the second People's Assembly was held, and the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (the first democratic constitution in East Asia) was passed, and he was elected as the first President of the Republic of Vietnam. In November, he was elected as the Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the new democratic government. In the struggle for independence against French imperialism, the Vietnam People's Liberation Army under his leadership has grown from 30,000 in 1945 to more than 300,000 regular troops and more than one million militiamen (1947 statistics).
    Under his leadership, the Republic of Vietnam has implemented land reform, abolished the poll tax and all exorbitant taxes, confiscated the property of Japanese and French invaders and Vietnamese traitors, nationalized the imperialist banks, implemented tariff autonomy, and improved the people's livelihood.
    In June of last year, the Vietnamese traitor Nguyen Yuan Chun signed an agreement with France on the establishment of an "independent and unified state" including the three regions of Tokyo, Annam, and Cochinchina within the French Federation. Ho Chi Minh refused to recognize this agreement that sold out the interests of the Vietnamese people, and continued to lead the Vietnamese Liberation Army to fight the French army.
    General Markos -- is the current Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Army of Greece, the Prime Minister of the Greek People's Government, and the Minister of the Army. He was born in 1906 in Asia Minor to a teacher's family. Due to the early death of his parents, he worked as a stonemason from the age of eleven, and later as an agricultural worker. In 1923, Turkey expelled Greek nationals, and he returned to Thessaloniki via Istanbul. In 1924, he worked in tobacco factories in Kavala and Macedonia, and from that year he joined the Communist Youth League. In 1926, he was called into the army and served as a cavalry sergeant. At that time, he began to pay attention to military research. After his discharge, he became an active figure in trade unions and democratic organizations. In 1934, he became a formal party member. In the ten years from 1927 to 1938, he lived almost entirely underground, in exile, and in prison. In 1938, the fascist reactionary dictator of Greece, Metaxas, exiled him to the island of Odes (southern tip of Crete), which is known for its harsh climate. Here he encountered Mussolini's invasion of Greece. He and other "democratic prisoners" jointly demanded that they be sent to the front line, but were rejected by Metaxas. It was not until Greece was occupied by Germany that he escaped from the island of Odes. He participated in and became one of the organizers of the National Liberation Front. He formed the first unit of the Greek People's Liberation Army in the mountains. When he served as the commander of the Eighth Division of the Liberation Army, he launched a struggle against the German occupation forces in Western Macedonia, winning repeatedly and deterring the German forces in Macedonia. In 1941, he became the commander of the Democratic Army. In mid-1944, he organized and commanded the Macedonian Division of the Greek Democratic Army. In October of that year, he defeated the German fascist security battalion and liberated Thessaloniki. In 1946, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Democratic Army. In December 1947, he was appointed as the Prime Minister of the Interim Democratic Government of Greece and the Minister of the Army, leading the Greek progressive parties and commanding the Greek democratic army in a courageous and resolute struggle against the reactionary royalist government of Greece.
