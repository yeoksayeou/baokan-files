Taihang Telegram: Experience in many areas of Taihang shows that it is necessary to simultaneously mobilize and lead the masses in production while concluding land reform. This not only satisfies the current production needs of the masses and lays a sufficient foundation for organized large-scale production after the conclusion of land reform, but also makes the conclusion of land reform more convenient because it does not violate the farming season. In villages that have done this, the production enthusiasm of the masses is generally high, and the conclusion of land reform work is more supported by the masses. Conversely, in some places, because the purpose of concluding land reform is not clear, cadres have the idea of simply completing the task, do not pay attention to implementing production education, and do not lead the current winter production. Although land reform has ended, production has not been well mobilized. For example, the method of concluding land reform in Lucheng is to concentrate the cadres, conclude this half of the joint defense, and then conclude that half of the joint defense. After completing the task, the cadres transferred, and production was left unattended. The cadres of the Second District said that the masses' production enthusiasm was very high after the conclusion of land reform, but no one was leading it. Dongzhaiyang Village in Neiqiu did not do a good job in publicizing policies to resolve the masses' uneasy thoughts when concluding land reform, so households with more land were afraid of land being taken away, and households with less land waited to be allocated more. The cadres were only busy with the specific work of concluding land reform. Although a one-month textile plan was drawn up after the autumn harvest, it largely failed because of lack of leadership and inspection. Each woman was originally scheduled to spin four ounces of thread per day, but only completed one and a half qian. In Dongningjing Village, Xiangyuan, the masses rely on going up the mountain to cut strips and weave them in spring and winter every year to solve half a year's food rations, but the work team demanded meetings every day, stopping them from going up the mountain. Both cadres and the masses were very dissatisfied. Later, after listening to the masses' feedback, the cadres divided the work to lead, combined with casual talks on the mountain to understand the situation, and after carrying out winter production, the masses' enthusiasm rose. In terms of the combination method, most of them first started with inspecting, mobilizing, and organizing production, deeply and widely publicizing the purpose, policies, and methods of concluding land reform, stabilizing people's hearts, and dispelling the masses' ideological concerns. Then, they divided the work to lead, with some cadres specializing in leading the masses in production, combining ideological mobilization, and implementing the education of the prospects of organizing to develop production into every link of the conclusion of land reform. They inspected and promoted at any time, conducted awards at a certain stage, and finally conducted systematic summary education, current affairs and future education, and organized production education in the summary of land reform to further consolidate and improve the masses' ideological awareness and promote the large-scale production movement, so that the conclusion of land reform and organized production were organically connected. The experience of Tazhang Village in Gaoyi is to first conduct in-depth policy propaganda among the branch, the peasant association, and the entire masses, explaining the purpose and methods of concluding land reform. The cadres specifically divided the work to lead, on the one hand rectifying the branch and the peasant association, carrying out ideological mobilization, and establishing a temporary people's representative meeting to prepare for the conclusion of land reform; on the other hand, organizing and leading the masses in production. After formulating the plan, they also discussed the production work. And continued to implement production education, and smoothly completed the conclusion of land reform. Finally, systematic summary education was carried out, and various meetings were held separately (such as compensating and resettling well-to-do middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants after the misfights), continuing to explain the party's policies, calling for unity and organization for production, and discussing and deploying winter production work. The village has now established a small-scale cooperative, organized seven transportation teams, three small peddlers, one oil mill team, and thirteen textile mutual aid teams to carry out organized and planned production. In addition, some places (such as Changling and Dajing villages in Xiyang) organized the masses to contract projects and repair land after compensating and distributing floating wealth and grain.

　　太行不少地区经验证明：
  　在结束土改工作中必须同时领导生产
    【太行电】太行不少地区经验证明：在结束土改中必须同时发动与领导群众进行生产。这样不但满足了群众当前的生产要求，及给结束土改后的组织起来大生产打下充分的基础，并且由于不违农时，使结束土改工作的进行也更加便利。凡是如此做了的村庄，群众的生产积极性就普遍高涨，结束土改工作更为群众所支持。反之，有些地方因为对结束土改的目的性不明确，干部思想存在着单纯完成任务的观点，没有注意贯串生产教育，没有领导当前的冬季生产，虽然土改结束了，生产也未很好发动起来。如潞城的结束土改方法，是把干部集中起来，结束了这半个联防，再结束那半个联防。完成任务，干部转移后，生产无人领导而自流着。二区干部说结束土改后群众生产情绪很高，但是没有人领导。内邱东寨阳村在结束土改中没有很好宣传政策以解决群众的不安思想，致地多一些的户怕抽地，地少一些的户等待再分些，干部只忙于结束土改的具体工作，虽然在秋后即订出了一月纺织计划，但由于无领导，无检查，也大部落了空。每个妇女原订每天纺线四两，结果只完成了一钱半。襄垣东宁静村群众每年靠春冬两季上山割条编织以解决半年口粮，工作组却要求每天开会，停止上山。干部群众都非常不满。后来听取群众反映，干部分工领导，结合上山漫谈了解情况，开展冬季生产后，群众情绪才高涨起来。在结合的方法上，大部都是先从检查动员组织生产入手，深入广泛宣传结束土改的目的、政策与作法，安定人心，解除群众的思想顾虑，然后分工领导，以一部分干部专门领导群众进行生产，结合思想发动，把组织起来发展生产的前途教育贯串到结束土改的每一个环节中，随时检查推动，到一个阶段进行评奖，最后在总结土改中进行系统的总结教育、时事前途教育、组织起来生产教育，以进一步巩固与提高群众的思想觉悟，推动大生产运动，使结束土改与组织起来进行生产有机的连接起来。高邑塔张村经验，是先在支部、农会及全体群众中进行深入的政策宣传，说明结束土改的目的与作法，干部具体分工领导，一方面整顿支部、农会，进行思想发动，成立临时人民代表会议，准备结束土改；一方面组织领导群众进行生产。在制定方案后，又对生产工作进行了讨论。并继续贯串了生产教育，顺利的完成了结束土改。最后进行了系统的总结教育，并分别召开各种不同的会议（如补偿、安置后的误斗中农、地富等），继续说明党的政策，号召团结组织起来生产，讨论布置冬季生产工作。该村现已建立了小型社，组织起七个运输组，三个小商贩，一个油房组，十三个纺织互助组，进行有组织有计划的生产。另外也有些地方（如昔阳长岭、达井等村）把浮财、粮食等补偿分配后，即组织群众进行包工、修地等生产。
