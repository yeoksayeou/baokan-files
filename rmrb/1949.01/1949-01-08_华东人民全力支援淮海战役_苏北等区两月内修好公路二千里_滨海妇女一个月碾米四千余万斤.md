Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th -- Under the leadership of the democratic government, the people of the East China Liberated Area are devoting all their energy to support the unprecedentedly large-scale Huaihai Campaign. In addition to organizing a large number of stretcher teams and cart teams to go to the front lines, the people of the region are now actively stepping up the completion of various war service tasks and have achieved great results.

In terms of repairing roads and bridges to ensure wartime transportation: Hundreds of thousands of people in Central and Southern Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Huaihai, Yancheng and other regions have successively repaired 2,250 li of roads and 530 bridges in two months, ensuring that the main transportation lines in all directions of the front line are unblocked. When repairing roads in Northern Jiangsu, materials and technical personnel were in short supply, but the hard work of the people still enabled the project to be completed ahead of schedule. People in the water network area of Northern Jiangsu actively repaired bridges and dams to welcome the People's Liberation Army. The masses in three townships in the Linze District of Gaoyou County repaired a twelve-li road in one and a half days and also repaired six bridges. The Fu'an District of Dongtai newly built and repaired 85 bridges. After the roads and bridges were completed, people in many areas automatically organized road protection teams to maintain traffic.

In terms of rice milling and grain transportation: Hundreds of thousands of women in Binhai milled over 40 million jin of rice in one month. Women in Junan (Xin County) milled rice without sleep for several nights and completed the task of over 9 million jin in three days. Fushan District of Pingyi completed the task of 116,000 jin of rice milling in three days, and achieved a rate of 98% of rice without rice bran. The people of the Bohai area formed 3,000 large carts and over 50,000 small carts to transport military grain. Among the 450,000 civilian laborers who were successively invested in supporting the front line in Binhai, 280,000 participated in rear transportation. More than 10,000 civilian laborers in Yudong and Jubei (Xin County) transported all 1.5 million jin of public grain to their destinations in two days. The Sixth Division of Central China had a total of 28,000 carts, 6,482 donkeys, 4,000 ox carts, and more than 200 sailboats to transport military supplies. Among the 200,000 people in Jianghuai who were invested in supporting the front line, 40,000 people worked day and night to transport grain. In Suqian, which was only recently recovered for three months, there were more than 2,700 carts in the city participating in grain transportation. After the entire county of Tancheng was recovered, grain stations and civilian stations were set up on all important traffic roads, and tens of thousands of jin of grain were concentrated every day to supply the troops and civilian laborers. On the third day after the liberation of Yi County, the peasants enthusiastically paid public grain. Peasants in Pi (County), Sui (County), Tong (Mountain), Sui (County), Xiao (County), and Tong (Mountain) (all newly established counties) have successively paid 9 million jin of public grain.

In addition to undertaking tasks such as rice milling, women in various places also sewed cotton clothes, quilts, and socks for the People's Liberation Army day and night. Women in Bohai rushed to sew 600,000 pairs of military socks, 200,000 cotton quilts, and more than 600,000 grain bags for days. Women in Changyi and Yexian, Jiaodong, completed 220,000 pairs of military socks in half a month through day and night assaults. Women in the Central and Southern Shandong region are guaranteed to complete the task of one million pairs of military shoes before the new year.

Workers in rear factories support the front lines by stepping up production. Workers in a factory in Northern Jiangsu voluntarily stopped all holidays and extended their working hours from nine to twelve hours. In the past, the work that required two people to do in the instrument department of the Jiaodong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory now only requires one person to do it, and the output of surgical instruments is increased by 14% to 16% per month. The eleven sewing machine frames for sewing shoe uppers in the shoe factory of the Second Clothing Factory of the East China Clothing Bureau have increased from 660 pairs of finished products per day to 880 pairs, while maintaining the original quality. A large number of automobiles and other transportation tools from various rear agencies have successively gone to the Huaihai front line to serve.
