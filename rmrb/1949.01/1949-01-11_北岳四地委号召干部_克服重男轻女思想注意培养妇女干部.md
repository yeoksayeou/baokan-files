　　Beiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee Calls on Cadres to Overcome the Idea of ​​Giving Preference to Sons Over Daughters and Pay Attention to Cultivating Women Cadres
　　[Report from this newspaper] In order to strengthen women's work, the Fourth Sub-district recently convened a meeting of women cadres from various counties. At the meeting, the responsible comrades of the prefectural committee made important speeches on the current ideological and organizational preference for men over women, and how to strengthen women's work in the future. First, they strictly exposed the feudal backward thinking of "giving preference to sons over daughters," saying: This backward view still exists among many party member cadres: from an organizational point of view, we have not paid attention to promoting women cadres, and have not appropriately allocated all capable women cadres to various departments. Women cadres only account for 10.8% of the male cadres in the entire district's party, government, and civilian cadres. From an ideological point of view: some comrades despise working women, one-sidedly emphasizing culture, and rejecting female cadres who cannot write reports. When it came to assigning female cadres to various government departments, the secretary of the Pingshan County government firmly opposed it, saying, "What's the point of doing that? If I bring my wife and children here, they won't be able to work but they will eat!" Individual comrades from the Fuping County Party Committee and the government's finance department often satirize female comrades, asking them to calculate accounts, saying, "One child is equivalent to a middle peasant; two children are equivalent to a rich peasant; three children are equivalent to a landlord." The higher authorities stipulated that women cadres' children should receive an additional 45 kilograms of rice for childcare fees, but the Jingxing County government refused to implement this. Even after the county women's federation intervened, the issue remained unresolved (similar incidents in other counties also existed). The implementation of women's marriage policies is even more worthy of deep reflection. Due to the backward concept of "giving preference to sons over daughters," the focus is not on taking care of the interests of both men and women, but on emphasizing the male side, increasing the suffering of the female side. Therefore, in the past two months, there have been 13 cases of female suicide in six counties, including 10 cases due to dissatisfaction with marriage, one case due to abuse, and two cases due to husbands' improper behavior in male-female relationships. The county party committees did not promptly grasp and carry out ideological struggles against the above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and violations of policies, allowing them to flow freely. The idea of "giving preference to sons over daughters" exists in varying degrees in some party committees. Regarding how to strengthen women's work in the future, the prefectural committee pointed out: (1) Open up the minds of party members and correct erroneous views; (2) Strengthen leadership; (3) Cultivate, promote, and use women cadres. He said: The situation is developing so rapidly that more young and middle-aged men are needed to join the army and support the war, and more cadres are needed to go south to work. It is impossible to do the work in the rear and old areas without women. Therefore, the Party must emphasize leadership over women's work, and the entire Party must do women's work. The Party Committee should regularly study and instruct women's work, making it an important item in the Party's deployment and inspection of work; deeply publicize and correctly implement marriage policies to reduce women's suffering and the occurrence of problems. Some rural branches in Quyang have established women's committees to lead women's work. This organizational form can be tried out.
　　Finally, the Party must earnestly pay attention to the cultivation, promotion, and use of women cadres: they should be cultivated through various levels of representative meetings; various schools and training classes should absorb more women students; strengthen the policy and theoretical learning of in-service women cadres, and give them more opportunities to participate in meetings in order to improve their awareness; those who meet the conditions can participate in the party committee at the same level. Regarding the issue of children, the Party's policy is to reward childbirth and childcare, and to oppose abortion and neglect of children. The leadership should provide care for cadres with children. Of course, it is also necessary to be vigilant and pay attention to overcoming the problem of women cadres themselves only caring about children, not caring about work, being concerned about status, not studying hard, and having poor motivation.

　　北岳四地委号召干部
  　克服重男轻女思想注意培养妇女干部
    【本报讯】为加强妇女工作，四分区最近召开了各县妇女干部会。会上，地委负责同志就目前思想上、组织上重男轻女，及今后如何加强妇女工作，作了重要发言。首先对“重男轻女”的封建落后思想严格揭发说：在不少党员干部中，还存在这种落后观点：从组织上看，我们没注意提拔妇女干部，没有把一切有能力的妇女干部适当配备到各个部门中去。全分区党、政、民干部中，妇女干部仅占男干部的百分之十点八。从思想上看：有的同志轻视劳动妇女，片面地强调文化，写不来报告的女干部就不要，谈到把妇女干部配备到政府各部门去，平山县政府秘书就坚决反对，还说：“搞那干什么？这样把我的孩子老婆也弄来，不能工作还不会吃饭？”阜平县委的个别同志和政府财政科，更经常讽刺女同志，叫女干部算算帐，“生小孩一个即成为中农；两个即成为富农；三个即成为地主了”。上级规定妇女干部的幼儿增加四十五斤米的褓姆费，井陉县政府竟拒绝不执行，经县妇联交涉，仍不解决（其他各县的类似事情，也同样存在）。在执行妇女婚姻政策上，更值得深刻检讨，由于“重男轻女”的落后观点作怪，不是照顾男女双方的利益，而是强调男子一方，增加妇女一方的痛苦，因此，在最近两月内，六个县中发生妇女自杀事件十三起，其中因对婚姻不满者十件，因受虐待者一件，因丈夫在男女关系上不正派两件。对以上错误思想和违犯政策的行为，各县党委没有及时抓紧开展思想斗争，任其自流，“重男轻女”的思想，在某些党委中或多或少地存在。对今后如何加强妇女工作，地委指出：（一）要打通党员思想，纠正错误观点；（二）加强领导；（三）培养、提拔、使用妇女干部。他说：形势发展这样快，还需要更多的青壮年男子去参军和支援战争，需要更多的干部南下去工作，后方和老区的工作，没有妇女来作是不行的。因此，党必须强调对妇女工作的领导，必须全党来做妇女工作，党委应经常研究与指示妇女工作，作为党内布置检查工作的重要一项；深入宣传和正确执行婚姻政策，以减少妇女的痛苦和问题的发生。曲阳有些农村支部，设妇女委员领导妇女工作，这种组织形式可以试办。
    最后，党要切实注意妇女干部的培养、提拔和使用：要通过各级代表会来培养她们；各种学校训练班中，应多吸收妇女学员；加强在职妇女干部的政策、理论学习，多给她们参加会议的机会，以便提高她们的觉悟；够条件的可参加同级党委。关于小孩问题，党的方针是奖励生小孩和带小孩，反对打胎和不爱护小孩，领导上对带孩子的干部应加照顾。当然，妇女干部本身只顾孩子，不管工作，计较地位高低，不努力学习，进取心差，这些也必须警惕和注意克服。
