To the Editor:

I am a middle school student. In our school, many students receive publicly funded treatment, but because of different family circumstances, the extent of the treatment varies. I don't understand this very well. Does the government have a "Student Publicly Funded Treatment Method" regulation? Please investigate on our behalf, and it would be best if you could publicly answer in the newspaper.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Li Gengsheng

Comrade Gengsheng:

Based on your inquiry, we are publishing the "Provisional Standards for Publicly Funded Treatment of Middle and Normal School Students" formulated by the government below.

Provisional Standards for Publicly Funded Treatment of Middle and Normal School Students

Article 1: Normal school students are generally provided with food. Middle school students are basically required to pay their own expenses, that is, food, clothing, textbooks, and stationery are entirely self-provided.

Article 2: Any normal or middle school student who meets one of the following conditions may receive full publicly funded treatment, and all expenses for food, clothing, textbooks, stationery, etc., shall be provided by the school:

　　(1) Children of martyrs who are from poor families and unable to attend school.

　　(2) Children of supply-system cadres whose families are outside the North China Liberated Area, or who are of local origin but have severed economic ties with their families.

　　(3) Those from families with particularly difficult financial circumstances and with particularly excellent academic performance.

Article 3: Middle school students who do not meet the conditions for full public funding but are unable to fully pay their own expenses may receive a subsidy for part or all of their food, depending on their circumstances. Those with excellent academic performance may also be given a discretionary subsidy for part of their textbooks, stationery, and clothing expenses. Children of military and industrial personnel (teachers and staff of all levels of schools and cadres separated from production are treated the same) shall have priority for this type of public funding subsidy.

Article 4: Middle school students who can commute to school shall pay their own expenses, except for those who meet the provisions of Article 2.

Article 5: Youths from the KMT-controlled areas who come to this area to study and are introduced to the school with the approval of the administrative office level government or above may enjoy the public funding treatment of Articles 1 to 3.

Article 6: The quota for publicly funded students (calculated on the basis of full public funding) is budgeted at 70% of the total number of students in normal schools. In general middle schools, it is budgeted at 50% of the total number of students. In middle schools in large and medium-sized cities, it is budgeted at 30%. Each full publicly funded student is calculated at 110 jin of rice per month, and is managed and used in a unified manner.

Article 7: The total quota of publicly funded students in middle and normal schools in various places shall be determined and distributed by the North China People's Government before the beginning of each year.

Article 8: These provisional standards only apply to middle and normal schools that are paid for by North China funds.

Article 9: These provisional standards shall be implemented from January of the 38th year of the Republic of China [1949].
