　　Soviet Culture Collection
    △ In 1948, the Soviet "Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge" organized more than 60,000 public academic lectures on international, economic, historical, technical, agricultural, philosophical, literary, artistic, medical, and biological issues. More than 10 million people attended these lectures. The society distributed 200 kinds of popular pamphlets, totaling 30 million copies. The society also united a large number of intellectuals to popularize political and scientific knowledge in factories. The Moscow branch of the association did the best in this regard. There are twenty or thirty lectures in Moscow every day. Collective farms in the Urals have academic lecture halls, and scientists from Moscow go there every week to give academic lectures. The various member republics have also done a lot of work in promoting political and scientific knowledge. All states of the Ukrainian Republic have branches and have built about 500 lecture halls so that scientists can give public academic lectures to workers and farmers. The Turkmen Republic has hosted more than 800 academic lectures in eight months, with approximately 200,000 listeners.
    △ In 1948, the Soviet Trade Union allocated 100 million rubles to disseminate knowledge of culture, science, and technology among the working people through lectures, reports, books, films, consultations, and exhibitions. The number of workers and staff who use their spare time to engage in planned study to improve their technical knowledge and general cultural level has doubled in the post-war years.
    △ The cultural and educational network in the Soviet countryside is constantly growing. In 1948, there were nearly 150,000 rural clubs and libraries, and more than 4,000 "district-level cultural centers." In the rural areas of the Russian Federation alone, there are about 6,000 rural theaters. Collective farms in the Moscow region alone have more than 1,000 film projectors. Last year, the Russian Federation established many new cultural institutions, whose mission is to spread progressive ideas and meet the diverse cultural needs of collective farmers.
    △ This year, the Soviet Union will hold a contemporary drama review, in which all Soviet theaters will participate. There are more than 400 large theaters in the Soviet Union, performing plays in 50 languages of the Soviet nationalities. Dramas depicting Soviet life are the most prominent in the programs of these theaters. For the sake of the review, the theaters will stage new dramas, and the best scripts will be performed in Moscow. After the review, a national conference of theater managers and playwrights will be held.
    △ In 1948, the Soviet Union's production of radio receivers exceeded more than three times the pre-war level. This year, the output of radio receivers will exceed seven times the pre-war level. Soviet collective farm peasants installed a large number of radio receivers in 1948. Collective farmers in the Kazakh Republic alone installed 6,000 radio receivers. The Izvestia pointed out: This is a matter of great importance in the country. The newspaper called on every collective farmer's family to install a radio receiver.
    △ In 1948, the Soviet radio industry began large-scale production of new-style portable television lines. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that television programs should be broadcast not only in Moscow and Leningrad, but also in major Soviet cities. Preparations are underway to achieve this goal. Various clubs in dozens of towns have opened many amateur television personnel training courses. After the start of television broadcasting, residents of these cities will be able to watch the programs on television sets, just like watching movies.
    △ Figures released by the Soviet Publishing Bureau at the beginning of the year stated that since 1917, the Soviet Union has published 754 million copies of Marxist-Leninist works. The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have been published in 110 languages (including 22 languages of Soviet nationalities). Lenin's works have been published in 77 languages in 174 million copies. (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th)

　　苏联文化集锦
    △一九四八年一年中，苏联“政治与科学知识普及协会”一共主办了六万多次关于国际、经济、历史、技术、农业、哲学、文学、艺术、医药与生物学等各种问题的公开学术演讲。听讲者有一千多万人。该协会在一年当中共散发了两百种通俗化的小册子，总数共三千万册。该协会并团结了大批知识分子，将政治与科学知识普及到工厂里去。在这方面以该协会的莫斯科分会做得最好。莫斯科每天都有二三十种演讲。乌拉尔各地的集体农场都设有学术讲演厅，莫斯科的科学家们每星期都到那里去作学术讲演。各加盟共和国也做了许多推广政治与科学知识的工作。乌克兰共和国所有的州都设有分会，已建筑了约五百座讲演厅，以便科学家对工人及农民们作公开学术讲演。土库曼共和国在八个月内曾主办了八百多次学术讲演，听讲者约二十万人。
    △一九四八年，苏联职工会共拨款一亿卢布，通过演讲、报告、图书、电影、咨询、展览等方式，在劳动人民中散播文化科学和技术方面的知识。利用业余时间进行有计划的学习，以增进技术知识并提高一般文化水准的工人和职员的数目，在战后数年内已增加了一倍。
    △苏联农村中的文化教育网正在不断增长。一九四八年，共有将近十五万所农村俱乐部及图书馆、四千多所“区立文化之家”。只在俄罗斯联邦的农村中，便约有六千所农村剧院。仅莫斯科州的集体农场，就有电影放映机一千多架。去年，俄罗斯联邦建立了许多新文化机关，它们的任务都是传播进步思想并满足集体农民多方面的文化需要。
    △今年，苏联将举行当代戏剧评判会，苏联各剧院都将参加。苏联现有四百余家大剧院，以苏联各民族的五十种语言演剧。描写苏联生活的戏剧在这些剧院的节目中最为突出。为举行评判起见，各剧院将上演新剧，最好的剧本将在莫斯科演出。评判会后，将举行全苏剧院经理及剧作家大会。
    △一九四八年苏联无线电收音机的生产数量超过战前水平的三倍多。今年无线电收音机的产量将超出战前水平的七倍。苏联集体农场农民在一九四八年大量地装设无线电收音机，仅哈萨克共和国的集体农民，就装设了六千架收音机。消息报指出：这是一件在全国有巨大重要性的事情。该报号召每一个集体农民的家庭都装设一架收音机。
    △一九四八年，苏维埃无线电工业开始大规模生产新式的轻便电视线。五年计划规定：电视播送节目不仅要在莫斯科、列宁格勒播送，而且要在苏联各大城市播送。为了实现这个目的，准备工作正在进行中。数十个城镇的各种俱乐部，已开办了许多业余电视人员训练班。在电视播送开始以后，这些城市的居民们就可以用电视机收看播送的节目，和看电影一样。
    △苏联出版局年初发表的数字称，从一九一七年以来，苏联已出版马克思——列宁主义著作七亿五千四百万册。马、恩、列、斯的著作用一百一十种语文（其中包括苏联各民族的二十二种语文）出版。列宁的著作用七十七种语文出版了一亿七千四百万册。（新华社陕北十一日电）
