【Taihang News】Yushe County, in preparation for launching spring propaganda and entertainment, convened a county-wide rural drama troupe meeting on December 16th. Seventy-two people attended, including heads and editors from various village troupes. The meeting reviewed past work, exchanged experiences, and resolved a series of issues related to organizational leadership, actor education, and creative direction. Regarding old dramas in Shecheng, everyone clarified that they are products of feudal society, serving the ruling class, and determined that old dramas should be performed critically, transforming them. Those that are greatly harmful should not be performed; those that are slightly harmful but have great benefits should be transformed. At the same time, the new policy of self-written, self-performed, self-entertained, and self-sung was thoroughly implemented, criticizing the past erroneous practice of exclusively performing large dramas, being extravagant and wasteful. It was decided that in the future, troupes should perform whatever they can, based on the conditions of the village, whether it be Yangge, Flower Opera, or plaza drama, as long as it can promote propaganda. It was also decided that reports should be made every ten days, with the county People's Education Center providing regular leadership, timely exchanging experiences to promote the work of various villages.

【Taihang News】The Ping Shun Education Section convened a meeting of district assistants and central principals on the 20th of last month. In addition to discussing winter school work, a plan for preparing entertainment for the Lunar New Year was drawn up: 1. Teachers in each village (including winter school volunteer teachers) should organize rural artists or those who are good at entertainment to write operas, rhythmic stories, ditties, drum books, etc. 2. Combine winter school with collecting typical deeds of model military families, participation in the army, participation in the war, supporting the front, and farming on behalf of others, and compile them in a timely manner. 3. In addition to self-compiled and approved performances, each village can also incorporate new short plays published in the newspaper or those from the county. 4. Start immediately. Take advantage of the snow gaps to rehearse. 5. Entertainment should be carried out in each village before the tenth day of the lunar new year, and entertainment competitions will be held in all districts on the tenth day. Model selections will be made from each district on the Lantern Festival, and then competitions will be held throughout the county. Awards will be given immediately after the selection of models. At the end of the meeting, everyone was determined to do a good job in winter school and New Year's entertainment, so that the masses can become more active in the face of this great victory.
