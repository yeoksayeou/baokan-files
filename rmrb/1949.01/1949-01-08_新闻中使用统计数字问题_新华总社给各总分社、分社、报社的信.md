On the Issue of Using Statistics in News Reports
Xinhua News Agency Headquarters to All General Branches, Branches, and Newspapers

There are quite a few shortcomings in our use of statistical figures in news reports. Some have been pointed out or corrected on our behalf many times, but the same mistakes are still being made, and universal and continuous attention has not been drawn to them. We hereby solemnly raise this issue again, hoping to improve it together.

For example: In the November 19th稿 (gao, contribution/manuscript) from the Northeast concerning education in Shenyang, there are statements such as "59 universities, middle schools, and primary schools have resumed classes one after another, with more than 9,000 students attending, and most of the 1,000+ old teachers and staff continue to be employed." This kind of vague and general statistical figure that does not distinguish between universities, middle schools, and primary schools is of little use and is unreasonable. It does not show how many universities and specialized schools there are, what their names are, what their nature and scale are, how many middle schools there are, and how many students there are in universities and middle schools.

Another example: The November 26th 稿 from North China reports on the complete repair and opening of the Yangde Railway, which states, "Historically, the Kuomintang repaired one kilometer of road per day; the Japanese used machines to repair three to four kilometers per day; and the People's Government repaired the Yangde Road, creating a new record of repairing four kilometers and 300 meters per day." This kind of comparative figure lacking necessary explanations is of unclear significance. Because it does not explain whether the Kuomintang and Japanese road repairs were "repairs" or new constructions; nor does it explain whether the three used the same amount of manpower and material resources for repair or construction on the same terrain; nor does it explain whether the so-called repairing several kilometers a day is the highest record or the average performance. If these conditions are not clearly explained, this comparison is incomprehensible.

Another example: In reports from various places on urban industry and commerce, there are often statements such as "During the enemy and puppet period (or when occupied by the enemy), there were only a few industrial and commercial establishments, but after liberation, they have developed to a certain number." Here, firstly, it is not stated what year the so-called "enemy and puppet period" or "when occupied by the enemy" and "after liberation" refers to (there can be a big difference each year). Secondly, industry and commerce, production and non-production, are not separated, let alone distinguishing between different industries, machine factories and handicraft workshops, shops and street vendors, etc. Because there is no classified explanation, it is impossible to judge whether there is indeed "development" and in what direction "development" is taking place. If several factories close down and dozens of shops increase, according to the above statistical method, it can be said that the number of industrial and commercial households has increased tenfold, but in reality, it is a decline in production.

The above examples belong to the category of unclear figures. In addition, some figures are completely wrong. Some do not distinguish between percentages and multiples, such as saying that a price reduction of 50 percent is described as "reduced by one time." This statement is incomprehensible. Because the original price itself is one time, saying it is reduced by one time compared to it is equal to zero. If it is said to be reduced by several times or even dozens or hundreds of times, it becomes a negative number. Some do not distinguish between exceeding and equalling. If the number of factories increased from ten to twenty, it is said to have "increased by two times," but in reality, it should be said to have increased by one time, or increased to two times, or equal to two times the original number.

In addition, contradictions between previous and subsequent reports of the same thing or related figures in the same manuscript, or having numbers without units, or having units that can be interpreted in various ways (such as one 垧 (shang) can be three or ten mu, one 石 (dan) can be 100 or 300 jin, one ton can be an English ton or an American ton), or the unit is incomprehensible to the average reader (purely local or highly specialized), and using different classifications, different standards, and different units in statistics and comparisons, resulting in completely wrong statistical and comparison results, are also common occurrences.

Examples of the above-mentioned unclear or completely wrong figures are too numerous to list. This has become one of the common problems in our news writing (and in other writing as well). This problem not only appears in local newspapers, but is also commonly seen in our broadcasts. Due to the existence of these problems, the adoption of the entire manuscript is often affected, or the timeliness is lost due to inquiries back and forth, or the Chinese broadcast is reluctantly used, but the foreign language broadcast cannot be translated. Even if it is used carelessly, there will be no good results. Because some of these figures are the same as saying nothing, and some are worse than saying nothing. Readers cannot get anything from it, and may therefore have various misunderstandings, and may even doubt the authenticity of the entire news because of suspicion of these figures.

In our news (and elsewhere), the purpose of using figures is not for superficial decoration and piling up, but to accurately explain the problem through it. Therefore, when conducting surveys and statistics and using statistical figures, it is necessary to make various necessary and appropriate classifications and analysis explanations, and it is necessary to strive for accuracy. For important specialized statistical figures that cannot be directly obtained by general news reporters and news organizations themselves under normal circumstances, the source or basis must be indicated as much as possible when quoting them, such as saying that according to the statistics of a certain agency or person at a certain time, or stating that it is quoted from what kind of books and periodicals published at what time and place. Only in this way can we be truthful and responsible to the people on this issue, not writing nonsense. Lenin's wife said in the book "Learn the Working Methods from Lenin": "Carefully checking every fact and every number is a method that Lenin always used. When it comes to numbers with great significance and great weight, he even checks the totals of published numerical tables." We must implement Lenin's serious and meticulous work style in our news agency and newspaper work.

### 新闻中使用统计数字问题　新华总社给各总分社、分社、报社的信

　　新闻中使用统计数字问题
  　新华总社给各总分社、分社、报社的信
    我们新闻中在使用统计数字时，存在着不少的缺点。有的曾经多次地指出过或代为改正过，但仍是一犯再犯，并未能引起普遍而经常的注意。兹特再一次郑重提出，希望共谋改进。
    例如：东北十一月十九日来稿关于沈阳教育的报导中，有“大、中、小学已有五十九所先后复课，到校学生已达九千余人，千余旧教职员大部继续留用”等语。这种大、中、小学不分的含混笼统的统计数字，是很少用处并不合理的。其中究竟有几所大学及专门学校、叫什么名称，其性质规模如何，有多少中等学校，高等学校与中等学校各有多少学生等等，均看不出来。
    又如：华北十一月二十六日来稿报导阳德铁路全线修复通车，其中有“在历史上，国民党修路是一天一公里；日本人用机器一天修三至四公里；而人民政府修建阳德路，却创造了一天修四公里又三百米的新纪录”等语。这种缺乏必要说明的比较数字，是意义不明显的。因为既没有说明国民党与日本人修路是“修复”，还是从新修建；也没有说明三者是否在同样的地形上使用同样多的人力、物力从事复修或修建；又没有说明所谓一天修几里，究竟是最高纪录还是平均成绩。如果不把这些条件交代清楚，这个比较，便不可理解。
    又如：各地来稿关于城市工商业的报导中，常有“敌伪时期（或敌占时）仅有工商业若干家，解放以后已发展到若干家”一类的话。在这里，第一、所谓“敌伪时期”或“敌占时”与“解放后”究指何年（每年差别可以很大），是没有交代的。第二、工业与商业，生产事业与非生产事业是没有分开的，更不要说是分别行业、分别机器工厂与手工作坊，分别商店与摊贩等等。由于没有分类说明，究竟是否“发展”，向什么方向“发展”，也就无从判断了。如果倒闭几家工厂而增加了几十家商店，按上述统计法，可说是工商业户增加了十倍，实际上却是生产的衰落。
    上述所举，是属于不明了的一类。此外，有些数字，则是完全错误的。有的是百分数与倍数不分，如把物价降低了百分之五十说作“降低了一倍”。这种说法是不通的。因为原价本身是一倍，说比它降低一倍。那就是等于零了。如说降低数倍乃至数十倍、数百倍就变成负数了。有的是超过数与相等数不分，如果把工厂数由十家增至二十家说作“增加二倍”，实则应说增加一倍、或增至两倍，或等于原数的两倍。
    此外对同一事物的前后报导数字或在同一稿件中相关数字的相互矛盾，或有数字而无单位，或有单位而可作各种解释（如一垧可以是三亩或十亩，一石可以是百斤或三百斤，一吨可以是英吨或美吨）或该单位为普通读者所不解（纯地方性的或极专门的），以及在统计与比较时用了不同的分类，不同的标准和不同的单位，以致统计与比较的结果完全错误，也是常见的事。
    象上述这类数字含混不清或完全错误的例子，不胜列举。这已经成了我们新闻写作中（其实也存在于其他写作中）的通病之一。这种毛病不只是出现于各地报纸上，同样也常见于我们的广播中。由于这些毛病的存在，往往影响整篇稿件的采用，或因往返查询而失去时效，或者是中文广播勉强用了，而外文广播则无法翻译，即令马虎用出，也不会有好结果。因为这些数字，有的是说了等于不说，有的是说了比不说还坏。读者不能从它得到什么，并可能因此发生各种误解，甚至会因怀疑这种数字而怀疑到整篇新闻的真实性。
    我们在新闻中（在别的地方也是一样）。运用数字的目的，不在于表面的装饰和堆砌，而在于通过它来准确地说明问题。因此在进行调查统计与使用统计数字时，就必须作各种必要而适当的分类与分析说明，就必须力求其正确无误。对于在通常情况下非一般新闻记者与新闻机关本身所能直接获得的带专门性的重要统计数字，在引用时还须尽量注明其来源或何所根据，如说据某某机关或某某人在何时的统计，或载明引自何时何地出版的何种书报刊物等。只有这样，才算是在这个问题上，不是信中雌黄，而是实事求是，郑重其事，对人民负责。列宁夫人在“向列宁学习工作方法”一书中说：“仔细地检查每一事实，每一数字，是列宁始终采用的方法。当涉及有巨大意义和巨大比重的数字时，他连已公布的数字表的总计也加以检查。”我们必须把列宁的这种严肃精细的作风贯彻到我们的通讯社和报社工作中来。
