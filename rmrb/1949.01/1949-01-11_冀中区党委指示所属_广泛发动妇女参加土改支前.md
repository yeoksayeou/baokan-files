【Jizhong Electric】The Jizhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to further and widely mobilize women to actively participate in and complete the concluding land reform and support-the-front work, issued instructions to party committees at all levels on December 20th. The instructions pointed out that the concluding land reform must be completed before the Lunar New Year, otherwise it will delay spring production. The battle to liberate Tianjin and Beijing is now underway, and a large number of young people are going to the front lines to support the war. In order to ensure the successful completion of the concluding land reform and the support-the-front work, it is necessary to further mobilize women to participate in the concluding land reform and the rear support-the-front movement. The instructions emphasized the need to first raise the fighting spirit of the broad masses of women, enlighten their awareness of serving the victory of the war in everything, and implement the mobilization of their husbands and sons to enthusiastically participate in various support-the-front work, and oppose dragging their feet. They should be organized in a planned way for sewing, washing, comforting, treating the wounded, and milling grain to ensure wartime supply. At the same time, women should be educated to recognize that this battle is taking place in winter, and that troops and militiamen are marching to the front lines, so they should warmly love the troops and militiamen, and provide them with convenient food and lodging, so that they can eat their fill and stay warm, actively participate in the war, and victoriously annihilate the enemy. In addition, the work of concluding land reform, issuing land certificates, compensating middle peasants, distributing houses, and distributing seized property should all be carried out with the wide and in-depth mobilization of women.
    At the same time, strengthen the leadership of party committees at all levels over women's work, and vigorously implement the party's policy on women's work.
    In short, the mobilization of women in general villages should focus on concluding land reform and supporting production for the front, while in flood-stricken villages, it should focus on production for disaster relief. Different villages should have different approaches, and should not be generalized. Experience has proven that women have made great achievements in concluding land reform, distributing seized property, propaganda, registration, land surveying, and in rear support-the-front work such as making military uniforms and shoes, milling grain, supporting military families, and replacing civilian laborers at the front for production. All localities must attach importance to mobilizing women's work.

　　冀中区党委指示所属
  　广泛发动妇女参加土改支前
    【冀中电】中共冀中区党委，为更进一步广泛发动妇女积极参加与完成结束土改和支前工作，在十二月二十日对各级党委发出指示。指出：结束土改必须于旧历年前完成，否则即误明春生产。现在解放平津战役正在开展，大批青年开赴前线支援战争，为使结束土改与支前工作胜利完成，必须进一步发动妇女投入结束土改与后方支前运动。指示中强调首先提高广大妇女群众的战斗思想，启发她们一切为战争胜利服务的自觉性，贯彻动员自己的丈夫儿子热烈参加各种支前工作，反对拉尾巴。应有计划的组织起来缝洗、慰问、救护伤员、碾米磨面，以保证战时供给。同时要教育妇女，认识到此次战役正是冬天，部队民兵远征前线，应热情的爱护部队民兵，切实的给他们以食宿方便，使其能吃的饱，住的暖，积极参战，胜利的歼灭敌人。另外结束土改、发土地证、补偿中农、分房子、分浮财等工作，都要广泛深入的发动起妇女来做。
    同时加强各级党委对妇女的领导，大力贯彻全党做妇女工作的方针。
    总之，一般村发动妇女，应以结束土改与生产支前为主要内容，水灾村则以生产救灾为主，不同村庄应有不同作法，不应一般化。经验证明：妇女在结束土改、分配浮财、宣传、登记、丈量土地中，在后方支前工作做军衣、军鞋、碾米、优军、代替支前民工生产上，皆有极大成绩，各地对发动妇女工作，必须提起重视。
