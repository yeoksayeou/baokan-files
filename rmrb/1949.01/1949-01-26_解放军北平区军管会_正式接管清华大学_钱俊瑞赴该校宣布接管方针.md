Xinhua News Agency, Suburbs of Peiping, 24th—The Peiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army formally took over Tsinghua University on the 10th, receiving a warm welcome from the university's teachers and students. On the morning of the 10th, Qian Junrui, Director of the Cultural Takeover Committee of the Peiping Military Control Commission, and others, went to the university under orders to carry out the takeover work. At approximately 11:00 AM, a Tsinghua University Affairs Committee meeting was first convened. Attendees included Feng Youlan, acting chairman of the Tsinghua University Affairs Committee; Huo Bingquan, Dean of Studies; Shen Lu, Secretary-General; Chu Shi-chuan, Dean of Students; and department heads Ye Qisun, Chen Daisun, Shi Jiayang, and Tang Peisong. At the meeting, Comrade Qian Junrui explained the Military Control Commission's policy for taking over Tsinghua, roughly stating: First, Tsinghua University should implement New Democratic cultural education in the future, eliminating elements opposing the people from past education, and reforming aspects of past education that alienated the people. Second, the overall reform of education is a complex undertaking that must proceed step by step. All existing institutions and systems will temporarily remain unchanged, except for the immediate abolition of the Kuomintang's reactionary student guidance system and the immediate cessation of counter-revolutionary activities by Kuomintang members and Three Youth League members. The University Affairs Committee will immediately be responsible for confiscating firearms hidden by Kuomintang secret agents. Third, the Military Control Commission will be responsible for supplying school funding. Generally, teachers and staff will retain their original positions and salaries. In the future, employment and promotions will be based on merit and performance. At 2:00 PM, over 2,000 faculty, students, school workers, and security guards gathered in the auditorium to hear Comrade Qian Junrui announce the above policy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the People's Government for taking over Tsinghua University. When Comrade Qian Junrui said, "Today, Tsinghua University is liberated from the hands of the reactionaries and becomes a university of the people, marking a new era in Tsinghua's history. From now on, it will forever be a university of the Chinese people," the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. At 3:00 PM, the university held a faculty meeting. Attending professors included Pan Guangdan, Wu Jingchao, Qian Weichang, Zeng Bingjun, Chen Zhen, Gao Chongxi, Duan Xuefu, Liang Sicheng, Gu Peimu, Li Guangtian, Fei Xiaotong, and nearly one hundred others. At the meeting, Comrade Qian Junrui briefly introduced the construction of industry, agriculture, culture and education in the liberated areas and focused on explaining the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's emphasis on scientific and technological research, as well as the policy of guaranteeing the people's freedom of thought and belief. In the evening, a life committee meeting was convened, chaired by Professor Fei Xiaotong. Representatives from the professors' association, the teachers' union, staff, students, school workers, and security guards attended to discuss school funding and living issues. Attendees unanimously supported the plan to retain original positions and salaries.
