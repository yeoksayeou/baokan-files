　　Several Suggestions on Stabilizing Prices
    Just as our North China troops were surrounding Beiping and the People's Bank of China was issuing new currency, prices have soared in the past half month. Grain prices have nearly doubled, and some merchants in Shijiazhuang are scrambling to purchase materials for speculation, causing extreme instability in market prices and widespread public anxiety, which is impacting winter production. It is hoped that all economic departments will focus on the interests of the people and the development of production to stabilize prices. Here are a few suggestions:
    (1) Strictly manage the market. Those merchants who deliberately raise prices, manipulate speculation, and monopolize hoarding should be stopped and punished.
    (2) Public enterprises should release some materials through the market based on the needs of the people, overcoming the problem of only focusing on large transactions, which leads to speculation by merchants (through markets or cooperatives).
    (3) Economic committees at all levels should convene public enterprises and cooperative departments to conduct business inspections to determine if there are any practices that contribute to price increases, reduce purchases, and unify efforts to stabilize prices.
    (4) Bank loans should strive to be issued in kind (rice and wheat) to promote the expansion of lending in kind (this can resolve the contradiction between tightening currency and supporting people's production).
    (5) In the event of price instability, the bank can recover overdrafts from industries, stop some unnecessary commercial loans, recover loans that are due, and appropriately stop or reduce withdrawals from deposit accounts.
    (6) Inspect the collection of industrial and commercial taxes and the income from transaction fees, remit the full amount to the treasury on schedule, and promptly clear any outstanding consolidated cumulative tax payments.

　　对稳定物价的几点意见
    正当华北我军包围北平和中国人民银行新币发行之际，近半月来物价猛涨；粮食上涨将达一倍，石门有些商贩到各地争购物资投机，市场物价极度不稳，人心惶惶，冬季生产受到打击，希望各经济部门从人民利益和发展生产着眼稳定物价，兹特提供几点意见：
    （一）严格管理市场，对于故意抬高市价操纵投机垄断囤积之商贩，应予制止和制裁。
    （二）各公营企业应根据人民之需要，通过市场抛出部分物资，克服只顾大宗交易，致商贩投机的毛病（通过市场或合作社）。
    （三）各级经委会应召集公营企业合作部门进行业务检查，是否有助长物价上涨的毛病，减少购货，统一力量进行平抑。
    （四）银行放款争取以实物贷出（米麦），推动贷实的开展（这样紧缩通货与扶助人民生产的矛盾可以解决）。
    （五）在物价不稳之情况下，银行可收回行业透支部分，停止一部不必要之商业放款，收回到期贷款，适当的停止或减少存款户的支取。
    （六）工商税收款项检查交易费收入，如数按期解交金库，迅速清理尾欠统累税款。
