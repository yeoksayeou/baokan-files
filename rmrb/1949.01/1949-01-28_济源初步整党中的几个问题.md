Several Problems in the Preliminary Party Rectification in Jiyuan
	Taiyue Branch of Xinhua News Agency
	The first phase of preliminary party rectification in Jiyuan, covering thirty-eight key villages, has concluded and achieved some results. For example, some behaviors of sheltering landlords and rich peasants, and stealing fruits of the revolution, infringing upon the interests of the people were identified, indicating that impure ideological styles are very serious. Impure elements are isolated cases (only one rich peasant has been identified so far). During the preliminary party rectification, the awareness of party members has been raised a step further, and they have begun to identify some serious behaviors that infringe upon the interests of the people. At the public branch meetings, some have admitted their mistakes to the masses and stipulated measures for correction in the future. The relationship between the branch and the masses has begun to improve. However, from the process of preliminary party rectification in Jiyuan, some issues are worth studying.
	(1) The vast majority of party members lack strict procedures for joining the party, slack organizational life after joining the party, poor criticism and self-criticism, and very little basic knowledge of the party. The general level of awareness of party members is not high, and some are very low. Some party members say: "Once I joined the party, I'm set for life!" Some even regard the party as riding on the people's backs, with special powers. Therefore, when they heard about the party rectification, they felt "cheated!" On the other hand, they feel they have contributed to the revolution and believe the masses are ungrateful, which generates resistance to the party rectification in their minds. A party member from Nan Yao Village said: "The more actively we work, the more the masses oppose us." The working comrades simply believe that they are "unconscious" and that "party members are full of grievances and are complaining to the party." It is easy to forgive and accommodate them. Some working comrades became clearer later. In Nan Yao Village, starting from the current level of awareness of party members, they explained the conditions of a communist party member, the party's service to the masses, and the purpose and direction of this party rectification in connection with specific materials. Then they asked: "Is it right for communist party members to complain that the masses are against us? Why don't the masses support us and oppose us when we have contributed to the revolution?" This enlightened the party members' ideological awareness. Some thought about the many things they had done to infringe upon the interests of the people and couldn't sleep all night. Wang Bingding, who originally complained the most about the masses being ungrateful, also examined his mistakes at the meeting the next day. Thus, the examination of the work of the branch was unfolded, such as: anti-traitor liquidation, major review, military service, correction of deviations, and militia work. The more they checked, the more serious they found the problems. In the militia work, from the time the enemy retreated in 1947 to before the correction of deviations, twenty-seven households were fined under various pretexts, of which only one was a rich peasant, and the remaining twenty-six were middle and poor peasants. A total of ninety-two bolts of cloth, 246,000 yuan, 1.7 dou of grain, and 30 jin of tofu were wasted by the militia. However, this examination was not profound. It only presented some materials, but did not examine from what standpoint these things were done. Some villages did even worse. In Xi Liuxiang Village, when a party member pointed out that the village chief's accounts were unclear, the village chief wanted to resign, and the branch secretary quickly comforted him. Some working comrades simply thought that such a resolutely resistant party member was not actively speaking. Such a party rectification is bound to fail. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to carry out party rectification from the current level of awareness of party members, and to oppose "unconscious" coercion or accommodation. But on the other hand, once major problems, especially matters of principle, are revealed, it is necessary to guide party members to conduct a more in-depth examination, so that they can correctly and profoundly understand the nature and causes of their mistakes and then correct them.
	(2) Some comrades who lead the party rectification work have not truly accepted the spirit of the district party committee's purpose and policy of the party rectification. In the content of the examination, they failed to grasp the key points, and major issues of principle were glossed over lightly, but they put their efforts into lifestyle issues such as male-female relationships. For example, in the sixth district's Sanjiao Village branch, when the Red Spear Society rioted in 1946, all twenty-four party members, except one who was sick and three female party members, surrendered to the enemy. The branch secretary, the organizer Lu Yingxiong, and the propagandist Wang Taixian were in contact with secret agents before the riot. Later, Lu Yingxiong and Wang Taixian were expelled from the party, and Zhao Guoxin was placed on probation within the party. Three months later, he became the branch propagandist and village chief again. In this preliminary party rectification, Zhao Guoxin not only did not deeply examine his mistakes, but also made some anti-party remarks, such as saying: "Party members are the Eighth Route Army's telephone," and "The Communist Party is a rubber ball that cannot be softened." At that time, the working comrades thought: These are all things of the past! Just mentioning them is enough. However, when it came to checking the male-female relationship of female party members, they checked it with great interest for a long time. This cannot raise the awareness of party members a step further, and the party rectification will not yield great gains.
	(3) Some comrades who lead the party rectification work also hold a wrong "optimistic attitude" towards the branch, and do not proceed from the actual situation of the branch. They simply believe that this branch does not have much problems based on the composition of the party members. For example, after the working comrades in the seventh district's Wu Yan Village learned that among the village's twenty-eight party members, there were: thirteen poor peasants, four tenant farmers, five hired laborers, and four middle peasants; and among the five branch committee members, only one was a middle peasant, and four were poor peasants, they felt that this branch "has nothing wrong." However, after the work went deeper, they discovered that many party members with good backgrounds also sheltered landlords and even committed illegal acts. Last year, the masses calculated that the rich peasant Kong Xianwen owed 30 shi of grain and 6 mu of good land. Kong Xianwen consulted with the village cadre Zhao Jiazhen and reduced it by 15 shi, and also replaced the 6 mu of good land with bad land. Before the party rectification, party members Huang Xidao and Cui Guangde continued to steal to the landlord's house to play cards and eat meat, and also privately distributed the fruits of the masses' struggle to two landlord families. A total of seven party members had sheltered landlords and rich peasants, so the elimination of feudalism was not thorough. The landlords and rich peasants who had been struggled against still had an average of 3 mu of good land per person, while the poor peasants were divided some bad land, with the most averaging only 2.5 mu per person. This experience tells us that party rectification is an in-depth and meticulous work that requires in-depth investigation, research, and analysis of various situations, and cannot be based simply on composition or numbers.

　　济源初步整党中的几个问题
    太岳分社
    济源第一期进行初步整党的三十八个基点村，已经结束，获得了一些成绩。如：检查出一些包庇地富，窃取果实等侵犯人民利益的行为，说明思想作风不纯是很严重的；成份不纯是个别的（已知道的有一个富农）。在初步整党当中，党员的觉悟程度提高了一步，开始把一些严重侵犯人民利益的行为检查出来了。在公开支部的大会上，有些又向群众承认了错误，规定了今后纠正的办法。支部和群众的关系开始有了改进；可是从济源初步整党的过程中，可以看到有些问题是值得研究的。
    （一）绝大部分党员因为入党手续不严格，入党以后组织生活松懈，批评和自我批评与党的基本知识教育都很差；党员的觉悟程度一般的不高，有些还很低。象有的党员说：“我入了党就算坐上了萝卜啦！”更有些把党看成是骑在人民头上，有特殊权力的。因此，要整党了，他们感到“上了当了！”另一方面，也就觉得自己有功劳；认为群众没良心，在思想上产生了反对整党的抵抗情绪。南姚村党员说：“工作越积极群众越反对”。工作同志还简单的认为是：“不自觉的”，是“党员满肚子冤枉，向党来诉诉苦的”。就容易对，他们原谅，迁就。有些工作同志后来比较明确了。象南姚村，从党员现有觉悟程度出发，联系具体材料讲了什么是共产党员的条件，党是为群众服务的，与这次整党的目的和方针；然后又提出：“共产党员埋怨群众对不对？咱们有了功，为啥群众不拥护还反对咱？”启发了党员的思想觉悟；有的想到了自己侵犯人民利益的很多事，一夜没有睡着觉。王丙丁本来是最埋怨群众没良心的，在第二天会上，也检讨了自己的错误，这样就展开了对支部工作的检查，如：反奸清算、大复查、参军、纠偏、民兵工作等，越检查越觉得问题严重。象在民兵工作上，从民国三十六年敌人退走以后到纠偏以前，就借故罚了二十七户，其中只有一户是富农，其余二十六户是中贫农，一共罚九十二匹布、二十四万六千块钱、一石七斗粮食、三十斤豆腐，都叫民兵浪费了。但这种检查还是不深刻的，只是摆了些材料，究竟是从什么立场出发去做的？未检查出来。有些村做得更差，如西留响村，有个党员提出村长帐目不清，村长就要辞职，支书害怕赶快安慰了他一顿。对这样坚决抵抗的党员，有些工作同志，仅仅认为是发言不积极。这样的整党，必然要失败的。因此，一方面必须从党员现在的觉悟基础上，去进行整党，反对“不自觉”而硬逼或迁就；但另一方面，重要问题尤其原则问题一露出头后，就要诱导党员进行更深入的检查，让他们正确地、深刻地认识自己错误的性质、原因进而改正。
    （二）有些领导整党工作的同志，没有真正接受了区党委对整党目的和方针的精神。在检查内容上抓不住重点，重大的原则立场问题轻轻的滑过去了；但却把力量放在男女关系等生活问题上。象六区三教村支部，在民国三十五年红枪会暴动的时候，一共二十四个党员，除一个害病的和三个女党员以外，都投降了敌人。当时的支书、组织卢应熊、宣传王太仙在没有暴动以前，就和特务有联系。后来卢应熊、王太仙被开除党籍，赵国新留党查看，三个月以后又当了支部宣传和村长。在这次初步整党的检查中，赵国新不光是没有深刻检讨自己的错误，还发表了一些反党的言论；如说：“党员是八路军的电话筒”，“共产党是打不软的皮球”。当时工作同志认为：这些都是过去的事啦！提一提就算了。可是，当检查到女党员男女关系时，就很有兴趣的检查了半天。这样不能把党员觉悟提高一步，整党也不会得到大的收获。
    （三）还有些领导整党工作的同志，对支部抱着错误的“乐观态度”，不从支部的实际情况出发，只简单从党员的成份出发，就认为这个支部没多大问题。象七区吴彦村工作同志下去以后，在了解该村的二十八个党员里有：十三个贫农、四个佃农、五个雇工、四个中农；五个支委里，只有一个是中农，四个都是贫农后，就觉着这个支部“没有啥”。可是在工作深入了以后，才发现了不少成份好的党员，还包庇地主，甚至做出犯法的事。去年群众把富农孔献文算了三十石粮食，六亩好地；孔献文和村干部赵家斟一商量就减去了十五石，还把六亩好地也换成了坏地。党员黄西道、崔光德在整党以前，还不断偷到地主家里打牌、吃肉，还私自把群众的斗争果实分给两家地主，一共有七个党员都包庇过地主、富农，当然封建消灭的就不彻底。被斗过的地富每人平均还有三亩好地，贫农分了些坏地，最多的每人才平均二亩半。这个经验告诉我们：整党是一件深入细致的工作，需深入实际的调查、研究、分析各种情况，不能简单从成份或数目字出发。
