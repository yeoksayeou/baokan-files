    People of Pu County Hope: Higher-Level Orders Should Not Change Frequently

　　[This Newspaper's News] The people of Pu County universally hope that higher authorities will be more cautious when issuing orders and deciding on work guidelines and plans, and that they will not change them frequently. In this county, at the beginning of the wheat season this year, it was announced that industry and dependents would not cultivate land on behalf of others, and then it was announced that they would. Public firewood was originally set at four catties exchanged for one catty of rice, but then it was changed to five catties. The autumn public grain was originally to be levied according to natural mu, but it didn't work, and it was changed to one catty per mu for third, fourth, and fifth-grade land... This practice of saying something today and correcting it tomorrow has added a lot of difficulty for village cadres. Yan Huijian, a cadre in the first district, told reporters: "The top changes a line, and the bottom changes ten inches. It is very difficult for village cadres." In the fifth district, when ordered to change the method of collection, District Secretary Ding Bogao convened a meeting of village cadres to discuss it. Some village cadres said: "What's there to discuss? When holding a mass meeting, plug your ears (meaning that you can't hear the complaints of the masses)." If it was just a matter of talking back and forth with the masses, it would be easier to handle; the problem is that some work has already been done halfway. For example, the autumn tax registers have already been made, and they have to be redone. When the land above the fifth grade is taxed, although the burden is not heavier than last year, the masses are still unhappy and hate the constant changes. When the masses are annoyed, the cadres get glared at. Therefore, some village cadres have learned to be smart and put the work aside first, fearing to take the lead. According to several district cadres in the first district, village cadres are not very daring to take the lead now; whoever acts first suffers the most. Song Jiacun, deputy secretary of the first district committee, inspected work in Su Haozhuang and urged Han Fushun, the financial and economic committee member, to quickly make the autumn tax registers. The answer he received was: "Don't panic, it's not too late to make it after it changes three times." The change in the autumn tax method is the responsibility of the county party committee, because it did not accurately estimate the situation, and it has been reviewed at the county party committee meeting in early November. However, some of the changes in methods come from higher-level leading organs. Therefore, the county party committee also hopes that higher-level leading organs will be cautious and mature when deciding on issues. (Qing)

    (Editor's note: The demands of the people of Pu County are correct. When making resolutions and issuing orders, leading organs at all levels should conduct thorough investigations and studies in many aspects, and carefully consider all possible situations, so as to avoid changing them again when they are not feasible or problems arise. This can enable lower-level cadres and the masses to have something to follow and save a lot of trouble. Even if there are situations that must be changed, attention should also be paid to what should be done in places where the old methods have already been followed, and orders cannot be issued in general terms and then left alone. Of course, this cannot be interpreted as meaning that mistakes can be ignored in order to save trouble. For example, if the distribution of public grain in a certain place is very unfair, even if it is very troublesome to redo it, it still needs to be changed.)

### 濮县群众希望：上级命令不要时常改变

　　濮县群众希望：上级命令不要时常改变
    【本报讯】濮县群众普遍希望上级在发布命令，决定工作方针、计划之时，更加慎重一些，不要时常改变。该县在今年麦头里，刚刚宣布了工属不代耕，接着又宣布代耕。公柴原定每四斤折米一斤，一会又改成五斤。秋季公粮原定按自然亩征收，行不通，又改为三、四、五级地每亩征一斤多………这种今天说了、明天更正的作法，给村干部增加了好多困难。一区干部阎惠俭语记者：“上边改一线，下边改十寸。村干部很难办。”在五区，当奉命改变收征办法时，区书丁伯高召集村干部开会讨论，有的村干说：“讨论啥？开群众会的时候，把耳朵眼子塞住吧（意指这样可以听不见群众的埋怨之声）。”如果仅仅和群众翻过来掉过去地说一说，还好办些；问题在于有些工作已经作了半截，比方秋征册子已经造好，又得重新来过。当五级以上的土地加征时，虽然比起去年来负担并不重，群众也老不高兴，嫌翻蹬得烦人。群众一烦，干部就得吃白眼珠子。因此，有的村干学乖了，工作布置下来，先放在一边，怕打头阵。据一区几个区干部说，现在村干部是不大敢带头了，谁作在头里，谁吃亏就大。一区分委副书记宋家存到苏郝庄检查工作，督促财经委员韩福顺快造秋征册子，他得到的回答是：“你别慌，变三变再造不晚”。秋征办法的改变，责在县委，因为没有准确地估计情况，在十一月初的县委会上已作检讨。但是有些办法的变来变去，则是由高级的领导机关来的。因此，县委也很希望高级领导机关决定问题时，要慎重、成熟。（青）
    （编者按：濮县群众的要求是正确的。各级领导机关在做决议、发命令时，应该进行多方面的周密调查研究，慎重考虑各种可能发生的情况，以免在实行不通或出了毛病时又来改变，这样可以使下级干部与群众都有所遵循，省许多麻烦。即使有非改不可的情况发生，亦应注意到已经照旧办法做了的地方该怎么办，不能笼统地下了令完事。当然，这不能解释为为了省麻烦，就可以见错不改。比如某地派公粮十分不公，即使再做起来十分麻烦，也还是需要改的。）
