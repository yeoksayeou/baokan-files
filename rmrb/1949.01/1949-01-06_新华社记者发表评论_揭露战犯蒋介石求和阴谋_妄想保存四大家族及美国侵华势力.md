Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi North, 3rd. Regarding the matter of war criminals seeking peace, a Xinhua News Agency reporter published a commentary saying: In order to preserve Chinese reactionary forces and American aggressive forces in China, China's number one war criminal, Kuomintang bandit gang leader Chiang Kai-shek, issued a peace declaration on New Year's Day this year. War criminal Chiang Kai-shek declared: "As long as the peace talks do not harm the country's independence and integrity, and are helpful to the people's recuperation and development; as long as the sacred constitution is not violated by me, and democratic constitutionalism is not thereby destroyed; as long as the Republic of China's national system can be ensured, and the Republic of China's legal system is not interrupted; as long as the army has a reliable guarantee, and the people can maintain their free way of life and current minimum living standards, then I personally have no other demands. I only hope that peace can be achieved, then my personal advancement, retreat, and whereabouts will never be a concern, and I will only follow the public opinion of the people." People should not think that the war criminal's seeking peace is somewhat ridiculous, nor should they think that such a peace declaration is really abominable. It must be known that the fact that the number one war criminal, the Kuomintang bandit leader, comes out to seek peace and issues such a statement has a clear benefit for the Chinese people to understand the Kuomintang bandit gang and American imperialism's conspiracy plans. The Chinese people can thus know: it turns out that the so-called "peace" that is now being clamored for is what Chiang Kai-shek, this gang of murderers, and their American masters urgently need. Chiang Kai-shek confessed the entire plan of the bandits. The main points of this plan are as follows: "Not harmful to the country's independence and integrity" - this is primarily important. "Peace" is acceptable, but "peace" that is harmful to the "independence and integrity" of the country of the four big families and the comprador landlord class, that is absolutely unacceptable. "Peace" that is harmful to the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, the Sino-American Air Transport Agreement, the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement, and other wonderful treaties; harmful to the United States stationing naval, land, and air forces in China, establishing military bases, developing minerals, and monopolizing trade; harmful to the status of treating China as a colony of the United States, is all unacceptable. "Helpful to the people's recuperation and development" - "peace" must be helpful to the recuperation and development of the Chinese reactionaries who have been defeated but not yet eliminated, so that after they have recuperated, they can make a comeback and extinguish the revolution. "Peace" is for this. After fighting for two and a half years, the running dogs do not leave, and the Americans get angry, even if it is just for a little recuperation. "The sacred constitution is not violated by me, democratic constitutionalism is not thereby destroyed, the Republic of China's national system can be ensured, and the Republic of China's legal system is not interrupted" - Ensure the ruling position of the Chinese reactionary class and the reactionary government, and ensure that the "legal system" of this class and this government is not "interrupted." This "legal system" must never be "interrupted." If it is "interrupted," it is very dangerous; the entire comprador landlord class will be eliminated, the Kuomintang bandit gang will be destroyed, and all major and minor war criminals will be arrested and punished. In the Grand View Garden, Jia Baoyu's lifeblood is a stone tied around his neck; the Kuomintang's lifeblood is its army. How can we say that it is not "guaranteed," or even if there is a "guarantee," it is not "reliable"? "The people can maintain their free way of life and current minimum living standards" - The Chinese comprador landlord class must maintain its freedom to carry out oppression and exploitation and its current extravagant and licentious living standards; the Chinese working people must maintain their freedom to be oppressed and exploited and their current starving and freezing living standards. This is the ultimate purpose of the war criminals seeking peace. If the war criminals and their class cannot maintain their freedom to carry out oppression and exploitation and their extravagant and licentious living standards, what is the use of peace? And to have this, of course, it is necessary to maintain the current "free way of life and minimum living standards" for workers, peasants, intellectuals, and public employees. Once this condition was put forward by our beloved President Chiang, tens of millions of workers, hundreds of millions of peasants, and millions of intellectuals and public employees clapped their hands together, prostrated themselves on the ground, and shouted "Long live!" If the Communist Party still does not allow peace talks, then it deserves to die, and "all future responsibilities will be borne by the Communist Party." The Xinhua News Agency reporter said: The above does not include all the treasures in the war criminal's January 1st peace declaration. Here is another treasure, which Chiang Kai-shek calls the "decisive battle in the Jinghu region." Chiang Kai-shek said: "You must know that the government's strength in military, political, and economic aspects is several times or even dozens of times greater than that of the Communist Party today." Oh my, how can such a great power not scare people to death? Let's put aside the political and economic strengths for now and not talk about them. Just in terms of military strength, the People's Liberation Army now has more than three million people. Two times that is more than six million people, ten times that is more than thirty million people, "dozens of times" is how much? Let's just calculate it as twenty times, which would be more than sixty million people. No wonder our great President Chiang said he "has the confidence to win." Why seek peace? It's not that we can't fight at all. If we use more than sixty million people to suppress them, what Communist Party or any other party in the world will there be? Of course, they will all be turned into powder. From this, it can be seen that seeking peace is not for anything else, but entirely to "plead for the people's lives." Is everything good, without any shortcomings? It is said that there are shortcomings. What shortcomings? President Chiang said: "What is regrettable now is that some members of our government have been affected by the Communist Party's evil propaganda, and as a result, they are mentally shaken and have almost lost their self-confidence. Because they are mentally threatened by the Communist Party, they see the enemy's strength, but they do not see that they have dozens of times more strength than the enemy." There is news every year, but this year is particularly different. The Kuomintang, which has more than sixty million officers and soldiers, cannot see their own sixty million, but instead sees the People's Liberation Army's three million. Isn't this still a special news item? To ask whether such news is still marketable in the market, whether it is still worth people's attention, according to the news we have obtained from the city of Beiping: "New Year's Day prices fell slightly in the morning and recovered in the afternoon." The Associated Press said: "The reaction in Shanghai to Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's address was lukewarm." This answers the question of the marketability of war criminal Chiang Kai-shek. We have long said that Chiang Kai-shek has lost his soul and is just a corpse. No one believes him anymore.

  　揭露战犯蒋介石求和阴谋
    妄想保存四大家族及美国侵华势力
    【新华社陕北三日电】关于战犯求和一事，新华社记者发表评论说：为了保存中国反动势力和美国在华侵略势力，中国第一号战争罪犯国民党匪帮首领蒋介石在今年元旦发表了一篇求和声明。战犯蒋介石宣称：“只要和议无害于国家的独立完整，而有助于人民的休养生息，只要神圣的宪法不由我而违反，民主宪政不因此而破坏，中华民国的国体能够确保，中华民国的法统不致中断，军队有确实的保障，人民能够维持其自由的生活方式与目前最低生活水准，则我个人更无复他求。只望和平果能实现，则个人的进退出处，绝不萦怀，而一惟国民的公意是从。”人们不要以为战犯求和未免滑稽，也不要以为这样的求和声明实在可恶。须知由第一号战犯国民党匪首出而求和，并且发表这样的声明，对于中国人民认识国民党匪帮和美国帝国主义的阴谋计划，有一种显然的利益。中国人民可以由此知道：原来现在喧嚷着的所谓“和平”，就是蒋介石这一伙杀人凶犯及其美国主子所迫切地需要的东西。蒋介石供认了匪帮们的整个计划。这个计划的要点如下：“无害于国家的独立完整”——这是首先重要的。“和平”可以，“和平”而有害于四大家族和买办地主阶级的国家的“独立完整”，那就万万不可以。“和平”而有害于中美友好通商航海条约、中美航空运输协定、中美双边协定等等美妙的条约，有害于美国在华驻扎海陆空军，建立军事基地，开发矿产和独占贸易等等特权，有害于将中国作为美国殖民地的地位，那就一概不可以。“有助于人民的休养生息”——“和平”必须有助于已被击败而尚未消灭的中国反动派的休养生息，以便在休养好了之后，卷土重来，扑灭革命。“和平”就是为了这个。打了两年半了，走狗不走，美国人即生气，就是稍为休养一会儿也好。“神圣的宪法不由我而违反，民主宪政不因此而破坏，中华民国的国体能够确保，中华民国的法统不致中断”——确保中国反动阶级和反动政府的统治地位，确保这个阶级和这个政府的“法统不致中断”。这个“法统”是万万“中断”不得的，倘若“中断”了，那是很危险的，整个买办地主阶级将被消灭，国民党匪帮将告灭亡，一切大中小战争罪犯将被捉拿治罪。“军队有确实的保障”——这是买办地主阶级的命根，虽然已被可恶的人民解放军歼灭了几百万，但是现在还剩下一百几十万，务须保障而且“确实”。倘若“保障”而不“确实”，买办地主阶级就没有了本钱，“法统”还是要“中断”，国民党匪帮还是要灭亡，一切大中小战犯还是要被捉拿治罪。大观园里贾宝玉的命根是系在颈上的一块石头，国民党的命根是它的军队，怎么好说不“保障”，或者虽有“保障”而不“确实”呢？“人民能够维持其自由的生活方式与目前最低生活水准”——中国买办地主阶级必须维持其实行压迫剥削的自由与目前的骄奢淫逸的生活水准，中国劳动人民必须维持其被人压迫剥削的自由与目前的饥寒交迫的生活水准。这是战犯求和的终极目的。倘若战犯们及其阶级不能维持其实行压迫剥削的自由和骄奢淫逸的生活水准，和平有什么用呢？而要这个，当然就要维持工人农民知识分子公教人员目前这样的“自由生活方式与最低生活水准”。这个条件一经我们可爱的蒋大总统提了出来，几千万的工人，几万万的农民，几百万的知识分子和公教人员一齐拍掌，五体投地，口称万岁。倘若共产党还不许和，那就罪该万死，“今后一切责任皆由共党负之”。新华社记者说：上述一切，还没有包括一月一日战犯求和声明中的一切宝贝。下面是另一个宝贝，蒋介石称之为“京沪决战”。蒋介石说：“要知道政府今天在军事、政治、经济无论那一方面的力量，都要超过共党几倍乃至几十倍。”哎呀呀，这么大的力量怎样会不叫人们吓得要死呢？姑且把政治、经济两方面的力量放在一边不去说它们，单就军事力量一方面来说，人民解放军现在是三百多万人，两倍就是六百多万人，十倍就是三千多万人，“几十倍”是多少呢？姑且算作二十倍罢，就有六千多万人，无怪乎我们的蒋大总统要说“有决胜的把握”了。为什么求和呢？完全不是不能打，拿六千多万人压下去，世界上还有什么共产党或者什么别的党呢，当然一概成了粉末。由此可见，求和不是为了别的，完全是“为民请命”。难道万事皆好，一个缺点也没有么？据说：缺点是有的。什么缺点呢，蒋大总统说：“现在所遗憾的，我们政府方面一部分人员受了共党恶宣传，因之心里动摇，几乎失了自信。因为他们在精神上受了共党的威胁，所以就看见敌人的力量，而就看不见自己还有比敌人超过几十倍的大力量存在。”新闻年年皆有，今年特别不同。拥有六千多万名军官和兵士的国民党人看不见自己的六千多万，倒看见了人民解放军三百多万，这难道还不是一条特别新闻么？要问这样的新闻是否在市场上尚有销路，是否尚值得人们看上一眼，根据我们所得的北平城内的消息是：“元旦物价上午略跌，下午复原。”美联社说：“上海对于蒋介石新年致词的反映是冷淡的。”这就答复战犯蒋介石的销路问题。我们早就说过，蒋介石已经失了灵魂，只是一具僵尸，什么人也不相信他了。
