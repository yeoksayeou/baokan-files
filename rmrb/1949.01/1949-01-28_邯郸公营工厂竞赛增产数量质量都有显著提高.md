[Jinan Telegram] Workers in Handan's public factories have undergone half a year of study, their ideological awareness has been raised to an unprecedented level, and they have spontaneously launched a production increase competition, which has achieved great results. The Fuchang Flour Company's average daily flour production from July to September was 400 to 500 bags, and in October it was 700 bags. Although there was a slight increase month by month, the output did not increase much because some employees did not fully understand the meaning of being the factory's owner, and their production enthusiasm was not fully utilized. After a review in November, the factory management continuously mobilized the workers by comparing output and calculating specific accounts. The workers began to realize that less production would cause great losses to the factory and to themselves, and that the factory's failure would be their shame. They automatically requested the establishment of a product comparison chart to compare production increases and product quality. After this, the total flour production soared, with the highest output increasing to 955 bags per day. Converted at market prices, this increased national wealth by more than 555,900 yuan (new currency, same below) compared to November. Especially after the launch of the competition in recent days, the production enthusiasm has become even higher. Ma Zhenqing and Yang Shukai, who work overlapping shifts on the flour milling floor, feared falling behind, so on December 2nd, Ma's shift produced 463 bags, and on December 3rd, Yang's shift produced 473 bags. All the workers in Ma's shift worked even harder. The worker in charge of fueling on the night shift, Ping Jie, kept his eyes on the machine until dawn. Zhou Ruyin, who was in charge of managing the millstones, never left the mill room. With the concerted efforts of the entire shift, they produced 482 bags in one night. They were not satisfied with this and believed that this was just the beginning of increased production. The Hengtai Factory recently relocated. Through the active efforts of all employees, it was settled within one day and production resumed as usual. After entering winter, the days became shorter, and the workers squeezed their working hours very tightly, with more than 20 iron machines clattering all day long. Worker Zhang Shunbao weaves two bolts of local cloth a day, doubling his previous output. The Quality Assessment Committee evaluates the quality of products every day, and the quality is also improving day by day. In addition, in order to improve the skills of apprentices, technician Feng Bingwen is responsible for leading meetings every three days to study techniques. The apprentices are very happy and compete to practice on the machines every day, and their output and skills have greatly developed. For example, Yang Yingkui and Huang Shikui used to weave one bolt of cloth in four days, but now they weave one bolt of cloth in two days, and the quality is also good. To welcome the arrival of national victory, they are redoubling their efforts to increase production.

　　邯郸公营工厂竞赛增产数量质量都有显著提高
    【冀南电】邯郸市公营工厂工人经过半年来的学习，思想觉悟空前提高，自动掀起增产竞赛，已获巨大成绩。复昌面粉公司七、八、九月份每日平均产面四至五百袋，十月为七百袋。虽逐月稍有增加，但由于有些职工对自己就是工厂主人的意义还认识不够，生产热情没有充分发挥，产量仍增加不多。经十一月检查后，厂部又不断以产量对比、具体算帐作动员，职工们开始觉悟到少出产对工厂对自己都有很大损失，工厂搞不好是自己的耻辱，他们自动要求建立产品比较表，比增产、比货质。此后面粉总产量突飞猛进，最高量增至日出九百五十五袋。按市价折合，较十一月增加国家财富五十五万五千九百余元（新币，下同）。特别近几天发起竞赛后，生产情绪更为高涨。制粉楼上马振卿和杨书魁两倒减班，恐怕落在人后，十二月二日马班出面四百六十三袋，三日杨班出面四百七十三袋。马班全体工人更加努力。平节上负责加油的工人，上了夜班就目不转睛地看着机器一直到天明。管理磨子的周如寅天天不离磨房。在全班一致加油下，一晚出到四百八十二袋。他们并不因此满足，而认为这仅是增产的开始。恒泰工厂日前迁址，经全体职工积极努力，一天内即安置就绪，照常复工。入冬后天气渐短，工人们把工作时间挤的很紧，二十余架铁机整天哒达响着。工人张顺保一天织土线布两匹，比过去增加一倍。质量评委会每日评定产品优劣，质量也逐日进步。另外为提高学徒技术，由技工冯丙文负责领导，每三天开会一次，研究技术，学徒们非常高兴，每天争着上机子练习，产量和技术得到大大发展。如杨英魁、黄士魁过去四天才织一匹布，现在两天织一匹布，并且质量也好。为迎接全国胜利的到来，他们正加倍紧张地努力增产。
