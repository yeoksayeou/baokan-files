　　Raoyang Dongjiuji Village
  　Should Not Bully Widowed and Lonely Family Members of Martyrs
    Editor:
    I. Before the Incident, my family farmed forty mu (small mu) of land, had eight rooms, one ox, all farm tools, and one cart, with a family of seven. My husband and son were both farmers, and the whole family relied on farming for a living, without any other income. Except for hiring one or two short-term laborers during the autumn harvest, my husband and son did all the other work. My family had not hired long-term laborers since before 1940. After the Incident, my family property remained the same as before, and my son, Zhang Xing, joined the anti-Japanese work. Before May 1st, my husband died. After May 1st, my son served as the deputy captain of the special task force in the county Public Security Bureau and unfortunately died in Chang'an Village in December 1942 after encountering the enemy. At this time, my family completely lost its labor force and could only rely on my daughter-in-law and myself to participate in production and on the village to provide labor for cultivation to maintain our lives. In 1945, the district and village cadres advised me to hire a half-time long-term worker, both to avoid trouble for the village and to make it easier for us without having to constantly ask the village for people. So, I hired a half-time long-term worker, hiring a total of three half-year long-term workers until 1947. At this time, my land remained untouched, except that I jointly raised an ox with someone else. There were four people left in my family (another granddaughter had died): my daughter-in-law and myself, a grandson who was only ten years old, and a granddaughter who was only seven years old. During the land distribution last year, the village classified my family as rich peasants and confiscated 23 mu of land, three dou of grain, ten strips of peanuts, one pig, all firewood, and other items. I asked the village why they classified me as a rich peasant, and they said it was based on the fact that I had hired three half-year long-term workers. I said that if my son hadn't sacrificed himself, I wouldn't have needed to hire long-term workers. A district cadre surnamed Zhao said, "It's his own fault that your son died; he was useless." I cried for several days after hearing this. I ask, what exactly is my class status? Is it right for the district cadre to say that a martyr's sacrifice was his own fault? What should be done about the confiscated items? (Editor's note: The act of a martyr's family without labor hiring long-term workers to cultivate land should not be considered an exploitative act. Therefore, classifying them as rich peasants is wrong and should be corrected at the end of the land reform.)
    II. Last winter, during the autumn grain collection, because I had no labor force and the land didn't produce any grain, I owed four bolts of coarse cloth, six jin of cotton, and more than 300 jin of public grain. At that time, I said I would convert goods into cash, but the village's poor peasant league wouldn't let me sell them to others, only allowing me to sell them to the poor peasant league. As a result, they valued my cart, two trees, three chests, one wardrobe, one entrance cabinet, and one large jar at over 200,000 yuan. My items were worth about 3 million yuan at the market price at the time, or even more now. Isn't this bullying and forcing me? As a result, I cannot pay this year's public grain. How should this problem be resolved?
    III. Before the land reform last year, my daughter was from Zhangqiu Village and belonged to a poor peasant family. She asked my daughter-in-law to buy three sacks of wheat and transport them to my house. The village confiscated the wheat and told us to get proof from Zhangqiu. Later, we got a letter of proof, but the village cadres at the time, Wang Zhiyuan, Liu Yuanzhi, etc., kept passing the buck and didn't care, and they still confiscated it. This spring, the village said they would return half of it to me, and use the remaining half to offset expenses. My daughter didn't want to because it was her wheat. At this time, the village official in charge of the matter, Shuangli, didn't care and wouldn't return any of it. Should this wheat have been confiscated? What should I do if the village refuses to return it?
    IV. I am now seventy years old, my daughter-in-law is in her thirties, my grandson is ten years old, and my granddaughter is only seven years old. My whole family is having financial difficulties and has no labor force. Should the village take care of widowed and lonely family members of martyrs like me? How should they take care of us? Please let me know.
    I hope the editor can clearly answer the above four questions in the newspaper. My whole family will only rely on our government to live from now on, and we have no other hope. Please also forward this to the county government so they can resolve this promptly.

　　饶阳东九吉村
  　不应欺负孤寡烈属
    编者同志：
    一、我家在事变前种地四十亩（小亩），房八间，养牛一头，农具都有，大车一辆，人七口。我丈夫和儿子都是庄稼人，全家都是依靠务农为生，没有其他任何收入。除在秋忙时雇一两个短工以外，其他时的活都是丈夫和儿子来做。我家从四零年前就没有雇过长工，事变后家产同前一样，我儿张星即参加抗日工作。“五一”前丈夫死去，“五一”后我儿在本县公安局任特务队副队长，不幸于一九四二年十二月在常安村遇敌牺牲。这时我家劳动力完全丧失，只有依靠我和儿媳参加生产，及村中代耕来维持生活。至一九四五年，区村干部都劝我雇半个长工，一来免去村中麻烦，二来我们也方便不用经常去找村中要人，于是我就雇了半个长工，雇至一九四七年共雇了三个半年长工。这时我的地没动，只是和人家伙养牛一头了，家中剩人四口（又死了一个孙女），我和我儿媳还有一个孙子才十岁，有一个孙女才七岁。在去年土地平分时，村中把我家订成富农，没收了我家的土地二十三亩，粮食三斗、花生十条，猪一口，柴草全部等物，我曾经问村中为什么把我订成富农成份，据说是根据我雇了三个半年长工。我说要不是我儿牺牲，我就用不着雇长工，惹的一个姓赵的区干部说：“你儿死是活该，没用。”我听了这话我直哭了好几天，请问我这到底是什么成份？区干部这样说烈士牺牲是活该对不对？没收了我家的东西怎么办？（编者按：无劳力的烈属雇用长工耕种土地不应算剥削行为，因之订为富农是错误的，结束土改时应予纠正。）
    二、去年冬天秋征的时候我因为没有劳动力，地里不打粮食，欠小布四匹、棉花六斤、公粮三百多斤。当时我说折变东西，但村中贫农团不叫卖给别人，只许可卖给贫农团。结果把我的大车一辆、树两个、箱三个、躺柜一个、迎门橱一个，头号大瓮一个，折合了二十余万元，我的东西按当时市价约值三百余万元，按现在还多。这样的限制我和强迫我这不是欺侮人吗？以致我今年的公粮就无法交纳，请问这个问题怎样解决？
    三、去年土改前我闺女是张邱村的，家中是个贫农成份。她托我儿媳买了三口袋麦子拉到我家，村中就把麦子扣留了，叫我们去张邱取证明，后来我们取了证明信来，当时的村干部王志远、刘元之等你推我我推你谁也不管，硬没收了。今年春天村中说退给我一半，下剩的一半顶了差，我闺女不愿意，因为是她的麦子，这时村中的办公人爽利不管了，一点也不给退了。请问这麦子是不是应当没收？村中不给退怎么办？
    四、我现在年已七十，儿媳三十多岁，孙子十岁，一个孙女才七岁，全家生活困难，又没有劳动力。象我这样孤儿寡妇的烈属，村中应不应照顾？怎样照顾请告知。
    以上四个问题希望编者在报上明白答复，我全家今后只有依靠咱们的政府过日子，没有别的指望，并请转达我县县政府及时解决是盼。
