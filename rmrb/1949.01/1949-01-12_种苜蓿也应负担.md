　　Planting Alfalfa Should Also Bear Burdens
    Question: In several villages northeast of Gaoyi, such as Fangshan and Qiucun, there is a lot of sandy land. In addition to mobilizing tree planting, alfalfa used to be planted in this area. When it is mentioned that alfalfa should be planted again, some people are very willing, but they hesitate when it comes to burdens. In last year's "Provisional Measures for Agricultural Tax in North China", there was no explicit provision in the third article regarding tax collection, only that it would be supplemented in the detailed rules, but the detailed rules have not been seen. Therefore, please explain whether planting alfalfa requires bearing burdens?

    Answer: Planting alfalfa on sandy land is also a type of land income, so it should also bear burdens. However, sandy land that cannot grow grain has a very low assessed yield, and the burden is naturally much lighter than that of good land. It is definitely not calculated based on the income from planting alfalfa. Therefore, you should boldly try to utilize sandy land as much as possible and not be overly concerned about the burden.

　　种苜蓿也应负担
    问：高邑东北有几个村，如坊珊、邱村等村沙地很多，除发动植树外，过去这地方种过苜蓿，一提到再种苜蓿，有的人很愿意，但在负担上打圈子。去年华北农业税暂行办法上，第三条征收项内，又没明文规定，只说细则中补充，但又没见到细则。因此请解释一下，种苜蓿是否须缴纳负担？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　高邑棉场国权
    答：沙地种苜蓿，也是土地收入的一种，所以也应该负担，但不能种粮食的沙地，评产量亦是很低的，负担当然比好地轻得多，决不是按种苜蓿收入计算负担，所以应该大胆的尽量想法利用沙地，不需要在负担上过分顾虑。
