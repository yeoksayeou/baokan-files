  　邱匪清泉被击毙
    【新华社淮海前线十九日电】国民党军第二兵团司令邱匪清泉现已查明被击毙。其尸体已在永城东北四十里张庙堂西南四百米达处查获。邱匪清泉系浙江温州人，国民党黄埔军校二期毕业，曾任该校教官、政治主任，国民党军第二十二师师长，第五军副军长、军长。一九四六年第五军整编为第五师，邱匪任师长。一九四七年冬该师扩编为军，邱仍任军长。一九四八年八月匪国防部以第五军为骨干，组成第二兵团，邱匪任兵团副司令。同年十月升为司令。
    蒋贼介石最亲信干部和最坚决的反革命分子之一的邱匪清泉，曾在法西斯德国参谋大学毕业，是希特勒的疯狂崇拜者。一九四五年冬驻防昆明时，曾下令枪杀爱国学生，造成震动全国的“一二、一”惨案。一九四六年七月蒋介石发动反革命内战后，邱匪在解放区曾进行疯狂的破坏和屠杀，仅冀鲁豫四、五两分区即杀害居民达两千多人。此次由徐州败逃途中，又命令萧县伪县长强抓二百多名妇女，充作军妓。作恶多端、杀人如麻的邱匪清泉恶贯满盈，被人民解放军击毙，得到其应得的惩罚。他是淮海战役中国民党匪军被击毙的第二个兵团司令，第一个是第七兵团司令黄匪百韬。
