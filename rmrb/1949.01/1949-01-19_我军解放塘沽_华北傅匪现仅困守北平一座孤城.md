Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Tianjin-Beiping, 17th: The People's Liberation Army occupied Tanggu, an important seaport in North China, at 5:30 AM today. The defending enemy's 17th Army Corps, under Hou Jingru, fled by sea. With the liberation of Tianjin and Tanggu, the Fu Zuoyi bandit army in North China is left with only the isolated city of Beiping. The day of the liberation of Beiping and all of North China is approaching.

Note: Tanggu is a vital town along the Beining Railway leading to the sea from Tianjin. It combines the three districts of Dagu, Hangu, and Denggu into the only salt and alkali producing region in North China, namely the Changlu Salt District, with a total of 46,000 salt workers. Together with Gukou on the south bank, it is known as Tangda. From here, the Beining Railway runs west to Tianjin and Beiping, and east via Tangshan and Shanhaiguan to Shenyang. The railway also connects to the first and second docks from the station, a distance of ten kilometers. The Jin-Tang Highway provides road access directly to Tianjin, while waterways along the Hai River lead to Tianjin. Maritime transport can reach Yingkou, Yantai, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places. Yongli Chemical Industrial Company, Jiuda Salt Industry Company, China Salt Industry Company, and other enterprises have established refined salt, alkali production, and chemical factories here. There are also shipbuilding and iron factories such as Zhenxing Shipyard, Donggu Shipyard, Jardine Matheson Ironworks, and Asiatic Petroleum Company oil tank factory. "Tanggu New Port," five kilometers east of Tanggu, is the largest trading port in Northern China, with an annual throughput of approximately two million tons. Larger ships engaged in maritime trade dock and unload here. The port was started by Japanese invaders in 1938, who established the puppet "North China New Port Temporary Construction Bureau," later renamed the puppet "Tanggu New Port Harbor Bureau." The first dock was completed in July 1942, with the remaining projects halted due to the war. After the Japanese surrender, the U.S. military landed here and designated the New Port as a base. Subsequently, Chiang Kai-shek sent personnel to take over. In April 1946, the puppet "Tanggu New Port Engineering Office" was established, becoming a major supply base for Chiang's troops in North China.

　　我军解放塘沽
  　华北傅匪现仅困守北平一座孤城
    【新华社平津前线十七日电】人民解放军今日上午五时半占领华北重要海港塘沽，守敌十七兵团侯镜如部乘船由海上逃窜。天津与塘沽的解放，使华北傅作义匪军，只剩下了北平一座孤城。北平和全华北解放的日子，即将到来。
    按：塘沽是天津沿北宁路通往海口的重镇，合大沽汉沽、邓沽三区为华北唯一的产盐、产碱区域即长芦盐区，盐工共有四万六千人，与南岸沽口合称为塘大。北宁铁路自此，西至天津、至北平，东经唐山、山海关至沈阳，铁路并自车站接至一、二码头，长十公里。公路有津塘公路直达天津，水路沿海河上行至天津，海上交通可达营口、烟台、青岛、上海、香港、广州等地。永利化学工业公司、久大盐业公司、中国盐业公司等企业，均在此设精盐、造碱及化学工厂。并有振兴修船所、东沽制船所、怡和公司铁工厂、亚细亚煤油罐厂等造船工厂及铁工厂。塘沽东五公里的“塘沽新港”，是中国北方最大的贸易港，每年吞吐量约二百万吨，海上往来吨位较大的船只，均在此港停泊装卸，该港于民国二十七年经日寇开始修建，设立伪“北支新港临时建设事务局”后改伪“塘沽新港港湾局”，在海港等地建海港，三十一年七月，第一码头落成，其余工程因战争停顿。日本投降后，美军在此登陆，将新港划为兵站基地，继为蒋匪派员接收。于三十五年四月，设立伪“塘沽新港工程处”，成为蒋贼用兵华北的主要补给地。
