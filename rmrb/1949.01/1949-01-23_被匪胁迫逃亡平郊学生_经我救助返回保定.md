Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 16th—Over a thousand students from Baoding, who were lured and coerced by the Kuomintang into fleeing and were stranded in ancient temples in Fragrant Hills, have begun to return to Baoding in batches after being rescued by the People's Liberation Army. The students recounted the deception to reporters, saying: On the eve of the Baoding Kuomintang bandit army's collapse, on the evening of November 20th of last year, the pseudo "Hebei Provincial Government" forcibly moved all schools in Baoding to Beiping, claiming that school sites, food, etc., were all prepared in Beiping, and that there would be automobiles for transportation along the way. However, as soon as the students left the city gate, they saw that the cars were loaded with the belongings and wives of bandit officers. The students could only walk, carrying their luggage, in the mud and dust raised by the wheels, even thirteen-year-old children and sixty-year-old teachers. On the hundred-li journey from Gucheng to Zhuoxian, they did not eat a single grain of food all day, and spent a cold winter rainy night crouching under the eaves. Upon arriving in Beiping, no one cared for them for a long time. Finally, the students were abandoned in the desolate ancient temples such as Biyun Temple and Wolong Temple in the Fragrant Hills area of ​​the western suburbs of Beiping, without rice or coal, and suffering from hunger and cold. After a unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated the Fragrant Hills area on December 13th, it immediately provided these students with the food, firewood, and coal that they had worked so hard to transport, and subsidized travel expenses for those who wished to return to Baoding. Currently, the first batch of over five hundred students has returned to Baoding, and the remaining students are also preparing to leave.

　　被匪胁迫逃亡平郊学生
  　经我救助返回保定
    【新华社平津前线十六日电】被国民党诱胁逃亡、困处香山古庙的保定学生千余人，经解放军救助，开始在分批返回保定。同学们向记者叙述被欺骗的经过说：保定国民党匪军溃逃的前夕，去年十一月廿日晚，伪“河北省府”即强迫保定各校迁移北平，并说校址、粮食等都已在平准备妥当，路上还有汽车运送。可是同学们一出城门，看到汽车里装载的全是匪军官长的家私和太太们，同学们只能在车轮卷起的泥水与灰尘中，背了行李走路，连十三岁的小孩与六十岁的老教员都一样。从固城到涿县一百里途中，整天未吃一颗粮食，蹲在屋檐下度过了一个寒冬的雨夜。到了北平，很久无人过问，最后把同学们抛弃在北平西郊香山地区之碧云寺、卧佛寺等阴森森的古庙里，无米无煤，饥寒交迫。十二月十三日解放军某部解放香山地区后，立即以自己千辛万苦运来的粮食和柴煤接济这些同学，愿意回保定的并资助旅费。现第一批五百余位同学已返保定，其余的同学亦正准备动身。
