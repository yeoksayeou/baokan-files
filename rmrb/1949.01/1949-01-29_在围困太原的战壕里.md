　　In the Trenches Besieging Taiyuan
    Che Min

　　The eastern mountains of Taiyuan are desolate beyond imagination. Scattered across the mountaintops are the steel and concrete structures, round, square, high, and low – isolated positions and group fortifications – that the Yan bandit troops had been defeated and blown apart. Not long ago, the Yan bandits boasted that this was an impregnable "permanent defense," but now they have become ruins, thrown far behind the advancing positions of the People's Liberation Army. The slopes are covered with withered thorns and reeds, with few large villages and even fewer of the small hamlets of "four or five families." There are no houses, and there is a shortage of water. The back of the mountains is already piled with frozen snow, and the biting northwest wind howls fiercely, but all these difficulties have not stopped the heroes besieging Taiyuan. The first squad of the second company's machine gun platoon, led by Squad Leader Cui Jinbao, built a small, pointed cave dwelling against an earthen ridge. Because the soil was very thin, to prevent it from collapsing, they opened two doors on the left and right, with a solid pillar in the middle. One lamp illuminated both sides, one stove warmed both sides. When holding squad meetings, everyone could hear each other, and no one interfered with anyone else's comings and goings. Fifth Company's Sixth Squad Leader Li Xinjie and artillery squad leader Niu Fatu had an even better method: together with all the brave men of their squads, they built walls of stone, with branches across the top, covered with grass and pressed down with earth. They hung a bed sheet over the door, and the inside was covered with a thick layer of cut grass to keep out the wind. They also plastered the small cracks in the walls with mud. When the sun shone, the sheet was rolled up to let in fresh air. The artillery company had no place to pen the livestock, so in a small, narrow slope, they dug downwards as much as possible, creating a square pit, covered with a door panel. The livestock entered and exited through the opening that was left, and ammunition boxes became the best feeding troughs.

　　In their spare time, people climbed the high hills to gather firewood and sing songs. The Second Battalion leaders loved their soldiers the most and stipulated that for every pound of firewood collected, the mess unit would issue ten yuan (Ji banknotes). The soldiers used the firewood money to buy cigarettes for the squad to smoke or to solve small difficulties. One day, the Sixth Company gathered 1,160 pounds of firewood, enough to burn for three days. Cook Lei Wangui of the guard company found a shiny silver dollar while gathering firewood and went to the instructor three times to hand it over to the public. It was difficult to get water here, and most people had to carry it from several miles away. Tu Bi, the cook squad leader of the Second Company, dug hard in the place where the pot was set up and found a little water. He and the others were indescribably happy. Although it looked like red bean and rice soup when boiled, the soldiers still praised it repeatedly, saying, "These conditions are not bad at all." The sapper company could not find enough pots to bake dry rations. Eighth Squad Leader Du Youjin used the earthen ridge to make earthen pots, laid stone slabs, and covered them with helmets, baking one pancake after another, making fragrant and delicious dry rations. The soldiers wrote a clapper rhyme on the bulletin board: Eighth Squad Leader, method is high, using stone slabs to bake the pie, overcoming difficulties, everyone praises him, contributing to the battle of Taiyuan, commending his new creation.

　　In such "barracks," the lamps were made of grenade casings, one of which could be broken into two. At night or during the day, commanders and fighters enthusiastically discussed the experiences of storming the cities of Yuncheng and Linfen, discussing how to break through and scale the city if the higher-ups issued an order for a general attack on Taiyuan. The commanders corrected the soldiers' understanding; the fighters also revised the commanders' opinions, extensively carrying out military democracy and giving full play to the intelligence and wisdom of each combat member. In order to ensure victory, they not only exhausted their intelligence and wisdom, but also dedicated their own materials to the victorious war. Fourth Squad Leader Cui Wenxue tore his only quilt to make masks for everyone. In the Fifth Company alone, more than twenty people modified their only single military jackets into explosive vests. Division Deputy Battalion Commander Shi Changsheng of the First Battalion gathered six soldiers who had modified such explosive vests, each carrying twenty-five grenades. On a small open space, they all lay down on a whistle, and then all got up and ran forward on another whistle, seeing who could throw all the grenades first, and seeing who could advance without dropping grenades. The comrades of the First Company had a good method and could throw twenty-five grenades in one minute. Not only did they think of methods while practicing, but after completing an action, they also repeatedly checked: whether the actions were skilled, and whether the material preparations were complete. When the regiment checked the preparations of the assault companies, they gave a loud answer: "Everything is ready, we are just waiting for Commander Xu (as the soldiers affectionately called Commander Xu) to issue the attack order."

### 在围困太原的战壕里

　　在围困太原的战壕里
    车敏
    太原的东山，是人们想象不到的荒凉。山顶上，星罗棋布，尽是些阎匪被打垮与炸翻了的钢骨水泥，圆的，方的，高的，低的，孤立阵地，集团工事。不久以前，阎匪尚自夸这里是铜墙铁壁的“永久设防”，而现在竟一个个成为残骸，远远抛扔在解放军前进阵地之后了。漫坡里，满布着枯萎的荆棘和茅草，大村子是没有，所谓烟村四五家的小庄庄也不多。没有房子，还缺水吃，背山里早已堆积了结冰的雪，高寒的西北风刺骨的在吼叫，但所有这一切困难，却丝毫没有难住围困太原的英雄们。二连机枪第一班，在班长崔金保同志的率领下，靠着一条土坎，打了一个尖顶的小窑洞，因土质很薄，避免塌下来，便在左右开起两个门，当中是个实心柱，一盏灯两边明，一炉火两边暖，开起班务会，两下都听见，进来出去，谁也不妨谁的事。五连六班长李新杰，炮班长牛发土，他们的办法更好：他们同全班的健儿们，用石头垒起墙，顶上横挡着树枝，盖上草，压点土，门上挂起了被单，里边铺着厚厚一层割来的草，不让刮进来一点风，还用土抹住墙壁上的小缝缝，阳光射来的时候，被单子朝上一搭，通通新鲜空气。炮兵连的牲口没处圈，就在一块狭小的坡地里，竭力的往下挖，四方形的深坑，盖起门板，牲口由留下的门洞里走进走出，子弹箱成了最好的食槽。
    课余的时间人们都爬上高高的山岗，打着柴、唱着歌。二营首长最爱自己的战士，规定了打一斤柴，伙食单位发给十块钱（冀钞），战士们把柴价拿来班里大家买烟吸或解决小困难。六连一天打柴一千一百六十斤，足足三天烧不完。警卫连炊事员雷万贵同志，打柴的时候，拾得一块白花花的银洋、三次去找指导员缴了公。这里吃水很困难，多是到几里路外去担，二连炊事班长土壁，就在安锅的地方往下猛掏，出现了一点水，喜＠＠的有说不出的高兴，虽然煮在锅里，好象红豆米汤，但战士们总还连声赞颂着说：“这个条件可不坏。”工兵连烧干粮找不到那么多的锅，八班长杜有金同志，就依土坎掏成锅土，架起石板，盖着钢盔，一张一张的饼烧熟了，做着又香又美的干粮，战士们在门板报上编出快板：八班长，办法高，利用石板把饼烧，困难克服了，大家叫他呱呱叫，打太原有功劳，表扬他的新创造。
    在这样的“营房”里，点的灯，是手榴弹壳，一颗可以打破做两个。夜晚或白天，指挥员，战斗员，热烈地讨论着运城和临汾登城的经验，讨论着上级如果下命令总攻太原，应当如何突破如何登城，指挥员纠正了战士的认识；战斗员也修正了指挥员的意见，广泛开展了军事民主，充分发挥了每个战斗成员的聪明和智慧。为了保证打胜仗，不但用尽了聪明与智慧，并把自己的物资，也献给了胜利的战争，四班长崔文学，把仅存的被单子，撕开给大家作口罩。仅五连一个连，就有二十多人把自己仅有的单军褂，改制炸弹衣，一营副营长师长生同志，集合了这样改制炸弹衣的六个战士，各带二十五颗手榴弹，在一块不大的平地上，一声哨子齐卧倒，又一声哨子全爬起往前跑，看谁先投完，看谁前进手榴弹不丢掉。一连的同志带法好，一分钟就投完二十五颗手榴弹。不仅边想办法边试练，做完一个动作之后，还要反复的进行检查：动作熟练不熟练，物质准备完善不完善。团里查过突击连队的准备，他们一声响亮的回答：“一切准备好了，只有等着徐老总（战士亲切的这样称呼着徐司令员）下攻击令。”
