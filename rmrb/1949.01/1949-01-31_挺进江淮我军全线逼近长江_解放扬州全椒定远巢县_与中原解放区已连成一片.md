Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, January 29th: The People's Liberation Army, advancing towards the north bank of the Yangtze River, liberated Yangzhou County, an important town on the outskirts of Nanjing, at 1:00 AM on the 25th. The defending enemy, the Fourth Army and the Fifty-first Army, fled south across the Yangtze River. On the same day, the People's Liberation Army liberated Quanjiao County, west of Pukou. All of the defending enemy security regiment, numbering over 1,600 men, were annihilated. In addition, the local armed forces of the Jianghuai Military Region liberated Dingyuan County, northwest of Chuxian, capturing the deputy commander of the enemy security regiment, Luo Zhengxiang, and 310 others. The People's Liberation Army, which began its advance into the Jianghuai region on the 12th, is now approaching the north bank of the Yangtze River on all fronts. The Kuomintang army from the Jinpu Railway to the East China Sea has been completely compressed into a narrow area along the Yangtze River from Pukou to Qidong. Its multiple ports, including Liuweigang, Zhanghuanggang, Shangtianshenggang, Xingang, and Jiuweigang, are now under the control of the People's Liberation Army. West of the Jinpu Railway, the People's Liberation Army has advanced to the line of Quanjiao, Hanshan, Chaoxian, Lujiang, Shucheng, and Zhuwumiao, leaving the Kuomintang army entrenched in only a few cities such as Susong, Taihu, Qianshan, Huaining, Tongcheng, Wuwei, and Hexian. In total, since the advance into the Jianghuai region began on the 12th, the People's Liberation Army has occupied 19 cities in 13 days, including Bengbu, Jiashan, Chuxian on the Jinpu Railway, Wuhe, Lai'an, Gaoyou, Yangzhou, Taixian east of the Jinpu Railway, and Huaiyuan, Fengtai, Fengyang, Dingyuan, Quanjiao, Hanshan, Chaoxian, Hefei, Shucheng, Lujiang, Zhuwumiao west of the Jinpu Railway. As a result, the Jianghuai Administrative Region of the East China Liberated Area is now connected to the Yu-Wan-Su and Wanxi Administrative Regions of the Central Plains Liberated Area. The Jianghuai Administrative Region and the Subei Administrative Region formerly belonged to the Su-Wan Liberated Area. This famous land of fish and rice was a stronghold of the anti-Japanese resistance for the people of southeastern China during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the People's Liberation Army, which had fought hard in the Su-Wan area, withdrew from southern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, and southern Anhui in order to seek domestic peace. However, this concession did not stop the aggressive Kuomintang reactionary government from attacking. In July 1946, when the Kuomintang reactionary government launched a full-scale counter-revolutionary war, it first concentrated 500,000 troops to attack the Su-Wan Liberated Area. The People's Liberation Army inflicted severe blows on the invading bandit army in the Su-Wan Liberated Area. At the end of 1946, the main force of the People's Liberation Army withdrew to Shandong, and the army and people of the Su-Wan Liberated Area continued to persevere in their heroic struggle, shattering countless brutal "sweeps" by the bandit army, until they turned to a victorious offensive. Now the People's Liberation Army has recovered most of the original Su-Wan Liberated Area north of the Yangtze River and has liberated many important cities that had never been liberated before, such as Bengbu, Hefei, Taizhou, and Yangzhou. Yangzhou, with a population of 150,000, is the largest city along the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu, only 40 li from the Yangtze River. Yangzhou was once the capital of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty, hence its other name, Jiangdu. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Shi Kefa failed to resist the Qing here and was martyred. The Qing army carried out a ten-day massacre, known as the "Ten Days of Yangzhou," a major bloodbath.

Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, January 28th: The People's Liberation Army, marching south from Hefei, occupied Chaoxian City, an important rice-producing area of ​​Anhui, at 12:00 PM on the 23rd. The defending enemy, the Eighty-first Division, fled south. The People's Liberation Army, advancing south along the Jinpu Railway, occupied Wuyi Town, northwest of Pukou, at 8:00 PM on the 24th. On the same day, another unit of the People's Liberation Army recovered Zhuwumiao (Yuexi) and Lujiang county towns in western Anhui. So far, except for seven or eight county towns along the Yangtze River, such as Hexian, Huaining, Susong, Quanjiao, Wuwei, and Qianshan, the entire province of Anhui north of the Yangtze River has been liberated.

Furthermore: It has been determined that the large iron bridge over the Huai River north of Bengbu was destroyed in the middle three spans by the war criminals during their retreat. Because the enemy used a large amount of explosives, the explosion caused great tremors, and many houses in Bengbu were collapsed. The Kuomintang bandit army fleeing south from Hefei also destroyed bridges along the way. The iron bridge north of Hefei and the iron bridges north and south of Xiatangji were severely damaged.

　　挺进江淮我军全线逼近长江
  　解放扬州全椒定远巢县
    与中原解放区已连成一片
    【新华社蚌埠二十九日电】向长江北岸挺进的解放军二十五日上午一时解放南京外围重镇扬州县城，守敌第四军、第五十一军渡江南逃。同日解放军解放了浦口以西的全椒县城，守敌保安团一千六百余人，全部××。此外，江淮军区解放军地方武装攻克了滁县西北的定远县城，俘敌保安团副团长罗正相以下三百一十人。合肥方面解放军二十四日攻克巢湖西之三河镇，歼敌地方反动武装四个中队。自十二日开始向江淮地区进军的解放军，现已全线逼近长江北岸。自津浦路至东海边的国民党军已完全被压缩在自浦口至启东沿江一线的狭窄地带，其××六圩港、张黄港、上天生港、新港、九圩港等多处口岸已为解放军控制。津浦路以西，解放军则进抵全椒、含山、巢县、庐江、舒城、朱屋庙一线，使国民党军局处于宿松、太湖、潜山、怀宁、桐城、无为、和县等少数城市。总计自十二日向江淮地区进军以来，十三天内，解放军占领了津浦线上的蚌埠、嘉山、滁县、津浦路以东的五河、来安、高邮、扬州、泰县，津浦路以西的怀远、凤台、凤阳、定远、全椒、含山、巢县、合肥、舒城、庐江、朱屋庙等十九座城市。因此，华东解放区的江淮行政区现已与中原解放区之豫皖苏、皖西两行政区连成一片。江淮行政区与苏北行政区前属苏皖解放区，这个著名的鱼米之乡在八年抗日战争中曾是中国东南部人民的抗日堡垒，日寇投降后，在苏皖地区苦战的人民解放军为了谋求国内和平，曾由苏南、浙东、皖南各地撤退，但是这种忍让并没有停止好战的国民党反动政府的进攻。一九四六年七月国民党反动政府在发动全面反革命战争时，首先就集中五十万兵力进攻苏皖解放军区。人民解放军在苏皖解放区给了进犯匪军以严重的打击。一九四六年底，人民解放军主力撤至山东，苏皖解放区军民仍继续坚持英勇的斗争，粉碎了匪军无数次残酷的扫荡，直至转入了胜利的进攻，现在人民解放军已经收复了原苏皖解放区在长江以北的绝大部分土地，并且解放了不少从未解放过的重要城市如蚌埠、合肥、泰州、扬州等。十五万人口的扬州，是苏北运河沿岸的最大城市，南距江边仅四十里。扬州一度是隋炀帝的行都，故又名江都。明清之际，史可法在此抗清失败殉难，清兵曾实行十天的大屠杀，即被称为“扬州十日”的大血案。
    【新华社蚌埠二十八日电】由合肥南下的解放军，二十三日晚十二时占领安徽重要产米区巢县城，守敌八十一师南逃。沿津浦路向南推进的解放军，二十四日晚八时占领浦口西北的乌衣镇。同日，另部解放军收复皖西朱屋庙（岳西）及庐江两县城。至此，长江以北的安徽省，除沿江的和县、怀宁、宿松及全椒、无为、潜山等七、八座县城外，已全部解放。
    又讯：蚌埠北淮河大铁桥经查明被战争罪犯们在撤退时炸毁中间三孔。因敌人所用炸药甚多，炸时震动极大，蚌市不少房屋被震坍。由合肥南逃的国民党匪军，亦将沿路桥梁炸毁，合肥北铁桥及下塘集南北铁桥，都遭到重大破坏。
