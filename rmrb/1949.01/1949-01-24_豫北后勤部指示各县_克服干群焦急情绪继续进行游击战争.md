　　Yubei Logistics Department Instructs All Counties
　　Overcome the Anxious Mood of Cadres and Masses and Continue Guerrilla Warfare
　　【Taihang Telegram】The Kuomintang bandit troops in Xinxiang and other places in northern Henan, facing their last desperate straits, took the opportunity around the New Year to collude with bandits and frantically looted grain in all directions. Our Yubei Logistics Command issued instructions to all counties under its jurisdiction on the 24th of last month to launch a border guerrilla war and vigorously prepare to participate in the war to support the front. The instructions stated: Our army is about to deal a devastating blow to the enemy, but at present, some areas are still in an environment of guerrilla warfare. Although this situation will not last long, in order to better cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the enemy troops, safeguard the interests of the masses in the border areas, and better carry out work in the new districts, all localities should pay special attention to this situation and carry out the following work. First, in terms of the ideology of cadres and the masses, it is necessary to recognize the characteristics of the current situation of the struggle against the enemy in northern Henan, and overcome the impatient mood of "one breath" of immediate success. Some places need to launch guerrilla warfare, organize the masses for war preparedness, and do a good job in supporting the front. Sometimes, in a certain area, one will be the main focus, or the two will be given equal emphasis. This is a very short-term but extremely arduous task of struggle, and full preparations must be made in the ideology of cadres and the masses before it is possible to do a good job in specific organizational work. In this situation, especially for the work of participating in the war and supporting the front, ideological and organizational preparations must be made over a relatively long period of time. Secondly, in areas where some enemies may temporarily sneak in, in addition to organizing the masses for necessary war preparedness, a widespread call should be made to the masses to organize armed self-defense. In general, villages should organize mass self-defense teams, establish sentry posts and intelligence, and mobilize the masses to regularly expose enemy spies and hidden enemy armed personnel. In villages with a certain work foundation, backbone armed forces should be further organized to organize joint defense villages. It is necessary to start from the masses' armed self-defense against looting, conscription, and sabotage, and overcome the right-leaning phenomenon of some cadres underestimating the self-defense demands of the masses in the new districts and not daring to call on and organize the masses for self-defense. Thirdly, the above-mentioned areas should specially organize armed work teams and demolition teams to provide strong support. Familiarize yourself well with the terrain in advance, contact the masses (in conjunction with carrying out local work), and combine armed activities to vigorously carry out political offensives, providing strong support for the local mass self-defense struggle against the enemy. The instructions finally stated that in order to strengthen the leadership of the above work, the command headquarters of each county must earnestly restore its organization and work, unify the leadership of the struggle against the enemy and the work of supporting the front, and closely link up and down.

　　豫北后勤部指示各县
  　克服干群焦急情绪继续进行游击战争
    【太行电】面临着穷途末路的豫北新乡等地国民党匪军，年关前后乘隙纠合土匪，四出疯狂抢粮。我豫北后勤司令部特于上月二十四日指示所属各县，开展边地游击战争，同时大力准备参战支前。指示称：我军即将给敌以歼灭打击，但现时若干地区，还是游击战争的环境。这种情况虽不会长久，但为了更好配合解放军痛歼敌军，维护边地群众利益，更好的开展新区工作，目前各地应特别注视这一形势，进行下述工作。首先在干部和群众思想上，要认识目前豫北对敌斗争的形势特点，克服“一口气”马上成功的急躁情绪。有些地方要开展游击战争，组织群众备战，又要做好支前工作。有时在一定地区内，会以一个为主，或二者同时并重。这是一个期限很短而又十分艰巨的斗争任务，必须在干部群众思想上充分作准备，才可能做好具体的组织工作。在此情况下，特别对参战支前工作，必须从较长时间的思想与组织作准备。其次，在若干敌人可能暂时窜扰到的地区，除组织群众必要的备战外，应广泛号召群众组织武装自卫。一般村里要组织群众性自卫队，建立岗哨、情报，发动群众经常检举敌奸细活动，与暗藏敌武装人员。在有一定工作基础的村，进一步组织骨干武装，组织联防村。要从群众反抢掠、反抓丁、反破坏等武装自卫出发，克服若干干部对新区群众自卫要求估计不足，而不敢号召与组织群众自卫的右倾现象。再次，上述地区要专门组织武工队、爆炸队，有力支援。事前很好熟悉地形，联系群众（结合开展当地工作），并结合武装活动，大力开展政攻，给当地群众性的自卫抗敌斗争以有力撑腰。指示最后称，为加强以上工作的领导，各县指挥部必须认真恢复机构与工作，统一对敌斗争与支前工作的领导，密切上下联系。
