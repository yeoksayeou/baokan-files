Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Reports from various sources: The British colonial authorities in Malaya, in the name of the "Malayan government," promulgated a "new emergency ordinance" on the 10th, which will massively massacre our overseas Chinese compatriots. The ordinance stipulates that any residents in so-called "bandit-affected" areas will be arrested and deported. According to the Associated Press, the aim of this ordinance is to "clear the residents from the jungle" in order to strangle the heroic and unyielding Malayan resistance movement. In order to divide the united anti-British front of the Malay, Chinese, and Indian nationalities in Malaya, the British cunningly and hypocritically announced that Malays would not be arrested. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 11th, less than six hours after the announcement of the new ordinance in Kuala Lumpur, British military police arrived in Kayang, 15 miles south of the city, surrounded the area, arrested more than 500 overseas Chinese, seized all livestock, and ordered the residents to leave. Prior to the announcement of this ordinance, the British colonial authorities were actually implementing this policy. According to a Reuter dispatch on the 5th, quoting the British "Daily Worker" from Kuala Lumpur: On December 12th last year, 25 Chinese rubber workers in Selangor were brutally murdered by British troops simply because they answered British officers that they had not seen the Communists. Their families were transported away in trucks, and their houses and furniture were set on fire. This barbaric, cruel, and bloody behavior of the British colonial imperialists in Malaya towards our overseas Chinese compatriots is arousing serious concern and indignation among the Chinese people and the local Malayan people. However, Li Qin, the Kuomintang bandit's consul-general in the Malay Federation, not only did not protest against this large-scale bloody incident of the British imperialists massacring our overseas Chinese compatriots, but openly sided with the British colonial authorities, demanding that overseas Chinese quickly "withdraw" to the so-called "safe zones."

　　马来亚英当局血腥统治
  　大规模残害我侨胞
  　正引起中国人民和当地人民的愤慨
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：马来亚英国殖民当局于十日以“马来亚政府”的名义，颁布了大规模残害我国侨胞的“新紧急条例”。该条例规定对所谓“匪患”地区的任何居民，将加以逮捕与驱逐出境。据合众社称，这一条例旨在“扫清丛林中的居民”，以图扼死英勇不屈的马来亚抵抗运动。为了分裂马来亚、华、印各民族反英统一战线，英国狡猾地虚伪地宣布对马来人，将不加逮捕。据合众社十一日电称，在吉隆坡，该新条例宣布以后不及六小时，英军警即开抵该城以南十五哩的加央地方，将该地团团包围，捕走华侨五百余人，抢走所有牲畜，并勒令居民离开该地。在这一条例宣布之前，英国殖民当局实际上早在执行这种政策。据电通社五日电引英国工人日报自吉隆坡报导：去年十二月十二日，雪兰莪州有二十五个华侨树胶工人，仅因回答英国军官没有看见共产党，即被英军残杀。他们的家眷被用卡车运走，房屋家私全被纵火焚烧。马来亚英国殖民帝国主义者对我国侨胞这种野蛮的残酷的血腥行为，正引起中国人民和当地马来亚人民严重的关切与愤慨。但是，蒋匪驻马来联邦总领事李琴对英帝国主义者这种大规模残害我国侨胞的血腥事件，不仅不表示抗议，反而公开站在英国殖民当局方面，要求华侨迅速“撤退”至所谓“安全地带”。
