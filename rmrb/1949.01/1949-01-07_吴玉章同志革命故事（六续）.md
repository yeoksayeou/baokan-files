　　The Failure of the Great Revolution

　　Since the establishment of the Wuhan government, the revolutionary situation had reached an unprecedented high, with the workers' and peasants' movements making particularly rapid progress. The number of organized workers exceeded three million, and the membership of peasant associations exceeded ten million. The peasant movement in Hunan was the most developed, with the establishment of peasant's own political power in the countryside, the disappearance of bandits and beggars, no one picking up lost articles, and no need to lock doors at night. However, just as the revolution was winning victory after victory, the high-pressure and divisive policies of imperialism were put into effect.

　　First, when the revolutionary army captured Nanjing, the imperialist warships shelled Nanjing to threaten the revolution. Secondly, they took advantage of the dispute between Nanchang and Wuhan, colluding with elements within the revolution who defected halfway to divide the revolutionary forces from within. Chiang Kai-shek, upon receiving the news of the capture of Nanjing, went from Nanchang to Shanghai on March 25, 1927, instigating hooligans to destroy the left-wing Kuomintang party headquarters along the way in Jiujiang and Anqing, and sending people to Chongqing to organize the March 31st Massacre. On April 12, he launched a coup in Shanghai, closing down trade unions, massacring a large number of workers and Communists, and establishing a counter-revolutionary government in Nanjing to confront the Wuhan government.

　　In early April, the opportunistic politician Wang Jingwei returned to Shanghai from the Soviet Union and secretly met with Chiang Kai-shek and Wu Zhihui. Wu scolded Wang, who then sobbed, "I am also anti-communist, but my methods are different." From then on, Wang Jingwei returned to Wuhan and was effectively a spy in the revolutionary camp.

　　The strength of the Wuhan government previously lay in the resoluteness and steadfastness of the revolutionary leaders at the time. However, after Chen Duxiu issued the Wang-Chen Declaration in Shanghai with Wang Jingwei in early April and came to Wuhan together, this shameful capitulationist obeyed this spy in everything. Wang said that the peasant movement had gone too far, and Chen convened cadres to issue orders, saying that the peasant movement had gone too far. On May 21, Xu Kexiang launched a coup in Changsha, massacring many workers and peasants. On May 31, tens of thousands of Hunan peasants angrily attacked Changsha. Wang said that peasants were not allowed to attack, and Chen quickly issued an order forbidding peasants to attack. The Fourth Army was originally indifferent to the separation of communists, but Wang incited them every day, and some generals wavered.

　　On July 14, Wang Jingwei and others held a secret meeting and passed a resolution on separating the communists, but still claimed to overthrow Chiang. Hu Hanmin wrote to him, saying: "To oppose the communists while still opposing Chiang is like uniting with the communists while overthrowing Wang. Could there be anything more ridiculous in the world?" This hit the nail on the head, revealing the true intentions of this group of traitors to Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

　　At this secret anti-communist meeting, Madam Sun did not attend, but sent Chen Youren to represent her, who pointed out painfully that cooperation with the Communist Party was a policy personally established by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and that since cooperation, the revolution had made great progress, and therefore opposed the separation of the communists. Her opinion aroused fierce debate. And Wang Jingwei was the leader who opposed this opinion. Comrade Wu Yuzhang learned of this news and realized that Wang was already a spy. To this day, he still deeply regrets that his revolutionary vigilance was insufficient at the time.

　　At one o'clock that night, Comrade Wu Yuzhang received news of this meeting and immediately returned to his residence, unable to sleep for a long time, cooling off on the balcony at two or three o'clock. Later, he saw a person come to the gate with four soldiers. Four or five minutes later, they entered through the back building, took down the telephone, and left a letter. The letter said that the situation outside was very tense, advising Comrade Wu Yuzhang to avoid it, unsigned. Comrade Wu Yuzhang discussed with Deng Maoxiu, who lived with him, and moved to another place.

　　Early the next morning, Comrade Wu Yuzhang originally wanted to go to Wuchang to take refuge temporarily. Later, he thought that he alone was in charge of the Kuomintang Central Party Department, and the accounts had not been handed over, fearing that the reactionaries would take the opportunity to create rumors and slanders. So at nine o'clock, he went to the Central Party Department, left a letter to Wang Jingwei saying that in this situation, he could no longer stay here, and handed over the seals and accounts clearly.

　　On August 1st, Ye Ting and He Long launched the Nanchang Uprising. Comrades Wu Yuzhang, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, Liu Bocheng, and others all participated. Comrade Wu Yuzhang served as a member and secretary-general of the Revolutionary Committee. He followed the army to fight in Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. In October, after the defeat in the Tangkeng battle in Chaoshan, a meeting was held in Liusha, and it was decided to assign cadres to various places. Comrades Wu Yuzhang, Lin Boqu, Liu Bocheng, and others transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and then went to the Soviet Union.

　　In the Soviet Union

　　While studying in the special class of the Moscow Chinese Labor Communist University, Comrade Wu Yuzhang, although already fifty-one years old, was still a very diligent student. The economics professor said that in the whole class, Comrade Wu Yuzhang and Qian Yishi had a deep understanding of Das Kapital. He also studied dialectical materialism and Leninism very diligently. Marx said: "Theory, as soon as it grips the masses, becomes a material force." Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." Comrade Wu Yuzhang, reading these words, deeply felt the importance of studying theory, and he firmly believed in the truth of dialectical materialism. He often adhered to the principle of: using dialectics to observe things, not only paying attention to the mutual connection and mutual restriction of things, but also paying attention to the movement, change, and development of things. Therefore, according to dialectics, the most important thing is not what seems solid and powerful at the moment, but is actually beginning to corrupt and die, but what is growing and developing, even if it seems very immature and not very powerful at the moment, it cannot be defeated. From this, Comrade Wu Yuzhang determined that outdated and decadent feudalism and dying imperialism and fascism would inevitably die, that the national democratic revolution led by the brand-new Chinese Communist Party would inevitably win, and that when the time was right, a socialist society would inevitably arrive. Comrade Wu Yuzhang also used dialectics to study ancient Chinese philosophical books such as the Book of Changes, and he found that they contained some dialectical elements. In the special class, Comrade Wu Yuzhang's academic performance was the best.

　　After graduating in 1930, Comrade Wu Yuzhang went to Vladivostok as a teacher at the Far East Workers' Leninism School. In 1931, based on a draft prepared by Comrade Qu Qiubai in the Soviet Union, Comrade Wu Yuzhang and some scholars studying philology in the Soviet Union formulated a Latinization plan for Chinese characters.

　　Comrade Wu Yuzhang gave a speech on the Latinization movement in Vladivostok, and a professor named Hanski stood up to oppose it, saying that Oriental writing was very good, and Chinese characters were especially good. This was the same as Hu Shi's argument in the Shengjing Times that Chinese characters were sacred characters. But Comrade Wu Yuzhang refuted him and insisted on experimental implementation. The result proved that Chinese workers at that time learned very quickly and could use the new writing in a few months. While they worked hard for experimentation and promotion, they also did not simply think that Chinese characters could be abandoned quickly. In the "Principles and Rules of the Chinese Latinized New Writing" passed at the First Congress of Chinese New Writing Representatives convened by Chinese workers in Vladivostok on September 26, 1931, there was such a clause: "The Congress believes that language and writing develop with the economic and political development of society. It certainly requires human promotion, but it also has necessary processes and steps. Therefore, the implementation of the new writing does not mean immediately abolishing Chinese characters, but gradually promoting the new writing to the lives of the masses, and only when the time is right can Chinese characters be abolished." Therefore, on the issue of reforming writing, we must oppose conservative right-wing views on the one hand, and prevent "left" views that are divorced from reality and the masses on the other.

　　In 1935, Japanese bandits became increasingly tyrannical, and the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people across the country rose. Our party issued the August 1 Declaration, calling on the whole country to unite to resist Japan. Comrade Wu Yuzhang went to Paris to run the "National Salvation Times" to publicize the anti-Japanese national united front. In 1936, he returned to Moscow to work as a teacher in the Chinese Department of the Oriental University, wanting to organize Chinese history from a Marxist point of view, and according to the method of writing history advocated by Stalin, used chronological narratives of historical figures and facts. Zhang Taiyan lamented that India had no history, and it was difficult to study Indian culture, and praised Confucius for creating the Spring and Autumn Annals to create chronology. Comrade Wu Yuzhang also believed that there should be definite time, place, name, and facts before it can become a true history representing the development process of mankind, rather than legends or scattered stories.

　　Regarding new writing and history, Comrade Wu Yuzhang has works such as "The Origin and Reform Plan of Chinese Characters," "The New Grammar of Chinese New Writing," "Chinese History Tutorial," and "The Significance of Studying History."

　　This shows that Comrade Wu Yuzhang is not only a heroic and resolute revolutionary practitioner, but also a person who has studied revolutionary theory and Chinese academics. (End of this section, to be continued)

　　吴玉章同志革命故事（六续）
    何其芳
  　大革命失败
    武汉政府成立以来，革命形势空前高涨，工农运动尤为突飞猛进。有组织的工人超过了三百万，农民协会的会员有一千多万，湖南农民运动最为发达，乡村建立了农民自己的政权，盗匪乞丐绝迹，道不拾遗，夜不闭户。但正当革命着着胜利的时候，帝国主义的高压政策与分化政策就拿出来了。
    首先是革命军攻下南京时，帝国主义的军舰就炮击南京以威胁革命。其次又利用南昌与武汉之争，勾结革命内部半途叛变的分子，从内部来分化革命力量。蒋介石得到攻下南京的消息，即于一九二七年三月二十五日从南昌到上海，沿途在九江安庆嗾使流氓捣毁左派国民党的党部，并派人到重庆组织三、三一大屠杀。四月十二日，他又在上海举行政变，封闭工会，屠杀大批工人和共产党员，并在南京成立反革命的政府与武汉政府对立。
    四月初，投机政客汪精卫从苏联回上海，即偷偷与蒋介石，吴稚晖会面。吴大骂汪，汪即哭诉道：“我也是反共，不过方法不同而已。”从这以后，汪精卫回武汉，就实际是一个革命阵营的奸细了。
    武汉政府以前之有力量，主要在于当时的革命领导者很坚决，不动摇。但等到四月初，陈独秀在上海与汪精卫发表汪陈宣言，并一同来武汉后，这个可耻的投降主义者却一切都顺从这个奸细。汪说农民运动过火了，陈也就召集干部发布命令，说农民运动过火。五月二十一日，长沙许克祥举行政变，屠杀了许多工农。五月三十一日，湖南数万农民愤而进攻长沙。汪说不许农民进攻，陈也就赶快下命令不许农民进攻。第四军本来是不顾分共的，汪天天去煽动，有些将领也就动摇了。
    七月十四日，汪精卫等举行秘密会议，通过了分共的议决案，但仍标榜要打倒蒋。胡汉民写信给他说：“反共犹须反蒋，则联共尚须倒汪，天下滑稽之事宁有过于此耶？”这倒是一语道破了这一批孙中山先生的叛徒的真心思。
    在这秘密反共会议上，孙夫人没有出席，但派陈友仁代表她讲话，很沉痛地指出与共产党合作是中山先生亲自所订的政策，并且合作以来革命有了很大发展，因此反对分共。她的意见引起了激烈的争论。而汪精卫就是反对这种意见的领导人。吴玉章同志听见了这样的消息，才知道汪已经是一个奸细。至今他还深悔他当时的革命警惕性不够。
    这天晚上一点钟，吴玉章同志得到了这个会议的消息，马上回寓，很久不能入睡，两三点钟还在晒台上歇凉。后来见有一个人带了四个兵士来到了大门口。四五分钟后，他们由后楼入内，取下电话，并留一信。信上说外面风声很紧，劝吴玉章同志避开，未署名，吴玉章同志与同住的邓懋修商量，移住另一地方。
    次日清早，吴玉章同志本想即往武昌暂避。后又想，他一人管国民党中央党部，帐目未交，恐反动派借此造谣诬蔑。于是九时到中央党部，留信告汪精卫说，似此情形，不能再留在这里，并把印信帐目都交代清楚。
    八月一日叶挺贺龙在南昌起义，吴玉章同志、朱德同志、周恩来同志、林伯渠同志、刘伯承同志等都参加了。吴玉章同志任革命委员会委员兼秘书长。随军转战江西、广东、福建。十月在潮汕汤坑一战挫败，在流沙开会，决定将干部分派各地。吴玉章同志、林伯渠、刘伯承等同志由港转沪，遂赴苏联。
    在苏联
    在莫斯科中国劳动共产主义大学特别班学习时，吴玉章同志虽年已五十一岁，仍是一个很用功的学生。经济学教授说全班算吴玉章同志和钱亦石两个对于资本论有深刻的了解。对辩证唯物论，列宁主义，也很用功学习。马克思说：“理论只要一掌握群众，就立刻成为物质的力量。”列宁说：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”吴玉章同志读着这些话，深深感到了学习理论的重要，他坚信辩证唯物论的真理。他常常服膺的是：用辩证法来观察事物，不但要注意事物的互相联系和互相制约，而且要注意事物的运动变化，发展。因此，依辩证法看来，最重要的不是那在目前似乎坚固，有力，但实际已开始腐化死亡的东西，而是那正在生长着和正在发展着的东西，即使它在目前还似乎很幼稚，不是很强大的，但却是不可被战胜的。从这，吴玉章同志就断定，过时的腐朽的封建主义和垂死的帝国主义，法西斯主义必然要死亡，崭新的中国共产党领导的民族民主革命必然要胜利，而到了适当的时候，社会主义社会也必然要到来。吴玉章同志又用辩证法去研究中国古代的哲学书籍如易经等，他发现它们当中含有一些辩证法的因素。在特别班中，吴玉章同志的学习成绩最好。
    一九三○年毕业后，吴玉章同志到海参威作远东工人列宁主义学校教员。一九三一年，以瞿秋白同志在苏联时所拟的草案为基础，吴玉章同志和苏联一些研究文字学的学者制订了中国字拉丁化方案。
    吴玉章同志在海参威作拉丁化运动讲演，一个叫汉斯基的教授起来反对，说东方文字很好，中国字尤其好。这和当时盛京时报上胡适说中国文字是神圣文字的论调相同。但吴玉章同志把他驳倒，仍坚持实验推行，结果证明当时中国工人学起来很快，几个月就会运用新文字。他们一方面为实验，推行而努力，但同时也并不是简单地认为汉字很快就可以废弃。一九三一年九月二十六日，海参威中国工人召集的中国新文字第一次代表大会上所通过的“中国拉丁化新文字的原则和规则”中，就有这样一条：“大会认为语言文字是随着社会的经济政治的发展而发展。它当然要有人力的推动，但它也有必经的过程和步骤。因此实行新文字并不是立刻废除汉字，而是逐渐把新文字推行到大众生活中去，到了适当的时候，才能取消汉字。”因此，在这个改革文字的问题上，我们一方面要反对保守的右的观点，一方面也要防止脱离实际脱离群众的“左”的观点。
    一九三五年，日寇日益横暴，全国民众抗日情绪高涨，我党发布八一宣言，号召全国团结抗日。吴玉章同志到巴黎办“救国时报”，宣传抗日民族统一战线。一九三六年，回莫斯科作东方大学中国部教员，想以马克思主义的观点整理中国历史，并依照斯大林提倡的写历史的方法，用编年叙述历史人物与事实，从前章太炎痛心印度无历史，研究印度文化很感困难，而推崇孔子作春秋创编年纪事法。吴玉章同志亦认为应有确实的时间、地点、人名、事实，然后才能成为真正表示人类发展过程的历史，而不是传说，或零星故事。
    关于新文字与历史，吴玉章同志有“中国文字的源流及其改革的方案”，“中国新文字的新文法”，“中国史教程”，“研究历史的意义”等著作。
    这说明吴玉章同志不仅是一个英勇坚决的革命实行家，并且是一个对革命理论与中国学术都有研究的人。（本节完，全文未完）
