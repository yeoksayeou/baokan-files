　　March of the World Federation of Democratic Youth
　　Chen Jiakang
　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth was founded in London, England in the winter of 1945, and its headquarters were established in Paris, France in the spring of the following year. The headquarters is located on the fourth floor of a building at the southern end of the Rue de Chateaudun. The rooms are small and a bit crowded, which doesn't quite match this international youth organization with 50 million members. However, youth representatives from all over the world will have many new feelings here. Here, people will find gifts from the youth of many industrial countries – model trains, model ships, models of various machine parts, and works of art carved from coal by young miners. These things not only signify the shift in the lives and emotions of modern world youth, but also, in the face of this industrial art, even the sculptures of ancient Rome and the paintings of France pale in comparison.

　　Revolutionaries all over the world have endless nostalgia for mimeograph machines, especially during the era of underground work in the early stages of revolution. Today, the youth representatives from various countries gathered at the headquarters of the WFDY are no exception. That newest automatic rotary mimeograph machine has become everyone's darling. It is running from morning till night, constantly emitting rhythmic sounds, and printing at high speed information about the youth movements in various countries around the world, including the solidarity and struggle of Polish youth, the great achievements of Soviet youth in the post-war five-year plan, and the epic of Chinese youth fighting against the impact of airplanes and cannons and the Kuomintang bandits and their master American imperialism in the People's Liberation War, and the groans and roars of Indian youth. At the same time, it uses fresh ink to print various resolutions, instructions, and notices of the WFDY. These documents, in a firm tone, call on young people all over the world to fight against the conspiracy of imperialism and reactionaries to create a new world war, to fight for peace and democracy, and to support the cause of liberation of young people in Spain, Greece, China, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

　　Now, we want to make a pilgrimage to the core leadership of the WFDY – the Secretariat. The Secretariat's office is a bright and large room; however, it is not decorated, and the most noticeable thing may be the row of orange-green metal filing cabinets composed of many large drawers. There are four large desks in the entire room, which are the seats of Ivan, the representative of Bulgaria, William, the representative of Australia, Vasily, the representative of the Soviet Union, and the representative of the Chinese Liberated Area. The chairman of the WFDY is a French representative named Guidiboisson, tall, twenty-eight or nine years old, and a member of the French Communist Party's National Assembly. His seat is not in the Secretariat's office. He has a small, separate room. When there are discussions and meetings, he goes to the Secretariat's office to participate in collective leadership.

　　Ten o'clock in the morning is the busiest time of the day for the Secretariat. All official documents, letters, telegrams, magazines, and newspapers, these youth documents written in various languages and sent from every corner of the world, are concentrated in the Secretariat. The Australian representative, a youth from a mining family who serves as the Administrative Secretary and Minister of Organization, becomes a busy person at this time. He constantly reviews various documents and reports important events of the day to the representatives of various countries in the Secretariat, including some people's democratic countries planning to organize international construction teams. Requesting the WFDY to mobilize young people from various countries to participate; some democratic youth in Spain and Greece were sentenced to death by their fascist governments, requesting the WFDY to protest and rescue; some American democratic youth reported: explaining that the reactionary policies of American monopoly capitalists are intensifying, and the democratic movement is increasingly ravaged, so that youth work is not easy to carry out; some British democratic youth sent letters, listing developments, requiring close attention to be paid to the conspiracies of bourgeois reactionary youth and social democratic right-wing youth.

　　Whenever the Australian representative's oral report is in progress, the Minister of Propaganda, the Canadian female representative Jessie, comes in to report on the editing and printing of the WFDY's organ magazine "World Youth," or to urge the Secretariat's representatives to quickly review the editorials. The Minister of Travel, the British female representative Hockman, may take this opportunity to report: Some reactionary governments in capitalist countries refuse to issue entry permits or transit permits to some democratic youth. The Minister of Youth Needs, the Polish representative, sometimes also expresses opinions on youth welfare issues. Only the work of the Minister of Colonial Affairs, the Indian representative Yuanji, is the most onerous, because there are many colonies in the capitalist world system. He not only has to worry about the youth movements in the colonial countries of Southeast Asia, and maintain regular contact with the youth of Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia, he also has to preside over the opening up of new work in the colonial countries of the Near East and Africa. However, there is also one thing that makes this young Indian representative beaming. This is when his gaze turns from the various maps hanging on the wall and slowly falls on the map of the Middle East Liberated Area, the representatives of various countries stationed in the WFDY unanimously agree that it is really exciting in China, and the People's Liberation Army is winning victory after victory.

　　The representatives of the WFDY Secretariat must cultivate internationalist thinking from their daily work. They must understand that the nature of each country is different, the characteristics of each nation are different, and they must understand that the stages of revolutionary development of these countries and nations are different. The representatives of the Secretariat must always guard against all conspiracies and tricks of the American and British imperialist groups. Then, they can formulate plans for various international youth conferences. Formulate plans on how to form and dispatch international youth delegations. The task of the WFDY is to mobilize the advanced youth all over the world, to win over the middle and backward youth all over the world, to organize them, to unite them, and to become an international youth front against imperialism and fighting for lasting peace and people's democracy.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth is moving forward, and the China Liberated Area Youth Federation, as one of the founding member groups of the WFDY, is moving forward. Let us fight for the liberation of the youth of the whole of China, and fight for the liberation of the youth of the whole world.

　　世界民主青年联合会前进曲
    陈家康
    世界民主青年联合会是一九四五年冬天在英国伦敦成立的，次年春天在法国巴黎成立了总部。总部位置在夏朵当路南头的一座大厦的四层楼上，房间少，拥挤一点，与这个拥有五千万会员的国际青年组织，不大相称。然而，从世界各国来的青年代表们，在这里会有许多新的感受。在这里，人们会发现许多工业国家青年送来的礼物——火车模型，轮船模型，各种机器零件的模型，以及青年矿工们用煤块雕刻出来的艺术品。这些东西不但意味着现代世界青年的生活与情感，有了转移，同时在这种工业艺术的面前，恐怕连古罗马的浮雕和法兰西的绘画，也要黯然失色。
    全世界的革命者，当在革命初期，特别是在地下工作时代，对于油印机，都有无穷的眷恋。今天团集在世青联总部的各国青年代表也不能例外。那一架最新式的自动转筒油印机成了大家的宠儿。它从早到晚开动着，它不断发出有音律的声响，它以高速度印出世界各国青年运动的资料，其中包括波兰青年的团结与斗争，苏联青年在战后五年计划中的丰功伟绩，中国青年在人民解放战争中冒着飞机大炮的冲击和国民党匪帮及其主子美帝国主义作斗争的史诗，印度青年的呻吟与纳喊。同时，它又用新鲜的墨迹印出世青联的各种决议、指示、与通告。这些文件以坚决不移的口吻，号召全世界青年为反对帝国主义和反动派制造新世界战争的阴谋而斗争，为和平与民主而斗争，为支援西班牙、希腊、中国、越南，印度尼西亚青年的解放事业而斗争。
    现在，我们要向世青联的领导核心——秘书处，作一次巡礼。秘书处的办公室是一间明亮的大房间；但是，并无装饰，最惹人注意的也许只是那一排橘绿色的金属的由许多大抽屉组成的档案柜子。全室有四张大的办公桌子，那是保加利亚代表依凡、澳大利亚（澳洲）代表威廉、苏联代表华西利和中国解放区代表的座位。世青联的主席是一位法国代表，名叫基德波松，高个儿，二十八九岁，法国共产党的国会议员。他的座位不在秘书处的办公室，他有一间小的单独的屋子，如有讨论和会议时，他就到秘书处的办公室参加集体领导。
    早上十点钟，这是一天当中秘书处最忙的时候，一切公文、信件、电报、杂志、报纸，这些用各种文字写的，由世界各个角落里发来的青年文献，都集中到秘书处来了。作为行政秘书兼组织部长的澳大利亚的代表，一位由矿工家庭出身的青年，这时成了忙人，他不断的批阅各种文件，同时，要把当天的重要事件，向秘书处的各国代表作扼要的报告，其中有的是人民民主国家青年计划组织国际建设纵队。要求世青联动员各国青年参加；有的是西班牙和希腊的民主青年被他们的法西斯政府判处死刑，要求世青联抗议和营救；有的是美国民主青年的报告：说明美国独占资本家的反动政策加紧，民主运动日受摧残，以致青年工作不容易开展；有的是英国民主青年来函，列举动态，要求对资产阶级反动青年和社会民主党右派青年的阴谋，加以密切注意。
    每每当澳大利亚代表的口头报告正在进行之际，宣传部长加拿大的女代表杰西进来了，报告世青联的机关杂志“世界青年”的编印情况，或者催促秘书处的代表们赶快审查社论。旅行部长英国女代表何克曼也许趁此时赶来报告：有些资本主义国家的反动政府拒绝签发某些民主青年的入境证，或过境证。青年需要部长波兰代表有时也要陈述关于青年福利问题的意见。唯有殖民地部长印度代表远吉的工作最繁重，因为在资本主义的世界体系中，殖民地很多，他不但要为东南亚的殖民地国家的青年运动焦心，要和越南、缅甸、印度尼西亚的青年保持经常联系，他还要主持在近东、在非洲的殖民地国家中，开辟新的工作。然而也有一件事情使得这位年青的印度代表眉飞色舞，这就是当他的视线从挂在墙上的各项地图转过，慢慢落在中东解放区地图上的时候，驻在世青联的各国代表一致同意，在中国，真令人兴奋，人民解放军节节胜利。
    世青联秘书处的代表们，从他们的日常工作中必须养成合乎国际主义的思想，他们必须了解各个国家的性质不同，各个民族的特点不同，必须了解这些国家民族的革命发展阶段不同。秘书处的代表们必须时刻提防美英帝国主义集团的一切阴谋诡计。然后，他们才能制定各种国际青年会议的计划。制定如何组成如何派遣国际青年代表团的计划。世青联的任务是要动员全世界的先进青年，争取全世界的中间青年和落后青年，把他们组织起来，团结起来，成为一条反对帝国主义，为持久和平和人民民主而斗争的国际青年战线。
    世界民主青年联合会正在前进着，作为最初建立世青联的会员团体之一的中国解放区青年联合会正在前进着。让我们为解放全中国的青年而斗争，为解放全世界的青年而斗争。
