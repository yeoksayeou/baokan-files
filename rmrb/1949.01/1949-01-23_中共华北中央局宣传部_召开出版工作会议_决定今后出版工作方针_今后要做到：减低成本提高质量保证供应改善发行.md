[本报讯] The North China area's publishing work has achieved certain successes and progress in the past six months. The North China Xinhua Bookstore has published 46 new books (excluding magazines, party publications, loose-leaf documents, etc.), totaling approximately 200,000 copies (excluding reprints). In addition to reprinting books from the North China Xinhua Bookstore, the Taihang, Taiyue, Ji'nan, and Ji-Lu-Yu Xinhua Bookstores have compiled and published more than 20 types of their own (all local literary works and popular pamphlets). Popular publications "Plain" and "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" have been re-released. "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" sells more than 10,000 copies per issue (8,000 long-term subscribers). The editing and review process has basically overcome the chaotic phenomenon of anarchy and lack of discipline. However, there are still significant shortcomings in the work. First and foremost, the bookstore's supply cannot meet demand. Not only can school textbooks not meet the needs, but even basic books for cadres are often unavailable. Often, a book (such as "A Concise History of Social Development," etc.) is already allocated to pre-purchasers before it leaves the factory. The high price of books is a common complaint, and in some places, primary school children are dropping out of school because they cannot afford books. The bookstore's management has not truly implemented the policy of enterprise management, lacking precise calculations and defined systems, resulting in widespread waste. The North China Xinhua Bookstore once scrapped as many as 50,000 copies of primary school Chinese textbooks. The distribution work is also not done well enough, leading to the unreasonable contradiction of bookstores stockpiling many textbooks on one hand, while the masses cannot buy textbooks on the other.

In order to strengthen and improve the publishing and distribution work in the entire region, the North China Bureau Propaganda Department held a publishing work conference for the entire region on December 25th of last year. Responsible comrades from the North China Xinhua Bookstore and Xinhua Bookstores in various districts attended the meeting. In addition, relevant personnel from the People's Daily, Shijiazhuang Daily, Beiyue Daily, the Political Department of the Military Region, and the Government Education Department also participated. After three days of discussion, the following major issues were determined: First, it was recognized that publishing work is increasingly occupying an important position in the Party's propaganda work and the country's cultural construction, and all regions must strengthen their leadership over publishing work. The bookstore's business policy was determined as: reduce costs, improve quality, ensure supply, and improve distribution. (1) To reduce costs, it is necessary to earnestly implement the policy of enterprise management, overcome the "bureaucratic" style, and start from precise calculations, resolutely eliminating waste. It is necessary to strengthen the planning of publishing work and establish strict management systems, overcoming all disorganized and undisciplined chaos. The bookstore aims to serve the Party's propaganda work and the country's cultural construction and should not pursue profits, adhering to the principle of maintaining real material cost (calculated by paper, lead type, and millet) to sustain reproduction. (2) To improve quality, proofreading must be accurate, and proofreading should not be regarded as purely technical work; political responsibility should be taken for typographical errors. Inspection of publications during this period has revealed many serious errors, which must be practically and responsibly corrected in the future. In addition, it must be ensured that there is no cutting corners and that printing is clear and beautiful. (3) Ensuring supply primarily means ensuring books for cadre study and textbooks for primary and secondary schools. Before the spring semester begins, bookstores in various districts should focus on reprinting textbooks. Bookstores in newly liberated cities urgently need books (such as Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," and collections of Party policies, etc.), and bookstores in various districts should reprint them according to needs and possibilities, especially the North China Xinhua Bookstore, which should strive to resolve the contradiction between supply and demand. (4) Strengthen the existing distribution network, first ensuring that textbooks can be distributed in a timely manner. Branch stores in various locations should be appropriately adjusted, such as canceling one of the two branch stores in one location. At the same time, cultural cooperatives, post offices, schools, and private bookstores in various counties should be widely used, and book vendors and primary school teachers should be organized to sell on consignment. In the future, distribution workers should establish the idea that serving readers is serving the people. The bad practices of treating bookstores as government offices, sitting at home waiting for customers, and lacking enthusiasm for readers must be vigorously overcome in the future.

　　中共华北中央局宣传部
  　召开出版工作会议
    决定今后出版工作方针
    今后要做到：减低成本提高质量保证供应改善发行
    【本报讯】华北区的出版工作，半年来已获一定成绩和进步。华北新华书店出版新书四十六本（还有杂志、党刊，活叶文件等尚未计入），约计二十万册（重版书未计在内），小学课本印行一百七十万册。太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫四区新华书店除翻印华北新华书店的书以外，自己编印出版的共有二十余种（都是地方性的文艺作品、通俗小册子）。通俗刊物“平原”、“工农兵”先后复刊。“工农兵”每期销行一万多份（长期定户八千份）。编辑审查上基本上克服了无政府无纪律的混乱现象。但工作中的缺点还是很大的，首先是书店出货供不应求。不但学校教科书不能满足需要，而且干部的基本用书也经常买不到。往往一种书籍（如“社会发展简史”等）未出工厂就已分配预购者。书价贵，这是普遍的呼声，有的地方小学儿童因买不起书而辍学。书店管理没有真正实行企业化的方针，没有精确的计算，没有一定的制度，浪费的现象相当普遍，华北新华书店曾印废小学国语课本五万册之多。发行工作上也做的不够好，以致造成了一方面书店积压课本很多，而另一方面群众买不到课本的很不合理的矛盾现象。
    为加强与改进全区出版发行工作，华北局宣传部特于去年十二月二十五日召开全区的出版工作会议，到会的有华北新华书店以及各区新华书店的负责同志，此外人民日报社、石家庄日报社、北狱日报社、军区政治部宣传部、政府教育部也派有关人员参加。经过三天讨论，确定了以下几个主要问题：首先认定出版工作在当前党的宣传事业与国家文化建设上已日益占着重要的位置，各地必须加强对出版工作的领导。关于书店经营方针确定为：减低成本、提高质量、保证供应、改善发行。（一）要做到减低成本，必须切实执行企业化的方针，克服“机关化”作风，一切应从精确计算出发，坚决消灭浪费。必须加强出版工作上的计划性与建立严格的管理制度，克服一切无组织无纪律的混乱状态。书店以服务党的宣传工作与国家文化建设为目的，不能追求利润，以做到实物保本（以纸张、铅字、小米计算）维持再生产为原则。（二）提高质量应做到校对精确，不要把校对单纯看作技术工作，出了错字要负政治上的责任。检查这一时期的出版物已发现了许多严重的错误，今后必须切实负责改正。此外必须做到不偷工减料，印刷清楚美观。（三）保证供应首先是保证干部学习用书及中小学课本，春季开学前各区书店应突击翻印课本。新解放城市迫切需要的书籍（如毛主席的“新民主主义论”、“论联合政府”以及党的政策文集等），各区书店都应按着需要与可能加以翻印，尤其是华北新华书店更应努力解决供求矛盾的问题。（四）加强现有的发行网，首先保证课本能及时发下去。各地分店适当加以调整，如一地有两处分店者，应撤消其一。同时应广泛利用各县文化合作社、邮局、学校及私营书店，并组织书贩及小学教员代销。发行工作者今后应树立为读者服务就是为人民服务的思想。把书店当成机关，坐在家里等顾客上门，对读者缺乏热情，这一些不良的作风，今后必须用大力去克服。
