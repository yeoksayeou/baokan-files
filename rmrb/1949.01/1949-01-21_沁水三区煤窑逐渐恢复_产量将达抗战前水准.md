[Taiyue Electric Dispatch] The coal mines in the Qingshui Third District, which numbered twenty-six before the War of Resistance, employed 535 workers, and produced 600,000 catties of coal daily. After being ravaged by the Japanese puppets, most of them ceased operation. In recent years, with the support of our democratic government, they have gradually recovered. However, some mine owners still do not understand our policy of developing industry, or because the coal produced cannot be sold, they no longer mine in large quantities. For example, in the winter before last, although there were twenty-eight coal mines, there were only 342 workers, and they only produced 386,000 catties of coal daily, far from the pre-war level. After the winter production work was arranged last winter, comrades from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce went deep into the coal mining areas, held meetings of coal mine managers, patiently explained the policies, and helped solve difficulties such as sales channels. In one month, the coal industry has developed rapidly. The Shitan Kiln in Xiayu initially had only ten workers. After this meeting, the kiln owners Han Yu-gui and Wang Wen-yu took charge of the operation, and now it has developed to thirty-two workers, producing 43,200 catties of coal daily. Wang Yu-zhu, the manager of the Gongtan Kiln, did not understand the government's call for "integration of production, transportation, and sales" in the past. He said: "Since Pangu, Jixian carts have never come to Qingshui to haul coal." He was afraid that he would not be able to sell what he mined. But since the Qingshui-Jiangxian Avenue was opened in October, many Jiangxian carts have come to Qingshui to carry coal, and he hurriedly went to various places to find more than 20 workers to expand mining. The Xintan Kiln and Zhuanggou Kiln in Shangyu, the Xigou Kiln in Xingyu, the Guandi Kiln in Yaodu, and the Taishang Kiln in Yenei are all old kilns that have been closed for several years or even decades. They have now been reopened, and more than ten new openings have been made. As of December 1 last year, the entire third district had developed to forty-six kilns, with 456 people, producing 500,230 catties of coal daily. The output is about to reach the pre-war level, the number of kilns is almost twice that before the war, and the number of coal workers is increasing day by day. Large and small livestock vehicles from Yi, Jiang and other counties are constantly carrying and pulling coal on the road. The kiln owners are improving tools, establishing kiln regulations, looking for workers, and sending out sales personnel to do their best to expand operations.

　　沁水三区煤窑逐渐恢复
  　产量将达抗战前水准
    【太岳电】沁水三区煤窑，抗战前共有二十六座，有五百三十五个工人，每日可产煤六十万斤。后经日伪摧残，大半停顿。近年来在我民主政府扶植下，又渐渐恢复起来。但因有些窑主还不了解我们发展工业的政策，或因出了煤卖不出去，便不再大量开采。如前年冬天虽有二十八座煤窑，但工人只有三百四十二人，每日只产煤三十八万六千斤，和战前相差很远。去冬布置冬季生产工作后，工商局同志即深入煤矿区，召开煤窑经理会议，耐心解释政策，并帮助解决销路等困难，一月来煤业得到迅速发展。下峪的石炭窑，起初只有工人十个，这次会议后，窑主韩玉贵、王文玉等即负责经营，现已发展到三十二个工人，每日可产煤四万三千二百斤。公炭窑经理王玉柱过去对政府号召的“产运销结合”想不通，他说：“盘古至今，绛县车就没到过沁水拉煤。”怕开采出来卖不了。但自十月间沁、绛大道修通后，好多绛县大车来沁水担煤，他才急忙到各处找寻了二十多个工人，扩大开采。上峪的新炭窑、桩沟窑、杏峪的西沟窑、尧都的关帝窑、冶内的太上窑，都是停了数年甚至数十年的老窑，现已重新开采，并又新开了十多个口。到去年十二月一日，全三区已发展到四十六座窑，有四百五十六人，每日可产煤五十万零二千三百三十斤。产量已快达到抗战前的水平了，窑数则快超过战前一倍，煤业工人也一天比一天加多。翼、绛等县大小牲口车辆，驮的驮，拉的拉，路上不断。窑主则正在改良工具，建立窑规，找寻工人，派出推销人员，尽力扩大经营。
