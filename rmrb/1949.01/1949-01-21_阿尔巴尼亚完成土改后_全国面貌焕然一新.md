Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS dispatch: January 11th marked the third anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of Albania. The Soviet Young Communist League's "Pravda" wrote in commemoration of this holiday: Albania's progressive democratic reforms have been completed in a very short period. This would be impossible under bourgeois democratic systems. Land reform has eliminated feudal agriculture in the country. Now, working farmers own more than 95 percent of the country's arable land. Land reform also created favorable conditions for agricultural mechanization. There are now twenty-five machine-tractor stations in the country. The sown area and harvest have greatly exceeded pre-war levels. Since 1947, Albania has achieved full self-sufficiency in grain for the first time in its history. The productivity of Albania's oil fields, copper and chromium mines, and coal mines has greatly exceeded pre-war levels. Electricity production has increased to three times the pre-war level. The state has begun to systematically manage all industries in the national economy. Along with Albania's economic development and consolidation, Albania's new culture is also flourishing. In the past three years, the number of schools has doubled, and universities, agricultural and normal colleges, music schools, and art schools have all opened. More than 100,000 people are learning to read and write in literacy classes (the population of Albania is more than one million). The Young Communist League's "Pravda" especially praised the Albanian youth who play an important role in the construction of the People's Republic.

　　阿尔巴尼亚完成土改后
  　全国面貌焕然一新
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：一月十一日是阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国建立三周年纪念。苏联少共真理报在纪念这一节日时写道：阿尔巴尼亚的进步的民主改革，已于很短期间完成。这在资产阶级民主制度的条件下是不可能的。土地改革已消除了该国的封建农业。现在，全国劳动农民占有百分之九十五以上的耕地。土地改革同时为农业机械化创造了有利的条件。现在，全国有二十五个机器——拖拉机站。播种面积和收获量已大大超过战前水平。从一九四七年起，阿尔巴尼亚有史以来在谷物方面达到了充分自给。阿尔巴尼亚的油田、铜与铬矿、煤井的生产率大大超过战前水平。电力生产已增加到战前的三倍。国家已开始有计划地管理全国经济中的一切工业。与阿尔巴尼亚经济发展和巩固的同时，阿尔巴尼亚的新文化也蓬勃成长着。在最近三年中，学校增加了二倍，大学、农业和师范学院、音乐学校和美术学校都已开学。十万多人民在识字班学习读和写（阿国人口为一百余万人）。少共真理报对在建设人民共和国工作中起重要作用的阿尔巴尼亚青年，特别加以赞扬。
