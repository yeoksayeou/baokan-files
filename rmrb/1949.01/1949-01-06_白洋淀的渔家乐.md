There are over fifty fishing villages in Baiyangdian. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the daily fish output was around 40,000 catties, with 38% going to Tianjin and Beijing, and 62% sold inland. At that time, fish shops and fish merchants exploited the fishermen in various ways, so the fishermen worked hard all year round but couldn't get enough to eat or wear. After the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy's rule became even more severe, restricting the fishermen's freedom to trade, which made the fishermen's lives even more difficult. Some sold off all their tools, leading to a sharp decline in the number of fishing households.

After liberation, the fishermen broke the rule of the fish patrols, and fishermen could trade freely. Some villages also organized cooperatives, smashing the intermediate exploitation of the fish shops. Therefore, a new atmosphere has emerged in the fishing industry.

Baiyangdian suffered severe flooding this autumn, and the lives of most of the disaster victims mainly depend on fishing. According to a survey in Datianzhuang, reed mat weaving can solve 36% of the villagers' livelihood, fishing solves 35%, transportation solves 10%, and agriculture solves 25% in a good year. However, this year the crops were flooded, so this 25% also needs to be subsidized by fishing. At present, there are 64 fishing villages, with methods such as seine netting, cormorant fishing, fixed teams, winter fishing, and beehive fishing. Each person can earn 300 to 700 (new currency) a day, which is enough to maintain their livelihood. In total, Baiyangdian can produce about 30,000 catties of fish a day. Most of the fish produced are sold in inland counties, with exports accounting for only 10% to 20%. Currently, there are six large fish shops that take the fish, so sales are not a problem. According to experienced fishermen, the fish output is not as high now as it will be after the ice freezes, because this year's autumn fishing season generally suffers from high water levels, and most are waiting for the winter fishing season.

Now the fishermen are very enthusiastic about fishing, and are preparing and repairing fishing tools, forming groups and teams for fishing. Zhaobeikou, Santianzhuang, Tongkou, and Guolikou have organized 45 teams (each team ranging from 40-50 to over 200 people), and almost every village with fishing grounds is preparing for winter fishing.

In order to solve the difficulties of the fishermen in fishing, the Anxin County Production Promotion Agency has purchased 557 bamboo poles and 60 sheets of cowhide. Longchang Store and Yongmao Company have also transferred 3,700 catties of blood meal and 3,000 catties of white hemp to help those who are really in difficulty. Currently, Dadientou, Xiaotianzhuang, and Macun three large net teams, Beitianzhuang, Zhaobeikou, Guancheng, Datianzhuang, Liangzhuang, Yangmengzhuang six villages and nine winter fishing teams have been supported, and four villages and nine winter fishing teams and Datianzhuang's two fixed teams have been promoted. In total, 68 fishing groups have been organized in eleven villages, with a total of 580 households, and more than 90,000 yuan (new currency) of fishing loans have been issued, driving private investment.

Because the fishermen are actively organizing to fish, sales are not a problem, and the autumn fishing season output is low, the fish production will increase significantly after the winter netting and winter fishing seasons begin, it is estimated that the daily fish production will reach 60,000 catties, and the lives of 48,960 people can be resolved. Therefore, the fishermen are actively and happily fishing, and everyone has the confidence to overcome the disaster.

### 白洋淀的渔家乐

　　白洋淀的渔家乐
    白洋淀共有五十多个治鱼村庄。抗战以前，每天产鱼四万斤上下，百分之三十八往平津走，百分之六十二销在内地。当时鱼店和鱼行，用各种方法来剥削渔民，因此渔民辛苦一年吃不饱穿不暖。抗战以后，敌人的统治更厉害，限制渔民自由买卖，使的渔民生活更苦，有的把工具当卖一空，因此渔户大量减少。
    解放以后，渔民打破了鱼巡的统治，渔民可以自由买卖了；有的村还组织了合作社，打垮了鱼店的中间剥削。所以，治鱼业又出现了新的气象。
    白洋淀今秋水灾厉害，多数灾民的生活以治鱼为主要依靠。据大田庄的调查，席业收入可以解决全村群众百分之三十六的生活，治鱼解决百分之卅五，运输解决百分之十，丰收年农业解决百分之二十五。可是今年庄稼被淹，所以这百分之二十五，也要靠治鱼来补助。眼下治鱼的村庄共有六十四个，有拉坝网、放鱼鹰、按班子、出汕、下密蜂等，一个人一天所得三四百到七八百（新币下同），能够维持生活。总计白洋淀一天可以产鱼三万斤上下。所出的鱼，大部销在内地各县，出口仅占百分之十到二十。现在共有六个大鱼店接鱼，销路不成问题。据有经验的渔民谈，现在出鱼不如冻冰以后出的多，因为今年的秋汕一般的嫌水大，大都等待出冬汕。
    现在渔民治鱼的心气很盛，都正在操办和修补治鱼的工具，插伙结组治鱼。赵北口、三田庄、同口、郭里口，就组织起了四十五班（一班四五十人到二百多人），差不多每个有汕地的村，都准备出冬汕。
    为了解决渔民治鱼当中的困难，安新县生产推进社，已买来竹竿五百五十七根，牛皮六十张；隆昌商店和永茂公司，还调运了三千七百斤血料和三千斤白麻，对实在困难的户给以帮助。现在已经扶植起来的有大淀头、小田庄、马村三个大网班，北田庄、赵北口、关城、大田庄、梁庄、杨孟庄六个村九个出汕班，并带动起了四个村九个出汕班，和大田庄的两个按班。总计，共在十一个村组织了六十八个治渔组，共五百八十户，发放了渔业贷款九万多元（新币）带动了私资。
    由于渔民积极组织起来治鱼，销路又不成问题，和秋汕出的少，所以冬网班和冬汕班开始以后，鱼的产量就会大量增加，估计每天产鱼将达六万斤，四万八千九百六十人的生活可得到解决，所以渔民都积极愉快的治鱼，大家有信心战胜灾荒。
