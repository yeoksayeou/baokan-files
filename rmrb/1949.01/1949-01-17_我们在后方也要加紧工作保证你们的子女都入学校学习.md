To all commanders and fighters at the front:
    The New Year has arrived. This New Year, in which the revolution is about to achieve complete victory, is worthy of our encouragement and celebration. These victories are the crystallization of your heroic fighting at the front, unafraid of sacrifice.
    You are the vanguards of the revolution, the heroes of the people, fighting across thousands of miles, racing inside and outside the passes, unafraid of bloodshed and sweat, striving to make the enemy surrender. The great news of victory on the battlefield is seen every day, and these are all your achievements. Now, on the occasion of the New Year, all our teachers and students extend our sincere greetings to you, and wish you to continue your efforts to fight for the liberation of all of North China and all of China!
    We in the rear should also step up our work to ensure that all your children can attend school, preparing them to be the masters of the future! We will also publicize to the masses, step up production, and support the front, using practical actions as New Year gifts for you.
    　　　　　　With
    Revolutionary Victory!
    　　　　　　　　　　　The entire faculty and students of Zhao Village Primary School, Seventh District, Zhengding County, bow in respect.
