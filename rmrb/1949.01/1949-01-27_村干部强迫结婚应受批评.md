To the Editors:

　　In Shentangtou Village, Second District, Qi County, there is a woman named Cheng Peiyun, 18 years old. Her family has a rich peasant background. After being struggled against last year, this February, village cadres forced her to marry a certain man in the village. At the time, she herself was unwilling, but the village cadres threatened her, saying, "If you don't marry so-and-so, we will beat you to death, or we will send you to the judicial section." At that time, Cheng Peiyun's family could not maintain their livelihood. When she wanted to marry someone else, the village cadres did not allow it, and said, "You still want to find a good man?" At the same time, they used various means of coercion and intimidation to make her marry a certain man in the village, and said, "When you go to the district office to get married, when the district head asks you, just say you are willing." At that time, Cheng Peiyun reluctantly agreed in order to save her life. Since getting married this spring, she has been at odds with her husband, often quarreling, and crying every day. Now Cheng Peiyun is proposing a divorce, and the cadres are even more frightened, saying, "You are feudal and still want a divorce? You will die in his house; if you mention divorce again, we will gather the masses to struggle against you," and even hit her with a stick, scaring her so much that she dare not say anything anymore, but she doesn't know what to do in the future? Please give her some guidance.

(Answer) It is wrong for cadres to force marriage. This is a very serious manifestation of feudal thinking. If it is true, then the cadres should be criticized or even punished. According to your letter, that woman was threatened a lot and forced to marry in the village. Now the couple often quarrel, which shows that the two sides are emotionally incompatible. If mediation fails, they can get divorced. (Judicial Department of the North China People's Government)

　　村干部强迫结婚应受批评编者同志：
    祁县二区神堂头村有一妇女程培云，现年十八岁，家庭是富农成份，去年被斗后，今年二月间村干部强迫她同本村某人结婚。当时她本人就不愿意，但村干部威吓她说：“你要不跟某人结婚就要摔死你，不然就要送你到司法科去。”这时程培云家中无法维持生活，她要同他人结婚，村干部却不许可，并说：“你还要找个好男人？”同时以各种强迫和威吓的手段叫她和本村某人结婚，并说：“到区所结婚，区长等问你，就说你是自愿的。”程培云那时为了保全生命，就勉强答应了。自今春结婚以后，她就和男人不和，经常吵架，每日哭哭啼啼。现在程培云提出要离婚，干部更恐吓说：“你是封建还要离婚，死也得死到他家；你要再提离婚，就要集合群众斗你”，甚至拿棍子打她，吓的她再不敢说了，但不知今后应该怎么办呢？请你们给她一个指示。

    （答）干部强迫结婚是错误的，这是很严重的封建思想在作怪；如果是真的，那干部应该受到批评甚至处分。据你来信说，那个女子是受了很多威吓，被迫在本村结婚了，现在经常夫妇吵架，这说明了双方感情不合，如果调解不好，就可以离婚。（华北人民政府司法部）
