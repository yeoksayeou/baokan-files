　　Soviet Five-Year Plan – After the end of the Patriotic War, the Soviet Union formulated a new five-year plan from 1946 to 1950 (before the war, the Soviet Union had implemented three five-year plans, so this new five-year plan is also called the Fourth Five-Year Plan). The basic task of this five-year plan was to restore the cruel destruction inflicted on the Soviet Union by the barbarous German army during the war, and to bring industry and agriculture to pre-war levels; then to continue to strive to exceed pre-war levels. After the plan was promulgated, it immediately received enthusiastic support from the people of the entire Soviet Union. The vast number of workers and farmers displayed unparalleled enthusiasm for production and construction. The production plans for each period were completed ahead of schedule or on schedule. Currently, the people of the entire Soviet Union are striving to complete the five-year plan in four years, and some departments have already completed the entire plan.
　　Potsdam Decisions – Refers to the decisions on German issues made at the Potsdam Conference. This conference was held from July 17 to August 2, 1945, in Potsdam, 18 kilometers southwest of Berlin, the capital of Germany, by Stalin, Truman, and Attlee. This Potsdam Conference decided on many principles regarding the disposal of Germany, such as completely disarming Germany, completely eliminating all potential war forces, controlling German industry, trying German war criminals, and rebuilding a democratic and unified new Germany. However, for more than three years, American and British imperialism have repeatedly violated the decisions, attempting to use Germany as a base for anti-Soviet and anti-democratic activities in Europe. In the western American, British, and French occupation zones, Nazi elements have not been purged, and democratic forces have been suppressed instead. Recently, American and British imperialism have also handed over many industries to German Nazi elements, creating division among the German people, but this has been met with strong opposition from the German people.
　　Tito Clique – Refers to the leading group of the Yugoslav Communist Party represented by Tito, Kardelj, Djilas, and Ranković. The policies implemented by this leading group, both internally and externally, completely betray Marxism-Leninism, adopting an unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union and falling into the quagmire of nationalism. Internally, it denies that the basic leading force in Yugoslavia is not the Yugoslav Communist Party but the non-communist "People's Front," abolishing party leadership, lacking democracy, elections, and criticism and self-criticism within the party, and implementing militaristic leadership methods. Yugoslav Communist Party members have lost basic rights within the party, and even slight criticism of the party's mistakes is met with brutal suppression by the Tito clique. Although the Information Bureau conference exposed and criticized the Tito clique's erroneous actions that harm the interests of the Yugoslav people, the Tito clique stubbornly clung to its errors. As a result, the Tito clique has become isolated from the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe; and Yugoslav party members with a correct Marxist-Leninist understanding are increasingly disgusted with this degenerated assassination group.

    苏联五年计划——苏联在爱国战争结束后，就制订了一个由一九四六年到一九五○年的新五年计划（战前苏联曾经实行过三届五年计划，所以这一次的新五年计划，也叫第四届五年计划）。这个五年计划的基本任务，就是恢复战争中野蛮的德国军队给与苏联的残酷破坏，使工、农业达到战前的水平；然后继续努力超过战前水平。这个计划颁布后：立即获得全苏人民的热烈支持，广大工人、农民发挥无比的生产建设热情，各个时期的生产计划，无不提前或按期完成，目前全苏人民正争取五年计划四年完成，有些部门且已完成全部计划。
    波茨坦决定——是指波茨坦会议有关德国问题的决定。这个会议是一九四五年七月十七日至八月二日，由斯大林、杜鲁门、艾德礼在德国首都柏林西南十八公里的波茨坦地方举行的。这次波茨坦会议上决定了关于处置德国的许多原则，如彻底解除德国武装、彻底消灭一切潜在的战争力量；管制德国工业，审判德国战犯，重建民主统一的新德国等。但是三年多来，美英帝国主义一再违背决定，妄图以德国作为在欧洲反苏反民主的基地，在西部美英法占领区，纳粹分子未肃清，民主力量反而受到镇压，最近美英帝国主义并将许多工业交给德国纳粹分子，制造德国人民间的分裂，但遭到德国人民坚强的反对。
    铁托集团——是指以铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇为代表的南斯拉夫共产党领导集团，这个领导集团对内对外所执行的政策完全背叛了马克思主义——列宁主义，对苏联进行非友好的政策而堕入民族主义的泥坑。对内，否定南斯拉夫国内基本领导力量不是南斯拉夫共产党而是非共产党的“人民阵线”，取消党的领导，在党内没有民主、没有选举、没有批评与自我批评，而实行着军国主义的领导方法，南共党员在党内失去了基本的权利，对党内的错误稍加批评，就遭到铁托集团的残酷镇压。铁托集团这种危害南斯拉夫人民利益的错误行动，虽经情报局会议揭发批评，但铁托集团固执自己的错误。由于这样，铁托集团已自东欧各新民主主义国家中孤立起来；而南斯拉夫党内具有的马列主义正确认识的党员，日益厌恶这个蜕化了的谋杀集团。
