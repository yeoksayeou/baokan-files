　　Shijiazhuang City Promotion Cooperative Strives to Stabilize Prices
　　[Our Newspaper] On the 28th of last month, the Shijiazhuang City Production Promotion Cooperative convened a meeting of responsible comrades for supply and sales business from the city's district cooperatives, as well as directors of street supply and marketing cooperatives, to discuss the issue of supplying members with food at low prices and vigorously developing retail business to ensure the supply of daily food for citizens. The meeting decided: resolutely oppose the old profit mentality, closely combine with state-owned stores to stabilize prices, and earnestly serve members and the masses: (1) The price of food supplied to members should be cheaper than the price sold to citizens by 3 to 3.5 jiao, and the quality of millet should be guaranteed to be higher than retail. In their operations, each cooperative should strictly separate the supply of grain to members from the grain for residents, abide by discipline, and ensure credit; (2) Under the premise of overcoming the profit mentality, the retail price will be uniformly stipulated by the city cooperative, and each cooperative will sell at the unified price, without any price increases. The supply of rice for citizens is guaranteed to be sufficient.
　　[Another News] The city cooperative's supply and marketing department is planning to purchase a large batch of New Year's goods to adapt to the masses' customs of celebrating the old lunar year, in order to supply members and citizens at low prices during the New Year period and spend a happy New Year.
