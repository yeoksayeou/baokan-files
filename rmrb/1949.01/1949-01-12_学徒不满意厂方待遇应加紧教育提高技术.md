　　Apprentices Dissatisfied with Factory Treatment Should Intensify Education and Improve Skills
　　To the Editor:
　　I agree with the measures concerning industrial and commercial policies decided upon at the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, but some practical difficulties cannot be resolved. For example, since the implementation of the new wage system here, problems have arisen regarding the treatment of trainees. Their monthly wage is 22 yuan, which, after deducting 20 yuan for food, leaves them with difficulties in clothing and other needs. As a result, their morale is very low, and some even want to quit. Despite explanations from the leadership, they still say, "Workers have no future, it's better to go home and farm." Especially now that the weather is very cold, some of them are far from home, and some have no home at all, and the cotton clothing problem cannot be solved. Although the leadership has promised to lend them some, they are afraid they will not be able to repay it later, and they dare not ask for it. (Zhao Tiezhu)
　　Answer: The Sixth National Labor Congress's resolution regarding the treatment of apprentices stipulates that they should only be provided with food, not clothing. This issue should be approached from the perspective of developing production, not from a relief-oriented viewpoint. Apprentices are in the factory to learn skills, not to produce, so they cannot expect the factory to solve all their food and clothing problems as soon as they enter the factory. From the apprentice's perspective, the main goal of entering the factory is to learn skills, not to earn wages. Furthermore, if the treatment is too high, some business owners will be unwilling to recruit and train large numbers of apprentices, which is not beneficial to the apprentices themselves. Some apprentices have ideological problems, even saying things like workers have no future. The trade union and the state-owned enterprise management should step up political education to raise their awareness, so that they truly recognize the long-term interests of the proletariat, and help them improve their skills. Make them understand that if they progress quickly, the length of their apprenticeship can be shortened. As for individual cases with special difficulties, the factory and the trade union should try their best to help them find solutions. (Editor)

　　学徒不满意厂方待遇应加紧教育提高技术编辑同志：
    在华北工商业会议决定之有关工商业政策方面的办法我都很同意，但是有些实际的困难却无法解决。比如我们这里自实行新工资制后，在练习生的待遇上就发生问题。他们每月的工资是廿二个＠，除去伙食费二十个＠外，在穿用上就有了困难。因此，他们的情绪很低落，甚至有想不干的；虽经领导上的解释，他们还是说：“工人没有前途，还是回家种地去好。”尤其是现在天气很冷，他们有的离家很远，有的没有家，棉衣问题没法解决，虽然领导上答应借给他们，但他们怕借以后无法偿还，都不敢要。（赵铁柱）
    答：第六次全国劳动大会的决议中，关于学徒待遇的规定是：只供其本人伙食，不供穿着。对待这个问题应从发展生产着眼，而不能从救济观点出发。学徒在厂是学习技术而不是生产，因之不能一进厂衣食问题就都由厂方解决。就学徒方面说，进厂主要为学习技术，而不在挣工资；同时如待遇太高，反使一些企业主不愿大量招收培养，对自己也没有好处。有些学徒思想不通，甚至说什么工人没有前途等等，工会和公营企业厂方应抓紧进行政治教育，提高觉悟，使他们真正认识到无产阶级的远大利益，帮助他们提高技术。使他们懂得如果进步得快，学习年限就可缩短，至于个别有特殊困难者，厂方和工会应尽量给他们设法帮助解决。（编者）
