　　Implementing Leadership by Industry
  　Changzhi City Abolishes District-Level Institutions
    [Taihang News] The Changzhi Municipal Government convened a meeting of street chiefs from all 34 streets in the city on December 8th, announcing the abolition of district-level leadership institutions. The reason given was that cities and rural areas have different characteristics, and cities should be led by different industries and trades, and are not suitable for the rural division method based on regions. Regarding how the institutions will change and the specific issues after the change, there are the following points: First, the work of the streets will be planned, promoted, and controlled by the street chiefs based on the instructions of the Municipal Government; Second, the street chiefs will not be required to submit regular work reports to the Municipal Government for the time being, but the Municipal Government will conduct spot checks on the work of each street, and the street committee directors will report directly to the relevant departments of the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government will absorb the participation of street chiefs when deploying important tasks, while general tasks will be deployed, inspected, reported, and summarized by the relevant department heads. Third, problems occurring in each street will be resolved by the relevant departments of the Municipal Government; if they cannot be clearly identified, they can be resolved by the secretariat. Fourth, each street will establish a duty system, with all cadres taking turns to be on duty for one day each, handling all administrative work for the day; Fifth, the official documents and instructions issued by the Municipal Government to each street, in addition to being studied, led, and implemented by the street chiefs, should also be reported, compiled, and filed to establish archives for handover.

　　实行按行业领导
  　长治市取消区级机构
    【太行讯】长治市府于十二月八号召开了全市三十四个街的街长会议，宣布取消区级领导机构。理由是：城市和农村有不同的特点，城市应按各行、各业分门别类的领导，而不适宜于按地区的农村划法。关于机构怎样变和变后的具体问题，有以下几点：一、街的工作，由街长根据市府的指示，负责计划推动掌握；二、暂不定街长向市府作定期的工作汇报，但市府要抽查各街工作，街主任委员要向市府有关科作直接汇报，市府布置重要工作时吸收各街长参加，一般工作则由各科召开有关的各主任委员布置、检查、汇报、总结。三、各街发生问题，由市府有关部门解决；分不清的可找秘书处解决。四、各街建立值日制，所有干部分别每人轮流值日一天，办理一日中所有行政工作；五、市府所发各街公文指示，除街长研究领导执行外，并应汇报集订卷，建立档案，以便移交。
