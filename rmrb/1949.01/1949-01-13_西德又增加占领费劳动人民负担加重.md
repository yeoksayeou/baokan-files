Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 9th: TASS reports from Berlin by a *Pravda* reporter: Just as occupation costs in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany are being continuously reduced, U.S. military governor for Germany, Clay, announced at the end of last month that occupation costs would be further increased in West Germany, thereby increasing the burden on the working people of West Germany. The occupation costs of the Western countries, due to continuous increases, have long reached 5.5 billion marks. According to French General Heber, in order to supply one American in the joint occupation zone of West Germany, it costs the Germans 20,000 marks per year, which is almost equal to ten years' income for an average German worker. In individual states in West Germany, more than 50 percent of all tax revenue is used for occupation costs. In the Western-occupied zone of Berlin, 32.2 million of the 37 million marks in tax revenue in October of last year were used for occupation costs. All kinds of incredible plans receive funding through occupation fees. For example, 320,000 marks were spent on building a swimming pool for an American general. It is claimed that one-seventh of all working people in the western occupation zone of Berlin are working for representatives of the Western occupying powers. The number of employees working for the Western military government and the occupying forces reaches one million. A huge army of millions is paid for by occupation costs. In order to maintain the infamous "airlift," new burdens have been brought to the people of West Germany, and a surcharge has been implemented in the West German joint occupation zone. According to the commander of the U.S. Air Force in Europe, the "airlift" cost $24 million in the first two months alone. The former chairman of the Berlin City Council, Suhr, recently admitted that Western countries allocate 53 million marks per month to maintain this "airlift." This loan is also written on the Germans' account.

　　西德又增加占领费劳动人民负担加重
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社讯：真理报记者自柏林报导：正当德境苏占区占领费用不断削减之际，德境美国军政府总督克莱于上月底宣布，又将在西德增加占领费用，从而使西德劳动人民的负担益形加重。西方国家的占领费用，由于不断增加，早已达到了五十五亿马克。据法国的海伯将军说：为了供给西德联合占领区的一个美国人，需要德国人每年花费两万马克，这几乎等于一个平常的德国工人十年的收入。在西德个别的州中，全部税收中有百分之五十以上充作占领费用。而在柏林西占区，去年十月份之三千七百万马克的税收中，则有三千二百万用于占领费。各种极难置信的计划，通过占领费的形式得到经费。例如，三十二万马克花在为某美国将军建造游泳池上。据称，柏林西部占领区全部劳动人民中，有七分之一是在为西方占领国的代表们做事。为西方军政府及占领军工作的职工，数达一百万人。数百万人的庞大队伍由占领费开支。为了维持臭名远扬的“空运”，又给西德人民带来了新的负担，西德联占区已经实行征收附加税。据美驻欧空军总司令称：仅在空运开始的两个月，就花费了二千四百万美元。前柏林市议会主席苏尔新近承认，西方国家每月拨贷款五千三百万马克以维持这一“空运”之用。这笔贷款也是写在德国人的帐上的。
