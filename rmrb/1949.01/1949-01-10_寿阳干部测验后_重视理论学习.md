　　Shouyang Cadres Emphasize Theoretical Study After Examination
　　[This newspaper reported] After Shouyang county and district-level cadres took an examination, they began to value theoretical study. The county held a learning examination on December 17th. 101 cadres participated, including 3 county committee members, one of whom failed. Out of 48 county section chiefs, district committee members, and district heads, 20 failed. Out of 50 cadres below the district committee level, 32 failed. Some comrades were still very unclear about the Party's general line and general policies. Some even answered that the main classes constituting the coalition government were "landlords and big bourgeoisie." Only the county-level organizations had relatively good results. After the examination, most comrades felt, "It won't do if we don't study anymore." "We are determined to study hard in the future." In order to strictly enforce the learning system, the county committee made a self-criticism at the meeting for relaxing leadership, and resolved several ideological problems existing among the cadres: (1) The issue of time: Comrades from the bank raised "We are busy with work, we don't have time." The county committee pointed out: As long as we value it ideologically and keep the learning problem in our minds, we will find time. Strengthening Marxist-Leninist theory will make better use of time, turn busy work into organized work, and we will have more time to study. (2) Point out that arrogance and complacency are the greatest enemies, emphasize that learning should be modest, put down airs, ask people more questions, and do more research. (3) Point out that learning must be active and conscious. After the arrangements, each district has begun to make learning plans and study earnestly.

　　寿阳干部测验后
  　重视理论学习
    【本报讯】寿阳县、区级干部经过测验，开始重视理论学习。该县十二月十七日曾举行学习测验，参加干部一百零一人，其中县委三人有一人不及格，县科长、区委、区长级干部四十八名中，二十人不及格，五十名区委级以下干部中，卅二人不及格。一部分同志对党的总路线总政策还非常模糊不清，更甚至有人把构成联合政府的主要阶层答成“大地主、大资产阶级。”只有县级机关中成绩较好。经过测验，大部同志都感到：“再不学习可不行了。”“决心在今后好好学习。”该县县委为严格学习制度，曾在会上做了放松领导的检讨，并解决了存在干部思想上的几个问题：（一）时间问题：银行的同志曾提出“业务忙，没时间”，县委指出：只要思想上重视，把学习问题刻在脑子里，就会抽出时间来；加强了马列主义理论，就会更好地运用时间，使繁忙的工作变为有条有理的工作，也就更会有时间学习了。（二）指出自高自大、满足现状的思想是最大敌人，强调学习要虚心，放下架子，多问人，多研究。（三）指出学习必须主动、自觉地进行。布置后，各区已开始作了学习计划，认真学习起来。
