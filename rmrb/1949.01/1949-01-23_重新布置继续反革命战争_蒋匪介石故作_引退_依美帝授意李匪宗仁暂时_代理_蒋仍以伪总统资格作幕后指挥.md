Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: The Kuomintang government's pseudo-president Chiang Kai-shek announced his "retirement" on the 22nd under the pretext of "being unable to attend to duties due to illness," and "in accordance with the constitution" handed over his duties to pseudo-vice president Li Zongren to "act" on his behalf. Li Zongren is a tool long designated by the US government to replace Chiang Kai-shek when necessary. That is precisely why the Americans supported him to become the pseudo-vice president. Since last December, the US government has repeatedly urged Chiang Kai-shek in various ways to retreat behind the scenes. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on December 18th last year: Truman directly wrote to Chiang Kai-shek in December last year, asking him "whether he had considered the question of his resignation or continued rule." But in fact, Chiang Kai-shek did not announce his resignation. What Chiang Kai-shek announced was "unable to attend to duties due to illness," and he temporarily left Nanjing. He is still the "president" of the Kuomintang government. In Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement" statement, he said "Acting President Li," which was immediately corrected by the Central News Agency to "Vice President Li," to avoid any misunderstanding about the continued existence of Chiang Kai-shek's "presidential" status. Before "leaving office," Chiang Kai-shek made new arrangements for continuing the counter-revolutionary war, appointing Chen Cheng as the chairman of Taiwan Province and the commander of the Taiwan Garrison, Chiang Ching-kuo as the chairman of the Taiwan Kuomintang Provincial Party Headquarters, Zhu Shaoliang as the director of the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters and concurrently the chairman of Fujian, Fang Tian as the chairman of Jiangxi Province, Yu Hanmou as the director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, Xue Yue as the chairman of Guangdong Province, and Zhang Qun as the director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters. While the Kuomintang government's Executive Yuan made the absurd decision on the 19th to "immediately implement an unconditional ceasefire," it notified the embassies of various countries stationed in Nanjing to move to Guangzhou. All real power of the Kuomintang government remains in the hands of the Chiang faction and Chiang Kai-shek himself. All indications show that the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government has no sincerity in accepting genuine democratic peace.

　　重新布置继续反革命战争
  　蒋匪介石故作“引退”
    依美帝授意李匪宗仁暂时“代理”蒋仍以伪总统资格作幕后指挥
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】国民党政府伪总统蒋介石在廿二日以“因故不能视事”的名义宣告“引退”，而把职务“依据宪法”交给伪副总统李宗仁“代理”。李宗仁是美国政府久已内定的必要时机代替蒋介石的工具，正是因为这样，美国人才支持他当了伪副总统。美国政府在去年十二月以来曾用各种方式再三催促蒋介石退到幕后去。据去年十二月十八日合众社上海电称：杜鲁门曾于去年十二月直接致函蒋介石，问他“是否已考虑他辞职或继续执政的问题”。但是事实上蒋介石并没有宣布辞职。蒋介石宣布的是“因故不能视事”，暂时离开南京，他仍然是国民党政府的“总统”。蒋介石所发的“引退”文告中说了一句“李代总统”，随即由中央社更正为“李副总统”，以免人们关于蒋介石的“总统”地位继续存在一点发生任何误会。蒋介石在“离职”以前对于继续反革命战争作了新的安排，以陈诚为台湾省主席和台湾警备司令，蒋经国为台湾国民党省党部主任委员，朱绍良为福州绥靖公署主任兼福建的主席，方天为江西省主席，余汉谋为广州绥靖公署主任，薛岳为广东省主席，张群为重庆绥靖公署主任。国民党政府行政院于十九日作出“立即先行无条件停战”的荒谬决议的同时，通知驻南京各国使节迁往广州。国民党政府的一切实际权力仍然操在蒋系和蒋介石本人手里。一切迹象，都表明南京国民党反动政府没有任何愿意接受真正的民主的和平的诚意。
