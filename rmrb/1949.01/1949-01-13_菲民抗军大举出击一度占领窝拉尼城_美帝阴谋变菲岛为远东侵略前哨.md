Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Manila dispatch: Just as Philippine Interior Minister Balunat was proclaiming that the People's Anti-Japanese Army in Central Luzon had been wiped out, the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army was launching a large-scale offensive against the American puppet government's troops in four provinces of Central Luzon. This action began in late December. On the 5th of this month, the People's Anti-Japanese Army attacked Lumbang City in Laguna Province, attacked Haan City in Rivaisiha Province, attacked Nochaglao City in Bulacan Province, and briefly occupied Wawani City in Bataan Province. The Philippine puppet government is conducting a large-scale search and arrest of Filipino people "related to the new attacks of the People's Anti-Japanese Army."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: American imperialism, frightened by the victorious offensive of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is attempting to turn the Philippines, which it controls and has a population of over 19.2 million, into one of the important American aggression bases in the Far East. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch dated December 31st: American officials stationed in Manila stated: "Manila will become the most important diplomatic outpost in the Far East." The United States "will send a top-level diplomatic official to Manila to replace US Ambassador to the Philippines O'Neill, who recently resigned."

The Philippine Quirino government, as a Wall Street watchdog, is playing its "anti-Communist threat" trick to please its master, attempting to use this to carry out large-scale anti-Chinese activities and suppress the democratic movement, in order to clear the way for the American policy of turning the Philippines into an important aggression base in the Far East. Quirino has repeatedly mentioned this "threat" in his speeches over the past two months. On December 30th, the Philippine authorities suddenly conducted a large-scale search and arrest of so-called "Communist" elements on the pretext of "discovering" a large amount of military supplies in a Chinese merchant's lumberyard. However, what is noteworthy in connection with this despicable behavior of the Quirino government is that the so-called pre-war "Association for the Protection of National Economy" in the Philippines suddenly announced its restoration on the very day of the search and arrest of the so-called Communist elements. This move has aroused serious attention from the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, because it means that the Philippine government will "take drastic policies" (Agence France-Presse) against the enterprises of overseas Chinese. At the same time, the Philippine government has decided to continue to step up its operations against the People's Anti-Japanese Army, which is demanding national independence and freedom. To this end, the Philippine government's military budget for this year has increased by 20 percent compared to last year, accounting for one-quarter of this year's total budget of 240 million pesos.

### 菲民抗军大举出击一度占领窝拉尼城　美帝阴谋变菲岛为远东侵略前哨

　　菲民抗军大举出击一度占领窝拉尼城
  　美帝阴谋变菲岛为远东侵略前哨
    【新华社陕北十日电】马尼拉讯：当菲内长巴鲁纳特扬言中吕宋民抗军已被肃清的时候，菲律宾民抗军正在中吕宋的四个省份里大举进攻美国傀儡政府的军队。这个行动开始于十二月下旬。本月五日，民抗军曾袭击拉古纳省的鲁姆邦城，进攻蕊瓦伊西哈省的哈恩城、布拉干省的诺查格拉奥城，并一度占领巴坦省的窝拉尼城。菲律宾傀儡政府，正在大肆搜捕“与民抗军的新袭击有关”的菲律宾人民。
    【新华社陕北八日电】被中国人民解放军的胜利攻势所吓慌了的美国帝国主义，正企图将其所控制的具有一千九百二十余万人口的菲律宾，变为美国在远东的重要侵略基地之一。据法新社十二月三十一日电：美国驻马尼拉负责官员表示：“马尼拉将成为远东的最重要外交前哨。”美国“将派一最高级外交官员赴马尼拉，以代替最近辞职的美驻菲大使奥尼尔”。
    作为华尔街警犬的菲律宾季里诺政府，为了取悦其主子，正在大耍其反对“中共威胁”的把戏，企图借此大肆排华和镇压民主运动，以便为美国变菲律宾为其远东重要侵略基地之政策扫清道路。季里诺于近两月来所发表的谈话中，曾屡次提到这种“威胁”。十二月三十日，菲当局于借口在某中国商人的一所木材场中“发现”大量军火后，突然大肆搜捕所谓“中共”分子。但与季里诺政府的这种卑鄙行为有关而值得注意的是，恰恰就在搜捕所谓中共分子的那一天，菲律宾战前的所谓“保护民族经济协会”突宣告恢复。此举已引起菲岛华侨的严重注意，因为它意味着菲律宾政府将对华侨的企业“采取激烈的政策”（法新社）。同时，菲政府已决定继续加紧对要求国家独立、自由的民抗军的作战。为此，菲政府今年的军事预算已比去年增加百分之二十，占今年总预算二亿四千万比索的四分之一。
