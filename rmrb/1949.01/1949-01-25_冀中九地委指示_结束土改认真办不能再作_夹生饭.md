Ji'zhong Ninth Prefectural Committee Instruction
　　End the Land Reform Carefully, Cannot Make "Half-Cooked Rice" Again
　　[Our Newspaper News] According to the Hebei Daily, the Ninth Prefectural Committee reported: The ending of land reform work in the Seventh District of Suning was completed very quickly. According to the District Committee: it was all completed before the 7th. However, after the Prefectural Committee sent a working group to inspect, it was found that the ending of land reform was not thorough at all, and the phenomenon of half-cooked rice was very serious. In some villages, feudalism had not been completely eliminated, and the demands of the poor and hired peasants had not been adequately met. For example, in Nanliushan Temple, the masses were not mobilized, the policies could not be implemented, the village cadres' stance was unstable, and they took care of the landlords very considerately, resulting in major errors. When distributing houses, branch secretary Hou Yuting, with a family of five, wanted a quadrangle courtyard with ten large brick rooms. Another branch committee member, Sun Fengshan, with a family of four, was given a courtyard with brick rooms, while poor peasants who lacked housing were not given any. Some poor peasants went to ask, and village cadre Sun Fengshan said, "You spoke too late, someone else wanted it." Poor peasant Duan Gengshun, with a family of five, only had a very dilapidated small house and was given a set of houses belonging to landlord Sun Hongru, but landlord Sun Hongru put on a fake pitiful appearance and "complained" everywhere. The village cadres even came out to "mediate" and said to Duan Gengshun, "Don't take that set, tear down three rooms from his house and build them in your own yard." At that time, because Duan Gengshun's awareness was not high, he agreed. Later, Duan Gengshun felt that he could not afford to build it himself even if he tore down the bricks, so he went to the village cadres to talk about it, and the village head said, "You agreed, why are you going back on your word?" In this way, the fruits already obtained by the poor peasants were returned to the landlords. This time, when settling the landlords and rich peasants, they bought a large ox for three landlord families, while some poor peasants only got one donkey leg. The village cadres completely lost their stance and made serious right-leaning errors. The main reason for these problems is that some county and district cadres have the idea of being eager to achieve quick results and lack sufficient understanding of the need to further and correctly implement the Party's policies in ending land reform and issuing land certificates, forming the idea of issuing land certificates for the sake of issuing land certificates, and neglecting to seriously correct policies and completely eliminate feudalism. On the other hand, it is because the district cadres neglected to conduct in-depth inspections in their leadership, simply relying on the joint meetings of village cadres to lead the work, only listening to the reflections of a few cadres, and lacking in-depth understanding of the situation from the broad masses, especially the poor and hired peasants.
　　After discovering this situation, the Ninth Prefectural Committee has instructed all county and district committees: In ending land reform and issuing land certificates, they must conduct thorough inspections, earnestly implement policies, ensure that one village is completed and done well, and cannot make half-cooked rice again. It is necessary to truly mobilize the masses and continue to fully complete the end of land reform.

### 冀中九地委指示　结束土改认真办不能再作“夹生饭”

　　冀中九地委指示
  　结束土改认真办不能再作“夹生饭”
    【本报讯】河北日报载：据九地委报导：肃宁七区结束土改工作很快完成。据区委说：七号前就全部完成了。但经地委派工作组去检查，却发现结束土改很不彻底，夹生饭现象很严重，有的村封建没有彻底消灭，贫雇农要求没适当满足。如南留善寺，未发动群众，政策不能贯彻，村干部立场不稳，照顾地主倒很周到，发生了重大错误。分房子时，支书侯玉亭五口人，要了一套四合子十间大砖房。另一支委孙凤山，四口人分了一套三合子砖房，贫农缺房的却没分到。有的贫农去问，村干部孙凤山说：“你说的晚了，有人要了。”贫农段庚顺，五口人，只有极破的一个小房，分得地主孙红如的一套房，地主孙红如却摆出一幅假可怜像，到处“诉苦”。村干部竟然出来“调解”，对段庚顺说：“你别要那一套了，拆他三间房，你盖在自己院里去吧。”当时因段庚顺觉悟不高，就答应了。后来段庚顺觉着拆了砖来自己也盖不起，便找村干部去说，村长说：“你答应了，为什么又反悔？”就这样把贫农既得果实又退回地主。这次安置地富，给三家地主夥买了一头大牛，而有的贫农，却只有一条驴腿。村干部完全失掉立场，产生了严重右倾错误。所以发生这些问题的原因，主要是有些县区干部有急于求成的思想，对结束土改发土地证必须进一步正确贯彻党的政策认识不足，形成了为发土地证而发土地证，忽视了认真端正政策，彻底消灭封建。另一方面是由于区干部在领导上忽视深入检查，单纯的依靠村干部联席会议去领导工作，只听少数干部反映，缺乏从广大群众尤其是贫雇农中去深入了解情况。
    发现了这种情况后，九地委已指示各县委区委：在结束土改发土地证中，必须切实深入进行检查，认真贯彻政策，保证作完一村作好一村，不能再作夹生饭。要切实发动起群众，继续全部完成结束土改。
