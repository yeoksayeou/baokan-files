Hejian Women's Federation Inspects Women's Work
  Mobilizes Women to Participate in Concluding Land Reform
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Hejian County Women's Federation of Central Hebei convened a meeting last month to summarize and inspect women's work in the concluding stage of land reform and party consolidation. Preliminary data from eleven key villages shows that the majority of women were mobilized to participate in the conclusion of land reform. Furthermore, sixty-one female representatives participated in party consolidation, all of whom actively helped party members correct their shortcomings. Through participating in party consolidation, many women raised their class consciousness and understanding of the Communist Party, and some actively requested to join the Party.
    In the central work, the women's organization was strengthened and expanded, and some unqualified female cadres were reformed. Statistics from eleven key villages show that 152 activists were discovered, of whom 48 participated in Party, government, and youth work, and 45 were elected as women cadres. Membership increased to 1,125. In Guo Village, District Nine alone, membership increased from 50 to 136.
    In mobilizing women, some districts paid attention to relieving women's own suffering, making them more active in their work. In the central work, most key villages paid attention to educating women on production, supporting the front, and attending winter school. Through education, the number of production groups increased. Sixteen villages now have twenty-four women's production groups, totaling 232 people. Seizing these natural production groups for education made them aware of the difficulties of illiteracy. After they had a demand, women's literacy classes were organized when production and learning were not delayed. Statistics from fourteen villages show that 45 groups with 261 people regularly participated in learning.
    The current shortcomings in women's work are: the organizational force has not been well promoted to complete the work in mobilizing women, and the cadres have taken on too much on their own, so some newly established organizations are not solid enough; the newly established literacy classes collapsed as soon as the cadres left. Some districts only focused on key villages, abandoning the leadership of women in general villages, forming a laissez-faire phenomenon.

### 河间妇联会检查妇女工作　发动妇女参加结束土改

　　河间妇联会检查妇女工作
  　发动妇女参加结束土改
    【本报讯】冀中河间县妇女联合会，上月召开会议总结检查结束土改整党中的妇女工作。据十一个重点村的初步情况，发动了大半数的妇女参加了结束土改。并有六十一名妇女代表参加了整党，都能积极的帮助党员改正缺点。经过参加整党，不少妇女提高了阶级觉悟和对共产党的认识，有些并积极要求入党。
    在中心工作中，并健全与扩大了妇女组织，改造了一些不称职的妇女干部。据十一个重点村统计：发现积极分子一百五十二个，其中四十八人参加了党、政青年工作，四十五人当选了妇女干部，会员增长到一千一百二十五个。光九区郭村就由五十个会员增长到一百三十六人。
    在发动妇女中，有的区注意了替妇女解除本身的痛苦。使她们在工作上更加积极起来。在中心工作中，多数重点村注意了对妇女生产、支前、上冬学的教育。经过教育，生产组增多了，十六个村现有二十四个妇女生产组，共二百三十二人。抓住这些自然生产组进行教育，使她们感觉到不识字的困难，等她们有了要求后，再在生产学习两不耽误的情况下，组织妇女识字班。十四个村统计有四十五组二百六十一人经常参加学习。
    当前妇女工作中的缺点是：在发动妇女中还没有很好的推动组织力量来完成工作，干部有些包办代替，因此一些新建立的组织不够巩固；新成立的识字班，干部一走就垮了台。还有些区只着重了重点村，放弃对一般村妇女的领导，形成自流现象。
