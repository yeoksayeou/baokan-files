　　Preventing Gambling During the New Year
  　Northern Yue Fourth Special District Office Issues Directive Banning Gambling
    [Northern Yue News] As the Lunar New Year approaches, the Fourth Special District Office issued a strict prohibition of gambling on the 16th of this month. The directive stated in brief: "Gambling is an extremely harmful vice. Our democratic government has repeatedly issued strict orders to ban it, but in some areas, there are still a few hooligans and unscrupulous individuals who disregard the law and gather to gamble in private. As the Lunar New Year approaches, some people, due to old habits that have not yet been eradicated, may follow suit and engage in gambling. If we do not take preventive measures, the gambling trend is likely to resurge. This will not only lead to difficulties in the lives of the masses and disrupt social order, but also have a significant impact on next year's production campaign. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly stop and prevent it early, so as to eradicate this bad habit." To this end, it is necessary to strengthen publicity and education among the masses to raise their political awareness; promote healthy cultural entertainment and encourage the masses to actively prepare for spring plowing during the Spring Festival. County governments should draft and widely post gambling ban notices, mobilize village cadres and the masses to supervise each other and consciously abide by them. County and district cadres must conduct in-depth inspections at any time. Gambling incidents must be dealt with promptly and seriously. Those who initiate gambling and those who repeatedly refuse to mend their ways should be severely punished, and this should be used to educate the masses.

　　防止年关赌风
  　北岳四专署指示禁赌
    【北岳讯】当旧历年关逼近，四专署特于本月十六日发出严禁赌博的指示，略称：查赌博恶风为害至巨，我民主政府早经屡次严令禁止，但各地仍有少数流氓不肖之徒，目无法令，私行聚赌。兹值旧历新年在即，有部分群众由于过去旧习尚未根除，亦会起而效尤，侧身赌场；如不预为防范，赌风极易复炽。若此则不仅招致群众生活的困难，妨害社会秩序的安宁，对明年生产运动亦将有莫大影响。因此必须认真制止及早防范，务使此种恶劣风气得以根绝。为此必须加强对群众的宣传教育，提高其政治觉悟；提倡正当的文化娱乐，鼓励群众在春节积极进行春耕准备。县府应拟制禁赌布告，广泛张贴，发动村干群众互相监督、自觉遵守；县区干部必须随时深入检查，发现赌博事件，须及时认真处理。对倡首者及屡劝不改分子应予严格处分，并以之教育群众。
