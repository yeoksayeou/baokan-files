　　Key Cadres Should Be Transferred in a Timely Manner, Promoting Progress Step by Step in a Wavelike Fashion
  　The Rectification of the Party and the Conclusion of Land Reform Achieve Progress in the Third District of Puyang County
    [Report from JiluYu by our correspondent Han Qing:] In the past few months, many counties in the JiluYu area have failed to properly utilize the "method of promoting progress step by step in a wave-like fashion with focus on key points." As a result, some county party committee members and even individual prefectural party committee comrades felt that under the conditions of a shortage of cadres and heavy tasks, it would be difficult to complete the Party rectification and end land reform work in 1948 during the autumn and winter seasons. By adopting the method of timely and gradual transfer of cadres and timely dissemination of experience, the Third District of Puyang County has initially solved this problem in the first half of December. The district has three sub-districts and eight townships. Each sub-district designated a key township, and each township designated a key village. Based on the existing cadres, several work groups of three to five people were formed, each group with a district committee leader, starting from several townships. The main strength of the work groups was concentrated in the key villages, while one or two general district cadres promoted the work in general villages. In general villages, a secondary key village was designated to avoid the problem of district cadres in general villages "running here and there" and accomplishing nothing, like "flying all over the sky." For example, the First Sub-district took Yangzhuang Township as the key township, and Yangzhuang as the key village of the township. Lu Kenan, the county party committee propaganda minister, Gao Guangwen, the district party committee secretary, Wang Jinsheng, the sub-district director, and others were responsible for the work in Yangzhuang, while district cadre Wang Shouming was responsible for the three general villages of Yangji, Qianhoudian, and Liuzhuang under the township's jurisdiction, and Yangji was designated as the secondary key village, with most of the effort focused on the work in that village. The district adopted three methods for promoting experience: First, Yangzhuang was the key village for the entire district. On the fourth day, when the village held a public branch meeting, the district committee notified district cadres from all townships and village cadres from all villages to participate for on-site learning. After the meeting, a review was conducted. Several village cadres believed that Yangzhuang's practice of immediately electing representatives after making the Party public was too hasty, and the masses had too little time to deliberate. After discussion, it was decided that other villages could, based on their specific circumstances, allow some time for deliberation before electing representatives. Second, district cadre meetings were held in each township to disseminate the Yangzhuang experience. For example, at the beginning of the work, a common problem in the leadership of each key village was that they believed that general party members were unwilling to make the Party public, and they repeatedly held meetings to get their ideas across. In fact, after a certain amount of education, those who were unwilling to make the Party public either no longer existed or only one or two remained. The leadership should no longer accommodate these individuals, as it would make the majority of party members feel that there were too many meetings and they would become fatigued. Yangzhuang first solved this problem and disseminated this experience at the district cadre meeting. As a result, Renlizhaozhuang, Limazhao, Chenzhuang, Yangji, and other villages successively made the Party public after Yangzhuang, breaking the stalemate in the work and moving forward. In addition, the district committee also temporarily convened village cadre meetings in general villages to disseminate the Yangzhuang experience. Third, after Yangzhuang had done some land measurement work, Wumachang, Fumachang, Chenzhuang, Limazhao, and other villages also began to measure land. Cadres from these villages came to Yangzhuang to learn land measurement experience. Because the villages were very close to Yangzhuang, experience could be exchanged in a timely manner, and the work in each village could proceed smoothly. In addition, the Third District also adopted the method of timely transfer of cadres. After the Yangzhuang branch was made public, a land measurement committee was established, winter schools were opened, and production was discussed. The work had already begun to gain momentum. Moreover, the village branch was relatively strong, and the branch committee members were actively responsible. The key village no longer needed so many cadres. Therefore, district secretary Gao Guangwen took the complete set of experiences from the first stage of work and transferred to Yangji, a general village, while district cadre Wang Shouming, who had originally focused on Yangji as the secondary key village, devoted most of his efforts to promoting the work in Qianhoudian and Liuzhuang. In this way, the work in the entire township broke through one after another within half a month. When the Ren Zhuang township district cadres in the First Sub-district publicly established the branch in the key village of Renzhuang and elected representatives, they also assigned a cadre to work in the general village of Luolou. These practices in the Third District of Puyang County mainly provide an experience in the timely transfer of cadres. In the past, many regions paid attention to the aspect of promoting experience and put forward many good practices, but they neglected the aspect of making cadres move in a timely manner. As a result, cadres in key villages stuck to the key villages until the end. At best, they could only connect the key villages with the general villages in terms of experience. For example, when key villages deployed, inspected, and summarized work, they would convene cadres from general villages to participate in order to absorb experience. However, when encountering different situations, different work steps, and different mass demands, there was no way to deal with it. Qingfeng and other counties encountered such problems. Even if the situations were generally the same, sometimes village cadres from general villages would either mechanically copy, fail to grasp, or fail to do anything after returning to the village, so the work still could not move forward. Therefore, most of them are limited to research and implementation on how to promote the experience of key villages to general villages, while neglecting the timely and gradual transfer of cadres, thus making it difficult to solve this problem. Now, Puyang has combined the dissemination of experience with the timely transfer of cadres, providing an important experience for solving this problem.
    Editor's note: The practice of "timely transfer of cadres, not sticking to key villages" is good. However, it should be noted that when cadres from key villages are transferred to secondary key villages, and cadres from secondary key villages are transferred to general villages, one should not neglect to understand the situation and avoid the problem of mechanical copying.

　　重点干部适时转移波浪式地逐步推广
  　濮县三区整党与结束土改获进展
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】记者寒青报导：在过去数月中，冀鲁豫区很多县份，未能很好运用“有重点的波浪式的逐步推广的方法”：致有一部分县委甚至个别地委同志，感到在干部缺少、任务繁重的条件下，难以在秋冬两季完成一九四八年的整党与结束土改工作。由于采取了干部适时逐步推移，经验及时传播的方法，濮县三区在十二月上半月的工作中，已初步解决了这一问题。该区有三个小区八个乡，每小区确定一重点乡，每乡确定一重点村，依据现有干部，组成若干三至五人的工作组，每组有一个区委领导，先从若干个乡做起。工作组的主要力量集中于重点村，而以一、二个一般区干部推动一般村，在一般村中，又确定一个次重点村，以避免一般村的区干，“这里跑跑，那里跑跑”，什么也做不出来的“满天飞”的毛病，如第一小区，即以杨庄乡为重点乡，杨庄为该乡重点村，县委宣传部长鲁克南、区委书记高广文、小区主任王金生等负责杨庄工作、区干王守明负责该乡所属的杨集、前后店、刘庄等三个一般村，而又以杨集为次重点村，以大部力量从事该村工作。该区推广经验的方法有三：第一、杨庄为全区重点村，四日，该村举行公开支部大会，区委会便通知各乡区干部以及各村村干参加，作实地学习。大会结束后，即进行检讨，若干村干部认为杨庄公开党后马上选代表的作法太仓促，群众酝酿时间太短，经过讨论，确定其他村可依据具体情况，酝酿一下，再选代表。第二、召开各乡的区干会议，传播杨庄经验。如工作开始时，各重点村领导上的通病是：认为一般党员不愿公开党，翻来复去地开会打通思想，实际上，经过一定的教育之后，不愿公开的或者已经不存在，或者只剩一、二人，领导上就不应再迁就个别人而使多数党员感到开会过多而呈现疲劳现象。杨庄首先解决了这一问题，在区干会上传播了这一经验。于是任李赵庄、李马桥、陈庄、杨集等村继杨庄之后，先后公开了党，打破了工作的胶着状态，前进一步。另外，区委会并临时召开一般村村干会议，传播杨庄经验。第三、当杨庄已经作了一段丈地工作之后，五马厂、驸马厂、陈庄、李马桥等村也开始丈地，各该村干部即来杨庄学习丈地经验。由于各村距杨庄很近，经验能够及时交流，各村工作便能顺畅进行。此外，三区更采取了干部适时推移的方法。杨庄支部公开之后，接着成立了丈地委员会，开办了冬学，讨论了生产，工作已经打开局面，加以该村支部较强，支委均积极负责，该重点村就不再需要那么多干部，于是，区书高广文即带着第一阶段工作的全套经验，转移至一般村杨集工作，而原来以杨集为次重点村的区干王守明，又以其大部力量推动前后店、刘庄之工作。这样，全乡工作便在半月之内相继突开。第一小区任庄乡区干，当重点村任庄公开支部、选出代表后，也分出一个干部到一般村罗楼工作。濮县三区的这些作法，主要地提供了一个干部适时推移的经验。在过去，不少地区是注意了推广经验的一面，并且提出了不少好的作法，但却忽视了使干部适时推移的一面，结果重点村干部死守重点到底，最好的也只能使重点村与一般村在经验上联系起来。比方重点村布置、检查、总结工作时，召集一般村的干部参加，以吸取经验，但遇上情况不同，工作步骤不同，群众要求不同时，就没有办法，清丰等县即曾碰到这样的问题。即使情况大体相同，有时一般村村干部回村之后，或则机械搬运，或则掌握不了，或则不作，致工作仍不能前进。因此，一般都是局限于重点村经验如何向一般村推广的研究与实施上，而忽视了干部适时的逐步推移，因此难于解决这一问题。现在，濮县已把经验的传播与干部的适时推移结合起来，给解决这一问题提供了一个重要的经验。
    编者按：“干部适时推移，不死守重点村”的做法是好的。但应注意，重点村干部推至次重点村，次重点村干部推至一般村，不要忽略了了解情况，避免发生械机搬运的毛病。
