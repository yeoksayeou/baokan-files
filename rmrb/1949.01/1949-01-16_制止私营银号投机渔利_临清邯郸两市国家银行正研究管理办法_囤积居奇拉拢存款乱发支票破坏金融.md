　　Curbing Speculative Profiteering by Private Banks
　  State Banks in Linqing and Handan are Studying Management Measures
　  Hoarding, Luring Deposits, Issuing Checks Recklessly, and Disrupting Finance

　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Private banks in Linqing and Handan have many malpractices, and it is urgent to strengthen management and rectification. There are two private banks in Linqing: one is called Fuxin Bank, and the other is called Gongyi Bank; there are also two private banks in Handan: one is called Yizeng Bank, and the other is Lianshang Bank (recently renamed "Mass Credit Cooperative"). The malpractices of these private banks are similar. (1) Conducting "warehouse" business in disguise or secretly, which is actually hoarding and speculating for profit. For example, the shareholders of Linqing Fuxin Bank are eight larger private merchants, each with their own businesses. They use their shops as cover to hoard goods. In October, a person named "Yichang" suddenly appeared on the market, issuing a check from Fuxin Bank, but there was no such business called Yichang in Linqing. According to the investigation, it was a fake name created by the shareholders of Fuxin Bank who bought goods, fearing exposure. Handan Yizeng Bank is more like a commercial firm. It often engages in buying and selling. It buys more when "inventory" is high and sells when funds are needed. In reality, it uses depositors' money to do its own business. When cotton prices rose in Handan in October, it bought three to four thousand catties of cotton. In particular, Lianshang Bank, mainly funded by party and government organs in Handan, took advantage of the tight money market and price declines in August when the state bank tightened the money supply to purchase more than three thousand catties of white oil. Private banks are not allowed to operate warehouse businesses, as clearly stipulated by the government long ago. Buying and selling goods is already illegal, and taking advantage of the state bank's tight money supply to speculate for profit is even more wrong. (2) Illegally luring public deposits. The government decided last summer that all public funds should be deposited in state banks, but private banks have never stopped luring and engaging in activities related to public funds. They use high interest rates, personal relationships, and private feelings to lure deposits. Recently, the Jinan Flour Factory received a deposit book from Handan Yizeng Bank, and individual state-owned enterprises and organs have disregarded national interests and deposited funds in private banks. For example, State-owned Xintaiji often deposits as much as 300 million yuan in Yizeng Bank, and the public-owned Taichang Goods Station deposited 10 million yuan in Lianshang Bank in October. In the accounts of Linqing Fuxin Bank, in addition to the "fixed deposit" and "current deposit" items, there is also a "miscellaneous deposit" item, which is a deposit from state-owned enterprises that they dare not publicly record in the accounts. Private banks in Handan are even more "sophisticated." The individual state-owned enterprise organs they lure to deposit funds do not call them deposits, but "transactions." When recording the accounts, they do not record the name of the organ, but use fake names or record personal names. (3) Borrowing checks and cleverly using the state bank's money to support their banks. For example, in mid-November, Linqing Fuxin Bank's various deposits and loans amounted to 130 million yuan, but in order to obtain more profits, it released more than 120 million yuan, with only 8 million yuan in reserve, accounting for only one-fifteenth of the total deposits. This is obviously not in line with bank regulations. What will it do if depositors come to withdraw money? It then uses private relationships to borrow other people's checks. For example, Chen Zhizhou, the manager of Shuanghecheng, has an overdraft relationship with the state bank, and Fuxin Bank borrowed the state bank's check from him, overdrafting 10 million yuan from the state bank and taking it to the bank to deal with depositors. Jiang Zijiu, the deputy manager of Fuxin Bank, also runs a business called Tianchanggong. He used this business to establish an overdraft relationship with the state bank. In November, he overdrafted 5 million yuan from the state bank, while depositing 10 million yuan in his Fuxin Bank. (This reporter believes that the state bank should stop lending and overdrafting to shareholders of private banks because they already have their own banks and can fully obtain these rights in their banks.) (4) Issuing checks indiscriminately. Linqing Fuxin Bank's checks circulate in the market for three or four days, and it takes advantage of the non-cash gap to profit. Because too many checks are issued and circulate in the market, they actually become "currency issuance," which causes "credit expansion" for the bank. The checks become "empty checks," causing losses to the check holders. On the one hand, it also expands the amount of currency in the market (check circulation is also currency), causing price instability. The government should restrict the circulation of bank checks and strictly regulate the circulation time to protect the interests of the vast number of merchants and stabilize finance. The state banks in these two places have discovered and begun to pay attention to these malpractices of private banks and are studying management and rectification methods. (Our reporter Tian Liu)

　　制止私营银号投机渔利
  　临清邯郸两市国家银行正研究管理办法
　  囤积居奇拉拢存款乱发支票破坏金融
    【本报讯】临清邯郸两市私营银号弊端很多，急应加强管理整顿。临清市有两个私营银号：一个叫孚信银号，一个叫公益银号；邯郸市也有两个私营银号：一个叫益增银号，一个是联商银号（最近改名为“群众信用社”）。这些私营银号发生的弊端都是类似的。（一）变相的或偷偷的进行“仓库”业务，实际上就是囤积居奇投机渔利。比如临清孚信银号的股东是八个较大的私商，都各有各的买卖，他们便利用自己的商铺作掩护，囤积货物。十月间市面上忽然发现具名“怡昌”者，开一孚信银号的支票，但临清市根本就没有怡昌这么一家字号。据调查是孚信银号股东们买了货，怕暴露而造的假名字。邯郸益增银号，不如说它是商号更合适些，他是经常作买卖的，“库存”多时就多买，需用款时再卖货。实际上是拿存款户的钱自己作买卖，十月间邯市棉花上涨时，就买了三、四千斤棉花。特别是由邯市党政机关资金为主的联商银号，当八月国家银行在紧缩货币时，它便利用市面银根吃紧，物价回缩的机会，购入白油三千多斤。私营银号不准经营仓库业务，早为政府明令规定。买卖货物已经非法，利用国家银行紧缩货币的机会，投机渔利更是错误。（二）非法拉拢公营存款。政府去年夏天已经决定公款一律存入国家银行，但私银号始终没有停止过对公款的拉拢和活动，他们用高利引诱、个人关系、私人感情种种办法拉拢。日前冀南面粉工厂就接到了邯市益增银号的存折，而且已经有个别公营企业机关不顾国家利益，竟把款存在私营银号里。比如国营新太记就经常在益增银号存款达三亿元，公营太昌货栈十月份向联商银号存款一千万元。临清孚信银号的帐目上，除了“定放”、“活存”项目外，尚有“杂存”一项，那是不敢公开写在帐目上的公营企业的存款。邯郸私人银号更“高明”，拉拢到的个别公营企业机关存款，不说存款，说是“往来”，记帐时不记机关名称，造假名或记人名。（三）借用支票，巧用国家银行的钱支持他的银号。如临清孚信银号十一月中旬各种存放款是一亿三千万元，但它为了获得更多的利润竟放出了一亿二千多万，只库存八百万元，仅及全部存款数的十五分之一，这显然是不合银行规定的，一旦存款户来取款它怎么办呢？他便去利用私人拉拢借用别人支票。如双合成经理陈之周与国家银行有透支关系，孚信银号便从他那里把国家银行的支票借了来，在国行透支一千万，拿到银号里去应付存款户。孚信银号的副经理蒋子举，自己还开着一座叫天昌公的买卖，他利用这个买卖在国家银行建立起透支关系，十一月里他向国行透支五百万元，同时却在他的孚信银号里存款一千万元（记者认为凡属私营银号的股东，国家银行应停止对他的贷款和透支关系，因为他已经有了自己银号，满可以在他的银号里获得这些权利。）（四）滥发支票。临清孚信银号的支票有在市场上流动三、四天者，它便利用不兑现空隙得利。因为过多的发出支票，而且在市场上流通，实际上就变成了“发行货币”，一方面使银号造成“信用膨胀”，支票变成了“空头支票”，使持支票的人受了损失，一方面也膨大了市场货币量（支票流通也是货币啊），造成物价不稳，政府应限制银号支票流通，最少应严格规定流通时间，以维护广大商民利益，稳定金融。私营银号的这些弊端，该两地的各国家银行已经发觉和开始注意，正研究管理和整顿办法。（本报记者田流）
