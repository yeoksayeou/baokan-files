Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 25th—During the unprecedentedly fierce and large-scale Huaihai Campaign, which lasted for two months and five days, millions of people enthusiastically and arduously supported the front lines, ensuring the great victory of annihilating more than 600,000 enemy troops. The frontline full-time civilian laborers, the second-line transportation civilian laborers, and the third-line temporary civilian laborers who directly participated in supporting the frontline work numbered in the millions. They included people from the three major liberated areas of East China, Central Plains, and North China. Among those the reporter met at the front were the Weihaiwei civilian labor fourth brigade, which had traveled more than 2,000 li from Jiaodong to reach the battlefield; the civilian laborers from the Fifth Sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu, who ground and transported 10 million jin of grain to the front in nine days despite wind and snow; the first batch of civilian laborers from Yu-Wan-Su, possessing over 10,000 stretchers and more than 100,000 personnel; the masses from newly recovered and newly liberated counties such as Xiao County, Tong County, and Su County; the civilian laborers from Haimen and Qidong areas near the Yangtze River; and the civilian labor teams from the Central Shandong area, who contributed the most to this campaign, totaling no less than one million people. With various accents and different styles of clothing, they drove carts, pack mules, pushed wheelbarrows, carried shoulder poles, and carried stretchers, continuously traveling along various transportation lines, day and night transporting supplies and ammunition to the People's Liberation Army and transferring the wounded.

　　At the beginning of the Huaihai Campaign, our hundreds of thousands of troops gathered around Xuzhou, and the daily consumption of military supplies was enormous, all of which needed to be transported from the distant rear. The Bohai First District alone mobilized more than 3,000 carts and more than 50,000 wheelbarrows. When our army annihilated the Huang Baitao Corps, grain had to be transported eastward along the Grand Canal. Disregarding the fatigue of long-distance transportation, the civilian laborers felt their way into the icy river in the dark and built pontoon bridges, ensuring that grain was continuously transported to the east side of the Grand Canal to supply our fighting army. Subsequently, the battle line quickly moved south, and our army advanced directly to the north of Bengbu, and then encircled and annihilated the Huang Wei Corps southwest of Su County. At this time, the Yu-Wan-Su and Central China civilian laborers simultaneously shouldered the heavy burden of military transportation. The Sixth Sub-district of Central China alone dispatched 28,000 wheelbarrows, more than 6,400 donkeys, 4,000 ox carts, and more than 200 sailboats. The stretcher team of the Fifth Sub-district of Yu-Wan-Su marched more than 700 li and completed eight transport missions in half a month. When our army marched 140 li in one night to pursue and encircle the three corps of the bandit Du Yuming's unit fleeing southwest from Xuzhou, the rear supply could not keep up for a while. More than 4,000 accompanying civilian laborers, under the leadership of more than 400 cadres, assisted local governments in raising grain in more than 400 villages, raising, requisitioning, and transporting more than three million jin of grain in four days. During the encirclement and annihilation of Du Yuming's bandit unit, tens of thousands of civilian laborers transported ample grain to our army, braving rain, snow, and severe cold. Civilian laborers from the Third Sub-district of Yu-Wan-Su insisted on carrying flour by hand in the rainy and snowy weather, traveling back and forth on muddy roads, supplying more than 320,000 jin of flour to fourteen units every day. The Junan wheelbarrow team from Shandong also transported grain in the snow from December 22nd to 25th, transporting more than 200,000 jin of grain in four days to supply the frontline troops. They tensely shouted slogans: "Whatever the front needs, we guarantee to deliver!" "Not afraid of the cold, learn from the frontline soldiers!"

　　The Use of Modern Means of Transportation is One of the Characteristics of the Campaign

　　In this Huaihai Campaign, the means of transportation that the People's Liberation Army could rely on, in addition to the largest amount of human and animal power, also used modern means of transportation—trains and automobiles—more than in the past, which is also one of the characteristics of this campaign. As early as before the start of this campaign, the people of Central Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Huaihai, and Fu-Yan districts repaired 2,250 kilometers of highways and 530 bridges in two months to allow military transport vehicles to pass. Railway workers were particularly active, repairing the Jinpu and Longhai railways day and night while the campaign was still in progress. By the beginning of this month, they had repaired the railways with Xuzhou as the axis, from Jinan to Su County and from Luoyang to Xin'an, with a total length of more than 2,000 li. All these efforts greatly strengthened the supply work at the front and saved a lot of human and animal power.

　　Women in the three major liberated areas also made great contributions to this Huaihai Campaign. Not to mention that they sewed millions of cotton clothes, socks, military shoes, and quilts, ensuring the soldiers' needs for warmth, just the amazing efforts they made to supply the People's Liberation Army with food in this campaign alone were astonishing. They sewed a large number of bags for transporting military grain, with women in the Bohai First District alone sewing more than 600,000. Women near the battlefield milled rice and ground flour. Even old ladies and young girls participated in pushing mills and grinding stones, with every family busy, day and night. Women in Junan completed the processing of more than 9 million jin of grain in three days, without sleeping for several nights in a row. When encircling and annihilating the Huang Wei Corps, several seriously wounded soldiers from a certain unit of our army crawled to the homes of villagers in Huangzhuang to rest. When the women in the village saw this, they braved the danger of artillery fire, immediately tied up stretchers, gathered a group of old ladies and young girls, carried these wounded soldiers, swaying back to our army's positions, and comforted the wounded soldiers, saying, "You are fighting the Kuomintang and bleeding for us, it is right to carry you." The wounded soldiers were moved to tears. One soldier said, "This is truly the People's Liberation Army's own mother!"

　　三大解放区数百万民工支援淮海战役功勋卓著
    【新华社中原廿五日电】在持续两个月又五天的空前激烈和空前大规模的淮海战役中，千百万的人民热情地艰苦地支援前线，保证了歼敌六十万余人的伟大胜利。直接参加支援前线工作的第一线常备民工、第二线转运民工以及第三线的临时民工，即达数百万人。他们包括了华东、中原、华北三大解放区的人民。记者在前线遇到的，就有从胶东跋涉二千余里而赶达战场的威海卫民工四大队，有冒着风雪在九天中将一千万斤粮食碾好并送上前线的冀鲁豫五分区民工，拥有担架万余付和人员十万余的豫皖苏第一期民工，有新收复和刚解放的萧铜、宿县等县的群众，有来自长江边的海门、启东地区的民工以及在此次战役中出力最大的总计不下一百万人的鲁中南区民工队。他们南腔北调，穿着式样不一，赶着大车、驮骡，推着小车，挑着担子，抬着担架，川流不息地沿着各交通线行进，夜以继日地为解放军输送给养、弹药、转运伤兵员。
    淮海战役之初，我数十万大军云集徐州四周，军需物资日耗甚巨，均需从远后方源源前运。仅渤海一区，即动员了三千余辆大车，五万余辆小车。当我军歼灭黄百韬兵团时，粮食要经运河东运，民工们不顾长途赶运之疲劳，在黑夜里摸到冰冷的河水中，架起浮桥，保证粮食络绎不断地运到运河东面，供应我作战大军。其后战线迅速南移，我军直薄蚌埠以北，接着又于宿县西南围歼黄维兵团，这时豫皖苏与华中民工便同时肩负起军运的重担，仅华中六分区，即出动了二万八千辆小车，六千四百余头驴子，四千辆牛车，二百余只帆船。豫皖苏五分区的担架团则远征七百余里，半月内完成了八次转运任务。及我军以一夜急行军一百四十里追围自徐州向西南奔逃的杜匪聿明所部三个兵团之时，后方供应一时接不上，四千余随军民工即在四百余干部的领导下，分向四百余村庄协助当地政府筹粮，在四天中即筹、征、运了三百余万斤粮食。在围歼杜聿明匪部期间，十数万民工冒着雨雪严寒，运输供给我军充裕粮食。豫皖苏三分区民工，在雨雪天中坚持人力扛面，往返于泥泞的路上，每日供给十四个单位三十二万斤以上的面粉。山东莒南小车团在十二月二十二日至二十五日间同样冒雪运粮、四天内运粮廿余万斤，供给第一线部队。他们紧张地喊出口号：“前方需要什么，我们保证送到什么！”“不怕寒冷，向前线战士看齐！”
　　使用近代交通工具是战役的特色之一
    在这次淮海战役中解放军所能依靠的交通工具，除了最大量的人力、畜力之外，还比较过去更多地使用近代交通工具——火车和汽车，这也是这次战役的特色之一。早在这次战役开始之前，鲁中南、苏北、淮海、阜盐等区人民即在两个月内修复了二千二百五十公里的公路和五百三十座桥梁，以便军运汽车通行。特别积极的是铁路工人，他们在战役尚在进行时即日夜赶修津浦、陇海两路，至本月初已修复了以徐州为轴心的自济南至宿县及自洛阳至新安的全长二千余里的铁路。所有这些努力的结果，大大加强了前线的供应工作，节省了许多人力畜力。
    三大解放区的妇女在这次淮海战役中也作了极大的贡献。不必说她们缝制了其数目各以百万计的棉衣、袜子、军鞋以及棉被，保证了战士们的御寒之需，单就此次战役中她们为供给解放军吃粮，即作了惊人的努力。她们为装运军粮而缝了大批袋子，仅渤海一区妇女，即缝了六十余万条。而邻近战地的妇女，则碾米、磨面，连老太婆小姑娘都参加推磨推碾，家家忙碌，昼夜不停。莒南妇女即在三天中完成加工粮九百余万斤，一连数夜未眠。在围歼黄维兵团时，我军某部几个重伤员爬到黄庄老乡家里去休息，村中妇女看见后，便冒着炮火危险，马上绑好担架，集合一伙老太太和小姑娘，抬着这些伤员，一摇一摆抬回我军阵地上，并安慰伤员们说：“你们为我们拚命流血打国民党，抬你们是应该的。”伤员们感动得流下泪来，一个战士说：“这真是人民解放军的亲娘！”
