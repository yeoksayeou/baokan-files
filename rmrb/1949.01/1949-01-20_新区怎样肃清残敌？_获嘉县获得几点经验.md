[Taihang News] How Can New Areas Clear Out Remaining Enemies?
　　Huojia County Gains Several Experiences
    [Taihang News] After the expansion cadre meeting in Huojia County, work in various districts has progressed, with significant results in clearing out remaining enemies. The Third District unearthed a chemical 82mm mortar, 20 rifles, 26 blunderbusses, 2 pistols, 60 rounds of ammunition, and 6 mortar shells. The Fifth District unearthed 21 rifles, 18 pistols, 700 rounds of ammunition, and 30 pistol rounds. The experiences of these two districts in clearing out remaining enemies and confiscating weapons are as follows:
    1. Convene meetings of families of puppet regime members, deeply explain policies, and resolve ideological issues. Zhang Shaosheng of Zhang Village hid after we liberated Huojia, not wanting to surrender his weapon. Cadres from the Third District went to his home and convened a family meeting. First, they explained the future of the family and his own crimes; then, they explained the reasons why Chiang Kai-shek was bound to fail and the People's Liberation Army was bound to win; combined with the family's interests, they clarified the Party's policies and attitudes; and pointed out his two possible futures. Under the persuasion of his whole family, Zhang Shaosheng surrendered his pistol. 2. Go deep among the masses to discover clues: Because the masses hate them, as long as you go deep among the masses, you can discover problems. We must combine this with the masses' own interests and explain the significance of clearing out remaining enemies. The Fifth District achieved such results because it paid attention to this point. 3. Disintegrate and break down the lower ranks of the remaining enemies, and enlighten their class consciousness. Most of the lower-level personnel of the enemy and puppet regimes come from poor families. Some of them joined the enemy in the past because of poverty; others were forced to join (a few were bad). These people should be given education on the situation and their future, and our attitude of serving the masses should be made clear to them, so that they realize that they were deceived by the Kuomintang and the landlords. Using them to understand the situation of the remaining enemies and colluding with their companions is also one of the methods for clearing out the remaining enemies. 4. Use the internal contradictions of the enemy and puppet regimes to expose the worst elements. Cao ××, the puppet township head of Taishan Temple, hid and refused to surrender his weapon after contacting us and registering. Cadres from the Third District used his internal contradictions and learned from another squad about the location of 21 rifles and 6 pistols, and recovered all of them. The Third District used Wu Shi'en, the squad leader of Zhonghe Township, to reveal Gao Shizhong's machine gun and six rifles. Jia Mingqi of Tianlou in the Third District served as a guard squad leader, company commander, etc., and did a lot of bad things. Our cadres talked with him, pointed out his past crimes and future prospects, and called on him to perform meritorious service for the people to atone for his past sins. In this way, he colluded with his accomplices and surrendered four rifles and one pistol. (Ji Peizhi)

　　新区怎样肃清残敌？
  　获嘉县获得几点经验
    【太行讯】获嘉县扩干会议后，各区工作都有进展，在肃清残敌工作上收效很大。三区搞出化学八二迫击炮一门，长枪二十枝，抉枪二十六枝，手枪二枝，子弹六十发、炮弹六个。五区搞出步枪二十一支，手枪十八枝，子弹七百发，手枪子弹三十发。该两区肃清残敌缴出武器的经验如下：
    一、召开伪属家庭会议，深入解释政策，打通思想。张庄张绍生在我解放获嘉后，即隐蔽下来，不想缴枪。三区干部即到他家召开家庭会议，首先讲明北家人的前途和他本人的罪恶；再说明蒋介石必败，人民解放军必胜的理由；结合其家庭利益表明我党的政策与态度；指出他的两条前途。这样在其全家劝说下，张绍生的一枝手枪缴出来了。二、深入群众，发现线索：因为群众痛恨他们，所以只要深入群众，就能发现问题，我们要结合群众本身利益，说明肃清残敌的意义。三、五区获得如此成绩，就是因为注意了这一点。三、分化瓦解残敌下层，启发他们的阶级觉悟。敌伪下层人员大部家庭贫寒，以前投敌的动机，有的是出于生活穷困；有的是被抓走（也有少数坏的）；对这些人应给予形势和前途教育，表明我为群众服务的态度，使他们认识过去是上了国民党和地主的当，通过他们去了解残敌情况，并串通他的同伴，也是肃清残敌方法之一。四、利用敌伪内部矛盾，揭发最坏的。太山庙伪乡长曹××，和我接头登记后，即躲起不愿缴枪。三区干部利用其内部矛盾，在另一个中队探知二十一条步枪和六支手枪的存放地，就全部搞出来了。三区利用中和乡分队长吴世恩说出了高世忠的一挺机枪、六枝步枪。三区田楼贾明起历任卫士分队长、连长等职，作过不少坏事，我干部经过和他谈话，指出他过去的罪恶，及今后前途，号召他为人民立功，以赎前罪。这样他串通了他的同伙缴出长枪四枝手枪一支。　　　　　　　　　（吉佩祉）
