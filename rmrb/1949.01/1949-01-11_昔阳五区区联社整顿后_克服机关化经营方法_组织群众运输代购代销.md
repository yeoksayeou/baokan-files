　　Taihang News: After rectification, the Wuxiang Fifth District Cooperative of United Societies overcame bureaucratic business management methods and began to organize the masses for transportation through its business operations. The first step was to absorb and promote local products based on the local production situation, exchanging them for the daily necessities of the masses. According to statistics of business turnover in October and November, more than 2,000 jin of hemp from local products were absorbed and transported to Xingtai, along with more than 3,600 jin of raw and cooked iron, more than 3,400 jin of medicinal materials, and more than 5,700 jin of coal, as well as melon seeds, scrap copper, etc. The transportation of these goods involved more than 100 head of livestock and about 40 people, with the masses earning more than 17,000 yuan (new currency) in freight fees. More than 1,800 jin of cotton, more than 800 jin of cotton seed husk, and more than 6,900 jin of salt were transported back, involving 155 head of livestock and 59 people, with the masses earning a total of more than 21,000 yuan in freight fees. This not only found transportation routes for the local masses but also developed business. Secondly, the Cooperative concentrated funds, unified procurement, and supported village cooperatives through business. Based on the principle of mutual benefit, the district cooperative purchased goods from village cooperatives at prices higher than the market price. When purchasing goods from outside, the Cooperative notified the village cooperatives in advance about what goods they wanted to purchase, so the Cooperative could make unified purchases. This helped the village cooperatives sell their goods, saved labor, and drove peddler production. Thirdly, absorbing the goods transported back by the masses solved the district cooperative's difficulty of having small funds. The masses could sell the goods they transported back from outside to the district cooperative in time to transport more. Sometimes, if the district cooperative could not pay cash immediately, it could accept the goods and pay later, thus achieving timely turnover of goods.

　　昔阳五区区联社整顿后
  　克服机关化经营方法
  　组织群众运输代购代销
    【太行讯】昔阳五区区联社经过整顿，克服了机关化的业务经营作法，开始通过业务，组织群众运输。首先是根据本地生产情况，吸收与推销当地土产，换回群众日常必需品。据十、十一两个月业务周转的统计，吸收本地土产运往邢台麻皮二千余斤，生熟铁三千六百余斤，药材三千四百余斤，石炭五千七百余斤，另有瓜子、废铜等。这些货物的运输，共组织了一百多头牲口，四十来人，群众得脚力费一万七千多元（新币·下同）。从外运回棉花一千八百多斤，花穰八百余斤，食盐六千九百余斤，共组织牲口一百五十五头，五十九人，群众共得脚费二万一千余元。这样不但给当地群众找到了运输门路，而且也开展了业务。其次是集中资金，统一采购，通过业务扶助村社。区社根据两利原则，高于市价收买村社货物。出外购买贷物时，事先通知各村社，要购什么货，可由区社统一采购。这样帮助村社推销了货物，也节省了劳力，带动了小贩生产。第三、吸收群众运回的货物，解决了区社资金小的困难。群众从外运回货物，可及时卖给区联社再去运。有时区社不能马上付现款，也可将货收下，延期补给。这样达到了货物及时周转。
