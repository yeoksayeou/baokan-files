Comrades Shi Min and Wei Rong from the Zuoquan County Party Committee Office, reporting on their experience in concluding land reform and rectifying the Party, stated: Because the conclusion of land reform and Party rectification in Majialou Village emphasized education on concluding land reform but neglected ideological mobilization inside and outside the Party, failing to grasp the main demands of the masses, the movement started strong but then slackened. The root cause of this situation was mainly the fear of addressing problems promptly, fearing it would create emotions against rectification and cadres. However, they failed to recognize that the work of concluding land reform could transform and educate Party members; they only knew that concluding land reform would lay the foundation for Party rectification, failing to realize that laying the foundation requires solving specific problems to adjust the relationship between the Party and the masses. Therefore, they only paid attention to understanding problems without the determination to solve them. In rectifying the farmers' association, only most of the smaller problems were solved, while the major problems were not. They thought that after understanding the situation, they could solve them in the next phase, harboring a task-oriented viewpoint. Now, they have begun to shift according to this spirit. They first held a branch meeting, summarized the twenty days of work on concluding land reform, and allowed Party members in the branch to examine achievements, shortcomings, and transformations. This is actually praising the good, establishing righteousness within the Party, criticizing shortcomings, and combating evil influences. Relying on active elements in the branch to carry out internal Party struggle. For example, Li Dasi, who in the past was indifferent to work and did not care about things, has also actively worked in this movement, which is a good sign, but the transformation is not significant. The former public security director has consistently had a bad style, engaging in corruption and forming small cliques, colluding with the director of the military committee and the village head, saying that there is no good outcome for doing work, but we also exposed this in summarizing twenty days of work, launching model commendations and error criticism.

    结束土改中没有抓住群众主要要求
  　左权马家楼村工作的教训
    左权县委办公室世民、维荣二同志报导结束土改与整党的经验时称：由于马家楼村结束土改与整党偏重了结束土改教育，忽视了党内外思想发动，抓不着群众主要要求，结果运动先紧后松。造成这种情况的根源主要是发现问题不敢及时解决，唯怕造成整党与反对干部情绪，但没有认识到在结束土改工作中来改造与教育党员；只知结束土改是打下整党基础，更不知打下基础必须解决具体问题，才能调整党群关系，所以只注意去了解问题，没决心去解决问题。在整顿农会时只解决了大部较小问题，大问题就没有解决，在思想上认为了解情况后等下期再解决，存在一种任务观点。现已根据此种精神进行转变，先开了支部会，总结了二十天结束土改工作，在支部里让党员们展开查成绩、查缺点、查转变，这实际上是表扬好的，树立党内正气。批评缺点，打击邪气。依靠支部积极分子，开展党内斗争。如李大四过去对工作是不闻不问，对事不管的，开始在运动中大家给他提出来这次也积极工作起来了，这是好的表现，但转变不大。旧公安主任一贯作风不好，贪污腐化，搞小集团拉拢武委会主任、村长，说干工作没下场，但我们在总结二十天工作，展开表模批评错误中，也揭发出来了。
