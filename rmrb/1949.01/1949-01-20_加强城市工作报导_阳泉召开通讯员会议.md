Strengthen City Work Reporting
Yangquan Holds Correspondent Meeting

[Yangquan News] In order to actively respond to the People's Daily's call for opening a city edition and strengthening reporting on industrial workers, the Propaganda Department of the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee pre-selected 37 cadres from various organs and factories who were responsible or capable of writing, and appointed them as special correspondents after review by the Municipal Party Committee, to serve as the backbone and core of the Yangquan City's communication work.

A special correspondent meeting was held on the 10th of this month to study communication work. Comrade Ren Puwen of the Municipal Party Committee personally presided over the meeting. Comrade Puwen, in reviewing the communication work of Yangquan City last year, strictly examined the main reasons why this work could not be carried out. It was because the cadres' thinking was not clear on the principle of "the whole party runs the newspaper." Therefore, he emphasized that we must resolutely implement the principle of "the whole party runs the newspaper" ideologically and in leadership, use practical actions as a measure for all party members and cadres, and called on everyone to accept this glorious political task actively and happily.

In addition, a preliminary plan on how to strengthen communication work in the future was put forward for everyone to study. At the same time, according to the progress of various tasks in Yangquan City, 13 special topics were drafted as the focus of reporting for the first phase (January 10 to February 15). The special correspondents present at the meeting were responsible for reporting separately through self-reporting and public discussion. During the meeting, everyone展开ed a lively discussion based on the plan, put forward many specific methods and opinions, which were summarized by the Municipal Party Committee as a decision, the content is as follows:

(1) In order to implement the principle of "the whole party runs the newspaper," the branches, factories, and district committees of various organs and factories should include communication work on the agenda of leadership work. Communication work and cadre study should be an indispensable part of all work arrangements, group meeting inspections, and all work reports of various departments and party committees.

(2) In order to improve the communication work, establish a reward and punishment system. The Propaganda Department will regularly summarize the communication work, with commendation and criticism. Branch life should also include communication work as one of the contents of criticism and commendation. Cadres who have served as correspondents should have this item in their appraisals.

(3) Methods and content of writing communications: 1. Emphasize that the principal leaders take the lead and do it themselves, promote everyone, and promote collective research and collective creation. Leaders must recognize this work as a part of their leadership work, otherwise everyone will not think that it is one of their duties to be completed. Reports of important, guiding or specialized significance should be written by the responsible cadres of the department. If a suitable cadre can be designated to write, the responsible cadre must also be responsible for review and revision. 2. Implement the method of "write communications after doing work, do work after reading communications," and use daily work and central work as the content of reporting. For reports of important meetings, the responsible cadres of the department should formulate a reporting plan and designate a specific person to report. 3. In addition to the Propaganda Department being responsible for contacting the newspapers and proposing the key points of reporting for each period according to the general situation of the city, various departments must also formulate reporting plans in a timely manner according to the specific situation of the department. 4. In order to study comprehensive, guiding and important reports, each unit must establish a central group of responsible cadres from the Party, government, and labor union to facilitate mastering the overall situation, with the administrative responsible comrade as the group leader and the secretary-general as the deputy group leader, in order to help the group leader propose the key points of reporting, discover problems, and designate a special person to be responsible for reporting. And assist in receiving and sending manuscripts to prevent "客里空", conduct general reviews, or distribute important manuscripts to the relevant department leaders for review according to their nature, as well as return manuscripts, etc. In addition to the central group, a general group should be formed by designating appropriate cadres with writing ability. Those who voluntarily participate should be welcomed and absorbed. If it is not possible to establish a central group, a special person must be designated to be responsible for this work. 5. In terms of reporting forms, write more systematic comprehensive reports and summary reports. When necessary, the Municipal Party Committee will adopt the "point general method" to designate a special person to report. The designated comrades must accept the task unconditionally, otherwise they should be criticized by the Party committee.

　　加强城市工作报导
  　阳泉召开通讯员会议
    【阳泉讯】为积极响应人民日报开辟城市版和加强产业工人报导的号召，阳泉市委宣传部预先拟定各机关、工厂负责或有写作能力的干部三十七人，经市委审查聘为特约通讯员，做为阳泉市通讯工作中的骨干与核心。
    本月十日召开特约通讯员会议研究通讯工作，会议由市委任璞紊同志亲自主持，璞紊同志于回顾去年阳泉市通讯工作中，严格检查了这一工作不能开展的主要原因，是在于干部思想对“全党办报”方针认识不明确，因此强调指出，必须从思想上、领导上坚决贯彻“全党办报”方针，以实际行动做为全体党员干部检查尺度，并号召大家积极的、愉快的接受这一光荣政治任务。
    此外，并提出今后如何加强通讯工作的初步方案供大家研究，同时根据阳泉市各种工作进度，拟定十三个专题为第一期（一月十日至二月十五日）报导重点，以自报公议办法由到会特约通讯员分别负责报导，会中大家根据方案展开热烈讨论，提出许多具体办法和意见，经市委汇集总结做为决定，内容如下：
    （一）为贯彻“全党办报”方针，各机关、工厂支部、区委应将通讯工作列为领导工作议事日程之一，凡在布置一切工作中；小组会检查中，以及各部门各党委的一切工作报告中通讯工作与干部学习都应成为不可缺少的内容。
    （二）为使通讯工作前进提高，建立奖惩制度，宣传部定期总结通讯工作，要有表扬有批评，支部生活也应将通讯工作列为批评表扬内容之一，担任过通讯工作的干部做鉴定时应有此一项。
    （三）写通讯的方法和内容：一、强调首长负责亲自动手，推动大家，并发扬集体研究、集体创作、领导必须承认这一工作为其所领导工作之一部，否则大家不会认为是自己应完成的分内任务之一部，凡重要意义的，指导性或专门性的报导应由部门负责干部亲自写，如能指定适当干部写时，而负责干部也必须负审查修改之责。二、贯彻“做了工作写通讯，看了通讯做工作”的方法，以日常工作、中心工作做为报导内容，重要会议报导则由部门负责干部拟定报导计划并指明专人报导。三、除宣传部负责与报社联系，并根据本市一般情况，提出每个时期报导要点，各部门也必须根据部门具体情况，及时拟定报导计划。四、为研究全面性、指导性及重要意义之报导，各单位务须建立党、政、工负责干部中心小组，便于掌握全盘情况，以行政负责同志为组长，秘书长为副组长，以便帮助组长提出报导要点，发现问题。指定专人负责报导，并帮助收发稿件以防“客里空”，进行一般审查，或重要稿件视其性质分发各有关部门领导审查，以及退发稿件等任务。除中心小组外，指定有写作能力的适当干部组一普通小组，有自愿参加者应采取欢迎态度吸收，如不可能建立中心小组也必须指定专人负责这一工作。五、报导形式多写有系统的综合性报导和总结性报导，必要时市委采取“点将法”指定专人报导，被指定同志须无条件接受任务，否则应受到党委批评。
