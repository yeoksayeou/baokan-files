　　Manager Unjustly Fires Shop Assistant
  　Union Mediation Leads to Reinstatement
    [Yangquan City News] At Yu Shun Zhan on Xinshi Street, shop assistant Zheng Honggong was unjustly fired. After mediation by the trade union, he was reinstated. On November 17th, Zheng Honggong had an argument with another shop assistant over the use of a kitchen knife. Manager Liu Xishan, without clarifying the cause of the argument, fired Zheng. Zheng felt it was unfair to be fired for arguing over work duties, so he went to the shop's trade union. The trade union convened a meeting with people from Yu Shun Zhan. Everyone agreed that Zheng was acting in the interest of the shop, not for himself, and that the manager's dismissal of Zheng was wrong; the person who argued was also at fault and should have discussed things calmly. Both parties agreed to accept criticism. Manager Liu agreed to let Zheng return and said, "It was wrong of me to fire Lao Zheng at the time. Actually, my counter can't do without him." He even proposed that Zheng be paid his salary as usual for the two days he was absent. After the meeting, Zheng also said, "This time the trade union solved my problem for me, it's good to have an organization. I will definitely work hard when I return to the counter."

　　经理无故开除店员
  　工会调解后复工
    【阳泉市讯】新市街裕顺栈，无故开除店员郑洪共，经工会调解后又复工。十一月十七日，郑洪共为使用菜刀，和另一个店员吵架，经理刘锡山不问清吵架原因，就把郑开除。郑觉得为职务吵架被开除有些冤，就找店员工会，工会就找裕顺栈的人开了个会，大家都认为郑是为了店方不是为自己，经理开除郑是不对的；吵架的人也不对，有事应该慢慢商量。双方都同意了批评，刘经理同意让郑再回来，并说：“我当时开除老郑是不对的，其实我这柜上也离不开他。”他自己还提出郑离开的这两天照旧发给工资。会后郑也说：“这回工会给我解决了问题，还是有个组织好。我回柜一定努力工作。”（文光、张义）
