　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The "Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations for the North China Region," passed by the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference, were promulgated and implemented by the North China People's Government on December 25th of last year. The original text is as follows:

Chapter I: General Principles

Article 1: These tax regulations are formulated based on the post-land reform situation where rural land is largely equally distributed, in accordance with the principles of developing agricultural production, ensuring wartime supply, and making farmers' burdens reasonable and fixed.

Article 2: These tax regulations adopt a single tax system with a tax-free threshold and proportional taxation.

Article 3: All land with agricultural income shall be subject to agricultural tax paid by the owner, except as otherwise provided in these tax regulations.

Agricultural tax on mortgaged land shall be paid by the mortgagee.

Agricultural tax on leased land shall be paid by the lessor.

Article 4: The following types of land are exempt from agricultural tax:

(1) House foundations, threshing grounds, land occupied by roads, canals, riverbeds, riverbanks, and other land that cannot be cultivated.

(2) Wasteland. However, this does not apply to land that is barren due to negligence in cultivation.

(3) General woodland. However, land converted from cultivated land to woodland shall be taxed at 30% of the normal annual yield of the cultivated land.

(4) Publicly operated farms, forest farms, and nurseries used for experimental promotion purposes.

Article 5: The following types of land may be exempted from agricultural tax for a certain period:

(1) Newly reclaimed wasteland or newly built mountain land and terraced fields are exempt for three years; wasteland that has been fallow for more than six years is considered virgin wasteland.

(2) Land reclaimed from fallow land is exempt for two years.

The term "fallow land" in the preceding paragraph refers to cultivated land that has been out of cultivation for three to five years.

(3) Newly formed river滩land in mountainous areas is exempt for three years from the year of harvest.

(4) Rotating cultivated land is exempt for the year it is not cultivated.

Chapter II: Unit of Calculation for Cultivated Land – Standard Mu

Article 6: The unit of calculation for cultivated land in these tax regulations is designated as "Standard Mu." Land that normally yields ten *shi* of grain is considered one Standard Mu. For those exceeding or falling short of ten *shi* of grain, one *dou* is converted to one-tenth of a Standard Mu, and one *sheng* is converted to one-hundredth of a Standard Mu; amounts below *sheng* are not counted.

The term "normal annual yield of grain" in the preceding paragraph refers to the yield that various cultivated lands should harvest in a normal year based on the locally customary main grain crops planted.

Grains other than grains are calculated by converting their yields to grain.

Article 7: If the yield of the same land exceeds the normal yield of similar land due to planting "special crops" or intensive cultivation, the excess will not be counted more. If the yield is less than the normal yield of similar land due to negligence in cultivation, it will not be counted less. The Standard Mu shall be converted according to the normal annual yield of similar land.

Article 8: If the land grade is improved and the normal annual yield is increased due to land improvement of the same grade of land, the revision of its Standard Mu shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions:

(1) Changing dry land to paddy fields by digging canals and wells, the Standard Mu will not be revised within three years. From the fourth year onwards, the Standard Mu will be revised according to the normal annual yield after the land grade is improved.

If the land improvement expenses incurred by digging canals or wells in the preceding paragraph are not sufficiently compensated by the increased yield within three years, an application may be submitted to the county government to extend the time limit for revising the Standard Mu.

(2) For repairing abandoned canals and wells and restoring paddy fields, the Standard Mu will not be revised within two years. From the third year onwards, the Standard Mu will be revised according to the normal annual yield after the paddy fields are restored.

Article 9: Orchards, mulberry gardens, bamboo gardens, mountain products, and lotus ponds shall be calculated as Standard Mu by converting 50% of their total income into grain, based on their normal annual yield, with reference to the average wholesale price during the harvest and sales season.

Chapter III: Tax-Free Threshold and Deduction for Livestock Consumption

Article 10: All agricultural population, except as otherwise provided in these tax regulations, shall deduct a tax-free threshold of one Standard Mu per person, regardless of gender or age, and shall be exempt from burden.

Article 11: In any of the following circumstances, the tax-free threshold may be appropriately increased with the approval of the county government upon assessment by the village government.

(1) Widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless who lack labor power, are from poor families, and have difficulty living.

(2) Family members of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and martyrs who lack labor power, are from poor families, and have difficulty living.

Article 12: The deduction of the tax-free threshold for the following personnel shall be in accordance with the following provisions:

(1) Revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and martyrs shall have their tax-free threshold deducted in their own homes.

(2) Female workers who have left production may, after marriage, deduct the tax-free threshold at either the husband's house or the mother's house at their own discretion, but only if there is a formal notification from their affiliated organization. In the absence of a formal notification, the deduction shall be made at the husband's house.

(3) Those who live by rotation shall negotiate which household will make the deduction.

(4) Permanent residents shall have the deduction made at the host's house.

(5) Hired laborers shall have the deduction calculated separately based on the time they eat in the employer's house and their own house. However, short-term day laborers shall not have the deduction made in the employer's house.

Article 13: The tax-free threshold shall not be deducted in any of the following circumstances:

(1) Those who are permanently away from home and whose living expenses are not provided by the family.

(2) Those who operate or concurrently operate industry and commerce and whose living expenses have already been deducted in industry and commerce.

(3) Those whose land is scattered in several places and has already been deducted elsewhere.

Article 14: Draft animals and their offspring may deduct consumption in accordance with the following provisions. However, livestock mainly used for transportation or exclusively for sale for slaughter shall not be subject to this provision.

(1) Cattle and donkeys shall deduct four-tenths of a Standard Mu per head.

(2) Mules and horses shall deduct seven-tenths of a Standard Mu per head.

Chapter IV: Burden Mu, Burden Amount, Collection, and Reduction

Article 15: The unit of collection for these tax regulations is designated as "Burden Mu." Each Burden Mu shall be taxed at twenty-five *jin* of millet per year; local grain funds (including village funds) may be additionally levied by the provincial government or administrative office within the scope of no more than five *jin* of millet per Burden Mu, subject to the approval of the North China People's Government.

The term "Burden Mu" in the preceding paragraph refers to the Standard Mu that remains after deducting the tax-free threshold and livestock consumption from all Standard Mu owned by a household, which is subject to the burden.

Article 16: In areas where the survey of land area and yield is not yet accurate, the burden amount specified in the preceding article may be appropriately adjusted and changed by the government above the county level based on the actual level of survey work in the area.

Article 17: After the burden amount of agricultural tax is determined, it shall be collected in two seasons, summer and autumn. In areas without a summer harvest, it may be collected in full in the autumn.

Article 18: In order to ensure supply and facilitate payment by the people, in addition to collecting grain, cash, cloth, cotton, firewood, straw, and other goods may also be converted for collection.

The types of converted collection and the conversion ratio shall be promulgated by the Finance Department of the North China People's Government through the provincial government or administrative office to the county government in charge of collection by order.

Article 19: Those who suffer from water, drought, insect pests, hail, or other disasters and have a poor harvest, making it truly difficult to pay according to the fixed burden amount, may have the county government in charge submit a detailed report of the disaster situation to the provincial government or administrative office for forwarding to the North China People's Government for approval to postpone, reduce, or exempt collection.

Chapter V: Investigation and Evaluation

Article 20: The land area (natural mu), normal annual yield, other land income, and the number of Standard Mu converted, population, and number of draft animals of each farm household, the tax-free threshold and livestock consumption to be deducted, and the remaining number of Burden Mu shall be truthfully entered by the head of the household in the Agricultural Tax Registration Form (Appendix 1 omitted), and reported to the village government. The village government shall organize an Agricultural Tax Investigation and Evaluation Committee (referred to as the Evaluation Committee) to investigate and evaluate in accordance with the relevant articles of these tax regulations.

Article 21: After the Evaluation Committee investigates and evaluates the items listed in the Agricultural Tax Registration Form reported by each farm household and determines them to be accurate, the village government shall list them and announce them. If the original report is untrue or incomplete, or if there are errors in the calculation, the Evaluation Committee shall revise it.

Article 22: If a farm household has different opinions on the items listed on the announcement, it may submit reasons and apply to the village government to hand them over to the Evaluation Committee for review and re-evaluation. If the Evaluation Committee believes that the application is justified, it shall approve it and revise the relevant items in the registration form accordingly; if it believes that it is unjustified, it shall put forward the reasons and opinions for rejection.

The results of the review and re-evaluation in the preceding paragraph shall be formally notified to the applicant by the village government and announced in an appropriate place.

Article 23: If the applicant still has different opinions on the results of the review and re-evaluation, he/she may file an appeal with the county government within five days after receiving the formal notification from the village government. The county government shall immediately send personnel to investigate and make a ruling based on the actual situation.

Article 24: After the Agricultural Tax Registration Form of each farm household in the entire village has been investigated, evaluated, and determined, the village government shall immediately compile it into a Register of Agricultural Tax Registration for the village, write three copies, one to be kept in the village for reference, and two copies to be submitted to the district government and the county government for verification.

Article 25: If the county government and district government believe that the investigation and registration of land area, land yield, other land income, population, and draft animals in the Agricultural Tax Registration Register reported by the villages under their jurisdiction are not completely truthful and consistent, which affects the balance of the burden, they may designate the relevant districts and villages to organize a Joint Agricultural Tax Survey Committee to re-survey and evaluate.

Article 26: After the county government believes that the agricultural tax investigation and registration work in the county has reached an accurate level, it shall immediately write two copies of the Agricultural Tax Registration Register for the county (according to Appendix 2 omitted) and submit them to the provincial government or administrative office and the North China People's Government for verification. After being approved by the North China People's Government, the number of Standard Mu in the county shall be fixed. Except for revisions to the Standard Mu due to land improvement as stipulated in Article 8 of these tax regulations, and natural changes such as mountain floods, river changes, siltation, and sand pressure, no further changes shall be made. Changes in population, draft animals, and legal transfers of land shall be investigated and recalculated annually.

Chapter VI: Penalties

Article 27: Those who attempt to evade or underpay agricultural tax by concealing or underreporting land area, normal annual yield, and other land income, or falsely reporting the number of population and draft animals, shall be revised in accordance with the law and may also be fined an amount ranging from ten *jin* to three hundred *jin* of millet.

Village government chairmen, committee members, and Evaluation Committee members who violate the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall be subject to heavier penalties, and those who shield others shall be punished in the same way.

Article 28: Those who fail to pay agricultural tax within the time limit set by the county government without justified reasons shall, in addition to being pursued for payment within the time limit, be subject to a fine of 5% to 20% of the unpaid tax amount, depending on the circumstances.

Article 29: The right to impose penalties stipulated in the preceding two articles belongs to the government above the county level. Districts and villages may not exercise it.

Chapter VII: Supplementary Provisions

Article 30: These tax regulations apply to areas where land reform has been completed. In these areas, all previously promulgated agricultural tax regulations and other agricultural burden methods shall be abolished.

In areas where land reform has not yet been completed, the method of collecting agricultural tax shall be formulated by the provincial government or administrative office and submitted to the North China People's Government for approval and implementation.

Before this new method is implemented, the unified progressive tax, fair burden, reasonable burden, and other methods previously implemented in these areas shall be temporarily allowed to continue to be used.

Article 31: The detailed rules for the implementation of these tax regulations and the organizational regulations and evaluation regulations for the Village Agricultural Tax Investigation and Evaluation Committee and the Joint Agricultural Tax Survey Committee shall be formulated separately.

Article 32: The power to amend and interpret these tax regulations belongs to the North China People's Government.
