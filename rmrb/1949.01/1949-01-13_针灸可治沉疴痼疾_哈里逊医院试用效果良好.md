Acupuncture Can Treat Chronic and Stubborn Diseases
Harrison Hospital Experiences Good Results

Since 1946, when Comrade Zhu Lian served as the Director of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Health Bureau and the Director of Harrison Hospital, she noticed the lack of medicines and equipment, which caused many diseases to be prolonged and difficult to cure. Based on her previous experience with acupuncture in Yan'an, she advocated the use of acupuncture as a treatment method. Now, with the Health Bureau merged into the North China Government Health Department, the promotion of acupuncture has been going on for nearly three years. When it was first proposed, there was significant resistance from our medical staff. Some shook their heads and said, "This is not scientific at all." Others ignored it, expressing their contempt with indifference. Comrade Zhu, on the one hand, carried out persuasion, and on the other hand, personally practiced it in Harrison Hospital, using practical examples to educate everyone.

This treatment method not only saves medicines and materials and is particularly effective for many stubborn diseases, but also the masses are very familiar with it and are willing to accept this treatment, without the fear of "foreign injections." Now all the doctors and nurses in the North China Government Health Bureau and Harrison Hospital have learned this treatment method. Some comrades, when they themselves are sick, also request this method for treatment. This shows that the comrades have experienced the good effects of acupuncture.

Just the statistics of acupuncture treatments in the recent three months can illustrate the good effect of acupuncture. During this period, the number of people treated with acupuncture was 284, with a total of 1,506 visits. 162 people were completely cured, accounting for one-third of the total number of cured cases in all departments. Excluding those whose condition was alleviated or partially recovered after acupuncture, taking only these 162 fully recovered patients, they did not spend a penny on medicines. If medicines were used, at a cost of 10,000 Jiao per person (in Jireh currency), 162 people would cost 1,620,000 Jiao.

Now, let's introduce a few actual clinical examples:

One, patient Zhang Jinhua, female, 25 years old, from Yangxizhi Village. Chief complaint (main symptoms stated by the patient): discomfort in the stomach, numbness throughout the body. Symptoms: When the illness is about to occur, she first feels numbness throughout her body, then feels ball-like objects bulging in her limbs, spasms in her limbs, shortness of breath, palpitations, staring blankly with both eyes, and confusion of consciousness. Diagnosis: Hysteria (loss of mind). Treatment: Acupuncture treatment started on June 4th. The first acupuncture points were Xinshu and Hegu (these are all acupuncture point names), and the patient felt nothing. The second time, Neiguan, Shenmen, and Dazhui were needled. An attack occurred on the 7th. The third time, Jianyu, Quchi, and Hegu were needled, and she felt relaxed. The fourth time, Zhongwan and Zusanli were needled, and she felt an increase in appetite and more comfortable in spirit. The fifth time, Neiguan, Xinshu, and Jianyu were needled, and palpitations and shortness of breath were reduced. The sixth time, Quchi and Zusanli were needled, and numbness in the limbs was reduced. After that, Xinshu, Shenmen, Hegu, Quchi, Zusanli, and other acupoints were re-needled every other day, for a total of 21 times. The above symptoms were gradually reduced to the point of disappearing, and the hysteria stopped occurring.

Two, patient Li Chunyi, male, 38 years old, from Wangmu Village, Pingshan. Chief complaint: Pain in the waist and legs, motor impairment. Symptoms: He contracted this disease after suffering from typhoid fever two years ago. His waist and legs often ache, and movement has become impaired. The waist has become stiff, and the flexion and extension of the lower limb joints are also not free. The pain worsens with cloudy and rainy weather. Diagnosis: Lumbago rheumatism. Treatment: Acupuncture treatment started on July 24th. The first acupuncture points were Dachangshu and Shangjiao, and he felt nothing. The second time, Cijiao, Huantiao, and Weizhong were needled, and he felt his steps were lighter, but movement was still impaired. The third time, Ashi and Huantiao were needled, and the waist and legs felt more relaxed, and the pain was greatly reduced, but bending over was still restricted. The fourth time, Ashi and Xiajiao were needled, and the waist was able to move, and he was able to bend down slowly. The pain was very slight. Later, Ashi, Xiajiao, Fujie, Huantiao, Shangjiao, Zusanli, and others were continuously needled. The waist was able to bend and move, and the pain symptoms no longer existed. A total of ten treatments were given, and he was completely cured.

Three, patient Su Laishu, female, 10 years old, from Yezhuang Village, Pingshan. Chief complaint: Generalized seizures occur every ten days to half a month. Her father has a history of epilepsy. Symptoms: It occurs about every half month to ten days. During an attack, she suddenly falls to the ground, her teeth are tightly closed, her limbs and head are stiff, she foams at the mouth, her tongue is often bitten and bleeds, her consciousness is completely lost, and she appears very tired after waking up. Treatment: Acupuncture treatment started on August 5th. The first acupuncture points were Dazhui and Hegu. An attack occurred on the evening of the 8th. The second time, Hegu and Shenmen were needled, to prevent an attack. After that, Jianyu, Quchi, Dazhui, Neiguan, Baihui, Xinshu, Dachangshu, Gaohuangshu and other acupoints were needled every other day. This was repeated 22 times, for a total of 44 days. Until now, the epilepsy has not occurred.

These examples show that acupuncture can indeed cure many chronic and stubborn diseases, and there are very few risks. In these years, alcohol was used to disinfect the needles and skin, and no suppuration or other disadvantages have been caused (Chinese medicine often causes suppuration without disinfection). The technique is not complicated, and learning is not difficult. Generally, as long as you are familiar with dozens of commonly used acupoints, the effect is generally quite certain. For example, when you encounter a patient with stomach problems, if you apply Zusanli and Zhongwan, an unexpected effect will occur immediately. When you encounter a toothache, needling Jiache and Hegu immediately relieves the pain, which is more effective than morphine. For patients with neurasthenia and insomnia, needling Yinlingquan and Neiguan will make them sleep more peacefully and comfortably than taking sleeping pills and tranquilizers. Therefore, this treatment method will definitely play a big role in solving the shortage of medicines and doctors in our country in the future. Now, a brief introduction is given, hoping to attract the attention and research of comrades engaged in medical work and all sectors of society, to seek further improvement together.

### 针灸可治沉疴痼疾　哈里逊医院试用效果良好

　　针灸可治沉疴痼疾
  　哈里逊医院试用效果良好
    自一九四六年，朱琏同志任晋冀鲁豫边区卫生局局长及哈里逊医院院长时，因见到药品、器材的缺乏，许多疾病拖延很久，不能治愈，根据她以前在延安试用针灸的经验，就提倡使用针灸治疗方法。到现在卫生局合并到华北政府卫生部时，推行针灸将近三年了。在初提倡时，我们医务人员思想上抵抗是很大的，有的人摇头说：“这个根本不合于科学”。有的人理也不理，用冷淡来表示他的轻蔑。朱局长就一面进行说服，一面就在哈里逊医院亲自施用，用实际的例子来教育大家。
    这种治疗方法，不但是节省药品材料，对许多顽固的疾病特别有效，而且群众对它也很熟习，愿意接受这种治疗，没有象“打洋药针”那种恐惧情绪。现在华北政府卫生局、哈里逊医院所有的医生、护士都学会了这种治疗方法，有些同志自己有了病，也要求使用这种方法来治疗了。这说明同志们已经体验到了针灸的良好效果。
    仅拿最近三个月针灸治疗的统计，就可说明针灸的效用是很好的。这期间，针灸疗病的人数为二百八十四名，总诊数为一千五百零六次，已经完全治愈的一百六十二名，占门诊各科总治愈数的三分之一。除去针灸以后病势减轻、半愈的不算，只拿这一百六十二名全愈了的来说，他们没有花一文钱的药品。如果用药品的话，每名以冀钞一万元计，一百六十二名便是一百六十二万元。
    现在再介绍几个临床的实际例子：
    一、患者张金花，女，二十五岁，杨西冶村人。主诉（病人自己说的主要症候）：胄部不适，全身发麻。症状：病将发作时，先觉全身发麻，随即感觉肢部有球状物鼓起，四肢痉摩，气短，心悸，两眼呆视，意识溷浊，诊断为歇斯忒里（失心疯）。治疗：从六月四号开始针治，第一次针心俞，合谷（这都是穴名），病人无感觉。第二次针内关、神门、大椎。七号发作一次。第三次针肩＠、曲池、合谷，觉轻松。第四次针中脘、足三里，觉食欲增加，精神较舒适。第五次针内关、心俞，肩＠，心悸与呼吸短促减轻。第六次针曲池、足三里，四肢发麻减轻。以后每隔一天后复针心俞、神门、合谷、曲池、足三里等穴，共针二十一次，以上各症均逐日减轻到消失，歇斯忒里遂停止发作。
    二、患者李春义，男，三十八岁，平山王木村人。主诉：腰腿部疼痛，运动障碍，症状：两年前患伤寒后而得此病，腰腿经常作痛，运动已发生障碍，腰部已呈强直，下肢关节伸屈亦不自如，每遇阴雨，疼痛加剧。诊断：腰腿偻麻质斯。（风湿症）治疗：七月二十四号开始针治，第一次针大胁俞、上胶，无感觉。第二次针次胶、环跳、委中，自觉迈步轻快，但运动仍有障碍。第三次针阿是、环跳，腰腿部更觉轻松，疼痛大为减轻，但弯腰仍受障碍。第四次针阿是、下胶，腰部已能运动，亦能够慢慢变屈，疼痛已甚轻微，以后复继续针阿是、下胶、伏急、环跳、上胶、足三里等，腰部已能弯屈运动，疼痛症状已不存在。先后共针十次，完全治愈。
    三、患者苏来书，女，十岁，平山冶庄村人。主诉：每隔十天至半月全身痉挛发作一次。其父有羊痫疯素因。症状：每隔半月到十天左右就要发作一次，发作时突然倒地，牙关紧闭，四肢与头强直，吐泡沫，舌常被咬破而流血、知觉全失，至醒后甚显倦怠。治疗：从八月五号开始针治。第一次针大椎。合谷。八号晚发作一次。第二次针合谷、神门，去发作。以后每隔一天针肩＠、曲池、大椎、内关、百会、心俞、大＠、膏盲俞等穴，如此反复针二十二次，共四十四天，直到现在癫痫一直没有发作。
    以上这几个例子，说明针灸确能治愈许多沉疴痼疾，并且极少危险。在这几年中，针与皮肤使用酒精消毒，就没有引起过化脓或别的弊害（中医不消毒，是常有化脓的）。技术又不复杂，学习也不困难，一般的只要熟习几十个常用的穴位，效果一般的都相当确实，比如遇到胄病病人，你给他扎足三里和中脘马上会发生以外的效果。遇到牙痛的，针颊本和合谷，马上止痛，比吗啡还有效。神经衰弱、失眠的病人、针湾陵泉、内关，就比服安眠、镇静药睡得更安稳舒服，所以这种治疗方法，在解决我国药品与医生的缺乏上，将来一定起到很大的作用。现在简略的介绍出来，希望引起从事医务工作的同志和社会各界的注意与研究，共谋更加改进。
