A Letter to Sisters in Hong Kong and Kowloon
Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Association Zhou Ying

My dear sisters in Hong Kong and Kowloon:

　　I have arrived in the liberated area, in a new world. This is a country created by the people with their own strength, their own blood and sweat, and their own lives. The people have become the masters of this country. It is our new China.

　　When we thought of or mentioned the liberated areas in the past, we always associated them with deep mountains and earthen kilns. However, today what I see with my own eyes is a liberated area that is already a fairly large-scale country. It has cities of all sizes and vast rural areas, occupying more than a quarter of the country's land and a population of 200 million; it has a government established by the people and good social order. Here, you cannot see corrupt officials, local bullies, or the invading forces of American imperialism, nor are there chaotic, desolate, or miserable scenes. It is a completely different world from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, a world of light and darkness in contrast.

　　In the many rural areas in the rear of the liberated areas that I passed through, I was amazed by the following things: First, the common people were working with clothes that had all their buttons and with lively and cheerful attitudes. If I hadn't seen all their activities supporting the front lines, I would hardly have thought that they were living in a time of war. The lives of the common people are not what they used to be. They have changed out of the clothes of "three years new, three years old, patching and mending for another three years," and no longer fill their stomachs with coarse chaff, bark, and wild grass. Everyone can eat their fill, dress warmly, and escape poverty and hunger. Second, the great power of the people. For a long time, under economically backward conditions, relying on millet, donkeys, and heavy ox-drawn carts to support such a large-scale modern war, they have defeated American imperialism's tanks, artillery, and airplanes, and are annihilating the main force of the reactionary ringleader Chiang Kai-shek's army, and eliminating the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. This is not only a miracle in Chinese history, but also a world-shaking great feat in world history. Here, production and support for the front lines are the two most important things. Everyone divides the work and cooperates, the front lines and the rear are united, and the waves of brilliant victories on the front lines and the production and labor competition to support the front lines in the rear are intertwined. The land is not divided into front and rear, and people are not divided into soldiers and civilians. All have become heroic and invincible fighters and heroes in the people's liberation war. With such a great people's power and strong and correct leadership, victory will inevitably belong to the people. Third, the relationship between the people and the army: In general, the common people used to fear the army and the soldiers, because they were anti-people armies. But now it is different. The first time I met the People's Liberation Army was on the way to the liberated area. There were two armed comrades in the same car with me. When my eyes met them, I immediately and unconsciously became nervous. But the common people in the car were calm and composed and politely gave up their seats to them. This was indeed something I had never experienced in my life. There are too many moving facts about the people loving the soldiers and the soldiers loving the people. The relationship between the common people and the soldiers has undergone a fundamental change here. The army is the people's army, and the soldiers are the people's soldiers. It is not the people themselves who fear the army and the soldiers, but the enemies of the people. Fourth, the working spirit of party and government cadres who faithfully serve the people: The people not only have an army like iron and steel, but also cadres like iron and steel. These cadres shoulder arduous work, forget their own fatigue, forget their own cold and heat, hunger and satiety, and run from east village to west village all day long, wholeheartedly helping the common people. Their spirit of practical work, hard work, and diligent study is not just a verbal slogan but a real manifestation in their actions. But their enjoyment of life is the same as that of the common people, and even some are not as good. Fifth: The supplies here are not lacking, which is really beyond our expectations. The people rely on their own labor and production to solve all their living needs. It is not easy to find American goods or imported goods here. The liberated areas not only have many products from modern factories, but also the sideline businesses and handicrafts of the common people are very developed. Many villages have established production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives. In areas where the textile industry is developed, each household has at least one spinning wheel or weaving machine. The amount of production and purchasing power are increasing day by day. There are markets everywhere. Whenever it is market day, the buying and selling common people are crowded and very lively. The people have used their own strength to prosper their cities and villages, and they can enjoy this prosperity themselves. Some common people who have never been to the city in their lives can now wear new clothes and go to the city to sightsee.

　　The situation of women is even more greatly different. Women who have always been despised and oppressed have come to the fore here, turned over, and gained true liberation. Things that have bound and abused women for thousands of years and the concept of favoring men over women are being eradicated from the root. The status of women in politics, economy, society, and family is undergoing fundamental changes. Each of them has a share of land and property, and they all actively participate in production, changing from a subordinate and enslaved position to the masters of the family and the country. They have not only played an active role in labor production, but also made brilliant contributions to the people's liberation war. In some areas, when the able-bodied men in the village went to the front lines, all the work was undertaken by women. The clothes and shoes worn by millions of soldiers were all spun yarn and woven cloth by women, and sewn by their hands stitch by stitch. They have also made many contributions in other tasks such as rice milling and caring for wounded soldiers. Because of their active labor production and enthusiastic support for the front lines, women have gained the respect of their families and society, and consolidated all the equal rights and status they have gained. Many women have been elected as people's representatives and participated in social and political activities. It is very common for women to be elected as district heads, village heads, and deputy village heads, and to assume important responsibilities. The liberation of rural women in the liberated areas has opened up a broad road for the development of the entire women's liberation movement.

　　The preparatory committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas calls on the sisters of women across the country to convene a national women's congress in the spring of 1949 to establish a national democratic women's federation. I believe you will all be very happy and agree with this proposal. This is something we have long hoped to achieve, especially today when we feel the urgent need for it. The whole country is about to be liberated, and we must never allow the invading forces of American imperialism and reactionary feudal forces to rule any corner of our country again. This situation requires us to further develop our combat strength and unite more closely, so that we can make greater efforts under unified guidance to strive for the rapid liberation of the people and women of the whole country. The sisters in Hong Kong and Kowloon are closely connected with the sisters in the motherland. All the sisters have always been enthusiastic and worked hard for the women's liberation movement and the democratic movement of the motherland, sparing no effort. They must have many valuable opinions to put forward for the epoch-making and unprecedented national women's congress that is about to be held, so that the congress can more fully complete its tasks.

　　After the entire liberation of Northeast China, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Tianjin were successively liberated, and Peiping will be taken in the near future. Some people describe Fu Zuoyi in Peiping as a rat trapped in a worthless clay pot. But how can it be just one Fu Zuoyi? Which of the war criminals has not already been trapped in a clay pot?

　　A friend said: "Compassion and pity for the enemy is cruel abuse of the people, and will commit an unforgivable mistake in history." This is very correct. Only by punishing war criminals, eliminating feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and expelling the invading forces of American imperialism can the Chinese people achieve complete liberation and obtain true peace. The eight peace foundations declared by Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China are in line with the will of the people. Only peace established on these eight conditions is the true peace that the people need. North China is about to be completely liberated, and the liberation of the people of the whole country is not far away. On the eve of the complete victory of the people, the outstanding sons and daughters of China, whether in the South or the North, overseas or at home, must be more vigilant, more united, and work harder to jointly strive to the end for the establishment of a truly independent, free, democratic, and peaceful New China.

### 寄港九姊妹们的一封信

　　寄港九姊妹们的一封信
    香港九龙妇女联谊会主席  周颖我所怀念的港九姊妹们：
    我已经到了解放区，到了一个新的世界。这是人民以自己的力量，以自己的血汗，以自己的生命创造出来的国家，人民成了这国家的主人。它就是我们的新中国。
    当我们过去想到或是提到解放区，首先总是联想到深山与土窑，可是，今天我亲眼看到的解放区，已经是颇具规模的国家了。它有着大小的城市与广大的乡村，占有全国四分之一以上的土地，二万万的人口；有着人民建立的政府与良好的社会秩序。这里看不见贪官污吏、土豪劣绅以及美帝国主义的侵略势力，也没有混乱萧条凄凉的景象，与国民党统治区是完全截然不同的、光明与黑暗对照的两个世界。
    在我经过解放区的许多后方乡村中，使我感到惊异的有这样几件事：第一，老百姓们穿着一个扣子都不少的衣服，带着活泼愉快的态度劳动着，如果不是看见他们支援前线的一切活动，几乎不会想到他们生活在战争年代里，老百姓的生活已经今非昔比。他们换掉了“新三年，旧三年，补补缝缝又三年”的衣服，不再用粗糠、树皮、野草装进自己的肚子，大家能够吃得饱，穿得暖，脱离了贫困与饥寒。第二，伟大的人民力量。长时期在经济落后的条件下，靠小米，毛驴，以及笨重的牛马大车来支援那么大规模的现代化的战争，却战胜了美帝国主义的坦克，大炮，飞机，消灭着反动头子蒋介石军队的主力，消灭着国民党的反动统治。这不仅是在中国历史上是奇迹，即在世界史上也是惊天动地的伟大壮举。在这里，生产与支援前线是最重要的两件事，大家分工合作，前线与后方团结一致，前线节节光辉的胜利与后方生产劳动竞赛支援前线的浪潮是互相交织着。地不分前线与后方，人不分军队与百姓，都成为人民解放战争的英勇无敌的斗士与英雄，有着这样伟大的人民力量以及坚强正确的领导，胜利是必然属于人民的。第三，人民与军队的关系：一般老百姓过去怕军队怕大兵，因为那是反人民的军队。但是现在不同了。我初次遇到人民解放军是在踏进解放区的途中，同车上有两位武装同志，当我的眼睛接触他们的时候，立即不自觉的紧张起来了。但车上的老百姓却安然自若地与他们在谦和的互让座位，这确实是我有生以来没有经历的事。人民爱士兵，士兵爱人民的可歌可泣的事实太多了。老百姓与士兵的关系，在这里是有了根本的改变。军队是人民的军队，士兵是人民的士兵。怕军队怕士兵不是人民自己，而是人民的敌人。第四，党政干部忠实为人民服务的工作精神：人民不仅有似铁似钢的军队，并且还有似铁似钢的干部，这些干部担负着艰苦的工作，忘记了自己的疲劳，忘记了自己的冷和热，饥和饱，成天由东村跑到西村，全心全意为了帮助老百姓奔忙。他们的实干苦干与勤勉学习的精神，不是单凭口头的呼喊而是真实的表现于他们的行动的。但他们的生活享受却和老百姓一样，甚至有些还不如。第五：这里的物资并不缺乏，实非我们所料。人民靠自己的劳动生产，解决了一切的生活需要。这里不容易找到美国货舶来品。解放区不仅有很多当时工厂的出品，老百姓的副业与手工业也非常发达，许多乡村已成立生产合作社、供销合作社，在纺织业发达的地方每家至少都有一架以上的纺纱车或织布机，生产量与购买力逐日并行的增加，到处都有集市，每到赶集的时候，买卖的老百姓们拥挤不堪，非常热闹。人民靠自己的力量繁荣了他们的城市和乡村，这繁荣也能由他们自己来享受。有些一辈子都不能进趟城的老百姓，在今天也能够穿着新的衣服进城去观光了。
    关于妇女的情况，更是大大地不同了。向来被轻视受压迫的妇女在这里是出了头翻了身，得到了真正的解放。几千年来束缚虐待妇女的东西与重男轻女的观念，正在从根拔除。妇女在政治、经济、社会上以及家庭中的地位，正在发生根本的改变。她们每人有了一份土地与财产，都积极的参加了生产，由附属奴役的地位而变为家庭与国家的主人，不仅只在劳动生产上起了积极的作用，对人民解放战争也有光辉的贡献。有些地区，村里的壮年上了前线，所有的事，都由妇女来承担。几百万战士所穿的衣服同鞋子，都是妇女纺的纱织的布，由她们的手一针一线的缝起来做出来的。他如在碾米，看护负伤战士等项工作中，她们都立了不少的功绩。妇女因为积极的劳动生产与热烈的支援前线，取得了家庭与社会的尊重，巩固了既得的一切平等的权利与地位。许多妇女被选为人民代表，参如了社会政治的活动。妇女被选为区长、村长、副村长，担当重要的责任是很平常的事。解放区农村妇女的解放，对整个妇女解放运动的发展，开辟了宽阔的道路。
    解放区妇女联合会筹备会，号召全国的妇女姊妹们在一九四九年春季召开全国妇女代表大会，成立全国民主妇女联合会。对于这个建议，我相信你们一定很高兴，很同意。这是我们久已期望实现的事，尤其在今天更感到迫切的需要。全国即将解放，我们绝不能使美帝国主义的侵略势力和反动封建势力，再统治我们国土上的任何角落。这个形势，需要把我们的战斗力量更大的发展，更亲密的团结，使我们能在统一的方针领导下，尽到更大的努力，来争取全国人民与全国妇女的迅速解放，港九的姊妹们与祖国的姊妹们是脉脉相通息息相关的，诸姊妹向来热心努力妇女解放运动与祖国民主运动，不遗余力，对于行将举行的划时代的空前的全国妇女代表大会，一定有很多宝贵的意见提出，使大会能更加圆满的完成它的任务。
    东北获得全部解放之后，郑州、开封、徐州、唐山、张家口、天津相继解放，北平已经指日可下。有人形容在北平的傅作义象一个装在不值钱的瓦罐子里的老鼠，其实岂止一个傅作义，所有的战争罪犯，那一个不是已经被装在瓦罐里的老鼠？
    有位朋友说：“对敌人的慈悲怜惜，即是对人民的残酷虐待，将在历史上犯不可饶恕的错误。”这是非常正确的话，只有惩办战争罪犯，消灭封建主义和官僚资本主义，驱逐美帝国主义的侵略势力，中国人民才能得到完全的解放，才能获有真正的和平。中共中央毛主席所宣示的八条和平基础，正是符合了人民的意志。只有在这八项条件之上所建立的和平，才是人民所需要的真正和平。华北即将全部解放，全国人民解放亦在不远。在人民完全胜利的前夕，中国优秀的儿女们，无论是在南方与北方，海外与国内，必须更加警惕，更加团结，更加努力，为建立真正的独立自由民主和平的新中国共同一致奋斗到底。
