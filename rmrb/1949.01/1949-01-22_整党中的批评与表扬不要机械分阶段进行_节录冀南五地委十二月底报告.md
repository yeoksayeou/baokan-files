Do Not Mechanically Divide the Criticism and Praise Phases in Party Rectification
Excerpt from the Jinnan Fifth Prefectural Committee's Report in Late December

　　Since the beginning of December, our sub-district's counties have been comprehensively carrying out party rectification and concluding the land reform work, based on the Prefectural Committee's resolution and the conditions of the cadres in each county. The preliminary party rectification in each county can be gradually concluded after the New Year. After the Prefectural Committee arranged to correct certain right-leaning deviations in the party rectification, the ideology has become more correct. Because the key village work has had a practical impact on party members and the masses, and the cadres have gained some initial experience, the work progress is also faster than before.

　　Regarding the issue of party rectification, the counties carried out key experiments, and the Prefectural Committee universally expanded the work based on the experimental results. Therefore, the party rectification began under relatively correct ideological guidance. However, because there is still a great lack of experience in party rectification, there is still a great deal of blindness in the methods. The counties, districts, and villages adopt different methods, which is certainly due to different circumstances, but many cannot explain the basis for using this method or that method. Most are stipulated by the leadership, or rigidly transplanting the experience of other places, or setting some subjective progress of their own, not knowing how to proceed from reality and from the immediate demands of the masses and party members, resulting in many detours.

　　The basic methods of party rectification are two: one is to praise first and then criticize; the other is to criticize first and then praise; there is also one that first examines the work, but in practice it also first reviews the merits of party members, so it basically belongs to the former method. A common feature of the two methods is that achievements and errors are reviewed in phases. Judging from the thinking of party members and the masses, generally, party member cadres with relatively large errors and a lot of work done are willing to talk about their merits first. They are willing to have the superiors and the masses understand their merits and forgive their mistakes. Party member cadres who have done good work, have few mistakes, or have no mistakes are willing to talk about their mistakes first, quickly exonerate themselves, and at the same time expose others. Ordinary party members and the masses who do not do much work and have no mistakes are unwilling to talk about their merits first, but it is not that they do not recognize that party members have merits. Their first requirement is to clarify the mistakes. Therefore, the two methods of praising first and then criticizing, or criticizing first and then praising, have produced two different ideological emotions among party members and the masses. Therefore, cadres have produced the above two propositions in leading party rectification methods. Comrades who advocate praising first and then criticizing believe that after party members talk about their merits, they will increase their courage and reduce many unnecessary resistances when reflecting on their mistakes. However, those who advocate this method cannot say what the masses think of this method. Those who advocate the second method believe that speaking of merits first will reduce the courage of most party members and the masses to criticize, feeling that others have merit, and it is useless to make suggestions. Those party members who have made mistakes carry a sense of pride when reflecting on their mistakes after talking about their merits, and their attitude is not very honest. Regardless of which method is adopted, there is still the problem of insufficient mobilization at present. According to today's incomplete and immature judgment, it is because the method of praising first and then criticizing is clearly separated, so although cadres pay attention to mobilizing the masses and go to do mobilization work, they still cannot fully mobilize.

　　These two methods are both executing the confused concept of praising first and then criticizing, and are both erroneously and mechanically reviewing the achievements and errors of a problem or a party member in stages (these days only talk about achievements, those days only talk about errors.) As a result of this separation of stages, whether it is this way or that way, the emotions of party members and the masses, or of those who have made mistakes and those who have not made mistakes, will fluctuate high and low, or this high and that low, and their thinking will be unstable.

　　In villages where the party rectification is better, most party members put down their burdens, good party members are praised, and feel that they have been exonerated and will no longer follow the muddled water; party members who have made mistakes feel that the superiors and the masses understand their merits, and their mistakes have also been confessed frankly, the superiors and the masses forgive them, and they also put down their burdens; party members with big mistakes and small merits are punished, although they are depressed, but the leadership has also put forward ways out for them, so they feel happy in the unpleasantness. Most of the middle and poor peasants among the masses feel that their words have been spoken, and the party members have admitted their mistakes, but they remember the merits of the party members, and feel that it is not easy to be a party member, so they forgive the minor mistakes of the party members. Those few people who wanted revenge were originally afraid that party members would retaliate and were always on guard, but there was no actual retaliation, and some party members' words and deeds improved after being criticized and punished. In this kind of village, the relationship between the party and the masses has greatly improved, most party members work actively, the vast majority of the masses are happy, the party's prestige is improved, and the masses ask to join the party. We have instructed all counties to warmly welcome the masses who want to join the party, but they must strictly follow the party constitution to carry out the procedures for joining the party.

　　In those villages where the work is not very good, the opinions of the masses and most party members have not been fully expressed, or the analysis and handling of the expressions are not good. Therefore, the basic program of party rectification has passed, and party member cadres have also admitted their mistakes to the masses, and even apologized, but their thinking has not been transformed, and the purpose of improving unity has not been achieved, and the atmosphere in the countryside remains the same. Therefore, the current problem is to enable the masses of party members to fully express their opinions, and to lead party members and the masses to analyze these opinions, affirm the correct ones, criticize the wrong ones, praise the good ones, criticize and punish the bad ones, and thereby improve the masses, improve party members, and achieve unity.

　　(Editor's note: The so-called praising first and then criticizing refers to first affirming the other party's achievements and advantages when criticizing, and then criticizing their errors and shortcomings, so that the other party accepts and promotes their conscious self-criticism, but it is not mechanically dividing stages, let alone forcing the masses to support the cadres.)

### 整党中的批评与表扬不要机械分阶段进行  节录冀南五地委十二月底报告

　　整党中的批评与表扬不要机械分阶段进行
    节录冀南五地委十二月底报告
    我分区自十二月初旬，各县即已根据地委决议、及各县干部的条件，全面开展整党及结束土改工作。各县初步整党新年后可逐次结束。地委布置纠正整党中某些右的偏向后，思想已较端正。由于重点村工作中曾给党员群众以实际的影响，干部也已取得了一些初步经验，因此工作进展亦较前为快。
    关于整党问题，各县经过重点实验，及地委根据实验结果普遍展开，因此整党开始就是在比较正确的思想指导下进行的。但是因为整党还是非常缺乏经验，因此作法上还存有很大的盲目性。各县、区、村采用不同的方法，固然是由于情况的不同，但许多都说不出用这种方法和那种方法的根据，而多是领导上规定了的，或系将旁处的经验死板的搬运，或系自己规定了一些主观的进度，不知道从实际出发，从群众党员当前迫切要求作起，以致走了很多弯路。
    整党方法基本是两种：一是先拥护后批评；一是先批评后拥护；还有一种是先检查工作，实际进行起来也是先检讨党员的功劳，因此基本上属于前一类作法。两种作法的共同特点是成绩与错误划分阶段检讨。根据党员和群众思想看，一般的是错误较大、工作作的也多的党员干部，愿意先说功劳。他们愿叫上级和群众了解他们的功劳，原谅他们的错误。工作好、错误小或没什么错误的党员干部，愿意先讲错误，赶快洗白自己，同时暴露别人。那些工作不多也没有什么错误的一般党员和群众，不愿先讲功劳，但他们不是不承认党员有功，他首先的要求是弄清错误。因此先拥护后批评，或先批评后拥护的两种作法，在党员群众中出现两种不同的思想情绪。因此干部在领导整党的方法上便产生以上两种主张。主张先拥护后批评的同志，认为党员讲了功劳以后，在反省自己错误的时候，就增加了勇气，减少了许多不必要的抵抗。但主张这种作法的人说不出群众对于这种作法的意见来。主张第二种作法的认为先讲功劳就会使多数党员和群众减低了批评的勇气，觉得人家有功，咱提意见也是白提。那些犯错误的党员在讲功劳之后在反省错误的时候带有骄傲情绪，态度上不大老实。不论采取何种作法，目前仍有发动不够的问题存在，按今天不完全成熟的判断，就是因为在方法上把先拥护后批评截然划开，因此干部虽注意发动群众，也去作发动工作，但仍不能充分发动。
    这两种作法都是执行先拥护后批评的糊涂观念，都是错误地机械地把一个问题的或一个党员的成绩和错误分段检讨（这几天光说成绩，那几天光说错误。）而这样分开阶段的结果，无论是先这样或先那样，都会使党员与群众、或犯错误的与不犯错误的两方面的情绪一高一低，或此高彼低，思想动荡不定。
    凡是整党较好的村庄，多数党员放下包袱，好党员受到表扬，觉得自己洗白出来，再不跟着淌混水；有错误的党员觉得上级群众了解自己的功劳，自己的错误也坦白出来，上级和群众原谅了自己，也放下了包袱；错误大的功劳小的党员受到处分虽然苦闷，但领导又给提出了出路，因此在不愉快中感到愉快。群众中之多数中贫农觉得自已的话说了出来，党员又承认了错误，反而又想起党员的功劳来，感到作一个党员不容易，因此对党员的较小错误原谅。那些想报复的少数人，本来怕党员反手报复处处招架，但实际并没有报复，而且有些党员受到批评处分后，言行态度都有好转，这种村庄当然党群关系有很大改善，大多数党员工作积极，绝大多数群众愉快，党的威信提高，群众要求入党。我们已指示各县对群众要求入党应热情欢迎，但又必须按照党章严格执行入党手续。
    那些作的不大好的村庄，群众和多数党员的意见没有充分发表出来，或发表出来分析与处理的不好，因此整党基本节目作过去了，党员干部也向群众承认了错误，甚至于赔了情道了歉，但思想上并没有改造，提高团结目的亦达不到，农村气象如故。因此目前的问题是使群众党员充分发表意见，并领导党员群众分析这些意见，肯定对的、批评错的，表扬好的，批评处分坏的，从此提高群众，提高党员，达到团结。
    （编者按：所谓先拥护后批评，是指在进行批评时，先肯定对方成绩优点，然后批评其错误缺点，使对方接受，促其自觉地进行自我批评，而并不是机械地划分阶段，更不是勉强群众去拥护干部。）
