　　What were the First and Second North China Incidents?
　　Editor:
　　We found two questions in our textbook while teaching: the First North China Incident and the Second North China Incident. There is no explanation on them. What exactly do these First and Second North China Incidents refer to?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhang Yingbi, WenShui Middle School, Jinzhong
　　Answer: In May of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), Chiang Kai-shek sent He Yingqin to secretly sign an agreement with the commander of the Japanese army in North China, Meijin: most of the sovereignty of Hebei and Chahar was given to the Japanese invaders - this is called the "He-Meijin Agreement" and is the First North China Incident.
　　Not many months later, the Japanese invaders instigated the traitor Yin Rugeng to establish the "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Government" in Tongxian. They also incited Song Zheyuan to unite the five provinces of North China to secede from the Nanjing government. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly withdrew the Peiping Military Committee and ordered the establishment of the "Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee" to implement a disguised autonomy in North China, lightly presenting North China. This is the Second North China Incident. It took place in October of the 24th year (1935).
　　For details, please refer to Lesson 17, "The North China Incident" in the second volume of elementary school history (reviewed and approved by the Education Department of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu).

　　第一次和第二次华北事变是怎么一回事？
    编辑同志：
    我们在讲课发现课本上有第一次华北事变与第二次华北事变两个问题，上面也没有解释，到底这第一次第二次华北事变都是指的那两件事情？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　晋中文水中学张英壁
    答：民国二十四年五月蒋介石派何应钦与华北日军司令梅津，秘密签订协定：把冀察主权，大部送给日寇——这叫“何梅协定”，是第一次华北事变。
    没有隔几个月，日寇又唆使汉奸殷汝耕，在通县成立“冀东防共自治政府”。策动宋哲元联合华北五省脱离南京政府。蒋介石又赶忙撤退北平军委会，下令设立“冀察政务委员会”实行华北变相的自治，轻轻把华北奉送了。这就是第二次华北事变。时在二十四年十月。
