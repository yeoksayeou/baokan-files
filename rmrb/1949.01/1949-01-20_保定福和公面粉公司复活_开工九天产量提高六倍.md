Jizhong Electric: Like a drowning person being rescued, the Baoding Fuhegong Flour Company has been brought back to life with the support of the People's Government. The Fuhegong Flour Company was founded in the fourth year of the Republic of China, starting with a small stone mill. Through the hard work of all employees over the years, by the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, they built buildings, installed machinery, and expanded into an electric flour company. The entire factory had forty-eight people and three machines, producing 450 bags of flour per day, which were sold in the city and throughout Hebei Province. In the twenty-sixth year, when the Japanese invaders entered the city, the factory suffered enormous property losses. After the victory against Japan, the bandit Fu imposed a military blockade. Due to a lack of raw materials and electricity, the factory had been operating sporadically since the spring, "fishing" for three days and "drying nets" for two days. Furthermore, heavy taxes made it impossible to make ends meet, resulting in selling off assets and reducing the workforce to twenty-one people. In July, Li Shilin, the commander of Fu’s New Second Army and garrison commander, demolished 180 rooms of warehouses, dormitories, business offices, and bungalows under the pretext of "obstructing shooting." Most of the bricks and tiles were taken away by Fu’s bandits to build pillboxes. Except for the machine room, everything else was turned into rubble. Manager Zhao left in anger for Tianjin, and the number of employees was reduced to only thirteen caretakers. Everyone sighed at the sight of the rusty machines, hoping that the People's Liberation Army would liberate Baoding soon. On November 22nd, the People's Liberation Army finally arrived. After the People's Government posted a notice protecting national industry and commerce, the company immediately sent people to bring back eight employees who had returned home due to the shutdown. Everyone elected the veteran employee Wang Jinchen as acting manager to prepare for the resumption of work. However, due to a shortage of wheat (raw materials), electricity and the lack of a dynamo, it was impossible to start work for a while. However, with the assistance of the People's Government, coal was transported, and the power plant quickly resumed supplying electricity. The electric company lent them a dynamo, and the People's Government allocated 100,000 catties of military wheat for processing. All employees were overjoyed, cleaning machines, sweeping rooms, and working non-stop. On the 15th, the machine was repaired and installed, and on the 16th, it started work immediately. Acting Manager Wang said, "Under the leadership of the People's Government, our business will surely prosper, and everyone will work hard to produce." Nine days after reopening, production increased from 30 bags of flour per day to 180 bags. (If electricity increases, two shifts day and night can increase production to 450 bags.) In addition to supplying citizens, it also processed 9,900 catties of military wheat, yielding 1,109 catties of flour. Now the morale of the employees has doubled. Because there are few houses, they work and sleep in the flour mill. In order to expand business, they are now designing drawings to build offices and dormitories next spring. After Tianjin is liberated, they plan to purchase two more sets of machines and increase the number of employees. Manager Zhao from the former company wrote from Tianjin saying: "I am delighted to hear that Baoding has been liberated and the company has resumed work. I will return to Baoding from Tianjin immediately."

　　保定福和公面粉公司复活
  　开工九天产量提高六倍
    【冀中电】象溺者得救一样，保定市福和公面粉公司，在人民政府的扶植下，死而复生。福和公面粉公司，创于民国四年，当时由小火磨起家。由于全体职工的多年辛勤劳作，到民国二十五年，修建楼房，装置机器，扩大成电力面粉公司。全厂四十八人，三架机器，每日出面粉四百五十袋，行销本市和河北各地。二十六年，日寇侵入本市，该厂财产损失巨大。抗日胜利后，傅匪实行军事封锁，该厂由于没原料，无电力，今春以来，三天“打鱼”，两天“晒网”，更加捐税重重，入不敷出，形成卖本吃本，解雇减员到廿一人。七月间，傅匪新二军军长兼警备司令李士林，以“妨碍射击”为词，拆卸货栈、宿舍、营业室等楼房及平房一百八十间，砖瓦被傅匪载去大部修了炮楼。除机器房以外，其余全都变成瓦砾。赵经理气走天津，职工由二十一人仅剩下十三人看厂。大家看到生锈的机器唉声叹气，盼望解放军早日解放保定。十一月二十二日，解放军终于来到了。人民政府贴出保护民族工商业的布告后，公司立即派人找回因停工回家的八个职工，大家公推老职工王尽臣暂代经理，筹备复工。但因缺麦（原料）、及无电缺电滚，一时无法开工。然在人民政府协助下，运来煤炭，发电厂也迅速恢复送电，并由电灯公司借来电滚，人民政府并拨发十万斤军麦代磨。全体职工欢喜若狂：擦机器，扫房间，忙个不停。十五号机器修装完竣，十六日即开始复工。王代经理说：“在人民政府领导下，我们生意一定兴隆，大家一定努力生产。”开工九天后，由日产三十袋面粉，增至一百八十袋。（如电力增加，日夜两班，能增产四百五十袋。）除供给市民外，并代磨军麦九千九百斤，收益一千一百零九斤面粉。现在职工情绪倍增。因为房子少，就在面房里办公、睡觉。为扩大营业，现正设计准备明春修造办公室、宿舍的图样。等津解放后，拟再置两套机器，增加员工。前该公司赵经理从天津来信说：“欣闻保定解放，公司复工，我即津返保。”
