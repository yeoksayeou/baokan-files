Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, Urgent Dispatch, 3:00 PM, 15th: The People's Liberation Army completely occupied Tianjin, the largest industrial and commercial city in North China, at 1:30 PM today. The entire defending enemy force was annihilated. Bandit Chief Chen Changjie, commander of the Tianjin Garrison, was captured alive. The citizens are extremely delighted with the swift liberation of Tianjin. The attack on Tianjin began at 10:00 AM on the 14th, and the battle was completely resolved in just 27 and a half hours. The swift liberation of Tianjin is a clear lesson to Fu Zuoyi and Li Wen in Beiping: If they do not accept the PLA's demand to surrender quickly with their troops, they will only be waiting to be taken prisoner.

Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, Urgent Dispatch, 2:00 PM, 14th: Our army began attacking Tianjin at 10:00 AM today. By 12:00 PM, it had entered the city and is now fiercely expanding its control.

Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 13th: Since General Lin Biao, commander of the People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front, and General Luo Ronghuan, political commissar, issued a broadcast demanding that the Kuomintang army in Pingjin lay down their arms automatically to avoid losses to the people of the two cities, the Tianjin Municipal Council sent four representatives to negotiate outside the city on the 10th. General Liu Yalou, commander of the People's Liberation Army Tianjin Front, met with them and immediately pointed out the following: (1) Tianjin is a major industrial city in North China, and the People's Liberation Army hopes for a peaceful resolution to avoid war damage. (2) All Kuomintang troops in Tianjin should automatically lay down their arms. The People's Liberation Army guarantees the safety of life and property of these troops and officers and allows them to leave or stay as they please. (3) The People's Liberation Army will cease fire for 24 hours, waiting for the reply from the Tianjin garrison. (4) If the Tianjin garrison is unwilling to lay down their arms automatically, the People's Liberation Army will launch an offensive. The leaders of the Tianjin garrison should bear the responsibility for causing war damage to Tianjin and will be severely punished, and cannot be treated the same as defeated and captured officers in small cities or villages. After the representatives returned, the People's Liberation Army implemented a 24-hour ceasefire. However, as of the time of this dispatch, the Tianjin garrison has not indicated that they will lay down their arms automatically. If the enemy makes no further indication, the People's Liberation Army will launch a general attack on the 14th.

　　我军完全解放天津
  　全歼守敌活捉匪首陈长捷
    【新华社平津前线十五日下午三时急电】人民解放军今日下午一时半完全占领华北最大的工商业城市天津，守敌全部被歼。匪首天津警备司令陈长捷被生俘。市民对于天津的迅速解放，极为欢欣。对天津的攻击开始于十四日上午十时，仅历二十七个半小时即完全解决战斗。天津的迅速解放，给北平的傅作义和李文一个鲜明的教训：如不接受解放军的要求迅速率部投降，他们就只有等着做俘虏。
    【新华社平津前线十四日十五点急电】我军于本日十时开始攻击天津，至十二时，已攻入市内，现正猛烈扩张中。
    【新华社平津前线十三日电】自人民解放军平津前线司令员林彪将军、政治委员罗荣桓将军发出要求平津国民党军自动放下武器，以免两城人民遭受损失的广播之后，天津市参议会派出了四名代表，于十日出城谈判。人民解放军天津前线司令员刘亚楼将军接见了他们，当即向他们指出如下各点：（一）天津为华北主要工业城市，人民解放军甚望和平解决，藉免遭受战争破坏。（二）一切天津国民党军队应自动放下武器，人民解放军保证这些军队官兵生命财产的安全及去留自便。（三）人民解放军停战二十四小时，等候天津守军的答复。（四）如果天津守军不愿自动放下武器，则人民解放军将发动进攻，天津守军的首领们应当担负使天津遭受战争破坏的责任，而受到严厉的惩罚，不能照小城市或乡村中战败被俘的军官同等看待。代表们回去后，人民解放军实行停战二十四小时。但是天津守军方面直至发电时止，并无自动放下武器的表示。如果敌方再无表示，人民解放军即将于十四日举行总攻击。
