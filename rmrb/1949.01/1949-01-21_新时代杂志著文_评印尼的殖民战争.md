　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The latest issue of "New Era" magazine published an article by Polizkov entitled "The Colonial War in Indonesia," stating: Even though on December 24th, the majority of the U.S. and the U.K. passed a resolution in the Security Council demanding a ceasefire by "both sides," the resolution did not propose a clear date for the ceasefire, nor did it stipulate that Dutch troops immediately withdraw to the positions they held before the resumption of hostilities. This resolution only encouraged the aggressors. Recent events have fully exposed that the ruling groups in Washington and London are accomplices in the heinous war in Indonesia. U.S. and British imperialists continue to provide their Dutch allies with all possible military, economic, and political assistance. Dutch troops are using U.S.-made "Sherman" tanks, "Mustang" aircraft, and B-25 bombers to deal with the Republic of Indonesia. Washington not only supplies the Dutch aggressors with weapons, ammunition, and other equipment, but also provides the Dutch troops with food. The Netherlands has received $140 million worth of war materials from the United States. The United States also supports The Hague diplomatically. The infamous "mediation" of the "mediation" committee only benefits the Dutch authorities. Wall Street has not ignored its own interests either. Those who proposed the "mediation" committee are trying to extend the expansion of U.S. monopoly capital into Indonesia. The U.S. representative on the "mediation" committee has the final vote. The committee has done everything possible to help the Dutch imperialists divide the Republic; surround the Republic with many puppet states; force it to make many concessions that help the invading army occupy the entire Indonesia; and once again reduce it to a colonial status. The U.S. representative has put pressure on the Republic of Indonesia, forcing it to make new economic and political concessions. Democratic reforms have been deprived, and the Hatta government has canceled important measures such as land reform. Last September, the Hatta government agreed to use the Republic's national resources as collateral for U.S. loans. The surrender policy pursued by Hatta and his ilk has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the people. Progressive forces have united (including the Indonesian Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Labor Party), ensuring unity in the struggle for the true independence of Indonesia. Many reports from Indonesia talk about the victorious operations of the Republic's guerrillas. The Indonesian people's struggle for independence will not be defeated.

  　评印尼的殖民战争
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期的“新时代”杂志发表波利兹柯夫题为“印尼的殖民战争”的专文称：纵然十二月二十四日美英多数在安理会通过了决议，要求“双方”停战，但决议没有提出停战的明确日期，也没有规定荷军立即撤退至重启战端以前的阵地。该决议只是鼓励了侵略者。最近的事件完全暴露出华盛顿与伦敦的统治集团是对印尼的罪恶战争的同谋人。美英帝国主义者继续尽可能的予其荷兰同盟者以军事上、经济上及政治上的一切援助。荷军正使用美造“薛尔曼”式坦克、“穆斯东”飞机与Ｂ—２５式轰炸机来对付印尼共和国。华盛顿不仅供给荷兰侵略者以武器、军火及其他装备，而且供应荷军以粮食。荷兰自美国得到价值一亿四千万美元的战争物资。美国并在外交上支持海牙。声名狼籍的“调处”委员会的“调处”，仅只有利于荷兰当局。华尔街也没有忽视它自己的利益。那些提议“调处”委员会的人们，力图将美国垄断资本的扩张伸入到印尼。“调处”委员会中美方代表有最后表决权。委员会曾尽一切努力帮助荷帝国主义者分裂共和国；以许多傀儡邦来包围共和国；迫使它作出许多有助于进犯军占领整个印尼的让步，并再次使它降到殖民地的地位。美代表曾对印尼共和国施以压力，迫使它作新的经济上与政治上的让步。民主改革已被剥夺，哈达政府已取消了象土地改革那样重要的措施。去年九月，哈达政府同意以共和国的国家资源作为美国贷款的抵押品。哈达及其同伙所从事的投降政策，在人民中间引起了广泛的不满。进步力量已团结起来（其中包括印尼共产党、社会党与劳工党），保证一致为争取印尼的真正独立而斗争。来自印尼的许多报导皆谈到共和国游击队的胜利作战。印尼人民的独立斗争是不会被击败的。
