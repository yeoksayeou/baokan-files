　　Jilu Yu Cracks Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Case
　　North China People's Government Issues Commendation
　　[本报讯] The North China People's Government issued a commendation on December 31st to the Jilu Yu Administrative Office Public Security Department for cracking the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "21st Station" special agent case. It stated in brief: The Jilu Yu Administrative Office Public Security Department, during our army's liberation of Jinan, arrested more than 20 Chiang Kai-shek armed special agents including He Yuzhen and Zou Jianzhong. This action directly supported the victory of the front-line war and consolidated the rear of the war. He, Zou, and others had been secretly operating in the Dongqilitun, Shuangmiao, and Zhengguantun areas of Liaocheng in our territory since March 1947, using the name "Hua Ye 21st Station" to carry out semi-public sabotage activities for as long as a year. They also colluded with local ruffians Bu Xiangbin, Xiao Guoxing, Yang Ruizhi, Xiao Jinyu, and others, appearing as merchants and operating in the Jinan, Huimin, and Linqing areas. In April, the Jilu Yu Public Security Department received a confidential report that He, Zou, and other bandits were responsible for the fourth group of Chiang Kai-shek's Sui District intelligence. After several months of secret investigation, the information was confirmed beyond doubt. Just as Jinan was being liberated, these bandits also felt fear and plotted to flee to Xuzhou. Due to the Public Security Department's careful prior arrangements and ambushes along the way, the bandit special agents He Yuzhen, Zou Jianzhong, Yang Ruizhi, Xiao Guoxing, and their families, more than 20 people in total, were all captured in one fell swoop. This active and responsible attitude towards the people's cause, and the high degree of revolutionary vigilance, is worthy of emulation by public security departments in all regions and government cadres at all levels. A special commendation is hereby issued.

　　冀鲁豫破获蒋特案
  　华北人民政府通令表扬
    【本报讯】华北人民政府十二月三十一日通令表扬冀鲁豫行署公安处破获蒋匪伪“廿一兵站”特务案。略称：冀鲁豫行署公安处，于我军解放济南之际，逮捕了蒋匪武装特务何玉珍、邹建中等廿余人，这一行动，直接配合了前线战争的胜利，巩固了战争的后方。何邹等人于一九四七年三月间，即潜伏我内地聊城东七里屯、双庙、郑官屯地区，冒充“华野廿一兵站”名义，进行半公开的破坏活动，竟达一年之久，并结合当地流氓，卜祥彬、肖国兴、杨瑞芝、萧金玉等，以商人面目出现，活动于济南、惠民、临清一带。四月间，我冀鲁豫公安处得密报，知何邹等匪乃蒋匪绥区谍报四组负责人，经过数月来之密侦结果，确实无疑。正当济南解放之际，该匪等亦感恐惧、图谋逃往徐州。由于公安处事先布置周密，中途设伏，遂将该匪特何玉珍、邹建中、杨瑞芝、萧国兴及其眷属二十余人，一网打尽。这种对人民事业积极负责态度，及革命的高度警惕性，值得各地区公安部门及各级政府工作干部学习，兹特通令表扬。
