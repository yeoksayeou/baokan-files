"Learning Discussion" Needs a Conclusion

Comrades of the People's Daily Editorial Department:

　　The newly added "Learning Discussion" column is very good (especially after the North China Bureau decided to strengthen on-the-job cadre education), and it is of great help to our learning. The questions raised draw our attention and inspire us to think about the issues. But at the same time, I have this feeling: after a question is raised, readers see it, and there are often points of divergence and opposition in opinions. In the end, who is right and who is wrong? After a debate, it is still impossible to distinguish. In order to help comrades effectively solve problems, I suggest to your newspaper:

　　After each learning question (related to principles and policies) is discussed, please have the North China Central Bureau make a conclusion. This is of great benefit to cadres in improving their political and theoretical level, their way of thinking, and improving work efficiency.

　　Is this opinion correct? Please reply in the newspaper.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Liu Yi

### “学习讨论”要作结论

专栏：

　　“学习讨论”要作结论
    人民日报编辑同志：
    近来增辟的“学习讨论”栏很好（尤其是在华北局决定加强在职干部教育之后），它对我们的学习帮助很大。这些问题的提出引起我们的注意，启发我们对问题的思索。但我同时有这样一个感觉：即一个问题提出后，读者看了，意见常有分歧和抵触之点，究竟谁对谁非，争论一场，仍然无法辨别。为了帮助同志切实解决问题起见，我向贵报建议：
    每一个学习问题（有关原则和政策的）讨论之后，请华北中央局作一结论。这对于干部提高政治理论水平与思想方法。及提高工作效率是有很大好处的。
    此种意见对否？敬请于报端答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　刘毅
