[Jizhong News] After a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was stationed in Baoding City, it was warmly supported by the people of the whole city because it strictly observed the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army. Before entering the city, the unit conducted in-depth education on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, carried out general self-criticism, and formulated plans. After entering Baoding, even though the windows of the houses they lived in were shattered, the comrades preferred to be cold rather than arbitrarily look for other houses; when eating, if there were no bowls, everyone used handkerchiefs, vegetable leaves, and paper to hold their food. The children in the nursery saw that they had no bowls and lent them their own, but the soldiers politely declined with a smile. Soldier Suo Shukai of the Tenth Squad dug up five rounds of 38 rifle bullets while digging fortifications. He liked them and wanted to exchange them, but he thought, "This is discipline." He immediately handed them over to the company headquarters. An old woman, the landlady of the Eighth Squad of the First Company, saw that the comrades had few quilts and brought out her own quilt for the soldiers to use, but it was eventually declined. Chen Fang of the First Company picked up a small bag while on guard duty. It was full of money. He discovered that the owner—an old man—hadn't gone far, so he quickly called him to stop and handed him the bag. The old man gratefully said, "I've lived for so long, and I've never seen such a good army!" When soldier Ma Xiaoshui's father from the Tenth Squad came to see him, Ma Xiaoshui thought that it was during martial law and advised his father not to come in for the time being. His father said, "Are you still not clear about your dad?" Ma Xiaoshui said, "This is the order from above. You can come in to see me when it's 'open'!" Cao Zhiheng, a communicator from the Eleventh Squad, broke a small basin belonging to the landlord. He took 5,000 yuan of border currency to compensate the landlord. The landlord didn't want it, saying, "You drove them (Liu bandit Huanan) away, and that's all your credit. What does breaking this basin matter?" Cao Zhiheng said, "Compensating for damages is the discipline of our People's Liberation Army!" The landlord refused again and again, so he threw the money on the kang (platform bed).
    The kitchen broke three bowls belonging to the landlord and wanted to compensate the landlord 15,000 yuan. The landlord didn't want it no matter what. After arguing for a long time, they couldn't win, and had to say, "Even if you compensate, they're not worth that much. You can buy one for three thousand yuan." The kitchen finally compensated at 3,500 yuan per bowl. Chen Fang saw an old lady carrying water. He rushed over to carry it for her to her house and then carried a shoulder pole full. The old lady said, "You not only don't drink our water, but you also carry water for us. You're truly the people's relatives!" Because of their strict discipline, all the citizens of Baoding praised them highly, calling them the "Benevolent and Righteous Army." The impact of their actual actions quickly made the citizens of the entire city understand the various policies of the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the democratic government. However, because they are not familiar with urban life, some individual comrades cannot find toilets and defecate and urinate indiscriminately. This needs to be overcome through education in the future.

　　进驻保定我军
  　纪律严明全市赞扬
    【冀中讯】人民解放军某部进驻保定市后，因为严格地遵守了人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意，获得全城人民热烈拥护。进城前，该部就深入进行了三大纪律、八项注意的教育，并普遍进行了检讨，订出计划。进入保定以后，住的屋子窗户都震破了，同志们宁肯冷着也不随便另找房子；吃饭时没有碗，大家便用手巾、菜帮和纸托着吃。育婴堂的小孩见他们没碗，把自己的碗借给他们，也被战士们笑着谢绝了。十中队战士索树凯，挖工事挖出了五粒三八子弹，他心里喜爱，想换了，但想到：“这是纪律”。便马上交到连部。一中队八班房东老太太见同志们被子少，抱出自己的被子让战士们铺，也终于被谢绝了。一中队陈芳站岗拾了一个小口袋，里头装的是票子，他发现失主——一个老大伯走的不远，便连忙喊住，把口袋交给他，那老大伯感激的说：“我活了这么大年纪，那见过这样好的军队呀！”十中队战士马小水他父亲来看他，马小水想到正在戒严时间，劝爹暂时不要进来；他爹说：“你还闹不清你爹吗？”马小水说：“这是上级的命令，等‘开放’了你再进来看我吧！”十一中队通信员曹志恒摔了房东一个小盆，拿着五千元边币去赔，房东不要，说：“你们把他们（刘匪化南）打跑了，这都是你们的功劳。打这盆算什么？”曹志恒说：“损物赔偿，是我们人民解放军的纪律！”房东再三不要，他便把钱扔在炕上。
    伙房没了房东三个碗，要赔房东一万五千元；房东说什么也不要，打呱了半天，争不过，只得说：“要赔，也不值这些钱，三千块钱就可以买一个。”伙房最后按三千五百块钱一个碗赔了。陈芳见一个老大娘提水，他抢过去替他提着提到家，又担了一挑子，老大娘说：“你们不光不吃俺们的水，还给俺们挑水，真算是老百姓的亲人！”因为纪律严明，全保定市市民对他们都非常赞扬，称他们为“仁义之师”。他们的实际行动的影响，全市市民很快的便认识了共产党、人民解放军和民主政府的各种政策。但是因为对城市生活不熟悉，还有个别同志找不到厕所，随便大小便，这是需要今后教育克服的。
