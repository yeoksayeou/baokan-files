　　Oppose the United States' Release of Japanese Aggressor War Criminals
    MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the United States' administration of Japan, arbitrarily released nineteen important Japanese war criminals on the 24th, and publicly announced that the trials of major war criminals within Japan "have ended" and that "no more trials will be initiated in the future." Among this group of privately released war criminals are many executioners who directly slaughtered the Chinese people and culprits who invaded China, such as former Commander of the Japanese Army in China, Shiro Nishio, former head of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Special Service Agency, Yoshio Kodama, and former ambassador to the Wang Jingwei puppet government in Nanjing, Tanimasa.
    This reactionary act of the United States government is the inevitable result of its consistent reactionary policy. The American imperialists have long disregarded the just opinions of the Soviet Union and other Allied peoples, and have stubbornly regarded Japanese war criminals as their own. They have always adopted a policy of shielding and harboring Japanese war criminals. After the Far East International Military Tribunal announced the verdicts for the twenty-five major Japanese war criminals, we pointed out that the Chinese people were satisfied with the death sentences for Tojo and the other seven war criminals, but expressed dissatisfaction and indignation at the lenient sentences for other major war criminals. The American reactionaries even tried their best to overturn and undermine such a verdict, which was not entirely satisfactory. Only under the opposition of world justice and public opinion were the American reactionaries forced to execute Tojo and the other seven war criminals, reluctantly doing what MacArthur called "something that he was unwilling to do but had to do." Given that the outcome of this trial could not be completely directed as the United States wished, the American reactionaries are now simply announcing the release and cancellation of trials for other important Japanese war criminals!
    The progressive people of the world cannot but express anger at this despicable and criminal act of the American reactionaries, and the Chinese people in particular must resolutely oppose it. Because this is an infringement on the dignity of all nations that have been harmed by Japanese fascism, and especially an insult to the Chinese people who suffered the earliest and most severe harm from Japanese fascism. The blood of millions of victims in China during the Anti-Japanese War cannot be shed in vain, and the grievances of millions of widows, widowers, orphans, and childless people must be redressed. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot but express their solemn protest against this. The Chinese people believe that any unreasonable decisions and judgments on Japanese war criminals without the recognition and approval of the Chinese people are all illegal and invalid.

### 反对美国释放日本侵华战犯

　　反对美国释放日本侵华战犯
    美国管制日本的统帅麦克阿瑟，竟于二十四日擅自释放十九名日本重要战犯，并公开宣布日本境内主要战犯之审判，“业已结束”，“今后不再着手任何审判”。在这批被私自释放的战犯中，包括许多直接屠杀中国人民的刽子手和侵略中国的罪魁，如前日寇中国派遣军司令西尾寿造，前上海日本海军特务机关长儿玉誉志夫，前注南京伪政府大使谷正之等。
    美国政府的这一倒行逆施，是它的一贯反动政策的必然结果。美国帝国主义者早已不顾苏联和其他盟国人民的正义舆论，一意孤行，把日本战犯看作自家人。他们对日本战犯始终采取了袒护、包庇的政策。当远东国际军事法庭对日本二十五名首要战犯宣布判决书以后，我们即曾指出：中国人民对东条等七名战犯判处绞刑，表示满意，但对其他重大战犯的判刑实行宽大，则表示不满和愤慨。美国反动派甚至对这样一个不能令人完全满意的判决，还竭力想推翻和破坏它。只是在世界正义舆论的反对下，美国反动派才被迫将东条等七名战犯执刑，无可奈何地做了一件麦克阿瑟所谓“本心所不愿为而不得不为”之事。鉴于这次审判的结果究竟不能让美国指挥如意，现在美国反动派对日本其他重要战犯，竟干脆宣布释放和取消审判了！
    对于美国反动派的这一卑劣的罪恶行为，世界进步人民不能不表示愤怒，中国人民是尤其不能不坚决反对。因为这是对遭受日本法西斯侵害的各民族尊严的侵犯，特别是对蒙受日本法西斯侵害最早和最烈的中国人民的侮辱。在抗日战争中的中国千百万受难者的鲜血不能白流，千百万的鳏寡孤独的冤仇必须伸雪。因此，中国人民对此不能不表示严正的抗议。中国人民认为，没有取得中国人民的承认和批准，对日本战犯的任何不合理的决定和判决，都一概非法和无效。
