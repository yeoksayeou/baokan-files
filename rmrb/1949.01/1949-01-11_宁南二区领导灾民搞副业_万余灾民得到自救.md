(Jinan Telegram) The Second District of Southern Ning is earnestly leading disaster victims in production for self-salvation, and the lives of over ten thousand disaster victims have been secured. This district has ten flood-stricken villages, with 3,036 households and 10,393 people. The autumn harvest of the year before last was poor, and the wheat harvest last year was also meager. Autumn crops yielded no grain due to the flood. After the autumn harvest, the masses were passively waiting for government relief and planning to flee the famine. Based on this situation, the district leadership proposed "production for self-salvation." The county also established a production promotion cooperative to purchase finished products and supply raw materials, systematically assisting the masses in production. With village cadres and Party members as the core, village production committees were generally organized, and representatives from spinning, saltpeter production, and transportation were absorbed, establishing production groups for spinning, saltpeter extraction, and transportation. In Songjia Village, with 625 households and 2,225 people, fewer than 20 households were engaged in saltpeter extraction before; after organization and mobilization, the number increased to 79 households in October, and the number of saltpeter leaching ponds increased from 8 to 21. In Beiyu Village, statistics from September to October showed that the number of households engaged in saltpeter extraction increased from 90 to 221, and the number of leaching ponds increased from 26 to 41. Songjia River has a total of 1,300 people. In the past, women did not spin or weave. In October, 270 women participated in spinning, using 210 spinning wheels and 33 looms. Now, the number of spinning women has increased to 375, the number of spinning wheels has increased to 316, and the number of looms has increased to 44. In Wangjia Village, 38 households use 45 small carts for transportation, and 133 people are engaged in mat weaving, earning 2,500 bundles per month. The raw materials for one mat cost 10 yuan, and the finished mat can be sold for 25 yuan.

　　宁南二区领导灾民搞副业
  　万余灾民得到自救
    【冀南电】宁南二区认真领导灾民生产自救，万余灾民生活有了保障。该区十个水灾村，三千零三十六户，一万零三百九十三口人。前年秋歉收，去年麦收又薄，秋苗因水灾未见籽粒。秋收后，群众只是消极等待政府救济和打算逃荒。区领导上根据这一情况，提出“生产自救”，县里也建立生产推进社，收买成品，供给原料，有计划地扶助群众生产。以村干党员为核心，普遍组织了村的生产委员会，并吸收纺织、硝民、运输代表参加，建立了纺织、刮硝、运输等生产小组。宋家庄六百二十五户、二千二百二十五口人，以前刮硝的不足二十户；经过组织动员，十月份即增至七十九户，淋硝池由八个增至二十一个。北鱼村从九月到十月份统计，刮硝的由九十户增至二百二十一户，淋硝池由二十六个增到四十一个。宋家河共有一千三百人，历年来妇女不纺织，十月份二百七十名妇女参加纺织。纺车二百一十辆，织布机三十三架；现纺妇增至三百七十五人，纺花车增至三百一十六辆，织布机增至四十四架。王家庄三十八户，四十五辆小车搞运输，一百三十三人参加编席，每月出席二千五百领，一领席的原料需十元，织成后能卖二十五元。
