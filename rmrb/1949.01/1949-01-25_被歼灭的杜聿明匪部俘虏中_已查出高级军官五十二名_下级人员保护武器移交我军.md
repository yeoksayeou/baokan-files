Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, January 23rd: When the Du Yuming bandit group was annihilated, many lower-level personnel disregarded the reactionary orders of the Du bandits to destroy weapons and materials, and completely preserved the weapons and materials for transfer to the People's Liberation Army. Bai Yonghua, a driver of an enemy artillery regiment, and Lü Shengyi, a driver of a motor vehicle company of the 100th Army, after receiving orders to destroy equipment, instead intensified their guarding of the vehicles. When the People's Liberation Army arrived, they obeyed orders and drove the vehicles one after another to the rear of the liberated areas. The artillerymen of the 4th Artillery Regiment secretly buried parts of the six howitzers, faked destruction, and reported and handed them over as soon as the People's Liberation Army arrived. Chen Shanhua, a telegraph operator of the 71st Army headquarters, told the radio operators, "Our radio cannot be destroyed. Carry it to the People's Liberation Army and you will be treated favorably." Although they were exhausted from hunger, they took turns carrying the radio and handed it over to the People's Liberation Army. Many other medical personnel preserved medical equipment, and quartermasters handed over silver dollars and banknotes they had preserved, and were rewarded by the People's Liberation Army. Weapons and materials that had been destroyed or hidden by the Du bandits were also discovered by the People's Liberation Army in several locations around Chenguanzhuang. The captured Kuomintang officers and soldiers are now actively confessing to the People's Liberation Army the crimes of Du bandits and other bandit leaders in destroying weapons and materials.
