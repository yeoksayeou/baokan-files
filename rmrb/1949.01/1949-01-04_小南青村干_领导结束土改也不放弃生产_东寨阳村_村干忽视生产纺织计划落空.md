Xiao Nanqing Village Cadres
　　Leading Production Even After Land Reform Ends
    Dongzhaiyang Village
　　Village Cadres Neglect Production, Textile Plan Fails
    In Xiao Nanqing Village, Fourth District of Huguan, winter production was launched in conjunction with the end of land reform. The movement began by addressing the "thinking among village cadres that production should only be carried out after land reform is completed." For example, village chief Guo Pianhai said: "Let's not be like we were in the spring, when we heard about party rectification, and everyone just laid down and didn't properly lead the masses in production, which resulted in great losses for production and suffering for the masses. This time, we must follow the instructions of the higher authorities, and we must do a good job of ending land reform, and we must not abandon production leadership." After discussion, the cadres divided up the work. In this way, the whole village carried out winter production in a led and organized manner. According to statistics from eight days, transportation alone earned 15,000 yuan in new currency.
    In Dongzhaiyang Village, Second District of Neiqiu, cadres neglected production leadership during the end of land reform, and the textile plan drawn up after the autumn harvest for one month fell through. Out of 127 women who spun in the village, 104 were organized, including 45 weavers. The original plan was for each person to spin four taels of thread per day, seven and a half catties per month, and weave two bolts of cloth per month through self-spinning and self-weaving; however, each person only spun an average of eight and a half qian per day, and wove one bolt of cloth per month. The main reasons for not completing the task: First, the cadres were only busy with the end of land reform and abandoned leadership over production. Second, the plan was not based on reality. The amount of spinning and weaving was only calculated according to the number of people and days. Third, the publicity of policies was not done well during the end of land reform, and no attention was paid to solving the ideological problems of the masses. Households with more land were worried about having their land taken away, and households with less land wanted to wait for more to be distributed. There was a feeling that they would not be at ease with production until land reform was over, and the enthusiasm for spinning and weaving was not high. (Taihang Xinhua Daily).

### 小南青村干　领导结束土改也不放弃生产  东寨阳村　村干忽视生产纺织计划落空

  　领导结束土改也不放弃生产
    东寨阳村
  　村干忽视生产纺织计划落空
    壶关四区小南青村，结合结束土改开展了冬季生产。运动的开展首先是解决村干部中的“等结束土改后再进行生产的思想”。如村长郭偏孩说：“咱们不要再象春天那样，听说要整党哩，大家就躺倒了，不好好领导群众生产，结果使生产受到很大损失，群众吃了亏。这次一定要照上级指示，结束土改要搞好，也不放弃生产领导。”经过研究，干部即进行了分工。这样全村有领导有组织的开展了冬季生产。八天统计，只运输一项即赚新币一万五千元。
    内邱二区东寨阳村在结束土改中，干部忽视了生产领导，秋后订出的一月纺织计划落了空。全村一百二十七个纺织妇女，组织起来的一百零四人，内有四十五个织妇。原计划每天每人纺四两线，一月纺七斤半，自纺自织一月每人织两匹布；结果每人每日平均只纺八钱半，一月织了一匹布。没完成任务的主要原因：第一、干部只忙于结束土改，放弃了对生产的领导。第二、订计划没根据实际出发。只是按人按天计算了纺织数目。第三、结束土改中，宣传政策工作做得不好，没有注意解决群众的思想问题。地多一些的户，顾虑怕抽地，地少一点的户，想等待再分些，存在着土改不结束不安心生产的思想，纺织情绪也不高。（太行新华日报）。
