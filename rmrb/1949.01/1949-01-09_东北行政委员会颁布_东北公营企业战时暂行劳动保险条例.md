Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. The Northeast Administrative Committee promulgated the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations" on the 27th of last month. The promulgation of this regulation is one of the most significant victories in the current Chinese workers' movement. It indicates that workers in enterprises operated by the Chinese People's Government have begun to receive guarantees for improving their lives. Although this regulation is still limited by the current wartime conditions, its important historical significance is not diminished. It is known that there is no labor insurance clause at all in the laws of colonial countries. Although capitalist countries have labor insurance, the labor insurance fund is borne by the workers themselves. This cannot be compared with the Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance conditions, which stipulate that the insurance fund is borne by the management organs of each enterprise. The struggle of Chinese workers for labor insurance benefits for more than 20 years has now been victoriously realized for the first time on the land of New Democracy. The order issued by the Northeast Administrative Committee for the promulgation of the regulations and the full text of the regulations are as follows:

    Northeast Administrative Committee Order (Labor No. 1)
    December 27th, 37th Year of the Republic of China
    Regarding the promulgation of the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations":
    In order to protect the health of workers and staff in public enterprises and alleviate their wartime living difficulties, it is decided to implement labor insurance in Northeast public enterprises based on possible wartime conditions. Therefore, the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations" are formulated and promulgated. These regulations will be provisionally implemented in state-owned railways, mines, military industries, military supplies, postal and telecommunications, electrical, textile, and other enterprises starting from April 1st of next year. Other state-owned enterprises wishing to implement labor insurance must submit a request to this committee for approval from the enterprise manager and the person in charge of its competent authority. Before implementing labor insurance, each enterprise must first pay two months of labor insurance funds, which will be fully preserved in a government-designated bank as a general fund. To this end, it is specifically decided:
    1. The above-mentioned state-owned enterprises must pay labor insurance premiums on a monthly basis starting from January of next year. The enterprise manager shall pay an amount equal to 3% of the total expenditure of the enterprise on each wage payment day. For the months of January and February of next year, the full amount will be used as the total labor insurance fund. Starting from March of next year, 70% of the labor insurance fund that each enterprise should pay shall be kept in the enterprise for the purpose of paying labor insurance expenses for the enterprise's employees. The remaining 30% shall be paid to the designated bank and included in the labor insurance general fund.
    2. Designate the Northeast Bank to act as an agent for the receipt and expenditure of the labor insurance general fund.
    3. Each enterprise shall allocate the labor insurance general fund on time each month and pay it in full to the local or nearby Northeast Bank or Northeast Bank branch.
    4. The entrusted bank shall prepare four copies of the receipt when receiving the labor insurance fund. One copy shall be delivered to the payer, one copy shall be sent to the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions for record, one copy shall be sent to the trade union organization of the enterprise, and one copy shall be kept as a stub.
    5. The Northeast Bank shall prepare a report on the amount of the labor insurance general fund collected on a monthly basis and send it to the Labor Bureau of this committee and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions for record.
    6. From the date of receipt of the order, the enterprise manager and the enterprise trade union of each state-owned enterprise shall jointly organize the enterprise labor insurance committee and make all preparations for the implementation of labor insurance in the enterprise on April 1st of next year before the end of February of next year.
    7. The Labor Bureau of this committee is responsible for working with the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions to formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the labor insurance regulations and announce them before the end of February of next year.
    It is hoped that all relevant state-owned enterprises, trade unions at all levels, and entrusted banks will comply with this order.

　　东北行政委员会颁布
  　东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例
    【新华社哈尔滨七日电】东北行政委员会在上月二十七日颁布“东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例”。这一条例的颁布，是目前中国职工运动最有意义的胜利之一。它表明在中国人民政府所经营的企业中的工人已经开始得到了改善生活的保障。虽然这一条例还受着目前战时条件的限制，但是它的重要历史意义并不因此减弱。人们知道，在殖民地国家的法律里，是根本没有劳动保险这一条的，资本主义国家虽然有劳动保险，但是劳动保险基金是要工人自己负担的，这与东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条件所规定的，保险基金由各企业管理机关负担，是不能相提并论的。中国职工二十余年来的争取劳动保险利益的斗争，如今已在新民主主义的土地上，第一次胜利实现了。东北行政委员会颁布该条例所发出之命令及该条例之全文如下：
    东北行政委员会令（劳字第一号）

    二、指定东北银行代理劳动保险总基金收支业务。
    三、各企业每月按时拨出劳动保险总基金后，应即全部缴存于当地或附近之东北银行或东北银行分行。
    四、接受委托之银行于收到劳动保险基金时，须备有四联收款证件，一件交付缴款人，一件送交东北职工总会备查，一件送交该企业之职工会组织，一件作为存根。
    五、东北银行须将所收劳动保险总基金数目，按月造具报告表，分送本会劳动总局及东北职工总会各一份备查。
