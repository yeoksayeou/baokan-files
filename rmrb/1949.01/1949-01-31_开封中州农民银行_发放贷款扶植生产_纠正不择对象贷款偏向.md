Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 28th: After the liberation of Kaifeng, the Kaifeng branch of the Zhongzhou Farmers Bank actively issued loans to assist the government in promoting production and construction, and has achieved initial results. The purpose of the bank's loans is to support the recovery and development of handicrafts and household sideline production, as well as industrial and commercial enterprises related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. From the bank's establishment to the end of last year, a total of 14,438,000 yuan (Zhongzhou currency) was issued in loans. Among them, industrial and mining loans accounted for 5,524,000 yuan, accounting for more than 38 percent of the total loans. Among these, the electric light company and machine milling industry, which are related to military and civilian use, were the main loan recipients, accounting for 69 percent of the total industrial and mining loans. Commercial loans amounted to 3,035,000 yuan, accounting for more than 21 percent of the total loans, and coal transportation loans accounted for 765,000 yuan of the commercial loans. Small-scale production loans accounted for more than 40 percent of the total. In the issuance of small-scale production loans, 5,426 households of female shoe workers, etc., were organized to engage in shoe production; and 1,046 households of handicraftsmen and small vendors, etc., were organized to engage in spinning, weaving, weaving towels, and transporting grain. In this way, not only was the supply of materials to the front lines supported and market supply and demand were adjusted, but also their living difficulties were solved. For example, 38 households in Cengtun in the seventh district went to Weishi County to transport wheat to Kaifeng for sale after receiving transportation loans, which solved their living expenses. Zhao Jinchao and Zhao Jinli of Jiamiao Hou Street purchased wool to make felt carpets after borrowing 9,000 yuan, and were able to make five or six pieces for sale every day on average. In the bank's two months of successful lending work, some deviations also occurred. This was due to insufficient publicity and explanation of the loan policy, lax loan procedures, and a lack of in-depth inspection and supervision of production work. For example, the Fifth District Government of the city introduced brokers and doctors of traditional Chinese medicine from calico shops to the bank for loans of 8,000 yuan each, without discriminating against the loan recipients. In the process of handling loans on behalf of the Fourth District Government, it failed to handle the guarantee procedures with caution, resulting in the discovery of many false contracts, which caused the bank to lose 120,000 yuan. Li Chunfang of Shuarong Street forged false names and house numbers to fraudulently obtain two loans. These deviations are being corrected.

　　开封中州农民银行
  　发放贷款扶植生产
  　纠正不择对象贷款偏向
    【新华社开封二十八日电】开封市解放后，中州农民银行开封分行为协助政府推进生产建设，特积极发放贷款，已获初步成效。该行发放贷款之目的，在扶植手工业和家庭副业生产及与国计民生有关的工商业的恢复和发展。该行自成立至去年底的两月当中，计共发放贷款一千四百四十三万八千余元（中州币，下同）。其中工矿贷款占五百五十二万四千元，为贷款总数的百分之三十八强，这里面又以有关军需民用的电灯公司和机器磨面业为主要贷款户，贷款数占工矿贷款总数的百分之六十九。商业贷款三百零三万五千元，占贷款总数的百分之二十一强，而商业贷款之中运煤贷款则占七十六万五千元；小本生产贷款，占总数的百分之四十强。在发放小本生产贷款中，组织了五千四百二十六户鞋工之家庭妇女等，从事做鞋生产；又组织了一千零四十六户手工业者、小商贩等，使其从事纺纱、织布、织毛巾及贩运粮食等生产。如此，既支援了前线的物资供给，调剂了市场供求，又解决了他们的生活困难。如七区曾屯三十八户，得到运销贷款后，即往尉氏县运小麦到开封贩卖，便解决了他们的生活费用问题。家庙后街的赵金超、赵金礼，贷款九千元后，即回家购买羊毛制毡毯，平均每天能制五、六条出售。在该行两个月的已获成效的贷款工作中也发生了一些偏向，这是因为对贷款方针宣传解释不够，贷款手续不严，和检查督促生产工作不深入的原故。如该市五区区政府不择贷款对象介绍了花布行的经纪人和中医到银行各贷了八千元款子；四区区政府在代办贷款中，因不能慎重办理对保手续，结果发现了很多假契约，使银行亏损了十二万元；刷绒街李春芳，伪造假名字、门牌，骗取两次贷款。这些偏向正在纠正中。
