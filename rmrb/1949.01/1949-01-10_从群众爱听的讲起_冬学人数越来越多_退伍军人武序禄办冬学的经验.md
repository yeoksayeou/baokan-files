　　Starting from What the Masses Love to Hear
  　Winter School Enrollment Increases
  　Veteran Wu Xulu's Experience in Running Winter School
    [Taihang News] Wu Xulu, a demobilized soldier and volunteer teacher in Longquan Village, Wu'an, has improved the winter school by starting from what the masses love to hear. After returning to the village from county training, he first discussed the specific methods of running the winter school at a village cadre meeting. On November 16th of last year, the teacher first made a review of the previous winter school at a general meeting and said confidently, "This year I have been trained, and I must make sure everyone understands some things." It was also decided to hold winter school on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days of the month.
    On the first day of class, he presented the entire set of things he had learned in training to the masses for discussion, such as understanding the Communist Party and how the Eighth Route Army grew stronger. The masses did not speak. Later, they just talked randomly about unrelated things. Only a little over ten people came.
    This situation caused the teacher to consider: Why are fewer people coming, and why don't they say anything when they come? After the winter school ended, he followed the masses to listen to their feedback, because many people didn't sleep and were talking and joking in small shops. Why do the masses love to talk at this time? After repeated consideration, he found the reasons why they didn't speak up in winter school: one was that they were not informed beforehand, and the content they learned was forced on the masses for discussion without specific topics. The second was that the masses loved to hear stories, and his own lectures were too rigid.
    After accepting this lesson, he improved his teaching methods and also made preparations in advance. On the first day of winter school, he announced the topics on the public blackboard, such as the first topic: "The Origin of the City God." At that time, old men Wu Lunshun and Bai Linghan stopped him on the street and said, "Tell us how it came to be!" The teacher said, "Let's talk about it in winter school." More people came that day and loved to listen. Afterwards, he continued to announce the subjects, such as "Mice pulling a wooden plough, with the big head behind," using metaphors to explain social development and good life in the future (future education). The story of the great foreman (Chairman Mao), the story of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as the relationship between the sun, moon, and earth, and scientific stories about wind, clouds, thunder, and rain (anti-superstition education). After each story, he related it to the current affairs and victory news, which made the masses even more interested, and the number of people gradually increased to more than eighty.
    The village head, Party branch secretary, director of the farmers' association, and other main cadres in the village were very concerned about the winter school and led by example by arriving early every day. Cooperative personnel also sent one person to participate due to busy business and went back to study. In order to adapt to the needs of the central work, the winter school was changed to once a day. Because the victory news was publicized, pointing out the victorious prospect of fundamentally overthrowing the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek in about a year, it played a great role in the work of expanding the army. Youth Wu Sanhe automatically signed up to join the army and proposed, "I will only come back after fighting to Nanjing and capturing Chiang Kai-shek alive."
    In addition to attending winter school, the teacher also wrote blackboard newspapers in a timely manner based on newspaper materials. Carried out oral publicity, and also organized a mass reading group. In order to encourage the masses to listen regularly, he opened a small shop in a small temple that the masses were accustomed to visit and was centrally located, solving his own livelihood problems on the one hand, and consolidating the newspaper reading group on the other hand. The room had simple equipment, a portrait of Chairman Mao, slogans, and a copy of the People's Daily. Many people would go there to ask for newspaper readings when they were free. Preparations are now being made to establish newspaper reading groups in the cooperative and oil mill, with the accountant responsible for reading.
    The main reasons for the success of the winter school in this village are first, the teacher has high work enthusiasm and firm confidence, does not bow or lose heart when encountering difficulties, and can go deep into the masses to discover problems and improve his work methods. In terms of village cadres, they can lead by example, attend winter school first, drive the masses, and actively solve the problems in winter school, realizing that winter school is also their own work.

### 从群众爱听的讲起　冬学人数越来越多　退伍军人武序禄办冬学的经验

　　从群众爱听的讲起
  　冬学人数越来越多
  　退伍军人武序禄办冬学的经验
    【太行讯】武安龙泉村义务教员退伍军人武序禄从群众爱听的讲起，把冬学搞好了。他自县集训回村后，首先在村干部会议上研究了冬学的具体做法，去年十一月十六日教员首先在大会上把前年冬学做了个检讨，并有信心的说：“今年我受了训，一定要好好叫大家明白一些事。”并确定三、六、九日上冬学。
    头一天上课时，他把集训所学的一套原封不动地让大众来讨论，如对共产党的认识、八路军如何壮大起来的等，群众都不发言，后来也只七东八西的乱扯一气。来的人数也只有十多个。
    这个情况就引起了教员的考虑：为什么人来的少，来了也不吭呢？在散了冬学时，他就跟着群众听反映，因为有好多人不睡觉在小铺里说东道西扯笑话谈故事，说得很热闹。为什么群众这时很爱说话呢？经过反复的考虑，找出了在冬学不吭气的原因：一个是事前不讲，硬把所学的内容叫群众讨论，题又不具体。再一个是群众爱听故事性的东西，自己讲的太生硬。
    他接受了这个教训后，就进行改进自己的教学方法，同时也先做了准备工作；上冬学的头一天在大众黑板上公布题目，如第一次是：“城隍爷的由来”，当时就有老汉武伦顺、白令汉在街上拦住说：“你到底给俺说说怎样来的？”教员说：“咱到冬学说吧。”当天来的人就多了，并且很爱听。以后便继续公布课目，如“老鼠拖木锨，大头在后边”用比喻说明社会发展，好生活在后边（前途教育）。伟大的长工头（毛主席）、毛主席和朱总司令的故事，还有太阳月亮和地球的关系，风、云、雷、雨等科学故事（反迷信教育）。每说一个故事后，就联系目前的时事胜利消息，这样群众更感兴趣，人数逐渐增多到八十多个。
    该村村长支书农会主任等主要干部对冬学很关心，以身作则，每天早到。合作社人员因业务忙也派一人来参加，回去研究。为了适应中心工作的需要，冬学改成每天上一次。因为宣传了胜利消息，指出一年左右从根本上打倒蒋介石反动政府的胜利前途，在扩军工作上起了很大作用，青年武三何自动报名参军，提出“打到南京去活捉蒋介石才回来。”
    除上冬学外，教员并根据报纸材料及时的写黑板报。进行口头宣传，同时又组织了群众读报组。为了使群众经常去听，就在群众习惯爱去而又适中的一个小庙里，开了一个小铺，一方面解决自己的生活问题，一方面巩固读报组，房内有简单的设备，毛主席像、标语、及一份人民日报、很多人没事就去要求读报。现正准备在合作社、油房内成立读报组，由会计负责读。
    这村冬学搞好的主要原因，首先是教员有高度的工作热情和坚定的信心，见困难不低头、不灰心，能深入群众发现问题，改进自己的工作方法；在村干部方面能以身作则，首先上冬学，带动了群众，并主动的解决冬学内的问题，认识了冬学也是自己的工作。
