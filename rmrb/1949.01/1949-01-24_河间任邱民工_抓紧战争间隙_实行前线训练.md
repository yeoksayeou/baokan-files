　　Hejian Renqiu Laborers
  　Seize War Intervals
  　to Implement Frontline Training
    [Jizhong Tianjin Frontline Telegram] Reporter Shi Lian reports: The Hejian and Renqiu stretcher teams dispatched to the Tianjin front, each with five companies, seized the intervals between battles to carry out training for the laborers in their stationed villages, in order to successfully complete the task of supporting the liberation of Tianjin. The training lasted six days and was very successful. In addition to educating the laborers on the victorious situation and battlefield discipline before their deployment, the Hejian stretcher team also organized discussions in groups based on squads to further inspire the laborers' enthusiasm for supporting the front. Finally, through the active efforts of squads and platoons, they promoted the national front-line merit campaign. Each squad discussed merit regulations, and a heated challenge arose between the companies: "Do not violate mass discipline, resolutely obey orders and listen to commands, do not return home until Tianjin is liberated!" This was the unanimous merit condition of all the laborers in their regiment. Each squad posted their merit conditions in their living quarters and checked them every day. In the implementation of mass discipline, they created a new method of laborers managing laborers. Companies organized discipline inspection teams that rotated daily to inspect each squad. Yang Shuxia, the squad leader of the Second Company, since participating in the discipline inspection team, gets up before dawn every day, first sweeps the courtyard where he lives, and then takes the broom to go to the squads. If he sees that the landlord's water vat in a squad's house is empty, he carries a bucket to fetch water; if the yard is not clean, he starts sweeping, which has a great influence on the entire company. When the Renqiu stretcher team was training in the garrison, they first improved the Party committees at all levels, the company's branch, the squad's groups, and other leading Party cores at all levels. With the active leadership of Party members across the country, they launched a four-comparison movement, comparing their past lives, their current situation, the hardships of the soldiers at the front, and their political awareness, inspiring the laborers' class consciousness and enthusiasm for supporting the front, ensuring the consolidation of the country. Now many laborers are voluntarily asking to go to the front to earn merit. The Hejian and Renqiu stretcher teams have made significant progress after this training. Since the rectification, none of the more than 1,300 laborers in the two regiments have deserted. At the same time, it corrected some laborers' incorrect ideas, such as wanting to make a fortune. There were also some who, because they ran to Tianjin to trade and were subjected to Chiang Kai-shek's oppression, were determined to capture prisoners and take revenge this time. After training, they understood battlefield discipline and prisoner of war policies. The Renqiu stretcher team, which was previously uneasy, was relieved after the training and wrote letters home, reporting the life outside and the situation of the army surrounding Tianjin, telling their families to rest assured. Whenever the Hejian laborers heard about transferring the wounded, each squad would rush to go. They would rush back in one day after a seventy-mile round trip. When they saw the army heading towards Tianjin, they were overjoyed, each squad busily tidying up their stretchers and ropes, eager to go to the battlefield to earn merit.

    【冀中平津前线电】记者石联报导：出征平津前线的河间、任邱担架团各五个连，他们为了胜利的完成支援解放平津的任务，抓住了战争空隙，在驻村分头展开对民工的训练工作。共进行了六天，成绩很大。河间担架团除在队前对民工进行胜利形势和战场纪律的教育外，并以班为单位出题讨论，进一步启发民工的支前热情。最后又通过了积极的班排，推动了全国的前线立功竞赛运动。各班都讨论了立功规约，连与连掀起了热烈的挑战：“不违犯群众纪律，坚决服从命令听指挥，不打下平津不回家！”是他们全团民工一致的立功条件。各班都把他们的立功条件贴在住的屋子里，每天检查。他们在执行群众纪律上，创造了民工管理民工的新办法。以连为单位组织检查纪律小组，每天轮流到各班检查。二连的班长杨树匣，自从参加了检查纪律小组，每天不等天明就起来，先将自己住的院里门口扫净，再提着扫帚到各班去串，见到那班房东瓮里没水，提桶就担；那家院里不净，动手就扫，对全连影响很大。任邱担架团在驻地训练时，首先健全了各级党委会，连的支部，班的小组等各级党的领导核心，以全国党员积极带动，展开了和过去比生活，比光景，比前方战士的艰苦，比政治觉悟等四比运动，启发民工的阶级觉悟，和支前热情，保证了全国的巩固。现在不少民工自动要求到前方去立功。河间任邱担架团经过这次训练，都有显著的进步。两个团一千三百多民工，自整训以来，没有一个开小差的。同时也纠正了部分民工想发洋财等不正确思想。还有的因为长跑天津作买卖，受过蒋匪的制，这次蹩着劲要捉住俘虏报仇。经过训练，他们已懂得了战场纪律和俘虏政策。任邱担架团以前情绪不安的，训练后都安了心，纷纷给家里写信，报告外边的生活和大军包围平津的情况，告诉家里放心。河间民工一听到转送伤员，各班都是抢着要去。来回七十里路，一天就赶回来。他们一见到军队向平津开，都乐的手舞足蹈，各班忙着整理自己的担架拴绳子，鼓足了劲要到战场上去立功。
