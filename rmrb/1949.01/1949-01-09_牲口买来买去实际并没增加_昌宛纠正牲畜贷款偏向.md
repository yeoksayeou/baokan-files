　　Livestock bought and sold without actually increasing
　　Changwan corrects the bias in livestock loans
　　[North Yue News] The Changwan County Promotion Society's distribution of livestock loans has generated a blind, purely task-oriented viewpoint. The county lacks livestock, making cultivation difficult. To solve this problem, the county specifically decided to issue draught animal loans to help farmers increase their livestock. However, when the county production promotion society was completing this task, it neither distributed the loans based on specific circumstances nor provided specific guidance and inspection, so the loans did not achieve the desired effect: loan recipients did not go to livestock-producing areas outside the region to buy livestock, but bought and sold within the local area, which meant the livestock did not increase. More seriously, Du Chenggong and three others from Xialing borrowed 1.2 million Jichaos and used part of the funds to buy 130 packs of cigarettes and 20 catties of wine. This completely violated the purpose of the loan. Now the county promotion society has discovered the above bias and has conducted a review. In order to correct the bias and continue the distribution, it is specifically stipulated that those who borrow to buy livestock must go to external areas with high livestock production. When providing loans, emphasis should be placed on leveraging private capital to prevent the idea of solely relying on loans. After the loan is issued, an immediate inspection should be carried out, and those who do not use it to purchase livestock should be immediately prohibited, or the funds should be recovered and lent to other households.

　　牲口买来买去实际并没增加
  　昌宛纠正牲畜贷款偏向
    【北岳讯】昌宛县推进社发放牲畜贷款产生盲目单纯任务观点。该县牲畜缺乏，耕种困难。为解决这一困难，县里特决定发放耕畜贷款，扶助农民增畜。但县生产推进社在完成这一任务时，一没根据具体情况发放，二没做具体指导与检查，使贷款未得到应有效果：贷款户买牲口不到产牲口的外区去买，而在本地买来买去，结果等于牲口没有增加。更严重的，下马岭杜成功等四人贷了一百二十万冀钞，用一部款买了纸烟一百三十条，酒二十斤。完全违背了贷款的目的。现在该县推进社已发现了上述偏向，并进行了检讨。为纠正偏向和继续发放，特规定：贷款买牲口者一定到出产牲口多的外区去买。贷款时要重视带动私资，防止单纯依靠贷款的思想。贷款后应立即检查，不用于购买牲口者立即禁止，或将款收回另贷别户。
