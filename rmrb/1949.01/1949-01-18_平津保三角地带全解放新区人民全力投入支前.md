[Jizhong Pingjin Frontline Dispatch] Comprehensive report: The powerful Northeast and North China People's Liberation Armies have tightly surrounded Pingjin. The Pingjinbao triangle area, which was extremely ravaged and devastated by the bandits Chiang, Fu, and Wang, has now been completely liberated, and the people are celebrating their rebirth. The people north of the Daqing River, who were almost suffocated by the exploitation of the bandits Chiang, Fu, and Wang, are now rejoicing. The endless blood and tears of the people north of the Daqing River in the past have now come to an end. Pain, misery, and terror will never come again. The people here deeply know who has come to change this bleak world. They sweep the streets and sprinkle water, build red and green archways at road intersections, set up tea tables, boil water in ground stoves on the highways, hang lanterns in shops, and the gongs and drums resound all day long. The people hold flags and cheer, welcoming the People's Liberation Army who liberated them. The people here have enthusiastically plunged into the huge wave of supporting the liberation of Pingjin, using all their strength to assist the People's Liberation Army in liberating Pingjin. One hundred and eleven large cart platoons, one hundred and four stretcher platoons, and thirty militia platoons have now been organized, and half of them have already been dispatched to the front line to carry out various tasks. More than two thousand women in Baxian and Anci have automatically organized comfort teams and sewing and washing groups. The people here have braved the wind and snow to build more than four hundred miles of roads and erected thirty large and small bridges. The people of Gu'an's Shilipu overcame all difficulties and completed the 47-span, 121-zhang-long, and 1.6-zhang-wide bridge over the Yongding River in just seven days. In terms of grain and firewood supply, 6.95 million jin of various grains, 17.64 million jin of firewood, 3.23 million jin of rough firewood, and 9.49 million jin of grass have been prepared. The people in the new areas of Anci, Daxing, Zhuoliangwan (parts of Zhuoxian, Liangxiang, and Wanping), Gu'an, and Jinwu (parts of Tianjin and Wuqing) have ensured the on-the-spot supply for the large army. They said, "Even if we eat less, we are happy. As long as there is the People's Liberation Army, there will always be food to eat." Hankou Port in Jinwu was asked to allocate 30,000 jin of grain, which was completed in one day. ×× Port handed over 50,000 jin of firewood in one day. Fanliyang Village, a small village of only a few dozen households, also handed over 40,000 jin of firewood in one day. In many villages, every household has ground flour, tidied up their houses, and are waiting for the People's Liberation Army. Villages near Tianjin have established support-the-front committees. The masses in Lifangzi Village, more than ten miles away from Tianjin, automatically prepared five stretchers to stand by. The villages around Beicang Station on the Beining Railway received a notice from the district asking for large carts, and ninety rubber-wheeled carts traveled one hundred and twenty miles overnight and arrived at the designated location in the early morning to accept tasks. In most villages in the seventh district of Jinwu, men are working, and women are standing guard and patrolling, checking pedestrians. The militia newly organized in Moliao Port, no matter how cold the weather, how dark the night, or how piercing the wind, they always patrol the roads and power lines in the dark. In Doudianyao Village, which was set on fire by the Chiang-Fu bandits, leaving only two families, the people were displaced. But now the people of this village have returned to the ruins destroyed by the Chiang bandits, established a public office, prepared grass and grain for the People's Liberation Army, and installed stretchers. They said, "Don't look down on our village because the houses were burned by the Kuomintang. The work of supporting the front cannot lag behind other villages. Taking down Pingjin will avenge us!" This is the power of the people, this is the real language of the people. The people in the Pingjinbao triangle area, who have suffered so much from the cruelty of the Chiang-Fu bandits, have all stood up. They are heading towards victory, and they are willing to sacrifice everything to support the liberation of Pingjin. Jia Wenliang, a civilian worker from the Third Company of the Xin'an County Cart Regiment, had set a date for his wedding, and Zhou Min, a civilian worker from the Third Company, had set a date to betroth his daughter, but they both put these things out of their minds and came to support the front. They said, "We will never celebrate happy events until Pingjin is liberated." Cao Bosheng, an old tenant farmer in Wang Qingtuo in his fifties, said, "People are of one mind now. We have been waiting and waiting, early and late, for this!"
