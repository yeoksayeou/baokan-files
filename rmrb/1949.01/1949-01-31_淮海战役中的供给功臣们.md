Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 18th. When the People's Liberation Army was encircling and annihilating the Kuomintang bandit Huang Wei Corps in the Suxian-Mengcheng area, all members of the Supply Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army delivered a large amount of flour, firewood, and ammunition to the front line with amazing enthusiasm. This well-organized supply work is one of the important factors in the victorious operation of annihilating the Huang Wei Corps this time.

Before the war, due to the long march, the brigades and regiments had temporarily dispersed to raise food. After the war began, in order to facilitate supply and reduce the burden on the local people, the superiors requested that all grain and grass be concentrated for unified planning and expenditure. Upon receiving this order, the Supply Department immediately contacted the local government and sent cadres and government personnel to jointly establish grain stations. In just five days, the task of concentrating grain was completed. In order to solve the difficulties of eating vegetables and oil on the front line, they also jointly established supply stations with the government, ensuring that the commanders and fighters on the front line had vegetables and oil to eat during the twenty-odd days of battle.

The supply task undertaken by the Supply Department was arduous. Therefore, the superiors had considered the difficulties of the supply personnel and decided to send a company to help them escort the vehicles. However, they refused, saying that this company should not be used in the rear, but should be used to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front line. What methods did they use to solve their own manpower difficulties? They mobilized all the logistics personnel and all the cadres of the Supply Department to directly serve on the transportation line. They raised food during the day and led the vehicles at night. In order to reduce the trouble for the civilian laborers, they set up tea stations and fodder stations on the transportation line, which greatly improved the enthusiasm of the civilian laborers in transporting military supplies. The load capacity of the carts was increased, and some carts even carried 1,500 catties each.

For a few days, in order to supply all the oil and salt to the front line, they themselves could not eat oil and salt, without any complaints. Communication soldier Li Qingyun and feeder Yin Jiuxiang served on the transportation line and did not sleep for seven consecutive days and nights. Their eyes were red and their legs were sore from running. When the superiors asked them to rest, they said: "In the past, our work was not outstanding. This time, in the Xuzhou campaign, we want to make contributions for the people!" At night, it rained, and their clothes were wet. They braved the severe north wind and trudged on the muddy road, always persisting in their work.

The wounded at the front needed charcoal. Storekeeper Wei Hulan ran from Mengcheng to Guoyang, and from Guoyang to Hao County, but could not buy it. So he made up his mind: to do it himself. He consulted with the common people, borrowed a charcoal kiln, transported a batch of firewood, and started burning it himself - he burned 380 catties in a day and a half, and personally sent it to the front line. The wounded needed milk, and supply clerk Liang Quanfu went to buy it a hundred miles away; the wounded wanted white sugar, and he also ran to buy it, without any complaints. Audit Section Chief Li Bingrang went to the office to collect money, grain, and firewood. He ran three times on the 180-mile road without any fatigue. Grain officer Yang Zifang and grain collection team leader He Defa once unloaded 105 large carts of flour in one night. He Defa got sick, but he still ran around to negotiate vehicles and other issues. Grain officer Wang Shanghe and guard Guan Dexin's feet were crushed by a car, but they still supported themselves with crutches to weigh firewood and flour, working tirelessly. The comrades in the Audit Section defended against air raids during the day and slept in the open at night next to the carts, guarding the supplies they were responsible for. All these heroes who supplied various materials needed for the front line worked tirelessly for thirteen days and nights. Their efforts have a price, and that price is: the complete annihilation of the Huang Wei Corps!

### 淮海战役中的供给功臣们

　　淮海战役中的供给功臣们
    【新华社淮海前线十八日电】当人民解放军在宿县蒙城地区围歼国民党匪军黄维兵团时，人民解放军某部供给部全体人员，以惊人的积极工作将大量的白面、柴草、弹药送上前线。这种组织得很好的供给工作，是这次歼灭黄维兵团的胜利事业中的重要因素之一。
    战争开始前，因为长途行军，各旅团曾临时分散筹粮。战争开始后，为了供应方便和减轻当地人民的负担，上级要求将所有粮草集中，以便统筹统支。供给部接到这个命令，便马上和当地政府接洽，派出干部和政府人员共同建立粮站，不过五天，把粮食集中的任务完成了。为解决前线吃菜吃油的困难，他们还和政府共同建立供应站，在二十余天战斗中保证前线指战员有菜有油吃。
    供给部担负的供应任务是繁重的。因此上级曾经考虑到供给人员的困难，决定派一个连帮助他们押车。可是他们拒绝了，说这一个连不应使用在后方，应当用来加强前线的战斗力。他们用什么办法来解决自己人力的困难呢？他们把供给部的全体勤杂人员和全体干部动员起来，到运输线上去直接服务。他们白天筹粮，夜晚带车。为减轻民工的麻烦，他们在运输线上设立了茶站、草料站，这样就大大提高了民工运输军需品的积极性，大车的载重量提高了，甚至有些大车每辆载重一千五百斤。
    有几天，为了将一切油盐供给前线，他们自己吃不上油盐，毫无埋怨。通讯员李庆云、饲养员殷九向，在运输线上服务，曾连续七昼夜没有睡觉。眼熬红了，腿跑痛了，上级叫他们休息，他们说：“过去工作不出色，这次徐州会战我们要为人民立功！”夜里下雨，衣服湿了，他们两个冒着凛冽的北风，踏着泥泞的道路，始终坚持工作。
    前方伤员需要木炭。保管员魏虎兰从蒙城跑到涡阳，从涡阳跑毫县，始终买不到。他于是下定决心：亲自动手。他向老百姓商量，借到一个炭窑，运去一批木柴，亲自动手烧起来——一天半烧了三百八十斤，并亲自把它送上前线。伤员需要牛奶，被服员梁全福到百里外去买；伤员要白糖，他也跑去买，丝毫不嫌麻烦。审计科长李秉让同志到办事处去领款子，领粮食，领木柴，一百八十里路，一连跑了三趟，毫无倦容，粮秣员杨子芳和筹粮队长何得法，曾经一夜卸面一百零五大车。何得法得了病，但仍然奔走交涉车辆等问题。粮秣员王尚和及警卫员关得心的脚被车子压坏了，仍然扶着拐杖称柴称面，勤劳不息。审计科的同志们白天防空，晚上露宿在大车跟前，看守着他们负责保管的物资。所有这些供给前线各种物资需要的功臣们，曾经十三昼夜不知疲劳地工作着。他们的努力是有代价的，这个代价就是：把黄维兵团全部歼灭！
