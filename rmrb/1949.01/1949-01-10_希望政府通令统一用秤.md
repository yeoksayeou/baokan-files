To the Editor:

    There is such a problem: The old steelyard balances used by the people in the past were collected once last year, but not all of them were collected. As a result, both new and old steelyard balances are now in use. Most farmers cannot convert between the two, so they suffer losses. Now that private businesses are developing, if they cannot calculate accounts, some businesses will suffer losses. This situation is very common. The people are discussing this matter a lot. Please ask the government to standardize them.

　　希望政府通令统一用秤
    编者同志：
    有这样一个问题：以前人民所用之老秤，在去年收过一次，但没有收完，结果闹的现在新秤也用，旧秤也用。这当中大部分农民是不会折合，所以吃亏，现在正在发展私人营业，算不了帐就得有一家吃亏，这样情形很普遍。人民对此事纷纷议论，请政府统一一下才好。
