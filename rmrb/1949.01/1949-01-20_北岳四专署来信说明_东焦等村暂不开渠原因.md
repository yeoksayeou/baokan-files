　　Letter from the Fourth Administrative Office of the Northern Yue Region Explaining the Reasons for Temporarily Not Opening Canals in Dongjiao and Other Villages
　　To the Editor:
　　Regarding the criticism and suggestion published in your newspaper on December 24th, "Farmers in Dongjiao Village and surrounding thirteen villages eagerly hope that the Huolu and Jingxing governments will take advantage of the winter slack season to lead the opening of canals," we hereby submit our opinions on handling this work and our self-assessment as a response:
　　In August, this office received a letter from Dongjiao and other villages, forwarded by the Huolu government, requesting the government to lead the opening of canals, which stated roughly: "Irrigation of thirteen villages can reach 40,000 mu, requesting loans and assistance to open canals" (only nine villages were signed in the letter, missing the downstream villages of Tongge, North and South Gucheng, and Shaoying). At that time, this office repeatedly studied it and finally believed that this new canal should not be opened for at least three to five years. The reasons are:
　　(1) Insufficient water is the main problem. The Ye River (Wen Shui River) is the most developed river in the Fourth District's water conservancy projects. Before the war, there were seventeen old canals along the river, irrigating 50,100 mu of land. Since the war, five new canals have been built, and four old canals have been widened and lengthened, expanding the irrigated area by a total of 82,100 mu. This includes three canals irrigating a total of 40,000 mu, the Yuanquan Canal irrigating 16,000 mu, and the Yongsheng Canal irrigating 15,000 mu. Now there are twenty-three canals in the Ye River, irrigating a total area of ​​132,200 mu. However, since the Jisan Canal began releasing water in 1947, the water volume has been insufficient. In the summer of 1948, there was a severe drought, and the canal banks completely dammed the Ye River, resulting in insufficient water downstream and inability to irrigate, which caused mass water disputes between upstream and downstream residents. At that time, the method of adjusting the water volume, allowing water to flow through each canal in turn, and taking care of the downstream was adopted, so that most of the canal banks were spared from drought damage. The Jisan Canal, irrigating 40,000 mu, only irrigated 30,000 mu, and less than 20,000 mu were irrigated twice in the spring, with the rest only irrigated once. Due to the drought last year and the fact that the newly built canals were not yet consolidated, water consumption was relatively high, so the 30,000 mu of land in the Jisan Canal was not well irrigated. Building a new canal in the Ye River to irrigate 40,000 mu, according to the water volume in the past one or two years, will inevitably affect the irrigation of existing canals.
　　(2) From the perspective of comprehensive water conservancy development, it is more appropriate to lengthen and widen old canals than to open new canals, saving water and reducing construction costs. The main channels of the Jisan and Yuanquan canals are both more than thirty li long, and the canal tails have extended to the Huolu Plain. Opening new canals requires longer water diversion routes and higher construction costs; the Yuanquan Canal requires more than 100 jin of millet per mu, and the Jisan Canal has exceeded 60 jin. The new canal planned for Dongjiao and other villages is forty li long, and it is estimated that each mu will need to bear at least two da dou of rice. If the Yuanquan and Jisan canals continue to develop, it will be easier and more effective than opening new canals. Furthermore, opening more canal mouths will increase the total length of water intake routes, consuming water and reducing irrigation efficiency. The basic solution to the water volume problem in the existing canals of the Ye River is to unify water intake and distribute it equally per mu. However, the project is huge and requires long-term planning. If this is not taken into account, opening new canals will only affect the existing water conservancy and cause more disputes. At the same time, among the thirteen villages in Dongjiao, except for Dongjiao and Niushan, the other eleven villages can be irrigated by continuing to lengthen and widen the Yuanquan Canal. However, the Yuanquan Canal is currently not sufficiently supplied with water, the project is not yet consolidated, and the burden issue needs to be cleared up, so it cannot be lengthened or widened within three to five years. If the above problems are resolved, it can be widened and lengthened step by step in a planned way to gradually expand the irrigated area.
　　(3) We deeply accept the lessons learned from building large canals in recent years. The Fourth District has built the Lingzheng Canal on the Hutuo River and the Rongzhen Canal on the Sha River. After four to six years of effort, most of the projects have been completed, but due to insufficient estimation of water volume at the beginning and planning only based on subjective desires, the requirements were too high. As a result, we now have to reduce the irrigation area, which has caused dissatisfaction among the masses (the Lingzheng Canal was originally planned to benefit fifty villages, irrigating 1,200 qing of land, but it has now been reduced to twenty-three villages, and we strive to irrigate 600 qing of land within two to three years). The Jisan Canal in the Ye River basin has the same situation. The new canal planned for Dongjiao should deeply consider the existing experiences and lessons and should not be built rashly. This office's opinion was discussed with the head of the Water Conservancy Section of the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Northern Yue Administrative Office; at the end of the cooperative conference held in the special district in August, it was also discussed with the head of the Huolu Industrial Section, who was asked by Huolu to inform Dongjiao and other villages: This canal cannot be built at this time. However, after reading your newspaper on December 24, we learned that the masses have not yet received a response from the government and hope that the government will lead the opening of canals, and even that the failure to open this canal has affected their production enthusiasm. We deeply review this as a lack of thoroughness in our work. We have not gone among the masses to have a good discussion of the things that the masses urgently need, and to explain the situation, and have still made the masses wait anxiously. This is a manifestation of bureaucracy in our work. After seeing the newspaper, we immediately sent people to Dongjiao to convene the masses of the five upstream villages for further understanding. Dongjiao and Niushan are indeed unable to plant vegetables due to dry land, and there are also great difficulties in drinking water, and they are asking to open canals...

### 北岳四专署来信说明　东焦等村暂不开渠原因

1949-01-20
第2版()
专栏：检讨与答复

　　北岳四专署来信说明
  　东焦等村暂不开渠原因编辑同志：
    贵报十二月二十四日刊载：“东焦村一带十三村农民，急盼获鹿、井陉政府快趁冬闲领导开渠”一项批评与建议，谨将我们处理这一工作意见及检查作复如下：
    八月，本署接到经获鹿政府转来东焦等村要求政府领导开渠的信件，略称：“十三村灌溉可达四万亩，请求贷粮扶助开渠”，（信内只有九村署名，缺下游同阁、南北故城、邵营四村）。当时本署曾即多次研究，最后认为这条新渠至少在三、五年内不应开修。原因是：
    （一）水量不足是主要问题。冶河（温水河）是四专水利事业最发展的河流，战前沿河旧渠十七道，浇地五万零一百亩，战后至今修建新渠五道，加宽引长旧渠四道，共扩大浇地面积八万二千一百亩。其中包括灌溉四万亩之计三渠，一万六千亩的源泉渠与一万五千亩的永胜渠，现在冶河共有渠道二十三条，灌溉总面积十三万二千二百亩。但自一九四七年计三渠放水后，水量已感不足。四八年夏季亢旱，渠滩曾将冶河水完全坝干，使下游水量不足，浇不成地，而引起上下游群众性的争水纠纷。当时采用了调剂水量，逐渠让水，照顾下游的办法，使大部渠滩免遭旱坏。计三渠四万亩仅浇到三万亩，春浇两水的不足二万亩，其余只浇一水。由于去年天旱及新建渠道尚不巩固，耗费水是较多，致计三渠三万亩地未能浇好。再从冶河修灌溉四万亩的新渠，按近一、二年水量情形，势必影响现有渠道之灌溉。
    （二）从全面发展水利着眼，开新渠不如引长加宽旧渠，节省水量，减少工费为宜。计三、源泉两渠干长皆三十余里，渠尾已伸向获鹿平原。开新渠因导水路较长，建筑费较大；源泉渠每亩需费小米已百斤以上，计三渠已超过六十斤，东焦等村计划之新渠干长四十里，估计每亩至少需负担二大斗米。如使源泉、计三两渠继续发展，省工省力，较开新渠事半功倍。再者如多开渠口，使取水路的总长加大，消耗水量，降低灌溉效力是难免的。冶河现有渠道，解决水量的基本办法，必须统一取水，按亩平分。但工程浩大，需要长期筹划。如果不顾及到这一点，再开新渠，只有影响现有之水利，引起更多之纠纷。同时东焦十三村，除东焦、牛山二村外，其他十一村，以继续引长加宽源泉渠，均能灌溉。但源泉现因水量尚不充足，工程尚不巩固，负担问题尚需清理，三五年内不能引长加宽。如果上述问题获得解决后，可有步骤的有计划的加宽引长，逐步达到扩大灌溉面积之目的。
    （三）我们深刻接受几年来兴修大渠的教训。四专在滹沱河兴修灵正渠，在沙河兴修荣臻渠，经过四年至六年的努力，大部工程已告完成，但均因开始时对水量估计不足，工程计划只从主观愿望出发，要求庞大，结果现在只得缩小浇地范围，致使群众不满（灵正渠原计划受益五十村，浇地一千二百顷，现已缩至二十三村，争取将六百顷地在三两年内才能浇好）。冶河流域之计三渠同样存在这种情况，东焦计划之新渠，应深刻考虑已有经验教训，不应冒然兴修。本专署这一意见，当时曾与北岳行署农林厅水利科长共同商讨；八月底专区召开合作会议结束时，又曾与获鹿实业科长面谈，由获鹿转告东焦等村：此渠现时不能兴修。但十二月二十四日阅读贵报后，了解了群众还没有得到政府的答复，并且希望政府领导开渠，甚至因此渠开不成而影响到生产情绪，我们深刻检讨，这是工作上的不深入，没有把群众迫切需要的事情到群众中去作很好的商量，及说明情况，进行解释，仍使群众急切等待，这是我们工作上一种官僚主义作风的表现。我们见到报纸后，即派人到东焦一带召集上游五村群众作进一步了解，东焦、牛山二村实因均系旱地菜种不上，吃水亦有很大困难，要求开渠…………。
