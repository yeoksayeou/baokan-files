[Jiaozuo News] Since liberation, the small coal mine in Dongwangfeng Village, Lifeng District, Jiaozuo, has been restored under the management of the people themselves. The daily coal output is now 50 tons, double the previous output. All 299 households in the village have shares. The number of workers working underground has increased to 180, with 75 winch operators, 35 general workers, and 24 staff members, totaling 314 people, working in shifts day and night. All unemployed workers have returned to work. The villagers have received dividends, alleviating their immediate living difficulties, and production is expanding daily.

This small coal mine has been operating in the village for a long time, but during the two years of Kuomintang rule, only dozens of workers remained, and the monthly coal output was only 17, 18, or 20 tons. Most workers were unemployed, villagers received no dividends on their shares, and living conditions were poor. The main reason was the monopoly by local despotic landlord Jin Sihe and others. It was nominally owned by everyone, but in reality, it was their private operation. Until just before liberation, all work was suspended and the mine was shut down, and the masses were deceived by him. After liberation, the masses understood the Communist Party's policy of restoring and developing industry and commerce. The village cadres and the masses took the lead in connecting with each other. During the meeting and discussion, everyone unanimously believed that running this mine well could take care of the villagers' lives, workers would not be unemployed, they could earn money by burning coal, and sales would be fast. Therefore, under the slogan of "self-management, self-employment, and self-dividend," a manager was immediately elected. Twice, voluntary investments totaled 8,640,000 yuan for 864 shares (10,000 yuan per share). During the share discussion, the method of labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit for labor and capital was stipulated, stipulating that every two workers would count as one share, and grain, furniture, and all things used in the kiln would be priced as shares. After the first dividend distribution, another 327 shares were absorbed. At the same time, it was agreed that each person should not have more than five shares at most, because the kiln workers were limited, which could avoid the stagnation of funds and limit the manipulation of funds.

In terms of dividends, the method of diligent accounting and diligent distribution was adopted. From the second day of the tenth lunar month to the second day of the eleventh lunar month, one month, each share was given a dividend of 13,000 yuan. Operating until the 12th, after a rough calculation, each share could still receive 20,000 yuan. After the dividend distribution, the masses were very happy. Jin Ruying's mother (a poor peasant) said: "When the Kuomintang was in power, there were no profits from shares. When the Communist Party came, I bought two shares and received 26,000 yuan (which could buy five dou of corn at that time). It's enough for us mother and daughter to eat for a month." Jin Siming's wife said: "When I came down from the mountain, the family had nothing left. If I hadn't received this 30,000 yuan dividend, we would have starved." Most of the masses reflected that they would not lack coal to burn or money for salt. Now they have also set up an oil mill, a flour mill, and a grocery store, investing a total of about 4 million yuan, with 19 people working and operating, and production is gradually developing. The villagers and workers who have lived by working in the kiln for years have gained the status of masters, and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high.

　　东王封村群众努力生产
  　合伙开煤窑大家有利
  　一个月每股分红一万三千
    【焦作讯】焦作李封区东王封村有座小煤窑，自从解放后，便在人民自己管理经营下恢复了，现每日出煤五十吨比前出煤产量增多一倍。该村有二百九十九户，全都入有股金，现在下窑工人增加到一百八十个，搅把工人七十五名，杂工卅五名，职员廿四人，共三百一十四人，昼夜轮班，失业工人全部复工。群众分得红利解决了眼前生活困难，生产日渐扩大。该村历来就开着这座小煤窑，但在国民党统治的二年中，工人只剩下几十余人，每月出煤十七、八到廿来吨。大部工人失业，村民入股分不到红利，生活贫困，主要原因是被本村奸霸地主靳四合等垄断，名为大家的，实是他们的私营，直至快解放之前，全部停工倒闭，群众又受了他的骗。解放后，群众了解了共产党恢复与发展工商业的政策后，首由村干和群众串通，开会讨论时，大家一致认为搞好这座窑，可顾全村人生活，工人不失业，烧煤又赚钱，销路也快。遂在“自己经营管理、自己干工、自己分红”的口号下，当即选举了经理，两次自愿投资有八百六十四股（每股一万元）计八百六十四万元，入股上讨论了劳资合作劳资两利的办法，规定工人每二个工顶一股，粮食家具凡窑上用着的东西都作价入股。在第一次分红后，又吸收三百二十七股，同时并议定每人最多不得超过五股，因为窑工有限，可以避免资金停留，限制资金操纵。分红上采取了勤算帐勤分红的办法，他们从阴历十月初二到十一月初二日的一个月，每股即分红一万三千元，经营到十二日，大约计算了一下，每股还可分到两万元。经分红后，群众十分高兴，靳如英娘（贫农）说：“国民党在时入股没得利，共产党来入二股，分了二万六千元（当时可买五斗玉茭），俺娘们俩口可够一月吃。”靳四明老婆说：“下山来，家里给倒算完啦，如不分这三万元红利，就得挨饿。”大部群众反映这下可不缺煤烧，不缺盐钱啦。现在他们又设增油坊一座，粉房一座，杂货铺一座，投入资金共四百来万元，有十九人劳动经营，生产逐渐发展。历年来凭下窑过日子的该村群众工人，获得了主人翁的地位，生产情绪空前高涨。　　　　　（王泽民、刘兴台、周波）
