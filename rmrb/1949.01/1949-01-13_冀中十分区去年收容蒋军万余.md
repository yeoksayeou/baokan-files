Xinhua News Agency, North China, 8th. The Southern Hebei 10th Military District (the Tianjin-Baoding triangle area) has accepted over ten thousand KMT and Fu Zuoyi troops who have fled or surrendered in the past year. Enemy troops began to desert sporadically in March and April of last year, and this trend further developed after May. The Li Donghai platoon of Wang Fenggang's bandit shock troops and others surrendered collectively one after another. Among the soldiers of Wang's 3rd Regiment, a folk rhyme was popular: "Two full meals a day, eat and fall down, run when there's trouble, surrender if you can't run, surrendering won't kill you." According to incomplete statistics, from January to December 10th of last year, the entire military district accepted a total of 9,995 fleeing bandit soldiers and 169 soldiers who surrendered with their weapons.

    【新华社华北八日电】冀中十分区（平津保三角地带），一年来收容逃亡及投降的蒋傅军官兵达一万余名。去年三、四月间敌军就开始零星的逃跑，到五月以后进一步发展，王凤岗匪部突击队李东海班等先后集体投诚。王匪三团的士兵中，流行一首歌谣：“一天两饱，吃了一倒，有情况就跑，跑不了缴枪，缴枪死不了。”据不完全统计，从去年一月到十二月十日，全分区共收容匪军逃亡官兵九千九百九十五名，携械投诚的官兵一百六十九名。
