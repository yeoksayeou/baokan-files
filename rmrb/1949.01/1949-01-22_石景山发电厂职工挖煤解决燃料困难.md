　　Xinhua News Agency, Pingjiao, 17th: Workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant in the western suburbs of Beiping are actively finding ways to initially solve the plant's temporary fuel shortage. Overcoming this difficulty ensures the supply of electricity to the industrial area in the near suburbs of Beiping and to citizens in the city. The plant's coal supply relied on transportation from the Kailuan Coal Mine. Now, because Beiping has not yet been liberated, coal cannot be transported, and the existing coal reserves are about to be exhausted, estimated to last only ten days. In order to solve this difficulty, the Shijingshan receiving personnel of the Beiping Military Control Commission's Western Suburbs Branch mobilized all workers to dig up the coal that had been stored around the factory over the years. The coal digging work was originally scheduled to start on the 8th, but 26 workers from the General Affairs Section of the plant started on the afternoon of the 7th, digging 30 carts of coal in half a day. On the morning of the 8th, workers from all units of the plant participated in the coal digging, braving the heavy wind and sand in the severe cold of minus 14 degrees Celsius, and the general efficiency was very high. According to the personnel in charge of coal digging: it was originally estimated that the amount of stored coal would be at most 1,000 tons, but based on the situation on the 8th, the amount of stored coal will exceed this estimate, which can solve the needs for a month. At the same time, the plant's workers have also come up with many ways to save fuel, adjusting and using various generators, which not only saves 50 tons of bituminous coal per day, but also increases the power supply by 40% compared to before.
　　
     Xinhua News Agency, Pingjiao, 18th: The preparatory office of the workers' consumer cooperative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has initially solved the difficulty of supplying some daily necessities for the workers. On New Year's Day this year, the cooperative distributed more than 3,000 catties of pork, 30,000 catties of cabbage, and 6,000 catties of salt, allowing more than 3,000 workers of the plant to buy an average of one catty of pork, ten catties of cabbage, and two catties of salt at a price 50% lower than the market price, and happily celebrate the first New Year after liberation. In order to take care of the economic difficulties of the plant's workers, the cooperative distributed daily necessities on credit, and the workers will repay the debt when they receive their wages. The preparatory office of the cooperative was established on the 30th of last month, and the local people's government lent 20,000 catties of millet, 8,000 catties of corn, and 60,000 yuan of people's currency (equivalent to 6,000 catties of millet) as capital. In addition to operating daily consumption supplies, it is also preparing to supply the workers of the plant with the necessities for the Lunar New Year.

　　石景山发电厂职工挖煤解决燃料困难
    【新华社平郊十七日电】北平西郊石景山发电所职工积极设法，初步解决了该厂暂时的燃料不足的困难。这一困难的克服，保证了北平近郊工业区及城内市民用电的供应。该厂用煤向赖自开滦煤矿运来，现因北平尚未解放，用煤无法运来，存煤亦将用完，估计仅敷十天之用。我北平军事管制委员会西郊分会石景山接收人员为解决这一困难，乃发动全体职工挖掘工厂周围之历年存煤。挖存煤工作原定八日动工，但该厂庶务股二十六位职工于七日下午即开始动手，半天内挖煤三十车。八日晨全厂各单位参加挖煤职工，冒着大风沙，在零下十四度的严寒中开始工作，一般效率甚高。据主持挖煤的人员说：原来估计此项存煤至多一千吨，但据八日一天的情形看，存煤将超过这一估计数，可解决一个月的需要。同时，该厂职工还想出了许多节省燃料的办法，将各式发电机加以调整使用，不仅每日可节省烟煤五十吨，而且供电量较以前还增加了百分之四十。
    【新华社平郊十八日电】石景山钢铁厂的职工消费合作社筹备处已初步解决了职工一部分日用必需品供应的困难。今年元旦日一天内，该社共配售猪肉三千余斤，白菜三万斤，食盐六千斤，使该厂三千余职工平均每人以低于市价百分之五十的价格买到一斤猪肉、十斤白菜、二斤食盐，欢度了解放后的第一个新年。为照顾该厂职工经济困难，该社此次一律以记帐方式配售日用必需品，俟工人们领下工资时还帐。该合作社筹备处系于上月三十日成立，由当地人民政府借与小米两万斤、玉蜀黍八千斤、人民券六万元（折合小米六千斤）作资金。现除经营日常消费供应外，正准备供应该厂职工过旧历年的需用品。
