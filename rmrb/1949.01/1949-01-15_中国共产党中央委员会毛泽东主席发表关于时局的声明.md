Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Today, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the following statement on the current situation:

　　Since July 1946, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government, with the help of American imperialists, has violated the will of the people, torn up the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war, which has lasted for two and a half years. In these two and a half years of war, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government, in defiance of public opinion, convened a bogus National Assembly, promulgated a bogus constitution, elected a bogus president, issued a so-called "Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion" bogus order, sold a large number of national rights to the American government, obtained billions of dollars in foreign debt from the American government, enticed the American government's navy and air force to occupy China's territory, territorial waters, and airspace, signed a large number of treasonous treaties with the American government, accepted the participation of the American military advisory group in China's civil war, and obtained from the American government a large number of aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, light artillery, machine guns, rifles, shells, bullets and other military supplies as weapons to slaughter the Chinese people. On the basis of the above-mentioned reactionary and treasonous domestic and foreign policies, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government directed its millions of troops to launch a brutal offensive against the Chinese People's Liberation Areas and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. All People's Liberation Areas in East China, Central Plains, North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China have been ravaged by Kuomintang troops. The central cities of the liberated areas, such as Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, Huaiyin, Heze, Daming, Linyi, Yantai, Chengde, Siping, Changchun, Jilin, and Andong, have all been occupied by bandit troops. Wherever the bandit troops went, they killed the people, raped women, burned villages, and plundered property, stopping at nothing. In the ruling areas of the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants were forced to provide grain, pay taxes, and contribute labor, squeezing them dry to supply their so-called "suppression of rebellion." The reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government abolished all the people's freedoms and rights, suppressed all democratic parties and people's organizations, causing them to lose their legal status; suppressed the just movements of young students against civil war, famine, persecution, American interference in China's internal affairs, and support for Japanese aggression; abused the issuance of bogus legal tender and bogus gold yuan coupons to destroy the people's economic life, plunging the broad masses of the people into bankruptcy; and used various methods of extortion to concentrate the country's greatest wealth in the bureaucratic capital system headed by the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. In short, the domestic war waged by the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government on the basis of its reactionary and treasonous domestic and foreign policies has plunged the people of the whole country into dire straits. The reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government cannot escape its full responsibility. In contrast to the Kuomintang, since the Japanese surrender, the Communist Party of China has made every effort to demand that the Kuomintang government prevent and stop the civil war and implement domestic peace. Based on this policy, the Communist Party of China has persisted in its struggle, and with the support of the people of the whole country, first obtained the signing of the Summary of Talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in October 1945. In January 1946, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and in cooperation with various democratic parties, the Kuomintang was forced to sign a joint resolution at the Political Consultative Conference. Since then, the Communist Party of China, together with various democratic parties and people's organizations, has struggled to maintain these agreements and resolutions. But unfortunately, all these actions to maintain domestic peace and the people's democratic rights were not respected by the reactionary Kuomintang government; on the contrary, they were considered weak and unworthy of consideration. The reactionary Kuomintang government believed that the people could be deceived, that the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference could be torn up at will, that the People's Liberation Army was not worth a blow, that their millions of troops could run rampant throughout the country, and that the American government's assistance to them was infinitely powerful. With all this, the reactionary Kuomintang government dared to violate the will of the people of the whole country and launched a counter-revolutionary war. Under these circumstances, the Communist Party of China had no choice but to resolutely rise up against the reactionary policies of the Kuomintang government and fight to defend the independence of the country and the democratic rights of the people. Since July 1946, the Communist Party of China has led the heroic People's Liberation Army to resist the offensive of the 4.3 million troops of the reactionary Kuomintang government, and then turned itself into a counter-offensive, thereby recovering all the lost land in the liberated areas and liberating the major cities of Shijiazhuang, Luoyang, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Shenyang, Xuzhou and Tangshan. The Chinese People's Liberation Army overcame unparalleled difficulties, strengthened itself, and equipped itself with a large number of weapons and equipment sent by the American government to the Kuomintang government. In the process of two and a half years, it annihilated the main military forces and all the elite divisions of the reactionary Kuomintang government. Now, the People's Liberation Army is superior to the remaining military forces of the reactionary Kuomintang government in terms of numbers, morale and equipment. Only now have the Chinese people begun to breathe a sigh of relief. Now, the situation is very clear: as long as the People's Liberation Army launches a few more major attacks on the remaining Kuomintang troops, the entire reactionary ruling structure of the Kuomintang will collapse and be annihilated. Now, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government's policy of launching a civil war has reaped its own consequences: it is deserted by its followers and has reached a state of being unable to maintain itself. Under this situation, in order to maintain the remaining strength of the Kuomintang government, gain time to breathe, and then make a comeback to extinguish the revolutionary forces, Chiang Kai-shek, the number one war criminal, the leader of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and the bogus president of the Nanjing government, proposed on January 1 this year a suggestion that he was willing to conduct peace talks with the Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China believes that this proposal is hypocritical. This is because Chiang Kai-shek, in his proposal, put forward conditions that the preservation of the bogus constitution, the bogus legal system, and the reactionary army, etc., were not acceptable to the people of the whole country as the basis for peace talks. These are conditions for continuing the war, not conditions for peace. In the past ten days, the people of the whole country have shown their will. The people yearn for peace at an early date, but do not approve of the so-called peace of the war criminals, and do not approve of their reactionary conditions. On the basis of this public opinion, the Communist Party of China declares: Although the Chinese People's Liberation Army has sufficient strength and sufficient reason, and is confident that it can completely eliminate the remaining military forces of the reactionary Kuomintang government within a short period of time, in order to end the war quickly, achieve real peace, and reduce the suffering of the people, the Communist Party of China is willing to conduct peace talks with the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government and any other Kuomintang local governments and military groups on the basis of the following conditions. These conditions are: (1) Punish war criminals; (2) Abolish the bogus constitution; (3) Abolish the bogus legal system; (4) Reorganize all reactionary troops in accordance with democratic principles; (5) Confiscate bureaucratic capital; (6) Reform the land system; (7) Abolish treasonous treaties; (8) Convene a political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries, establish a democratic coalition government, and take over all the powers of the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government and its subordinate governments at all levels. The Communist Party of China believes that the above conditions reflect the public opinion of the people of the whole country, and only the peace established under the above conditions is a true democratic peace. If the people in the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government are willing to achieve a true democratic peace, rather than a false and reactionary peace, then they should abandon their reactionary conditions and recognize the eight conditions put forward by the Communist Party of China as the basis for both sides to engage in peace talks. Otherwise, it will prove that their so-called peace is just a trick. We hope that the people of the whole country, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations will rise up to strive for true democratic peace and oppose false and reactionary peace. Patriotic people in the Nanjing Kuomintang government system should also support such peace proposals. All commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, pay attention: Before the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government accepts and implements true democratic peace, you should not slacken your combat efforts in the slightest. Any reactionaries who dare to resist must be resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilated.

　　中国共产党中央委员会毛泽东主席发表关于时局的声明
    【新华社陕北十四日电】本日，中国共产党中央委员会毛泽东主席发表关于时局的声明如下：
    自一九四六年七月，南京国民党反动政府在美国帝国主义者的帮助之下，违背人民意志，撕毁停战协定和政治协商会议的决议，发动全国规模的反革命的国内战争以来，业已两年半了。在这两年半的战争中，南京国民党反动政府违背民意，召集了伪国民大会，颁布了伪宪法，选举了伪总统，颁布了所谓“动员戡乱”的伪令，出卖了大批的国家权利给美国政府，从美国政府获得了数十亿美元的外债，勾引了美国政府的海军和空军占据中国的领土、领海、领空，和美国政府订立了大批的卖国条约，接受美国军事顾问团参加中国的内战，从美国政府获得了大批的飞机、坦克、重炮、轻炮、机关枪、步枪、炮弹、子弹及其他军用物资以为屠杀中国人民的武器。南京国民党反动政府在上述各项反动的卖国的内政外交基本政策的基础上，指挥它的数百万军队，向着中国人民解放区和中国人民解放军举行了残酷的进攻。所有华东、中原、华北、西北、东北各人民解放区无一不受到国民党军队的蹂躏。解放区的中心城市延安、张家口、淮阴、菏泽、大名、临沂、烟台、承德、四平、长春、吉林、安东等地，均曾被匪军占领。匪军所至，杀戮人民，奸淫妇女，焚毁村庄，掠夺财物，无所不用其极。在南京国民党反动政府的统治区域，则压迫工农兵学商各界广大人民群众出粮、出税、出力，敲骨吸髓，以供其所谓“戡乱剿匪”之用。南京国民党反动政府取消人民的一切自由权利，压迫一切民主党派及人民团体使其丧失合法地位；压迫青年学生们的反内战、反饥饿、反迫害、反美国干涉中国内政及扶植日本侵略势力等项正义的运动；滥发伪法币及伪金圆券破坏人民的经济生活，使广大人民陷于破产的地位；用各种搜括的方法，使国家最大的财富集中于蒋宋孔陈四大家族为首的官僚资本系统。总之，南京国民党反动政府，在其反动的卖国的内政外交基本政策的基础之上所举行的国内战争，业已陷全国人民于水深火热之中，南京国民党反动政府决不能逃脱自己应负的全部责任。和国民党相反，中国共产党自从日本投降以后，即尽一切努力向国民党政府要求防止及停止国内战争，实行国内和平。中国共产党根据此种方针，坚持地奋斗，在全国人民的赞助之下，首先获得了一九四五年十月国共两党会谈纪要的签订。在一九四六年一月，又签订了国共两党的停战协定，并与各民主党派协作，在政治协商会议上迫使国民党签订了共同的决议。自此以后，中国共产党即和各民主党派各人民团体一道为维护这些协定和决议而奋斗。但是可惜，所有这些维护国内和平及人民民主权利的行为，均不被国民党反动政府所尊重；相反地，是被认为软弱和不值一顾的。国民党反动政府认为人民可欺，认为停战协定和政治协商会议的决议可以随意撕毁，认为人民解放军不值一击，认为他们的数百万军队可以横行全国，认为美国政府对于他们的援助是力大无穷的。以此种种，国民党反动政府就敢于违背全国人民的意志，发动了反革命战争。在此种情况下，中国共产党不得不坚决地起来反对国民党政府的反动政策，为着保卫国家的独立和人民的民主权利而奋斗。自一九四六年七月起，中国共产党领导了英勇的人民解放军抵抗了国民党反动政府的四百三十万军队的进攻，然后又使自己转入了反攻，从而收复了解放区的一切失地，并解放了石家庄、洛阳、济南、郑州、开封、沈阳、徐州、唐山诸大城市。中国人民解放军克服了无比的困难，壮大了自己，以美国政府送给国民党政府的大批武器装备了自己。在两年半的过程中，歼灭了国民党反动政府的主要军事力量及一切精锐师团。现在，人民解放军无论在数量上士气上和装备上均优于国民党反动政府的歼余军事力量。至此，中国人民才开始吐了一口气。现在，情况已非常明显，只要人民解放军向着残余的国民党军再作若干次重大的攻击，全部国民党反动统治机构即将土崩瓦解，归于消灭。现在，国民党反动政府发动内战的政策，业已自食其果：众叛亲离，已至不能维持的境地。在此种形势下，为着保持国民党政府的残余力量，取得喘息时间，然后卷土重来，扑灭革命力量之目的，中国第一名战争罪犯国民党匪帮首领南京政府伪大总统蒋介石，于今年一月一日，提出了愿意与中国共产党进行和平谈判的建议。中国共产党认为这个建议是虚伪的。这是因为蒋介石在他的建议中提出了保存伪宪法、伪法统及反动军队等项为全国人民所不能同意的条件，以为和平谈判的基础。这是继续战争的条件，不是和平的条件。旬日以来，全国人民业已显示了自己的意志。人民渴望早日获得和平，但是不赞成战争罪犯们的所谓和平，不赞成他们的反动条件。在此种民意基础之上，中国共产党声明：虽然中国人民解放军具有充足力量和充足理由，确有把握在不要很久的时间之内，全部消灭国民党反动政府的残余军事力量，但是为了迅速结束战争，实现真正的和平，减少人民的痛苦，中国共产党愿意与南京国民党反动政府及其他任何国民党地方政府与军事集团在下列条件的基础之上进行和平谈判。这些条件是：（一）惩办战争罪犯；（二）废除伪宪法；（三）废除伪法统；（四）依据民主原则改编一切反动军队；（五）没收官僚资本；（六）改革土地制度；（七）废除卖国条约；（八）召开没有反动分子参加的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，接收南京国民党反动政府及其所属各级政府的一切权力。中国共产党认为，上述各项条件反映了全国人民的公意，只有在上述各项条件之下所建立的和平，才是真正的民主的和平。如果南京国民党反动政府中的人们，愿意实现真正的民主的和平，而不是虚伪的反动的和平，那么，他们就应当放弃其反动的条件，承认中国共产党提出的八个条件，以为双方从事和平谈判的基础。否则，就证明他们的所谓和平，不过是一个骗局。我们希望全国人民，各民主党派，各人民团体，大家起来争取真正的民主的和平，反对虚伪的反动的和平。南京国民党政府系统中的爱国人士，亦应当赞助这样的和平建议。中国人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员同志注意：在南京国民党反动政府接受并实现真正的民主的和平以前，你们丝毫也不应当松懈你们的战斗努力。对于任何敢于反抗的反动派，必须坚决彻底干净全部地歼灭之。
