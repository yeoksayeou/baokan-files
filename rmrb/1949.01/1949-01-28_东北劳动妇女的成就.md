Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 26th: Over the past year, the vast number of women laborers in both rural and urban areas of Northeast China have made significant contributions on the labor front. With the completion of land reform in most areas of Northeast China, rural working women have shifted from participating in the anti-feudal struggle to engaging in the great production movement. In Songjiang Province, 140,000 women participated in agricultural labor such as spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting. According to incomplete statistics from nine districts in Hulan County, Songjiang Province, over 60% of the 15,600 women participated in manure delivery. In Yanji County, Jilin Province, over 79% of the total number of women participated in hoeing. In Heilongjiang Province, the number of women participating in summer weeding accounted for more than 50% of the total number of women, and in some areas even reached 80%, of which one-third also learned to use large hoes for weeding. This province expanded the cultivated area by more than 73,000 hectares this year, and ensured three hoeings and three passes in 80% of the area. Without the active participation of the vast number of women in field labor, it would have been impossible to achieve this result. In addition to participating in agricultural production, women in various regions also generally participated in sideline production. In twelve districts of Yanji County, Jilin Province, more than 20,000 women participated in spinning, weaving, making shoes, braiding straw sandals, and making straw ropes, which solved the difficulties of clothing and pocket money. In Dongguang District of Lindian County, Nenjiang Province, 270 women in eleven villages relied on weaving mats and collecting firewood to exchange for 335,000 catties of grain, enough for 1,100 people to eat for three months. In Harbin City, more than 10,000 women made 300,000 sets of overcoats and 510,000 sets of cotton clothes for the People's Liberation Army after the autumn offensive last year. In Qiqihar City, 6,000 women made more than 400,000 sets of military uniforms in four and a half months. Women in Andong City made 400,000 pairs of military shoes in five and a half months. Because they created wealth for their families and society, the past erroneous ideas among men who belittled women, such as "mares cannot go into battle," began to be corrected. During summer weeding, farmers in many places competed to ask women to hoe the fields. Before the autumn harvest, many districts and villages put forward the tasks that needed women to undertake in advance. Among women, the old view of "marrying a man for food and clothing" is gradually changing to the new view of "whoever can work is glorious," and a large number of labor models have emerged. A total of more than 250 female labor models have emerged in six counties including Zhaodong in Nenjiang Province. In Helan, Yilan, Jixian, and Baoqing counties of Hejiang Province, 643 female labor models emerged in summer weeding alone. In some areas, some working women have joined the Chinese Communist Party.

　　东北劳动妇女的成就
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】去年一年来，东北农村和城市的广大妇女在劳动战线上贡献了很大的力量。随着东北大部分地区土地改革的完成，农村劳动妇女已从参加反封建斗争转入了大生产运动，松江省有十四万妇女参加了春耕、夏锄和秋收等农业劳动。据松江省呼兰县九个区的不完全统计：在一万五千六百个妇女中，参加送粪的占百分之六十以上。吉林省延吉县参加铲地的占妇女总数的百分之七十九强。合江省各地参加夏锄的妇女占妇女总数的百分之五十以上，有的地区甚至达到百分之八十，其中有三分之一并学会了拿大锄铲地。该省今年扩大耕地面积七万三千余垧，并在百分之八十的地区保证三铲三趟，若没有广大妇女的积极参加田间劳动，这种成绩的获得是不可能的。除参加农业生产以外，各地妇女也普遍参加了副业生产。吉林延吉县十二个区内有两万多妇女参加纺织、做鞋、编草鞋、打草绳，解决了穿衣和零用的困难。嫩江林甸县东光区十一个村妇女二百七十人，依靠编席、打柴等换回粮食三十三万五千斤，足供一千一百人三个月的吃粮。哈尔滨市一万多妇女，仅仅在东北人民解放军去年秋季攻势以后，就为解放军赶制了三十万套大衣和五十一万套棉衣。齐齐哈尔市六千名妇女在四个半月中作成军服四十余万套。安东市妇女则在五个半月中作成军鞋四十万双。由于她们为家庭和社会创造了财富，使过去男人中的所谓“骒马（即母马）不能上阵”等轻视妇女的错误思想，开始得到了纠正。夏锄时，许多地方的农民争着叫妇女给铲地。秋收前，许多区村都事先把需要妇女担当的任务提了出来。在妇女中，“嫁汉嫁汉穿衣吃饭”的旧观点，也逐渐在改变为“谁能劳动谁就光荣”的新观点，并且产生了大批劳动模范。嫩江省肇东等六个县共产生二百五十余名女劳动模范。合江省鹤立、依兰、集贤、宝清四个县仅夏锄中就产生了妇女劳动模范六百四十三人。有的地区并有部分劳动妇女参加了中国共产党。
