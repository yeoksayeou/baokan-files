　　Pursuing and Annihilating Fleeing Enemy in Wind and Snow
  　A Scene from the Zhangjiakou Battle
    Yang Jue
    The enemy broke through. Our troops from all directions, in waves, fiercely pursued northward. Soldiers ran and shouted, "Those jackrabbits won't get away!" "Hey! See that? The foot of that mountain ahead is the graveyard of the 105th Army!" "If I capture Yuan Qingrong, I'll earn a merit!"
    Caravans transporting grain and teams of stretcher-bearers marched together with the troops. "Comrades, you're working hard!" "No, you're the ones working hard, hurry and chase them!" Both sides smiled, and the troops moved on.
    The mountain tops all around were filled with black clouds of smoke. The strong smell of gunpowder filled our nostrils. Cannons, machine guns, and grenades roared as one, the valleys vibrated with a constant rumbling. A pack animal driver returning from delivering ammunition told us, "The enemy is scurrying everywhere in the gullies, this shelling is really giving them a hard time!" The reserves on the hilltop watched the battle and cheered, "That's great artillery fire!" The soldiers were excited, "Hurry up! This is where we'll earn our merits!" The troops, like mountain streams, flowed from many gullies, converged together, and rushed north.
    Commanders directed the troops to encircle and intercept the enemy around Nanbeiyingzi. Soldiers climbed the mountain paths in the dark night, crossing one mountain peak after another. The rocks were covered in ice, and one could fall if they weren't careful. They cautiously felt their way upwards, step by step. An artilleryman carrying the gun barrel fainted from exhaustion. The doctor rushed over and gave him two injections. When he woke up, he continued to climb. Sweat soaked through his cotton-padded coat, and mountain winds brought shivers, but comrades encouraged each other: "Hold on! For the sake of wiping out the 105th Army! No complaints! No whining!"
    The sky was so overcast that no stars were visible. People, mountains, and fields were all turning white. The wind whipped snow against our faces, but the soldiers forgot the cold. The machine guns in their hands roared, and bullets whistled. Some people's feet were so frozen that they lost all feeling, falling and unable to get up. After recovering, they continued to fight. The reserves stomped their feet behind, wiping the snow from their guns, waiting for orders to go up.
    Dozens, hundreds of prisoners were escorted back. The liaison section was extremely busy, constantly issuing receipts, registering, finding houses, cooking, and transferring them. After a while, they sent back the puppet deputy regimental commander Wang Dazhi, then the puppet 210th Division Commander Li Siwen, the 11th Cavalry Brigade Commander Hu Fengchun, the 5th Cavalry Brigade… and then the puppet 105th Army Commander Yuan Qingrong. The number of weapons also increased: bullets, rifles, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, 60mm mortars… the piles were getting bigger and bigger, blocking the paths in the courtyard. Outside the village, the trees were tied with warhorses, red, white, and black. Our infantrymen had all become cavalry. More and more prisoners, weapons, and warhorses were constantly being sent back….
    The battle ended at noon on the 24th. Tens of thousands of prisoners were escorted down the road in cars. In the gullies that hadn't been cleared yet, there were enemy corpses, wounded soldiers, dead horses, bullets, rifles, grenades, documents, commendations, Kuomintang membership cards, military caps, blankets, bundles… and teams of American trucks, jeeps, mountain guns, and ammunition vehicles.
    The 105th Army was annihilated, and Zhangjiakou returned to the people. In the skies above this frontier city, there was burst after burst of laughter.

　　风雪里迫歼逃敌
  　张家口战斗的一幕
    杨觉
    敌人突围了。我军四面八方一股一股的队伍，往北猛追下去，战士们跑着直喊：“跑不了他们这群兔羔子！”“嘿！看见了没，前边那山底下就是一○五军的坟墓！”“捉住袁庆荣我也立个功！”
    运粮草的驮子，成群的担架队和部队走在一起。“老乡们你们辛苦了！”“不，你们辛苦了，快追吧！”双方一笑，部队赶过去。
    四外山顶上弥漫了黑云一样的硝烟，强烈的火药气味塞进了鼻孔，炮、机枪、手榴弹响成了一片，山谷震动的呼隆呼隆的响个不停。一个送炮弹回来的驮手告我们：“敌人满山沟里乱钻，这顿炮够他呛的！”山头上的预备队在观战，不住喝采：“这炮打的好！”战士们高兴了：“快走呀！立功就在这会！”部队象山水一样，从好多山沟里出来汇合在一起向北奔流。
    指挥员指挥着部队向南北营子一带迂回堵击，战士们在黑夜里攀登着山道。翻过一个山头又翻过一个山头。石头上结了冰，登不稳就会掉下去，一步一走的小心摸着往上爬，一个炮兵扛着炮身，累的晕过去，医生赶来注射了两针，醒过来又继续往上爬。汗湿透了棉衣，山风吹来一阵阵的打战，同志们互相鼓励着：“坚持呀！为了消灭一○五军！不喊难！不叫苦！”
    天阴的不见星星，人身上山野地都变白了，风卷雪花吹打人脸，但战士们都忘了冷，手里机枪狂叫子弹呼啸。有人脚冻的失了知觉，摔倒了爬不起来，缓过来又继续战斗。预备队在后边直跺脚，擦着枪身上的雪凌，等待命令上去。
    几十个几百个的俘虏押送回来，联络科忙坏了，不住开收条、登记、找房子、作饭、转送。一会送来伪副团长王大治，又送来伪二一○师师长李思温，骑十一旅旅长胡逢春，骑五旅……，送来伪一○五军军长袁庆荣。武器也越来越多，子弹、步枪、轻机、重机、六○炮……眼看着圪堆越来越大，院里走道都给堵住了。村外树上拴满了战马，红的、白的、黑的，我们的步兵都变成了骑兵。后面不断的又送来了俘虏、武器、战马……。
    二十四日晌午战斗结束了，千万的俘虏群顺着汽车路押送下去。还没打扫的山沟里，到处是敌人的尸体、伤号、死马、子弹、步枪、手榴弹、文件、奖状、国民党证、军帽、毯子、包袱………，成队的美国大卡车、吉普车、山炮和弹药车。
    一○五军覆没了，张家口又回到人民手里。在这塞外的城市上空，响起了一阵阵的欢笑。
