[Jidong Telegram] Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, workers in various factories and mines in Tangshan have raised their political consciousness and are actively engaged in production to support the Liberation War. Workers at the Tangshan Railway Locomotive Factory, from the second day after liberation (December 13th) to the end of the year, repaired eight locomotives in just over ten days. They also established and renovated the "New Tangshan No. 1" and "New Tangshan No. 2" locomotives to celebrate their liberation. The entire factory repaired 82 passenger and freight cars and manufactured 2,180 new locomotive parts, including springs, air pumps, water pumps, axle boxes, necks, steel rods, and screws, in just over ten days, equivalent to five months of work under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Twenty-eight new and overhauled machines were also completed. Under the slogan "Vigorously Support the Tianjin-Peiping Front," 49 workers in the factory's car frame section completed the installation of electric stoves and lights in ten passenger cars specifically for wounded soldiers on the front lines in just one day. Workers in the car frame and furnace sections actively rushed to manufacture over 11,200 bridge frames and parts for the Luan River Railway Bridge. They also installed and repaired more than 50 military trucks, howitzers, and recoilless guns for the Northeast People's Liberation Army. Workers in the sand casting group worked for two days and one night without sleep to cast bridge seats for a railway bridge leading to Tianjin, demonstrating a high degree of labor enthusiasm. After the liberation of the Tangshan, Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, and Tangzhuangzi mines of the Kailuan Coal Mine, daily coal production was 6,000 tons, increasing to 9,564 tons by January 3rd. Workers at the Tangshan branch of the Jibei Electric Power Company used to need seven to ten days to repair a boiler, but after liberation, in order not to affect Tangshan's electricity supply, they repaired two boilers in rotation. They began repairing the second boiler on December 24th and completed it on the 27th. The overhaul of the first boiler began on the 28th and was completed on the 31st. The factory is ready to generate electricity at the highest level immediately after the liberation of Tianjin and Peiping to supply electricity to the liberated Tianjin and Peiping. At the New Year's celebration, all employees put forward the resounding slogan: "Save fuel, reduce costs, and supply more and better electricity to all regions, and strive to develop the industry of the liberated areas!"
