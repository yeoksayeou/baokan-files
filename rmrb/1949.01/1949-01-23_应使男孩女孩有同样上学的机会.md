Masses' Appeal

　　Boys and Girls Should Have Equal Opportunities to Attend School
　　Editor:
　　In the Sixth District of She County, Taihang, at the Dourgong Village Primary School, female students Liu Fengxian, Liu Zhuting, and others are all good students who regularly attend school. During a symposium convened with their parents, the suggestion was made that students who have reached the age of sixteen should continue their education. Most of the male students' parents were very happy and said, "Let him continue studying, he won't be able to do anything without an education. If he doesn't study, all his previous efforts will be wasted." However, some female students' parents have some incorrect ideas and don't want their daughters to study, fearing that they will be out of their control. For example, Liu Zhuting's parent, Liu Fengchun, said, "Let Liu Zhuting drop out of school, I have already betrothed her to someone, and we are planning to give her away this year." At the time, I thought their opinions were incorrect, so I did not agree to let her drop out. I said, "You can go back now, I still need to consult the girls' opinions!" Afterwards, I gathered the female students who had reached the age of sixteen at the school to discuss their parents' opinions. Before I could even finish a sentence, they all burst into tears, more heartbroken than if their parents had died, and their crying brought tears to my own eyes. I said, "Don't cry, I am asking for your opinions. As long as you want to study, I won't let you drop out. I understand the reason for your crying, besides being hindered from going to school, isn't it also because you don't have autonomy over your marriage! I will definitely raise this issue with the higher authorities and submit your opinions." My opinion is that girls should have the same opportunities to attend school as boys, and I firmly oppose arranged marriages by parents. Please, editor, reflect this issue to the government and issue a circular to abolish arranged marriages by parents, and stop children from suffering.

　　Editor's Note: The feudal malpractice of valuing men over women, as seen in some parents in Dourgong Village preventing girls over the age of sixteen from attending school and interfering with their freedom of marriage, is still a prevalent issue in our region and should be taken seriously by all localities. Regular and widespread publicity and education should be carried out among the masses to ensure that women and men have equal access to learning opportunities and freedom of marriage.

### 应使男孩女孩有同样上学的机会

专栏：群众呼吁

　　应使男孩女孩有同样上学的机会编辑同志：
    太行涉县第六区陡贡村初级小学校，有女生刘凤先、刘竹廷等，都是经常到校的好学生。这次召集他们家长开座谈会时，动员年满十六岁的学生仍应继续上学，大多数男生家长都很高兴的说：“还叫他念书吧，出了学也做不了什么。不念的话，以前的就白费了。”但有些女生家长，思想上有点不大正确，不想叫女生念书，怕的是不由他管了。如女生家长刘凤春说：“叫刘竹廷出学吧，我早把她许给人家了，今年就说的给人家了。”当时我想他们提的意见不正确，就没有答复叫她出学。我说：“你们回去吧，我还得征求女生意见！”随后我就在学校召集年满十六岁的女学生，谈家长的意见，一句话还没说完，她们都痛哭起来了，比死了她的父母还伤心，哭的我眼也落下泪来了。我说：“你们都不要哭了，我是征求你们意见，只要你们愿意学习，就不叫你们出学。关于你们哭的问题，我也了解，除了上学遭受阻拦以外、还不是为了婚姻不自主吧！我一定向上边与你们提上这个意见”。我的意见应使女孩与男孩有同样上学的机会，坚决反对父母主婚。请编辑同志把这问题向政府反映反映，下一通令，把父母主婚一律作废，不要再叫儿童受熬煎。
  　　　　　　　　　陡贡村教育委员刘书义
    编者按：陡贡村某些家长阻止十六岁以上的女子上学，并干涉其婚姻自由，这种重男轻女的封建恶习，在我区至今仍是一个颇为普遍的问题，应引起各地重视，在群众中进行经常的普遍的宣传教育，使妇女与男子能得到同等学习的机会及婚姻自由。
