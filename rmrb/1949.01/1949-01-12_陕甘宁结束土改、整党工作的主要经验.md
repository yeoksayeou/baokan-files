Since September of last year, the basic areas of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have been conducting trials to conclude land reform and party rectification work. The Secretariat of the Northwest Central Bureau of the CPC recently held two symposiums with the CPC Yan'an Prefectural Committee, the Yan'an County Land Reform and Party Rectification Work Group, and the staff of the Mass Daily to study and analyze the work in various places. The main experiences of success and failure in this stage were pointed out as follows:

(1) Isolation of trial implementation and paternalistic substitution are the main shortcomings in the work. During this period, most of the leading organs above the county level were confined to "typical trial implementation." They were not good at collecting the experiences of typical trial implementation for analysis, summarizing some basic rules to promote overall work. Instead, they treated "typical trial implementation" with empirical methods and carried out trial implementation blindly and in isolation. This made the "typical trial implementation" lose its meaning and slowed down the progress of the entire work and movement. During this time, the secretaries and county heads of several county party committees each led a work group to conduct trials in separate places, without any interaction with each other. Yan'an County's first phase of trial implementation in one township also failed to exchange experiences in a timely manner. The trial implementation in Yilipu Village of Chuankou District was relatively well done, while the trial implementation in Zhujiagou Village had many shortcomings. The two villages were only separated by a mountain ridge, about ten miles apart, but they still worked independently. The leading comrades did not promptly promote the advantages of Yilipu to "correct" the shortcomings of Zhujiagou. Most of the work groups sent by the higher authorities believed that "typical trial implementation" could only be completed by cadres with strong abilities. They did not trust the cadres and peasant masses, and only based their actions on their own plans and ideas. All the work was done by the work group through paternalistic substitution, believing that only "by doing it themselves can they obtain valuable experience." Therefore, the experience gained in the "typical trial implementation" was mostly about how to do the work themselves, rather than how to mobilize district and township cadres and peasant masses to carry out the work. The comrades of the work group forgot that the task assigned to them by the higher authorities was to carry out leadership work and gain leadership experience, so as to continuously improve and cultivate local cadres and mobilize peasant masses based on policies and practical examples, and do all the work well, rather than for the work group to replace the work of local cadres and replace the masses in doing things.

(2) Failure or inability to combine with the current needs of the masses is another major shortcoming in the work during this period. As a result, the masses were not mobilized. When many work groups arrived in districts and townships to start work, they did not or were not good at combining the tasks they wanted to complete ("determining land rights, rectifying the party, building political power, and developing production") with the current needs of the local masses. This made the masses mistakenly believe that the work group was going to complete one thing, while they themselves were eager to complete another. The farmers in Dengjialou Township, Tianjiazhuang District, Suide, urgently needed to solve the problems of cadres embezzling the fruits of struggle and beating and scolding the masses in the past land reform, but the cadres of the work group sent by the Suide CPC Prefectural Committee ignored these issues and subjectively carried out land measurement. The farmers were busy with the autumn harvest, and the work group did not try to understand the land distribution and yield of the farmers from helping with production, but insisted that the farmers put down production to attend meetings. As a result, the farmers felt disgusted and hoped that the work group would leave quickly. Mizhi County's Longzhen District suffered a disaster last year and had a poor harvest this year. The people had an urgent need for winter production, but the work group did not organize and lead them, but started with correcting deviations, evaluating components, and adjusting land. There were also work groups that mechanically divided the work into several stages to complete, such as several days for propaganda and mobilization, several days for land registration, and several days for evaluating components and yields; or they carried out party rectification separately and in isolation from the end of land reform. For example, Yan'an County planned to divide the work from this winter to next spring into four phases, focusing on doing a good job in some areas with key cadres, and then starting to work in another area. As a result, because there were too many phases, the working time for each village was shortened, affecting the depth of the work. This is because the work group did not clearly recognize that the work tasks given by the higher-level party and government were decided after analyzing and studying the needs of the vast majority of the people, and that it had consistency with the specific needs of certain masses, but also a certain degree of difference. For example, the common demand of the peasant masses in the old areas is to promote rural democracy and to change the shortcomings of some party member cadres who forced orders and were selfish and self-interested. This is precisely the concrete content of party rectification. The peasants demand this kind of concrete party rectification, but do not understand the abstract party rectification promoted by the work group, and even do not understand the meaning of the two words "party rectification." For example, not only do the farmers in the old areas where the land reform has not been completed hope to correct deviations, adjust land, and determine land relations; but even the general farmers in the old areas, when welcoming the new agricultural tax, also require the determination of land area and perennial yield; these are originally the concrete content of this winter's land work. In addition, farmers have more prominent and urgent demands in different periods and under different conditions. Cadres must be good at starting with solving these urgent demands, so as to enlighten and educate the masses, connect with their universal demands, and seek solutions.

(3) The policies were not well grasped, and left-right swings occurred in individual regions. For example, in some regions of the Suide sub-district, the components of genuine landlords and rich peasants were wrongly changed, causing landlords and rich peasants to ask the peasants for property and attempt to reclaim land; in handling the problems of wrongly struggling middle peasants, one-sided emphasis was placed on compensating the wrongly struggled households, withdrawing land from poor and hired peasants, and forcing them to demand property, causing the dissatisfaction and panic of poor and hired peasants. In order to adjust land for the displaced migrants, the Yan'an sub-district and some areas of the Yan'an sub-district also infringed upon the interests of middle peasants and even poor peasants. Fortunately, these have been promptly corrected by the local leading organs.

Contrary to the above situation, in all areas where cadres at all levels can connect with reality to mobilize the masses and can correctly grasp the policies, the goals of cultivating cadres, uniting farmers, and developing production have been achieved. The work experience of Yilipu Village, Yan'an County, is the most valuable typical experience. After the work group composed of two cadres from the sub-district and county levels in coordination with two township cadres arrived in Yilipu, they participated in the village's autumn harvest work. From helping the farmers with the autumn harvest, they learned that the village cadres' desire for personal relationships and official airs caused dissatisfaction among most villagers. The work group firmly started with party rectification (the cadres are all party members) and adjusting the burden, and earnestly launched a democratic movement inside and outside the party. Villagers raised 189 issues, which were solved one by one by a mediation team composed of seven activists from the villagers. Even a suspended case that had been reported to the commissioner's office and delayed for three months was reasonably resolved. On the basis of the masses being mobilized, the peasant masses did a good job in land work, grain requisition, returning to the team, and running winter schools, and a warm winter production was launched.

Regarding the above points, the responsible comrades of the Northwest Bureau and the Masses Daily have recently continuously published instructions and comments in the newspaper, calling on all regions to summarize past experiences, overcome shortcomings, and widely carry out this work in the next three and a half months in accordance with the method of wave-like gradual promotion with emphasis mentioned in the Party Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification in the old and semi-old areas, and strive to complete all the work before the spring plowing this year and turn to the mass production movement. Leading organs above the county level should send strong cadres or organize inspection teams to frequently inspect, understand the situation, summarize experiences, and provide specific guidance to the work in various places, and use this to promote and end land reform and party rectification work.

### 陕甘宁结束土改、整党工作的主要经验

　　陕甘宁结束土改、整党工作的主要经验
    陕甘宁边区基本区自去年九月份以来试办的结束土地改革和整党工作行将总结，中共西北中央局秘书处最近曾两次邀集中共延属地委，延安县土改、整党工作组及群众日报编辑部人员座谈，对各地工作进行研究分析，指出这一阶段中成功和失败的主要经验如下：
    （一）孤立试办和包办代替是工作中的主要缺点。这一时期工作中，县以上的领导机关，大多数拘泥于“典型试办”。不善于把典型试办的经验集中起来加以分析，总结出若干基本规律，用来推动全面工作，却用经验主义的方法来对待“典型试办”，而孤立地盲目地进行试办，使“典型试办”失去意义，并使整个工作和运动进展迟缓。这次若干县党的县委书记和县长各人领一个工作组去试办，各在一处，互不相干。延安县第一期试办一个乡，也是没有及时交流经验。川口区一里铺的试办做得比较好，朱家沟的试办缺点很多，两个村子只隔一道山梁，相距十来里路，彼此还是各干各的，领导同志也未及时发扬一里铺的优点，去“纠正朱家沟的缺点。上级派去的工作组大都以为典型试办”只有靠能力很强的干部才能完成工作，他们不相信干部和农民群众，只凭自己的计划和主张办事，全部工作都由工作组包办代替，以为只“有自己亲手去做才能取得宝贵的经验，因此，在典型试办”中所得到的经验大都是如何亲自动手去作工作的经验，而不是发动区乡干部和农民群众来进行工作的经验。工作组同志忘记了上级派他们去工作的任务是为了进行领导工作并取得领导经验，以便不断地根据政策和实际例子提高和培养当地干部和发动农民群众，做好一切工作，而不是要工作组去代替当地干部工作、代替群众做事。
    （二）没有或不善于结合群众当前的需要，是这一时期工作中另一个主要的缺点。因此，群众没有发动起来。不少工作组到达区乡开始工作时，没有或不善于把自己要想完成的任务“确定地权、整党、建政、发展生产”与当地当时群众的需要结合起来，使得群众误认为工作组要完成的是一件事，他们自己急待完成的又是另一件事。绥德田家庄区邓家楼乡农民急切需要解决过去土地改革中干部贪污斗争果实、打骂群众等问题，但绥德中共地委派去的工作组干部却放着这些不管，主观地进行丈量土地。农民正忙于秋收，工作组不从帮助生产中去了解农民土地分配的情况和产量，却硬要农民放下生产来开会，农民因此感到讨厌，盼望工作组快些离开。米脂县龙镇区去年遭灾，今年歉收，人民对冬季生产要求迫切，但工作组不予组织领导，却仍是从纠偏、评成份、调剂土地等作起。还有的工作组，机械地将工作划定若干阶段来完成，如宣传动员几天，登记土地几天，订成份评产量几天；或把整党与结束土地改革分开孤立进行，如延安县拟把今冬至明春的工作分成四期进行，集中主要干部把一部分地区做好，再开始做另一地区的工作，结果由于分期太多，使每一乡村的工作时间缩短，影响工作的深度。这是由于工作组没有明确认识上级党和政府所给予的工作任务是根据最大多数人民的需要分析研究决定出来的，它与一定群众及其具体需要有着一致性，同时也有着一定程度上的差别。比如，老区的农民群众普遍的要求是发扬农村民主，要求改变若干党员干部强迫命令与自私自利的毛病，这就正是整党的具体内容，农民是要求这种具体的整党，而不理解工作组所宣传的抽象的整党，甚至不懂得“整党”两个字的含义。比如，不仅在结束土地改革未完成的老区农民希望纠正偏向，调剂土地，确定土地关系；就是老区一般的农民在欢迎新的农业税时，也要求确定地亩和常年产量；这些，本来也就是今冬土地工作的具体内容，此外农民在不同时期和不同条件下又有更为突出的急迫的要求，干部就要善于从解决这些急迫的要求入手，从而启发教育群众，联系其普遍的要求，并求得解决。
    （三）没有很好地掌握政策，个别地区发生了左右摇摆的现象。如绥德分区个别地区发生错改真正地主、富农的成份，使地主、富农向农民追要财物，企图收回土地；在处理错斗中农问题上，片面强调照顾错斗户的补偿，向贫雇农抽回土地，逼要财物，引起贫雇农的不满与恐慌。延属分区及延属分区的若干地区为给移难民调剂土地，也曾发生侵犯中农甚至侵犯贫农利益的现象。好在这些都已得到当地领导机关的及时纠正。
    与上述情形相反，凡各级干部能联系实际发动群众，并能正确掌握政策的地区，都达到了培养干部、团结农民、发展生产的目的。延安县一里铺村的工作经验是最可贵的典型经验。由分区级和县级两名干部协同乡干部二人组成的工作组到达一里铺后，即参加该村秋收工作，从帮助农民秋收中，了解到村干部要私情、耍官架子引起了多数村民的不满，工作组硬从整党（干部都是党员）和调整负担入手，认真展开了党内外的民主运动。村民提出问题达一百八十九件，这些问题由村民中七名积极分子组成的调解小组一一解决，连告到专署拖延三个月没有解决的悬案也得到了合理解决。在群众发动起来的基础上，农民群众把土地工作、征粮、归队、兴办冬学等工作都办好了，并掀起了热烈的冬季生产。
    关于上述各点，西北局负责同志及群众日报近特连续在报上发表指示信件和言论，号召各地总结过去经验克服缺点，在今后三个半月时间内按照党中央老区半老区土改、整党指示中所称采取有重点的波浪式的逐步推广的方法普遍进行此一工作，期于今年春耕前求得全部结束，转入大生产运动。县级以上领导机关应派出坚强干部或组织巡视小组，环绕某一重点，经常巡视，了解情况，总结经验，具体指导各地工作，并借以推动和结束土改与整党工作。
