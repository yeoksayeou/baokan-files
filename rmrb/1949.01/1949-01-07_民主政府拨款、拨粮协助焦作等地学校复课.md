Xinhua News Agency, North China, 12th. Schools in Jiaozuo and other cities in northern Henan, newly recovered in late October, have gradually resumed operations. As of the middle of last month, Jiaozuo, Jixian, Wuzhi, and Huojia had restored three public normal and middle schools and eight private middle schools, with a total of more than 2,000 students. Thirty-two public and private primary schools have been restored, with a total of more than 6,000 students. Under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang in the past, cultural and educational undertakings in these cities had been greatly devastated. For example, when Jiaozuo City was first liberated after the Japanese surrender, it had one middle school and seven complete primary schools, with more than 2,000 students. However, before this liberation, only four complete primary schools remained, with 1,000 students. The democratic governments of Wuzhi and Huojia counties allocated more than 6,600 catties of grain and 100,000 Jiao banknotes to help solve the financial difficulties of the schools resuming classes. After the liberation of Huojia, teachers and students staying at the schools actively cooperated to level bunkers and fortifications, repair school sites, and notify students outside the school to attend classes. Mr. Li Shenyu, a former professor at Kaifeng University, is also currently participating in school restoration work in Huojia.

　　民主政府拨款、拨粮协助
  　焦作等地学校复课
    【新华社华北十二日电】十月下旬新收复的豫北焦作等城市的学校教育，已逐渐恢复。截至上月中旬止，焦作、汲县、武陟、获嘉各地，已恢复公立师范中学三所，私立中学八所，学生共有两千余人；公私立小学恢复者已有三十二所，学生共有六千余人。上述这些城市在过去国民党匪帮统治下，文化教育事业曾受到极大的摧残。例如，焦作市在日寇投降后为我首次解放时，原有中学一所，完小七所，学生两千余人。但在此次解放前，只剩完小四所，学生一千人。武陟、获嘉两县民主政府，为帮助解决复课学校的经费困难，曾拨借粮食六千六百余斤，冀钞十万元。获嘉解放后，各中小学留校师生，即积极协力平毁碉堡工事，修整校址，并通知校外学生到校上课。原开封大学教授李慎予先生，目前亦在获嘉参加学校恢复工作。
