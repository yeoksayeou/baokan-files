Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 31st: Moscow News: The twelfth plenary session of the Executive Committee of the Soviet Writers' Union, held here from the 15th to the 20th, reflects the new achievements of Soviet literature and art. Literary representatives of all Soviet nationalities participated in the meeting. The plenary session was presided over by Fadeyev, Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union. The plenary session successively heard reports from Deputy Secretary-General of the Union, Simonov (author of "Russian Question" and "Days and Nights"), and Secretary Gurbatov (author of "The Unvanquished"), as well as writers from various nationalities, on the literature, drama, and film of the Armenian, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Kazakh Republics. All the reports reflected the general upsurge in the literature of all Soviet nationalities. The outstanding works of various forms produced in the recent period mentioned in these reports are all themed on depicting and praising the heroic struggle and happy life of the Soviet people. This includes the heroic fighting of the Soviet people in the Patriotic War. Those soldiers and guerrillas who have been tempered by the flames of war have now become leading figures, leading factories and collective farms, and becoming fighters on the production front. Many new works describe the active labor and happy lives of collective farm peasants, and some new works also describe how Soviet citizens returning from abroad enthusiastically participate in the life of the Soviet motherland. Still other new works describe the growth of the new character of the Soviet people. For example, writers from the Latvian Republic, which only joined the Soviet Union in 1940, have created many such works, depicting the development of the new character of the people under the new socialist system, and the awakened attitude of the people towards labor.

　　In recent years, Soviet writers have created a number of meaningful dramas, which are now leading the struggle of progressive performing arts not only in the Soviet Union but also abroad. Soviet films are shown all over the world, telling all mankind the true situation of socialist countries and the Soviet people.

　　Although Soviet literature and art have already achieved such achievements, the plenary session still used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to seek further improvement in its work. In the discussion of literary works, there will be many warm and sharp criticisms, which shows that Soviet writers are willing to help each other in their creative work. When discussing scripts and film scripts, the central point is that Soviet writers must make more arduous efforts to bring their work to a new and higher level.

　　The conference was attended by Czech writer Dida, Bulgarian writer Sloyanov, and Brazilian writer Amado. This plenary session left a deep impression on them. They said that they had never seen such an enthusiastic and fruitful meeting.

　　苏联文学艺术获得新成就
  　各民族文学显示普遍高涨
    苏联作家联盟执委会举行第十二次全会
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】莫斯科讯：自十五日至二十日在此间举行的苏联作家联盟执委会第十二次全会，反映出苏联文学艺术的新成就。苏联各民族的文学代表都参加了这个会议。全会由苏联作家联盟总书记法捷耶夫主持。全会先后听取了联盟副总书记西蒙诺夫（“俄罗斯问题”及“日日夜夜”的作者）及书记郭尔巴托夫（“宁死不屈”的作者）等各民族的作家关于亚美尼亚、立陶宛、拉脱维亚、哈萨克等共和国的文学、戏剧、电影的报告。所有的报告都反映出苏联各民族文学的普遍高涨。在这些报告中所述及的新近时期中所产生的各种形式的优秀作品，主题都是描写和赞美苏维埃人民英勇的斗争和幸福的生活的。其中包括苏维埃人民在爱国战争中英勇战斗的情形。那些经过战火洗礼的战士与游击队员，现已成为领导人物，领导着工厂与集体农场，成为生产战线上的战士。很多新作品是描写集体农场农民的积极劳动和他们的美满生活的，也有些新作描写从国外回国的苏联公民，怎样热情地参加苏维埃祖国的生活。另有一些新作则描写苏维埃人民之新性格的成长，例如在一九四○年方始加入苏联的拉脱维亚共和国的作家们，就创作了许多这样的作品，描写在新的社会主义制度下，人民新性格的发展，及人民对劳动所怀抱的觉醒的态度。
    最近数年中，苏联作家已创造了若干有意义的戏剧，现在不仅在苏联、而且还在国外领导着进步的表演艺术的斗争。苏联电影在全世界放映着，把社会主义国家和苏维埃人民的真实情况告诉全人类。
    虽然苏联文学艺术已经有了这样的成就，但全会仍运用批评与自我批评的武器，以求工作的进一步提高。在讨论文学作品时，会有许多热烈的尖锐的批评，这说明苏联作家在他们的创造性工作中，愿意彼此互相帮助。讨论剧本和电影脚本时，其中心论点则是：苏联作家必须作更刻苦的努力，使工作达到新的更高的水平。
    出席大会的有捷作家狄达、保作家斯洛扬诺夫及巴西作家阿梅杜等。这次全会给他们的印象极深。他们说，他们从未见过这样热情及结果这样完满的会议。
