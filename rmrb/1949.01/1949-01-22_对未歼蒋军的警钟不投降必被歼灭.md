A Warning Bell for Chiang's Undestroyed Troops: Those Who Do Not Surrender Will Be Annihilated

The spokesperson, talking about the general offensive that began on the 6th, said: "This great annihilation battle, from the start of the attack to the final resolution of the fighting, only lasted four days and nights, and over 100,000 enemy troops were completely wiped out, averaging 40,000 to 50,000 enemies eliminated each day. So many enemies were annihilated so quickly, just like a snowball falling into boiling water. Our army's resolute, rapid, decisive, and thorough annihilation of a large number of enemies is the most significant characteristic of this annihilation battle. Among the 300,000 enemy troops annihilated before and after the destruction of Du Yuming's forces, were Qiu Qingquan's Second Army Corps, a direct line of Chiang Kai-shek's elite troops, the last so-called 'ace army' of the Fifth Army (the New First Army, New Sixth Army, 74th Army, Fifth Army, and 18th Army were known as the five main forces of Chiang Kai-shek's army) after the destruction of Huang Wei's 18th Army, and the only remaining tank regiment under the command of Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Wei-kuo. These many troops were all equipped with American weaponry, trained by the American military advisory group, favored by American imperialists and trusted by Chiang Kai-shek's cadres, and personally commanded by Du Yuming, a famous senior general of the Kuomintang, and were engaged in a decisive battle on the main southern front of the Kuomintang bandits—the Xuzhou battlefield. As a result of the decisive battle, these troops were all wiped out, and even Du Yuming himself was captured alive by our army. Du Yuming's defeat, along with the defeats of Huang Baitao and Huang Wei, and the defeats in Jinzhou, Changchun, Liaoxi, Shenyang, Zhangjiakou, and Tianjin on the northern front, are equivalent to Chiang Kai-shek losing the most important capital of the civil war. The truth that the Kuomintang reactionaries are about to perish has been seen by many senior generals and countless officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, who are unwilling to enter the grave with the Kuomintang ruling clique. Therefore, in the first and second stages of the Huaihai Campaign, He Jifeng, Zhang Kexia, and Liao Yunzhou led their troops in uprisings, and Sun Liangcheng, Huang Zihua, and Zhao Biguang led their troops to lay down their weapons. In the final four days of the great annihilation battle in the third stage of the campaign, the Qiu and Li army corps, direct line troops of Chiang Kai-shek, surrendered to our army by the company, battalion, and division. According to what is already known, the commander of the 45th Division of the Fifth Army led two regiments of officers and soldiers, the deputy commander and chief of staff of the 42nd Division of the Eighth Army led three regiments of officers and soldiers, the headquarters of the Ninth Army led the remnants of the Third Division, the headquarters of the 72nd Army led one regiment, the headquarters of the 32nd Division of the 70th Army led a field artillery battalion (with twelve field guns and three American-style mountain guns) and a logistics battalion, and the commander of the 355th Regiment of the 113th Division of the 12th Army led all the officers and soldiers of the regiment, all of whom laid down their weapons to our army. This is a new change within the enemy, and another characteristic of this great annihilation battle."

The spokesperson continued: "Now we are ringing the alarm bell for all the Kuomintang troops that have not yet been annihilated—they should learn three tragic lessons from the great annihilation battle in the northeast of Yongcheng: First, the People's Liberation Army has gained absolute superiority, and the Kuomintang's forces have reached the end of their rope. Three army corps like Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang, and many special forces, totaling 300,000 men, were all annihilated. Therefore, other Kuomintang troops cannot escape the fate of being annihilated. Second, no matter which Kuomintang army it is, once it is surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, it can no longer break through and escape, and there will be no reinforcements to come to its aid. The only way out is to quickly surrender with their weapons. If they do not surrender quickly, the result will be either starvation and freezing to death or complete annihilation. Third, absolutely do not violate the order of the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army to punish war criminals. If they violate it, they will be severely punished. If those who have already become war criminals can repent and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, they may be able to offset their crimes with their merits; for example, when surrounded, they order a stop to resistance and surrender with their weapons in an orderly manner, etc. On the other hand, if they kill prisoners, release poison gas, or destroy weapons, the People's Liberation Army will resolutely capture them and punish them severely. Huang Wei was captured alive, which is a living example. The top war criminal Du Yuming was captured alive, which is also a living example. They have released poison gas against our army several times, but it has proven that releasing poison gas cannot save them in the slightest."

Speaking about the performance of the People's Liberation Army in combat, the spokesperson said: "In the entire Huaihai Campaign, our army fought continuously for more than two months, maintaining a vigorous morale from beginning to end. In the first and second stages of the campaign, our army pursued the fleeing enemy with a forced march of 120 to 140 li overnight, crossing rivers and wading through water, enduring hunger and cold, regardless of fatigue and hardship. In the third stage of the campaign, our army conducted study in front of the enemy in the freezing weather, launched political offensives, carried out arduous close-range operations, and fought bravely in extreme cold, all demonstrating a high degree of tenacious and persevering spirit and a heroic spirit of hard work. Our army has also made great progress in terms of policies and discipline, combat and military technology, combat command, political work during wartime, staff work, and logistics work. In terms of combat, whether it is blocking or attacking, our army is now capable of conducting modern regular warfare. The great Huaihai Campaign has severely and gloriously tested our army. In this historically significant decisive battle, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the East China Bureau and Central Plains Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Central Plains and East China Field Armies and the Central Plains, East China, and North China local armies fought side by side, and fraternal troops on various battlefields cooperated closely. The millions of people in the three major liberated areas of North China, East China, and Central Plains fully supported us, and our army finally won an unprecedented great victory."

### 对未歼蒋军的警钟不投降必被歼灭

　　对未歼蒋军的警钟不投降必被歼灭
    发言人谈到六日开始的总攻说：“这次大歼灭战，从攻击开始到最后解决战斗，只经过四昼夜，残敌十几万人就全部覆没，平均每天消灭敌人四五万。这么多的敌人，被歼灭得这样快，正好比一个雪球，掉在沸滚的水里一样。我军坚决、迅速、干脆、彻底、全部歼灭了大量敌人，是这次歼灭战最显著的特点。在杜聿明部被歼灭的前后共卅万敌军中，包括蒋介石嫡系精锐兵团邱清泉的第二兵团，蒋匪在黄维兵团十八军被歼后仅存的一支所谓“王牌军”——第五军（按新一军、新六军、七十四军、第五军、十八军被称为蒋匪军之五大主力），还有蒋介石的儿子蒋纬国指挥下仅存的战车团。这许多部队，都是美械装备，经过美国军事顾问团的训练，由美帝国主义者所宠爱的和蒋介石所亲信的干部、国民党著名的高级将领杜聿明亲自指挥，是在国民党匪帮的南线主要战场——徐州战场上进行决战。决战的结果，这些部队都覆没了，连杜聿明本人也被我军活捉了。杜聿明的失败，连同黄百韬、黄维的失败，连同北线锦州、长春、辽西、沈阳、张家口、天津的失败、这就等于蒋介石已经输光了内战最主要的本钱。国民党反动派即将灭亡的真理，连国民党军的不少高级将领和许许多多的官兵们也看到了，他们不愿意跟国民党统治集团一起走进坟墓，因此在淮海战役第一、第二两个阶段中，有何基沣、张克侠、廖运周率部起义，有孙良诚、黄子华、赵壁光率部放下武器，而在战役第三阶段最后四天的大歼灭战中，蒋介石嫡系部队邱、李两兵团，更是成营、成团、成师地向本军放下武器。据已知道的，即有五军四十五师师长率两个团官兵，八军四十二师副师长和参谋长率三个团官兵，九军军部率第三师残部，七十二军军部率一个团，七十军三十二师师部率一个野炮营（带十二门野炮、三门美式山炮）及一个辎重营，以及十二军一一三师三五五团团长率全团官兵，都向本军放下武器。这是敌人内部的新变化，是此次大歼灭战之又一个特点。”
    发言人接着说：“现今我们向一切尚未被歼灭的国民党军队敲起警钟——他们应该从永城东北地区大歼灭战中取得三个悲惨的教训：第一，人民解放军已经取得了绝对优势，而国民党的兵力已到了山穷水尽的时候。象邱清泉、李弥、孙元良这样的三个兵团及许多特种部队共计三十万人在一起，结果都被歼灭了，则国民党的其他军队，更逃脱不了被歼灭的命运。第二，不论是国民党哪一个军队，只要被人民解放军一旦包围了，便再也不能突围逃跑，再也没有一个援兵来增援了，唯一的生路是迅速缴枪投降。如果不迅速投降，结果不是饿死冻死，就是被彻底歼灭。第三，绝对不能违反人民解放军总部所公布的惩处战争罪犯的命令，如果违反了，一定要受到严办。既然已经成了战争罪犯的人，如果能幡然悔改，带罪立功，当可将功折罪；譬如被包围时，下令停止抵抗，有秩序地缴枪投降等等。反之，如果杀害俘虏，施放毒气，破坏武器等，则人民解放军一定要坚决将他拿住严办。黄维被活捉了，是一个活生生的例子，头等战犯杜聿明被活捉了，也是一个活生生的例子。他们曾经几次向我军放毒气，但证明放毒气丝毫不能挽救他们。”
    发言人谈到人民解放军作战表现时，他说：“在全淮海战役中，我军连续作战两个多月，自始至终保持着旺盛的士气。在战役第一、第二两阶段中，我军曾以一夜一百二十里到一百四十里的急行军追击逃敌，渡河涉水，忍饥耐寒，不顾疲劳，不怕艰苦。而在战役第三阶段中，我军在冰天雪地里，进行敌前学习，开展政治攻势，艰苦地进行近迫作业，冒极寒奋战，均表现了高度的顽强坚忍的精神和艰苦奋斗的英雄气概。我军在政策纪律、战斗与军事技术、作战指挥、战时的政治工作、参谋工作与后勤工作等方面，也都有很大的进步。在作战方面无论是阻击或攻坚，我军已能够进行近代化的正规作战。伟大的淮海战役，已经严重地和光荣地考验了我军。在这一次有历史意义的大决战中，由于中共中央毛主席、朱总司令及中共华东局与中原局的正确领导，中原、华东两大野战军和中原、华东、华北地方军并肩作战，各战场兄弟部队协同配合，华北、华东、中原三大解放区千百万人民全力支援，我军终于获得了空前的伟大胜利。”
