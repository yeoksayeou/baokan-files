　　Broad Masses of Women in Rural North China Enthusiastically Engage in Winter Production

　　[Comprehensive report from this newspaper] Women in the vast rural areas of North China are actively involved in winter production. In Yi County, Beiyue District, more than 90,000 spinning wheels are turning day and night. In Renqiu Fourth District, Jizhong, women historically had no habit of production, but now, except for a few villages, women in fifteen villages have generally started to braid straw hat braids. In Xingxian Village, Anping County, which was hit by floods this year, 114 of the 135 able-bodied women in the village participated in scraping soil and boiling niter. A strong middle-aged woman, Zhang Ronggui, scraped the soil and carried it herself. In forty days, she scraped 390 baskets of soil, produced 143 catties of niter, and 240 catties of salt, selling them for more than 20,000 yuan in new currency. In Weijia Hui, Lincheng Fourth District, Taihang, women were not active in spinning and weaving in the past, but now, with the help and mobilization of district cadres, they have become active. Zhao Chunjie, a fifteen-year-old girl, has freely joined five or six sisters to spin thread together every day. They used to spin only one or two taels a day, but now they can spin two or three taels a day, saving lamp oil and chatting and laughing happily. In Dujialou, Qinghe Fourth District, Jinan, women voluntarily combined to dig six cellars for collective spinning, which can accommodate eighty spinning wheels. Women in Suti Village, Yongnian, are launching a spinning and weaving competition. Guo Zhulin's daughter-in-law spins yarn that is even and fine, and weaves cloth that is long and wide, and has received a reward from the county federation of cooperatives. Shi Ximei, an elderly woman in Beishan, Anyang, works hard to spin and weave to overcome the famine, spinning six taels of cotton in one night, which is praised by the whole village, influencing neighboring women to spin thread at night as well. In Xiajin Second District, the seventeen weaving machines in Xiaotun are running day and night, earning more than 10,000 yuan in new currency a month. In the new district of Shouyang and Yuci in the Beiyue District, the social atmosphere among women was very bad under the rule of the "Yan bandit" before liberation, and the folk song "Wear a man, eat a man, marry a man when a man dies" was popular. After liberation, through our education and organization, women have become aware that "it is a shame not to work!" They began to work in the fields, and spinning and weaving became a common phenomenon. Carrying a hoe on the street used to be shameful, but now it is considered "glorious." According to statistics in the county after the autumn harvest, more than 600 women in Guangniu Village have started spinning and weaving. In the past, old men looked down on women, but now they happily say, "Women can do great things!"
