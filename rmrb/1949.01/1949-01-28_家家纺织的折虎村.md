　　The Weaving Village of Zhehu, Where Every Family Spun and Wove
    Liu Heng
    Zhehu Village is a village in the mountain valleys west of Xingtai County, Hebei Province. Although the village isn't very large, its spinning and weaving are quite famous. Out of the village's two hundred and twenty-some households, there are one hundred and ninety-six spinning wheels, sixty-one looms, ten spinning machines, two cotton gins, two cotton carding machines, and even one sock knitting machine. Almost all the women in the village know how to spin and weave. They are also the main force on the production front, working alongside the men to improve their family's economic life and enhance their own social status.

    However, before liberation, Zhehu Village was completely different. At that time, there were neither looms nor cotton carding machines in the village. Although there were a few spinning wheels, they sat idle year after year, covered in dust. The women neither wove nor spun, relying entirely on the grain harvested by the men to exchange for cloth for clothing. At that time, most of the land was in the hands of landlords, and the peasants couldn't even get enough to eat, so where would they find surplus grain to exchange for cloth? As a result, most of the peasants in Zhehu Village wore clothes that were either full of holes or covered with patches upon patches. A quilt would be used for decades; grandmothers in their fifties and sixties were still using the quilts they received as dowry when they got married. In winter, everyone had to burn their stoves like mad. Some families couldn't even afford to heat their stoves, so they had to burn a hot brick when cooking and huddle around it to sleep at night.

    The women of Zhehu Village were always busy, mending and patching, raising children, and grinding grain. Before liberation, peasants had very few animals. Without donkeys to turn the millstone, the women had to lift the millstone themselves and push it, even when heavily pregnant. As a result, babies born in Zhehu Village often had flattened heads or faces. The women were busy, but it didn't pay off because what they did neither added a grain of rice nor an inch of cloth. Everyone thought they were freeloaders. Husbands often beat their wives, saying, "I'm the only one working, while the kids and wife just watch. Supporting you is making me poor!" The wives, of course, felt aggrieved. They said, "We marry men for food and clothing, but now that we're married, we have neither food nor clothing, and we still get beaten and abused!"

    After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army liberated Zhehu Village, and a democratic government was established in the village. The democratic government actively helped the people improve their lives, implemented rent and interest reduction, and established a cooperative in the village. The cooperative helped women develop weaving. The director of the cooperative was very enthusiastic about women's work. He heard that there was a woman in the village named Guo Aini who knew how to weave, so he went to discuss it with her. Guo Aini's family was in Qucun County, and she had learned this craft when she was a girl. She knew the benefits of spinning and weaving. So the two agreed. On the sixth day of the first lunar month in 1942, just after the New Year, Guo Aini braved the wind and traveled dozens of miles to buy a loom. She invited four women who knew how to spin and weave to work together. The five of them only focused on spinning and weaving, and the cooperative took care of all the troubles of buying cotton and selling cloth. Then other women also bought spinning wheels and looms and gathered together to learn weaving.

    In 1943, there was a drought, and the cooperative in Zhehu Village even more vigorously supported weaving to help everyone overcome the disaster. Families with people who knew how to spin and weave suffered relatively little, so those women who didn't know how to spin and weave came to learn. Later, the cooperative also opened a weaving training class and invited Guo Aini to be the teacher. Many young girls and daughters-in-law crowded into the large house of the cooperative every day, spinning and weaving together, challenging each other in competitions, and feeling very motivated.

    Everyone was so enthusiastic about weaving that they couldn't do housework. All the chores such as burning firewood and cooking naturally fell on the shoulders of their mothers and mothers-in-law. At first, some mothers-in-law were dissatisfied, often giving their daughters-in-law cold dishes and saying some cold words: "The Communist Party has come, and the south room has become the north room, and the mother-in-law has become the daughter-in-law!" However, soon, the daughters-in-law brought back cloth and grain from the cooperative. The mothers-in-law not only stopped complaining, but every time their daughters-in-law came home, they would bring them food and cakes. If the daughters-in-law didn't eat, they would force them into their hands. In this way, the trainees in the training class could learn weaving with peace of mind, and everyone learned very quickly.

    It wasn't enough for the trainees in the training class to learn themselves, they also had to teach their mothers, mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and neighbors, which greatly promoted the weaving movement in Zhehu Village. Out of the village's three hundred and eighty-eight women, except for those who were too old or too young, all the women from thirteen to forty-five years old learned how to spin or weave. Before liberation, only twenty people in the village knew how to spin, but now there are two hundred and fifty-nine. Before liberation, only three people in the village knew how to weave, but now there are one hundred and sixty-five. Not only that, Zhehu Village also sent people to other villages to teach spinning and weaving, which also launched the weaving movement in the surrounding twelve villages. The people in these villages all called Zhehu Village "Teacher Village."

    Now, the peasants in Zhehu Village not only have clothes and quilts, but also have surplus cloth. When going to the market, it is no longer the peasants taking grain to exchange for cloth, but the women taking surplus cloth to exchange for livestock and daily necessities. The village has added dozens of donkeys, which can plow the fields and can also replace women in turning the millstone. No one is worried about giving birth to a baby with a flattened head or face.

    The family and social status of the women in Zhehu Village have been greatly improved. Husbands dare not beat their wives, and mothers-in-law dare not abuse their daughters-in-law. Because they have skills and can produce, they have the same rights as men in the village.

　　家家纺织的折虎村
    刘衡
    折虎村是河北邢台县西部山沟里的一个村庄。村子虽不很大，纺线织布却很出名。全村二百二十几户人家，就有纺花车一百九十六辆，织布机六十一架，纺纱机十架，轧花机二架，弹花机二架，还有织袜机一架。村子里的妇女们差不多全都会纺线织布。她们也是生产战线上的主力军，和男人们一道改善了家庭经济生活，并且提高了她们自身的社会地位。
    可是，折虎村在解放以前，却完全不是这样。那时，村里既没有织布机，也没有弹花机，纺花车虽有几辆，却是成年不动弹，满身落上了灰尘。妇女们既不织布，也不纺线，全靠男子们打下的粮食换布穿。那时，田地大部分在地主手里，农民们饭都吃不饱，那里还有多余的粮食去换布？因此，折虎村大多数农民，衣服上不是破的尽是窟窿，就是补钉上面又补补钉。一床被子一盖就是几十年，五、六十岁老太婆盖的还是出嫁时候赔送的被子。冬天里，大家只好拼命地烧炕。有一些人家连炕都烧不起，只好在做饭的时候，烧一块热砖，晚上就搂着这一块热砖睡。
    折虎村的妇女们成天忙得团团转，又要缝破补烂，又要养儿做饭，还要推磨推碾。解放以前，农民的牲口很少，没有毛驴推磨，妇女们只得抱起磨棍子自己推，怀着大肚子也得推。推着推着，生出来的孩子，常常不是头压扁了就是脸压扁了，弄得折虎村不少孩子都是扁头扁脸的。妇女们忙是忙了，可是并不讨好，因为她们忙的那些事，既不能增加一颗粮食，又不能添多一尺布。大家却认为她们是吃闲饭的。丈夫经常打老婆，说：“老子一人干，孩子老婆看，养你们把我养穷了！”当老婆的当然更是满肚子委屈。她们说：“嫁汉嫁汉，为的吃穿，如今嫁了汉，吃没有吃，穿没有穿，还要挨打受气！”
    抗日战争爆发以后，八路军解放了折虎村，村里成立了民主政府。民主政府积极帮助老百姓改善生活，实行了减租减息，又在村里成立了合作社。合作社帮助妇女发展纺织。合作社主任对妇女工作十分热心，他打听到村里有一个妇女叫郭爱妮会纺织，就去和她商量，郭爱妮的娘家在曲周县，她在做姑娘的时候，就学会了这个手艺，她知道纺线织布的好处。因此两个人一说就合。一九四二年阴历正月初六，刚过完年，郭爱妮就冒着大风，跑到几十里之外买回来一架织布机，约了四个会纺会织的妇女一块纺织。她们五个人只管纺，只管织，一切买棉花、卖布等麻烦事，都由合作社替她们办，接着旁的妇女也纷纷买纺花车，买织布机，凑在一块儿学习纺织。
    一九四三年闹旱灾，折虎村的合作社更加鼓起劲来扶植纺织，帮助大家渡过灾荒。凡是会纺会织的人家受的苦都比较小，那些不会纺不会织的妇女也就都来学纺织了。后来合作社又为她们开办了一个纺织训练班，请郭爱妮当教员。许多年轻的姑娘、媳妇，每天挤在合作社的大屋子里，一块纺，一块织，互相挑战比赛，十分有劲。
    大家纺织得那么有劲，就无法做家务事了，一切烧火做饭等杂活自自然然就落在她们的妈妈、婆婆头上。开始有个别的婆婆不满意，常常给媳妇吃冷菜冷饭，还说一些冷言冷语：“共产党来了，南屋变成了北屋，婆婆变成了媳妇！”可是，过不久，媳妇从合作社拿回布来了，拿回粮食来了。婆婆不但不再说怪话，每回媳妇回家，又给媳妇端饭。又给媳妇拿饼子。媳妇不吃，还硬往她手里塞。这样，训练班的学员们都能安安心心地学纺织了，大家学得十分地快。
    训练班的学员们自己学会了还不算，回去还要教自己的妈妈、婆婆、嫂嫂以及隔壁邻居，使得折虎村的纺织运动大大地开展起来。全村三百八十八个妇女，除了老的太老，小的太小之外，从十三岁到四十五岁的妇女，全都学会了纺织或者织布。解放以前，全村会纺线的只有二十人，现在有二百五十九人；解放以前，全村会织布的只有三个人，而现在，则有一百六十五人了。不光是这样，折虎村还派人到外村去教纺线教织布，把周围十二个村子的纺织运动也开展起来。这些村子的人们都把折虎村喊做“老师村”。
    现在，折虎村的农民们不仅有了衣服和被子，而且还有了多余的布匹。赶集的时候，不再是农民们拿着粮食去换布匹，而是妇女们拿着多余的布匹去换牲口和日用品了。全村已经添了几十头毛驴，毛驴可以耕地，还能够代替妇女推磨，谁也不再耽心会生出一个扁头扁脸的孩子来了。
    折虎村的妇女的家庭地位和社会地位都大为提高了。丈夫不敢打老婆了，婆婆也不敢虐待媳妇了。靠了她们有技术，会生产，在村子里她们得到了和男人一样的权利。
