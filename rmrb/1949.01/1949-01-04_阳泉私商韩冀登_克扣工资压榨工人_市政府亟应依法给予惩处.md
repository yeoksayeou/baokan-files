Yangquan Private Merchant Han Jideng
Deducts Wages and Exploits Workers
Municipal Government Should Urgently Punish According to Law

[Our Newspaper] Yangquan City Private Merchant Han Jideng has consistently profited illegally and seriously infringed upon the interests of workers, and must be punished according to law. Before liberation, Han made a fortune by running a puppet cooperative and relying on enemy power. After liberation, he pretended to be enlightened and was even elected as a member of the city's Federation of Industry and Commerce. He reopened the Jindong Jiu Coal Shop and also raised shares to open the Hesheng Guang Pot Factory, Xinming Cinema, and Yisheng Silver Shop, etc. The Hesheng Guang Pot Factory was established in October of the year before last, with the public helping to solve important tools such as furnaces, ladles, and electric motors. Other pot molds and utensils were completely manufactured by workers who worked for more than a month without earning a cent. When operating until May of last year, Han Jideng, in order to monopolize all the property, falsely claimed to be losing money and collectively dismissed the workers. Except for foreman Zhang Baojun who received a small portion of the tools, most of the remaining tools were seized by Han. In July, Han re-recruited a group of workers and borrowed 6,600 jin of millet from the bank to replenish the pot molds and continue to operate. In order to enslave the workers, Han provoked the relationship between the workers and the trade union, saying: "Don't listen to the trade union cadres, don't be exploited by the trade union, it will be easy to handle if the factory gives out money often." He also used "more output, more dividends" to deceive the workers and increase working hours. In October, workers worked as many as sixteen or seventeen hours a day. As a result of such hard work for five months, the output increased from 100 pots per day at the beginning, with 40 finished pots, to 140 Guang pots per day, with 120 finished pots, doubling the amount of finished products. However, the workers not only did not get the benefits of increased production, but even their wages were not paid (the factory only provided food). The factory instead announced a loss of more than 200,000 yuan (new currency, same below), with the intention that if the workers wanted to share dividends, they would have to acknowledge the loss. It also attempted another shutdown. The workers insisted on being paid their wages, but the factory proposed paying only 4.5 yuan per jin of rice; if they demanded to be paid at the market price of 5.4 yuan, the wages for the thirteen days of work stoppage in between would be deducted. Otherwise, they would threaten to close the factory. The workers, fearing unemployment, had to accept this harsh condition. In total, the workers suffered a loss of 144,000 yuan. In addition to illegally exploiting the workers in this way, Han Jideng used various means to obtain large loans from the bank for speculation and profiteering, and deliberately delayed repayment. In September, he attempted to exploit the loophole of "current account overdraft," depositing 10,000 yuan in the bank one day and overdrafting 30,000 the next day. Later, he wanted to overdraft another 30,000, but was sternly rejected by the bank, which instead suffered losses. In total, Han owed the bank more than 111,260 yuan in the name of various shops, and 6,600 jin of millet, which has not been repaid at all. He even insisted that the bank did not provide substantial financial support for the development of industry and commerce, and did everything possible to slander the bank.

Recently, in order to deceive the bank into granting a large loan and to swallow the blood and sweat of the workers of the Hesheng Factory, Han applied to the bank to mortgage the stock of pots worth 125,000 yuan in the Hesheng Factory, which was not his main business, for 100,000 yuan to repay the outstanding loans of his main business, Jindong Jiu Coal Shop. But he also proposed an exchange condition: the bank must first advance 3 million Jichao yuan as freight for the fifteen tons of pots before the pots can be transported. In fact, the sales of coal and iron this year have been very fast, and the prices of coal and iron have been rising continuously. Jindong Jiu is clearly not unable to repay the loan, but is due to illegally hoarding a large amount of coal in preparation for speculation and profiteering. These rogue tactics have been reasonably rejected by the bank.

The Xinming Cinema, operated by Han, is in debt due to poor business. In order to clear the cinema's external debts, Han arbitrarily issued more than 20,000 so-called "movie red tickets" worth 100,000 yuan and distributed them to various merchants and residences. Guangsheng Drugstore alone was issued as many as 35 tickets. The municipal government has begun to pay attention to Han Jideng's illegal extortion and will punish him according to law.

### 阳泉私商韩冀登　克扣工资压榨工人　市政府亟应依法给予惩处

　　阳泉私商韩冀登
  　克扣工资压榨工人
  　市政府亟应依法给予惩处
    【本报讯】阳泉市私商韩冀登一贯违法营利，严重侵犯工人利益，急须依法惩办。韩某于解放前搞伪合作社，依仗敌势发了大财；解放后，假装开明，竟当选该市工商联合会委员。重开晋东久煤栈，并集股开设了和生广锅厂、新明电影院、益生银号等。和生广锅厂系前年十月兴办，由公家帮助解决了炉、杓、电动机等重要工具。其他锅模等用具，完全是工人们白干月余未挣分文制造起来的。经营至去年五月，韩冀登为了独吞全部财产，伪称赔钱，将工人集体解雇。除工头张宝君分得一小部分工具外，其余大部分工具皆被韩某侵占。七月间，韩又重新招收一部分工人，向银行贷小米六千六百斤，补造锅模，继续开工营业。韩某为了奴役工人，曾挑拨工人与工会的关系说：“你们不要听工会干部的话，不要受工会的利用，厂里长下钱，怎么也好办。”又用“多出货多分红”来欺骗工人，增加工时。十月间，工人每日工作达十六、七小时之多。这样苦干了五个月的结果，从开始每天出锅一百口，成品锅四十口，逐渐提高到日产广锅一百四十口，成品一百廿口，成品量增加了两倍。但工人不仅未得到增产的好处，连工资也未领过（厂方只供伙食）。厂方反宣布赔钱二十多万元（新币下同），用意是：工人如要分红就得认赔头。又企图再来一次倒闭。工人坚持照发工资，厂方竟提出每斤米只按四元五折发；如要求按市价五元四，则须扣发中间停工十三天的工资。否则就以停闭工厂来威胁。工人们因害怕失业，只好接受了此种苛刻条件。总计工人共吃了十四万四千元的亏。除这样非法榨取工人以外，韩冀登对银行则使用各种手段，大量贷款，投机倒把，故意拖欠不还。九月间，又企图钻“活存透支”的空子，头一天到银行存款一万元，次日即透支了三万，后又要用透支三万，遭银行严正拒绝，还相反噬。总计韩某以各号名义共拖欠银行款十一万一千二百六十余元，小米六千六百斤，至今分文未还。还硬说银行未以大量资金扶助工商业的发展。对银行极尽污蔑之能事。
    最近韩某为谋骗取银行大量贷款及吞没和生厂工人的血汗，竟申请将非本业的和生厂价值十二万五千元新币的存锅，向银行押借十万元，以偿还其本业晋东久煤栈的欠贷款。但又提出交换条件：要银行首先垫支冀钞三百万元，作为十五吨存锅的运费，才能把锅运来。其实今年煤铁销行很快，煤铁价格不断上升，晋东久显然不是无力还贷，而是由于非法大量囤积大炭，准备投机倒把。这种流氓手段，均经银行合理拒绝。
    韩所经营之新明电影院，因营业不振，欠了外债。韩某为清理影院外债，竟擅自印发二万多张价值十万元新币的所谓“电影红票”，向各商户与住宅发派。广生药庄一家即发派到三十五张之多。韩冀登此种非法的敲诈行为，该市政府已开始注意，并将依法惩办。
