　　【Jizhong 14th Dispatch】The Baoding Military Control Commission recently cracked a case of disrupting social finance, arresting four counterfeit money offenders, including Liang Laoming and Liang Xingmao, and uncovering over 60 million yuan in counterfeit border currency. The main culprit, Niu Hongtai (owner of the Dehexiang Tobacco Shop on Chenghuangmiao Street in Baoding), also surrendered himself after the case was exposed, handing over 15.2 million yuan in counterfeit border currency. According to his confession, he had sent Liang Laoming to Ping in mid-October, and through a Mr. Li, obtained 100 million yuan in counterfeit border currency from the pseudo-North China "Suppression Headquarters," which he used in Xushui and other places. After the liberation of Baoding, he took the opportunity to continue using the counterfeit currency, but was later caught. The Military Control Commission transferred the witnesses and evidence to the city's Provisional People's Court. On the 9th, the court held a trial, and Niu Hongtai and the other five defendants confessed to their crimes. The judge then pronounced the sentence in court, stating that because Niu and the other defendants colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit gang, trafficked and used counterfeit currency, disrupted the liberated area's finances, and harmed the people, in accordance with the joint instructions of the former Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Government and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government regarding the handling of counterfeit currency offenders, the main culprit Niu Hongtai should be sentenced to death. However, considering that Niu surrendered himself, the sentence was reduced to 15 years in prison, with a fine of 200 million yuan in border currency. The other defendants were sentenced to imprisonment from two to ten years, or released on bail, according to the severity of their crimes.
