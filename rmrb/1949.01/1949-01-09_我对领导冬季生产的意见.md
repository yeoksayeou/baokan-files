　　My Opinions on Leading Winter Production
　　Sun Zhen
　　Judging from the winter production plans issued by leadership organs in various regions, this work is generally taken seriously. The Party committees in many regions have clearly proposed to combine winter production with the completion of land reform and party rectification. However, from the results of the past two months of implementation, with the exception of a few regions where certain achievements have been made, most regions have fallen into drift, with little progress. What is the reason? I think there are three issues that should be studied and resolved in a timely manner:

　　The serious phenomenon of neglecting production urgently needs to be inspected and corrected

　　Until recently, some cadres still advocated that "production does not need leadership." Their reasoning is: "The masses don't like us to lead and organize them." They believe that "the masses are more energetic when they do their own thing." (Report from Wei County, Jinnan) Some district and village cadres even think: "Land reform is over, everything is done!" (Review from the Fifth District of Lincheng, Taihang) In seriously disaster-stricken villages in the First District of Yongnian, Jinnan, "the masses have already started to run out of food," but we are still concentrating cadres there to carry out party rectification and complete land reform (Yongnian report, which has begun to be corrected). In Qinghe County, Jinnan, where land reform has basically ended, only 59 out of 276 county and district cadres went to lead production; most of the force was concentrated on party rectification and completion of land reform in a few villages. Later, it was discovered that this was inconsistent with the demands of the broad masses, and only in mid-November did they correct their policy and concentrate their efforts on leading production. Some, in order to carry out other work, "do not let go and allow the masses to produce" (Review from the Fifth District of Yuci), or even restrict the masses' production (Jinnan District Five Prefectural Committee. Now it has instructed all counties: the masses should be allowed to go out to produce). Undoubtedly, with these thoughts existing, any beautiful winter production plan is unlikely to be realized.

　　As far as I know, some leading organs have begun to pay attention to this phenomenon of drift. The Jinnan District Five Prefectural Committee and the Taihang District Five Special Commissioner's Office issued special documents criticizing the phenomenon of neglecting production. The Linxian County Committee of Taihang organized a production inspection team to directly inspect and correct problems in districts and villages, and improve leadership... It should be acknowledged that this approach is absolutely necessary, but simply inspecting and criticizing is not enough; it is also necessary to mobilize everyone to ideologically recognize the importance of organizing winter production. Only by making sufficient preparations this winter can the 1949 production movement be guaranteed. Tasks such as accumulating fertilizer, water conservancy, increasing livestock, and accumulating grain for famine relief cannot be solved by last-minute efforts. Cadres must be taught to genuinely care about and investigate the production difficulties of the masses, and to be determined to solve some of the problems that can be solved. This is the prerequisite for launching this year's winter production movement.

　　Leadership methods still stop at meetings, dissemination, and calls to action

　　As the joint meeting of the Party Branch Committee of Wucheng County, Jinnan District, reviewed: "Because we did not have specific promotion and leadership, production work still mostly remained at the level of calls to action." Generally, "in the production arrangements, the winter production is transmitted to the villages in its entirety without regard to the specific conditions of each district and village, with neither specific plans nor specific requirements." (Review in the instructions of the Taihang District Five Special Commissioner's Office) And after the transmission, "they do not help the masses solve specific difficulties" (Review from the Fifth District of Yuci, Taihang), resulting in "empty shouting." (Suyucun Working Group, First District of Wuxiang, Taihang) Many of our cadres have become accustomed to this bureaucratic leadership method of not investigating, making empty arrangements, not conducting specific organization, and blindly shouting slogans. To correct this leadership method, the Party committees in various regions must set an example from top to bottom; only by doing it themselves can they teach others. The approach of the Tangxian County Committee in the Beiyue District is an example of organizing winter production carefully and by doing it themselves. In the implementation, they did not relax their leadership over production because of many other tasks, but strengthened the regular leadership of production with the county committee as the core. They conducted specific investigations and studies on water conservancy, livestock breeding, and other production undertakings, and made plans that could be implemented, and equipped cadres with professional experience to be specifically responsible for implementation. Taking livestock breeding as an example, the county promptly stipulated measures to reward livestock breeding, and helped the masses organize three livestock farms in Chayezhuang, District One. After specific organization and assistance, by last November, the statistics from only three districts showed that 397 new donkeys and foals were born, nearly completing the county's plan to increase livestock by 400 heads. This means that we must change the method of only making general arrangements for district and village cadres but not doing it ourselves. In the leadership of production, we must advocate organizing special personnel to be responsible for specific undertakings; and the method of everyone combining to promote it. Leadership of production will not be effective if it does not start with specific things. The Wei County Committee of Jinnan said in its review: "At the beginning of leading production, we only focused on stretchers for emergency transportation and organizing cart transportation, and did not seriously study the demands of the masses, resulting in the masses complaining about the district cadres, and the district cadres complaining about the county committee..."

　　The issue of combining winter production with various tasks still needs to be resolved

　　Some county and district cadres are accustomed to the old ways and always prefer to "go it alone," advocating the "stages theory" (Review by the Suyucun Working Group, First District of Wuxiang); believing that only one task can be done in a period of time, and that production and the completion of land reform and other tasks are contradictory. Although this issue has been emphasized and criticized in the instructions and plans of all local Party committees, many cadres do not do well when they go to the villages to work. This is a problem that has not been well resolved for several years. Every year, it is customary to review that production work is "starting strong and finishing weak," and that "the front is tight and the back is loose"; and it is customary not to specifically solve how to combine them well. It seems that this situation has been acquiesced to by some Party committees. Why has it not been well combined? One reason is that there is a muddled concept about leading production, thinking that leading production means "grandly" holding meetings, compiling mutual aid groups, and formulating family and village plans. In the past, Party committees in various regions often regarded this as an achievement of large-scale production. Of course, in the face of the heavy tasks of completing land reform and party rectification, it is indeed very difficult to promote a grand production and transportation effort. However, if we understand the production difficulties and demands of the masses at any time in our work, study and help with various conditions for carrying out production, and discover and commend production models and examples of automatic mutual aid production among the masses, this is entirely possible and should be done. For example, the masses in Dongjiao Village, Huolu, Beiyue District, urgently requested to repair canals for irrigation, and a large number of laborers were idle on the streets all day. If the county and district cadres could promptly investigate and send special personnel to assist, the masses would actively participate themselves. Tazhang Village, Gaoyi, Taihang District, also has successful experience. In the completion of land reform, the working group and village cadres all found special personnel responsible for organizing mass production and solving various difficulties. Each cadre understood the production demands and difficulties of the masses, thus better connecting with the masses, and publicized production models and appropriately criticized lazy people through mass meetings, and introduced the benefits of cooperation and mutual assistance. As a result, the masses invested in more than ten kinds of sideline production, there were no idle people in the whole village, the masses increased their income and were able to overcome the famine, and their morale was high. Therefore, the completion of land reform work was not only not affected, but was completed smoothly. Conversely, the instructions of the Jinnan District Five Prefectural Committee also reviewed: "Villages that carry out the completion of land reform in isolation without taking care of the current production demands of the masses have low morale among the masses and the work is not smooth." Therefore, it is very important to solve the problem of combining land reform, party rectification, and production well. Party committees at all levels, especially those above the county level, must have a clear and affirmative concept of this, and do it themselves to set an example. Only in this way can the correct way to solve this combination problem, which has always been difficult to solve in work for several years, be found.

### 我对领导冬季生产的意见

　　我对领导冬季生产的意见
    孙振
    从各地领导机关所发布的冬季生产计划看，这一工作是一般地被重视了的。不少地区的党委明确提出了要结合冬季生产进行结束土改与整党。但从两月来执行的结果来看，除在少数地区获得了一定的成绩外，大部地区则陷于自流，成绩不大。究竟原因在那里呢？我认为有三个问题应该及时研究解决：
    严重的忽视生产现象急待检查纠正
    直到最近，还有些干部在主张“生产不用领导”。其理由是：“群众不喜欢我们去领导组织。”认为“群众各干各的还起劲。”（冀南魏县报告）更有些区村干部认为：“土改结束了，完事大吉！”（太行临城五区检讨）冀南永年一区的重灾村“群众已经开始没有饭吃了”，我们却还在那里集中干部搞整党、结束土改（永年报告，已开始纠正）。冀南清河县土改已基本结束，但全县二百七十六个县区干部，只有五十九人去领导生产；大部力量集中去少数村整党、结束土改，后发现与广大群众要求不符，才于十一月半改正方针，去集中力量领导生产。更有的为了执行其他工作，“不放手让群众生产”（榆次五区检讨），或竟限制群众生产（冀南区五地委。现已指示各县：应允许群众出门生产）。无疑地，有了这些思想存在，任何漂亮的冬季生产计划，也是难望实现的。
    据我所知，对这种自流现象有些领导机关已经开始注意了。冀南五地委太行五专署发出专门文件，批评轻视生产的现象。太行林县县委组织了生产检查组，直接到区、村进行检查纠正，改进领导………。应该承认这种做法是完全必要的，但仅仅检查、批评是不够的，还必须动员大家从思想上认识组织冬季生产的重要。只有在今冬做了充分的准备工作，一九四九年的生产运动才有保证。举凡积肥、水利、增加牲畜、积粮备荒等工作，都不是临时抱佛脚能解决问题的。必须教会干部去切实的关心与调查群众生产困难，并下决心解决一些能解决的问题，这是开展今年冬季生产运动的前提。
    领导方法还停止在开会、传达、号召
    正如冀南区武城县党的分区委联席会所检讨的：“因为我们没有具体的推动和领导，生产工作还多停留在号召上。”一般的是：“生产布置上，不根据各区、村具体条件，而将冬季生产样样俱全地传达到村，既无具体计划，又无具体要求。”（太行五专署指示中检讨）而在传达之后，“又不帮助群众解决具体困难，”（太行榆次五区检讨）结果形成“空喊一气”。（太行武乡一区苏峪工作组）我们的不少干部已经习惯于这种不调查、空布置，不进行具体组织，盲目空喊的官僚主义的领导方法。要想纠正这种领导方法，就必须由各地党委自上而下的进行示范；只有自己做了，才能教会别人。北岳区唐县县委的作法，就是一种自己动手，精心组织冬季生产的范例；在执行中他们没有因为其他工作很多而放松了对生产的领导，而是以县委为核心加强了对生产的经常领导。对水利、繁殖牲畜等项生产事业，进行了具体的调查研究，并做出可能实行的计划，配备了有专业经验的干部去专门负责执行。从繁殖牲畜一项来说，该县及时规定了奖励繁殖牲畜的办法，并在一区茶叶庄帮助群众组织三个牧畜场，经过具体的组织帮助，到去年十一月，仅三个区的统计就新生小驴小驹三百九十七头，将近完成全县增加牲畜四百头的计划。这就是说我们要必须改正只对区村干部一般布置而自己却不动手去做的方法，在生产的领导上要提倡对专门事业组织专人负责；大家结合推动的方法。领导生产不从具体事情着手是不会有效果的。冀南魏县县委在检讨中说：“开始领导生产只在注意常备担架上、组织大车运输上打主意，没有认真去研究群众要求，结果群众埋怨区干部，区干部埋怨县委………”。
    冬季生产与各种工作的结合问题尚需解决
    有些县区干部习惯过去的老一套，总愿意“单打一”，主张“阶段论”（武乡一区苏峪工作组检讨）；认为一个时期只能干一件工作，生产与结束土改等工作是对立的。这个问题虽在所有各地党委的指示计划中都强调批判了，但干部一到村进行工作，很多是做不好的。这已是几年来没有解决好的问题。每年总是照例检讨生产工作“虎头蛇尾”，“前紧后松”；照例不去具体解决如何才能结合得好。似乎这种情况已被某些党委默认了。为什么未能结合好呢？这里边一个原因是对领导生产存有糊涂观念，以为领导生产就是以“轰轰烈烈”地开会、编互助组、订家庭计划、村计划。过去各地党委也常是以此为大生产的成绩。当然如果在结束土改与整党的繁重任务前面，要去推动一个轰轰烈烈的生产运输确是十分困难的。但是如果我们在工作中随时地了解群众生产上的困难和要求，对开展生产的各种条件，加以研究帮助，发现群众中的生产模范、与自动互助生产的范例加以表扬，这是完全可以做到而且应该做到的。如北岳获鹿东焦村群众迫切要求修渠浇地，大批劳力整日闲散街头，如果县区干部能及时调查派出专人加以协助，则群众自己就会积极起来干的。太行区高邑塔张村亦有成功的经验，在结束土地改革中工作组、村干部皆找出专人负责组织群众生产，解决各种困难，每个干部都了解群众的生产要求与困难，因而更好的联系了群众，并通过群众会议表扬了生产模范，适当的批评了懒汉，介绍了合作互助的好处。结果群众投入十余种副业生产，全村没有闲人，群众增加了收入能渡过灾荒，情绪高涨。因此结束土地改革工作，不但未受影响，而是顺利的完成了。相反的冀南五地委指示中亦检讨到：“凡是不照顾群众当前的生产要求，而孤立地进行结束土改的村庄，群众情绪就低，工作就不顺利。”因此很好地解决土改整党与生产的结合问题是十分重要的。各级党委，特别是县以上党委对此必须有明确肯定的观念，并自己动手，做出示范，只有这样，这个几年来在工作中一向不好解决的结合问题，才能寻找出正确解决的道路。
