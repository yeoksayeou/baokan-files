　　Xuzhou Military Control Commission Issues Order
  　Dissolve Counter-Revolutionary Organizations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, 19th] The plot of counter-revolutionary elements to continue counter-revolutionary activities under the rule of the People's Government by concocting various pretexts has been discovered and suppressed in Xuzhou. The so-called "Democratic Progressive Party" and "New Socialist Revolutionary Party," which suddenly appeared in Xuzhou after liberation, were explicitly ordered to be dissolved by the Xuzhou Military Control Commission of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. The full text of the Xuzhou Military Control Commission's proclamation is as follows: "As our army is about to achieve victory on a national scale, and the Chiang bandits are facing collapse, the Kuomintang and all reactionaries are paying more attention to methods of political struggle, and are attempting to use various political conspiracies to organize various parties and groups in order to conceal the reactionary faces of the Kuomintang and its accomplices, striving to infiltrate the revolutionary camp, undermine the revolutionary forces, and preserve the reactionary forces. All such despicable and shameless means have long been discerned by the people. Recently, illegal organizations called the Democratic Progressive Party and the New Socialist Revolutionary Party have appeared in this city, falsely claiming the name of democracy, carrying out conspiratorial activities, swindling and deceiving, confusing public opinion, and actually hindering social order in this city. They are hereby ordered to be dissolved immediately. In the future, if such illegal organizations are discovered to be carrying out activities in this city, they will be investigated and dealt with without leniency."

　　徐州军管会发布命令
  　解散反革命组织
    【新华社徐州十九日电】反革命分子巧立名目，企图在人民政府统治下继续反革命活动的阴谋，已在徐州发现并受到了镇压。在解放以后的徐州忽然出现的所谓“民主共进党”和“新社会革命党”，被人民解放军华东军区徐州军事管制委员会明令宣布解散。徐州军事管制委员会之布告全文如下：“当兹我军将在全国范围获得胜利，而蒋匪面临崩溃之际，国民党及一切反动派更加重视政治斗争的方法，并企图利用各种政治阴谋，组织各种党派团体，以掩护国民党及其帮凶的反动面目，力求钻入革命阵营，破坏革命势力，保存反动势力。凡此种种卑鄙无耻手段，早为人民所洞悉。本市近出现所谓民主共进党、新社会革命党之非法团体，假冒民主之名，实行阴谋活动，招摇撞骗，淆惑听闻，实妨碍本市社会治安，着令即日解散。今后如再发现此类非法组织在本市内进行活动，定予究办，决不宽贷。”
