【Jinzhong News】The people of Wutai County and other areas in the first district of Jinzhong are deeply concerned about the participating laborers on the front lines and are doing their best to solve various difficulties for the front lines. When they heard that the laborers sometimes could not eat on time due to their tasks, they used white flour, yellow millet flour, and rice flour to make baked pancakes and stir-fried beans boiled in salt water as dry food for the laborers. When the weather turned cold, they urged each other to sew thick cotton clothes. Some poor families could not afford to do so, so everyone automatically raised money to help. Many women were busy sewing shoes and mending socks for their children and husbands. Guodu Temple in Wutai sent each participating laborer a towel. "After all the crops are harvested and the land certificates have been issued, everything is fine at home. You should concentrate on participating in the war, take Taiyuan, and bring back a certificate of honor." Hundreds of letters of condolence, stuffed in condolence bags filled with peanuts, red dates and other foods, or in cotton clothing pockets, were sent to the front lines. According to responsible comrades from six counties including Meng, Wu, Ping, Xin, Ding, and Yang: not counting those sent by the masses themselves and directly from districts and villages, the condolence delegations organized by the counties alone uniformly sent the following to the front lines: 7,824 catties of cabbage, 6,240 catties of pickled vegetables, 570 catties of pork and mutton, 400 catties of white flour, 463 catties of seasonings such as salt, green onions, garlic, peppercorns, and chili peppers, 2,252 catties of fried noodles and cooked beans, 1,654 catties of dry cakes, as well as cigarettes, dry tobacco, matches, cotton clothes, towels, cloth shoes, felt hats, woolen socks, milk, and more than 6,900 yuan (new currency) in silver dollars and award banners. The laborers on the front lines were deeply moved by this spiritual and material encouragement. They said, "If we don't bring back a 'strip' (referring to a certificate of honor), how can we live up to the kindness of the villagers!" Dingxiang, Pinging and other counties held grand commendation meetings after receiving the merit reports from the front lines. More than 8,000 people from four districts participated. The villagers happily said: "This is more glorious than winning the top prize in the imperial examinations during the Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was only himself who was happy, but now everyone is happy." At the meeting, in addition to county and district cadres calling on everyone to actively support the front lines, work hard in production, and learn from the meritorious personnel and models, family members of the meritorious personnel also sent representatives to speak. At the commendation meeting in Zhaojiaying, 84-year-old Yan Sigen said: "I am very happy that my grandson Cun Gui has made meritorious contributions on the front lines. I will also send him a letter and ask him to work even harder." Zhi Mingzhang's wife, the wife of a meritorious person, said: "True glory is to come back after taking Taiyuan. I will write to my man and ask him to add merit upon merit." Under such influence, Wu Rongquan's wife, the wife of a runaway laborer from Chenjiaying, also voluntarily stepped onto the stage and said: "My man ran away, which made the people at home too ashamed to see anyone! I must persuade him to go to the front lines as soon as possible." Qi Buquan, Li Shengyuan, Qi Nengcun, and Liu Jisheng, four escaped laborers from Fanglan Town, also volunteered to rejoin the team on the spot. At the logistics headquarters meeting of the first district, everyone agreed that educating the masses in the form of "commendation meetings" combined with returning to the team was a very effective method.

　　晋中五台等地群众
  　关切前方参战民工
  　都纷纷寄送慰劳品
    【晋中讯】晋中一分区五台等县亲切关心参战民工，竭力为前方解除各种困难。他们听说民工们有时因执行任务，不能按时吃饭，就拿白面、黄米面、米面等烫下饼子，炒下用盐水煮过的豆子，给民工们做干粮。天气冷了，就互相督促赶缝厚棉衣。有个别贫苦家属没法做，大家就自动募款帮助。很多的妇女忙着给他们的子弟、丈夫缝鞋补袜。五台国都殿送参战民工每人一块手巾。“庄稼全收割完后，土地证也发下来了，家里一切都好，你要安心参战，打下太原，带上光荣证再回来。”几百封慰问信，塞在装满花生、红枣等食品的慰问袋里或棉衣口袋里，纷纷寄送前方。据孟、五、平、忻、定、阳等六县负责同志谈：群众自己和从区、村直接送者不算，仅由县组成的慰问团，统一送往前方者有：白菜七千八百二十四斤，咸菜六千二百四十斤，猪羊肉五百七十斤，白面四百斤，盐、葱、蒜、花椒、辣椒等调料四百六十三斤，炒面和熟豆二千二百五十二斤，干饼一千六百五十四斤，及纸烟、旱烟、火柴、棉衣、手巾、布鞋、毡帽、洋袜、牛奶，还有大洋六千九百余元（新币）及奖旗等。前方民工受到这种精神与物质的鼓励，深为感动。他们说：“如不拿上个条条（指光荣证）再回去，怎能对得起乡亲们这样的好心！”定襄、平定等县，接到前方的功臣报单后，即举行隆重的贺功大会，四个区共有八千余群众参加，老乡们喜欢的说：“这比前清时中了状元也荣耀，那时候是他自己高兴，这是大伙都高兴。”会上除县、区干部号召大家积极支前、努力生产并向功臣、模范学习外，功臣家属也推出代表讲话。赵家营庆功大会上，八十四岁的阎四根老汉说：“俺孙子存贵在前线立了功，我真喜欢。我还要给他捎信，叫他更加劲干。”功臣智明章的老婆说：“真正光荣要打下太原再回来。我给我男人写信，叫他再功上加功。”在这样的影响下，陈家营逃跑民工吴荣全的老婆也自动上台说：“我男人偷跑了，闹得家里的人也羞得不敢见人啦！我一定要劝他赶快上前线。”芳兰镇逃亡民工齐补全、李生元、齐能存、刘计生等四人，也当场自报归队。一分区后勤司令部会议上，大家均认为以“贺功会”这种形式教育群众并结合归队，是一种很有效的作法。　　　（青光）
