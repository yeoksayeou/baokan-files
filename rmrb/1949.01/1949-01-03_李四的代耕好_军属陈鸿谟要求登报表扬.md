　　Li Si's Tenant Farming is Excellent
  　Military Family Member Chen Hongmo Requests Publication of Praise
    Comrade Editor:
    On the 8th, while we were doing propaganda work on the street, we met a military family member, Chen Hongmo, over sixty years old, from Zhaishang Village, Ninth District, She County. During our conversation, he requested that we write an article for him to be published in the newspaper. The following is what he said:
    "My name is Chen Hongmo. This year, Li Si has been tenant farming my land very well. Not to mention the large plots, just take the spring repairs to the embankment. In the past, it always took two workdays, and they usually didn't do it well. This year, Si only used one day, but he reinforced it deeply and meticulously. He planted hemp on one side, and in the autumn, he harvested five full baskets. I don't have to worry about oil for eating and lamps for the whole year. I am very happy. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, I personally went to Si's house to thank him. Si was also very happy. I also want to publish his praise in the newspaper. You know how to write, can you write one for me?"
    We believe that the old military family member Chen Hongmo is so enthusiastic, and Li Si also works very hard in tenant farming the land. It should be published in the newspaper to commend him.

　　李四的代耕好
  　军属陈鸿谟要求登报表扬
    编辑同志：
    我们在八号这天到街上宣传，碰见涉县九区寨上村一位六十多岁的老军属，在和他谈话中，他提出有件事情要求替他写个稿子登登报。下面就是他谈的话：
    “我叫陈鸿谟，今年李四的给我代耕的地很好，不用说大块地，就只说春天修堰边，往年都是两个工，大都不好好做，今年四的只用了一天，可是他盘的又深又细。种了一边大麻，秋天收了满满五箩头，一年吃油点灯都不愁了。我很高兴，所以收罢秋，我亲自到四的家里道谢了一次，四的也很高兴。我还想给他登个报，你们会写字，可替我写一篇吧。”
    我们认为老军属阵鸿谟这样热心，李四的代耕地也很用心做活，应该登报表扬。
