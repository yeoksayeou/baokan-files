　　Soviet Afforestation and Forest Protection
    By Motveylov, Soviet Minister of Forestry
    The Soviet Union possesses the world's richest forest resources and maintains the distinction of being the country that has done the most in cultivating forests.

    About a quarter of the world's valuable timber is located on Soviet territory. A vast forest belt of ancient trees stretches across our entire Northern European territory, while vast areas of Siberia are covered by "black pine forests"—a name derived from the boundless darkness within the dense pine and fir forests. However, the Soviet Union continues to engage in large-scale afforestation efforts unparalleled in the world.

    The demand for large-scale afforestation is not driven by the desire to establish more forest resources. The natural growth of forests exceeds annual logging, even though logging is carried out on a massive scale to supply the needs of a vast country like the Soviet Union and to meet export requirements. If France were to engage in logging on a similar scale, its entire national timber resources would be exhausted in less than five years.

    The Soviet Union engages in cultivating new forests to correct the errors of nature and to compensate for the predatory destruction of forests during the Tsarist era. Because the country's main timber resources are located in the north, which is difficult to access, the landlords and capitalists of old Russia found it more profitable to log in the central regions. They were not hindered in any way and ruthlessly destroyed the forests, without any thought for the future.

    By the end of the last century, one-third to one-half of the forests in Belarus, Ukraine, and the central regions of Russia had been greedily felled. The destruction of forests led to changes in the climate. Shoals appeared in rivers, even in the largest ones; and soil erosion, the scourge of farmers, spread to millions of acres of farmland. The fertility of the soil declined.

    This was not only the case in old Russia; in all countries around the world, nature punishes capitalist societies for their predatory exploitation of natural resources. Soil erosion plagues vast areas, constantly threatening half of all cultivated land.

    The United States is one of the countries most severely affected by the consequences of deforestation. Nearly half of the country's forests have been cut down. At the beginning of this century, the vast forest areas most easily accessible and of the highest value had been completely felled. In states such as New York, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and most of the southern states, almost no forests were left. The timber industry moved several times, from New England to the Great Lakes region, and then to the southern states. Now it is concentrated on the Pacific coast. Repeated attempts to stop the destruction of forests have been repeatedly thwarted. It is known that when President Roosevelt attempted to stop the predatory destruction of forests and organize large-scale afforestation, he initially failed due to the resistance of private companies that owned 75 percent of the country's forests.

    With the Soviet Revolution, when the land and all its wealth became the property of the state and the people, the forests for the first time belonged to a thoughtful and far-sighted owner. In areas where forests control water resources, Soviet law prohibits or strictly regulates the felling of trees. Rational management is very beneficial: one more tree growing on the riverbank means an extra ear of wheat in the field. In the Soviet Union, forest-controlled water storage areas cover an area of more than two million square kilometers. It goes without saying that only in a socialist society is it possible to implement a measure of such scale, so valuable to the country, and of such great importance to the entire national economy.

    Protecting forests is one of the important tasks of the Soviet Ministry of Forestry. The forest protection department itself has aerial patrols and firefighting organizations. In the past decade, losses from forest fires have been reduced to a mere fraction (approximately 4 percent) of what they were in the Tsarist era.

    Forests are an outstanding weapon among the important weapons in the struggle of the Soviet people to correct the errors of nature.

    Scientific research has indicated that in any area, forests must account for about 30 percent of the land area in order to perform their soil and climate protection functions. The task of the Forestry Department is to cultivate forests in areas where there are few or no trees. This work began on a small scale at first, and rapidly increased in strength and scale. In 1940, nearly 625,000 acres of new forests were cultivated, which is more than the United States cultivated in a hundred years.

    Science has fully aided this work. Researchers have determined the tree species suitable for afforestation in different regions of the European part of the Soviet Union. Soviet breeding experts provide the country with new tree species.

    These efforts are proving to be very effective. In areas surrounded by new forest belts, soil erosion has been halted: the structure and composition of the soil have changed, the loss of water through evaporation has been reduced, and air humidity has increased. The sum of all these changes is an increase in soil fertility.

    During the war, afforestation efforts were of course drastically reduced. However, this year, the scale of afforestation will return to pre-war levels, and then greatly exceed it. An idea of the scale of afforestation in the five years after the war can be gained from the struggle against drought, which has been launched in the Central Black Earth Region (four provinces). The offensive against drought will be carried out along two fronts: irrigation and unprecedented large-scale afforestation. In the next eight years, only in this region will 2.5 million acres of forest be cultivated; this figure greatly exceeds the British government's plan for the next fifty years.

    This ambitious plan is only one link in the Soviet government's grand plan to protect and cultivate the country's forest resources. Vast forests will be created in many areas. Scientists are eagerly working to help nature, and even improve upon nature's work, cultivating forests in areas where there have never been forests.

    Of particular importance is the cultivation of protective forest belts. Anyone who traveled through severely drought-stricken areas in 1946 would have encountered fertile soil with dense green forests distributed everywhere on the sun-baked land. Crops that survived the disaster were saved by the protective forest belts. In winter, these man-made forest belts, each 15 to 20 meters deep, surrounding the fields are a powerful aid in retaining snow cover; in spring, they conserve soil moisture; and in summer, they protect crops from harsh hot winds.

    These protective forest belts are particularly important in the vast steppes from Western Ukraine to the Volga, where forests have disappeared. Before the war, in this region, every six collective farms had a protective forest belt surrounding the fields. This year, collective farms are eagerly striving to cultivate approximately 200,000 acres of protective forest belts around their fields. The government provides assistance in the form of seedlings and loans. If the new protective forest belts were laid out in a straight line, they would extend for more than 40,000 kilometers.

    The Soviet state invests huge sums of money to preserve and expand the country's timber resources. The state has six research institutes and a series of experimental stations. In special schools for training forestry experts, 20,000 students are studying. Huge state-owned nurseries plant hundreds of millions of seedlings every year. In specialized factories, afforestation machinery is produced.

    In every corner of the vast Soviet territory, the application of forestry has become a daily occurrence. In recent years, special attention has been paid to the Central Asian republics, where large-scale work to transform nature has been carried out. Today, forests protect fertile soil, resist the shifting sands of the desert, and reduce water evaporation in irrigation canals. In Uzbekistan, new forests of pistachio and almond trees were planted last year in the mountains to protect fields from mountain floods and inundation. In the Soviet era, green belts along railways have increased twenty-five-fold, and in the past six years alone, they have been extended by another 10,000 kilometers.

    Thus, the consequences of the private owners' past sinful deforestation are being eliminated in the socialist country. For the first time in history, a country's forest resources serve the people, and their moving effect increases with the passage of years. (Translated by Chen Zhisheng)

　　苏联的造林与护林
    苏联林业部长  莫特韦洛夫
    苏联拥有世界上最丰富的森林资源，并且保持着这样一种荣誉，即它是对于培植森林作得最多的国家。
    全世界有价值的林木约有四分之一是在苏联领土上。古木参天的辽阔的森林带绵亘在我国的整个北欧领土上，在西伯利亚的广大地区则为“黑色松林”所蔽覆——这名称是来自松杉密林中的无边无际的幽暗。然而苏联继续从事着举世无双的大规模造林事业。
    从事大规模造林的要求，并非由于希望建立更多森林资源。森林的天然生长，超过了每年的采伐量，虽然林木的采伐是在巨大的规模上进行，以供应象苏联这样巨大的国家的需要，并满足出口的要求。假如法国以类似的规模从事采伐，则其全部国家林木资源不到五年便会砍光。
    苏联之从事培植新森林，是为了矫正大自然的错误，并补偿森林在沙皇时代所遭到的掠夺性的破坏。由于国家的主要林木资源是处在北方，难于接近，于是旧俄的地主和资本家发现在中部地区进行采伐是更为有利，他们未受到任何阻挠，无情地破坏了森林，一点没有想到未来。
    到前世纪末，白俄罗斯、乌克兰及俄国中部各地区的森林已有三分之一到二分之一被贪婪地伐去。森林的破坏引起了气候的变化。在各条河流，甚至在最大的河流中，都出现了浅滩；而作为农民之灾祸的土壤侵蚀（指土壤因风雨而流失——译者）则扩延到万千亩良田。土壤的肥力下降了。
    这一切不仅在旧俄是如此，在全世界所有各国中，大自然对于资本主义社会之掠夺榨取自然资源，都报以惩罚。土壤侵蚀作用困袭着广大的地区，时时危害到全部耕地的半数。
    美国是最被滥伐森林的后果所严重打击的国家之一。全国森林差不多已有一半被砍去。在本世纪初，人迹易至的最卓越最有价值的广大林区已遭伐尽。在象纽约、明尼苏达、威斯康星等州内及南部大多数州内，几乎没有留下任何森林。木材工业移动了几次，从新英格兰到大湖区（指美加边界的五大湖——译者），又到南部诸州。现在则集中在太平洋海岸。屡次所作的制止破坏森林的企图，屡次被击得粉碎。据知当罗斯福总统企图制止对森林的掠夺性破坏，并组织大规模的造林时，由于拥有全国森林百分之七十五的私营公司的抗力，他一开头便遭到失败。
    随着苏维埃革命，当大地及其全部财富成为国家及人民的财产时，森林有史以来第一次归属于一个深思远虑的主人。在森林控制着水利的地区，苏维埃法律禁止或严格管制林木的采伐。合理的经营是非常有益的：河岸上多长一棵树，意味着田地里增加额外的麦穗。在苏联，森林控制的储水地区占有面积二百万平方公里以上。不用说便可看出：要实行一个规模如此之大，对国家如此有价值，而对整个国家经济有如此巨大重要性的措施，只有在社会主义社会中才有可能。
    保护森林是苏联林业部重要工作之一，护林部门自己拥有航空巡逻及救火机构。在过去十年中，森林火灾的损失已减到仅仅相当于沙俄时代的一个小数点（约为百分之四）。
    在苏联人民所从事的矫正大自然错误的斗争中，森林是各项重要武器中的卓越的一个。
    科学的研究已经指示出：在任何区域，森林必须占土地面积的百分之三十左右，才能执行其保护土壤与气候的机能。林业部的任务是在树木不多或是没有的地区培植起森林来。这工作最初以小规模开始进行，而迅速地增加了发展的力量和规模。在一九四○年间，差不多培植了六十二万五千英亩的新森林，这比美国一百年所培植的森林还要多。
    科学充分地帮助了这项工作。研究人员已得出宜于苏联欧洲部分各个不同地区造林的树种。苏维埃育种专家以新的树种供给国家。
    这些方面的努力正证明是非常有效的。在被新森林带所围绕的地区，土壤侵蚀作用已受到阻止：土壤的构造和成分都已改变，因蒸发而丧失的水分已经减少，空气湿度已经增加。所有这些变化的总和便是土壤肥力的增加。
    在战时，造林事业当然剧烈地缩小。然而今年，造林的规模将重达战前水平，然后并将大大的超过它。对战后五年中造林规模的观念，可得自与干旱相搏战的斗争，这一斗争已在中央黑土区（四个省）发动。进击干旱的攻势，将沿着两条战线进行：灌溉、及规模空前的造林。在今后八年中，仅在这一地区便将培植广及二百五十万英亩的森林；这数字大大地超过了英国政府在今后五十年中的计划。
    这一雄心高远的计划，仅仅是苏维埃政府保护并培植国家森林资源的宏大计划中的一环。在许多地带都将造起广大的森林。科学家热烈地努力帮助大自然，并且甚至改进大自然的天工，在自古没有森林的地区培植起森林。
    具有特殊重要性的，是培植保护林带。每个一九四六年行经严重干旱区域的人，都会遇到在日光焙烧下的大地上到处分布着的绿叶密林的沃土。——在灾难中生存的农作物受到保护林带的拯救。在冬季，这些围绕田地，每条纵深十五至二十米的人造林带，是保留积雪的有力帮助；在春季，它们保存土壤的水分；而在夏季，他们保护农作物不受苛酷的热风所危害。
    在由西乌克兰到窝尔加的森林绝迹的广大草原上，这些保护林带特别重要。战争前，在这一地区，每六个集体农庄有一条保护林带围绕着田地，今年，集体农庄热烈地力图在它们的田地周围培植二十万英亩左右的保护林带。政府以供给树苗和贷款作为帮助。新的保护林带假如拉成直线，便会伸延到四万公里以上。
    苏维埃国家以巨款保存并扩展国家的林木资源。国家设有六所研究机构，及一系列的实验站。在训练林业专家的特别学校中，有两万学生在学习。巨大的国营苗圃，每年栽种数十万万株树苗。在专门工厂中，生产着造林机械。
    在辽阔的苏维埃领土上的每一个角落，森林学的应用已成为每天的常事。在过去数年中，曾特别注意中亚细亚各共和国；在那里进行了规模宏伟的改造大自然的工作。在今天，森林保护着沃壤，抵抗着沙漠中的流沙，并减低灌溉渠中的水分蒸发。在乌兹别克斯坦，去年在山区培植了吉仁和阿月浑子树的新业林，以保护田园免受山洪和犯滥的危害。在苏维埃时代，铁路沿线的绿带已增加了二十五倍，而单单在过去六年中，便已又使其延长了一万公里。
    这样就正在社会主义的国家中肃清了私有主过去罪恶地滥伐森林的后果。在历史上一个国家的森林资源首次为人民服务，而其动人的效果在随着岁月的前进而递增。（陈致生译）
