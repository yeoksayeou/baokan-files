　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 11th: TASS Tokyo reported that a JCP spokesperson announced that the JCP will nominate 116 candidates to participate in the upcoming House of Representatives election. The spokesperson stated: In several constituencies where the Communist Party has formed a united front with the Socialist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party, it will withdraw its own candidates to support the jointly agreed candidates. According to other news agency reports, the tyrannical MacArthur, in order to ensure the election of reactionary Japanese parties and undermine the election campaigns of progressive figures, is brazenly interfering with the election process. In his New Year's message, MacArthur openly warned Japanese voters to select so-called "appropriate leaders." MacArthur, under the pretext of the military government "assisting" the Japanese government in maintaining order during the election, announced the dispatch of a large number of monitoring teams to "supervise" the election before, during, and while counting votes. In Tokyo alone, there are 75 such "monitoring teams." Dentsu News Agency reported that MacArthur's headquarters personnel openly declared: "The intention of this measure is to prevent the election of JCP candidates." At the same time, all candidates have been warned that they must obtain permission from the police station before delivering campaign speeches.
