In the Yangweizi battle on December 11th last year, during the encirclement and annihilation of Huang Wei's army corps, the People's Liberation Army captured the diary of Hong Yuqing, the director of the political work office of the 255th Regiment of the 85th Division of the 14th Army of the enemy. The diary recorded the terror, hunger, and despair of Huang Wei's bandit troops when they were surrounded and annihilated. Excerpts are as follows:

November 27th. We retreated from Badaizhuang. When the enemy's (referring to the People's Liberation Army) pursuit artillery fire was very dense, I fell to the ground, thus escaping from the enemy's bullet pile. They (referring to Chiang's bandit troops) ran around wildly in the fields and suffered many casualties. ... After escaping alive, when counting the number of people, I found that Li Weipei, a clerk in my political work office, was killed in battle, and Wen Xianxi, the company commander of the 3rd company, and Chen Weiji, the company commander of the 5th company, were wounded. Many officers and soldiers in the regimental headquarters were injured, killed, or captured. Everyone fled to the field in front of the village where the army corps headquarters was located to gather. At this time, the regimental commander also gathered some scattered troops, said a few words, and left with the troops. At this time, it was dark again. There were enemies in front, and the army corps headquarters in the village behind did not allow us to pass, trapping the officers and soldiers who had been scattered and had no commanders in this field. We could neither advance nor return, and there was only a dead end. The army corps headquarters' artillery and tanks were aimed at the enemy, and the enemy's machine guns and artillery were aimed at the army corps headquarters. We, the six or seven hundred men without commanders, were in the center of these two sides' guns and cannons. If the two sides were to open fire, we would be turned into meat sauce in the middle. Some officers and soldiers were so frightened in this dangerous situation that they cried. At this time, I was lying on my back in the field, only listening to fate. I heard that our army headquarters was also scattered, the army commander was missing, and the division headquarters was also in disarray. The 10th Division was also beaten into chaos. The commander of the 253rd Regiment (referring to Luo Mengxiong) was killed in battle, and the troops were scattered. Luo Fengyang, the battalion commander of the 1st battalion of my regiment, was injured, and Sun Geng, the battalion commander of the 3rd battalion, was injured and fled. Only the 2nd battalion still had some strength. But all the machine guns were lost. Judging from this, the 14th Army was defeated. It was already dark, and I was only wearing a coat, shivering with cold. At this time, I had a thousand thoughts in my mind, and I shed tears sadly.

November 28th. We barely waited until dawn. I took the officers and soldiers who had been scattered and gathered together and found the troops. The fields and ditches were full of officers and soldiers who had been killed and burned. We strengthened our fortifications on the spot, facing the enemy only one mu of land apart. Yesterday morning, we ate some sweet potatoes and soybeans, etc., and only this morning did we find two rotten raw sweet potatoes to eat in the village. The fields, houses, and threshing floors were all full of people sleeping. The officers and soldiers of the various sections of the regimental headquarters were squeezed into a small house where the regimental commander lived. The company commander and I slept on the ground without even a single blade of grass. At night, when my feet were so cold that they ached, I would often get up and walk around.

November 29th. We have been trapped here for four days, fighting until we are out of ammunition and food. The morale of the troops is panicking. The officers and soldiers are saying, "Our lives are calculated by the moment, calculated by the hour." For two days, we have been eating sweet potatoes and carrots. Even the dead mules and horses have been skinned and eaten. If we are surrounded for another two days, we won't even have sweet potato roots to eat. The orderly, Hua Guo, returned crying with injuries. I sent him to the place where the wounded soldiers were staying. Hundreds of wounded soldiers were sleeping there, groaning and crying, and no one paid attention to them. The wounded soldiers of my regiment surrounded me and said, "We haven't had anything to eat for two days, Director, please think of a way for us!" However, everyone is struggling to protect themselves, so what can I do?

November 30th. Being surrounded in this field, unable to eat or live properly, everything feels uneasy. At 12 o'clock, I went to the wounded soldiers' place. The wounded soldiers were crying, shouting, and the ground was covered with people. Some wounded soldiers only ate a bowl of soybeans and a bowl of thin porridge a day, and some wounded soldiers didn't eat anything at all. In the evening, the enemy attacked. Suddenly, a shell flew over and knocked down half of the wall. Bricks and mud flew all over my head and face. At that time, my brain was dizzy from the explosion. A guard next to me was killed, and Deputy Adjutant Yang was injured. I thought that I didn't die at Badaizhuang a few days ago, that was my second life. Today is my third life.

December 1st. Only ate a bowl of dog meat all day.

December 2nd. At about 5 pm, the enemy fired more than 20 shells at our village. The shelling was very accurate. More than 20 of us were injured, and I was covered in mud.

December 3rd. Several of our soldiers died or were injured. The enemy's artillery fire was very fierce, and everyone was digging shelters. I had to dig myself, which made my back ache and my hands sore.

December 4th. Xiong Shouchun, the commander of our 14th Army, was killed.

December 5th. Last night, the enemy launched a fierce artillery attack on us again. The whole night was spent with our lives threatened in an earth-shattering atmosphere.

December 6th. We have been trapped here for almost two weeks. Now we can only survive on thin porridge without salt and vegetables. This kind of hardship is hard to describe. The officers are full of complaints and are very impatient. ... When it was dark, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our right-wing village. Unfortunately, the 30th Regiment's defense was broken by the enemy's fierce attack, and they withdrew. The regimental commander (note: Ding Chensong) was killed, and the entire regiment's position was occupied by the enemy. After the 30th Regiment collapsed, we will be in danger here. The enemy fired more than 200 shells at our position yesterday. I was in the 5th Company's position when the shell shocked me so much that I was dizzy. Because every time a shell landed, the ground was shaken very high. Finally, a shell exploded five feet away from me. A messenger from the 2nd Battalion Headquarters was killed, and I was stunned by the shell at that time.

December 7th. We are trapped here without food to eat, without cigarettes to smoke, and unable to move. As soon as we move, the enemy's guns and cannons will fire at us. Everyone is sitting in the trenches in a sullen mood. When will these days end?

December 8th. Immersed in this mud and the smell of dead bodies every day, I became ill today. My head was also damaged by the shells a few days ago, and it often aches. I sleep in the cave all day long, feeling sore in my bones. At 9 pm, the regimental commander sent someone to ask me to attend a meeting. He said that the reinforcements of Li Yannian would arrive here tomorrow to "join forces" and asked me to tell the officers and soldiers. I have been constantly promoting the news of the reinforcements to the officers and soldiers, but for a long time, the reinforcements have not arrived, and the officers and soldiers no longer believe what I say.

December 9th. The 254th Regiment was defeated by the enemy in the middle of the night, and the position was occupied by the enemy. We are in even greater danger here.

December 10th. Although the enemy did not attack us last night, when we woke up in the morning, we saw that their fortifications and trenches had been dug in front of our trenches. To be able to achieve such a large project in just one night cannot but surprise every one of our officers and soldiers. From 8 pm, the enemy began to attack us with fierce artillery fire, firing countless shells at us. There were about ten people living in my cave. A shell hit us, killing four soldiers from the Special Service Company and wounding two. The sergeant and messenger from the Secretary's Office were injured. The tragic cries and the earth-shattering sound of the shells were unbearable to witness. At this time, I closed my eyes tightly, lay on the ground, covered my head with a blanket, and waited for death to arrive.

December 11th. Last night, the enemy launched a fierce attack on the outer positions. Many enemies had already reached outside our fence and were building fortifications. Looking at the situation, our life and death could be resolved today. At this time, my heart is broken. Regardless of death, injury, or capture, I only hope to end these days of being besieged today... (Note: As the author of the diary expected, our army captured Yangweizi on the same day, completely annihilating the headquarters of the enemy's 14th Army and the remnants of its divisions and regiments. On the night of the 18th, the entire Huang Wei Army was completely destroyed.)

### 黄维匪军一个政工室主任的日记

　　黄维匪军一个政工室主任的日记
    去年十二月十一日在围歼黄维兵团的杨围子战斗中，解放军缴获了敌十四军八十五师二五五团政工室主任洪雨卿的日记，该日记纪录了黄维匪部在被围歼时的恐怖、饥困和绝望，现摘录如下：
    十一月二十七日我们在白大庄溃退下来。敌人（指解放军）的追击炮火打得非常密的时候，我就倒在地下，这样由敌人的子弹堆里逃了出来。他们（指蒋匪军）满田乱奔乱跑的伤亡了许多。………逃出活命后，清查人数，我政工室的干事李维沛阵亡了，第三连连指文宪锡及第五连连指陈维基负伤了，团部里的官兵伤的、亡的、被俘的有好多。大家逃到兵团司令部村子前面的田中集合，这时团长也收集些零星队伍来了，他说了几句话，带着部队就走了。这时天又黑了，前面有敌人，后面村子兵团部不准我们过去，将我们全军冲散了的、没有指挥官的官兵困守在这田野里，求进不得，望归不能，只有死路一条了。兵团部的大炮坦克车对着敌方，敌人的机枪大炮对着兵团部，我们这六七百没有指挥官的人马就在这两方枪炮口的中央，如果双方要开火，我们夹在这中间会被打成肉酱。有些官兵在这种危险情况下，吓得哭哭啼啼，我这时仰卧在田中，只有听天由命而已。听说我们军部亦被冲散，军长失踪了，师部也弄得溃不成军，第十师也被打得乱七八糟，二五三团团长（指罗孟雄）阵亡，队伍散了，我团第一营营长罗凤阳负伤，第三营孙亘营长负伤逃跑，只有第二营尚有点力量。但所有的机关枪都丢光了，照这看来，十四军是被打垮了。天已黑了，我只穿着一件大衣，身上冻得发抖，这时我心里千头万绪，伤心的流出泪来。
    二十八日，我们好容易挨到天明，我带着冲散收容起的官兵找着了部队，田野和沟渠中打死的、烧死的官兵遍地都是。我们就地加强工事，同敌人只相距一亩地而对峙着。昨天早晨吃了点红薯和菜豆等，到今晨才到村子里找了两个烂的生红薯吃。田地里、房子里、坪里，到处都睡的是人，团部各室的官兵都挤在团长住的一间小屋里，我和连长睡在地上草都没有一根，夜里脚冷得发痛时，常起来走来走去。
    二十九日，我们被围困在这里已经四天了，打得弹尽粮绝，人马吃的东西都发生了恐慌，官兵们都说：“我们的生命是过一刻算一刻，过一时算一时。”两天来都吃的红薯和红萝葡，死了的骡马都剥了皮吃了。再围两天时，我们连红薯根也没吃的了。勤务兵花国负伤哭回来了，我将他送到伤兵住的地方去，几百伤兵都睡在那里呻吟啼哭，没人理会他们。我团的伤兵围着我说：“我们两天都没有东西吃，主任替我们想办法呀！”然而各人都是难保自身，我又有什么办法想呢？
    三十日，包围在这田地要吃没吃要住没住的，一切都感不安。十二时我到伤兵处，伤兵哭的哭，叫的叫，满地睡着都是人，有的伤兵一天只吃一碗黄豆和一碗稀饭，有些伤兵竟没有吃什么。傍晚时，敌人进攻，忽然飞来一颗炮弹，将墙炸倒半边，砖头泥土飞了我满头满脸，当时我的脑筋被炸晕了，将我旁边的一个卫兵炸死了，杨副官受了伤。我想在前几天在白大庄没有死，那是第二世为人，今天这是第三世为人。
    十二月一日，一天只吃了一碗狗肉。
    二日，下午五时左右，敌向我们这村上打来二十多发炮弹，炮打得很准确，我们被打伤二十余名，我被打了满身的泥土。
    三日，我们的几个兵死的死伤的伤，敌人炮火很猛烈，大家都挖掩蔽部，我只好自己挖，挖得腰酸手痛。
    四日，我第十四军军长熊绶春被击毙。
    五日，昨夜敌又用猛烈炮火向我们进攻，整个一夜都在山摇地动中威胁着生命。
    六日，围困在这里已快到两个星期了，现在只有靠没有盐和菜的稀饭渡生存，这种苦况很难说，官员牢骚百出，大不耐烦。……天黑时，敌猛攻我右翼村庄，不幸三十团守地被敌猛攻后，撤下来了，团长（按：为丁尘嵩）被击毙，全团阵地被敌占领去了。三十团垮了后，我们这里会有危急的，敌人昨天打来我们阵地二百多发炮弹，我在五连的阵地里被炮弹震得头晕眼花，因为每一炮弹落下来，地都被震起好高，最后有一个炮弹在我身边五尺之地爆炸，二营部的传令兵炸死一个，我当时被那个炮弹震得人事不知。
    七日，困守在这里已没有饭吃，烟亦没有吸，动也动不得，一动就有敌人的枪炮打过来，大家都闷闷的坐在战壕里。这样的日子何时才会结束呢？
    八日，天天沉浸在这泥土中，死人尸体的气味中，使我今天发生病患，我的头亦被前天的炮弹震坏了，时常发痛，整日在洞里睡觉，实感骨肉酸痛。深夜九点钟，团长派员来请开会，他说援兵李延年明天就会到这里来“会师”，要我转告各位官兵。对于援兵的消息，我不时的在向官兵宣传，结果很长时期仍不见援军到来，官兵都不相信我讲的话了。
    九日，二五四团半夜被敌攻垮了，阵地被敌占领，我们这里越形危险了。
    十日，敌人昨夜虽没有来进攻我们，但早晨起来一看，他的工事战壕已挖到我们战壕前面来了。只一夜时间，就能达到这样大的工程，不能不使我们每个官兵都有惊奇之意。下午八时起，敌人用猛烈的炮火开始向我们攻击，对我们这里打了无数发炮弹，我这洞里住约十人，一个炮弹打来，炸死特务连的士兵四名，伤两名，书记室的上士和传令兵炸伤了，当时惨痛哭叫之声和炮弹打来山摇地动之声惨不忍睹，这时我将双目闭紧，睡在地下用毯子蒙着头，等候死神到来。
    十一日，昨夜敌来猛攻外围阵地，许多敌人已到了我们的鹿寨外面作工事，看情况我们生死存亡就在今天可以解决，这时我的心是破碎的，不管死伤或被俘，只希望在今天了结这被围困的日子………。（按：当日果如日记作者所料，我军攻占杨围子，全歼敌十四军军部及其各师团残余，十八日夜整个黄维兵团完全覆灭了。）
