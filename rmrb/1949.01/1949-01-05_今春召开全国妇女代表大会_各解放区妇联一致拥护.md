Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Women's federations in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Sui, East China, and North China liberated areas have responded to the notice issued by the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China on December 5th of last year. They unanimously support the Preparatory Committee's proposal to convene a National Women's Congress this spring to establish the National Democratic Women's Federation. The Women's Federation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has decided to convene a Women's Congress of the Border Region in Yan'an in late January to summarize the women's work in the Border Region, re-elect the committee of the Women's Federation of the Border Region, and discuss issues related to the National Women's Congress. To this end, the Border Region Women's Federation has decided that each county will convene a meeting of women activists before the 15th of this month. The participants in this meeting must include rural and urban working women, female workers, female students, female teachers, female staff, and female staff in various work departments. At the meeting, the current situation will be reported, opinions on the Border Region and the National Women's Congress will be presented and prepared, and representatives to the Women's Congress of the Border Region will be elected. In addition, elections will be conducted in various agencies and units at the Border Region level, in the press and literary circles, especially among female staff working in the Northwest Field Army, and among organized families of the Field Army, to elect representatives to the Women's Congress of the Border Region. The Border Region Women's Federation also calls on democratic women's groups in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of the Northwest, and democratic women of all nationalities, all classes, all parties, and non-party democrats in the Northwest to unite, use various methods to elect representatives to attend the Women's Congress of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the National Women's Congress, to promote the unity and solidarity of women in the Northwest and the entire country.

The Women's Federation of the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, in response to the proposal of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China, issued a notice to women's federations at all levels on the 13th of last month, calling for: (1) actively mobilizing women to participate in winter production to greet the convening of the National Women's Congress with practical actions; (2) immediately carrying out the preparatory work for the National Women's Congress, convening women's congresses or expanded meetings of activists at the county level to prepare proposals, and summarizing past women's work, contributing experiences and lessons to the National Women's Congress; (3) widely publicizing the news and significance of the convening of the National Women's Congress among the masses of women.

In response to the call of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas, the Shandong Women's Federation and the Central China (formerly Su-Wan Border Region) Women's Federation, in order to unify the women's organizations in East China, jointly decided to establish a preparatory committee for the Democratic Women's Federation of the East China Liberated Area. It was decided to convene the East China Democratic Women's Congress in early February of this year to establish the East China Democratic Women's Federation and discuss issues related to the National Women's Congress. The Preparatory Committee of the East China Women's Federation has notified all localities to convene representative women's meetings with a focus on the county as a unit, based on the specific conditions of the area, re-elect the county Women's Federation committees, and elect representatives to attend the East China Women's Congress.

The original Women's Federation of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and the Women's Federation of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region held an enlarged joint meeting last month, deciding to convene the First Women's Congress of North China this spring, and decided that the two Border Region Women's Federations would work together. The meeting passed a resolution to immediately send a telegram in the name of the two Border Region Women's Federations to the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China, expressing warm support for the proposal to convene the National Women's Congress and establish the National Democratic Women's Federation, as well as the various opinions put forward; hoping to quickly form a national democratic women's federation preparatory committee, and announce the number of representatives and election methods for the National Women's Congress, in order to actively prepare.
