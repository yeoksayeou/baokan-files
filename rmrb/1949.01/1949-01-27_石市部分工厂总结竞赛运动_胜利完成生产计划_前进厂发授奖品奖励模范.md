　　Shijiazhuang Factories Summarize Competition Movement, Successfully Complete Production Plans
　　Qianjin Factory Awards Prizes to Model Workers
[Shijiazhuang News] The competition movement to increase production and compensate for losses during the October war preparation has been successively completed ahead of schedule in some state-owned factories in Shijiazhuang. The railway bureau's Qianjin Factory's engine and rolling stock section's track maintenance team, the water company, and other units have all successfully completed their plans.

At the Qianjin Factory, an award ceremony was recently held to summarize the competition and reward the workers who worked hard in the competition for one and a half months before the new year, resulting in great achievements for the factory. These achievements were first reflected in terms of output, with the average efficiency of repairing locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars increasing by 71% compared to before the war preparation. Secondly, in terms of quality, efforts were made to ensure that the repairs were of high quality and durable. For example, locomotives requiring major repairs had far better replacement parts and accessories than repairs done in October of last year. Everyone said, "Don't be careless, don't cut corners, it's better to guarantee use than to have frequent repairs!" In total, the profits generated by this competition amounted to over 210,000 kilograms of millet. In his summary report, Political Commissar Kang of the factory stated, "The reason why this production increase and loss compensation competition movement was able to achieve these results is due to the concerted efforts of all factory workers and their tireless work. The improvement of leadership methods was also an important reason. A meeting system for discussing work was established in each department, allowing everyone to fully research methods before work. This not only improved work efficiency but also enhanced everyone's enthusiasm, thereby improving production methods and strengthening mutual assistance and unity. Secondly, the factory leadership strived for accurate planning and promptly absorbed the opinions of the workers, enabling the competition to develop more balanced."

The factory has awarded Shao ChunDi, Duan WeiBang, and five others with special prizes and given them the honorary title of "Model Workers." Director Li of the bureau personally awarded each of them a medal and a bonus of 1,000 yuan in People's currency. Many other employees received first, second, third, fourth, and ordinary prizes. As for those who were negligent, idle, or made mistakes during the competition, the factory gave them appropriate punishments based on the severity of their actions when awarding prizes.

The track maintenance workers of the engine and rolling stock section also successfully completed their plan in this competition, achieving the result of "guaranteeing safe train operation and increasing train speed by five kilometers per hour." As soon as the competition began, each track maintenance team challenged neighboring comrades, sparking a surge of enthusiasm for the competition. At the same time, in addition to completing their original plans, each track maintenance team also completed many other tasks. For example, the Huolu track maintenance team completed the side platform of the four tracks in the station, straightened track nails, and replaced screws. The Liuxinzhuang team also carried out the work of spreading stone ballast and repairing sleeper bridges. In order to check whether the quality of the competition tasks was fine and appropriate, the engineering section has established an inspection team to go to various places for inspection.

At the water company, after the production increase and loss compensation movement was launched in early December before the new year, the achievements in the past month have completed half of the entire plan, and it is expected to complete the entire plan one month ahead of schedule. In the factory's monthly work summary, it was stated that in addition to shortening the expected time to complete the task, the engineering and business departments have saved expenses and increased revenue by 34,005.40 yuan in the past month. Furthermore, work efficiency has greatly improved. For example, in the past, collecting water fees often dragged on until the following month, but since the competition began, not only were past arrears cleared, but nearly two-thirds of the water fees for the month of December before the new year were collected, almost completely sweeping away the "dragging" habits that had always existed in the work.

　　石市部分工厂总结竞赛运动
    胜利完成生产计划
  　前进厂发授奖品奖励模范
    【石家庄讯】增加生产补偿去年十月份备战损失的竞赛运动，在石市部分公营工厂中已次第提前完成生产任务。铁路局前进工厂机务段道班工程，和自来水公司等单位，均已胜利完成计划。
    在前进厂，日前举行了总结竞赛的发奖大会，奖励该厂在年前一个半月的竞赛中努力工作，因而获得伟大收获的职工同志们。这项成绩首先表现在产量方面，修理机车、客车和货车的平均效率，较备战前提高了百分之七十一。其次在质的方面，也力求精良耐用，如机车需要大加修理的，在换零件和配件上比去年十月份修理时强得多。大家都说：“不要马虎，不能因陋就简，保用总比经常修理好！”总计这次竞赛产生的利润折合小米二十一万多公斤。该厂康政委在总结报告中称：“这次增产补损竞赛运动之所以能取得是项成绩，除全厂职工的齐心努力，协同一致的不懈工作外，领导方法的改进也是一个重要原因，各所建立起了讨论工作的会议制，使大家在工作前充分的研讨作法。这样不仅提高了工作效率，同时还增强了大家的积极性，从而改进了生产方法和加强了互助团结。其次是厂部领导上的计划力求精确，并且及时的吸取了职工同志们的意见，使竞赛更能平衡发展。
    该厂已授予邵春棣、段维邦等七人以特等奖，并赠给“工作模范”的光荣称号。该局黎局长亲自授给他们每人奖章一枚，奖金人民券一千元。其他获得一、二、三、四及普通奖的职工很多。而对在竞赛中矿工、怠工或犯错误的人，该厂在发奖时视其轻重分别给以适当的处分。
    机务段各道班工人同志在这次竞赛中也胜利的完成了计划，取得“保证行车不出事故，并提高行车时速五公里”的成绩。竞赛一展开，各道班纷纷向邻近的战友挑战，因而激起了竞赛的热潮。同时，各道班除各按原计划完成外，还作了其他许多工作，例如获鹿道班完成了站内四股道的帮道台、整道钉和换螺丝等，柳辛庄也作了散石碴和修枕木便桥的工作。而为了检查竞赛任务在质量方面的是否精细合用，工务段已成立起检查组分赴各地检查。
    在自来水公司，年前十二月初展开增产、补损运动后，一月来的成绩已完成全部计划的一半，预计将提前一月全部完成计划。在该厂月余工作总结中称：完成任务除将缩短预期的时间外，在工务、业务两科一月来已节省开支和增加收入达三万四千零五元四角。并且在工作效率上也大大的往前提高了一步。如象过去收水费常常要拖到下月，但自竞赛开展以来，不仅收清了过去的积欠，年前十二月末，即将该月的水费收进了三分之二，差不多清扫了过去在工作上一贯存在着的“拖拉”的积习。
