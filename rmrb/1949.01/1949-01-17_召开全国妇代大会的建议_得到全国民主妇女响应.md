　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 13th: The call by the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Women's Federation in the Liberated Areas for convening a National Women's Congress and establishing the All-China Women's Federation has been warmly supported by women's organizations in various liberated areas. Recently, responsible persons from other democratic women's organizations and democratic figures from women's circles who have come to the Liberated Areas have also responded successively.
　　Li Dequan, Chairman of the Chinese Women's Friendship Association, replied to Deng Yingchao, Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Women's Federation in the Liberated Areas, saying: A unified national organization of democratic women is extremely important. I sincerely hope that preparations will be stepped up so that it can be established quickly. Recently, Li Dequan, together with Xu Guangping, Chairman of the Shanghai Women's Friendship Association, and Cao Mengjun, a director of the Chinese Women's Friendship Association, jointly replied to Comrade Deng Yingchao, agreeing to participate in the preparatory work, and making suggestions on the timing of the meeting, the methods of electing representatives, etc., so that more representatives can participate and strengthen the lineup of the National Women's Congress.
　　Shen Zijiu, editor of the Nanyang "New Women," former editor of "Women's Life," and one of the initiators of the Shanghai Women's National Salvation Association during the "December 9th" Movement, said after seeing the announcement of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation in the Liberated Areas: The convening of the National Women's Congress will open a bright path for the liberation of Chinese women. It will not only accelerate the overthrow of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and drive the aggressive forces of American imperialism out of China, but will also erect a bright lighthouse for women in Southeast Asian colonies who are struggling for national liberation against American, British, French, and Dutch imperialism, giving them navigational indicators. She said: I have traveled through several liberated areas and have seen and heard with my own eyes that working women in the liberated areas have not only turned themselves over because they have obtained land, but have also been freed from various feudal shackles and stood up strongly, fighting for the thorough liberation of the people and themselves. She also said: Progressive women in Nanyang are eagerly looking forward to the success of the Chinese people's liberation and women's liberation.
　　Yang Gang, a well-known reporter who has just returned from the United States, believes that the convening of the Women's Congress and the establishment of the All-China Women's Federation will be a major event of epoch-making significance in the history of the Chinese women's movement. She suggested that the future congress discuss how to strengthen the activities of the All-China Women's Federation in the International Women's Federation and establish regular contact with the International Women's Federation. She proposed that in the future, the national women's movement must still, like the women's movement carried out in the liberated areas in the past, base itself on the broad masses of working women and peasants.
　　Zhou Ying, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Federation, said: Sisters in Hong Kong and Kowloon have long hoped for a unified national women's organization. The suggestion of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation in the Liberated Areas will undoubtedly be unanimously agreed upon by members of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Federation. She put forward two suggestions: First, I hope that the Preparatory Committee will try to strive for all democratic women's organizations to send representatives to participate in the National Women's Congress, and ask them to prepare opinions to submit to the congress. Second, the National Women's Congress should discuss and determine the general task and general policy of the national women's movement under the new situation, so that women across the country can unite more closely, concentrate their efforts, and strive to accelerate the complete liberation of the people and women across the country.
　　Liu Qingyang, a director of the Chinese Women's Friendship Association and a director of the Beiping Branch Association, told reporters: We fully agree with the suggestion of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation in the Liberated Areas to establish a unified national women's organization. This will make it easier to concentrate efforts to mobilize and organize women across the country to support the People's Liberation War and complete the liberation cause of the Chinese people and Chinese women. She highly praised the women's work in the liberated areas. She said: At the National Women's Congress, we will draw on the experience of women's work in the liberated areas to improve our work. After the establishment of the All-China Women's Federation, I will be a loyal member of it and serve working sisters. She said: After the liberation of major cities across the country, we must pay attention to organizing the production of urban women. Enable them to gain economic independence, more effectively support the front, and then participate in the construction of a new democratic China.
　　Lyricist An E also told reporters that she agreed to convene the National Women's Congress this spring. She hopes that women's schools and schools with many female students can send representatives to participate in the conference.

　　召开全国妇代大会的建议
  　得到全国民主妇女响应
    【新华社陕北十三日电】中国解放区妇女联合会筹备委员会所提出的召开全国妇女代表大会并成立全国妇女联合会的号召，除得到了各解放区妇女团体的热烈拥护外，最近来解放区的其他民主妇女团体负责人和妇女界民主人士也先后响应。
    中国妇女联谊会主席李德全复电中国解放区妇女联合会筹备委员会代主任邓颖超说：民主妇女全国性的统一机构至为重要，极盼加紧筹备，俾能迅速成立。日前，李德全又与上海妇女联谊会主席许广平及中国妇女联谊会理事曹孟君联名复电邓颖超同志，同意参加筹备工作，并对会期、代表的选举方法等均有建议，以便有更多的代表参加，壮大全国妇女代表大会的阵容。
    南洋“新妇女”主编人、过去的“妇女生活”主编及“一二九”运动时上海妇女救国会发起人之一的沈兹九，在看到解放区妇联筹委会的通告后说：全国妇女代表大会的召开将为中国妇女的解放开辟光明道路。不但将加速推翻国民党的反动统治，驱逐美帝国主义侵略势力出中国，并且将对正在与美、英、法、荷等帝国主义分别作民族解放斗争的东南亚殖民地的妇女树立一座光亮的灯塔，给她们作航行的指标。她说：我走过了几个解放区，亲眼看到和听到解放区的劳动妇女不但因为获得了土地而翻了身，并且解除了各种封建束缚，刚强地站起来，在为人民和自身的彻底解放而斗争着。她又说：在南洋的进步妇女正热烈地期望着中国人民解放和妇女解放的成功。
    刚从美国返国的名记者杨刚认为：妇女代表大会的召开和全国妇女联合会的成立将是中国妇女运动史上一件有划时代意义的大事。她建议未来的大会讨论如何加强中国妇女联合会在国际妇女联合会中之活动及和国际妇联建立经常联系的问题。她提出今后全国的妇女运动仍然必须和过去解放区所进行的妇女运动一样，把基础放在广大工农妇女的身上。
    香港九龙妇女联合会主席周颖说：港九姊妹很早就希望有一个全国统一的妇女组织。解放区妇联筹委会的建议，无疑地会得到港九妇联会员的一致同意。她提出两点意见说：一、希望筹委会设法争取所有的民主妇女团体都派代表参加全国妇女代表大会，并要她们准备意见向大会提出。二、全国在妇女代表大会上讨论并确定新形势下全国妇女运动的总任务和总方针，使全国妇女更加亲密团结，集中力量，为加速实现全国人民和妇女的完全解放而奋斗。
    中国妇女联谊会理事及北平分联的理事刘清扬对记者说：解放区妇联筹委会建议成立全国统一的妇女组织，我们完全赞成。这将便于集中力量去动员和组织全国妇女支援人民解放战争，完成中国人民和中国妇女的解放事业。她对于解放区的妇女工作极表赞佩。她说：在全国妇女代表大会上，我们将要吸取解放区妇女工作的经验来改进我们的工作。全国妇女联合会成立后，我将作它的一个忠实的会员，为劳动姊妹服务。她说：全国各大城市解放后，我们必须注重组织城市妇女的生产事业。使她们获得经济独立，能更有效地支援前线，并进而参加新民主主义新中国的建设。
    歌词作家安娥也向记者表示，赞成今春召开全国妇女代表大会。她希望女学校和女学生多的学校都能派出代表参加大会。
