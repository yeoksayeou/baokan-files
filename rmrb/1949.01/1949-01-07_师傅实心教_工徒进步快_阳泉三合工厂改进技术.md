　　Master Teaches Heartily
  　Apprentice Progresses Quickly
  　Yangquan Sanhe Factory Improves Technology
    [Yangquan News] The experienced machinists in the fitter and machine team of the Sanhe Factory, including Xie Shunlun, Shi Jixiang, Liang Kaizhong, and Li Jiali, are very concerned about their apprentices' skills and teach them wholeheartedly. They explain basic knowledge of the work in their spare time and teach them how to do it themselves. Now, four or five apprentices, including Wang Liansheng, Jin Yao, and Li Naihong, can do some simple work on the machines. Production efficiency has not decreased. In the past, it would take apprentices at least three years to learn this much, but now it only takes half a year to be able to work. (Fitter Pan Muru)
    [Further News] The two experienced workers in the furnace top team of the factory, Li Guanglin and Yan Yongdong, are both over fifty years old. Since starting work, they have been very diligent and hardworking and actively engaged in their work. They sweep the raw material storage area very clean and treat the public's tools as if they were their own, taking good care of them. They screen the coke used by everyone very carefully and use it very sparingly. Their spirit of saving raw materials and caring for tools should be praised by everyone.

　　师傅实心教
  　工徒进步快
  　阳泉三合工厂改进技术
    【阳泉讯】三合工厂钳机股机工郄顺伦、石吉祥、梁开忠、李嘉礼等老师傅，对徒弟的技术，非常关心的教，有空时就给讲些干活的常识，还亲手教给做法，现在已有王连生、靳瑶、李乃红等四五个徒弟，都能在床子上干些简单的活了，生产效率并不减低，过去的徒弟，要学成这样，最低也得三年以上，现在只要半年的工夫就能干活。　（钳工　潘穆如）
    【又讯】该厂炉顶股的李广林、阎永东两位老师傅，都是五十多岁的人了，自从上了工，很是勤俭耐劳，工作积极。把放原料的地方，扫得非常清洁，对公家的工具，象自己家里的东西一样爱护，对大家使用的焦炭，筛的很仔细，用的很节省，他们这种节省原料、爱护工具的精神，应该受大家的表扬。
