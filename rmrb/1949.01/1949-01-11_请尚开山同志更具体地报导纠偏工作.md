　　To Comrade Shang Kaishan of Xingtai City:

　　We have received your opinions on the rectification work in Xingtai City, but some of the facts are not specific enough. For example, the poor and hired peasants you mentioned reflect: "Those who are good at speaking up can take advantage and get better and more things; otherwise, not only will they not get more, but they will get junk." Who are these so-called poor and hired peasants? Is it one person or many people? Who are those who are good at speaking up and get more fruits, and who are those who get junk? How many are there? What specific individuals among the old and new cadres are remaining clean and unwilling to get involved, and which are taking the opportunity to grab a share? Which merchant's shops that were struggled against have not been properly resettled? Is it one shop or several shops? These are not written clearly. We hope you will report these specific individuals and specific facts so that we can help the Xingtai Municipal Party Committee better conduct an in-depth inspection and correct them.

　　请尚开山同志更具体地报导纠偏工作
    邢台市尚开山同志：
    你对邢台市纠偏工作的意见，收到了，但有些事实不够具体，如你所提贫雇反映：“好出头好说话的人，就能占便宜，得到更好更多的东西；否则，不但不多而且是些破烂的。”这里所谓贫雇是谁呢？是一个人还是很多人？好出头多分果实的和分到破烂东西的，又是那些人？有多少？新旧干部的反映到底是那些人两袖清风不肯染指，那些人趁机抓一把呢？被斗的商号未得到适当安置，是谁家商号？还是好几家商号？都没有写清楚，希望你将这些具体人物具体事实报导出来，以便帮助邢台市委更好的深入检查，予以纠正。　　——编者
