Jizhong Electric: The Jizhong General Labor Union recently summarized the work of public enterprise unions and proposed future directions. Key points: Since the March conference, the union work in public enterprises and factories at the Jizhong level has achieved the following: 1. Each factory has been able to guarantee the completion of production plans. Some factories have also launched or are in the process of launching the "Three Evaluations" campaign (evaluating learning, evaluating production, evaluating relationships), which has further improved product output and quality. Xinhua Bookstore completed a crash task of 400,000 textbooks in twelve days, working fifteen hours a day. Julong Iron Factory workers urged administrative staff to make plans and initiated challenge competitions. Kiln workers voluntarily requested extra night shifts. In particular, the carters of the Transportation Union, starting in early November, with eighty workers and seventy carts, transported 138,600+ jin of cotton clothing, gloves, and cotton from Jin County to places like Tang County and Lingshou County, traveling 1,400 li round trip, lasting half a month, crossing rivers and ridges, overcoming all difficulties, and completing the task of supporting the front. 2. Among the eight enterprises led by the General Labor Union, since the March meeting to the present, there have been seven directly affiliated factory units, and twenty-nine branches or factory unions have been established. Among the 7,981 employees in the seven enterprise union units, 2,626 are union members (excluding the four tobacco and liquor unions). 3. Attention has been paid to the education and learning of employees, and a preliminary learning system has been established. The unions of three directly affiliated factories and four factories have established spare-time schools. Wang Pin-yi, a technician at Julong Leather Factory, lectured on the entire process from purchasing leather to finished products, which was well received by the workers. Using question-and-answer methods on the blackboard also urged workers to study, such as when some workers asked: "Why does the leather get blisters when it's soaked?" The soaking workers couldn't even sleep, trying to figure out the reason. In addition, due to insufficient leadership from the Jizhong General Labor Union over directly affiliated union units, lacking regular meetings and reporting systems, and the existence of a bureaucratic leadership style, the following shortcomings have arisen: 1. First and foremost, union cadres in various factories have a dependent mentality. For example, the Transportation and Printing Union has not established union work for a long time, relying entirely on administration. Therefore, the enlightenment and education of workers lags far behind the needs of production. 2. In education, some unions do not pay enough attention to the learning of employees, emphasizing that they are too busy with work and have no time, which directly affects the improvement of the working class's awareness and cultural and technical level. 3. Wage issues still have problems of egalitarianism and a single ladder system. The wage difference between equivalent positions and grades is too small. For example, the salaries for both cooking and kitchen work are 30 jin, which greatly hinders the improvement of skills. 4. Insufficient attention is paid to labor protection and workers' welfare. For example, after some factories implemented a comprehensive wage system, the factory did not pay for medical expenses for employees who became ill due to work. Many units did not properly manage insurance funds, and some even spent drug costs arbitrarily, even using cars for personal errands. Based on the above review, the Jizhong General Labor Union proposes the following for future work: Each union must attach importance to this work and find dedicated personnel to be responsible for leading it. It should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner to prevent haphazard actions, and establish systems for learning, testing, review, and summarization. The content should mainly include political, cultural, and technical education. Learning must pay attention to the combination of learning and application. Five, although trade union organizations have been established in public factories, the organizations are not consolidated due to low ideological awareness. Therefore, consolidating the organization has become one of the most important tasks. In order to meet the needs of the situation, the unions in each factory must conscientiously pay attention to cultivating and promoting cadres. Factory unions must be good at approaching workers, staff and local people, understanding the factory's management, the production, thoughts and demands of the employees. Plan and carry out work based on the actual situation. We must learn production technology from employees in order to lead and educate employees to move forward. Six, each public factory will set aside 2.5 percent of the total wage, and the directly affiliated union administration will select three to five people to form a welfare committee to be responsible for the management and operation of insurance funds. Smaller units that cannot operate independently can freely join forces. The use of labor insurance funds should be in accordance with regulations. Union cadres in each factory should be responsible for actively organizing the production of workers' families. First of all, they should strengthen the education of workers on their families and overcome the phenomenon of sitting idle and consuming resources. And give various aspects of help according to the actual situation.

　　冀中总工会总结公营企业工会工作
    【冀中电】冀中总工会，于年前总结公营企业工会工作，并提出今后意见。略称：自三月会议以来，冀中一级各公营企业、工厂工会工作，获得以下成绩：一、各厂都能保证生产计划的完成，有的厂还开展了或正在开展评学习、评生产、评关系的三评运动，使产品的产量和质量都提高了一步。新华书店以每日十五小时的工作时间，十二天完成了四十万册课本的突击任务。聚隆铁厂工人督促行政人员作计划，并提出挑战竞赛。烘炉工人自动要求加夜班。特别是运输工会的大车工人，自十一月初八十个工人带大车七十辆，由晋县运送棉衣、手套、棉花共十三万八千六百余斤到行唐、灵寿等地，往返一千四百里，历时半月，渡河过岭，克服一切困难，完成了支前任务。二、总工会领导的八个企业，三月会议以后至现在，共有了七个直属工厂单位，设立了二十九个分会或厂会的组织。七个企业工会单位，共七千九百八十一名职工当中，有二千六百二十六名是工会会员（四个烟、酒工会还没计在内）。三、注意了职工的教育与学习，初步树立了学习制度。有三直属厂工会及四个厂工会，建立了业余学校。聚隆皮革厂，技术工人王品一，用实际讲购皮到成品的全部过程，博得了工人的欢迎。在黑板报上用问答方法，也督促了工人钻研，如有的工人问：皮子为什么泡花了？泡皮工人连觉都睡不着的研究出道理。另外，由于冀中总工会，对直属工会单位领导上不够，没有定期的会议、汇报制度，存在着官僚主义的领导作风，致产生以下缺点：一、首先是各厂工会干部，存有依赖思想。如运输印刷工会，长期没有树立起工会工作，一切依靠行政。因此对工人的启发教育上，远赶不上生产的需要。二、教育上，还有的工会对职工的学习注意不够，强调工作忙无时间，直接影响了工人阶级的觉悟和文化技术水平的提高。三、工资问题，还存在着平均主义和单一梯形的毛病，等与等、级与级之间，工资差数太少，如烧锅和火头等级都是三十斤，这样对技术的提高有很大妨碍。四、对劳动保护与工人福利事业，领导上注意不够。如有的工厂实行全面工资制后，职工因工致疾者，厂方就不开支医药费，不少单位没有很好掌握保险金，还有的乱行开支药费，甚至开支车子带等。根据上述检讨，冀中总工会对今后工作提出：各工会必须重视，并找出专人负责领导这一工作。有计划的按步就班去进行，防止乱抓。并规定学习测验、检讨、总结等制度。内容上主要是政治、文化、技术等教育。学习时必需注意到学与用的结合。五、公营工厂中虽都建立了工会组织，但因思想上觉悟不高组织还不巩固。因此巩固组织，成为重要任务之一。为适应形势的需要，各厂工会要切实的注意培养提拔干部。厂工会要善于接近工人职员与当地群众，了解厂方的经营管理，职工们的生产、思想、要求。根据实际情况去计划和进行工作。要向职工学习生产技术，才能有办法领导和教育职工前进。六、各公营工厂抽出工资总数的百分之二点五，由直属工会行政选出三人至五人组成福利委员会，负责保险金的掌握和经营。较小的单位，不能单独经营，可自由联合经营。劳动保险金的使用应按规定，各厂工会干部，切实负责积极组织工人家属生产，首先要加强工人对其家属的教育，克服坐吃山空的现象。并根据实际情况给以多方面的帮助。
