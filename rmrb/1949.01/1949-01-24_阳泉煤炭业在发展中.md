　　Yangquan Coal Industry in Development
　　Lü Guangming

　　The coal industry in Yangquan City, which was largely destroyed by the Japanese invaders and Yan's bandits, is now striving to recover and rebuild. The city has a long history of producing large coal for hundreds of years. Before the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, most of the mining was carried out on a small scale using indigenous methods. At that time, Hu Pinzhi, the Governor of Shanxi Province, sold the mining rights of Yangquan, Meng County, and Lu'an to the British "Fu Company." This was opposed by local gentry and various social groups in Shanxi Province, who pooled funds to establish the Tongji, Shourong, and Jinyi coal companies to compete with the foreign "Fu Company." The government, intimidated by public opinion, was forced to allow local people to raise funds to buy back the mining rights (said to be for 2.75 million taels of silver). The original company was reorganized into the Shanxi Provincial Baojin Mining Company, which later degenerated into a bureaucratic capital controlled by Yan Xishan. Especially after the entire Zhengtai Railway was opened to traffic in the first year of the Xuantong reign, convenient transportation greatly benefited the export and development of coal and iron goods in the city. Large capitalists from the south also successively established the "Guangmao" and "Jianchang" coal companies in the city. At this time, large and medium-sized coal mines began to use machinery and semi-machinery for mining. From the 15th year of the Republic of China to the War of Resistance Against Japan, the mining industry in the area was most developed. "Baojin Company" alone had eight large mines with nearly 5,000 workers. "Guangmao Company" had three mines, and together with other medium-sized coal mines, there were a total of thirteen mines using fully mechanized mining, and sixteen using semi-mechanized mining. Among them, Baojin Mines No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 5 had a total daily output of more than 2,000 tons. Guangmao, Jianchang, Pingji, and other thirty medium-sized mines (including seven using indigenous methods) had workers ranging from 50 to 200, with a total daily output of more than 2,000 tons. The remaining hundreds of small kilns with three to five to a dozen people using purely indigenous methods produced about six to seven hundred tons per day, mostly supplying local iron furnaces and residents. In total, there were about 10,000 workers in all the mines and kilns at that time. The coal transported by train to other provinces averaged no less than 3,000 tons per day. It could be transported directly to Tianjin, Tanggu, Wuhan, and Shanghai by train and water.

　　After the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to plunder a large amount of coal, the Japanese invaders established a special organization to rule and monopolize the industry - the so-called "Coal Industry Cooperative," which bought coal at low prices and stipulated that those who sold coal privately would be punished, allowing only mining and no stopping, with those who stopped being confiscated. Most private mine owners, in order to maintain their mining rights, stopped tunnel construction and used a small number of workers to keep up appearances. During the period of Japanese occupation, all the machinery of six mines, including Yumin, was removed. At this time, except for the mines directly confiscated and operated by the Japanese invaders, the output of other private mines was greatly reduced.

　　The miners under the rule of the Japanese invaders and Yan's bandits were very miserable. In order to increase production, the Japanese invaders adopted the "longwall method," that is, expanding ten or twenty meters to both sides, using explosives to blast, and mining indiscriminately without fixed specifications, regardless of the danger to the workers. Being crushed to death or burned to death became commonplace. On average, one or two workers were killed or injured inside and outside the mines every day. In November of the 31st year of the Republic of China, a gas explosion in the second mine killed more than 100 workers at once, and many corpses could not even be found, so many workers were unwilling to work. The workers captured by the Japanese invaders in various places were all confined in houses with wire fences around them, and were escorted to and from work by the puppet mine police. The daily working hours were as long as twelve or thirteen hours. The wages earned were little left after layers of deduction and exploitation by big and small foremen, salt workers, and staff (paying less than what was issued, eating black tokens, etc.), and sometimes they even ate the death benefits of deceased workers. It was common for workers to be beaten and scolded. After Yan's bandits took over, they implemented a policy of "integration of barracks and mines" for frantic plunder. They also established a pseudo-"trade union" to control and squeeze the workers even more severely. In addition to continuing to use the Japanese invaders' set of methods to rule and exploit the workers, the workers also had to pay the pseudo-"trade union" 5% of their wages as regular membership dues, as well as pseudo-cooperative fund fees and "adoption fees." In addition, they also had to pay two months' worth of fort construction fees, equivalent to 40% of their total monthly wages. Yan's bandits, knowing that they could not stay long, even dismantled the machinery of the old third mine and the first mine. By this time, the coal industry in the city had largely collapsed.

　　As for the recovery of the Yangquan coal mining industry, from liberation to April and May of last year, the city was in a period of severe famine (the previous year's harvest was only 20-30%). At that time, starting from the workers' employment and production to overcome the famine, the public lent money and food, and all public and private mines were almost all mined by workers' cooperatives. In order to produce more coal and share more dividends, the workers earned as much as they divided, without accumulating funds, without repairing and building, lacking long-term plans, and not mining according to regular methods, digging the roof, piercing the pillar feet, eating the mine walls, and eating the roadways. Or because of the inability to drain water, they ate along the horizontal line, and even some mines mined across the border, with two or three mines eating each other through. Once a fire or water accident occurred, other mines would inevitably be damaged. It was not possible to correct this in time at that time.

　　After April last year, state-owned mines such as the Fourth Mine, Pingji, Pingshun, and Yuhua were successively taken over by the government. In May and June, in order to implement the policy on industry and commerce, all medium-sized coal mines mined by workers' cooperatives were returned to their original owners, and the original mine owners continued to hire workers to mine. In the spring of last year, the leaders of the city pointed out that Yan's bandits no longer had the strength to invade Yangquan, and everything should be planned for long-term construction, stopping dismantling and transporting and strictly managing. In addition, seven medium-sized coal mines were ordered by the government to stop mining due to serious collapse. In order to maintain the permanent health of the mines and the safety of workers' lives when mining coal, most public and private mines changed the method of coal mining, that is, the height and width were fixed, and the government explicitly prohibited irregular and indiscriminate mining. The government also vigorously supported the mining industry with investment, food loans, and money loans. The Pingshun Mine, which was managed by the government, invested 80 million yuan in local currency at that time to repair boilers, water pumps, and use machinery to drain water, and the monthly output quickly increased to 900 tons. The Yongxing Mine, a joint public-private venture, was also loaned 60 million yuan in local currency for construction costs. In addition, 211.1 million yuan in local currency and more than 71,400 jin of food loans were lent to seven private mines such as Jinxianghou and state-owned mines such as Yuhua.

　　In the past seven or eight months, with the active support of the government, the city's public and private mining industry, as of the end of last year, according to statistics, 111 of the city's 152 large, medium, and small coal mines had been opened. There were a total of more than 3,000 workers, with a total daily output of 1,600 tons. Among the large and medium-sized coal mines that are currently open, two are fully mechanized, namely the Fourth Mine and the Pingji Mine, five medium-sized private mines are semi-mechanized, and nine are mined using indigenous methods. The remaining fourteen medium-sized mines and six state-owned mines could not be mined due to excessive water storage or collapsed roadways and lack of machinery. There are currently 95 small kilns open, most of which are still operated by workers' cooperatives, each with seven or eight workers to more than a dozen workers. These small coal kilns are divided into two types: temporary and long-term. The temporary ones are mostly mined during the slack farming season and are seasonal, but in iron-producing areas, they are mostly mined for a longer period of time to supply fuel to the iron furnace industry.

　　In terms of sales, in addition to supplying the local area, including 205 pig iron furnaces, 105焖 furnaces, 988 wrought iron furnaces, and twelve larger factories, as well as civil use, government agencies, troops, schools, etc., totaling about 600 tons per day, the rest are exported to other provinces. Since December of last year, an average of 1,100 to 1,200 tons have been exported to other provinces every day. As early as October of last year, the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company contracted to sell state-owned coal, and made great efforts to open up sales channels, transporting and selling to Jinnan, Henan, and Jinan, Shandong. At present, the number of trains on the Yangde line has increased, and after the three coal loading sidings are prepared to be added starting in January of this year, it can fully guarantee an increase in daily transportation to 2,000 tons. According to the current production situation, although it cannot keep up with transportation, state-owned mines still have more than 100,000 tons of coal in stock, which can supplement the daily difference. It is expected that after July of this year, it can fully catch up and maintain a daily transportation volume of 2,000 tons.

　　At present, there are still many problems in the private coal mines in Yangquan that need to be improved urgently:

　　(1) State-owned mines have achieved regular mining, but some private mines, except for a few with some construction, mostly simply pursue profits and rarely engage in long-term construction. For example, Fuju Mine and Zhongxing Mine only focus on producing more coal, do not rectify roadways, and eat back coal everywhere. (2) Some private mines mine across the border. For example, several factories such as Dehou Mine and Huziwu have opened up to each other and indiscriminately eat across the border. Desheng and Jinhua had disputes over mining area issues. (3) In terms of mining years, most coal mines in the city have been in operation for more than 20 or 30 years. Under the continuous rule and oppression of the Japanese invaders and Yan's bandits, they have been in disrepair for many years. For example, Maocheng Mine cannot even be excavated. And some do not make long-term plans at all, such as the past Longjiang Mine, holding the attitude of mining for one day at a time, and mining indiscriminately. Since August of last year, the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee has convened an enlarged cadre meeting, and now the mines and kilns have initially moved towards regularization. However, due to lack of experience, the appropriate management of private mines is not enough. The above shortcomings have not been completely changed, and deserve special attention in the future.

　　阳泉煤炭业在发展中
    吕光明
    为日寇阎匪大部摧毁的阳泉市煤炭业，现正力求恢复与重建中。该市出产大炭，有百年的悠久历史。清光绪年间以前，多系小规模的土法开采，当时晋省巡抚胡聘之曾把阳泉、盂县、潞安等四处的采矿权出卖给英商的“福公司”，事为晋省当地士绅及各社团等所反对，集股成立了同济、寿荣、晋益等煤业公司与外国的“福公司”相抗衡，官方慑于社会舆情的责斥，被迫允许当地民众集资购回后（据说此项银赎为二百七十五万两），原有之公司改办为山西全省保晋矿务公司，以后蜕化为阎锡山的官僚资本所控制。特别是在宣统元年，正太路全线通车后，交通畅达，大大有利于该市煤炭和铁货的输出与发展，江南大资本家亦相继在该市成立了“广懋”，“建昌”等两大煤业公司。此时大、中煤矿开始使用机器、半机器开采。民国十五年至抗日战争时止，该地矿业最为发达，光“保晋公司”就拥有八个大矿，近五千工人。“广懋公司”三个矿，连同其他中等煤矿计算在内，共有十三个全用机器开采的，十六个用半机器开采的，以上除保晋一、二、三、四、六、五个大矿，总日产量两千余吨，广懋、建昌、平济等三十个中等矿（内有七个土法开采的），各矿有工人五十个到二百个不等，每日总产量为两千余吨。其余百余座三五个到十余人的纯土法开采的小窑，日产量约六七百余吨，多供给本地铁炉及住户烧用。总计当时全部矿窑工人约在万名左右，经火车输往外省的煤炭，平均每日不下三千吨，车运、水运可直达平津、塘沽、武汉、上海等地。
    抗日战争以后，日寇为了大量掠夺煤炭，在该地成立了专门统治垄断的组织机构——所谓“煤业组合社”，贱价收买煤炭，规定私卖煤炭者受罚，只许开（矿）不许停，停者没收。大多数私营矿主，为了保持矿权，停止坑道建设，用少数工人应付门面。日寇统治时期，被搬走了裕民等六个矿的全部机器。此时除日寇直接没收经营之保晋所属各矿外，其余私营矿的生产量大为降低。
    日寇、阎匪统治下的矿工是很苦的，日寇为了提高生产量，采用了“长壁法”，即十米二十米的向两侧开扩，使用炸药轰，宽高无一定规格的胡乱开采，不管工人危险不危险，砸死、烧死成了平常事，各矿坑内外平均每日都伤亡一二个工人。民国三十一年十一月间，二矿瓦斯起火，一次烧死百余名工人，好多连尸首都找不到，因之许多工人不愿上工。日寇在各地抓捕的工人，都圈在四周围有电网的房院里，由伪矿警队压着上下工，每日工作时间长达十二三个钟头，所挣工资，除大小把头、盐工职员等层层克扣剥削（发多给少，吃黑牌等）外，所剩无几，甚至有时候，还吃到死亡工人的恤金。工人挨打受骂是常事。至阎匪接收后，又在该地实行“兵营合一”的疯狂掠夺政策，还成立了伪“工会”，对工人管制压榨愈加严厉，除照旧使用着日寇对工人那一套统治剥削的办法外，工人还要每月给伪“工会”出工资百分之五的经常会费，及伪合作社基金费、“采用费”，此外还缴纳两个月的相当本人全月工资总额百分之四十的炮楼修建费。阎匪自知不能长在，竟将老三矿、一矿的机器卸走。至此该市之煤炭业大部垮台。
    至于阳泉煤矿业的恢复情况，从解放至去年四五月间，全市处于严重灾荒时期（前年不过二三成年景），当时从工人就业、生产渡荒出发，公家贷款贷粮，公私矿窑几全部由工人合作开采。工人们为了多出炭多分红，挣多少分多少，不积累资金，不修整建设，缺乏长期打算，不按正规办法开采，刨帽顶，穿柱脚，吃矿邦、吃行道。或因无法排水，且顺着水平吃，甚至有些矿越界开采，两三个矿互相吃通，一旦发生水火，他矿必连带受损。当时未能作到及时纠正。
    去年四月以后，四矿、平济、平顺、裕华等公营矿相继为政府接办，五六月间为贯彻执行工商业政策，将工人合作开采之中等煤矿一律退还原主，由原矿主继续雇工开采。去年春天，该市领导方面指出：阎匪已没有力量再侵占阳泉，一切要为长期建设打算，停止拆卸搬运并严格管理。另有七座中等煤矿，因塌坏情况严重，由政府下令停止开采，为了保持矿的永久健康与工人采炭时的生命安全，公私矿多改变了采炭法，即宽高有一定规格，由政府明令禁止不正规的胡乱开采，政府并以投资、贷粮贷款来大力的扶植矿业。经政府代管之平顺矿，当时公家投资边币八千万元，以修理锅炉、水泵、使用机器排水后，月产量很快提高到九百吨。公私合营的永兴矿，公家亦贷给了六千万元边币的建设费。此外又贷给晋祥厚等七个私营矿及裕华等公营矿计二亿一千一百万元边币，七万一千四百余斤的贷粮。
    近七八个月来，该市公私矿业，在政府积极扶助下，至去年底统计全市一五二座大、中、小煤矿，已开办了一一一座。共计三千余名工人，总日产量为一千六百吨。以上现开之大中煤矿，内有两个全机器开采的，即四矿、平济矿，五个中等私营矿是半机器开采的，又九个是土法开采的。其余十四个中等矿及六个公营矿，多因存水过多，或行道塌毁，缺乏机器而未能开采。小窑现开者有九十五座，仍多为工人合作经营，各有七八个工人到十余个工人不等。这些小煤窑分临时的长期的两种，临时的多在农闲季节开采，带有季节性，但在产铁地区，为供给铁炉业燃料，多作较长期的开采。
    在销路上，除供给本地包括二○五座生铁炉、一○五座焖炉、九八八座熟铁炉，及十二个较大工厂，与民用，机关、部队、学校等烧用共计每日约六百余吨外，其余的均输出外省，自去年十二月份起，平均每日输出外省者达一千一二百吨。早在去年十月由正太煤铁公司包销公营煤炭以来，用极大努力打开销路，运销冀南，河南，山东济南各地。目前阳德线车运已增多班次，开于本年一月份起准备增修三道装煤道岔后，即可完全保证每日增运到两千吨。按目前生产情况，虽赶不上运输，但公营矿尚有十余万吨存煤，可补充其每日差额。预计到今年七月份以后，可完全赶上每日保持两千吨的运输量。
    目前阳泉私营煤矿，尚存在不少问题，须急待改进：
    （一）公营矿已做到正规开采，但一些私营矿，除少数有些建设外，大多数为单纯追逐利润，很少作长期建设。如阜聚矿，中兴矿等只顾多出煤，不整顿行道，且到处吃回煤。（二）有些私营矿越界开采，如德厚矿，狐子窝等几个厂互相打通越界乱吃。德盛与晋华为矿区问题发生了纠纷。（三）在开采年代上，该市大多数煤矿均在二三十年以上，在日寇、阎匪连续统治压榨下，多年失修，如茂昌矿等，甚至无法掘进。并有的根本不作长期打算，如过去的龙江矿等，抱着采一天算一天的态度，胡乱开采。自去年八月间，阳泉市委召开了扩大干部会议，至今各矿窑已初步走向正规。但由于缺乏经验，对私营矿的适当管理还不够。上述缺点，还没有彻底转变，今后值得特别注意。
