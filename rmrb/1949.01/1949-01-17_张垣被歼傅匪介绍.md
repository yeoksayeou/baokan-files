(Pingjin Front Dispatch, 28th) The Communist forces annihilated five infantry divisions and two cavalry brigades of the Fu bandit troops in Zhangjiakou. These included the 210th, 259th, and 251st infantry divisions of the 105th Army, the 258th Division of the 104th Army, and the 310th Division directly under the Beiping "General Suppression Headquarters." Additionally, the 5th and 11th Cavalry Brigades were also eliminated.

The 105th Army, formerly the Provisional 4th Army of the Fu bandits, was established in 1940. At that time, Fu Zuoyi, serving as the Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang's "Eighth War Zone," passively resisted the Japanese while expanding his personal power in the Wuyuan area of Suiyuan. He expanded the original 35th Army with the addition of the Provisional 3rd and Provisional 4th Armies. In the spring of 1945, the Provisional 4th Army designation was cancelled. After Fu Zuoyi occupied Zhangjiakou in October 1946, the Provisional 4th Army was re-established, consisting of three infantry divisions: the 210th Division, formed from Fu Zuoyi's 101st Training Division; the 27th Division, reorganized from Ma Zhanshan's newly formed 5th Cavalry Division; and the 26th Division, reorganized from the original Independent 2nd Brigade and the 6th Training Division.

In 1947, after Fu Zuoyi was promoted to Commander of the North China "General Suppression Headquarters," he adjusted and reorganized the 35th, Provisional 3rd, and Provisional 4th Armies. The 26th Division of the Provisional 4th Army was incorporated into the 35th Army, the 27th Division was incorporated into the Provisional 3rd Army, and the Provisional 4th Army, in addition to the original 220th Division, received the New 32nd Division (now the 251st Division) from the 35th Army and the Provisional 11th Division (now the 259th Division) from the Provisional 3rd Army. Over the past year, this army was continuously equipped, becoming one of Fu Zuoyi's three main core forces. It was frequently stationed near Zhangjiakou and sometimes deployed east and west with the 35th Army to counter our army's offensives. In early April of this year in Tianzhen Guqianbao, and in early October in Xinghe, it narrowly escaped encirclement and annihilation by our forces. Its 259th Division, transferred from the Provisional 3rd Army, was completely annihilated in the Zhuangding Beiyian area of Laishui during the Laishui campaign in January of this year, and its commander, Liu Mingding, was killed by our forces. During and after the Zhangjiakou campaign, the 310th Division (newly established) directly under the enemy's "General Suppression Headquarters" in Beiping was temporarily under the command of this army. At this time, the army numbered approximately 32,000 men.

The 105th Army's four divisions, the 258th Division of the 104th Army, and the 5th and 11th Cavalry Brigades, under the unified command of Sun Lanfeng, commander of the Fu bandit's 11th Army Corps, were completely annihilated by our forces on the 24th.
