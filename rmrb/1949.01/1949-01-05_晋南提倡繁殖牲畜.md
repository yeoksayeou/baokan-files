Xinhua News Agency, Linfen, 31st. To overcome the difficulty of livestock shortage and to facilitate the development of agricultural production, the Southern Shanxi Administrative Office is actively promoting livestock breeding. According to survey results, there is a considerable lack of draught animals in Southern Shanxi. Currently, most areas have only one draught animal for every sixty mu of land (according to estimates from the Agricultural Institute of North China University, one draught animal in Southern Shanxi can cultivate an average of thirty mu), and the lack of breeding livestock has become one of the main difficulties in breeding livestock. The Southern Shanxi Administrative Office is therefore advocating and encouraging farmers to raise breeding livestock, and is promoting the absorption of experienced farmers to specialize in livestock breeding, believing that this is the main way to increase livestock. Under the advocacy of the Administrative Office, farmers in Xinzhuang, Hongdong County, have formed a draught animal breeding association, and are taking breeding livestock to various parts of Southern Shanxi for breeding. This village has always been famous for engaging in draught animal breeding; three-quarters of the residents are engaged in this industry, and their footprints are all over the counties of Southern Shanxi. The plundering by the Japanese invaders and Yan bandits almost wiped out the public livestock in the village. With the help of the democratic government, the number of breeding male livestock in the village has now recovered to thirteen, and there are plans to add fourteen more. Xie County specially convened a breeding technology research meeting at the end of November to exchange livestock breeding experience for promotion. The Quwo County Bureau of Industry and Commerce hired farmer Zhang Shengrui to specialize in breeding work, and has achieved significant results in recent months. There are currently about 220,000 head of livestock such as cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses in the entire Southern Shanxi region. According to the person in charge of the Construction Department of the Southern Shanxi Administrative Office, if the promotion of breeding is effective, then 30% of the 220,000 livestock will be female, and 6000 to 7000 young livestock can be bred next year. With breeding year by year, the number of livestock increased will be considerable.
Another way to increase livestock is to purchase livestock from other regions. From January to August this year, Pinglu County purchased 2,730 head of livestock from the south bank of the Yellow River; some areas of Wenxi and Xinjiang counties also used this method to increase the original livestock by 10%. The Southern Shanxi Administrative Office believes that although this method of increasing livestock is simple, it does not fundamentally solve the problem. Because although Southern Shanxi has increased the number of livestock due to purchases, the number of livestock in the friendly neighboring liberated areas that sell livestock and the Kuomintang-controlled areas that are about to become liberated areas will decrease accordingly, so in general, the total number of livestock has not increased. Therefore, the basic method of increasing livestock should still be breeding.

### 晋南提倡繁殖牲畜

　　晋南提倡繁殖牲畜
    【新华社临汾三十一日电】为了克服牲畜缺乏的困难以利于发展农业生产，晋南行政公署积极提倡繁殖牲畜。据调查结果，晋南耕畜相当缺乏：目前大部地区平均六十亩地才有一头耕畜（据华北大学农业院估计，晋南一头耕畜平均耕地能力为三十亩），而配种牲畜的缺乏，已成为繁殖牲畜的主要困难之一。晋南行署因此提倡鼓励农民饲养配种牲畜，提倡吸收有经验的农民专门从事牲畜配种工作，认为这是增加牲畜的主要办法。在行署的倡导下，洪洞县辛庄农民已组成耕畜繁殖会，纷纷牵着种畜到晋南各地配种。该村一向以从事耕畜配种著名；居民中四分之三以此为业，足迹遍晋南各县。日寇阎匪的掠夺使该村公畜几乎绝迹。在民主政府帮助下，该村配种公畜现已恢复到十三头，还计划增加十四头。解县于十一月底特召开配种技术研究会，交换牲畜配种经验以便推广。曲沃县工商局聘请农民张生瑞专门从事配种工作，数月来已有显著成绩。晋南全区目前共有牛、驴、骡、马等牲畜约二十二万头。据晋南行署建设处负责人称，如提倡繁殖有效，则二十二万头牲畜中百分之三十的母畜，明年即可繁殖幼畜六七千头。以后逐年繁殖，牲畜的增加数目将大有可观。
    另一个增加牲畜的办法是自其他地区购买牲畜。平陆县今年一月至八月即从黄河南岸买进牲口二千七百三十头；闻喜、新绛等县部分地区也用这种办法增加了原有牲畜的百分之十。晋南行署认为这种增加牲畜的办法虽然简捷，却没有根本解决问题。因为晋南由于买进虽增加了牲畜数目，但卖出牲畜的友邻解放区　以及即将成为解放区的国民党统治区，其牲畜数目即相应地减少，是以整个说来，牲畜总数并未增加。因此增加牲畜的基本方法还应当是繁殖。
