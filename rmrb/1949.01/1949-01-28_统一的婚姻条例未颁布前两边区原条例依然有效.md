　　Original Regulations Still Valid in Both Regions Before the Promulgation of Unified Marriage Regulations
Comrade Editor:
    In the "Inquiry and Reply" column on page four of the December 31st People's Daily, in the article "Marriage Permissible with Significant Age Difference," the Ministry of Justice replied: "Regarding the legal age for marriage, there are no restrictions other than men under twenty and women under eighteen not being allowed to marry." However, the marriage regulations of the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region stipulate that men under eighteen and women under sixteen are not allowed to marry. Has this been changed now? Please provide a detailed answer.
　　Xiyang Cultural Society, Ji Zong

Comrade Ji Zong:
    After the establishment of the North China People's Government, the marriage regulations promulgated by both regions are of course still valid before the unified marriage regulations are promulgated. Regarding the differences, the original two regions can temporarily implement their respective regulations separately.

### 统一的婚姻条例未颁布前两边区原条例依然有效

专栏：询问与答复

　　统一的婚姻条例未颁布前两边区原条例依然有效编者同志：
    在十二月三十一日人民日报第四版“询问与答复”栏所载之“男女年龄悬殊可以结婚”一稿中，司法部答复说：“结婚年龄在法律上，除男不满二十，女不满十八，不得结婚外，没有其他限制”。但前晋冀鲁豫边区的婚姻条例上却规定男不满十八，女不满十六不得结婚，现在是否变更了？请详答。
　　昔阳文化社　继宗继宗同志：
    华北人民政府成立后，统一的婚姻条例未颁布前，两边区所颁布婚姻条例当然有效。其中不同之点，原两边区暂可分别执行。
