　　Soldier Retires Home Due to Age
  　Is He Considered a Military Family Member? Does He Need to Perform Service?
    Editor:
    In our village, there is a soldier who joined the army in the winter of 1946. He worked in the kitchen unit. Last year, he also received credit for persistently carrying oil drums. He is about fifty years old, and his eyesight is somewhat blurry. He falls more than twenty times during a single night march, and his leg tendons are injured, causing him to frequently fall behind. The unit leader finally gave him grain coupons and told him to return home in late October. After county approval, he was designated as a fourth-class honorably discharged soldier and is recuperating at home. The village cadres say he is not considered a military family member, so they are not providing any assistance. On the other hand, they still want him to go on errands. Please, editor, answer: Is he considered a military family member? Should he perform wartime service?

    Answer: According to the "Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Pensions for Honorable Servicemen" promulgated by the North China Region, all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who are wounded in combat and become disabled are referred to as honorable servicemen. According to what you have said, that comrade broke his leg during a march and was rated as a fourth-class disabled person (the grade can be re-evaluated according to the new regulations; if the injury occurred during a march in the rear, the treatment should be assessed according to the injury incurred on official duty). He should enjoy the treatment prescribed by the government. However, since he has left the army and returned home, his family members should not be called military family members, nor should they enjoy the treatment of military family members. Regarding the issue of service, he should be treated the same as ordinary citizens. If he is indeed physically weak and has difficulty moving, a portion or all of his service can be reduced or exempted with the approval of the district office after being passed by the village assembly.

　　军人衰老退伍回家
  　算军属吗？服勤吗？编辑同志：
    我村有位军人自民国三十五年冬初参军，在部队火房担任工作，去年也立了一件担油桶不懈的功劳，他年纪大约五十左右，眼睛有点混珠，夜间行军一宿跌倒二十余次，腿的筋骨受伤，时常掉队，从十月底部队首长才给他粮票叫他返家，经县批准为四等荣誉军人，在家休养，村干说他不算抗属，一方面不给照顾，另一方面还想叫他出差。请编辑同志解答：是否算抗属？是否应出战勤？

    答：按华北区颁布之荣誉军人优待抚恤条例规定，凡人民解放军之指战员因参战负伤致成残废者，均称荣誉军人。按你所谈的那个同志，因行军把腿摔坏，并评为四等残废，（可按新条例重新评定等级，如是后方行军摔伤，应按因公致残评定待遇）即应按政府规定享受待遇，但已脱离部队，退伍回家者，其家属不得称为军属，更不得享受军属之待遇。服勤问题，应与一般公民同。如确实身体病弱，行动困难者，可经村民大会通过区公所批准后，酌情减免一部或全部。
