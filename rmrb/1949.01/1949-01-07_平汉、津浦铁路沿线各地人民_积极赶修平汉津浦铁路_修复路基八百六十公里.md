　　People Along the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways Actively Repair the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways
  　860 Kilometers of Roadbed Repaired
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the situation of our military victory advancing forward, in order to rapidly restore railway transportation, support the front lines, and develop production and construction, the people along the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways are excited and encouraged. Under the leadership of the democratic government, they are rushing to repair the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, and have demonstrated a high degree of organization and planning. In a short period of time, 860 kilometers of roadbed have been repaired. After receiving the order from the North China People's Government to repair the railways, the Taihang Administrative Office immediately relayed the order to each special district to carefully formulate engineering plans and construction methods. Each county was led by the county head in person to organize the county road repair command. From the county down to the village, in addition to establishing a very strict organization of civilian workers, propaganda teams were organized to carry out propaganda and mobilization work for the civilian workers. Air defense and alert organizations were responsible for air defense and the security of villages along the line, and old railway workers were recruited to form inspection teams to inspect the construction of each section of the roadbed at any time. The people in various places along the railway line, encouraged by the situation of our military victory, and understanding that repairing the railway would greatly help develop production and construction and improve people's lives, enthusiastically participated in road repair. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the civilian workers, awards were given to the civilian workers during the road repair, and prizes were awarded. In the first special district of Taihang (Xingtai, Yuanshi, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Gaoyi and other counties), the award flags made by each county were hung high on the telegraph poles next to the railway. Along the 860-kilometer-long Pinghan and Jinpu railway lines, the civilian workers are now personally filling in the roadbeds that they personally destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War or the People's Liberation War in order to resist the enemy, section by section. More than 52,500 civilian workers from the first special district of Taihang participated in the road repair. The 170 *hua li* of roadbed destroyed in the entire district in the past were all repaired in four days. More than 43,000 civilian workers from Jizhong participated in the repair of the Pinghan and Jinpu railways, and repaired 200 *hua li* of the roadbeds of the two railways in six days.
