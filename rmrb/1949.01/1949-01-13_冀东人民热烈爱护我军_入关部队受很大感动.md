　　The Northeast People's Liberation Army entering the pass, under the ardent welcome and care of the people of Jidong, has received great encouragement and education. A new soldier in a certain unit, seeing the masses along the way decorating with lanterns and colored banners to welcome the troops, immediately wrote an article to the newspaper, saying: "When I heard the masses shout slogans like 'Welcome the Northeast People's Liberation Army to enter the pass and liberate the suffering people of Beiping and Tianjin,' my heart was burning. Before entering the pass, I still harbored thoughts of pleasure-seeking. How shameful! From now on, I will resolutely follow the Communist Party and liberate all the oppressed people of China to answer the people's hopes for us." Comrade Sun Weijun, a baggage team member in a certain unit who was liberated during the Jinzhou Campaign, once attempted to desert. Although he was educated, his mood remained low. After arriving in Jidong, upon hearing stories from the masses about the cooperation between the military and civilians during the War of Resistance, how the Communist Party and the democratic government improved the people's lives, and how military families and veterans were taken care of by the government and farmers' associations, he felt that he was not as advanced as the ordinary people. He became so upset that he cried and ran to the company headquarters to express his determination to seek progress. The baggage team of a certain unit stayed in the home of a landlord surnamed Feng. The landlord asked Comrade Li Chenghui of the team whether he was a Communist Party member. Comrade Li Chenghui, because he had not joined the party, was ashamed and lowered his head. The landlord sincerely encouraged him to study hard and strive for progress in the future. The team members were greatly moved, and Comrade Li Chenghui also resolved to improve himself to the level of a party member in order to join the party, requesting the superiors to give him arduous tasks during combat to test him. A guard in a certain unit took off his socks and placed them on the heated brick bed. The landlord's wife secretly took them away, washed and mended them, and returned them. The comrade immediately wrote "Pick up a few more loads" under the item "Carry water for the masses" in the love-the-people plan. Yang Qifa, a newly liberated soldier from the Fifth Company of a certain unit, in the past, when studying the talks of the responsible person of the Party Central Committee, expressed disbelief that the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang could be fundamentally overthrown in about a year. Later, after seeing the great strength of the Jidong masses and their support for the People's Liberation Army, he corrected his erroneous views and said: I recognize the strength of the Communist Party, and I believe that it is entirely possible to defeat Chiang Kai-shek in one year.

　　冀东人民热烈爱护我军
  　入关部队受很大感动
    【新华社平津前线七日电】进关的东北解放军，在冀东人民热烈欢迎与爱护之下，受到很大的鼓舞和教育。某部一新战士看到沿途群众张灯结彩欢迎部队时，立即写稿寄给报社说：“当我听到群众喊出‘欢迎东北解放军进关，解放平津受苦受难的老百姓’等口号时，我心里热辣辣的。在没进关前，我还抱着享乐思想，这是多么的可耻！今后我一定坚决跟着共产党走，解放全中国受压迫的人民，来回答老百姓对我们的希望。”某部辎重队一个锦州战役解放过来的孙维俊同志，曾企图开小差，虽经教育，仍情绪不高，到冀东后，因听到群众讲抗战中军民合作的故事，讲共产党和民主政府如何改善人民生活，讲军属和荣誉军人如何得到政府及农会的照顾等等，觉得自己还不如老百姓进步，竟难过得哭起来，跑到连部表示决心要求进步。某部辎重队住在一个姓冯的房东家里，房东问该队李成晦同志是否共产党员，李成晦同志因没有入党，羞得低下头来。房东便诚恳的勉励他，今后要努力学习求进步，该队队员大受感动，李成晦同志也下决心提高自己达到党员水平以期能够入党。要求上级在战斗时给予艰巨的任务来考验他。某部一警卫员，把袜子脱下后放在炕上，房东大娘偷偷的拿去洗净又补好送回来，该同志当即在爱民计划“给群众挑水”一项下面写上“多挑几担”四个字。某部五连新解放过来的战士杨起发，过去在学习党中央负责人的谈话：一年左右就可能从根本上打倒国民党反动统治时，还表示不相信，后来看到冀东群众的伟大力量及其拥护解放军的情形，即改正其错误观点说：我认识了共产党的力量，我相信一年打垮蒋介石是完全可能的。
