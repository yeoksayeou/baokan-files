　　Agricultural Situation in North China in December
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In December of last year, the rural production in North China mainly focused on vigorously preparing for this year's large-scale production campaign. Meanwhile, it also developed diversified sideline production based on local conditions.
    Since the spring plowing season this year is not far away, the masses in the entire region have devoted themselves to preparations for large-scale production, such as building water conservancy projects, increasing livestock, repairing agricultural implements, and accumulating fertilizer. Except for some areas in Central Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Northern Yue, and Central Shanxi, which were affected because they failed to combine support for the front lines with production, most areas in the region achieved great results. In terms of water conservancy construction, the projects completed in December included: the Central Shanxi District repaired nine canals, including Guanghui and Guangji, along the Fen River and dozens of branch canals, which can increase paddy fields by 880,000 mu. The Northern Yue District completed the construction of 28 rivers and canals, which can increase paddy fields by 17,500 mu. The Central Hebei District built one canal, which can increase paddy fields by 123,000 mu, and increased and repaired dozens of waterwheels, which can increase paddy fields by 854 mu. The Taihang area repaired 11 canals. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District dredged three rivers, expanding the cultivated area by 16,400 mu. The reasons for the above achievements are mainly due to the careful planning and vigorous support from the Party and government at all levels in North China. In particular, the Central Shanxi District combined support for the front lines and organized a group of cadres to mobilize the masses to repair canals. They provided specific assistance and guidance, solved various difficulties, eliminated the years of disputes between farmers upstream and downstream of the Fen River, and united to repair the canals, so that the Fen River water conservancy, which had been in disrepair for many years under the rule of Yan Xishan's bandits, could be quickly restored. During the canal repair period, war service was adjusted in a planned way, so that villages repairing canals temporarily reduced or did not send migrant workers. Women, children, and elderly laborers were mobilized and organized, and poor peasants from non-water conservancy villages were absorbed into canal repair through work-for-food programs, ensuring the timely completion of the construction project. In the Northern Yue District, Lai Zhuo County also completed the plan to increase paddy fields by 7,600 mu early by implementing the method of mobilizing the masses, relying on self-reliance, and cooperating to open canals, with government support. Conversely, the construction of the Rongzhen Canal in Quyang County, due to the cadres' lack of organization and mobilization of the masses, relied on loans for everything, and all projects were paid for with loans. The masses regarded the canal as government-run, and as a result, although 110,000 jin of grain were loaned, the plan was still not completed. In terms of protecting and breeding livestock: According to surveys in various places, the number of livestock in the entire region has decreased by 50% compared to before the war. Especially in the Eastern Hebei District, due to the devastation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the reduction was even greater. According to statistics in the district in 1946, there were more than 400,000 head of livestock, but last year it was reduced to 167,690 head, with each head of livestock bearing the burden of cultivating 100 to 200 mu of land. At present, due to the stable environment, the areas are connected, and the masses' enthusiasm for production is high after the land reform, and they have accumulated funds to buy livestock. Therefore, the number of livestock in various places is gradually increasing. In Baodi, Yutian, Zunhua, Fengrun, and Lutai areas of Eastern Hebei District, state-owned stores are leading the masses to transport native cloth to the Rehe livestock area to exchange for livestock. According to statistics in the Eighth District of Baodi County: 120 head of livestock have been bought back. In Ningnan County of Southern Hebei District, the number of livestock in the county was 4,993 in November, which increased to 5,099 in December. In Heshun County of Taihang District, the number of donkeys and mules increased by 426, cows by 40, and breeding males by 7 in December. Some areas have taken effective measures to increase livestock. Heshun County in Taihang was a livestock breeding area in the past. During the winter production, the CCP County Committee decided to vigorously restore livestock breeding. The county branch of the People's Bank of China loaned 300,000 yuan (RMB, same below), using 150,000 yuan to support the livestock farm to raise cattle herds, 40,000 yuan to support the breeding of breeding livestock, and also identified 12 key villages in the county to mobilize the masses to use loans to absorb idle funds to buy livestock. Two batches of 115 head of livestock have been purchased from the livestock area of ​​Hequ in Northwestern Shanxi, and they were all sold out in one day. The masses are still automatically raising funds to ask the county branch to take them to buy livestock. Members of the county cooperative are also asking not to share dividends but to buy livestock. With the support of the government, five breeding livestock mating stations and one livestock farm have been established in five districts. Zhentang County in Southern Hebei District paid special attention to protecting livestock, held a forum for veterinarians and breeding livestock households in the county, discussed methods for protecting and breeding livestock, organized veterinarians to participate in Chinese and Western medicine research associations, and stipulated that service can be reduced or exempted when livestock are suffering from infectious diseases. It also helped and encouraged breeding livestock households, and promoted among the masses the feudal viewpoint of protecting livestock and opposing neglecting veterinarians and breeding livestock households. Tang County in Northern Yue District stipulated incentive programs for breeding livestock, female livestock, and young livestock. On the contrary, the Promotion Society in Changwan County of Northern Yue District blindly loaned money to farmers to buy livestock without specific guidance, only buying and selling locally, which could not increase livestock, and even wasted livestock loans. For example, in Gaoping County of Taiyue District, 320 head of livestock died in the county from January to October last year, including 62 head of livestock that died on a trip to Jixian County to transport grain, and 193 head died of illness during peacetime. In Liujiashan, the Fifth District of the county, there were 40 head of livestock last year, an increase of 20 head, and 9 head died, with the number of deaths accounting for 41% of the increase, proving that the masses urgently need measures and knowledge to protect livestock. At the same time, there is still a phenomenon of secretly slaughtering draft animals in Hejian and Xianxian areas of Central Hebei. The above experiences and lessons should be paid serious attention to. In terms of accumulating fertilizer: Specific leadership was carried out in some areas, and various methods of accumulating fertilizer were investigated and studied based on local natural conditions and promoted. Luannan County (newly established county, southern Luannan County) in Eastern Hebei District promoted the increase of 1,657 toilets, 106 pig pens, and 120 composting pits in the county, and increased 982 pigs. In Luannan County, each mu has now reached 12 loads of fertilizer, and with continued efforts to accumulate fertilizer until spring plowing, each mu can reach more than 17 loads, an increase of six times compared to the amount of fertilizer applied in previous years. Qinghe County in Southern Hebei District added 3,790 new manure piles. Under the leadership of labor hero Cao Linshui, Nantianhe Village in Changzhi County, Taihang District, is preparing to apply 90 loads of manure per mu, and has now accumulated enough fertilizer for 710 mu of land, but is still short of fertilizer for 845 mu. They are using methods such as smoking soil fertilizer, digging pit soil composting, and extracting oil to accumulate oil cakes to strive to complete the plan before spring plowing. Anguo in Central Hebei and Fuping County in Northern Yue District are purchasing bones to manufacture bone fertilizer to supplement the shortage of fertilizer. In addition, for repairing agricultural implements, the state-owned coal and iron store in Yangquan, Central Shanxi, organized a large number of iron furnaces to manufacture agricultural implements. For the large hoe alone, more than 25,000 pieces have been ordered. There are currently 129 furnaces in the city that are rushing to manufacture various agricultural implements. Machangtun Village in Raoyang, Central Hebei, used thousands of kilograms of scrap iron to ask blacksmiths to make more than 100 hoes and shovels each, 250 sickles, and 50 plows.
    Secondly, sideline production, each region has different focuses on development according to different conditions. The textile industry in the plain areas of Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, and Southern Eastern Hebei has seen great recovery and development. In Southern Hebei District, 1.8 million spinning women have been mobilized, and 150 million square feet of military cloth have been completed by the end of December. According to statistics in Gaoyang, Anping, Qingyuan, and Anxin counties of Central Hebei District, there are 224,096 spinning women and 7,114 looms engaged in spinning and weaving. Luannan County in Eastern Hebei District has mobilized 2,660 looms and 4,924 spinning wheels, and 6,349 women are engaged in spinning and weaving. The recovery and development of native cloth weaving mainly relies on the economic support of the state. State-owned stores, promotion societies, and cooperatives in various places regularly purchase and sell native cloth in large quantities, and lend cotton and tools, so that the sideline production of farmers' weaving can be circulated. The promotion societies in various counties of Central Hebei District are expected to purchase 600,000 bolts of native cloth in December. With the liberation of large and medium-sized cities in the entire region and the development of the textile industry, the development of the rural native cloth weaving industry will make cotton feel increasingly scarce. This phenomenon has already occurred in Anping County, a cotton-producing area in Central Hebei. The textile industry in the county currently needs 34,389 jin of cotton, but the survey can only supply 16,286 jin, which is still a shortage of 18,103 jin, which is difficult to solve. In Xianxian area, the phenomenon of expensive cotton and cheap yarn has also been found. Especially in mountainous areas, there is a phenomenon of "expensive cotton and cheap cloth" in some markets. Therefore, the development of textiles should avoid blindness and should be developed in cotton-producing areas (mainly the Hebei Plain). In mountainous areas, due to the extremely clumsy weaving tools, low weaving technology, and the need to buy cotton from the plains, the result is expensive costs and poor quality, which is inevitably difficult to sell. Therefore, the textile industry should be developed in a planned and focused manner. The second is the fire nitrate industry, which has developed greatly in Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, and Taihang areas. According to incomplete statistics, in December, Southern Hebei has developed to 19 counties, reaching 52,000 nitrate miners, Central Hebei District has developed to 15 counties, about 1,500 nitrate miners, and Taihang District has developed to 9 counties, about 1,800 nitrate miners (most of which have been developed recently), an increase of one time compared with the spring of last year. Calculated at an income of five jin of rice per jin of nitrate, it is estimated that the entire region can enable nitrate miners to earn more than 16.5 million jin of rice per month. In addition, in Xinglong, Miyun, Zunhua and other places in the mountainous Eastern Hebei District, and Fuping, Xingtang, Laiyuan and other places in the Northern Yue District, sideline industries such as burning charcoal, weaving, making shoes, and transportation have been developed. Xinglong County in Eastern Hebei District has restored more than 280 charcoal kilns. Only four kilns burned 200,000 jin of charcoal, which can be exchanged for 200 shi of corn, solving the annual food problem for 100 people. Xitian Village earned more than 10,000 jin of grain by making gai mei zi (harrowing agricultural implements) with Vitex negundo, excluding the public grain. In the water areas of Baiyangdian in Central Hebei and Jining Lake in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, fishing has been carried out with government loans and assistance, and the livelihood problem has been solved. Disaster areas organize sideline production to overcome famine. In Jinghai, Wenxin and other areas of Central Hebei District, the government has loaned and assisted disaster victims in more than 20 kinds of sideline production, which has solved the lives of 15,558 households. In the flood-stricken area of ​​Xinglong County in Eastern Hebei District, in addition to organizing production, the Party and government organs and cadres called on the masses to accumulate 166,700 jin of dried vegetables to prevent the spring famine, and took the lead in practicing economy to overcome disasters and restore production.

　　华北十二月份农情
    【本报特讯】华北去年十二月份的农村生产，主要是大力进行今年大生产运动的准备工作，同时根据各地条件，从多方面发展副业生产。
    由于距今年的春耕季节为时不远。全区群众投入了兴修水利、增加牲畜、修置农具和积肥等大生产准备工作，除冀中、冀东、北岳、晋中等部分地区因支援前线未能与生产结合好，而受到影响之外，全区大部地区均获得很大成绩。在兴修水利方面，十二月份最后完成者，计有：晋中区修建了汾河两岸广惠、广济等九道渠及支渠数十道，可增加水田八十八万亩。北岳区完成了二十八道河渠的修建，可增加水田一万七千五百亩。冀中区建渠一道，可增加水田十二万三千亩，增加与修理水车数十辆，可增加水田八百五十四亩。太行修渠十一道。冀鲁豫区疏河三道，扩大耕地面积一万六千四百亩。获得上述成绩的原因，主要是由于华北各级党与政府的精心计划，大力扶助。尤其是晋中区结合支援前线，组织一批干部去发动群众修渠。具体扶助指导，解决了各种困难，消除了汾河上下游农民多年的纠纷，团结一致合力修渠，使阎匪统治下多年失修的汾河水利得以迅速修复。在修渠期间有计划的调剂了战勤，使修渠村庄暂少出民工，或不出民工。并动员组织了妇女儿童、老年等半劳动力，以工代赈吸收了非水利村的贫农参加修渠。保证了修建工程的及时完成。北狱区涞涿县也由于贯彻了发动群众，自力更生合作开渠，政府加以扶助的方法，提早完成了增加水田七千六百亩的计划。相反的如曲阳县荣臻渠的修建，由于干部缺乏组织发动群众的工作，事事依靠贷款，一切工程以贷款开支，群众把水渠看成官办，结果虽用了贷粮十一万斤，计划仍未完成。在保护繁殖牲畜方面：据各地调查，全区牲畜比战前减少百分之五十。特别是冀东区，由于蒋匪的摧残，减少更甚。该区一九四六年统计尚有牲畜四十余万头，去年则减为十六万七千六百九十头，每头牲畜负担一百至二百亩地的耕作。目前各地由于环境安定，地区联成一片，土改后群众生产情绪高涨，积蓄了买牲畜的资金，故各地牲畜，均在逐渐增加中。冀东区宝坻、玉田、遵化、丰润、芦台一带，公营商店，正带动群众往热河牲畜地区运土布换牲畜。据宝坻县八区统计：现已买回牲畜一百二十头。冀南区宁南县，十一月统计全县牲畜四千九百九十三头，十二月即增到五千零九十九头，太行区和顺县，十二月即增加驴骡四百二十六头，母牛四十头，种公畜七头。部分地区对增加牲畜进行了有效措施，太行和顺县过去为繁殖牲畜地区，冬季生产中，中共县委决定大力恢复繁殖牲畜，由中国人民银行县支行贷款三十万元（人民币，下同）用一十五万元扶植牧畜场养牛群，用四万元扶植养种畜，另外在全县确定十二个重点村发动群众以贷款吸收游资买牲畜，现已从晋西北河曲一带牲畜区购回牲畜两批一百十五头，都是一天卖完，群众仍自动集资去找县支行要带着去买，县联社社员也纷纷要求不分红去买牲畜，买回来先尽社员买。同时在政府扶助下，已在五个区设立了五个种畜交配站，一个牧畜场。冀南区振堂县特别注意了保护牲畜，召开了全县兽医，养种畜户座谈会，讨论了保护与繁殖牲畜的方法，组织了兽医参加中西医研究会，并规定在牲畜闹传染病时，可酌情减免其勤务，也帮助与鼓励了养种畜户，并在群众中宣传保护牲畜反对轻视兽医与养种畜户的封建观点。北岳区唐县则规定了奖励养种畜与母畜幼畜的免勤办法。相反如北岳区昌宛县推进社只盲目的贷款给农民买牲畜，不加以具体指导，只在本地买来卖去，并不能增加牲口，甚至有的浪费了牲畜贷款。又如太岳区高平县去年一月到十月全县即死牲畜三百二十头，其中往冀县运粮一趟即死牲畜六十二头，平时病死一百九十三头。该县五区刘家山，去年原有牲畜四十头，增加二十头，死了九头，死数占增加数的百分之四十一，证明群众极需保护牲畜的措施与知识。同时在冀中河间、献县一带仍有偷着宰杀耕畜的现象。以上经验教训，应引起严重注意。在积肥方面：在部分地区进行了具体的领导，根据当地自然条件调查研究了积肥的各种方法，加以推广。冀东区滦南县（新设县，滦县南部）推动全县增加厕所一千六百五十七个，猪圈一百零六个，挖沤粪坑一百二十个，增猪九百八十二口。滦县积肥现在每亩已达到十二驮，再努力积到春耕，每亩能达到十七驮以上，比往年施肥量增加六倍。冀南区清河县新增粪堆三千七百九十个。太行区长治县南天河村在劳动英雄曹林水领导下，准备每亩上粪九十担，现已积够上七百一十亩地的肥，还缺八百四十五亩的肥，他们正以熏土肥、挖坑土堆肥、榨油积油饼等方法争取春耕前完成计划。冀中区安国，北岳区阜平县推进社，正在收买骨头制造骨肥，以补充肥料不足。此外，即为修置农具，晋中阳泉公营煤铁商店，组织铁炉大批制造农具，仅大片锄一项，即定购下两万五千余张，现该市有一百二十九座炉，正在赶制各种农具中。冀中饶阳马长屯村，以几千斤废铁，请了铁匠制成锄、锨各百余张，镰二百五十张，犁五十张。
    其次是副业生产，各地区根据不同条件，有不同重点的发展。在冀南、冀中、冀东南部等平原地区的纺织业，有很大恢复与发展，冀南区发动纺妇即达一百八十万人，十二月底完成了一万五千万方尺军布，冀中区高阳、安平、清苑、安新等四县统计，即有纺妇二十二万四千零九十六人，织布机七千一百一十四张进行纺织。冀东区滦南县即动起机子二千六百六十架，纺车四千九百二十四架，参加纺织妇女达六千三百四十九人，土布纺织的恢复与发展，主要是依靠于国家经济的扶助，备地公营商店，推进社，合作社，经常大批的收购推销土布，贷出棉花和工具，使农民的纺织副业得以周转生产。冀中区各县推进社预计在十二月间将收购土布六十万匹。农村土布纺织业，伴随着全区大中城市的解放，纺织工业的发展，将使棉花愈感缺乏，目前冀中产棉区安平县已发生此种现象，全县纺织业目前即需三万四千三百八十九斤棉花，但调查仅能供给一万六千二百八十六斤，还差一万八千一百零三斤，很难解决。在献县一带也一度发现棉贵纱贱的现象。尤其是山地，有的集上有“花贵布贱”的现象，因此发展纺织应避免盲目性，应在产棉区（主要是河北平原）发展，而在山地，由于纺织工具极笨，纺织技术不高，又需到平原买棉花，结果成本贵、货色差，必然不易销售。因之应有计划的有重点的发展纺织业。第二是火硝业，在冀南、冀中、太行一带发展极大，据不完全统计，十二月间，冀南已发展到十九县，达五万二千硝民，冀中区发展到十五县，约一千五百硝民，太行区发展到九县约一千八百硝民（大部分是最近发展起来的），与去年春季相较增加一倍，以每斤硝收入五斤米计，估计全区可使硝民每月收入一千六百五十余万斤米。此外在山地的冀东区兴隆、密云、遵化等地。北岳区阜平、行唐、涞源等地，都开展了烧木炭、编织、做鞋、运销等副业。冀东区兴隆县即恢复木炭窑二百八十余座，仅四个窑即烧木炭二十万斤，可换玉米二百石，解决了百人全年吃粮。西天村打荆条编盖枚子（耙地农具）收入除缴了公粮，还赚万余斤粮食。在水区的冀中区白洋淀，冀鲁豫的济宁湖均已在政府贷款扶助下进行捕鱼，生活问题得到解决。灾区组织副业生产渡荒，在冀中区静海、文新一带政府贷款扶助了灾民二十余种副业生产，已解决了一万五千五百五十八户的生活。冀东区兴隆县水灾区，除组织生产外，该地党政机关，干部号召群众积蓄干菜达十六万六千七百斤，预防春荒，并以身作则带头进行节约，以战胜灾荒，恢复生产。
