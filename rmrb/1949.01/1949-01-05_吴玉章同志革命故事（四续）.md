Joining the Communist Party

　　The great October Revolution had an epoch-making influence on China. After this, the May Fourth Movement occurred in China. China's new democratic revolution began from then on. The Chinese proletariat stepped onto the political stage from then on. China produced the Communist Party, which was truly capable of liberating the Chinese people from then on.

　　In early 1919, Comrade Wu Yuzhang read a Japanese book on "Radicals" (the Japanese translation for Bolsheviks). He was very happy because this book solved three problems that he had not been able to solve for many years:

　　First, he felt that in China, only the farmers in the countryside were directly engaged in production, and most intellectuals and many other people in society were unwilling to work, resulting in many idlers in the cities. How could these people be eliminated? He often thought about it, but couldn't figure out a way. However, the Bolsheviks advocated "He who does not work shall not eat," which solved his problem.

　　Second, he often felt that China's bureaucratic politics were extremely corrupt. Since the Republic of China, the situation had worsened. Even if there were one or two good people, they could not change this political system. What could be done? He often thought about it, but couldn't figure out a way. However, the Bolsheviks advocated that the old political machine must be smashed and replaced with a new political machine in order to eliminate all filth, which also solved his problem.

　　Third, in 1903, he read Kotoku Shusui's "The Essence of Socialism" in Japan and was very fond of socialism. After the Xinhai Revolution, he and Li Shizeng and others were fond of Kropotkin's anarchism. After arriving in France, he became very interested in French cooperationism, believing it to be the path to socialism. So he often said to Li Shizeng: "We should establish a strong organization to implement it." Li Shizeng replied: "Anarchism does not require organization. It is enough to influence more people through education." He always doubted the effectiveness of this approach. However, the Bolsheviks wanted to organize a strong, fighting, proletarian party with revolutionary professionals to eliminate the old society and build a new society, which also solved his question of whether or not to have an organization to implement socialism.

　　In 1923, he and Comrade Yang Angong and more than twenty others secretly organized the "Chinese Youth Communist Party" in Sichuan, published "Red Heart Review," and organized labor unions and peasant associations. At that time, Sichuan was isolated from the outside world and did not know that the Chinese Communist Party had been established. In January 1925, he went to Beijing and met Comrade Zhao Shiyan, only to learn that the Chinese Communist Party already existed. He joined it. At the same time, he wrote to Sichuan, asking Comrade Yang Angong and others to dissolve the "Chinese Youth Communist Party" and join the Chinese Communist Party individually. At that time, some people could not accept it and advocated conditional merger, that is, the organization could not be completely dissolved and could still exist as a small group within the party. Comrade Wu Yuzhang firmly opposed this erroneous view. As a result, some did not join the Communist Party, but Comrade Yang Angong and others did.

　　Comrade Wu Yuzhang's firm stance was completely in line with the Leninist principles of party building. The Chinese Communist Party is the unified and supreme organization of the Chinese working class, and no form of small group should be allowed to exist within the party.

　　Founding the Sino-French School

　　After the Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924 following the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the face of the Chinese revolution was completely renewed. The May 30th Massacre broke out the following year, setting off a nationwide anti-imperialist upsurge and becoming the prelude to the Great Revolution. At that time, Comrade Wu Yuzhang was in Shanghai and had originally planned to go to Guangzhou, but in order to participate in this movement, he postponed his trip to Guangdong and founded a propaganda publication. In order to name it "Anti-Japanese Front," he engaged in ideological struggle with Dai Jitao because Dai advocated compromise with Japan and uniting with Japan to oppose Britain. Comrade Wu Yuzhang believed that it was okay to temporarily concentrate forces against Britain, but it was absolutely impossible to unite with Japan because Japanese imperialism was the mortal enemy of the Chinese nation and there was absolutely no room for compromise.

　　In the same year, Comrade Wu Yuzhang returned to Chongqing to establish the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters. This was the famous Lianhua Pond Party Headquarters during the Great Revolution.

　　Comrade Wu Yuzhang thought that the revolution needed cadres. So as soon as he arrived, he said to the people who were originally running the provincial party headquarters in Chongqing that a school should be established to train cadres. But they laughed at him: "Do you think running a school is an easy thing? We have wanted to do it for a long time but haven't been able to." Comrade Wu Yuzhang did not argue with them, but actually and actively proceeded with preparations. He was originally one of the initiators of the China-France Education Association, and at this time the China-France Education Association was planning to establish five Sino-French universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. This was perfect. So the school that Comrade Wu Yuzhang wanted to establish had a name: it was called the Sino-French School.

　　Then, people were sent out day and night to find a school site. A house was found in Daxi Gou.

　　What about the funding? When he returned from Guangzhou, the Kuomintang Central Committee gave him 1,000 yuan for party expenses, which he used for this purpose. Of course, it was not enough. He also took out his private shares in the Sichuan River Shipping Company, worth 1,500 taels of silver, for collateral. The interest on this stock was very high. It was pawned for more than 2,000 yuan, and he used it all for school expenses.

　　There was no worry about the source of students either. At that time, students in Jiangbei were having a strike, and some students were expelled. This revolutionary school took them in. So students from all over the place who were causing trouble came, and suddenly there were more than 200 people.

　　Because students were educated with revolutionary ideas, the atmosphere at the school was extremely active. Later, many cadres were indeed trained.

　　The school that people had wanted to run for a long time but could not, Comrade Wu Yuzhang established at once. He returned to Chongqing on August 15, 1925. The Sino-French School opened on September 4.

　　Preparing for the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang

　　Through the cadres who had previously engaged in the autonomy movement in Sichuan, Comrade Wu Yuzhang quickly established Kuomintang party headquarters in various important cities and counties in Sichuan. In November 1925, the entire province elected representatives to the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang, a total of six people, namely Comrade Wu Yuzhang, Huang Fusheng, Yang Angong, Tong Yongsheng, and Liao Huaping. They then set off for Guangzhou.

　　He initially thought that the journey was too far and he was late. After arriving, he found that very few representatives had arrived. Only five or six representatives from Hubei had arrived, including Comrades Dong Biwu, Xiang Zhongfa, Liu Fen, and Qian Jiebi; and twenty or thirty representatives from overseas, including Peng Zemin and Xu Suhun. Not only had representatives from other places not arrived, but they had not even been elected. Even the representatives from Guangdong had not been elected. Comrade Wu Yuzhang was very strange and asked what the reason was. Everyone said that they were afraid that the meeting could not be held. At that time, the Kuomintang Western Hills Conference faction was about to hold a congress in Shanghai to expel Kuomintang members from Guangdong from the party. Comrade Wu Yuzhang was very anxious, so he ran out to find Wang Jingwei, who was in charge of the Kuomintang Central Committee at the time, and asked them what they were doing. Wang also said that he was afraid that it could not be held. Because the meeting was postponed to January 1, 1926, which was less than a month away, Comrade Wu Yuzhang said: "If you can't hold it, you're finished." Wang said there was no way. Comrade Wu Yuzhang said: "How can there be no way! If you prepare quickly, there will be a way." So the Kuomintang Central Committee meeting was held to discuss it, and Comrade Wu Yuzhang was elected as the Secretary-General of the Congress, responsible for preparations.

　　Once Comrade Wu Yuzhang started the preparatory work, he worked actively, quickly, and intensively, sending telegrams to various places to quickly elect representatives and set a deadline for registration. As a result, on January 1, the congress was held as scheduled. A globe measuring one or two zhang was built outside the assembly hall. The meeting was conducted very enthusiastically. At that time, there were 200,000 to 300,000 workers on strike in Hong Kong and progressive masses in Guangdong, who often paraded and held meetings, and sang the Internationale at night, which could be heard from miles away. Among the more than 200 people in this congress, the left wing of the Kuomintang and the Communists accounted for the majority. Comrade Mao Zedong also participated in this meeting and was elected as an alternate member of the Central Executive Committee. Comrade Wu Yuzhang was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. The meeting lasted for more than 20 days, passed a declaration, and expelled the important figures of the Western Hills Conference faction.

　　A few days after the opening of the congress, Chiang Kai-shek returned from the Chao-Shan military operation to attend the meeting. A certain representative proposed that everyone stand up and pay tribute to Chiang. However, very few people stood up, which was quite embarrassing. After the meeting, the representatives scolded this person one after another, so that he dared not vote for Chiang in the subsequent election of central committee members. This also shows the democratic spirit in the congress at that time.

　　吴玉章同志革命故事（四续）
    何其芳
  　加入共产党
    伟大的十月革命对于中国起了划时代的影响。在这以后，中国发生了五四运动。中国新民主主义的革命从此开始。中国的无产阶级从此走上了政治舞台。中国从此产生了真正能够解放中国人民的共产党。
    一九一九年初，吴玉章同志读到了一本日文的“过激派”（日本对布尔塞维克的译名）。他非常高兴。因为这本书解决了他三个多年不能解决的问题：
    第一、他感到中国直接从事生产的只有乡村里的农民，一般知识分子和另外许多社会上的人都不愿劳动，结果都市里就有了很多游手好闲的人。如何能使这些人绝迹？他常常想，但想不出办法来。而布尔塞维克却主张“不工作，不得食”，这就解决了他的问题。
    第二、他又常常感到中国的官僚政治腐败到了极点。民国以来，情形更坏，即使有一、二好人也不能改变这种政治，这又怎么办？他常常想，也想不出办法来。而布尔塞维克却主张必须粉碎旧的政治机器，代以新的政治机器，才能铲除一切污秽，这也解决了他的问题。
    第三、一九○三年他在日本读了幸德秋水的“社会主义神髓”，非常欢喜社会主义。辛亥革命后，他和李石曾等都欢喜克鲁泡特金的无政府主义。到法国后，又对于法国的合作主义也很有兴趣，认为是到社会主义之路。于是他常和李石曾说：“我们应该成立一个强有力的组织来实行。”李石曾回答他：“无政府主义是不要组织的，只要从事教育方面多感化一些人就好了。”他总是怀疑这样作到底有什么成效。而布尔塞维克却要以革命职业家来组织坚强的、战斗的、无产阶级的党来消灭旧社会，建立新社会，这也就解决了他的到底实行社会主义要不要组织的疑问。
    一九二三年，他就和杨暗公同志等二十余人在四川秘密组织“中国青年共产党”，发行“赤心评论”，组织工会农会。当时因四川与外面隔绝，不知道中国共产党已经成立。一九二五年一月，他到北京，见到赵世炎同志，才知道已经有了中国共产党。他就加入了。同时他写信去四川，要杨暗公同志等把“中国青年共产党”取消，个别参加中国共产党。当时有的人还不能接受，主张合并也要　有条件的合并，即是说这个组织不能完全解散，还可在党内作为小团体而存在。吴玉章同志坚决反对这种错误意见。结果有的就并没有加入共产党，而杨暗公同志等却加入了。
    吴玉章同志的这种坚决是完全合乎列宁主义的建党原则的。中国共产党是中国工人阶级的统一的最高的组织，绝不能容许党内有任何形式的小团体存在。
    创办中法学校
    国共合作后，国民党于一九二四年改组，中国革命面目为之一新。次年五卅惨案暴发，掀起了全国反帝国主义的怒潮，成为大革命的前奏曲，当时吴玉章同志在上海，原已定赴广州，为了参加这一运动，即缓期赴粤，并创办宣传刊物，为了定名为“反日战线”，曾与戴季陶作思想斗争。因戴氏主张与日本妥协，联日以反英。吴玉章同志认为暂时集中力量对英固可，但万不能联日，因为日本帝国主义是中华民族的冤家对头，决无妥协之可言。
    是年吴玉章同志回重庆办国民党四川省党部。这就是大革命时候有名的莲化池党部。
    吴玉章同志想，革命要有干部。所以一到之后他就对原来在重庆办省党部的人说，应该办一个学校来培养干部。但是他们却笑他：“你以为办学校是容易的事情吗？我们很久想办都办不成。”吴玉章同志不和他们争论，却实际积极地去进行筹备。他原来是华法教育会的发起人之一，而这时华法教育会正计划在北平、上海、汉口、广州、重庆等地办五个中法大学。这正好。于是吴玉章同志要办的学校就有了名义：就叫中法学校。
    然后日夜派人寻觅校址。在大溪沟找到了房子。
    经费呢？从广州回来时，国民党中央曾给他一千块钱办党的费用，他就用上了这笔钱，当然还不够。他又把他私人在川江轮船公司的一千五百两银股票拿出来押当。这个股票利息很高，当了两千多块钱，他全部都用来作学校的经费了。
    学生的来源也不愁。当时江北学生正闹学潮，有些学生被开除。这个革命的学校就收容了他们。于是所有各地闹风潮的学生都来了，一下子就有两百多人。
    因为是用革命思想来教育学生，学校空气异常活跃。后来果然培养出了许多干部。
    人家很久想办都办不成的学校，吴玉章同志却一下就办起来了。他一九二五年八月十五日回到重庆。九月四日中法学校就开学。
    筹备国民党二次代表大会
    通过从前在四川进行自治运动的干部们，吴玉章同志很快把四川各重要市县的国民党党部也成立起来了。一九二五年十一月，全省即选出了出席国民党第二次全国代表大会的代表，一共六位，即吴玉章同志、黄复生、杨暗公、童庸生、廖划平等随即动身去广州。
    他初以为路程太远，已去晚了。到后，才发现代表到的还很少。只有湖北到了董必武同志、向忠发、刘芬、钱介碧等五六位；海外到了彭泽民、许苏魂等二三十位。其他地方代表不但未到，甚至连选出都还没有选出，连广东的代表都尚未选出。吴玉章同志很觉奇怪，问是什么缘故，大家说恐怕开不成会了。而当时国民党西山会议派正要在上海开代表大会，要把广东的国民党员开除党。吴玉章同志很为着急，就跑出找当时国民党中央的负责人汪精卫，问他们是怎么搞的。汪也说，恐怕开不成了。因会期延至一九二六年一月一日，距这时已不到一个月了，吴玉章同志说：“开不成，你们就完了。”汪说没有办法。吴玉章同志说：“怎么没办法！你们快些筹备就有办法了。”于是即开国民党中央会议讨论，吴玉章同志被推为大会秘书长，负责筹备。
    吴玉章同志一作起筹备工作来就积极，迅速、紧张地办公，打电报给各地，迅速选举代表，并限期报到。这样一来，到了一月一日。大会就如期举行了。会堂门外造了一个一二丈大的地球。会议进行得热烈得很。当时广东有省港罢工工人及进步群众二三十万人，常常游行开会，晚上唱国际歌，几里路远都听得见。而这个代表大会二百余人中，也是国民党左派和共产党人占大多数。毛泽东同志当时也参加了这个会，被选为候补中央执行委员。吴玉章同志被选为中央执行委员。会开了二十多天，通过了宣言，开除了西山会议派的重要分子。
    大会开幕几天后，蒋介石从潮汕军次归来出席会议，有某代表提议向蒋起立致敬。但起立者寥寥无几，颇为尴尬。会后，代表们纷纷责骂这个人，使他在后来投票选举中央委员时再不敢投蒋的票。这也可以看出当时大会中的民主精神。
