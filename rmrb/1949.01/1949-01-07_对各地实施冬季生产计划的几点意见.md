Some Suggestions on Implementing Winter Production Plans in Various Regions
　　Liu Huaiyu

In order to effectively prepare for the great production campaign next year and to more powerfully support the Chinese People's Liberation War, the leading organs in various parts of North China have formulated winter production plans and are in the process of implementing them. Judging from the plans of several special districts and more than a dozen counties, they have generally grasped several important tasks, specifically formulated effective methods to "lengthen production by an inch" on the existing basis, and put forward the slogan of turning "winter idleness into winter busyness." For example, they have put forward specific requirements for carrying out winter plowing, building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, breeding livestock, planting trees, afforestation, and other sideline production. Taihang Sixth Special District emphasized relying on cooperatives to organize various sideline handicraft production of the masses, and rectifying and developing cooperatives in the process of organizing production, vigorously carrying out the cooperative movement. This is a key to determining whether production is successful or not. Organizationally, it is determined that the county head should specifically lead the winter production work, and with the county head as the core, organize production organizations at all levels to form a leadership group. Beiyue and other regions rely on promoting the installation of waterwheels, purchasing sesame cakes, and manufacturing agricultural tools to solve the supply and marketing problems of the masses. Taihang Fourth Special District focuses on supporting the iron industry in Lingchuan and other productions in handicrafts. In order to avoid possible spring famine in the disaster areas next year and to solve the problem of grain shortage households this winter, all localities have determined that the disaster areas this winter should focus on production, combined with other work. Cixian County focuses the winter production on 21 severely affected areas. In order to solve the problem of more than 62,000 people lacking eight months of grain, Zhendang County first determined that villages that could not simultaneously carry out land reform and party rectification, accounting for nearly two-thirds or one-half, should focus on production, and mutually convert their work focus according to the progress of the work, and organize 36,000 spinning women and semi-spinning women to carry out a 100-day spinning and weaving campaign. These are all good and necessary measures. However, from the perspective of the entire plan, there are still several main problems that need to be studied:

    I. Organize and Give Play to the Strength of the Masses

    The most lacking in the plan is the organization and mobilization of the strength of the masses to realize the plan. Beiyue Fifth Special District and some counties, in the spirit of the entire plan, are implementing the solution of problems by relying on loans. For example, the Fifth Special District plans to build 2,004 new waterwheels, and proposes that if the higher authorities do not lend 15 billion border currency, it will be impossible to fully realize the plan. Of course, relying on a part of the loan is correct, but more important is to mobilize the strength of the masses, to mobilize the masses to order and repair; otherwise, relying solely on loans, the plan is in danger of failing. The lessons of past patronage and paternalism should be accepted. The requirement to organize must also be based on the voluntary and democratic basis of the masses. The Second District of Xingtang requires 80% of women to organize and collectively spin. It is necessary to prevent organizing for the sake of organizing, forming a collective spinning in form, which may affect production. Past experience has proved that not starting from reality often leads to results contrary to expectations. After the land reform, the means of production are relatively dispersed, and the masses are also eager to organize. In order to produce, the masses in Jingxing generally reflected: "We are not afraid of paying public grain, but we are afraid of having nothing to do in winter." They require us to organize them and find ways for them. If our plan today does not have a good organizational work and does not have a certain household and village plan as a basis, this plan will fall through. Our cooperatives, promotion societies, and mutual aid organizations among the masses in North China have a foundation. Leaders at all levels must carry out rectification and development on this foundation, solve the existing problems, and organize in areas with weak foundations to become the core organization for leading production.

    II. Strengthen Organizational Leadership and Clarify the Working Guidelines.

    This winter, the tasks of ending land reform, party rectification, building political power, and winter production must all be done well. Therefore, the work is relatively heavy. If there is no clear policy and good ideological leadership, and the organic combination of various tasks, it will cause one to lose sight of the other. Several years of experience have told us this. At present, there have been failed lessons of emphasizing the end of land reform and party rectification and neglecting production leadership, or turning the focus to production before land reform and party rectification have been done well. Therefore, it must be affirmed: in villages where land reform and party rectification are ending, land reform and party rectification are the center combined with production, and where the task in this regard is not large, the focus is on the leadership of production; where there is no land reform task, production is the center. Some counties put forward the end of land reform, party rectification, the establishment of political power, and winter production in parallel, without a center, which is impossible to do well in fact, and will only cause ideological confusion and distress among cadres, and the work will become laissez-faire. Some places can periodically carry out shock accumulation of fertilizer. Other counties neglect production: for example, Ji County divides the villages in the county into four types. Among them, villages where land reform has been thorough, the branch has no problems, or the problems are not serious, account for 69% of the 404 villages in the county. However, the leaders only arranged to end land reform in these villages, and did not see any measures to carry out winter production in these villages. Some party committees abandon leadership over production: for example, Cixian County handed over the leadership responsibility for unified leadership of winter sideline production to the county government office; Zhendang County determined that the director of the county government office should lead winter production, and pushed away the responsibilities that the party committee and the county head should bear. In order to complete the strategic task of "lengthening production by an inch," the party committee must manage and study production, especially since there are many new district and village cadres who lack experience, the party committee must give specific help and guidance to avoid distress in leading production. In certain specialized production undertakings, such as water conservancy, it is necessary to designate special personnel to be responsible and establish specialized organizations; within the village-level branch, it is necessary to make leading the masses to produce well as one of the criteria for inspecting the quality of the branch. On the other hand, it is necessary to grasp the leadership of labor heroes, so that they can take the lead in promoting production and become a bridge between them and the masses.

    III. Two Problems That Must Be Solved

    1.  Breeding livestock. This is a very important link in restoring and developing production. All localities should mobilize and support the masses to purchase breeding stock and vigorously carry out breeding. There should also be good organizational work in breeding, such as organizing breeding stock and female stock to go to the market, etc. Shiqiu Village, Third District, Yicheng, established a donkey breeding cooperative, which bred 54 heads in half a year, which should be promoted. Zhendang County has stipulated specific reward methods for breeding livestock: for each small animal bred, the reward from the female livestock household to the breeding stock household is determined by both parties themselves, and the government will reward the female livestock household with 16 jin of rice for each small animal produced. The breeding stock will be rewarded with 10 jin of rice per month for each breeding, and those who can breed more than 10 will be rewarded with 20 jin of rice for each additional breeding. Those who engage in breeding as a career will not be subject to miscellaneous service, etc., which are all relatively good. In breeding livestock, acute diseases should be prevented. For example, the conclusion of the production meeting of Beiyue Fifth Special District said: "The production plan made by Wanxian County in July will be completed in three years, which is not bad. Yixian County has not completed the breeding of livestock." This is all due to the plan being too large. At present, we must pay attention to solving the actual difficulties of existing livestock raising households, preventing the death and sale of livestock, and relatively increasing livestock. The death of livestock has been great in the past year, and veterinarians must be organized to treat them and eliminate infectious diseases. This winter, there is a shortage of grass for livestock in many places, especially in the plains. Some households have sold their livestock due to lack of grass. We must organize the masses to solve this difficulty from winter production, and strive for fairness and rationality in the issue of service.

    2.  Solve the supply and marketing problems in textile transportation: In the transportation industry, according to the survey in Taiyue District, cart pulling is profitable, iron-wheeled carts are average, and carrying by people is a loss; Jinnan District calculated that rubber-wheeled carts are the most profitable, iron-wheeled carts are average, and handcarts must be combined with their own operation. Transportation is even more difficult along highways and railways. Leaders in various localities must study how to open up transportation lines and solve transportation goods so that the masses can profit. The textile industry should focus on areas with flat land, conditions, and foundation, and provide good support to solve the difficulties of poor farmers in lacking raw materials and selling finished products. In general counties, different focuses should be determined according to the local sideline foundation, production raw materials, and production technology.

    It is hoped that all localities will review the existing plans and modify some inappropriate parts of the plan at any time in the practice process, and carry out the winter production campaign well.

　　对各地实施冬季生产
  　计划的几点意见
    柳槐玉
    华北各地领导机关为有效的给明年大生产运动做好准备，以更有力的支援中国人民的解放战争，都拟订了冬季生产计划，并正在实施中。现从几个专署和十余个县的计划来看，一般都抓住了几项重要工作，具体拟出在现有基础上使“生产长一寸”的有效办法，提出了变“冬闲为冬忙”的口号，如开展冬耕、兴修水利、积肥、繁殖牲畜、植树造林与其他副业生产，都提出了具体要求。太行六专强调依托合作社，组织群众的各种副业手工业生产，并在组织生产中整顿与发展合作社，大力开展合作运动，这是生产搞好与否的决定关键，组织上确定县长要专门领导好冬季生产工作，并以县长为核心，组织各级生产组织，形成领导集团。北岳等区依托推进社修置水车，购买麻饼，制造农具，解决群众的供销问题；太行四专在手工业上重点放在了扶持陵川的铁业等生产；为了避免在灾区明年可能到来的春荒和解决今冬缺粮户的问题，各地都确定今冬灾区以生产为中心，结合其他工作：成磁县将冬季生产重点放在二十一个重灾区；振堂县为了解决六万二千多人缺八个月粮的问题，把将近三分之二或二分之一不能同时进行土改整党的村，先确定以生产为中心，根据工作的进度互相转换其工作重心，并组织三万六千纺妇与半纺妇，开展百日纺织运动，这些都是好的、必要的措施。但从整个计划来看，还存在着几个主要问题，需提出研究：
    一、组织起来，发挥群众力量
    计划中最缺乏的是组织与发动群众力量来实现计划。北岳五专与某些县在整个计划的精神上，贯彻着依靠贷款解决问题：如五专计划新制两千零四辆水车，提出如上级给贷不到一百五十亿边币的款，就无法全部实现计划。当然依靠一部贷款是对的，但更重要的是发动群众力量，发动群众进行订购修复；否则单纯依靠贷款，计划即有落空的危险。以往恩赐包办的教训，应该接受。要求组织起来，也必须在群众自愿与民主的基础上去组织：行唐二区要求百分之八十的妇女组织起来，集体纺织，应防止为组织而组织，形成形式上的集体纺织，使生产反而受到影响。已往经验证明，不从实际出发，结果往往与愿望相反。土改以后，生产资料相对分散，群众也迫切要求组织起来；要求生产，井陉群众普遍反映：“不怕缴公粮，就怕冬天没活做。”要求我们去组织他们，为他们想办法。今天我们的计划如没有很好的组织工作，没有一定的户、村计划做基础，这个计划就落了空。为此，各地党政干部必须把发动群众与组织群众，成为实现生产计划的最重要的手段。我华北区合作社、推进社、群众中的互助组织，是有基础的，各级领导上必须在这个基础上去进行整顿与发展，解决其存在的问题，基础薄弱的地区进行组织，成为领导生产的核心组织。
    二、加强组织领导，明确工作方针。
    今冬结束土改、整党、建政、冬季生产的任务都要搞好，因而工作比较繁重，如没有明确的方针和很好的思想领导，和各个工作的有机结合，即会造成顾此失彼。几年来的经验都告诉我们这一点。目前已有强调结束土改与整党而忽视生产领导，或土改整党还没有搞好就将中心转向生产的失败教训。因此必须肯定：在结束土改与整党的村庄，以土改整党为中心结合生产，这方面任务不大的，即着重对生产的领导；没有土改任务的，即以生产为中心。某些县将结束土改、整党、建政与冬季生产并列提出，没有中心，事实上是不可能做好的，只会造成干部思想混乱、苦恼，工作走向自流。某些地方可以定期突击积肥。另有些县则忽视生产：如冀县将全县村庄分成四种类型，其中土改已彻底、支部没有问题、或问题不严重的村庄，占全县四百零四个村的百分之六十九，在这些村庄，领导上却只布置结束土改，看不见在这些村开展冬季生产的任何措施。有些党委对生产放弃领导：如成磁县将统一领导冬季副业生产的领导责任交给县政府办公室；振堂县确定县府秘书主任领导冬季生产，而推开党委与县长应负的责任。为完成“生产长一寸”的战略任务，党委必须经营研究生产，特别是区村新干部多，缺乏经验，党委必须给以具体的帮助与指导，使他们不致在领导生产中发生苦恼，在一定的专门生产事业上，如水利等，要确定专人负责，建立专门组织；在村级支部内，一定要把领导群众生产好坏作为检查支部好坏的标准之一。另方面要抓紧对劳动英雄的领导，使他们带头推动生产，成为他们与群众结合的桥梁。
    三、两个必须解决的问题
    一、繁殖牲畜。这是恢复与发展生产上很重要的一环，各地应发动与扶持群众购买种畜，大力进行繁殖。繁殖中也要有很好的组织工作，如组织种畜与母畜上集等。翼城三区石邱村成立了叫驴合作社，半年繁殖了五十四头，是应提倡的。振堂县在繁殖牲畜上规定了具体的奖励办法：每配一小畜，母畜户对种畜户报酬由双方自定，母畜户每产一小畜公家奖米十六斤。种畜每月配成一个奖米十斤，能配成十个以上者，多配成一个奖米二十斤。以配种为业者，人畜不支差等，都是比较好的。在繁殖牲畜上，应防止急性病，如北岳五专在生产会议结论中说：“完县七月份作的生产计划，三年完成也不错，易县的繁殖牲口没有完成”，这都是由于计划太大所致。目前要注意解决现有养畜户的实际困难，防止牲口的死亡与出卖，使牲口相对的增加。一年来牲口的死亡很大，必须组织兽医进行医治，杜绝传染病。今冬牲口缺草很多，特别在平原，有的户因缺草而将牲口卖掉，必须组织群众从冬季生产中解决这一困难，在服勤问题上也应求得公平合理。
    二、解决纺织运输中的供销问题：在运输事业上，据太岳区调查，车拉有利，铁轮车平常，人挑赔钱；冀南区计算：胶轮车最有利，铁轮车平常，手推车必须结合自己经营。在沿公路与铁路线上，运输业就更困难了。各地领导上必须研究打开运输线，解决运输品，使群众有利可图，纺织业重点应放在平原有条件有基础的地方，很好的进行扶持，解决贫苦农民缺乏原料和推销成品的困难。一般县份，均应根据当地副业基础、生产原料、生产技术等，确定不同的重点。
    希望各地将现有计划做一次审查，并在实践过程中随时修改计划上某些不适当的地方，很好开展冬季生产运动。
