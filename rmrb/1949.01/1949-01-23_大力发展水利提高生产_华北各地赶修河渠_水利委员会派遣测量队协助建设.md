Vigorously Develop Water Conservancy to Increase Production
　　North China Actively Repairs Rivers and Canals
　　Water Conservancy Commission Dispatches Survey Teams to Assist Construction

[Report from this newspaper] Due to the development of the situation, most of the rivers in the North China region have been liberated and urgently need repair. Furthermore, after the land reform, farmers are eager to develop water conservancy to increase production. To meet this urgent need, the North China Water Conservancy Commission dispatched four survey teams (more than 70 people) in October and November of last year to Yanbei, Jinzhong, Jinnan, Ji-Lu-Yu, and the Shijiazhuang-Tianjin Canal irrigation area to conduct on-site surveys and directly assist local water conservancy construction. It is reported that each team is working with a tense and serious attitude and has achieved considerable results. The Yanbei survey team went to Shanyin and Yingxian to conduct the Fushan water conservancy survey. They have completed the measurement of the 115-kilometer-long southern main canal and nearly 100 kilometers of six branch canals. They are now actively preparing materials, designing drawings, and calculating earthwork. The canal is planned to be completed in five years. After completion, it can irrigate 8,000 hectares of land, and this year it is planned to irrigate 600 hectares. The Shijiazhuang-Tianjin Canal irrigation canal survey team has now completed the earthwork for four branch canals and is currently designing bridges, sluices, aqueducts, and water intakes. This project uses the unfinished Shijiazhuang-Tianjin diversion canal built by the enemy as the main canal to irrigate the land on both sides. It is planned to be completed in two years, and after completion, it can irrigate 5,000 hectares. The Jinzhong survey team is currently conducting topographic surveys of the Tianyi, Guanjia Kou, Wanchun, and Wangcun canals in Yuci County. These canals need to be repaired due to excessive curvature of the canal lines and insufficient flow, which affects water use. After the repairs, a lot of waste can be reduced and more than 200 hectares of paddy fields can be added. The Jinnan survey team has now directly surveyed the notoriously difficult-to-manage Zhang River from Xuwancang (where the Zhang and Wei rivers meet) along the embankments on both sides to the Datieqiao (Great Iron Bridge) on the Pinghan Railway. A total of more than 220 kilometers have been surveyed on the north and south banks. The charts have now been prepared, providing a scientific basis for the future repair of the Zhang River embankment. The survey team has now moved to Ji-Lu-Yu to conduct measurement and investigation work.

　　大力发展水利提高生产
  　华北各地赶修河渠
    水利委员会派遣测量队协助建设
    【本报讯】由于形势的发展，华北区各河流已绝大部分解放，急待修整。又由于土改后农民迫切要求发展水利提高生产，为应此急需，华北水利委员会已派遣四个测量队（七十余人），先后于去年十、十一月间分赴雁北、晋中、冀南、冀鲁豫、石津运河灌溉渠等处，进行实地勘测，直接协助各地水利建设。据报各队均以紧张而严肃的态度进行工作，已获不小成绩。雁北测量队出发至山阴、应县，进行富山水利测量，已将一百一十五公里的南干渠及将近百公里的六道支渠，全部测量完竣，现正积极备料及设计制图，计算土方等。该渠计划五年完成，完成后可浇地八千顷，今年计划灌溉六百顷。石津运河灌溉渠测量队，现已完成四道支渠的土工，目前正在设计桥闸、渡槽、取水口等工程，该工程系利用敌人未完成的石津运导水路为干渠，灌溉两岸土地，计划二年完成，完成后可灌溉五千顷。晋中测量队，现正在榆次县进行天一、官甲口、万春、王村等四渠的地形测量，这些渠道因渠线弯曲太大，断流不足，影响使水，须得修整，修整后可减少很大浪费，增加水田二百余顷。冀南测量队，今已将素称难治的漳河自徐万仓起（漳、卫会流处）沿两岸堤线直测至平汉路大铁桥止，南北两岸共测二百二十余公里，现图表已作好，使漳河堤防在今后的修整上有了科学根据。该测量队已转去冀鲁豫进行测量调查工作。
