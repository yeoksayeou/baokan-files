To the Editor:

    Recently, I read Marx's "Wage Labour and Capital" (translated by Shen Zhiyuan, published by Shenghuo Bookstore). In the last paragraph of the final chapter, it says: "The more productive capital increases, the more division of labor and the application of machines expands. The more the division of labor and the application of machines expand, the more intense the competition among workers becomes, and their wages decrease further. ... Thus, we know that the rapid growth of capital causes an unparalleled rapid strengthening of competition among workers. In other words, it causes the increasingly relative reduction of the sources of wages and means of subsistence for the working class. Nevertheless, the rapid growth of capital is still the most favorable condition for wage labor." (Pages 50-51)
    I don't know what these most favorable conditions for wage labor refer to?
                                                        (Dong Ke, Qianjin Newspaper, Xingtai City)
    (Answer) Although the rapid growth of capital leads to the increasing impoverishment of the working class, it also promotes greater development of the productive forces. This will inevitably intensify competition among capitalists, lead to the bankruptcy of a large number of small and medium-sized bourgeoisies, and further impoverish the people's lives. Capitalism develops the production of commodities in a highly and blindly manner, but due to the poverty of the people, it cannot sell them, and as a result, it inevitably causes huge economic crises to erupt continuously, shaking the foundations of capitalist countries, and completely exposing the evils of capitalism, making the broad masses of working people increasingly revolutionary, and creating the preconditions for its demise. Moreover, precisely because of this, capitalists have to engage in the scramble for foreign markets in order to save their own crisis; this will inevitably lead to the arrival of imperialist wars. War causes unprecedented disasters and deaths to the broad masses of the people, but in another sense, it fundamentally shakes the foundation of the capitalist system. The "Program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" states: "... The disasters, calamities, and bankruptcy brought about by the imperialist war – all of this is bound to lead capitalism to bankruptcy and transition to the highest form of socio-economic system." The decline of countries such as Britain and France after World War II is a clear example of this.
    In addition to the inherent contradictions of capitalism, which become the objective preconditions for realizing socialism, at the same time, the working class, due to increased unemployment, reduced wages, and intensified oppression, rapidly deepens its understanding of the revolution, and its struggle against capitalism becomes increasingly acute. In the continuous struggle and tempering, its class consciousness is also increasingly improved. Moreover, due to large-scale machine production, workers in collective life greatly enhance their unity and organization. Stalin said: "The contradictions of capitalism have reached their extreme, and the proletarian revolution has become a direct practical problem. The period of the working class preparing for the revolution has passed."
    In addition, the high growth of capital also creates a material foundation for the new socialist society. These are all "the most favorable conditions for wage labor."
    Regarding economic issues, you can first read Leontief's "Fundamentals of Political Economy," and then read the original works of Marx and Engels from shallow to deep, as prescribed in the "Study Books for On-the-Job Cadres" by the North China Bureau, which will be more effective.
                                                                                    (Editor)

### 资本增长为什么对雇佣劳动有利？

　　资本增长为什么对雇佣劳动有利？编辑同志：
    最近我阅读马克思著的“雇佣劳动与资本”（沈志远译本，生活书店版），其最后一章末段中这样说：“生产资本越发增加，分工和机器的应用越发扩大。分工和机器的应用越扩大，工人们相互间的竞争就越强烈，他们的工资就越发减少了。……这样看来，我们知道：资本底急速增长，引起工人们相互间竞争之无比快速加强。换句话说：引起工人阶级底工资来源和生活资料之日益相对的减少。虽然如此，资本底急速增长对于雇佣劳动却还是最有利的条件。”（五○——五一页）
    这种对于雇佣劳动最有利的条件，不知道是指什么而言？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　（邢台市前进报董克）
    （答）资本的急速增长，虽然引起了工人阶级的日益贫穷化；但另一方面却促使了生产力更大的发展。这样，必使各资本家间竞争加剧，中小资产阶级大量破产，人民生活愈发贫困。资本主义高度而盲目地发展着商品的生产，但却因人民的贫苦无法销售，结果必不可避免地使巨大的经济危机不断爆发，震撼着资本主义国家的根基，以及完全地暴露了资本主义的弊害，使广大劳动群众日益革命化，造成了其覆亡的前提条件。并且，也正因为如此，资本家为了挽救其自身的危机，不得不从事国外市场的争夺；这样，又必然引起了帝国主义大战的到来。战争使广大的人民遭到空前的灾难与死亡，在另一意义上却又根本地动摇了资本主义制度的基础。“联共党纲”中说：“……由于帝国主义大战而来的惨祸，灾难和破产；——这一切都是必使资本主义陷于破产而过渡到最高形式的社会经济。”这如第二次世界大战后英法等国的衰落境况，便是一个明证。
    除了以上资本主义的内在矛盾，成为实现社会主义的客观前提外，与此同时，工人阶级由于失业增加，工资减少，压迫加重，迅速地加深了其对于革命的认识，其反抗资本主义的斗争便愈趋尖锐，在不断的斗争锻炼中，其阶级觉悟也愈发提高起来；并且，由于大规模的机器生产，工人们在集体的生活中，更大大地增强了其团结性与组织性。斯大林说：“资本主义的矛盾达到了极点，当时无产阶级革命已成了直接实践的问题，当时工人阶级准备革命的时期已经过去了。”
    此外，资本的高度增长，也给新的社会主义社会创造了物质的基础。这些，便都是“对于雇佣劳动却还是最有利的条件。”
    关于经济学的问题，可照华北局所规定“在职干部学习书目”先读里昂捷夫著的“政治经济学基础教程”，然后再读马恩原著由浅入深，收效较大。
