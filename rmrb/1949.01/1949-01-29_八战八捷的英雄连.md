　　The Heroic Company of Eight Battles, Eight Victories
    石磊
    Every comrade in the "Assault" Regiment's 7th Company is a tough man. They have successively completed eight "vanguard company" missions with unstoppable momentum. They have also used "nail tactics," always sticking to the enemy's front lines and depths. From 1947 to the present, over the past twenty-two months, they were the first to break through in battles at Shenshan on the Zhengtai Road, Shijiazhuang, Zhengding, Qingfengdian, Shijiazhuang on the Pinghan Road, Cuimazhuang and Wuqing in eastern Hebei, and recently in the battle for Dongguan, Xinbaoan on the Pinghan Road. Each time they fought so beautifully. Therefore, the heroic story of the 7th Company's eight battles and eight victories has spread throughout the army, and the entire 7th Company regards "Eight Battles, Eight Victories" as their supreme glory. This time, in the battle to annihilate the main force of the bandit Fu, the 35th Army, and seize Dongguan, Xinbaoan, before the battle began, the photography cadre took photos of the 7th Company, telling everyone: "After Dongguan is captured, each comrade who makes a meritorious contribution will have a photo taken." The Xinhua News Agency reporter also proposed before the team: "We guarantee that the victory of the 7th Company in Dongguan, Xinbaoan, and the heroic deeds of the past seven battles and seven victories will be reported, so that Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country will know of your victory!" This further inspired the heroes. They said loudly: "Good! We must annihilate the 35th Army!"
    The propaganda team brought a huge prize flag specially made by the brigade committee. On the bright red flag, the dazzling gold letters were arranged: "Open the Door to Victory." As soon as this happened, someone immediately composed a rhythmic clapper, excitedly singing loudly: "The flag is red, the words are yellow, large regular script written in the center, 'Open the Door to Victory' is written well, and there are small characters on both sides…" Third Platoon Leader Liu Baoli immediately took the flag and said: "Leave it to us, we'll take it down!" Squad Leader Yang Zeng of the Ninth Squad immediately became anxious and quickly said: "Our platoon guarantees to complete the task, give it to us!"
    The third platoon leader and the entire third platoon discussed requesting the vanguard platoon mission; the first platoon leader and the entire first platoon also discussed the same thing. Both platoons nominated their platoon leaders as representatives to go to the company headquarters to request the mission. As soon as the third platoon leader entered the company headquarters, he said: "It won't work if you don't let us attack this time! If you want to let the first platoon, our squad leaders will go to the first platoon to be soldiers and have to participate!" The first platoon leader heard this as soon as he walked into the yard and rushed into the room: "Instructor, the entire platoon's opinion is that we must be the vanguard platoon, and we will let the higher-ups deal with us if we don't complete the task." The third platoon leader got angry, arguing: "Choose two breakthrough points and see who fights better." "Right!" The first platoon leader replied very decisively. The instructor told them: "Prepare! Whoever prepares well will be called to fight; in addition, it depends on how the higher-ups decide." Only then did the two leave. Back in the platoon, the soldiers all surrounded them to ask for news. The two platoon leaders gave the same answer: Listen to the decision of the higher-ups. The third platoon leader added: "Even if we don't participate in the assault, we'll see you in the depths." Then, cadres and soldiers went deep to the enemy's front line to see the terrain, and their confidence grew stronger: "We guarantee few casualties and complete the task satisfactorily." They began practical exercises. As soon as the mountain guns and field guns fired, they watched as they destroyed four enemy bunkers. Liu Qingyun and Wang Guimin wanted to rush out of the trenches, but Zhang Haiying stopped them and ran to ask the platoon leader: "Is it time to start?!" Before he finished speaking, various cannons began suppression fire, the sound was like a strong wind whistling, and the smoke and dust swallowed Dongguan. Zhang Haiying returned to the position, and taking advantage of the slightly sparse artillery fire, began the charge. Squad Leader Ji Zhenrong of the third squad said to his soldiers: "As soon as Zhang Haiying's group advances, we will advance immediately." Zhang Haiying's group rushed to the enemy's front line. At one time, the Qiao Fu group, the Guo Haisheng group, the Ji Zhenrong group, etc., in front and rear triangles, also reached the enemy's front line. The enemy's position was filled with our combat groups. The third platoon was on the ground, and the first platoon was on the houses, striving forward. The second platoon and other units also fought in, and the battle of Dongguan ended victoriously.
    As soon as the battle ended, the headquarters called: "You fought very well and very decisively, but you have to defend it tonight, are you sure?" These words spread throughout the company. The victorious people immediately found the instructor: "Please tell the higher-ups, Instructor, that as long as there is one person left in the 7th Company, we guarantee that the position can be held!" At dawn the next day, the attacking troops quickly and smoothly entered the city along the streets of Dongguan.

　　八战八捷的英雄连
    石磊
    “突击”部七连全体伙伴，个个都是硬骨汉。他们曾以破竹之势，先后完成过八次“尖刀连”的任务；更以钉子战术，每次钉在敌人的前沿和纵深。自一九四七年至今，二十二个月当中，在正太路上的神山，平汉路上的十家町、正定、清风店、石家庄，冀东的崔马庄、武清，和最近平汉路上的新保安东关战斗中，都是首先突破，每次又都打的那末漂亮。因此在部队中流传着七连八战八捷的英雄故事，七连全体亦视“八战八捷”为他们的无尚光荣。这次该连在歼灭傅匪主力三十五军、夺取新保安东关的战斗中，战斗开始前，摄影干事就给七连拍过照，告诉大家说：“打下东关来，给立功的同志每人照一张。”新华社记者在队前也提出：“保证把七连在新保安东关的胜利，和过去七战七捷的英雄事迹报导出去，让毛主席和全国人民都知道你们的胜利！”这更激励了英雄们。他们大声说：“好！非歼灭三十五军不可！”
    宣传队带来了旅委特制的巨幅奖旗，鲜红的旗帜上，排列着耀目的金字：“打开胜利之门”。这一来马上就有人编出了快板，兴奋的大声唱着：“旗手红，字儿黄，清笔大楷写当央，打开胜利之门写的好，还有小字分两旁…………。”三排长刘保利一下把旗子拿过来说：“留下吧，我们包下啦！”九班长杨增站一看就急了，赶紧说：“我们排保证完成任务，给了我们吧！”
    三排长和三排的全体，讨论着请求尖刀排的任务；一排长和一排全体也同样讨论着，两个排都推选了自己排长为代表到连部去要求。三排长一进连部就说：“这次不让我们攻可不行！要让一排，我们班排长就到一排去当战士也得参加！”一排长刚走到院里听到这话，一闯就进了屋：“指导员，全排的意见，一定要当尖刀排，完不成任务随上级处理。”三排长冒了火，争执着：“选两个突破口，看谁打的好。”“对！”一排长回答的很干脆。指导员告诉他们说：“都准备一下！谁准备的好叫谁打；另外要看上级怎样决定。”两个人这才走去。回到了排里，战士们一见都围上来问消息。两个排长的答复是一样：听上级的决定。三排长多加了一句：“就是参加不上突击，到纵深再见。”接着干部、战士，都深入到敌人前沿看过地形，信心越强了：“保证伤亡少，圆满完成任务。”就开始了实际演习。山炮、野炮刚一叫，眼看着就摧垮了敌人四个地堡，刘庆云和王贵民就想冲出战壕去，张海英拦住了他俩，跑过去问排长：“该开始了吧？！”话没说完，各种炮就开始了制压射击，声音象刮大风一样呼呼的响，屑烟和尘土把东关吞没了。张海英返回阵地，趁着炮火稍稀疏的时机，开始了冲锋。三班长吉贞容对他的战士说：“张海英组一进，咱们马上就进。”张海英小组一突就到了敌人前沿，一时，乔福小组、郭海生小组、吉贞容小组等，分前后三角形，也到了敌人的前沿阵地，敌人的阵地前布满了我们的战斗组。三排在地上，一排在房上，鼓着劲向前突。二排和其他部队也打了进来，东关的战斗胜利结束了。
    战斗刚结束，司令部打来了电话：“你们打的很好、很干脆，但是今天晚上还要你们守，有把握吗？”这话传遍了全连，胜利的人们马上找了指导员：“请指导员告诉上级吧，七连只要有一个人在，保证阵地守得住！”第二天拂晓，攻城部队沿着东关的街道，迅速顺利地攻入城内。
