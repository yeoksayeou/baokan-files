　　Several Questions Concerning Filling Out Land Certificates
To the Editor:
　　We are working on issuing land certificates in Shangqingliang, Ninth District of Shexian County. We have some questions that we cannot resolve and would like you to answer.
　　1. Now that we have completed the general land measurement in the old liberated areas, some of the measurements are inaccurate. Now it is proposed to conduct sample measurements and assessments. However, the land certificate requires us to fill in the length, width, and breadth, but we do not have these figures from the past. How should we fill in these numbers?
　　2. When filling out the land certificate for houses and foundations, we need to fill in the length, width, breadth, and acreage, and also classify the type (such as multi-story buildings, single-story buildings, tile-roofed houses, cave dwellings). When measuring the foundation and filling out the form, should we fill in the length, width, breadth, and acreage under each category, or should we fill in the entire courtyard and house foundation of a household together?
　　3. Some people live in cave dwellings, where the land above the cave is owned by others, but the land below the cave is their own. The land above has already been registered under someone else's name. Should we fill in the length, width, breadth, and acreage of the foundation inside the cave?
　　4. For terraced fields and land with irregular terrain, how should we fill in the length, width, and breadth? Or should we only fill in the area calculated by multiplying the length and width of the land?

Hongyi Comrade:
　　Here are our answers to the four "land reform" related questions raised by your work group:
　　(1) When filling out the land certificate, you are asked to fill in the length, width, and breadth. This is according to the general practice. Because generally, flat land has length, width, and breadth in practice. If what you are referring to is "mountain slope land" that does not have length, width, and breadth in practice, and it was not clearly written in the previous measurement, so that it is still impossible to fill in the details now, then follow the previous practice: just fill in "mountain slope land" in the land and property type column, and do not fill in the length, width, and breadth columns. However, the acreage column must be filled in clearly. If there is length, width, and breadth in practice, it should be filled in clearly!
　　(2) According to Article 4 (A) of the "North China Region Land and Property Ownership Certificate Issuance and Filling Method": in principle, the household is the unit (that is, the foundation of all the houses in the household's entire courtyard is filled in together). However, if the household is willing to use the individual as the unit, then the individual is the unit (that is, the house foundation that the individual should receive is filled in on another ownership certificate). In short, it should be handled according to their own wishes. When filling in the type column, the standard should be the type of house with the largest quantity in all the houses. For example, a household or an individual has four rooms, three of which are tile-roofed houses and one is an adobe house; when filling in the form, it should be written as "tile-roofed house". And note in the remarks column: there is one "adobe house" inside. If, among the four rooms, two are "tile-roofed houses" and two are "adobe houses", see which one is complete and has a higher value. For example, although the two tile-roofed houses in these four rooms are covered with tiles, they have been damaged or are even about to collapse; they are far less valuable than the two newly built adobe houses. Then it should be filled in as "adobe house" in the type column, and it should be noted in the remarks column: there are two "tile-roofed houses" inside.
　　(3) Since the land above the cave belongs to others, there is no need to fill in the length, width, and acreage of the cave foundation; just fill in the number of cave rooms on the ownership certificate according to local practice, proving that they have ownership (it is better to indicate that there is no ownership of the foundation.)
　　(4) Terraced fields that do not have length, width, and breadth in practice do not need to be filled in. Terraced fields that have length, width, and breadth should be filled in; however, when encountering too fragmented terraced fields, depending on the situation, the length, width, and breadth of several connected terraced fields can be combined and filled in together. But this is for some convenience in the work, and do not be perfunctory because you are "afraid of trouble"!

### 有关填土地证的几个问题

专栏：询问与答复

　　有关填土地证的几个问题编辑同志：
    我们在涉县九区上清凉做发土地证工作，有些问题解决不了，想叫你们给答复一下。
    一、现在咱们老区土地已普丈过了，但是有部分不确实，现在提出叫抽丈、抽评，可是填土地证叫填长、横、阔，过去没有留下这个数目，怎样填这个数目呢？
    二、土地证填房子、地基，要填长、横、阔和亩数，还分种类（如楼房、平房、瓦房、窑房）。在丈量地基和填时，是否将各种类栏下都要填长、横、阔和亩数，还是一户将他全院和房子地基填在一块呢？
    三、有些群众住的窑房上边地是别人的，下边地是他自己的。上边已填在人家名下，那窑内的地基是否要填长横阔和亩数呢？
    四、梯田和地形不齐的土地，那怎样填长横阔呢？还是光填土地的长横相乘出来的丈数呢？
　　　　　　　　上清凉工作组鸿翼、麦存、竹廷　十二月十日鸿翼同志：你们工作组所提出的、四个有关“土改”的问题，我们的答复是这样：
    （一）填土地证时，叫你们填长、横、阔，这是按照一般的办法来说的。因为一般平原的土地，在习惯上都是有长、横、阔的，如果你们所指的，是习惯上没有长、横、阔的“山坡地”，从前丈量时没写清楚，以致现在抽丈时，还是无法填写的话，那就仍然按从前的习惯：只要在土地房产种类一栏中，填“山坡地”就可以了，长、横、阔一栏，也就不要再填了，但亩数一栏则必须填明，如果习惯上有长、横、阔的，就应填写清楚！
    （二）按“华北区土地房产所有证颁发填写办法”第四条（甲）之规定：原则上以户为单位（即将该户所有之全院房屋地基填在一起）。但该户愿以个人为单位时，就以个人为单位（即将个人应得之房屋地基，另填一张所有证）。总之，应以其自愿办理。填写种类一栏时，应以全部房屋中之数量多者为标准。例如某户或某人：有屋四间，三间是瓦房，一间是一坯房；在填写时便应写做“瓦房”。并另在备考栏注明：内有“坯房”一间。如果四间中，有两间是“瓦房”，有两间是“坯房”，应看看哪个完整，而且价值高。例如，这四间中，两间瓦房虽然是瓦盖的，但是已经破坏了，甚至快要倒坍了；远不如两间新修成的坯房的价值高。那就应在种类栏中填作“坯房”，并另在备考栏注明：内有“瓦房”二间。
    （三）窑上边的地既属于别人，窑的地基就不必填长、横和亩数；只要按照当地习惯，在所有证上填明窑洞间数，证明其有所有权（注明地基无所有权更好。）
    （四）习惯上无长、横、阔的梯田，便不必填。有长、横、阔的梯田，便应当填；但是遇着太零碎的梯田时，酌量情形，可以把相连的几块梯田的长、横、阔合并起来，填在一起。但这是为了工作方面的某些便利，而不要“怕麻烦”便敷衍过去！
