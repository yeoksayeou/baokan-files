Until Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are eliminated
We cannot relax for a single day

Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army:

\tFor the sake of liberating the people, liberating all of China, and liberating all the oppressed and exploited working masses of the world, so that society moves towards brightness, you are not afraid of all kinds of hardships in the freezing weather, on the long march, and engage in hand-to-hand combat with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Your great spirit makes the workers, peasants, merchants, students, and all good people in the liberated areas and the world send their condolences and respect to you.

\tWe must emulate and learn from your great spirit. You are actively killing the enemy on the front lines, and we are working hard to support the front in the rear, ensuring that you have no difficulties on the front lines, and also ensuring that your families have no difficulties. Now the enemies in North China are about to be completely liberated, and the liberation of all of China is not far away, with only a small area in South China remaining. Only about a year or so, the whole country can be completely liberated; but until Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are dead, we cannot relax for a single day. We hope you will work hard to complete the revolutionary task quickly, and we extend our sincere respect to you!

　　蒋匪一日没被消灭
  　我们一日不能松懈亲爱的解放军同志们：
    你们为了解放人民，解放全中国，解放全世界上被压迫欺榨的劳苦大众，使社会走向光明，你们在冰天雪地中，在万里的征途上不怕千辛万苦，与蒋匪作肉搏。你们的伟大精神使全解放区的工、农、商、学和全世界良善的人民都向你们慰问并致敬。
    对于你们伟大的精神，我们一定向你们看齐学习。你们在前线积极杀敌我们在后方努力支前，保证你们在前方没有困难，并且还保证你们的家庭也没有困难。现在华北敌人快完全解放了，全中华的解放也为期不远，只有华南一点小地方。只有一年左右全国就可完全得到解放；可是蒋匪一日不死，我们一日不能松懈，希望你们努力，很快的完成革命任务，向你们致恳切的敬礼！
