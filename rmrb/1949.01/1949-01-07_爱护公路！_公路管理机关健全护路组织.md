Criticism and Suggestions

　　Cherish the Highways!
  　Highway Management Authorities Strengthen Road Protection Organizations
    In order to support the national liberation war, the government issued directives last October to mobilize manpower and allocate huge sums of money to build highways. The Shijiazhuang-Handan Highway, totaling 360 li, was renovated with roadbeds and surfaces in early November, using more than 19,000 laborers. Food expenses alone cost 80,000 jin of millet; the construction of nine bridges and culverts cost 155,000 jin of millet. This is the blood and sweat of the people of North China. However, it is a pity that in less than a month, the entire road surface was crushed by iron-wheeled carts. To investigate the responsibility, the highway management authorities should bear the responsibility; however, the people and military and government agencies using iron-wheeled carts should also be criticized for not cherishing the highways. To this end, I suggest: first, the highway management authorities should urgently establish or strengthen road protection and maintenance organizations, strictly manage them, and pay special attention to road maintenance, earnestly fulfilling the responsibilities given by the people, and ensuring smooth traffic for vehicles. Second, the people and military and government agencies using iron-wheeled carts should cherish our highways from the perspective of cherishing the people, and everyone should jointly take responsibility so that vehicles can pass smoothly for a long time, so as to avoid the loss of manpower and financial resources.

　　爱护公路！
  　公路管理机关健全护路组织
    为支援全国解放战争，去年十月政府指令动员人力并拨巨款建筑公路。石邯公路计有三百六十华里，于十一月初，先后整理路基路面，使用人工一万九千余。火食一项开支，用了八万斤小米；修建桥涵九座，开支小米十五万五千斤。这是华北人民的血汗。但可惜不到一月，全部路面又被铁轮大车碾轧坏了。追究其责任，公路管理机关应负责任；不过使用铁轮大车的人民和军政机关，也应分受其不爱护公路之批评。为此我建议，第一、公路管理机关，急速建立或健全护路养路的组织机构，严格管理，特别要注重养路，确实执行人民所给予的责任；保证汽车畅行。第二、使用铁轮大车的人民和军政机关，应以爱护人民的观点，爱护我们的公路，大家共同负责，才能使汽车长期通行无阻，以免人力财力的损失。
