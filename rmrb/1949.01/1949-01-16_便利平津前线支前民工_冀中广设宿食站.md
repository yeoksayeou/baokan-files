　　[Central Hebei Electric] To provide food and lodging for civilian laborers supporting the Pingjin Front, many military lodging and food stations and guest houses have now been organized, greatly benefiting the civilian laborers. In Renqiu city and at the two private restaurants at Shimen Bridge, the government has provided 1,000 catties of rice to exclusively supply food and lodging for the civilian laborers passing through. Steamed cornbread and baked flatbread are already being prepared. The Xin'an town government and the state-run Taichang Restaurant have jointly organized two food and lodging stations for civilian laborers. Civilian laborers and cadres can get hot meals upon arrival, and grain and flour coupons are accepted. Using one meal's worth of coupons provides an excellent meal. Since its establishment, this station has been very popular with the civilian laborers. The Tenth Administrative Office has decided to build military-civilian food and lodging stations in Pingda Road, Shilipu, Gu'an, Liuquan, Niutuo, Nanmeng, Baxian, Xin'an and other places, organizing the masses to set them up themselves. The government will allocate grain to help as capital (interest-free loans to be withdrawn later). The counties and governments designated for these locations by the various districts are currently starting to organize.
　　[Central Hebei Pingjin Front Electric] In order to guarantee the supply of firewood and grass to the frontline troops, firewood and grass supply stations were established in various places on the western Tianjin front on the 22nd of last month. The stations are equipped with propaganda, receiving and dispatching, weighing, evaluation, food and lodging, and patrol and security departments. The station has organized a three-level evaluation committee (sub-district, county, and village cadres sending firewood) to conduct evaluations based on the principle of mutual benefit for both the village and the public. The humidity of the grass and the amount of soil it contains are assessed, and a discount is calculated. Ten vehicles are selected from each vehicle, weighed, and the number of catties is recorded. From that figure, the total number of catties can be calculated. In this way, only one weighing is needed per vehicle. Trial results showed minimal discrepancies. On the 29th, 120 vehicles of rough firewood from Baxian were cleared in three hours with two scales. This saved 80 to 90 percent of the manpower and time, reduced damage to the firewood and grass, and allowed the carters to complete the firewood delivery procedures quickly.

　　便利平津前线支前民工
  　冀中广设宿食站
    【冀中电】平津前线为供应支前民工的食宿，现已组织起多处军人宿食站与招待所，民工大感方便。任邱城内，石门桥的两家私营饭馆，政府借给米一千斤，专供来往民工吃食与住宿，现已蒸起窝窝头与烙饼。新镇政府与公营泰昌饭店出款组织了两个民工食宿站，民工、干部到站即可吃到热饭，并通用米面票，用一顿的粮票可吃的很好。该站自建立后，大受民工欢迎。十专署决定在平大路、十里铺、固安、柳泉、牛驼、南孟、霸县、新镇等地，建设军民食宿站，组织群众自己开设，政府拨粮帮助作为资金（无利借给以后抽回）。现各区指定地点之所属县、该政府，正在着手组织。
    【冀中平津前线电】为了保证前线部队的柴草供给，于上月二十二日在津西前线各地成立柴草供应站。站设组宣，收发，过秤，评议，食宿，巡保等股。站上组织了三级评议委员会（分区、县、与送柴村干）根据村与公家互不吃亏的原则，进行评议。在评草的湿度，带土的分量，算定折合，在每辆车上挑十个，过秤记下多少斤，见数就可折合出共有多少斤，这样一车过一秤就行了。试办结果，差数极小。在二十九号有霸县的百二十辆毛柴车，两杆秤三个钟头就收清了。节省了十分之八九的人力和时间，减少柴草的伤耗，使车夫很快的完成交柴手续。
