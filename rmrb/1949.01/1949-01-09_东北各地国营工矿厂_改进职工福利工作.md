　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th: State-owned factories and mines in Northeast China are actively strengthening employee welfare work. When the Northeast No. 1 Textile Factory was built last year, a clinic was established to provide free treatment for sick workers and maternity services for workers' families. Medical expenses are covered by the trade union's welfare fund. According to incomplete statistics from January to September of last year, the clinic treated more than 16,000 internal and surgical patients (each treatment counted as one person). Seriously ill patients are referred to municipal hospitals for recuperation, and wages are paid as usual. To improve the lives of employees, the factory also established an employee consumer cooperative to provide employees' families with affordable necessities. In addition to a portion of the capital coming from the welfare fund, the remainder is from employee shares. The total amount of shares has now reached 30 million Northeast currency. The factory has also established employee barbershops, warm water bathhouses, and employee nurseries. The trade union of the Northeast No. 4 Coal Mine District has established an orphanage to accommodate orphans left behind by coal mining deaths. The trade union withdraws a portion of the workers' social insurance funds and the mine bureau's subsidies each month as funding for the orphanage. All workers' orphans between the ages of six and fifteen can be admitted. More than a dozen orphans have been sent from various mines. Some factories and mines have begun to pilot labor insurance, providing appropriate relief and compensation to employees who suffer difficulties due to work-related injuries, death due to illness, or childbirth. The trade union of the Tonghua Erdaojiang Power Plant allocated more than 3.2 million Northeast currency last month as labor insurance subsidies. The trade union of the Northeast No. 1 Textile Factory provides some grain or coal relief to workers with no other labor force in their families who are unable to maintain their entire family's livelihood due to work-related injuries or illness; for families with special difficulties, it lends physical objects or cash, which is then deducted from wages according to the situation. For workers who sacrifice themselves on duty, the factory and the trade union jointly issue temporary bereavement payments and introduce their families to appropriate jobs. At the beginning of last winter, some workers in factories and mines had great difficulties with cotton clothing and accommodation. For example, in the Mashan Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province, only 16 percent of the entire mine initially had cotton clothing, but the mine's trade union, with the help of the mine, actively found ways to solve the problem, so that 73 percent of the entire mine's workers wore new cotton clothing. In addition, cultural and educational work for employees is also developing vigorously in various places. After the Northeast No. 1 Coal Mine District established an employee night school on the 20th of last month, the number of employees enrolled has reached 440. The Liu Mao Lead Mine in Heilongjiang Province organizes literacy classes, cultural classes, and political discussion meetings every night to educate workers. Each district in Mudanjiang City has generally established employee night schools, and the Federation of Trade Unions has established an employee night school study committee. In addition to establishing an employee night school, the Northeast No. 1 Textile Factory also runs a school for employees' children, which currently has 52 students. Education expenses and teachers' salaries are all provided by the factory and the trade union. The employee small library established by the Qiqihar Electric Power Bureau has spent about one percent of employee salaries on books and newspapers each month since August.

　　东北各地国营工矿厂
  　改进职工福利工作
    【新华社沈阳七日电】东北各地国营工厂矿山正积极加强职工福利工作。东北第一纺织厂去年修建工厂时即设立治疗所，免费为患病工友治疗，并为工友家属接产。医疗费由职工会福利基金负担。据去年一月至九月的不完全统计：该所共治疗内外科病人一万六千余人（每医治一次算一人）。对重病号则介绍至市立医院疗养，并照常发给工资。为了改善职工生活，该厂又设立了职工消费合作社供应了职工家庭以价格低廉的生活必需品。合作社资本除一部为福利基金外，余由职工入股。现股金总额已达东北币三千万元。该厂并设立了职工理发室、温水澡塘和职工托儿所等。东北第四煤矿区职工会为收容采煤死亡工友所遗下的孤儿，举办孤儿院一所，由职工会每月从工友社会保险金和矿务局补助金中抽出一部分作为该院经费。凡年龄在六岁以上和十五岁以下的工友孤儿都可以入院。现各矿已陆续送去孤儿十余名。部分工矿已开始试行劳动保险，对职工因公受伤或因疾病死亡或因生育而遭受困难者予以适当救济和抚恤。通化二道江发电厂职工会上月份已拨出三百廿余万元作劳动保险补助金。东北第一纺织厂职工会对家庭没有其他劳动力的工友，因公受伤或疾病以致不能维持全家生活时，就给予一部分粮食或煤炭救济；对家庭特别困难者借给实物或现款，以后由工资中按情扣还。对因公牺牲的工友，则由厂方和职工会共同发给临时抚恤金，并介绍其家属以适当工作。去年冬初某些工矿工友的棉衣和住宿曾发生很大困难，如合江省麻山煤矿，全矿最初只有百分之十六的人有棉衣，但该矿职工会在矿方帮助下，积极设法解决，使全矿百分之七十三的工友穿上了新棉衣。此外，各地职工文化教育工作也正蓬勃开展。东北第一煤矿区于上月二十日成立职工夜校后，入学职工已达四百四十名。合江省柳毛铅矿每晚组织识字班、文化课、政治讨论会等对工友进行教育。牡丹江市各区已普遍设立职工夜校，并由职工总会成立职工夜校学习委员会。东北第一纺织厂除设立职工夜校外，并举办职工子弟学校，现有学生五十二名。教育经费及教员薪俸全部由厂方与职工会供给。齐齐哈尔市电业局成立的员工小型图书室，八月份以来，每月书报费支出约等于员工薪俸的百分之一。
