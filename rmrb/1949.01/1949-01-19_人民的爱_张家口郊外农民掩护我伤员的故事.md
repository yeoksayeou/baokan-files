　　The People's Love
  　The Story of Farmers in the Suburbs of Zhangjiakou Sheltering My Wounded Soldiers
　　On November 29th, our army opened up Wanquan, completely annihilating the enemy guarding the city. We attracted the main force of the Fu bandit army from east of Zhangjiakou, and while withdrawing from the Huangtuliang position after completing our mission, the soldier Xing Maosheng was covering the rear and was shot and broke his left leg, losing consciousness.
　　When he woke up, night had fallen, and there was no sign of human habitation anywhere. The wind from outside the Great Wall blew, and the weeds on the hillside tapped his hands and face. He was hungry, his wound hurt, his throat was dry, and he couldn't stand up. He huddled in a low-lying slope and froze like this for three days and three nights. Early on the fourth morning, an old man carrying firewood walked by. When the old man saw him, he seemed startled, and when he recognized him as a soldier of the Liberation Army, he immediately threw down the firewood and ran away quickly. After a while, three people came up. The one in the lead was the old man, and the two behind were strong peasants. They quickly carried Xing Maosheng back to the village.
　　The news of Xing Maosheng quickly spread throughout Sujiaqiao Village, and people came to bring water and food. Before long, men, women, old and young, crowded a room. One person couldn't squeeze in and sent in a pot of boiling water through the crowd. From that day on, when the enemy wasn't in the village, people ran to the temple early in the morning, and at night someone sat guarding him. They didn't know when the enemy would come, so they anxiously went to deliver water and food, carrying steamed buns and white sugar in their arms. Some people were afraid he wouldn't be able to eat, so they found white flour. Some people saw that he didn't have a hat and gave him a felt hat to wear. Some farmers were afraid he was cold and asked their children to heat the kang for him. The old man Yuan Zili, who looked after the temple, stayed with him all day, bringing him stool and urine, and boiling water. Xing Maosheng said with emotion, "How can I repay your kindness? You treat me even better than my own parents." The villagers comforted him and said, "We've been looking forward to you for so long. Whatever we eat, you eat. Since Fu Zuoyi occupied Zhangjiakou, the land we were given has been taken back by the landlords, and we have to pay interest on the grain we were given. Now that you've come, we poor people will have food again. When Zhangjiakou is liberated, we'll be happy again." The words touched Maosheng's heart one by one. One day, four enemy cavalrymen came to the temple and asked Maosheng what unit he was from and how many people there were. They said they would kill him if he didn't tell them. At this time, the old man Yang Wancai came in and was shocked when he saw this. He shouted, "Those people at the bridgehead have all left. Why haven't you left yet?" The enemy hurriedly ran away. Day after day passed, and Maosheng and the villagers looked forward to their own army returning. They often sat together, quietly listening to the sound of the Liberation Army's artillery fire. When will they come? On December 7th, a group of enemy cavalry came to the village during the day. The villagers locked the temple door, and the enemy cavalry hurriedly ate a meal and ran away. That night, the Second Company of a certain unit of our army arrived in Sujiaqiao and found Xing Maosheng. When Maosheng was put on the stretcher, he said to the people in the village, "Uncle, Aunt, I'll come to see you again when I get better." The people replied, "Take good care of yourself! As long as our army comes, we'll have good days in the future."

  　张家口郊外农民掩护我伤员的故事
    十一月二十九日，我军打开万全，全部歼灭了守城敌人，把傅匪主力从张家口以东吸引过来，于任务完成后撤出黄土梁阵地时，战士邢茂生在后边掩护，被子弹打折了左腿，昏了过去。
    他苏醒过来的时候，夜幕已拉下来，四下里茫茫的没有人迹，塞外山风吹来，山坡上的野草敲打着他的手脸。他肚子饿、伤口痛、嗓子干，站不起来，他局缩在一个洼坡里，就这样冻了三天三夜。第四天清早，走来了一个挑柴老汉。老汉见了他，突然吃了一惊似的，等认出是解放军的时候，一下便甩开了柴，急急跑了。一会，上来了三个人，头里走的是原先那老汉，后面两个结实的庄稼人，他们迅速的把邢茂生背起回了村。
    邢茂生的消息很快传遍了苏家桥村，端水端饭的都来了。不大一会，男女老小挤了一屋子，有一个人挤不进去了，隔着人送进一壶开水。从这天起，敌人不在村里时，清早就有人往庙里跑，晚上有人守他坐着。他们不知敌人何时来，提心吊胆的去送水送饭，把饽饽、白糖揣在怀里。有人怕他吃不了饭，找来白面，有人见他没了帽子把毡帽给他戴上，有的农民怕他害冷，叫自己孩子给他烧炕，看庙的袁子礼老汉，整日守着他端屎、端尿、烧水。邢茂生感动的说：“我怎样报你们这个恩呢？真比亲生的爹娘待我还强。”老乡们安慰他说：“好容易把你们盼来了，有我们吃的就有你吃的。自从傅作义占了张家口，咱们分的地又叫地主要回去了，分的粮食要利钱，这回你们来了，咱穷人又有吃的了，打开张家口咱们就又享福了。”话一句一句的碰着茂生的心。一天，敌人四个骑兵到庙里来，问茂生是那部分的？有多少人？不说就打死。这时杨万才老汉进来，一看急了，便喊着说：“桥头上你们那几个人都走啦，你们怎么还不走呀？”敌人慌慌张张的便跑了。这样一天一天的过去，茂生和老乡每天盼着自己的军队回来。他们时常在一起坐着，静静的听着解放军的炮声。什么时候来呀？十二月七日，村里白天来了一股敌人骑兵，老乡们把庙门锁上，敌人骑兵匆匆吃了顿饭就跑了。晚上我军某部二连即到了苏家桥找着了邢茂生。茂生坐上担架临走时，向着村里人们说：“大伯、大娘，我好了再来看你们。”人们是这样回答：“你好好养吧！只要咱军队来了，往后就有好日子过了。”
