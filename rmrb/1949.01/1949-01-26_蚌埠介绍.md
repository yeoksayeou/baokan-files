　　Introduction to Bengbu
    Bengbu, a strategic point on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the first commercial city in northern Anhui, is located on the south bank of the Huai River, 360 li from both Nanjing and Xuzhou. It has a population of approximately 300,000. Transportation is convenient. In addition to the Bengshui (Shuijiahu) Railway connecting to the Huainan Railway, there are also the Benghuai (Yuanyuan), Bengshou (County), Bengchang (Huaiwei), and Benghe (Hefei) highways.
    Therefore, goods from eastern and northern Henan are collected and distributed here. Major factories include more than ten flour, match, leather, glass, and weaving factories, and electric light factories, as well as more than twenty larger tobacco companies, and nearly four thousand shops.

　　蚌埠介绍
    津浦路上战略要点和安徽北部第一个商业城市蚌埠，紧靠淮河南岸，南北距南京、徐州各三百六十里。人口约三十万。交通便利，除有蚌水（水家湖）铁路与淮南铁路相接外，尚有蚌怀（远）、蚌寿（县）、蚌长（淮卫）、蚌合（肥）等公路线。
    所以豫东、豫北的货物都在此集散。较大的工厂有面粉、火柴、皮革、玻璃、织布、电灯等厂十余家，及较大的烟草公司二十多家，商店近四千家。
