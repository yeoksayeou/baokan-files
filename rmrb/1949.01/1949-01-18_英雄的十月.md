Heroic October
    Hua Shan

	Historical Great Advance
    When the Northeast People's Liberation Army was heading towards the Beining Railway, we hadn't imagined that November 2nd would become the day the entire Northeast people were completely liberated. At the time, what we envisioned was an unprecedented decisive battle, a battle to thrust far from our rear, into the enemy's corridor, to sever the enemy's throat—completely destroying the connection between the enemy's Northeast and North China, in order to finally eliminate the Northeast Kuomintang bandit army.
    "Now things are completely turned around!" A heroic company commander from Sibaolimjiang told me: "The railways are ours, the artillery is ours, and the vehicles are ours; wherever we fight, the trains from Harbin follow us there." For a full half-month, troop-laden trains sped south, while outside the windows, the fields were still dusty and the engines roared; artillery units camouflaged with greenery, like rows of fast-running shade trees, swept past the infantry columns. On the banks of the Daling River, the barrier north of Jinzhou, dazzling lights like the streets of a night market stretched out of sight, illuminating the wilderness.
    From the Songhua River to the Daling River, it wasn't a short distance, but we knew that every step under our feet had been won back with blood and superhuman courage and resilience over the past two years. The thousand bravery medals of the entire regiment following the advancing vanguard were proof. "The new situation was fought for, and our glory was also fought for." The young regimental political commissar, summarizing their glorious record of eliminating 15,000 enemies over the past two years, said: "Now Chiang Kai-shek is about to be finished, but the enemies will never perish on their own; only by resolutely fighting on can we fight out even greater glory, and fight out a new situation for the final liberation of all of China!" This is the heartfelt wish of the people of the entire Northeast. A new Northeast soldier named An Dianqi was thusly exhorted by his mother when he went to war: "Now our family has food to eat, clothes to wear, and land to till, but don't forget the poor people of the world! Quickly defeat the Kuomintang and bring glory to your mother!" His own determination was just one sentence: "We won't let the enemy reach our doorstep anymore. My father is a model stretcher-bearer, and my mother is a model production worker, and I must strive to be a combat model!"
    The Mongolian grasslands were already withered, but the remaining veins of the Yanshan Mountains were still layers of green, the mottled jujube bushes along the way, the dense pear orchards, the wisteria climbing the walls, and the old men picking up manure along the village roads all gave everyone a feeling of joyful reunion after a long separation and exceptional encouragement. The soldiers in the march couldn't help but open their chests and sing: "Over one mountain, and another mountain, we're about to reach Shanhaiguan!"

    The Heroes of Tashan
    "Go to Jinzhou and take the test," this sentence became the fighting cry of the commanders and soldiers after the great training exercise. The most serious test began on October 8th. The defending enemy in Jinzhou suddenly increased from five and a half divisions to seven and a half divisions; the nine divisions of enemy reinforcements moving north from Jinxi were only half a day away, and the twelve elite American-equipped divisions that came out in full force from Shenyang were threatening our rear supply lines. This was Chiang Kai-shek's personally planned "decisive battle in the Northeast." Our troops bravely met this test. In the suburbs of Jinzhou, which had been plowed by artillery fire, one could see the sky over Tashan illuminated by colorful flares and signal flares every night, and hear clear artillery fire, but the attacking troops were still carrying out an unprecedented large-scale fortification preparation day and night without any hesitation: seizing outlying strongholds, transforming the terrain around the four suburbs, completing a series of ring-shaped communication networks and underground transportation trunk lines under the fire net, and pushing the starting point of the general attack close to the city walls. The soldiers always firmly believed: "The enemy reinforcements can't come. There are brother troops there!"
    The brother troops in Tashan were facing enemies only four hundred meters away. To the left was the sea, to the right was the mountain, and the narrow strip of land in the middle of ten or so li had no defenses to rely on, only a few villages. The enemy bombarded them day and night from the sea, from the mountaintops, and from the sky. A total of five thousand shells fell on the position every day. The village was destroyed from the ground up, and the fortifications were destroyed and rebuilt dozens of times. The ears of the commanders and soldiers were deafened and bleeding. But everyone still held on to their original position. A certain division commander of mine pointed to the scorched earth under his feet and said: "My position is here!"
    Day and night, the warriors resisted the enemy's relentless attacks of six divisions in rotation, with only one belief in their hearts: "Don't let the enemy advance a single step, and guarantee the smooth entry of the main force into Jinzhou!" The bunkers were collapsed by bombardment, so they moved to the trenches to fight; when the trenches were flattened, they jumped into the bomb craters to fight; when the bullets ran out, they fought with hand grenades; when the hand grenades ran out, they fought with stones; if they couldn't stop them head-on, they would thrust into the enemy's midst to fight. Some soldiers said: "Even if I die, I will stop the enemy!" Another immediately corrected him, saying: "How can you complete the task if you die? We have to find a way to live and fight to the end!" One of the soldiers' favorite methods was to eliminate the enemy with counter-attacks. The machine gun squad leader Ji Shoufa charged to the enemy's rear. When the whole squad was caught in the enemy's crossfire and their machine guns and rifles were broken, he seized the weapons from the enemy's hands and continued to fight. In the end, when he was the only one left with a single gun, he still drove the enemy back. On a protruding corner of the coast, the lone heroes annihilated ten times their number of enemies. In the almost completely destroyed Shangkanzi, the last to defeat an entire battalion of the enemy were four seriously wounded soldiers. Even when their hands could no longer use any weapons, the warriors continued to fight in the blood. Two disabled soldiers insisted on not being carried by others when they left the front line. The blind led the limping partner, and the partner with the broken leg pointed the way on his back. In order not to reduce the strength of killing the enemy on the position, they preferred to endure the torment of physical pain.
    "While there's breath, the position won't be lost!" This was the vow of the heroes of the Tashan troops. The enemy launched three general attacks in seven days and nights, with more than ten group charges of entire regiments and battalions every day. When the first echelon collapsed, the second echelon went up, and when the second echelon collapsed, the third echelon went up. But the people's soldiers still stood proudly in the artillery fire. The troops who were honored as the "Tashan Defense Hero Regiment" had more than 150 people awarded "Bravery Medals" on the spot on the front line; they fought the enemy until their blood flowed into rivers, and shot down hundreds of enemy corpses on an area of land that was only a hundred meters wide. Even though they paid a price of 7,000 casualties, the enemy, who still failed to advance a single step, finally brought out the officers' corps to charge; the enemy used machine guns to drive them from behind, and barely managed to drive two companies to within tens of meters of the front line, but as a result, they were pressed under the fire net by the Tashan heroes, unable to advance or retreat, and all surrendered. "The Jinxi blocking battle is the first contribution to the liberation of Jinzhou!" The commanders attacking Jinzhou said in unison. On this day when the Tashan troops completed the glorious example of the blocking battle, they captured Jinzhou with an astonishing speed of thirty-one hours, shocking China and foreign countries, and cut off the "lifeline of the Northeast" of the Chiang family dynasty in one fell swoop.

    The Decisive Blow
    For a week, the Jinzhou basin had been rolling with explosions and artillery fire day and night. Powerful field armies were pressing down from all directions. But when I stood on a high place, I could hardly see anyone within twenty li. The vast battlefield where hundreds of thousands of troops were gathered was a void. But at 11:00 a.m. on October 14th, earth-shattering artillery fire and a tide-like army suddenly erupted all at once.
    I walked along the lightning-shaped traffic trench towards the commanding heights of Beishan. Overhead, thousands of strange howls of artillery shells tearing through the air were heard. In the traffic trench, people roared and horses neighed, infantry artillery and ammunition trucks rolled forward, and demolition men squeezed into the hissing advancing ranks, cheering: "Hurry up, our 'big guys' are talking!" This was the nickname that the infantry specially gave to the heavy artillery pulled by those dedicated American ten-wheeled trucks. I suddenly remembered hearing such laughter in Siping. Last summer, thousands of large vehicles had trudged day and night for half a month, but the shells transported to the front line in Siping were only enough for ten minutes of bombardment. This spring, when I visited the Siping front line again, the transport of shells was already by trains and cars along the way. I watched with my own eyes as the deep bunker complex on the enemy defense line, no less than a thousand meters away, was bombarded into scorched earth by the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire within seven minutes. At that time, I heard someone from the follow-up troops rushing past me laughing and saying: "He deserves credit for this!" And now, not in Siping but in Jinzhou, the key town in the enemy's throat far from the rear, I heard the soldiers' laughter.
    The call for victorious liberation turned even new recruits who had just entered the battlefield into fearless warriors. The people of Jinzhou will never forget the name of the explosion hero Liang Ying. He charged alone to the front of a bunker on the alley battlefield in the northwest corner, and stuffed a demolition tube into the gun eyes where two heavy machine guns were firing outwards. Just as he was about to turn back and run out of the demolition blast radius, the enemy pushed the demolition tube out. The fuse on the iron tube was already sizzling and smoking, so he grabbed it and stuffed it back into the bunker, holding it firmly with both hands, refusing to let go. The company commander ordered him to turn back quickly, but he simply refused, saying: "If I go back, I won't be able to complete the task!" In order to blast open the road ahead, he generously perished together with the bunker. And outside the city, as soon as the news of the breakthrough was spread, the empty battlefield was immediately covered in black. I don't know where so many troops came from. Two columns, four columns, several units advancing shoulder to shoulder rushed from Beishan Highway to the breakthrough. Airplanes bombed and strafed overhead, and blocking artillery fire fell beside them, but no one in the ranks rushing into the city crawled down to hide. As soon as the machine gunner fell, the assistant grabbed his gun and continued to advance without even looking. The breakthrough was too crowded, so the follow-up troops simply climbed over the wall from Xiaobeimen, ignoring the landmines under their feet. "Don't be afraid of side fire, thrust in fiercely!" The enemy retreating to the station was frantically blocking in the carriages, but the vanguard squad had already chopped open the barbed wire with bayonets and drilled under the carriages, forcing the enemy to surrender. The assault company completely cleared the two hundred meter-long siding field defense line with more than thirty railroad tracks and piles of cargo and other obstacles in just fifteen minutes. The enemies in the bunker group were only concerned with blocking the front, but hand grenades exploded fiercely in the rear traffic trench. The enemies hurriedly scrambled back to the building, but the assault team attacked head-on from the rear window. The Eighth Company, which had once stormed the enemy's core fortifications in Siping, thus fought a seven-li street battle alone, seizing three core bunkers along the way, charging from the city wall to the city center, and finally charging to the enemy corps headquarters. Dozens of people, using a variety of captured submachine guns, launched a sudden attack and completed the task of the division to solve the enemy corps headquarters.
    The four armies that broke through the four cities at the same time were like four wedges inserted into the enemy's heart, and they all met in less than five hours, dividing the entire city's defenders into four major blocks. Each army along the way turned into countless sharp knives, only caring about flanking and fiercely inserting into the enemy's depth on both sides. The heroes rushed so fast that when they broke into the enemy's battalion command post, the guards in the room thought they were "their own people." The sudden appearance of the warriors frightened hundreds of enemies to kneel down and surrender, but no one could take care of them - "Don't want people or guns, advance quickly and bravely!" They gave a unique order: "Put the guns on the left, the people on the right, and walk out along the main street!" They made an explanation and continued to advance, fighting all over the city and stirring up the 100,000 defenders into a pot of porridge. The enemies in a few strongholds were completely trapped in an isolated and helpless situation, and those who did not surrender were all annihilated one by one.
    From the moment of Jinzhou's final liberation at 6:00 p.m. on the 15th, the Northeast Chiang bandits began to shake globally. Whether it was to delay the advance of Lin Biao's army or to withdraw troops back to their lairs to strengthen the defense of Central China, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary plans were all shattered with the fall of Jinzhou. The reason why Chiang Kai-shek desperately howled for a "north-south pincer attack" was precisely because once the Northeast People's Liberation Army freed this deadly iron fist from the Jinzhou battlefield, it would be doubly heavy no matter where it was punched.

    From Victory to Victory
    Along the Lijiache Station line on the Rao River, after two days and nights of bombardment by the enemy's four American-equipped divisions, the positions could no longer distinguish where the man-made fortifications were and where the shell craters were blown up by artillery fire. The scorched earth was still scorched earth when it was turned over, and the split tree roots were emitting flames. A company that stood firm in the sea of fire had only one heavy machine gun left, and the only remaining shooter of the machine gun squad, Shi Xueyi, had his right arm blown off by artillery fire the day before. The one-armed hero couldn't remember how many times the shells had buried him in the soil, but only knew that as soon as he woke up, he would struggle out of the soil and use his only left hand to shoot at the enemy charging up the position. He used the box gun left by the instructor to shoot, and the hand grenades on the position that had been blown off their wooden handles by artillery fire, and asked a new comrade to carry the American machine gun in front of him for him to shoot. In the end, he didn't even have the strength to hold the gun handle tightly, so he taught the new comrade how to shoot in a few minutes, and gave him instructions on the target while loading bullets, saying: "As long as there's someone breathing, the enemy won't be able to come up. Liao Yaoxiang, this old demon, has fallen into the net and can't think of slipping away again!"
    In this heroic October that swept the Beining Line, what order could be more encouraging than "Catch the enemy"? General Lin Biao said: "Don't let the enemy advance westward!" The "Heishan" troops blocked the enemy's fierce attack for two days and two nights on the position, and forced the Liao Corps to flee south overnight. General Lin Biao said: "Don't let the enemy flee south!" The "Rao River" troops thrust down from the northern line in one night and intercepted the enemy's fierce attack for two days and nights, finally causing the Liao Corps to fall into the People's Liberation Army's inescapable net.
    This was another major battle following the great victory in Jinzhou. After an unprecedented large-scale fortification battle, the fatigue of the main force can be imagined: as soon as the battle ended, the soldiers fell asleep on the battlefield, and the bombing all night failed to disturb their sweet dreams. But when the news that the enemy in western Liaoning was continuing to advance westward reached the army, the soldiers were so happy that they slapped their thighs and said: "Commander Lin has 'fished' out this 'big fish' Liao Yaoxiang!" From the 20th, the rolling army crossed the Daling River north again overnight and headed towards the designated location. The soldiers' feet were covered with blood blisters, and they said: "I'll crawl to keep up with the team!" The soldiers' ankles were as thick as earthenware pots, and they said: "I can't let the enemy go even if my legs break!" When they heard that the brother troops had already caught the enemy, the advancing ranks were simply boiling: "The time for the decisive battle has come!" The wounded soldiers on the stretchers couldn't lie still, and those with limping feet threw away their crutches; the pack horses couldn't keep up with the team, so the shooters carried the heavy machine guns; the small bridge couldn't accommodate the four columns, so they crossed the water; untying the leggings took too long, so they crossed in their padded trousers! The heroic troops who had crossed the south of the Yangtze River three times, the heroic troops who had defended Linjiang four times, and the brother troops who had swept the Liaohe Plain side by side last winter, all surged up from all directions. In the encirclement of fifty miles, Liao Corps, with nowhere to go, "Set up the artillery and bombard them fiercely!" The infantry had not yet deployed, and the artillery had already begun test firing, but the command post called and said: "Don't use artillery! The enemy is collapsing! Pursue them fiercely!" The troops could not be gathered together, so how many went up and how many went! Where there were more enemies, they would fight there! The heavy machine guns had just been set up and had to move forward again, so they simply put them on their shoulders to fight! "Pursue and thrust fiercely! Don't let the enemy breathe!" It was precisely where the Liao Corps had rampaged in the past that the flames of revenge for the final liquidation rose. The enemy's rearguard still wanted to resist, but the corps headquarters hiding in the core was overthrown by the People's Liberation Army. Liao Yaoxiang climbed into a jeep and drove to the headquarters of the New Sixth Army, and met Li Tao, who was also fleeing alone head-on. They joined forces and went to find the 22nd Division for help, but who knew that the three regiments of the enemy's "Tiger Might" troops had already "broken through" into the prisoner group! A unit that had thrust into the enemy's midst captured 25,000 "ace troops" alive with only a hundred or so casualties; another unit captured 16,000 live with dozens of casualties, and even staff officers who had lost contact on the battlefield captured an enemy cavalry brigade alive while riding in an empty car.
    The various People's Liberation Armies that completely annihilated the Liao Corps were spread all over the western Liaoning battlefield. The storm of the final liquidation had arrived. General Lin Biao ordered: all troops should immediately advance towards Shenyang via railway and highway!
    As a result, all kinds of road signs appeared on the side of the road: "Advance to Shenyang!" On the walls, on the doors, on the bridgeheads, a string of troop codes was written below: "Advance to Shenyang!" On the American howitzer pulled by ten large trucks was also written "March into Shenyang!"… On the road leading directly to Shenyang, the heroes of October launched a race towards victory. The "steel" troops running at the head were the heroes who first climbed the city of Yixian on October 1st. Immediately after the fierce battle to break through the northwest corner of Jinzhou, they marched rapidly for seven days and nights, traversed the western Liaoning battlefield, and on the day when the entire Liao Corps was wiped out, they waved their spears eastward. Finally, on the last day of October, they stormed the western line of Shenyang at a speed of seventy li in four hours, opening the door to victory for the "November 2nd" of the Northeast people.

　　英雄的十月
    华山
　　历史大进军
    当东北人民解放军的大军奔向北宁线的时候，我们还没有想到十一月二日将要成为全东北人民完全获得解放的日子。当时我们所想的是一场空前的决斗，是一场远离后方插到敌人的走廊去扭断敌人咽喉的决斗——彻底摧毁敌人东北与华北的联系，以便最后消灭东北国民党匪军。
    “现在完全翻过来了哪！”四保临江的一个英雄连长对我说：“铁路是咱们的，大炮是咱们的，汽车也是咱们的；咱们打到那里，哈尔滨的火车也跟到那里了。”整整半个月，满载人马的进军列车疾飞南下，而车窗外的原野依然尘土飞扬、马达轰响，伪装着绿丛的炮队，象一行行飞跑着的林荫，从步兵纵队旁边掠过。在大凌河边，这道锦州北面的屏障，耀眼的灯炬如同夜市的大街，望不到头，亮彻着原野。
    从松花江到大凌河，这并不是太近的距离，但我们知道脚下的每一步路，都是两年来用血和超人的勇敢和坚韧夺回的。我跟着前进的先头部队全团的一千多枚勇敢奖章便是证人。“新形势是打出来的，我们的光荣也是打出来的”。年轻的团政委总结他们两年来歼敌一万五千人的辉煌战绩时说：“现在蒋介石快完蛋了，但是敌人都永不会自己灭亡；只有坚决打下去，才能打出更大的光荣，打出最后全中国解放的新形势！”这是全东北人民的心声。一个名叫安殿启的东北新战士，出征时他的母亲就这样叮咛他说：“现在咱家有吃有穿有地种了，可别忘了天下穷人啊！快把国民党打倒，给为娘的增光！”他自己的决心也只是一句话：“守住家门口打不上敌人了。我父亲是担架模范，母亲是生产模范，我一定争取做个战斗模范！”
    蒙古草原已经枯衰了，燕山余脉还是层层翠色，沿途斑剥的枣丛，茂密的梨园，攀绕墙头的葛藤，沿村道上拾粪的老汉，无不给大家以久别重逢的愉快和异常的鼓舞，行进中的战士们忍不住敝开胸膛唱着：“走一山，又一山，眼看就到山海关！”
    塔山英雄们
    “到锦州过过考”，这句话成了大练兵以后指战员们的求战豪语。而最严重的考验就在十月八号开始了。锦州守敌从五个半师突然增至七个半师，从锦西向北增援的九个师敌人只隔半天路程，从沈阳倾巢而出的十二个精锐的美械师又威胁着我们的后方供应线。这是蒋介石亲自部署的“东北决战”。我们的部队勇敢地迎接了这个考验。在炮火犁遍了的锦州城郊，每晚都可以看到塔山上空照耀着虹彩缤纷的照明弹和信号弹，听到清淅的炮声，但攻城部队还是毫无顾虑地日夜进行着一个空前规模的攻坚准备工作：夺取外围要点，改造四郊地形，在火网下完成一系列的环城通信网和地下交通干线，把总攻击的出发地逼进城墙紧跟前。战士们始终坚信：“敌人援兵来不了。那里有兄弟部队！”
    而在塔山的兄弟部队，面对的只有四百米距离的敌人。左面是海，右面是山，中间十来里狭长地带并无险可守，只能依托几处村落。敌人从海上，从山头，从天空日夜轰击着，每天总有五千发炮弹落到阵地上，村庄从地面毁灭了，工事毁而复修者达数十次，指战员的耳朵震聋流血。但每个人仍坚持着自己的原来的阵地。我某师长指着脚下的焦土说：“我的阵地就在这里！”
    日日夜夜，勇士们抗击着敌人六个师的轮回猛攻，心中只有一个信念：“不让敌人前进一步，保证主力顺利攻入锦州！”地堡被轰坍了。转到壕沟里打；壕沟被轰平了，跳进弹坑打；子弹打光了用手榴弹打；手榴弹打光了用石头打；正面挡不住就插到敌人中间去打，有的战士说：“我死了也要挡住敌人！”另外一个马上纠正他说：“死了还能完成任务吗？我们要想办法活着打到底！”战士们最喜欢的一个办法，便是以反冲锋消灭敌人。冲到敌人屁股后面的机枪组长纪守法，当全组在敌人的夹击中，打的机枪步枪都坏了，他夺过敌人手中的武器还在打，最后只剩下他单人独枪，他还是把敌人打退了。在突出的海岸一角，独胆英雄们歼灭了十倍于己的敌人。在伤亡殆尽的上坎子，最后击溃整营敌人的是四个重彩号。那怕打到双手已经不能使用任何武器，勇士们仍然在血泊中继续作战。两个打残废了的战士，下火线时坚决不用旁人抬，打瞎了眼的把打断了腿的伙伴挡上，断腿的便在他的背上指路。为了不减少阵地上的杀敌力量，他们宁肯忍受着肉体痛苦的折磨。
    “有口气，阵地丢不了！”这就是塔山部队的英雄们的誓言。敌人在七昼夜发动了三次总攻，每天整团整营的集团冲锋不下十余次，一梯队垮了二梯队上，二梯队垮了三梯队上。而人民战士依然在炮火中傲然挺立。荣膺“塔山守备英雄团”的部队，当场在火线上挂上“勇敢奖章”的就有一百五十余人；他们打得敌人血水成流，在百来米宽的土上就搞下敌人几百条死尸。纵然付出了七千伤亡，但始终未能前进一步的敌人，最后连军官团也拿出来冲锋了；敌人用机枪在后面赶着，好容易把两个连赶到前沿几十米远，但结果被塔山英雄们按到火网底下，进不得，退不得，全部投降过来了。“锦西阻击战是解放锦州的第一功！”攻击锦州的指挥员们异口同声说。就在塔山部队完成阻击战的光辉战例的这一天，他们以三十一小时的惊人速度攻克锦州而轰动中外，把蒋家小王朝的“东北生命线”一举斩断了。
    致命的一击
    一周以来，锦州盆地日夜滚动着爆炸声和炮弹声。强大的野战兵团正从四面八方直逼城下。可是我站到高处，却在二十里以内简直看不到人，几十万大军云集的大战场是一片空虚。但在十月十四号上午十一时，天崩地裂一样的炮火和潮水一样的队伍就突然间一齐迸发了。
    我顺着闪电形的交通壕走向北山制高点，头顶上响着炮弹撕裂空气的千种怪啸，交通壕里，人吼马嘶，步兵炮和弹药车向前滚动，爆破手挤在嗖嗖前进的行列里欢呼着：“赶快上，咱们的‘大家伙头’发言了！”这是步兵专门给那些专用美国十轮大卡车拉着的重炮所起的绰号。我忽然想起在四平曾经听到过这样笑声。去年夏天，上千辆的大车日夜跋涉半个月，而运到四平前线的炮弹只够轰击十分钟。今春我再访四平前线，运送炮弹的已经是沿途列车和汽车了。我亲眼看着不下一千米远的敌人防线上的纵深地堡群，在七分钟内被解放军的炮火轰成一片焦土。就在那个时候，我听到从我身边冲上前去的后续部队有人笑着说：“可要立他一功了！”而此刻不是在四平而是在远离后方的敌人咽喉重镇锦州，我听到了战士们这样的笑声。
    胜利解放的召唤使得初上战场的新兵也变成无畏的勇士。锦州人民永远忘不了爆炸英雄梁英的名字。他在西北角巷战道路上单独冲到地堡跟前，把爆破筒塞进两挺重机枪正在向外射击的枪眼里。正要回身跑出爆破威力圈，敌人却把爆破筒推了出来。铁筒上的导火索已经吱吱冒烟，他一把抓过来又塞进地堡，用双手死死顶住不放，连长命令他赶快转回，他却干脆拒绝说：“回去就完成不了任务了！”为了炸开前进道路，他慷慨地和地堡同归于尽。而在城外，突破的捷报一经传出，空虚的战场，顿时黑压压的，也不知从那里冒出来这许多队伍，两路纵队，四路纵队，从北山公路上抢奔突破口的是好几个并肩滚滚前进的部队。飞机在头顶轰炸扫射，堵击的炮火落到身旁，而冲进城去的行列没有谁爬下隐蔽。机枪手刚刚栽倒，助手抢上去就捞过他的枪，一眼不看便继续前进。突破口挤不动了，后续部队干脆从小北门翻墙而入，不把脚下的地雷放在眼里。“不怕侧射，往里猛插！”退到车站的敌人正在车厢里疯狂堵击，先锋班已经用刺刀剁开铁丝网，钻到车厢下逼令敌人缴枪。横着三十几道铁轨和堆满了车皮等杂乱障碍物的二百米岔道场防线，突击连仅仅十五分钟就完全打通了。地堡群的敌人只顾封锁着正面，手榴弹却在后门交通壕猛炸起来，敌人紧忙夺路窜回楼房，突击队却从后窗迎头打来了。曾经在四平直捣敌人核心工事的第八连，就这样单独打了七里路的巷战，一路上连夺三座核心地堡，从城墙冲到市中心，最后冲到敌人兵团司令部的几十个人，又用沿途缴获的一色冲锋枪突然猛攻，完成了该师解决敌兵团部的任务。
    同时突破四城的四路大军，如同四把插进敌人心窝的楔子，不出五小时便全部会师，把全城守敌割裂成四大块。每路大军沿途又变成无数把尖刀，只管向两侧的敌人纵深迂回猛插。英雄们冲得这样快，以致闯进敌人营指挥所后，满屋守军还以为是“自己人”。骤然出现的勇士吓得敌人成百的跪下缴枪，可是谁也顾不上他们了——“不要人枪，迅速勇进！”他们别开生面的命令说：“枪放左边，人靠右边，顺大街往外走！”交代一声又继续前进，打遍全城，把十万守敌搅成一锅粥。少数强固要点的敌人。完全陷于孤立无援的绝境中，不投降的都一个个的被歼灭干净。
    从十五日下午六时锦州最后解放的时刻起，东北蒋匪开始全局动摇了，无论是迟滞林彪大军进军也好，收兵回巢加强华中防卫也好，蒋介石这些反动计划都随锦州的陷落而破灭。蒋介石之所以拚命嗥叫“南北夹击”正是因为东北人民解放军一旦从锦州战场腾出这支要命的铁拳，无论捶到那里都是加倍沉重的。
    从胜利奔向胜利
    在饶阳河边厉家车站一线，经过了敌人四个美械师两天一夜的轰击，阵地上已经分辨不出那里是人挖的工事，那里是炮掀的弹坑了。焦土翻过来还是焦土，劈裂的树根冒着火焰，硬挺在火海中的一个连队只剩一挺重机枪，而机枪班唯一剩下来的射手史学义，头一天就被炮火轰断了右臂。独臂英雄记不清炮弹把他埋到土里几次，只知道一苏醒便从土里挣扎出来，用仅有的一只左手射击冲上阵地的敌人。他用指导员遗留下来的匣子枪打，用阵地上被炮火炸断了木柄的手榴弹打，让一个新同志把美式机枪扛到跟前给他打。最后连紧握枪柄的力气也没有了，他又在几分钟内教会了新同志射击，自己在旁边一面装子弹，一面给他指示目标说：“有个喘气的，敌人就上不来。廖耀湘这条老魔落到网里再别想溜掉了！”
    在这席卷北宁线的英雄的十月，还有什么命令比“抓住敌人”更鼓舞人的呢？林彪将军说：“不让敌人西进！”“黑山”部队就在阵地上挡住了敌人两天两夜的猛攻，打得廖兵团连夜南逃。林彪将军说：“不让敌人南逃！”“饶阳河”部队就在一夜间从北线插下去，迎头截住了敌人两天一夜的猛攻，打得廖兵团终于掉进了人民解放军的天罗地网里。
    这是紧接着锦州大捷的又一个大会战。经过了空前大规模的攻坚战斗以后，主力部队的疲劳是可以想见的：战斗刚刚结束，战士们倒头在战场上就睡着了，整夜的轰炸也未能侵扰甜梦。但辽西敌人继续西进的消息传到军中，战士们乐的直拍大腿说：“廖耀湘这条‘大鱼’，可叫林司令员‘钓’出来啦！”从二十号起，滚滚大军又连夜北渡大凌河，奔向指定的地点。脚板走得打满血泡了，战士们说：“我爬也要跟上队伍！”脚脖子肿的瓦罐子粗，战士们说：“跑断腿也不能放走敌人！”猛听得兄弟部队已经把敌人抓住，进军行列简直沸腾起来：“决战的时候到啦！”担架上的彩号躺不住了，跛着脚的也把拐杖扔了；驮马跟不上队，射手就扛起重机枪走；小桥过不了四路纵队，淌水过；解绑带太耽误时间，穿着棉裤过！三下江南的英雄部队，四保临江的英雄部队，曾经在去冬并肩横扫辽河大平原的兄弟部队，都从四面八方潮涌上来了。方圆五十里的包围圈，走头无路的廖兵团，“架起炮猛揍啊！”步兵还未展开，炮兵已开始试射了，指挥所却来电话说：“不用打炮啦！敌人溃退啦！猛追啊！”队伍收不拢来，有多少上多少！那里敌人多就往那里打！重机枪刚架好又要前进，干脆架在肩头打！“猛追猛插！不让敌人喘息！”正是过去廖兵团横冲直撞的地方，腾起了总清算的复仇战火，敌人的后卫还要抵抗，躲在核心的兵团司令部却叫解放军戳翻了。廖耀湘爬上吉普军就往新六军军部开，半道上碰见李涛也是孤零零的迎面逃过来，他们搭上伙，又去找二十二师救命，谁知敌“虎威”部队的三个团早已分路“突围”到俘虏群里去了！插到敌人中间的一个部队仅仅伤亡百余人就活捉了二万五千个“王牌军”；另一部伤亡几十人就抓了一万六千个活的，甚至在战地失掉联络的参谋人员，坐着空汽车也活捉了敌人一个骑兵旅。
    全歼廖兵团的各路解放大军布满辽西战场，总清算的暴风雨已经来临，林彪将军下令：所有部队立即分由铁道、公路向沈阳进军！
    于是，马上道旁出现了各色各样的路标：“向沈阳前进！”在墙上、门上，在桥头堡垒上，一串串的部队代号底下写着：“向沈阳前进！”在十辆大卡车拉着的美式榴弹炮上也写着“向沈阳挺进！”……直通沈阳的大道上，十月的英雄们展开了奔向胜利的赛跑。而跑在头里的“钢铁”部队，正是在十月一日首先登上义县城头的英雄，他们紧接着突破锦州西北角的激战之后，又以七昼夜的急行军纵横辽西战场，在廖兵团全军覆没的当天，挥戈东向，终于在十月的最后一天，以四小时七十里的速度直捣沈阳西线，为东北人民的“十一月二日”打开了胜利的大门。
