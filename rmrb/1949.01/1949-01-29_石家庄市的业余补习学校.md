　　Shijiazhuang City's Evening Remedial Schools
    Shu Ping　Liu Jian
    The Shijiazhuang City Evening Remedial School was established in mid-August of last year. Before its establishment, after several suggestions from citizens, we studied the experience of the "Evening Public School" in Zhangjiakou, and also consulted the people's schools and study groups run by several street governments in the city. Therefore, we decided to establish "Evening Remedial Schools."
    At the beginning, since workers already had factory education, it was decided to target shop assistants, merchants, peddlers, and old intellectuals. At this time, we did not pay attention to the learning needs of urban handicraft workers and the children of newly liberated peasants in the suburbs. In order to make teaching better suited to the needs of the masses, a survey discussion meeting of 47 citizens was held first. Everyone advocated starting school immediately after preparations were completed. Regarding study time, half favored studying every other day, and half favored studying every day. The study content was commercial bookkeeping, mathematics (algebra, arithmetic), general knowledge of politics, and Chinese language. Some people also suggested learning English. As for books and lecture notes, it was proposed to be self-provided, and no one expressed any difficulty, which is different from the countryside.
    Next was the enrollment examination. Four methods were used for publicity: newspapers, blackboards, large-character posters, and broadcasting. Within three days, 123 people registered.
    It should be pointed out that most of the student registrations at this time were after mobilization, and some streets and neighborhoods even experienced the phenomenon of forced recruitment. Therefore, some students registered but did not take the exam, or passed the exam but did not come. Generally speaking, citizens did not pay much attention to learning issues at this time.
    After the start of school, the number of students gradually increased to 309. According to a statistic of 151 people, 132 were male and 19 were female. The majority were between 15 and 20 years old, accounting for 55%. The cultural level was much higher than that of farmers. Those with elementary school education accounted for 6%, those with higher elementary school education accounted for 63.5%, those with junior high school education accounted for 27%, and those with education above junior high school accounted for 3.5%. The majority were from the business community, including apprentices, shop assistants, trainees, accountants, shopkeepers, and small merchants, accounting for 51% in total. Workers accounted for 15%, cadres accounted for 5%, farmers accounted for 10%, students accounted for 4%, and others accounted for 5%. Precisely because there were many merchants, coupled with some general affairs and accounting personnel among the cadres, everyone was willing to learn bookkeeping. There were also those who studied for the purpose of finding a job or improving their cultural level.
    After the start of school, due to the enemy's large-scale bombing and the leadership's failure to pay attention to teachers' lectures, material equipment, and the establishment of a system to strengthen standardization, a loose phenomenon occurred for a time, and leadership was lost. Coupled with the "change of heaven" thinking of some people, students came less and less each day. At the lowest point, there were less than a hundred people. At that time, the evening remedial school seemed to be on the verge of collapse, which gave the masses a bad impression.
    The creation of this situation, in terms of school leadership, demonstrated an attitude of "routine bureaucraticism." Although the school负责人 were present at each class, they did not know the number of students, and their work was not in-depth, so they could not inspire the students. On the other hand, they only catered to the opinions of the students, neglecting their own initiative, and as a result, became the tail of the students. In terms of teachers, the worst thing was the frequent phenomenon of absenteeism. Students came from afar (some students lived in rural villages more than ten or twenty li away), but the teacher was not there, and no one replaced him; they made a wasted trip, and then they became discouraged. The second was the issue of teaching methods and teaching content. The students' requests: for bookkeeping, they hoped to be taught clearly and understandably; for politics, they hoped to be taught in a way that was relevant to them, and they opposed randomly grabbing at things and welcomed systematic teaching. However, the students' requests could not be met. Regarding the students themselves, there were also some who specialized in "guerrilla warfare." One type believed that this school did not have a social status, and certificates did not matter. At the same time, they believed that the school could not truly solve the problem of employment, so they did not come. Another type was: anyway, you have to issue me a certificate at the end, so they were careless and did not take learning seriously, and did not come to school regularly. In addition, a very small number of people left the city.
    After the leading comrades seriously understood the situation, they decided to reorganize the management and teaching methods, and explained the necessity of the reorganization to the students, soliciting their opinions. After four or five days of brewing, the school issued a formal notice, limiting the students to register within four days. The school would then review them. And announced the following rules: (1) If a student is absent without reason, and is absent three times (bookkeeping class) or five times (politics class), their parents will be notified immediately (shop assistants will notify their managers, and cadres will notify their organizations). A certificate will not be issued at graduation. (2) If a student asks for leave due to an incident, but the absence exceeds one-third of the total study time, a certificate will also not be issued. (3) Strict attendance will be implemented. As a result, 51 people registered for the bookkeeping class and 26 people registered for the politics class. This time, the students' learning enthusiasm began to turn stable. Except for the occasional individual who asked for leave due to an incident or illness, there was no one who was absent without reason. At the same time, the bookkeeping class requested to increase two more sessions (four hours) of arithmetic. The bookkeeping and arithmetic exercise books were handed in very quickly, which indeed showed a kind of vitality. Later, although the bandit Fu disturbed the city and some students left the city, which had some impact, it was generally said to be much more developed than in the past.
    Now, there are five cultural classes in the evening remedial school, with a total of 278 students. The composition of the students has also changed. According to the statistics of the first and second cultural classes, out of 70 people, 14 were workers, accounting for 20%, and 15 were farmers, accounting for 21% (the above two increased from 25% to 41%). 8 were cadres, accounting for 11%, 5 were students, accounting for 7%, 6 were unemployed, accounting for 9%, 17 were from the business community, accounting for 24%, and 5 were others, accounting for 7%. According to the statistics of the third and fourth classes, workers and peasants accounted for 41%, while merchants were further reduced to 14%, and the number of female students also increased from 11% to 24%. This change in composition shows that the school is closer to the grassroots masses in the city. According to the comparison of ages, we found that the proportion of young people in the third batch of new students has also increased (from 86% to 93%), which gives us a good opportunity to carry out youth work!
    The mobility of students in remedial schools is much greater than that in regular schools. But why have we gradually stabilized it? There are several reasons: (1) The work of the teachers has improved. The teachers of the cultural classes have almost never missed a single class, and they have taught more clearly. The students can "get something" and "be retained when they come." (2) Contact with the masses has begun. Some organs and street district governments wrote letters to our school to introduce students. (3) A regular system has been established. This is liked by the vast majority of students in the school. According to their requirements, we have established attendance, leave, and reward and punishment systems as much as possible. We also immediately publicly commended the model students who are active in learning, do not ask for leave, or ask for less leave, and organized student unions in each class, divided into groups by region, to convey and implement the tasks of the whole class, and strengthen connections. (4) It is the demand for culture from the children of newly liberated peasants.
    Now the students' learning interest is quite high. The courses of the cultural classes are generally scheduled for two hours every night from Monday to Saturday, but the students are still not satisfied. Some propose to study for three hours every night, and some even advocate classes during the day. In order to take care of the students with higher levels, we have recently established an algebra class; in order to care for those with lower levels who cannot keep up, we have also established a supplementary class (added outside the formal homework), satisfying the requirements of some students. A graduate of the bookkeeping class wrote: The school "has higher hopes for us, it overcomes all difficulties, is not afraid of hardship, and thinks for the students."
    At present, we can say this: the foundation of the evening remedial school has been laid. But what should be considered is how to continue to further deepen the work.
    In these four months of work, a lot of experience has been gained.
    First, the learning requirements of urban citizens and the learning requirements of peasants in the suburbs are somewhat different in certain respects. The significant characteristics are: One, the peasants in the suburbs demand learning in order to prepare for coming to the city in the future, such as doing business, finding work, or furthering their education, etc., which is close to ideal, so the demand for immediate knowledge and use is not so urgent, and it is easier to forgive if the teacher teaches a little worse. The urban citizens' viewpoint of learning is the opposite. It is realistic, they want to learn and use it immediately, and it must be practical, so the requirements for teachers are relatively high. It is unacceptable if the teacher does not teach well! (Three) The peasants showed loose habits, and it did not matter whether it was formal or not. Citizens are not like this, they must establish a system, improve material equipment, oppose loose habits, and like standardization. (Four) Because there are many clan connections in the countryside, the lives of the peasants are relatively close, so it is completely applicable and necessary to find activists in this middle to play a leading role. The city is different, they are a group gathered from different hometowns, different classes, and different occupations, connected through the market (commodity exchange) relationship. Generally, no one cares about anyone else, and there are very few clan connections. Therefore, it is impossible to find activists to play a leading role for a while. Of course, this does not completely negate the role of activists. It is necessary to appropriately establish student organizations, hold get-togethers, and strengthen connections in order to be effective.
    Second, there are also differences between remedial schools and regular schools. Remedial schools are more social than regular schools because they directly include employed youth and adults, so the mobility is also greater. Also, because their cultural level is low and their political awareness is not high, establishing feelings and making friends is the best way to contact them. It is necessary to hold get-togethers and home visits. Therefore, on the one hand, remedial schools should be as standardized as possible, and on the other hand, they should also be appropriately socialized. Both types of properties must be appropriately used in order to promote social education work.
    Third, urban evening remedial schools are also the best way to contact the masses and mobilize the masses. Through them, the party's policies can be publicized and the masses' awareness can be raised.
    Fourth, popular remedial education is a transitional education for the masses to prepare for employment, further education, or improve their professional skills. Therefore, it should be a diverse, broad, and timely education. To be more specific, popular remedial education should set up various training classes and cultural classes on improving professional skills, and must be linked to their current requirements in order to seek development.

　　石家庄市的业余补习学校
    舒平　刘见
    石家庄市业余补习学校是去年八月中旬创办的。开办前经市民几次建议，我们曾研究了过去张家口“业余公学”的经验，又参考本市若干街政府所办的民校和学习小组，于是我们决定了办“业余补习学校”。
    开始时，因为工人已有工厂教育，便决定以店员、商人、摊贩及旧知识分子为办学对象。这时，我们并没有注意到市区手工业工人及近郊新翻身农民子弟的学习要求。为使教学更好的适合群众要求，先召开了个四十七个市民的调查讨论会，大家都主张筹备就绪后，就立即开学。关于学习时间，半数赞成隔日学，半数赞成每日学。学习内容是商业簿记、数学、（代数，算术）、政治常识、国文，另有若干人提议学英文。至于书籍、讲义费提出自备，没人表示困难，这是与农村不同的一点。
    接着就招考，运用了报纸、黑板报、大字广告和广播四种方式，进行宣传，三天内报名一百二十三名。
    应该指出：这时学生的报名，大部分是经过动员的，有些街、闾还发生了拉派的现象。所以学生有的是报名不考，或者考上不来。一般的说，这时市民对学习问题，并没有十分注意。
    开学后学生陆续增至三百零九人，据一百五十一名统计，男的一百三十二人，女的十九人，年龄以十五岁至廿岁的为多，占百分之五十五，文化程度比农民高的多，计初小的占百分之六，高小占百分之六十三·五，初中百分之二十七，初中以上的百分之三·五，职业以商界占多数，其中包括学徒、店员、练习生，司帐、掌柜、小商人，共占百分之五十一，工人占百分之十五，干部百分之五，农民百分之十，学生百分之四，其他百分之五。正因为商人成份多，加上干部中有些总务、会计人员，所以大家都愿学簿记。还有为找职业为提高文化而学习的。
    开学后因为敌机的大轰炸和领导上没有注意到教员讲授，物质设备和建立制度加强正规化等问题，一时造成散漫现象，失掉了领导；再加上一部人的变天思想，学生一天天的来得少了，最少的时候不足百人，业余补校在当时好象是要走上垮台的样子，这给予群众不好的影响。
    这种情况的造成，在学校领导方面，表现了“例行公事官僚主义”的态度。每次上课时，虽然有学校的负责人在场，但他们不知道学生人数，工作很不深入，所以也鼓不起学生的劲来。另一方面，一味的只是迁就学生意见，忽略了自己的主动性，结果作了学生的尾巴。在教员方面，最糟糕的是时常缺课的现象；学生老远的走来（有的学生住在郊外十几廿里地的乡村），先生不在，又没人代替讲；空跑一趟，于是就泄气了。其次是教学方法和教学内容的问题，学生们的要求：对簿记，希望讲得清楚明白些，政治，希望讲的跟他们有关系，反对乱抓一把，欢迎有系统的讲授。但是并不能满足学生的要求。关于学生本身，也有些专门“打游击”的分子，有一种，认为这个学校，并没有社会地位，证书不证书，没有什么关系。同时认为学校不能真正地解决职业问题，因此不来了。另一种是：反正临完你得发给我证书，所以吊儿浪当，将学习不当做一回事，不经常到校。另外极少数人是离开了本市。
    经过领导同志认真地了解情况以后，决定重新整顿管理和教学的办法，并向学生说明整顿的必要，征求他们的意见。经过四、五天的酝酿，由学校出了一个正式的通告，限学生们在四天之内，一律登记。学校再加以审查。并且宣布了如下的规约：（一）如果无故旷课，点名三次（簿记班）或五次（政治班）不到者，当即通知其家长（店员通知其经理，干部通知其机关）在毕业时，不发给证书。（二）有事请假，如果缺课超过全部学习时间三分之一时，亦不发给证书。（三）实行严格点名。结果，簿记班有五十一人登记，政治班有廿六人登记。这一来，同学们的学习情绪，开始转向稳固了。除偶尔有个别的人因事或因病请假外，无故旷课的人，根本没有。同时，簿记班要求给他们增加两次（四个钟头）算术。簿记和算术练习本子都交得很快，确是表现了一种生气。后来虽经傅匪扰乱，有些学生离开城市有所影响外，一般说是较过去大有发展。
    现在，业余补校有五个文化班，学生共有二百七十八人。学员成份也有所变化，据文化班第一、第二班的统计，七十人中，工人十四名，占百分之二十，农民十五人，占百分之二十一，（以上两者由百分之二十五，增至百分之四十一。）干部八人，占百分之十一，学生五人，占百分之七，无业六人，占百分之九，商界十七人，占百分之二十四，其他五人，占百分之七。又据第三、四两个班的统计，工农占百分之四十一，而商人更减至百分之十四，另外女生也由百分之十一增至百分之二十四。这个成份的变化，正说明学校是更接近市民中的基层群众了。又根据年龄的比较，我们发现第三次的新生中，青年占的成份也大了（由百分之八十六增至百分之九十三），这给了我们开展青年工作的好机会！
    补习学校的学生，其流动性要比正规学校大得多。但我们为什么又把它逐渐稳固起来了呢？这有几个原因：（一）教员工作有了改进，文化班的教员，几乎连一次课也没有误过，而且讲得比较清楚，学生们能够“得到东西”，“来了能够粘住”。（二）与群众开始有了联系，有的机关和街区政府，写信往本校介绍学生。（三）建立了正规制度。这是全校同学，绝大多数人喜欢的。根据他们的要求，我们尽可能地建立了点名、请假和奖惩的制度。并即时地当众表扬了学习积极、不请假、或少请假的模范同学，还组织了各班的学生会，按地区分编小组，传达与执行全班的任务，加强了连系。（四）是新翻身农民子弟的要求文化。
    现在学生的学习兴趣颇高，文化班的课程，普遍是规定从星期一到星期六每晚两小时，但学生们还不满足，有的提议，每晚学习三个钟点，有的并主张白天上课。我们为了照顾程度高的同学，最近又成立了代数班；为关心程度低的赶不上，又成立了补讲班（都在正式功课外另加），满足了一部分学员的要求。一个簿记班毕业的同学这样写着：学校“对我们希望更高，他克服了一切困难，不怕辛苦，而为同学们来着想”。
    目前，我们可以这样说：业余补校的基础是打下了。但应该考虑的是应如何继续向前进一步的深入工作。
    在这四个月的工作中已取得不少的经验。
    第一、城市市民的学习要求和近郊农民的学习要求，在某种程度上是有所分别的。显著的特点是：一、近郊农民要求学习是为的准备将来到城市里来用，如经商、找事或升学等，是近于理想的，所以在即知即用的要求上，比较来的不迫切，教员讲得稍差些，也容易谅解。都市市民学习的观点却相反，它是现实的，马上学了，马上就要用，而且要实用，所以对教员的要求，也就比较高。教员教不好是不行的！（三）农民表现了散漫的习气，正规不正规，没有什么关系。市民则不行，一定要建立制度，改善物质设备，反对散漫习气，喜欢正规化。（四）因为农村里宗法的连系多，农民们的生活，比较是接近的，因此，在这中间寻找积极分子，发生带头作用，是完全适用，而且必要的。都市则不然，他们是由异乡异地，不同阶层、不同职业聚集起来的一群，因通过市场（商品交换）的关系，而连系起来的。一般的是谁也不管谁，宗法的连系极少。因此，找出积极分子来，一时起不了带头作用。当然，这并不是完全抹煞了积极分子的作用。这必须适宜地建立学生组织，举行联欢，加强连系，才会有效的。
    第二、补习学校和正规学校，还有它的相异点。补习学校要比正规学校的社会性更大些，因为它直接包括了在业的青年和成年，所以流动性也大些。又因为他们的文化水平低，政治觉悟不高，所以建立感情，交朋友是联系他们最好方式。必须举行联欢和家庭访问。因此补校一方面要尽可能地正规化，另一方面，还要适当地社会化。两种性质要适当地运用，才能推进社会教育工作。
    第三、城市业余补习学校也是联系群众发动群众最好的办法，通过它可以宣传党的政策，提高群众觉悟。
    第四、民众补习教育是民众准备就业、升学或提高其业务技能的过渡教育。因此，它应该是多样的、广大的和及时的一种教育。具体一点说，民众补习教育，应该是设立各种各样的关于提高业务技术的训练班和文化班，必须与他们当前的要求相联系，才能求得发展。
