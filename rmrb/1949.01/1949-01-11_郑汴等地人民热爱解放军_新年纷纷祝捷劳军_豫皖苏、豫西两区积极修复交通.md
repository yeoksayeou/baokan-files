Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 8th: The three major cities on the Longhai Railway, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Luoyang, are enthusiastically launching New Year celebrations of victory and troop comforting campaigns.

After the Zhengzhou City Workers' Preparatory Committee initiated a proposal to celebrate victory and comfort the troops, all sectors of the city held meetings to celebrate victory. Trains heading in all directions, east, west, north, and south, were plastered with red paper slogans celebrating victory. More than one hundred workers from the Zhengzhou Railway Factory donated over 21,000 Central Plains currency to comfort the troops and pledged to support the front lines by stepping up production and improving work efficiency. Stevedores on the Pinghan Railway proposed reducing their food intake for one day to show their appreciation to the troops on the front lines. Forty-eight industries throughout the city voluntarily donated over 376,000 yuan and a large number of soap, towels, and other comforting items. More than a thousand women making shoes, who have organized themselves in the city, jointly wrote letters to express their appreciation to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the front lines. Around the New Year, colorful flags fluttered in the prosperous streets, and walls were covered with wall newspapers and pictorials from various organizations. Various schools and organizations formed Yangko teams and stilt walkers, performing in the streets with great excitement.

All sectors of Kaifeng have universally established troop comforting committees, donating various comfort items, rushing to make comfort bags, and writing letters of appreciation. The Kaifeng Daily received hundreds of comfort packages entrusted to be forwarded to the front from all sectors in a single day, the 26th of the year. A significant characteristic of this wave of troop comforting is the particular enthusiasm of women making military shoes, production teams, and urban poor. For example, eight households in the Jiangshui Guild Hall in Fang Hutong were originally very poor, but because they made shoes, they were able to solve their livelihood problems. This time, five households personally delivered comfort items to the street government. In another street, one hundred and twenty poor people donated one hundred and sixty-four items. The Kaifeng Student Union launched a widespread publicity campaign in various schools on New Year's Day. All teachers and students from five schools, including Kaifeng High School, wrote fifteen thousand letters of appreciation. More than two thousand students from Zhongyuan University decided to save one jin of grain each and donate it to the front lines. The Dacheng and Tianchan theaters decided to hold two days of charity performances after New Year's Day to comfort the front lines.

In Luoyang, the Commercial Federation received more than 200,000 yuan in local currency and one thousand pairs of shoes to be forwarded to the front within a week. Elementary and secondary school students donated money and wrote letters of appreciation. Students from the Municipal No. 2 Elementary School wrote more than two hundred letters of appreciation, thanking the People's Liberation Army for bringing freedom and happiness to everyone.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 8th: Significant progress was made in the construction of transportation in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu and Western Henan regions in December of last year. More than a thousand miles of highways in Shangqiu, Kaifeng, Yongcheng, Bo County, and other places in Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu were repaired using existing roadbeds. Construction began in mid-December and was completed in five days. In addition to having bus stations in Xuchang, Shangqiu, and Bo County, the Highway Bureau of the region added the Zhouri Bus Station on December 13, making it possible for buses to travel to Taikang, Huaiyang, Luohe, Jieshou, and other places. Telephones between the Huaihai battlefield and the cities of Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Bo County, and Huaiyang are also unblocked. In addition to the approximately 1,200 li of postal routes that have already been opened along the Longhai Railway and in various counties in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu region, the Shangqiu and Lanfeng post offices recently sent people to the North China, East China, and Northeast liberated areas to negotiate postal service matters. Highways in Yuxian, Lushan, Linru, Dengfeng, Xiangcheng, and other places in the Western Henan region were completed in mid-December. One of the major reasons for the rapid progress in transportation construction is the active participation of the vast number of people. In Yuxian alone, 50,000 migrant workers participated in road construction. The largest project on the highway between Luoyang and Yexian is the Luohe Bridge south of Shenyang. The bridge is 43 zhang long and 1.6 zhang wide. It only took 21 days and more than 800 workers to complete this repair.

Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 2nd: The Preparatory Committee of the Luoyang City Federation of Trade Unions was established on December 17 of last year. Huang Liang, Gao Chaifu, and twenty-one other people were elected as preparatory committee members. The association is composed of more than twenty trade union organizations in the city. There are now more than 5,000 members in the enterprise trade unions in Luoyang.

　　郑汴等地人民热爱解放军
  　新年纷纷祝捷劳军
  　豫皖苏、豫西两区积极修复交通
    【新华社中原八日电】陇海路上郑州、开封、洛阳三大城市，热烈展开新年祝捷劳军运动。
    郑州市职工筹委会发起祝捷劳军建议后，全市各界即纷纷开会祝捷。开往东西南北各路的火车上，满贴了红纸标语，庆祝胜利。郑州铁工厂百余职工，献出中州币二万一千余元劳军，并以加紧生产，提高工作效率来支援前线。平汉铁路装卸工人提出缩食一天，慰问前方。全市四十八行业，自动捐款三十七万六千余元及大批肥皂、手巾等慰劳品。该市已组织起来的一千多做鞋妇女联名写信慰问前线解放军将士。新年前后，各繁盛街路彩旗飘扬，墙上贴满各机关的墙报与画报。各学校机关组成秧歌队，高跷队，穿插各街表演，热闹异常。
    开封各界普遍成立了劳军筹委会，纷纷捐献各种慰劳品，赶制慰问袋和写慰问信。开封日报在年前的二十六日一天中就收到各界托转前方的慰劳包数百件。这次劳军热潮的显著特点是做军鞋的妇女、生产小组和城市贫民特别积极。如芳胡同江水会馆八户居民原来都很贫苦，因为做鞋解决了生活困难，这次就有五户亲自送慰劳品到街政府。另外一条街一百二十户贫民就献出了一百六十四件东西。开封学生联合会发动各校在元旦进行广泛宣传运动。开封中学等五校全体师生写了一万五千封慰问信。中原大学两千余同学，决定每人节约粮食一斤，捐送前方。大成、天蟾两剧院决定于元旦后义演两天，慰劳前线。
    在洛阳，商联会一星期内收到转寄前线的本币廿余万元，鞋子一千双。各中小学生纷纷献金和写慰问信。市立二小学学生写了二百多封慰劳信，感谢解放军带给大家的自由幸福。
    【新华社中原八日电】豫皖苏及豫西两区的交通建设，在去年十二月中有显著进展。豫皖苏商邱、开封、永城、亳县等地长达千余里的公路，利用原有路基铺修，自十二月中旬动工，五天即告完成。该区公路局除在许昌、商邱、亳县设有汽车站通行班车外，又于十二月十三日加设周日汽车站、使太康、淮阳、漯河、界首等地均可通行班车。淮海战地与开封、商邱、亳县、淮阳各城市的电话也都畅通。邮路除已开辟之陇海路沿线及豫皖苏区各县共约一千二百里之外，最近已由商邱、兰封两邮局派人前往华北、华东、东北各解放区，洽商通邮事宜。豫西区之禹县、鲁山、临汝、登封、襄城等地公路，已在十二月中旬修竣。交通建设进展较快的重大原因之一是广大人民的积极参加。禹县一地参加修路的民工即有五万人。洛阳至叶县间公路上的最大工程是沈阳南之洛河大桥，该桥长四十三丈，宽一丈六，此次修建时仅历时二十一日，费工八百余个，即告竣工。
    【新华社洛阳二日电】洛阳市职工总会筹备委员会已于去年十二月十七日成立。并选出黄亮、高柴甫等二十三人为筹备委员。该会由全市二十余职工团体组成，洛阳全市各企业职工会现共有会员五千余人。
