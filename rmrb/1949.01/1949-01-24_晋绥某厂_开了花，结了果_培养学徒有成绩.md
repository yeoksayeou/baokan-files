　　"Blooming and Bearing Fruit" - Achievements in Training Apprentices
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 12th] A certain factory in Jin Sui has achieved remarkable results in training apprentices in recent years due to the correct relationship between masters and apprentices. Apprentices account for 69% of the factory's production workforce. Currently, each apprentice has mastered at least one specialized skill. Liu Shengbao, an apprentice in the fitter group, only spent a year learning a specific skill, and his daily output reached 700 pieces, exceeding that of experienced workers by 200 pieces. Recently, due to a shortage of rivet materials, the factory administration decided to switch to spot welding. However, due to insufficient current heat, the technicians unanimously agreed that the product's design needed to be changed, and a batch of production tools suitable for the revised design had to be made. However, after repeated and patient experimentation, he was able to spot weld without changing the design. Zhang Jun, a member of the New Democratic Youth League and an apprentice in the machinist group, officially started learning a specific skill last October. Initially, he could only produce 70-80 pieces per day, but after three weeks, his daily output reached over 200 pieces. Recently, his daily output has exceeded 300 pieces. In the past year, he has learned addition, subtraction, decimals, and simple fractions in his spare time and can also read machine part drawings. Apprentice Gao Mingliang broke the previous record of 80 pieces of various products per lathe per day at the beginning of last year's competition and has now increased it to more than 170 pieces. The quality has reached an unprecedented level, with only one rejected item in three months. Inspired by him, the production volume of all new and old apprentices performing similar work has doubled. The rapid progress of the factory's apprentices' skills is inseparable from the factory's correct master-apprentice relationship. To train apprentices into technicians as quickly as possible, the master craftsmen, like kind nannies, patiently taught them technical skills, supervised and guided their cultural studies, and encouraged apprentices to teach apprentices, with those with higher skills teaching those with lower skills, and those who progressed faster teaching those who progressed slower. The apprentices also worked hard to learn, asking questions when they didn't understand. Some didn't take afternoon naps and went to the workshop to study on-site. The masters were thrilled to see the seedlings they had nurtured blooming and bearing fruit.

  　“开了花，结了果”培养学徒有成绩
    【新华社晋绥十二日电】晋绥某厂培养学徒，由于师徒关系正确，近年来有极显著的成绩。该厂学徒占参加生产人数的百分之六十九，现在每个学徒最低限度都能掌握一种专门技术。该厂钳工股学徒刘升保，学习某种专门技术仅一年工夫，所出产品每天即达七百件，较过去的熟练工人，尚超出二百件。最近因为铆钉原料困难，该厂行政决定改为点焊，但因电流热力不足，试验结果，技工们一致认为必须改变产品样子，并须添制一批适应改过样子以后的生产工具，可是经他反复耐心试验，不要改样子，就能点焊了。机工股学徒新民主主义青年团员张钧，去年十月正式学习某种专门技术，开始每日只能出货七、八十件，三周后，每日出货即达二百余件，最近日产量已逾三百件。最近一年来他在工作余暇学会了四则、小数和简单的分数，还可以看机件草图。学徒高明亮，去年在竞赛运动的初期，即突破每部车床每日出各种产品八十余件的最高纪录，现在已增至一百七十余件，质量达到空前纪录，三个月只有一个废活。在他的影响激励下，所有相同性质工作的新旧学徒，生产量均较原来提高两倍。该厂学徒技术的迅速进步，是与该厂正确的师徒关系不可分的。为了把学徒们以最快的速度培养成技工，老师傅们就象慈祥保姆一样，每日耐心的教他们学技术，督促与指导他们学文化，并发动学徒带学徒，技术高的带技术低的，进步快的带进步慢的。学徒们也努力学习，不懂的就问人，有的夏天不睡午睡，就跑到工房里实地学习。师傅们看到他们自己培育起来的幼芽，开了花，结了果，都很兴奋。
