　　Twins Should Be Treated as Two Children
Editor:
I am the Minister of the Armed Forces Department of Yi County. My wife works in the Women's Federation of the 11th District of Yi County. She gave birth to two girls on November 2nd last year. The Civil Affairs Section of Yi County says that the treatment is calculated as one person, but I don't know if this is the case. In addition, if ordinary people have twins, should one or two tax exemption points be deducted when calculating the burden of agricultural tax? I would appreciate a reply.

Comrade Longquan:
Your wife is a cadre of the District Women's Federation. She had twins, and their treatment should be supplied according to two children; however, the mother of the children can only enjoy one childbirth allowance. If ordinary people have several children in one birth, they will be calculated with the tax exemption points of several people.

专栏：询问与答复

　　一胎双孩应按双孩待遇编辑同志：
    我是易县武装部部长，我的爱人在易县十一区妇联会工作，去年十一月二日生了两个女孩子，其待遇据易县民政科说是按一人计算，但不知是否这样？此外，如老百姓一胎双孩者，在计算农业税的负担时应扣一人或两人的免税点呢？请答复为盼。
    　　　　　　　龙泉龙泉同志：
    你爱人是区妇联干部，她一胎双孩，其待遇应按两个小孩供给；但小孩的母亲只能享受一胎的分娩费。老百姓一胎生几个孩子，即以几个人的免税点计算。
