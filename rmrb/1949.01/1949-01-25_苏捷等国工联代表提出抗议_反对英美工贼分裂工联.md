　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. TASS reports: Leaders of the working class in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, South America, Australia, and other countries have strongly protested against the conspiracy of British and American trade unionists to split the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and undermine the international solidarity of working people. Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions, pointed out in Paris on the 16th, in response to a question from an Agence France-Presse reporter: The proposal made by the Standing Committee of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) to suspend the activities of the WFTU for one year is very wrong and harmful, and will seriously undermine the international trade union movement and the vital interests of working people. On the contrary, it is now necessary to further strengthen the international trade union movement more than ever before, and to develop the activities of the WFTU. The Soviet Trade Unions are prepared to discuss the future activities of the WFTU and are willing to cooperate with the central bodies of trade unions in all countries, including the British TUC and the American CIO. In reply to a question from the reporter as to whether the WFTU will continue its activities if the central bodies of trade unions in some countries still withdraw from the WFTU, Kuznetsov replied: "The Soviet Trade Unions believe that the WFTU will continue its activities in accordance with the principles of its charter, because the workers need the WFTU. The WFTU is the most important organization of the working class in the struggle to improve the living conditions of workers and all working people, to fight for their economic and social rights and freedoms, and is the most important organization of the working class in the struggle against reactionaries, against the propaganda and preparation for a new war, and for the consolidation and lasting peace of all nations." In conclusion, Kuznetsov emphasized his deep confidence in the vitality of the WFTU and its need to exist and be further strengthened.
　　The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions, on behalf of three million members, sent a telegram to WFTU General Secretary Saillant on the 16th, protesting against the divisive policies of the leadership of the British TUC, and demanding that the WFTU fight more vigorously to strengthen the front of peace and progress. The telegram pointed out that the working people of Czechoslovakia pledge their full support to the efforts of the WFTU.
　　Ocampo, Secretary of the Latin American Labor Confederation, representing 6.7 million trade union members in Latin America, went to Paris to attend the WFTU Executive Bureau meeting. When he met with a reporter from the London Workers' Daily on the 10th, he strongly protested against the attempt to split the WFTU and fiercely opposed the British proposal to suspend the activities of the WFTU for one year.
　　Durlingden, General Secretary of the Australian National Metal Workers' Union and Australian representative to the WFTU, said in Sydney on the 17th that the right-wing representatives of the British and American trade unions, Deakin and Carey, attempted to undermine the organization because they had failed to force the WFTU to adopt the policies of British and American imperialism. Monk, Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, also recently stated in Sydney that Australian trade unions do not agree with the British TUC's proposal to suspend the activities of the WFTU for one year.

　　苏捷等国工联代表提出抗议
  　反对英美工贼分裂工联
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】综合塔斯社报导：苏、捷、南美、澳洲等国工人阶级的领袖，强烈抗议英美工贼企图分裂世界工联、破坏劳动人民国际团结的阴谋。苏联职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫，十六日在巴黎答复法新社记者询问时指出：英国职工大会常委会所提要求世界工联停止活动一年的建议，是非常错误和有害的，这会严重地破坏国际职工运动和劳动人民的切身利益。相反，现在必须要比以往任何时候进一步加强国际职工运动，并发展世界工联的活动。苏联职工会准备讨论世界工联将来活动的问题，并愿与一切国家职工会中央机构合作，包括英国职工大会及美国产联在内。在答复记者所询如果某些国家职工会中央机构仍然退出世界工联的话，世界工联是否将继续其活动的问题时，库兹涅佐夫答称：“苏联职工会相信：世界工联将根据其章程中的各项原则继续活动，因为工人们需要世界工联。世界工联是工人阶级在为改善工人及一切劳动者生活条件、争取他们经济及社会权利与自由的斗争中的最重要的组织，是工人阶级在为反对反动派、反对新战争的宣传及准备、争取各民族巩固与持久和平的斗争中的最重要的组织。”库兹涅佐夫在结语中强调他对世界工联的活力及其必须存在与进一步的巩固深具信心。
    捷克斯洛伐克职工会中央委员会，于十六日代表三百万会员致电世界工联总书记赛扬，抗议英国职工大会领导机构的分裂政策，并要求世界工联更加奋力地为加强和平与进步阵线而斗争。电文指出：捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民誓将完全支持世界工联的努力。
    拉丁美洲劳工联盟书记奥康波，代表拉丁美洲六百七十万职工会员赴巴黎出席世界工联执行局会议，他在十日接见英国伦敦工人日报记者时，对分裂世界工联的企图表示强烈抗议。并激烈反对英国所提停止世界工联活动一年的建议。
    澳大利亚全国金属工人联合会总书记、澳大利亚出席世界工联代表笃林登，十七日在悉尼发表谈话称：英美工会的右翼代表狄金与加莱，因为没有能够强迫世界工联通过英美帝国主义的政策，他们便企图破坏这一组织。澳大利亚工会理事会书记孟克，最近亦在悉尼声称：澳大利亚各工会不同意英国职工大会所提的停止世界工联活动一年的建议。
