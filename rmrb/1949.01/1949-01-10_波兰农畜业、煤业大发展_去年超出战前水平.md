　　波兰农畜业、煤业大发展
  　去年超出战前水平
    【新华社陕北八日电】波兰一九四八年在农业、牧畜业、煤业方面均有巨大成就。据塔斯社华沙讯：波农业部长杜姆伯·科提尔在报纸上公布波兰农业在一九四八年的成绩和一九四九年的任务称：一九四八年，耕种面积一千四百二十六万四千公顷，而计划只规定一千三百九十万公顷。农业机械化使耕种面积的扩大大为有利。一九四八年的小麦收获量已达战前水平，而裸麦则超过战前水平。他又指出当前波兰农业的较重大的任务是发展牧畜业。一九四八年牛羊头数较一九四七年增加百分之二十二，猪的头数较一九四七年增加百分之十一。一九四九年将要分别增加百分之三十八和百分之四十一。为了在一九四九年发展牧畜业，已拨款五十二亿波币。
    另讯：一九四八年波兰采煤工业产煤七千零二十五万九千七百吨，即超过计划百分之四点一。与战前一九三八年的三千八百一十万吨相较，几乎增加一倍。波兰采煤工业的一切煤矿，都已超出了战前水平。褐煤的产量为五百零一万七千九百吨，超过全年计划百分之十九点五。一九四八年，焦煤也超过生产计划。
