　　Village Cadres in Jitai Village Conduct Mutual Criticism
  　Unfair Shoe Distribution Immediately Corrected
    [North Yue Electric Dispatch] When Jitai Village in the Fifth District of Fuping County distributed military shoe quotas at the beginning of last month, unfair phenomena occurred. Out of the village's 61 households, 59 were women with full labor capacity. The district allocated 80 pairs of military shoes, giving each woman one and a half pairs. However, the branch secretary, the organization committee member, and villagers who were on good terms with village cadres were only allocated one pair each. The majority of the villagers were dissatisfied.
    When district cadres arrived in the village and discovered this problem, they immediately convened a review meeting for all 14 main cadres. Initially, the branch and group were somewhat unconvinced by the inspection. He said, "I made fewer military shoes for a reason! My wife just gave birth, and even livestock are exempt from duty for four months before and after giving birth!" Another comrade said, "Your wife gave birth and should be taken care of, but there are several other women in our village who gave birth, why didn't you take care of them?" The cadres debated heatedly, and finally the former's opinion was refuted. The district cadre said, "Admitting mistakes and correcting them doesn't count as a mistake. We should not only criticize the cadres who distributed the military shoes unfairly, but why didn't everyone come when the village chief asked everyone to discuss the distribution!" The branch secretary said, "I accept the opinions of the masses, and I agree with Comrade Yang's (district cadre) criticism. In the future, if we hold more meetings for review, our work will improve!" Other comrades also expressed their attitudes, agreeing with the branch secretary's views. The village chief said, "Our village distributed 80 pairs of public shoes, with each laborer bearing one and a half pairs, leaving a surplus of eight and a half pairs. Let's discuss what to do!" Finally, the result of everyone's discussion was: the seven households with no labor force would make a few fewer pairs of military work, and three women with chronic illnesses would have three pairs deducted. The next day, this distribution method was announced, and the masses were very satisfied. (Yang Huaitian, Geng Qian, Meng Guangcheng)

　　祭台村干部开展互相批评
  　派鞋不公马上纠正
    【北岳电】阜平五区祭台村上月初分配军鞋任务时，曾发生不公平现象。全村六十一户，五十九个妇女整劳力，区上分配来八十双军鞋，每个妇女分了一双半；而支部书记和组织委员和村干部有情面的群众都只分配了一双。大部群众不满。
    区干部到村发现这个问题，马上召集所有十四个主要干部开检讨会。起初支组对检查有点不服气，他说：“我少作军鞋是有道理的！我女人生了小孩，就是个牲口产期前后还要免四个月的勤务呀！”另一同志说：“你女人生了小孩，应当照顾，可是咱村里还有几个妇女，生了小孩你怎么没有照顾呀？”干部议论纷纷，终于前者的意见被驳倒了。区干部说：“知错改错不算错。我们不只要单纯批评分配军鞋的干部，为什么村长叫大家都来讨论分配，大家又不来呢！”支部书记说：“我接受群众的意见，赞同杨同志（区干部）的批评，今后大家多开会检查，工作就会搞好！”其他同志也跟着表示态度，赞同支书的见解。村长说：“咱村分配了八十双公鞋，每个劳力负担一双半，尚超余八双半，大家讨论怎办吧！”最后大家讨论的结果是：无劳力的七户军工属少做几双，三个常年有病的妇女减去三双。第二天这个分配办法公布，群众很满意。（杨怀田、耿倩、孟广城）
