Annihilating 600,000 Enemies in the Huaihai Campaign: Only Two Months and Five Days
    The encirclement and annihilation of Du Yuming's bandit troops was the final and most victorious stage of the Huaihai Campaign. According to preliminary calculations, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) annihilated a "Suppression General Headquarters" deputy commander's command, three army corps headquarters, ten army headquarters, and twenty-five complete divisions, along with special forces, irregular troops, and rear echelon units, totaling 300,000 men. The first stage of the Huaihai Campaign was the encirclement and annihilation of Huang Baitao's army corps in Nianzhuang, east of Xuzhou, on November 7th. In this stage, the PLA annihilated a Pacification Office command, one army corps headquarters, eight army headquarters, and eighteen complete divisions, along with other irregular troops, totaling 178,000 men. From November 24th to December 15th, the PLA annihilated Huang Wei's army corps in the Shuangduiji area, southwest of Suxian County, which was the second stage of the Huaihai Campaign. The PLA annihilated one army corps headquarters, four army headquarters, and twelve complete divisions of enemy regular troops, totaling approximately 110,000 men, in the Shuangduiji area.

    The entire Huaihai Campaign, from November 6th of last year to the 10th of this month, lasted a total of two months and five days. The PLA annihilated one "Suppression General Headquarters" deputy commander's command, one Pacification Office command, five army corps headquarters, twenty-two army headquarters, and fifty-five complete divisions (including four and a half divisions that revolted), totaling approximately 600,000 men. At the start of the Huaihai Campaign, all the Kuomintang bandit troops concentrated on the Huaihai battlefield, namely Du Yuming's command and Li Mi's army corps in Xuzhou, Huang Baitao's army corps east of Xuzhou, Qiu Qingquan's and Liu Ruming's army corps west of Xuzhou, Feng Zhi'an's two armies north of Xuzhou, and one army and two divisions south of Xuzhou in Suining, Suxian, and Lingbi, totaling forty-nine divisions. Except for Feng Zhi'an's three and a half divisions which revolted, and Liu Ruming's army corps whose remaining five divisions narrowly escaped after one division was annihilated, the rest were completely wiped out. In addition, the PLA annihilated Huang Wei's army corps of eleven divisions, which was transferred from southern Henan to reinforce after the Huaihai Campaign began. As a result of the PLA liberating the entire area north of the Huai River and the vast area south of the Huai River, the entire southern front of the Kuomintang bandit army has suffered an irreparable and fatal blow after the Huaihai Campaign. The Kuomintang's main forces have now been almost completely lost, and the remaining forces on the entire southern front are also very few. According to statistics, the Kuomintang government now has only eleven armies and twenty-five divisions in the area west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway north of the Yangtze River. Including the Kuomintang army in the Hankou-Xinyang area and western Hubei, there are no more than nineteen armies and thirty-five divisions, which is twenty divisions fewer than the forces annihilated in the Huaihai Campaign.

　　淮海歼敌六十万　仅历两月零五天
    围歼杜聿明匪部是淮海战役中最后的也是胜利最大的一个阶段。据初步计算，解放军共歼灭敌人一个“剿总”副总司令指挥部、三个兵团司令部、十个军部，二十五个整师，连同特种部队，非正规军及后方机关等共三十万人。淮海战役的第一阶段是十一月七日在徐州以东碾庄围歼黄百韬兵团。在这一阶段中共歼敌一个绥署指挥部、一个兵团部、八个军部、十八个整师，连同其他非正规军等共十七万八千人。自十一月二十四日至十二月十五日解放军在宿县西南地区双堆集地区歼灭黄维兵团是淮海战役的第二阶段。解放军在双堆集地区共歼灭敌正规军一个兵团部、四个军部、十二个整师共约十一万人。
    整个淮海战役自去年十一月六日至本月十日止，前后共历时两个月零五天，解放军一气歼灭了一个“剿总”副总司令指挥部、一个绥署指挥部、五个兵团司令部，廿二个军部，五十五个整师（内四个半师起义）等共约六十万人。在淮海战役发动时，集中在淮海战场上的所有国民党匪军，即徐州的杜聿明指挥部及李弥兵团，徐州以东的黄百韬兵团，徐州以西的邱清泉及刘汝明兵团，徐州以北的冯治安部两个军，徐州以南睢宁、宿县、灵璧的一个军另二个师，以上共四十九个师，除冯治安部三个半师起义、刘汝明兵团在被歼一个师后其余五个师负创侥幸脱逃外，其余全部被歼，另外还多歼灭了一个在淮海战役开始后由豫南调来增援的黄维兵团十一个师。由于解放军解放了淮河以北的全部地区和淮河以南的广大地区。经过淮海战役，整个南线的国民党匪军已遭受了无法挽救的致命打击。国民党的主力部队现在已丧失殆尽了，而整个南线的兵力也所余无几了。据统计：现在国民党政府在长江以北津浦路西侧地区只有十一个军二十五个师，加上汉口信阳地区和鄂西地区的国民党军，也不过十九个军三十五个师，比淮海战役被歼灭部队还少二十个师。
