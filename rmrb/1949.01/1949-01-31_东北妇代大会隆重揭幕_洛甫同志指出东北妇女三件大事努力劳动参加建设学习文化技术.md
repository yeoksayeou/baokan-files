Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th. The first unprecedentedly grand women's representative congress in Northeast history grandly opened in Shenyang on the 20th of this month. Among the 283 representatives from all over Northeast China, there are female workers from factories and mines, rural women, urban intellectual women, families of the People's Liberation Army, female medical personnel, childcare workers, and female cadres in various work positions, many of whom are heroes and models on the production front. The congress began in solemn song. Subsequently, Cai Chang, Liu Yaxiong, Zeng Zhi, Luo Shuzhang, Li Fenglian, Sun Yijin, Chen Boer, and 28 others were elected to the presidium. Yang Kebing, Deputy Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC and chairman of the meeting, pointed out in his opening speech that the purpose of convening the congress was to determine the tasks of the Northeast women's movement in the future, to elect the leading body of the Northeast women's movement, and to elect representatives to attend the First National Congress of Chinese Women. Luo Fu, representative of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CPC, explained in his speech that the women of Northeast China, along with all the people of Northeast China, had undergone heroic struggles for three years and had achieved fundamental liberation. He said: In the countryside, women have received an equal share of land and housing as men in the land reform; in factories and mines, female workers receive equal pay for equal work as male workers, and enjoy democratic and equal rights. The democratic government has also promulgated laws to protect women's rights. These achievements are the result of the heroic struggle of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the people of Northeast China, and the women of Northeast China under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Regarding the future tasks of women in Northeast China, Comrade Luo Fu pointed out: First of all, we must vigorously support the National Liberation War so that the revolution can achieve complete victory throughout the country. Therefore, diligent labor, participation in various construction projects, and studying culture and technology are the three major tasks for women in Northeast China in the future. As female cadres who are advanced elements of women, they should do a better job of mobilizing and educating the masses of women. Guests attending the meeting also delivered speeches. Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, Zhou Huan, Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, Zhang Qinqiu, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and others, all praised the achievements of women in the Northeast liberated areas in various fields over the past three years, and hoped that they would further strive for the liberation of women throughout the country. Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Democratic Women's Federation, and Cao Mengjun, a member of the Preparatory Committee, both emphasized in their speeches that Chinese women can only achieve complete liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Finally, female labor hero Li Fenglian spoke, excitedly saying: "On behalf of all female workers, I assure the conference that we must work hard to produce and support the National Liberation War in the future, so that Chairman Mao's banner will be planted all over China."

　　Simultaneously with the opening of the congress, a small exhibition was also held, including products produced by women from various parts of Northeast China, photographs of Soviet women's lives, propaganda materials from democratic women from all over the world, and various exquisite gifts sent by representatives of the Second International Women's Congress to the Women's Federation in the Chinese Liberated Areas.

　　东北妇代大会隆重揭幕
    洛甫同志指出东北妇女三件大事努力劳动参加建设学习文化技术
    【新华社沈阳廿八日电】东北历史上第一次空前盛大的妇女代表大会，已于本月二十日在沈阳隆重揭幕。从东北各地赶来赴会的二百八十三名代表中，有工厂矿山的女工，有农村妇女，有城市知识妇女，有人民解放军的家属，有女医务人员、保育工作者以及各个工作岗位上的女干部，其中有不少是生产战线上的英雄和模范。大会在庄严的歌声中开始。接着通过蔡畅、刘亚雄、曾志、罗淑章、李凤莲、孙以瑾、陈波儿等三十五人为主席团。主席中共辽宁省委副书记杨克冰在致开幕词中指出：召开大会的目的是为了确定今后东北妇女运动的任务，选举东北妇女运动的领导机关，并选举出席中国妇女第一次全国代表大会的代表。中共东北中央局代表洛甫在讲话中，说明三年来东北妇女和东北全体人民一起进行了英勇的斗争已经获得了根本的解放。他说：在农村里，妇女在土地改革中分得了和男人同等的一份土地和房屋；在工厂矿山里，女工与男工同工同酬，享受着民主平等的权利。民主政府并已颁布法律，保障妇女的权利。这些成绩的获得，是由于东北解放军、东北人民、东北妇女在中国共产党中央与毛主席正确的领导下，英勇奋斗的结果。对东北妇女今后的任务，洛甫同志指出：首先必须大力支援全国解放战争，使革命在全国获得完全胜利。因此，努力劳动，参加各种建设工作，学习文化技术，就是今后东北妇女的三件大事。作为妇女先进分子的女干部，更应该做好发动教育妇女群众的工作。出席大会的来宾也纷纷致词。中华全国职工总会副主席李立三，东北行政委员会副主席高崇民，东北军区政治部主任周桓，全国民主妇女联合会筹备委员会秘书长张琴秋等，一致盛赞东北解放区妇女三年来在各方面的成就，并希望她们更进一步为争取全国妇女的解放而努力。中国民主妇女联合会筹备委员会副主席李德全和筹备委员曹孟君，在讲话中都着重指出中国妇女只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导下才能得到彻底解放。最后由女劳动英雄李凤莲讲话，她兴奋地说：“我代表全体女工向大会保证今后一定要努力生产，支援全国解放战争，让毛主席的旗帜插遍全中国。”
    与大会开幕同时，还举行了小型的展览会，展览品包括东北各地妇女的生产品，苏联妇女生活的照片，世界各国民主妇女的宣传品，及第二次国际妇女代表大会的代表送给中国解放区妇女联合会的各种精致礼物。
