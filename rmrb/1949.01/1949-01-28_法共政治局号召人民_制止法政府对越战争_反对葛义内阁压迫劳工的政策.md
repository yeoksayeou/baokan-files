　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 26th: TASS Paris, January 22nd: The Politburo of the French Communist Party recently issued a communique exposing the war policy pursued by the French government in Vietnam. The communique stated: As a result of continuing this bloody colonial war, French taxpayers are forced to bear a huge cost of about 100 billion francs each year. The communique pointed out that the attempt to reinstate former Vietnamese King Bảo Đại to power in Vietnam proves that French colonial imperialism hopes to reimplement a policy of exploitation and oppression in Vietnam that the Vietnamese people can no longer tolerate. The communique called on the French people to demand an end to the war in Vietnam and to begin negotiations with President Ho Chi Minh. The Politburo heard reports on many workers petitioning for no increase in rent before wages and subsidies are increased. The Politburo has commissioned Communist Party parliamentarians to make every effort to have its proposed bill on rent discussed in the National Assembly as soon as possible. The Politburo declared that the Queuille Cabinet is pursuing a policy that promotes soaring prices, while resolutely refusing to increase wages and subsidies (Note: The demand of the three major French trade unions to adjust wages in line with living standards was rejected by the Queuille government on January 14). This situation has aroused reasonable protest from workers and state organ employees. The Politburo welcomes all expressions of unity among the working people in striving to meet their needs and in the unity of the workers' movement. Because strengthening this unity can prevent the government from imposing even greater burdens on the working people while capitalists obtain more and more profits.

　　法共政治局号召人民
  　制止法政府对越战争
    反对葛义内阁压迫劳工的政策
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：法共政治局顷发表公报，向人民揭露法政府在越南奉行的战争政策。公报略称：由于继续这一血腥的殖民战争的结果，法国纳税人每年被迫负担约一千亿法郎的巨大费用。公报指出：准备在越南使前越王保大重握政权的企图，证明法国殖民帝国主义希望在越南重新实施为越南人民再也不能容忍的剥削与压迫的政策。公报号召法国人民要求终止在越南的战争，并与胡志明总统开始谈判。政治局听取了关于很多工人请愿要求在工资与补助金增加以前不增加房租的报告。政治局已委共产党议会党员尽一切努力使它所提关于房租的议案尽早在国民议会中讨论。政治局宣称：葛义内阁奉行着促进物价飞涨的政策，同时却断然拒绝了增加工资与补助金（按：法国三大工会关于适应生活水平调整工资的要求，已于一月十四日遭葛义政府拒绝）。这种形势引起了工人和国家机关雇员的合理抗义。政治局欢迎劳动人民在争取满足其需要与工人运动统一中的一切团结的表现。因为加强这种团结，就能够阻止政府在资本家取得愈来愈多的利润时所加给劳动人民的更大负担。
