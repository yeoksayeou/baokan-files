Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Reliable sources report that the terrorist conspiracies of the Kuomintang secret service have not weakened as the Kuomintang reactionary government has announced, but are in fact intensifying. The secret service in Nanjing has formed an assassination squad of 150 people, using silenced pistols to assassinate revolutionary democrats. Furthermore, Zheng Jiemin, the head of the Kuomintang military intelligence and vice minister of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense, flew to Beiping earlier this month and instructed the "Military Intelligence" agents in Beiping to carry out various conspiracy plans, including infiltrating revolutionary ranks to continue counter-revolutionary activities and disrupting the democratic order after the liberation of Beiping. The specific steps are as follows: First, senior and important agents should fly away as much as possible, while middle and lower-level agents should try to lie dormant, use the "peace talks" to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, and carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Second, after the liberation of Beiping, carry out terrorist and sabotage activities to disrupt social order and cause public unrest. In particular, impersonate communists to assassinate foreign nationals and burn down foreign assets, in order to arouse the animosity of foreign nationals towards the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army.

　　国民党特务机关正加强恐怖阴谋
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】确息：国民党特务机关的恐怖阴谋不但没有象国民党反动政府所宣布的减弱了，而且正在加强。南京的特务机关已组成一百五十人的一个暗杀队，使用无声手枪来暗杀革命的民主分子。又，国民党军统特务头子、伪国防部次长郑介民，于本月上旬飞抵北平时，曾向北平的“军统”特务分子布置各项阴谋计划，包括打入革命队伍，继续反革命活动，和破坏北平解放后的民主秩序。其具体步骤为：第一，凡高级重要特务尽量飞走，中下级特务则尽量设法潜伏，利用“和谈”，打入革命队伍，进行反革命活动。第二，在北平解放后，进行恐怖和破坏活动，以破坏社会秩序，引起人民不安。尤其假冒共产党人名义，暗杀外国侨民，烧毁外侨资财，以便激起一般外国侨民对于中国共产党和人民解放军的恶感。
