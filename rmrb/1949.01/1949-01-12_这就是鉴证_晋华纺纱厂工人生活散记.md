　　“This is the Proof": Scattered Notes on the Life of Workers at the Jinhua Textile Mill

　　Our beancake is left over now.
    "Jinhua Street" – a large round gate with these three large red characters written on it. Walking through this gate is like entering a very long street. The workers' dormitories are in a row of small doors facing east. When I entered the dormitory, the children ran to report. A middle-aged woman was cooking, and she greeted me with a smile as soon as she saw me.
    "Comrade, come in and sit down!"
    Before we could say a few words, the room was filled with people, men, women, old, and young, making it very lively. Everyone called her Teacher "Shuai". While she was making pancakes, she talked to us about living conditions. She said, "The wages we earn are about the same as before, but now we can buy real things. There aren't many people in my family, and we can eat a meal of white flour every day and a half." Now wages are calculated based on actual goods. When the warlord Yan was in power, wages were half grain and half money, and wages were always withheld, and prices were constantly rising. An old worker said, "I used to earn six and two-fifths *sheng*, but when the grain was distributed, I got at most two and eight-tenths *sheng*, not even half. Handling fees, transportation fees, and losses all had to come out of that. The other half of the money was determined by their 'calculations.' For example, if it was two million yuan, you could only buy fifty thousand yuan worth of goods. That was considered good. Sometimes that other half of the money was simply worthless!" When the factory was first liberated, many workers had no way to survive, eating beancake and bran. Fortunately, the democratic government used the method of "work relief," such as mobilizing women to wash military uniforms, which solved the problem of livelihood. Now their lives have improved. A worker's family member said to me, "Comrade, look, my face is red now! After work, I go to the club to play basketball; I'm full of energy. I never had the leisure to do that before! Not only could we not avoid eating bran and beancake, but we might be 'summoned for instruction' at any time!" An old lady grabbed me and said, "Comrade, have you seen beancake? I'll show you the dark beancake we used to eat... Ask anyone on Jinhua Street, no matter how many people they had in their family, who hasn't eaten it! We haven't eaten it since liberation!" Another worker said with a smile, "Now our beancake is left over!"
　　The "Daily Fun" Club
    As soon as I entered the club, I asked, "Which day is designated as entertainment time?" A young worker said with a smile, "Come on, Comrade! We have fun every day here." This club was established not long ago and is divided into Peking Opera and Jin Opera groups. The walls are covered with cast lists, club rules... They are rehearsing "Fishing Family" and "Hongluan Joy," making a lot of noise. Zhao Renfu, the head of the club, said very politely to us, "Right now, everyone is very happy to work. After work, they come to relax and entertain themselves, but they don't know how to do it yet, so they are just learning..." He pointed to the opera lyrics copied on the blackboard and said, "We write the lyrics first, and when we learn the opera, we'll also recognize the characters!..." After the actors rehearsed a section of the opera, they immediately took out their small notebooks and pencils and hunched over the windowsill to copy the lines and songs. Some young female workers gathered together to practice writing their names and compared them with the cast list on the wall to see if they were written correctly. When you approached them, they hid their notebooks and ran away, giggling. Old Wang said to me, "Now they don't even know enough characters to recognize them all! Look at the small notebooks they're using to practice writing." Their learning and entertainment are closely combined, and their attitude is very serious and conscientious. When rehearsing, they do it again if they don't learn it right the first time. Old Xu, a worker nearing sixty, always smiles, claps his hands to keep time, and hums like a *huqin*: Long ge long ge... to rehearse the opera for them. If it doesn't sound right after one run-through, the actors and audience smile at each other, and then they do it again.
　　Compare and See
    We started chatting, from the past to the present...
    Luo Liangming, a fine yarn worker, said, "Don't believe it, let's compare and see. He (referring to the warlord Yan) advertised that the Eighth Route Army used twenty-four tortures and thirty-six killings, but we haven't seen any of them used since liberation?"
    "He also talked about democracy and freedom, but who dared to ask about anything in the factory in the past? Not to mention making suggestions; could you just casually say a few words to those officials?"
    "He always said that workers should unite, but he told you to monitor each other, afraid to make friends, afraid to tell the truth, no one trusted anyone!"
    Old Liu immediately continued, "This is the proof... If the People's Liberation Army's politics weren't good, why would the common people love to listen? The day of liberation, I went to the street, and there were piles and piles of people surrounding a soldier, not running away but crowding closer. The soldiers' clothes looked about the same as before, but their energy was completely different! Everyone knows that the People's Liberation Army tells the whole truth, and what they say can be done."
    "Now we don't need supervisors when we work, everyone is vying to do it. In the past, it took a week to complete one machine, now it only takes three days!"
    Old Liu happily said again, "Yes! This is the proof! Comrade, don't you think so?"
    "...This is the proof!" I replied with a smile.

　　“这就是鉴证”　晋华纺纱厂工人生活散记
     雁军
  　俺们的豆饼都剩下啦。
    “晋华街”——一个大圆门上边写着这样红色的三个大字。从这个门走进去，象是一条很长的街道，工人宿舍就在一排朝东开的小门里，当我走进宿舍的时候，小孩子们便飞跑地去报告了。一个中年妇人正在做饭，看见我马上笑着迎了出来。
    “同志，到屋坐吧！”
    我们还没说几句话，一会儿就挤满一屋子人，男的女的老的少的很热闹。人们都喊她“帅”师父家。她一边烙饼，一边和我们谈起了生活问题。她说：“工资挣的数和过去差不多，可是这会能买到实在东西。俺家人口不多，隔一天半天就能吃上顿白面。”现在工资是以实物作基础来计算的。阎匪在时，工资是半粮半钱，并且月月压工资，物价又不断的上涨。一个老工人说：“我过去挣六升二合五，发下粮食，顶多得二升八，连一半都得不上。搬运费、车费、损失都得从这里出。另外那一半钱是由人家‘盘算’着定的，比如二百万元，发下来顶多能买五十万元钱的东西。这还是好的。有时根本这一半钱就等于没有！”这个工厂在刚解放时，很多工人生活都没办法，吃豆饼吃麸子，当时幸亏民主政府以“以工代赈”的方法，如发动妇女们洗军衣等……才解决了生活困难。现在他们的生活都好起来了，一个工人家属对我说：“同志，你看这回脸都红啦！下了工跑俱乐部打篮球，挺有劲；从前哪儿还有这个闲心！麸子豆饼吃不上还不说，还说不定哪一时叫你‘传训’呢！”一个老大娘拉着我：“同志，你见过豆饼没有？我领你看看俺先前吃的郡黑豆饼去……，问问晋华街不管人多人少哪家没吃过！解放以后这才都不吃啦！”另一个工人笑着说：“这回俺们的豆饼都剩下啦！”
    “天天乐”的俱乐部
    一进俱乐部的门，我问：“你们规定哪天是娱乐时间？”一个年青的小工人笑着说：“来吧，同志！我们这是天天乐。”这个俱乐部刚建立不久，分京剧组和晋剧组。墙上贴着演员名单，俱乐部规则……他们正在排“打渔杀家”、“鸿鸾喜”，敲打得很热闹。俱乐部组长赵仁甫很客气地对我们说：“这会主要是大家工作得很高兴，下工来娱乐娱乐，都不会，刚学……”他指着黑板上抄的戏词说：“先把戏词写上，戏学会啦字也认得啦！……”演员们排完了一段戏，马上就掏出小本小铅笔，伏在窗台上抄台词抄歌子。一些年青的女工凑到一块练习写自己的名子，和墙上的演员名单对照着看写错没有。当你走近她们时，她们便把小本藏起，嬉笑着跑开了。老王对我说：“这会学的字都不够他们认的啦！你看拿的那个都是练字的小本本”。他们的学习和娱乐是紧紧地结合着的，并且态度非常严肃认真。排戏时，一遍学不象再来。年近六十的工人老徐，总是笑眯眯地，手拍手当拍子，用嘴哼当胡琴：隆格隆格……地给他们排戏。走一遍说不象，演员和观众不约而同地相对一笑，于是再来一遍。
    比比看看
    闲谈起来了，从过去到现在……
    细纱工人罗良明说：“不信咱比比看看，他（指阎匪）宣传八路军二十四刑三十六杀“可是解放这些天也没见用过一样？”
    “他也说民主自由，可是过去工厂事谁敢问问？别说是提意见；和他们那些官们看能随便说几句话不能”？
    “他也老说工人要团结，可是他叫你一个监视一个，不敢交朋友不敢说真话，谁也不信实谁！”
    老刘立刻接着说：“这就是鉴证……解放军政治不好，老百姓怎么都爱听？解放那天我上街，那一堆这一堆都是一群老百姓当中围个兵，人们不但不跑还都往近凑。光是看兵的衣裳和过去差不多，可是劲头一点也不一样！都知道解放军说的全是实话，说了就能办到。”
    “这会干活用不着监工，都争着抢着干。过去按一部车子一星期，这会三天就完！”
    老刘高兴地又说道：“是啊！这就是鉴证！同志，你说是不？”
    “……这就是鉴证！”我笑着回答他。
