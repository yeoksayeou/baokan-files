　　Experiences in the West Line Hospital
    Meiling
    West Line Mobile Second, Fifth, Sixth Hospitals, Rear Fifth Hospital, Station Hospital. During the Taiyuan Campaign, under the slogan of "Everything for the Comfort and Satisfaction of the Wounded and Sick," all staff members, with boundless love for the wounded and sick, overcame difficulties and successfully completed their tasks, creating many valuable experiences. Here are some excerpts:
    (1) Wounded Enter the Ward in One and a Half Minutes
    In the past, hospital reception involved setting up a thatched shed at the entrance. Wounded individuals would arrive, and each would be registered and examined before entering the ward. This process took a long time, causing suffering to the wounded in the cold. The civilian laborers carrying stretchers often became impatient as well. This time, the Station Hospital devised a new method that was both quick and simple.
    In advance, the hospital prepared many admission tags in various styles: round tags for head injuries, square tags for chest and abdominal injuries, triangular tags for upper limb injuries, and rectangular tags for lower limb injuries. Red tags indicated severe injuries, and blue tags indicated minor injuries. One side of the tag had the patient's registration form, and the other side had the patient's referral letter. Thus, as soon as a wounded individual arrived, the doctor would immediately examine them, classify the injury, and issue a tag. Within just one and a half minutes, the wounded individual could hold the tag and be led by a nurse to the appropriate ward. Then, the registration team would conduct the registration one by one, which was both fast and convenient.
    (2) @@ Functional Therapy
    Although hospital staff members devised various methods to improve bed facilities to alleviate the suffering of the wounded, treating severe bone fractures always felt difficult. Recently, the First Branch of the Mobile Fifth Hospital has widely adopted @@ functional therapy, which has been satisfactory to the wounded and sick and has had good results.
    The method involves attaching hemp ropes to the beams next to the beds of patients with bone fractures, according to the location of the injury, to create @@. The wounded individuals sit on it, using moderate vibration to help blood circulation, gastrointestinal digestion, muscle growth, and fracture recovery, while avoiding bedsores and malnutrition. It can also regulate the spirits of the wounded.
    (3) Promoting New Therapies
    In promoting new therapies, in addition to medical personnel studying and researching, it is also necessary to conduct extensive publicity among the wounded. Because many wounded individuals often see new therapies as the doctor's irresponsibility and criticize them. The West Line Hospital, in order to solve this problem, wrote New Therapy Clapper Talks and publicized them everywhere, such as giving lessons to the wounded and sick to explain the principles of new therapies. Slogans also explained new therapies. In the wards of the Station Hospital, there were many such slogans: "Wound is basically granulation tissue growth, which relies on peace of mind and quiet recuperation. Always remember the doctor's words, more dressing changes do not benefit." In this way, the wounded can understand the benefits of new therapies, making it much easier to promote them.
    (4) Improving Living Conditions
    Improving living conditions is the best way to help treat illnesses. The Fifth Branch of the Mobile Second Hospital paid attention to this, often providing two to three dishes, with many varieties and good taste, and without exceeding the supply standards. Therefore, throughout the long year, no one raised any objections to the food. The reason for this was the high degree of initiative and creativity shown by the cooks. The main methods were: first, respecting the cooks' political status. No one was allowed to adopt sarcastic, abusive, or insulting attitudes, and they were not to be called cooks. Second, the leadership cared about them and helped them solve their difficulties. During marching and camping, units generally found good houses first before casually assigning a place to the cooking squad. When the Fifth Branch camped, they first found better houses near wells for the cooking squad to reduce their work difficulties; they also helped solve the necessary furniture. They also regularly attended their meetings and paid attention to helping them with lessons. Secondly, the wounded and sick managed the food themselves. The food at the Ninth Division of the Mobile Fifth Hospital was entirely managed by the economic committee elected by the wounded and sick. What to eat was completely determined by the representatives sent by each squad together with the economic committee. First, they would solicit everyone's opinion on the food of the previous five days, and then discuss how to arrange the menu for the next five days. Then, they would write a list of what to eat each day and what dishes to have, and post it on the ward, kitchen, and dining hall. Everyone's responsibilities were clear, and the work was convenient.
    (5) Propagandists as Nurses
    In order to improve the education and cultural entertainment of the wounded, the hospitals, without exceeding the staffing principle, organized propaganda teams of twelve to thirty people. The propagandists usually gathered together to write clapper talks, rehearse plays, teach songs, organize evening parties, and conduct current affairs propaganda. During large-scale receptions, they would go deep into the wards and disperse to carry out activities. Some were sent to severely wounded companies for intensive treatment and nursing, while others organized amusement parks in lightly wounded companies, telling stories, clapper talks, or giving lectures for two hours every day, with lightly wounded individuals crowded around, listening with great interest. Some even ran to various wards to report victorious news. When the wounded were discharged (regularly scheduled discharge), they organized evening parties to warmly send them off. Many of their scripts and clapper talks were written by the wounded themselves. When rehearsing plays, if there were not enough people, lightly wounded individuals or staff members would participate. Therefore, they wrote the clapper talks of the wounded, performed the plays of the wounded, wore the clothes of the wounded, spoke the words of the wounded, and lived and worked with the wounded, truly serving the wounded. So, they were very popular with the wounded.
    (6) Library
    The wounded and sick not being able to see books was a problem that had never been well resolved. The Ninth Division of the Mobile Fifth Hospital's method was to write out the book catalog. The nurse would take the catalog and the books. Whoever wanted to read something could just look at the catalog and tell the nurse. They could reach out and get it without even getting out of bed. If they didn't like it, they could exchange it. After reading it by the due date, they would return it to the nurse. If they hadn't finished reading it, they would explain why. This was so convenient that naturally more people read books. Although they only had more than one hundred and twenty books, they were constantly being circulated among the patients, with no book left in private hands or idle at home.
    (7) Consolidating the Dependents' Committee
    In the six months that the Third Branch of the Mobile Sixth Hospital received the wounded and sick, they recognized the special significance of Chinese society and families in consolidating the troops. Therefore, they organized a Dependents' Committee, which played a significant role. The Dependents' Committee was organized specifically to receive the dependents who came to see the wounded. It consisted of a Management Committee, a Reception Committee, an Education Committee, and a Registration Committee of four people. The committee stipulated a set of rules, which were discussed and passed by the masses, and were implemented by the committee. Their division of labor was: when dependents arrived, they first found the Registration Committee to register, stating where they came from, who they were looking for, and what they wanted. Then, the Reception Committee would receive them separately. After the Education Committee had a conversation to understand the dependents' ideological situation and family circumstances, they would explain the hospital's situation and educate the dependents on how to behave when visiting the wounded, and put forward suggestions, and explain the reasons. As for when to talk, etc., it was handled by the Management Committee. This was of great educational help to both the dependents and the wounded, and could prevent inadequate reception of dependents or dependents affecting the troops' morale. Both the wounded and their dependents felt very good, and the troops were consolidated.
    In addition, mass organizations such as the ideological mutual aid group, the outing mutual aid group, and the recreational mutual aid group were active in the wards, which also played a significant role in consolidating the troops.

　　西线医院工作经验
    梅岭
    西线机动第二、第五、第六医院、后方第五医院、兵站医院。此次太原战役中，在“一切为了伤病员舒服满意”的号召下，全体工作人员，以对伤病员的无限热爱，排除困难，很好的完成了任务，并创造了很多宝贵经验，现片断地介绍如下：
    （一）伤员一分半钟进入病房
    过去医院的收容，是在门口搭个草棚，伤员来了，一个个登记检查后，方能进入病房。时间很长，不仅伤员在冷地里受罪。抬担架的民工，也往往等得不耐烦。这次兵站医院想了个新办法，既迅速又简便。
    事先，医院做好许多入院牌，样式很多，圆的代表头部伤，方的代表胸腹伤，三角的代表上肢伤，长方的代表下肢伤，红色的表示重伤，蓝色的表示轻伤。牌的一面贴伤员登记表，另一面贴伤员介绍信。这样，伤员一到，医生马上检查，分清伤类，发给木牌，只要一分半钟，伤员即可持牌，由护士带领，分别送入病室，然后再由登记组，一一进行登记，既快，又省事。
    （二）＠＠机能治疗法
    虽然医院工作同志，想各种办法改进床位设备，以减轻伤员的痛苦，但对重骨拆伤的治疗，总是感到困难。最近机动五院一分院，普遍采取＠＠机能治疗法，伤病员都满意，效果也很好。
    办法是：在骨折伤的病房床位旁边，根据伤位不同，用麻绳系在梁上，做成＠＠，伤员坐在上面，利用适度的振荡运动，可以帮助血液循环，胃肠消化，肌肉生长，骨折复原，避免褥疮与营养不良现象，还可以调剂伤员精神。
    （三）推行新疗法
    推行新疗法，除医务人员学习研究外，还必须在伤员中进行广泛宣传。因为有许多伤员，往往把新疗法看成医生的不负责任现象，而加以责难。西线医院为了解决这个问题，写成新疗法快板，到处宣传，如给伤病员上课，说明新疗法的道理，标语上也解释新疗法，兵站医院病房中，有很多这样的标语：“伤口本是肉芽长，要靠安心静休养，时时记住医生话，换药多了不沾光，”这样，可以使伤员懂得新疗法的好处，推行就便利得多。
    （四）改善生活
    改善生活是帮助疗养疾病最好的办法，机动二院五分院就注意了这一点，经常能吃到二个到三个菜，花样很多，味道又好，而且消耗又不超出供给标准。因此在长长的一年中，没有任何人对火食提出意见。这原因就是高度的发扬了炊事员的积极性和创造性。主要办法是：第一，尊重炊事员的政治地位，任何人不能采取讽刺漫骂侮辱等态度，不准叫火夫。第二，领导上关心他们，帮助他们解决了困难。在行军宿营时，一般的总是各单位找好房子后，再给炊事班随便安置个地方。五分院宿营时，首先给炊事班找较好的又靠近水井的房子，以减少炊事员的工作困难；必要的家具，也帮助解决。还经常参加他们的会，注意帮他们上课。其次是伤病员自己管理火食。机动五院九所的火食，全是由伤病员自己选出来的经济委员会管理的，吃什么，完全由各班派代表同经济委员会共同研究，首先征求大家对前五天火食的意见，再讨论后五天菜单怎样排法，然后每天吃什么饭什么菜都写个单子，贴在病房、火房与饭堂上。大家职责清楚，工作方便。
    （五）宣传员兼护士
    为提高对伤员的教育与文化误乐，医院在不超过编制原则下，都组织了由十二人至三十人的宣传队。宣传员平时集中在一起，编快板，排剧，教歌，组织晚会，进行时事宣传。大收容时即深入病房，分散活动，有的派到重伤连，突击治疗，护理伤号，有的在轻伤连，组织游艺场，每天说书，说快板，或讲故事两小时，轻伤员围满一大圈，非常爱听：有的还去各病房跑，专门报告胜利消息。在伤员出院时（定期出院），就组织晚会，热烈欢送，他们的剧本快板，有许多是伤员编的，排剧时，如人数不够，也有轻伤员或工作人员参加。因此编的是伤病员的快板，演的是伤病员的戏，穿的是伤病员的衣服，说的是伤病员的话，生活工作都与伤病员混在一起，真正的做到了为伤病员服务。所以很受伤病员欢迎。
    （六）图书馆
    伤病员，看不到书，是从来没有很好解决的问题。机动五院九所的办法是把图书目录写出来，护士拿着目录，带着书，谁想看什么，只要看看目录，与护士说一声，一伸手，连床都不起，就可以拿到，不好，可以换。到期看完后，交给护士，没有看完，说明一下。这样方便，看书的人自然多了，虽然他们只有一百二十多种书，却能时时在病员手中轮着看，没有一本留在私人手中，或者在家闲着。
    （七）巩固部队的家属委员会
    机动六院三分院，在接收伤病员的半年中，他们认识了中国的社会，家庭对巩固部队有着特殊意义，所以组织了家属委员会，起了很大作用。家属委员会，是为了专门招待来看伤员的家属而组织的，内设管理委员、招待委员、教育委员、登记委员四人。委员会规定了一套制度，经过群众讨论通过，由委员会负责执行。他们的分工是：家属一来，首先找登记委员进行登记，说明那里来的？找谁？有什么事？再由招待委员分别招待，经过教育委员谈过话，了解家属思想情况、家庭情形后，再说明医院情况并教育家属探视伤员时，应该采取如何态度，提出意见，说明道理，至于什么时间谈话等则由管理委员接洽。这样对家属和伤员的教育与帮助都很大，可以防止对家属招待不周，或家属影响部队战斗情绪等现象发生。无论伤员与家属都感觉很好，而部队又巩固了。
    此外伤病员中思想互助组，外出互助组，文娱互助组等群众组织，在病房中广泛活动，对巩固部队也起了很大作用。
