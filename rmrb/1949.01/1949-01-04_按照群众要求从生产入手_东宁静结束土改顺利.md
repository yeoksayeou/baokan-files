　　Starting with Production According to the Demands of the Masses
  　Dong Ningjing Successfully Concludes Land Reform
    [Taihang News] The Dong Ningjing Village work team in the Second District of Xiangyuan County corrected the deviation of not combining the conclusion of land reform with winter production, thus enabling the work to proceed smoothly. The village has stony and thin soil, and the villagers are impoverished. Most villagers rely on sideline occupations such as cutting branches, weaving, going down coal kilns, and carrying burdens in the winter and spring to supplement their livelihoods. When the work team first arrived in the village, they did not understand this situation and blindly held meetings to carry out the conclusion of land reform. Farmer Li Wajin said, "I heard that it will take a month to complete the land reform. This is not good! In our village, cutting branches on the mountains is equivalent to a season's worth of grain. If we hold meetings for a month, plus a few heavy snows, we will be finished this year!" The village branch also had the same reaction. After hearing these opinions, the work team immediately held a meeting to review their mistakes and shifted to starting from the urgent demands of the farmers. They convened a village branch meeting to specifically study the winter production and the conclusion of the land reform. It was decided that cadres and party members would be specifically assigned to lead. In addition to a few cadres remaining in the village to lead the farmers who had no labor to deliberate and discuss, the remaining cadres and party members led nine groups of sixty-one farmers to cut branches on the mountains, nine people to sell tofu, nine people to go down coal kilns, and eleven people to carry burdens. Some also went to transport coal, collect firewood, and scrape barren grass to smoke the soil. While working, they solicited farmers' opinions on land reform, understood farmers' ideological problems, and combined this with propaganda, education, and organizational work. The farmers were very satisfied with this approach. According to statistics, the entire village can cut 2,440 catties of branches in one day, which can be sold for 1,500 yuan in new currency, solving practical difficulties in their lives. In this way, the farmers' enthusiasm for attending meetings also increased. As soon as they heard the notice, they actively participated. One farmer said, "In this way, both winter production and the conclusion of land reform can be done well."

　　按照群众要求从生产入手
  　东宁静结束土改顺利
    【太行讯】襄垣二区东宁静村工作组纠正结束土改不与冬季生产结合的偏向，使工作顺利进行。该村石厚土薄，生活贫困，村民大部分靠冬春两季上山割条、编织、下煤窑、担挑等副业补足生活。工作组初到村时不了解这种情况，盲目开会搞结束土改，农民黎瓦金说：“听说结束土地改革要一个月才能完成，这可不行呀！咱村上山割条顶一季谷，这样开一个月会，再不下几场大雪，今年就完啦！”村支部也有同样反映。工作组听到这些意见后，立即开会作了检讨，转而从农民迫切要求入手，召开村支部会议，将冬季生产与土地改革结束工作作了具体研究。决定干部党员具体分工，分别领导。除少数干部留村领导没有劳动力的农民酝酿讨论外，其余干部党员领导了九个组、六十一个农民上山割条，九个人卖豆腐，九个人下煤窑，十一个人担挑。还有的去驮煤、打柴、刮荒草熏土。一面劳动，一面即征求农民对土改的意见，了解农民思想上的问题，结合进行宣传教育与组织工作。农民对这种作法都很满意。据统计，全村一天能割条二千四百四十斤，可卖新币一千五百元，解决了生活上的实际困难。这样农民对开会情绪也提高了。只要一听通知，即积极参加，一个农民说：“这样，冬季生产与结束土地改革工作保险都能作好。”
