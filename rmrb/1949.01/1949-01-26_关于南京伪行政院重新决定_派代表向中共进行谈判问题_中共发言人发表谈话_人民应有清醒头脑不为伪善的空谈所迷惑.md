Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 25th: According to a report by the Central News Agency of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government on the 22nd, the Executive Yuan of this reactionary government overturned its own absurd resolution made on the 19th that it was unwilling to negotiate without first ceasing hostilities. It has re-decided to send five representatives to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party. These five representatives are Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shao＠, Peng Zhaoxian, and Zhong Tianxin. The CCP spokesperson stated: We are willing to negotiate with the Nanjing reactionary government on the peaceful resolution of the issue on the basis of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation on January 14th. The Nanjing reactionary government should bear full responsibility for launching the counter-revolutionary civil war. The people of the whole country have long since completely lost confidence in this government, and this government is no longer qualified to represent the Chinese people. The only government qualified to represent the Chinese people is the democratic coalition government to be produced by the upcoming new Political Consultative Conference without the participation of reactionaries. Therefore, our allowing the Nanjing reactionary government to send representatives to negotiate with us is not an acknowledgment that this government is still qualified to represent the Chinese people, but because this government still has a part of the reactionary remnant military forces in its hands. If this government feels that it has completely lost the trust of the people, and feels that the remaining reactionary military forces in its hands are unable to resist the powerful People's Liberation Army, and is willing to accept the CCP's eight peace conditions, then, of course, it is better and more beneficial to the people's liberation cause to solve the problem through negotiation and reduce the suffering of the people. The recent peaceful resolution of the Peiping issue is an example. However, no one knows now whether the Nanjing reactionary government is willing to accept the eight conditions put forward by the CCP that reflect the public opinion of the people of the whole country. What is known now is that the Nanjing reactionary government is releasing a lot of hypocritical, pretentious peace airs, attempting to deceive the people in order to achieve its goal of preserving its reactionary forces, gaining a respite, and then making a comeback to extinguish the revolutionary forces. The people of the whole country should have a clear head and must not be deceived by those hypocritical empty talks. The location of the negotiations will be determined after Peiping is completely liberated, and will probably be in Peiping. Peng Zhaoxian is one of the main cadres of the Kuomintang "CC" clique, who is the most forceful in advocating war. People consider him a war criminal, and the CCP cannot receive such a representative. Regarding the list of war criminals, the CCP spokesperson stated that we have not yet published the complete list of war criminals. The list published by Xinhua News Agency on December 25 last year was only the first batch, and the main responsible personnel in the Kuomintang reactionaries who launched the civil war and massacred the people are definitely not just forty-three.

　　关于南京伪行政院重新决定
    派代表向中共进行谈判问题
    中共发言人发表谈话
  　人民应有清醒头脑不为伪善的空谈所迷惑
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据南京国民党反动政府的中央通讯社二十二日报导，这个反动政府的行政院已于二十二日推翻了它自己在十九日所作若不先行停战便不愿意进行谈判的那个荒谬决议，而重新决定派遣五个代表向中国共产党进行谈判。这五个代表是邵力子、张治中、黄绍＠、彭昭贤、钟天心。中共发言人称：我们愿意在一月十四日毛泽东主席对时局声明的基础之上和南京反动政府谈判和平解决的问题。南京反动政府应负发动反革命内战的全部责任，全国人民对于这个政府早已完全丧失信任，这个政府早已没有代表中国人民的资格。有资格代表中国人民的政府，只能是由即将召开的没有反动分子参加的新的政治协商会议所产生的民主联合政府。因此，我们允许南京反动政府派出代表和我们进行谈判，不是承认这个政府还有代表中国人民的资格，而是因为这个政府手里还有一部分反动的残余军事力量。如果这个政府感于自己已经完全丧失人民的信任，感于它手里的残余反动军事力量已经无法抵抗强大的人民解放军，而愿意接受中共的八个和平条件的话，那么，用谈判的方法去解决问题，使人民少受痛苦，当然是比较好的和有利于人民解放事业的。最近北平问题的和平解决，就是一个实例。但是，南京反动政府是否愿意接受中共所提出的反映全国人民公意的八个条件，现在谁也不知道。现在所知道的，就是在南京反动政府方面放出了许多虚伪的装腔作势的和平空气，企图欺骗人民，以达其保存反动势力，获得喘息机会，然后卷土重来，扑灭草命力量之目的。全国人民应有清醒的头脑，决不可被那些伪善的空谈所迷惑。谈判的地点，要待北平完全解放后才能确定，大约将在北平。彭昭贤是主战最力的国民党“ＣＣ”派的主要干部之一，人们认为是一个战争罪犯，中共方面不能接待这样的代表。关于战争罪犯名单问题，中共发言人称，我们尚未发表全部战争罪犯名单，去年十二月二十五日新华社发表的仅仅是第一批名单，发动内战残杀人民的国民党反动派中的主要负责人员决不止四十三个。
