　　"Inquiries and Replies" Have Been of Great Help to Me
    Editor:
    I am a reader from Xingtai City, and I enjoy reading newspapers very much. I am extremely interested in the study of policies and regulations. After reading the news every day, I immediately turn to columns such as "Reader-Editor Interactions," "Voices of the Masses," "Criticism and Suggestions," and "Inquiries and Replies." After more than a year of study, I feel that the People's Daily has been of great help to me. Starting from January 1st, the newspaper will regularly publish four pages. I think these columns should be expanded to widely solicit public opinion. Regarding the "Voices of the Masses" and "Criticism and Suggestions," efforts should be made to ensure that the relevant government departments promptly adopt and fulfill the suggestions, conduct reviews and corrections, and that local governments also promptly handle matters transferred to them for resolution, without delay or neglect, so as not to affect the morale of the masses and avoid becoming a mere formality and occupying space. You are widely soliciting readers' opinions. I am just writing these few words as a New Year's greeting.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A Reader from Xingtai City

### “询问与答复”对我帮助很大

专栏：

　　“询问与答复”对我帮助很大
    编辑同志：
    我是邢台市一读者，我很喜读报章，对于政策法令的研究，极感兴趣。每天看罢新闻后，即翻阅编读往来、群众呼声、批评与建议、询问与答复等栏，经过年余的学习，自觉人民日报对我帮助很大。从一月一日起要经常出四版，我认为应该扩大这几个专栏，广征民意。对于群众呼声、批评建议，务使有关政府及时采纳兑现与检讨纠正，及转地方解决的事情，也要当地政府及时处理，不要拖延不管，影响群众情绪，以免流于形式，徒占篇幅。你们广泛征求读者意见，仅写这几句，作为新年之贺礼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　邢台市一读者
