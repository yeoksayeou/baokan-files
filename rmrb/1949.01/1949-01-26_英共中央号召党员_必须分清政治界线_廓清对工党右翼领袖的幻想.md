Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 24th. Reuter, London, January 16th: The Central Committee of the British Communist Party has recently released a statement on the political situation for members to discuss. The statement says: The British Communist Party must stand in the position of leading the working class. To this end, "the Party must eliminate the illusions arising from the anti-fascist united struggle, namely, that the working class can advance without a resolute struggle against capitalism and the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party." The statement points out that these illusions continued until after the 1945 general election. The statement emphasizes that it is necessary to draw clear political lines, but not to attack the entire membership of the Labor Party. The statement declares: "To attempt to portray the general members, city councilors, and members of parliament of the Labor Party as pro-reactionary masses is defeatism and sectarianism." While the Communist Party should strive to isolate and defeat the right-wing elements of the Labor Party and their policies, it should also fully support every member of parliament who fights for class policies.

The statement points out that Anglo-American imperialism cannot thwart the growth of democratic and peaceful forces, and their entire policy exacerbates the conflicts and contradictions of imperialism. This policy and its huge military expenditures "aggravate economic difficulties and increase Britain's maximum dependence on the United States." The Central Committee predicts that what will follow will be attacks on the wages and living standards of British workers and unemployment. The statement continues: The Labor government's foreign policy, supported by the Conservative Party, and Cripps' economic policy, require them to implement the policies of monopoly capital and imperialism. "This is the background to the anti-communist movement in trade unions, and is part of the preparation for attacking communists in trade unions." The statement continues: To defeat the offensive of monopoly capitalism, "Communists must prove to the working class that an attack on communists in trade unions is an attack on the democratic rights of trade unionists." Trade unionists around the world are opposing the movement to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee calls for the broadest support for this movement.

The statement then puts forward a unified program to unite all labor movements and all democratic forces, calls for the development of a mass movement to fight for peace and friendship with the Soviet Union, puts the development of the Communist Party in factories at the forefront, makes factories the main base of the Party's strength, strengthens trade union organizations in factories, obtains and expands the Communist Party's leadership in trade unions, increases the Communist Party's representation in local governments and parliaments, accelerates the recruitment of party members and Communist Youth League members in all aspects, and strengthens the Marxist viewpoints of party cadres and party members through more systematic educational work, and studies and publicizes the achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The British Communist Party also issued a policy on the municipal and county council elections to be held this spring, determining that the party's "main task in future elections is to implement an independent mass movement for genuine socialist policies." The Communist Party insists on making the greatest efforts to recommend "as many local candidates as possible and one hundred candidates for members of parliament" in the general election.

　　英共中央号召党员
  　必须分清政治界线
  　廓清对工党右翼领袖的幻想
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】电通社伦敦十六日讯：英国共产党中央委员会顷公布发给党员讨论的关于政治形势的声明。声明称：英国共产党必须站在领导工人阶级的地位。为此，“党必须廓清由反法西斯统一斗争所产生的幻想，即以为工人阶级可以不与资本主义和工党右翼领袖作坚决的斗争向前进展”。声明指出：这些幻想一直继续到一九四五年大选以后。声明强调必须在政治上分清界线，但不可攻击整个工党的党员。声明宣称：“企图把工党一般党员和市议员和国会议员都描述为亲反动派的群众，乃是失败主义和宗派主义。”共产党一方面应努力孤立并击败工党右翼分子及其政策，同时应全力支持每一个为阶级政策而奋斗的议员。
    声明指出：英美帝国主义并不能顿挫民主与和平力量的增长，他们的全部政策，加剧了帝国主义的冲突与矛盾。这一政策及其巨大的军事费用，“加剧了经济困难，并增加了英国对美国的最大的依赖”。中央委员会预言，继之而来的将是对英国工人工资和生活标准的进攻以及失业。声明继称：为保守党所支持的工党政府的外交政策和克利浦斯的经济政策，使他们必须实行垄断资本和帝国主义的政策。“这就是职工会中反共运动的背景，是进攻职工会中共产党人的准备工作的一部分。”声明继称：为要挫败垄断资本主义的攻势，“共产党人必须向工人阶级证明，在职工会中对共产党人的进攻，便是对职工运动者民主权利的进攻”。全世界职工正在反对破坏世界工联的运动，中央委员会要求给这个运动以最广泛的支持。
    声明接着提出团聚一切劳工运动和一切民主力量的统一的纲领，号召开展争取和平与对苏友谊的群众运动，把共产党在工厂中的发展提到最前列，把工厂作为党的力量的主要基地，加强工厂中的工会组织，取得并扩大共产党人在工会中的领导地位，增加共产党在地方政府和议会中的代表，加速在各方面吸收党员和共产主义青年团员，经过更有系统的教育工作以加强党的干部和党员群众的马克思主义观点，研究并宣传苏联和人民民主国家的成就。英共同时颁布一项有关今春举行的市议会和郡议会选举的方针，确定党在将来选举中的“主要任务是为真正的社会主义政策而贯彻独立的群众运动”。共产党坚持尽最大努力推荐大选中“尽可能多的地方候选人，和一百名国会议员候选人。”
