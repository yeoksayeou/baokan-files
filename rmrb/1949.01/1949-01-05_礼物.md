　　Cǎi Bēn
　　On December 10th last year, during the fierce battle to encircle and annihilate the Chiang bandit Huang Wei's army corps, two small teams of the People's Liberation Army from different establishments were firmly holding the transportation trench at Xiazhuang southeast of Dawangzhuang. On the right flank was a company of a certain unit of the Central Plains Field Army, and on the left flank were two platoons led by Xu Zhixiang, the political instructor of the first company of a certain regiment of the East China Field Army. After a fierce battle that night, the main force of the 33rd Regiment of the 18th Army of the Chiang bandits, which had been entrenched in Dawangzhuang, was annihilated, and these two teams were ordered to hold the captured position. The next morning, they bravely and stubbornly fought the enemy's infantry tanks twice, never retreating a single step. At this time, Xu Zhixiang, the political instructor of the East China Field Army, frowned tightly, anxiously facing two difficult problems that were not easy to solve: one was that the ammunition was running out due to the intense battle, and it could not be resupplied in time; the other was that the machine gunner Liu Guibao had been killed and the platoon leader Chen Jinfu had been wounded, so there was a machine gun sitting idle without anyone to use it. The company commander of the Central Plains Field Army, which was only a dozen meters away from the East China Field Army, heard these difficulties and told Xu Zhixiang in a straightforward and friendly tone: "We have bullets here, take them and use them! We are all on the same side, and we are all here to eliminate the enemy." The soldier who was sent to carry the bullets used a lot of strength, but couldn't carry this big bag of "gifts", so he had to drag it step by step along the transportation trench. At the same time, a bottle of gun oil gifted by the Central Plains Field Army was also handed over to Xu Zhixiang. The first difficulty was solved, and a smile could not help but crack on the corner of Xu Zhixiang's mouth. "But what about the second difficulty?" Just as worry resurfaced on Xu Zhixiang's brow, he suddenly heard a voice coming from the Central Plains unit's position: "May I ask your political instructor, is that machine gun idle? Can we borrow it?" After this sentence was passed on by many soldiers, Xu Zhixiang immediately ordered the soldiers to pass the idle machine gun over there. After a while, the soldiers of the East China Field Army saw the gunner on the other side loading the bullets into their "gift" and firing fiercely at the enemy, while the machine gunner of the East China Field Army also loaded a magazine onto the "gift" sent by the Central Plains unit, firing it carefully. These two small teams stared at the "gifts" sent by each other, and at the same time felt a deep friendship.

　　礼物
    采贲
    去年十二月十日，在围歼蒋匪黄维兵团的激烈战斗中，有解放军不同建制的两支小队伍，坚守在大王庄东南下庄交通沟里的，右翼是中原野战军某部的一个连，左翼是华东野战军某团一连指导员徐志祥所率领的两个排。当日夜里经过一场恶战，困踞大王庄的蒋匪十八军主力三十三团六部被消灭后，这两支队伍就奉命坚守着这个既得阵地。第二天上午，他们又勇猛顽强地和敌人的步兵坦克搏斗了两次，始终没有后退一步。这时，华东野战军的徐指导员紧紧地锁拢眉头，焦急着摆在面前不易解决的两个困难，一个是由于战斗太激烈子弹快打光了，而后面一时补给不上；另一个是机枪射手刘贵宝牺牲了和排长陈金福负伤了，有一挺机枪摆着没人使用。相距华东野战军部队只不过十几米达的中原野战军的连长，听到这些困难后，即以一种爽快而亲切的口吻，告诉徐指导员说：“我们这里有子弹，拿去使吧！都是自己的，都是为了消灭敌人。”被派去扛子弹的战士，使了很大的力气，也没扛动这一大口袋的“礼物”，只好顺着交通沟，一步步地拖回来。同时交给徐指导员的还有中原野战军相赠的一瓶擦枪油。第一个困难解决了，徐指导员嘴角上不禁裂开了笑纹。“但是第二个困难呢”？当愁虑又重新锁上徐指导员的眉头时，他忽然听见中原部队的阵地上传来了话：“请问你们指导员，那挺机枪可闲着吗？借给我们使使行吗？”这句话经很多战士传过来，徐指导员马上命令战士将那挺闲着的机枪传递过去。过了一会，华东野战军的战士看见那边的射手把子弹梭装在他们的“礼物”里，向敌人猛烈地射击，而华东野战军的机枪射手也给中原部队送来的“礼物”压上一梭，珍惜地射击着。这两支小队伍各自凝视着对方送的“礼物”不约而同的感受着一种深挚的友情。
