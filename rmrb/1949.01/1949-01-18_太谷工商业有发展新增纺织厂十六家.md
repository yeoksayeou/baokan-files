Taigu Industry and Commerce Develops, Sixteen New Textile Factories Added
[Report from this newspaper] Taigu’s urban industry and commerce have moved from closures and shutdowns before liberation to recovery and development. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were 780 established merchants in the city. At that time, the largest grain stores and medicinal material stores had branches in major cities and ports across the country. By the time of Japan's surrender, the number of merchants had decreased to 361. During the period of the Yan bandit rule, it further decreased to 263. After Taigu was liberated last year, industry and commerce were able to recover and develop through the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies, reduction of corvée labor, implementation of free trade, and public purchase and public sales by the People's Government. According to statistics at the end of November last year, the number of industrial and commercial households had increased from 263 before liberation to 658, more than one and a half times the number before liberation. Among these recovered and developed industrial and commercial enterprises, sixteen new textile factories have been added, marking the beginning of industrial construction in Taigu City. There are 68 handicraft households, 71 workshops, and more than 170 stores engaged in general merchandise, groceries, medicinal materials, and mountain products. The current problem is that small vendors and poor citizens are not subject to corvée labor in the corvée policy. For example, all corvée labor in the northeast area is borne by large merchants, and not a single citizen or vendor is involved. Some industrial and commercial households are afraid of corvée labor and reduce their business or break it up into small stalls. Therefore, small vendors account for a considerable proportion now, including 209 family vendors. This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently.

　　太谷工商业有发展新增纺织厂十六家
    【本报讯】太谷城关工商业由解放前的倒闭歇业走向恢复发展。抗战前该城原有座商七百八十户，当时最大的粮行、药材行等在全国各大城市、港口多设有买卖，至日本投降时期，商户减为三百六十一户，至阎匪统治期间，更减为二百六十三户。去年太谷解放后，经人民政府废除苛杂、减轻差役、实行自由贸易、公买公卖，工商业遂得恢复和发展。据去年十一月底统计，工商业已由解放前的二百六十三户增加到六百五十八户。超过了解放前一倍半。在恢复与发展了的这些工商业中，新增加十六家纺织工厂，这是太谷城工业建设的开端。手工业六十八户，作坊七十一户，百货、杂货、药材、山货等业共一百七十余家。目前存在的问题：在支差政策上小摊贩及贫苦市民均不支差，如东北堆支差全部是大商户，市民摊贩未走一人。有些工商户怕支差，，把营业缩小或分散成小摊。因此现在小摊贩占相当比重，连家庭摊贩在内共有二百零九户之多。这是即待解决的问题。
