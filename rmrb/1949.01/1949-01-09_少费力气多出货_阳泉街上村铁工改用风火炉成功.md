　　Less Effort, More Output
　　Yangquan Street Shangcun Ironworkers Successfully Switch to Blast Furnaces
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Shi Xiuzhong, the chairman of the trade union in Shangcun, Shangying Street, Yangquan, visited the blast furnaces and large pots in Shandicun, Meng County, and found them to be much better than the local-made furnaces and pots. So, after returning to the village, he discussed the matter with the production director, Shi Gen-suo, to organize the village's local furnace workers to switch to blast furnaces and Sichuan pots. However, many people didn't believe it and were afraid of losing money. After patient persuasion and mobilization, only twenty-four workers agreed to give it a try. The twenty-four people were divided into five groups, and production committee member Shi Gen-suo was elected as the manager, responsible for promoting finished products and purchasing raw materials; Shi Xi-mao and Wu Niu-xiao were elected as technical instructors, and the trade union chairman was still in charge of organizational leadership and appropriately adjusting workers' work. The funds mainly came from village cooperative loans, and the rest was from workers investing with their labor. Starting from the third day of the tenth lunar month, they began to tidy up the furnace yard, adjust tools, and ask the sand turning yard to cast new furnaces. In addition, they bought some parts from Lihua Company and installed the blast furnace. They officially started work on the tenth. The first day was a trial run, and in addition to [producing] iron and lead tools, [they] produced four loads of Sichuan pots. Afterwards, it increased day by day. In ten days, they produced over thirty pieces and one hundred and fifty loads of Sichuan pots. Recently, they can produce eighteen to twenty loads per day, which is three to five furnaces more than with local furnaces. The goods are good, and people save much more effort. The workers are very happy.

　　少费力气多出货
  　阳泉街上村铁工改用风火炉成功
    【本报讯】阳泉上荫营街上村的工会主任史修忠，到盂县山底村参观风火炉和大锅，发现比土造炉＠大锅强多了。于是回村后与生产主任史根锁商量，组织本村土炉工人，改用风火炉＠川锅。但是很多人不相信，怕赔钱。经过耐心的说服动员，才有二十四个工人答应试把试把。二十四个人分成五个小组，选出生产委员史根锁为经理，负责推销成品，购买原料；又选出史喜猫、武牛小为技术指导员，工会主任还是管组织领导、适当调剂工人工作。资金主要是村合作社贷款，另外就是工人用劳动力入股。从旧历十月初三开始整理炉场、调剂工具、请翻沙场倒新炉子，另外还在利华公司买了些零件，就把风火炉按好了。初十就正式开了工。第一天试样，除＠铁铅工具外，＠成四驮川锅，以后就一天天的增加，十天的工夫，共＠成它三十余件，川锅一百五十驮。最近每天能＠十八驮到二十驮，比土炉多出三炉到五炉。货还好，人还省劲得多，工友们高兴的很。
