Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: “Decision of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions on the Issue of Union Membership Dues,” the text is as follows:

　　Trade unions are organizations of the working masses themselves, and paying membership dues is the obligation of every union member. Union cadres should understand the important significance of collecting membership dues. The most important significance and role of membership dues lies in consolidating members' organizational awareness and expressing their love for the union. On the other hand, it lies in strengthening the connection between the union and the masses. Because members pay membership dues, and the membership dues are used for the daily work of the union, they will inevitably feel that the union is their own, and thus they will closely care about the union and boldly supervise the work of the union. In addition, because the union is a mass organization, the daily expenses of the union should be paid from membership dues, and should not rely on the government or factory for a long time. This is also an important issue concerning whether the union is truly an organization of the masses themselves.

　　Due to the existence of residual habits left over from the guerrilla environment, and due to the lack of understanding of this issue by some cadres, the collection and expenditure of membership dues in various places not only have not established a normal system, but are even abnormally chaotic in some places. For example, there are no accounts, no procedures, no dedicated personnel in charge, no scope of expenses, and no reports to members and higher-level unions. Some individual unions have never collected membership dues, so that members not only do not understand the meaning of membership dues, but even do not know that paying membership dues is an obligation of members. This phenomenon is not in line with the principles of trade union organization. In order to overcome the above-mentioned phenomena and give play to the due role of union membership dues, the following provisions are made on the issues of collection, custody, use, reporting, and supervision:

　　1. Methods for collecting membership dues: (1) All employees who join the union as members must pay monthly union membership dues equal to one percent of their wage income (including both in-kind and monetary payments, and paid in currency). Those who fail to pay membership dues for more than three months without reason will be regarded as having automatically withdrawn from the union. (2) Membership dues can be collected when wages are paid out each month. (3) Each union must formulate a unified membership dues receipt form and issue it to each member. The person collecting membership dues must fill in the amount on the receipt and sign it when receiving the payment. (4) Membership dues are collected by the union group leader or a person designated by the group leader, who then prepares a list, calculates the total amount of membership dues collected, and hands it over to the union organization secretary, who then hands it over to the union organization department, which then deposits it with the accounting section. (5) When the union organization department receives the membership dues, it should issue a three-part receipt, one for the group collector, one for the accounting section, and one for retention. (6) Each lower-level union must pay 30% of the membership dues collected to the industrial union or retain them for the local federation of trade unions. If they are affiliated with both organizations, then 20% should be paid to the industrial union and 10% to the local federation of trade unions. (7) Each industrial union and local federation of trade unions must pay 30% of the membership dues collected to the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. This should be remitted every three months.

　　2. Distribution and scope of use of membership dues: (1) Membership dues payable to higher-level unions each month. (2) Union daily office expenses (including publicity expenses). (3) Living expenses for union staff who are detached from production (union cadres who are not detached from production may be given a subsidy from membership dues if union work takes up too much time and affects their wage income). (4) Expenses for running employee welfare undertakings. (5) The following types of expenses must not be paid from membership dues: (A) Labor insurance fees. (B) Cultural and educational expenses.

　　3. Accounting, custody, and reporting system for membership dues: (1) Each level of the union should have detailed accounting records and should set up an independent accounting department to formulate an accurate accounting, custody, and budget system. (2) The expenditure of various expenses should be budgeted as a percentage and submitted to the executive committee for review and approval. At the grassroots level, it shall be approved by the union committee. (3) Each level of the union should announce the income and expenditure accounts of membership dues to its members on a monthly basis and make a summary every six months. A report should also be prepared and reported to the higher-level union. (4) Each industrial union and provincial and municipal federation of trade unions must submit a copy of the membership dues report to the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions every three months for review.

　　4. Supervision and review system for membership dues: (1) Each union should elect a review committee of three to five people at the members' meeting or representatives' meeting to regularly review and supervise the income and expenditure accounts and use of membership dues. The monthly published accounts must be signed by the union director, accountant, and review committee member to be responsible. (2) Higher-level unions have the right to review the income and expenditure accounts and use of membership dues of affiliated unions.

　　5. Supplementary Provisions: (1) This decision was adopted by the Standing Committee of the Federation and will be implemented from January 1949. If there is any impropriety, it will be discussed and revised by the Standing Committee of the Federation. The right of interpretation belongs to the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. (2) Other interpretations of local unions regarding membership dues issues, if they conflict with this decision, shall be corrected according to this decision.

### 东北职工总会　关于工会会费问题的决定

　　东北职工总会
  　关于工会会费问题的决定
    【新华社沈阳电】“东北职工总会关于工会会费问题的决定”，文如下：
    工会是职工群众自己的组织，缴纳会费是每个工会会员的义务，而工会干部更应了解征收会费的重要意义。会费最重要的意义和作用，在于巩固会员的组织观念，表示他们对工会的爱护。另一方面，则是在于加强工会与群众的联系。因为会员缴了会费，而会费又是用在工会日常工作上的，那末他们必然会感到工会是他们自己的，因而就会亲密地关心工会和大胆地监督工会工作。另外，因为工会是群众团体，工会日常经费应该从会费中开支，而不应长期仰赖于政府或工厂来解决。这也是一个有关工会是否真正群众自己组织的重要问题。
    由于受期游击环境所遗留的残余习惯的存在，再由于某些干部对这一问题的认识不足，目前各地工会对于会费的征收与开支等，不但没有建立正常的制度，有些地方甚至异常混乱。如没有帐目、没有手续，负责没有专人，开支没有范围，向会员和上级工会也从不报告，甚至有个别工会，从未征收会费，致使会员不但不了解会费意义，而且连缴纳会费是会员应有义务也不知道。这种现象，是不符合工会组织原则的。为了克服上述现象，发挥工会会费应有的作用，特就征收、保管、用途、报告、监督等问题作如下规定：
    一、征收会费的办法：（一）凡加入工会为会员的职工，须按月向工会缴纳等于工资收入（包括实物和货币合计而以货币缴纳之）百分之一的会费，如逾三月无故不缴会费者，作自动退会论。（二）会员会费，可于每月发放工资时征收之。（三）各工会须制定统一的会费收据表发给每个会员，征收会费人收款时须在收据上填明数目并签字。（四）会费由工会小组长或由组长指定专人负责征收，然后开列名单，计算所收会费总数，统一交给工会组织干事，由组织干事再交工会组织部，再由组织部交存会计科。（五）各工会组织部于收到会费时，应开具三联收据，一送小组征收人，一送会计科，一留作存根。（六）各下层工会须将所收会费百分之三十缴纳产业总工会或留地方总工会，同是隶属于上述两种组织者，则以百分之二十缴纳产业总工会，百分之十缴纳地方总工会。（七）各产业总工会与地方总工会须将所收会费百分之三十缴纳东北职工总会。每三个月汇交一次。
    二、会费支配及用途范围：（一）每月应向上级工会缴纳之会费。（二）工会日常办公费（包括宣传费）。（三）脱离生产的工会职员生活费（不脱离生产的工会干部，如因工会工作占去时间过多，影响其工资收入者，可酌情在会费内予以贴补）。（四）举办职工福利事业费。（五）属于下列用途之费用，不得在会费内开支：（甲）劳动保险费。（乙）文化教育费。
    三、会费的会计保管与报告制度：（一）各级工会应有详细的会计帐目，应特设一独立会计，制定一精确的会计、保管及预算制度。（二）各项经费之开支，应以百分比制定预算，提交执行委员会审核通过。基层工会则由工会委员会通过。（三）各级工会应按月向所属会员公布会费收支帐目，每半年作一总结。并造具报告书，报告上级工会。（四）各产业总工会及各省市职工总会，须每三个月向东北职工总会制送会费报告书一份，以备审查。
    四、会费的监督与审查制：（一）各工会应在会员大会或代表大会上选举三人至五人的审查委员会，经常审查与监督会费收支帐目与使用情况。在每月公布之帐目上须有工会主任、会计和审查委员签字负责。（二）上级工会有审查所属工会关于会费收支帐目与使用情况之权。
    五、附则：（一）本决定经本会常委会通过并于一九四九年一月份起公布施行，如有不妥处，由本会常委会讨论修改之。其解释权属于东北职工总会。（二）各地工会有关会费问题之其他解释，如有与本决定有抵触者，以本决定为标准加以改正。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　东北职工总会　　　一月九日
