Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 18th: A late-breaking dispatch from Zhengzhou: The Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau has rectified revolutionary discipline and punished Liu Zhaolin, a former staff member, for his misdeeds. Liu used to be a plainclothes detective in the Kuomintang Zhengzhou Garrison Headquarters, and consistently extorted money from the masses, never paying when seeing plays or taking baths. After the liberation of Zhengzhou, he registered with the Public Security Bureau, expressing his willingness to repent and requesting work. The Zhengzhou People's Municipal Government Public Security Bureau gave him a chance to turn over a new leaf, allowing him to serve in the bureau in the hope that he could redeem himself through meritorious service. However, Liu did not correct his bad habits. On the 24th of last month, he insisted on owing money when taking a bath at the Da Zhonghua Bathhouse. On the 27th, when he went to take a bath again, he refused to acknowledge the previous debt and refused to pay. When Zhao Chunhe, a worker at the bathhouse, asked him for the money, he told Zhao to go to the Public Security Bureau to get the money, intending to use the name of the "Public Security Bureau" to threaten the worker. However, Zhao Chunhe had a good understanding of the People's Government, saying, "If the Kuomintang were here, I wouldn't dare to ask for it, but now it's the People's Government, so I'm not afraid of you." Liu became enraged and eventually took Zhao Chunhe to the police brigade. Tian Jinwen, the manager of the bathhouse, followed and interceded with Liu before bringing Zhao back. After this incident occurred, the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a letter from Zhang Zhiping, a member of the preparatory committee of the Zhengzhou Municipal Trade Union, and immediately interrogated Liu Zhaolin. Liu not only refused to admit his mistake but also falsely accused Zhao Chunhe of damaging his reputation, claiming that he would sue in court and publish a statement in the newspaper. The bureau considered this a serious error that must be strictly corrected. In addition to individual talks with Liu Zhaolin by responsible comrades and convening a symposium of bureau cadres and staff to patiently educate Liu, the bureau also convened a "Oppose Kuomintang Work Style" conference on the 2nd of this month, inviting representatives from 24 agencies and organizations in the city, as well as Zhao Chunhe, a worker at the Da Zhonghua Bathhouse, and manager Tian Jinwen to participate. After reporting Liu Zhaolin's criminal behavior, the responsible comrade of the bureau emphasized the necessity of opposing and washing away the bad work styles left over from the Kuomintang and asked everyone to provide suggestions for handling and transforming Liu Zhaolin. Then, Zhao Chunhe and comrades from the Public Security Bureau introduced the circumstances of Liu's mistakes. At this time, the attendees shouted slogans such as "Oppose the Kuomintang's work style of arbitrarily beating and detaining people!" and "Revolutionary soldiers must firmly remember the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention!" Zhang Meisen, a representative of the Finance Bureau, said, "Liu Zhaolin's mistakes have their social causes. Those of us who have just joined revolutionary work from Kuomintang agencies have been infected with many bad habits from the old society. We should all reflect on past sins and wash them clean, otherwise, the people will not forgive us, and we will not be worthy of serving the people." The attendees unanimously demanded that Liu Zhaolin be dismissed from his post and asked him to thoroughly reflect on his mistakes. Finally, the bureau accepted everyone's opinions, gave Liu Zhaolin a dismissal punishment, and ordered him to repay the bath money.

　　郑州公安局留用职员刘兆林
  　恶习不改受到处分
    【新华社中原十八日电】郑州迟到消息：郑州市公安局整饬革命纪律，处分为非作歹的旧职员刘兆林。刘曾做过国民党郑州警备司令部的便衣侦探，一贯对群众敲诈勒索，看戏、洗澡从不给钱。郑州解放后，他到公安局登记，表示愿意悔过；并要求工作。郑州人民市政府公安局乃予以宽大自新之路，准他在局服务，希望他能戴罪立功。但刘恶习不改，上月二十四日在大中华澡塘洗澡，硬要欠帐。二十七日又去洗澡，则不认前帐，拒不给钱。澡塘工人赵春和向他索取，他叫赵跟他到公安局拿钱，想用“公安局”名义来威胁工人。而赵春和对人民政府很有认识，他说：“要是国民党在这里，我就不敢要了，现在是人民政府，我就不怕你。”刘恼羞成怒，最后竟把赵春和带往警察大队。澡塘经理田近文跟着赶来，向刘说了好话，才将赵带回。此事发生后，市公安局接郑市职工会筹备委员张治平来信，当即讯问刘兆林。刘不仅不承认错误，反诬赵春和破坏名誉，声称要到法院控告，要登报声明。局方认为此一严重错误，必须加以严格纠正。除由负责同志和刘兆林个别谈话，以及召集局内干部、职员开座谈会对刘耐心教育外，该局又于本月二日召开“反对国民党作风”大会，并邀请全市二十四个机关团体代表，及大中华澡塘工人赵春和、经理田近文参加。局方负责同志于报告刘兆林的犯罪行为后，强调说明反对与洗刷国民党遗留下来的恶劣作风的必要，并请大家提供处理及改造刘兆林的意见。接着赵春和及公安局同志，又介绍刘犯错误的经过。这时到会人员纷纷叫出了“反对随便打人扣人的国民党作风！”“革命军人要牢记三大纪律八项注意”等口号。财政局代表张梅森说：“刘兆林的错误，有其社会的原因。我们刚从国民党机关初参加革命工作的人，沾染了许多旧社会的坏习气，都应该反省过去罪恶，要把它洗刷干净，否则人民是不会原谅我们的，我们也不配为人民服务。”到会人员一致要求将刘兆林撤职，叫他彻底反省。最后，局方接受了大家的意见，予刘兆林以撤职处分，并令其还清洗澡钱。
