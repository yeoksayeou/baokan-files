Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 25th: Under MacArthur's dictatorial rule, Japan is economically becoming a colony of the United States and a tool for the U.S.'s expansionist policy in the Far East.

In the past year, two Japanese industries—steel and textiles—have shown abnormal development, and both of these industries are producing for American capital. Last year was a year of rapid increase in Japan's steel production. It is estimated that Japan's steel production for this fiscal year (from April 1st of last year to the end of March this year) will reach 1.1 million to 1.2 million tons, doubling the previous year. In order to continue expanding steel production, the Japanese government has announced the construction of eight more blast furnaces and the reopening of some steel mills that were to be dismantled as reparations, in order to achieve the goal of producing 1.8 million tons of steel and 1.7 million tons of pig iron in the next fiscal year. These steel products, in addition to being used for military purposes, will be shipped to the United States in large quantities. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Sawyer recently publicly announced that the U.S. will send a steel delegation to Japan to investigate Japanese "scrap steel" and will "recommend that scrap steel exceeding Japan's self-sufficiency be shipped to the United States."

In the textile industry, the United States is shipping its surplus cotton to Japan, using Japanese factories and cheap labor to manufacture dollars for itself. U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper publicly stated on January 12th: "Japan will become the largest buyer of U.S. cotton in order to restore its textile industry. Currently, Japan needs more than 60,000 bales (each bale weighing 227 kilograms) of U.S. cotton per month." With the active support of American merchants, Japan's cotton textile production for this fiscal year will reach 270 million pounds, and rayon textile production will reach 78 million pounds. These textiles are being shipped to various parts of the Far East in large quantities. Encouraged by MacArthur, Japan has successively signed trade agreements with India, Pakistan, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Malaya, Australia, the Netherlands, and other countries. In order to expand exports, the Japanese government has planned to double exports in the next fiscal year starting from April 1st this year. According to a January 15th Agence France-Presse dispatch, the U.S. occupation authorities have approved Japan to establish sixteen trade offices abroad, "allowing Japan to return to the international stage without waiting for the signing of a peace treaty."

American capital is now pouring into Japan. Japan has become a competitive arena for investment by U.S. monopoly capitalists. Major U.S. companies actively operating in Japan, including Mobil Oil, General Electric (which held 24% of the shares of Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company before the war and also held shares in Mitsubishi), Standard Electric (which held 50% of the shares of Nippon Electric Company and 12% of the shares of Sumitomo Electric Company before the war), Clipper Transportation, Renault, British American Tobacco, etc., have recently signed more than half a dozen investment agreements with major Japanese Zaibatsu companies. In addition, Ford Motor Company and New Empire Motor Company, Texaco and Nippon Oil Company, General Motors and Yanase Motor Company, Northwest Airlines and Tokyo Construction Industry, Nikkatsu Corporation, and Japan International Tourist Agency have all concluded U.S. investment agreements. Nippon Yusen has obtained $20 million in investment from U.S. shipping companies in the form of leasing "Liberty ships." Now, U.S. monopoly capital "has actually occupied all the major sectors of the Japanese economy and controls Japan's foreign trade" (TASS, January 20th).

In order to consolidate the rule of American capital over Japan, MacArthur is continuing to employ Japanese Zaibatsu companies that should be dissolved as agents of American capital. After MacArthur announced the "liberation" of 75 Zaibatsu companies on January 4th, he "liberated" 15 more Zaibatsu companies on the 14th. So far, more than 390 of the 1,200 Japanese Zaibatsu companies listed for elimination have been "restored to freedom." Other companies that have been designated for elimination are also gradually being crossed off the list.

The U.S. imperialist policy of turning Japan into its base of aggression has also made Japan's financial situation increasingly worse. In Japan's past national budget, about 40% was used to pay for occupation expenses. According to the Ministry of Finance's recently drafted budget for the next fiscal year, occupation expenses will still account for 135 billion yen out of 724 billion yen. MacArthur's recently decided five-year road construction plan for military purposes is estimated to require a total investment of 18 billion yen. Because the Japanese government is unable to balance its budget, it has adopted two ways to make up for it at the expense of the interests of the working people. The Japanese government first turned to its printing press. As of the end of last December, the amount of yen issued had reached 368 billion yen, while the amount issued at the end of 1945 was only 55 billion yen. The second is to increase already very heavy taxes. The Japanese working people bore 95% of the government's revenue in 1948, while the major Zaibatsu companies bore only 5%. According to the so-called plan to "restore" and "stabilize" the Japanese economy, which the U.S. State Department illegally and unilaterally announced in mid-December last year, the Japanese government decided to further increase various tax rates on January 13th, which will make the already struggling Japanese people bear an even heavier burden.

Under the joint exploitation of the U.S. and Japanese Zaibatsu, and under the blows of inflation, rampant black markets, heavy taxes, and forced grain requisitioning, the lives of the Japanese people, especially the workers and peasants, are unprecedentedly deteriorating. Japanese workers are suffering from the disaster of inflation. According to official Japanese statistics cited by TASS on January 20th, from February 1947 to August 1948, although workers' nominal wages increased by 17%, prices soared by 548%. Although the working class forced the government to increase the minimum monthly wage standard from 3,700 yen to 6,300 yen at the end of last year through continuous strikes throughout the year, it is still far from the minimum living requirement of 11,000 yen proposed by the workers in October last year. The U.S. government's recently announced nine-point "stabilization" plan for the Japanese economy is launching a new offensive against Japanese workers. Under the "rationalization" measures of this plan, the labor intensity of workers will be increased, working hours will be extended, and a large number of workers will be laid off and become unemployed. The Japanese Ministry of Labor admitted on January 10th that as a result of "administrative reforms" and "industrial reorganization," 1.2 million people will be unemployed in public and private enterprises, which will increase the number of unemployed in Japan to about 3 million. The lives of farmers are even more difficult. Even Labor, an agricultural expert at MacArthur's headquarters, cannot deny this. After inspecting rural areas in Hokkaido and Kyushu, Labor told reporters on January 10th that due to black markets, high taxes, and the forced requisitioning of huge amounts of grain at official prices, farmers in northern Japan have been forced to sell their children and rely on borrowing grain to survive. Labor then exclaimed, "Most rural areas in Japan are convinced that a recession is about to arrive," and "the American authorities are afraid that the farmers will riot." According to a recent survey by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the lives of students in many cities in Japan are also very difficult. In Tokyo alone, there are 5,000 college students who make a living by selling peanuts and newspapers.

The Japanese people are unwilling to be slaves to U.S. monopoly capital and its lackeys. The surge of the Japanese strike movement in the past year, especially the growth of the prestige of the Japanese Communist Party, is clear evidence. The Japanese working people are turning their hopeful eyes to the Japanese Communist Party, which is fighting for Japan's independence and democracy.

### 在麦克阿瑟独裁管制下日本正变为美帝殖民地

　　在麦克阿瑟独裁管制下日本正变为美帝殖民地
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】在麦克阿瑟的独裁管制下，日本在经济上正在变为美国的殖民地，变为美国在远东扩张政策的工具。
    过去一年中，日本有两种工业——钢铁业与纺织业，显得畸形的发展，而这两种工业都是替美国资本生产的。去年是日本钢产激增的一年。据估计，本会计年度（自去年四月一日至今年三月底）的日本钢产，将达一百十万吨至一百二十万吨，较上年度增加一倍。为了继续扩大钢铁产量，日本政府已宣布再建鼓风炉八个，并使一些应予拆除作为赔偿的制钢厂重行开工，以达到下年度产钢一百八十万吨，产铣铁一百七十万吨的目标。这些钢铁产品，除了用于军事目的之外，将被大量地运至美国。美商务部长沙逸最近公开宣布：美将派钢铁代表团赴日，调查日本“废钢”，并将“建议超出日本自给的废钢运往美国”。
    在纺织业方面，美国正将其过剩的棉花运往日本，利用日本的工厂与便宜的劳动力，为它制造美元。美陆次德莱伯一月十二日公开地说：“日本为恢复其纺织业，将成为美棉的最大买主。目前，日本每月需用美棉在六万包（每包合二百二十七公斤）以上。”在美国商人的积极扶植下，本会计年度的日本棉织品产量，将达二亿七千万磅，人造丝织品将达七千八百万磅。这些纺织品正被大量运销远东各地。在麦克阿瑟的鼓励下，日本已先后与印度、巴基斯坦、荷印、暹罗、马来亚、澳洲、荷兰等国订立了商约。为了扩大出口，日本政府已预定自今年四月一日起的下一年度，增加出口一倍。据法新社一月十五日电称：美国占领当局已批准日本在国外设立十六个贸易办事处，“不待签订和约便使日本重返国际舞台”。
    美国资本现正源源涌入日本。日本已变成美国独占资本家投资的角逐场。积极在日本活动的美国各大公司，包括美孚油公司、奇异电气公司（它战前即握有东京芝浦电力公司股票百分之二十四，同时握有三菱公司的股票）、标准电气公司（它战前握有日本电气公司股票百分之五十及住友电气公司股票百分十二）、克里佛运输公司、雷诺公司、英美烟草公司等，最近已与日本各大财阀公司订立了半打以上的投资协定。此外，福特汽车公司与新帝国汽车公司、德士古石油公司与日本石油公司、通用汽车公司与柳濑汽车公司、西北航空公司与东京建筑业、日活电影公司及日本国际旅行社等，均已缔结了美国投资的协定。日本邮船公司已以租借“自由轮”的形式，自美国航运公司获得了两千万美元的投资。现在，美国独占资本实际上“已占有日本经济的一切主要部门，并控制着日本的对外贸易”（塔斯社一月二十日电）。
    为了巩固美国资本对日本的统治，麦克阿瑟正继续起用应予解散的日本财阀公司，作为美国资本的代理人。麦克阿瑟于一月四日宣布“解放”七十五家财阀公司后，又于十四日“解放”十五家财阀公司。至此，列在清除名单上的一千二百家日本财阀公司中，已有三百九十余家“恢复自由”。其他给予清除的公司，亦有被逐步勾销的趋势。
    美帝国主义在军事上变日本为其侵略基地的政策，使得日本的财政形势，也日益恶化。日本过去的国家预算中，约有百分之四十系供给占领费。据大藏省最近拟定的明年度预算，占领费将仍占七千二百四十亿日元中的一千三百五十亿日元。麦克阿瑟最近为军事目的而决定进行的修筑公路五年计划，全部工程估计亦将需款一百八十亿日元。日本政府由于无法平衡预算，便采取了牺牲劳动人民利益的两种弥补办法。日本政府首先是乞助于它的印钞机器。截至去年十二月底为止，日元的发行额已达三千六百八十亿日元，而一九四五年底的发行额则仅为五百五十亿日元。第二是加重已经非常苛重的税收。日本劳动人民在一九四八年中负担了政府岁入的百分之九十五，而各大财阀公司仅负担百分之五。根据美国务院去年十二月中旬非法片面宣布的所谓“恢复”与“稳定”日本经济的计划，日政府已于一月十三日决定再提高各种税率，这将使已经喘不过气的日本人民，负担更为沉重。
    在美、日财阀的联合榨取下，在通货膨胀、黑市猖獗、捐税苛重、强迫征粮的打击下，日本人民，主要是工农大众的生活，是空前的恶化了。日本劳工正遭受通货膨胀的灾难。据塔斯社一月廿日电引日本官方的统计，自一九四七年二月至一九四八年八月，工人的名义工资虽然增加了百分之十七，但物价却狂涨了百分之五百四十八。工人阶级在去年一年不断的罢工中，虽然于去年年底迫使政府将工人的每月的最低工资标准自三千七百日元增至六千三百日元，但仍然和去年十月工人所提出的最低生活要求一万一千日元，相距很远。美政府最近公布的九点对日“稳定”经济计划，又向日本劳工进行新的进攻。在该计划的“合理化”措施下，工人的劳动强度将被提高，工时将被延长，大批工人将因此被解雇而告失业。日劳工省一月十日承认，由于“行政改革”及“工业改组”的结果，公私企业中将有一百二十万人失业，这将使日本的失业人数增至三百万人左右。农民的生活更是困苦。这点连麦克阿瑟总部的农业专家雷柏也不能不承认。雷柏在考察北海道、九州的农村后，于一月十日招待记者时称：由于黑市、高税及按官价强迫征收巨量粮食，日本北部的农民已被迫卖儿鬻女，依靠借粮度日。雷柏接着惊叫道：“日本大多数农村都确信萧条将立即到来”，“美国当局害怕农民将发生骚动”。另据日本教育部最近统计，日本许多城市的学生生活也很艰难，仅东京一地，即有大学生五千人以卖花生、报纸来维持他们的生活。
    日本人民是不甘心做美国独占资本及其走狗的奴隶的。过去一年中日本罢工运动的澎湃，尤其是日共威望的增长，便是明证。日本劳动人民正把他们希望的眼睛，转向于为日本独立民主而斗争的日本共产党。
