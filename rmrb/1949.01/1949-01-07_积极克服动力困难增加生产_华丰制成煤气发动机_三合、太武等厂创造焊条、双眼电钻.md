【Taihang News】Huafeng Iron Factory, under the Taihang Industrial Company, successfully trial-produced a British-made 15-horsepower gas engine. This machine has simple equipment and saves fuel, making a great contribution to the development of small-scale light industry in the liberated areas. In order to solve the power difficulties in Taihang's industrial construction, the factory sent technicians Comrades Liang Guozhen and Li Xinru to the Taiyue District Tool Manufacturing Factory in March of last year to draw blueprints of a British-made 15-horsepower gas engine (moved back from Qinyang). After returning to the factory with the blueprints, all the staff carefully studied the manufacturing method of the machine and created many machines for manufacturing it during the research process. After eight months of hard work, and with the enthusiastic help of Comrade Du Haide, a gas engine worker from Taiyue District, they finally completed this trial production task, installed it in November, and the test results showed good quality. It has now been officially put into use. The advantages of this machine are its simple equipment and low fuel consumption. Each horsepower requires about one catty of anthracite coal per hour, which is much cheaper than using steam power. It is currently being continuously improved. (Li Yinpeng)
    【Yangquan News】Wang Jin, an electric welder at the Sanhe Factory, painstakingly studied and came up with a method for making welding rods. Welding rods are a very important tool for repairing boilers, iron pipes, etc., and many industrial departments cannot do without them. In the past, we bought them from outside. Not only are they expensive now, but we can't even buy them. In order to solve this difficulty, Comrade Wang Jin decided to find a way to make them himself. He consulted with other workers and studied hard on his own, matching some materials and experimenting several times. As a result, he created welding rods. In addition to buying borax and stinky gum as raw materials, the other materials are several local ores. Not only is the cost much lower than buying from outside, but they are also easier to use than welding rods from outside.

    【Changzhi News】Under the design of Chen Shangzhi, deputy director of the Taiwu Factory, and Li Chengbao, Zheng Guangjing also participated in making a machine in October that drills two eyes at once. The appearance is roughly similar to a large rocking drill and is called a variable-eye electric drill. This drill is used to drill eyes on wooden boards and is a special tool. In the past, workers drilled eyes by hand, completing 400 per day (10 hours). With this tool, they can complete 3,000 eyes per day (10 hours), increasing production efficiency by 7.5 times. This is still using manual power, not electricity.
    【Another News】The staff of the Taiwu Factory launched a learning movement under the new situation. On December 1st, Supervisor Cheng Youcheng called on the general staff meeting: "The situation is developing very quickly, and the thinking of the staff comrades is still behind the needs of the situation. We must work hard to study and improve ourselves." On the 3rd, five members of the leading learning committee were selected. After a general discussion, the learning content and plan were determined. The content mainly included "The Current Tasks of Chinese Workers," "The Organizational Charter of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions," and cultural arithmetic. They were divided into three classes according to their level and studied separately. It was generally set as follows: After learning the tasks or charter on Tuesday, small groups discussed on Friday, and classes studied culture and arithmetic on Friday. (Xiang Ze)

### 积极克服动力困难增加生产　华丰制成煤气发动机  三合、太武等厂创造焊条、双眼电钻

　　积极克服动力困难增加生产
  　华丰制成煤气发动机
    三合、太武等厂创造焊条、双眼电钻
    【太行讯】太行实业公司所属华丰铁工厂试制英造十五匹马力煤气发动机成功。该机设备简便，节省燃料，对发展解放区小型轻工业贡献颇大。该厂为解决太行工业建设上动力的困难，即于去年三月派技术人员梁国珍、李心如二同志前往太岳区工具制造厂绘制英制十五匹马力煤气发动机（由沁阳搬回）图样，脱样回厂后，全体职工即精心研究该机制法，在研究过程中，又创造了许多制造该机的机器，他们经过八个月的努力，和太岳区煤气机工人都海德同志的热情帮助，终于完成了这一试制任务，于十一月份安装完毕，经试验结果质量尚好，现已正式开动使用。这种机器的优点是设备简便，需用燃料较少，每小时每匹马力大约用一市斤无烟煤即可。比用蒸气动力便宜的多。现正继续改进提高中。（李荫蓬）
    【阳泉讯】三合工厂电焊匠王金同志，苦心钻研，想出了自造焊条的办法。焊条是修补锅炉铁管等的一种顶重要的工具，好多工业部门都少不了它。过去咱们都是向外面买。眼下不但价钱贵，还买不着。为了解决这个困难，王金同志决心自己想法造。他一面同别的工友商量，一面自己苦心研究，把一些材料配搭着，作了好几次试验，结果造成了焊条。除买了些硼砂和臭胶两宗药料外，其他的材料就是本地的几种矿石。不但成本比外面低得很多，而且比外面的焊条好使唤。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（工人周万明、杨招义）
    【长治讯】太武工厂副厂长陈尚智和李成保二人设计下，郑光景也参加做，在十月份创造出一个一下钻两个眼的机器，样子大致和一个大摇轮钻差不多，叫个变眼电钻。此钻是叫钻木板上的眼的，是一个专门工具。过去工人用手工钻眼，一日（十小时）完成四百个，用这个东西一日（十小时）能完成三千个眼。提高生产效率七倍半。这还是用人力摇，还不是用电力。
    【又讯】太武工厂职工在新的形势下，开展了学习运动。十二月一日监委程有成同志，在全体职工大会上号召说：“形势发展的很快，职工同志们的思想还落在形势需要之后了，必须努力学习，提高自己才行。”于三日选出领导学习的委员五人，经过全体讨论之后，订出学习内容与计划。内容主要是“中国职工的当前任务”“中华职工总会的组织章程”，及文化算术。按程度分为三个班，分别进行学习。一般定为：礼拜二学了任务或章程之后，礼拜五小组讨论，礼拜五分班学文化与算术。（祥则）
