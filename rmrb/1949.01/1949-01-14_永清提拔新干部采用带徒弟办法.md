　　[Jizhong Telegram] To adapt to the development of the situation and the needs of the work, the Yongqing County Party Committee has focused on promoting new cadres since October. The county has a relatively weak foundation for its work. About two-thirds of the cadres in the county are transferred from old and semi-old areas, and there are very few local cadres. Recently, the working area has expanded, and the lack of cadres has become more acute. Therefore, promoting cadres has become an urgent task. At the county and district cadres' meeting on October 14th, the County Party Committee clearly stated that it is necessary to change the old views of the past and boldly promote. If the ability is not enough at the beginning, it can be improved in the work. Thanks to the efforts of the whole party, 21 new cadres have been promoted so far. The promotion method is: generally adopting the "apprentice" system. For example, Comrade Ma Xinghua of the Fourth District Armed Forces Department selected good militia members and village cadres to work with the district, gradually cultivated them, and finally promoted them to work. Another method is to send some promising village cadres to cadre training classes held by the Prefectural Committee or the County to study for a period of time, and then promote them to work. Still another is to cultivate and promote older security and transportation personnel in the organs. Recently, four people were promoted from the post office. Due to long-term work experience, they have a good political understanding, but they lack practical work experience. They have been trained at work for a period of time and generally perform very well.
    However, these newly promoted cadres still have many concerns in their minds, such as fear of being transferred far away, fear of no one at home to do the work, low political and cultural level, lack of working methods, and not daring to be boldly responsible. It is necessary to strengthen education in a timely manner to raise their awareness, help them solve specific difficulties in their work at any time, and try to solve their family or life difficulties, so that they can work with peace of mind.

### 永清提拔新干部采用带徒弟办法

　　永清提拔新干部采用带徒弟办法
    【冀中电】适应形势的发展与工作的需要，永清县委从十月以来就重视了提拔新干部。该县工作基础较差，全县干部中，从老区、半老区调来的约占三分之二，本地干部很少。近来工作地区扩大，干部更感缺乏，因而提拔干部成为刻不容缓的急务。十月十四日县区干部会上，县委明确提出必须改变过去的旧观点，大胆提拔。开始能力不够，可以在工作中去提高。由于全党的努力，到现在已提拔出新干部二十一人。提拔的方法是：一般的采用带徒弟办法，如四区武装部马兴化同志，就是选拔好的民兵和村干部随区一块工作，逐渐培养，最后提拔出来工作。另外是将一些有培养前途的村干部，送到地委或县召开的干部训练班中学习一个时期，然后提拔出来工作。再就是培养提拔机关中较老的警卫交通人员。最近邮局中提出来四个人，他们由于长期工作锻炼，政治认识较好，但缺乏实际工作经验，在工作中锻炼了一个时期，一般表现很好。
    但这样提拔出来的新干部，在思想上还有不少顾虑，如怕远调、怕家里没人做活以及政治文化水平低，工作办法少，不敢大胆负责等。必须及时加强教育，提高他们的觉悟，随时帮助解决工作中的具体困难，对他们的家庭或生活上的困难，也必须设法解决，使能安心工作。
