(Jidong Electric) With the complete liberation of eastern Hebei, the masses in various places rejoiced and enthusiastically supported the front lines. In the 13th and 14th districts, and Qian'an, Qianxi, Lulong, Zunhua, and Yutian counties alone, more than 30,000 stretchers have been organized into stretcher teams, and inspections and exercises have been conducted to prepare for departure at any time. According to incomplete statistics, 33 stretcher regiments (approximately 10,000 stretchers) have been successively sent to the front lines. The masses in Xinglong Township were about to collect firewood when they received a notice to depart with the stretchers. They rushed back from various places to gather within three hours and set off to the front lines. Huang Wancai, a Party member and cadre in the town, returned home from the mountains covered in sweat and said, "If I had known we were going to depart today, who would have gone to collect firewood?" Many young and middle-aged women in the villages also organized rear stretcher teams. For example, 87 stretchers were spontaneously organized in 14 villages in the first district of Ninghe. In terms of transportation, in addition to the main and branch roads and bridges of all sizes in eastern Hebei being repaired, the 13th district and Yutian County alone organized a transportation team with more than 8,100 large carts. In December, the 13th district dispatched more than 20,000 carts in three batches, and the task of transporting more than 17.7 million catties of military grain was fully completed. The 14th district also completed the task of transporting more than 3 million catties of military grain. Baodi County transported 3.2 million catties of military grain and 200,000 catties of military grass in nine days. In order to guarantee the urgent needs of the People's Liberation Army, more than 200 large and small vehicles transported 300,000 catties of military grain to the troop garrison 90 miles away in just one day and night. In the mountainous disaster area of ​​Qinglong, where transportation capacity was limited, the masses used donkeys to carry goods, and people carried loads on poles and backs. For example, Xishuangshan Village in the 6th district transported 7,000 catties of military grain to the designated location 17 miles away in one day.

　　冀东全境解放群众热烈支前
    【冀东电】冀东全境解放，各地群众欢腾鼓舞，热烈支援前线。仅十三、十四分区及迁安、迁西、卢龙、遵化、玉田五县，已组成三万余付的大担架队，并进行检阅演习，随时准备出征。现据不完全的统计，各地已有卅三个担架团（约担架万付），先后开赴前线。兴隆镇区群众正要打柴去，忽接担架出征的通知，三个钟头内即由各处赶回集合，开赴前线。该镇党员干部黄万才累的满头大汗由山上赶回家里说：“早知今天出征，谁还去打柴呢？”很多村庄青壮年妇女也组织了后方担架、宁河一区十四个村就自动组织八十七付。在运输方面，除冀东全境内纵横交叉的支干公路及大小桥梁已抢修完竣外，仅十三分区及玉田一县，即组织了拥有八千一百余辆大车的运输队，在十二月份，十三分区前后三批出动大车两万余辆，一千七百余万斤军粮的运输任务已全部完成。十四分区亦完成赶运军粮三百余万斤的任务。宝抵一县九天内即赶运军粮三百二十万斤及军草二十万斤。为保证解放军急需，二百余辆大小车、将三十万斤军粮一昼夜即全部运到相距九十里的部队驻地。青龙山地灾区运输力小，群众纷纷用驴驮、人力挑担、背运。如六区西双山村一天即赶运七千斤军粮，到相距十七里的指定地点。
