    Someone in Dakangzhuang is Destroying the Zhanghe River Dike
    Please Send People from the Weixian Leadership to Investigate
    Comrades Editors of the People's Daily:
    Fifteen *li* southwest of Daming County city is an old course of the Zhanghe River. This river is north of Dakangzhuang Village and south of Yangweicheng Village. During the Qing Dynasty, two river dikes were built (one on the north and one on the south bank) to prevent flooding.

    Since these two river dikes were built, the dike on the north bank has received more attention and repair from the government at the time because Daming City was on the north bank, so the dike body is relatively intact. However, the river dike on the south bank has been in disrepair for many years and has almost become flat ground.

    Dakangzhuang used to belong to Daming County. It was only after our democratic government was established in 1940 that it was assigned to the Fourth District of Zhanghe County. One year before the Japanese surrender, Zhang (he) and Wei (xian) counties were merged, and it became the Fourth District of Weixian County.

    Yangweicheng was also assigned to the Second District of Zhanghe in 1940. After the merger of Zhang and Wei counties, it was assigned to the Seventh District of Weixian County. After the Japanese surrender, it was assigned to the Third District of Daming County.

    The villages of Dakangzhuang and Yangweicheng have had many lawsuits and fights in history because Dakangzhuang dug up the dike and Yangweicheng repaired the dike. In August 1937, when the Zhanghe River flooded, Dakangzhuang dug open the river dike, causing the Zhanghe River to breach its banks and flood 108 villages east and northeast of Yangweicheng, destroying about 1,500 to 1,600 *qing* of fields and seedlings (approximate). At that time, because the Kuomintang government was busy fleeing and the people were also panicked, no riots broke out. In 1943, Dakangzhuang again dug up the dike under armed cover, and the villagers of Yangweicheng reported it to the Zhanghe Fourth District Office. The district chief at the time, Lian Dexiu, told the masses who reported the situation from Yangweicheng: "Your place is an enemy area, it doesn't matter if it's flooded! I don't care!" So, the villagers of Yangweicheng returned disappointed. In 1945, Dakangzhuang dug open the river dike again, and our Fourth District government did not care (at this time, Daming City had been liberated). The district chief at the time was Zhang Changjiang. There were no floods in 1946 and 1947. This year, in 1948, when the Zhanghe River flooded, the villagers of Yangweicheng went to repair the dike, but were dispersed by the militia of Dakangzhuang Village with guns. Later, Kong Kong, the Minister of Organization of the Weixian County Party Committee, personally watched the militia of Dakangzhuang digging up the dike and did not care.

    Later, the villagers of Yangweicheng reported to the Daming County government, which sent the county brigade to suppress and supervise the dike repair. As a result, Dakangzhuang gathered more than a dozen armed militiamen to dig up the dike, causing 108 villages downstream of Yangweicheng to suffer from floods again, and most of the fields and seedlings were destroyed. Afterwards, they only told Dakangzhuang to repair the dike. "The seedlings have already been destroyed, what's the use of repairing the dike!" This is the complaint of the old people on the north bank of the dike!

    I request: The Weixian County Committee should seriously investigate who the mastermind behind the digging of the dike in Dakangzhuang is, what the reason is, and quickly resolve it.

    The above situation is inevitably subject to some minor discrepancies, because I did not have time to investigate, but there are no major discrepancies.

　　大康庄有人破坏漳河堤
  　请魏县领导上派人检查
    人民日报社编辑同志：
    大名县城西南十五里有一道漳河故道，这条河在大康庄村北，杨未城村南。满清年间曾修了两道河堤（河南北两岸各有一道）以防水灾。
    自从这两道河堤修起后，河北岸的堤，因大名城在北岸，当时的官府还比较关心，注意修理，所以堤身比较完整。而南岸河堤则年久失修，已几乎成了平地。
    大康庄过去也是大名县属，自从一九四零年咱们民主政府建立后，才划归漳河县四区。日本投降前一年，漳（河）魏（县）两县合并，又成了魏县四区。
    杨未城自一九四零年也划归漳河二区，漳、魏两县合并后划为魏县七区。日本投降后又划归大名县三区。
    大康庄与杨未城这两个村子，因为大康庄挖堤，杨未城修堤，历史上打过不少的官司；也打过不少架。在一九三七年八月漳河水发时，大康庄反挖开河堤，使漳河决口，淹坏杨未城以东及东北一百零八个村子，淹坏田苗一千五、六百顷（约数）。当时因国民党政府正忙于逃跑，人民也是慌慌不安，故没有起了祸乱。一九四三年大康庄又以武装掩护挖堤，而被杨未城村民告发到漳河四区区公所，当时区长是连德修，对杨未城告状的群众说：“你们那里是敌区，淹了没关系！不管！”就这样，杨未城的村民就败兴的回来了。一九四五年大康庄又挖开了河堤，咱们的四区区政府又没有管（这时大名城已解放了）。当时的区长是张长江。一九四六，一九四七年没有发水，今年一九四八年漳河水发时，杨未城村民去修堤，而被大康庄村的民兵用枪打散，后来魏县县委组织部长孔空亲眼看着大康庄的民兵挖堤，也不管。
    后来杨未城村民告到大名县府，县府派县大队镇压，监视修堤，结果大康庄竟召集十几村民兵武装挖堤，致使杨未城下游百零八村又受洪水之灾，田苗大部被淹坏。而事后仅是叫大康庄修了修堤了事。“苗子已淹坏了，再修堤有何用！”这是堤北岸老百姓的怨声！
    我要求：魏县县委会应认真的调查大康庄挖堤的主谋人究竟是谁？原因是什么，迅速加以解决。
    以上这些情况免不了有些小出入，因为我没有时间作调查，但大的出入是没有的。
