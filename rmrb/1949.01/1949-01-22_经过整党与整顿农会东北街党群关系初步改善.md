　　【Jilu Yu Power Transmission】In Fan County, after the Northeast Street branch carried out preliminary party consolidation and led the masses in production, it rectified the mass organizations and strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. The village's situation was very chaotic at the beginning. The relationship between the Party and the masses, as well as within the branch, was abnormal. The masses were dissatisfied with the past bad practices of Party members and cadres, such as beating and scolding people, indulging in eating and drinking, and arbitrarily labeling people as special agents. After the work team entered the village, approaching Party members made the masses afraid; approaching the masses made Party members afraid. Based on this situation, the work team first led the branch to carry out preliminary party consolidation work, resolving the main contradictions among the branch committee members. Then, all Party members conducted self-reflection and mutual criticism, examining issues such as corruption and commandism. After the initial party consolidation, the work team proceeded to lead the end of the land reform and the reorganization of the farmers' association. They first resolved some scattered problems among the farmers. For example, when Li Yunjiang's pig ate crops and was beaten to death, the farmers' association mediated and provided compensation. They also settled accounts for the corruption in the oil mill. This was followed by class division, land adjustment, reorganization of labor conscription, and house adjustment. Although these tasks were based on preliminary plans discussed and formulated by the branch, they were also discussed at the cadres' meeting of the farmers' association and then through group discussions, so that the masses could fully express their opinions and revise the branch's plan before being implemented under the leadership of the cadres. Therefore, afterwards, the masses believed that the cadres and Party members could listen to them, and the Party members and cadres also believed that the masses were easy to lead. Everyone had confidence in the work. In addition, in the process of carrying out these tasks, the different demands of workers, farmers, and merchants were resolved, and the mass organizations were reorganized. First, based on the results of negotiations between the oil mill workers and the shopkeepers, the oil mill workers' wages were appropriately revised to payment in kind and stipulated that they would be given three days off during the busy farming season. In addition, based on the opinions of both sides that workers should not always borrow food and shopkeepers should not delay wages, it was decided to settle accounts every 30 days. In this way, both labor and capital were satisfied, and two groups of trade unions were immediately established. Secondly, a merchant group was established, and the issue of labor conscription was resolved through consultation with the farmers' association. Thirdly, in the distribution of agricultural tools, everyone freely formed agricultural mutual aid groups. Seven groups, each with three to six households, have now been organized. As a result of these efforts, the masses' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. Four oil mills have bought ten livestock; other handicrafts and businesses have also been restored and developed; in the past, mass organizations could not afford to hold meetings, but now the meetings of various organizations have content; the relationship between the Party and the masses has improved, and the Party's prestige has gradually increased. In the past, although the masses knew who the Party members were, they were afraid of them and dared not approach them. Now, eight people, including poor farmer Han Jichang and Niu Mengcai, who had been a hired laborer for more than ten years, have taken the initiative to apply for Party membership. The branch has now decided to prepare for individual absorption.

　　经过整党与整顿农会东北街党群关系初步改善
    【冀鲁豫电】范县东北街支部，经过初步整党与领导群众生产，整顿了群众队伍，密切了党与群众的关系。该村开始时情况是很混乱的，党群之间以及支部内部的关系均不正常，群众对党员干部过去打骂人、吃吃喝喝、乱戴特务帽子等坏作风不满意。工作组进村后，接近党员，群众就害怕；接近群众，党员又害怕。根据这种情况，工作组首先领导支部进行了初步整党工作，解决了支委中的主要矛盾后，全体党员接着进行了自我反省与互相批评，检查了贪污腐化与强迫命令等问题。党内初步整顿后，接着就进行领导结束土改与整理农会。首先解决了农民中的几个零星问题。如李云江的猪啃了庄稼被打死了，农会调解加以赔偿，又清算了油坊的贪污，接着进行了划阶级、调剂土地、整理支差、调剂房子等工作。这些工作中，虽是经过支部讨论订出初步计划的；然而都又在农会干部会上讨论过，并经小组讨论，以达到让群众充分发表意见，修改了支部计划，然后才交干部领导进行的。所以事后群众都认为干部党员能听咱的话，党员干部也认为群众好领导，大家对工作都有了信心。另外在进行这些工作中又解决了工、农、商各种群众不同的要求；整顿了群众队伍。首先根据油坊工人和掌柜的双方协商的结果，适当地把油坊工人的工资改订为实物工资，并规定在农忙时放工三天；又根据工人不能老借粮，但掌柜也不能拖延工资的双方意见，作了卅天结算一次帐目的决定。这样劳资两利双方都满意，并随即建立了工会的两个组。其次成立了商人组，与农会协商解决了支差问题。第三在分农具中，大家自由结合成立农业互助组，现已组织了七个组，每组三户至六户。经过了这些工作，所以群众的生产情绪普遍提高，四个油坊已买到十个牲口；别的手工业和商业也有恢复与发展；群众组织过去开不起会来，现在各种组织的会议都有了内容；党群关系得到改善，党的威信也渐渐提高。过去群众虽知道谁是党员，但是怕他们不敢接近，现在贫农韩继昌和当过十多年雇工的牛孟才等八人，都主动地申请入党，支部现已决定准备个别吸收。
