　　I'd Also Like to Chime In
    ——My Views on the "Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil" Debate
    Qiao Yuzhou
    First, I believe that from an educational standpoint, "Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil" has achieved its deserved effect. Because it originated from the masses of peasants and returned to them, it is a processed version of the peasants' own experiences. It vividly portrays the collective image of the peasant masses. Anyone in the countryside can easily find their own reflection in it and be educated by it. For Party members, it can make them realize how harmful their poor work style and policy implementation are to the Party, the people, and themselves. For peasants, they can learn from it that only the Communist Party keeps its word, that the Party's policies are correct, and that the Party genuinely serves the people, thereby changing their wait-and-see attitude and joining the fiery struggle led by the Party. For women, it can make them understand that only the Communist Party can liberate them, and only the Communist Party can liberate all oppressed people! This is the great significance of this work, which "Strange Tales Old and New" simply cannot compare to.
    However, I also believe that this work has shortcomings. First, I agree with Comrade Dang Ziqiang's view of the feudal landlord in this novel. The feudal landlord in the book doesn't evoke strong hatred in us because he seems too docile and therefore not realistic enough. Second, in addition to agreeing with Comrade Dang's view on Xiao Bao, I also feel that there are even more flaws in Xiao Bao. That is, the relationship between Xiao Bao and Ruan Ying is not passionate enough. We know that Xiao Bao and Ruan Ying have been in love for several years. Ruan Ying's "little thoughts have long been on Xiao Bao," and of course, Xiao Bao is no exception. However, when the Liu family is about to snatch away the person he has admired for years, and he himself is carrying a food box to deliver gifts, logically, on the way to Ruan Ying's house, Xiao Bao should have some concern for Ruan Ying, to say the least. Xiao Bao stayed at Ruan Ying's house for a long time without thinking about Ruan Ying until he ran into Ruan Ying while looking for Xiao Dan, and he still "turned his head… and walked out." Fortunately, Ruan Ying called him back. Later, he returned to Ruan Ying's room, but when he got there, he "asked Ruan Ying what she was saying," and when Ruan Ying was counting the days on her fingers, he asked, "What are you doing in twenty-seven days?" Finally, when Ruan Ying told him, "Don't you know? September 13th!" Xiao Bao "suddenly remembered that the Liu family decided to marry her on September 13th." This is unreasonable. Third, I also feel that Ruan Ying's use of petty tricks needs to be discussed because it might lead some people to learn to use tricks when encountering difficulties. In this regard, as an author, one should consider the possible negative effects.

　　我也来插句嘴
    ——关于“邪不压正”争论的我见
    乔雨舟
    首先我认为从“邪不压正”教育意义上讲，是收到了它应得的效果的。因为，它是从农民群众中来而又到他们中去的，经过加工了的农民群众自己的东西。它生动的画出了农民大众的群像，每个在农村的人民，只要他看了它不难从里边找出他们自己的影子，并从而得到了教育。对党员，它能使他认识到自己的作风不良和执行政策上的错误，对党、对人民、对自己是有多么大的危害，对农民，从它里边他们可以认识到：只有共产党才是说一不二的，党的政策是没有错的，党是真心为人民服务的，并从而使他们改变观望的态度而参加到火热的党所领导的斗争里来；对妇女，它可以使她们了解：只有共产党才能解放她们，也只有共产党，才能解放一切被压迫的人们！这就是这篇作品的伟大意义，而“今古奇观”则根本不能与之比拟。
    但同时我认为这篇作品也是有缺点的；第一，我同意党自强同志对这篇小说中的封建地主的看法；书上的封建地主不能够引起我们强烈的憎恨，因为他看起来是很伏贴了，所以不够现实。第二，我除了同意党同志对小宝的看法外，还觉得在小宝身上还有更缺陷的地方。那就是表现在小宝和软英的关系上不够热切，我们知道：小宝和软英是几年的相爱了；软英的“小心事早就在小宝身上”，当然，小宝也不会例外。可是，当刘家马上就要夺去他几年来所崇爱的人，他自己又是抬着食盒去送礼的时候，照理，在往软英家去的路上，小宝就应该对软英有所关怀，这且不说。小宝到了软英家了半天，还没有想到软英，而直到吃了饭，小宝去找小旦的时候碰上了软英却还“扭转头……往外走”，幸亏软英唤住了他。到后来他才又回到软英房里，可是到了软英房便又“问软英说什么”，而当软英在用指数起日子来的时候，还问“二十七天做什么？”等到最后，软英告诉他：“你不知道？九月十三！”小宝才“猛然想起来刘家决定在九月十三娶她”。这是不合情理的。第三，我也觉得软英耍小手段的事有商榷的必要，因为它会不会使一些人们由此学来遇难事也来耍套手腕呢？在这方面，作为一个作者，是应该顾及到可能引起的反效果的。
