Shijiazhuang City Limin Electric Mill and Other Private Merchants
　　Warned for Hoarding and Profiteering
　　Municipal Government Orders Timely Supply of Hoarded Grain to the Market

[Report from this newspaper] In Shijiazhuang City, prices of various goods were steadily rising before the end of November last year. In early December, they surged once, but after the government's strong intervention, they have fallen this month. During the period of rising prices, in order to regulate grain prices, the Trade Corporation sold 460,000 jin of grain from December 2nd to 8th last year. In the ten days from December 24th to January 3rd, it sold another 1,000,000 jin of grain, providing a guarantee of life for workers, staff, and poor citizens. However, some private merchants, disregarding the impact on the lives of citizens and the legitimate interests of industry and commerce, took the opportunity to hoard and profiteer, engaging in speculation, which caused grain prices to fluctuate even more, and the market supply of grain could not meet demand. Some unscrupulous merchants who promoted the skyrocketing of grain prices have been investigated and dealt with by the government. Recently, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, conducted a random inspection of 32 industrial and commercial households and found more than 200,000 jin of grain and 83 bags of flour (this part of the grain, under normal circumstances, could supply the entire city for two days). For example, the private merchant Limin Electric Mill hoarded 45,000 jin of wheat; Xie Xing Grain Store and Qingcheng Cake Shop jointly hoarded more than 11,400 jin of wheat and more than 13,900 jin of miscellaneous grains. Grain merchant Zhao Gouzi hoarded more than 9,200 jin. Small merchants Di Chengjie, Hu Wenxi, Ding Baolan, and others hoarded 2,500 jin of millet and 3,200 jin of miscellaneous grains. Commercial Bank hoarded 1,500 jin of millet, 3,000 jin of wheat, 57 bags of flour, and another 1,500 jin. Individual public grain agencies also hoarded grain. To this end, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce specially convened illegal merchants on the afternoon of the 3rd to explain that the policy of protecting industry and commerce is to protect industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and hoarding and speculation must be strictly prohibited. For these illegal merchants this time, such as the Commercial Bank violating the operating regulations of the banking industry and hoarding grain, since it was the first time, they were all treated leniently. In addition to giving the above households a serious warning, they were also ordered to supply the hoarded grain to the market in a timely manner. Wanshengyong Electric Mill, which had long since changed its business to cotton ginning, falsely used the name of electric mill to hoard 6,000 jin of wheat and 5,000 jin of miscellaneous grains, and was fined 9,000 yuan in People's Currency.

At present, the various state-owned economic enterprises in Shijiazhuang City, under the leadership of the Municipal Government, are taking effective measures to vigorously stabilize prices and establish supply and marketing cooperatives to ensure that workers, staff, citizens, etc., are not affected or are less affected by price fluctuations.

　　石市利民电磨等私商
  　囤积居奇受到警告
　　市府责令将囤积粮食及时供应市场
    【本报讯】石家庄市，在去年十一月底以前，各种物价平稳上升，到十二月初，曾经一度高涨，经过政府大力平抑，本月初已经降落。在物价上升时期，为了调剂粮价，贸易公司曾经在去年十二月二号至八号抛售粮食四十六万斤。上月二十四至元月三号十天中，又抛售粮食达一百万斤。使工人、职员、贫苦市民获得了生活的保证。但是，有些私商却不顾影响市民生活，及正当工商业的利益，趁机囤积居奇，投机倒把，致使粮价更加波动，市场粮食供不应求。现促使粮价暴涨的奸商，部分已经政府查获，并分别给以处分。日前工商局协同公安局对三十二户工商户进行抽查，发现囤积粮食二十多万斤，面粉八十三袋（这部分粮食在正常情况下，可供全市两天消费）。如私商利民电磨囤积小麦四万五千斤，协兴粮店、庆成饼店合伙囤小麦一万一千四百余斤，杂粮一万三千九百余斤。粮商赵狗子囤九千二百余斤。小商底呈杰、胡文喜、丁保兰等八人囤小米两千五百斤，杂营三千二百斤。商业银号囤小米一千五百斤，小麦三千斤，面粉五十七袋，又一千五百斤。个别公粮机关也有囤积粮食的。为此，工商局特于三日下午召集违法商户，说明保护工商业政策是保护有利于国计民生的工商业，而对囤积居奇必须严加禁止。对这次这些违法商户，如商业银号违背银钱业经营规章，囤积粮食，因系第一次，一律从轻处理。以上各户除予严重警告外，并限将囤积粮食及时供应市场。底呈杰、赵狗子等漏税散商补缴工商税。万盛永电磨房，早已改业弹花，却假借电磨名义囤积小麦六千斤，杂粮五千斤，处以人民券九千元的罚款处分。
    目前石市各公营经济企业部门，在市政府领导下，进行有效措施，大力平抑物价，和建立供销合作社，保证工人、职员、市民等的供给，不受或少受物价波动的影响。　　　　　　　　　　　（柏青）
