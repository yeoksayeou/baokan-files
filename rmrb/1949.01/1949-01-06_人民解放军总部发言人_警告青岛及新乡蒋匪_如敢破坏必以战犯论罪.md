Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. The spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Headquarters stated: According to reliable information, the Kuomintang bandit troops remaining in Qingdao and Xinxiang are preparing to carry out large-scale sabotage during their retreat. On the 17th of last month, the Qingdao bandit troops transported 20,000 kilograms of explosives from Shanghai and installed them on the south coast, preparing to use them for destruction during their retreat. The 40th Division of the Xinxiang bandits recently buried hundreds of kilograms of explosives in the machinery rooms of the electric company and flour mill, attempting to destroy all the machinery when they flee. The PLA hereby issues a serious warning to the principal officers of the Kuomintang army in both locations, demanding that they abandon this sabotage plan. If they dare to execute this sabotage plan, the PLA will definitely prosecute the principal officers of the Kuomintang army in both locations as war criminals and will not show any leniency.

Taihang Telegram: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops besieged in the two isolated cities of Xinxiang and Anyang in northern Henan have been repeatedly thwarted by our local armed militia when they venture out of the city to loot grain and conscript men. A total of more than 170 enemy soldiers have been annihilated. On the 2nd of last month, Liu Le's bandit unit of more than 1,000 men from Anyang City invaded our 5th and 8th districts of Anyang County. Our local militia, in coordination with local armed forces, gave the bandits a head-on blow, killing and wounding more than 40 enemy soldiers, and the bandits fled back in panic. On the 4th, the bandits regrouped 200 more men to invade the 5th and 8th districts of the county, but were repelled by our local militia joint defense team. On the 11th, one battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the Xinxiang enemy and more than 500 men of the security regiments of the enemy Jun (County) and Qi (County) went to Wang Guitun and other places west of Jixian County to loot grain. Our local troops gave them a fierce blow, killing and wounding more than 20 enemy soldiers. After the remaining enemy fled back in disarray, they regrouped the remaining enemy from the city, including three companies of artillery and engineering directly under the 40th Army, and the entire 115th and 337th Regiments (note: the 115th Regiment was annihilated by our army once in the Xiaowu battle, this time it was pieced together with remnants) and the 12th Regiment of the Ji Security Corps (also annihilated by our army in Xunfeng, Xiuwu), invading the triangular area of Xinxiang, Hui (County) and Ji (County), looting grain and conscripting men on a large scale. Our Hui County Independent Regiment rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, and most of the enemy discovered and fled for their lives, leaving only the 6th Company of the 115th Regiment unable to escape. At noon that day, it was largely annihilated by our army. More than 40 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than 10 prisoners were captured, including platoon leaders and below. One cannon, one grenade launcher, one light and heavy machine gun each, dozens of long and short guns, some ammunition, ten carts, and some grain were seized. In addition, our local armed forces in Anyang annihilated no less than dozens of scattered small groups of invading enemies. In total, more than ten battles, large and small, annihilated more than 170 enemy soldiers. For this reason, the Anyang County Command issued a circular praising the militia and working teams of the 5th, 8th, and 9th districts of the county, as well as Huang Jincai and Zhai Donggui, the chiefs of the Checun joint defense team, and the Qiukou explosives team, and awarded them 550 rounds of ammunition and 15 landmines to encourage them to meet new victories.
