Suggestion to North China Transportation Company:
　　Ticket Sales Should Have a Limit; Drivers Should Be Responsible
Editor:
　　The North China Transportation Company (i.e., the motor vehicle company) is a public enterprise, but in many places, it is not yet sufficiently enterprise-like. For example:
　　First, the sale of bus tickets always continues without limit, and passengers often cannot fit on the bus. There is no fixed number for ticket sales. For instance, on the 23rd of last month, for the bus going to Pingshan, more than thirty tickets were sold, but ultimately, there wasn't enough room.
　　Second, there are no fixed standards for technical workers. On the same day, we were riding in a charcoal-fueled vehicle to Pingshan when, just after leaving Shijiazhuang, the bus crashed into a stall, damaging the house, furniture, etc. The child minding the stall was nearly hurt. The bus worker (along with the bus) went back to report, and the same workers were sent back. According to someone from the company, "This is mainly because the driver's skill is not high." According to a passenger: This driver is a novice. Two years ago, he was still loading vehicles in Xingtai. While we were on the bus, the driving was very dangerous. The faster it drove the more difficult the road was, careening and tilting, and at several bridge crossings, the bus nearly overturned. As a result, many people were so frightened that they preferred to walk rather than ride the bus. The bus broke down at Baisha Village, thirty miles from Pingshan, and passengers complained a lot. The breakdown occurred at a bridgehead, because a wheel had fallen off. Fortunately, the breakdown happened early, otherwise, there could have been a dangerous incident. The company should take responsibility for these problems. There is a shortage of skilled workers, and it is right to train them, but in any case, people without sufficient qualifications should not be used for training, because the lives of everyone on board depend on the driver. If there is no confidence, accidents will outweigh the gains. Riding the bus that day was very dangerous, and there had already been a problem, but they were still told to drive.
　　Third, there is no order when taking the bus; people just get on haphazardly. As a result, those with strength get on first and find a good seat, while those without strength who get on later cannot find a place. There are no set rules.
　　I hope the company will inspect and correct these suggestions.

### 建议华北交通运输公司　卖票要有一定数开汽车应负责任

　　建议华北交通运输公司
  　卖票要有一定数开汽车应负责任编辑同志：
    华北交通运输公司（即汽车公司），是公家的一个企业公司，可是在许多地方，还不够企业化。比如：
    一、卖汽车票总是一直卖，车上坐客往往容不下，卖票没有一定数字。比如上月二十三号往平山开汽车，卖了三十多张票，结果挤不下。
    二、对技术工人，没有一定标准。同日，我们坐一辆木炭车到平山，刚出石门，就把汽车开到一家摊子上，撞坏房子、家具等，守摊的小孩差些也出危险。该汽车工人（连汽车）跑回去报告，结果派来还是他们，据该公司的人说“这主要是开车的技术不高。”据一个乘客说：这个开车的是个生手，前年他还在邢台压车。我们坐在车上，开的汽车非常危险，越难走的地方越开的快，一蹦一倾的，有几处桥路开过的地方，差一二指就可翻车，结果吓的许多人宁愿步行都不敢坐车了。车开到离平山三十里的白沙村，也坏了，乘客怨言颇多，车坏在一个桥头，是把车轮掉了。幸坏的还早，不然很可能有危险。这些问题，公司应负责任的，技术工人缺，叫锻炼是对的，但无论如何不能拿无把握的人去锻炼，因为一车人的性命，都在开车的人身上，如无把握，出了危险是得不偿失的。我们那天坐车就非常危险，已经出了问题，但还是叫他们开。
    三、坐汽车无次序，乱坐，结果有力的先上的就坐好，无力的后上的就找不下地方，没有一定的规矩。
    这些建议，希望该公司检查纠正。
