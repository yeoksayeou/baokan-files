　　Handan City Determines Guiding Industrial Policy
  　Primarily Develop State-Owned Industries
  　Concentrate Efforts on Cotton Textile and Iron Industries
  　Operating Factories Better Than Engaging in Commerce
  　Over One Hundred New Workshops Added in Three Months
  　Ironworking and Textile Working Groups Formed
  　To Specifically Lead Industrial Production
    [Our Dispatch] The Handan Municipal Committee convened meetings on December 11th and 13th, and on the 14th, held an enlarged meeting of various district committees, economic units, and relevant departments. They reviewed the implementation of industrial development plans over the past two months and decided on the guiding principles for industrial production moving forward. The Municipal Committee first affirmed that the leadership of industrial production in the past two months had been successful compared to the past. This was reflected in the joint resolution of issues in two factories by the Trade Union and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. For example, at the state-owned Hengtai Weaving Factory, operational management issues were resolved, increasing the net profit per bolt of cloth to 20,000 yuan. At the privately-owned Daxing Iron Factory, the illegal infringement of workers' interests by the capitalists was exposed, and appropriate mediation was provided, enabling production to advance on a truly mutually beneficial path for labor and capital. After the Daxing issue was resolved, two or three other private iron factories also announced a system of wages paid in kind and abolished unreasonable feudal oppression. Although problems still exist, overall, industrial production has taken a step forward. In addition, both the Trade Union and the Industrial Section conducted general surveys of the conditions of state-owned and private factories, which greatly assisted the Municipal Committee's leadership. According to survey materials from the Handan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, industrial profits in the city have already caught up with or exceeded commercial profits. Stimulated by the rise in industrial profits, the increase in industry and handicrafts over the past three months has been greater than that in commerce. The comparison of industrial and commercial profit rates is as follows: The profit of state-owned commerce this year is generally an average profit of 1.5 yuan per yuan invested, but in real terms, it is losing money after accounting for inflation. However, the Hengtai Weaving Factory, operated by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, has earned 4 yuan per yuan invested in a year and a half, with a net profit equivalent to 50% of the capital in real terms. Recent further precise calculations and improved worker efficiency have resulted in a monthly net profit approaching the factory's fixed capital. Thus, each yuan can earn more than 10 yuan per year, greatly exceeding commercial profits. In the private sector, the average profit this year is generally between 2 and 3 yuan per yuan invested. However, the privately-owned Yixing Iron Factory, with a capital of 9 million yuan, reported a net profit of 42 million yuan in ten months, earning more than 4.6 yuan per yuan invested. Another Hengfeng Carding Bow Factory (a component of cotton ginning bows), with a capital of 900,000 yuan, reported a net profit of 3.87 million yuan in four months after opening, earning 4.3 yuan per yuan invested in four months, all exceeding commercial profits. People believe that the main reasons for the higher industrial profits compared to commerce are: the increased demand for urban industrial products in the countryside after the land reform, the unification of the liberated areas, the liberation of large cities, and the unification of currency. This broke the price secrecy of the past isolation and blockade, and prices in various places are now almost the same, thus reducing the speculation of merchants and increasing the convenience of industrial development. Therefore, many merchants have recently changed their past view that "running a factory is not as profitable as engaging in commerce," and instead are shouting: "Operating commerce is not profitable; we must turn to industrial production." This is indeed the trend. According to statistics for September, October, and November in the city: the number of industrial and commercial enterprises increased by 200, of which 114 were industrial and handicraft, and 86 were commercial. According to responsible comrades in the city: since the policy was rectified half a year ago, the funds invested in industrial production each month have been more than 10 million yuan. The important reasons for this, in addition to the fact that our Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce is well known to the broad masses, is profit. Because no matter how good the policy is, private capital will not invest without profit. The Municipal Committee believes that the shortcomings are: First, the municipal leadership organs have not "placed" industrial production "in an appropriate position" and "a more important position." This is reflected in the fact that no one in the Municipal Committee is specifically responsible for leading industrial production. After the plan was formulated, the Municipal Committee did not hold a single meeting on industrial production; although the comrades below investigated a lot of materials, the Municipal Committee leadership failed to help them analyze and research, and to instruct them on future actions. It is also reflected in the fact that after the plan was formulated, a certain amount of manpower was not organized, and the city's top priority task - industrial production - was simply handed over to the Industrial Section and the Trade Union, and some parts of the plan have not even been implemented to this day. For example, the Production Promotion Society has been clamoring for five months, but has not yet been established. The planned egg-beating factory, oil press, and the spinning machine to be transformed, have not yet taken concrete action. The reasons for the above shortcomings can be summarized in three points: (1) The plan itself has problems—it is too principled and too abstract. The impression it gives is that it is grandiose and impractical, so it is now difficult to say which ones have been completed and which ones have failed, because it is not specific, and not based on the basic conditions of Handan. (2) The content of urban construction is not clear. Although it is said in words and in writing that industry and commerce should be developed and the city should be built, in practice it is not known where to start. Therefore, after the urban plan was formulated, most of the efforts were devoted to party rectification and citizen production. Coupled with the constraints of rural viewpoints, when developing production is mentioned, it is naturally twisted to citizen production. This shows that ideologically it is not clear that urban production is mainly industrial production; it is not understood that industrial production is the basic content of urban construction. (3) The mechanical application of rural political tasks and the transfer of rural division of labor. For example, at the beginning of the formulation of the winter three-month plan, it was determined that production should be the main focus, combined with party rectification. However, when the Prefectural Committee instructed various counties to focus on party rectification and land reform, combined with production, Handan, although only a third of its population was rural (two-thirds of the livelihoods of these rural people depended on sideline income under urban industry and commerce), also turned to party rectification and land reform. After the District Party Committee pointed out that in areas where land has been largely divided equally, production should be the main focus, it turned back again. However, the specific content of urban production has not been studied. For example, the higher authorities instructed various counties to generally divide the work under the tasks of party rectification, land reform, and production, with the Party Committee leading party rectification and land reform, and the government responsible for production. Although Handan is a city, it was also copied in the same way, with the result that the industrial and commercial enterprises that accounted for the vast majority of Handan had to fall solely on the shoulders of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in the entire organizational leadership. After reviewing the above points, the conditions for the development of industrial production in Handan were then analyzed. Everyone believed that the conditions for developing industry here are more favorable than in other cities in Southern Hebei. First of all, from the perspective of natural conditions, Handan is located between mountains and plains, with coal and iron in the west and cotton and grain in the east, and transportation is particularly convenient - river transportation, highways, and crisscrossing railways (Pinghan, Hanshe, and the Handguan under construction). Secondly, since the liberation of Handan three years ago, state-owned and private commerce has developed greatly, and its capital accumulation has laid the foundation for the development of industry, especially the strong state-owned capital, which has provided convenience for the development of industry. Thirdly, the vast countryside liberated from feudal shackles has an increasing demand for urban industrial products; in addition, industrial profits are gradually rising or have exceeded commercial profits, so the development of industry and handicrafts has been more than that of commerce recently. It is reported that some state-owned enterprises also want to turn to industrial production. Under such circumstances, the Municipal Committee must be prepared and must put industrial production in an "appropriate position in the leadership work" of the municipality. The specific requirements are: (1) Concentrate efforts on the cotton textile industry and the iron industry, consolidate existing achievements. Explore industrial working methods and create industrial working experience. At the same time, call on state-owned stores that may be converted to industrial production to turn to the industrial direction; help solve the difficulties of those who have decided to turn to industrial production; banks have announced that the interest on loans for state-owned industries can be further lowered, or even interest-free for a period (limited to state-owned). The assistance to private industry has been inconsistent in the past, sometimes leaning left and sometimes leaning right. This time, it is clearly stipulated that: the main tasks are to resolve labor-capital disputes, provide a certain amount of loan support, provide product market information from various places, and grant preferential treatment in tax reduction, exemption, and postponement. Between state-owned and private industries, it is clearly stipulated that the development of state-owned industries should be the main focus, and work should be carried out on the basis of state-owned industries. (2) In terms of manpower allocation and organization, the Municipal Committee decided to draw two Municipal Committee comrades to specifically lead industrial production and establish two working groups for ironworking and textiles. Under the general guidelines, each group will formulate specific plans and establish inspection and summary systems to regularly study materials and solve problems. It is reported that after the system was stipulated, the Municipal Committee listened to the Industrial Section's report on the iron industry situation on the 16th, and the entire industrial production began to move towards a path with leadership and planning.

　　邯郸市确定领导工业方针
  　主要发展公营工业
  　集中力量做好棉织铁工业
  　经商不如办工厂
  　三个月增加作坊百余家
  　组成铁工、纺织两个工作组
  　专门领导工业生产
    【本报讯】邯郸市委于十二月十一、十三日两次集会，并于十四日召开各区委、各经济单位、及有关部门的扩大会。检查近两月来对发展工业计划的执行，与决定今后对工业生产的领导方针。该市委首先肯定，近两月来对工业生产的领导，与过去相比是有成绩的。这表现在职工会与工商局联合解决了两个工厂的问题上，例如：在公营恒太织布厂，解决了经营管理问题，使每匹布纯利提高到二万元。在私营大兴铁工厂，对资方非法侵犯工人利益的行为做了揭发，又给以适当调解，使生产在真正劳资两利的路途上前进。大兴问题解决后，有两三家私营铁厂，也随即宣布了实物工资制，与废除不合理的封建压迫。虽还不无问题，但总是把工业生产向前推进了一步。另外，职工会与工业科都做了对公私工厂一般情况的调查，这对市委领导帮助很大。从邯郸市工商局的调查材料看：该市工业利润业已赶上或超过了营商利润。且在工业利润上升的刺激下，近三月来工业与手工业的增加，均比商业为多。工商利润率对比是这样：本年度公营商业的利润，一般是每元平均获利一元五角，按实物保本还赔钱。而工商局经营的恒太织布厂，在一年半之内，每元获利四元，以实物计算，纯利等于资金的百分之五十。最近该厂进一步精确计算，提高工人劳动效率的结果，每月所赚纯利已接近它固定资金的数字。如是每年每元就可获利十元以上，大大超过了营商利润。在私商方面，本年一般每元平均获利二——三元之间。而私营益兴铁工厂，资金九百万元，他自报十个月纯利四千二百万元，每元获利四元六角还多。另一恒丰绞条（弹花弓上的一种）工厂，资金九十万元，开张四个月，自报纯利三百八十七万元，四个月之间每元就赚四元三角，均超过了营商利润。对形成工业利润高于商业的原因，人们认为主要是：土改后农村对城市工业产品要求的提高，与各解放区联成一片，大城市解放及货币统一。这样就打破了过去封锁隔离时期的物价秘密，且各处物价相差无几，因此减少了商人的投机性，增大了工业发展的便利。所以近来有不少商人，变换了过去所谓“办工厂不如干商业赚钱”的论调，而相反的喊着：“营商不赚钱，非向工业生产转不可。”事实的发展也是这样的，据该市九月、十月、十一月的统计：全市增多工商户数二百家，其中工业与手工业占一百一十四家，商业八十六家。另据该市负责同志谈：端正政策以来半年间，每月投资于工业生产的资金，均在一万万元以上。其重要原因，除我党保护工商政策为广大群众所深知外，就是利润。因为政策再好，没有利润，私资是不干的。缺点方面，该市委认为：首先是市政领导机关，没有象把工业生产“放到适当位置”与“更重要的地位”。这表现在市委没有一个人专门负责领导工业生产。计划订出后，市委没有开过一次有关工业生产的会议；下面同志调查了许多材料，市委领导上未能帮助其分析、研究，以及指示今后的行动方向。还表现在计划订出后，没有组织一定力量，而把整个城市计划第一位的任务——工业生产，简单的交给了工业科与职工会，甚而部分计划至今还没有人去执行。例如：生产推进社叫嚷了五个月之久，至今尚未成立，计划与恢复的打蛋厂、榨油厂、和要改造的纺纱机，至今亦还没有具体行动等。形成上述缺点的原因，总起说来有三：（一）是计划本身有毛病——太原则。太抽象。给人的印象是大而无当，以致现在检查起来，都很难说那些已经完成，那些已经破产，原因就是不具体，不是根据邯市基本情况决定的。（二）是对城市建设的内容不明确，虽在口头上、书面上说是发展工商业，建设城市，但实际做起来就不知从何着手。所以城市计划定出后，绝大部分力量都去从事整党与市民生产。加以农村观点的束缚，一提发展生产，便很自然地扭到市民生产方面去。这说明在思想上还不明确城市生产主要是工业生产；还不懂得工业生产是城市建设的基本内容。（三）是机械地套取农村的政治任务、与搬运农村的分工形式。比如在制定冬季三月计划之初，确定以生产为主，结合整党。但在地委指示各县以整党土改为主、结合生产时，邯市虽仅有占人口三分之一的农村（这些农村群众的生活来源，三分之二仰赖于城市工商业下的副业收入），但也就扭转为整党土改为主。在区党委指出土地大体平分了的地区，应以生产为主后，才又扭过来。然对城市生产的具体内容是什么，却没有研究。再如，上级指示各县，在整党土改与生产任务下，一般分工是党委领导整党土改，政府负责生产。邯郸虽为城市，然也依样画葫芦地画下来，结果占邯市绝大部分的工商业，在整个组织领导上，便不得不落在工商局的单独的肩上。在检查了上述各点之后，随即分析了邯市发展工业生产的条件。大家认为此间发展工业的条件，较冀南各城更为优越。首先从自然条件上看，邯市地处山地与平原之间，西有煤铁，东有棉粮，交通格外方便——河运、公路，以及纵横四伸的铁路（平汉、邯涉，及建筑中的邯馆）。其次，邯郸解放三年来，公私商业有了极大发展，其资本积累已奠定了发展工业的条件，特别是公营资金的雄厚，更给发展工业以便利。再次，解除了封建束缚的广大农村，对城市工业产品的要求日增；加以工业利润逐渐上升或已超过营商，所以近来工业与手工业的发展都较商业为多。据悉：公营企业也有一些要转向工业生产。在这样的情况下，市委必须有所准备，必须把工业生产放在市政“领导工作的适当位置”。具体要求是：（一）集中力量做棉织业与铁工业，巩固现有成绩。摸索工业工作方法，创造工业工作经验。同时，号召以动员可能转工业生产的公营商店，向工业方向转；帮助已经决定转向工业生产的解决困难；银行已宣布公营工业贷款的利息还可再低些，或者一个时期的免息（仅限公营）。对私营工业的帮助，过去忽左忽右，此次明确规定：主要是解决劳资纠纷，给予一定数量的贷款扶助，供给各地产品行情，税收中给以减征、免征、缓征的优待。在公私工业之间，又明确以发展公营工业为主，以公营工业为基础去开展工作。（二）在力量配备与组织上，市委会决议抽两个市委同志专门领导工业生产，成立铁工、纺织两个工作组。在总方针下，各组分别制定具体计划，并建立检查与总结制度，定期研究材料，解决问题。闻该项制度规定后，市委会已于十六日，听取工业科关于铁工业情况汇报，整个工业生产开始走向有领导、有计划的道路。　　　　　（林里）
