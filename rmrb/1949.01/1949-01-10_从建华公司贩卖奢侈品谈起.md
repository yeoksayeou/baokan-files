　　Starting with Jianhua Company's Sale of Luxury Goods
　　By our reporter Tian Liu
　　Recently, the reporter made a visit to the state-owned trade organizations and public-owned stores (including those run by government agencies) in Linqing and Handan. It is clear that all state-owned and public-owned trade stores in the two cities are selling and supplying a large number of mass-produced products, means of production, and daily necessities, ensuring the constant balance of prices and providing great leadership and support to the industries and businesses of these cities, leading them towards development and prosperity. In order to better fulfill the tasks given to them by the state, the reporter believes there are still areas worth improving.
　　On December 1, the "Handan Daily" published an advertisement from the Jianhua Company's retail department of the Jinnan Public-owned Stores: "Our department has newly arrived: a large quantity of Qing City cloth, Keqi cloth, corduroy, white market cloth, colored striped cloth, blue market linen, Shanghai towels, Shimen towels, woolen blankets, copper basins, steel needles, Baolan scented soap, Ruquan scented soap, Grape scented soap, Meiju scented soap, Shuangmei hair oil, Xiangyu shoe polish, Baihualu perfume, Yanrong powder, Shuang'e powder, moisturizing cream, snow cream, Jin Yu toothpaste, Anchor toothbrush, large bag of Lion tooth powder, record needles, garters, shoelaces with eyelets, ping pong balls, pencils, pencil sharpeners, chemical black and yellow buckles, playing cards, oiled paper, newsprint, white sugar, matches."
　　The vast majority of the items listed here are foreign goods, and the vast majority are luxury goods and non-essential items. Jianhua Company is a public-owned store in the entire Jinnan area, with branches in each special district, and the head office is in Weixian, where there is also such a retail department. Obviously, this practice cannot fulfill the task given by the Jinnan District Party Committee of "supporting mass production and cooperating with financial tasks." "Making money" is the first, and perhaps only, consideration of Jianhua Company. In October, the Linqing City Jianhua Branch Company and the Municipal Party Committee jointly agreed to establish a Coal and Iron Company to support the development of the city's iron industry; when the reporter visited the company in late November, Inspector Ma said: "Coal should be produced in large quantities, as it can make money; iron is not being produced, as there is little profit in that." In order to make money, the Handan Jianhua Third Branch went to Jinan after Jinan was liberated, and went to Luoyang where cigarette rolling paper was cheap. The Linqing City Jianhua First Branch even went north to Dalian and south to Henan to find ways to make money. In order to make money, they forgot about the masses in their own area, forgot about supporting production, and even sold foreign luxury goods. "Making money" is necessary, as only by continuously accumulating and expanding public capital can we more effectively sell and supply the masses with mass-produced products, means of production, and daily necessities, support the development of industry and agriculture, and lead commerce towards proper prosperity; but is it necessary to sell foreign luxury goods like the Jianhua retail department in order to make money? Absolutely not. Handan has more proof of this: the Yutai Freight Station of the Taihang District Public-owned Stores in Handan City, which only deals in mountain products, has close ties with more than thirty county and district cooperatives in Taihang. It transports the masses' mountain products – peppercorns, peach kernels, persimmon cakes, etc. – to Handan City, and the Yutai Freight Station helps them sell them, completing transactions and making purchases. In the past three months, it has sold more than 400,000 catties, and through the Taihang Trading Company's Handan Salt Store, it has supplied more than 4 million catties of table salt to the people of Taihang. In three months, Yutai Freight Station has also made a profit of more than 100%. This is an example of doing business that is closely connected with the masses, benefiting the masses, and at the same time making money for itself. There are also many cases of making considerable profits by directly engaging in production: for example, the Handan Public-owned Hengtai Textile Factory started operations in May of the year before last with a capital of 48,000 yuan (People's currency, same below), which was equivalent to 41,739 catties of rice at the then-current price. By October of last year, it had earned 230,000 yuan in silver dollars, which was equivalent to 59,148 catties of rice at the current price, resulting in a net profit of 17,409 catties. The number of looms has also increased from eight at the beginning to the current twenty-two. Unfortunately, whether in Linqing or Handan, there are too few businesses like Yutai Freight Station that are closely connected with the masses, and too few industries like Hengtai Textile Factory. Among the more than 50 public-owned economic units in Handan City, only three are also engaged in industrial production (two textile factories and one iron factory), accounting for less than one-fifteenth of the total. On the other hand, there are many businesses like the Jianhua retail department. In Handan, for example, there are more than ten of them within sight on Heping Street. It is necessary and essential to quickly shut down such retail departments and turn to businesses that are closely related to the masses. The reporter believes that economic units of public-owned and government-run nature should engage in industrial and agricultural production that are closely related to the production of the masses, and should not engage in the sale of foreign luxury goods like the Jianhua Company retail department.

　　从建华公司贩卖奢侈品谈起
    本报记者  田流
    最近记者对临清、邯郸两市的国营贸易机关、公营商店（包括机关生产）作了一次访问，可以看出，两市所有的国营、公营贸易商店，都大量的推销着与供给着群众的生产品、生产资料及日用品，保证着物价的始终平衡，对各该城市的工商业，给了巨大的领导和扶助，使之走向发展和繁荣。为着更好的完成国家所给予他们的任务，记者认为还有值得改进之处。
    十二月一日“邯郸日报”上登着冀南公营商店建华公司门市部一个广告：“本部新到：大批青市布、克机布、条绒布、白市布、色条布、蓝市林，上海毛巾、石门毛巾、线毯铜盆钢针、苞兰香皂、乳泉香皂、葡萄香皂、美菊香皂、双妹生发油、香鱼鞋油、白花露香粉、艳容香粉、双鹅粉、润面油、雪花膏、金鱼牙膏、铁锚牙刷、大袋狮子牙粉、唱片钢针、腿带、气眼鞋带、乒乓球、铅笔、铅笔刀、化学黑黄扣、普克牌、油光纸、白报纸、白糖、火柴。”
    这儿列举的，绝大部分是外货，也绝大部分是奢侈品和非必需品。建华公司是冀南全区的公营商店，各专区都有分公司，总公司在威县，那里也有这样的一个门市部。很明显，这种作法是不能完成冀南区党委所给予的“扶助群众生产、配合财政任务”的。“赚钱”是建华公司首先考虑、甚至唯一考虑的问题。十月，临清市建华一分公司同市委共同协议成立煤铁公司，以扶助该市铁工业的发展；十一月下旬记者去该公司访问时，马监委说：“煤是要大量搞，能赚钱；铁不搞啦，那东西没什么利。”为着赚钱，邯郸建华三分公司于济南解放后去济南，洛阳卷烟盘纸便宜去洛阳，临清市建华一分公司甚至北去大连、南下河南去找赚钱的门路。为着赚钱，就忘掉了本区群众，忘掉了扶助生产，甚至去贩卖外货奢侈品。“赚钱”是必要的，只有公营资本不断积累扩大，才能更有力的推销供给群众生产品、生产资料及日用品，扶助工农业的发展，领导商业走向正当的繁荣；但是不是一定要象建华门市部那样去贩卖洋货奢侈品才能赚钱呢？完全不是这样。邯郸就有更多的这方面的证明：太行区公营商店在邯市的裕太货栈、它完全经营山货，太行三十多个县区合作社和它紧密的联系着，把群众的山货——花椒、桃仁、柿饼等运到邯市、裕太货栈便帮助其推销，成交或买卖。最近三个月已推销四十余万斤，并经过太行贸易公司邯郸盐店供给太行人民四百万斤以上的食盐。三个月裕太货栈也获利在一倍以上。这是经营同群众密切联系的商业，使群众获得利益，同时自己也赚了钱的例子。还有直接经营生产事业也获利不少的：如邯市公营恒太纺织工厂前年五月开工，资金四万八千元（人民票，下同），按当时物价折米四万一千七百三十九斤，到去年十月赚洋二十三万元，以时价折米五万九千一百四十八斤，合实赚一万七千四百零九斤。织布机也由开办时的八台增到目前的二十二台了。可惜，无论在临清或邯郸，象裕太货栈那样同群众密切联系着的商业，象恒太纺织工厂那样的工业是太少了。在邯市五十余公营经济单位中，只有三家兼当工业生产（两个纺织厂，一个铁工厂），数量上不及十五分之一。而象建华门市部那样的经营却是很多的，以邯郸为例，仅在和平大街举目所及，便有十多家，迅速结束这样的门市部，转向同群众密切有关的营业，是应该的，也是必需的。记者认为：公营和机关生产性质的经济单位，应该经营工业农业生产事业；同群众生产密切相关，而不应该经营象建华公司门市部那样的贩卖洋货奢侈品。
