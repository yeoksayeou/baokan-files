　　Rakosi – Mátyás Rákosi is the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party and the current Deputy Prime Minister. He participated in the labor movement at a young age and was one of the founders of the Hungarian Communist Party. After the Hungarian working class overthrew the bourgeois government in 1919, he was elected as a government commissioner. Soon, counter-revolutionary armed forces rose again with the support of imperialism, and the revolution temporarily failed. He then went to the Soviet Union. In the winter of 1924, he returned to his country to continue to lead the party's work arduously. Unfortunately, he was betrayed by a traitor, and the headquarters of the Hungarian Communist underground organization headed by Rakosi was destroyed, and he was sentenced to death. However, under the joint protest of the world's working class, and his own tenacious struggle, the reactionaries had to change the sentence to eight years of imprisonment. However, when his sentence was about to expire in 1934, the reactionaries sentenced him to life imprisonment. Later, due to the development of the international situation and the heroic struggle of the people at home, he regained his freedom in October 1940 and went to the Soviet Union again. When the German invaders invaded Hungary and the reactionaries fled far away, he led the Hungarian Communist Party to closely unite the masses and various democratic parties to form the "National Independence Liberation Front" to combat the German invaders and finally achieve the final victory. In the general election in September 1947, the Hungarian Communist Party won the top position in the parliament, and Rakosi was elected as the Deputy Prime Minister.
　　Zachariadis – The current General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party and the leader of the Greek Democratic Army. He was born in Adrianople.

Later, in Constantinople, he formed the first communist center. In 1928, he was falsely accused of being the "protagonist" of a "political murder case" and was arrested. Later, he escaped the imprisonment of the reactionaries and ran to the Soviet Union to study at the Oriental Institute. In 1931, he served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and the secretary of the Balkan Bureau. On July 10, 1947, he wrote an article in the Greek Communist Party's newspaper, calling on the Greek people to organize a democratic government that truly represents the people, which has made a great contribution to the victorious Greek situation today.
　　Marty – One of the secretaries of the French Communist Party and a veteran fighter of the Communist International. During the First World War, he was a naval engineering officer.
