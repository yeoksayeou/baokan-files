Taihang Electric Dispatch: The Taihang Fifth Administrative Office convened an economic conference to study how to ensure the smooth issuance of the new currency and stabilize prices. It was determined that: First, public-owned stores, organizations, and production units should appropriately regulate materials. Organizational production should make profits under the principle of stabilizing prices, so that every merchant understands that excessive price fluctuations are detrimental to themselves and the entire liberated area. Public-owned stores should unite all merchants and residents to strive for regulating materials and stabilizing prices. Second, cherishing the new currency also means cherishing the old currency: The local currencies of the liberated areas were issued in the past under conditions of enemy blockade and division. They played a great role in the economic struggle against the enemy, protecting the property of the liberated areas, developing the production of the liberated areas, and establishing an independent and self-reliant economic foundation. The government now circulates them at a fixed ratio, and will also redeem them at a fixed ratio in the future. The government is responsible to the people. Therefore, during the circulation period, do not be fond of the new and tired of the old, do not prefer large denominations to small denominations, or secretly lower the price of small denominations, as these are all wrong. Finally, it was proposed that the economic committees of each county should be improved to unify the leadership of various departments and ensure the smooth issuance of the new currency.
    (Taihang Fifth Office of the People's Bank of China)
    [Taihang News] The comrades of the Chu Wang Town Public Office in Zhangnan District One made a market promotion to facilitate the use of the new "People's Bank of China" currency by citizens. On December 13th, comrades Wang Yurui, Li Xiu＠, and others from the town public office divided into two groups to conduct market promotions in the livestock market, cotton market, oil shop, and grain shop. They explained that in the past, the liberated areas were divided by the enemy, and the currency system was not unified, resulting in many types of currency. Now, the three major liberated areas of North China, East China, and Northwest China have become one, so in order to facilitate the exchange of materials by the masses, it was decided to establish the People's Bank of China. The new currency will circulate in the three major liberated areas of North China, East China, and Northwest China, and will be universally used throughout China in the future. Before the old banknotes are withdrawn, public and private transactions in the market will continue to be used as usual at the exchange rate. The Chu Wang Bookstore also wrote the benefits of the new currency in popular sentences on the blackboard, and a group of people immediately surrounded the bookstore to listen. Some people said, "Our banknotes are for fighting against Lao Jiang. The more valuable the new banknotes are, the more the enemy's banknotes will collapse." Li Shulan and Li Xi, who run restaurants, also said, "The unification of banknotes is very beneficial to us. It doesn't take much effort to do business, and it's not difficult to recognize the banknotes." (尹光武、郭日新、王爱民、常文道、王好义)

　　统一推行新币还要爱护旧币
  　太行确定稳定物价办法
    【太行电】太行五专署召开经济会议，研究如何保证新币顺利发行及稳定物价办法，确定：第一、公营商店机关生产要适当的调剂物资，机关生产要在平稳物价这一原则下赚钱，使每个商人了解物价波动太大，对自己、对整个解放区不利，公营商店要团结所有商民，为调剂物资、平稳物价而努力。第二、爱护新币也要爱护旧币：各解放区的本位币，是过去在敌人封割局面下发行的，在对敌经济斗争上曾起了伟大作用，保护了解放区的财产，发展了解放区的生产，建立了独立自主的经济基础；政府现在按固定比值流通，以后也是按固定比值兑收的。政府是对人民负责的。因此在流通期间不要喜新厌旧，要大票不要小票，或暗中压低小票价格，这都是错误的。最后提出：各县的经委会要健全起来，统一各部门领导，保证新币顺利发行。

    【太行讯】漳南一区楚旺镇公所同志，为便于市民使用“中国人民银行”新币，特作集市宣传。十二月十三日，镇公所王玉瑞、李秀＠等同志，分成两组在牲口市、棉花市、油行、粮行各处，分别进行集市宣传。说明过去解放区因被敌人分割，币制不统一，以致货币种类多，现华北、华东、西北三大解放区已连成一片，为使群众物资交换便利，决定成立中国人民银行。新币在华北、华东西北三大解放区流通，将来全中国都能通用，在旧票没有收回以前，市场公私交易按比价折合照常使用等。楚旺书店也用通俗句子在黑板上写新币好处，当时就有一群人围绕起书店来听。有些人说：“咱这票是给老蒋作斗争的，新票越顶钱，敌票越垮台。”饭铺李树兰、李喜也说，票子统一，对咱们有很大好处，做买卖不费手续，认票也不困难。”（尹光武、郭日新、王爱民、常文道、王好义）
