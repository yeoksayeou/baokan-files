    Huada Widely Establishes Veterinary Stations
    Curing Livestock Diseases Welcomed by the Masses

[Our Newspaper Dispatches] The Agricultural College of Huada pays attention to cultivating veterinary talents, and has achieved preliminary results in the past year and a half. Their learning method is to lecture and practice simultaneously, and use the method of rewarding veterinarians to make the old doctors willing to teach their skills to the new students. Recently, it has also proposed to commend new technical talents to further promote technology. Now, veterinary stations have been set up on both the east and west major roads. On the 720-mile-long avenue to the east, passing through Lucheng, Licheng Henan Store, Yetao, Wu'an, Handan, Linluoguan, Xingtai, Gaoyi, and Shimen, ten veterinary work stations have been established. Veterinary stations have also been established in the west through Jincheng, Yangcheng, and other places. In the area with more factories on that line, there are many livestock transporting coal and iron. A veterinary hospital was specially established in May last year. By the end of November, a total of 618 livestock had been successfully treated. The Changzhi Internship General Hospital alone sees an average of more than ten heads of livestock every day, and a maximum of sixty to seventy heads a day. The veterinary work station established in Yincheng provides free diagnosis and treatment for the livestock of the grain transporting masses. In November, the station counted 153 successfully treated livestock, of which serious illnesses accounted for one-third. Comrades from the work station also organized medical teams to treat livestock for the masses in nearby villages. For example, Comrades Yao Youwang and Qin Shutian accepted the requests of the masses and went to Donghuo Village to see seriously ill livestock, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. The masses in the village also requested the establishment of a work station in the village. (Wang Kongwen)

　　华大广设兽医站
  　治好牲口病群众很欢迎
    【本报讯】华大农学院注意培养兽医人材，一年半以来，获得初步成绩。其学习方法是一面讲一面实习，并用奖励兽医的办法，使旧有的医师乐意把技术教给新的学员。最近又提出表扬新的技术人材，使技术更加推广。现在东西两条大路，都设有兽医站。往东经过潞城、黎城河南店、冶陶、武安、邯郸、临洛关、邢台、高邑、石门七百二十里长的一条大道上，设立了十个兽医工作站。往西经晋城、阳城等地，同样也有兽医站的设立。在那一线工厂较多的地方，拉运煤铁牲口很多，去年五月特设立兽医院一座，到十一月底，共看好牲口六百一十八头。光长治实习总院，每天平均即看十多头，最多一天看到六、七十头。在荫城设的兽医工作站，运粮群众的牲口有了病免费诊治，十一月份该站统计看好牲口一百五十三头。其中重病占三分之一。工作站同志并组织医疗小组，到附近村庄给群众牲口治病。如姚有旺、秦书田二同志接受群众要求，到东火村去看重病牲口，受到群众热烈欢迎，该村群众并要求在该村设立工作站。（王孔文）
