Several Problems Seen from Collecting Old Loans
　　Organized by Lan Cun

　　Last winter, our district generally carried out the work of recovering old agricultural loans. Some places achieved considerable success by the end of November. For example, Tang County in the North Yue District recovered 80% of its agricultural loans, while Lingshou and Xingtang recovered more than 50%. Weixian County in the Jinnan District recovered 73%. Other regions have also begun to pay attention to this work in general. The experiences and lessons learned from various places in collecting old loans are summarized here for reference.

　　(1) As long as agricultural loans are truly used to support production, the work of recovering loans is also easily accomplished. For example, in the Seventh District of Xingtang, Zhao Laocai and two other households in Zhao Qilifeng borrowed 640 catties of grain, bought livestock, and cultivated their land well. They automatically repaid the principal and interest on time. In Xijia Village, Gao Mingbao and eight households borrowed 1,000 catties of grain to restore the weaving industry because they lacked capital. They not only paid back the principal and interest on time but were also very grateful. In Yashaizhai, Weixian County, a loan of 320,000 was used the previous year to purchase agricultural implements for the whole county. The masses benefited, and there were no difficulties in collecting the payments. Conversely, if there is a purely charitable or relief-oriented viewpoint when issuing loans, it is not easy to recover them. For example, in Sunzhai, Weixian County, the work team lent money to three old women who could not produce. When collecting the loans, they said, "Isn't this supposed to be taking care of the poor? Do you still want it back? We don't have it!" (These people should fall within the scope of relief – Editor). As for loans that are not used for their intended purpose or are wasted on eating and drinking, it is naturally more difficult to recover them.

　　(2) The amount and term of loans should be determined according to the different needs of different production endeavors. It is not possible to stipulate the same amount and the same repayment period in an egalitarian manner. For example, last year in Tang County, when issuing grain loans for livestock, some places gave the masses enough money to buy large livestock. Buying large livestock could be used for farming or兼营transportation, and they all gained benefits and were able to repay the loans on time. Some places issued loans equally, about 300 catties per household. As a result, some could only buy small livestock, which could not be used for production. Also, for well-digging loans, an average of only about 30 catties of rice was lent for each well. As a result, they dug very shallow small earthen wells, which quickly became unusable. In Laoniugou, Xingtang, there were 37 households, and 30 households borrowed grain, averaging over 100 catties per household. As a result, none of them were effective, and there were difficulties in repayment. For loans to support agricultural production, such as buying livestock, the term should not be too short. For example, some livestock loans in Tang County had to be repaid "after only one autumn," and the farmers felt that the time was too tight to manage. Such egalitarian loan collection methods, or those that require repayment at the same time regardless of the purpose, are difficult to universally play their due role in supporting production. The masses are not happy when borrowing, and they are not happy when repaying.

　　(3) The collection of old loans should be carried out by showing concern for the masses' production and checking the role of the loans. The loan policy should be patiently explained to the masses, focusing on the explanation that recovering old loans is for the purpose of issuing new loans. When the Puyang County branch of the Ji-Lu-Yu Bank collected payments in Lijialou, First District, they first worked to unify the thinking of the cadres, making them realize that if loans were not recovered, winter production could not be supported. They also individually visited several households in the village to inquire about the use of the loans after they were received and to understand the general production situation. Two days later, a mass meeting was held, combined with the central task at the time (wheat requisition), to explain the loan policy. After the meeting, the loan households were left behind to let each household talk about the use and role of their loans, inspiring them to voluntarily and consciously repay the loans. Then, the spirit and methods of collection were discussed. If you have money, repay with money; if you don't have money, you can also repay with physical objects. The valuation of physical objects is generally slightly higher than the market price. The masses all said, "It is right to repay the loans. They helped us in our time of need before, and now we can use grain to offset our debts at a high price. Isn't this benefiting us?" As a result, the due loans were cleared in two days, and many loans that were not due were also repaid. In Licheng, Taihang, the method of specific accounting and unifying the thinking of the masses was used, and more than ten villages, including Changzhenbei, quickly recovered their loans. Conversely, some places collect loans for the sake of collecting loans, simply announcing the collection of loans to the loan households and saying, "If you don't repay on time, the village cadres will be responsible," etc. For example, the Kunwu branch of the Ji-Lu-Yu Bank used such a simple method to collect payments in Longchangzhi Village, which resulted in opposition from the village cadres and the masses refusing to repay. Also, in some villages in the Seventh District of Quyang County, North Yue District, because of the disaster the previous year, and the loan households were mostly newly liberated farmers, they felt difficulties in their current lives, and the loan amounts were also large. It was indeed difficult to recover all the loans immediately; however, individual cadres did not help solve the actual difficulties of these households, but simply forced them to repay. One district cadre even announced, "No matter what kind of household, everyone must pay off the loans. You have to sell your pots and pans to pay. Complete it within ten days. If that village cannot pay, the cadres will bear all the responsibility." Yan Linzi, a poor peasant group cadre in Gouli Village, was afraid that he would not be able to complete the task of collecting loans and even wanted to hang himself. Hu Fulai, a poor peasant in Dongli Village, First District, only borrowed money in July last year to buy a donkey. In order to repay the loan, he sold the donkey again. It was quite common in other villages in Quyang to sell means of production to repay loans. This shows that collecting loans for the sake of collecting loans will inevitably cause some undesirable consequences. This also raises a question, that is, for some disaster-stricken people who are really unable to repay all their loans, there should be flexible measures, or they should be allowed to pay off the interest first, complete other procedures, and allow an extension as appropriate, while actively organizing them to produce to repay the agricultural loans. This will not violate the basic principle of loans for supporting production. In Xiaoshanzhai, Gu Duiping, Jiulongshan, Beipo, and Xiaozhai in Licheng, Taihang, a total of 22,500 yuan in new currency was borrowed, and life was very difficult, so they could not repay. They used the method of organizing the masses to dig herbs and chop firewood, and they paid off all the loans in seven days.

　　(4) There should be specialized institutions or dedicated personnel responsible for issuing and collecting loans in rural areas, and they should be combined. In places with promotion agencies, it is best to handle it through the village agency. On the one hand, it supports the development of the village agency's business, and on the other hand, it is also convenient for inspection and recovery. In villages where the village agency is not sound, such as Quyang Fifth District in the North Yue, an agricultural loan committee was established, and issuance, inspection, and recovery are all done through it, which is very convenient. Therefore, 80% of the agricultural loans in the Fifth District had been recovered by the end of November. In Suning County, Jizhong, because loan issuance and collection could not be combined, the loan cadres did not care about催收, and there was no dedicated person in charge of催收. Many loans were due during the wheat sowing season, and the county agency cadres were only busy with the wheat sowing work, and no one went to collect them. By the time they could go to催收, it was just the time for the autumn征收, which increased the difficulty of 催收.

### 从收旧贷中看到的几个问题

　　从收旧贷中看到的几个问题
    蓝村整理
    去冬本区各地普遍进行了催收旧贷工作，有些地方十至十一月底即已获得相当成绩。如北岳区唐县收回农贷百分之八十，灵寿、行唐收回百分之五十以上，冀南区威县收回百分之七十三。其他地区，一般也已开始注意这一工作。现将各地收旧贷中的经验教训综合写出，供参考。
    （一）农贷只要真正用于扶植生产，收贷工作也容易完成。如行唐七区赵七里峰赵老采等三户贷粮六百四十斤，买了牲口，把地养种好了，到期自动将本息还清。西家村高明保八户。织布没本钱，贷粮一千斤恢复了织布业，到期不但把本息还清，并且非常感激。威县鸭水寨前年贷款三十二万，全县购买了农具，群众得到了实惠，收款时完全不感困难。反之，如放款时有单纯恩赐救济观点的，都不易收回。如威县孙寨工作组将款贷给三个不能生产的老太太，收贷时她们说：“不是照顾贫民吗？还要？俺没有！”（这些人应属于救济范围——编者）至于贷非所用或贷了吃喝浪费了的，自然更难收回。
    （二）贷款的数量与期限，应根据不同的生产事业之不同需要而定，不能平均主义地一律规定同等数量，同期归还。如去年唐县发放牲口贷粮，有的地方群众拿到足够买大牲口的款，买了大牲口能进行耕地或兼营运输，都得到了利益，即能如期还款。有的地方平均发放，每户三百斤左右，结果有的只好买小牲口，不能生产。又如打井贷粮平均每眼只贷给米三十斤左右，结果打了很浅的小土井，很快就不能使了。行唐老牛沟有三十七户，三十户贷粮，每户平均百余斤，结果都不顶事，归还时都有困难。为了扶植农业生产的贷款，如买牲口等，期限不应过短，如唐县有的牲口贷款“只经一个秋”就要收回，结果农民感到时间太紧，转不过来。象这样平均主义的或不问什么用途都同期归还的贷款收款办法，对扶助生产很难普遍起到应有的作用，群众贷时不痛快，还时也不痛快。
    （三）催收旧贷应从关心群众生产、检查贷款作用中来进行，应耐心向群众讲明贷款政策，着重说明收旧为了贷新。冀鲁豫濮阳县支行在一区李家楼催款时，首先打通干部思想，使他们认识了不收回贷款就不能扶植冬季生产；并在村里先个别访问几户贷款后的用途，了解了一般生产情况。两天后召开群众大会，结合当时的中心工作（麦征），讲明贷款政策，会后将贷款户留下，让各户谈他们贷款后的用途及作用，启发自愿自觉地还款。接着谈收款精神及办法，有钱还钱，没钱还实物也可以；实物折价一般比市价稍高。群众都说：“还款是应该的，以前救了我们的急，现在又可以拿粮食顶高价挡咱的帐，这都不是便宜咱们吗！”结果到期的款两天就收清了，不到期的款也还了很多。太行黎城用具体算帐、打通群众思想的办法，长畛背等十余个村很快都收回了贷款。反之，有的地方为催贷而催贷，简单地向贷款户宣布收取贷款，并说：“逾期不还，由村干部负责”等。如冀鲁豫昆吾支行在龙场治村催款就是采用了这样的简单方式，结果引起村干反对，群众不还。又如北岳区曲阳县七区有些村因前年灾荒，贷款户又多为新翻身的农民，眼下生活就感困难，贷款数目也较大，马上收回全部贷款，确有困难；而个别干部对这些户的实际困难不去帮助解决，单纯催逼，有一个区干部甚至宣布：“不管什么户，一律得交清，砸锅卖铁也得交。限期十天完成，那村交不了，干部要负一切责任。”沟里村贫农团干部阎林子怕催贷任务不能完成，甚至想上吊自杀。一区东里村贫农胡福来去年七月才贷款买了一条驴。为了还款，又把驴卖了。曲阳其他村子出卖生产资料归还贷款的相当普遍。这说明为催贷而催贷必将引起一些不应有的恶果。这里还提出了一个问题，即对于某些实在无力全部还贷的灾区群众，应有变通办法，或让他们先将利息交清，另办手续，酌情允许展期，而从积极方面组织他们生产来归还农贷。这样才不致违背了贷款为了扶助生产的基本方针。太行黎城谷堆平、九龙山、背坡、小寨等小山庄，共贷新币二万二千五百元，生活很困难，归还不了，他们用组织群众刨药打柴的办法，七天就还清了全部贷款。
    （四）发贷收贷在农村应有专门机构，或专人负责，结合进行。有推进社的地方，最好通过村社办理，一方面扶植了村社业务的开展，一方面也便于检查与收回。村社不健全的村子，如北岳曲阳五区建立了农贷委员会，发放检查与收回都通过它，很方便，所以五区农贷十一月下旬即已收回百分之八十。而冀中肃宁县因贷款与收贷不能结合，贷款干部不管催收，催收又无专人负责，种麦时贷款到期的很多，县社干部只忙于种麦工作，没人去收；等到能去催收时又正赶上秋征，增加了催收的困难。
