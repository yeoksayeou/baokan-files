[Taihang Electric] Li Cheng has concluded its land reform and has now achieved initial completion. The following experiences have been gained in organizational leadership: First, the leadership within the county committee itself is relatively concentrated. This ensures that the county committee is kept informed of the overall situation and experiences in the county, and that it can conduct timely research into policies and instructions. The county committee can also promptly clarify and unify its thinking, and then disseminate instructions or guide the work of the entire county in a timely manner through circulars, quickly correcting the thinking of district and village cadres and ensuring that policies are correctly implemented. Second, attention has been paid to repeatedly inspecting and specifically assisting district committees, especially helping them learn how to review plans, improve the policy and ideological level of cadres, and combining this with in-depth inspections of some villages. This involves providing specific assistance to district cadres in terms of policy implementation and work style. This approach is very important both from the perspective of current work needs and from the perspective of long-term cadre training. As a result, the occurrence of deviations has been reduced; even if they occur, they can be quickly corrected. Third, the various meetings convened by the county committee this year (including county committee meetings) have been better prepared and planned than in the past, using direct communication or raising questions for discussion to guide the work. During this period, because the connections between higher and lower levels were relatively close, the meetings convened to conclude the land reform work did not specifically involve the reporting of situations, thus saving a lot of time. At the same time, the county committee had a largely clear idea in advance of the purpose of each meeting and what problems needed to be solved. Because there was prior preparation, problem solving was generally clearer, and the improvement of district and village cadres was faster and more effective.

The leadership of the district committees has generally improved, playing the role of collective leadership and improving the principles of cadres. Therefore, they not only solve problems and guide work in a timely manner, but also provide better information to the county committee than in the past. Some district leaders have paid attention to personally creating experiences to promote the leadership of the entire district, but there are also individual district leaders whose democratic leadership style is poor, failing to fully utilize the spirit of collective responsibility of the district committee, reducing the effectiveness of the leadership of the entire district.

Secondly, the establishment of work team leadership groups has played a significant role in concluding the land reform work, and through this leadership method, cadres have been trained and improved, making it more effective to directly assist village branches and village cadres. Some work teams not only study work together, but also study organizational life together. This leadership method can still be used and promoted in leading production in the future. However, some teams show undemocratic individualistic practices in leading village cadres, greatly restricting the initiative and leadership role of the branch and the people's congress. The phenomena of individual comrades' freedom, laxity, lack of organization, and lack of discipline have not been completely overcome and should be corrected.

　　黎城领导结束土改工作经验
  　集中领导及时研究　反复检查具体帮助
    【太行电】黎城结束土改现已初步完成，在组织领导上获得如下几点经验：首先，在县委本身的领导上比较集中，这就保证了对全县工作的情况、经验了解的及时，并能及时的研究政策指示工作。县委在思想上也能及时的明确起来统一起来，从而分头传达指示，或以通报的方式及时指导全县工作，迅速端正区村干部思想，使政策得以正确贯彻。其次，注意了反复的进行检查与具体的帮助区委会，特别是帮助其学会审查方案，提高了干部的政策思想水平，并结合深入一部分村的具体检查，从执行政策上与工作作风上，具体的帮助区干部提高。这样做法不论从当前工作需要来说及从长期培养干部出发，都十分重要，因而在工作中减少了偏向的产生；即使产生也能迅速的加以纠正。第三、今年县委召开的各种会议（县委会也在内），比较以往有准备有计划，用直接传达或提出问题经过讨论的方式进行工作指导。这个时期由于上下级联系较密切，所以在结束土改工作上所召开的会议，均未专门进行过情况的汇报，这样会议很节省时间；同时县委预先在思想上也大体明确各个会议的目的及要解决些什么问题，事先有准备所以解决问题一般较明确，对区村干部的提高上较迅速，效果也大。
    在区委会的领导上一般的也较有提高，发挥了集体领导的作用，提高了干部的原则性。所以不但对下解决问题指导工作及时，而对上供给县委情况的了解上也较过去为好。有些区的负责同志注意了亲自创造经验推动全区的领导方法，但也有个别区的负责同志，民主领导的作风差，没有充分发挥了区委会的集体负好精神，使全区工作的领导减少了应有的效果。
    其次工作组领导集团的建立，对结束土改工作起了很大作用，且通过这种领导方式，培养提高了干部，对直接帮助村支部及村干部更为有力。有的工作组不但一齐研究工作，且一齐学习过组织生活，这种领导方法今后在领导生产中仍可运用与发扬，但也有些组对村干部的领导表现不民主个人包办，使支部与人代会的积极性及领导作用大大受了束缚。个别同志的自由散漫与无组织无纪律现象，还未彻底克服，应注意纠正。
