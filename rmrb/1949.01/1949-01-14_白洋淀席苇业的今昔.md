The reed mat is a specialty of Baiyangdian and a major source of livelihood for the local people. There are seventy-one villages in the Dian area that produce reeds. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 65,000 mu of reed fields. The average annual yield of reeds is 12 large bundles per mu (one bundle can weave five Zhang mats), with an annual output of nearly 800,000 large bundles. After deducting one-third for house repairs and firewood, two-thirds are used for weaving mats, which, if fully woven, would yield approximately three million mats.

Before the Anti-Japanese War, reed mats had a wide range of uses and smooth sales channels. However, most of the reed fields were controlled by a small number of feudal landlords. The landlords mostly leased the reed fields to "second landlords," established "mat pot partnerships," hired people to harvest reeds, and sold them at high prices to poor mat weavers. At the same time, they desperately lowered mat prices, leaving mat makers with very little profit. Coupled with the exploitation of high-interest loans and the manipulation of grain prices by speculative grain merchants, this created a poor life for the majority of mat makers, who "wear out their crotches and rub their trousers (referring to weaving mats) but never get rich."

During the Japanese puppet regime after the Anti-Japanese War, puppet organizations such as the "Reed Mat Joint Association" were established one after another, directly led by the Japanese military in Tianjin. It was stipulated that reeds were "military supplies" and private individuals were not allowed to buy or sell them; official prices were set, and forced purchases were carried out. In 1942, after the "May 1st" mopping-up operation, the Japanese puppet regime, in order to protect its Tianjin-Baoding shipping line and facilitate "suppression," cut off more than 30 hectares of reeds in the Xin'an area of the Daqing River (cutting them in May or June would kill them). In addition, because of the enemy's extortion, the masses had no ability to add mud (fertilize) to the reed fields, causing the yield and quality of reeds to decline year after year. Some mat makers, because mats were not worth much, changed the reed fields to grow other crops. Especially in 1943, when enemy disasters were compounded by natural disasters, the reed harvest was poor, and weaving mats was not as good as plowing the land. At that time, to weave mats and transport them to Xin'an, one had to spend money to influence the puppet villages, so one mat could only earn three taels of millet flour. That year, people starved to death in every village during the wheat harvest. More than 140 people starved to death in Zhiduancun alone; in general, small villages starved to death no less than thirty or forty people. Seven people starved to death in Qudi in one day.

After Baiyangdian was liberated by our army in the autumn of 1943, the democratic government specially set up the Longchang Store to specialize in reed mat business, support the people's mat weaving production, and solve livelihood difficulties. On the one hand, it systematically organized the export of mats; on the other hand, it opened up sales channels in the interior. In some villages, mat collection teams were also established, which reduced a lot of trouble for both the mat makers and the store. After Japan surrendered, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, the people of Baiyangdian also successively implemented policies such as rent reduction, liquidation, and land reform, so that most mat makers had reed fields; for those who really did not have reeds, the state-owned store carried out transfers, which also guaranteed the supply of raw materials. In terms of controlling mat prices, according to the statistics for the whole year of last year, each Zhang mat maintained a profit of five jin and ten liang of corn, reaching six to ten jin in peak months (winter and early spring), and around two jin in off-peak months (May and June).

In order to open up mat sales, the state-owned store took out more than 24,800 yuan (new currency), driving private capital equivalent to three times this amount, and jointly operated 14 mat stores. In the whole year of 1946, it completed the purchase of 320,000 mats and the export of 300,000 mats.

However, at that time, only attention was paid to stimulating the increase in production, but the improvement of quality was neglected, which affected the sales of mats. Last year, the state-owned store proposed mat consolidation, and carried out extensive publicity and explanation to the masses in the market and in the countryside. It began to break the masses' wrong idea of cutting corners to get goods quickly, and recognized the purpose of the state-owned store's consolidation. The quality of mats also improved accordingly. At the same time, the store paid attention to consolidating not only improving quality and ensuring size, but also purchasing according to sales conditions, maintaining sales credit, dividing goods according to different uses of mats, and creating brand-name goods. The Hongli branch stipulated that trademarks should be affixed to the mats to promote the creation of brand-name goods.

This year, the Dian area suffered severe floods, and grain production was reduced. Although the reed fields were also reduced by 30% to 40%, weaving mats became the main source of livelihood for the disaster victims. The democratic government paid more attention to vigorously supporting the mat makers. During the lean season, the county production promotion agency and the state-owned Longchang Store transferred 50,379 jin of reeds to supply local mat makers as raw materials. In September and October, the output of mats increased greatly. According to the statistics of seven major markets such as Duancun and Xin'an, more than 900 bundles of mats (30 of the 8-foot mats per bundle, 27 of the 9-foot mats, and 23 of the 12-foot mats) were put on the market every five days; however, due to reasons such as sluggish sales, the output was slightly reduced. After the county production promotion agency actively contacted and sought sales channels from various aspects, and mobilized private individuals to organize transportation and sales, by mid-November, the production and sales of mats became active again. Now there are more than 100,000 people in 124 villages in Anxin County weaving mats, who can mostly or completely rely on weaving mats to solve their livelihood problems. In Datianzhuang, there are 195 households weaving mats, accounting for more than 47% of the total number of households in the village. For example, the mat weaving group of five young girls, such as Mengchun and Mengqin, weave an average of ten mats a day, and one person can earn 30 yuan (new currency). In order to facilitate mass production, this village has also established a supply and marketing cooperative, which in one month transferred 60 shi and 12,000 jin of grain and a boatload of bamboo products to supply to the members; it also promoted the sale of 200 mats, which the members found very convenient. The county production promotion agency is planning to first establish supply and marketing cooperatives in several major mat producing villages such as Laohetou and Guancheng, and promote the overall development through key points, so that the mat industry can be developed more sustainably.

### 白洋淀席苇业的今昔

　　白洋淀席苇业的今昔
    席苇是白洋淀的特产，是当地人民生活的主要来源。淀区共有七十一个村产苇。据不完全的统计，有苇田六万五千亩以上。苇的常年产量，平均每亩能收十二大个（一个能织丈席五领），每年产苇近八十万大个，除去三分之一的修房和烧柴苇以外，三分之二的织席苇，如完全织成席，约织三百万领上下。
    抗战以前，席的用途很广，销路也畅通；可是苇地大部分掌握在少数的封建地主手里，地主多把苇田出租给“二东家”，成立“席锅伙”，雇人打苇，高价卖给贫苦的织席户；同时，还拼命压低席价，使席民得利很小；再加上高利贷的剥削，和投机粮贩的操纵粮价，这就造成了广大席民“擦裆磨裤（指织席）至死不富”的穷困生活。
    抗战以后，日伪统治时期，先后建立了“席苇联合会”等伪组织，直接受天津日寇军部领导，决定苇子为“军用品”，私人不得买卖；规定官价，强行征购。民国三十一年“五一”扫荡后，日伪为了保护它的津保航线，便于“清剿”，割掉了大清河新安境苇子三十多顷（五、六月间割了就死）。另外，因为敌人的敲榨勒索，群众也没力对苇地加泥（施肥），使苇子的产量和成色一年年的下降。有些席民，因为席不值钱，把苇地改种别的庄稼。特别在民国三十二年，敌祸加天灾，苇子歉收，织席还不如刨地梨。当时，织出席来运到新安去，还得花钱运动伪大乡，所以一领席只能赚三两多小米面。这年麦收时，各村普遍饿死人。只端村就饿死了一百四十多个；一般小村饿死也不下三几十个。曲堤一天就饿死了七个。
    民国三十二年秋，白洋淀被我军解放以后，民主政府特设隆昌商店，专门经营席苇业务，扶植人民的织席生产，解决生活困难。一面有计划的组织席子出口；一面又打开内地销路。在部分村庄还建立了收席小组，这样席民和商店都减少好多麻烦。日本投降后，白洋淀的人民在共产党和民主政府领导下，也先后实行了减租、清算、土改等政策，使大部席民有了苇地；实在没有苇的，公营商店进行了调运，也保证了原料的供给。在掌握席价上，据去年全年的统计，每领丈席保持为五斤十两玉米的利润，在旺月（冬季和春初）达六至十斤，背月（五、六月）在二斤上下。
    为了打开席子的销路，公营商店拿出了二万四千八百多元（新币），带动了相当于此数三倍的私资，合营了十四个席店，在民国三十五年全年，完成了三十二万领席子的收买，和三十万领席子的出口。
    可是，当时只注重了刺激产品的增多，却忽略了质量的提高，以致影响到席子的推销。去年公营商店提出席子整庄，在集上和乡村广泛的向群众进行宣传解释，开始打破了群众见货快就偷工减料的错误思想，认清了公营商店整庄的目的，席子的质量就随着提高了。同时，商店按席子用途的不同，在整庄上注意了不单是提高质量保证尺寸，而且根据销售情形进行收买，保持销售信用，划分货色，创造牌子货。宏利分店曾规定在席子上贴商标，发扬创牌货。
    今年淀区水灾严重，粮食减收，苇田虽也减收百分之三十至四十，但以织席生产，成了灾民的主要生活依靠。民主政府更加注意了对席民的大力扶植，在青黄不接的时候，县生产推进社和公营隆昌商店，调运了苇子五万零三百七十九斤，供给当地席民作原料。九、十月份，席的产量大增，据端村、新安等七个主要集市的统计，每五天共上席九百多捆（八尺的每捆三十领，九尺的二十七领，丈二的二十三领）；可是因为销路不畅等原因，受些影响，产量稍减。经过县生产推进社从多方面联系，积极找销路，并发动私人组织运销，到十一月中旬，席的产销又显活跃。现在安新全县有一百二十四个村庄十万以上的人织席，能大部或全部靠织席解决生活问题。大田庄有一百九十五户织席的，占全村户数的百分之四十七强。如孟春、孟琴等五个小闺女的织席组，一天平均织席十领，一个人能赚三十元（新币）。这村为便利群众生产，还建立了供销合作社，一个月的工夫，调运了粮食六十石又一万二千斤，和一船竹货，供给了社员用；还推销了二百领席，社员感到很方便。县生产推进社，正计划先在老河头，关城等几个产席的主要村庄，建立起供销合作社，通过重点，推动全盘、使席业更得到长远的发展。
