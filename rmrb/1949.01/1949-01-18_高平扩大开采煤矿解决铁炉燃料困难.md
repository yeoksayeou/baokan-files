(Taiyue Telegraph) The development of the iron industry in Gaoping has encountered difficulties, and it is urgent to solve the problem of coal mine raw materials. Since the winter production deployment in the county, various iron furnaces such as square furnaces, freight furnaces, strip furnaces, and burning furnaces have greatly developed in more than a month, increasing from the original 132 to 222. However, due to the failure to properly organize the mining of coal and iron ore, the iron furnaces lack coal raw materials. For example, the Fourth District increased 13 iron furnaces, but the Guanzhenggou coal kiln could not supply enough. The four coal kilns in the Jianning Joint Defense Zone of the Fifth District produce 36,470 catties of coal per day, which is not enough to supply the needs of 102 iron furnaces. According to a survey, each furnace must use 58,800 catties of coal per day, and the coal production is far from sufficient. Three strip furnaces in Beishe Village in the Fifth District have already stopped working; the iron furnaces in Yegou Village and Fenghuma in the Fourth District produce less than 100 catties of iron per furnace, which has reduced production and resulted in losses. This problem has attracted the attention of the government. For the pumping problem that is difficult to solve in each coal kiln, a water pump is now being trial-manufactured in a certain factory; and a meeting of managers of various coal kilns is held to formulate a production increase plan, and efforts are made to increase workers; those who need loans are given loan support. At the same time, the masses are mobilized to invest labor as shares and work in the kiln. It is also planned to build the coal mining road from Qincheng to Tang'an to facilitate transportation. As for the iron ore problem, the iron furnaces in Dongjiashan area of the Third District of Gaoping have always relied on the Waiyang mining industry of Jincheng to supply iron ore, but due to lack of raw materials, some local kilns are afraid that the Gaoping iron furnaces will come to buy ore, and have planned not to allow iron ore to leave the village. This problem urgently needs to be resolved reasonably so that the iron industry can develop in a balanced manner.

　　高平扩大开采煤矿解决铁炉燃料困难
    【太岳电】高平铁业发展遇到困难，急需解决煤矿原料问题。该县自冬季生产布置后，全县方炉、货炉、条炉、烧炉等各种铁炉，一个多月来有很大发展，已由原来的一百三十二座发展到二百二十二座。但因没有很好组织煤炭和铁矿的开采，致铁炉缺乏煤炭原料，如四区增加了十三座铁炉，官正沟煤窑供应不上。五区建宁联防区四处煤窑，每日产炭三万六千四百七十斤，不够供给一百零两座铁炉的需用。据调查各炉每天必须用炭五万八千八百斤，煤的产量大大供给不上。五区北社村已有三座条炉停工；四区野沟村、冯胡马的铁炉，每炉出铁不到一百斤，已降低产量，发生赔本情形。这问题已引起政府注意，对于各煤窑所难解决的抽水问题，现正在某工厂试造抽水机；并召开各煤窑经理会议，制订增产计划，设法增加工人；对需要贷款的给以贷款扶植。同时又动员群众以劳力入股，上窑做活。并计划兴修秦城到唐安的采煤路，以便利运输。至铁矿问题，高平三区东甲山一带铁炉，一向依靠晋城外阳矿务供给铁矿，但因缺乏原料，当地有些铁垆怕高平铁炉来买矿，已计划不让铁矿出村，此种问题急需合理解决，使铁业得以平衡发展。
