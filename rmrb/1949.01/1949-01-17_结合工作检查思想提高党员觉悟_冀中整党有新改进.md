Jizhong Electric: At present, the democratic party rectification in various counties and districts has started in key villages one after another. In the eighth district, work has begun in 99 key villages in eight counties. In the ninth district, 2,251 villages need to complete land reform, and work has started in 251 villages. Most of the work starts with ending land reform and consolidating war efforts, and the party rectification work has been greatly improved. Generally, key villages can start from investigation and research to understand the situation, seek truth from facts, and proceed from the urgent requirements of the masses and party members. Some also understand how to look at problems from a class analysis perspective and proceed cautiously.

The following four main experiences have been gained in the party rectification in key villages in various places: First, the spirit of this year's party rectification must be explained openly and patiently to break the doubts and concerns of party members. Before explaining the party rectification policy, most party members showed suspicion and fear and were unwilling to rectify. After understanding the party rectification policy, most party members showed happiness and were willing to rectify again to clarify the situation. Second, after initially breaking the ideological concerns of party members, it is necessary to further invigorate the working enthusiasm of party members, grasp the main links of the work, and get the work done. Understand the ideological situation of party members from the movement, and gradually improve awareness through work review, instead of rectifying the party as soon as you intervene. The ways to invigorate the work enthusiasm of party members are: Raoyang Beishan Key Village summarized the work history of the branch and praised the heroic and tragic deeds of party members in the struggle against the enemy in the past; individual talks were conducted with party members with serious ideological problems to untie the knots in their hearts. During the party rectification in Hejian × Village, representatives of the masses were invited to participate. In the beginning, only shortcomings were raised, forming questions, and as a result, the emotions of party members and the masses were low. Later, after deliberation and preparation, a commendation meeting was held, and representatives of the masses commented on the branch's protection of the interests of the masses, adherence to work in a cruel environment, and leadership of the masses in turning over in the struggle against the enemy. Some of the masses were moved to tears. The party members all felt the glory of the title of Communist Party member, and each branch committee made a deeper review. After such a commendation meeting, the unity between the party and the masses was achieved, and the prestige of the party was improved. Fourteen people requested to join the party, which greatly invigorated the emotions of party members. Therefore, commendation and demerit must be combined. (Editor's note: Open party rectification should emphasize self-criticism for party members. Party members should not take credit in front of the masses at any time. The masses will naturally recognize contributions. Do not mobilize the masses to hold commendation meetings specifically for party member cadres.) Third, the entire process of party rectification should be a process of gradual improvement of awareness, ideological transformation, and reform of party members; the process of inviting representatives of the masses to assist in party rectification should be a process of gradually breaking the concerns of the masses and bringing the masses closer to the party. The law of ideological change of party members in party rectification is: from suspicion and worry about party rectification to being perfunctory, evasive, saying strange things, complaining, wanting to retaliate, and then turning to paying attention to party rectification but fearing to expose shortcomings, and finally realizing the glory of the title of party member, and seriously and deeply reviewing. The law of ideological change of the masses in party rectification is: from not caring about party rectification to wanting to make suggestions but having concerns, to making a few suggestions first, and then realizing that the party and themselves are one family, making suggestions with the same heart as the party, and making suggestions wholeheartedly and kindly. This is a complex process of change, and it is necessary to patiently ponder and solve ideological problems. The signs that party members have cleared their minds are: happy spirits, deep review, and enthusiastic work. The signs that the masses have cleared their minds are: making suggestions wholeheartedly and kindly, approaching the party, and realizing that the Communist Party is truly doing things for the masses; therefore, they cherish the party even more. Fourth, party rectification must grasp the requirements of the broad masses and their enthusiastic assistance, and also grasp the requirements of the majority of party members and mobilize them to actively participate. The two are consistent. All kinds of work can be combined with party rectification. Party rectification must be carried out in the movement through a certain kind of work. Avoid closing the door to rectify thoughts.

It is necessary to pay attention to overcoming the disconnection between party rectification and the end of land reform in some villages.

In the party rectification in various places, there are still the following problems: (1) In terms of guiding ideology: The close combination of party rectification and the end of land reform has not been fully understood, resulting in a more serious phenomenon of disconnection. Some key villages believe that the land has been distributed and the wrongly struggled middle peasants have been compensated when analyzing the situation in the village, so there is no content to end the land reform; the distribution of houses and the issuance of land certificates are left outside the end of land reform. Some key villages have been working for half a month to twenty days, but the work of ending land reform has not progressed, or progress is very slow. Some have a great enthusiasm for adjusting organizations, but less enthusiasm for solving problems ideologically, thinking that village cadres can do the work, and restricting party rectification to a very narrow circle. Many counties believe that the party rectification is completed after the land certificates are issued, and they do not pay enough attention to how to strengthen the proletarian ideology of party members, overcome various non-proletarian ideologies, and the long-term nature of party rectification. (2) In terms of working methods: Although all places have paid attention to investigation and research, they mostly circle around party members and cadres and do not go deep into the masses; they mostly use meetings to ask party members and the masses for their opinions; they are not good at individually digging into problems; they only simply ask the masses who is good and who is bad, and what opinions they have, and are not good at combining with explanation and education, so that the masses are confused, have concerns, and dare not speak, and even have misconceptions about the party. Furthermore, a large pile of materials is investigated, but the main problems are not grasped to start solving them, forming an investigation for the sake of investigation, and stopping at simply understanding the situation; problems are not solved in promoting the work, but are hindered by the solution of some trivial problems, so that the work cannot be promoted. Some county committees have been conducting key villages for half a month and are still understanding the situation. Furthermore, there is the "single-handed" working method: not being good at combining various tasks. Some do not publicize the party rectification policy and the policy of ending land reform to party members and the masses, but just bury their heads in doing work, which causes suspicion among the masses and party members. (3) In terms of work arrangements: Most counties have determined to complete it in three or four batches, and individual districts have even determined to complete it in five batches. The time for each batch is generally determined to be 20 to 25 days, and individual batches are determined to be 15 days; but now it has been 20 days, and by the end of January, there will only be two months of work left (this is a summary at the end of November). Based on this calculation, it is difficult to complete. Generally, for a village, if the content of the work is to correct policies, distribute houses, issue land certificates, and initially solve the ideological problems of party members, it will take at least 30 to 40 days. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the number of working days in each village, reduce the number of batches, and expand the scope of development in order to complete the task on schedule. In terms of the use of cadre forces, Xinle initially invested only 99 people, and some counties invested only 50 to 60 people, which is far from the number during the land reform last year, and the strength must be increased again.

### 结合工作检查思想提高党员觉悟　冀中整党有新改进

　　结合工作检查思想提高党员觉悟
  　冀中整党有新改进
    【冀中电】目前各县区的民主整党，重点村已经先后开始。八分区八个县重点村开始工作者九十九村。九分区须结束土改者二千二百五十一村，开始工作者二百五十一村。多数是通过结束土改、整顿战勤着手整党，整党工作有很大改进。一般重点村都能做到从调查研究了解情况着手，实事求是，根据群众和党员的迫切要求出发，还有的懂得了从阶级分析上看问题，慎重进行工作。
    在各地重点村整党中获得四项主要经验：一、必须公开耐心讲解今年整党的精神，以打破党员的怀疑顾虑。在未解释整党方针以前，一般党员都表现怀疑、惧怕，不愿整党，在了解了整党方针后，多数的党员都表现愉快，愿意再整一整，为的弄个青红皂白。二、初步打破党员思想顾虑后，要进一步振奋党员工作情绪，抓住工作主要环节，把工作搞起来。从运动中了解党员的思想情况，通过工作检讨思想，逐步提高觉悟，不要一插手就整党。振奋党员工作热情的办法：饶阳北善重点村是综述支部的工作历史，表扬过去党员在对敌斗争中英勇壮烈的事迹；对思想上问题严重的党员，进行个别谈话，解开心内的扣子。河间×庄整党中，邀请群众代表参加，开始光提缺点，形成质问，结果党员群众情绪都低落；后来经过酝酿准备，开评功大会，由群众代表评述支部在对敌斗争中保护群众利益、坚持残酷环境工作，及领导群众翻身的事情，有的群众被感动的哭起来。党员们都感到共产党称号的光荣，各支委都做了较深刻的检讨。经过这样评功大会后，达到了党与群众的团结，提高了党的威信，有十四个群众要求加入党，大大振奋了党员的情绪。所以评功论过必须结合起来。（编者按：公开整党，对于党员应强调自我批评，党员在群众面前任何时候均不应居功，有功群众自然会承认的，不要发动群众专为党员干部开评功大会。）三、整个整党的过程，应是党员逐步提高觉悟思想转变改造的过程；邀请群众代表协助整党的过程，应是逐步打破群众顾虑，使群众向党靠近的过程。整党中党员思想变化的规律是：由对整党怀疑顾虑到马马虎虎，支应搪塞，到说怪话，发牢骚，想报复，以后转到重视整党又害怕暴露缺点，最后到认识党员称号的光荣，认真深刻的检讨。群众在整党中思想变化的规律是：由不关心整党到想提意见又有顾虑，到先少提点，以后认识了党和自己是一家人，提意见是和党一个心，尽情的善意的提意见。这是一个复杂变化的过程，必须耐心捉摸，解决思想问题。党员搞通思想的标志是：精神愉快、深刻检讨和热情工作。群众搞通思想的标志是：尽情善意的提出意见，向党靠近，认识共产党是真正给群众办事情；因而对党更加爱护。四、整党必须抓住广大群众的要求和热心协助，又必须抓住多数党员的要求，发动其积极参加，两者是一致的。各种工作都可与整党相结合，必须通过某一种工作，在运动中进行整党，切忌关着门子整思想。
    有些村整党与结束土改脱节急须注意克服
    各地整党中，也还存有以下几个问题：（一）领导思想上：对整党与结束土改的密切结合还没有完全搞通，以致脱节现象较为严重。有的重点村在分析村中情况时，认为土地已经分好，错斗了的中农已经补偿，便没有结束土改的内容了；把分房子和发土地证丢在结束土改之外。有的重点村作了半月廿天，而结束土改工作还没有进展，或进展很慢。有的调整组织的劲头大，从思想上解决问题的劲小，以为村干部能做工作就行，把整党限制在极为狭小的圈子里。不少县份认为发完土地证，整党也就完成了，对如何加强党员的无产阶级思想，克服各种非无产阶级思想，和整党的长期性注意不够。（二）在工作方法上：各地虽都注意了调查研究，但多是在党员干部中打圈子，没有深入到群众中去；多是用开会方式叫党员、群众提意见；不善于个别的深入发掘问题；只会简单的问群众谁好谁不好，有什么意见，不善于和解释教育相结合，以致群众莫明其妙，有顾虑不敢说，甚至对党的认识发生错觉。再就是调查了材料一大摊，抓不住主要问题着手解决，形成为调查而调查，停止在单纯了解情况上；不是在推动工作前进中解决问题，而是在一些琐碎问题的解决上拌住了脚，以致工作推不动，有些县委掌握的重点村，进行了半个月，还在了解情况。再就是“单打一”的工作方法：不善于把各项工作结合进行。有的不向党员群众宣传整党的方针和结束土改的政策，光闷着头做工作，以致引起群众党员的怀疑。（三）在工作布置上：各县多确定分三番或四番完成，个别区还确定了五番完成。每番的时间一般确定二十天到二十五天，个别的确定十五天；但现在已过二十天，到一月底不过还做两个月的工作（此为十一月底总结），依此推算，是难以完成的。一般的村，如果工作内容是端正政策、分房子、发土地证、初步解决党员思想，至少也要三十天到四十天。因此就必须增长每个村的工作天数，减少番数，扩大开展面，才能按期完成任务。在干部力量使用上，新乐初期仅投入九十九人，还有的县仅投入五六十人，比去年土改时相差甚远，必须再增加力量。
