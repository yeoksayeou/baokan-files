Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. U.S. imperialism is uniting with British, French, and other reactionaries in a plot to organize a new anti-communist and anti-people bloc in Southeast Asia. On the one hand, the U.S. government is directing the Nehru government of India to organize a "Southeast Asian Group of Nations" under imperialist leadership; on the other hand, it is instigating Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries to organize an imperialist "Far East Military Group" directly participated in by owners of Eastern colonies.

Since Nehru successively sent out invitations in early January to convene a so-called "Asian Conference," the invitees Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Nepal, the Kuomintang government of China, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, and the Philippines have accepted the invitations and appointed official representatives or "observers" to attend the so-called "Asian Conference" held in New Delhi on January 20. Nehru announced that the conference would discuss the Dutch aggression against Indonesia, but all parties have confirmed that the main purpose of the conference is to exchange views with the aforementioned countries on the organization of an anti-communist and anti-people "Southeast Asian Group." According to a United Press dispatch on the 4th, "The conference convened by Nehru may lead to the formation of a new political bloc in an already divided world." A dispatch from Washington on the 5th even more bluntly stated: "Both here (referring to the United States) and India want to make the establishment of a Southeast Asian Group possible." Philippine President Quirino, a loyal running dog of the American reactionaries, included "organizing Eastern countries into a group" in the tasks given to Romulo, the Philippine representative to the "New Delhi Conference" on the 15th (United Press). The convening of this conference was clearly instigated by the United States. Before the Indian government decided to convene this conference, Indian Ambassador to the United States Asaf Ali held secret talks with former U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett on December 20 last year. After the news of the conference was officially announced, American reactionary public opinion mostly gave it enthusiastic support.

Simultaneous with the preparations for the "New Delhi Conference," British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently held a series of meetings with French Foreign Minister Schuman and representatives of British Dominions such as India, Australia, and New Zealand in London to discuss military cooperation in suppressing the people of Southeast Asian colonies. The British-French joint communique published in London on the 14th openly emphasized that British-French cooperation in Europe "will be extended to the East." An Associated Press dispatch from London on the 16th quoted so-called "reliable sources" as revealing that after concluding the North Atlantic anti-People Pact, the next action of the reactionary representatives of various imperialist countries may be to conclude a "Far East Defense Treaty" "to deal with the expansion of the communists in the Far East." An Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 15th also quoted so-called "well-informed" sources in Canada as saying: "Plans to conclude a Pacific treaty are being studied, and the countries participating in the treaty will include: the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Australia, India, New Zealand, and China (referring to the Kuomintang government), etc." An Associated Press dispatch on the 16th also said: The policy of concluding a Far East military treaty has been confirmed by Bevin's recent statement in the House of Commons.

The imperialists' plot to organize a Southeast Asian anti-people military group has been brewing for a long time. As early as June last year, the United States convened a meeting of senior officials stationed in Southeast Asian countries in Bangkok. Last autumn, the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference also discussed the issue of Pacific joint defense. In November last year, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, also convened a meeting of British envoys stationed in Southeast Asian countries in Singapore. After the meeting, MacDonald, together with British Far East Commander Li Qi, went to Bangkok and signed a "anti-communist" secret agreement with Siamese fascist headman Luang Phibunsongkhram. Li Qi also ran to Saigon in early December last year and held talks with the French colonial authorities in Vietnam. Subsequently, there were frequent exchanges of envoys between the French authorities in Vietnam and Britain and Siam. In late December of the same month, Mook, one of the Dutch reactionary chieftains, and Dutch Admiral Helfrich openly shouted for the establishment of a "Southeast Asian Military Group" with the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands as "leaders."

The reason why the United States and other reactionaries are stepping up the organization of anti-revolutionary groups in Southeast Asia is a desperate struggle of panic in the face of the rising tide of national democratic movements in Asia. The New Year's Day editorial of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the mouthpiece of the American big bourgeoisie, exclaimed in alarm that Asia, the sleeping tiger, "has now awakened," and admitted that the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has "thwarted Washington's plans." In this situation, the editorial anxiously demanded that "methods to deal with it should be sought," and believed that "a way out can be found through India." British Foreign Secretary Bevin also feared during the British-French talks "the advance of the communists in Asia." But no matter what conspiracies and tricks the imperialists adopt, or what kind of anti-revolutionary groups they organize, they will not be able to stop the development of the Asian people's revolutionary movement.

　　美帝正联合英法等国反动派
  　策动东南亚反人民集团
    图在亚洲革命高潮面前进行绝望挣扎
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】美帝国主义正联合英法等国反动派，进行在东南亚组织新的反共反人民集团的阴谋。美国政府一方面指使印度尼赫鲁政府筹组在帝国主义领导下的“东南亚各国集团”；另方面则策动英法荷等国，组织由东方殖民地拥有者直接参加的帝国主义“远东军事集团”。
    自尼赫鲁于一月上旬先后发出召开所谓“亚洲会议”的请柬后，被邀的巴基斯坦、锡兰、缅甸、尼泊尔、中国的国民党政府、阿富汗、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、伊拉克和菲律宾等，已应邀委派正式代表或“观察员”，出席一月二十日在新德里举行的所谓“亚洲会议”。尼赫鲁宣布会议将是讨论荷兰侵略印尼问题，但各方证实：会议之主要目的，在于就组织反共反人民的“东南亚集团”一事，与上述各国交换意见。据合众社四日电透露：“尼赫鲁所召集的会议，可能引导在业已分裂的世界上组成一新政治集团。”该社华盛顿五日电更露骨地称：“此间（指美国）及印度均欲使东南亚集团有成立之可能。”美国反动派的忠实走狗菲总统季里诺，十五日在交给菲出席“新德里会议”代表罗慕洛的任务中，包括“组织东方国家成为集团”（合众社）。这次会议的召集，显系美国所指使。当印度政府决定召开此次会议以前，印驻美大使阿萨夫阿里曾于去年十二月二十日与美前代理国务卿罗维特举行过密谈。而在召开会议的消息正式公布后，美国反动舆论多予以热烈支持。
    与“新德里会议”的筹集同时，英外相贝文曾在最近与法外长舒曼及印度、澳洲、新西兰等英自治领驻英代表举行一系列的会议，讨论在反对东南亚殖民地人民中的军事合作问题。十四日伦敦发表的英法会谈公报，公开强调：英法在欧洲的合作，“将扩充到东方”。美联社伦敦十六日电引所谓“可靠方面”消息，透露各帝国主义国家的反动代表，继订立北大西洋反人民公约后，下一行动可能是订立“远东防务条约”，“以对付共产党在远东的扩张”。法新社十五日电亦引加拿大所谓“消息灵通”人士的话说：“订立太平洋条约的计划正在研究中，参加该约的国家将有：美、英、法、荷、澳、印、新西兰及中国（指国民党政府）等”。美联社十六日电又说：缔订远东军事条约的政策，已为贝文最近在下院的声明所确定。
    帝国主义者筹组东南亚反人民军事集团的阴谋，酝酿已久。早在去年六月，美国即在曼谷召开了驻东南亚各国高级官员的会议。去秋，英联邦总理会议亦曾讨论太平洋联防问题。去年十一月，英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳，在新加坡亦召开了英国驻东南亚各国使节的会议。会后，麦氏曾偕英远东军司令李琪赴曼谷，与暹罗法西斯头子銮披汶订立了“反共”密约。李琪又于去年十二月上旬跑到西贡，与法国驻越南殖民当局有所商谈。其后，越南法国当局与英暹之间，复有使节往返。同月下旬，荷兰反动头子之一穆克及荷海军上将基尔弗立契即公开喊出了：建立以美英法荷为“领导”的“东南亚各国军事集团”。
    美国等反动派之所以加紧筹组东南亚的反革命集团乃是它们在亚洲民族民主运动高潮面前吓慌了的一种绝望挣扎。美国大资产阶级喉舌克里夫兰公论报元旦社论惊呼：亚洲这只睡眠状态中的老虎“现已觉醒”，并承认中国人民解放军的伟大胜利，使“华盛顿的计划受到挫折”。在这种情况下，社论慌张地要求“应找寻应付的方法”，而认为“通过印度可以找到一条出路”。英外长贝文在英法会谈时也惊惧“共产党在亚洲前进。”但不管帝国主义者采取什么阴谋诡计，组织任何样式的反革命集团，将都无法阻止亚洲人民革命运动的发展。
