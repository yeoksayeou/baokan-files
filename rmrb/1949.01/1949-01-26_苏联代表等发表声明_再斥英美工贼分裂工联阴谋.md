Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 24th: TASS, Paris, January 20th: The Soviet delegation attending the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Executive Bureau meeting and WFTU General Secretary Saillant simultaneously issued statements at a press conference, harshly criticizing the proposal by the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) General Council that the WFTU should temporarily suspend its activities. The Soviet delegation's statement said that, as expressed in the recent statements by Deakin, Gallie, and Kupers, the purpose of the aforementioned proposal is not to temporarily suspend the WFTU's activities, but to abolish the WFTU. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the British TUC and the American CIO's arguments regarding the WFTU's attitude towards the Marshall Plan are groundless. This argument stubbornly insists that the Soviet trade unions obstructed the discussion of the Marshall Plan in the WFTU. In fact, it was the Soviet Union that suggested discussing the Marshall Plan democratically within the WFTU Executive Committee, the most representative body. Conversely, it was the leaders of the British TUC and the American CIO who refused to discuss the Marshall Plan within the WFTU's framework, preferring to take a different path. They disregarded the WFTU and separately convened a meeting of trade unions from sixteen countries. The statement forcefully asserted that the unity of the working class is the main weapon in its struggle for peace and to improve the living conditions of the working masses. The majority committee of the Executive Bureau made every effort to maintain the unity of the WFTU, but the representatives of the British TUC and the American CIO resolutely refused to cooperate with the WFTU. Therefore, they bear full responsibility for the split. Nevertheless, the Executive Bureau still leaves the door open and agrees to resume cooperation with the British TUC and the American CIO at any time. The statement concluded: After the representatives of the British TUC and the American CIO leave, the WFTU will continue to exist. It must more steadfastly carry out the struggle to improve workers' living standards, guarantee democratic freedoms, and strive for lasting international peace. The Soviet delegation is confident that the WFTU Executive Committee and the subsequent WFTU Council and Congress will support the further development and consolidation of the WFTU.
　　
World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant's statement pointed out that the British TUC General Council's proposal reflects the influence of those who have been planning to split the trade union movements of certain countries and the world trade union movement for more than a year. They have tried their best to divide the unity of the WFTU, ignored the completely understandable and reasonable arguments put forward by the majority of the Executive Bureau members, and seceded from this organization. Saillant declared that since the Executive Bureau is the agency authorized to guarantee the activities of the WFTU, we cannot allow two or three trade union organizations to use undemocratic methods to stop the work of the WFTU, because this violates the will of the sixty-seven trade union organizations from various countries that participate in the WFTU.

　　苏联代表等发表声明
  　再斥英美工贼分裂工联阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社巴黎二十日讯：出席世界工联执行局会议的苏联代表团及世界工联总书记赛扬，顷于记者招待会上同时发表声明，严厉批评英国职工大会常委会关于世界工联应暂时停止活动的建议。苏联代表团的声明称：象狄金、加莱，库伯斯三人最近的声明所表示的，上述建议的目的，不在于暂时停止世界工联的活动，而在于取消世界工联。苏联代表团指出：英国职工大会及美国产联关于世界工联对马歇尔计划的态度的论调毫无根据。这一论调硬说苏联职工会曾阻挠马歇尔计划在世界工联中的讨论。但是，在事实上，建议以民主方式在世界工联执委会这个最有代表性的机构中讨论马歇尔计划的正是苏联，相反，倒是英国职工大会及美国产联的领袖们，拒绝在世界工联的机构内讨论马歇尔计划，而宁愿采取别的道路。他们漠视世界工联，曾单独召开了十六个国家职工会的会议。声明力称：工人阶级队伍的统一，是工人阶级在其争取和平、争取改善劳动大众生活条件的斗争中的主要武器。执行局多数委员会竭尽一切努力以求保持世界工联的统一，但是，英国职工大会与美国产联代表却断然拒绝与工联合作。因此，它们应对分裂负全部责任。虽然如此，执行局还开启着大门，并且同意随时与英国职工大会及美国产联恢复合作。声明末称：在英国职工大会与美国产联代表将来离开之后，世界工联将继续存在下去。它必须更加坚定不渝地进行提高工人生活水平、保证民主自由、争取国际持久和平的斗争。苏联代表团确信：世界工联执委会和随后将要召开的工联理事会与代表大会，将赞成世界工联的进一步的开展与巩固。
    世界工联总书记赛扬的声明指出：英国职工大会常委会的提案，反映了一年多来计划分裂某些国家的职工运动并分裂世界职工运动的那些人的影响。他们竭力分裂世界工联的统一，对执行局多数委员所提出的完全可以理解的与合理的论点置之不顾，并脱离这一组织。塞扬宣称：执行局既然是受权保证世界工联之活动的机构，我们就不能允许两三个职工会组织用非民主的方法来停止世界工联的工作，因为这是违背参加世界工联各国六十七个职工组织的意志的。
