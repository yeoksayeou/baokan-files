One Versus One Hundred and Twenty

On the evening of December 23rd, in the mountains north of Zhangjiakou, 50,000 fleeing bandits were surrounded and defeated by us. Soldiers of the "Steadfast" unit were scattered throughout the ravines, capturing fleeing bandits everywhere. Hu Runren, a young communications soldier from the 6th Company of this unit, went to the battalion headquarters to deliver a message and mistakenly walked into a group of fleeing bandits. This group of enemies numbered more than three hundred, led by their regimental commander, and were running around in a panic. The enemy regimental commander wanted to find out some information about breaking through and escaping from the young communications soldier, but the answer he received was: "We have tens of thousands of people. Didn't you hear the gunshots? You can't escape anywhere. Sooner or later, you will become our prisoners." The enemy asked him to lead them in a breakout, and Comrade Xiao Hu pointed to the position of his company and said: "You can break through from here." The enemy then ran. After running only two or three li, several dark figures suddenly shouted, "Surrender! Old folks!" The enemy regimental commander hurriedly mixed into the ranks of the soldiers, and some enemies turned back to flee, while others lay on the side. Comrade Hu, recognizing that the comrades shouting slogans in front were his own, cleverly shouted to the fleeing enemies: "Give me your guns!" He readily grabbed a gun, loaded it, and shouted loudly, "Don't move! Anyone who moves will be shot!" Several enemies who wanted to run were frightened by his shot, and more than one hundred and twenty enemies surrendered to this young hero of the People's Liberation Army. He escorted more than one hundred and twenty prisoners back to the unit alone.

　　一个和一百廿个
    十二月二十三日晚在张家口北面的大山中，五万逃匪被我们包围打垮，“坚强”部的战士撒满山沟，遍地捕捉逃匪。该部六连小通讯员胡润仁去营部送信，误走入逃匪群中，被匪捉住了。这股敌人有三百多，由团长带领着正在乱跑，敌团长想从小通讯员口中找到些突围逃跑的情况，但他得到的回答是：“我们有好几万人，你没听见响枪，哪也跑不出去。迟早要当我们的俘虏。”敌人叫他带着突围，小胡同志指着本连阵地说：从这能突出去。敌人就跑起来，刚跑了二三里，前面突然有几个黑影喊着：“缴枪吧！老乡。”敌团长慌忙混到士兵里去，敌人有的回头挑跑，有的卧在一边。胡同志看准前面喊口号的是自己的同志，便机警的对正在逃跑的敌人喊：“把枪交给我。”顺手夺过一支枪来推上子弹高声叫道：“不要动，谁动枪决谁！”几个想跑的敌人被他一枪吓住，一百二十多个敌人向这个解放军的小英雄请降。他一个人押着一百二十多俘虏走回部队。
