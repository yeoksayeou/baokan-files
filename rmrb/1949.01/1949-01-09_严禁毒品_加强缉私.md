　　Strictly Prohibit Drugs
  　Strengthen Anti-Smuggling
    Since the Qinyang County Public Security Bureau strengthened public security work and strictly prohibited drug smuggling, it has cracked seven opium cases in just seven or eight days, seizing 92.9 taels of opium, eleven silver dollars, and 1,691,500 yuan in drug money. Drug dealers claimed: Opium smuggling is rampant. A drug dealer from Henan sold 200 taels of opium in Qinyang in one day. A drug dealer from south of the Yellow River came to Qinyang with five taels of gold and six million yuan in silver to buy opium. This shows how serious drug smuggling is. Most of this opium was trafficked from the newly recovered areas of Yuci and Taiyuan in Shanxi. It is hoped that Yuci and Taiyuan counties will be highly vigilant and conduct inspections on this issue. Other regions should also pay attention.

　　严禁毒品
  　加强缉私
    沁阳县公安局自加强治安工作和严禁毒品缉私后，仅仅七、八天时间就破获烟土案七案，查获烟土九十二两九钱，银洋十一元，贩毒品款一百六十九万一千五百元。烟犯自称：烟土走私甚凶，河南一个烟贩携带二百两烟土到沁阳一天就出卖完了。黄河南一个烟贩带有五两金子、六百万元大洋来沁阳买烟上，可见毒品走私是如何严重。这些烟土，大都是从山西榆次、太谷新收复区贩来的。望榆次、太谷县对此问题高度警惕和检查。其他各地亦应注意。
