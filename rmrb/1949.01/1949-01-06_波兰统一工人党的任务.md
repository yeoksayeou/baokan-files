　　The Tasks of the Polish United Workers' Party
    (The final part of the report by Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, at the Polish United Workers' Party Congress on December 15, 1948)
    In the short period since the establishment of People's Democratic Poland, the following achievements have been made: First, the guarantee of the Republic's independence and the stability of its borders; Second, the rapid recovery of the country from the devastation of the war, the rapid industrialization of the country, and the expansion of the economic potential of the socialized sector; Third, the reunion with the Western Territories and their development; Fourth, the elimination of unemployment, the continuous improvement of the material conditions of the workers, the provision of broad opportunities for the progress of the public, and the increasing participation of the working people in state administration; Fifth, the situation of the land shortage of the peasant masses has been greatly reduced and their living conditions have improved; Sixth, the development of education at all levels, providing the broadest masses with opportunities for education and access to culture; Seventh, the improvement of the situation of working women; Eighth, the provision of extensive work and study opportunities for working-class and peasant youth.
    Relying on these achievements, and above all on the unity of the working people—which is manifested in the political unity of the working class—the united party has defined as its great historical task the launching of a comprehensive foundation for building a socialist system in Poland.
    In order to accomplish the above task, we must eliminate and overcome a number of difficulties left to us by the capitalist system, namely: First, the existence of the exploiting classes and their hostile behavior towards the national economy, the working people, and the people's state; Second, the economic backwardness of the country and the damage caused by the war and the occupation of the Hitler bandits; Third, the low labor productivity caused by this backwardness, and the still unsatisfactory living standards of the masses caused by this backwardness; Fourth, the cultural backwardness of large sections of the masses, which was left to us by the governments of capitalists and landlords; Fifth, the existence of bureaucracy in our state institutions; Sixth, the unsatisfactory health situation of our people. Under the leadership of our party, guided by historical experience and the theory of Marxism-Leninism, the united working class will undoubtedly overcome these difficulties.
    What are the main tasks of the people's democratic state, which we have defined as striving to establish socialism? It is to create possible welfare and cultural conditions for the masses of the people in the context of modern science and our country's natural potential. Socialism is not just about the fair distribution of the fruits of labor produced by society; it is primarily about the highest level of productive forces development that can be achieved under current technical knowledge.
    Both the victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of socialism in the Soviet Union relied on the alliance of workers and peasants. People's democracy in Poland must also rely on the alliance of workers and peasants in the work of establishing the foundations of socialism. It is impossible to build socialism in the cities without fighting for the development of the countryside and without increasing agricultural output.
    Under the conditions of people's democracy, the struggle between rural capitalists and land-poor peasants and middle peasants is continuing and becoming more acute. Rural capitalists must do heavy labor for him when others borrow his draught animals or farm implements, and give loans and industrial products to diligent farmers to ensure his dominant position in the lower-level organizations of rural cooperatives and state administrative organs and autonomous organs. This is how the struggle is going on between rural capitalists and diligent farmers. The people's democratic state must mobilize poor and middle peasants to fight against exploiters and end this exploitation.
    However, the firm guarantee of the welfare of diligent peasants and the great increase in agricultural production are only possible under collective farming in the form of producer cooperatives. This has been best proven by the experience of the Soviet Union. The specific forms of this cooperation suitable for our situation will be created and decided by the Polish peasants themselves, who will rely on their own efforts and their alliance with the working class, and they will be convinced of the superiority of collective farming by their own personal experience.
    The whole society, and especially the peasants themselves, are concerned about the improvement of agricultural productivity. The task of the state and the working class as allies of the peasants is to give them help when they ask for it, in order to transition to more advanced and more productive farming methods. The peasants themselves will decide these issues. All the rumors that the people's democratic state will use coercion or force on the peasants are big lies spread by the enemies of the working people, who hope that the peasants will be poor and backward so that they can easily exploit and deceive them.

　　波兰统一工人党的任务
    （波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特一九四八年十二月十五日在波兰统一工人党大会上报告的最后一部分）
    人民民主的波兰成立以来的短短时期中，已达成了如下的成就：一，共和国的独立与边境之稳固的保证；二，国家从战争破坏中迅速恢复、国家迅速工业化以及社会化部分的经济潜力之扩大；三，与西部领土之团聚及其发展；四，失业之消除，工人物资条件的不断改进，为公众的进步提供广泛的机会，及劳动人民之日益增多的参与国家行政工作；五，农民大众缺少土地的情况大为减少及其生活情况的改进；六，各级教育的发展，使最广大的群众有受教育与接近文化的机会；七，劳动妇女处境的改善；八，为工人农民青年提供了广泛的工作与学习的机会。
    依靠着这些成就，首先是依靠劳动人民的团结——其表现便是工人阶级的政治团结——统一的党就把发动全面地为波兰建设社会主义制度的基础，规定为自己的伟大历史任务。
    为了完成上述这一任务，我们就必须清除与克服资本主义制度所遗留给我们的若干困难，即：一，剥削阶级的存在及其对于国民经济、劳动人民与人民国家的敌对行为；二，国家在经济上的落后性以及因战争与希特勒匪徒的占领所造成的破坏；三，由于这个落后性而造成的低下的劳动生产率，以及这个落后性所造成的群众生活水平仍不能令人满意；四，群众中广大阶层的文化落后，这是资本家与地主的政府所遗留给我们的；五，我们的国家机构中存在官僚主义分子；六，我国人民健康的不能令人满意的情况。在以历史经验及马列主义学说为指导方针的我党领导之下的团结的工人阶级，无疑地将克服这些困难。
    被我们规定为争取建立社会主义的人民民主国家，其主要任务是什么呢？是在现代科学与我国自然潜力的情况下，建立人民大众的可能的福利与文化条件。社会主义并非仅只是公平分配社会所生产的劳动果实，它首先是在当前技术知识的条件下所能达到的生产力发展中的最高水平。
    十月革命的胜利与苏联之建立社会主义，两者都是依靠工农联盟的。波兰的人民民主在建立社会主义基础的工作中，也必须依靠工农联盟。要是不为农村的发展而斗争，要是没有农业产量的增加，在城市建立社会主义是不可能的。
    在人民民主的条件下，在农村中，农村资本主义分子与少地的农民及中农之间的斗争正在继续着，并且变得更加尖锐。农村资本主义分子当别人借用他的耕畜或农具时，必须为他作荷重的劳动，给他勤劳农民放贷款项及工业品，以保证他自己在农村合作社及国家行政机关和自治机关的下层组织中居于统治地位。农村资本主义分子与勤劳农民之间正这样进行着斗争。人民民主国家必须动员贫农、中农去与剥削者斗争，并终止这种剥削。
    然而，勤劳农民福利的稳固保证与农业生产的大大增进，只有在以生产者合作社的形式，实行集体耕作的情况下才是可能的。这已由苏联的经验得到了最好的证明。这种合作的适合于我们情况的具体形式，将由波兰农民自己去创造和决定，他们将依靠自己的努力及与工人阶级的联盟，他们将因亲身的经验而相信集体耕作的优越性。
    全体社会，首先是农民自己，关切着农业生产率的提高。国家及作为农民同盟者的工人阶级的任务，是当农民要求帮助时，给他们以帮助，以便过渡到更高级的与更大生产力的耕作方式。农民自己将决定这些问题。说什么人民民主国家将运用高压手段或胁迫农民的一切谣言，都是劳动人民的敌人所撒的大谎，他们盼望农民贫穷落后，以便让他们容易地进行剥削与欺骗。（按：一、本文根据塔斯社电讯稿；二、标题为编者所拟）
