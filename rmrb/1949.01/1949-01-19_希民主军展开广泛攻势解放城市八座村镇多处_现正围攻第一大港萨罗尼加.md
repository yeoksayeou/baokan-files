Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The Greek Democratic Army's broad offensive against the Royalist-Fascist forces throughout Greece is proceeding according to General Markos's declaration to "inflict heavier blows on the enemy in the winter of 1948." According to incomplete statistics, from late December to the present, a total of eight cities and numerous towns, strongholds, and villages have been captured or liberated.

　　In northern Greece: The 11th Division of the Democratic Army, operating in central Macedonia, launched an offensive against Thessaloniki, the largest port and second largest city in Greece, and its periphery, starting in late December. On the 21st, the Democratic Army, in a ten-hour offensive, captured the enemy base of Kirkis, a town on the railway line north of Thessaloniki. Enemies coming from nearby strongholds in an attempt to retake the city were repelled. The Democratic Army annihilated many enemies and captured a large number of spoils. Starting on the 25th, the Democratic Army attacked towns, railway stations, and villages near Thessaloniki, and advanced to the suburbs within five kilometers of Thessaloniki, shelling the enemy headquarters, barracks, and armories in the city. The Democratic Army artillery also fired propaganda shells with leaflets and pamphlets into the city to carry out a political offensive. On the 7th of this month, another unit of the Democratic Army landed on the east coast of the Gulf of Thessaloniki by sea, liberating the city of Potidaea south of Thessaloniki. On the evening of the 6th of this month, units of the 20th Brigade of the Democratic Army crossed the Struma River (northeast of Thessaloniki), penetrated deep into enemy-held areas such as Bravi, and captured seven enemy strongholds after fierce fighting. At the same time, the Democratic Army, launching a wide offensive in central and western Macedonia, won successive victories, and the cavalry of the Democratic Army also participated in the battle. In the four days from December 24th to 27th, the Democratic Army successively entered or raided the four cities of Florina, Edessa, Polykastro, and Nireta, annihilating the enemy garrison forces and destroying enemy fortifications, police stations, and power stations. Hundreds of residents in the two cities of Edessa and others voluntarily joined the Democratic Army.

　　In the center: The 1st Division of the Democratic Army, operating in the Thessaly Plain, after liberating the city of Karditsa in mid-December, broke through the enemy defense line of the city of Trikala, north of Karditsa, and entered the city in early January. In the Grammos Mountains, units of the 8th Division of the Democratic Army launched a strong offensive against the enemy's fortified positions in the Rikkola district with dense mortar fire in early January, and attacked enemy garrisons in four other places, and also routed enemy military columns on the highway in the Voinon region, causing heavy casualties to the enemy.

　　In the south: The 3rd Division of the Democratic Army, operating in the Morea Peninsula, has crushed the offensive launched by the Royalist army since December, and launched a powerful counter-offensive, liberating two towns. The commandos of the Democratic Army also entered Corinth, an important city in the northeastern part of the island, and withdrew voluntarily after attacking enemy barracks and destroying the railway station.
