    Jiangli Village in Yangcheng County, southern Shanxi, is a village in the old Taiyue Liberated Area. In the past, this village was very feudal on the issue of marriage for men and women. Generally, marriages were arranged by parents, and some were even bought and sold. However, the atmosphere in this village is now changing. Since 1945, the unions of thirty-four young men and women have been entirely of their own choosing. Yang Xiaolin was the first in this village to marry freely.
    Xiaolin's freedom in marriage was the result of her own struggle.
    Her family was poor peasants, and her mother died early. Her father, according to the old customs left over from the old society, sought a husband for her. However, Xiaolin had heard about the democratic government's policy of freedom of marriage, and she believed that "her lifelong affair should be decided by herself," so she firmly opposed the marriage contract, saying to her father, "You want their things, you go, I won't go!" She was in love with Yuan Xiaotu, a young militia member from her village. Soon her father found out, gave her a severe beating, and warned her that if she continued to associate with Xiaotu, he would sever his father-daughter relationship with her. But Xiaolin was very determined. She secretly got engaged to Xiaotu and told her father that she wanted to marry. Her father couldn't stop her and glared at her in anger, scolding, "Rebellion! Little girl, we are like an old man's beard, split on both sides. Don't ever come to my house after you die. I'll just pretend I raised you for nothing!" Xiaolin's persuasion was ineffective, so she had to leave her father. She and Xiaotu registered at the district government and asked the village cadres for help, held a meeting, and got married.
    Their wedding was completely different from the marriages in the village in the past. Xiaolin didn't ride in a sedan chair, nor did she dress up like a bride in an old-fashioned wedding. At her wedding, the village cadres all spoke, encouraging them to "husbands plow and wives weave, produce and prosper." They also made a guarantee to compete with each other and strive to be models.
    Xiaolin's father ignored Xiaolin from then on. Xiaolin's mother-in-law thought she was a "wild daughter-in-law who ran in on her own," so she didn't like her either. She only gave her food but didn't care about her clothes. She put on a stern face and said to Xiaolin, "New for three years, old for three years, patching and mending for another three years, you just take care of it yourself!"
    Xiaolin was determined to produce well and not rely on others. She originally knew how to spin good thread, and soon she learned to weave cloth. Not only did she clothe herself, but she also replaced all the family's clothes with new ones. With Xiaotu's help, Xiaolin also learned to do farm work. She worked as hard as Xiaotu from early morning till late at night, not even caring when her hands were blistered. Soon she could handle the plow, weed, and harvest, becoming an "all-around hand." In production, Xiaolin gradually won the support of all the women in the village. Only one year after her marriage, in 1946, she was elected chairman of the village women's federation.
    Unlike other couples in the village, she and Xiaotu never fought or scolded each other, and they competed with each other to make progress. When Xiaotu left home to participate in political work, she bravely shouldered all the labor of supporting a family of four.
    Many young and middle-aged men in the village joined the People's Liberation Army or government work, and there was a relative lack of labor. Xiaolin actively mobilized and organized young and middle-aged women to work in the fields with her own exemplary actions. She first organized a mutual aid team. Under the influence of this mutual aid team, it quickly developed into eleven mutual aid teams, in which two hundred and eighty-six women were organized, one hundred and two of whom learned to plow. From March to September 1947, the women of the whole village hoed more than 600 mu of seedlings, harvested wheat, millet, corn, beans, etc., totaling more than 3,300 mu, picked 1.98 million cotton peaches, and carried more than 800 dan of manure. Spinning and weaving were not relaxed either. During the same period, the 28 spinning and weaving mutual aid teams in the village spun 4,500 jin of yarn and wove more than 2,000 bolts of cloth. In addition to supplying the village for their own clothing, more than 600 bolts were sold. In this way, she was elected as the "First Labor Model" at the Labor Hero Conference in Yangcheng County. The "Xiaolin Mutual Aid Team" she directly led also won the first prize.
    Xiaolin's mother-in-law, wearing cloth woven by Xiaolin and eating grain grown by Xiaolin, naturally changed her attitude towards her. When Xiaolin went to the fields or to meetings, she would prepare meals at home and wait for her; she would give Xiaolin good things to eat first. She also praised Xiaolin to everyone she met, saying, "Our daughter-in-law is worth more than a son!"
    Xiaolin's father saw that his daughter was praised by everyone and rewarded by the government, and he also felt honored. He personally brought things to visit his daughter.
    When Xiaolin and Xiaotu got married freely, the old people in the village couldn't get used to it and pointed fingers and whispered behind their backs, saying, "Oh my, what is it coming to!" But now they all say, "The old people have suffered, but it's better to let the children decide their lifelong affairs themselves!"

    山西南部阳城县匠礼村是太岳老解放区的一个村子。过去这个村子在男女婚姻问题上是很封建的，一般地都是父母包办婚姻，甚至还有的是卖卖婚姻，但是，现在这个村子的风气已经在转变了。从一九四五年以来，已经有三十四对青年男女的结合是完全由自己作主的。杨小林就是这个村里自由结婚的头一个。
    小林的婚姻自由，是她自己一场斗争的结果。
    她的娘家是贫农，娘早死了。她爹按照旧社会遗留下来的老规矩替她寻了一个婆家。但是，小林听过民主政府的婚姻自由政策，她认定“自己一辈子的大事要自己作主”，就坚决地反对婚约，向她爹说：“你要人家的东西，你去我不去！”她和本村的青年民兵袁小土要好。不久她爹知道了，把她痛打了一顿，并且警告她如果再和小土混，就和姓断绝父女关系。但是小林非常坚决，偷偷地和小土订了婚，并且告诉她爹要结婚。她爹阻拦不住，气得瞪起眼睛骂：“造反了！小妮子，咱们是老头的胡子两边撇，往后你死也不要来俺家了，就当老子白养了你！”小林劝解无效，只得离了她爹，就和小土到区政府登记，并请村干部帮忙，开了个会，结了婚。
    他俩的婚礼和过去村里嫁娶完全两样。小林不坐轿，也没象旧式结婚的新娘那样打扮。在她的婚礼上，村干部都讲了话，勉励他们：“夫耕妇织，生产发家”。他俩也提出保证，要互相竞赛，争取作模范。
    小林爹从此不理小林了。小林婆婆认为她是“自己跑上门来的野媳妇”，也不喜欢她，只给吃饭，不管穿衣。她板起面孔对小林说：“新三年，旧三年，拆拆补补又三年，你自己瞧照着办吧！”
    小林决心好好生产，不靠别人。她原来就会纺一手好线，不久又学会了织布，不但自己穿上了，还给全家都换上了新衣裳。在小土的帮助之下，小林又学会了做地里的活，起早搭黑和小土一样劳动，手上打起泡也不管。不久她就会掌犁，会锄草，会收割，成了“全把式”。在生产中，小林逐渐取得了全村妇女的拥护，从结婚后仅仅一年，一九四六年就当选了村妇联会主席。
    和村里别的夫妇不一样，她和小土两人不打也不骂，而且互相比赛进步。小土离开家庭参加了政治工作，她就勇敢地担负起养活一家四口的全部劳动。
    村里不少青壮年参加了解放军或政府工作，劳动力比较缺乏。小林就以自己的模范行动积极动员组织青壮妇女上地作活。她首先组织了一个互助组，在这个互助组的影响下，很快就发展成为十一个互助组，在这十一个互助组里组织了二百八十六个妇女，其中有一百零二人学会了犁地。一九四七年三月到九月，全村妇女共锄苗六百多亩，割麦子、谷子、收玉米、豆子等共三千三百多亩，打棉花桃一百九十八万个，担粪八百多担。纺织也没有放松，在同一时间内，本村二十八个纺织互助组纺纱四千五百斤，织布两千多匹。除供村中自穿外，还卖出了六百多匹。这样，她就在阳城县的劳动英雄大会上被选为“第一劳动模范”。她直接领导的那个“小林互助组”也得到头等奖。
    小林的婆婆穿着小林织的布，吃着小林种的粮食，自然就对她转变了态度。小林上地、开会去了，就在家里作好饭等她；有好东西，先给小林吃。还逢人便夸奖说：“咱家媳妇就顶个小子！”
    小林的爹看见女儿博得人人夸奖，又受到政府奖励，也感到光彩，亲自提上东西上门来看闺女。
    小林和小土自由结婚时，村里老人们都看不惯，指手划脚地背后嘀咕说：“哎哟，成什么话呀！”但是现在他们都说：“老人们都受了罪了，一辈子的大事到底还是让孩们自己作主好！”
