Title: Gloomy Overseas Markets, US Exports Decline

Overseas markets present an even more dismal picture. Despite the seven billion dollars of "Marshall Plan" aid, US exports in 1948 actually decreased from 15.3 billion dollars in 1947 to 13 billion dollars, a drop of over 15 percent. If the depreciation of the US dollar is taken into account, the percentage decrease would be even more alarming. This is why Truman clamored for increased exports in his address.

The simultaneous shrinking of domestic and foreign markets resulted in US warehouse inventories reaching a record 54.4 billion dollars in December 1948, an increase of 20 billion dollars over the previous year.

The US government, from Truman's State of the Union address at the beginning of this year to Sawyer's year-end economic review last year, while acknowledging the seriousness of the economic situation, has attempted to conceal the truth from the American people with a series of misleading figures, claiming that 1948 was "another year of abundance and prosperity." They cite: In 1948, the total value of all goods and services produced in the United States reached a peak of 253 billion dollars. The industrial production index rose from 170 in 1946 and 187 in 1947 to 192 in 1948 (using the average from 1935 to 1939 as the base); after-tax net profits of companies rose from 12.8 billion dollars in 1946 and 18.1 billion dollars in 1947 to 21.7 billion dollars in 1948.

However, these figures only expose the abnormal development of military production expansion, profit inflation, tax inflation, and currency inflation in the US economy, as well as its deepening internal contradictions. Even Truman and Sawyer themselves cannot but admit that this "prosperity" in 1948 "largely reflects high prices," and that industrial production is actually supported by "large expenditures from the federal government's foreign aid and military programs." This means that the federal government is supporting the "prosperity" of military and foreign aid material production with a burden that is more than ten times higher per person per year than before the war. Military capitalists have certainly earned huge profits that are higher than any previous year, but the purchasing power of the American working people has been greatly weakened, which will inevitably deepen the degree of the coming economic crisis.

American capitalists understand this, and they have not believed Truman's "prosperity" myth. The sensitive stock market shows this. In this year of unprecedented profit margins, stock trading showed unusual weakness. The average price of the Associated Press's sixty stocks at the beginning of the year was $67.10, but it fell to $64.50 at the end of the year. After summarizing the year's securities market situation, the Associated Press economic reporter couldn't help but naively wonder: "The famous principle that so-called company income is the determinant of stock prices has to be abandoned."

News from the United States in early January 1949 indicated that the production cuts, layoffs, and retail price declines that had occurred on a large scale in the consumer goods industry since the third quarter of last year were continuing after the New Year. Many commodities are being sold at 75% or even 60% of their original prices. The Washington Post exclaimed on January 3: "As we enter 1949, the question is no longer whether an economic downturn will come, but to what extent will it be."

### 国外市场一片暗淡美对外输出已减少

　　国外市场一片暗淡美对外输出已减少
    国外市场呈现一幅更惨淡的景象，虽然有七十亿美元的“马歇尔援外计划”，一九四八年美国的输出却反而从一九四七年的一百五十三亿元减少到一百三十亿元，即跌落了百分之十五以上。如果算上美元的贬值，则跌落的百分比将更为惊人。这就是杜鲁门何以要在其咨文中号叫增加输出的原因。
    国内外市场的同时缩小，使得一九四八年十二月美国仓库的存货已到达五百四十四亿元的纪录，比前一年增加了二百亿元。
    美国政府，自杜鲁门今年初的国情咨文到沙逸的去年终经济检讨，虽然承认经济情势的严重，但却以一系列唬人的数字，企图对美国人民掩盖真象，说什么一九四八年是“又一年的丰足与繁荣”。他们举出：一九四八年美国全部货物与劳务生产总值达到二千五百三十亿美元的高峰。工业生产指数从一九四六年的一七○与一九四七年的一八七上升至一九四八年的一九二（以一九三五至一九三九年的平均数为基数）；公司纳税后的纯利自一九四六年的一百二十八亿元与一九四七年的一百八十一亿元上升至一九四八年的二百一十七亿元。
    但是，这些数字，只是暴露美国经济中军火生产膨胀、利润膨胀、税收膨胀与通货膨胀的畸形发展及其日益加深的内部矛盾。连杜鲁门与沙逸自己都不能不承认：一九四八年的这种“繁荣”，“大半是反映物价之高涨”，工业生产实际上是由“联邦政府的对外援助与军事计划的大量支出”支持着的。这就是说：联邦政府以平均每人每年较战前高出十倍以上的负担支持了军火与援外物资生产的“繁荣”。军火资本家固然因此赚进了较任何一年为高的巨额利润，但美国劳动人民的购买力，则是大大削弱了，这必然会加深行将到来的经济危机的程度。
    美国资本家是懂得这点的，他们并没有相信杜鲁门的“繁荣”神话。敏感的证券市场表明了这一点。就在这利润率达到空前高度的一年，股票交易却表示了不寻常的疲软。美联社六十种股票年初的平均价格是六十七元一角，年终时降低到六十四元五角。美联社经济记者在综述一年证券市场情况后，不禁天真地怀疑：“所谓公司收入乃是股票价格决定因素的著名原理，只好被人放弃。”
    一九四九年一月上旬来自美国的消息说明：自去年第三季起，消费品工业中所大量发生的减产、解雇工人及零售物价的下跌，在新年之后仍在继续中。许多商品都在按原价的七五折乃至六折出卖。一月三日的华盛顿邮报对此惊叫道：“当我们进入一九四九年的时候，问题已经不在于经济衰落来不来，而是这种衰落要到如何程度了。”
