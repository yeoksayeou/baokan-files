Broad Readers Cherish this Newspaper and Continue to Offer Suggestions for Improvement (Second Series)
  Learning and Discussion are Very Effective
    (I)
    I have the following requirements and hopes for the future publication of the newspaper:
    1.  Collect and publish more stories about Chairman Mao. I believe that Chairman Mao's vivid revolutionary stories have a great impact and educational significance for everyone.
    2.  Continuously publish the literary works of Zhao Shuli and reporters from the front lines, because these works vividly reflect the stories of the front lines and the people, publicize our party's policies, and also help with cultural learning.
    3.  I think the "Public Blackboard" is very well done. It uses popular words and sentences to tell the broad masses of rural laborers about the victories at the front and land reform, production, and other things in the rear. I think it should be enriched further on the existing basis.
    4.  "Learning and Discussion" has played a considerable role in learning, especially the interpretation of policies. For example, the questions and answers in "Learning and Discussion" in issue 185 of the newspaper are the most welcome to me. I hope you will maintain regular contact with various learning units (especially the leading learning units) in the future and publish their learning experiences and gains in a timely manner.
    The above are just my personal feelings, written for your reference. I hope you will adopt them critically.

    What I cannot lack every day, like eating, is reading our newspaper - People's Daily. Now that I see you are soliciting readers' opinions, I have also chatted with my comrades. I am writing our opinions below:
    1. We love to read the Public Blackboard on the masthead the most, because it is short and concise and says the main important things. We hate to read a series of long numbers, such as ××× army ××× division ××× regiment... It is difficult to remember after reading, and we only love to read simple victories, such as taking Changchun and liberating Shenyang.
    2. I love to read the battle stories on page four, and the newly added Learning and Discussion. I hope to publish more of these things. In addition, you can publish some short plays.

    Publish More Articles and Introduce Youth Activities
    (III)
    Your newspaper is soliciting opinions. I would like to offer my personal opinions for reference:
    In the future, the number of pages should be doubled, and more editorials or articles can be published. In this way, the propaganda effect will definitely be great. I hope to publish more articles on medicine, health, and education, and I hope to solicit more manuscripts from educators at all levels of schools. In short, I not only hope to achieve perfection in reporting on the current situation, reporting on cities and villages, and guiding political thought, but also hope to make some systematic introductions in natural and social sciences.

    I saw that your newspaper published a solicitation of readers' opinions on page four on December 21st of last year. I have a small opinion of my own, and I don't know if it is correct. I hope you will consider it.
    I think our newspaper lacks information about youth learning and life. We should introduce more information about the learning and life of young people in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries during the construction period, especially the various activities of Soviet youth during the Soviet-German war and in the recent years of construction. We should also introduce how young people in the British and American imperialist rule are not free and are oppressed. At the same time, we should reflect more of the various activities of young people in various liberated areas and our North China region. I very much hope that there will be a column in the People's Daily that introduces the learning and life activities of young students, or that it will be published regularly. Although there are existing publications about young people, they still cannot meet our needs.

    Do Not Lack Literary Works
    (V)
    Your newspaper is soliciting readers' opinions. I have the following opinions:
    1. All columns should be labeled with names.
    2. Do not lack literary works.
    3. The newspaper not only does not arrive in a timely manner, but also is often interrupted, so that continuous works cannot be continued to be read. According to my understanding, the correspondent travels too far, and when he is tired, he asks someone to take it for him, so he often does not receive it. A better way is: on the one hand, reduce the area of the correspondent's delivery, and the correspondent should be equipped with a car; on the other hand, the correspondent must hold a certificate of receipt signed and stamped by the reader before it is considered delivered. In this way, he will not only no longer be lazy, but also be able to check each other when the newspaper is short.
    4. The Public Blackboard should be written in a more rhyming way, so that it is more fluent to read and the masses will love to read and listen. Otherwise, it can be made into a very popular short essay, just like chatting with farmers.　　　　Reader Wang Jinyi
    Also Publish More Frontline Correspondence to Encourage Everyone's Fighting Spirit
    (VI)
    Taking this opportunity to solicit readers' opinions, I would like to talk about my thoughts and opinions on page four. After reading the several frontline correspondences published in recent days, such as "I Have No Enemy" and "An Army that Overcomes Difficulties," I have gained a great deal of education. I have a clearer understanding of how the People's Liberation War has gone through such hard struggles to achieve today's situation. In the past, I also knew that the revolution was a long and arduous process, but it was never as profound as it is today. When I think of myself still studying in the safe rear, I have made certain preparations in my mind for my future work. Because my understanding of the revolution has deepened, I have increased my strength a lot. If the rural masses know about these deeds, they will understand how the victory of the war was achieved, and how the people's army fought and sacrificed to defeat all the brutal enemies, which will enhance their confidence in victory and their enthusiasm for supporting the front, and they will be proud that such an army belongs to the people. The people's army can defeat everything, and any other force cannot do it. Examples can expand the Party's influence among the masses. This is my feeling after reading every battle correspondence. I always want to know more about how the fighting is going on the front, and I am afraid that the vast number of people in the rear organs and schools feel the same way!
    In the past, the People's Daily did not publish many articles reporting on the war, but now it has been improved. However, I think it is still not enough. The editors should more deeply understand the readers' feelings and recognize the importance of war correspondence. It would be a great loss to isolate such a great scene from the people in the rear. My opinion is that the main content of page four should be to reflect the war situation, so that everyone knows those deeds of historical significance, so that they can increase their confidence, care about the front, and make themselves more closely connected with the war, which will surely improve work efficiency. In addition, some concise articles guiding writing should be published to help the broad readers improve their writing skills, which will also be beneficial to strengthening communication work. Furthermore, Learning and Discussion cannot be ignored.
    The above is just a little opinion of mine. I hope the editors will consider whether it is correct.

    News Should Be Shorter!
    (VII)
    The situation is developing rapidly, and all work must keep up with the new situation; news "should be shorter and shorter," such as the news summary is very good, and can be extended to all aspects of the newspaper. Articles without time limit can be comprehensively and selectively reported. Is this right? Please consider.

### 广大读者爱护本报继续提出改进意见（第二辑）

第4版()
专栏：

　　广大读者爱护本报继续提出改进意见（第二辑）
  　学习讨论很起作用
    （一）
    我对报纸今后出版有这样几点要求和希望：
    一、多搜集登载一些毛主席的故事，我认为毛主席的生动的革命故事，对每个人的影响和教育意义是很大的。
    二、把赵树理及各前线记者的文艺作品能不断的登载，因为这些作品一方面是生动的反映了前线和民间的故事，另一方面又宣传了我党的政策，同时对文化学习也有帮助的作用。
    三、“大众黑板”，我觉得办的很好，它能用通俗的词句，将前方的胜利消息和后方的土地改革，生产等事情，告诉给广大农村的劳苦大众，我认为在现有基础上更应充实它。
    四、“学习讨论”对学习是起了相当的作用，尤其是政策的解释，比如：一八五期报上“学习讨论”上的问题和答复，更为我所最欢迎，希望你们今后和各学习单位（特别是各领导学习的单位）保持着经常的联系，将他们的学习经验和收获及时的登载出来。
    上述几点，仅是我个人的感觉，写出来供你们参考，希望你们批判的采纳。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　华北军区司令部陈少英

    我每天象吃饭一样不可缺少的就是看咱们的报纸——人民日报。现在我看到你们征求读者意见，我也和同志们闲谈过，现把我们的意见写在下面：
    一、我们最爱看报头上的大众黑板，因为它又简短、又说出了主要的大事，最麻烦看一连串长的数目字，如×××军×××师×××团…………等，看了也很难记住，只爱看干脆的胜利，如拿下长春，解放沈阳等。
    二、爱看四版上的战斗故事，及新增的学习讨论，我希望把这些东西再多登一些。另外可登一些小短剧。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者张欣田
    多登论说文章介绍青年活动
    （三）
    贵报征求意见，谨将个人意见提供参考：
    以后篇幅增倍，社论或是论说的文章可以多刊登一些。这样，宣传效果一定很大。医药卫生一类的和有关教育的，希望多刊登一些，并希望向各级学校的教育家们多征求稿件。总之，不只希望在时局报导上，城市农村报导上，政治思想之引导上作到完善，而更希望在自然、社会科学上做些有系统的介绍。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　石家庄三○六厂刘文兴
    （四）
    看到去年十二月二十一日贵报第四版征求读者的意见，我自己有这么一点小意见，不知是否正确，希望参考。
    我觉得咱们报上很缺少关于青年学习生活等方面的情况，应多介绍一些苏联、捷克等国家的青年在建设时期的学习生活情形，特别介绍点关于苏联青年在苏德战争时期和近几年建设中的各种活动。也介绍些在英美帝国主义统治下的青年是怎样不自由受压迫。同时把各解放区和我们华北区青年的各种活动，多反映一些。我很希望在人民日报上有介绍青年学生学习生活等活动的一栏，或是定期出刊。虽现有关于青年的刊物，可是还不能满足我们的要求。
    　　　　　　　　　　　华北育才中学校女一班　肖忱
    不要缺少文艺作品
    （五）
    贵报征求读者的意见，我有下边几个意见：
    一、各种栏要标明名称。
    二、不要缺少文艺作品。
    三、报纸来得不但不及时，而且时常间断，致使有连续性的作品不能继续读下来。据我了解的情形，通信员走的地方太大，疲乏时就找人代捎，所以常常接不到。较好办法只有是：一面缩小通信员送报地区，通信员要备车子；一面通信员必须持有阅者收到签名盖章证，才算送到。这样他不但不再偷巧，并且短了报还能相互检查。
    四、大众黑板要写得押韵些，念起来才流利，群众才爱读、爱听。否则可作成极通俗小文，象和庄稼人闲扯一样也很好。　　　　读者王进义
    还要多登前线通讯　鼓舞大家战斗精神
    （六）
    趁此征求读者意见的机会，谈一点我对第四版的感想和见解。看了近些日子登载的几篇前线通讯如“有我无敌”、“战胜困难的军队”，对我有很大教育意义；更清楚的知道人民解放战争的经过是怎样的艰苦奋斗才得到今天的局面。过去也知道革命是长期的艰苦的，但总没有今天的深刻。当想到自己还在安全的后方学习，便在思想上对今后的工作作了一定的准备。因我对革命体会更深入了一步，增加了我不少的力量。这些事迹若叫农村群众知道了，会使他们了解到战争的胜利是怎样得来的，人民的军队怎样奋斗牺牲才战胜了一切残暴的敌人，便会增强他们胜利的信心和支援前线的情绪，并且为这样的军队是属于人民的而自豪。人民的军队可以战胜一切，别的任何力量则作不到的实例可以扩大党在群众中的影响。这是我读过每一篇战斗通讯后的感想。我总是想多知道一点前方的战斗是怎样进行的，后方的广大的机关学校的人们恐怕也会有同样心情吧！
    过去人民日报对报导战争的文章登载的不多，现在是有了改进。不过，我认为还是作得不够。编者应更深刻地体会到读者的心情，认识战争通讯的重要性，若把那样一部伟大的场面和后方人民隔离起来，是一个很大损失。我的意见是第四版的主要内容应放在反映战争情况，使那些具有历史意义的事迹叫每一个人都知道，使他们增加信心，关心前线，使自己和战争更密切的结合起来，必能提高工作效率。此外还应登载一些指导写作的精简文章帮助广大的读者提高写作能力，对加强通讯工作也会有好处。再对学习讨论也不能忽视。
    以上只是我的一点见解，是否正确希望编者考虑。

    新闻要短些！
    （七）
    时局飞跃发展，一切工作要紧接跟上去，迎接新形势；新闻“应短些再短些”，如新闻提要很好，可推广到报上各方面。无时间性的文章，可综合择要报导。对否？请考虑。
