　　【Taihang News】The peasants of Niuchuan Village in Heshun County are actively hauling coal and accumulating fertilizer to prepare for large-scale production, and are also engaged in various winter sideline productions. Tian Qiansuo, the village branch secretary, gets up before dawn every day to haul three loads of coal from Huangling, five miles away. In addition to village work, he hauled 63 loads of coal in 28 days. Under Qiansuo's leadership, Jin DaXiao, a notorious lazy man in the past, now hauls coal twice every morning, a 60-year-old woman hauls a basket of coal every morning, and Wang Erxiao, a 15-year-old girl, consistently maintains two loads per day. Every day before dawn, more than 270 people crowd to Huangling. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, Shi Zhongke, a disabled veteran with one leg, collects manure (including bedding soil) every day, accumulating 102 loads of fertilizer in 28 days. Liang Gouni, a 65-year-old family member of a revolutionary martyr, sweeps the streets and courtyards every day, accumulating 30 loads of fertilizer in 28 days. According to village statistics: from November 15th to December 12th, in 28 days, the village of 1,220 people had 600 people involved in the production campaign, hauling a total of 12,970 loads of coal, enough for the whole village to burn for eight months, and earning 56,135 yuan in new currency. Old men collect manure, women sweep the streets and pad pigsties, accumulating a total of 19,176 loads of fertilizer. Women spun 99 jin of cotton. They dug 27,450 loads of barren soil (which can be used to make fertilizer), which can fertilize 183 mu of land, equivalent to 140 pack-animal loads or 5,400 dan of smoked soil.
