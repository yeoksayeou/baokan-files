　　The Chinese people are about to achieve final victory in the great Liberation War, a point that is now beyond doubt even in the eyes of our enemies.

　　The war has followed a tortuous path. When the Kuomintang reaction government launched its counter-revolutionary war, their army was about three and a half times the size of the People's Liberation Army, and their equipment and material resources far exceeded those of the People's Liberation Army. They possessed modern industries and modern transportation tools that the People's Liberation Army lacked. They received massive military and economic assistance from American imperialism, and they had undergone long-term preparations. Precisely because of this, the first year of the war (July 1946 to June 1947) was marked by the Kuomintang's offensive and the People's Liberation Army's defense. In 1946, the Kuomintang occupied cities such as Shenyang, Siping, Changchun, Jilin, and Andong in the Northeast, and most of the provinces of Liaoning, Liaobei, and Andong. South of the Yellow River, they occupied cities such as Huaiyin and Heze, and most of the liberated areas of Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Jiangsu-Anhui, Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, and southwestern Shandong. North of the Great Wall, they occupied cities such as Chengde, Jining, and Zhangjiakou, and most of the provinces of Rehe, Suiyuan, and Chahar, creating an imposing and arrogant appearance. The People's Liberation Army adopted the correct strategic policy of focusing on annihilating the Kuomintang's effective strength rather than conserving territory. Each month, they annihilated an average of about eight brigades (equivalent to the current divisions) of the Kuomintang regular army, finally forcing the Kuomintang to abandon its overall offensive plan and, in the first half of 1947, restrict the focus of its offensive to the two wings of the southern front, namely Shandong and northern Shaanxi. The war underwent a fundamental change in the second year (July 1947 to June 1948). Having already annihilated a large number of Kuomintang regular troops, the People's Liberation Army switched from defense to offense on both the southern and northern fronts, while the Kuomintang had to switch from offense to defense. The People's Liberation Army not only recovered most of the lost territories in the Northeast, Shandong, and northern Shaanxi, but also extended the battle lines to the Kuomintang-controlled areas north of the Yangtze and Wei Rivers. At the same time, in the battles to capture cities such as Shijiazhuang, Yuncheng, Siping, Luoyang, Yichuan, Baoji, Linfen, and Kaifeng, they learned siege warfare tactics. The People's Liberation Army formed its own artillery and engineering corps. Do not forget that the People's Liberation Army had no airplanes or tanks, but since the People's Liberation Army formed artillery and engineering corps that surpassed the Kuomintang army, the Kuomintang's defense system, along with its airplanes and tanks, seemed insignificant. The People's Liberation Army was now capable of fighting not only mobile warfare but also positional warfare. Another fundamental change occurred in the first half of the third year of the war (July to December 1948). The People's Liberation Army shifted from a long-term disadvantage in numbers to an advantage. The People's Liberation Army was not only able to capture Kuomintang heavily fortified cities but also able to encircle and annihilate powerful and elite Kuomintang army corps of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of soldiers in one go. The speed at which the People's Liberation Army annihilated Kuomintang forces greatly increased. Look at the statistics of regular enemy troops annihilated above the battalion level (including the enemy troops who revolted): In the first year, ninety-seven brigades, including forty-six complete brigades; in the second year, ninety-four brigades, including fifty complete brigades; in the first half of the third year, according to incomplete statistics, one hundred and forty-seven divisions, including one hundred and eleven complete divisions. The number of complete enemy divisions annihilated in half a year was fifteen more than the total number of complete divisions annihilated in the past two years. The enemy's strategic front had completely disintegrated. The enemy in the Northeast had been completely annihilated, the enemy in North China was about to be completely annihilated, and only a few enemies remained in East China and the Central Plains. The result of the annihilation of the Kuomintang's main force north of the Yangtze River greatly facilitated the People's Liberation Army's future operations to cross the river southward and liberate all of China. Simultaneously with the victories on the military front, the Chinese people also achieved great victories on the political and economic fronts. Because of this, the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War on a national scale is now completely undisputed even in world public opinion, including all imperialist newspapers.

　　The enemy will not eliminate themselves. Neither the Chinese reactionaries nor the American imperialist forces of aggression in China will voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. Precisely because they see that the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War on a national scale can no longer be stopped by purely military struggles, they are paying more and more attention to the methods of political struggle. The Chinese reactionaries and American aggressors are now, on the one hand, using the existing Kuomintang government to carry out "peace" conspiracies, and on the other hand, are designing to use certain people who have connections with both the Chinese reactionaries and the American aggressors and with the revolutionary camp, to provoke and instigate them, telling them to work hard to infiltrate the revolutionary camp, forming a so-called opposition within the revolutionary camp, in order to preserve reactionary forces and undermine revolutionary forces. According to reliable information, the American government has already decided on such a conspiracy plan and has already begun to carry out this work in China. The policy of the American government has shifted from simply supporting the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary war to two forms of struggle: first, organizing the Kuomintang's remaining military forces and so-called local forces to continue resisting the People's Liberation Army south of the Yangtze River and in remote provinces; second, organizing an opposition within the revolutionary camp, trying to stop the revolution here; if it is to move forward, it should be with a moderate color, making sure not to infringe too much on the interests of imperialism and its running dogs. The British and French imperialists are supporters of this American policy. Many people have not yet seen this situation clearly, but it will not be long before people can see it clearly.

　　The question now facing the Chinese people, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations is: should the revolution be carried through to the end, or should it be abandoned halfway? If the revolution is to be carried through to the end, it is to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all reactionary forces by revolutionary means, unswervingly adhere to overthrowing imperialism, overthrowing feudalism, and overthrowing bureaucratic capitalism, overthrow the Kuomintang's reactionary rule throughout the country, establish a people's democratic dictatorship republic led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance throughout the country, give the Chinese nation a great transformation, from a semi-colony to a truly independent country, give the Chinese people a great liberation, overthrowing the feudal oppression and bureaucratic capital (i.e., China's monopoly capital) oppression on their heads, and thereby create a unified, democratic, and peaceful situation, create the preconditions for transforming from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and create the possibility for the development of society from a society of exploitation of man by man to a socialist society. If the revolution is to be abandoned halfway, it is to violate the will of the people, accept the will of foreign aggressors and Chinese reactionaries, give the Kuomintang a chance to breathe, allow the already wounded beast to heal its wounds, and then pounce on one morning and strangle the revolution, returning the country to the dark world. The question is now presented in such a clear and sharp way. Which of the two roads should be chosen? Every democratic party and every people's organization in China must consider this issue, must choose the road they want to take, and must express their attitude. Whether the democratic parties and people's organizations in China can sincerely cooperate without breaking up halfway depends on whether they take a consistent view on this issue, and whether they can take consistent steps to overthrow the common enemy of the Chinese people. Here is to be consistent, to cooperate, not to establish any "opposition party," nor any "middle front."

　　Who are the enemies that the Chinese people oppose today? As everyone knows, it is none other than the reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Cheng, Bai Chongxi, He Yingqin, Zhu Tong, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yunwu, Dai Chuanxian, Wu Dingchang, Xiong Shihui, Zhang Lisheng, Zhu Hua, Wang Shijie, Gu Weijun, Soong Mei-ling, Wu Guozhen, Liu Zhi, Cheng Qian, Xue Yue, Li Huang, Yu Hanmou, Hu Zongnan, Fu Zuoyi, Yan Xishan, Zhou Zhirou, Wang Shuming, Gui Yongqing, Du Yuming, Tang Enbo, Sun Liren, Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, Tao Xisheng, Zeng Qi, Zhang Junmai, etc. These are all top war criminals and public enemies of the Chinese people. Have the Chinese reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek and others not proven themselves to be a bunch of blood-stained, murderous, and unblinking executioners in the long years of more than twenty years from the April 12th counter-revolutionary coup in 1927 to the present? Have they not proven themselves to be a bunch of professional imperialist running dogs and traitors? Please think about it, since the Xi'an Incident in December 1936, since the Chongqing negotiations in October 1945 and the Political Consultative Conference in January 1946, the Chinese people have done everything possible to be benevolent and righteous to this gang of bandits, hoping to establish domestic peace with them. But has all good intentions changed their class nature by one point, one iota, or one thread? The history of these bandits cannot be separated from American imperialism. They relied on American imperialism to plunge 475 million compatriots into an unprecedentedly cruel civil war. They used the bombers, fighters, cannons, tanks, rocket launchers, automatic rifles, gasoline bombs, poison gas bombs, and other murderous weapons supplied by American imperialism to massacre millions of men, women, old and young, while American imperialism relied on them to plunder China's territorial rights, territorial sea rights, airspace rights, inland river navigation rights, commercial privileges, domestic and foreign affairs privileges, and even the privilege of killing people, crushing people to death, and raping women without being subject to any punishment. Should the Chinese people, who have been forced to wage such a long and bloody war, still show love and tenderness to these heinous enemies, instead of completely eliminating and expelling them? Only by completely eliminating the Chinese reactionaries and expelling the aggressive forces of American imperialism from China can China have independence, democracy, and peace. Is this truth not yet clear?

　　It is worth noting that the enemies of the Chinese people are now suddenly trying their best to pretend to be harmless and pitiful (please readers remember that this kind of pitiful appearance will be pretended in the future). Sun Ke, who recently became the President of the Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang, did he not announce in June last year that "in the military aspect, as long as we fight to the end, it can always be resolved"? This time, as soon as he took office, he talked a lot about his "glorious peace," saying that "the government has worked hard to pursue peace, and because peace could not be realized, it was forced to use troops, and the ultimate purpose of using troops is still to seek the restoration of peace." An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on December 21 immediately predicted that Sun Ke's statement "will meet with the widest praise among American officials and Kuomintang liberals." American "officials" are now not only enthusiastic about "peace" in China, but also repeatedly stated that since the Moscow Soviet-American-British Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945, the United States has been abiding by the "policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs." How should we deal with these gentlemen's country gentlemen? Here is a fable from ancient Greece: "A farmer saw a snake frozen in winter. He pitied it and took it to his chest. The snake woke up when it felt warm, and when it regained its nature, it bit its benefactor, causing him a fatal wound. On his deathbed, the farmer said: I pitied the wicked, and I should suffer this evil retribution!" Foreign and Chinese venomous snakes hope that the Chinese people will die like this farmer, and hope that the Chinese Communist Party and all revolutionary democrats in China will have the same good intentions for venomous snakes as this farmer. But the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the true revolutionary democrats of China have heard and remembered this worker's last words. Moreover, the venomous snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes with fangs and snakes transformed into beautiful women, entrenched in most of China's land, although they have already felt the threat of winter, are not yet frozen!

　　The Chinese people will never pity the wicked like snakes, and honestly believe that: whoever plays tricks and says that we should pity these kinds of wicked people, otherwise it is not in line with the national conditions or not great enough, etc., is definitely not a loyal friend of the Chinese people. Why should we pity the wicked like snakes? Which worker, which peasant, which soldier advocates pitying these kinds of wicked people? There are indeed such "Kuomintang liberals" or non-Kuomintang "liberals" who advise the Chinese people to accept the "peace" of the United States and the Kuomintang, that is, to enshrine the remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism as sacred objects, so as not to extinct these treasures in the world. But they are definitely not workers, peasants, or soldiers, nor are they friends of workers, peasants, or soldiers.

　　We believe that the Chinese people's revolutionary camp must be expanded and must accommodate all those who are willing to participate in the current revolutionary cause. The Chinese people's revolutionary cause needs a main force and also needs allies. An army without allies cannot defeat the enemy. The Chinese people, who are in the midst of a revolutionary upsurge, need to have their own friends, should remember their friends, and should not forget them. Friends who are loyal to the people's revolutionary cause, friends who strive to protect the interests of the people and oppose protecting the interests of the enemy, are undoubtedly many in China, and undoubtedly not one should be forgotten or neglected. We also believe that the Chinese people's revolutionary camp must be consolidated, must not allow bad people to invade, and must not allow wrong ideas to prevail. In addition to remembering their friends, the Chinese people who are in the midst of a revolutionary upsurge should also firmly remember their enemies and the friends of their enemies. As mentioned above, since the enemy is conspiring to use "peace" methods and methods of infiltrating the revolutionary camp to preserve and strengthen their positions, and the fundamental interests of the people require the complete elimination of all reactionary forces and the expulsion of the aggressive forces of American imperialism from China, then all those who persuade the people to pity the enemy and preserve reactionary forces are not friends of the people, but friends of the enemy.

　　The angry tide of the Chinese revolution is forcing all social strata to decide their attitudes. The balance of class forces in China is undergoing new changes. Large groups of people are breaking away from the influence and control of the Kuomintang and standing on the side of the revolutionary camp. The Chinese reactionaries are completely isolated and helpless. The closer the People's Liberation War gets to final victory, the more firmly all revolutionary people and all friends of the people will unite and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely advocate the complete elimination of reactionary forces, the complete development of revolutionary forces, until the establishment of a people's democratic republic throughout China and the realization of unified democracy and peace. In contrast, the American imperialists, the Chinese reactionaries, and their friends, although they cannot consolidate and unite, and will have endless mutual quarrels, mutual abuse, mutual complaints, and mutual abandonment, will cooperate with each other on one point, that is, to try to undermine revolutionary forces and preserve reactionary forces in various ways. They will use various methods: open and secret, direct and roundabout. But it can be determined that their political conspiracies will meet with the same failure as their military offensives. The Chinese people and their General Staff, the Chinese Communist Party, who have had ample experience, will surely crush the enemy's political conspiracies just as they crushed the enemy's military offensives, and carry the great People's Liberation War through to the end.

　　In 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will march south of the Yangtze River and will achieve even greater victories than in 1948.

　　In 1949, we will achieve even greater achievements on the economic front than in 1948. Our agricultural production and industrial production will be further improved, railway and highway transportation will be fully restored, and the operations of the main army corps of the People's Liberation Army will get rid of some guerrilla aspects that still exist and enter a higher degree of regularization.

　　In 1949, a political consultative conference without reactionary elements participating, with the goal of completing the people's revolutionary tasks, will be convened to announce the establishment of the People's Republic of China and form the central government of the republic. This government will be a democratic coalition government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party with appropriate representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations participating.

　　These are the main and specific tasks that the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, all democratic parties, and people's organizations in China should strive to achieve in 1949. We will not be afraid of any difficulties and will unite to achieve these tasks.

　　The feudal oppression of thousands of years and the imperialist oppression of one hundred years will be completely overthrown in our struggle. 1949 is an extremely important year, and we should intensify our efforts.

### 将革命进行到底　一九四九年新年献词

　　将革命进行到底
  　一九四九年新年献词
    中国人民将要在伟大的解放战争中获得最后胜利，这一点，现在甚至在我们的敌人方面也不怀疑了。
    战争是走过了曲折的道路的。国民党反动政府在发动反革命战争的时候，他们军队的数量约等于人民解放军的三倍半，他们军队的装备和人力物力的资源更是远远地超过了人民解放军，他们拥有人民解放军所缺乏的现代工业和现代交通工具，他们获得美国帝国主义在军事上、经济上的大量援助，并且他们是经过了长期的准备的。就是因为这样，战争的第一年（一九四六年七月至一九四七年六月）表现为国民党的进攻和人民解放军的防御。国民党在一九四六年，在东北占领了沈阳、四平、长春、吉林、安东等城市和辽宁、辽北、安东等省的大部，在黄河以南占领了淮阴、荷泽等城市和鄂豫皖、苏皖、豫皖苏、鲁西南等解放区的大部，在长城以北占领了承德、集宁、张家口等城市和热河、绥远、察哈尔的大部，声势汹汹，不可一世。人民解放军采取了以歼灭国民党有生力量为主而不是以保守地方为主的正确的战略方针，每个月平均歼灭国民党正规军的数目约为八个旅（等于现在的师），终于迫使国民党放弃其全面进攻计划，而于一九四七年上半年将进攻的重点限制在南线的两翼，即山东和陕北。战争在第二年（一九四七年七月至一九四八年六月）发生了一个根本的变化。已经消灭了大量国民党正规军的人民解放军，在南线和北线都由防御转入了进攻，国民党方面则不得不由进攻转入防御。人民解放军不但在东北、山东和陕北都恢复了绝大部分的失地，而且把战线伸到了长江和渭水以北的国民党统治区。同时，在攻克石家庄、运城、四平、洛阳、宜川、宝鸡、临汾、开封等城市的作战中学会了攻坚战术。人民解放军组成了自己的炮兵和工兵。不要忘记，人民解放军是没有飞机和坦克的，但是自从人民解放军形成了超过国民党军的炮兵和工兵以后，国民党的防御体系，连同他的飞机和坦克就显得渺小了。人民解放军已经不但能打运动战，而且能打阵地战。战争第三年的头半年（一九四八年七月至十二月）发生了另一个根本的变化。人民解放军在数量上由长期的劣势转入了优势。人民解放军不但已经能够攻克国民党坚固设防的城市，而且能够一次包围和歼灭成十万人甚至几十万人的国民党的强大精锐兵团。人民解放军歼灭国民党兵力的速度大为增加了。试看歼敌营以上正规军的统计（包括起义的敌军在内）：第一年，九十七个旅，内有四十六个整旅；第二年，九十四个旅，内有五十个整旅；第三年的头半年，根据不完全的统计，一百四十七个师，内有一百一十一个整师。半年歼敌整师的数目比过去两年歼灭整师的总数多了十五个。敌人的战略上的战线已经全部瓦解。东北的敌人已经完全消灭，华北的敌人即将完全消灭，华东和中原的敌人只剩下少数。国民党的主力在长江以北被消灭的结果，大大地便利了人民解放军今后渡江南进解放全中国的作战。与军事战线上的胜利同时，中国人民在政治战线上和经济战线上也取得了伟大的胜利。因为这样，中国人民解放战争在全国范围内的胜利，现在就是在全世界的舆论界，包括一切帝国主义的报纸，都完全没有争论了。
    敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。正是因为他们看到了中国人民解放战争在全国范围内的胜利已经不能用单纯的军事斗争的方法加以阻止，他们就一天比一天地重视政治斗争的方法。中国反动派和美国侵略者现在一方面正在利用现存的国民党政府来进行“和平”阴谋，另一方面则正在设计使用某些既与中国反动派和美国侵略者有联系，又与革命阵营有联系的人们，向他们进行挑拨和策动，叫他们好生工作，力求混入革命阵营，构成革命阵营中的所谓反对派，以便保存反动势力，破坏革命势力。根据确实的情报，美国政府已经决定了这样一项阴谋计划，并已经开始在中国进行这项工作。美国政府的政策，已经由单纯地支持国民党的反革命战争转变为两种方式的斗争：第一种，组织国民党残余军事力量及所谓地方势力在长江以南及边远省份继续抵抗人民解放军；第二种，在革命阵营内部组织反对派，极力使革命就此止步；如果再要前进，则应带上温和的色彩，务必不要太多地侵犯帝国主义及其走狗的利益。英国和法国的帝国主义者，则是美国这一政策的拥护者。这种情形，现在许多人们还没有看清楚，但是大约不要很久人们就可以看得清楚了。
    现在摆在中国人民、各民主党派、各人民团体面前的问题，是将革命进行到底呢？还是使革命半途而废呢？如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力，不动摇地坚持打倒帝国主义，打倒封建主义，打倒官僚资本主义，在全国范围内推翻国民党的反动统治，在全国范围内建立无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为主体的人民民主专政的共和国，使中华民族来一个大翻身，由半殖民地变为真正的独立国，使中国人民来一个大解放，将自己头上的封建的压迫和官僚资本（即中国的垄断资本）的压迫一起掀掉，并由此造成统一的民主的和平局面，造成由农业国变为工业国的先决条件，造成由人剥削人的社会向着社会主义社会发展的可能性。如果要使革命半途而废，那就是违背人民的意志，接受外国侵略者和中国反动派的意志，使国民党赢得喘息的机会，使已经受伤的野兽养好创伤，然后在一个早上猛扑过来，将革命扼死，使全国回到黑暗世界。现在的问题就是一个这样明白地这样尖锐地摆着的问题。两条路究竟选择哪一条呢？中国每一个民主党派，每一个人民团体，都必须考虑这个问题，都必须选择自己要走的路，都必须表明自己的态度。中国各民主党派各人民团体是否能够真诚地合作，而不致半途拆伙，就是要看它们在这个问题上是否采取一致的意见，是否能够为着推翻中国人民的共同敌人而采取一致的步骤。这里是要一致，要合作，而不是树立什么“反对派”，也不是什么“中间阵线”。
    中国人民今天所反对的敌人是些什么敌人呢？大家知道不是别人，正是以蒋介石、李宗仁、诚、白崇禧、何应钦、祝同、陈果夫、陈立夫、孔祥熙、宋子文、张群、翁文、孙科、吴铁城、王云五、戴传贤、吴鼎昌、熊式辉、张厉生、朱骅、王世杰、顾维钧、宋美龄、吴国桢、刘峙、程潜、薛、立煌、余汉谋、胡宗南、傅作义、阎锡山、周至柔、王叔铭、桂永清、杜聿明、汤恩伯、孙立人、马鸿达、马步芳、陶希圣、曾琦、张君劢等为首的反动派，这些人都是头等战争罪犯，中国人民的公敌。以蒋介石等人为首的中国反动派，自一九二七年四月十二日反革命政变至现在的二十多年的漫长岁月中，难道还没有证明他们是一伙满身鲜血的杀人不眨眼的刽子手吗？难道还没有证明他们是一伙职业的帝国主义走狗和卖国贼吗？请大家想一想，从一九三六年十二月西安事变以来，从一九四五年十月重庆谈判和一九四六年一月政治协商会议以来，中国人民对于这伙盗匪曾经做得何等仁至义尽，希望与他们建立国内的和平。但是一切善良的愿望改变了他们的阶级本性的一分一厘一毫一丝没有呢？这些盗匪的历史，没有那一个是可以和美国帝国主义分得开的。他们依靠美国帝国主义把四万万七千五百万同胞投入了空前残酷的大内战，他们用美国帝国主义所供给的轰炸机、战斗机、大炮、坦克、火箭筒、自动步枪、汽油弹、毒气弹等等杀人武器屠杀了成百万的男女老少，而美国帝国主义则依靠他们掠夺中国的领土权、领海权、领空权、内河航行权、商业特权、内政外交特权，直至打死人压死人强奸妇女而不受任何处罚的特权。难道被迫进行了如此长期血战的中国人民，还应该对于这些穷凶极恶的敌人表示亲爱温柔，而不加以彻底的消灭和驱逐吗？只有彻底地消灭了中国反动派，驱逐了美国帝国主义的侵略势力出中国，中国才能有独立，才能有民主，才能有和平，这个真理，难道还不明白吗？
    值得注意的是现在中国人民的敌人忽然竭力装作无害而且可怜的样子了（请读者记着，这种可怜相，今后还要装的）。最近做了国民党行政院长的孙科，在去年六月间，不是曾经宣布“在军事方面，只要打到底，终归可以解决的”吗？这次一上台却大谈其“光荣的和平”，说什么“政府曾努力追求和平，由于和平不能实现，不得已而用兵，用兵的最后目的仍在求得和平的恢复”。合众社上海十二月二十一日的电讯，马上就预料孙科的声明“在美国官方人士及国民党自由主义人士中，将遇到最广泛的赞扬”。“美国官方人士”现在不但热心于中国的“和平”，而且一再表示从一九四五年十二月莫斯科苏美英三国外长会议以来美国就遵守着“不干涉中国内政的政策”。应该怎样来对付这些君子国的先生们呢？这里用得着古代希腊的一段寓言：“一个农夫在冬天看见一条蛇冻僵着。他很可怜它，便拿来放在自己的胸口上。那蛇受了暖气就苏醒了，等到回复了它的天性，便把它的恩人咬了一口，使他受了致命的伤。农夫临死的时候说：我怜惜恶人，应该受这个恶报！”外国和中国的毒蛇们希望中国人民还象这个农夫一样地死去，希望中国共产党，中国的一切革命民主派，都象这个农夫一样地怀有对于毒蛇的好心肠。但是中国人民、中国共产党和中国真正的革命民主派，却听见了并且记住了这个劳动者的遗嘱。况且盘踞在大部分中国土地上的犬蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢！
    中国人民决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人，而且老老实实地认为：凡是耍着花腔，说什么要怜惜一下这类恶人呀，不然就不合国情，也不够伟大呀等等的人们，决不是中国人民的忠实朋友。象蛇一样的恶人为什么要怜惜呢？究竟是那一个工人，那一个农民，那一个兵士主张怜惜这类恶人呢？确是有这么一种“国民党的自由主义人士”或非国民党的“自由主义人士”，他们劝告中国人民应该接受美国和国民党的“和平”，就是说，应该把帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的残余当作神物供养起来，以免这几种宝贝在世界上绝了种。但是他们决不是工人、农民、兵士，也不是工人、农民、兵士的朋友。
    我们认为中国人民革命阵营必须扩大，必须容纳一切愿意参加目前的革命事业的人们。中国人民的革命事业需要有主力军，也需要有同盟军，没有同盟军的军队是打不胜敌人的。正处在革命高潮中的中国人民需要有自己的朋友，应当记隹自己的朋友，而不要忘记他们。忠实于人民革命事业的朋友，努力保护人民利益而反对保护敌人利益的朋友，在中国无疑是不少，无疑是一个也不应被忘记和被冷淡的。我们又认为中国人民革命阵营必须巩固，必须不容许坏人侵入，必须不容许错误的主张获得胜利。处在革命高潮中的中国人民除了记住自己的朋友以外，还应当牢牢地记住自己的敌人和敌人的朋友。如上所说，既然敌人正在阴谋地用“和平”的方法和混入革命阵营的方法以求保存和加强自己的阵地，而人民的根本利益则要求彻底消灭一切反动势力并驱逐美国帝国主义的侵略势力出中国，那么，凡是劝说人民怜惜敌人、保存反动势力的人们，就不是人民的朋友，而是敌人的朋友了。
    中国革命的怒潮正在迫使各社会阶层决定自己的态度。中国阶级力量的对比正在发生着新的变化，大群大群的人民正在脱离国民党的影响和控制而站到革命阵营一方面来，中国反动派完全陷入孤立无援的绝境。人民解放战争愈接近于最后胜利，一切革命的人民和一切人民的朋友将愈加巩固地团结一致，在中国共产党的领导之下，坚决地主张彻底消灭反动势力，彻底发展革命势力，一直达到在全中国范围内建立人民民主共和国，实现统一的民主的和平。与此相反，美国帝国主义者、中国反动派和他们的朋友，虽然不能够巩固地团结一致，虽然会发生无穷的互相争吵，互相恶骂，互相埋怨，互相抛弃，但是在有一点上却会互相合作，这就是用各种方法力图破坏革命势力而保存反动势力。他们将要用各种方法：公开的和秘密的，直接的和迂回的。但是可以断定：他们的政治阴谋将要和他们的军事进攻遭遇到同样的失败。已经有了充分的经验的中国人民及其总参谋部中国共产党，一定会象粉碎敌人的军事进攻一样，粉碎敌人的政治阴谋，把伟大的人民解放战争进行到底。
    一九四九年中国人民解放军将向长江以南进军，将要获得比一九四八年更加伟大的胜利。
    一九四九年我们在经济战线上将要获得比一九四八年更加伟大的成就，我们的农业生产和工业生产将要比过去提高一步，铁路公路交通将要全部恢复，人民解放军主力兵团的作战将要摆脱现在还存在的某些游击性，进入更高程度的正规化。
    一九四九年将要召集没有反动分子参加的以完成人民革命任务为目标的政治协商会议，宣告中华人民民主共和国的成立，并组成共和国的中央政府，这个政府将是一个在中国共产党领导之下的有各民主党派各人民团体的适当的代表人物参加的民主联合政府。
    这些就是中国人民、中国共产党、中国一切民主党派和人民团体在一九四九年所应努力求其实现的主要的具体的任务。我们将不怕任何困难团结一致地去实现这些任务。
    几千年以来的封建压迫，一百年以来的帝国主义压迫，将在我们的奋斗中彻底地推翻掉。一九四九年是极其重要的一年，我们应当加紧努力。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北三十日电】（附图片）
