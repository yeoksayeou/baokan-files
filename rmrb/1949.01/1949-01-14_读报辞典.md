　　United States Congress—The federal legislative body of the United States, divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives: The Senate is composed of two senators elected from each state, a total of ninety-six from forty-eight states, with a term of six years, and one-third of the senators are re-elected each year; the House of Representatives consists of 435 representatives, with a term of two years, elected by universal suffrage according to a certain population ratio. In the last (80th) Congress, the Republican Party held the majority, but the Democratic Party regained the lead in the re-election last November, with 53 Democratic senators, 42 Republicans, and 1 Progressive; the House of Representatives has 262 Democratic representatives, 171 Republican representatives, and one Labor Party representative who supports Wallace's Progressive Party, with one vacancy.
　　House Un-American Activities Committee—This is a large, overt secret service agency in the United States. Its chairman is called Thomas, and its full name is the "House Un-American Activities Committee," also known as the "Committee on Investigation of Actions Violating American Interests." It is an organization belonging to the U.S. House of Representatives and is a tool used by reactionary forces in the United States, in coordination with their anti-Soviet expansionist policy abroad, to suppress communism and stifle democracy at home. It prompts the judicial organs to file public prosecutions under the so-called crime of violating "national interests," using this despicable means to打击打击 (attack) the American progressive camp, such as the persecution of the American film industry in November 1947, interrogating more than forty owners, producers, and movie stars of famous American film companies, trying to bite out from their mouths that Hollywood (the center of the American film manufacturing industry) had been "infiltrated" by the Communist Party, in order to further persecute democrats. There are many such examples. However, the Communist Party of the United States, democratic parties, and democrats often expose its reactionary conspiracies, and the American people have all come to know that this is a notorious agency that suppresses the American people.
　　Acheson—Also translated as Atchison, is the new Secretary of State of the United States, succeeding Marshall. Acheson was born on April 11, 1893, in Middletown, Connecticut. His father was an Episcopal priest who later became the bishop of Connecticut. Acheson graduated from Yale University in 1915 with a Bachelor of Laws degree. Initially, he served as an Ensign in the United States Navy and as a private secretary to Supreme Court Justice Brandeis. Subsequently, in 1933, he was appointed as Under Secretary of the Treasury, and in 1941 as Assistant Secretary of State. In 1944, he was appointed by Secretary of State Byrnes as Undersecretary of State to handle important diplomatic affairs for Byrnes. When Secretary of State Marshall took office, he was reappointed as Undersecretary of State, resigning in June 1947. During his tenure as Undersecretary of State under Secretary of State Marshall, Acheson's policy opinions advocated the reconstruction of the fascist regimes of Germany and Japan, and that the United States should take the initiative in handling the aftermath of Germany and Japan, without complying with the agreement of the four powers. Therefore, his views formed the basis of an aggressive Marshall Plan for aiding Europe, violating the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions on the German issue. At the same time, Acheson constantly made wild slanders against the Soviet Union, which led to severe reprimands and protests from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.
　　Colony—In order to safeguard their commerce and obtain raw materials in countries with backward production and weak countries, imperialist countries use force or other methods to conquer these backward nations and weak countries, seize their national sovereignty, and establish ruling organs in their territories, depriving the people of their productive interests, ruling the people as their slaves, and encouraging their own people to migrate to these places to engage in industry and commerce. Such places are called imperialist colonies. For example, Malaya, which is currently ruled by the British Empire, is a colony of the British Empire.

    美国国会——是美国的联邦立法机关，分参众两院：参议院由每州选出参议员二人，四十八州共九十六名组成，任期六年，每年改选三分之一；众议院计四三五名众议员，任期二年，由普选依一定人口比例产生。在上届（八十届）国会中共和党占优势，去年十一月重选的结果民主党又占了先，计：参院民主党议员五十三人，共和党四十二人，进步党一人；众院民主党议员二六二名，共和党议员一七一名，另有拥护华莱士进步党的劳工党议员一名，空额一名。
    非美活动委员会——是美国公开的一个大特务机关。主席叫汤姆斯，它的全名是“非美活动调查委员会”，又叫“违反美国利益行动调查委员会”，属于美国国会众议院的一个组织，是美国反动势力配合其在国外的反苏扩张政策而在国内用以反共扼死民主政策的一个工具。它促使司法机关用所谓违反“祖国利益”的罪名提起公诉，用这种卑鄙手段来打击美国进步阵营，如一九四七年十一月的对美国电影界的迫害，审讯四十多个美国著名的电影公司的老板、制片人、电影明星等，想从他们口中咬定好莱坞（美国电影制造业的中心地）已为共产党“侵入”，而来进一步对民主人士加以迫害。这种例子很多。但美国的共产党、民主党派及民主人士经常揭破它的反动阴谋，美国人民都已知道这是一个臭名远扬的镇压美国人民的机关。
    艾奇逊——亦译作亚泽逊，是美国国务院继马歇尔之后的新任国务卿。艾氏于一八九三年四月十一日生于美国康涅狄克州的密德尔镇。父亲是圣公会的牧师，后升任康州的主教。艾氏于一九一五年毕业于耶鲁大学，得法学士位，初期曾作过美国海军少尉及最高法院的最高法官布兰德斯的私人秘书等职。继于一九三三年被任为美国财政部次长，一九四一年被任为美国助理国务卿。到一九四四年又被国务卿贝尔纳斯任为副国务卿为贝尔纳斯处理外交的机要人物，当马歇尔国务卿上台时，仍被任为副国务卿，于一九四七年六月辞职。艾氏在马歇尔国务卿的副国务卿任内时的政策意见，主张重建德日两国法西斯政权，对德日两国善后的问题处理，由美国作为主动的力量，不必遵照四强的同意。因此他的意见造成了一个侵略性的马歇尔的援欧计划的基础，违背了雅尔塔和波茨顿的对德国问题处理的决议。同时艾氏对苏联不断加以狂妄的诽谤，因此遭到苏联外长莫洛托夫的严重的斥责和抗议。
    殖民地——帝国主义的国家，为保障他们在生产落后和弱小的国家里，通行商业和获得生产原料，就以武力或其他的方法去征服这个落后的民族和弱小国家，夺取其国家的主权，而设统治机关于其地，剥夺该民族的生产利益，统治该民族作他们的奴役，奖励本国人民移住于该地，经营工商业，此种地方便称作帝国主义的殖民地。如现在英帝国所统治的马来亚等便是英帝国的殖民地。
