Jinnan District Party Committee Instructs Subordinates to Carry Out Mass New Year Entertainment

[Jinnan Electric] The Jinnan District Party Committee recently issued instructions on carrying out mass New Year cultural entertainment, stating: Our district's masses have experienced a long period of war and several years of intense land reform struggle and production movement, and are in dire need of cultural entertainment to adjust their lives. Especially during this New Year period, as our district's land reform work has been finally completed and the War of Liberation has achieved major victories, the masses will spontaneously rise up to engage in entertainment to celebrate. If we do not organize and lead them, feudal superstition and backward things will inevitably spread everywhere, and improper entertainment such as gambling will inevitably become rampant, which will greatly hinder the ideological education of the masses. Therefore, local, county, and municipal party committees should immediately begin to prepare for various aspects of New Year entertainment activities. 1. Through the central work's work teams and cadres, in conjunction with village cadres and primary school teachers, based on the needs and willingness of the masses (no coercion, no waste of manpower and resources), mobilize and organize the masses of each village to establish various entertainment groups. 2. Each county and city must immediately organize cadres, teachers, intellectuals in the countryside, and folk artists who can write to create new dramas and new songs for application during the New Year, and should especially promote mass self-composition and self-singing: (1) The content of the creation includes celebrating emancipation, joining the army, supporting the front, production, building political power, opposing superstition, opposing arranged marriages, improving culture, current affairs education, etc. (2) The creation form is best to be short and small things that the masses love to hear and see, such as Yangko opera, fast-clapper opera, song performance, flower drum, painted boat, pushing small carts, current affairs live report, big drum, Zhui Zi books, etc. (3) New creations can be performed after review by the district, and good works can be exchanged at any time within the county and sent to the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee at any time. Once adopted and published, in addition to paying royalties, particularly good ones will also be given bonuses. 3. Each county must carefully review and revise many old scripts, drum lyrics, acrobatics, etc., that are popular in rural areas. 4. Mobilize various organs and schools to organize amateur drama clubs, Yangko teams, singing teams, and storytelling teams (including new and old New Year) to promote and help the cultural and entertainment activities of the masses in the驻地. 5. Rural drama troupes are the backbone of mass cultural and entertainment activities. We must restore the rural drama troupes that existed in the past and try to establish new rural drama troupes. Counties and districts should regularly give specific assistance (mainly providing materials and strengthening political and business leadership) to make its work regular and become an organization for mass cultural and entertainment activities and self-education.
