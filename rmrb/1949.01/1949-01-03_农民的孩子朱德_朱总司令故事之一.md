　　Zhu De, the Farmer's Son
  　One of the Stories of Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    Zhang Qin

    Our Commander-in-Chief Zhu De was the child of a tenant farmer. His home was in Linlangzhai, Ma'an Field, Yilong County, Sichuan, eighty li from the county seat. The scenery was extremely beautiful. The house nestled in a mountain hollow, with a bamboo forest behind it, a large expanse of good paddy fields in front, and mountains and deep gullies far in the distance. However, none of these beautiful places belonged to his family, but to a landlord named Ding. This Ding family was very wealthy, owning land for dozens of li around. They collected five thousand shi of rent a year. The Zhu family farmed the land of the two Ding brothers, paying fifty shi of rent a year, plus thirty strings of cash as a deposit – according to the local custom, land wouldn't be rented without a deposit. After paying the rent, there was just enough left to eat. The family was also large, almost twenty people, including grandparents, parents, an uncle, two paternal uncles, and their children. Zhu De's branch alone had six brothers; he was the third oldest. You can imagine that his mother had no time to hold him, as she was busy cooking, carrying water, and farming. He wasn't spoiled as a child, so he is very healthy even now.

    His grandfather farmed all his life, continuing to do so until he was almost ninety. He said he would get sick if he didn't farm. Before dawn, he would wake everyone up. Anyone who got up late would be scolded. All the men and women in the family were either farming, chopping firewood, feeding pigs, or spinning yarn. Even the children had to help. Zhu De both farmed and studied with a teacher. During busy farming seasons, he would stay home and work in the fields completely for months. Therefore, he knew how to do everything in the fields from a young age, such as transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting rice, and operating waterwheels. The family made everything themselves. Zhu De never bought snacks as a child. He ate broad beans, tofu, and dried pickled vegetables that his family made. He wore homespun yarn and cloth. They used tung oil that they pressed themselves to light the lamps. Anyone who went to town to buy something was sure to be scolded upon their return. These habits of labor and frugality in his childhood fostered his later diligence and simplicity. Even now, he always loves labor and production. In the People's Liberation Army, he advocates both fighting and production. He not only commands troops in battle but also guides them in production. The 359th Brigade's reclamation of wasteland in Nanniwan, Yan'an, was under his personal guidance. He also never pays attention to food and clothing, always wearing a set of cloth military uniform.

    He loved catching fish when he was little. There were fish in the paddy fields and ponds near his house. When the rice seedlings were planted in the paddy fields, small fish were released and raised until they grew large. The fish raised in his family's paddy fields were very big, so the Ding landlord said the fish were his and forbade the children from catching them, but he himself would take a net and catch them. The young Zhu De watched helplessly as his favorite big fish were taken away, and he hated it in his heart:
    "Why are they taking our fish?"

    His family also had good fruit trees: pears, walnuts, red dates, and plums, all of which would make any child's mouth water. But as soon as the fruit ripened, the landlord wanted it. Zhu De's grandfather would tell the children to pick it for the Ding landlord and deliver it to his house. The wood in the forest was good, but not even a small tree could be cut. The beautiful bamboo forest behind the house also could not have a single stalk cut.

    They worked so hard for the Ding landlord for so many years. What was the result? They were driven out several times in ten years. The first time, Zhu De was only ten years old. One of the two Ding landlord branches didn't want the Zhu family to farm the land anymore. The Zhu family had no choice but to divide the family in half, telling Zhu De to move to the old house in Dawan with his uncle and youngest uncle. They borrowed more than two hundred strings of cash to redeem some of the pawned items to make a living. After a few years, Ding the elder wanted to raise the rent and increase the mortgage. Zhu De's parents couldn't bear it. There was also a drought. The Ding landlord took back the land on New Year's Eve, forbidding them from farming it and forcing them to move out immediately. The whole Zhu family cried. And so they left the paddy fields, bamboo forests, and orchards they had worked for decades.

    To this day, Zhu De still clearly remembers the first time he saw the struggle and bloodshed of the oppressed. In the year of Gengzi (1900), there was an uprising of the Red Lantern Society in Sichuan. One year, the Ma'an Field saw a team of peasants "eating the big households." A large group came, six or seven hundred people, all dressed like beggars, ragged, men and women, dragging children, holding poles as guns, going to the landlords' doors to demand food. They would leave if they were given rice, or else they would not. Some landlords reported them to the officials. Two days later, more than a hundred soldiers came, saying they had been invited from Baoning Prefecture. They were all wearing red jackets, dragging long queues, carrying bird guns, and there were also officials wearing crystal-topped hats, wearing large headscarves, and wearing double-breasted embroidered jackets and long robes. The gentlemen in the field went to greet the officials in a swarm. Zhu De and his group of children watched from a distance, seeing the soldiers in jackets use bird guns to shoot those peasants who were dragging their families, and also hacking with knives, killing them all as they ran away in panic. The blood trail stretched for forty or fifty li.

    Zhu De's family had a large labor force. Because he was young, his family told him to study, hoping that one day he could "make something of himself" like some people. But this young man, who had witnessed such cruelty in the world, had already planted the seeds of resistance in his heart and began to hate those who slaughtered and oppressed the people.

　　农民的孩子朱德
  　朱总司令故事之一
    张秦
    我们的总司令朱德是一个佃户的孩子，他家住在四川仪陇县，离县城八十里的马鞍场琳琅寨。风景美极了，房子靠在山窝里，屋背后是竹林，前边是一大片好水田，对面远远的有山林和深沟。可是这些好地方都不是他家的，是一家姓丁的地主的。这家姓丁的钱多得很，附近几十里都是丁家的地。一年收五千石租。朱家种丁氏两弟兄的地，一年要拿五十石租，另外还有三十吊钱的押头（押金），——那里的规矩，没有押头人家是不让种地的——把租一交剩的只够吃。家里人又多，差不多够二十个，有祖父母、父母、一个伯伯、两个叔叔，还有他们的孩子，单是朱德这房就是亲弟兄六个，他是老三。你想他的妈妈连做饭挑水种地都来不及，那里还有功夫来抱他呢？他小时候没有经过娇生惯养，所以到现在，身体很健壮。
    他的祖父种了一辈子地，快到九十岁还要种地。他说不种地就要害病。天没亮就把一家都叫起来，谁起晚了就不得下台。全家男女有的种地，有的砍柴，有的喂猪，有的纺纱，连小孩也得动手帮忙。朱德一面种田，一面跟先生读书。农忙时候几个月就完全在家下田。所以，田里的事情象插秧割禾车水等等，他从小都会做了。家里什么东西都是自己做。朱德小时候从没有买过零食吃，吃的都是自己家做的沙胡豆、豆腐、干腌菜；穿的是自己纺的纱，自己织的布；点灯是自己打的桐子油，谁要是上街去买东西，回家来准要挨骂。小时候这种劳动和俭省的习惯，也养成他以后的勤朴作风。直到现在，总是爱劳动，爱生产，在人民解放军里他就提倡一面打仗，一面生产，自己不但指挥部队打仗，还指导部队生产。三五九旅在延安南泥湾开荒，就是他亲自指导的。平常也从不讲究吃穿，总是布军服一套。
    他小时候顶爱捉鱼，他家门口的水田、池塘里，都有鱼。水田栽秧的时候把小鱼放进去，一养，就大了。他家这片水田养的鱼很大，那丁家地主就说鱼是他的，不让小孩们捉，自己却拿网来打去了。幼小的朱德眼睁睁看见自己喜欢的大鱼被人家打去了，他心里很恨：
    “为什么把我们的鱼捉去呢？”
    他家还有好果木树呢！有梨，有核桃，有红枣，有李子，都是每一个小孩看了就会流馋涎的。但是果子一熟老板就要，朱德的祖父就叫孩子们给丁家地主摘，给他家送去。树林的柴很好，可是一根小树也不准砍，屋背后那片好看的竹林，也是一根不准砍的。
    就这样辛辛苦苦替丁家地主干了多少年，结果呢？十年里头却被赶出好几次。头一次，朱德才十岁，那两房丁家地主里，有一房不要朱家种地了，朱家没办法，只好把一家人分成两半，叫朱德跟着伯伯和幺叔搬到大湾的老家去，借了两百多吊钱，赎回一些典当地来过日子。不上几年，丁老大又要加租抵押。朱德的父母支撑不住，天又干旱，丁老板就在年三十晚上收回了地，不准种了，逼着马上搬家，朱家一家人都哭了。就这样离开了自己经营几十年的水田、竹林、和果树园。
    到现在，朱德还清楚记得他小时候第一次看见被压迫者的挣扎和流血。庚子年四川正闹红灯教，有一年马鞍场看见吃大户的农民队伍。一来就是一大群，六七百人，穿的都象叫化子，破破烂烂，男男女女，还拖带着小孩，手里拿着杆子枪，到地主门上要吃的，给他们米就走了，不然不行。有的地主就去报了官。过了两天，就开来了一百多个官兵，说是由保宁府请下来的，个个穿着红马褂，拖着大辫子，扛着鸟枪，还有戴水晶顶子的官，扎着大头包巾，穿的对襟盘花马褂、长袍，场上的绅士一窝蜂都去接官。朱德他们这班小孩子，远远的看，看见穿马褂的兵动手拿鸟枪打那些拖男带女的吃大户农民，还拿刀砍杀，都杀得哄哄的跑，四五十里路全是血迹。
    朱德家里劳动力多，他又小，家里叫他念书，指望他有一天也能象有些人那样“出头”，可是这个亲眼见到了人世如许残酷的少年，心里已经种下了反抗的种子，开始懂得恨那些屠杀人民欺压人民的家伙了。
