Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS reports: The Soviet "Labor News" commented on the British "Four-Year Plan," recently published in the form of a white paper, stating: In capitalist countries, the ruling groups need the high-sounding talk about planned economies only to divert the attention of the laboring masses from the current desperate situation and even more bleak future. The "planned nature" of capitalist countries based on private ownership of the means of production is merely a subjective wish without any basis in real economic forces.

　　The new British Four-Year Plan is also a subjective wish. The Four-Year Plan is formulated according to the guidelines of the Marshall Plan. It stipulates the barbaric exploitation of British colonies in order to extract their raw materials and food. Most of these raw materials and food will be shipped to the United States as payment for Marshall Plan "aid." The Four-Year Plan also attempts to make Britain the main supplier of manufactured goods to Western European countries, while at the same time, Britain will reduce its purchases in European countries and plans to purchase goods from countries within the British Empire. This will further intensify the contradictions within Europe among the Marshallized countries. The Four-Year Plan's stipulations for drastically reducing imports from the dollar world and increasing exports to the dollar world will also provoke a struggle of interests between Britain and the United States.

### 苏联“劳动报”　评英国四年计划

　　苏联“劳动报”
  　评英国四年计划
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社讯：苏联“劳动报”评论英国最近以白皮书形式公布之“四年计划”称：在资本主义国家，关于计划经济的高谈阔论之所以为统治集团所需要，只是为了转移劳苦大众对目前绝望的情况和将来甚至更为黯淡的前途的注意。建基于生产手段私有的资本主义国家的“计划性”，只是一种主观愿望，没有任何真实的经济力量的根据。
    新的英国四年计划，也是一种主观愿望。四年计划是按照马歇尔计划的方针拟定的。它规定对英国殖民地的野蛮压榨，以吸取它们的原料和粮食。这些原料和粮食的大部分，将输往美国作为马计“援助”的付款。四年计划又企图使英国成为西欧各国主要的制造品的供应者，而在同时，英国则削减它在欧洲各国的购买，并计划自英帝国范围之内的各国购买货物。这样，就将使马歇尔化的各国在欧洲内部的矛盾更形加剧。四年计划规定的急剧削减自美元世界的输入，和增加对美元世界的输出，亦将引起英美之间利益的斗争。
