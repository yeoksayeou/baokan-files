　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 11th: TASS reports: Pravda's international observer, Marinin, recently authored an article commenting on the so-called "moral" principles of American expansionists' diplomacy, stating: The experience of 1948 very clearly revealed the so-called "moral principles" that form the basis of American foreign policy. American diplomatic activities are based on the rejection of international cooperation among major powers and the violation of certain decisions made at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. These principles form the foundation of the Anglo-American bloc. They constitute the core of the notorious Marshall Plan, they instigated the "Berlin Crisis" drama, and they explain why agreements to resolve this crisis were thwarted twice. The two divisive conferences held in London last year, which adopted resolutions on the German question, were also based on these principles. Marinin pointed out that Truman's recent statement that it was not the United States but the Soviet Union that failed to fulfill the resolutions of the Yalta and Potsdam conferences is completely inconsistent with well-known facts. The purpose of this statement is to conceal the obvious role of the illegal resolutions on the Ruhr issue passed at the divisive London conference of the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on New Year's Eve, which violated the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. Marinin emphasized that the first "moral principle" that forms the basis of American diplomacy is that the American ruling group and its European partners refuse to fulfill their own international obligations and are attempting to turn the most important international agreements into mere scraps of paper. The second "moral principle" is to transfer all the expenses required for the rule of American monopoly capital to the people of Western Europe in an attempt to transform Western Europe into American colonial property. The third, and most important, "moral principle" is to artificially foster tense international situations, create the "Berlin Crisis," and pursue a policy of aggression and launching new wars. In 1948, the resistance of the masses of people around the world, including those in Western European countries, against American expansionists increased daily. Progressive humanity is indignant at the "moral" "principles" of Wall Street's adventurism.

  　真理报著论抨击
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社讯：真理报国际观察家马里宁顷著文评论美国扩张主义者的所谓“合乎道义”的外交原则称：一九四八年的经验，非常明确地显露了作为美国外交政策之基础的所谓“合乎道义的原则”。美国的外交活动，是基于拒绝大国国际合作和违反雅尔塔与波茨顿会议中某些决定的。这些原则是组成美英集团的基础。它们构成臭名远扬的马歇尔计划的核心，它们鼓动“柏林危机”的演出，并且说明解决此种危机的协定何以两次遭受挫败。去年在伦敦召开的两次分裂会议，通过关于德国问题的决议，也是以这些原则作为它们的基础的。马里宁指出，杜鲁门最近声明所谓不是美国而是苏联未能履行雅尔塔和波茨顿会议的决议云云，完全不合尽人皆知的事实。这个声明的目的，是要掩饰新年前夕美、英、法、荷、比、卢伦敦分裂会议违反雅尔塔、波茨顿协定所通过的鲁尔问题的非法决议的明显作用。马里宁着重地说：作为美国外交基础的第一个“道义原则”，是美国统治集团及其欧洲伙伴拒绝他们自己的国际义务，并且正企图将最重要的国际协定变成一纸具文。第二个“道义原则”，是将美国垄断资本统治所需的费用，全部转嫁到西欧人民的身上，以图变西欧为美国的殖民财产。第三个也是最重要的一个“道义的原则”，是人工地扶持紧张的国际局面，制造“柏林危机”，奉行侵略的和发动新战争的政策。在一九四八年，全世界包括西欧国家在内的人民大众，对于美国扩张主义者的抵抗日益增涨。进步的人类都愤恨华尔街冒险的“道义”的“原则”。
