Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's statement on the current situation on the 14th of this month has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life across the country. In addition to the representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations and other democratic figures, 55 in total, who have arrived in the liberated areas, jointly issued a statement on the 22nd, expressing their firm support for Chairman Mao's statement, the statement has also had a great response in Hong Kong, Shanghai and other places. According to foreign news agency reports, all democratic parties in Hong Kong unanimously expressed their support when discussing Chairman Mao's statement. The Hong Kong Wen Wei Po published an editorial on the 16th stating that Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions are reasonable, have shattered the reactionary派's hypocritical peace proposals, and will strengthen the people's struggle for democracy. In Nanjing, because Chairman Mao's statement reflected the will of the people of the whole country, the Kuomintang Central News Agency, although it did not dare to publish the full text of Chairman Mao's statement, had to publish the eight peace conditions in the statement as they were. All newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai published these eight conditions with large headlines. A Shanghai newspaper published the full text of Chairman Mao's statement, and the newspaper was immediately snapped up by citizens. In addition, Chairman Mao's statement has also received great attention internationally. TASS published most of the statement on the 18th.

  　热烈拥护毛主席声明
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】中共中央毛泽东主席本月十四日关于时局的声明，受到全国各阶层人士的热烈拥护。除到达解放区的各民主党派、各人民团体的代表人物及其他民主人士五十五人已于二十二日联合发表声明，对毛主席声明表示坚决拥护外，该声明在香港、上海等地亦有极大反响。据外国通讯社报导：香港各民主党派在讨论毛主席声明时一致表示赞成。香港文汇报则于十六日发表社论称：毛泽东八项和平条件是合理的，它已粉碎了反动派虚伪的和平建议，并将加强人民争取民主的斗争。在南京，由于毛主席的声明反映了全国人民的意志，国民党中央社虽然不敢将毛主席的声明全文发表，但却不得不将声明中的八项和平条件照原样公布。南京、上海的一切报纸皆以大字标题刊出此八项条件。上海某报刊载了毛主席声明的全文，该报立即被市民抢买一空。此外，毛主席声明在国际上亦受到极大重视。塔斯社于十八日发表了该声明的大部分。
