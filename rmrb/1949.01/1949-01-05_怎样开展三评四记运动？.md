　　How to Carry Out the "Three Evaluations and Four Records" Movement?
  　I. What is the "Three Evaluations and Four Records"?
    The "Three Evaluations and Four Records" movement was created by the civilian laborers during the Linfen Campaign. This method was also used in the Jinzhong Campaign. It is a good method for improving the political consciousness, organizational discipline, military knowledge of the militia and civilian laborers, as well as improving the leadership of cadres. It is also the most democratic political work content that can improve the consciousness of participation. Whichever participating company carries out the "Three Evaluations and Four Records" movement, that company can be consolidated and improved, ensuring the completion of the participation mission.
    What are the "Three Evaluations and Four Records"? The "Three Evaluations" are: evaluating oneself, evaluating others, and evaluating the leadership. The "Four Records" are: Were the tasks completed? How was the performance in completing the tasks? How did you help others? How was the discipline observed?
    II. How to Evaluate? How to Record?
    The first step is that every day or after a task is completed, the squad will evaluate and record the good and the bad; the second step is periodically (every five or seven days) or after a task is completed, the platoon or company will evaluate and record the good and the bad. The evaluation and record results should be submitted to the company or battalion headquarters for review and approval. If there is a suitable place, re-evaluation and re-recording can be carried out. However, when continuously performing tasks or marching continuously, if a meeting cannot be convened, a self-reporting method should be adopted: report your own merits, report the merits of others, and cadres can register and commend at any time. If the cadre sees it with their own eyes, they can immediately record the good and the bad without discussion, and commend or criticize and educate on the spot; the third step is the general evaluation and general recording at the end of the participation (participation summary meeting), adding up the good and bad merits and demerits recorded in each stage (good and bad cannot be offset), and conduct a general evaluation and appraisal. Reward the model heroes; give appropriate criticism and punishment to those who have made mistakes and performed poorly, and fill in the facts of each person's merits or individual desertions and mistakes on the completion certificate and bring it back to the village. Generally, minor problems that have been criticized and recognized will not be filled in on the completion certificate.
    The general standard for evaluating and recording merits and demerits is: three goods are recorded as one merit, and three merits are recorded as one great merit; three bads are recorded as one demerit, and three demerits are recorded as one great demerit.
    III. Establish a Committee for Evaluating Good and Bad.
    The emergence of the Committee for Evaluating Good and Bad is: each class elects a representative to be responsible for leading the evaluation of good and bad in the class or group, report to the committee, and then elect three people from the representatives to form the Committee for Evaluating Good and Bad, one of whom serves as the chairman, responsible for carrying out the daily "Three Evaluations and Four Records" work of the entire company, and suggest to the company commander and instructor to commend and criticize; to become a powerful promoter of the mass mutual merit-making movement. The committee is directly under the leadership of the instructor.
    IV. Issues to be noted in carrying out the "Three Evaluations and Four Records":
    First, in recording the good and the bad and evaluating merits and demerits, the leadership must grasp the standard of evaluation and recording, and the principle of self-criticism, to ensure the correct implementation of the evaluation and recording: recording good and recording merits cannot be mixed with heroes and models. Heroes and models are selected at the end of the participation, according to the size of each person's contribution, through democratic discussion. Only those who are particularly outstanding and brave typicals on the battlefield can be worthy of being models or heroes. Recording the bad and recording the demerits must be separated from criminal behavior. General errors and shortcomings are evaluated and recorded for the purpose of transformation and education, and serious ones should be subject to disciplinary action. Those who commit crimes should be sent to the judicial organs for handling.
    Second, there are different evaluation and recording standards under different tasks: for example, if the same thing was recorded as good the previous time, it may not be recorded as good again this time. If everyone has acted on something and it has become general, then it will no longer be recorded as good. In short, as long as the masses think it is a model, it can be recorded as good. And one cannot simply record the good and the bad, but must combine it with solving thoughts and improving understanding.
    Third, when evaluating the leadership, the team members must be informed in advance to ensure that the cadres do not retaliate, so that the team members dare to raise opinions to the leadership, otherwise evaluating the leadership will become a formality.
    Fourth, after the movement is launched, two deviations must be corrected immediately: one is to overcome the erroneous thinking of some cadres who are afraid of democracy and afraid of raising opinions: "To have military affairs, there can be no democracy, and to have democracy, orders cannot be executed." The other is that in the team, the extreme democratic tendency of "finding fault where there is no fault, nitpicking" must be corrected.

### 怎样开展三评四记运动？

　　怎样开展三评四记运动？
  　一、什么是三评四记？
    三评四记运动是在临汾参战时，民工们亲自创造的，这次晋中战役也运用了这个办法。它是提高民兵、民工政治觉悟、组织纪律、军事常识以及提高干部领导的好办法。又是最民主最能提高参战自觉的政治工作内容。那个参战连队开展了三评四记运动，那个连队可以巩固提高，保证完成参战任务。
    什么是三评四记呢？三评是：评自己、评别人、评领导。四记是：记完成了任务没有？在完成任务中的表现如何？帮助别人怎样？遵守纪律怎样？
    二、怎样评？怎样记？
    第一步是每天或一个任务完了后，以班为单位评好评坏、记好记坏；第二步是定期的（五天或七天）或一个任务完了后，以排或连为单位评记好坏。据评记结果交中队或大队部审查批准。如有了适当的地方，可复评复记。但在连续担任任务或连续行军中，不能召开会议时，应采取随时自报方式：报自己的功劳，报别人的功劳，干部可随时登记表扬。如干部亲眼看到，也可不经讨论立即记好记坏，当场表扬或批评教育；第三步是参战结束时的总评总记（参战总结大会），把每段所评记的好坏功过都加起来（好坏不能抵消），进行总评鉴定。对模范功臣进行奖励；对犯错误表现不好的，给以适当的批评处分，并把各人功绩或个别开小差犯错误的事实，填写在完功证上，带回村去。一般小的毛病经过批评认识的，就不往完功证上填写。
    评记功过标准一般为：记三好为一功，三功为一大功；记三坏为一过，三过为一大过。
    三、成立评论好坏委员会。
    评论好坏委员会的产生是：每班选出一个代表，负责领导本班或小组的评论好坏，向委员会报告，再从代表中推选三人，组成评论好坏委员会，其中一人任主席，负责进行全连日常三评四记工作，并建议连长、指导员进行表扬与批评；成为群众互相立功运动有力的推动者。委员会直接受指导员领导。
    四、开展三评四记中须注意的问题：
    第一、记好记坏与评功论过中，领导上要掌握评记的标准，与自我批评的原则，以保证评记的正确进行：记好记功不能和英雄模范混在一起，英雄模范是在参战结束时，按各人的功劳大小，民主讨论通过选出的，在战场上只有特殊杰出的英勇典型，才能够得上模范或英雄。记坏记过要和犯罪行为分开，一般错误缺点，评记为了改造教育，严重的应受纪律处分。犯罪的就送司法机关处理。
    第二，不同任务下有不同的评记标准：如同样一件事情，前一次记了好，这一次就不一定再记好。一件事如果大家都已行动起来，成为一般性的了，那就不再记好了。总之，只要群众都认为是模范的，就可以记好。且不能单纯记好记坏，要和解决思想提高认识结合起来。
    第三、评领导时，须事前给队员说明，保证干部不报复，才能使队员敢于向领导上提意见，否则评领导就会成了形式。
    第四、在运动掀起后，必须即时纠正两个偏向：一个是克服某些干部因怕民主、怕提意见所产生的：“要军事就不能民主，要民主就不能执行命令”的错误思想。另一个是在队员中必须纠正：“没错找错，吹毛求疵”的极端民主倾向。
