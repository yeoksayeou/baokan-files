　　[Reported by This Newspaper] The entire staff of Shijiazhuang Yumin Industrial Company (formerly known as the Civil Production Management Office), shortly after the liberation of the city, and amidst the ruins left by Chiang Kai-shek's destructive actions, with their spirit of hard work, endurance, and unwavering determination, rapidly restored or rebuilt seven factories, including those for chemicals, machinery, oil production, flour, and dyeing and weaving. Most of these factories began production in January of last year. In the arduous work of resuming production and building factories, the entire staff demonstrated creativity and showed boundless loyalty to the people's cause. The company now has over 500 employees.
    The Yumin Industrial Company and its affiliated factories have achieved significant production results over the past year. They have played a considerable role in regulating military and civilian production and living supplies. During the two instances when the bandit army prepared to launch sneak attacks, the flour mill produced a total of 153,093 bags of flour in eleven months, of which 114,802 bags were supplied to the city's workers and residents, and a portion of military flour was milled on behalf of the supply bureau. The oil production factory produced a total of 28,273 jin of crude oil and sanitary oil. The machine factory, which started operating only five months ago, in addition to manufacturing six batches of machine parts for the repair and maintenance of production tools for its own factory and the company's various factories, also manufactured 12 large-scale lathes and 140 special-purpose machines, which were supplied to state-owned factories in the city and in central Hebei. From May to October, the chemical factory supplied the Bohai area and a certain factory in the city with 27,000 jin of glycerin. It produced a total of 279,244 bars of soap and perfumed soap (perfumed soap counted by the bar), with sales in the city accounting for over 36,000 bars. Although the prices of oil and soda ash soared in July, the supply of soap for military and civilian use was guaranteed at a low price. The dyeing and weaving factory produced a total of 8,028+ bolts of white cloth, colored striped cloth, flour sack cloth, and mosquito netting cloth. The production figures of each factory have been increasing month by month, such as the chemical factory which produced 1,500 jin of glycerin in June, 5,000 jin in July, and increased it to 9,000 jin in September. The weaving factory produced 500 bolts of cloth in July and increased it to 800 bolts in August. The flour mill previously produced 18,000 bags of flour per month, and reached nearly 23,000 bags in August. Especially in late October, during the period of war preparation in Shijiazhuang, prices once soared, affecting the lives of workers and residents. In order to stabilize prices, the company sold more than 14,000 bags of flour, accounting for 70% of the city's total supply at that time. At that time, when citizens were scrambling to buy grain and flour, most private electric mills were shut down, and speculative merchants were frantically taking the opportunity to raise prices, the price of flour was maintained at around 30,000 yuan per bag. This shattered the conspiracy of unscrupulous merchants to speculate and stabilize prices. It demonstrated the leading role of the public economy in the market. (Bai Qing)

　　石市裕民实业公司
  　各厂产量逐月增加
  　调剂军需民用功效很大
    【本报讯】石家庄裕民实业公司（前名为民用生产管理处）全体职工，在该市刚解放不久、即在蒋匪百般破坏的废墟上，用吃苦耐劳坚毅不拔的精神，迅速恢复或重建工厂七处，计有化学、机器、制油、面粉、染织布等。这工厂大部于去年元月份开始生产。全体职工在复工建厂的艰巨工作中，发挥了创造性，表现了对人民事业的无限忠诚。现全公司已拥有职工五百余人。
    裕民实业公司及其所属之各工厂，一年来生产成绩是很大的。对军需及市民生产生活资料的调剂上起了相当大的作用。在匪军两次准备偷袭之情况下，面粉厂前后十一个月共出面粉一五三○九三袋，其中供给该市工人市民面粉一一四八○二袋，另代供应局磨军面一部。制油厂共生产毛油及卫生油二八二七三斤。机器厂开工仅五个月，除制造六批机器零件供给与修配本厂及公司各工厂生产工具外，还制成较大的元车床十二架，专用机器一百四十架，供给了本市及冀中的公营工厂使用。化学厂由五月至十月供给渤海区及本市某工厂甘油二万七千斤。共生产肥皂及香皂二七九二四四条（香皂以块计），本市消售占三六○○○多条。七月间虽然油及洋碱价格暴涨，军民需用的肥皂同样保证了低价供给。染织布厂区白市布、各色条布面袋布、蚊帐布共八○二八余匹。各厂生产数字是逐月增加的，如化学工厂六月生产甘油一千五百斤，七月产五千斤，九月则提到九千斤。织布厂七月产布五百匹，八月提高到八百匹。面粉厂从前月产面粉一万八千袋，八月则达近二万三千袋。尤其是十月下旬，石市备战期间物价一度高涨，影响工人市民生活，该公司为平抑物价，抛售面价一万四千余袋，占当时全市供给量百分之七十。在当时市民争购粮面，民营电磨业大部停工，投机商人疯狂趁机抬高物价的情况下，面粉价格保持在每袋三万元左右。这就粉碎了奸商投机阴谋，稳定了物价。发挥了公营经济在市场上的领导作用。（柏青）
