　　All Teachers and Students of North China University
  　Warmly Celebrate Comrade Wu Yuzhang's Birthday
    The Revolutionary Elder is Energetic and Tireless in Teaching
    [Report from this newspaper] On December 30th, all teachers and students of North China University celebrated the 70th birthday of Comrade Wu Yuzhang, the revolutionary elder and president of the university. Comrade Wu Yuzhang's forty years of arduous struggle for the revolution are inseparable from the Chinese people's history of seeking liberation. As the People's Liberation Army sweeps away the counter-revolutionaries, who can no longer raise their heads, and as the revolution approaches its final victory nationwide, celebrating Wu Lao's birthday is not only a joy for all teachers and students of Huabei University and every member of the Chinese Communist Party, but also a joy for every Chinese person in China.
    The celebration was held in a hall filled with various elaborately crafted congratulatory gifts and inscriptions. Hundreds of guests from various places, all cadres of the university, and student representatives attended. Men and women, young and old, gathered harmoniously in this revolutionary big family, everyone happy and excited, looking at this revolutionary elder with infinite love and respect. At the meeting, the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was respectfully read, Chairman Cheng Fangwu introduced Wu Lao's revolutionary life, and representatives of teachers and students of the school and guests from various places gave congratulatory speeches to celebrate Wu Lao's birthday. When the active members of the Communist Youth League presented congratulatory messages and a group of innocent children from the nursery school presented flowers to Wu Lao, Wu Lao looked at these revolutionary sons and daughters and recalled his revolutionary life, feeling particularly happy and excited. The seventy-year-old Wu Lao is still energetic and working intensely. He gets up at seven o'clock every day, starts working at nine o'clock, and works until nine o'clock in the evening, except for short breaks before and after meals. Teachers and students of Huabei University often talk about the old man's tireless and patient guidance. Even at this birthday celebration, he did not relax the opportunity to educate, and he gave everyone a lecture of great revolutionary significance. He used the iron law of historical development and his own revolutionary experience to tell everyone: "One hundred years ago, Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto pointed out the road for the wheels of history to move forward. Throughout history, many tyrannical rulers have suffered miserable defeats in the face of the people. The US-Chiang reactionaries will suffer even more miserable defeats..."
    In his report, Chairman Cheng Fangwu called on everyone to learn from Wu Lao's high revolutionary enthusiasm, his infinite loyalty to the revolution, his tireless teaching, and his spirit of being open to learning. Comrade Fan Wenlan pointed out in his speech that celebrating Wu Lao's birthday is a great joy for all Chinese people. The Chinese people could not hold their heads high under thousands of years of feudal rule and a hundred years of imperialist oppression. Now, the year of decisive victory between revolution and counter-revolution has arrived, and the year approaching final victory has arrived. The Chinese people's history of seeking liberation is inseparable from Wu Lao's history. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Wu Lao has participated in the forefront of every revolutionary movement. Wu Lao has always kept pace with the people, with history, and with every revolution, constantly moving forward. Comrade Fan Wenlan called on all teachers and students to learn from Wu Lao's spirit of progress and to be vigilant not to lag behind or fall out of the revolutionary ranks. Professor Li Helin, who participated in the celebration, said in his speech that although he is not a member of the Communist Party, he is not only happy but also proud to celebrate Wu Lao's birthday. He said that Wu Lao is not only a revolutionary and statesman but also a revolutionary educator, a reformer and advocate of the new written language.
    The birthday celebration lasted from one o'clock in the afternoon to four o'clock. An evening gala was held in the evening to celebrate.

　　华北大学全体师生
  　热烈庆祝吴玉章同志寿辰
    革命老人精神健旺诲人不倦
    【本报讯】华北大学全体师生于十二月三十日，为革命老人吴校长玉章同志庆祝七十大寿。吴玉章同志四十年来为革命艰苦斗争的历史，是和中国人民求解放的历史分不开的。当人民解放军以排山倒海之势把反革命打得已不能抬头，当革命将在全国范围内最后胜利的时候，为吴老祝寿，不仅是华大全体师生及中国共产党每个党员的欢喜，也是全中国每一个中国人民的欢喜。
    庆祝会在满布各种精心制作的贺品、祝词的寿堂中举行。到会有各地来宾、校内全体干部、学生代表共数百人。男女老少融融一堂，在此革命大家庭中，人人欢喜兴奋，望着这位革命老人无限敬爱。会上恭读了中共中央的贺电，主席成仿吾同志介绍了吴老的革命生活，并有本校师生代表及各地来宾祝贺及讲话，为吴老祝寿。当活跃的青年团员献祝词及托儿所一群天真的孩子给吴老献花时，吴老望着这些革命儿女，回想他革命的一生，分外欢喜和兴奋。七十岁的吴老现仍精神健旺，紧张工作，他每天七点钟起床，九点开始工作，除吃饭前后稍事休息外，一直工作到晚九点。华大师生平时常谈起这位老人诲人不倦，循循善诱的精神。就是在这个祝寿会上也未放松教育的机会，他向大家作了一次富有极大革命意义的讲演。他以历史发展底铁的规律及自己一生的革命经验，向大家说着：“一百年前马克思和恩格斯所著的共产党宣言，指明历史车轮前进的道路，历史上多少暴君统治者都在人民面前遭到了惨败，美蒋反动派将败得更惨……。”
    主席成仿吾同志在报告中号召大家学习吴老之高度的革命热情，对革命之无限忠诚、诲人不倦及虚心好学的精神。范文澜同志在讲话中指出，为吴老祝寿，是全中国人民的皆大欢喜。中国人民在数千年的封建统治及一百年的帝国主义压迫之下抬不起头来，而现在已到了革命与反革命决胜负的一年，已到了临近最后胜利的一年，中国人民求解放的历史和吴老的历史是分不开的，吴老自甲午以来，没有一次革命运动不是参加在最前列。吴老始终随着人民，随着历史，随着每次革命，不断前进。范文澜同志号召所有师生学习吴老这种前进的精神，要警惕自己不要在革命队伍中落伍掉队。参加庆祝的李何林教授在讲话时说他虽不是一个共产党员，但对吴老的祝寿不仅欢喜而且骄傲。他说吴老不仅是革命家、政治家，而且是革命的教育家和新文字改革者和提倡者。
    祝寿会自下午一点进行到四点，晚间并举行庆祝晚会。
