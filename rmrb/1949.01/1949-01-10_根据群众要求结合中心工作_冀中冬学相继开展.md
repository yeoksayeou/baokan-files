Jizhong Electric Report: Jizhong winter school movements are being launched and restored in various places. According to the statistics of the Eighth Administrative Office, the average number of villages with schools opened in the entire district accounts for about 15 percent. In Renqiu, the number of villages with schools opened accounts for about 40 percent of all villages in the county. Statistics from five districts in Dingxian and three districts in Shenxian show that more than 80 villages have opened schools, and most villages in the fifth district and urban area of Shenxian have started classes. In Anping County, 138 out of 205 villages have opened schools. Generally, male students account for 60 to 70 percent, and young adults are the absolute majority. In most villages where schools have opened, learning is organized according to the needs of the masses. In villages that are completing land reform and Party rectification, policy education is conducted according to the needs of the masses. For example, after raising their class consciousness, the masses in Xingxian Village, Anping, found one landlord family that had been missed during the process of correcting class status, and three wealthy middle peasant families that had been wrongly classified as rich peasants. Appropriate confiscation and compensation were made again. Yuan Luodai, a middle peasant in Nanduzhuang, Shenxian, said after listening to the land policy: "It's all the truth, and now I have a bottom line." Anping Beimanzheng is combining the issuance of land certificates with winter school education, and the level of mass awareness has been significantly improved. They have consciously resolved more than 50 land issues, large and small. The masses have experienced the benefits of winter schools, and the number of students has greatly increased. In Nanduzhuang, Shenxian, the number of students has increased from 28 to 60, and in Xingxian Village, Anping, from 60 to more than 90. In villages with sideline production such as pottery kilns and mat weaving, such as Liutun, Qianliuying, Houzhangzhuang, and Raoyang Wodi villages in Anping, winter school groups are established in the workers' workshops, combining production, and driving the surrounding neighbors to participate in production and learning. According to their needs, winter schools focus on learning bookkeeping, identifying fake banknotes, writing letters, and using abacuses. Wangliuzhuang also implemented the "little teacher" system. More than 20 villages in Dingxian, such as Wangcun and Xiaoxizhang, have combined with spinning groups, spinning while learning to read. On market days, one person goes to the market to exchange thread for everyone, while others participate in production and learning. The masses in Xiaoxizhang and other villages have also formulated covenants such as "study hard, be on time for school." Cadres and the masses in many villages discussed and hired winter school teachers, changing the past bad practice of cadres doing everything themselves.

At the beginning of the work, various counties followed the instructions of the Jizhong Administrative Office on carrying out the winter school movement and successively held winter school teacher training classes, training one to four winter school cadres from each village. Jinghai, Xianjiao, Anguo, Wuqiang, and Shenxian counties trained a total of 989 teachers. At the beginning of the training, many ideological situations were discovered. For example, many teachers in Anguo County who were being trained had no confidence in carrying out winter schools and showed a perfunctory attitude. Ji Xiaosan from Liugezhuang said: "It's useless to be trained, no one will help me when I return to the village." Some said: "It's always like this every year, starting with a bang and ending with a whimper, it won't work." Village cadres in the fifteenth district of Xianxian were afraid of delaying production and said: "What about production then?" It was generally believed that it would not work to follow the opinions of the masses, but the higher authorities did not allow compulsory orders, and it would offend people. It was also thought that the masses were backward and unwilling to attend. It was immediately pointed out that the masses were not unwilling to learn, but because of past compulsory orders and delays in production. The importance of this year's winter school movement to completing the central task was also pointed out. The typical Dongcun winter school, which has been maintained for three years, was introduced. (How to persevere? Are there any coercive practices? Worth checking and researching - Editor) Xianxian also introduced the method of Dongzhaizhuang winter school taking the mass line at the conference. As a result, most of the cadres improved their ideological understanding and strengthened their confidence.

In addition, some village cadres who were trained failed to promptly organize after returning to the village, and some still emphasized large collectives. Or they thought that production was busy and there was no time to go to winter school. Some villages did not closely integrate with the central tasks such as autumn collection and support for the front, but only focused on the central task in isolation. For example, Xianjiao mechanically divided stages and separately organized a winter sports office to specialize in the winter school movement, while cadres from other departments specialized in central work; the masses had no time to organize winter schools, and education cadres could not intervene. As a result, the winter school failed to develop and work suffered. These practices should be corrected.

### 根据群众要求结合中心工作　冀中冬学相继开展

　　根据群众要求结合中心工作
  　冀中冬学相继开展
    【冀中电】冀中各地的冬校运动，正相继开展与恢复。据八专署统计，全分区开校村数平均约占百分之十五，任邱开校村庄约占全县村的百分之四十，定县五个区与深县三个区统计：八十余村已开校，深县五区、市区大部村庄开课。安平全县二百零五村，其中一百卅八村开校。一般男学员占百分之六十至七十；青壮年占绝对多数。在已开学的大部村庄，均根据群众要求组织学习。在进行结束土改、整党村庄，根据群众要求，进行政策教育。如安平兴贤村群众在提高阶级觉悟以后、订正成份时，查出漏斗地主一户、富裕中农错定为富农的三户，重又作到了适当的没收和补偿。深县南杜庄中农袁洛带听了土地政策说：“净是老实话，这心里可有了底了。”安平北满正结合发土地证，进行冬学教育，群众觉悟程序显著提高，他们自觉的解决了大小土地问题五十余件。群众体验到冬校的好处，学员大见增多，深县南杜庄由廿八人增到六十人，安平兴贤村由六十人增到九十多人。在有盆窑、编席等副业生产的村庄，如安平刘屯、前刘营、后张庄、饶阳窝堤等村，即结合生产，在工人作坊场所，成立冬学小组，带动了周围邻居群众，参加生产与学习。冬学根据他们要求，以记帐、识别假票、写信、打珠算等为学习内容。王刘庄并施用“小先生”制。定县王村、小西张等二十余村妇女，与纺线组结合起来，一面纺线，一面识字；到集日时，一个人去赶集给大家换线，别人即参加生产与学习。小西张等村群众，并自订了“认真学习，按时到校”等公约。不少村庄干部与群众讨论着聘请了冬校教员，转变了过去干部包办的坏作风。
    工作开展之初，各县曾按照冀中行署开展冬校运动的指示，相继召开了冬校教师训练班，训练了各村的冬学干部一至四人。静海、献交、安国、武强、深县等五县，共训练教员九百八十九人。在训练开始特发现很多思想情况，如安国县受训的教员很多是对开展冬学没有信心，表现着支应态度。刘各庄纪小三说：“受训白受，回了村也没有人帮助着干。”有的说：“每年都是闹这么一回，虎头蛇尾，干不起来。”献县十五区村干部怕耽误生产说：“这还生产什么？”一般认为按群众意见，办不起来，强迫命令上级又不许，还得罪人。又认为群众落后，不愿意上。当即指出，群众不是不愿学习，是因为过去强迫命令、耽误生产。并指示今年冬学运动对完成中心工作的重要性。并将坚持三年的门东村典型冬校，作了介绍。（怎样坚持的？是否有强制作法？值得检查研究——编者）献县在大会上也介绍了东翟庄冬校走群众路线的办法。如此，干部大部分都提高了思想认识，信心加强起来。
    另有的村庄受训干部回村以后，未能及时抓紧进行组织，有些仍强调大集体。或认为生产忙，没空上冬校。有些村未与秋征、支前等中心工作取得密切结合，而单一突击中心任务。如献交机械的划分阶段，并单独的组织了冬运办公室，专搞冬学运动，其他部门干部则专作中心工作；群众无空组织冬学，教育干部也插不下手去。致使冬学未能开展起来，工作受了损失。这种种作法应纠正。
