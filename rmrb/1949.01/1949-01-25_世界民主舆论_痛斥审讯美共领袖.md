　　World Democratic Public Opinion
  　Vehemently Condemns the Trial of US Communist Leaders
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】 Reports from various sources: The illegal trial of US Communist leaders by the American reactionaries has ignited the righteous anger of progressive humanity worldwide. 法其人道报 [Likely L'Humanité, needs confirmation] commented: "Since the Communist Manifesto appeared in the United States a hundred years ago, no one has thought of punishing people for reading and disseminating the book by law. They are now trying twelve Communist leaders because they want to use this trial as a tool of war. This is a trial of the freedom of the American people, because the exercise of this freedom hinders the imperialist bloc. This is a trial of all American democrats, of Wallace, of millions of voters who oppose war, oppose racial discrimination, and fight for equal civil rights." The Soviet newspaper Izvestia published Zhivnov's [needs romanization and confirmation] essay stating: The trial of the twelve US Communist leaders proves that American courts are tools to suppress the democratic rights of the people. American courts are carrying out their offensive against the progressive movement by acting as tame tools of the monopoly groups. Dutch progressives sent a declaration to the US Embassy, demanding the release of the twelve US Communist leaders. The Polish legal profession issued an open letter to Truman, protesting that this trial violates basic human rights and democratic traditions.

　　世界民主舆论
  　痛斥审讯美共领袖
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：美国反动派对美共领袖的非法审讯，燃起了世界进步人类正义的怒火。法其人道报评称：“自从共产党宣言在美国出现一百年以来，还没有人认为可以用法律来处罚阅读与散布该书的人。他们现在来审讯十二位共产党领袖，是因为他们想要利用这次审讯作为战争的工具。这是对美国人民自由的审讯，因为这种自由的行使妨碍着帝国主义集团。这是对美国一切民主分子，对华莱士、对千百万为反对战争、反对种族歧视、争取公民权平等的选民的审讯。”苏联消息报刊出日维诺夫的论文称：对美共十二位领袖的审讯，证明美国法庭是压制人民民主权利的工具。美国法庭正为充当垄断集团的驯服工具而进行其对进步运动的攻势。荷兰进步人士以宣言寄交美大使馆，要求释放美共十二位领袖。波兰律师界特发表致杜鲁门的公开信，抗议这一审讯侵犯了基本人权和民主传统。
