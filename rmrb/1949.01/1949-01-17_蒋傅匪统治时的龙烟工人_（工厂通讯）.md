　　Although it is already deep winter, the warm sunshine feels like spring on the body.

　　December 14th—the morning of the eighth day after the liberation of Xuanhua, the reporter went from the north gate of the ancient city of Xuanhua along the wide road to the nationally famous Longyan Iron Mine. Turning a mountain bend, one can see rows of low cave dwellings in the distance, which are the accommodations for the workers of the Yantongshan mine, one of the Longyan mines.

　　Some workers and their families were sitting outside the dormitory. When the reporter explained the purpose of their visit, they immediately surrounded us excitedly and enthusiastically, recounting all the pain they had suffered in the past two years and their longing for the People's Liberation Army. Many workers' eyes turned red when they talked about the freedom and happiness they had under the Communist Party in 1946. A worker, Liu Shusheng, held my hand tightly for a long time and couldn't speak.

　　This mine was liberated from the Japanese invaders by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army in September 1945. The workers were transformed from slaves into the masters of the mine, living a happy and free life. In October 1946, after our army voluntarily withdrew from Zhangxuan, it fell into the clutches of the Fu bandits. From the workers' sorrowful and indignant accusations, we learned that this beautiful mine had once again been ruined beyond recognition by the Fu bandits.

　　The Chiang Kai-shek/Fu Zuoyi bandits' rule over the workers was unprecedentedly barbaric and cruel. They were not treated as human beings at all, and were not issued "National Identity Cards," and were not allowed to enter the city gates. A skilled worker could only earn three or four jin of rice a day, while an ordinary worker only earned two or three jin, which was not enough to fill his own stomach, let alone support his family. Many workers ate wild vegetables because they had no food, and their bodies swelled up. They would faint in the yard after walking a few steps, and they would feel dizzy and weak from hunger after working in the mine pit for a while. Li Binglin had not eaten a meal of millet in two years, and had not lit a lamp once. The workers went down the mine hungry, while the women led their children to dig wild vegetables, cut green grass, or sift coal cinders from the coal ash piles to exchange for some money to buy two jin of sorghum flour and cook it into a paste with some wild vegetables. Fifteen or sixteen households had to beg on the streets every day. When they were sick and unable to work, they were fired. Li Qunchang stretched out his hands and said, "My hands were frostbitten from working, but I had to endure the pain to work. Later, they rotted and my fingernails fell off. When I couldn't work anymore and wanted to take a few days off to recover, not only was I not allowed, but I was also fired, and my family has been living by begging ever since." In order to keep the workers tied to the mine and not allow them to rest, the mine established a cruel processing system, which was to add two days' wages at the end of the month for working a full month. However, if you took a day off, not only would you have your wages deducted for that day, but also the two processing days would be canceled. As a result, the workers could not leave the mine for a moment, and did not even have time to go out to buy something. Let the manager Huang Xinghua find a way to buy some food, but Huang Xinghua brought the moldy sorghum that he fed his horses, and there was still one-third of soil in it. It cost three yuan per斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry volume) in the market (puppet gold yuan), but he wanted three yuan and fifty cents, and he had to pay in cash.

　　At this time, the reporter asked to see their dormitory. A worker said, "It's really unbearable to see, it's not like it used to be; when the People's Liberation Army was here, not only did we eat our fill and dress warmly, but we also had some savings every month. Now everything is sold out, and we've had a lot of famines." Another worker added, "When the People's Liberation Army left, I had a pig, two sheep, four small pieces of cloth, one hundred jin of rice, and fifty jin of flour, but now it's all gone!" Indeed, they are now extremely poor. In each dark little cave dwelling, besides a broken mat and a tattered quilt on the kang (a heated brick bed), a small pot, and some scattered utensils, you can't see anything else. When we walked to another cave dwelling, there were three children eating around a broken bowl.

　　"How old are you?" a comrade asked a little girl.

　　"Six years old."

　　"What's your name?"

　　"My name is Xiaonu (Little Slave)."

　　"My name is Xiaozhuzi (Little Pillar), I'm four years old," said the youngest child.

　　"Where did your mother go?"

　　"She went begging." Xiaonu replied.

　　"When will she be back?"

　　"She won't be back until it's dark."

　　"What are you eating?"

　　"Yams."

　　I saw that there were some rotten yams and some grains of rice in the broken bowl.

　　"Are you full?"

　　"Yes, I'm full."

　　"What about your mother?"

　　"She's also full."

　　"Your mother is not full, she saved it all for you to eat." At this time, some workers and their families who came with us said. The comrade picked up Xiaonu and asked her if she was afraid of the People's Liberation Army. She said without hesitation, "No, I'm not afraid!" The people next to her said, "If the 'Nationalist Army' came, she would have been scared to run and hide and cry. The adults talk about the People's Liberation Army every day, so the children are not afraid anymore." The workers also told us, "Xiaonu's family was so poor that they had no choice. They used a little rice to give her away as a child bride, but that family was also very poor, and later the child was so hungry that she couldn't walk. Half a month ago, her father saw her and brought her back." I accidentally looked up and saw that a woman's eyes were already full of tears. When we came out, someone told us that Xiaonu and Xiaozhuzi were from the same family, and that the older one, Xiaorong, was from another family.

　　"Alas! How have you managed to survive these past two years?" the reporter asked. Worker Zhou Fuwen said, "To be honest, we don't even know how we managed to survive. But every family went to the coal pile to sift coal. If it weren't for that pile of coal cinders, people would have all starved to death. In addition, although the workers are poor, they can help each other. When Wang Bingkui was sick and had nothing to eat, Zhang Zhijun sent him the only six jin of rice he had. If the workers didn't have mutual assistance, they might have all scattered long ago."

　　Yang Shaoming, who used to be a teacher at the mine and later became a miner under the oppression of the Fu bandits, continued, "Really, we have suffered all kinds of hardships in the past two years, and our eyes have been worn out. Although we are living such a life, everyone has a hope, that is, the Communist Party will come soon. If there were no Communist Party, maybe we wouldn't be alive today. Whenever we were so poor that we couldn't do anything, and so worried that we couldn't do anything, as long as we thought of the Communist Party, we would feel like we had a way to live: 'The Communist Party will come back, let's just wait!' At that time, we were looking forward to the People's Liberation Army every day."

　　Another worker said, "At that time, when we were working in the mine, when we thought of the life we had when the People's Liberation Army was here and the suffering we are going through now, we would throw our pickaxes far away and didn't want to work anymore."

　　But the workers were not simply reminiscing and waiting for the People's Liberation Army. When the Fu bandits arrested worker Wang Liheng and others who were dissatisfied with him on the charge of "collaborating with the communists," the resistance never stopped. They used various methods to carry out strikes and slowdowns, and won the victory of taking one day off every week. In April of this year, because the mine refused the workers' request for wage increases, they refused to receive their wages, and the stalemate lasted for four or five days. Especially under the united strength of the workers, no one was captured by the Fu bandits to become soldiers. Liu Shaoming said, "The police captain of the Daxiang township of Liujiayao received an order from his superiors to go to Yantongshan to capture soldiers, but he was afraid that the workers would beat him, so he didn't dare to come and fled in the middle of the night."

　　This time, Xuanhua was liberated again, and the workers automatically organized a self-defense force to actively protect their mines and tools, and did not suffer any losses. They also told reporters, "The disasters of the past two years were entirely given by the Fu bandit Zuo Yi. We will use all our strength to actively produce, assist the People's Liberation Army in overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek/Fu Zuoyi bandits, and build a new China."

　　蒋傅匪统治时的龙烟工人
    （工厂通讯）
    虽然已经是深冬了，但煦煦的阳光照在身上却有着春天的感觉。
    十二月十四日——宣化解放后的第八天的上午，记者从古老的宣化城的北门沿着宽阔的大路到著名全国的龙烟铁矿去。拐过一个山弯，远远的就可以看到一排排低矮的小窑洞，那便是龙烟矿中的一个场——烟筒山矿场工人的住宿处。
    宿舍的外面坐着一些工人和工人家属，当记者说明来意后，立即兴奋而热烈的围拢我们，叙述起他们这两年来所有的痛苦和对解放军盼望的情形，谈到一九四六年共产党在时的自由幸福，许多工友的眼圈红起来，一个工人刘树生紧紧的握住我的手许久许久说不出话来。
    这座矿山，曾在一九四五年的九月，被中国共产党和解放军从日寇手中解放出来，工人们由奴隶变成了矿山的主人，过着幸福自由的生活。一九四六年十月，我军主动撤离张宣后，遂陷入傅匪的魔手。从工人们的悲愤的控诉中，我们了解到这座美丽的矿山，又曾被傅匪糟踏得不象样子了。
    蒋傅匪对工人的统治是空前的野蛮和残暴，根本不当人看待，不发给“国民证”，不许可进城门。一个技术工人每天只能挣到三四斤米的工资，一个普通工人则只有二三斤米，还不够填饱自己一个人的肚子，当然谈不到养活家属。许多工人因没粮食，吃野菜吃的浑身肿起来，走不了几步便晕倒在院中，到矿坑做不了一会活，便饿得头昏腿软。李炳琳两年没吃过一顿小米饭，没点过一回灯。工人们饿着肚子下矿，女人们则领着孩子去刨野菜，割青草，或者是到煤灰堆上筛煤核，换回一些钱来，买两斤高粱面加上些野菜熬糊糊，并有十五六户每天到街上去要饭吃。有了病不能工作的时候，便遭到解雇。李群昌伸出他的两只手说：“我这两只手因做工冻坏了，仍得忍着疼痛去做工，后来烂得把指甲都烂掉了，实在不能工作，想请几天假养养时，不只不准，结果还被开除出来，一家子一直仗着要饭生活。”矿方为了把工人捆在矿山上一会也不休停，订出了残酷的加工制，就是做一个整月的工，到月底给增加两天的工资。但是，若请一天假的话，不只要扣请假那一天的工资，连两个加工也便取消了。这样一来，工人们便一会也不能离开矿山，连出外买一下东西的时间都没有。让经理黄兴华给想办法买一些粮食，但黄兴华却把他喂马的霉高粱弄了来，并且还有三分之一的土，在市场上每斗三元钱（伪金圆券），他的却要三块五，并且还得现钱。
    这时记者要求到他们的宿舍看一下，一个工人说：“实在见不得人了，比不得从前了；过去解放军在这的时候，不只吃的饱穿的暖，每月还有些积蓄，现在什么全卖光了，还闹了好些饥荒。”另一个工人接着说：“解放军走的那时候，我还养着一个猪、两只羊、存着四个小布、一百斤米、五十斤面，现在早他妈光了！”真的，现在他们真是穷苦到极点了，每一个黑黝黝的小窑洞中，除了炕上一张破席和一条破烂的棉被，一个小锅和一些零星用具外，你再也看不到有什么东西。当走到另一间窑洞时，有三个小孩子正在围着一个破碗吃饭。
    “你几岁了？”一个同志问一个小女孩。
    “六岁了。”
    “你叫什么名字？”
    “叫小奴。”
    “我叫小柱子，四岁了。”另一个最小的孩子也说了。
    “你妈干什么去了？”
    “要饭去了。”小奴答。
    “什么时候回来？”
    “天黑了才回来。”
    “你吃的什么？”
    “山药。”
    我看到那个破碗里还有些黑烂的山药和一些米粒。
    “你吃的饱吗？”
    “吃的饱。”
    “你妈呢？”
    “也吃的饱。”
    “你妈吃不饱，全省给你吃了。”这时同来的一些工人和工人家属说。那个同志把小奴抱起来，问她怕不怕解放军。她毫不犹豫的说；“不怕！”旁边的人说：“若是‘国军’来了，早就吓得乱跑乱钻的哭起来了。大人们天天谈论着解放军，孩子们也不怕了。”工人们并告诉我们：“小奴家曾经穷的没办法了。使了一点米，把她童养给人家，那家也很穷，后来把个孩子饿得走不动了；半月前她爸爸看见了，才把她接回来。”我偶然抬起头来，看见一个女人的眼中已满满的含了一眶泪水。我们出来时，一个人告诉我们，小奴与小柱子是一家的，那一个大些的小蓉是另一家的。
    “唉！这两年来你们是怎样活过来的啊？”记者问。工人周福文说：“说起来，我们也简直不知道是怎样活过来的。不过每一家都到煤堆上筛煤，若不是有那堆煤核，人们就全饿死了。另外，工人们虽然穷，但能够互助，王秉奎病了没吃的，张志钧把仅有的六斤米给他送了去，工人们若不是有互助，也许早就东的东、西的西早散了。”
    曾在矿上当教员，后在傅匪压榨下当矿工的杨少明接着说：“真是，这两年我们的苦受尽了，眼也望穿了，虽然过着这样的生活，但人人都怀着一个希望，那就是共产党赶快来，假如没有共产党也许我们不会活到今天，每当我们穷得没法，愁的没法的时候，只要一想起共产党来，便又觉得有了活头：‘共产党会回来的，还是等待着吧！’那时我们天天盼着解放军。”
    另一个工人说：“那时我们在矿做工，一想到解放军在时的生活和现在的痛苦，便把镐扔的远远的，就不想干了。”
    但是工人们并不是单纯的怀念和等待解放军，当傅匪用“通匪”的罪名逮捕对他不满的工人王力珩等时，反抗便一刻也没有停止，他们以各种办法，进行停工、怠工、并争取到每礼拜休假一天的胜利。今年四月，因矿方拒绝工人增资的要求而拒绝领受工资，相持达四五天之久。特别是在工人们团结的力量下，没有一个人被傅匪抓了兵。刘少明说：“刘家窑子大乡的保警队长接到上级的命令，叫他到烟筒山抓兵，因惧怕工人揍他不敢来，而深夜逃走。”
    这次宣化重获解放，工人们自动的组织起自卫队，积极保护自己的矿山和工具，没受到任何损失。他们并向记者表示：“这两年的灾难，完全是傅匪作义所给予的，我们要用一切的力量，积极生产，协助解放军打倒蒋傅匪，建设新中国。”
