Military Officers' Families Under Jiang and Fu Bandits' "Warm Care"

　　The retreat of Fu bandit military officers' families from Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua was a conspiracy in Fu Zuoyi's complete and utter collapse. Several captured 35th Army officers, when talking about this matter, shook their heads in sorrow. In mid-November, when the "North China剿总 (Suppression General Headquarters)" decided on the operational policy of "concentrating main forces," the first to be "concentrated" were not the troops, but the tens of thousands of military officers' families in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. This was a vicious tactic used by Fu bandit in the final, irretrievable collapse to control officers and regiment troops. Without any prior notice to the officers, an emergency order was issued to the families in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, ordering them to "receive the order today and depart tomorrow." They were all forced to move to Tianjin. The families were struck by the news of the retreat like a bolt from the blue—panic-stricken and at a loss. That night, there was a bargain basement sale, with tables, chairs, benches, basins, and utensils, everything that could not be taken being put up for sale, but amidst the chaos of fleeing, no matter how nicely they asked, no one would buy them, and they could only watch helplessly. The next day, the adjutant of the family group urged them to go to the station on time. They tearfully gathered the things they wanted to take and concentrated them at the station. In this situation, rickshaw fares suddenly soared, and it was not easy to hire one even with a lot of money. Some discounted the things they couldn't pull, even offering a thousand catties of coal, but no one was willing to pull them. Many carried them on their backs, supporting the old and leading the young to the station. The things were piled up like a big junk shop, with high tables, sofas, iron stoves, and bellows piled up like mountains. Some were moved but not transported, and were just left haphazardly at the station. As soon as the women and children arrived at the station, they scrambled to get on the train. Those in front desperately climbed onto the train, and those behind desperately squeezed in. Wang Heqing, the captured commander of the 301st Regiment, said: I don't know how many people cursed and fought in the scramble to get on the train. In Xuanhua, Li Zhong, a major general of the Provisional 3rd Army, beat an adjutant named Wang Junjie until his head was bleeding in order to force the families onto the train. Wang Wen's mother, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 27th Division, and his wife, who had not yet completed her month of postpartum confinement, panicked when they saw the crowd, grabbed their suitcases and packages, and climbed onto the train empty-handed. After arriving in Beiping, they cried to acquaintances that their belongings were lost. Many people lost their packages and luggage. The Zhangjiakou families cried and screamed as they climbed onto the train, but it took a full two days and two nights before the train started. The weather in Zhangjiakou in November, not to mention at night, was freezing even during the day, but they were afraid to get off the train even if they were freezing to death, because whoever left would never find a seat again. Women and children cried and screamed on the open carriage for two days and two nights. Two days later, the train finally started. Many more problems arose along the way, stopping and starting, stopping and starting, cold and hungry all the way, and they finally made it to Fengtai. At that time, the 35th Army was still stationed in Fengtai, and the women burst into tears when they saw their husbands and sons. Guo Jiutong, the commander of the 303rd Regiment, whose old mother in her sixties or seventies was hungry for two days and two nights on the road, fell ill as soon as she arrived in Fengtai and cried to Guo, "If I had known it would be like this, I would rather die than come with you." Yang Xinwu, the battalion commander of the 3rd Regiment of the New 31st Division, had a child who was so cold and hungry that he died as soon as he arrived in Beiping. Fu Zuoyi dragged the families to Tianjin, but the houses were not settled, and those wives and children who had suffered wind and cold all the way froze for another night at Tianjin Station. Only the next day were they led to temples, schools, and large fields to settle down. Dozens of families were crowded into houses without doors or windows, and no one cared if they froze to death. Some, because they could not live, wandered to Beiping and other places. Fu Zuoyi, who used families as collateral to force his subordinates to sell their lives for him, pretended to be compassionate and said that this was his "warm care." But those who were "cared for" felt that Fu's "heart" was indeed a little too "warm." There is a saying circulating in the Fu army, "Weeping in the mourning hall in front, entering the bridal chamber in the back," which aptly reveals the fate of those who sell their lives for the reactionaries. Several captured officers of the 35th Army said: "Fu Zuoyi is finished, and our wives and children certainly don't need him to 'take care' of them anymore."

　　蒋傅匪“热心照顾”下的军官眷属们
    傅匪军官眷属从张、宣的撤退，是傅作义全部狼狈崩溃中的一个阴谋，被俘的三十五军几个军官谈起这件事，他们都伤心的摇着脑袋。十一月中旬，当“华北剿总”决定“集中主力”的作战方针后，首先“集中”的不是军队，而是张宣上万的军官眷属。这是傅匪在无可挽救的最后崩溃中，用以控制军官统制部队的毒辣手段。事先根本不通知军官，就向张宣眷属团发出紧急命令，要他们“今天得令，明日出发。”一律强迫向天津搬。眷属们听到撤退的消息，真如晴天打霹雳——惊慌不知所措，当天晚上就是一阵贱价大拍卖，桌、椅、板凳、盆、罐用具，凡是不能带走的摆出就卖，但逃风中，说尽好话都没人买，巴巴的看着没法办。第二天眷属团的副官，督促她们按时赶赴车站，她们流着眼泪把要带的东西，纷纷向车站集中，这种情况下人力车价突然上涨，出很多钱也不容易顾到，有的把拉不走的东西折价，甚至出一千斤煤炭都没人愿拉，许多人自己扛着背着，扶老携幼的挨到车站，东西摆的象个大杂货摊，高桌、沙发、铁炉、风箱、堆积如山，有的搬去却没运走，就那样乱七八糟的丢在车站上。女人、孩子一到车站就抢着上车，前边的拚命向车上爬，后边拼命挤，被俘的三零一团团长王和卿说：不知有多少人为了争着上车乱骂乱打起来。在宣化，暂三军少将李忠，为了再逼眷属上车，把一个叫王俊杰的副官打的头破血流。暂廿七师一团团长王文的母亲和产后没满月的妻子，一见人多心慌意乱，提上皮箱包袱，连扯带拉光杆子爬到车上，到北平后见了熟人就哭说他们的东西丢光了。丢包袱行李的多了。张家口眷属，哭着嚷着爬上了车，但整整停了两天两夜才开车。塞外张家口十一月的天气，不要说夜晚，白天也冻的够受，但她们冻死也不敢下车，谁一离开再也就找不到座位。女人孩子哭着叫着在大敞车上冻了两天两夜。两天之后火车总算开动了。路上又出不少的蹩扭，走走停停，停停走走，一路又冷又饿，好容易熬到了丰台，那时三十五军还驻防丰台，女人一见她们的丈夫、儿子，就流泪大哭。三○三团团长郭旧同六七十岁的老娘路上饿了两天两夜到丰台就病倒了，哭着对郭说：“早知是这样，死也不跟你们来。”新三十一师三团营长杨辛武的小孩冻饿得一到北平就死了。傅作义把眷属拉到天津，房子又没着落，那些经过一路风寒的老婆孩子，又在天津车站冻了一夜。第二天才领到大庙、学校、大场去安家，没门没窗的房子里挤着几十家，冻死也没人管，有些因为无法生活，又流落到北平等地。把眷属当抵押而强制下级为其卖命的傅作义，却装出一副慈悲面孔说这是他的“热心照顾”。但被“照顾”的人，却感到傅的“心”确实太“热”了一点。傅军中流传着“前边哭灵堂，后边入洞房”一句话，恰道破了为反动派卖命者的下场。三十五军几个被俘的军官说：“傅作义已经完了，我们的老婆孩子当然用不着他再‘照顾’了。”
