Comrades, Commanders and Fighters on the Front Lines:
    You, in order to completely eliminate the dark rule of the Chiang bandits and to achieve the liberation of all the Chinese people, fear no hardship, carry forward the spirit of perseverance, fight bravely in the North and South, and have liberated many good people and many large cities. When we in the rear hear the news of your victories, we all dance with joy, with indescribable happiness in our hearts.
    Although we are temporarily recuperating in the rear due to our disabilities, under such rapid development of the situation, how we hope to recover our health soon! How great it would be to return to the front and join hands with you, fighting the enemy together!
    Now the New Year has arrived, and we have no good gifts to send you. We would like to extend our highest respect to you on behalf of all the disabled veterans!

　　　　　　　　　　　　Respectfully, from all the disabled veterans of the Second Health Brigade of the North China Military Region.

　　残废员慰问战士恢复健康上前线前线指战员同志们：
    你们为了彻底消灭蒋匪的黑暗统治，求得全中国人民的解放，不怕一切艰难困苦，发扬了百折不挠的精神，奋战南北，解放了许多善良的老百姓和许多大城市。我们在后方一听到你们的胜利消息，大家便都是手舞足蹈的，心里有说不出的高兴。
    我们现在虽然因残废暂在后方休养，但在这样形势飞跃的发展下，如何在希望身体早日恢复健康啊！能重上前方，与你们携手并肩，共同杀敌，该多好！
    现在新年业已来到，我们没有好的礼物送给你们，谨代表全体残废员向你们致崇高的敬礼！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　北狱军区第二健康大队全体残废员谨上。
