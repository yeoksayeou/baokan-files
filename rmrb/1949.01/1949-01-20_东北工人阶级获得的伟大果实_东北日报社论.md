　　The Great Fruit Obtained by the Working Class of Northeast China
　　Northeast Daily Editorial
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th】The Northeast Daily in Shenyang published an editorial before the New Year entitled "The Great Fruit Obtained by the Working Class of Northeast China" regarding the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations" promulgated by the Northeast Administrative Committee. The original text is as follows:
　　On December 27th, the Northeast Administrative Committee promulgated the "Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations," the purpose of which is to "protect the health of workers and staff in public enterprises and alleviate wartime living difficulties." That is, based on the possible conditions during wartime, to provide appropriate material insurance to workers and staff in public enterprises for illness, disability, childbirth, old age, and death. Undoubtedly, this regulation is a historically significant decree, not only a major event in the Northeast Liberated Area but also a major event in all of China. This is the great fruit obtained by the working class through heroic struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. For decades, the Chinese working class has waged countless heroic and outstanding struggles to improve their lives and strive for labor insurance. As early as the summer of 1922, the national workers, under the leadership of the Labor Union Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party, conducted a labor legislation movement, taking the struggle for labor insurance as an important goal. Since then, they have continued to struggle to achieve this goal, and in every National Labor Congress, they have put forward the demand for labor insurance. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government's response to the workers was continuous oppression and destruction, and many outstanding members and leaders of the working class sacrificed themselves for the cause of the liberation of the working class. It was not until today, after the establishment of a people's regime led by the working class, that the demand for the implementation of labor insurance has been realized. This historical fact shows that the reactionary regime of China's landlords and big bourgeoisie is the mortal enemy of the working class – the mortal enemy of all laborers. Only by overthrowing this reactionary regime and establishing a new democratic regime led by the working class, of the broad masses of the people, and anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic-capitalist, can the working class be emancipated and their living conditions be improved and raised. The labor insurance system is the fruit of victory in the struggle of the working class, just as the distribution of land is the fruit of victory for the peasants.
　　From the beginning of the establishment of the Northeast Liberated Area, some labor insurance measures began to be implemented in some public enterprises. However, in the past, the standards were extremely inconsistent among various enterprises, the scope of insurance was relatively small, and the insurance premiums paid to employees were also very low. The provisional labor insurance regulations promulgated by the Northeast Administrative Committee this time have made the implementation of labor insurance a national system for the first time in history. This regulation not only unified the labor insurance standards among various enterprises but also greatly expanded the scope of insurance and increased the labor insurance premiums. Although the proportion of labor insurance funds paid by each enterprise is 3% of the total wage, the actual funds used for labor insurance will exceed this number several times. This is because many insurance matters are directly paid by the enterprises and are not included in the labor insurance fund, such as employees' medical expenses, funeral expenses for employees who die on duty, and salaries during employees' sick leave. This means that even in wartime, the state still makes its best efforts to improve the lives of employees, so that the most difficult problems for employees, such as birth, old age, illness, and death, are provided with a certain degree of insurance.
　　The most complete and perfect labor insurance system in the world is the one implemented in the Soviet Union. It not only completely solves the material security of the working people in times of illness, disability, childbirth, and old age but also creates many large-scale welfare undertakings, such as sanatoriums, convalescent hospitals, cultural palaces, and various children's welfare undertakings for the working people. Our current labor insurance system is, of course, still far from the Soviet labor insurance system, and the latter can only become the goal we strive for in the long term. However, compared with various capitalist countries, especially compared with the Kuomintang-controlled areas, we have incomparable superior characteristics: First, our labor insurance expenses are entirely borne by the state, and employees do not pay a penny themselves. The labor insurance expenses in capitalist countries are all or mostly borne by the employees themselves, deducted from their wages, which in fact becomes a kind of additional tax on employees, a means of increasing the exploitation of the working people. Furthermore, they collect a lot but spend very little, such as in the United States, from 1939 to 1946, workers paid 4.3 billion US dollars, while expenditures were only 800 million US dollars. Second, our labor insurance work is handled by the trade union in cooperation with the administration, and the income and expenditure of the labor insurance fund are supervised and audited by employees. In capitalist countries, it is handled by the government or specialized bureaucratic institutions. These bureaucrats often spend huge sums from the insurance fund to support themselves, or even use it to embezzle and enrich themselves, so that a large amount of workers' hard-earned money enters the pockets of these bureaucrats. Third, our labor insurance coverage includes the most difficult problems in the lives of employees, such as illness, disability, childbirth, and old age. In capitalist countries, before World War II, 41 countries had no old-age insurance and 53 countries had no disability insurance. Fourth, our distribution of labor insurance funds prioritizes employees in key sectors of the national economy, rewards long-term adherence to production posts, rewards special achievements and contributions in production, and takes care of underground miners and chemical workers whose health is harmed, which makes the implementation of labor insurance reasonable. Fifth, we not only calculate the length of service in the enterprise but also calculate the employee's seniority since employment. Many capitalist countries mostly only use the time of service in the enterprise as the standard. All this shows that our labor insurance system is far superior to any capitalist country. This is a fundamentally different characteristic determined by the two different natures of the new democratic country and the capitalist country. As for the Kuomintang government, it only ensures that bureaucratic capital can squeeze workers, and has never implemented any labor insurance system, nor has it ever formulated any labor protection laws. Even the individual industrial sectors (such as post offices, railways, etc.) that had some labor insurance measures were not only incomplete but also a means of intensifying the exploitation of workers, because the labor insurance fund was deducted from employees' wages on a monthly basis. The so-called welfare institutions in various enterprises, such as the welfare department, are particularly fierce in oppressing workers and are most hated by workers. The workers have a clear understanding of the Kuomintang's means of deception and oppression. Only by leading the people of the whole country to completely overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary regime can the working class obtain actual labor insurance and be liberated.
　　The Northeast Public Enterprise Labor Insurance Regulations have been promulgated, but in order to implement them, the administrative management agencies and trade unions of the pilot enterprise departments must first make full preparations. And since the preparation time is only three months, we must start immediately without delay. First of all, the significance and content of the regulations should be explained to all employees so that they can understand them clearly, and they should be mobilized and organized to actively participate in this work. We still lack experience in such a unified and large-scale labor insurance work. Only by implementing the mass line and relying on all employees can we proceed smoothly and achieve due results. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult to achieve by relying on the strength of a few people alone. Secondly, detailed organizational work must be carried out, labor insurance committees and labor insurance fund review committees must be established, and a thorough investigation of the seniority, family circumstances of all employees, and distinguishing between direct relatives and non-direct relatives must be conducted. This is a very complex and heavy task, but it must be done meticulously and accurately to ensure that labor insurance is implemented correctly and reasonably and to avoid certain deviations. Finally, the Northeast Bank has been designated by the Northeast Administrative Committee to be responsible for the collection, custody, and payment of the labor insurance general fund. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions must consult with the Northeast Bank to determine specific methods, investigate the total wages of various enterprises, pay insurance funds as required, and study and put in place the necessary procedures.
　　The Northeast Labor Bureau, as the supervisory body for the implementation of labor insurance, should urge the managers and trade unions of relevant enterprises to make all preparations as scheduled and cooperate with the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions to effectively inspect this work.
　　Our labor insurance work is still in its initial stage, and what is currently being implemented is only a wartime provisional measure. In the future, it should be continuously improved and raised with the overall development of production and the development of industry, and move towards the goal we hope for. The decisive key to improvement and enhancement lies first of all in our working class uniting all democratic classes and striving for the early victory of the People's Liberation War throughout the country; at the same time, we must work hard to develop production, increase national wealth, that is, increase the guarantee of workers' welfare undertakings. The era in which workers were exploited and oppressed is gone forever. We must consolidate our achieved victories with the qualifications of masters, develop our victories, accelerate the overthrow of the Kuomintang reactionary government, accelerate the restoration of production, improve production, and build an independent, free, prosperous, and happy new Northeast and new China.

　　东北工人阶级获得的伟大果实
  　东北日报社论
    【新华社沈阳十日电】此间东北日报于新年前曾就东北行政委员会颁布“东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例”一事，发表了题为“东北工人阶级获得的伟大果实”的社论。原文如下：
    十二月二十七日，东北行政委员会颁布了“东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例”，其目的在于“保护公营企业中工人与职员之健康，减轻共战时生活困难”，即依据战争时期之可能条件，确定对公营企业中工人与职员之疾病、伤残、生育、老死等给以适当物质保险。无疑地，这个条例是一个有历史意义的法令，不仅是东北解放区一件重大事情，也是全中国一件重大事情。这是工人阶级在中国共产党领导下英勇奋斗获得的伟大果实。几十年来，中国工人阶级为改善自己生活，为争取劳动保险，曾进行了无数次英勇卓越的斗争。还在一九二二年的夏季，全国工人即在中国共产党劳动组合书记部的领导下，进行过劳动立法运动，把争取劳动保险作为一个重要目标；此后即不断为达到这个目的而继续奋斗，在每次全国劳动大会中，都提出了劳动保险的要求。但是国民党反动政府对工人的回答，是不断的压迫和摧残，有许多工人阶级的优秀分子和领袖为工人阶级解放事业而牺牲了。直到今天，在建立了工人阶级领导的人民政权后，实施劳动保险的要求才得实现。这个历史事实说明：中国大地主和大资产阶级的反动政权，乃是工人阶级的死敌——一切劳动者的死敌，只有推翻这个反动政权，建立起工人阶级领导的、人民大众的、反帝反封建反官僚资本的新民主主义政权，工人阶级才能获得翻身，生活条件才能得到改善与提高。劳动保险制度，乃是工人阶级奋斗的胜利果实，有如分得土地是农民的胜利果实一样。
    从东北解放区创建之日起，在部分公营企业中就开始实行了一些劳动保险办法。但是，过去各企业之间，标准极不一致，保险范围比较小，付给职工的保险费也很低。此次东北行政委员会所颁布之劳动保险暂行条例，使实施劳动保险在历史上第一次成为国家制度。这一条例不仅统一了各企业之间劳动保险标准，而且大大推广了保险范围，提高了劳动保险费。各企业缴纳之劳动保险金比例数虽为工资总数的百分之三，但实际用于劳动保险的经费，将超过此数数倍。因为许多保险事项是由各企业直接开支而不包括于劳动保险基金之内，如职工之医药费、因公死亡职工之丧葬费、职工伤病休养期间之薪金等。这即是说，即使在战争时间，国家仍尽最大努力来改进职工生活，使职工最感困难的生、老、病、死、苦等问题获得了一定的保险。
    世界上最完善最美满的劳动保险制度是苏联所实行的。它不仅完全解决了劳动人民在疾病、伤残、生育、衰老时候的物质保障，而且创办了许多大规模的福利事业，如劳动人民休养所、疗养院、文化宫以及各种儿童福利事业。我们现在的劳动保险制度比之苏联的劳动保险制度，当然还有很大距离，后者只能成为我们今后长时努力奔求的目标。但是，比之各资本主义国家，特别比之国民党统治区，则我们有了不可比拟的优越特点：第一，我们的劳动保险经费，完全由国家负担，职工自己不纳分文。而资本主义国家的劳动保险经费全部或大部是由职工本身负担，由工资中扣除，实际成为对职工的一种附加税，成为加重剥削劳动人民的手段；并且征收多，支出则极少，如美国从一九三九年至一九四六年工人缴纳四十三万万美元，而支出则只八万万美元。第二，我们的劳动保险事业由工会协同行政办理，劳动保险基金之收支，由职工监督审核；而在资本主义国家，则由政府或专设官僚机构办理，这些官僚常从保险金中支出庞大数字来供养他们，甚至用来贪污自肥，使大量工人血汗入了这些官僚的荷包。第三，我们的劳动保险范围，包括疾病、伤残、生育、老死等职工们生活中最感困难的问题；而资本主义国家在第二次世界大战以前，有四十一个国家没有养老保险，有五十三个国家没有残废保险。第四，我们的劳动保险金的分配，是优待国民经济主要部门职工，奖励长期坚持生产岗位，奖励生产中特殊成绩与贡献，照顾有害健康的下井矿工和化学工人等，这就使得劳动保险实施达到合理。第五，我们不仅计算在本企业服务年限，而且计算职工受雇佣以来的工龄；有许多资本主义国家多半只以在本企业服务的时间为标准。这一切都表明我们的劳动保险制度比任何一个资本主义国家都优越得多，这是新民主主义国家与资本主义国家两种不同性质所决定的根本不同的特点。至于说到国民党政府，则只是以保证官僚资本压榨工人为能事，从来没有实行过什么劳动保险制度，从来没有制定过什么劳动保护法令；就是个别产业部门中（如邮政，铁路等）有过的某些劳动保险办法，不仅残缺不全，而且是加紧对工人剥削的一种手段，因为劳动保险金是从职工工资中按月扣除出来的。而在各企业中办理所谓福利事业的机关如福利科，又都是特别厉害的压榨工人最为工人所痛恨的机关。国民党这种欺骗压榨手段是工人群众认识得清清楚楚了的。工人阶级只有领导全国人民彻底打倒国民党反动政权，才能获得实际的劳动保险，才能获得解放。
    东北公营企业劳动保险条例已经颁布了，但是要贯彻实行，就首先要求试办的各企业部门的行政管理机关与职工会进行充分的准备工作。而准备时间又只有三个月，因此必须立即着手，不容迟延。首先应向全体职工解释，使之清楚了解条例意义和内容，并动员和组织他们积极参加这项工作。我们对如此统一的大规模的劳动保险工作，还缺乏经验，唯有实行群众路线，依靠全体职工，才能顺利进行，收到应有的成绩；否则，只靠少数人的力量是绝难实现的。其次，要进行细致的组织工作，建立劳动保险委员会与劳动保险基金审核委员会，并切实调查全体职工厂龄工龄、家属情况、区分直系亲属和非直系亲属等等。这是十分复杂而繁重的工作，但又必须做到周密准确，才能保证劳动保险实行得正确合理，免除某些偏差。最后，劳动保险总基金之收集、保管、支付等，东北行政委员会已指定东北银行负责，东北职工总会必须与东北银行商定具体办法，调查各企业工资总数，按规定缴纳保险基金，把应有的手续制度研究妥当。
    东北劳动总局为实施劳动保险事业的监督机关，应督促各有关企业的管理人与职工会，如期作好一切准备工作，并协同东北职工总会切实检查这一工作。
    我们的劳动保险事业，还处在初创时期，现在所实行的仅是战时暂行办法，今后应随着总的生产的发展，工业的发展，使之不断改进，不断提高，向我们所希望的目标前进。而改进与提高的决定关键，首先在于我们工人阶级团结各个民主阶层，努力争取人民解放战争在全国范围内早日获得胜利；同时要努力发展生产，增加国家财富，亦即增加工人福利事业的保证。过去工人被剥削被压迫的时代已经一去不复返了，我们一定要以主人翁的资格巩固我们已得的胜利，发展我们的胜利，加速打倒国民党反动政府，加速恢复生产，提高生产，建设独立自由繁荣幸福的新东北与新中国。
