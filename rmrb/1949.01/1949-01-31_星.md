　　Star
    There are many stars of different sizes in the sky. These stars are, in the sky, fireballs and stone balls of different sizes. Some are much larger than the sun, and some are as small as a fist. They all attract each other and rotate in the sky. Since some are so big and some are so small, why do they all look about the same to us? This is due to the relationship between distance. Let's use an analogy: A small stone is only a few steps away from us, and a large stone is half a mile away from us, don't they look about the same size? The stars are the same reason.
    In the sky, the stars we commonly see can be divided into fixed stars, planets, satellites, comets, and meteors.
    Fixed stars can all emit light and heat themselves, and the sun is a fixed star. For the convenience of recognizing them, those that are close to each other are formed into systems, forming constellations. The easiest to recognize in the northern constellations is the Big Dipper, which we call the Big Dipper in China, which is composed of seven stars. The second is the Little Dipper, which consists of four stars. In the place far away from the Big Dipper, there is a constellation shaped like a W, called Cassiopeia. In addition, there is Vega in the Lyra constellation, and Altair in the Aquila constellation.
    Planets are separated from the sun, so it can be said that the sun is the mother of the planets. So far, we know that there are nine planets in the solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.
    Most planets are accompanied by some satellites. Satellites cannot emit light, they can only reflect the light of the sun. Their number is related to the size of the planet. The largest Jupiter and Saturn each have nine satellites, the smaller Uranus has four, and the remaining smaller planets have only two, one, or none. The Earth has only one satellite, the moon.
    Comets, commonly known as "broom stars," are monsters in the sky. They are usually invisible, sometimes in the cold depths of space, and sometimes come very close to the sun. Astronomers believe that the nucleus of a comet is not a solid, but a mixture of dust and gas.
    Meteors are not transformed from the fixed stars in the sky, but are fragments of extremely small celestial bodies, or small celestial bodies formed by the disintegration of comets, wandering in the sky. Sometimes they enter the Earth's gravitational range, and are pulled down by the Earth. It falls to the Earth very quickly, and we often see a meteor falling in the sky, which is a meteor.

　　星
    天空中有许多大大小小的星，这些星在天上都是些大小火团、大小石球。有的大得比太阳还要大多少倍，有的小得只有拳头那么小，他们都互相的拉住在天空里转，既是有的那么大，有的那么小，为什么我们看去全是差不多呢？这是远和近的关系。我们打个比喻：一个小石块离我们只有几步远，一个大石块离我们有半里远，看他们不是差不多大么？星也是这个原因。
    在天空中我们常见的星有恒星、行星、卫星、慧星和流星的分别。
    恒星都是自己能放射出光和热来的，太阳便是一颗恒星。为了认识它们方便起见，就其相近的，各成系统，组成一个个的星座。在北天星座中最易辨认的是大熊星座，我国称做北斗，由七颗星组成。其次是小熊星座，由四颗星组成。和大熊星座遥遥相对的地方，有一个形状如Ｗ的星座，这叫仙后座。另外天琴星座中有织女星，还有属于天鹰星座的牵牛星。
    行星是从太阳那里分出来的，所以可以说太阳是行星的母亲。到目前为止，太阳系里我们所知道的行星有九个，那就是水星、金星、地球、土星、木星、火星、天王星、海王星、冥王星。
    大多数的行星都有一些卫星伴随着，卫星不能发光，只能反射太阳的光。它们的数目和行星大小有关系。最大的木星和土星各有卫星九颗，比较小些的天王星有四颗，其余更小的行星则只有两颗、一颗，或者一颗都没有。地球就只有月亮一颗卫星。
    慧星俗名“扫帚星”，是天空中的怪物，它通常是看不见的，有时在冰冷的空间深处，有时来到与太阳非常接近的地方。天文家都相信慧星的核是不坚实的固体，而是尘埃和气体的混合物。
    流星，并不是天上那些恒星变的，而是一种极小的星体的残片，或者慧星分裂而成的小星体，在天空中游荡，有时进了地球的吸力范围，给地球一拉便掉了下来，它掉向地球时非常迅速，我们常看见天空一道星光下坠，这就是流星。
