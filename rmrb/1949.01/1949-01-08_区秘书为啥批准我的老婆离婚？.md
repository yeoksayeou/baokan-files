　　Why Did the District Secretary Approve My Wife's Divorce?
　　To the Editor, Zhang Zhenhua, Textile Factory, Jinnan Military Region:
　　I have a marital problem that I can't resolve. I am from Qingfeng County, Jilu-Yu Region. Because my grandfather settled in Nanguan, Xingtai City, in the autumn of 1947, I married Liu JIngui, the daughter of Liu Xinde of Nanguan. Before the marriage, I went through the engagement formalities at the Fourth District Office. Three months after the marriage, I was preparing to go south with the Supplementary Regiment, so I left my wife at her mother's home in Xingtai City. Because I was busy with work, I didn't go home or write for five months. This February, Chai Liangsheng and Zhang Yuzhen, residents of her street, and Guo Erni, the women's chairman, fabricated rumors that I had died in Henan. They told my wife, "Many people want to struggle against you. I have a way. Why don't we find you someone else? There is a demobilized soldier who is very close to Secretary Shi in the district. No one dares to struggle against him. What do you think?" They frightened and persuaded her for about ten days, and then Secretary Shi approved the divorce. She then married that demobilized soldier.
　　When I returned from the army, they wouldn't let my wife see me. Secretary Shi in the district tried to persuade me, saying, "Your wife is a broken shoe. We were afraid you wouldn't be able to concentrate at the front if you heard about it. We divorced her from you to protect you, comrade." I was very angry at the time and said some harsh words. Secretary Shi then turned against me. He said, "Your marriage didn't go through my hands. You deceived the woman into marrying you." I had no choice but to return to Qingfeng to get the marriage certificate. In the interval while I was away, Secretary Shi used the name of the Jinnan Military Region to call my military region, saying that I had deserted with a gun and was womanizing in Xingtai City, hoping to have me detained and transferred to the Jinnan Military Region. At the same time, he wrote a letter to my military region, saying the same thing. Later, I went to the Xingtai Municipal Government to resolve the issue, and they sent me to the Jinnan Military Region for confinement. I explained the situation repeatedly, and after the military region investigated and clarified the situation, they released me. It has been half a year now, and my problem has not been resolved. I wanted to go to the North China Government, but they won't let me. I have no choice but to ask you to forward this to the Xingtai Municipal Government for a prompt resolution.

　　区秘书为啥批准我的老婆离婚？
    冀南军区纺织工厂  张振华编辑同志：
    我有件婚姻问题，没法解决。我是冀鲁豫清丰县人，因祖父在邢台市南关落户，一九四七年秋天与南关刘新德之女刘金贵结婚。结婚前在四区区公所办的订婚手续。结婚后三个月后，我准备和补充团南下，便将女人留在邢市他娘家。因工作忙，我五个月没回家，也没写信。今年二月她本街柴良生张玉振和妇女主席郭二妮等，造谣说我在河南牺牲啦，并对我妻说：“有很多人要斗争你哩，我有个办法不如早给你找个对象，有一个荣退军人，和区里史秘书很不错，谁也不敢斗他，你看怎样？”就这样又吓唬又劝说的十几天内就由史秘书批准离婚，遂着就和那个荣退军人结婚了。
    我从部队上回来了，他们也不让女人和我见面，区里史秘书动员我说：“女人是个破鞋，怕你在前方听说了不安心。我们为了爱护你这个同志，才让她与你离了婚。”我当时很生气，便说了几句难听的话，史秘书就和我翻了脸。他说：“你们结婚没经我的手，你是欺骗女人结的婚。”我只得回清丰去拿结婚证明书，就在我回家的这个空隙，史秘书便用冀南军区的名义，给我军区打电话，说我是拐枪逃跑，并在邢市搞女人，希扣留转送冀南军区，同时又给我军区写了信，也是这样说的。后来我到了邢台市政府来解决，又把我送到冀南军区禁闭。我再三说明，又经军区调查清楚，才将我放出。现在已经半年了，而我的问题还没有个结果，我想去找华北政府，也不叫我去，我没法了，只得请你们代转邢台市政府迅速给我解决。
