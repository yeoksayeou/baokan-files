　　[Northern Yue News] The Northern Yue Third Commissioner's Office convened a winter production conference, inspecting various mass cooperatives in western Pingxi and formulating specific measures for rectification and development. Currently, the main types of cooperatives in Pingxi are as follows: First, supply and marketing cooperatives. These are combined with the development of mass production. Their main business is to export local coal and mountain products in exchange for necessities, drive mass transportation and sales, promote mass handicraft production, and solve the difficulties of the masses. Second, consumer cooperatives. These are mostly composed of small villages far from towns. Their business is to purchase necessities for farmers and sell them to members at low prices, reducing intermediate exploitation and saving the masses the labor of going to market. Third, production cooperatives. These cooperatives are small and simple, organized collectively by a few people, adopting the method of assigning work and mutual assistance to carry out agricultural and sideline production.

    What problems currently exist in the Pingxi cooperatives? First, in terms of business operations: Generally, cooperatives lose money when calculated in kind but make money when calculated in currency. Therefore, problems arise when settling accounts and distributing dividends. For example, some cooperatives calculate profits in currency, and staff members still receive dividends, resulting in the distribution of members' shares. In addition, some cooperatives restrict the masses from selling goods externally, stipulating that they must sell to the cooperative at a low price. Some use most of the funds loaned to the cooperative by the public for speculative transactions instead of using them for production. Some cooperatives have too many accounts receivable, affecting business development. Second, in terms of service: According to statistics from ten cooperatives in Wanping, eight villages provide services for staff members, causing public dissatisfaction. Some cooperatives also practice "thick accounting" (结帐不彻底结清，留下尾巴归入下月), and some cooperatives have no regulations for public welfare funds and reserve funds, and when they do, their use is inappropriate.

    Based on the types of cooperatives and the existing problems, the conference put forward opinions on future rectification and development. Small labor exchange groups, joint collective management of small handicraft industries, and various household sideline industries should all be greatly developed, strengthened in leadership, and given strong support. General supply and marketing cooperatives that are not closely integrated with mass production, consumer cooperatives that do not target members but simply pursue profits and sell prohibited goods should all be rectified. Cooperatives formed from the fruits of victory should formally allocate shares to individuals, and with their consent, continue to invest in operations. Certain undesirable behaviors of cooperatives that restrict the masses' freedom of trade should be corrected, so that cooperatives truly organize mass production and solve various difficulties in production.

　　北岳三专署整顿平四合作社
  　加强扶植小手工业
    【北岳讯】北岳三专署召开冬季生产会议，对平西各种群众性的合作社作了检查，并订出整顿与发展的具体办法。目前平西合作社，主要有以下几种类型：第一是供销合作社。与发展群众生产相结合，主要业务是把当地出产的煤、山货输出，换回必需品，带动群众运输运销，促进群众性的手工业生产，解决群众的困难。第二是消费合作社。大都是距市镇较远的小村集股组成的，其业务是购买农民必需品，低价卖给社员，减轻了中间剥削，节省了群众赶集的劳动力。第三是生产合作社。此种合作社是小型简单的几个人集体组织起来，采取拨工互助的办法进行农副业生产。
    目前平西合作社存在着什么问题呢？第一是业务经营方面：一般合作社是按实物计算就赔钱，按货币计算就赚钱。因此在结帐分红时就会发生问题。如有的合作社按货币算赚了钱，职员还同样分红，结果是分了社员的股本。另外有的合作社限制群众向外卖东西，规定必须卖给合作社，而且价钱低。有的把公家贷给合作社的款，大部都做了投机买卖，并没用于生产。有的合作社赊帐太多，影响业务发展。第二是勤务方面：据宛平十个合作社统计，有八个村替职员包勤务，群众不满。还有的合作社打厚成（结帐不彻底结清，留下尾巴归入下月），有的合作社没有公益金与公积金的规定，有规定的，使用也不恰当。
    会议根据上述合作社的种类和存在的问题，提出今后整顿与发展的意见。对小型拨工组、合资集体经营的小手工业、各种家庭副业等，都应大大加以发展，加强领导，予以有力扶助。对一般供销社与群众生产结合不够紧密、消费合作社不以社员为对象、单纯追逐利润、贩卖违禁品的，都应加以整顿。对以胜利果实组成的合作社，应该正式分配作成个人股金，在本人同意下，继续入股经营。某些合作社限制群众买卖自由的不良行为应当纠正，使合作社真正作到组织群众生产，解决生产中的各种困难。（荒山）
