Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS reports: The latest issue of New Times magazine published an article by Harahayan entitled "The Land Reform in the Soviet Zone of Germany." The article stated: For more than three years, the Soviet Zone of Germany, relying on the principles of the Potsdam and Yalta Agreements, has implemented systematic democratic reforms, one of the first measures of which was the land reform implemented in 1945. By July 1, 1947, when the land reform was largely completed, a total of 3,041,000 hectares of land had been confiscated and distributed to landless, land-poor, or non-agricultural families and immigrant families. All Junker family estates of more than 100 hectares, estates belonging to war criminals and Nazi leaders (regardless of size), and almost all estates of the Hitler state, the Nazi Party, and other criminal groups were confiscated without compensation.

The author pointed out that as a result of the implementation of the above-mentioned land reform, which covered one-third of Germany's territory, more than 110,000 landless farmers and farm laborers each received an average of 6.8 hectares of land; 83,802 immigrants each received an average of 8.4 hectares; 113,324 small farmers each received an average supplement of 2.7 hectares; 130,881 non-agricultural families and more than 49,000 small tenant farmers received land ranging from 0.7 hectares to 1.1 hectares. In addition to land, the working peasants also received other property confiscated from the landlords.

After pointing out that the land reform eliminated the remnants of feudal relations, the author added: The land reform in the Soviet Zone has produced a new type of producer cooperative, such as the Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee, which has 500,000 members. It has become a mass movement. The Mutual Aid Committee has a large amount of machinery and technical materials, which can provide practical assistance to farmers. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of farmers have been able to use machine plows, scientific sowing, and chemical fertilizers.

　　东德土地改革成就巨大
    无地少地农民皆分得土地封建剥削残余已彻底消除
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社讯：最近一期新时代杂志发表哈拉哈扬的论文，题为“德境苏占区的土地改革”。该文略称：三年多来，德境苏占区在依靠波茨顿和雅尔塔协定原则而实行的有系统的民主改革中，首先的措施之一便是一九四五年实行的土地改革。到一九四七年七月一日土改大体完成之时止，共没收了三、○四一、○○○公顷土地，分配给无地少地或非务农的家庭与移民家庭。凡是百公顷以上的容克家族地产、属于战犯和纳粹领袖的地产（不论大小），以及几乎全部希特勒国家、纳粹党和其他犯罪团体的地产，均无偿地加以没收。
    作者指出：由于实行了上述遍及德国三分之一领土的土地改革的结果，有十一万余家无地农民及雇农，平均每家得到土地六点八公顷；八三、八○二家移民每家平均得到八点四公顷；一一三、三二四家小农每家平均补充了二点七公顷；一三○、八八一家非务农家庭和四万九千余家小佃农得到了自零点七公顷至一点一公顷不等的土地。除了土地以外，劳动农民还分得了从地主那里没收来的其他财产。
    在指出土地改革消除了封建关系的残余后，作者复称：苏占区的土地改革产生了一种新型的生产者合作社，如农民互助委员会，即有会员五十万人。并已成为一种群众运动。互助委员会具有大量的机械和技术资材，能够给农民以切实的帮助，因此数十万农民已能用到机器犁，科学播种和化学肥料。
