Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 30th. The Central Plains and East China Field Armies are closely united and fighting shoulder to shoulder, demonstrating lofty class love. On the 11th of this month, one battalion of a certain unit of the East China Field Army arrived at Jicun after a night march. Because of the rain, their clothes were all wet. However, the village was very small and already full of a certain regiment of the Central Plains Field Army. The machine gun company of the battalion camped next to a haystack. When the comrades of the Central Plains Field Army saw this, they immediately gave up their houses to the machine gun company, and also lent them their large marching pot. The machine gun company was tired from a night of marching and fell asleep without even taking off their packs. When the comrades of the Central Plains Field Army saw this, they uncovered their own quilts and covered the comrades of the first platoon of the East China Field Army's machine gun company. When the comrades of that platoon woke up and saw that they were covered with quilts, they were so grateful that they could not speak as they shook the hands of the comrades of the Central Plains Field Army. After the People's Liberation Army artillery destroyed the enemy's field fortifications southeast of Shuangduiji, the East China Field Army and the Central Plains Field Army charged shoulder to shoulder, completely annihilating the two regiments of enemy troops guarding the area. Before this campaign began, the leading organs of the two major field armies paid attention to strengthening the education of commanders and fighters on unity. For example, when the leader of a certain column of the East China Field Army conveyed the task, he personally and in detail introduced the various excellent work styles of the Central Plains Field Army, calling on all commanders and fighters to pay attention to strengthening unity and to humbly learn from the Central Plains Field Army. The political department of the column headquarters organized two participating regiments to go to the Central Plains Field Army units to learn from the practical experience and political work of encircling and annihilating Huang Wei's corps.

　　中原华东两大野战军
  　亲密团结并肩作战
    【新华社淮海前线三十日电】中原与华东两大野战军亲密团结，并肩作战，表现了崇高的阶级友爱。本月十一日，华东野战军某部一营经一夜行军到达集村，因天雨衣服尽湿，但该村很小，已为中原野战军某团住满，该营机枪连即在草垛旁露营。中原野战军同志看到后，即将自己住的房子让给机枪连居住，并将自己带来的大行军锅借给该连使用。机枪连因一夜行军疲劳，背包未解就睡下了。中原野战军同志看见，又把他们自己的被子解开给华野机枪连一排的同志盖上。该排同志醒来时，一看盖着被子，感激得握着中原野战军同志们的手说不出一句话来。解放军炮兵摧毁双堆集东南敌野战工事后，华东野战军和中原野战军并肩冲锋，将守敌两个团全部歼灭。在此战役未开始前，两大野战军领导机关即注重对指战员加强团结的教育。如华东野战军某纵队首长传达任务时，亲自详细介绍中原野战军的各种优良作风，号召全体指战员注意加强团结，虚心向中原野战军学习。纵队司令部政治部组织了两个参战团到中原野战军部队去学习围歼黄维兵团的实战经验与政治工作。
