Column: Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor:
    I have visited several factories and saw that the workers are working hard and are very busy. But I saw dust and fibrous materials flying all over the workshops, especially in the cotton wool and cigarette factories. This seriously irritates the workers' throats and tracheas, easily causing coughs and bronchitis, and prolonged exposure can lead to lung diseases, which is extremely harmful to the health of the workers. This issue should be given serious attention by the factory leaders. For the sake of the health of the employees and to benefit production, I suggest that they should be made to wear masks to prevent disease. Making a mask is very simple and doesn't cost much money; just get some gauze. If you don't know how to make one, you can ask at the hospital or pharmacy.

　　棉毛、卷烟等工厂工人要戴上口罩工作编辑同志：
    我参观了几个工厂，看到工友们都是努力生产，手脚不停十分忙碌。但我看到工房内的灰尘和纤维东西，满家飞扬，棉毛线和卷烟厂则更甚。这样就严重地刺激着工友们的喉头和气管，容易引起咳嗽和气管支炎等病，长久下去会得肺病的，对工友们的健康有极大的损害。这个问题应引起厂方领导上的严重注意。为了职工的健康与对生产有利起见，我建议：应给他们制上个口罩戴上，便可防止造成疾病。做个口罩很简单，并不化多少钱，弄点纱布就行，如果不会做，可以去医院里或西药房里问一下。
