【Northern Yue News】 The people of various areas in the Northern Yue Region have already taken active measures, enthusiastically supporting the war to liberate all of North China, and are widely carrying out movements to transport victory grain and repair roads. Wangdu County alone mobilized 1,601 carts and 600 livestock, transporting 1,020,000 catties, exceeding the total task by one-third. The grain transport team of the tenth district of Yi County, despite the long distance and heavy loads, were highly motivated, transporting day and night, completing the 200,000-catty transport task in just two trips. The leader of the Sanggang Village team in the ninth district, in addition to leading the completion of all tasks assigned to his village, also used his own small donkey, which usually didn't meet the requirements for duty, to carry 50 catties. This influenced the villages of Yuangang, Koutou, and Liugang to exceed their original assigned tasks. Wu Village in the fifth district completed the first phase of the total task of 10,400 catties in one trip because of careful planning and responsible cadres. In addition to completing the originally assigned 150,000-catty task for the first phase, the eleventh district is now starting to load and transport the second phase. Fuxing Village in the eighth district had only 54 animals capable of carrying loads, and the first phase assigned task was 10,700 catties; due to the exemplary role of cadres and party members, the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly stimulated, and the task was completed in one trip, exceeding it by 636 catties. In the grain transportation, the village organized all manpower and livestock into four platoons, using thirteen animals to complete the task of sixty-two animals. Wang Xiuzhu, a Farmers' Association cadre, in addition to using livestock to carry 160 catties, also carried 40 catties himself. Their entire platoon used four animals to carry 700 catties. In Wan County, the fifth district mobilized 471 small carts from 31 villages in the district on December 18th to transport grain. On that day, the small cart team from Han Yonglu Village ate before dawn and arrived at the granary before sunrise. This time, the district transported a total of 52,661 and a half catties of grain, exceeding the plan by more than 2,600 catties, and saving 29 small carts.

　　In addition to grain transportation, people in various places have shown great enthusiasm for repairing roads and directly serving on the front lines. The people around Fangshan City, who had been ravaged by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits for a long time, actively repaired roads and bridges and reorganized logistics organizations before our army arrived. As soon as the battle began, the masses in various districts fully devoted themselves to the support-the-front movement. Near Shuangzhan in the sixth district, 20 villages mobilized 60 large carts and 30 stretchers in four hours. On December 18th, Huolu County received an order from its superiors to support the front. All seven labor companies in the county, with more than 1,200 people, arrived at the designated assembly point within 28 hours and left for the front line on the 19th. Before departure, a solemn mobilization meeting was held, proposing, "Never go home until the task is completed, gloriously go to the front line! Return victoriously with meritorious service!" When the task of repairing the Baoshi Railway was assigned to Mancheng, road repair workers from the county flocked to the site. The original plan was to repair the 18-li roadbed and highway from Fangshun Bridge to Tangcunpu, which required mobilizing 2,000 laborers and completing it in ten days; due to high morale, it was completed in eight days, and the repairs were of high quality and strong. In this road repair, many model deeds emerged: The original quota for Shuling Village in the first district was 30 laborers. Fearing that they would not be able to complete the task on time, they voluntarily sent 35 more people and quickly completed the task. Many of the laborers in Xiyantong Village worked shirtless. Many laborers broke their hands while picking up stones. Some even got blisters on their hands from tamping. Hanzhuang Village arrived two days late, so they launched a surprise attack under the moonlight at night, and quickly completed the task. When Dongxishui and other three villages in Yi County received the task of repairing the motor road, the young and middle-aged people had all gone to transport grain. At this time, Lu Zhenying, the director of the Women's Federation of Dongxishui, mobilized 16 young women, along with a total of 45 people from Shijiatong and Songshan villages, bringing their own millet, iron shovels, and picks, and worked with the elderly and children to repair more than ten li of motor road in four days.

    【北岳讯】北岳区各地人民已经积极行动起来，热烈支援解放全华北的战争，普遍开展运送胜利粮和修路运动。望都全县共动员了大车一千六百零一辆、牲口六百头，运了一百零二万斤，超过总任务三分之一。易县十区的运粮大队，路又远装的又多，但情绪都很饱满，昼夜不停地运送，二十万斤的运粮任务，两次就全部完成了。九区桑岗村中队长除了领导把分配给本村的任务全部完成，还用自己家平时不到够出勤务条件的小驴驮运五十斤。因此影响得苑岗、口头、刘岗三村也超过了原分配的任务。五区武庄村因为事先作好了周密的计划，干部又负责任，一趟就完成了第一期的总任务一万四百斤。十一区除了完成原分配第一期的十五万斤任务外，现在又开始装运第二期的了。八区复兴村能驮的牲口只有五十四头，第一期分配的任务是一万七百斤；由于干部、党员的模范作用，大大激励了群众的热情，结果一趟就完成了任务，而且超过六百三十六斤。该村在运粮中，把全村人畜力组织成四个排，他们用十三个牲口完成了六十二个牲口的任务。农会干部王秀竹除了用牲口驮一百六十斤外，自己还背了四十斤，他们全排用四个牲口就驮了七百斤。完县五区在十二月十八日发动了全区三十一个村的四百七十一辆小车进行运粮，当天，韩永禄村的小车队，起五更就吃了饭，太阳还没有出来就到了粮库。该区这次共运粮五万二千六百六十一斤半，超过计划两千六百多斤，并节省了二十九辆小车。
    除了运粮之外，各地人民对修路和直接到前线去服务，都表现了高度的热情。过去长期被日寇、蒋匪摧残蹂躏的房山城周围人民，在我军未到之前，就积极修路修桥，整顿后勤组织。战斗一开始，各区群众即全力投入支前运动。六区双站附近共二十个村，四个钟头动员了六十辆大车、三十付担架。十二月十八日，获鹿县接到上级支前命令，全县七个民工连一千二百多人，在二十八小时内就全部到达了指定集合地点，十九日就开赴前线去了。出发前，曾举行了庄严的出征动员大会，提出“完不成任务决不回家，光荣地走上前线！胜利地立功归来！”修复保石铁路的任务布置到满城时，该县的修路民工都蜂拥赶来，原计划修复从方顺桥到汤村铺十八里路基和公路，需发动两千民工，十天完成；由于群情高涨、八天就完成了，而且修的又好又坚固。在这次修路中，涌现很多模范事迹：一区守陵村原定三十个民工，他们恐怕到期完不成，又自动去了三十五人，很快的把任务完成了。西阎童村的民工，许多都是脱了光膀子干活。有不少民工检石头把手都刺破了。也有的打夯把手磨了血泡。韩庄村去的晚了两天，就在夜晚月光下展开了突击，结果也很快的完成了任务。易县东西水等三村接到修汽车路的任务时，正值青壮年都参加运粮去了；这时东西水妇联主任卢振英就发动了十六名青年妇女，连同石家统、松山两村的共四十五人，自带小米、铁锨和镐，协同老人和儿童，在四天中修好了十余里的汽车路。
