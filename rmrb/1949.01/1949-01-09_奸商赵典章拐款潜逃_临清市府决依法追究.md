[Jinan Electric] Linqing City profiteer Zhao Dianzhang has embezzled funds and fled, and the city government is pursuing legal action. This Zhao Dianzhang is from the Second District of Linqing City and opened the Liheng Flower Shop on Shangwan Street, serving as its manager. On November 19th, he proactively requested the state-owned Huamao Goods Depot to purchase cotton velvet on his behalf. Huamao, unaware of his ulterior motives, immediately agreed, stipulating that payment would be made on the same day, and the cotton delivered on the same day. However, using sweet talk, he overspent the allocated funds by 4,032,140 yuan. Huamao, realizing the extent of the overspending, decided to stop further withdrawals and urged him to deliver the cotton quickly. Unexpectedly, having achieved his premeditated scheme, he fled with the funds on the 26th. After Huamao reported this to the city government, the city government, after investigation, deemed that such illegal fund-embezzling profiteers should be severely investigated according to the law. On the 2nd of this month, the Judicial Section of the city government sealed all of his residential property located at No. 34, Heijia Hutong, Qian Guan Street. How to compensate Huamao for this loss is currently under consideration. The city government is also using this case to educate all merchants in the city, calling on them to wage a resolute struggle against illegal embezzlement, speculation, and profiteering.

　　奸商赵典章拐款潜逃
  　临清市府决依法追究
    【冀南电】临清市奸商赵典章骗款潜逃，市政府正依法追究。该赵典章为临清市二区人，在上湾街开设利恒花店，自任经理。十一月十九日，主动向公营商店华茂货栈要求代购棉绒，华茂不知道他有不良企图，当即答允，议定当日取款，当日送棉。但他以花言巧语，长支款数达四百零三万二千一百四十元。华茂因长支款数太大，议定除停止继续取款外，催他赶快交棉。不料他因预谋已达，竟于二十六日携款潜逃。华茂向市政府告发后，经市府研究，认为此种非法骗款之奸商，应依法严加追查。本月二日，市府司法科已将其座落前关街黑家胡同门牌三十四号宅房全部查封。如何偿还华茂是项损失，正在拟办中。市府并以此向全市商人进行教育，号召今后应与非法拐骗、投机取巧之奸商进行坚决斗争。
