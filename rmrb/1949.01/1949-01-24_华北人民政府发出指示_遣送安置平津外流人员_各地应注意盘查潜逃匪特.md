　　North China People's Government Issues Instructions
  　Sending Back and Resettling People Streaming Out of Beiping and Tianjin
    All Localities Should Pay Attention to Investigating and Arresting Fleeing Bandits and Special Agents
    [Report from this Newspaper] In view of the large number of people expected to flow out of Beiping and Tianjin, and the need for localities to prepare in advance, the North China People's Government issued instructions on the 12th to governments at and above the county level, stating: With the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin imminent (Tianjin has already been liberated by our army), a large number of people may flow into the liberated areas. Among them, in addition to prisoners and surrendered soldiers, scattered soldiers and vagrants, there will be many fleeing landlords, stubborn puppet elements, enemy religious personnel, refugees driven in by the enemy, or other people voluntarily returning to their hometowns. Enemy agents will certainly take this opportunity to infiltrate our areas in a planned way to lie dormant and carry out sabotage. In order to maintain the治安 in our area and properly arrange for the employment of these people, the following instructions are issued:

    I. All those whose homes are not in this liberated area shall be promptly sent out of the territory along the following four main lines: one via the Jinpu Railway, one via the Beining Railway, one via the PingSui Railway, and one via the PingHan Railway. Except for those using trains, who should be transported free of charge, all others should provide their own travel expenses and food. In principle, no relief will be provided. The demobilization expenses for prisoners or surrendered soldiers will be issued directly by the army, and the county governments do not need to provide additional subsidies.

    II. All those whose homes are in the liberated area should be sent home quickly along the way to engage in production. However, after arriving in their villages, they should register with the district government. They should also provide their own travel expenses and food. In principle, no relief will be provided. Except for those whose homes were originally in the city, or who have employment in the city, they shall not reside in the city (those who reside in the city shall register with the Public Security Bureau).

    III. Along the main lines and in the local governments along the way, in addition to organizing警戒and inspections, maintaining order, and preventing sabotage, attention should also be paid to searching for enemy officers and special agents who are disguised and attempting to escape. At the same time, propaganda should be carried out to explain our policies and mobilize people to return home to engage in production.

    IV. Those with labor power can be introduced or organized to participate in labor to maintain their livelihoods. Intellectuals or religious personnel who are willing to stay in our area to work can be centrally trained by the Administrative Office or directly affiliated municipal governments, and then assigned work, or sent to various special training classes to study.

    V. Separate instructions and arrangements will be made for the handling and prevention of special agents.

    VI. For elderly, weak, disabled, and sick people who return to their original homes in the North China Liberated Area, efforts should be made to mobilize them to rely on relatives and engage in production. Those who have no support at all may, upon request from the district and village and approval from the county government, be granted relief as appropriate, for a maximum of two months. The monthly subsidy should not exceed 30 catties of millet. The conditions for issuing should be very strict, but if there is any way to be self-reliant, relief should not be provided. This relief grain will be paid from local grain funds.

    VII. Landlords who have fled and returned to the village should be given land according to the Land Law Outline to enable them to produce. In villages where land has already been distributed, the county government should make proper arrangements for their livelihoods so that they can support themselves.

    VIII. After receiving these instructions, study the implementation methods and report the planning situation to the government at any time.

　　华北人民政府发出指示
  　遣送安置平津外流人员
    各地应注意盘查潜逃匪特
    【本报讯】为平津将有大批人口外流，各地应预为布置，华北人民政府特于十二日发出指示，指示县以上各级政府称：平津解放在即（天津已为我军解放），可能有大量人口流入解放区。其中除俘虏及投降士兵、散兵游勇外，多为逃亡地主、顽伪分子，敌公教人员，被敌驱入之难民，或其他自愿回籍人员，而敌方特务趁此有计划地打入我区潜伏破坏者亦必大有人在，兹为维持本区治安及妥为安置此批人员就业计，特作指示如下：
    一、凡家非本解放区者，一律依下列四条基干线迅速遣送出境。“经津浦路，一经北宁路，一经平绥路，一经平汉路，除通火车者应免费遣送外，一律自备旅费吃食，原则上不予救济。俘虏或投降士兵之遣散费由军队直接发给，各县府不必再予补助。
    二、凡家在解放区者，沿途迅速遣送回家，从事生产。但到本村后，应向区政府登记，亦一律自备旅费吃食，原则上不予救济。除原来家在城市，或在城谋有职业者外，不得留居城市（留居城市者应至公安局登记）。
    三、沿基干线及沿途地方政府，除应组织警戒盘查，维护秩序，防止破坏，并注意搜索化装潜逃之敌方军官与特务分子外，同时应作宣传，说明我们政策，动员归家生产。
    四、凡有劳力者，可介绍或组织其参加劳动，自维生活。知识分子或公教人员愿留我区工作者，可由行署或直属市府集中训练，分配工作，或商送各种特设之训练班学习。
    五、对于特务分子之处理及防范，另行指示布置。
    六、凡回华北解放区原籍后之孤老残病人员，应尽量动员其投靠亲戚，从事生产，其全无依靠者，经区村请求县府核准，得酌予救济，最长二个月，每月补助小米最多不得超过三十斤，发给条件应十分严格，但有一线办法，能自力更生者即不应救济，此项救济粮由地方粮内开支。
    七、逃亡地主回村后，应按土地法大纲设法分给土地，令其生产。在土地业已分配完毕之村庄，应由县府妥为筹措生活方法使得自食其力。
    八、接此指示后即研究执行方法并希将筹划情形随时报府。
