Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 7th. The following experiences have been gained by the public commercial firms in Luoyang in organizing the production of poor citizens:

　　I. Organize citizens' production through various businesses, based on the principle of voluntary participation. When the Xiefeng Commercial Firm initially mobilized women to make cloth shoes, no one came to the door for two or three days because the citizens did not understand the public commercial firm. The manager and staff of the commercial firm went to the neighborhood to publicize or individually mobilize them, explaining the business purpose of the public commercial firm. Then three or four women began to go to the commercial firm to receive shoes for trial production. After they received the wages they deserved, the number of women who went to Xiefeng to make shoes gradually increased. Conversely, a public commercial firm in the first street of the sixth district made the mistake of being too hasty in organizing citizens' production. The first day, they arranged production at a cadre meeting, and the next day, they convened a general meeting of all residents in the street to mobilize production. The residents were confused by the rumors of the Kuomintang secret agents in the past, fearing that they would be编 into "transport teams" or "female soldiers." Therefore, the women said they could not spin thread, and the men said they could not run transportation, and they all refused. Later, using individual mobilization methods, citizens successively signed up to participate in production.

　　II. Resolutely overcome the simple profit-seeking viewpoint and the "relief" concept in loans. In the early days of the Qingfeng Commercial Firm's establishment, out of a total capital of 100,000 Central Plains Currency, they were anxious to make profits but bought twenty to thirty thousand yuan worth of red and white sugar that were not needed for citizens' production. The wages paid for organizing citizens to spin wool were also lower than those of private merchants, which resulted in separation from the masses. After review, the business policy was changed, and the wages were appropriately increased. Poor citizen Jia Shitai bought 20 pounds of wool thread, knitted sweaters, and sold them, earning a net profit of 1,500 Central Plains Currency. After deducting the cost, he could still continue to produce. Therefore, the poor people reflected: "As long as you are willing to work, you can live." In this way, the vast majority of citizens united around the public commercial firms to carry out production. The Xiefeng Commercial Firm, due to unclear circumstances, once lent money to two vagrant women, but later discovered that the loan principal had been exchanged for drugs. Xiefeng did not pursue the matter because of their poverty, which not only caused losses to the government but also aroused dissatisfaction among the citizens. After accepting this lesson, Xiefeng resolutely implemented the principle that loans must be issued carefully and repaid.

　　III. In the process of organizing citizens' production, promptly change unreasonable business methods and pay attention to reducing costs and increasing production at any time. When citizens began to participate in making shoes, it was through street chiefs introducing or receiving on their behalf. Some street chiefs introduced their relatives to receive shoes to make, and a few poor people could not receive them. After discovering this unreasonable situation, the Xiefeng Commercial Firm set up production committees or sales stations in each street to directly distribute shoe materials to citizens. The Qingfeng Shoe Factory organized small shoe workshops, receiving raw materials and wages from the commercial firm, and contracting for unified production, avoiding the malpractice of a few bad street cadres. In order to improve the quality of finished products, the Qingfeng Factory divided wages into three grades according to the density of the stitching on the soles. The Xiefeng Factory stipulated that a bonus of two yuan would be given for each pair of shoes with excellent quality. These methods have achieved a certain degree of effectiveness in improving the quality of finished products and the enthusiasm for production.

　　组织市民生产经验
    【新华社洛阳七日电】洛阳市各公营商行在组织贫苦市民生产中获得了如下几项经验：
    一、通过各种业务，在市民自愿原则下组织他们生产。协丰商行在初发动妇女承制布鞋时，因市民对公营商行不了解，两三天没有人上门。该商行经理店员便分头去街坊宣传或作个别动员，解释公营商行的营业宗旨。于是三四个妇女开始到商行领鞋试做。在她们领回应得工资后，到协丰领鞋做的妇女便逐渐增加。相反地，有一公营商行在六区一街组织市民生产时犯了急性病，第一天在干部会布置生产，第二天即召开全街居民大会动员生产，居民们被过去国民党特务的谣言所迷惑，怕把他们编成“运输队”或“女兵”，因此女的说不会纺线，男的说不会跑运输，都拒绝了。后来采用个别动员的方法，市民便陆续报名参加生产了。
    二、坚决地克服单纯的营利观点和贷款中的“救济”观念。庆丰商行成立初期，总共十万元中州币的资本，因急于求利却买了两三万元不为市民生产所需要的红白糖。在组织市民纺毛线时所付工资又低于私商，结果就脱离了群众。后经检讨，才改变了营业方针，并将工资适当提高。贫民贾世太前后买毛线二十磅，织成毛衣卖出，净赚中州币一千五百元，除去本钱外，自己仍能再生产。因之贫民反映：“只要肯劳动，就能过日子了。”这样广大市民便纷纷团结在公营商行周围进行生产。协丰商行开始因不明情况曾贷款给两个游民妇女，后来发觉贷本被她们换吸了毒品。协丰念其家穷未予追究，结果不但政府受到损失，而且引起市民不满。协丰接受这一教训后，才坚决执行了贷款必须慎重发放及有借有还的原则。
    三、在组织市民生产过程中，及时改变不合理的营业方式，并随时注意减低成本提高生产。市民开始参加做鞋时，是通过街长介绍或代领，有的街长介绍自己的亲戚来领鞋做，少数贫民反领不到。发现这种不合理情形后，协丰商行就在各街设生产委员或推销站，直接将鞋料分发给市民。庆丰鞋厂则组织小型鞋坊，向商行领取原料、工资，统一包做，避免了少数不好的街干部从中舞弊。为提高成品质量，庆丰厂按鞋底纳的细密程度将工资分为三等。协丰厂规定质量优良的鞋子每对给奖励金二元。这些办法对提高成品质量与生产积极性都收到一定程度的效果。
