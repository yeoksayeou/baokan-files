　　Grain and Travel Expense Supply System
　　All Agencies' Outgoing Personnel Should Strictly Implement

    In order to reduce the burden on the common people and facilitate the work of village cadres, the Beiyue Administrative Office has issued standards for the supply of grain and travel expenses to all agencies, troops, factories, and schools. However, it has recently been discovered that there are many violations of the system.

    Lingshou Ciyu is a central town for travel and business, with many passing military personnel and staff. Almost every day, people are lodging there. Once, personnel from the Beiyue Factory and other units stayed overnight in the town and forced village cadres to rent quilts and provide meals for them. The town rents out an average of fifteen quilts per night, at a rental price of 3,000 yuan per quilt, requiring 45,000 yuan for quilt rentals alone. This places an extra burden of 1,350,000 yuan per month on the village, which amounts to 4,050,000 yuan for the three winter months. Furthermore, the Beiyue Transportation Team forced village cadres to provide meals and chop straw in Huoying. Arguments and fights often break out between village cadres over providing meals, making it impossible for village cadres to cope, and causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

    It is suggested that leaders at all levels strictly enforce the supply system, require outgoing personnel to carry bedding, grain, and travel expenses, and strictly implement lower-level inspection systems with more education.

　　粮食旅费供给制度
  　各机关外出人员应严格执行
    北岳行署为减轻老百姓负担，便利村干工作，特发出各机关、部队、工厂、学校供给粮食旅费标准，但最近发现不少违犯制度的现象。
    灵寿慈峪是个来往中心市镇，过往的军队工作人员很多，差不多每天有人住宿。一次北岳工厂等人员，夜宿该镇，强迫村干给他们赁被子、派饭。该镇平均每宿赁被子十五条，每条赁价三千元，一宿仅赁被洋即需四万五千元，每月村中额外负担一百三十五万元，按冬三月计算合洋四百零五万元。北岳运输队又在霍营强迫村干部派饭铡草。往往因派饭和村干部争吵、打架，村干部无法支应，群众不满。
    建议各级首长，严格供给制度，出外人员必须携带被服，粮食旅费，并严格下层检查制度，多进行教育。
