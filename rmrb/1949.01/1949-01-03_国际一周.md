International Week

    American imperialism is openly supporting Holland's aggressive war to enslave the Indonesian people. The Economic Cooperation Administration, the executive agency for U.S. "foreign aid," announced on the 22nd that it had approved $545,000 in aid to the Netherlands. The Dutch Foreign Minister revealed in a recent statement that Holland "can purchase essential materials needed for military aggression against Indonesia under the Marshall Plan without any difficulty." Meanwhile, at the three-day meeting of the UN Security Council on the Indonesian question, which began on the 22nd, representatives from the United States, Britain and other countries openly adopted a position of protecting and condoning Dutch aggression. At the first day's meeting, the US representative put forward a so-called proposal for a ceasefire and troop withdrawal by both sides to help Holland escape its crime of aggression. In the Security Council, only the Soviet representative sternly condemned Dutch aggression, refuted the US representative's accomplice proposal, and put forward a just proposal requiring the Netherlands to withdraw its troops to the boundaries before the aggression occurred, as the first step to resolve the dispute. However, under the manipulation of the United States and Britain, the Security Council passed a resolution requiring a ceasefire by "both sides." With this spiritual and material support from the United States, the Dutch aggressor troops, disregarding the Security Council's ceasefire order, continued to intensify their attacks and seizures of territory, occupying major cities such as Madiun and the Indonesian government's capital in Sumatra, Bukittinggi, and many other cities and towns, large and small, in an attempt to create a fait accompli. At the same time, Dutch imperialism is conducting so-called negotiations with the captured Indonesian traitor government leaders Hatta, Sukarno, etc., wanting to lead them by the nose to organize a purely colonial puppet government. And the United States is again playing a matchmaking role, "behind the scenes persuading the Netherlands to release the captured leaders of the Republic" (Associated Press).
    This collusive aggression by the U.S. and Dutch imperialists continues to be resisted by the Indonesian people and opposed and condemned by progressive people and just public opinion around the world. Many Indonesian communists and patriots who escaped from the chaos in Yogyakarta have returned to the guerrillas to participate in the resistance movement. The resistance faction in the Indonesian government army is fiercely resisting the invading army in central Java. The "area around Yogyakarta, which has been invaded, is still the scene of fierce fighting" (United Press). Many sailors in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, have sailed their ships out of the port after the dock and shipyard workers went on strike to protest against the Dutch government. Australian port workers have announced a boycott of all exports to Indonesia. The Australian Seamen's Union announced that its members would not operate Dutch ships docked in Australian ports. On the 24th, Indian students held an anti-Dutch protest demonstration in front of the Dutch Embassy in Delhi.
    News of the continued deterioration of the U.S. economy has recently been frequently reported from various sources. The number of unemployed people in the United States is increasing dramatically. Even according to recent official U.S. statistics, in early November, the total number of unemployed people in the United States had increased by 189,000 compared with October, and the number of partially unemployed people was 12,622,200, a sharp increase of 3,926,600 compared with November last year. The increase in the number of unemployed people since the beginning of November has been particularly alarming. In the two weeks ending December 10 alone, 48,000 workers in New York City were thrown into the ranks of the unemployed. The dramatic increase in the number of unemployed people in the United States is a clear sign of the significant deterioration of the U.S. economy and is a direct result of relative overproduction and production cuts in the United States. Despite the artificial stimulus measures adopted by the U.S. reactionary authorities to expand the military and provide "aid" to foreign countries, large quantities of U.S. products still cannot be sold, and inventories are piling up. According to a TASS dispatch on the 20th, citing a bulletin issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Statistics, the total value of various goods currently piled up in warehouses is as high as 54.4 billion U.S. dollars, which is almost double the 29.8 billion yuan in June of this year. This evil consequence of relative overproduction has triggered a wave of production cuts, business closures, and layoffs. According to TASS reports, production cuts and layoffs in the textile, wool, hosiery, electrical appliance, and rubber industries in various parts of the United States have become widespread. In the past two months, the textile and hosiery industries have laid off 100,000 workers, and some electrical appliance companies have laid off more than half of their workers. Thousands of mines are either reducing coal production or closing down completely. This increasingly downhill and deteriorating situation in the U.S. economy is causing "entrepreneurs across the United States to be distressed and agitated." (Associated Press)
    In order to salvage this serious economic situation, the U.S. reactionaries are stepping up their efforts to promote military expansion and the "Marshall Plan." Truman is formulating an unprecedentedly large budget for the coming year. According to Truman's Economic Advisory Council on the 27th, the size of military spending in this budget is "unforeseen since the Second World War." At the same time, U.S. Secretary of the Army Royall and other military and government leaders have recently traveled to Europe one after another, on the one hand trying to bring Italy and other countries into the "North Atlantic Alliance" currently being negotiated in Washington; on the other hand, they are also instigating reactionary countries in the Mediterranean region to form a "Mediterranean Pact." These activities of the U.S. reactionaries have two purposes: one is to continue preparing for war; the other is to attempt to use this as one of the magic weapons to escape its economic crisis. The U.S. big capitalists are prepared to spend 2 billion U.S. dollars annually on this "North Atlantic Alliance." According to the Soviet Labor News, their purpose is to hope that this will maintain a "war boom" in industry.
    Other important international events in the past week are as follows:
    (1) On the 24th, MacArthur, the head of the U.S. reactionaries, arbitrarily released 19 important Japanese war criminals who had not yet been sentenced; and announced that the trial of the main Japanese war criminals "has ended." Among the released war criminals were many culprits who massacred the Chinese people, including Hata Shunroku, the former commander of the Japanese army in China.
    (2) The Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Workers' Party closed on the 25th. The congress decided to rename the Workers' Party the "Bulgarian Communist Party." The congress elected a new Central Committee, and Dimitrov was re-elected as General Secretary. The congress also elected a special committee to be responsible for drafting a new party program. The First Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party has closed after electing leading bodies.
    (3) The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth held a meeting in Paris from the 18th to the 24th. The meeting decided to issue a call to the world's democratic youth, demanding that they strengthen the struggle for peace, democracy, and a better future for youth. The meeting also decided to convene the World Youth Congress in Budapest, Hungary in early September 1949.

### 国际一周

专栏：国际一周

　　国际一周
    美国帝国主义正公开支援荷兰进行奴役印尼人民的侵略战争。美国“援外”执行机关经济合作总署，已于二十二日宣布批准对荷援助五十四万五千美元。荷兰外长在最近的声明中泄露：荷兰“按照马歇尔计划购买军事侵略印尼所需的重要物资，可以毫无困难地进行。”同时，联合国安理会在廿二日开始的讨论印尼问题的三天会议中，美英等国代表亦公然采取袒护和纵容荷兰侵略的立场。在第一天会上，美国代表提出了所谓双方停战与撤退军队的建议，以帮助荷逃避侵略罪行。在安理会上，只有苏联代表严词斥责了荷兰的侵略行为，反驳了美国代表的帮凶的提案，并提出了要求荷兰将其军队撤至其侵略行为发生前的界线，以作为解决纠纷的第一步骤等正义建议。但是，在美英操纵多数票的情况下，安理会却通过了要求“双方”停战的决议。就在美国这种精神和物质的支持下，荷兰侵略军竟不顾安理会的停战令，继续加紧攻城掠地，侵占茉莉芬和印尼政府在苏门答腊的首府布齐停基等大城市及其他许多大小城市，力图造成既成事实。荷兰帝国主义同时正与被俘的印尼卖国政府首脑哈达、苏加诺等进行所谓谈判，想牵着他们的鼻子出来组织纯粹殖民地的傀儡政府。而美国则又在作牵线活动，“幕后劝说荷兰释放被俘的共和国领袖”（美联社）。
    美荷帝国主义这种狼狈为奸的侵略罪行，继续遭受印尼人民的抵抗，和世界进步人民和正义舆论的反对和谴责。从日惹混乱情况中脱狱的许多印尼的共产党员和爱国分子，已回到游击队参加抵抗运动。印尼政府军中的抗战派，正在爪哇中部激烈抵抗侵略军。而被侵占的“日惹周围仍在激战”（合众社）。荷兰首府海牙的许多海员，继码头与造船工人罢工后，已将他们的船驶出港外，以表示对荷兰政府的抗议。澳洲港口工人宣布抵制运往印尼的全部输出物。澳洲海员工会宣布，该工会会员将不驾驶停在澳洲各港口的荷兰船只。印度学生二十四日在德里荷兰大使馆门前举行了反对荷兰的抗议示威。
    美国经济继续恶化的消息，最近又从各方面频频传来。美国的失业人数正不断剧增。即使根据美国官方最近的统计，在十一月初，美国全部失业的人数已较十月份增多十八万九千人，部分失业的人数为一千二百六十二万二千人，较去年十一月份猛增三百九十二万六千人。自十一月初到现在失业人数的增加特别惊人。仅在十二月十日为止的两周内，纽约市一地即有四万八千工人被抛入失业者的队伍。美国失业人数的剧烈增加，这是美国经济大大恶化的显明标志，是美国生产相对过剩和生产缩减的直接结果。尽管美国反动当局采用了扩军和对外“援助”的人为的刺激办法，但是美国大批的生产品仍旧推销不出去，存货堆积如山。据塔斯社二十日电引美商务部统计局所发表的公报，目前堆满在各个仓库内的各种商品的存货，总值高达五百四十四亿美元，与今年六月的二百九十八亿元比较，即几乎激增了一倍。这种生产相对过剩的恶果，引起了减少生产、倒闭企业、解雇工人的浪潮。据塔斯社报导：美国各地的纺织、羊毛、鞋袜、电气用具、橡皮等工业中的减产、解雇工人的情况，已普遍发生。最近两个月内，纺织和鞋袜工业已解雇十万工人，有些电汽用具公司已解雇工人一半以上。成千的矿场不是减少煤的产量，便是完全关闭矿场。美国经济这种日益走向下坡路的恶劣情况，使“美国全国各地的企业家正在苦恼和躁急”。（美联社）
    为了挽救这种严重的经济情况，美国反动派正加紧推行其扩军和“马歇尔计划”。杜鲁门正在制定一个空前庞大的下年度预算。据杜鲁门的经济顾问会议二十七日所透露：这一预算中军费之庞大，“为第二次世界大战以后所没有预料到的”。同时美国陆长罗耀尔等军事及政府首脑，最近以前曾纷纷赴欧活动，一方面竭力想把意大利等国拉入正在华盛顿谈判中的“北大西洋联盟”；另一方面又策动地中海一带的反动国家结成“地中海公约”。美国反动派的这些活动有两个目的，一个是继续作战争的准备；另一个是妄想以此作为逃避其经济危机的法宝之一。美国大资本家对这个“北大西洋联盟”，每年准备花费二十亿美元，其目的，据苏联劳动报称：希望借此能够维持工业中的“战争景气”。
    过去一周国际间其他重要事件如下：
    （一）美国反动派头子麦克阿瑟，于二十四日竟将尚未判刑的十九名日本重要战犯擅自释放；并宣布日本主要战犯之审判“业已结束”。被释放的战犯中，包括前日寇中国派遣军司令西尾寿造等许多屠杀中国人民的罪魁。
    （二）保加利亚工人党第五次代表大会，已于二十五日闭幕。大会决定将工人党改名为“保加利亚共产党”。大会选出了新的中央委员会，季米特洛夫连任为总书记。大会并选出专门委员会，负责制订新党纲草案。波兰统一工人党第一届大会，在选出领导机关后业已闭幕。
    （三）世界民主青年联盟执委会，于十八日至二十四日在巴黎开会，会议决定向世界民主青年发出号召，要求加强争取和平、民主和青年美好前途的斗争。会议并决议于一九四九年九月初在匈京布达佩斯召开世界青年大会。
