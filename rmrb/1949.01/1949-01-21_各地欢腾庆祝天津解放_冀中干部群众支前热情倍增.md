[Central Hebei Electric] The news of Tianjin's liberation spread like lightning through the cities and villages of central Hebei, filling the people with boundless joy. On the night of the 15th, Liu Shunyi of the Central Hebei Administrative Office's Support-the-Front Office, heard the news of Tianjin's liberation over the phone from the front lines. He was so excited he couldn't contain his racing heart, eager to share his joy with others. He immediately telegraphed the news to various locations. The next morning, comrades excitedly ran around spreading the news, presenting the victory of Tianjin's liberation as a greeting. The Xinji People's Education Center immediately wrote the victorious news of Tianjin's liberation on the blackboard bulletin. The Xinji Municipal Government held symposiums for workers and businesses on the 16th to celebrate the victory. The dozen or so worker representatives in attendance cheered and celebrated. Zhao Bingzhong, a toothbrush worker at the Central Hebei Workers' Cooperative, said, "What makes me especially happy today is that Tianjin's liberation will greatly benefit our industry. In the future, we can get large quantities of pig bristles from the Northeast, and there will be no problem with raw materials and sales." Jin Fujie, a worker at the Xinsheng Factory, said, "We can buy the machines we need most now." A female worker, Ma Xiaodian, said, "The workers in Tianjin have advanced technology, we should take the train and learn from them." Laughter filled the room. Ma Sipi of the Shengxiang Leather Factory said, beaming with joy, "Our goods are still stored in Tianjin! In the past, we couldn't transport them because of the enemy's heavy blockade. As soon as the military control period is over, we will go and get them immediately!" The Tongji Leather Shop said, "Our export goods will increase this time." Farmers near the rural areas of Tianjin said, "Iron ploughshares, wire beds, iron buckets, saws, axes… all have to come from Tianjin, this will be convenient." On the 15th, when the village cadres of Beiguan Village in Raoyang were discussing how to complete the support-the-front task, Zhao Cunyou ran in and said, "Tianjin has been taken, it's being broadcast on the radio!" Everyone was very happy and ran to the village government to inquire. Zhao Ting, Xiao Hei, and a dozen others celebrated the liberation of Tianjin by beating drums for a long time. Village cadres who had accepted the task of transporting grain from the district had just returned and hadn't even relayed the message yet when the masses already knew. Zhao Cunyou said, "Our village doesn't have enough carts, we'll carry them on our backs and push them to the front!" The people in the steamed bun shops also said, "If there aren't enough vehicles, it's easy to say, if the strong ones are gone, we'll use two for the weak, and if two aren't enough, we'll use three!" After receiving the notice, the repair shops immediately prepared to set off. The liberation of Tianjin stirred the hearts of everyone and inspired the masses' enthusiasm for supporting the front. Everyone said, "After taking Tianjin, we'll take Beiping, and then we'll go to the south to capture Chiang Kai-shek!"

　　各地欢腾庆祝天津解放
  　冀中干部群众支前热情倍增
    【冀中电】解放天津的消息，象闪电一样向冀中的城市和乡村传播，人民都表现无限的愉快。十五日夜半，冀中行署支前办公室刘顺义，从前方的电话中，听到了解放天津的消息，他兴奋的按不住心的跳动，只盼把自己的欢快很快的分给别人，于是他立即电告各地。翌日清晨，同志们狂欢的奔走相告，把解放天津的胜利消息当作了见面礼。辛集民教馆，把解放天津的胜利消息立即写在黑板报上，该市市政府于十六日分别召开了工、商座谈会，欢庆胜利，与会的十几位工人兄弟欢呼庆贺。冀中职工合作社牙刷工人赵秉众说：“今天我特别痛快的事，是天津解放后对我们这行工业有很大的好处，今后能从东北来大批猪鬃，原料，销路都不成问题。”新生工厂工人靳福聚说：“我们能买回最需要的机器来了。”女工马小典说：“天津工人们技术高，咱们要坐火车去向他们学习学习。”笑声响成一团。胜祥皮革厂马思皮喜形于色的说：“天津还存着我们的货哩，过去由于匪军的重重封锁无法运来，只要过了军管期我们便马上去取！”同积皮店说：“这一下咱们的出口货就增多了。”靠近天津农村的农民们说：“铁靶，铁丝床，铁桶锯，斧……都得从天津来，这可方便了。”十五日饶阳北官庄的村干部，正在商量怎样完成支前任务时，赵存有跑进来说：“天津拿下来了，电台上正在广播哩！”大家都很高兴，于是都跑到村政府去打听。赵廷、小黑十几个人在为庆祝天津解放，敲了半天鼓，从区接受了运粮任务的村干部，刚一回来，还没有传达，群众就都知道了。赵存有说：“咱村大车不够用，咱们背着，推着，也得送到前方去！”包子铺里的人们也说：“要车好说，壮的走了，弱的一个不行咱套两个，两个不行套三个！”修车户，接到通知后，马上就准备好了待命出发。天津的解放，激动了每一个人的心，鼓舞了群众支前情绪，大家都说：“拿下天津后，再拿下北平来，再就是到江南捉蒋介石去了！”
