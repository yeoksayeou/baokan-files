　　Soviet Collective Farm—Since the October Revolution, Soviet agriculture, under the slogan of "agricultural industrialization," has transformed from small-scale individual farming to collective, electrified, and mechanized production, leaping to become the world's largest socialist agricultural country.

　　Before the October Revolution, a minority of exploiting classes in Russia—landlords, royalty, clergy, and rich peasants—occupied 232.5 million hectares of land (each hectare equals 16 Chinese acres), while the working masses in rural areas only occupied 134.7 million hectares. Thirty percent of peasant households had no horses, 3-4% had no farm tools, and 15% had no seeds. Every year, more than two million hired laborers searched for work everywhere.

　　After the October Revolution, Stalin developed Lenin's instructions and completed the theory of comprehensive collectivization and the elimination of the rich peasant class on this basis, stipulating the collective farm as a socialist form of rural economy. After that, small agricultural production gradually moved towards collectivization. The year 1929 was a year of great transformation. With the participation of millions of poor and middle peasants, comprehensive collectivization was launched nationwide.

　　Before the start of the first Five-Year Plan (from 1928 to 1932), there were more than 20 million small-scale individual farming economies (accounting for 95.6% of the country's farmers). By 1939, these farmers had joined 241,000 collective farms, with more than 100 million acres of land (one acre equals six Chinese acres) for their permanent use. If forests, swamps, and pastures are included, each collective farm averaged more than 4,000 acres of land.

　　As a result of electrification and mechanization, in 1947, 3,100 power stations were already operating in rural areas. It was decided to restore and build 50 new power stations last year and this year and to establish 18,000 power stations belonging to collective farms on smaller rivers, with a total power generation capacity of one million kilowatts. In 1940, there were 523,000 tractors on farms, and efforts are currently being made to obtain another 112,000 tractors next year.

　　In collective farms, scientific division of labor and the substitution of electricity and machinery for manpower have saved farmers a great deal of labor, shortened working hours, and provided ample time for learning, entertainment, and recreation. In Crimea, a resort in southern Soviet Union, only emperors, nobles, and the general bourgeoisie could afford to visit in the past, but now it has become a sanatorium for the working people. Before the war, there were a total of 2,290 sanatoriums and resorts, providing millions of working people with medical treatment or vacation during their holidays. Although more than 1,600 of them were destroyed by the enemy during the war, most of them have now been restored, and the working people have resumed their happy life of medical treatment and rest.

　　Stakhanovite Movement—Stakhanov was originally a coal miner in the Soviet Union. In August 1935, during the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, Stakhanov mined 102 tons of coal in five hours and forty-five minutes. Ordinary coal miners can only mine 10 to 14 tons in the same time. That is to say, Stakhanov's production efficiency exceeded the production efficiency of ordinary workers by more than six times. However, Stakhanov was just an ordinary young worker, and his physical strength was not particularly different from others. The main reason why his production capacity could be so improved was that he was a highly conscious worker. He not only never wasted a minute of time at work, but also tried every means to improve work technology at any time and any place, so he created such amazing results. After Stakhanov's coal mining achievements spread, workers in various industrial sectors throughout the Soviet Union competed to learn from Stakhanov and automatically followed Stakhanov's example. This set off a mass movement of workers throughout the Soviet Union, which is called the Stakhanovite movement. This movement has continued to this day and has become a new direction for the working people of the entire Soviet Union and all new democratic countries, that is, the combination of physical labor and intellectual labor, making labor rational. In other words, improving productivity by relying solely on physical labor has certain limitations, and it is more important to study, master, and improve production technology. In 1935, Stalin said, "Stakhanovite workers are the innovators of Soviet industry," and also said, "This movement contains the seeds of the future cultural and technological upsurge of the working class." These words, as they appear today, have already been fully realized. From this, we can also know how important the Stakhanovite movement is.

　　Belarus—The Soviet Union was originally composed of sixteen republics; Belarus is one of the constituent republics. It is located on the western border of the European part of the Soviet Union, bordering Poland. It has a population of over ten million, and its capital, Minsk, is located in a vital area for Western European countries to reach the Soviet Union, with a very important position. During the Patriotic War, Belarus suffered the most brutal destruction by the fascist invaders. Now, with the gradual implementation of the first Five-Year Plan after the war, all industrial and agricultural production is moving towards the goal of exceeding pre-war levels. People's lives are quickly returning to pre-war levels and continuing to improve.

　　Soviet Council of Ministers—It is the highest state administrative organ in the Soviet Union. It is elected by the joint session of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities from among the representatives. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers is Stalin, and there are a total of ten Vice-Chairmen, whose names and concurrent positions are as follows: 1. Molotov, concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs; 2. Beria, concurrently Minister of Internal Affairs; 3. Andreyev, concurrently Minister of Agriculture; 4. Mikoyan, concurrently Minister of Foreign Trade; 5. Kosygin, concurrently Minister of Light Industry (member of the Politburo of the All-Union Communist Party); 6. Voznesensky (Chairman of the State Planning Commission); 7. Voroshilov (Chairman of the Control Committee for Hungary); 8. Malenkov (Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party); 9. Kaganovich, concurrently Minister of Railways; 10. Shadurov (Vice-Chairman of the State Planning Commission). The Council of Ministers is divided into various ministries to handle daily state administrative affairs. The Council of Ministers was called the "Council of People's Commissars" before March 1946.

　　Korean Supreme People's Assembly—It was elected by the people of North and South Korea on August 25, 1948. The first session of the Supreme People's Assembly was held in Pyongyang, North Korea, from September 2 to September 11, 1948. Kim Tu-bong, chairman of the North Korean Workers' Party, was elected as the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly. At this meeting, the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was adopted; Kim Il-sung, the leader of the North Korean Workers' Party, was elected as the Premier of the Cabinet of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and was granted the power to form a cabinet. From then on, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was formally established.

　　Far East—It is the eastern part of Asia. Geographers regard the junction of Europe and Asia as the midpoint. Some countries in western Asia are called the Near East, including Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, etc. Some countries in central Asia are called the Middle East, including Iran, Afghanistan, Balochistan, Saudi Arabia, etc. Some countries in eastern Asia are called the Far East, including China, Japan, India, Korea, etc.

    苏联集体农庄——苏联的农业自十月革命以后在“农业工业化”的口号下，由个体农业的小农业生产，变为集体的电气化、机械化生产，一跃而为世界上最大的社会主义农业国家。
    在十月革命前，俄国少数的剥削阶层——地主、皇族、僧侣、富农——占有土地二万万三千二百五十万公顷（每公顷合十六华亩），而农村劳苦大众仅占有一万万三千四百七十万公顷。百分之三十的农户没有马匹，百分之三——四没有农具，百分之十五没有种籽。每年有二百万以上的雇农，到处找工作。
    十月革命后，斯大林发展了列宁指示，完成了关于全面集体化及在此基础上消灭富农阶级的学说，规定了集体农庄为社会主义的农村经济形式。之后，小农业生产就逐渐走向集体化。一九二九年曾是大转变的一年。在千百万贫农中农参加下，全国展开了全面集体化。
    在第一个五年计划（从一九二八年开始到一九三二年完成）开始以前，个人经营的小农经济达二千万户以上（占全国农户的百分之九十五·六）。到一九三九年这些农户加入了二十四万一千个集体农庄，供他们永久使用的土地有十万万多英亩（一英亩合六华亩），如果把森林、池沼和牧场计算在内，每个集体农场平均有四千多英亩土地。
    由于电气化和机械化的结果，在一九四七年，农村设立的三千一百座发电站业已开动，决定去年和今年修复与新筑电站五十所，并将在较小的河流上设立集体农庄所属电站一万八千所，总发电量将达一百万基罗瓦特。一九四○年农场上有拖拉机五十二万三千架、现正争取明年再获得十一万二千架。
    在集体农庄里因为科学的分工和电气、机械的代替人力，使农民们节省了大量劳力，把工作时间缩短了，而有充分时间去学习、娱乐、休养。在苏联南部克里米亚那一个休养圣地，在过去只有皇帝、贵族和一般资产阶级才配去游玩，现在变成劳动人民的休养所了。在战前共有二千二百九十个疗养院和休养所，供数百万劳动人民疗养或在例假中休养游玩之用，在战争期间虽被敌人破坏了一千六百多所，但现已大部修复，劳动人民业已恢复了疗养休息的幸福生活。
    斯达哈诺夫运动——斯达哈诺夫，原来是苏联的一个煤矿工人；在一九三五年八月，苏联实行第二个五年计划的当中、斯达哈诺夫曾经在五小时又四十五分钟的时间内，挖出了一百零二吨煤。普通的挖煤工人，在同时间内只能挖十吨到十四吨；这就是说，斯达哈诺夫的生产效率超过了普通工人生产效率的六倍强。但是斯达哈诺夫也不过是一个普通年轻工人，体力上并没有比别人特别差异的地方，他的生产能力之所以能够如此提高，主要的是由于他是一个高度觉悟的工人，他在工作中不仅是从不浪费一分钟时间，而且还随时随地相尽了一切办法来改进工作技术，所以才创造了这样惊人的成绩。斯达哈诺夫的挖煤成绩一经传播出去以后，全苏联的各种产业部门的工人都争着学习斯达哈诺夫，自动地向斯达哈诺夫看齐，这就掀起了一个全苏联的工人群众的运动，这个运动，就叫做斯达哈诺夫运动。这一个运动一直继续到现在，成了全苏联的、以及一切新民主主义国家的、劳动工人的新方向，就是体力劳动与智力劳动的结合，使劳动走向合理化；换句话说，提高生产力，只靠体力劳动是有一定的限度的，更重要的是在研究、精通、改良生产技术。一九三五年斯大林曾经说过：“斯达哈诺夫式的工作者，是苏联工业的革新家”，又说：“这个运动包含有工人阶级将来文化的技术的高涨的种子”。这些话在今天看来，已经是完全实现了。由此，我们也可以知道斯达哈诺夫运动是有着如何的重要意义。
    白俄罗斯——苏联，本来是由十六个共和国组成的；白俄罗斯就是加盟共和国之一。它在苏联欧洲部分的西边边境，与波兰接壤。人口一千余万，首都明斯克，在西欧国家通达苏联的要冲地带，地位很重要，爱国战争期间，白俄罗斯曾经受到法西斯侵略者最残酷的破坏，现在因为战后第一个五年计划的逐步实行，一切工业、农业生产正向着超过战前水平的目标迈进。人民的生活，很快的恢复到战前水平并继续提高着。
    苏联部长会议——是苏联最高的国家行政机关。由联盟院、民族院联席会在代表中选举产生。部长会议的主席是斯大林，副主席共计十人，名单及其兼任的职务如下：一、莫洛托夫，兼外交部长，二、贝利亚，兼内政部长，三、安特列耶夫，兼农业部长，四、米高扬，兼对外贸易部长，五、科西金，兼轻工业部长（联共政治局委员），六、伏兹聂森斯基（国家计划委员会主席），七、伏罗希洛夫（管制匈牙利委员会主席），八、马伦可夫（联共中央书记），九、卡冈诺维支，兼铁道部长，十、沙杜鲁夫（国家计划委员会副主席）。部长会议下面分设各部，处理日常国家行政事务。部长会议，在一九四六年三月以前，称为“人民委员会”。
    朝鲜最高人民议会——是在一九四八年八月二十五日由北鲜、南鲜人民分别选举产生的。最高人民议会的第一次会议于一九四八年九月二日至九月十一日在北鲜的平壤举行。北鲜劳动党的主席金科凤当选为最高人民议会主席团的主席。在这次会议中，通过了朝鲜人民民主共和国的宪法；选出了北鲜劳动党领袖金日成为朝鲜民主共和国政府的内阁总理，并授与组阁权力。从此朝鲜民主共和国，就正式成立了。
    远东——就是亚洲的东部。研究地理的人，把欧亚两洲交界处当成中点，亚洲西部一些国家为近东，包括有土耳其、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、外约旦、巴勒斯坦等国。亚洲的中部一些国家为中东，包括有伊朗、阿富汗，俾路支、沙特阿拉伯等国，亚洲的东部一些国家为远东，包括有中国、日本、印度、朝鲜等国。
