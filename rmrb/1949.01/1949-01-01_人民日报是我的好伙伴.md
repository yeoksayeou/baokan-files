People's Daily is My Good Companion

To the Editor:

　　People's Daily has been my companion since the day it was born. I feel lost if I don't see it for a day and must look for it everywhere. This has also led to a sense of private ownership towards it. As soon as I see it, if I don't have time to read it immediately, I will put it in my pocket and wait until I have time to read it. I think it's okay to be a little selfish in learning, and I forgive myself. However, this reduces the amount of time other comrades can spend with People's Daily and hinders their learning. This is something that should be overcome ideologically.

　　I think the first and third editions must be read. This is just a belief that they must be read, and I do read them every time, but I don't particularly enjoy reading them in my heart, so I read them carelessly and superficially. But I like reading the fourth edition with joy. I hope you will publish more revolutionary stories in the form of literature and fiction, which will further encourage the working enthusiasm and writing interest of comrades. There are many inspiring and moving stories in China's War of Resistance Against Japan that have not been written. There are still many heroic performances in the self-defense war. It is good to publish stories from various battlefields in the newspaper constantly, as it is very inspiring. I remember that some comrades this spring were moved when they saw that there were still blackboard newspapers in the battle in Linfen, and the soldiers were so enthusiastic. So they also worked hard and started to study.

　　I don't really like to read the local editions. I have a perception (maybe it's wrong) that the newspaper sometimes doesn't give enough consideration to actual work and the Party's policies when publishing local news. For example, there was a lot of news about ×× during the land reform, and then there was a lot about them during the correction of deviations. Did they take the lead in the land reform movement, and then take the lead in correcting deviations? My personal sense of principle is not strong enough. In my work, as long as I see how ×× is moving, and think that my situation is similar to theirs, I just follow along. I didn't study the specific situation in my own area. I was just afraid of falling behind and simply transported things, so I made some mistakes in grasping policies in my work. After the Party rectification, I have prejudices whenever I see reports from ×× County and I don't read them. Therefore, I haven't been very enthusiastic about reading local news in the past year. I hope to correct these and strive forward.

　　人民日报是我的好伙伴
    编辑同志：
    人民日报从降生的那天起就成了我的伙伴，一日见不到它就感到如有所失，必须到处找它，因此也产生了对它的私有观念，只要见到它，若马上没有时间看，就会把它装在口袋里，等有时间再看，思想里认为在学习上自私些是没有什么的，自己宽恕了自己，但是把人民日报和其他同志的见面时间减少了，妨碍了其他同志的学习。这是应当从思想上很好克服的一点。
    我认为第一、第三版必须看，这只是认为必须看，也是每次必须看的，但是不是内心里特别喜欢看它，所以在看时就粗枝大叶，很草率的看一遍。而对于第四版是出于喜悦爱看。希望再多登些文艺小说体裁的革命故事，会更鼓动同志的工作热情和写作兴趣。中国在抗日战争中可歌可泣的事情很多，没有写出来；在自卫战争中这些英勇的表现还是很多，报纸上不断的发表一些各战场的故事，这是很好的，很能激动人的。我记得今春有的同志，看到临汾在战斗中还有门板报，士兵劲头那样大，我们的同志受到了感动，于是在工作中也起劲了，也开始学习了。
    我不很爱看地方版，我有一种认识（也许是错误的），我认为报纸登载地方消息，有时对实际工作和党的政策，考虑的不够。如××的消息在土改中他们的消息多，而在纠偏中又是他们的多，是不是在土改运动中他们带了头，而在纠偏中又带了头呢？我个人的原则性不够强。在工作中，只要看到××如何动，考虑一下和它的情况差不多，自己也就跟着动起来。没有根据自己地区的具体情形加以研究。只是怕落后，单纯的搬运，故在工作中掌握政策上犯了一些错误。在整党后每看到××县的报导思想上就有成见，也就不看了。因此我最近一年看地方版的消息也是不起劲的。希望改正这些，努力前进。
