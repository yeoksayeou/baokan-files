[From the Pingjin Front, 27th Dispatch] Before setting out, the laborers of Dacheng County underwent short-term training and enthusiastically volunteered for combat, their morale soaring. An emergency gathering was held in seven villages in the seventh district, and they all arrived on time from 11 PM to 6 AM. The fastest and best-equipped was Hanpi Village: they arrived at the assembly point at the first crow of the rooster. Their unanimous slogan was: "We will not return home until the task is completed!"

The masses in Beibatou Village, Jinghai, eagerly signed up to join the stretcher-bearer company and the ice-bed company. Whenever village accountant Song Zijun received a newspaper, he would read the news of victory to the young men. When they heard that Beiping was about to be liberated, they happily said, "We'll show off our skills then!" Song Zijun was the first to sign up, which motivated the village and inspired the young men of Nanbatou to spontaneously organize a stretcher-bearer team. During the review, Beibatou arrived the earliest, and Song Zijun declared on the spot: "I guarantee to lead our village's stretcher team and not return home until the task is completed!" Zhao the mute, who couldn't speak, drew a picture on the blackboard of a stretcher-bearer team heading towards Pingjin. Liu Heidan from Nanbatou challenged, "This time it won't be my turn to carry the stretcher. I've prepared the bed, I can shout loudly, and I can walk fast." Guo XX, a seventeen-year-old from Xiyuqiao, signed up for the army at a mass meeting, saying, "I won't carry a stretcher, carrying a stretcher is at the back. I'm joining the army to carry a gun." "Fighting on the front lines is more enjoyable than carrying a stretcher." Immediately afterwards, another young man also signed up. He Erdan's father said, "Good! Young men, don't give way to anyone!" Hearing this, He Erdan also signed up for the army.

　　大城民工争着参战
    【平津前线廿七日电】大城县民工出征前，经短期训练，挑战参战，情绪高涨。七区七个村举行紧急集合，从晚十一点到早六点都按时到齐。最快而且装备最好的是韩皮庄：头鸡叫就到达了集合点，他们一致的口号是：“不完成任务不回家。”
    静海北坝台村群众，争相报名，参加担架连、冰床连。村公所会计宋子俊每接到报纸，就把胜利消息念给青壮年们听，他们一听快解放北平，就高兴的说：“到时候咱们卖两手。”宋子俊头一个报了名。带动了本村，还鼓起了南坝台青壮年自动组织了担架班。检阅时，北坝台去的最早，宋子俊当场宣誓：“我保证带着俺村担架队，不完成任务不回家。”不会说话的赵哑叭，在黑板报上画着担架队的行列奔向平津的图画。南坝台刘黑旦挑战说：“这回轮不着我抬担架，我准备好床子，多会叫，多会走。”西于桥十七岁的郭××在群众大会上报名参军，他说：“我不抬担架，抬担架是在后头，我参军扛枪杆去。”“前线打仗去比抬担架还痛快。”紧接着又一个青年也报了名。何二旦他爹说：“好！青年小伙们，谁让谁呀！”何二旦听了，也报名参了军。
