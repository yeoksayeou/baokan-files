　　Neiqiu Spare-Time School Opens
    △In order to meet the new situation and implement the instruction on in-service cadre study, Neiqiu County, under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee's Propaganda Department, has established spare-time schools for various county-level organs. According to the different educational levels of cadres and support staff, and based on the principle of self-reporting and public discussion, they are divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Class A studies the history of social development, with self-study combined with discussion as the primary method. Class B focuses on improving cultural knowledge, temporarily studying Mandarin, arithmetic, history, and geography, relying on lectures as the method. Class C focuses on literacy, with concentrated study for one hour every morning. To ensure learning, regulations on leave and examination systems have also been stipulated. At the opening ceremony on the 9th of this month, everyone was in high spirits after Minister Zhang's mobilization and specific organization, and all were willing to actively strive to learn. All classes officially started on the 10th. (Liu Kuan, Li Feng, Pei Zhen, Feng Chuan)

　　内邱业余学校开课
    △为了迎接新的形势与执行关于在职干部学习指示，内邱县在县委宣传部统一领导下，已经成立了县级各机关业余学校。根据干部、勤杂人员文化程度的不同，在自报公议的原则下，共分为甲、乙、丙三个班。甲班学习社会发展史，方法以自学为主结合讨论。乙班以提高文化为主，暂学国语、算术、历史、地理，方法靠讲授。丙班以识字为主，每天午前集中学习一小时。为了保证学习，还规定了请假制度和考试制度。在本月九日的开学典礼大会上，经过张部长的动员与具体组织，大家情绪都很高，都愿意积极努力学习。从十日开始，各班都已正式开课了。（刘宽、李峰、培贞、凤川）
