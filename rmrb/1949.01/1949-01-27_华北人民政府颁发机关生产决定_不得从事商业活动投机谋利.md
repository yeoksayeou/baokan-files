The North China People's Government Issues Decision on Organ Production
　　No Engaging in Commercial Activities or Speculative Profiteering
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The North China People's Government issued a decision on organ production on the 18th and issued an order to its subordinates to implement it conscientiously. The instruction stated: It has been reported that many organ stores in various places have been taking advantage of recent price increases to hoard large quantities of grain and oil, preparing to engage in speculation in Tianjin and Peiping after our army liberates them, seeking high profits. This is one of the reasons for the recent price increases. Therefore, the "Decision on Organ Production" has been formulated, and governments at all levels must study it seriously and implement it conscientiously. The decision on organ production is as follows:
　　1. All organs are allowed to organize their own manpower to engage in handicraft and agricultural production, but they are not allowed to engage in commercial activities or hire labor for production.
　　2. In larger organs above the prefecture level, it is permissible to establish industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, employing workers for industrial production, and it is permissible to establish factory outlets to promote the sale of the factory's finished products and purchase raw materials for the factory, but they are not allowed to engage in other commercial activities (organ stores that have already been established will not be canceled for the time being).
　　3. Organ production as described above, which complies with government laws and decrees, cooperates closely with state trade organs, and opposes speculative manipulators in private capital and supports cooperatives under the guidance of industrial and commercial departments and state trade organs, should be regarded as operations of a new democratic nature. Banks may grant loans to the above-mentioned organ production in accordance with regulations, state trade organs should provide assistance, and should, within the scope of possibility, entrust them with certain businesses (such as entrusting the purchase of certain materials, entrusting the promotion of goods, etc.).
　　4. Those who violate the above-mentioned principles, do not abide by government laws and decrees, do not obey the guidance of industrial and commercial departments and state trade organs, engage in speculative manipulation in the market, or even engage in activities under false pretenses, or collude with private merchants to jointly oppose state trade organs and cooperatives, although their capital is public, their business methods are old capitalist methods and violate the principles of new democratic economic construction. They must be regulated and cracked down on economically and administratively, from persuasion and punishment to suspension of their business.
　　5. Governments at all levels, industrial and commercial departments, and trade companies must seriously and deeply study this decision and earnestly carry out the above-mentioned work, solve the existing anarchic phenomenon of organ production in the current markets, and organize organ production so that it becomes a force under the leadership of the state to oppose private speculation and manipulation and support cooperatives.

　　华北人民政府颁发机关生产决定
  　不得从事商业活动投机谋利
    【本报讯】华北人民政府十八日颁发关于机关生产的决定，并调令所属切实执行。训令称：据报各地近有不少机关商店利用近日物价上涨，大量囤积粮油，准备于我军解放平津后，到平津进行投机图谋高利，这是近日来物价上涨的原因之一，为此特制定“关于机关生产的决定”，各级政府必须认真加以研究，并切实执行。关于机关生产的决定如下：
    一、允许各机关组织本机关人力从事手工业农业生产，不得从事商业活动，不得雇佣劳动进行生产。二、在专署级以上较大机关中，准许举办有利于国计民生的工业，雇佣。庸工人进行工业生产，并允许设立推销本工厂生产成品、收购本工厂原料的工厂门市部，但不得从事其他商业活动（已成立之机关商店暂不取消）。三、上述机关生产，凡遵守政府法令，与国家贸易机关密切合作，在工商部门与国家贸易机关的指示下，共同反对私人资本中的投机操纵分子，扶植合作社者，应视为新民主主义性质的经营，对上述机关生产，银行可根据定章给予贷款，国家贸易机关应予以帮助，并应在可能范围内，委托其经营一定的业务（如委托收购某些物资、委托推销货物等）。四、凡违背上述方针，不遵守政府法令，不服从工商部门与国家贸易机关的指导，在市场上进行投机操纵，甚至假借名义进行活动，或与私商勾结共同反对国家贸易机关与合作社者，他们的资本虽然是公家的，但他们的经营方法，则是旧资本主义的方法，是违反新民主主义经济建设的方针的，必须从经济上及行政上予以管制和打击，从劝告处分直到停止其营业。五、各级政府及工商部门、贸易公司，必须认真的深入研究此一决定，并切实进行上述工作，解决目前各地市场上机关生产现存的无政府现象，并组织机关生产，使之成为国家领导下反对私人投机操纵支持合作社的力量。
