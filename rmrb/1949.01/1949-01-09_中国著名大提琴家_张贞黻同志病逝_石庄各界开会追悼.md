China's Famous Cellist, Comrade Zhang Zhenfu, Passes Away
Shijiazhuang Circles Hold Memorial Meeting

[Shijiazhuang News] Comrade Zhang Zhenfu, a famous Chinese cellist and member of the Communist Party, unfortunately passed away on December 24th at Peace Hospital in this city due to peritonitis. Comrade Zhang Zhenfu was born in Fenghua, Zhejiang in 1904. He graduated from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. He initially studied the violin, but due to hemoptysis caused by lung disease, he switched to the cello. Because of his diligence, he overcame many technical difficulties. Although he was often troubled by illness, he finally became one of China's leading cellists. In 1939, he went from Hong Kong to Chongqing. Because of his abhorrence of the political environment at the time, he went to Yan'an in 1944 and taught at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. Many people in the liberated areas today who have achieved success in violin and cello were students of Comrade Zhenfu. In Yan'an, under difficult material conditions, he founded a musical instrument factory. Comrade Zhenfu was the first person in Chinese music history to engage in musical instrument manufacturing as a musician. In 1946, he and Comrade He Luting organized the "Central Philharmonic Orchestra" and persevered in his work despite his illness. He eventually fell ill due to overwork and came to this city for treatment in the autumn of this year. Unfortunately, he ultimately developed peritonitis, which became incurable. He passed away on December 24th at the age of 44. The death of Comrade Zhenfu is a great loss to the Chinese people's musical cause.

On the 31st, all circles in this city held a memorial meeting and funeral. The arrangement of the mourning hall was extremely solemn. Comrade Zhenfu's portrait, surrounded by wreaths, was lifelike, further increasing sorrow. The mourning hall was filled with elegiac couplets from the North China Bureau, North China University, the Municipal Government, and other friendly organizations.

At the memorial meeting, Comrade Li Zhigan, representative of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau, delivered a speech, saying: "Comrade Zhenfu was a musician of the people, and he hated the enemies of the people. He was unwilling to be a blower for the exploiters in the old society. He threw himself into the embrace of the people, buried himself in hard work, and made the greatest efforts to build the people's musical cause!" He expressed that we should commemorate Comrade Zhenfu by learning from his working spirit and his art, and carry forward the people's musical cause.

Comrade He Luting reported on the life and deeds of Comrade Zhenfu. He was the most familiar with Comrade Zhenfu. Comrade Luting said: "Many years of friends and comrades, we were together until the end. He made a very deep impression on me." Comrade Luting used "honest and loyal" to describe our deceased musician. He did not want to show off or climb any position, and wholeheartedly served the people. Just before this illness, he said to the comrades of the music group: "Send a car to pick me up in half a month, I want to go back to work." Comrade Luting detailed Comrade Zhenfu's loyalty to the Party, his loyalty to the revolutionary cause, and his arduous working style, ending his words in a sorrowful tone.

Finally, Comrade Wu Liren of the Propaganda Department of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee suggested at the meeting that a musical instrument factory be established, and after the liberation of Beiping, it would be located in Beiping and named Zhenfu Musical Instrument Factory. Also, Comrade Zhenfu's belongings - his favorite books, creations, letters to various parties, and musical instruments he made himself - should be preserved to commemorate him. After the memorial meeting, all the representatives from all circles who attended the meeting escorted the coffin to the cemetery for burial.

  　张贞黻同志病逝
  　石庄各界开会追悼
    【石家庄讯】中国著名的大提琴家共产党员张贞黻同志不幸在十二月廿四日因腹膜炎病逝于本市和平医院。张贞黻同志一九○四年生于浙江奉化，在上海音专毕业，初学小提琴后，因肺病吐血改学大提琴，由于他的刻苦精神超越了很多技巧的困难，虽然常被病魔打扰，终于成为中国第一队的大提琴家。一九三九年由香港到重庆他因为嫉恨当时的政治环境于一九四四年到延安，在鲁迅艺术学院教课，今天解放区不少对小提琴和大提琴有成就的都出在贞黻同志的门下。在延安物资条件困难下创办了乐器工厂，在中国音乐史上以音乐家而进行乐器制造的，贞黻同志是第一人。四六年与贺绿汀同志组织“中央管弦乐团”，带病坚持工作，终因劳致疾，本年秋来本市医治，最后不幸转成腹膜炎，成不治之症，在十二月二十四日逝世，享年四十四岁。贞黻同志的逝世是中国人民音乐事业上一大损失。
    三十一日本市各界举行追悼会和殡葬灵堂布置得极为肃穆，贞黻同志的遗像在花圈围绕中翊翊如生，更使人增加哀思。灵堂满挂华北局、华北大学、市政府及其他各机关友好的挽联。
    追悼会首由华北局宣传部代表李之乾同志致词说：“贞黻同志是人民的音乐家，他痛恨人民的敌人。他不愿在旧社会里为剥削者作吹手，他投到人民的怀抱，埋头苦干，为建设人民的音乐事业而尽了最大的努力！”他表示我们纪念贞黻同志要学习他的工作精神，他的艺术，发扬人民的音乐事业。
    贺绿汀同志报告贞黻同志的生平事迹，他对贞黻同志是最熟稔的了，绿汀同志说：“许多年的朋友、同志，一直到最后还在一起，他给我的印象太深了。”绿汀同志引用“老实忠诚”，来形容我们逝世的音乐家，他不想出风头爬什么地位，一心一意地为人民服务。就在这次病前他还对音乐团的同志们说：“过半个月派车子来接我，我要回去工作。”绿汀同志详述了贞黻同志忠实于党，忠实于革命的事迹及其艰苦的工作作风，在沉痛的声调里结束了他的话。
    最后石庄市委宣传部吴立人同志在大会上建议，设立一个乐器工厂，等北平解放后设在北平，命名为贞黻乐器厂，及保存贞黻同志的遗物——他所喜欢的书籍、创作、给各方的书信、和他自制的乐器等以志纪念。追悼会后，参加会的各界代表全体送灵到墓地安葬。
