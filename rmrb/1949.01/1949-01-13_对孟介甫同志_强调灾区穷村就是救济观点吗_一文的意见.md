To the Editor:

Regarding the question raised by Comrade Meng Jiepu in the People's Daily, second edition, December 10th, "Is emphasizing poor villages in disaster areas just a relief perspective?" our opinions are as follows:

I. We believe that bank loans are generally production loans, serving production and construction; they are different from disaster relief loans, which serve disaster relief and helping people overcome famine. Disaster relief loans also organize disaster victims for production, but they take solving the current living needs of disaster victims as a prerequisite, using loans to organize disaster victims for production to achieve the goal of solving their living needs. Production loans, although they can also solve the problem of people's livelihoods, should take improving the industrial and agricultural production of the liberated areas as a prerequisite, using loans to organize the masses for production to achieve the goal of production and construction in the liberated areas. Therefore, production loans must first consider what is key to improving the industrial and agricultural production of the liberated areas by one inch. Then, concentrate efforts on one or several uses. The key is to proceed from the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood of the entire liberated area (of course, in addition to the overall key, each region has its own different priorities). Therefore, in terms of regions, it may be a disaster area, or it may not be a disaster area. Difficulties and needs cannot be generally raised without considering the uses we have prescribed, but should be determined based on the degree of the difficulties and needs of the masses within this scope to decide whether to grant the loan or not. If we emphasize disaster-stricken poor villages and first consider the problem with disaster-stricken poor villages as a prerequisite, it may not be suitable for the policy of improving the industrial and agricultural production of the liberated areas by one inch, and achieve the cause we advocate and support. As a result, the production we support will be blind from a construction perspective, and in fact, it will take the road of production for disaster relief. At the same time, it is easy to ignore production and encourage the occurrence of loan detachment from production, and waste. Of course, not emphasizing poor villages in disaster areas does not mean that we should emphasize non-disaster areas and non-poor villages.

II. Universal care is based on disaster-stricken poor villages. Precisely because in some places, we want to universally take care of disaster-stricken poor villages and poor households with our limited loans, the loans are quite dispersed. We have criticized this view, but does not emphasizing disaster-stricken poor villages necessarily prevent us from concentrating our resources? Of course not. Our concentrated use is not concentrated based on whether it is a disaster area or not, or whether it is poor or not, but concentrated based on purpose. Only in this way can loans be truly concentrated on the key to improving industrial and agricultural production in the liberated areas by one inch.

The above opinions are for everyone's research.

### 对孟介甫同志“强调灾区穷村就是救济观点吗”一文的意见

专栏：工作讨论

　　对孟介甫同志“强调灾区穷村就是救济观点吗”一文的意见编辑同志：
    关于十二月十日人民日报二版孟介甫同志所提问题：“强调灾区穷村就是救济观点吗”？我们意见如下：
    一、我们认为银行贷款一般的是生产贷款，是为生产建设服务的；不同于救灾贷款，为救灾渡荒而服务。救灾贷款也要组织灾民生产，但他以解决灾民目前生活为前提，是通过贷款组织灾民生产，而达到解决灾民生活之目的；而生产贷款虽然也可以解决群众生活问题，但应以为解放区工农业生产提高一寸为前提，通过贷款组织群众生产，而达到解放区生产建设的目的。所以生产贷款就必须首先考虑解放区工农业生产提高一寸的关键是什么？然后集中力量用在一种或几种用途上，关键是根据整个解放区的国计民生需要出发（当然除总的关键外，各个地区又有各个地区不同的重点），所以在地区上就可能是灾区，也可能不是灾区。困难与需要也不能离开我们所规定的用途而一般的提出，也应在这个范围内根据群众困难与需要程度而确定贷给与否。如果强调灾区穷村，首先以灾区穷村为前提来考虑问题，就不一定能适合解放区工农业生产提高一寸的方针，而达到我们所提倡与扶植的事业，结果扶植的生产，从建设意义上讲就会是盲目的，实际上走了生产救灾的道路。同时也容易忽视了生产，助长了贷款脱离生产，消耗浪费现象的发生。当然，不强调灾区穷村，也并不是又要强调非灾区非穷村的。
    二、普遍照顾是根据灾区穷村提出的，正因为有些地方，以我们有限的贷款要普遍照顾灾区穷村穷户，所以也就使贷款相当分散。我们批判了这种观点，但是否不强调灾区穷村而就不能集中了呢？当然也不是的。我们的集中使用，不是以灾区非灾区、穷不穷集中，而是以用途集中的。也只有这样，才能使贷款真正集中用在把解放区工农业生产提高一寸的关键上。
    以上意见，尚希大家研究。
