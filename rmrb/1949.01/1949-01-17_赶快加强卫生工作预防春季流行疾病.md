　　Hasten to Strengthen Sanitation Work to Prevent Spring Epidemics
　　Winter is ending, and spring is approaching. Various protozoa will gradually revive and multiply, and the prevalence of various infectious diseases is inevitable. Therefore, it is suggested that governments and health departments at all levels pay attention to this work. Especially in the new areas, the people's lives are extremely difficult under the enemy's devastation. The general public in rural areas lacks hygiene knowledge and disease prevention habits. Coupled with the imperfection of our health institutions and the general lack of medicine, the common people cannot afford medicine or doctors when they get sick, and this issue is even more worthy of attention. Some counties and districts have established medical cooperatives and achieved results. For example, the Fifth District of Yu County established a medical cooperative, enabling many poor people who could not afford medicine to receive treatment. The method is to obtain medicine on credit or to have the village provide a certificate for free treatment. At present, there is a shortage of medicinal materials, and the types are not many. Authentic medicinal materials from Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guizhou are lacking. Doctors cannot prescribe the appropriate medicine when seeing patients, which delays the patient's recovery and lowers the doctor's morale. For example, in the Yu County Medical Cooperative, some doctors were liquidated by the masses during the land reform and their morale is not high. Some have returned home, and some take turns working in the pharmacy, sometimes spending the whole day seeing patients and having to return to their own homes for meals, without any other benefits. As a result, they cannot take care of their families while seeing patients and cannot concentrate on their work. Some doctors also say, "Don't seek merit, but seek no demerit." This old consciousness has not yet been reversed.
　　Some private doctors, when going out to see patients, are afraid that the masses will not believe them. In order to make personal fortunes, they falsely claim to be government doctors. For example, a doctor surnamed Li from Changchi Village in the Ninth District of Yu County went to Xi Zhuang Village in the Fifth District of Yu County this spring and said, "The county sent me here to see patients and to inspect sanitation work." A patient in that village was seriously ill, and he said, "I guarantee I can cure him," and swindled a piece of cloth and some money away. As a result, the patient died.
　　There are also some pharmacies that lower drug prices to make more sales, but they do not give the original amount of medicine when dispensing it, or they give bad medicine. There are also such things happening. The total number of traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in Yu County was originally more than 200, but now there are only 70 or 80, not increasing but decreasing. The reason is that our organizational leadership is not sound, and doctors have to serve themselves all day long while seeing patients. In addition, bad elements spread rumors, deceiving many doctors and making them afraid to develop boldly. There are also many doctors turning to agriculture, or there is disunity among doctors, and conservative views are very strong, mutually excluding each other. Because many doctors in rural areas lack scientific knowledge and have poor technical skills, they cannot relieve the suffering of the masses, so the masses do not have a high belief in them. In a temple in Chengnanguan, Yu County, the masses constantly go to burn incense and kowtow, praying for their diseases to be cured soon. The same is true in Changchi Village in the Ninth District of Yu County, where the masses bring wine pots, cover them with red paper, go to temples to fetch cold water (so-called magic water), grab incense ash, shake bamboo sticks, and seek divine medicine. Xu Yuli Village in the Fifth District even hires witches, but nothing can be done. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen and improve the technology of doctors and instill new scientific knowledge. For this reason, I put forward the following suggestions:
　　1. Governments and health departments at all levels must pay attention to seasonal diseases, what medicines should be used, and how to actively prevent them.
　　2. We should improve organizational leadership, organize unemployed doctors, and enable them to actively serve the people. Strengthen unity and overcome the past conservative views and old ways of doing things.
　　3. According to the level of awareness of the masses, strengthen education and publicity, and widely carry out sanitation campaigns in close combination with large-scale production, such as sweeping street dirt and paving pigsties, which are both hygienic and accumulate fertilizer.
　　4. The burden of duty services for doctors should be reduced or exempted.

### 赶快加强卫生工作预防春季流行疾病

　　赶快加强卫生工作预防春季流行疾病
    冬季将终，春天接近，各种混原虫将要逐渐复活与繁殖，各种传染病的流行是必然的。因此建议各级政府和卫生部门，对这一工作加以重视。特别是新区，在敌人摧残下，群众生活极苦，农村中一般欠缺卫生常识和防病习惯，再加上我们卫生机构的不健全和普遍的缺乏医药，老百姓得了病吃不起药，请不起医生，这问题就更值得注意。有些县区建立了医药合作社，也收到了成绩：如盂县五区建立医药社，使好多吃不起药的贫苦群众也得到了医治。方法是抓药赊帐，或由村里证明，免费治疗。到现在药材不足，种类不多，川、广、云、贵地道药材缺乏，医生看药开方，不能该用什么开什么，致使病人延期不愈，医生情绪不高。如盂县县医药社，个别医生在土改中被群众清算后，情绪不高，有的回了家，有的在该药社轮流值日，有时整看一天病，还得回自己的家里吃饭，没有其他待遇。这样一来，顾了在外看病，顾不了家里的生活，也不得安心。还有的医生说：“不求有功，但求无过。”此种旧意识尚未扭转过来。
    还有的私人医生出去看病时，怕群众不相信他，为了个人发财，竟假借政府医生的名义。如盂县九区苌池村一个姓李的医生，今春到盂县五区下庄村，他说：“县上派我来此，一面看病，就便来检查卫生工作。”该村有一病人较重，他说：“保险能治好”，骗了一匹布和一些钱走了，结果病人也死了。
    还有一些药铺，为了多做买卖，药价较低，但不按原分量给抓药，或给坏药，这种事情也有。全盂县原有中西医二百余人，现只有七、八十人，不增光减。原因：由于我们组织领导不健全，医生整天在外看病，还得本人服勤务。再加上坏分子造谣，有不少医生受其欺骗，不敢大胆发展。还有不少的医生转向农业，或医生之间闹不团结，保守观点很浓厚，互相排斥。由于农村中有不少医生缺乏科学常识，技术能力亦较差，给群众解除不了痛苦，所以群众对其信仰亦不高。盂县城南关一寺院，群众不断去烧香磕头，求其疾病早日痊愈。盂县第九区苌池村亦是同样，群众持酒壶、盖红纸、去庙院装冷水（所谓法水）、抓香灰、摇竹箴、求神药。五区徐峪里村尚请巫婆，结果一点事也办不了。因此必须加强与提高医生的技术，贯输新的科学知识。为此，提出几点意见：
    一、各级政府和卫生部门必须注意季节病。应用些什么药品，如何积极预防。
    二、应健全组织领导，将失业的医生组织起来，使他们能积极为人民服务。加强团结，克服过去的保守观点及老一套的做法。
    三、根据群众的觉悟程度，加强教育宣传，广泛开展卫生运动与大生产密切结合，如打扫街土、垫圈，又讲了卫生，又积下肥。
    四、应减免医生本人之勤务负担。
