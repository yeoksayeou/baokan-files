    △A mobile hospital of the Ministry of Health of the North China Military Region, in order to further improve the political, ideological, and cultural level of the wounded and sick after being admitted to the hospital, once called on all wounded and sick to launch political and cultural studies at the soldiers' congress of two lightly wounded platoons. After the meeting, the leaders of the Second Platoon, according to the level of each squad, formed study groups based on the squad, and determined that those with higher levels should write diaries, and those with lower levels should learn to write characters. Some squads even drew up development tables for commendation and criticism on the walls of the hospital, which the wounded were very interested in. In particular, the daily political study combined with the current situation and tasks strengthened the confidence of the wounded and sick in winning victory in about a year, and made them realize that in the current development of the situation, whoever does not progress will fall behind the situation. Up to now, every comrade has improved politically and culturally.

　　卫生部某机动医院组织伤病员学习
    △华北军区卫生部某机动医院，为使伤病员入院后在政治上思想上文化上更进一步提高，曾在两个轻伤员连军人大会上，号召全体伤病员展开政治文化学习，会后二连领导上根据各班程度高低，以班为单位，编成学习小组，确定程度高者写日记，低者学生字。有的班并在院内墙上画上开展表扬、批评，伤员都很感兴趣。特别是每天一次结合当前形势和任务的政治学习，加强了伤病员明了一年左右胜利的信心，并认识了在当前形势发展中，谁不进步便会落在时局后面。到现在，每个同志在政治上，文化上都提高了。（“医院生活”）
