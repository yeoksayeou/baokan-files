　　To Meet the Needs of Cadre Study
  　Regulations Stipulate the Issuance of Book Subsidies
  　North China Government Issues Notice to Subordinates for Implementation
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Government issued a notice on the 12th, notifying all administrative offices (cities), all departments of the government, directly subordinate organs, and North China-level organs, groups, and schools, stipulating the issuance of five catties of millet per person (converted to cash) as a theoretical book subsidy. The notice stated:
    In order to meet the requirements of the situation, it is extremely important to improve the theoretical level of cadres. To solve the problem of cadres studying books, in addition to the originally stipulated study book and newspaper fees, governments and organizations at all levels should issue a book subsidy of five catties of millet per cadre during this theoretical study period, converted to cash. Each unit should manage this uniformly and purchase books in a planned manner, without issuing the funds to individuals. This book subsidy can be paid from the contingency funds of each level and included in the February budget. If a salary system has already been implemented, individuals should purchase books themselves, and no additional subsidies will be provided. As for schools under the supply system, the expenses can be paid from public miscellaneous fees or teaching fees, and no separate book subsidy will be listed. Please investigate and handle this accordingly! And inform your subordinates to comply!

　　适应干部学习需要
  　规定发给书籍补助费
  　华北政府通令所属办理
    【本报讯】华北政府于十二日发出通知，通知各行署（市）、该府各部门、直属各机关、华北级各机关团体学校，规定发给每人小米五斤（折款）作为理论书籍补助费，该通知称：
    为适应形势要求，提高干部理论水平至关重要，为解决干部学习书籍起见，除原规定之学习书报费外，各级政府机关、团体在此次理论学习期间，按干部人数每人发给书籍补助费小米五斤，折款发给，由各单位统一掌握，有计划的购买书籍，不把款发给个人。此项书籍补助费，可在各级预备费项下开支，列入二月份预算支领。如已实行薪金制者，由个人购买书籍，不再补助。至供给制之学校，可在公杂费或教学费项下开支，不另列书籍补助费。希即查照办理。并转告所属遵照！
