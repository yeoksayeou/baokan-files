Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 17th: Rear organs in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberated Area have, in an organized and planned manner, supplied large quantities of essential goods such as oil and salt to meet the needs of the Huaihai front-line troops. The Third Sub-district (southwest of Xuzhou) Industry and Commerce Bureau took the initiative in managing the procurement and transportation work. From November 30th to December 18th of last year, the Industry and Commerce Bureau allocated and sold 1,611,275 jin of sesame oil, 120,000 jin of salt, and a portion of native cloth, cotton, paper, and electrical materials to the front lines. This does not include direct supplies from Xuefeng, Xiaoxian, and Suxian counties.

When the Sixth Sub-district (north of the Ying River and south of the Wo River in the Huaihai area) carried out this work, the leading cadres personally took action and conducted in-depth inspections. The Commander, Political Commissar, and Commissioner of the sub-district collectively worked in the Logistics Headquarters, using telephones to guide procurement and transportation in various areas. The Deputy Secretary of the CPC Prefectural Committee personally went to the front lines to lead the work and transferred more than 220 cadres to participate in the grain station's work.

When the task of supplying 400,000 jin of flour daily was assigned to the Third Sub-district, the working cadres determined the different arrival times for each district based on its distance from the battlefield and the strength of its transportation capacity, ensuring that those closer to the war zone arrived first, and those farther away arrived later. Each district had time to organize manpower, ensuring a steady flow of flour to the front lines. At the same time, the method of contracting transportation with piece-rate wages was implemented, shortening transportation time.

The Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Third Sub-district established oil and salt supply stations in Xuefeng, so that troops did not have to purchase these items on the market. This not only stabilized prices, especially those centered on oil, but also sold oil to the troops at 20% below the market price and salt at 40% below the market price. They also purchased cigarettes, vegetables, and meat on behalf of the troops. By doing this supply work well, they not only solved military needs but also consolidated the credibility of the currency.

　　豫皖苏后方机关主动收购
  　大量必需品供应战地
    【新华社中原十七日电】豫皖苏解放区后方机关曾有组织有计划地以大量油、盐等必需品供应了淮海前线部队的需要。三分区（徐州西南地区）工商局主动掌握了收购运输工作。自去年十一月三十日起到十二月十八日止，经工商局拨供售予前方香油一百六十一万一千二百七十五斤、盐十二万斤及土布、棉花、纸张、电料等物品一部，雪枫、萧县、宿县等县的直接供应尚不在内。六分区（淮海颍河以北涡河以南）在进行此项工作时，首长们亲自动手，深入检查。分区司令员、政治委员、专员诸首长，在后勤司令部集体办公，用电话指导各地收购和运输。中共地委副书记亲到前方领导这一工作，并抽调二百二十多名干部参加粮站工作。当每日供给四十万斤面粉的任务布置到三分区时，工作干部即根据地区距战场的远近、运输力的强弱，定出各区送达目的地的不同时间，使离战区近的先到，离战场远的后到，各区均有时间组织人力，做到将面粉源源不断地送往前方。同时，在运输上实行包运计工发价的办法，缩短了运输时间。三分区工商局在雪枫建立油盐供给站，使部队可以不到市场上购买，不但稳定了以油为中心的物价，同时售给部队的油价低于市价百分之二十，盐低于市价百分之四十，并为部队代购需用的纸烟、蔬菜、肉类。由于做好了这些供应工作，不但解决了军需，而且巩固了货币的信用。
