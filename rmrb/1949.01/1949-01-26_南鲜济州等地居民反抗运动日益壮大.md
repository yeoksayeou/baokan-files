　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: The scale and momentum of the movement by residents of Jeju Island and other areas of South Korea against American imperialism and the Lee Seung-man puppet government are growing. The "Suppression Corps" which was suppressing the people's resistance, looted many peaceful villages that were supplying the people's armed forces with grain. However, despite the brutal reprisals, the democratic movement on Jeju Island cannot be suppressed. The Soviet "Red Fleet" newspaper reported: "The liberation struggle of the South Korean people has long had the character of an armed uprising. The armed struggle of Korean patriots for national freedom and independence is growing in strength and scale day by day."
　　Another dispatch: The Lee Seung-man "government" formulated a plan to "collect grain" from farmers, and sent military police to various places to plunder the stored grain of farmers below the level of rich peasants. However, due to the resistance of the farmers, the puppet government's grain grabbing plan has failed. The puppet government has only completed one-third of its grain hoarding plan.

　　南鲜济州等地居民反抗运动日益壮大
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社平壤讯：南朝鲜济州岛等地居民反对美帝国主义与李承晚傀儡政府运动的规模与声势日益壮大。镇压人民反抗的“讨伐大队”，曾洗劫了以粮食供应人民武装的许多和平村庄。但是，尽管残酷的报复，仍镇压不了济州岛的民主运动。苏联“红舰队”报称：“南朝鲜人民的解放斗争，很久以来就具有武装起义的性质。朝鲜爱国分子争取国家的自由与独立的武装斗争，在力量和规模上正与日俱增。”
    另讯：李承晚“政府”制订了向农民“征粮”的计划，并曾派军警赴各地掠夺富农以下的农民的存粮。然而，由于农民的抵抗，傀儡政府的抢粮计划已告失败。傀儡政府仅完成其囤谷计划的三分之一。
