Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS reports: On the eve of 1949, the Soviet capital was filled with joy and happiness. Moscow's streets were dazzling with advertisements and notices of all kinds inviting citizens to attend celebrations, dances, and banquets. Stores were crowded with customers buying New Year's goods. The stores were stocked with large quantities of fine wines and fruits specifically for New Year sales, and all goods were abundant. The "Red October" Candy Factory specially produced one million bags of candy for children. People are buying a large number of New Year's gifts—specially selected fine wines, fruits, candy gift packages, spices, and perfume gift boxes—to give to relatives and friends. Tens of thousands of Moscow citizens' homes will be brilliantly illuminated on New Year's Eve as the New Year trees light up with various colored lights. Some citizens will visit friends to welcome the New Year, while others will spend the evening at clubs or restaurants. More than two hundred clubs and "Houses of Culture" in the capital are preparing for New Year's Eve. The club of the "Hammer and Sickle" factory is decorated dazzlingly and can accommodate more than a thousand metallurgical workers, who will welcome the New Year in the spacious hall. The House of Culture of the Stalin Automobile Factory will hold a grand masquerade ball on New Year's Eve. The festival is a big event for young children. It coincides with the start of the school winter vacation. Many interesting games are being prepared for children: concerts, theatrical performances, ice skating, skiing trips, and entertainment around the New Year tree in schools, clubs, and parks. It is expected that more than 150,000 Moscow youth will participate in the annual celebration held regularly in the Trade Union Building during the winter vacation.

　　新年前夕的莫斯科
  　充满了欢乐与幸福的气氛  商店中货物丰裕顾客如云
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：一九四九年的前夕，苏维埃首都充满了欢乐与幸福的气氛。莫斯科大街因贴满了邀请市民参加庆祝会、舞会和宴会的广告和各色通告而光辉夺目。商店中购买年货的顾客如云。商店都运到大批专为新年销售的美酒和水果，一切货物都很丰裕。“红十月”糖果厂专门为儿童们生产了一百万个糖果袋。人们正选购大量的新年礼物——特备的精选美酒、水果、糖果礼品包、香料和香水礼品匣等，赠送亲友。数以万计的莫斯科市民家宅，除夕时将因新年树上亮起各种彩色灯光而灿烂辉煌。有些市民将在友人家中作客，迎接新年，而另外一些人则将在俱乐部或餐厅欢度此夕。首都二百多所俱乐部和“文化之家”，正为除夕作准备工作。“镰刀与锤子”工厂的俱乐部装饰得光辉夺目，可以容纳一千多冶金工人，他们将在广阔的大厅迎接新年降临。斯大林汽车工厂的文化之家，除夕将举行盛大的化装跳舞会。年节对幼童说是件大事。它与学校寒假的开始正相吻合。许多有趣的游戏，正为儿童准备着：音乐会，戏剧表演，溜冰会，滑雪旅行，以及在学校、俱乐部和公园的新年树周围举行的娱乐会。预计有十五万余莫斯科青年将参加一年一度的寒假中定期在职工会大厦举行的庆祝会。
