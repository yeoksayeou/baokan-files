Criticism and Suggestions

　　Villagers in Jiujie Village
　　Demand Village Financial Transparency
    Jiujie Village, in the fourteenth district of Pingding, is a small village of about a hundred households located on the railway and highway. In the past, it suffered under the tyrannical rule and exploitation of Yan Xishan and the Japanese. The people have only found peace since liberation last year. However, influenced by the tyranny of Yan Xishan and the Japanese, the village cadres have not made the finances public even after liberation, and there are still serious instances of waste and corruption.
    The village has collected village funds three times from the first month of this year until now. The first time, each person was assessed 12 liang of rice, totaling 403 jin of rice from the village's 537 people; the second time, it was based on the cultivated mu, with a total of 638 mu of land in the village, each mu assessed 2 jin of wheat; the third time (after the autumn harvest), each mu was assessed another 4 jin of rice, totaling 2,552 jin, so the three times totaled 4,231 jin.
    The village also sold 747 jin of rice from railroad ties, 102 jin of corn, and 1,238,000 yuan in border currency (equivalent to 800 jin of rice at the time), and also collected 320 jin of rice, for a total of 1,969 jin. When collecting public grain this autumn, each cultivated mu was assessed an additional 6 liang of rice, totaling an extra 120 jin of rice, more than 30 jin of black beans, and more than 300,000 yuan in border currency. The total of the above is equivalent to 5,350 jin of rice (wheat and beans), and more than 300,000 yuan.
    On the expenditure side, the village has one teacher, who was paid a total of 1,020 jin of rice over eleven months. Besides that, there is a remainder of more than 4,300 jin (excluding what was spent on cloth for the militia to make bullet belts, etc.). According to the villagers, "No itemized list has been issued since liberation." The villagers are not told how much money has been spent.
    The leadership of the fourteenth district should be responsible for investigating and correcting these instances of corruption and waste.

　　旧街村群众
  　要求村财政公开
    平定十四区旧街村是住在铁路汽路上的一个百十户的小村子，过去曾受尽阎、日暴政的统治搜括。去年解放后，人民才得安生。但该村干部因受阎、日暴政的影响，解放至今，财政仍未公开，还存在着严重的浪费和贪污现象。
    该村今年正月到现在共起了三次村款。第一次按每人摊米十二两，全村五百三十七人，共起四百零三斤米；第二次是按负担亩起，全村土地六百三十八亩；每亩摊了二斤小麦，第三次（秋后）每亩又摊四斤米，共起二千五百五十二斤，三次共起四千二百三十一斤。
    该村又卖道木米七百四十七斤，玉茭一百零二斤，边币一百二十三万八千元（按当时米价能量八百斤），又收米三百二十斤，共一千九百六十九斤。今秋起公粮时每负担亩又多摊了六两米，共多起米一百二十斤，黑豆三十多斤，边币三十多万元。以上共合米（麦豆）五千三百五十斤，款三十多万元。
    开支上，该村有一个教员，十一个月共支米一千零二十斤；此外剩四千三百多斤（民兵买了三匹布缝子弹带等在外）。据该村群众说：“自解放后到现在未出清单。”花了多少钱也不告诉群众。
    十四区的领导上应负责检查，纠正这些贪污浪费现象。
