Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 7th. The frontline and rear medical staff of the East China Field Army (Huaye) wholeheartedly serve the wounded in their work. The comrades of a certain hospital of the Field Army Health Department, who were working on the front line, achieved the "four fasts" work style of fast walking, fast preparation, fast transfer, and fast handover. In the pursuit battle, they marched one hundred and thirty li in a single night. The young and weak female comrades all insisted on keeping up with the marching speed. After arriving at the destination at dawn, they set up a transfer shed capable of holding 150 stretchers and a warm shed capable of accommodating more than 300 wounded in one day. Once, they were ordered to rush to a certain place to receive 350 wounded soldiers. After arriving at the destination, they immediately started working. Sixteen medical staff formed two dressing change groups and one equipment supply group. They changed dressings for all the wounded soldiers within half a day and completed general inspections and treatments. Approximately three-fifths of the seriously wounded were given broth, catheterization, and injections of tetanus antitoxin. Due to the heavy workload, many comrades disregarded all fatigue and often worked day and night without sleep. On a certain day, the Second Room of the Tenth Team of a certain hospital marched a hundred li at night and immediately started working at dawn. In the first half of the day, they arranged wards for 700 wounded soldiers and borrowed bowls, basins, and urine pots. In the afternoon, they completed the reception of more than 400 wounded soldiers, and in the evening, they changed dressings for the wounded soldiers. The next day, they continued to work as usual. Xu Yuying, a dressing worker from the First Squad of the Second Institute of a certain unit, served more than 100 wounded soldiers. For seven days and nights, she worked tirelessly washing large and small dressings, bandages, and clothes by the pond. Her hands were frozen and rotted from being immersed in water for a long time, but her work was still intense and uninterrupted. She was awarded the title of Second Class Merit. When the No. 7 ward of a certain hospital caught fire after being bombed by enemy planes, six people including Miao Zhengjiao from the hospital rushed into the ward amidst the raging fire and rescued all ten seriously wounded soldiers who were lying down and unable to move. During the rescue, the eyes of comrades such as Liu Gengxin were injured by smoke and fire, but they still groped and rescued the wounded soldiers with their eyes closed. Under the call of "Everything for the Wounded Soldiers," the members of the transportation team of a certain department of the Health Department actively signed up to donate 8,034 cc of blood to the wounded soldiers. In a letter to the political commissar of the regiment, the team said: "In future battles, we can immediately draw more blood to contribute to the recovery of the wounded comrades." More than 70 male and female staff members of the health department of a certain division voluntarily signed up to donate blood to the wounded soldiers. When the doctor successfully tested the blood type, they immediately extended their arms to the doctor. Qian Jinyun, the nursing squad leader, was a third-class disabled person, but he also resolutely requested a blood transfusion and had 200 cc of blood drawn. The blood-donating comrades placed infinite hope on the blood-receiving wounded soldiers. When they saw that the seriously wounded soldiers who were sleeping had slightly red lips, pulsating pulse, and stable breathing, they worked even more happily.

　　华野卫生人员作风好
  　做到快走、快准备、快收转、快移交。
    【新华社淮海前线七日电】华东野战军前线和后方的卫生工作人员，在工作中全心全意为伤员服务。野战军卫生部某院在第一线工作的同志，做到了快走、快准备、快收转、快移交的“四快”的工作作风。他们在追击战中，一夜急行军一百三十里，年幼和体弱的女同志均坚持跟上行军速度。拂晓到目的地后，一天内搭好能容一百五十付担架的转运棚和可收三百余伤员的暖棚。有一次他们奉命赶到某地接三百五十名伤员，到达目的地后立即开始工作，由十六个医务员组成两个换药组、一个器材供给组，半天内将全部伤员换好药，并作完了一般检查处理，其中约占五分之三的重伤员都被施行了灌汤、导尿、注射破伤风抗毒血清。由于工作任务繁重，许多同志不顾一切疲劳，常常昼夜不眠。某院十队二室，某日夜行军百里，天明立即工作，上半天布置好能住七百名伤员的病房并借好碗、盆、尿罐等用具，下午又完成四百余名伤员的接收工作，晚上又替伤员换好药，第二天仍照常工作。某部二所一小队敷料员徐育英为一百多名伤员服务，七昼夜废寝忘食地在池塘边洗涤大小敷料绷带衣服等，他的双手在水中浸久冻烂，工作仍一样紧张不停，被评为二等功臣。某院七号病房被敌机投弹着火时，该院缪政教等六人冒烈火冲进病房，将十名躺着不能动的重伤员全部救出。抢救中刘更新等同志双目为烟火薰伤，但仍闭着眼摸索救出伤员。卫生部某部担运队在“一切为了伤员”的号召下，队员纷纷自动报名为伤员输血八千零三十四西西。该队给团政治委员的信中说：“今后战斗中，我们可立即抽出更多的血来供献给伤员同志恢复健康。”某师卫生部七十余男女工作人员自动报名要求输血给伤员，当医生检验血型成功后，手臂立即伸在医生眼前。护理班长钱金运是个三等残废，也坚决要求输血，抽了二百西西。输血同志对受血伤员，寄以无限热望，当他（她）们亲眼看到正睡着的重伤员，嘴唇微微发红，脉膊跳动、呼吸平稳时，就更加愉快的加紧工作了。
