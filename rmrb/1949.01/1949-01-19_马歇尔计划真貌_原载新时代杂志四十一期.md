　　IV. The Dollar – Source of Strife

　　Internal European trade is far below pre-war levels. In 1947, internal European trade accounted for only one-sixth of total world trade, compared to one-third before the war.

　tThis decline cannot be entirely attributed to the consequences of war damage; it is largely the result of the dollar's dominance over Western European countries. Enduring long-term dollar deficits, these countries desperately export, mainly to the dollar zone, even if it conflicts with their own interests.

　　The dollar thus suffocates internal European trade, preventing its recovery and development. Of course, this situation only benefits Wall Street giants. The smaller the chance of internal European trade recovery, the greater the chance for the post-war U.S. exports to remain at abnormally inflated levels.

　　In the spring of this year (1948), Western European countries attempted to break free from their shackles. In May, Britain suggested creating a currency clearing system among the Marshall Plan countries – effectively avoiding dollar payments. In this way, potential internal European trade surpluses could be balanced among Western European countries, and internal European trade could be partially freed from dollar control. But Britain's suggestion was immediately dismissed. The cunning British could not deceive Wall Street. The mere threat of suspending Marshall Plan aid was enough, and the mild resistance was suppressed. Internal European trade remains bound by the dollar's chains.

　　But the situation is rapidly deteriorating. Even the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) were forced to halt trade between themselves. Under the pressure of necessity, the Belgian and Dutch governments "agreed" that Belgium's exports to the Netherlands should be reduced by 14 percent between July 1st and October 1st, 1948. Why? Because the Netherlands could no longer pay for its trade deficit with Belgium in dollars or gold – which amounted to nearly 21 million guilders (Dutch currency – translator) per month.

　　To reassure the beneficiaries, American monopolists came up with a remarkable conspiracy – deceiving the public by claiming this was a significant concession for "European interests." Based on Hoffman's proposal, Western European governments obsequiously approved the suggestion that any Marshall Plan country that has a trade surplus with another Marshall Plan country can henceforth obtain an interest-free dollar credit loan from the United States, equivalent to the amount of its surplus. This regulation came into effect on October 1st of this year (1948).

　　But this is just another trick – a rather blatant one. Because it is very obvious that the American authorities will again subsidize European exports that do not involve American companies. Under the guise of encouraging European trade, American commercial interests easily obtain another method of influencing and controlling the flow of goods in Western Europe.

　　And that's not all. Precisely because Marshall Plan appropriations only tend to exacerbate the dollar deficits of Western European countries, the dollar fund, originally intended to encourage internal European trade, is merely used to more surely strangle internal European trade altogether.

　　It is not difficult to foresee the consequences of the new dollar credit for surpluses. Every Western European country that increases its exports to other Marshall Plan countries will naturally strive to minimize its imports from these countries as much as possible to maintain its surplus to the maximum extent. But one Western European country's exports are another country's imports. Therefore, each country's tendency to tighten its imports will actually make it impossible for them to increase their total exports to another country. In promising Marshall Plan countries a dollar credit for internal European surpluses, Wall Street is merely sowing the seeds of discord among them.

　　It will not help the recovery of internal European trade in the slightest. The only truly effective way to raise internal European trade to pre-war levels is through multilateral trade, whereby each European country's surplus will increasingly tend to be balanced in their overall trade. The proposed American system will never lead to this goal. On the contrary, it will further reduce internal European trade; it only seeks to make Western European countries use the dollar credit they receive to increase their imports from the United States.

　　It is not difficult to foresee that the approval of credit for surpluses will be used by American monopolists to further undermine commercial ties between Eastern and Western Europe. American monopolists are working to completely destroy these ties, believing that it will hinder the economic development of Eastern Europe and make Marshall Plan countries more dependent on the dollar. Wall Street agents have compiled long lists of goods that are strictly prohibited from being exported to Eastern Europe, ostensibly to prevent the growth of Eastern Europe's "war potential." But the real purpose is to prevent normal trade between Eastern and Western Europe. The first to suffer are the Marshallized countries, as this discriminatory policy deprives them of favorable markets and reliable sources of raw materials.

　　Even the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe admitted in its recent report that trade between Eastern and Western Europe could increase fivefold compared to its current volume. Many goods currently shipped from the dollar zone can be obtained from Eastern Europe, and on more favorable exchange terms. But alas, there is an obstacle – it would mean the cessation of dollar deficits, and thus the end of the Marshall Plan.

　　V. Exploitation and Plunder Under the Guise of Benevolence

　　The story of the Marshall Plan's benevolent nature is based on American food aid to Western Europe. Wall Street's concept of benevolence is worth considering. It is in itself a significant fact that this aid began not when Europe's food shortage was at its worst, but when the entire capitalist world showed the first signs of returning to pre-war agricultural overproduction. Only then did American monopolists see the tragic food shortage in Western Europe and devise an aid plan. But this was aid to American profiteers, not aid to Europe.

　　The efforts of American capital to maintain the astonishingly high prices of manufactured goods are well known. But once agricultural product prices begin to fall, this becomes impossible. To maintain an inflated level requires a more tightly controlled overseas market. In this way, American agricultural products can be exported there at any price. And this is precisely the purpose of the Marshall Plan. American grain speculators, as long as they can continue to rake in astonishing profits, intend to keep the cost of living for the masses at frighteningly high levels.

　　Given the current state of the world food market, this plan of the American imperialists is even more hateful. Last year, 1947-48, the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall Plan imported 17.4 million tons of wheat. This year (1948), thanks to a good harvest, they will only need to import about 9.3 million tons. Even with higher consumption standards, their imports will hardly exceed 13.6 million tons. This is almost exactly the figure that the Marshall Plan countries imported from the United States and Canada in 1947-48.

　　One would naturally predict that Britain and other Western European countries will obtain large quantities of American and Canadian wheat under the Marshall Plan appropriations, and have already signed contracts at current speculative prices. But wheat from Argentina, Australia, and other countries will be sold on the world market at much cheaper prices. As a result, Marshallized countries will continue to endure a painfully high cost of living and crippling dollar trade deficits this year.

　　Of course, Western European countries – especially Britain – could try to purchase only a portion of their grain at the inflated prices stipulated in the Marshall Plan contracts, and purchase the rest at cheaper world prices. However, the predatory nature of the Marshall Plan would be clear even to the blind. It is dooming Europe to long-term malnutrition.

　　Clearly, without the Marshall Plan, Western European countries would be in a much better situation. What they would lose in refusing American appropriations would be compensated by the restoration of world prices to normal. This tempting prospect even led the London Times to write an editorial on June 30th to this effect. Given that Britain's foreign deficit this year (1948) will reach 500 million pounds, while Marshall Plan appropriations will only reach 230 million pounds, the newspaper feigned indifference, saying:

　　"Therefore, some may say that the aid is not so great that it is unbearable to abandon. They may argue that if aid is refused, the prices of food and raw materials are bound to fall, because world purchasing power has decreased; and the consequences of falling prices may be very profound, because, if this country's finished product export prices and her raw material import prices return to the relationship of 1938, the foreign deficit will be reduced by more than 200 million pounds a year – that is to say, about equivalent to the first year's appropriations of the aid plan."

　　A simple calculation, and the Times did not refute the argument spoken through the mouths of others. It only hinted that the Marshall Plan has larger political and strategic goals, as for the economic advantages and disadvantages, it is "not the last consideration. The Marshall Plan is to unite Western European countries together to become a strong and unified force in Europe."

　　The Times even seemed to have no doubt about what a powerful judgment it made on America's "aid" and other beneficiaries. It said that the Marshall Plan not only perpetuates high living costs, numerous difficulties, and foreign trade deficits in the sixteen countries, but is also aimed at directly leading to new wars. A comforting revelation for British readers.

　　But all these sophistries cannot change the fact that it is precisely because the Western European rulers themselves agreed to subject their countries to Marshall Plan servitude that they prolonged the post-war famine and poverty.

　　VI. A Building Built on Shifting Sands

　　From the above, the Marshall Plan represents an attempt by American plutocrats to delay the arrival of the American economic crisis to some extent, while economically disarming Western Europe in order to advance their plan for world hegemony. But the initial stages of the plan revealed how slim the chances of success were. Despite all precautions, the pointer of American commercial activity is relentlessly moving towards the danger point – at which time the current inflationary prosperity will be in vain. This collapse is bound to deal a major blow to the Marshall Plan.

　　The fierce debates surrounding the initial Marshall Plan appropriations, and the elimination of the period and amount originally approved by Congress, demonstrate the inconsistent attitude within the American ruling group towards the Marshall Plan. The American budget is not an inexhaustible money bag. Although most of the plan's expenses are borne by all taxpayers, that is, by the working people, only a handful of exporters exclusively enjoy its benefits. As for those monopoly capital groups that rely mainly or entirely on the domestic market, they opposed the Marshall Plan appropriations this spring, on the grounds that it would limit the purchasing power of the American people, who are the source of their profits.

　　These doubts were forced to remain silent, partly because they were reminded of the threat of an economic crisis, which would further limit the domestic market. But the first shock of the crisis is bound to bankrupt the Marshall Plan, which serves as a preventative measure against economic turmoil. Therefore, this massive speculative venture will prove to be an unprofitable and unbearable burden for the United States.

　　马歇尔计划真貌
  　原载新时代杂志四十一期
    Ｕ·卡什洛夫  黄炳辉译
    四、美元——倾轧之源
    欧洲内部的贸易远低于战前的水平。在一九四七年，欧洲内部的贸易仅占世界贸易总额的六分之一，在战前却是三分之一。
    这个降低不能完全归因于战祸的后果，它绝大部分是西欧各国为美元统治的后果。忍受着长期的美元亏空，这些国家拚命输出，主要是对美元区，甚至与本身利益抵触也好。
    美元就是这样窒息着欧洲内部的贸易，防止其复原发展。当然，这种形势只能有利于华尔街巨头们。欧洲内部贸易的复原机会愈小，保持在反常膨胀水平上的美国战后输出的机会也就愈大。
    在今（一九四八）春，西欧国家曾企图摆脱其桎梏。英国在五月里，曾建议各马歇尔国家间创立一个彼此划汇的制度——实际上是避免以美元付款。这样，可能的欧洲内部出超便能在西欧国家间达到平衡，欧洲内部的贸易便能解除一部分的美元控制。但是英国的建议立即被取消。狡猾的英国是骗不过华尔街的。单是威胁停止马歇尔计划的援助便足够了，温和的反抗镇压下去了。欧洲内部的贸易仍受美元枷锁的束缚。
    但是形势更日益急转直下。连布鲁塞尔三国（比、荷、卢）亦被迫停止她们之间的贸易。在需要的压力下，据说比、荷政府“同意”比利时在四八年七月一日到十月一日间对荷兰的输出应减低百分之十四，为什么呢？因为荷兰再不能以美元或黄金支付其对比利时的入超——每月几达二千一百万盾（荷币名——译者）。
    为了安定受惠人，美国独占资本家想出了一个显著的阴谋——向社会骗说这是对“欧洲利益”的一个重大让步。根据霍夫曼提出的建议，西欧各政府逢迎地批准了这个建议，任何马歇尔计划国家今后如对其他马歇尔计划国家出超，可以从美国得到一笔相当其出超数额的无利息美元信用贷款。这个条例于今（一九四八）年十月一日开始生效。
    但这只是另一个诡计——一个相当率直的诡计。因为很明显的，美国当局将又会资助不波及美国各公司的输出的欧洲本部的输出。在鼓励欧洲贸易的伪装下，美国商业利益简易地取得影响与控制西欧货物流通的另一方法。
    还不止这样。正因马歇尔计划拨款只倾向于加甚西欧国家的美元亏空，所以原意是为了鼓励欧洲内部贸易而设立的美元基金，只不过是用以更有把握地整个窒杀欧洲内部的贸易而已。
    不难预见出超的新美元信贷将导向何种结果。每个增加对其他马歇尔计划国家的输出的西欧国家，自然力求尽可能减少对这些国家的输入，以保持其出超到最大限度。但是此一西欧国家的输出便是另一国家的输入。因此每个国家紧缩其输入的趋势，实际上将使她们不可能增加其对另一国家的总输出。在答应马歇尔计划国家一个欧洲内部出超的美元信贷中，华尔街只是在她们当中种下了不睦之源。
    它将丝毫无助于欧洲内部贸易的复原。提高欧洲内部贸易到战前水平的唯一真正有效方法便是多边的贸易，借此，每个欧洲国家的出超将愈加倾向于在她们全体的总贸易中得到平衡。所建议的美国制度将绝不能走向这个目的。相反的，它将使欧洲内部的贸易更为减少；它只是要使西欧国家用得到的美元信贷来增加她们对美国的输入。
    不难预见批准对出超的信贷，将被美国独占资本家用来更进一步破坏东西欧的商业联系。美国独占资本家正致力彻底摧毁这些联系，相信它将阻碍东欧的经济发展，使马歇尔计划国家更依赖美元。华尔街的代理人编制出长长的商品单，这些商品是严禁输往东欧的，表面的理由是防止东欧的“战争潜力”增长。但其真正目的却是阻止东西欧的正常贸易。首遭其害的是马歇尔化的国家，这个歧视政策断绝了她们的有利市场和可靠的原料来源。
    甚至联合国欧洲经济委员会也在其最近发表的报告上承认，东西欧的贸易能比其现在的数量增加五倍。可以从东欧取得许多现在从美元区运来的货物，而且是在更有利的互换条件下。但是天呀，这里有一个障碍——它将意味着美元亏空的中止，因而马歇尔计划就得完蛋。
    五、仁慈伪装下的取巧豪夺
    马歇尔计划的仁慈性质的故事系基于美国对西欧的粮食援助上。华尔街的仁慈观念是值得考虑的。它本身就是一个有意义的事实，就是这些援助开始的时候，不是在欧洲粮荒最严重的时候，而是当整个资本主义世界出现了回到战前农业生产过剩的第一征兆的时候。只是因此，美国独占资本家才看到西欧的悲惨的粮荒，才拟制出一个援助计划。但这是援助美国牟利者，不是援助欧洲。
    美国资本的力图维持制成品的惊人高价已是大家都知道的。但一旦农产品价格开始跌落时，这便成为不可能了。要保持一个膨胀的水平，就需要一个更严密的独占国外市场。这样，美国农产品才能以任何价格输往那里。而这个完全不是马歇尔计划的目的。美国的粮食投机商，只要他们能继续刮得惊人的利润，他们是打算保持群众的生活费在高得可怕的水平上。
    鉴于世界粮食市场的现况，美帝国主义者的这个计划更为可恨。去年，一九四七——四八年，参加马歇尔计划的西欧十六国输入一千七百四十万吨小麦，今（一九四八）年，靠了一个好年成，她们将只需要输入约九百三十万吨。就算加上较高的消耗标准，她们的输入将难得超过一千三百六十万吨。这几乎正是马歇尔计划国家于一九四七——四八年从美国和加拿大输入的数字。
    自然会预测到英国及其他西欧国家将在马歇尔计划拨款下，取得大量的美国和加拿大小麦，而且已经照现在的投机价格订下合同。但阿根廷、澳洲及其他国家的小麦，将以贱得多的价钱在世界市场上抛售。因之，马歇尔化的国家今年仍将忍受着一个悲痛的高昂生活费和瘫痪的美元贸易入超。
    当然，西欧国家——特别是英国，可以试图按照马歇尔计划合同规定的过高价格，只购进一部分粮食，其余的照便宜的世界价格购买。然而马歇尔计划的劫掠特性将是连瞎子也看得很清楚的。它正注定了欧洲长期处于营养不良中。
    明显地，没有马歇尔计划，西欧国家的境遇将要比现在好得多。她们在拒绝美国拨款上所将损失的，将由世界价格恢复常态得到补偿。这个诱人的远景甚至引得伦敦的泰晤士报在六月三十日为此写了一篇社论。鉴于英国今（一九四八）年的对外亏空将达五万万镑，而马歇尔计划拨款只达二万万三千万镑，该报故作冷淡的说：
    “因此也许有人说，援助并非大到使人不忍割弃。他们也许争辩说，如果拒绝援助，粮食和原料价格势必跌落，因为世界购买力降低了；而物价跌落的后果也许是很深大的，因为，如果这个国家的成品输出价和她的原料输入的价格回复到一九三八年的关系上，一年便将减少对外亏空达二万万镑以上——即是说，约相当于所得到的援助计划的第一年拨款”。
    一个简单的计算，而泰晤士报并未反驳其借他人之口所说出来的论点。它只是暗指马歇尔计划具有更庞大的政治、战略目标，至于经济的利与不利，却是：“不在最后考虑之列。马歇尔计划乃谋把西欧国家联成一起，成为欧洲的一个强大的统一力量”。
    泰晤士报甚至似乎不曾怀疑到它对美国的“援助”及其他受惠者，作出一个何等有力的判断。它说，马歇尔计划不仅永使十六国的生活费高涨、重重困难和对外贸易的亏空，而且也是旨在直接导向新战争。一个使英国读者舒怀的启示。
    但所有这些诡辩不能改变事实，即正因西欧统治者自己同意使自己国家落入马歇尔计划苦役中，才延长战后的饥荒与贫困。
    六、筑在浮沙上的大厦
    由上观之，马歇尔计划代表着美国巨富企图多少要拖延美国经济危机的到来，同时在经济上解除西欧的武装，以推进其世界霸权的大计。但计划开始的初期便透露出成功的希望是多么渺茫。虽尽了一切的预防，美国商业活动的指针正无情地移向危险点——那时，目前通货膨胀的繁荣将归乌有。这个崩溃定予马歇尔计划一个重大的打击。
    围绕着马歇尔计划初期拨款的激烈争辩，和消灭国会原来批准的期间与数目，表现出美国统治集团内部对马歇尔计划的态度亦不一致。美国的预算案不是个取之不尽的钱袋。虽然计划的经费大部分由全体纳税人负担，亦即劳动人民来负担，但只有数不盈握的出口商独享其利。至于那些主要或全部倚靠国内市场的独占资本集团，在今年春天便已反对马歇尔计划拨款，理由是这将限制了他们利润来源的美国人民的购买力。
    这些怀疑被迫保持缄默，部分地系由于被提醒了经济危机的威胁，这个危机必将更大地限制国内市场。但危机的第一个震撼，定将使作为防止经济骚乱的马歇尔计划破产。因此，这个庞大的投机冒险，将证明是美国的一个无利的、难忍的负担。
