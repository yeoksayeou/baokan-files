　　Jinpu Railway—A major railway parallel to the Pinghan Railway, it is 1,887 li long. Construction began in the 34th year of the Guangxu reign (1908) by the Germans, and later continued by the British. It was completed and opened to traffic in the first year of the Republic of China. The railway starts in Tianjin, Hebei Province (currently under siege by our army), and passes through 14 cities and counties, the larger ones including Cang County in Hebei Province, Dezhou and Jinan in Shandong Province, and Xuzhou, recently liberated by our East China People's Liberation Army. It continues south through Bengbu in Anhui Province, reaching Pukou in Jiangsu Province, which faces Nanjing across the river. After the liberation of Xuzhou, thanks to the high level of enthusiasm of our railway workers and the assistance of the people along the railway, the 720-li Jinan-Xuzhou section of the railway began operating on December 21st of last year. The entire line from Tianjin to the south and Bengbu to the north has been liberated.

　　Beining Railway—A total length of 1,322 li, it runs from Beiping through Tianjin, Tanggu, Tangshan, Luanxian, Changli, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan into Liaoning Province in Northeast China, passing through Suizhong, Jin County, Goubangzi, Dahu Mountain, Xinmin, and ending in Shenyang. Except for Beiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu, which are currently under siege by our army, all the above towns and cities have been liberated by our army. Construction of this railway began in 1881, initially only the Tangshan section for coal transportation. It was later extended to Tianjin and Shanhaiguan. In 1895, a loan from Britain was used to build the Beiping-Tianjin section. In 1899, it was extended to Jinzhou in the Northeast, and later the section from Xinmin to Shenyang, originally built by Japan, was acquired, completing the entire line. Full operation began in 1901. During this time, Chiang Kai-shek carried out an anti-people civil war, constructing fortifications and extensively destroying the railway along its route. Our railway workers are now actively repairing it.

　　Longhai Railway—The longest railway in China within the customs, it spans approximately 4,000 li, running west from Haizhou in Jiangsu Province through Xuzhou, Dangshan, Minquan, Lanfeng, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xingyang, Yanshi, Luoyang, Xin'an, Mianchi, Shan County, Lingbao, and Tongguan into Shaanxi Province, passing through Huayin, Hua County, Weinan, Lintong, Xi'an, Xianyang, Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, and Fengxiang to Baoji, entering Gansu Province, passing through Tianshui, Wugong, Longxi, and Weiyuan to Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province (the Tianshui-Lanzhou section is not yet completed). This railway passes through four provinces: Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Construction began section by section in 1903 using loans from Belgium. Approximately 1,553 li of the railway line from Haizhou to Tongguan are under our army's control. Thanks to the efforts of railway workers in restoration, the section from Xuzhou to Luoyang is now open to traffic.

　　Pinghan Railway—Originally called the Jinghan Railway, it was built with loans from Belgium in 1894. Later, loans from Britain and France were used to repay the Belgian loans. Initially running from Hankou to Lugouqiao, it was later extended to Beiping. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Pinghan Railway and is also one of the major railways within the customs, approximately 1,800 li long. Full operation began in 1901. After its opening, north-south transportation became much more convenient. Important towns along its route include: Hankou, Xiaogan, Huayuanzhen, and Wushengguan in Hubei Province; Xinyang, Minggangzhen, Queshan, Suiping, Xiping, Luohezhen, Linying, Xuchang, and Xinzheng in Henan Province. It intersects with the Longhai Railway in Zhengzhou, and crosses the Yellow River via the Yellow River Iron Bridge, China's first major iron bridge. Further north, it passes through Xinxiang, Jixian, Qixian, Tangyin, Anyang, Ci County, Handan, Xingtai, Neiqiu, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, Shijiazhuang, Zhengding, Xinle, Ding County, Wangdu, Baoding, Xushui, Dingxing, Zhuo County, Liangxiang, and Wanping, arriving in Beiping. The northern section of the Pinghan Railway, from Beiping to Zhengzhou, has been basically completely liberated, with only Anyang and Xinxiang remaining as isolated strongholds. Beiping will also be liberated soon. To the south of Zhengzhou, the line has been restored to Xinzheng and is being actively repaired towards Xuchang and Luohe.
