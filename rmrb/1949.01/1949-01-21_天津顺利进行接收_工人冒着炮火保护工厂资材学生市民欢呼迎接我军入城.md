Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th. Workers, students, and citizens of Tianjin are warmly welcoming the People's Liberation Army. While the battle was still ongoing, many workers braved the shelling to protect their factories and machinery. Employees of the Central Machine Factory organized pickets to take turns guarding materials. Workers at the Public Transportation Administration sent all trucks into the workshops to prevent damage. Of the three power plants of the Ji'bei Electric Power Company, all but the second plant, which was shut down for two hours due to shelling, remained operational. Now, workers are rushing to repair the lines damaged by the shelling day and night. Employees of the waterworks resumed water supply on the second day after the battle ended. Students of Nankai University drove propaganda trucks on the afternoon of Tianjin's liberation, enthusiastically chanting, "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" The citizens were not afraid of the war. When the People's Liberation Army advanced, they gathered behind them, clapping and cheering. When the shelling stopped, they flocked to the streets, vying to talk to the People's Liberation Army with enthusiasm. The bulletin boards displaying the "Eight Rules of Conduct" of the Pingjin Front Command and the proclamations of the Tianjin Garrison Command and the Tianjin Military Control Commission were crowded with people reading them. The takeover work of the Military Control Commission is proceeding extremely smoothly. Personnel from the Nationalist Postal Administration, Tianjin Branch of the Ji'bei Electric Power Company, and the Tianjin Branch of the Nationalist Central News Agency, from top to bottom, remained at their posts, awaiting takeover. Due to the smooth takeover, Tianjin Radio began broadcasting at noon on the day the battle ended. The Tianjin Daily, a broadsheet, was also published on the 17th. The Tianjin Branch of Xinhua News Agency officially began sending out dispatches on the 16th.

　　天津顺利进行接收
  　工人冒着炮火保护工厂资材学生市民欢呼迎接我军入城
    【新华社天津十九日电】天津的工人、学生和市民们热情地接待着解放军。当战斗还在进行中，许多工人便冒着炮火保护他们的工厂和机器。中央机器厂的员工们组织了纠察队，轮流看守资材。公共汽车管理处的工人把全部卡车送入工场，以免损毁。冀北电力公司的三个发电厂，除第二厂因炮火停工两小时外，都一直开动着，现在工人们正日夜抢修被炮火损坏的线路。自来水厂的员工在战斗结束的第二日恢复了送水。南开大学的学生在天津解放的当日下午就开出了宣传卡车，热烈地欢呼着：“中国人民解放军万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”市民们对于战争并不惧怕。当解放军攻击前进时，他们就在后面群集拍掌欢呼。当炮火停止后，他们就涌到街上来，争着热情地和解放军谈话。张贴平津前线司令部的“约法八章”和天津卫戍司令部、天津区军事管制委员会布告的布告处面前挤满着阅读的人群。军事管制委员会的接管工作进行极为顺利。国民党邮政总局，冀北电力公司天津分公司，国民党中央社天津分社的人员从上到下都没有离开，等候着被接收。由于接收的顺利，天津广播电台在战斗结束的当日中午就开始了播音。对开的天津日报也在十七日出版。新华社天津分社则于十六日就开始正式发稿。
