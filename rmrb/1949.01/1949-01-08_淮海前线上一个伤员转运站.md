　　A Wounded Soldier Transfer Station
　　Around ten o'clock in the morning on November 28th, the first branch of the general transfer station, located close to the battlefield, received forty-eight wounded soldiers. The second shift on duty at the station, including doctors, nurses, and attendants, numbering thirty people, were busy feeding the wounded, changing dressings, and boiling water. The several wounded soldiers' rooms were very quiet, with only the low voices of the attendants comforting the wounded. Two enemy planes flew over, circling with loud noises in the low sky above the transfer station. The thirty comrades in the station calmly continued their work as usual. Only the deputy director was calling on everyone to conceal the equipment placed in the courtyard. Two bombs landed behind wounded soldier room number eight. An intern nurse, He Qingzhang, selflessly carried a wounded soldier out the door, and the house was knocked down by the bombs. Four wounded soldiers and seven staff members inside were immediately buried in the three rooms. More than a dozen comrades in the other houses, disregarding the enemy planes still circling and strafing overhead, rushed to rescue them. Gong Shusheng, Zhang Shoucheng, and Hou Yucheng, who had just climbed out from under the collapsed wall, led everyone in digging through the soil. The female attendant Fan Yun, who was buried under the wall, had just been pulled out when others told her to rest. She said, "No! As long as I'm not dead, I still want to take care of the wounded." Disregarding the pain in her foot, she immediately started digging. Hou Zhimei was knocked unconscious by the wall at the time, but after regaining consciousness, she ignored the pain and ran over to dig. The wounded comrades who were dug out also immediately started digging to rescue other comrades. They used their hands to dig without tools, and many comrades' hands were broken. The second shift rescued the comrades who had been bombed, while also caring for the wounded soldiers in the other rooms, continuing to deliver water and wash their faces, change bedding, and change bandages. They transferred the wounded to other stretchers and transported them to the rear, and cleaned the wounded soldiers' rooms, washed bloody clothes, and held a review meeting as usual.

　　淮海前线上
  　一个伤员转运站
    十一月二十八日上午十点钟左右，紧靠战场的转运总站一分站，接受了四十八名伤员。该站值班的第二班，包括医生、护士和看护员三十人，都忙碌着给伤员喂饭，换药，烧水，几个伤员室都很安静，只有看护员慰问伤员的低微的声音。两架敌机飞来了，轰隆地在转运站的低空盘旋着。站里三十位同志都照旧镇静地工作，只有副所长在招呼着将放在院里的器材隐蔽好。两颗炸弹落在第八号伤员室后边，实习护士何庆章奋不顾身地背着一个伤员刚出门，房子就被炸弹震倒了，室内四个伤员和七个工作人员立即被埋在三间房里。其他房子里十几个同志，不顾还在上空盘旋扫射的敌机，顿时奋勇跑来抢救。巩树生、张守增、侯玉成刚从倒塌的墙下爬起来，就带领大家奋力扒土。被压在墙下的女看护范云刚出土，别人叫她休息，她说：“不！只要我不死，还要救护伤员。”她不顾脚上的伤痛，立即动手扒土。侯志美当时被墙压晕了，清醒过来后就不顾疼痛跑过来扒土。被扒出的伤员同志也立即动手扒救其他同志。没有工具就用手扒，很多同志的手都扒破了。二班一面救护被炸的同志，同时又看护其他房里的伤员，继续给伤员送水洗脸，换被服，换绷带，将伤员另换担架，转运后方，照常打扫伤员室，洗血衣，开检讨会。
