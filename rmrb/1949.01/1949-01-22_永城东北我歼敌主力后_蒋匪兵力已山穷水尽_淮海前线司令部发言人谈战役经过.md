Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 20th: Our correspondent visited the spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Huaihai Front Headquarters today. He spoke about the great victory of the major annihilation battle in the northeast of Yongcheng, saying: "The approximately 300,000 Kuomintang troops surrounded by our army in the northeast of Yongcheng have been completely annihilated on the 10th! Top war criminal Du Yuming has been captured alive by our army. The third stage of the Huaihai Campaign has ended victoriously. Thus far, in the Xu州 battlefield, our army, after two months and five days of combat, has annihilated (including uprisings) all five Kuomintang army corps, most of one army corps, parts of two army corps, twenty-two entire armies, fifty-five entire divisions, and other troops, totaling approximately 600,000 men, winning a complete victory in the entire campaign." The spokesperson continued, "The enemy forces annihilated in the northeast of Yongcheng included the three army corps of Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang, ten armies, twenty-five divisions, and many special forces and irregular troops, totaling approximately 300,000 men. These enemy forces were commanded by Du Yuming, deputy commander-in-chief of the enemy's Xuzhou 'Suppression Headquarters,' and fled southwest from Xuzhou on December 1st of last year, and were completely surrounded by our army on December 4th. Among them, the two armies and four divisions of Sun Yuanliang's army corps, as well as the 44th Division, which was rebuilt after being completely annihilated by our army in Nianzhuang, were annihilated by our army in the second stage of the campaign. The two army corps of Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi, eight armies, twenty divisions, and all other troops, were thoroughly annihilated by our army in the third stage of the campaign." The spokesperson analyzed, "The great victory of the annihilation battle in the northeast of Yongcheng was achieved on the basis of the victories already won in the first and second stages of the campaign, and is the result of continuous combat and the large-scale annihilation of enemy manpower, especially the complete annihilation of the Huang Wei Army Corps, which was of decisive significance in ensuring the complete victory of this major annihilation battle. In the first stage of the campaign, at the time when the enemy forces were at their maximum, there were eight enemy army corps on the Xuzhou battlefield: Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, Huang Baitao, Huang Wei, Sun Yuanliang, Feng Zhi'an, Liu Ruming, and Li Yannian. By the end of the second stage of the campaign, after the Huang Wei Army Corps was completely annihilated, the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming army corps fled back to Bengbu, and then continued to flee south. The Xuzhou 'Suppression Headquarters' also moved from Bengbu to Chuxian, which completely isolated the Qiu and Li army corps and the remnants of the Sun Yuanliang Army Corps under the command of the bandit Du Yuming. From December 16th, our army rested for twenty days, using only a portion of its forces to besiege the enemy, and issued several exhortations and warnings to Du, Qiu, Li, and their subordinate army, division, and regimental commanders, ordering them to lay down their arms and surrender. Coincidentally, there were continuous days of rain and snow, the weather was bitterly cold, enemy airdrops were difficult, and many starved and froze to death. Under the powerful political offensive of our army, enemy troops surrendered one after another, and by January 5th, more than 10,000 enemy officers and soldiers had surrendered to us. At 3 p.m. on the 6th, our army continued to launch an offensive, and that night broke through the enemy's outer layer of strong positions. On the night of the 7th, we attacked and captured the internal positions of the Li Mi Army Corps. On the 8th, we continued to tighten the encirclement. On the night of the 9th, our army took advantage of the victory and continued to use resolute actions of fierce fighting, fierce charging, and fierce attacking to quickly penetrate the enemy's depths and its central positions, so that the enemy had no time to readjust its deployment. Large numbers of enemies were captured or fled for their lives, completely disrupting the enemy. At 2 p.m. on the 10th, we captured Chenzhuang, Huangzhuang, Chenguanzhuang, and dozens of strongholds where Du Yuming's headquarters and the Qiu and Li army corps headquarters were located. In fierce fighting until 10 a.m. on the 10th, our army destroyed the enemy's thousands upon thousands of bunkers, foxholes, and spiderweb-like trenches, and captured more than ninety villages and town strongholds. The entire enemy force was annihilated. The entire Huaihai Campaign was thus victoriously concluded."

　　永城东北我歼敌主力后
  　蒋匪兵力已山穷水尽
    淮海前线司令部发言人谈战役经过
    【新华社淮海前线廿日电】本社记者于日前往访人民解放军淮海前线司令部发言人，他对永城东北地区大歼灭战的巨大胜利发表谈话说：“被我军包围在永城东北的约三十万国民党军队，已经于十日被完全歼灭了！头号战争罪犯杜聿明已经被我军活捉。淮海战役第三阶段胜利结束。至此，我军在徐州战场上，经过两个月零五天的作战，共歼灭（包括起义）国民党五个兵团全部、一个兵团大部、两个兵团各一部、二十二个整军、五十五个整师以及其他部队共约六十万人，赢得了全战役的彻底胜利。”发言人接着说：“在永城东北地区被歼灭的敌军共有邱清泉、李弥、孙元良三个兵团、十个军、二十五个师以及许多特种部队和非正规军，共约卅万人。这些敌军系由敌徐州‘剿总’副总司令杜聿明所指挥，于去年十二月一日自徐州向西南逃窜，十二月四日被我军完全包围。其中孙元良兵团两个军、四个师及为我在碾庄全部歼灭而重建之四十四师，是在战役第二阶段中被我军歼灭的。邱清泉、李弥两个兵团，八个军，二十个师，及其他一切部队，则是在战役第三阶段中被我军彻底歼灭的。”发言人分析：“永城东北地区的歼灭战的大捷，是在战役第一、第二两阶段已得胜利的基础上获得的，是连续作战大量歼灭敌人有生力量的结果，特别是全歼了黄维兵团，对保证此次大歼灭战的全胜，更是有决定的意义。在战役第一阶段中，敌军最多时，徐州战场上的敌军曾有邱清泉、李弥、黄百韬、黄维、孙元良、冯治安、刘汝明、李延年等八个兵团。而到了战役第二阶段结束，黄维兵团被全歼以后，李延年、刘汝明两兵团逃回蚌埠，随后并继续南逃，徐州‘剿总’也从蚌埠搬到滁县，这样就使得被包围的杜聿明匪部邱、李两兵团和孙元良兵团残部完全孤立无援。自十二月十六日起，我军休息了二十天，仅用一部兵力围困敌军，并对杜、邱、李及所属军、师、团长发出数次劝告和警告，令其缴械投降。恰逢连日雨雪纷飞，天寒地冻，敌人空投不易，饿死冻死的很多。在我军强大政治攻势下，敌军纷纷投降，到一月五日为止，敌官兵向我投降者即达万余人。六日下午三时，我军继续发动攻势，当夜即突破敌人外层坚强阵地，七日夜间攻估李弥兵团内部阵地。八日继续紧缩包围圈。九日夜间，我军乘胜继续以坚决的猛打、猛冲、猛攻的动作，迅速插入敌人纵深及其中心阵地，使敌人来不及从新调整部署，大批敌人被俘的被俘，逃命的逃命，把敌人完全打乱。十日下午二时，打下杜聿明指挥所与邱、李两兵团司令部所在地的陈庄、黄庄、陈官庄及数十个据点。激战到十日上午十时，我军摧毁了敌人成千成万的地堡、散兵坑及蛛网式的壕沟，攻克九十多个村镇据点。敌人全部被歼灭了。全淮海战役遂告胜利结束。”
