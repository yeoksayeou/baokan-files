　　North Yue Women's Federation Issues
  　Inspection and Opinions on Marriage Policy
    [Report from this newspaper] The North Yue District Women's Federation recently issued an "Instruction on the Inspection of Current Marriage Policy and Future Opinions." It pointed out that there are serious shortcomings in the current implementation of the marriage policy: for example, early marriage is quite common in some old and semi-old areas. In five villages in the fourth district of Xingtang, there have been 64 early marriages in recent months. There has also been an increase in arranged marriages. In Changbei Village, the third district of Wanxian, all five marriages this year were disguised arranged marriages in which the man spent grain, cloth, and other costs. There are also many cases of abused women. Some district cadres believe that the policy has changed and are afraid to interfere. Some couples' relationships have deteriorated to the point where they cannot live together, but they are not given a reasonable solution; in some places, women who file for divorce are even detained. Because these problems have not been properly handled, as many as 50 women have committed suicide in the first, third, fourth, and fifth districts in recent months, 40 of which were due to dissatisfaction with marriage and unbearable domestic abuse. The instruction pointed out the following reasons for this situation when reviewing the formation of this situation: (1) Right-leaning thought and tailism in marriage policy are to blame. Leaders at all levels have long been in a state of laissez-faire in implementing the marriage policy; they have not conducted in-depth education on the marriage policy for cadres and the masses. Originally, some couples' relationships were extremely deteriorated and difficult to continue living together. However, some leading organs catered to feudal ideas, believing that the masses would not sympathize with the approval of divorce. They even prevented women from divorcing, resulting in bad consequences. (2) Many cadres have serious feudal and backward ideas of valuing men over women, resisting the implementation of the marriage policy, and even believing that women's request for divorce is undesirable regardless of the specific conditions. Therefore, the phenomenon of cadres arranging and interfering in marriage and divorce freedom has occurred. Li Jinhua of Fengjiawan, the second district of Lingshou (married through arranged marriage), was beaten and bullied all day long. When she went to the district to ask for a divorce, not only was it not resolved, but the woman was detained. Similar problems are common in other places. They are only afraid that poor male peasants will lose their wives and are not allowed to divorce, while ignoring the suffering of poor women. In addition, not enough marriage policy is instilled in new cadres. (3) Bureaucracy on the part of the leadership has led to as many as 50 cases of suicide among women. Laiyuan County is afraid of solving problems and not being able to control them, so it does not dare to solve them boldly. Regarding how to correctly implement the marriage policy in the future, the instruction put forward the following points: (1) First of all, cadres' thinking should be straightened out so that they recognize that implementing the marriage policy is not simply a women's issue, but a complex social transformation issue. All male and female cadres must pay attention to it. After the peasants obtained land in the land reform, the autonomy and freedom of marriage have become an urgent requirement for young men and women. Therefore, the correct implementation of the marriage policy has a very important role in promoting family democracy, harmony, and production for the masses. The leadership should let go and boldly solve problems, but at the same time, they should handle them with a cautious and responsible attitude towards the masses, preventing rashness, casualness, and detachment from the masses; however, on the other hand, they should also overcome the tendency of tailism. (2) Conduct in-depth publicity and education on the marriage policy to the masses. Gradually let the masses consciously master the policy. After the Laiyuan County Party Committee conveyed the spirit of the marriage policy in a training class of 800 people, many village cadres returned to the village and held family meetings to resolve family discord. The secretary of the West Guan branch used to beat his wife often. After returning from training, he apologized to his wife and discussed how to live a good life. Four women in Nanguan went to the Women's Federation to apply for party membership. They said, "After the village cadres returned and held family meetings for us, we are no longer abused at home. We are willing to join the party. We can attend meetings often and hear more about the policies of the higher authorities." (3) Overcome bureaucracy and care about the immediate suffering of the vast number of women. Regarding the current suicide cases, we should cooperate with the judicial section to first find and solve cases that have a major impact, in order to educate cadres and peasants to go deeper into the masses in the future, actively discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner.

### 北岳妇联会发出　关于婚姻政策的检查与意见

　　北岳妇联会发出
  　关于婚姻政策的检查与意见
    【本报讯】北岳区妇联会最近发出“关于目前婚姻政策的检查与今后意见”的指示。指出：目前贯彻婚姻政策中存在着严重的缺点：如有些老区半老区中，早婚现象相当普遍，行唐四区五个村，近数月来即有六十四个早婚的。买卖婚姻也有增加。完县三区常北庄今年五个结婚的，都是男方花费粮食、布匹等代价的变相买卖婚姻。妇女受虐待的也不少。有些区干部认为政策变了，不敢管。有的夫妇关系已恶化到不能同居的程度，但仍不给以合理解决；甚至有的地方对提出离婚的女方，反而加以扣押。因为这些问题未能恰当处理，故一、三、四、五四个分区数月来，妇女发生自杀的案件达五十起之多，其中对婚姻不满，不堪家庭虐待等自杀的即达四十件。该指示于检讨形成这种情形的原因时指出：（一）是婚姻政策上的右倾思想与尾巴主义作怪。各级领导对贯彻婚姻政策，长期陷于自流状态；对干部、群众没有深入进行婚姻政策的教育。本来有些夫妇关系极端恶化，势难继续同居。但某些领导机关迁就封建思想，认为批准离婚群众会不同情。甚至阻止妇女离婚，以致招致恶果。（二）不少干部存在着严重的重男轻女的封建落后思想，抵抗婚姻政策的执行，甚至不看具体条件，把妇女请求离婚，认为是要不得的。所以发生干部包办、干涉结婚、离婚自由的现象。灵寿二区封家湾李金花（买卖婚姻结合的），整天挨打受气，到区请求离婚，不但不解决，反把女方押起来。其他地方类似问题也很多。只怕男贫苦农民没了老婆，不准离婚，而忽视了贫苦妇女的痛苦。此外，对新干部灌输婚姻政策也很不够。（三）领导上官僚主义，致使各地妇女自杀案件竟发展到五十件之多。涞源县是怕解决开了，掌握不住，因而不敢大胆解决。关于今后怎样正确贯彻婚姻政策，指示中提出下列数点：（一）首先应搞通干部思想，使干部认识贯彻婚姻政策，不单纯是妇女问题，而且是一个复杂的社会改造问题。全体男女干部均必须重视。土地改革中农民获得土地后，婚姻的自主自由，已成为青年男女迫切的要求。因之，正确执行婚姻政策，对促进群众家庭民主和睦与生产发家上，作用甚为重大。领导上应该放手大胆的解决问题，但同时要以慎重和对群众负责的态度处理，防止轻率、随便和脱离群众；可是，另一方面，也应克服尾巴主义的偏向。（二）向群众进行深入的婚姻政策的宣传教育。逐渐让群众自觉的掌握政策。涞源县委在八百个人的训练班中，传达了婚姻政策的精神后，很多村干部回村开了家庭会议，解决了家庭的不和。西关支部书记过去常打老婆，受训回去向老婆赔了不是，商量怎样过光景。南关有四个妇女找妇联会要求入党，她们说：“村干部回来给我们开了家庭会议后，家里不虐待我们了，我们愿意入党，常开会，更能听到上级的政策”。（三）克服官僚主义，关心广大妇女切身痛苦。对目前发生的自杀案件，要协同司法科，先找影响大的案件解决，以此教育干部与农民今后更应深入群众，主动发现问题，及时加以解决。
