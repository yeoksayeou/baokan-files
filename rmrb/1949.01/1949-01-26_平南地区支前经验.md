Experiences in Supporting the Front Lines in the Pingnan Area
    Li Fu
    In the new districts of Pingnan, Daxing, Zhuoliangwan (newly established county, parts of Zhuoxian, Liangxiang, and Wanping), and Gu'an, the masses victoriously completed the arduous task of supporting the front lines after the start of the Pingjin Campaign. The following experiences were gained in leading the work of supporting the front lines:
    (1) Deeply mobilize for war to create a surge in support for the front lines.
    Before the opening of the Pingjin Campaign, mobilization was carried out among all cadres, calling on them to carry forward the spirit of hard work and resolutely complete the great task of supporting the liberation of Pingjin. Mass meetings were also held in various villages to carry out propaganda and education work for supporting the front lines. Therefore, after the start of the campaign, cadres were able to work day and night, forgetting sleep and meals. The masses also took active action, actively grinding flour, pushing rice, repairing roads, and building bridges. When Lianggezhuang in Gu'an built the Beicai Bridge, the masses worked day and night, going into the icy river to drive piles, and many models emerged. The two large bridges, each 121 zhang long, were completed in just nine days, ensuring smooth transportation.
    (2) Establish a unified wartime logistics organization to concentrate forces.
    The county and districts established a unified logistics headquarters, composed of party, government, military, and civilian cadres, with the county head serving as director, the county party secretary as political commissar, and the armed forces minister as deputy director. It was divided into mobilization, supply, and organization and propaganda sections to carry out work under the unified leadership of the Party. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient cadres, Gu'an established core groups in each district to lead the work of supporting the front lines in the whole district, and also established several sub-districts in the whole district. The core group and the sub-district should have a mobile force (village cadres, militia, activists) to ensure close contact between superiors and subordinates and rapid completion of tasks. The county head of Zhuoliangwan used the method of issuing letters of engagement to invite people to weigh, keep accounts, and cook, completing the task of storing millions of catties of grain.
    (3) Strengthen wartime economic management and stabilize prices.
    After the liberation of the Pingnan area, market transactions were once chaotic due to the lack of unified currency. According to the transaction statistics of the Gu'an market on December 23 last year, barter trade accounted for 60%, puppet currency accounted for 25%, and local currency accounted for 15%, which once led to rising prices.
    Various stores and economic and trade departments, in conjunction with the local government, quickly organized a unified wartime economic organization, and established branches in Baxian, Niutuo, Gu'an, Lixian, Caiyu, and Langfang. According to the local economic situation, combined with the front-line non-staple food station, they established outlets, posted advertisements, announced prices, and sold major materials such as grain, oil, and salt. At the same time, the bank publicized the monetary policy, calculated all prices in local currency, clarified the statutory exchange rate, and stopped the circulation of puppet gold yuan coupons. The market quickly stabilized, and confidence in the local currency rapidly increased. By January 3, the price of corn had fallen from 160 yuan to 90 yuan.

　　平南地区支前经验
    力夫
    平南大兴、涿良宛（新设县，涿县、良乡、宛平各一部）、固安等新区群众，在平津战役开始后，胜利的完成了繁重的支援前线任务，在领导支援前线工作上，获得如下经验：
    （一）深入进行战争动员造成支前热潮。
    平津战役揭幕前，即在全体干部中进行了动员，号召发扬艰苦作风，坚决完成支援解放平津的伟大任务。各村也召开了群众大会，进行了支前的宣传鼓动和教育工作。因之在战役开始后干部都能日以继夜、废寝忘食的坚持工作。群众也积极行动起来，积极磨面推米修路架桥。固安梁各庄，北菜架桥时，群众昼夜加工，在冰河里下水打桩，涌现了不少的模范。长达一百二十一丈的两座大桥，仅用了九天的时间即告竣工，保证了运输的畅通。
    （二）建立统一的战时后勤机构，集中使用力量。
    县区建立了统一的后勤指挥部，由党政军民干部组成，县长任主任，县委书记任政委，武装部长任副主任，下分动员、供给、组织宣传三科，在党的统一领导下进行工作。为解决干部不足困难，固安各区设立了核心组，领导全区的支前工作，另外在全区设立若干小区。核心组、小区要掌握一部机动力量（村干部、民兵、积极分子），作到上下级联系密切，完成任务迅速。涿良宛县长用下聘请书的办法，请来了过秤的、写帐的、做饭的各人员，完成了数百万斤粮食入库的任务。
    （三）加强战地经济管理，稳定物价。
    平南地区解放后，因币制不统一，市场交易曾一度混乱，据去年十二月二十三日固安集市的交易统计，以物易物占百分之六十，伪币占百分之二十五，本币占百分之十五，物价因之一度上涨。
    各商店和经济贸易部门，结合当地政府，迅速组织了统一的战时经济组织，并于霸县、牛驼、固安、礼贤、采育、廊房设立了分店，根据当地经济情况，结合支前副食站，设立了门市部，张贴广告，公布价格，进行粮食及油盐等主要物资的抛售。同时银行宣传了货币政策，一律以本币计算，明确了法定比值，停止伪金圆券的流通，市场迅速稳定，本币信仰迅速提高。至一月三日，玉米由以前的一百六十元落到九十元。
