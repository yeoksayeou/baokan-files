　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: TASS, Rome: The leadership of the Italian Socialist Party published a reply on January 21st in the party's newspaper, Avanti!, to the ultimatum issued by the Executive Committee of the Socialist International Congress. The ultimatum demanded that the Italian Socialist Party cease its joint actions with the Italian Communist Party. The reply sternly criticized the policies pursued by the Labour Party and other right-wing social democrats in the Executive Committee of the Socialist International. The reply emphasized that the letter from the Executive Committee of the Socialist International, signed by Phillips (referring to the secretary of the British Labour Party), ignored the "grave danger of the revival of the Church-Conservative order in Italy." On the contrary, the Executive Committee of the Socialist International "paid special attention to the fact of joint action." According to this organization's opinion, "the task before the Socialist Party is to participate in the anti-communist front." The reply stated that this proves that the degradation of the so-called "Third Force" has reached its extreme. The union of the "Third Force," appearing in Europe as a united front of social democrats and Catholics, with opposition to communism as its main purpose, has gradually degenerated into a group in which Catholicism plays a leading role, while social democrats have to be satisfied with their status as pawns and followers. In foreign policy, this process is adapted to the cohesion of "Western" countries around the hegemonic United States. The United States constitutes the basis of the conservative group with Catholicism and capitalism as its soul. The reply further pointed out that the West European Socialist Party is pursuing a policy of constantly deviating from the main requirements of socialist internationalism. The reply vehemently criticized the British Labour Party's colonial oppression policies in Asia and Africa: the support for Transjordan, the control of Sudan to indirectly control Egypt, the anti-communist and anti-union policies pursued in Asia and Africa, the suppression in Rhodesia, the Gold Coast and Kenya, the policies pursued in Malaya, and other similar facts – all of these indicate that the Labour Party is continuing the Conservative Party's imperialist policies. The reply emphasized that the French Socialist Party should be held responsible for the massacre of 80,000 residents of Madagascar, the suppression in Vietnam, and other crimes. The reply condemned the Dutch Drees social democratic government for engaging in a war of aggression in Indonesia, which involved a series of massacres, mass arrests, imprisonments, and bombings. The main purpose of the West German Social Democratic Party is to oppose the Soviet Union, and they even use Nazi underground organizations for this purpose. The reply concluded: "Under these circumstances, the Italian Socialist Party will continue to be loyal to the interests of the working class."

　　意社会党严斥国际社会党
  　拒绝停止与意共联盟的反动要求
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利社会党领导机关，于一月二十一日在该党机关报前进报上发表对国际社会党大会执委会所提的最后通牒的复文，该通牒要求意大利社会党停止与意大利共产党的联合行动。该复文对工党和国际社会党执委会中其他右翼社会民主党所奉行的政策，予以严厉斥责。复文力称：由菲利浦（按系英国工党书记）署名的国际社会党执委会的信件，无视“教会——保守主义的秩序在意大利复活的重大危险”，相反地，国际社会党执委会却“专门注意联合行动的事实”。按照这一机构的意见，“摆在社会党面前的任务，是参加反共阵线”。复文说：这证明所谓“第三种力量”的堕落已达于极点。作为社会民主党和天主教分子的联合阵线而在欧洲出现，并以反对共产主义为其主要目的的“第三种力量”的联合，已经逐渐堕落成为这样一种集团，其中，天主教起领导作用，而社会民主党不得不满意于他们自己充当走卒和追随者的地位。在外交政策方面，这一过程与“西方”国家之纠合在霸主——美国周围一事相适应。美国是构成以天主教主义、资本主义为其灵魂的保守集团的基础。复文进一步指出：西欧社会党奉行着不断背离社会主义的国际主义主要要求的政策。复文猛烈抨击英国工党在亚洲和非洲所奉行的殖民的压迫政策：对外约旦的支持，控制苏丹以间接控制埃及，在亚洲和非洲奉行的反共与反职工会的政策，在罗得西亚、黄金海岸和怯尼亚的镇压，在马来亚所奉行的政策以及其他类似的事实——这一切都表明：工党正继续着保守党的帝国主义政策。复文着重指出：法国社会党应对马达加斯加八万居民的大屠杀及在越南的镇压和其他罪行负责。复文谴责荷兰德里斯的社会民主党政府正在印尼从事的侵略战争，这一战争进行了一连串的大屠杀、大逮捕、监禁与轰炸。西德社会民主党的主要目的，就是反对苏联，他们甚至因此目的而利用纳粹的地下组织。复文结语宣称：“在这种形势之下，意大利社会党将继续忠实于工人阶级的利益”。
