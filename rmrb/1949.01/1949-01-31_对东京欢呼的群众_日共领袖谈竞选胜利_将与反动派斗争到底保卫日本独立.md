　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Tokyo dispatch: After the news of the Japanese Communist Party's great victory in the parliamentary elections spread, Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, told thousands of cheering masses in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 24th: "We will fight against the reactionaries who are selling Japan to foreign countries." Tokuda called on the enthusiastically applauding audience to support the Japanese Communist Party and establish a democratic Japan so as to gain friendly cooperation with the Communist-led democratic China. On the afternoon of the 25th, Tokuda held a grand press conference in Tokyo, which was attended by a large number of reporters. Tokuda told reporters that although the Japanese Communist Party has won at least 35 seats in the House of Representatives, this only represents one-third of its true strength. He condemned Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party as a "war criminal party" who are selling Japan to foreign countries. Tokuda declared that the Japanese Communist Party will fight the reactionaries to the end in order to defend Japan's independence. Tokuda called on the Labor-Farmer Party and the Socialist Party to cooperate closely with the Japanese Communist Party to oppose mass layoffs of workers and harmful anti-labor laws, oppose heavy taxes, government-set rice prices that damage farmers' interests, and political corruption.
　　Another leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Nosaka Sanzo, also delivered a speech to 20,000 people in the center of Tokyo on the afternoon of the 24th, pointing out that the large increase in the number of seats held by the Japanese Communist Party in the House of Representatives shows that the Japanese people have now further realized that the Japanese Communist Party is a party fighting for the happiness of the people.

    【新华社陕北二十八日电】东京讯：当日本共产党在议会选举中获得巨大胜利的消息传出以后，日共总书记德田球一于二十四日下午告东京数千欢呼的群众称：“我们将对那些把日本出卖给外国的反动派进行斗争。”德田向热烈鼓掌的听众发出号召，要他们拥护日本共产党，建立民主化的日本，以便能与共产党领导的民主的中国，获得友谊合作。二十五日下午，德田又在东京举行盛大的招待记者会，到会的记者极为踊跃。德田告记者称：日本共产党虽已在众院中至少获得三十五席，但此仅足表示其真实力量的三分之一。他谴责吉田的民主自由党是“战犯党”，他们将日本出卖给外国。德田宣称：日共将与反动派斗争到底，以保卫日本的独立。德田号召工农党与社会党和日共密切合作，以反对大批解雇工人和有害的反劳工法，反对苛重的捐税，官定的损害农民利益的、太低的米价及政治上的腐败。
    日共另一领袖野坂参三，亦于二十四日下午在东京市中心区向二万群众发表演说，指出日共在众院议席的大增，表明日本人民现已更进一步地认识日本共产党是为人民幸福而奋斗的政党。
