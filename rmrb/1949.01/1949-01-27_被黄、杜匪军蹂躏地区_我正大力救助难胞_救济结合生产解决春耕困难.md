Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 25th -- The democratic government and the People's Liberation Army are urgently providing 15 million catties of grain to aid the disaster-stricken people in the southwest of Xuzhou who suffered from the devastation of Chiang's bandits, saving them from starvation and helping to rebuild their destroyed homes. This area belongs to the Third Sub-district of the Yu-Wan-Su Liberated Area. In order to carry out the relief work quickly and effectively, the leading organs of the Party, government, and army of the sub-district jointly organized a Post-War Rehabilitation Committee and established sub-committees in the north and south disaster areas, respectively, according to the areas of Su (County), Meng (City), and Huai (Yuan) that were ravaged by the Huang Wei bandit army and the areas of Xiao (County), Su (County), and Xue (Feng) that were ravaged by the Du Yuming bandit army. The Yu-Wan-Su Administrative Office has decided to adopt the method of combining relief with production, and has allocated 15 million catties of relief grain. Apart from using a portion for emergency relief, the majority is used to organize the disaster-stricken people to engage in textile, transportation, and river digging (work-for-relief) and to solve the difficulties of spring plowing seeds, livestock, and agricultural tools. At the same time, it mobilized the local people to carry out mutual assistance and mutual relief. The Su-Meng-Huai Post-War Rehabilitation Committee of the Southern War Zone, immediately after the Huang bandits were annihilated, set up work stations in more than 40 villages, including Shuangduiji, which suffered the most from the bandits' harm. Hundreds of staff members carried, carried, and transported large amounts of grain and firewood to the refugees in the freezing weather. According to statistics for only ten days, more than 190,000 catties of emergency relief flour have been distributed, and more than 7,300 refugees have been saved from starvation. On the second day after the end of the battle in the northern war zone, the Xuefeng County government distributed 12 catties of white flour to each of the thousands of homeless refugees in Chen Guanzhuang and other places. The villages that suffered the most from the bandits were given 50 catties of grain per person. For the general refugees, after self-reporting and public discussion, anyone over the age of three was given one and a half catties of sorghum flour per person per day, and 120,000 catties were distributed in seven days. The Xiao County government also allocated 200,000 catties of relief grain and set up refugee reception centers. Party, government, and military personnel in Xue (Feng) and Wo (Yang) counties saved more than 3,000 catties of grain from their own meals to help the refugees. At the same time, the people in the areas near the disaster area were mobilized to make disaster relief donations based on the principle of voluntary participation. A certain division of the People's Liberation Army changed their daily two meals of rice and one meal of porridge to two meals of porridge and one meal of rice, saving three taels of rice per person per day, which was cooked and sent to the refugees. All companies in a certain division responded in unison to the call to change their daily diet to two meals of porridge and one meal of rice, and donated their allowances and clothing to the refugees. The People's Liberation Army also helped the refugees rebuild their houses. Some even set up specialized medical teams to treat the sick and wounded refugees. In carrying out these relief efforts, staff at all levels demonstrated a high degree of responsibility to serve the people. Shou Songtao, secretary of the CCP Prefectural Committee of the sub-district, and Commissioner Xu Xilian personally presided over the Post-War Relief Committee. Deputy Commissioner Li Shizhuang personally went to various places to supervise and inspect the relief work and to comfort the refugees. Pan Chengjie, the district chief of Su Nan District in Su (County) and Meng (City) counties, personally drove a large cart back and forth to transport more than 7,000 catties of flour and a large amount of firewood. Comrade Han Xinde of the district braved the snowflakes and the north wind to register and comfort the victims, so that the refugees in several villages quickly got warm and full. These refugees, who had been thrown into hell on earth by the Kuomintang bandit army, were deeply moved and thanked repeatedly when they received the enthusiastic help and brotherly condolences from the people's government and the people's army.
