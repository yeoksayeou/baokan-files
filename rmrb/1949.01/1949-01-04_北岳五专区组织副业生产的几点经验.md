Beiyue Fifth Special District
Several Experiences of Organizing Sideline Production

The Beiyue Fifth Special District has gained some experiences and lessons in organizing sideline production. The following is a summary for reference by various regions.

(1) It is necessary to grasp the principle of small profits and quick turnover and organize the masses for more production, breaking the idea of high profits among the masses. In terms of understanding, it must first be understood that sideline production is carried out using the surplus labor of farmers during the slack season and is different from independently operated production undertakings. Its profits cannot be calculated according to regular work or other daily labor. The refugee women in the Fourth District of Xushui initially disliked the small profit from spinning thread, but had no other production. After the leadership calculated the detailed account with them, they could still support themselves. Then, they organized five groups of eighteen people. In twelve days, they spun fifty-four catties of thread, earning thirty-three catties and four taels of cotton, and one hundred and sixty catties of corn, totaling four hundred and sixty catties of corn, which could sustain their eighteen people for seventeen days. In the spring of Tang County, when supporting poor villages with agricultural loans to engage in transportation and sales, they were afraid that the masses would suffer losses if they borrowed grain to eat, so they sold the grain and bought cloth, converting it into loans. Some borrowed the cloth and stored it, waiting specifically to "profit from the market," and when the cloth price rose, they transported it to the brick road for sale. In this way, they made a lot of money, but they took advantage of the public and did not benefit the development of production at all.

(2) It is necessary to develop various sidelines according to specific conditions such as raw materials, technology, sales channels, and the habits of the masses, overcoming blindness. According to the district's experience, women in general mountainous areas have good shoe-making skills and have a habit of making shoes; however, the sales are not large, so it has not been developed on a large scale. Therefore, we should focus on solving the sales problem, purchasing through the business of promoting societies, and supporting the development of private shoe shops in a planned way, driving women to sew soles, sew shoe mouths, and twist shoe ropes. Laiyuan County did this, and in addition to handing in military shoes, the masses earned more than 60,000 catties of rice. In addition, there are more than a hundred kinds of medicinal materials in the mountains, which were sold to various places before the war, but later they were abandoned on the ground due to enemy blockade. Therefore, we should vigorously mobilize the masses to dig them up and open up sales channels; promoting societies should establish business relationships with stores and pharmaceutical factories, and support medicine merchants and peddlers to purchase medicinal materials anytime and anywhere. This year, Laiyuan Promoting Society and Jimin Pharmaceutical Factory established a relationship, and both parties collected medicine separately, facilitating the sales of the masses. The number of people in the village of Queerlin, with more than a hundred households, who dug medicinal materials reached eighty-four. Tang County Promoting Society’s first and second offices, through the business of collecting medicines, enabled households in mountainous areas to profit from medicinal materials worth more than 100,000 catties of rice. The plains have a foundation for weaving; many machines are still stopped due to the poor sales of native cloth. Stores and promoting societies should vigorously help to rectify villages to adapt to opening up sales channels. Yi County and Yifenghou Store, based on this principle, conducted village rectification in four villages, including Beitaiyu, this spring, making the cloth of the village sell well and earn money. However, Wan County, in the village rectification of native cloth, mechanically improved the quality and wove fine cloth (Double Deer cloth) without properly estimating the sales problem, resulting in poor sales and many machines unable to move.

(3) It is necessary to rectify and develop the supply and marketing business of cooperatives to drive, support, and consolidate the sideline production of the masses. After the willow weaving households in Beichangfeng, Wan County, formed a unified supply and marketing "labor production cooperative," the willow weaving industry has been newly developed. In Shuikou Village, Tenth District of Yi County, there was no foundation for mutual assistance and cooperation in the past; cadres subjectively organized two carpenters, two apprentices, and ten farmers into an agricultural and sideline labor-allocation carpentry cooperative, and even more wrongly stipulated a dividend and work-sharing method in which farmers benefited and carpenters suffered losses. As a result, before the organization, one of the carpenters could make a loom in five days, and sometimes the women in the family could help, making the work faster; after "organizing cooperation," it took six days to make one, and the women in the family were also idle. Therefore, this "cooperative" quickly collapsed.

(4) It is necessary to expand the labor force and fully mobilize semi-able-bodied laborers to engage in sideline production, especially to give play to the skills of women; but we must pay attention to adjusting the contradiction between women's individual production and family production in the spirit of "giving consideration to both public and private interests." In the plain area of Tang County, the income from women's spinning and weaving generally belongs to the individual; but the cloth for her and her husband's and children's clothing is no longer supplied by the family. This habit is beneficial to promoting and consolidating the enthusiasm of women in participating in sideline production. (Editor's note: Whether the income from women's sideline production can be appropriately split into several parts for public use according to the specific circumstances of the family, such as whether life is difficult, how many sisters-in-law there are? ... Various places can experiment.) In Lichengjian and other two villages in the Seventh District of the county, 80% of the women are engaged in sideline production. In some areas of Xushui, the women's spinning and weaving business has not been developed as it should be because this issue has not been properly resolved.

### 北岳五专区组织副业生产的几点经验

　　北岳五专区
  　组织副业生产的几点经验
    北岳五专区在组织副业生产中得到一些经验教训。现摘要写出，供各地参考。
    （一）要掌握薄利多销、组织群众多生产的原则，打破群众中的厚利思想。在认识上，首先要了解到副业生产是利用农民的剩余劳力在农闲中进行的，和单独经营的生产事业不同，其利润不能按正业或其他日工活来计算。徐水四区的难民妇女，起初嫌纺线利小，可又没有别的生产。经领导上同她们算细帐，结果还能自己养活自己。接着，她们组织起五组十八人，十二天中纺线五十四斤，赚棉花三十三斤四两，玉茭一百六十斤，共合玉茭四百六十斤，能维持她们十八人十七天的生活。唐县春天以农贷扶持穷村搞运销时，怕群众贷粮吃亏，便粜粮购成布，折款贷出；有的便贷了布存着专等“赚行市”，等布价涨了，又运到砖路出卖，这样钱是赚了很多；但是讨了公家的便宜，对发展生产毫无益处。
    （二）要按照原料、技术、销路、群众习惯等具体条件，要发展各种副业，克服盲目性。据该区经验：一般山地妇女做鞋技术好，且有做鞋习惯；但销路不大，未能大量发展，所以，就应着重解决销路，通过推进社的业务来收买，有计划地扶助发展私人鞋铺，带动妇女纳鞋底、缝鞋口、搓鞋绳等。涞源县这样做了，群众除交军鞋外，还赚米六万多斤。另如山地药材不下百余种，抗战前远销各地，后因敌人封锁，货弃于地。所以应大力发动群众刨掘，打开销路；推进社应和商店药厂建立业务关系，并扶助药商小贩，随时随地收买药材，今年涞源推进社与济民药厂订立关系，双方分头收药，便利群众销售，刨药村的人大大增加。雀儿林百余户的村，就有八十四户刨药材的。唐县推进社一、二办事处，通过收药业务，使山地的刨药材户获利米十万余斤。平原有纺织基础；多因土布销路不畅，不少机子还停着。商店和推进社应用大力帮助整庄，适应打开销路。易县和益丰厚商店，本此原则，今春在北台鱼等四村进行整庄，使该村布又好卖，又赚钱。而完县在土布整庄中，机械地提高质量织细布（双鹿布），没恰当估计销路问题，结果不好卖，好多机子动不起来。
    （三）要整顿和发展合作社的供销业务，来带动、支持与巩固群众的副业生产。完县北常丰的柳编户，组成统一供销的“劳动生产社”后，柳编业得到新的发展。易县十区水口村，过去没互助合作基础；干部主观地把两个木匠、两个学徒、十户农民，组织起农、副业拨工性的木厂合作社，更错误地规定农户沾光、木匠吃亏的分红、齐工办法。其结果：未组织前，其中有个木匠，五天能打一张机子，有时家里的妇女还能打下手，出活就更快；“组织合作”后，六天才打一张，家里妇女也闲着，因此这个“社”很快就垮台了。
    （四）要扩大劳动面，充分发动半劳力从事副业生产，特别要发挥妇女的本事；但必须注意按“公私兼顾”的精神，调整妇女个人生产与家庭生产的矛盾。唐县平原区，妇女纺织所得，一般归个人所有；但她和她丈夫、小孩的穿布，家里不再供给。这种习惯，对促进与巩固妇女参加副业生产的积极性，是有好处的。（编者按：妇女的副业生产所得，是否可根据家庭的具体情形，如生活困难与否，妯娌多少？………适当地劈出若干成归公伙。各地可以试验。）该县七区李成涧等两村，有百分之八十的妇女投入副业生产。徐水有的地区，则因没适当解决这一问题，妇纺事业也就没得到应有的开展。
