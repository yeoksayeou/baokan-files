　　Yangcheng Niuxin ＠ Livestock Survey
　　Niuxin ＠ is a small village under the jurisdiction of Matai Village in the Sixth District of Yangcheng, Taiyue. It is located on the north side of Xicheng ＠, a shady area with a very cold climate, making crops susceptible to frost. However, the grass on the mountains grows abundantly, and water is not scarce. It is said that there are more than two hundred kinds of medicinal seedlings. Cattle, mules, donkeys, and horses that eat this grass can get rid of diseases and become fat and strong in just a few days. Because of these conditions, in addition to farming, the farmers of Niuxin ＠ take raising livestock as their main sideline. A long time ago, there were only a dozen households in this village, raising forty to fifty livestock. In 1930, it increased to twenty-six households, with more than two hundred cattle, twenty to thirty donkeys, and more than four hundred sheep. Each year, more than thirty calves and donkey foals were added. Every year, old, small, and poorly built animals were sold outside, with each household selling an average of one animal. Since 1930, when Sun Dianying's troops robbed thirteen female donkeys and one bull, the number of donkeys has greatly decreased. During the Anti-Japanese War, after the "December Incident," the Chiang and Yan bandit troops robbed donkeys and slaughtered sheep year after year, resulting in losses and waste. Everyone lost the will to raise them. After liberation in 1942, the democratic government advocated for the development of production, and the livestock here slowly began to recover. Now there are a total of thirty-seven households, with seventy-one cattle, two donkeys, and more than one hundred sheep. Seventeen calves were born the year before last, and thirteen calves were born last year. Zhang Xiaomen's cow gave birth to a female calf in the first month of the year before last, and then a male calf in December, and another one last year. Zhang Wuxuan's old cow gave birth to one calf every year for eleven consecutive years. Compared with before the War of Resistance, although it is still far behind, the reproduction of livestock is still not slow. Here, because raising livestock has always been regarded as the main sideline, there is a lot of experience in feeding and caring for livestock: First, in the usual feeding and management, they say: "Cattle are 'fire animals' and cannot be exposed to heat." In summer, cattle are kept in the wild. In winter, cattle cannot be exposed to cold, as they will get sick. In winter, the pens should be kept warm. "One warmth equals three points of strength." Straw curtains are hung on the doors of each cattle pen, rolled up in the morning and lowered in the evening, which can both circulate air and preserve warmth. In winter, mature cows should drink boiled sesame oil two or three times, which can warm the stomach and eliminate intestinal heat. It is not good to let cattle drink cold water in the morning or rice water in the evening, because the cattle will lie down at night, and it is not good to keep the water in their stomachs. It is best to drink water at noon, after which the cattle are still moving, so they can eat more grass. Feeding cattle some material soup in winter and spring, and feeding them salt two or three times in summer, can make them willing to eat, maintain their condition, and strengthen their muscles and bones. Second, regarding the timing of livestock breeding, their experience is: "It is best to breed cattle in June, July, and August; it is best to breed donkeys in February, March, and April," because cows gestate for nine months and donkeys gestate for one year. If they give birth to calves and foals in the spring, the climate is mild, and the pasture is fertile, so the cows and donkeys will not lose weight, and the calves and foals will be easy to raise. Summer is hot, and winter is cold, making it difficult to raise calves and foals, and the cows and donkeys will also be strained. Third, regarding the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases, they always ask veterinarian Mr. Li from Hujia Village to come and check a few times each year, giving injections where needed, letting blood where needed, and giving medicine where needed, so that the livestock will suffer less from diseases. If one dies occasionally from illness, it is buried underground with its skin, and the manure in the pen of the sick livestock is completely removed, and the pen is also burned with fire. Even if cattle plague occurs, it can be quickly extinguished. However, they also have a point that they do not pay attention to in breeding, because they often allow bulls and cows to mate randomly in large groups, without good selection of breeds. Although many calves are born, they are not very big. People in Yangbai Village laugh at their cattle herds, saying: "Several can be covered with a bamboo basket," but they say: "The milk of the cows is good, and the calves have great strength. If there is enough water and grass, the calves will be willing to grow. Breeding does not matter much." From the above materials, it seems that places like Niuxin ＠ with abundant water and grass have good conditions for developing livestock. In addition to proper feeding, if they can pay good attention to selecting cattle breeds, breeding will make great progress.

　　阳城牛心＠牧畜业调查
    牛心＠是太岳阳城六区麻台村管的一个小庄，在析城出北边的山＠是个背阴地方，气候很冷，庄稼很容易被霜打死；可是山上草长的很旺，水也不缺。据说还有二百多种药苗。牛、骡、驴、马吃了这里的草能去病，几天就能吃的又肥又壮。因为有这些条件，牛心＠的农民们除了种地以外，都把喂牲口作为主要的副业。很早以前，这庄上才十几户人家，就养有四五十个牲口；民国十九年增加到二十六户，牲口光牛就有二百多头，驴有二三十个，羊有四百多只；牛犊、驴驹每年能添三十多个，每年挑老的、小的、身架不好的卖到外边，每户平均能卖一个牲口。自从民国十九年孙殿英的队伍抢走了十三个母驴、一个公牛以后，驴就大大减少了、在抗日战争时期，经过“十二月政变”后，蒋、阎匪军连年抢驴、杀羊，损失的损失、糟踏的糟踏，大家也都没心思喂了。一九四二年解放以后，民主政府提倡发展生产，这里的牲口才慢慢的开始恢复。现在共有三十七户人家，有七十一头牛、两个驴、一百多只羊，前年收了十七个牛犊，去年收了十三个牛犊。张小门的母牛，前年正月下了一个母犊，腊月又下了一个公犊，去年又下了一个了。张五轩的老母牛，一年一个地一直下了十一年。拿现在跟抗战以前来比，虽说还差得很远，可是牲畜的繁殖还是不慢的。在这里因为向来都是把喂养牲口当成主要的副业，在喂养和照管牲口上有不少经验：第一、在平常的喂养和管理上，他们说：“牛是火畜不能受热”，夏天都是把牛拦在野地里；冬天牛又不能受冷，冷了就要病，冬天就要把圈收拾的暖和些。“一暖三分力”在每一个牛圈门上都挂上草帘子，早晨卷起，晚上放下，既能流通空气，又能保存温暖。冬天要马煎滚过的小麻油母牛喝上两三回，这样能暖胃、消肠火。早晨水凉不叫牛饮水，晚上饭水也不合适，因为夜里牛就要卧倒，把水窝在肚里不好，最好是晌午饮水，饮了以后牛还在运动，能多吃草。冬天春天给牛吃上些料汤，夏天喂上两三次盐，都能使牛肯吃、保上膘、筋骨有劲。第二、在牲口配种的时间上，他们的经验是：“配牛六、七、八月最好；配驴二、三、四月最好”，因为牛怀九个月，驴怀一年，要是赶到春天下犊生驹，气候温和，牧草肥嫩，母牛、母驴不落膘，犊、驹也好抚养。夏天热，冬天冷，犊、驹不好扶养，母牛、母驴也吃不住劲。第三、防治牲口病上，他们每年总要到护驾村请兽医李先生来检查几回，该扎针的扎针，该放血的放血，该吃药的吃药，这样牲口就少害病。要是偶一病死一个，就要连皮埋在地下，把病牲口圈里的粪出净，把圈也用火燎了；就是发生了牛瘟，也能很快的扑灭。可是他们在配种上，也有一点注意不到的地方，因为他们常常是公牛、母牛一大群随便交配，没有很好的选种，牛犊虽说下的不少，可是个子都不大。杨柏村的人笑话他们的牛群说：“簸箍子就能扣住好几个”，他们却说：“母牛奶性好，小牛发劲就大，再要水草足，犊牛就肯长，种不种没多大关系。”从上边这些材料看来，象牛心＠这样水草充足的地方，是很有条件发展牲畜的；除了喂养得毗，再能很好的注意到选择牛种，繁殖就会有很大的进步。
