This newspaper's "Questions and Answers" column is for resolving readers' difficult problems.

Editor:

I currently have a question that I intend to send to you for an answer. It's about fifty or so words long. I don't know how much it will cost? Please send me a letter explaining this, hoping for a response!

(Liu Qinglin, Shijiazhuang First Middle School)

Comrade Liu Qinglin:

The People's Daily is a newspaper directly led by the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, meaning it speaks for the workers and peasants of North China and serves the people of North China. To further connect with the masses, resolve their difficult problems, and reflect their demands, this newspaper has specifically opened columns such as "Voices of the Masses" and "Questions and Answers" to meet the needs of the masses. If you have any difficulties, any opinions, or any requests, as long as they are truthful and legitimate, you can write to tell us. We will definitely try our best to resolve them. If you cannot write, you can ask someone else to write for you. As long as it is written clearly, the quality of the writing does not matter much. If you are close to the newspaper office, we welcome you to come in person. You ask how much it costs to have a question answered, which is completely unnecessary. Serving the readers is our responsibility, and we will never charge any fees. Please write directly with your questions!

　　本报“询问与答复”栏是给读者解决疑难问题
    编辑同志：
    我现在有一个问题，打算去信烦你们给我解答，大约有五十多个字，不知需用多少钱？请你们给我来信说明为盼！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（石家庄市第一中学刘清霖）刘清霖同志：
    人民日报是中共中央华北局直接领导的报纸，也就是代表华北工人农民说话，为华北人民服务的报纸，为了更进一步的与群众联系，解决群众疑难问题，反映群众的要求，本报特辟了“群众呼声”、“询问答复”等几栏，以满足群众的需要，你有什么疑难，有什么意见，有什么要求，只要是真实的、正当的，都可写信来告诉我们，我们一定尽量想法解决。如果你不会写字，可以请别人代笔，只要写明白，文字的好坏没有多大关系；如果你离报社近，亲自前来，我们也很欢迎。你问给你解答一个问题需用多少钱，这是完全不必要的；为读者服务，这是我们的责任，绝不收任何代价。你有什么问题就请直接写来吧！　—编者
