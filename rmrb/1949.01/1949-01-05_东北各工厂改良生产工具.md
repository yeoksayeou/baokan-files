Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. Recently, certain inventions and improvements in tools in the Northeast Liberated Areas have made great contributions to improving industrial and agricultural production: (1) The Farm Implement Factory in Jiamusi City, Northeast China, has recently successfully tested improved plows, harvesters, and threshers in the field. The plow, pulled by four horses, can cultivate at least 18 mu per day, saving two horse labors and cultivating 10 more mu compared to the old plow. The harvester is suitable for harvesting general short-stem crops. With two horses and one worker, it can harvest 50 mu of soybeans per day, which is ten times more efficient than manual labor. The thresher is suitable for threshing both long and short-stem crops. With four horses and four workers, it can thresh 25 shi of grain per day, which is more than four times the amount of the old method, and the quality is also better than that of the old method. (2) In early November, when the Tongbei Mechanical Farm in Heilongjiang Province was tasked with threshing over 6,400 mu of sorghum, the use of an International Harvester wheat thresher resulted in one-third of the sorghum losing its skin and turning into rice, which not only affected the commercial price of the grain but also affected the seeds for next year. After discussion among the workers of the farm, the machine was modified, which overcame the above-mentioned drawbacks and increased the working efficiency of the machine by six times. (3) Li Zhonglian, a staff member of the Engineering Section of a steel plant in Northeast China, and his colleagues, after more than three months of research, used 5.6% aluminum, 18.9% chromium, and other elements to make aluminum-chromium electric heating wire (electric furnace wire) to replace the nickel-chromium wire originally manufactured by the plant. It has good heat resistance, a higher melting point than nickel-chromium, a small density, is easy to use, and has strong gas resistance. Nickel is a precious metal, raw materials are scarce, and the cost is high, while the use of aluminum can reduce the cost by 94.5% to 95.5%. (4) The Songjiang Province Glue Factory in Northeast China has recently successfully developed a special glue for making matches. The glue is characterized by not being hygroscopic and not igniting easily. The results after testing by the Nenjiang Match Factory are good. Tang Guangzhong and other workers at the Hengmao Factory in Harbin have also recently discovered that adding fish maw to the raw materials for making rubber rollers for printing makes the rubber rollers very strong, heat-resistant, and non-melting, and they do not shed residue during printing. (5) The Dongjian Oil and Fat Chemical Company in Harbin has improved the manufacturing of refined oil machines, and the refined oil produced can replace transformer oil, with insulation resistance above 25,000 volts. It is currently being manufactured in large quantities. (6) The Yumin Iron and Wood Factory in Rehe produced more than 50 animal-powered cotton gins (cotton carding machines) at the end of October. There are two types of cotton gins. One type can be pulled by one donkey pulling two machines, and the other type can be pulled by only one small donkey. Each machine can card 100 to 120 jin of cooked cotton per day, which is one to one and a half times higher than the old-fashioned cotton gin's output of only 50 jin of cooked cotton. Moreover, the carded cotton is whiter and cleaner, and the spun thread is also better.

　　东北各工厂改良生产工具
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】东北解放区最近在某些工具上面的创造与改良，对提高工农业生产极有贡献：（一）东北佳木斯市农具工厂，最近改造之走犁、收割机、打场机等，已实地试验成功。走犁，用四匹马拉，每天至少能开荒十八亩，比旧犁能省两个马工，能多开十亩地。收割机，适合收割一般短棵农作物，每天两个马一个人工能割豆子五十亩，比人工能提高十倍。打场机，打长短棵农作物均适合，一天用四匹马，四个人工，能打二十五石粮，比旧法打场可提高数量四倍强，质量亦较旧法所打为好。（二）黑龙江省通北机械农场十一月上旬担负六千四百余亩高粱的脱谷任务时，因使用万国牌小麦脱谷机，结果使高粱有三分之一掉皮成米，不但影响粮食的商品价格，且影响明年的籽种。后经全场工友讨论，将该机改造，即克服了上述的弊病，并提高了机械的工作效能六倍。（三）东北某炼钢厂工务科员李仲连和工友们经三个多月的研究，以百分之五点六的铝和百分之十八点九的铭及其他原素制成铝铭电热线（电炉丝）、代替该厂原制造的镍铬线。其耐热性良好，熔点比镍铬高，密度小，使用方便，耐瓦斯性强，且镍为贵金属，原料缺乏，成本又高，而改用铝后可减低成本百分之九四点五至九十五点五。（四）东北松江省制胶厂。最近研究成功一种制造火柴专门用的皮胶，该胶特点为不反潮不走火，经嫩江火柴工厂试验后结果良好。哈尔滨恒茂工厂工友唐广忠等最近亦研究出在制印刷用的胶滚原料中加放鱼瞟，使制出胶滚非常有筋力，耐热不融，印刷时也不掉渣。（五）哈尔滨东建油脂化学公司，改善制造清油机，制造出的清油可以代替变压器油，绝缘耐压在二万五千伏特以上，现正大量制造中。（六）热河裕民铁木工厂，十月底制出畜力风弓（弹花机）五十多架。该项风弓有两种，一种一个驴能拉两架，一种只有一个小驴即可拉动。每天每架能弹熟花一百斤至一百二十斤，比旧式风弓只弹熟花五十斤产量提高一倍至一倍半。而且弹的花又白又净，纺出的线亦好。
