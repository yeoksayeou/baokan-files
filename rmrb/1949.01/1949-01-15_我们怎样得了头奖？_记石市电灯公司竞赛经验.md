How We Won the First Prize?
  　Experiences from the Shijiazhuang Electric Company Competition
    The Electrical Testing Laboratory has a total of seven people: a section chief, three workers, an engineer who also helps with the work, and five apprentices, three of whom started work in December. Before December, as many people pointed out in the year-end summary, "The Electrical Testing Laboratory is a real mess!" Lateness and early departures were common. Sometimes, even the person in charge of attendance had to hear sarcastic remarks like, "Have some conscience!"; during the period of war preparedness, management was even more chaotic, and some tools were lost; some people were thinking about doing outside jobs to earn some extra money. They themselves even said, "It's really difficult; everyone has their own agenda, and no one can get along with anyone else." The section chief had also discussed with the leadership several times how to rectify the situation, but in the end, they all sighed and said, "It's not easy; no one listens."

    When the December competition began, the Women's Federation took the lead, proposing competition conditions and specifically challenging the testing laboratory. The blackboard bulletin also featured competition plans from various units one after another. When the comrades in the testing laboratory saw this, they all felt a surge of energy, mixed with a bit of unwillingness to be outdone and a bit of itchiness to participate. One person asked another, "What do we do?" and the other retorted, "What do you think we should do?" Some said, "Don't listen to their bragging!" Others said, "No matter how hard they try, they can't produce money. As long as we work hard, we're sure to increase the company's income." But in the afternoon, they spontaneously held a meeting, discussed it for a long time, and the final conclusion was: "Everyone should work hard and not let people look down on us like that again, but we won't say anything. We'll work hard and see what happens at the end of the month!" In addition, everyone felt that there hadn't been good division of labor in the past. When there was work to do, either you passed it to me or I passed it to you, or some were busy while others were idle. This time, that wouldn't do. Everyone discussed the work that needed to be done, then divided up the tasks, deciding that the engineer and one apprentice would specialize in rectifiers, two workers and one apprentice would specialize in transformers, and the section chief and one worker would lead three apprentices to do more complex work.

    From the next day onwards, everyone came early and worked with a will. Some didn't go home for lunch, bringing some dry food to heat on the stove, eating it and then continuing to work. At 5:30 p.m., when it was time to hold group meetings, everyone was still reluctant to leave their work, eager to do three or five more tasks. The two groups doing rectifiers and transformers, seeing that their work was almost done, automatically came to help wind the 25-horsepower motor. Some even secretly worked overtime at night to help others. Each group planned its own material needs, overcoming the past phenomenon of grabbing materials randomly. They were also very careful to save materials, hiding new cotton threads under the floorboards and first wiping greasy things with dirty cotton threads before using new ones. In the second half of the month, almost everyone was planning how to complete their own work and how to save time. Many temporary jobs came up, but they were determined to complete their original plans. A 20 kVA transformer was made once but wasn't suitable, then made again but still wasn't suitable. They made a third attempt and finally made it work. The head of the Engineering Department said, "The people in the testing laboratory are really working hard. This month's work is equal to more than two months in the past." When it came time to settle accounts at the end of the month, none of them received overtime pay.

    In one month, they completed their tasks, making four high-voltage rectifiers, twenty-four low-voltage rectifiers, testing and installing eight 50 kVA transformers, and repairing two transformers. Only a 300 kVA ultra-high-voltage transformer and a 25-horsepower motor had been started, but they couldn't be baked because the hot air blower had been taken to another unit. In addition, they helped Jizhong repair a burned-out 100 kVA generator, made two 15 kVA transformers themselves, made two extra high-voltage rectifiers, eight low-voltage rectifiers, and tested two generators and transformers. When the competition evaluation committee met, everyone agreed that although other units had also completed or exceeded their tasks, they couldn't compare with the testing laboratory. They not only exceeded their tasks but also underwent the best transformation, and should receive the first prize in the company's December competition.

    The Electric Company's general branch also held a meeting to discuss this matter, reviewing that the leadership had faults in the past. They only saw their shortcomings, didn't pay attention to their strengths, and passively restricted the development of their shortcomings. They didn't realize that workers are very straightforward, relatively easy to mobilize, and will do what they say. As long as they actively stimulate their self-esteem and sense of responsibility towards the revolutionary cause, and raise their production enthusiasm, those shortcomings will naturally be overcome after mobilization.

    At the Electric Company's December competition summary meeting on January 5th, the testing laboratory was awarded a mirror with the inscription "Combining Effort with Technology" by Comrade Liu Xiufeng. Comrade He Guang, the general branch secretary, said at the meeting, "I hope the testing laboratory will strengthen unity and maintain the production level of December."

　　我们怎样得了头奖？
  　记石市电灯公司竞赛经验
    电气试验室一共有七个人，一个股长，三个工人，一个工务员也帮着做活，五个学徒，其中三个是十二月才上班的。在十二月以前，正象在总结全年工作中好些人提出的“电气试验室真是乱得糟！”迟到早退是常事，有时管出勤的还得听“你可积点德”的一两句怪话；备战期间，管理更乱些，丢了一些工具；有的心里思想着做一些外活、好多闹两个钱花。他们自己有的也说：“真难办，一个人一个心眼，谁和谁也闹不在一起。”股长也和领导上研究过几回，怎样来整顿一下，但最后都叹着气说：“不好办，那一个也不听话。”
    十二月竞赛开始，妇联小组响了头一炮，她们提出了竞赛条件，而且指名向试验室挑战，黑板报上也接二连三的出现各单位的竞赛计划。试验室的哥儿们看到了，心里都蹩了一股劲，又是有点不服气，又是有点心痒痒的。你问着我：“怎么样？”我也反问着你：“怎样啦！”有的说：“别听他们吹！”有的说：“他们怎样努力，也生产不出钱来，我们只要一干，保险增加公司的收入。”但是下午他们自动开了个会，讨论了老半天，最后的结论是：“大家应当好好干，不要让人家再那样看咱们了，不过咱们也不说，埋头苦干，到月底见！”另外大家又觉得过去没有很好分工，有了工作不是你推我、我推你，就是忙的忙，闲的闲。这次可不能那样了，大家把应当做的工作商量好，再把工分了一下，决定工务员和一个学徒专做变流器，二个工人和一个学徒专做变压器，股长和一个工人带三个学徒做较复杂的活。
    从第二天起，大家都早早就来了，一股劲的干着，有的不回家去吃午饭，带了点干粮来，在火炉上烤热，吃了又干，下午五点半下班，应当是开小组会的时候了，但大家还都不愿离开活，还要抢着干它三五下。做变流器与变压器的两个组，看自己的活差不多了，就自动来帮助缠廿五马力的电动机；有的还晚上偷偷的加夜班来帮助别人干，领材料是各组计划自己的，克服了过去乱抓的现象；对材料也非常注意节省，新的棉丝都赶紧藏在掉子底下，油腻的东西，都先用脏的棉丝擦过，然后再用新棉丝擦。到了后半月差不多每个人都在计划怎样完成自己的工作，怎样能节省时间，临时来活很多，但决心一定还要完成原先的计划，一个容量二十的变压器，做了一次不合适，又做了一次还不合适，再来个第三次，终于把它做好。工务处长说：“试验室的人们真干到十分，这一月工作总顶住过去两个多月。”到月底算帐的时候，他们真的一个也没有领加班费。
    一个月下来，他们完成了自己的任务，做了高压变流器四个，低压变流器二十四个，试验和装置容量五十的变压器八台，修理变压器二台，只有容量三百特高压用的变压器和二十五马力电动机已制起，但因热风机拿到别的单位用去，没有烤出来。额外他们帮助冀中修理好一台烧毁的容量一百的发电机，自制了两台容量十五的变压器，多做了二个高压变流器，八个低压变流器，还试验了两台发电机与变压器。在竞赛评定委员会开会的时候，大家都认为别的单位，虽然也都完成或超过了任务，但还比不上试验室，他们不但超过了任务，而且转变得最好，应当得公司十二月竞赛的第一奖。
    电灯公司总支也曾开会讨论这件事，检讨到过去领导上是有毛病的，只是看到他们的一些毛病，没注意他们的长处，而消极的限制他们毛病的发展，没有认识到工人是很干脆的，比较容易发动，说干就干，说动员起来就起来，只要积极的启发他们的自尊心与对革命事业的责任心，提高他们的生产热情在动员起为之后，那些毛病就自然而然的克服了。
    一月五日的电灯公司十二月竞赛的总结大会上，奖给了试验室一面有刘秀峰同志题以“努力与技术相结合”字样的镜子。总支书记贺光同志在会上说：“希望试验室更加强团结，把十二月的生产水平保持下来。”
