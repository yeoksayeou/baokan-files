　　Group: Who says it isn't? Look at him, guarding the machine for eight hours straight at work, and after work, he goes to the union for meetings after class. He couldn't even recognize his own name before, but in the past six months, he's learned six or seven hundred characters!
　　Three: (Disdainfully) Of course he's eager, that's how they elected him as the union's group leader!
　　Hun: (Resentfully) What's so eager about it? I could be that eager too, with his long tongue, all slick and flattering, a pure opportunist!
　　Mother: You little bastard, talking nonsense! Why don't you take a piss and look at your own reflection? Ten of you couldn't match one of him, how dare you criticize him!
　　Group: (Admonishing) Erhun, you can't be so willful anymore. You can't just eat and sleep like you used to. Look at all the young people, singing, learning to read, and throwing themselves headfirst into their work! If you don't improve, you'll be left behind!
　　Hun: (Impatiently) Okay, okay, stop lecturing me. If I wanted to listen, I would have gone to the political class!
　　Mother: You're still being so stubborn! The group leader is trying to guide you in the right direction, and you won't listen! You didn't work hard when you first came to the factory. Now that you're working for yourself, if you act like that again, not only will the group leader scold you, but I won't allow it either!
　　Hun: (Impatiently) Why are you yelling so loud? Did you bring me money or not?
　　Mother: (Anxiously) What do you need money for anyway? – (To the crowd) You see, this kid keeps asking me for money, keeps asking me for money. He asked me again this morning before work. (Resentfully asks Hun) Tell me, what do you need money for?
　　Hun: (Stammering) I have my uses, just give me the money! – You're stingy with money like it's a millstone!
　　(Mother frowned and looked angry. Zheng enthusiastically enters)
　　Zheng: (Happily) I handed in a template, the director was so happy! The director said the factory really needed this thing. As soon as I gave it to him, he told the administrator to make a sign!
　　Group: See, I told you so! The director will definitely reward you for handing it in. This isn't just good for you; it makes our security section look good!
　　Three: Zhengyi, with this, our security section has one more tool!
　　Zheng: (Enthusiastically runs to Hun) The director even asked about you. He said I should take responsibility as the union's group leader, and encourage you to learn from Group Leader Wang so we can all improve together! …
　　Hun: (Angrily) Bullshit!
　　Zheng: (Confused) Hey, what's wrong with you?!
　　Group: Don't provoke him, he's already angry!
　　Mother: (Advising Hun) Look at you, never growing up, never maturing. I must have done something wrong in a past life to have a son like you, never making progress! Look at how good Zhengyi is. If you were half as good as him, I'd be patting my shoe and chanting Buddhist prayers!
　　Group: Alright, alright, Aunt Zhang, don't say things you don't mean. The kid will improve slowly. Erhun, you should be more aware, go to class more often, and learn more. Now that we're liberated, don't be like you used to be! … (To the crowd) It's time, let's get to work. (To Zheng) Zhengyi, hurry up and eat!
　　(Group and Three pick up their tools, ready to work. Mother gets up to leave, seeing Hun still moving slowly, unwilling to move.)
　　Mother: (Covering the lunch box, to Hun) There's still a bun here, eat it when you're hungry!
　　Group: (Working, advising everyone) Let's make sure we load the truck properly!
　　Zheng: (Eating happily) The director even asked me if this truck would be ready to go next week, saying the registered female workers keep asking him about it. … I think it can leave safely!
　　(The stage is quiet for a moment. The air raid siren sounds urgently. The crowd quickly puts down their tools.)
　　Group: (Nervously) Air raid! Let's go find shelter!
　　(At the same time, shouting from backstage: "Air raid!" "Quick, turn off the machine!" "Turn off the machine!" "...")
　　(Group, Three, and Zheng, cursing, exit.)
　　Hun: (Running behind, reaches the door, sees everyone has left, looks around, sees the stage is empty, turns back in a panic, talking to himself) If you don't give me money, see if I don't have my own ways! (Opens the lunchbox, takes out the bun and puts it in his pocket, picks up the lunchbox, walks towards the oil drum, suddenly hears a voice outside the door.)
　　Voice: Run, run! …
　　Hun: (Looks outside in alarm, sees no one, then walks to the oil drum, lifting the oil into the lunchbox little by little. He thinks it is too slow, so he simply uses the lunchbox to pour it. He fills one box, puts it on the table, and picks up another box to pour. Both boxes are full. As he lifts them, he spills some oil by accident, which splashes on "Regardless"’s clothes. He is frustrated) Damn it, what bad luck! I made such a big stain, what am I going to do, what am I going to do? … (Rubs it with his hands, suddenly hears voices outside the door.)
　　Voice: Sanbuguan, why are you still running in there?!
　　Three: (Voice from outside) It's too cold in the bomb shelter, I'm just getting a coat!
　　Voice: (Sternly) Hurry up and come back!
　　Hun: (Extremely panicked, rolls the oily part of "Regardless"’s clothes inward, picks up the lunchbox and runs out. Three enters, the two collide head-on.)
　　Three: Hey, Erhun, why are you just coming out now?
　　Hun: (Panic-stricken, stammering) I… (Exits in a fluster.)
　　Three: (Looks at Hun leaving suspiciously, turns back and suddenly finds oil on the table, suspiciously) Hey! Why is there oil here? (Looks at the oil drum and then at the oil drips on the ground.) Damn it, this kid probably stole oil! … (Angrily) Still stealing at a time like this?! … (Internal struggle, wants to report but suppresses it) … Ah! Forget it, he's not stealing from my family, so who cares! Why make enemies, it's not worth it! (Picks up the clothes, puts them on, the oil on the back is clearly visible to the audience) (Exits.) (Brief pause.) (Air raid siren stops, people shout again!)
　　Voice: It's over, let's go! Let's go!
　　(Group, Er, Three, and Zheng enter.)
　　Group: (Entering and saying) Damn it, we must have liberated some big place again, Chiang Kai-shek is running out of options!
　　Three: Damn it, why don't the planes fall down and kill those bastards!
　　Zheng: Just wait! Tianjin and Beiping will be liberated soon, he won't be around for long!
　　Group: They sound the alarm several times a day, the alarms alone are delaying our work!
　　Zheng: Really, (sarcastically) that Chiang Kai-shek is a bit "rolling around on the ground after losing his house, loath to leave his native soil"! No matter how much you disrupt us, we still have to get the work done. … I'm not eating anymore! (Packs up the lunchbox.)
　　Group: Right! Erhun, work harder! Once we get this machine loaded, your wife will be able to start work next week! (Three, Group, and Hun start working.)
　　Zheng: (Packing the lunchbox, suddenly finds oil on the table, (Surprised) Hey! Why is there so much oil on the table? (Points to the table.)
　　Group: (Without paying much attention) Probably someone was adding spindle oil!
　　Zheng: Adding spindle oil wouldn't get it on the table! (Finds oil on the ground again) Hey, look, how did the oil get all over the floor near the drum?
　　Group: (Puts down the tool, responsibly starts looking at the table, oil drum, and floor.) Hey! That's right! How is there so much on the ground?
　　Zheng: (Affirmatively) Someone must have come here to steal oil when the air raid alarm went off!
　　Group: (To Three and Hun) Hey, did you see anyone come in here just now?
　　Hun: (Heart pounding, unsure of "Three's" attitude, stammers, unable to answer.) …
　　Three: Didn't see anyone!
　　Zheng: (Angrily) Impossible! If no one was here, how would the oil get all over the table and the floor?
　　Group: That's right! We can't just brush this off, we have to investigate carefully!
　　Three: (Runs to the group leader, trying to minimize the situation) Hey! Don't get worried, stealing a little oil isn't worth much! You couldn't pay me to steal! (Gives Erhun a look, trying to get on his good side.)
　　Hun: I didn't see anyone take anything!
　　Zheng: (Stamps his foot, angrily) Damn it! Which bastard is messing with us here! … (Suddenly notices a large patch of oil on "Three's" back) … Hey! Why is there such a big patch of oil on your back?
　　Three: (In disbelief) No way! (Unbuttons and takes off the jacket.)
　　Group: (Steps forward to look, affirmatively) That's right! What else could it be? …
　　Zheng: (Convincing himself that Three is the thief, calmly advises) Hey! Regardless, let's just say what we know!
　　Three: This, this, this... (Anxiously unable to speak.)
　　Zheng: Hey! A good man takes responsibility for his actions, what's the big deal if you tell us!
　　Group: Regardless! If you did it, just admit it!
　　Three: (Anxiously) This, this, this, but it's not...
　　Zheng: Regardless! We young people shouldn't be so hesitant when handling things!
　　Three: This, this, this... (Forced to the point, grits his teeth and says firmly) It wasn't me!
　　Zheng: (Angrily) The oil's on your body, if it wasn't you, who else would it be?!
　　Group: Regardless! We're talking to you nicely, don't hide anything! If you don't admit it, don't blame us for being rude!
　　Three: (Feeling wronged) You can't accuse an innocent person!
　　Zheng: Don't play dumb! One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel. One person can ruin the reputation of our security section, and you're still saying we're accusing an innocent person!
　　Group: The oil's on your body, you've been caught red-handed, what else do you have to say!
　　Three: (Determined, stamps his foot, points at Hun) Erhun!!
　　Hun: You're lying!
　　Three: You're the one who stole it!
　　Hun: (Rolls up his sleeves and steps forward, wanting to hit Three) Damn it, you're slandering me!
　　Group: (Hurries to pull them apart) Hey! Don't fight, what's going on?
　　Three: I didn't steal it, the oil on my body must have been from Erhun!
　　Zheng: You need evidence to catch an adulterer, and stolen goods to catch a thief. Why are you saying it must have been Erhun?
　　Three: I saw him when the air raid alarm went off!
　　Hun: (Steps forward wanting to hit Three) You're full of it, I think you don't want to live anymore!
　　Group: (Stopping him) Erhun, don't move! (To Three) Regardless, tell us slowly, what happened?
　　Three: I saw Erhun stealing it when the air raid alarm went off! (Asks Hun) Erhun, what were you carrying in the lunchbox when you ran out just now?
　　Hun: (Unable to answer, equivocating) … Nothing!
　　Three: Nothing? I was in the bomb shelter, it was too cold, I came back to get a coat, and as soon as I walked in, I ran into him carrying a lunchbox, I looked and the table and the floor were covered in oil, if he didn't steal it, who did? …
　　Zheng: (Interjects) Then how did you get oil on your body?
　　Three: When we were eating, I took off my coat and put it next to his lunchbox, the lunchbox must have bumped into my coat! … Erhun, would you say I wronged you?
　　Hun: If you saw me getting oil on you, why didn't you catch me on the spot?
　　Three: I grabbed my coat and ran, who had time to worry about that!
　　Zheng: Regardless! Is what you're saying true or false?
　　Group: This isn't a joke, we have to say what's true and not make things up!
　　Three: (Extremely angry, swears) We have to do things according to our conscience, if I'm making things up, I'll die a terrible death, get run over by a car in the street, and get caught in the machinery at the factory and be crushed! Erhun, if you're lying, you'll suffer the same fate!
　　Hun: (Unreasonably denies) That's all a curse on yourself!
　　Group and Zheng: (Seeing that Three is extremely angry, soothingly ask) Regardless! Don't worry… then why didn't you report him just now?
　　Three: I saw him running out with oil, I wanted to report him, but I thought, "Damn it, this kid is still stealing oil!" But then I thought, ah! Forget it, anyway, he's stealing oil from the factory, it won't affect my family much, reporting him will make enemies, it's not worth it; besides, I might mess up someday, if I report him this time, won't he report me next time...
　　Zheng: (Dejectedly) So you're such a coward, that's disappointing! Really disappointing!
　　Group: Erhun, is what Sanbuguan is saying true?
　　Hun: (Acts like a rogue) He's accusing me!
　　Zheng: Why doesn't he accuse me then?
　　Hun: You say I stole it, show me the evidence!
　　Three: Where did you put the lunchbox?
　　Group and Zheng: (Ask in unison) Yes! Where did you put the lunchbox?
　　Hun: (Unable to answer, pauses) My lunchbox, I can put it wherever I want, you can't stop me from smashing it!
　　Group: (Patiently advising) Erhun, don't be so confused! Who are you hurting by doing this? Do you know how this spindle oil is made? …
　　Hun: (Silent) …
　　Zheng: You can't buy it cheaply in Shijiazhuang right now, back in the Kuomintang days, it was all transported by plane. In the first few days after liberation, the workers took a lot of the spindle oil out, but once the factory opened, the workers automatically brought it back.
　　Group: That's right! This is the time we need oil the most, if we run out of oil, the spindles won't turn. Think about it, if the machine stops, how are we going to eat!
　　Three: If you steal this oil, the entire factory of over a thousand workers will suffer!
　　Hun: (Hearing Three say this, is about to get angry again) You! …
　　Group: (Stopping Three) Don't say anything!
　　Zheng: If we run out of oil, the machines that are running will have to stop, and the newly installed military machines can't start; those who are working will have to stop, and those who aren't working will have no hope, what's the point of your wife even thinking about working?
　　Hun: (His heart is gradually softening, but he still refuses to admit it) I didn't steal it anyway!
　　Group: (Still patiently persuading) Erhun, don't be so stubborn, by stealing you're hurting yourself, hurting your wife and children, and hurting everyone! (The administrator happily carries a sign and goes to the industrial affairs department.)
　　Admin: Everyone come and see! Zhengyi is being praised! (Hangs up the sign. The crowd is silent.) Let me read it to you… "Worker Zhengyi of the fine yarn security department is commended for donating a template."… (The crowd remains silent. The administrator asks in surprise) Hey! Why aren't you coming to see?
　　Zheng: Something happened!
　　Group: We found out that Erhun stole spindle oil! We're investigating it!
　　Admin: (Astonished) What, Erhun stole oil?
　　Group: (Points to the praise sign) Erhun, look at Zhengyi, and look at yourself, one is in heaven and the other is on earth; he took things that were stolen from the enemy in the past and brought them back for the factory to use, while you're stealing things that the factory is currently using; since liberation, the factory director has been leading our thousand-plus workers, treating night like day, and day like night, working hard for over half a year, from winter until now, to rebuild the factory that Chiang Kai-shek bombed and burned down, everyone just got ahold of this rice bowl, our lives are just starting to be secure, and you're coming to sabotage it, who do you think you're letting down?!
　　Admin: Erhun, you shouldn't have done that. Since liberation, our factory has respected the workers' dignity, and eliminated body searches. Everyone has treated the factory as their own home, protecting and building it, but you're the only one doing this kind of thing, aren't you damaging everyone's reputation?
　　Zheng: (Excitedly) That's right, you're still doing this at this time, you're like a ghost on the looking-homeward platform, oblivious to your impending death!
　　Hun: (Originally speechless, but is angered by Zheng's comment, hurting his self-esteem, and explodes.) What do you think you're doing? If you say anything more, I quit! (Hun is about to walk out, but Mother's voice is heard from outside.)
　　Mother: (Extremely angry, voice trembling) Erhun! (Rushes in with a lunchbox) Is this the good thing you've done! (Sees Hun about to leave and blocks him) Where are you going, how am I supposed to face people now? (Displays the lunchbox) You see, I didn't give him money, so he did this… how am I supposed to face people! How am I supposed to face people! (Pounces on, wanting to hit Hun, but is stopped by Group, Admin, etc.)
　　Group and Admin: Aunt Zhang, don't hit him, don't worry, calm down!
　　Three: (Runs to the lunchbox, opens it and confirms what he said, to the crowd) You see, there are exactly two boxes of oil! Exactly two boxes of oil! …
　　Group: Erhun, you can't deny it now, you have nothing to say! (Hun is speechless, lowers his head.)
　　Mother: (Still angry) Oh! You're going to kill me, I never thought you'd do this!… (Haughtily), when the air raid alarm lifted and came back, I only sat down to pick cotton for a short while, I got thirsty and went to get some water to drink from my lunchbox and discovered two boxes of oil, so angry, I was shaking! …Erhun, your mother wanted to be virtuous her entire life. Your mother is not that kind of person! (Becoming speechless)
　　Admin: Alright, alright, it's not worth getting so angry with him. (Helps Mother.)
　　Group: Erhun, it's alright if you do this, but look at how upset you've made your mother!
　　Mother: You little bastard, don't you think about who cured your mother's illness? …(Complains, cries) When the Kuomintang was in power and before autumn, your mother's old, sick body rested from several jobs, and the factory fired us because of this. We had nothing to eat, nothing to burn, and winter was coming, and everything was so expensive! Heaven and earth wouldn't accept us, I worried about how we could survive! I suffered and became worse every day! After the Liberation, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed the train station and the factory, leaving your mother unable to walk or run, my heart was being cut by knives, lying in bed, so sick that I couldn't get up. For more than half a month, I only drank a bit of thin rice soup, and people said your mother was not going to make it, and I would close my eyes and leave you behind! …(Cries) Luckily the factory found out and carried me to the hospital, gave me medicine, and injections, slowly but surely, and rescued your mother's old life back from the King of Hell, …now, don't you think that your mother looks like a real person and has gone back to work? You want to make me angry again! (Goes up to hit Hun)
　　Zheng, Group, Admin: "Aunt Zhang, it's not worth being so sad!" "You just recovered from your illness, don't hurt yourself!"
　　Mother: No, no! Everyone, don't stop me, I can't hold it in! Erhun, did you forget who lent you money to marry your wife? …Your father died when you were seven, and for eleven years, your mother was a widow with a small business, without much help. It took raising you to this age, and if it weren't for the Liberation, and the factory lending me the money, you wouldn't be able to marry a wife in this lifetime? When the Kuomintang was in power, who looked up to women like us?…
　　Zheng, Group, Admin: Okay, okay, Aunt Zhang, don't be so sad, try to think more optimistically, let him think for himself.
　　Mother: (More excited and loudly shouting) The factory cured your mother's illness, and lent you money to marry your wife, helping you start a family, and build a career, now the factory is your home, and your home is the factory, and you're stealing things from the factory, you profligate, ungrateful thing!…
　　Hun: (Moved, lowers his head and wipes his tears.)…
　　Group: Calm down, Aunt Zhang!
　　Admin: Erhun, you haven't told the truth after making your mother so upset!
　　Zheng: This is your chance to change, tell the truth!
　　Hun: (Shamefully and quietly) I was wrong?
　　(Female workers A, B, and C enter.)
　　A, B, C: What are you shouting about? What are you shouting about?
　　Admin: (To the female workers) Don't shout, listen first!
　　Mother: (Sternly) Tell me, how many times have you stolen?
　　Hun: Twice!
　　Mother: What did you steal last time?
　　Hun: Oil!
　　Mother: Where did the oil go?
　　Hun: Sold it!
　　Mother: Where's the money from the sale?
　　Hun: Went to a restaurant, saw a show.
　　Mother: Heartless bastard, did a dog eat your conscience? Did wolves devour it?
　　Female workers A, B, C: (Astonished, angrily) "Good heavens, Erhun stole things!" "So Erhun was stealing oil all along!"
　　Admin: Don't shout!
　　Three: (Coldly) No wonder Erhun knew that spindle oil was 198,500 yuan per catty, so you've stolen it before!
　　Group: (Stopping Three) Don't talk nonsense!
　　Female worker A: Stealing things damages everyone's reputation, fire him!
　　B: Punish him, this spindle oil is so scarce, and he's still stealing it!
　　C: Suspend his work, he's kicking everyone's rice bowl! (The crowd continues to shout.)
　　Group: Don't shout! We have a solution.
　　Mother: (Wiping away tears) Administrator, group leader, there are factory rules, punish him as you see fit, anyway I'm handing him over to the factory.
　　Admin: Everyone, don't shout, the factory has its own way; Aunt Zhang, don't be sad… Do you remember, on the day the factory reopened, the factory director told everyone that we are now liberated, and the workers' status has been raised! Everyone should consciously abide by the rules. Everyone should work honestly with two hands, not use a third hand to steal, and not work with one hand while the other rests. For several months now, everyone has been doing very well, except for Erhun, who is not aware, eating and drinking well while stealing things, this is destroying everyone's interests, now we will give him a certain punishment according to the labor discipline we have all agreed upon. But we must recognize one problem, Erhun's stealing is a crime left over from the old society, when the old society and the Four Great Families and those reactionary capitalists exploited us and didn't feed us enough, so many people had to steal from them, and at that time, stealing and sabotage was our struggle. But today we are different, today's state-owned factory is our home, we are the masters of the factory, so we should no longer have those old habits. This transformation of old habits is not just Erhun's problem, and we can't just solve the problem by firing Erhun. Erhun is still a member of our proletariat today, and although he has this bad habit, he still remembers the oppression of the class enemies. The punishment we give him today is to give him an education. Comrade Zhengyi's transformation is a good example for our workers. We should encourage Erhun to learn from him. At the same time, I hope everyone will pay attention together, and that this kind of thing won't happen again…
　　Zheng: (Seriously interjects) We also oppose people like Sanbuguan who can't see that stealing from the factory is destroying their own interests, and are afraid of making enemies and don't report it!
　　Crowd: Yes, oppose stealing, oppose the third hand! Oppose Sanbuguan!

    娘　你还这么混帐，组长是往好道领你哪，你还不听！先前你进厂来从不好好干，行了，这时候为自个干活儿你再那样，不用说组长说你，连我也不答应你！
    混　（不耐烦）你嚷起来这么大的劲儿，你给我带钱来没有？
    娘　（急）你到底要钱干什么呀？——（向众）你们看这小子见天跟我要钱，见天跟我要钱，今天早上上班又朝我要，（恨恨问混）你说，你到底要钱干什么？
    混　（吱唔地）反正我有用，你拿钱来吧！——看你拿一个钱比个碾盘还大哪！
    （娘在一边愁皱着脸生气，郑欢腾的上）
    郑　（高兴的）我交了一个活搬子，部长可高兴啦，部长说现在厂里正缺这个东西，我把东西一给他他就叫管理员写牌子去啦！
    组　看我说的不错吧，交了去部长一定奖励你，这一交不但你一个人好，咱们保全部都光彩体面！
    三　郑义，你这一交，咱们保全部又多了一样家伙！
    郑　（热情的跑到混面前）部长还问到你哪，他说叫我负起工会小组长的责任来，多劝着你点，好好跟王组长学手艺，咱们一块进步！……
    混　（气愤的）扯旦！
    郑　（莫明其妙）唉，你这是怎么回事呀？！
    组　你别惹他，他正在火头上哪！
    娘　（劝混）看你这个蒸不熟、煮不烂的劲儿，我哪辈子没有修了好，养了你这么个儿子，死不长进！你看人家郑义多好啊，你要有人家一半我也早拍着鞋帮子念佛啦！
    组　得啦，得啦，张大娘不要说气话啦，孩子家慢慢就进步啦。二混，你以后也自觉点儿，勤上点课，多懂点道理；现在解放了，不要学以前那样啦。……（向众）到点了，咱们干活去吧（向郑）郑义你赶紧吃你的！
    （组、三拿起家伙准备干活，娘起来欲走，见混仍慢腾腾的不爱动。）
    娘　（一面盖上饭盒，对混）这里还有个馒头哪，几时饿了你就吃！
    组　（一边工作，嘱咐大家）咱们注意把车装规矩！
    郑　（一边吃高兴的）刚才部长还问我，这部车下礼拜开了开不了，说登记的女工一个劲儿的追着问他。……叫我看保险开得了！
    （舞台稍静片刻，警报声急响，众急忙放下工具）
    组　（紧张的）拉警报啦，先出去躲躲吧！
    （同时，幕后乱喊声：“警报啦！”“快关车！”“把车关上！”“……”）
    （组、三、郑，一边骂着，下）
    混　（跑在后面，到门口，见众下，四下撒望，见台上空无一人，慌张的转回身来，自语）不给我钱，看我有办法没有！（打开饭盒，把馒头取出装进衣袋，拿起饭盒，向油桶迈步，忽听门外有声。）
    声　快跑，快跑！……
    混　（惊慌外望，见没人，又走到油桶跟前，将油一提提往饭盒装，嫌太慢，索性用饭盒灌；灌满一盒，放到桌上，取起另一盒又灌；两盒装满，慌张的往起一扣，不小心撒出油来，撒在“不管”衣服上，沮丧的）他妈的，真背兴，弄了这么一大块，这可怎么办，这可怎么办？……（用手急搓，忽然听到门外人声。）
    声　三不管，你怎么还往里头跑？！
    三　（在外声）防空洞里太阴，我穿件衣服！
    声　（严厉的）快去快回来！
    混　（慌张不已，把不管衣服油处往里一卷，提起饭盒往外跑，三上，二人撞个满怀）
    三　哎，二混，你怎么才出去呀？
    混　（警慌若失，吱唔）我……（狼狈而下）
    三　（疑惑的注视混下，回头忽发现桌上有油，怀疑的）唉！这儿怎么有油啊？（又看油桶又看地上的油滴）他妈的，这小子八成偷油啦！……（气愤的）这会儿还偷？！………（内心斗争欲报告又压下）……唉！算啦，偷也偷不着我家的，管他呢！何必得罪人哪，合不着！（拿起衣服披上便走，背后的油正好被观众看清）（下）稍停（解除警报声，外边又乱嚷起来！）
    声　解除啦，走啦！走啦！
    （组、二、三、郑上）
    组　（边上边说）他妈的，准是咱们又解放了什么大地方啦，蒋介石又穷极啦！
    三　他娘的，开飞机的怎么不掉下来，摔死他个狗日的！
    郑　等着吧！天津、北平眼看就要解放啦，他没有几天闹头啦！
    组　一天说不清来几回，光跑飞机就把活儿耽误啦！
    郑　真他妈的，（讽刺的）老蒋这小子，也是有点“去了房子打滚，热土难离”哟！不管你怎么扰乱，反正咱们得把活儿赶出来。……不吃啦！（收拾饭盒）
    组　对！二混干欢点啊！咱们这部车装好啦，下礼拜你媳妇就上班啦！（三、组、混开始干活。）
    郑　（收拾饭盒忽然发现桌上有油，（惊异的）唉！怎么桌上这么些个油哇？（指桌）
    组　（不加注意的）大概是有人加锭子油啦吧！
    郑　加锭子油也弄不到桌子上啊！（又发现地上有油）唉，你们看桶子哪儿弄得满地都是油啊！
    组　（放下工具，责任感的注意起来看桌上、油桶、地上。）唉！可也就是啊！怎么道儿上也这么多呀？
    郑　（肯定的）准是他妈的拉警报的时候有人到咱这儿偷油啦！
    组　（向三、混）唉，你们俩刚才见有人进来没有？
    混　（内心腾腾乱跳，不知“三”的态度，支吾答不出。）………
    三　没见有人来！
    郑　（激愤的）不能！要没有人，这油能自己跑到满桌子满地吗？
    组　是啊！这个事可不能马马虎虎，得仔细调查调查！
    三　（跑到组长跟前，压事的，）唉！你们别多心啦，偷那么一点油才直几个钱啊！你们叫我偷我也不偷！（向二混递眼色，买好。）
    混　我看也没有人拿！
    郑　（跺脚，激愤）他妈的！哪个混蛋上咱们这儿捣鬼来啦！……（忽然　发现“三”的脊背上有大块油）……唉！你脊梁上怎么这么一大块油哇？
    三　（惊恐不信）不能吧！（解扣脱衣）
    组　（上前一看，肯定的）可不是吗？这不是油是什么呀？……
    郑　（肯定认为是三偷的，缓和的规劝）唉！不管，咱们有什么说什么吧！
    三　（焦急否认）这这，这，这——（急的说不出来。）
    郑　唉！好汉做事好汉当，你说啦也不怎么啊！
    组　不管！是你做的，干脆你就承认了吧！
    三　（焦急的）这这这，可不是……
    郑　不管！咱们年青人办事，别那么半吞半咽的！
    三　这这这……（逼紧，咬牙吐出，坚决的）不是我！
    郑　（气愤）这油在你身上，不是你，还是我吗？！
    组　不管！我们好话跟你说，别瞒着啦！你要再不承认，可别怪我们对不起你！
    三　（委屈的）你们可不能冤枉好人啦！
    郑　你别装傻啦！一块臭肉坏了满锅汤，因为一个人就得坏了咱保全部的名誉，你还说冤枉好人哪！
    组　油在你的身上，真赃实犯，你还有什么说的！
    三　（狠心，跺脚，指混）二混！！
    混　你放屁！
    三　就是你偷的！
    混　（卷袖上前，欲打三）他妈的，你诬赖人！
    组　（忙上去拉开）唉！别打架，到底是怎么回事？
    三　不是我偷的，我身上的油一定是二混给弄的！
    郑　捉奸要双，捉贼要赃，你凭什么说一定是二混给你弄的？
    三　拉警报那会儿我见他来！
    混　（上去要打三）放你妈的屁，我看你不要好啦！
    组　（阻拦）二混，你不要动！（对三）不管，管你慢慢说，到底是怎么回事？
    三　拉警报的时候，我看二混在这儿偷来着！（问混）二混，你说你刚才往外跑，饭盒里提的什么？
    混　（答不上来，诡辩）……什么也没有！
    三　什么也没有？刚才我在防空洞里呆着，挺阴，回来穿件衣服，一进门正好碰上他提着饭盒往外跑，我一看，桌上、地上都是油，这不是他偷的是谁呀？……
    郑　（插一句）那么你身上这油是怎么弄的？
    三　吃饭的时候，我脱了衣服，挨着他的饭盒，准是他那饭盒撞在我衣裳上啦！……二混，你说我亏你不亏你？
    混　你见我给你弄油啦，为什么不当场捉住我呀？
    三　我拿上衣裳就跑啦，谁还多那份心哪！
    郑　不管！你这话到底是真是假？
    组　这个事可不是闹着玩的，咱们有一句说一句，可不能胡拉胡扯！
    三　（气愤至极，发誓）咱们做事得凭天理良心，我要胡拉胡扯，得不了好死，到大街上叫汽车轧死我，到厂里上皮带叫皮带绞死我一二混，你要说瞎话！你和我一样！
    混　（无理抵赖）全是骂的你自己！
    组　郑　（见三气急，抚慰的问）不管！不要着急。……那你刚才为什么不报告他哪？
    三　我一看他提着油往外跑，我有心给他报告，我想：“他妈的这小子，这会儿还偷油！”可是我又一捉摸，唉！算啦，反正他偷厂里的油，我家里也少不了什么，报告他了得罪人，合不着；再说，我以后也不能没个错儿，这回我要给他报告了，下回他不报告我吗……
    郑　（泄气地）闹了半天，你这么没出息呀，真泄气！真泄气！
    组　二混，三不管说这话对不对呀？
    混　（撒无赖）他屈说我！
    郑　他怎么不屈说我呀？
    混　你们说我偷，你们给我找出证据来！
    三　你说你把饭盒弄哪去啦？
    组　郑　（齐问）是啊！你把饭盒弄哪去啦？
    混　（答不上，停顿一下）我的饭盒，我愿意弄哪儿就弄哪儿，我砸了它你们也管不着！
    组　（耐心的劝说）二混，你别迷惑着心眼啦！你做这种事情对得起谁呀！你知道这锭子油怎么来的呀！……
    混　（不语）……
    郑　这会儿在石家庄贵贱买不到，国民党那会儿都是拿飞机载来的。刚解放的那两天，工人们把锭子油拿出去不少，厂里开了工，工人们才又自动的拿回来的。
    组　是啊！这会儿正是用油的时候，这油一缺，锭子就不能转啦，你想，一关车，咱们还指着什么吃哪！
    三　你把这油偷了，全厂一千多工人都跟你倒霉了！
    混　（听三说，又要发火）你！……
    组　（阻止三）不许你说！
    郑　这油一没了，开着的车都得停了，新装的军更开不了啦；上工的都得歇了，没上工的更不用说，你媳妇上工还有什么想头哪？
    混　（内心虽已逐渐服软，但口头上仍不肯承认）反正我没有偷！
    组　（仍耐心说服）二混，你别这么拧啦，你这么一偷是害你自己，害你媳女，害大伙儿！（管理员高兴的提着牌子，到工务部门上）
    管　大家来看哪！郑义受到表扬啦啊！（挂上牌子众不语）我给你们念念啊……“今有细纱保全部工人郑义，献出活板子一个，特表扬一次。”……（众仍沉默、管惊奇问）唉！你们怎么不来看哪？
    郑　出了事啦！
    组　我们这儿发现二混偷锭子油啦！正追究那！
    管　（惊异的）什么，二混偷油啦？
    组　（指表扬的牌子）二混，你看看人家郑义，看看你，真是一个天上，一个地下；人家把过去偷敌人的东西拿回来给厂里用，你把厂里正用着的东西往外偷；自从解放以来，厂长领着咱千数来工人，拿黑夜当白天，拿白天当黑夜，从冬天到现在，辛辛苦苦半年多的光景，才把让蒋介石给炸毁了烧焦了的厂子建设好，大家刚捧住这个饭碗，生活才有了保障，你又来破坏，你说你对得起谁哪？！
    管　二混，你可不该呀，自打解放以后，咱们厂里尊重工人的人格，取消了搜腰，大家都把厂子看成自个儿的家，爱护、建设，可你一个人做这样事，是不是坏大家的名誉呀？
    郑　（激动的）是啊，到这会儿你还干这个，真是望乡台上打蹦蹦不知死的鬼！
    混　（本来已无话可说，见郑说自己，伤了自尊心，不服劲的爆发。）你小子算干什么吃的？你再说我不干啦！（混正欲往外走，外有娘声。）
    娘　（气愤已极，声音发抖）二混！（手拿饭盒，急上）你气死我啦！这是你办的好事！（见混欲走堵住）你上哪儿去，你叫你娘怎么见人啦？（摆出饭盒）你们看我没给他钱，他办出这好事啦……你叫我怎么见人！你叫我怎么见人！（扑上，欲打混，被组、管等拦住。）
    组管　张大娘，别打啦，不要着急，消消气吧！
    三　（跑到饭盒前打开一看，证实他的话，向众）你们看正好两盒油吧！正好两盒油吧！………
    组　二混，这你可不嘴硬啦吧，没有可说啦吧！（混无话可说，低下头）
    娘　（仍气愤的）唉呀！你可气死我啦，我作梦也想不到你办这事！………（气呼呼的），拉警报回来，我才坐下检了不大一会儿棉花，我跑的怪渴的，拿起饭盒要去倒点水喝，一看两盒油，气的我混身打哆嗦！……二混，你娘要好一辈子啦，你娘可不是这样人儿！（气呼呼说不上话）
    管　得啦，得啦，值不当的跟他生那么大气。（扶娘）
    组　二混，你办这点事不要紧，把你娘气成什么样啦！
    娘　你个小王八羔子，你也不好好想想，是谁把你娘的病治好的？……（诉苦，哭）年上秋后国民党在的时候，你娘的老病身子多歇了几个工，厂里就把咱开除啦，吃没吃，烧没烧，眼瞅着冬天就来啦，东西都那么贵！天不收，地不留，我发愁这个日子可怎么过呀！折磨的你娘一天不如一天！解放以后，蒋介石的飞机炸了车站炸工厂，弄的你娘走走不动，跑跑不动，心里象刀子绞的似的，躺在床上病重的就起不来啦，有半个多月光喝点稀米汤，人家都说你娘不行啦，眼看着一合眼就顾不上你啦！……（哭）多亏厂里知道啦，把我抬到医院去，吃药、打针，紧治慢治，才把你娘这条老命打阎王爷那儿赎回来，……这会儿你是不是看你娘象个人儿似的又上了班啦？你又想把我气死呀！（上去打混）
    郑、组、管　“张大娘，值不得那么伤心啊！”“你病刚好了，别把身子急坏了！”
    娘　不、不！你们大伙儿别拦我，我不说出来心里蹩的慌！二混，你忘了谁借钱给你娶的媳妇啦？……七岁上死了你爹，这十一年的工夫，你娘寡妇事业少人没手的，奶活你这么大，要不是解放了，厂里借给钱，你这辈子还娶起媳妇了？国民党在的时候，谁看得起咱们娘们了？………
    郑、组、管　行啦，行啦，张大娘不要伤心啦，你也往宽处想吧，让他自个儿想想。
    娘　（更激奋的大声嚷）厂里治好了你娘的病，厂里借钱给你娶了媳妇。帮你成了家，立了业，这会儿工厂就是你的家，你家就是工厂，你又来偷厂里的东西，你个败家子，你个忘恩负义的东西！………
    混　（感动，低头抹泪。）………
    组　消消气吧，张大娘！
    管　二混，你把你娘气成这样还不说实话！
    郑　这是你改过的机会，说实话吧！
    混　（羞惭底语）我错啦？
    （女工甲乙丙上）
    甲乙丙　你们嚷什么啦？嚷什么啦？
    管　（对女工）你们不要吵，先听着！
    娘　（严厉的）说，你偷了几回啦？
    混　两回啦！
    娘　上回偷的什么？
    混　油！
    娘　把油弄哪去了？
    混　卖啦！
    娘　卖那钱哪？
    混　下了饭馆，看了戏啦。
    娘　好个没良心的，你的心让狗吃啦？让狼掏啦？
    女工甲乙丙　（惊异，气愤的）“好家伙二混偷东西啦！”“闹了半天是二混偷油啦！”
    管　不要乱嚷！
    三　（冷言冷语的）怪不得二混知道锭子油是十九万八千五一斤哪，闹了半天，你早偷过一回啦！
    组　（制止三）少说废话！
    女工甲　偷东西破坏大伙儿的名誉，开除他！
    乙　罚他，这锭子油这么缺，他还偷！
    丙　停止他工作，他是踢咱们大伙儿的饭碗哪！（众仍嚷）
    组　你们不要乱嚷啦，咱们有办法。
    娘（擦着眼泪）管理员，组长，有厂规摆在那儿，你们该怎么处罚他就怎么好，反正我把他交给厂里啦。
    管　你们大家不要乱嚷，厂里自有办法；张大娘，你也不要难过。……你们还记得吧，厂里开工那天，厂长就给大家讲过，现在解放啦，工人地位提高啦！大家要自觉的遵守纪律。大家要老老实实的两只手干活，不要用三只手去偷偷摸摸，也不要一只手工作，那只手歇着。到现在几个月的工夫，大家都做得很好，就是二混一个人因为不觉悟，好吃好喝偷东西，这是破坏大家的利益，现在我们按照大家规定的劳动纪律，给他一定的处分。但是我们还要认清一个问题，二混这种偷盗的罪恶是旧社会遗留下来的，旧社会和四大家族那些反动的资本家，他们剥削得我们吃不饱饭，所以许多人都要偷他，那时候的偷盗、怠工，就是我们的斗争。但是我们今天不一样了，今天的公营工厂就是我们的家，我们就是工厂的主人，所以我们就不应再有过去那种旧习气了。这种旧习气的改造，不是二混一个人的问题，也不能把开除二混来了事、二混在今天还是我们无产阶级的一员，他虽是有这种坏作风，但他对阶级敌人的压迫还是记得的。我们今天给他的处分，是为了给他一个教育。郑义同志的转变是我们工人中间的好榜样。我们应当争取二混向他学习。同时希望大家一齐注意，以后不要再发生这样事情……
    郑　（严肃的插言）我们也反对三不管这样的、认不清别人偷厂里的东西就是破坏自己的利益，怕得罪人不报告！
    众　对，反对偷东西，反对三只手！反对三不管！
    　　　　　（幕落）
