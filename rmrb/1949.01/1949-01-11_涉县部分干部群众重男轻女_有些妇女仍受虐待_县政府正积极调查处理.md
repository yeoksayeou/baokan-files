[Taihang Telegraph] The She County Women's Federation reported: Recently in She County, 53 cases of infringement upon women's human rights, property rights, and political rights have occurred. Except for six cases that have been handled or are being handled by the government, the rest urgently need investigation and resolution. Investigations have revealed the following: eight cases of women committing suicide by jumping into wells, ponds, or hanging themselves due to discord between husband and wife, oppression by in-laws, or men; four cases of rape; one case of a mother-in-law and elder brother-in-law frequently beating and scolding a woman; one case of forced marriage; one case of a woman elected as a people's congress representative being beaten by her husband to prevent her from attending the meeting; and one case of a woman who was originally from a family that was struggled against, now divorced from her husband, with the county and district government not allowing her to take her child or property after the divorce, leading to her mental breakdown.

The main reasons for these incidents are: some district and village cadres and people still hold seriously feudal views that favor sons over daughters, not treating women as human beings, thinking that it doesn't matter if a woman dies or is beaten a few times. For example, in October, when the village chief of Nanzhai Village, Duan Changshun, and the production director, etc., were mediating a dispute between Duan Guicheng's wife and her father-in-law, the father-in-law said that his daughter-in-law was wasteful in her daily life (in reality, he was trying to rape her, and she refused). The village chief and production director kicked and beat her, forcing her to admit her mistake. The next day, they tied her up at the village office, hung her up, and continued to force her to confess, forbidding her from staying at her parents' home unless approved by the village. Although injured, she still had to work every day after returning home. Half a month later, the woman finally had the opportunity to appeal to the government. The government has sentenced the village chief and production director to five months in prison for illegally beating, hanging, and mistreating the woman, and issued a circular to educate the entire county. Shi Bating, a demobilized soldier from Zhuangshang, District One, frequently beat and scolded his wife after getting married this year. The woman had repeatedly asked the government for a divorce, but the government always advised her to go back, because it was not easy for a demobilized soldier like Shi to find a wife. This November, the woman was elected as a people's congress representative, and her husband became even more dissatisfied, either refusing to open the door when she returned from the meeting or severely beating her. Helpless, the woman appealed to the county government again. On her way home, she ran into Shi Bating, who knocked out six of her teeth. She was escorted to the county government by cadres from Henan Dian Village and was finally granted a divorce. Shi Bating has been handed over to the county government for processing. Guo Louze, a demobilized soldier from Yaoze Village, District Four, married a woman from a family that was struggled against. Their relationship was not good, and they divorced this summer. The woman asked for a portion of the property and to take her child with her, but the county and district government considered her family to have been struggled against (what exactly is her class status? Regardless of her class status, it is appropriate for her to request property to maintain her life – Editor). They refused to allow her to take the property or the child. The woman became mentally deranged because she could not take her child back. The case is now being prepared for reconsideration.

The above are just some examples from the fifty-plus cases. According to statistics from District One, the district office handled fifty cases in the past six months alone. Currently, the county Women's Federation is working with the government to investigate and handle these cases to truly protect women's human rights and property rights and strive for complete liberation.

### 涉县部分干部群众重男轻女　有些妇女仍受虐待　县政府正积极调查处理

　　涉县部分干部群众重男轻女
  　有些妇女仍受虐待
  　县政府正积极调查处理
    【太行电】涉县妇联会报导：涉县最近发生了侵犯妇女人权、财权、政治权利等案件共五十三件，除六件已经政府处理或正在处理外，其余均急待调查解决。经调查清楚者，计：因夫妇关系不和、公婆、男人压迫，跳井、跳池、上吊而死的共八件，强奸的四件，婆婆、大伯经常打骂的一件，强迫结婚的一件，选为人代会代表、男人拷打不让开会的一件，原为被斗户现在与男人离婚、经县区政府处理不让带孩子、财产，神经失常者一件。
    以上这些事情发生的原因主要是：部分区村干部及群众中，还存在着相当严重的重男轻女的封建观点，不把妇女当作人看待，认为死一个妇女、打两下，没关系。如在十月份南寨村村长段长顺及生产主任等，调解段贵成媳妇与公公纠纷时，公公说是媳妇过日子浪费（实际是公公强奸不从），村长、生产主任就又踢又打，让其认错，第二天又捆到村公所，加以吊打，继续逼其承认，并迫其不准住娘家，如住娘家必须村上批准。回家后虽然带伤，还得每日劳动。半月后该妇女才得到到政府申冤的机会。政府已将该村村长、生产主任非法打人吊人与虐待妇女的行为判处了五个月徒刑，并出通报教育全县。一区庄上荣退军人史白亭今年结婚后，即经常打骂女人，该女人曾数次到政府请求离婚，但政府因史是荣退军人找个女人不容易，总是劝说回去。今年十一月该妇女被选为人代会代表，男人更加不满，开会回去不是不开门，便是毒打。女人无奈，又到县府申诉，于回家半路上碰上史白亭，史又将该女人牙齿打落六个。经河南店村干部保送到县府才得离婚。现已将史白亭送交县府处理。四区窑则村荣退军人郭楼则，与被斗户女人结婚后，感情不睦，今夏离了婚，女人要求分一部财产和带走自己的孩子，但县区政府处理，都认为是被斗户（到底是什么成份？不管其成份如何，提出要求维持生活的财产，是应该的——编者），财产孩子均不让带，该女人因带不回自己孩子，气的神经失常，现正准备重新处理。
    以上仅是五十多件中的一些例子。据一区统计，去年半年经区公所处理的即有五十件。现该县妇联会正协同政府调查处理，以确实保障妇女的人权、财权，求得彻底解放。
