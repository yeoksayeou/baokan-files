　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 29th - To facilitate people's lawsuits and fully protect people's rights, the North China People's Government recently issued a circular to its subordinates to abolish the habit of paying litigation fees and the system that litigation must be introduced by district and village governments. The circular stipulates that henceforth, all disputes among the people should be mediated by the district and village if possible. If mediation fails, the parties are free to file a lawsuit with the county judicial organ, or directly file a lawsuit with the county judicial organ without mediation. County judicial organs must accept all lawsuits filed.
　　The North China People's Government issued this order because the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region had regulations on paying litigation fees when suing. Some counties have already stopped implementing it, and now it has been decided to abolish it altogether. As for disputes among the people, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, various localities emphasized the method of mediation by district and village governments. First, the district and village governments would mediate, and if the mediation failed, the district or village government would introduce the case to the county judicial organ for resolution. This method had some success, but later, some district and village cadres, driven by personal emotions, often refused to write letters of introduction for those who did not accept mediation. Some county judicial organs also refused to accept lawsuits without a letter of introduction from the district or village, making it impossible to clarify right and wrong in some disputes, affecting the unity of the people. Abolishing this system is conducive to fully protecting the rights of the people.

### 华北政府通令所属　取消讼费及诉讼介绍制

　　华北政府通令所属
  　取消讼费及诉讼介绍制
    【新华社华北二十九日电】为便利人民诉讼，充分保障人民权利，华北人民政府顷通令所属，取消讼费及诉讼须经区村政府介绍的习惯制度。通令规定今后人民之间一切纠纷在区村能调解者调解之，不能调解者，任凭当事人到县司法机关起诉讼或不经调解直接向县司法机关起诉。县司法机关对于一切起诉者都必须受理。
    华北人民政府这个命令的发布，是因为前晋察冀边区曾有诉讼时交讼费的规定。现在有的县早已不执行了，现在决定一律取消。至于人民中间的纠纷，在抗日战争期间，各地曾着重采用区村政府调解的办法，先经区村政府调解，如果调解不成，才由区或村政府介绍到县司法机关解决。这一办法有它一定的成功，但后来有的区村干部激于个人意气，往往不给不服调解者写介绍信，而有些县的司法机关，也就拒绝受理没有区村介绍信的诉讼，使得有些纠纷，是非不能辩明，影响人民团结。取消这个制度，便于充分保护人民的权利。
