　　Yicheng Organizes Horse Trading Cooperative, Bringing Back Thirty Mares

　　[Taiyue News] In order to improve agricultural production and solve the shortage of draught animals, the Yicheng County Federation of Cooperatives organized a horse trading cooperative in Xiwang Village, Fourth District, last November. Under the specific guidance of Xu Baolin, the District Head of the Fourth District, and cadres from the County Federation of Cooperatives, regulations were established regarding free share purchase and withdrawal, democratic management, and periodic dividend distribution. The cooperative policy was promoted to mobilize the masses to jointly trade livestock. At that time, four households lacking livestock joined the cooperative, which later expanded to eleven households, with a total investment of 50,000 yuan (new currency). The County Federation of Cooperatives also invested 10,000 yuan from within the organization, and obtained a loan of 50,000 yuan from the bank, totaling 110,000 yuan in shares. People with experience in livestock trading and connections in the horse-producing areas were selected to lead the team to trade horses in Hongdong, Lyuliang area. Within a month, they made two trips and brought back thirty mares. Except for four mares (pregnant mares) retained in the village for adjustment, all were sold to households lacking livestock in neighboring villages. After two round trips, the bank loan was repaid and a profit of 20,500 yuan was earned. The cooperative members were very happy, as they both adjusted the livestock supply and earned dividends. The village cooperative is now planning to expand its capital and continue to trade horses in large quantities in areas such as Yulin.

　　翼城组织贩马合作社贩回母马三十匹
    【太岳讯】翼城县联社为了搞好农业生产，解决耕畜困难，特于去年十一月在四区西王村组织了一个贩马合作社。在该区区长续保林与县联社干部具体指导下，定出入股、退股自由，民主管理，按期分红等制度。并宣传了合作政策，动员群众合伙贩买牲畜。当时有四家缺牲畜户集股，后又扩大到十一家，股金五万元（新币下同）。县联社并从社内投资一万元，银行贷款五万元共股金十一万元。选择有贩牲畜经验并与出马地有关系的人带领，往吕梁区洪洞一带贩马。一个月内走了两趟，贩回母马三十匹。除该村留下调剂母马（带肚马）四匹外，都卖给了邻村缺牲畜户。二次往返即还清了银行贷款并赚洋二万零五百元。既调剂了牲畜又赚到红利，社员都很高兴。现该村合作社正计划扩大股金，续往榆林等地大量贩马。
