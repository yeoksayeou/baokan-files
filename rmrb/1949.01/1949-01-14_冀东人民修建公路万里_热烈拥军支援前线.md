Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Tianjin and Beijing, 12th. The work of the Jidong District in supporting the Tianjin-Beijing front lines has achieved great results due to the tireless and active efforts of the people and Party, government, and military workers throughout the district. To guarantee military food supplies, thorough mobilization was carried out in various places before the autumn grain collection last year, in connection with the victorious situation. When the news of the Northeast Army entering the customs arrived, various places immediately launched a campaign to rush grain collection and delivery. Most of the cadres of various organs were dispatched. In some villages, Party members took the lead in handing over good grain, such as Communist Party member He Ruihua of the 600-household village in Yutian County, who ate bad rice at home but handed over good rice as public grain. In other villages, people worked in the fields during the day and milled rice at night, with women carrying bags to hand over public grain. Countless grain depots and soybean supply stations were set up along the roads where the troops passed, concentrating millions of pounds of grain, firewood, oil, and salt. Regarding road construction and bridge building, nearly ten thousand miles of highway trunk and branch lines in Jidong have been cleared, thanks to the active repairs by the people of Jidong over several months. At the same time, more than 280 large and small bridges were built, and many dangerous sections such as Haorling and Xuanwuling were re-widened and leveled. Parallel roads were built on the most dangerous roads. All roads were expanded to 36 feet wide to avoid traffic congestion. A large number of cadres from the Jidong Administrative Office's Transportation Bureau and governments at all levels went deep into districts and villages to personally mobilize the masses for emergency repairs. The masses worked day and night regardless of fatigue, and many women, children, and elderly people actively participated. When building bridges, without pile drivers, workers jumped into the icy water and used stones to drive piles. When rushing to repair two bridge piers of the Longhan Factory River Bridge, workers persisted in their work despite enemy aircraft bombing and strafing. After the Northeast People's Liberation Army entered the customs, various places organized follow-up repair teams to build bridges and repair roads, allowing the main force to advance smoothly into Tianjin and Beijing. Regarding transportation and stretcher work, before the arrival of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, most of the stretchers and carts in various counties had been organized. The method of going out for war service was: each village democratically assessed the personnel responsible for war service based on age and physical condition, and then voluntarily formed groups. Each village formed several groups, and war service tasks were carried out by the groups in rotation. In this way, while supporting the front, families could continue production. After a certain sub-district held a war preparedness meeting, it completed the compilation of all forward stretchers in less than 20 days. Yutian County gathered more than 2,900 stretchers in just a few days. After the stretchers were assembled in various places, they were inspected and trained separately to make thorough preparations. Many village stretchers were equipped with two quilts and a small ladle (to collect urine for the wounded), and each stretcher bearer prepared two pairs of shoes and socks. Currently, more than 6,900 stretchers from the Jidong District have gone out with the army, and the rest are actively preparing to depart. The stretcher bearers are in high spirits, and in the Shunyi stretcher regiment, only three patients dropped out during the half-month march. Regarding support-the-army work, when the Northeast Field Army poured into the customs, the people of Jidong immediately vacated houses, heated up kang beds, erected arches, and performed Yangko dances to welcome them. Women's federations in various counties, districts, and villages organized sewing and washing groups and comfort groups, actively making military uniforms, military shoes, quilt covers, tobacco pouches, and other items to comfort the army. At the same time, a movement to cherish the wounded was launched. The women of Fengrun South have already made many military uniforms, coats, bedding, and other clothing items, and raised several kinds of food such as eggs and white sugar, as well as more than four million border currency to send to the troops. The people of Baodi sewed more than 10,000 pairs of cloth socks overnight. During the New Year, people in various places launched a New Year's support-the-army upsurge. The first batch of support-the-army pork reached 1,006,100 catties, and 6,000 boxes of cigarettes, all of which have been sent to the front-line troops. The reason why the Jidong District's support-the-front work was done relatively well this time is that preparations were made in advance. As early as September last year, the Jidong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged cadre meeting of the entire district to discuss and deploy the task of preparing to support the front lines. After that, the vast people of Jidong were mobilized, producing on the one hand and preparing to support the war on the other. Therefore, when the Northeast People's Liberation Army entered the customs, it was able to receive timely and great help from the people.

[Jidong Telegram] The masses in the Jidong New District enthusiastically launched a support-the-army movement. Because the Beitang area is close to the front lines and has suffered greatly from the Kuomintang bandits, immediately after liberation, all the town's fishermen, merchants, and others vacated houses, boiled water, acted as guides, repaired bridges, and repaired roads, using various ferry boats to welcome and comfort the People's Liberation Army. The people actively transported grass and grain to the People's Liberation Army. Some people were so busy that they didn't even have time to eat. More than 20 carpenters worked for our army, making things both meticulously and sturdily. The town also organized 40 stretchers, and each member has the confidence to complete the task and is full of energy. Merchants such as Hexing, Yichanglong, and Baochunpu and other warehouses automatically donated 22,885 catties of bean cake stored earlier to support the front, as horse feed. Women also actively helped the People's Liberation Army to disassemble, wash, sew, and mend clothes and socks. According to incomplete statistics, more than 460 boatmen and more than 3,700 people participated in the support-the-front service in the town in just five days. The masses in the second district of Linyu were grateful for our army's liberation and offered meat one after another. Just 17 villages offered 6,030 catties of pork to comfort the army.

　　冀东人民修建公路万里
  　热烈拥军支援前线
    【新华社平津前线十二日电】冀东区支援平津前线的工作，在全区人民及党政军工作者日夜辛劳积极努力之下，获得巨大成绩。在保证军食方面，在去年秋征前，各地即联系着胜利的形势，进行了深入动员，等到东北军进关的消息传来时，各地立即展开了突击征粮、送粮工作，各机关干部大部出动。有的村庄党员带头缴好粮。如玉田县六百户村共产党员贺瑞华自己家里吃的是坏米，缴公粮的是好米。还有的村子，白天出工，晚上碾米，妇女背着口袋缴公粮。在部队经过的路上，沿途设立了无数的粮库与大豆供应站，集中了千百万斤的粮食、柴草油盐。在修路架桥方面，冀东境内近万里的公路干线支线，在冀东人民数月的积极抢修下，均告畅通。同时并架设大小桥梁二百八十余座，许多险工如好儿岭、玄武岭等处都重新加以炸宽修平；在最险要的道路上，都修着平行公路。所有公路都扩展为三丈六尺宽，以免汽车拥挤走不开。冀东行署交通局及各级政府的大批干部，都深入区村亲自发动群众，紧急抢修。各地群众不顾疲劳，日夜工作，许多妇女儿童和老年人也踊跃参加。架桥时，没有千斤打桩，工人就跳在冰冷的水里用石头打。抢修龙汉厂＠河桥两座桥桩时，工人们冒着敌机的轰炸扫射，坚持工作。东北解放军进关后，各地又组织了随军抢修队，架桥修路，使大军顺利挺进平津。在运输及担架工作方面，在东北解放军到来前，各县的担架大车已大部组编就绪。出战争勤务的办法是：由各村根据年龄与身体条件，民主评出负担战勤人员，然后再自愿结合成组，每村编成几个组，战勤任务由几个组轮流出。这样，一面支前，家中还可继续生产。某分区在召开备战大会后，不到二十天便把全部前方担架编成。玉田县仅在几天中，就集合起两千九百余付担架。各地担架集合后，都分别进行检阅与训练，作了周密的准备。许多村里的担架都准备了两床被褥，一个小瓢（准备给伤员接尿用），每个担架队员都准备了两只鞋袜。现冀东区已有六千九百余付担架随军出征，其余亦正在积极准备出发。担架队员们情绪高涨，顺义担架团在半个月的行军中，只有三个病号掉队。劳军工作方面，当东北野战军源源进关后，冀东人民当即腾房子、烧热炕、扎牌楼、闹秧歌来欢迎，各个县区村的妇女会都组织起缝洗组、慰问组，积极赶做军装、军鞋、被套、烟口袋等物品慰问军队，同时展开了爱护伤员的运动。丰（润）南妇女已做好军装、大衣、被褥等衣物多件，筹集鸡蛋、白糖等食物数种及边币四百多万元送给部队。宝坻人民则连夜赶缝布袜万余双。阳历年关，各地人民又掀起新年劳军热潮，第一批劳军猪肉已达一百万零六千一百斤，香烟六千盒，都已送到前方各部队。这次冀东区支援前线工作所以做得比较好，其原因之一是预先有准备。早在去年九月，中共冀东区党委便召开全区扩大干部会议，便讨论和布置了准备支援前线的任务。其后，冀东广大人民便动员起来，一面生产，一面准备支援战争。因此，在东北解放军入关时，能及时得到人民的巨大帮助。
    【冀东电】冀东新区群众，热烈展开拥军支前。因北塘地区接近前线，又饱受蒋匪蹂躏，所以刚解放后，全镇渔民、商号等就纷纷腾房、烧水、作向导、修桥、修路，用各种摆渡船只，迎接与慰劳解放军。人民积极给解放军运草、运粮。有的群众忙得一天不顾吃饭，有二十余木匠工人给我军做活，既细致又结实。该镇并组织了四十付担架，各个队员都有完成任务信心，精神饱满；商号合兴、义昌隆、保春浦等货栈自动献出早存的豆饼两万二千八百八十五斤支前，作为马料；妇女也积极帮助解放军拆洗缝补衣袜；据不完全统计：全镇在五天中就有四百六十余个船工，三千七百余人参加了支前勤务。临榆二区群众感激我军解放纷纷献肉，只十七个村就献出六千零三十斤猪肉劳军。
