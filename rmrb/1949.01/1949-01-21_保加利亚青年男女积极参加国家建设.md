Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 14th: TASS, Sofia, January 10th: Approximately 260,000 young men and women are now voluntarily participating in Bulgaria's fundamental construction work. Two years ago, Bulgaria formed its first youth work team. Their first large-scale victory was the completion of a highway through the Hainboaz Pass, connecting the north and south of Bulgaria with the shortest route. The success of this work team strengthened the confidence of Bulgarian youth in their own strength. In 1947, under the initiative of the Central Committee of the Democratic Youth League, a national construction work team of 85,000 people was spontaneously formed in a short period. In that year, Bulgarian youth completed several basic construction projects for the country, including the 52-kilometer new railway from Sofia via Vuyak to Benak (western Bulgaria), and the 155-kilometer electrified railway from Kurilo to Plovdiv (central Bulgaria). In 1948, 250,000 young volunteers began constructing new power stations, canals, reservoirs, tunnels, highways, railways, etc. At the end of 1948, the national youth team completed the railway from Lovech to Troyan (both in northern Bulgaria) ahead of schedule. Last year, local work teams did a great deal of work. They built dozens of miles of new roads, built several machine and tractor stations, schools, clubs, sports fields, and installed power lines in several villages, etc. According to government estimates, the work done by national and local work teams in 1948 was worth a total of 1.5 billion Bulgarian levs. In the past year, approximately one thousand young workers and students from Belgium, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Britain, Italy, France, Hungary, Switzerland, Albania, and other countries joined hands with Bulgarian youth in participating in Bulgaria's construction work.

　　保加利亚青年男女积极参加国家建设
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社索非亚十日讯：约有二十六万青年男女现正自动参加保加利亚国家的基本建设工作。在两年以前，保国就已组成了第一个青年工作队。他们第一个大规模的胜利，就是他们完成了横经海恩包茨基关隘的一条公路，把保国的北部与南部用一条最短捷的道路连接起来。该工作队的成功，加强了保国青年对他们自己的力量的信心。一九四七年，在民主青年联盟中央委员会的发起下，自动地组成了一个在短期间数达八万五千人的国家建设工作队。在这一年，保国青年为国家完成了若干基本的建设工程，其中有从索非亚经伏乌雅克到贝纳克（保西部）的五十二公里的新铁路，和自库利洛到普罗夫迪夫（保中部）一百五十五公里的电气化铁路等。一九四八年，有二十五万青年志愿队员开始建筑新的电力站、运河、蓄水池、隧道、公路、铁路等。一九四八年末，国家青年队提前完成了洛维奇——特罗詹（俱在保北部）的铁路。去年各地方工作队做了许许多多的工作。他们建筑了几十英里的新公路，建筑了若干机器与拖拉机站、学校、俱乐部、运动场，并在若干村庄架设电线等。据政府估计，国家与地方工作队一九四八年所作的工作，共值十五亿保币。去年一年间，约有一千名来自比、奥、波、捷、丹、英、意、法、匈、瑞士、阿尔巴尼亚及其他国家的青年工人和学生们，与保国青年肩并肩地参加保国的建设工作。
