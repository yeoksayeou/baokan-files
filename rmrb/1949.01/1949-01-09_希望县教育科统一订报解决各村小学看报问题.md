　　Hoping the County Education Section will Unify Newspaper Subscriptions to Solve the Problem of Newspaper Reading in Village Primary Schools
　　Editor:
　　Within this year's agricultural tax grain storage, the teachers' full-year salaries have already been统筹统支 (unified planning and unified distribution) by the county. However, the expenses for lamp oil, newspaper subscriptions, paper, pens, etc., for village schools and village public offices cannot exceed twenty-five jin of rice per month. According to feedback from some village teachers in Zuoquan, they are suffering from the distress of not being able to read newspapers. Because some villages are afraid that the expenses will be insufficient, they do not subscribe to newspapers for the teachers. As a result, the number of newspaper subscriptions in Zuoquan in November and December decreased by more than one-third. My personal opinion is that it would be best if the education section of each county would be responsible for uniformly subscribing to newspapers each month. The county could deduct the newspaper fees from the expenses of each village, and the post office could collect the money uniformly and submit it to the newspaper office on time. Only in this way can the problem of teachers reading newspapers be solved.

　　希望县教育科统一订报解决各村小学看报问题
    编辑同志：
    今年的农业税屯粮内，已经把教员全年的薪金由县统筹统支，但各村学校、村公所的灯油、订报、纸、笔等的开支每月不能超过二十五斤米，据左权有些村教员同志反映，有看不到报纸的苦闷，因为有的村怕开支不够，就不给教员订报了，因此左权十一月份与十二月份的订报数量，即减少三分之一以上。我个人意见，最好由各县教育科每月负责统一订报，县里从各村开支内统一扣除报费，邮局也能统一收款，按期送交报社，只有这样，才能解决教员看报的问题。
