　　【Shijiazhuang News】The Electric Company's month-long production competition, in addition to exceeding and completing the original plan, the main gain was the unity and mutual assistance of employees in their work, demonstrating an increase in class consciousness. The most prominent was the technical department. In the past, some people were in opposition to each other, and some people were watching from the sidelines. On the surface, they seemed harmonious, but behind their backs, they harbored grievances. Since the start of the competition, they have conducted concrete discussions based on the plans they proposed, and allocated work. In the process of work, they also paid attention to mutual cooperation. As a result, the monthly work efficiency was more than two and a half times higher than before the competition. In the past, the accounting department had to delay the monthly accounts until the beginning of the next month to complete them. Now, not only have they completed the backlog of accounts, but they also guarantee that the monthly accounts will not be delayed. After completing their own tasks, the cashiers also took the initiative to help with bookkeeping. The materials department completed the half-month warehouse reorganization plan in only twelve days, and also changed the phenomenon of discrepancies between accounts and inventory. The business department not only exceeded the estimated amount of collections, but also completed the plan two days ahead of schedule. When workers in the power supply department were installing a certain line, it was estimated that it would take fifty workers, but it was completed with only thirty workers. General work efficiency increased by one to two times. Before the company prepared for war, some employees were late, left early, or even simply did not come to work, pretended to be sick, and asked for leave. After the competition, this phenomenon has completely changed. Some comrades moved into the company at night to sleep in order to catch up on work. The idea of egalitarianism has also undergone many changes. In this award evaluation, everyone had a serious discussion. Finally, after the evaluation committee decided to give the award banner given by Comrade Liu Xiufeng of the Municipal Party Committee to the technical department. Nine people won special prizes, each with 100 catties of millet. Twenty-four first prizes, each with 81 catties of millet. There were also second and third prizes, each with 60 catties and 40 catties of millet respectively. The awards were issued on the 31st of the year.

　　石市电灯公司竞赛主要收获
  　增强职工团结互助
　　工作效率超过竞赛前两倍半
    【石家庄讯】电灯公司一个月的生产竞赛，除超过并完成了原计划以外，主要的收获是职工在工作中的团结互助，表现了阶级觉悟的提高。最特出的是技术室，过去有一部分人是互相对立，一部分人在旁观望，表面上一团和气，背地里互有怨言，自从竞赛开始以后，他们根据自己所提出的计划，具体进行了讨论，分配了工作，在工作进行中，又注意互相配合，结果一个月的工作效率，比竞赛前超过了二倍半。会计科过去每个月的帐目，都得拖到下月初才能完成，现在，不但完成了积压下来的帐目，而且保证了每月帐目不拖延。现金出纳的同志在完成自己任务以后，还主动的去帮助记帐。材料科半个月的整库计划，只用了十二天就完成了，而且也改变了帐目与库存不符的现象。营业科不仅超过了预计的收款数目，还提前两天完成了计划。供电科工人在按设某线路时，预计五十个工，只用了三十个工就完成了。一般的工作效率，增加了一倍到两倍。公司在备战前，有的职工迟到早退，甚至随便不到，装病请假。竞赛以后，这种现象已经完全改变。有的同志为了赶工作，晚上搬到公司里面来睡。平均主义的思想，也有了不少转变。在这次评奖中，大家都作了慎重的讨论，最后经评委决定把市委刘秀峰同志奖给的一面奖旗给了技术室。有九个人得了特等奖，每人小米一百斤。二十四名一等奖，每人小米八十一斤。其他尚有二等三等，各奖小米六十斤、四十斤。这次奖励已于年前三十一号发出。
