　　Celebrating Victory, Celebrating Our Own Liberation!
  　Shijiazhuang Celebrates the New Year with Joy.
    Workers Show Particular Enthusiasm and Happiness
    [Shijiazhuang News] As our Northeast and North China armies victoriously join forces and North China is about to be completely liberated, all sectors of the city are celebrating the New Year of 1949 with great excitement and joy. Government offices, factories, and schools have erected verdant and lush colorful arches, adorned with prominent five-pointed red stars, couplets, and various colored flowers. Red flags fluttered in the streets and alleys. The day before yesterday morning, government offices and worker groups held New Year gatherings with each other, and cadres from each district and street visited the families of military personnel to offer New Year greetings. Each military family received a New Year card from the municipal government. Over forty Yangko dance troupes—several with more than a hundred people—along with stilt walkers, martial arts performers, lion dancers, and other performances, filled the streets with the sounds of drums and gongs. Citizens poured into the streets from all directions, surrounding these Yangko troupes. Watching them perform various exciting programs, windows were crowded with faces, and playful children climbed onto the trees on the sidewalks. Military bands marched neatly through the center of the streets, carrying a banner in front that read "Celebrating the New Year, Offering New Year Greetings to All Military Personnel, Civilians, and Military Families." Behind them flowed a tide of people.
    The People's Education Center held photo, New Year picture, and wall newspaper exhibitions, with viewers squeezing in and out of the entrance.
    In the evening, the lights were brilliant. Zhonghua Road, where the municipal government was located, was even brighter than other places due to the proximity of the electric company, the trade union federation, and the telephone bureau. Yangko troupes unfolded large-scale dances on this wide street. The Yangko troupe from the Prosperity Factory was the most outstanding. These male and female workers from the cotton mill—all wearing white aprons, some with red stars, others holding up model flags—shone like white flowers fluttering and spinning under the light of lamps and torches. The audience, packed around them like an iron barrel, cheered them amidst the loud drums and gongs.
    Underneath each loudspeaker, a large crowd of listeners carefully listened to the Xinhua News Agency editorial "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." They listened so attentively that even the gongs and drums of the Yangko troupes and the laughter of some viewers could not distract them.
    Trade unions in each district held New Year gatherings in their respective districts, followed by discussion sessions where workers spontaneously spoke their minds. Xu Zhenshan, a member of a bathhouse workers' union in the first district, said: "In the past, without the leadership of the Communist Party, and without organizations, we suffered unreasonable oppression and exploitation. The boss could fire an apprentice whenever he didn't like him, without any reason. Now we have a trade union, our own organization, which has solved many problems beneficial to workers. Any unreasonable issues can be raised for correction." At the workers' symposium in the third district, in-depth discussions were held on wages and worker welfare issues. Workers criticized the government, saying, "There is too little contact with workers, and problems are not resolved in a timely manner."
    The railway bureau's employees held a joint party in the auditorium, welcoming representatives returning from the Sixth Labor Congress in the Northeast. They said they were very happy to have traveled around the Northeast on the "Mao Zedong" train, and they deeply appreciated the greatness of the Northeast's resources and industrial construction. They were very impressed by the diligence of the workers in the Northeast. One representative said, "Workers of the world are one family."
    Another evening party was organized at the Qiaodong Art Theater—a gathering of all the students from the Student Union. Each school performed its own program. No. 1 Middle School performed "The Transformation of Comrade Zhao Yujie," which, although not a mature work, was a true and vivid story, welcomed by the students. The Girls' Middle School's Yangko dance was also very impressive. (Shijiazhuang Daily)

　　庆祝胜利，庆祝自己解放！
  　石家庄各界欢度新岁
    工人们特别表现活跃快乐
    【石家庄讯】在我东北华北大军胜利会师、华北即将全部解放的时候，本市各界怀着非常兴奋和愉快的心情来庆祝一九四九年的元旦。各机关、工厂、学校都札起青青郁郁的彩牌坊，衬上显目的五角红星、对联和各种颜色的花朵；大街小巷红旗飘扬，前日晨机关和工人团体相互举行团拜，各区街干部分别向军人家属拜年，每家的军属都收到了市政府的贺年片。四十余起的秧歌队——其中有百人以上的好几起，还有高跷、武术、跳狮子等玩艺，锣鼓喧天，纷纷到街头演出。市民从四面八方涌到街心，把这些秧歌队团团围住；看他们表演各种精彩的节目，楼窗上挤满了人头，顽皮的小朋友们爬到行人道上的树上，军乐队整齐的步伐穿过了街心，在他们前面高挑着“庆祝新年向全市军民军属团拜”的旗帜；他们的后面潮水的人群在流动着。
    民教馆在举行照片、年画和墙报展览，观众们从那门口挤进挤出。
    入晚，灯火辉煌，市政府所在地的中华路上由于电灯公司、总工会和电话局几家机关相邻，灯火更比别处明亮。秧歌队就在这条宽广的街面上，展开了大规模舞蹈。繁荣厂的秧歌队最出色，他们——这些纱厂男女工人们一色的白围裙，有的挂着红星，有的高举着模范旗子，在灯光和火把的照耀下，象白的花朵在翻飞，在旋转，铁桶般围着他们的观众，在紧锣大鼓的声中向他们欢呼。
    每处的广播器下面，都拥有着一大堆听众，在听取新华社社论“将革命进行到底”的广播，他们是那样细心的听，连秧歌队的锣鼓和一些观众的喧笑也不能分散他们的注意。
    各区工会分别在各区举行团拜，在团拜后并举行座谈会，工人们都自动地讲出了自己要说的话。在一区一个沐浴工会的会员许振山说：“过去咱们没有共产党的领导，也没有组织，受着不合理的压迫、剥削；掌柜的看着徒弟不顺眼，说不要就不要了，也没有理由，现在有了工会，有了咱们自己的组织，解决了许多对工人有利益的问题，有什么不合理的事，都可以提出改正。”在三区的工人座谈会上，对工资和工人福利的问题作了深入的讨论，工人给政府提出了批评说：“和工人联系的少，解决问题不及时。”
    铁路局的职工们在大礼堂举行联欢晚会，并欢迎从东北回来的出席第六次劳动大会的代表。他们说：他们非常高兴地坐着“毛泽东号”的火车在东北到处参观，他们深感东北的资源和工业建设的伟大，他们对东北的工人努力的情形非常敬佩。一个代表说：“天下工人是一家”。
    在桥东的艺术剧院组成了另一个晚会——学联会的全体同学联欢，每个学校都演出了自已的节目，一中演的是同学们自己创造的“赵玉杰同学的转变”，这个剧虽然不能说是成熟的作品，但故事是真实的、生动的，受到同学们的欢迎；女中的秧歌舞也很精彩。　（石家庄日报）
