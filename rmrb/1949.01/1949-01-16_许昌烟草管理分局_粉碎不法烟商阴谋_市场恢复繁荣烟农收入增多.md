　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 11th: The Xuchang Sub-bureau of the Central Plains Tobacco Administration's tobacco management work has laid a preliminary foundation for the future development of the bureau's work after defeating the conspiracy of certain unscrupulous merchants to disrupt the tobacco leaf market. After the liberation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in November last year, Henan tobacco sales were sluggish for a time due to the plummeting of the pseudo-gold yuan and the increased foreign exchange difficulties for foreign merchants. Some illegal tobacco merchants took this opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, attempting to cause the stagnation of tobacco leaf transactions in order to resist the people's government's management of tobacco, so that they could continue to speculate and manipulate the tobacco market and illegally exploit tobacco farmers. They said: "With the establishment of the Tobacco Administration Bureau, tobacco leaves are not allowed to be exported." "Only five packs are allowed to be exported for every ten packs purchased." Some tobacco merchants said: "The commission is too small, not enough to live on." Foreign merchants felt that in order to sell tobacco leaves, they had to obtain an export license from the Administration Bureau and periodically exchange for goods of equal value, so they also asked: "What if we can't exchange the goods back when the time comes?" The above situation made the tobacco leaf market even more depressed, and the tobacco farmers were eager to sell their tobacco leaves, so some misunderstandings about tobacco management also occurred among some tobacco farmers. After analyzing the above situation, the Xuchang Tobacco Administration Sub-bureau cooperated with state-owned stores to purchase large quantities of tobacco leaves to support tobacco prices, so that tobacco farmers would not suffer losses due to the stagnation of tobacco leaf sales and the fall in tobacco prices. At the same time, general tobacco merchants were also given publicity and education, and the method of accounting was used to prove that the so-called "commission is too small, not enough to live on" and other arguments were completely false. Seeing that the people's government was resolute in its tobacco management policy and that state-owned stores were purchasing large quantities of tobacco leaves during the period of sluggish sales, the tobacco merchants requested the Administration Bureau to approve their continued operations. In the second half of November, one hundred tobacco firms were approved to continue operating. The number of tobacco leaf transactions was more than 33,100 jin on November 16th, which increased to more than 122,800 jin by the 30th. In the second half of November, a total of more than 1,538,200 jin were traded. The total value was more than 45 million Central Plains currency, and tobacco prices also gradually rebounded. Under the management of the people's government, the commission charged by tobacco firms was reduced from 6% of the transaction amount before management to 5%. In the past, the commission was entirely paid by tobacco farmers, but now it has been changed to 2/5 by the seller and 3/5 by the buyer. The tobacco firms also pay 2/5 of the commission as business tax. In the past, when tobacco firms collected tobacco from tobacco farmers, for every 100 jin purchased, the tobacco farmers had to add another 25 jin (the so-called "extra weight," calculated as 100 jin for every 125 jin). Now, this kind of "extra weight" is changed to a maximum of 15 jin per 100 jin. In the second half of November, tobacco farmers increased their income by more than 5,918,000 yuan due to the reduction of exploitation by tobacco firms in terms of commissions and "extra weight." Xuchang is one of the main tobacco-producing areas in Henan. According to statistics in 1946, the annual output of tobacco leaves in the county was more than 24,226,000 jin. It is the county's major export commodity, and there are more than 150 large and small tobacco firms in the county.

　　许昌烟草管理分局
  　粉碎不法烟商阴谋
  　市场恢复繁荣烟农收入增多
    【新华社中原十一日电】中原烟草管理局许昌分局的烟草管理工作，在击破了某些奸商企图破坏烟叶市场的阴谋之后，已经给今后该局工作的开展打下了初步基础。去年十一月郑州、开封解放以后，由于伪金圆券暴跌，外地客商外汇困难增加等原因，河南烟草一度滞销。某些不法烟商即乘此机会，多方造谣破坏，企图造成烟叶交易的停滞，以抵抗人民政府对烟草的管理，而使他们可以继续投机操纵烟市和非法剥削烟农。他们说：“成立了烟草管理局，烟叶不让出口了。”“买十包只准出五包。”有的烟行商人说：“佣金太少，不够生活。”外商觉得销出烟叶，须向管理局领取出口许可证，定期换回等价货物，所以也提出：“到期换不回货来怎么办？”上述情况，使烟叶市场更加萧条，而烟农又亟需卖出烟叶，于是在某些烟农中也发生某些对烟草管理的误解。许昌烟草管理分局在分析了上述情况后，便协同公营商店大量收购烟叶，支持烟价，使烟农免受因烟叶滞销而烟价跌落的损失。同时对一般烟商也进行了宣传教育，以算帐的办法，证明所谓“佣金太少，不够生活”等论调是完全虚伪。烟商见人民政府对烟草管理政策坚决，公营商店又在滞销期间大量收购烟叶，于是纷纷请求管理局批准他们进行营业。十一月下半月，被批准继续营业的烟行有一百家。烟叶成交数十一月十六日为三万三千一百余斤，到三十日则增为十二万二千八百余斤。半月中共成交一百五十三万八千二百余斤。总值中州币四千五百余万元，烟价也渐见回涨。烟行交易在人民政府管理下，烟行所收佣金由管理前的占成交额百分之六减为百分之五，过去佣金全部由烟农偿付，现改为卖方出五分之二，买方出五分之三。烟行并以佣金的五分之二缴纳营业税。过去烟行向烟农收烟，每收购百斤，烟农须另加二十五斤（即所谓“加磅”，以一百二十五斤按一百斤计算），现在此种“加磅”改为每百斤最多不得超过十五斤。在十一月下半月中，烟农由于在佣金及“加磅”两方面所受烟行剥削减轻，即比过去增加收入达五百九十一万八千余元。按许昌为河南主要产烟地区之一。据一九四六年统计，全县烟叶年产量为二千四百二十二万六千余斤。为该县出口大宗，全县大小烟行有一百五十余家。
