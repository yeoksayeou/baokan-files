Experiences in Road Repair in Yuanshi and Other Counties

　　I. Preparatory Work

　　Each county first established a county headquarters. County heads of Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Neiqiu, and Xingtai participated, while Lincheng was represented by a secretary. First, they inspected the extent of damage to the roadbed and estimated the labor needed for the repair project. They then placed markers along the sections. Xingtai even enlisted the help of former railway workers to assist in surveying and estimating the labor hours.

　　(1) Preparation for Organizational Work: The county headquarters in each county were quite robust. The county head, section chiefs, or secretaries, and the director of the Armed Forces Committee personally participated in the command. Organizationally, Xingtai divided into sections for organizing and mobilizing labor, technical guidance, publicity, and inspection. Yuanshi selected twenty primary school teachers to participate in publicity. The district headquarters were commanded by the district head or a strong cadre. At the village level, key cadres served as captains, who then appointed group leaders, dividing into groups (or teams), generally of ten to fifteen people. In Gaoyi and Yuanshi's Wangsong Village, militiamen were assigned to each team as leaders, playing a backbone and leading role. In addition to this, there were air defense and alert organizations. Each district selected several militiamen to serve as guards in the villages where the laborers were housed to prevent sabotage by bad elements. Every night, at a set time, one or two people were specifically responsible for blowing air raid sirens. In terms of mass air defense preparations, Lincheng and Gaoyi had people bring dark floral robes or bedsheets, which could be used as cover in case of aircraft. They also dug air raid shelters along the roadside (few people in Lincheng wore dark floral cloth, so fewer were prepared). Yuanshi's Sixth District designated eleven better cadres to form a public security team to watch out for sabotage.

　　(2) Tool Preparation: Because the leadership was unfamiliar with road repair projects and lacked experience, the tool preparation was based solely on the required tools for tamping, picking stones, and earthwork. Gaoyi, Yuanshi, and Xingtai brought more tools, which helped avoid delays. However, some villages brought too few tampers. While the earth was being filled, others had to stop and wait for the tamping to be done before they could continue filling. Lincheng knew that tampers might be in short supply, but did not make a firm decision beforehand, resulting in a general shortage of tampers. Yuanshi's Fifth District suffered greatly because they were assigned more stone-picking work but brought too few stone-picking tools, which was both time-consuming and caused delays. Although each village went back to make, borrow, or requisition tools overnight, it ultimately affected the work.

　　(3) Preparation for Logistical Work: For such a large-scale mobilization of labor, thorough preparations in logistical work are necessary to maintain the morale of the workers. In Yuanshi's Sixth District, village cadres divided the work. The head of the team was in charge of mobilizing labor, while the deputy head was in charge of logistical preparations. They were responsible for planning and preparing housing, food, furniture, firewood, vegetables, rice, and other items. In Gaoyi, each village selected a logistics manager. Each laborer brought six catties of rice, ten catties of vegetables, fifty catties of firewood, and five hundred yuan for vegetables. The logistics manager was responsible for managing expenditures and keeping accounts. Good preparations for food and lodging maintained the morale of the laborers and prevented problems from occurring.

　　(4) Preparation for Project Calculation: Initially, the county headquarters estimated the labor hours based on the extent of damage. Xingtai enlisted former railway workers to assist in surveying and estimating labor. However, the estimates were generally not realistic. Neiqiu initially estimated that the entire county would mobilize 20,000 laborers and it would take twelve days to complete. But in reality, only 19,581 people were mobilized, and the project was completed in three and a half days. The estimates in other counties were also not accurate enough. Later, comrades from the Highway Bureau took measurements. However, they did not anticipate the stone-picking work beforehand, and only measured the depth, length, and width of the soil pits, calculating the volume and labor hours. The stone-picking work between the pits was not accounted for at all. Some villages had to get soil from far away but that was not included. As a result, the estimates still did not match the actual labor hours, which wasted manpower. In Xingtai, Neiqiu, Yuanshi, and Lincheng, the initial estimates of labor hours were too low, so fewer laborers were mobilized, which resulted in heavy labor in some areas. This increased the burden and affected the morale of the laborers. This was due to the lack of thorough planning for the project beforehand. If the preliminary estimate had been more thorough, the estimation of labor hours would have been more accurate.

　　II. Specific and Clear Instructions Reduce Problems

　　The original standard for the project was simply to pick the stones clean, tamp the soil well, and maintain the original roadbed. But there were no clearer or more specific instructions, which led to problems. Lincheng's First and Second Districts used Buyao Village as the standard and organized inspection teams, enlisting veteran railway workers for inspection. Once the standard was met, the project was handed over, which resulted in a better outcome. The Third District did not implement this method, so the work was not as good (the stones were not picked clean, the tamping was not solid, and some of the old roadbed was dug up).

　　In addition, giving full play to the leadership of village cadres is very important. Because the number of county and district cadres is limited and the road sections are long, they cannot manage even if they run back and forth. According to the experience of Lincheng, Xingtai, Yuanshi, and other counties, giving full play to the command and leadership role of village cadres and team leaders is crucial to managing the laborers. Lincheng first created an experience in one village to promote to other villages, inspecting and pointing out shortcomings at the same time. Village cadres in Yuanshi's Sixth District and Chengguan District not only led the laborers, but also actively participated in the work, setting an example, so the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. In the Fifth District's Chi Village, because the cadres were not responsible enough, the laborers gathered late (the village was next to the railway), and their enthusiasm was not very high. There were also individual villages that rotated labor every day, creating a situation of passing the buck and dragging their feet. Nangai Zong, for example, rotated labor every two days, and it took five days to complete a three-day task. In Xingtai, Neiqiu, and Gaoyi, some villages had good leadership and implemented a method of evaluating and grading work, adding points for those who actively contributed and deducting points for those who did not, which had a stimulating effect.

　　III. Constant Inspection, Timely Correction, and Mutual Exchange of Experience

　　Lincheng and Xingtai both organized inspection sections (or inspection teams) in the county headquarters. In addition to county and district cadres and comrades from the Highway Bureau, veteran railway workers were also enlisted to participate. Yuanshi and Gaoyi conducted district inspections, with village cadres forming inspection teams, inspecting at any time, immediately pointing out and correcting any shortcomings. The good practices of each village were learned by others. For example, Yuanshi's Sixth District found it very convenient to pick stones with iron rakes, which was immediately disseminated to the Fifth District, who borrowed them from nearby villages. If the tamping in some villages was not solid, they were asked to redo it. This requires constant inspection and timely correction during the work. In some villages in Xingtai, the soil was filled without picking stones, and because the inspection was late, it had to be dug up and redone later, wasting a lot of labor.

　　Mobilizing support is also very important. Due to the inadequate and inaccurate initial estimates of work, the stone-picking work was not calculated. Therefore, the original allocation of long sections with few laborers, such as Yuanshi's Fifth District and the area south of Guluying in Lincheng, completed the work late. Mobilizing support is a major mobilization effort. On the third day, Yuanshi's Fifth District saw that other districts had completed their work, while only four villages in their district had completed. So, they planned to mobilize support. Before the leadership mobilized, the Shangzhuang Village cadres mobilized the masses, saying: "We and Goubei are neighboring villages, and our road sections are next to each other. We have finished repairing, but they haven't. Let's help them out, and we'll all go back together soon, okay?" The masses of the entire village agreed, and immediately went to help automatically. The district cadres took this opportunity to mobilize support at the village cadre meeting and educate the masses. By nightfall, the entire district had completed the work.

　　IV. Constant Selection of Role Models and Timely Rewards

　　Lincheng's approach was that when county and district cadres were leading the road repair, they paid attention to the quality of the work and also to discovering heroes and role models. They announced their exemplary deeds to the masses and rewarded them with material goods to promote the enthusiasm of the laborers. In Yuanshi, during breaks, each team was allowed to deliberate and select representatives, and then groups were compared with each other. If there were good ones, they were given real objects (salt) on the spot. In addition, each county formulated award flags, which were planted by the roadside, which greatly encouraged the masses. Yuanshi and Lincheng also rewarded model cooks, which improved the cooks' enthusiasm, ensuring that the food was ready for the people, not the other way around. Some villages even converted the rice into flour to improve living conditions, providing the laborers with a guarantee of their livelihood.

　　In this road repair effort, the publicity and mobilization work in each county played a significant role. In addition to the county headquarters organizing publicity sections and transferring teachers for publicity, Lincheng also set up radio stations and blackboards in the villages where the laborers were housed to commend role models. The content of the publicity mainly focused on the current situation, especially the complete liberation of the Northeast and the elimination of more than a million Chiang Kai-shek bandits, combined with the Northeast Army entering the customs and heading south, and the promotion of the people's interests by defeating Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, which was most effective in boosting the morale of the masses. The masses in Lincheng reflected, "Once the Pinghan Railway is open to traffic, the large army will definitely go south!" Wang Fuxiang, a martyr's family member in Beimeng Village, said, "Quickly repair the railway so that the large army can go south and avenge my son!" He tamped the soil with great effort. The masses also easily accepted the publicity that being able to burn coal would be very convenient, reduce the need for labor service, find work, and that having coal to burn could save firewood and accumulate more fertilizer and produce more grain. This publicity not only encouraged and motivated the enthusiasm of the masses for road repair, but more importantly, in such a relatively broad mobilization of labor, it directly conducted a propaganda and education campaign, enabling the masses to have a clearer understanding of the current situation. In addition, the road repair was a practical action to support the large army heading south, which further strengthened the masses' confidence in victory.

　　元氏等县修路的经验
  　一、事前准备工作
    各县都先成立了县指挥部，元氏、高邑、内邱、邢台等县县长都参加，临城由秘书参加。首先检查了路基破坏的情况并估计了修复工程用工数目，分段插牌，邢台还吸收了旧铁路工人帮助测量和估计工数。
    （一）组织工作的准备：各县指挥部都是比较有力量的，县长、科长或秘书、武委会主任等亲自参加指挥，在组织机构上，邢台分为组织调动劳力股、技术指导股、宣传股、检查股，元氏抽出二十个小学教员参加宣传。区指挥部由区长或坚强干部负责指挥，村一级是主要干部当队长，下设组长，分成小组（或班），一般是十——十五人一组。高邑和元氏王宋村把民兵配到各班当班长，起了骨干和带头作用，除此以外还有防空警戒组织，每区抽出几个民兵在民工住宿村庄担任警戒，防备坏人捣乱，每晚在一定时间内，抽一、二人专门负责防空吹号，在群众防空准备上，临城高邑都带紫花大袍或被单，遇有飞机可以掩盖，并在路旁挖防空洞（临城群众穿紫花布的少所以准备的很少），元氏六区指定了十一个较好干部组成治安小组，注意坏人破坏行动。
    （二）工具准备：由于领导上对于修路的工程生疏经验少，所以对工具的准备也只是根据所用的打夯拣石子和土工情况准备的，高邑、元氏、邢台带工具多，做工就不误，但有的村带的夯少，填上土打夯时别人就得住了手，等打完再填土。临城知道夯可能少，但事前没有作出肯定决议来，普遍带的夯少，元氏五区因分的石子工多而带的拣石子工具少，也大大吃了亏，既费功又误工，虽然各村都连夜回去赶拿造或借用，但终于影响了工作。
    （三）事务工作的准备：如此规模较大的动员民力做工，在事务工作上必须有较周密的准备，方能保持民工情绪的经常。元氏六区村干部分工，正队长管动员民力，副队长管事务准备，他们负责计划和准备住房，吃饭家具、柴、菜、米等物，高邑每村选一事务管理，每个民工带米六斤、菜十斤、柴五十斤，菜金五百元，由事务员管理收支记帐，吃饭和住宿准备的好，民工情绪就好，也不致发生什么问题。
    （四）工程计算的准备：开始多是县指挥部根据破坏程度估计的用工数，邢台吸收旧铁路工人帮助测量和估工，但在估计中一般是不合实际的，内邱开始估计全县调动二万个民力，得修十二天才能完成，但实际上只动员了一万九千五百八十一个人在三天半内就完成了，其他县估计的也不够精确，后来是公路局同志们测量的，但因事前没有估计到拣石子的工程，只是量了一下土坑的深度和长宽，计算了方数和用工数，坑和坑中间的拣石子工一概没计，有的从远处取土也未计算，结果仍与实际用工不符，这对动员民力也就会有浪费，邢台、内邱、元氏、临城都有原来估计用工不多动员民力就少，而结果是顶费工的地方。这样就使任务加重影响了民工的情绪，这是事先对于工程计划的不够周密的缘故，如果事先估计周到，估工是会比较更加正确的。
    二、布置具体明确才少发生问题
    对于工程的标准原来只是要求石子拣净夯打好，路基保持原状，但没有更明确的和更具体的布置，因此就发生了问题。临城一二区以补要村为标准，并组织了检查团，吸收老铁路工人检查，合乎标准的就交工，因此搞的较好，三区没有实行这个办法，所以作得便不好。（石子拣的不净、夯不实、挖了一些旧路基）
    此外，发挥村干部的领导力量是很重要的问题：因为县区干部有限，路段很长，光来回跑也顾不过来，根据临城、邢台、元氏等县经验，发挥村干部和小组长的指挥和领导作用对民工的掌握就有力。临城先在一村作出经验来推动别村，一面检查一面指出缺点。元氏六区和城关区的村干部，不但负责指挥民工，而且都积极参加做工，起了带头作用，所以群众的劲头就很大。五区池村因干部负责不够，民工集合的晚（该村挨着铁路）干起来劲头也不大。还有个别村每天换工，形成支差磨洋工的现象，南盖宗就是每两天换一次工，三天任务五天才完成。邢台、内邱、高邑有的村领导好，实行了评工评分办法，积极出力就加分，不出力的就减分，这样起了刺激作用。
    三、不断检查及时纠正互相交流经验
    临城、邢台都在县指挥部组织了检查股（或检查组）除县区干部和公路局同志外还吸收了老铁路工人参加，元氏、高邑分区检查，由村干部组成检查团，随时检查，见到不好的地方马上提出意见纠正，好的各村就学习，如元氏六区用铁杈拣石子很方便，马上传播到五区就去近村借用，有的村打夯不坚实，就让他另打。这必须是在作工时不断检查及时的指正，邢台有的村填土不拣石子，因检查的晚，以后又翻出来另作，浪费了很多工。
    发动支援问题也是很重要的，由于开始估计工作的不周密和不准确，对拣石子工没有计算，因此分地段长的原认为工小的地方，如元氏五区、临城古鲁营以南分的地段很长民工数少，就完成的晚。发动支援是一件较大的动员工作。元氏五区在第三天看到别区都已完成，该区才完成了四个村，就计划动员支援，在领导上动员以前，上庄村干就动员群众说：“咱和沟北是邻村，路段又挨着，咱修完了，他们还不完，咱们帮助他们一下，很快完就一块回去了，大家同意不？”全村群众都很同意，马上就去自动的帮助，区干部就趁此在村干会上动员支援，并教育群众，到天黑就使全区都完工了。
    四、随时评选模范及时发奖
    临城作法是县区干部在领导修路时，一面注意作工的好坏，同时注意发现英雄和模范人物，把他们的模范事迹向群众宣布，奖给物质，推动民工的积极性；元氏则是在休息时，让各班酝酿评选，选出后再组和组比，有好的就当下发给实物（食盐）。另外各县都制定了奖旗，插在路旁，对群众的鼓舞非常重大。元氏临城对模范火夫也同样发奖，提高了火夫积极性，做到了能让饭等人，不让人等饭，并有的村把米改碾成面，改善了生活，给了民工以生活保证。
    这次修路中，各县在宣传动员工作上起了很大作用，除县指挥部组织宣传股和调教员宣传外，临城还在民工住宿村庄设广播台和黑板报，表扬模范，宣传内容多以当前的形势，特别是东北的全境解放和消灭蒋匪百万以上的兵力，结合了东北大军进关南下，早日打垮蒋介石对群众利益的宣传，在鼓舞群众情绪上最有效力，临城群众反映说：“平汉路一通车，大军一定是南下呀！”北孟村烈属王福祥说：“赶快修好铁路，大军南下就能给我儿子报仇了。”他打夯顶努力。对群众能烧煤炭很方便，可少支差，可以找生活，有了煤烧可省下柴禾多积肥多打粮食的宣传，群众也最易接受。这次宣传还不仅是鼓舞和发挥了群众修路的积极性，更重要的是在这样比较广泛的动员民力场合下，直接的进行了一次宣传和教育，使群众对当前的形势有了比较明确的认识，再加上修路正是支援大军南下的实际行动，更加强了群众的胜利信心。
