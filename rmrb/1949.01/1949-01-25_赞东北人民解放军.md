　　Praising the Northeast People's Liberation Army
　　The Northeast Army is brave and strong, annihilating enemy and puppet forces
　　Like taking something out of a bag, wherever the spearhead points, immediate liberation
　　With the Northeast pacified, they wield their weapons southward, the army's momentum is surging
　　Vast and mighty, entering the pass, the bandit Fu is alarmed
　　Having captured Yu and Qin, they then take Luan and Tang, winning victory after victory
　　Tianjin and Beijing are in tension, the people and soldiers of North China are overjoyed
　　Everywhere in the streets and alleys, nothing but praise

　　赞东北人民解放军
    东北大军　英勇坚强　歼灭敌伪
    势如探囊　矛头所指　立即解放
    东北既靖　挥戈南向　军势汹涌
    浩浩荡荡　进得关来　傅匪着慌
    既克榆秦　再取滦唐　连战连捷
    平津紧张　华北军民　欢欣若狂
    街头巷尾　莫不颂扬
