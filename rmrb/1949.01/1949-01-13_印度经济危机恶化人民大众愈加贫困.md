　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. The past year has been one of further deterioration in India's economic crisis. According to a special article in the Indian magazine "Eastern Economist" cited by TASS: India's national income is decreasing more and more. The national income per capita was 67 rupees in 1939-1940, decreased to 64 rupees in 1944-1945, and further decreased to 62 rupees in 1947-1948. The magazine also pointed out that under the government's reactionary measures, workers' labor productivity decreased, and the mass impoverishment resulted in a sharp reduction in the consumption of food and textiles. The reduction in the production of steel, cement, and other industrial products proves the overall crisis of the Indian economy. The publication also stated that despite some increase in India's cultivated land area, the 1948 harvest did not reach the projected output. India's food deficit reached 2.5 million tons, forcing India to spend more than 1 billion rupees (nearly 20 percent of its total imports) to buy food from foreign countries. Many other Indian newspapers, in articles reviewing 1948, expressed dissatisfaction and disappointment with the current situation in India under the rule of the Nehru reactionary clique. The Indian Communist Party's organ, "People's Age," stated that the dictatorship of the bourgeois landlord group has formed in India. The "Free Press" reported that India's economy has deteriorated and the people's freedoms no longer exist.

　　印度经济危机恶化人民大众愈加贫困
    【新华社陕北九日电】过去一年是印度经济危机更加恶化的一年。据塔斯社引印度“东方经济学家”杂志的专文指出：印度的国民收入，正在愈益减少，一九三九——一九四○年的国民收入每人为六十七卢比，一九四四年——一九四五年减至六十四卢比，一九四七——四八年又减至六十二卢比。该杂志又指出：在政府的反动措施下，工人劳动生产率减低，人民大众赤贫化结果粮食与纺织物消费为之大减。钢铁、水泥及其他工业品生产的减少，证明了印度经济的总危机。该刊又称：尽管印度耕地面积有某些增加，但一九四八年的收获并未达到预计的产量。印度粮食亏空达二百五十万吨。这使印度不得不花十亿余卢比（几占其进口总值的百分之二十）向外国购买粮食。许多其他印度报纸于追述一九四八年的文章中，均对尼赫鲁反动集团统治下的印度目前情势，表示不满与失望。印共机关报“人民世纪”称：资产阶级地主集团的独裁制度，已在印度形成。“自由新闻”报称：印度的经济已经恶化，人民的自由权利已不复存在。
