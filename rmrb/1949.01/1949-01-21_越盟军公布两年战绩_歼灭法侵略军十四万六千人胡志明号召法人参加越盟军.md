Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Late news from Vietnam: Viet Minh headquarters issued a communique on December 19th of last year, the second anniversary of the outbreak of the full-scale Viet-French war, summarizing the battle achievements of the past two years as follows: A total of 71,300 French troops were killed, 63,900 were wounded (according to Viet Minh's estimates for 1947, a total of 60,600 French troops were killed or wounded); 2,500 people were captured; 8,863 French troops surrendered. A total of 146,563 enemies were annihilated in two years. The ratio of French to Viet Minh military deaths was seven to one. In the two years, the Viet Minh army seized weapons from the French army, including 4,600 rifles and 113 mortars; the Viet Minh army also shot down 37 French aircraft, 150 gunboats, and 4 million liters of gasoline. The order issued by the Viet Minh headquarters declared: The third year will be a year of decisive victory.

President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a letter to the French people on the same day, saying: "You know that when a nation is determined to fight for its independence and freedom, nothing can hinder its success and victory." Ho Chi Minh called on the French people to join the Viet Minh army and jointly defeat the French colonialists.

Note: The Vietnamese War of Independence began on September 23, 1945. During the initial period of more than a year, due to the incomplete French military deployment in Vietnam, a situation of "fighting and talking" between France and Vietnam emerged. On December 16, 1946, Blum, the reactionary leader of the French Socialist Party, came to power, and three days later (the 19th), the French army launched a major offensive against the Viet Minh army. On the same day, the Viet Minh army withdrew from the Viet Minh capital, Hanoi. The "fighting and talking" situation ended, and a full-scale war broke out. From then until 1947, the French army adopted a strategic offensive and exchanged a large number of casualties for the occupation of points and lines, with an area accounting for about 20% of the total area of Vietnam. However, since the failure of the French winter offensive in December 1947, which resulted in the loss of more than 8,000 troops, the Viet Minh army began to launch a counter-offensive. Since then, the Viet Minh army has recovered three-quarters of the land occupied by the French army, trapping the French army in several major cities such as Saigon, Hanoi, and Haiphong, with an area accounting for only 5% of the total area of Vietnam.

　　越盟军公布两年战绩
    歼灭法侵略军十四万六千人胡志明号召法人参加越盟军
    【新华社陕北十六日电】越南迟到消息：越盟军总部于去年十二月十九日越法全面战争爆发两周年纪念日发表公报，总结两年来的战绩如下：计毙法军七万一千三百人，伤六万三千九百人（按一九四七年越盟军共毙伤法军六万零六百名）；俘二千五百人；法军投降者八千八百六十三人。两年间共歼敌十四万六千五百六十三人。法越军阵亡人数为七与一之比。两年间越盟军缴获法军的武器中，包括步枪四千六百枝，迫击炮一百十三门；越盟军并击毁法军飞机三十七架，炮艇一百五十艘，汽油四百万公升。越盟军总部颁发的命令宣称：第三年将是取得决定性胜利的一年。
    越南民主共和国总统胡志明，于同日发表告法国人民书称：“你们知道，当一个民族决心为其独立与自由而战时，是任何东西也阻挠不了它的成功与胜利的。”胡志明呼吁法国人民参加越盟军，共同击败法国殖民者。
    按：越南独立战争开始于一九四五年九月二十三日。在起初的一年多期间，由于法国在越的军事部署尚未完成，因而呈现了法越之间“边打边谈”的局面。一九四六年十二月十六日，法社会党反动头子勃鲁姆登台，三天以后（十九日），法军大举进攻越盟军。同日，越盟军退出越盟首府河内。“边谈边打”局面结束，全面战争爆发。从那时起至一九四七年的一年中，法军采取战略进攻，并以大量的伤亡换得了点线的占领，其面积约占全越面积百分之二十。但从一九四七年十二月法方冬季攻势失败，丧师八千余后，越盟军即开始实行反攻，从那时以来，越盟军已收复了法军所侵占的土地四分之三，使法军被困于西贡、河内、海防等几个大城市，面积仅及全越的百分之五。
