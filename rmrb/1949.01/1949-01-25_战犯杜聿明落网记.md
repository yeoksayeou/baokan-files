Record of the Capture of the War Criminal Du Yuming
　　Wang Ying Wu Jianren
The war criminal Du Yuming disguised himself as a "prisoner" in an attempt to escape, but ended up truly becoming a prisoner.

On the tenth of this month, just as it was getting light, fourteen soldiers carrying weapons ran in a panic to the edge of Zhanglaozhuang village in Yongcheng. They hesitated to enter the village when they encountered a local. One of them asked furtively, "Are there any troops in your village?" The villager replied, "The surrounding dozens or hundreds of miles are full of Liberation Army troops." The soldier quickly took out a gold ring from his pocket and stuffed it into the villager's hand: "Take this! We are here, don't tell them!" The villager, seeing their flustered expression, was very surprised and knew they were up to no good, so he turned around and rushed back to the village to report to a certain unit of the Liberation Army. The unit immediately dispatched Fan Zhengguo, Cui Xueyun, and others to pursue. The fourteen men, seeing that they were being chased, immediately went prone and prepared to resist. The pursuers spread out and advanced, and Fan Zhengguo shouted, "Who are you? Send one up!" One of the fourteen men, claiming to be a "captain," came forward and asked Fan Zhengguo, "Which unit are you with?" Fan Zhengguo said, "I am from the × Column ×× Division, which unit are you with?" The "captain" replied, "I just came back from the rear, the division commander ordered me to escort prisoners to the rear, I don't even know the division commander's name." As he spoke, he pointed to a "prisoner" behind him with his hands tied behind his back. Fan Zhengguo, seeing that they were not dressed like Liberation Army soldiers and their expressions were very unnatural, and noticing that he was carrying a fast-slow machine gun, immediately snatched the gun from his body, chambered a round, and pointed it at his chest, ordering him to tell the others to surrender their weapons. The thirteen men behind him, upon hearing the order to "surrender weapons," obediently threw down four Thompson submachine guns, one carbine, three fast-slow machine guns, and four Canadian pistols. At this time, the "prisoner" was still standing there motionless, also carrying a fast-slow machine gun. Fan Zhengguo went up and took his gun.

Fan Zhengguo, Cui Xueyun, and a company of soldiers escorted these fourteen men back to Zhanglaozhuang and transferred them to the political department of a certain unit. Director Chen of the political department sized up the so-called "prisoner": sunken nose, uneven stubble on his lip. Even though he was wearing a soldier's uniform, it was obvious at a glance that he was a high-ranking Kuomintang officer. Looking at the other thirteen men, they were definitely not ordinary soldiers either. He saw through the fact that the "prisoner" was trying to escape with a group of guards. So he fixed his gaze on the so-called "prisoner" and interrogated him: "What do you do?" "I am a quartermaster of the 13th Army Corps," he replied. "How many departments are there in your army corps headquarters?" "Six departments." "What are the names of the heads of the six departments? Write them down for me." He took a pen and wrote on the paper for a long time, but could not write anything. "What rank are you exactly? Tell the truth." Director Chen, seeing his panicked expression, continued the interrogation, "I am really not an officer, I am a quartermaster." "Who exactly are you? You better tell me quickly, you can't hide it. Weren't Huang Wei and Wu Shaozhou found out?" He stammered and pleaded, "I am indeed a quartermaster, you will find out later." The "quartermaster" was taken to another room to rest. He was given food, but he did not eat. He sighed and groaned in the room. After a while, he deliberately bumped his head a little, closed his eyes, and lay on the ground pretending to be dead. Later, the Liberation Army soldiers compared a photo of Du Yuming with him, and they were exactly the same, except for a missing tuft of mustache. That evening, it was confirmed by Zhang Yinguo, the captured automobile adjutant of the Xuzhou "Suppression General Headquarters," that the guy pretending to be dead was none other than the top war criminal Du Yuming, deputy commander of the Kuomintang Xuzhou "Suppression General Headquarters." Zhang Yinguo told the Liberation Army: "As soon as Deputy Commander Du left Xuzhou, he changed into a soldier's uniform. Yesterday, he shaved off his beloved mustache. But he was still caught by you." After rigorous interrogation and verification by the People's Liberation Army, the "quartermaster" finally could not deny it and lowered his head in despair, timidly saying, "I...I am Du Yuming!"

　　战犯杜聿明落网记
    王英　吴健人
    战犯杜聿明化装“俘虏”，企图逃跑，结果真正当了俘虏。
    本月十日，天才发亮，十四个手持武器的士兵，慌慌张张地跑到永城张老庄的村边。他们在村边碰到了一个老乡，就迟疑地不敢进村。其中一个鬼鬼祟祟地问道：“你们庄上有队伍吗？”老乡回答说：“周围几十里几百里都驻满了解放军。”那个士兵连忙从口袋里掏出一个金戒指塞在老乡手里：“你拿去吧！我们在这里，你不要告诉他们！”老乡看他们慌张的神情，心中十分诧异，晓得他们来路不正，转身赶回庄上报告解放军某部。某部马上派了樊正国、崔雪云等前往追赶。那十四个人看到后面有人追赶，立即伏下准备抵抗。追兵们就散开前进，樊正国大声喝问：“什么人？上来一个！”那十四个人当中来了一个自称是“队长”的，问樊正国：“是那一部分的？”樊正国说：“俺是×纵××师，你是那部分？”那个“队长”回答：“我也是×纵××师，我们同你们都是一个师的！”樊正国便问：“师长姓什么？”他说：“我从后方才回来，师长命令我押俘虏去后方的，师长姓名还不知道。”说时指了指在他后面两手反绑着的一个“俘虏”。樊正国看他们穿的服装不象解放军的样子，神情又很不自然，身上挂着一支快慢机，便马上把他身上的枪夺下来，将子弹推上膛，对准他的胸口，要他叫其余的人缴枪。后面那十三个家伙一听“檄枪”，就都很驯服地把四支汤姆枪、一支卡宾枪、三支快慢机、四支加拿大手枪都丢下来了。这时那个“俘虏”还站在那里不动，身上也挂着一支快慢机，樊正国便上去把他枪下了。
    樊正国、崔雪云和一个连的战士，把这十四个人押回张老庄，转送到某部政治部。政治部陈主任一打量那个所谓“俘虏”：凹鼻梁，唇上有着不整齐的胡根，尽管他穿着士兵的衣服，但一望而知是个国民党高级军官。再看一看其他十三个人，也决不是普通当兵的。他便看穿是那个“俘虏”带着一群卫兵企图漏网的。于是他便钉住那个所谓“俘虏”审问：“你是干什么的？”“我是十三兵团的军需。”他回答。“你们兵团部有几大处？”“六大处。”“六大处的处长叫什么名字，写给我看。”他拿了一支钢笔，在纸上写了半天，却写不出来。“你倒底是什么官？老实说。”陈主任看他神色惊慌不定，继续审讯，“我实在不是一个官，是个军需。”“你倒底是什么人，还是快点说出来，你是隐瞒不了的，黄维、吴绍周不都查出来了吗？”他又支支吾吾地哀求说：“我确实是个军需，你们以后会查得清的。”这个“军需”被送到另外一间房子去休息，给他饭吃，他不吃，在房子里唉声叹气，待了一会，故意自己碰破一点头皮，闭起眼睛，躺在地上假装死。以后，解放军的战士拿了一张杜聿明的照片和他一对，完全一样，就是少了一簇小胡子。当天晚上，又从被俘获的徐州“剿总”汽车副官张印国的口中，证实这个假装死的家伙，就是头等战争罪犯国民党徐州“剿总”副总司令杜聿明。张印国对解放军说：“杜副总司令从徐州一出来，他就换了士兵衣服，昨天他又把他心爱的小胡子剃掉。但是还是被你们捉住了。”经过人民解放军的严厉审讯和对证，那个“军需”最后无法抵赖，才绝望地低下头去，胆怯地说：“我……我是杜聿明！”
