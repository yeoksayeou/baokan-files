　　Great Victory on the Pingjin Front
  　The Rear Erupts in a Wave of Support for the Troops
    [Our Dispatch] As news of victories for the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin Front continues to pour in, government offices, factories, and schools in the rear have universally launched a wave of support for the troops. To express heartfelt condolences and leave a memento, each government office and department has universally adopted the method of making comfort bags and writing comfort letters, sending them one after another to the front lines. Factories subordinate to the Logistics, Supply, and Ordnance Departments of the North China Military Region, some of which are as far as two hundred li away, delivered all their comfort items in just three or four days. The First Factory of the Second Clothing Bureau of the Supply Department launched a movement on January 14th to write comfort letters to the Northeast People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin Front. Apprentice worker Ma Liubao wrote: "Hearing that you have entered the pass, my heart is truly happy... We must step up production, not delay your clothing, and resolve to make the clothes well, so that you have no complaints when you wear them." Day and night, in dormitories and workshops, workers squeezed in time from production to busy themselves writing comfort letters. Literate workers wrote, and illiterate workers spoke, completing one hundred and ninety-four letters in less than a day. The Student Union of the Engineering College of North China University specially sent people to Shijiazhuang to have comfort bags custom-made, to ensure they were neat and beautiful. They were all filled with towels, soap, toothbrushes, socks, etc. Hearing that soldiers most easily lose buttons during combat, they specially bought many needles, thread, and buttons to include. The students of the college said: "If we know what the soldiers need, we will do our best to find ways to buy it for them, so that they do not feel difficulties in combat and bring us even greater victories." Students at the North China Medical University made comfort bags, some making two each. One person making one said: "Don't look down on me for making one, it's genuine, and I must pack it full." The person making two disagreed, saying, "Making two is not just for show, I must pack them into round eggs." The items packed in the bags were all after research and discussion. Some people packed thread for the soldiers, fearing that loose strands would be inconvenient, so they specially wound it on small sticks. Some comfort bags were sewn with double-layered cloth and double thread, for durability. A classmate who was ill insisted on making them, even though the class did not want him to, making one after another. Some male classmates who usually couldn't hold a needle not only took the initiative this time, but also made them more meticulously than the female classmates. Some teams in the school specially established "preparatory groups" for supporting the army, planning to uniformly cut and purchase items. The school planned to make eight hundred comfort bags, and because everyone's enthusiasm was exceptionally high, it is estimated that the plan will be exceeded. The North China Postal and Telecommunications Bureau leadership issued a call to support the army on the morning of the 10th of this month, and by 2:00 PM that day, a comrade from the communications team delivered a yellow twill comfort bag to the labor committee, containing "four-in-one" soap that he was reluctant to use, tightly sewn socks, a military diary, etc. This beginning led all comrades in the bureau to join the movement of making comfort bags. Everyone confidently said, "Not only must the items packed in it be durable, but the bags must also be made beautifully, so that the soldiers will like them at first glance." Some people disliked what they made and tore it apart to make another. Some government offices and schools, such as the Second Clothing Dyeing Factory of the Military Supply Department, the First Middle School of the Beiyue District, and the Gaoyang Central Dyeing and Rolling Factory in Jizhong, enthusiastically donated money and sent it to the front lines. In addition to donating money, the Yuncheng Salt Affairs Brigade also provided seven self-filling fountain pens, more than one hundred and seventy towels, more than one hundred and twenty pairs of socks, more than forty bars of soap, and seventy-two comfort letters.

　　平津前线大胜利
  　后方一片劳军声
    【本报综合讯】当平津前线东北、华北两大解放军胜利消息不断传来之际，后方各机关、工厂、学校普遍掀起劳军热潮。为了表达衷心的慰问并留为纪念，各机关、部门都普遍采取了做慰问袋及写慰问信的方式，纷纷寄往前方。华北军区后勤、供给、军械各部下属各工厂，有的厂虽远在二百里外，但短短三、四日内，即将慰劳品全部交齐。供给部被服二局第一厂，一月十四日发起向平津前线东北人民解放军写慰问信运动，学徒工人马留保写道：“听到你们进了关，我这心里真喜欢………我们要加油齐生产，不误你们把衣穿，决心把衣服做的好，叫你们穿上没意见。”全厂白天、黑夜，宿舍、工房里，工人们挤着生产空隙，都忙着写慰问信，识字的工人执笔，不识字的口念，不到一天时间，写起一百九十四封。华北大学工学院学生会，为了整齐、美观，特派人到石家庄定做慰问袋。都装的毛巾、肥皂、牙刷、袜子等。因听说战士在作战时最容易掉扣子，他们特买了很多针、线、扣子装上。该院同学们说：“我们如果知道战士需要什么，一定尽力设法给他们买，让他们作战时不感困难，好给我们带来更伟大的胜利。”华北医科大学同学做慰问袋，有的一人做了两个。做一个的人说：“别看我做一个，货真价实，一定要装它个满鼓鼓的。”做两个的不服气说：“做两个也不是装样子，一定要装成圆鸡蛋。”袋里装的东西都经过了研究讨论，有的人给战士们装了线，怕一缕缕的不好用，特别缠在小棍上。有的慰问袋用双层布双线缝，为了坚固耐用。一位临病的同学，班里不叫他做，他坚持着非做不可，做了一个又一个。有些平常拿不起针的男同学，这次不但亲自动手，在精心制作之下，比女同学也不弱。该校有的队特别成立了劳军“筹备小组”有计划的统一裁剪，购买物品。全校计划做慰问袋八百个，因大家情绪异常高涨，估计将超过计划。华北邮电总局本月十日上午领导上刚发出劳军号召，当天下午两点通讯班的一位同志即将一个黄色斜纹布的慰问袋交到了劳委会，里面装着自己舍不得用的“四合一”香皂、密密地缝了底儿的袜子、军用日记本等。这一开头，全局同志都卷入做慰问袋运动。大家都自信的说：“不但装的东西很耐用，袋子也得做的漂亮，叫战士们一看就喜欢。”有的人做起了嫌不好，又拆了另做。有的机关学校如军供部第二被服染布厂、北岳区第一中学，冀中高阳中染轧工厂等都热烈捐款，送往前方。运城盐务大队除捐款外，又慰劳自来水钢笔七枝，毛巾一百七十余条，袜子一百二十余双，肥皂四十多条，慰问信七十二封。（顾迪、笑川、葛钦、郭斌、霍光、柏阳、牛奇、张绍组等）
