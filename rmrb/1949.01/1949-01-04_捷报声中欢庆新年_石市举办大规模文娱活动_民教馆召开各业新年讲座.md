Amidst frequent reports of victory from both the North and South fronts, Shijiazhuang's various agencies, organizations, schools, and citizens are celebrating their second New Year after liberation with excitement. The People's Education Center is preparing a large-scale art exhibition, entertainment programs, lectures, and forums. They have arranged two exhibition halls, with exhibits including photos, paper-cut posters, wall newspapers, and New Year pictures. The photos include more than 160 pieces covering various aspects of rear production, support for the front lines, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. The paper-cut posters depict Soviet construction, the Five-Year Plan, and more. The New Year pictures are works by the Popular Art Society, most of which reflect support for the front lines and rear production. The wall newspapers are compiled by the Women's Federation, amateur supplementary schools, and other schools. Broadcasting from New Year's Day to the 4th will add entertainment programs, including Hebei Bangzi opera, Peking opera, drum ballad, singing, and other items. The singing has already secured singing teams from the First, Second, Third Primary Schools, Rotary Primary School, and other schools. The lectures organized by the People's Education Center include a workers' lecture on the 2nd, given by Comrade Liu Xiufeng; an intellectuals' lecture on the 5th, given by Comrade Wu Liren; and a lecture for merchants and citizens on the 6th, given by Comrade Lu Yifu. After the meeting, films will be shown to entertain the audience, and forums will be held separately for military dependents and merchants. The museum's art factory is also rushing to produce large murals such as "Victory of the Huaihai Campaign" and "Chaos Within the Kuomintang."

The middle schools are also practicing singing, Yangko dancing, and rehearsing new dramas. The Second Municipal Middle School is preparing to hold a learning achievement exhibition and a parents' meeting. Most of the scripts are written by students based on their own actual lives, such as "Model Group" and "The Ideological Transformation of a Student." "Shu Lai Bao" and crosstalk are also newly created. Performances outside the school include Yangko dancing, singing, and the performance of the living newspaper play "Heaven and Earth Net." The Municipal Girls' Middle School is preparing for off-campus activities and has specially invited comrades from the Opera and Music Work Committee to teach Yangko and singing. A teacher-student gathering will be held on the 31st, with games such as answering lantern riddles. The Middle School Student Union Committee decided to hold a city-wide middle school student evening party at the Art Theater on New Year's Day evening, and each school will have programs to perform.

On the evening of the 3rd, the Municipal Club held a mass evening party in each district, and Mayor Ke will attend and give a speech. After the meeting, there will be an evening party, with Peking opera "Killing the Fisherman's Family," "Farewell to the Kiln," and drama "Hometown" and other performances to add to the fun.

The sanitation workers have cleaned the main streets of the city spotlessly; the city government's road rollers have also appeared on the asphalt roads, repairing uneven road surfaces, and many colorful arches have been set up on both sides of the streets; Yangko tunes and drums are spreading from every agency, factory, and school to the streets.
