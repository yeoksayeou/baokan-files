Criticism and Suggestions

　　Speculative Buying Causes Grain Price Fluctuations
  　Tongren Cooperative Should Conduct Inspections
To the Editor:
    On December 16th, it was discovered in Cixian County that two merchants were speculating and抢购麦子, which led to an increase in grain prices. Within ten days, from December 16th to 26th, the price of millet rose from 500 Jibi yuan per jin to 800 yuan per jin, and the price of wheat rose from 520 yuan per jin to 850 yuan per jin, causing great panic among the masses. These two speculative merchants were old merchants hired by the Handan Municipal机关生产 Tongren Cooperative. One was named Zhang Zhenyu, and the other was named Guo Yintang. They specialized in running around各市场乱抓, seeking opportunities to speculate and take advantage, stirring up trouble in物价, only for profit, disregarding policies, laws, and the interests of the masses. On December 15th, they went from Handan to Wu'an Yong茂昌 to speculate and purchase grain. After being recognized and dissuaded by Chen Luoxian, the manager of Taihang Trading Company Wu'an Yong茂昌, they went to the Cixian Yong茂昌 branch and requested to purchase grain, saying, "The higher authorities sent the two of us to buy some wheat, one for the branch to eat and the other to调剂市场." The Yong茂昌 branch sold them 30,000 jin of wheat at a price of 520 yuan per jin. However, seeing the potential for profit, these two people colluded with private merchants Wang Tong and Wang Cheng to purchase 10,000 jin of wheat from the Yong茂昌 branch for them. They also抢购 10,000 jin of wheat in the market. In one or two days, they purchased a total of 50,000 jin and囤积 it in the Yifeng Flower Shop. Then, these two people ran to Shuiye to抢购 grain, causing grain prices to rise and causing panic among the masses. Later, Taihang Trading Company's Yong茂昌 branch and the United Public Grain Store sold large quantities of millet and wheat on the market at平价, which stabilized the situation and calmed the public's mind. I request the government to severely investigate and deal with private merchants and机关生产 personnel who speculate and create fluctuations in grain prices, and I hope that the person in charge of the Tongren Cooperative will conduct an inspection and respond.

### 投机抢购引起粮价波动　同仁合作社应作检查

　　投机抢购引起粮价波动
  　同仁合作社应作检查编辑同志：
    十二月十六日，在磁县发现了两个商人投机抢购麦子，致引起粮价上涨。十六日至二十六日十天内，小米每斤由冀钞五百元涨至八百元，麦子每斤由五百二十元涨到八百五十元，群众非常恐慌。这两个投机商人是邯郸市机关生产同仁合作社雇用的旧商人，一个叫张振玉，一个叫郭印堂，他们专门在各市场乱跑乱抓，寻空找隙投机取巧，在物价上兴风作浪，只为赚钱，不顾政策法令和群众利益。他们在十二月十五日由邯郸到武安永茂昌投机购粮，被太行贸易公司武安永茂昌陈罗仙经理识破劝阻后，便又到磁县永茂昌分栈要求购粮，说是“上级差我二人来购些麦子，一为本栈吃，二为调剂市场。”永茂昌分栈就卖给他们三万斤麦子，以每斤五百二十元给他们合价，可是这两个人见着有利，便又勾通私商王同、王成二人，替他向永茂昌分栈购了一万斤麦子，又在市场抢购了一万斤麦子，一两日内共抢购五万斤，在益丰花店囤积起来，而后这两人又跑到水冶抢购粮食，闹得粮价上涨，群众恐慌。后来太行贸易公司永茂昌分栈、联合大公粮店，用大批小米麦子出售市场平价，才稳定下来，安定了民心。我要求政府对投机取巧、造成粮价波动的私商及机关生产人员，严加究办，并希望同仁合作社负责人检查答复。
