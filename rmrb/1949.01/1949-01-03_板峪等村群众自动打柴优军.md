To solve the problem of firewood shortage for military families in winter, the people of Banyu in Zuoquan, Taihang, Dong'anju in Shexian, and Zishikou in the fifth district of Laiyong in North Yue, voluntarily organized themselves to collect firewood for military families. On the 29th of last month, after listening to explanations in the winter school about the great victories of our army on various battlefields, the village chief of Banyu proposed to everyone: "The front is fighting for us, and we in the rear must ensure that the military families do not freeze, so that the soldiers can fight more at ease. Let's take advantage of the fact that it hasn't snowed yet and quickly collect some firewood for the military families." Everyone agreed. The next day, more than 100 people from the whole village went to the mountains together, collecting more than 12,000 catties of firewood in one day. The people of Dong'anju also collected more than 30,000 catties. The villages in the fifth district of Laishui have also universally launched a campaign to collect firewood to support the military. For example, in Zishikou village, under the slogan of not allowing military families to have difficulty burning firewood, all men, women, old and young in the village were mobilized, collecting more than 35,000 catties in one day. After the villages sent the collected firewood to the military families, the military families were very happy. For example, Yang Qiaolan, a military family member in Dong'anju village, said: "This year, everyone has done a good job of plowing for us, and we don't have to worry about food and drink at all. Just when we were short of firewood, everyone brought it to us. We lack nothing now." Guan Guiying, a military family member in Zishikou, said: "The village takes care of me so well. In order to repay the village for taking care of me, I will write to my husband and ask him to kill the enemy and make meritorious service on the front line, and not return home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated."

　　板峪等村群众自动打柴优军
    【本报讯】为解决军属冬季烧柴困难，太行左权板峪、涉县东安居和北岳涞永五区紫石口等村群众，自动组织起来给军属打柴。上月廿九日，板峪群众在冬校里听了讲解我军在各战场的伟大胜利后，村长向大家提出：“前方给咱们打仗，咱们在后方要保证军属不受冻，叫战士更安心作战，我们趁没有下雪，赶快给军属打些柴吧。”大家都同意。第二天全村一百多人一齐上山，一天打柴一万二千多斤。东安居群众也打了三万多斤。涞水五区各村也普遍开展了打柴优军运动。如紫石口村在不让军属烧柴有困难的口号下，全村男女老少总动员，一天打了三万五千多斤。各村将打的柴分别送给军属后，军属都很高兴。如东安居村军属杨巧兰说：“今年大家给代耕的好，吃喝一点也不愁，光说短些柴烧，大家又给送来了，这可什么也不缺了。”紫石口军属管桂英说：“村里照顾我太好了。我为了报答村中对我的照顾，我要给我丈夫写信，让他在前线好好杀敌立功，不打败蒋贼不回家。”
