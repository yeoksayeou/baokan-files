　　Yalta Agreement—An agreement reached during the meeting between Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill in Yalta, Crimea, southern Soviet Union, from February 4 to 11, 1945, also known as the Crimea Conference Agreement. The main content of the agreement concerned the joint construction of a new Europe and the establishment of lasting world peace after the defeat of Germany. However, the reactionary governments of the United States, Britain, and France, aiming to use Germany as a base for aggression and attempting to provoke a third world war, adopted a policy of splitting Germany, thereby tearing up this agreement.
　　German Socialist Unity Party—The Communist Party and Social Democratic Party in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany merged on April 13, 1946, under the name of the German Socialist Unity Party, to concentrate forces to fight against the reactionary factions of the United States and Britain. At the time of the merger, there were 1.89 million members. The leader was Pieck, and Grotewohl enjoyed great prestige among the German people.
　　German Communist Party—Refers to the German Communist Party in the American, British, and French occupation zones. According to 1947 statistics, there were 350,000 Communist Party members in the three zones. Because the American, British, and French occupation authorities had different methods of suppressing the Communist Party, some Communist Parties in some areas maintained independent activities, while some areas had already established a united front against fascism and for democracy with the local Social Democratic Party and Free Democratic Party.
　　German People's Council—On March 17 of last year, the second session of the German People's Congress was held in Berlin, attended by more than 2,000 representatives from major parties such as the German Socialist Unity Party, the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, various democratic groups, and all social strata. At this meeting, the German People's Council was elected. It is an expansion of the Standing Committee of the German People's Congress. Its task during the adjournment of the Congress is to implement and resolve all the issues raised in the program of the German People's Congress. This committee includes 400 people, headed by a presidium of 29 people led by three chairmen (Pieck of the German Socialist Unity Party is one of them). The presidium is responsible for guiding the work. Under the presidium are a secretariat, the editorial committee of "Deutsche Opinion" (the organ of the German People's Council), an organizing committee, a publishing committee, and special committees to discuss issues such as treaties, constitutions, laws, economics, and culture. The Council represents the German people in demanding German unification. This People's Council has passed resolutions condemning warmongers and the basic principles of the draft constitution of the German Democratic Republic.
　　Warsaw Conference—A foreign ministers' conference initiated by the Soviet Union and Poland in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, on June 23, 1948. Participants included the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary. The task of this conference was to discuss the issues arising from the resolutions of the London Conference on German issues, which was presided over by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France in June of that year with the participation of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and to expose the conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to split Germany and manipulate German industry, and to condemn the United States, Britain, and France for obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The conference passed the following issues, which should be resolved immediately and not delayed: (1) Implement measures to ensure the final demilitarization of Germany through an agreement among the four powers of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. (2) In order to develop the Ruhr industry and prevent the reconstruction of Germany's war potential, determine that the four powers (Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States) control the Ruhr heavy industry for a certain period of time. (3) Establish a democratic and peace-loving provisional government for the whole of Germany through an agreement among the four governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States, consisting of German democratic parties and representatives, with the aim of creating a guarantee to prevent the resurgence of German aggression. (4) Conclude a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, so that the occupying forces of all countries can withdraw from Germany within one year after the conclusion of the treaty. (5) Formulate measures for Germany to fulfill its obligations to compensate countries that have suffered from German aggression.
　　London Six-Power Conference—An illegal conference to split Germany convened by US imperialism and its followers, Britain, France, etc., in violation of the Potsdam Agreement. The first London Conference was convened on February 23 of last year and closed on March 6. Initially, only the United States, Britain, and France participated, but from February 26, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also joined. The following reactionary agreements were reached: (1) Establish a federal German government to dismember Germany. (2) Merge the three occupation zones of the United States, Britain, and France, bring West Germany into the "Western European Group," and give West Germany a superior position in this group. (3) Regarding the Ruhr issue, international control should pay more attention to the distribution of products and less attention to the management of production tools. The second London Conference began on April 20 of last year and lasted for thirty-eight days. Because the US imperialism had the new weapon of threatening other countries to submit due to the passage of the "Marshall Plan" in Congress, it firmly insisted that the joint management of the Ruhr should be limited to the control of the distribution of products, and proposed that the real masters of the Ruhr were Hoffman, the executor of the "Marshall Plan," and Clay, the representative of US imperialism in Germany, turning West Germany into a colony of Wall Street.
　　East German Two-Year Economic Plan—An economic recovery plan for East Germany in the Soviet occupation zone to establish a stable economy and improve the living standards of residents. This plan was proposed by the German Socialist Unity Party, formulated by the German Economic Commission, and approved by the Soviet military government. It was promulgated and implemented in July of last year and will end in 1950. The plan stipulates that from 1948 to 1950, electricity production in the Soviet occupation zone will reach 15.55 billion kilowatt-hours (a kilowatt-hour is the work done by one kilowatt of electricity in one hour), an increase of 25 percent compared to 1947. Lignite production will reach 123 million tons, exceeding the 1936 level by 21.5 percent. Steel production will be 850,000 tons, rolled metal will be 650,000 tons, and iron production will be 860,000 tons. The total output of the chemical industry will increase by 46 percent compared to 1947, and liquid fuel production will increase by 29 percent. At the end of the plan, there will be 80,000 railway passenger cars, textile production will reach 138 million meters, shoes and socks will reach 20 million pairs, sugar will reach 750,000 tons, and the area for grain production will also increase.
