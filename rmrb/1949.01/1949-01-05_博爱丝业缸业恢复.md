　　The folk silk weaving and vat making industries in Bo'ai are recovering with government support. The vat kilns in Baishan Village and the silk weaving in more than twenty villages such as Qifang and Maying are all well-known. There was a local saying: "The bamboo gardens of Shangzhuang, the vats of Baishan, the girls of Qifang weave a lot of silk." The silk weaving in more than twenty villages, including Qifang and Maying, together with the vat kilns and bamboo industry in Baishan, are the three major specialties of Bo'ai.

　　According to surveys: During the prosperous period of silk weaving in Qifang and Maying villages from the 15th to the 19th year of the Republic of China, there were more than 340 silk weaving machines, more than 348 large and small Luodi machines, handkerchief machines, ribbon machines, and earthen silk machines, and more than 6,700 male and female workers. More than 300 jin of silk were used daily, producing more than 250 rolls of silk and a large number of other silk fabrics. At that time, the masses in these villages lived on this, and a large number of women in more than a dozen villages around Qifang also participated in silk reeling, which became one of their main sources of livelihood. Due to the development of the silk weaving industry, the market also prospered. At that time, there were nineteen large and small silk firms, purchasing raw materials from Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qinshui, and Lingchuan in Shanxi, and selling the finished products to Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhoucun in Shandong. After the "July 7th Incident", due to the looting and destruction by the enemy, traitors and bandits, and the disconnection of sales channels, the industry gradually declined, and all production stopped by the 32nd year. After Bo'ai was liberated for the second time last year, the industry gradually recovered after the democratic government called for and supported it, and repeatedly announced that household sideline businesses would not be taxed. At present, there are fifty ribbon weaving machines, eight large Luodi machines, and forty-three small Luodi machines, producing finished products from twenty-six jin of raw materials every day. More than 4,000 women and children in more than twenty villages, including Shangxia, Qicheng and Luqiao, have also resumed weaving nets (for women's hair), earning an average net profit of 20 yuan (new currency) per person per day. In order to better develop silk weaving production, the county federation of cooperatives, banks, and cooperation sections specially convened a forum for old silk weaving workers from various villages in early November to study and solve difficulties such as capital, technology, raw materials, and sales channels.

　　Baishan Village has 9,600 people. In the past, the annual grain harvest was only enough to feed them for three months, and the rest was supplemented by vat production. During the prosperous era before the war, there were 193 rotary vat wheels, more than 1,300 rotary workers, and an annual output of 770,000 sets of large vats, which could be exchanged for more than 12,000 large dan of grain. In addition to a part sold locally, most of the finished products were sold to Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang and other places via the Daoqing Road. Due to the development of the vat kilns, the masses in villages such as Shuiyun had 300 wheelbarrows to transport and sell large vats for a living. After the Anti-Japanese War, due to the destruction by the enemy and the famine in 1943, all production stopped. After liberation last year, the village was still in the guerrilla area, and the lives of the masses were unstable. In addition, there was a lack of fuel for firing kilns, and only thirteen small kilns produced goods. Now that Jiaozuo, Zhengzhou, and Kaifeng have been successively liberated, sales channels and coal have become much more convenient. In addition, after the policy has been straightened out, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has increased, and they are now actively raising shares to resume kiln operations. Thirteen wheels have already started turning vats and producing goods. The Bo'ai branch of the North China Bank has lent Qu Ke Rang and two other households 3,000 yuan (new currency) to help them resume operations. (Li Xicheng) (Taihang Xinhua Daily)

　　博爱丝业缸业恢复
    博爱民间的丝织业及制缸业，在政府扶持下，正恢复中。柏山村的缸窑及七方、马营等二十余村的丝织业，均很驰名，当地曾流行着“上庄的竹园柏山的缸，七方的闺女织绸多”的歌谣。七方、马营等二十余村的丝织业及柏山的缸窑和竹业，同为博爱三大特产。
    据调查：民国十五年至十九年，七方、马营两村丝织业发达时期，共有织绸机三百四十余张，大小箩底机、手帕机、带子机及土绸机三百四十八张，男女工人六千七百余，每日用丝三百余斤，日产二百五十余匹绸子及其他大批丝织品。当时这些村群众皆以此为生，七方周围之十余村的大批妇女也参加络丝，成为主要生活来源之一。由于丝织业的发达，市场也繁荣起来。当时共有大小丝行十九家，从山西晋城、阳城、沁水、陵川一带购买上原料，并将成品推销到上海、江苏各地及山东周村等地。“七七事变”后，由于敌人及汉奸、土匪抢掠、摧毁，销路断绝，日渐衰落，至卅二年全部停止。去年博爱二次解放后，经民主政府号召、扶持并一再宣布家庭副业不负担后，逐渐恢复。现已有织带子机五十张，大箩底机八张，小箩底机四十三张，每日出廿六斤原料的成品。上下、期城与芦桥等廿余村四千余妇女、小孩，也均恢复织网子（女人头上用），每天每人平均净赚洋廿元（新币）。该县县联社、银行、合作科为了更好的开展丝织业生产，特于十一月初，召开了各村老丝织工人座谈会，研究解决资金、技术、原料、销路等困难问题。
    柏山村九千六百口人，过去每年收粮只够三个月食用，余皆靠缸业生产补足。战前繁盛时代有一百九十三盘旋缸轮，旋匠工人一千三百余，年产大缸七十七万套，可换粮食一万二千余大石。出产成品除本地销售一部外，大部经道清路行销于开封、郑州、新乡等地。由于缸窑的发展，水运等村的群众，则有三百轮小车，以转运贩卖大缸为生。抗战后由于敌人的摧残，一九四三年灾荒，全部停业。去年解放后，该村仍处游击区，群众生活不安定，加以烧窑燃料缺乏，只有十三座小窑出货。现在焦作、郑州、开封相继解放，销路、煤炭均已大大便利，加以政策端正后，群众生产情绪提高，现正纷纷集股复业开窑。已有十三盘轮子，开始旋缸出货。华北银行博爱支行已贷给璩克让等两户大洋三千元（新币），帮助其复业。（李西成）（太行新华日报）
