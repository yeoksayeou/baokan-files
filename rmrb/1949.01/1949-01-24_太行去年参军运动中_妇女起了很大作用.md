(Taihang Electric Dispatch) In the successful completion of the recruitment of over ten thousand young men in Taihang last December, the broad masses of rural women played a significant role. Many outstanding women consciously educated their sons, persuaded their husbands, and mobilized their brothers to join the army, fully demonstrating the enhanced political awareness of the women. According to statistics from five districts in Hui County, among the 152 young men and adults who were persuaded by their relatives to sign up for the army, 45 were sent by their wives or mothers. In Chengguan, Gaoyi County, out of the 56 young men who volunteered to join the army, 8 were persuaded by their wives and 3 were sent by their mothers. Zhai Minglan, the chairwoman of the women's association in Majiagou, Xingtai, convinced her entire family and sent her husband to sign up. The mothers of Yang Qishan and Shen Baocheng, emancipated peasants in Licheng Zhengshe, were the first to sign up their sons to join the army at a mobilization meeting. Influenced by them, nine other young people also signed up on the spot. In consolidating the results of the military recruitment campaign, many women instructed their enlisted relatives at meetings or individually, saying: "Don't come back until Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown. Achieve final victory and make great contributions, and the whole family will be honored." At the welcoming meetings, the broad masses of women mutually agreed to ensure that they would take good care of the new and old military dependents who lacked labor. Women in Fengfeng, Ci County, also developed a plan to support the military and organized a group to慰问 the military. Duan Gaize, an old woman from Suizhuang, Huguan, kindly instructed the new soldiers, saying, "Children, I will take care of your wives. We will engage in mutual aid production together and ensure that you have no difficulties."

The reasons why women played such a significant role in this military recruitment campaign were: (1) Extensive and in-depth current affairs education was conducted, greatly enhancing the political awareness and support for the frontlines among the women. For example, in Gouwan, Changzhi, before mobilizing for recruitment, woman cadre Zhang Jingze, after attending winter school, not only changed her mind about calling her husband, who had planned to join the army, to come home, but also expressed her intention to send her son to join the army again, striving to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. (2) Female party members and activists (especially model military family women) consciously set an example and promoted the campaign in an organized manner, which was an important link in mobilizing the entire women's population to create a mass upsurge in educating their sons and persuading their husbands to join the army. When convening large-scale mobilization meetings for recruitment, the leaders of various counties and districts mostly absorbed a group of female party members and activists to participate in discussions and arrangements. At the cadre expansion meeting in Shahe, 85 female cadres and activists made plans to return to their villages to mobilize for recruitment. This military recruitment campaign once again proved the great role of mobilizing women. At the beginning of Xiliao City, She County, the campaign stagnated because the leaders did not mobilize the women to work with the men to mobilize for return to the ranks. After timely correction, the women organized to persuade the families of soldiers in the villages, and in one day they persuaded six people to volunteer to return to the ranks. At the same time, through this military recruitment campaign, the awareness of women and their social and family status have been enhanced throughout the region.

### 太行去年参军运动中　妇女起了很大作用

　　太行去年参军运动中
  　妇女起了很大作用
    【太行电】太行去年十二月胜利完成万余青壮参军运动中，全区广大农村妇女起了很大作用。不少优秀妇女，真正自觉地教子劝郎及动员哥弟参军，充分显示了妇女群众政治觉悟的提高。据辉县五个区统计，劝送亲人报名入伍的一百五十二个青壮中，妻送郎、母送子的有四十五人。高邑城关自报参军的青壮年五十六名，其中即有八个妻劝郎。三个母送子。邢台马家沟妇女主席翟明兰说通了全家人的思想，送夫报了名。黎城正社翻身农民杨起善、申保成的母亲，在动员大会上首先报名送子参军，在她俩影响下，九个青年亦当场报名。在巩固参军运动成果中，不少妇女在大会或个别嘱咐其入伍的亲人说：“不打倒蒋介石不要回来，最后胜利立大功，全家都光荣。”而广大妇女在欢送大会上互订公约时，都表示保证好好照顾没劳力的新旧军属。磁县峰峰妇女并订好优军计划，组织了优军慰问团。壶关睢庄老太太段改则亲切的嘱咐新战士说“孩子们，你们的媳妇我照顾，俺们一块互助生产，保证没困难”。
    此次参军运动中妇女所以起了巨大作用的原因：（一）进行了广泛和深入的时事宣传教育，使妇女群众的政治觉悟与支前热情大大提高。如长治狗湾在动员参军前，妇女干部张景则经过上冬学，不但转变打算叫自己参了军的男人回家的想法，并表示要送子再参军，争取早一天打倒蒋介石。（二）女党员干部积极分子（特别是模范军属妇女）自觉的以身作则，有组织的推动，这是发动整个妇女掀起群众性的教子劝夫参军热潮的重要一环。各县、区领导上，在召开大规模的动员参军会时，大部分均吸收了一批妇女党员干部积极分子参加讨论布置。沙河扩干会上，八十五位妇女干部积极分子，订了回村动员参军归队的计划。此次参军运动中，又一次证明发动妇女的伟大作用。涉县西辽城开始由于领导上没有发动妇女与男人协同一齐动员归队，结果运动停滞不前，经及时纠正后，妇女即有组织的劝说在乡军人家庭，一天即说服六人自报归队。同时，全区经过此次参军运动，妇女觉悟及其社会与家庭地位有了提高。
