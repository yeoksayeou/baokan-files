Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: The people of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark oppose establishing any form of reactionary bloc or joining the "North Atlantic Alliance" in Northern Europe. According to a TASS report: The Swedish Communist Party is scheduled to launch a nationwide movement for peace and national independence on the 20th of this month. The organizational secretary of the Swedish Communist Party, Tel, declared in an interview with the "Ny Dag" reporter that the main purpose of this movement is to unite progressive elements in the country to oppose Sweden's accession to the "Atlantic Pact," oppose the establishment of a Scandinavian military bloc, oppose the new war provocateurs in the United States, and strive for world peace and freedom. Another purpose of the movement is to spread the truth about the Soviet Union and its peaceful foreign policy among the Swedish people. Swedish democratic youth and women's organizations will participate in this movement. The Norwegian "People's Anti-War Movement" group protested to the government, stating: "We demand that the government take into account the will of the people when considering Norway's participation in the establishment of any bloc." The Danish Communist Party's organ, "Land og Folk," sharply condemned attempts to drag Denmark into an anti-Soviet aggressive bloc. The newspaper stated: No matter what name this bloc is called, whether it is a branch of the Atlantic Group in Northern Europe or a "Nordic" group connected to the Atlantic Group, it is brewing a dark future for us.

Note: The prime ministers, foreign ministers, and defense ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark held a secret meeting in Karlstad, Sweden, on the 5th and 6th of this month to discuss the Scandinavian countries' response to the invitation to join the North Atlantic Alliance. The meeting was initiated by Norway. Due to differences of opinion among the participating countries on the form of the bloc to be formed, the Soviet Red Star newspaper pointed out that the meeting apparently had not yet adopted any definite resolutions. However, these differences were not differences in principle, but only related to how to adopt the "most skillful form."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: Dianshe [Telegraphic News Agency] Stockholm, January 17th: Communist leaders of Scandinavian countries wrote articles in the Swedish "Ny Dag" newspaper on the tasks of the struggle for peace and national independence in 1949. The chairman of the Danish Communist Party, Larsen, said: 1949 will be a decisive year for Denmark in terms of diplomatic, political, and military direction. Before the war, the Communist Party had demanded effective measures against Hitler's Germany. During the war, the Communist Party led the freedom movement. After the war, they were the only party to demand a defense and foreign policy suitable for the interests of the Danish people.

The chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, Lovrin, declared on behalf of the Norwegian Communist Party: Today, the struggle for peace is closely linked with the struggle for national freedom and the struggle for socialism. Joining the Western bloc would mean the death and destruction of our country. The current task is to mobilize the forces of peace and coordinate them with each other.

Swedish Communist Party member of parliament, Hague, believes that if the people defend their national independence and fight back against war propaganda and the arms policy, they will be able to stop the war plans.

　　瑞典挪威丹麦三国人民
  　反对参加“北大西洋联盟”
    北欧各国共产党号召争取和平和独立
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】瑞典、挪威、丹麦三国人民，反对在北欧建立任何形式的反动集团或参加“北大西洋联盟”。据塔斯社报导：瑞典共产党定于本月二十日发动全国性的争取和平与国家独立的运动。瑞共组织书记泰尔在接见“尼·达格”报记者时宣称：这一运动的主要目的，是团结国内进步分子反对瑞典加入“大西洋公约”，反对建立斯堪的纳维亚军事集团，反对美国新战争挑拨者，争取世界的和平与自由。运动的另一目的，是在瑞典人民中间传播苏联及其和平外交政策的真象。瑞典民主青年和妇女组织将参加这一运动。挪威“人民反战运动”团体向政府提出抗议称：“我们要求政府在考虑挪威参加建立任何集团的问题时，应考虑到人民的意志。”丹麦共产党机关报“人民园地”报尖锐谴责把丹麦卷入反苏侵略集团的企图。该报称：不管这个集团叫作什么名字，是大西洋集团在北欧设的分号也好，是和大西洋集团有联系的“北方”集团也好，它都是为我们孕育着黑暗的前途。
    按：瑞典、挪威，丹麦三国总理、外长与国防部长，曾于本月五六两日在瑞境卡尔斯塔德举行秘密的会议，讨论斯堪的纳维亚国家对参加北大西洋联盟之邀请的答复问题。会议由挪威发起。由于参加各国对组成何种形式的集团意见分歧，据苏联红星报指出：会议显然尚未采取任何确定的决议，但是，这种分歧并不是原则上的分歧，只是关系到如何采取“最巧妙形式”而已。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】电通社斯德哥尔摩十七日讯：斯堪的纳维亚各国共产党领袖，在瑞典“尼·达格”报上著文论述一九四九年争取和平与国家独立的斗争的任务。丹麦共产党主席拉荪说：一九四九年将是丹麦在外交、政治和军事方向上有着决定性的一年。在战争以前，共产党曾要求采取反对希特勒德国的有效措施。在战争期间，共产党领导着自由运动。在战后，他们是要求适合于丹麦人民利益的防务和外交政策的唯一政党。
    挪威共产党主席洛夫林代表挪威共产党宣称：今天，争和平的斗争是与争国家自由和争社会主义的斗争密切地结合在一起的。参加西方集团将意味着我们国家的死亡和毁灭。目前的任务是发动和平的力量并使之互相配合。
    瑞典共产党议员海格相信，如果人民守卫他们的国家独立并反击战争宣传及军备政策，他们就能够阻止战争计划。
