　　【Taiyue Telegram】In Gancaotan Village, Tunliu Third District, landlords and rich peasants created sectarian struggles to conceal themselves. This was not thoroughly resolved until this time, during the conclusion of land reform and party rectification. Gancaotan has a total of fifty households, of which sixteen are from Shandong. In 1936, the feudal rich peasant Zhang Hongbing controlled the village affairs. In order to facilitate the rule over the masses, he used the feudal village power to exploit the localism of the native people, excluded the people from Shandong, and did not allow them to join the cooperative, using this to win over the locals. At that time, the people from Shandong had no security in the village: crops were stolen, and people were beaten and scolded, and the cooperative did not care. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, this kind of sectarian struggle was used by landlords and rich peasants to protect their own feudal property. The landlord Wang San said to the Shandong masses: "The locals are bullying us Shandong people again, and they are fighting against me again, we have to think of a way!" In this way, he ostensibly distributed his property to several Shandong households and ran away himself. In the autumn of 1946, the local rich peasant Zhang Hongbing infiltrated the party, served as the branch secretary, and, together with the militia committee director Guo Cheng'er and instructor Zhao Dengyun, used the excuse that the Shandong people were harboring the landlord Wang San. They struggled against four middle-peasant households and three poor-peasant households, including Cui Mingdao and Jia Wuzhen, driving them out of their homes, and forced the middle peasant Li Zhonggui to hang himself. The middle peasant Chen Liyou was beaten half to death. Among the sixteen Shandong households, seven were struggled against, and the remaining nine were only allowed to attend general mass meetings, not allowed to participate in meetings discussing the struggle. Zhang Hongbing was obviously a rich peasant, with two laborers in his family, employing three long-term workers and one cook, as well as ten hectares of land. Yet, he was classified as a middle peasant and was given fifteen piculs and one dou of grain and some clothing and other gains in the struggle. Of the six party members in the branch, three were from Shandong. Every time they met, they were filled with hatred and did not say a word. Sometimes, when important meetings were held (such as who to struggle against, how to struggle), they were not informed, and the decisions were made by local party members. This made it easier for the landlord Wang San to provoke sectarian struggles and oppose land reform. He said to the Shandong people: "This is not about turning the poor people over, this is about fighting the Shandong people and turning the local people over! Sooner or later, we will get our revenge!" The Shandong masses were greatly deceived by the landlord Wang San and inadvertently sheltered the landlord Wang San. During the rectification and struggle last spring, although Zhang Hongbing was transferred out to work, when resolving this issue, only the seven Shandong households who were wrongly struggled against were compensated. The leadership announced: "Sectarian struggles are not allowed in the future, whoever causes trouble is breaking the law!" The feudal aspects were still not exposed. It was not until this time, during the conclusion of land reform combined with party rectification, that party members boldly exposed Zhang Hongbing and Wang San for mutually creating sectarian struggles between locals and Shandong people. The feudal aspects were not thoroughly fought, and they were even used to wrongly struggle against middle peasants, so that a small number of poor peasants and farm laborers did not turn over, and various tasks could not be carried out well. On the basis of improving the class consciousness of party members, the local and Shandong party members both made self-criticisms. First, the sectarian struggle was ideologically cleared up in the branch, and then work was carried out among the masses. The Shandong party members went to the Shandong masses, the locals went to the local masses, and individual persuasion was carried out with the main troublemakers, while propaganda was carried out to the general masses, so that both sides realized: After so many years of sectarianism, they were all used by the landlords and rich peasants. It was truly a case of "when the snipe and clam grapple, the fisherman benefits." Subsequently, meetings of poor peasants and farm laborers, new middle peasants, and mass meetings were held successively, where party members conducted self-criticism, which was then discussed by the masses. Finally, the masses concluded: "Sectarianism only benefits the rich peasant Zhang Hongbing and the landlord Wang San, and it makes the poor peasants and farm laborers suffer and wrongly struggles against middle peasants." The Shandong people understood: "It was wrong to protect Wang San." The locals recognized: "It was wrong to protect Zhang Hongbing and wrongly struggle against middle and poor peasants." In this way, the sectarian problem was completely resolved. Individual elements with radical emotions, although they said some strange things, were not supported by others, and after persuasion and education, they also changed.

　　结束土改中揭破封建统治阴谋
  　甘草滩消除宗派对立
    【太岳电】屯留三区甘草滩村地主富农制造宗派斗争，以隐藏自己，直到这次结束土改与整党中，才得到彻底解决。甘草滩共有五十户人家，其中十六户是山东人。民国二十五年时，封建富农张鸿丙掌握着村社大权。他为了便利统治群众，就以封建社权为名，利用本地人的地方观念，排斥山东人，不让山东人入社，拿这来争取本地人。那时闹的山东人在村里没保障：庄稼被偷窃了，人被打骂了，社里都不管。抗战后，这种宗派斗争就被地主富农利用来保护自己的封建财产。地主王三对山东群众说：“本地人又欺负咱山东人了，人家又斗争我，咱得想个办法呀！”这样，他把财产假分散给几户山东人，自己偷跑了。到一九四六年秋后，本地富农张鸿丙混入党内，担任了支部书记，与武委会主任郭成二、指导员赵登云等，借口山东人包庇了地主王三，便将崔明道、贾五真等四户中农和三户贫农都斗得扫地出门了，把中农李中贵逼的上吊死了，中农陈立有被打的半死不活。十六户山东人中，便斗争了七户，其余九户只让参加一般的群众会，不让参加讨论斗争的会议。张鸿丙很明显的是富农，家里有两个劳动力，用着三个长工，一个做饭的，还有十顷来地；却划成了中农成份，并在斗争中给他分了十五石一斗粮食和一些衣服等果实。支部里六个党员，有三个山东的，每次开会都是装着满肚子恨气，一言不发。有时候开一些重要会议（如斗争谁、如何斗争），都不让他们知道，都由本地的党员决定。这样，更便利了地主王三来挑拨宗派斗争，反对土地改革。他对山东人说：“这不是叫穷人翻身，这是斗了山东人，叫本地人翻身啦！这口气迟早总得出一出啦！”山东群众上了地主王三的大当，无意中就包庇了地主王三。去春纠斗中，虽然张鸿丙调出外面工作，但解决这一问题时，只是对山东的七户误斗中、贫农作了补偿，由领导上宣布了一下：“以后不准闹宗派斗争，谁闹谁犯法！”对封建仍没揭露。直到这次结束土改结合整党工作中，党员才大胆的揭露了张鸿丙、王三互相制造本地人和山东人的宗派斗争，封建没斗彻底，还被他们利用误斗了中农，使少数贫雇农没有翻身，各种工作都不能很好的进行。在党员的阶级觉悟提高的基础上，党员中的本地人与山东人，双方都作了检讨。首先在支部里对宗派斗争从思想上作了清算，然后到群众中进行工作。党员中的山东人到山东群众中去，本地人到本地群众中去，并找主要的闹事人进行个别说服，同时进行对一般群众的宣传，使双方群众都认识到：闹了好多年宗派，都是被地富利用了，真是“鹬蚌相争，渔人得利。”接着先后召开雇贫、新中农会和群众大会，由党员进行自我检讨，再经群众讨论。最后群众得出结论说：“闹宗派就是便宜了富农张鸿丙和地主王三，苦了贫雇农和误斗中农。”山东人想通了：“包庇王三是错误的。”本地人认识了：“包庇张鸿丙，误斗了中、贫农是错误的。”这样，宗派问题得到了彻底的解决。个别有偏激情绪的分子，虽说了一些怪话，但因得不到别人附和，经过说服教育，也有了转变。
