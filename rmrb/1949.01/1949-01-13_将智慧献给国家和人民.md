This newspaper has published news of scientific inventions and technological improvements by workers, peasants, technicians, and specialists hundreds of times, and such news is increasing day by day. This phenomenon did not exist and was unimaginable in the old society, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Why? For example, Yin Huafeng, a resident of Xingtai City, is fifty years old. In the past, he devoted himself to creating a hydroelectric generator, but he suffered from a lack of funds for testing and had to give up when he had no other choice. Once Xingtai was liberated, with the assistance of the democratic government, he had all the conditions for experimentation, and as a result, the experiment was successful. Isn't this very obvious? In the old society, under the rule of the Kuomintang, even if someone wanted to engage in scientific invention and technological improvement, they could only suffer the same fate as Yin Huafeng in the past. Who knows how many people's brains were exhausted to no avail. Now it is different. In the liberated areas, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, workers have become masters, peasants have land, and scientists and specialists have all the conditions for invention and creation. People not only have the heart to produce, but also the heart to vigorously develop production, and they contribute all their efforts with infinite enthusiasm and wisdom. What is particularly worth mentioning is that our inventions and creations are not only able to be developed by a few technicians and experts with their special skills and expertise, but also have the characteristics of being mass-based and collective. This feature unfolds an infinitely bright prospect for our scientific invention and technological improvement work. Our tens of thousands of workers, peasants, and all manual and mental laborers have become or are becoming heroes of scientific invention and technological improvement. They are conducting various research experiments and improvements in various production and construction undertakings such as industry and mining, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, transportation, and medicine, and they will surely achieve more amazing results. In the past, we have always rewarded scientific and technological inventions and improvements, but most of the rewards were given for sporadic discoveries, and there was a lack of planned and active advocacy. Today, this newspaper publishes the "Provisional Regulations on the Award of Scientific Inventions and Technological Improvements in the North China Region" promulgated by the North China People's Government, which is an active call and a great encouragement. We hope that all workers, peasants, technicians, specialists, and all manual and mental laborers will actively respond to this call and dedicate our wisdom to our production and construction cause, to our country and our people!

### 将智慧献给国家和人民

专栏：短论

　　将智慧献给国家和人民
    本报曾百十次地登载过工人、农民、技师、专门家的科学发明与改进技术的新闻，而且这种新闻正在与日俱增着。这种现象，在旧社会，在国民党统治区是没有的，也是不可想象的。为什么？举个例子：邢台市市民尹华丰，五十岁了，他过去专心致意想创造水力发电机，但苦于无资金试验，只得没有办法时就放下。当邢台一经解放，他在民主政府协助下，有了试验的各种条件，结果试验成功。这难道还不很明显吗？在旧社会，在国民党统治下，纵使有人想从事科学发明与改进技术，也只能遭受象过去的尹华丰同样的厄运，不知道有多少人的脑力被绞尽而徒劳无功。现在不同了，在解放区，在共产党、民主政府领导下，工人成了主人，农民有了土地，科学家、专门家有了一切发明创造的条件，人们不但有心生产，而且有心大力发展生产，他们用无限热忱与无限智慧来贡献自己的一切。特别值得提出的，我们的发明与创造，不仅只是少数技师、专家能发挥他们的特技与专长，而且是带有群众性与集体性的特点的，这一特点，为我们的科学发明与技术改进工作展开了无限光辉的远景，我们成千成万的工人、农民以及一切体力、脑力劳动者，都成为或者正在成为科学发明与技术改进的英雄，他们对工矿、农林、畜牧、水利、交通、医药各生产建设事业，都在进行各种研究试验与改进，他们一定会获得更惊人的成绩。过去我们一向是奖励科学技术的发明与改进的，但大部是零星发现了，才奖励的，缺乏有计划的积极的倡导，今日本报发表华北人民政府颁布的“华北区奖励科学发明及技术改进暂行办法条例”，乃是一个积极的号召，是一种莫大的鼓励，我们希望一切工人、农民、技师、专门家及一切体力、脑力劳动人民，积极响应这个号召，将我们的智慧献给我们的生产建设事业，献给我们的国家和人民！
