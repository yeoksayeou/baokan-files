Several Problems in Mass Literary and Artistic Creation
    Ruan Zhangjing

    The mass-based literary and artistic activities in the Taihang area have a fairly broad foundation historically. Over the past few years, many excellent rural theatrical troupes and quite a few good mass creations have emerged, playing a significant role in the war, production, and land reform. On July 7th of this year, the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee issued a notice regarding creation, and comrades who love and are enthusiastic about the mass literary and artistic movement in various places responded warmly to the Party's call. More than 150 people participated in this project, creating a massive achievement of over 400,000 words (more than 50 pieces of quick-patter rhymes and ballads, and more than 40 plays) in more than two months. The number of works not submitted for review and the number of people involved are estimated to be even greater. The vast majority of the works relatively richly and realistically reflect the current rural situation in our district this year. The characteristics of this creative movement are reflected in its mass character, collectivity, and non-amateur nature. There is no doubt that this movement proves that the mass literature and art in our district has a considerable solid strength, and a very valuable group of comrades with practical experience and writing ability. Most of the works strongly want to answer certain questions in reality, and the forms of the works are all popular forms such as quick-patter rhymes, ballads, and Yangko dances that are most easily accepted by the masses. The structure of each work adopts a new and more scientific script form. The past method of writing like opening a ledger is gone. Moreover, many plays are equipped with musical scores. Although in music, it is still limited to random borrowing and has not been able to give new life and form in music based on the new life, this is indeed a great development. These are all aspects of achievements that must be affirmed. But at the same time, we also see that there are still some urgent problems to be solved in the current mass literary and artistic creation, which are put forward for comrades participating in this movement to study and refer to.

    I. The Selection and Handling of Themes

    Many works, on the one hand, more or less reflect real life; but on the other hand, they are mostly isolated, fragmented, and historically separated methods of one-sided reflection. The selection of themes and the grasp of the Party's line and policies are very insufficient; and the handling of subject matter takes a photographic-like pure objective enumeration of phenomena, lacking Marxist-Leninist criticism and analysis, and is politically and ideologically very weak. For example, regarding works on correcting deviations, most of them simply and excessively emphasize the negative factors arising from "leftist" adventurism. In order to express "left," a rogue-like character must be used as a representative of the poor and hired peasants, who "eats the food of struggle," "does not work," and is "not upright," etc., making people hate and detest him when they see him. And the great achievements of eliminating feudalism and land reform, and the revolutionary role of the poor and hired peasants in this great movement, are diluted, neglected, or even negated invisibly. Of course, infringing on the middle peasants is wrong and not allowed, so we must engage in self-criticism and correct it. But we have reflected a lot on the negative phenomena of "left," while the positive purpose—uniting production after correcting deviations, and the correct spirit of self-criticism—is very unspecific and lacks power.

    Works that choose the theme of democratic Party rectification also lack critical analysis based on the Party's line and policies. Most still excessively and incompletely emphasize the impure parts of Party member cadres: corruption, degeneration, multiple occupations, impure work style, and impure thinking. The erroneous practices of certain work teams in implementing the Party rectification policy, such as the "poor peasant line" and "kicking away the old foundation," are incorrectly and stubbornly written as the errors of rural branches. Therefore, the negative and dark things of Party member cadres are exaggerated, while the victories over the Japanese invaders, the victorious carrying out of the great patriotic war, the elimination of feudalism, and the leadership of the production movement, which should not be forgotten in the spirit of the entire work, are very vague or non-existent. This can easily make people doubt: Who led the unprecedented great changes in the liberated area countryside, and where did they come from? Literary and artistic works must distinguish between what is essential and major and what is non-essential and secondary in social life phenomena. Therefore, criticizing the shortcomings and errors in our work is very necessary, and it certainly does not mean asking me to only say good things and not bad things, and to only report good news and not bad news. But it should be affirmed: These are shortcomings or errors in the course of progress, and we are conducting the struggle with enthusiasm and seriousness, instead of just staring at the erroneous phenomena and nagging endlessly. This is the Marxist-Leninist realistic method of literary and artistic creation, which is the watershed from the pure objectivism of the petty bourgeoisie, which only diagnoses the illness but does not prescribe the medicine, in the literary and artistic creation method. This position and purpose must be clear.

    II. The Issue of Party Leadership

    In hundreds of thousands of words of works, we cannot clearly see the fundamental reason why we can overcome everything, which is the leadership of the Communist Party. This is a problem that is seen every day and is ignored by many people. Many literary and artistic works in the past have ignored this point, and today it has not been noticed by everyone.

    Many works have written a "worker" and attempted to present this worker as a representative of the Party, but almost instead wrote him as a bureaucratic official. In the work, it is impossible to see that he represents the fighting Communist Party. When the author cannot continue writing about the problems that the masses have encountered and obstacles occur, the worker comes out in time to "rescue": reciting a few policy clauses, saying a few Party jargon and ready-made slogans and political idioms, and then successfully solving the problem. It is very difficult to see how he goes deep into understanding the masses' thoughts, carries out hard work among the masses, and concretely embodies the Party's policies and propositions. At the same time, it is also rare to see the fact that the rural branch, which has been tested by years of severe struggle, leads the masses' struggle.

    The reason why the Chinese people were able to turn themselves over is because of the leadership of the vanguard of the proletariat, the Communist Party. This is a truth that cannot be ignored.

    III. Two Biases in Performance Techniques

    Many works, in terms of performance techniques, are either rigid and dry political preaching that is separated from the characters' stories, thoughts, and feelings, or the accumulation of materials that is divorced from policy guidance. Understanding and observation of the lives of the masses in the real countryside are not profound enough, and the soul of the people cannot be understood from all the states, thoughts, feelings, and lifestyles caused by the great revolutionary war era. Therefore, the characters portrayed are flat and not lively. Political thoughts cannot be dissolved and concentrated from the actions of the characters and stories, and can only be solved in rigid and dry political preaching. This is the reason why many works are mixed with lengthy political speeches. In addition, when the author cannot write new revolutionary characters, he writes out of thin air a fourteen or fifteen-year-old child who is smart, clever, lively, and mischievous, who knows everything about astronomy, geography, general lines, and general policies, from rural to urban areas, and preaches on the stage as an ideal new character. It is possible for a child to be innocent, pure, and easy to believe in the truth, but it is too illusory to understand everything. However, this formalism has become an epidemic, from the past Taihang Theatre Troupe, People's Theatre Troupe to the special county theatre troupe, especially in this work, there are many such "little geniuses" and "little politicians." This greatly reduces the authenticity. Art without authenticity will not have life.

    There are also many works that completely or more or less do not analyze, critically analyze, and concentrate on various events that occur objectively under the guidance of political, ideological, and policy thoughts, but simply move many performance phenomena to paper as they are. Everything is talked about, but nothing is talked about thoroughly. Instead of class analysis and concentration of performance from various classes, types of characters, types of cadres, and types of masses, there are all kinds of characters, but no character has personality, and the work itself lacks story. And all of this is extremely important in the art of drama.

    Literary and artistic works want to solve many themes at the same time, which is very difficult. This makes many works a waste of effort. All-encompassing and lengthy, it frustrates the good intention of answering certain questions in real life.

    Artistic works are required to have vivid and lively infectious power; rigid political preaching is not easy to produce good results. Not from the Marxist-Leninist guided realistic creative method, concentrated typical performance, will make the work weak.

    IV. Performance of the Forward and Backward Sides; Handling of Abundant Humor and Vulgar and Low-Level Thoughts

    Many authors have not correctly solved the above-mentioned problems. Whenever they write about dark and backward things, they are often interested and vivid; while for bright and forward things, they are as boring and tasteless as chewed cotton. For example, works against superstition are almost entirely bizarre legends. Daydreams of seeing ghosts and making monsters are written vividly and seriously, which is quite prominent, giving people a sense of gloomy wind and ghostly shadows. The themes of these works all come from these two aspects: one is historical legendary stories, such as "The River God Marrying a Wife," "Guan Gong Conquering Zhou Cang," "Zhou Cang Teasing Guanyin," etc.; the other is the activities of witches in rural areas, how to cast spells to catch ghosts, summon souls to cure diseases, and accidentally kill people, and finally the confession of the wizard, etc., which are all the same and have minor differences. Generally, most of the time and space is used to write these, and finally a mouse tail is left to expose it, and this tail is ended in the form of a joke. This type of work accounts for the most of all works. This also shows that superstition is a problem that urgently needs to be solved in the real countryside. It also shows that the author is quite interested in these absurd and bizarre stories. However, such a writing method, in today's rural masses where scientific knowledge is not high, its positive role is far less than the side effects. After the People's Theatre Troupe performed "The Red Shoes Fairy," many children and service personnel were so scared that they did not dare to go to the toilet.

    Certain works have vulgar and low-level thoughts. In order to make the audience laugh, an unnecessary gag that has nothing to do with the play is added for no reason. For example, a mother and daughter are joking to their heart's content while fleeing from the enemy's "mopping up." The war is so serious and tense, where does this leisure come from? And the relationship between mother and daughter in rural areas is also unnatural. In particular, the problem of sexuality is expressed nakedly on the stage, which is very low-level. Writing about the enemy's insults to women cannot be written positively, otherwise it will inevitably make some audiences burst into laughter and will never enhance the masses' common hatred against the enemy. In dramatic art, the more rude the insult, the more seriously it must be dealt with. Proletarian literature and art require a fighting, lofty, and healthy cultural life, and must never extend to the vulgar, corrupt, and degenerate consciousness of jokes. Especially in drama, we must pay attention to the seriousness of art.

    V. Language and Form

    Many works are written very well in terms of language and form. In terms of lyrics, they have learned and absorbed the description method, metaphor method, and contrast method in folk songs, and adopted the poetic form that is loved by the masses. However, there are also very narrow local dialects (local dialects are completely necessary in local performances, but for a work, at least there should be a considerable common language in the whole region, otherwise the promotion of the work will be limited), and there are also hard sets of vulgar slang. Some works are written in Chinese form, but mixed with semi-Chinese and semi-Western awkward Europeanized language, which makes the work unharmonious in tone, and when read to the masses, it feels unfamiliar. Popular works should make the masses able to understand, and popular poetry, I think, must be able to be easily sung.

    Some works (dramas) have dramatic stereotyped writing and formalism. The ending must be a grand chorus or a grand unison, and it must be a Yangko dance, and the lyrics must be "Chairman Mao is like a red light" and "The Communist Party is a savior," etc. The development of the story does not necessarily have to be a grand chorus, a grand Yangko interspersed dance in the end; Chairman Mao and the Party should be praised, but we should take the content and language form that are closely related to the masses to praise, and without this, it will be unnatural.

    VI. Historical Drama Creation in the Form of Old Drama

    Authors generally do not have enough understanding and research on historical materials, lack a correct historical view, and some have distorted history (if it is to correct the history distorted by the ruling class in the past with historical materialism, it is possible and should be). In writing, it is still limited to copying in form. Writing about historical materials of peasant uprisings is exactly the same as the appearance of other emperors and generals on the stage, only changing the name. It cannot write out the historical truth and cause and effect. And there are very unreasonable modern languages: such as "oppose imperialism," "liberate the people," "anti-feudalism" and other modern political struggle slogans, which are inappropriate. We cannot forcibly pull historical dead people to live now, and we cannot push the present into the pile of bones hundreds of years ago. We write historical dramas to learn lessons from history, not to modify it with the current political struggle, and it cannot be modified.

    In summary, it can be seen that we do not understand the Party's line and policies, our theoretical level is still very poor, and the realistic method of creation is not familiar or lacks a clear understanding. Therefore, some of our works have failed to reach a politically and ideologically lofty and rich state. There are also many technical and experience problems (such as lack of stage experience, it is difficult to create dramas, but it can be overcome by writing a few more times). I think improving the level of political theory is fundamental, because if you engage in literary and artistic creation, if you do not understand and study the Party's line and policies, it is difficult to correctly reflect the fundamental reasons for the people's victory.

    If it is regarded as a mass-based, amateur literary and artistic creation, the achievements are certain and worthy of praise. But if it is to be regarded as a work that is provided for the masses to watch or listen to, it needs to be brought up, because the audience does not care whether you are mass-based or not, amateur or non-amateur, he directly feels complete or incomplete from the performance or singing of the work.

    The problems raised above are not necessarily correct, but only the feelings are put forward as a piece of brick to attract jade for the comrades participating in the creation to study this problem together.

　　群众文艺创作上的几个问题
    阮章竞
    太行区群众性的文艺活动，从历史上说，是有相当广泛基础的。数年来，出现了不少较优良的农村剧团和不少较好的群众创作，对战争、生产、土改，都起了很大的作用。今年七月七日，区党委宣传部发出了关于创作的通知，各地爱好和热心群众文艺运动的同志，热烈地响应了党的号召，一百五十余人参加了这个工程，两个多月时间，创作了四十多万字（五十余件快板和鼓词，四十多个剧作）的巨大成绩。而作品未送来审查的数目和人数，估计还很多。绝大多数作品，都比较丰富地，现实地反映了今年本区农村的现实情况。这一次创作运动的特点，表现在群众性、集体性和非业余性上。毫无疑义，从这次运动证明，本区的群众文艺有相当雄厚的力量，有很宝贵的一大批有实际经验与写作能力的同志。大多数作品，都强烈地想回答现实中某些问题，而作品的形式又都是采取了为群众所最容易接受的快板鼓词和秧歌剧等通俗形式，每个作品的结构，都采取了新的较科学的剧本形式，象过去开流水帐本式的写法，都不见了。而且不少剧作，都配有曲谱。虽然在音乐上，还只限在东拉西套，还没能够根据新的生活，在音乐上付以新的生命与形式，但这确是一个很大的发展。这些都是必须肯定的成绩的一面。但同时也看到目前群众文艺创作上，还或多或少存在着若干急待解决的问题，兹提出来作为参加这次运动的同志研究参考。
    一、主题的选择和处理
    许多作品，一方面是或多或少反映了现实生活；但另一方面又大都是孤立地、片断地、割裂历史地片面反映的方法。主题的选择，对党的路线和政策的掌握很不够；而处理题材，又采取了照像似的纯客观的现象罗列，缺乏马列主义的批判分析，政治上思想上都很贫弱。比方关于纠偏的作品，大都单纯地、过份地强调因左倾冒险主义而产生的消极因素，为了表现“左”，一定要一个二流子式的人物，作为贫雇阶级的代表，“吃斗争饭”，“不劳动”，“不正派”等等，使人看了可恨可憎。而对于消灭封建，土地改革的伟大成果，和贫雇农在这一伟大运动中的革命作用，则被冲淡，或忽略，甚至无形中否定了。当然，侵犯了中农，是错误的，不许可的，所以要自我批评，要纠正过来。但我们在左的消极现象方面，反映的倒不少，而积极的目的——纠正偏向后团结生产，和正确的自我批评精神，则十分不具体，没力量。
    选择民主整党主题的作品，同样缺乏根据党的路线政策，加以批判分析。多数还是过份地、不全面地强调了党员干部的不纯部分：贪污、腐化、多占，作风不纯、思想不纯。把某些工作组在执行整党政策中的“贫雇路线”，“踢开老基础”的错误作法，不正确地、固执地写成是农村支部的错误。因此就夸大了党员干部的消极和黑暗的东西，而对于战胜日寇，胜利地进行了伟大的爱国战争，消灭封建，领导生产运动，这些不应该在整个作品精神中忘记的东西，都很含糊，或者没有。这就很能使人怀疑：解放区农村史无前例的伟大变革，是谁领导的，从何而来的？文艺作品对社会生活现象，必须分清：什么问题是本质的，主要的；什么问题是非本质的，次要的。因此，批判我们工作中的缺点和错误，是十分需要的，绝不是叫我光说好不说坏，报喜不报忧。但应肯定：这是前进中的缺点或错误，我们是在热情与严肃的进行斗争，而不是眼巴巴地对着错误现象，呶呶不休。这是马列主义的现实主义的文艺创作方法，它是和小资产阶级看病不开方的纯客观主义的文艺创作方法的分水岭。这一立场和目的性必须明确。
    二、党的领导问题
    在数十万字的作品中，不能明显地看出我们所以能战胜一切的根本原因，是有共产党的领导，这是一个天天在看，又为很多人所熟视无睹的问题。过去很多文艺作品忽略了这一点，今天也未被大家所注意。
    不少作品，都曾写了一个“工作员”，又都企图把这个工作员作为党的代表来出现的，但差不多反而写成了个官僚主义分子，在作品中，看不出他是代表战斗的共产党的。当作者在写群众发生问题写不下去发生障碍的时候，工作员就应时的出来“救驾”了：背诵几句政策条文，说两句党八股和现成的口号和政治惯语，就算胜利地解决了问题，很不容易看见他如何去深入了解群众思想，在群众中进行艰苦工作，具体的体现党的政策与主张。同时也很少看到：经过多年严重斗争考验的农村支部，如何领导群众斗争的事实。
    中国人民所以能翻身，是因有无产阶级的先锋队共产党的领导，这是不许可忽略的真理。
    三、表现手法的两种偏向
    很多作品，在表现手法上，不是脱离人物故事思想感情的生硬的、干巴巴的政治说教，就是离开政策指导的材料堆积。对现实农村群众的生活，了解和观察不深刻，不能从伟大的革命战争时代所引起的一切状态、思想感情、生活方式等等去洞悉人民的灵魂。所以表现的人物，都是平板而不生动。政治思想，又不能从人物、故事的行动中溶化集中表现，只能在生硬干枯的政治说教中来求解决，不少作品夹杂着长篇大论的政治训话，原因就在这里。另外是当作者无法写出新的革命的人物时，就无中生有地，写一个十四五岁的，聪明玲俐，活泼捣蛋的小孩子，上通天文，下晓地理，总路线总政策，从农村到城市，什么都懂、吱吱哇哇在舞台上现身说法，作为剧中的理想新人物。一个小孩，天真纯洁，易信真理是可以的，什么都了解就太虚幻。可是这个公式主义，已变成流行病，从过去的太行剧团、人民剧团直到专县剧团，特别是这一次的作品中，出现了不少这类“小天才家”，“小政治家”。这就使真实性大为减色。艺术没有真实性，是不会有生命的。
    也有不少作品，完全或多多少少地，不从政治思想政策思想的指导下，把客观发生的各种事件，加以批判分析，集中表现，而单纯的把许多表现现象，原封不动地搬到纸上去。什么事情也谈，什么事情也谈不透。不从各阶级的各类型人物，各类型干部与各类型群众，加以阶级分析，再集中表现，而是什么人物也有，什么人物也没有个性，作品本身又缺乏故事性。而这一切，恰恰又是在戏剧艺术中十分重要的。
    文艺作品，要想同时解决很多主题，是很吃力的。这就使不少作品枉费了功夫。包罗万象，长篇大论，就把回答现实生活中某些问题的良好意图，使之落空了。
    艺术作品，要求有生动活泼的感动力；生硬的政治说教，不容易产生良好的效果。不从马列主义指导下的现实主义的创作方法，集中典型来表现，就会使作品软弱无力。
    四、前进面与落后面的表现；丰饶的风趣和庸俗低级思想的处理
    很多作者，没有正确地解决上述的问题，每每在写黑暗落后的东西，倒是兴趣横生，有声有色；而对光明与前进的东西，则如嚼破絮，枯燥寡味。如反迷信的作品，几乎全部是谎诞离奇的传说。白日见鬼，兴妖作怪的玩艺儿，写得淋漓尽致，煞有介事，颇为突出，使人看了有阴风惨惨，鬼影憧憧之感。这类作品的题材，都从这两个方面来：一是历史传奇故事，如“河伯娶妇”，“关公制周仓”，“周仓整观音”等等；一是农村中的神婆活动，怎样下神捉鬼，招魂治病，误死人命，最后是巫神坦白等等，千篇一律，大同小异。一般都是以大部时间和篇幅来写这些，最后留根老鼠尾巴似地来揭破它，而这根尾巴，都是闹个笑话形式来结束。这类作品占全部作品的最多数。这也说明迷信是现实农村中急须解决的问题。同时也说明作者对这类谎谬怪诞的故事，颇有兴趣。可是如此写法，在今天农村群众科学知识还不高的情况下，它的正面作用，远不如副作用大。人民剧团演出“红鞋女妖精”后，把许多小孩和勤务员吓得不敢上茅房了。
    某些作品，庸俗的低级趣味思想是存在的。为了要逗观众发笑，无因无故加个不必要的，与戏毫不相干的噱头。如母女在敌人“清剿”的逃难中，尽情地开玩笑。战争如此严重紧张，那来这样的闲情逸致？而且农村的母女关系上也不自然。特别是关于两性问题，赤裸裸地在舞台上表现，这是十分低级的。写敌人对妇女的侮辱，不能正面来写，否则必然会使某些观众哄然大笑，绝不能增强群众同仇敌忾。戏剧艺术上，越是粗野的侮辱，越要严肃的处理。无产阶级的文艺，是要求有战斗的崇高健康的文化生活，绝不能延展到庸俗的腐朽的堕落意识的笑话上去，特别在戏剧上，必须注意艺术的严肃性。
    五、语言和形式
    不少作品，在语言上形式上写得很好，唱词上，学会和吸取了民歌中的描写法、比喻法、衬托法，而且采用为群众所喜闻乐见的诗歌形式，但也有采用很狭窄的地方土语（地方土语在当地的演唱上，完全必要，但对一部作品来说，则至少应有相当的全区共通语言，否则就限制了作品的推广），也有俚俗语的硬套。有的作品，写的是中国形式，但夹杂着半中半西的生硬的欧化言语，使得作品在情调上不协和，念给群众听，会感到不熟悉。通俗作品，应该使群众能听懂，通俗的诗歌，我以为必须是能上口的。
    有的作品（戏剧），存在着戏剧八股，公式主义，收场必定是个大合唱或大齐唱，而又必定是秧歌舞，而唱词必定是“毛主席象红灯”，“共产党是救星”等等。故事的发展，不一定最后是个大合唱，大秧歌的插花舞；毛主席和党是应该歌颂的，但应采取与群众切实相联的内容和语言形式来歌颂，缺少这一点，就不自然了。
    六、旧剧形式的历史剧创作
    作者一般对历史材料了解研究还不够，缺乏正确的历史观，也有歪曲了历史的（如果是用历史的唯物主义去改正过去为统治阶级所歪曲了的历史，是可以而且应该的）。在写作上，还仅仅限在形式上的套来套去。写农民起义的史料，和其他的帝王将相在舞台上出现，是一模一样的，只是换了个名字而已，不能写出历史的真相与因果。而且有很不合情理的现代语言：如“反对帝国主义”，“解放人民”，“反封建”等现代政治斗争口号出现，这是不妥当的。我们不能把历史死去的人物，硬拉到现在来活，同时也不能把现在推到数百年前的枯骨堆中去。我们写历史剧，是要从历史上吸取教训，而不是以现在的政治斗争来修改它，而且也是修改不了的。
    综上所述，可以看到：我们对党的路线政策不了解，理论水平还很差，现实主义的创作方法，还不熟悉或缺乏明确理解。因此，使我们有的作品，未能达到政治上、思想上崇高丰富的境地。也有很多是技术上和经验上的问题（如缺少舞台经验，创作剧作就有困难，但多写几回就可以克服的）。我以为提高政治理论水平是根本的，因为如果进行文艺创作，不了解不研究党的路线和政策，很难正确反映人民之所以胜利的根本原因。
    如作为群众性的，业余性的文艺创作来说，成绩是肯定的，并值得表扬。但要作为作品，是供给群众看或听的来说，就需要提出来，因为观众不管你群众性不群众性，业余性非业余性，他是从作品的演或唱上，直接感到完满或不完满的。
    以上提出的问题，不一定对，只是把感觉提出，作为参加创作的同志共同来研究这个问题的一块引玉之砖。
