　　Celebrating the Liberation of Tianjin Tanggu
  　Our Newspaper's First Batch of 慰问 (Comfort) Bags Sent to the Front Lines
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] To celebrate the great victory of liberating Tianjin and Tanggu, all personnel of our newspaper warmly慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude to) the frontline soldiers of the Northeast and North China Field Armies. On the beds of the General Affairs Section, a large pile of慰问 (comfort) bags were placed, red, white, floral,绒 (velvet), made of large towels, packaged in cellophane... Inside, they were filled with cigarettes, soap, diaries,慰问 (comfort) letters, etc. One package had written across it: One towel; A self-reflection mirror; A rope to tie up Fu Zuoyi... The typesetting worker Liu Qingchang wrote: The Liberation Army is truly strong, beating Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Fu all over the place, hiding and hiding into pits, the Liberation Army wants to dig pits, casually leading away sheep; Firmly determined to go south of the Yangtze River, to be a hero to the end of the revolution. The little devils in the mail room, four people together made two慰问 (comfort) bags, and when they were about to hand them over, they felt that the送 (gifts) were a little less, and wrote in the letter: "Dear soldiers: We wanted to buy more things to慰问 (express sympathy) you, but we have no money. You are killing the enemy in the freezing cold, we guarantee that we will work harder in the future, this wish, even if it is a gift to劳 (comfort) you!"
    On the 17th, several of the most exquisite ones were selected and exhibited in front of the dining hall. It was decided that the first batch of more than one hundred and fifty received would be handed over to the North China People's Government on the 20th for forwarding to the front lines.

　　庆祝天津塘沽解放
  　本报第一批慰问袋送前方
    【本报讯】庆祝解放天津与塘沽的伟大胜利，本报全体人员热烈慰问东北华北两大野战军前方将士。在总务科的床上，摆满了一大堆慰问袋，红的、白的、花的、绒的、大毛巾做的、玻璃纸包装的……里面填满了纸烟、肥皂、日记本、慰问信等，有一包上面横写着：毛巾一条；自我检讨镜子一面；捆傅作义绳子一根……。排字工人刘庆昌写着：解放大军真是强，打的蒋贼傅匪满地藏，藏来藏去入了坑，解放大军要挖坑，顺手随便牵了羊；坚决心志江南上，革命到底把英雄当。收发室的小鬼们，四个人合做了两个慰问袋，临交去的时候，觉得送的少了一点，在信上写道：“亲爱的战士们：我们想多买点东西慰问你们，可是没钱了。你们在冰天雪地里杀敌人，我们保证今后更加努力工作，这个志愿，也算件礼物带去慰劳你们吧！”
    十七日曾挑选了几个做得最精致的在饭厅前展览。决定于二十日把收到的第一批一百五十多个先交华北人民政府转送送前线。
