(Jinzhong News) Last summer, the Jinzhong Jinhua Textile Factory, which suffered severe damage from the Yan [Xishan] bandits, was taken over by the local democratic government. Workers were mobilized to repair the damaged machines and move them to a safe area to start operations. After the workers became their own masters, their enthusiasm for production soared, enabling × thousand spindles to resume operation. Moreover, the quality, output, and savings in labor and raw materials are unprecedented. For example, in the past, if the yarn or cloth broke, a large knot was tied, and the loose ends were not trimmed, resulting in a rough and unwearable fabric. But the liberated workers consciously trim the loose ends and carefully rejoin the broken threads, resulting in a smooth and dense fabric. “One hank” of yarn can save eight inches compared to before, and one cart has forty-eight “hanks,” which saves three hundred and eighty-four inches. One worker can spin more than thirty carts a day, saving a total of more than eleven thousand five hundred inches. If the savings of the entire factory are calculated, the number is astonishing. In the past, one shift of "doffing" took four minutes, but now, due to mutual cooperation, "doffing" takes only two minutes. Due to insufficient power, which greatly hindered development, the workers repaired the broken steam engine that had been discarded for many years, making it a 500-horsepower engine. Therefore, the factory is actively planning to expand the operation of × ten thousand spindles starting from January this year. The factory originally planned to recruit one hundred and seventy-five workers, but within two days of the recruitment advertisement being issued, more than four hundred workers (including more than two hundred and forty skilled workers) had applied. Further recruitment is planned for any time.

　　晋中晋华纺织厂工人
  　重建工厂扩大生产
  　修整残破机器增大纺锭数量
    【晋中讯】去年夏季，遭受阎匪严重破坏的晋中晋华纺织工厂，经当地民主政府接管后，发动工人把残破机器修整后，已转移到安全地带开工。工人们自己当家以后，生产情绪高涨，使×千个锭子得以复工。且在质量上、产量上、以及人力、原料的节省是前所未见的。例如，在过去，纺纱和织布断了头，接上个很大的圪＠，毛头也不剪，织出的布面很粗糙、不耐穿，而解放了的工人则自觉的把毛头剪掉、断了头的线也过细的接好，因此，织出来的布面又平整，又紧密；“一辫线”能比从前省下八寸，而一车有四十八“辫”，就能节约三百八十四寸，而一个工人一天能摇三十多车，共省一万一千五百多寸。如果把全厂的节省量计算起来，数字是惊人的；某班过去“落纱”一次需四分钟，现在则由于互相的协作进行“落纱”，每次只需二分钟；由于动力的不足，很妨碍发展，工人们则把历年来废弃的破蒸汽机加以修整，使之成为五百匹马力的动力。因之，该厂正积极计划：将于今年元月起扩大×万个锭子的开工。厂方原拟定招考一百七十五名工人，而在招生广告发出后两天，报名工人即达四百余人（其中熟练工人二百四十余人）。今后并拟随时招收。
