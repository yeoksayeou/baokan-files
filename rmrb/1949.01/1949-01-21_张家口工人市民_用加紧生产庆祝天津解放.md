　　Zhangjiakou Workers and Citizens
  　Celebrate the Liberation of Tianjin with Increased Production
    [Zhangyuan Telegraph] The good news of the liberation of Tianjin spread to Zhangjiakou, and all circles celebrated joyfully. On the evening of the 15th, as soon as the news of the liberation of Tianjin came from the radio, all the staff of the Chahar Daily boiled over and rushed to print a large number of extras. The next morning, this exciting news spread throughout the streets and alleys of Zhangjiakou. At eight o'clock in the morning, before the train had even departed, the passengers bought up all the several hundred copies of the extra from the newspaper vendors. After the train left, many people still anxiously reached out from the train windows to buy them. An illiterate person in the market bought a copy of the extra and looked everywhere for someone literate to read it to him; the propaganda team went around beating gongs and drums, broadcasting the news of the liberation of Tianjin all the way with a loudspeaker. Yang Huating, an old worker in the railway factory, told reporters: "In order to quickly take down Beiping, we are rushing to make crowbars and saddles for the People's Liberation Army. Three hundred pieces must be completed in five days. Tianjin has been liberated, and we will not rest even though it is Sunday today!" Gao Chuanxiang, a worker at the tobacco company, happily lifted the door curtain and said loudly: "Damn it, this time Fu Zuoyi is finished! Our machines have been repaired long ago. Once the materials arrive after the liberation of Tianjin, we can start work immediately!" The citizens on the street were happily talking everywhere: "This is good news. With the liberation of Tianjin, Beiping will be quick."

　　张家口工人市民
  　用加紧生产庆祝天津解放
    【张垣电】天津解放捷报传来张市，各界欢腾庆祝。十五号晚上，天津解放的消息刚一从电台传出，察哈尔日报全体职工马上就沸腾起来，连着赶印了大批的号外，第二天一清早，这个振奋人心的消息就传遍张市的各个大街小巷了。早晨八点钟，火车还没有开，乘客们一下来就把报贩的几百份号外买光了，车开以后，有许多人还着急的从车窗伸出手来买。市场上一个不识字的人买了一份号外，到处找识字的人给他读；宣传队到处敲着锣鼓，一路走一路用大话筒子广播着解放天津的消息，铁路工厂老工务员杨华亭告诉记者：“为了快点打下北平，我们正给解放军赶制翘棍和马鞍子，三百根五天就要完成。天津解放了，今天星期我们也不休息了！”烟草公司的工人高传祥高兴的一掀门帘就大声地说：“他妈的，这回傅作义可垮了！我们的机器早就修理好了，天津这一解放，来了材料，马上就可以开工啦！”街上的市民们，到处高兴的交谈着：“这可是个喜讯，天津一解放，北平就快了。”
