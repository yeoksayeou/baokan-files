Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Launches Winter Military Training Movement
　Actively Preparing to Move Out
[Dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 10th] For several months, the local armed forces of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region have been in high spirits, preparing to carry out the glorious task of "the army moving forward." As early as last September, after Jinan and Heze were successively liberated, the military region issued public instruction letters to the 2nd, 5th, and 6th military sub-regions, proposing three major tasks: establishing a nationwide victory concept, strengthening cadre study, and implementing the merit system, to effectively prevent and overcome "rest-and-rehabilitation" thinking. It was pointed out that only by liberating all of China and completely annihilating the Chiang bandits can there be peace. At the end of November, the Party Committee of the military region, after careful discussion, formulated a winter work policy, determining to launch a winter military training movement focused on politics in December, January, and February. The main purpose is to implement the strategic policy of "the army moving forward and strengthening discipline," to overcome localism, guerrilla habits, and the state of being unorganized and undisciplined, and to lay a solid foundation for the troops to move out in the future. By November 25th, at the second congress of model heroes of the military region, many people examined their own backward and conservative thinking. For example, combat hero Bai Guang, when examining his unwillingness to leave the region, said: "This is contrary to Chairman Mao's strategic policy, and it must be overcome." When making plans, all the more than 80 model heroes present, no matter how they wrote it, had one thing in common: "Guaranteeing to lead the troops forward." Sailor hero Yin Daolian's plan was even better, he said, "When the great march crosses the Yangtze River, I will ferry across the Yangtze River, and I guarantee that I have no regional concept." A profound criticism was made of thoughts that were in conflict with moving forward. Before a certain regiment of the 7th military sub-region set out for the Huaihai front, they let the soldiers investigate the atrocities of the Chiang bandits in their place of residence, and then concentrated on education. The directly subordinate units of the 2nd military sub-region asked family members to report on the family situation to the troops, encouraging the soldiers' enthusiasm to move forward. Wang Changyun, a soldier from Yuncheng, had his uncle tell everyone: "The village is engaging in mutual aid production, and life is very good." Finally, he specifically pointed out that the government takes good care of the families of soldiers. He said: "I have also worked in warlord troops for more than ten years in the past. At that time, who ever asked about my family? Now the government helps with everything at home. If I were young, I would have to work for a few more years. Now my family hopes you don't miss home and asks you to wipe out old Chiang, otherwise, there will still be no peace at home." At present, the local military corps are in high spirits and getting stronger as they fight. During the New Year, the front and rear organs, troops, and factories of the military region all sent letters of encouragement, and the entire military region is filled with the heroic spirit of "the army moving forward."

　　冀鲁豫开展冬季建军运动
  　积极准备打出去
    【冀鲁豫十日电】数月来冀鲁豫军区地方武装，士气旺盛，准备执行“军队向前进”的光荣任务。远在去年九月济南、荷泽相继解放后，军区先后向二、五、六等分区发出公开指示信，提出树立全国胜利观念，加强干部学习，贯彻立功运动等三件重大工作，以有效地防止和克服“歇兵”思想。指出只有解放全中国，全歼蒋匪才能安生。十一月底军区党委会经过慎重讨论，制订出冬季工作方针，确定在十二月、一月、二月等三个月内开展以政治为主的冬季建军运动，主要是贯彻“军队向前进增强纪律性”的战略方针，克服地方主义游击习气与无组织无纪律状态，为今后部队打出去打下巩固基础。至十一月二十五日，军区第二届功模大会中不少人检查了个人的落后保守思想，如战斗英雄白光，检查到自己总不愿离开本地区时，他说：“这和毛主席的战略方针相违背，一定要克服。”到订计划时，全体到会的八十余位功模，不管怎样写法，内容上都有一件“保证带领部队向前进”。水手英雄尹道连的计划更好，他说“大进军时过长江，我要到长江里摆渡，保证我没有地域观念”。对于前进相抵触的思想作了深刻批判。七分区某团在向淮海前线出动前，让战士于住地调查蒋匪暴行，然后集中进行教育。二分区直属队请家属给部队报告家庭情况，鼓励战士前进情绪。郓城战士王昌运的叔给大家说：“村里正搞互助生产，生活都很好。”最后还特别指出政府对军属照顾的很好。他说：“我过去也干过十几年军阀队伍，那时候家里有谁问过我？这时候家里有啥事政府都帮助，我要是青年的话，还得干几年。现在家里都希望你们不要想家，叫你们把老蒋打干净，要不家里还是不安生。”目前地方兵团均士气旺盛，越打越强。新年时，军区前后方机关部队工厂均致函鼓励，全军区部队充满着“军队向前进”的英勇气概。
