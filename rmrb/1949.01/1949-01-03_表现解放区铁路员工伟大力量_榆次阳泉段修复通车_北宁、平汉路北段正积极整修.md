　　Demonstrating the Great Strength of Railway Workers in Liberated Areas
  　Yuci-Yangquan Section Repaired and Opened to Traffic
    Northern Section of Beining and Pinghan Railways Undergoing Active Renovation
    [This newspaper dispatch] Overcoming numerous difficulties, the Yangquan-Dexian Railway, traversing the North China Liberated Area, continues to extend westward. The 97-kilometer Yangquan-Yuci section of the railway has been successfully repaired and was officially opened to traffic on December 20th. When construction began on this section in late August, there were many difficulties, such as damaged roadbeds and a shortage of steel rails. Transporting materials was not easy, and it was necessary to erect more than 130 large bridges. However, through the combined efforts of the railway workers and local veteran railway workers, as well as the enthusiastic support of the local masses, all kinds of difficulties were overcome. When repairing the Lujiazhuang Bridge, the workers carried 5,000 railway ties. The 12-meter-long steel rails used for the Xijiangong Bridge could not be transported through the mountain tunnels by animal-drawn carts, so the workers themselves pulled them all night. Finally, the tracks were successfully joined on December 5th, and the section was officially opened to traffic on the 20th. The entire Yuci-Dexian line, totaling 398 kilometers, is now fully open to traffic. This will play a greater role in supporting the front lines and promoting the exchange of goods between Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong provinces. (Shi Er)
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- Newly liberated railway lines, such as the northern sections of the Beining and Pinghan Railways, are being actively renovated by employees of each line. Among them, the Beidaihe-Shenyang section of the Beining Railway was officially opened to traffic on the 5th of this month. Railway employees in the Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao sections of the Beining Railway are continuing to work as usual under the leadership of work teams dispatched by the Northeast Railway Bureau. Employees at Qinhuangdao Station dismantled the city-encircling tracks built by the Chiang bandits to defend against the PLA's attack on the city and used these materials to rush the construction of the line to Changli. The Shihe Railway Bridge west of Shanhaiguan, which was destroyed by the Chiang bandits, was completed in just three to four days thanks to the workers' efforts. The 56 locomotives and more than 400 carriages preserved at Shanhaiguan, Qinhuangdao, and other stations are being repaired day and night by the employees of the locomotive depot. By the 5th of this month, seven locomotives had been put into operation. Railway employees on the Fengtai-Yangcun section of the Beining Railway between Tianjin and Beijing have also resumed work and are in high spirits after receiving wages issued by the Military Control Commission. The Baoding Station on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, which was severely damaged by the war criminal Liu Huanan, has been initially restored after half a month of efforts by all employees. The locomotive depot has refurbished long-idled locomotives, and the test runs have been very successful. Telephone lines at each station and section are now open. All original employees of the Baoding Railway, except for three committee members of the original Kuomintang-supported trade union, have been retained, including the director of the railway hospital, the director of the telecommunications section, and three deputy stationmasters of the transportation section.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd -- In the past three months, 88 employees of the Datong-Puzhou Railway in Taiyuan City have risked their lives to escape to the Liberated Areas to request work. Among them, 62 have been assigned to positions at various sections and stations by the Jinzhong Section Management Committee of the Datong-Puzhou Railway. According to the escaped employees, they were completely under the threat of terror and starvation in Taiyuan. It is said that since October, the base salaries of Taiyuan railway employees have been reduced by 70% across the board by the Yan bandits, and each person can only get 40 jin of coarse grains per month, making it impossible to maintain a basic standard of living. After the PLA tightened its encirclement of Taiyuan, all railway employees between the ages of 17 and 47 were drafted by the Yan bandits into the so-called "General War Service Group" to perform heavy labor. On November 23rd, 24 workers from the Taiyuan Datong-Puzhou Railway Administration were arrested and forced into the army. Wang Junjie and three other workers from the original Taigu Engineering Section, who recently escaped to the Liberated Areas, had attempted to escape six times without success. This time, they risked their lives by climbing out of the outer trenches at night and crossing barbed wire and minefields to break through the Yan bandit's blockade and reach the Liberated Areas.

　　表现解放区铁路员工伟大力量
  　榆次阳泉段修复通车
    北宁、平汉路北段正积极整修
    【本报讯】克服了重重困难，横贯华北解放区的阳（泉）德（县）铁路继续西延。阳（泉）榆（次）段的九十七公里铁路已修复告竣，并已于十二月二十日正式通车。该段于八月下旬动工时，困难频多，如路基破损，钢轨不足。运输器材不易，且须架设较大桥梁一百三十余座等。但经该路工友和当地老铁路工人结合，及当地群众的热烈支援，克服了各种困难。修芦家庄桥时，工友即曾扛运道木五千根。西建公桥使用的十二米长钢轨，牲口拉车转不过山洞，工友们便自己拉了一整夜，终于十二月五日胜利接轨，二十日正式通车。现榆（次）德（县）全线已完全通车，共长达三百九十八公里。对支援前线和晋、翼、鲁三省物资交流，将起更大作用。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（师二）
    【新华社陕北三十日电】新近解放的北宁、平汉北段等铁路线，正由各线员工积极整修中。其中，北宁铁路的北戴河至沈阳段，已于本月五日正式通车。北宁铁路山海关、秦皇岛段的铁路员工，在东北铁路局所派的工作队领导下，都照常进行工作。秦皇岛车站员工将蒋匪为防御解放军进攻该市而修筑的环市铁轨拆除，利用这些器材赶修通往昌黎的线路。山海关以西被蒋匪炸毁的石河铁桥，经员工赶修，三四天即告竣工。山海关秦皇岛等车站保存下来的五十六台机车及四百余节车箱，由机务段员工昼夜修理，到本月五日止，已有七辆机车开动起来。北宁铁路平津段间的丰台至杨村段的铁路员工亦已复工，并由军管会发了薪金，情绪很高。曾遭战犯刘化南严重破坏的平汉北段保定车站，经全体职工半月努力，现已初步恢复，复工员工已有五百六十余人。该站机务段已将长久停驶的机车修整一新，试车效果甚好。各站段电话现已畅通。保定铁路员工除原国民党御用工会委员三人外，原有职工，全部留用。其中包括铁路医院院长、电务股主任、运输段三个副站长在内。
    【新华社东北二十三日电】太原城内的同蒲铁路员工，最近三个月中已有八十八人，冒着生命危险逃来解放区要求工作。其中六十二人已由同蒲路晋中段管委会分配到各段站任职。据逃出员工说，他们在太原完全处于恐怖与饥饿的威胁之下。据说，自十月以来，太原铁路员工的底薪被阎匪普遍减少七成，每人每月仅能得杂粮四十斤，生活根本无法维持。解放军紧缩对于太原的包围圈后，凡年在十七岁以上四十七岁以下的铁路员工，均被阎匪编入所谓“总体参战用工组”，担负苛重劳役。十一月二十三日，太原同蒲铁路管理局工役二十四人，竟被抓去当兵。最近逃来解放区的原太谷工务段工人王俊杰等四人，曾六次出逃未成。这次是冒险于晚间爬出外壕，越过铁丝网、地雷群，才突破阎匪封锁到达解放区。
