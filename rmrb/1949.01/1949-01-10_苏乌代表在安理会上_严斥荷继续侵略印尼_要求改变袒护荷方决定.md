The Dutch imperialists' shameless actions are protected and condoned by the US-controlled Security Council. On December 27th of last month, when the Security Council reconvened to discuss the Indonesian issue, Soviet representative Malik and Ukrainian representative Tarasenko sternly condemned the Dutch's continued aggression and demanded that the Security Council change its so-called "mutual" ceasefire resolution passed on the 24th, which favored the Netherlands. They demanded that the Dutch aggressors cease fire and withdraw their troops within 24 hours. The just proposals of the Soviet and Ukrainian representatives were rejected again due to the open opposition of the US-British bloc, thus further encouraging the Netherlands to continue to complete its aggression plan. After the Security Council adjourned on the 29th, the Dutch troops, in addition to completing their plan to occupy all the cities of Java, continued to occupy most of the important cities, seaports, and mining areas of Sumatra, including the important oil field Jambi, the important coal-producing area Sawahlunto, and the important central Sumatran city of Pekanbaru (200 kilometers east-northeast).

　　苏乌代表在安理会上
  　严斥荷继续侵略印尼
  　要求改变袒护荷方决定
    荷兰帝国主义的这种无耻行动，是受到美国操纵下之安理会的保护和纵容的。上月二十七日，当安理会复会讨论印尼问题时，苏联代表马立克及乌克兰代表塔拉森柯曾严斥荷兰继续侵略的行动，要求安理会改变其于二十四日通过的偏袒荷兰的所谓“双方”停战的决议，要求强迫荷侵略者于二十四小时内停战并撤退其军队。苏联和乌克兰代表的正义提案，在美英集团的公然反对下，又被否决，因而再次鼓励荷兰继续完成其侵略计划。在二十九日安理会结束以后，荷军除了完成其占领爪哇一切城市的计划外，已继续占领了苏门答腊岛的绝大部分重要城市、海港和矿区，包括重要油田占碑、重要产煤区萨维龙托及苏岛中部的重要城市巴坎达洛（把东东北二百公里）。
