　　"Yangquan Furnace Industry" Problem
    Comrade Jianzhi: Regarding your inquiry about the Yangquan iron furnace industry, the reply is as follows:
    (1) There are four types of iron furnaces in Yangquan City: boiler (i.e., earthen furnace), stewing furnace, stir-frying furnace, and wrought iron furnace. A "stewing furnace" smelts ore into pig iron. A "stir-frying furnace" refines pig iron into wrought iron (i.e., the ordinary iron used for making farm tools). A "wrought iron furnace" is the blacksmith's furnace generally used for making farm tools and utensils. A "boiler" (earthen furnace) uses pig iron produced by the stewing furnace as raw material, melts it into molten iron, and pours it into a pot mold to cast pig iron pots. Boilers include smoke pots, Sichuan pots, baba pots, teapots, and bucket pots. The casting method is the same. Smoke pots and Sichuan pots are both made of pig iron and used for cooking. Another type is the sand-casting wide pot furnace. This wide pot furnace differs from the smoke pot furnace in the tools and raw materials used to melt the iron. The wide pot furnace uses an iron ladle to put charcoal and pig iron in it, heats it up to melt it into molten iron, and then pours it into a fixed mold. Its products are thinner and lighter than smoke pots. The boiler uses a furnace trench to melt the iron. A square enclosure is built with mud, inside which are placed earthen pots made of clay, filled with pig iron refined from a stewing furnace. It is heated to melt it into molten iron, which is poured into a pot mold to make a pot. The raw materials used are coarse, and the products are thicker and heavier than wide pots.
    (2) "Wind-fire furnace" uses the rotation of a belt to make a fan rotate rapidly and generate wind, which is blown into the furnace (i.e., the ladle generally used for sand casting, containing coke and pig iron) to aid combustion and generate high heat to melt it into molten iron. There are two types of power: one is human-powered, and the other is electric-powered. Converting a smoke pot furnace to a wind-fire furnace means adopting the above-mentioned method of melting iron, pouring the molten iron into a smoke pot mold. In this way, the iron can be melted in two hours. However, a smoke pot furnace takes two days to melt iron using a furnace. According to current experimental results, converting an earthen furnace to a wind-fire furnace increases production by more than one time.
    (3) Baba pot furnaces and teapot furnaces are both cast from stewed iron (i.e., pig iron produced by stewing furnaces) after being melted in an earthen furnace. Because baba pots do not sell well, and teapots made of pig iron are bulky and consume a lot of fuel, these two products are not popular with the masses. Therefore, they are being converted into bucket pot furnaces, because bucket pots sell quickly, and the molds for bucket pots are similar to those for baba pots and teapots, making the transformation easy. Bucket pots are shaped like buckets, with the pot mouth slightly larger than the bottom. The bottom is pointed and round, with three legs on the bottom for stable placement.
    (4) @Shi refers to ore.
    (5) A "ba huo" (literally, "handle of fire" meaning a work team) has one person in charge of tongs and one to four hammerers. The tools include bellows, furnace plate, pliers, and hammers. Each furnace has anywhere from one to six "ba huo".
    (6) "Chou shi zeng tu" (literally, "withdraw master increase apprentice"): Currently, because the demand for iron products exceeds the supply, most furnace workers in the past were skilled workers operating in partnerships, not taking on apprentices. To increase production, masters are withdrawn, and apprentices are added. This method is used to increase the number of work teams. It is abbreviated as "chou shi zeng tu."
    (7) "Yangquan iron furnaces number four hundred and ninety-two," including both pig iron and wrought iron furnaces (excluding stewing furnaces and stir-frying furnaces). Of these, purely privately owned (i.e., labor-capital relations) account for three, joint ventures account for thirty-one (labor-capital relations), and worker cooperatives account for four hundred and fifty-eight. The so-called Yangquan iron furnaces are all privately run. There are no publicly owned ones. The production relations of joint-stock furnaces and private furnaces are the same; they all hire labor, with fixed wages, and profits and losses have nothing to do with the workers.
    (8) "Worker cooperative furnace": All workers own shares, and non-workers are not allowed to hold shares. The funds are raised by the workers (a few pecks of millet count as one share). In addition to earning differential wages based on skill level, at the end of each period, profits are distributed according to shares, and losses are shared by everyone. Therefore, in "worker cooperative furnaces," workers have higher production enthusiasm than in other furnaces, because profits and losses are related to the workers. Increased production means higher dividends, and losses are borne by the workers themselves. Their work attitude, including caring for tools and saving raw materials, is better than that of furnaces with labor-capital relations. Therefore, their output and quality are higher than those of joint-stock and private furnaces with labor-capital relations.

### “阳泉炉业”问题

专栏：询问与答复

　　“阳泉炉业”问题
    建之同志：所询阳泉铁炉业问题，答复如下：
    （一）阳泉市铁炉分锅炉（即土炉）、焖炉、炒炉、熟铁炉四种。“焖炉”是把矿石炼成生铁。“炒炉”是把生铁再炼成熟铁（即普通用作打农具的铁）。“熟铁炉”即一般打农具、用具的铁匠炉。“锅炉”（土炉）是用焖炉出品的生铁当原料，再熔化成铁水，倾注在锅模里，即铸成生铁锅，锅炉包括烟锅、川锅、把把锅、茶壶、桶锅。其铸法相同。烟锅、川锅均系生铁铸成做饭用的锅。另有一种即翻沙的广锅炉，此种广锅炉，与烟锅炉在熔化铁水用的工具上和原料上都不同。广锅炉是用铁制成炉杓放入炭及生铁加高热化成铁水，再倒入定型模子里，其出品较烟锅薄而轻，锅炉是利用炉壕熔化铁水，用泥土筑成方形的围墙内，装有用甘土捏成的甘土锅，内装上用焖炉炼出来的生铁，加高热熔化成铁水，倒在锅模子里，即成锅。所用原料粗糙，其出品较广锅厚而重。
    （二）“风火炉”即利用轮带的转动，使风扇急烈转动而生风，吹入炉内（即一般翻沙用的炉杓，内装焦炭生铁，）以助燃烧，使发高热而化成铁水。动力有两种：一种用人摇动，一种用电力催动。烟锅炉改风火炉，即采上述熔铁方法熔化出铁水倒入烟锅模内，如此两小时即可使铁水熔化。而烟锅炉用炉烧化铁水，需两天时间才能化出，改土炉为风火炉，现在实验结果，其生产量增加一倍以上。
    （三）把把锅炉茶壶炉均系用焖铁（即焖炉出品的生铁），经过土炉熔化而铸成的，因把把锅销路不畅，茶壶因生铁铸成又笨又费燃料，此两种出品均不为群众欢迎，故将其改为桶锅炉，因桶锅销路快，又因桶锅模与把把锅、茶壶模的作法相似，改造容易，至桶锅状如桶形，锅口稍大于锅底，其底尖圆，为了置放稳便，底上有三足。
    （四）＠石即矿石。
    （五）把火，每把火有一个掌钳的，一个至四个打锤的，其工具包括：风箱、炉盘、钳锤等，每座炉由一把火至六把火不等。
    （六）“抽师增徒”：现因铁货供不应求，过去炉上工匠多系技术工人合伙经营，不带徒弟。为了增加产量，抽出师傅，增加徒弟，用此办法，来增加火把数。简称“抽师增徒”。
    （七）“阳泉铁炉四百九十二座”，生熟铁炉均在内（不包括焖炉炒炉），内纯粹私营（即劳资关系的）占三座，合股经营的三十一座（劳资关系），工人合作经营的四百五十八座。所谓阳泉铁炉，均系民办炉，没有公营的。合股炉、私营炉的生产关系，都是一样的，全系雇人劳动，有固定工资、赔挣与工人无关。
    （八）“工人合作炉”：凡工人均有股，不吸收非工人股，其资金由工人凑集（几斗小米算一股）。工人除按技术高低挣等差工资外，每期结帐盈余，再按股分红，亏了大家负责。因此，“工人合作炉”工人生产情绪较其他炉高，因赔挣与工人有关，多生产出来多分红，亏了是给工人自身的。其劳动态度，包括爱护工具、节省原料等，均比劳资关系的炉为好，故其产量质量也较劳资关系的合股炉、私营炉都高。
