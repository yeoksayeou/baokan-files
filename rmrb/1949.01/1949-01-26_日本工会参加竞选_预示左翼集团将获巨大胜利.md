Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th.  Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo: Just as American workers called for the defeat of all Congressmen who voted in favor of the Taft-Hartley Act during the election, Japanese trade unions are now also participating in the election, calling for the defeat of all Diet members who voted for the National Public Service Law (which abolished the right to strike and collective bargaining for three million government and public enterprise employees). Unions belonging to the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Organizations have posted many announcements showing the voting records of Diet members in the parliament, so that the people can decide for themselves whom to elect. However, in some cities, the police even consider these announcements as "violating the election law." The police told the unions that they could only post these announcements inside their factories. Unionists admit that conservatives will continue to hold power after the January elections. However, they predict that the left-wing groups centered on the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party, which defend labor, will achieve a huge victory. Twelve leaders of the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Organizations are participating in the election, nine of whom are listed on the Communist Party's candidate list, two are running as Socialists, and one is running as a Labor-Farmer Party candidate. Thirteen leaders of the conservative Japanese Federation of Labor are campaigning as Socialist candidates.

　　日本工会参加竞选
  　预示左翼集团将获巨大胜利
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】电通社东京讯：正如美国工人在竞选时号召打败所有投票赞成塔虎脱——哈特莱法的国会议员一样，现在，日本工会也正在竞选，并号召打败投票赞成全国公务员法（即取消了三百万政府与公营事业员工的罢工与集体议价的权利）的所有议员。属于日本产业劳动组合联合会的各工会，已张贴许多表示议员在议会中投票记录的告白，以便让人民自己决定选谁。然而，在若干城市中，警察甚至将这种告白也认为是“破坏选举法”。警察告诉工会说，他们只能把这些告白贴在他们的工厂内。工会人士承认，在一月的大选后，保守分子将继续掌握政权。但是，他们预示以共产党与工农党为中心的维护劳工的左翼集团，将获得巨大胜利。日本产业劳动组合联合会有十二名负责人参加竞选，其中九名列在共产党候选人的名单上，两名以社会党人资格竞选，一名以工农党人资格竞选。保守的日本劳动总同盟的十三位首领，正作为社会党候选人而从事竞选。
