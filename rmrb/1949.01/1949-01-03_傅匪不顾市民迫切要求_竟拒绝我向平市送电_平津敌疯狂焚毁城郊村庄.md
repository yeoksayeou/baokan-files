Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Front, 27th. Electric lights in the vast southwest suburbs outside the liberated Beiping city have been completely repaired. The Shijingshan Jibei Electric Power Company power plant, which supplies all electricity to Beiping city and its suburbs, has been generating electricity since 17:05 on the 22nd. Power workers, braving enemy fire, have also repaired the 110,000-volt high-voltage power line from Shijingshan to Nanyuan. The 33,000-volt high-voltage trunk lines from Nanyuan via Fengtai, Changxindian, Liangxiang to Liulihe, and from Nanyuan to Huangcun, were also completely repaired and energized before the 25th. In order to protect the interests of all people in Beiping, the power plant started supplying electricity to Beiping city as usual from 4 pm today, but it was rejected by the traitor Fu.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin-Beiping Front, 28th. The traitor Fu Zuoyi, disregarding the urgent demands of the people of Beiping, refused the People's Liberation Army to supply electricity to the city. The People's Liberation Army started supplying electricity to the people in the city from the Shijingshan Power Plant at 4 pm on the 27th of this month. It was originally planned to supply 40,000 kilowatts of electricity according to the usual nighttime electricity demand of the people in Ping City, but after the power supply started, the traitor Fu refused to receive it, and the vast majority of the people in Beiping city are still in a dark world.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin-Beiping Front, 28th. The Chiang-Fu bandit troops, trapped in the isolated cities of Beiping and Tianjin, are frantically setting fire to civilian houses and villages in the suburbs of the two cities in a desperate struggle. The Fu bandits in Beiping recently set fires in the outer city's western and southern suburbs, and most of the houses of the local residents were destroyed. Residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, cried bitterly and fled to the People's Liberation Army garrison. On the 20th of this month, more than a thousand refugees fled to Fengtai from the Guang'anmen and Zuo'anmen areas alone. The People's Liberation Army has provided relief and resettlement. The bandit troops in Tianjin also set fire to villages in the suburbs of the city. All the villagers' property was completely reduced to ashes, and they fled empty-handed. Some of the refugees who fled to Tianjin were thinly clothed, homeless, and wandered the snowy streets, looking for food and shelter from the cold, and the situation was extremely miserable.

　　傅匪不顾市民迫切要求
  　竟拒绝我向平市送电
    平津敌疯狂焚毁城郊村庄
    【新华社天津前线二十七日电】在解放了的北平城外西南郊广大地区内电灯已完全修复。供应北平市内及四郊全部电力的石景山冀北电力公司发电厂，已于二十二日十七时零五分起发电。电力工人又冒着敌人的炮火，修复了石景山至南苑间十万七千高压电的大线，自南苑经丰台、长辛店、良乡至琉璃河，及南苑至黄村间的三万三千高压电干线，也已于二十五日前全部修竣通电。为了保障北平市各界人民的利益，该发电厂已于本日下午四时起，向北平城内照常供电，但竟为傅匪所拒绝。
    【新华社平津前线二十八日电】傅匪作义不顾北平人民之迫切要求，竟拒绝人民解放军向城内送电。人民解放军于本月二十七日下午四时，由石景山发电所向城内人民送电，本准备按照平市人民平时夜间之需电量送电四万基罗瓦特，但放送电开始后，傅匪竟拒绝接收，北平城内广大人民仍陷黑暗世界中。
    【新华社平津前线二十八日电】困守平津孤城之蒋傅匪军，为进行垂死挣扎，正在疯狂地放火烧毁两城城郊的民房和村庄。北平傅匪近在外城西城厢与南城厢地区放火，当地住民房屋大部被毁。居民扶老携幼，痛哭失声，纷纷向解放军驻地逃亡。本月二十日，仅在广安门与左安门一带就有千余难民逃到丰台。解放军已予以救济安置。天津的匪军也放火烧毁城效村庄。村中居民的全部家产完全化为灰尽，空着双手逃亡，其中一部分逃到天津去的难民，衣着单薄，无家可归，徘徊在风雪的街道上，寻打食物和躲避严寒的处所，情况极为凄惨。
