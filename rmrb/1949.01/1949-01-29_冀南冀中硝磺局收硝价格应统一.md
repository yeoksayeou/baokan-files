Criticism and Suggestions

　　To the Editor:
    Currently, the purchasing price of saltpeter by the Southern Hebei Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau and the Central Hebei Saltpeter Bureau is inconsistent. In Central Hebei, one jin of saltpeter (first-class saltpeter) is purchased at the equivalent of five jin of millet, while in Southern Hebei, it is five jin of wheat. This leads saltpeter producers in Central Hebei to travel long distances to Southern Hebei to sell their saltpeter, wasting manpower and causing disputes. Therefore, I suggest that the North China Nitrate and Sulfur General Bureau should standardize the purchasing price so that saltpeter workers can enjoy the same treatment.

### 冀南冀中硝磺局收硝价格应统一

　　冀南冀中硝磺局收硝价格应统一编辑同志：
    现在冀南硝磺局和冀中火硝局收购火硝价格不一致。冀中收硝每一斤火硝（头等硝）以五斤小米折款收购，冀南却是五斤小麦。这样使冀中的硝民常远道去冀南卖硝，浪费了许多人力，且引起纠纷。因之我建议华北硝磺总局应统一收购价额，使硝工们享有同样的待遇。
