To the Party Committees, Trade Unions, and Worker Comrades of all cities:

　　Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee enthusiastically responded to this newspaper's call to strengthen reporting on the lives of industrial workers, industry and commerce, and urban work. It convened a meeting of special correspondents (see this newspaper, January 20th for details), placing communication work on the agenda of leadership work. The Propaganda Department regularly summarizes communication work, establishes a reward and punishment system, and decided to form a central group with responsible cadres from the Party, government, and trade union as the core, to help the heads of each communication group draft reporting points, and establish a system for receiving, sending, modifying, and returning manuscripts. This spirit of loving the Party newspaper and implementing the principle of the whole Party running the newspaper is very good. It is hoped that the Propaganda Department of the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee will also devote sufficient effort to organize worker writing and cultivate worker correspondents in large numbers, making them the basic force of Party newspaper correspondents. Secondly, the Shijiazhuang Electric Light Company, Northern Printing Factory, Jingxing Coal Mine General Trade Union, Handan Railway Administration, Yangquan Workers' Newspaper, Jizhong Anping Zhenhua Wire Drawing Factory, Military Region Supply Department No. 1 Clothing Bureau, Changzhi Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, etc., have all begun to organize communication groups to strengthen communication and reporting on employee movements, worker life, and industrial production, which is very good. It is hoped that Party committees, trade unions, and worker comrades everywhere will work together, referring to the practices of Yangquan and other places, to give full play to the high creativity and wisdom of the working class, and jointly do a good job in reporting on the work of industrial workers and urban construction.

　　培养工人通讯员作好城市建设的报导各城市党委、职工会及工人同志：
    最近阳泉市委宣传部热烈响应本报加强报导产业工人生活、工商业及城市工作的号召，召开了特约通讯员会议（详见一月二十日本报），将通讯工作列为领导工作议事日程之一。宣传部定期总结通讯工作，建立奖惩制，并决定以党、政、工负责干部为中心，成立中心小组，帮助各通讯组长拟出报导要点，定出收发、修改及退稿制度。这种热爱党报和贯彻全党办报的精神是很好的，希望阳泉市委宣传部同时拿出足够力量，组织工人写作，大批培养工人通讯员，使他们成为党报通讯员的基本队伍。其次石家庄电灯公司、北方印刷厂、井陉煤矿总工会、邯郸铁路管理局、阳泉职工报、冀中安平振华拔丝工厂、军区供给部第一被服局、长治市委宣传部等都已开始组织通讯小组，加强职工运动、工人生活及工业生产的通讯报导，这是很好的。希望各地党委、职工会、及工人同志大家一齐动手，参考阳泉等地作法，发挥工人阶级的高度创造性和智慧，共同努力作好产业工人和城市建设工作的报导工作。
