　　Xiajin Female Blacksmith Wang Guorong
　　Lives a Good Life by Blacksmithing
　　[Jinan News] Xu Jikui, a blacksmith in Weishang Street, Xiajin County, has a family of five. They lived by blacksmithing. In famine years, business was bad, and they couldn't earn enough to eat. He reluctantly dismissed the partner who swung the sledgehammer with him, and he could no longer do the blacksmith work, so life became more and more difficult. The children cried, and the adults worried, but they could see no way out. At this time, Jikui's wife, Wang Guorong, suggested to her husband that she would swing the sledgehammer to help with the blacksmithing. This was a very strenuous job. Jikui was very happy to hear this. At first, her hands and feet were a little uncoordinated, and her strength was short, but she resolutely continued. Now she has developed into a quite skilled female blacksmith. Every day, passers-by on the street cast surprised and envious glances at this female blacksmith. White-hot sparks spew out from under her sledgehammer, and steel is made into various tools under her hammer. Their labor reversed their difficult life, and they soon bought ten mu of land, using the space for blacksmithing to work in the fields, and life became more energetic. Last winter, they added another six mu of land, and this spring, they bought an ox with Wang Jincheng. Some time ago, the superiors called for winter plowing, and they quickly completed the task. This year, the land yielded a total of eight hundred jin of sorghum, five hundred jin of corn, five hundred jin of millet, and two hundred jin of beans, totaling more than two thousand jin of grain, and they also picked more than five hundred jin of cotton. They plan to buy some fertilizer for the land, and the money earned from blacksmithing is enough for daily expenses. In addition to blacksmithing, the female blacksmith Wang Guorong can also arrange daily chores in an orderly manner.

　　夏津女铁匠王国荣
  　凭打铁过好日子
    【冀南讯】夏津县城里卫生街，铁匠徐吉魁，全家五口人，仗凭打铁过活，灾荒年生意不好，挣不上饭吃，挨饥受冻将给他抱大锤打铁的伙友辞退了，铁匠活也就没法再干，生活便越来越困难。孩子哭，大人愁，眼看一点办法都没有；这时吉魁妻王国荣便向她丈夫提议，由她来抱大锤帮着打铁，这是件很费力气的活。吉魁听到后很高兴，一开始打的时候，手脚有些不随，力气也短，但她坚决干了下去。现在她已经锻炼成一个相当有技术的女铁匠。每天从街上过往的行人，都对这位女铁匠射出惊异与羡慕的眼光。白热的火花从她的大铁锤下喷出，钢铁在她的大锤下制成了各式各样的工具。他们的劳动扭转了艰苦的生活，不久买下十亩地，抽打铁的空间作地里活，日子过得更带劲。去年冬天又添了六亩地，今年春天又与王金城伙买了一头牛。前些时上级号召冬耕，他们就很快的完成了任务。今年地里共收了八百斤高粱，五百斤玉茭，五百斤谷子，二百斤豆子，共计两千多斤粮食，还拾了五百多斤棉花。他们准备买些肥料上地，打铁挣的钱足够日用花消。女铁匠王国荣除了打铁外，还能把日常琐事安排得井井有条。
