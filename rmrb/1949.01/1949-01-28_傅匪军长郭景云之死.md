Xinhua News Agency, North China, 21st—The death of Guo Jingyun, commander of the so-called "ace" 35th Army of Fu Zuoyi, was preceded by him spending his days hiding in a cave, tossing copper coins for divination, and cursing Fu Zuoyi for deceiving him. This is another joke told by captured Fu army officers and soldiers. It is said that Guo Jingyun often boasted to people that his army was "always there to assist and could break any siege." However, after the People's Liberation Army tightly surrounded him in Xinbao'an, he was so frightened that he became mentally disturbed and dared not even think about combat issues, leaving everything to Feng Zi, the commander of the 101st Division. He himself hid in a cave in the city and tossed copper coins for "divination." One toss was unfavorable, and another was also unfavorable. The people around him had long lost confidence in the war, but seeing the "commander" getting angry, they flattered him, saying, "This is a good omen! This is a good omen!" Guo Jingyun listened and looked as if he had really been saved, and his worried face relaxed. But when he heard the sound of the People's Liberation Army's artillery, he became desperate and pessimistic again. When his subordinates reported emergency situations to him, he just hummed and hawed, not knowing what to do. On November 20th of last year, the People's Liberation Army's surrender notice was delivered to him. He foolishly refused to surrender and had no way to stop the People's Liberation Army, only getting so anxious that he beat his own head with his fists. He asked the bandit Fu for help every day, and the bandit Fu asked him to "wait for reinforcements," but no reinforcements ever came; he was told to "wait for an opportunity," but there was no opportunity to seize. On the 21st, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack to clear the periphery, and the bandit Fu telegraphed Guo, saying, "Tomorrow, a large number of air force planes will be sent to help in the battle and deliver 150 tons of supplies and ammunition." Guo Jingyun did not sleep all night, his eyes fixed on his watch. Time passed, one o'clock, two o'clock... By more than eight o'clock the next morning, the People's Liberation Army had already entered the city, but there was still no sign of the planes. The bandit Guo raged, shouting, "Fu Zuoyi deceived me!" "Li Shangjiu harmed me!" (Li Shangjiu was the regiment commander of the bandit troops defending the southeast of Xinbao'an, and that area was the first to be broken through by the People's Liberation Army.) At 3:00 p.m., the People's Liberation Army had approached the vicinity of the bandit Guo's headquarters. Guo Jingyun and his headquarters personnel fled north one after another, but the People's Liberation Army's fierce artillery fire blocked their escape route. Seeing that the situation was not good, his headquarters personnel abandoned the bandit Guo and fled separately. The bandit Guo was killed by artillery fire in his shelter.

　　傅匪军长郭景云之死
    【新华社华北二十一日电】傅作义的所谓“王牌”——三十五军的军长郭景云，在被击毙以前，成天躲在地洞里丢铜钱算卦，并大骂傅作义骗了他，这是被俘的傅军官兵说出来的又一个笑话。据称：郭景云往常常向人吹嘘他的军队是“援无不及，围无不解”。可是，当解放军把他紧紧包围在新保安后，就吓得精神失常，连作战问题都不敢多想，一切事情交给一零一师师长冯梓处置。他自己躲在城内地洞里丢铜钱“算卦”。丢一个不顺，丢一个又不顺。围在旁边的人，早已对战争丧失信心，但眼看到“军长”急得要发火的样子，便逢迎他说：“这一卦好，这一卦好！”郭景云听了，就象真的得救了似的，愁苦的面容就轻松了下来。可是听到解放军的大炮一响，他就又绝望悲观了。他部下给他报告紧急情况，他却哼呀哼的不知如何是好。去年十一月二十日，解放军的劝降通知送到他手里，他既愚蠢地拒不投降，又毫无阻挡解放军的办法，只是急得把拳头敲打自己的脑袋。他天天向傅匪求救，傅匪要他“待援”，但总不见援兵来到；要他“待机”，却又无机可乘。二十一日解放军发动扫清外围的攻击，傅匪电郭说：“明日要派大量空军前来助战，并送一五零吨给养、弹药。”郭景云那晚通霄未睡，两眼死钉手表；时间一点，两点……过去了，到次晨八点多钟，解放军已攻入城内，仍不见飞机的影子。郭匪气得乱叫：“傅作义骗了我！”“李上九害了我！”（李上九是匪部防守新保安东南的团长，该地被解放军首先突破）下午三时，解放军已逼近郭匪军部附近，郭景云及其军部人员纷纷向北逃跑，但解放军的猛烈炮火挡了他们的逃路。其军部人员一看大势不好，丢下郭匪各自逃散。郭匪就被炮火击毙于他的掩蔽部里。
