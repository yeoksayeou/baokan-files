[Taoyue Electric] The Guanzhuang Branch of the Second District of Tunliu was established in 1946 and has twelve members, most of whom are middle peasants, and the rest are small merchants. The four branch committee members are all from small merchant backgrounds, and they are cunning, hypocritical, and selfish in the party, with serious acts of infringing on the interests of the people. The initial party rectification was in the form of intensive training, which identified acts of infringing on the interests of the people and discovered four activists and four relatively good elements. After the work team arrived in the village, the branch secretary Zhang Zhisheng and Ding Wenbin pretended to be active in reflecting the situation in the village. Liu Hengfu said, "I used to have ideological baggage, but now I have unloaded it, and I must work hard." Because the work team did not go deep into the branch to understand the real situation and analyze and study it; nor did it go deep into the masses to listen to their reflections, they were deceived by these lies and thought that these people were "capable" and that they would have to rely on them to complete the end of land reform. Although activists Jia Shouyi and Song Kejian were democratically elected as branch committee members within the branch during the party rectification, the branch secretary Zhang Zhisheng suggested, "They can only run errands, let them be group leaders first!" He appointed Cui Zhixin, who had a good relationship with him, as a branch committee member, and the work team also agreed with this. This caused dissatisfaction among the party members in the branch. A few days later, the four branch committee members resisted the work of ending land reform. At meetings, some deliberately frowned and remained silent. The branch secretary Zhang Zhisheng did not attend the meeting and sent someone to call him twice, but he did not come. The work team had to go to call him in person. The four branch committee members all said, "I have baggage on my back." Liu Fuheng owed debts and refused to pay, and even said that he should not be criticized. Ding Xinbin and Cui Zhixin said, "The work team should not have brought up the matter of them preventing the masses from speaking at the meeting." The comrades of the work team did not seriously criticize them; instead, they were afraid that these branch committee members would be in low spirits, so they admitted their "mistakes" and "unloaded the baggage" for them one by one. As a result, the four branch committee members believed that the work team could not do without them, so they took turns resisting. Branch secretary Zhang Zhisheng said, "Our village is full of industrial and commercial problems, and the work team cannot lead it"; Ding Wenbin even ridiculed the work team, saying, "Corn stalks cannot be used as guns." Comrade Jia Longyuan of the work team asked them, "Where did the six burdens and victory fruits of the Farmers' Association go?" Branch committee member Cui Zhixin and others not only did not examine their own mistakes and return the illegally occupied fruits, but also cursed, "There is no such thing, it's simply farting!" Making it impossible to carry out criticism and self-criticism within the party at all; as soon as a party member raised an opinion, it would be immediately suppressed. For example, party member Jia Dingyi suggested, "The masses have reported that Cui Zhixin raped a woman, and we should review it." Branch secretary Zhang Zhisheng immediately threatened, "Do you know? Do you dare to take responsibility?" Activists Zhu Kejian and Xu Qinghuai suggested, "Liu Fuheng has been turned over too high, and the accounts of the Farmers' Association are unclear. The masses suspect that there is corruption and should be cleared up." Liu Fuheng said, "Go! Search my house immediately." Cui Zhixin and Zhang Zhisheng also said, "Being a cadre has come to this end, let them do it!" Everyone suggested, "Cui Zhixin should not have forced the middle peasant Luo Genqun to buy his house, and the Yongxing Coal Mine no longer has his shares, but he still withdrew 550,000 yuan in dividends, which is not right." Cui Zhixin immediately took a rope to threaten everyone to commit suicide, and the work team immediately said good things to Cui Zhixin: "Comrade, don't be afraid! The opinions of the masses are not necessarily correct, and the leadership will support you." In this way, accommodating party members with mistakes and relying on them to lead the work of ending land reform, of course, made the work impossible to carry out. They were active in studying other people's problems, but when it came to their own problems, it didn't work. For example, at a mass meeting, Cui Zhixin deliberately raised Luo Genqun's class status in order to avoid returning Luo Genqun's house. At that time, middle peasant Tao Laoer said, "Luo Genqun is an honest middle peasant, and there is no condition for struggle. The house should be returned." After the meeting, Cui Zhixin threatened, "Tao Laoer dares to raise my opinion, and one day I will detain you." This scared Tao Laoer sick and he didn't dare to go out. At this time, the work team had no choice but to replace the masses to "end land reform." Sometimes they criticized the branch committee members, but it was useless. They solicited the opinions of the masses, and the masses reflected, "Liu Fuheng and his gang are both cunning and selfish. You don't dare to do anything to them? We have no opinions." The work team wanted to launch criticism and self-criticism within the party, and everyone said, "The officials are scary, and the stones are crushing!" Activist Xu Qinghuai lamented, "A single tree does not make a forest, and a single island does not make a group." He asked the work team to support them, but these opinions were not heeded. As a result of the lack of democracy within the party, not only was the enthusiasm of the party members limited, but democracy was also limited among the masses, so that the masses felt that the work team was controlled by the cadres; the hired and poor peasants and new middle peasants could not be mobilized, and the work of ending land reform could not be carried out; the party could not be rectified well. After inspection, the Second District Committee recognized that the failure of the work in Guanzhuang had the following reasons: (1) It did not grasp the policy of party rectification, and could not seriously criticize and educate the erring party members who resisted party rectification; instead, it blindly regarded the resistance of party members as a burden and unloaded it for them, and even "admitted mistakes" to them; fantasizing about turning some resisters into activists. When the party members inside and outside the party asked the leadership to support them, they did not provide the necessary support, let alone politically and organizationally support the activists, resulting in alienation from the party members and the masses. (2) First of all, in the initial party rectification, the organizational line of party rectification was not implemented, relying on activists to achieve consciously launching criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, it caused the failure of the work. After the start of the land reform work, it did not start from mobilizing the poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants, uniting the middle peasants to carry out the work of investigating feudalism, investigating the turned-over peasants, investigating the fruits of over-occupation, and investigating deviations; but mistakenly relied on erring party members to carry out the work. Now the Second District Committee has decided that the work in Guanzhuang should indeed adjust the composition of the branch leadership to ensure the democratic rights of party members and the masses. Within the party, rely on activists, unite better elements, and launch criticism and self-criticism; outside the party, fully mobilize hired and poor peasants and new middle peasants, and unite the middle peasants to jointly carry out the work of ending land reform. Only then can the work in Guanzhuang be transformed.

### 官庄一味迁就党没整好　结束土改搞不下去

　　官庄一味迁就党没整好
  　结束土改搞不下去
    【太岳电】屯留二区官庄支部，建立于一九四六年，共有党员十二人，其中大部是中农，其余是小商人；四个支委都是小商人出身，在党内奸猾虚伪、自私自利，有严重侵犯人民利益的行为。初步整党是采用集训形式，检查出了侵犯人民利益的行为，并发现了四个积极分子，四个较好分子。这次工作组到村后支书张治生和丁文斌假装积极主动反映村里情况，刘恒富表示：“过去我思想上有包袱，现在已经卸下了，一定要好好干”。由于工作组不深入支部了解真实情况，加以分析研究；也不深入群众听取群众反映，就被这些假话迷惑了，认为这些人“能干”，结束土改也要靠他们来完成。在整党时虽然经过支部内民主选举了积极分子贾守义、宋克俭担任支委；但支书张治生却提出“他们只能跑个腿，还是先当个小组长吧！”就指定和他关系好的崔治信担任支委，工作组对此也表示赞同。这就引起支部内党员不满意。过了几天四个支委就抵抗结束土改工作，开会时有的故意皱着眉头一言不发，支书张治生就不参加会，派人叫了两次不来，工作组就亲自去叫；四个支委都说：“背上包袱了。”刘富恒欠差不支，还说不该批评；丁新斌、崔治信说：“工作组不该在会上提出他们阻挡群众发言的事情”。工作组同志却不是严肃的进行批评；而怕这几个支委情绪不高，就承认了“错误”，“一个一个地给卸包袱”。于是四个支委认为工作组脱离了他们干不成，就轮流抵抗起来。支书张治生说：“我们村尽是工商业问题，工作组就领导不起来”；丁文斌更讥刺工作组说：“玉茭秆不能当枪用”。工作组贾龙元同志问他们：“农会有六包袱胜利果实哪里去了？”支委崔治信等不但不检查自己的错误，退出非法多占的果实，反大骂：“没有这回事，简直是放屁！”使党内的批评与自我批评根本无法展开；党员一提出意见马上就被打击回去。如党员贾定义提出来：“群众反映崔治信强奸妇女，咱们应检讨一下”。支书张治生马上威胁道：“你知道？你敢负责？”积极分子朱克俭、徐庆怀提出：“刘富恒翻身过高，农会帐目不清，群众怀疑有贪污，应当清理一下”。刘富恒说：“走！马上到我家搜一下”。崔治信和张治生也都说：“当干部落了这个下场让他们干吧！”大家提出：“崔治信不应强买中农罗根群的房子，永兴煤窑已没他的股金了，还抽股五十五万元，这不对”。崔治信马上就拿上绳子要去寻死来威胁大家，工作组马上给崔治信说好话：“同志不要怕！群众意见不一定正确，有领导上给你作主”。象这样对有错误的党员迁就，并依靠他们来领导结束土改工作，当然使工作搞不下去，他们在研究别人问题时自己也表现积极，一连到本身问题就行不通了。如在群众大会上，崔治信为了怕退罗根群的房子，故意把罗根群的成份提高。当时中农陶老二说：“罗根群是个老实中农，斗的没条件，房子应该退”。会后崔治信就威胁道：“陶老二还敢提我的意见，总有一天要把你扣起来。”这样把陶老二吓病了，连门也不敢出。这时工作组没办法，只好代替群众来“结束土改”。有时也批评支委一番但无济于事。他们征求群众意见，群众反映说：“刘富恒那一伙伙，又奸、又私，你们还不敢怎么人家？我们更没意见”。工作组要党内展开批评与自我批评，大家说：“官大吓死人啦，石大压死人啦！”积极分子徐庆怀叹惜说：“孤树不成林，孤岛不成群”。要求工作组给大家作主，但这些意见却未被注意。由于党内没有民主的结果，不但限制了党员的积极性；并且在群众中限制了民主，使群众感到工作组是给干部掌握的；雇贫农、新中农发动不起来，结束土改作不下去；党也整不好。二区分委会检查后，认识到官庄工作的失败有以下几个原因：（一）没有掌握整党方针，对抵抗整党的犯错误党员不能严肃的进行批评与教育；而是一味把党员的抵抗当作包袱去给他们卸，甚至向他们“承认错误”；幻想把一些抵抗分子制造成积极分子。在党内党外要求领导作主撑腰时，反没有作必要的撑腰，更没有在政治上与组织上扶植积极分子，结果脱离了党员又脱离了群众。（二）首先在初步整党中没有贯彻了整党的组织路线，依靠积极分子达到自觉地展开批评与自我批评。所以造成了工作的失败。在土改工作开始后，没有从发动贫雇农新中农入手，团结中农进行查封建、查翻身、查多占果实、查纠偏工作等；而是错误的依靠犯错误的党员进行工作。现二区分委会决定：官庄工作应确实调整支部领导成份，保证党员与群众民主权利。党内依靠积极分子，团结较好分子，展开批评与自我批评；党外充分发动雇贫农、新中农，团结中农共同进行结束土改工作。才把官庄工作转变过来。
