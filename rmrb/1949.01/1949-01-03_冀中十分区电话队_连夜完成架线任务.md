【Jizhong-Tianjin Front, 26th Dispatch】Our reporter Li Ping reports: The telephone team of the Tenth District of Jizhong completed the task of laying 160 li of telephone lines. The communication between the front and rear is now smooth and unimpeded. After the sound of artillery fire for the liberation of Tianjin and Peiping, the order for general mobilization came, and the branch telephone team immediately took action to meet the task of setting up telephone lines to support the war. Liu Rusong and other comrades from the 11th Branch Bureau of the 11th Sub-district requested approval from their superiors to voluntarily come and participate in the great battle to liberate Tianjin and Peiping. They came from the rear, hundreds of miles away, their feet full of blisters, but they immediately started laying lines without resting, working continuously for 24 hours, walking and laying lines for 130 li, exceeding the original plan. A dozen comrades from the Tenth District Communications Section, who were recuperating in the rear, some with scabies all over their bodies and others still very weak, also forgot their fatigue and enthusiastically participated in the wiring work in response to the general mobilization order, regardless of their personal safety. Platoon leader Comrade Zhou Zhenbo received the order and rushed back 150 li overnight to carry out the wiring task. Telephone operator Comrade × Congjun ate three meals in three days and didn't sleep for three consecutive nights, his eyes bloodshot. The cart teams of Baxian and Xiongxian helped the telephone team pull poles and wires, and they said to the telephone team, "For the sake of fighting for Tianjin and Peiping, wherever you lay the lines, we will follow, and we will not go home until the task is completed!" In the cold night, they waded through the bone-chilling icy water of the Yongding River and transported the line poles to Hebei. The cold icy river water could not stop their enthusiasm for supporting the war. At dawn on the 11th, they returned across the Yongding River and rushed to the eastern front to carry out their mission.

　　冀中十分区电话队
  　连夜完成架线任务
    【冀中平津前线二十六日电】本社记者李萍报导：十分区电话队五十余人，完成了百六十里的架设电线的任务。前后方的联系已通畅无阻。这次解放平津的炮声响后，总动员令传来，分厂电话队立即行动起来迎接架设电线支援战争的任务。十一分区十一支局局员刘汝松等同志，请求上级批准，自愿赶来参加解放平津的大战。从相距数百里的后方赶来，走得满脚是泡，没肯休息就立即开始架线工作，连续工作一昼夜，连走带架线一百卅里，超过原计划。十分区通讯科在后方休养的十几个同志，有的身上长满了疥疮，有的身体还很弱，也忘掉了疲倦，响应总动员令，奋不顾身的踊跃参加架线工作。排长周振波同志接到命令，连夜赶了一百五十里地回来执行架线任务。电话员×从均同志三天吃了三顿饭，一连三宿没睡觉，眼都熬红了。霸县和雄县的大车队帮助电话队拉着杆子、电线，他们跟电话队说：“为着打平津，你们架到那里，我们跟到那里，完不成任务不回家！”就在寒冷的夜里，他们淌过了永定河刺骨的冰河水，把线杆运往河北。冷冰河水，挡不住他们支援战争的热情，十一日拂晓，他们又返过永定河来，赶到东线执行任务。
