To the Editor:

    I have two questions I would like answered:
    1. Is the "Communist Manifesto" the program of all communist parties worldwide, or is there a separate, specific document for the program of a communist party?
    2. What is the program of the Chinese Communist Party? Does such a document exist?

    A reader from Central Hebei, Liu Yong

Comrade Liu Yong:

    Regarding the questions you raised, our answers are as follows:

    Lenin said that a party program "is a concise and definite statement of all the goals that a political party wants to achieve and strive for." The Communist Manifesto is the general program followed by communist parties in all countries.

    The program of the Chinese Communist Party is the "General Program" in the Party Constitution. It explains the nature and theory of the Party, the nature, motive force, tasks, and characteristics of the Chinese revolution, the ideological struggle and self-criticism within the Party, as well as the Party's mass line and organizational principles.

专栏：

　　中国共产党的党纲是什么？编者同志：
    现在有两个问题请答复一下：
    一、“共产党宣言”为世界共产党党纲，是不是还有共产党党纲的专门文件呢？
    二、中国共产党的党纲是什么？有没有这个文件？
　　冀中读者  流永流永同志：
    关于你所提的问题，我们的解答是这样的：
    列宁说：党纲“便是一个政党所要达到，所要争取的一切目的之简明确实的叙述”。共产党宣言是世界各国共产党所遵循的总的纲领。
    中国共产党的党纲便是党章中的“总纲”。它说明了党的性质与理论，说明了中国革命的性质、动力、任务、特点，说明了党内的思想斗争和自我批评，以及党的群众路线和组织原则等。
