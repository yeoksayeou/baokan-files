Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 24th: TASS, Moscow: January 21st marked the 25th anniversary of the death of Lenin, the genius leader and teacher of the working people of the world and the great founder of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. Memorial meetings commemorating Lenin's death were held in factories, manufacturing plants, government offices, schools, collective farms, state-owned farms, and armed forces throughout the Soviet Union.

　　In Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, at 18:50 on the night of January 21st, a memorial meeting commemorating the 25th anniversary of Lenin's death was held at the Grand Theater, hosted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Moscow Committee, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, representatives of the Moscow Municipal Soviet, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, together with representatives of party, mass organizations, and Soviet troops. Peter Pospelov, editor-in-chief of "Truth," delivered a report at the meeting.

　　On this day, all newspapers in the Soviet Union published many commemorative messages and articles by famous political leaders and mass leaders commemorating Lenin. "Truth" published three previously unpublished Lenin documents. These are: Lenin's letter to Stalin on improving radio broadcasting, Lenin's letter to the Dutch left-wing Social Democrat Wijnkoop in July 1915 regarding preparations for the First World Congress of Internationalists, and a manuscript supplement to Lenin's statement to the German working people and non-exploiting peasants regarding the Treaty of Versailles. The Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, affiliated with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, noted: The last document is of particularly important significance in exposing the treacherous role of the current right-wing Social Democrats—the most ferocious enemies of the working class and loyal servants of the imperialist bourgeoisie.

  　纪念列宁逝世二十五周年
    真理报刊载三篇至今未发表的列宁文件
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：一月二十一日，是全世界劳动人民天才领袖与导师、布尔什维克党及苏维埃国家的伟大创建者——列宁逝世的二十五周年纪念日。全苏各地的工厂、制造厂、机关、学校、集体农场、国营农场和武装部队，均举行列宁逝世纪念会。
    在苏联首都莫斯科，二十一日夜十八时五十分，列宁逝世二十五周年纪念会在大戏院举行，由苏联共产党中央及莫斯科委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团、俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席团、莫斯科州市苏维埃代表以及共产主义青年团中央委员会、全苏职工会中央委员会主席团，会同党、群众团体及苏维埃部队的代表主持。真理报总编辑彼得·波斯伯洛夫在会上作报告。
    在这一天，全苏所有的报纸均发表了许多纪念的消息与著名的政治领袖与群众领袖纪念列宁的文章。真理报刊载了三篇至今仍未发表的列宁文件。这就是：列宁给斯大林关于增进无线电广播的信，一九一五年七月列宁给荷兰左翼社会民主党人温科普关于国际主义者第一次世界大会筹备事宜的信，以及列宁为凡尔塞和约事告德国劳动人民及非剥削农民书的手稿补遗。苏联共产党中央所属之马克思——恩格斯——列宁学院注称：最后一个文件，在揭露目前右翼社会民主党人——工人阶级最凶恶的敌人、帝国主义资产阶级的忠实奴仆——的叛逆之作用上，具有特别重要的意义。
