　　[Jizhong News] The Jizhong Military Region is commending the "Forward Unit" and the "Brave Unit" for their strict implementation of urban discipline policies while garrisoning Baoding and taking over Zhuoxian County, and is punishing Zhao Zhankui, political commissar Yin Zheng, and chief of staff Wu Jun of the "Protect the Fields Unit" for violating urban discipline, giving them a warning. To this end, the following circular is issued:
　　During the "Forward Unit's" operations in Baoyuan and its garrison duty in Baoding, and the "Brave Unit's" mission to take over Zhuoxian City, the leadership of both units emphasized urban discipline policies and repeatedly conducted mobilization, explanation, and education. As a result, cadres at all levels not only set an example themselves but also managed and inspected the troops. Soldiers were consciously disciplined, and the masses supervised each other. The troops entering the city strictly implemented the Party's various policies and entry discipline, achieving excellent results and creating many models of discipline and policy compliance. This gave our Party and our army an extremely positive image among the masses and won the praise of the people of Baoding and Zhuoxian for our army. At the same time, all officers and soldiers of the two units worked hard, were loyal to their duties, handed over all captured items to the public, did not take a single needle or thread from the people, and did not move a single blade of grass or tree. They protected public buildings, warehouses, schools, etc., enabling the rapid restoration of urban order. These achievements, in addition to being reported to the North China Military Region and the Regional Party Committee, are hereby commended by this circular.
　　In addition, when the "Protect the Fields Unit" entered Zhuoxian City this time, its leadership had a vague concept of discipline. After entering the city, the unit's chief of staff, Wu Jun, ordered the troops to take captured items indiscriminately. The unit's political commissar, Yin Zheng, and the unit's head, Zhao Zhankui, not only failed to stop this violation of organizational discipline but also took a sympathetic attitude without principle, resulting in poor discipline among the unit's troops entering the city. In order to educate the above three comrades, Chief of Staff Wu Jun, Political Commissar Yin Zheng, and Unit Head Zhao Zhankui are hereby given a warning by this circular. In this incident, the unit's political department director, Qi Zhicheng, and the first battalion's instructor, Ma Zhiqian, opposed the erroneous actions of their superiors and adhered to principles. Although their correct opinions were not accepted by the leadership, their spirit of daring to adhere to the truth is worthy of praise and is also hereby commended by this circular.

　　卫戍保定接管涿县纪律严明
  　“前进”“勇猛”两部荣获嘉奖
    “保田部”破坏纪律受警告处分
    【冀中讯】冀中军区奖励“前进部”和“勇猛部”卫戍保定时执行城市纪律政策的严格，并处分“保田部”首长赵占奎、政委殷征、参谋长武均破坏城市纪律，给予警告，为此，特发出如下之通令：
    此次“前进部”在保垣作战与担任保定卫戍任务中，以及“勇猛部”在接管涿县城任务中，由于该两部领导上重视了城市纪律政策，反复的进行了动员解释教育，所以各级干部不仅都能以身作则起带头作用，并能加以管理检查，战士们人人自觉，群众互相监督，使入城部队都严格的执行了党的各种政策和入城纪律，并作出优良成绩，创造出许多遵守纪律政策的模范；使我党我军，在群众中获得了极良好的影响，并博得了保定、涿县人民对我军的赞誉。同时该两部队全体指战员在保定与涿县卫戍期间，刻苦耐劳，忠于职守，缴获归公，不拿人民一针一线，未动群众一草一木，保护了公共建筑、仓库、学校等，使城市秩序很快得到恢复，这些成绩除呈报华北军区和区党委外，并特予以通令奖励。
    另外“保田部”此次入涿县城时，由于该部领导上对纪律观念模糊，入城后该部参谋长武均，竟命令部队乱拿缴获的东西，而该部政委殷征及该部首长赵占奎对这种违犯组织纪律的行动，不仅不加以制止，反而无原则的采取同情，致使该部入城部队纪律不好。为了教育以上三同志，特给予参谋长武均、政委殷征、该部首长赵占奎通令警告处分。在这一事件中，该部政治部主任齐志诚与一营教导员马志谦两同志，反对上级的错误行动，坚持了原则，虽然他们的正确意见，未被领导上接受，但这种敢于坚持真理的精神，是值得表扬的，亦特予以通令奖励。
