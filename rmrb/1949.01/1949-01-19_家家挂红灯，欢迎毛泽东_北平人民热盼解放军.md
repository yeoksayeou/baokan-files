Xinhua News Agency, Pingjiao, 17th. "Every house hangs red lanterns, welcoming Mao Zedong." This is a folk rhyme that has been widely circulating in Beiping recently. This shows how eagerly the people of Beiping, who are temporarily still under the ravages of the Jiang-Fu bandit gang, are waiting for the People's Liberation Army. Red lanterns are what the residents of Beiping have been forced to hang at their doors by the Jiang-Fu bandit gang for the past twenty-odd days to replace electric lighting. Although the People's Liberation Army has been supplying electricity to Beiping since the 27th of last month, Fu Zuoyi still refuses to release electricity to the general population. The people of Beiping are extremely disgusted with the Jiang-Fu bandits, who have become turtles in a jar. Everyone knows that the People's Liberation Army outside the city will be coming in soon. The most painful things for the people in the city now are: first, doing hard labor to demolish houses; second, the shortage of grain and coal, and high prices; and third, Fu Zuoyi's indiscriminate killing of people.

　　In order to facilitate their escape in the future, in addition to the two temporary airports already built in the city, on the 9th, the puppet mayor Liu Yaozhang announced the construction of a third large airport. In order to build the airport and the fortifications around the city, Fu Zuoyi forcibly ordered all men in the city between the ages of 18 and 45 to perform hard labor. Even teachers, cultural workers, and students were not exempt, otherwise they had to pay an exemption fee. Therefore, every day in Beiping city, there are teams of old and young people, dressed in different clothes, escorted by bandit soldiers and police to the hard labor camps. Due to the construction of airports and fortifications, Fu Zuoyi destroyed a large number of buildings and historical sites. The houses within 500 meters outside Xizhimen, Guang'anmen, and Chaoyangmen have been demolished, leaving tens of thousands of residents homeless. The centuries-old ancient cypresses and pines in the Temple of Heaven in the outer city have also been cut down by Fu Zuoyi.

　　The citizens in the city are short of grain and coal, and Fu Zuoyi has repeatedly ordered "grain donations." Grain prices have soared recently. On the 14th of last month, a bag of flour was worth 140 yuan in puppet gold yuan, but on the 10th of this month, it had risen to 1,350 yuan (equivalent to more than 4 billion old legal tender), an increase of nearly nine times in twenty days. A pound of cabbage now costs 40 yuan in puppet gold yuan (equivalent to 120 million legal tender). Some customers complained that the prices were too high, and the vendors said, "Still complaining it's too expensive! In a few days, I wouldn't even use this money to wipe my ass if you gave it to me for free!" Due to the plummeting value of the puppet gold yuan, the phenomenon of bartering goods on the market is very common; silver dollars have also flooded the market, and the ratio of puppet gold yuan to silver dollars has fallen to 500 to 1 (the Kuomintang government originally stipulated it as 10 to 1).

　　The Jiang-Fu bandit gang has recently been killing people frequently. An old woman in her sixties outside Chaoyangmen was beaten to death by bandit soldiers for opposing the bandits' demolition of her house. A rickshaw puller outside Xizhimen was beaten to death by secret agents for saying, "Fu Zuoyi is still so bad at this time of year" because he was dissatisfied with the unreasonable oppression by the bandit soldiers. Under the direction of the bandit leaders, secret agent students from Chaoyang University and China University openly organized so-called "special criminal courts" on campus, arbitrarily arresting, interrogating, and massacring students. In order to suppress the people, Chu Xichun recently openly called for "borrowing heads," advocating "killing people decisively." On the 5th, the bandits conducted a large-scale household registration check, arresting nearly a thousand innocent citizens.

　　However, the Kuomintang bandits also know that the situation is over, and they have purchased plain clothes and forged ID cards to prepare for their escape in the future. Some secret agents have begun to lie low, and some have disguised themselves as refugees and mixed out of the city in an attempt to escape. The puppet Beiping Municipal Government has burned the household registration books. The citizens of Beiping believe that the Kuomintang bandits' intensified construction of fortifications is futile. They say, "So many steel and cement bunkers were built outside the city, but they didn't work. Now these are just a waste of effort and a waste of money!"

### “家家挂红灯，欢迎毛泽东”　北平人民热盼解放军

　　“家家挂红灯，欢迎毛泽东”
  　北平人民热盼解放军
    【新华社平郊十七日电】“家家挂红灯，欢迎毛泽东。”这是最近广泛流传在北平城里的民谣。这表示出暂时仍在蒋傅匪帮蹂躏下的北平人民是以多么热切的心情在等待着人民解放军。红灯是北平居民最近廿余日来在蒋傅匪帮强迫下家家户户必须挂在门口以代替电灯照明的。虽然从上月廿七日起解放军已向北平城内送电，但至最近为止，傅匪作义仍不肯放电给一般人民。北平人民对于已成壅中之鳖的蒋傅匪徒憎恶万分，大家都知道城外的解放军不久就要进来。城内人民现在最痛苦的事：一是做拆屋子的苦工；二是粮煤缺，物价高；三是傅匪乱杀人。匪首们为了将来逃跑的便利，除在城内已修好两个临时飞机场外，九日伪市长刘瑶章又宣布赶筑第三个大机场。为了修筑机场及环城工事，傅匪强令城内十八岁以上四十五岁以下的男子均须服苦役，文教人员及学生均不能免，否则须交免役费。因此北平城内每天都有老老少少、衣着各异的队伍由匪军警押赶苦役场。由于筑飞机场和工事，傅匪破坏了大批的建筑和古迹。西直门、广安门、朝阳门等门外五百公尺以内的民房都已拆光，成千成万的居民流离失所。外城天坛内的数百年古柏、苍松也被傅匪砍光。城内市民粮煤均缺，傅匪尚一再勒令“捐粮”。粮价近日飞涨，上月十四日面粉一袋值伪金圆券一百四十元，本月十日已涨至一千三百五十元（合旧法币四十亿多），二十天中上涨近九倍。一斤白菜现需伪金圆券四十元（合法币一亿二千万元）。有些顾客嫌物价太贵，商贩们说：“还嫌贵！过几天这票子白送给我擦屁股也不要！”由于伪金圆券暴跌，市场上以货易货的现象非常普遍；银元又充斥市场，伪金圆券与银元之比率已跌至五百比一（国民党政府原规定为十比一）。蒋傅匪帮近经常杀人，朝阳门外一个六十多岁的老太婆因反对匪徒们拆她的房屋，被匪军活活打死。西直门外一个三轮车夫因不满匪军无理压迫而说了一句“到了这个年头傅作义还这样坏”，当时即被特务打死。朝阳大学及中国大学之特务学生在匪首指使下，竟公然在校内组织所谓“特种刑庭”，任意拘捕、审讯与大杀学生。为了镇压人民，楚匪溪春近曾公开号召“借人头”，主张“杀人要杀得干脆”。五日匪徒们曾大举检查户口，逮捕无辜市民近千。但国民党匪徒们也知道大势已去，已纷纷购置便衣、作假身份证，准备将来逃跑。有些特务已开始潜伏，有些已伪装难民混出城外，企图逃走。伪北平市政府已烧毁了户口册子。北平市民对国民党匪徒们之加紧构筑工事认为是徒然。他们说：“城外修了那么多的钢骨水泥碉堡都没顶事，现在这些还不是白费力气，劳民伤财！”
