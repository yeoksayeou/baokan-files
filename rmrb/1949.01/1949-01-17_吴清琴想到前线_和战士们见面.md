Dear Northeast People's Liberation Army brothers:
	You eliminated more than a million of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the Northeast for the liberation of all the people of China, completely liberating the people of the Northeast. You are not afraid of hardship and helped the North China People's Liberation Army liberate Peiping and Tianjin. I was so happy to hear this news. I wish you certain victory. I really want to go to the front lines to meet you and comfort you, but this idea cannot be realized, which really disappoints me. We are about to take exams, so my wish cannot be fulfilled. I think disappointment and pessimism are useless. I only hope that you will liberate Beiping and Tianjin soon. At that time, we can hold a celebration meeting together. How happy would that be!
	Let's talk another day. Wishing
	You Certain Victory

　　吴清琴想到前线
  　和战士们见面亲爱的东北解放军大哥：
    你们为了解放全中国的人民，在东北消灭了蒋匪一百多万，使东北的人民完全得到解放，你们不怕劳苦，又帮助华北解放军解放平津，我听到这个消息，真是高兴极了。我祝你们一定胜利，我很想到前线，和你们见一面，慰劳你们，但是这个想法不可能实现，真使我失望，我们眼看就要考试了，达不到我的志愿。我想失望悲观是没有用的，我现在只希望你们很快的解放北平天津。到那个时候，咱们在一起开个庆祝大会，你想是多么快乐呀！
    改日再谈吧，敬祝
    你们一定胜利
