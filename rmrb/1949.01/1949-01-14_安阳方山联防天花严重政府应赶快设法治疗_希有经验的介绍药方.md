Criticism and Suggestions

　　In the four administrative villages of the Fangshan Joint Defense Area, Seventh District of Anyang, most children are suffering from smallpox, especially those aged one or two. In the two streets of Fangshan Village alone, with over fifty households, more than sixteen children have died from smallpox in less than two months. Some households even lost two children. A few adults in their thirties have also contracted smallpox. People have been asking doctors to treat the children, but it is mostly ineffective. The characteristics of the smallpox are: when a child falls ill, they initially develop a high fever all over their body. After the fever, red bumps appear, and they die within six or seven days. Some die before the red bumps even appear. The masses are saying, "There's no cure for this." Some are burning incense and kowtowing, asking gods and spirits to cure them. Regarding the above situation, we hope that people with experience in treating this disease can introduce some methods. I think this matter cannot be ignored.

　　安阳方山联防天花严重政府应赶快设法治疗　希有经验的介绍药方
    安阳七区方山联防四个行政村，大部分村的小孩都生天花。以一二岁为最多。仅方山村的二个街五十余户，不到二个月，就因生天花死了十六个小孩。还有一户死两个的。另有少数卅多岁的大人也生起了天花。老百姓也请医生给小孩治疗，但大部无效。天花的特点是：小孩一生病，开始满身发烧，烧罢就生红疙瘩，到六七天头上就死了。有的不到生红疙瘩就死了。群众都说：“这没法治”，有的烧香叩头，请神鬼治。上述情况，请对治这病有经验的人给介绍一下，我想这一件事是不容忽视的。
