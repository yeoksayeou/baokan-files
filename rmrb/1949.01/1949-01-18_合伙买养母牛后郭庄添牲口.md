　　After Jointly Buying a Cow, Guo Village Adds Livestock
    [Jinan News] Houguo Village is a small, poor village in the western half of the Fourth District of Handan. The whole village has 56 households with 258 people, and 1,400 mu of land. In the year the Japanese devils surrendered, the whole village had only 17 livestock of all sizes, making it very difficult for the masses to cultivate the land. Most of the land was plowed by human power or dug up with hoes. Usually, grinding rice and flour also required people to push the mill.
    After Handan was liberated in 1945, a turnaround movement was carried out in the wheat season of the following year. The farmers' land returned to their homes, and it was necessary to greatly develop production, but the lack of livestock became a major difficulty in production. In order to solve this difficulty, the new village chief, Liu Tingchen, advocated that everyone jointly buy livestock. Within a year, the number increased from 17 to 35, and 7 cows were bought to breed livestock. In order to further develop to the point where every household had livestock, all the livestock were organized into 17 double-harness carts for transportation, and the money earned was used to help others. Households buying livestock could borrow money to buy livestock, and repay it in installments without affecting their production and life, or repay it with grain after the autumn and wheat seasons. Jiao Wenli, Jiao Wenyi and others each bought a cow in this way. In addition, the seven cows bred ten calves in more than a year. As of November last year, the number of livestock in the village had increased to 59, more than one per household. The whole village is now engaged in transportation and is preparing to replace all the cattle with mules.

　　合伙买养母牛后郭庄添牲口
    【冀南讯】后郭庄是邯郸四区西半部的一个小穷村，全村共五十六户，二百五十八口人，土地一千四百亩。日寇投降那年，全村只剩大小牲口十七头，群众耕地很困难。多数地是用人力拉犁或＠头掘起来的。平常吃个米、面也要人推磨。
    一九四五年邯郸解放后，第二年麦季进行了翻身运动，农民土地回了家，须要大量发展生产，可是牲口太少，成为生产中很大的困难。为解决这个困难，新村长刘廷臣提倡大家合伙买牲口。一年内，由十七头增加到三十五头，还买了七头母牛，准备繁殖牲口。为了进一步发展到家家有牲口，又把所有牲口组成十七辆双套车搞运输，赚了钱共同帮助别人。买牲口户借到款买下牲口后，在不影响其生产与生活下，零还、或到秋、麦季打下粮食再还。焦文礼、焦文义等都是这样每人买到一头牛。另外七头母牛，在一年多时间繁殖小牛十头。截至去年十一月，全村牲口已增加到五十九头，每户合一头还多。现全村正在搞运输，并准备把所有的牛都换成骡子。
