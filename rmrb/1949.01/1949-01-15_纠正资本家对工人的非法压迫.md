　　Correcting Capitalists' Illegal Oppression of Workers
　　Recently, in some areas, a few capitalists have been illegally oppressing workers. They unilaterally distort our Party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce. Our policy is "benefit both labor and capital," but they only consider the interests of their own capitalist side, completely disregarding and arbitrarily depriving workers of their legitimate interests. This phenomenon will seriously harm the development of New Democratic industry and commerce and cannot be allowed to continue.
　　During the land reform, some places confiscated and distributed the industrial and commercial enterprises of landlords and old-style rich peasants. We considered this to be wrong and immediately corrected it. However, some capitalists took advantage of the correction to retaliate against workers, adopting various extremely unreasonable measures. We warned them that this was illegal and must not continue. Recently, this kind of illegal oppression of workers has occurred again, such as the actions of Jiu Xingwu and other tobacco shops in Xingtai City, who used unemployment, starvation, extended working hours, restricted workers' freedom, bought off individual backward workers to divide worker unity, and stipulated extremely unreasonable "shop rules," attempting to strangle workers in order to achieve their unreasonable exploitation and oppression. The result of this will inevitably arouse workers' resentment and resistance, and if it develops, it will affect labor-capital relations, affect production, and seriously hinder the normal development of industry and commerce.
　　The reason for this phenomenon is, on the one hand, the exploitative and speculative nature of some savage capitalists, but on the other hand, it is mainly due to some local leaders' one-sided understanding of the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, only paying attention to protecting the interests of industrial and commercial capitalists, while ignoring the interests of workers. From the perspective of a Communist Party member, this is a lack of Party spirit and a loss of class standing; from the perspective of an ordinary government worker, it is also a violation of the general line of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In some places, in the process of correcting deviations, workers were not well mobilized and relied upon to consciously correct deviations, but instead, cadres took over everything, which seriously affected and struck at workers' morale and fueled unreasonable demands and actions by capitalists. This point should be deeply reviewed and seriously noted by relevant departments in various regions.
　　We propose the following opinions on the handling of incidents similar to the Jiu Xingwu tobacco shop in Xingtai City: (1) The "shop rules" of the shop have not been truly negotiated with the workers and violate the basic rights of workers, and should be ordered to be abolished. (2) For workers who have been dismissed by various factories without cause, the factory should reinstate their work according to the agreement, pay back the wages during the dismissal period, and apologize to the workers. (3) The government should, together with the trade union, give appropriate treatment to the factory's illegal acts according to the severity of the circumstances.

### 纠正资本家对工人的非法压迫

　　纠正资本家对工人的非法压迫
    近来有些地方发生少数资本家非法压迫工人的事情。他们片面地歪曲我党保护与发展工商业的政策，我们的政策是“劳资两利”，而他们则是只顾自己资方一方面底利益，而根本不管并且任意剥夺工人底正当利益。这种现象将严重地危害新民主主义工商业的发展，是不能容许其继续发展的。
    在土地改革中某些地方曾对地主和旧式富农的工商业，加以没收分配，这我们认为是不对的，旋即加以纠正。但有些资本家即在那时就利用纠偏，乘机向工人进行过报复，采取过种种极不合理的手段，我们曾警告过他们这是违法的，不得继续发生。近来又发生此种非法压迫工人的现象，如象邢台市久兴武等烟店所作的，以失业、饥饿、延长工作时间，限制工人自由，收买个别落后工人来分裂工人团结，规定极不合理的“号规”等，他们妄图以此扼住工人，以达其无理剥削与压迫的目的。而这样作的结果势必引起工人的愤懑和反抗，发展下去则将影响劳资关系，影响生产，严重阻碍工商业的正常发展。
    其所以发生这种现象的原因，一方面是由于某些野蛮的资本家的剥削投机性所使然，但另一方面，则主要是由于某些地主的领导者对保护与发展工商业政策片面了解，只注意保护工商业资本家的利益，而忽视了工人的利益，从一个共产党员来说，是没有党性，失掉阶级立场的作法；从一个普通的政府工作人员来说，他也是违反无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的总路线的做法。有些地方在纠偏中并未很好地发动工人、依靠工人底自觉去纠正偏向，而是干部一手包办代替，以致严重影响与打击了工人情绪，助长了资本家不合理的要求和行动。此点应引起各地有关机关深刻检讨和严重注意。
    我们对类似邢台市久兴武烟店这种事件的处理提出以下意见：（一）该号之“号规”既未真正与工人协议，且违反工人基本权利，应令其宣布作废。（二）对各厂无故被解雇的工人，厂方应依约恢复其工作，补发被解雇期间的工资并向工人道歉。（三）政府应协同工会对厂方之非法行为依情节之轻重分别予以适当处置。
