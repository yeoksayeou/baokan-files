　　Zhuoxian County Liberated Within a Week
  　All Primary and Secondary Schools Resume Classes
    [Zhang Yuan Telegraph] After the liberation of Zhuoxian County, under the democratic government's policy of protecting and developing culture and education and uniting intellectuals, all schools in the city, including one middle school, one simplified normal school, seven complete primary schools, and a branch (junior primary) of one complete primary school, resumed classes within a week of liberation. The People's Education Center, which was most severely damaged by the traitorous Fu forces, has also been restored. Forty-eight faculty members from five complete primary schools remain in their positions, and 991 students have returned to school. Sixteen faculty members and 105 students have returned to the middle school and simplified normal school. Faculty members and students who were hiding in various places when the traitorous Fu forces fled are now registering. The rapid resumption of classes in the city's schools is mainly due to four reasons: First, the Party's urban policy and the policy of protecting culture and education and uniting intellectuals were correctly implemented. At the beginning of our army's entry into the city, sentries were stationed to protect cultural and educational institutions, and a symposium of faculty members was held, a propaganda group was organized to promote to the schools, and the original faculty members were assisted in establishing an education preparatory committee, calling on them to effectively manage the schools and quickly resume classes. Second, a regular leadership system was quickly established with clear division of labor. In schools where the principal and director of studies fled with the enemy, enthusiastic educators were selected from among the faculty members. Faculty members maintained their original positions with clearly defined responsibilities. At the beginning of the resumption of classes, the original system should not be greatly changed, so that the original faculty members feel that the order is good and the work is easy to start, which makes it easy to give play to their enthusiasm, and then gradually transform it. Third, school funding and faculty salaries should be investigated as soon as possible to understand the past situation. In accordance with the principle of original position and original salary, strive to pay on time to solve the family life difficulties of faculty members and make them feel at ease in their work. Fourth, the new democratic education policy and our Party's policy towards intellectuals should be repeatedly publicized and explained, and symposiums should be held at certain times to expose the enemy's destruction of culture and education and intellectuals. Expose the enemy's deceptive propaganda and establish the correct understanding of faculty members.

　　涿县解放一周内
  　中小学校全部复课
    【张垣电】涿县城解放后，在民主政府保护与发展文化教育团结知识分子的方针下，全城一所中学，一所简师，七处完小，一个完小的分校（初小），在解放后一周内全部复课。为傅匪破坏最厉害的民教馆，也已恢复起来。五个完小的四十八名教职员依然供职，九百九十一名学生已到校上课，中学、简师已到教职员十六人，到校学生一百零五人。傅匪逃窜时隐藏在各处的教职员学生，现正陆续报到中。该城学校所以能迅速复课，主要原因有四：一、正确地执行了党的城市政策和保护文化教育、团结知识分子的政策。我军入城之初，就对文化教育机关布置岗哨，严加保护，并召开了教职员座谈会，组织了宣传小组到各校宣传，并帮助原有教职员成立了教育筹备会，号召切实看管学校和迅速复课。二、迅速树立起了正规的领导制度，明确分工。有的学校校长与教导主任随敌逃走，便从教职员当中选拔了热心教育的人士。教职员各按原职，职责分明。学校复课开始时，原有制度不要大变，使原有教职员感到秩序好，工作好下手，就容易发挥其积极性，以后再逐渐改造。三、学校经费，教职员薪金，应抓紧时间，及早调查，了解过去的情形。根据原职原薪原则，争取按时发给，以解决教职员家庭生活困难，使其安心工作。四、对新民主主义的教育方针与我党对知识分子的政策，应反复宣传解释，并在一定的时间召开座谈会，揭发敌人对文化教育和对知识分子的摧残。揭穿敌人的欺骗宣传，树立教职员的正确认识。
