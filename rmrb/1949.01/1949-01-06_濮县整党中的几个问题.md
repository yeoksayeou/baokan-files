Several Problems in the Party Rectification in Pu County
    Yao Fu, Han Qing

The Party rectification work in Pu County, which started in September, has initially unfolded criticism and self-criticism in key villages over the past two months. Branch committees in general villages have also conducted self-examinations, revealing many facts about impure work styles, and exposing some instances of organizational impurity. Individual branches have purged turncoats, maintaining the purity of the organization; some party members, after self-reflection, have returned excess land occupied, improving the relationship between the party and the masses. As a result, among the 231 villages in the county, 179 villages have clarified land rights, stabilizing and improving the production enthusiasm of all classes. As for the shortcomings in the work, as the county committee reviewed at the enlarged cadre meeting in mid-November, due to insufficient understanding of the significance and direction of the Party rectification work, they worried that party members would "lie down" because of the rectification, and worried that the masses would raise opinions, which dampened the enthusiasm of the party members. They never dared to publicly announce the Party rectification to the party members and the masses, but only allowed the party members to carry out the rectification "unconsciously," and did not mention the Party rectification to the masses at all. Secondly, they regarded one point of the content of the Party rectification—reflecting on and returning excess occupation—as the entirety of the Party rectification, ignoring the need to improve the Party in all aspects during the rectification, so that party members can carry out various tasks with correct ideology and work style, and build the Party into a mass party.

According to Comrade Sun Mingsan, the county secretary, the reason why these problems occurred in this period of work is that they misunderstood the district party committee's statement that "the success or failure of the Party rectification should be judged by the morale of the cadres after the rectification" (the success or failure of the rural Party rectification mainly depends on whether the relationship between the Party and the masses has improved and become closer after the rectification. This statement itself is also inappropriate. - Editor). Everything was considered from the perspective of not affecting the morale of the cadres, so when they thought that publicizing the Party rectification would make the party members unhappy, they decided not to mention the Party rectification to the party members and the masses, but only to combine it with determining land rights, conducting self-examination, and achieving as much as possible.

Afraid of "Affecting the Morale of Party Members," They Dared Not Publicize the Party Rectification

In this way, some problems occurred in the work over the past two months.

It is right to ask party members to reflect on and return excess land occupied, and this problem must be solved in the Party rectification; but it is inappropriate to stop the Party rectification work here, especially without raising it to the ideological level for resolution. In fact, once criticism and self-criticism were launched within the branch, problems in all aspects were brought up. According to statistics of 47 party members in ten villages in four districts, 118 facts such as sheltering landlords and rich peasants, ideological wavering, corruption and over-occupation, and coercion and command were reflected. Faced with such numerous problems, the county committee did not consciously grasp the solution, but only partially dealt with some problems in key villages, and did not pay much attention to them in general villages, still only solving the problem of over-occupied land. According to County Secretary Sun Mingsan, if the county committee had a clear understanding at the time, the problems that had already been exposed would have been resolved more appropriately.

It is right for the county committee to cherish the morale of the cadres. However, it did not distinguish what is true cherishing, what kind of cadres to cherish, and what kind of cadre morale to cherish, so sometimes it became unprincipled accommodation, and thus the Party rectification policy of "through the original branch" was turned into simply relying on all the original village cadres to carry out the Party rectification, ignoring the need to first discover and unite with activists and better elements, and absorb them into leadership. Gao Xibo, the instructor of Gaotakou in the first district (responsible for overall work), sheltered rich peasants, engaged in corruption and over-occupation, was fond of eating and lazy, and was seriously divorced from the masses. At the branch meeting, a group of people headed by him and a group of people headed by farmer association chairman Gao Weibin attacked each other, arguing back and forth, making it difficult for ordinary party members to interrupt. Militia squad leader Gao Shide said, "It's early, this faction, that faction, can't be done well in a thousand lifetimes." Therefore, as soon as he heard the two sides arguing, he @ left. Because the district committee leadership failed to unite the activists and better elements to make them a leading force and transform the branch leadership, these phenomena could not be overcome, turning the serious Party rectification work into unprincipled quarrels for a time. More seriously, unprincipled attitudes were also adopted towards turncoats. Feng Chuanxiu, the deputy village chief of Fengtakou, engaged in corruption and over-occupation during the land reform, and forcibly occupied the land of middle peasants. When the Chiang bandit's Fifth Army invaded, he was captured and defected, reporting six guns to the enemy, causing several families of militiamen to be beaten by the enemy. At the branch meeting, despite repeated education, he still insisted on his mistakes. The district committee of the Second District accepted the unanimous request of all party members in the village and decided to expel him from the Party, but the county committee replied, "Postpone the handling to avoid affecting the morale of the cadres." It was not until the district party committee pointed out the county committee's ideological mistakes that the application of the second district committee was approved. However, until now, Feng still holds his original position as deputy village chief. According to Secretary Wang Linchun of the branch, on November 28, because the Party rectification was not publicized, it was impossible to announce it to the masses, so he was not dismissed from his post, and he is still being kept quiet.

Although the policy of publicizing the Party rectification was determined at the recent enlarged cadre meeting of the county, because the idea of "fear of affecting the morale of cadres" was not thoroughly criticized, many cadres still came up with many practices that were essentially closed-door Party rectification after arriving in the village. Li Zhaohua, a cadre in the First District, proposed to use "administrative name" to rectify the Party, that is to say: the masses can only raise opinions to "village chiefs," "farmer association chairmen," etc., but not to "party members," and the Party still cannot be public. Old Branch Secretary Zhang of Liuyuan Township advocated: publicize some, keep some secret, whoever wants to publicize can publicize, and those who don't want to publicize can keep it secret. Sun Zaijun, a cadre of the farmer association in the First District, represented another opinion, the method is to first make the party members form a group, and if someone "finds loopholes" (raises opinions), they will all go together to explain, in order to block the mouths of the masses. These wrong ideas were not discussed, criticized, and ideologically resolved, but were taken into the work confusedly.

Will Publicizing the Party Rectification Collapse the Branch? To answer this question, the reporter investigated three types of branches.

Will Publicizing the Party Rectification Collapse the Branch?

The Nanxingzipu Branch of the Fourth District is the first type of branch. At the beginning, general district cadres thought that publicizing the Party rectification was a big problem, but after investigation and analysis, among nearly 40 party members, half were willing to publicize the rectification; only five were unwilling to publicize the rectification. Even for these few people, according to Gu Ming, deputy secretary of the branch committee, if the work is done well, there is not much problem. Among the 34 party members of the Hongmiao Branch of the First District (the second type of branch), ten were willing to publicize the rectification, nine were indifferent, and fifteen were unwilling. In the Gaotakou Branch of the First District, the third type of branch, eight were willing to publicize the rectification, sixteen were indifferent, and twenty-four were unwilling to publicize.

Now, there are three attitudes towards publicizing the Party rectification: the more enlightened and upright party members are willing to publicize the Party rectification. Some of them feel that "after publicizing the rectification, they will not dare to make mistakes in the future." Some, although they have made major mistakes, also want to rectify and get rid of the burden, and at the same time feel that "if it is not publicized, the masses will also know that they are party members," so they also advocate publicizing. This part of the people, plus those in the middle state, accounts for the majority of the party members, and those who are unwilling to publicize are the minority. And there are two situations among them: one is due to insufficient education and ideological ambiguity; some are afraid that the Chiang bandits will come again and the world will change; some are afraid of retaliation by bad people; some women are afraid of interference from their families. Among the 24 party members who are unwilling to publicize in the Gaodikou Branch, there are 14 female party members with this concern. Some are afraid that after publicizing, they will have to take the lead in work and it will delay work; some are afraid of being elected as cadres after publicizing. Only a very small number are afraid that the masses will raise opinions due to their own mistakes or major mistakes and poor awareness, and threaten the district cadres with "I will not do it if I publicize the rectification" to resist the Party rectification.

Lying down was a problem that had occurred. If we do not look at the specific environment and branch situation now, and do not carry out certain ideological preparations within the branch, but rashly and suddenly go to publicize the Party rectification, problems will indeed occur. However, the phenomenon of lying down that occurred in the past was complicated. Some were due to a lack of understanding of the correct Party rectification policy; some were resisting the Party rectification because they had committed major mistakes; some joined the Party to avoid struggle, and as soon as the end of land reform was announced, they stopped working. It is extremely wrong to attribute these situations to Party rectification in general without analyzing them, and to think that Party rectification will cause party members to lie down.

Why Did These Deviations Occur?

So, why did these deviations occur? This is inseparable from the denial of the Party rectification achievements by some county and district cadres. A county committee comrade told reporters: "It was left when rectifying; it was right when reconsidering, and there is no way to talk about the achievements of Party rectification." The reporter has seen such things more than once: some county and district committee comrades like to talk about the stories of the beginning of the Party rectification of county and district cadres. At that time, some comrades who were expelled, placed on probation within the Party, and removed from their posts asked each other what their surnames were when they got together, and replied: "Expelled," "Probation," "Removed." Then they gathered together, calling each other "family," and laughing heartily to express their dissatisfaction with the Party rectification. They do not correctly estimate the achievements of the Party rectification. When affirming the past achievements, some comrades only talk about the achievements of the land reform, and rarely mention or do not mention the achievements of the Party rectification. This is the ideological root of the consciousness of unprincipled accommodation to subordinates. If cadres do not have a correct understanding of the Party rectification, they will not do well in leading the Party rectification.

These shortcomings in the Party rectification work in Pu County in the previous stage existed to varying degrees in the areas north of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District. In Chiping County of the Sixth District Committee, the Party rectification was only to "kick the bottom" (let party members understand the policy, neither beat nor pull) and "call them up" (restore work morale). In Liaocheng, Yu Zhendong, a member of the county committee and secretary of the Fifth District, accommodated the morale of some party members in Zhangfeizhuang and even guaranteed them that there would be no Party rectification. Some cadres in Shanghe (New County) of the Eighth District Committee used the method of Party rectification to "muddle through" for village cadres, as long as the village cadres did their work. Some cadres in Kunwu believed that as soon as Party rectification was mentioned, cadres would lie down. Therefore, it is necessary to raise this issue seriously.

　　濮县整党中的几个问题
    药夫　寒青
    从九月开始的濮县整党工作，两个月来，在重点村初步展开了批评与自我批评，一般村的支委也作了检讨，反省出不少作风不纯的事实，某些组织不纯的现象也暴露了出来。个别支部清洗了叛变分子，保持了组织的纯洁性；有的党员经过反省，退出多占土地，改善了党群关系。因而全县二百三十一个村子，有一百七十九个村子确定了地权，稳定与提高了各阶层的生产情绪。至于工作中的缺点，则如十一月中旬全县扩大干部会上县委所检讨的，由于对整党工作的意义与方针认识不足，而耽心党员因整党而躺下，耽心群众提意见，打击了党员情绪，一直没有敢于向党员、群众公开宣布整党，只是让党员在“不知不觉”中进行整党，对群众则根本不提整党的事情。其次，把整党内容的一点——反省退出多占——当作了整党的全部，忽视了要在整党中，从各方面把党提高一步，使党员能以正确的思想作风进行各种工作，把党建设成为群众性的党。
    这段工作之所以发生这些问题，据县书孙明三同志告记者，原因是对区党委所说“整党成绩的好坏，要从整党后干部情绪好坏上看”这句话，发生误解（农村整党成绩的好坏，主要看整党后党与群众的关系是否改善与更加密切。这句话本身也是不妥当的。——编者），一切从不影响干部情绪着眼，所以当他们想到公开整党会使党员不愉快时，便决定在党员与群众间都不提整党的事，只提结合确定地权，检讨检讨，能够收到多少成绩就算多少。
    怕“影响党员情绪”不敢公开整党
    这样，两个月来的工作就出了一些毛病。
    要求党员反省与退出多占土地，这是对的，整党中必须解决这一问题；但把整党工作止于此，特别是不把它提到思想上加以解决，则就不妥了。实际上，当支部里面一经展开批评与自我批评，就把各方面的问题拉出来了。据四个区十个村四十七个党员的统计，反省出包庇地富，思想动摇，贪污多占，强迫命令等一百十八件事实。面对着这样繁多的问题，县委未曾有意识地抓紧解决，只在重点村部分地处理了一些问题，在一般村就没怎么管它，仍只解决多占土地问题。据县书孙明三同志谈，当时县委如果思想明确，已经暴露出来的问题是会得到更适当解决的。
    县委要爱护干部情绪，这是对的。但没有区别什么才叫真正的爱护，爱护什么样的干部，爱护什么样的干部情绪，因而有的时候就变成无原则的迁就，并因此把“经过原有支部”的整党方针，弄成简单地依靠一切原有村干进行整党，而忽视了首先发现与团结积极分子与较好分子，并吸收他们参加领导。一区高塔口指导员（负责全面工作）高希波，包庇富农，贪污多占，好吃懒做，严重脱离群众。支部会上，以他为首的一批人，和以农会长高维本为首的一批人，互相攻击，吵来吵去，弄得一般党员插不上嘴。民兵班长高士德说：“早呢，这一派，那一派，一千辈子也搞不好。”因此他一听两下吵闹，就＠走了。由于区委领导上，没有团结积极分子与较好分子使之成为领导力量，改造支部领导，因而这些现象就没法克服，使严肃的整党工作，一时变为无原则的吵闹。更严重的是对叛变分子也曾采取无原则的态度。冯塔口副村长冯传修，土改中贪污多占，强霸中农的土地。蒋匪第五军犯境时，被捕变节，向敌人报告了六支枪，使几个民兵家属遭敌殴打。支部会上，虽再三教育，他仍坚持错误。二区区委接受全村党员一致的要求，决定开除其党籍，县委却答以“暂缓处理，以免影响干部情绪”。直到区党委指出县委思想上的错误，二区区委的申请才被批准。可是直到现在，冯依然担任副村长原职。据分书王林春同志十一月二十八日谈，因为不公开整党，没法向群众宣布，所以没撤职，现在还闷着哩。
    最近全县扩大干部会上，虽然确定了公开整党的方针，但因“怕影响干部情绪”的思想没做彻底批判，到村后仍有不少干部，想出许多实质上还是关门整党的作法。一区干部李兆华提议用“行政名义”整党，就是说：群众只能是向“村长”、“农会长”等提意见，而不能是向“党员”提意见，党还是不能公开的。柳园乡老支委张某主张：公开一部分，秘密一部分，谁愿意公开就公开，不愿意公开的秘密起来。一区农会干部孙在均代表另一种意见，办法是先使党员抱成一个团体，要有人“钻空子”（提意见），就一齐去解释，以便堵住群众的嘴巴。这些错误思想，没有展开讨论、批判、从思想上求得解决，糊里糊涂带到工作中去了。
    公开整党会不会把支部整垮？为解答这一问题，记者调查了三种类型的支部。
    公开整党会不会把支部整垮？
    四区南杏子铺支部是第一类支部。开头，一般区干部认为公开整党是个大问题，后经调查分析，在近四十个党员中，有二分之一愿意公开整；只有五个不愿意公开整。即令这几个人，据分委副书记谷明谈，如果工作作得好，也没有多大问题。一区红庙支部（第二类支部）的三十四个党员，愿意公开整的十人，无所谓的九人，不愿意的十五人。第三类支部的一区高塔口支部，愿意公开整的八人，无所谓的十六人，不愿意公开的二十四人。
    现在看，对待公开整党有三种态度：觉悟较高的正派的党员，都愿意公开整党。他们有的觉得“公开整整，以后就不敢犯错误了”。有的虽有较大错误，但也想整整，去掉包袱，同时觉得“不公开，群众也知道自己是党员”，所以也主张公开。这部分人加上中间状态的人，占了党员的多数，不愿公开的则是少数。而他们中间又有两种情况：一种人是由于教育不够，思想模糊；有的怕蒋匪再来，变了天；有的怕坏人报复；有的妇女怕受家庭干涉，在高堤口支部不愿公开的二十四个党员中，就有十四个女党员有此顾虑。有的则是怕公开之后，就得在工作中带头会误工；有的怕公开后被选为干部。只有很少一部分是由于本身有错误或错误很大，觉悟又差，怕群众提意见，而以“公开整我就不干”来威胁区干部，抵抗整党。
    躺倒，曾是发生过的问题，如果现在不看具体环境与支部情况，不在支部内部进行一定的思想准备工作，草率地突然去公开整党，也的确会发生问题。但是，过去曾经发生过的躺倒现象，情况是复杂的，有的是由于不了解正确的整党方针；有的是犯有重大错误抵抗整党；有的是为躲避斗争入党，一宣布结束土改，他就不干了。对于这些情况不加分析，笼统地归咎于整党，以为一整党就会使党员躺倒，那是极端错误的。
    为什么会发生这些偏向？
    那么，为什么会发生这些偏向呢？这和一部分县区干部，对于整党成绩的否认是分不开的。一位县委同志对记者说：“整的时候左；复议的时候右，整党成绩没法说。”记者曾不止一次地看到这样的事情：有些县委区委同志，爱谈县区干部整党结束之初的故事。那时，有些被开除、留党察看、撤职的同志，到了一块便互问姓什么，对曰：“开”、“留”、“撤”。于是聚拢一团，互称“一家人”，哈哈大笑，以此表示对整党的不满。他们不去正确地估计整党成绩，有些同志则在肯定过去成绩时，只谈土改成绩，少谈甚至不提整党成绩。这是发生对下级无原则迁就的意识上的根源。干部如对整党没有正确认识，让他们领导整党是不会做好的。
    前一阶段濮县整党工作中的这些缺点，在冀鲁豫区的黄河以北地区，是程度不同地存在的。在六地委的茌平县，整党只是为了“蹬底”（叫党员了解政策，不打不拉）“叫起来”（恢复工作情绪）。在聊城、县委委员兼五区分书于振东，迁就张飞庄某些党员情绪，竟向他们保证不整党，八地委尚和（新县）有些干部的整党办法，是对村干“胡胡弄弄”，只要村干作工作就行。昆吾一部分干部，认为一提整党，干部就会躺倒。所以这问题有严重提出之必要。
