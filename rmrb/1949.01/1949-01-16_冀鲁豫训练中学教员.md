　　Training Middle School Teachers
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to implement the new policy of secondary education, the Jiluyu Administrative Office used the autumn break to hold a training class for middle school teachers. A total of 68 key teachers and staff from the five middle schools directly under the administrative office participated, studying for 20 days. At the beginning of the training, Minister Shen of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee reported on the current situation and the cultural and educational policies, and Deputy Director Wang conveyed the spirit of the North China Secondary Education Conference, which greatly inspired everyone. Through this study, everyone's confidence in engaging in education work has increased, and some vague concepts have been resolved. Such as the relationship between cultural education and political education, how to connect theory with practice, student collective mutual assistance and individual learning, etc., have all gained a more correct understanding. They felt that as long as they truly served the people, there would be a bright future. Everyone returned to their respective posts with the determination to implement the new policy and with great enthusiasm.

  　训练中学教员
    【本报讯】为贯彻中等教育新方针，冀鲁豫行署曾利用秋假空隙，举办中学教员训练班。参加者计有行署立的五个中学主要教职员共有六十八人，学习了二十天。训练开始，由区党委宣传部申部长报告目前形势及文教方针，王副处长传达华北中等教育会议精神，大家情绪振奋。经过这次学习，增加了各人对从事教育工作的信心，解决了若干模糊观念。如文化教育和政治教育的关系问题、理论和实际如何联系问题、学生集体互助和个人学习问题等等，都获得较正确的了解。感到只要真正为人民服务，就有光明前途，大家抱着贯彻新方针的决心，热情的回到各自的工作岗位。
