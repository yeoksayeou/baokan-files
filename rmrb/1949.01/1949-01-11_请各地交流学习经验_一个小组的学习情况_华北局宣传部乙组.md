Please Exchange Learning Experiences from Various Regions
　　A Study Group's Learning Situation
　　Group B, Propaganda Department, North China Bureau

　　After the study of the Four Major Documents concluded, to meet comrades' theoretical learning requirements, our group began studying the History of Social Development at the end of October. Now, we are presenting an introduction to this period of learning, for reference by various regions:
    (I)
    The method adopted at the beginning of the study was carried out in four steps: individual reading, raising questions, informal discussions (aimed at clarifying the issues), and discussions (to solve the issues). To facilitate the exchange of ideas, a study bulletin board was also established.
    At the beginning of the reading, some comrades thought they had read it before and were a bit "careless"; some comrades had the problem of "reading ten lines at a glance" and "not seeking a thorough understanding." Therefore, when reading the first time, everyone was generally cursory, almost "glancing over" and "skimming through," unable to raise any questions. Some even felt "I know it even without reading it" after reading it. However, when reading in detail the second time, the situation was different. Everyone felt that there were many places where "it looked like nothing at first glance, but you couldn't understand it when you looked closely." When they encountered other comrades raising questions, they felt unable to answer, and many questions were "knowing what it is, but not knowing why it is." This made everyone feel the need for in-depth study to gain a real understanding, and sparked enthusiasm for reading patiently word by word and sentence by sentence. Everyone has read the "Brief History of Social Development" twice in this period, and some as many as three times. Some comrades have gone on to consult "On the State," "Social Economic Formations," "From Ape to Man," and "Concise Textbook of Social Science," creating a habit of reading and raising some questions. Informal discussions began.
    In this period, the enemies encountered in learning, in addition to those mentioned above, were two more. One was "shame." Some comrades did not want to raise questions when they encountered problems they did not understand, feeling that "wouldn't it be embarrassing to raise such a simple question?" When raising questions, they always considered "Is this a question? Is it worth raising?" So they hid their doubts and incomprehension, unable to solve them quickly. The other was "pretense." When some comrades encountered other comrades raising questions, they did not really know, but always had to "pretend to know what they didn't know," and some even showed a slight disdainful look of "you don't even understand this." This also hindered the progress of learning.
    The shortcoming of this stage of learning was that it only emphasized self-study and lacked organization. Therefore, the questions raised were boundless and very unconcentrated. You raised yours, I raised mine, and it was impossible to conduct discussions. The people who raised questions became a little lax because they did not receive any response.
    (II)
    After the North China Bureau's decision on the education of on-the-job cadres was announced, the directly subordinate Learning Committee also announced a study plan. To study in depth, our group studied these two documents for three days and discussed them. Everyone's understanding of the importance of theoretical study was further advanced than before. Some comrades reviewed and said: In the past, I always thought that it was enough to study the current policies, why study the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin that seem to be far from the current situation? After studying the decision, I realized that the generation of policies is based on Marxist-Leninist theory and is the result of studying and analyzing the current reality. Without the foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory, it is impossible to truly understand the purpose and spirit of the policies, and it is even more difficult to correctly grasp and implement the policies. Chairman Mao's works are produced on the basis of Marxist-Leninist theory. Without a certain Marxist-Leninist theoretical foundation, it is also difficult to deeply understand Chairman Mao's thought. Some comrades reviewed: In the past, I was a bit narrow and one-sided, thinking that what I learned today should be used tomorrow, and if it couldn't be used, it was useless. Therefore, when studying the History of Social Development, I was interested in studying capitalist society and communist society, but I was unwilling to study the "From Ape to Man" and "Primitive Communist Society" at the beginning, thinking that it was a waste of time and energy. After studying the North China Bureau's decision, I realized that the law of social development is a complete development process from ancient times to the present and cannot be separated. If you don't study the beginning, it is difficult to understand the end. Of course, it is necessary to focus more on studying the latter part. Some comrades reviewed: In the past, I thought I had studied more theory, and I had read such profound theoretical books as "Anti-Dühring" and "Capital," so is it worth studying such simple theories as the "History of Social Development"? But after the initial reading and studying the decision, I was shocked to realize that my knowledge was very superficial and I couldn't answer why others asked questions. The theoretical foundation was still very poor, and I must lay the foundation again in the future. In short, everyone unanimously recognized that without a solid theoretical foundation, it is difficult to correctly understand all problems; if we cannot truly understand the law of social development, we will often be confused about the vigorous revolutionary movement to transform society, and we will not have a clear goal for the revolutionary cause for which we are willing to shed blood and sacrifice to win its victory. Therefore, everyone unanimously made up their minds to truly understand the law of social development in the study of the Brief History of Social Development.
    Due to this ideological awareness, everyone became humble and sincerely and earnestly reviewed the bad tendencies in the initial reading stage, such as "shame" and "pretense," and corrected their learning attitude. Based on the initial reading experience, the following study steps and methods for continued in-depth reading were determined:
    1. Read in sections, study comprehensively. - In reading in sections, we must understand the laws of the occurrence, development, and collapse of each society; in comprehensive research, we must clearly understand the basic laws of social development. In terms of time allocation: "From Ape to Man" - five days; "Primitive Communist Society" - one week; "Slave Society" - one week; "Feudal Society" - two weeks; "Capitalist Society" - two weeks; "Communist Society" - ten days. Then, a comprehensive review.
    2. When studying in sections, everyone focuses on studying one historical stage (i.e., one society), reading individually, raising questions and insights, preparing separately, and holding a discussion at the end of a section to clarify viewpoints and understanding. During the discussion, a comrade who has more materials or has insights on a certain issue should first make a main speech, and then everyone should supplement or refute it in connection with their own insights, and discuss it together, so as to avoid everyone not speaking or coming up with their own sets of ideas. Finally, the issues debated and clarified in the study are summarized. Before the discussion, all spare time is used for informal discussions to fully prepare.
    3. Encourage bold doubt and bold questioning. Ask "why" to truly understand; answering questions and speaking in discussions must be prepared and based on evidence. Oppose "thinking of course" and unfounded guesses.
    (III)
    After the meeting, the study entered a stage of intense in-depth reading. Everyone was immersed in reading books in the early morning, at night, and during work breaks.
    When studying primitive communist society, many questions were raised on the bulletin board and in informal discussions. On December 15, a discussion meeting was held based on the questions raised, and the following were discussed: "The boundary between clan and pre-clan society and the different characteristics of their production," "The sign of entering clan society from pre-clan society," "How the production methods of each period affect the marriage system," "The exact definitions of productive forces, relations of production, and modes of production." During the discussion, the questions gradually focused on "How did the private system arise? How did the primitive communist society collapse?" At this time, everyone felt that they could not solve the problem and could not clearly and completely say the reasons for the emergence of "private property." Continuing the discussion would inevitably lead to "unfounded speculation." Therefore, it was decided to further read the documents, and focusing on this issue, everyone consulted "Outline of Chinese History," "A Short History of China," "Concise Textbook of Social Science," and "Family, Private Property, and the Origin of the State" and other books to study the part on the emergence of private property in depth, and make brief notes as an outline for the next discussion speech.
    Due to more thorough preparation, the discussion meeting on December 20 relatively smoothly initially resolved the issue of the occurrence of private property and obtained a relatively clear concept.
    Everyone was very interested in learning at this stage, and their emotions were also high. Everyone felt that this kind of planned study, based on self-study and supplemented by organized discussions with preparation, yielded greater gains in learning, and the study gradually deepened. Whenever there was an opportunity, you could see two or three people discussing issues, and even during meals, some people were still talking about them, clarifying many issues that seemed right but were actually wrong in the past. Everyone has initially developed the habit of careful study, and it is estimated that after continuing in-depth study and future comprehensive research, many problems can be solved.

　　请各地交流学习经验
  　一个小组的学习情况
  　华北局宣传部乙组
    四大文件学习结束后，为了满足同志们理论学习要求，我们小组于十月底即开始了对社会发展史的学习，现将这一段学习情况，作一介绍，以供各地参考：
    （一）
    开始学习所采方法，是按自己阅读、提出问题、漫谈（目的是为了明确问题）、讨论（解决问题）四个步骤来进行，为了便于交流心得，并建立了学习墙报。
    起初阅读时，有些同志认为从前看过，有点“不在乎”；有些同志则有“一目十行”和“不求甚解”的毛病。因而在读第一遍时，一般都很粗略差不多是“走马看花”，“一滑即过”，提不出什么问题来。有的读过后，甚至还感觉“不看也知道”。但到第二遍详细阅读时，情形就不同了，大家都感到有很多地方是“粗看没啥，细看不懂”，偶然遇到旁的同志提出问题时，就感到无法回答，很多问题是“知其然，而不知其所以然”。这样才使大家感到有深入学习，求得真正领会的必要，掀起了逐字逐句耐心阅读的热情。对社会发展简史，大家在这一段时间里都读了两遍，多的达三遍。有些同志并进而参阅了“论国家”、“社会经济形态”、“从猿到人”、“社会科学简明教程”，造成了读书的习惯，并提出了一些问题。开始了漫谈。
    这一时期中所遇到的学习上的敌人，除上面所述外，尚有两个。一个是“羞”，有的同志遇到不懂的问题，不愿提出，觉得“这样简单的问题，提出去岂不丢人”，提问题时总考虑“这算不算个问题呢？值得提吗？”于是把疑问不懂之点藏起来，不能很快解决。另一个是“装”，有些同志遇到旁的同志提出问题时，本来不真知，但总要“强不知以为知”的来装一下，有的甚至还带出“你连这也不懂”的轻慢神色。因而也妨碍了学习的进展。
    这一段学习的缺点，是只强调自学，没有组织，因而问题提得漫无边际很不集中，你提你的，我提我的，无法进行讨论，提问题的人由于得不到回响，也就有点松懈了。
    （二）
    华北局关于在职干部教育决定公布后，直属学委又公布了学习计划。我们小组为了深入学习，将这两个文件学习了三天，并作了讨论，大家对理论学习的重要性，认识比以前进了一步。有的同志检讨说：过去总以为学学当前各项政策就行了，何必学那些与当前情况似乎离得较远的马恩列斯的著作呢？学了决定，才知道政策的产生乃是根据马列主义理论，被研究分析当前现实的结果，没有马列主义理论的基础，便不能真正领会政策的目的与精神，更不容易正确掌握与执行政策。毛主席的著作正是从马列主义理论基础上产生的，没有一定马列主义理论基础，也很难深刻的领会毛主席的思想。有的同志检讨：过去有些狭隘、片面，以为今天学了，明天就要用上，用不上就算无用。所以在学社会发展史时，觉得学资本主义社会，共产主义社会还有兴趣，而前面的“从猿到人”、“原始共产主义”就不愿学，认为那是白费时间，浪费精力，经过学习华北局决定后，才认识到社会发展规律从远古到现在是一个完整的发展过程，不能割开来学，不学前面的，也就很难学通后面的。当然对后面部分应更着重学，那是必要的。有的同志检讨出：过去以为自己学习理论较多，“反杜林论”、“资本论”这样高深的理论书籍我都看过，象“社会发展史”这样浅近的理论还值得我来学。但经过初读和学习决定后，才使我大吃一惊，原来自己所学“皮毛得很”，“吃不住别人问个为什么”，理论基础还差得很，今后必须从新打基础。总之，大家都一致认识到没有确切的理论基础，对一切问题的认识都很难正确；如果不能真正懂得社会发展的规律，对于轰轰烈烈的改造社会的革命运动，便会经常迷离不定，对于我们不惜流血牺牲以争取其胜利的革命事业，便会没有明确目标，因而大家一致下定决心，要在学习社会发展简史中真正懂得了社会发展的规律。
    由于这种思想上的自觉，使大家都虚心了，诚恳而认真的检讨了初读阶段中不良倾向，如“羞”和“装”，端正了学习态度。并根据初读经验，确定了继续精读的学习步骤和方法：
    一、分段阅读，综合研究。——在分段阅读中，要领会各个社会发生，发展与崩溃的规律；综合研究时，要做到对社会发展的基本规律了解清楚。时间分配上：“从猿到人”五天；“原始共产社会”一周；“奴隶社会”一周；“封建社会”两周；“资本主义社会”两周；“共产主义社会”十天。而后总复习。
    二、分段学习时，大家都集中学一个历史阶段（即一个社会），个人阅读，提出问题与心得，分别准备，到一段将结束时进行一次讨论，以明确观点与认识，讨论时由一位占有材料较多或某一问题有心得的同志先作主要发言，然后由大家联系自己心得补充或反驳，共同讨论，以免大家都不发言，或各来一套。最后则将学习中争论的和弄明确了的问题作一总结。在讨论以前并利用一切空余时间进行漫谈充分准备。
    三、提倡大胆怀疑，大胆发问，凡问题多问几个“为什么”以求得真正了解；解答问题，讨论发言，必须有准备，有根据，反对“想当然”和没有证据的猜测。
    （三）
    会后，学习进入了紧张的精读阶段，清晨、夜晚、工余之暇，大家均埋头于阅读书籍。
    学习原始共产社会，墙报上，漫谈中都提出不少问题，十二月十五日根据提出问题开了一次讨论会，讨论了“氏族与前氏族社会的分界及其生产的不同特点”“从前氏族社会进入氏族社会的标志”“各时期的生产方式如何影响到婚姻制度”，“生产力，生产关系，生产方式的确切定义”。讨论过程中问题逐渐集中到“私有制度怎样产生？原始共产社会如何崩溃”，这时大家感到还不能解决问题，不能清楚的完整的说出“私有财产”产生的原因来，再讨论下去势必产生“无根据地推想”。于是决定进一步阅读文件，并以这个问题为中心由大家分头参阅“中国史纲”，“中国通史简编”，“社会科学简明教程”“家族、私有制度和国家起源”等书，找有关私有财产产生的部分深入研究，并作扼要笔记以为下次讨论发言提纲。
    由于有了较充分的准备，十二月二十日开讨论会，比较顺利的初步解决了私有财产发生的问题，得到了比较明确的概念。
    这一阶段大家学习很有兴趣，情绪也高，大家觉得这种有计划的以自学为主而加以有准备的组织讨论，学习上收获较大，学习逐渐深入进去了。只要一有机会就可以看到三三两两漫谈问题，甚至吃饭中间还有人谈论，弄清了不少在过去之似是而非的问题。大家已初步有了仔细钻研的读书习惯，估计在继续深入学习与将来综合研究后，是可以解决很多问题的。
