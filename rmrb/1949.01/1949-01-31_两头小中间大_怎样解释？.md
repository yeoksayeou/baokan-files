Enquiry and Reply

　　How to explain "Small at Both Ends, Large in the Middle"?

Comrade Editor:
    Chairman Mao said that Chinese society is "small at both ends, large in the middle"; but he also said that poor and lower-middle peasants account for 50 to 70 percent of the rural population, while middle peasants only account for about 20 percent. Is this not a contradiction?

　　Jing Quan, Wang Ziheng

Comrades Jing Quan and Wang Ziheng:

    The so-called "small at both ends, large in the middle" refers to the quantitative comparison of various classes in Chinese society, and not to the peasant class alone. That is to say, in the quantitative comparison of various classes in Chinese society, the number of large landlords and large bourgeoisie (bureaucrat bourgeoisie) and the proletariat is very small; but the number of peasants and middle and petty bourgeoisie is very large. Therefore, the policies of the proletarian party must take into account the interests of the middle classes, and the peasants are especially the reliable allies of the proletariat.

### “两头小中间大”怎样解释？

专栏：询问与答复

　　“两头小中间大”怎样解释？编者同志：
    毛主席说中国社会是“两头小，中间大”；可是又说贫雇农占农村人口百分之五十到七十，中农只占百分之二十的样子，这是不是矛盾的？
　　景泉、王子亨景泉、王子亨同志：
    所谓“两头小，中间大”，是指中国社会各阶级的数量对比说的，并非指农民一个阶级说的。即是说，在中国社会各阶级的数量对比上，大地主大资产阶级（官僚资产阶级）和无产阶级人数都很少；但农民和中、小资产阶级的人数则很众多。因此无产阶级政党的政策必须照顾中间阶级的利益，农民尤其是无产阶级的可靠的同盟者。
