　　From a Village’s Perspective: Rural Youth Activities

Last year, before the land redistribution movement, a survey was conducted in Fangtaikou Village, First District, Fuping County, regarding the situation of youth. From this material, we can gain a general understanding of the daily life content and stylistic characteristics of rural youth, which is meaningful for studying the content of rural youth work. It is specially organized for your reference.

Fangtaikou is located on the north bank of the Shahe River and is a relatively prosperous village in the entire Fuping District, a long-established old liberated area. There are a total of ninety-eight young people in the village. Apart from those who have joined the army or are working elsewhere, there are still more than forty young people. According to the survey materials, we can see that the daily life activities of these young people are diverse and lively, representing some characteristics of rural youth life.

The youth in this village, first of all, like to learn new and fashionable things, and understand current affairs. During the Great Review campaign the year before last, every day was bustling. With the village's boiling activity, the young people were also very excited and active, showing great interest in participating in various meetings. No matter what meeting it was, the youth were the first to arrive and the most numerous. When asked why, they all answered in unison: "To understand current affairs." A twenty-four-year-old poor peasant youth, Li Kaitong, said: "As soon as I hear the drum, I can't concentrate on anything else. I put down my tools and rush to participate." Meetings seem to have a special attraction for them. Sometimes, they participate too much and are reprimanded by their families, who scold them: "Are you going there to eat or drink!" However, the young people always remain silent. Anyway, if they say there's a meeting, they have to go.

The youth in this village also have a very high enthusiasm for learning, but they lack fixed organization and leadership. Therefore, they all generally reflect: "We are always willing to learn, but no one manages us." On the one hand, they feel this lack, but at the same time, they automatically organize themselves to learn. It is quite common for several people to get together to learn to read in the village. A poor peasant youth named Chai Shusheng even collected some money to buy a small dictionary and constantly recited the phonetic symbols "勹攵冖匚万." In the village, a place called "Xiaobeigou" has many young people doing business, so they naturally gather together to learn to read, keep accounts, and calculate with an abacus. Since then, "Xiaobeigou" has also been called "Iron Abacus."

Naturally, although the combination of learning shows the young people's desire for knowledge, it is easy to fall into spontaneity due to a lack of organizational leadership. Their learning is mostly narrow, without a fixed direction or a definite plan. In the village, at the home of a fortune teller named Wu Xiazi (Five Blind), every night, people of all ages gather, with young people making up the majority, listening to this blind man tell stories of "Journey to the West" and thousands of years of ancient mythical and bizarre tales. The speaker gestures with his hands and feet, and the listeners are also fascinated, not dispersing until late at night. As soon as the young people finish dinner, they run there. Wind, rain, or snow cannot stop them. The young people all say, "It's addictive!" Thus, this talk of gods and ghosts is greatly welcomed in the village and has a certain adverse effect on the youth's thinking.

In addition, in this village, people generally regard young people as those who do not consider the consequences, are not afraid of anything, dare to speak and act, and are brave and upright. Landlords and bad elements fear them. If cadres make mistakes, they will immediately be criticized by this group of people. Being both full of a sense of justice and with increasing political awareness, the youth have become active members in various major struggles and mass movements in the past. During the anti-spy struggle in the past, they formed an anti-spy team, staying up half the night every day to investigate spies. During the Great Review campaign, most of the middle and poor peasants participated in this sharp struggle, and their actions were also very active. If we look at the depth of class consciousness, there are differences due to the different family backgrounds. Poor and hired youth have suffered from exploitation and oppression since childhood, so their class concepts are naturally clearer and their stance is firmer. For example, a poor peasant youth, Du Xiaohui, was once beaten severely by a landlord for pulling up a few weeds next to the landlord's garden and was falsely accused of being a thief. Therefore, the mention of landlords ignites the flames of hatred in his heart. As for the youth from landlord and rich peasant families, they generally adopt a negative attitude towards the struggle. Some even complain in front of others, saying that their family was wrongly struggled against. What about the middle peasant youth? Their class concepts are relatively vague. However, most of them actively participate in the actual struggle and even say things like: "Although my family has not been exploited, we must also help the poor peasants to turn over!"

After all, young people are different from the older and middle-aged. In addition to learning and work, the content of young people's lives, their usual entertainment and games, not only have many varieties and types, but also have seasonal and age divisions. Teenagers under the age of twenty have different preferences from those over the age of twenty. In winter, the weather is shorter, but there is more free time. You can always see them gathering in groups on the streets, making noises, playing games like "pulling soldiers," "standing on high mountains," and "making paper money." When spring comes, they go to temple fairs in groups or to watch operas in other villages. With the recent learning of "poker" and other games, their entertainment becomes even richer and more lively. As for those over the age of twenty, they are much more stable and like to sit down quietly with a few people to "chat idly," "talk nonsense," or "visit each other's homes."

In mass gatherings or meeting occasions, you can also see a group of young people fighting and making noise. Sometimes they make too much noise, and the cadres shout loudly: "This meeting can't be held. We must not allow this kind of fighting," but it still can't be stopped. The masses describe them well, saying: "This is a brood of black chickens and a brood of white chickens."

At the same time, they are very interested in participating in or organizing entertainment organizations such as theatrical troupes. For example, there was a time when they automatically organized themselves to learn to play the erhu. Now, in the village's theatrical troupe, apart from children accounting for half, young people account for more than three-fifths.

The most important thing in the daily life of rural youth is labor. Here, according to the materials, it seems that the youth in Fangtaikou Village do occupy an important position in production. "Many young people have almost become the main or sole laborers in their families." However, they have incorrect understandings of their attitude towards labor. Poor and hired youth families are poor, so they are naturally the most active in production. For example, Zhang Xiaogeng and Du Xiaoling, two poor peasant youth in the village, went out to herd sheep at the age of twelve or thirteen. When they grew older, they still went up the mountain to collect firewood every day. Middle peasant youth families are relatively well-off, so their main requirement is to "do what should be done, rest as much as possible, and go out to play and go to temple fairs when they are free." Therefore, their families are dissatisfied and sigh, saying: "They are not easy to discipline." Thus, conflicts and opposition often occur with their families. Most of them think that labor and production are just suffering and try to avoid labor as much as possible. Of course, they cannot realize that helping the family with production is not only beneficial to the family but also helps the social and economic construction. Even the young women in the village have the idea of "marrying cadres, enjoying a good life, and not working." Therefore, it is very urgent to lead young people to engage in production and correct their attitude towards labor.

By studying the various practical examples above, we can see several characteristics of rural youth life:

First, it is obvious that the level of awareness of peasant youth is gradually increasing today. Therefore, what is manifested in their actions is full of vigor, actively seeking progress, feeling keenly about foreign new things, and also learning automatically.

Second, in various struggles, in general, young people actively participate and have played a certain role.

Third, the content of young people's lives is also vigorous. There are many types of entertainment activities, and they are not monotonous and are interesting.

Production, learning, work, and entertainment constitute the main content of their daily lives, but a lack of leadership will cause youth activities to fall into spontaneity, and young people will not be able to make certain progress. At present, some people believe that youth work is too monotonous, has no content, and the future is not grand enough. However, this practical material inspires us that if youth work can grasp the characteristics of young people's daily activities, and then organize, lead, educate, and train young people correctly, it will be felt that the content of youth work is rich, vigorous, and has a grand future.

### 从一个村子里来看农村青年的活动

　　从一个村子里来看农村青年的活动
    去年，在平分运动以前，曾在阜平县第一区方太口村作过一次关于青年情况的调查，从这个材料里，对于农村青年日常生活内容、作风特点，可得到一些梗概的了解，做为研究农村青运内容的问题是有意义的。特整理出来，供大家参考。
    方太口位于沙河北岸，是阜平全区中比较富庶的村子，十几年的老解放区。全村青年共有九十八人，除了参军外出工作的以外，还有四十多个青年，根据调查材料，我们可看出这些青年的日常生活活动，是多样的，生动活泼的，代表着农村青年生活的一些特点。
    这个村里的青年，首先是喜欢学习新鲜的、时髦的东西，明白现在的事情。在前年大复查时，每天熙熙攘攘，随着村里的沸动，青年人也兴高采烈，活跃非常，对于参加各种会议，发生极大的兴趣，无论那一次开会，到得快的就是青年，到得最多的也是他们。问为什么这样？都异口同声的回答：“为了明白现在的事情”。一个二十四岁的贫农青年李开通说：“一听见打鼓就干什么也干不在心上了，放下家伙，就立刻跑去参加”。会议对他们好象有特别吸引力似的，有时候，参加得太多了，于是便遭到家庭的训斥，而会受到这样的责骂：“你去吃那呀！喝那呀！”然而青年们老不作声，反正说开会了，就非去不行。
    这村里，青年人的学习热忱也非常的高，只是缺乏固定的组织和领导，所以他们都普遍地有着这样反映：“学习总愿意学习，就是没人管”，一方面他们既然感到这种缺憾，但同时却自动起来组织学习了，几个人凑在一块识识字，在村里是相当普遍的现象，有一个贫农青年叫柴树生的，还集了一些钱，买了一本小字典，成天念着“勹攵冖匚万”注音字母。在村子里，一个叫“小北沟”的地方，因为年青做买卖的多，于是也便自然会集在一块儿学习识字记帐，打算盘，自此，“小北沟”也被人称为“铁算盘”。
    自然，学习的组合一方面虽说明了青年有求知的欲望，但因为缺乏组织领导，容易陷于自流，他们的学习，大半都是有狭隘性的，无固定方向，也无一定计划。村里有一个算卦的叫五瞎子的家里，每天晚上，便聚集了各样年纪的人，其中青年尤占大多数，听这位瞎子讲西游，讲千年古代神怪离奇的故事，言者手指脚画，听者亦津津有味，至夜深不散，青年们一吃完了晚饭，就往那里跑，刮风下雪，也阻止不住他们，青年都说“有瘾了！”于是这谈神说鬼的教育，在村中大大的受到欢迎，也在青年思想中发生了一定的不良作用。
    此外，在这个村里一般人都把青年看作为不顾前后，什么也不怕，敢说敢为，勇敢正直的人物。地主坏蛋畏惧他们，干部有错，立刻也会受到这一伙人的批评，既富有正义感，再因政治觉悟性日益提高，于是青年就成为历次各种大斗争中群众运动中的积极分子。在过去反特斗争时，他们组成了反特队，每天夜里，半宿不睡，去侦察特务。而大复查时，中贫农大半都参加了这个尖锐的斗争，行动表现也非常积极，假如由阶级觉悟程度之深浅来看：则因家庭成份之不同而有差异，贫雇青年，自幼便身受剥削压迫的痛苦，自然阶级观念比较明确，立场也较为坚定。如一个贫农青年杜小会，曾经因为拔了地主园旁几棵草，挨过地主一顿毒打，还被诬蔑为小偷，所以一提起地主，心里便燃起仇恨的火焰。至于地主富农青年一般的，对斗争都采取消极的态度，有的还在人前怨言喁喁，说错斗了他家。中农青年呢？阶级观念则比较模糊了。但是，他们大部还积极参加实际斗争，而且还说这样的话：“我家虽未被剥削，但也要帮助贫农翻身呀！”
    青年人毕竟不同于老壮年，青年人的生活内容，除开学习工作之外，他们平日的娱乐游戏，不但花样种类多，而且还有季节之分，年龄之分，二十岁以下的青少年，喜好就不同于二十岁以上的，冬天天气较短，但闲空却比较多，你总可以看到他们成群的在街头嚷闹，作什么“拉兵”“站高山”“当纸钱”等等游戏。春天到了，便结队去赶庙会或去外村看戏，加上新近又学会玩“普克”等等，于是他们娱乐更为丰富活泼。至于年过二十岁的，就稳重得多，爱几个人静下来“拍闲话”“胡道”或“串门子”了。
    在群众聚集或开会的场合中，也可看到一片、一伙的青年在打闹，有时候闹得太厉害，干部就大声嚷：“这会没法开，非不让这样打闹才行”，但是还是阻止不了。群众却把他们形容得好，都说：“这是黑鸡一窝白鸡一窝”。
    同时，他们对于参加或组织剧团之类的娱乐组织兴趣也非常高，比如过去曾经有一个时期，他们自动组织起来一块儿学拉胡琴，而现在村里的剧团团员之中，除去儿童占一半以外，青年人就占了五分之三还多。
    农村青年，日常生活最主要的是劳动。在这里，我们根据材料，看来在方太口村的青年的确在生产中也占有重要的位置，“许多青年差不多都变成家庭中主要劳动与唯一劳动者了。”但是在他们的对劳动的态度上却有着不正确的认识。贫雇青年家庭贫苦，生产自然最为积极，如村里的张小更、杜小岭两个贫农青年，十二三便出去为人牧羊，年岁长大了，每天还是上山捎柴，中农青年，家庭比较优裕，所以主要的要求是“该干什么就干什么，尽可能多休息，空闲时去玩耍，赶庙会。”因此使家庭不满而叹气说：“可不好管教了，”于是常常和家庭发生矛盾对立，他们大都是以为劳动生产，就是吃苦，尽量想不劳动，当然更不能认识到帮助家庭生产，不但对家庭有益而且也帮助了社会经济建设，甚至村里的青年妇女，思想存在有“嫁干部，享福气，不劳动”的思想。所以带头青年从事生产，纠正劳动态度，是非常迫切的。
    由上面各种实际例子来研究，就可以看到农村青年生活的几个特点：
    第一、显而易见的，农民青年在今天觉悟程度是逐渐提高了，因此表现在他们行动中的就是富有朝气，积极求进步，对外来新鲜事物感觉敏锐，同时也自动学习。
    第二，在各种斗争中，一般的，青年都积极参加，而发生了一定的作用。
    第三、青年生活内容，也是生气勃勃的。娱乐活动种类特多，而且不单调，有趣味。
    生产、学习、工作、娱乐构成了他们日常生活的主要内容，但缺乏领导则将使青年活动陷于自流，青年得不到一定的进步。目前，有些人认为青运工作太单调，无内容，前途是不够远大的，然而由这篇实际材料启示了我们：青运工作如果能抓住青年日常活动的特点，来加以正确的组织领导，教育训练青年，就会感觉到青运工作内容是丰富的，朝气蓬勃有着远大的前程。
