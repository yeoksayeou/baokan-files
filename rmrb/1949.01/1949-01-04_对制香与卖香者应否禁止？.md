Inquiries and Answers

　　Should the Production and Sale of Incense Be Prohibited?
　　Question: In some areas of Southern Hebei, incense paper and other superstitious items are still being manufactured. In Gaoyi, there are more than ten loads of incense for sale at every market. I interviewed a seller of incense, and he said, "This incense factory is a public investment." Therefore, I believe that the people's superstition can be addressed through scientific education. Public investment in the manufacture of superstitious items should be prohibited, but should private incense factories also be prohibited?
　　　　　　　　　　　Gaoyi Zhao Yushan, Guo Ouchi
　　Answer: The control of incense can be viewed in two ways. The raw materials for incense are made from cypress branches and leaves and other things. If they are made into mosquito coils, they can prevent mosquitoes from harming people, which is useful. However, if they are used exclusively for burning incense to worship "gods" and other superstitious purposes, then it is wrong.
　　In many areas now, especially in newly liberated areas, the masses still engage in superstitious activities such as burning incense and kowtowing. This is mainly because the people's political awareness is not high and they lack scientific knowledge. In the future, as long as we strengthen propaganda and education, the masses will become more aware, and naturally they will no longer burn incense. Therefore, we do not prohibit the sale or production of incense at present, but we do not encourage the production of incense either. Public institutions investing in the manufacture of incense paper and other superstitious items is following the masses' tails and should be corrected.

　　对制香与卖香者应否禁止？
    问：现在冀南有些地区还在制造香纸等迷信用品，高邑每集上就有十余担卖香的。我访问了一个卖香的，他说：“这制香厂是公家投资的买卖。”因此我认为老百姓迷信，可拿科学的道理宣传教育，公家投资制造迷信品应该禁止，可是对一般私营制香厂是否也应该禁止呢？
    　　　　　　　　　　　高邑赵玉山、郭藕池
    答：管制香可以分两种来看，香的原料是由柏树枝叶及其它东西制成的，如果造成蚊香，可以制止蚊虫害人，这就是有用的，如专供烧香敬“神”等迷信用，则是不对的。
    现在有不少地区，尤其新区群众，还存在着烧香磕头等迷信事情，这主要是老百姓政治觉悟不高，缺乏科学知识，今后只要我们加强宣传教育，群众觉悟高了，自然他们就不烧香了。因之我们目前不禁止卖香、制香，但也不奖励制香。公营机关投资制造香纸等迷信品，这是做了群众的尾巴，应该纠正。
