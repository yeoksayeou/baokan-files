　　Unfold Debate to Promote Literary Movement
　　Editor

　　On December 21st of last year, this newspaper published two articles about the impressions after reading "Good Overcomes Evil". Because these two works represented two completely different views on "Good Overcomes Evil", they greatly attracted the attention of readers. Subsequently, we successively received some manuscripts participating in this debate. Some of our colleagues in the newspaper who love literature and art also actively contributed to the wall newspaper to participate in the debate. We believe that this is a gratifying phenomenon in the literary and art circles. The focus of the debate is mainly on the practical guiding significance of the works, and thus involves the differences in understanding of basic issues such as rural class relations, rural parties, and the implementation of the Party's policies in rural areas in recent years. We believe that the development of this criticism movement is of great educational significance to the author, the critic, and the readers who care about this issue. Judging from the four articles published in this newspaper today and the two articles published on December 21st, there are roughly the following main differences in opinion:

　　First, what is the theme of "Good Overcomes Evil"? Who is the protagonist? Is the love story of Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao the theme? Or is the Party's policy since the implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction the theme? Are Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao the protagonists? Or is Wu Hai, the representative of the middle peasant Ju Cai and the executor of the policy, the protagonist? Starting from this point of divergence, two evaluations of the work have been produced: the former believes that there are many defects, at least it is not very perfect. For example, the depiction of Xiao Bao is considered not real enough, and the love between the two is also considered unreasonable, etc. Some even consider it "Marvelous Tales, Ancient and Modern"; while the latter considers it "an excellent work" with "great educational significance." Although there are shortcomings, it does not affect the perfect value of the work.

　　Second, it involves the class viewpoint of the work: one opinion believes that applying black ash to the face of the landlord's "leg," Xiao Dan, to replace the landlord's sins is a vague class viewpoint, and cited the Soviet Union's experience to illustrate the inappropriateness of this treatment. Another opinion believes that exposing less of the landlord's sins cannot be the main defect of this work, and this defect can be remedied by another work.

　　Third, it is about the understanding of rural parties; one opinion believes: "The decisive role played by the Party in various aspects of change in rural areas has been neglected," therefore, it is believed that "the Communist Party on paper is not the real Communist Party"; one opinion believes that the work reflects the actual situation of the rural party, and it is precisely because of this that the rectification of the party has its practical significance.

　　We believe that the above differences are all issues of principle. We hope that readers from all over will continue to participate in the debate. We believe that the development of this debate will play a positive guiding role in the literary and artistic movement in the liberated areas in the future. Let us all "start the machine," use our brains, and distinguish the truth from the debate. Everyone work hard and concentrate everyone's wisdom. We are fully likely to receive the expected results.

　　展开论争推动文艺运动
    编者
    去年十二月二十一日，本报曾发表了两篇关于“邪不压正”读后感的文章，由于这两篇作品是代表着对“邪不压正”的两种完全不同的看法，大大的引起了读者的注意，接着我们就陆续收到了一些参加这一论争的稿件，本报一些爱好文艺的工作同志，也都纷纷在壁报投稿参加争论，我们认为这是文艺界的一个可喜的现象。论争的重点，主要集中在作品的现实指导意义上，因而也就牵涉到对农村阶级关系、对农村党、对几年来党的政策在农村实施……一些基本问题的认职的分歧，我们认为这种批评运动的开展，无论对作者、对批评者、以及关心这一问题的读者，都是有着重大的教育意义的。从本报今日所发表的四篇及十二月二十一日发表的两篇争论中看，大体有以下几种主要的分歧意见：
    第一、“邪不压正”的主题是什么？主人翁是谁？软英和小宝的恋爱故事是主题呢？还是实行减租减息以来的党的政策是主题呢？主人翁是软英小宝呢？还是中农聚财及执行政策的代表人物兀孩呢？从这分歧点出发，便对作品产生了两种评价：前者认为缺陷很多，起码说是不十分完美的。如对于小宝的描绘觉得不够真实，两人的恋爱亦有不近情理之处等。甚至有人认为是“今古奇观”：而后者则认为是“极好的作品”，“教育意义极大”。虽然有缺点，但并不影响该作品的完美价值。
    第二、是涉及了作品的阶级观点问题：一种意见认为将地主的“腿”小旦，涂上满脸黑灰去顶替地主的罪恶是阶级观点的含糊，并引证了苏联的经验来说明这一处理的不恰当。另一种意见认为暴露地主罪恶较少不能成为这篇作品的主要缺陷，这个缺陷还可以用另一篇作品去补救。
    第三、是对农村党的了解问题；一种意见认为：“把党在农村各方面变革中所起的决定作用忽视了”，因此便认为“纸上的共产党不是现实的共产党”；一种意见认为作品中表现的是农村党的实际情况，也正因为如此整党才有它的现实意义。
    以上分歧，我们认为都是带有原则性的问题，希望各地读者继续参加争论，我们相信，这一论战的展开，对今后解放区的文艺运动，是会起积极的指导作用的。让我们大家都来“开动机器”，费费脑筋，从争论中去辨别真理，大家努力，把大家的智慧集中起来，我们是完全可能收到预期的效果的。
