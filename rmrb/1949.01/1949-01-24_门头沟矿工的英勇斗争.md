Xinhua News Agency, Pingjiao, 20th: The Mentougou miners, who have been engaged in a long-term struggle under the influence and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have now been liberated. Mentougou is the main supplier of daily coal for the people of the Pingjin area. On December 14th of last year, as soon as the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops fled from Mentougou, the miners swarmed out of the factories and coal mines. They first removed the explosives and landmines that the enemy had prepared to blow up the mine's machinery, and then gathered together to demand that the mine police disarm. They shouted, "The mine is our rice bowl, no destruction is allowed!" Under the miners' powerful influence and the pressure of the approaching People's Liberation Army, the mine's 145 policemen obediently handed over their weapons to the miners. Soon, the People's Liberation Army entered the mining area, and the workers immediately went to welcome them, joyfully shouting slogans such as "Long live the Communist Party!"

In the past dozen years, the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party led the Mentougou miners in armed struggles and strikes against the reactionary rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, many miners in Mentougou took up arms and formed the Mentougou Miners Guerrilla, attacking the Japanese invaders on the periphery of the mining area. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang occupied the Mentougou Coal Mine Company, and many miners joined the local People's Liberation Army guerrilla隊 due to their unbearable suffering under the Kuomintang's oppression. Several hundred people from the Mentougou Coal Mine Company alone joined the guerrilla隊. The workers who remained in the mine used strikes to oppose the oppression of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang. In 1943, the Japanese invaders only gave the miners one pound of corn flour a day, forcing them to eat bean cakes and bran, and many miners starved to death. The miners therefore went on strike and achieved some success. Later, under the Kuomintang's management, the treatment of the miners was also extremely harsh, and the miners' wages were only enough to buy one pound of corn flour a day. This time, the workers staged a 24-hour strike, and wages were increased. Last year, as the Kuomintang economy deteriorated sharply, the workers' lives also fell into an even more difficult situation. Between August and September, many workers could not afford grain and ate sweet potatoes to fill their stomachs. Many workers fainted in the mines during labor due to hunger. The workers had been brewing a strike, but the Kuomintang bribed traitors who stole the workers' strike funds and sabotaged the strike. At the same time, in order to suppress the Mentougou miners' struggle for survival, the Kuomintang stationed troops in the mining area, as well as more than thirty large and small police stations and secret service agencies. Since 1946, five Communist Party members have been arrested by the Kuomintang for leading the workers' struggle for survival. They were beaten, soaked in stinky pits, tied to electric poles, interrogated by a dozen courts, and imprisoned for two years, but they did not give in. One of them was cruelly buried alive by the Kuomintang.

On December 15, 1948, the long-suffering life of the Mentougou workers came to an end, and the People's Liberation Army brought a new era of light to the workers.

　　门头沟矿工的英勇斗争
    【新华社平郊二十日电】在中国共产党的影响与领导下进行过长期斗争的门头沟矿工，现在已得到了解放。门头沟是平津地区人民日用煤炭的主要供应地。去年十二月十四日蒋傅匪军刚从门头沟逃跑，矿工们立刻从厂房和煤窑中蜂拥而出。他们首先搬开了敌人准备爆炸矿厂机器的炸药与地雷，并集合起来，要求矿警解除武装。他们高呼着：“矿场是我们的饭碗，一律不准破坏！”该矿一百四十五名矿警，在工人的声威与解放军逼近的压力下，顺从地将武装交给了矿工。不久，解放军进入矿区，工人们立即前往欢迎。狂欢地叫喊着口号：“共产党万岁！”
    近十几年来，中国共产党的地下组织领导着门头沟矿工，为反对日寇及国民党的反动统治，曾进行了武装和罢工等等的斗争。抗日战争开始后，门头沟的许多矿工拿起武器，成立了门头沟矿工游击队，在矿区外围袭击日本侵略者。日寇投降，国民党占领了门头沟煤矿公司，也有很多矿工因不堪国民党的苛虐而参加了当地的解放军游击队。仅门头沟煤矿公司参加游击队的就有数百人。留在矿内的工人，则以罢工来反对日寇和国民党的压迫。一九四三年，日寇每天只给矿工一斤玉蜀黍面，逼得工人吃豆饼、吃糠，许多工人饿死了。矿工们因此进行罢工，获得了部分胜利。以后，在国民党管理下，对矿工待遇也极为刻薄，矿工的工资每天亦只够买一斤玉蜀黍面。这次工人又进行了二十四小时罢工，工资乃得到增加。去年国民党经济急剧恶化，工人生活也随着更陷入难堪的境地。八九月间，许多工人买不起粮食吃，以红薯充饥。许多工人在劳动中饿倒在矿坑里。工人们曾酝酿罢工，但国民党收买工贼偷去了工人的罢工经费，破坏了罢工。同时为了镇压门头沟矿工的求生斗争，国民党在矿区驻扎了军队以及大小三十多个警察所与特务机关。自一九四六年以来，有五名共产党员在领导工人的求生斗争中被国民党逮捕。他们被毒打，被泡在臭水坑里，被捆在电杆上，被十几个法庭审讯，被监禁二年之久，但他们没有屈服。其中有一位被国民党惨酷地活埋了。
    一九四八年十二月十五日，门头沟工人长期所受的辛酸痛苦生活告终，人民解放军给工人们带来了新的光明时代。
