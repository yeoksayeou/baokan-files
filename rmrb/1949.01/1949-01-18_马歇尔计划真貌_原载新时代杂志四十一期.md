The True Face of the Marshall Plan

　　I. Exporting Crisis and Unemployment

　　Today, as the political awareness of the masses grows rapidly, even the most violent imperialists must carefully disguise their aims and schemes. It was not without reason that Hitler donned the cloak of "National Socialism." Munich was a grand masquerade ball, where the warmongering powers of the West strutted about as saviors of European peace. The Marshall Plan, which enslaved the war-weakened European countries, is the last egg of the same nest. Wall Street diplomacy considers it should be called the "European Recovery Program."

　　But rude experience quickly exposed this trick. American commercial interest groups personally dealt a devastating blow to the story of American selflessness in aiding Europe, tearing apart the diplomats' flowery rhetoric with reckless explanations.

　　American monopoly capitalists are trembling because they are increasingly feeling the approach of an economic crisis. They want another injection of optimistic medicine. Therefore, Wall Street newspapers annotated the Marshall Plan, its seriousness perhaps truly surprising. It wiped away the State Department's words of benevolence and detailed the beneficial effects of the European Recovery Program on the American economy itself. This brought everything back to its original meaning, revealing the true face of the Marshall Plan—a scheme to restore the balance of the tottering American economy.

　　New York's "Citibank" wrote in its July bulletin: "In June, commercial conditions continued to rise. Although employers are pursuing conservative policies, especially on general commodities, it is generally believed that autumn trade and industrial and commercial activity are reliable… and the entire mechanism is supported by the European Recovery Program (i.e., the Marshall Plan - translator) and the anticipated greater military spending."

　　What is most significant here is the recognition that this inflationary "mechanism" in the United States is supported by the Marshall Plan and the incredibly arrogant hope of new, frantic military buildup.

　　American monopoly capitalists are so confident that the Marshall Plan is the way to escape their economic disorder that they take their wishes for reality. Their optimism is based on the assumption that the Marshall Plan will lead to a gradual increase in American exports. But this assumption is unfounded. In fact, despite the Marshall Plan, American exports are constantly shrinking.

　　When Marshall Plan aid began, American exports had already fallen from $1.53 billion in May 1947 to $1.141 billion in March 1948. And from that time on, it continued to decline, successively falling to $1.123 billion, $1.103 billion, $1.013 billion, and $1.002 billion in the four months of April, May, June, and July this year (1948). If the amount of price increases is added, the reduction in American exports is even more considerable. The total exports in the first seven months of 1948 decreased by more than 14 percent in value and more than 20 percent in quantity compared with the same period last year.

　　It is significant that even the delivery of goods under the Marshall Plan could not prevent the reduction in American exports to Europe. It decreased from $565.2 million in May 1947 to $409.2 million in March this year (1948), and in the four months of April, May, June, and July (the first four months of the Marshall Plan's implementation), it successively decreased to $374.44 million, $344.1 million, $335.7 million, and $333.5 million. This continued reduction is an inevitable result of the nature of the expansion of American foreign trade after the war. The basic principle of this foreign trade is: export as much as possible and import as little as possible. This policy of American monopoly capitalists has created a gold dollar deficit in the balance of payments of the countries that trade with them, greatly hindering the increase in their own exports.

　　Simultaneous with the gradual reduction of the United States' over-inflated post-war export trade, the domestic market in the United States is also contracting. Despite the newspapers' forced optimism, the domestic economic situation is deteriorating. This is reflected in the frantic inflation, the abnormal increase in monopoly profits, and the sharp decline in the real income of the entire nation. Even many of those American optimists who conduct statistical surveys do not believe in their hearts that the Marshall Plan can prevent the arrival of an economic collapse. At best, they hope that this plan can delay the collapse somewhat. Therefore, American monopoly capitalists are rushing to use the Marshall Plan to ruthlessly destroy their competitors and stifle the industry and trade of Western Europe. Therefore, the "European Recovery Program" can be more accurately called a plan to export crisis and unemployment to Western Europe.

　　II. Colonial Trade with Western Europe

　　It has been five months since the first batch of food and other goods delivery permits were issued under the Marshall Plan. During this period, the nature of American supplies has clearly revealed the determination of Wall Street monopoly capitalists to maintain the inflated export trade to Western Europe at all costs. Therefore, their ridiculous efforts are to prevent the Marshall Plan countries from re-equipping their industries and hindering the increase in their agricultural production. At the same time, the policy of deliberately continuing to make Western European countries short of dollars aims to tie them more firmly to the chariot of American expansion and make them the pawns of the war traffickers across the Atlantic.

　　From the beginning of the Marshall Plan's implementation until September 8, 1948, a total of $1.4465 billion in food and other goods delivery permits were issued. What did Europe get from this first $1.5 billion allocation from the United States? It is enough to simply state that industrial machinery accounted for only $48.1 million of the total deliveries, and agricultural machinery was even smaller—$1.9 million. Only one-thousandth of the Marshall Plan's deliveries were used to help the recovery of Western European agriculture, and three percent were used to solve the urgent needs of Western European industry.

　　An economic report published by the United Nations Economic Department in August this year (1948) stated: "In war-torn countries, the decline in tractive power during the war was so great that the 23,000 tractors and 260,000 livestock supplied by the Relief Administration are estimated to only make up for about five percent of these countries' losses at most."

　　The impudent and small amount of agricultural machinery assistance in the early stages of the Marshall Plan shows that the United States is determined to prolong the agricultural recovery of Western Europe with all its strength.

　　As for European industry, not only is it being refused equipment, but it is even being refused the important raw materials necessary for its recovery, especially steel. As of September 8, the approval for the export of $19.2 million of cast iron and $8.4 million of rolled steel to Europe together only accounted for 20 percent of the total aid. On the other hand, the American tobacco, fruit juice, egg powder, etc., exported by the Marshall Plan during the above period reached $139.2 million, almost three times the total value of industrial and agricultural aid.

　　In the past, new countries were colonized with small beads and equally cheap toys; today, the colonization of Western Europe is carried out with Kraft cheese, Camel cigarettes, and egg powder, which the United States is forcing Europeans to accept. Coincidentally, the proportion of machinery in the imports of colonial countries is even greater than in the American aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan. Before the war, machinery and other equipment accounted for 15 percent of India's imports.

　　But the executors of the Marshall Plan not only refuse to supply Western Europe with the goods it needs most, especially the means of production; at the behest of American monopoly capitalists, the Hofmann implementation agency (Economic Cooperation Administration - translator) is using all its strength to prevent the Marshallized countries from purchasing these goods from elsewhere. Oil is one example.

　　Western European countries have already been forced to drastically reduce their oil consumption. However, the United States has announced that it is not only prepared to strictly control the export of American oil to the Marshall Plan countries, but also to strictly control these countries' oil imports from other sources. "Oil and Gas Journal" declared on June 10: If these countries want to get American oil, they will have to notify the Hofmann office. They intend to import what kind of oil from elsewhere; and the Economic Cooperation Administration reserves the right to decide whether this import is appropriate. The Americans are actually threatening those Marshallized countries that receive very little oil ration under the "aid" plan, saying: The Americans will not allow them to purchase oil from non-dollar areas to make up for their fuel shortage.

　　Thus, we see that the Marshall Plan, which is said to aid Europe, actually hinders the normal supply of Western European countries' major necessities—not only supplies from the United States, but also supplies from other parts of the world.

　　III. Seizing Raw Material Resources

　　American expansionists not only want to monopolize oil. They are working to seize all rare raw materials to a greater or lesser extent—sacrificing Western European industry to strengthen American industrial power. Amidst shouts of increasing major strategic reserves, Wall Street regularly plunders the raw material resources of Western European countries, especially the British Empire.

　　At the end of August, the National Association of Manufacturers of the United States and the U.S. Munitions Board issued a strategic reserve list, which they believe must be stockpiled to protect "national security." The list includes nickel, tin, tungsten, lead, copper, manganese, zinc and other metals, rubber, castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil, shellac, fiber, mica, asbestos, bauxite, emery, industrial diamonds, graphite, talc, and even pepper. This rich menu of gluttonous American monopoly capitalists can be simply combined into one dish—the whole world.

　　As a reward for tobacco and egg powder, the Marshall Plan Administration requires Western European countries to pay all kinds of industrial raw materials—resources that American monopoly capitalists have long coveted. In fact, this is equivalent to dismantling Western European industry and seizing its raw material sources and reserves, in order to more confidently drive it out of the world market. American monopoly capitalists are seizing control of Western Europe's raw material resources, hoping to completely plunder the important industries on which it depends for independence.

　　For example, Swedish newspapers declared that the United States has actually taken control of Sweden's mines, buildings, timber, and other resources. Strangely enough, Sweden has pledged to supply the United States with raw materials under the Marshall Plan—not only when there is a shortage in the American market, but even when such a shortage is particularly foreseeable. This is equivalent to American capital being able to hoard raw materials at will at the expense of Sweden. What a cunning trick to prevent Swedish goods from competing with American goods!

　　American monopoly capitalists are showing a particular eagerness to seize the raw material resources of Western European countries, especially the colonies of the British Empire. For example, the United States' tin consumption this year will exceed 90,000 tons. About half of this is supplied by the state-run factory in Texas, which almost only melts Bolivian tin. But Bolivia only exports 35,000 tons of tin annually. On the other hand, the tin production of British Malaya exceeded 86,000 tons in 1940. American monopoly capitalists are now demanding free access to Malaya's tin reserves under the Marshall Plan. Moreover, the United States is attempting to buy raw tin on the spot instead of smelted tin, which will take away a large portion of the profits of British companies. American capital is also greedily eyeing the British Empire's copper mines. The United States' copper consumption this year (1948) will exceed 1.065 million tons, and Rhodesia (British territory in Southeast corner of Belgian Congo - translator) will produce 200,900 tons of copper this year. The Americans are now demanding expanded and broader opportunities to exploit Rhodesian copper mines.

　　With the help of the Marshall Plan, American capital is penetrating deep into the colonies of Western European countries, seizing important economic and political positions, and engaging in a struggle with the old masters. The Middle East is a powerful proof. American monopoly capitalists have just gained a foothold in the oil-rich Arab countries, and their diplomatic and military missions are conducting intense conspiracies aimed at driving Britain out of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. As Lord Lang recently pointed out in the "City Observer," Great Britain has increasing reason to fear that the oil in the Middle East may become an American patent, and that one day Britain will have to buy it with dollars.

　　马歇尔计划真貌
  　原载新时代杂志四十一期
    Ｕ·卡什卡洛夫  黄炳辉译
    一、输出危机与失业
    现代，当群众的政治觉悟急遽增长时，甚至最狂暴的帝国主义者也不得不仔细掩饰其目的与图谋。希特勒之披上“国家社会主义”罩袍，非为无因。慕尼黑是个庞大的假面具跳舞会，西方好战列强在这儿以欧洲和平的救主底面目出现，昂然阔步。奴役被战争削弱了的欧洲赌国的马歇尔计划，是同一窝里最后下来的蛋。金元外交认为应命之为“欧洲复员计划”。
    但无礼的经验很快便揭穿了这个诡计。美国商业利得集团却亲自予美国援欧底大公无私的故事以毁灭性打击，以莽撞的解释撕碎了外交家的花言巧语。
    美国独占资本家正因日益感到经济危机之迫近而发抖。他们要再打一针乐观主义药剂。因此华尔街的报章便给马歇尔计划下个注解，它的认真也许的确使人吃惊。它抹掉国务院的博爱言词，详述欧洲复员计划在美国自身经济上的有利作用。这使得一切归入原意，马歇尔计划原形毕露——一个企图恢复摇摇欲坠的美国经济平衡的图谋。
    纽约“花旗银行”在七月份的公报上写道：“在六月里，商业行情继续上升。虽然顾主正追随着保守政策，特别是在一般的商品上，但一般都认为秋季的贸易与工商业活动是靠得住的……而整个机构是由欧洲复原计划（即马歇尔计划——译者）和预期更大的军费支持着”。
    在这里最有意义的，乃是承认美国的这通货膨胀“机构”已由马歇尔计划和新的疯狂建军的希望支持着的无比狂妄。
    美国独占资本家如此地相信马歇尔计划乃是逃脱其经济紊乱的道路，因此他们都把愿望当真的看。他们的乐观乃基于马歇尔计划将导向美国输出渐增的假设上。但这个假设是没有根据的。事实上，虽有马歇尔计划，美国的出口正不断地减缩着。
    当马歇尔计划援助开始时，美国的出口已从一九四七年五月的十五亿三百万元跌到四八年三月的十一亿四千一百万元。并且从那个时候开始，继续下跌，今（一九四八）年四、五、六、七四个月里相继跌到十一亿二千三百万元，十一亿三百万元、十亿零一千三百万元和十亿零二千二百万元。假如加上物价的上涨数额，则美国的出口减缩更为可观。在四八年的头七个月里的输出总额，比起去年同期在价值上减低了百分之十四以上，在数量上减低了百分之二十以上。
    有意义的，就是甚至连马歇尔计划的交货亦不能阻止美国对欧洲输出的减缩。它从一九四七年五月的五亿六千五百二十万元减至今（一九四八）年三月的四亿九百二十万元，而在四、五、六、七四个月（马歇尔计划实现的头四个月）里，却相继减少到三亿七千四百四十万元，三亿四千四百一十万元、三亿三千五百七十万元和三亿三千三百五十万元。这种继续的减缩乃是美国战后对外贸易的扩张性质的必然结果。这个对外贸易的基本原则是：尽量多输出和尽量少输入。美国独占资本家的此一政策，造成了和他们贸易的国家在收支平衡上的金元亏空，大大妨碍了其本国出口的增加。
    与美国的过度膨胀的战后出口贸易逐步减缩同时，美国的国内市场亦同样在收缩着。尽管报章在强作乐观，国内的经济形势正在每况愈下。这反映在狂乱的通货膨胀景象、独占利润的反常增殖和国民整个真正收入的暴跌中。甚至许多那些作统计调查的美国乐观者，在他们底深心里也不相信马歇尔计划能够阻止经济崩溃的到来。顶多，他们希望靠了这个计划能把崩溃稍为拖后一些。因此美国独占资本家乃急忙利用马歇尔计划来无情地摧毁他们的竞争者，窒息西欧的工业与贸易。因此，“欧洲复员计划”是能够更正确地称为向西欧输出危机与失业的计划。
    二、与西欧的殖民地贸易
    自从马歇尔计划颁发首批的粮食和其他物品交货许可以来，倏忽已过去了五个月。在这个时期中，美国供应的性质已明确地透露出华尔街独占资本家不惜一切以维持对西欧的膨胀出口贸易底决心。因此他们可笑的努力乃是阻止各马歇尔计划国家重新装备其工业，阻碍她们的农业增产。同时，存心继续使西欧国家美元短绌的政策，目的是把她们更牢靠地缚在美国扩张的战车上，使她们成为大西洋彼岸的战贩们的走卒。
    从马歇尔计划开始实行到四八年九月八日为止，共颁发十四亿四千六百五十万元的粮食和其他商品交货的许可。欧洲从美国的这笔首次十五亿元拨款中得到些什么？仅仅说出这点便够了，工业机器仅占总交货的四千八百一十万元，而农业机器更小得可笑——一百九十万元。马歇尔计划的交货中，只有千分之一是用来帮助西欧农业复原，百分之三用来解决西欧工业的急需。
    联合国经济部今（一九四八）年八月里发表的经济报告称：“在战祸国家，曳引力在战时的衰减如此巨大，以致救济总署所供给的二万三千辆拖拉机和二十六万头牲口，估计顶多只能填补上这些国家的损失的百分之五”。
    马歇尔计划初期的无礼的小量农业机器援助，表明美国决心全力拖长西欧的农业复原。
    至于对欧洲的工业，不但拒绝予以装备，甚而拒绝供给其复原所必需的重要原料，特别是钢铁。到九月八日为止，批准向欧洲输出一千九百二十万元的铸铁和八百四十万元的辗延钢，合起来才占总的援助的百分之二十。另一方面，马歇尔计划在上述期间内输出的美国烟草、果汁、鸡蛋粉等等却达一万万三千九百二十万元，几乎是工业、农业援助总价值的三倍。
    在从前，新的国家是靠了小珠串和同样廉贱的玩具而被殖民地化；今天西欧的殖民地化却是靠了吉士牌、骆驼牌香烟和鸡蛋粉，这些东西是美国强迫欧洲人接受的。凑巧的，机器在殖民地国家的输入中的比例，甚至比在美国在马歇尔计划下对欧洲的援助中来得大。战前印度的输入中，机器和其他装备占百分之十五。
    但是马歇尔计划执行者不仅是拒绝供给西欧所最急需的商品，特别是生产手段；听命于美国独占资本家，霍夫曼的执行机构（经合总署——译者）正以全力阻止各马歇尔化的国家从他处购得这些货物。石油即其一也。
    西欧国家早已被迫大量节减其石油消耗量。然而美国又宣布了她不只准备严格管制美国石油对马歇尔计划国家的输出，并且还要严格管制这些国家从其他方面来的石油进口。“石油和煤气杂志”在六月十日宣称：假若这些国家想得到美国石油，她们将必须通知霍夫曼办公室。她们打算从旁处输入什么样的石油；而经合总署保留其决定这种进口是否适当的权利。美国人实际上是威胁那些在“援助”计划下收到很少的石油配给量的马歇尔化的国家说：美国人将不允许她们从非美元区购入石油以补救其燃料之不足。
    这样我们看到，说是援助欧洲的马歇尔计划，实际上妨碍了西欧各国主要必需品的正常供应——不仅是美国来的供应，还包括世界其他地方来的供应。
    三、攫取原料资源
    美国扩张主义者不仅只要独揽石油。他们正致力或多或少地攫取所有的稀罕原料——牺牲西欧工业以加强美国工业力量。在高呼增加主要战略积存声中，华尔街经常掠劫西欧各国，特别是大英帝国的原料资源。
    在八月底，美国全国制造家协会和美国军需局发表一张战略积存单，他们认为单上物资必须积存起来，以保护“国家的安全”。名单上包括镍、锡、钨、铅、铜、锰、锌及其他金属，橡皮、蓖麻子油、椰油、橄榄油、虫胶、纤维、云母、石棉、铁矾土、金钢砂、工业金钢钻，石墨、滑石、甚至还有胡椒。饕餮的美国独占资本家的这一份丰富的菜单，能够简单地并成一道菜——全世界。
    作为烟草与鸡蛋粉的报酬，马歇尔计划总署要求各西欧国家缴纳各种工业原料——美国独占资本家垂涎多时的攫取资源。事实上这等于解除西欧的工业，夺取它的原料来源与积存，以更有把握将其逐出世界市场。美国独占资本家正攫取对西欧的原料资源的控制，希望彻底抢光其赖以独立的重要工业。
    例如，瑞典报章宣称，美国实际上掌握了瑞典的矿藏、建筑、木材和其他资源。十分奇怪，瑞典按照马歇尔计划誓言以原料供给美国——不仅是在美国市场缺货时，甚至是在这种缺货尤属预见之时。这等于美国资本能够牺牲瑞典而随意囤积原料。好一个防止瑞典商品与美货竞争的狡计！
    美国独占资本家正表现出特别急于攫取西欧国家，特别是大英帝国的殖民地的原料资源。例如美国今年的锡消耗量将超过九万吨。其中约有一半系由德克萨斯州官办工厂供给，该工厂几乎只溶＠波利维亚锡。但波利维亚每年仅输出三万五千吨的锡。他方面，英属马来亚的锡产在一九四○年却逾八万六千吨。美国独占资本家现在根据马歇尔计划，正要求自由取得马来亚的锡藏。更甚者，美国企图就地收买原锡而不是＠锡，这将夺取英国公司的一大部分利润。美国资本亦贪婪地盯着大英帝国的铜矿。今（一九四八）年美国的铜消耗量将逾一百零六万五千吨，罗得西亚（南非英国属地在比属刚果东南角——译者）今年将产铜二十万零九千吨。美国人现在正要求扩大开采罗得西亚铜矿的更广泛的机会。
    借助于马歇尔计划，美国资本正深入到西欧国家的殖民地去，攫取重要的经济和政治地位，和旧主人展开斗争。中东便是一个有力的证明。美国独占资本家才在石油藏量丰富的阿拉伯国家取得立足点，他们的外交、军事使团便进行紧张的阴谋，旨在把英国逐出伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯和伊朗。正如朗格勋爵最近在“城观察家”上所指出，大不列颠日益有理由害怕中东的石油可能成为美国的专利，而终有一日英国将要用美元去买。
