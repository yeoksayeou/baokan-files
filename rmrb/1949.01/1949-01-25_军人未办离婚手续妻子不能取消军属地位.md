Wife of a Serviceman Cannot Have Military Dependent Status Revoked if Divorce Procedures are Not Completed
    Question: I have two things I am unclear about regarding marriage issues:
    1. After a man enlists in the army, his wife and five-year-old daughter remain at home. The man proposes divorce, but the woman disagrees. In this case, if the man, without government intervention, refuses to acknowledge his original wife, can the woman's military dependent status be revoked?
    2. A couple's marriage was arranged by their parents. They have been married for six or seven years, and the relationship has always been strained. Now the man proposes divorce, and the woman is also very eager to escape her misery and pursue her own future. However, because the woman is feudal and shy, she is unwilling to speak out publicly. Is it possible to enlighten her or provide explanation and education?
   "Qinghai Department" Yan Zhongrong

    Answer: (1) Before the government rules on a divorce, the man cannot revoke the woman's military dependent status. If divorce procedures are completed and the woman has the right to remarry, she can no longer be considered a military dependent. However, if the woman and her children are without fault and are experiencing financial difficulties, the man should be responsible for their support and education.
    (2) "The man requests a divorce, and the woman is also very eager to escape her misery and pursue her own future," but solely because she is "feudal and shy, unwilling to speak out publicly," one can find ways to help her understand that marriage between men and women should be based on mutual love, and that shyness is a feudal idea that should be discarded, so that she has the courage to voluntarily complete the divorce procedures.

    Editor:
    The unreasonable marriage system of arranged marriages and monetary transactions widely practiced in the old society involved parents betrothing their children at a very young age. At the time of betrothal, the woman's parents demanded a substantial "bride price" (money, grain, cloth, etc.) from the man's family. After liberation, educated by the democratic government and with increased awareness, women have risen up to oppose this and fight for freedom of marriage, petitioning the government for divorce (and of course, some men also request it). However, men who do not want a divorce emphasize: "Her parents spent our money when we got engaged...If they return it, I will divorce, otherwise I cannot divorce." In this way, women from wealthy families can get divorced, while women from poor families who cannot repay the money cannot divorce, which affects women's liberation. However, if the bride price is not returned, the man loses both his money and the woman, which is also inappropriate. How should this problem be resolved? Please provide a specific and detailed answer as soon as possible.
    Shijiazhuang People's Court Xiao Pei

    Comrade Xiao Pei of the Shijiazhuang People's Court:
    Marriage by purchase is fundamentally illegal, and it is a remnant of the old society that should be stopped. Therefore, in dealing with this issue, the "bride price" cannot be treated as a condition for divorce. If there are indeed grounds for divorce, mediation should be used, and a decision on whether to refund in full, refund more, refund less, or not refund at all should be based on the economic situation of both families. A divorce judgment should not be withheld simply because the woman is poor and cannot come up with the money, thereby affecting the liberation of women.

### 军人未办离婚手续妻子不能取消军属地位

　　军人未办离婚手续妻子不能取消军属地位
    问：我对婚姻问题上有两点弄不清：
    一、有某男的参军后，其妻及五岁幼女在家，男方提出离婚，女方不同意，这时男方未经政府处理，就不承认其原来之妻，女方是否可以取消其军属地位？
    二、夫妇都是由家长包办结婚的，从结婚到现在共六七年了，双方一贯不和，现在男方提出离婚，女方亦极愿脱离苦海，各奔前程、但因女方封建害羞，不肯公开吐字，这时是否可以启发她？或给以解释教育？
  　“青海部”  岩中溶
    答：（一）男方参军在未经政府判决离婚以前，不能取消女方的军属地位，如办理离婚手续之后，女方已有另行结婚之权，即不能成为军属了。但若女方及其子女并无过失而生活陷于困难时，男方应负赡养与教育的责任。
    （二）“男方要求离婚，女方亦极愿脱离苦海，各奔前程”，而单单因为“封建害羞，不肯公开吐字”，可以设法帮助她了解男女婚姻应基于互爱，害羞是封建思想，应该破除，使她有勇气自愿地办理离婚手续。
    　（华北人民政府司法部）编辑同志：
    旧社会普遍实行的家长包办及金钱买卖等不合理的婚姻制度，其家长在自己的儿女很小的时候即给他们早早的订了婚，在订婚时女方的家长又要了男方很厚的“彩礼”（钱，粮，布等），解放以后得到民主政府的教育，觉悟提高，女方便起来反对，争取婚姻自由，到政府请求离婚（当然也有男方提出的），而男方不愿离者即强调：“她家父母在订婚时使过我们的钱………若归还我即离，不然即不能离。”这样女方家富者固可离了婚，而家贫还不了钱者即不能离，妇女解放便受到了影响；可是如不退还彩礼，男方人财两空，亦有不妥。这个问题应如何解决，请速予以具体详细答复。
    石家庄市人民法院　萧佩
    石家庄人民法院萧佩同志：
    买卖婚姻根本不合法，这是旧社会遗留下来的余毒，应设法制止。因此在处理这种问题时，不能把“彩礼”当做离婚与否的条件；如确有离婚条件时，应用调解办法，根据双方家庭经济状况，决定全退、多退、少退、或不退。不应因女方穷拿不出钱来，就不予判决离婚，而影响到妇女的解放。
