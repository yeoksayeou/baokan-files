    Suggesting that the Lincheng County Government Quickly Repair Fengcun Bridge
    The Fengcun River in Lincheng County had a bridge erected a month ago. Later, a car damaged the bridge, but vehicles and pedestrians could still pass. Unexpectedly, someone from the village dismantled the bridge planks and hid them to the side. If someone wanted to cross the river, he would put the planks down, and crossing the bridge would cost money. When asked why he charged money, he said they were private planks. However, most people crossing the river did not pay. Seeing that this was not going to work, they hid the planks again. Water from both sides rushed into the middle, creating a gap three meters wide and two chi deep. Four or five young men waited by the river to carry people across, charging 1,000 Jiao (of the currency used in the region surrounding Hebei province) per person or vehicle. In this cold weather, those without money had to take off their shoes and socks to cross the river. I feel this is a very bad phenomenon. I request that the Lincheng County government and the Fengcun village cadres take responsibility to repair the bridge and organize the young people of Fengcun to engage in production, and stop doing this.

### 建议临城县政府赶快架修冯村桥

　　建议临城县政府赶快架修冯村桥
    临城县冯村河，在一个月前曾把桥搭起，后来汽车把桥压坏，但车子和行人还能走。不料该村有人把桥板拆了藏在一边，如果有人过河，他把木板搭上，过桥还得给钱，有人问他为啥要钱？他说是私人木板。但过河人大多数不给钱，他们看这个事情不行，就把木板又藏起来，两边的水都涌入当中，宽有三米，深二尺，四五个青年人在河边等着背，每人、每辆车子要一千元冀钞。这样冷的天气，没钱的只把鞋袜脱下来过河。这个事情我感觉是极不好的现象，请临城县政府和冯村村干部，负责修一下，并把冯村的年青人组织起来搞生产，别再干这个事情。
