　　Regarding the reactionary policy of US imperialism to arm Japan,
  　Soviet representative raised three reprimands
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. The Soviet representatives attending the Allied Council for Japan and the Far Eastern Commission have recently reprimanded MacArthur's reactionary policies of rearming Japan and interfering in the Japanese labor movement three times. At the meeting on January 5, Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, General Derevyanko, stated: The number of Japanese police has more than doubled since the surrender. According to official figures from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, there were 141,200 Japanese police officers by the end of October last year. According to Radio Tokyo, former commander of the US Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, proposed to increase the number of Japanese police to 275,000. If this measure is implemented, the number of Japanese police (including the so-called maritime police and railway police) will reach 300,000. In 1925, Japan only had an army of 200,000, but five years later, it invaded Northeast China. Therefore, increasing the number of Japanese police significantly represents a threat of the revival of Japanese armed forces. Derevyanko then pointed out: The Japanese government is rebuilding the centralized Japanese Police Headquarters under the guise of the so-called "Ten Cities Police Liaison Committee," and establishing six police districts according to the division of the former six military districts, which is very similar to establishing and training troops. At the same time, according to reports from Japanese labor unions and other organizations, there are still secret police in Japan. Derevyanko suggested limiting the number of Japanese police to 125,000, prohibiting increases, and ensuring the implementation of the Far Eastern Commission's decision to disband all Japanese secret police.
    On January 6, Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, also reprimanded MacArthur at the Far Eastern Commission for violating the commission's policy towards Japan and openly instructing the Japanese government to formulate anti-labor legislation on July 22 last year. The Japanese parliament passed anti-democratic measures on November 30 last year, prohibiting government employees from striking and collective bargaining. Pan pointed out: The Soviet delegation had requested the committee to make a decision on MacArthur's actions, but unfortunately, the majority of the committee took the path of approving MacArthur's anti-democratic measures. At this point, Pan solemnly declared: The Soviet delegation will continue to regard MacArthur's actions as a violation of the Allied policy on the democratization of Japan. Prior to this, Pan pointed out at the commission's meeting on December 30 that American newspapers had reported that MacArthur had submitted a report to Washington suggesting the reconstruction of the Japanese army and the rearmament of Japan. Pan requested that the US representative should submit a report on this matter to the Far Eastern Commission. However, the next day, the US State Department arbitrarily rejected the Soviet representative's request with the sophistry of "unfounded."

　　对美帝武装日本的反动政策
  　苏代表三次提出斥责
    【新华社陕北十三日电】苏联出席盟国对日委员会和远东委员会的代表，最近曾三次斥责麦克阿瑟重新武装日本和干涉日本职工运动的反动政策。苏出席盟国对日委员会代表德勒维扬哥将军在一月五日会议上发表声明称：日本警察自投降以来已扩大了两倍半。据日本大藏省的官方数字，日警察至去年十月底，已有十四万一千二百人。据东京电台称，美前第八军司令艾契伯格中将，曾提出建议将日本警察增至二十七万五千人。如果这一措施付诸实行，则日本警察（加上所谓海上警察和铁路警察）将达三十万人之巨。日本在一九二五年只有军队二十万人，但在五年后，它便进犯中国东北。由此可见，再增加为数甚多的日本警察，显然是代表日本武装力量复活的威胁。德勒维扬哥继而指出：日本政府正在所谓“十大城市警察联络委员会”的伪装下，重建集中的日本警察总署，并按前六个军区的划分设立六个警察区，这是极似于建立及训练军队的措施。同时，根据日本工会等团体提出的报告，日本现在还有秘密警察的存在。德勒维扬哥建议限制日警人数为十二万五千，禁止增加并保证执行远东委员会关于解散日本一切秘密警察的决定。
    一月六日，苏出席远东委员会代表潘友新，亦在远东委员会上斥责麦克阿瑟违反委员会所规定的对日政策，公然于去年七月二十二日指令日本政府制订反劳工的立法。而日本议会已于去年十一月三十日通过了禁止政府雇员罢工与集体议价的反民主措施。潘氏指出：苏联代表团曾要求委员会对麦克阿瑟这种行为，采取决定，但不幸委员会的多数，却走上了批准麦克阿瑟反民主措施的道路。潘氏至此严正声明：苏代表团将继续认为麦氏此举是违反盟国关于日本民主化的政策。在此以前，潘氏于该委员会十二月三十日的会议上，指出美国报纸曾报导麦克阿瑟曾向华盛顿提出报告，建议重建日本军队与重行武装日本。潘民要求美代表应就此事向远东委员会提出报告。但在次日，美国务院却武断地以“毫无根据”的诡辩，拒绝了苏代表的要求。
