　　Gaoluan and Other Counties Start from the Needs of the Masses
  　Combining Sideline Occupations to Establish Cooperatives
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the beginning of winter, Gaoluan and other counties in central Hebei have been promoting cooperatives, emphasizing the integration of party rectification and the completion of land reform work, and establishing cooperatives through the development of rural sideline production. In the beginning, cadres lacked experience and had no village cooperative foundation in the past, so they all felt lack of confidence. After concentrating efforts for a month, the two counties have initially established village cooperatives in nineteen villages. Experience has proven that "starting from the needs of the masses, democratically electing cadres, is easy to succeed; paternalistic substitution will surely take a detour." For example, the work team in the key village of Nan'an in Luancheng County, after learning that more than sixty waterwheels in the village had been in disrepair for years, seized the urgent demand of the masses for repairing waterwheels, and the characteristic of having many carpenters. They used various opportunities to promote the benefits of organizing cooperatives from inside and outside the party; and through party member cadres to deliberate, calling on the masses to pool shares to repair the waterwheels. At that time, the masses responded enthusiastically, but it was discovered that some people only shouted to invest shares but were unwilling to pay money, and only listened to the meeting without speaking. The work team promptly analyzed the masses still having concerns about "who will operate it in the end?" and immediately held a meeting to elect Yu Xinchun and other four people to be responsible. In three days, 95 households raised 9.5 million border currency, agreeing to mobilize eight carpenters, purchase raw materials, repair and manufacture waterwheels, and sell them to cooperative members at low prices. If the cooperative members provide their own wood, the labor is also cheaper; the profit is divided into 40% for labor shares and 60% for money shares, with settlement every three months. The agricultural tool production cooperative was successfully formed. At that time, some people advocated engaging in transportation and sales in order to make money, but were rejected by the majority of cooperative members. In the past half month, a batch of toon and locust wood has been purchased, cut into water bucket planks, and is being actively repaired and manufactured. Afterwards, cooperative members talked to each other: "We don't need to ask for too much, repairing all the village's agricultural tools and waterwheels will make next year's big production much more convenient." Beichen Village in the third district is a new village liberated during the Shijiazhuang Campaign. The textile industry is very developed. The enemy had forced the establishment of village cooperatives, and the masses had a very bad impression of them, calling them "living capture cooperatives." This time, at the end of land reform, there was still some unassigned floating wealth in the village. The representative meeting prepared to distribute it to the farmers who should be allocated it, driving the whole village to invest shares and form a cooperative, first discussing it in groups. Initially, the masses had a skeptical attitude, saying, "This is good, but I'm afraid no one can do it well!" When prestigious party member Zhao Rujin, Farmers Association Director Liu Lianchun and others formally came forward to organize, the masses immediately changed their opinions. Poor peasant Zhang Dongmei said, "If the things are divided zero, each person can't get 100,000 or 200,000, and can't even afford a candy basket. It's better to work together." Hao Yuezi said, "If the cooperative is done well, it can top planting several hectares of land!" Everyone said it was a good thing. Since then, middle peasants who had not divided the floating wealth, as well as some landlords and rich peasants, also signed up to invest shares. At the founding meeting on the 5th of this month, it was stipulated that one dou of rice would be counted as one share. Those whose floating wealth was priced at less than a full share would voluntarily make up the money. No one withdrew their share. Fourteen women including Ding Yu and Zunzi also completely invested their due share of floating wealth into the cooperative. In this way, a total of 32.9 million border currency was raised. They have now started to purchase safflower, operate the exchange of flowers for thread, and sell native cloth on consignment to support the local textile industry. The elected staff excitedly said: "Right now, we don't care about anything else. If we can guarantee that more than 100 looms and more than 600 spinning wheels in the village are operating smoothly, that will be a great achievement." In Dongsigong Village, Gaocheng County, the flood was serious and the harvest was small. They started by organizing the masses to raise shares to buy grain from stores, reducing the threat of price fluctuations, and gradually developed into more than 130 shares, 10 million border currency, forming a supply and marketing cooperative to support the textile industry. Beimeng Village grows the most peanuts, so they called on the masses to raise shares to extract oil, solving the fertilizer problem; therefore, they are all welcomed by the masses. Beilou Village did not do this. When the masses raised shares, the branch sent a party member who did not work well to be the director, and advocated operating liquor (selling alcohol), causing dissatisfaction among the masses, who quietly withdrew their shares. The above facts prove that the peasants after land reform have a higher level of consciousness and are urgently demanding cooperative production. However, this work has not yet attracted the attention of the county and district party committees, and timely supervision and inspection are rare, which is still a shortcoming.　　　　　　　(Xing Jun)

　　藁栾等县从群众需要入手
  　结合副业建立合作社
    【本报讯】入冬以来，冀中藁、栾等县推进社，重视结合整党与结束土改工作，从开展农村副业生产中建立合作社。开始，干部由于缺乏经验和过去没有村社基础，均感信心不足。经集中力量有重点的努力了一个月，两县已在十九个村庄初步建立了村社，经验证明：“从群众需要入手，民主选举干部，容易成功；包办代替必走弯路”。如栾城南安基点村工作组了解全村六十多卦水车大都连年失修的情况后，抓住群众修理水车的迫切要求，和木匠工人较多的特点，即利用各种机会，从党内外宣传组织合作社的好处；并通过党员干部进行酝酿，号召群众集股收拾水车。当时群众纷纷响应，但发现有的只喊入股不肯拿钱，光听会不发言的现象。工作组及时分析了群众尚存有不知“到底谁来经营”的顾虑，立即开会选出于新春等四人负责。三天工夫，即有九十五户集股边币九百五十万元，商定动员八个木匠工人，购买原料，修制水车，低价售予社员。如社员自给木料，手工也较便宜；营利按人股、钱股四六分红，三月一结帐，农具生产合作社便顺利组成。当时有的为赚钱，主张搞运销，被多数社员的意见否定了。半月来，已买到一批椿槐木，解为水斗板子，正积极修制。事后社员相互谈论：“咱们不用要求过高，把全村农具水车都修理好，明年大生产就便利多了。”三区北陈村是石门战役才解放的新村，纺织很发达，敌人曾强迫建立过村社，群众对其印象极坏，称之为“活捉社”。此次结束土改，村中尚存一部不便零分的浮财，代表会准备分给应分的农民，带动全村入股，组成合作社，先在小组进行讨论。初期群众抱有半信半疑的态度，都说：“这样，好可是好，就怕没人干不好！”等到有威信的党员赵如金，农会主任刘连春等正式出头组织，群众立刻变了舆论，贫农张东梅说：“东西零分了，一人落不了十万二十万的，连个糖篮子也搞不起，还是伙干好”。郝月子说：“合作社闹好了，可顶种几顷地哩！”都说这是个好事。从此未分浮财的中农，还有一些地、富，也报名入股。本月五号开成立会，规定一市斗米算一个股，分浮财折价不足整股者，多自愿补钱，没有一个撤份的；妇女丁玉、尊子等十四人，也将自己应分的浮财股份完全投入了合作社。这样共集股边币三千二百九十万，现已着手购买穰花，经营以花换线，并代销土布，扶植本村纺织。当选职员兴奋的说：“眼下先不顾别的，咱们能保证全村一百来张机子，六百多辆纺车，周转灵便，就是一大功”。在藁城东四公村，水灾严重，收成很少，即从组织群众集股到商店购买粮食，减少物价波动的威胁入手，逐渐发展到一百卅多股，边币一千万元，组成扶植纺织的供销合作社。北猛村种花生的最多，即号召群众集股打油，解决了肥料问题；因此均受群众欢迎。北楼村没有这样做，当群众集股的时候，支部派出一个劳动不好的党员当主任，并主张经营烧酒（卖酒），引起群众不满，悄悄的将股都撤了。从上述事实证明：土改后的农民，已有了较高的觉悟，并迫切要求合作生产，不过当前这一工作尚未引起县区党委应有的注意，及时督促检查很少，仍是缺点。　　　　　　　（行军）
