  　Linzhang Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau Promotes Boiling Saltpeter Instead of Sun-drying It
    [Jinan News] The saltpeter boiling activities in Linzhang County have not been paid attention to by the leadership. The county did not have a saltpeter and sulfur bureau, only the guest house collected it on behalf of the government, and the amount was very small. Some people in the masses believed that "Linzhang County cannot get rich by producing saltpeter in a large scale"; a few people who knew how to extract saltpeter held feudal and superstitious conservative views. They didn't allow people to watch when extracting saltpeter, and didn't allow people to comment on the water flowing out, thinking that if others saw it, they wouldn't be able to extract saltpeter and would lose money. This summer, the county received instructions from higher authorities: in order to support the war, promote the sideline production of the masses, and only then began to pay attention to leadership. First, a saltpeter and sulfur bureau was established, and then people were invited to inspect the saltpeter soil in the county. It was said that there was saltpeter, so they began to hold meetings with the masses to explain that the country needed it, and the masses would benefit from it, one jin of saltpeter for six jin of rice; but after more than half a month of propaganda and urging, the masses remained the same, and still did not see more people sweeping soil and leaching saltpeter. The leading comrades were bored and said, "People don't believe it, they don't move, what can we do?" So they went to visit the saltpeter sweeping households again. But as soon as you entered the door, the head of the household would lead you into the house and treat you politely; but they would not let you go to the leaching pool and the saltpeter water tank, meaning they were afraid of losing money if you talked about it, and also afraid of strong leadership. Once this tank of water was ruined, the whole family would have no food to eat, so it was better to deal with you and let you leave. The comrades of the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau were so bored that they had no way, so they conducted extensive investigation and research to see where the root of the problem was. Later, they found two problems: one was the superstition of the masses; the other was that the masses only knew how to sun-dry saltpeter, not how to boil it. If they swept the soil this winter, they would not be able to sun-dry the saltpeter until March next year. Third, the masses accumulated a tank of saltpeter water very carefully. If they could not extract saltpeter, it would be like breaking their rice bowl. At this time, the comrades of the Saltpeter Bureau decided to take action themselves and lead the masses with practical actions. So they hired a group of saltpeter boilers from Futudian, Jize County, and began scraping soil and boiling saltpeter while inviting the masses to visit and learn; after two experiments, the first time it failed to boil out because the well water was not right (containing unsuitable minerals); the second time they invited a boiler from Jize again and re-boiled it, and finally the experiment was successful. It turned out that the water and soil here needed a longer period of cooling (one day and one night) to precipitate the saltpeter. In this way, without propaganda, the masses in each street knew about it. Some said, "Look, there will be a lot of disputes when sweeping saltpeter soil next spring." Some said, "It's so good to get saltpeter by lighting a fire! In the past, our saltpeter water in winter could not be turned into money until next spring, how stupid!" Now the masses in each street have increased their confidence in boiling saltpeter, and are competing to sweep soil and accumulate water to start boiling saltpeter. The comrades of the Saltpeter Bureau widely invite the masses to visit, and say to the masses: "We are not superstitious, we are not afraid of being watched. As long as it is saltpeter soil, we can always extract saltpeter. If it is not saltpeter soil, no one can boil it even if they watch us." Now the Saltpeter Bureau has begun to purchase saltpeter, and has collected more than 4,500 jin in just half a month. The Saltpeter Bureau plans to focus on the city this winter, and expand to various townships next spring, and plans to use demonstration methods to open training classes to promote the saltpeter boiling work throughout the county.

　　请把式熬硝给大家看
  　临漳硝磺局推动群众以熬硝代替晒硝
    【冀南讯】临漳县的熬硝活动，一直没有被领导上注意过。县里也没有硝磺局，只是由招待所代收，为数也很少。群众中有的认为“临漳县出硝不成庄，不发财”；少数会提硝的人存在着封建迷信的保守观点，提硝时不叫人看，淋出水来不叫人说，以为被人见了，就弄不出硝来，就要破财。今夏县里接到上级指示：为了支援战争，提倡群众的副业生产，才开始注意领导。首先成立了硝磺局，随着请人检查本县硝土。据说有硝，于是就开始向群众开会解释，说明国家需要，群众有利，一斤硝六斤米；但宣传督促了半月多，群众依然如故，仍不见更多的人扫土淋硝。领导的同志发了闷，说：“人家不信、不动，咱有啥法？”于是又去访问扫硝户。但一进门，户主就把你领到屋里，客气的来招待；却不让去淋池和硝水缸的跟前，意思是怕被说破了财，同时也怕强下手领导。一旦坏了这缸水，全家人就没了饭碗，不如支应你出了门完事。硝磺局的同志闷的没法了，就广泛的调查研究，看看病根在哪里。后发现两个问题：一是群众迷信；二是群众只会晒硝，不会熬硝。今冬扫土，要到明年三月才能晒出硝来。三是群众积蓄一缸硝水，很慎重，如弄不出硝来，就等于打破饭碗。这时硝局同志研究决定，要亲自动手，用实际行动来带领群众。于是从鸡泽县浮图店请来一班熬硝的，一面开始刮土熬硝，一面请群众参观学习；经过两次试验，第一次因井水不对（含矿质不合适）没熬出来；二次又到鸡泽请来把式，重新再熬，终于试验成功。原来这里的水土须要较长时间的冷却（一昼夜）才能坐硝。这样一来不用宣传，各街的群众都知道了。有的说：“看吧，明年春天扫硝土，少不了争吵。”有的说：“点着火就出硝，多好呀！咱们过去冬天的硝水，非到明年春天不能成钱，多么笨！”现各街群众提高了熬硝信心，争着扫土积水，开始熬硝。硝局同志广泛请群众参观，并对群众说：“咱这不迷信、不怕看，只要是硝土，总能弄出硝，如不是硝土，没人看咱也熬不成。”现硝局已开始收买硝，只半月就收了四千五百多斤。硝局计划，今冬领导重点在城里，明春要扩大到各乡，并打算用示范办法，开训练班，以推广全县的熬硝工作。（少真）
