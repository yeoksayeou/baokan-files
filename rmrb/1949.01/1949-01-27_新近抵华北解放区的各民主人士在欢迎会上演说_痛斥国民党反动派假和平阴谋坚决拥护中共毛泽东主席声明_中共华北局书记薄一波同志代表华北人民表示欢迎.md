Xinhua News Agency, North China, 25th: A number of representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and non-party democratic figures, who recently arrived in the North China Liberated Area from the Kuomintang-controlled areas and overseas, delivered speeches at a grand welcoming rally held on the 20th by the North China People's Government and the North China Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party. They vehemently denounced the Kuomintang reactionaries' sham peace plot under the instigation of American imperialism and resolutely supported the proposal for establishing genuine democratic peace put forward in the statement of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party on January 14th. Among those attending the welcoming rally were non-party democratic figures Li Xijiu and Fu Dingyi, Zhou Jianren of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Hu Yuzhi, Wu Han, Chu Tunan, Han Zhaoe, Liu Qingyang, Yan Xinmin, and He Ju of the China Democratic League, democratic figures from the cultural circles Jian Bozan, Tian Han, Yang Gang, Huan Xiang, An E, and Meng Qiujiang, democratic figures from the women's circles Shen Zijiu, Zhang Manjun, Zhou Ying, Yuan Zhen, Shen Qiang, and Wang Yunru, and Shanghai worker representatives Zhu Junxin and Ouyang Zurun, etc. Before the meeting, a welcoming banquet was held, during which Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, and Fu Dingyi and Zhou Jianren delivered impromptu speeches on behalf of the host and guests, expressing mutual respect. At the welcoming rally, Comrade Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Central Bureau of the CCP, first delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the people of North China. In his speech, he expressed warm welcome to the democratic figures who came from Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Nanyang and other places to the liberated areas to jointly participate in the Chinese people's liberation cause. He went on to say that at a time when the People's Liberation War is advancing victoriously and the Kuomintang reactionary government is about to collapse, the Kuomintang reactionary government has not expressed any attitude towards Chairman Mao's statement of January 14th, but has put forward a request for so-called unconditional ceasefire. This, like the peace talks proposed by Chiang Kai-shek under five reactionary conditions, is a political conspiracy directed by American imperialism, the purpose of which is to preserve the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang government, gain a breathing space, rest and reorganize, so as to stage a comeback and extinguish the revolution. The Chinese Communist Party has always hoped for peace. After the Japanese surrender, Chairman Mao personally went to Chongqing for negotiations and signed the Double Tenth Agreement. After the Double Tenth Agreement was torn up by the Kuomintang reactionary government, the Chinese Communist Party cooperated with various democratic parties and democratic figures to strive to convene the Political Consultative Conference, and forced the Kuomintang to sign the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. But these agreements and resolutions were still torn up by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now the Kuomintang reactionary government is proposing "peace" again, but this proposal is hypocritical and reactionary. Whether it is the five reactionary conditions put forward by Chiang Kai-shek, such as maintaining the pseudo-legal system, the pseudo-constitution, and maintaining the reactionary army, or the so-called unconditional ceasefire proposed by the pseudo-Executive Yuan, are absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. If we accept this reactionary and hypocritical peace, it would be tantamount to completely abandoning the results obtained by the Chinese people through bloodshed and sacrifice for independence and liberation for nearly a hundred years, especially in the past thirty years. Chairman Mao's current affairs statement of January 14th put forward eight conditions as the basis for peace talks. These eight conditions fully reflect the wishes of the people of the whole country. Only by fully realizing these eight conditions can China have genuine democratic peace. Apart from this, it is impossible to imagine what true peace would be. Regardless of whether the Kuomintang reactionary government accepts this genuine democratic peace or not, the Chinese people must realize their own goals. In the near future, various democratic parties and people's organizations in China will convene a new Political Consultative Conference without the participation of reactionary elements, establish a democratic coalition government, and establish the People's Republic of China. It is hoped that all democratic forces in the country will unite as one and work hard for this great task.

Hu Yuzhi, Chairman of the Malayan Branch of the Democratic League, then delivered a speech. He said that he had just returned to China from overseas and was willing to reflect the voices of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese love their motherland and eagerly hope that their motherland will be independent, unified, democratic, prosperous and strong. For more than a hundred years, every revolution in the country has been frustrated midway, which has deeply disappointed overseas Chinese. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, overseas Chinese enthusiastically contributed money and efforts. Unfortunately, most of the fruits of victory were stolen by American imperialism and the Kuomintang, and most of the motherland is still in a state of slavery. Overseas Chinese are bullied everywhere, which is particularly heartbreaking. Based on their past experiences and their love for their motherland, overseas Chinese hope that this people's revolutionary struggle must thoroughly realize the people's wishes. Hu Yuzhi said that the current peace proposal of the Kuomintang government is false, and we should see through the hearts of these wolves and dogs and not be fooled. As the saying goes, "You won't shed tears until you see the coffin." The Kuomintang's war criminals will not shed tears even when they see the coffin, or they will only shed fake tears, with the aim of seeking the people's pity so as to rest and wait for an opportunity to rise again. We must not have any illusions about them. He said that he fully supported Chairman Mao's current affairs statement of January 14th. The eight conditions for the basis of peace talks shown in the statement not only represent the public opinion of the people in the country, but also reflect the wishes of overseas Chinese. Only when the Kuomintang fully accepts these eight conditions can China have genuine peace.

Zhu Junxin, Shanghai worker representative and executive member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the Kuomintang's war criminals are like a group of mad dogs. We must chase them to the ends of the earth and bring them to justice. Even if they fall into the water, we must not let them go. If we let them go, they will shake their fur and bite people again when they turn around. Zhu Junxin said: We must not be fooled! Haven't we suffered enough in the past? He painfully recalled the history stained with blood. He said that in the Great Revolution of 1927, the Shanghai Uprising succeeded three times. Workers and students sent representatives to welcome the Kuomintang troops into the city, but as a result, a large number of young people were slaughtered. Shortly after the signing of the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas. In the autumn of 1946, tens of thousands of people in Shanghai escorted their representatives to Nanjing to petition, demanding that the Kuomintang cease the war and make peace. What was the answer the representatives received? They were beaten up in Xiaguan. Many people who opposed the civil war and demanded peace were arrested and imprisoned. Today, if they are truly sincere about peace, they must accept the eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao on our behalf. Not a single one of these eight conditions can be missing.

Wu Han, professor at Tsinghua University and member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, said that the eight conditions in Chairman Mao Zedong's statement are a guarantee of China's peace and democracy. Only by implementing these eight conditions without discount can China have genuine peace and the people can be truly liberated. The three conditions of confiscating bureaucratic capital, reforming the land system, and abolishing traitorous treaties are necessary steps to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; the four conditions of punishing war criminals, abolishing the pseudo-constitution, abolishing the pseudo-legal system, and reorganizing all reactionary troops in accordance with democratic principles are necessary steps to abolish the Kuomintang reactionary rule and prevent the recurrence of civil war; and the final condition of convening a political consultative conference without the participation of reactionary elements, establishing a democratic coalition government, and taking over all powers of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and its subordinate governments at all levels is a necessary step to establish a people's democratic republic and realize New Democracy. Supporting or opposing these eight conditions is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, democracy and anti-democracy, and the people and anti-people. Any party, group, or individual, whether he is a friend of the people, an enemy of the people, or a friend of the enemy, the people will measure him according to his attitude towards these eight conditions.

Han Zhaoe, member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, said that the Kuomintang government's current "peace" proposal is obviously a deceptive act and no one will believe it. Chairman Mao's eight conditions are the basis for implementing genuine peace, and the Kuomintang is absolutely not allowed to bargain or take advantage of loopholes. If the Kuomintang government accepts it, it should implement it as soon as possible and hand over power to the Chinese people for takeover and reorganization; otherwise, the people will resolutely eliminate it and not allow it any chance to survive. Chu Tunan, a university professor and member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, said in his speech, reviewing the history of nearly forty years, he couldn't help but sigh: China's democrats have experienced a difficult and tortuous road. Now, due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, Chinese history has opened up a new realm, and democrats can stride forward on a free and broad road. He recounted what he saw and heard after arriving in the liberated area, saying: The place where these 200 million people live has a clear sky in their hearts and the sun above their heads. The land, the people, men and women, have all been liberated and are full of vitality and creativity, which guarantees the prosperity and happiness of the new China. I am deeply willing to do my utmost under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the current great movement of the people's revolution, to do all that a modern Chinese should do.

Playwright and poet Tian Han recited two new works on stage. In these two poems, he described the different lives in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang areas, and the different encounters of young men and women. In the former poem, he reminisced about Yang Chao, who had been killed, and Luo Binji, who had recently been sentenced, and excitedly called out that now those war criminals should be allowed to change shifts with Luo Binji. Jian Bozan used the facts he saw along the way after entering the liberated area to denounce the so-called rumors fabricated by the Kuomintang secret service that the Communist Party did not want culture and intellectuals. He called on intellectuals in the Kuomintang areas to stand by their posts and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army. Yang Gang, a former reporter for the Dagong Bao, compared the different lives of women she saw in the United States and in the liberated areas, pointing out that in the United States, women do not actually have equal status, while women in the Chinese liberated areas have truly been liberated.

　　新近抵华北解放区的各民主人士在欢迎会上演说
    痛斥国民党反动派假和平阴谋坚决拥护中共毛泽东主席声明
    中共华北局书记薄一波同志代表华北人民表示欢迎
    【新华社华北二十五日电】新近由国民党统治区和海外来到华北解放区的各民主党派、各人民团体代表和无党派民主人士多人，廿日在华北人民政府和中国共产党华北中央局所举行的盛大欢迎会上发表演说，痛斥国民党反动派在美帝国主义主使下的假和平阴谋，坚决拥护中国共产党毛泽东主席一月十四日声明中所提出的建立真正民主和平的主张。出席这个欢迎会的有无党派民主人士李锡九、符定一，中国民主促进会的周建人，中国民主同盟的胡愈之、吴晗、楚图南、韩兆鹗、刘清扬、严信民、何惧，文化界民主人士翦伯赞、田汉、杨刚、宦乡、安娥、孟秋江，妇女界民主人士沈兹九、张曼筠、周颖、袁震、沈强、王蕴如，上海工人代表朱俊欣、欧阳祖润等。会前曾作欢宴，华北人民政府主席董必武和符定一、周建人代表主客双方即席致辞，互相表示敬意。在欢迎大会上，首先有中共华北中央局书记薄一波代表华北人民致欢迎词。他在讲话中对于从北平、上海、香港、南洋等地来到解放区共同参加中国人民解放事业的各民主人士表示热烈的欢迎。他接着说，当人民解放战争正在胜利地推进，国民党反动政府即将覆亡的时候，国民党反动政府对于毛主席一月十四日的声明不表示任何态度，却提出了所谓无条件停战的要求，这与蒋介石提出的在五项反动条件下进行和平谈判一样，都是美帝国主义导演下的一种政治阴谋，其目的在于保存国民党政府的残余反动力量，取得喘息时间，休息整顿，以便卷土重来，扑灭革命。中国共产党从来是希望和平的。在日本投降以后，毛主席曾亲赴重庆进行谈判，签订了双十协定。在双十协定被国民党反动政府撕毁以后，中国共产党又和各民主党派、民主人士协作，争取召开了政治协商会议，并迫使国民党在停战协定和政协决议上签了字。但这些协定和决议，仍然被国民党反动派所撕毁。现在国民党反动政府又建议“和平”了，但这个建议是虚伪的反动的。无论蒋介石所提出的保持伪法统，伪宪法，保持反动军队等五项反动条件，或伪行政院所提出的所谓无条件停战，都是中国人民所绝对不能接受的。如果接受这种反动的虚伪的和平，那就等于将中国人民近百年来，尤其是近三十年来为求独立解放而流血牺牲所获得的成果完全抛弃。毛主席一月十四日时局声明，提出八个条件作为和平谈判的基础，这八个条件完全反映了全国人民的愿望。只有完全实现这八个条件，中国才能有真正的民主的和平。除此而外，不可能设想会有什么真和平。无论国民党反动政府是否接受这种真正的民主的和平，中国人民都一定要实现自己的奋斗目标。在不久的将来，中国各民主党派和人民团体即将召开没有反动分子参加的新的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，建立中华人民民主共和国。希望全国一切民主力量团结一致，为这个伟大的任务而努力。
    继由民主同盟马来亚支部主任委员胡愈之讲演。他说：他新从海外归国，愿意反映海外华侨的呼声。华侨热爱祖国，切盼祖国独立、统一、民主、富强。百余年来，国内每次革命均中途顿挫，曾使华侨深感失望。抗日战争期间，华侨热心的出钱出力，不幸胜利果实大部分被美帝国主义和国民党所窃取，祖国大部分仍处奴隶状态，华侨在外到处受人欺凌，尤为痛心疾首。华侨根据历次经验，本其爱护祖国之忱，希望这次人民革命斗争一定要彻底实现人民的愿望。胡愈之说：国民党政府现在的和平建议是假的，我们应看穿这辈狼狗的心，切勿上当。俗语说：“不见棺材不流泪”，国民党的战争罪犯们，见了棺材也不流泪，或者是只流假泪，目的在于求得人民的怜悯，以便休息一下，待机再起。我们对他们决不能抱任何幻想。他说，他完全拥护毛主席一月十四日的时局声明。声明所示和谈基础的八个条件，不仅代表国内人民的公意，且也反映海外华侨的愿望，只有国民党完全接受这八个条件，中国才有真正的和平可言。
    上海工人代表、全国总工会执行委员朱俊欣说：国民党的战争罪犯们好比一群疯狗，我们一定要把他们追到天涯海角，务使归案法办，就是它们落到水里去，我们也决不能把它们放了。如果把它们放了，它们毛一抖，回头就又会咬人的。朱俊欣说：不能上当啊！过去我们吃的苦头还不够吗？他沉痛地回忆起血迹斑斑的历史来。他说，一九二七年大革命，上海三次起义成功，工人、学生派代表迎接国民党军队进城，结果大批的青年遭到屠杀。停战协定和政协决议签订不久，国民党就向解放区进行大规模进攻。一九四六年秋，上海几万人民欢送自己的代表到南京请愿，要求国民党停战言和，代表们得到的回答是什么呢？就是在下关挨了一顿痛打。很多反对内战要求和平的人都被逮捕、被监禁。今天他们如果真有和平诚意，就必须接受毛主席代表我们提出的八个条件。这八个条件一条也不能少，少一条就不行。
    清华大学教授、民主同盟中央委员吴晗说：毛泽东主席声明的八个条件，是中国和平民主的保障。只有不折不扣地实现这八个条件，中国才有真正的和平，人民才能得到真正的解放。八条中的没收官僚资本，改革土地制度，废除卖国条约等三条，这是反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的必要步骤；惩办战争罪犯，废除伪宪法，废除伪法统，依据民主原则改编一切反动军队等四条，这是取消国民党反动统治、制止内战再起的必要步骤；而最后一条，召开没有反动分子参加的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，接收南京国民党反动政府及其所属各级政府的一切权力，则是建立人民民主共和国、实现新民主主义的必要步骤。拥护或反对这八个条件，是革命与反革命、民主与反民主、人民与反人民的分野。任何党派、团体或个人，究竟他是人民的朋友，还是人民的敌人，或敌人的朋友，人民会根据他对这八个条件的态度如何来加以衡量。
    民主同盟中央委员韩兆鹗说：国民党政府现在的“和平”建议，显然是欺骗行为，不会有人相信。毛主席的八个条件，是实行真正的和平的基础，决不允许国民党讨价还价，投机取巧。国民党政府如果接受，就应该及早执行，把政权交给中国人民来接收整理；否则，人民就要坚决消灭掉它，不让它有苟延残喘的机会。民主同盟中央委员大学教授楚图南在讲话中回顾近四十年的历史，不胜感慨地说：中国的民主主义者曾经经历艰难曲折的道路，现在由于人民解放战争的胜利，中国历史开辟了新的境界，民主主义者可以大踏步地走上自由宽阔的大路了。他缕述到解放区后的所见所闻说：这二万万人口所居住的地方，心上有青天，头顶有太阳。土地、人民、男的、女的都得到了解放，富有生命力和创造力，这就保证了新中国的富强和康乐。本人深愿在中国共产党领导之下，在当前人民革命的大运动中，竭尽一个现代的中国人应尽的力量。
    剧作家和诗人田汉上台朗诵了两首新作。在这两首诗中，他描写了解放区和国民党区两个社会的不同生活，男女青年的不同遭遇。在前一首诗中，他怀念已被杀害的杨潮和最近被判徒刑的骆宾基，而兴奋地呼号现在要让那些战犯们来和骆宾基换班。翦伯赞以其进入解放区后沿途所见事实，痛斥国民党特务机关制造的所谓共产党不要文化和知识分子的谣言。他号召现在国民党区的知识分子各自站住岗位，准备迎接解放军。前大公报记者杨刚对比她在美国和在解放区所见的两种不同的妇女生活，指明：在美国，妇女实际上没有平等地位，而中国解放区的妇女则真正得到了解放。
