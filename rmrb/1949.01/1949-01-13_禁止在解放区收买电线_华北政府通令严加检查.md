　　Prohibition of Purchasing Electrical Wire in Liberated Areas
  　North China Government Issues Order for Strict Inspection
    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China People's Government issued an instruction on December 13th of last year to governments at all levels, strictly prohibiting the purchase of electrical wire in the Liberated Areas. The instruction stated: As major cities in North China are about to be fully liberated, telecommunications construction is becoming even more important. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our military, government, civilian organizations, and groups encouraged the people to destroy the enemy's electrical wires. The impact of this continues to this day, with incidents of damaging electrical wires in the Liberated Areas still occurring. Upon investigation, the reasons for this include, on the one hand, planned sabotage by special agents and bandits. However, the purchase of electrical wire by our public stores in the Liberated Areas is also an important factor in increasing the damage. In order to eliminate the act of cutting wires for profit, a special order is hereby issued stating that no organizations, stores, or troops are allowed to purchase electrical wire within the Liberated Areas (including both inside the North China Region and other neighboring Liberated Areas). Departments requiring electrical wire may procure it from enemy-occupied areas through import and export stores. From the date of this order, anyone found still purchasing electrical wire in the Liberated Areas will be punished upon discovery. After receiving this order, you must promptly notify your subordinates to conduct strict inspections and announce and explain this to the broad masses of the people, in order to ensure its thorough implementation.

　　禁止在解放区收买电线
  　华北政府通令严加检查
    【本报讯】华北人民政府去年十二月十三日训令各级政府，严禁在解放区收买电线。训令称：华北各大城市即将全部解放，电讯建设更臻重要，抗战期间，我军政民机关团体曾鼓励人民破坏敌之电线，影响所及，至今仍不断有破坏解放区电线情事。查其原因，其中固有一部分为特务匪徒有计划的破坏行动，但我公营商店在解放区收购电线，亦系增加破坏之一重要原因。为杜绝图利割线行为，兹特通令凡在解放区内（包括华北区内部及其他友邻解放区）不准任何机关、商店、部队收买电线。须要电线部门，可经出入口商店从敌占区采购。自令到之日起，如仍有在解放区收买电线者，一经查获，定予处分。接令后仰即迅速通知所属严加检查，并向广大人民宣布解释，以期贯彻执行为要。
