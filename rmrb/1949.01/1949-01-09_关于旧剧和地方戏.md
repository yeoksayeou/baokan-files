Regarding Old Operas and Local Operas
    Zhitīng

    On November 13, 1937, the People's Daily published a special article entitled "Carry out Old Opera Reform Work in a Planned and Step-by-Step Manner." I agree with the importance, principles, and methods of reforming old operas as pointed out in the special article. However, that only addressed opinions on content reform, and rarely touched on formal aspects. Here, I would like to share some personal, fragmented impressions and opinions solely on the formal aspects of old operas.

    In my hometown, we didn't have theaters. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, we would set up temporary stages and perform on elevated platforms. I often squeezed into the audience, standing still for half the day watching the performances. When I was young, I watched a lot of Hāhāqiāng (Liǔzi Tune); later, more Hebei Bangzi was performed, and in the years before the War of Resistance, Píhuáng (Beijing Opera) also increased. I also saw two "Sīxián" and "Lǎodiào" troupes perform once or twice, who came from one or two hundred miles away. At that time, I was young and didn't understand the subtleties, and I didn't care about the content or meaning of the plays. I watched plays purely for entertainment and to relieve boredom. Even so, I had different impressions of the different forms of old operas.

    (1) The lyrics of Bangzi and Píhuáng were mostly unclear and incomprehensible. For example, the Bangzi opera "South Heavenly Gate" (Walking Through the Snow Mountain), I have seen no less than twenty times since I was a child, but I have never understood a single sentence. Only the final dialogue, "Ahead, it's dark and foggy, if it's not a village, it's a temple," always registered. The high-pitched vocals of Píngjù (Píhuáng) are even harder to hear clearly. I have seen "Lady Sun's Sacrifice to the River" and "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" many times, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't understand them. Only "Dìngjūn Mountain," sung in a loud voice, where "Xià Hóuyuān's martial arts are indeed good..." was still discernible. This may not only be related to the tune and music; the use of non-vernacular language is also a reason.

    (2) The lyrics of Hāhāqiāng, Píngxì (Bèngbèng, Luòzi), etc., are clear and vernacular, and the vast majority can be understood by the audience; in addition to being clear and vernacular, Sīxián and Lǎodiào also have pleasing music. Moreover, the content mostly depicts the deeds of ordinary people and is closer to rural life.

    Based on the above impressions, I put forward the following points:

    (1) In the reform of old operas in rural areas, the focus should be on local operas. It's not to say that Píhuáng should be completely abandoned. Modified and newly written historical dramas are still suitable for urban audiences and cadres, but in rural areas, they are not as good as local operas. For example, young people under the age of twenty in rural areas have very vague impressions of old operas. Now, when they listen to old operas, it is not easy to understand the singing, dialogue, or opening poems. Now they don't study classical Chinese, who knows what is meant by "Golden well locks wutong, long sighs in the air several winds" or "Each is the master of the brave troops"? If new historical dramas are created, it is not easy to use modern colloquial language in Píngjù. Local operas have always been vernacular, so it is best to use the form of local opera to create new historical dramas in rural areas, and use less or no Píngjù. We might as well experiment and perform the play "The River God Takes a Bride" in various forms such as Píngjù, Bangzi, Sīxián, Píngxì, Hāhāqiāng, Dìngxian Yāngge… to see which has a better effect.

    (2) Regarding Hebei Bangzi (although it is also a local opera), some people say that this form is good, generous and tragic, suitable for the temperament of the North. There is some truth to this, but what to do if the singing is not clear? For example, in the "The Story of Qin Xianglian," the more indignant and impassioned Bāo Gōng is, the less clear his singing becomes. Some people advocate using "real" voices to sing, but I don't think that's a good idea. It doesn't sound powerful enough. How to transform it, I hope those who study music will offer more opinions.

    (3) As for writing about modern events using old forms, local operas are even better than Píngjù. There are many successful examples in this regard. "Blood and Tears of Revenge" performed in Shaanxi with Qinqiang and ＠＠ had a very good effect; "Zhōu Zǐshān" used Dàoqing tunes. From 1942 to 1945, many operas in northern Shaanxi were performed using ＠＠, Dàoqing, Qinqiang and other local operas. In central Hebei, I also saw couples learning to read, virtuous little sister-in-law...etc. In the winter of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Zhangjiakou used Píngxì to perform "The Execution of Yáng Xiǎojiǎo," and Jizhong's "Zhāng Jīnhǔ Joins the Army" used Liǔzi tune. These plays had good effects.

    In short, in the vast rural areas, the utilization and reform of old operas should not ignore local operas. The People's Daily's special article also mentioned that "special emphasis should be placed on the reform of local operas," and said: "The excavation of this part of the heritage will be extremely valuable for reforming and building China's new national opera."

    Of course, local operas also have many shortcomings. The feudal, backward, obscene, and other toxins in the content must be strictly corrected; the acting skills and stage style must also be transformed.

    I hope that those in the know will correct these "layman" opinions that I have put forward!

### 关于旧剧和地方戏

　　关于旧剧和地方戏
    芷汀
    三十七年十一月十三日，人民日报曾刊载专论“有计划有步骤地进行旧剧改革工作”一文，我赞同专论所指出的改造旧剧的重要性及方针、方法。但那只是对内容方面改革的意见，对形式方面却很少涉及。这里，我想谈一点个人的仅仅关于旧剧形式方面的零星印象和意见。
    我们乡下没有戏院子，抗战前都是拉大篷、唱高台，我常常挤在观众中间站着半天不动的看戏。我小的时候，看的哈哈腔（柳子调）多；后来多唱河北梆子，抗战前几年唱皮簧的也不少了。也曾看了两台“丝弦”和“老调”班，那是一二百里以外的戏班串过来的一两次。那时，我年轻，不懂眼，更不管戏的内容、意义如何了。看戏完全是为了看热闹、解闷。虽然如此，但对几种不同形式的旧剧也留下些不同的印象。
    （一）梆子和皮簧的唱词，大部分听不清和听不懂。例如，梆子的南天门（走雪山）一出戏，我从小看了不下二十次，但从来没听出一句来，只有最后道白“前面黑压压、雾沉沉，不是村庄便是庙宇，每次都能入耳。平剧（皮簧）的小嗓更难听清了。我看过不少次的“孙夫人祭江”、“天女散花”，用心听也没办法，只有大嗓唱的“定军山”中“夏侯渊武艺果然好……”还能听得出来。这恐不仅是调门及音乐的关系，词句不通俗也是一个原因。
    （二）哈哈腔、评戏（蹦蹦、落子）等唱词清楚、通俗，绝大部分能使观众听清听懂；丝弦、老调除清楚、通俗外，音乐也很悦耳。且内容多是表演的平民事迹，和农村生活比较接近。
    根据以上印象，我提出下面几点意见：
    （一）在农村的旧剧改革工作，重点应放在地方戏上面。也不是说皮簧就完全不要了，经过修改的和新编的历史剧演给城市观众和干部看还合适，如果在乡间就不如地方戏。举例说：乡间二十岁以下的青年，对旧剧印象都很淡漠了。现在听起旧剧来，不论唱、道白、上场诗都不易听懂。现在又不学习文言，谁知道什么叫“金井锁梧桐，长叹空中几阵风”、“各为其主统貔貅”呢？如果创造新的历史剧，平剧也不好用现代化的口语。地方戏则一向是通俗的，所以在农村创造新历史剧最好也是用地方戏的形式，少用或不用平剧。我们不妨试验一下，把“河伯娶妇”一剧，用平剧、梆子、丝弦、评戏、哈哈腔、定县秧歌……各种不同形式演出，看看那种效果好。
    （二）关于河北梆子（虽然也是地方戏），有人说这种形式不错，慷慨悲歌，适合北方的民性，这一点不是没道理，但唱出来叫人听不清怎么办呢？比方：“铡美案”中包公的唱词，越是他愤慨激昂的时候，也越听不清了，有人主张用“真”嗓唱，我认为那不是好办法，听来实在不够气魄。如何改造，希望研究音乐的多提意见好了。
    （三）至于写现代发生的事件利用旧形式，地方戏更胜于平剧了。这方面成功的例子很多，“血泪仇”在陕北用秦腔、＠＠演出效果很好；“周子山”用道情调。一九四二到四五年陕北很多歌剧是利用＠＠、道情、秦腔等地方戏演出的。冀中也见到过夫妻识字、小姑贤……等。张家口在三十四年冬用评戏演出“枪决杨小脚”，冀中的“张金虎参军”用柳子调，这些戏效果都不错的。
    总之，在广大的农村，对于旧剧的利用和改革工作，不应该忽视地方戏。人民日报的专论上也提到“应当特别着重地方戏的改革”，并且说：“这部分遗产的发掘，对于改革与建设中国民族的新歌剧将是极为珍贵的。”
    当然，地方戏同样有它很多的缺点，内容的封建、落后、淫乱等毒素，必须严加纠正；在演技上、舞台作风上也必须改造。
    上面我提的这些“外行”的意见，希望识者指正！
