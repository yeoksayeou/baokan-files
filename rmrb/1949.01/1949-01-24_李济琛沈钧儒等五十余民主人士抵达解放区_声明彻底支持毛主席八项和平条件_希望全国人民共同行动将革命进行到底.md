　　We have now arrived in the liberated areas one after another. Recalling May 1st of last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the whole country and suggested convening a new political consultative conference including various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures to accelerate the overthrow of the Nanjing traitorous dictatorial rule and realize a people's democratic united government. We unanimously believe that this proposition for resolving national affairs is in line with the demands of the broad masses of the people across the country. We took the lead in responding via telegram and successively entered the liberated areas. In the course of the People's Liberation War, we are willing to dedicate our modest efforts under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, jointly devise strategies, and strive to achieve the rapid success of the Chinese people's democratic revolution and the early realization of a new China with independence, freedom, peace, and happiness.

　　After entering the liberated areas, our first impression filled us with great satisfaction. Here is an atmosphere full of democracy and freedom, and a spirit of vigorous upward progress. Production and construction are developing rapidly. Social order is well-organized. All sectors of workers, peasants, merchants, and students can stand on their own posts, work hard, and support the front lines. The Communist Party members, in particular, can set an example, display the courage of exceeding self-sacrifice, serve as pioneers for the people, and spare no effort. And the People's Liberation Army, which has rendered great service, is launching successive offensives with the power of thunder, annihilating more than one million Chiang Kai-shek's troops in three months, and liberating the entire Northeast, and almost the entire North China and Central China. The spearhead of the military has already pointed to the south bank of the Yangtze River. There is no doubt that China will achieve comprehensive liberation within 1949.

　　Under these circumstances, the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionaries, sheltered by American imperialism, are indeed on the verge of collapse. Since military struggles have been hopeless, they have changed their tricks, attempting to prolong their lives with political conspiracies. As early as when the Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the northern front began to collapse, American imperialism had launched its conspiracy activities, adopting a two-pronged poisonous plan to undermine the Chinese revolution. On the one hand, it attempted to brew opposition organizations within the revolutionary camp, hoping to stop or slow down the steps of the revolution; on the other hand, it instigated the Nanjing reactionaries to launch a peace offensive in order to buy time, allowing the remaining counter-revolutionary forces to make a final struggle in the south of the Yangtze River or remote provinces. This is something that deserves our vigilance.

　　Today, we must clearly express our beliefs. We believe that the revolution must be carried through to the end, and there is absolutely no possibility of compromise or reconciliation between revolution and counter-revolution. We should firmly remember the painful lessons of previous failures since the Revolution of 1911. Today, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism are the targets of the Chinese people's revolution and the greatest enemies hindering China's realization of independence, democracy, freedom, and happiness. If they are not thoroughly eradicated, a truly peaceful situation in name and reality can never be achieved. Therefore, we must relentlessly destroy the false peace offensive launched by Chiang Kai-shek and the United States. Moreover, within our people's democratic front, we must heighten our vigilance, rectify our ranks, unify our steps, and consolidate our unity to prevent the intrusion of counter-revolutionary forces. The people's democratic dictatorship should accommodate the representatives of the broadest strata of the people and must not accommodate counter-revolutionary bacteria; it should give the vast majority of the people full freedom and must not give a small number of reactionary elements the freedom to oppose the people. Therefore, we are confident that all people in the country who are truly working for the democratic revolution will surely work together to ensure that there is no room for the opposition to stand in the people's democratic camp, and no so-called middle road will be allowed to exist. With the reactionary regime on the verge of collapse, the peace offensive is becoming more and more bizarre. Chiang Kai-shek, China's No. 1 war criminal, openly made the first cry for peace in his New Year's Day broadcast. However, that was entirely out of deception. He completely shirked his historical crimes of harming the country and bringing disaster to the people, which are obvious to everyone, and shamelessly put forward such conditions: "As long as the peace talks do not harm the country's independence and integrity and are conducive to the people's recuperation, as long as the sacred constitution is not violated by me, and the democratic constitutional government is not damaged as a result, as long as the national system of the Republic of China can be ensured, the legal system of the Republic of China will not be interrupted, the army has a reliable guarantee, and the people can maintain their free way of life and the current minimum standard of living, then I personally have no other demands." With these conditions, the Chiang Kai-shek regime, headed by the four major families, can last for generations, so what else does he "demand"? Therefore, he finally emphasized that he would "deal with" the CCP "to the end" and called for "the unity of the military and the people, the unity of the whole country, and united struggle." This is Chiang Kai-shek's ultimate goal.

　　Today is the final test for the Chinese people. We believe that our disaster-ridden Chinese people will never be deceived by the reactionary conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States again. However, there are still such weaknesses in the temperament of a few people, who regard coordination as the highest virtue and appeasement as generosity, and cover up their essence of seeking temporary peace with a cloak of compassion. This is the final psychological basis for the enemy to carry out the peace offensive, and it is also the enemy's greatest support. In order to destroy the remaining enemy, this final support should also be eradicated.

　　The people's democratic revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has achieved today's achievements, which have not been easily obtained. Today, anyone who wants to seek temporary peace and let the enemy go, and thus make the revolutionary cause fall short, will become a sinner of the Chinese revolution and a sinner of the nation. But we are very happy and excited that we have finally seen Chairman Mao Zedong's recent statement on the current situation. In order to carry out the revolution to the end, in order to shatter the peace offensive, he has clearly, resolutely, meticulously, and solemnly exposed the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek-United States group and put forward the eight conditions for a truly people's democratic peace: 1. Punish war criminals; 2. Abolish the pseudo-constitution; 3. Abolish the pseudo-legal system; 4. Reorganize all reactionary troops according to democratic principles; 5.Confiscate bureaucrat capital; 6. Reform the land system; 7. Abolish traitorous treaties; 8. Convene a political consultative conference without the participation of reactionary elements, establish a democratic coalition government, and take over all powers of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and its subordinate governments at all levels. These eight conditions are a ruthless counterattack against Chiang Kai-shek's shameless demands, and we completely support them. There is no doubt that the public opinion of the people across the country is reflected here. We hope that all Chinese people, all comrades-in-arms on the democratic united front, must unite as one, take necessary actions, resolutely implement the public opinion of the people, and make these eight peace conditions quickly and fully realized.

　　Today is the era for our people to turn themselves over and transform history. We want to create a free way of life in which the people are the masters and a standard of living that is as high as possible, rather than "maintaining the current way of life and the lowest standard of living" as Chiang Kai-shek demands of us. Chiang Kai-shek wants us to always be slaves of the four major families and American imperialism, while we want to be the true masters of the People's Democratic Republic. In order to achieve this goal, the eight conditions put forward by Mr. Mao are indispensable. Let us restate it in a different tone: war criminals must be punished; the pseudo-constitution and pseudo-legal system must be abolished; all reactionary troops must be reorganized according to democratic principles; bureaucrat capital must be confiscated; the land system must be reformed; traitorous treaties must be abolished; all powers of the Nanjing reactionary government and its subordinate governments at all levels must be taken over; and the new political consultative conference to be convened and the democratic coalition government to be established must refuse the participation of reactionary elements. In a word, the people's revolution must be carried through to the end. The day the revolution is carried through to the end is the day the true peace arrives, the day the comprehensive liberation arrives. The liberated people are incredibly powerful. Look at our friendly country, the Soviet Union, which has become the strongest bastion of peace in the world in just thirty-two years since its founding. The Chinese people, more than twice as many as the Soviet Union, and with more superior geographical conditions, we dare to believe that after destroying the reactionary regime, we can build a peaceful, democratic, and free new China, a People's Democratic Republic, in a shorter period. A bright future is ahead of us, and we should work together.

　　李济琛沈钧儒等五十余民主人士抵达解放区
    声明彻底支持毛主席八项和平条件
    希望全国人民共同行动将革命进行到底
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】到达解放区的各民主党派各人民团体的代表人物及其他民主人士李济琛，沈钧儒，马叙伦，郭沫若，谭平山，彭泽民，章伯钧，李锡九，蔡廷锴，周建人，符定一，章乃器，李德全，胡愈之，沙千里，茅盾，朱学范，陈其尤，黄振声，朱蕴山，邓初民，剪伯赞，王绍鏊，吴晗，许广平，楚图南，丘哲，韩兆鹗，冯裕芳，许宝驹，田汉，洪深，侯外庐，沈兹九，宦乡，杨刚，曹孟君，刘清扬，张曼筠，施存统，孙起孟，严信民，李民欣，梅龚彬，沈志远，周颖，安娥，吴茂荪，何惧，林一元，赖亚力，孔德＠，袁震，沈强，王蕴如等五十五人，二十二日发表对时局声明，题为“我们对于时局的意见”，全文如下：
    我们现在已经先后进入解放区来了。回忆去年五月一日，中共中央号召全国，建议召开包括各民主党派、各人民团体、各民主人士的新政治协商会议，以加速推翻南京卖国独裁统治，实现人民民主联合政府。我们一致认定，这一解决国是的主张，正符合于全国人民大众的要求。用特率先通电响应，并先后进入解放区，在人民解放战争进行中，愿在中共领导下，献其绵薄，共策进行，以期中国人民民主革命之迅速成功，独立、自由、和平、幸福的新中国之早日实现。
    进入解放区后，我们首先获得的印象，便使我们充分欣慰。这里充满着民主自由的空气，蓬勃向上的精神。生产建设，发展猛进。社会秩序，有条不紊。工农商学各界，都能站在自己的岗位上努力工作，支援前线。中共党员，尤能以身作则，发扬超度自我牺牲之英勇，为民前锋，不辞劳瘁。而劳苦功高的人民解放大军，正以雷霆万钧之威力，发动迭次攻势，三月之间，先后歼灭了蒋军百余万，解放了整个的东北，和接近整个的华北与华中。军事的矛头，已经指向大江南岸了。毫无疑问，在一九四九年之内，中国是要得到全面解放的。
    在这样的情况下面，美帝国主义卵翼下的南京国民党反动集团，的确是快要土崩瓦解了。军事挣扎既已绝望，乃改变花样，企图以政治阴谋苟延残喘。早在北线蒋军开始溃败时，美帝国主义即已发动其阴谋活动，采取着双管齐下的破坏中国革命之毒计。一面，企图在革命阵营内酝酿反对派组织，希望阻止或缓和革命的步骤；一面，则嗾使南京反动集团，发动和平攻势，以争取时间，让反革命残余势力在大江以南或边远省份作最后挣扎。这是值得我们警惕的。
    我们今天要明白表示我们的信念。我们认为，革命必须贯彻到底，革命与反革命之间绝无妥协与调和之可能。辛亥以来，历次失败的惨痛教训，我们是应该牢牢记取的。在今天，帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，是中国人民革命之对象，是障碍中国实现独立、民主、自由、幸福之最大敌人，倘不加以彻底廓清，则名实相符的真正和平，绝不能实现。因此，我们对于蒋美所策动的虚伪的和平攻势，必须加以毫不容情的摧毁。而在我们人民民主阵线内，更必须提高我们的警惕，整肃我们的阵容，齐一我们的步伐，巩固我们的团结，以防止反革命势力之侵入。人民民主专政应容纳最广泛阶层人民之代表，而不能容纳反革命细菌；应使最大多数人民有充分之自由，而不能使少数反动分子有反人民之自由。由此，我们确信，全国真正为民主革命而努力的人士，必能一致努力，务使人民民主阵营之内，决无反对派立足之余地，亦决不容许有所谓中间路线之存在。反动政权在摇摇欲坠的当前，和平攻势是愈来愈离奇了。中国的第一号战犯蒋介石的元旦广播，便公开了第一次求和的哀鸣。然而，那完全是出于欺骗。他把他祸国殃民、昭昭在人耳目的历史罪状，完全推卸了，厚颜无耻地竟提出了这样的一些条件：“只要和议无损于国家的独立完整而有助于人民休养生息，只要神圣的宪法不由我而违反，民主宪政不因此而破坏，中华民国的国体能够确保，中华民国的法统不致中断，军队有确实的保障，人民能够维持其自由的生活方式与目前的最低生活水准，则我个人更无复他求。”有了这些条件，以四大家族为首的蒋朝政权尽可万世一系，还要“他求”什么呢？故他最后强调，他要与中共“周旋到底”，而呼吁着“军民一体，举国一致，团结奋斗。”这就是蒋介石的最终目的。
    今天是我们中国人民的最后考验。我们多灾多难的中国人民，我们相信，决不会再受蒋美反动阴谋的欺骗。但在少数人的气质中，也尽有这样的弱点存在，以协调为上德，以姑息为宽仁，在荀且偷安的本质之上披覆着悲天悯人的外衣。这就是敌人施行和平攻势的最后心理根据，也就是敌人的最大的奥援。我们为了摧毁残敌，这最后的奥援也是应该连根铲去的。
    人民民主革命，在中共领导之下有了今天的成就，决非轻易得来。在今天，谁如要偷安纵敌，而使革命大业功亏一篑，谁就成为中国革命的罪人，民族的罪人了。但我们很愉快而且很兴奋，我们毕竟看到了中共主席毛泽东先生最近所发表的对时局声明。为了贯彻革命到底，为了粉碎和平攻势，他明快、坚决、周密、严正地揭穿了蒋美集团的阴谋，而提出了真正的人民民主和平的八个条件：一、惩办战争罪犯；二、废除伪宪法；三、废除伪法统；四、依据民主原则改编一切反动军队；五、没收官僚资本；六、改革土地制度；七、废除卖国条约；八、召开没有反动分子参加的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，接收南京国民党反动政府及其所属各级政府的一切权力。这八项条件，正是对于蒋介石所提无耻要求的无情反击，我们是彻底支持的。毫无疑问，全国人民的公意是在这儿反映出来了。我们希望全中国人民，全民主统一战线上的战友，务须一致团结，采取必要行动，坚决执行人民的公意，而使这八项和平条件迅速地全部实现。
    今天是我们人民翻身改造历史的时代了，我们要创造一个人民做主人的自由的生活方式和尽可能地高度的生活水准，而不是如蒋介石所要求于我们的“维持目前的生活方式和最低的生活水准”。蒋介石要我们始终做四大家族和美帝国主义的奴隶，而我们则是要做人民民主共和国的真正的主人。为了达到这一目的，毛先生所提出的八项条件，正缺一不可。不妨让我们换一个语调来重述一遍，便是：战争罪犯必须惩办；伪宪法和伪法统必须废除；一切反动军队必须依据民主原则改编；官僚资本必须没收；土地制度必须改革；卖国条约必须废除；南京反动政府及其所属各级政府的一切权力必须接收；而将要召开的新政治协商会议和将要成立的民主联合政府也必须拒绝反动分子的参加。一句话归总，便是人民革命必须进行到底。革命进行到底的一天，便是真正的和平到来的一天，解放全面到来的一天。解放了的人民，力量是无比强大的。请看我们的友邦苏联吧，建国仅仅三十二年，已经成为全世界最坚强的和平堡垒了。我们中国人民多过苏联两倍以上，更加以地理上的优越条件，我们敢于相信，把反动政权摧毁以后，我们能以较短的期间建设成一个和平、民主、自由的新中国，人民民主共和国。光明的远景在我们的前面，我们应一致努力。
