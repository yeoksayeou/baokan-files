The "Advance Detachment" gained preliminary experience in enforcing discipline and policies during the garrisoning of Baoding:

	I.	Regular policy education is the foundation for implementing policies. Since the Gucheng battle in July of last year, leaders at all levels of the detachment have paid attention to the implementation of policies and discipline. Discipline was specifically checked after each battle. By the time of the Baoding South Gate battle, the brigade political commissar formally proposed: "Strive for victory in both military and political affairs." "We must win military victories, and we must also win victories in the implementation of policies and discipline." Through repeated policy and discipline education, the entire unit, especially the cadres, took a step forward in their policy awareness. Before battles, Party committees at all levels could automatically put forward specific requirements for the implementation of policies, generally eliminating the purely military viewpoint of some administrative cadres who only cared about administrative work and not about implementing policies. For example, some commanders personally gave classes to soldiers on policies and clearly recognized that they were not only implementing policies but also a part of grasping and implementing the Party's policies. This was the ideological foundation for good discipline after entering the city.

	II.	Firm and clear ideological leadership is the key to implementing policies. After accepting the task of garrisoning Baoding, the brigade committee, after research, issued a call to the entire army: "Under the guidance of protecting and building Baoding, strive to complete the garrison mission!" In particular, it was proposed: "Be prepared to endure hardship, make the broad masses of citizens understand the Party and the army's policies and the essence of serving the people through our army's actual actions, be prepared to endure cold and hunger, and resolutely oppose the erroneous view of entering the city to enjoy happiness." Just after entering the city, there were indeed many duties, many tasks, sleeping in cold rooms, and eating cold food, but because there had been sufficient ideological preparation in advance, and cadres set an example, generally speaking, no one violated discipline to buy things. However, some people also believed: "Not allowing us to spread straw on the ground shows that the leadership is being mechanical and lacks a mass perspective." The leadership pointed out: "Just after entering the city, every blade of grass moved, every piece of paper used, the broad masses of citizens are watching us with their eyes wide open. Every move of our People's Liberation Army has an impact. In order to unite the 100,000 people of Baoding and even expand the influence to the several million people of Peiping and Tianjin, this kind of 'mechanical' approach is completely necessary. This is precisely what the partial interests must submit to the whole." This firm and unwavering clear leadership direction is the main key to the implementation of discipline.

	III.	Specific organizational preparations are an effective measure for implementing policies. This includes two aspects of organizational preparation: one is the organization of military control committee cadres. Taking the district as a unit, a regimental cadre leads a battalion to participate in the district command post. In military actions, they are under the command of the police, and in the implementation of policies and discipline, they should respect the opinions of local cadres. Therefore, actions are unified, and both sides can exchange opinions in a timely manner, so that the military control tasks can be smoothly implemented. The other aspect is the organization of the troops themselves for maintaining and checking discipline. The military training team formed a disciplinary inspection brigade, with a section chief from the military and political teams serving as the captain and political commissar respectively. Each battalion also universally formed a discipline inspection group to check the discipline of the battalion in a timely manner. In addition, according to past experience, logistics personnel receive less education, engage in more independent activities, and are prone to becoming a "dead corner" for the implementation of discipline. This time, the labor team was uniformly handed over to the health department and was responsible outside the city. Some logistics personnel were organized into squads, with special personnel conducting education and control. The troops entering the city cooked their own meals outside. All of these specific organizational preparations are effective measures for implementing policies and discipline.

	IV.	Give full play to the power of the Party. After the brigade committee studied the garrison mission, Party committees at all levels conducted special discussions and made written decisions. Some battalions proposed a "Four No's" movement (that is, after entering the city, do not take things, do not destroy things, do not buy things, do not pick up things), and some proposed "Five Musts and Five Must Nots." The Fifth Company branch of the "Advance Detachment" decided to strive to become a model company for discipline. When guarding materials, the troops had to be dispersed. In order to maintain discipline, they were dispersed by platoon, with the platoon leader and branch committee member responsible; when in squads, the squad leader and Party group leader were responsible. Party members in the directly subordinate units all made their own plans for abiding by and maintaining discipline. After the South Gate battle, they also conducted reviews at Party group meetings. After entering the city, Party members reported to the group leader, and the group leader reported to the branch, etc., with the implementation of discipline as the main content of the report, so that the branch could regularly and timely understand the situation and lead the troops to maintain discipline, giving full play to the power of Party committees at all levels.

	V.	Strict management and mass supervision. Experience has proven that this is still an indispensable condition for implementing policies and discipline. This time, the control over the troops at all levels was stricter. For example, after entering the city, messengers had badges, and other people traveling had to hold "exit permits," otherwise, they were not allowed to pass. Cadres at all levels were also able to strictly control the troops, and immediately stopped anyone who moved a piece of paper or a leather box. On the other hand, cadres, soldiers, Party members, non-Party members, etc. were all able to supervise each other. When some cadres were guarding materials, the higher-ups allowed them to borrow clothes and quilts at night, but in order to take care of the impact, they would rather freeze than use them. In short, anyone who violated discipline would be opposed by everyone, creating an atmosphere of maintaining discipline and ensuring the implementation of policies and discipline.

### “前进部”怎样执行城市纪律？

　　“前进部”怎样执行城市纪律？
    “前进部”在卫戍保定的过程中，执行纪律政策获得初步经验：
    一、平时的政策教育是贯彻政策的基础；该部自从去年七月固城战斗以来，各级领导上就注意了对政策纪律的贯彻。每次战斗以后，都要专门查纪律。到保定南关战斗时，旅政委即正式提出：“争取军政两胜”。“军事上要打胜仗，执行政策纪律上也要打胜仗。”经过反复的政策纪律教育，使整个部队首先是干部在政策观念上提高了一步。战斗以前，各级党委都能自动提出对执行政策的具体要求，一般的消灭了某些行政干部只管行政工作不管执行政策的单纯军事观点。如有的指挥员亲自给战士上课讲政策，并明确认识了自己不但是执行政策，而且也是掌握贯彻党的政策的一员。这是入城后执行纪律好的思想基础。
    二、坚定明确的思想领导是贯彻政策的关键。接受了卫戍保定的任务，旅委研究后，对全军提出号召：“在保护建设保定的方针下，为完成卫戍任务而努力！”特别是提出：“要准备吃苦，要使广大市民从我军的实际行动中领会我党我军的政策和为人民服务的本质，要准备挨冷受饿，坚决反对认为进城享福的错误观点。”刚入城后，果然是勤务多，工作多，睡冷屋子，吃冷饭，但因事先有了充分的思想准备，干部以身作则，一般的说并没有人犯纪律买东西。但是，也有些人认为：“有草不让铺，是领导上机械，缺乏群众观点。”领导上则指出：“刚入城后，动一个草个子，动用一张纸，广大的市民都在睁眼看着我们，我们解放军的一举一动都有影响，为了团结保市十万人民甚至扩大影响平、津几百万人民，这种‘机械’是完全必要的，这正是部分利益服从整个利益所需要的。”这种坚决不移的明确的领导方针，是纪律执行的主要关键。
    三、具体的组织准备，是贯彻政策的有效措施。这包括两方面的组织准备：一是军管会干部的组织，以区为单位，由一个团干带一个营参加区指挥所，在军事行动上受警司指挥，在贯彻政策纪律上应尊重地方干部的意见。因此行动统一，双方有意见能够及时的交换，使军管任务能够顺利的执行。另一方面，就是部队本身维护与检查纪律的组织，由军训队组成纠察大队，由司政两队的各一个科长分任队长、政委，各营还普遍组成纪律检查组，及时检查本营的纪律情况。此外，根据过去经验，勤杂人员受教育少，单独活动多，容易成为执行纪律的“死角”。这次统一把民工队交卫生处，在城外负责。有的把勤杂人员编成班，专人进行教育和掌握。进城部队在外做饭。所有这些具体的组织准备，都是贯彻政策纪律的有效措施。
    四、发挥党的力量。旅委研究了卫戍任务后，各级党委都进行了专门讨论，做出书面决定，有的营提出“四不”运动（即进城后，不要东西，不破坏东西、不买东西、不捡东西），有的提出“五要五不要”。“前进部”五连支部决定争取纪律模范连，在看管物资时，部队要分散，为了掌握纪律、便以排为单位分散，由排长和支委负责；以班为单位时，由班长和党的小组长负责。直属队党员都订出自己的遵守与维护纪律的计划。南关战斗后，又在党的小组会上进行检讨。入城后，党员对小组长、组长对支部等，都以执行纪律的情况为汇报的主要内容，使支部能经常及时的了解情况，领导部队维护纪律，发挥各级党委的威力。
    五、严格管理和群众性的监督。经验证明，这仍然是执行政策纪律不可缺少的条件。这次各级对部队的掌握较严，如入城后，通讯员有证章，其他出行的人必须持“外出证”，不然，不准通行。各级干部也能够严格的掌握部队，见到动一张纸、一个皮盒都要马上制止。另一方面，干部、战士、党员、非党员等都能够互相监督。有的干部看管物资时，上级允许其在夜间可以借用衣被，但为了照顾影响，宁冻着也没用。总之，谁犯纪律都会遭到大家的反对，造成维护纪律的风气，保证了政策纪律的贯彻。【冀中三日电】
