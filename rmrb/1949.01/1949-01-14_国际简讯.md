    ▲ TASS issued a statement on the 4th, stating that recent rumors in American and British newspapers about the Soviet Union's failure to fulfill its decision to repatriate German prisoners of war are malicious slanders. Their purpose is to cover up the fact that the British and French governments are indefinitely detaining large numbers of German prisoners of war under the guise of wage laborers, and also detaining more than 250,000 Soviet citizens who were abducted to Germany by the Hitlerites during the war and are still being held in concentration camps in the American, British, and French occupied zones of Germany and Austria. As for the repatriation of German prisoners of war from the Soviet Union, it can be announced that the vast majority of them have been repatriated.
    △ Marshal Sokolovsky, the Soviet Military Government Governor of Germany, issued an order pointing out that in 1948, the mining and power industries in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany completed their production plans ahead of schedule. It also pointed out that great achievements had been made in restoring and starting up mines and power stations. To this end, Marshal Sokolovsky issued a special order to reward the leading personnel in these enterprises and the most outstanding workers and technicians in the mining industry with bonuses.
    △ Paris newspapers reported that French postal rates, telegram fees, telephone fees, and fuel prices will rise again by 150% to 160%. According to the Queuille government's new tax decree and price increase decision, this is only the beginning of implementing a "broad tax plan." L'Humanité reported that last year, the prices of basic necessities rose by 19% to 143%, with bread rising by 46%, sugar by 35%, butter by 122%, and shoes and socks by 350%.

    ▲塔斯社于四日发表声明称：美英报纸最近关于苏联未曾履行遣送德国战俘决定的谣言，是恶意的污蔑，目的在于掩盖英法政府无限期地在工资劳动者的名目下扣留大批德国战俘，以及扣留战时被希特勒分子掳至德国而迄今仍被拘在德奥境内美英法占领区各集中营内的二十五万名以上的苏联公民。至于自苏联遣送德国战俘一事，可以宣告者，即他们之中的最大多数已被遣送回国。
    △德境苏联军政府总督索柯洛夫斯基元帅发布命令，指出在四八年间，德境苏占区的采矿和电力工业，提早完成了生产计划。同时指出：在恢复和开动矿场和电力站方面，也有很大成绩。为此，索帅特训令以奖金酬劳各该企业中的领导人员及采矿工业中最卓越的工人和技术人员。
    △巴黎各报报导：法国邮费、电报费、电话费、燃料价格等，又将上涨百分之一百五十至一百六十。按照葛义政府的新税法令和提高物价的决定，这还只是实行“广泛的税收计划”的开始。人道报称：去年，基本必需品的价格上涨了百分之十九至百分之一百四十三，其中面包上涨百分之四十六，糖百分之三十五，牛油百分之一百二十二，鞋袜百分之三百五十。
