Gaoyang Zhongzhong Printing Factory Workers
New Year Donation to Support the Front

[Jizhong News] At 1:00 PM on January 1, 1949, all employees of the Gaoyang Zhongzhong Dyeing and Printing Factory held a tea party to celebrate the New Year and to express their sympathy to the soldiers who were bravely fighting the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops in the freezing weather. Workers enthusiastically donated money to support the front lines. Comrade Liu Jixian stood up and said, "We can work here peacefully because of the People's Liberation Army. If it weren't for the army protecting us, the factory wouldn't be safe. Therefore, we should support the front lines." He pledged 15,000 Jizhong currency. Then Huang Mao, who watches the boiler, pledged 10,000, and Master Feng from the dyeing workshop pledged 3,000... Tian Shuangcai, a transport worker who had just returned, pledged 10,000, female worker Xiao Rui pledged 5,000, and even Lian Yuan, a young apprentice boiler worker, pledged 5,000. The total amount was 1,094,500 Jizhong currency. Everyone was extremely enthusiastic, and the meeting did not end until late at night.

　　高阳中中印花厂职工
  　新年献金支前
    【冀中讯】一九四九年一月一日下午一点钟，高阳中中染轧印花工厂全体职工，举行茶话会，庆祝新年，并慰问在冰天雪地中，千辛万苦与蒋傅匪军英勇作战的将士们，工友们热烈献金支援前线。刘继贤同志起立讲话说：“我们在这里安稳工作，都是解放军给我们的，要不是军队保卫我们，工厂也不能平安。因此我们应支援前线。”他报冀钞一万五千，接着看锅炉黄毛报一万，染房冯师傅三千………刚回来的运输员田双财同志报一万，女工小瑞报五千，锅炉徒工连元小鬼也报了五千。共合冀钞一百零九万四千五百元。大家热情极高，深夜始散会。
