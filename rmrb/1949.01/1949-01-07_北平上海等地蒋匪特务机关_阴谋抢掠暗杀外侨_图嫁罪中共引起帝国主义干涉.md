Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: It is reliably learned that Kuomintang special agent organs in several major cities are plotting to impersonate Communists to carry out robbery and assassination when the Kuomintang troops defending the city are defeated. A certain inspector general of the Beiping Police Bureau has organized several hundred Kuomintang secret agents, preparing to impersonate Communists to launch looting when the Beiping Kuomintang troops are defeated and the People's Liberation Army has not yet entered the city. The Shanghai Kuomintang special agent organs are preparing to destroy several British and American factories in the name of impersonating Communists, and assassinate several British and American expatriates, in order to arouse the antipathy of ordinary expatriates and ordinary foreigners towards the Chinese People's Liberation War, and give foreign imperialist elements an excuse to carry out armed intervention.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: The Kuomintang reactionaries are carrying out large-scale arrests in Nanjing and other cities. It is reported that the arrests in Nanjing began in the last ten days of December last year. Within a few days, more than 2,000 people were arrested in Nanjing and its nearby villages and towns, including workers, peasants, hawkers, and several primary school teachers and intellectuals. On the 20th of last month, the Nanjing Central Daily News published an editorial written by war criminal Tao Xisheng, saying that there were more than 20,000 "Communist suspects" in Nanjing, and advocated imitating Yan Xishan's so-called Taiyuan anti-espionage law to carry out bloody suppression of the people of Nanjing. This editorial was the signal for this atrocity. In Taiyuan, more than 8,000 people were arrested by the Yan bandit within a week last month, of whom 3,000 were shot. Since the end of November last year, more than 5,000 people in Tianjin and Beiping have been arrested by the Fu bandit Zuoyi, and their whereabouts are still unknown. The Shanghai Kuomintang special agent organs arrested more than 200 staff members of various organs and other citizens on December 16th of last year alone.

　　北平上海等地蒋匪特务机关
  　阴谋抢掠暗杀外侨
    图嫁罪中共引起帝国主义干涉
    【新华社陕北五日电】据确悉：若干大城市中的国民党特务机关正在阴谋计划在守城的国民党军失败时冒充共产党实行抢劫与暗杀。北平警察局某督察长已组织了几百个军统局特务分子，准备在北平国民党军失败而解放军尚未进城时冒充共产党发动抢掠。上海国民党特务机关准备假冒共产党之名破坏若干英美工厂，暗杀若干英美侨民，以便引起一般外侨和一般外国人民对于中国人民解放战争的恶感，并给予外国帝国主义分子以实行武装干涉的借口。
    【新华社陕北五日电】国民党反动集团在南京及其他城市正实行大规模的逮捕。据悉，南京的逮捕开始于去年十二月下旬数日之内，在南京及其近郊村镇被逮捕者即达二千多人，包括工人、农民、小贩及若干小学教员与知识分子。上月二十日南京中央日报发表战犯陶希圣所写的社论，说南京“共党嫌疑分子”有两万以上，主张仿效阎匪锡山的所谓太原防谍法，对南京人民进行血腥镇压。这篇社论就是这次暴行的信号。太原在上月一周之内遭阎匪逮捕者达八千多人，其中三千人被枪杀。自去年十一月底起，天津和北平人民被傅匪作义捕去者五千余人，至今下落不明。上海国民党特务机关在去年十二月十六日一天内逮捕了各机关职员及其他市民二百余人。
