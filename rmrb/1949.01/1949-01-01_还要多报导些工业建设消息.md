To the Editor:

The North China District's policy emphasizes equal importance to both industry and agriculture in leadership. Our Party newspaper tends to focus on agricultural reports, with very little material on industrial construction. In this current "nascent stage of revolutionary industry," it is even more necessary to rely on the Party newspaper to spread the "new seeds" of industrial development. Such as industrial plans, worker movements, experience summaries, and inventions, even if they are small and incremental, as long as they are beneficial to industrial development, they should be published as much as possible. Taking this opportunity to solicit readers' opinions, I am writing this suggestion for your reference.

　　还要多报导些工业建设消息
    编辑同志：
    华北区施政方针中，提到了工业农业并重的领导方式。我们的党报是偏重于农业报导方面，对于工业建设的材料则很少见到。处在目前这个“革命工业的雏形发展时期”，更必须依靠党报来传播有关工业发展的“新生的种子”。如工业计划，职工运动，经验总结，及创造发明等，那怕是一点一滴，只要是对发展工业有利的，应尽量刊载。值此征求读者意见的机会，写上这一个意见以供参考。
