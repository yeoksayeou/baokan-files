Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 27th: Radio Free Greece broadcasted that the Greek Provisional Democratic Government has protested to the UN Security Council, UN Secretary-General Lie, all UN member governments, all democratic countries in the world, the American people, and all civilized humanity against American interference in Greek internal affairs. The protest stated in brief: "The American government is organizing and directing the royalist fascist army in Greece in a war against the Greek people. The United States has not only supplied the royalist fascists with 800,000 tons of military supplies, not only are there hundreds of American officers led by Vlitos commanding the royalist fascist army and directing them in combat, not only has U.S. Ambassador Grady recently been appointed as a member of the Athens Military Committee, but the democratic army also has some evidence proving that American officers are directly participating in the war. At 11:00 AM on January 21, 1949, the democratic army shot down a plane that was strafing and bombing the peaceful residents of the democratic army-liberated city of Karpenisi; the plane was piloted by American Major Kirdino, whose badge number was AO36629-47. The American major has died. Personnel from the Democratic Army headquarters in Karpenisi have seized the American major's military identification, photographed his body, and obtained a death certificate signed by residents of Karpenisi. Therefore, the Greek Provisional Democratic Government has now obtained irrefutable evidence proving that the United States is directly participating in the war against the Greek people."

　　美帝直接参加希腊内战希腊民主政府提出抗议
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】自由希腊电台广播：希腊临时民主政府已向联合国安理会、联合国秘书长莱氏、联合国一切会员国政府、全世界一切民主国家、美国人民及全体文明人类抗议美国干涉希腊内政。该抗议略称：“美国政府正在希腊组织着和指挥着保皇法西斯军进行反对希腊人民的战争。美国不仅已供给保皇法西斯八十万吨军需品，不仅有数以百计的美国军官在佛立特率领下统率保皇法西斯陆军并指挥他们作战，不仅美大使格拉第于最近被任命为雅典军事委员会委员，而且民主军也有若干证据证明美国军官直接参加战争。一九四九年一月廿一日十一时，民主军击落一架以机枪扫射并轰炸民主军所解放的卡彭尼西城和平居民的飞机，该飞机由美国基尔迪诺少校驾驶，其证章号数为ＡＯ三六六二九——四七。该美国少校业已身死，民主军总部驻卡彭尼西城司令部人员已缴获了该美国少校的军籍证，并且已将其尸体拍照，由卡彭尼西居民作证，写下死亡证明书。因此，希腊临时民主政府现已获得无可争辩的证据，证明美国直接参加反希腊人民的战争。”
