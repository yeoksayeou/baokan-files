　　Shijiazhuang Investigates Private Bank Deposits
  　Many Deposits from Public Institutions
  　People's Bank to Handle Separately
    [Our Newspaper] According to the meeting of private banks convened by the Shijiazhuang Industry and Commerce Bureau on December 21 regarding deposits and loans, and the People's Bank of Shijiazhuang branch's review of deposits in seventeen private banks in the city on the 25th and 26th of last month, it was discovered that the amount of deposits from public enterprises, government agencies, cooperatives, cadres, and soldiers in private banks was very large. There were a total of 73 public enterprise depositors, such as the Changzhi Enterprise Department Trade Union, Linfeng Freight Forwarding, Xingtai Tannery (all deposited with Rongxing Bank), North China Industrial Company, Shijiazhuang Foreign Affairs Office, New China Freight Forwarding, the Opium Prohibition Bureau, etc. There were 51 private depositors including cadres and soldiers, such as Li Nongyun of Xinhua Bookstore, Guo Zaisheng of the Ministry of Communications, Li Zizhi and Liu Shuxian of the Opium Prohibition Bureau, and Li Huabin of the North China Ministry of Communications, etc. The total amount of these two items was over 890 million yuan. After these deposits were discovered, they were immediately frozen in accordance with government decrees, and the funds were all transferred to the state bank for processing. After research by relevant leading organs, it was decided that the depositing institutions and individuals would be treated leniently, and in addition to criticism, all deposits would be returned. Among the frozen deposits, some public enterprises were still not convinced, and some went to the Industry and Commerce Bureau demanding the money back. The North China Industrial Company (affiliated with the Military Region) had over 160 million yuan of Jicha [Hebei-Chahar-Rehe currency] deposited in Tongxing Bank, and withdrew it casually after it was frozen. New China Freight Forwarding had over 100 million yuan of Jicha deposited in Yuzhong Bank, and after it was frozen, it deposited another one million yuan in Yuzhong Bank. The government issued a circular as early as the beginning of August last year stipulating that all deposits and loans of public enterprises should be deposited in state banks; all funds previously deposited in private banks should be cleared and recovered within one month. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government also issued similar instructions. However, many public enterprises did not comply with government decrees, only caring about the interests of their own "small public entities" and seeking more interest. After the investigation, they did not thoroughly examine and reflect on themselves, but showed displeasure, which is very inappropriate. Especially at a time when grain prices in the city are fluctuating and the government is making great efforts to stabilize them, some unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to speculate and stir up trouble. Depositing public funds in private banks has invisibly increased the capital for speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants in the market (however, it is not to say that the bank capital is speculative capital), affecting the lives of workers and citizens. Therefore, the measures taken by the Shijiazhuang Industry and Commerce Bureau and the People's Bank branch are completely correct. Responsible comrades of the directly subordinate superiors of each depositing public enterprise and individual should urge them to examine and reflect on this departmentalism and anarchism, lack of organization and discipline, and ensure that there will be no more violations of government decrees in the future.
    In addition, during the inspection, it was discovered that some private banks did not comply with the operating regulations of the banking industry and exceeded their business scope. For example, Huafeng Bank invested 5 million yuan of Jicha in Huaxing Bank and 4 million yuan in Zhenghua Bank. Its own operating funds were only 6 million yuan, while its investment exceeded its capital. Another example is Yuhua Bank, which is a branch of Handan. The registered capital of the head office is 30 million yuan, but Yuhua Bank in Shijiazhuang has no other shareholders, but registered 15 million yuan of capital, which is very unfavorable for management. More seriously, the commercial bank exceeded its business scope and hoarded more than 500 jin of white oil, seventy or eighty bags of flour, and a total of 5,000 jin of rice and wheat (the Industry and Commerce Bureau has ordered it to be sold to supply the market). There are also situations where the cash inventory does not match. The Shijiazhuang branch of the People's Bank is currently studying how to handle these cases and will impose separate punishments.

　　石市检查私人银号存款
  　公营机关存款甚多
  　人民银行将分别给以处理
    【本报讯】根据石家庄市工商局十二月二十一日召开的私人银号关于存放款会议情况，及人民银行石家庄分行于上月二十五、六日对该市十七家私人银号存款复查的结果，发现公营企业、机关、合作社、干部、军人等在私人银号存款数目是很大的。公营企业存款共七十三户，如长治企业部总工会、林风货栈、邢台制革厂（以上存到荣兴银号）华北实业公司、石市交际处、新中国货栈、禁烟局等等。干部、军人等私人存款者共五十一人。如新华书店之李农云、交通部之郭再生、禁烟局之李子直、刘恕贤、华北交通部之李华彬等等。两项合计共存款八亿九千余万元。这些存款经查出后，即根据政府法令马上予以冻结，款子全部拨国家银行等候处理。现经有关领导机关研究结果，对存款机关、私人一律从轻处理，除给以批评外，存款一律发还。在冻结存款当中，有的公营企业仍不服气，有的到工商局硬要款子，华北实业公司（属大军区）存同兴银号之冀钞一亿六千多万元，冻结后又随便支走。新中国货栈存裕众银号冀钞一亿多元，经冻结后，又存到裕众银号一百万元。按政府早于去年八月初曾有通令：规定公营企业存放款时，一律存放国家银行；过去存放私人银号之款项，一律限一个月内清理收回。石市市委及市政府也曾发出此类指示。而好多公营企业竟不遵守政府法令，只顾自己“小公家”的利益，多得一点利息。经查出后，尚不彻底检查反省自己，而表现不高兴，这是非常不应该的。尤其是目前市内粮价波动，政府正大力平抑，而部分奸商正趁机投机取巧，兴风作浪。把公家的款子存到私人银号里，无形中增加了奸商在市场投机活动的资本（然而不是说银号资本即是投机资本），影响工人、市民生活。因此，石市工商局，银行分行这种措施是完全正确的。各存款公营企业及个人直属上级负责同志，应对这种本位主义和无政府、无组织、无纪律现象督促其检查反省，并保证以后不再有违反政府法令的事情。
    另外在检查当中，发现有些私人银号不遵守银钱业经营规章，超出业务范围的现象。如华丰银号投资到华兴银号冀钞五百万元，又投到正华银号四百万元，自己经营资金才六百万元，而投资超过资本。又如裕华银号，系邯郸分此，总号登记资金三千万元，而裕华银号在石庄别无股东，而登记一千五百万元资金，这很不利于管理。更严重的是商业银号超出业务范围，而囤积白油五百多斤，面粉七、八十袋，米麦共五千斤（工商局已令其出售供应市场）。还有的现金库存款不对头等情。石庄人民银行分行，刻正研究办理，分别给以处分。（柏青）
