Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch:

　　Since a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered the city's transportation hub to fight, under the leadership of the unit's Party committee, it has performed very well in earnestly implementing urban policies and entry discipline, and cherishing the main force. It has successfully completed its garrison mission. When Huailai was liberated, the unit was responsible for the garrison and guard duties of Huailai. When the enemy had just retreated, material conditions were inconvenient. In order to take care of the interests of the people in the new district, the unit lived an extraordinarily hard life, and was often hungry for several days. In addition, there were fewer troops entering the city, and they were responsible for tasks such as martial law and checking household registrations, with excessive duties. Comrades from the cooking squad and heavy machine gun squad also took on guard duties. Under these circumstances, the officers and soldiers completed their tasks with unwavering dedication. The materials in the eleven warehouses they guarded were intact; the desks and chairs in the former enemy agencies they guarded were rarely disturbed. When the weather was very cold, everyone had no quilts and only some overcoats. With the permission of the Military Control Commission, they dismantled the wood from the original enemy bunkers outside the city to burn the kangs (heated brick beds). When a certain main force unit of our Northeast Army moved west and arrived in Huailai City in the middle of the night, a detachment of the unit immediately got up and quickly gave up the warm kangs. Some comrades of the main force also refused to let them sleep on the ground, and everyone slept together on the warm kang, intertwined. In addition to vacating the warm kangs, the comrades in the cooking squad of the Third Detachment also proactively lent them firewood and rice, carried water, and let them cook first, demonstrating a high degree of class friendship. When the deputy political commissar of the unit talked about the garrison situation in Huailai, he said: "There is one thing that our troops' discipline has not done well. Because the departure order was received late, we set off before dawn without cleaning the landlord's courtyard. This is a big shortcoming!"
    After the unit was transferred to Zhangjiakou, it made preparations in terms of ideology and organization in advance, and conducted ten days of policy and discipline education. Every squad of the Ninth Company of the Third Detachment copied a copy of the entry discipline manual, and was able to recite and explain it. The First Detachment conducted warehouse guarding exercises. The unit's Party committee specially discussed the entry work, and convened meetings of cadres above the platoon level to stipulate military discipline, etiquette, leave application and other systems. The Party held a general mobilization meeting within the branches, calling for ensuring the realization of the Party's urban policies and discipline. Therefore, after the unit entered Zhangjiakou, it further improved in terms of observing policies and discipline, and guarding materials. On the first night of entering the city, the unit's directly affiliated organs, the First and Third Detachments, the health team, the special service company and other units discovered enemy warehouses and materials. However, they all reported to the Military Control Commission level by level from the squad to the regiment, and strictly guarded them. When the First Detachment was guarding a leather shoe warehouse, the headquarters sent a car to pick them up, but the guard did not allow them to take them away because they did not have formal procedures. When the unit's leader inspected the warehouse, he touched the seal with his hand, and the guard said: "Don't touch it, I won't be able to explain it if you break it!" Because the unit guarded it carefully, very few materials were lost. Secondly, the officers and soldiers unanimously carried forward the spirit of hard struggle. Some leaders' quilts were extremely thin and small, and all the soldiers only had hundreds of overcoats. Except for the Ninety quilts in the Ninth Company, most of the comrades slept on cold kangs. Even under such circumstances, when the First Squad of the Eighth Company guarded the hospital, the hospital gave them a coat and leather shoes, but they refused to accept them. In addition, the unit strictly and conscientiously abided by mass discipline. Except that the squad leader of the Third Squad of the Eighth Company damaged a light bulb of the landlord and compensated for it at the original price, it did not harm the interests of the masses in the slightest. Comrade Xi Shui, the deputy squad leader of the Second Squad of the Eighth Company of the Third Detachment, said: "We exchanged the city with blood and flesh, don't ruin the discipline!" Comrade Liu Cun, the deputy squad leader of the Second Squad, said: "What do our revolutionary troops rely on if not on policies and discipline?" The landlord of the Third Squad of the Eighth Company said: "There is no place in the world to find a team as good as you!" The reason why the unit has made such great progress in implementing policies and discipline is not only because it has carried out policy and discipline education, launched a struggle against anarchy and indiscipline, and rectified discipline in accordance with the order of the Central Military Commission and the military and political training order to improve the concept of discipline, but also because the unit's Party committee took the lead in leadership, strictly grasped and patiently carried out persuasive education, which is also a very important factor.

### 解放军某部　卫戍张垣纪律严明

　　解放军某部
  　卫戍张垣纪律严明
    【新华社张垣电】人民解放军某部，自进入城市交通要道作战以来，在该部党委领导下，在切实贯彻城市政策和入城纪律，爱护主力部队等方面均甚良好。胜利完成了卫戍任务。怀来解放时，某部担任怀来警戒卫戍任务，在敌人刚撤退时，物资条件不方便，该部为照顾新区群众利益，生活异常艰苦，曾好几天吃不饱饭。另外，进城的部队较少，担任戒严清查户口等任务，勤务过多，伙夫班、重机枪班等同志也担任警卫工作。在此种情况下，官兵一致任劳任怨地完成了任务。在所看守的十一个仓库中，物资完整无缺；在所看守的原敌人机关中，桌凳等物很少紊乱。在天气很冷的时候，大家无被子仅有部分大衣，经军管委员会允许，才到城外拆毁了原敌人碉堡的木材来烧炕。东北我军主力某部西移，半夜到达怀来城，该部一支队马上起床，迅速地把热炕让出来。有的主力军同志也不肯让他们睡到地下，大家就在热炕上一起交叉着睡。三支队除腾暖炕外，伙夫同志并主动借给他们柴米，挑水，并让给他们先做饭，发扬了高度的阶级友爱。该部副政委在谈到怀来驻军情况时说：“我们部队纪律有一点没作好，由于接到出发命令较迟，天未亮即出发，没有给房东打扫房院，真是一个大缺点！”
    该部在转驻张市后，事先在思想上组织上均作了准备工作，进行过十天政策纪律教育。三支队九连每班都把入城纪律手册抄过一份，作到了会背会解释。一支队进行了看管仓库演习，该部党委专门讨论了入城工作，召开了排以上干部会，规定了军风纪、礼节、请假等制度。党内召开了支部动员大会，号召保证实现党的城市政策和纪律。因此该部进入张市后，在遵守政策纪律，看管物资方面更提高了一步。第一天夜晚进城，该部直属机关、一、三支队、卫生队、特务连等单位，发现了敌人的仓库和物资。但均由班到团逐级报告军管会，并严密看管。一支队看守皮鞋仓库时，司令部派汽车来取，但未带正式手续，卫兵便不让取走。当该部首长检查仓库时，用手摸了一下封条，卫兵说：“你可别动，弄坏了我可没法交待！”由于该部认真看管，物资极少损失。其次，官兵一致发扬了艰苦奋斗的作风，有些首长的被子极薄又小，全体战士仅有数百件大衣，除九连有九十床棉被外，绝大多数同志都在冷炕上睡。即在这样的情况下，八连一班守卫医院时，医院送给他们一部大衣和皮鞋，他们则拒绝接受。此外该部严格认真遵守群众纪律，除三支八连三班长损坏房东一电泡已照价赔偿外，没有损害群众丝毫利益。三支八连二班副班长希水同志说：“咱们用血肉换来的城市，别把纪律搞坏了呀！”二班副班长刘村同志说：“咱们革命军队不靠政策纪律，靠什么呢？”八连三班房东说：“天下再也没有地方找到你们这样好的队伍了！”该部在执行政策纪律方面，所以有这样大的进步，除了因为进行了政策纪律教育，开展了反对无政府无纪律的斗争，并根据中央军委命令及军政训令进行了整顿纪律提高了纪律观念外该部党委在领导上的以身作则，严格掌握耐心的进行说服教育，也是个很重要的因素。
