[Taiyue Electric] Yangcheng County, based on the Administrative Office's requirements for this year's major production and the county's own situation, has formulated a concrete plan. The county has 610,000 mu of land, with the current average yield being about 80% of pre-war levels. The plan is to increase coarse grain production by 1.25 dou per mu this year, requiring a total increase of 60,000 shi of coarse grain for the entire county. To achieve this goal, a detailed plan for winter fertilizer accumulation, agricultural tool repair, and livestock increases was made at the county production conference last November. In the past month or so, significant results have been achieved in fertilizer accumulation. According to statistics from 17 administrative villages in the Sixth District, by the time of the meeting, 39,616 piles of earth had been dug up for composting and fumigation alone. Including pen manure and various miscellaneous manures, sufficient fertilizer has been secured for 60% of the 43,000+ mu of spring land in the district. Many villages in the Fourth District have begun delivering manure, with the entire district having dug out more than 4,200 dan of thatch manure. Some villages have even exceeded their original plans. For example, Sihou Village originally planned to carry out enough manure for 800 mu of grain land before the lunar new year, but they have already carried out enough for 870 mu. Seven villages in the Second District, including Hongshang, Houhe, and Yongshan, have also prepared 40% of their total fertilizer needs. The First District, due to its proximity to the city's main road, has many people collecting and buying manure. For example, Nanqin Village, having suffered from a lack of manure in the past, started early this winter and bought more than 91,000 jin of various manures. Villages such as Yaotou, Houzeyao, and Yingmiao are also applying top dressing to wheat fields to increase yields. For example, the 29 households in Yaotou have already irrigated their wheat fields with 1,300 dan of thatch manure, with Rongjun Yu Dahai applying 60 dan to just one mu of land. During this fertilizer accumulation drive, many village cadres took the lead in mobilizing the masses. For example, Zhang Chenglai, the chairman of the Zhuangtou Farmers' Association, led the masses in filling 40 thatch pits, and he himself got up early and worked late sweeping the streets to collect manure, accumulating more than 10,000 jin of manure, which motivated the entire village. Secondly, many places have increased their livestock. Villages such as Xiling Lianhuashan have established breeding stations, and the county government plans to provide loans to support and promote large-scale livestock breeding.

　　In terms of agricultural tool manufacturing, the county has established an agricultural tool factory, and two iron furnaces have already started operation, preparing to produce 2,000 dan of manure buckets, 100 seed drills, and 200 plows and harrows before spring. Villages such as Gulong, Sihou, and Baijian have also organized 38 carpenters to manufacture agricultural tools. However, in the leadership of winter production, the following issues still need to be resolved in order to further advance winter production: (1) Educating village cadres to strengthen leadership and overcome the laissez-faire phenomenon of some villages where production lacks leadership. For example, the cadres of Zhongzhai Village said, "We'll wait a few days for the party rectification, and then we'll talk about it!" This is an ideological obstacle to leading winter production and must be resolved well. (2) Continuing to publicize policies to overcome the concerns of the masses, and especially to correct the phenomenon in some mutual aid groups where no compensation is made for damage to agricultural tools. For example, Xi Ling's Pan Jiujiu said, "I'm afraid that if I buy furniture and everyone uses it badly, no one will take responsibility. I'm not planning to buy any more. They say that all farmers are one family, but we really can't afford to be one family." This is an obstacle to developing production and should be addressed.

　　阳城农民大力积肥
  　全县拟增粗粮六万石
    【太岳电】阳城县根据行政公署关于今年大生产的要求和本县情况，作出了具体计划。全县六十一万亩土地，目前平均产量约为抗战以前的八成，计划每亩今年要增加粗粮一斗二升五合，全县要求增产粗粮六万石。为了达到这个目的，在去年十一月间全县生产会上，对冬季积肥、修制农具、增添牲口等项工作，都作了详细的计划。一个多月来，在积肥方面已得了显著成绩。据六区十七个行政村的统计，至开会时止，单刨圪堆熏粪一项，已压了三万九千六百一十六堆。连同圈粪及各样杂粪，全区四万三千多亩春地，十分之六的地已有了足够的肥料。四区不少村开始送粪，全区已挖出茅粪四千二百多担，有的村还超过了原来的计划。如四侯村原计划旧历年前担出八百亩谷地的粪，现已担出了八百七十亩。二区洪上、后河、永善等七个村，也已准备好全部肥料的十分之四。一区因靠近城关大道，拾粪、买粪的人很多，如南芹村过去吃了粪少的亏，今冬早下手，买进了各种粪九万一千多斤。窑头、后则腰、应庙等村，为了增加产量，还给麦地上追肥。如窑头廿九户，已给麦地浇了一千三百担茅粪，荣军于大海一亩地就上了六十担。这次积肥，很多村干部带头推动了群众。如庄头农会主任张程徕，领导群众灌了四十个茅坑，他自己又起早搭黑打扫街道拾粪，积下一万多斤粪，推动了全村。其次不少地方已增加了牲口，西岭连花山等村已建立起配种所，县政府准备贷款扶植，提倡大量繁殖牲口。
    在制造农具方面，县里成立了农具制造厂，并有两盘铁炉已开工，准备在春前要造出粪桶两千担，耧一百张，犁耙二百付。固隆、四侯、白涧等村，也组织木工三十八人进行农具的制造。但在冬季生产的领导上，今后还须解决以下问题，才能使冬季生产前进一步：（一）教育村干部加强领导，克服某些村生产无领导的自流现象。如中寨村干部说：“等几天就整党呀，整下来再说吧！”这是领导冬季生产的思想障碍，须要很好解决。（二）宣传政策继续克服群众顾虑，特别要纠正某些互助伙使农具坏了不赔的现象。如西岭潘九久说：“怕置上家具大家财使坏了没人管，我不准备再置了。说是天下农民是一家，咱实在一家不起了。”这是发展生产的一个障碍，应注意解决。
