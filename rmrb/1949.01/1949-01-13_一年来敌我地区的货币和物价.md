　　Currency and Prices in Enemy and Our Areas Over the Past Year

　　In the past year, the Chinese people have not only achieved unprecedented great victories over the Kuomintang reactionaries militarily, but also on the economic front. This can be seen from the changes in currency and prices in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas over the past year.

　　In the past year, the Kuomintang reactionaries, along with their serious military bankruptcy, have also been completely bankrupt in finance and economy. The price increase in the Kuomintang-controlled areas reached sixteen and a half times the previous year, and last year even created an unprecedented record. Prices rose faster and faster, reaching fifty-eight times by mid-August. Under these severe circumstances, in order to try to save the collapse of the puppet legal tender, the Kuomintang reactionaries had to announce the so-called "currency reform" on August 19, issuing puppet gold yuan notes to replace the puppet legal tender, with one puppet gold yuan note exchanged for three million old legal tender, and stipulating that each puppet gold yuan note contained 0.22217 grams of pure gold. These puppet gold yuan notes could not be exchanged for gold and silver; on the contrary, they forced the people to hand over all their gold and silver to the Kuomintang in exchange for puppet gold yuan notes. At the same time, even more drastic currency inflation was implemented, increasing the currency issuance from 2 billion gold yuan notes (6 quadrillion legal tender) to 20 billion yuan at once, an increase of ten times compared to "August 19"! While implementing currency inflation, the Kuomintang government ordered a freeze on prices, prohibiting them from exceeding the "August 19" level. However, the development of facts was contrary to the wishes of the reactionaries. Shortly after the puppet gold yuan notes were issued, they caused unprecedented chaos in the markets of major cities. Goods fled, black market prices rose five to ten times, and panic buying followed. By the end of October, Chiang Kai-shek had to admit the failure of currency reform and canceled the order to freeze prices. As a result, prices became a "wild horse" galloping upwards. On November 11 last year, he promulgated the "Revised Measures for Issuing Gold Yuan Notes" and the "Revised Measures for Handling Gold, Silver and Foreign Currencies," announcing a depreciation of four-fifths of the gold yuan notes and canceling the issuance limit in order to implement more drastic currency inflation. But to deceive the people, they were allowed to use the new exchange rate to exchange gold and silver with twice the gold yuan notes (half deposit and half exchange). In the past, people were forced to exchange one tael of gold for 200 gold yuan notes, or one silver dollar for two gold yuan notes. Now they were allowed to exchange 2,000 gold yuan notes for one tael of gold, or 20 gold yuan notes for one silver dollar. Even so, people still crowded to exchange gold and silver. On December 23, in front of major banks in Shanghai, 100,000 people crowded to withdraw money, crushing seven to death and injuring more than 100. The bandit executive Yuan immediately announced a "suspension of deposit withdrawals" under the pretext of bringing this fraud to a close.

　　In short, in 1948, the Kuomintang reactionaries played many tricks in finance and currency, but the result was not only complete bankruptcy, but also accelerated the overall collapse of their finance and economy. Before "August 19," prices in Shanghai had already risen 58 times. After "August 19," they rose another 20 to 30 times. If the price in December 1948 is compared with December 1947, it rose a total of 1,460 times, equivalent to 88 times the rate of increase in the same period last year. If calculated based on the US dollar price in Shanghai, the price in December last year (120 puppet gold yuan notes bought one US dollar on the black market, equivalent to 360 million puppet legal tender) increased to 3,000 times the price in January last year (120,000 puppet legal tender equaled one US dollar).

　　As for the number of puppet gold yuan notes issued, according to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 2nd, "The conservative estimate of the amount of gold yuan issued today is 8 billion." If 3 million puppet legal tender is converted into one puppet gold yuan note, it is equivalent to 240 quadrillion puppet legal tender, which is 40 times the total amount of 6 quadrillion puppet legal tender announced by Chiang Kai-shek during the currency reform. Compared with the total amount of 84 trillion puppet legal tender announced by the Kuomintang at the end of 1947, it has inflated 285 times in one year. Such malignant currency inflation and soaring prices are not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also rare in world history.

　　In contrast to the soaring prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the currency and prices in our liberated areas have been relatively stable over the past year. Last December, compared with December of the previous year, prices in our liberated areas rose about three times in the North China and East China regions, and less than one time in the Northwest region. This is incomparable to the 1,460-fold increase in the Kuomintang reactionary-controlled areas. In recent months, prices in the North China liberated areas have fluctuated slightly, and the prices of various goods have generally increased by about 50%. This is mainly due to the large-scale Huaihai Campaign and Pingjin Campaign that are underway, and the supply of troops is quite large, which affects the temporary imbalance of supply and demand in some local areas. In addition, the speculation and manipulation of a few merchants and the temporary loss of normalcy in market transactions have caused temporary price fluctuations around the battlefield, gradually affecting other areas. However, with the improvement of material supply and the victorious conclusion of the campaign, prices will return to a stable state.

　　In terms of the monetary system, our liberated areas have initially completed the unification work in the past year. During the Anti-Japanese War, our liberated areas were in a severe state of division and blockade by the enemy, and we had to adopt the policy of regional issuance and regional circulation in the monetary system. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, as the internal regions of each liberated area gradually became connected, and economic exchanges became increasingly close, the work of sorting out and unifying the currency of the area was gradually carried out. For example, the Central China area used Central China currency to unify five or six local currencies such as Yancheng, Jianghuai, Huainan, Huaibei, and Jiangnan. The Shandong area announced the unified circulation of Beihai currency issued in various districts throughout the province. Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu also unified various local currencies within their own regions. However, before the entire unification work was completed, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war, and some areas of the liberated areas were occupied by the enemy, causing this unification work to be suspended.

　　In the second half of 1947, after the People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive, the liberated areas have been completely consolidated over the past year with the victorious progress of the People's Liberation War, and have gradually become a whole, and the exchange of materials in various places has become increasingly developed. Under these circumstances, in order to meet the needs of economic development, we have carried out currency unification work in the three major liberated areas of North China, East China, and Northwest in the past year. In January last year, the issuance of currency by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Bank was first stopped in the Northwest Liberated Area, making the Northwest Farmers Bank currency the unified currency of the Northwest Liberated Area. Then, in April, the Jinan currency of the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region currency of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region were mutually circulated at a fixed exchange rate. By October, the Beihai currency of Shandong and the two currencies of North China, and the Agricultural currency of Northwest and the two currencies of North China, were successively fixed at exchange rates and mutually circulated. In November, the Beihai currency and the Central China currency were also announced to be of equal value. At this point, the first step of our currency unification work has been largely completed. Then, the governments of the North China, Shandong, and Northwest liberated areas consulted and decided to merge the North China Bank, the Beihai Bank, and the Northwest Farmers Bank into the People's Bank of China, and on December 1, the People's Bank began to issue new currency as the unified currency of the three major liberated areas.

　　From the simple description of the above currency unification work, it is not difficult for us to understand that the reason why we have been able to carry out such a great currency unification work in such a short period of time is due to the victory of the war and our compliance with the will of the people in the liberated areas and the requirements of economic development. On the other hand, it also proves that our liberated areas have laid a solid economic foundation and have strong material strength to support the smooth progress of currency unification work.

　　To this day, if there is no above-mentioned currency unification work and no issuance of unified new currency, we will encounter many new difficulties. Not only will the material exchanges, trade exchanges, and supply and procurement work in the coordinated operations of the various field corps encounter great difficulties, but also in the future liberation of many large cities, the rapid elimination of Chiang Kai-shek currency, the establishment of local currency markets, the stabilization of prices and the restoration of order will be greatly hindered. For example, in the Pingjin surrounding areas, there are as many as seven or eight kinds of currencies with different currency values. Once Pingjin is liberated, if we do not have a unified new currency to quickly occupy the market, and let these seven or eight kinds of currencies enter the city together, it will cause great chaos in the market. The people will feel inconvenienced, and it will not benefit the public or private sectors. On the contrary, today we have a unified new currency, which will not only avoid some of the above-mentioned difficulties, but also further strengthen our future strength in the economic struggle against the enemy. We have full confidence that in 1949, the currency unification work in the liberated areas will establish a unified currency system throughout the country with the victory of the People's Liberation War.

　　From the above comparison of the currency and price changes in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and our liberated areas in the past year, we can see on the one hand: the currency unification work in the liberated areas and Chiang Kai-shek's "currency reform" have nothing similar. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "currency reform" aims to implement more drastic currency inflation and use it to more cruelly plunder the people. Therefore, the result of the implementation is not only soaring prices and popular resentment, but also accelerated economic collapse. Our currency unification is to make our currency system simpler and more consolidated, to facilitate material exchange, develop production, and prosper the economy. It is entirely from the interests of the people. On the other hand, it also proves that the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party will not only win a complete victory over the Kuomintang reactionaries militarily, but also their ability in economic construction far exceeds that of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

### 一年来敌我地区的货币和物价

　　一年来敌我地区的货币和物价
    过去的一年中，中国人民不但在军事上对国民党反动派得到了空前伟大的胜利，而且在经济战线上也得到了同样的胜利。这单从解放区与国民党统治区一年来的货币和物价的变化中，便可窥见一斑。
    一年来，国民党反动派随着其军事上的严重破产，在财政经济上也已完全破产。前年国民党统治区物价上涨已达到十六倍半，去年更造成了空前的纪录，物价愈涨愈快，到八月中旬就已经上涨了五十八倍。在这种严重的情况下，国民党反动派为着企图挽救伪法币的崩溃，不得不于八月十九日宣布所谓“币制改革”，发行伪金圆券以代替伪法币，伪金圆券一元兑换旧法币三百万元，并规定伪金圆券每圆含纯金零点二二二一七公分。这种伪金圆券不但不能兑换金银，相反的，还强迫人民以其全部金银，交给国民党换回伪金圆券。同时实行更剧烈的通货膨胀，将货币发行额一下子从二亿金圆券（法币六百万亿）提到二十亿元，即比“八、一九”时骤增十倍！国民党政府一面实行通货膨胀，一面下令冻结物价，不准超过“八、一九”的水平。但事实发展正与反动派的愿望相反，伪金圆券出世不久，即引起了各大城市市场空前的混乱，物资逃避，黑市价格涨了五倍至十倍，抢购风潮接踵而起。到十月底蒋匪不得不自己承认货币改革失败，取消冻结物价命令，于是物价更成“脱缰野马”狂奔而上。到去年十一月十一日，他又颁布了“修正金圆券发行办法”与“修正金银外币处理办法”，宣布金圆券贬值五分之四，并取消发行的限额，以便实行更剧烈的通货膨胀。但为欺骗人民，准许人民以新的比价，用两倍的金圆券（半存半兑）去兑换金银。过去人民被迫以一两黄金去兑换二百元金圆券，或以一个银元去兑换二元金圆券，现在准许以二千金圆券去换回一两黄金，或以二十元金圆券去换回一个银元。就是这样，人民还是拥挤着去兑换金银，到十二月二十三日上海各大银行门前挤着十万挤兑的人民，压死七人，压伤一百余人，匪政院即借口宣布“暂停存款兑现”，而把这场骗局宣告闭幕。
    总之，一九四八年国民党反动派在金融货币上，尽管演了不少的鬼把戏，但结果不但全部破产，而且更加速了其财政经济的总崩溃。在“八、一九”以前，上海物价即已上涨了五十八倍，“八、一九”以后又上涨了二三十倍，如把一九四八年十二月的物价与一九四七年十二月比较，共上涨了一千四百六十倍，等于前年同期上涨率的八十八倍，如以上海的美金价格计算，则去年十二月（黑市伪金圆一百二十元买一美元，折合伪法币三亿六千万元）比去年一月（伪法币十二万元合一美元）的价格，更上涨至三千倍。
    至于伪金圆券的发行数字，据美国合众社上海二日电称：“金圆发行额今日的保守的估计，则是八十亿。”如以伪法币三百万元折一元伪金圆券，即等于伪法币二万四千万亿，比蒋匪币改时所宣布的伪法币发行总额六百万亿，短短的一百三十天中，即膨胀至四十倍，如与一九四七年底国民党所宣布的伪法币发行总额八十四万亿对比，则一年中更膨胀至二百八十五倍。如此的恶性通货膨胀与物价狂涨，不仅在中国历史上是空前的，即在世界史上也是少见的。
    与国民党统治区物价的暴涨相反，一年来我解放区的货币和物价是相当稳定的。去年十二月，我各解放区的物价与前年十二月比较，华北区与华东区约上涨三倍，西北区还不到一倍。这与国民党反动派统治区上涨了一千四百六十倍相比较，是不可同日而语的。近月来我华北各解放区的物价稍有波动，各货价格普遍上涨了百分之五十左右，这主要由于空前大规模的淮海战役与平津战役正在紧张进行，部队供给数量相当庞大，影响到局部地区一时的供求失调，再加上少数商人的投机操纵，市场交易暂时失去常态，故在战地周围开始引起一时的物价波动，逐渐波及其它地区。但是随着物资供应的改善，战役的胜利结束，物价仍将回到稳定的状态中。
    一年来，我解放区在货币制度方面，初步完成了统一工作。在抗日战争时期，我各解放区处于敌人严重的分割封锁环境下，在货币制度上不得不采用分区发行，分区流通的方针。日寇投降后，各个解放区随着自己内部地区上的逐渐连成一片，经济往来日益密切，即逐步地进行了本区货币的整理统一工作，如华中区以华中币统一了盐阜、江淮、淮南、淮北、江南等五六种地方货币；山东区宣布了各分区发行的北海币在全省统一流通，晋察冀和晋冀鲁豫也统一了自己地区内的各种地方货币。但在整个统一工作尚未完成时，国民党反动派随即发动内战，解放区有些地方被敌人侵占，致使这个统一工作不得不停顿下来。
    一九四七年下半年，人民解放军大举反攻以后，一年来随着人民解放战争的胜利进展，各解放区已经完全巩固，而且逐渐打成了一片，各地的物资交流日益发展起来。在这种情况下，为着适应经济发展的需要，一年来我们在华北、华东、西北三大解放区进行了货币统一工作。去年一月首先在西北解放区停止了陕甘宁边区银行货币的发行，使西北农民银行货币成为西北解放区的统一货币。接着四月间原晋冀鲁豫的冀南币与晋察冀边区的晋察冀边币固定比价互相流通。到十月间山东的北海币与华北的两种货币，西北的农币与华北的两种货币，先后固定比价，互相流通。十一月间北海币与华中币亦宣布等价通用。至此，我们的货币统一工作的第一步已大体完成。接着华北、山东和西北各解放区政府协商决定，把华北银行、北海银行、西北农民银行合并改组为中国人民银行，并于十二月一日开始由人民银行发行新币，作为三大解放区的统一货币。
    从以上货币统一工作的简单叙述中，我们不难了解，在短短的一年中，我们之所以能够进行如此伟大的货币统一工作，这一方面是由于战争的胜利，和我们顺应了解放区人民的意志与经济发展的要求，另方面也证明了我解放区已打下了强固的经济基础，有了雄厚的物资力量，足以支持货币统一工作的顺利进展。
    到今天，如果没有上述的货币统一工作，不发行统一的新币，则目前我们将会遇到许多新的困难问题，不但会使我各解放区间的物资交流，贸易往来，及各野战兵团协同作战中的供应采购工作遇到莫大的困难，而且在今后解放的许多大城市中迅速肃清蒋币，建立本币市场，稳定物价恢复秩序等工作中，亦将受到很大的阻碍。如目前平津周围地区，流通着币值不同的各种货币即达七八种之多，一旦平津解放，如我们没有一种统一的新货币来迅速占领市场，而让这七、八种货币一齐进城，则将会造成市场上很大的紊乱，人民既感不便，公私都没好处。相反的，我们今天有了统一的新货币，这就不但可以避免上述的一些困难，同时也更加加强了我们今后对敌经济斗争的力量。我们有充分的信心，相信在一九四九年中，解放区的货币统一工作，将随着人民解放战争的胜利，在全国范围内建立起统一的货币制度。
    从以上一年来国民党统治区与我解放区的货币、物价变化对比中，我们一方面可以看出：解放区的货币统一工作，与蒋匪的“改革币制”丝毫没有类似之点。蒋匪的所谓“改革币制”，目的是为实行更剧烈的通货膨胀，并以此来更残酷地掠夺人民。所以实行的结果，不但物价飞涨，民怨沸腾，而且更加速了经济崩溃。我们的货币统一，是为了使我们的货币制度更简单，更巩固，是为了更便利于物资交流，发展生产，繁荣经济。完全是从人民的利益出发的。另方面也证明了中国共产党领导下的人民大众，不但在军事上将对国民党反动派赢得彻底的胜利，而且在经济建设中的才能也远远超过于国民党反动派。（新华社陕北十一日电）
