　　Fighting Chiang's Army at the Front
　　Rushing Production in the Rear
　　To the officers and soldiers of the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army:
　　Over the past year, you have liberated many large cities and many people. The army and the people are united. The front is fighting the Chiang bandits, and the rear is rushing production. We are of one mind, thoroughly eliminating feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, and the aggressive forces of American imperialism.
　　Now the New Year is here, wishing you a happy New Year. Here we already have gongs and drums sounding to the sky. The people in the liberated areas are all happy. Wishing you good health!
