Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 19th: The six publicly-owned businesses in Luoyang City - Xie Feng, Qing Feng, Li Min, Yu Xin, Li Qun, and Hua Xing - organized production groups consisting of over six thousand poor people, women, and small vendors from August to the end of last year. They united over two hundred family handicraft businesses and small factories for production. As a result, not only was the livelihood problem of the poor citizens solved, but also the city's production undertaking was developed. Taking shoemaking as an example, the working citizens and twenty-nine private shoe factories united and organized around the public shoe factory can produce more than three thousand five hundred and eighty pairs of shoes every day. In addition to setting up shoe factories, the public businesses also opened towel factories and sock factories. On the one hand, the businesses lent cotton and spinning wheels to women who spun cotton; on the other hand, they collected the spun yarn as raw materials for weaving towels and socks. Women who spin can get one pound of cotton for every pound of yarn they spin. With the help of capital loans and sales of finished products from the public businesses, the production of various small factories and family handicraft businesses in the city has developed. According to incomplete statistics, the city produced more than 100,000 sweaters last year, exceeding the production volume of any previous year. More than 3,000 women and children participated in hand-knitting sweaters. The trade company purchased and sold more than 35,000 sweaters to the north. In addition, the public businesses purchased or assisted in the sale of more than 65,000 towels and more than 56,000 bars of soap, which enabled the development of the city's thirty-eight soap businesses, and the textile industry increased from 104 in August last year to the current 128. The reason why these public businesses can achieve such results is mainly because they solved the problems of raw materials, tools, and sales of finished products for the working masses, handicraft workers, and small factories. To help working women make shoes, the public businesses sent people to Zhengzhou to buy more than 4,000 kilograms of old cloth to supply them as raw materials for making shoes, and to help women who spun to sell their goods, they opened towel factories and sock factories.

　　洛阳公营商行组织市民生产成绩大
    【新华社中原十九日电】洛阳市协丰、庆丰、利民、裕信、利群、华兴六个公营商行，自去年八月到去年底，组织了六千多贫民、妇女、小商贩的生产小组，团结了二百余家庭手工业和小型工厂进行生产，结果不但解决了贫苦市民的生活问题，而且发展了该市的生产事业。拿做鞋一项来说，团结和组织在公营鞋厂周围的劳动市民和二十九个私营鞋厂，每天就能生产三千五百八十多双鞋。各公营商行除设鞋厂外，并开办有毛巾工厂和袜厂，商行一方面贷给纺花的妇女以棉花纺车，一方面收进纺线作为织毛巾和袜子的原料。纺妇们每纺一斤线，可取得棉花一斤的代价。在公营商行的贷给资本、代销成品的帮助下，该市各个小型工厂和家庭手工业者的生产都获得了发展。据不完全统计：该市去年生产毛衣达十万件以上，超过以往任何一年的生产量。参加手工织毛衣的妇女儿童超过了三千人，贸易公司收购后向北推销的毛衣即达三万五千多件。此外公营商行收购或助销毛巾六万五千多条，肥皂五万六千多件，这使得该市的三十八户肥皂业得以发展，纺织业亦由去年八月份的一百零四家增至现在的一百二十八家。这些公营商行之所以能有这样成绩，主要是因为解决了劳动群众、手工业者及小型工厂等，在原料、工具和成品推销等问题。为帮助劳动妇女做鞋，公营商行曾派人去郑州买了四千多斤旧布供给他们作做鞋原料，为帮助纺妇推销物品，又开办了毛巾工厂和袜厂。
