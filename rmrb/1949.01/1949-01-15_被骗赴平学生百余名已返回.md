(Jizhong Electric) The majority of students from Baoding City who were deceived into going to Peiping by the bandit Liu Hwa-nan have been successively liberated by our People's Liberation Army, which has surrounded Peiping on all sides. With the help of our army and the democratic government, more than a hundred of them returned to Baoding on the 26th of last month. According to the returned students, they wandered in Peiping for seven days. The Kuomintang authorities, fearing they would follow in the footsteps of Northeastern University – causing so-called "trouble" – used the excuse of "food and lodging being assured in the Western Hills, and classes still able to be attended" to drive them to the Western Hills. Arriving at places like the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills, they braved the severe cold of December, sleeping curled up on the ground in the tall temples and the bandit officials' summer villas, chopping firewood, milling rice, and cooking during the day, and drinking thin porridge twice a day. They did not attend a single class for more than a month. The entire faculty and students of Baoding Normal School, numbering two hundred and thirteen, went to the city on the afternoon of the 11th to negotiate for food. They were shot at by bandits halfway there and had to run back. When the Western Hills area was liberated by our army, they had run out of food and drink. The People's Liberation Army immediately provided them with one thousand catties of grain, and in a planned manner coordinated with local areas to distribute grain coupons in batches, sending them home.

　　被骗赴平学生百余名已返回
    【冀中电】保定市被刘匪化南欺骗赴平的大部学生，在解放军四面八方包围北平后，相继为我解放，并在我军及民主政府帮助下，已有百余名于上月二十六日返６抵保定。据回来学生说：他们在北平流浪了七天，国民党当局怕他们步东北大学的后尘——所谓“捣乱”，以“到西山去食宿无虞，尚能上课”为词，驱往西山。他们到了西山碧云寺等地，冒着十二月的严寒，在高大的寺院和匪官们的避暑山庄里，夜里蜷睡在地上，白天砍柴、碾米、作饭，每天喝两顿稀粥。一个多月没有上过一次课。保师全体师生二百一十三人，为了吃饭，十一号下午去城内交涉粮食，走到半路被匪开枪射击，只好又跑回来。当西山一带为我解放时，他们正没吃喝了，解放军马上接济了他们一千斤谷子，并有计划的和地方联系，分批发给粮票，转送他们回家。
