　　Kim Il-sung – Person's name. He is the Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and one of the leaders of the Workers' Party of Korea. He is thirty-six years old this year, born in Man'gingu Village, Korea, and participated in the revolution at a young age. When the Japanese bandits occupied Northeast China, Kim Il-sung was not yet twenty years old, and he served as the secretary of the East Manchurian Communist Youth League. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he participated in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, developing the original thirty-person guerrilla team to 100,000 people, and fought bravely against the Japanese bandits. After the surrender of the Japanese bandits, he served as the chairman of the North Korean Provisional People's Committee. In September of last year (1948), the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea opened and elected him as the Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, authorizing him to form the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
　　Message – A type of official document used by parallel government agencies that do not have direct subordinate relationships to explain, consult, or request something from each other. According to the American system, the President and Congress are parallel, so the official document used by the President to explain, consult, or request something from Congress is translated as a message.
　　Wagner Act – An American labor relations bill. This bill was proposed by Senator Wagner, a Democratic member of the U.S. Senate, during the Roosevelt administration in 1935 and passed by Congress (hence it is called the Wagner Act). The Wagner Act is a relatively democratic bill. According to this law, workers have the right to organize unions, participate in strikes, or voluntary arbitration (when disputes occur between workers and capitalists, mediation can be carried out without the use of coercive means by state organs or capitalist-controlled organs). However, this bill was only implemented until February 7, 1936, when it was replaced by the reactionary Case Act.
　　American Slavic Congress – The representative assembly of the "American Slavic Federation." The "American Slavic Federation" is a democratic organization of Slavs residing in the United States who have become American citizens, with the aim of opposing the reactionary measures of the American authorities. This organization includes approximately thirty-six American-Slavic organizations, with the goal of uniting the 15 million Slavs residing in the United States to participate in the movement to fight for democracy and progress, and has played a significant role in the American democratic movement. The fourth congress was held last September to fight for the peaceful and democratic rights of the American people. The reactionary American government arrested the congress secretary, Pilinsky (later released on bail), to prevent the congress from proceeding, but ultimately failed to achieve its effect. The congress supported Wallace and Taylor as the Progressive Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates in the election campaign. The congress has seventy-five official members, twenty-five alternate members, with Kerzcki as the chairman, Balakowitz as the vice-chairman, and Pilinsky as the secretary.
　　American Progressive Party – A new party established in the United States on July 23 of last year. It was developed from the "American Progressive Citizens Association" led by Wallace. Initially referred to as the Third Party, it was permanently named the Progressive Party when it was officially established last July. It is currently a broad united front organization of democratic forces in the United States, including representatives of workers, farmers, blacks, progressive intellectuals, and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. The unions participating in this party include the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, the Fur and Leather Workers Union, the Farm Equipment Workers Union, the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers Union, and the United Office and Professional Workers of America, a total of eleven major national unions affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations. It also receives the active support of the American Slavic Congress, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, the National Negro Congress, the National Farmers Union, and the American Labor Party. The Communist Party USA is a proactive advocate for this party. The chairman of the Progressive Party is Binson, who once supported Wallace's campaign for chairman of the National Committee, and the vice-chairmen are black leader and singer Robeson and Fitzzgerald, president of the UE. The party platform advocates a peaceful foreign policy, supports the national democratic independence struggles of Asian countries such as China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaya, advocates the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China, opposes the U.S. government's military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and advocates friendly diplomacy with the Soviet Union; advocates that people enjoy freedom rights, opposes discrimination against blacks and persecution of blacks; opposes economic policies that seek profits for monopoly capitalists, and advocates increasing the economy of social wealth. The birth of this new party in the United States has been supported by the majority of the American people. In the last presidential election, the party nominated Wallace and Taylor as their presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Despite various sabotage, destruction, and persecution by the American ruling authorities, the lack of media organs across the country to promote the party, and the fact that American fascists prohibited people from openly supporting the Progressive Party, more than 1.1 million votes were cast in open support, so of course, the number of people who truly support the Progressive Party is not limited to this number. With the struggle of the Communist Party USA, the Progressive Party, and various democratic people's organizations, the American democratic movement has broad prospects for development.

    咨文——平行的、没有直接隶属关系的政务机关，相互用以说明、征询或请求什么事情的一种公文。依据美国的制度，总统与国会是平行的，所以总统对国会有什么事情要说明、征询或请求，所用的公文就译做咨文。
    华格纳法——是美国的一个劳工关系法案。这个法案是在一九三五年，罗斯福总统执政期间，美国国会参议院民主党的议员华格纳提出来经国会通过的（所以就叫做华格纳法）。华格纳法是比较民主的一个法案，根据此法工人有组织工会、参加罢工、或自愿仲裁（工人与资本家发生纠纷时，可以不由国家机关或资本家的御用机关以强制的手段执行调解）等权利。但这个法案只实行到一九三六年二月七日，就被反动的凯斯法案所代替了。
    美国斯拉夫人大会——是“美国斯拉夫人联合会”的代表大会。“美国斯拉夫人联合会”是居住在美国的、已加入美国国籍的斯拉夫人以反对美国当局反动措施为目的的一个民主组织。这个组织包括了约三十六个美籍斯拉夫人的组织，目标是联合居住在美国的一千五百万斯拉夫人起来参加争取民主与进步的运动，在美国的民主运动中曾起有不小的作用。去年九月曾举行第四届大会，争取美国人民和平民主权利。美国反动政府曾逮捕大会书记皮林斯基（后交保释放）以阻止大会的进行，但终未能得到效果。大会曾支持华莱士及泰勒为进步党的正副总统候选人选举运动。大会正式委员有七十五名，候补委员二十五人，正主席为克尔兹基，副主席是巴拉科维兹，书记是皮林斯基。
    美国进步党——是美国于去年七月二十三日成立的一个新党。由华莱士领导的“美国进步公民协会”发展组成。初有第三党的称呼，于去年七月正式成立时才永久定名为进步党。是目前美国民主势力广泛的统一战线组织，包括了工人、农民、黑人、进步知识分子和中小企业家的代表，参加这个党的在工会方面有产业工会联合会所属的码头工会、电气工会、毛皮工会、农具工会、粮食烟草工会、职员与雇员工会十一个全国性的大工会，并获得美籍斯拉夫人大会、南方人类福利大会、黑人青年大会、全国农民同盟、美国劳工党等的积极支持；美国共产党是这个党的积极倡导者。进步党的正主席是曾拥护华莱士竞选全国委员会主席宾生，副主席是黑人领袖及歌王罗伯逊及产联电气工人工会主席费兹吉那德。该党纲领主张和平的外交政策，支持亚洲如中国、印尼、越南、马来亚等国的民族民主独立斗争，主张撤退驻华美军，反对美政府对蒋介石的军事援助，并主张与苏联进行友好外交；主张人民享有自由权利，反对歧视黑人、迫害黑人；反对为独占资本家谋利的经济政策，主张增加社会财富的经济。这个新党在美国的诞生，得到美国大多数人民的拥护，在上次总统竞选中，该党提出了华莱士和泰勒为他们的正副总统候选人，在美国统治当局予以各种破坏、摧残和迫害，全国各地又没有什么言论机关替他宣传，加上美国法西斯派的不准人民公开拥护进步党种种不利的条件下，仍有一百一十多万票公开拥护，当然真正拥护进步党的人数就不只是这个数目了。在美国共产党和进步党及各民主人民团体的奋斗下，美国民主运动是有广阔发展的前途的。
