Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd. Since the Taihang Industrial Company's affiliated factories and mines managers' meeting last October, the separate and decentralized management has shifted to unified management. This shift has put Taihang's public enterprises on a sound development path. In the past, due to environmental and conditional limitations, Taihang area factories and mines had to implement separate (decentralized) management and self-sufficiency. Now, with the liberated areas becoming increasingly consolidated and expanded, and transportation and other conditions more convenient than before, unified leadership and unified management have become urgent needs, especially for more planned and organized development of production. After the unified management of public industrial and mining enterprises in the district, the following benefits are obtained compared with separate management: (1) Materials are easily allocated. Now, Taihang Industrial Company stipulates that all materials of each factory and mine, except for those planned to be used in the current period (from November of this year to July of this year), shall be handed over to the company for unified allocation according to the urgent needs of each factory and mine. This will avoid the unreasonable phenomenon of material surplus and shortage between factories in the past, which cannot be adjusted. (2) Factories and mines of the same nature cooperate to implement joint procurement and sales, avoiding mutual competition. (3) Factories and mines of different natures help each other. For example, the Jiazhang Coal Mine supplies Huafeng Machine Factory with coal, Huaxing Iron Smelting Plant supplies Huafeng with gray iron, and Huafeng supplies them with machines. (4) The surplus from factories and mines producing daily necessities is used to support machine factories, manufacture new equipment, and establish new enterprises. (5) Saving capital. For example, coal kilns use a lot of oil, so a new oil pressing factory is specially set up, and the oil payment is pre-paid to the factory, which guarantees the supply of oil. In this way, the oil house does not need to raise more funds to establish a new enterprise. In the past, coal mines purchased oil with great difficulty, and sometimes prepaid the oil payment to the oil house, but when prices changed, the oil house often did not deliver oil, or delivered bad oil. Setting up its own oil factory not only guarantees the supply of oil, but is also cheaper than buying from the oil house.

Taihang Electric: Since the unified management of the Taihang Industrial Company, in order to accurately calculate costs, avoid the impact of price fluctuations during the war, and enable the affiliated factories and mines to accurately calculate profits and losses in mutual allocation without suffering losses, a "Ben" (本) is specially created as a unit of calculation. The formulation of the "Ben" unit is based on the proportion of raw materials, wages, etc. included in the finished products produced by each factory and mine. For example, Huaxing Iron Smelting Plant uses the raw materials and wages required for each catty of gray iron as a "Ben," that is, twelve catties of coal, three and a half catties of ore, one and a half catties of crucible clay, ten taels of charcoal, three and a half catties of coal, and 0.13@ of wages. Huafeng Iron Factory takes the proportion of raw materials and wages required for producing one iron car, planer, ten-foot lathe, and 25-horsepower steam engine from April to December as a "Ben." That is, five catties of gray pig iron, one catty of ingot iron, twenty catties of coal, two and a half catties of coke, one @ of wages, and four taels of sesame oil. The coal mine takes the raw materials and wages required for one ton of coal as a "Ben," that is, two medium-sized wooden pillars, twelve taels of oil, fifty catties of power coal, and five @ of wages. Cotton mills, silk weaving factories, and equipment sections all determine different "Ben" units with different raw materials and wages. The method of using "Ben" is that when each factory and mine pays cash to the company, the company not only records the amount of currency, but also collects the "Ben" number of the factory according to the local market price; when the finished products of each factory and mine are delivered, after obtaining the receipt from the other party, the company is reported for transfer according to the current market price of the factory and mine "Ben" number; when each factory and mine receives money from the company, the company converts the "Ben" number of the factory and mine according to the market price. After each factory and mine determines its capital, in addition to keeping accounts in currency, it must also keep accounts in "Ben" units according to its business. When the Industrial Company makes a final account, "Ben" is used as the unit for calculating profit and loss. Within the company, except for the equipment section, which has a separate "Ben" for physical objects, the entire company calculates a total "Ben" according to the proportion of all affiliated factories and mines for accounting.

Since the implementation of the unified management system of Taihang Industrial Company, the exchanges between various factories and mines and the company have become more frequent, and prices fluctuate frequently. Currency cannot represent the fixed physical objects of its operation. Using "Ben" as a unit can ensure that factory production is less affected by price changes, adapt to the different businesses of each factory and mine, and truly represent the physical objects it operates. The problem of unclear profits and losses and final accounts in the past few years can be overcome. In the liquidation of assets, although there were currency figures in the past, due to price changes, they could not correctly represent the actual property funds. This drawback can be avoided by using "Ben" units. Also, if each factory and mine handles cash improperly, it will often suffer losses due to price changes. Using "Ben" can reduce cash savings and strengthen turnover, so as to avoid over-occupation of capital and capital stagnation.

　　有计划有组织地发展生产
  　太行公营厂矿统一经营
    创造“本”单位精确计算成本
    【新华社华北二日电】太行实业公司所属各厂矿，自去年十月各厂矿经理会议后，已由单独分散的经营转向统一经营。这一转变使太行各公营企业走上健全的发展道路。太行区各厂矿过去因环境及条件所限，曾不得不实行单独（分散）经营，自给自足。现在解放区日益巩固扩大，交通等条件较前便利，特别是为了更有计划有组织地发展生产，统一领导，统一经营，便成为目前迫切的需要。该区各公营工矿实行统一经营后，较单独经营获得下列好处：（一）物资便于调拨。现太行实业公司规定各厂矿所有物资除本期（由年十一月至今年七月）计划应用者外，其余一律交由公司按各厂矿急需，统一调拨。这样就可避免过去各厂间的物资过剩与缺乏，两者不相调剂的不合理现象。（二）同一性质厂矿合作起来实行了联合采购推销，避免互相争购。（三）不同性质厂矿，互相帮助。如贾掌煤矿供给华丰机器厂用炭，华兴炼铁厂供给华丰灰铁，而华丰则供给他们机器。（四）以生产日用品的厂矿的盈余，支援机器厂，制造新的装备，建立新的企业。（五）节省资本。如煤窑用油很多，特新设一榨油厂，预交该厂油款，由该厂保证供给用油。这样油房无需多筹资金，即可建立新企业。过去煤矿购油，殊费周折，有时预交油房油款，因物价变动时油房往往不交油，或交坏油。自设油厂既保证用油不缺，又较向油房购买便宜。
    【太行电】太行实业公司自统一经营后，为精确计算成本，免受战争期间物价波动的影响，并使所属各厂矿在互相调拨中能精确计算盈亏，互不吃亏，特创造以“本”作为计算单位。“本”单位的制定是以各厂矿在生产成品中包括一定比例的原料、工资等为根据，如：华兴炼铁厂是以每斤灰铁所需要的原料和工资为一个“本”，即石炭十二斤、矿石三斤半、坩土斤半、木炭十两、煤三斤半、工资零点一三＠。华丰铁工厂是以四月至十二月份生产铁车、刨床、十尺元车、二十五匹马力蒸汽机各一部所需原料、工资之比例为根据作一个“本”。即灰生铁五斤、元铁一斤、石炭二十斤、焦炭二斤半、工资一个＠，麻油四两。煤矿是以一吨煤所需之原料和工资为一个“本”，即中等木柱二根，油十二两，动力煤五十斤，工资五个＠。纱厂、丝织厂、器材科都以不同之原料、工资，定出不同内容的“本”单位。“本”的使用方法为各厂矿向公司交现款时，公司除记货币数外，并按该地市价折收该厂“本”数；各厂矿成品交出时，取得对方收据后，按当时市价折合该厂矿“本”数报公司转帐；各厂矿向公司领款时按市价折合该厂矿“本”数。各厂矿决定资本后，除按货币记帐外，并须按其业务用“本”单位折合记帐。实业公司决算时，以“本”为核算盈亏单位。公司内部除器材科据本科实物另订有“本”外，全公司核算时，均按全部所属厂矿比例算出一个总合“本”以进行核算。
    太行实业公司自统一经营管理制度实行后，各厂矿与公司来往更加频繁，物价经常波动，货币不能代表其经营之一定实物，用“本”作单位，可保证工厂生产少受物价影响，适应各厂矿业务之不同，真实代表其所经营的实物，几年来算不清盈亏与决算的毛病可以克服。在清理财产上，过去虽有货币数字，因物价变动，不能正确地代表出实有财产资金，用“本”单位即可免此弊病。又各厂矿如现金处理不当，常会因物价变动而受损失，用“本”可减少现金储蓄加强周转，以免多占资本及资本死滞。
