　　A Discussion on "Good Ultimately Triumphs Over Evil"
    Geng Xi
    I have been thinking about the following issues concerning Comrade Zhao Shuli's new work, "Good Ultimately Triumphs Over Evil," and the post-reading reflections by Comrades Han Beisheng and Dang Ziqiang on page four of the People's Daily on December 21st. I am putting them forward for everyone to critique:
    First, I believe Zhao Shuli's work is not writing about an ordinary love story, but is using this story to write about our Party's land reform policy. In particular, it writes about how a Party branch wrongly implemented the Party's policy towards middle peasants during the land reform and then corrected it. This novel unfolds in the midst of this fluctuation within a middle peasant family. This is precisely a certain aspect and microcosm of our land reform movement. Therefore, this work can only be measured by our Party's policy in the land reform. (Of course, other works reflecting land reform are no exception.) Leaving this standard, I think it is difficult to touch the essence of this novel. So, how should we measure this novel with our Party's policy? I believe that in our liberated area's literary works, this novel is still the first to reflect our Party's policy so clearly, vividly, richly, and relatively deeply.
    The ending of "Good Ultimately Triumphs Over Evil" overthrows the "Xiao Dan line," everything is revealed, and the love problem between Xiao Bao and Ruan Ying is satisfactorily resolved. The relationship between middle and poor peasants and the Party and the masses has been improved. Even Ju Cai, a person who was afraid of everything, actually spoke his mind: "This is really a place where reason can be spoken." It shows a new atmosphere of rural class unity. The theme, genre, story, and language of the novel are extremely beautiful. I think this is a new success on the literary front of our liberated areas. I even understand it this way: In the outstanding works of the people's writer Zhao Shuli, it is probably epoch-making, and in the entire literary movement of our liberated areas, it is probably a new starting point. Because it reflects the earth-shattering movement of changing the social foundation, and reflects the policy and ideology that guides the progress of millions of people's lives. The appearance of this novel should attract sufficient attention and research from the literary circles of the liberated areas.
    Of course, starting from here, I have many different views from Comrade Dang Ziqiang. I do not agree that Ruan Ying is the protagonist of the novel. I think the protagonist of the novel should be the two sides who execute and accept the policy: Yuan Hai and Ju Cai. Ruan Ying is just an important foil to Ju Cai. Her love story is just a horizontal line connecting this novel. I also disagree with the statement that "the Ruan Ying on paper is divorced from the actual Ruan Ying," and there is no need to "explain her personality from her innate disposition." There are many young women in the countryside who are as determined and infatuated with their lovers as she is, but the old society often forced them to separate. Ruan Ying is one who has been liberated through struggle in the new society. It's just that the development process is written simply, but there is no need to rigidly apply the set of dead rules of "hope, struggle, wavering, to firm." His ideological sources are only two: one is the feudal shackles inherited from her father, and the other is Xiao Bao whom she admires and the new society represented by Xiao Bao and others. She is very young and easily accepts this new ideology, so in order to adapt to the environment, she naturally forms a set that is expressed in the novel. As for the last time she pretended to refuse the marriage, she was basically afraid that her father would cause trouble. It was an expedient way to love her father and not lose her lover Xiao Bao. It did not completely violate her father's will, and when Ju Cai did not allow her to fall in love with Xiao Bao, she also argued with him. It can be seen that she is not completely obedient to her father. These two psychological aspects have contradictions and struggles, which is both reasonable and realistic. It's just that the impact of the new society on her is written too little, so it seems that the basis of her ideological change is not very sufficient. Although this is a shortcoming, it does not affect the important value of the novel.
    I disagree even more with the statement that "the Communist Party on paper is divorced from the actual Communist Party," even though Comrade Ziqiang put forward two specific reasons: "Since the branch secretary has always been correct, how can he get along with Xiao Dan?" "Xiao Bao's failure to stand up and fight is not enough to express his justice." I think it is still not enough to overturn it as "reality." Because in our rural branches, when policy concepts are not clear and the mass line is not clear, they will of course only see people like Xiao Dan who can speak, dare to do, and know how to do things. Among the peasants who want to turn over and awaken but are unwilling to come forward themselves, there is the idea of using this "cannon." Yuan Hai of course treats Xiao Dan in this way, but it is not "getting along." Although this view is extremely incorrect, it is indeed a kind of reality at the time. It is not written clearly in the novel, which makes it easy for people to doubt, which is also a shortcoming. And Xiao Bao is precisely the so-called "small Party member" who was suppressed and dared not speak out under the lack of democratic style at that time. In the rural branches before Party rectification, there were quite a few such Party members. They had no power and no influence, and what could they do if they fought? This is another kind of reality. If he could really fight through, the Party would not need rectification. Besides, Xiao Bao has already been expelled from the Party! He has not completely turned over, has not occupied too much fruit, and his quality of insisting on the truth and never succumbing is already very good. I don't understand what kind of rural Party members Comrade Dang Ziqiang understands, but in my opinion, Yuan Hai and Xiao Bao are extremely common types in rural branches. My understanding is completely opposite to that of Comrade Dang Ziqiang. I think it is a bit unrealistic to imagine rural branch Party members too highly. As for "writing out the roots of darkness" and fearing that "writing the lackeys more powerful than dogs," I don't think there is any need to worry about it, because that is not the theme of this novel. The landlord class has been overthrown, and the remaining powerful ones are of course the lackeys. But this does not prove that the lackeys are more powerful than "dogs." Moreover, in the late stage of land reform, what easily makes us make mistakes is not the overthrown landlords, but our blindly following the "gangster line." Why do we have to drag a tail in every work and write that the landlords are stubbornly resisting? Don't they have lost their power in our old liberated areas? I think there is no need to demand this work in such a formulaic way. Therefore, to sum up: I also disagree with Comrade Dang Ziqiang's conclusion. That conclusion seems to be deduced from several fixed frames and does not fit the actual analysis. Therefore, I think "Good Ultimately Triumphs Over Evil" is by no means a "Strange Tales from the Present and Past," but a vivid novel with great practical educational significance. Below, I put forward a few points I have seen as a basis:
    First, about the education of implementing policies: The political director (ie, the village branch secretary) Yuan Hai did not understand the Party's policy, opposed meeting the demands of poor peasants and hired laborers to not touching the middle peasants, catered to certain narrow economic demands of the activists, and became their tail, making left-leaning errors. His ideological situation is extremely common in our rural branches. For example, he thought: "The superiors don't want to touch the middle peasants. On the one hand, there is nothing to fill the hole, and on the other hand, the activists won't do it if they don't get fruit, and the task will not be completed..." He also heard that not only the activists, but also some cadres said that they wouldn't do it if they didn't get fruit, which made him even more anxious: This passage summarizes his thoughts very well: he does not have a deep understanding of not touching the middle peasants, nor does he understand what should be used to fill the hole, nor does he understand what the purpose of filling the hole is. Therefore, he is emptyly completing the task. He is afraid that the activists will not do it and the task will not be completed, which shows that he does not have the complete idea of relying on the poor and hired peasants to unite the middle peasants and eliminate feudalism. As soon as Xiao Dan incites him, the wind blows to the side of those who have the most. He became the tail. But when he wanted to fight Ju Cai, a middle peasant who started from labor, he hesitated. He said: "...Everyone must fight him, but we can only ask him to contribute some land and some things. If we treat him like other feudal remnants and drive him out of the house, we really feel sorry." Here, because of his simple and kind class essence, coupled with understanding the specific situation in the village, he vaguely realizes the Party's policy towards the middle peasants. He also said to several cadres at the table: "It's not appropriate to move so many middle peasants! Why don't we wait a few days for Comrade Gao, the work team member, to come and then do it?" But when people said that they were afraid of the wind blowing and not getting anything, he wavered and started doing it without asking for instructions from his superiors. This passage is not only true and vivid, but also educational. Who is not like this who does not deeply understand the Party's policy? They left the policy and also left the masses, and were full of desire to do things well, but the result was bad.
    Second, through Xiao Dan's activities, we can understand that the true face of the deviation in rural land reform is: because our rural branch's policy line is not clear, we were fooled by gangsters and made things bad. This is not that our policy is wrong, or that there is a serious problem with the rural Party, but that there is a problem with the view of implementing policies and the work style. Xiao Dan in the novel deeply educated us. There is an "evil spirit" in him, and this "evil spirit" does not know what dangerous step it will lead us to.
    Third, the novel fully introduces the ideological situation of the middle peasants with the character of Ju Cai: he has the resentment of "too bullying," and also the idea of "people have no foresight...let's see." He holds a conservative, yielding, suspicious, and distrustful attitude towards everything; but after the problem of Ruan Ying was reasonably resolved at the Party rectification meeting, he finally said: "This is really a place where reason can be spoken." He is no longer afraid of others' revenge. This character is the most prominent and perfect in the whole novel. Here, we are also given an inspiration. The middle and poor peasants were originally one family. His "changing the sky idea" comes from the fear of the long-term exploitation of the old society. As long as we do not infringe on their interests, they are willing to unite around us and remove the idea of changing the sky.
    Then, as long as the policy is reflected, does this work have no shortcomings? I think the shortcomings are not as serious as those mentioned by Comrade Dang Ziqiang, but they do exist:
    First, in the fourth chapter of the novel, the Party rectification meeting only gives people a feeling of distinguishing right from wrong. Although this also shows the spirit of democracy, no one in the masses speaks. It only seems that the work team is distinguishing right from wrong there, a bit like "asking the lawsuit." The masses hate Xiao Dan and care for and love the Party. Why don't they express their opinions or attitudes? And our "justice" comes from the masses, is improved and then goes to the masses. There must be this "justice" or the prototype of "justice" in the masses. It is incorrect not to write this out. The relationship between the Party and the masses and the spirit of democracy are not sufficiently expressed. It does not end this novel with the atmosphere of the masses loving the Party and eagerly hoping to solve the problem, so it seems powerless. This is probably an important shortcoming.
    Second, from the progress of the whole novel, I feel that the author's creative intention is not clear enough, especially the characters representing the implementation of the policy are not written enough, which makes it easy for people to read this novel from the perspective of Ruan Ying, so the more they read, the more they feel dissatisfied. This is probably completely contrary to the author's original creative intention.
    Third, there are more technical problems in the characterization, the integrity of the story structure, etc. From this aspect alone, this novel may not be as good as other works, but this is a new attempt and leap forward, and the weight of the work has been greatly increased by its rich content. From Comrade Shuli's general works, it seems that he has a concise, simple, and even restrained style in terms of writing style and story organization. I don't know if this novel is too tight, but many characters such as Yuan Hai's contradiction in implementing policies, his views on Xiao Dan and Xiao Chang, Xiao Bao's views on Xiao Chang, the struggle inside and outside the branch, and even Ruan Ying, etc., have not been expanded. In fact, these characters in the novel have dual contradictory psychology, which can be written about, but what we see is a rush through the three key passes. A mention and then gone, so I am very dissatisfied and feel a bit rough. If compared with characters such as Anfa, Lao Guai, Er Yi, Ju Cai, and even Gou Gou, it feels far less intimate than they are written. Maybe there is also a life problem here, or maybe our writers are not familiar enough with the new life of the peasants, or maybe.
    But despite these shortcomings, "Good Ultimately Triumphs Over Evil" is still a very valuable novel. The current problem seems to be that we should consolidate the achievements already made in Comrade Shuli's work, study experience, and develop the literary movement in the liberated areas to welcome the coming great victory era. I believe that in the cultural nursery of the people's liberated areas, in the near future, we will see more perfect works by Comrade Zhao Shuli.

### 漫谈“邪不压正”

　　漫谈“邪不压正”
    耿西
    我对于赵树理同志的新作：“邪不压正”及人民日报十二月二十一日四版韩北生与党自强两同志的读后感，零星的想到以下问题，提出请大家指正：
    首先，我以为赵树理这个作品不是在写一个普通的恋爱故事，而是透过这个故事在写我们党的土改政策。特别是在写一个支部在土改中怎样把党对中农的政策执行错了，而又把它改正过来。这篇小说便是在这种波动中发生在一个中农家庭的故事。这正是我们在土改运动中的某个侧面与缩影。因此，这个作品只能拿我们党土改中的政策去衡量。（当然别的作品如反映土改也不能例外。）离开了这个标准，我以为很难涉及到这篇小说的本质。那么，拿我们党的政策去衡量这篇小说又怎样呢？我以为在我们解放区的文艺作品中，这篇小说还是第一个这样明确、生动、丰富而又较为深刻的反映了我们党的政策。
    “邪不压正”的结尾打倒了“小旦路线”，一切真象大白，圆满的解决了小宝与软英的恋爱问题，中贫农和党群关系都得到了改善。连聚财那种前怕狼后怕虎的人也居然说出了心里的话：“这真是个说理的地方。”显出了农村阶级团结的新气象。小说的主题、体裁、故事、语言都是极其美妙的，我以为这是我们解放区文艺战线上一种新的成功。我甚至于这样理解：在人民作家赵树理杰出的作品之中，恐怕是划阶段的，在我们整个解放区的文艺运动中，恐怕也是个新的起点。因为它反映了更动社会基础的、轰轰烈烈的运动，而且反映了指导千万人生活前进的政策思想。这篇小说的出现，应该引起解放区文艺界足够的注意与研究。
    当然，从这里出发，我和党自强同志的看法便有许多不同了。我不同意软英是小说的主人公，我认为小说的主人公应该是执行与接受政策的两方面：元孩和聚财，软英不过是聚财反面的重要陪衬人物。其恋爱故事不过是联串这篇小说的一条横线。我也不同意“纸上的软英是脱离实际的软英”，对于她的个性也用不着“从其天赋的秉性去解释”的说法。农村里象她这样坚决、慕恋她爱人的青年妇女多得很，只是旧社会往往把她们逼得离散了。软英则是在新社会中经过斗争得到解放的一个。只是其发展过程写得简单一些，但也不必按照由“希望、斗争、动摇，至坚定”那一套死板规律硬套，他的思想来源只有两个：一个是秉源自他父亲而来的封建束缚，另一个是她爱慕的小宝以及为小宝他们所代表的新社会，他很年青很容易接受这种新的思想，于是为了适应环境，便很自然的形成了所表现在小说中的一套，至于最后一次伪装赖婚，她基本上是怕父亲惹祸，是既为了爱她的父亲又不失为小宝爱人的变通办法，并没有完全违背她父亲的意志，而且当聚财不准她和小宝恋爱时，她还和他吵过架，可见她也并不完全顺着她的父亲，这两重心理有矛盾、有斗争，是既合理又合乎实际的。只是新社会对她的影响写的太少了，因此显得其思想变化的根据似乎还不很充分。这虽是个缺点，但并不影响小说的重要价值。
    我更不同意“纸上的共产党是脱离实际的共产党”，尽管自强同志提出了两个具体的理由：“支部书记既然一贯正确怎么能和小旦合得来？”“小宝不敢挺身而斗，不足以表达其正”，我认为还是不足以推翻其为“实际”，因为在我们农村支部中，当政策观念不明确，群众路线不明确的时候，他们当然只会看到小旦那号能说，敢干，会干的人，在想要翻身觉悟程度不高又不愿自己出头的农民之中，有利用这杆“大炮”的思想，元孩当然也以此对待小旦，但不是“合得来”。这观点虽极不正确，但确实是当时的一种实际，小说中未写清楚，容易使人怀疑也是个缺点。而小宝则正是当时缺乏民主作风之下的所谓“小党员”是被压着不敢吭气的，在整党前的农村支部中，这样的党员还不少，他们无权无势，斗又顶得了什么？这又是一种实际。如果，他真能斗过来，党也就不需要整了。何况小宝已经被开除了党籍！？他未翻透身没有多占过果实，而且坚持真理，从未屈服的品质已经是很好的了。我不理解党自强同志所理解的农村党员是怎样的，但在我看来，元孩、小宝却正是农村支部中极为普遍的典型。我和党自强同志所理解的正完全相反，我觉得把农村支部党员想象得过高，似乎反而有点不近乎实际。至于“要写出黑暗的根子来，”怕“把狗腿写的比狗还厉害”，我倒觉得不必如此顾虑，因为那不是这篇小说的主题，地主阶级已打倒在地，剩下厉害的当然要算狗腿了。但这也并不证明狗腿就比“狗”还厉害，而且我们在土改末期中容易使我们犯错误的，倒不是那些打倒在地的地主，而是我们盲目的走了“流氓路线”，为什么我们每篇作品都要拖一个尾巴写着地主在顽固的抵抗呢？难道在我们老解放区他们还没有大势已去么？我以为不必要这样公式的要求这个作品。因此，总起来说：我也不同意党自强同志那种结论。那结论好象是从几个固定的框子里推断出来的，并没有切合实际的分析。因此，我认为“邪不压正”绝不是一篇“今古奇观”，而是一篇活生生的，具有莫大现实教育意义的小说。以下我提出我所看到的几点根据：
    第一、关于执行政策的教育：政治主任（按即村支部书记）元孩不明确党的政策，把满足贫雇要求和不动中农对立起来，迁就了积极分子中某种狭隘经济要求，当了他们的尾巴，犯了左倾错误，他的思想状况在我们农村支部中是极为普遍的，比如他想：“上级不叫动中农，一方面没有东西填窟窿，一方面积极分子分不到果实不干，任务就完不成……”又听得不止积极分子，有些干部也说分不到果实不干，更叫他着急：这一段话把他的思想概括得很好：他对于不动中农是了解不深刻的，也不了解应该拿什么来补窟窿，又不理解补窟窿又是为着什么？因此，他在空洞的完成任务，他害怕积极分子不干就完成不了任务，足见他没有完整的依靠贫雇农团结中农消灭封建的思想。等小旦一鼓动，大风倒在户越多越好那边，他就做了尾巴了。但要斗争劳动起家的中农聚财时，他又犹豫起来，他说：“……大家一定要斗人家，也只能叫他献些地献些东西，要跟别的封建尾巴一样，弄得扫地出门咱实在过意不去。”这里，由于他朴实的良善阶级本质，再加上了解了村里的具体情况，他是模糊的意识到党对中农的政策的。他又跟桌子边的几个干部说：“动这么多的中农可是不妥当呀！要不等几天高工作员来了再搞吧。”但是人们一说怕走了风，闹不到东西，他又动摇，不等请示上级便干起来了。这一段描写，不但真实、生动，而且富有教育意义，不深刻了解党的政策的人，谁不是这样呢？他们离开了政策，也离开了群众，满心要把事情做好，结果做坏了。
    第二、透过小旦的活动，使我们了解了农村土改发生偏向的真实面貌是：由于我们农村支部的政策路线不明确，上了流氓分子的当，把事情做坏了，这并不是我们的政策错了。或者农村党有严重得了不起的问题，而是执行政策的观点，工作作风上有了毛病，小说里的小旦深刻的教育了我们，他那里有一股“邪气”，这“邪气”不知道要把我们带到什么危险地步。
    第三、小说以聚财这个人物充分的介绍了中农的思想状况：他有“太欺人呀”的愤恨，也有“人没前后眼……看看再说”的想法，他对于一切都抱着保守、退让、怀疑与不信任的态度；但是在整党会上软英的问题合理解决以后，他终于说：“这真是个说理的地方。”再不怕别人报复了，这个人物在全篇小说是写得最突出最完善的。这里也给了我们一个启示，中贫农本来是一家，他的“变天思想”是由旧社会历来的压榨所惊怕而来的，只要我们不侵害他们的利益，他们是愿意团结在我们周围，而去掉变天思想的。
    那末，只要反映了政策，这个作品便算没有缺点了么？我以为缺点虽没有党自强同志提的那样严重，但却是有：
    一、小说的第四章，整党会上只给了人一个辨别是非的感觉，虽然这也表现了民主精神，但群众中没有人发言；只是显得工作团在那里辨别是非，有点象“问官司”。群众是憎恶小旦而关心与热爱党的，为什么他们不发表意见或表示态度呢？而我们的“正”又是从群众中来，经过提高再到群众中去，群众中一定有这种“正”或“正”的雏型，这一点没写出来是不正确的，党群关系民主精神是表现得不足的，没有从群众热爱党并热望解决问题的气氛中，结束这篇小说，因此显得无力，这恐怕是一个重要的缺点。
    二、从全篇小说的进行中，我感到作者贯穿他的创作企图还是不够十分明确的，特别是代表执行政策那一方面的人物写的不够，使人很容易从软英这一面去读这篇小说，因此越读越感到不满足，这恐怕是与作者原来的创作企图完全相反的。
    三、人物的刻画，故事结构的完整性方面等技术问题缺点是较多的，要单从这方面来看，这篇小说也许还不如其他著作，但这却是一个新的尝试与跃进，作品的分量已为他丰富的内容所大大的加重了。我从树理同志一般的作品看来他似乎无论在文字作风及故事组织方面都有一种简练朴实、甚至于拘谨的作风，这篇小说是否压得太紧了，我不得而知，但好些人物如元孩对于执行政策的矛盾，对于小旦小昌的观感，小宝对于小昌的观感，支部内外的斗争，以至于软英等都未展开来写，其实小说里的这些人物都有双重矛盾心理，很可以写一写的，但我们看到的，却是要紧三关处匆匆忙忙的。提一提便走了，因此很不满足，而感到有些粗糙，假如和安发、老拐、二姨、聚财甚至于狗狗这些人物比起来，则觉得远不如他们写得亲切，这里也许还有一个生活问题，也许我们的作家对于农民的新生活还欠熟悉一些，也未可知。
    但尽管有这些缺点，“邪不压正”仍不失为极有价值的小说，现在的问题似乎是应该巩固树理同志这篇作品中已得的成绩，研究经验开展解放区的文艺运动，以迎接行将到来的伟大胜利时代，我相信在人民解放区文化的苗圃里，不久的将来，我们将看到赵树理同志更完美的作品。
