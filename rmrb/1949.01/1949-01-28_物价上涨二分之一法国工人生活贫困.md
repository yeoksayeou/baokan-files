Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. TASS dispatch:

　　True Light newspaper’s Paris correspondent, Zhukov, reports: The lives of French workers are impoverished and difficult. The gap between prices and the wages of the French working people continues to grow. In 1948, prices rose by an average of 50 percent, while wages increased by only 15 percent. As a result of the decline in the purchasing power of the working people, some goods in warehouses are piling up more and more, and factories are being forced to stop production. Since the sharp rise in the price of shoes and socks, twenty shoe and sock factories have closed down due to a sharp drop in sales, and tens of thousands of workers have become unemployed. The French General Confederation of Labor has demanded that the government and manufacturers increase wages by 25 percent, numbering as many as twelve times. The government dares not directly refuse this demand, so it adopts roundabout means. It announced its intention to "freeze" prices at the level of December 31, 1948. In addition, it guaranteed to forcibly reduce the price of certain commodities. People are extremely skeptical about this decision. The newspapers unhesitatingly called the government's plan a "great myth," and even the "Le Monde" newspaper, which rarely criticizes the government, commented that this decision was obviously intended to shelve the workers' demands completely.

　　物价上涨二分之一法国工人生活贫困
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社讯：真理报驻巴黎特派记者朱可夫报导：法国工人的生活贫穷困苦。物价与法国劳动人民工资之间的鸿沟不断增长。在一九四八年，物价平均上涨了百分之五十，而工资仅增加了百分之十五。由于劳动人民购买力下降的结果，仓库中的某些货品正越堆越多，工厂则被迫停止生产。自鞋袜价格猛涨之后，因销路骤减，二十所鞋袜工厂业已关门，上万的工人已经失业。法国总工会要求政府和制造家增加工资百分之二十五，为数达十二次。政府不敢直接拒绝这一要求，于是采取转弯抹角的手段。它宣布打算将物价“冻结”于一九四八年十二月卅一日的水平，此外，并保证强制减低某些商品的价格。人们对于这一决定极表怀疑。各报毫不踌躇地将政府的这一计划称为“大神话”，甚至很少批评政府的“世界”报也评论说：这种决定显然完全是为了搁置工人的要求。
