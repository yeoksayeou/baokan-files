Xinhua News Agency, East China, 21st: A reporter's report on the situation in Central China, north of the Yangtze River, east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and south of the Longhai Railway, states: The situation in Central China has undergone fundamental changes. Currently, Central China has become one of the most forward positions in the national liberation war to attack the enemy, and the guerrilla situation behind enemy lines, which has been heroically and arduously maintained for more than two years, has completely ended. Since the People's Liberation Army launched the Huaihai Campaign, Central China has been connected with the Shandong and Central Plains Liberated Areas, and the vast areas of Haian (north of Rugao), Gaoyou, and north of the Huai River have been completely liberated. At present, 19 cities including Huaiyin and Huaian, as well as the vast majority of rural areas, the entire coast of northern Jiangsu, and the famous Lianghuai salt fields, are under the control of the people. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits can only huddle in a few strongholds in the southern Jiangsu along the Yangtze River area, and the complete liberation of Central China is not far off. Recalling the arduous struggle of the military and civilians in Central China over the past two years, it can be divided into three periods:

The first period was the stage of adhering to the struggle behind enemy lines (from October 1946 to August 1947). The main force of the People's Liberation Army fought in the Central China region, starting with the seven consecutive victories in Central Jiangsu, and successively annihilated more than 100,000 enemies. Later, it victoriously transferred to Shandong, and from then on, Central China fully entered the situation of adhering to the enemy's rear. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits continued to invade the Shandong Liberated Area on the one hand, and concentrated more than 200,000 troops to carry out a comprehensive "suppression" in the Central China region, building pillboxes and bunkers everywhere to carry out blockades and divisions. In the coastal area south of the Hai (An) Tai (Zhou) line in central Jiangsu, which is a hundred miles long and three hundred miles wide, more than 400 strongholds were built, with pillboxes every mile on the highway, dividing our rural areas into countless small blocks less than ten miles in radius. Then, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits relied on these points and lines, using platoons and companies as units, and coordinated with local bandits and "returning home corps" to move out day and night, launching multi-pronged attacks and scattered searches, implementing frequent and continuous "encirclements," "searches," "joint suppressions," and "stationed suppressions," vainly attempting to extinguish our guerrilla units, democratic governments, and cadres who persisted in fighting in place. Coordinating with the military operations, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits carried out inhuman and brutal suppression, the so-called "three-all policy" and "bloody cleansing." According to statistics for the first year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits massacred more than 40,000 people in Central China, raped more than 100,000 women, and burned and looted countless houses and properties. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits wanted to force the people to submit with this fascist terror. At that time, a few areas retreated due to lack of combat experience or being intimidated by the immediate enemy situation, and the situation was very urgent. Therefore, the main problem at that time was "not to be intimidated, to stand firm." A "determination movement against Chiang Kai-shek" was widely launched in various places, and cadres and the masses made a life-and-death alliance, gritting their teeth and persevering in the struggle. The guerrillas who persisted behind enemy lines organized sniper groups to entangle with the enemy and launched a "cold-gun killing" campaign. Guerrilla units at all levels adopted the "enemy advances, we advance" penetrating tactics, detouring behind the large groups of enemies and inserting into the enemy's heartland to carry out guerrilla warfare, annihilating small groups of bandits, and attacking small strongholds. Under the cover of armed forces, people in various places launched a large-scale anti-Chiang Kai-shek self-defense movement. Wherever the Chiang Kai-shek bandits went, the masses emptied their houses and cleared the fields. The masses also created countless ingenious struggle methods. For example, 200,000 people in Hai (Men) Qi (Dong), under the slogan of "building death roads for the enemy and building life roads for themselves," dug up the main roads used by the enemy and built thousands of small roads and hidden dams to facilitate their own actions and fight against the enemy. In Taixing, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 65th Division, which was stationed there, was transferred north to attack Ye Ting (Yancheng), 100,000 people carried out a campaign to burn pillboxes and destroy highways, shattering the enemy's dozens of miles of blockade lines. Militiamen captured stray Chiang Kai-shek bandits, women also organized self-protection groups, and there were countless moving deeds of resisting conscription, resisting donations and taxes, resisting burning and killing, besieging strongholds, and sheltering cadres. With the enrichment of combat experience, the scale of mass struggles gradually increased, and large numbers of people joined the guerrillas, making the local armed forces continuously stronger. The guerrilla forces developed from attacking small strongholds to attacking large strongholds, and from fighting bandits to annihilating the enemy's main force. Most of the area south of the Hai (An) Tai (Zhou) line and the Jianghuai area, which had once been retreated, were restored in large pieces. After the establishment of the Northern Jiangsu and Central Jiangsu Field Corps, even more powerful offensives were launched, successively carrying out important battles such as Libao, Dazhongji, and Gaoliangjian. In total, more than 50,000 enemies were annihilated in the first period. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits were busy running around for reinforcements and gradually fell into a passive position, and their arrogance declined day by day. Wang Tiehan, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 49th Army, also admitted that the People's Liberation Army "used flexible intelligence and agile actions to focus on us. Although we have sophisticated weapons, they are no different from scrap iron. Although we have superior forces, they are no different from a mob." Our heroic Central China military and civilians finally persisted in the position on the north bank of the Yangtze River and stood firm.

The second period was a stage of both adhering to the struggle and launching a counter-offensive (from August 1947 to November 1948). When the People's Liberation Army marched into the Central Plains, the Central China Liberation Army captured Ye Ting City and annihilated a division of the remnants of the traitor Hao Pengju. From then on, Central China became a flank of the national battlefield counter-offensive. At this time, the enemy was unable to carry out a full-scale "suppression." However, because Central China was only separated from Nanjing and Shanghai by a river and its position was important, the enemy adopted a combination of "key garrison suppression" and "mobile suppression." "Stationed suppression" was carried out in some areas along the river and around important strongholds, and the central area was "swept" in turn. On the other hand, they increased their troops and organized the second "pursuit and suppression," attempting to have a decisive battle with our Central China main force. From April 1948, they implemented the so-called "military, political, and economic integration" "total war," more frantically conscripting, burning, killing, and looting, attempting to create difficulties for us and solve their own difficulties in terms of manpower and material resources. Our Central China Liberation Army launched a large-scale mobile war. When the enemy carried out the first "pursuit and suppression" with five regiments and 13,000 people, the Liberation Army annihilated more than 7,000 of them in an ambush south of Ye Ting. Then, in coordination with local armed forces at all levels, a comprehensive spring offensive was launched, capturing nearly 100 strongholds and annihilating more than 23,000 enemies within three months, disrupting the enemy's entire defense system. In April, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits shouted "Northern Jiangsu is in danger" and hurriedly transferred three armies from other areas to reinforce. Gu Zhutong personally commanded four armies to organize two "pursuit and suppression" corps, a north-south pincer, trying to annihilate our Northern Jiangsu Liberation Army on the coast. However, our Liberation Army annihilated more than 3,000 enemies in the Biancang area south of Ye Ting and then successfully transferred. When the Liberation Army launched an offensive on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits hurriedly transferred the three armies that had just been transferred away. The three cities of Funing, Ye Ting, and Shuyang, which had once been occupied, were liberated by the Liberation Army again. Then the Liberation Army launched an offensive again, recovering county towns such as Siyang and Suqian. During this period, our local armed forces at all levels also launched offensives one after another, and their combat effectiveness improved day by day, often capturing strongholds guarded by hundreds or thousands of enemies. The areas along the river still persisted in the arduous anti-"stationed suppression" and anti-"sweeping" struggles. For example, the military and civilians in the famous Sanyu cotton-producing area of Nantong persisted in the anti-cotton seizure struggle for 84 consecutive days and finally won victory. At the same time, under the call of "expanding the position," the guerrillas in various places all moved towards the marginal areas, compressing the enemy so that they dared not leave the strongholds for several miles. Under the slogan of "welcoming the great counter-offensive, participating in the main force," a large number of people joined the Liberation Army. By June 1948, 200,000 people in the Central China region had enlisted. From then on, major changes took place in the strength of the enemy and us. This was of great significance to our persistence in the struggle, coordination with the counter-offensive, and replenishment and expansion of the main force. During this period, more than 130,000 enemy troops were annihilated.

The third period is the stage of launching a counter-offensive in the Central China region and coordinating with the field army to attack the enemy (from November of last year to the present). After the Liberation Army launched the Huaihai Campaign, the situation of persistence behind enemy lines in Central China completely ended. At this time, the enemies in various places were panicked and busy fleeing. The task of the military and civilians in Central China was to fully support the front line and cooperate with the main force to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy. Hundreds of thousands of militiamen went to the front line to serve the Huaihai Campaign. Local armed forces at all levels cooperated in attacking the enemy. When the Liberation Army advanced towards the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, the masses in the Jianghuai area launched a major sabotage, cutting off the railway traffic east and south of Xuzhou. The local armed forces of Huaihai pursued and annihilated more than 3,000 pseudo-bandit salt police brigades who were fleeing from the Xinhai area to the sea, annihilating more than 2,500 of them. With the victorious impact of the Huaihai Campaign, the enemies in Huaiyin, Huaian, Baoying, Xinghua, Xuyi, and Tianchang fled one after another. Our local armed forces at all levels pursued the fleeing enemy everywhere, annihilating hundreds of enemies outside Huaiyin and Xinghua. Up to now, our local armed forces at all levels have annihilated more than 7,000 enemies. At present, the military and civilians in Central China are closely monitoring the enemy, pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy, and will fully support the main force of the Liberation Army in crossing the river to fight, carry the revolution through to the end, and fight for the liberation of all of Central China and all of China.

　　两年来华中军事形势的变化
    【新华社华东二十一日电】记者报导长江以北，津浦路以东，陇海路以南的华中地区形势称：华中形势已经起了根本变化。目前华中已成为全国解放战争进攻敌人的最前线之一，二年多来英勇地艰苦地坚持的敌后局面已经完全结束。自从解放军发动淮海攻势以后，华中已与山东、中原解放区连成一片，海安（如皋北）、高邮及淮河以北广大地区已全部解放。现淮阴、淮安等十九个城市及绝大部分的农村、苏北全部海岸和著名的两淮盐场都已为人民所掌握，蒋匪只能蜷缩在苏中沿江地区少数据点内，华中全面解放已为期不远。回忆华中军民两年来的艰苦斗争，可分为三个时期：
    第一个时期为坚持敌后斗争阶段（从一九四六年十月到一九四七年八月）。人民解放军主力，在华中地区作战，从苏中七战七捷开始，连续歼敌十余万，以后胜利地转移到山东，从此华中就全面地转入敌后坚持的局面。当时蒋匪一面继续进犯山东解放区，一面集中二十余万兵力在华中地区进行全面“清剿”，到处构筑梅花桩据点与碉堡，进行封锁分割。单在苏中海（安）泰（州）线南纵百里横三百里的沿江地区，就筑有据点四百余处，公路上一里一碉堡，将我农村分割成无数个方圆不足十里的小块。然后蒋匪又依靠这些点线，以排、连为单位，配合地方土匪“还乡团”日夜出动，多路合击，分散搜索，实行频繁的持续的“兜剿”、“搜索”、“会剿”、“驻剿”，妄想扑灭我坚持原地斗争的游击队、民主政府和干部。蒋匪配合着军事行动的是惨无人性的残暴镇压，所谓“三光政策”、“血洗清剿”。据第一年统计，蒋匪在华中屠杀了四万多人民，强奸妇女达十余万，烧毁房屋抢劫财物不计其数。蒋匪想以这种法西斯的恐怖行动，逼迫人民屈服。当时有少数地区由于缺乏斗争经验或被当面敌情所吓倒而退却，情势非常紧急。因此，当时主要的问题在“不被吓倒，站稳脚跟”。各地普遍开展了“反蒋决心运动”，干部与群众都立生死同盟，咬紧牙关坚持斗争。坚持在敌后的游击队组织起狙击组与敌纠缠，开展“冷枪杀敌”运动。各级游击队采取“敌进我进”的穿心战术，绕到大股出动敌人的背后，插到敌人心脏地区去打游击，歼灭小股土匪，进攻小据点。在武装掩护下，各地人民掀起了大规模的反蒋自卫运动，蒋匪到那里，那里的群众就空舍清野。群众并创造了无数巧妙的斗争办法，例如：海（门）启（东）二十万群众在“替敌人造死路”、“替自己造生路”的口号下，挖掉敌人行走的大路，筑起上千条便利自己行动的小路、暗坝，与敌人斗争。泰兴十万群众趁驻防蒋匪整六十五师北调进攻叶挺（盐城）时，进行烧碉堡、破公路运动，将敌人几十里封锁线一下破坏得七零八落。民兵捕捉掉队蒋匪，妇女亦组织保身小组，还有无数反抓丁、反捐税、反烧杀、围困据点、掩护干部等可歌可泣的动人事迹。随着斗争经验的丰富，群众斗争的规模逐渐巨大，大批群众参加游击队，使地方武装不断壮大。游击部队从打小据点发展到打大据点，从打土匪发展到歼灭敌主力，一度退守的海（安）泰（州）线南大部地区及江淮地区都先后大块恢复。苏北、苏中野战兵团成立后，更展开了强大的攻势，陆续进行了李堡、大中集、高良涧等重要战役，总计第一个时期歼敌五万余人。蒋匪忙于奔波增援，逐渐陷入被动，气焰一天天低落。蒋匪四十九军军长王铁汉也承认人民解放军“以灵活之情报，机敏之行动，全神对我，我虽有精良之武装无异废铁，虽有优势兵力，亦无异乌合”。我英勇的华中军皿终于坚持了长江北岸阵地，屹立不动。
    第二个时期是一面坚持斗争一面举行反攻的阶段（从一九四七年八月起到一九四八年十一月）。当解放军进军中原时，华中解放军打下叶挺城，歼灭郝逆鹏举残部一个师，从此华中就成为全国战场反攻的一个侧翼。这时敌人无力进行全力“清剿”。但因华中与京沪仅一江之隔，地位重要，因此敌人一面采取了“重点驻剿”与“机动清剿”相结合的办法，在沿江部分地区及重要据点周围进行“驻剿”，并轮番“扫荡”我中心区，一面又增调兵力组织了二次“追剿”，企图与我华中主力决战。一九四八年四月起又实行所谓“军政经合一”的“总体战”，更疯狂的抓丁、烧杀、抢劫，企图制造我之困难，解决其兵力物力之困难。而我华中解放军则展开了大规模的运动战。当敌人以五个团一万三千人进行第一次“追剿”时，解放军在叶挺南一个伏击就歼灭其七千余。接着又配合各级地方武装进行了全面的春季攻势，三个月内打下近百个据点，歼敌二万三千余人，打乱了敌人整个防御体系。四月里蒋匪高喊“苏北危急”，慌忙从其他地区调来三个军增援，顾匪祝同并亲自指挥四个军兵力，组织南北两个“追剿”兵团，南北合击，想歼灭我苏北解放军于海边。但我解放军又在叶挺南卞仓一带歼敌三千余后胜利地转移。当解放军于津浦线开展攻势时，蒋匪又将刚调来之三个军仓皇调走一度被侵占的阜宁、叶挺、沭阳三城又被解放军解放；接着解放军又展开攻势，收复泗阳、宿迁等县城。这一时期我各级地方武装又纷纷出击，战斗力一天天提高，经常攻克有数百个或数千个敌人据守的据点。沿江地区则仍然坚持艰苦之反“驻剿”、反“扫荡”斗争，如著名之南通三余产棉区军民，接连坚持了八十四天的反抢棉斗争，终于取得胜利。同时在“扩大阵地”的号召下，各地游击队都挺向边缘地区，把敌人压缩得不敢离据点数里。在“迎接大反攻，参加主力军”的口号下，大批人民参加解放军。到一九四八年六月为止，华中地区已有二十万人民入伍。从此敌我双方的力量发生重大变化。这对我坚持斗争，配合反攻，充实与扩大主力军都有重大意义。在这一时期共歼敌军十三万余人。
    第三个时期是在华中地区举行反攻并配合野战军向敌进攻的阶段（从去年十一月至今）。解放军发动淮海战役后，华中敌后的坚持局面就完全结束。这时各地敌人惊慌万状，忙于逃窜。华中军民的任务是全力支援前线，配合主力追歼逃敌。数十万民兵开赴前线，为淮海战役服务。各级地方武装配合着出击敌人。当解放军向陇海东段进击时，江淮地区群众展开大破击，切断了徐州以东及以南的铁路交通。淮海地方武装追击由新海地区向海上逃跑之伪匪盐警大队三千余人，歼灭其二千五百余人。随着淮海战役的胜利影响，淮阴、淮安、宝应、兴化、盱眙、天长等地敌人相继逃窜，我各级地方武装到处追击逃敌，在淮阴、兴化外围各歼敌数百名。到目前为止，我各级地方武装已歼敌达七千余名。现华中军民正严密监视敌人，追歼逃敌，并将全力支援解放军主力渡江作战，将革命进行到底，为解放全华中、全中国而斗争。
