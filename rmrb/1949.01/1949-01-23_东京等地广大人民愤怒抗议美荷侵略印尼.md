Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Reports from various sources indicate that the crimes of the United States and Britain in supporting the Netherlands' slaughter of the Indonesian people continue to be opposed by the broad masses of people around the world. On the 13th of this month, representatives of overseas Chinese from various oppressed Asian nations residing in Japan held a grand protest demonstration in Tokyo. The flags of various oppressed countries and slogans against imperialist aggression were displayed on the streets of Tokyo. Representatives from Indonesia, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Korea, in "fiery" speeches, vehemently criticized the imperialist countries' attempts to re-enslave the people of the East, and compared the current acts of aggression committed by "Western" imperialists to the crimes of Tojo, who was recently hanged. The meeting unanimously demanded that the Security Council make a "clear resolution" to stop Dutch aggression. In Tehran, the Iranian Masses Party published a statement on the 14th in its newspaper from the Central Committee of the party regarding the situation in Indonesia, pointing out that when American imperialism—the instigator of the current Indonesian events—acts as a mediator, this "mediation" is completely hypocritical and deceptive. While analyzing the discord between the United States and Britain on the issue of dividing the spoils, the statement emphasized: "All these hypocrites are united in their determination to enslave the Indonesian people." The Dutch Communist Party's organ, "De Waarheid," recently published many letters from Dutch anti-war soldiers sent from Indonesia, protesting the inhumane atrocities committed by Dutch imperialism against the Indonesian people. One contributor stated: "The roads in the Tasekmalaya area are impassable, blocked by the rotting corpses of countless Indonesians shot by the Dutch army. In the Hemidang area, the Dutch army razed all the villages to the ground and exterminated the local residents. This horrific sight is unbearable to witness." The contributor had witnessed Dutch authorities shooting Indonesian prisoners of war. In its commentary, "De Waarheid" warned that the Drees government should bear full responsibility for every crime committed in Indonesia.

　　东京等地广大人民愤怒抗议美荷侵略印尼
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报导：美英支持荷兰屠杀印尼人民的罪行，继续遭受世界广大人民群众的反对。本月十三日，旅居日本的亚洲各被压迫民族的侨民代表，在东京举行了盛大的抗议示威。各被压迫国家的国旗与反对帝国主义侵略的标语，展现于东京街头。印尼、中国、越南、菲律宾与朝鲜的代表，在“烈火一般”的演说中，猛烈抨击帝国主义国家重新奴役东方人民的企图，并将“西方”帝国主义者目前所犯的侵略罪行，与不久前被处绞刑的东条的罪状相比拟。会议一致要求安理会对制止荷兰的侵略作出“明确的决议”。在德黑兰，伊朗群众党十四日在报上发表该党中央委员会对印尼情势的声明，指出：当美帝国主义——它是目前印尼事件的煽动者——充当调解人的角色时，这种“调处”便完全是虚伪与欺骗。该声明在分析美英于分赃问题上的龃龉时，强调指出：“所有这些伪君子在决心奴役印尼人民这一点上，是团结一致的”。荷兰共产党机关报“德·瓦尔海”最近发表荷兰反战士兵自印尼寄出的许多信件，抗议荷帝对印尼人民所犯的残无人性的暴行。投书人之一称：“塔斯克马莱地区的道路，已由被荷军枪杀之无数印尼人的腐烂尸体所阻而不能通行。在赫米当地区，荷军将一切村庄践为平地，并灭绝当地居民。这种可怖的景象惨不忍睹”。投书人曾目睹荷当局枪杀印尼战俘。“德·瓦尔海”报在评论中警告称：德里斯政府应负在印尼所犯的每一罪行的完全责任。
