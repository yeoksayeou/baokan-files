　　Arab Countries—Refers to the seven countries in the Middle East: Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Transjordan. The majority of the residents in these seven countries are Arabs, hence the name Arab Countries.
　　Israel—The name of a country. According to the United Nations Security Council's decision on the Palestine issue on November 29, 1947, Palestine was to be divided into two countries, one for Arabs and one for Jews. The Jews, in accordance with this reasonable decision, formally established a country on May 14th of last year, named Israel. It occupies more than half of Palestine's area, approximately one-eighth of Jiangsu Province. Its territory (as decided by the UN Partition Plan) consists of three parts: one is the Negev region in southern Palestine, another is the Galilee region in northeastern Palestine, and the third is a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, extending from Haifa in the north to Port Isdud in the south. It has about 600,000 Jews. The capital is Tel Aviv, located on the Mediterranean coast, 35 miles northwest of Jerusalem.
　　Palestine Committee—When the United Nations Security Council discussed the Palestine issue, it passed (with a slim majority of twenty-five votes to twenty-one votes, with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries opposing) the organization and establishment of this committee. This proposal, put forward by Canada, involves selecting three member states from the five powers (Soviet Union, United States, Britain, France, and "China") to form a committee to mediate the Palestine issue, taking over the work of the "United Nations Mediator for Palestine" Count Bernadotte, who violated the UN General Assembly resolution (Bernadotte, entrusted by Britain and the United States, played tricks with "federation" and "peace talks" in an attempt to cancel Israel's independence and help Arab armies invade Israel), to "assist" both the Jewish and Arab sides in resolving all disputes. But in reality, because this committee is composed of member states appointed by the US, Britain, France, and "China," which are among the five powers intentionally undermining the principle of national self-determination, it not only cannot genuinely resolve the Arab-Jewish disputes, but on the contrary, it is a tool used by Britain and the United States to secure their oil rights in Palestine.

    阿拉伯国家——是指中东的埃及、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、叶门和外约坦七国。在这七国内的居民都是阿拉伯人较多，故称为阿拉伯国家。
    以色列——国家的名字。根据一九四七年十一月二十九日联合国安理会对巴勒斯坦问题的决定，就是将巴勒斯坦分成阿拉伯人和犹太人的两个国家，犹太人就按照这个合理的决定，于去年五月十四日正式组成国家，起名为以色列。它据有巴勒斯坦一半以上的面积，约等于江苏省的八分之一。它的领土（联大分治决定）有三块，其一是巴勒斯坦南部的内革布区，另一是巴勒斯坦东北部的加利里区，还有一块是西沿地中海、北起海法、南至伊斯德港的一块狭长地区，共有六十万左右的犹太人，首都为特拉维夫，濒地中海岸，在耶路撒冷西北三十五哩。
    巴勒斯坦委员会——联合国安理会讨论巴勒斯坦问题时，以微小的多数——二十五票对二十一票（苏联及新民主国家反对），通过组织成立，此案由加拿大提出由五强（苏、美、英、法、“中”）中挑选三个会员国组成调解巴勒斯坦问题的委员会，接收违反联大决议的“联合国巴勒斯坦调解专员”伯纳杜特的工作（伯纳杜特受英美之托曾玩弄“联邦”、“和谈”的把戏，图取消以色列的独立和帮助阿拉伯军队侵略以色列），以“协助”犹阿双方解决一切纠纷。但实际上，因为这个委员会是由有意破坏民族自决原则的五强中的美、英、法、“中”所指派的会员国组成，所以不但不能真正解决阿犹纠纷，相反地，却是英美利用来取得他们在巴勒斯坦的石油权利的一个工具。
