　　Yangquan Public Coal Mine Improves Equipment
  　Daily Output Exceeds Pre-War Levels by Twofold
    Striving to Increase Daily Output to Two Thousand Tons
    [Our Dispatch] The coal mining industry in Yangquan City has experienced tremendous development in the past nine months. The four public coal mines produce over eight hundred tons daily. After the unification of the four mines and the Ping Shun Mine under unified management, the ventilation system was further improved. In particular, since the beginning of winter, the mine has replaced some manpower with oxen power on the light railways for pushing carts both inside and outside the pits. Furthermore, a 700-meter-long electric-powered steel cable circulating rope was installed on the large wooden bridge between the Fourth and Second mines, which greatly increased the transport capacity. The mine now has 1,600 employees, and the daily output has increased from 149 tons in April of last year to over 600 tons by the end of last year, more than double the pre-war level. The Pingji Mine currently has 270 workers, and the daily output has gradually increased from 66 tons in June of last year to the current 140 tons. Secondly, the two medium-sized public mines, Yuhua and Yumin, which employ a total of 140 workers using indigenous mining methods, have also increased their combined daily output to over 100 tons. In addition, the total daily output of 14 medium-sized private mines has now risen to 300 tons. According to statistics, the city originally had 152 mine shafts (including 8 large mines, 30 medium-sized mines, and the rest small coal kilns). Currently, 111 of them have resumed operation (including 2 large mines, 14 medium-sized mines, and the rest small coal kilns), employing approximately 3,000 miners. The total daily output is 1,600 tons, of which 600 tons are used locally for burning, and the remainder is transported by train to other provinces and sold well in Jinnan, Henan, and Jinan, Shandong. According to statistics from Yangquan Railway Station, from the time the Yangde Railway line opened to traffic in June of last year to December, the city transported a total of 118,400 tons of large coal to other provinces. In December of last year, an average of 1,171 tons were transported out daily. Currently, the city's public mines still have over 100,000 tons of coal in stock, waiting to be transported. In addition, various mines are stepping up production, striving to increase the daily output to 2,000 tons starting from January of this year. To adapt to the current development situation, the Jing(xing) Yang(quan) Coal Industry Company has drafted a major plan to reopen the new Third Mine and the existing four public mines in Yangquan City, gradually increasing the daily output to 3,100 tons by the end of this year.

　　阳泉公营煤矿改进设备
  　日产量超过战前两倍
    争取每日输出量提高到两千吨
    【本报讯】阳泉市煤矿业，近九个月来有巨大发展。四个公营煤矿日产八百余吨。四矿与平顺矿统一经营后，更好的改善了风道；特别是该矿于入冬以来，在坑内外平推车的轻便铁道上，改用一部分牛力，继又在四矿与二矿的大木桥上，设置了长达七百米使用电力推动的钢丝循环绳，更大大的增加了搬运力。该矿现有一千六百名职工，每日产量由去年四月的一四九吨，提高到去年年底的六百余吨，已超过抗战前的两倍多。平济矿现有二百七十名工人，日产量从去年六月份的六十六吨，逐渐增至现在的一百四十吨。其次是共有一百四十名工人的裕华、裕民两个土法开采的中等公营矿，日产量亦共提高到百吨以上。另外十四个中等私营矿，总日产量现已上升到三百吨。按该市原有矿窑一五二座（内大矿八座，中等矿三十座，其余为小煤窑）。现已恢复开采者，计达“一一一座（内大矿二座，中等矿十四座，其余为小煤窑），约有三千余名矿工，总日产量为一千六百吨，除本地烧用六百吨外，其余皆有火车运往外省，畅销冀南、河南、山东济南各地。据阳泉车站统计，自去年六月阳德线通车起至十二月为止，该市向外省运出大炭共计十一万八千四百吨。去年十二月份，平均每日运出一一七一吨。现该市公营矿尚存煤十万余吨，需待运出。加之各矿正在加紧增产，争取自本年一月份后，每日输出量提高到两千吨。为适应当前形势发展，井（陉）阳（泉）煤业公司，已拟就重开新三矿及现有之阳泉市四个公营矿，至今年底将日产量逐渐提高到三千一百吨的巨大计划。　　　　　　　　　　　（吕光明）
