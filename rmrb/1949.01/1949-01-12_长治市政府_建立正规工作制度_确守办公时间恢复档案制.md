　　Changzhi Municipal Government
  　Establishes Formal Work System
  　Ensures Office Hours, Restores Archive System
    [Reported by this newspaper] Under the slogan of "work regularization" and "strengthening work efficiency," the Changzhi Municipal Government specifically discussed and studied the establishment of an agency work system in December. The system's internal regulations stipulate:
    (1) The office hours for each section and department are two hours of study every morning and seven hours of work. During working hours, no visitors are allowed, and no one is allowed to leave their post without permission. On Sundays and holidays, a duty roster system is adopted (under the leadership of the duty section chief).
    (2) Establishment of an archive system: The Municipal Government Secretariat will uniformly issue more standardized file covers and manuscript books, uniformly numbered and distributed to each section for use. It is also stipulated that after each section reports work to higher levels or organizes summary materials, in addition to each section retaining a copy for filing, a copy must be submitted to the Secretariat for record-keeping, overcoming the past guerrilla habits of "when the person is there, the work is there" and "when the person leaves, the work leaves," with no materials or archives.
    (3) Establishment of a leave system: Municipal government cadres (with families in this city) are not allowed to stay overnight outside of Saturdays and Sundays when they can go home. Private matters should be resolved on Sundays and should not encroach on working hours. Municipal government cadres (whose families live in other counties) should not take more than one month of leave within a year.
    To facilitate the inspection and supervision of work, the Municipal Government has also established a work meeting system. Every Wednesday and Saturday is a section chief liaison meeting, where each section chief will concisely present the work and problems of each section for discussion and resolution, and report on the week's work to the mayor to strengthen leadership.

　　长治市政府
  　建立正规工作制度
  　确守办公时间恢复档案制
    【本报讯】在“工作正规化”、“加强工作效率”的口号下，长治市政府特于十二月份内讨论研究建立了机关工作制度，制度通行内规定：
    （一）各科各部门办公时间，每日早晨学习两小时，办公七小时，在工作时间内，一律不准会客，亦不得随便擅离职守，礼拜日假日采值日轮班制（受值日科长的领导）。
    （二）建立档案制：由市府秘书室统一印发较正规的卷宗皮与稿文簿等，并统一编号分发各科使用，并规定各科在向上级报告工作、或整理总结材料后，除各科留一份存案外，必须交秘书室一份，以便存查，克服过去那种“人在工作在”、“人走工作走”，没有材料、档案的游击习气。
    （三）建立请假制度：市府干部（有家在本市者）除去礼拜六、礼拜日可回家住宿外，其余一律不得外宿，私事应在礼拜日解决，不得侵占工作时间，市府干部（家住外县者）一年内，请假不得超过一个月时间。
    为便于工作的检查、督促，市府又建立工作会议制，每礼拜三、礼拜六为科长接头会，由各科科长将各科的工作与问题，扼要的提出讨论解决。并向市长作一周工作的报告，以便加强领导。
