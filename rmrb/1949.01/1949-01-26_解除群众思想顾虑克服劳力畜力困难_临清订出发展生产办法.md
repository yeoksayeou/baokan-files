　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to actively prepare for this year's major production push, Linqing County, Jinnan, has carefully studied the existing problems in production and formulated specific solutions. The first problem is that some cadres ideologically neglect leading production, thinking that production is the farmers' own business, that everyone knows how to do it, and that there is no need for leadership; or that land reform has been completed and they can take a break; and a few cadres, because of personal gains and losses, are passive in their work, and naturally are not enthusiastic about production. On the part of the masses, because a portion of middle peasants were wrongly struggled against in the past land reform movement, some people still have concerns about getting rich through production; and hold the idea of "eat a little, don't save" (these people are mostly landlords, rich peasants, or well-to-do middle peasants who have been struggled against). Second, there is a lack of farm implements. According to a survey in the tenth district, there is a particular shortage of large carts. For example, Lai Zhai Village had 14 large carts before the War of Resistance, but now only has two, causing constant disputes in the village over the use of carts. Third, there is a shortage of livestock. In the past, farmers bought and fed livestock together, and often failed to pay timely attention to feeding, resulting in illness and death. For example, recently in the tenth and seventh districts, cattle have suffered from gastrointestinal diseases, resulting in numerous deaths. Some households lacking livestock are unable to purchase them. Fourth, the labor burden is unbalanced. Some people cannot engage in production due to excessive corvée labor; others feed cattle but cannot use them themselves. Fifth, there is a lack of labor. In some villages, each laborer has to cultivate 36 mu of land. Sixth, some areas were cruelly robbed, burned, and killed by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance, and then suffered from natural disasters, so their vitality could not be restored. For example, more than ten villages such as Dong and Xi Guoqi Zhai and Hu Guanzhuang in the eighth district are like this; also, twenty-eight villages such as Shuibo and Gaoao in the fifth district have saline-alkali soil that is barren, constantly flooded, and severely devastated by the enemy, so the masses lack food and clothing; the third, sixth, ninth, and tenth districts each also have a portion of sandy alkali land villages. In Wei Luo An in the ninth district, because the fields are full of saline-alkali, residents cannot find wives for their sons, and the population is gradually decreasing. It is very difficult to carry out large-scale production in these areas that have not recovered their vitality or were originally extremely poor. Seventh, poor and hired peasants have obtained land through land reform, but because of poor harvests, they cannot eat enough grain until spring. The flooded areas are even more difficult. Eighth, insect pests and floods have not yet been effectively overcome. Ninth, in recent years, not enough attention has been paid to preferential treatment for military families, and the crops of elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed military dependents and martyrs' families have not grown well, resulting in difficult living conditions for some military families. Tenth, farmers lack funds for sideline production, and the lending relationship in the villages has stagnated since the land reform.
    The above problems are obstacles in the large-scale agricultural production movement. But generally speaking, today the county's land reform has been basically completed, and the vast number of working people have obtained land, production tools, draught animals, food, clothing, and other items. They have the enthusiasm to get rich through production. Under the leadership and promotion of the vast number of liberated peasants, it will stimulate the enthusiasm of the middle peasants for production. At the same time, most of the landlords and rich peasants who have undergone land reform have participated in labor, increasing the rural productive forces. With these basic conditions, coupled with the favorable situation of the war increasingly approaching national victory, any difficulties can be overcome one by one. Under the general policy of organizing all the county's manpower, animal power, and financial resources to invest in production, the county government has formulated various specific solutions to the above problems: (1) Carry out production education for general cadres, explaining that the ultimate goal of land reform is to develop production. Make them understand that the vast number of peasants have just turned over from the long-term oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, and face numerous difficulties, urgently needing to lead them in production to get rich. Conduct ideological education for cadres who are concerned about personal gains and losses and have passive ideas, and call on them to establish prestige in production and not be abandoned by the masses; focus on publicizing to the masses who have ideological concerns that land reform has been completed, and after the land certificate is issued, the land belongs to the individual, and they have the freedom to sell, rent, and transfer it, and no one may infringe on it. Call on everyone to plan for the long term, save on production, and get rich. (2) Agricultural tool problem: First of all, it is determined to protect and repair existing agricultural tools. For daily necessities such as manure baskets, iron shovels, manure forks, plows, and shares, it is advocated to buy them together, buy them yourself, or exchange them for use; but borrowing or exchanging must be voluntary, and forced is prohibited. It is advocated to buy large carts together, and the government provides loans to solve the problem; promote the method of rotating the use of various manufactured parts, and oppose destructive behavior such as only using without repairing or not oiling the carts. Secondly, actively improve agricultural tools: it is advocated to use two-pronged cultivators instead of three-pronged cultivators for easy weeding, and the government has decided to open a carpentry shop to experiment with reforming the method of cultivators; and it is advocated to use weeding hoes, and to modify existing weeding hoes into live-card type, which can be used at will in the furrows of three-pronged and two-pronged cultivators, which saves labor; it is advocated to use furrow plows for plowing, which is convenient for small farmers to operate, saves effort and can deep plow. The government will open factories for making cultivators, making furrow plows, and making weeding hoes, and hire technicians to specialize in manufacturing. (3) Livestock problem: For areas where vitality has not recovered, the government will issue livestock loans, and the government's livestock and breeding cattle will be placed in these areas in a planned manner. In ordinary areas, measures should be taken to protect and massively breed livestock: it is stipulated that all livestock will not bear the burden and will be deducted from the tax exemption point; newly purchased cattle will not be used for corvée labor for three months, and livestock sold and breeding cattle of the government will not be used for corvée labor. Strictly implement the regulations for the protection of livestock stipulated by the administrative office for pregnant or newly born livestock. It is strictly forbidden to slaughter cattle. In order to avoid livestock diseases and deaths, hold veterinary symposiums or training classes to study prevention and treatment methods; and introduce them to the villages. Solve the problem of livestock feed, advocate planting alfalfa in large quantities, plant one mu of alfalfa in ten mu or more of land, and the alfalfa land will not be subject to burden in the first year. (4) The problem of lack of labor: First of all, start with the rational adjustment of the burden of corvée labor. Counties and districts with areas where vitality has not recovered and too many people participating in the war should be taken care of, and corvée labor should be appropriately reduced or exempted. Villages with too little labor can be designated as corvée-free villages after being approved by the county. Secondly, we should vigorously promote women's participation in agricultural labor and save civilian labor. Each district and village should formulate a labor burden booklet by means of mass self-reporting and public discussion. Announce the list of corvée labor according to the season, and strive for fairness. (5) For areas with saline-alkali barrenness and unrecovered vitality, in addition to the government issuing livestock loans to directly assist, it also advocates accumulating fertilizer in large quantities, calling on every household to set up manure pits, compost manure, and women and children to sweep and accumulate ash and soil, and preserve urine, to make up for the barrenness of the soil. (6) For insect pests: First of all, we should educate the masses to recognize their harm and break the superstitious ideas of "God insects are not called to fight" or "the more you fight, the more there are." It is advocated to report any disaster, and everyone will fight it, and insect pests can be avoided. (7) Repair canals and open dikes to prevent floods. It is decided to repair the section of the Yellow River dike from the north of Linqing City to Xiajin according to the river defense bureau's plan, and thicken it by one-third, and specially process dangerous works. In order to complete the project quickly, it is decided to extract 100,000 catties of local grain as work relief. (8) Military dependents and martyrs' families: It is decided that all poor military dependents and martyrs' families with no labor at home will be cultivated on their behalf, and fixed households will be designated to cultivate on their behalf. If necessary, exchange one mu of the crops of the person cultivating on behalf of them for one mu of the same quality land of the military dependents and martyrs' families. In order to prevent insincere cultivation on behalf of them. (Editor's note: It is not a fundamental solution to start by fundamentally raising the awareness of the masses, but to use this palliative method.) (9) The problem of funds for rural sideline businesses: Open rural credit cooperatives and encourage the masses to borrow and lend freely. Interest rates are self-determined. The bank also plans to subsidize some sideline productions such as textile, towel weaving, etc.

　　解除群众思想顾虑克服劳力畜力困难
  　临清订出发展生产办法
    【本报讯】冀南临清县为了积极准备今年大生产，特仔细研究目前生产中所存在的问题，并订出具体解决办法。第一个问题，是一些干部在思想上忽视领导生产，以为生产是农民自己的事，谁都会，不用领导；或以为土地改革已经完成，可以歇一歇；更有少数干部，因计较个人得失，工作消极，对生产自然也不积极。在群众方面，因为过去土改运动中曾错斗了一部分中农，有的人对生产发家仍有顾虑；存着“有点吃点别存留”的想法（这些人多是被斗争后的地主、富农或富裕中农）。第二、农具缺乏，据十区的调查，特别缺乏大车。如来砦村抗战前有大车十四辆，现只有二辆，全村为使车常闹纠纷。第三、牲口缺乏，过去农民伙买伙喂牲口，常因喂养上不能及时注意而病死。如十、七区近来发生牛肠胃病，死者颇多。有的缺牲口户尚无力购买。第四、劳力负担不平衡，有的人因支差过多不能从事生产；有的喂了牛而不能自己用。第五、劳动力缺乏，有的村每个劳力要种三十六亩地。第六、有的地区在抗战时期被日寇残酷抢劫、烧杀，又遭灾荒袭击，致元气不能恢复。如八区东、西郭七砦、胡官庄等十余村庄即如此；又如五区水波、高凹等二十八村地质盐碱不毛，常年水淹，又被敌人严重摧残，群众缺衣缺食；三、六、九、十区亦各有一部沙碱地村，九区的卫罗庵，因遍野盐碱，居民生男孩娶不到媳妇，户口日渐减少。象这些元气未恢复或本来就极穷苦的地方，进行大生产存在着很大困难。第七、贫雇农经过土地改革得到了土地，但因歉收，粮食吃不到春天。水淹区更为困难。第八、虫害、水灾仍未有效的克服。第九、近年来对优军工作不够注意，老弱孤寡军烈属的庄稼都长得不好，致有的军属生活困难。第十、农民的副业生产缺乏资金，村中的借贷关系土改以来又已停滞。
    以上这些问题，是开展农业大生产运动中的障碍。但总的说来，今天全县土地改革已基本完成，广大劳动人民都得到了土地、生产工具、耕畜、食粮、衣被等物，他们有着发家致富的生产热情，在广大翻身农民的带头推动下，会刺激起中农热心生产。同时经过土改后的地主、富农大部分已参加劳动增加了农村的生产力。有了这些基本条件，加上战争日益接近全国胜利的有利形势，无论什么困难都可以一一克服。该县县府对上述问题，在组织全县人力、畜力、财力全部投入生产的总方针下，具体定出各种解决办法：（一）对一般干部展开生产教育，说明土地改革的最终目的就是为了发展生产。使他们了解，广大农民群众才从地主阶级的长期压迫剥削下翻过身来，困难重重，急需领导他们生产，发家致富。对计较个人得失，思想消极的干部，进行思想教育，号召他们在生产中树立威信，不为群众所遗弃；对有思想顾虑的群众，着重宣传土地改革已经完成，颁发土地证后土地即归个人所有，有变卖、租佃、转让的自由，任何人不得侵犯。号召大家长期打算、节约生产、发家致富。（二）农具问题：首先确定对现有农具加以保护与修理。日常必需用具如粪筐、铁锨、粪枚、犁、铧等，提倡伙买、自购或调换使用；但借用或换用必须出于自愿，禁止强迫。提倡伙买大车，政府并贷款解决；发扬各制零件轮流使用的办法，反对光使不修理或使车子不上油的破坏行为。其次是积极改良农具：提倡使二角耧代替三角耧便于耘锄，政府决定专开一木匠铺，试验改造耧的办法；并提倡使用耘锄，并将现有耘锄改成活卡式的，可以在三角与二角耧中垄内随便用，又省工；提倡使耠子犁地，便于小农经营，省劲又可深耕。政府将开办打耧、造耠子、制耘锄工厂，聘请技师专门制造。（三）牲口问题：对元气未恢复地区，由政府发放牲畜贷款，并将政府的牲畜、种牛有计划地放到此等地区。对普通地区采取保护与大量繁殖牲畜办法：规定一切牲畜不负担并扣除免征点；新买的牛三个月不支差，贩卖的牲口及政府的种牛不支差。对怀孕或初生的牲口严格实行行署规定的保护牲畜条例。严禁宰杀耕牛。为避免牲口病、死，召开兽医座谈会或训练班，研究防疫及治疗办法；并向各村介绍。解决牲口饲料，提倡大量种苜蓿，十亩以上的地种一亩苜蓿，苜蓿地第一年不纳负担。（四）劳动力缺乏问题；首先从负担支差的合理调整方面着手，对元气未恢复及参战人数过多的地区、县、区应加以照顾，适当减免支差。劳力太缺乏的村庄经县批准后，可定为禁差村。其次，应大力提倡妇女参加农业劳动及节约民力，各区村应以群众自报公议的办法订出劳力负担册子。按季节公布支差名单，力求公允。（五）盐碱不毛、元气未复地区，除政府发放牲畜贷款直接扶助外，并提倡大量积肥，号召家家设粪坑、沤粪，妇女儿童扫积灰土，保存便尿，以补救土质的贫脊。（六）对于虫害：首先应教育群众认识其危害性，破除“神虫不叫打”或“越打越多”的迷信思想。提倡有灾必报，大家去打，虫害即可免除。（七）修渠开堤以防止水患，决定根据河防局计划，将临清市北到夏津一段黄河堤加以修理，培厚三分之一，对险工要特别加工。为了工程迅速完成，决定抽出十万斤地方粮以工代赈。（八）军烈属问题：决定家无劳力之穷苦军、烈属全部代耕，并固定代耕户。必要时以代耕人的一亩庄稼和军、烈属的同质地的一亩调换。以防止不真心代耕。（编者按：不从根本提高群众觉悟着手，而用这种治标办法，是不解决问题的。）（九）农村副业的资金问题：开设农村信用合作社，提倡群众自由借贷。利息自订。银行并有计划地资助一部分生产副业如纺织、织毛巾等。
