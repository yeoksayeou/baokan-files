"Breakthrough? That's a Dream!"
　　On the evening of the seventh of last month, Zhangjiakou was heavily surrounded by our army. The bandit troops of Fu Zuoyi, facing imminent death, were attempting to open a gap at all costs to escape. On the morning of the ninth, they cobbled together half of the garrison forces (two infantry divisions, one thousand cavalry) and launched a fierce attack with four regiments on our army's position west of Ningyuanbao and east of the Qing Shui River. This was the position of the Third Battalion of one of our units. The terrain in front of the position was undulating, with the banks of the dried-up canals covered with pruned branches. All the commanders and fighters of the Third Battalion understood: the position must not be lost; this was a battle of responsibility to the Party and the people; it concerned the early or late liberation of North China. They tensely glared at the front. At this moment, the enemy's dense forces charged up. The soldiers calmly shouted "Fire!" when the enemy came within twenty meters, raising the snacks prepared for the bandits—hand grenades—and throwing them. They flew through the air like countless black meteors, blooming one by one in front of the enemy. At the same time, several machine guns also "wa-wa" yelled; a sudden rainstorm swept the enemy back, crawling and rolling.
　　How could the enemy be willing to give up? In less than five minutes, the trembling bandits were driven up again by the supervising team with guns. The soldiers laughed in their hearts, "These pigs!" At the same time, they pulled the pins of the hand grenades and held them tightly in their palms. This time, the fraternal units also assisted, and several machine guns hidden in the branches laughed and shot at the enemy, who twisted, jumped, and staggered, falling to the ground one by one. The dust raised by the hand grenades buried the corpses of the dogs.
　　Although repeatedly defeated, the enemy still did not give up its determination to break through and escape. Then, the third time, the fourth time... like waves, they attacked. Of course, each time the enemy fell in rows, but our brave comrades also gradually decreased. In this way, a small but tenacious force fiercely resisted an enemy more than ten times its size; when there were fewer people, they spread out; when there were no bullets, they fought with bayonets. All the commanders and fighters, in the short-range bayonet fighting across the canal, repelled the enemy's successive charges.
　　At three o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy organized the last charge. Like a black mass of crows in a wheat field, they surged up. The enemy covered with the most intense firepower. With the disparity in strength, the soldiers moved, and the enemy took the opportunity to climb up. The Third Battalion's position was gradually eroded. "Charge! Comrades! Take back the position!" Who shouted fiercely? Seeing Huang Shutian, the Communist Party member and Third Company Commander, who had been wounded in three places but refused to leave the front line, picked up his gun with a bayonet, stood up, and charged forward. Then Dong Zhiming also charged forward, charged forward, one, one... the entire Third Battalion charged forward. When the bullets were gone, they used bayonets. When the bayonets were bent, they replaced them with one from the enemy's hand, bent down and pulled a hand grenade from the enemy's corpse and threw it violently. Fight! Charge! Finally, the Third Battalion bravely drove away the enemy and recovered its original position. The enemy's fantasy of breaking through was also annihilated along with the more than one hundred and seventy corpses left behind. Eating dinner, one soldier said, "Breakthrough? As long as I have a breath left, you Fu Zuoyi don't even think about it."
　　When the sun set, several white lights rose into the sky above the Yang River, which was the signal for our army's general attack. The artillery roared in response.

　　"Fine Wine for Heroes"
　　In the combat mobilization to annihilate the main force of Fu bandit's Thirty-fifth Army in Xinbaoan, the First Battalion of a certain unit of the Liberation Army created the mobilization method of "Fine Wine for Heroes." All companies in the battalion gave a chicken to the "Spearhead Company," which was assigned the glorious task of assault. In addition to a chicken, the battalion headquarters also sent a bottle of wine. Each chicken and wine bottle had a piece of paper attached to it. The wine bottle sent by the battalion headquarters read: "Fine wine for heroes, make meritorious service on the city of Xinbaoan." The chicken said: "Heroes eat fat chicken, killing the enemy is like slaughtering a chicken." The machine gun company sent a chicken that read: "Rooster sent to the Spearhead Company, make meritorious service and spread a good name." The First Company sent a chicken that read: "Dedicated to you a chicken, thoroughly eliminate Fu Zuoyi." etc. These mobilization slogans encouraged all the comrades of the "Spearhead Company," who demonstrated unparalleled bravery and decisiveness in the battle to annihilate Fu bandit's Thirty-fifth Army, and successfully completed the assault mission.

　　“突围？那是梦想！”
    上月七日黄昏，张家口被我军重重包围了。死亡已轮到头顶的傅匪们，是不惜一切代价企图打开一道缺口，夺路逃窜。他们拼凑了守城的一半兵力（两个步兵师，一千骑兵）于九日上午以四个团的兵力，向我宁远堡以西清水河以东阵地猛攻。这里是我军某部三营的阵地。阵地前面地势起伏，干涸的水渠岸上，布满了砍伐过后的树杈。三营全体指战员同志心里明白：阵地是绝不能丢的；这是对党对人民负责的战斗；关系着解放全华北迟早问题。他们紧张地怒视着前方，这时，敌人密集的兵力冲上来了，战士们沉着的在敌人进入距离二十米达的时候，战士们齐喊了声“打！”举起了早为匪徒们预备好的点心——手榴弹甩了过去，象无数的黑流星从空中飞过，在敌人面前一个个开了花，与此同时，几挺机枪也“哇——哇”的大叫起来；一阵突然的暴风雨，把敌人卷着连爬带滚的退了回去。
    敌人那能就此甘心？不到五分钟，战栗的匪徒们，又被督战队用枪赶着冲了上来，战士们心里在好笑“这群猪！”一面把手榴弹拉出了弦，紧紧的握在手心。这次，友邻兄弟部队也助了威，掩蔽在树杈里的几挺机枪，哈哈大笑着射向敌人，敌人便扭着、跳着、歪着一个个扑倒在地上，手榴弹轰起的尘土，掩埋了狗们的尸体。
    虽然连叠失败的敌人，却仍没放弃突围逃命的决心，接着，第三次，第四………浪潮似的打来，当然，每一次敌人都是成排成排的倒下去，但是我们英勇的同志们也逐渐减少了，就这样一支小的但是顽强的部队猛烈的抗击了超过自己十倍以上的敌人；人少了拉散开来；子弹没有了用刺刀拼，全体指战员在隔渠对峙的短刃交战里，打退了敌人接五连六的冲锋。
    下午三点钟，敌人组织了最后一次冲锋。象麦地里的乌鸦黑压压的一片涌上来了，敌人以最强烈的火力掩护着，在众寡悬殊下，战士们移动了，敌人趁势爬上来，三营的阵地渐渐的被侵蚀了。“冲啊！同志们！收回阵地！”是谁猛的喊了一声，眼看着受伤三处不下火线的共产党员三连长黄树田，端起带刺刀的枪，站起来，冲了上去，紧接着董志明也冲上去了，冲上去了，一个，一个………三营全体都冲上去了。子弹光了，用刺刀，刺刀弯了，换上敌人手里的一把，躬腰抽下敌人尸体上的手榴弹又猛掷过去。打！冲！终于，三营就这样英勇的驱除了敌人，收复了原阵地。敌人突围的幻想，也随着遗留下的一百七十多具尸体而消灭了。吃着晚饭一个战士说：“突围？有老子一口气在你傅作义就不用想。”
    太阳落山的时候，洋河畔的上空升起了几道白光，这是我军总攻的信号。大炮随着震吼起来。

    “美酒送英豪”
    在新保安围歼傅匪主力三十五军的战斗动员中，解放军某部一营创造“美酒送英豪”的鼓动方式。全营各连队都给担任光荣突击任务的“尖兵连”送鸡一只，营部除送鸡一只外，又送酒一瓶。每只鸡和酒瓶上都贴着纸条，营部送的酒瓶上写着：“美酒送英豪，新保安城上立功劳。”鸡身上写“英雄吃了肥鸡肉，杀敌好比宰鸡同。”机枪连送的鸡上写着：“雄鸡送给尖兵连，杀敌立功美名传。”一连送的鸡上写道：“献给你们一只鸡，彻底消灭傅作义。”等，这些鼓动口号，鼓舞着“尖兵连”全体同志，在围歼傅匪三十五军的战斗中，表现了无比的英勇果敢，胜利的完成了突击任务。　　　　　　　　　　（墨山）
