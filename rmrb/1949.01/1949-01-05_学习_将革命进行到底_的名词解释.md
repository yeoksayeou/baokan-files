"The April 12th Counter-Revolutionary Coup of 1927" – In 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen accepted the proposal of the Chinese Communist Party, convened the First National Congress of the Kuomintang with the participation of Communists, and formulated the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, thus realizing the national united front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and people from all walks of life. As a result, in 1925, the reactionary forces in Guangdong were swept away, and in 1926-1927, the victorious Northern Expedition was launched, defeating the Northern Warlord government and initiating a broad people's liberation struggle unprecedented in Chinese history. However, in the spring and summer of 1927, at a crucial moment when the Northern Expedition was moving forward, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, colluded with domestic feudal forces and foreign imperialism, and openly undermined the national united front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and people from all walks of life, which represented the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, and all its revolutionary policies, implementing a treacherous anti-people "purification" policy and massacre policy, and faithlessly launched a sudden attack on the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. On the evening of April 11th, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized troops in Shanghai as a backing, ordering secret agents and gangsters to attack the Shanghai workers' pickets (the working class's own armed forces at the time), and forcibly confiscated the pickets' weapons under the pretext of infighting among the workers' pickets. On April 12th, workers throughout Shanghai were outraged upon hearing the news, and after holding a mass rally in Zhabei, they set out on a march to petition, only to be subjected to a brutal massacre by the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary army in the Baoshan Road area. For a time, corpses littered the streets, blood flowed like rivers, and countless workers were killed or wounded. Many outstanding Communist Party members also sacrificed themselves in this massacre, resulting in the unprecedented "April 12th" massacre. Thus, the vigorous Chinese revolution was buried. This was the counter-revolutionary coup of April 12th, 1927.

Chongqing Negotiations – These were the negotiations conducted by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Kuomintang in Chongqing from the end of August to October 10, 1945. The representatives in these negotiations were Comrades Zhou Enlai and Wang Ruofei on the CCP side; and Wang Shijie, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Shao Lizi on the Kuomintang side. Chairman Mao personally flew to Chongqing for this purpose on August 28th and returned to Yan'an on October 11th. The negotiations were signed on October 10th, and preliminary agreements were reached on twelve issues, including the principles for peaceful nation-building, political democratization, people's freedom, the legitimacy of parties, the abolition of secret service agencies, the release of political prisoners, the promotion of local autonomy, the nationalization of the army, the local governments in the liberated areas, the handling of traitors and collaborators, and the acceptance of the surrender of Japanese bandits. However, the Kuomintang, determined to sell out the country and wage civil war, not only failed to comply with any of these agreed-upon matters, but also immediately launched an offensive against the liberated areas.

Political Consultative Conference – This was convened in Chongqing from January 10th to January 31st, 1946, under the pressure of the Chinese Communist Party's adherence to the policy of peace and democracy and the nationwide demand for peace. Representatives attending the Political Consultative Conference included the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and non-party figures. At that time, five major proposals were decided upon regarding government reorganization, the National Assembly, the program for peaceful nation-building, the draft constitution, and military issues. However, these resolutions were later completely torn up by the Kuomintang's launch of the civil war.

New Political Consultative Conference – In the slogans issued by the Chinese Communist Party on May 1st Labor Day in 1948, the fifth article proposed: "All democratic parties, people's organizations, and social figures of virtue and prestige should promptly convene a Political Consultative Conference to discuss and realize the convening of a People's Congress and the establishment of a coalition government." On May 5th, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Zhi Gong Party, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the China National Salvation Association sent telegrams to Chairman Mao expressing their support for this slogan.

Commercial Privileges – This is a special right given by the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek to US imperialism in China's commerce. In April 1946, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek promulgated the "New Company Law." This "New Company Law," which sold out China's sovereignty, stipulated special privileges for foreign (actually, his foreign father, US imperialism) companies, that is, it allowed foreign (US imperialist) monopoly capital to invest in various enterprise sectors in China and allowed US imperialist monopoly capital to control Chinese companies. In June of the same year, US imperialism invested 190,000 million yuan. Later, the "China-US Industrial Company," jointly opened by the US reactionary Chennault and Chinese comprador bureaucratic capital, spread throughout Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Guiyang, and other places, further manipulating Chinese private companies. More than 150 US-run commercial companies were opened in Shanghai. With the signing of the Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous new treaty – the so-called "Sino-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" – on November 4th of the previous year, the "status" of US imperialism to run factories and open stores in China became more consolidated.

Airspace Rights – This is the sovereignty over a country's airspace. Originally, the airspace of a country could not be arbitrarily flown by foreign aircraft (except for aviation agreements truly concluded between two countries on an equal footing), but the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek, in order to obtain the aid of US imperialism to carry out the anti-people civil war, did not hesitate to sell out China's airspace sovereignty to his foreign father, US imperialism. For example, on August 30, 1946, Chiang Kai-shek signed a contract with Chennault of the United States, allowing Chennault to organize the Air Transport Corps to fly throughout China. Then, on November 30th, Chiang Kai-shek and US imperialism established the "Draft Sino-US Aviation Agreement," allowing US imperialist aircraft to load and unload goods at major Chinese cities such as Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. On December 20th, the Chiang bandits signed the "Sino-US Aviation Agreement" with US imperialism, comprehensively selling out China's airspace rights, allowing US imperialist aircraft to load and unload goods and passengers at will at any location, and giving his foreign father the right to land aircraft for military needs.

　　学习“将革命进行到底”的名词解释
    为帮助大家学习新华社社论“将革命进行到底”这一文件，我们选择了几个有关系的名辞加以解释；并希望读者把自己在学习中遇到的问题提出来，大家一齐来研究和讨论，共同推动对这一重要文件的学习。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    “一九二七年四月十二日反革命政变”——一九二四年，孙中山先生接受了中国共产党的建议，召集了有共产党人参加的第一次国民党全国代表大会，订出了联俄、联共、扶助工农的三大政策，实现了国共两党及各界人民的民族统一战线，因而在一九二五年，扫荡了广东的反动势力，在一九二六至一九二七年，举行了胜利的北伐战争，打败了北洋军阀政府，发动了广大的在中国历史上是空前的人民解放斗争。但是到了一九二七年春夏之交，正在北伐战争向前发展的紧要关头，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派，就勾结了国内的封建势力和国外的帝国主义，公然破坏了这个代表中国人民解放事业的国共两党及各界人民的民族统一战线及其一切革命政策，实行了叛卖性的反人民的“清党”政策与屠杀政策，而背信弃义地向着中国共产党与中国人民来了一个突然的袭击。蒋介石于四月十一日晚上，在上海调集军队做为后盾，命令特务、流氓向上海的工人纠察队（当时工人阶级自己的武装）袭击，并借口工人纠察队内讧，强行收缴了纠察队的武器。四月十二日，全上海市的工人闻讯大愤，在闸北召开了群众大会后，就出发游行请愿，在宝山路一带即惨遭国民党反革命军队的大屠杀。一时尸体满街，血流如注，死伤工人不计其数，许多优秀的共产党员也在这次屠杀中牺牲。遂造成空前未有的“四、一二”大惨案。至此，生气勃勃的中国大革命就被葬送了。这就是一九二七年四月十二日的反革命政变。
    重庆谈判——是一九四五年八月底，至同年十月十日，中国共产党与中国国民党在重庆进行的谈判。这次谈判的代表，中共方面为周恩来、王若飞两同志；国民党方面为王世杰、张群、张治中、邵力子等人；毛主席为此于八月廿八日亲自飞往重庆，至十月十一日返回延安。谈判于十月十日签字，初步商定了关于和平建国方针、政治民主化、人民自由、党派合法、取销特务机关、释放政治犯、推行地方自治、军队国家化、解放区地方政府、处置奸伪、接受日寇投降等十二个问题。但是决心卖国内战的国民党，不但对这些商定的事项一项都没有遵行，而且随即发动了对解放区的进攻。
    政治协商会议——是一九四六年一月十日至同月卅一日，国民党在中国共产党坚持和平民主方针与全国人民要求和平的压力之下，在重庆召开的。出席政治协商会议的代表，计有国民党、共产党、民主同盟、青年党、无党无派人士等。当时决定了关于政府改组、国民大会、和平建国纲领、宪法草案、军事问题等五大议案。但后来这些决议都被国民党的发动内战所彻底撕毁。
    新政治协商会议——一九四八年五一劳动节，中国共产党颁发的口号中，第五条曾提出：“各民主党派、各人民团体、各社会贤达迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立联合政府。”五月五日，中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主促进会、致公党、中国农工民主党、中国人民救国会曾致电毛主席表示拥护这一口号。
    商业特权——是反动的蒋介石给美帝国主义在中国商业上的一种特殊权利。一九四六年四月，卖国贼蒋介石颁布“新公司法”，这个出卖中国主权的“新公司法”规定给外国（实际上是他洋爸爸美帝国主义）公司特权，就是允许外国（美帝国主义）的独占资本在中国各种企业部门投资，并让美帝国主义独占资本掌握中国公司。同年六月美帝国主义就投资有十九万万元，后来美反动派陈纳德与中国买办官僚资本合开的“中美实业公司”遍及上海、南京、芜湖、九江、贵阳等地，更操纵了中国民营的公司，美帝在上海开办的商号公司就有一百五十多家，到前年十一月四日一蒋介石卖国新约——即所谓“中美通商航海条约”的签订，使美帝在中国办工厂、开商店的“地位”更巩固起来了。
    领空权——是一国上空的主权。本来一国上空是不能随便任外国飞机航行的（除两国真正以平等相待所订的航空协定外），但反动的蒋介石为求得美帝国主义的援助以进行反人民内战，竟不惜中国领空主权，而出卖给他的洋爸爸美帝国主义。如一九四六年八月三十日蒋介石与美国的陈纳德签订准许陈纳德组织行总空运大队在中国各地飞行的合同，接着十一月三十日蒋介石又与美帝国主义成立“中美航空协定草案”，把中国的大城市如天津、上海、广州机场允许美帝飞机装卸货物之用，到十二月二十日蒋匪与美帝签订了“中美航空协定”，全面出卖了中国的领空权，让美帝国主义的飞机可以随意在任何地点装卸货物和乘客，并给了他的洋爸爸用作军事需要的飞机降落权。
