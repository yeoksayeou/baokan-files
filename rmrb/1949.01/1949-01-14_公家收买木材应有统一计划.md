Criticism and Suggestions

　　Public Acquisition of Timber Should Have a Unified Plan
　　Editor:
　　I have a suggestion regarding the current public acquisition of timber. I am not sure if it is correct, and I would appreciate a reply.
　　Due to the rapid progress of the overall situation, many cities, transportation arteries, mining areas, etc., will be permanently managed by the people. Therefore, everything damaged in the war needs to be repaired quickly by our people. However, if this work is not managed in a unified manner, it will lead to a focus on the immediate, neglecting the future. In recent years, the higher authorities have been calling on the masses to plant trees and create forests every year, but in reality, more trees are being cut down than planted. From Xihu Village, Third District of Lingshou, downstream along the Shun River to Nanwu River, a length of thirteen li, it is estimated that no less than tens of thousands of trees were cut down last winter alone. But in terms of cultivation, I see mostly tree pits, with few newly planted trees. Now, for the sake of construction, the higher authorities are constantly issuing notices to purchase various types of timber. Because the masses want firewood, they will cut down a tree as long as it yields a sleeper. They also continue to cut and burn trees under the pretext that they have problems. The acquisition of sleepers has already passed, and now the public is acquiring pit props (used in coal mines). However, materials that were previously not good enough for sleepers but good enough for pit props have already been burned as firewood. The masses, in order to spend money now, are taking the opportunity to cut down large quantities of trees. Now the public wants seven-fen boards and boards of other sizes. If there is no unified management and planning from the higher authorities, it will inevitably lead to acquiring sleepers without regard to pit props, getting boards without regard to sleepers, using large materials for small purposes, and wasting a lot. Some people are reflecting: "If this continues, it will be difficult to build a house in the future." Others say: "Why doesn't the public manage this in a unified way? Are we all just going to do our own thing? If we continue like this, it will only be enough for one material, and future construction will be a problem!" Therefore, I suggest that the responsible authorities have unified leadership and planning for this work, and set up special personnel in the lower-level organs to guide the work of mobilizing materials in the villages. We should focus more on materials and less on, or not at all on, using them for firewood. We should plan for long-term construction in the future.
　　Also, please answer: Is it reasonable for the public to force people to sell trees if they are unwilling?

### 公家收买木材应有统一计划

　　公家收买木材应有统一计划编辑同志：
    关于现在公家收买木材一事，我有一点意见，不知是否正确，请函复。
    由于整个形势飞速进展，不少城市、交通要道、矿区等，将永远由人民管理，所以在战争中被损坏的一切，就需要我人民大众赶快修复。可是这工作如果没有统一的掌握，便会形成只顾眼下，不顾将来。就近几年说，上级每年都在号召群众植树造林，但实际却是砍伐多而培植少。从灵寿三区西湖社顺河而下，至南伍河，十三里之长，光去年冬天说，大约砍掉不下几万棵树。但在培植上，我看到多是树坑，少有新栽树。现在为了建设，上级在不断的下通知收买各种木材，群众因想烧柴，只要出一根道木材料，便砍倒一棵树。另外还借口树有毛病，继续砍烧。现在收买道木已过去，公家又收买顶木了（煤矿上用的）。可是以前不够道木材料，却够顶木用的材料，都已当柴烧了。群众为了当下花钱，便又乘机会大量的砍下去。公家现在又要七分板和其他分寸的板子，如果没有上级统一掌握和计划，一定会造成打道木不管出顶木，拉板子不管用道木，大材小用，浪费很多。有的人就反映：象这样下去，将来盖间房子也难了。还有的说：“公家为什么不统一掌握起来呢？都是各管各作下去吗？如果这样作下去，只管够一个材料就行，今后建设可是个事！”所以我建议上级负责机关对这一工作应有统一领导和计划，并在下层机关设专人指导村中动员器材的工作。应该多从材料上打算，少从或根本不从烧柴上去打算。为今后长期建设打算。
    并请回答：有人不愿卖树，公家硬号，是否合理？
