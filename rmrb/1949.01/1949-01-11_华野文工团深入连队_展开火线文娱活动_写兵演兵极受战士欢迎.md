Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 8th. Cultural troupes from various units of the East China Field Army (Hua Ye) have been going deep into the companies during the Huaihai Campaign to carry out frontline cultural and entertainment activities, which have been warmly loved by the soldiers. They absorbed materials from the actual lives of the troops at that time and place, and used forms such as fast-clapper rhymes, ditties, living newspapers, gun-barrel poems, lantern slides, and pictures, combined with short plays and singing, to carry out propaganda and mobilization, achieving great results. For example, the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the East China Field Army collected and learned about the heroic deeds of a certain PLA unit seizing the Grand Canal railway bridge in the pursuit battle east of Xuzhou, and showed it in the form of picture lantern slides and short plays, which was extremely popular among the soldiers. When the 3rd Battalion of a certain regiment annihilated the Huang Botao Corps, a large number of model soldiers emerged. The cultural troupe compiled the model deeds of these soldiers into short plays. After watching it, Jia Bingwen, a soldier from the 2nd Platoon of the 9th Company, said: "Look, those model soldiers are all in the play. If we work hard, we can also create a model." A certain cultural and entertainment work team that followed a certain regiment compiled the speech of Political Commissar He of the regiment before departure, calling on everyone to fight fiercely and pursue fiercely, into a fast-clapper rhyme.

Comrades from a certain cultural troupe often lived with the soldiers in the trenches. Once, the Zhang Keming group of the troupe was walking and singing along the trenches when a shell landed near them, but their fast-clapper rhyme did not stop. Comrades Sun Yongjing and Chen Jiu'an of the troupe once accompanied the troops on an attack. When the troops ran to a place 200 meters away from the enemy and temporarily stopped, Sun Yongjing lay on the trench and sang to the soldiers of the first platoon who were preparing to continue advancing: "Comrades of the first platoon, get ready, bullets loaded, guns and knives ready, the enemy is in chaos, we bravely rush up, quickly make contributions for the people. ......" This greatly boosted the soldiers' combat morale. After the first platoon returned from the attack, the platoon leader said to Sun Yongjing: "At that time, your singing greatly boosted everyone's morale. We chased very fast and suffered very few casualties." Because the comrades of the cultural troupe went deep into the companies to work, the newly liberated soldiers were greatly moved. A newly liberated soldier surnamed Sun said: "The Kuomintang army has 'political work teams', but they are far behind, performing plays for the officials to watch. The People's Liberation Army's cultural troupes all come to the front line, singing about the affairs of our soldiers."

　　华野文工团深入连队
  　展开火线文娱活动
  　写兵演兵极受战士欢迎
    【新华社淮海前线八日电】华东野战军各部文工团，在淮海战役中，纷纷深入连队，开展火线文化娱乐活动，受到战士们的热烈爱戴。他们吸取了当时当地部队的实际生活的材料，用快板、小调、活报、枪杆诗、幻灯、画片等形式，配合短剧、歌咏，进行宣传鼓动，获得很大效果。如华东野战军政治部文工团搜集了解放军某部在徐州以东追击战中抢占运河铁桥的英勇事迹，用画片幻灯放映与编成短剧出演，极受战士欢迎。某团三营在歼灭黄伯韬兵团时，涌现大批模范战士，该文工团即将这些战士的模范事迹编成短剧出演。九连二班战士贾冰文看后说：“你看那些模范战士都上了剧，咱们好好努力也能创造模范。”跟随某团工作的某文娱工作队在追击徐州逃敌中，将该团何政委于出发前号召大家猛打猛追的讲话，编成了快板唱起来。
    某连行军在中途休息时，该连指导员告诉文工队的李秀林同志，该连缴获归公做得不错，可是还有某些同志思想不通，要他编个歌子教育一下，李秀林马上连编连唱起来了，某文工队同志常常到战壕里，和战士们生活在一起。某次该队张克明小组正顺着战壕边走边唱，忽然一颗炮弹落在他们附近，但他们的快板依然没有中断。该队孙永经和陈久安两同志曾随同部队出击，当部队跑到距敌人二百米达处暂时停止时，孙永经就伏在壕沟上对准备继续前进的一排战士唱道：“一排同志准备好，子弹上膛枪上刀，敌人已经乱纷纷，我们勇敢冲上去，快为人民立功劳。………”大大鼓舞了战士们的作战情绪，该排出击回来后，排长对孙永经说：“当时经你这一唱，大家的情绪很高，追的很快，伤亡也很少”。由于文工团同志深入连队工作，使新解放战士大受感动。一个姓孙的新解放战士说：“国民党军队里有‘政工队’，他们是远在后方演戏给当官看的，解放军的文工团都到火线上来，尽唱咱们兵的事。”
