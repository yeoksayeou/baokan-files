　　What is "White Pregnancy"?

　　To the Editor:
    We have also read a lesson on "Maternal and Infant Hygiene Common Sense": Where do children come from? It says that if a man and woman have relations within six or seven days after a woman's menstruation, it is easiest to conceive. However, some women do not have menstruation for a long time, but they still become pregnant. We don't know the reason for this. The villagers say this is "white pregnancy," and that children from white pregnancies do not survive. Is this statement reasonable? Please give a detailed answer.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Yang Mo, Wang Zhixing, Jianping County)

    The answers to the questions raised by Yang Mo and Wang Zhixing of Jianping County are as follows:

    Before answering this question, the following points must be clarified: (1) Menstruation occurs when an unfertilized egg is discharged from the body. Its function is also to cleanse the uterine lining to prepare for the next implantation of a fertilized egg. Therefore, menstruation can also be regarded as the miscarriage of an egg; (2) The ovulation period is twelve to sixteen days before the next menstruation; (3) The fertile period is twelve to nineteen days before the next menstruation (the fertilization ability of an egg can last for several to a dozen hours, and sperm can survive for three days in the sexual organs, so it is possible to conceive if sexual intercourse occurs three days before ovulation).

    Based on the above circumstances, regardless of whether there has been menstruation before, as long as there is ovulation function now, there is a possibility of conception. If conception occurs, menstruation will not occur. Superficially, it appears that pregnancy occurs without menstruation, which is what is called "white pregnancy."

    As for the reasons for the absence of menstruation, there are two possibilities: (1) Physiological amenorrhea. One is that menarche has not yet occurred (in this situation, it is extremely rare for pregnancy to occur without menstruation, because menarche averages at the age of fourteen or fifteen, which is before marriage). The other is that there is no menstruation during childbirth and lactation. If sexual intercourse occurs two or three days before ovulation or during ovulation, and conception occurs, then menstruation will not occur due to pregnancy. Physiologically speaking, there is no menstruation between one child and the next, which is also what is called "white pregnancy."

    (2) Absence of menstruation due to illness (there are many diseases that cause amenorrhea). In this case, it is not simply the absence of menstruation, but also the absence of ovulation function, so there is no possibility of conception. However, if her illness is treated or heals naturally, physiological ovulation will occur. Similarly, when pregnancy occurs after this ovulation, it appears that pregnancy occurs without menstruation, which is also called "white pregnancy."

    (3) When the body is ill, such as with syphilis, gonorrhea, heart disease, anemia, tuberculosis, or retroverted uterus, pregnancy and even delivery can occur safely, but miscarriage or premature birth is likely to occur. Another situation is when there has been no menstruation before, and then the abdomen gradually swells, often mistaken for pregnancy, but it is actually a tumor. What the villagers call "white pregnancy" may refer to this type.

    Children conceived in the first two situations can survive. Children born in the latter situation have a lower chance of survival.

### “白胎”是怎么回事？

　　“白胎”是怎么回事？编辑同志：
    我们也曾看过“妇婴卫生常识”上的一课：孩子从何处来？上边说：在妇女月经后六七天内，男女发生关系，最易怀胎，但有些妇女在很长时间内没有月经，可是就怀上胎了，不知是什么原因？据老乡说，这是“白胎”，又说白胎孩子不成人，这种说法是否有道理？请作一详细答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（建屏县杨墨、王之行）
    建屏县杨墨，王之行所询问题，答复如下：
    当解答此问题之前，须弄清以下几点：（一）月经是未受精的卵子排出体外时发生的，它的功用，还能清洗子宫粘膜，以为下次受精卵着床的准备，所以也可把月经看作卵子的流产；（二）排卵期间，在下次月经前十二天至十六天；（三）受胎期是在下次月经的前十二天到十九天（卵子受精能力可持续数小时到十数小时，精子于性器官内可活三天，所以说排卵前三天性交亦有受胎的可能）。
    根据以上情形，不管以前有无月经，只要现在有排卵机能，就有受胎的可能，如果能受胎的话就不发生月经了，表面上就是没有月经而怀胎了，这就是所谓的“白胎”。
    至于无月经原因有两种：（一）生理上的无月经，一个是尚未到初潮（在这种情形无月经怀胎者极少，因为初潮平均在十四五岁，尚在结婚之前），再一个是因生小孩及哺郛期间是没有月经的，如果恰巧在刚要排卵前二三天或正在排卵期，发生性的关系而受胎时，则又因怀胎而无月经了，由生理上说一个小孩到怀下一个小孩之间没有月经，这也是所说的“白胎”。
    （二）因为疾病没有月经（无月经的疾病很多），这种情形不单纯是没有月经，而且没有排卵机能，所以没有受胎的可能。不过她的病或因治疗或自然治愈，就要进行生理上的排卵，同样的在这一次排卵之后而怀孕时，表面上没有月经就怀孕了这也是所谓“白胎”。
    （三）身体有病时，如梅毒，淋病，心脏病，贫血，结核，子宫后屈等病患，也可以怀孕，也可安然分娩，但很容易发生流产或早产；再有一种是以前没有月经，以后腹部渐次膨隆，常误认为怀孕，实际是肿瘤，老乡们所谓的“白胎”，很可能是指这一种。
    前两种情况下受孕生的孩子，可以养活；后一种情况下生的孩子，养活的可能性较少。
