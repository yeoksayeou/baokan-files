[Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] The Yan Xishan bandit troops in Taiyuan are increasingly in a state of exhaustion of food supplies and cut off from aid. Soldiers are not getting enough to eat, their families are constantly starving to death, morale is low, and desertions are increasing. According to Liu Derong, a cook from a heavy machine gun company of the Yan bandit's headquarters who escaped from Taiyuan at the beginning of this month: now the soldiers of this unit are only issued 14 taels of mixed grains per day, and they generally do not have enough to eat. Those with families are even more unable to live. Because prices in the city rise several times a day, people are not interested in counterfeit legal tender and counterfeit gold yuan coupons. Transactions are calculated in silver dollars. At the end of November last year, the ratio of counterfeit gold yuan coupons to silver dollars was two to one, on the fifth of last month it was thirty-nine to one, on the ninth it was two hundred and forty to one, and on the evening of the same day it was as high as three hundred to one. Now one silver dollar can only buy three and a half catties of coarse rice. Since the Yan bandits implemented the substitution of currency for in-kind rations around November last year, the lives of workers and citizens have become even more miserable. In November last year, workers were only issued 30 to 40 counterfeit gold yuan coupons per month, which was not enough to maintain their own lives, let alone feed their wives and children. According to Li Dengying, a worker from the Tongpu Railway who escaped, of the more than 2,800 employees in the railway factory and its affiliated agencies, a quarter have fled to the liberated areas in the past month alone due to hunger.

It is said that Jinxin Qianzhuang is the best in the city, but after the Yan bandits extorted heavily, eight shop assistants were forced to form a group, forcing the manager to flee, leaving only the cook. Once, because he did not go on a business trip, he was fined eight packs of cigarettes. Now he is forced to offer eight silver dollars every day as "comfort money." As for ordinary industrial, commercial citizens and students, they are forced to form various wartime labor organizations. Those aged 17 to 35 are being formed into combat troops, those aged 36 to 47 are formed into standing teams, and those aged 48 to old age are formed into various labor teams. Women and children are also forced to build bunkers for the Yan bandits without exception. The Yan bandits' wounded soldiers have filled schools, warehouses, and ancient temples. They can only get a piece of black bread for each meal, have no medicine, and cannot drink boiled water. Those who are seriously injured and cannot continue to sell their lives for them are abandoned by the Yan bandits. Therefore, wounded soldiers with missing arms and legs are running around in the city. In some places, you can see corpses thrown in the trenches in a disorderly manner. At present, the people of the whole city earnestly hope to be liberated soon. When they hear the fierce artillery battles outside the city, they are very happy, knowing that the People's Liberation Army is about to enter the city.

　　太原阎匪粮尽援绝市民盼望快获解放
    【晋中电】太原阎匪日益处于粮尽援绝的境地，官兵因吃不饱、及其家属不时饿死，作战情绪低落，逃亡者增多。据本月初，从太原逃出之阎匪总司令部重机枪团一连伙夫刘德荣称：现该部士兵每日仅发杂粮十四两，普遍吃不饱肚子，带家眷的更是无法生活。由于市上物价一日数涨，人们对伪法币与伪金圆券均不感兴趣，交易皆以白洋计算，在去年十一月底，伪金圆券与白洋的比值曾为二比一，上月五日则为三九比一，九日为二四零比一，同日晚竟为三百比一。现洋一元仅能买到粗谷米三斤半。阎匪自去年十一月左右，实行了以货币代替实物配给后，工人及市民生活则更为悲惨，去年十一月工人每人每月仅发伪金圆券三十元到四十元，自身生活尚不足维持，老婆孩子更无法糊口，据逃出之同蒲铁路工人李登瀛说：该铁路工厂及所属机关共有职工二千八百余人，因饥饿仅最近一个月内，逃来解放区者即占四分之一。
    晋信钱庄据称为全城之冠，但于阎匪大肆勒索后，八个店员又被迫编了组，逼得经理逃走，只剩下做饭的大司傅一人，一次因未出差，被罚八条纸烟，现每日并强令献白洋八块，作为“慰劳金”。至于一般的工商市民及学生等，均被迫编为各种战时劳役组织，十七岁至三十五岁者，正被编为作战部队，三十六岁至四十七岁者编为常备队，四十八岁至老年者编为各种劳役队，妇女儿童亦毫不例外的被迫为阎匪修碉堡。阎匪的伤兵，已塞满了学校、仓库和古庙，他们每饭仅能得到黑面饼一块，既无医药又喝不到开水。身受重伤不能为其继续卖命者，即被阎匪抛弃，因而，缺臂断腿的伤兵，在市内到处乱撞，有的地方可以看到横三竖四的死尸被抛在战壕里。目前全市人民殷切盼望很快的得到解放，当他们听到城外的激烈炮战之后，就非常愉快，知道解放军快进城啦。
