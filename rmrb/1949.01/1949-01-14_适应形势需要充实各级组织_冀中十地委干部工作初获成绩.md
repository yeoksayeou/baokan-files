　　To Adapt to the Situation Requires Strengthening Organizations at All Levels
　　Initial Successes in Cadre Work by the Tenth District Committee of Central Hebei
　　[Central Hebei Electric] The Tenth District Committee has recently promoted a large number of cadres to strengthen organizations at all levels (mainly districts) and to involve them in supporting the front and working in new areas. At the beginning of the winter work last year, the District Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the District Party Committee, decided to complete the promotion of 1,000 cadres from December of last year to the end of January of this year in order to meet the upcoming new situation. Thanks to the efforts of various counties, achievements have been made. According to inaccurate statistics for December alone (the actual number is likely to be higher), the entire district has reached 665 people. Rongcheng, Xiongxian, Baxian, and Xinxiong (parts of Xin'an and Xiongxian) counties, in addition to supplementing their own county-level cadres, have also sent 160 district-level cadres with longer work histories to work in new areas (some are still temporarily supporting the front). The newly promoted cadres from the villages have generally established the idea of serving the people, are able to accept assignments, and are mostly responsive to the District Committee's call: "Work day and night, bury yourselves in hard work, and work actively." Before the departure of the First Work Group, teams and groups launched challenges, proposing: to obey assignments, not to discount work, not to go home while performing tasks, to ensure intense work, and to study hard. Newly promoted cadres working locally are generally also content with their work. For example, five newly promoted cadres in Dongguan, Baxian, said: "The old cadres opened up the world for us, and now they are going to work in new areas. How can we not work hard at our doorstep?" Some village cadres voluntarily requested to leave production and take on more work. In promoting cadres, the villages generally adopted the policy of prioritizing ideological work and improving awareness, combined with resolving the personal difficulties of cadres and conducting discipline education. In terms of methods, the following were generally used: 1. Counties specifically help districts, adopting collective education to mobilize promotions (generally through training classes and village cadre meetings, with activists leading the general population). 2. Collective research of candidates followed by individual mobilization, combined with addressing the specific problems of the cadres themselves (such as family issues). Also, organizing work teams to work while training and promoting. In addition, counties such as Gu'an, Zhuozhou, Liangwan, Liangxiang, and Wanping paid attention to cultivating and educating activists in supporting the front work, preparing them for promotion. The above methods have been relatively successful, but some deviations have also occurred in the implementation in some places. For example, Rongcheng Fifth District neglected education and emphasized obedience to transfers, and Jinwu Eighth District used pleading methods to promote cadres, resulting in little achievement. At present, the Tenth District has been completely liberated, and vast new areas need cadres to build them. The various levels of cadres in the consolidated areas also need to be strengthened and improved. The District Committee has decided to continue to vigorously cultivate and promote new cadres in conjunction with the task of supporting the front.

　　适应形势需要充实各级组织
  　冀中十地委干部工作初获成绩
    【冀中电】十地委近来提拔了大批干部，充实各级组织（主要是区）及投入支前和新区工作。去年冬季工作开始时，地委根据区党委的指示，决定于去年十二月起至今年一月底完成提拔干部一千名，以迎接即将到来的新形势。经各县努力，已获得了成绩，仅十二月份不精确的统计（占计还会多），全区已达六百六十五人。容城、雄县、霸县、新雄（新镇、雄县各一部）等四县，除补充本县各级干部外，并已输出一百六十个工作历史较长的区级干部到新区工作（一部分暂时还在支前）。新由村里提拔出来的干部，一般的都树立了为人民服务的思想，能服从分配，多能响应着地委的号召：“日以继夜，埋头苦干，积极工作。”第一工作团出发前，队与队、组与组发起挑战，提出：服从分配，工作不打折扣，执行任务时不回家，保证紧张工作，努力学习。新提出来在本地工作的干部，一般的也安心工作。如霸县东关新提的五个干部说：“老干部给咱们打开天下，他们又要到新区工作，让咱们在家门上咱还不好好干？”有的村干部自动要求脱离生产，担负更多的工作。各村在提拔干部上，是采取打通思想、提高觉悟为主，并结合解决干部亲身困难与进行纪律教育的方针。在方法上，一般采用了以下几种：一、县具体帮助区，采用集体教育动员提拔。（一般是开训练班和村干部大会，积极分子带动一般。）二、是集体研究对象分头动员，结合处理干部本身的具体问题（如家庭问题等）。再是组织工作队，一面工作，一面培养提拔。另外，如固安、涿县、良宛、良乡、宛平等县，在支前工作的积极分子中，注意培养教育，准备提拔。以上方法是比较成功的，但有些地方执行也发生一些偏差，如容城五区忽视教育强调服从调动，津武八区用央求的办法提拔干部，结果成绩很小。目前十分区已全部解放，广大新区须要干部去建设，巩固区的各级干部也须要充实健全，地委已决定结合支前任务，继续大力培养提拔新干部。
