　　Inspection and Summary of the End of Land Reform and Party Rectification in Ci County
  　(I) End of Land Reform
    The land reform has been completed in most villages of the county. According to statistics from 358 villages, 301 villages are currently preparing and issuing land ownership certificates. These villages are resolving individual remaining issues and promoting production work during the issuance of land ownership certificates. There are 40 villages where remaining issues are significant and land ownership certificates cannot be issued, and 17 villages where the end of land reform has not been carried out at all. The task of these 57 villages is still to end land reform. According to preliminary inspection, the following remaining issues exist:
    (1) In some backward villages, the land reform in the past was not thorough, and the mobilization of the masses was poor. The surplus property of landlords and rich peasants in these villages has not been thoroughly liquidated, or the property of some landlords and rich peasants is higher than that of middle peasants. In some places, the masses are afraid of changes and dare not move their houses. In some places, a class-blind equal distribution is implemented, negating the legitimacy of the fruits of the movement and negating the achievements of past struggles, resulting in the counterattack of landlords and rich peasants… Therefore, considerable feudal remnants are retained. Many such villages are in the Ninth District. In these villages, the summary education of land reform for the masses is insufficient, and no attention has been paid to it in the minds of cadres and the masses. It is necessary to continue to liquidate feudal remnants.
    (2) Unfair distribution of fruits and failure to clean up the remaining fruits of the past. The failure to resolve the stealing, dropping, and excessive occupation of fruits by cadres and party members in the past is a major problem. Because of the lack of ideological mobilization inside and outside the Party, some people's fruits have not been returned, or the remaining fruits could not be clarified for a while due to the chaos in the movement, and things were handled sloppily. These all need to be resolved.
    (3) Individual left-leaning errors have not been corrected, such as not correcting the class status, not returning things after changing the class status, or refusing to supplement industry and commerce under the pretext of difficulties.
    Reasons: First, in our leadership, we simply ended the land reform, lacking in-depth inspection and timely correction. The party rectification work in most villages has not been done well. The experience of party rectification in the Fifth District proves that because the branch has not been rectified, there are many remaining land reform problems.
    Second, the leadership's work on ending land reform is somewhat generalized. The leadership handled some villages in the whole county. Activists from outside fought the landlords, but the masses in the village were not mobilized, and even dissatisfied with us. Some village party members are impure and are outwardly obedient to us but oppress the masses. These villages have unprincipled unity in correcting deviations. It is understood that there are about 80 backward villages in the county. If this work is not done well, all kinds of work will not be done well. Organizational adjustments should be implemented in these villages, and saboteurs should be cracked down on at the same time.
    (II) Party Rectification Inspection
    It is understood that out of 251 branches in the county, according to statistics, 67 have no major problems, 35 villages have initially resolved the relationship between the Party and the masses, 74 have implemented party rectification, and 75 have raised problems that have not been resolved. About two-fifths have undergone preliminary rectification. The vast majority of village branches, whether rectified or not, have led the end of land reform. In general, the party rectification steps have not been followed, and only general self-criticism has been carried out inside and outside the party, which is related to our subjective lack of time and strength.
    Why has it not been rectified well, and why have some made mistakes again after rectification?
    (1) The leadership has not thoroughly implemented the initial rectification in its thinking, and has not carried out the initial rectification seriously.
    (2) The mobilization of party members and the masses in the rectification is insufficient, so the ideological struggle is not thorough, criticism and self-criticism have not been fully launched, right and wrong have not been distinguished, and some have a simple "support" point of view. The state of no organization and no discipline has not been eliminated, and the purpose of party rectification is not clear.
    (3) There is a lack of mass supervision, no mass help in party rectification, and right and wrong have not been clarified.
    After this study, the following work guidelines are determined according to the following types of branches:
    (1) There are no major problems within the branch, or it has undergone preliminary rectification, and there are not many remaining land reform problems. In the future, the main task of the branch is to lead the masses to issue land ownership certificates and carry out production work. These branches are required to conduct a summary inspection of the end of land reform inside and outside the party. Each party member should also summarize it. Intra-party forward-looking education should be carried out, and party members should be called upon to strive to increase production next year, and intra-party life should be initially established.
    (2) For branches with serious sectarian contradictions and disunity that are not easy to resolve for a while, it is required to solve a part and create experience. Solving this problem is a long-term task. Now, the branch should solve it first, and then solve it outside the party. Some branches are engaged in sectarianism themselves, such as fighting for power and profit, and mutual suspicion. This can be resolved through branch rectification. The solution to sectarianism should be based on the party's position and should not listen to only one side. If impurity is found, organizational adjustments can be implemented.
    (3) In backward villages where education is poor and party members are not conscious, and party members view the emancipation as a matter of fate, class education should be carried out to improve the consciousness of party members. Cultivate new activists and develop new party members.
    (4) In the democratic party rectification experimental villages, some have deviations during the rectification, and the party has not been basically rectified. The state of no organization, no discipline, and no government is serious. The new ones do not do anything, and the old ones lie down (about 15 villages). In these villages, party members should be allowed to express their opinions as much as possible to clarify right and wrong. The leadership should make a review, but the party rectification cannot be denied. Those who make trouble unreasonably among party members and the masses and refuse to change after repeated education should be given necessary disciplinary sanctions.
    (5) For individual impure or politically impure elements (estimated to be 15 or 16 branches), the branch should carry out organizational transformation.
    The future direction is to enter the issuance of land ownership certificates and party rectification through summary inspection.

### 磁县结束土改与整党的检查总结

　　磁县结束土改与整党的检查总结
  　（一）结束土改
    全县大部分村结束土改已完成，据三百五十八个村统计，内有三百零一个村目前准备和正在发土地证，这些村是在发土地证中解决个别遗留问题，推动生产工作。遗留问题很大不能发土地证的有四十个村，根本未进行结束的十七个村，这五十七村的任务，仍是结束土改。根据初步检查有以下的遗留问题：
    （一）一部落后村过去土改不彻底，发动群众较差，这些村内地富多余的财产，尚未清算彻底，或者有的地富财产比中农高，有的地方群众怕变天不敢搬房子，有的地方实行不分阶级的大平均分配，否定了运动中所得果实的合法性，否定了过去斗争的成绩，发生地富的反攻现象……因此，保留了相当的封建残余，九区好多这样村。在这些村，对群众的土改总结教育很不够，也没在干部群众思想上引起注意，继续清算封建残余。
    （二）果实分配不公和过去的遗留果实未进行清理，过去偷、掉、和干部党员多占果实也未解决，这是个大问题。因在党内外缺乏思想发动，一部分人的果实没退，或者因运动中很混乱，遗留果实一时弄不清，马虎了事，这些都需要解决。
    （三）个别地方左的错误未纠正，如不订正成份，改订了成份不退东西，或借口困难不退补工商业等。
    原因：一、我们在领导上单纯结束土改，缺乏深入检查及时纠正，大部村的整党工作没搞好。五区整党经验证明：因支部未整顿好，土改问题遗留多。
    二、领导上对结束土改工作有些一般化，对全县有一部村庄是领导上包办的，外来的积极分子斗了地主，本村群众未发动，甚至对我们不满，有些村党内成份不纯，对我们是阳奉阴违，对群众则压迫，这些村对纠偏是无原则的团结，据了解，全县这样落后村在八十个左右，这个工作作不好，各种工作都搞不好。这些村应实行组织调整，同时打击破坏分子。
    （二）整党检查
    据了解全县二百五十一个支部，统计没大问题的六十七个，党和群众关系得到初步解决的三十五个村，实行党内整顿的七十四个，提出问题没解决的七十五个，经过初步整顿的约五分之二。绝大部分村支部不论整顿与否，都领导了结束土改。一般的还没有按整党的步骤进行，只是实行了党内外的一般检讨，这和我们主观上没有时间没有力量有关系。
    为什么没整好，有些整顿后又犯了错误？
    （一）领导思想上没把初步整顿贯彻解决，没有把初步整顿认真进行。
    （二）整顿中对党员和群众发动不够，所以思想斗争不彻底，批评与自我批评未全面展开，是非没分清，有些单纯“扶”的观点，无组织无纪律状态未肃清，整党的目的性不明确。
    （三）缺乏群众监督，没有群众帮助整党，没弄清是非。
    经这次研究，根据以下几种支部类型，确定工作方针：
    （一）支部内没有什么大问题，或已经过初步整顿，土改遗留问题不多，今后主要是支部领导群众发土地证进行生产工作，要求这些支部在党内外进行结束土改的总结检查，每个党员也总结一下，在党内要进行前途教育，号召党员明年要努力增产，党内生活要初步建立。
    （二）宗派矛盾不团结现象严重，不容易一时解决的支部，要求解决一部分创造经验，这个问题要解决是长期的，现在是先由支部解决，然后再到党外解决。有些是支部自己闹宗派，如争权夺利，互相猜疑等，这要经过支部整顿即可解决。解决宗派应站在党的立场上，不要偏听偏信。如发现不纯时，可实行组织调整。
    （三）落后村教育差，党员不觉悟，党员对翻身的看法是命运观点，应进行阶级的教育，提高党员的觉悟程度。培养新的积极分子，发展新党员。
    （四）民主整党实验村，有些因整时有偏向，党基本没整好，无组织无纪律无政府状态严重，新的不干，老的躺倒了（约有十五个村）。这些村应让党员尽情发表意见，弄清是非，领导上作检讨，但不能否定整党，对党员和群众中无理取闹的人再三教育不改的，应给予必要的纪律处分。
    （五）个别成份不纯或政治不纯的分子（估计有十五六个支部），支部应进行组织改造。
    今后方向通过总结检查进入发土地证和整党。
