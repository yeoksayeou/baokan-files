Regarding the Oppression of Workers by Private Tobacco Shops in Xing City
The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions Lodges a Protest
Requesting the Local Government to Collaborate with the Trade Union to Promptly Handle the Matter to Benefit Production

[From Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions has recently lodged a protest against private tobacco shops in Xingtai City, such as Jiuxingwu, Shanxingcheng, and Jicheng, for illegally depriving workers of their rights and interests. The original text is as follows:

This Committee has recently received a report from Taihang, stating that private tobacco shops in Xing City, such as Jiuxingwu, Shanxingcheng, and Jicheng, unilaterally formulated shop rules that solely emphasize the interests of the employers without consulting with the workers. They use dismissal, starvation, and unemployment as means to threaten workers, forcing them to succumb to the unreasonable constraints of the employers. Furthermore, they insult the workers' dignity through so-called "leaving for inspection" (which is essentially a search); they restrict workers' "outing for fun," blocking their opportunities to participate in political life, placing workers in a state of slavery to satisfy their greedy desire for high exploitation. Such behavior is not only a serious infringement of workers' interests but also violates the democratic government's policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production. The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions is extremely indignant about this and, in addition to expressing condolences to the workers, lodges a protest to these few private tobacco shops that do not understand the greater good. We also request the local government to collaborate with the city's trade union to handle the matter promptly to achieve the goal of protecting workers' interests and developing production.

　　为邢市私营烟店压迫工人事
  　华北总工会筹委会提出抗议
  　请当地政府协同工会迅予处理以利生产
    【本报讯】华北总工会筹委会顷对邢台市久兴武、善兴成、积成等私营烟店，非法剥夺工人权益，提出抗议，原文如下：
    本会顷接太行报告，内称：邢市久兴武、善兴成、积成等私营烟店未与工人协议，擅自片面拟定单纯强调雇主一方利益之店规，以解雇工人，用饥饿、失业等手段，威胁工人，迫使工人屈服于雇主无理的约束之下，并从而借出门检查（实质上是搜查）侮辱工人人格；用限制外出“游玩”，堵住工人参与政治生活之机会，置工人于奴隶状态之下，以遂其高度剥削之贪欲。此等行为，不唯是严重的侵害工人利益，而且有违民主政府劳资两利、发展生产之政策。我华北总工会筹委员，对此异常愤慨，除对工人慰问外，特向该少数不明大义之私营烟店提出抗议。并请当地政府协同该市工会速予处理，以达保护工人利益、发展生产之目的。
