To all branches, reporters, and correspondents:

　　Please pay close attention to your connections with factories and industrial workers. Report on their production, lives, trade union activities, learning situations, and any demands and opinions they may have regarding their work. It is imperative to profoundly reflect their lives in a prominent manner. This is an extremely important political task. Please also pay attention to reporting on the establishment of industrial worker training classes or schools in various localities.
