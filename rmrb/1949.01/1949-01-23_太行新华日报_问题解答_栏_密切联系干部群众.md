　　Taihang Xinhua Daily "Question and Answer" Column
  　Closely Connect with Cadres and the Masses
    [Taihang Electric] In order to strengthen the close connection between the Party newspaper and the masses, the Xinhua Daily here specifically established a "Question and Answer" column in March and April of last year to solve various difficult problems raised by the masses and cadres. Over the past nine months, in addition to individual written replies, a total of 475 questions have been answered specifically in the newspaper. Among them, 130 questions related to land reform and Party rectification, 95 questions related to financial, grain, and diligent work burdens, 66 questions related to medicine and health, 85 questions related to production cooperation and mutual assistance, and 129 questions related to marriage and current affairs. Nine months of experience have proven that "Question and Answer" is not only an important method to strengthen the close connection between the Party newspaper and the masses, but also the best form to correctly and concretely implement the Party's policies, and is deeply welcomed by people from all walks of life, district and village cadres, and primary school teachers. Now, the column receives an average of 50 to 60 difficult questions from readers every day, and most of these questions are closely related to the central tasks of our various periods. Whenever there is a shift in our work, or when we promulgate a new decree or policy, there are particularly many inquiries about this aspect, which shows that the masses are very concerned about our Party's various policies and decrees. Other questions, such as marriage, production, agricultural knowledge, diseases, and current affairs terms, are also frequently asked, usually accounting for one-third of all inquiries. In order to correctly and carefully answer the difficult questions raised by readers, the newspaper not only has a dedicated editor to answer them, but also maintains close contact with relevant departments (such as the District Party Committee Office, the Administrative Office Health Department, the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, and the China University Veterinary Hospital) to answer them together. For example, some issues specifically stipulated in legal decrees such as burdens, diligent work, and marriage are transferred to the Administrative Office for answers. Medicine and health issues are answered by the Health Department and the China University Veterinary Hospital, respectively. For some practical rural problems, because the newspaper has a poor understanding of the situation in various places, they are transferred to local governments or Party committees for answers. In terms of answering methods, special problems that do not need to be answered publicly in the newspaper are answered by individual letters; for some problems that have district-wide significance, are more common, and are related to the current central work, a large space is used to answer them publicly in the newspaper. For these problems, not only must it be stated whether they are right or wrong, but the policies must be further clarified. For some individual and simple questions, readers are replied to by correspondence. However, no matter what form is used to answer, it must be cautious, affirmative, and accurate, avoiding ambiguous, lukewarm, or equivocal answers. Some problems that are not clear, it is better not to answer them. If incorrect, one-sided, or wrong statements are found, they should be explained and criticized. Over the past nine months, "Question and Answer" has played a great role. Many district and village cadres and primary school teachers regard "Question and Answer" as their teacher. For example, a primary school teacher in She County said: "If there is no Question and Answer to show us the way, we will have no way to solve problems for the masses. I am a teacher for elementary school students, and Question and Answer is my teacher."

### 太行新华日报“问题解答”栏　密切联系干部群众

　　太行新华日报“问题解答”栏
  　密切联系干部群众
    【太行电】此间新华日报为了加强党报和群众的密切联系，特于去年三、四月间开始专设“问题解答”一栏，解决群众干部所提出的各种疑难问题。九个月来，除个别写信答复者外，专门在报上答复的问题共四百七十五个。其中土改、整党等问题一百卅个，财粮勤工负担等问题九十五个，医药卫生问题六十六个，生产合作互助问题八十五个，婚姻、时事等一百廿九个。九个月的经验证明：“问题解答”不仅是加强党报和群众密切联系的重要方法，且是正确具体的贯彻党的政策的最好的形式，深受各界群众与区村干部、小学教员等欢迎。现在该栏每天平均可收到读者所提疑难问题五、六十件，而这些问题大多数都是和我们各时期的中心任务紧密联系的。凡在我们工作有所转换时，以及在我们颁布一种新的法令政策时，有关这方面的问题则询问的特别多，说明群众对我党的各种政策法令是十分关怀的。其他如婚姻、生产、农事知识、疾病、时事名词等，亦问的很多。通常占全部所询问题的三分之一。报社为了正确慎重的解答读者所提的疑难问题，除专设一编辑解答外，并与有关各部门（如区党委办公室、行署卫生处、农林局、华大兽医院等）取得密切联系，共同解答。如负担、勤工、婚姻等专门法令所规定的一些问题，即转交行署解答。医药卫生等即分别由卫生处、华大兽医院解答。对一些农村实际问题，因报社对各地情况了解差，所以即转交当地政府或党委机关解答。在解答方法上，一些不须在报上公开解答的特殊问题，即单独写信答复；对一些具有全区意义、较为普遍、且与当前中心工作有关的问题，则用大的篇幅在报上公开答复。对这些问题，不仅说明对不对，且在政策上要更加阐明。对一些个别的简单的问题，则用通信的方式刊复读者。但不论用何种形式来答复，一定要慎重、肯定、准确，避免似是而非、不痛不痒、模棱两可的答复。有些问题弄不清，宁可不答。发现不正确的、片面的错误的提法，应给予解释、批评。九个月来，“问题解答”起了很大作用。有许多区村干部、小学教员，把“问题解答”当成自己的老师。如涉县一个小学教员说：“要是没有问题解答给咱指明路，咱就没办法给群众解决问题。我是小学生的老师，问题解答又是我的老师。”
