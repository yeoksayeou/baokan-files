Introducing a Method for Preventing Chicken Plague
	I have a few experiences in raising chickens that I would like to share for everyone to study:
	Chickens invariably suffer from some form of plague once a year, but it's not certain when it will occur. It's most likely to appear in the spring, so we should prepare early for plague prevention. First, after the solar new year, accumulate some pig blood and plant some garlic sprouts. Dry the pig blood in the sun, and after the Lunar New Year, grind the pig blood into powder. Each time you feed the chickens, mix the pig blood at a ratio of 10% with the chicken feed. Before feeding the chickens, feed them the garlic sprouts first, about two inches per chicken each time. Second, do not put grass in the chicken coop. It is best to set up a chicken架 [jia, stand], to prevent the chickens from getting lice. If they already have lice, you can take boiling water, let it cool down to a warm temperature, and spray it on the chicken's face. This is a way to reduce heat in the chickens. The reasons for chickens getting lice are: first, due to the heat; second, because there is grass in the chicken coop. After the grass gets wet, the chicken manure will generate heat, which inevitably leads to lice.

　　介绍一个防鸡瘟的方法
    我对养鸡上，有几点经验，愿写出来，大家研究：
    鸡每年大小总有一次瘟，可是不一定落在什么时期，最肯发现的是春天，我们要早一点做防瘟的准备。第一、阳历年后即可积存一点猪血，栽些蒜芽，将猪血晒干，过旧历年就把猪血磨烂，每到喂鸡的时候，将猪血按鸡食的百分之十拌起；喂鸡前，将蒜牙可以先喂上，每顿可喂二寸（一个鸡）。第二、鸡窝里不要铺草，最好设一个鸡架，以免鸡生虱，如已有了鸡虱，可以拿开水凉温，喷在鸡的脸上，这是给鸡下火的一个办法。鸡生虱的原因：第一、因有火的关系。第二、就是因为鸡窝里有草，草湿了之后，鸡粪一发热，必然生虱。
