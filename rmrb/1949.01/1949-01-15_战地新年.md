　　Battlefield New Year
　　Lunchtime came, and the soldiers of the 7th Company enjoyed a hearty meal of four dishes. Xiong Xianguo, a new recruit who had just joined, happily sang a ditty: "This year's New Year is truly good, the Liberation comrades arrived just right, we're eating pork here, while the enemy gnaws on wheat seedlings there."
　　The fortifications were also decorated. Many road signs were put up in the communication trenches – “Forward Road”, “Victory Road”, and at the other end, there was even a “Merit Gate”. On both sides of the trenches, "Happy New Year" greetings and various Spring Festival couplets were made with cotton and sorghum stalks. Above the entrance of one dugout, four large characters were carved: "Go out and perform meritorious service." In the dugout of the first squad of the 8th Company, a conspicuous blue cloth was covered with New Year's resolution letters from the soldiers. A newly liberated soldier from Guangdong wrote on his resolution letter: "Fight back to my hometown, liberate the people, share warmth and food together, and enjoy peace again." On either side of the machine gun emplacement of the 6th squad of the 8th Company, which was at the very front, hung two bright red Spring Festival couplets: the upper line read: "Watch us celebrate the New Year bustlingly," and the lower line read: "See the enemy's deathly silence as they wait to die." Looking out from the gun emplacement, the enemy's bunker complex was submerged in the gray twilight, without a trace of vitality.

　　On the first morning of 1949, at the forward position of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army besieging the bandit troops of Du Yuming, the microphone played a light and cheerful New Year's song:
　　"Fresh, fresh, really fresh, celebrating the New Year together in bunkers and trenches, twist the Yangko, sing ditties, we wish our comrades a Happy New Year... New Year snowflakes fill the sky, we still practice drills in the trenches... Last year, victory reports flew everywhere, this year we must fight even better..."
　　After the New Year's song was finished, the microphone reported: "From dark last night to dawn today, more than ninety enemies surrendered at our regiment's position, including two major officers and many lieutenant-level officers...." The soldiers were all delighted and laughed.
　　Representatives of the 8th Company, disguised and wearing specially made small red hats, came to the 7th Company to offer New Year's greetings. Liu Hongqiao, the company commander of the 7th Company, greeted them, and the representatives said: "We are here to wish you a Happy New Year, you have to sing a ditty, or we won't leave." Company Commander Liu had never sung a ditty before, and at this moment he was both happy and embarrassed, but finally sang one: "Little red hat, bright red, the 8th Company is making a lot of progress, hoping you will perform great deeds this year." This made the representatives and everyone else burst into laughter.

　　战地新年
    开中午饭了，七连的战士们吃到丰盛四个菜。刚刚解放不久的新战士熊显国快乐的唱起快板来：“今年过年真正好，解放同志来得巧，我们这里吃猪肉，敌人那里吃麦苗。”
    工事也装饰起来了。交通沟里插上了许多路牌——“前进路”、“胜利路”，另一端还有“立功门”。在战壕两边两壁上，用棉花、秫秸片作出各式各样的“恭贺新禧”和各种春联。在一个掩蔽部的门口，横刻着四个大字：“出门立功”。在八连一班的掩蔽部里，一块显目的蓝布上，贴满了战士们的新年立功决心书。一个广东籍的新解放战士在他的决心书上写着：“打回老家去，解放人民，共同饱暖，再享太平。”八连六班最前沿的机枪工事的枪眼两边，贴着两幅鲜红的春联，上联是：“看我们热闹烘烘过年”，下联是：“见敌方死气沉沉等死”。从枪眼望去，敌人的地堡群正沉没在灰色的暮霭中，毫无半点生气。
    　　　　　　　　（新华社淮海前线十二日电）
    一九四九年的第一个早晨，在围困杜聿明匪部的解放军某团前哨阵地上，麦克风便唱出了轻松愉快的新年歌：
    “新鲜新鲜真新鲜，同在地堡战壕过新年，扭秧歌，唱快板，咱向同志们拜个年。………新年雪花飞满天，战壕里还把兵练，………去年到处飞捷报，今年更要打得好。……”
    唱完了新年歌，麦克风又报告消息：“本团阵地从昨晚天黑到今天天明，敌人来投降的有九十多，其中有少校军官二名和尉级军官多名。………”战士们听着都喜得笑开了。
    八连代表化了装，戴着特制的小红帽，到七连贺年来了。七连刘洪乔连长迎了出来，代表们说：“我们向你拜年，你得唱一段快板，不唱咱们不走。”刘连长从来也没有唱过快板，这时又高兴，又难为情，终于唱了一段：“小红帽，红通通，八连向上进步多，盼你今年立大功。”引得代表们和大家都哄然大笑。
