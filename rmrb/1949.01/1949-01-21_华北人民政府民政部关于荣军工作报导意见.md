Opinions of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the North China People's Government on Reports on Veteran Work

Comrade Editor:

After the North China Region Veteran Work Conference, although we did not promptly provide you with materials for reporting on this (we should review this), your newspaper's two proactive reports on the strengthening of veteran work have played a significant role in supporting the war, consolidating troop morale, expanding the influence of conscription, and promoting veteran work. However, occasional oversights and inaccuracies in the published articles are unavoidable. Regarding the communication on veteran work in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Central Hebei regions published in your newspaper on December 28th of last year, we would like to clarify some inappropriate points: At the North China Region Veteran Work Conference (held on November 27th of last year), the organizational management structure, principles, and tasks of future veteran work were thoroughly discussed, and unanimous decisions were made (Comrade Xiao Jia from your newspaper attended this meeting). These decisions were reviewed by the North China People's Government and subsequently promulgated or prepared for promulgation. The communication regarding Hebei-Shandong-Henan published in your newspaper completely repeated the content of the telegram published on December 2nd, but it differed from the decisions made at the North China Region Veteran Work Conference. It was acceptable to publish such reports before the decisions of the North China Region Veteran Work Conference were announced, but after the decisions were announced, publishing such articles again could easily cause confusion. For example, the report stated: (1) "The spirit of future veteran resettlement is basically decentralized home settlement." This is basically correct, but not complete, as it was also decided that "veterans from other provinces or those without a home in their native province will generally not be settled at the local level." (2) "The Veterans Management Office, in addition to accepting instructions from the North China Veterans Management Office,... is directly under the leadership of the Administrative Office in administrative matters and is part of the Administrative Office." However, the decision of the North China Region Veteran Work Conference was: "The Veterans Management Office of the Administrative Office will be renamed the Veterans Management Bureau and will carry out its tasks under the leadership of the Civil Affairs Department of the Administrative Office." Furthermore, the North China Veterans Management Office has long been determined to be a directly subordinate agency of the Ministry of Civil Affairs and has no leadership relationship with the Veterans Management Bureau of the Administrative Office, nor is it authorized to issue instructions externally. Moreover, the method decided by the Central Hebei Veteran Work Conference to remove the upper pockets of the military uniforms worn by veterans was considered inappropriate by the participants of the North China Region Veteran Work Conference. Since there is currently no capacity to issue new civilian clothes, the old uniforms can still be handled as before. The above items conflict with the unified decisions to be made in the future, so should a brief correction be published in the newspaper? Please consider and decide, and in the future, if you encounter any reports of this kind that you do not fully understand, we hope you will inquire to avoid any discrepancies.

Respectfully,

　Ministry of Civil Affairs of the North China People's Government

　　华北人民政府民政部关于荣军工作报导意见
    编辑同志：
    华北区荣军工作会议后，虽我们对此材料的报导没有及时供给你们（这一点我们应该作检讨），但贵报两次主动报导荣军工作加强情况，这对支援战争、巩固部队情绪、扩大参军影响及推动荣军工作，是起了很大作用的。但所登稿件，偶四考虑未周，容或失当亦所难免。谨将去年十二月二十八日贵报所登冀鲁豫与冀中荣军工作通讯内，有些不妥之处，特提出略加说明：按华北区荣军工作会议（去年十一月二十七日召开），关于今后荣军工作组织管理机构及方针任务，各方面均曾详加讨论，作出一致的决定（贵报肖甲同志曾参加此会），并于会后经华府审核，先后分别明令公布或准备公布。贵报所登关于冀鲁豫之通讯，与去年十二月二日所登之电讯内容，完全重复，但与华北区荣军工作会议所决定者尚有出入。在华北区荣军工作会议之决定未公布前，登载此种报导尚可，但荣军工作会议之决定已经公布，又复登出此类稿件，很易引起混乱。如报导内容：（一）“关于今后安置荣军基本上是分散安家的精神。”基本上是对的，但还不够完整，因还决定“外籍及本籍无家可归者，一般不向下安置。”（二）“荣管处除接受华北荣管处指示，……在行政上直属行署领导，是行署机关的一部分。”但华北荣军工作会议的决定是：“行署荣管处改为荣管局，在行署民政处领导下执行任务。”且华北荣管处早经确定为民政部的直辖机关，对行署荣管局并无领导关系，更无对外发指示的规定。又冀中荣军工作会议所决定的，对荣军所穿军服要拆去上面口袋的办法，此次华北荣军工作会议参加者都认为不妥当。目下既无换发新便衣之力，仍可照旧从权处理。以上各项有与今后统一决定者抵触之处，应否登报简明更正。请贵报斟酌决定，并望今后如遇关于此类报导稿件，倘有不甚了解之处，希垂询，以免发生纷歧。
    敬礼
    　华北人民政府民政部
