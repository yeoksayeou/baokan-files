[Hebei Jizhong News] The work of issuing land certificates in Shen County has been launched throughout the county. To ensure the smooth progress of filling out and issuing land certificates, the County Party Committee instructed all districts and villages to pay attention to solving the following problems at any time:

(1) Mobilize the masses to take out old deeds, but do not emphasize that land certificates will not be issued if old deeds are not taken out. In addition to mobilizing cadres and party members to take out old deeds first, it is necessary to emphasize to the masses: From now on, the government will handle matters according to the land certificates and protect the ownership of land property. All old documents will be invalid. Those who have documents should take them out. After registration, if the owner is willing to keep them, they can still be returned to the original owner for safekeeping. If they are not taken out now, they will be useless even if they are taken out later. After propaganda and explanation, if some people are still unwilling to take them out, it is not necessary to force them, so as not to delay the issuance of land certificates in order to pursue old documents.

(2) In the process of issuing land certificates, it is necessary to solve urgent problems that need to be solved, such as the division of houses, the division of threshing grounds, and compensation for middle peasants. Land certificates must be filled out and issued after the problems are solved. However, it is also not possible to deal with the problems of a few households in isolation, which will affect the progress of the entire village in issuing land certificates. Problems that have little impact on the issuance of land certificates should be left for later resolution.

(3) The following five specific issues should also be noted when filling out land certificates: 1. When filling in the entire family population in the land certificate, those who are doing business outside, according to the wishes of the masses, can also be filled in the land certificate, and the government does not restrict it. When paying burdens, it must be implemented in accordance with the burden methods stipulated by the government. 2. When filling in the attachments in the remarks column of the land certificate, mainly real estate, it must be clearly written according to the specific situation, such as toilets and pig pens in general courtyards can be omitted. 3. If some households have too much land and houses, and the number of grids on one land certificate is not enough, they can be filled in two. 4. When filling out and issuing land certificates, it is necessary to compile numbers from number one according to the number of households in the entire village, and arrange them downwards until one village is completed.

### 深县县委指示所属　发土地证不必强调收旧契

　　深县县委指示所属
  　发土地证不必强调收旧契
    【冀中讯】深县发土地证工作，已在全县展开，为使填发土地证顺利进行，县委指示各区村，应注意随时解决以下几个问题：
    （一）动员群众拿出旧契，但不要强调不拿出旧契就不发给土地证。除发动干部党员先拿出旧契外，要向群众强调指出：今后政府就按土地证办事，保护土地财产所有权，旧文书一律作废。有文书的拿出来，登记后本主愿意保存的，可仍交回原主保存，现时不拿出来，以后再拿也就不顶用了。经过宣传解释后，如有的仍不愿拿出，也不必强制，以免为追拿旧文书，耽误发土地证。
    （二）在发土地证中，必须解决急须解决的问题，如分房子、分场、补偿中农等，一定要在解决问题后，再填发土地证。但也不能光孤立的去处理几家的问题，影响全村发土地证的进行。对发土地证关系不大的问题，留待以后再解决。
    （三）填写土地证时还应该注意以下五个具体问题：一、在土地证内填写全家人口时，在外经商者，根据群众自愿，填入土地证内也可以，政府不加限制。纳负担时，必须依照政府规定的负担办法执行。二、土地证备考栏内填写附属品时，主要是房产，必须按具体情况写清楚，如在一般院落内的厕所、猪圈可以不写。三、如有的户土地房屋过多，一张土地证格数不够用时，可填写在两张内。四、填发土地证时必须按照全村户数，从一号开始编成号码，向下排列，至填完一村为止。
