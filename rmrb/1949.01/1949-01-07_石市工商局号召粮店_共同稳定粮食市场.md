Shijiazhuang Industry and Commerce Bureau Calls on Grain Stores
　　　　to Jointly Stabilize the Grain Market
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Industry and Commerce Bureau called on all grain stores in the city to jointly stabilize the grain market under the leadership of public enterprises and made two specific agreements based on the principle of taking care of appropriate profits: First, grain stores must be open for business every day and must not hoard and manipulate prices in an attempt to seek huge profits. If there is no grain, the People's Grain Store will be responsible for supplying it. Second, the current price of the People's Grain Store for high-quality rice is 5.8 yuan per jin, and wheat is 7.5 yuan per jin. Grain stores should take consistent steps in pricing. Millet should not exceed 6.1 yuan per jin, and wheat should not exceed 7.9 yuan per jin. Director Lu Yifu, in response to the many speculative mentalities currently occurring in the market, told all grain merchants that the government has sufficient grain to supply military and civilian needs, and the continuous and large-scale sale of grain by the People's Grain Store for several days is the most reliable evidence. The government does not want rising prices to affect people's lives, and honest merchants do not want rising prices to affect the preservation of real assets. Only speculative profiteers promote price fluctuations, and everyone must eradicate them.

　　石市工商局号召粮店
  　共同稳定粮食市场
    【石家庄讯】工商局号召全市粮店在公营企业领导下共同稳定粮食市场，并根据照顾适当利润的原则做了两项具体协议：第一粮店每天必须营业，不得囤积操纵，企图追求厚利。如没有粮食，由民众粮店负责供给。第二民众粮店现在上等米价每斤五元八角，小麦每斤七元五角，粮店价格要采取一致步调，小米不得超过六元一角，小麦不得超过七元九角。鹿毅夫局长针对目前市场上所发生的许多投机心理，告诉全体粮商，政府有足够的粮食供应军需民用，民众粮店一连数日和将继续大量抛售粮食是一个最可靠的证据，政府不愿物价上涨影响人民生活，正当商人也不愿物价上涨，影响实物保本，促使物价波动的只有投机奸商，大家一定要根除他。
