Xinhua News Agency, North China, 10th. Over a month after the issuance of the new currency by the People's Bank, it has been enthusiastically embraced by people across various regions, with everyone vying to collect the new currency. However, due to insufficient publicity and explanation at the time of issuance, it also raised certain doubts among some people. For instance, some wondered whether various local currencies would be discontinued and invalidated like the Kuomintang's "Legal Tender" after the issuance of the new currency. Others questioned whether the increased exchange rate of the new currency would lead to accelerated inflation, similar to the Kuomintang's "Gold Yuan." In response, our reporter interviewed Comrade Nan Hanchen, General Manager of the People's Bank, who made the following statement:

“Why did we issue regionally circulated local currencies in the past? And why are we now issuing a unified new currency from the People's Bank? The New China News Agency's editorial on December 5th provided a clear explanation. Recently, with the successive liberation of major cities and the complete integration of various liberated areas, the issuance of a unified new currency has proven to be urgently needed. The major cities we have liberated and will liberate, with the exception of Changchun and Shenyang in the Northeast, are junction areas of several liberated areas, that is, mixed circulation markets for several different local currencies. The large number of local currency types and differing exchange rates have caused great inconvenience to the people in these newly liberated areas. For example, the mixed circulation of various currencies near Tianjin and Xuzhou has created considerable market confusion, and people have been calling for the issuance of a unified currency to gradually withdraw local currencies. Therefore, it is not surprising that the new currency is eagerly collected by the people wherever it goes, and its credibility among the people is higher than any local currency.

“After the issuance of the new currency by the People's Bank, some people misunderstood and suspected whether the existing local currencies would be discontinued and invalidated like the Kuomintang's "Legal Tender." I can guarantee that no such thing will happen! The People's Government is not only responsible for the new currency of the People's Bank but also for all local currencies issued by the banks of the liberated areas in the past. In the future, when we withdraw local currencies, we will definitely redeem them according to the current prescribed exchange rates, down to the last note. The reason is very simple because the issuer of these currencies is not the Kuomintang government, which tries every possible means to exploit the people, but the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party, which protects the interests of the people at all times. Therefore, everyone can trust the various local currencies issued by the liberated areas in the past as much as they trust the new currency of the People's Bank, and should not alarm themselves!”

General Manager Nan continued: “The current appropriate increase in the exchange rate of the new currency of the People's Bank is justified because, due to the gradual rise in prices over the past decade, the current currency unit is too low and inconvenient for calculation. At the same time, the face value of the currency is too small, and wholesale transactions in cities often find it very difficult to count and tally. To meet the needs of large-scale urban transactions, it is necessary to issue notes with a relatively large denomination. The new 50-yuan note currently issued, although equivalent to 5,000 yuan of Jinnan currency or Beihai currency, seems large, but it is only worth about 5 jiao when converted into pre-war currency, which is still too small for large-scale transactions in cities. Therefore, we have decided to issue six denominations of new currency: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 20 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. In the old liberated areas, because there are already various local currencies that can temporarily replace small notes, we will first issue 10-yuan, 20-yuan, and 50-yuan new currency. Other new currency with smaller denominations will also be issued successively soon.

	Current price fluctuations have nothing to do with the issuance of the new currency.

“Does increasing the face value of notes equate to inflation? This is not the case at all. As long as we appropriately limit the amount of issuance, it will not cause prices to rise. Due to the victory of the war, our currency market has rapidly expanded, and many people in the newly liberated areas have automatically refused to use the Kuomintang's banknotes; the amount of currency in the liberated areas is insufficient, so market transactions often encounter great difficulties. However, in some areas, due to the large number of troops gathered and the difficulty of material supply, temporary price increases have occurred. This temporary phenomenon will definitely not last long, because Tianjin and other places will soon be liberated, the liberated areas are rapidly expanding, and markets everywhere will still acutely feel the lack of bargaining chips. Because the liberated areas are rich in materials, enough to supply the needs of major cities such as Tianjin, the issuance of currency will not turn into inflation. At present, only because the transportation and adjustment have not been organized perfectly, especially some speculative activities have not been effectively curbed, prices have experienced local and temporary fluctuations, and we are now working hard to restore them to stability. This phenomenon is difficult to completely avoid in large-scale wars and has nothing to do with the issuance of the new currency."

Finally, General Manager Nan explained: “The currency of our liberated areas is completely different from the Kuomintang's banknotes, and the facts of the past ten years have fully proven this. Recently, due to the rapid victory of the war and the imminent liberation of the whole country, the Kuomintang banknotes have rapidly collapsed, while the currency of the liberated areas has become more stable than in the past. In the past year, prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have risen more than a thousand times (prices rose fifty times before August 19th, and then rose twenty-five to thirty times after August 19th), while prices in our liberated areas, from the Northwest to Shandong, from North China to Central China, have only risen one to three times, and it is expected that this year will be more stable. The purpose of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "currency reform" is to plunder the people and accelerate inflation; while the completion of the currency unification work in our liberated areas is to facilitate the exchange of materials and the development of production, and to make our currency more consolidated. One side is victory, and the other side is failure; one side is consolidation, and the other side is collapse. This sharp contrast fully illustrates the completely different nature of the two currencies.”

　　人民银行总经理南汉宸发表谈话
  　新币发行极受人民拥护
  　部分人民某些疑虑已予详尽解答
    【新华社华北十日电】人民银行新币发行月余，获得各地人民热烈拥护，大家争先收藏新币。但因发行时的宣传解释不够，也曾引起了部分人民的某些疑虑。如怀疑新币发行以后，各种地方货币是否会象国民党的“法币”一样停兑作废？新币比价提高，是否会象国民党的“金圆券”一样加速膨胀？记者为此特访人民银行总经理南汉宸同志，承其发表谈话如下：
    “过去我们为什么要发行分区流通的地方货币？现在又为什么要发行统一的人民银行新币？十二月五日新华社的社论已有明白解释。最近由于各大城市次第解放，各解放区完全合成一片，统一的新货币的发行已证明是刻不容缓。我们已解放和将解放的各大城市，除东北的长春沈阳外，都是几个解放区的接合地区，也就是几种不同的地方货币的混合流通市场。由于地方货币种类太多，比价不同，使这些新解放地区的人民感到极大的不便。如平津附近和徐州附近各种货币混合流通，市场弄得相当混乱，人民纷纷要求改发统一货币，逐渐收回地方货币。因此新币所到之处，人民争先收藏，它在人民中的信用高于任何地方货币，这是丝毫不足奇怪的。
    “人民银行新币发行以后，有些人发生误会，怀疑原有的各种地方货币，是否会象国民党的“法币”一样停兑作废？我可保证决不会有这样的事情！人民政府不但对人民银行新币负责，而且对一切解放区银行过去所发行的地方货币负责。将来我们收回地方货币的时候，一定按照现在所规定的比价收兑，兑到最后一张为止。原因非常简单，因为发行这些货币的不是千方百计剥削人民的国民党政府，而是时时刻刻保护人民利益的共产党领导下的人民政府。所以大家可象信任人民银行新币一样，信任各解放区过去所发行的各种地方货币，切勿自相惊扰！”
    南总经理接着又说：“此次人民银行新币比价适当提高，理由是十余年来由于物价逐渐上涨，现行货币单位实在太低，不便计算。同时货币面额太小，城市中的批发交易，点票计数常常感到很大的困难。为着适应城市大宗交易需要，必须发行一点面额比较大的票子。现在所发行的五十元的新票，虽然折合冀南钞或北海币五千元，似乎很大，但是折合抗战以前的货币，只值五角上下，在城市的大宗交易中仍嫌太小。所以我们规定要发行一元、五元、十元、二十元、五十元、一百元六种票面的新币。在老解放区，因为已有各种地方货币可以暂时代替小票，所以我们先发行十元、二十元、五十元的新币。其它票面较少的新币，不久也将陆续发行。
    目前物价暂时波动与新币发行无关系
    “加大票子的面额是否即等于通货膨胀呢？这完全不是一回事情。只要我们适当限制发行数额，就不致于引起物价高涨。由于战争胜利，我们的货币市场迅速扩大，许多新解放区人民自动拒用国民党的纸币；解放区的货币数量不足，因此市场交易往往发生极大的困难。但亦有部分地区由于大军云集，物资供应困难，而发生了物价的暂时的高涨。这种暂时现象是决不会长久存在的，因为平津等地即将解放，解放区正迅速扩大，各地市场仍将痛感筹码不足。由于解放区物资丰富，足够供给平津等大城市的需要，所以货币的发行不会变为膨胀。目前仅因运输调剂尚未组织完善，特别是某些投机活动未予有力制止，因此物价发生了局部的、暂时的波动，现正努力设法使之恢复平稳。这种现象在大规模战争中是很难完全避免的，与新币的发行没有关系。”
    最后南总经理说明：“我们解放区的货币，与国民党的纸币截然不同，十年来的事实已经充分证明。最近一个时期由于战争迅速胜利，全国解放已经为期不远，因此国民党纸币迅速崩溃，而解放区的货币则较过去更为稳定。去年一年国民党统治区物价上涨了一千余倍（八一九前上涨了五十倍，八一九后又上涨了二十五倍至三十倍），而我解放区的物价，从西北到山东，从华北到华中，均仅上涨一倍到三倍，预料今年将更平稳。蒋匪实行所谓“币制改革”，目的是在掠夺人民，加速通货膨胀；而我解放区的完成货币统一工作，则为便利物资的交流和生产的发展，且使我们的货币更加巩固。这一边是胜利，那一边是失败；这一边是巩固，那一边是崩溃。这个鲜明的对照，就充分地说明了两种货币的完全不同的本质。”
