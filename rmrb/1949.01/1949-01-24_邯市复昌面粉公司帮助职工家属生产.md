Handan News: To take care of the interests of all employees and enable everyone to work with peace of mind and enthusiasm, the Fuchang Flour Company in Handan has undertaken many employee welfare initiatives. In July of last year, it called on employees to organize an employee cooperative. At that time, more than 30 people invested, raising a total of 1.5 million Jiao in capital. They hired people to engage in transportation. After making money, the shareholders and laborers divided the profits equally. In the first phase (July to September), three months, they earned more than 1.6 million. In the second phase, the number of investors increased to 50. Everyone said, "It's better to invest money, as earning money can solve a lot of difficulties." The second phase concluded at the end of December, earning more than 4.7 million. In order to solve the difficulties of some employees' families within the factory, from the time of resumption of work, family members were allowed to mend sacks and cut flour bags, earning more than four jin of rice per person per day. Up to now, for more than five months, some have earned up to 500,000, which has greatly solved the difficulties of employees' families and reduced the mental burden on employees. Recently, the factory also bought more than 3,000 jin of cotton and customized more than 20 spinning wheels, preparing to let family members spin thread to earn money.

In addition, a workers' consumer cooperative was established on January 13, specializing in buying daily necessities such as oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, rice, and flour, and selling them to workers at low prices for consumption.
