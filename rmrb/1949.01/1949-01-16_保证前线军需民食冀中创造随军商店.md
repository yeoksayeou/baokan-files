(Jizhong Electric Dispatch) To support the Pingjin Campaign, the Jizhong Longchang Store combined supplying the troops with the overall economic work of the war zone, providing convenience to both soldiers and civilians. After the liberation of Gu'an County on December 12th, the variety of local currencies created complexity. Counterfeit "Gold Yuan Certificates" had not been completely eliminated. In addition, speculative merchants arbitrarily set prices, purchasing goods at low prices. Individual units of our troops and individual local cadres took the opportunity to buy cheap goods. Merchants did not understand our price policy, resulting in price chaos and a semi-paralyzed market. Laborers and local people found it difficult to purchase daily necessities. Based on the above situation, the Jizhong Longchang Store obtained a batch of millet and corn from the government, and transported a large amount of white flour, salt, and vegetables. On December 13th, these were sold at fair prices at the Gu'an market, coupled with market propaganda, posting advertisements to promote our price policy and new district policies. From then on, prices began to fall. Millet fell from 20,000 Jizhong currency (hereinafter the same) per shi dou to 12,000 yuan. Cigarettes fell from 4,000 yuan per box to 2,500 yuan. As our local currency occupied the market, counterfeit "Gold Yuan Certificates" were no longer used. Children were playing with counterfeit "Gold Yuan Certificates" on the streets. The gains of the Jizhong Longchang Store in supporting the war prove that supporting the front lines requires not only a continuous supply of goods to the troops, but more importantly, supporting the market with goods. Stabilizing prices and supporting the local currency in such areas can quickly restore the market, stabilize the financial order, meet the needs of the broad masses of people, and at the same time unite the people and rely on the people to carry out large-scale support work. In the absence of cadres, we should boldly unite and organize legitimate merchants, and farmers should organize cooperatives to drive merchants to open businesses and quickly find employment.

(Jizhong Electric Dispatch) After inspecting the war zone, Luo Yuchuan, Director of the Jizhong Administrative Office, pointed out: "Mobile stores must combine supply departments with the overall economic work of the war zone." Because the economic situation in the Jizhong war zone (north of the Daqing River) was such that the economy had been severely damaged due to the past military plundering by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, combined with the exploitation of enemy currency, resulting in a lack of materials and the poverty of the people. In the vast new liberated areas, Chiang Kai-shek's currency had not yet been eliminated, and the local currency had not yet fully occupied the market, resulting in financial chaos, unstable prices, and fluctuating merchant sentiment, making them afraid to operate freely. Therefore, market transactions were in a state of semi-paralysis. In addition, large armies and support-the-front laborers gathered in the war zone, and the daily necessities of the large contingent had to be purchased locally. In order to open up the local currency front, appropriately control prices, solve military and civilian needs, and powerfully support the war, this situation must be quickly changed. Therefore, Director Luo pointed out that the task of mobile stores and banks in the war zone should be to vigorously stabilize prices, revitalize the economy, support the local currency to occupy the market, and combat speculation by certain merchants in the war zone market, so as to change the economic situation in the war zone, ensure military and civilian needs, and consolidate military-civilian unity. Economic work in the war zone is not only to supply the needs of the troops, but also to solve the needs of the large number of support-the-front laborers. Solving the difficulties of the army and laborers in the war zone must be achieved through stores and banks supplying materials, stabilizing prices, eliminating enemy currency, and encouraging merchants to revitalize market transactions. Only when prices are stable can transactions be active. At the same time, with the development of the victorious situation, to establish the prestige of the local currency in the market, it is necessary to correct the mechanical and simplistic approach of mobile stores only "supplying the troops" or simply "purchasing grain in preparation for entering the city." It is necessary to combine the task of supplying the troops, purchasing grain, and economic work in the war zone. Party committees, governments, trade, and banking departments at all levels must also work together to complete this task. Regarding specific practices, Director Luo pointed out: (1) Stores should take certain towns as bases, set up branches and stalls in the war zone, transport grain, oil, salt, and vegetables for sale, buy and sell grain, cooperate with local governments to publicize financial, trade, and industrial and commercial policies, mobilize and organize merchants to actively operate, and organize and support military-civilian food stalls and mass cooperatives, so that the army, laborers, and the poor can buy cheap goods. In conjunction with the local logistics headquarters, organize and support small restaurants at key points along the road, selling home-style meals, collecting grain coupons, and facilitating passing soldiers and laborers. (2) To control and stabilize prices, formulate price standards, and control reasonable prices, party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen the management and leadership of markets. (3) Banks should set up offices and business offices in the war zone to cooperate with stores in controlling prices, throwing out local currency to support stores, and stores using materials to support local currency. Chiang Kai-shek's currency should be publicized as about to be abolished, and poor farmers should be helped to withdraw Chiang Kai-shek's currency. (4) Transportation companies should support stores and use various means of transportation to transport materials. Transportation costs should not be too high and should be appropriately controlled.

　　保证前线军需民食冀中创造随军商店
    【冀中电】冀中隆昌商店，在支援解放平津战争中把供应部队与整个战地经济工作结合起来后，军民称便。十二月十二日固安县城解放后，因本币种类多，比较复杂，伪“金元券”尚未完全驱除，加以投机商人乱定价格，低价收购物资，及我个别部队和个别地方干部乘机买便宜货，商民不了解我物价政策，遂造成物价混乱，市场交易呈半停滞状态。民工和当地群众感到购买生活必需品的困难。冀中隆昌商店根据以上情况，从政府拨来一批小米、玉米，该店又运到大批白面、食盐、蔬菜。于十二月十三日固安集上平抑出售；并配合集市宣传，张贴广告宣传我之物价政策，新区政策。从此物价开始回跌，小米由每市斗二万冀钞（下同）降至一万二千元。纸烟由每盒四千元降至二千五百元。随着我本位币占领市场，伪“金元券”已无人使用。孩子们拿着伪“金元券”在街上玩耍。冀中隆昌商店在支援战争中的收获，证明商店支援前线不仅须以实物源源供给部队，更重要的以实物支援市场。稳定物价，支持本币在这种地区迅速恢复市场。稳定金融秩序，切合广大人民的需要，同时也可以此团结人民，依靠人民进行大规模的支前工作。在干部的缺乏情况下，应放手大胆的团结组织正当商人，农民组织合作社带动商家开张，迅速就业。
    【冀中电】冀中行政公署罗主任玉川视察战地归来后，指出：“随军商店必须把供应部与整个战地经济工作结合起来”。因为，冀中战地（大清河北地区）的经济情况，由于过去蒋傅匪军的军事掠夺，结合敌币榨取，已经严重的破坏了生产，造成物资的缺乏与人民的贫困。广大新解放区，蒋币尚未肃清，本币还未全部占领市场，形成金融混乱，物价不稳，商人情绪动荡，不敢放手经营。因此，市场交易处于半停滞状态。加以大军与支前民工云集战地，庞大队伍的日用品须就地购买。为打开本币阵地，适当掌握物价，解决军需民用，并有力地支持战争，就必须迅速改变此种情势。因此，罗主任指出：战地随军商店、银行的任务，应以大力稳定物价，活跃经济，支持本币占领市场，打击在战地市场某些商人的投机，以达改变战地经济情况，保障军需民用，巩固军民团结的目的。战地经济工作不只是供应部队所需，还要解决庞大支前民工的需要。解决军队、民工在战地生活上的困难，必须通过商店、银行供应物资，稳定物价，扫除敌币，带起商人活跃市场交易。也只有物价稳定了，交易才能活跃。同时，随着胜利的形势的开展，树立本币在市场上的威信，必须纠正随军商店只是“供给部队”或单纯“收购粮食准备进城”的机械的简单作法。要把供给部队，收购粮食，与战地经济工作的任务结合起来，各县、市党委、政府、贸易、银行等部亦必须协同动作，完成此一任务。关于具体作法，罗主任指出：（一）商店要以一定市镇为基地，在战地设分店和小摊，调运粮、油、盐、菜出售，买卖粮食，配合当地政府宣传金融，贸易，工商政策，发动与组织商人积极营业，组织与支持军民饭摊食品站及群众合作社，使军队、民工、贫民能买到便宜东西。结合当地后勤指挥部，组织与支持要路点的小饭馆，卖家常便饭，收用粮票，便利过往军人及民工。（二）掌握稳定物价，拟定物价标准，掌握合理的价格，各级党委及政府，要加强对集市的管理与领导。（三）银行应在战地分设办事处、营业所，配合商店掌握物价，抛出本币支持商店，商店用物资支持本币。对蒋币应宣传其即将作废，帮助贫苦农民推出蒋币。（四）运输公司支持商店，利用各种运输工具运送物资。运费不宜过高，要作适当掌握。
