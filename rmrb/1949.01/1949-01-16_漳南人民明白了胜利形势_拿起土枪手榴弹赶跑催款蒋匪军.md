　　Taixing Electric News: The entire Zhangnan County conducted a large-scale current affairs propaganda campaign in December. After the slogan "Fundamentally overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary government in about a year" spread to every corner of the county, the masses' enthusiasm for active production and support for the front line greatly increased. During the propaganda campaign, all market towns throughout the county displayed national flags, built high arches, and hung lanterns and decorations. Many villages spontaneously performed Yangko dances and stilt walking, expressing their joyful mood. The masses generally discussed and said: "Chiang Kai-shek, this old traitor and old feudalist, is about to fall completely!" The masses deeply believed that the Kuomintang reactionary government could be fundamentally overthrown in about a year. In the forward areas, many people voluntarily stated at mass meetings that they had donated money to the enemy in the past and were willing to prove that they were not loyal to the enemy by actively fighting against the enemy in the future. When enemy plainclothes teams went to demand payment, the masses automatically resisted and refused to pay. When they went to demand payment for the second time, the masses took up rifles and hand grenades to drive the enemy away. The phenomenon of aiding the enemy, which was more serious in the previous period, has now been greatly reduced. A small number of bad elements in the villages are now subject to spontaneous supervision and sanction by the masses. In a certain village, seven landlord households reneged on a portion of land, which was automatically reclaimed by the peasants. Many pseudo-family members are using various relationships to "call for husbands and claim children." Those returning from Anyang city are arriving in an endless stream every day. Encouraged by victory, the masses in the consolidated areas have a high enthusiasm for winter production. Various workshops, businesses, transportation, saltpeter boiling, etc., are increasing day by day. Li Baoxing from Zhang Baishu Village in the Fifth District said to his wife: "The situation will definitely not change. We must plan for the long term." Many intellectuals in the countryside have also begun to come out to participate in revolutionary work. The short-term training class for intellectuals run by the county government started on the 8th of last month with nearly a hundred people. General merchants also believe: "In the future, we will have more freedom and be able to do better business." The reason is that in the current affairs propaganda, various basic policies of our party were widely explained, various rumors of the enemy were exposed, and it was closely combined with specific work such as armed self-defense and production development. The reason why this propaganda was relatively successful was that a meeting of the main cadres of each district was convened beforehand to make specific arrangements; and meetings of all county cadres, primary school teachers, district and village cadres, militia meetings, and even county-level agency cadres and miscellaneous personnel were convened separately to first explain the current affairs to them, and at the same time put forward the specific requirements of "everyone doing propaganda" and county and district cadres personally speaking. The second step was to convene mass meetings with a focus, combined with general village and town propaganda, striving for universality; finally, meetings of enemy families and returning escapees were convened. In terms of propaganda methods, the characteristics of the countryside were taken into account: in addition to holding meetings, mass blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, newspapers, maps, and exhibitions of captured military officer photos were widely used. In this current affairs propaganda, there are still the following three main shortcomings: first, it is not deep enough and has not achieved the organizational effect it should have. Second, the propaganda of policies in a few places is not comprehensive and appropriate enough, and there are even some errors. Third, it has failed to lay the foundation for regular propaganda and education of the masses in the future through this propaganda. We are now studying corrections in order to improve our future propaganda and education work for the masses.

　　漳南人民明白了胜利形势
  　拿起土枪手榴弹赶跑催款蒋匪军
    【太行电】漳南全县在十二月份曾进行大规模的时事宣传运动。经过宣传“一年左右从根本上打倒国民党反动政府”的口号传到全县各个角落，群众积极生产与支援前线的热忱大为提高。在宣传运动中，各集镇遍县国旗，高搭牌楼，悬灯结彩，不少村庄自动出演秧歌、高跷等，表达他们的愉快情绪。群众普遍议论着说：“蒋介石这个老汉奸，老封建，眼看要连根倒了！”对于再有一年左右即可从根本上打倒国民党反动政府，群众深信不疑。在前沿区，有不少群众自动在群众会上声明过去曾给敌人捐送款，愿在今后积极对敌斗争中来证明自己并不是忠于敌人的。当敌便衣队去催款时，群众自动抗款不交；第二次去催时，群众便拿起土枪和手榴弹把敌人赶跑。前一时期曾较为严重的资敌现象，现已大为减少。村中少数坏分子，现已受到群众自发的监督和制裁。某村有七户地主倒算去一部土地，又为农民自动收回。不少伪属正在利用各种关系“唤夫索子”。自安阳城内归来者，每天络绎不断。已巩固区的群众在胜利鼓舞下，冬季生产情绪很高。各种作坊、买卖以及运输、熬硝等日见增多。五区张柏树村李保兴，对他女人说：“天决不会变了，咱们一定要往长久打算。”不少在乡知识分子亦已开始出来参加革命工作。县政府开办的知识分子短期训练班，于上月八日开始时已近百人。一般商人亦认为：“今后腿长了，好作买卖了。”原因是在时事宣传中，同时广泛的说明了我党各种基本政策，揭破了敌人各种谣言，并与武装自卫、开展生产等具体工作密切结合起来。这次宣传所以做得比较有成效，原因是事前曾召开了各区主要干部会议，具体布置；并分别召集了全县干部会、小学教员会、各区、村干部会、民兵会、乃至县直属机关干部与杂务人员会议，首先向他们讲明时事，同时提出“人人作宣传”和县、区干部亲自动嘴的具体要求。第二步，即有重点的召开群众大会，结合一般的村镇宣传，力求普遍；最后召集敌军家属会，逃亡归来户会，在宣传方式上，照顾了农村特点：除召开会议外，并广泛运用了大众黑板、屋顶广播、报纸、地图、俘虏军官照片展览等方式。在这一时事宣传中，也还存在以下三个主要缺点：一是不够深入，尚未能收到应有的组织效果。二是少数地方对于政策的宣传还不够全面、恰当，甚至还有一些错误。三是未能经过这一宣传，打下今后经常宣传教育群众的基础。现正在研究改正，以便提高今后对群众的宣传教育工作。
