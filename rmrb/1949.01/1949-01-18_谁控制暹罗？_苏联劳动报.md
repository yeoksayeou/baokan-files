　　Who Controls Siam?
　　“Soviet Labor News”
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. TASS, Moscow, 9th: The Labor News published an article today entitled "Who Controls Siam," stating that due to direct pressure from the United States, Britain's traditional monopoly on Siamese raw materials has been greatly damaged since the war. Currently, the control of Siam's main strategic materials, tin and rubber, and almost all of Siam's exports, has been seized by American monopoly capitalists. Before the war, all of Siam's exports went to British Malaya. Today, the United States directly purchases in Siam. In the past, goods were transported by British ships; today, American ships directly transport tin and rubber to the United States. In the first nine months of last year, exports to the United States amounted to $55 million, compared to only $13 million in 1947. In the past, Siam was bound by the pound sterling group; today, it is trading with other countries using US dollars. The sharp increase in the number of American companies in Siam proves that the expansionist policy of American monopoly capitalists has penetrated deeply into Siam. Before the war, Siam had only two American companies; now there are thirty. Two American oil companies—Mobil and Texaco—are competing with the British Shell Oil Company. American businessmen are so brazen that even the Siamese right-wing newspaper "Siri Phalakorn" had to sound an alarm. The newspaper recently wrote: "Americans are pouring into Siam, similar to the way Europeans invaded the American West in the old days. Every plane arriving in Siam is filled with American businessmen and adventurers."

　　The presence of a large number of Americans, American intelligence agencies, and foreign advisors in Siam indicates that Siam is in a semi-colonial state of dependence on imperialism. To date, Siam has two foreign advisors occupying high positions in the government: an American, Baden, working in the Siamese Foreign Ministry, and an Englishman, Roell, working in the Siamese Ministry of Finance. These two advisors almost control the entire Siamese economic and political life. Sorter, the former president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Siam, was recently appointed as an economic advisor. This proves that Siam is becoming increasingly dependent on the United States.

　　The growing national liberation movement in Southeast Asia is shaking the foundations of imperialist countries. Imperialists are using open terror against people fighting for national sovereignty. The United States is shipping arms to Siam. Britain is also sending arms for the same purpose. According to the British Daily Telegraph Morning Post, the British government has decided to equip eight battalions of troops for Siam. Measures to equip the Siamese air force will also be taken in the near future. The US ambassador to Siam stated that requests for assistance (including arms) from Southeast Asian countries to the United States will be considered "urgently" by Washington. However, in using a policy of force, the imperialists have forgotten that the era of deceiving the people is gone forever. The working people of Siam are increasingly recognizing a truth from these facts: that breaking free from foreign shackles and seeking liberation is the only way to guarantee Siam's independence and freedom.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Bangkok: Under the participation of the US Military Attaché to Bangkok, Thorne, British and Siamese military delegations held a series of meetings in Songkhla, southern Siam, earlier this month to discuss a joint plan to deal with the people's guerrillas on the Siamese-Malayan border. As of the 9th, "The British and Siamese delegations have agreed that the British and Siamese armies, air forces, and police will coordinate operations on the Siamese-Malayan border" (Agence France-Presse). A communiqué issued by the Siamese side in Songkhla stated: "The Songkhla British-Siamese conference is proceeding satisfactorily." The British representatives attending the meeting included General Bourchier and Colonel Police Officer Gray; the Siamese representatives included Lieutenant General Police Officer Kosol.

　　The British-Siamese Songkhla Conference with US participation is a further development of the conference of British envoys to Southeast Asian countries convened by the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, in Singapore last November. After the last conference, MacDonald, accompanied by the British Far East Commander Leese, went to Bangkok and signed a secret "anti-communist" pact with the Siamese fascist leader Luang Phibunsongkhram.

### 谁控制暹罗？　“苏联劳动报”

　　谁控制暹罗？
  　“苏联劳动报”
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：劳动报今日刊载题为“谁控制暹罗”的论文称：由于美国的直接压力，英国对暹罗原料的传统垄断，在战后已大受损害。目前对暹罗的主要战略物资锡与橡胶及暹罗的几乎全部出口的控制，已为美国垄断资本家攫去。战前，暹罗的出口全部输往英属马来亚。今天，美国直接在暹罗采购。过去，商品由英国船只运出，今天，美国船只直接运输锡与橡胶到美国去。去年头九个月中，对美输出为五千五百万美元；一九四七年仅为一千三百万美元。过去，暹罗处在英磅集团国家的束缚下；今天，它正用美元和别的国家贸易。暹罗国境内美国公司数目的激增，证明了美国垄断资本家的扩张政策已深入暹罗。战前暹罗仅有两家美国公司，现在则有三十家。两家美国石油公司——美孚公司及德士古公司和英国贝壳牌石油公司竞争着。美国商人是如此放肆，致使暹罗右翼报纸“色里拍罗报”都不得不发出报警的信号。该报最近写道：“美国人正在涌入暹罗，和旧时欧洲人侵入美国西部旷野的情况相似。每架到达暹罗的飞机，都载满了美国商人和冒险家。”
    人数众多的美国人、美国情报机关及外国顾问在暹罗的存在，标志着暹罗处在对帝国主义依赖的半殖民地状态中。迄今为止，暹罗已有两个外国顾问盘据着政府的高位：一为美人巴登，任职于暹罗外交部；一为英人罗尔，任职于暹罗财政部。这两个顾问，几乎控制着整个暹罗经济与政治生活。前暹罗美国商会会长索特，最近亦被任命为经济顾问。这证明暹罗正愈来愈依赖美国。
    日益增长的东南亚民族解放运动，正在敲击着帝国主义国家的基础。帝国主义者们正在使用公开的恐怖对付为国家主权而战的人们。美国正在运送军火到暹罗。英国也运去军火用于同一目的。据英国每日电讯晨邮报称：英国政府已决定为暹罗装备八个营的军队。在最近将来也将采取装备暹罗空军的措施。美国驻暹罗大使会称：东南亚各国向美国提出的关于援助（包括军火）的请求，将被华盛顿“急切”地加以考虑。但是，在使用武力政策时，帝国主义者们忘记了欺骗人民的时代，已经一去不复返了。暹罗劳动人民已从这些事实中愈来愈加认清一个真理，即：挣脱外国的羁绊与求得解放，是保证暹罗的独立与自由的唯一方法。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】曼谷讯：在美驻曼谷军事参赞索恩参加之下，英暹两国军事代表团于本月上旬在暹罗南部的宋卡城举行一系列的会议，讨论共同对付暹罗、马来亚边境人民游击队的计划。迄九日止，“英暹两国代表团已同意英暹两国陆军、空军及警察，在暹马边境配合行动”（法新社）。暹方在宋卡发表的公报曾称：“宋卡英暹会议正圆满进行中”。参加会议的英方代表包括鲍奇尔将军及上校警官格雷：暹罗代表包括中将警官科索尔。
    美国参加下的英暹宋卡会议，是去年十一月英驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳在新加坡召开的英驻东南亚各国使节会议的进一步发展，在上次会议后，麦氏曾偕英远东军司令李琪赴曼谷，与暹罗法西斯头子銮披汶订立了“反共”密约。
