Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 28th—In order to cultivate a large number of worker cadres and truly make the working class the main force in urban construction, the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently opened the Zhengzhou Workers' School. The first phase of the school officially started on the 18th of this month. There are currently 435 students enrolled, including 350 railway employees and 85 workers and staff from other public enterprises such as postal and telecommunications. The study period is tentatively set for one month. The school plans to hold two phases by March this year, training a total of 2,000 people. The study content is divided into three parts: current affairs, policies, and political education. Teachers are hired by the school and concurrently serve as responsible personnel from various agencies in Zhengzhou. During the study period, all books and stationery for students are provided by the school. Employees from their work posts continue to receive their original salaries. Those whose monthly salary is less than 180 catties of wheat will have it supplemented by the school. Food expenses are self-provided. For workers who are unemployed upon enrollment, the school provides food and also gives pocket money. Any male or female employee who is 18 years old or older, healthy, and without bad habits may apply for admission. They are recommended by the trade union and, after being examined and approved by the school, can be admitted to study.
