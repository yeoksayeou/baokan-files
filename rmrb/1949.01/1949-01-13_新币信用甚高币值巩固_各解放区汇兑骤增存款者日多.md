　　The new Currency Has High Credit and Consolidated Value
  　Exchange in Various Liberated Areas Increases Sharply, and Depositors Increase Daily
    [Our Newspaper's report] Since the issuance of the new currency by the People's Bank of China on December 1st of last year, it has achieved significant results in promoting material exchange within the Liberated Areas, accelerating currency circulation, and facilitating the development of production. For example, before the issuance of the new currency, the exchange relationship between the Dezhou Liberated Area in Shandong and the North China Liberated Area was only with Shijiazhuang. Within a few days of the new currency's issuance, it increased to as many as eight locations. In terms of the amount of exchange: the total amount of remittances sent and received by the Shijiazhuang branch of the People's Bank of China in late November of last year was 34,469,419.74 new currency yuan, which increased to 43,959,433.3 new currency yuan in early December, an increase of 27%; among them, the total amount of remittances to and from Shandong in late November was 7,788,900 yuan, which increased to 8,131,500 yuan in early December, an increase of 4.6%.
    In addition, after the issuance of the new currency, the credit of the state bank was further consolidated, as reflected in the increasing amount of deposits. In early December, the total amount of deposits in state banks in the entire North China region increased by 60% compared to late November.
    Another aspect of the consolidation of the new currency is the unprecedented increase in the exchange rate of our currency against foreign currencies. In late November of last year, one new currency yuan was only worth 0.314 of the puppet "Gold Yuan Certificate," but by December 9th, it had risen to 0.4, an increase of 27.4%. By December 22nd, one new currency yuan was worth 1.25 of the puppet "Gold Yuan Certificate," more than three times higher than the day before the new currency was issued. (Wang Zeng)

　　新币信用甚高币值巩固
  　各解放区汇兑骤增存款者日多
    【本报讯】自去年十二月一日中国人民银行新币发行以来，在促使解放区内地物资交流，加速货币流转，便利发展生产上曾得到显著的成效。例如，山东德州解放区与华北解放区的汇兑关系在新币发行之前只有石家庄一地，自新币发行以后短短几天内就增加至八处之多。以汇兑数额来看：去年十一月下旬石家庄中国人民银行分行的汇出汇入总额为新币三千四百四十六万九千四百一十九元七角四，至十二月上旬就增至四千三百九十五万九千四百三十三元三，增加百分之二十七；其中对山东汇出汇入总额在十一月下旬为七百七十八万八千九百元，至十二月上旬增至八百一十三万一千五百元，增加百分之四·六。
    另外，新币发行后，国家银行信用的更趋巩固，表现在存款额的日益增长，十二月上旬华北全区国家银行的存款总额比十一月下旬增加百分之六十。
    新币巩固的另一面，是本币对外价格的空前提高，去年十一月下旬新币一元只比伪“金圆券”三角一分四，至十二月九日就上升至四角，提高了百分之二十七·四，至十二月二十二日新币一元比伪“金圆券”一元二角五，与新币发行前一天比较提高了三倍多。（王增）
