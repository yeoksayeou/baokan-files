Female yarn doffers A, B, C

Time: About half a year after liberation, one day around 11 a.m., close to the workers' mealtime.
Location: Workers' rest area outside the maintenance department of a public yarn factory in Shijiazhuang, where fine yarn maintenance workers often try to assemble machine frames.
Scene: A door on the left side of the stage leads to the maintenance department, and a large door on the front left leads to the fine yarn room. Outside the maintenance department is a tea stove, and on the left side of the stage is a low, long table and several long benches for workers to eat. On the right side of the stage, a fine yarn frame is being renovated, with parts, oil drums, oil cans, etc. nearby. There are three or four lunch boxes on the dining table.

Opening: San Buguan, Zheng Yi, and the Group Leader are working hard around the machine frame. Erhun is wiping parts on the side, dozing off. After a short pause, Zheng Yi looks up and sees Hun.

Zheng (pointing at Hun) That kid Erhun is dozing off again! He must not have done anything good last night!
San (dissatisfied) No need to say, he probably went to see a play again!
Hun (woken up, not admitting it) Did you see me go to see a play!?
Zu (seriously) Erhun! This machine will be started next week, and many workers are waiting to start work! At the rate you are slacking off, when will you be able to assemble it all? We should be more proactive!
Hun (throwing the rag used to wipe parts in his hand and muttering) How much does being proactive cost per pound! (Sits on the eating bench, takes out a cigarette, crosses his legs, and leisurely lights it) Damn it, I'm going to exercise democracy, take a smoke first! (Starts smoking)
(From backstage, a female worker calls out in a drawn-out voice: "Hey! This spindle is burning hot! Come and add oil!")
Zu (to Hun) Erhun! The spindle outside is out of oil, go add some!
Hun (indifferently) Humph!…
(From backstage, another call: "Hurry up and add oil! This is spinning empty tubes!")
Zu (urging) Hurry up and go, Erhun!
(Erhun lazily picks up the oil can, oil dripping from the spout)
Zu (admonishing) Erhun! Don't spill all the oil on the ground, spindle oil is quite scarce right now, do you know how much it costs per pound!
Hun (glancing sideways) I don't know!? 198,500 yuan per pound—I don't know?!
Zheng (surprised by Hun's familiarity with the market) You know quite a bit, kid!
Hun (regretfully covering up) Ah! I just heard it from the material depot… (exits)
Zheng (to Zu) Group Leader, look at this kid Erhun, he's energetic when it comes to watching plays and eating out, but he has no spirit when it comes to working. He even said that he'll let his wife work on this machine once it's assembled, but if everyone is like him, when will it ever be assembled!
San Who cares, anyway, it's not your wife or my wife, it's none of our business whether she works or not. If we say too much, we'll offend people, it's not worth it!
Zu (sighing) That Zhang Da Niang in the cotton inspection department is so good, but she raised such a slacker son.
San Isn't that because he's her only son, Zhang Da Niang has spoiled him since he was little!
Zheng Don't say that, Buguan. Ever since liberation, Zhang Da Niang has been much stricter with him than before, afraid he won't work hard!… Zhang Da Niang's awareness has increased so quickly.
Zu Isn't that because she benefited from the factory!
San
Zheng (disagreeing) Haven't you benefited from the factory? This public factory is our own factory now, look! Isn't everyone's life better than before, how can you say such heartless things!
(The dinner bell rings outside)
(Zhang Da Niang enters carrying a teapot and lunch box)
Niang (to everyone) It's time, time to eat, why are you still working? (Walks to the tea stove, pours water.)
Zheng Ah: Just as we were talking about Zhang Da Niang, here you come, Zhang Da Niang!
(Niang finishes getting water, puts the pot on the table, sits down, and starts eating.)
Niang Well, come on, the bell rang a while ago, why are you still working so hard?
Zu It doesn't matter if we eat a little later, we're still waiting to start this machine next week!
San Zhang Da Niang, I heard your Erhun's wife is going to work too!
Niang Yes, Erhun's wife registered at the union the day before yesterday. The head of the maintenance department promised her that she can start working as soon as this machine is assembled.
Zheng (lively) That's right, for the sake of you, Zhang Da Niang, we have to work even harder!
Niang (smiling gratefully) That would be great! That would be great!…
(Erhun enters with an oil can)
Hun (impatiently to everyone) Hey, it's time to eat! (Puts down the oil can, wipes his hands with a rag, seeing that no one is paying attention, mutters to himself) Eat or not, I don't care about you, I'll eat first. (Sits down and eats)
Niang Look how impatient you are!
Zu (to everyone) Alright! Alright! Let's stop working, eat first and then work!
(Everyone stops working, puts down the parts, wipes their hands with a rag, and goes to the dining table)
Niang Everyone, eat some of mine!
Everyone Same to you. (Sits down to eat)
San (takes off his shirt and puts it on the table) It's really hot…
Zu (kindly) Zhang Da Niang, I think you look much better these days.
Zheng Yes, Zhang Da Niang, you just recovered from your illness, why don't you rest for a few more days before coming to work?
Niang Well! The head of the maintenance department said the same thing, he also advised me to rest for a few more days when I came to work that day. I feel like I've rested enough days, and I've eaten enough, we're used to working, we can't really sit still; besides, I'm not happy just resting!
San Zhang Da Niang, that illness must have cost you a lot of money, right?
Niang How could it not!—Like me, being sick for five or six months straight, skinny as a rake, looking like I was about to kick the bucket, luckily the Communist Party came to save me. Now the public runs the factory, and it's not the same as before. The factory sent me to the hospital and took care of me for a month. The injections and medicine were all paid for by the factory. I don't even know how much it cost, but even if it was less, it must have been two or three hundred thousand.
Zu (sighing) Now, when workers are sick, the factory pays for treatment. If the Kuomintang were still here, who would care about us!
Niang (angrily) Kuomintang!! If the Kuomintang hadn't fired me, I wouldn't have gotten this illness! Just because I was sick and took a few extra days off, they didn't want me anymore. They wanted me to die and couldn't wait, and they'd send me to the hospital? If those Kuomintang bastards were still here, my old life would have been gone long ago, not to mention staying in the hospital, I wouldn't even be able to enter the hospital gates.
Hun (although backward, he still hates the oppression of the Kuomintang) Back then, the hospital was reserved for the rich and powerful, we poor workers deserve to enter the hospital? – If you're sick, you die, that's your fate!
Zheng (jokingly to Hun) Yes, Zhang Da Niang's recovery from this serious illness is really a great blessing for you! Now you've also gotten a wife, Zhang Da Niang only has you as this precious child, let's just see how you two young people take care of her!
Niang (gratefully) Just take Erhun getting married this time, as soon as I mentioned it to the factory director, he didn't even hesitate and immediately issued a note to borrow 500,000; before liberation, not to mention borrowing money from the factory director, we couldn't even get a word in with them. If we got too close to them, they'd pinch their noses and say we stink.
San Before, we couldn't even get food in our mouths, no one cared, how could they care about getting married?
Zu Look how many new wives the workshops have gotten since liberation, Zhang Da Niang, you've finally become a mother-in-law!
Niang After suffering for half my life, getting him a wife now is finally a relief.
Zheng (joking) Erhun, why aren't you working harder? Such a good wife is wasted on you? It's really like a flower stuck in dog poop!
Hun (covering up his happiness, chasing and hitting Zheng) I deserve it—you can't even find one if you want one!…
Zu Hey! Stop fooling around, eat quickly! We still have work to do after eating!
Niang (to Hun) Really, you can't even eat properly!
San Erhun, you get energetic as soon as your wife is mentioned!
Zheng Hey, stop fooling around, stop fooling around, (runs a lap and is out of breath from the heat) It's really hot from running, I'll take it off before eating.
(Takes off his clothes and touches the adjustable wrench in his pocket)
Zheng (suddenly remembering) Oh! I was so busy fooling around, I forgot the important thing—I brought an adjustable wrench this morning, planning to hand it in to the factory, but I forgot. Group Leader, what do you think I should do?
Zu Where did you get the adjustable wrench?
Zheng (playfully) I stole it!
Everyone (surprised) Stole it?!
Niang (concerned) Why are you still stealing now?
Zheng (jokingly) You only listen to the beginning and not the end—when the Kuomintang was here, I couldn't eat enough, I couldn't wear enough, why wouldn't I steal from them!
Everyone (relieved) After all that, you stole it back then!
Zheng That day I stole it, wanting to take it to West Garden to sell and exchange it for three catties of corn flour to eat, who knew the People's Liberation Army would attack and liberate Shijiazhuang the next day, so I didn't sell it, and it's been kept until now.
Hun (enviously) Why don't you sell it now, it's worth even more than before now!
Zheng Now I get 250 catties of millet a month, the factory issued a purchase permit, and I can buy rice, flour, cloth, oil, and salt at an 80% discount, I have more than enough to eat and drink, why would I sell it? Besides, the factory is assembling machines right now, these are things we use, wouldn't it be more convenient for everyone to take it out?
Niang (praising) You are such a good kid! Hurry up and hand it in!
Zu That's right, quickly hand it in to the maintenance department. So many people have handed in things these days, and they've all been praised. If you hand it in, they'll definitely put up a sign for you in a while!
San (naive economic view) Yes, hand it in, such an adjustable wrench is worth hundreds of thousands now!
Zheng Good! You guys eat first, I'll go hand it in now! (exits)
Niang (looking at Zheng Yi's back and sighing) Now the workers are really enlightened, so many people have handed in steel rings and parts these days!
Zu Zhang Da Niang, you don't know, Zheng Yi wasn't like this before; when the Kuomintang was here, he had two minds when he entered the factory, one mind was only paying attention to the section chief, and the other mind was only thinking about stealing. As soon as the section chief entered the factory, he would take a wrench and tighten the screws that others had already tightened. As soon as the section chief left, he would drop the wrench and sneak away, steal some yarn at the spinning frame, take a few tassels at the fine yarn frame. If our maintenance department got some valuable furniture, he would copy it in three or two days. This adjustable wrench was stolen back then!
Niang Who didn't try to make ends meet back then, they kept a close watch all day long, anyway, no one could just wait to starve to death. Don't you remember, back then, after midnight on the night shift, the latrines were full, some were taking a dump here, some were sleeping there, so crowded that there wasn't even a place to put your feet. It's not like now, when workers work so happily! On Sundays, workers even rush to work overtime. Now you assemble machines for eight hours and do more work than you used to do in twelve hours. Just take this kid Zheng Yi, he's completely different from before!

　　反对三只手
    （独幕话剧）
    （繁荣厂职工集体创作鲁煤、陈森执笔）
    人物
    张二混（简称混）十八岁，细纱保全学徒工
    张大娘（简称娘）四十五岁，检棉部老工人，二混的母亲
    三不管（简称三）三十岁，细纱保全工人
    郑义（简称郑）二十三岁，细纱保全工人
    组长（简称组）三十五岁，细纱保全组长
    管理员（简称管）四十岁
    落纱女工甲、乙、丙
    时间：解放后半年光景，一天上午将近十一点，快到工人吃饭的时候。
    地点：石家庄某公营纱厂工务部门外工人休息处，细纱保全工人常在这里试装车架。
    景：舞台左面一门通工务部，正面偏左一大门通细纱间。工务部门外侧有一茶炉，台左有一工人吃饭用的矮长桌和几条长凳。台右斜置一正在装修的细纱车架，附近放有零件、油桶、油壶等。饭桌上有饭盒三四个。
    开幕：三不管，郑义，组长三个人在车架周围埋头工作，二混在一边擦零件，打盹。稍停，郑义抬头见混。
    郑　（指混）二混这小子又打盹啦！保险昨天晚上又没办好事儿！
    三　（不满的）不用说，八成儿又是看戏去啦！
    混　（被喊醒，不承认）你见我看戏去啦！？
    组　（正经的）二混！下礼拜就要开这部车，好些工友正等着上班哪！象你这么吊儿朗当的，什么时候才能装齐呀？咱们应当积极点儿！
    混　（把手里擦零件的纱布一扔低声的）积极值多少钱一斤哪！（坐在吃饭凳上，掏出烟卷，大腿压二腿，逍遥自在的点烟）他妈的，老子要实行实行民主，抽口烟再说！（吸起烟来）
    （幕后有女工拉长声喊：“唉！这个锭子烫的不行啦！加油来吧！”）
    组　（对混）二混！外头锭子没油啦，你去加一下吧！
    混　（爱理不理的）哼！……
    （幕后又喊：“快点加油来吧！这儿纺着空管儿哪！）
    组　（催促）快点去吧，二混！
    （二混懒散的拿起油壶走，油从壶嘴里滴下来）
    组　（嘱咐）二混！你不要漓漓啦啦的把油都倒在地上，这会儿锭子油挺缺的，你知道多少钱一斤哪！
    混　（眼一斜）我不知道！？十九万八千五一斤——我不知道？！
    郑　（惊奇混对行情的熟悉）你这小子倒挺内行啊！
    混　（后悔的掩饰）唉！我不过听物料栈说的，……（下）
    郑　（对组）组长，你看二混这小子，看戏、下饭馆有劲儿，一到干活儿就没有精神啦。他还说装好这部车让他媳妇儿上工哪，要都象他这样，哪辈子才能装齐哪！
    三　管他哪，反正不是你媳妇儿也不是我媳妇儿，上不上与咱没关系，说深了得罪人，合不着！
    组　（感叹）检棉部那个张大娘多好呵，偏修了这么个吊儿朗当的儿子。
    三　那还不是因为他是个独根苗，张大娘从小把他惯的！
    郑　你可别那么说不管，自打解放以后，张大娘对他比从前规矩大多啦，恐怕他不好好干！……张大娘觉悟的多快呀。
    组　那还不是因为他得了厂里的好处吗！
    三
    郑　（不同意的）你没得厂里的好处哇？这公营工厂就是咱自己的厂了，看！咱们谁不比从前生活好啦，你还说那没良心的话！
    （外有摇吃饭铃声）
    （张大娘提着茶壶饭盒上）
    娘　（对众）到点啦，该吃饭啦，你们怎么还干哪？（走向茶炉，倒水。）
    郑　唉：正念道张大娘哪，张大娘你就来啦！
    （娘打完水，把壶放桌上，坐下，开始吃饭。）
    娘　咳，来吧，早摇过铃啦，你们怎么还干那么急呀？
    组　晚吃会儿没关系，下礼拜还等着开这部车哪！
    三　张大娘，听说你们二混他媳妇儿也要上工呵！
    娘　是呵，俺二混媳妇儿前天到工会登记啦，工务部长答应她赶这部车装好了就让她上班。
    郑　（活泼的）对啦，看你张大娘的面上，我们也得干欢点啦！
    娘　（感谢的笑）那可好了！那可好了！……
    （二混拿油壶上）
    混　（不耐烦的对众）唉，该吃饭啦！（放下油壶，用纱布擦手，见别人不理，自语的）爱吃不吃，不管你们，先吃我的。（坐下就吃）
    娘　你看就你着急！
    组　（对众）好啦！好啦！咱们收工吧，吃了饭再干！
    （众收工，放下零件用纱布擦完手，到饭桌前）
    娘　你们都吃俺点吧！
    众　一样一样。（坐下吃饭）
    三　（脱下衬衣，放桌上，）天气真热……
    组　（亲切的）张大娘，我看你这几天气色好多啦。
    郑　是啊，张大娘，你病刚好怎么不多歇两天再上班哪？
    娘　嗯！工务部长也是这么说，那天我上班他也劝我多歇两天，我觉着歇的日子也不少啦，也吃下去啦，咱们这干惯了的实在坐不住；再说，光歇着也不乐意呀！
    三　张大娘，你闹这场病花钱不少吧？
    娘　那还能少了！—象我这连着病了五六个月，瘦的皮包骨头，眼瞅着走到地头上的人啦，幸亏共产党来救了我，现今公家来办工厂也和以前不一样了，厂里把我送到医院去，养了这一个来月。打针、吃药全是厂里拿钱，多少钱我也摸不清啦，少到没处去，也得个二三十万。
    组　（感叹的）这会儿工人有病，厂里花钱给治，要是国民党在的时候，谁管咱们哪！
    娘　（气愤）国民党！！要不是国民党把我开除了，我还得不了这场病哪！就因为我有病多歇了几个工，他们就不要我啦。他们要我死还盼之不得哪，还把我送医院？要是国民党那伙王八羔子们在的时候，我这条老命早就没了，不用说住医院，连医院门也进不了。
    混　（虽然落后，但国民党对他的压迫还是仇恨的）那会儿医院是给人家有钱的大老爷预备的，咱们穷工人配进医院？——有病死了，活该！
    郑　（半开玩笑的对混）是呀，张大娘这场大病好了，真是你们的万福哇！这会儿又给你娶上了个媳妇儿，张大娘一辈了就你这么个宝贝疙瘩，单看你们小两口怎样孝敬他老人家啦！
    娘　（感激的）就按这回二混娶媳妇说吧，我跟厂长一提，厂长连个顿儿也没打，马上开了个条就借了五十万；要在解放以前，不用说跟厂长借钱，连句话都够不上给他们说，咱们要走的离他们近了，他们还捻着鼻子嫌咱臭哪。
    三　要在以前咱吃不到嘴里饭，都没人管，还管娶媳妇儿？
    组　看解放以后工房娶了多少新媳妇啦，这会儿张大娘你也熬成婆婆啦！
    娘　苦熬了这么半辈子，这会儿给他娶上媳妇，也算了啦找这件心事啦。
    郑　（玩笑）二混，你小子还不好好干？这么个好媳妇给了你？真是一朵鲜花插到狗屎上啦！
    混　（掩饰自己的高兴，追打郑）俺有命——你小子想寻还摸不着哪！……
    组　咳！别闹啦，赶紧吃饭吧！吃了饭还干活儿哪！
    娘　（对混）真是，吃饭都不好好吃！
    三　二混，你小子一提老婆子就上劲啦！
    郑　咳，不闹啦，不闹啦，（跑了一圈热的喘起来）跑的真热，脱了再吃。
    （一脱衣服，摸着口袋里的活搬子）
    郑　（忽然想起）唉呀！光顾闹了，把正经事都耽误啦——早起我带来个活搬子，打算往厂里交也忘啦。组长，你看怎么办？
    组　你哪里来的活搬子呵？
    郑　（俏皮的）我偷的！
    众　（惊奇）偷的？！
    娘　（关心）怎么这会儿你还偷哇？
    郑　（嬉笑的）你们光听话头不听话尾——国民党在那会儿，我吃不饱，穿不上，我不偷他干吗呀！
    众　（松口气）闹半天你是那会儿偷的呀！
    郑　那天我偷了，想拿到西花园去卖，换三斤棒子面吃，谁知道第二天解放军就攻开石家庄啦，也没卖了，直撩到现在。
    混　（眼馋的）这会儿你怎么不卖了，现在比从先还值钱哪！
    郑　现在我一个月拿二百五十斤小米，厂里发了配买证，配买米、面、布匹、油、盐按八扣，吃不清喝不清，我还卖他干什么。再说厂里正装车，这都是咱们手用的东西，拿出来还不是咱们大家方便吗。
    娘　（称赞）你这个孩子真好啊！赶快交了去吧！
    组　对啦，快交到工务部去吧，这几天那么多交东西的，都得到表扬了，你要交上去了，保险一会儿就给你挂出牌子来啦！
    三　（单纯经济观点）对，交了吧，现在这么一个活搬子可值十几万哪！
    郑　好！你们先吃饭我现在就交去！（下）
    娘　（看着郑义背影赞叹）这会儿工人们可真是心眼儿开化了，这些个日子多少人交钢圈交零件儿啊！
    组　张大娘，你是不知道，以前郑义也不是这样人；国民党在的时候，他一进厂就是两个心眼，一个心眼光注意科长，一个心眼光结记着偷。科长一进厂，人家装好了的螺丝，他也拿搬子拧哒拧哒。科长前脚走，他后脚扔下搬子就溜，到摇纱偷个纱缕啦，到细纱拿几个穗子啦，我们保全部要是领个值钱的家具，三两天他就给你抄走啦，这个活搬子还不是那会儿偷的！
    娘　那会儿谁不沾补点啊，他们一天看的紧，反正谁也不能等着饿死。你们不记的，那时候夜班一过了十二点，那茅房里，这儿下六儿啦，那儿睡觉啦，挤的满满荡荡的连个下脚的地儿都没有。那象这会儿工人干的这么欢哪！到礼拜日工人还赶着加点，这会儿你们装机器八个钟头比早先十二个钟头干的活儿还多。你就拿郑义这个孩子说，跟以前简直是两个人啦！
    　　　　　　（未完待续）
