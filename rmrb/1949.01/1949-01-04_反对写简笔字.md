　　Oppose Writing Simplified Characters

　　Everywhere, on blackboards, wall posters, and in some documents, even elementary school textbooks, are filled with simplified characters, strange characters, and some newly created characters. These simplifications are neither rational nor aesthetically pleasing. Not only are the barely literate peasants and children unable to recognize them, but even those with a general education must carefully study them to understand. For example, the "victory" (胜利) character "@" is written as "肋" (rib), the "art" (美术) character "@" is written as "术" (skill). "Cadre" (干部) is written as "干阝", "@@" is written as "拥护" (support), "Ji" (冀, Hebei province) is written as "@", "Yu" (豫, Henan province) is written as "予". There are many, many such examples.

　　Now, our North China Liberated Area is vigorously carrying out production and construction, and all work must be standardized. Those simplified characters from our days of fighting the Japanese in guerrilla warfare should no longer be used; they should be changed to regular script in true form. Because the vast majority of Chinese peasants are illiterate, especially elementary school students who are just learning to read, such indiscriminate use and writing of simplified characters confuses everyone and effectively prevents the masses from reading. Therefore, I propose that in the future, whether on blackboards, wall posters, various documents, or especially elementary school textbooks, we must resolutely oppose writing simplified characters.

### 反对写简笔字

　　反对写简笔字
    各地黑板报上，墙壁标语上，以及一部分文件上，甚至小学课本上，到处都充满了简体字，怪体字，还有的随便造了些新字，简略的既不合理、写的又难看，别说粗通文字的农民与儿童不认识，就是一般有文化程度的，遇到这类的字，也要仔细考究才能认出。如：胜利的“＠”字，写成“肋”，美术的“＠”字写成“术”。“干部”写成“干阝”，“＠＠”写成“拥护”，“冀”写成“＠”，“豫”写成“予”。象这样的例子很多很多。
    现在咱们华北解放区，正在大力开展生产建设，一切工作都要走上正规。而我们过去在抗日打游击时代的那些简体字，现在也不要再用了，应改为正楷真体字。因为咱们中国广大农民群众，大都不认字，尤其是小学生，才学认字，这样到处乱用乱写简体字，就把大家闹得很糊涂，就是下决心不让群众看。所以我提议今后无论黑板报、墙壁标语、各种文件尤供小学课本，要坚决反对写简体字。（阜平一区赵庭培）
