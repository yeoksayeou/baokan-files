Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd: The Jinan-Xuzhou section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was connected south of Teng County between Guanqiao and Lincheng on December 21st of last year. On the afternoon of the 22nd, a trial train departed north from Xuzhou and arrived at Jinan Station on the 23rd. After the liberation of the Yanzhou-Taian section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in July, that section was quickly repaired and opened to traffic. After the liberation of Jinan in late September, the East China Liberated Area established the East China Railway General Bureau, which rushed to repair the railway south from Jinan. By the end of October, the entire Jinan-Yanzhou railway had been repaired, and work continued south from Yanzhou to Zou County. After the liberation of Xuzhou, both ends of the line were rushed to repair simultaneously. Thanks to the high level of labor enthusiasm of all employees of the Railway Bureau, the active repairs, and the enthusiastic assistance of the people on both sides of the line, it has now been completed half a month ahead of schedule. The Jinan-Xuzhou section is 720 li in length.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th: The Luoyang-Xuzhou section of the Longhai Railway, which is 420 kilometers long, has been repaired and opened to traffic in late December, after about two months of efforts by employees and people along the line. The repair work on this section was quite arduous. For the bridges alone, in the Zhengzhou-Heishiguan section, two large bridges and eighteen small bridges were repaired. The Xingyang Bridge, 70 kilometers east of Luoyang, is 15 meters long and 15 meters high, and was rushed to completion in ten days. The Heishiguan Bridge, which is 240 meters long with 48 arches, had 26 arches washed away by floods last autumn, and more than a thousand bridge piles were washed away. After continuous day and night repairs by 600 employees, it was finally completed victoriously on December 15th. Employees of the Kaifeng Locomotive Depot repaired 47 passenger and freight cars, as well as more than a thousand pieces of crane and various mechanical parts, in one day to meet the needs of traffic. A large number of sleepers required for road repairs were mainly supplied by areas near the railway line. The Luoyang Station received more than 5,000 sleepers from Yichuan, Mengjin and other counties in three days. Cadres from Huangzhuang District and Nianshang District of Song County personally led farmers to the mountains to cut trees before dawn, then saw them into sleepers and transported them to designated locations.

Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 4th: The Beining Railway from Luan County via Tangshan to Hangu section was restored to traffic on December 17th. This section is about 100 kilometers long. Now, the Beining Railway from Shenyang to Hangu, except for the Beidaihe to Luan County section, is fully open to traffic.

Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th: The railway employees of the Beining Railway's Fengtai to Yangcun section actively protected the railway, telecommunications equipment, and warehouses when the Kuomintang bandit troops fled. On the 14th of last month, the enemy who fled from Langfang Station forced the workers to flee with them and ordered the workers to destroy the pump mill motor, but all were rejected by the workers. The employees not only did not leave, but also secretly hid the four large mines that the enemy had prepared to blow up the pump, preventing the enemy from destroying it. They also guarded the various warehouses and machine rooms with sticks. The employees who guarded the pump were afraid that the fire would stop and freeze the water pipes, so they did not leave the fire for five or six days. After the establishment of the Fengtai-Yangcun Military Control Commission, the employees of each warehouse actively reported the number of enemy materials and machines. Employees of Luodai Station also reported the enemy's granary and ammunition depot. On the 20th of last month, employees at all stations had resumed work. More than a hundred employees at Langfang Station repaired the railway that had been cut off during the battle in one morning. A group of employees also drove to Fengtai to repair the locomotives. The Fengtai to Yangcun section of the railway was restored to traffic on the 25th of last month.

    【新华社郑州六日电】长达四百二十公里的陇海铁路洛阳至徐州段，在员工与沿线人民努力赶修下，历时约二个月，已于十二月下旬修复通车。该段之修复工程相当艰巨，仅桥梁一项，郑州至黑石关一段，即修复大桥两座，小桥十八座。距洛阳以东七十余公里之荥阳大桥，长十五公尺，高十五公尺，十天内即赶修完成。长二百四十公尺，四十八孔的黑石关大桥，去年秋季被水冲塌二十六孔，桥桩被冲走千余根。经六百余员工日夜赶修，终于十二月十五日胜利完工。开封机务段员工为适应通车需要，一日中修好客货车四十七辆及起重机和各种机械零件千余件。修路所需大量枕木，主要靠铁路沿线附近地区供应。洛阳车站三天中收到伊川、孟津等县运来的枕木有五千余根。嵩县黄庄区、碾上区的干部亲自带领农民，天不亮即上山砍树，然后锯成枕木，集中运往指定地点。
    【新华社冀东四日电】北宁铁路由滦县经唐山到汉沽段，已于十二月十七日恢复通车。该段长约百余公里。现北宁铁路由沈阳至汉沽间，除北戴河至滦县一段外，已全部通车。
    【新华社华北六日电】北宁路丰台至杨村段的铁路员工，在国民党匪军逃窜时，积极保护铁路、电务机器和仓库。上月十四日，从廊房车站逃走的敌人曾强迫工人一同逃走，并命令工人破坏唧筒磨电机，都为工人们拒绝。员工们不但不走，并把敌人准备炸唧筒的四个大地雷，偷偷地藏起来，使敌人无法破坏。他们更拿着棍子，守护各个仓库和机器房。看管唧筒的员工，怕火停了冻坏吸水管，五六天没离过火。丰（台）杨（村）段军管会成立后，各仓库员工都积极报告敌人的物资机器数目。落岱站员工并报告出敌人的粮库和弹药库。上月二十日，各站员工都已复工，廊房站百余员工一个早晨就把作战时拆断的铁路修好了。一部员工并开到丰台修理车头。丰台至杨村段铁路，于上月二十五日修复通车。
