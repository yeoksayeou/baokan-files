Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor:

I am an elementary school teacher from Guzhang Town, Fourth District, Lucheng County, Taihang Third Administrative Office. On the fourth of this month, I went to the Xiasheng Village school and heard from teacher Jin Gengcheng that there were seven or eight students from our area studying at Dongcui Village Elementary School in the Second District of Tunliu County, Taiyue District. The school has more than thirty students, all boarding students. The teacher, surnamed Guo (over forty years old, who served as an elementary school teacher in the old society), is still teaching the Four Books and Five Classics. I visited once and found that they were openly teaching the new textbooks, but secretly still teaching the Four Books and Five Classics. I think such education should be quickly inspected and corrected.

专栏：批评与建议

　　屯留二区东崔小学为何还教五经四书编辑同志：
    我是太行三专署潞城县第四区故漳镇的小学教员。本月四号我到下省村学校去，听到该村教员靳根成同志说，俺这里有七八名学生，都到太岳区屯留县第二区东崔村小学念书。该校学生有三十余名，都是起灶生，教员郭某（年四十余岁，他在旧社会里就担任过小学教员），现在还在教四书五经，我曾去参观一次，果然明里教新课本，暗中仍教四书五经。我想这样的教育，应赶快检查纠正。
