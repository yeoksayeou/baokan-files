Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Pingjin, 1st—The Northeast Field Army, which entered the Pass for combat, thoroughly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, earning widespread praise from the masses. Before the advance, each unit conducted thorough ideological education for the soldiers, emphasizing the observance of mass discipline as one of the central tasks of this long march, urging soldiers to consciously observe and mutually supervise. After entering the Pass, each unit continuously investigated the local customs of eastern Hebei to ensure the troops understood the people's circumstances. When requisitioning housing, all units cooperated with local government cadres, followed the system for collecting straw, used borrowing slips when borrowing items from the people, and followed local government-stipulated procedures when employing civilian labor. Some units even carried their sick soldiers to save manpower. A certain unit's medical team, residing in a Muslim household, respected Muslim customs by not using the landlord's tableware and keeping the pork they brought separate and uneaten. Before departure, they cleaned the ground thoroughly. The landlord said gratefully, "The People's Liberation Army is so good; they think of the people in everything they do." A certain unit's Sixth Company telephone squad, upon arriving at their campsite, disregarded their fatigue and helped a military family move a felled tree down the mountain and chop it into firewood. A certain unit's radio operator team carried water, manure, and chopped wood for their landlord. The grateful old woman cooked many sweet potatoes to give them, but the team politely declined all three times. Xiao Yonghua's company in a certain unit once marched ninety *li* in one night. Upon reaching their station, the soldiers put down their equipment and immediately went to carry water for the landlord. A certain unit's Third Battalion machine gun company carried water for the masses 229 times, swept courtyards 224 times, and conducted collective propaganda 22 times during their march. The division headquarters specially awarded the company a commendation and a banner reading "Not Taking a Needle or Thread From the People." A certain unit's cavalry company, in action, truly implemented the slogan "Horses Don't Nibble on Tree Bark," ensuring they didn't leave without cleaning up horse manure. This company also received a "Not Taking a Needle or Thread From the People" banner. During their march, each unit frequently held landlord symposiums or military-civilian celebration meetings to thank the people for their support and to solicit opinions on our army. They inquired about the hardships of the masses at all times and provided assistance whenever possible. For example, a certain unit collected over 400 items of clothing to help impoverished farmers. When a certain unit captured Yangliuqing, west of Tianjin, during their pursuit, they captured the fleeing puppet Jinghai County Magistrate and some of his staff from Tianjin. Our army handed the puppet county magistrate over to the democratic government for appropriate handling, while the remaining personnel were treated leniently, their personal belongings untouched. The carts they had seized from the people were returned to their original owners. Furthermore, when another PLA unit advanced into Tongbai Town, northeast of Langfang, the local old *baozhang* sent cigarettes and wine. The cadres of our company immediately refused. The *baozhang*, thinking it was not enough, slaughtered a pig and sent it over, but this was still refused. It was later discovered that the wine and meat sent were purchased by the *baozhang* through levies. The PLA immediately convened a meeting of the townspeople, explaining the PLA's discipline, and the people praised them unanimously. The PLA also issued a general order to all units that they were not allowed to accept gifts or invitations from the old regime. When buying firewood and vegetables, if it was done through personnel of the old regime, they had to supervise and openly hand the money over to the people in full, so as to avoid corruption and increase the burden on the people. Those comrades who violated discipline were given severe criticism. For example, a certain comrade in a certain unit treated the people rudely and unreasonably. In addition to criticizing him in person, the unit published it publicly in the newspaper. In a certain unit, a newly liberated soldier took a pear from a civilian, and the soldiers immediately stopped him.

　　东北入关大军纪律严明
  　沿途群众人人说好
  　战士们进出宣传处处为群众打算
    【新华社平津前线一日电】入关作战的东北野战军，彻底执行三大纪律八项注意，深得群众赞扬。各部在进军之前，曾对战士们进行深入的思想教育，提出遵守群众纪律为此次长途行军的中心任务之一。要战士们自觉遵守与互相监督。入关后各部不断调查冀东民情风俗，使部队了解群众情况。各部号房子时都与地方政权干部协同办理，按制度领草，同老百姓借东西则使用借物证，动用民工按当地政府规定的手续办事。有的单位甚至自己抬着病号走路，以节省民力。某部卫生队住在回民家里，为尊重回民习俗，不借用房东的饭具，带来的猪肉也另外放好不吃，出发前把地打扫得干干净净。房东感激地说：“解放军真好，处处为老百姓打算。”某部六中队电话班，到达宿营地后，不顾疲劳帮助军属把一棵砍倒的大树从山上搬下来，并给劈成木柴。某部电台摇机班，给房东挑水，挑粪，劈柴，感动得老大娘煮了很多地瓜送给他们，但送三次都被该班婉言谢绝。某部肖永华连，有一次一夜走了九十里，到达驻地后，战士们放下装备就去给房东挑水。某部三营机枪连，在行军期间，共给群众挑水二百二十九担，扫院子二百二十四次，集体宣传二十二次，师部特给该连记功一次，并给予“秋毫无犯”锦旗一面。某部骑兵连在行动中，真正实行了“马不啃树皮”的口号，作到不收拾马粪不走，该连亦荣获“秋毫无犯”锦标。各部在行军中，经常召开房东座谈会或军民联欢大会，感谢群众慰问，并征求对我军意见。行军中随时访问群众疾苦，并尽可能的给以帮助，如某部募集衣物四百多件，救济贫苦农民。某部攻占天津以西的杨柳青时，在追击途中，俘获天津逃跑之伪静海县长及职员一部，我军除将伪县长交民主政府按情处理外，其余人员均予宽大释放，私人财物丝毫未动，他们抢自民间的大车则发还原主。又解放军另部于进军廊房东北桐柏镇时，当地旧保长送烟送酒，我某连干部当即拒绝，该保长以为嫌少又杀猪一口送来，仍被拒绝收受。随后发现挑送来的酒肉都是该保长派款买的，解放军当即召集镇民开会，说明解放军的纪律，人民交口称赞。解放军并通令各部一律不得接受旧政权的礼物和请客；买柴买菜，如经过旧政权人员代买时，必须监督，公开将钱如数交给人民，以免从中贪污舞弊，加重人民负担。对个别违犯纪律的同志，则予以严厉批评。如某部一同志对老百姓态度横蛮无理，该部除当面给以批评外，并公开登在报上。某部一个刚过来的新解放战士，拿老百姓的梨吃，战士们马上加以制止。
