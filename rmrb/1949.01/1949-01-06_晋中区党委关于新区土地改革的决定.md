The Jinzhong District Party Committee's Decision on Land Reform in the New District
(November 15, 1948)

	(1) In order to conscript soldiers and collect grain, the Yan Faction implemented a "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system in most areas of Jinzhong. The method was to concentrate land from all classes, divide it into several "shares," each "share" including 30 to 60 mu of land with a balanced mix of irrigated, dry, flat, and sloped land. Young and middle-aged men from all walks of life aged 18 to 48 were organized into "Soldier-Farmer Integration" groups of three or six people. One person was drawn as a regular soldier, one as a reserve soldier, and the rest were organized as national soldiers, and then each person was allocated a "share" of land. The "share" of land for regular soldiers could be rented out or cultivated by their families. Other national soldiers were required to provide preferential grain and cotton to the regular soldiers or cultivate the land on their behalf without receiving preferential grain and cotton. Seventy percent of the grain harvested on the "share" of land was to be paid as rent and taxes. All young and middle-aged men had to accept the conditions of being a soldier and cultivating a "share" of land and were not allowed to refuse. From then on, all young and middle-aged men became serfs without freedom or rights. All women, the elderly, and children were not entitled to obtain a "share" of land. The implementation of this system resulted in 10 to 30 percent of households losing their land, and 75 percent of the population not being able to obtain land. Under the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system and the heavy burden of labor, the people were forced to flee, commit suicide, starve to death, or be killed by the Yan Faction in large numbers. Large amounts of land were abandoned, and some areas became uninhabited zones. It seriously damaged the already backward rural productive forces. The "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system is a more barbaric and reactionary new type of serf economy. This serf system must be completely abolished and replaced with a land system without feudal and semi-feudal exploitation.

	It must be pointed out: The view held by some comrades that the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system is more or less beneficial to peasants is wrong. This is because they did not see the serf nature of the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system, which strangled the peasants and rural productive forces. Similarly, it is also wrong to blindly put forward the slogan "Return the land to the original owner" in order to oppose the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system, because although the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system is extremely unfavorable to the peasants, it has broken the old land relations, which objectively brought some convenience for us to carry out equal distribution of land, and should be utilized.

	(2) In order to completely eliminate the serf-like "Soldier-Farmer Integration" tyranny and all feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land systems, it is decided that this winter and next spring, in the new district of Jinzhong, we will thoroughly implement land reform in accordance with the Central Land Law Outline and the instructions of the North China Central Bureau, and boldly mobilize the masses, so that the peasant masses in the newly liberated areas can also be liberated economically, politically, and culturally like the peasant masses in the old liberated areas.

	(3) The land reform movement in the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" areas should be carried out entirely in accordance with the spirit of the Central Land Law Outline, uniting more than 93 percent of rural households and more than 90 percent of the population, relying on poor peasants and farm laborers, uniting all middle peasants and all working people, to thoroughly eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land systems. In areas where land relations have been completely disrupted by the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system, only the principle of equal distribution according to population (including soldiers serving away from home and martyrs being given a share) needs to be implemented, which is the simplest and most practical method. In areas where the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" system has been implemented but is not very thorough, or where old land relations are still maintained in practice, the method of "not touching the middle peasants, moving both ends" should be implemented, confiscating the feudal property of landlords and requisitioning the feudal part of the property of old-style rich peasants for equal distribution. The so-called property here mainly refers to livestock, farm implements, clothing, grain, houses, and other property such as cash. As for silver dollars and silver ingots buried underground, while declaring them illegal, we should encourage people to voluntarily take them out, and the government will guarantee to leave a portion for the individual and persuade them to transfer to industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national livelihood, and the rest will be reasonably distributed to the peasants. If it is a large sum of cash, in addition to rationally distributing a portion to the peasants, it should be taken over by the state bank and not distributed. However, if they are unwilling to voluntarily take it out, we can only extend the time and conduct a thorough investigation, and it is strictly forbidden to excavate hidden wealth to prevent indiscriminate beatings and killings. As for new-style rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, only their surplus land is allowed to be taken under the principle of their own willingness, and other property is not allowed to be infringed upon in any way. The large houses and large buildings in the villages of traitors, local bullies, bureaucrats, war criminals, and large landlords should be confiscated by the people's governments above the county level and turned over to the public and not distributed. Roadbeds, large forests, farms, pastures, and large pieces of land other than those reserved for churches for their own use (for maintaining their own lives and growing vegetables, etc.) should be confiscated and turned over to the public and not distributed. Scenic spots, historical sites, books, and instruments should be protected and turned over to the public, and destruction is strictly prohibited.

	Landlords, old-style rich peasants, and other fugitives who have fled in fear of punishment will be allowed to return to their hometowns and be given land, except for those who have jobs outside and can continue to maintain their lives.

	In terms of struggle strategies, we must distinguish between landlords and old-style rich peasants, distinguish between large, medium, and small landlords, distinguish between local bullies and ordinary landlords, distinguish between rich peasants who started by labor and general rich peasants, and also distinguish between general rich peasants and rich peasants with the nature of local bullies. Well-to-do middle peasants are part of the middle peasants and should be strictly distinguished from rich peasants and not infringed upon. Generally, the method of struggle of sweeping them out of the house is not adopted, and the methods of hanging and tying are strictly prohibited. All major disputes that cannot be resolved by the peasant associations should be submitted to the people's court for trial and resolution, and reported to the higher-level people's government for approval and implementation.

	We must strictly distinguish between the industry and commerce of landlords and old-style rich peasants and their feudal land, and resolutely implement the central government's policy of protecting industry and commerce (including the industry and commerce of landlords and old-style rich peasants) and not infringing upon them. Encourage landlords and old-style rich peasants to develop industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national livelihood. The original industry and commerce of landlords and old-style rich peasants and the shops, houses, and property connected to industry and commerce shall not be confiscated.

	In areas where "Return the land to the original owner" has been announced, the method of drawing more to compensate for less, drawing fat to compensate for lean, and filling in and making up for the missing should be used to complete the equal distribution. In areas where the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" has not been implemented, the Land Law Outline should still be followed, but the principle of "not touching the middle peasants, moving both ends" should be observed.

	(4) Organize peasant associations with poor peasants and farm laborers as the backbone, uniting all middle peasants and all working people, and excluding landlords and rich peasants, as the legitimate organs for equal distribution of land. The leading organs of the peasant associations should guarantee that two-thirds to two-thirds of the poor peasants and farm laborers and no less than one-third of the middle peasants participate. At an appropriate time, temporary people's representative meetings should be established at the village, district, and county levels to supplement the shortcomings of the peasant associations. The old regime should be gradually transformed on the basis of land reform to establish a people's democratic regime.

	(5) Generally, the method of anti-traitor liquidation implemented after the Japanese surrender will not be adopted (this was necessary and correct at the time), but in the land reform movement, organized and led liquidation struggles should be carried out against traitors and local bullies who have committed heinous crimes and are hated by the broad masses. The method of struggle should focus on complaining and reasoning, supplemented by legal battles in the people's courts, and indiscriminate beatings, killings, or other disguised forms of corporal punishment are strictly prohibited. If the death penalty is imposed, it must be decided by the county people's court and approved by the North China People's Government before it can be executed.

	The so-called local bullies refer to those who often rely on their power and influence to seize land and property, seize other people's wives and daughters, harm the people, commit all kinds of evil, endanger one side, and have verified facts, and should not be given the label of local bully casually. The so-called traitors must also be those who have evidence of colluding with the enemy and harming the nation, and not those who have served as pseudo-officials or pseudo-soldiers for a few days. The central government's policy of "the ringleaders must be dealt with, those who were coerced will not be questioned, and those who have rendered meritorious service will be rewarded" should be implemented for traitors. However, the specific handling should also be decided by the county people's court and executed with the approval of the higher-level government.

	(6) In accordance with the Central Land Law Outline, abolish all feudal and semi-feudal usury. However, loans from the people's democratic government and people's banks, transactions of goods, friendly loans, and wage accounts of workers and shop assistants are not abolished.

	(7) During the land reform movement, party building work must be carried out. Correctly grasp the organizational line of party building, systematically expand the party's political influence on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses. In addition to generally absorbing individuals according to the party constitution, we can also adopt public mobilization, with the masses selecting candidates, but we must also go through the procedures of individual introduction and approval by the party committee according to the party constitution to absorb laboring masses' leaders, poor peasant and farm laborer activists, and revolutionary intellectuals into the party to prevent the phenomenon of forced conscription.

	During the land reform movement, people's representative meetings at the county, district, and village levels must be established step by step and in a planned manner, and the village regime must be thoroughly transformed, up to the further transformation of the district and county regimes.

	(8) All wheat fields planted this year under the slogan of "whoever plants it, harvests it" by the Party and the government must be guaranteed "whoever plants it, harvests it" (including wheat fields planted by landlords and old-style rich peasants), and promises must not be broken. After the land is distributed, peasants must be allowed to use the land they have been allocated only after the wheat harvest. Destruction of wheat fields is strictly prohibited.

	Land reform will not be carried out in the uninhabited areas created by the Yan Faction's "Soldier-Farmer Integration" (some people have now returned) this winter, only necessary adjustments will be made, and the focus will be on winter production in order to overcome the spring famine.

	In the entire land reform process, it must be closely combined with protecting production and developing production. The masses must be educated that the purpose of land reform is to develop production. Attention must be paid to the masses' production time, and meetings should not be held too much to waste the masses' production time. Encourage the masses to cherish the fruits of land reform, educate the masses to practice thrift and oppose waste, and use all the property obtained from land reform for continued development of production, and strictly prohibit destructive acts such as demolishing houses and cutting down trees.

　　晋中区党委关于新区土地改革的决定
    （一九四八年十一月十五日）
    （一）阎匪曾为了抽兵征粮，在晋中大部地区实行了“兵农合一”制度。其办法是将各阶层的土地集中起来，分为若干“份地”，每“份地”包括水旱平坡搭配均匀的土地三十亩到六十亩不等。将十八岁至四十八岁的各界青壮男子编为三人或六人的“兵农合一”小组，其中抽一人为常备兵，一人为预备兵，余皆编为国民兵，然后配给每人一份“份地”。常备兵的“份地”，可以出租，亦可由其家属自耕，另规定其他国民兵给常备兵以优待粮棉，或由其他国民兵代耕而不给优待粮棉。在“份地”上收获的粮食，需缴纳百分之七十的租税。所有青壮男子均必须接受当兵和领种“份地”的条件，不得拒绝。从此，全体青壮男子，变成没有自由与权利的农奴了。而全体妇女及老年人小孩子，则均无权取得“份地”。这一制度实行的结果，使占百分之十至三十的户口失掉了土地，百分之七十五的人口分不到土地。人民在“兵农合一”和繁重的劳役负担下，被迫大批相率逃亡、自杀、饿死，或被阎匪打死。土地大量荒芜，有的则变成无人区。它严重地破坏了原来就很落后的农村生产力。“兵农合一”制度是更加野蛮的反动的新式农奴经济。对于这种农奴制度，必须彻底废除，代之以没有封建和半封建性剥削的土地制度。
    必须指出：有些同志认为“兵农合一”制度对于农民或多或少是有利的观点是错误的。因为他们没有看到“兵农合一”绞杀了农民、绞杀了农村生产力的农奴制的本质。同样，为了反对“兵农合一”制度而盲目地提出“地归原主”的口号，也是错误的，因为“兵农合一”制度虽对农民极端不利，但它却已经打破了旧有的土地关系，客观上对我进行平分土地，带来了若干便利条件，应加以利用。
    （二）为了彻底消灭农奴式的“兵农合一”苛政及一切封建半封建性剥削的土地制度，决定于今冬明春在晋中新区依照我党中央土地法大纲及华北中央局的指示彻底实行土地改革，放手发动群众，使新解放区的农民群众也和老解放区的农民群众一样在经济上、政治上、文化上得到解放。
    （三）“兵农合一”地区的土地改革运动，应完全依据中央土地法大纲的精神，团结农村百分之九十三以上的户数，百分之九十以上的人口，依靠贫农雇农、团结全体中农及一切劳动分子，去彻底消灭封建半封建性剥削的土地制度。在土地关系已被“兵农合一”制度彻底打乱的地区，只实行按人口（包括出征战士在内，烈士亦分给一份）平均分配的原则即可，这是最简单易行的办法。在“兵农合一”制度虽已实行，但不十分彻底，或实际仍保持旧有土地关系的地区，则实行中农不动两头动的办法，没收地主的封建财产和征收旧式富农财产的封建部分实行平均分配。这里所谓财产，主要是指牲畜、农具、衣服、粮食、房屋及其他财产如现金等。其白洋、元宝等在地下埋藏者，一面宣布其为非法，一面则应鼓励其自动拿出，政府保证给其本人留下一部分，并劝其转入有益于国民生计的工商业，其余则归农民合理分配。如系大宗现金银则除合理分配给农民一部分外，应收归国家银行所有，不得分配。但如其不愿自动拿出，亦只能延长时间，切实调查，必须严禁挖掘底财，以防乱打乱杀。至于新式富农和富裕中农，则只允许在其本人自愿原则下，抽其多余的土地，其他财产则一概不许侵犯。汉奸、恶霸、官僚、战犯及大地主其在乡村的大房屋大建筑等，应由县以上之人民政府实行没收归公，不得分配。路基、大森林、农场、牧场、及留给教堂自用（维持其自己生活及种菜等用地）以外之大块土地等，没收归公，不得分配。名胜古迹、图书仪器一律保护归公，严禁破坏。
    逃亡地主、旧式富农及其他畏罪逃亡分子，除在外已有职业能继续维持生活者外，余均允许其还乡分地。
    在斗争策略上，必须将地主和旧式富农加以区别，将大、中、小地主加以区别，将恶霸与普通地主加以区别，将劳动起家的富农和一般富农加以区别，又要将一般富农和带有恶霸性的富农加以区别，富裕中农为中农的一部分，应与富农严格区开来，不得侵犯。一般不采取扫地出门的斗争方式，严禁吊打捆的办法。所有大的争议、农会不能解决者，一律提交人民法庭审判解决，并呈报上级人民政府批准执行之。
    必须把地主旧式富农的工商业与其封建土地严格区分，坚决执行中央保护工商业（包括地主旧式富农工商业在内）不得侵犯的政策。鼓励地主旧式富农向有益于国民生计的工商业发展。地主旧式富农的原有工商业及与工商业相连的店铺、住房、财产等不得没收。
    曾宣布“地归原主”的地区，应以抽多补少抽肥补瘦填平补齐的办法完成平均分配。在未实行“兵农合一”的地区，则仍应按照土地法大纲进行，但应遵守中农不动两头动的原则。
    （四）组织以贫雇农为骨干的、团结全体中农及一切劳动分子的、不包括地主富农在内的农民协会，为平分土地的合法机关。农民协会的领导机关，应保证有二分之一到三分之二的贫农雇农和不少于三分之一的中农参加。在适当时机，应建立村区县的临时的人民代表会议，以补农会之不足。并逐渐的在土地改革基础上改造旧政权，建立人民民主政权。
    （五）一般不采行日本投降以后所实行的反奸清算办法（这在当时是必须的、正确的），但在土地改革运动中，对罪大恶极为广大群众所痛恨的汉奸恶霸，则应领导群众去进行有组织的、有领导的清算斗争、斗争方式以诉苦、说理为主，辅之以人民法庭上的斗法，严禁乱打、乱杀或其他变相的肉刑。如处死刑，必须经县人民法庭判决、华北人民政府批准始得执行。
    所谓恶霸，是指经常依仗权势，霸占土地财产、他人妻女、伤害人民、作恶多端、危害一方、查有实据者，而不应随便给人戴恶霸的帽子。所谓汉奸，亦必须是通敌有据，为害民族国家者，而不是指当过几天伪职员伪军等。对汉奸应执行中央“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的方针。但具体处理，亦应由县人民法庭判决，经上级政府批准执行之。
    （六）依照中央土地法大纲，宣布废除一切封建半封建性的高利贷。但人民民主政府及人民银行贷款、买卖交易来往货帐、友谊借款、工人与店员之工资帐等均不废除。
    （七）在土地改革运动过程中，必须进行建党工作。正确掌握建党的组织路线，在充分发动群众的基础上，系统的扩大党的政治影响，除一般根据党章个别吸收外，还可以采用公开动员由群众推选对象，但又必须根据党章经过个别介绍党委批准的手续，吸收劳动群众领袖，贫雇农积极分子和革命知识分子入党，防止拉夫现象。
    必须在土地改革运动的过程中，有步骤地有计划地建立县区村人民代表会议，将村政权加以彻底改造，直至区县政权的进一步改造。
    （八）所有今年在党和政府“谁种谁收”的口号号召下，所种上的麦田，必须保证“谁种谁收”（包括地主和旧式富农所种的麦田在内），不得失信，土地分配后，必须待麦收后，农民始得使用所分得之土地。并严禁破坏麦田。
    为阎匪“兵农合一”所造成的无人区（现已有部分人回来），今冬不进行土地改革，只作必要的调剂，把中心放在进行冬季生产，以便渡过春荒。
    在整个土地改革过程中，必须与保护生产发展生产紧密的相结合。必须教育群众，土改的目的是为了发展生产。必须注意群众的生产时间，不要过多的开会以浪费群众的生产时间。鼓励群众爱惜土地改革的果实，教育群众厉行节约，反对浪费，把一切从土地改革中分得的财产均用之于继续发展生产上，严禁破坏行为，如拆房、砍树等。
