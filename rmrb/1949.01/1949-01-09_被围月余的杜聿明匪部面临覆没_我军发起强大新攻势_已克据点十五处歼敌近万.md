Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, Urgent Telegram, 7th: The People's Liberation Army on the Huaihai Front, at 3:00 PM on the 6th, launched a new powerful attack against the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps of the Du Yuming bandit group, which had been besieged for over a month. By 10:00 AM today, fifteen villages and strongholds had been captured, annihilating five complete enemy regiments, four complete battalions, and most of five other regiments, eliminating over nine thousand enemies, including over six thousand seven hundred captured alive. Currently, the headquarters of Li Mi's corps in Qinglongji and the headquarters of Qiu Qingquan's corps in Chenguanzhuang are exposed to the direct attack of the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 7th: The war criminal Du Yuming bandit group, besieged northeast of Yongcheng, is actively preparing to break through using large quantities of poison gas. In recent days, under the command of Wang Shuming, another war criminal and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Air Force, Kuomintang planes have been air-dropping large quantities of gas bombs to the bandit group. Furthermore, according to defectors from the bandit group, each member of the bandit group has been issued a gas mask and a towel, preparing for mass poison gas attacks to break through. It is reported that on December 27th of last month, the 96th Division of the 70th Army of the Du Yuming bandit army had already released poison gas against the People's Liberation Army in Guolou, poisoning seven PLA soldiers, all of whom were cured after emergency treatment. The gas bomb is named "Tear Gas Type 37 Chemical Projectile," is 18.8 centimeters long, and the projectile body is gray. It was manufactured by the Ordnance Factory of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense's Joint Logistics Headquarters. Experience has shown that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are not afraid of the enemy's poison gas, just as they are not afraid of the enemy's planes and tanks. The enemy's bestial behavior only increases the hatred of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army for the war criminals.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 7th: The Central Plains People's Liberation Army successively recovered the two county towns of Huoshan and Lu'an in western Anhui, in the Dabie Mountains area, on December 29th of last month and January 2nd of this month. Over sixty enemy troops guarding Lu'an were captured, and five light and heavy machine guns, over thirty rifles, one automobile, and over three hundred thousand catties of grain were seized. Thus far, the People's Liberation Army has controlled ten cities in the Dabie Mountains area, including Zhuwumiao, Yuexi, Jinjiazai (Lihuang), Xinji (Jingfu), Shangcheng, Gushi, Huang'an, Guangshan, Macheng, and Lu'an.

　　被围月余的杜聿明匪部面临覆没
    我军发起强大新攻势
    已克据点十五处歼敌近万
    【新华社淮海前线七日急电】淮海前线人民解放军，于六日下午三时，对被包围月余的杜聿明匪部邱清泉、李＠两兵团发起新的强大攻击，至今日上午十时，已攻克十五个村庄据点，歼灭敌五个整团、四个整营，及五个团的大部，歼敌九千余名，内生俘六千七百余人。现青龙集李＠兵团司令部及陈官庄邱清泉兵团司令部已暴露在解放军的直接攻击之下。
    【新华社淮海前线七日电】被包围在永城东北的战争罪犯杜聿明匪部正积极准备利用大量毒气突围。连日来，在另一战争罪犯国民党空军副总司令王叔铭的指挥之下，国民党飞机已向匪部空投大批毒气弹。另据匪部投降者供称，匪部已每人发防毒面具一个，毛巾一条，准备在大量放毒突围时使用。按杜聿明匪军七十军九十六师上月二十七日即已向郭楼的解放军放射毒气，致解放军战士七人中毒，但均经急救治愈。该弹名催泪性三七化学抛射弹，长十八点八公分，弹体灰色，系国民党国防部联勤总部兵工厂所制。经验表明：解放军的战士们并不害怕敌人的毒气，如同他们不害怕敌人的飞机、坦克一样。敌人的野兽行为只是使解放军的指挥员战斗员增加对于战争罪犯们的仇恨。
    【新华社中原七日电】中原解放军于上月二十九日及本月二日相继收复大别山区安徽西部的霍山、六安两座县城。俘六安守敌六十余人，缴获轻重机枪五挺，步枪三十余支，汽车一辆，粮食三十余万斤。至此，解放军在大别山地区已控制有朱屋庙、岳西、金家寨（立煌）、新集（经扶）、商城、固始、黄安、光山、麻城、六安等十座城市。
