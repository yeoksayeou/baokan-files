Among the personnel of American executive officials (big or small), investigators, representatives, and envoys sent to Marshall Plan-ized European countries, the names of senior officials of American trade unions occupy an even more prominent position. And the appearance of Hoffman and Harriman at European conferences surrounded by senior trade union personnel is almost commonplace and unremarkable. This unnatural intimate connection between those who are determined to stifle the American labor movement and those who occupy high positions in trade unions is a direct result of the AFL and CIO leaders' support for the Marshall Plan.

The Marshall Plan has become the basis for a direct combination of senior American trade union leaders and American monopoly capital in an institution whose purpose is to turn Western Europe into a colony of American monopoly capital. The root of the close relationship between union bureaucrats and American rulers lies in their shared hatred of all progressive forces in the labor movement, because progressive forces oppose turning trade unions from weapons for defending the interests of the working class into weapons of the workers' oppressors.

American monopoly capital is using agents in trade unions with the primary aim of destroying and weakening the labor movement in the United States and in Marshall Plan-ized countries and around the world. Splitting trade union organizations is one of the key points of their action plan in Europe. Because split trade union organizations cannot effectively resist the implementation of the "speed-up" system (that is, a system of intensifying labor under low wages and poor working conditions to create more profits for capitalists – translator), and this "speed-up" system is what American Compradors deliberately want to implement in Europe. Wall Street has given American trade union leaders an important task: to win leadership in the Western European labor movement and to destroy the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) – an organization that unites the working class in the struggle for the working class's primary interests, for peace, and against warmongers.

The Marshall Plan did not stipulate special funding for bribing trade union bureaucrats. But we have every reason to believe that bribery is taking place, and on a scale unprecedented. Monopoly capitalists are allocating a portion of the excess profits they obtain from Western Europe to support a group of trade union bureaucrats.

The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan laid the foundation for cooperation between senior trade union leaders, the State Department, and large corporations. The two American trade union federations were the first to actively participate in the Harriman Committee, and later in the work of the so-called Committee for the Marshall Plan. The names of Murray (note: CIO President), Green (note: AFL President), and Carey (CIO Financial Secretary) were widely used to create the impression that American workers supported the Marshall Plan.

Trade union representatives are often recruited into the countless missions sent from the United States to other countries. Some senior trade union personnel even abandoned their original positions and simply accepted high positions in the American executive agencies established in Marshall Plan-ized countries. The occupation headquarters in Germany and Japan both had labor "advisers" supplied by the AFL and CIO. Despite protests from many worker groups, the CIO's Golden served for a long time as a member of the "aid" mission to Greece.

After the establishment of Hoffman's Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), the appointment of senior trade union personnel as executive officials became particularly common. Monopoly capitalists believe that it is beneficial for them to hire people who are less obviously connected to Wall Street and who can speak to European workers in the guise of labor movement activists. On the other hand, this can also divert workers' attention from fighting for their own interests and focus their attention on European issues.

The ECA hired a large number of senior officials from the CIO and AFL – Golden, Martin, Livett, and Shesskin are just a few of the many. In addition, some lower-ranking labor aristocrats were appointed as "advisers" to the executive committees of Western European countries. Trade union personnel have also been appointed as labor attachés at American embassies in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Britain, Italy, and other countries. Hoffman frankly stated that he ordered his trade union agents to collect information on Western European trade union leaders and maintain regular contact with "non-communist" organizations.

The two American trade union federations consider their service to the State Department as part of their current and future activities. Therefore, they recently established an "Overseas Labor Service," whose staff has been specially trained. The Washington Post stated that the "Service" provided the government with personnel to engage in "practical tasks." In other words, the senior leaders of American trade unions have made their personnel serve imperialism, and these personnel are used as special representatives of the Marshall Plan and organizers of the split of the Western European and global labor movements.

The American "Overseas Labor Service" has begun operations in Western Europe, where it is solving some of Wall Street's most delicate tasks. In addition to other tasks, the personnel of the "Service" have been assigned the following jobs – forcing European workers to increase productivity to the highest limit, to be content with poverty and to accept the disastrous decline in living standards, and even to abandon their most basic economic demands. Hoffman and Harriman are fully aware of the indignation of workers in Britain, France, Italy, and other countries, which has been caused by the large-scale interference of American big capitalists in the internal affairs of these countries and their attempts to dictate their labor conditions. Therefore, their trade union agents have been ordered to eliminate all such legitimate indignation. They hope that if it is labeled with a trade union mark, European workers will be more likely to swallow the bitter fruit of American big capitalist control.

This explains why newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic have recently suddenly been greatly publicizing the significant contribution of trade unions to the Marshall Plan. It also explains the reason for the emergence of various "consultation" committees like mushrooms after a rain, whose sole purpose is to force Western European workers to pull chestnuts out of the fire for American monopoly capital.

The conspiracy to turn the World Federation of Trade Unions into a propaganda machine for the Marshall Plan has failed. Therefore, all kinds of lackeys serving Wall Street have concentrated their efforts on establishing a group that can accomplish that purpose. Therefore, they are also desperately attacking the World Federation of Trade Unions.

In March of this year (referring to 1948 – editor's note), a trade union conference of the sixteen Marshall Plan-ized countries was held in London at the initiative of the leaders of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC); the result was the establishment of the so-called "Trade Union Advisory Committee." The second step against the World Federation of Trade Unions was the second trade union conference of Marshall Plan-ized countries held in London at the end of July this year (1948).

Although the conference at Transport House (TUC headquarters) was conducted in accordance with all the norms of secret diplomacy, the information that leaked out and was published in newspapers made it clear the nature of the discussions and the decisions that were adopted. Trade union envoys from Washington attended the conference and made a series of categorical demands. They demanded even more intensified exploitation of European workers, accelerated offensives against democrats, and accelerated destructive activities against the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The leaders of the British TUC and the splitters among the leaders of trade unions in Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Italy have long since succumbed to money. For example, we know that the General Council of the British TUC, despite the firm opposition of more than 4.5 million workers, wholeheartedly supported the wage freeze policy, which transfers the entire burden of the crisis to the shoulders of the working class. The General Council of the British TUC also agreed to participate in the "Anglo-American Advisory Council," which was established by Cripps and Hoffman, and which stipulated that British industry would be placed under the control of American big capitalists.

These actions have completely swept away the prestige of the British trade union leaders among the masses of members. Even "The Times" of London stated on June 29 of this year (1948) that the prestige of British trade union leaders among the masses of members had declined.

Fear of this rift widening further and fear of trade union opinion explain why the senior leaders of the British TUC did not fully meet the demands of the American envoys. The American envoys attempted to establish a separate international trade union to counter the World Federation of Trade Unions. Therefore, the American envoys suggested transforming the Advisory Committee into a permanent international trade union organization, and collecting membership dues and other fees. They feared that such an open step to split the world labor movement would have serious consequences, and therefore dared not accept the American envoys' suggestion. What they adopted was a compromise decision – to establish a permanent secretariat for the conference. Brown, the AFL representative in Europe, was rather "frank" when he said that the secretariat was a step towards establishing a new international organization to counter the World Federation of Trade Unions. The representatives of the British TUC hastily expressed their opposition to Brown's opinion, saying that Brown's opinion only represented his own opinion. However, British newspaper commentary casts doubt on the sincerity of this denial. The press believes that after the British TUC Congress in September, further action will be taken at the request of agents of the U.S. State Department to cause the British TUC to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The center of activity for undermining the World Federation of Trade Unions is the senior leadership of the American AFL. Green and his assistants are acting for two purposes. Unable to dominate the World Federation of Trade Unions and unable to make it act according to the will of the U.S. State Department, they are persuading the senior leaders of the British TUC to sever relations with the World Federation of Trade Unions. At the same time, they are exerting pressure on the senior right-wing leaders of the CIO. In mid-June of this year (1948), the AFL leaders directly demanded that they immediately sever relations with the World Federation of Trade Unions as a condition for close cooperation between the two American trade union federations. The senior leaders of the CIO did not give due rebuttal to this provocative demand. On the contrary, the letters exchanged and the statements published after Green's declaration made it clear that Carey, Green, and Murray had no principled differences of opinion, only differences in tactical methods. Green and his ilk placed all their hopes on seizing the World Federation of Trade Unions, while Carey and his comrades hoped to destroy it from within. Moreover, both sides even used the hackneyed tactic of slander and innuendo, saying that the World Federation of Trade Unions was "communist-controlled."

Wall Street's old hands at international provocation lavishly praised the destructive tactics employed by the CIO. In June of this year (1948), the "Saturday Evening Post" published a long article praising Carey – the CIO's financial secretary and the CIO's representative to the World Federation of Trade Unions. The newspaper claimed that few people had contributed more to the work of destroying international communist plans than Carey.

However, masters and slaves are only dreaming of subjective good intentions. Carey is unable to destroy the solidarity of the trade unions. To date, his only achievement has been to expose himself as an agent of monopoly capital in the labor movement.

In the summer of this year (1948), the right-wing leaders of the CIO attempted to prevent the delegation of dockworkers and warehouse workers' unions from visiting Europe, but failed. Sending such a delegation to Europe shows how little the trade unions believe in the information provided by the "Overseas Labor Service." In their European tour report, the dockworkers' representatives ruthlessly criticized the Marshall Plan and the role played by American trade union bureaucrats in forcing European workers to accept this plan. On the other hand, they expressed their complete solidarity with the World Federation of Trade Unions, sharing weal and woe, and expressed deep respect for the creative efforts of workers in the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

However, what the dockworkers learned for the first time, all fair-minded people around the world already knew well. In all countries, the World Federation of Trade Unions is supported by the masses of the people. The situation is the same even in Britain. Regardless of the policy of the General Council of the British TUC, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, representing 800,000 members, declared at its annual meeting in June that the union could not tolerate attempts to split and weaken "the greatest progress ever made in trade union history."

The masses of British trade union members cannot fail to recognize that the conspiracy of Wall Street to undermine international unity directly violates the interests of the working class. Only monopoly capitalists are happy when European and world workers are divided.

The international trade unions are watching the treacherous actions of the dollar-paid employees of the trade unions on both sides of the Atlantic with open indignation. Trade union activists all over the world are convinced that the working class of democratic countries will victoriously maintain unity (which was produced in the severe test of the anti-fascist war), and will never be polite to those who oppose the World Federation of Trade Unions for the benefit of imperialism.

　　美国垄断资本反对世界工联运动
    薛定原著
    在派到马歇尔化欧洲各国的美国执行官员（大的或小的）、调查员、代表和特使的人员名单中，美国职工会高级官员的名字居于更加显要的地位了。而霍夫曼和哈立曼之出现于职工会高级人员环坐的欧洲会议上，几乎是家常便饭，司空见惯了。这种存在于矢志要窒息美国工运及盘据职工会高位的人们之间不太自然的亲密联系，是美国劳联与产联领导者支持马歇尔计划的直接结果。
    马歇尔计划已经变成美国工会高级领导者与美国垄断资本所建立起来的机构（其目的为变西欧为美国垄断资本的殖民地）的直接结合之基础。工会官僚和美国统治者间的亲密联系的根源，在于他们具有对职工运动中一切进步势力的共同仇恨，因为进步势力反对把职工会从保卫工人阶级利益的武器变成工人的压迫者的武器。
    美国垄断资本正在利用职工会中的代理人，其主要目的为摧毁和削弱美国的工运以及马歇尔化各国及全世界的工运。分裂职工组织是他们在欧洲行动计划的要点之一。因为分裂了的职工组织就不能有效地抵抗“赶快”（即在低微工资及恶劣工作条件下加强劳动强度，为资本家创造更多利润的制度——译者）制度的实施，而这种“赶快”制度是美国各康来仑蓄意要行诸欧洲的。华尔街已经给美国职工会领导者一个重要任务，就是争取西欧职工运动中的领导地位，及摧毁世界工联——它是把工人阶级团结在争取工人阶级的主要利益、争取和平及反对战争挑拨者的斗争中的组织。
    马歇尔计划并未规定贿赂工会官僚的特殊经费。但是我们有一切理由认为：贿赂已在进行，而且其规模之大，前所未有。垄断资本家从西欧所得超额利润中分出一部分来豢养一批工会官僚。
    杜鲁门主义和马歇尔计划奠下工会高级领导者、国务院和大公司间的合作基础。美国的两个工会联合会首先积极参加哈立曼委员会，后来又参加所谓争取马歇尔计划委员会的工作。莫莱（按：产联主席）、格林（按：劳联主席）和加莱（产联财务秘书）的名字被广泛利用来造成一种印象：美国工人支持马歇尔计划。
    工会代表常常被罗致到从美国派到其他国家的无数使团中。有些工会高级人员甚至放弃原职，索性受任在马歇尔化各国建立的美国执行机构中的高位。德国和日本占领军总部都有劳联和产联供给的劳工“顾问”。尽管好些工人团体抗议，而产联的哥尔登却做了很久的“援”希代表团团员。
    霍夫曼经合总署成立后，委任职工会高级人员任执行官员的事就特别多了。垄断资本家认为雇用一些与华尔街联系不太明显，并可以职工运动者姿态向欧洲工人说话的人，对他们是有利的。另一方面，这也是可以把工人对争取切身利益的注意力分散，而把注意力集中到欧洲问题上去。
    经合总署雇了一大批产联和劳联的高级官员——哥尔登、马丁、李威尔、薛西金不过是许多人中的一部分而已。另外，还有些地位较低的工人贵族则被任命为西欧各国执行委员会的“顾问”。工会人员也有被任命为美国驻比、捷、法、英、意等国大使馆劳工参赞的。霍夫曼十分坦白地说：他命令他的职工会代理人收集西欧职工会领袖的情报，并与“非共产党”组织保持经常联系。
    这两个美国工会联合会认为他们对国务院服务是它们目前和将来的活动的一部分。因此，它们最近建立了“海外劳工服务处”，处内工作人员曾经特殊训练。华盛顿邮报曾说：“服务处”给政府提供了从事“实际任务”的人员。换句话说，美国职工会的高级领导者使它的人员为帝国主义服务，这些人员被用作马歇尔计划的特别代表，分裂西欧和全世界工运的组织者。
    美国的“海外劳工服务处”已经开始在西欧活动，它正在那里解决华尔街某些最微妙的任务。除了别的任务以外，“服务处”的人员已被指定下列工作——强迫欧洲工人将生产效率提高到最高限席，安于贫困及安于生活水平的灾难性的降低，甚至放弃他们最基本的经济要求。霍夫曼和哈立曼充分知道英、法、意等国工人的义愤，这些义愤是美国大资本家大规模干涉这些国家的内政和企图规定他们的劳动条件引起来的。因此，他们的工会代理人已奉命消灭一切这种合理的义愤。他们希望：如果贴上工会标志，欧洲工人就会更易于吞下美国大资本家的统制的苦果。
    这就说明了大西洋两岸的报纸近来突然大事宣扬职工会对马歇尔计划有重大贡献的原因。而且也说明了各种“咨询”委员会如雨后春笋般出现的道理，这些委员会唯一的目的是强迫西欧工人为美国垄断资本火中取栗。
    把世界工联变成马歇尔计划的宣传机构的阴谋失败了，因此，为华尔街服务的各色各样的喽罗们，便集中力量来建立一个能够完成那一目的底团体。因此他们也拚命攻击世界工联。
    今年（指一九四八年——编者注下同）三月，在英国职工大会领导者的倡议下，曾在伦敦举行马歇尔化十六国的职工会会议；结果成立了所谓“职工会咨询委员会”。第二个反对世界工联的步骤，便是今年（一九四八年）七月底在伦敦举行的马歇尔化各国的第二次职工会会议。
    虽然在运输大厦（英国职工大会总部）的会议是依照秘密外交的一切规范进行的，但泄露出来而为报纸刊载的情报却使人们明白了讨论的性质和通过的决定。华盛顿的职工会特使们出席会议，并提出斩钉截铁的一大串要求。他们要求更加加紧对欧洲工人的剥削，加速反对民主分子的攻势和加速对世界工职的破坏活动。
    英国职工大会的首领们与荷比卢法意职工会的领导人中的分裂分子，久已向金元屈膝。例如，我们知道英国职工大会中央理事会不顾四百五十余万工人的坚决反对，全心全意支持冻结工资政策，而这个政策是把全部危机的负担转嫁到工人阶级肩上的。英国职工大会中央理事会又同意参加“英美顾问委员会”，这是克里浦斯和霍夫曼所建立的，该委员会并规定：英国工业将置于美国大资本家控制之下。
    这些行径使英国职工会领导者在会员大众间的威望扫地无遗。甚至“伦敦泰晤士报”今年（一九四八）六月二十九日也说：英国职工会领导者在会员大众间的威望低落了。
    害怕这种裂痕更加扩大和害怕职工会的意见，说明了英国职工大会高级领导人未完全满足美国特使的要求底原因。美国特使企图建立一个单独的国际职工会以对抗世界工职。因此，美国特使建议把咨询委员会改组成一个国际职工会永久组织，并收缴会费及其他费用。他们害怕：这样公开的分裂世界工运的步骤将产生严重后果，从而也就不敢接受美国特使的建议。他们所通过的是折衷性的决定——建立一个永久的会议秘书处。劳联驻欧代表布朗倒还“坦白”，他说：秘书处是走向建立一个对抗世界工联的新国际组织的步骤。英国职工大会的代表急忙表示反对布朗的意见，并说布朗的意见只是代表他自己的意见。然而英国报纸的评论使人们怀疑这一否认的真诚。报界认为：九月英国职工大会代表大会以后，将依照美国国务院代理人的要求，采取进一步的行动，使英国职工会退出世界工联。
    破坏世界工联的活动中心是美国劳联的高级领导者。格林和他的助手们正在为两个目的而活动。他们不能霸占世界工联，又不能使它按照美国国务院的意旨行动，他们便说服英国职工大会高级领导人与世界工联断绝关系。同时，并向产联右翼高级领导人施以压力。今年（一九四八年）六月中旬，劳联领导人直接向他们要求立即与世界工联断绝关系，作为美国这两个工会联合会密切合作的条件。产联高级领导人对这一挑拨性要求并未予以应有的反击。恰恰相反，格林宣言以后所交换的信件和发表的声明使人明白：加莱和格林及乌尔并无原则上的分歧意见，只有策略方法的不同主张。格林这批家伙把全部希望寄托在夺取世界工联上，而加莱及其同伙则希望从内部来摧毁它。而且，他们双方竟使用陈腐的诬蔑中伤办法，说什么世界工联是“共产党控制的”。
    华尔街进行国际挑拨罪行的老手对产联所运用的摧毁策略备致嘉奖，今年（一九四八）六月“星期六晚报”发表长文，赞扬加莱——他是产联的财政秘书，产联出席世界工联的代表。该报称：很少有人在摧毁国际共产主义计划的工作上，比加莱作了更多的贡献。
    然而，主人和奴才只是在作主观善良愿望的梦而已。加莱是不能够破坏职工会的团结的。迄今为止，他的唯一成就不过暴露他是垄断资本在职工运动中的代理人而已。
    今年（一九四八年）夏天产联右翼领袖企图阻止码头工人和推栈工人工会代表团赴欧观光，但未成功。派遣这样一个代表团赴欧，显示职工会对“海外劳工服务处”所供给的情况是何等的不相信。在他们的欧游报告中，码头工人代表们无情地斥责马歇尔计划和美国工会官僚在强使欧洲工人接受这个计划上所起的作用。另一方面，他们表示与世界工联的完全团结一致，休戚相关，而且对苏联及人民民主国家工人的创造性努力，表示深切敬意。
    可是，码头工人第一次知道的事情，全世界居心公正的人早已了如指掌。在一切国家中，世界工联都得到人民大众的拥护。就是在英国，情况也一样。不顾英国职工大会中央理事会的政策，代表八十万会员的机器工会联合会在六月间举行的年会上宣称：该会不能容忍分裂及削弱“职工会历史上从未有过的最伟大的进展”的企图。
    英国的职工会会员群众不能不认识：华尔街破坏国际团结一致的阴谋，其所追求的目的是直接违反工人阶级利益的。只有垄断资本家才高兴欧洲及世界工人陷于分裂。
    国际职工以公开的义愤心情注视着大西洋两岸的职工会美元雇员的诡谲行动。全世界职工运动者深信：民主各国的工人阶级将胜利地保持团结一致（这是在反法西斯战争的严重考验中产生出来的），而且对那些为了帝国主义利益而反对世界工联的人，决不客气。
