According to letters from readers in various places, everyone has attached importance to learning since seeing the North China Bureau's decision on the education of cadres in service. Various places have successively formulated learning plans, and there has been great progress in learning. At the same time, some difficulties have also been encountered. A district cadre wrote in a letter: "I have always listened to whatever the superiors said. Even if I didn't understand, I had to bite the bullet and do it. I didn't even know how I made mistakes. Learning is the same. The superiors said, 'Oppose disorganization and lack of discipline,' so I followed suit. But what is organization and discipline, why should there be organization and discipline, and what kind of mistake is disorganization and lack of discipline? I don't understand at all. After opposing it for a long time, I still can't figure it out." This opinion is a fairly common one. Most of our county and district cadres are scattered in the countryside, and they are very active, resolute, and responsible in completing various work tasks. However, they have no way to deal with learning alone. Is it because of laziness? Is it because of busy work? Is it because they don't understand the importance of learning? There may be some of these reasons, but according to many readers' letters, many people suffer from a lack of education. Although the instructions of the documents are good, they do not have the ability to understand and grasp them, so they have to parrot others. This kind of popular distress among cadres is now becoming more and more obvious. Reader Wang Yizhi said it well: "In the past, one person could implement a policy when they went to the village. Now, the Party's policies must be unified. In the past, when we mentioned cooperatives, it was nothing more than collecting shares and dividends. Now, we have to study what 'nature,' 'line,' and 'policy' are. If there is a slight error in the Party's policies, it will bring disaster to the country and the people. Therefore, without education, it is like a blind man riding a blind horse."

In order to cultivate and improve a large number of cadres and implement the North China Bureau's decision on the education of cadres in service, it is necessary to strengthen cadres' cultural learning in a planned way. This extremely important experience has been fully proven in many institutions' schools and tutorial classes. Reader Li Pinlian wrote in a letter: "In the past, whenever work was not going well, I would complain that the superiors were not concerned and did not help. Now that I have learned culture, I have realized my backwardness and ignorance, and I have become more interested in learning the Party's policies." This is indeed true. When the Soviet Union was implementing the New Economic Policy and carrying out comprehensive construction, Comrade Lenin loudly called out: "Raising the level of culture is one of our most urgent tasks." He also said: "What should we learn? First of all, learn to read and write." "If this basic task is not solved, then talking about the New Economic Policy is really ridiculous." Lenin regarded illiteracy as a major enemy. He said: "An illiterate person is standing outside of politics." But to this day, we still have a large number of illiterate cadres. What's more, according to Lenin's words: "It is not enough to simply eliminate illiteracy... We must greatly improve culture. We must enable a person to truly use his ability to read and write" to "integrate and absorb political experience," to lead and apply the Party's policies and government decrees, and to oppose bureaucracy and improve national construction work.

"A low level of culture is a stumbling block to progress" (of course, this is not the only reason). This has been keenly recognized by the majority of cadres, and it can also be clearly seen from the opinions of the broad masses of readers on the newspaper that everyone's demand for improving culture is so urgent. Many comrades have a mysterious view of learning culture and are intimidated by Chinese characters. In fact, as long as you study hard, it is not too difficult. The results of one month of cultural learning by the staff of this newspaper's office: 1. The advanced class has completed punctuation and preliminary grammar, and selected and explained four articles. The history of social development has been learned up to slave society. In terms of arithmetic, some have learned ratios and proportions, and some have learned decimals and three algorithms for four operations. It is hoped that the leading organs and learning committees in various places will attach importance to this issue, create various methods (such as cultural tutorial classes), and improve the culture of cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner. It is necessary to stipulate some strict systems, and at the same time, prevent impetuosity. All leaders should never be satisfied with only telling cadres about certain political tasks or political slogans, but should use great efforts to improve the cultural level of cadres in leading policy learning and theoretical learning. Otherwise, it will be as Comrade Lenin said: "It is impossible to truly realize our tasks." (Note: The Lenin's statements quoted in the article are taken from Lenin's Selected Works, Volume 16: "The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Department.")

　　进步的绊脚石
    据各地读者来信，大家自从看到华北局关于在职干部教育决定后，都重视了学习。各地先后都订了学习计划，学习有了很大进步。同时，也碰到了一些困难。一位区干部来信说：“从来是上级说啥我听啥，明明自己不懂，也只好硬着头皮去做，犯错误都不知道怎样犯的；学习也是一样，上级说：“反对无组织无纪律”，我就跟着反，可是什么叫做有组织有纪律，为什么要有组织有纪律，无组织无纪律到底是怎样一种错误，我是一点儿也不摸，反了半天，还是弄不出一个究竟。”这个意见是一个带有相当普遍性的意见。我们大多数县区干部分散在农村，完成各种工作任务都是非常积极、坚决、负责的，可是，惟独对学习这一门没有办法；是懒的原故吗？是工作忙的关系吗？是不懂得学习的重要吗？这可能都有一些，但据很多读者来信，很多人是苦于没有文化。文件指示虽好，自己没有理解和掌握的能力，只好人云亦云，在干部中这种流行的苦恼现在是表现得越发明显了，读者王益之说得很好：“过去一个人到村可以实行一个政策，现在，全党政策都要统一，过去一提合作社反正不过是集股分红，现在还要研究什么“性质”、“路线”、“方针”。对党的政策有了一字一句之误，便要祸国殃民。所以，没有文化，便好似盲人骑了瞎马。
    为了大量培养提高干部，贯彻华北局在职干部教育决定，必须有计划地加强干部文化学习，这一条极其重要的经验在许多机关办学校补习班中已经得到充分证明。读者李品莲来信说：“过去工作一不顺心就埋怨上级不关心不帮助，现在学了文化，才发现自己的落后与无知，进一步对学习党的政策发生了兴趣。”确是不假，苏联在实行新经济政策进行全面建设的时候，列宁同志曾大声疾呼：“提高文化水平，乃是我们最迫切任务之一”。他又说：“学些什么呢？首先是学读、写”。“如果这种基本任务没有解决，那末谈论新经济政策，实在是可笑的事情。”列宁把文盲看作一个主要敌人，他说：“一个不识字的人是站在政治以外的”，可是我们至今尚有着大批的文盲干部，何况按照列宁的说法：“单是消除文盲是不够的……我们须要把文化大大提高。要使一个人真正的利用他会读会写的能力”来“融合吸取政治经验”，来领导运用党的政策和政府法令，来反对官僚主义改进国家建设工作。
    “文化水平低是进步的绊脚石”，（当然这不是唯一的原因）这已为大多数干部所痛切认识，从广大读者对报纸意见中亦可以明显看出大家对提高文化的要求是何等之迫切。很多同志对学文化有神秘观点，被方块字给吓住了。其实只要认真地学，并不太困难，本报机关工作人员一个月学习文化的结果一、高级班已学完了标点符号及初步文法，选讲了四篇文章，社会发展史已学到奴隶社会，算术方面，有的学到比及比例，有的学到小数及四则应用题三种算法。希望各地领导机关学委会重视这一问题，创造各种方法（如文化补习班等），有计划有步骤地提高干部文化，要规定一些严格制度，同时还要防止急性病。一切领导者，绝不要只满足于告诉干部以某些政治任务或政治口号，而要在领导政策学习理论学习中，用极大力量来提高干部文化水平。否则，便会象列宁同志所说：“要真正实现我们的任务是不可能的。”（注：文内所摘的列宁语句系出自列宁选集第十六卷：“新经济政策与政治教育部底任务”一文。）
