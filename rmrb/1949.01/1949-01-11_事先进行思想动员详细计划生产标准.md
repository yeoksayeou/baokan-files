　　During the thirteen-day trial period, the factory had twenty-eight workers (accounting for 39% of the total production workers) who wasted eighty-five hours of work, accounting for approximately 1.5% of the total working hours. There were three reasons for this: (1) The factory's standard working hours for certain products were set too strictly, making it difficult for workers to meet the quota. (2) Workers neglected product quality, resulting in rework. (3) Some people had an incorrect understanding of bonus rewards, fearing that increasing the quota too much would lead to higher quota standards that would be detrimental to them, therefore they did not dare to boldly utilize the mechanical capacity. The factory has actively explained the above-mentioned backward thinking of a small number of workers. The factory leaders explained to the workers their position as masters in state-owned enterprises today, explaining that the benefits of their increased labor productivity belong not only to the state but also to themselves. They told the workers that the increase in workers' wages and the improvement of their lives can only have a solid foundation under the condition of continuous improvement in production efficiency.

　　During the trial period of bonus rewards, the factory gained the following experiences: (1) Before the trial, production quota work must be done well, that is, the average production time required for each product on a certain machine should be specified as a standard. The standard time for the quota should not be too high or too low, but based on the average time of the actual production efficiency of ordinary skilled workers. In the beginning, in order to take care of the majority of workers, it is better to be slightly wider than too strict. After a small number of workers exceed the quota, do not immediately change the standard working hours, at least until the technical level and production efficiency of most workers have improved a step, and through mass discussion, the new standard working hours are finally promulgated by the administration. Only in special circumstances, such as changes in machines, tools, or important work methods, and with the consent of the workers themselves, can the standard working hours be changed individually on a temporary basis. (2) It is necessary to rectify the labor organization, verify and allocate machines (handing over machines to fixed workers as much as possible), and formulate and implement reasonable production systems and procedures. (3) Prepare sufficient production materials and tools, and allocate them reasonably. Do not allow workers to encounter undue obstacles in their intensive production. (4) The factory's Communist Party organization and trade union should effectively cooperate with the administration to mobilize workers to ensure the smooth completion of the preparation work and the actual trial implementation of bonus rewards. On the administrative side, it is also necessary to value and rely on the assistance of the Party and the trade union, discuss and solve problems with each other, and not act arbitrarily. (5) The administration must have a special organization - the "Efficiency Section" - to do production quota work.

　　事先进行思想动员详细计划生产标准
    该厂在这十三天的试行期中，曾有二十八人（占总生产人数百分之三十九）浪费了八十五小时的工作时，占总工时约百分之一点五。其原因有三：（一）厂方对某些生产品的标准工时规定过严，使工人难以达到定额。（二）工人忽略了生产质量，以致返工重做。（三）有些人对超额奖励认识不正确，怕超额多了以后，定额标准提高对自己不利，因此不敢大胆发挥机械能力。对少数工人的上述落后想法，该厂已进行了积极的解释。该厂的领导人员向工人说明，今天工人在国家企业中的主人翁地位，说明他们提高劳动生产效率的结果，所得到的利益，不但是属于国家，也是属于自己的。他们告诉工人：工人工资的增加与生活的改善，只有在不断的生产效率提高的条件下，才能有稳固的基础。
    该厂在试行超额奖励期中：获得以下几点经验：（一）试行前，必须做好生产定额工作，即规定每一件生产品在一定机械上所平均必须的生产时间，作为标准。定额的标准时间不能太高或太低，以普通技术工人现在实际生产效率的平均时间作标准。在开始时为照顾多数工友宁可稍为宽些，不可过严。少数工友超额后，也不要马上改变标准工时，至少须等大部分工友的技术水平和生产效率都提高一步后，并通过群众讨论，最后由行政决定颁布新的标准工时。只有在特殊情况下，如因机器、工具或重要的工作方法改变时，并经工友本人同意下才可个别的临时改变标准工时。（二）要整顿劳动组织，核定和配备机器（把机器尽可能交与固定工人使用），制定并实行合理的生产制度和手续。（三）准备好充足的生产材料及工具，并合理分配。不使工人在加紧生产中受到不应有的阻碍。（四）工厂中共产党的组织和工会要有力地配合行政，动员工人保证超额奖励的准备工作及实际试行的顺利完成。在行政方面：也要重视和依靠党与工会的协助，互相商议解决问题，不能独断独行。（五）行政上须要有专门机构——“效率科”来做生产定额工作。
