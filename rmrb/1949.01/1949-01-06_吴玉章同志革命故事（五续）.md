Struggle Against the Kuomintang Reactionaries

　　After the meeting, Comrade Wu Yuzhang returned to Sichuan. Everyone originally wanted him to stay in Guangdong, but because the Kuomintang organization in Sichuan had only recently been established, he still needed to go back to take care of it. Arriving in Yichang, he fainted after getting off the rickshaw due to overwork. Someone gave him a cup of medicinal wine, and he revived. When he got to Chongqing, he went to the hospital to recuperate. At that time, the Kuomintang right-wing also established a provincial party headquarters in Chongqing and fought with the people from the Lotus Pond Party Headquarters every day. At this time, they would sing a double act. While in the hospital, Comrade Wu Yuzhang saw many injured people and asked what had happened. They were afraid of upsetting him and didn't tell him. Later, after regaining his health, he learned that they had been injured by the reactionaries.

　　In Guangzhou, the reactionaries also became rampant. On March 20th, the Zhongshan Warship Incident occurred. Because Chiang Kai-shek did not get the consent of Wang Jingwei, the then Chairman of the National Government, he arrested a large number of people on his own. Wang was so angry that he went abroad. On May 15th, Chiang convened the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, wanting the Kuomintang Central Committee to elect a chairman. As a result, he nominated himself. Thus, he took the Kuomintang's political and party power into his own hands. On June 5th, the government, which he controlled, appointed himself as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army. Thus, he also obtained all military power.

　　In early July, he launched the Northern Expedition, and Chiang went to the front lines. In mid-July, Comrade Wu Yuzhang went to Guangzhou via Shanghai. The Kuomintang people in Guangzhou were very angry about this dictator's autocracy. When He Xiangning saw Comrade Wu Yuzhang, she burst into tears. She said that the situation was so bad, what should be done? If things continued like this, the Kuomintang would collapse due to one person's autocracy. Comrade Wu Yuzhang joined other Kuomintang members and convened a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at the end of August, passing a number of important resolutions. These included restoring the Kuomintang's internal democratic system, opposing personal dictatorship, protecting the workers' and peasants' movement, and stipulating a 25% rent reduction.

　　At that time, during the Northern Expedition, the route led by Chiang Kai-shek attacked Nanchang. Although the weapons were good, progress was slow. The Fourth Army attacked Changsha, led by Ye Ting as the head of the teaching regiment. There were many Communist Party members in the army, political work was good, and the people were mobilized. They were invincible and known as the Iron Army. In September, they captured Hankou and Hanyang, and on October 10th, they took Wuchang. At that time, the Kuomintang Central Committee decided to move the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters to Wuhan, and they arrived on January 1, 1927, to begin working. In early November, some members of the Kuomintang Central Committee and the National Government had already arrived in Wuhan because there were many urgent party, government, and military affairs that needed to be handled. Therefore, a joint meeting was established, and Comrade Wu Yuzhang participated as a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee. The mass movement in Wuhan flourished. On January 3, 1927, British sailors injured a rickshaw puller. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated, and the government relied on the strength of the masses to negotiate firmly and take back the British concession in Hankou, shocking the world. The Wuhan government became the center of the revolution.

　　Chiang Kai-shek was late in capturing Nanchang. He felt that the revolutionary mass forces in Wuhan were strong, as frightening as they had been in Guangzhou, and he was unwilling to come to Wuhan. He wanted the government to move to Nanchang, but everyone disagreed. After the Hankou concession was taken back, world public opinion recognized the Wuhan government as the center of the revolution. Foreign newspapers at that time also said that this was an unprecedented victory in Chinese diplomacy in eighty years. Therefore, the idea of moving the capital to Nanchang became even more impossible, and he had no choice but to come to Wuhan to see the situation. When he arrived, hundreds of thousands of people held a meeting to welcome him. During his speech, someone in the meeting asked him why he didn't move to Wuhan and when he would move. He felt the formidable power of the revolutionary masses in Wuhan, and after returning to Nanchang, he became even more unwilling to come.

　　At this time, the dispute between Nanchang and Wuhan was very tense. Chiang Kai-shek convened a secret military meeting in Nanchang, attempting to threaten the Wuhan government with force. The Wuhan government (joint meeting) convened an enlarged meeting of the party, government, and military, passing resolutions to enhance authority, implement democracy, oppose dictatorship, and to convene the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee on March 7th to resolve all problems. A five-person action committee was elected to implement this resolution. Comrade Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yanda, Xu Qian, Sun Ke, and Gu Mengyu were elected as members.

　　The Second Session of the Third Plenary of the KMT Central Committee convened in Hankou on March 7, Chiang Kai-shek refused to attend. But the conference still completed victoriously: The party chairman system was abolished and replaced by a nine-member Standing Committee; the Military Commission was replaced by the commander-in-chief system, which held all military and administrative power; the National Government was reorganized, etc.

　　The third Shanghai uprising was victorious on March 21st. On the 24th, the Second and Sixth Armies of the National Revolutionary Army occupied Nanjing. At this time, the Yangtze River, both upstream and downstream, had been opened up, and the revolutionary momentum was extremely high.

　　This period of struggle with the Kuomintang reactionaries, on the one hand, shows Comrade Wu Yuzhang's courage and determination; on the other hand, it also tells us an interesting fact: that the very person who today desperately emphasizes that the revolutionary people must obey his military and political orders was himself neither obedient to military orders nor obedient to political orders, and not even obedient to his party orders, and was in fact building a family on this basis.

　　吴玉章同志革命故事（五续）
    何其芳
  　和国民党反动派斗争
    大会结束后，吴玉章同志即回四川。当时大家本要留他在广东，但他因四川国民党组织刚办起不久，仍要回去料理。到了宜昌，由于过于劳瘁，一下洋车后就晕倒了。有人拿一杯药酒来给他吃了，才又活了转来。到重庆，就入医院养病。当时国民党右派也在重庆成立了一个省党部，天天找莲花池党部的人打架。在这时，他们就会唱双包案。吴玉章同志在医院里，看见许多被打伤的人，问是什么，他们怕他受刺激，不讲。后来恢复健康后才知道是被反动派打伤了。
    在广州，反动派也猖獗起来了。三月二十日，发生了中山舰事件。因蒋介石不得当时国民政府主席汪精卫的同意，就自行逮捕大批人员，汪气愤出国。五月十五日，蒋就召集了一个国民党二中全会，要国民党中央推一主席，结果就推了他自己。于是，他就把国民党的政权、党权都拿到他一人手里去了。六月五日，又由他自己控制的政权特任他自己为国民革命军总司令。于是，又拿到了全部军权。
    七月初，出师北伐，蒋赴前线。七月中，吴玉章同志经上海到广州。广州的国民党人非常愤慨这个独裁者的专横。何香凝一见着吴玉章同志，就哭起来了。她说情形这样糟，怎么办？这样下去，一人专横，国民党就垮了。吴玉章同志就联合其他国民党人于八月底召开执监联席会议，通过了一些重要议案。如恢复国民党党内民主制，反对个人独裁，保护工农运动，规定二五减租等。
    当时北伐军队，蒋介石率领的一路向南昌进攻，军械虽好进展却很慢。而第四军是进攻长沙的一路，军中叶挺为教导团团长，全军共产党员很多，政治工作好，人民发动起来，所向无敌，号称铁军。九月间已攻下汉口汉阳，十月十日下武昌。当时国民党中央决议国民政府和中央党部迁移武汉，于一九二七年一月一日到达办公。十一月初国民党中委与国民政府委员，已有一部分到了武汉，因党政军有许多紧急事务须要处理。乃成立联席会议，吴玉章同志以国民党中委资格参加。武汉群众运动蓬勃展开，一九二七年一月三日英水兵击伤人力车夫，数十万群众示威，政府依靠群众力量，强硬交涉，收回汉口英租界，震动了全世界，武汉政府成了革命的中心。
    蒋介石迟迟攻下南昌后，感到武汉革命群众力量雄厚，如在广州时一样可怕，不愿来武汉。他要政府迁南昌，大家不赞成。汉口租界收回后，世界舆论都承认武汉政府是革命的中心，外国报纸上那时也说这是八十年来中国不曾有过的胜利外交。于是迁都南昌的想法就更不可能了，他也只有到武汉看一看情形。他到时，群众数十万人开会欢迎。他讲话时，会中就有人问他为什么不搬到武汉来，什么时候搬来。他感到了武汉革命群众的力量可畏，回南昌后就更不愿来了。
    这时南昌与武汉之争很僵持，蒋介石在南昌召集一秘密军事会议，企图以武力威胁武汉政府，武汉政府（联席会议）乃召集一个党政军扩大会议，通过提高当权，实行民主，反对独裁，定于三月七日召集国民党三中全会解决一切问题等决议，并推举五人成立一行动委员会，执行这一决议。吴玉章同志、邓演达、徐谦、孙科、顾孟馀当选为委员。
    三月七日国民党二届三中全会在汉口开会，蒋介石拒不出席。但这次会议还是胜利的完成了：废除国民党主席制为九个常务委员的会议制、以军事委员会代替总揽军政的总司令制、改组国民政府等等。
    三月二十一日上海第三次起义胜利。二十四日国民革命军第二、六军占领南京，这时长江上下游都打通了，革命声势极盛。
    这一段与国民党反动派斗争的历史，一方面显出了吴玉章同志的英勇坚决；另一方面也告诉我们这样一个有趣味的事实：原来今天拼命强调革命人民要服从他的军令政令的人，他自己却是既不服从军令，又不服从政令，甚至于不服从他的党令，而且是以此和家的。
