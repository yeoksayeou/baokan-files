[Taihang Dispatch] The entire staff and workers of the Shigjie State-owned Coal Mine in Lucheng, inspired by the continuous victories on the front lines, have launched a day and night campaign to increase production and support the front. After the military commentary by the person in charge of the CCP Central Committee about fundamentally overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary government in about a year was transmitted to the mine, the workers were extremely excited. Everyone in the mine, in every machine room, office, and dormitory, was talking about how Old Chiang was about to fall and how the worker brothers across the country were about to be liberated. Victory inspired everyone's enthusiasm for increasing production. Coal miner Chen Boze exceeded his planned coal digging quota by 13 inches in early November last year, and by 138 inches in mid-November. Zhao Fenpei exceeded the standard coal digging number by 11 inches in early November, 47 inches in mid-November, and 113 inches in late November. When the trade union proposed to produce 300 tons of coal per day in December, all employees responded enthusiastically and guaranteed to complete this huge task. Kiln head Zhang Yuanchang said, "The militiamen are participating in the war in the front, and the army is bleeding on the front line, all for the sake of defeating Chiang Kai-shek sooner. It doesn't matter if we put in more effort in the mine." Peng Xincheng and Dong Wang, who are veteran miners with more than ten years of experience, said, "If Chiang Kai-shek is not overthrown, it will be like a stone slab pressing on our bodies. If we lift this stone slab early, the workers of the whole country will be able to raise their heads one day earlier. Our increased production is for the purpose of liberating the worker brothers and the people of the whole country earlier." The trade union's call immediately turned into practical action by all employees: the output in early December was 3,004 tons. Recently, after hearing the news on the radio that our army had surrounded major cities such as Beiping and recovered victories in Tangshan and Tongzhou, the workers' enthusiasm for increasing production was even higher. They worked day and night with extreme intensity. On December 16th of last year, the output reached more than 360 tons, and on the 19th, the output increased to 470 tons, exceeding the original plan by more than one-half, creating the mine's highest production record.

　　胜利鼓舞着石圪节矿工
  　奋发增产支援前线
  　产量超过计划半倍
    【太行电】潞城石圪节公营煤矿全体职工在前线不断胜利的鼓舞下，开展了日以继夜的增产支前运动。自中共中央负责人关于一年左右根本上打倒国民党反动政府的军事评论传到矿厂后，工人们兴奋异常，矿井上下、每个机器房、办公室、宿舍里都谈论着老蒋快完蛋，全国工人兄弟就要解放。胜利鼓舞着大家的增产热情，掘煤工陈伯则去年十一月上旬掘煤超过计划十三英寸，中旬就超过一百三十八英寸。赵奋培十一月上旬掘煤超过标准数十一英寸，中旬即到四十七英寸，下旬就到了一百一十三英寸。当职工会提出在十二月份内要日产煤炭三百吨的号召时，全体职工纷纷响应，保证完成这一巨大任务。窑头张元昌说：“民兵在前方参战，军队在火线流血，都为了早些打垮蒋介石，咱们在矿上多出些力不算什么。”彭新城、董旺是十多年的老矿工，他们说：“打不垮蒋介石，就象身上压着块石板，早掀起这块石板，全国工人就能早一天抬头，咱们增加生产，就是为了提早解放全国工人兄弟和全国老百姓。”工会的号召立即变成了全体职工的实际行动：十二月上旬产量是三千零四吨；最近从广播电台上听到我军包围了北平等大城市，收复唐山、通州的胜利消息后，工人们的增产热情更加高涨，都是日以继夜极度紧张地工作着。去年十二月十六日产量即达三百六十余吨，而十九日这天产量又增至四百七十吨，超过了原定计划的二分之一以上，创造了该矿产量的最高纪录。
