Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 5th: The Luoyang Public Security Bureau uncovered a Kuomintang military conspiracy case in early November of last year. The chief culprits in the case, He Renfu, Wu Maozhai, and Wang Zhenqing, have been sentenced to death with the approval of higher authorities by the Luoyang Public Security Bureau. This military conspiracy was instigated by Kuomintang war criminal Hu Zongnan. Bandit He Renfu was secretly dispatched by Hu as the commander of the 35th Brigade of the Jinan Guerrilla Column. Bandit Wang Zhenqing was the deputy commander. After the two bandits, He and Wang, secretly came to Luoyang City in June of last year, they immediately contacted some of the township chiefs from the Kuomintang rule era, attempting to use Liu Lin Town in Yiyang County as a base to organize bandits and disrupt the order in the rear of the liberated areas. Bandit Wu Maozhai was the commander of the 4th Column of the Henan Guerrilla Force under the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense, attempting to use Bahai Village in Funiu Mountain as a base to gather local bandits and reactionary secret society armed forces such as the Bagong Dao and Red Spear Society. Bandit Wu sneaked into Luoyang City in August of last year under orders, contacted the two bandits He Renfu and Wang Zhenqing, and organized the so-called "Garrison Headquarters," vainly attempting to coordinate with the Kuomintang army's intrusion into the Liberated Area of western Henan. After the Luoyang Public Security Bureau learned of the aforementioned conspiracy activities of these bandits, they arrested all three bandits, He, Wang, and Wu, in early November of last year. Certificates of appointment and other items were found among the burned documents. Because the evidence was conclusive, the criminals could not deny it during interrogation and confessed to their crimes one by one. According to reports, bandit He Renfu was from Liu Lin Town, Yiyang. During the Japanese occupation of Luoyang, he served as an investigator and transport team leader for the Japanese-controlled Yuxi Salt Affairs Office. After the Japanese surrender, he transformed into the captain of the Second Detachment of the Eighth Brigade of the Guerrilla Column north of the Luo River and the special service captain of the Luoyang Pacification Zone. The bandit committed numerous crimes, having successively murdered Hu Nuoyu, Pan Haidong, Xie Wensan, and Li Shen in Yiyang's Liu Lin Town and Yanshi. After Xie Wensan was murdered, the bandit seized his property and took his wife. Bandit Wu Maozhai was from Cai Village, Yiyang, and had served as the special service captain of the 15th Division of the Kuomintang bandit army and the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the Henan Security Forces. Wang Zhenqing was a notorious local bandit in southern Luoyang, committing robbery, arson, and murder, and doing all kinds of evil.
