　　Adhering to the Principle of Non-Interference in Internal Affairs
  　The Soviet Union Rejects Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Request for Mediation
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th】TASS Moscow, 17th: On January 8th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a memorandum to the Soviet Embassy in China. In it, the Chinese government requested the Soviet government to act as mediator in peaceful negotiations between the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese government informed the Soviet Ambassador that the same suggestion had been made to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. On January 17th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky met with Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, and conveyed the Soviet government's reply. The reply pointed out that the Soviet government consistently adheres to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and believes that undertaking the proposed mediation in the aforementioned memorandum is inappropriate. The Soviet government's reply stated: The restoration of China's unity as a democratic and peace-loving country is a matter for the Chinese people themselves, and such unity can best be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties concerned, relying on China's internal forces, without the need for foreign interference.

　　恪守不干涉他国内政原则
  　苏联拒绝蒋匪调解乞求
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：一月八日，中国外交部向苏联驻华大使馆递交备忘录一件。其中中国政府要求苏联政府出任中国政府与中国共产党之间和平谈判的调解人。中国政府通知苏联大使称：中国政府已向美、英、法政府提出同样建议。一月十七日，苏联外交部副部长维辛斯基接见中国驻苏大使傅秉常转达苏联政府的复函，该复函指出：苏联政府始终不渝地恪守不干涉他国内政的原则，并认为承担上述备忘录中所提的居间调解是不适宜的。苏联政府的复函中指出：恢复中国之作为民主的与爱好和平的国家的统一，是中国人民自己的事情，要得到这种统一，最好可经有关方面直接谈判，依靠中国的内部力量，无需外国的干涉。
