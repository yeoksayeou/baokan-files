Yangquan Municipal Public Mines
  Increasing Employee Welfare
  Implementing the Spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference
    Under the Rule of Japanese and Yan Bandits, Employee Welfare was Non-Existent
  　Improved Mining Methods Make Workers Bolder to Go Down the Mine
    Established Schools for Children, Increased Cultural Entertainment
    [This newspaper dispatch] Yangquan Municipal Public Mines have initially implemented the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference and have achieved many successes in the implementation of labor insurance and worker welfare.

    Before liberation, under the rule of Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, employee welfare and labor insurance were fundamentally non-existent. The Yangquan mines contain a coal seam eighteen feet high. In pursuit of profit, the Japanese and Yan bandits adopted the "longwall" mining method, which opened up to ten or twenty meters on both sides. The roadways were too wide and lacked safety equipment, causing the roof to lose its supporting capacity. Every time the tunnel collapsed, three to five or six to seven workers would be crushed to death. The workers said, "Four stones sandwiching a piece of meat, who knows when we will be crushed to death." In particular, the ventilation was poor, and gas explosions often occurred, burning many workers to death. In August of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China (1944), one explosion in the No. 2 mine killed seventy-six workers. During the Japanese occupation, the mine police and factory police, and Yan's "National Protection Corps" often beat and scolded workers. A single disagreement could result in a beating. In winter, workers' clothes were thin, and the workshops were cold. The factory was full of coal but forbade workers from burning it, only allowing them to burn coal cinder. Sometimes workers would secretly take a few pieces, and if discovered by the factory, they would be beaten or forced to kneel with large pieces of coal on their heads. The factory police of the Yangquan Iron Smelting Plant once beat to death Shi Yushan, a worker in the ceramics department. Foremen beating workers and masters beating apprentices was completely legal.

    After Yangquan was liberated in May of the year before last (1947), the No. 4 Mine, Pingji, Pingshun, Yuhua and other mines successively resumed work by February of last year (1948), and the Sanhe Factory also began iron smelting and pottery firing in April. In terms of labor insurance: all mines have generally improved mining methods, changing from the "longwall method" to the pillar method. Specifications have been made, with certain limits on height and width, gradually transforming into long-term roadways. At dangerous places, retaining walls are built or wooden pillars are used for support, initially ensuring the safety of workers' mining. Particular attention has been paid to ventilation: unnecessary tunnels have been fitted with windbreak doors, so that the wind force is not dispersed but is more concentrated and unobstructed. It is also strictly forbidden to damage the ventilation ducts when mining. Taking the No. 4 Mine as an example, the strengthening of safety equipment in the mine has greatly reduced the number of deaths in the mine. In the past nine months, only three workers have died in the mine.

    Before April of last year, there were no fixed methods for employee welfare work in the mines and factories. Problems were solved on a case-by-case basis. In April, in accordance with the spirit of the North China Employees' Conference, one percent of the total monthly wage expenditure of each mine and factory was collected as cultural and educational funds, and two and a half percent as insurance funds. The No. 4 Mine, Pingji Mine, and Sanhe Factory have each established clinics. All matters related to worker injury, death compensation, etc., are handled by the trade unions of each mine. Because the amount of compensation was not explicitly stipulated, the implementation was still very uneven.

    At the end of September, a municipal-level employee welfare committee was established, which discussed employee compensation and relief measures, and decided to handle employee cultural and educational undertakings and employee children's schools. In order to solve the problem of supplying employees with daily necessities in the future, it was decided to strengthen employee cooperatives, organize worker family production, handle employee savings, and improve medical and health care. The Baoxingheng Coal and Iron General Store also decided to be responsible for ensuring that employee welfare funds are not affected by price fluctuations. In accordance with the resolutions of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, it will uniformly raise 1.5 percent of the total monthly wage expenditure of each mine and factory for cultural and educational funds, and 2.5 percent for insurance funds. The city extracted 300 million Border Region currency from the welfare fund to establish the Yangquan Municipal Public Mines Employee Cooperative, and organized a textile factory with more than 20 worker families. The originally mimeographed employee newspaper published by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions was changed to letterpress printing (published every seven days), and employees can read the newspaper for free. A workers' club has been established in the city, and many railway workers and iron factory workers go to play ball and play chess. An entertainment party is held every Saturday night, and tickets are issued for workers to watch movies. The Sanhe Factory took the lead in establishing a school for employee children, and seventy-three workers' children now have the opportunity to attend school. The No. 4 Mine's employee cooperative is also actively solving difficulties for employees, saving employees the 20-mile round trip to Yangquan City to buy things. The Sanhe Factory Employee Cooperative does not raise prices for three days after payday. Each mine and factory evaluates rice prices every half month (wages are paid according to rice prices), ensuring that employees' rice wages are not eaten away by rising prices, which has been well received by employees. In terms of labor insurance: Sanhe Factory has not heard of any improvements. After the Pingshun Mine was merged with the No. 4 Mine, the No. 4 Mine was able to better improve the ventilation ducts, reducing the risk of gas combustion to a minimum. In order to prevent pushing workers from encountering danger, a 700-meter-long steel wire rope was installed on the large wooden bridge connecting the No. 4 Mine and the No. 2 Mine to transport coal trucks. More electric lights have also been added to the transport roads. In addition, each mine and factory has repaired some of the workers' dormitories, and electric lights have been installed in some workers' rooms in the No. 4 Mine.

    In terms of relief and compensation: each mine and factory has also initially implemented the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference. In November, an enemy plane shot and killed Liu Huanyi, a worker at the Sanhe Iron Factory, and immediately paid a coffin, 200 catties of rice, and 2 million Border Region currency in compensation. In October, a coal truck at the No. 4 Mine crashed and a worker was crushed to death in the mine. In addition to issuing a coffin, 400 catties of rice were issued as compensation. Two workers at the power plant died of illness, and coffins were issued as usual. One was issued 300 catties of rice, and the other was issued 400 catties of rice. The workmates also provided more than 100 catties of millet to each other. Electrician Wang Zhihe became blind due to illness. After paying him 460 catties of millet as a living allowance from the insurance fund, he was sent back to his place of origin to be resettled by the local government. In August, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed the factory workers' dormitories, and the workers' clothes and quilts were destroyed. The factory subsidized the workers for about one-third of the losses. In addition, workers in each mine and factory who were injured on duty were also paid their wages.

    Although the Yangquan public mines have achieved the above-mentioned results, there are still some areas that need to be improved. For example, some mines and factories do not provide enough care for workers during their illness. Wang Qiulan, a sick worker in the Sanhe Factory, only received one month's salary after being ill. Because he had many family members, his life was extremely difficult. His workmates subsidized him with 1.6 million Border Region currency, while the trade union only paid him 200,000 Border Region currency in relief funds. Worker Hou Degong of the factory owed more than 100 catties of millet for food while he was hospitalized due to illness, and the branch trade union only paid him 60 catties of millet. Three workers at the No. 4 Mine were sick for more than a month, and each was only given 40 catties of millet in relief. The employee welfare work of the branch trade unions in each mine and factory is still circling around "handling the aftermath" (that is, waiting for something to happen before dealing with it). In the future, it is urgent to widely carry out welfare education among the workers, continuously summarize the causes of worker injuries and illnesses, educate the workers, and rapidly shift employee welfare work to the active side.

　　阳泉市公营矿厂
  　增进职工生活福利
  　贯彻了华北工商业会议精神
    在日阎匪统治下谈不上工人福利
  　改善了采煤方法工人下矿大胆了
    设立子弟学校增加文化娱乐
    【本报讯】阳泉市公营矿厂初步贯彻了华北工商会议的精神，在执行劳动保险与工人福利工作上已获很多成绩。
    解放前，该矿在日寇与阎匪统治下，工人福利与劳动保险事业是根本谈不到的。阳泉矿山蕴藏着一丈八尺高的煤层，日、阎匪为了追求利润，采用了“长壁法”的采炭法，即十米二十米的向两旁开阔。行道过宽，又无安全设备，坑顶失却支撑能力，每次坑道塌陷，都要砸死三五个到六七个工人。工人们说：“四块石头夹一块肉，不知那会被砸死。”特别是通风不好，时常发生瓦斯燃烧，不少工人被烧死。民国三十三年八月间，二矿一次烧死七十六个工人。日寇时期的矿警、厂警，阎匪的“保国队”，打骂工人是常事，一句不投机，就是一棒子。冬天工人衣服单薄，工房又冷，厂里堆满大炭不叫工人烧，只准烧煤碴，工人有时偷拿几块，被厂方发觉，不是挨揍，就是头顶大炭罚跪。阳泉炼铁厂厂警曾打死陶磁部工人石玉山。工头打工人，师傅打徒弟，完全合法。
    阳泉于前年五月解放后，到去年二月，四矿、平济、平顺、裕华等矿相继复工，三合厂亦于四月间开始炼铁烧磁，在劳动保险方面：各矿普遍改善了采炭法，即改“长壁法”为穿柱法。作出规格，宽高有一定限度，逐渐改造为长期打算的行道。危险处发砌圈墙或作木柱支棚，初步保证了工人采炭的安全。特别是注意了通风：不必要的坑洞设置了堵风门，使风力不分散而更加集中通畅。并严禁采炭时伤损风道。以四矿为例，由于加强了矿内安全设备，使坑内死亡大大减少，九个月来坑内只死三个工人。
    去年四月以前，各矿厂工人福利工作无一定办法，发生问题时酌情解决。四月间按华北职工会议的精神，从各矿厂征收每月工资开支总额的百分之一为文教费，百分之二点五为保险金。四矿、平济矿、三合厂各设了诊疗所，凡有关工人伤亡抚恤事宜，由各该矿职工会执行。由于抚恤数目无一定明文规定，执行起来仍很不划一。
    九月底，市一级成立了职工福利委员会，讨论了职工抚恤救济办法，并决定办理职工文化教育事业及职工子弟学校。为解决今后职工生活必需品的供应问题，决定加强职工合作社，组织工属生产，办理职工储蓄，改善医药卫生等，宝兴亨煤铁总店也决定负责保证职工福利金不受物价波动的影响，依照华北工商会议的决议，统一向各矿厂筹措每月工资开支总额百分之一点五的文教费，百分之二点五的保险金。该市从福利金中抽出三亿边钞，成立了阳泉市公营矿厂职工合作社，并组织了二十多个工人家属的纺织厂。市总工会原出版之油印职工报，改为铅印（每七天出一次），职工看报不花钱。在市内设立了工人俱乐部，不少铁路工人、铁厂工人去打球下棋，每礼拜六晚上开一次娱乐晚会，并发票请工人看电影。三合厂首先成立了职工子弟学校，现有七十三个工人子女得到就学机会，四矿职工合作社也积极给职工解决困难，省得职工来回二十里地到阳泉市买东西。三合厂职工合作社，在发薪后三天不涨价，各矿厂每半个月评一次米价（按米价发工资），保证了职工米薪不吃物价上涨的亏，得到职工们的好评，在劳动保险方面：三合厂尚未闻有什么改进。平顺矿合并给四矿后，使四矿更好地改善了风道，把瓦斯燃烧的危险性降低到最低程度。为使推车工人不出危险，在四矿通二矿的大木桥上设置了长达七百米的钢丝循环绳来转送煤车。又在搬运道上增多了电灯，此外各矿厂修理了一部分工人宿舍，四矿部分工人房内装上了电灯。
    在救济抚恤方面：各矿厂也初步贯彻了华北工商会议的精神。十一月间敌机射死三合铁厂工人刘焕义，即发给棺材一口、二百斤米与二百万元边钞的抚恤金。十月间四矿煤车撞死、坑内砸死工人各一名，除发棺材外，并各发四百斤米的恤金费。发电厂病死工人两名，照发棺木，其中一名发了三百斤米，另一名发四百斤米。工友们又互济了小米一百余斤。电工王治贺因病瞎眼，由保险费中发给四百六十斤小米的生活补助费后，送回原籍交由当地政府安置。八月间蒋机炸坏了该厂工人宿舍，工人衣被炸光，工厂补助工人约抵三分之一的损失。此外各矿厂工人因公受伤，也多照发了工资。
    阳泉各公营矿厂，某虽有上述成绩，但在些方面仍待改进，如某些矿厂对工人生病期间生活照顾很不够，三合厂有病工人王秋兰，病后仅发过一个月的工资，他因家口众多，生活极端困难，工友们资助给他一百六十万边钞，而职工会才发给他廿万边钞的救济费。该厂工人侯德功因病住院，欠下一百多斤小米的饭费，分工会仅付给他六十斤小米。四矿三个工人病了一个多月，每人仅救济了四十斤小米。各矿厂分工会的工人福利工作，则仍然在“处理善后”上面打圈子（即等事情发生了，找上门来才处理一下）。以后急应在工人群众中广泛开展福利教育，不断总结工人伤病原因，教育工人，使职工福利工作迅速转到积极方面去。
