　　The Japanese people are now closely watching the events in China, and the Chinese people are also closely watching the events in Japan. These two great nations of the Far East can and should establish a close friendship. But in the past, the imperialist forces of Japan hindered the development of this friendship. Japanese aggressors began by using economic and political methods, and later military methods, to invade China, triggering the Chinese people's eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. The result of the war was the defeat of Japanese imperialism. But then came American imperialism. America ruled Japan, violated the Potsdam Declaration issued by China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and agreed to by the Soviet Union in July 1945 regarding the eradication of Japanese militarism and the realization of Japanese democratization, and continued to implement a reactionary policy that hindered Sino-Japanese cooperation. Sino-Japanese relations now have a new outlook, because the Chinese people are about to achieve nationwide victory. Whether the American imperialists and their Japanese running dogs are willing or not, the People's China will intervene in the control of Japan, and Japan will sign a peace treaty with the People's China and establish economic and political relations. There is no doubt that the Chinese people are willing to establish a genuine and close friendship with the Japanese people, a friendship that will be very different from the creepy "friendship" spoken of by Japanese aggressors and the Kuomintang government's pro-foreign elements. This true friendship will bring great benefits to the people of both China and Japan. The liberated New China will faithfully assist Japan's democratic cause in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration and prevent the resurgence of Japanese reactionary forces. The Chinese people not only have nothing to rely on from the Japanese reactionary forces, but also have no reason to indulge and help the Japanese reactionary forces that oppress the Japanese people and threaten peace in the Far East, as the American imperialists and the Kuomintang government do. The people who are most qualified to lead Japan and establish a genuine and close friendship with the new China are the Japanese democrats, the Japanese communists and other democrats whose hands are not stained with Chinese blood. This simple truth must be fully known to all Japanese people.
　　The Japanese people will hold their third post-war general election on the 23rd of this month. This election, like the previous two, is still being conducted under the brutal interference of the American and Japanese reactionaries, and therefore cannot freely express the will of the Japanese people. However, every conscious Japanese worker, every conscious Japanese, when considering the future of Japan, cannot but look at the future of Japan's relationship with China, and cannot but listen to the voice of the Chinese people. The American and Japanese reactionaries are suppressing the election campaigns of the Japanese Communist Party and other genuine democrats, which shows their hostility and fear towards the interests of the Japanese people and the true friendship between the two nations of China and Japan. All those who sincerely hope that the Japanese people and Sino-Japanese friendship have a bright future should not be afraid of this oppression, and should elect more genuine democrats to the parliament in the election. This is beneficial both from the perspective of Japan's domestic situation and from the perspective of Japan's international situation.

### 日本的选举与中国

　　日本的选举与中国
    日本人现在正密切地注视着中国的事变，中国人同样也正密切地注视着日本的事变。远东这两个大民族可以而且应该建立亲密的友谊。但是在过去，日本的帝国主义势力妨害了这种友谊的发展。日本侵略者开始是用经济和政治的方法，后来是用军事的方法，侵入中国，引起了中国人民八年的抗日战争。战争的结果是日本帝国主义的失败。但是随即又来了美国的帝国主义。美国统治了日本，违背了中英美三国所发布并为苏联所同意的一九四五年七月关于肃清日本军国主义、实现日本民主化的波茨顿宣言，继续执行着妨害中日合作的反动政策。中日关系现在出现了新的展望，这是因为中国人民即将取得全国范围内的胜利。无论美国帝国主义者及其日本走卒愿意与否，人民的中国将要过问对于日本的管制，而日本将要与人民的中国签订和约，并发生经济的和政治的关系。毫无疑问，中国人民愿意与日本人民建立真正的亲密的友谊，这种友谊将与日本侵略分子和国民党政府的媚外分子所说的那种令人毛骨悚然的“友谊”大不相同。这种真正的友谊，将使中日两国人民都得到广大的利益。得到了自由的新中国，将要忠实地按照波茨顿宣言援助日本的民主事业而制止日本反动势力的从新发展。中国人民不但没有需要仰赖日本反动势力的东西，而且没有理由象美国帝国主义和国民党政府那样，对于压迫日本人民和威胁远东和平的日本反动势力，予以纵容和帮助。最有资格领导日本并与新中国建立真正的亲密的友谊的人们，乃是日本的民主分子，乃是那些手上没有染过中国人的血的日本共产党人和其他民主分子。这个简单的真理，必须让所有的日本人完全知道。
    日本人民将要在本月二十三日举行战后第三次大选。这次大选，和以前两次一样，仍然是在美国反动派和日本反动派的横暴干涉之下进行的，因此决不能自由表示日本人民的意志，但是每个投票的觉悟的日本劳动者，每个投票的觉悟的日本人，在考虑到日本的将来的时候，都不能不看一看日本与中国的关系的将来，都不能不听一听中国人民的声音。美国和日本的反动派，正在压迫日本共产党和其他真正民主分子的竞选运动，这正是表明他们对于日本人民利益和中日两民族真正友谊的仇视和恐惧。一切真诚希望日本人民和中日友谊有光明前途的人们，应当不害怕这种压迫，在选举中选举更多的真正民主分子到议会中来。这无论从日本的国内情势或是从日本的国际情势说，都是有利益的。
