Laborers Marrying Laborers
　Workers Hold a New Wedding Ceremony
　A Record of the Collective Wedding at Shijiazhuang 709 Factory
　　The 709 Factory felt like a big family, everyone was excitedly busy with wedding preparations; some were composing congratulatory couplets, some were cutting flowers, decorating, and practicing songs… everyone was working to hold a collective wedding for four pairs of working-class couples - model worker An Dalin, machinist Li Shujia, clerks Wang Diming and Tian Yabing, and female workers Yao Guihua, Cui Guirong, Cao Xiuzhen, and Zhang Bingjie.

　　On November 24th, the factory was especially lively, crowded with people everywhere. At the entrance of the auditorium, bright red lanterns illuminated the congratulatory couplets on both sides: "Celebrating the New Wedding of Liberation, Joyfully Watching the Flowers of Labor Freedom." In the center of the auditorium hung a red flag and a portrait of the leader, and a neat congratulatory plaque "Laboring Couples" hung on the main beam. The sides were filled with congratulatory couplets and messages, one of which read: "Four couples get married, joyfully and excitedly, thinking back and forth, we are so grateful to the People's Liberation Army for liberating the suffering people, so that bachelors can get married."

　　At 4 p.m. when the wedding began, all the factory workers, laughing and in groups of three or five, thronged into the auditorium. Factory Director Huo, Engineer Liu, and Comrade Dai from the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party all personally attended the wedding.

　　When the announcement of the wedding's commencement was made, amidst a burst of lighthearted singing, four female workers, representing the staff, presented flowers to the newlyweds. The bride and groom paid respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, bowed to the wedding officiant and guests, exchanged marriage certificates, and then shyly shook hands, eliciting cheers from the audience…

　　During the wedding ceremony, responsible comrades and guests all spoke. Director Huo acted as their marriage witness, first saying: "Marriages in the old society were transactions based on money, while marriages in the new society are unions based on labor. Only labor is glorious, and only labor brings happiness. I hope you will work even harder in the future." The introducer then said: "The introducers of today are fundamentally different from the matchmakers of the past. Matchmakers used money from both sides and swayed between them, not telling the truth and not allowing meetings, causing so many tragedies. Now, in the new society, things are different, marriage between men and women is autonomous."

　　The marriage introducer for model worker An Dalin was the union chairman, Yang Fade, who said: "Dalin worked for twenty years without marrying a wife. Now he is liberated under the leadership of Chairman Mao! He got married and started a family, and I hope he will work hard in production and never forget Chairman Mao after his emancipation."

　　Factory Director Xu was especially happy, smiling as he said, "You are all unions of labor. Yao Ronghua fell in love with An Dalin because he is a model worker. Cui Guirong fell in love with Li Shujia because he is a good worker." Then, Branch Secretary Dai, on behalf of the General Branch Committee, congratulated them, wishing them "to establish a new democratic family, help each other, make concessions to each other, work together, and grow old together."

　　Worker Ren Erxiao happily went on stage shouting, "Is it lively or not?"
　　"Lively!"
　　"Is it glorious or not?"
　　"Glorious!" The resounding answers, applause, and laughter shook the entire hall.

　　劳动人配劳动人
  　工人举行新婚礼
  　记石市七○九厂集体结婚
    七○九厂象个大家庭似的，大家都很兴奋的在忙着办喜事；有的编贺联、有的剪花、结彩、练唱歌……，大家都在为四对劳动夫妇——模范工人安大林、机匠李戍甲，职员王涤明、田亚冰，女工姚桂花、崔桂荣、曹秀珍、张丙姐举办集体婚礼。
    十一月廿四那天，工厂里特别热闹，到处挤满了人，礼堂门口艳丽的红灯照着两旁的贺联：“庆祝解放新婚礼，欢看劳动自由花。”礼堂正中挂着红旗和领袖像，一块端端正正的贺匾“劳动夫妇”挂在正梁上，两旁挂满了贺联贺词，有一付写着：“四对夫妇结新婚，欢天喜地乱纷纷，前思思、后想想，多亏咱解放军，解放了受苦人，光棍汉才能结了婚。”
    下午四时当婚礼开始时，全厂职工欢笑着，三五成群的拥进了礼堂，总厂霍厂长，刘工程师和中共总支委戴同志等，都亲自来参加婚礼。
    当宣布婚礼开始时，在一阵轻快的歌声中，四个女工代表职工曾向新人献花，新郎新娘向毛主席朱总司令致敬礼，向主婚人来宾等行了礼，交换了结婚证书，便羞答答的握握手，闹得满堂叫好………。
    婚礼会上负责同志和来宾都说了话，霍厂长做他们的证婚人，他首先说：“旧社会的婚姻是金钱买卖，新社会的婚姻是劳动结合，只有劳动才是光荣的，只有劳动才有幸福，希望你们今后更好的劳动。”介绍人接着说：“现在的介绍人和过去的媒婆子根本不同，媒婆子两头使钱两边摆，不说实话不让见面，造成了多少悲惨事；现在新社会不同了，男女间婚姻是自主的。”
    模范工人安大林的主婚人是工会主任杨发德，他说：“大林做工二十年，没有娶上媳妇，现在在毛主席领导下解放了！娶了媳妇成了家，希望他努力生产，翻身不忘毛主席”。
    徐厂长更是格外高兴，他笑着说：“你们都是劳动的结合，姚荣花看上安大林，因为他是模范工人。崔桂荣爱上李戍甲，因为他劳动好”。接着戴支委代表总支委向他们祝贺，祝他们“建立起新民主主义的新家庭，互助互让共同劳动，白头偕老。”
    工人任二小喜得走上台上嚷着：“热闹不热闹？”
    “热闹！”
    “光荣不光荣”？
    “光荣！”响亮的回答声、鼓掌声、笑声，震动了全堂。
