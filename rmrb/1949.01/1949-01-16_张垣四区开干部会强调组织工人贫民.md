Zhangjiakou News: The Fourth District of this city recently held a district cadre meeting to review the main shortcomings in the past few days' work, which was the overly cautious and hesitant work style. In the past ten days, the district has achieved certain results in cleaning up the remnants of the enemy and puppets and stabilizing social order. However, in mass work, more serious shortcomings have occurred, that is, it has only stopped at holding meetings of a few activists or individual conversations, a kind of handicraft-style work method. It failed to quickly shift the focus of mass work to mobilizing workers and urban poor. Therefore, the meeting decided to immediately change the work style, face the broad masses of workers and poor people, use the form of large and small meetings to explain the Party's various policies to them, and initially organize them.
    In the two days since the meeting, worker and poor people's congresses have been held separately in various streets. When the Tenth Street held a congress, more than 80 workers attended, with high spirits. The preparatory committee of the Tenth Street Trade Union was immediately established, and it was decided to establish workers' cooperatives. Other streets are also being organized. (Luo Ping)

　　张垣四区开干部会强调组织工人贫民
    【张垣讯】日前本市四区召开区干部会议，检讨出这几天工作中主要缺点，是工作作风上的小手小脚。旬日来，该区在清洗敌伪残余，安定社会秩序方面收到了一定成绩。但在群众工作中，却发生了比较严重的缺点，这就是只停留在开少数积极分子会议或个别谈话这样一种手工业的工作方式上。未能迅速把群众工作的重点转在发动工人及城市贫民身上。因此，会上决定要立即转变作风，面向广大工人贫民，利用大会小会的形式，向他们解释党的各种政策，并把他们初步的组织起来。
    会后两天来，在各街已分头召开了工人、贫民大会。只十街开大会时即到工人八十余名，情绪高涨。当即成立十街工会筹备会，并决定成立工人合作社其他各街也正组织中。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（罗平）
