Two Problems in the Autumn Grain Collection in the Beiyue District
    Bei Yue Branch
    Due to the inspiration that the new victories have brought to the people of the entire district, and due to the improvement of the people's political consciousness throughout the district, the collection work in the Beiyue District this year, as of November 25th, has completed 80% according to incomplete statistics. However, due to the inconsistent leadership in various places, and the serious problems that still exist in the implementation of the new agricultural tax regulations, the entire task has not been completed as scheduled. The counties on the periphery started earlier, while the counties in the rear only started collecting in early November. Among the various special districts, the Sixth Special District has performed better because of the better harvest and the tight grip of the leadership, so it completed the task on schedule, and the quality of the grain was also better. The Fourth Special District, because the leadership initially emphasized the large task and the severity of the disaster, lacked confidence, made deviations in taking care of the disaster situation and the elderly, weak, and orphans, and started late, failing to solve the problems in time, coupled with the impact of war preparations, completed the task poorly, completing only 75% by November 25th.

    In the implementation of the spirit of the new tax regulations, although the distribution of collection tasks among the special districts this year is more balanced than in previous years, according to post-event understanding, the tasks in the First and Sixth Special Districts are lighter. The distribution of tasks from each special district to the counties is also generally more detailed and closer to balance than in previous years. However, in the issue of balancing the burden between villages and villages, households and households, and in the implementation of the new agricultural tax regulations, the following serious problems still exist:

    First, there are still imbalances between special districts, counties, districts, especially between villages and villages, households and households: (1) Due to heavy workload and insufficient subjective efforts, it was not possible to adjust the output in advance, and the degree of disaster in various places was not accurately grasped, so each place was not allocated according to the burden of 25 catties per mu. (2) The leadership's thinking gave some extra consideration to poor mountainous areas: for example, Jianping and Jingxing were allocated only 20 catties per mu, while Zhengding was allocated more than 30 catties per mu. (3) The understanding of production investment in plains and mountains and the disaster situation in certain areas is not real enough, resulting in some disaster-stricken households bearing too heavy a burden. (4) The care for the elderly, weak, orphans, and families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers is not deducted according to the actual situation, forming a level-by-level delivery of tasks, resulting in some caring areas being too large: for example, in Lingxi, Yixian County, out of 400 households in the entire village, more than 70 households were taken care of, while some were not taken care of at all; some only took care of those who were out of town, and those at home were levied as ordinary people, especially the elderly, weak, orphans, and families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, because they lacked labor and fertilizer, and the harvest was very poor, certainly not just deducting 12.5 catties per person (deducting half a tax-exempt point more per person according to the fixed burden) that can compensate for it. Therefore, this part of the people feels particularly difficult or particularly heavy: for example, in Lingqiu Sufantong Village, the family of a soldier, Su Laopian, bears the same burden per mu as ordinary households, and after deducting the tax-exempt point by 1.5, the burden accounts for 89% of the total income, while Su Yongfu (non-military family) in the same village accounts for only 38% (this village is a disaster village), so the imbalance problem is more serious between disaster villages and non-disaster villages, and between households with labor and households without labor. This situation, in some cases, affects the completion of the collection, and in some cases, it does affect re-production and expanded re-production after the collection. Some even affect the lives of taxpayers, so in solving the imbalance problem, in addition to making great efforts to adjust the mu yield in the future, the policy must also solve the care problem for orphans, widows, the elderly, and the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers.

    The balance problem between the special districts, according to existing materials, is not very disparate; however, because the First and Sixth Special Districts have a better harvest, the burden seems lighter.

    Second, in violating the new agricultural tax regulations, there are the following problems: (1) The border areas of the Third Special District still convert the business situation of industrial and commercial households into burden mu and merge them into agricultural tax; or let industrial and commercial households report and discuss publicly; or the village formulates its own rules, how much rice is levied for the livestock of industrial and commercial households, and how much rice is levied for the merchants themselves (already corrected). (2) Livestock deduction issue: some large livestock are deducted, small livestock are not deducted; some who serve are deducted, and those who do not serve are not deducted; some are not deducted at all; and some do not make accurate statistics, not how many livestock there are, how much consumption is deducted, but generally distributed. (3) In taking care of orphans and widows, deducting tax-exempt points according to the degree of life difficulty: not taking care of according to the actual situation, some caring areas are wide, exceeding the principles; some only take care of those who are out of town, and those at home are deducted as ordinary people, and no care is given. The above problems have been instructed by the Beiyue Administrative Office to continue to be corrected and properly handled in various places.

　　北岳区秋征中的两个问题
    北岳分社
    由于新的胜利形势对于全区人民的鼓舞，由于全区人民政治觉悟的提高，今年北岳区的征收工作，截至十一月二十五日，据不完全统计，已完成百分之八十。但又由于各地领导情况不一，和执行新的农业税则上还存在严重问题，又影响了全部任务没有如期完成。边缘县份动手较早，后方各县至十一月初才开征。在各个专区中，六专因年景较好。领导上又抓得紧，所以成绩较好，按期完成了任务，粮食质量也较好。四专因领导上开始强调任务大、灾情重，信心不足，照顾灾情及老弱孤寡上发生偏差，又动手较晚，发现问题未能及时解决，更加以一度备战影响，完成任务较差，至十一月二十五日仅完成百分之七十五。
    在新税则精神的贯彻上，今年征收任务的分配，各专区之间，虽比往年进一步平衡，但据事后了解，一、六专区任务较轻，各专区对县的分配上，一般也比往年细致，接近平衡；但在村与村、户与户的负担平衡问题上，在执行新的农业税则上，还存在以下的严重问题：
    第一、在专、县、区特别是村与村、户与户之间，仍然存在着不平衡的现象：（一）由于工作繁重与主观努力不够，事前未能调整产量，又没有确切的掌握各地的灾情程度，以致各地没有按每个负担亩二十五斤的负担量分配。（二）领导思想上对山区穷区照顾有些多：如建屏、井陉每负担亩只分配二十斤，正定则每负担亩到三十斤还多。（三）对平原与山地的生产投资和某些地区的灾情了解不够真实。使得有的受灾户负担量太重。（四）照顾老弱孤寡和烈、军、工属，不是按实际情况扣减，形成逐级交付任务，以致有的照顾面大了：如易县岭西，全村四百户，就照顾了七十多户，也有根本不加照顾的；也有只照顾出外人员，在家者一律按一般人计征，特别是老弱孤寡与烈军工属，因为没有劳动力，又缺肥料，收成很差，绝不是每人少出十二斤半（按固定负担量每人多除半个免税点计），即能弥补上的。因此这部分人则感到特别困难或特别显得重：如灵邱苏凡同村军属苏老偏，每亩负担量与一般户同，按一点五除免税点后，负担占了总收入的百分之八十九，而同村的苏永富（非军属）则只占百分之三十八（这个村是灾村），所以不平衡问题，在灾村与非灾村之间，在有劳力户与无劳力户之间，便越显得严重了。这种情形，有的影响征收完成，有的则征收后，确实影响再生产与扩大再生产。有的甚至影响纳税户的生活，因此在解决不平衡问题上，除了将来用大力调整地亩产量外，还得在政策上解决孤寡老弱与烈、军、工属的照顾问题。
    各专区之间的平衡问题，根据现有材料推断，无很大悬殊；但因一、六专区年景较好，负担显得较轻。
    第二、在违犯新的农业税则上，有以下几个问题：（一）三专的边沿区，仍根据工商户的营业情形，折成负担亩合并到农业征税；或让工商户自报公议；或者村里自定章程，工商户的牲口征多少米，商人本身征多少米（已纠正）。（二）牲口除消耗问题：有的大牲口除，小牲口不除；有的服勤务的除，不服勤务的不除；有的根本不除；还有的不作精确统计，不是有多少牲口，除多少消耗，而是一般分配下去。（三）在照顾孤寡，按生活困难程度扣除免税点上：不根据实际情形照顾，有的照顾面广，超出了原则；有的只照顾出外人员，在家的按一般人扣除，不予照顾。上述问题已由北岳行署指示各地继续纠正与适当处理中。
