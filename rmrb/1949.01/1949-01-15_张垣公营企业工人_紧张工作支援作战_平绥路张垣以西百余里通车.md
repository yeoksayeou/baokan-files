　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd. Workers of the railway, post and telecommunications, power generation, electric lights, Yu＠ flour factory, soy sauce factory and other public enterprises in Zhangjiakou, which has been liberated again, are highly motivated and actively support the People's Liberation Army in combat. In order to rush to repair the Ping-Sui Railway, the repair workers, after completing the opening of the line from Zhangjiakou to Qinghuayuan, began to rush to repair the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway on the 28th. As of the 31st, they had completed the opening of traffic for 130 li (10 li west of Xiwanbao) west of Zhangyuan. The workers in the railway machinery factory also officially started work on the 31st. Ten of the eleven furnaces in the blacksmith shop were lit, and thirty-seven workers were actively forging railroad spikes. The machine shop was repairing locomotives, and the vehicle depot was repairing forty freight cars. In order to protect the railway factories, the workers have organized a picket team. They said, "We will take up guns to protect our factories ourselves." The power plant continues to supply power as usual, and the morale of the employees is particularly high. Originally, workers only cared about going to work and nothing else; now, in addition to going to work in shifts on time, everyone is digging air-raid shelters. In order to protect the transformers, they also built sturdy walls around the machines with bricks. On the 30th and 31st of last month, more than 20 workers quickly erected the high-voltage line to Xiayuan. The Yu＠ Flour Factory immediately resumed work after liberation and takeover. All the employees who remained in the factory responded to the call of the Military Control Commission and are rushing to produce flour with unprecedented labor enthusiasm to supply the People's Liberation Army. They proposed "machines don't rest when people do" and work in two shifts, day and night. The flour bagging workers extended their work to fifteen hours. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, from the 24th to the 28th of last month, they produced more than 140,000 jin of flour in four days and nights. All 245 employees of the former Zhangjiakou Telecommunications Bureau, from workers to the director, reported for duty and worked hard. The city's magneto telephones are operating smoothly, and the telephone line from Zhangjiakou to Xuanhua is being rushed to repair. In Zhangjiakou Post Office, all fifty-seven people, from the director to the postal workers, were completely on duty and protected all the post office's equipment, archives, and documents intact. The Military Control Commission dispatched personnel to take over on the 25th, and postal services were opened with various places on the 27th. In addition, road traffic inside and outside the city is also being actively restored. All 274 employees of the Wanquan Highway Section of the former Chahar Provincial Highway Administration, the Zhangji Transportation Section, and the Zhangjiakou Engineering Team have reported for duty and resumed work, and have turned in the buried instruments to the public. They are now actively rushing to repair highway bridges inside and outside the city. Public buses in the city have started running on the line from the station to Dajingmen on the 3rd. All the employees of the Second Automobile Third-Level Repair Factory of the Former Enemy Joint Logistics Department refused to execute the order of the bandit Fu to destroy or transport the machines before and after the liberation of the city, and armed themselves to protect the factory. When the People's Liberation Army entered the factory at 3 pm, everything inside the factory was in good order and not in the slightest chaos. The People's Liberation Army immediately transported six bags of white flour and millet and sent them to the workers. The next day, all the employees rushed to repair a large number of damaged vehicles for the People's Liberation Army to meet urgent military needs. Many workers worked for two days and two nights without rest and successfully completed the task.
