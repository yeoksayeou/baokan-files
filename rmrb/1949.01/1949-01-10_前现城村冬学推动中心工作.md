　　Qianxiancheng Village Winter School Promotes Central Work
    [Jinan News] Qianxiancheng Village in Yuanchao County has achieved success by closely integrating winter school with central work. The village has completed land reform, and the work has shifted to winter sideline production and the establishment of the Youth League. The teachers compiled teaching materials based on the central work of each stage. In terms of production, they compiled two ditties, such as "Partnering to buy livestock, no worries about farming," which taught everyone. They also mobilized students to make production plans, such as Cui Fenglin's plan: to leach 300 jin of salt, extract 50 jin of niter, make five carts of manure, and collect 200 jin of firewood before the end of the lunar year. In the work of establishing the New Democratic Youth League, because the young students listened to political current affairs classes, they improved their political awareness. Several people automatically requested to participate at once, and through their activities and deliberations, the number increased greatly. The teachers also used their morning running time to strengthen political education and stimulate learning enthusiasm. It has now been decided to conduct a morning of study after morning exercises. The young people have also automatically found a study room. Before the winter school was opened, the village cadres used a megaphone to shout for a long time to get everyone to attend each meeting, but now everyone arrives as soon as they are called. After the women participated in the study, their organization has also been strengthened. When the meeting is held, the "little teachers" lead them into the venue in neat rows. The students with average grades all understand the value of various banknotes; even the slowest students can distinguish the face value. The old ladies said: "When I go to sell thread next time, I won't need to ask anyone."

　　前现城村冬学推动中心工作
    【冀南讯】元朝县前现城村，冬学与中心工作密切结合获得成绩。该村已完成结束土改，工作转入了冬季副业生产与建立青年团。教员依据每一阶段中心工作编制了教材，在生产方面，曾编出“搭伙买牲口，耕地不发愁”两个歌子，教会了大家。并发动学员作出生产计划，如崔凤林的计划是：到旧历年底淋盐三百斤，提硝五十斤，造粪五车，拾柴二百斤。在建立新民主主义青年团的工作上，由于青年学员听了政治时事课，提高了政治觉悟，一次即有数人自动要求参加，又通过他们活动酝酿，人数大量增多、教员又利用他们早晨跑步时间加强政治教育，启发学习热情，现已决定早操后进行一上午学习，青年们并自动找好了一间学习室。没开办冬学前，该村每次开会，村干部用广播筒喊很长时间都到不齐，现在只要一喊就都到了。妇女们参加学习后，组织性也加强了，开会时由“小先生”带着排列得整整齐齐进入会场。学习成绩一般的都懂得了各种钞票的比值；进度最慢的也分清了票面价值了。老大娘们说：“再去卖线子可用不着问人了。”
