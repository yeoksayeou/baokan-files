　　How the Work in the New District of Huojia Was Carried Out?
　　Liang Cong
　　I. Landlords Play Tricks
　　After Huojia was liberated by our army, the landlords foresaw that their feudal rule of many years was coming to an end, and they used various methods to try to evade the struggle: fake family divisions, lavish eating and drinking, transferring property, and selling livestock. They secretly arranged to "re-elect" village cadres to steal power, and outwardly flattered our working personnel, while secretly threatening the masses not to talk to the workers; some even instigated workers to desert. The landlords of Zhangyi Village once held a secret meeting to attempt to shoot our workers in the back. They provoked by saying, "When the Eighth Route Army hadn't come yet, it was said they were disciplined and didn't enter civilian houses, how come the workers are going to this house and that house?" And they spread rumors: "The big noses (referring to the American army) have occupied Xuzhou." "The Jicha banknotes can't be used anymore, they will be worthless after the New Year." Because of this, Kangcun Town once used copper coins, and the urban area once saw a phenomenon of barter. Prices rose fivefold in two months. Later, as news of our army's series of great victories on various battlefields spread to every corner, the rumors were shattered, and the masses concluded about them: They're just talking nonsense.
　　II. The Masses Approach Us and the Attitude of Bandits and Puppet Personnel
　　After half a month of ideological mobilization, widespread publicity of our party's policies, and exposing shameless rumors, the masses gradually eliminated their ideological concerns and approached us. They already knew that only the Communist Party was reliable, and they no longer believed the deceptive propaganda of the Chiang bandits. When loans were issued in the Second District, an old woman was so moved that she kowtowed before a giant statue of Chairman Mao, saying, "I couldn't get by in the past, but they (referring to the Chiang bandits and the rulers of the village) extorted me dry; I used to think it would be better to die sooner, to save myself from suffering, but now that the Communist Party has come, I don't want to die anymore, I want to live a few comfortable years." After saying this, tears welled up in her eyes.
　　Among the Chiang bandit personnel who had been liberated, some behaved well. They said that they would not only hand over all their weapons and be good people in the future, but also asked to make meritorious service to atone for their crimes. They began to understand our party's policies and realized that Chiang Kai-shek had harmed them and the Communist Party had come to save them, which was a sign of turning back. Another part of the people adopted a wait-and-see attitude, wavering and hesitating, watching the development of the situation and whether our party's policies would change. Some went to the city to inquire about news, and some went to the old liberated areas to inquire about how land reform was carried out. A small number of people took a hard-line approach, knowing that they had hidden weapons but refusing to hand them over, still wanting to continue to harm the people. Recently, five or six robbery incidents have occurred in the rural areas of Huojia, mostly carried out at night or in small villages, seriously affecting the stability of social order.
　　III. The Key to Opening Up the Situation
　　Based on these circumstances, the work policy and tasks were determined to be: "Stabilize people's hearts through production and self-salvation, eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits, and stabilize social order." The specific approach: first, launch a propaganda campaign, the content of which is the current situation and our party's policies and production self-salvation, emphasizing opposition to the wasteful phenomenon of just eating and sitting around, and that labor is the most glorious. The handling of Chiang bandit personnel mainly involves letting them hand over their weapons and return to the people's side; they are not allowed to oppose the masses again, actively participate in production, and are allowed to make meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Regarding the village government issue, the conditions and standards for village cadres are put forward, so that the original old Baozhang can serve the people well, and they are not allowed to engage in destructive activities or threaten the masses. Those individual bad elements who repeatedly fail to be educated are punished and a notice is issued throughout the county. On the mass side, they should be mobilized to pour out their grievances, the scope of pouring out grievances should be broad, individual grievances are also acceptable, and grievances of three or five people are also acceptable, it is not necessary to move the old area experience. Pay attention to developing activists to prepare for the next step of work. The central link lies in relying on the masses, thoroughly eliminating the remnants of the Chiang bandit forces, eliminating the masses' ideological concerns, and protecting the interests of the people of all classes.
　　IV. Achievements of Half a Month's Work
　　Under the close cooperation of all cadres and the broad masses in the county, considerable achievements have been made in just half a month, mainly: In the collection of weapons from the remnants of the Chiang bandits, there were two machine guns, ninety-four rifles, eight hundred and twenty-three blunderbusses, twenty-three pistols, and more than eighteen thousand rounds of various bullets, and two telephone sets. The number of Chiang bandit personnel who registered for self-surrender was more than three hundred in the First and Fourth Districts alone. In propaganda work, according to statistics from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts: eighty-eight mass meetings were held (including twelve meetings of enemy and puppet family members), with participants from one hundred and ten villages, and more than twenty-three thousand seven hundred people received our propaganda; thirty village cadre meetings were held, with one thousand four hundred and eighty participants; the masses in twelve villages have begun to carry out production in an organized manner. According to different production methods, various types of production teams have been formed. According to a mass from Village × in the Fifth District who sold vegetables at Xiaoji Station and returned, "It didn't make much money in the past, but now it's much better, selling a cart of vegetables can earn six liters of rice." The working people are all happy, pushing their carts on the road and singing Henan Opera. The county held three training classes for intellectuals, activists, and enemy and puppet personnel, with more than one thousand four hundred people receiving new democratic revolutionary education. The first batch has ended, and the second batch is starting. All classes are gradually moving towards stability.
　　V. Sources of Achievements and Experiences
　　(1) Patient Propaganda, Eliminating Concerns
　　Propaganda must be earnest and combine the propaganda of current affairs and policies, expose the rumors and crimes of the Chiang bandits, and guide the masses in discussion. According to different objects, study their ideological concerns, and link them to their vital interests for explanation and propaganda.
　　(2) Do What You Say, Act According to Policies
　　The propaganda of policies must be combined with the implementation of policies, that is, do what you say, and no policy errors are allowed. For example, the handling methods for puppet personnel, etc., a slight carelessness will leave the enemy with an opportunity to take advantage of, and the masses will also have misconceptions about us. On the other hand, you cannot be timid and afraid of making mistakes everywhere. Especially for a large number of new cadres, the leadership must boldly use them and provide specific help and guidance.
　　(3) Mass Pressure, Disintegration and Winning Over, Family Meetings
　　To eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits, we must start from three aspects. First, we must explain the pros and cons to the people and create a mass movement. Second, we must use the contradictions between them to win over, disintegrate, isolate, and adopt different countermeasures according to different objects. There were two bandits, one of whom handed over his weapons, but the other did not. He was afraid that the other party would shoot him in the back, so he reported and exposed him, approached us, and asked for protection. We should ask them to make meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and give timely and appropriate praise for any strengths. At the same time, we should seize their education, so that they can thoroughly separate from the reactionaries ideologically and become anti-Chiang forces. Furthermore, we should hold family meetings to let their family members mobilize them to register for self-surrender and hand over their weapons. The Fifth District has achieved the greatest results in this regard. For example, Cao Xianji's wife in Nanwu Village mobilized Cao to hand over three pistols; after the Cao Zhenyuan family held a family meeting, Cao's father and his wife jointly mobilized Cao Zhenyuan, and as a result, four pistols were handed over.
　　(4) Differentiate Between Severity, Treat Differently
　　The motives of enemy and puppet personnel for joining the Chiang bandit army were different: some were afraid of being conscripted and transferred far away, so they joined local teams or rural Bao Gong Suo; some were to maintain their livelihoods; some were to find connections and rely on power to protect themselves, etc. Therefore, we must treat them differently in handling them, and cannot simply use administrative power or adopt capture methods. Because in the new district, this is a large and common problem. For example, in Huzheng Village in the Fifth District, more than one hundred households have more than one hundred guns, and the average number of rifles in each village in the entire district is more than forty. In Kangcun alone, there are more than eighty Chiang bandit personnel. Therefore, a slight carelessness in handling will cause social chaos.
　　(5) Overcome Relief Views, Loans Should Be Focused, Production Paths Should Be Pointed Out
　　To completely solve the problem of the people's livelihood, we must first overcome the simple relief view, advocate and implement the correct policy of production and self-salvation, universally call for production, and help the masses find production paths. In the new district, we do not emphasize organizing, otherwise, it will become a formality. Loans should be cautious. For example, a family in Gaolou Village, who had served as deputy of the enemy and puppet Bao team, was a landlord, and a famous black gunner, but he was a relative of Cui Gaocheng of our county branch, and he borrowed 500,000 yuan of Jicha banknotes for his family. In Xuying Village, a landlord who opened a grain mill also borrowed 500,000 yuan. The masses are very dissatisfied with this.

　　获嘉新区工作是怎样开展起来的？
    梁琮
　　一、地主们耍弄花枪
    获嘉被我军解放后，地主们预感到多少年以来的封建统治到了尽头，便利用各种办法企图逃避斗争：假分家，大吃大喝，转移财产，卖牲口。他们秘密布置“改选”村干部，窃取政权，对我工作人员明里逢迎，暗里威胁群众不让和工作员说话；有的活动工作员开小差。张义村地主们曾召开秘密会议企图打我工作员黑枪。他们挑拨说：“八路军未来时，听说还守纪律不进民宅，怎么工作员就这家走、那家串的？”并造谣：“大鼻子（指美军）占了徐州。”“冀钞不能用了，一过年就作废。”为此，亢村镇曾一度使用铜元，城关也一度造成以物换物的现象。两个月物价上涨五倍。后来我军各战场一连串的大胜利的消息传到各个角落后，谣言被击破了，群众给他们下了个结论：净是胡说八道。
　　二、群众向我靠近和匪伪人员态度
    经半个月的思想发动，广泛的宣传了我党政策，揭发了无耻谣言之后，群众逐渐消除了思想顾虑，向我们靠近，他们已经知道了只有共产党才是可靠的，他们再不相信蒋匪的欺骗宣传了。二区发放贷款的时候，有一位老大娘感动的到毛主席巨像前磕头，说：“我过去不是不能过的户，生叫人家（指蒋匪与村上的统治者）给讹诈干了；以前我光想不如早些死了好，省的受罪，现在共产党来了，我不想死啦，我要好好的过几年舒坦日子哩。”说了之后眼泪夺眶而出。
    在被解放了的蒋匪人员中，一部分人表现不错，他们表示不但把自己的武器全部交出来今后做个好人，并且提出要求立功赎罪，他们开始懂得了我党政策，更认识到蒋介石害了他们，共产党来拯救了他们，这是一种回头的表现。另一部分人是采取观望态度，动摇不定徘徊不已，看看形势的发展，看看我党政策是否会变，他们有的到城里打探消息，有的则到老解放区里去打听土改怎么进行的。其中一少部分人则采取硬顶的办法，明知道他暗藏的有武器，就是不交出来，仍想继续残害人民。近来获嘉农村中已发生抢劫事件五、六件，大部是在夜间或小村进行他们的破坏活动。对社会秩序的安定影响颇大。
　　三、开展局面的锁钥
    根据这些情况，决定工作方针与任务是：“通过生产自救，稳定人心，肃清蒋匪残余，安定社会秩序。”具体做法：首先开展宣传运动，内容是目前形势与我党政策及生产自救，强调提出反对光吃坐穿的浪费现象，劳动最光荣。对蒋匪人员的处理，主要让他们交出武器，回到人民方面来；不准再和群众作对，积极参加生产，允许立功赎罪。对村政权问题，提出村干部条件和标准，让原来旧保长们好好为人民服务，不准有破坏活动和威胁群众的举动。对个别坏的屡教无效者，给以惩办，并通令全县。在群众方面，要发动他们起来诉苦，诉苦的面要放阔，个别的诉苦也行，三五人诉苦也行，不一定要搬老区经验。注意发展积极分子，为下步工作做准备。中心一环在于依靠群众，彻底肃清蒋匪残余的势力，解除群众思想顾虑，保卫各阶层人民利益。
　　四、半月的工作成果
    在该县全体干部与广大群众密切配合下，仅半个月中曾取得了不少成绩，这主要是：收缴蒋匪残余的武器上，有机枪两挺，步枪九十四枝，抉枪八百二十三枝，手枪二十三枝，各种子弹一万八千余发，电话机两部。蒋匪人员自首登记者仅一、四区统计有三百余人。在宣传工作上，据三、四、五、六区统计：召开了八十八次群众大会（其中有十二次敌伪家属会议），参加者有一百一十个村，两万三千七百余人受到了我们的宣传；村干部会议三十次，参加人数一千四百八十余名；已有十二个村的群众开始有组织的进行生产。根据不同的生产方式，组成了各种类型的生产小组。据五区×村一群众到小冀车站卖菜回来说：“过去不大赚钱，现在可强多啦，推一车菜要嫌六升米。”劳动人民都是高高兴兴的，他们在路上推着小车，唱着河南梆子。全县召开了知识分子、积极分子、敌伪人员等三个训练班，有一千四百余人受到了新民主主义的革命教育。第一批结束，第二批又正在开始。各阶层逐渐走向稳定。
　　五、成绩的来源与经验
    （一）耐心宣传，解除顾虑
    宣传上必须苦口婆心，结合时事与政策的宣传，揭发蒋匪谣言与罪恶，并引导群众讨论。根据不同的对象，研究他的思想顾虑，联系他们的切身利益，进行解释宣传。
    （二）说啥就要做啥按照政策办事
    宣传政策与执行政策要相结合，就是说怎办就怎办，不允许犯政策错误。如对伪人员处理办法等，稍一不慎，便会给敌人留下可趁的机会，群众也会对我们发生错觉。另一方面，也不能小手小脚，处处怕错。特别是对大批新干部，领导上必须大胆任用并予以具体帮助指导。
    （三）群众压力、瓦解争取、家属会议
    要想肃清蒋匪残余，必须从三方面人手。首先要说明对人民的利害关系，造成群众性的运动。其次是利用他们互相之间的矛盾，争取、分化、瓦解、孤立，根据不同的对象，采取不同的对策。有两个匪徒，其中一人交了武器，但另一人不交，他就怕对方打了他的黑枪而报告检举，向我们靠近，要求保护。我们应向他们提出立功赎罪，有一点长处要及时适当的表扬。同时应抓紧对他们的教育，达到从思想上使他和反动派彻底分家，变为反蒋的力量。再者是召开家属会议，让其家属动员本人自首登记，交出武器。这方面五区收效最大，如南务村曹显吉女人动员曹交出了三枝手枪；曹振远家开了家庭会议之后，曹之父与其妻共同动员曹振远，结果交出了四枝手枪。
    （四）分别轻重、不同对待
    敌伪人员参加蒋匪军的动机各有不同：有的是怕抓了壮丁远调而参加了地方团队或乡保公所；有的为了维持生活；有的为了找门子靠势力保护个人等等。所以在处理上必须分别对待，不能单纯使用行政力量，采取捕捉的办法。因为在新区这是大量而普遍的问题。如五区胡郑庄全村百余户就有一百余支枪，全区平均每村都在四十枝步枪以上。蒋匪人员，仅亢村就有八十余人。所以处理稍一不慎，即会造成社会混乱。
    （五）克服救济观点、贷款要有重点、生产门路要指点
    要想彻底解决群众生活问题，首先必须克服单纯的救济观点，提倡与执行生产自救的正确方针，普遍号召生产，帮助群众找出生产门路。在新区不强调组织起来，否则就会流于形式。贷款要慎重，如高楼村一家，曾任过敌伪保队副，是地主，并是有名的黑枪手，但他和我县支行崔高成是亲戚，他一户便贷了五十万元冀钞。在徐营村也是一户地主，开粮食坊，贷了五十万元。对此群众很不满意。
