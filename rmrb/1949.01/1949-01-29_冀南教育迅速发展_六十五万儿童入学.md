(Jinan Telegram) With the victory of the Liberation War and the universal emancipation of the peasants, culture and education in southern Hebei have rapidly recovered and developed. Primary school education was largely suspended during the Anti-Japanese War due to the devastation of the Japanese puppets and the famine of 1941, with only 2,000 primary schools and 50,000 students in the entire region. After the Japanese surrender, through the vigorous construction of the People's Government and the teachers' efforts to implement the new democratic education policy, improve management and teaching methods, and provide various conveniences for the children of the working people to attend school, children flocked to the schools in large numbers. During the Liberation War, teachers worked actively under a lower supply system to support the front lines. In order to reduce the burden on the people, some personally led students to repair school buildings. Zhang Zhen, the principal of the Yuanchao Seventh District Center, insisted on working despite suffering from illness and frequently spitting blood. Female teacher He Shuyu was still working two hours before giving birth. Chen Shuangcai, a female teacher in Hengshui, who did not know abacus, ran seven miles to the complete primary school every week to learn and then taught it to her students. At the beginning, very few students enrolled in He Zhao Primary School in Wei County. The teachers, in cooperation with the village cadres, patiently mobilized the parents and children. As a result, the number of students increased from 15 to 120. In order to give poor children the opportunity to go to school, the government provided subsidies to poor students who passed the examination. In the past three years, more than 30,000 students have been subsidized with public funds, and the expenditure of subsidized rice has reached 20 million catties. Shixian Shilong Complete Primary School subsidized 105 students, with a monthly expenditure of 2,000 catties of rice. At present, 9,500 primary schools have been established in the region, which is more than four times the number before the Japanese surrender, and the number of students has reached 650,000, which is 13 times the number before the Japanese surrender. The number of higher primary schools has increased to 288, with 23,232 students. In terms of social education, more than 1.5 million people regularly attend winter schools and people's schools, accounting for more than a quarter of the adults. Most of the teachers are intellectuals in the countryside, who do not take any remuneration. Women's literacy classes are also very common. They are mostly integrated with production organizations, producing and learning at the same time. Learning has increased their enthusiasm for production and support for the front lines. Female students educate them, and they take time to go to the groups as little teachers. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8,000 of the more than 12,000 villages in the region have established such learning organizations, and 700,000 women have been educated. 12,000 blackboards have been set up in towns and villages throughout the region. Because it powerfully reflects the lives of the masses and is closely connected with the masses, the blackboard is always crowded with people after each new content is changed. The blackboards in Handan City are read by about 3,600 people every day. The blackboards in Linqing City also have an inquiry column to help the masses solve problems, which is enthusiastically supported by the masses. Libraries are set up in various cities to purchase and collect a large number of books and subscribe to various newspapers for workers, markets, and businessmen to read. There are also lectures. The Linqing City Library regularly lends out more than 100 books every day, and readers and listeners come and go every day. In addition, in carrying out social education, there are also various methods such as radio stations, literacy boards, and wall newspapers, which have played a great role in improving the cultural and political level of the masses and stimulating the enthusiasm for production and supporting the front lines. Secondary schools and specialized schools: have also been developed in recent years. Seven secondary schools have been established with 1,700 students. There is also a financial and economic school, and the first phase graduated last year, all of whom participated in financial and economic construction work in the front or rear. The second phase is still in learning. Nitrite sulfur and agricultural and forestry specialized schools have also been established successively. The Jinan Construction College is the highest institution of higher learning in Jinan. It was established in the autumn of last year and is striving to train a large number of talents for national construction.
