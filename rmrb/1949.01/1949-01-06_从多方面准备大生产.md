　　From Multiple Perspectives Prepare for Large-Scale Production
　　Accumulate Firewood Now, Produce Well Next Spring

　　To prepare for next year's large-scale production, the Guan Sanhai mutual aid group in Nanlin Village, Qinyuan First District, began accumulating firewood on November 28th. In eight days, the fourteen people chopped 16,400 jin of firewood, averaging more than 200 jin per person per day, which is one-third more than working individually (each person only chopped 140 jin per day). Group leader Guan Sanhai said, "We guarantee that the entire group will accumulate enough firewood for ten months this winter."

　　Grain from the Manure Pile

　　Cadres in Anle Village, Qinyuan, have specific divisions of labor to lead winter manure accumulation, and have achieved initial results. On November 29th, they made their first summary, counting fifteen sheep pens that had been lined, 1,124 carts of cow pen and street sweeping soil removed, 32 loads of manure collected, and eight piles of road manure lined (approximately 320 loads). Every household is currently irrigating with night soil, and every family is paying attention to accumulating dirty water. Work on accumulating fuel has also begun, with 161 loads of firewood already chopped, preparing well for next year's production. (Wenzheng)

　　The masses in Wulongtang Village, Shen County Twelfth District, are going to Cheng Village, twelve li away, and Yuanxitou Village, eight li away, to haul pit soil back to line pens and make manure. They say, "One cart of soil, one cart of manure, mixed evenly is even more powerful." They also say, "White soil and pit soil can yield five shi per mu." Jiang Laohui leads more than a dozen carts to haul soil from other villages twice a day. In two months, he has already made twenty-five carts of manure. He always harvests more grain than others every year because he benefits from using pit soil and leaves to make manure. Jiang Chaozheng is raising a pig and is diligent in lining the pen and carrying water. He has already made three pens of manure. He farms fifteen mu of land and plans to apply two applications of manure next year. Wang Dongchang and Bao Shun run a tofu workshop and raise two large sows. They grind tofu in the morning and evening, and haul pit soil in their spare time, accumulating a lot of manure. Now, the area around this village is full of piles of pit soil.

　　Geng Laokai Raises Breeding Cattle, Massively Propagating Small Livestock

　　Geng Laokai from Nanxinzhuang, Shen County Twelfth District, raises a breeding bull. Because his breeding bull is well-built, well-fed, and managed with experience, the mating is accurate. People from around forty li away bring their cows to mate. In order to dispel the masses' concerns about wasting money if the mating is unsuccessful, he stipulated that payment would be deferred until after a calf is born. This has increased business. This year, thirty-eight cows from Zhao Xing Village, Chengxi, and Gaozhuang alone have been mated. Wang Laodeng from Dongwang Village, who raises two cows, had two calves this year after mating with Laokai's breeding bull. Laodeng happily said, "Having a calf every year from my big cow is better than farming two more mu of land!"

　　Geng Laokai has raised this breeding bull for four years and has mated it with a total of six hundred and fourteen calves. He sees that this business is very profitable, earns money without interfering with production, and propagates small livestock, for which the government also provides rewards. Therefore, in September of this year, he bought another small breeding bull.

　　Use Windfall Profits to Buy Waterwheels, No Difficulty Irrigating Next Year

　　Hezhuang Village, Shulu First District, uses surplus windfall profits to buy agricultural tools, preparing for next year's large-scale production. They sold the leftover scrap copper and iron from the windfall profits and bought eight old waterwheels. They also sold the stored, undivided broken wood, tables, chairs, etc., and bought ten new waterwheel wheels. The old waterwheels need to be repaired, and the newly bought waterwheels need buckets, axles, and frames. However, the village has no funds. Branch Secretary Che Yongqi discussed it with other cadres and decided to exchange the stored purlins for waterwheel frames, use broken ironware to make axles, and use confiscated locust trees to make buckets.

　　After the materials were prepared, they began repairing them during the winter slack season. They hired a blacksmith and a carpenter, and more than twenty people from the village participated. They have already started repairing. The masses are saying, "Seemingly insignificant things have been exchanged for eighteen waterwheels, making farming much more convenient after the New Year."

　　Dig Channels to Draw Water to Irrigate Wheat, Striving for a Bumper Harvest Next Summer

　　Tuzhai Village, Lincheng, is actively repairing channels to irrigate wheat fields. Led by Wang Qingxian and Wang Wenqi, nine people organized and built a new channel, laying the foundation for irrigating wheat next year. Seeing how good this is, saving labor and irrigating more land, the masses have increased their confidence in repairing channels, and a mass channel repair movement has now been created.

　　Also: The Production Committee of Dongchuan Village, in order to bring forward the winter water (irrigating wheat), called on the masses to repair channels on the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month. Under the leadership of the Production Committee, twenty people from the entire village automatically went and completed the channel in one day. That night, they irrigated seven or eight mu of wheat land. This water can irrigate more than forty mu of land. It is estimated that it can be completed in four or five days. The masses are saying that this is due to the early repair of the channel.

　　从多方面准备大生产
  　今冬多积柴　明春好生产
    为准备明年大生产，沁源一区南赁村，劳动英雄关三孩互助组，从十一月二十八日起，已开始积柴。十四个人在八天中，就打了柴一万六千四百斤，平均每天每人砍柴二百多斤，比起不互助干活，要多作三分之一（各干各，一个人每天只砍一百四十斤）。组长关三孩说：“保证全组今冬要积够十个月烧的柴火。”
  　粪堆里出粮食
    沁源安乐村干部具体分工，领导冬季积肥，已获初步成绩。十一月二十九日，作了第一次总结，计垫羊圈十五个，出牛圈、扫道土一千一百二十四车，拾粪三十二担，垫道粪八堆（约三百二十担），各户蒿肥都正在灌大粪、家家都注意积脏水。对积存燃料工作，也已开始，已打柴一百六十一担，给明年生产作好准备。　　（文正）
    深县十二区五龙堂村群众，纷纷到十二里外的程村和八里外的元西头村去拉坑土，回来垫圈造粪。他们说：“一车土一车粪，调合匀更有了劲。”还说：“白土和坑土，一亩打石五。”蒋老会每天带着十几辆大车到外村去拉两趟土，两个月已经造了二十五车粪，他每年总比别人家打粮食多，就沾了坑土树叶造粪的光。蒋朝正养着一个猪，垫圈挑水很勤谨，现在已经造了三圈粪。他种着十五亩地，打算明年上两楂粪。王东常和宝顺开着豆腐坊，养着两个大母猪，早晚磨豆腐，抽空就拉坑土，攒粪很多。现在这村四周一堆连一堆的满是坑土。

    耿老开养种牛　大量繁殖小牲口
    深县十二区南辛庄耿老开，养着一个种牛，因为他的种牛长的好，喂养的好，管理有经验，所以交配的准，周围四几十里地的群众都牵着牛找来交配。他为了打破群众怕交配后成不了白花钱的顾虑，便规定交配后暂不收钱，有了小牛以后再给。这样一来买卖更多了，只赵刑村、程西、高庄三个村，今年就有卅八头母牛进行了交配。东王庄王老登养着两个母牛，经过和老开的种牛交配，今年下了两个小牛，乐的老登说：“我这大母牛每年下一个小牛比多种二亩地还强哩！”
    耿老开这个种牛养了四年了，共交配成了六百十四个小牛。他看到这个买卖好处很大，赚了钱又耽误不了生产，繁殖了小牲口，政府还奖励，所以在今年九月里又买了一个小种牛。

  　用浮财买水车　明年浇地不困难
    束鹿一区河庄村用分余浮财买农具，准备明年大生产。把分浮财剩的碎铜烂铁卖了，买了八辆破旧水车。又把存着没分的破木头、桌、椅等卖了，买了十辆新水车轮子。旧的水车需要修理，新买的水车得置斗子、轴和架子；可是村里没有款了。支部书记车永奇和别的干部商量了一下，把存着的檩条换成水车架，破铁器打成轴，把没收的槐树做斗子。
    东西准备齐全以后，他们就趁冬闲开始修理起来。请来了一个铁匠一个木匠，并有本村二十多人参加，现在已经开始修理。群众都说：“不起眼的点东西换了十八辆水车，过年种地可方便多了。”

  　开渠引水浇麦　争取明夏丰收
    临城土寨村积极修渠浇麦地。由王庆先、王文奇二人领导组织了九个人，修了一条新渠，打下明年浇麦子的基础。群众看到这样好，又省工又能多浇地，对修渠提高了信心，现在已造成了群众性的修渠运动。
    又：东川村生产委员会，为了提早上冬水（浇麦子），于旧历十月十六日号召群众修渠。在生产委员会的领导下，全村自动去了二十个人，一天就把水渠修通了，当天夜里就浇了七、八亩麦地。这股水能浇四十多亩地。计算起来四、五天就可浇完。群众都说这可沾了提早修渠的光。
