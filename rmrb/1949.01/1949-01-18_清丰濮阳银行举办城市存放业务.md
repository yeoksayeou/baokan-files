　　[Jilu Yu Electric] Qingfeng Branch of the People's Bank of China and Puyang Bank, in order to invigorate finance, promote the market, and support the development of industry and commerce, have launched urban deposit and loan businesses, and have achieved results. From July to the end of August, Puyang Bank absorbed public and private deposits of 638.8 million Jicha; various loans amounted to 17.55 million. In October, Qingfeng Bank absorbed a total of 56 million deposits. The development of deposit and loan business has played a considerable role in supporting the development of industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market. Puyang Yiju Oil Shop borrowed 500,000, repaid the loan on August 27, and earned a net profit of more than 890,000 yuan after deducting interest and various expenses. Under the support of loans, the number of industrial and commercial households in Qingfeng increased from 177 in August to more than 20. The Hongda Cooperative, which received loan support, has started making hand-dipped matches. Each worker dips 10 bundles a day, earning a salary of 1,000 yuan, which can maintain one person's livelihood. This also has great indirect benefits in solving the lives of urban poor people. At the beginning of the deposit and loan business, in order to dispel merchants' ideological concerns about deposit and loan, meetings were held with merchants to explain the deposit and loan policies and significance, explaining that the deposit is to organize scattered idle funds to engage in production; this not only enables depositors to obtain interest, but also plays a role in economic mutual assistance, turnover, and adjustment, and guarantees convenient withdrawals and deposits, and will never delay matters.

　　清丰濮阳银行举办城市存放业务
    【冀鲁豫电】人民银行清丰支行和濮阳银行，为活泼金融，繁荣市场，扶助工商业发展，特举办城市存放款业务，并已获得成效。濮阳银行自七月份开始至八月底止，吸收公私存款冀钞六亿三千八百余万元；各种放款一亿七千五百余万元。清丰银行十月份共吸收存款五千六百万元。由于存放业务的开展，给予工商业发展和市场繁荣上起了相当作用。濮阳义聚油行贷款五十万，八月二十七还了款，除利息与各种开支外，净赚纯利八十九万余元。清丰工商户在放款扶植下，八月份原有一七七户，现又增加了二十余户。获得贷款支持的宏大合作社，手工沾洋火现已开始，每天一个工沾十封，工资一千元，能维持一个人的生活。这对解决城市贫民生活上，也间接地有很大利益。在开始存放时，为了解除商人对存放款的思想顾虑，均召开了商户会议，讲明存放政策和意义，说明存放是在于使分散的闲余游资组织起来从事生产；这不但使存户能获得利息，而且能起到经济互助，周转与调剂的作用，并且保证取存方便，决不误事。
