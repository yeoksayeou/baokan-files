The Taiyue Second Prefectural Committee recently issued instructions pointing out that in the current land reform work, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of party-masses relations by some comrades, and the failure to fully implement the mass line, there exist phenomena of commandism and acting on behalf of the masses. Some basic-level cadres even use coercive methods to suppress the masses, seriously damaging the relations between the Party and the masses. The Prefectural Committee demands that all levels of Party organizations pay serious attention to these problems and take effective measures to resolutely correct them.

The instructions emphasize that properly resolving party-masses relations is the central link to ensuring the thorough completion of land reform and consolidating the revolutionary order. All levels of Party organizations must deeply understand the importance of party-masses relations from the perspective of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship.

The instructions put forward the following specific measures:

1.  Resolutely implement the mass line. All work must be discussed with the masses, and the masses must be fully mobilized to participate in land reform. We must listen carefully to the opinions of the masses, respect their democratic rights, and never impose our will on them.

2.  Overcome commandism and formalism. Cadres must go deep into the masses, conduct thorough investigations and studies, and understand the actual situation. We must patiently persuade and educate the masses, and never use coercive methods.

3.  Strengthen the education of basic-level cadres. We must educate basic-level cadres to understand the importance of party-masses relations, improve their work methods, and enhance their mass viewpoint.

4.  Seriously handle cases of violating the law and discipline. Those who seriously damage party-masses relations must be severely punished.

The Prefectural Committee calls on all Party members and cadres to resolutely implement these instructions, strengthen party-masses relations, and ensure the smooth progress of land reform.
