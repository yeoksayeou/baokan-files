　　Developed School Education in the Soviet Union
  　Number of Schools Reaches 200,000

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] TASS reported: The Soviet Union currently has 200,000 schools, far more than before the war. The Soviet people have vigorously restored all school buildings destroyed by the German fascist aggressors. In the Russian Federal Republic alone, 21,500 school buildings have been rebuilt. At the same time, new schools have also been established. The Russian Federal Republic has built 2,154 new schools in the past year and a half. There are currently 33.2 million primary and secondary school students in the Soviet Union. After graduating from primary school, 90 percent of students enter secondary school. Before the revolution, in Yakutia, in the far north of the Soviet Union, only 0.7 percent of the population was literate. Today, if someone accidentally encounters an illiterate person in Yakutia, it can only be an old man with white hair. The village of Khalunke Shan in Kainer, Semipalatinsk Oblast, eloquently proves that the Soviet government's policy is to universally improve the culture of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Thirty years ago, this place was completely illiterate. Now the village has its own ten-year school, and 45 people from the village are receiving higher education.

　　苏联学校教育发达
  　学校数目已达二十万所
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联现有二十万所学校，远较战前为多。苏维埃人民以大力恢复了被德国法西斯侵略者所破坏的一切学校建筑。仅在俄罗斯联邦共和国，就已重建了二万一千五百座学校建筑。同时，新的学校也已建立起来，俄罗斯联邦共和国在过去一年半内新建了二千一百五十四所学校。全苏现有三千三百二十万名中小学生。小学毕业以后，有百分之九十的学生进入中学。革命前，在苏联极北的雅库蒂亚，只有百分之零点七的人口是识字的。今天，如若有人偶然在雅库蒂亚碰到一个文盲，那只能是白发的老头。塞米巴拉卡斯克州卡伊那尔的哈隆克山村，雄辩地证明了苏维埃政府的政策是普遍提高苏联各民族的文化的。三十年前，这个地方完全没有识字的，如今村子里有他自己的十年制学校，该村并有四十五人正在学校中受高等教育。
