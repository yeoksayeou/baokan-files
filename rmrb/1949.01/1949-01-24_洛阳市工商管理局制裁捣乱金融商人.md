Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 14th. The Luoyang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce resolutely sanctioned Ren Yutai, an illegal merchant who violated the decrees of the People's Government by engaging in black market trading of gold and silver, disrupting finances, and undermining the market. Before October of last year, Ren, under the guise of operating a cigarette shop, secretly bought and sold gold. After being reported, he established Tianbao Silver Shop, but still failed to comply with government decrees and continued his illegal business. On December 22nd of last year, when the price of gold was 29,000 Zhongzhou currency per tael, Ren sold one tael, five mace, one fen, and five li of gold to Wang Dayi and Zhang Yulun of a merchant firm at a high price of 35,000 yuan per tael. Upon receiving the news, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce immediately investigated and confirmed that the shop was indeed involved in black market gold trading, as well as illegal silver dollar transactions. Evidence from the investigated receipts showed that on December 8th alone, the shop's silver dollar transaction volume reached 46 yuan. On December 18th alone, it traded 32 taels, 9 mace, and 6 fen of gold. With the material evidence irrefutable, Ren Yutai admitted that his illegal transactions were true. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce has now announced the suspension of the silver shop's operations and handed Ren Yutai over to the People's Court for handling. It also convened a symposium of all members of the Silver Shop Association, publicized the illegal activities of Tianbao Silver Shop in disrupting finance, and reiterated the government's decrees regarding the legitimate business scope of the silver shop industry.
