(Jizhong News) To prepare for next year's large-scale production, farmers in Xicheng and Jiezhuang in Shenze are actively repairing and purchasing waterwheels. These two villages have a total of 288 wells and 140 waterwheels. Some wells do not yet have waterwheels, and 64 of these waterwheels are broken, accounting for more than 45 percent of the total number of waterwheels. After learning about this situation, the water conservancy work team held a forum with veteran farmers to understand the main reasons for the waterwheels being broken. Then, they mobilized the masses to carry out repairs. However, it was learned from the forum that there were difficulties in repairing. For example, no one was willing to take the lead for fear of paying in advance; some people were unwilling to repair because they had labor to irrigate; and many households that borrowed wells only used them but did not repair them. Later, after explanation and mobilization, and with the help of the water conservancy work team, some people were willing to repair.

According to the condition of the broken waterwheels, the water conservancy work team consulted with the county production promotion agency and organized a forge to repair them. In less than a month, twenty vehicles were repaired in Xicheng Village. Jiezhuang is also preparing to repair. At the same time, with the organization of the water conservancy work team and the help of government loans, many people bought new waterwheels. Xicheng Village bought a total of sixteen, and Jiezhuang bought four. When organizing the masses to buy waterwheels, most of the masses were very willing, and they asked the work team to organize them. However, some people requested loans when repairing and buying waterwheels. The work team used accounting methods to call on the masses to actively develop sideline production to solve the funding problem; and explained that the government could help those who were really in difficulty. After such explanation, the masses began to collect private funds for repairs.

　　深泽西城解庄
  　积极修置水车
    【冀中讯】深泽西城、解庄农民为准备明年大生产，积极修理和置买水车。这两村共有井二百八十八眼，共有水车一百四十辆，一部分井还没有水车，这些水车还有六十四辆坏的，占总水车数的百分之四十五还多。水利工作组，了解了这些情况以后，就召开了一个老农座谈会，了解了坏水车的主要原因，接着就动员群众进行修理。可是从座谈当中了解到修理有困难。如：没有人出头，怕垫款；有的人困为有劳力浇不愿修理；借井户多，光管使不管修理。后来经过解释动员，并由水利工作组帮助，有些群众才愿意修理了。
    水利工作组，根据坏水车的情况，和县生产推进社商量好，组织了一个行炉来修理。不到一个月的工夫，就在西城村修理了二十辆。解庄也正在准备修理。同时，在水利工作组的组织和政府贷款帮助下，好多群众买了新水车。西城村共买了十六辆，解庄买了四辆。在组织群众买水车时，大部群众很愿意，他们要求工作组给组织。可是，也有的群众在修理水车和买水车时，要求贷款。工作组就用算帐的方式，号召群众积极开展副业生产，来解决资金问题；并说明对实在困难的，政府可以帮助。经过这样的解释以后，群众就开始集私资修理。
