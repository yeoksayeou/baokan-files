Hebei Daily Editorial Calls for
Overcoming the Tendency to Simply Issue Land Certificates, Appropriately Resolving Various Remaining Issues

[Our Newspaper News] The work of ending land reform in the Jizhong District, with "issuing land certificates as the central link," has been launched in about 95% of the villages in the district, and some villages have already completed it. During the issuance of land certificates, various places have generally combined the distribution of houses and floating wealth, corrected wrongly designated class status, appropriately compensated middle peasants, and stabilized the production enthusiasm of all classes, laying a good foundation for this year's large-scale production. However, due to the short time, heavy tasks, and some ambiguities in the leadership's thinking, policies could not be well implemented, leading to a tendency to simply issue land certificates. In order to overcome these tendencies, correctly implement policies, and continue to complete the ending of land reform, the Hebei Daily published an editorial, first analyzing the specific manifestations of several deviations in this period of work:

(1) In some places, the issuance of land certificates at the end of land reform was not carried out with in-depth mobilization and reliance on the masses. Some cadres still retained the remnants of paternalism and acted timidly, so a broad mass movement was not created in these places. (2) Some areas only carried out the issuance of land certificates in isolation, without paying attention to resolving the remaining issues in land reform, and even regardless of whether feudalism was eliminated and whether the demands of poor peasants and farm laborers were appropriately met, resulting in the phenomenon of "half-cooked rice" in some villages. Landlords and rich peasants still possessed more land than the average land held by poor peasants and farm laborers. The land that should have been taken out was not taken out, and the conditions that could have been used to satisfy poor peasants and farm laborers were not met. For example, according to statistics from eighteen villages in Jianguo, there were more than 100 poor peasant and farm laborer households that had the conditions to be satisfied but were not. In Botou, some landlords relied entirely on renting out houses and land for a living, but still occupied a large amount of land, and land certificates were issued to them as well. This kind of land certificate issuance is not consolidating the vested interests of poor peasants and farm laborers, but mistakenly protecting the feudal property of the landlord class, thus helping to foster the counter-offensive arrogance of some reactionary landlords and rich peasants. (3) On the issue of correcting policies and uniting middle peasants, many places showed vacillation. In some villages, compensation was not resolutely given to those who had been wrongly classified and whose interests had been seriously harmed. In some villages, regardless of the circumstances, there was a one-sided emphasis on taking care of and compensating households that had been wrongly struggled against, and all property was returned without principle. Among these right-leaning deviations, according to the situation in various places, right-leaning tendencies were more common. (4) On the issue of distributing houses and floating wealth, many areas did not proceed from the policy of rewarding labor, developing production, and giving priority to solving the production and living materials of poor and hard-working peasants, but committed egalitarianism. Without distinction, lazy people and loafers who did not actively work on weekdays and peasants who did not lack materials were given a share of floating wealth. Some mechanically divided into grades, and even some village cadres and representatives were selfish and took more fruits for themselves, etc.

The editorial analyzes the reasons for these deviations: First, the party committees at all levels did not pay enough attention to the correct implementation of policies in their leadership. In the specific work of implementing the policy of ending land reform, there was a lack of in-depth inspection and timely guidance, and the policy education for cadres was very poor. Secondly, 60 to 70 percent of the district-level cadres were new cadres who had just been promoted from the villages. Their policy level was low and their work experience was limited, so they would unconsciously vacillate on certain specific policy issues. However, some new district cadres had been punished or improperly dealt with during last year's land reform. Some had not clarified their thinking, and they still had prejudices and dissatisfaction with land reform and some poor peasant and farm laborer representatives in the village. When dealing with problems from this perspective, deviations often occurred intentionally. Finally, some areas also experienced a tendency to abandon leadership, which seriously affected the correct implementation of the Party's policies.

The editorial calls on party committees at all levels and cadres in various places to conduct in-depth inspections, overcome various deviations, and summarize new experiences in order to finally complete the great task of ending land reform, thereby turning to preparing for this year's agricultural production.

(1) The Lunar New Year is approaching, and spring plowing and production preparations will begin soon after the Spring Festival. Therefore, villages that have largely completed the ending of land reform and can complete it before the New Year should seize the time to achieve complete completion before the end of the year. Another part of the villages that cannot actually be completed before the end of the year should not be forced to complete, resulting in "half-cooked rice." They should use the Spring Festival holiday to continue implementation, combined with production preparations, to complete everything before spring plowing. In all areas and villages that have completed the ending of land reform and the issuance of land certificates, various preparations for large-scale production should be started immediately.

(2) Party committees at all levels must recognize that the purpose of ending land reform and issuing land certificates is to consolidate the vested interests of the poor and hard-working people and stabilize the production enthusiasm of all classes in order to facilitate the transition to restoring and developing production. Therefore, in ending land reform and issuing land certificates, we must also pay attention to confiscating the excess land of a few landlords and resolving the various issues left over from the equal distribution of land. We must not simply and isolatedly issue land certificates like the past tax deed exchanges.

(3) In ending land reform and issuing land certificates, we must firmly and correctly grasp and implement various policies for ending land reform. For middle peasants who have been wrongly classified, their classification must be corrected. For those middle peasants whose rights have been infringed upon too heavily, whose remaining land is too small in quantity and too low in quality, affecting their production and livelihood, they must be given appropriate compensation without hesitation. For some middle peasants who have been infringed upon to some extent, but whose existing land quantity and quality are not lower than the village's average land or not much different, emphasis should be placed on clarifying the reasons to them politically to strengthen the unity within the peasantry. For middle peasants whose certain items of floating wealth have been infringed upon but do not affect their lives and production, those that have already been distributed should be explained and persuaded, and no further return should be made. Those that have not been distributed should mainly return livestock, carts, and other production tools. Other small items that have been lost or messed up should also be explained and persuaded, and no old accounts should be settled.

(4) The distribution of houses and floating wealth must correctly implement the policy of distributing according to need, rewarding labor, and being conducive to developing production and uniting the peasants.

(5) Finally, in continuing the final completion of the work of ending land reform, the leadership of counties and districts over villages must be strengthened. For those villages that have been delayed until after the New Year and before spring plowing to complete the ending of land reform, each county must redeploy various specific tasks for continuing to complete the ending of land reform based on the specific situation. We must strive to do a good job in each village and strictly prevent possible relaxation and laissez-faire phenomena. Especially for villages that are being handled by village cadres themselves, thorough arrangements must be made in advance to ensure that village cadres understand the spirit of the various specific policies for ending land reform and issuing land certificates.

The editorial concludes by pointing out that although the great movement of ending land reform and issuing land certificates in the entire district has been fully launched and is nearing completion, there is still a final arduous process. The people of the entire district, party committees at all levels, and all cadres must continue to work tirelessly and make unremitting efforts to further correctly implement the Party's policies in order to finally and completely accomplish this historically significant great task.

### 河北日报社论号召　克服单纯发土地证偏向适当解决各种遗留问题

　　河北日报社论号召
  　克服单纯发土地证偏向适当解决各种遗留问题
    【本报讯】冀中区以“发土地证为中心环节”的结束土改工作，已在全区百分之九十五左右的村展开，部分村已经完成。在发土地证中，各地一般都结合了分配房屋浮财，改正错订成份，适当补偿中农，稳定各阶层生产情绪，给今年大生产准备了良好基础。但由于时间短任务重和领导思想上的某些模糊，致政策不能很好贯彻，形成单纯发土地证的偏向，为克服这些偏向，正确贯彻政策，继续完成结束土改，河北日报特发表社论，首先分析了这段工作中几种偏向的具体表现：
    （一）有些地方，在结束土改发土地证中，没有深入的发动群众和依靠群众去办，有些干部仍然残存着包办，小手小脚，因此在这些地方就没有造成广泛的群众运动。（二）有些地区，只孤立片×面的进行发土地证，不注意解决土改中遗留下的问题，甚至不管封建是否消灭，贫雇农要求是否适当满足，以致有些村庄发现了夹生饭的现象；地主富农仍保有较贫雇农土地平均数为多的土地，应抽出的没有抽出，对贫雇农有条件满足的没有满足。如建国十八个村统计，有一百多户贫雇农都有条件满足而未达到；泊头对有的地主完全依靠出租房屋土地生活的，仍占有多量土地，竟也同样发给土地证。这样填发土地证就不是巩固贫雇农的既得利益，而错误的保护！地主阶级的封建财产，因此助长了某些反动地富的反攻气焰。（三）在端正政策团结中农上，很多地方则表现左右摇摆，有些村庄，对错订成份伤害中农利益较严重的，应当补偿的不坚决补偿；也有些村庄则不分情节，片面强调照顾补偿错斗户，无原则的一律退还。在这些左右偏向中，根据各地情况，右的偏向则是较多的。（四）在分房产分浮财问题上，很多地区不是从贯彻奖励劳动，发展生产与尽先解决贫苦劳动农民的生产与生活资料的政策出发，而是犯了平均主义。对于平日不积极劳动的懒汉二流子和不缺少资料的农民，不加区别，不合理的都同样分给一份浮财，有的机械的划分等级，甚至有些村庄干部代表，自私自利多占果实等。
    社论分析发生这些偏差的原因：首先是由于各级党委在领导上对正确的贯彻政策注意不够，在具体工作中对于结束土改政策的贯彻，缺乏深入检查和及时指导，对干部的政策教育做得很差。其次也由于在区级有百分之六、七十是刚从村里提拔出来的新干部，他们政策水平较低，工作经验尚少，因而在某些具体政策问题上，会不自觉的发生左右摇摆。但也有一部分新的区干部，曾在去年土改时受了处罚或处理不当，有些没有打通思想，他们对土地改革和村里某些贫雇农代表还存有成见和不满，从此出发处理问题，则常是有意发生偏差的。最后也由于有些地区发生了放弃领导的偏向。严重影响了党的政策的正确贯彻。
    社论号召各级党委和各地干部，应该进行深入检查，克服各种偏向，总结新的经验，以最后完成结束土改的伟大任务，从而转向准备开展今年的农业生产。
    （一）现在已经临近旧历年节，而春节以后不久就要动手准备春耕生产。因此目前凡已大部完成结束土改的村庄在年前可以完成的，就应抓紧时间在年底前做到全部完成。另有一部分村庄，在年底前实际不能完成的，就不要强求完成，而做些夹生饭；就应利用春节空闲，继续贯彻进行，结合准备生产，在春耕前全部完成。在一切完成结束土改发土地证的地区和村庄，应即着手进行大生产的各项准备工作。
    （二）各级党委必须认识结束土改发土地证目的在于巩固贫苦劳动人民的既得利益，稳定各阶层生产情绪，以达到有利于转入恢复和发展生产。因此，在结束土改发土地证中，必须同时注意没收少数地主多余土地，解决平分土地中所遗留下的各项问题，不能象过去税契换契一样单纯去孤立发土地证。
    （三）在结束土改发土地证中，必须紧紧的正确掌握贯彻结束土改各项政策。对于错订成份的中农，必须改正；对于侵犯中农过重，所留土地数量太少质量太低以致影响其生产与生活的，必须毫不犹豫的坚决给以适当补偿。而对于有些中农虽曾受到一些侵犯，但现有土地数量与质量并不低于全村土地平均数或相差不多的，则应着重从政治上向其说清道理，达到加强农民内部团结。对于中农被侵犯某些浮财并不影响其生活生产的，已分者应向其说服解释，可不再退，未分者主要应退还牲口、大车等生产工具，其他细小的物品或已丢失弄乱的，亦应向其说服解释，不要再算旧帐。
    （四）分配房产浮财，必须正确贯彻按照需要，奖励劳动，利于发展生产又利于农民团结的方针。
    （五）最后在继续最后完成结束土改工作中，必须加强县区对村的领导。各县对于那些延到年后和春耕前完成结束土改的村庄，必须根据具体情况，重新布署继续完成结束土改的各项具体工作。争取做一村就做好一村，必须严格防止可能发生的松懈和自流现象。特别对于村干部自己做的村庄，事前要做周密的布置，使村干部领会结束土改与发土地证的各项具体政策的精神。
    社论最后指出全区结束土改发土地证的伟大运动，虽已全面展开接近完成，但仍有最后一段艰苦过程。全区人民，各级党委，全体干部，必须不懈不怠，继续奋发努力，进一步正确贯彻党的政策，以最后全部完成此有历史意义的伟大任务。
