Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Reports from various sources: The war of aggression launched by seven Arab countries, including Egypt and Transjordan, under the manipulation of British and American imperialism, against the newly established State of Israel in mid-May of last year, has suffered a tragic defeat. Not only did the Israeli military and civilians resist the invaders, but they also drove the Egyptian invading forces out of the Negev region in December of last year. Due to the military defeat and under the pressure of opposition from the people in their own countries, the Egyptian government has agreed to direct negotiations with Israel. According to UN Acting Mediator for Palestine, Mr. Bunche, in his statement to the UN Security Council's Palestine Committee on the 8th of this month: Israel and Egypt have agreed to a ceasefire starting at noon on January 7th and to direct negotiations to resolve the Palestinian dispute.

When British imperialism saw that its policy of eliminating Israel through its puppet states was about to fail completely, it is now uniting with the United States in an attempt to directly provoke a new war to strangle Israel. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 3rd, the British Ambassador to the United States, Franks, warned the United States in a recent secret meeting with Lovett that "the defeat of the Arab armies has brought the volatile situation in the Middle East to a dangerous stage." On the 10th of this month, Britain shamelessly protested to Israel, citing the incident of five of its aircraft, which had been assisting the Egyptian army in combat, being shot down on the Egyptian-Israeli border on the 7th, and concentrated its warships on the island of Malta in preparation for armed intervention in Israel. The British Foreign Office also announced that Britain had "dispatched troops to Aqaba in Transjordan at the request of the Transjordanian government." In commenting on this British action on the 10th of this month, the French newspaper L'Humanité pointed out that Britain's new aggression in the Middle East makes the face of the warmongers clearly visible to the people of all countries.

　　英帝扶植侵略战争失败后
  　又图武装干涉以色列
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：在英美帝国主义操纵下的埃及、外约旦等七个阿拉伯国家，自去年五月中旬对新生的以色列国所发动的侵略战争，业已遭受悲惨的失败。以色列军民不仅抵挡了侵略者，而且于去年十二月间把内革布的埃及侵犯军远远地驱出国境。由于军事上的惨败，以及在本国人民反对的压力下，埃及政府已同意与以色列直接谈判。据联大巴勒斯坦代理调停人彭区在本月八日安理会巴勒斯坦委员会上宣称：以色列与埃及双方已同意自一月七日正午开始停战，直接谈判以解决巴勒斯坦争执问题。
    当英帝国主义看到它通过其傀儡国以消灭以色列的政策行将完全失败时，现正联合美国，企图直接挑起新的战争，以扼死以色列。据合众社华盛顿三日电：英国驻美大使佛兰克斯在最近与罗维特的秘密会谈中曾警告美国说：“阿拉伯军队的败北，已使中东的不安局面达到了危险的阶段”。本月十日，英国无耻地借口其协助埃军作战之五架飞机，于七日在巴埃边界被击落一事，向以色列提出抗议，并将其军舰集中于马尔他岛，准备武装干涉以色列。英外交部并宣布：英国已应“外约旦政府之请求派兵前往外约旦的阿喀巴”。法国人道报本月十日在评论英国这种行动时指出：英国对中东的新侵略，使各国人民明白看清了战争贩子的面目。
