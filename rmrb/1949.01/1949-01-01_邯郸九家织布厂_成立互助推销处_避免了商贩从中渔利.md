　　Handan Nine Weaving Factories
  　Establish Mutual Aid Sales Office
  　Avoid Merchants Profiteering
    [Handan News] Since the weaving factories in the city established a mutual aid sales office, they have gained practical benefits and broken the old idea that "competitors are enemies." Before the establishment of the sales office, the finished products of each factory were sold by merchants, which had many problems. For example, when sales were slow, they desperately lowered prices and did not give cash; when sales were fast, they sold at high prices and extracted huge profits from the difference. Some even deliberately defaulted on loans and treated them as their own capital. This greatly hindered the production of the factories. In order to make capital turnover flexible and facilitate the expansion of production, nine factories jointly established this mutual aid sales cooperative and formulated regulations: (1) Each factory takes turns on duty, two days each time. (2) Each factory sends goods early and picks them up late, settling accounts on the same day. The person on duty is responsible for short goods and fake bills. (3) The sales office has no expenses or expenditures. (4) Each factory sets the price of the goods, implements a fixed price policy, and the salesperson is not allowed to change it. (5) All colleagues are welcome to send goods for consignment sales, only deducting 0.5% of the remuneration. (6) Hold a regular meeting once a week to review shortcomings and seek improvement. On the fifth day of the establishment of the mutual aid sales office, it has achieved a sales performance of more than 1.1 million yuan. After each factory obtained the actual benefits of mutual assistance, it further improved the spirit of mutual assistance and combined in the procurement of raw materials. Collective procurement of raw materials not only saves trouble but also saves money. A bag of foreign thread saves 120,000 yuan compared to retail purchases, which everyone is very satisfied with. In collective sales, slow-selling goods sell slowly, and fast-selling goods sell quickly, which has also sparked a competition among factories to improve quality.

　　邯郸九家织布厂
  　成立互助推销处
  　避免了商贩从中渔利
    【邯郸讯】本市各织布工厂，成立互助推销处后，已得到实际利益，并打破了“同行是冤家”的旧思想。在成立推销处之前，各厂的成品，都是由商贩来推销的，这里面有不少的毛病。例如在销路不畅的时候，他们就拼命的压低价格，不给现款；销路快的时候，就高价出卖，从差额中吸取厚利，有的还故意不还贷款，当成自己的资本。这样，工厂的生产受到了很大的阻碍。为使资金周转灵活，便于扩大生产，有九家工厂联合成立了这个互助推销社，并订立规约：（一）各工厂轮流值班，每次两天。（二）各厂将货早送晚取当日清帐。短货、假票由值班负责。（三）推销处没有任何花销、开支。（四）各厂将货价订好，实行言不二价，销货员不得更改。（五）欢迎各同业将货送来代卖，只抽千分之五的报酬。（六）每星期例会一次，检讨缺点，求得改进。互助推销处成立的第五天，已获得卖出一百一十多万元的成绩，各厂在得到了互助的实际利益后，更加提高了互助的精神，并在采购原料上结合起来，原料的集体采购，不但省事而且省钱，一包洋线就比零买省十二万元，大家都很满意。在集体出售中，坏的卖的慢，好的卖的快，这在提高质量上也掀起了各厂的竞赛。
