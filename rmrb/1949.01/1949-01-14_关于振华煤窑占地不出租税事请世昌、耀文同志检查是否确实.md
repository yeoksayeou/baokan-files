Column: Review and Response

　　To the Editors:
　　Having read the "Inquiries and Answers" section on page four of the 185th issue of the People's Daily, regarding the Zhenhua Coal Mine occupying land from the masses without paying rent or tax, this does not conform to the facts. The explanation is as follows, hoping for a correction.
　　Before the land reform, our Mingchang occupied less than two mu of An’yang woodland in Xitianhe Village, with an annual rent of eight silver dollars. During the land reform, this household was liquidated, and the land was not received by the poor peasant association. After the land reform, the village's new peasant association and the heads of the poor peasant association, Yang Ming, Zhu Lin, and others, told us that the current occupied land, together with the nearby two-plus mu, totaled more than four mu, which would not be distributed externally but would be retained as Mingchang. This July, when the village was creating the agricultural tax, they proposed to bear the agricultural tax, but did not discuss how much to bear. At that time, we felt that mining is an industry, and Mingchang is used for burning coke. If we were to pay, we should pay industrial tax, and paying agricultural tax would be inappropriate. However, we did not say that we would not pay, only that we would ask the district. Later, we met District Chief Zhang in the village and talked about this matter. He said, "If Mingchang occupies it, you don't have to pay. I will study it when I return to the district." On November 7th, we met District Chief Zhang again in Xitou Village, and he also said, "It has been decided that you will not pay!" Since the land reform, this land has not been distributed externally, and no one has ever asked us for rent! Comrades Shichang and Yaowen reported that no rent or tax was paid. Where did they get their materials? We hope that these two comrades will strive for truthfulness when reporting problems in the future.

### 关于振华煤窑占地不出租税事请世昌、耀文同志检查是否确实

专栏：检讨与答复

　　关于振华煤窑占地不出租税事请世昌、耀文同志检查是否确实编辑同志：
    阅人民日报一八五期第四版“询问与答复”拦，刊有振华煤窑占群众土地不出租税一事，与事实不符，兹说明如下，希更正。
    土改前，我处明场占西天和村安阳林地不足二亩，每年租钱白洋八元；土改时，该户被清算，此地没收到贫农团；土改后，村新农会与贫农团负责人杨明、朱林等告我们，现占地与附近二亩多，共四亩多，不往外分配，留做明场。今年七月，村造农业税时，提出叫负担农业税，但亦没谈负担多少分数。当时我们感到开矿系工业，明场为放烧焦炭用，要出应当出工业税，出农业税不妥，但并未说不出，只说相互问问区里吧。后在该村遇到张区长，谈及此事，他说：“要是明场占即不用出，我回区研究一下。”十一月七号，在西头村又碰到张区长，还说：“决定不叫你们出了！”自土改迄今，该地并没往外分配，亦从无任何人向我们讨要过租子！世昌、耀文二同志反映说不出租税，其材料不知在何处所得？敬希该二同志今后再反映问题要力求真实才好。
