　　Unscrupulous Merchants Peddle Fake Alkali, Deceiving People
　　[Beiyue News] The Second Industry and Commerce Tax Bureau of Lingshou County uncovered a case of unscrupulous merchants manufacturing and selling fake alkali. Half a month ago, farmers and merchants in various markets in the county reported that the alkali blocks they bought (were fake), and they ruined the dough when making cakes and malt sugar. On the 8th of this month, the Tax Bureau found Zhang Ziying, Zhang Chunhai, Shi Qingqi, Shi Xiaowan, and Wu Xiaoshou, from Shuangjing Village, Seventh District, Ningjin County, in Ciyu Village. On the 1st of this month, they brought a total of 147 jin of fake alkali from their homes to sell in Shijiazhuang, Huolu, Dahe, Lingshou and other places. They confessed that this substance was the residue left over from leaching saltpeter and was of no use. They ground it into powder with a stone mill, sifted it with a fine sieve, boiled it into blocks, and sold it as alkali. This substance tastes very cool, but it dissolves when rubbed by hand. They have deceived many customers. In addition to confiscating their goods, the Tax Bureau, considering that they were first-time offenders, released them after education.

　　奸商捣鬼假碱骗人
    【北岳讯】灵寿县第二工商税务局，查获制卖假碱奸商一起。半月前，该县各集市农民、商人纷纷反映：买的碱块（假的），做饼、打麻糖把面都坏了。本月八日，税务局于慈峪村查得宁晋县七区双井村张子英、张春海、时青起、时小万、武小寿等五人，于本月一日，从家带出假碱共一百四十七斤，至石家庄、获鹿、大河、灵寿各地出售。彼等供认：此物是淋火硝剩的渣子，毫无用处。他们把它用碾子碾成面后，用细罗筛过，熬成块当碱出卖。此物尝着很凉，但用手一搓就化了；曾欺骗了很多主顾。税务局除将彼等物品予以没收外，因系初犯经教育后即行释放。
