Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th - Women's representative conferences have been convened in major cities in Northeast China, including Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Andong, Jiamusi, Jilin, Mudanjiang, Qiqihar, and Yingkou, to elect delegates to the All-Northeast Women's Congress and prepare proposals. The Shenyang Women's Congress opened on the 15th of this month and ended on the 17th. After heated discussions, the meeting established the preparatory committee for the Shenyang Women's Federation. Based on the city's current general guideline of "consolidating urban security and preparing to launch large-scale production," the meeting proposed the following tasks for the city's women's work in the future: (1) Mobilize and organize working women and female workers to actively engage in production; (2) Promote women from all walks of life to actively participate in various production and construction projects, as well as in government, cultural, and social education work; (3) Publicize and explain the policies and laws of the democratic government and the deeds of female labor heroes in the old liberated areas; (4) Help women establish or strengthen their labor concepts to change the old ideological consciousness of undervaluing labor left over from the old society. The congress also put forward specific requirements for the work of women in various sectors as follows: Female factory workers should establish new labor attitudes, improve their skills and abilities, and actively participate in the management of factories; female intellectuals should establish the idea of serving the people and do their jobs well; female residents should actively participate in consolidating social security and transforming street governments.

The Second Harbin Women's Congress was convened on the 12th and lasted for three days. In addition to summarizing the work of women in Harbin over the past three years, the meeting also put forward the tasks of the women's movement in the city in the future, namely: (1) Mobilize all female workers and working women to actively participate in factories and various handicrafts and sideline production, improve skills and increase output; (2) Mobilize women from all walks of life, especially working women, to respond to the government's call and actively participate in democratic elections; (3) Improve the political and cultural level of female workers and other working women, and publish popular reading materials; (4) Protect the interests of female workers, advocate the establishment of private and public-assisted day care centers to reduce the difficulty for female workers in taking care of children, and mobilize midwives and female nurses to go deep into the countryside to serve rural women; (5) Unite female intellectuals, cultivate female cadres, and run various training courses and technical research institutes in a planned and focused manner; (6) Improve the organizational structure of women's mass organizations, and women's work cadres should overcome the tendency to not pay attention to women's work.

At the beginning of this month, women in Changchun held separate forums for female workers, female teachers, female students, female cadres, female medical workers, and female staff members to elect representatives to the Northeast Women's Congress. The Andong Women's Congress not only formally established the Municipal Women's Federation and summarized the past achievements of women's participation in production, but also reviewed the past biases in women's organizational work, such as neglecting the organization of middle-aged and elderly women and the failure of existing women's organizations to effectively solve the personal problems of women, etc.
