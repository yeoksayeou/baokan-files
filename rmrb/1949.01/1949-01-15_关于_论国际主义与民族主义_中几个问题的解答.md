To the Editor:

We are currently studying Chairman Mao's "Unite All Revolutionary Forces in the World to Combat Imperialist Aggression" from Jizhong Daobao No. 1544, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism" published in the border region edition on November 10th. There are several questions we only understand superficially and not thoroughly, so please provide us with answers:

1.  In the first paragraph of "Unite All Revolutionary Forces in the World to Combat Imperialist Aggression," it says: "The great significance of the October Revolution... Thirdly, in this way, it erected a bridge between the socialist West and the enslaved East, and established a new revolutionary front against world imperialism from the Western proletariat, through the Russian revolution, to the oppressed nations of the East." We are not sure what is meant by the "socialist West."

2.  In the first section of "On Internationalism and Nationalism," it says: "Therefore, the 'national question' in various different periods, serves various different interests, and has various different colors, and this is based on which class and when this question is raised." We do not understand this paragraph. Please provide specific examples.

3.  In the fourth paragraph of the first section, it says: "Capitalism oppresses and exploits other nations whenever possible, sacrificing the interests of other nations and diverting a portion of the spoils from foreign plunder to buy off a portion of the people at home, to ease and divide the opposition of its own people against it." Which portion of the people does it buy off? In what way? Please provide examples, preferably a foreign example.

4.  In the fifth paragraph of the first section, it mentions the bourgeoisie during the American War of Independence and the American Civil War, the bourgeoisie of the French Revolution, and the bourgeoisie during the Italian unification movement. Because we are not familiar with world history, please tell us in detail.

Regarding the questions you raised, here are the answers:

1.  The "West" usually refers to Europe, here meaning the capitalist countries of Europe and America. The "East" refers to Asia, here meaning the oppressed nations of Asia and elsewhere. Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, etc., are all imperialist countries. The task of the proletariat there is to overthrow the rule of their own national bourgeoisie. The nature of their revolution is socialist. The "socialist West" refers to the Western socialist proletariat. The East is mostly composed of colonial and semi-colonial countries. The revolutionary task in these countries lies in overthrowing the enslavement of foreign imperialism and the feudal rule of their own countries. The "enslaved East" refers to the broad masses of people in the East enslaved by imperialism and feudal forces.

2.  Stalin's paragraph is very important. The entire text is based on this paragraph. Read the entire text carefully and repeatedly. Once you understand the entire text, this paragraph will naturally become clear. The meaning of this paragraph, simply put, is: First, the national question must be viewed from the perspective of whether it is raised by the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. If it is raised by the bourgeoisie, it is for the purpose of oppressing the people at home and aggressing against other nations abroad. If it is raised by the proletariat, it is for the purpose of resolutely opposing any national oppression, both opposing other nations oppressing one's own nation and opposing one's own nation oppressing other nations. Therefore, it is necessary to see "which class... raises this question." The national question program of the bourgeoisie serves the interests of the bourgeoisie. The national question program of the proletariat serves the interests of the proletariat (and also of all mankind). Moreover, whether the bourgeois or proletarian national question program, at different times, has different purposes and serves different interests. Hence the saying: "serves various different interests." Second, the national question program must be viewed in terms of when it is raised. The bourgeoisie sometimes participates with the people in the struggle against the oppression of other nations and feudalism, and sometimes it invades and conquers other nations, and sometimes it betrays its own nation and becomes a national traitor. In different periods, the bourgeois national question program has different colors, the root cause of which lies in serving the specific different class interests of the bourgeoisie. The proletariat in the oppressed nations must resolutely oppose the oppression of imperialism. In the nations that oppress others, it must resolutely oppose the imperialists of its own country. In nations where the revolution has already been victorious, it must immediately abolish all oppression of domestic and foreign nations. In different periods, the proletarian national question program has different colors, the root cause of which lies in serving the specific different interests of the proletariat (and also of all mankind). There are many examples in the full text, which will become clear with careful reading. Taking the American bourgeoisie as an example, in 1776, because the United States was subjected to British oppression, the bourgeoisie, for its own class interests, put forward "nationalism" and, together with the people, carried out a struggle against British oppression. But after its victory, when it reached the point where it could oppress other nations, the bourgeoisie put forward the argument that "Americans are the most superior race in the world," deceived the people at home, and carried out aggression against other nations, such as supporting Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule in China, invading China, creating a puppet government in the Philippines, and armed suppression of the people's revolution in Greece after the Second World War.

3.  The bourgeoisie of imperialist countries often uses money or positions to induce the upper strata of the working class, turning them into labor aristocrats, to ease and divide the opposition of its own people against it. Certain upper-level figures in the social democratic parties and trade unions of many Western European countries are the running dogs bought off by the bourgeoisie. For example, the British Trades Union Congress Chairman, the traitor Lowther, after being bought off by the bourgeoisie, recently instigated the Standing Committee of the trade union to pass a resolution demanding that the progressive World Federation of Trade Unions cease its activities, otherwise the association would withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions, attempting to undermine the worker's movement. This resolution has been opposed by the broad masses of workers.

4.  The American War of Independence was a war in 1776 in which the American bourgeoisie and the people resisted British enslavement. The American Civil War was in 1861. At that time, the southern states of the United States practiced a system of black slave labor and decentralized state power, while the northern states had developed industry and did not use black slaves. Therefore, the North American bourgeoisie felt quite aggrieved in commercial competition, and thus the Civil War broke out. The North was victorious, and the black slaves were liberated. The French Revolution was in 1789 when the French bourgeoisie, in order to get rid of feudal shackles, led the people to overthrow the feudal system. The Italian unification movement was in 1859 when the Italian bourgeoisie mobilized the people to oppose Austrian rule in northern Italy. Because these wars took place in the early days of capitalism, the working class was very weak at that time, so they were all led by the bourgeoisie, and as a result, they seized the fruits of victory. However, because they were all against the rule of foreign nations or domestic feudal forces, they were progressive in a certain historical sense.

### 关于“论国际主义与民族主义”中几个问题的解答

　　关于“论国际主义与民族主义”中几个问题的解答编者同志：
    现在我们正在学习冀中道报第一五四四号上毛主席著的“全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略”，及边缘区版十一月十日所登载的刘少奇同志著“论国际主义与民族主义”。内有几个问题我们只是表面上了解，不很彻底明白，故请您们解答：
    一、在“全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义侵略”的第一段内说：“十月革命的重大意义。………第三、这样它就在社会主义的西方和被奴役的东方架起一道桥梁，建立了一条从西方无产者，经过俄国革命到东方被压迫民族的新的反对世界帝国主义的革命战线”，不知所谓“社会主义的西方”是指何而言？
    二、在“论国际主义与民族主义”第一节中说：“因此‘民族问题’在各种不同的时期，服务于各种不同的利益，具有各种不同色彩，而这是以那一个阶级和在什么时候提出这个问题为依据。”这一段我们不明白，请具体举例说明。
    三、在第一节第四段中说；“资本主义在可能的时候就去压迫，和剥削其它民族以其它民族的利益为牺牲并从国外的掠夺中分出一部分以收买国内一部分人，去和缓与分裂本国人民的对他的反对。”他收买那一部分人？用什么方式？请举例说明，最好举一个外国的例子。
    四、第一节第五段中说：美国独立战争与南北战争时的资产阶级，法国大革命的资产阶级，意大利统一运动时代的资产阶级，因我们不知道世界历史，请详细告诉我们。

    关于你们所提的问题兹解答如下：
    一、所谓“西方”通常是指欧洲，这里是说欧美的资本主义国家。“东方”是指亚洲，这里是说亚洲等地的被压迫民族。英、美、法、德、意等都是帝国主义的国家，那里无产阶级的任务，是推翻其本国资产阶级的统治，其革命的性质是社会主义的，“社会主义的西方”就是指西方社会主义的无产阶级来说的。东方多为殖民地半殖民地的国家，这些国家里的革命任务，在于推翻外国帝国主义的奴役及本国的封建统治，“被奴役的东方”是指东方被帝国主义及封建势力所奴役的广大人民群众来说的。
    二、斯大林这一段话很重要，全文以这段话为根据，把全文用心仔细多读几遍，全文都懂了，这段话自然就很明白了。这段话的意思，简单说来，就是第一，民族问题要看是资产阶级提出或是无产阶级提出，如资产阶级提出，则为对内压迫国内人民，对外侵略别的民族；如无产阶级提出，则为坚决反对任何的民族压迫，既反对别的民族压迫自己民族，又反对自己民族压迫别的民族。所以要看“那一个阶级………提出这个问题”。资产阶级的民族问题纲领为资产阶级的利益服务，无产阶级的民族问题纲领为无产阶级的（同时也是全人类的）利益服务，而且无论资产阶级或无产阶级民族问题纲领，在不同的时候，都有不同的目的，为不同的利益服务，所以说：“服务于各种不同的利益”。第二，民族问题纲领看在什么时候提出。资产阶级有时和人民一起参加反对其他民族压迫和封建主义压迫的斗争，有时就去侵略并征服其他民族，有时则出卖自己民族，成为民族的叛徒。在不同时期，资产阶级民族问题纲领具有不同色彩，其根源就在于为资产阶级具体的不同的阶级利益服务。无产阶级在被压迫民族中要坚决反对帝国主义的压迫，在压迫别人的民族中要坚决反对本国的帝国主义者，在革命已经胜利的民族中则要马上取消对国内及国外一切民族的压迫。在不同时期，无产阶级民族问题的纲领具有不同的色彩，其根源就在于为无产阶级（同时也是为全人类）具体的不同的利益服务。全文例子很多，细看自明。以美国资产阶级为例，一七七六年美国因受英国的压迫，资产阶级为了自己的阶级利益便提出“民族主义”，与人民一起进行反抗英国压迫的斗争。但在其胜利以后，到了能压迫其他民族的时期，资产阶级却提出“美国人是世界上最优秀的种族”的论调，欺骗国内人民，进行对其他民族的侵略了，如在第二次世界大战后他们之援助中国的蒋介石反动统治，侵略中国，制造菲律宾的傀儡政府，武装镇压希腊的人民革命等等。
    三、帝国主义国家的资产阶级往往以金钱或地位，诱买工人阶级中的上层分子，把他们变成工人贵族，来缓和与分裂其国内人民对他的反对，西欧许多国家中社会民主党及其工会的某些上层分子，就是资产阶级所收买的走狗。例如英国职工大会主席工贼劳瑟，受资产阶级收买后，最近便策动该工会常委会通过了要求进步的世界职工联盟停止活动，否则该会即退出世界工联的决议，企图破坏工人运动。这决议已遭到广大工人群众的反对。
    四、美国独立战争，是一七七六年美国资产阶级与人民一起反抗英国奴役的战争。美国南北战争是在一八六一年。当时美国南方各州实行黑奴劳动及各州分权的制度，而北方各州工业发达，没有使用黑奴；因此，北美资产阶级在商业竞争上颇感其苦，于是爆发了南北战争。北方胜利，黑奴获得解放。法国大革命为一七八九年法国资产阶级为了摆脱封建的束缚，领导人民推翻了封建制度。意大利统一运动为一八五九年意大利资产阶级动员人民反对奥国在北意的统治。因为这些战争发生在资本主义的初期，当时工人阶级力量很薄弱，故都为资产阶级所领导，结果便为他们夺取了胜利的果实。但因他们都是反对外国民族或国内封建势力的统治，在一定的历史意义上，是有进步性的。
