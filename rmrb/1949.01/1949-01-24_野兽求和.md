    Act One: Colluding in Wickedness

    (Gongs and drums, Uncle Sam enters)
    Uncle Sam: (Singing Tune One)
    In the world, my wealth is the greatest, gold and silver build pagodas, forcing workers to work harder, the goods shipped out every day pile up like mountains.
    Piling up like mountains, but no one buys them, must invade the whole world, China is a good market, with many people and wide sales.
    China is a really good place, producing grains and cotton, the underground treasures are countless, thinking about it keeps me up all night.
    Japan collapsed, now it’s my turn, why did the Communist Party emerge? It really pisses me off, making me truly helpless!
    Fortunately, there is a son, Chiang Kai-shek, who is my good slave, I give him guns and cannons, give him money, let him go and fight the Communist Party.

    (Beast enters, singing Tune One)
    Beast: (Singing) Having power and influence is like a celestial being, killing people like hemp and occupying the country, ruling China for twenty years, the chairman is really happy.
    The Chinese territory is mine, how can there be national independence, everyone should bow their heads to me, how can there be democracy and freedom!
    It is hateful that Mao Zedong emerged, leading the people to turn over, I’ll give him a taste of my power, see if he dares to struggle again.
    Good daddy has a high nose, gives me foreign money and gives me cannons. (Beast walks towards Uncle Sam and bows)
    Beast: (Singing to Uncle Sam) May I ask if daddy is in good health?
    Uncle Sam: (Singing to Beast) Is my son well?
    Beast: (Singing) The body grows quite nicely, but the heart is too troubled.
    Uncle Sam: (Singing) Son (you) are troubled by what?
    Beast: (Singing) It’s just that the legs are unsteady, always feeling like the earth is shaking and the sky is about to collapse, sitting and sleeping makes my heart panic.
    Uncle Sam: You have a soft bone disease, no reliance, no support, no opinion, pity my son is too lonely, all emperors are the same.
    Beast: There are many soldiers and generals, more than three and a half times more than Zhu De, everything is prepared except one thing, no money, no guns. (Kneels and kowtows)
    Uncle Sam: (Deliberately) Wanting money and guns is not simple, daddy struggles hard and it’s exhausting, without guarantee, I cannot give them, I won’t take care of this matter. (Singing stops)

    (After singing, Beast stands up, aside)
    Beast: Alas! I call him daddy, call myself son, bow, and kowtow to him, but he still doesn't give me guns and cannons, truly ruthless! Seeing that he is asking me for something, fine, in order to be a puppet emperor, one cannot buy goods without investing capital, I’ll go and ask him what he wants.
    Beast: (To Uncle Sam) I say, daddy, what are you asking me for! Should I give Song Meiling to you, but I only have this one!
    Uncle Sam: Bah, who wants your smelly wife!
    Beast: (Aside) Huh! It’s not, let me think, got it! (To Uncle Sam) You don't want my gold, you don't want my silver, you just want to turn China into a barracks, to make it a colony now, and to use it to oppose the Soviet Union in the future. You don't want my east, you don't want my west, you just want a good piece of Chinese land, saying that it produces grains, it has five grains, saying that it produces livestock, it has cattle, sheep, mules, horses, and donkeys, coal and iron ore are available, I’ll sell them all to you: let your planes fly in the sky, let your big American soldiers rampage on the ground, I won't stop you, let the boats travel in the river as you please, let your Americans move around in the city.
    Uncle Sam: (Laughs loudly, pats Beast on the shoulder) Haha… Good son, good son, good son!
    Beast: Are you happy now! But there is one thing, will you guarantee me sitting on the throne or not?
    Uncle Sam: Guarantee you, guarantee you!
    Beast: Guarantee me for how long?
    Uncle Sam: Guarantee you, sit for a lifetime.
    Beast: Ha…, I, Old Chiang, as a person, only seek wealth and glory, I'm not afraid of being infamous for ten thousand years, I don’t care about so many future generations? I don’t care about your rumors and cold words. Good, this is settled, give them to me!
    Uncle Sam: You kneel down. (Beast kneels before Uncle Sam)
    Uncle Sam: Open your mouth. (Beast opens his mouth)
    Uncle Sam: (Singing Tune One) My son is really good, daddy will give you medicine when you are sick, raise your head (you) and take a look, what is this thing? (Takes out a model airplane)
    Beast: (Laughs) Haha… Airplane, (Uncle Sam puts the airplane into the Beast’s mouth, Beast chews and makes strange faces) Good, good!
    Uncle Sam: Eating this is not enough, eat some more elixir, what is this thing? Raise your head and take a look.
    Beast: (Laughs) Ha… Cannon (Uncle Sam puts the cannon into the Beast’s mouth, Beast chews and makes strange faces) Good, good.
    Uncle Sam: My American foreign money is countless, giving you a little is nothing, as long as you fight well, eliminating the Communist Party is good.

    (Uncle Sam throws money into the Beast’s mouth, the Beast eats, the more he throws, the faster he eats)
    Beast: (Stands up, singing Tune One) My daddy is a celestial being, his magic medicine is better than opium, eating it makes my whole body feel good, with strength and energy my body recovers.
    Walking faster and faster, with more and more strength, I am not afraid of any people, with many soldiers and generals, and Japan to protect my carriage.
    Communist Party, what do you amount to? Eight years of resistance is enough to drag you down, guerrilla warfare is useless, comparing people and guns, I have more than you.
    I will defeat you in six months, (turns to the masses) and let the people eat shit! (Makes fierce movements and quickly exits)
    Uncle Sam: (Singing while exiting) Dragon fighting tiger is really fun, (singing while exiting), I'll just stand aside and watch, (turns his head to the masses) It would be fun if millions of Chinese died! (Makes a vicious gesture and quickly exits, gongs and drums play intensely, end of Act One)

    Act Two: Defeated and Fleeing

    (Hero enters, singing Tune Two)
    Hero: Rolling water, flows eastward; washing away thousands of years of grievances and hatred. The power of the people is like a tide, surging and fighting for freedom. (The last two lines are sung together by the Yangko team, same below) Planting lotus seeds, blooming lotus flowers, planting beans gets beans, planting melons gets melons, eight years of resistance war has great merit, victory is formed into a glorious flower.
    The flower of victory, everyone loves it, shining brightly for thousands of years, unite to defend it, not allowing counter-revolutionaries to destroy it.
    Striving for democracy, striving for peace, an independent China is like a new spring, the flowers of liberation bloom in thousands, each flower competing for prosperity. (The last sentence's tone becomes higher, same below) (Hero makes actions of cutting wheat, mining, and other construction movements)

    (Beast, Running Dog follows)
    Beast: Go, go, (points to Hero) Ha, here, found him!
    Beast: (To Hero) Just wanted to find you, you are here.
    Hero: What do you want me for?
    Beast: Nothing else, this matter, is not big! It’s just that I want you to retreat these thousands of miles, to drink the north wind in the desert.
    Running Dog: That's right! Our chairman’s words have been spoken, there is nothing difficult for you, or go back to your snowy mountains and grasslands to eat grass.
    Hero: What kind of reasoning is this, I just drove away the Japanese, I need to tighten the construction of the new society.
    Beast: What construction are you doing?
    Hero: We want to build a new country of independence, democracy, unity, and peace, to turn China from an agricultural country into an industrial country.
    Beast: I don't understand these words.
    Running Dog: What independence! What peace! I've never even heard of it.
    Hero: Ha! This is called casting pearls before swine, then don't bother me!
    Beast: Oh! It's me disturbing you, you're making me unable to sleep.
    Hero: You're so unreasonable.
    Beast: Reasoning! In this era, whoever has power has reason, will you retreat or not?
    Hero: Won’t retreat!
    Beast: Good fellow, you wait and see! (To Running Dog) Buddy, chase him away, this China is not for him.
    Running Dog: Go, go, (runs up to push Hero, Hero doesn't move, Running Dog is knocked to the ground instead.)
    Running Dog: Oh! This won’t work.
    Beast: It won’t work, let’s do it together, (gongs and drums sound, Beast and Running Dog simultaneously punch at Hero, Hero retreats a few steps slightly, catches Running Dog’s fist with his hand, twists his hand, and with one blow, Running Dog falls to the ground.)
    Beast: (Laughs loudly) Ha… Good, buddy, he retreated a few steps!
    Running Dog: (Climbs up) Ouch! (Left hand bent, right hand supporting it and shaking.) Bad, my arm bone is broken.
    Beast: Buddy, it doesn't matter, we've won, we've occupied a lot of territory, we've only fought for half a year!
    Running Dog: We’ve also lost a lot of soldiers, an average of eight brigades being eliminated each month.
    Beast: What does that count for, soldiers can be caught again after they die, what's important for us is to occupy the country. (Turns his head and speaks to himself) Now I can be emperor, I have to put on this hat. (Takes out a paper-pasted emperor's crown and puts it on.)
    Running Dog: Chairman, what are you doing?
    Beast: You can't call me chairman anymore!
    Running Dog: What should I call you?
    Beast: Must call me President.
    Running Dog: What, a steamer? (Points to the Beast’s hat) Look at you wearing a dragon's head!
    Beast: No, it's President.
    Running Dog: Oh! We have steamers, buckets, carrying buckets, chamber pots, but I've never heard of a steam bucket.
    Beast: It's President.
    Running Dog: What's that name for?
    Beast: This is the new term for modern emperors.
    Running Dog: Okay! Let’s call you President! I say: President, what's the plan now? We don't have enough soldiers to exchange!
    Beast: There are plenty of ways, we'll adopt key offensives, you go west and attack his Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, I'll go east and attack his Shandong, let's take these two places first.
    Running Dog: What's that called?
    Beast: It's called key offensives.
    Running Dog: And what was it at the beginning?
    Beast: At the beginning it was called a comprehensive offensive.
    Running Dog: Good, good, our method has changed! The comprehensive offensive has been changed to a key offensive. Offensives are still offensives, it's just that the momentum is smaller! Come on! (Gongs and drums sound, Running Dog and Beast charge towards Hero from the east and west respectively, fighting each other, performing martial arts skills, at the climax, Hero advances, punching with both hands, Running Dog and Beast retreat and fall to the ground at the same time, Hero returns to his original position.)
    (Running Dog and Beast climb up, making a sorry state.)
    Running Dog: Ouch! I say, President, you just didn't pick a good name, it hit me with swelling and pain all over my body, really became a "swelling pain."
    (At this time, Hero prepares to counterattack, Beast panics.)
    Beast: It doesn’t matter, buddy, let's do it again!
    Running Dog: How are we going to do it this time?
    Beast: This time, a comprehensive defense.
    Running Dog: No more offense?
    Beast: Defense is also a kind of offense, buddy, come quickly! People are going to attack us.
    Running Dog: Good, let's do it, (Beast and Running Dog both open their hands in a defensive posture.)
    Hero: (Singing Tune Two) In front there is a tiger, behind there is a wolf, driving away the Japanese, here comes the bad egg, America, Chiang Kai-shek, mindlessly selling out the country as a traitor.
    Not afraid of tigers, not afraid of wolves, no matter how many tigers and wolves there are, we can resist, the people have the Communist Party, the bright light illuminates the way, the heart is not disturbed.
    Don't be afraid of Chiang's bandit troops, eliminate one less one, no matter how many there are, we can eat them all, this method is most correct.
    His (decrease), my (increase), in engineering and artillery, he can’t beat me. In the second year, the war situation changed, the Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River.
    (Gongs and drums sound, Hero waves his sickle and axe to attack, Beast and Running Dog retreat in embarrassment, Hero fights with Beast and Running Dog, knocking them down.)
    (Running Dog helps Beast up)
    Running Dog: Ouch! President, what's wrong with you?
    Beast: Ouch! My back hurts! (Makes an ugly gesture of twisting his waist) Go.
    Running Dog: Ouch! This is useless.
    Beast: Don't be afraid, I have one last trick.
    Running Dog: What trick?
    Beast: This is called key defense, let's defend the isolated city!
    Running Dog: Defense also has tricks, the comprehensive defense can't hold, good, come on!
    (Beast stands behind Running Dog, grabs Running Dog's waist with both hands, head close to Running Dog's back, making a hiding gesture.)
    Running Dog: This won’t work.
    Beast: Why?
    Running Dog: You stand in front, let me be in the back, I'm scared!
    Beast: No, I'm the president, you have to obey my orders. Quick, here they come!
    (Gongs and drums sound, Hero fights again, Beast uses Running Dog as a shield, hiding east and west, Hero cuts off the top of his hat with one knife, and strikes Running Dog's head with one axe, both fall to the ground, beaten to a pulp, embarrassed to leave the scene.)
    Hero: (Singing Tune Two) The sunlight, red and red, snow-made people are useless. The people's light is thousands of feet, big ghosts and small ghosts all dissolve.
    His (decrease), my (increase), three million troops strengthen the mountains and rivers, in the third year there is a new change, the number of Liberation Army soldiers increases.
    Say attack east, east opens; say attack west, west is occupied. Surrounding hundreds of thousands of enemies, eliminating them all in three to five days.
    Waiting for the stars, waiting for the moon, about a year, Old Chiang will be defeated, the light of victory is in sight, this year we will definitely cross the Yangtze River.
    (Hero waves his knife and runs wildly, quickly exits, end of Act Two.)

    Act Three: Conspiracies and Deceits

    (Running Dog enters in embarrassment, singing Tune One, rubbing his feet with his hands while singing, Beast follows)
    Running Dog: Lifting a stone and hitting my own foot, ouch ouch ouch alas alas ouch, I only blame myself for being born into the wrong life in the previous life, (points to Beast) following him, this unlucky goods.
    Beast: Don't be pessimistic (you) don't be sad, I, surnamed Chiang, have many methods, failure is my daily fare, luck will come eventually.
    Running Dog: Knowing when you'll get lucky, I only blame myself for following you, the Northeast and North China were completely lost, and Central China (also) only has a little bit of land left.
    Beast: Seeing that the whole country is about to be lost, there is no other way to think, I have to find my foreign daddy to help a little bit, (to the inside) Daddy, daddy, please come and help.
    (Uncle Sam enters)
    Uncle Sam: What does my son want me for? I have many things to do at home, economic panic, unable to sell goods, workers strike, troubling me.
    Beast: Your situation is much better than mine, no matter how bad, you still have a nest. The Liberation Army is chasing me tight, it looks like I'm about to have no place to hide.
    Running Dog: Your wealth is the greatest in the world, lend me three hundred million to spend.
    Uncle Sam: Mentioning money makes me worry, the Yellow River's water has an end, you are a bottomless pit, giving you more is not enough.
    Beast: Right now, I don't have any soldiers, only a hundred thousand left alone, please just come yourself, American foreigners are guaranteed to do it. (Singing stops)
    Uncle Sam: (White) Oh, wanting money, wanting soldiers, it would be good, but unfortunately, daddy can't take them out.
    Beast: We are fighting for you! If you don't send troops yourself, you must send a general.
    Uncle Sam: That's not possible either, I want to send troops and generals in my heart, but unfortunately, I can't take care of myself!
    Beast: Then you just don't care about us!
    Uncle Sam: How can I not care, as the saying goes, father and son don't separate, I am concerned every day!
    Running Dog: What are you going to do?
    Uncle Sam: I'm going to have him (points to Beast) step down.
    Beast: Oh! (Singing Tune One) Hearing his words (my) heart is troubled, I treat him (to Uncle Sam) not badly, look at what words you are saying, why are you asking me to step down?
    Uncle Sam: (Singing) Hook-nosed people have many thoughts, this trick is really good, hurry and negotiate with him, and can still save half of the country! Send a few good slaves, infiltrate the revolution as opposition, tell them to work more harmoniously in the future, heal their wounds and then come back. (Singing stops)
    Beast: (White) What are you saying!
    Uncle Sam: I said… (Whispers in Beast's ear)
    Beast: (Nods) This is not bad, you still want me
    Uncle Sam: Of course, I want you.
    Beast: Just asking me to avoid for a while?
    Uncle Sam: Yes, come back in a few years.
    Beast: You still want to fight?
    Uncle Sam: Of course, I want to fight.
    Beast: Just temporarily making a peaceful appearance.
    Uncle Sam: Yes, peace for a few days!
    Beast: Waiting for us to eat our fill, heal our wounds, have enough energy, have enough strength…
    Uncle Sam: Yes, waiting for you to grow back like you should be!
    Beast: Then, by golly, swoop over and kill them.
    Uncle Sam: Yes, what do you think?
    Beast: It's good, but I'm afraid the Communist Party won't do it.
    Running Dog: The Communist Party is sure not to do it, what time is it, hoeing the seedlings to the end, squeezing the cake to get the oil, who would be willing to give up halfway?
    Uncle Sam: We will ask him to do it.
    Running Dog: How will we ask him?
    Uncle Sam: Hey, do it like this (gives Running Dog a mask to wear, the mask has the words "I Want Peace"). You just say that you have always wanted peace, you go and mess around with them for a few sentences, and they will be willing to be harmonious!
    Beast: Yes, good is good, but is this method effective?
    Uncle Sam: Good, let's practice for a while and you'll know. (Running Dog puts on the mask)
    Running Dog: I am like the Liberation Army, come on!
    Beast: (Singing Tune One) People always have to be good-hearted, why should two brothers fight, we are all Chinese, let’s see if we can reconcile. (Walks to Running Dog and kneels) (Singing Tune One) Red lilies bloom all over, two brothers don't separate, it would be nice to be harmonious, it’s okay for me to step down.
    Running Dog (Singing Tune One) If you don't fight, I won't fight, we are originally one family, harmonious and good for each other, China will be peaceful from now on!
    Uncle Sam: You just rest your injuries, heal your illness, train your soldiers well, feed your horses strong, suddenly pounce on them.
    Beast: Yes, give me some more food.
    Uncle Sam: (Throws food into Beast’s mouth again) Eat!
    Beast: (Wolf-like eating, waving his fist) Strength is coming, strength is coming.
    Uncle Sam: Ha... How about your father's plan?
    Beast: Ha… That's right! The plan is too good!
    Running Dog: Yes, it's right, but I have to pretend!
    Beast: That's nothing, when I defeat the Communist Party, I'll let you be the vice president.
    Running Dog: (Hearing this, he is happy) Yes, let's do it!
    Uncle Sam: Yes, go and do it quickly! But don't say it's my idea.
    Beast
    Running Dog: Of course, let's go. (The three exit together, end of Act Three)

    Act Four: Revolution to the End

    (Hero enters, singing Tune Two)
    Hero: The Chinese people have many sufferings, tortured for thousands of years, waving knives to cut off the old shackles, loudly singing a song of victory.
    Victory, not easy, obtained by decades of struggle, how many martyrs shed blood, how many people contributed.
    Cutting grass, to remove roots, building a new house to put a roof on it, stopping work halfway, is like digging a well without water.
    The army, advances forward, the rear produces an inch longer, everyone strengthens discipline, China's revolution will be invincible.

    (White) The people’s revolutionary war has been going on for two and a half years, fighting Chiang's bandits so that they only have breath and no intake. They are about to die! It makes people happy, let me sort out my weapons and prepare to cross the Yangtze River.

    (Beast enters)
    Beast: (Singing Tune One)
    I won't bow my head until I'm about to die, Old Chiang's clever plan is hidden in my heart, pretending to be pitiful, I'll go and ask for peace.
    (White) This time, it’s guaranteed to succeed, look at what he's doing there, let me go ask for peace! (Walks towards Hero) (Singing) A good thing I'll tell you, peaceful thoughts are in my heart, we are all Chinese, fighting back and forth is really unnecessary.
    It's good for you and it's good for me, put down our weapons and talk about peace! My Old Chiang has no ghosts in my heart, just for everyone's good.
    (Hero ignores)
    Beast: What's wrong! He ignores me, let me kneel down and beg.
    (Beast walks to Hero and kneels to beg for peace, Hero turns his back on him, staring with both eyes.)
    Beast: Oh, I beg you, let's make peace, aren’t you the most peace-loving?
    Hero: (Still ignoring, speaks to himself) I remembered a story, this is a story of a good old man. (Makes a thinking gesture, old man enters, Hero’s eyes always staring at the old man, so that the masses understand that this is the old man in his thoughts. If it is performed on stage, another external curtain can be used.)
    Old Man: (Clapper talk) I, old man, sixty-three, I am the most kind-hearted person, believe in gods, believe in Buddha, talk about charity, eat vegetarian food, don’t harm living beings, don't cultivate blessings in this life, only cultivate paradise in the next life, go, go, I, old man, kind heart, famous in the world, no match.
    Old Man: It's so cold today, let me go out to the market to buy some New Year goods to celebrate the New Year, go.
    Ah! There's a rope on the road, let me pick it up, (bends down and looks carefully) no, it's a long worm. (Picks it up) Oh, the weather is too cold, come, little long worm, so pitiful! Why isn't it moving, ha, it's too cold, it's frozen stiff, let me warm it up. (Unties his clothes and puts the long worm in front of his chest to warm it, watching carefully.)
    It's also a life! So pitiful! Okay, I see the tail moving, good, it can crawl. Poor child, you were frozen stiff, I warmed you for a while, you know? Don't crawl, you're sticking out your tongue, what are you doing! (Old man suddenly yells)
    Oh, why are you biting me! (Covers his chest with his hand, making a painful gesture.)
    Oh, I was bitten by the long worm! Oh, it hurts so much, I'm panicking in my heart. (Gradually retreats, to the stage entrance)
    Oh, dizzy, I can't live! You evil thing, you are ungrateful, I saved you, and you bit me. I can only blame myself, I pity evil people, I should receive this evil retribution. Oh! (Falls to the backstage, Hero watches the old man exit, turns around, making a sense-making gesture.)
    Hero: The poor good old man, his will is right, “I pity evil people, I should receive evil retribution!” Right!
    (Singing Tune Two) The dog wags its tail, has no good intentions, tigers and wolves are born wanting to eat people, the reactionaries' sinister conspiracy, the Chinese people see clearly.
    In ancient times, there was a Greek farmer, who wholeheartedly wanted to save a long worm, but was bitten by the long worm, I remember this story clearly.
    If Chiang Kai-shek is not overthrown, China will never have peace, the dawn of victory is in sight, revolution to the end is most important.
    Beast: Oh, I'm sincerely doing this, what a pity that you can't see my heart, you should ask others to see.
    (Running Dog enters with a mask, but still shows his tail)
    Running Dog: (Singing Tune One) Nothing was going on, I was sitting in the room, I heard that Old Chiang wants to talk about peace, (to Hero) this opportunity is really good, this time I can be the president.
    (White) Chiang Kai-shek stepped down, my American master fulfilled me. I have to put on a "peaceful" appearance so that Chiang Kai-shek can recover from his injuries.
    (Running Dog kneels to beg for peace)
    Hero: We must carry the revolution to the end. Liberate the whole of China, if we still let the reactionary forces exist, with America helping him, then one day, we will have to fight again.
    Running Dog: This………this………I say, aren’t you the most peace-loving? Why are you now believing in force!
    Hero: Why don’t I talk about peace, in the past for the sake of peace, the people were so generous to you! But he thought the people were easy to bully, now that you are dying, you pretend to be pitiful, this is deception!
    Beast: I dare not deceive, I beg you to make peace! I’m also doing it for everyone's public will.
    Hero: Hmph! Fart! It wouldn't take much effort to eliminate you. Good! In order to achieve peace as soon as possible, if you want peace, you have to have real peace.
    Beast: Good, good, then you retreat a few dozen miles first, and let me relax a little.
    Hero: Your trick can’t fool a three-year-old child.
    Running Dog: Good, good, tell us what your peace is!
    Hero: Real peace? Unless it is oh……… (Starts singing)
    Hero: (Singing Tune) If you want to reconcile, we can reconcile, there are eight conditions for peace. War criminals must be punished, only when there are no robbers can we reconcile.
    Beast: Oh, to punish me? Then am I negotiating to find punishment! This cannot be done.
    Hero: (Singing) Abolish the false constitution, abolish the false legal system, the reactionary army must be reorganized, bureaucratic capital must be confiscated, and land reform must be implemented.
    Beast: That can’t be done, my money is gone, my soldiers are gone, am I negotiating to find this?
    Running Dog: Ah! Your conditions are too high!
    Hero: China! To be independent! Abolish the treasonous treaties, convene a new People’s Political Consultative Conference, don't let the reactionaries attend.
    Beast: (Stands up) Oh, I finally found an unlucky thing, I knelt for half a day in vain, I still have to fight, good, I'll first hand over the president's hat to Running Dog to wear, I'll hide behind and direct the fight. (Gives the president's hat to Running Dog and retreats to the background)
    Running Dog: I say, your conditions are too high, not to mention that he can’t accept them, I think they are too thorough, they should be milder.
    Hero: This is the public will of the people. (To the masses) Folks, do we want to punish war criminals?
    Masses: Yes!
    Hero: Do we want to take over the reactionary regime?
    Masses: Yes!
    Hero: Do we want to confiscate bureaucratic capital and implement land reform throughout the country?
    Masses: Yes! Confiscate bureaucratic capital and implement land reform throughout the country!
    Hero: What about the treasonous treaties?
    Masses: Resolutely abolish them!
    Hero: What about the reactionary army?
    Masses: Thoroughly reorganize it!
    Hero: What if they resist?
    Masses: Thoroughly eliminate them!
    Hero: Yes! (To Running Dog) Listen, what are they saying?
    Running Dog: (Speaking to himself) Chiang Kai-shek wants me to be the acting president, so that he can recover from his injuries in the back, now they have seen through it.
    Hero: Hmph! What are you here for?
    Running Dog: (Panicked) I'm also here to talk about peace!
    Hero: Bullshit! Your tail is showing!
    Running Dog: (Touching his tail) Ah! Bad, bad!
    Hero: Please everyone, take a look at the faces of these bandits, (knocks off Running Dog’s presidential hat, pulls off Running Dog’s tail, opens the curtain, Beast is practicing martial arts with teeth and claws, Uncle Sam is watching next to him, when he sees Hero opening the curtain, everyone is in chaos, the masses swarm up, shouting to hit, shouting slogans.)
    Beast: Oh!
    (The three climb up, the masses swarm up, grab the three, shouting slogans.)

    第一场：狼狈为奸
    （锣鼓过门，山姆上）
    山姆：（唱曲一）
    世上数我钱财大，金子银子盖宝塔，逼着工人加油干，每天出货堆成山。
    堆成山来没人买，一定要侵略全世界，中国是一个好市场，人又多，销路广。
    中国地方真不错，五谷棉花出产多，地下的宝藏数不尽，想的我整夜睡不着。
    日本垮了就该我来，为何出了个共产党？真他妈的恼我的火，闹的我实在没奈何！
    幸好有个儿子蒋介石，倒是咱的好奴才，我给他枪炮给他钱，让他去打共产党。
    （野兽上，唱曲一）
    野兽：（唱）有权有势似神仙，杀人如麻占江山，统治中国二十年，委员长真个当的欢。
    中国地盘是我的，哪来什么民族独立，人人都该对我低低头，哪来什么民主自由！
    可恨出了个毛泽东，领导人民去翻身，让我给他一个利害，看他敢不敢再斗争。
    好爸爸有个高鼻子，又给我洋钱又给我炮。（野兽走向山姆鞠躬）
    野兽：（对山姆唱）请问爸爸身体可好？
    山姆：（对野兽唱）我的儿子好不好？
    野兽：（唱）身体长的倒象个样，就是心中太烦恼。
    山姆：（唱）儿子（你）烦恼些什么事？
    野兽：（唱）就是两腿站不稳，总象地动天要翻，坐着睡着心发慌。
    山姆：你得的是个软骨病，没依没靠没主张，可怜我儿太孤单，从来帝王都一般。
    野兽：兵也多来将也广，要比朱德多三倍半，万事都备缺一样，没有钱来没有枪。（跪下叩头）
    山姆：（故意）要钱要枪不简单，爸爸苦挣也费艰，没有保障可不能给，这个事情我不管。（唱止）
    （对唱毕，野兽立起，旁白）
    野兽：唉呀！我对他又是叫爸爸，又是称儿子，又是鞠躬，又是磕头，可是他还不给我枪炮，真也算是利害！看着他是问我要东西啦，也罢，为了当个儿皇帝，不出本钱买不来货，待我去问他要什么来。
    野兽：（对山姆）我说，爸爸，你是问我要什么呀！叫我把宋美龄送给你吧，可我只有这一个呀！
    山姆：呸，谁要你那个臭老婆！
    野兽：（旁白）呵！不是，待我来想想，有了！（对山姆）你是要我给点法币给你，给吧，给！（换出一把法币）
    山姆：呸，你那个法币值的个啥，比一张冥纸都不如，擦屁股还嫌这票子太硬。（以手挥开）
    野兽：呵，又不是！不要我留着自己呵，化装上法币）呵，有了，（快板）你是不要我的金来不要我的银，单要把中国当作兵营，看眼前好作殖民地，看将来反苏也能行。你是不要我的东来不要我的西，单要我中国一片好地皮，说产粮食他有五谷，说产牲口他有牛、羊、骡子、马和驴，煤铁矿产样样有，我一下全都卖给你：天空让你的飞机转，地下让你兵大爷横冲直闯我不挡你，河里行船随你的意，城里转动你美国的。
    山姆：（大笑，以手拍野兽肩）哈哈……好儿子，好儿子，好儿子！
    野兽：你高兴了吧！只是有一件，你保我坐江山不保？
    山姆：保你，保你！
    野兽：保我多久？
    山姆：保你，坐一辈子。
    野兽：哈……，我老蒋为人，但求一身富贵，不怕遗臭万年，那管得那许多后辈子孙？那管得你风言冷语。好，这就算话了，你给我吧！
    山姆：你跪下来。（野兽跪山姆前）
    山姆：张开口来（野兽张开口）
    山姆：（唱曲一）我的儿子真不错，病了爸爸给你吃药，抬起头来（你）看一看，这个东西是什么？（拿出一面做飞机）
    野兽：（笑）哈哈……飞机，（山姆将飞机投入兽嘴，兽咀嚼作怪状）好，好！
    山姆：吃了这个还不算，再吃一点灵保丹，这个东西是什么？抬起头来看一看。
    野兽：（笑）哈……大炮（山姆将大炮投入兽嘴，兽咀嚼作怪状）好，好。
    山姆：数我美国的洋钱多，给你一点不算什么，只要你好好去打仗，消灭共产党就不错。
    （山姆以钱投兽嘴，兽吃，越投越多，越吃越快）
    野兽：（站起来唱曲一）我的爸爸是神仙，他的妙药，赛过大烟，吃了一身都痛快，有力有劲身体都复元。
    越走越快越劲大，那一个人民我都不怕，兵又多来将又广，还有日本保我的驾。
    共产党来你算什么？八年抗战够你拖，游击队来不顶用，比人比枪我比你多。
    要我打你六个月，（反转对群众）叫你人民吃个球！（作凶恶动作急下）
    山姆：（边唱边下）龙争虎斗真好玩，（边唱边下），我且站在旁边只管看，（回头对群众）中国人死球他几百万才好玩！（作狠毒状急下，锣鼓紧奏，第一场完）
    第二场：大败而逃
    （壮士上，唱曲二）
    壮士：滚滚水，向东流；洗净千年冤和仇。人民的力量象潮水，汹涌澎湃争自由。（后两句秧歌队员同唱，下同）种莲子，开荷花，种豆得豆，种瓜得瓜，八年抗战功劳大，胜利结成光荣花。
    胜利花，人人爱，千秋万世放光彩，团结起来保卫他，不容反革命来破坏。
    争民主，争和平，独立中国赛新春，解放鲜花开万朵，鲜花朵朵竞繁荣（最后一句音调转高，下同）（壮士作割麦，开矿等建设动作）
    （野兽、走狗随上）
    野兽：走，走，（指壮士）哈，在这里，找着啦！
    野兽：（对壮士）正要找你，你就在这里。
    壮士：找我干什么？
    野兽：没有别的事，这个事吧，也不大！就是要你退这么几千里，到沙漠里喝北风去。
    走狗：对着啦！我们的委员长话是说出来了，也没有什么难为你的，还是回你的雪山草地吃草去。
    壮士：你这是什么道理，我刚打走了日本，要紧着建设新社会。
    野兽：你建设什么？
    壮士：我们要建设一个独立、民主、统一、和平的新国家，要把中国由农业国变成工业国。
    野兽：你这些话，我不懂。
    走狗：什么独立呀！和平呀！我压根儿没听见过。
    壮士：哈！这叫做对牛弹琴，那你就别打扰我啦！
    野兽：哎呀！倒是我打扰了你，你害的我睡不着觉。
    壮士：你多不讲理。
    野兽：讲理！这年头谁有势力谁就有理，你倒底退不退？
    壮士：不退！
    野兽：好家伙，你等着瞧吧！（对走狗）伙计，撵他走，咱这个中国没他的份儿。
    走狗：走，走，（跑上去推壮士，壮士不动，走狗反而被碰倒地。）
    走狗：（爬起）唉呀！不行。
    野兽：不行，咱两个人来，（锣鼓声响，野兽与走狗同时挥拳向壮士进击，壮士略退几步，以手接住走狗拳，扭过手来，一击，走狗扑倒地下。）
    野兽：（大笑）哈……好了，伙计，他退了几步啦！
    走狗：（爬起）唉哟！（左手弯着，右手扶之摇动。）坏了，我的臂骨打断了。
    野兽：伙计，不要紧，咱们胜利了，占着的地盘不少了，才打了半年仗！
    走狗：我们死的兵马可也不少，每个月被消灭平均八个旅。
    野兽：这算什么，兵死了再抓，我们要紧的是占江山。（回头自语）现在我可以做皇帝了，我得把这个帽子戴起来。（拿出一纸糊帝王冠戴起。）
    走狗：委员长，你这是干什么来啦？
    野兽：以后你可不敢再叫我委员长了！
    走狗：得叫什么？
    野兽：得叫总统。
    走狗：什么，蒸笼吗？（指野兽帽）看你戴上个龙头呵！
    野兽：不是，是总统。
    走狗：唉呀！咱们有蒸笼，有水桶，提桶，马桶，就没听见过蒸桶。
    野兽：就是总统。
    走狗：这名字儿干什么来着。
    野兽：这就是现代皇帝的新名词儿。
    走狗：好吧！咱就叫总统吧！我说：总统，现在怎么个干法？咱们的兵马不够使换啦！
    野兽：那有的是办法，咱们采取重点进攻，你走西边打他的陕北，我走东边打他的山东，咱们先拿下这两个地方再说。
    走狗：这叫什么？
    野兽：这叫重点进攻。
    走狗：那起先呢？
    野兽：起先叫全面进攻。
    走狗：好，好，咱们的法儿是改啦！全面进攻改为重点进攻了。进攻倒是进攻，就是势儿小多啦！来吧！（锣鼓声响，走狗与野兽从东西两方分别冲向壮士，彼此大战，表演武技，至精彩处，壮士前进，以两手挥拳，走狗野兽同时后退倒地，壮士回到原来地位。）
    （走狗野兽爬起，作狼狈状。）
    走狗：哎呀！我说总统，你这个名字就是没有起好，打的我浑身又肿又痛，真的成了个“肿痛”了。
    （这时壮士作准备反击状，野兽恐慌。）
    野兽：不要紧，伙计，咱们再来吧！
    走狗：这回怎么个来法？
    野兽：这回全面防御。
    走狗：不进攻了？
    野兽：防御也就是进攻的一种，伙计快来吧！人家要向我们进攻了。
    走狗：好，咱就来，（野兽与走狗两人张开双手作防御状。）
    壮士：（唱曲二）前有虎，后有狼，打走日本来美国这个坏蛋，蒋介石，死心卖国当汉奸。
    不怕虎，不怕狼，虎狼再多能抵挡，人民有了共产党，明灯照路心不慌。
    蒋匪军队不怕（你）多，消灭一个少一个，再多也能吃的完，这个方法最正确。
    他（的）减少，我（的）增多，工兵、炮兵他赛不过我。第二年战局起了变化，解放大军过黄河。
    （锣鼓声响，壮士挥镰刀斧头进攻，野兽走狗狼狈后退，壮士与野兽走狗战斗，将二人击倒。）
    （走狗扶野兽起）
    走狗：唉哟！总统，你怎么啦？
    野兽：唉哟！我腰痛啦！（作扭腰丑态）走
    走狗：唉哟！这不顶球事了。
    野兽：不怕，我还有最后一计。
    走狗：什么计？
    野兽：这叫做重点防御，咱们来守孤城吧！
    走狗：防御也起了花样啦，全面的守不住了，好，来吧！
    （野兽站在走狗后面，以双手抓走狗腰，头紧靠走狗背，作躲藏状。）
    走狗：这个不行。
    野兽：怎么？
    走狗：你站到前面来，让我在后面，我害怕呀！
    野兽：不行，我是总统，你得服从我的命令。快，人家来了！
    （锣鼓声响，壮士又与战斗，野兽以走狗为挡箭牌，东躲西藏，被壮士一刀削去帽顶，一斧击走狗头，二人倒地，打得一败涂地，狼狈下场。）
    壮士：（唱曲二）太阳光，红又红，雪作的人儿不顶用。人民的光芒千万丈，大鬼小鬼全消溶。
    他（的）减少，我（的）增多，三百万大军壮山河，第三年又有新变化，解放军兵马数量多。
    说打东，东就开；说打西来占西方。包围敌人几十万，三天五天消灭个光。
    盼星星，盼月亮，一年左右就能打垮老蒋，胜利曙光就在望，今年一定过长江。
    （壮士挥刀狂奔，迅下，第二场完。）
     第三场：阴谋鬼计
    （走狗狼狈上，唱曲一，唱时以手揉脚，野兽随上）
    走狗：搬起石头打了自己的脚，唉哟唉哟唉唉哟，只怪我前世投错了胎，（指野兽）跟了他这个倒霉货。
    野兽：不要消极（你）不要悲观，我姓蒋的办法多，失败是我的家常饭，运气来了就不错。
    走狗：晓得你那一天走运气，我只怪自己跟了你，东北华北丢了个光，华中（也）只剩下一点儿地。
    野兽：眼看着全国就要丢光，没有别的法儿想，只得去找洋爸爸帮一点忙，（对内）爸爸爸爸你快来帮忙。
    （山姆上）
    山姆：我的儿子叫我干什么？我在家里事情多，经济恐慌卖不出货，工人罢工苦恼着我。
    野兽：你的情况比我好多，再赖你也有一个窝。解放军撵我撵的紧，眼看就要没地方躲。
    走狗：世上数你的钱财大，借那么三十万万给我花。
    山姆：提起钱来我就发愁，黄河流水有尽头，你是一个无底洞，给你再多你也不够。
    野兽：眼下我还没有兵，剩下百把万孤零零，请你干脆自己来，美国洋人保管行，（唱止）
    山姆：（白）唉呀！又要钱，又要兵，好倒是好，可惜为爸爸的拿不出来。
    野兽：我们打仗也是为着你打的呀！你要不自己出兵，总得请你派上一员大将。
    山姆：这也不行，我心里想倒是想派兵遣将，就可惜自己也顾不住呀！
    野兽：那你就干脆不管我们啦！
    山姆：怎么不管，常言道父子不分家，我天天也就关心着啦！
    走狗：你准备怎么着？
    山姆：我准备要他（指野兽）下台。
    野兽：唉呀！（唱曲一）听他言来（我）心中烦恼，好心好意（我）待他不差，看你（对山姆）说的什么话，怎么要我把台下？
    山姆；（唱）钩鼻子人儿心眼多，这一条计策真不错，赶快同他去讲和，还可保下半壁山河！再派他几个好奴才，打入革命作反对派，叫他们以后和气点干，养好了创伤你再来。（唱止）
    野兽：（白）你说的什么啦！
    山姆：我说……（对野兽耳语）
    野兽：（点头）这个倒还不错，你还是要我
    山姆：当然要你。
    野兽：只是叫我躲避一下子？
    山姆：对，过那么几年再来。
    野兽：你还是要打仗？
    山姆：当然要打。
    野兽：只是暂且作一个和平的样子。
    山姆：对，和平那么几天吧！
    野兽：等我们把饭吃饱了，伤养好了，劲儿足了，力气大了……
    山姆：对，等你又长的象个样儿啦！
    野兽：就乖乖龙的冬，这么扑了过去，把他们杀死。
    山姆：对，你看怎么样？
    野兽：好倒是好，就怕共产党不干。
    走狗：共产党保险不干，这是什么时候，锄苗锄到头，榨饼榨出油，那个会愿意半途而废？
    山姆：我们就要叫他干。
    走狗：怎么个叫法？
    山姆：嘿，你这么着（给走狗一个假面戴上，假面上有“我要和平”四字。）你就说自己向来要和平，你去和他们鬼捣几句，管叫他们就愿和着啦！
    野兽：对，好倒是好，可是这办法灵不灵呢？
    山姆：好，咱们演习一下子你就知道了。（走狗戴上假面）
    走狗：我这就好比解放军，你来吧！
    野兽：（唱曲一）为人总要心地好，兄弟两个怎么要打，我们都是中国人，看看还是和了吧（走到走狗前跪下）（唱曲一）山丹丹开花一遍红，兄弟两个不要分，和和气气该多好，要我下台也能行。
    走狗（唱曲一）你不打来我就不打，我们二人原是一家，和和气气两相好，中国从此太平啦！
    山姆：你这就养你的伤，治你的病，把兵练的足足的，马喂的壮壮的，猛不防扑了过去。
    野兽：对，你再给我点吃的。
    山姆：（又以食物投野兽口中）吃吧！
    野兽：（狼餐虎吃挥拳作态）劲来了，劲来了。
    山姆：哈……你看你老子的计策怎么样？
    野兽：哈……对着啦！计策高的太啦！
    走狗：对倒是对，只是得教我装腔作势！
    野兽：那不算什么，等我打垮了共产党，就叫你当副总统。
    走狗：（闻之喜）对，说干就干吧！
    山姆：对，你们快去干吧！可不敢说是我的主意儿。
    野兽
    走狗：那当然，走。（三人同下，第三场完）
    第四场：革命到底
    （壮士上，唱曲二）
    壮士：中国人民，苦难多，几千年来受折磨，挥刀砍断旧枷锁，高声唱个胜利歌。
    胜利呀，不容易，奋斗几十年得来的，多少烈士流过血，多少人民出过力。
    斩草呀，要除根，新修房子要盖顶，干了一半就收工，好比打了个没水井。
    军队呀，向前进，后方生产长一寸，大家加强纪律性，中国的革命无不胜。
    （白）人民革命战争进行了二年半，打的蒋匪只有出气没有进气的。快死啦！真叫人高兴，待我来整理武器，准备打过长江去。
    （野兽上）
    野兽：（唱曲一）
    不到要死不低头，老蒋的妙计藏心头，装出一副可怜相，待我前去把和求。
    （白）这一下呀，保管要成功，你看他正在那儿干什么，让我去求和去呀！（走向壮士）　（唱）好事一件我告诉你，和平思想在我心里，通通都是中国人，打来打去真不必。
    你也好来我也好，放下刀枪讲和好！我老蒋心里没有鬼，就是为的大家好。
    （壮士不理）
    野兽：怎么啦！他就不理，让我来跪下求求。
    （野兽走至壮士前跪下求和，壮士以背对之，双目凝视。）
    野兽：唉呀呀！我求求你，咱们和了吧，你不是最爱和平的么？
    壮士：（仍不理，自语）我想起一个故事来了，这是一个好老汉的故事。（作思索状，老汉上，壮士双目始终凝视老汉，以便使群众了解这是思索中的老汉。如在舞台演出，可另用一外幕。）
    老汉：（快板）我老汉，六十三，为人最是好心肠，信神信佛讲慈善，吃斋吃素不把生伤，不修这辈子眼前福，单修来世上天堂，走，走，我老汉，好心肠，天下闻名没有双。
    老汉：今天这么冷，待我出门去赶集，办点年货回来，好过年呀，走。
    呀！这路上是一根绳子，让我拾起来，（弯腰细看）不是，是一条长虫。（拾起来）呀哟，天气太冷，来，小长虫，多可怜呀！怎么不动，呵，太冷了，把他冻僵了，让我来暖他一暖。（解衣把长虫放在胸前暖和，眼看着。）
    也是一条生命呀！真可怜！好了，看着尾巴动了，好了，能爬了。可怜的小孩，你冻僵了，我给你暖那么一会，你知道吧？不要爬，你把舌头伸出来了，干什么哩！（老汉忽然大叫一声）
    唉呀，你怎么咬我啦？（以手掩胸，作痛状。）
    唉哟，我被长虫咬了呀！唉哟，我好痛，心里发慌。（渐后退，至场口）
    唉哟，头晕，我不能活啦！你这恶东西，你忘恩负义，我把你救活，你倒咬我一口。也只怪我自己，我怜惜恶人，应该受这个恶报。唉哟！（倒向后台，壮士目送老汉下，回转身来，作理会状。）
    壮士：可怜的好老汉，他的遗嘱是对的，“我怜惜恶人，应当得到恶报！”对呀！
    （唱曲二）狗摇尾，没好心，虎狼生性想吃人，反动派的鬼阴谋，中国人民看的清。
    古时候，希腊有个农民，一心想要救活长虫，反被长虫咬一口，这个故事我记的清。
    不打倒蒋介石，中国永远没有和平，胜利曙光在眼前，革命到底最要紧。
    野兽：唉呀呀！我这是真心诚意，可惜你不能看看我的心，你最好问问旁人看。
    （走狗带着假面具上但仍露出尾巴）
    走狗（唱曲一）：无事我正在房中坐，听说老蒋要讲和，（对壮士）这个机会真不错，我这回可把总统做。
    （白）蒋介石下台，我的美国主子成全了我。得装个“和平”样子好教蒋介石养伤。
    （走狗跪下求和）
    壮士：我们一定要把革命进行到底。解放全中国，要是仍让反动势力存在，美国帮助他，那总有一天，又得打起来。
    走狗：这个………这个………我说，你不是最讲和平的么？怎么你现在反而迷信武力来啦！
    壮士：我怎么不讲和平，过去为了和平，人民对你们多宽大！但是他却以为人民好欺侮，现在你们快死了，就装出可怜相来，这是欺骗！
    野兽：我可不敢欺骗，求求你和了吧！我也是为了大家的公意。
    壮士：哼！放你的屁，我要消灭你，也不费什么力气。好！为了早日实现和平，要和，就得有个真正的和平。
    野兽：好好，那你先退这么几十里，也让我松一点劲。
    壮士：你这鬼计哄不了三岁小孩子。
    走狗：好好，你把你的和平说出来听听！
    壮士：真正的和平么？那除非是呵………（起唱）
    壮士：（唱曲）说要和，也能和，和平条件有八个。战犯一定要惩办，没有了强盗才能和。
    野兽：唉呀！要惩办我？那我讲和是为着找惩办来啦！这个可不能行。
    壮士：（唱）废除伪宪法，废除伪法统，反动派军队一定要改编，官僚资本要没收，土地改革要实现。
    野兽：那可不行，我的钱也没啦，兵也没啦，我讲和是找这个来？
    走狗：呀！你这个条件太高了！
    壮士：中国呀！要独立！卖国条约要废弃，召开人民的新政协，不让反动派来出席。
    野兽：（站起来）呵呀！我总算找了个倒霉，白跪了半天，老子还是得打呵，好，我先把总统帽子交给走狗让他戴上，我躲在背后指挥打仗。（将总统帽给走狗退幕后）
    走狗：我说，你这个条件太高，莫说是他不能接受，我看也太彻底了，应该温和一点。
    壮士：这是人民的公意。（对群众）乡亲们，我们要不要惩办战犯？
    群众：要！
    壮士：要不要将反动派的政权都接收过来？
    群众：要！
    壮士：要不要没收官僚资本，在全国实行土地改革？
    群众：对呀！没收官僚资本，在全国实行土地改革！
    壮士：对卖国条约呢？
    群众：坚决废除它！
    壮士：对反动派的军队呢？
    群众：彻底改编它！
    壮士：他要是反抗呢？
    群众：彻底消灭它！
    壮士：对呀！（对走狗）你听听，大家怎么说着来？
    走狗：（自言自语）蒋介石想叫我当代理总统，好教他在后边养伤，现在被他们看穿啦。
    壮士：哼！你是干什么来的？
    走狗：（慌）我也是来讲和的！
    壮士：放你妈的屁！你的尾马露出来了！
    走狗：（摸着自己的尾巴）呀！坏了坏了！
    壮士：请大家看看这般强盗的鬼脸，（打掉走狗总统帽子，揪下走狗尾巴，掀开幕，野兽正在张牙舞爪练武，山姆在旁边看着，一见壮士掀开幕，大家慌乱一团，群众蜂拥而上，齐声喊打、高呼口号。）
    野兽：唉呀！
    （三人爬起来，群众一拥而上，将三人抓起，高呼口号。）
    　　　　（第四场完）
