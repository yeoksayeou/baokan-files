　　[This Newspaper Reported] The North China Bureau recently received a report from the Taihang District Party Committee that more than a thousand remnant enemy troops under the command of bandit Wu Jingren, besieged in Anyang, raided a village on the border of Anyang on the 17th of this month. More than fifty members of the village militia immediately ascended the blockhouses to resolutely resist the bandit enemy. Unable to succeed, the bandits resorted to tricks of inducing surrender, but our militia vehemently denounced the enemy's shamelessness. At this time, the militia from the four stockaded villages heard the alarm and rushed to reinforce them. Seeing the situation was not in their favor, the bandits burned down the blockhouses defended by the militia, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of all fifty-plus members of the militia who bravely resisted. A certain regiment of our army and the Anyang County Brigade also rushed to their aid upon hearing the alarm, but it was too late to provide assistance. They then ambushed the bandits on their way back, severely striking the bandits, annihilating more than three hundred bandits, including the bandit regiment commander and below (including more than one hundred captured alive). The seizure is currently under investigation. The District Party Committee has instructed the Fifth Prefectural Committee and the Anyang County Committee to hold a memorial service and provide condolences and pensions to the martyred militia and their families. After receiving the report, the North China Bureau immediately telegraphed the Anyang County Committee, conveying their condolences. The original telegram is as follows: Taihang District Party Committee to Anyang County Committee:
    According to reports, more than fifty members of the militia of a certain village in your county resisted over a thousand bandit troops who launched a surprise attack, firmly defending the blockhouses and fighting resolutely. Finally, due to the burning of the blockhouses, all of them heroically sacrificed themselves, writing a moving and praiseworthy page in the history of the people's revolutionary war. The bandit army was also pursued and annihilated by our reinforcements, including the regimental commander and over three hundred others, because their protracted occupation delayed their retreat. This spirit of sacrificing life and being loyal to the revolution is truly a model for all the military and civilians in North China. In addition to holding a memorial service and providing generous pensions to their families, a special telegram of condolence is sent, hoping that it will be forwarded immediately.

　　安阳民兵五十多人抗击千余匪军
  　坚贞不屈壮烈牺牲
    华北局特电悼唁誉为军民楷模
    【本报讯】华北局顷接太行区党委报告困守安阳残敌吴匪景仁部千余人，于本月十七日袭扰我安阳边地某村，该村民兵五十余人立即登碉，坚决抗击匪敌。匪不得逞，乃施以诱降诡计，我民兵当大骂敌人无耻。此时四囤民兵闻警，急赶来增援。该匪见势不佳，竟将民兵所据守之碉楼焚毁，致五十余英勇抗击之民兵，全部壮烈牺牲。我某团及安阳县大队，亦闻警驰援，但已救援不及，遂于匪敌逃回途中设伏，痛击匪徒，歼匪团长以下三百余人（内生俘一百余），缴获正在清查中。该区党委已嘱五地委及安阳县委对壮烈牺牲的民兵及其家属，追悼抚恤。华北局接到报告后，当即电安阳县委，转致悼唁，原电如左：太行区党委转安阳县委：
    据报你县某村民兵五十余人，抗击奔袭匪军千人以上，固守碉堡，坚决战斗，卒因碉楼被焚，全部壮烈牺牲，在人民革命战争史上写成可歌可泣的一页。而匪军亦因旷日持久未及撤退被我援军追歼团长以下三百余人。此种牺牲生命、效忠革命的精神，实足为我华北全体军民的楷模。除应由你们召开追悼大会，并对其家属优予抚恤外，特电致唁，希即转致。
