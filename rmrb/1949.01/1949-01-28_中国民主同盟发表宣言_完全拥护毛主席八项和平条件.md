Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The China Democratic League issued a statement on the 21st, titled "Our Attitude Towards Peace." The full text is as follows:

　　Recently, the press reported on Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation, which put forward eight conditions for ending the war and realizing peace. The statement is righteous and reflects the will of the people of the whole country. For every person who truly loves peace, every word and every sentence in this document is undeniable.

　　Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation was issued to expose the "peace" conspiracy of the Nanjing war criminal clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek. Since the Battle of Jinan last autumn until the recent victorious conclusion of the Huaihai Campaign, the People's Liberation Army has successively liberated major cities such as Jinan, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Jinzhou, Changchun, Shenyang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Xuzhou, and Bengbu on the main battlefields of East China, Central Plains, Northeast, and North China, annihilating over a million of Chiang's elite troops. If we add the dozens of divisions besieged and annihilated in the Pingjin and Taiyuan areas, then the majority of Chiang's main forces can be said to have been wiped out. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is indeed on the verge of complete collapse. This reactionary ruling clique, in view of the fact that military defeat has reached an irreparable point, has once again picked up the "peace" mask of three years ago, launching a widespread "peace" offensive in an attempt to preserve the remaining strength of the Chiang dynasty through political negotiations, gain a respite, and then make a comeback in the future. Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation, on the one hand, fully exposed this "peace" conspiracy of the reactionaries; on the other hand, it clearly put forward the conditions for ensuring genuine and lasting peace. We have nothing more to say about this important document except to fully agree with and enthusiastically support it.

　　We support Chairman Mao's peace proposal not only because his proposal is very consistent with the requirements of the current situation and fully reflects the will of the people of the whole country; but also because this kind of peace proposal is basically in complete agreement with the League's views on the peace issue in the past year (since the Third Plenary Session). We have always advocated thorough peace. The so-called thorough peace, democratic peace, specifically speaking, is peace based on Chairman Mao's eight conditions today. The political report of the Third Plenary Session of the League emphasized that "the people's democracy can only be realized after the reactionary dictatorial ruling clique is overthrown." In order to seek thorough peace, "the root cause of the civil war must be eliminated" and "the obstacles to peace must be removed." What are the root cause of the civil war and the obstacles to peace? Everyone knows that it is the Kuomintang fascist reactionary group, which relies on American imperialism and is based on feudal exploitation and bureaucratic capital. Only by thoroughly eliminating this reactionary collective can we achieve a people's democratic peace.

　　Such peace is true peace, a thorough peace that the people of the whole country demand. The "peace" mentioned in Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day message is a complete fake peace, a reactionary "peace" demanded by the war criminals. Because the peace conditions put forward by Chiang Kai-shek include preserving the pseudo-constitution, the pseudo-legal system, and even guaranteeing his "suppression of rebellion" reactionary army, and he also attempts to lightly push all the responsibility for destroying peace and breaking out the civil war onto the Chinese Communist Party, which has repeatedly made concessions for peace. This is obviously not a sincere expression of peace, but a dangerous and vicious reactionary conspiracy.

　　Recalling that after the surrender of the Japanese invaders in 1945, based on the urgent demand of the people of the whole country for domestic peace, the League did not spare its efforts or shy away from difficulties and dangers, and did its best to promote the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the ceasefire agreement, the political consultation, and the military reorganization agreement. However, the Nanjing reactionary group violated the will of the people of the whole country and blatantly tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, destroying various peace agreements. Since July 1946, it launched a full-scale civil war; later, it convened a bogus National Assembly alone, passed an anti-democratic pseudo-constitution; organized a pseudo-coalition government; and issued a "suppression of rebellion" general mobilization order. Militarily, it occupied dozens of cities such as Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, Huaiyin, Linyi, Chengde, Changchun, and Andong, regardless of repeated warnings from the Communist Party of China and the just public opinion of the whole country. Until March 1947, it expelled personnel from the CCP representative office, closed the CCP's propaganda organs, and forcibly dissolved the League at the end of October. During this period, the League continued to fight for peace under extremely difficult conditions, and even sacrificed the lives of outstanding leading comrades such as Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, and Du Binheng. All these facts are still very fresh in people's memories, fully proving that the Kuomintang reactionary group is a criminal group that destroys peace and launches civil wars. At the same time, those facts also prove the League's current proposition; that only by thoroughly eliminating this reactionary group can we achieve true peace, which is a conclusion drawn from the painful experiences and lessons of the past three years. Therefore, if the Nanjing reactionary government does not want peace, then if it is sincere in seeking peace, it must fully accept the eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao as the basis for negotiations. We want to solemnly warn the ruling group in Nanjing, and all local governments and military groups under its system, that it is not possible for you to bargain over these eight conditions.

　　Finally, we would also like to call the attention of all compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to two points:

　　1. We must give a head-on blow to the "peace" movement recently launched by the pseudo-municipal councils of Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities under the control of people like the notorious secret service chief Pan Gongzhan. Because these pseudo-councilors, in the not-too-distant past, still fabricated public opinion and staged the ugly drama of supporting the "suppression of rebellion." But today, these pseudo-councilors have turned into beautiful "goddesses of peace." They are obviously attempting to masquerade as public opinion, disguise themselves as peace, in order to save the reactionary war criminal group from complete annihilation.

　　2. The reactionary government is now begging imperialists such as the United States, Britain, and France to come forward to mediate the Chinese civil war. American imperialism pretends to be disinterested in interfering in China's internal affairs; on the other hand, it secretly instigates. Compatriots across the country, especially those in the Chiang-controlled areas, must be vigilant and unite to resolutely shatter this vicious conspiracy of imperialism. Because the imperialists' instigation of mediation is actually an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs. But only the Chinese people have the right to handle China's affairs, and we must resolutely oppose any foreign interference.

　　The League hereby appeals to compatriots across the country to rise up together and resolutely fight for the realization of a truly lasting, thorough, and democratic peace.

### 中国民主同盟发表宣言　完全拥护毛主席八项和平条件

　　中国民主同盟发表宣言
  　完全拥护毛主席八项和平条件
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中国民主同盟于二十一日发表声明，题为“我们对和平的态度”。全文如下：
    最近报载中共中央主席毛泽东先生的时局声明，提出了结束战争，实现和平的八项条件，义正辞严，充分反映了全国人民的意志。对于每一个真正爱好和平的人，这一文件的每个字每句话，都是无法加以否定的。
    毛先生的时局声明，是为了揭斥以蒋介石为首的南京战犯集团的“和平”阴谋而发的。自去秋济南之役，到最近淮海战役的胜利结束为止，人民解放军在华东、中原、东北、华北几个主要战场上接连地解放了济南、郑州、开封、锦州、长春、沈阳、唐山、张家口、徐州、蚌埠等大城市，歼灭了蒋军精锐部队达百余万之众。若再加上平津太原方面被围被歼的数十个师，则蒋军的大部分主力，可说已被消灭殆尽。国民党反动统治确确实实已濒于全部崩溃的境地。这一反动统治集团，鉴于军事上的失败已至无可挽救的地步，乃重新拾起三年前的“和平”假面具来，发动了广大的“和平”攻势，企图通过政治谈判，以保存蒋朝残余力量，取得喘息机会，以便日后卷土重来。毛先生的时局声明，一方面充分地揭露了反动派的这种“和平”阴谋；另方面又明确地提出了保障真正持久和平的各项条件。我们对于这个重大的文件，除了完全赞同与热烈拥护而外，实在再无别话可说。
    我们拥护毛先生的和平主张，不但因为他的主张非常切合目前时局的要求，充分反映全国人民的意志；同时也因为这种和平主张，基本上和本盟一年来（三中全会以来）对和平问题的见解是完全一致的。我们一向主张彻底的和平。所谓彻底的和平、民主的和平，具体的说，也就是以今天毛先生的八项条件为基础的和平。本盟三中全会政治报告中，曾强调说：“人民的民主，只有在推翻反动独裁统治集团之后才能实现。”为求彻底的和平“就得扫除内战的根源”，“扫除和平的障碍”。什么是内战的根源与和平的障碍呢？谁也知道，那就是以美帝国主义为靠山，以封建剥削及官僚资本为基础的国民党法西斯反动集团。只有彻底扫除了这个反动集体，才能实现人民民主的和平。
    这样的和平，才是真和平，是全国人民所要求的彻底的和平。蒋介石元旦文告中所说的“和平”，却是十足的假和平，是战犯们所要求的反动的“和平”。因为蒋介石所提的和平条件中，有保存伪宪法、伪法统，乃至保障他的“戡乱”反动军队等类，而且还企图把破坏和平、爆发内战的全部责任轻轻地往曾经为和平而一再忍让的中国共产党身上推。这显然不是真诚和平的表示，而是危险毒辣的反动阴谋。
    回忆本盟在一九四五年日寇投降后，基于全国人民对国内和平之迫切要求，曾不辞劳怨，不避艰险，对国共谈判、停战协定、政治协商、整军协定等事之促成，尽其最大之努力。但南京反动集团，违反全国民意，悍然撕毁政协决议，破坏各项和平协定。自一九四六年七月起，发动了全面内战；后来又单独召开包办的伪国大，通过反民主的伪宪法；组织伪联合政府；颁布“戡乱”总动员令。在军事上，则不顾中共一再警告，不顾全国正义舆论，占领了延安、张家口、淮阴、临沂、承德、长春、安东等数十城市。直到一九四七年三月驱逐中共代表办事处人员，封闭中共言论机关，十月底强迫解散本盟。其间，本盟在万分艰险的条件之下，仍继续为和平奋斗，甚至牺牲了李公朴、闻一多、杜斌丞等优秀领导同志的生命。所有这一切事实，在人们记忆中还十分新鲜，充分证明了国民党反动集团是破坏和平、发动内战的罪犯集团，同时，那些事实也证明本盟今日之主张；要彻底扫除这一反动集团，才能实现真正和平，乃自过去三年来惨痛经验教训中所得来的结论。所以，南京反动政府不要和平则已，如真有诚意要求和平，它就非全部接受毛先生所提出的八项条件作为谈判基础不可。我们要郑重正告南京的统治集团，和它系统下的一切地方政府及军事集团，对于这八项条件，你们要讨价还价是不行的。
    最后，我们还要唤起国民党统治区全体同胞注意两点：
    一、最近象著名特务头子潘公展这类人主持下的上海、南京等伪市参议会所发动的“和平”运动，我们必须给以迎头痛击。因为这些伪参议会在不久的过去，还伪造民意，大演其拥护“戡乱”的丑剧。可是今天这些伪参议员们居然摇身一变，而为美丽的“和平女神”了。他们显然是企图假冒民意，化装和平，来挽救反动战犯集团全军覆灭的命运。
    二、反动政府现正哀求美、英、法等帝国主义者出来调停中国内战。美国帝国主义一面装腔作势地表演不干涉中国内政；一面却又暗中策动。这种调停的阴谋，全国同胞尤其是蒋管区的同胞必须提高警惕，团结一致，起来坚决纷碎帝国主义的这种毒辣阴谋。因为帝国主义者的策动调停，实际就是企图干涉中国内政。但中国的事，只有中国人民自己有权来处理，任何外国的干涉，我们是要坚决反对的。
    本盟兹特吁请全国同胞，一致奋起，为实现真正持久的彻底的民主的和平而坚决奋斗。
