　　Taihang Eight Thousand Soldiers and Civilians Gather
  　Warmly Celebrate Victories on All Fronts
    [Taihang Electric] On the third day of the victorious 1949, people from all walks of life in the Taihang Party, government, military, and civilian sectors, together with local residents, jointly held a celebration rally of more than 8,000 people to celebrate the great victories of the People's Liberation Army since the autumn offensive, and to welcome the even greater victories that will be achieved in 1949. Many Yangko teams and stilt walkers sang songs of victory and played joyful music, rejoicing and cheering for the upcoming final victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause. Commander Zhao Huilou of the military region called on the assembly to continue to improve the combat capabilities and regularization of the troops, and to completely eliminate the enemy in northern Henan and liberate the people of northern Henan in 1949. After explaining in detail the victories of our army on various battlefields, Leng Chu, secretary of the district party committee, called on the people to organize and carry out large-scale production movements, so that production would increase by even an inch. Actively support the front lines and carry out the democratic construction of political power. He particularly emphasized the need to mobilize and organize 300,000 women to participate in production. For the sake of large-scale production, it is necessary to improve the methods of wartime service, and those who exceed the regulations will be compensated by the government. It is necessary to conduct land assessment to overcome the phenomenon of unfair burden, so that farmers have the strength to carry out reproduction after paying their burden. It is also necessary to train a large number of doctors and prepare to train 600 midwives to reduce the diseases of labor and the death of children. Special attention should be paid to epidemic prevention this spring.
