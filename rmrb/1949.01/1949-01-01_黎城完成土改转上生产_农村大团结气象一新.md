Taihang Electric Dispatch: Licheng's work to conclude land reform (referred to as land reform below) began in September. As of now, all but thirteen villages in the county have been fully completed. The remaining 156 villages have all finished. Currently, the work is combining the final issuance of land certificates, completing party rectification, and mobilizing production. During the completion of land reform in the county, the status of 1,343 middle-peasant households who were mistakenly struggled against was rectified, with 598 households receiving compensation of over 1,100 mu of land. Among the landlords and rich peasants who were struggled against, 132 households in need of resettlement were appropriately resettled. Regarding 119 feudal landlords and rich peasants who were not thoroughly struggled against in the past or were missed, confiscation and requisition were carried out in accordance with policy. For 153 poor and landless peasant households who had not yet turned themselves around, over 550 mu of land was filled in. Moreover, over 1,800 mu of land was adjusted for 1,453 new middle-peasant households still lacking land. Due to the correct implementation of the Party's policies, enthusiastic support was received from the broad masses inside and outside the Party, eliminating various concerns of the people of all strata. The masses' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. After the completion of land reform, many villages have formulated long-term (three-year) and short-term (this winter) production plans. Many peasant households are making adobe bricks to build houses, adding livestock, and buying sheep. The masses reflected: "This is truly the implementation of Chairman Mao's policies. Now we can focus on production!" Currently, the county's rural areas present a new atmosphere of unity and production. According to statistics from 28 villages in the Fourth District, a total of 1,180 laborers and over 1,000 livestock have been organized to actively engage in various production activities such as opening workshops, transportation, and cutting mountain products. After a month of production in Shibidicun village in the Fifth District, each laborer earned an average of eight dou of rice. Almost every village in the county has an oil mill, not only providing oil for lighting and consumption, but also earning oil cakes, preparing for next year's fertilizer. Many villages have already begun repairing agricultural tools. Rural unity is becoming increasingly consolidated, and peasants are enthusiastically launching an organized production and construction movement.

The main experiences in achieving the above results are: First, the Party's policies have been universally publicized and implemented. Many villages conducted in-depth policy propaganda inside and outside the Party as soon as they began to conclude land reform. Some districts also conducted large-scale mobilization meetings based on key points, quickly disseminating policies through a large number of activists inside and outside the Party, stabilizing the masses' emotions in a timely manner, gaining the support of the broad masses of peasants, and enabling the smooth implementation of policies. Second, in mastering policies, studying was implemented, the left and right wavering of cadres was overcome at any time, and the reporting and requesting system was strictly implemented. The county and district committees personally went deep into a village to create experience in a planned way, criticize shortcomings, ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies, and improve cadres. For example, the Sixth District's absolute egalitarianism and the right-leaning errors of Beishe in the First District were corrected in a timely manner, which had a great effect on the correct implementation of policies throughout the county. Third, the conclusion of land reform must be combined with party rectification. Especially at the beginning, preliminary party rectification must be carried out first. Experience has proved that the branches in most villages have many problems. For example, many party members are unclear about the policies on concluding land reform and party rectification, and even have misconceptions; some branches are not united, or the relationship between cadres and the masses is uncoordinated. The existence of these problems affects the work enthusiasm of party members and the combat effectiveness of the branches. To this end, all villages paid attention to the link of preliminary party rectification, gave play to the leading role of the branches, and the Beiweiquan branch solved the historical factional struggle problem, the Nansanglu branch adjusted the contradictions between new and old cadres, the Xincun branch improved the relationship between the Party and the poor peasant associations, and many villages universally carried out branch mobilization and implemented the education of concluding land reform and party rectification policies, improved party members' awareness, consolidated unity inside and outside the Party, and made policy implementation reliable. Secondly, in concluding land reform, most villages paid attention to cultivating and giving play to the role of activists. According to statistics from 91 villages, a total of 689 activists emerged, including 2 poor and landless peasants, 503 new middle peasants, and 184 old middle peasants. Relying on these activists, all peasants were firmly united and organized, and the conclusion of land reform was correctly carried out. Fourth, the entire conclusion of land reform was closely combined with production. Most villages carried out the conclusion of land reform in the inspection and organization of production. For example, the first batch of villages to conclude land reform combined the collection of cultivated land preparation and the wheat planting campaign, and started the policy propaganda of who plants who harvests; the second batch of villages started from inspecting the autumn harvest, arranging autumn plowing, accumulating fertilizer, and the labor hero production summary meeting convened by each district, and launched the conclusion of land reform; the third batch of villages was combined with the deployment of winter production work. In this way, the current production was directly promoted in the conclusion of land reform, achieving non-delaying of agricultural time, gaining the support of the masses, and ensuring the smoother completion of the conclusion of land reform. Secondly, from the branch, the people's congress to the peasant association, a summary education of getting rich and organizing production was carried out based on reviewing the history and achievements of land reform. From point to surface, a winter production and three-year family building plan was drawn up. Some villages also combined current affairs education with future education to improve the peasants' enthusiasm for supporting the front line and their confidence in boldly producing and getting rich. Recently, the county party committee has arranged future work according to the instructions of the district party committee, starting with the inspection and promotion of production, combining the issuance of land certificates, deeply inspecting the conclusion of land reform, carrying out party rectification, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the party, so that the masses inside and outside the party can improve ideologically, politically, and organizationally.

　　黎城完成土改转上生产
  　农村大团结气象一新
    “这才真是实现了毛主席的政策！”
  　结合颁发土地证把生产推进一步
    【太行电】黎城的结束土地改革（下称土改）工作，从九月份开始，截至目前，全县除十三个村尚未完全结束外，其余一百五十六个村已全部完成。现正结合最后填发土地证，完成整党，发动生产。该县在结束土改中，共有一千三百四十三户误斗中农，订正了成份。其中五百九十八户得到一千一百余亩土地的补偿。被斗地富中，需要安置的一百三十二户，均适当的进行了安置。对过去斗争不澈底或漏斗了的一百一十九户封建地主、富农，均按照政策进行了没收与征收。没有翻了身的一百五十三户贫雇农，填补了五百五十余亩土地。并给一千四百五十三户尚缺地的新中农调剂了一千八百余亩土地。由于正确地贯彻了党的政策，得到党内外广大群众的热烈拥护，扫除了各阶层人民的各种顾虑。群众生产情绪普遍高涨，不少村在结束土改后，纷纷制订长期（三年）短期（今冬）的生产计划；许多农户打土坯修房盖屋，添牲口买羊。群众反映：“这才真是实现了毛主席的政策，以后可好好生产吧！”现全县农村，呈现出一片团结生产的新气象。据四区二十八个村统计：共组织起劳力一千一百八十个，牲口一千余头，积极进行开作坊、运输、砍山货等各项生产。五区石壁底村经过一个月来的生产，每个劳力平均得米八斗。全县差不多村村都有油坊。不但供给了点灯与吃用，而且赚得油饼，准备了明年的肥料。也有许多村现已开始修理农具，农村团结日趋巩固，农民开始热烈地开展着组织起来的生产建设运动。
    获得以上成绩的主要经验，第一、是普遍地贯彻宣传党的政策。许多村庄一着手进行结束土改，即在党内外进行了深刻的政策宣传。有的区并以基点为单位，进行了较大规模的会议动员，通过党内外大批积极分子，把政策迅速传布开来，及时稳定了群众情绪，得到了广大农民的拥护，使政策得以顺利贯彻下去。第二、在掌握政策上，贯彻了学习，随时克服干部中的左右摇摆，严格执行报告请示制度。县区委均亲自深入一个村有计划地创造经验，批判缺点，保证正确实现党的政策，提高干部。如及时纠正了六区的绝对平均思想，及一区北社的右偏错误等，对全县正确执行政策作用很大。第三、结束土改必须结合整党。尤其是开始时，必须首先进行初步整党。经验证明：大部分村的支部是存在着不少问题的。如很多党员对结束土改及整党政策不明确，甚至有错觉；部分支部不团结，或干群关系不协调等。这些问题的存在，影响着党员的工作积极性与支部的战斗力。为此，各村均注意了初步整党这一环节，发挥了支部的领导作用。北委泉支部解决了历史上的宗派斗争问题，南桑鲁支部调整了新老干部的矛盾，辛村支部改善了党和贫农团的关系，很多村均普遍进行了支部发动，贯彻了结束土改与整党政策的教育，提高了党员觉悟，巩固了党内外的团结，使政策执行有了依托。其次，在结束土改中，绝大部分村注意了培养与发挥积极分子的作用。根据九十一个村的统计：共涌现出六百八十九个积极分子，其中贫雇二个，新中农五百零三个，旧中农一百八十四个。依靠这些积极分子，巩固地团结与组织了全体农民，正确进行了结束土改。第四、在整个结束土改中，密切结合了生产。大多数村庄都是在检查与组织生产中进行了结束土改的。如第一批村结束土改是结合了收耕准备与种麦运动，进行了谁种谁收的政策宣传而开始的；第二批村是从检查秋收、布置秋耕、积肥及各区召开的劳动英雄生产总结大会入手，开展了结束土改；第三批村是与布置组织冬季生产工作相结合的。这样就在结束土改中直接推动了当前生产，做到了不误农时，得到了群众拥护，也就保证了结束土改的更顺利完成。其次，由支部、人代会到农会，均从回顾历史与土改成果的基础上进行了发家致富，组织起来生产的总结教育，由点到面订出冬季生产及三年建家计划。有的村并结合时事教育与前途教育，提高了农民的支援前线热情与大胆生产发家的信心。最近县委已根据区党委的指示，布置了今后工作，从检查推动生产入手，结合发土地证，深入检查结束土改，进行整党，开展党内外的批评与自我批评，使党内外群众从思想上、政治上、组织上提高一步。
