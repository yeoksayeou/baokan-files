In Beitiangong, Fifth District, Nangong, led by Party members such as Li Laoya, 105 households, totaling over 150 men and women, have dug six cellars and started winter weaving to ensure a comfortable life next spring. Everyone is highly motivated.

This winter, at the end of September, the work team arrived in the village. In addition to announcing the principles and methods of land reform and party rectification, they also proposed organizing and leading the masses in production. During the party rectification, Li Laoya, Li Laofu, and others were responsible for addressing the ideological obstacles and practical difficulties in the masses' production. They also actively mobilized the masses for production. Laofu said, "A group of women in the west end are spinning yarn on the Tianditang stage every day until midnight. Will they still be able to do this when it gets colder?" Laoya said, "If we dig cellars like the other villages, this problem can be solved. Maybe they'd be willing. Let's talk about it tomorrow." The next morning, while eating with the masses at the west gate of the village, Laofu said, "Selling two bolts of cloth can buy a bag of grain, which is equivalent to the harvest from one mu of land this year. How many days does it take to weave two bolts of cloth? Spinning and weaving are not bad compared to farming." Everyone said, "That's right. The harvest isn't very good this year, so weaving will help. It'll be cold soon, so we need to dig cellars, but we don't have wood or a place." Laofu said, "It's a big deal to avoid starvation next spring. Let's talk to those who have wood and see if we can put some together. I'll be responsible for finding a place." So, the women on the Tianditang stage spun yarn and talked about digging cellars all day. The next day at breakfast, the women and men all asked Laofu, "Have you found a place?" Laofu said, "The field outside my gate is warm and close." On the third day, everyone started collecting wood, and the seventeen spinning wheels on the Tianditang stage were organized. Everyone happily calculated: when it gets cold, we'll all go back to our own homes to spin, and we'll need seventeen lamps at night; how much oil can we save?

Party members help to find solutions: Digging cellars is warm and saves oil

After this news spread, the work team introduced it at a mass meeting. Party member Li Zilin said that the women in their area also wanted to dig cellars, and so did the women in Li Xinkao's area. The branch meeting decided that Zilin and Xinkao would find places for everyone and call on everyone to collect wood. While helping the masses find ways to solve their difficulties, they also calculated with the masses: how much grain can they earn by spinning until the end of the year? Women with children can also bring their children to the cellars, where it is warm and they can work more, so they won't have to worry about not having grain next spring. In a few days, six cellars were dug in the village, covering the ground of twenty rooms. One hundred and five households, fifteen looms, and ninety-nine spinning wheels were organized to go inside. In addition to women, 34 men who knew how to spin and weave also participated.

At this time, Laofu, Laoya, and others divided the work. Each day one person would go to the cellars and, during breaks, hang up signs and teach people to read. First, they learned to recognize Jinnan currency, and then Renminbi, and they talked about the exchange rates of several currencies. Sometimes they would lead everyone in singing and games (for the young girls) to relieve fatigue, and then they would spin again. Everyone said, "It's busier than harvesting wheat and autumn crops!" Old man Li Laorui, who was seventy-two years old, could spin half a jin of yarn on average every day. He calculated that he could earn 300 yuan in new currency per month. Gao Er'ai and her daughter wove three military cloths and received 360 jin of grain. They planned to weave three more cloths, and they wouldn't have to worry about food for the New Year and next spring. Because there were many people and few tools, and the cloth sold quickly at the market, everyone was actively spinning and weaving. Because the days were short, the families took turns spinning and weaving. The young women and girls worked the first half of the night, and the old women got up before dawn to replace them. Now the cellars are indistinguishable day and night, and the sound of the looms never stops. The buzzing of the wheels, the clattering of the shuttles, mixed with occasional laughter, filled the air with joy and tension.

The cellars are humid, making it easy to produce coarse yarn. Everyone said: if the yarn is coarse, the cloth won't sell well; one bolt of cloth uses one jin of cotton waste too much, which costs more than 40 yuan. So everyone is trying to spin fine yarn. From the time the cellars were dug to November 15th, in less than twenty days, four cellars alone had woven 338 zhang of cloth. Now that the military cloth is almost finished, and everyone will soon be spinning and weaving for themselves, the branch is starting to discuss organizing trips to the market to solve the difficulties of each household in selling cloth and buying cotton.

　　北天宫一片机杼声
    南宫五区北天宫村，在支部党员李老雅等带头领导下，组织起一百零五户、男女一百五十多人，挖好六个窨子，开展冬季纺织，保证明春生活不困难，大家情绪很高。
    今冬九月底工作组到该村，除宣布了土改整党的方针与做法外，同时提出要组织领导群众进行生产。整党中，由党员李老雅、李老福等负责，除了群众家生产中的思想障碍和实际困难外，并积极向群众进行生产的动员。老福说：“西头一伙妇女，每天在天地堂台上纺花，一直纺到半夜，以后天冷了，他们还能这样么？”老雅说：“如果也象人家外村一样挖了窨子，这问题就能解决了。也许她们愿意，明天说一说看。”第二天早饭时，老福就在西寨门口和群众一面吃饭，一面说：“现在卖两个布能换一口袋谷子，能顶今年一亩地的收成。织两个布能用多少天哪？纺花织布比种地也不坏。”大家都说：“不错。今年收成又不怎么好，织布就是顶事。天冷了得挖窨子，就是没木头，没地方。”老福说：“明年春天不挨饿这是个大事，咱把有木头的说一说凑一凑看行不行，地方我负责找。”这样，天地堂台的妇女们纺着花就把挖窨子的事说道了一天。第二天早饭时，女人和男人们都问老福说：“你找着地方了吗？”老福说：“我大门外的场里，又暖和又近。”第三天大家就动手凑起木头，天地堂台上的十七辆纺花车就这样组织起来了。大家高兴地合计着：天一冷，各回各家纺，夜晚得用十七个灯；这样光油该省多少？
    党员帮助想办法　挖好地窨子暖和又省油
    这消息传出后，工作组又在群众大会上作了介绍。党员李子林说，他们那一片的妇女也要求挖窨子，李新考那一片也是这样。支部会就确定子林、新考去为大家找地方，号召大家凑木头。他们一面帮助群众想办法解决困难，一面和群众算帐：纺到年底能赚多少粮食，有小孩的妇女也可以带孩子到窨子里去，又暖和又多作活，这样就不再愁明年春天没粮食吃了。不几天工夫，全村挖起了六个窨子，共合二十间房的地面，有一百零五户，十五张织布机和九十九辆纺花车组织进去。除了妇女，尚有会纺织的男子三十四人参加。
    这时老福、老雅等又分了工，每天有一个人到窨子里去，在大家休息时，挂上牌子教一会儿认字。先认冀南票，后又认人民票，讲几种票的比值。有时候领导大家唱歌、游戏（小姑娘们）恢复疲劳，接着又纺。大家说：“比过秋过麦还忙！”李老瑞老头七十二岁了，平均每天能纺半斤线。他计算每月能赚新币三百元。高二爱娘儿俩织了三个军布，领到谷子三百六十斤。她们计划再织三个布，今年过年和明年春天的粮食就都不发愁了。因为人多工具少，集上的布卖的快，大家都争着积极纺积极织，白天时间短，便一家人换班纺织。上半夜是青年妇女和小姑娘，下半夜老太太们起五更来替换。现在窨子里是昼夜不分，机声不断。嗡嗡的轮声，＠＠的梭声，间杂着不时的说笑声，充满着愉快和紧张。
    窨子里潮湿，很容易出粗线。大家说：线粗了，布不好卖；一个布多用一斤穰子就四十多元。所以都在力求纺匀细线。从刨好窨子到十一月十五日，不满二十天，只四个窨子统计，已织出布三百三十八丈。现在因为军布已快织完，即将自纺自织，所以支部又在开始讨论组织赶集，解决各户卖布买花的困难。
