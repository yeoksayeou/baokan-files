Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 17th. Telecommunications Agency, Prague, January 12th: There is no reason to believe that the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Royalist Fascist Army, Alexander Papagos, will be able to salvage the overall defeat that the Greek Democratic Government is preparing for the Royalist Fascists.

As is well known, the "encirclement and annihilation campaigns" carried out in 1947 under the command of British General Rawlins and in 1948 under the command of American General Frick did not achieve the goal of eliminating the Democratic Army. After each battle, the Democratic Army recovered the areas that had been "swept" by the Royalist Fascist army. Moreover, at the end of 1948, the Democratic Army had become, as the Greek Provisional Democratic Government declared, "a powerful regular army, well-organized, and more capable of guaranteeing victory than ever before. 1949 will be a year of decisive and victorious battles."

As a result of the Royalist Fascist defeats at the end of 1948, all the major generals—Ventiris, Spiliotopoulos, Drakos, Kitsaras, Georgoulis, Papageorgiou, and others—were either dismissed or demoted. Every Greek general had tried his best to eliminate the Democratic Army, but they were all eventually forced to admit that, despite American aid, "eliminating" the Democratic Army was beyond their capabilities. Despite Frick's speeches praising his lackeys as the best generals in the world, the contempt of the Royalist Fascist soldiers for these puppet generals is rapidly growing. In the past two years, the Royalist Fascist army has suffered enormous losses in personnel and supplies. Although the United States has made up for the losses in supplies, the losses in personnel cannot be made up, because this has deeply weakened the army's strength. By the end of 1948, the Royalist Fascist personnel losses amounted to approximately 100,000. American journalist Robert Low, in his recent observations on his visit to Greece published in Time magazine, admitted: "In 1947, there were not many red circles on the military map indicating areas controlled by guerrillas, while in 1948, although there were still some blue circles indicating areas occupied by the government, they were few in number. Except for Athens, Salonika, and certain other cities, the rest of the map is covered in red." After experiencing enough pain and constant bloodshed, the Athens army's morale has been depressed and it has lost confidence in the possibility of victory. The increasing number of desertions, the frequent refusal of junior officers to carry out the orders of their superiors, and the arrest, conviction, and execution of dozens of officers and soldiers prove this point. Even the air force, which was considered the most loyal to the Royalist Fascists while in service, had thirty-one senior officers arrested recently, six of whom will be tried by military court. Another significant event is that the military committee recently dismissed 300 senior officers on the grounds of low morale. The army and the people are demanding an end to the war with "pen and ink," that is, an end to the war with the signing of an agreement between the two sides.

This is the situation facing the American imperialists and their Royalist Fascist servants. Therefore, the United States is trying to create a glimmer of hope by appointing Papagos, hoping that Papagos will be able to get them out of the predicament they have fallen into.

Papagos served as the commander-in-chief of the Greek army during the victorious war against Italy in 1940-41. They are trying to use this point to embellish Papagos. However, they have forgotten two things: first, the 1940-41 war was essentially a people's war against the fascist aggressors who threatened the independence and freedom of Greece. But now, the soldiers are fighting for a regime that represents the interests of foreign imperialism and a group of traitors and is not supported by the people. Second, Papagos himself made no contribution to the victory in 1940, and due to his cowardice, incompetence, and other shameful facts, he was given the nickname "General of the British Basement" by the people.

The Royalist Fascists are also trying to delay their defeat with other measures: they are mobilizing women, doctors, chemists, and engineers to participate in the civil war in Greece for the first time, and they are also conscripting some civil servants and the first batch of 20,000 farmers into the army. They are sending convalescing or unconvalesced wounded soldiers back to the front line and preparing to conscript 18-year-old youths into the army, just as the Hitlerites did in 1945. The Athens traitors are providing cannon fodder, while Marshall, Royal, and Harriman are promising to supply cannons, tanks, and airplanes. However, these measures will undoubtedly not save the Athens regime, as the Provisional Democratic Government has already clearly stated. The reasons are: first, the boundless heroism shown by the Democratic Army fighters and their determination to win this year; second, the decline in enemy morale; third, the increasingly widespread participation of the people in the struggles on the front lines and in the cities.

　　雅典法西斯集团正走向覆灭
  　希民主军将于今年获胜
  　电通社评希腊军事形势
  　美援救不了雅典政权法西斯军队逃亡日众
    【新华社陕北十七日电】电通社布拉格十二日讯：没有理由相信：新任希腊保皇法西斯陆军总司令亚历山大。贝贝格斯，将能挽救希腊民主政府正给保皇法西斯准备的全盘失败。
    众所周知，一九四七年在英国罗林斯将军指挥下和一九四八年在美国佛立特将军指挥下所采取的“围歼战”，并未达到消灭民主军的目的。每一次战斗以后，民主军都光复了为保皇法西斯军所“扫荡”的地区。而且在一九四八年底，民主军已成为希腊临时民主政府所宣布的那样“一支强大的正规军，有良好的组织，并比过去任何时候都更能保证胜利。一九四九年将是有决定意义的胜利战斗的一年”。
    一九四八年末，保皇法西斯失败的结果，一切主要的将领——温蒂利斯、斯庇利奥托波洛斯、德拉科斯、基茨拉吉斯、乔治奥利斯、巴巴乔治奥及其他数人——或被革职，或被降级录用。希腊每一个将领都曾出力企图消灭民主军，但他们终于全部被迫承认：尽管有美国的援助，而“消灭”民主军却不是他们力所能及的。尽管佛立特在演说中称赞他的走卒们是世界上最好的将领，但是，保皇法西斯军士兵们对这些傀儡将领们的轻蔑，正迅速增长着。两年来，保皇法西斯军在人员与物资上遭到了巨大的损失。虽然美国弥补了物资上的损失，但人员的损失则是无法弥补的，因为这已深重地削弱了军队的实力。截至一九四八年底，保皇法西斯人员的损失约达十万人。美国新闻记者罗伯特·劳氏在时代杂志上发表了他最近访希的观感，他承认：“一九四七年，军事地图上标明游击队控制区的红圈还是不多的，而一九四八年，标明政府占领区的蓝圈虽还有一些，但却已为数不多了。除了雅典、萨罗尼加及其他某些城市，地图上的其余部分都已涂上了红色”。雅典陆军在尝够痛苦的经验和不断的流血以后，士气业已沮丧，并且丧失了可能胜利的信心。逃亡人数的增多，下级军官屡屡拒绝执行上级的命令，好几十名军官与士兵的被逮捕、判罪和处死，就证明了这一点。甚至在服役中被认为最忠于保皇法西斯的空军，也有三十一名较高级的军官在最近被捕，其中有六人将受到军事法庭的审判。另一个显著的事件，就是军事委员会不久以前又以士气不振为理由，解除了三百名较高级军官的职务。军队以及人民都要求以“笔杆子”来结束战争，这就是说，以双方签订协定来结束战争。
    这就是美帝国主义者及其保皇法西斯从仆们所面临着的情势。因此，美国就图以任命贝贝格斯来创造一种希望，希望贝贝格斯将能使他们摆脱业已陷入的困境。
    一九四○年——四一年反意大利的胜利战争期间，贝贝格斯曾任希军总司令。他们企图利用这一点来装饰一下贝贝格斯。但是，他们忘掉了两件事情：第一、一九四○——四一年的战争，本质上是反对威胁希腊独立自由的法西斯侵略者的人民战争。而现在，士兵们却是为着代表外国帝国主义及一批卖国贼利益的、不为人民所拥戴的政权而战。第二、贝贝格斯本人对一九四○年的胜利毫无贡献，而且由于他的胆怯和无能等可耻的事实，曾被人民冠以“大不列颠地下室的将军”的绰号。
    保皇法西斯并希图以其他措施来延缓它们的失败：它们正在希腊首次动员妇女、医生、化学家、工程师参加内战，它们也正征召若干文官和第一批为数两万名的农民入伍。它们正把痊愈了的或者没有痊愈的伤兵送回前线，并准备征召十八岁的青年入伍，正象希特勒分子一九四五年所作的一样。雅典卖国贼提供充当炮灰的兵员，而马歇尔、罗雅尔及哈里曼则约许供给大炮、坦克和飞机。但是，这些措施无疑地将挽救不了雅典政权，临时民主政府业已明白地说过了这点。理由就是：第一、民主军战士们所表现的无限的英雄主义和在今年取得胜利的决心；第二、敌人士气的衰落；第三、人民越来越广泛地参加前线及城市的斗争。
