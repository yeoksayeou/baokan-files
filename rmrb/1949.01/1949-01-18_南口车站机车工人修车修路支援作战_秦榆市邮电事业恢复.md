[Zhangjiakou, 13th] Nankou is a major station on the Ping-Sui Railway's Ping-Zhang section. Out of the town's 15,000 residents, 1,260 are workers at the railway locomotive factory. The Nankou Locomotive Factory is the largest factory on the Ping-Sui Railway. Most of the damaged vehicles on the Ping-Zhang section are repaired at this factory. When our army liberated the town last December, thanks to the rapid advance of our troops and the workers' efforts to protect the factory, it remained intact. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers are demonstrating a high degree of labor enthusiasm to support the front lines and have quickly resumed work. By the 18th of last month, they had completed the reopening of the railway line from Kangzhuang to Qinghuayuan, repaired nine locomotives and carriages, and also repaired a large number of vehicles and weapons. The workers' own class organization, the Trade Union Preparatory Committee, has also been established, and a workers' night school has been set up. Workers are striving to improve their cultural and political awareness through study.

[Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 15th] Thanks to the active work of postal and telecommunications staff after liberation, postal and telecommunications services in Qinhuangdao and Yushu Cities are rapidly recovering and developing. The day after the city was liberated, on November 29th last year, intra-city telephone services were restored; long-distance telephone lines directly to Beidaihe, Shanhaiguan, Haiyang, and Haibin were also repaired. The Telecommunications Bureau is now rushing to repair the transmitter and preparing to begin wired telegraph and long-distance telephone communication with various parts of the Northeast. The city's post office began selling stamps on December 3rd last year, established postal routes to the Northeast, and began accepting registered mail on the 20th. The average number of letters received by the bureau each day has increased from 65 when it was first liberated to more than 440. All postal and telecommunications staff have a high morale at work after liberation. In less than ten days, the staff of the Telecommunications Bureau repaired three duplex switchboards, one relay machine, and one DC and one AC generator. Post office staff even used iron-wheeled carts to deliver mail from Shanhaiguan to Qinhuangdao at night, a stark contrast to their perfunctory attitude under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits before liberation.

[Jizhong Pingjin Frontline Telegram] After the liberation of Langfang, workers in various industries actively established their own organizations, trade unions, and actively supported the front lines. The stevedore workers' union has 75 members; the public cotton ginning factory union has 21 members; and workers at the state-owned Oriental Grain Depot have organized workers' groups. Since the establishment of trade unions, under their leadership, workers have enthusiastically participated in supporting the front. Stevedore workers transported military grain, and on New Year's Day alone, 80 workers carried 2,000 packages (3,000 jin per package) of grain from the station to the warehouse. They said, "How can we not be active in transporting grain for our army!" Workers also voluntarily reported hidden enemy agents, guns, and supplies. To solve the temporary living problems of laid-off workers and poor citizens, the Langfang Military Control Commission provided relief to them on the third day of its operation (December 29th). A total of 15,830 jin of relief grain was distributed, helping 550 households and 1,795 people. Workers and poor citizens said, "The Nationalists didn't care even if we starved to death when they were in power. As soon as the People's Liberation Army came, they gave us food when we had nothing to eat." Workers are now resuming work, and citizens are also trying to produce.

　　南口车站机车工人修车修路支援作战
  　秦榆市邮电事业恢复
    【张垣十三日电】南口是平绥铁路平张段上的大车站，全镇一万五千人口中，铁路机车厂工人即达一千二百六十人。南口机车厂，是平绥路规模最大的工厂。平张段的残破车辆，大部均由该厂修理，去年十二月我军解放该镇时，由于我进军迅速，工人群众奋力保护，工厂完好无损。现在工人群众在共产党领导下，为着支援前线，又以高度的劳动热忱，很快复工，到上月十八日止，完成了康庄至清华园的通车，修理了九个机车和车箱，还修理了大量的汽车和武器。工人自己的阶级组织——工会筹备委员会，亦已建立，并设立了工人夜校，为了提高文化和政治觉悟，工人们正在努力学习。
    【新华社冀东十五日电】由于解放后邮电员工的积极工作，秦榆市邮政电信事业正迅速恢复和发展中。该市解放次日，即去年十一月二十九日，市内电话即恢复通话；直达北戴河、山海关、海阳、海滨四地的长途电话线路也经修复。电信局现正赶修发报机，准备与东北各地开始有线电报与长途电话的通报通话之用。该市邮局于去年十二月三日开始出售邮票，建立了通往东北的邮路，二十日即收寄挂号函件。该局每日平均收信数量已从刚解放时的六十五件增到四百四十余件。全体邮电员工在解放后工作情绪高涨。不到十天的工夫，电信局员工即修好了一间的复式交换机三台，中继机一台，直流交流发电机各一台。邮局员工在夜间还用铁轮车由山海关向秦皇岛推送邮件，这与解放前他们在蒋匪统治下得过且过的作风截然不同。
    【冀中平津前线电】廊房解放后，各业工人，积极建立工人自己的组织——工会，并积极支援前线。脚行工人工会，已有会员七十五人；公营轧花厂工会，已有会员廿一人；国营东方粮栈工人，已组织了工人小组。工人们自从建立起工会以后，在工会的领导下，踊跃参加了支前工作。脚行工人赶运军粮，只元旦一天，八十个工人就把二千包（一包三千斤）粮食，从车站背到了仓库。他们说：“给咱们军队运粮，不积极还行！”工人们还自动检举暗藏的特务枪支和物资。为解决停业工人和贫苦市民的暂时生活问题，廊房军事管制委员会在开始办公的第三天（十二月二十九日），就对他们实行了救济。总计共发放救济粮一万五千八百三十斤，救济了五百五十户，一千七百九十五人。工人和贫苦市民都说：“国民党占着时饿死也不管，解放军一来我们没饭吃就放粮。”现工人正在复工，市民们也正在设法生产。
