Let's see how Zhang Youlin and Wang Laifa learn?
    Comrade Zhang Youlin of the Fourth District of Wuxiang, Taihang, studies very hard. When he was transferred to the district last year, he only knew about two hundred characters, but he couldn't write any. Now he can recognize more than seven hundred characters and can write simple letters. How did he learn so quickly? (1) Write whatever you see: When he encounters a cadre, he asks the person's name and position and immediately writes it down. When watching the opera "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," he writes down the name of the opera. (2) Write whatever you do: For example, if the central task is winter production, he writes down "winter production." If he eats steamed buns today, he writes down "steamed buns." (3) Write wherever you go: For example, when he went to work in the Fourth District, he wrote down the names of all the villages in the district. (4) Study regularly: He reads and writes whenever he has time, asks people who are literate, asks them to teach him, and sets a plan to learn two new characters every day.
    Comrade Wang Laifa of the Seventh District was transferred to the district in July last year. After arriving in the district, he felt the difficulty of not knowing how to read. He made up his mind, made a study plan. He always carries a cultural textbook printed by the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee. Whenever he has time, he asks people to teach him. He writes everywhere, often writes, during the day on the walls and on the ground, and at night he can't sleep so he writes on his belly. After four months, he can now write simple letters and take simple notes.

　　看张有林王来发是怎样学习的？
    太行武乡四区张有林同志学习很努力。去年调区工作时，他只识得二百来字，可是一个也写不出。现在能认得七百多字并能写简单书信了。他怎样学习得这样快呢？（一）见啥写啥：遇到干部，他就问人家的名字、职务，马上记下来。看演王贵与李香香戏，把戏名记下来。（二）作啥写啥：如中心工作是冬季生产，就记下冬季生产。今天吃蒸馍，就记下蒸馍。（三）到哪里写哪里：如他到四区工作，把全区的村名都记下来了。（四）经常学习：有空就念就写，见了识字的人就问，就让教他，并订出了每天识两个生字的计划。
    七区王来发同志是去年七月调区工作的，到区后就感到不认字的困难了。他下了决心，订出学习计划，他身上常带着一本地委宣传部印的文化课本，有空就让人教他，他到处写、经常写，白天在墙上、地下写，夜晚睡不着在肚皮上写。经过四个月的时间，现在他能写简单信、记简单笔记了。
