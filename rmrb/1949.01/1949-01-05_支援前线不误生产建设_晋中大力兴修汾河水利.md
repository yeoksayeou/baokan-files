Jinzhong Electricity: Farmers along the汾 River in Qingyuan, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Qi County, Pingyao, and Jiexiu counties in Jinzhong District, in conjunction with supporting the Taiyuan Campaign, are working together under the leadership of the democratic government to vigorously build汾 River water conservancy in preparation for large-scale production next year. This river is the largest water conservancy project in Shanxi. Farmers along the river in Jinzhong have historically built eight huge dams and embankments in the spring and winter seasons to block the river water and irrigate the fertile land on both banks. During the old regime, officials supervised and gentry managed the project, with the leadership held by feudal forces. Water conservancy agencies were extravagant and wasteful, arbitrarily squandering funds and exploiting farmers by levying water fees every year during irrigation. Villages upstream often relied on their power to seize water courses, affecting downstream irrigation, leading to unequal distribution of benefits and many unfair and unreasonable phenomena. In addition, the years of rule by the Japanese and Yan Xishan hindered and destroyed the project, causing the canals in various counties to become silted and unmaintained, reducing the irrigated area by almost half. After the liberation of Jinzhong, the People's Government, based on the urgent demands of the local masses, carried out preparation work for repairs in various counties. At the end of October, the Administrative Office held a production and construction conference, further defining the unified and strengthened leadership of the汾 River water conservancy, absorbing cadres from various counties involved in water conservancy construction to form the Jinzhong Water Conservancy Committee, and allocating 1,500 dan of millet as water conservancy loans. In order to save manpower and materials, the Water Conservancy Committee decided to promote mutual assistance between upstream and downstream areas along the entire river, concentrating efforts on building only the Guanghui, Guangji, Liren, Tianshun, and Yongji dams this winter, breaking the old feudal practice of each county building its own dam. This approach not only saves labor but also ensures that everyone can enjoy the benefits of water conservancy. Take the Tianyi and Yanchang dams built by Qi County and Jiexiu County last winter as examples. They originally irrigated more than 80,000 mu of land. Qi County extracted a part of the manpower to join Wenshui in building the Liren dam, and fourteen villages including Beiyan Salt Field in Jiexiu dug and repaired the Yongji dam in Pingyao, to supply the east and west main canals. In addition to continuing to irrigate the original land enjoying water conservancy, it can save 20,000 man-days and more than 2,000 dan of fine grains. Jiexiu also plans to double the length of the east and west original canals next spring, increasing the irrigated area from 40,000 mu to 90,000 mu. Various counties have carried out preliminary rectification and transformation of the original water conservancy bureaus. After carrying out organization and mobilization to repair the dams, the five dams started construction successively at the end of October and the beginning of November. To ensure that both production and support for the front are not delayed, the counties have taken care to adjust the use of civilian labor to support the front in the villages along the river. When the second batch of civilian workers from Qingyuan participated in the war, only more than 200 people were dispatched from the Fourth District. Kong Village, near the Guanghui dam, was temporarily exempted from military service. In the six counties, more than 190 villages, in addition to mobilizing the semi-labor force such as the civilian workers participating in the war and the women and children remaining in the villages to renovate the canals, more than 3,500 laborers went to build the dams. They set out early and returned late every day, braving the wind and cold, digging soil from the distant banks and gradually carrying out the capping project. The Guanghui dam east of Kong Village in Qingyuan is the first dam upstream. Starting from October 14th, it was jointly built by 33 villages in Qingyuan and 10 villages in Qi County, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng. It is 80 zhang long, 6.5 zhang wide, and 1.4 zhang high, requiring more than 16,000 man-days and moving 728,000 cubic feet of earth. The original plan was to first cap the dam to irrigate the land in the upstream villages, and then cap the four downstream main dams to strive to irrigate the land along the river in the six counties before the spring plowing this year. However, because the opening of the Guanghui dam failed twice, it was decided to change to capping the second dam (Guangji dam, within Wenshui). To this end, in addition to sending people to supervise and strengthen leadership, the Jinzhong Water Conservancy Committee, the Administrative Office has increased the loan of 200 dan of grain in Wenshui to 500 dan to solve financial difficulties. The number of river workers has increased to more than 1,200, and they are now vigorously working on the capping. Qingyuan is now using the Jinfen River water from Jinci, Taiyuan County, in an attempt to remedy the situation. It is estimated that it can also irrigate more than 60,000 mu of land. During the construction, the unreasonable methods of forced orders, no wages, and dispatching labor were abolished. Pingyao and other counties settled the old water assets and implemented the current rice wage system with the remaining grain, and used the method of replacing relief with work to absorb people who could not irrigate the land to participate, solving the problem of winter grain shortage for poor farmers. The excavation method adopts a group-based, section-based contracting system, and a full laborer can earn six or seven jin of rice per day, which has boosted the morale of the river workers. Up to now, dozens of canals in various counties have been renovated. The water inlets of each dam, which are built from both banks, are only about two zhang wide. After the Guangji dam is capped, it will be capped. It is expected that more than 600,000 mu of land can still be irrigated this winter and spring. Calculating the minimum increase of two dou per mu, it will be possible to increase production by 120,000 shi.

Jinzhong Electricity: The Second and Third Sub-districts of Jinzhong are actively surveying and renovating old canals, and vigorously restoring water conservancy. Since October, in addition to the farmers in nearly 100 villages along the汾 River in Qi County, Pingyao, and Jiexiu working with the farmers in Qingyuan, Wenshui, Jiaocheng and other counties in the Second Sub-district to build the汾 River water conservancy, the farmers in various districts and villages on both sides of the Tongpu Railway have also begun to restore various water conservancy projects. During the first stage of the Taiyuan Campaign, under the slogan of "Supporting the front while engaging in production," Yuci County restored four canals, including Guanjia, Wanchun, and Wangcun, each irrigating more than 70,000 mu of land. The Hongshan water conservancy in Jiexiu historically irrigated 54,000 mu of land in the eastern township (including 4,500 mu of paddy fields) through the four canals of the East River, West River, Middle River, and Jialing River, and powered hundreds of water mills. There is a lot of alkaline land in Jiexiu, and the masses are being mobilized and organized to prepare to dig wells this year and change it into paddy fields. The Tianshun, Minsheng, and Xiaohe canals being surveyed in Taigu County are planned to start construction next spring. The Tianshun and Minsheng canals alone can irrigate more than 20,400 mu of land. In Qi County's plan to restore 60,000 mu of paddy fields, in addition to increasing the汾 River irrigation from the previous 25,000 mu to 30,000 mu, preparations for the water conservancy projects of the Wuma, Changyuan and other rivers are also underway. Because the Shahe, Dongjihe, Tinggang, and Guangou rivers in the southeast of Pingyao County have been silted for many years, they often flood in the summer and cause disasters. The county is reorganizing the water conservancy organization, expanding the water conservancy bureau that used to manage the汾 River exclusively, and absorbing the villages along the Chi River in the southeast to form a two-county water conservancy committee. While repairing the汾 River water conservancy, the survey of the Liugen, Shahe and other rivers has also begun. After the water conservancy projects of the above eight rivers are repaired, more than half of the 874,000 mu of land in the two counties will be able to enjoy water conservancy. As for the difficulties in the restoration of expenses and construction, they are being discussed and resolved under the principle of "government and people working together."

　　支援前线不误生产建设
  　晋中大力兴修汾河水利
    【晋中电】晋中区清源、文水、交城、祁县、平遥、介休六县沿汾河农民，与支援太原战役相结合，正由民主政府领导，协力兴修汾河水利，准备明年大生产。该河为山西第一大水利，晋中沿河农民，历年春冬两季修筑八道巨大坝埝，拦阻河水灌溉着两岸肥沃土地。旧政权时期，官督绅办，领导权为封建势力所掌握，水利机关铺张浪费，任意挥霍，乘每年浇地起摊水费，盘剥农民。上游村庄则往往倚势抢占水程，影响下游浇地，苦乐不均，存在许多不公道不合理现象。加以日、阎多年统治，阻挠破坏，致使各县渠道淤塞失修，浇地面积几减缩半数。晋中解放后，人民政府依据当地群众迫切要求，在各县进行了兴修准备，十月底行署召开生产建设会议，更确定了统一与加强对汾河水利的领导，吸收各县建设水利干部参加，组成晋中水利委员会，并拨发水利贷款小米一千五百石。水委会为了节省人力物力，决定全河上下游互助，集中力量，今冬只筑广惠、广济、利轫、天顺、永济等五埝，打破以往封建本位各县分筑的旧例，这样做不但省工，且均能享受水利。以祁县、介休两县去冬修筑之天义、延长两埝为例，原浇地八万余亩，祁县抽出部分人力与文水合修利轫埝，介休北盐场等十四村则挖修平遥永济埝，以下东、西两大干水两县。除仍可浇原享水利地亩外。并可节省人工两万，细粮两千余石。介休并计划明春将东、西原渠都增长一倍，浇地由四万亩增至九万亩。各县对原有水利局初步整顿改造，进行了修埝组织动员后，五道埝于去年十月底十一月初先后开工。为作到生产支前两不误，各县对沿河村庄支前民力的动用均予以照顾调剂。清源第二批民工参战时，四区仅出动二百余人。靠近广惠埝的孔村则临时免除军勤。六个县一百九十余村除将参战民工和留村妇女儿童等半辅劳力动员去整修渠道外，前往筑埝劳力达三千五百余人。每日早出晚归，冒着风寒，从两岸远处掘土，逐步进行合垄工程。清源孔村以东的广惠埝为上游第一道埝，从十月十四日开始，由清源卅三个村及祁县、文水、交城十个村联合修筑，长八十丈、宽六丈五、高一丈四，需工一万六千余个，移动土方七十二万八千立方尺。原计划首先合垄该埝，浇灌上游村庄土地，继即合垄下游四道干埝，争取今年春耕前将六县沿河土地浇完；但因广惠埝两次合口未成，决定改合第二道埝（广济埝、在文水境内）。对此，晋中水委会除派人督促，加强领导外，行署并将文水贷粮二百石增至五百石，解决经费困难。河工已增至千二百余人，现正大力合垄中。清源则正引用太原县晋祠晋汾河水，以谋补救。据估计，亦可浇地六万余亩。修筑中，废除了以往强迫命令、不给工资和派夫制等不合理的办法。平遥等县结算旧水资，以结存粮食实行了现米工资制，并用以工代赈办法吸收浇不上地的人参加，解决了贫苦农民冬季口粮困难。挖掘方法，采用分组分段包工制，全劳力每日可赚米六、七斤，鼓舞了河工情绪。迄今各县数十条渠道已整修完毕。各埝由两岸汇修之外埝，仅余两丈左右宽之水口。待广济埝合口后，即行合垄。预计去冬今春仍可浇地六十余万亩，以每亩最少增产二斗计，将可增产十二万石。
    【晋中电】晋中二、三分区正积极勘测与整修旧渠道，大力恢复水利。十月份以来，除祁县、平遥、介休沿汾河近百村农民与二分区清源、文水、交城等县协力兴修汾河水利外，同蒲铁路两侧各区村农民亦纷纷着手各项水利的恢复。太原战役第一阶段中，在“一面支前、一面生产”的口号下，榆次县复修官甲、万春、王村等四道水渠，各浇地七万余亩。介休洪山水利历年通过东河、西河、中河、架岭河四渠，灌溉着东乡五万四千亩土地（内有四千五百亩稻田），并打动百十盘水磨。介休碱地甚多，正发动组织群众准备今年打井，改变为稻田。太谷县勘测中之天顺、民生、萧河三渠，准备明春动工。仅天顺、民生两渠可浇地二万零四百余亩。祁县在恢复水田六万亩的计划中，除使汾河浇地由以往的二万五千亩增至三万亩以外，并着手乌马、昌源等河的水利工程准备。平遥县东南之沙河、东济河、亭岗、官沟等河，因多年淤塞，夏季多泛滥成灾，该县在整顿水利组织中，将过去专管汾河之水利局加以改造扩大，吸收东南沿叱河村庄参加组成两县水利委员会。与兴修汾河水利同时，对柳根、沙河等河亦开始测量。以上八河水利兴修后，两县八十七万四千余亩土地，将可有半数以上享到水利。至于复修中的经费建筑等困难，正在民办公助方针下商讨解决中。
