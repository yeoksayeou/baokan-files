Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 1st - The restoration and reconstruction work of Changchun Special City has achieved significant results in the two months since its liberation. Before the liberation of Changchun, under the brutal rule of the Kuomintang bandit army, which killed civilians to feed its troops, most of the citizens were without food and on the verge of death. After liberation, the democratic government first concentrated its efforts on relief work. In the past two months, the municipal government has issued relief grain three times, saving the affected people. According to incomplete statistics from the six districts in the city, a total of more than 752,700 jin of relief grain has been issued, benefiting 80,230 people. The relief grain issued to various government agencies, enterprises, and factories has not been included in these figures. Simultaneously with the relief efforts, the municipal government allocated a large amount of grain to organize disaster victims to demolish bandit bunkers and carry out sanitation work in the city through the method of "work for food." According to incomplete statistics from five districts including Zhonghua and Heshun, a total of 2,184 bunkers and pillboxes built by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were demolished. After the completion of the above work, various districts actively organized disaster victims to settle down and engage in production, introduced unemployed workers back to factories, and registered former employees. With the increasing activity in the Changchun market, refugees who fled Changchun City during the Chiang Kai-shek regime returned in droves. In just one month after liberation, the city's population increased from 120,000 to 300,000. The district governments actively helped refugees solve housing problems, introduced jobs, and helped them engage in production. In Zhonghua District, more than 3,000 refugee households participated in production. The restoration of the city's municipal services is also progressing rapidly. The Electricity Bureau has repaired more than a dozen main lines, accounting for half of the total, and restored 475,000 horsepower of electricity. The city's water plant has completed its initial restoration plan. The tram factory has repaired 20 kilometers of lines, and trams run smoothly on the streets. The telephone bureau has restored 1,900 telephones in the city. Most of the city's industry and commerce have also recovered. In addition to the public industrial and commercial enterprises that have resumed operations one after another, 626 private factories have started work, and 2,446 businesses have resumed operations. The city originally had 1,037 industrial and commercial enterprises, none of which were operating before liberation.

　　长春市正积极重建
  　市府拨大批食粮救济市民  公私营工商业已大部恢复
    【新华社长春一日电】长春特别市的恢复与重建工作自该市解放两月来已得到显著成绩。长春市解放前，在国民党匪军的杀民养兵的暴政下，市民大部绝粮，奄奄垂毙。解放后民主政府首先集中力量，进行救济工作。二个月来，市政府已先后发放三次救济粮食，拯救受灾人民。据市内六个区不完全统计，共发出救济粮七十五万二千七百多斤，有八万零二百三十人得到救济。其他发给各机关、企业、工厂的救济粮还没有计算在里面。与救济同时，市政府又拨大批粮食以以工代赈办法组织灾民平毁匪军碉堡和进行市内卫生工作。据中华、和顺等五个区的不完全统计，共拆毁了以前蒋匪所修建的碉堡、地堡二千一百八十四座。各区在上述工作结束以后，就积极进行组织灾难民安家、生产，介绍失业工人回厂及登记旧职员等工作。随着长春市面的日益活跃，蒋匪统治时期从长市逃出的难民就成群结队地回来。解放后仅一个月，全市人口就由十二万增加到三十万。各区政府积极帮助难民解决住房，介绍职业和帮助他们进行生产。在中华区就有三千余户难民参加了生产。该市市政方面的恢复工作也在迅速进行。电业局修好了占全数一半的十几条干线，恢复了四十七万五千匹马力的电力。该市的自来水厂，已完成了初期的恢复计划。电车厂修好了的线路达二十公里，电车畅行各街道。电话局共恢复市内电话一千九百台。市内工商业也大半恢复。除公营工商业已先后恢复外，私营工厂已开工的达六百二十六家，商业复业者达二千四百四十六家。该市原有工商业一千零三十七家，解放前无一开工。
