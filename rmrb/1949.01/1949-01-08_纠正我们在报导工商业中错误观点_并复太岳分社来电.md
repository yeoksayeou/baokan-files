　　Correcting Our Erroneous Views in Reporting on Industry and Commerce
    ——Also a Reply to a Telegram from the Taiyue Branch
    North China General Branch
    Last month, the Taiyue Branch telegraphed the General Branch, stating that it was unable to collect information on industry and commerce and that “even if some material is obtained, it can only be used for reference.” The above understanding exists to varying degrees in all branches and is a relatively common view, which contains an extremely serious matter of principle.
    From a historical development perspective, whether during the Anti-Japanese War or the People's Liberation War, we have resided in rural areas, mainly reporting on farmers, and we have achieved certain successes, creating our current consolidated position in rural areas. This is undoubtedly completely correct, but on the other hand, it is undeniable that we have shown detachment and even neglect towards the activities of the then smaller number of workers, whose role was not yet very significant. Our newspapers have never done enough to educate and guide workers' activities, reflect their voices, and consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants through our newspapers. This weakness has gradually been exposed with the rapidly developing victorious situation of our army. Currently, except for a few isolated Chiang Kai-shek bandit strongholds in North China, all our villages and cities have been liberated. We not only have agriculture but also industry. Regions like Taiyue, due to the lack of large industrial cities, may see agricultural production occupy a major position for a certain period, but this cannot lead to the conclusion that "there is no industry and commerce" or "industry should not be reported" (which of course includes workers in industrial production). According to the Taiyue Administrative Office's December survey materials, the coal and iron industries in Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qinshui, Yicheng, Gaoping, and other counties have greatly developed, with open-hearth furnaces and plow-iron furnaces increasing daily. The reason for the increase is that since our liberation of Luoyang and Xuzhou, sales have greatly increased, and merchants are scrambling to buy. The coal industry has also developed, such as the Jincheng De Taihe Coal Mine, which produces 120,000 catties of coal per day and is now preparing to use machinery for mining. These few facts prove that the past failure to pay attention to reporting on industry and workers is a problem of ideological understanding, not because there is objectively no industry or workers for us to report on.
    The reason why this phenomenon occurs, from a subjective point of view, is that news workers' class consciousness is not high, they do not clearly understand or even recognize that the proletariat is our main force, they neglect the leading role of workers, and forget the responsibilities that party newspaper news workers should fulfill to the working class. At the same time, it is also because they have long been accustomed to being confined to the rural environment, unable to see the developing, even if still small, industrial production and workers. This blindness and ambiguity of class viewpoints also exist in places that already have industry and workers. For example, the Shijiazhuang Branch did not consciously or systematically report on industrial workers for a long time after the city was liberated. We have recovered Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou for a long time, but readers have rarely seen the lives and activities of the nationally renowned industrial workers in that area. In the People's Daily and the General Branch itself, it is only recently, under the direct leadership and assistance of the General Office and the Central Bureau, that a change in understanding has begun. We request the Taiyue Branch and all branches, reporters and the vast number of correspondents, to re-examine this issue, thoroughly examine our past ideological errors and deviations, strengthen worker reporting, establish communication organizations in industrial departments and among workers, develop worker correspondents, enable worker correspondents to regularly reflect workers' lives and opinions, and truly play a supervisory and management role in industrial production. In terms of the proportion of articles used by local newspapers and sent to the General Branch, industrial production and worker reporting must be increased in a planned manner. Dispatch as many reporters as possible to go among the workers to engage in reporting. Reporters entering all newly liberated cities with industrial production must first visit workers, especially industrial workers, and reflect them with the greatest effort. After entering the city, reporters must integrate with the working class, so that the newspaper and the working class can be quickly and closely linked together.
    As for commercial reporting, it has also been neglected by various regions (including the North China General Branch and the People's Daily). Many comrades are "not interested" in reporting on commerce and still retain an old view of commerce. They do not understand the important role of state-owned trade and cooperatives in the new democratic construction of China, nor do they understand the benefits of strengthening the correct leadership of private merchants for developing economic production. They have shown paralysis towards the chaotic market phenomena and various speculative behaviors in some places, and have failed to promptly expose and criticize them to promote their correction. In our reporting on entering comprehensive construction, we must learn to report on commerce, so that the party's industrial and commercial policies are truly implemented in all economic sectors, and so that the newspaper is truly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood.
    The above opinions are specially brought to everyone's attention for study.

　　纠正我们在报导工商业中错误观点
    ——并复太岳分社来电
    华北总分社
    太岳分社上月二十六日曾致电总分社认为无法搜集工商业情况，并认为“即使得到一种材料亦仅可作参考”。上述认识在各个分社均或多或少地存在着，是一种较为普遍的看法，其中包含了一个极其严重的原则问题。
    从历史发展看，无论在抗日战争时期或是在人民解放战争时期，我们都是居住农村以农民为主要对象进行报导，我们是取得了一定成绩，造成了我们在农村现有的巩固阵地。这无疑是完全正确的，但在另一方面也是不可否认的，即我们对于当时数量较少、作用尚不十分显著的工人群众活动是表现了隔＠，以至于忽视。我们的报纸对于教育和指导工人活动，反映其呼声以及经过我们的报纸巩固工人与农民的联盟从来是做得不够的。这一弱点随着我军迅速发展的胜利形势而逐渐地暴露出来，目前华北除几个孤立的蒋匪据点外，我全部乡村和城市已在解放，我们不但有农业而且有工业，象太岳这样地区由于没有大的工业城市，农业生产在一定时期是要居于主要地位，但也并不能因而得出这样一个结论说：“没有什么工商业”、“可以不报导工业”（当然也就包括了工业生产中的工人），根据太岳行署十二月份调查材料，晋城、阳城、沁水、翼城、高平等县煤铁业均有很大发展，方炉、犁面炉日见增加，增加的原因则是由于我解放洛阳徐州后，销路大开，商人争购，煤业也有发展，如晋城德太和煤窑每日出炭十二万斤，现正准备用机器开采。这一点点事实即可证明了过去没有重视报导工业和工人是思想认识问题，而不是因为客观上没有工业和没有工人可供我们报导。
    这种现象之所以发生，从主观上来检讨，就是由于新闻工作者的阶级觉悟不高，不明确或甚至不认识无产阶级是我们的本队，忽视工人的领导作用，忘掉党报新闻工作者对于工人阶级应尽的职责。同时也是由于长期地习惯于以上被拘囿于农村环境，看不到日益发展的，哪怕数量还是微小的工业生产和工人。这种盲目性和阶级观点的模糊同样在既有工业又有工人的地方存在着。譬如石家庄分社从该市解放后很长时期没有有意识有计划地报导过产业工人，我们收复宣化张家口已经很久，读者至今仍很少看到全国著名的该地产业工人的生活和他们的活动，在人民日报和总分社本身也是最近在总社及中央局直接领导和帮助下才开始有认识上的转变。我们要求太岳分社及各个分社，记者及广大通讯员都来重新认识这一问题，彻底检查我们过去思想上的错误和偏差，加强工人报导，在工业部门及工人中建立通讯组织，发展工人通讯员，使工人通讯员能够经常地反映工人生活和意见，真正起工业生产的监督和管理作用。各地报纸用稿及对总分社发稿比重上必须有计划地增加工业生产和工人的报导。尽可能地派遣一部分记者到工人中去从事报导。进入一切新解放的有工业生产的城市的记者必须首先访问工人，特别是产业工人，用最大力量反映他们。记者进入城市后必须同工人阶级打成一片，使报纸同工人阶级能够迅速地密切连在一起。
    至于商业的报导，同样也是为各地（包括华北总分社及人民日报在内）所忽视，有很多同志对报导商业“不感兴趣”，对于商业仍保留了一种旧的看法，不了解在新民主主义构成中国营贸易以及合作社的重大作用，不了解加强私商的正确领导对于发展经济生产的好处，对某些地方市场混乱现象及各种投机行为则表现了麻痹，未予迅速揭发批评促其纠正。在我们进入全面建设的报导中，我们必须学会报导商业，使党的工商业政策真正贯彻在一切经济部门中去。使报纸同国计民生真正是利害相关。
    以上意见，特提请大家研究。
