　　Shijiazhuang Worker's Letter
  　Please Zhao Shuli to Write About Workers
To the Editor:
    Since the publication of Comrade Zhao Shuli's novel "Good Overcomes Evil" in the newspaper, the workers in our factory have been very willing to read it. Some workers who didn't read the newspaper in the past are now scrambling to read it. After seeing it for the first time, because the novel wasn't finished, the workers are anxiously asking: "Will it not be continued?" This all shows that Zhao Shuli writes well. However, recently we saw an article saying that "Good Overcomes Evil" is not good. Simultaneously with this critical article, there was also published an article saying that "Good Overcomes Evil" is good. One says it's good, one says it's not good, and then there are no more comments on it. Is it good or not? Please make a conclusion.
    In addition, Comrade Zhao Shuli is a famous people's writer, and we are willing to read his novels, but his works have never even mentioned the word "worker." Can he write something about workers? This is the demand of all of us workers.
    Salute!
　　　　　　　　Worker Wang Guanyi, Typesetter, Northern Printing Factory

### 石家庄工人来信　请赵树理写工人

　　石家庄工人来信
  　请赵树理写工人编辑同志：
    报纸上发表了赵树理同志的“邪不压正”一篇小说以来，我们厂里，工人们都非常愿意看，有过去不看报的工人，也抢着看了，当第一次看到后，因为小说还没有登载完，工人们都在焦急：“是不是不再续了呢？”这都是说明赵树理写的好，但是近来又看到一篇文章说“邪不压正”不好，和这篇批评的文章同时，还发表了一篇说“邪不压正”是好的文章。一个说好，一个说不好，以后再也不见评论这个了。到底是好还是不好，请作个结论。
    另外，赵树理同志是成名的人民作家，我们是愿意看他的小说，可是他的作品里连“工人”两个字都没有提过。他是不是能写一些工人的东西？这是我们工人大家的要求。
    敬礼  　　　　　　　　北方印刷厂排字工人汪贯一
