The Eastern National Democratic Movement is Rising High; US-British Imperialism is Terrified

Recently, news of the surging Eastern national democratic movement continues to filter through the layers of news blockade. The South Korean People's Armed Forces, opposing US imperialism and its lackey, the Lee Seung-man puppet government, continue to grow. Armed uprisings are frequently occurring in many parts of South Korea. Many officers and soldiers in the South Korean army who have revolted have repeatedly attacked the police in the southwestern provinces of Jeolla South and Jeolla North, inflicting heavy damage. They now hold the advantage in the aforementioned two regions. So far, the flames of guerrilla warfare of the South Korean people have spread throughout the southwest and southeast of South Korea. Alarmed by the South Korean people's armed struggle, the US military headquarters stationed in South Korea has dispatched a large number of US troops to join the South Korean police "suppression teams" in carrying out frantic repression, and has ordered its puppet government to purge and arbitrarily arrest "unstable elements." The persistent struggle of the Malayan People's Armed Forces and the broad support of the people for them have frightened the British colonial authorities in Malaya into hurriedly promulgating a "New Emergency Ordinance" on the 10th, announcing that any residents in the so-called "bandit-affected" areas will be arrested and deported. Its purpose is to try to clear the residents in the jungles in order to strangle the Malayan people's guerrillas. This "New Emergency Ordinance" contains a vicious conspiracy to harm our overseas Chinese and alienate the unity between Malays and overseas Chinese. It cunningly announced that no Malays would be arrested. Less than six hours after the ordinance was announced, 500 overseas Chinese were arrested in Kayang, south of Kuala Lumpur. In the Philippines, after the Quirino government, a US lackey, failed in its "peace" conspiracy to lure the People's Anti-Japanese Army into disarming in July last year, it launched a large-scale offensive against the People's Anti-Japanese Army in August and September. However, in the four months of war, the People's Anti-Japanese Army has not only not been "wiped out" as the puppet government boasted, but is growing stronger in the fighting. Since late December last year, the People's Anti-Japanese Army has launched a large-scale offensive from four provinces of Luzon against the US puppet government's army. On the 5th of this month, the People's Anti-Japanese Army attacked Lumbang in Laguna Province, the city of Haan in Rivai Sihai Province, and the city of Nozagalao in Bulacan Province, and once occupied the city of Wulani in Bataan Province.

The continued development of the Eastern national democratic movement, especially the approaching victory of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War, has terrified US and British imperialism. The Cleveland Plain Dealer, the mouthpiece of the US big bourgeoisie, exclaimed in its New Year's Day editorial that the sleeping tiger of Asia "has now awakened" and that "the United States must find a way to deal with it." In fact, so-called well-informed sources in Washington, representing the US government, clamored on the 2nd that "it has become necessary to establish a strong Southeast Asian group." With US participation, military delegations from Britain and Siam began a series of meetings in Siam earlier this month to urgently discuss a joint plan to deal with the people's guerrillas on the Siamese-Malayan border. By the 9th, "Britain and Siam had agreed that the British and Siamese land and air forces and police would coordinate their actions on the Siamese-Malayan border."

Two noteworthy events occurred in the United States in the past week. One was Truman's annual State of the Union address to the 81st new Congress on the 5th, and the other was Secretary of State Marshall's resignation and Acheson's succession as Secretary of State. These two events once again illustrate the outward strength but inner weakness of US imperialism and the serious setbacks its reactionary domestic and foreign policies have suffered. Truman could not hide his fear of the increasingly looming economic crisis in his address. He admitted that the United States "may at any time float or sink in postwar prosperity, until its demise." He believes that "in 1949 we entered a more difficult period of testing." Truman is very afraid of the American people's dissatisfaction with and opposition to his evil policies, so he had to hypocritically call for the abolition of the Taft-Hartley Act, propose the so-called expansion of social security legislation and the formulation of housing construction plans, etc., to deceive the people. When the US reactionary foreign policy implemented by Marshall was hitting walls and failing everywhere, Truman had to use Marshall as a scapegoat and accepted his resignation on the 7th, replacing this "military leader" with a low-profile civil servant, Acheson, which is tantamount to admitting the weakness of US imperialism. However, US imperialism will not give up its reactionary policies that have been constantly failing. Truman demanded in his address that taxes be increased by four billion US dollars, that universal military training be implemented, and that a strong armed force be maintained in order to step up its established policy of expanding its military and preparing for war.

Truman's "State of the Union Address" and the US's continuing reactionary policies have been resolutely opposed by the progressive people of the United States. The New York Daily Worker ruthlessly exposed and denounced the hypocrisy of Truman's address. The National Committee of the US Progressive Party held a meeting in New York under the slogan of "We need peace" and direct negotiations with the Soviet Union, condemning Truman's address and demanding the complete abolition of the Taft-Hartley Act. The Executive Committee of the Slavic Congress of America decided to organize demonstrations for peace in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and other places this month, insisting on demanding direct Soviet-American negotiations to resolve differences. More than 200 well-known American scientists, artists, writers, etc. jointly issued a notice opposing the US's Cold War policy, and scheduled a cultural and scientific conference to strive for world peace and rebuild Soviet-American understanding and cooperation on March 25.

Other important international events recently are as follows:

(1) The Greek Democratic Army launched a widespread offensive against the enemy throughout Greece. In a series of offensives, the Democratic Army achieved many victories and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. The city of Kerkes, north of Salonica, a large city in northern Greece, the city of Portidia, south of it, and many other towns and strongholds have been liberated by the Democratic Army.

(2) The Tito clique in Yugoslavia has openly turned to the imperialist camp. The Tito clique signed a 1949 exchange of goods agreement with Britain on December 27 last year. When negotiating with Britain, representatives of the Tito clique mentioned that they would conclude a commercial treaty with Italy and enter into a contract with the Marshall Plan. Students of the University of Belgrade recently published a letter to the democratic youth of the world, declaring their support for the Information Bureau's decision and opposing the Tito clique.

(3) After the Israeli army drove the Egyptian invading army out of the country in December, the invasion war launched by the Arab countries under the control of Britain and the United States in May last year suffered a disastrous defeat. Egypt has been forced to agree to a ceasefire on the 7th and agreed to direct negotiations between the two sides to resolve the dispute. However, British imperialism is preparing to carry out armed intervention against Israel in order to strangle the State of Israel.

### 东方民族民主运动正在高涨　美英帝国主义恐慌万状

专栏：国际一周

　　东方民族民主运动正在高涨
  　美英帝国主义恐慌万状
    最近，正在高涨中的东方民族民主运动的消息，仍通过新闻封锁的层层密网，不断传来。反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚傀儡政府的南朝鲜人民武装，正继续成长。南朝鲜不少地方频频发生武装起义。南朝鲜军队中的许多起义的官兵，近在西南部的全罗南道和全罗北道，接连向警察实行进攻，并予以重创。它们现在已在上述两地区占据了优势。至今为止，南朝鲜人民的游击战烽火，已遍及南朝鲜的西南和东南部。为南朝鲜人民武装斗争所吓慌了的驻南朝鲜美军司令部，已派遣大批美国军队，和南朝鲜警察“讨伐队”并肩实行疯狂的镇压；并命令其傀儡政府清洗和滥捕“不稳分子”。马来亚人民武装的坚持斗争，以及广大人民对它们的广泛支持，吓得马来亚英国殖民地当局慌忙于十日颁布“新紧急条例”，宣布对所谓“匪患”地区的任何居民，将加以逮捕和驱逐出境。其目的在于企图扫清丛林中的居民，以扼死马来亚人民的游击队。这个“新紧急条例”，包藏着残害我侨胞、离间马来人和华侨团结的恶毒阴谋，它狡猾地宣布对马来人将不加任何逮捕。在该条例宣布后不及六小时，吉隆坡以南的加央地方，即有五百华侨被捕走。在菲律宾，美国走狗季里诺政府在去年七月发动诱骗民抗军解除武装的“和平”阴谋失败后，即于八、九月间对民抗军实行了大进攻。但在这四个多月的战争中，民抗军不仅没有如傀儡政府所吹嘘的所谓“业已肃清”，而且正从战斗中壮大起来。从去年十二月下旬起，民抗军已由吕宋的四个省份向美国傀儡政府军大举出击。本月五日，民抗军曾袭击拉古纳省的鲁姆邦，进攻蕊瓦伊西哈省的哈恩城和布拉干省的诺查格拉奥城；并一度占领了巴坦省的窝拉尼城。
    东方民族民主运动的继续发展，特别是中国人民革命战争的接近胜利，使美英等帝国主义恐慌万状。美国大资产阶级的喉舌克利夫兰公论报元旦社论惊呼：亚洲这只睡眠状态中的老虎“现已觉醒”，“美国必须找寻一个应付的方法”，实际上代表美国政府的所谓华盛顿消息灵通人士，于二日叫嚣“成立一个强大的东南亚集团已成为必要。”在美国参与之下，英暹两国军事代表团于本月上旬开始在暹罗举行了一连串会议，紧急商讨共同对付暹马（马来亚）边境人民游击队的计划，会议至九日为止，“英暹双方已同意英暹两国陆空军及警察在暹马边境配合行动”。
    美国在一周来发生了两件值得注意的事情，其一是杜鲁门在五日向第八十一届新国会提出了一年一度的国情咨文，其二是国务卿马歇尔的辞职和艾奇逊的继任国务卿。这两件事再次说明了美帝国主义的外强中干，它的反动的内外政策已遭受了严重的挫败。杜鲁门在咨文中无法掩盖其对日益迫近的经济危机的恐惧，他承认美国“可能随时在战后的繁荣中浮沉，一直到它的破灭”。他认为“一九四九年我们进入了更艰难的考验时期”。杜鲁门十分害怕美国人民对其恶政的不满和反对，因此他在咨文中不能不虚伪地要求废止塔夫脱——哈特莱法，提出所谓扩大社会安全立法和制定房屋建筑计划等，借此哄骗人民。当由马歇尔所执行的美国反动的外交政策到处碰壁到处失败之时，杜鲁门不得不把马歇尔作为牺牲品，于七日接受了他的辞呈，用一个声望低微的文官艾奇逊来代替这位“军人派首脑”，这不啻自承了美国帝国主义的软弱。但是，美国帝国主义不会就此放弃其已经遭受不断失败的反动政策。杜鲁门在其咨文中要求增加税收四十亿美元，要求实行普遍军训和维持强大武装，以加紧其扩军备战的既定政策。
    杜鲁门的“国情咨文”和美国继续着的反动政策，遭受美国进步人民的坚决反对。纽约工人日报无情地揭发和斥责了杜鲁门咨文的虚伪性。美国进步党全国委员会在“我们需要和平”与直接和苏联谈判的口号下，在纽约举行会议，谴责杜鲁门咨文，并要求完全废除塔夫脱——哈特莱法。美籍斯拉夫人大会执委会决定于本月内在纽约、费城、芝加哥等地，组织争取和平的示威游行，坚持要求苏美直接谈判解决分歧。美国著名科学家、艺术家、作家等二百余人，联名发出启事，反对美国的冷战政策，并定于三月二十五日召开争取世界和平、重建美苏谅解与合作的文化科学会议。
    最近国际门其他重要事件如下：
    （一）希腊民主军在希腊全境对敌发动广泛攻势。在一连串的进攻中，民主军获得了许多胜利，予敌重创。希腊北部的大城萨罗尼加以北的克尔克斯城，以南的波蒂地亚等城，以及其他许多城镇据点，均为民主军所解放。
    （二）南斯拉夫铁托集团已公开投靠帝国主义阵营。铁托集团于去年十二月二十七日与英国签订了一九四九年换货协定。在与英国谈判时，铁托集团的代表们曾提到将与意国订立商约；并与马歇尔计划订立契约。贝尔格莱德大学学生近发表告全世界民主青年书，声明拥护情报局决定，反对铁托集团。
    （三）以色列国军于十二月间把埃及侵犯军逐出国境以后，已使在英美控制下的阿拉伯诸国于去年五月发动的侵略战争，遭受惨败。埃及已被迫同意于七日停战，并协议双方直接谈判解决争端。但英帝国主义正准备对以色列实行武装干涉，以扼死以色列国。
