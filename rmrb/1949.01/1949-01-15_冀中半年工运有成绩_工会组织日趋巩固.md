[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong General Trade Union has summarized the workers' movement in the entire region over the past six months, pointing out that since the Jizhong Industry and Commerce Conference in March, under the correct leadership of the District Party Committee and the active efforts of trade union cadres at all levels, the Jizhong workers' movement has achieved certain results: (1) Overcoming certain "leftist" adventurist tendencies in the past, and initially correcting excessively high wages, so that wage standards have been resolved in a more normal manner. In state-owned factories, most have implemented a comprehensive wage system based on real objects (rice) as the calculation standard. In private factories and workshops, most have implemented piece-rate, time-rate, progressive excess, and wage profit-sharing systems. (2) Expanded trade union organizations. In state-owned factories, most have established trade unions; factory directors and staff have also mostly joined trade unions. In private factories and workshops, according to statistics from Xinji, Hejian, Gaoyang, and Shulu four counties and cities, since the March meeting, membership has increased from 2,106 to 4,094. Trade unions at all levels have initially established systems for meetings, reporting, and paying membership dues, and have conducted investigations and research on master-apprentice relations and labor-capital relations. (3) In private factories and workshops, the policy of benefiting both labor and capital has been correctly implemented, so that the capitalists can make a profit, and at the same time, the workers' appropriate living standards are guaranteed. This has improved workers' enthusiasm for labor, increased production, and dispelled the concerns of some industrialists and businessmen.

Shortcomings and deviations in the work: (1) The Jizhong General Trade Union's leadership ideology has exhibited certain disorganized and undisciplined states, and it has not made systematic reports to the Party Committee for a long time. The cadres of the General Trade Union are mostly dispersed in their work, lacking leadership methods for grasping the overall work. For example, the March meeting in principle pointed out the opposition to leftist adventurism, but did not specifically point out new working methods to the lower levels, thus causing ideological confusion among some cadres, who were unable to handle problems effectively. (2) Trade unions at all levels are right to pay attention to developing production in their leadership ideology, but they have relaxed the education and learning of workers, and some places have even neglected the welfare of workers. At present, except for the staff and workers of state-owned factories who can persist in learning, there is a self-flowing phenomenon in most places. This has affected the improvement of the working class's awareness and the implementation of policies, making the labor-capital and master-apprentice relations in some places insufficiently coordinated. Some trade union cadres also have the idea of ​​underestimating learning. (3) In labor-capital relations, some industrialists and businessmen, under the pretext of "developing production," infringe upon workers' welfare and directly or indirectly restrict workers' political activities; some capitalists also deduct wages in disguised forms. For example, when the Xinyuan Iron Factory in the old city settled wages, it converted a worker's 100 jin of wage rice into cash and did not allow it to be spent. In the past six months, due to rising prices, 100 jin of millet was only worth 20 jin. In master-apprentice relations, the master's conservative thinking is still widespread, and individual illegal phenomena such as beating and scolding apprentices still exist; however, there are also apprentices who do not respect the master and do not follow the contract regulations, leaving the apprenticeship before the term expires.

Regarding future work, the summary proposes: The current priority should be to strengthen the education of workers and improve workers' class consciousness and policy understanding. In state-owned factories and enterprises and cooperative factories and enterprises, workers should be educated to establish the idea of ​​being masters of their own affairs. In private factories and enterprises, staff and workers should be educated to complete production plans on schedule, abide by the contracts signed by both labor and capital, and abide by the government's policy of protecting private industry and commerce. Continue to expand and consolidate trade union organizations. To this end, the following tasks must be done well: (1) Trade unions at all levels must attach importance to the learning of staff and workers, find a dedicated person (propaganda committee member or other committee member) to lead this work, and pay attention to supervision and inspection at any time. The learning method should be appropriately stipulated according to the specific situation. In larger state-owned factories and stores (20 people or more), the trade union and factory administration should jointly run spare-time schools. Scattered private workshops and shops can use small-teacher system to run scattered learning, based on trade union life groups. The content of learning should focus on the study of culture, technology and a certain class education. In order to strengthen the political understanding of staff and workers, the Jizhong General Trade Union has decided that each city should take half a day each month (which can be used flexibly) to conduct collective education. The education method can be used flexibly according to different industries and the distance of residence. (2) Continue to expand and consolidate trade union organizations. Cadres and members should always pay attention to educating and training workers, and those who meet the membership requirements can be admitted to the union after certain procedures. Except for individual elements with reactionary and destructive behavior to be washed away, the general ones should be patiently educated and transformed. (3) Several specific issues in the implementation of policies: A. If a worker is injured or sick due to work, the factory is responsible for treatment during the recuperation period. For general diseases, the factory is responsible for workers in the factory, and individuals are responsible after returning home. B. Wage issue: The current general wage is relatively reasonable, so the wage is still implemented according to the spirit of the March meeting. However, the past pure profit-sharing and the practice of gift-giving without fixed wages and purely monetary wages should be abolished, and attention should be paid to correcting the egalitarian tendency in wage issues at any time. C. Working hours: According to the spirit of the National Labor Conference, general factories can implement an eight-hour to ten-hour working system, which should not exceed twelve hours at most. Workers in handicraft industry, small workshops and shop assistants can be based on the old habits without affecting the health of workers and shop assistants. D. Workers participating in trade union meetings is a political right that workers should enjoy, and the capitalist cannot restrict it, but try not to affect production as much as possible during the meeting. It is stipulated that "February 7th, May 1st" and "October Revolution Anniversary" are the workers' commemorative festivals, and each is given one day off with wages paid as usual. For other festivals, the government laws and old habits should be followed. E. The apprenticeship period is generally no more than three years, and in the implementation, the length of the period can be determined according to the different industries and the difficulty of the technology. Appropriate consideration should be given to the degree of technological progress and work ability. Both the master and the apprentice should sign a contract, and the apprentice shall not drop out of school without reason, and the master shall not fail to teach halfway without reason.

### 冀中半年工运有成绩　工会组织日趋巩固

　　冀中半年工运有成绩
  　工会组织日趋巩固
    【冀中电】冀中总工会总结全区半年来的职工运动，指出：自三月冀中工商业会议以来，在区党委正确领导和各级工会干部的积极努力下，使冀中工运工作收到了一定成绩：（一）克服了过去某些“左”倾冒险主义的倾向，初步纠正了过高的工资，使工资标准得到了比较正常的解决。在公营工厂中，大部分实行了以实物（米）为计算标准的全面工资制，在私营工厂作坊中，大部分实行了计件计时，超额累进和工资分红等工资制度。（二）扩大了工会组织。在公营工厂中，大部分都建立了工会；工厂的厂长，职员也大部分参加了工会。在私营工厂、作坊中，据辛集、河间、高阳、束鹿四个县市的统计，三月会议以来，会员由两千一百零六名，增加到四千零九十四名。各级工会，初步树立了会议、汇报、缴纳会费等制度，进行了师徒关系与劳资关系的调查研究。（三）在私营工厂、作坊中，正确的贯彻了劳资两利的政策，使资方有利可图，同时也保障了工人适当的生活水平。这样提高了工人的劳动热忱，提高了生产，打破了部分工商业主的顾虑。
    工作中的缺点和偏向：（一）总工会领导思想上存在着某些无组织无纪律的状态，长期没向党委做有系统的报告。总工会干部多分散工作，缺乏掌握全面工作的领导方法。比如三月会议原则的指出反对左倾冒险主义，但没有更具体给下级指出新的工作方法，因此造成了某些干部的思想混乱，处理问题无从下手。（二）各级工会在领导思想上注意了发展生产是对的，但放松了工人的教育和学习，甚至有些地方忽视了工人的福利事业。目前除公营工厂的职工能坚持学习以外，大部分地方都有自流现象。这样就影响了工人阶级觉悟的提高和政策的贯彻，使有些地方的劳资、师徒关系不够协调。有些工会干部，也存在轻视学习的思想。（三）在劳资关系上，有的工商业主借口“发展生产”，侵害工人福利，直接或间接限制工人的政治活动；还有的资方变相克扣工资。如旧城信源铁工厂结算工资时，把一个工人的一百斤工资米折成款，不让支出。半年来因物价上升，一百斤小米只剩了二十斤。在师徒关系上，师傅的保守思想还普遍存在，个别的还有打骂徒弟的非法现象；但也有的徒弟不尊重师傅和不按契约规定，不等期满就出师的现象。
    关于对今后工作，总结中提出：当前首先应加强工人的教育，提高工人的阶级觉悟和政策认识。在公营工厂企业和合作社工厂企业中，应教育工人树立主人翁的思想。在私营工厂企业中，应教育职工按期完成生产计划，遵守劳资双方所订立的契约，遵守政府保护私人工商业的政策。继续扩大和巩固工会组织。为此就必须做好以下几项工作：（一）各级工会，必须重视职工的学习，找出专人（宣传委员或其他委员）领导这一工作，并随时注意督促检查。学习方式，要按具体情况适当规定。在较大的公营工厂、商店中（廿人以上），由工会和工厂行政共同办理业余学校。分散的私营作坊、店铺，可依工会生活小组为单位，用小先生制的法办分散学习。学习内容要着重文化、技术的学习和一定的阶级教育。为了加强职工的政治认识，冀中总工会决定：各城市每月抽出半天时间（可灵活运用）集体进行教育。教育方式可根据不同行业和住址远近灵活运用。（二）继续扩大与巩固工会组织。干部和会员要经常注意教育培养工人，够入会条件的，经过一定手续就可以吸收入会。除个别有反动、破坏行为的分子洗刷外，一般的应耐心教育改造。（三）贯彻政策的几个具体问题：甲、工人因做工受伤或有了疾病的，养伤养病期间由厂方负责治疗。一般的疾病，工人在工厂由厂方负责，回家后由个人负责。乙、工资问题：目前一般的工资是比较合理的，所以工资仍按三月会议精神执行。但应取消过去纯分红和没有固定工资的馈送及纯货币工资的办法，并随时注意纠正工资问题中的平均主义偏向。丙、工时问题：根据全国劳动会议精神，一般工厂可实行八小时至十小时的工作制度，最多不得超过十二小时。手工业、小作坊的工人和店铺的店员，在不影响工人、店员身体健康的原则下，可以根据旧有的习惯。丁、工人参加工会会议是工人应享受的政治权利，资方不能限制，但开会尽量不要影响生产。规定“二七、五一”“十月革命纪念节”为工人的纪念节日，各放假一天，工资照发。别的节日，要遵照政府法令和旧有习惯。戊、学徒年限一般不超过三年，执行中可根据行业的不同，技术的难易来规定期限的长短。技术进步程度和工作能力，应给以适当的照顾。师徒双方应订立契约，学徒不得无故退学，师傅不得无故中途不教。
