    △Belgian newspapers declare that an economic crisis has descended upon Belgium and is rapidly developing. The development of the economic crisis in textiles, leather, glass, shoes and socks, timber, tobacco, and other industries has led to reduced production and increased unemployment. According to reports from the Belgian Communist Party's newspaper, Red Flag, the number of unemployed has increased by 100,500 in the past three months. Official figures state that the total number of unemployed now stands at 230,000. The Red Flag claims that the source of the crisis lies in the continued influx of American goods into Belgium, which has caused unemployment and factory closures.
