　　Handan Mass Supply and Marketing Cooperative
　　Supply and Marketing Finds the Way
　　[Handan News] In the past, the mass supply and marketing cooperative did not integrate well with mass production. The management was relatively chaotic, and the masses were somewhat dissatisfied. Since the rectification at the end of October, the business methods of department stores have been corrected, and the policy of supplying production materials and helping to sell finished products has been clarified. In November, there has been a great change in work: for example, in the supply of industrial raw material cotton, it supplied cotton yarn of sixty bundles to local cotton weaving factories such as Qunhe (mass joint stock), Liqun (mass and merchant joint stock), Tongxing (family factory), cadre family production, and private small cotton weaving factories, Baojin, Jiuyi, Sihe, and Yongyi factories; as well as one weaving machine, worth a total of 6,595,000 yuan. In addition, it also supplied cotton yarn of forty-five bundles to Yangyi Wuhua Factory, Guangfu Work-Study Factory, and Linluoguan Factory around the city, worth 4,833,300 yuan.
　　In addition, in helping to sell finished products, it helped the family factory and private Zhixing Factory sell sixteen waist towels, two hundred and sixty-seven pairs of socks, six thousand five hundred and thirty-eight catties of printed cloth, and thread blankets. It helped Lihua and Li@ soap factories sell one hundred and eight bars of soap. There were also many instances of helping factories in neighboring counties to sell products, such as helping Yutai sell two hundred and forty-three towels, and helping Wu'an Hecun and Jinan Yarn Factory sell seven hundred and ninety-four bundles of cotton yarn. The above is just a start in supply and marketing work, and business needs to be further studied and transformed.

　　邯郸群众供销社
  　供销摸到门道
    【邯郸讯】群众供销社在过去没有很好结合了群众生产，经营上比较乱，群众有些不满。自十月底整顿后，纠正了百货商店的经营方式，明确了以供给生产原料和帮助推销成品为业务的方针，十一月份工作上，已有了很大转变：譬如在工业原料棉花的供给上，供给本市棉织工厂的有群合（群众集股）、利群（群众和商人集股）、同兴（家属工厂）、干部家属生产及私人的小棉织工厂、保晋、久益、四合、永益等工厂棉纱六十捆；还有织布机一个，共值洋六百五十九万五千元。另外还供给城周围的阳邑物华工厂、广府工读工厂、临洛关工厂等棉纱四十五捆，值洋四百八十三万三千元。
    另外在帮助推销生产成品上，给家属工厂和私人的志兴工厂推销腰巾十六条，袜子二百六十七双，花包布六千五百三十八斤，线毯田条，给利华、利＠肥皂厂推销了肥皂一百零八条，其他在帮助邻县工厂推销的也不少，象给裕泰推销毛巾二百四十三条，给武安和村和济南纱厂推销棉纱七百九十四捆等等。以上只是在供销工作上才摸到门路，在业务上还要继续研究改造。
