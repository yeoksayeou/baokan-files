　　On "Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil"
    Wang Qing
    Comrade Zhao Shuli's "Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil" has prompted two commentaries in the supplement of this newspaper on December 21st: one is Comrade Han Beisheng's "Thoughts and Suggestions After Reading 'Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil'," which considers the work "quite mature both politically and artistically" and a "very good work," and the other is Comrade Dang Ziqiang's "Impressions After Reading 'Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil'," which, on the contrary, believes that "the educational significance to readers is not great enough," and it is "almost like a 'Jingu Qiguan' (Strange Tales Old and New)." Here, I would like to briefly state my own opinions as a reader. Please criticize and correct any inappropriate, improper, or even erroneous views in the article.

    First of all, I believe that this work has practical significance for guiding the current land reform and party rectification movement. In terms of artistic achievement, the rich and skillful use of folk language in the article and the simple, natural, and beautiful style are fully demonstrated. However, I believe that "Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil" still has the following two flaws:

    The first is the ambiguity in the class viewpoint: Because the story opens with a scene of "too much bullying," which reflects the class struggle in the countryside. The "too much bullying" skill evokes the reader's enthusiasm and concern, but as the story develops, after a long four years, the class enemy—landlord Liu Xiyuan—is lightly dismissed with the words "died of anger," and his son Liu Zhong also disappears without saying goodbye. However, the author then seizes on a running dog—Xiao Dan—as the class enemy, painting his face with black ash, and letting him oppress and extort everywhere, causing the peasants to "point fingers behind his back," and "curse in a low voice," with "this one saying 'utterly bad'" and "that one saying 'a great scourge.'" What exactly is Xiao Dan's class status? The author does not explain clearly. But whether he is a lackey or an accomplice, he is ultimately a product of class society, with his roots planted in the class enemy. (Perhaps some people think: Xiao Dan's mischief is, of course, instructed by the landlord; it is understood without writing it out, as it is a well-known fact in the liberated areas. Yes, precisely because of this, for example, during the Soviet-German War, does anyone doubt that the victory was achieved due to the strong leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)? Does anyone doubt that the bravery of the Young Guards during the Soviet-German War was also due to the strong leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)? But this well-known fact was ignored by Fadeyev; the work "The Young Guard" was also criticized.) Based on this, the one who is truly "utterly bad" should not be characters like Xiao Dan, but the irreconcilable feudal rulers—the landlord class. If this is blurred, I feel it is inappropriate. The handling of Xiao Dan should be measured. However, at the end of the article, the "group leader of the work team" tells Xiao Dan: "Don't think you can always be an activist. Everyone in Xiahe Village recognizes your bones... Whatever punishment you deserve, you will receive it. That is your own doing, and you can't blame others!" The author thus pushes the entire "grievance" account of "too much bullying" to Xiao Dan, inappropriately allowing a running dog of unclear status to bear the entire criminal history of the class enemy. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the group leader of the work team, because he believes that Xiao Dan's "bones" are also "utterly bad," specifically points out: "Don't think you can always be an activist," thus fundamentally denying and abandoning the education and transformation of such a person. This view is also incorrect, because we can see from the work that Ju Cai, who is "forty or fifty years old," also "felt his chest lighten" after hearing Xiao Dan say "one honest word." This not only shows that there is no irreconcilable hatred between the peasants and Xiao Dan, but also that the fact that Xiao Dan can tell the "truth" signifies that he has begun to reform himself. Not only can clues for transformation be found in the original work, but also in the history of the liberated areas, it has been proven that countless characters like "Xiao Dan" have become active after transformation. Therefore, I believe that the author's treatment of Xiao Dan not only lets off the enemy and reverses the host and guest, diluting class hatred, but also is tinged with the color of "human nature theory," ignoring the party's educational power.

    Secondly, on the issue of the love between Ruan Ying and Xiao Bao, I basically agree with Comrade Dang Ziqiang's statement. The "love interest" of the "very tenacious" Ruan Ying "should indeed be an excellent Communist Party member, should be someone with backbone." But it is difficult for the reader to capture the true evidence of Xiao Bao's "excellence" from the positive side. It is only revealed from Ju Cai's mouth that Xiao Bao is an "activist" who "connects people in the east, connects people in the west, and shouts slogans better than anyone else." Compared with the "tenacious" Ruan Ying, Xiao Bao, who loves to "blush," seems as weak and mismatched as a willow tree on the banks of the Yellow River. The author lightly gives the seat that should have been used to portray Xiao Bao to characters such as Second Aunt, An Fa, and Gougou. (Not that these characters shouldn't exist, but they are written too much.) In the vast sea of tens of thousands of words, the few side profiles of Xiao Bao are like scattered islands, so vague, which weakens the persuasiveness of infecting readers and arousing resonance.

    The above is a little opinion on "Good Will Ultimately Triumph Over Evil." From this, it can be seen that I do not agree with Comrade Beisheng's view that it is "quite mature politically and artistically," but I disagree even more with Comrade Ziqiang's saying "Jingu Qiguan." In addition to the positive practical significance mentioned above, as a dissenting opinion, I think there is one more point worth mentioning: that is, the issue of Xiao Dan's "activist." Opening the original work, we can find that the first time Liu Xiyuan was struggled against was in 1943, when our army liberated the village and launched the rent reduction and interest rate reduction campaign. If we ask what Xiao Dan's reason for "becoming" an activist is, the era background is his only basis. History tells us that many people in the marginal areas have the idea of changing sides; in such areas, in order to mobilize the masses, in addition to the leadership of party members, cadres, and real activists, characters like Xiao Dan have the greatest chance of squeezing in to fish in troubled waters. Moreover, Xiao Dan himself "pinches his head to a point, and squeezes in wherever there is space." As for the temporary gains, it is expected, but can we conclude from this temporary phenomenon that the eyes of the masses are not bright? The last chapter of the original work makes a strong defense: Xiao Dan went everywhere looking for people to ask to join the poor peasant league, but few people paid attention to him. The facts negate Xiao Dan's "activism" and also confirm the truth that "the eyes of the masses are discerning." I think Comrade Ziqiang is somewhat guilty of blindly adhering to dogma when raising this issue. Otherwise, the "fake poor peasant league" incidents that occurred in individual villages during the land reform would be incomprehensible, because we cannot deny that the political consciousness of the masses is gradually improved through time.

### 关于“邪不压正”

　　关于“邪不压正”
    王青
    由于赵树理同志的一篇“邪不压正”，引出了十二月廿一日本报副刊上的两种评论：一篇是韩北生同志的“读‘邪不压正’后的感想与建议”，认为该作品“无论在政治上艺术上都是相当成熟的”“极好的作品”，另一篇是党自强同志的“‘邪不压正’读后感”，则相反的认为“对读者的教育意义不够大”象“一篇‘今古奇观’差不多”。在这里，我谨以读者的资格来简述一下自己的意见，文中不中肯、不恰当甚至误谬的见解，请同志们批评指正。
    首先我认为这一作品对指导当前的土改整党运动来讲是有现实意义的。在艺术的成就上讲，文中丰富而熟练地民间语言的运用，和文章底通俗，自然的优美风格，均表现得很充分。但我认为“邪不压正”还存在着以下两个缺陷：
    首先是表现在阶级观点上的含混：因为故事的开章就出现了“太欺人”的场面，侧面反映了农村中的阶级斗争。“太欺人”的本事、挑起了读者的热情关怀，但故事发展下去，经过了漫长的四个年头，阶级敌人——地主刘锡元却被轻轻地用“气死了”的话语带了过去，儿子刘忠也消声匿迹地不辞而去，而作者随抓住了个阶级敌人的却从走狗——小旦，把脸上涂满了黑灰，让他到处欺压敲榨，使得农民这个也“指脊背”，那个也“小声小气的骂”，“这个说‘坏透了’”，那个说“一大害”。到底小旦是什么成份呢？作者没交代清楚。但无论他是狗腿也罢，帮凶也罢，终究还是阶级社会的特产人物，根苗是插在阶级敌人身上的。（也许有人认为：小旦的胡作乱为，当然是地主的指示；不用写出也会知道，这是解放区人所共知的事实。是的，正因为如此，譬如苏德战争中，难道谁还怀疑是由于联共（波）党的坚强领导才取得胜利的事实吗？难道谁还怀疑在苏德战争中少共之所以如此英勇还不也是由于联共（波）党的坚强领导吗？但这一人所共知的事实，却被卡达耶夫忽视了；“青年近卫军”这一部作品也就受到了批评。）根据这个，所以真正“坏透了”的，不应该是小旦之流的人物，而是不可调协的封建统治者——地主阶级，如果模糊了这一点，我觉得是不应当的；对小旦的处理，应当是有分寸的。但文章结尾处，“工作团的小组长”却这样告诉小旦：“你不要以为你能永远当积极分子，在下河村谁也认得你的骨头……该着受什么处分，就受什么处分，那是你自作自受，怨不得别人！”作者就这样的把“太欺人”的一笔“怨”帐，全盘推给了小旦，轻重倒置地让一个成份不明的狗腿，承担了阶级敌人的全部罪恶史。这是一方面。另一方面，工作团的小组长因为认为小旦的“骨头”也是“坏透了”的，所以特别指出：“不要以为你能永远当积极分子”，这样就从根本上否定而且放弃了对这种人物的教育和改造，这种观点也是不正确的，因为我们可以从作品中看出“活了四五十岁”的聚财，听到小旦说了“一回老实话”，“肚子里的闷气”也“都散了”，这不但说明了农民与小旦之间存在着的并不是不可调解的仇恨；而且正由于小旦能说出“老实话”，这也就标志着他已经开始改造自己了，不仅可以从原作品中寻出了可以改造的端倪，就是在解放区的历史上，也证明了不知有多少个“小旦”似的人物，经过改造即变得积极起来。所以我认为作者这样处理小旦，不但是放松了敌人，倒置了宾主，冲淡了阶级仇恨，而且也渲染着“人性论”的色彩；漠视了党的教育力量。
    其次在软英与小宝的恋爱问题上，我基本上是同意党自强同志的说法的。“性格非常顽强”的软英的“恋爱对象”，的确“应当是优秀的共产党员，应当是有骨气的。”但读者却很难从正面捕捉到小宝“优秀”的真凭实据，只是从聚财口中透露出小宝是“东串连人，西串连人，喊口号一个顶几个的“积极分子”。爱“红脸”的小宝与“顽强”的软英相比较，只是滔滔黄水岸上的一株杨柳似的显得那么软弱，那么不相对衬。作者是把应当刻划小宝的席位，轻轻地让给了二姨、安发、狗狗等人物了。（不是说不应有这些人物，是写的多了一点。）在有着几万字的汪洋大海里，关于小宝的几个侧面构图，只象是零星散落的孤岛一样的瓢渺；这也就削减了感染读者引起共鸣的说服力。
    以上是对“邪不压正”的一点看法，从这里可以看出我是不同意北生同志的“政治上艺术上都是相当成熟的”观点了，但我更不同意自强同志的“今古奇观”的说法，除了上面所提到的积极现实意义，作为反对意见外，我觉得还有一点值得提出：即是关于小旦的“积极分子”问题。打开原作品可以找到：第一次斗争刘锡元的时间是一九四三年我军解放该村后发动减租减息的时候，假如问小旦“变”成积极分子的理由是什么？时代背景便是他唯一的基础。历史告诉我们知道：边沿区的不少群众，多少都带有变天思想的；在这种地区发动群众，除了党员、干部、和真正的积极分子领导斗争外，象小旦这种人物有最大的可能会躜进来混水捉鱼的。况且小旦本人又“把头捏的尖尖的，那里有空就跟那里躜”，至于暂时的得意是意料中的事情，但仅从这暂时的现象，是不是就会得出结论，认为群众的眼睛不亮了吧？原作品的最后一章中作了有力的辩护：小旦到处找人要求参加贫农团，但很少有人答理他了；事实否定了小旦的“积极”，而且也证实了“群众的眼睛是雪亮的”这一真理。我觉得自强同志在提出这一问题时，多少是犯了搬教条的嫌疑。否则，对土地改革中个别村所出现的“假贫农团”的事件，便是不可能理解的，因为我们不能否认：群众的政治觉悟，是通过了时间逐步提高的。
