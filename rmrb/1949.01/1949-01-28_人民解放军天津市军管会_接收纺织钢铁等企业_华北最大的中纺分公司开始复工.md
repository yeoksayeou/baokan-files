　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] The Tianjin Branch of the China Textile Construction Company, the Tianjin Second Branch of the Central Machinery Factory, and the North China Steel Company and other important enterprises have been officially taken over by personnel sent by the Tianjin Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army. The Tianjin Branch of China Textile has seven factories under its jurisdiction, with more than 22,000 workers and more than 322,800 spindles, accounting for nine-tenths of the 370,000 spindles in Tianjin, making it the largest textile company in North China. Among them, the Second and Third Factories, which have more than 100,000 spindles, officially resumed work on the 18th of this month after being taken over. Before the liberation of Tianjin, these two factories produced more than 44,000 pounds of cotton yarn and more than 120,300 pounds of cloth per day. The Seventh Factory of the Tianjin Branch of China Textile is the largest in scale, ranking second among textile factories in the country. In addition to cotton yarn weaving, the factory also has a wool weaving department and a printing and dyeing department. During the Tianjin battle, the 26th Division of the bandit army moved a large number of iron pipes, water pipes, iron plates and other materials from the factory to build bunkers and fortifications, and then bombarded them with artillery fire, causing considerable damage. In addition, all the equipment of the Tianjin Second Branch of the Central Machinery Factory and the North China Steel Company and its No. 1, 2, and 3 factories, formerly owned by the Kuomintang Resources Committee, were completely preserved thanks to the heroic protection of the workers of each factory. The workers of the Tianjin Second Branch of the Central Machinery Factory organized a factory protection team a month ago, taking turns guarding the factory every night, and all the workers guarded the materials during the day. The workers of the three steelmaking plants under the North China Steel Company also automatically organized factory protection pickets. On the 15th, the pickets of the First Factory disarmed a Chiang bandit soldier who broke into the factory. When the wall of the Third Factory was broken by artillery shells, the factory protection team immediately blocked it with bricks and wood to prevent fleeing bandits from entering.

　　人民解放军天津市军管会
  　接收纺织钢铁等企业
    华北最大的中纺分公司开始复工
    【新华社天津二十五日电】中国纺织建设公司天津分公司、中央机器厂天津第二分厂及华北钢铁公司等重要企业，已由人民解放军天津市军管会派员正式接收。中纺天津分公司下属七个厂，拥有工人两万二千余名，纱锭三十二万二千八百余枚，占津市纱锭总数三十七万枚的十分之九，为华北最大的纺织公司，其中占有十余万枚纱锭的第二、三两厂，在接收后，已于本月十八日正式复工。天津解放前，该两厂日产棉纱四万四千余磅，布十二万零三百余磅。中纺天津分公司七个厂中以第七厂规模最大，在全国纺织厂中居第二位。该厂除棉纱纺织外，并附有毛织部及印染部。在此次天津之战时，匪军二十六师将厂内大批铁管、水管、铁板等资材，搬去修筑碉堡工事，后复以炮火对之轰击，损害颇重。另前由国民党资委会所属的中央机器厂天津第二分厂和华北钢铁公司及其所属第一二三个厂所有设备，经各该厂工人英勇保卫，均告完整。中央机器厂天津第二分厂工人，在一个月前便组织了护厂团，每夜轮流守护工厂，白天全部工人看管资材。华北钢铁公司所属三个炼钢厂工人，亦自动组织起护厂纠察队。第一厂纠察队在十五日把闯入该厂的一个蒋匪士兵缴了械。第三厂护厂队在围墙被炮弹击破时，立即用砖木堵上，以防溃匪窜入。
