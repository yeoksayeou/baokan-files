To the Editor:

　　When our county began collecting public grain this year, the higher authorities repeatedly publicized that those who paid actively would be rewarded, and those who lagged behind would be criticized. As a result, those who paid actively did not see any rewards, and those who lagged behind not only did not receive criticism, but also benefited greatly from the rising grain prices. For example, when the collection began, the market price of rice was 120,000 yuan per dou (double market dou) of border currency, which was equivalent to 3,700 yuan per jin according to the market scale. Later, the price of rice rose to about 280,000 yuan per dou, but the government still collected at 3,700 yuan per jin. Calculated in this way, the difference between those who paid actively and those who lagged behind was about 160,000 yuan per dou. This has both dampened the enthusiasm of the masses who actively pay public grain, and caused losses to the public. The leadership has also lost credibility with the people. Therefore, in my opinion, the masses who actively pay public grain should be commended.

### 积极缴纳公粮群众应当受到政府表扬

　　积极缴纳公粮群众应当受到政府表扬编者同志：
    我县今年征收公粮开始时，上级一再宣传缴纳积极者奖励，落后者受批评。结果是缴纳积极者也未见奖励，落后者不但未受到批评，反而在粮价日益上涨的情形下，占了很大的便宜。譬如：开始征收时市场米价每斗（双市斗）边钞十二万元，市秤合每斤三千七百元，后来每斗米价涨至二十八万左右，政府仍按三千七百元一斤征收，这样算来，积极缴纳者与落后者相比每斗相差十六万元左右。一来打击了积极缴纳公粮的群众，二来公家吃亏。领导上也失信于人民。所以我的意见，对积极缴纳公粮的群众，应予以表扬。
