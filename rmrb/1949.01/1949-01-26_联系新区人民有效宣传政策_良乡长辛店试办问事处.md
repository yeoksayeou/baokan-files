Xinhua News Agency, Pingjiao, January 24th: To effectively connect with the people in newly liberated areas and promote policies, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has been piloting "Inquiry Offices" in Liangxiang County Town and Changxindian Town (the seat of Wanping County Government). These offices answer questions raised by people from all walks of life and have proven to be an effective method of connecting with the people of newly liberated cities and promoting various policies. Liangxiang County Town and Changxindian are both located on the Pinghan Railway Line. After their respective liberation in mid-December of last year, some workers, peasants, students, merchants, and other citizens in both places urgently requested to understand the various policies of the People's Government. Therefore, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army specially dispatched personnel to pilot Inquiry Offices in both locations, responsible for answering questions raised by the people. Since its establishment on the first of this month, the Liangxiang Inquiry Office has been visited by all kinds of people asking questions: workers asking about wage issues and rent issues; peasants asking about land burden methods and debt issues; students asking whether tuition and miscellaneous fees will still be charged in the future and what to do if they cannot afford to continue their studies; women asking how to dissolve unreasonable marriages; merchants asking whether they are allowed to sell foreign cloth in the old liberated areas. Some people even went to the Inquiry Office to complain about the oppression they had suffered from the old township chiefs and suggested that the People's Liberation Army work teams not stay in the homes of the old township chiefs, and secretly reported the black land concealed by the latter. Since its establishment on the 2nd, the Changxindian Inquiry Office has had one or two dozen people come to ask questions every day. The Inquiry Office posts wall newspapers, which include news from Xinhua News Agency, popular explanations of various policies, current affairs commentaries, and current affairs cartoons. The wall newspapers often attract crowds of viewers. For questions raised by the masses, these two Inquiry Offices only answer immediately if they are certain of the answer; if they are not certain, they will not answer for the time being, but will wait until they have studied the matter with relevant parties and then reply to the questioner by means of writing letters, publishing on wall newspapers or in newspapers. Some people have come to the Inquiry Office several times to inquire in order to thoroughly understand a question. After clarifying the industrial and commercial policies, some merchants immediately increased the goods on the shelves of their stores. Based on the information learned when answering questions, the Liangxiang Inquiry Office assisted the Chengnan District Government in understanding the phenomena of unfair public grain burdens in individual villages and the encirclement of a small number of work teams by old Baojia personnel, which prevented them from deeply connecting with the masses, enabling the district government to correct them in a timely manner. In addition to having dedicated personnel sitting and waiting to answer questions, the Changxindian Inquiry Office also dispatches personnel to go deep into the masses to carry out activities, such as teaching students to sing songs and talking with citizens, on the one hand answering their questions at any time, and on the other hand understanding their ideological conditions as a reference for the Inquiry Office to answer questions. The following principles must be paid attention to in this work:
	(1) There must be sufficient preparation in advance, and the questions that the masses may ask should be discussed to ensure that they are familiar with the policies, have a unified understanding, and provide consistent answers.
	(2) Maintain close contact with Party, government, military, cultural, educational, and economic organs. If you cannot answer the questions yourself, ask them to be responsible for answering them. For specific issues involving the actual measures of the local democratic government, ask the county and district for inquiries and discuss appropriate answers. And report the information learned, the demands and opinions of the masses to the local government on a daily basis.
	(3) The attitude should be sincere and the feelings should be genuine when answering questions. For doubts that exist in the minds of the masses but are not clearly expressed, they can be actively raised for explanation and education, but it should be concrete, vivid, and popular, with many examples and few technical terms, and avoid lengthy speeches.
	(4) Establish contact with the newspaper office and publicly answer questions of a mass nature in the newspaper.
	(5) Pay appropriate attention to maintaining state secrets and military secrets.

　　联系新区人民有效宣传政策
  　良乡长辛店试办问事处
    【新华社平郊二十四日电】人民解放军某部在良乡县城和长辛店镇（宛平县政府所在地）试办“问事处”，解答各阶层人民提出的疑难问题，证明是联系新解放城市人民及宣传各项政策的有效办法之一。良乡县城和长辛店均位于平汉线上。去年十二月中先后解放后，两地若干工人、农民、学生、商人及其他成份的市民迫切要求了解人民政府的各种政策，解放军某部因此特派专人在两地试办问事处，负责解答人民所提出的问题。良乡问事处本月一日成立以来，各种各样的人纷纷前来问事：工人问工资问题和房租问题；农民问土地负担办法和债务问题；学生问今后是否还收学费和杂费，升不起学怎么办；妇女问如何解除不合理的婚姻；商人问是否允许到老解放区贩卖洋布，有些人还向问事处申诉过去所受旧乡保长压迫的痛苦；密报后者隐瞒的黑地，并建议解放军的工作队不要住在旧乡保长的家里。长辛店问事处二日成立后，每天均有一二十人来问问题。问事处门前张贴壁报，内容是新华社的新闻和各种政策的通俗解释、时事解说、时事漫画等。壁报经常吸引着成群的观众。对于群众提出的问题，这两个问事处确有把握时才当时解答，没有把握的便暂不作答，等到和有关方面研究清楚后再用写信、在壁报或报纸上公布等方式答复提问题的人。有些人为了彻底弄清一个问题，曾好几次到问事处来询问。有些商人在弄清楚工商业政策后，立刻增加了店里的货架上的东西。根据解答问题时所了解的情况，良乡问事处协助城厢区政府了解了个别村庄公粮负担不公平和少数工作组被旧的保甲人员包围以致没有深入群众的现象，使区政府得以及时纠正。长辛店问事处除有专人坐待解答问题外，还派人深入群众中去活动，如教学生唱歌、和市民谈话等，一方面随时解答他们提出的问题，一方面了解他们的思想状况，作问事处解答问题的参考。此项工作必须注意下面几个原则：
    （一）事先要有充分准备，对群众可能提出询问的问题进行讨论，做到自己熟悉政策，认识统一，解答一致。
    （二）和党、政、军、文教、经济等机关密切联系，自己答不出的问题，请他们负责答复，涉及地方民主政府实际措施的具体问题，向县区提出询问，并商讨适当答案。并把了解的情况，群众的要求和意见逐日向当地政府汇报。
    （三）解答时态度要诚恳，感情要真实，对群众内心存在而未明确提出的疑问，可主动的提出，进行解释教育，但应具体生动、通俗，多举例子，少用名词术语，切忌长篇大论。
    （四）和报社取得联系，把带有群众性的问题在报上公开答复。
    （五）适当注意保守国家秘密和军事秘密。
