　　Rib Tuberculosis Needs Accurate Examination and Surgery to be Effective
Editor:
    We have a female comrade here who contracted bone tuberculosis (what the common people call "scrofula") above her breast ten months ago. It ruptured about two months ago. The Ministry of Health here couldn't treat it, nor could the North China Medical University. Now it constantly oozes pus, and a small piece of bone comes out with each dressing change. We are very worried. Please suggest a solution, or recommend a folk remedy, or recommend a place that can treat it!
　　　　　　(Zheng Wenju, Second Brigade, Military University)
    Comrade Zheng Wenju:
    The answers to your questions are as follows: Based on the condition and the course of the illness, we believe it is rib tuberculosis. In modern medicine, surgical removal of the diseased bone is considered the fundamental treatment. However, there are two conditions for this treatment: one is to determine the exact nature of the diseased bone and the extent of the diseased bone. This requires an X-ray to make an accurate diagnosis. The other issue is the surgery itself, which can be viewed from two aspects: one is the doctor's skill and equipment (which North China Medical University can solve), and the other is the patient's own health, whether they have other illnesses and whether they can withstand the surgery. Therefore, based on the above situation, we hope you will have another more detailed examination (at the Bethune International Peace Hospital, Department of Surgery) to determine the diagnosis and treatment method. As for whether folk remedies are effective, we cannot say for sure. However, in our experience, very few are cured by folk remedies, and it is easy to miss the opportunity for treatment. Therefore, we hope you will go to Peace Hospital again, and even if there is no way to treat it locally, they can tell you a treatment plan.

### 肋骨结核要检查确实然后开刀治疗才有效

　　肋骨结核要检查确实然后开刀治疗才有效编辑同志：
    我们这里有个女同志，十个月前在奶上边得了一种骨结核（老百姓叫老鼠疮），在前两个月左右破了，经本部卫生部不能治，又到华北医科大学也不能治，现经常流浓，换一次药掉一块小骨头。现在很为难，请给想个办法，或介绍个偏方或介绍个能治的地方为盼！　　　　　　（军大二大队郑文举）
    郑文举同志：
    你所问的问题，解答如次：根据病情及经过，我们认为是肋骨结核，在现在医学上认为施行手术、摘出病骨是根本的疗法；不过，行此疗法须有两个条件：一个是断定病骨究是何病及病骨的范围，这个问题是须要Ｘ光照像方能确确实实的下一断言；另一个问题，是手术的问题，这又可分做两面看法：一个是医生技术及设备问题（华北医大能解决），再者为病人本身在他部是否有病，及能否抵抗得住施行手术。所以，根据以上情形，希望再做一次较详细的检查（可到白求恩国际和平医院外科）一次，然后确定诊断及治疗方法。至于偏方能否有效，我们不敢断定；不过我们的经验，由偏方治好的很少，反而易失掉治疗机会，所以希望您再去和平医院一次，就是对局部没有办法也可以告诉你一个治疗的方针。
