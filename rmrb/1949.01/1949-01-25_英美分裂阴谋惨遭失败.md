Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Reports from various sources: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Executive Bureau meeting opened in Paris on the 17th. Participants included Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, representative of the French General Confederation of Labour, Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Ocampo, Secretary of the Latin American Labor Federation, Carey, representative of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations, Deakin, General Secretary of the British Trades Union Congress, and Kupers, representative of the Dutch Trade Union Federation. The meeting was chaired by Deakin, President of the WFTU. On the first day of the meeting, Deakin and Carey, who had long intended to split the WFTU, unreasonably proposed that the WFTU suspend its activities for one year, which was immediately met with strong opposition from Kuznetsov, Saillant, and Vittorio. Saillant declared that a small body like the Executive Bureau had no right to decide this issue, and that this issue should be decided by convening the Executive Committee and the Second Congress of the WFTU. Soviet representative Kuznetsov spoke on the second day of the meeting, supporting Saillant's opinion, namely that if the Executive Bureau ignored the opinions of the 67 national trade union central bodies affiliated with the WFTU and overstepped its authority to order a "suspension" of activities, this would be a totalitarian method. Kuznetsov stated: "Millions of workers are waiting for our help and guidance, and we refuse to be accomplices to those who want to abolish trade unions." Kuznetsov pointed out that the reason the American and British representatives "violently oppose holding the Second World Congress is because they fear their tricks will be exposed to all the workers." At the end of the meeting, when Deakin's proposal was about to be put to a vote, Deakin, knowing that his proposal would inevitably be defeated in the vote, requested a postponement until the 19th, and the second day's meeting was adjourned.

Deakin, who presided over the meeting, tried his best to restrict the speeches of representatives who did not agree with his views. On the second day of the meeting, he forbade Italian representative Vittorio from speaking, and on the third day, he attempted to prevent Chinese representative Liu Ningyi from speaking, which was met with opposition from the participants. At this point, Deakin, Carey, and their follower Kupers, whose attempt to split the WFTU had failed, became enraged and stormed out of the meeting, announcing that they were ceasing their cooperation within the WFTU.

The Executive Bureau meeting then elected Italian representative Vittorio as acting chairman and continued with the agenda. The meeting also adopted Saillant's proposal to convene an emergency meeting of the WFTU Executive Committee in Paris from the 28th to the 31st of this month. The meeting then discussed the preparations for convening the Second World Congress and approved the admission of trade unions from Chile, the Philippines, Siam, Southern Rhodesia, and Tunisia into the WFTU.

Note: The highest authority of the WFTU is the Congress. During the intersession of the Congress, the leading bodies of the WFTU are the Council and the Executive Committee, and the permanent leading body is the Executive Bureau.

　　英美分裂阴谋惨遭失败
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：世界职工联盟执行局会议于十七日在巴黎开幕。参加会议的有苏联职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫、中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一、法国总工会代表赛扬、意大利总工会总书记维特瑞奥、拉丁美洲劳工联盟书记奥康波、美国产业工会联合会代表加莱、英国职工大会总书记狄金、荷兰职工会代表库伯斯等。会议由世界工联主席狄金任主席。在会议的第一日，久已蓄意要分裂世界工联的狄金与加莱，即无理提出要求世界工联停止活动一年的建议，当即受到库兹涅佐夫、赛扬及维特瑞奥的坚决反对。赛扬宣称：象执行局这样一个小机构，无权决定这个问题，这一问题应召开执委会及世界工联第二次代表大会来决定。苏代表库兹涅佐夫于会议第二日发言，他支持赛扬的意见，即：如果执行局不顾世界工联所属六十七个全国职工会中央机构的意见，而越权下令“暂停”活动，这是极权主义的方法。库氏称：“千百万工人正等待着我们的帮助和指导，我们拒绝充当取消工联者的帮凶。”库氏指出：美英代表所以“要猛烈反对举行第二次世界代表大会，是因为恐怕他们的技俩被揭露在全体工人的面前。”会议结束时准备将狄金的建议提付表决，狄金知道他的建议将在表决中不可避免地遭受失败，乃要求延迟至十九日处理，第二日的会议遂告中断。
    主持会议的狄金，在会上极力限制不合他的心意的代表们发言。会议第二日时，他曾禁止意代表维特瑞奥发言，第三日时又企图禁止我国代表刘宁一发言，遂遭到与会者群起反对。至此，企图分裂世界工联业已失败的狄金、加莱及其追随者库伯斯，即恼羞成怒地退出会场，并宣布他们停止在世界工联中的合作。
    执行局会议随即选举意代表维特瑞奥为代理主席，继续进行议事日程。会议又通过赛扬的建议，于本月二十八日至三十一日在巴黎召开世界工联执委会的紧急会议。会议继即讨论召开第二次世界代表大会的筹备事宜，并通过接收智利、菲律宾、暹罗、南罗得西亚与突尼西亚职工会加入世界工联。
    按：世界工联的最高权力机关为代表大会，在大会闭幕期间，世界工联的领导机关为理事会与执行委员会，常设领导机关为执行局。
