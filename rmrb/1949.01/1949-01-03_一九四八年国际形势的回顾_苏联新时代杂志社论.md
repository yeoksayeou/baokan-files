A Review of the International Situation in 1948
Soviet New Times Magazine Editorial

The past year has been an eventful one in international affairs and in the domestic lives of individual countries. The past year marked a further division of forces active on the world stage. The democratic and anti-imperialist camp, led by the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, has continued to fight unyieldingly and steadfastly for lasting peace and the security of all countries. This has also been a struggle for genuine international cooperation based on mutual respect and equality, adherence to agreements reached, and recognition of the sovereignty of all countries, large and small. On the other hand, the anti-democratic and imperialist camp, led by the US-UK bloc, has continued to undermine the foundations of such international cooperation in order to sow fear and unrest around the world and to engage in conspiracies against peace and the security of all countries.

The events of 1948 definitively exposed the policies of the Western rulers. At the beginning of 1948, these countries launched a frenzied anti-Soviet slander campaign, signaled by the joint publication by the US, British, and French foreign ministries of fabricated and mendacious documents about the Second World War. The purpose of this slander campaign was fully exposed by the historical document "Falsifiers of History" published by the Soviet Information Bureau. A prominent event at the end of 1948 was the rejection by the US-UK bloc and its vassals in the United Nations General Assembly of the fair and just Soviet proposals to ban atomic weapons and disarm the great powers. This was an act of unparalleled shamelessness. In this situation, Stalin's words sent a serious, warning signal to the world: "The policy of the current leaders of the United States and Britain is a policy of aggression, a policy of launching a new war." This judgment resonated as a call to mobilize and organize all forces to support peace, exposing the true face of the instigators of a new war and tearing off the masks they often like to wear. This force supporting peace is boundless, and its activities guarantee that the evil conspiracies of the warmongers will end in shameful failure. Stalin's words expressed not only the belief of the Soviet people but also the thoughts of millions of people around the world. He said: "The horrors of the last war are still fresh in the memories of the people of all countries. The power of the masses of people who advocate peace is so strong for the Churchill disciples who engage in aggression that they cannot overcome this power and cannot turn this power to a new war."

There are reasons why the ruling groups in the United States and Britain are adopting an aggressive approach. The new pursuers of world hegemony, like their recent predecessors, are seeking to escape their internal difficulties in international adventures. The inherent evils of the capitalist system and the enormous contradictions tearing it apart have never been so clearly manifested as in these days. Driven by the fear of an inevitable economic crisis, American monopoly capitalists embarked on an unprecedented military build-up program in 1948. Goering's slogan "Guns instead of butter" has been revived in the United States. Swollen war budgets are lining the pockets of monopoly capitalists and causing increasing suffering to the working masses. This year's bumper harvest, which could have been a blessing under a rational social system, is another disaster for the United States and its big monopoly capitalist bosses. Finally, the Marshall Plan, touted as the main means of saving the US economy from threatened collapse, has not increased US exports as originally expected; on the contrary, it has not even changed the decline in exports.

In the third year after the end of World War II, Western European countries continue to struggle in a quagmire of contradictions and difficulties that have not been resolved. In some of these countries, industrial production has barely reached pre-war levels (the level of the crisis year of 1938), production has run into the narrow limits of market demand, and has already begun to decline. The rulers of Western European countries are proving the failure of their post-war plans. Having lost confidence in the possibility of economic recovery, they are seeking salvation in military build-up and military gambles.

One of the most dangerous gambles of the US-UK bloc is their policy in Germany. At the London split conference in February-June 1948, they adopted a course of completely breaking with the Potsdam decisions, abolishing the institutions of joint four-power control of Germany, dismembering Germany, and turning its western part into an economic and strategic base for US aggression in Europe. After the US-UK authorities carried out a separate currency reform in the Western occupation zones of Germany, they illegally issued the so-called Western Mark, thereby provoking an artificially created Berlin problem. Since then, this issue has been used as a tool to poison the international atmosphere. Because the US-UK bloc is pursuing goals in Germany that are fundamentally detrimental to the security of all countries, they are obstructing the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany, just as they are obstructing the preparation of a peace treaty with Japan.

In the United Nations, the United States, Britain, and their vassals are increasingly and blatantly violating the Charter of the United Nations, undermining the principles of the United Nations, and, with the help of their voting machines, passing illegal resolutions one after another. However, their actions only expose themselves as enemies of peace and isolate themselves in the eyes of the people. It is now beyond doubt that the so-called majority in the United Nations is completely different from the overwhelming majority of people in all countries who eagerly expect lasting peace and a rational solution to international problems in accordance with democratic principles. A rational solution to international problems in accordance with democratic principles is what the Soviet Union – the universally recognized leader of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp – is now striving for.

During this year, the democratic and anti-imperialist camp has been further consolidated. During this period, the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies made new and unparalleled contributions to promoting international peace and security. The Warsaw Declaration of the eight foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Albania was for this purpose. The Warsaw Declaration pointed out the only way to resolve the German question by following the interests and justice of the people. A sincere concern for peace guided all the activities of the representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies in the United Nations. We know that they are the so-called "minority" in the United Nations, but without this "minority," the voices of the overwhelming majority of the people would not be heard in the United Nations.

The treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance signed by the Soviet Union and its neighbors Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland in 1948 were, from the first line to the last, for the purpose of promoting peace in Europe. The Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, filled with confidence in their internal strength, are the determining factors for international peace and security.

The past year has more vividly demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist economic system over the dying capitalist system. The Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are confidently and rapidly expanding every sector of their economies. The Soviet Union's industrial production this year is 17 percent higher than the pre-war level of 1940, which lays a solid foundation for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. The total grain harvest reached the quantity of 1940. Moreover, this is happening in a country that has suffered such unparalleled damage caused by Nazi aggression. The currency reform and the abolition of rationing at the end of 1947 achieved remarkable results, actual wages more than doubled, and the material well-being of the working people is constantly rising. This is the result of the labor of people who have been liberated from exploitation, and their work is for the happiness of their country.

In the People's Democracies, which have firmly embarked on the road to socialism, the past year has also marked outstanding economic achievements. They have not only reached pre-war levels of industrial production, but in many cases have even exceeded them. In 1948, these countries witnessed further improvements in the planned economic system. Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, after successfully completing their first short-term national economic plans, have already formulated five-year economic development plans. The economic progress of the People's Democracies goes hand in hand with the improvement of the living standards of the workers. All these achievements have been achieved with the brotherly help of the Soviet Union. The relationship between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is a model of genuine cooperation based on equality between all parties, rejecting the domination of one country over another, and filled with full respect for the national sovereignty of all nations.

The past year has been a year of deep consolidation of the People's Democratic regimes in Eastern Europe. This year opened with Romania's declaration of a People's Republic. In this way, the Romanian people cleared the way for a brighter future. In February 1948, the Czechoslovak people, with a firm iron arm, stopped the attempts of domestic reactionaries and their foreign protectors to reverse the development of the republic. In June 1948, the decision of the Communist and Workers' Parties on the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia exposed the betrayal policy of the Tito group, which favored bourgeois nationalism, thereby bringing great harm to the Yugoslav people. The democratic camp firmly believes that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, with its internationalist traditions, will surely find its way back to the international family that is united against imperialism and upholds the cause of peace and democracy.

The main achievement of the working class and the general working people of the People's Democracies is the formation of unified workers' parties. The merger of the Communist and Socialist parties in Romania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia ended the division of the labor movement in these countries, a division that only served the reactionaries. At the end of 1948, Poland also formed a unified workers' party. The formation of a unified workers' class party, which truly conforms to the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, has therefore angered the right-wing Social Democrats in Western European countries, these running dogs of the bourgeoisie in the labor movement, who have used every means to prolong and expand the division of the working class. The consolidation of the ranks of the working class ultimately means the consolidation of the positions of democracy and socialism in the struggle for peace, the welfare of all countries, and against foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries. These domestic reactionaries are acting on the orders of foreign imperialists, and their resistance is becoming more violent as their inevitable fate approaches.

In general, these are the salient outlines of 1948. It irrefutably proves the continuous strengthening and consolidation of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp throughout the world. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the increase in the liberation struggles of the Asian people, who make up the majority of the world's population, and the heroic struggle of the Greek people against their oppressors all illustrate how inexhaustible the reserves of this camp are and how broad its foundation is among the masses. At the same time, it shows why all fighters for peace are deeply optimistic when looking to the future. No matter how hard the imperialists try to prop up the broken pillars on which their rule depends, they cannot stop the progress of history. However, the conspiracies of the instigators of a new war are cruel and ruthless, and these conspiracies undoubtedly endanger humanity. Only by raising the vigilance of peace-loving people can these conspiracies be defeated. The Soviet Union confidently stands at the forefront of the democratic and progressive forces—the defenders of the cause of peace.

The coming year must be a year of definitively exposing and isolating the enemies of peace and international security—the opponents of international cooperation on an equal footing. The coming year will undoubtedly bring new victories to the democratic socialist camp.

　　一九四八年国际形势的回顾
  　苏联新时代杂志社论
    过去的一年，是在国际事务上与个别国家国内生活上多事的一年。过去一年标志着活动于世界舞台上的力量的进一步分化。以苏联和人民民主国家为首的民主反帝国主义阵营，曾不屈不挠地、坚定不移地继续为持久和平与各国安全而斗争。这同时也是为在互相尊重与平等、信守已经达成的协定与承认一切大小国家主权的基础上的真诚国际合作而斗争。另一方面，以美英集团为首的反民主帝国主义阵营，则继续破坏这种国际合作的基础，以便在全世界散播惊恐和不安，并玩弄反对和平与各国安全的阴谋。
    一九四八年中的事件，确定地揭露了西方国家统治者的政策。一九四八年年初，这些国家发动了狂乱的反苏诽谤运动，这一运动的信号，是美国和英、法外交部联合发表的经过胡乱杜撰的、关于第二次世界大战时期的、说谎的文件。这一诽谤运动的目的，已被苏联情报局发表的历史文件——“历史的伪造者”所完全揭穿。一九四八年年底的突出事件，便是美英集团和它在联合国大会中的附庸们，否决了苏联提出的禁止原子武器和大国裁军的公平而正义的建议。这是一个无可比喻的无耻行动。在这种情形之下，斯大林的话向世界发出了严重的、警告的信号：“美英两国当前领袖们的政策，就是侵略的政策，发动新战争的政策。”这一判决象动员与组织一切力量来支持和平的号召一样响澈着，它揭开了新战争挑拨者的真面目，拆穿了他们常常喜欢戴起的假面具。这一支支持和平的力量是无穷无尽的，他们的活动，保证战争贩子的邪恶阴谋将以可耻的失败而告终。斯大林的话不仅表达了苏联人民的信念，也表达了世界各地千百万人民的思想。他说：“上次战争的惨象，各国人民的记忆犹新。主张和平的人民大众的力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔斗徒们来说，是如此的强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去。”
    美国与英国统治集团之所以采取侵略方针，并不是没有原因的。世界霸权的新追逐者，也和他们不久前的先辈一样，正在国际冒险中寻找逃脱他们内部困难的办法。资本主义制度固有的罪恶和撕裂资本主义制度的巨大矛盾，从来不曾象在我们这些日子中表现的这样鲜明。为不可避免的经济危机底恐惧所驱使的美国垄断资本家，在一九四八年采取了空前未有的军备建设计划。戈林那“大炮代替牛油”的口号，又在美国复活了。膨胀的战争预算，正在填塞着垄断资本家的腰包，并使劳动群众遭受日益增加的苦难。今年的丰收，若是在一个合理的社会制度之下，本来是可以成为幸福的，但对于美国和美国的垄断资本大老板，则又是一个灾祸。最后，被宣扬为从威胁着的崩溃中挽救美国经济之主要手段的马歇尔计划，并没有象原来所预期的增加美国输出，相反的，它甚至没有改变输出的下降。
    在世界大战结束后的第三年中，西欧国家继续在矛盾和困难的泥沼中挣扎，这些矛盾与困难并未获得解决。在这些国家中，有些国家的工业生产很少达到战前的水平（一九三八年危机年度的水平），生产碰着了市场需求的狭小界限，并且已经在开始下降。西欧国家的统治者，正在证明他们战后计划的失败。他们既然对经济复兴的可能性失去了信心，于是就在军备建设与军事赌博中寻求解救。
    美英集团最危险的赌博之一，就是他们在德国的政策。一九四八年二月至六月，他们在伦敦分裂会议上采取了这样的方针，即完全和波茨顿决定破裂，取消四国共同管制德国的机构，肢解德国并使其西部成为美国侵略欧洲的经济与战略基地。美英当局在德境西部占领区实行单独的货币改革之后，即非法发行了所谓西方马克，从而挑起了人工制造的柏林问题。自此以后，这个问题就被利用为毒害国际气氛的工具。由于美英集团在德国追求根本有损各国安全的目的，它们就在阻挠着准备对德和约，恰如它们在阻挠准备对日和约一样。
    在联合国中，美国、英国和它们的附庸们，越来越粗暴地公然违反联合国的宪章，败坏联合国的原则，并且在它们的表决机器帮助之下，接二连三的通过了非法决定。但是，它们的这种作法，反而日益暴露了它们自己是和平的敌人，并在人民心目中将自己孤立起来。现在已经毫无疑义，联合国中的所谓多数，与各国热烈地期望持久和平以及依照民主方针合理解决国际问题的占压倒多数的人民，完全是两回事。按照民主的方针合理地解决国际问题，这就是苏联——众所公认的民主反帝国主义阵营的领袖现正奋力以求的。
    在这一年里面，民主反帝国主义阵营，是更进一步巩固了。在这一时期中，苏联和人民民主国家对促进国际和平与安全作了新的无可比拟的贡献。苏、波、捷、南、保、罗、匈、阿八国外长的华沙宣言，即是为了这个目的。华沙宣言指出了遵循人民的利益与正义解决德国问题的唯一方法。对和平的真诚关切，引导着联合国中苏联与人民民主国家代表的全部活动。我们知道，它们是联合国中的所谓“少数”，但是，要不是有这个“少数”，联合国中就会听不到占压倒多数的人民的声音了。
    苏联和它的近邻罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和芬兰，在一九四八年签订的友好合作互助条约，从第一行字直到最末一行字，都是为了促成欧洲和平的。对自己内部实力充满了信心的苏联和人民民主国家，是国际和平与安全的决定因素。
    过去的一年，更加鲜明地证明了社会主义经济制度是无比地优于垂死的资本主义制度的。苏联和人民民主国家，正自信地迅速扩大其经济的每一部门。苏联今年的工业生产量，较战前一九四○年的水平高出百分之十七，这为提前完成五年计划奠定了稳固的基础。谷物的总收获量，达到了一九四○年的数量。而且，这还是在遭受过纳粹侵略所造成的如此无比损害的国家中的事情。一九四七年年底的货币改革和取消配给制，获得了显著的成果，实际工资增加了一倍以上，劳动人民的物质福利不停地上升。这是从剥削底下被解放了的人民的劳动所产生的结果，他们的劳作是为了自己国家的幸福。
    在坚定地跨上了通往社会主义的道路的人民民主国家中，过去的一年也同样标志着特出的经济成就。它们不仅达到了战前的工业生产水平，而且在许多场合，还超过了这一水平。在一九四八年中，这些国家目击着计划经济制度的进一步提高。捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚在胜利完成了第一个短期的国民经济计划之后，已经制订了五年经济发展计划。人民民主国家的经济进步，是与工人生活标准的改善齐头并进的。所有这一切成就，都是得到苏联兄弟般的帮助而达到的。苏联与人民民主国家间的关系，是在各方一律平等的基础上真正合作的模范，它摒弃了一个国家统治另一个国家，它充满着对一切民族之国家主权的充分尊重。
    过去的一年，是东欧人民民主政权深深巩固的一年。这一年随着罗马尼亚的宣告人民共和而揭开。这样，罗马尼亚人民就为更加光明的前途扫清了道路。在一九四八年的二月，捷克斯洛伐克人民用坚定的铁臂，制止了国内反动派及其国外保护人倒转共和国的发展的企图。在一九四八年的六月，共产党和工人党对南斯拉夫共产党情况的决定，揭露了铁托集团的背叛政策，这个集团左袒资产阶级的民族主义，从而给南斯拉夫人民带来了巨大的损害。民主阵营坚决相信：有着国际主义传统的南斯拉夫共产党，必定能找到回到团结地反对帝国主义、拥护和平与民主事业的国际大家庭的道路。
    人民民主国家的工人阶级和一般的劳动人民的主要成就，就是组成了统一的工人政党。罗马尼亚、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的共产党与社会党的合并，结束了这些国家劳工运动的分裂，这种分裂仅仅供反动派所利用。在一九四八年将要结束时，波兰也组成了统一工人党。统一的工人阶级正党的组成，确实符合马列主义不朽的学说，因而就激怒了西欧国家的右翼社会党人，这些资产阶级在劳工运动中的走狗们，曾用尽了一切方法延长与扩大工人阶级的分裂。工人阶级队伍的巩固，归根结蒂的意义，就是民主与社会主义在争取和平、各国福利及反对外国帝国主义者和国内反动分子的战斗中阵地的巩固。这些国内的反动分子，是依照国外帝国主义者的命令行动的，他们的抵抗，随着自己不可避免的命运的接近而更加猛烈。
    一般而言，这些就是一九四八年显著的轮廓。它不可置辩地证明了全世界民主反帝国主义阵营不间断的壮大和巩固。中国人民解放军的胜利，占地球上大部分人口的亚洲人民解放斗争的增涨，希腊人民反对压迫者的英雄斗争，在在说明着这个阵营拥有多么无穷尽的后备力量，它在群众中的基础是多么广大。同时，也说明了一切和平的斗士们为什么在展望未来时深为乐观。无论帝国主义者如何努力支撑他们统治所赖以维持的破碎支柱，他们是制止不了历史前进的。但是，新战争挑拨者的阴谋是残酷无情的，这种阴谋无疑地危害人类。只有爱好和平的人们提高警惕，才能击败这些阴谋。苏联自信地站在民主进步力量——和平事业的维护者的前列中迈进。
    今后的一年，必定是确定地揭穿与孤立和平与国际安全的敌人——平等基础上的国际合作的反对者的一年。今后的一年无疑地会给民主社会主义阵营带来新的胜利。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（按：本文根据塔斯社电讯稿）
