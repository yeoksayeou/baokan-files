Striving for the Red Flag
    A collective creation by the yarn factory workers, written by Xin Daming
    Characters:
    Qiaohua: A lazy seventeen-year-old female worker
    Kan Che Jia: A nineteen-year-old female worker
    Kan Che Yi: A fifteen-year-old female worker who loves to cry
    Luo Sha Female Workers: Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji
    Group Leader:
    Accountant:
    Opening:
    Qiaohua, Jia, Yi (Chorus)
    The motor hums and roars, the spinning frame spins and spins busily, the three sisters come to tend the machines, each with different thoughts.
    Jia, Yi:
    Victories are won every day on the front lines, production in the rear is busy day and night, we divide the machines to compete, to see who will win the red flag.
    Jia: No practicing knots, no runaways,
    Yi: The machines must always be clean,
    Jia: No dozing, strive to be a model worker,
    Yi: No absenteeism, we'll take the lead,
    Jia: Hands never idle in joining the thread,
    Yi: Less white waste, more yarn output.
    Qiao: Joining threads is such a bother, lean on the machine and play, as long as I hand in some half-spools, I can still meet the quota and earn my pay.
    Jia: Qiaohua, work harder, we can't fall behind, our sisters and this machine, must strive to be model workers, must take the lead.
    Qiao: Hmph! You strive to be model workers, you take the lead, even if production increases, it's not for us, what's the use of working more or less? Still just earn this little money.
    Jia: We're not doing it for money or silver, it's to support the front lines, to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, so we can have peace.
    Qiao: You worry about peace, anyway I earn money one day at a time, you do your production and support your front, this has nothing to do with me.
    Jia: You didn't see the general meeting. The meeting rewarded war preparation model workers, Factory Director Xia and Minister spoke, many people received awards of four hundred thousand.
    Qiao: They received awards, they're model workers, they have windows and eyes, how can we compare to them, such things won't be for us.
    Jia: Many people receive war preparation awards, do they all have windows and doors? This isn't the old society, whoever is proactive will succeed.
    Qiao: You be proactive, I'm just this kind of person, what's the use of being proactive, anyway I won't win the model worker flag.
    Yi: Looking at your lazy way, looking this way and that way, you don't even join the broken threads on the machine, leaning on the machine and swaying back and forth, the other machines all have red flags, the sisters are all happy, you're the only lazy one on our machine, preventing us from getting the flag.
    Qiao: Another one comes out of nowhere, what do you think you are? If you want to work, you go work, I'm just not proactive. (Aside) Is it your business?!
    (Yi cries, Jia pulls Yi away) Don't cry, ignore her!
    (The group leader blows the whistle)
    Jia: Hurry, don't cry, the yarn winders are coming, (Gets to the machine) (The yarn winders Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji run on) Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji chorus:
    When the whistle blows, we run forward, hurrying to the front of the machines. The group leader shakes down the machine, the sisters wind it row by row, the left hand pulls, the right hand secures, all six spindles are wound, after winding the yarn, put it on the line, quickly help the machine tenders, you help, I help, see who cleans the machine the most beautifully? Wind proactively and work harder, we sisters must also strive to be model workers
    (After winding, Bing and Ding help with the machines, Wu and Ji exit)
    (Bing sees Yi crying, asks)
    Bing: Why are you crying? Who yelled at you? Who said something to you?
    Yi: It's none of your business! I want to cry! (Cries again)
    Bing: (To B) Look at her crying, I don't know why, I asked her and she was rude, let's go and comfort her.
    Ding: Okay.
    Bing: What's wrong? What are you crying about? Did you quarrel with someone?
    Yi: I didn't quarrel with anyone.
    Ding: You didn't quarrel with anyone, what are you crying about?
    Yi: Qiaohua is lazy, I told her, and she scolded me harshly.
    Bing: Such a small thing is worth crying over, (To Ding) let's go and persuade Qiaohua.
    Ding: Don't cry, join the threads! (Goes to persuade Qiaohua).
    Bing, Ding sing: Qiaohua, you're really terrible, always being lazy and not wanting to be good, you don't accept suggestions, and make others angry, we two will go and persuade her, explain more and say less.
    Bing (To Qiao, sings)
    Qiaohua, did you quarrel with someone?
    Qiao: Nothing happened, don't make things up.
    Ding: Why is she crying again?
    Qiao: She likes to cry, who knows!
    Ding: Normally, she never cries.
    Qiao: If she wants to cry, who can stop her, she always likes to meddle, dissatisfied with everything, talking about this, talking about that, just showing off how proactive she is.
    Bing, Ding: They're advising you out of kindness, you shouldn't be rude, think carefully, whose production isn't better than yours? Everyone else's machines have red flags, why doesn't your machine have one?
    Qiao: I don't want one, why do you care.
    Bing: You can't talk like that, it prevents them from getting one too.
    Qiao: If they don't get one, they don't get one, they don't help me with the knots.
    Ding: (Aside) Why do you practice knots, nobody else practices, only you, you just stand there, the threads break and you don't join them, so you can practice knots!
    Qiao: How do you know I don't join the broken threads, did you see it?
    Bing: Of course I saw it! If I didn't see it would I dare say it, you're lazy, it's famous in the spinning department, everyone knows!
    Qiao: (Jumps up in anger)
    What's lazy about me? You're here to tend the machine for money, if they didn't pay you, you certainly wouldn't come!
    Ding: If I gave you my machine to tend, would you see that I was lazy? I'm lazy and I don't have to give you my machine to tend!
    Bing: Enough, enough, don't argue, let's go, ignore her! (Exits)
    Qiao: (Points at their backs)
    Look at your enthusiasm, what do you think you're doing! Muttering and grumbling, you still want to control people? What are you good for!?
    Uh, they're gone, I still have some white waste, better go throw it away!
    (Throws it into another machine) (Wu and Ding enter, see it.)
    Wu: The group leader is here! What are you doing?
    Qiao: I'm not doing anything.
    Wu: What are you standing here for? (Shouts) Group leader. Come quick! Come quick! She's throwing white waste here.
    Group: Who's throwing white waste?
    Wu: (Points to Qiao) Her!
    Group: Why are you throwing white waste?
    Qiao: I didn't throw anything, she's slandering me!
    Wu: Who's slandering you! Why would we slander you? Isn't this a wad of white waste!
    Qiao: Who knows who threw it, I was just looking around, and you say I threw it! What time was it, what year, what month? What moment?
    Wu: Just now, just now, just now.……
    (The accountant enters with half-spools)
    Acc: Look at what they're up to, so many half-spools in their pockets.
    Group: Whose machine are they from? Did you deduct their weight?
    Acc: They're from machine number five, I deducted three pounds.
    Qiao: That didn't happen, I never had spools on my machine.
    Acc: Never had spools? Would I take a handful of half-spools from another machine and put them in your pocket? What would I gain from deducting your points?
    Group: Don't argue, let's have a review meeting and talk about it later. (Exits)
    (Blows the whistle to call a meeting, Acc, Bing, Ding exit)
    Jia: Hmph! Not proactive! And causing trouble!
    Yi: This time you're definitely labeled "backward."
    Jia: Needs to be reviewed! If it isn't reviewed, what will this become!
    Group: Raises a sign, which reads:
    "Fine spinning department machine tender Qiaohua, not proactive in production, but throwing white waste, handing in half-spools, given a warning, deduct three points. Fine Spinning Department"
    Group: The sun in the liberated area is red and bright, the news of victory never stops, we divide the machines to compete, everyone actively responds, only Qiaohua, sabotages production and spouts nonsense, now we criticize with a sign, to see if she improves, if she improves, we will exempt her, and even praise her, if she makes an extra effort, it won't be difficult for her to strive to be a model worker.
    (Hangs the sign, exits)
    Qiao: (Exits crying)
    Jia: Look at her crying, let's go and comfort her!
    Yi: Okay!
    Jia, Yi: Qiaohua, don't be sad, everyone makes mistakes, didn't you hear the group leader say, if you're proactive in production you can be exempted, let's unite, you lead me, I lead you, let's work hard, we must strive to be model workers.
    Qiao: Receiving criticism, everyone says, Qiaohua is very sad, other machines have red flags, the sisters are all happy, only my production doesn't get any, being criticized is very embarrassing, if I work hard I will work hard, but I don't think I can be a model worker!
    Jia, Yi: Tell Qiaohua not to be discouraged, the group leader's words were clear, as long as we work hard, we will definitely be model workers.
    Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji enter singing:
    After winding the yarn, come help with the machines, sisters must work together in unity.
    Jia, Yi: Unite, everyone works, no one slacks off.
    Qiao: Receiving criticism, not discouraged, quickly correct my mistakes and strive for the red flag.
    All sing: Single-mindedly work harder, happily working, you work, I work, we sisters single-mindedly strive to be model workers.
    (Everyone works diligently)
    (The group leader enters with a red flag)
    Group sings: Machine number five, with one heart, everyone is working really hard, no absenteeism or breaks, the machines are very clean, all according to the work standards, the quality of the yarn output isn't bad either, not discouraged after receiving criticism, the production attitude is very serious, the score is high and deserves praise, the red flag is placed on the machine.
    All:
            (I)
    The red flag is red, placed on the machine head, the words "model worker" are embroidered on the flag, the model flag shines brightly, the sisters all love it, love it, like it, we got it because we worked proactively, got it and placed it on the machine head, everyone praises the model worker.
            (II)
    The red flag is red, so beautiful, the sisters' hands don't rest, the hands don't rest, work harder, eliminate empty spindles and increase yarn output, join the threads more, don't let the threads break, don't practice knots on the machine, the sisters are united with one heart, only unity can win the model flag.
            (III)
    Getting the red flag, so happy, the red flag flutters beautifully, we are glorious laborers, we are fighters building the factory, strive to be model workers, increase production, improve quality, support the front lines, defeat Chiang Kai-shek sooner, everyone can enjoy peace sooner.

　　争红旗
    纱厂工人集体创作辛大明执笔
    人物：
    巧花：十七岁女工偷懒
    看车甲：十九岁女工
    看车乙：十五岁女工爱哭
    络纱女工：丙丁戊己
    组长：
    司帐：开幕：
    巧花、甲、乙（合唱）
    马达轰隆轰隆隆响，细纱车转呀转的个忙，姐妹三人来看车，各人的心思不一样。
    甲、乙：
    前方天天打胜仗，后方生产日夜忙，我们分车来竞赛，看看红旗谁得上。
    甲：不练疙疸不跑车，
    乙：车上常常要清洁，
    甲：不打瞌睡争模范，
    乙：不旷工来咱占先，
    甲：上线接头手不闲，
    乙：少出白花多出线。
    巧：看车接头真麻烦，靠在车头玩一玩，只要提几个半截穗，一样出数挣工钱。
    甲：巧花妹妹快加油干，我们不能落后边，咱们姐妹这台车，要争模范要占先。
    巧：哼！你争模范你占先，生产多了不给咱，干多干少有什么用？还不是挣这几个钱。
    甲：咱不为银子不为钱，为的就是支援前线，早日打垮蒋介石，咱们才得有平安。
    巧：你管他平安不平安，反正干一天挣一天钱，你生你的产来你支你的前，这事与我没有相干。
    甲：开大会你没看见。会上奖励备战模范，厂长夏部长讲了话，好多人得奖四十万。
    巧：人家得奖人家模范，人家有窗子人家有眼，怎么能和人家比，这样的事情轮不着咱。
    甲：备战得奖有许多人，都有窗子都有门？现在不是旧社会，只要谁积极谁就行。
    巧：你要积极你积极，我这人就是这脾气，咱积极来有什么用，反正又得不上模范旗。
    乙：照你这个懒样样，东张张来西望望，车上断头也不接，靠在车上来回幌，别人车上都插口红旗，姐姐妹妹喜洋洋，咱车就你个懒东西，碍得咱们也插不上。
    巧：平空又出来了一个你，你算是个什么东西？你要干来你去干，我就是这样不积极。（白）你管得着我啦！
    （乙气的哭了，甲拉乙走）别哭了，理他干吗？
    （组长吹哨）
    甲：快别哭了，络纱的来了，（上车了）（络纱的丙、丁、戊、己、跑上）丙丁戊己合唱：
    一吹哨，往前跑，急忙跑到车前了。组长把车摇下来，姐妹们一排排络起来，左手拔来右手安，六根毛棍都络完，络完纱来把线上，赶紧又帮看车的忙，你也帮来我也帮，看谁清洁车最漂亮？积极络来加油干，咱姐妹也要争模范
    （络完后，丙丁帮车，戊己下）
    （丙见乙哭，问）
    丙：你为什么哭？谁嚷你啦？谁说你啦？
    乙：你管我呢？我愿意哭！（又哭）
    丙：（向Ｂ）你看他哭起来了，不知为什么我问他他还没好气，咱俩去劝劝他。
    丁：好。
    丙：你怎么啦？哭什么哩？跟谁闹意见呢？
    乙：我没和谁闹意见。
    丁：没和谁闹意见，你哭什么哩？
    乙：巧花偷懒，我说他，他恶声恶气的骂我。
    丙：这么点小事也值当的哭，（向丁）我们俩人去劝劝巧花去。
    丁：你快不要哭了，快接头吧！（去劝巧花）。
    丙丁唱：巧花算你真糟糕，天天偷懒不要好，给提意见不接受，倒把人家气哭了，咱们两人去劝他，多给解释少说他。
    丙（向巧，唱）
    巧花你给人家闹意见？
    巧：没有的事儿不要胡编。
    丁：怎么他又哭开了？
    巧：他这人爱哭谁知道！
    丁：好好的，他怎么也不哭。
    巧：他要哭谁能挡的住，他一天老爱管闲事，看见什么也不满意，说说这个，道道那个，就显他一个人才积极。
    丙丁：人家劝你是好意，不应该给人家耍脾气，自己仔细想一想，那个生产不比你强？人家车上都插红旗，为什么你车插不上？
    巧：我插不上我愿意，何必你们瞎主张。
    丙：这话不能这样讲，耽误他俩也插不上。
    巧：插不上就插不上，我练疙疸他们不帮忙。
    丁：（白）为什么你练疙疸，人家都不练就你练，你光站着，头断了不接，你凑练疙疸呀！
    巧：你怎么知道我头断了不接，你看见来？
    丙：当然是看见啦！不看见我就敢说你啦，你这个懒，在细纱部出了名啦，谁不知道！
    巧：（气的蹦起来）
    我什么懒啦？你看车是为挣钱来了，人家不给你钱你保险不来啦！
    丁：你给我看车，你看见那儿懒啦？我懒我没给你看车！
    丙：算了，算了，别吵了，走呀，别管他了！（下）
    巧：（指两人背后）
    看你那股劲，你算干什么的呀！穷嘟嘟嚷嚷，你还想管人呢？你算干什么吃的！？
    呃，他们走远了，我还有点白花哩，快去扔了吧！
    （扔到别的车）（正往箱内扔，戊、丁上，看见了。）
    戊：组长来哩！你干什么？
    巧：我没干什么。
    戊：你在这里立着干什么？（喊）组长。快来！快来！他在这扔白花哩。
    组：谁扔白花哩？
    戊：（指巧）他！
    组：为什么你扔白花呀！
    巧：我那里扔啦，他诬赖人！
    戊：谁诬赖你！我们为什么诬赖你？这不是这一团白花呀！
    巧：那不定是谁扔的，我在这里看了看，说我扔的！是什么时候，那年那月？那个时刻？
    戊：刚才，刚才，刚才。……
    （司帐拿半截穗上）
    司：你看看他们捣的鬼，搁口袋里这么些半截穗。
    组：是谁车上的？给他扣了磅没有。
    司：是五号车上的，给扣了三磅。
    巧：那有那回事，我车上就没提过穗。
    司：没提过穗？我还到旁的车上拿一把半截穗搁到你口袋里？扣了你的分与我有什么相干？
    组：别吵了，咱们开个检讨会再说。（下）
    （吹哨叫开会，司、丙、丁下）
    甲：哼！不积极吧！还捣鬼！
    乙：这一下可背定“落后”了。
    甲：该检讨！再不检讨，这成了个什么样了！
    组：提牌上，上写：
    “细纱部看车工巧花，不积极生产，反而扔白花，提半截穗，给予批评一次，扣三分。细纱部”
    组：解放区的太阳红又红，胜利的消息永不停，我们分车来竞赛，大家都积极来响应，惟有巧花这个人，生产捣鬼胡支应，现在出牌来批评，看看他以后好不好，如果好来把过免，并且还要受表扬，如果再努一把劲，争取模范他不难。
    （挂牌后，下）
    巧：（哭下）
    甲：你看他哭开了，咱们去劝劝他吧！
    乙：好！
    甲乙：巧花你心里不要难过，那一个身上没有点错，你没听见组长说，积极生产能免过，咱们三人团结起，你带我来我带你，咱们三人好好干，一定要争取作模范。
    巧：受处分大伙儿说，巧花心里好难过，别人车上挂红旗，姐妹们个个心欢喜，惟我生产就不沾，受人批评多难看，积极干就积极干，我看积极也得不上模范！
    甲乙：叫巧花不要灰心，组长的话儿说的清，只要咱们积极干，咱们一定会得模范。
    丙丁戊己上唱：
    络完纱，来帮车，姐妹们干活要团结。
    甲乙：团结起，大伙干，谁也加劲不偷懒。
    巧：受批评，不灰心，赶快改过把红旗争。
    全体唱：一心努力加油干，干起活来心喜欢，你也干来我也干，咱姐妹一心争模范。
    （大家紧张工作）
    （组长拿红旗上）
    组唱：五号车，一条心，大伙儿干的真起劲，没有旷工和歇工，车上清洁的很干净，都按着工作标准法，出纱的质量也不差，受了批评不灰心，生产态度顶认真，得分多来该表扬，红旗插在车头上。
    全体：
    　　　　（一）
    红旗红，车头插，模范的字儿旗上扎，模范旗帜放光华，姐妹们个个喜爱它，喜爱它，欢喜它，积极工作得了它，得了它来车头插，工作模范人人夸。
    　　　　（二）
    红旗红，真好看，姐妹工作手不闲，手不闲来加油干，消灭空锭多出线，多接头来头不断，车上不把疙疸练，姐妹们团结一条心，团结才能争模范。
    　　　　（三）
    得红旗，真喜欢，红飘飘真好看，我们是光荣的劳动者，是建设工厂的战斗员，争模范，多生产，提高质量，支援前线，早一天打垮蒋介石，大家早一天享平安。
