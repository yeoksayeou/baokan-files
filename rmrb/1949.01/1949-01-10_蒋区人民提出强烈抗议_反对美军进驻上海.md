Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. The U.S. imperialist's aggressive act of dispatching Marines into Shanghai has aroused strong protests from the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Shanghai Student Union issued a statement on December 25th of last year, severely condemning this action by the United States as "an act of aggression that damages Chinese sovereignty" and "a military interference in China's internal affairs." The statement declared: "As the young generation of China, the Shanghai students will resolutely oppose this action by the United States to the end." Hong Kong's democratic parties also jointly issued a statement in mid-December of last year, severely condemning the U.S. aggressive act of stationing Marines in Shanghai and other places under the pretext of protecting American expatriates.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. The Kuomintang bandit gang is planning to further sell out Taiwan as an American base of aggression in the Far East. According to a report by the United Press on the 3rd, quoting the London Times, Kuomintang bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek "has secretly proposed handing over the Taiwan base to MacArthur's command." Prior to this, Salisbury, the New York Times' diplomatic correspondent in Paris, quoted "responsible diplomatic sources in Paris confirming a piece of news" on December 4th of last year, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek has proposed to the United States that the United States has the right to have military bases in Taiwan in exchange for American aid to the Kuomintang army."

　　蒋区人民提出强烈抗议
  　反对美军进驻上海
    【新华社陕北七日电】美帝国主义派遣海军陆战队进入上海的侵略行动，引起国民党统治区人民的强烈抗议。上海学生联合会于去年十二月二十五日发表声明，严斥美国此一行动是“损害中国主权的侵略行为”，是“对中国内政的军事干涉”。声明宣称：“作为中国的年青一代，上海学生将坚决反对美国这一行动到底。”香港各民主党派亦于去年十二月中旬联合发表声明，严斥美国借口保护美侨而在上海等地派驻海军陆战队的侵略行为。
    【新华社陕北七日电】国民党匪帮正打算进一步出卖台湾，作为美国在远东的侵略基地。据合众社三日电引伦敦太阳时报消息透露：国民党匪首蒋介石“已秘密提议将台湾基地交由麦克阿瑟统辖”。在此以前，纽约时报驻巴黎外交记者萨尔兹伯格曾于去年十二月四日引证巴黎“负责的外交人士证实的一项消息”说：“蒋介石已向美国提出美国在台湾有军事基地之权，以换取美国对国民党军之援助。”
