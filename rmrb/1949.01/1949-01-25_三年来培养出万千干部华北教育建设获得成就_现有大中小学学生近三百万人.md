　　North China's education can be divided into three parts: university education, primary and secondary school education, and social education. In the past three years, significant achievements have been made in training cadres for various construction projects. University education in North China was established as early as the Anti-Japanese War. The first university in the North China Liberated Area—the North China United University, originally under the jurisdiction of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region—was founded in 1939, the third year of the Anti-Japanese War, and persisted in wartime university education in the enemy's rear. In 1941, the faculty and students numbered over 4,000. After Japan surrendered, it moved from the enemy's rear to Zhangjiakou, and young students from large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin flocked to study there. In 1946, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a nationwide civil war, and Zhangjiakou was invaded by the Chiang bandits, so it moved to central Hebei. Since its establishment in 1939, under the leadership of President Cheng Fangwu, the school has trained more than 19,000 cadres. After Japan's surrender, Northern University, originally in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, was established in Xingtai, Hebei, in November 1945, with Fan Wenlan as the president. More than 1,000 students graduated. In June 1948, the North China Liberated Area was established, and the two universities merged into North China University last August, with Wu Yuzhang as the president, Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu as the vice presidents, and Qian Junrui as the dean. There are currently more than 3,000 faculty and students. The university has four departments and two colleges. The First Department is of the nature of a political training class, and its task is to educate the enrolled young intellectuals with the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, understand the program and policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and initially establish a revolutionary outlook on life. The study period is currently tentatively set at three to six months. After graduation, most are assigned to participate in the construction of political, economic, cultural, and educational sectors in the liberated areas, and some are transferred to other departments of the school for further study or research. The Second Department is of the nature of a College of Education, specializing in training teachers for secondary schools and other educational cadres. It has six departments: Chinese Language and Literature, History and Geography, Education, Social Sciences, Foreign Languages, and Mathematics and Physics. The Third Department is of the nature of a College of Arts, with the aim of training literary and artistic cadres to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Fourth Department is the Research Department, which engages in the research of certain specialized issues and the training and improvement of university teachers. It currently has eight research offices, including Chinese History, Philosophy, Chinese Language, International Law, Foreign Languages, Politics, Education, and Literature and Art. The Agricultural College aims to train agricultural construction talents and currently has three departments: Economic Plants, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, and the Sugar Industry, and also has a research office. The task of the Engineering College is to train cadres for the industrial construction of the New Democratic state, divided into university and higher vocational sections. The university section currently has two departments: Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. The higher vocational section currently has classes in Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The students admitted are junior high school graduates, senior high school dropouts, junior factory cadres, and skilled workers. In addition, the library has a total of 60,000 books; the Academic Affairs Office has prepared more than 40,000 teaching materials and teaching reference books, which are distributed to various departments and colleges for use.
　　After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, our army liberated cities such as Zhangjiakou, Jining, and Jiaozuo. On the one hand, it took over and restored many secondary schools from the hands of the puppet regime, and on the other hand, it restored or established schools in the old liberated areas that had been destroyed by the Japanese invaders. Secondary education has greatly developed. At the time of the Japanese surrender, there were a total of 34 secondary schools in North China (26 in the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and 8 in the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region), with 6,359 students. By January 1946, the number of secondary schools in the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region had increased from the original 8 to 47, and the number of students had increased from 1,655 to 7,013. Before the withdrawal from Zhangjiakou (October 1946), the number of schools had increased to 56, with 10,350 students, an increase of seven times compared to the time of the Japanese surrender. The number of secondary schools in the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region also increased from the original 26 to 50. In terms of primary schools, before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, there were a total of 965 higher primary schools in North China, with 58,390 students, and 32,311 elementary primary schools, with 1,578,756 students. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the number increased rapidly, with 1,410 higher primary schools, with 130,285 students, and 60,849 elementary primary schools, with 3,267,288 students. After the Chiang bandits launched the anti-people civil war in July 1946, the Chiang bandit troops invaded some of our cities and villages, and primary and secondary schools were directly or indirectly destroyed. Just comparing the Jin-Lu-Yu area alone, the number of public secondary schools in the area had developed to 17 after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, but at this time, only 5 remained. At the same time, many secondary schools moved from cities to rural areas during this period. The destruction of primary school education by the Chiang bandits was even more serious. Wherever the Chiang bandit troops went, in addition to destroying primary schools, they arrested people, seized young men for conscription, and engaged in burning, killing, and looting, which greatly reduced the rural labor force of young and middle-aged people, forcing children to participate in family labor and indirectly depriving them of the opportunity to attend school. In areas particularly severely affected by the Chiang disaster, such as south of the Yellow River in Jin-Lu-Yu, primary school education is still difficult to restore. Since the autumn of 1947, when our army shifted from defense to offense, many cities in North China have been recovered one after another; land reform in the vast rural areas has been basically completed, and large numbers of farmers' children have flocked to schools to study, and primary and secondary school education has been restored and developed. Before the liberation of Pingjin, according to statistics from the basic areas of North China: there were 164 public secondary schools, including 52 middle schools, as well as normal schools and vocational schools. There were a total of 25,705 students. If we include the schools that have been restored or are being restored in the newly liberated small and medium-sized cities such as Baoding, Weihui, Jiaozuo, Xiaoji, Heze, and Changyuan, the number of secondary schools should be over 190, with over 30,000 students. According to incomplete statistics for primary schools in the entire region (the Jin-Lu-Yu statistics only include 24 counties north of the Yellow River, missing the Henan portion; the Jin-Zhong statistics are missing one special district): there are a total of 1,939 higher primary schools, 41,264 elementary primary schools, 154,126 higher primary school students, and 2,490,766 elementary primary school students.

　　三年来培养出万千干部华北教育建设获得成就
    现有大中小学学生近三百万人
    【本报讯】华北的教育事业，可分为大学教育、中小学教育及社会教育三部分。三年来，在培养各项建设干部上，获得显著成就。早在抗日战争时期，华北的大学教育即已创立。华北解放区的第一个大学——原属晋察冀边区的华北联合大学，成立于抗日战争第三年，即一九三九年，在当时的敌后环境中，坚持了战时的大学教育。一九四一年，教职学员曾达四千余人，日本投降后，从敌后进入张家口，平、津等大城市的青年学生纷纷前来学习。一九四六年国民党反动派发动全国大内战，张家口被蒋匪侵陷，即迁至冀中。该校自一九三九年成立以来，在校长成仿吾的领导下，共培养了一万九千多干部。在日本投降以后，原晋冀鲁豫边区的北方大学，又于一九四五年十一月成立于河北邢台，校长为范文澜，毕业的学生共一千余名。一九四八年六月，华北解放区成立，这两个大学遂于去年八月合并成为华北大学，校长为吴玉章，副校长为范文澜、成仿吾，教务长为钱俊瑞，教职学员现有三千余人。全校共设四个部、两个院。第一部系政治训练班性质，任务是教育入学的知识青年以马列主义及毛泽东思想的基本知识，了解中国共产党的纲领和政策，初步奠定革命的人生观。学习时间现暂定为三个月到六个月，毕业后，大部分分配参加解放区的政治、经济、文化教育等建设工作，一部分转入本校其他各部继续学习或研究。第二部为教育学院性质，专门培养中等学校之师资及其他教育干部。分设国文、史地、教育、社会科学、外语及数理化六系。第三部为文艺学院性质，以培养为工农兵服务的文艺干部为目的。第四部为研究部，从事研究一定的专门问题及培养与提高大学师资。现设有中国历史、哲学、中国语文、国际法、外国语、政治、教育及文艺等八个研究室。农学院以培养农业建设人才为目的，现设经济植物、畜牧兽医及糖业等三系，并设有研究室。工学院的任务为培养新民主主义国家的工业建设干部，分大学及高职二部，大学部现设电机、化工二系。高职部现设化工、机械及电机等班，所收学生为初中毕业、高中肄业学生，工厂初级干部及技术工人。此外，图书馆全部图书有六万余册；教务处另备教材及教学参考书共四万余册，分发至各部、院使用。
    华北的中小学教育，在日寇投降以后，我军解放了张家口、济宁、焦作等城市，一方面从口伪手中接收并恢复了不少中等学校，一方面恢复或创办老解放区被日寇摧残的学校，中等教育有很大发展。日寇投降时，全华北共有中等学校三十四处（原晋冀鲁豫边区二十六处，原晋察冀边区八处），学生六千三百五十九人。到一九四六年一月，原晋察冀边区的中学校即由原来的八处增至四十七处，学生由一千六百五十五人增至七千零十三人，在张家口退出（一九四六年十月）前，学校增至五十六处，学生一万零三百五十人，比日寇投降时增加了七倍。原晋冀鲁豫边区的中学校则由原来的二十六处发展到五十处。小学校方面，在日寇投降以前，全华北共有高小九百六十五处，学生五万八千三百九十人，初小三万二千三百十一处，学生一百五十七万八千七百五十六人。日寇投降以后，迅速增加，计：高小一千四百一十处，学生十三万零二百八十五人，初小六万零八百四十九处，学生三百二十六万七千二百八十八人。一九四六年七月蒋匪发动反人民的内战以后，蒋匪军侵陷了我们一些城市和乡村，中小学直接或间接受到了摧残。仅就冀鲁豫一个区作比较，该区在日寇投降后，公立中学已发展到十七处，到这时只剩了五处。同时不少中学在这期间由城市转移到了乡村。蒋匪对小学教育的摧残尤为严重，蒋匪军所到之处，除去摧毁小学校外，捕人抓丁，烧杀掠夺，使农村青壮年劳动力大量减少，迫使儿童不得不参加家庭劳动，间接剥夺了儿童的入学机会。受蒋灾特别惨重的地区，如冀鲁豫黄河以南，小学教育至今尚难以恢复。自一九四七年秋我军由防御转入进攻以后，华北许多城市相继收复；广大农村的土地改革基本上已告完成，农民子弟大批涌入学校学习，中小学教育又获得恢复与发展，在平津未解放前，根据华北基本地区的统计：公立的中等学校就有一百六十四处，其中有中学五十二处，此外有师范及职业学校等。学生共二万五千七百零五人。如果连新解放的保定、卫辉、焦作、小冀、菏泽、长垣等中小城市已经恢复或正在恢复的学校计算在内，中等学校当在一百九十处以上，学生当超过三万人。全区小学，根据不完全统计：（冀鲁豫仅有黄河以北二十四县的统计，缺河南部分；冀中缺一个专署的统计。）共有高小一千九百三十九处，初小四万一千二百六十四处，高小学生十五万四千一百二十六人，初小学生二百四十九万零七百六十六人。
