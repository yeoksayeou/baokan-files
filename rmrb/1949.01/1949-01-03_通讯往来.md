Correspondence

To all levels of prefectural committees, government agencies, schools, organizations, and comrade correspondents:

Regarding the decision of the North China Bureau for on-the-job cadres to study, have you made arrangements for study accordingly? What achievements and experiences have been gained during the learning process, and what are the specific circumstances? Are there any difficulties? Please report to us promptly.

To the Handan City Bureau of Industry and Commerce, various factories, trade unions, and worker comrades:

Regarding the outcome of the handling of the labor-management issue at the Daxing Iron Factory, if you feel there are still any inadequacies or have different opinions, please collect and send them to us for discussion in order to find a more reasonable solution to this problem. We also hope that you will report in detail the results of the revisions to unreasonable systems at iron factories such as Yuxing and the handling of profit sharing at Qingli Iron Factory.

To the responsible comrades of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions:

After you have seen the outcome of the handling of the labor-management issue at the Handan City Daxing Iron Factory, please offer your opinions for research.
