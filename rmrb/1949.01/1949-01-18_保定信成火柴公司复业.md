【Jizhong Electric】Baoding Xincheng Match Company has officially resumed operations after active rectification. The company was established in the spring of the year before last, with a total of 20 staff and workers. However, due to the Kuomintang bandits' heavy taxes and levies and the exclusion by bureaucrat capital, it was forced to close down by the end of the year before last. During the Kuomintang bandits' rule, the company had to provide at least three laborers every day, with each laborer requiring three jin of white flour, totaling 300 jin per month. In addition, hiring soldiers once a month also required contributing five bags of white flour. Since liberation, the company's manager, Geng Xitang, seeing that the People's Government earnestly protects national industry and commerce, immediately gathered the workers, cleaned up the houses, and repaired the machinery. Everything is now in order and ready for reopening. They are currently planning to purchase a large quantity of matchsticks from Shenze Limin Match Company to solve the raw material shortage.

　　保定信成火柴公司复业
    【冀中电】保定市信成火柴公司经积极整顿后，现已正式复业。该公司系前年春天建立，当时职员、工人共二十人。但由于蒋匪的苛杂勒索和官僚资本的排斥，经营到前年年底即被迫倒闭。蒋匪统治时，该公司每日至少要出三个夫，每个夫每日需三斤白面费用，每月即需三百斤。此外，一个月要雇一次兵，也须摊白面五袋。自解放后，该公司经理耿翕堂看到人民政府切实保护民族工商业，马上召集工人，收拾房舍，修理机器，现已整理就绪，重新开张。现正计划到深泽利民火柴公司购买大批火柴杆，解决原料困难。
