　　Learning Developments
　　△The directly subordinate organs of the Jinzhong District Party Committee, under its leadership, have determined that formal theoretical and cultural studies will begin this month. Approximately 350 cadres currently in office will participate. In addition to re-studying the decisions of the North China Bureau from the 4th to the 7th, they will continue to study the history of social development, requiring this course to be completed within January. The Jinzhong District Party Committee attaches great importance to this study, and has decided that the quality of learning will be one of the important criteria for evaluating and promoting cadres in the future. As for cultural learning, each organ is now formulating a plan, preparing to establish spare-time schools or cultural learning classes to formalize cultural learning.
　　△Also: The First Prefectural Committee of the district, in order to clear away past obstacles to learning, such as guerrilla habits, empiricism, and a state of anarchy and indiscipline, has specifically arranged the following for future learning: (1) In terms of organizational leadership, study committees will be established at all levels, with the secretaries and deputy secretaries in charge. A dedicated person will be assigned to manage daily work. (2) Regarding learning content, cadres at the prefectural committee level will study basic issues of the Chinese revolution and current events and policies. Cadres at the county and district levels will focus on studying various policies. (3) For supplementary cultural education, it is stipulated that county-level organs can establish cadre spare-time cultural classes in nearby normal schools or senior primary schools. As for learning methods, individual reading will be the main method for prefectural committee-level cadres, supplemented by group discussions. County and district-level cadres can strengthen group discussions on the basis of individual reading.
　　△On the 23rd of last month, the Propaganda Department of the Yicheng County Party Committee inspected learning and found that the service staff of various directly subordinate organs had made considerable progress in cultural learning. However, it was also found that many cadres regarded learning as a burden. In addition, the responsible comrades of various organs lacked leadership, which further led to a state of laissez-faire. The county committee has proposed ways to overcome this, to clarify the purpose and significance of learning from an ideological perspective, and to formulate learning plans according to specific circumstances. Reporting and testing systems have been established. After this inspection, everyone realized the importance of learning and said, "We must do a good job in the future."
　　△The Beiyue Fourth Special District Administrative Cadre School concluded the New Year's reminiscence movement on the morning of January 3rd. In the afternoon, it decided on a one-week plan to study the New Year's Message, and immediately began intensive study of the New Year's Message. From January 3rd to 5th, in addition to individual reading, raising questions, and taking notes, it also organized two small group discussions. After repeated deliberation, a formal general meeting was held on January 5th for a full day of discussion. Through this study, erroneous ideas such as blindness in learning and studying for two bowls of millet porridge have been overcome. Moreover, in terms of political understanding, the peaceful conspiracy of the Kuomintang has been initially recognized, and support for "carrying the revolution through to the end" has been voiced. (Liu Geng)
　　△Comrade Jiang Kunyuan, Secretary of the Seventh District Party Committee of She County, convened a meeting of district cadres and cooperative cadres on December 30th to review the previous period of learning and identify the reasons for past poor learning: (1) The organizational leadership of past learning was unsound, (2) There was a lack of inspection, criticism, and praise, (3) Individuals were not focused on learning and did not recognize the importance of learning. After everyone's self-criticism, a specific plan for future learning was formulated: (1) Organizational leadership: a study committee will be established in the district, consisting of the secretary and deputy secretaries of the district party committee, the chairmen of various salvation associations, and the district heads, for a total of seven people. The district will be divided into study groups according to base points, with the base point leaders serving as the study group leaders. The study committee will hold a meeting every half month to study and grasp the thinking of cadres. The base point leaders will hold a meeting every three days to discuss work and exchange learning experiences. Each group will be responsible for conducting a test once a week, and will regularly summarize, inspect, commend, and criticize. In addition, the study committee will also conduct irregular spot checks of study notes. As for the learning methods of cadres working in rural areas, it was decided to combine village cadres and primary school teachers into one unit for learning, learning what is done, and writing more summaries and reports. Those with low levels of literacy will learn to recognize and write characters. (2) Learning content: Group B plans to begin from January 1949, and learn a brief history of social development and "On New Democracy" in the first half of the year. Everyone must take notes. Group C will begin from January 1949 and learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentages in arithmetic in the first half of the year; learn to write reports in Chinese language, and strive to be able to write general notes; understand the abbreviations of each province in geography, and understand the overview of the Taihang region; understand several major revolutionary programs in history. Combine learning with policies and current events.

　　△In order to improve the ideology and work enthusiasm of cadres, Shahe held a current affairs forum on December 31st of last year. After Comrade Han Yaoxi, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, talked about the comparison of strength between the enemy and us, the Autumn Offensive, and the current victory, every cadre was very excited, and their work attitude became more stable and active.
　　For example, Li Zhongsheng, secretary of the Sixth District, said: "Work is the same everywhere. Of course, it is good to go to big cities, but we revolutionary work, can't have the thought of enjoying the scenery! I absolutely obey the party's transfer."
　　Hu Xianxiao said: "After today's current affairs forum, I felt that I can't keep up with the development of the situation. I was illiterate before, but after the party's training, I am now also a cadre. Looking back, I only cared about myself turning over, and didn't care about the turning over of the oppressed people of the whole country, which is wrong."
　　Su Qingyun, Secretary of the Fifth District Party Committee, said: "The party is like my parents. Wherever my parents tell me to go, I will definitely obey. Before being transferred, I will also train the cadres of the district well, so that the work of the Fifth District will not be affected." The people who spoke at the meeting were very enthusiastic and expressed their attitude: resolutely obey the organization's transfer. Before the transfer, absolutely settle down to work, and absolutely cannot hinder work because of the transfer.

　　学习动态
    △晋中区党委所领导之直属机关比较正规的理论学习与文化学习，已确定由本月起开始，参加学习的在职干部约有三百五十余人。除已于四日至七日将华北局的决定重新学习外，并将继续学习社会发展史，要求此门功课在一月份以内学完。晋中区党委对这次学习极为重视，决定今后将以学习成绩好坏作为鉴定与提拔干部的重要标准之一。至于文化学习，现在由各机关拟定计划，预备成立业余学校或文化学习班，使文化学习走向正规。
    △又：该区一地委为扫清以往的学习障碍，如游击习气、经验主义、无政府无纪律状态等，特具体布置了今后的学习：（一）在组织领导上，各级建立学委会，由书记与副书记负责。并设专人管理日常工作。（二）学习内容，地委级干部学习中国革命基本问题、时事政策。县区级干部则着重学习各种政策。（三）业余文化补习，规定县级机关可在附近的师范或中学高小内，建立干部业余文化补习班。至于学习方法，地委级以个人阅读为主，集体讨论为辅，县区级干部可在个人阅读基础上，加强集体讨论。
    △翼城县委宣传部于上月二十三日检查学习，发现各直属机关的勤杂人员在文化学习上已获得不少成绩。但也同样发现不少干部把学习看成是负担。加上各机关负责同志缺乏领导，更形成了自流现象。该县县委会已提出克服的办法，让大家从思想上明确学习的目的和意义，并按具体情况订出学习计划。订出了汇报、测验制度。经过这次检查，使大家认识了学习的重要，都说：“今后非搞好不行。”
    △北岳四专区行政干部学校，在一月三日上午结束了新年回忆运动，下午又决定了学习新年献词一星期的计划，随即开始了对新年献词的紧张学习，从一月三日到五日，每人除自由阅读提出问题、作笔记、并组织了两次的小组漫谈讨论外，经过反复酝酿后，在一月五日又正式开大会讨论了一天。经过这次学习，已克服了学习中的盲目状态及为两碗小米饭而学习等错误思想。而且，在政治认识方面：初步认清了国民党的和平阴谋，拥护“将革命进行到底”。　　（刘耿）
    △涉县七区分委书记江坤元同志于十二月三十日召开区干部与联社干部会议，检查前段学习，找出了过去学习不好的原因：（一）过去学习组织领导不健全，（二）缺乏检查与批评表扬。（三）个人学习不专心，没有认识学习的重要。经过大家检讨后，又具体定出今后学习计划：（一）组织领导，区成立学委会，由分委正副书记及各救会主席，正副区长等七人组成，区按基点编为学习小组，基点组长任学习组长，学委会半月一次会议，研究学习与掌握干部思想。各基点组长三天一次会议，连谈工作并交流学习经验。每星期各组由组长负责进行一次测验，并定期总结检查表扬批评。另外，学委会还要举行不定期的抽查学习笔记。至于在乡村工作干部的学习方法，决定结合本村干部与小学教员为一单位学习，做啥学啥，多写总结汇报。文化程度低的，要学习认字写字。（二）学习内容，乙组计划从四九年元月开始，前半年学会社会发展简史与新民主主义论，每人都要记笔记。丙组从一九四九年元月开始，前半年算术学会加减乘除及百分法；国语学会写汇报，争取会写一般的笔记；地理念会各省简称，了解太行区的概况；历史了解几个大革命节目。结合学习政策时事。
    　　　（七区分委会）
    △为了提高干部思想与工作热情，沙河特于去年十二月三十一日举行了时事座谈会。大会经过县委副书记韩耀西同志谈了敌我力量对比，秋季攻势和目前胜利后，使每个干部非常兴奋，工作态度都更加安心、积极了。
    如六区分书李忠生同志说：“工作在哪里也是一样，到大城市当然好，但咱们革命工作，不能存着亨受看景思想呀！我是绝对服从党的调动”。
    胡先孝说：“经过今天大会的时事座谈在我思想上感觉到是赶不上形势的发展，我早先不识字，经过党的培养，我现在也当了干部。回想起来，我只顾我自己翻了身，不顾全国的受压迫人民的翻身，这是不对的。
    五区分委书记苏清云说：“党就象我的爹娘一样，爹娘叫我去哪里，我一定服从，未调前，我还要将区的干部都要培养好，使五区工作不受损失。”大会上发言的人非常踊跃，都表示态度：坚决服从组织调动未调动前，绝对安心工作，绝对不能因调动妨碍工作。
