　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Reports from various sources: The Ruhr Conference, secretly convened in London by the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg since November 11, 1948, concluded in late December. The conference issued an 18-point joint communique on December 28, once again undermining the Potsdam Agreement. The main content of the joint communique is the illegal establishment of the "International Authority for the Ruhr" and the "Military Security Board," and the stipulation of an annual steel production quota of 10.7 million tons for the British and American occupation zones. The main functions of the Ruhr Authority are: to manage the distribution of Ruhr coal, coking coal, and steel production. The work of the Ruhr Authority will also be closely linked with the American so-called European Economic Recovery Cooperation Agency. In the Ruhr Authority, the United States, Britain, and France will each have three votes, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg will each have one vote, and Germany will have three votes, with the voting rights exercised by the occupying authorities. Most decisions require eight votes to pass. As a result, the United States and Britain can completely manipulate the decisions of the Authority, while Germany's close neighbors, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, cannot have a decisive influence on the fate of the Ruhr.
    According to a commentary by the famous observer Simon broadcast by the Teletype Agency: In order to alleviate the concerns of the majority of the French people, the Ruhr Agreement takes both open and secret forms. In addition to the fact that, under the pressure of the United States, Britain and France agreed that the signatory countries should not insist on the nationalization of Ruhr industry, the three governments also agreed to re-arm Western Germany at an "appropriate time." In addition, there is a reservation that within two months, Western representatives will sign a formal agreement to form an army in West Germany.

　　六国鲁尔会议公布非法决定
    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报导：美、英、法、荷、比、卢六国自一九四八年十一月十一日起在伦敦私下召开的鲁尔会议，已于十二月下旬闭幕。该会议并于十二月二十八日发表再次破坏波茨顿决定的十八点的联合公报。联合公报的主要内容为非法建立“鲁尔国际管制局”、“军事安全局”，及规定英美占领区之钢产年额一千零七十万吨。鲁尔局的主要职权为：掌管鲁尔煤、焦煤及钢产的分配。鲁尔局的工作并将与美国的所谓欧洲经济复兴合作机构取得密切连系。在鲁尔局中，美英法将各有三票，比、荷、卢各有一票，德国三票，其投票权则由占领当局行使。大多数之决定须有八票同意。结果，美英两国可以完全操纵该局的决定，而德国的紧邻法、比、荷、卢反不能对鲁尔之命运有决定的影响。
    据电通社广播著名观察家西蒙的评论称：为了缓和法国大多数人民的忧虑，鲁尔协定采取了公开与秘密的两种形式。秘密协定除在美国的压力下，英法两国同意签字国不得坚持鲁尔工业国有化外，三国政府并同意在“适当时机”重行武装西部德国，此外，并有一项保留，即在两个月之内，西方代表将签订在西德组成军队的正式协定。
