　　[Jizhong Electric] After the Cangzhou City Publicly Operated Jiji Hydroelectric Company earnestly began to improve its operations and management, work efficiency has been improved, achieving sufficient electricity, low costs, expanded business, and the accumulation of production capital from losses. After Cangzhou City's liberation, the company immediately began to recover, but due to improper management, imprecise division of labor, and chaotic systems, resources were severely wasted. From July of the year before last to January of last year, it lost 6,873,555 Jizhong currency, even losing over 190 tons of coal that the municipal government had supported it with. The consumption of miscellaneous items and machines was not even calculated. After rectifying the engineering system and strictly inspecting engineering work, the company's management and production have greatly improved and increased. From May to November of last year, it made a net profit of over 72.2 million yuan. This is because the company first clearly divided the work of its employees. For example, business, engineering, accounting, personnel, procurement, water plants, and power plants are each responsible for their own tasks. A relatively formal management system has been initially established. The task that used to require eighteen people, now only requires thirteen. Second, a strict inspection system was implemented. For example, in checking for electricity theft, 58 households were found in the twelve days after November. Third, business regulations were formulated and distributed to each household. Private wiring is not allowed, and electricity materials are purchased in a planned way to avoid grabbing materials randomly and spending more money without getting good products. Fourth, a trade union was established in the factory (this is an important link), strengthening the leadership and education of employees, and gradually improving their political consciousness so that they can consider the interests of the people. Ideological education was carried out in group meetings for individual people who were corrupt or causing trouble. Wages were adjusted based on labor conditions, responsibilities, and abilities, after group discussions and public agreement by employees, which significantly improved the morale of the employees. Coal consumption has been halved compared to the past. Every night, when there are fewer lights used, workers take the opportunity to pick out the unburned coal and burn it again. They also researched using "silk" or "copper sieve" to replace hair ropes (asbestos, which is very expensive), and repaired old large conveyor belts for use on small machines. This greatly reduced expenses. The workers said, "The factory is our home, and tidying up the factory is like settling down at home." Zhang Jingqin, the foreman, voluntarily handed over more than 30 catties of white grease (used to lubricate machines) left over from the Japanese occupation to the factory. Worker Li Defa handed over palm ropes and sheet metal left over from the Japanese occupation to the factory. In April of the year before last, worker Zhang Jingxing reported a 15-horsepower electric motor that had been hidden during the Kuomintang rule of Cangzhou. In August, when materials were extremely scarce, outside workers collected many electrical materials and porcelain bottles that had been buried in Dongquan and Nanguan during the puppet Public Security Bureau era. The company rewarded these workers separately. Thanks to the efforts of the employees, machines rarely malfunctioned, and the lights were particularly bright, so the number of users increased. From February to November, 1,215 lights were added. The power plant is currently studying the use of electricity to drive Cangzhou's industrial machinery. In addition to driving its own water plant (supplying water to about 30,000 citizens), it also drives two 15-horsepower electric oil presses at Fukang and Dongsheng, which is much cheaper than using diesel engines. They are now continuing to study further wage adjustments, establish formal systems, establish precise accounting systems, and further expand their business.

　　沧市水电公司改善管理后
  　达到电量足成本低
    过去把资本赔了现在已有了积累
    【冀中电】沧州市公营既济水电公司，切实着手改善经营和管理工作后，工作效率已提高，达到了电量足、成本低、营业扩大、生产资本由亏损到积累。该公司于沧市解放后，即着手恢复，但由于经营不得法，分工不精密，制度杂乱，以致严重的浪费了资材。从前年七月到去年一月止赔了冀钞（下同）六百八十七万三千五百五十五元，把市政府扶植的一百九十余吨煤也赔了进去。零星物品和机器消耗还未计算在内。经过整顿工务制度，严格工务检查后，公司管理和生产大为改进和提高。从去年五月到十一月，得纯利七千二百二十余万元。因为公司首先对职工进行了明确分工。如营业、工务、会计、人事、采购、水厂、电厂等各负专责。初步建立起比较正规的管理制度。过去十八个人的任务，现在十三个人就行了。第二，实行严格检查制度。如在检查偷电上，从十一月份后十二天，就查出了五十八户。第三，制定营业章程，发到各户。不许私设电线，并有计划的收买电料，以免临时乱抓，多花钱没好货。第四，厂内建立了职工会（这是个重要的环节），加强了对职工人员的领导、教育，逐步提高其政治觉悟，使能为人民利益着想。对个别贪污捣鬼的人，在小组会上开展了思想教育。在工资上根据劳动条件与职责、能力，经职工人员分组讨论，自报公议，进行调整，这使职工的情绪都显著的提高。用煤比过去节省一半，每到深夜，用灯少的时候，工人乘空时把没烧透的煤拣出再烧一遍。还研究出用“蚕丝”或“铜罗”代替毛绳（石绵质，很贵），将用旧了的大输带，修理后放在小机器上使用。这样使开支大大减低。工人们说：“工厂是咱们的家，把工厂收拾好，就等于安好了家。”领班张景钦，把在日寇时期留下的卅多斤白油膏（擦机器用的）自动献出交给厂方。工人李德发把日寇统治时留下的棕绳、白铁都交给厂里。前年四月工人张景星报告了国民党统治沧市时收藏的一个十五马力的电动机。在材料极端缺乏的八月里，外线工人搜集出伪公安局时代在东圈、南关埋藏的许多电料和瓷瓶。公司对这些工人都分别予以奖励。由于职工的努力，使机器很少发生故障，灯光格外充足，因此，用户越来越多。从二月到十一月就增加了一千二百一十五盏灯。电力厂，刻正研究用电力带动沧市的工业机器。目前除带动该公司自己经营的自来水厂（供给约三万多市民用水）外，还带动着福康、东生两家两个十五马力的电力榨油机，用电动机比用柴油机便宜的多。现在他们正继续研究进一步调整工资，建立正规制度，树立精确核算制度，进一步开展业务。
