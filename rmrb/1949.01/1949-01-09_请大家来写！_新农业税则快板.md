To implement the new agricultural tax regulations promulgated by the North China People's Government and to conduct in-depth publicity and explanation in the vast rural areas, this newspaper is soliciting new agricultural tax rhymes. The content must be based on the original text of the tax regulations published in this newspaper on January 4 and the newspaper's editorial, grasping the main points and explaining them; the language should be simple and easy to understand without losing the original meaning. We hope that comrades who are good at this work will actively contribute, and once adopted, the remuneration will be generous.
