　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 29th: While large numbers of Kuomintang warlords and bureaucrats are fleeing to Taiwan, attempting to turn it into a base for their final struggles, American imperialists are also intensifying their aggressive activities in Taiwan. An Associated Press dispatch from January 24th, citing Hong Kong newspapers, revealed: "MacArthur has dispatched representatives to Taiwan to carry out activities, preparing to swallow this piece of Chinese territory." The Hong Kong "Far East Reporting Magazine" pointed out: Any attempt by Chiang Kai-shek or American interventionists to use Taiwan as a war base will inevitably be met with the most fierce opposition from all Chinese people, especially those whose homes are in Taiwan.
