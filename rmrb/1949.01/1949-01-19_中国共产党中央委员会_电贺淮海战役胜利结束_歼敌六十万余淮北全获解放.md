Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th – The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has sent a telegram congratulating the victorious conclusion of the Huaihai Campaign. The telegram reads:

Comrades Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, Deng Xiaoping, Rao Shushi, Zhang Yunyi, Su Yu, Tan Zhenlin, Chen Geng, and all comrades of the East China People's Liberation Army and the Central Plains People's Liberation Army:

The Huaihai Campaign, which began on November 6th of last year, has completely and victoriously concluded on January 10th of this year. In these 65 days of combat, you annihilated the entirety of Huang Botao's army group, the main force of the Kuomintang reactionary government on the southern front, comprising five armies and ten divisions; the entirety of Huang Wei's army group, comprising four armies and eleven divisions (including one division that revolted); the entirety of the Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang army groups led by Du Yuming, comprising ten armies and twenty-five divisions (including one cavalry brigade); Feng Zhi'an's force of two armies and four divisions (including three and a half divisions that revolted); one division of Liu Ruming's force, one army and two divisions of Sun Liangcheng's force, and one garrison division each in Su County and Lingbi. In total, you eliminated approximately 600,000 enemy troops, including 22 regular armies and 55 divisions. With this, the main forces and elite divisions of the enemy on the southern front have been wiped out. You captured war criminal Du Yuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Xuzhou "剿匪" (Bandit Suppression) Headquarters, Huang Wei, Commander of the Kuomintang 12th Army Group, and many other high-ranking Kuomintang military officers; you killed Huang Botao, Commander of the Kuomintang 7th Army Group. You repelled the reinforcements of the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming army groups, forcing them to flee towards the Yangtze River line, thereby completely liberating the area north of the Huai River and bringing most of the Huainan area under our control. All these great achievements are the result of the united efforts and arduous struggles of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Liberation Army and the people, and the party, government, army, and people at the front and rear. We extend to you our warm congratulations and regards.
