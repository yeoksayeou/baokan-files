Taihang Electric Dispatch: The Taihang Third Administrative Office recently convened a meeting of hospital directors from various counties to summarize medical work and establish future hospital work guidelines. According to incomplete statistics from Changzhi, Licheng, Lucheng, and Pingshun county hospitals over the past six months, they treated over 60,000 patients, with only 60 deaths. To consolidate this achievement and further develop medical work, the following guidelines were established for county hospitals: With county and public hospitals as the mainstay, unite all Chinese and Western doctors and pharmacies, wholeheartedly treat the people, and develop social health undertakings. To implement these guidelines, it is necessary to overcome and resolve the contradictions between Chinese and Western medicine, so that they can unite, learn from each other, and improve. In addition, it is necessary to establish the idea of benefiting both the public and the private sectors and considering the long-term interests of the people, overcoming the practices of purely seeking profits or incurring losses for the immediate interests of the masses. In terms of work style, it is necessary to establish an enthusiastic attitude of serving the people's health cause. In urban hospitals, consultation procedures should be simplified, and doctors should arrive promptly upon request and provide immediate diagnosis; examinations should be thorough and careful, opposing carelessness. The past tendency of focusing solely on treatment and neglecting mass health work should be overcome. Not only should diseases be treated, but attention should also be paid to carrying out mass health work to reduce the suffering of the masses. In terms of medication and treatment, not only should modern Western medicine be used, but Chinese medicine and even effective folk remedies should also be appropriately utilized. Efforts should be intensified to cultivate and train medical personnel and improve the skills of medical staff.

　　团结一切中西医生
  　开展社会卫生事业
  　太行三专区规定医院工作方针
    【太行电】太行三专署于日前召开各县县立医院院长会议，总结医务工作，规定今后医院工作方针。据长治、黎城、潞城、平顺四个县医院半年来不完全统计，共看了六万除病人，其中死亡仅六十人。为了巩固这一成果，进一步开展医务工作，他们规定的今后各县医院工作方针是：以县立和公立医院为主，团结一切中西医生和中西药铺，全心全意为人民治病，开展社会卫生事业。为贯彻这一方针，必须克服与解决中西医互相间的矛盾，使中西医团结一致，互相学习，提高。另外要树立公私两利为人民长远利益打算的思想。克服单纯营利和单纯为群众眼前利益而赔本的作法。在作风上，要树立为人民卫生事业热心服务的态度。在城市里的医院，看病手续要简单，应随请随到，随来随诊；看病时要细致、慎重，反对粗心大意。应克服过去单纯治疗，忽视群众卫生工作的偏向。不仅治病，而且要注意开展群众卫生工作，以减少群众病苦。在用药与治疗上，不仅注意用近代的西药，而且应适当的利用中药，以至能治病的偏方。要加紧培养与训练医务人材，提高医务人员的技术。
