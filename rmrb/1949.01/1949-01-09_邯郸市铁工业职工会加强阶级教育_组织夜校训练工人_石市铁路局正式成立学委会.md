The Handan Iron Industry Trade Union Strengthens Class Education
　　Organizes Night School to Train Workers
　　Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau Formally Establishes Study Committee

[Handan News] Since the Handan Iron Industry Workers' Night School opened on November 30th, the second term is nearing its end. The first term had a total of 34 students, and this term has increased to 45. The workers are all very enthusiastic about learning. Those who haven't participated are only afraid that it won't be their turn this winter. For example, after Comrade Wang De of the trade union finished the first term, every time he went to an iron factory, a group of workers would ask him, "When will the next term start? Am I in it?" Everyone has endless things to say when they mention night school.

This term, everyone is even more eager to learn. On the first day of school, every worker arrived as soon as the siren of the electricity company sounded. Even with the snowy weather the last two days, night school did not stop. Everyone rushes to speak at every discussion. Geng Changhai of Gongli is the most active speaker. Wang Yaocai, a worker at the Zhenfeng factory, may be old, but he knows a lot of principles. Once, during a discussion on the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, he said, "In the past, workers didn't talk about working, only about pocket money, going to the theater, and taking baths. This made a 'left' mistake (inclination). This year, with the development of industry and commerce, some shopkeepers only remember to tell workers to work, and when they are unhappy, they still act badly, thinking that the government's protection of industry and commerce is supporting them. This made a 'right' mistake (inclination). The two legs must be equal. If either one is longer, you can't walk. Mutual benefit for labor and capital means that both workers and shopkeepers benefit, and that's the right thing to do." Lin Si, a worker at the Taimao public factory, said, "The managers of public factories turn over all the money they earn to the state and don't take it home, so there is no exploitation in the factory. At the same time, there are working hours, unlike private factories where there are no working hours, and the money they earn goes into their own pockets." Guo Qinghuai said, "Whether in a public or private factory, we must work hard, because we also have to eat and wear. If we don't work hard, we won't even be able to take care of ourselves."

In more than ten days of study, everyone not only understood the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, but also understood the reasons for winning battles, and realized that they are the masters of the liberated areas. The second term concluded with a test on December 29th, and awards were prepared to be given out on the 30th.

Each unit can determine it according to the actual work situation, without affecting the eight-hour work day. Everyone must take notes during the study. Each study branch reports to the Study Committee in writing once a week. Meetings are held once a week. The funds used for leading the study are paid from the education funds, but larger expenses can be paid separately after being approved by the bureau affairs meeting. In a notice issued to each unit on the 31st, the Study Committee especially emphasized that they must be determined to lead the study, create a upsurge, and strictly adhere to the system. The quality of learning is included as part of the performance evaluation.

　　邯郸市铁工业职工会加强阶级教育
  　组织夜校训练工人
    石市铁路局正式成立学委会
    【邯郸讯】邯郸铁工业工人夜学自十一月三十日开办以来，现在第二期已快结束，上期共到学员三十四人，这期增到四十五人，工友们学习情绪都挺高，没有参加的只怕今年冬天轮不到自己，如职工会王德同志在一期结束后，每到一个铁工厂里，总有一伙工人乱问：“下期啥时开，有我没有？”大家一提起夜校，都是话说不完。
    这一期夜校，大家学习劲头更好，开学头一天，各个工人在电灯公司汽笛一拉过，就都到齐了，就是前两天下雪天气，夜学也没有停过，每次讨论会都抢着发言，工利的耿长海发言最积极，振丰工厂工人王耀彩，别看年纪大，懂的道理确不少，有一次讨论劳资两利政策时，他说：“前年工人不说干活，光要零花钱，看戏、洗澡，这犯了左腿（倾）错误；今年发展工商业，有的掌柜，光记得叫工人干活，不高兴了，还耍态度，心想政府保护工商业是给他撑腰，这犯了右腿（倾）的错误，两条腿得一般齐，哪条长了，也不能走路，劳资两利是叫工人、掌柜都有利，这样才算作对。”太茂公营工厂工人林四则说：“公营工厂的经理，挣下钱都交给国家，又不拿回家去，所以工厂里面就没有剥削，同时干活有钟点，不象私家工厂干活没个钟点，挣下钱装在他自己腰包。”郭清怀说：“不管在公家私家工厂，咱们都得好好干活，因为自己也要吃穿，不好好干活，那连自己也会顾不住。”
    在十几天的学习中，大家不但懂得了劳资两利的政策，同时也懂得了打胜仗的道理，明白了自己是解放区的主人翁，现在第二期已于十二月二十九日进行测验，准备三十日发奖即告结束。

    【石家庄讯】石家庄区铁路管理局已于上月二十九日成立学习委员会。第一副局长王效斌同志任学委会主任，人事处代理处长许海＠同志和铁路总工会大林同志分任副主任，殷之瑶同志为秘书。许海＠同志兼作编班划组等工作，秘书主任郎森南同志负责通讯报导工作，大林同志负责考试、测验。首次会议决定：各处和分工会均统一建立学习分会。参加学习的人以科员和工会委员以上干部为主，分甲、乙两组，以社会发展史为基本学习材料，同时学习时事、政策；文化程度低的干部单编文化学习组。第一个月的计划则主要是学习“目前形势与我们的任务”。每天规定两小时学习时间，但不要求全局都在一个时间，各单位可根据实际工作情况而定，不影响八小时的工作，每个人都必须参加。学习中每人都要写笔记。学习分会每周向学委会书面汇报一次。会议均为每周一次。领导学习所用经费由教育费中开支，但较大费用还可经局务会议批准后单独开支。学委会在三十一日发给各单位的通知中，特别强调一定要下决心把学习领导起来，造成热潮，并严格制度坚持下去。学习成绩的好坏列入考绩内容的一部分。
