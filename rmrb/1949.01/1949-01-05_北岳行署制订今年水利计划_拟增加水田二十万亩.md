　　North Yue Administrative Office Formulates This Year's Water Conservancy Plan
  　Intends to Increase Paddy Fields by 200,000 Mu
    [North Yue News] North Yue achieved great success in water conservancy construction last year (as previously reported in this newspaper), but development remains extremely uneven: The fourth district's irrigated land accounts for 33.4 percent of the total cultivated land area. The water volume of the Hutuo River, Ye River, Sha River, Tang River, and other rivers within its jurisdiction already feels insufficient during droughts, indicating that the expansion of water conservancy is approaching saturation. The irrigated land in other districts only accounts for 4.5 to 13.5 percent of the total cultivated land. Chahar South and Yanbei have the Sanggan River, Hun River, and other rivers of various sizes that can be utilized, but they have not yet been developed. Furthermore, due to exploitation and destruction by the enemy and puppets, many canals have been abandoned and are ineffective. In the fourth and fifth districts, the irrigated land in Zhengding accounts for 89.6 percent of its total cultivated land area, and the irrigated land in Xingtang accounts for 35.4 percent of its total cultivated land area, while other counties are far behind. According to incomplete surveys in twelve counties, there are approximately one million mu or more of dry land that can be irrigated by wells and transformed into paddy fields. In areas with waterwheels and wells, there is a situation of having many wells but few waterwheels, and some wells and waterwheels are broken. Based on the above situation, the North Yue Administrative Office has formulated this year's water conservancy construction plan, determining that this year's large-scale production should prioritize the vigorous and widespread construction of water conservancy as one of its main tasks. Regionally, the focus should be on Chahar South and Yanbei, and within Chahar South and Yanbei, the emphasis should be on restoring existing water conservancy facilities, extensively opening and repairing flood canals that require less effort and yield greater benefits, and silting and improving the soil. In the plain areas of the fourth and fifth districts, the focus should be on drilling wells, installing and repairing waterwheels, consolidating existing water conservancy facilities, and strengthening the management of large canals and channels. It is calling on all localities to learn from the fourth district in opening canals for irrigation and to learn from Zhengding in terms of waterwheels and wells. Building dikes and dams, dredging water, and preventing floods are regular tasks in water conservancy construction in all areas. Based on the work foundation, mass strength, cadre conditions, and flood silting conditions, the specific requirements for various water conservancy constructions are as follows: 1. Six large canals are planned to expand irrigated land by 45,000 mu, including 20,000 mu for the Guangji Canal, 2,500 mu for the Limin Canal, 2,500 mu for the Agriculture Canal, 2,000 mu for the Dongsheng Canal, and 10,000 mu for the Rongzhen Canal (increasing spring and autumn water use), with three canals accounting for 8,000 mu. 2. Opening and renovating new canals is planned to expand water conservancy by 60,000 mu, including 21,000 mu in the first special district, 12,000 mu in the third special district, 7,000 mu in the fourth special district, 3,000 mu in the fifth special district, and 17,000 mu in the sixth special district. 3. Restoring old canals is planned to expand water conservancy by 40,000 mu, including 25,500 mu in the first special district, 3,500 mu in the third special district, 3,000 mu in the fourth special district, and 8,000 mu in the sixth special district. 4. Drilling 1,000 wells is planned to expand water conservancy by 25,000 mu, including 300 wells in the fourth special district, expanding water conservancy by 7,500 mu, and 700 wells in the fifth special district, expanding water conservancy by 17,500 mu. Adding 3,150 waterwheels, with 1,000 waterwheels installed in new wells and 2,150 waterwheels added to old wells, each waterwheel expanding irrigated land by 10 mu, totaling 21,500 mu of expanded irrigated land. Including 1,000 waterwheels in the fourth special district and 2,150 waterwheels in the fifth special district. 5. Old and broken waterwheels should be restored as much as possible, and repairing waterwheels should become a regular task. Summing up the above five items, the entire region is required to expand water conservancy by 200,000 mu next year. 6. All localities are required to universally and deeply educate the masses, overcome the mentality of luck and the idea of ​​resigning to fate, build dikes and dams, carry out long-term flood prevention construction, and establish the concept that man can conquer nature. In order to fully realize the above plan, the leading organs at all levels must: (1) Include water conservancy construction as a major item on the agenda of production leadership, convene water conservancy symposiums, send special personnel to investigate and survey, specifically grasp the situation, and further continue the winter water conservancy preparation work (planning projects, improving organizations, solving problems, preparing materials, etc.), laying the foundation for this year's construction and development. (2) Strengthen the planning of water conservancy construction, overcome technical difficulties, and based on the needs of various localities, vigorously recruit local experts, boldly use local experts, survey and estimate various smaller projects, make specific plans, strengthen organizational work, assign specific tasks, and designate special personnel to be responsible. Technical cadres and administrative cadres must be closely combined and unified. (3) For particularly large projects, the administrative office is responsible for surveying and estimating, or requesting the North China government to assist in carrying them out. (4) If the project is large and the strength of the masses is insufficient, you can request loan subsidies. (North Yue Administrative Office Agriculture and Forestry Department)

　　北岳行署制订今年水利计划
  　拟增加水田二十万亩
    【北岳讯】北岳去年水利建设获得很大成绩（本报前已刊载），但发展仍极不平衡：四分区水地占全部耕地面积百分之三十三点四，辖境内之滹沱河、冶河、沙河、唐河等河水量，旱时已感水力不足，表明水利之扩大已接近饱和程度；其他各分区水地则只占全部耕地百分之四点五至十三点五。察南、雁北有桑乾河、浑河等大小河流可资利用，但目前尚未开发，又因敌伪压榨破坏，有不少渠道荒废失效。四、五分区之正定水地占其全部耕地面积百分之八十九点六，行唐水地占其全部耕地面积百分之三十五点四，其他各县则相差甚远。据十二县不完整调查，共有约百万亩以上的旱地可凿井灌溉，变为水田。现在有水车、水井的地区，存在着井多水车少的情况，坏井和坏水车也有一部。根据上述情况，北岳行署又制订今年水利建设计划，确定今年的大生产，应以大力广泛兴修水利为主要课题之一。就地区上说，则应以察南、雁北为重点，察南、雁北又应以恢复旧有水利、广泛开修费劲较小而获利很大的洪水渠，放淤改良土壤为主。四、五分区之平原地区则以凿井、按修水车、巩固旧有水利、加强大渠渠道管理为主。号召各地开渠灌溉向四分区看齐，水车、水井向正定看齐。修堤筑坝，疏水防洪则为各地水利建设中的经常任务。根据工作基础、群众力量、干部条件及洪水放淤情况，各项水利建设具体要求如下：一、六道大渠计划扩大水地四万五千亩，计广济渠两万亩，利民渠两千五百亩，农业渠两千五百亩，东胜渠两千亩，荣臻渠一万亩（增加春秋二次用水），计三渠八千亩。二、开整新渠计划扩大水利六万亩，计一专区两万一千亩，三专区一万二千亩，四专区七千亩，五专区三千亩，六专区一万七千亩。三、恢复旧渠扩大水利四万亩，计一专区两万五千五百亩，三专区三千五百亩，四专区三千亩，六专区八千亩。四、凿井一千眼，扩大水利两万五千亩，计四专区三百眼，扩大水利七千五百亩，五专区七百眼，扩大水利一万七千五百亩。增按水车三千一百五十架，一千架按装于新井，两千一百五十架按补旧井，每架扩大水地十亩，共扩大水地两万一千五百亩。计四专区一千架，五专区两千一百五十架。五、旧有坏水车要求尽量全部恢复，修理水车应成为经常工作。以上五项合计，明年全区要求扩大水利二十万亩。六、要求各地普遍深入的教育群众，克服侥幸心理和听天由命思想，修筑堤坝，进行长期防洪建设，树立人定胜天的观念。为全部实现上列计划，各级领导机关必须：（一）把水利建设列为生产领导上主要议事日程，召开水利座谈会，派专人调查勘测，具体掌握情况，进一步继续进行冬季水利准备工作（计划工程，健全组织，解决问题，准备工料等），奠定今年兴修发展的基础。（二）加强水利建设的计划性，克服技术困难，各地根据需要，大力网罗当地土专家，大胆使用土专家，勘计各项较小的工程，做出具体计划来，加强组织工作，交付具体任务，指定专人负责，技术干部与行政干部必须密切结合，统一进行。（三）特大的工程，行署负责勘计，或请华北政府协助进行。（四）工程较大，群众力量不足，可请示贷款补助。（北岳行署农林处）
