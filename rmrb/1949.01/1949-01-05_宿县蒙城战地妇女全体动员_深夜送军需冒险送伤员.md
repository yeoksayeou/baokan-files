Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 26th: The women of the Su County Mengcheng war zone enthusiastically helped the People's Liberation Army in the campaign to annihilate Huang Wei's army corps. In various villages in the area, residents feared the Kuomintang bandits would forcibly conscript them, so all the men fled, leaving only a few old women and young girls at home to watch the doors. When the People's Liberation Army was stationed in these villages, the women immediately mobilized to boil water, grind flour, and guide the way for the PLA. On the night of the 28th of last month, the Third Company of a certain regiment of our army borrowed a cartload of wooden stakes from Wangmiao and urgently needed to transport them to various locations to build fortifications. However, they could not find any men to drive the cart, nor were there any livestock available. At this time, a woman in her twenties, who was grinding flour for the PLA, learned of this and immediately unharnessed the livestock from the mill and drove the large cart, braving the cold wind and the enemy's strafing and bombing, delivering the supplies to the front line overnight. Most touching was that during the battle at Huangjia, several seriously wounded soldiers from a certain unit of the PLA crawled into the village to rest. After the women of the village saw them, they immediately prepared stretchers and gathered a group of old women and young girls, risking danger to carry them all the way to the PLA's position. They comforted the wounded soldiers, saying, "You are risking your lives and shedding blood to fight Old Chiang for us, so it is right for us to carry you." The wounded soldiers were all moved to tears. One soldier said, "These are truly the People's Liberation Army's own mothers." An old woman in Chen Weizi, over sixty years old, immediately handed over two rocket launcher rounds after seeing our troops, excitedly saying, "These were discarded by the bandit troops when they fled and I picked them up from the roadside. Take them and use them to hit those bad seeds!"

　　宿县蒙城战地妇女全体动员
  　深夜送军需冒险送伤员
    【新华社中原二十六日电】宿县蒙城战地妇女在解放军歼灭黄维兵团的战役中，热情地帮助解放军作战。该地各村居民惧怕蒋匪拉夫抓兵，所有男人全部外逃，只剩下少数老太婆和小女孩在家看门。当解放军驻到这些村庄后，她们马上就全体动员起来，为解放军烧水、磨面、带路。上月二十八日夜，我某团三连在王庙借好一车木桩，急需运到各处构筑工事，但是找不到男人来赶车，又没有牲口。这时，一个正在给解放军磨面的二十多岁的妇女知道了，马上把套在磨上的牲口卸下来，赶着大车，冒着寒风和敌机的扫射轰炸，连夜送到火线上。最使人感动的是在黄家战斗中，解放军某部有几个重伤员爬到村里去休息，被该村妇女看见后，她们马上就绑好担架，集合了一伙老太太和小姑娘，冒着危险一直抬送到解放军阵地上。她们安慰伤员们说：“你们为我们拼命流血打老蒋，抬你们这是应该的。”伤员们都感动得流下泪来。一个战士说：“这真是人民解放军的亲娘。”陈围子一个六十多岁的老太太见到我军后，立即交出两枚火箭筒弹，兴奋地说：“这是匪军逃跑时丢在路边给我抬起来的，你们拿去，好打那些坏种！”
