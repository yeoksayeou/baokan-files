Chapter I General Principles

Article 1 This League is named the China New Democratic Youth League.

Article 2 This League is a mass organization of all advanced youth who are willing to strive for the thorough realization of New Democracy. It educates its members with the unified thought of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution, and unites all democratic youth organizations and the broad masses of youth throughout the country, together with the people of the whole country, to thoroughly overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism in China; to fight for the construction of an independent, peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and unified People's Republic of China and the thorough victory of New Democracy; and to unite all anti-fascist youth organizations in the world to fight for lasting world peace and people's democracy, and for the complete liberation of all mankind.

Article 3 The basic tasks of this League are the following four:

(1) In various constructions of the People's Democratic Republic, in various works and mass movements called for by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government, League members should use their exemplary actions to influence and lead the broad masses of youth to actively participate, become a shock force among the people and a powerful assistant to the People's Democratic Government. At present, the focus of the League's work should be on participating in the People's Liberation War and developing production in the liberated areas.

(2) On the basis of the overall interests of the people, with the organized efforts of the youth themselves, carry forward the youth's love of labor, solidarity, mutual assistance and spirit of creation, and strive for the various basic and special living benefits of the youth.
