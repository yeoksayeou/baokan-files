Taihang Xinhua Daily Editorial Advocates Protecting Workers' Legitimate Interests; Certain Capitalists Not Allowed to Infringe Unreasonably
Xingtai Private Tobacco Shops Illegally Retaliate Against Workers

[Taihang Telegraph] The Taihang Xinhua Daily, regarding the actions of capitalists of private tobacco shops such as Jiuxingwu in Xingtai City, who violated the government's policy of benefiting both labor and capital by infringing on workers' legitimate interests, published a short article titled "Protecting Workers' Legitimate Interests," stating: "The capitalists of private tobacco shops such as Jiuxingwu, Jicheng, and Shanxingcheng in Xingtai City are violating the government's policy of benefiting both labor and capital. They continue to use old and unreasonable systems to infringe on workers' legitimate interests and retaliate against workers, with illegal acts such as unjustified dismissals. This should attract our utmost attention. The policy of benefiting both labor and capital requires, on the one hand, that capitalists obtain legitimate profits, and on the other hand, that workers' legitimate interests be guaranteed. In implementing the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, workers must play a leading and exemplary role. No one is allowed to violate this policy. The Xingtai Municipal Government should, in accordance with the law, take necessary actions against the aforementioned illegal acts of the capitalists. All worker comrades in Xingtai City should unite and organize to wage necessary struggles against those capitalists who violate government policies and infringe on workers' interests, in order to implement government policies and defend their legitimate interests. The Xingtai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions must play a leading role in this struggle and must recognize that only when workers are organized and united, becoming the active force in implementing policies, can the implementation of policies be guaranteed."

　　太行新华日报著论主张
  　保护工人正当利益
  　不容某些资方无理侵犯
    邢台私营烟店非法报复工人
    【太行电】太行新华日报，对于邢市久兴武等私营烟店违犯政府劳资两利政策侵犯工人正当利益的行为，发表题为“保护工人的正当利益”的短论称：邢台市久兴武、积成、善兴成等私营烟店的资方，违犯政府劳资两利的政策，仍以旧的不合理的制度侵犯工人正当利益以及报复工人，无理解雇等非法行为，应当引起我们极大的注视。劳资两利的政策是一方面要使资方获有正当的利润，一方面必须保证工人的正当利益。在执行发展生产和劳资两利的政策中，工人要起领导的与模范的作用，决不允许任何人违犯这个政策。对于上述资方的违法行为，邢台市政府应当依法给以必要的处置。邢市全体工人同志应当团结起来，组织起来，为贯彻政府的政策，为保卫自己的正当利益，向那些违犯政府政策侵害工人利益的资方进行必要的斗争，邢市工会在这种斗争中必需起领导作用，必须认识只有工人组织起来，团结起来，成为执行政策的主动力量时，政策的执行才有保证。
