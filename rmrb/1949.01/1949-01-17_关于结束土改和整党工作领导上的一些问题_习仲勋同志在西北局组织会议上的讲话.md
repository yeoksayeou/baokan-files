　　On Some Leadership Issues Concerning the Conclusion of Land Reform and Party Rectification Work
  　Comrade Xi Zhongxun's Speech at the Northwest Bureau Organizational Meeting
    Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech at the Northwest Bureau Organizational Meeting on December 4th of last year regarding some leadership issues in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region since last autumn in concluding land reform and party rectification work. The full text is as follows:
    As everyone knows, the current revolutionary situation is developing rapidly. We must clearly see the development of the situation in our work, proceed from the development of the situation in everything, seize the opportunity firmly, and make the necessary preparations. Otherwise, we will lag behind, become opportunists, and make big mistakes. What preparations? The two most important things are cadres and policies. The various issues we are discussing at this meeting are for this purpose. The situation is developing so rapidly that a few months are equal to the past many years. We must do the work of a few days in one day, the work of a few people in one person, and do a lot of practical work to catch up. Some people often like to argue about small things right under their noses, haggling over personal gains and losses, this length and that shortness, and do not think about the big things of millions of people. They seem to have nothing to do, but they do not know that there are many big things waiting for us to do. Some leading organs are still unable to consider problems comprehensively, taking a long-term and broad view, considering what are the main problems in the work they manage? How to arrange these problems? They are still entangled in trivial matters. If this continues, they will forever fall into the mire of bureaucratism and will always be unable to keep up. Now many of our party's leading organs are always running after affairs, replacing mass organizations; replacing government organs; replacing the affairs of administrative departments. This actually reduces the party's leadership level and weakens the party's leadership role. The party's leadership is to educate the various organizations and activists of the working people, to transform the party's policies into the will of the people, to point out the direction to them, to lead and organize them to struggle, and to improve their fighting enthusiasm and working ability. But many of our party's leading organizations are often not good at doing this. If comrades of the prefectural and county committees go down to the countryside and do not specifically lead the local organizations and cadres, help them summarize experience, find ways to solve difficulties with them, correct their mistakes, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the local party, cadres, and masses, teach them to improve, and use the experience there to guide other places, but instead take care of everything, is that not reducing their own leadership responsibilities? If the work team goes down and replaces the work of the peasant association and even the peasant activists, is that not weakening its own leadership role? This is the biggest weakness in everything we do now. Since this is the case, the result must be a lot of busywork and even getting lost. The leading comrades in many places are shouting "This year's work is busy, the ability of the cadres is limited, and they can't do it," for example, the leading comrades in the Guanzhong sub-region said so. Therefore, it is proposed that the old areas cannot complete the work of ending land reform and party rectification, and can only complete the small part of the mountainous area first. Some sub-regions do not plan to complete the work of ending land reform and party rectification before March next year. May I ask, this year's work is busy, when will our work not be busy? If we do not seize the time to do these tasks well in the old areas, lay the foundation for rural work and the great production movement next year, truly mobilize the peasant masses, strengthen unity, and train a large number of new cadres, then how is it possible to draw greater strength to strengthen the work in the new areas? We must not lose our way and do our work accurately in order to adapt to the development of the objective situation.
    It has been nearly three months since the end of land reform and party rectification work began this winter. Why have various places not reported the situation or reported very little? Now there are only some reports on how to arrange work, or only questions such as how to calculate the amount of exploitation and land grades. How is the movement progressing? What are the problems in the middle? What are the dynamics of the masses? But there is still very little reflection. I think the basic problem is still that a truly mass movement has not been launched. What is the problem? Until now, various places are still stagnating in small-scale "pilot projects." Many places are afraid of not completing the task, so they divide this autumn and winter's work into many phases, and only carry out one phase in a part of the area. They did not regard the conclusion of land reform, party rectification, convening of township and county people's congresses, adjustment of burdens, and preparation for production as a series of interconnected tasks in this autumn and winter, and that they should be completed universally in the basic areas. At the Northwest Bureau's July meeting, we took into account the shortage of cadre strength and agreed to divide it into two phases. But if you think that phasing is the main way to complete the work, then that is not appropriate. If it is divided into three or even four phases, from October to March next year, six months, each phase will only be two months or even forty-odd days. How can such a short period of time do such a series of tasks well? Even if the work is completed, it is only completed in form. The more phases there are, the easier it is to produce formalism. Of course, land reform and party rectification work must be mastered by strong cadres who really understand the policies, but it does not mean that these few cadres sent out should take care of everything. Only a few cadres do it, leaving most other village cadres (not to mention the masses) aside, so how can we lay a good foundation for rural work? The important thing is to explain the policies to all cadres, and the leading organs should appropriately coordinate and closely connect with the movements in various places, teach them methods at any time, and give them specific guidance. After starting from some places, the movement should be universally launched. The leading organs can personally guide a few places with emphasis, as examples, draw experience, and use it to guide other places at any time. In fact, the mass movement must and will inevitably be unfolded through the masses' own experience and through the masses themselves. Like Yilipu in Yan'an County, when the movement was launched, the surrounding villages wanted to follow suit when they saw it, so we should let the movement unfold and send people to lead it. As long as there is correct leadership, there will be no chaos. But some comrades do not do that. They insist on waiting for a part of the area to be completed before starting to do it in other areas, and they insist on replacing the lively mass movement with the rigid plan they came up with in the house. This time, the "first phase" "pilot project", also called "typical pilot project", is done in isolation, and can be said to be a typical for the sake of typical, so that the typical loses its role. The secretary of the Mizhi County Party Committee piloted a township, and the deputy county magistrate also piloted a township. For dozens of days, no one knew how the other was doing, and there was no contact with each other. This situation of no contact exists everywhere. Some divide land work and party rectification work, and in the first phase of Yan'an County, ten townships were run, and seven townships only did land work and did not do party rectification work. Some divide land and party rectification work from other work, doing them piece by piece like small stove craftsmen. Some counties uniformly stipulate that propaganda will be done for a few days, investigation will be done for a few days, and then what will be done for a few days, etc. It seems scientific, but it is not based on the actual needs of the masses. They mechanically separate stages to do work. In the "propaganda stage", the masses proposed to discuss the issue of cadres. They said: "Wait a minute, we will raise it when we rectify the party," and insisted that the masses wait for their subjectively set plan. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses cooled down later. It is not to say here that we should not have a plan for our work. On the contrary, we require various places to explain to all cadres what work will be done this autumn and winter? How are these works related? Each village should organically link the work to be carried out according to the actual situation in the local area, so that the central and secondary work can be closely coordinated. In this way, there will be no random work without a center. But the point of "according to the actual situation in the local area" must be paid attention to. The issues that the masses in each village and each period urgently require are different, and we must never use a plan to apply everywhere. We must start from solving the most urgent issues of the local masses, and at the same time, modify the established plan at any time according to the development of the mass movement, and fully mobilize the masses to complete all the work. What many local cadres are doing now is not mobilizing the masses to form a mass movement; but taking care of everything and working in order to "complete the task" in form. This is the basic error. When Li Jiaqu in Yan'an held a party rectification meeting, the branch secretary was dozing off on the side and did not know what party rectification had to do with him. Instead, he said: "This work has been delayed all along." In this way, not only were the masses not mobilized, but even the party members and village cadres were not mobilized. The slow progress of work in various places, and even a bit of stagnation, is the result of erroneous leadership methods. The reasons for the emergence of these erroneous leadership methods are mainly the lack of a clear understanding of the center and the connection between this series of tasks of land reform, party rectification, government building, and preparation for the great production next year. What is the purpose of carrying out this string of work in the two seasons of autumn and winter this year? In a word, it is to mobilize and unite the rural working people to restore and develop production and strive for the victory of the revolutionary war. For example, the purpose of party rectification is to strengthen the close connection between the party and the masses and strengthen the party's leadership role among the rural masses. That is to say, party rectification is for the purpose of vigorously mobilizing the peasant masses, solving the land problem, developing the production problem, supporting the war problem, expanding rural democracy problem, and increasing the rural unity problem. Without party rectification, these problems cannot be solved well. That is to say, if we do not mobilize the masses inside and outside the party from these issues and combine them to carry out the party rectification movement, party rectification will not be done well. When the masses in Yilipu began to demand to solve the problem of cadres, we started from this, and as a result, the masses were quickly mobilized, raising more than 180 issues, and the masses themselves solved them all, and solved them very well. The consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses have been greatly improved, and many activists have emerged, forming the core. Then, the work of grain requisitioning, land adjustment, transformation of hooligans, and preparation for production were all carried out very well. This is both central and coordinated. The ideological essence of the erroneous leadership methods mentioned above is not to believe in the masses, not to understand that the masses can solve all problems when they are mobilized, and not to understand that the masses are the source of all strength. This way of thinking violates the Marxist way of thinking, only seeing the phenomenon without seeing the essence of things through the phenomenon; only looking at problems in isolation, without finding the connection between various problems; only seeing the present, without seeing the future; only seeking to complete the task in form, without thinking that the more important thing is to lay a good foundation for the progress of the work. The root cause is empiricism at work.
    It is obvious that we must quickly reverse the above-mentioned leadership thinking and strengthen the party's political and organizational work. Various places must seriously and deeply examine themselves and improve the leadership of the work. This is a crucial link. From now until March next year, there are about four months. We must universally carry out land work and party rectification work, no longer in phases, and teach every cadre to conduct land work and party rectification work, and mobilize the vast masses inside and outside the party to do it. According to the situation in the old areas, mobilizing the masses to carry out democratic movements is the fundamental key to doing a good job in land reform, party rectification, and all other work. The criterion for checking work should be how well the masses are mobilized and how well various problems in the rural masses are solved. We must change the face of rural work from thoroughly solving all the problems of the rural masses, and promote a large number of new cadres. All work must be closely combined with the work of restoring and developing production. If production is neglected, the work will lose its direction. In order to solve the close connection and timely guidance of the movement, in terms of leadership methods, the local committees and county committees must assign four or five to six or seven responsible cadres who can represent the local committees and county committees to inspect separately, discover problems at any time, solve problems, and help various places summarize experience and exchange experience, so that the party's leading organs can understand the development of the movement at any time, seize every important link in the current movement, and effectively push the movement forward.

　　关于结束土改和整党工作领导上的一些问题
  　习仲勋同志在西北局组织会议上的讲话
    中国共产党西北中央局书记习仲勋同志去年十二月四日在西北局组织会议上，对于陕甘宁边区自去秋以来在结束土地改革和整党工作领导上的一些问题发表讲话。全文如下：
    大家已经知道，目前革命形势正飞速地发展着。我们做工作必须看清局势的发展，一切都要从发展的情况出发，紧紧把握时机，做好必要的准备。否则，我们就会落后，变成机会主义者，犯大错误。准备什么？首要的两件即干部和政策。我们这次会议讨论的各项问题，都是为此。时局发展得如此迅速，几个月等于过去多少年，我们要一天做几天的事，一个人做几个人的事，做好许多实际工作，才能赶得上。有些人常常喜欢争执鼻子尖下面的小事情，斤斤计较个人得失，这长那短，并不去想到千百万人的大事情。他们好象无事可做，而不知道等着我们去做的事情很大很多。有些领导机关也还不能通盘考虑问题，从远处大处着眼，考虑那些是自己所管理的工作中的主要问题？如何去安排这些问题？仍然是来什么做什么，甚至老是在琐屑事务中间纠缠。这样下去就会永远坠落在事务主义的泥坑里，老是踏不上脚步。现在我们许多党的领导机关，老是跟在事务后面跑，代替了群众组织；代替了政府机关；代替了事务部门的事情。这实际是降低了党的领导水平，减弱了党的领导作用。党的领导就是去教育劳动人民的各种组织和积极分子，把党的政策变为人民大众的意志，给他们指出方向，带领和组织他们斗争，提高他们的斗争热情和工作能力。但我们许多党的领导组织往往不善于这样做。地委、县委的同志下到乡里，如果不是具体领导当地的组织和干部，帮助他们总结经验，有困难便和他们设法解决，有错误便给他们指拨过来，充分发动当地的党、干部和群众的积极性，教他们提高一步，并拿那里的经验去推广指导其他各地，而事事包办代替，那不就是降低了自己的领导职责么？工作团下去，代替了农会甚至农民积极分子的工作，也不就是减弱了自己的领导作用么？这就是现在我们一切事情中最大的弱点。既然如此，结果就一定是乱忙，甚至迷失了方向。好些地方的领导同志都大叫“今年工作繁忙，干部能力有限，做不过来”，例如关中分区的领导同志们就是这样说的。因而提出老区也不能全部办好结束土地改革和整党工作，只能先完成山地那一小部分，有些分区也都不打算在明年三月前完成结束土地改革工作和整党工作。试问，今年工作繁忙，到什么时候我们工作才不繁忙呢？如果我们不争取时间把老区这些工作做好，打下老区农村工作和明年大生产运动的基础，把农民群众确实发动起来，加强团结，并培养大批新的干部，又有什么可能抽出更大的力量去加强新区工作呢？我们必须不迷失方向，工作作得准确，以便适应客观形势的发展。
    今冬结束土地改革工作和整党工作已开始将近三个月，为什么各地一直没有或者很少反映情况？现在有的只是一些如何布置工作的报告，或者只是提出如何计算剥削分量、土地等级之类的问题。究竟运动进行得如何？中间有什么问题？群众动态如何？却还反映得很少。我看，基本问题还是没有搞起一个真正群众性的运动。毛病何在？直到现在，各地都还停滞在小范围的“试办”里。好些地方怕完不成任务，就把今年秋冬工作分成许多期，一期只在一部分地区进行。没有把结束土地改革、整党、召开乡、县人民代表大会、调整负担以及准备生产等项工作看作是今年秋冬两季的一系列互相联结的工作，并且是要在基本区内普遍完成的。西北局七月会议上曾经照顾干部力量不足，同意了分作两期进行。但如果以为分期就是完成工作的主要办法，那就不恰当了。如象分三期甚至四期，从十月到明年三月六个月时间，分起来每期只有两个月甚至四十多天。这样短促的时间，如何能把这样一系列的工作做好？即使工作完成了，也只是形式上完成。分期越多就越容易产生形式主义。固然，土地改革、整党工作必须有确实懂得政策的坚强的干部去掌握，但并不等于由这少数派去的干部去包办。只有少数干部去做，把其他大多数乡村干部（更不用说群众了）搁在一旁，又如何能打好农村工作的基础？重要的是把政策向所有干部讲清楚，领导机关适当地配合和密切地联系各地的运动，随时教给办法，给以具体的指导。开始从一部分地方做开之后，便应把运动普遍展开。领导机关可以有重点地亲自指导几处地方，作为典型，得出经验，随时用来指导其他地方。其实群众运动必须是也必然是通过群众亲身的经验，通过群众自己去展开。象延安县一里铺，运动搞开了，周围的乡村看见都想照办，那我们就应放手让运动展开，派人去领导。只要有正确领导，是不会出乱子的。但是有的同志却不那样做。硬要等一部分地方做完了再开始到其他地方去做，硬把自己在屋子里想出来的死板计划去代替活泼的群众运动。这次“第一期”“试办”，又叫“典型试办”，都是孤立地在那里做，可说是为典型而典型，使典型失掉了作用。米脂县委书记试办一个乡，副县长也试办一个乡，好几十天谁也不知道谁做得怎样，互不联系，这种不联系的情形，到处都有。有的把土地工作和整党工作分割开来，延安县第一期办十个乡，就有七个乡只办土地工作不做整党工作。有的把土地及整党工作和其他工作分割开来，象小炉匠一样一件一件地零做。有些县份一律规定宣传几天，调查几天，然后什么什么几天等等。看来好象得科学，其实并不是从群众实际要求出发的。他们机械地分开阶段做工作，在“宣传阶段”，群众提出要讨论干部问题，他们说：“等一等，到整党时再提”，硬要群众等他们那个主观订好的计划，于是到后来群众的热情就凉了。这里不是说，我们工作不要有个计划。相反，我们要求各地要把今年秋冬有那些工作？这些工作中间关联如何？向所有干部讲清楚，各个乡村分别按照当地实际情况，把要执行的工作有机联系起来，使中心与次要工作密切配合进行，这样才不至于没有中心地乱做。但“按照当地实际情况”这点必须注意，每一乡村每一时期群众当前迫切要求的问题都不一样，绝不能拿一个计划到处去套，必须从解决当地群众最迫切的问题入手，同时按照群众运动发展随时修改已定的计划，把群众充分发动起来去完成所有工作。现在许多地方干部所做的，不是发动群众，形成群众运动；而是包办代替，为了在形式上“完成任务”而工作。这就是基本错误的所在。延安李家渠开整党会议时，支部书记在一旁打瞌睡，并不晓得整党和他有什么关系，反说：“这一向工作都耽搁了。”这样不但群众没有发动起来，连党员和乡村干部都没有发动起来。各地工作进度很慢，简直有点里足不前，正是领导方法错误的结果。产生这些错误领导方法的原因，主要是对土改、整党、建政和准备明年大生产这一系列工作的中心和其间的联系缺乏确切的了解。今年秋冬两季进行这一串工作为的是什么？一句话，发动和团结农村劳动人民恢复和发展生产，争取革命战争的胜利。比如整党，其目的在于密切党和群众的联系，加强党在农村群众中的领导作用。就是说，整党为的有力地发动农民群众，解决土地问题，发展生产问题，支援战争问题，扩大农村民主问题，增加农村团结问题。不整党，这些问题都不可能很好地解决。这也就是说，如果不从这些问题上发动党内外群众，结合开展整党运动，整党也整不好。一里铺群众开始要求解决干部问题，我们就从这上面入手，结果群众很快地就发动起来，提出一百八十多件问题，并由群众自己把它通统解决了，而且解决的很好。群众的觉悟和热情大大提高，出现了不少积极分子，形成了核心。接着征粮、调剂土地、改造二流子、准备生产等等工作都进行得很好。这样就是既有中心又有配合。前面说的错误的领导方法的思想实质，就是不相信群众，不懂得群众发动起来了便可以解决一切问题，不懂得群众就是一切力量的源泉。这种思想方法是违反马克思主义的思想方法，只看到现象没有透过现象看到事物的本质；只孤立看问题，没有找出各种问题中间的联系；只看见现在，没有看见将来；只求形式上完成任务，没有想到更重要的是为工作前进打好基础。其根源又是经验主义在作怪。
    很明显地，我们必须迅速扭转上述的领导思想，加强党的政治和组织工作。各地必须认真深刻检讨一番，改善工作的领导，这是有决定意义的一环。从现在起到明年三月约有四个月时间，必须普遍开展土地工作和整党工作，不要再分期，要教会每个干部都会进行土地工作和整党工作，要发动党内外广大群众起来办。依据老区情况，发动群众进行民主运动是做好土改、整党以及其他一切工作的根本关键。检查工作应以群众发动的程度如何，农村群众中各种问题解决的程度如何为准绳。我们要从彻底地解决农村群众的一切问题中，改变农村工作的面貌，并提拔大批新的干部。所有工作都必须紧紧和恢复并发展生产工作结合。忽视生产，工作就会失去方向。为了解决密切联系和及时指导运动的进行，在领导方法上，各地委和县委必须指派四五个到六七个能够代表地委和县委的负责干部，分头巡视，随时发现问题，解决问题，帮助各地总结经验，交流经验，这样使党的领导机关，随时了解运动发展的情况，抓住当前运动的每一重要环节，有效地把运动推向前进。
