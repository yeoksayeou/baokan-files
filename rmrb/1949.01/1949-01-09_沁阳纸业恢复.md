【Taihang Telegram】The folk yellow (straw paper) and white (hemp paper) industry in Qinyang County has now resumed production. The county is quite famous for its yellow and white paper industry, with most of the people in eight administrative villages such as Niezhang relying on papermaking for a living. Before the war, there were 1,300 paper soaking pools. After the Japanese devils occupied the area, it was severely devastated, with the paper drying walls collapsing and eight miles of the paper soaking river being silted up, resulting in most production being halted. Since liberation, it has gradually recovered. According to statistics from September of this year, it has increased to 297 pools. However, because it was previously (November 1946) located in a border area, it was often disturbed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, which greatly affected sales. Since the liberation of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and other places, sales have expanded, and many people have spontaneously gathered materials and repaired pools to prepare for a major effort. In Niezhang Village, three to five households voluntarily combined, increasing from eleven paper pools to thirty. In addition, more than 100 households who do not soak paper are also peeling tree bark (papermaking raw material) for sale, and 400 catties have already been peeled. Shuitun Village has also restored 57 paper pools. In order to restore papermaking work, Longquan Village is digging out paper soaking pools, and 30 pools have already resumed work. In order to support the development of the people's paper industry, the county bank has issued loans of 10,800 yuan to support the paper industry. At present, the villages are actively carrying out production recovery construction, some steaming straw (wheat stalks), some repairing walls, and women and children drying paper, working very enthusiastically.

　　沁阳纸业恢复
    【太行电】沁阳县民间黄（草纸）白（麻纸）纸业，现已恢复生产。该县黄白纸业颇有名，捏掌等八个行政村群众大部依靠造纸为生。战前共有涝纸池一千三百个。日寇占领后横遭摧残，晒纸墙倒塌、涝纸河被淤八里，因而大部停止生产。解放后，即逐渐恢复。据今年九月份统计，已增至二百九十七个池子。但因过去（一九四六年十一月）地处边沿区，常受蒋匪扰乱，因而销路大受影响。自开封、郑州等地解放后，扩大了销路，很多群众自动集料，修池准备大干。捏掌村三家五家的自愿结合，已由十一个纸池增加到三十个。另有一百余户不涝纸的，也在剥树皮（造纸原料）出卖，现已剥下四百斤。水屯村也恢复了五十七个纸池。龙泉村为了恢复造纸工作，正在挑涝纸池，已有三十个池复工。该县银行为了扶助群众纸业的发展，特发贷款一万零八百元扶助纸业。现各村正积极进行恢复生产的建设，有的蒸秸（麦秆），有的修墙，老婆小孩晒纸，干的十分起劲。
