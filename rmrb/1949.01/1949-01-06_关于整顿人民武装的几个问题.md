　　Several Questions Regarding the Rectification of the People's Armed Forces
    Ji Peizhi
    In order to vigorously support the front, ensure public security, and strengthen the struggle against the enemy, the People's Armed Forces Department of the North China Military Region has issued winter work instructions. Various regions have successively deployed this work and are currently implementing it, with most areas in progress. The following are several questions for research regarding the work of rectifying the organization.
    I. The General Purpose and General Requirements of Rectifying the Organization
    The five requirements for organizational rectification in the winter work instructions of the People's Armed Forces Department of the North China Military Region are the general requirements and general purpose of organizational rectification. There are two basic contents: One is organizational rectification, that is, restoring, establishing and improving organizations and leading bodies, equipping cadres completely, and conducting organization and development; cleaning out individual worst elements, reactionary despotic landlords and rich peasants from the militia, and thoroughly investigating, registering and controlling weapons, and establishing a weapon custody system. This is a major aspect of the work of rectifying the organization. The second is to strengthen education, improve ideological style, rectify discipline, overcome the extreme democratization, lack of organization, lack of discipline, anarchic attitude of cadres and team members, as well as the serious style of detachment from the masses, improve the political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and team members, and strengthen unity, so that the people's armed forces can improve ideologically and politically.
    Although the above two contents have major and minor distinctions, they are combined and indispensable. Therefore, some areas only propose to reorganize the organization, neglecting to strengthen education, transform style, rectify discipline, and neglect to establish the stretcher teams, transport teams, and militia teams to support the front. These are all incorrect and should be checked and corrected.
    II. The Guidelines and Practices for Strengthening Education, Improving Style, and Rectifying Discipline
    The people's armed forces - militia and self-defense force organizations - have party members and non-party members, and are mass armed organizations that are not detached from production. Regarding the issue of education in the people's armed forces, party members in the people's armed forces should unconditionally participate in the party rectification of the branch, and non-party members should also receive education on the party's class policies and style. This is one aspect; at the same time, in the people's armed forces organizations, it is also required to strengthen education to transform ideology and rectify discipline in or around party rectification, adopt the policy and practice of combining criticism and self-criticism, organizational life review meetings, and education, to improve their political awareness. For example, Taihang proposed a three-evaluation (evaluate oneself, evaluate others, evaluate leadership) and four-record (record whether the task is completed, how it is performed in completing the task, how to help others, how to abide by discipline) movement in supporting the front: Jizhong Sub-district proposed three comparisons (compare work, compare production, compare discipline), etc., which can be adopted.
    When evaluating, recording, and comparing good and bad, the good should be praised and called on everyone to learn; for the bad, it is necessary to distinguish right from wrong, public from private, the size of the error, point out the degree of harm and corrective measures, and encourage overcoming.
    However, some areas have put forward overly high and left-leaning guidelines and practices: such as "three checks and three rectifications (check ideology, check style, check fighting spirit, rectify ideology, rectify style, rectify discipline)", "rectify like the party", "evaluate composition", etc., which are wrong, and are dogmatism of moving the experience of party rectification, which will result in village cadres and militia resisting negatively, the organization disintegrating, weapons being damaged, and affecting the completion of the tasks of supporting the front, participating in the war, and maintaining social security.
    III. The Composition of the People's Armed Forces
    The people's armed forces are also for the purpose of carrying out the proletarian-led, worker-peasant-based anti-imperialist and anti-feudal new democratic revolution, and their organizational composition should naturally be suitable for this general task. Therefore, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Except for the old, the young, the sick, and the infirm, all male and female citizens should be organized into the self-defense army, and the elite should be selected from the self-defense army to organize the militia or the backbone army." According to this principle, the organizational members of the people's armed forces should be: Self-defense forces: All citizens aged eighteen to fifty-five and those over fifty-five with relatively strong physical strength, without illness or disability, regardless of class or race, should be organized into the self-defense forces. In order to facilitate support for the front, stretchers and transport teams should be formed scientifically and systematically in an administrative village, and several echelons should be formed at the district level in order to rotate support for the front. Militia: All men aged eighteen to thirty-five without illness, except for saboteurs (including those who have been spies or cadres above platoon level in the enemy camp), reactionary despotic landlords, rich peasants, and hooligans, can be mobilized to participate in the militia on a voluntary basis after examination by the farmers' association and approval by the higher authorities. The number of militia should generally be at least 5% of the local population. Women's militia will no longer be developed, and the existing ones will be gradually abolished.
    By doing so, some landlords and rich peasants may participate in the militia, which is not terrible; but it must be noted that the leading backbone must be politically reliable to ensure the absolute leadership of the party, and weapons must be in the hands of reliable elements. In some areas, "to evaluate the composition of the militia", all landlords and rich peasants are cleaned out of the militia, "excluding and cleaning middle peasant components from the militia", "mistaking middle peasants and not restoring their militia qualifications", etc., are all left-leaning closed-doorist erroneous views and practices. However, some armed organizations neglect the absolute leadership of the party, violate the principle of being based on workers and peasants as the backbone, and the weapons are not really in the hands of reliable elements, etc., which are also wrong. In addition, some cadres advocate abolishing the people's armed forces, which is a very dangerous paralyzing thought of disarming themselves. Due to paralysis, serious events such as traitors, hooligans, and reactionary elements infiltrating the organization, resulting in betrayal, theft, robbery, and sabotage have occurred, and these bloody lessons should arouse vigilance and be overcome quickly.
    IV. The Issue of Combining with the Central Work
    In addition to retaining a certain number of people to persist in their work and participate in the war, the remaining cadres of the People's Armed Forces are uniformly assigned by the organization, and armed cadres are equipped in each base point in order to take care of daily work (such as supporting the front, maintaining public security, etc.).

　　关于整顿人民武装的几个问题
    吉佩祉
    为了大力支前确保治安加强对敌斗争，华北军区人民武装部已发出冬季工作指示，各区先后都布置了这一工作，现在正在贯彻，大部地区在进行中。现就整顿组织工作提出以下几个问题来研究。
    一、整顿组织的总目的和总要求
    华北军区人民武装部冬季工作指示中，整顿组织要求的五条，就是整顿组织的总要求和总目的，其中有两个基本内容：一是从组织上整顿，即恢复建立与健全组织及领导机构，配备齐全干部，进行编制与发展组织；在民兵中清洗个别最坏分子、反动恶霸的地主富农分子，并确实清查与登记、掌握武器，建立武器保管制度，这是整顿组织工作主要一方面。二是加强教育，改善思想作风，整顿纪律，克服干部队员极端民主化的无组织无纪律无政府态度，以及脱离群众的严重作风，提高干部队员的政治觉悟与革命热情，加强团结，使人民武装从思想上政治上都提高一步。
    以上这两个内容虽有主要次要之分，但又是结合的，缺一不可的。因此有个别地区只提出整理组织，忽视加强教育，改造作风，整顿纪律以及忽视建立支前的担架队、运输队、民兵队的布置等，都是不对的，应检查纠正。
    二、关于加强教育、改善作风，整顿纪律的方针与作法
    人民武装——民兵、自卫队组织中有党员与非党员群众，是不脱离生产的群众性的武装组织。关于人民武装教育问题，人民武装中党员应无条件的参加支部整党，非党队员也应受到党的阶级政策与作风的教育，这是一方面；同时在人民武装组织中，也要求在整党中或整党前后进行加强教育改造思想，整顿纪律的工作，采取批评与自我批评，组织生活检讨会，与教育相结合的方针与做法，提高其政治觉悟。如太行在支前中提出三评（评自己、评别人、评领导）四记（记完成任务没有，在完成任务中表现如何，帮助别人怎样，遵守纪律怎样）运动：冀中十分区提出三比（比工作，比生产，比纪律）等，都可采用。
    在评、记、比好坏时，好的要表扬，号召大家学习；对坏的要分清是非，为公为私，错误大小，指出危害程度与纠正办法，鼓励克服。
    但有的地区提出过高过左的方针与做法：如“三查三整（查思想、查作风、查斗志、整思想、整作风、整纪律）”，“和党一样整”、“评成份”等，则是错误的，是搬用整党经验的教条主义，结果会使村干民兵消极抵抗，组织解体，武器损害，影响支前参战及社会治安任务的完成。
    三、人民武装组成问题
    人民武装同样是为着进行无产阶级领导的、以工农为基础的反帝反封建的新民主主义革命，其组织成份，自然应该适合这个总任务。所以毛主席指出：“除老幼病患者外，一切男女公民均应组织在自卫军中，从自卫军中挑选精悍分子组织民兵或基干军。”根据这原则，人民武装之组织成员应是：自卫队：凡十八岁至五十五岁及五十五岁以上之体力较强的公民，无病患残疾者，不分阶级、种族，均应编制为自卫队。为了便于支援前线，应科学的有计划的在一个行政村内组成担架队、运输队等，又以区为单位组成若干梯队，以便轮流支前。民兵：凡年在十八岁至三十五岁的无病患男子，除破坏分子（包括曾在敌人阵营中当特务或当排以上干部等），反动恶霸的地富流氓分子外，都可动员其在自愿原则下，经农会审查，上级批准，参加民兵。民兵数量，一般应至少发展到该地人口的百分之五。妇女民兵则不再发展，已有的逐渐取消。
    这样做，一部分地富分子，可能参加民兵，这并不可怕；但必须注意：领导的骨干分子必须是政治上可靠的，以保证党的绝对领导，武器掌握在可靠分子手里。有的地区“民兵中要评成份”，民兵中地富分子全部清洗，“民兵中排斥与清洗中农成份”、“误斗中农不恢复民兵资格”等，都是左倾关门主义的错误观点与做法。但有些武装组织中忽视党的绝对领导，违反以工农为基础为骨干的原则，武器没确实掌握在可靠分子手中等，也是错误的。另外，有些干部主张取消人民武装，这是自己解除武装的极危险的麻痹思想。由于麻痹，使特务流氓反动分子混入组织，发生叛变、偷盗、抢劫、破坏等严重事件，这些血的教训应引起警惕，迅速克服。
    四、和中心工作结合问题
    人民武装干部除留一定人员坚持工作及参战外，其余干部统一由组织分配，在各基点各配备武装干部，以便照顾日常工作（如支前、维持治安等）。
