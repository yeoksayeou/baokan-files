Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 24th: The Kuomintang reactionary government's conspiracy to have the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union "mediate" the Chinese civil war has gone bankrupt. After the Soviet government formally replied to the Kuomintang government on the 17th of this month, sternly rejecting the Kuomintang government's request and publicly announcing it, the Kuomintang government spokesperson admitted on the 20th that the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have all refused to "mediate" the Chinese civil war.
