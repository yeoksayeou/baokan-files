 The middle schools in the North China Liberated Area have trained 36,168 educated youths in the past three years, sending them to work or pursue further studies in various people's undertakings. They have a wide range of employment, including civil affairs, finance and economics, culture and education, industry, transportation, post and telecommunications, and other sectors. They have no concerns about unemployment because the New Democratic society has arranged good employment prospects for them.

　　In the New Democratic liberated areas, students generally do not have to pay tuition and miscellaneous fees, and the People's Government also provides a large amount of public funds to assist young people who cannot afford to study, solving their living difficulties such as food and clothing. Taking the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region as an example: among the 6,839 students in middle schools throughout the region, the number of publicly funded students reached 3,347, accounting for almost 50 percent. This ensures that the children of the working people have the opportunity to study. In their studies and lives, student democracy, free thought, the cultivation of young people's democratic style, and a realistic and truth-seeking scientific attitude are promoted, and students are encouraged to participate in extracurricular social activities, so that they become new-type intellectuals who are loyal to serving the people. In primary schools, the system of corporal punishment for children is generally abolished, and teachers are encouraged to lead by example and influence children through demonstration. The management of children mainly focuses on guiding children to establish self-governing lives. School rules are discussed democratically by children, inspiring children to consciously abide by them, and educating children to develop collectivist living habits, so that they become healthy citizens of the New Democratic society.

　　In terms of social education, it is mainly reflected in the winter schools held in various places. In 1946, the Taihang area had 15,000 winter schools, enrolling 1.65 million illiterate people. In 15 counties including Wutai in Beiyue, there were 3,603 winter schools in 3,351 administrative villages, exceeding the number of one school per village. Wuxun County in Jinnan organized more than 3,000 mobile winter schools with stretcher teams and transportation teams during busy war service, carrying out cultural education work among the masses participating in war service. Another important form of cultural education for the masses is the blackboard newspaper. In the North China Liberated Area, every village has a blackboard newspaper. Because of its simple language and close connection with the lives of the masses, it is generally loved by the masses. Through blackboard newspapers, news of current affairs and military victories is spread in the vast countryside, the masses are organized to produce, and health knowledge is promoted. At the same time, the cultural level of the masses is improved by organizing them to write articles for blackboard newspapers. With the victory of the People's Liberation War, many cities have been liberated one after another. In the cities, the work of mass education centers has been carried out. Through the mass education centers, various cultural activities are organized in the cities, and cultural and political education is carried out for urban workers and ordinary citizens. Due to the development of mass cultural education, and the development of production and land reform have improved the people's lives, the cultural and entertainment activities of the masses have been greatly enlivened, and the liberated peasants have generally participated in cultural and entertainment activities. According to statistics from 22 counties in the Taiyue area in 1946, there were 700 rural opera troupes with 12,400 actors, and 2,200 Yangko teams. In the People's Liberation War, the masses compiled and performed many stories of military service, war participation, and combat heroes, inspiring the masses' confidence in victory and enthusiasm for supporting the front. In addition, great achievements have been made in the transformation of old operas, folk artists, and various folk arts in the past few years, which is of great significance to promoting social education in North China.

　　政府设大量免费学额毕业学生无失业顾虑
    三年来，华北解放区的中等学校培养了三万六千一百六十八名知识青年，输送到各个人民事业部门工作或升学深造。他们就业的范围是很广泛的，包括民政、财经、文教、工业、交通、邮电等各个事业部门；他们没有任何失业的顾虑，因为新民主主义的社会给他们安排了良好的就业前途。
    在新民主主义的解放区，学生入学普遍地免缴学费和杂费，同时人民政府并支付大批公费资助无力就学的青年解决衣食等生活困难。仅以原晋冀鲁豫边区统计：全边区中等学校学生六千八百卅九人中，公费生名额即达三千三百四十七名，差不多占百分之五十。因此保证劳动人民的子弟有就学的机会。在学习生活上，提倡学生民主讨论、自由思想、培养青年的民主作风以及实事求是、追求真理的科学态度，并鼓励学生参加课外的社会活动，使他们成为忠诚为人民服务的新型知识分子。在小学校里普遍废除对儿童的体罚制度，提倡教师以身作则，以示范作用影响儿童。对儿童的管理主要在辅导儿童建立自治生活。学校的规则经过儿童的民主讨论，启发儿童自觉的遵守，教育儿童养成集体主义的生活习惯，使成为新民主主义社会的健全的公民。
    在社会教育方面，主要表现在各地所举办的冬学上。太行区在一九四六年有冬学一万五千个，入学文盲一百六十五万人。北岳五台等十五个县三千三百五十一个行政村，冬学数为三千六百零三个，超过了每村一校的数目。冀南武训县曾在战勤繁忙的时候，随着担架队运输队组织起三千多人的流动大冬学，在参加战勤的群众中进行文化教育工作。对群众进行文化教育的另一种重要形式就是黑板报。在华北解放区，村村都有黑板报。由于它的文字通俗以及和群众生活的密切联系，普遍为群众所喜爱。通过黑板报，在广大农村中传播时事及军事胜利的消息，组织群众生产，以及宣传卫生知识等，同时以组织群众为黑板报写稿的方法，提高群众的文化。随着人民解放战争的胜利，许多城市相继解放，在城市中，开展了民众教育馆的工作，通过民众教育馆，在城市中组织各种文化活动，进行城市工人及一般市民的文化及政治教育工作。由于群众文化教育的发展，以及发展生产、土地改革使人民的生活获得了改善，使群众的文化娱乐活动大为活跃，翻身农民普遍参加文化娱乐活动。据太岳区一九四六年二十二个县的统计：农村剧团有七百个，演员一万二千四百人，并有秧歌队二千二百个。在人民解放战争中，群众编演了许多参军参战与战斗英雄的故事，鼓舞群众的胜利信心与支援前线的热情。此外，在对旧剧、民间艺人以及各种民间艺术的改造方面，数年来，亦获很大成绩，对推进华北社会教育有极大的意义。
