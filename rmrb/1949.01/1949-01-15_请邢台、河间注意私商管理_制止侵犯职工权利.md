[Taixing Telegraph] The Xingtai City Qianjin (Forward) newspaper revealed that private tobacco shops in the city, such as Jiuxingwu, Shanxingcheng (Sanxingcheng), and Jicheng, have violated the government's policy of benefiting both labor and capital, restored unreasonable old systems, and engaged in illegal acts such as unjustified dismissals, infringing upon the legitimate interests of workers. The government has clearly stipulated that workers should have the freedom to engage in activities outside of normal working hours, but Jiuxingwu Tobacco Shop's self-imposed "Ten Rules" included a third rule stating that "all personnel are not allowed to go out for leisure; if there is business, they must notify the foreman and manager for permission." The seventh rule stipulated that "workers must have their belongings inspected by the sales department when returning home," which is a very insulting act to workers. The tenth rule stipulated that "all personnel must abide by the rules and regulations and be subject to the command of the manager and foreman; those who violate the rules will be immediately dismissed from the shop." This meant that if the manager had additional demands, the employer could use this general provision to force workers to obey. The fifth rule stipulated that "the revenue from manure and tobacco residue in the shop belongs to all personnel, regardless of size, each receiving an equal share." According to past customs in Xingtai, manure and tobacco residue belonged to the workers, and other personnel could not share in it. Here, the shop manager did not emphasize the old system and old habits. Since the rules and regulations were unreasonable, requiring workers to be "immediately dismissed from the shop for violations" was illegal. In addition, the tobacco shop also had the bad habit of "if the manager does not eat dinner, the workers cannot eat on time, and if the manager does not sleep, the workers cannot go to sleep," as well as excessive exploitation with working hours sometimes reaching fifteen hours. The shop also used the excuse of free wages to secretly bribe individual backward workers with stock options or money, ostensibly paying them less wages, in order to achieve their conspiracy to depress workers' wages. The shop manager also threatened workers with "if you don't earn enough money, you can quit," and four or five workers have already quit. In addition, the Jicheng and Shanxingcheng tobacco shops adopted illegal acts of retaliating against workers and unjustified dismissals after refunds and subsidies. For example, the worker Dong Cheng even made a guarantee to the employer when signing the wage contract, promising to "implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and work hard," but in the end, the employer still unjustifiably dismissed Dong. The Shanxingcheng tobacco shop also arbitrarily dismissed four or five workers. Although the above matters have been stopped by the municipal government, they have not been properly resolved and need to be corrected urgently. (Editor's Note: Rule 3 of the Xingtai Jiuxingwu Tobacco Shop's regulations: "All personnel are not allowed to go out for leisure..." Workers in general capitalist countries can still move freely outside of working hours. In the old society, this was only the case for apprentices, and generally not for skilled workers. This regulation has already restricted workers' freedom of action. Rule 10: "Workers must have their belongings inspected when returning home..." This is actually a search and is simply an insult to workers' personality, treating workers like slaves. The provisions of Rule 5 regarding the handling of manure and tobacco residue in the shop fully illustrate that they are engaging in retaliatory further exploitation and oppression of workers. Even the old system of the past was not like this. According to the regulations on factory or shop rules, they must be effective after being agreed upon by both the factory and the workers under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital. Not only workers should abide by the rules, but foremen and managers should also abide by them. However, rules such as those unilaterally made by Jiuxingwu for the benefit of the shop owner are like a chain for the workers, and the workers are only forced to accept them. This is only harmful and not beneficial to the development of production.)

　　请邢台、河间注意私商管理
  　制止侵犯职工权利
    【太行电】邢台市前进报揭露该市私营烟店久兴武、善兴成（三兴成）、积成等违反政府劳资两利政策，恢复不合理的旧制度，无理解雇等侵犯工人正当利益的非法行为。政府已经明文规定过工人在正当的工作时间以外应有活动的自由，但久兴武烟店在其私自规定的十大号规中，第三条是“全体人员不许出外游逛，有事须通知工头经理许可”；第七条规定“工人回家携带物品，须经门市部检验”，这是十分侮辱工人的行为；第十条规定：“全体人员须遵守号规，受经理工头指挥，违犯规则立即出号”，这就是说，经理如有额外要求，资方就可以以这笼统的规定强迫工人服从。第五条规定：“本号粪土、烟末售价归全体人员，无论大小各一份”；按邢市过去习惯，粪土、烟末是属于工人的，其他人员不能分。在这里，该号经理就不强调旧制度旧习惯了。号规既不合理，要工人“违者立即出号”，这是违法的。此外，该烟店还有“晚上经理不吃饭，工人也不能按时吃饭，经理不睡觉，工人也不能去睡觉”的恶习，及有时工作时间竟达十五小时的过分剥削。该烟店更借口自由工资，暗中以顶股或给钱收买个别落后工人，表面上少给一些工资，借此来达到其压低工人工资的阴谋。该店经理并以“你赚钱少可以不干”来威胁工人，现出号的工人已有四五个。此外，积成与善兴成两烟店在退补以后采取了报复工人、无理解雇的违法行为。如工人董成竟在订工资合同时，即向资方提出“执行劳资两利政策、好好干”的保证，但结果资方还是把董无理解雇了。善兴成烟店也随便解雇了四五个工人。以上几件事，虽经市府制止，但仍未得到适当解决，急应纠正。（编者按：邢台久兴武烟店号规第三条：“全体人员不许出外游逛……”在一般资本主义国家的工人在工作时间之外还可以自由活动。过去旧社会只是对学徒如此，对一般学成的工人，一般还不这样限制。这种规定已经限制了工人行动上的自由。第十条：“工人回家携带物品需经检验……”这实际是一种搜查，简直是对工人人格上的污辱，把工人当成奴隶。第五条对店中粪土、烟末处理之规定则完全说明了他们对工人是一种报复性的进一步剥削与压迫。因为过去的旧制度也不是这样。按对于厂规或号规之规定，必需是在劳资两利的原则下，经过厂方与工人双方同意始为有效。号规不单工人遵守，工头和经理同样应该遵守。而象久兴武这样单方面为店主利益而订的号规，对工人等于一条锁链，工人只是被迫接受。这对发展生产只是有害而无益。）
