　　Strengthening Scientific Research and Improving Engineering Construction
  　East China Research Institute Resumes Work
    【Xinhua News Agency, East China, 5th】 The "East China Research Institute," a scientific research organization in East China, is currently actively preparing to resume operations. The institute is divided into seven groups and two offices, namely, Water Conservancy, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Agriculture and Forestry, Mining and Metallurgy, and Textile Dyeing, as well as a Data and Compilation Office. During the preparatory period, the institute has already begun research work. Those participating in practical research include scientific and technical experts Kong Peiqing, Ding Jishi, Kong Yaoqing, Xu Shigao, Zhang Hongying, Zhao Shufu, He Dexing, Zhao Yinchuan, Wang Baoxian, Yan Kelie, Tian Weizhong, Huang Zuozhou, Gao Shiyuan, Gu Zhicheng and others, totaling forty-four people, including thirty-three full-time researchers and eleven part-time researchers. Since joining the research institute, the researchers in each group have formulated research plans to solve the current pressing needs of the people and to plan various engineering construction and improvement projects that are currently feasible. For example, the Chemical Engineering Group has sent specialists to Haizhou, Rizhao and other places to collect raw materials such as phosphate rock and manure to study substitutes for sulfurized phosphorus for the needs of the match industry; at the same time, research on by-products of coking coal is being carried out. The Agriculture and Forestry Group has begun to select wheat varieties, improve seeds, and promote superior varieties. For example, the No. 195 wheat promoted by the group has white color, thin skin, hard stalks, strong resistance, can resist black穗病 (loose smut), and can produce 10% to 30% more wheat than ordinary wheat. Plans for increasing cotton production are also being drafted. The Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Group is designing improvements to water pumps and textile machines, and is trial-producing machines for making cloth shoes. The Water Conservancy Group plans to promote well-digging and water conservancy projects that may be carried out in Shandong. The Textile Dyeing Group is preparing to promote rural weaving. The Mining and Metallurgy Group focuses on research on the recovery and increased production of coal mines. The Civil Engineering Group is currently designing the construction of streets and houses in the new Jinan City. The Compilation and Data Office has begun to translate, collect, and organize scientific literature and data related to Shandong's industry. In order to unite and organize more scientific and technical personnel to participate in research work, the institute is now dividing researchers into four levels: Researchers, Associate Researchers, Assistant Researchers, and Trainee Researchers, according to their academic qualifications, technology, and work experience. The institute is currently working on one hand and continuing to prepare on the other, enriching the staff and equipment of each group and office, and will announce its official establishment as soon as the preparations are completed.

　　加强科学研究改进工程建设
  　华东研究院恢复工作
    【新华社华东五日电】华东科学研究机关“华东研究院”，现正积极筹备恢复中。该院共分七组二室，即水利、土木、化工、机电、农林、矿冶、染织等七组和资料、编译两室。在筹备期中该院即已开始进行研究工作，参加实际研究的，有科学技术专家孔佩卿、丁基实、孔耀卿、徐士高、张洪瀛、赵书郛、何德行、赵印川、王葆先、阎克烈、田维中、黄作舟、高世元、顾之澄等四十四人，其中专任研究员三十三人，兼任研究员十一人。各组研究员自参加研究院后，即分组拟订研究计划，以解决目前人民迫切需要的以及筹划目前可能进行的各种工程建设与改良工作。如化工组已派专人赴海州、日照等地采集磷灰石、＠粪等原料，研究硫化磷代用品，以供火柴业的需用；同时进行焦煤副产品的研究等。农林组已开始进行麦子选种、改良种子及优良品种的推广工作。如该组推广的一九五号小麦，色白皮薄，杆硬，抵抗力强，能抗黑穗病，且比普通小麦能多产麦子百分之十到三十。棉花的增产计划亦在拟订中。机电组正设计抽水机与纺织机的改良，并试制做布鞋的机器。水利组计划推广凿井及在山东可能进行的水利工程。染织组准备推广农村的织布工作。矿冶组着重研究煤矿的恢复与增产计划。土木组目前正设计新济南市街道、房屋的建设。编译与资料室已着手翻译、搜集及整理有关山东工业的科学文献资料。该院为团结组织更多的科学技术人员，参加研究工作，现按照各研究员的学历、技术、工作经验等不同，分为研究员、副研究员、助理研究员、学习研究员等四级。该院现正一面开始工作；一面继续筹备，充实各组室的人员和器材、书籍设备，一俟筹备就绪，即宣布正式成立。
