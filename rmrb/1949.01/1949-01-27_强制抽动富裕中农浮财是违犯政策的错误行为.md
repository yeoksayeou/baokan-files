　　Forcibly Seizing Floating Wealth from Prosperous Middle Peasants is an Erroneous Act Violating Policy
　　Editor:
　　1. Should we seize floating wealth from prosperous middle peasants? If not, please quickly notify the First District of Ji County, Ji'nan District, as they have already sealed up the cabinets of prosperous middle peasants.
　　2. How should we seize land from prosperous middle peasants? Should it be seized in the same way as from rich peasants? If it is the same, why are they called prosperous middle peasants?

　　Answer: Comrade Ren Bishi, in the section on "Several Issues in Land Reform" concerning the need to firmly unite with all middle peasants, stated: "In the equal distribution of land, the land of middle peasants is mostly neither distributed in nor out. Only a small number of prosperous middle peasants may have to give up some land (but none of their floating wealth can be touched at all)... However, when implementing the equal distribution of land, it is necessary to consult with the middle peasants and obtain their consent. If they themselves express opposition to moving a part of the prosperous middle peasants' land, then we should concede to them and not move their land." This is very clear: the floating wealth of prosperous middle peasants must not be touched at all during land reform; when it is necessary to move their land, their consent must be obtained, and if they do not agree, do not move it. In other words, the method must be strictly separated from the confiscation of rich peasant land or the confiscation of landlord land. This is a policy boundary and should not be ambiguous in the slightest. If in the First District of Ji County, Ji'nan, errors violating policy, such as moving the floating wealth of middle peasants or moving land without the consent of the middle peasants, have indeed occurred during land reform, the Ji County Party Committee should immediately investigate and correct this deviation, return the floating wealth taken from the middle peasants as soon as possible, and also explain patiently before seizing land, and concede to the middle peasants when necessary. At the same time, cadres should be taught to correctly understand and grasp the specific policies for uniting with the middle peasants.

专栏：询问与答复

　　强制抽动富裕中农浮财是违犯政策的错误行为编辑同志：
    一、富裕中农是否抽浮财？如不应该抽，请你们赶快通知冀南区冀县第一区，他们已将富裕中农的柜子给封上了。
    二、富裕中农抽他的地时应该怎样抽呢？是否和富农一样的抽法？假使一样的话为什么又叫作富裕中农呢？
　　华大政院民夫
    答：任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”中应该坚固的团结全体中农一节中讲道：“在平分土地中，中农的地绝大部分是不分进也不分出，只有少数富裕中农可能要拿出一点土地（其浮财则一点也不能动），……但在实行平分土地时，必须和中农商量取得其同意，如果在动富裕中农的一部分土地，而他们自己表示反对时，那就应当向他们让步，不动他们的土地。”这里说得十分清楚：土改中富裕中农的浮财一点也不能抽动；在须要抽动他们的土地时，也必须商得他们的同意，他们不同意就不要动。也就是在方式上必须和征收富农土地或没收地主土地严格分开，这是政策界限，丝毫不应含混，冀南冀县一区在土改中，若确已发生动中农浮财，或不经中农同意而抽动土地的违犯政策的错误行为，应请冀县县委立即调查并纠正这一偏向，拿中农的浮财应赶快退还，抽土地也要经过耐心说明，必要时应向中农让步，同时并教干部正确认识并掌握团结中农的各项具体政策。
