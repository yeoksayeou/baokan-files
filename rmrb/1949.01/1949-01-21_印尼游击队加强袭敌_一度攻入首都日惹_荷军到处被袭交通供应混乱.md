Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Reports from various sources indicate that Indonesian guerrillas are intensifying their attacks on Dutch occupation forces in Java. On the night of the 9th, guerrillas launched a major attack on the occupied Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, engaging Dutch troops in fierce street fighting on the city's main streets. The guerrillas, armed with mortars and explosive charges, destroyed Dutch military buildings and withdrew safely after completing their mission. Prior to this attack, Malang, a key strategic stronghold of the Dutch forces in East Java, had been subjected to a series of fierce attacks by guerrillas, resulting in 68 Dutch casualties. Solo, the second largest city in Central Java, also suffered a serious attack. Guerrillas systematically sabotaged major railways and highways, and burned Dutch food stores, repeatedly disrupting transportation in Java and causing supply disruptions. The amount of food the Dutch authorities in Yogyakarta were able to transport was only a quarter of what was actually needed (Associated Press). Guerrilla warfare is also expanding on the island of Sumatra, with guerrillas recapturing the city of Pakanbaru in central Sumatra on the 12th. The Dutch occupation authorities in Jambi, a well-known oil field area, admitted that the area's oil field facilities had been "burned by Communist forces," and the Jambi power plant and many other important buildings had also been destroyed.

Following the announcement of a hypocritical "ceasefire" in Java on January 2, the Dutch reactionaries announced a "ceasefire" in Sumatra on the 5th. However, they will continue to "suppress" those who "disrupt public order" (i.e., Indonesian resistance fighters). Dutch reinforcements are also steadily arriving in Indonesia from the Netherlands (TASS). According to Indonesian clandestine radio, Dutch troops are massacring resisting Indonesians in the occupied cities of Yogyakarta, Madiun, and Medan, causing even greater resentment among the Indonesian people towards the occupiers. During this Dutch invasion, the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Republic's territory were also severely damaged, with tens of thousands of overseas Chinese displaced in Java and Sumatra. Dutch Prime Minister Drees arrived in Java on the 5th to organize the Indonesian puppet "Federation" and the so-called "Federal Army"; he will also hold negotiations with the captured Sukarno, Hatta, and others. An Associated Press dispatch on the 4th quoted a U.S. diplomatic official as saying that Drees would "extend the hand of Dutch friendship to Hatta, Sukarno, and other moderate elements in the Indonesian Republic." Three days after Drees arrived in Java, the Dutch authorities released a shameless letter of surrender signed by key members of the Indonesian traitor government headed by Sukarno. The letter "expressed gratitude for the Dutch treatment," and Sukarno said: "I do not hate the Dutch."

　　印尼游击队加强袭敌
  　一度攻入首都日惹
  　荷军到处被袭交通供应混乱
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：印尼游击队对爪哇荷兰占领军的袭击日益增强。九日夜间，游击队大举袭击被侵占的印尼首府日惹，在市内的大马路上与荷军展开激烈巷战。游击队携带迫击炮与爆破火药，毁坏了荷方军事建筑，于任务完成后安然退去。在此次袭击以前，东爪哇荷军的重要战略据点玛琅，曾受到游击队的数路猛袭，荷军死伤六十八名。中爪哇第二大城梭罗，亦受过严重袭击。游击队有计划地破坏主要铁路与公路线，焚毁荷方储藏之粮食，使爪哇荷方的交通屡陷停顿，供应陷于混乱状态。日惹方面荷军当局所能运到的粮食，仅及实需数量的四分之一（合众社）。苏门答腊岛的游击战亦在扩大中，游击队于十二日收复苏岛中部的帕康巴和城。著名油田区占碑的荷占领当局承认，该区油田设备已被“共产党队伍所焚毁”，占碑的电力厂及许多其他重要建筑亦被毁。
    荷兰反动派，继一月二日宣布虚伪的爪哇“停战”后，复于五日宣布在苏门答腊“停战”。但对所谓“扰乱治安分子”（即指印尼抗战分子），则将继续“剿灭”。荷援军也正源源自荷兰开赴印尼增援（塔斯社）。据印尼秘密电台宣称：荷军在被侵占的日惹、茉莉芬、棉兰等城大肆屠杀反抗的印尼人民，引起印尼人民对占领者的更大激愤。在此次荷军的侵略行动中，共和国区内华侨的生命财产亦遭到惨重摧残，爪哇、苏岛两地流离失所的侨胞达数万名。荷总理德里斯已于五日抵爪哇，着手组织印尼傀儡“联邦”及所谓“联邦军”；并将与被俘的苏加诺、哈达等进行谈判。合众社四日电曾引美外交官员的话说：德里斯将“向哈达、苏加诺及印尼共和国其他温和派人士伸出荷兰友谊之手”。德里斯抵爪哇三天后，荷当局发表了以苏加诺为首的印尼叛卖政府首要阁员签名的无耻投降函件，该函件“对荷兰的待遇表示感谢”，苏加诺则称：“我不仇恨荷兰。”
