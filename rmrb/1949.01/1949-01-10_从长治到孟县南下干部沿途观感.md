　　From Changzhi to Meng County
  　Observations of Southern Cadres Along the Way
　　From Handan to Changzhi, and now from Changzhi to Meng County.

　　Passing through Gaoping, the Licuan and Lanchezhen areas of Jincheng, I saw many mines and iron vehicles of various sizes transporting coal, which proves that the area is rich in coal and iron reserves. According to the masses, mining coal and iron, smelting pig iron, and transporting to and fro are the main sources of their livelihood. However, most mines use indigenous methods of mining, and there are very few public ones, and there is no large-scale mining equipment. It is said that this area was greatly devastated during the Japanese and Kuomintang occupation, and many workers fled due to lack of livelihood. The fact that the escaped workers have not all returned has hindered the development of the mining industry to some extent.

　　In Jincheng ××, I saw a public coal mine factory. The factory has a water pump and 130 workers, but only 80 workers regularly go down the well. They are divided into day and night shifts and can produce 300 baskets of coal per day. Each basket weighs 500 kilograms, for a total of 150,000 kilograms, averaging over 1,100 kilograms per person per day. Workers' wages are roughly divided into three grades: the first grade gets 16 jin (one dou) of millet per day, the second grade gets 8 or 9 jin per day, and the third grade gets 4 or 5 jin per day. Because the operating conditions of nearby factories vary, the wage grades also vary.

　　Arriving in Licuan (under the jurisdiction of Jincheng County), I visited a private coal kiln. This kiln is composed of seven workers, and the tools are all old. Only small carts, one foot wide and one and a half feet long, are used to transport coal. They can produce 3,000 kilograms per day, averaging more than 400 kilograms per person. Each kilogram is worth 10 or 20 Jiao tickets, and the best is 40 Jiao tickets. Each person earns 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, up to more than 10,000 yuan per day. Because coal is cheap and transportation costs are high, their general living standards are not high, but they are still much better than three years ago.

　　There are many coal mines here that are jointly operated by several people. The well depth varies from three to fifteen zhang, and the water is mostly drained upwards with a windlass. Due to crude tools and techniques, the output is also low.

　　The Taiyue × Sub-district Iron Goods Company is located here and has eight pig iron smelting furnaces and more than 200 workers in the entire factory. The business is developed; they mainly collect pig iron to smelt wrought iron. Currently, from the acquisition of various pig iron utensils (such as broken pots, broken shell casings, etc.), it has solved a major livelihood problem for 2,000 to 3,000 people. We feel that in the future, in addition to establishing public enterprises, the government must also pay more attention to this work of supporting and driving small producers.

　　Another suggestion: In the future, it is very necessary to vigorously exploit the mineral resources here in a planned and organized manner. On the one hand, strengthen the leadership of public enterprises, improve technology, and use machinery; on the other hand, support and drive private enterprises. However, judging from the current situation, the local leadership does not pay enough attention to this. When we asked several responsible comrades in Jincheng, they did not even know the approximate figures for coal and iron factories and mines. We feel that the leadership of the local Party and government should pay attention to the development of this cause.

　　There is a militia medical cooperative in Xijie, Meng County, which is not small in scale. According to local residents, it was organized by the militia from the surplus grain saved during duty and with the assistance of the government. There are four or five doctors, five or six nurses, and seven health workers in the cooperative. When the militia is on duty, they go with the militia; only one or two people are left at home. Usually, they serve the masses and relieve the militia and the masses of many difficulties, so the masses respond very well. We think that this kind of health organization that serves the masses should be appropriately and universally promoted.
　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
　　　　
　　From Changzhi to Gaoping and Jincheng, the counties pay more attention to the highways, especially in the Licuan and Changping areas, where mountains are cut and rocks are piled, which is a huge project, greatly facilitating north-south traffic and also facilitating the development of the coal and iron industry in this area. After leaving the mountains, especially in the Qinxian and Mengxian areas, the highways are not paid attention to. The highways are uneven, and the roads are full of mud and water. Qinyang Bridge is an important north-south transportation route in the area. Some of the wood is exposed, or wood is missing, and it has not been repaired. The marching soldiers and civilians are discussing it, and some say: "The county's construction is poor." Others say: "It should be repaired!" Therefore, it is recommended that the county repair it quickly.

　　In Changzhi, Gaoping, and Jincheng counties, especially in Licuan and Changping areas of Jincheng, very few women around 25 years old have unbound their feet, and many girls of 15 or 16 years old still have bound feet, and some little girls still have braids. On the one hand, this shows that women here are still severely subjected to feudal rule, and on the other hand, it also reflects that the local women's work is still very superficial, and it is possible that the county and district leadership has not done enough publicity and education on this point.
　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
　　　　
　　When you arrive in Qinxian and Mengxian, there are obviously fewer slogans with educational significance, and the walls of the villages are gray and tattered, which makes people feel incompatible with the atmosphere of our liberated areas.

　　In addition to the above, I also feel that two points are worth noting:

　　First, burning (making) manure with firewood, and there is firewood smoke everywhere. There is a lot of cheap coal here, so every family burns coal. The firewood in the fields is not used, so most of it is burned as fertilizer. When burning, cover it with soil and use smoke to fumigate it, which can replace pit soil. A villager said: "We have no use for firewood here. There is no place to put it at home, and it gets in the way of planting in the fields, so it is better to use firewood to make manure." This method of fumigation fertilizer is very good.

　　Second: The custom of funerals is too wasteful. When we arrived at Yangjiachuan, there was a family holding a funeral with gongs and drums. It is said that the general custom here is that middle peasants and above must make a big fuss for three days when holding funerals, and neighbors and friends must also eat and drink for three days; after a person dies, they are not buried first, but are piled up with brick tombs and left for three to seven or eight years, and then buried. When buried, they must blow drums, set off lights, and make a big fuss. This kind of extravagant and wasteful rural custom is not good. It is recommended that the local leadership widely and appropriately explain and persuade the masses to relieve their ideological and economic burdens.

### 从长治到孟县南下干部沿途观感

　　从长治到孟县
  　南下干部沿途观感
    从邯郸到长治，现在又从长治到孟县。
    路经高平、晋城的犁川、拦车镇一带，沿途看到许多矿井及来往运煤铁的大小车辆，证明该地煤铁蓄量甚富，据群众反映：挖煤铁，炼熟铁，来往运输，是他们生活来源的主要依靠。惟各矿多用土法开采，公营很少，大规模的开采设备是没有的。据说此地在日本和国民党占据时受摧残甚大，工人多因生活无着逃荒走了，现因外逃工人尚未全部回来，使矿业发展受到一些阻碍。
    在晋城××看到一个公营煤矿厂，该厂设有一抽水机，工人一百三十人；但经常下井的八十人。他们分昼夜两班，每天可出煤三百筐，每筐五百斤，合计十五万斤，平均每人每日出一千一百斤以上。工人工资大略分为三等，一等每天小米十六斤（一斗），二等每天八、九斤，三等每天四、五斤，因附近各厂经营情况不一，工资分等亦各不同。
    到了犁川（晋城县属）参观了一个私人煤窑，此窑是由七个工人组合成的，工具都是旧的，只有一尺宽一尺半长的小拖车运送煤，每日能出三千斤，每人平均四百多斤，每斤合冀钞十元或二十元，最好者四十元，每日每人得洋四千元至五千元，最多是一万余元。由于煤贱运费重，所以他们一般的生活不高，不过也比三年前强的多。
    这里有不少是由几个人合营的煤井，井深三丈至十五丈不等，多是用辘轳向上排水，因工具技术拙笨，出产量也低。
    太岳×分区铁货公司设在这里，有炼熟铁炉八个，全厂工人二百多名，业务发达；他们主要是收生铁炼熟铁。现从收购各种生铁器（如破锅、烂炮弹皮等）中，已使群众二、三千人解决了很大生活问题。我们感觉，今后公家除建立公营企业外，尚须加强注意这种扶植带动小生产者的工作。
    另外一个意见：此地矿产今后很有必要去有计划有组织的下大力开采，一方面对公营的加强领导，改良技术，使用机器；一方面扶植与带动起私营的。但目前看情形当地领导方面重视是不够的。我们问到晋城某几个负责同志时，连煤铁工厂矿井等大概数字亦不知，我们觉得应提起此地党政府领导方面注意这一事业的发展。
    　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
　　　　
    孟县西街有一民兵医药社，规模还不小，据当地居民谈，是由民兵出勤时所节余下的粮食加上公家的扶助而组织起来的，社内有医生四、五人，护士五、六人，卫生员七人，民兵出勤时即跟民兵去出发；家中只留一二人；平时为群众服务，给民兵和群众解除很多困苦，因此群众反映很好。我们想，这种为群众服务的卫生组织，应适当的普遍提倡。
    　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
　　　　
    从长治到高平、晋城下山，各地对公路亦较注意，特别是犁川、昌平一带，凿山垒石，工程浩大，大大便利了南北交通，同时也便利了此地煤铁业的发展。出山后，特别是沁县、孟县一带，对公路便不注意了，公路高低不平，泥水满道。沁阳桥是该地南北交通要道，有的露出木头，或缺木头，未加修理，行路军民议论纷纷，有的说：“县里建设性差。”有的说：“可该修修了！”因此，建议该县应迅速予以修理。
    　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
　　　　
    长治、高平、晋城三县，特别是晋城之犁川及昌平一带，妇女二十五岁上下的，只有很少的放了足，十五六的女孩不少的还缠足，还有些小女孩留着发辫。这一方面说明这里妇女受封建统治仍很严重，同时亦反映着当地妇女工作还很不深入，可能县区在领导上对这点宣传教育是不够的。
    　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
　　　　
    到沁县和孟县境，各种有教育意义的标语很显然的少了，各村墙壁上灰踏踏的，使人颇感不合我解放区的气息。
    除上所述，还感到两点值得注意：
    第一、用柴烧（造）粪，看到遍地是柴烟。这里煤多价贱，所以家家烧煤。地里柴用不着，大多烧掉当肥料用，烧时盖土用烟薰，可顶坑土。）一个老乡说：“咱这里柴没用，放到家里没地方，放到地里又碍种地，不如拿柴弄粪好。”这种薰肥办法却是很好。
    第二：丧事的习惯太浪费。当我们到杨家川时，正锣鼓宣天，有人家办丧事。据说这里一般习俗，中农以上办丧事都得大闹三天，邻舍亲友也要大吃三天；人死先不埋，用砖墓垒起来，放三年到七八年，然后再埋，埋时还得吹鼓，放灯火，大闹一番。这种铺张浪费的乡间习俗，是不好的，建议当地领导上应广泛向群众适当的解释说服，解除群众思想上、经济上的负担。
