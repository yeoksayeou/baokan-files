　　Yangquan Fire Brick Workers Improve Tools
  　Fire Brick Production Doubles
    [Yangquan News] The refractory brick group of the Ceramics Department of ×× Factory was required to complete ×××× bricks of No. 15 brick and ×××× bricks of No. 16 brick in December. When they first accepted this task, they used the old method: two people shared a set of molds, and only produced about 35 No. 15 bricks a day. Eight sets of molds only produced 280 to 290 bricks a day in total. Everyone anxiously said, "Even if we just made No. 15 bricks, we wouldn't be able to complete the task in two months!" In order to complete the task, the workers all automatically arrived early and left late, working desperately, which immediately doubled the output. But after calculating, it was still impossible to complete the task; moreover, it would be unbearable to work like this for a long time. But everyone was determined to complete the task, so they took the time to think of solutions. As a result, group leader Zhang Guangrui and other comrades came up with a method to improve the tools: remove the original bottom plate of the mold and add two small wooden boards, and at the same time change the soil shovel knife into a shovel. In this way, both the top and bottom surfaces can be tamped, and shoveling soil is also faster. One person can operate one set of molds, and one person can produce more than 80 pieces a day, which is easier than before, making it possible to complete the task ahead of schedule. Everyone was very happy and said, "Still, more people means more ideas."
    Before the tools were modified, Liu Quanmu, the director of this department, improved the method of processing raw materials: changing the original method of milling mud by horsepower to manual mixing, and reducing the amount of water in the raw materials, which also solved the difficulty of milling mud and freezing in winter. The bricks made were also finer, more regular, had no defective products, and could shorten the drying time and enter the kiln earlier.
    Due to the above two transformations and improvements, the production of No. 15 fire bricks has doubled in quantity and improved in quality.

　　阳泉火砖工人改良工具
  　火砖生产量增加两倍
    【阳泉讯】××厂陶瓷部耐火砖组，十二月份生产任务要求完成十五号砖×万×千块，十六号砖×万块。开始接受这个任务时，用老办法做：两个人共用一套模，一天只出十五号砖三十五块左右，八套模一天总共才出二百八十到二百九十。大家都着急的说：“光十五号砖两月也完成不了！”为了完成任务，工友们就都自动早到迟退，拼命地干，一下把产量提高了一倍。可是算一算，还是完成不了任务；而且这样干，时间长了受不了。但是大家决心一定要完成任务，于是大家就抽空想办法。结果，小组长张广瑞等同志想出了一个改良工具的办法：即将模子原有底板取去，另加两条小木板，同时把铲土的刀子改成铲子。这样上下两面都能砸，铲土也快了。一套模子一个人就能干，而且一人一天能出八十多块，比早先还省劲，使得任务能提早完成。大家都高兴得很，都说：“还是人多办法广”。
    在未改造工具之前，本部主任刘全木同志，改进了处理原料的方法：将原来用马力碾泥改用人力拌，再减少些料内水份，这样把冬季碾泥结冰的困难也解决了。做出来的砖还比先前的细密、规矩，没有废货，还能缩短干燥时间，早点进窑。
    由于上面这两种改造与改进，十五号火砖的生产，在数量上比先增加了两倍，在质量上也提高了一步。
