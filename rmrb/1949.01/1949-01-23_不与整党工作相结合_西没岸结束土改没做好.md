(Jilu Yu Electric Dispatch) The work team in Ximeian, Second District, Shanghe, realized from actual inspection work that it was wrong to conduct the conclusion of land reform in isolation without combining it with party rectification. They clarified that they should continue to implement the direction of party rectification in future work. The Ximeian Village work team previously thought that it was necessary to conclude land reform first before carrying out party rectification, believing that the two tasks could not be combined in any way. They said, "The instructions from above are wonderfully good, but it's impossible to do." They also felt that concluding land reform was an urgent task, the sooner the better; combining it with party rectification would delay it by at least five or six days, making it impossible to complete the task on schedule. Therefore, when entering the village to work, they were determined to finish land reform quickly. At that time, it was the wheat planting season, and the cadres were lying down and not working. The village chief and instructor were also in conflict. In order to unite the cadres to work under the party's policy line, it was originally necessary to carry out preliminary party rectification, unite activists and better elements to lead together, distinguish right from wrong, and improve the thinking of party members; however, the work team was afraid that the party members would lie down again, so they did not dare to speak out boldly, only "restored the emotions of the cadres," and promoted the victory at the front to the village cadres, trying to use a conciliatory approach to get the village cadres to work. Therefore, even when errors were discovered, they were not brought up directly. For example, during the distribution of fruits, instructor Zhai Xiangwen went to visit relatives without permission, delaying the meeting and causing dissatisfaction among the party members. The work team only said privately, "Let's talk about it during the formal party rectification later," and did not mention it to Zhai Xiangwen. The result of doing so was: first, the village cadres with errors were timid and dared not work, pushing them only made them move, fearing mistakes and trouble during party rectification. Village chief Han Xingkui said during the evaluation of the distribution of fruits, "This is neither good to go in nor good to retreat, evaluating that giving it to someone will dissatisfy them, nothing works, anyway, I'll end up in trouble." Carrying a burden in their minds, they often stared blankly at each other when encountering problems, afraid of offending anyone, and the work progressed very slowly. Secondly, not carrying out preliminary party rectification and not combining it with party rectification to conclude land reform work made the thinking within the party inconsistent, with some engaging in favoritism. For example, when classifying class status, two village cadres sheltered rich peasants, and three party members did not play a role, fearing trouble and not speaking out; during the distribution of fruits, factionalism occurred within the party, with each side favoring one side, embracing small groups, "a distant neighbor is not as good as a near neighbor, a near neighbor is not as good as a neighbor across the door," and conflicts arose between the east and west sides. However, after discovering the above deviations, the work team did not seize these problems and handle them in a timely manner in conjunction with party rectification. They believed that "party rectification is not a matter of one or two days," fearing that it would delay the supplementary allocation and affect production. Therefore, they did not correctly carry out ideological struggle against the main leaders who engaged in factional struggles, but only held a party member meeting for education in a forced situation, and passed it off conciliatorily. As a result, because of constant disputes, the time for supplementary allocation was prolonged. In making party issues public, because the leadership believed that it was necessary to wait until the party members had reflected well and admitted their mistakes to the masses before making the party public, the relationship between the party and the masses could not be smoothed out early. Due to the above shortcomings, the party rectification and the rectification of the mass ranks could not achieve good results, and the awareness of party members could not be improved in practical work. Therefore, after the village work team recently conducted an inspection based on the instructions of the district party committee, they believed that the reason why this conclusion of land reform was not done well was that it was separated from party rectification. Therefore, they unanimously believe that at present, while leading production, democratic elections, land measurement, the issuance of land certificates, and the evaluation of yields, they should continue to implement party rectification to improve the awareness of party members.

### 不与整党工作相结合　西没岸结束土改没做好

　　不与整党工作相结合
  　西没岸结束土改没做好
    【冀鲁豫电】尚和二区西没岸工作组从实际检查工作中，体会到不结合整党、孤立进行结束土改的错误，明确了在今后工作中应继续贯彻整党的方向。西没岸村工作组以前的想法是：必须先进行了结束土改，以后才能整党，认为两个工作怎样也结合不起来。说：“上级指示的怪好，就是做不到。”又觉得结束土改是个紧急工作，越快越好；要结合整党，至少要耽误五六天，就不能按期完成任务了。因此进村工作时，就一心要赶快结束土改。当时正是种麦时期，干部又躺倒不干，村长与指导员还闹矛盾。为了使干部团结在党的政策路线之下进行工作，本来应该进行初步整党，团结积极分子与较好分子共同领导，分清是非，提高党员思想；但工作组却怕党员再躺倒，不敢大胆说明，只来了个“恢复恢复干部情绪”，向村干宣传宣传前方胜利，想用迁就的办法，使村干干起来。因此，发现错误也不正面提出。如在分果实时，指导员翟相文私自去看亲戚，耽误开会，引起党员不满，工作组只暗地里说：“等以后正式整党时再说吧”，没有向翟相文提出来。这样做的结果：首先使有错误的村干胆小不敢干，推一推动一动，怕出错，怕整党时闹麻烦。村长韩兴奎在评议分果实时说：“这弄的进也不是，退也不是，评议不给谁谁不满意，怎样也不行，反正咱得落不好”。思想上背着包袱作工作，遇事往往大眼瞪小眼，谁也怕得罪人，工作进行得很慢。其次，不经过初步整党，不结合整党去进行结束土改工作，使党内思想不统一，有的徇私情。如在划阶级时，就有两个村干包庇富农，有三个党员没起作用，怕落不好，不发言；在分配果实时，党内就发生了宗派，各偏袒一面，抱小团体，“远邻不如近邻，近邻不如对门”，东西两头闹起意见来。但在发现了以上的种种偏向之后，工作组并没有抓紧这些问题，及时地结合整党进行处理，他们认为“整党不是一天两天的事。”怕迟延了抽补，影响生产。因此，对闹宗派斗争的主要负责人没有正确地开展思想斗争，只是在被迫情况下，开个党员会进行一下教育，迁迁就就的就过去了。结果因为不断地闹纠纷，反而拖长了抽补的时间。在公开党的问题上，也因为领导上认为必须等党员反省好了，向群众承认了错误，才能公开党，所以党群关系也未能及早地弄通。由于以上毛病，使整党和整顿群众队伍不能收到很好的效果，使党员的觉悟不能在实际工作中得到提高，因此该村工作组最近根据区党委指示作了检查后，认为这次结束土改没有做好的原因，就是脱离了整党，所以一致认为目前应该是在领导生产，民主选举，丈量土地，发土地证与评产量等工作中，一面工作，一面继续贯彻整党，提高党员的觉悟。
