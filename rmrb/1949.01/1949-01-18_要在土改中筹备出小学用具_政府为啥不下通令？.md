To Prepare Elementary School Supplies During Land Reform
	Why Doesn't the Government Issue a Circular?

To the Editor:
	When elementary schools lack supplies, they are supposed to be prepared during land reform. But it is very difficult for teachers to persuade and mobilize without a government circular. Villages with relatively advanced politics are somewhat concerned about school supplies, but "stubborn villages" with backward politics cannot be reasoned with at all. In the farmers' association, the teachers' persuasion and mobilization are completely ineffective. What should be done about this? Since the government has stated that preparations should be made in the farmers' association, why not issue a circular? I hope the editor can explain the meaning of this.

		Zhang Tingxue, Elementary School Teacher, Qianqilitun, Ninth District, Xiajin

Comrade Zhang Tingxue:
	The fruits of the farmers' struggle in the land reform belong to the farmers themselves; they are what the landlords exploited and what they are now reclaiming. The disposal of these items should naturally be discussed democratically by the farmers' association and decided by the farmers themselves.

	Rural elementary schools mainly solve the learning problems of farmers' children. The students are mostly farmers' children, and if the school buildings and supplies are not complete, it will affect the learning of farmers' children. Therefore, the government calls on elementary school teachers to explain this principle, so that farmers voluntarily take out part of the fruits to improve school facilities. This is beneficial to both the farmers and the work.

	However, the fruits in each village vary in quantity, and there are many opinions among the people in the countryside. In addition, some of our schools are not well-run enough, and the masses do not support them very much. In order to solve their own more pressing needs, some villages inevitably are unwilling to give them to the school, which is understandable. It cannot be considered that this is the farmers' political backwardness. The word "stubborn" should not be used. If possible, we can only try our best to persuade the masses. Issuing orders is not appropriate.

	From your letter, it can be seen that your work is active, which is very good. But you should study hard, consider problems from all aspects and follow the mass line, and be good at persuading the masses and patiently waiting for the masses to become aware. This will be beneficial to both your work and your understanding.

### 要在土改中筹备出小学用具　政府为啥不下通令？

　　要在土改中筹备出小学用具
  　政府为啥不下通令？编辑同志：
    小学中的校具，不敷所用时，要在土改中筹备出来，可是政府不来通令，而叫教员说服动员，这是多为难的事呢？政治比较进步的村庄，对学校中的校具，还略为关心一点，政治落后之“顽固村”，根本打不通，在农会中筹备，教员的说服动员，完全没有效力，这事应当怎么办呢？政府既说明了在农会中筹备，怎么不下一通令。这是什么缘故呢？望编辑同志说明其意义。

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　小学教员张廷学张廷学同志：
    土改中农民斗争出来的果实，是农民自己的东西，是被地主剥削去自己又要回来的。这些东西的处理，自然应经农会民主讨论，由农民自己来决定。
    农村小学，主要是解决农民子弟的学习问题，受教育者多系农民子弟，校舍、校具等如不完备，会影响农民子弟学习。因而政府号召小学教师讲清这个道理，经过农民自愿拿出一部果实来改善学校设备，这样对农民对工作都有好处。
    但各村果实，有多有少，农村中人多意见多，加上我们有些学校办的不够好，群众不大拥护，为了解决自己目前更迫切的需要，也免不了有些村庄不愿拿出来给学校用，也是难怪的，不能认为这是农民政治的落后，“顽固”二字更不该说，如认为可能的话，只好尽力说服群众，下命令，是不合适的。
    从你的来信中，看出你的工作是积极的，这很好，但要好好学习，从各方面考虑问题和走群众路线，要善于说服群众与耐心等待群众觉悟，对工作上认识上都会有益的。
