　　Xiaolizhuang Blocking Action
  　Our Battalion Shattered the Enemy's Four Main Divisions' Attempt to Break Through
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 29th] A frontline reporter reported that a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) heroically shattered the attempt of the Huang Wei bandit group's four main divisions to break through, stating: At 8:00 AM on the 27th of last month, bandit leader Huang Wei attempted to break through from Xiaolizhuang. He organized four main divisions as the vanguard, using twelve airplanes, eight tanks, and more than a hundred artillery pieces as cover, and a regiment flanking the left wing as a supporting force. On the plain, about six *li* wide, men and horses roared, surging forward. Airplanes shuttled back and forth at low altitude over Xiaolizhuang, bombing and strafing, and various artillery pieces fired at an average rate of more than ten rounds per minute at the PLA positions. Tanks led the infantry to rush forward. A certain battalion of the PLA, guarding the Xiaolizhuang position, had already obtained intelligence of the enemy's breakthrough attempt, received the order to hold the Xiaolizhuang position firmly, and made all preparations to block the enemy. Battalion Commander Li observed the movement of tens of thousands of enemies and firmly shouted, "Comrades, keep calm! In order to annihilate the Huang Wei army group completely, we must not let a single enemy escape from our position!" All the commanders and fighters of the battalion, calmly and tensely, under the cover of artillery shells and bomb explosions, some were repairing the damaged fortifications, some were deploying various types of light and heavy weapons, and special marksmen were engaged in a cold-shooting competition, causing the enemy to fall one after another. Gradually, the enemy moved to the graves about 300 meters in front of the Xiaolizhuang position, and used this area of graves as a starting point for their assault. Under the forced command of the bandit army leaders, the enemy infantry began to risk death and launch a group charge. Battalion Commander Li indicated the firepower targets and immediately ordered firing. Thereupon, the PLA's light and heavy weapons swept towards the enemy like a storm, and artillery pieces of various calibers also opened fire together. Shells fell like raindrops into the enemy's skirmish lines, and piles of enemies fell on their backs and crashed to the ground. In this way, the enemy's repeated assaults were repelled more than ten times. By 9:30 AM, the enemy's artillery fire became even more frantic, and the entire Xiaolizhuang was submerged in the smoke and dust of the artillery fire. The friendly neighboring position of Xiaoliuzhuang on the left wing was temporarily broken through by the enemy, causing Xiaolizhuang to be attacked from both sides. However, the warriors who held the position firmly were determined to coexist with the position. Deputy Squad Leader of the Seventh Squad of the Third Company was wounded but continued to fire at the enemy. The Squad Leader of the Ninth Squad was seriously wounded, and the Deputy Squad Leader sacrificed himself. Soldier Du Ke led the entire squad to continue fighting. The ammunition handler of the machine gun squad of the Second Company also loaded bullets while wounded. When the enemy's tanks rushed to the front, Battalion Commander Li calmly issued the order: "Let them pass, and attack the infantry." The tanks rolled over the fortifications of the First Squad of the First Company, but the enemy infantry was suppressed by the PLA's firepower and could not follow up. However, new difficulties arose. The bullets of each company were running out, and one after another, the communicators went to the battalion command post to report. Battalion Commander Li firmly replied: "If the machine guns run out of bullets, use rifles. If the rifles run out of bullets, use hand grenades. If the hand grenades run out of bullets, use bayonets." The commander's determination inspired everyone. When the enemy advanced to within 100 meters of the position, everyone quickly removed the lids of the hand grenades and threw them one by one at the edge of the fortifications. After throwing all the hand grenades, they pointed their bright bayonets at the enemy, and rows of charging enemies fell under the blades. At this time, powerful friendly forces recovered Xiaoliuzhuang, and fierce artillery fire suppressed the tanks that had already entered the Xiaolizhuang position. Thus, the enemy collapsed. Xiaolizhuang was still guarded by the First Battalion, and the enemy only left behind more than a thousand corpses.

　　小李庄阻击战
  　我一个营粉碎了敌四个主力师的突围企图
    【新华社淮海前线二十九日电】前线记者报导解放军某部一个营英勇粉碎黄维匪部四个主力师的突围经过称：上月二十七日上午八时，匪首黄维企图从小李庄突围。他组织了四个主力师作先锋，以十二架飞机、八辆坦克和百多门大炮作掩护，并以一个团迂回左翼作策应；在约六里宽的平原上，人嚎马嘶，汹涌出动。飞机在小李庄的低空穿梭轰炸，俯冲扫射，各种炮以平均每分钟十余发的速度向解放军阵地排轰，坦克则领导着步兵向前闯。守卫小李庄阵地的解放军某部一营，早已获得了敌人突围的情报，奉到了坚守小李庄阵地的命令，做好了阻击敌人的一切准备。李营长观察了成万敌人的运动情况之后，坚定地高呼着：“同志们，沉着气！为了全歼黄维兵团，绝不让一个敌人从我们阵地上跑掉！”全营的指战员们，镇静而紧张地，在炮弹、炸弹烟火笼罩之下，有的在修补着被毁的工事，有的在调配着各式轻重火器，特等射手们则展开了冷枪竞赛，使敌人一个接一个地倒了下去。渐渐地，敌人运动到小李庄阵地前沿三百公尺的坟地里了，并且把这片坟地作冲锋出发地。在匪军首领强迫驱使之下，敌步兵开始冒死作集团冲锋。李营长指示了火力目标，立即命令射击。于是解放军的轻重火器暴风似地扫向敌人，各种口径大炮也一齐开火，炮弹雨点般地落在敌人的散兵群里，成堆的敌人，人仰马翻，栽倒地下。这样一连击退了敌人反复十余次冲锋。至九时半，敌人的炮火更疯狂了，整个小李庄淹没在炮火的烟尘中。左翼小刘庄的友邻阵地被敌人暂时突破，使小李庄两面受敌。但坚守阵地的勇士们都抱着与阵地共存亡的决心。三连七班班副负了伤，继续射击敌人，九班班长重伤，班副牺牲，战士杜克带领全班继续战斗，二连机枪班弹药手也带伤压子弹。当敌人的坦克冲到跟前的时候，李营长沉着地发出命令：“让它过去，打步兵。”坦克从一连一班的工事上压过去，敌人的步兵，被解放军的火力压制，无法跟进。但是，新的困难又来了，各连的子弹都快完了，通讯员一个又一个地到营指挥所去报告。李营长坚定地答复说：“机枪打完了打步枪，步枪打完了使手榴弹，手榴弹打完了使刺刀。”指挥员的决心激励了大家。当敌人进到阵前百米以内时，大家迅速地揭去手榴弹的盖，一个一个掷在工事的边沿。打完了手榴弹的，则把明晃晃的刺刀指向敌人，一排排冲锋的敌人倒在刀锋之下。这时，强大的友邻部队又收复了小刘庄，猛烈的炮火又压住了已进入小李庄阵地的坦克。于是，敌人溃败了。小李庄仍为第一营所守卫着，敌人只是留下了千余具尸体。
