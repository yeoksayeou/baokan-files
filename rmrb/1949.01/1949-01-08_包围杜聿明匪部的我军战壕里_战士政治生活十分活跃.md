Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 2nd: A front-line reporter reports: In the trenches of the People's Liberation Army around the besieged Du Yuming bandit troops, the political life of the soldiers is very active. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army held a small group meeting in fortifications only a few dozen meters away from the enemy's outpost positions, discussing commendation lists and ways to unite newly liberated soldiers. Although the wartime environment has brought them many difficulties in carrying out activities, they have finally overcome them. For example, the sixth company of a certain unit built a solid large shelter in the position to avoid concentrated meetings that would expose targets and cause heavy casualties. They held grievance meetings for newly liberated soldiers and various discussion forums in the shelter, formulated unity and meritorious service plans, or conducted reading of newspapers, etc. The soldiers gave the large shelter the name "Wartime Office." In the trenches of the fourth company of a certain unit, many commendation leaflets such as "One-Eyed Warrior Ge Jingting" and "Gong Rencai Awarded First-Class Merit" were posted. After the battle, the company headquarters often issued "War Merit Slips" to commend soldiers who had performed meritorious service in combat. These leaflets were also known as "Small Victory Reports," "Merit Lists," or "Praise Orders," etc. The soldiers liked them very much, and they spread these leaflets everywhere. Another important part of the soldiers' political life in the trenches is giving "big lessons" to the enemy. For example, the sixth company of a certain unit dug a fortification near the enemy's position, and the soldiers took turns giving lessons to the enemy from the fortification: "Hey! Brothers in the Kuomintang army! You are tightly surrounded by the People's Liberation Army and cannot escape. The Huang Wei Corps has been completely annihilated. Who else will come to reinforce you? Those who want to live, come out quickly! Don't die for Chiang Kai-shek!" At first, the enemy fired shots, but then there was no sound. Then, two enemy soldiers who surrendered ran from the Wei Shao Yao stronghold. Sometimes, the soldiers climbed to the edge of the chevaux-de-frise to distribute propaganda materials, or fly propaganda flags and hang large slogans to urge the enemy's lower-level officers and soldiers to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. Under the political offensive of the soldiers, five enemies in the Liu Ji stronghold collectively surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army also used the gaps in combat in the trenches to enthusiastically discuss the current war situation and significance. For example, Jiang Huiyuan, a soldier of the seventh company of a certain regiment, said: "The enemy besieged by us (referring to the Qiu and Li Corps) is isolated and without help, without food, lacking ammunition, and facing increasing difficulties day by day. It is destined for us to eliminate them." Fan Xiaoru, a soldier of the fourth squad of the fourth company of a certain regiment, said: "The enemy is locked up by us. He may make a last-ditch effort. If the enemy fights desperately, we will definitely fight him. The enemy's desperate struggle is worthless, and my sacrifice is for the people, which is valuable."

　　包围杜聿明匪部的我军战壕里
  　战士政治生活十分活跃
    【新华社淮海前线二日电】前线记者报导：在被围困的杜聿明匪部四周解放军的战壕里，战士们的政治生活十分活跃。解放军某部在距敌人前哨阵地仅有几十米达的工事里，召开小组会，讨论着报功单及怎样团结新解放战士的办法。战时环境虽然给他们带来了不少进行活动的困难，但是他们终于把它克服了。如某部六连为避免集中开会暴露目标及伤亡大，战士们就在阵地上修起了一个坚固的大隐蔽部。他们在隐蔽部里召开新解放战士的诉苦会及各种座谈会，订团结立功计划或进行读报等。战士们替大隐蔽部起了个“战时办公厅”的名字。某部四连的战壕里，贴着许多如“独眼勇士葛静廷”、“巩仁才立一等功”等表扬传单。在战斗后，连部经常发放“战功单”，表扬作战中的立功战士。这些传单又名“小捷报”，“立功榜”或“赞功令”等。战士们非常喜欢它，他们将这类传单到处传播着。战士们在战壕里政治生活的另一个重要部分，即给敌人上大课。如某部六连靠近敌阵挖了一个工事，战士们便从工事里轮流向敌人上起课来：“喂！国民党军里的弟兄们！你们被解放军包围得紧紧的，跑不出去了，黄维兵团已全部被歼了，还有谁来增援你们？要活命的赶快跑出来吧！不要给蒋介石送命！”开始时敌人还打枪，以后就无声无息了。接着，便从魏少窑据点里跑来两个投诚的敌军士兵。有时，战士们爬到鹿砦边去发宣传品，或打宣传旗、挂大标语，促使敌下级官兵向解放军投诚。在战士们的政治攻势下，刘集据点五个敌人集体向解放军投诚。解放军的战士们在战壕里，还利用战斗空隙，热心座谈当前的战争形势及意义，如某团七连战士蒋会远说：“被咱们围困的敌人（指邱、李兵团）已孤立无援，没有粮食，缺少弹药，一天困难重一天，叫咱消灭是注定了。”某团四连四班战士范小如说：“敌人给我们关起来了，他可能要最后拼一下的。敌人如果拼命，我们也一定与他拼一下。敌人拼死了一钱不值，我牺牲了是为了人民，有价值的。”
