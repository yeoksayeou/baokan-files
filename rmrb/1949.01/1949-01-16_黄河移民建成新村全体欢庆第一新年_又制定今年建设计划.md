(Ji Lu Yu News) The Administrative Office's Yellow River Residents Relocation and Relief Committee was established last June. It relocated Yellow River disaster victims to Weinan Slope in Hua County for reclamation. After half a year of efforts, preliminary achievements have been made. All the settlers, in the newly built United New Village, joyfully celebrated the first New Year's Day since the establishment of the new village on the morning of January 1. Everyone participated in the new group greeting ceremony, paying respect to revolutionary leaders and revolutionary martyrs. Then, the responsible comrade of the Relocation Committee reported on the work of the past six months and the construction implementation outline for the 38th year of the Republic of China (1949). It was mentioned that since the establishment of the committee half a year ago, 63 households of disaster victims have been relocated, and more than 1,300 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, with 1,045 mu planted with wheat and 262 mu planted with vegetables. If there are no natural disasters, the settlers will be able to live a life of plenty. In addition, 20 houses and more than 10 underground dwellings have been built, more than 300 zhang of new roads have been built, an old well has been repaired, and more than 100 zhang of courtyard walls have been built. The construction of the new village is taking shape. On December 20, all the settlers had moved from nearby villages to live in the new village. It is hoped that all settlers will resolutely devote their full spirit to completing the construction implementation outline for the 38th year of the Republic of China: (1) Complete the new village construction plan; (2) Continue to reclaim land and increase production; (3) Plant 3,600 trees; (4) Establish an agricultural experiment station, vegetable garden, and nursery to improve crops; (5) Establish a livestock station to serve agricultural reclamation; (6) Strengthen collective cooperation and individual labor to increase production; (7) Promote sideline occupations such as oil pressing and weaving to increase income; (8) Complete the construction of 200 houses to solve the housing problem for all disaster victims; (9) Dig six wells to solve the difficulties of drinking water and watering gardens, and dig canals to prevent floods; (10) Establish schools to eliminate illiteracy; (11) Establish a new rural market to facilitate rural supply and marketing. After the report, everyone shouted slogans, expressing their determination to complete these tasks. They also cheered "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation!" On the same morning, a flag was presented to Fengying Village in gratitude for their donation of land (for the residential base of the disaster victims). The two villages were united and friendly, and they had a happy day. In the afternoon at 6 pm, an evening party was held to add to the fun.
