　　Bank Loans Should Not Be Blind: Clarify Purpose and Conduct Thorough Inspections
    Comrade Editor:
    Having read the article "Certain Private Merchants in Handan Violate Laws, Engage in Speculation, and Are Sanctioned" published on the first page of your newspaper on December 13th, the Yifeng Thread Factory in that city was established with over 1.9 million yuan of pooled funds from merchants, workers, shop assistants, and other members of the public. This year, the bank loaned the factory 26 million yuan, which is thirteen times its original capital. Judging from this loan being many times greater than the original capital, the blindness of the loan is significant. Was a detailed review of the factory's loan purpose not conducted? Was the loan for increasing equipment because the factory lacked production raw materials or had too few tools, affecting production expansion? Or was it because the factory was in a slow season, finished products could not be sold, and the accumulation of capital was too large, making it impossible to continue production? If such circumstances exist, loans can be provided to support continued production. However, the loan amount must be appropriate based on the actual needs of business turnover, and the use of the loan should be supervised after it is granted. The factory borrowed so much money; was it borrowed all at once or in several installments? If it was borrowed in installments, previous loans should have been repaid before new loans were granted when there was an actual need. If, in addition to loans from the state bank, the factory also borrowed from private banks, the borrower's asset-liability situation should have been understood during the loan review to determine whether to grant the loan. In short, the bank not only did not conduct effective review work but also did not conduct "loan inspection" work. As a result, the factory's "manager, Wang Yaoxian, did not develop the business but engaged in speculation, losing more than 3 million yuan. After the furniture funds were lost, he still owed more than 1 million yuan in foreign debts." Additionally, "the two joint businesses, the Masses Flower Shop and the New Life Oil Mill, with a total capital of only 4 million yuan, lavishly built storefronts, exhausting their capital and still owing more than 10 million yuan in foreign debts. They also borrowed 5 million yuan from the Masses Credit Cooperative, and as a result, the foreign debts were not repaid, and the manager ran away." From the results of these two businesses, the development of industry and commerce is seriously harmed. During wartime, when commercial profits were high, many industrialists and merchants engaged in speculation and made money out of nothing, which should attract the attention of the state bank and the social financial community, and they should learn from this experience. Regardless of whether it is a state bank or a mass credit cooperative under the guidance of the bank, or private money shops, social credit investigation work should be carried out to understand the actual business development of various industrialists and merchants and their creditworthiness as one of the bases for banks to provide loans to support production. Furthermore, when making loans, effective and strict review of the loan purpose should be conducted, and appropriate loans should be granted based on the actual need for funds for business turnover. Generally, loans should not exceed the capital of the original business or factory. If the business development requires it and the credit is very good, more loans can be granted, but they should not exceed too much. Loans should not be granted if the actual situation of business development is not well understood, or reliable guarantors should be found to supervise the use of the loan. After the loan is granted, "loan inspection" work must be carried out (the borrower can be asked to make a detailed balance sheet to understand the actual situation). If the use is inappropriate, it should be recovered immediately. Our New Democratic state bank financial institutions should establish, maintain, guarantee, and consolidate the credit of the social financial and industrial and commercial sectors, stabilize prices, and enable industrialists and merchants to engage in legitimate production activities and develop industry and commerce. Otherwise, blind loans from banks or social financial sectors will not only be harmful to the social development of industry and commerce but also destroy social credit, causing industrialists and merchants to close their doors and run away. Therefore, I suggest that your newspaper publish this article to urge the Handan Municipal Party and government organs to conduct an in-depth inspection of the state bank's business work, improve its business, and strengthen the city's industrial and commercial management work.　Dian Qing

　　银行贷款不应盲目　要明确用途深入检查
    编辑同志：
    看到贵报十二月十三日第一版登载：“邯郸某些私商违犯法令，投机取巧，受到制裁”一稿内，该市的怡丰线工厂是商人、工人、店员等的群众性集股金一百九十余万元所开办，今年银行对该厂贷款两千六百万元，为原资本金的十三倍，从这个贷款大于原资本的倍数来看，其贷款的盲目性是很大的。没有对该厂的贷款用途作详细的审查，是该厂的生产原料缺少，或工具过少，以致影响生产扩大而需要增设工具贷款呢？再或者是该厂处在淡月，生产成品推销不了，积压资本过大，无法进行再生产呢？如在这种种情形下，可以贷款扶助，继续生产。但贷款的数字，必须从业务周转上的实际需要，进行适当的贷款，贷款后应监督其用途。该厂贷的那么多款，不知是一次贷的，还是几次贷的？如系几次而贷出者应该是还了前次贷款，有实际需要时再贷，如果是除在国家银行贷款外，还贷私人银号的款，就应在审查贷款时，了解贷户的资产负债情形决定是否贷给。总之银行贷款不但没有作很有效的审查工作，也没有作“查贷”工作，结果该厂“经理王耀先不发展业务，一味进行投机，赔三百多万元，家具资金赔光后，还欠了一百多万元外债。”另外“群众花店、新生油房的两家联号共资本才四百万元，就大肆修筑门市房屋，把资本占光了，还欠了一千多万元外债，并贷群众信用部五百万元款，结果外债都未还而经理就偷跑了。”从上两家的结果上看，是严重的危害着工商业的发展，在战时商业利润高的情形下，工商业进行投机作没本生意，吃“过水面”的情形是不少的，应引起国家银行社会金融界注意，接受这一经验教训的，不管国家银行或银行指导下的群众性的信用社，及私营银钱业，都应作社会信用调查工作，了解各工商业家的实际业务发展情形，信用好坏，作为银行等贷款扶助生产的根据之一。再就是在贷款时应作有效的，严格的审查贷款用途，根据业务周转上的实际需要资金数进行适当的贷款，一般的贷款不应超过原商号、工厂的资本金数为好，如果业务发展上很需要，信用也很好，也可以多贷些，也不应超过过多。对业务发展实情不甚了解不应贷款，或找可靠的保人监督其贷款用途，也可以贷给。在贷款后必须作“查贷”工作（可让该贷户作详细的资产负债表了解实情），如用途不当时，应立即收回。我们新民主主义的国家银行金融机关应作到建立、维持、保证、巩固社会金融界工商界的信用，稳定物价，使工商业家都安心进行生产等正当的业务，发展工商业，否则银行或社会金融界等盲目的贷款，不但对社会发展工商业有害无利，而破坏社会信用，工商业闭门逃跑。因此建议贵报将此文公布，而以督促邯郸市党政机关对国家银行业务工作作一深入的检查，并改进其业务，与加强该市的工商业管理工作。　奠青
