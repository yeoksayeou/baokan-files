Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 8th. The great annihilation battle northeast of Yongcheng is continuing to develop. After annihilating eleven enemy regiments by forenoon on the 7th, the People's Liberation Army again captured Wangzhuang (west of Lilou) at dusk on the 7th, annihilating the entire 288th Regiment of the 96th Division of the 70th Army of the enemy's Qiu Qingquan Corps. At the same time, Weilao was captured, annihilating the entire 94th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the 70th Army. The enemy's 335th Regiment of the 112th Division of the 12th Army at Zuo Village (north of Liuji) surrendered to the Liberation Army at 10 p.m. that night. Under the fierce attack of the Liberation Army, the entire enemy Li retreated in a panic to the west, and the Liberation Army continued to recover Qinglongji, where the headquarters of the Li was located, and the twenty villages and strongholds north of it, including Zhaoyuan, Shuangzhuang, Sunzhuang, Zhuzhuang, Gengzhuang, Meng'ao, Qiuzhuang, Zhouzhuang, Chenzhuang, Wangzhuang, Konglou, Mazhuang, Haozhuang, Wanzhuang, Xiazhai, Wangzhuang (west of Lilou), Weilao, and Zuozhai. Now the remnants of the enemy Li's 8th Army, 9th Army, New 59th Army, and Qiu's 5th Army, 72nd Army, 74th Army, and 12th Army, have nowhere to go, are in a mess, squeezed into a group, and are being bombarded by the artillery fire of the Liberation Army everywhere. The Liberation Army further narrowed the encirclement, compressing the remaining enemy force of about 130,000 troops into a small area of ten miles east-west and seven miles north-south in villages such as Liuji, Guo (Yao), Lilou, Mulou, Loulou, Zhangzhuang, Huzhuang, Zhulou, Liuzhuang, Zhoulou, Kouzhuang, and Wudazhuang, and is continuing to encircle and annihilate them.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 8th. Under the call of "Completely Annihilate the Enemy Qiu and Li Corps and Strive for the Complete Victory of the Huaihai Campaign," the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are braving the severe cold after the snow and are fighting heroically with redoubled efforts. Morale is unprecedentedly high, and tactics, techniques, and combat actions have shown good performance. The attack began on the afternoon of the 6th. Our army's infantry and artillery coordinated closely, and the firepower was tightly organized, completely overwhelming the enemy's firepower. The attacking troops charged fiercely and broke into the enemy's position in one fell swoop, quickly resolving the enemy. For example, Guo Ying was captured, and an enemy regiment was completely annihilated after only one hour of combat. In the Xiazhuang battle, an enemy regiment and a battalion of another regiment were completely annihilated in only half an hour. Within four hours, seven or eight villages and strongholds were captured, and seven or eight enemy regiments were annihilated, while our own casualties were very few.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 9th. Under the strong military pressure of the Liberation Army and the political offensive on the front line, more than 14,000 officers and soldiers of the Du Yuming bandit troops, who were besieged in the northeastern Yongcheng area, surrendered to the Liberation Army in the twenty days from the 17th of last month to the 5th of this month. Regarding this matter, the Huaihai Front Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has recently issued a public announcement as follows: Since the beginning of the third stage of the Huaihai Campaign on December 17th of last year, our army, in order to spare the officers and soldiers of the Du Yuming Department who were trapped in the siege from unnecessary sacrifices and to give them a chance to survive and seek death, has vigorously carried out front-line shouting, broadcasting, sending letters of persuasion to surrender, distributing large numbers of leaflets and slogans, and other forms of struggle to win over the enemy army. The enemy troops surrendered to our army one after another, reaching more than 14,000 people by the 5th of this month, equivalent to more than two divisions of the enemy army. Among them, those who surrendered collectively included all of the remaining troops of the Kuomintang 41st Army's Independent 9th Regiment's 2nd Battalion, all of the 5th Army's 200th Division's Advance Contingent, all of the 70th Army's 32nd Division's 95th Regiment's 1st Battalion, all of the 9th Army's 253rd Division's 759th Regiment's 2nd Battalion, all of the 3rd Battalion's 9th Company, and all of the New 59th Army's 540th Regiment's Engineering Company. Among the surrendering officers, those who have been identified include eight at the regimental level or above, ten at the battalion level, forty-eight at the company level, and thirty at the platoon level. Among the officers above the battalion level, there are Geng Jiwu, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Kuomintang Security of Jiangsu Province, Li Yadong, commander of the Special Operations Contingent of the 5th Army's 200th Brigade, Yan Ziliang, deputy commander of the 95th Regiment and commander of the 1st Battalion of the 70th Army's 32nd Division, Shen Mengqi, chief of the 2nd Section of the Staff Department of the 32nd Division, Gu Bogeng, lieutenant colonel deputy commander of the 598th Regiment (formerly the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Headquarters Guard Regiment) of the 5th Army's 200th Division, Li Baichun, commander of the Tongshan Regiment Management District, Teng Hongchen, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 41st Army's Independent 9th Regiment, Zhang Jiesan, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 759th Regiment of the 9th Army's 253rd Division, and many others. The weapons brought by the surrendered officers and soldiers included one anti-tank gun, eight mortars, eight 60mm mortars, six grenade launchers, four heavy machine guns, one hundred and fifteen light machine guns, one hundred and five Thompson submachine guns, carbines, and submachine guns, nine hundred and ninety-six rifles and carbines, seventeen pistols, and one radio station.
