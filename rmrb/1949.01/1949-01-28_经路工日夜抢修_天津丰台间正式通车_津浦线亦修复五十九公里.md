　　Through Day and Night Repair by Railway Workers
　　Tianjin-Fengtai Section Officially Opens to Traffic
　　Tianjin-Pukou Railway Also Repairs 59 Kilometers
    [Tianjin Electric] The railway between Tianjin and Fengtai on the Beining Railway and between Tianjin and Chenguantun on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway resumed traffic on the 22nd. Before the liberation of Tianjin, the Chiang bandits greatly damaged the above two sections of railway. They dug communication trenches in the roadbed, dismantled many rails and sleepers to build bunkers, and buried a large number of landmines on both sides of the railway, making it extremely difficult to restore traffic. After the liberation of the city, the Tianjin Military Control Commission immediately sent personnel to take over the Tianjin offices of the Pingjin and Jinpu Railway Bureaus and actively led railway employees to carry out repairs. The workers swept landmines along the way, collected sleepers, and worked day and night to repair the lines. Many workers in the transportation department also participated in laying the tracks, and some workers did not rest for two days and nights. They said: "The railway is our home and our livelihood, so let’s get the traffic running quickly.” After day and night repairs, both lines have been opened to traffic. The Tianjin-Fengtai section of the Beining Railway is 121 kilometers long, and the Tianjin-Chenguantun section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is 59 kilometers long.

　　经路工日夜抢修
  　天津丰台间正式通车
  　津浦线亦修复五十九公里
    【天津电】北宁路天津丰台间和津浦路天津陈官屯间铁路已于二十二日恢复通车。津市解放前，蒋匪曾对上述两段铁路大肆破坏。在路基上挖掘交通沟，将许多铁轨、枕木拆去修筑碉堡，并在铁路两旁埋设大量地雷，使恢复通车发生重大困难。该市解放后，天津市军管会当即派员将平津、津浦两路局天津办事处接收，并积极领导铁路员工进行抢修。工人们一面扫除沿路地雷，搜集枕木，一面昼夜抢修。很多车务方面的工人也参加了钉道，有的工人两昼夜没有休息。他们说：“铁路是我们的家，是我们的饭碗，赶快通了车。”经昼夜抢修，两路均已通车。按北宁路天津至丰台段全长一百二十一公里，津浦路天津至陈官屯段长五十九公里。
