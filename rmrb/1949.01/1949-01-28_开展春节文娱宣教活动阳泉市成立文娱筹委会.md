　　[Yangquan News] With the Spring Festival approaching, Yangquan City, in accordance with the masses' habit of celebrating with gusto, has specially established a Spring Festival Cultural and Entertainment Preparatory Committee and issued instructions pointing out that cultural and entertainment propaganda activities should be actively carried out and strengthened, and must be conducted in an organized and led manner to prevent spontaneous development. The purpose of cultural and entertainment activities is to strengthen people's unity, increase production enthusiasm, encourage support for the front, and lay the foundation for the democratic construction movement; such as commending workers' production models, inventions, and calling for production and conservation. Praising peasants' emancipation, rural unity, the end of land reform, the issuance of land certificates, and commending model cadres who lead production and work actively. And in conjunction with the current victorious situation, exposing the Jiang-Mei (Chiang Kai-shek and the US) peace-seeking conspiracy to deepen education for the masses and raise political awareness. In cultural and entertainment activities, based on the past old village street school troupes, small-scale Yangko dances, Ba Wang Bian (Overlord Whip), stilts, shadow plays, storytelling with drums, and clapper talks that are popular with the masses should be developed as much as possible. Strict written propaganda is required, and couplets and arches must have revolutionary propaganda slogans, based on the Spring Festival couplets published by the People's Daily on December 23 last year. In addition, on specific issues, instruct the heads of each troupe, propaganda cadres, and old and new artists' symposium to convey arrangements, exchange experiences, strengthen member education, and oppose improper behavior. New plays should be reviewed and approved by relevant authorities. Performances of old plays must also be approved, and those that promote slave morality, national betrayal, feudal oppression, and superstitious and obscene ideas are prohibited. Various agencies and shops can hold evening parties separately, from January 20 to February 20, but this should be based on the habits of the masses and should not interfere with production. In addition, cultural and entertainment competitions will be held, and models will be rewarded.
　　[Another News] Yangquan City convened a symposium on carrying out Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities in urban areas on the 18th of this month. More than 30 representatives from factories, agencies, organizations, schools, the People's Theater, District 1, and old artists attended the meeting. After the instructions of the Preparatory Committee were conveyed at the meeting, each unit reported on the situation. Each unit was very enthusiastic about this work. For example, the Sanhe Factory was rehearsing two plays created by the workers themselves before the meeting. Vocational schools and municipal primary schools also spent their spare time rehearsing new plays, and planned to keep a certain number of students and teachers for cultural and entertainment activities during the holidays. Some public factories also voluntarily proposed to guarantee the performance of cultural and entertainment programs during the Spring Festival. The division of labor was also decided to control the time and delineate the scenes. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to hold a cultural and entertainment competition within a certain range when the Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities end, commend models, review shortcomings, learn from experience, and lay a good foundation for future cultural and entertainment activities.
