To the Editor:

I am Liu Bingling from Xichu Village, Yuanshi County, and I am thirty-three years old. In April two years ago, I contracted an illness. It started with coughing and spitting phlegm. I consulted a doctor and took two doses of medicine, and I recovered. In June, I drank a few cups of wine while entertaining friends, and the illness relapsed. Initially, my throat was hoarse, I coughed, and I spat phlegm. From then on, it got worse day by day. By February of last year, it was even worse than before. Not only did I spit phlegm, but I was also short of breath. My body became thinner day by day, and every time I spit out a large amount of greenish phlegm. Recently, I am not only unable to walk, but when I sleep, I inevitably cough a lot in the morning when I wake up. The sputum I spit out has a bit of an earthy smell, and my urine is often yellow. However, in terms of eating, I am the same as when I was not sick, and I don't eat any less. It's just that my body is getting weaker day by day. I would be grateful if you could reply with information on how to treat this illness.

Answer: Based solely on your description and without examination, we cannot definitively say what illness you have. It could be pulmonary tuberculosis or chronic bronchitis. However, based on your age and the fact that the illness appeared suddenly and was quickly cured, chronic bronchitis is more likely. Whether it is bronchitis or pulmonary tuberculosis, the methods of recuperation are not contradictory but consistent. Now, I will introduce a method of recuperation to you. As long as you implement it well, it will definitely be beneficial. The method is as follows:

　　One, pay attention to changing clothes to prevent colds.

　　Two, pay attention to diet, do not be picky eaters, do not overeat, eat more nutritious things, and try various methods to increase appetite.

　　Three, keep the doors and windows of the house open to keep the air clean, but do not catch a cold.

　　Four, avoid all kinds of causes that can aggravate your illness (such as drinking alcohol, smoking, catching a cold, and overwork).

　　Five, do not have mental burdens. Mental burdens are not good for the illness but will affect the body (for example, if there is a burden, diet and sleep will definitely be affected, and therefore the body will be damaged).

　　Six, if you have troublesome symptoms (such as coughing, night sweats, etc.) and have doubts or are worried, you can seek a doctor to resolve them.

　　吐痰带土腥气是什么病？编辑同志：
    我是元氏县西褚村人，名叫刘冰令，现年三十三岁，在前年四月间得了一病，起初是咳嗽吐痰，经医生治了一回，吃药两付，病即好了。到六月间，因招待朋友喝了几杯酒，病又复发，起初嗓子哑、咳嗽、吐痰，从此一天比一天重起来，到去年二月间比前更重，不但吐痰而且气短。身体一天瘦一天，并且每次吐青色的痰一大堆，到最近不但不能走路，而且在睡觉时早晨起时必然大量咳嗽一回，所吐的痰带些土腥气，小便经常是黄色的。但在吃饭方面还如无病时一样，并不少吃一点。就是身体一天弱一天。关于这病如何治法，请答复为盼。

    答：你的病仅按你的主诉没经检查，我们不能肯定的说是个什么病，可能是肺结核，也可能是慢性气管支炎。但据你的年龄，及突然发病很快的就治好了，性气管支炎的可能性较大。气管支炎也好，肺结核也好，他的休养方法没有矛盾，而是一致的。今介绍你一个休养方法，只要好好的执行，一定有好处的。方法如下：
    一、衣服之脱换要注意，切防感冒。
    二、饮食上注意，不偏食，不过食，多用有养料的东西，想各种方法使食欲增加。
    三、住的房子要常开门窗，使空气清洁，但不要感冒着。
    四、避免一切能使你的病加重的各种原因（如喝酒、吸烟、伤风感冒、及过度疲劳等）。
    五、不要有精神上的负担，精神上的负担是对病没有好处的，反而影响身体（如一有负担则饮食睡眠一定受影响，因之身体亦就坏了）。
    六、有苦恼的症状时（如咳嗽、盗汗等）及有疑问不放心时，可找医生解决之。
