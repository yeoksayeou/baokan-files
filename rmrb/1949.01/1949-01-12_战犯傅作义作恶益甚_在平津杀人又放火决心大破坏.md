Xinhua News Agency, Suburbs of Peking, 9th—Fu Zuoyi's recent series of criminal actions in Peking and Tianjin further reveal the狰狞 face of this war criminal to the citizens of Peking and Tianjin. According to the Kuomintang Central News Agency's own admission, on the evening of the 5th, Fu Zuoyi arrested over 900 people in Peking alone. Fu Zuoyi established a Party, Government, and Military Supervisory Department in Peking, with Chu Xichun as the director, and announced so-called "those who disobey orders will be killed," "those who perform poorly in combat will be killed," "those who retreat in battle will be killed," "those who disrupt public order will be killed," "those who spread rumors will be killed," and other killing decrees, and has already killed over 20 people. Following the killings, there is arson. Fu Zuoyi continues to set fire to or demolish entire batches of villages in the suburbs of Peking and Tianjin. Even Fu Zuoyi's spokesmen admit that this has left many good people homeless. The so-called "many" is actually tens of thousands. Fu Zuoyi also set fire to the Zhengzhong Bookstore Printing Experimental Factory outside Fuchengmen in the western suburbs of Peking and shelled the paper mill in Tianjin, indicating his determination to destroy national wealth and prevent the People's Liberation Army from taking over. The extremely vicious Fu Zuoyi has truly lived up to the ancient saying, "Magistrates are allowed to burn down houses, but common people are not allowed to light lamps." Although the People's Liberation Army has repaired the high-voltage power lines from the Shijingshan Power Plant to Peking, and has been supplying electricity to the people of Peking since the 27th of last month, Fu Zuoyi actually sent troops to guard the Jibei Power Company in the city on the same day, preventing the reception of electricity. From the 28th of last month, Fu Zuoyi changed to even more vicious tactics: accepting the electricity from the People's Liberation Army, but prohibiting the citizens from using it, and only allowing it to be used for the bandit's agencies, flour mills, radios, broadcasting, streetlights used for "maintaining public order," and strictly limiting the citizens' use of tap water. In order to prevent the people from knowing that the People's Liberation Army has already supplied a large amount of electricity, Fu Zuoyi shamelessly spread rumors that the electricity was supplied by Tianjin and by their own power generation plants in the city. Therefore, although the daily electricity supply to Peking has reached 5,000 to 7,000 kilowatts since the 30th of last month, the people of Peking still do not have access to electric lights and tap water. A popular saying in Peking goes: Tangshan is happy to death, Tianjin is starving to death, and Peking is thirsty to death. These are just some of the actual actions of war criminal Fu Zuoyi while expressing "seeking peace" in the same way as Chiang Kai-shek.

### 战犯傅作义作恶益甚　在平津杀人又放火决心大破坏

　　战犯傅作义作恶益甚
  　在平津杀人又放火决心大破坏
    【新华社平郊九日电】傅匪作义近日在平津的一连串罪恶行动，向平津市民进一步表明了他的战争罪犯的狰狞面貌。据国民党中央社自供：五日一晚傅匪在北平就逮捕了九百余人。傅匪在北平组织了一个党政军督察总监部，由楚溪春任总监，宣布了所谓“不听指挥者杀”，“作战不力者杀”，“临阵退缩者杀”，“扰乱治安者杀”，“造谣生事者杀”等等杀条，并已杀死二十余人。连着杀人，就是放火。傅匪在平津两地继续放火焚毁或拆毁市郊整批的村庄。甚至傅匪的发言人都承认，以致若干良善人民无家可归。所谓若干，实则是几万。傅匪又纵火焚烧北平西郊阜成门外的正中书局印刷实验厂，并炮轰天津的纸厂，表示他们决心破坏国家财富而不让人民解放军接收。穷凶极恶的傅匪真正做到了古语所谓“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”。人民解放军虽然修复了石景山发电厂通至北平城内的高压电线，并自上月二十七日开始为北平市人民送电，但傅匪当日竟派兵看守城内冀北电力总公司，制止受电。从上月二十八日起，傅匪换了更恶毒的办法：接受人民解放军的电，但禁止市民使用，而只许用于匪方的机关、火磨、无线电、广播、为“维持治安”而用的路灯，以及严格限制市民使用的自来水。傅匪为了不让人民知道解放军已经大量送电，竟无耻地造谣说这个电是天津送来的和他们自己在城内磨电所送的。因此，虽然自上月三十日起，北平每日受电量已达五千至七千启罗瓦特，北平市的人民仍然得不到电灯和自来水。北平市流行的歌谣说：唐山乐死，天津饿死，北平渴死。这些就是战争罪犯傅匪作义在与蒋介石同样表示“求和”时的实际行动的一部分。
