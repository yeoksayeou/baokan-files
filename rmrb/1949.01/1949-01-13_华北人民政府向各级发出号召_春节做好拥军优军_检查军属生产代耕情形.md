　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China People's Government issued instructions on December 30 regarding supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and martyrs during the Spring Festival, and inspecting the production and substitute farming situation of military dependents, stating: During the Spring Festival, all localities should carry out work to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen and martyrs, with the primary emphasis on publicizing victory news, explaining that the Chiang bandits will be basically eliminated in about a year, and that the main tasks of North China are production and supporting the front, in order to encourage the masses to support the army, give preferential treatment to families of servicemen, support the front, and participate in the war. It also mobilizes military dependents, families of martyrs, demobilized soldiers, and workers' families to work hard in production to welcome victory.

　　Where regular troops, supplementary training corps, rear hospitals, and veterans' schools are stationed or pass through, all localities should mobilize the masses to carry out spiritual comfort activities, hold joint recreational activities, and provide various conveniences to the troops according to the system, but public funds must not be used. Spiritual preferential treatment for families of servicemen and martyrs in various localities can be carried out according to custom: such as paying New Year's greetings to families of servicemen and martyrs and veterans, singing stories of model families of servicemen and martyrs and veterans, hanging honorary lanterns, pasting Spring Festival couplets, and sitting in the front row when watching operas, etc. However, for military dependents whose children have already performed meritorious service, their political status should be particularly enhanced, congratulatory meetings should be held, and the commendable and congratulatory deeds of the military dependents should be reported to the troops at the front. Material preferential treatment should follow the principle of thrift and should not form wasteful large banquets. Simple and unadorned tea parties can be convened (veterans' worker families can also participate), and the expenses can be approved by the county government and paid from village funds. For the elderly, infirm, and disabled among the families of servicemen and martyrs, who are in very difficult circumstances and cannot celebrate the New Year, the village representatives' meeting (or the government) may discuss and the county and district governments may approve a moderate amount of relief; however, the maximum amount for each person in rural areas should not exceed 12 jin of millet, and the maximum amount for each person in urban areas should not exceed 18 jin of millet, which should be paid from local preferential treatment grain. Regarding the resettlement of families of servicemen, martyrs, veterans, and workers' families in cities, the city governments should conduct special studies, and try their best to introduce employment and participation in production, and should not rely solely on relief. Families of servicemen, martyrs, and workers' families in newly recovered areas, because they have suffered from enemy destruction and have been displaced in the past, will inevitably have more difficulties, and efforts should be made to mobilize the masses to help each other in resettlement and to mobilize them to engage in production for self-salvation. In addition, comfort bag and comfort letter campaigns can be launched in cities, factories, organs, and schools, and a campaign for village cadres and military dependents to write letters to soldiers can be launched in rural areas, but it is absolutely not allowed to use this as an opportunity to ask the masses to contribute money in any form, in order to take care of the burden on farmers.

　　The work of giving preferential treatment to the army is not about temporary fanfare, but about regular activities on a daily basis, with the focus on organizing production, establishing family businesses, and doing a good job of substitute farming. This year, however, many have fallen into a state of neglect, lacking timely inspection and supervision, and inadequate care has been given to military dependents and families of martyrs who lack labor. Therefore, inspections should be carried out and arrangements should be made anew during the period from the Spring Festival to the start of spring plowing:

　　1. Inspect the production situation of military dependents, families of martyrs, workers' families, and veterans this year, and formulate production and resettlement plans for next year, especially mobilizing and organizing them to accumulate fertilizer, purchase production tools, raise livestock on their own, women participate in labor, and carry out various side occupations, in response to next year's call to "increase production by an inch," elect this year's production models, criticize lazy elements, and conduct a survey of the situation of military dependents, families of martyrs, and workers' families in various localities (separate arrangements will be made for veterans' surveys).

　　2. Inspect substitute farming to achieve fairness and efficiency. The enjoyment of substitute farming should be fair and reasonable, so that all military dependents and families of martyrs who lack labor or whose labor is insufficient, and who cannot solve their livelihood problems by other means, can enjoy substitute farming separately; and those who have sufficient labor to farm on their own or have other means to make a living should not enjoy it. Workers' families who lack labor and have no other means of making a living should also be given appropriate substitute farming (still handled in accordance with the previous Joint Office of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Area Committee's Min She Zi No. 8 Circular: that is, generally no substitute farming, special cases substitute farming a part of the land, or substitute farming the main labor part of a part of the land). Veterans should only be given substitute farming for their share of land if their families of special, first, and second class veterans lack labor. Whether substitute farming is in line with the above principles is the first point to be inspected.

　　The burden of substitute farming should be fair, so that labor, semi-labor, and animal power engaged in agricultural labor all bear the burden, and it should be calculated in conjunction with wartime service. Workers and merchants can convert it into wartime service rice (those who take industry and commerce as a sideline are not included), while teachers and students do not bear the burden. It should be checked whether there is a tendency for village cadres and militiamen not to bear the burden of substitute farming, or a tendency for workers and merchants to be unable to find employment and teachers and students to be unable to teach due to substitute farming. Villages with a heavy burden of substitute farming should reduce wartime service, but it should also be checked whether there is a tendency to deliberately engage in more substitute farming or falsely report substitute farming in order to evade wartime service. This is the second point to be inspected.

　　The organization of the substitute farming team should be efficient, so as to avoid wasting civilian labor and not doing a good job of substitute farming. The methods of allocating labor for substitute farming, arbitrarily assigning labor for substitute farming, or taking turns for substitute farming should be abolished. Instead, the task of substitute farming should be clearly assigned, so that specific personnel are responsible for it, and it should be combined with production mutual aid organizations. The organizational situation of the substitute farming team is the third point to be inspected.

　　The strength of the substitute farming team members' sense of responsibility affects the harvest of substitute farming. Substitute farming models should be elected, and irresponsible persons should be criticized. This is the fourth point to be inspected.

　　The above work should be carried out with a certain amount of effort in coordination with the central work, and a summary report should be submitted to the government upon completion.

### 华北人民政府向各级发出号召　春节做好拥军优军　检查军属生产代耕情形

　　华北人民政府向各级发出号召
  　春节做好拥军优军
  　检查军属生产代耕情形
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于十二月三十日发出关于春节拥军优军与检查军属生产代耕的指示称：春节期间，各地应进行拥护军队、优待军属、烈属工作，首重宣传胜利消息，说明一年左右即将基本上消灭蒋匪，华北主要任务为生产与支前，以鼓励群众拥军优军、支前参战，并动员军属烈属荣退军人及工属努力生产，迎接胜利。
    凡各地驻有或路过正规部队、补训兵团、后方医院及荣军学校者，应发动群众进行精神慰劳，举行联欢文娱活动，依制度予军队以各种方便，但不得开支公款。各地对军属烈属之精神优待，可依习惯进行：如向军属烈属荣军拜年，演唱模范军属烈属荣退军人故事，挂光荣灯，贴春联，看戏坐前排等。但对其子弟业已立功之军属，则应特别提高其政治地位，举行贺功会，并以军属之可喜可贺事迹向前方军队报告。物质优待则应依节约原则，不可形成大会餐等浪费，可召集简单朴素之茶话会（荣军工属亦可参加），其费用经县政府批准，由村款开支。凡军属烈属中之孤老残病，家境十分困难，无法过年者，得由村代表会（或政府）评议，县区政府批准，酌予救济；但乡村每人最高不得超过小米十二斤，城市每人最高不得超过小米十八斤，由地方优军粮内开支。城市军属、烈属、荣军、工属之安置，各城市政府应作专题研究，尽量介绍职业，参加生产，不可单依救济。新收复地区之军属烈属工属，因过去受敌人摧残流亡在外，其困难必然较多，应尽量动员群众互助安置，并发动他们生产自救。此外尚可在城市、工厂、机关、学校发动慰劳袋与慰劳信运动，在乡村发动村干与军属给军人写信的运动，但绝不可以任何形式借此要群众出钱，以照顾农民负担。
    优军工作，不在一时之轰轰烈烈，而在平日之经常进行，其重点在组织生产，建立家务并办好代耕，而今年则多陷自流，缺乏及时的检查督促，对无劳力的军属烈属照顾不够，故应于春节至春耕开始期间，进行检查并重新布置：
    一、检查军属烈属工属及荣退军人本年生产情况，并制定明年生产安家计划，特别是动员组织他们积肥，购置生产工具，自喂牲口，妇女参加劳动，并进行各种副业，以响应明年“生产长一寸”的号召，选举今年生产模范，批评怠惰分子，并可将各地军属烈属工属情况作一调查（荣军调查另有布置）。
    二、检查代耕，求得公平而有效率，享受代耕要公平合理，使凡无劳动力或劳力不足的军属烈属，用其他办法仍不足以解决其生活问题者，均能分别享受代耕；而有劳力足能自种或有其他办法足能谋生者，则不应享受。凡工属之无劳力，并无其他办法谋生者，亦应酌予代耕（仍按前晋冀鲁豫边府与晋察冀边委会联合办公时期所发之民社字第八号通令办理：即一般不代耕，特殊者代耕一部土地，或代耕其一部土地之主要劳动部分）。荣军则仅特等、一、二等之家无劳动力者，其本人之一份土地可予代耕，代耕是否合乎上述原则，为应检查之第一点。
    代耕负担要公平，使从事农业劳动的劳力、半劳力、畜力，均行负担，并与战勤结合计算。工人商人可折战勤米（以工商为副业者不在此例），教员学生则不负担。应检查是否有村干民兵不负担代耕的偏向，或因代耕而使工人商人无法就业，教员学生无法教学的偏向。凡代耕负担较重的村，应减少战勤，但又要检查是否有故意多代耕或虚报代耕以逃避战勤的偏向，此为应检查的第二点。
    代耕队之组织要讲求效率，以免浪费民力而代耕不好。应取消拨差代耕、随意派工代耕、或轮流代耕的办法。改为把代耕任务分配明确，使有专人负责，并与生产互助组织相结合。代耕队的组织情况为应检查的第三点。
    代耕队员责任心的强弱，影响到代耕的收成，应选举代耕模范，并对不负责任者予以批评，此为要检查之第四点。
    以上工作均应抽出一定力量配合中心工作进行，并于完成后总结报府。
