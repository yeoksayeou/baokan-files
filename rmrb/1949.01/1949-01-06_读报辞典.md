　　The Sterling Area – The pound sterling is the name of the British standard currency, just as the silver dollar is the name of the Chinese standard currency. Imperialist countries, in order to carry out economic aggression abroad, exploit and plunder the wealth of foreign people to satisfy the endless desires of their domestic capitalists, force other countries to use the currency of the imperialist countries; or stipulate a ratio so that the currency of other countries rises and falls with the currency of the imperialist countries, losing independence and becoming an appendage of the currency of the imperialist countries. In this way, the currency of imperialist countries can have a large scope of circulation, can invest and do business everywhere, control the market, and achieve the purpose of economic aggression. The Sterling Area was officially formed in September 1931 for this purpose. At that time, in addition to including the various autonomous territories, colonies, and former League of Nations mandated territories of British imperialism, there were also Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark in northern Europe, Portugal in the western Mediterranean, Egypt in Africa, and Argentina in South America. At that time, British imperialism also competed with Japanese imperialism to include China in the Sterling Area. However, after the "September 18th Incident," Japanese imperialism's aggression against China was, of course, the most brutal. The power of the pound sterling was far inferior to that of the yen. After the Second World War, the power of British imperialism was weakened, and the aggression of American imperialism expanded day by day. Therefore, many of the original spheres of influence of the Sterling Area were controlled by the US dollar, causing the local people to suffer the same brutal economic exploitation.

　　British Labour Government – That is, the current British cabinet. Because the current British government's cabinet is composed of the British Labour Party without the participation of other political parties, it is called the British Labour Government. The British Labour Party was founded in 1908 and is one of the two major political parties in Britain (the other being the Conservative Party). However, this Labour Party is not a true working-class party. Stalin once said: "It is not a working-class party, but a party of alliance of workers and urban petty bourgeoisie." Therefore, the British Labour Party has in reality become an appendage of the British capitalists and serves their interests, implementing some "reformist" domestic policies, still using its imperialist rule of thumb to carry out reactionary exploitation in the colonies, and blindly following the expansionist policies of US imperialism in foreign affairs. Because the British Labour Party has long implemented a retrograde policy that violates the interests of the working class, it has not only disappointed the broad masses of the British people, but also aroused dissatisfaction among the progressive elements in the party. Therefore, since 1931, many individual and group members have voluntarily withdrawn. This phenomenon has been increasing, and there have been famous "defection" incidents by Labour Party members of parliament. The current British Labour Party, represented by Attlee (Prime Minister) and Bevin (Foreign Secretary), etc., although the progressive forces within the party are growing, cannot yet change the ruling position of the right wing in the party, because the leaders of these reactionaries are entrenched in the leading organs of major trade unions and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. However, with the development of history, the policies of the British Labour Party will inevitably be gradually shattered by the awakened working class.

　　Yellow Trade Union – Before the First World War, the "International Federation of Trade Unions" under the leadership of the Second International violated Marxist theory, advocated compromise with the capitalists, and became the running dog of the bourgeoisie; therefore, in 1919, Lenin organized the Third International, which truly implemented Marxism. Since then, the Second International has been called the "Yellow International," and the International Federation of Trade Unions has been called the "Yellow Federation." The term "yellow trade union" comes from the Yellow Federation and refers to all reactionary trade unions that are controlled by capitalists and betray the interests of the working class.

　　Ton – is a unit of weight. There are two types: American tons and British tons. One US ton is equal to two thousand pounds, which is equivalent to 1814 Chinese jin; one British ton is equal to two thousand two hundred and forty pounds, which is equivalent to 2031 jin and eleven taels in Chinese weight.

　　International Trade – is the mutual transaction and sale between countries. This kind of transaction and sale is sometimes carried out freely, and sometimes it is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the commercial treaties and trade agreements concluded between the two countries. This kind of trade relationship should have been built on the basis of mutual exchange and mutual benefit that is beneficial to the people of all countries; however, the foreign trade of capitalist countries often violates this principle, always wants to monopolize the market, force other countries to reduce tariffs, or open up, in order to make money for themselves. Weaker countries inevitably suffer losses. In fact, the foreign trade of imperialist countries is carrying out economic aggression.

    英镑集团——英镑，是英国的本位货币名称；就如同银元是中国的本位货币名称一样。帝国主义的国家，因为要向外实行经济侵略，剥削与掠夺外国人民的财富，来满足自己国内大资本家的无穷欲望，所以就要强迫别的国家，使用帝国主义国家的货币；或者规定一种比率，使别国货币随着帝国主义国家货币涨落而涨落，失去独立性而成为帝国主义国家货币的附属品。这样，帝国主义国家的货币，就可以有很大的流通范围，到处可以投资做生意，控制市场，达到经济侵略的目的。英镑集团，就是在这样一种目的下，于一九三一年九月正式组成的。当时除了包括英帝国主义的各自治领、殖民地、旧国联委任英国统治地等地区以外，还有欧洲北部的挪威、瑞典、芬兰、丹麦，地中海西面的葡萄牙，非洲的埃及，南美洲的阿根廷等国家。那时，英帝国主义还曾经和日帝国主义竞争，要把中国划到英镑集团的范围里边去。但“九一八”以后，日帝国主义对中国的侵略当然是最残酷的。英镑劳力，远不如日元的劳力。第二次世界大战以后，英帝国主义劳力削弱，美帝国主义的侵略却日益扩张，所以许多原来是英镑集团的势力范围，都被美元所控制，使当地人民受到同样残酷的经济剥削。
    英国工党政府——即英国现内阁，因为现在的英政府的内阁，是英国工党所组成的，没有其他政党参加，所以称作英国工党政府。英国工党成立于一九零八年，为英国两大政党之一（另一为保守党），但这个工党，并不是一个真正工人阶级的政党，斯大林曾说过：“它不是一个工人阶级的政党，而是一个工人和城市的小资产阶级联盟的政党。”因此英国工党在实际上是变成了英国大资本家的附庸，并为其利益而服务，施行一些“改良主义”的内政，对殖民地仍然用其帝国主义的统治老套，进行反动的剥削，在外交上一味追随美帝国主义扩张政策之后，由于英国工党长期的实行违反工人阶级利益的倒退政策，不仅使广大的英国人民群众失望，同时也引起党内的进步分子不满，因此自从一九三一年以后，就有很多的个别和团体的党员，自动退出，此种现象，日益增加，且曾爆发有名的工党议员“叛党事件”。现在的英国工党以艾德礼（内阁总理），贝文（外长）等为代表，虽然党内的进步的力量正在生长着，但现在还不能改变党内右派统治地位，因为这些反动者的领袖，都盘踞各大职工会的领导机关和工党的全国执行委员会中。然而随着历史的发展，现在英国工党的政策，必将为觉醒的工人阶级逐渐击碎。
    黄色工会——在第一次世界大战以前，第二国际领导下的“国际劳动组合联盟”，违背了马克斯主义理论，主张与资本家妥协，成了资产阶级的走狗；所以一九一九年列宁又组织了真正实行马克斯主义的第三国际。从此，第二国际，被称为“黄色国际”，国际劳动组合联盟，被称为“黄色组合联盟”。黄色工会一语，就是从黄色组合联盟而来，也就是指的一切资本家御用的、出卖工人阶级利益的反动工会。
    吨——是计算重量的单位。有美国吨与英国吨两种，一美吨等于二千磅，合中国的市秤一千八百一十四斤；一英吨等于二千二百四十磅，合中国的市秤二千零三十一斤十一两。
    国际贸易——就是国家与国家之间，互相进行交易买卖。这种交易买卖，有时是自由进行的，有时是依照两国间所商订的通商条约、贸易协定等规定进行的。这种贸易关系，本来是应该建筑在互通有无、对各国人民都有利益的平等互惠基础上的；但是资本主义国家的对外贸易，常常违反这一原则，总是想垄断市场，强迫别国降低关税，或公开，以便自己赚钱，比它弱的国家必然吃亏，其实帝国主义国家的对外贸易，就是在实行经济侵略。
