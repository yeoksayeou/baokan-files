[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric] Since the end of the "seesaw battle," various counties under the Second Prefectural Committee have established training classes for village cadres, proposing that large-scale training must continue, attention should be paid to promoting cadres from within, organizations should be rectified, and preparations should be made to conclude land reform work. From November to the end of December before the New Year, the Prefectural Committee inspected and summarized the work of the training classes in various counties. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-four counties, including Yuncheng, Juancheng, and Yunbei (newly established county), a total of 1,941 village cadres and activists were trained, of which about two-thirds were Party members. In the training classes of various counties, current affairs, policies, and current work tasks were conveyed and discussed. Generally, the trainees overcame the "change of dynasty" mentality and felt that victory was certain. In the study of policies, they began to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, clarified their class viewpoints, and especially had a correct understanding of the lenient policy, realizing that only by fundamentally overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary regime could there be genuine peace. After training, every trainee improved ideologically. However, in mobilizing and reviewing trainees, although the targets were clarified beforehand, some district cadres did not mobilize deeply enough, and some villages sent rotating village chiefs (Xibei Second District) who were too old or too young to replace others in training. Even some villages sent landlords, rich peasants, and traitors to receive training (later reviewed and purged). In addition, some mobilization of Party members in Yuncheng was deceptive, causing them to be uneasy in their studies. Based on the experience of running training classes in the past, the following issues should still be noted when continuing to train village cadres and activists on a large scale in the future: (1) In the past training, less was said about the basic knowledge of the Party, and the ideological problems of Party members could not be better resolved. In the future, education on the Party's tasks, objectives, and brief history of struggle, the conditions for Party members, and the relationship between Party members and the masses should be strengthened. (2) Various counties should promote a large number of cadres from within to meet the current needs. (3) Grasp the key points (one group), learn from experience, and spread it in a timely manner. The ideological transformation of each stage must be well grasped.

　　冀鲁豫河南各县普训村干
  　准备进行结束土改
    【冀鲁豫电】二地委所属各县，自“拉锯战”结束后，各县成立了村干的训练班，提出必须继续大量训练，注意从中提拔干部，整顿组织并准备进行结束土改工作。从年前十一月至十二月底止，地委检查总结了各县训练班工作，据郓城、鄄城、郓北（新设县）等二十四个县不完全统计，共训练了村干部、积极分子一千九百四十一名，其中党员约占三分之二左右。各县训练班内，均进行了时事、政策、当前工作任务的传达与讨论，一般学员，均克服了变天思想，感到胜利是肯定了。在政策学习中，开始划清了敌我界限，明确了阶级观点，特别对宽大政策有了正确的认识，认识到只有根本打倒国民党反动政权，才有真正的和平。经过训练后，每个学员在思想上都有提高。但在动员与审查学员中，虽然事前明确了对象，但有些区干部动员不够深入，有的村将轮流村长（学北二区）年龄过大过小的送来顶替别人受训，更有的村竟把地富分子及汉奸分子送来受训（后来进行了审查清洗）。另外，在动员郓员上，有的带有欺骗性，致使其学习不安心。根据过去这一段办训练班的体验，今后为继续大量训练村干、积极分子时，仍应注意以下几个问题：（一）过去训练中对党的基本知识讲的较少，不能更好的解决党员的思想问题，今后要加强：共产党的任务、目的及奋斗简史、党员条件、党员和群众关系等教育。（二）各县应从中大量提拔干部，以适应目前的需要。（三）掌握重点（一个组），吸取经验及时传播。对每个思想转变环节要很好掌握。
