Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th. The Zheng Huang, Zheng Hong, Xiang Lan, and Xiang Hong Banners (equivalent to counties) in eastern Suiyuan, which suffered greatly under the Fu bandit army, have now re-established democratic autonomous governments and are actively engaged in reconstruction. As early as 1946, with the support of the Chinese Communist Party, the Mongol people of the above four banners established the first democratic autonomous government and organized Mongol armed forces to resist the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu bandit gangs. In September of the same year, after the Fu bandit army invaded eastern Suiyuan, the democratic government of the Mongol banners was destroyed. At that time, the Fu bandit army tore up Lama scriptures and used them as toilet paper in the Hongqi Great Temple in Jining County, turning the temple into a stable, desecrating the sacred place of the Mongol people. In Wuchuan, Taolin, and other places, the Fu bandit army robbed Mongol people of livestock and property, burned down their houses, creating "no-man's-lands," leaving the Mongol people displaced and homeless. Countless Mongol women were raped by the Fu bandit army. Last autumn, the People's Liberation Army liberated eastern Suiyuan again, and the Mongol people saw the light of day again. At the end of November last year, the Xiang Hong Banner convened a congress of Mongol people's representatives from various Sumus (equivalent to districts) and formally established a democratic autonomous government. The other three banners have also successively established democratic autonomous governments. Pan Di, the person in charge of the Zheng Huang Banner democratic government, said: "Only the Communist Party can truly help the Mongol people achieve liberation." The above four banner democratic governments are now leading the Mongol people in fifty-two Sumus to actively carry out various reconstruction tasks, and have organized people's armed forces to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits within their borders, so that the Mongol people can live and work in peace and contentment.

Another dispatch: The Jungar Banner Democratic Government of the Yikezhao League (a league is equivalent to a province) in southern Suiyuan is now working hard to develop national education in order to improve the cultural level of the Mongol people. In addition to the First Senior Primary School, which has already opened, more than 20 junior primary schools and winter schools have also been established in larger villages throughout the area. Jungar Banner is located at the junction of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan provinces. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu bandit gangs, there was not a single national school in the entire banner. Illiteracy accounted for 90 percent of the total population, and the vast number of Mongol youth and school-age children did not have the right to education.

　　绥东各蒙旗建立民主政府
  　领导蒙民积极建设
  　恢复被傅匪摧残的家园
    【新华社晋绥五日电】备受傅匪军摧残的绥远东部的正黄、正红、镶蓝、镶红等四蒙旗（相当于县），现已重新建立民主自治政府，积极进行恢复工作。早在一九四六年，上述四旗蒙民会在中国共产党扶助下，第一次建立了民主自治政府，并组织了蒙民武装，反抗蒋、傅匪帮的压迫。同年九月，傅匪军侵占绥东之后，蒙旗民主政府遂被摧毁。傅匪军当时在集宁县红旗大庙，曾撕毁喇嘛经书当便纸，把庙宇当马厩，亵渎蒙民的圣地。在武川、陶林等地，傅匪军抢去蒙民牲畜财宝，焚毁蒙民的房舍，制造“无人区”，使蒙民流离失所，无家可归。蒙族妇女受傅匪军奸淫者，不可计数。去年秋天，人民解放军再度解放绥东，蒙民方重见天日。镶红旗于去年十一月底召开了各苏木（相当于区）的蒙民代表大会，正式成立民主自治政府。其他三旗，亦先后成立了民主自治政府。正黄旗民主政府的负责人潘迪说：“只有共产党才能真正扶助蒙民获得解放。”上述四旗民主政府现正领导五十二个苏木的蒙民，积极进行各项恢复工作，并组织了人民武装，配合人民解放军清剿境内土匪，使蒙民得以安居乐业。
    又讯：绥远南部伊克昭盟（盟相当于省）的准噶尔旗民主政府，为了提高蒙民的文化水平，现正致力兴办国民教育。除第一高级小学现已开学外，各地较大村庄的初级小学和冬学，亦已成立二十余所。准噶尔旗位于晋陕绥三省交界，过去在蒋、傅匪帮的反动统治下，全旗没有一所国民学校，文盲占全人口的百分之九十，广大蒙旗青年与学龄儿童都没有享受教育的权利。
