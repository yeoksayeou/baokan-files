　　Bandit Fu's 104th Army Deputy Commander
  　Bandit Wang Xianzhang, Captured by Our Forces
  　The Story of His Capture
    [Reported by this newspaper] The fleeing enemy from Bandit Fu's 104th Army (formerly the Provisional 3rd Army), which was annihilated in the Kangzhuang pursuit battle, were captured by our local armed militias. Those identified so far include: Major General Deputy Army Commander Wang Xianzhang, Major General Chief of Staff Hao Qinfu, as well as Colonel Zhang Xin (scheduled to be appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the army), a training officer in the officer training team, Lieutenant Colonel Li Wenyun, Chief of the Second Section; Lieutenant Colonel Jiang Zhenhua, Secretary of the Political Work Department (scheduled to be appointed Deputy Director of the Political Work Department); Lieutenant Colonel Dong Tingfeng, Staff Officer of the Fourth Section; Lieutenant Colonel Gao Jinfu, Deputy Commander of the 749th Regiment of the 250th Division; Major Zhang Rongxiang, Political Work Director; and ten other general-level officers.

    When the Ping-Zhang Road was cut off by our powerful People's Liberation Army, and Beiping became critical, Bandit Fu hurriedly dispatched his core forces, the 35th and 104th Armies, from Huailai and Xinbao'an back to Beiping. After the plan for these two armies to coordinate and "converge" was shattered by our forces, bandit chief An Chunshan personally led the remnants of the 250th and 269th Divisions, attempting to detour to Nankou. After crossing the Mapaoquan River, their rearguard of two regiments was intercepted by us. Only the army headquarters, direct units, and part of the 269th Division remained, fleeing towards Baiyangcheng. Just as they reached Shuijian Village, they were surrounded by our pursuing troops. Under the impact of our intense artillery fire, the bandits were thrown into chaos. An Chunshan fled west alone with his adjutant and several guards, while the rest scattered like birds and beasts, fleeing for their lives. Deputy Army Commander Wang Xianzhang was abandoned, with only a guard, soldier Cao Zhikui, following him. They fled to Huer Yu, where they were captured by our militia. He changed his name to Wang Tingxian, falsely claiming to be a staff member with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army headquarters, serving in the Fuxu (comfort and support) Committee. Army Chief of Staff Hao Qinfu was left all alone. Later, he encountered two "comrades-in-arms" (soldiers) from the puppet "security police team." He ran towards the sound of gunfire, attempting to escape back to the bandit army, but was disarmed by the "comrades-in-arms" he was "leading" and escorted to our × village militia observation post. During registration, he "transformed" into Hao Liangzhong, a colonel and deputy chief of staff of the 104th Army. But this foolish deception was finally exposed by the people. Wang Xianzhang is 48 years old, from Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province, a middle school graduate, tall and slightly stout. He was wearing a cotton military uniform covered in mud. When first captured, he claimed to be a "comrade-in-arms," and has now been sent to the rear.

　　傅匪一○四军副军长
  　王匪宪章被我俘获
  　落网经过
    【本报讯】康庄追击战被歼之傅匪一○四军（原暂三军）溃散逃窜之敌，纷纷被我地武民兵捕捉落网。现已查明者计有：少将副军长王宪章、少将参谋长郝勤福及军官队上校队员张欣（拟调任该军副参谋长）、参二科中校科长李文蕴、政工处中校秘书蒋振华（拟调政工处副处长）、参四科中校参谋董廷枫、二五○师七四九团中校副团长高金福、少校政工主任张荣祥等将校级军官十名。
    当平张路被我强大人民解放军斩断，北平吃紧后，傅匪赶调其起家血本三十五及一○四军由怀来新保安回北平。该两军策应“会合”的计划在我打击下粉碎后，匪首安春山亲率二五○及二六九两个师的残部，妄图绕道窜南口，过马刨泉河后，就被我截去其后卫两个团，仅余军部、军直及二六九师之一部，向白阳城方向溃逃。刚到水涧村，即被我追击部队所包围。在我强烈炮火冲击下，匪徒慌乱一团。安春山独携副官、卫士数名，向西逃去，其余即作鸟兽散，各自亡命而逃。该副军长王宪章被遗弃，仅有看护军士曹志逵一人随后，逃至狐儿峪，被我民兵所俘，改名王廷贤，假报为军部中校附员，在抚恤委员会服务。该军参谋长郝勤福，只剩光杆一人，后遇伪“保警队”的两“战友”（即士兵），他跑向有枪声的地方，企图逃回匪军去，却被他所“率领”的“战友”下了枪，押送到我×村民兵了望所去。登记时“变”成了一○四军的上校副参谋长郝梁钟。但这种愚笨的隐瞒，终于被人民识破了。王宪章年四十八岁，绥远省丰镇县人，中学毕业，体高略胖，穿着一身染满泥垢的棉军装，初被俘时曾报“战友”，现已送后方。
