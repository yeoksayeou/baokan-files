[Taiyue Telegram] The Minyi Ironworks Cooperative in the Fourth District of Fushan is preparing to manufacture a large number of farm tools for use in this year's major production effort. The cooperative was established in June 1946 by Tang Changfa, Yang Congfu, Qiao Deshou, and others. Because it adopted methods such as free shareholding and withdrawal, periodic account settlement, and open accounting, it gained the support of general members and developed rapidly. Currently, the factory has two kilns and two furnaces, and the furniture and other items and raw materials are worth a total of 180,000 new currency units (hereinafter the same). After last autumn, it opened the furnace eight times, casting 2,500 plowshares and over 10,000 harrow teeth. It also produced 3,000 catties of finished goods such as basins and lamps. Recently, in preparation for this year's major production effort, in addition to the original seven workers engaged in sand turning and plowshare casting, 16 workers engaged in cargo and pot casting have been added. Last November, it also borrowed 10,000 yuan from the bank and 50 shi of grain, purchasing 60,000 catties of scrap iron in order to manufacture farm tools on a large scale. Currently, it uses 350 catties of wrought iron daily, producing 250 catties of finished goods. It has already cast 450 plowshares and over 250 pots. By the spring plowing season in March of this year, it can cast 5,000 plowshares, 2,500 sets of harrow teeth, 20 waterwheels, and 3,000 pots of various sizes. This will fulfill the task decided by the county production meeting of compensating for one-quarter of the county's original farm tools. There are also plans to set up an iron smelting furnace, using the hematite and limonite (with an iron content of over 60 percent) from the Houjiao and Qianjiao villages. The capital needed for iron smelting has been invested by various agencies and collective investment by the masses organized by cooperatives in various districts and villages.

　　前交民益铁炉大量制造农具
    【太岳电】浮山四区前交村民益铁炉合作社，准备制造大批农具供给今年大生产使用。该合作社是一九四六年六月由唐长发、杨从福、乔得寿等发起开办的。因为采用了自由入股、退股，按期结帐，帐目公开等办法，得到一般社员的拥护，发展很快。现在厂内有烤窑、火炉各两座，家具等件及原料共值新币（下同）十八万元。去年秋后曾开炉八次，铸出犁、铧二千五百张，耙齿一万多个。另有水盆、灯盏等成货三千斤。最近为了准备今年大生产，除原有翻沙、铸铧工人七人外，现又增加货物、铸锅工人十六名。去年十一月又向银行贷款一万元，贷粮五十石，收买废铁六万斤，以便大批制造农具。现在每天用毛铁三百五十斤，出成货二百五十斤。已铸铧四百五十张，铸锅二百五十多个，到今年三月春耕前，可铸铧五千张，耙齿二千五百付，水车二十辆，大小锅三千个。能完成县生产会议决定的补偿全县原有农具四分之一的任务。现又计划设一炼铁炉，用后交、前交村一带的赤铁矿、褐铁矿（含铁成分都在百分之六十以上），炼铁缺少的资本已由各机关投资及各区、村合作社组织群众集体投资。
