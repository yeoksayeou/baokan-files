[Beiyue News] The Ciyu Town market in Lingshou County has adjusted its brokers, leading to market prosperity and increased tax revenue. During the land redistribution period, the town replaced many skilled brokers with poor and landless peasants, intending to allow them to share dividends each market day and alleviate their families' difficulties. However, most of them were illiterate and innumerate, relying solely on verbal agreements for transactions. They passively received dividends, resulting in sloppily written transaction certificates. When settling accounts at the tax office, they couldn't even understand the invoices and payments. Furthermore, unscrupulous verbal brokers engaged in tax evasion, causing considerable chaos in market transactions. To address this, the County Management Committee decided to adjust the brokers, holding an examination for brokers in the surrounding villages. Twenty-seven people from twenty-two villages participated, with the selection criteria being literacy, numeracy, ability to serve the market, and popular support from the masses. As a result, ten candidates were selected, four were designated as alternates, and thirteen were removed. Two accountants were added to each trade. In addition, various meeting and reporting systems and market regulations were established. It was stipulated that brokers should actively combat verbal brokers, refrain from touching hands (for bribes), conduct transactions patiently, negotiate prices face-to-face, register transactions with three people present, and be responsible for compensating any losses of goods brought to the market. Previously, each broker received a dividend of 25 new currency units per market day. After the adjustment, each person receives 35 new currency units per market day, increasing the total by 800 new currency units per market day. The previous problems of unclear accounts and market chaos have been eliminated, and the brokers are in high spirits, with merchants and residents finding it convenient. Tax revenue increased from over 28,400 new currency units in October last year to over 52,000 new currency units in November.

　　慈峪镇调整成交员商民称便税收增加
    【北岳讯】灵寿慈峪镇市场调整成交员，市场繁荣，税收增加。该镇在土地平分时期，曾把不少有技术的成交员换成贫雇农，目的是让他们每集分红，解决家中困难。但他们绝大部分不会写不会算，只靠黑名牙纪成交，他们坐分红利，结果交易证写的马马虎虎，到税务所里算帐，票照款都弄不清；甚至黑名牙纪从中捣鬼，偷税的很多，弄得市场交易相当混乱。为此，县管理委员会特决定调整成交员，在周围有关村庄举行成交员的考试。参加者二十二个村二十七人，录取条件为能写会算，能为市场服务，为群众所拥护。结果考取十名，候补四名，洗刷了十三名。各行并添设会计两名。此外又建立了各种会议汇报制度及市场规矩。规定成交员要主动反黑名牙纪，不摸手，耐心成交，当面讲价钱，三人对面登记，上市货物一点不让损失，损失东西负责赔偿等。成交员以前每人每集分红新币二十五元，调整后每人每集分三十五元。每集共增加八百元。过去帐目不清，市场混乱等现象已扫除，成交员情绪很高，商民称便。税收款去年十月份的二万八千四百余元，十一月份增加到五万二千余元。
