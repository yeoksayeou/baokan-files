[Jizhong Telegram] The Women's Federation of the Jizhong District convened a meeting of county and district cadres from Raoyang, Shenxian, Anping, Wuqiang, and Xianxian counties on January 3 to discuss the women's movement work over the past three months of winter. The materials discussed revealed that women in various counties played a significant role in the work of the past three winter months, demonstrating the great strength of the broad masses of rural women.

In concluding the land reform, some counties paid attention to promoting the organizational strength of women, uniting and mobilizing poor and middle-peasant women to actively participate. According to incomplete statistics, Shenxian County had 886 women cadres in 159 villages. Statistics from six key villages in five counties showed that more than 1,040 women participated in concluding land reform. At the same time, various counties paid attention to conducting propaganda and education through women's associations and literacy classes to implement policies, explaining the significance of the final determination of land rights and the issuance of land certificates for women's liberation, and enlightening the broad masses of women. For example, in Nanjie, Shenxian County, women cadres broadcast from rooftops in three groups every night and went to households for propaganda during the day. An old woman said, "In the past, women couldn't even get their hands on paper and ink, but now they also have a share of the land!" A woman who ran a small business heard about the issuance of land certificates and temporarily stopped her business to attend the meeting. In Yanggezhuang, a flood-stricken village in the fifth district of Anxin, women initially refused to attend the winter school when it was announced, but when they were told that the issuance of land certificates at the end of land reform meant women would have a share, more than 280 women attended the first night. Women who could write and calculate participated in filling out and issuing land certificates, while those who could not write and calculate engaged in land measurement. An old woman of 53 measured 52 mu of land in the low-lying areas. In the urban district, women alone resolved more than 20 dispute cases in seven villages. In Nanxusima, Raoyang, when the men went to support the front, more than 200 women went down to the low-lying areas to measure the land. When women in Dongguanli, Wuqiang, measured the land and could not write, they drew on the paper, horizontal lines and vertical lines, and then asked those who could calculate to help them. In Nanmiaotou, the ninth district of Anping, when dividing floating wealth, male cadres said that women could not handle affairs and did not allow women to participate, but the women insisted on participating and worked even harder. They corrected the encroachment on middle-peasant elements and made appropriate compensation, distributed the floating wealth well, and organized 136 households of women to participate in women's organizations.

In supporting the front lines, especially after the start of the Pingjin Campaign, most women in various counties actively participated in grinding rice, milling flour, helping with work for those on duty, and making military shoes and socks. When the men went to support the front, the women took on the great task of concluding land reform. In Guoqiantun, the tenth district of Shenxian County, 43 women ground 30,000 jin of millet in one day and one night. Chen Shufang, the director of the women's association in Xiaoliyu Village, the ninth district, ground rice with her child in her arms and constantly mobilized others. In helping the working people on duty, according to statistics from two districts in Shenxian, they made 46 cotton-padded clothes, 95 pairs of shoes, 78 pairs of socks, two sets of single clothes, and also disassembled and washed many others. Women cadres in Daguanting Women's Association in Raoyang often helped families of those on duty fetch water. According to statistics from eight districts in Raoyang, women made 587,000 military uniforms. Women in Xiliman and other areas also constantly helped hospitals wash clothes. In Xianxian County, 12 villages made 30,000 pairs of socks and 23,800 sets of military uniforms. In Anping, two districts (the ninth and first districts) made 700 quilts, 36,000 sets of winter clothing, 130,000 sets of spring clothing, 2,300 overcoats, and disassembled and washed 300 sets in 20 days. Li Gengchang in the urban area of Shenxian County was unwilling to be on duty, but his wife mobilized him to do so.

In winter production, after production education and organization for women, they generally actively participated in spinning, boiling saltpeter, leaching salt, weaving sock bottoms, opening small shops, selling baked cakes, and other activities. In Raoyang County, 153 villages had 16,566 spinning wheels regularly spinning thread, with each wheel spinning at least one jin per market day. In the first, second, and third districts of Anping, there were 42 sock bottom weaving groups, of which seven groups persisted for seven or eight years without disbanding, relying on weaving sock bottoms to solve their livelihood problems. Women in the cities and towns of Wuqiang, Raoyang, and Xianxian counties actively scraped saltpeter every day from morning till night. A village in Raoyang has learned to use the new-style spinning machine, which spins more than three jin more per market day than the spinning wheel. A family of nine in Dongyin Village can maintain the livelihood of the whole family by relying on one spinning machine. Because women have played a significant role in concluding land reform and supporting the front-line production, their social status has greatly improved. Many people who used to underestimate women now say that women can do things just as well, changing their feudal viewpoints.

    【冀中电】冀中区妇联会，于一月三号召开了饶阳、深县、安平、武强、献县五个县的县区干部会，座谈冬三个月的妇运工作。从谈出的材料中，看出各县妇女在冬三月工作中起了很大作用。显示了广大农村妇女的伟大力量。
    在结束土改上，有的县注意了推动妇女的组织力量，团结发动中贫农妇女积极参加，据不完全统计，深县一百五十九个村有八百八十六个妇女干部。五个县六个重点村的统计，有一千零四十多妇女参加了结束土改。同时各县注意了通过妇女会，识字班，进行宣传教育，贯彻政策，说明最后确定地权，发土地证对妇女解放的意义，启发教育了广大妇女。如深县南街妇女干部每天晚上分三片在房上广播，白天到各户去进行宣传。一个老太太说：“过去妇女们可上不了纸墨，这回也有一份地啊！”一个做小买卖的妇女一听说发土地证，买卖暂时不做也要去开会。安新五区水灾村杨各庄开始说成立冬校，妇女们不去；后说结束土改，发土地证有妇女的一份，头一晚上就有二百八十多个妇女参加了。在登记丈量填发土地证时，能写算的妇女参加了填发工作，不会写算的搞丈量。一个五十三岁的老太太下洼量地五十二亩。城市区七个村光妇女单独解决纠纷问题二十多件。饶阳南许司马男的去支前，二百多妇女下洼去量地。武强东关里妇女量地时不会写，便在纸上划，横划横道，长划直道，回来叫会算的帮助算。安平九区南庙头分浮财时，男干部说妇女办不了事，不准妇女参加，妇女们非参加不可，工作中并且干的更欢，把侵犯的中农成份改正过来，并适当的补偿了，浮财也分配好了，还组织了一百三十六户的妇女参加妇女组织。
    在支前工作上，尤其是平津战役开始，各县大部分妇女都积极参加了碾米、磨面、给出勤的作活、作军鞋军袜。男的支前走了，妇女们便担当了结束土改的伟大任务。深县十区郭前屯四十三个妇女一天一宿碾了三万斤小米，九区小里鱼村妇女主任陈书芳抱着孩子碾，还不断的去动员别人。在帮助出勤的民工作活上，据深县二个区统计，做棉衣四十六件，鞋九十五双，袜子七十八双，单衣两身，其他拆洗的还很多。饶阳大官亭妇会干部经常帮助出勤户家中挑水。饶阳八个区的统计，妇女作军衣五十八万七千件，西里满一带的妇女还不断的帮助医院洗衣服。献县十二个村作袜子三万双，军装二万三千八百套。安平二个区（九区、一区）二十天作被子七百床，冬装三万六千套，春装十三万套，大衣二千三百件，拆洗三百套。深县城区李根长不愿出勤，他媳妇动员他出了勤。
    在冬季生产上，经过了对妇女的生产教育和组织，一般都积极参加了纺织，熬硝、淋盐、织罗底、开小铺、卖火烧等。饶阳全县一百五十三个村，有一万六千五百六十六辆纺车经常纺线，每集每辆最低纺一斤。安平一、二、三区有四十二个织罗底组，其中有七个组坚持了七、八年，没有散，依靠织罗底解决了生活问题。武强、饶阳、献县等县城里妇女，每天都是没黑到白的积极刮硝。饶阳有个村已经学会了使用新式纺纱机，比纺线车每集多纺三斤多。东尹村一户九口人依靠一个纺纱机能维持全家生活。由于妇女们在结束土改与支前生产中都起了巨大作用，所以她们的社会地位现已大大提高。许多从前轻视妇女的人，都说妇女一样能办事，改变了他们的封建观点。
