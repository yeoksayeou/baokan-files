　　【Jinan Telegram】 Guangping's change from labor conscription to employed transport has achieved initial success. The masses are voluntarily requesting to provide transport services. The county suffered severe water and insect disasters last year. Most villages lacked grass after the start of winter, and livestock owners felt it was difficult to raise animals. Many households were considering selling their cattle and donkeys. The county committee believed that failure to help the masses solve this difficulty would be detrimental to large-scale production. Therefore, it was decided to change from dispatching labor conscription to employing transport, in order to increase the income of livestock owners. The Third District first experimented with employing transport for the 72,700 jin of grain to be transported to Handan, and it was successfully completed. According to the previous labor conscription method, each cart carried 1,000 jin, requiring 73 carts and four days round trip. Each cart required 112 jin of food for people and animals, totaling 3,706,000 Jibi currency. This time, changing to employed transport used only 50 large carts (including six single-ox carts). Each cart loaded 1,450 jin to 2,150 jin, and the public only paid 2,501,500 Jibi currency in transportation fees, saving 1,244,500 Jibi currency compared to labor conscription. It also saved 208 man-days and 208 animal-days. And the livestock owners also obtained considerable profits: each cart, after deducting the cost of people and animals, still earned more than 73,000 Jibi currency, which was much better than receiving 28 jin of rice per day in the past. They could also carry other goods on the return trip, so the livestock owners were very happy and requested to transport again in the future. At the same time, it dispelled the worries of each livestock owner of "cattle being idle in winter, only dispatching labor but not using them," and stopped the phenomenon of selling cattle.

　　广来改支差为雇运公家省钱群众高兴
    【冀南电】广平改支差为雇运，初试成功。群众自动要求运输。该县去年曾遭严重水、虫灾害，大部村庄入冬后缺草，畜主觉着养牲口困难，不少户想着卖牛卖驴。县委会认为如不帮助群众解决这一困难，将于大生产不利。故决定改派差为雇运，以增加畜主收入，三区首先将运至邯郸的七万二千七百斤粮试办雇运，顺利完成。按以往支差办法，每辆车装一千斤，需七十三辆车来回四天。每车人畜口粮一百十二斤，共折冀钞三百七十万六千元。这次改为雇运，只用了五十辆大车（内六辆独牛），每车装到一千四百五十斤至二千一百五十斤，公家只出运费二百五十万一千五百元，比支差少出一百廿四万四千五百元。并省人工二百零八个，牲口工二百零八个。而畜主也获得很大利润：每辆车除人畜费用外，尚得七万三千多元，比过去每天发二十八斤米的口粮强得多。回来时又能捎运其他货物，所以畜主非常高兴，纷纷要求以后再运。同时解除了每户畜主的“冬天牛闲，自己不使光出差”的顾虑，停止了卖牛现象。
