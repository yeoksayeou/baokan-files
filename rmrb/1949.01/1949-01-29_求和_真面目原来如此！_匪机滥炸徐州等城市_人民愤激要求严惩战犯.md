　　The True Face of "Seeking Peace" Revealed!
　　Bandit Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Xuzhou and Other Cities
　　The People are Outraged and Demand Severe Punishment for War Criminals
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th】 Recently, Kuomintang bandit planes have continuously and indiscriminately bombed liberated areas such as Jinan, Xuzhou, Langfang, and Suixikou. They also scattered "seeking peace" leaflets during the bombings, revealing the true face of the war criminals' so-called peace. The day after indiscriminately bombing Jinan, Kuomintang bandit planes indiscriminately bombed Xuzhou. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, six bandit planes invaded the airspace of Xuzhou, continuously bombing for two hours, dropping a total of 55 bombs, killing 29 residents, injuring 6, and destroying more than 200 houses. Prior to this, Kuomintang bandit planes had bombed the famous town of Suixikou in northern Anhui province on the 6th, scattering a large number of "seeking peace" leaflets during the bombing. On the afternoon of the 9th, two Kuomintang bandit planes bombed Langfang, between Tianjin and Beijing, killing 30 people who were attending the market and injuring 28. The shameless behavior of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who on the one hand clamor for "peace" and on the other hand continuously and indiscriminately bomb the liberated areas, has aroused great anger among the people in various regions. The citizens of Xuzhou, after being bombed, said indignantly: This is the "peace" of war criminals Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke! The citizens of Suixikou said passionately: Peace is absolutely impossible without severely punishing these war criminals!

    【新华社陕北二十七日电】国民党匪机最近连续滥炸解放区济南、徐州、廊房、睢溪口等城市，并在轰炸中散发“求和”传单，表明了战犯们所谓和平的真面目。国民党匪机在滥炸济南市的次日滥炸徐州市。十三日上午十一时，匪机六架侵入徐州市空，连续轰炸达两小时，共投弹五十五枚，炸死居民二十九人，伤六人，毁房二百余间。在此以前，国民党匪机曾在六日轰炸安徽北部宿县的著名市镇睢溪口，轰炸时并大量散发“求和”传单。九日下午，国民党匪机两架曾轰炸平津间的廊房，炸死赶集的人民三十人，伤二十八人，国民党反动集团一面嚣叫“和平”，一面对解放区连续滥炸的无耻行为，引起了各地人民的极大愤怒。被炸后的徐州市民愤慨地说：这就是战犯蒋介石、李宗仁、孙科的“和平”！睢溪口的市民激昂地说：不严厉惩办这些战争罪犯，绝对不能讲和平！
