Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Reports from various sources: The huge 1949 French fiscal budget案, amounting to 1,865 billion francs, after no less than twelve debates in the National Assembly dominated by reactionaries, was finally passed on the 24th. French Communist Party deputies firmly opposed the passage of this bill. In this enormous budget, which is twice as large as the 1948 budget, according to Agence France-Presse: economic expenditures total 1,281 billion francs, of which so-called civil expenditures account for 750 billion francs, military expenditures account for 350 billion francs, and national equipment maintenance costs account for 150 billion francs. The special budget, accounting for one-third of the total budget, is 615 billion francs. This budget案, which breaks the French historical record, is a budget案 prepared to carry out a great plunder of the French people. According to Agence France-Presse, this budget will be paid for by 1,400 billion francs in new taxes, 100 billion francs in public debt, and 280 billion francs in dollar loans. The method of collecting new taxes will be based on the so-called "financial reform" principles issued by the French government on November 29th. The Telecommunications Agency pointed out: "The actual effect of this 'reform' is to increase the burden on workers and the middle class, which is particularly evident from the abolition of the principle of tax exemption for those with the lowest wages. The past exemption level was already lower than the minimum necessary income for artisans, small shopkeepers, and farmers, and these people are particularly harmed by this exemption." To cope with this huge budget, the National Assembly also passed a decision to increase the production tax by 20 percent.
During the debates in the National Assembly, François revealed that actual military expenditures were much larger than 350 billion. Mendès France, a fiscal expert from the Radical Socialist Party, former Minister of Finance, and current French representative to the World Bank, denounced the military budget as false in the debate. France said that the promise of Socialist Minister of Defense Ramadier to limit the military budget to 350 billion francs was completely unfounded empty talk. France emphasized that the heavy military expenses were placed under other names with a hidden face. He cited the maintenance costs of airports and naval base equipment as examples. These two expenses were disguised as civilian aviation and civilian port expenses allocated to the Ministry of Public Works. Similarly, the maintenance costs of colonial airports and war equipment are placed in the Overseas Department. The expenses of the Gendarmerie and the Republican Security Force will be included in the Ministry of the Interior, although these forces are purely military in nature. France said: The real military expenditure in the new budget's recurring expenses will reach 500 billion francs, not 350 billion francs, accounting for a huge percentage of 40% in the entire 1949 budget.

### 法议会通过庞大预算　法共议员坚表反对

　　法议会通过庞大预算
  　法共议员坚表反对
    【新华社陕北三十日电】各方报导：数达一万八千六百五十亿法郎的一九四九年度法国的庞大财政预算案，在反动派占优势的国民议会中，经过不下十二次的辩论以后，已于二十四日获得通过。法共议员坚决反对通过这一议案。在这一比一九四八年度大两倍的巨大预算中，据法新社称：经济费用共占一万二千八百一十亿法郎，就中所谓民事开支费用占七千五百亿法郎，军事费占三千五百亿法郎，国家设备维持费占一千五百亿法郎。占全部预算三分之一的特别预算为六千一百五十亿法郎。这一打破法国历史纪录的预算案，是准备对法国人民施行大掠夺的预算案。据法新社报导，此项预算将以一万四千亿法郎新税、一千亿法郎公债及二千八百亿法郎美元贷款等办法支付。关于征收新税办法，将根据法政府十一月二十九日颁发的所谓“财政改革”的原则。电通社指出：“这种‘改革’的实际效果，就是增加工人和中产阶级的负担，这由废除最低薪资所得者免征原则一事特别可以看出。过去的免征水平本来就已低于工匠、小店主和农民的必须最低收入，这些人特别受这个免征之害。”为了应付这一庞大的预算，国民议会还通过了增加生产税百分之二十的决定。
    在国民议会的辩论中，法郎斯揭露了实际上的军事费用比三千五百亿还大得多。急进社会党的财政专家、前财政部长、现任世界银行法国代表的门德·法郎斯，在辩论中斥责军费预算是假的。法郎斯说，社会党的国防部长拉马第，把军费预算限制为三千五百亿法郎的诺言完全是没有根据的空话。法郎斯强调沉重的军费是以隐蔽的面目被置于其他名目之下。他举出机场和海军基地设备的维持费为例，这两笔费用是被伪装在拨归公共工程部充民用航空和民用港口费用的面目下的。同样，殖民地的机场与战争设备的维持费，则放在海外部。宪兵与共和国保安队的费用，将被列入内政部，虽然这些武力是纯粹军事性质的。法郎斯称：新预算经常费用中真正的军费数字，将达五千亿法郎，而不是三千五百亿法郎，在一九四九年全部预算中，占百分之四十的巨大百分比。
