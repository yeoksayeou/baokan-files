To the Editor:

　　Recently, while studying the rectification documents, I came across the section on "Opposing Several Incorrect Tendencies within the Party" in the article "On Extreme Democratization." After discussing it with comrades, I still haven't been able to fully resolve several questions. I would appreciate it if you could provide answers. The main questions are:

　　(1) What is the difference between "democratic centralism" and "democratic authoritarianism"? (2) What kind of system is "bottom-up democratic authoritarianism"? Why is it wrong? What is the difference between it and the mass line approach in the work of leaders? (3) Why is it wrong to "first submit instructions from higher levels to lower levels for discussion, and then make a resolution"? What is the difference between it and the mass line approach in the work of leaders? What is the difference between it and the "military democracy" practiced in the army today? (4) Regarding "the minority submits to the majority, and the lower level submits to the higher level," someone explained: "If the opinions of the majority and the higher level are wrong, then the minority and the lower level can reserve their own opinions, but they must abide by the resolutions of the higher level and the majority." Is this statement correct? Why should different opinions be reserved when in a lower position and in the minority? In addition, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "… bravely uphold the truth, tell others the truth, and fight for the truth. Even if it is temporarily unfavorable to him to do so, he must withstand all kinds of blows and even opposition and accusations from the majority in order to uphold the truth, leaving him temporarily isolated (glorious isolation). Even if it requires sacrificing one's own life, he can go against the tide to uphold the truth and never drift with the current." Then, if it is clearly known that the resolutions of the higher level and the majority are wrong, but it is still necessary to act because they are the resolutions of the higher level and the majority, isn't this "drifting with the current"?

　　(1) The terms "democratic centralism" and "democratic authoritarianism" are the same. "Democratic authoritarianism" was used in the past, but now "democratic centralism" is commonly used.

　　(2) "Bottom-up democratic authoritarianism" means "first submitting it to the lower level for discussion, and then making a resolution by the higher level." This is an erroneous tendency in the Red Army party organization that Chairman Mao criticized in 1929. It is different from the mass line approach of leading organs. The mass line approach means that leading organs must first understand the situation of lower-level organs and the lives of the masses, and then formulate guiding principles based on these situations to guide lower-level organs and the masses. However, there are many ways to understand the situation below, and it is not necessary to always submit it to the lower level for discussion (of course, it is also possible for higher-level organs to propose questions and first submit them to the lower level to collect materials, conduct research and discussion, and formulate preliminary plans, and then submit them to the higher level for approval and implementation). But it should not be made a system. If everything must be submitted to the lower level for discussion before the higher level can make a resolution, then what combat effectiveness can the Party have? "First submitting it to the lower level for discussion, and then making a resolution by the higher level" is a tendency toward extreme democratization. Chairman Mao said in the article "Opposing Several Incorrect Tendencies within the Party" that "the execution of resolutions often shows a reluctant attitude," which is the inevitable result of this tendency. This tendency must be overcome to ensure the correct implementation of the Party's democratic centralism, ensure the Party's high degree of centralization and unity, and overcome anarchism and lack of discipline.

　　(3) Your interpretation of "the minority submits to the majority, and the lower level submits to the higher level" is correct. Communists must adhere to the truth at all times and in all places. If they clearly know it is the truth but cannot adhere to it, then there is no loyalty to the revolutionary cause, no principle, and a vulgar, philistine attitude of drifting with the current. This is one aspect of the matter. Another aspect of the matter is that it is necessary to obey the organization and abide by the decisions of the higher level and the majority, even if you make a decision that is wrong. Why should you obey if you think it is wrong? Because it is not certain whether the decisions of the higher level and the majority are wrong, and it must be judged by the higher-level party committee or the central government. Before the higher level changes the decision, the organization must obey. If any party member believes that the organization's decision is wrong and does not obey or implement it, then the Party's organization will become independent, disorganized, and completely lose its combat effectiveness. Moreover, even if the higher level and the majority are truly wrong, the organization should not be destroyed or cause division, but rather patiently persuade the higher level and the majority to implement their own correct opinions. To carry out a revolution, there must be a revolutionary organization. Without an organization, the revolution cannot be carried out. Therefore, splitting the organization and destroying the organization is a major principled error.

### “由下而上的民主集权制”是怎样一种制度？为什么不对？

　　“由下而上的民主集权制”是怎样一种制度？为什么不对？编辑同志：
    最近我在学习整风文件上，看到“反对党内几种不正确的倾向”一文中，关于“极端民主化”问题的部分，有几个问题虽经和同志们交谈，亦未得到透澈的解决，请予以答复。主要几个问题是：
    （一）“民主集中制”和“民主集权制”有何区别？（二）“由下而上的民主集集权制”是怎样一种制度？为什么不对？它和领导者在工作中走群众路线有何区别？（三）接到上级指示后“先交下级讨论，再做决议”为什么不对？它和领导者在工作中走群众路线有何不同？它和今天军队中实行的“军事民主”又有何区别？（四）关于“少数服从多数，下级服从上级”有人解释说：“多数人和上级的意见有错误，那么少数人和下级可以保留自己的意见，但必须遵照上级和多数人的决议去做”，这种说法是否对？处在下级和少数的情况下有不同的意见时为何保留？另外，刘少奇同志说：“………勇敢的拥护真理，告诉别人以真理，为真理而战斗。即使他这样作暂时于他不利，为了拥护真理而要受到各种打击，甚至受到大多数人的反对与指责，而使他暂时孤立（光荣的孤立）。甚至因此而要牺牲自己的生命，他也能够逆潮流而拥护真理，绝不随波逐流”。那么，明明知道上级和大多数的决议是错误的，而却因为是上级和大多数的决议则必须来做。这是不是“随波逐流”呢？

    （一）“民主集中制”和“民主集权制”这两个名词是一样的，过去曾用过“民主集权制”，现在则通用“民主集中制”。
    （二）“由下而上的民主集权制”就是“先交下级讨论、再由上级决议”，这是毛主席在一九二九年所批判过的红军党组织中的一种错误倾向。它和领导机关走群众路线是不同的。走群众路线就是说领导机关要先明了下级机关的情况和群众生活的情况，然后根据这些情况规定指导方针去指导下级机关和群众。但要明了下面的情况办法很多，不必一定先交下级讨论（有时上级机关提出问题先交下级收集材料，研究讨论，拟定初步方案，交上级批准实行，当然也是可以的。），更不应订成制度。凡事必须先交下级讨论，上级才能决议，那样，党还能有什么战斗力呢？“先交下级讨论，再由上级决议”，是一种极端民主化的倾向，毛主席在“反对党内几种不正确倾向”的文章中所说“决议案之执行往往表示勉强态度”，就是这种倾向的必然结果。必须克服这种倾向，才能保证党的民主集中制的正确实行，保证党的高度集中与统一，克服无政府无纪律现象。
    （三）你所引的对于“少数服从多数，下级服从上级”的解释是对的。共产党人无论何时何地都要坚持真理，如果自己明明知道是真理而又不能坚持，那就谈不到对于革命事业的忠诚，那就是没有原则性，那就是庸俗的市侩随波逐流的态度。这是事情的一方面。事情的另一方面就是必须服从组织，必须遵照上级和大多数的决定来作，虽然你做出这决定是错的。为什么自己既然认为错误还要服从呢？因为究竟上级和大多数的决定是否错误还不一定，还要等高级党委或中央来判明。当上级未改变决定之前组织上还得服从。如果任何一个党员认为组织的决定错了就不服从，就不执行，那党的组织就会成为各行其是的，涣散的，完全失去战斗的能力。而且即使上级和多数真正错了，也不应破坏组织，引起分裂，而是要耐心去说服上级和大多数去执行自己认为正确的意见。要进行革命必须有革命组织，没有组织就不能进行革命。因此，分裂组织破坏组织是重大的原则错误。
