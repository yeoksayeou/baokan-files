　　Public Utilities Recover Quickly
  　Military Control Commission Takes Over China Merchants Bureau, Preparing for Navigation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] Within two or three days of the liberation of Tianjin, public utilities vital to the lives of two million people, including electricity, telephone, tram, water, and postal services, had been initially restored. The rapid recovery of electricity supply played a significant role. The Tianjin branch of the Hebei Electric Power Company mainly supplied electricity to Tianjin. The enemy severely damaged various lines of the company. Immediately after the liberation of Tianjin, 120 workers and more than ten engineers from the company immediately went out to repair the damaged lines. By the second day after liberation, the repairs were completed, and power was restored. Many factories, schools, institutions, and streetlights along the roads were relit. Other enterprises, such as trams, telephones, and waterworks, also resumed work quickly due to the electricity supply. The Tianjin Waterworks resumed normal water supply on the day of liberation. The Ji'an Water Company is also actively under repair. Some of the tram lines damaged by the enemy have been repaired by workers, and the first batch of 24 trams was put into operation on the 17th. On the same day, all telephone services in the city were restored. The post office resumed business at noon on that day and began postal services with Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and other places. Stamps with Chairman Mao's image appeared before the citizens for the first time. Most of the public bus and railway employees in the city have resumed work and are actively preparing for traffic. The Kuomintang's state-owned China Merchants Bureau has been taken over by the Military Control Commission, which has sent personnel to take over and is planning to open navigation to the outside world. The rapid takeover and recovery of various public utilities in the city demonstrate the people's outstanding ability to manage large cities. On the 15th, as soon as the fighting ended, the People's Liberation Army soldiers stood guard at the entrances of the aforementioned companies and factories to protect them and strictly prohibited any destruction. At the same time, the Military Control Commission immediately sent military representatives to the companies and factories to carry out the takeover systematically and orderly. The vast majority of employees, who had long yearned for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army under the long-term oppression of the enemy and puppets, reported to work and immediately resumed work on the day after liberation, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of employees.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] During the operations in the suburbs of Tianjin, a unit of the People's Liberation Army joined hands with workers to bravely protect the North China's largest paper mill, Hua Yi Paper Mill, under the artillery fire of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. On the 5th of this month, when a unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated the enemy in Huidui, south of Tianjin, they sent people into the Hua Yi Paper Mill, risking enemy fire, to cooperate with the workers in sealing all the factory's warehouses and sending out sentries to guard them. At the height of the battle, worker Li Chunlin remained at his post, guarding Water Tower No. 3, and did not leave his post even though his right arm was injured. After the enemy guarding Huidui was annihilated, the People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately began to remove the hundred or so landmines buried around the paper mill by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Some soldiers picked up the paper that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had looted from the trenches and handed it over to the higher authorities. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Tianjin city bombarded the paper mill with howitzers and heavy artillery. All 297 employees of the factory, regardless of their personal safety, automatically stayed in the factory to disassemble and preserve important parts and covered the sulfur and gasoline in the warehouses with cement and sacks filled with soil, finally protecting these materials from being destroyed by artillery fire. When the roof of Machine Room No. 3 caught fire after being hit by an enemy shell, forty or fifty workers from the factory, regardless of the enemy's artillery fire that had not yet stopped, immediately climbed onto the roof and quickly put out the fire. The employees worked day and night to protect the factory until the Tianjin defenders were completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. The factory was formerly under the North China Paper Industry Company, which belonged to the National Resources Commission of the Kuomintang. It usually had more than a thousand employees and produced 60 tons of paper per day.

　　公用事业迅速恢复
  　军管会已接收招商局准备通航
    【新华社天津二十五日电】天津市解放后的二三天内，关系二百万人民生活的全市电灯、电话、电车、自来水、邮政等公用事业即告初步恢复。其中电力供应的迅速恢复起着重大的作用，天津市用电主要由冀北电力公司天津分公司供应。该公司的各处线路，被敌破坏甚多。天津甫告解放，该公司一百二十个工人和十多个工程师立即出动抢修被毁各线路，至解放后第二日，即抢修完竣，恢复送电。许多工厂、学校、机关及马路上的路灯，均重放光明。其他如电车、电话、自来水等企业亦因获得电力供应而迅速复工。天津自来水厂解放后当日即照常供水。济安自来水公司，也在积极修复中。被敌破坏的电车线路，一部分已为工人修理完竣，首批电车二十四辆已于十七日出厂。同日，全市电话也全部恢复通话。邮政局于是日中午起恢复营业，并与沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、张家口、石家庄、济南、徐州、开封等地开始通邮。印有毛主席像的邮票，首次出现在市民面前。市内公共汽车及铁路员工已大部复工，正积极准备通车。国民党公营的招商局，已由军管会派员接收，正计划向外通航。该市各公用事业的接收与恢复工作的迅速，显示了人民管理大城市的卓越能力。十五日战斗方告结束，解放军战士们即在上述各公司工厂门首，站岗保护，严禁任何破坏。同时，军管会立即派军事代表迅速到达各公司工厂，有系统、有秩序地进行接收。绝大部分员工，在敌伪长期压榨下，久已渴望解放军的到来，故在解放的次日，仅电话公司、自来水厂报到并立即复工的职工，即占原有职工总数百分之八十以上。
    【新华社天津廿五日电】天津近郊作战中，解放军某部与工人携手，在蒋匪炮火下，英勇地保护了华北第一大造纸厂——华一造纸厂。本月五日，解放军某部歼灭天津以南灰堆子的敌人时，即派人进入华一造纸厂，冒着敌人的炮火，协同工人将工厂所有仓库都贴上封条，并派出岗哨看管。在战斗最激烈的时候，工友李春林仍坚持岗位，看守三号水塔，虽右臂受伤，也不离开岗位。灰堆子守敌被歼后，解放军战士即动手把蒋匪埋在纸厂周围的百余颗地雷一一起出。有的战士从战壕里把蒋匪抢去的纸都拾回来，交给上级机关。此时，天津城内的蒋匪，又以榴弹炮和重炮向纸厂轰击。全厂二百九十七名职工不顾生命危险，自动留在厂内，把重要机件拆卸保存起来，并用洋灰和装了土块的麻袋，盖在仓库里的硫磺和汽油上面，终于保护了这些资材未遭炮火焚毁。当三号机房屋顶被敌炮弹打中起火时，该厂四五十位工友不顾敌人的炮火尚未停息，立即爬上屋顶，迅速扑灭了大火。职工们日夜紧张地保护着工厂，一直到天津守敌被解放军完全消灭。按该厂前属国民党资源委员会所辖之华北纸业公司，平时有职工千余名，每天产纸六十吨。
