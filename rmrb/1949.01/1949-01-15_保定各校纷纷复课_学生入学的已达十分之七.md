[Jizhong Telegram] With the efforts of the democratic government and all teachers and students, the work of restoring primary school education in Baoding City has achieved remarkable results. From the liberation to the end of 1948, in one month and nine days, the number of students reached 6,034, accounting for 70% of the original number of 8,700. The number of primary school teachers has increased from 140 at the time of liberation to 238. In the past, children from poor families had no access to education, but now they are happily sending their children to school. The rapid recovery of primary school education in Baoding City is mainly due to the correct implementation of the Party's cultural and educational policies and its policy towards intellectuals. Within a week of Baoding's liberation, the democratic government pre-emptively distributed two-thirds of the December salaries, ensuring the livelihoods of teachers, so they could all work enthusiastically and actively. Yuan Yingmin, the acting principal of Xiguan Primary School, and all the teachers personally went door-to-door to encourage students to attend school. Before liberation, the school had 133 students, and now it has grown to more than 150. The democratic government provided assistance to public and private primary schools with difficulties. Qianyi Primary School, belonging to the Qianyi Flour Company, was temporarily unable to resume work due to the company being sabotaged by the Liu bandit Hua Nan, and the school was unable to resume classes. Therefore, the democratic government subsidized its office expenses by 400,000 yuan and promised to subsidize all necessary expenses to help it resume classes. The Hui Muslim Mude Primary School was difficult to maintain even when the Liu bandits occupied the area. After liberation, in addition to subsidizing its office expenses by 300,000 yuan, the democratic government, at the request of its board of directors, approved the support for better running of Hui education. In order to quickly repair the primary schools destroyed by the bandits, the government has allocated 20,000 catties of grain. Baiyian and Gongde Primary Schools, which were most severely damaged by the bandits, are about to be completely repaired.

　　保定各校纷纷复课
  　学生入学的已达十分之七
    【冀中电】保定市小学教育恢复工作，在民主政府及全体师生的努力下，已获显著成绩。自解放迄一九四八年底，一个月零九天中，学生人数已达六千零三十四人，占原有人数八千七百人之百分之七十。小学教师已由刚解放时的一百四十人增至二百三十八人。历来贫苦家的子弟都无法求学，现在他们高高兴兴的把自己的儿女送入学校。保定市小学教育所以能够迅速的恢复，主要是正确地执行了党的文化教育政策和对知识分子的政策。民主政府于保定解放后一周内，即预先将十二月份薪金的三分之二发下，使教师生活有了保证；所以他们都能热心积极的工作。西关小学代理校长袁英民和全体教师，亲自到户动员学生上学，该校解放前有学生一百三十三人，现在已发展到一百五十余人。民主政府对有困难的公私立小学，进行了帮助。乾义面粉公司之乾义小学，因公司被刘匪化南破坏，暂时不能复工，学校也无法复课，民主政府遂辅助其办公费四十万元，并将负责补助其一切必要开支来帮助复课。回民穆德小学，在刘匪盘踞时即难以维持，解放后民主政府除补助其办公费三十万元外，为更好的举办回民教育，在其董事会的请求下，政府准予扶植。为了很快修复被匪破坏的小学，政府已拨粮两万斤。为匪破坏最甚的白衣庵，和公德小学，即将修整完竣。
