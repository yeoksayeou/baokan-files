In this election, MacArthur's headquarters sent surveillance teams to major cities and provinces to directly interfere in the election, colluding with its lackey, the Yoshida government, to threaten voters not to vote for candidates of the democratic front. Such incidents occurred in Nagoya, Kanagawa, Wakayama, and other prefectures. Plainclothes police officers appeared in several polling stations. Furthermore, many reactionary members attempted to "buy votes" with money. Eleven candidates from the Democratic Liberal Party openly engaged in bribery, causing public outrage, to the extent that the Yoshida government had to arrest them to appease popular anger. Among those who engaged in bribery were Shoji Ta, who bribed a voter with 500 yen per vote in Niigata Prefecture, and Eizaku Kato, the current Secretary-General of the Yoshida Cabinet. In addition, many other reactionaries engaged in bribery. The Yokohama Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party has filed complaints against incumbent Prime Minister Yoshida and Labor Minister Masuda for violating election laws. Under such anti-democratic actions, the Democratic Liberal Party, the darling of the American occupation authorities and Japanese Zaibatsu, was able to steal 264 seats in the House of Representatives (out of a total of 466 seats), becoming a breeding ground for reactionaries, but the seats of all other reactionary parties declined. The Socialist Party suffered the most significant drop, falling from 111 seats in the previous House of Representatives to 49 seats. The Democratic Party also fell from 90 seats to 70 seats, and the National Cooperative Party fell from 39 seats to 14 seats (note: the above seat comparisons are based on the latest statistics). Notorious leading members of the Socialist Party, such as Chairman Tetsu Katayama (former Prime Minister), former Secretary-General Suehiro Nishio (former Deputy Prime Minister of the Ashida Cabinet), Central Committee member Kanjyu Kato (former Minister of Labor in the Ashida Cabinet), Central Committee member Masaru Nozoe (former Minister of State in the Ashida Cabinet), and advisor Jiro Matsumoto, have all been defeated.

Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, reported on the 24th regarding the results of the Japanese election: Although the United States is organizing and encouraging Japanese monopoly capitalists and landlords, the democratic and socialist tide is irresistibly advancing in the East.

　　美日反动派狼狈为奸竟公开行贿干涉选举
    在这次选举中，麦克阿瑟总部在各大城与各省均派出监视组，直接干涉选举，与其走狗吉田政府狼狈为奸，威胁选民不得投民主阵线候选人的票。名古屋、神奈川、和歌山等县，均发生此种事件。若干选举站中曾出现便衣警察。而许多反动议员，又企图用金钱来“买选”。民主自由党的候选人十一名即曾公开行贿，使得群情大哗，以致吉田政府不得不加以拘捕，以缓和人民的愤怒。贿选者中有在新＠县以五百日圆贿买一张选票的田彰治及现任吉田内阁书记长加藤荣作。此外尚有其他许多反动分子进行贿选。日共横滨县委已对现首相吉田及劳工相增田的违反选举行为，提出控告。在这种反民主的行动下，美国占领当局与日本财阀的宠儿——民主自由党虽然得以窃取众院的二百六十四席（众院全部议席共四百六十六席），变为反动分子的渊薮，但其他一切反动党派的议席是一律下跌了。社会党跌得最多，它已自上届众院中的一百十一席跌至四十九席，民主党亦自九十席跌至七十席，国民协同党自三十九席跌至十四席（按：上述议席的比较，均系根据最近的统计）。恶名昭著的社会党首要分子，如总裁片山哲（曾任首相）、前书记长西尾末广（曾任芦田内阁副首相）、中委加藤勘十（曾任芦田内阁劳工相）、中委野沟胜（曾任芦田内阁国务大臣）顾问松本治二郎等，均已落选。
    电通社东京二十四日电报导日本选举的结果时称：虽然美国有组织地鼓励日本独占资本家与地主，但民主与社会主义的潮流，仍在东方不可抵抗地向前迈进着。
