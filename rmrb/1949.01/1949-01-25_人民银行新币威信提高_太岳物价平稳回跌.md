(Taiyue Electric) In December of last year, prices in the Taiyue region experienced a period of fluctuation, exhibiting an abnormal and rapid rise. After political and trade organs at all levels thoroughly publicized the significance of the issuance of the new currency of the Chinese People's Bank, and sold large quantities of goods to withdraw currency from circulation, by January 1st of this year, grain prices had fallen back by an average of 5%; by January 10th, they had fallen back by 15.13% compared to the end of December last year. For example, in Jincheng, the price of rice was 6.6 yuan per jin of the new currency on January 1st, but fell to 5.77 yuan on the 10th; corn fell from 5.79 yuan to 4.69 yuan. The average price of rice, wheat, corn, and beans fell by 17% in ten days. The amount of grain entering the market also steadily increased. For example, on the 8th, a total of 26,789 jin of grain entered the market, of which only 3,200 jin were adjusted by state-owned stores. In Yicheng and Jiyuan, all the grain entering the market on the 8th could not be sold, and grain prices fell back. In Yangcheng, the price of millet fell by 0.61 yuan per jin, and in Baodian, Changzi, the price fell by 0.12 yuan compared to the 5th. The reasons for the stabilization of grain prices include the timely adjustment of large quantities of goods by government-operated stores, publicity about the significance of the issuance of the new currency, as well as the fact that last year saw an 80% harvest. With the Lunar New Year approaching, farmers actively sold grain to buy New Year goods, which increased the amount of grain entering the market. At the same time, grain prices in the neighboring areas of northern Henan, Changzhi, and Quwo also gradually stabilized, and the phenomenon of price jumps in our region ceased. With the stabilization of grain prices, the prices of various daily necessities have also stabilized, and the prestige of the people's currency among the masses has gradually increased.

　　人民银行新币威信提高
  　太岳物价平稳回跌
    【太岳电】去年十二月份，太岳全区物价曾一度波动，表现了跳跃的不正常的上升。经过各地政治和贸易机关深入宣传中国人民新币发行的意义，并大量抛售实物，紧缩通货，到今年一月一日，粮价已平均回跌百分之五；到一月十日，比去年十二月底已回跌了百分之十五点一三。如晋城米价，一月一日每斤新币六元六角，到十日跌成了五元七角七分；玉茭由五元七角九分，跌至四元六角九分。米、麦、玉茭、豆，十天内平均下跌了百分之十七。上市粮食也源源增多。如八日上市粮食共二万六千七百八十九斤，其中公营商店调剂的粮食只有三千二百斤。翼城、济源八日上市粮食都买不完，粮价回跌，阳城小米每斤下跌了六角一分，长子鲍店七日较五日下跌一角二分。粮价稳定的原因，除政府公营商店及时调剂了大量物资，宣传了发行新币的意义，还因为去年八成丰收，旧历年将到，农民纷纷出售粮食，买卖年货，使上市粮食增多了。同时邻区豫北、长治、曲沃等地，粮食也一天一天平稳，我区跳涨现象也就停止了。由粮价平稳，各种日用品的价格也相继落稳，人民票子在群众中的威信也就逐渐提高。
