　　【Jizhong Electric】Zhao County has established a teachers' school to train forty intellectuals in rural areas, who have completed their studies and are now participating in educational work. Among the trainees, there are graduates from normal schools and middle schools before the War of Resistance, as well as old teachers who have taught for decades. Generally, their cultural level is relatively high, but their political awareness is very poor. Most of them have rarely or never read revolutionary books, and they lack even basic knowledge of the current revolutionary struggle. In the initial test, some even answered that the current People's Liberation War was "a dispute between brothers." When discussing issues, they were afraid to speak boldly and actively, and they had ideological concerns. Some people did not understand our Party's policy towards intellectuals, some were acting as "third parties," and still others came entirely to find a way out for their personal lives.

　　赵县建立师范学校训练在乡知识分子
    【冀中电】赵县建立师范学校，训练在乡知识分子四十人，已结束学习参加了教育工作。训练班的学员中，有抗战前师范、中学毕业的学生，也有教过几十年书的老教师，一般的文化程度较高，但政治认识都很差：多数人很少或根本没有看过革命的书籍，连目前革命斗争中一些常识都没有。在初次测验中，有的竟把目前人民解放战争的性质答作“兄弟阋墙之争”。在讨论问题时，都不敢大胆积极的发言，思想上有顾虑。有些人不了解我党对知识分子的政策，有些人在作“第三者”。也还有些人完全为了找个人生活出路而来的。
