The entire population of North China
Are grateful to you, all comrades of the Northeast People's Liberation Army:
	We warmly celebrate your complete annihilation of the Chiang bandit troops in the Northeast, thus completing the great victory of liberating the entire Northeast. All officers and combatants are now gladly accepting the glorious task of liberating North China and completely annihilating the Kuomintang bandit army in North China. You have readied your military attire, traveled day and night, crossed the Great Wall, and arrived in our North China.
	Now, the entire population of North China is joyously erecting colorful celebratory arches, and enthusiastically welcoming and supporting you. We hope that you will continue to work hard, closely join hands with our North China People's Liberation Army, advance shoulder to shoulder, liberate Peiping and Tianjin as soon as possible, completely overthrow the rule of the reactionaries, expel the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, so that the entire North China can be permanently liberated, and the people of North China can embark on the road of peaceful and prosperous life. We hereby express our gratitude and respect to the entire Northeast Liberation Army.
	We wish you
	Victory
		Respectfully submitted by the entire population of Xiyangshi Village, Huolu County
