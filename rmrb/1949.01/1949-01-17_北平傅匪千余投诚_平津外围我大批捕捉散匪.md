Xinhua News Agency, Pingjin Front, 15th: In the past ten days or so, over 1,400 enemy troops besieged in the isolated city of Beiping have surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. In a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army south of Beiping, 9,060 surrendering officers and soldiers of the enemy's 13th Army have been received in the past ten days. In a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the western suburbs, 571 surrendering officers and soldiers of the enemy's 92nd Army, 94th Army, 16th Army, 101st Army, and 104th Army remnants have been received in one week from the 18th to the 24th of last month. According to the surrendered enemy troops, civilian houses near Beiping were ordered to be demolished and burned by Fu's bandits, and most of the shops in the outer city were looted. The enemy troops regarded our propaganda materials as treasures when they received them. Many enemy lower-ranking officers and soldiers said, "The guns belong to Old Chiang, and we'll just hand them over when the People's Liberation Army arrives."

Pingjin Front Dispatch: Since the start of the Pingjin Campaign, the momentum has been like a hot knife through butter, and the morale of the Chiang-Fu bandit army officers and soldiers has further declined. The enemies trapped in the strongholds on the periphery of Pingjin collapse at the first touch, and some collapse on their own before contact. The number of bandit troops captured by us is endless. The Prisoner of War Department of the PLA × Unit, in just one location, captured more than 2,200 alive in six days from the 16th to the 21st, including five parts such as the puppet Fangshan, Zhuoxian, Liangwan county security regiments, the puppet Provisional New Second Army, and Wang Feifenggang's Bao Yi Brigade and Bao Er Brigade. According to preliminary statistics, there are eight field grade officers including Zhang Tingxiang, head of the puppet Fangshan County Bao Jiu Regiment, Chen Yalin, deputy head, Wang Shengji, deputy head of the regiment, Guo Maosheng, Battalion Commander of the First Battalion, Ma Defu, Battalion Commander of the × Battalion, Zhao Qinghui, Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion, Zhang Shiliang, acting head of the puppet Zhuoxian County Security Regiment, and Deng Jianxun, deputy head. There are 159 company grade officers below the deputy battalion commander. Now the Prisoner of War Department has sent this first batch to the rear for study. (Shi Lian)

Jizhong Pingjin Front Dispatch: Since the 14th of this month, our unit moved east from the Fangshan area of the Pinghan Railway, and captured more than 1,500 bandit troops in five days by the 18th. On the morning of the 14th, guards Yan Maosheng and Shan Qinghua and the Third District Team encountered the fleeing enemies from Fangshan and immediately launched a fierce attack, shouting, "Those who surrender will not be killed!" Seventy enemies laid down their weapons. On the same day, a regiment captured 30 scattered enemies alive in its garrison. In addition, more than 30 bandits from Wang Fenggang's unit surrendered their guns while crossing the river at night. At 8 pm on the 15th, the remnants of the Zhuo, Liang, and Fang county security regiments, led by Zhou Wenlong, commander of the unit, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in Gaomi Store. On the 17th, after the bandit's New Second Army's 273rd Division was defeated by friendly forces, 129 scattered bandits attempted to disguise themselves and escape in Nanchengzhuang, but were surrounded by a certain brave unit and immediately laid down their weapons. In addition, many groups of three or five were captured alive by us. Telephone operators, scouts, and communicators all captured the enemy alive. In total, 1,070 rifles, 60 light machine guns, 2 mortars, and some other weapons were seized. In the battle of Xinan to annihilate Fu's 35th Army, Zhao Chengbi, Commissioner of the Kuomintang Chahar-Mongolia Special Zone, Samu Piile, Chief of the Taibus Banner Government, Muge Dong, Chief of the Xianghuang Banner Government, and Bili Ge, secretary of the Taibus Banner Government, were captured alive by us.
