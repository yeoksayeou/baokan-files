[Jizhong Telegram] After the liberation of Baoding City, the station equipment and railway materials, which were devastatingly damaged by the Liu (Huanan) bandit gang, have been initially restored through the efforts of all employees for more than a month. Before Liu's bandit gang abandoned the city and fled, the station, the water tower's material depot, and the four iron bridges over the Fu River were all destroyed, and many technicians and staff were taken away. At that time, the order of the station was very chaotic. Worker Zang Niuzhang and others immediately rose up spontaneously and bravely protected various important equipment, so that six locomotives and two originals were not destroyed. Qi Fu, a 53-year-old veteran driver, feared that the enemy would come to the locomotive section to sabotage, so he hurriedly locked the gate and said to the workers, "The machines are our rice bowls, and we must never let them destroy them. Baoding is liberated and will connect to Shijiazhuang." After Liu's bandits fled on November 22, the workers spontaneously organized a picket team to patrol day and night and guard materials, so that the order of the station quickly stabilized. After the city's military control commission took over, it immediately established a railway custody committee and selected railway employees from the old liberated areas to form a working group to go to various sections to guide the restoration work. In addition to ordering three members of the original Kuomintang's pro-government trade union to await recruitment, all original employees were retained in their original positions. These included the director of the railway hospital, the director of the telecommunications section, and three deputy station masters of the transportation section. At the same time, positive measures were taken to guarantee the lives of employees. After completing employee registration and resumption of work, in addition to temporarily lending each person 10,000 Jichaos, the basic salary was investigated according to the original position and original salary policy, and issued in accordance with the method of converting the basic salary of Shijiazhuang railway workers into millet. The workers also launched a mass movement to collect materials, cooperated with district and street cadres, and called on the masses to return materials. Wang Baoliang, a worker in the electrical section, alone handed in two galvanometers, one electric meter, and many other important equipment. Lian Jifu, the director of the railway hospital, also handed over a complete set of surgical instruments, totaling more than 190 pieces. Many employees also picked up scrap parts from the ruins, digging out screws and spikes one by one from the soil. The remaining archives were found in the waste paper piles, and the materials that have been initially sorted out are already numerous. At the same time, the workers are actively carrying out various repair work. The railway, which was devastated by Liu's bandits, was repaired by the engineering section within two days. The locomotive section cleaned the locomotives that had been stopped for a long time and covered with dust, and once test-drove them with excellent results. The telecommunications section workers actively laid lines, and all sections are now in communication. The survey team has also set off to survey and prepare to repair roads and lay tracks, striving to open to traffic as soon as possible. Currently, the number of employees who have resumed work has reached 560, which is nearly half of the original employees. The work of the railway control committee proves that selecting a working group to assist newly liberated employees in restoring production is a better organizational form for uniting workers in the new district to understand the situation, use various forces, and promote the work of the entire station.

　　职工们交还器材努力工作
  　保定车站初步恢复
    【冀中电】保定市解放后，惨遭刘匪化南破坏的车站设备和铁路器材，经全体职工月余的努力，现已初步恢复。刘匪弃城逃窜前，车站、水塔之材料库和府河上的四座铁桥，均遭破坏，并裹走很多技工职员，当时车站秩序非常混乱。工人臧牛章等即自动奋起，英勇保护各种重要器材，使六个机车、两个原幅未被破坏。五十三岁的老司机齐辅，怕敌人到机务段破坏，忙锁上大门，对工人们说：“机器是咱的饭碗，绝不能让他们破坏了。保定解放了，还通石家庄哩。”十一月二十二日刘匪逃窜后，工人们又自动组织纠察大队，昼夜巡逻，看管物资，使车站秩序迅速安定。该市军管会接管后，立即成立铁路保管委员会，并选派老解放区铁路职工组成工作组，赴各段指导恢复工作。除对原国民党御用工会委员三人令其听候录用外，对原有职工全部原职留任。其中包括铁路医院院长，电务段主任，运输段三个副站长等。同时对职工生活采取积极措施，予以保障。在办理职工登记复工后，除每人暂借发冀钞一万元外，并按原职原薪方针，调查底薪，以石家庄路工底薪折合小米办法发给。工人们还发动了群众性的物资归集运动，配合区街干部，号召群众交还资材。电气段工人王保良一人交出电流计二个，电表一个及其他重要器材甚多。铁路医院院长连吉孚也已交出一付全套的外科手术器材，共一百九十余件。许多职工并从废墟堆中捡废零件，将螺丝道钉一个个从土中刨出。在废纸堆中找出残存的档案，现初步整理出之物资，已为数甚巨。与此同时，工人们又积极进行各项修理工作。横遭刘匪破坏的铁路，工务段两天内即修复。机务段把长久停驶、密布尘土的机车擦得净光，并曾一度试车，效果甚佳。电务段工人积极架线，现各段均已通话。测量队亦已出发测量，准备修路铺轨，争取早日通车。现复工员工已达五百六十人，将近原有职工半数。在铁路管制会方面的工作证明：选派工作组协助新解放职工恢复生产，是团结新区工人了解情况、使用各种力量、推动全站工作较好的组织形式。
