Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 26th: The eight peace terms put forward by the Chinese Communist Party have become so undeniably the sole national consensus that the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government had to pretend to adopt them as the standard for negotiations from the 22nd. The work of the Nanjing reactionary government is now concentrated in two aspects: First, to do everything possible to preserve the strength of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, so that it can safely weather the current revolutionary storm sweeping the country, in order to stage a comeback at an appropriate time. They hope to gain three months of breathing space to reorganize and newly compile dozens of divisions to facilitate renewed fighting. This secret order has been issued by war criminal Gu Zhutong. Second, to distort the content of the eight terms, so that they change from terms of genuine peace to terms of false peace, and on the basis of this false peace, to unite various wavering and disguised "democratic" elements to form a barrier against the genuine peace movement.

The Nanjing reactionary government's plan to preserve the strength of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is first manifested in the "resignation" of the No. 1 war criminal Chiang Kai-shek. Even the American bourgeoisie does not conceal the truth about Chiang Kai-shek's "resignation." As early as December 31 last year, CBS predicted: "The cruel fact shows that the Communist victory is nearing completion, and Chiang Kai-shek's only value to the country is to maintain his personal position in retirement while still serving the country." Now Chiang Kai-shek is precisely maintaining his "service to the country" in this way. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd of this month stated: "Li Zongren himself and other government figures do not believe that Li is Chiang Kai-shek's definite successor, but only consider him as an agent during Chiang's absence from office." The dispatch hinted: "Chiang Kai-shek may subsequently declare all steps taken by Li Zongren invalid." The dispatch pointed out that Li Zongren had not taken any action to stop the continued southward transfer of government agencies and assets, and could not command Chiang Kai-shek's army. A Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 24th stated: 150,000 to 200,000 troops personally commanded by Chiang Kai-shek are heading to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. This is "part of the political drama of the past four days." It is evident that all the actual strength of the Kuomintang continues to prepare for war. It is entirely believable that Chiang Kai-shek still maintains complete command over these southward-moving armed and civilian forces. In fact, the US government has enabled Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren to implement such a division of labor: Chiang Kai-shek has left the unsafe Nanjing and continues to actually command the combat forces in Jiangnan and Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Taiwan and other places in the capacity of "President," while ordering Li Zongren, who remains in Nanjing, to use his "Presidential Palace" as a stage to perform various "peace" dramas to cover up the deployment of combat forces. Because using "peace" to build a "Yangtze River defense line" now seems more useful than a military defense line.

For this purpose, China's second war criminal, American puppet Li Zongren, and others in Nanjing who pretend to advocate peace are now verbally declaring their acceptance of the eight terms proposed by the Chinese Communist Party and unanimously supported by the leading figures of all democratic parties and the people of the whole country. But are their statements true? When people examine this issue, they cannot fail to notice that the peace talk representatives designated by Li Zongren, Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong, are spreading absurd distortions of the eight terms. For example, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd, Shao and Zhang even attempted to distort "reorganizing all reactionary troops according to democratic principles" as reorganizing the Kuomintang army and the People's Liberation Army according to the Marshall Plan of February 1946, which never took effect and has long been discarded. Most noteworthy is Shao and Zhang's statement regarding the first condition, namely, punishing war criminals. They said: "Since Chiang Kai-shek has resigned, the government is waiting for the Communist side to indicate its intentions regarding the other forty-two war criminals listed on their list of war criminals." Here lies the dividing line between true and false peace. The conspirators of false peace believe that Chiang Kai-shek's departure from Nanjing because he is "unable to perform his duties due to illness" counts as punishing war criminals. People want to ask: Is this punishing war criminals? This is merely harboring or indulging war criminals. Following Chiang Kai-shek, other major war criminals in Nanjing, such as Chen Lifu and Gu Zhenggang, have successively escaped, and Song Ziwen has fled to Hong Kong. A Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd stated: "Kuomintang leaders listed as war criminals are today packing their bags in Nanjing in preparation for a possible escape with Chiang Kai-shek. Most war criminals who have no hope for the CCP have already left here."

Now, the Nanjing Li Zongren government and its collaborators have a way to prove whether they have sincerity for peace, and that is to immediately detain a large number of key war criminals such as Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Cheng, He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, Liu Zhi, Tang Enbo, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Jianqun, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Jingguo, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, Dai Chuanxian, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Xiufeng, and bring foreign war criminals to justice. Observers here believe that Nanjing's pseudo-Acting President Li Zongren and pseudo-Executive Yuan President Sun Ke themselves are important war criminals. Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi are both lovely figures who signed various agreements with the Communist Party in the past, later tore up these agreements without saying a word, and participated in the pseudo-National Assembly to support Chiang Kai-shek as a pseudo-President. If the gentlemen of the Li Zongren government want to rely on playing tricks to win the trust of the people, it is futile. Only if they truly implement the first step of the first article of the eight terms, that is, detain the war criminals and hand them over to the people's government for trial, will they have the possibility of being forgiven by the people for their merits.

### 南京反动政府阴谋毕露　一面图保存势力卷土重来一面以假和平对抗真和平  陕北观察家认为只有交出战犯才有将功折罪的可能

　　南京反动政府阴谋毕露
  　一面图保存势力卷土重来一面以假和平对抗真和平
    陕北观察家认为只有交出战犯才有将功折罪的可能
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中国共产党所提出的八项和平条件，已经如此无可争辩地成为全国的唯一国是，以致南京国民党反动政府从二十二日起也不得不假装奉为谈判的标准。南京反动政府的工作现在集中在两方面：第一，尽力保存蒋介石反动集团的势力，使之安然渡过目前席卷全国的革命风暴，以便在适当时机卷土重来。他们希望取得三个月喘息时间，整编及新编几十个师，以利再战，此项密令已由战犯顾祝同发出。第二，歪曲八项条件的内容，使之由真和平和的条件变为假和平的条件，并在这种假和平的基础上团结各种不坚定的和伪装的“民主”分子，来形成一个对抗真和平运动的壁垒。南京反动政府关于保存蒋介石反动集团势力的计划，首先表现于第一号战争罪犯蒋介石的“离职”行动。蒋介石“离职”的真相甚至美国资产阶级也并不加以隐瞒。早在去年十二月三十一日，哥伦比亚广播公司就预告说：“残酷的事实显示：共产党的胜利已接近完成，蒋介石对国家的唯一价值是使他个人的地位在退引中仍保持对国家的效劳。”现在蒋介石正是这样地保持着他“对国家的效劳”。美联社南京本月二十二日电称：“李宗仁本人以及政府其他人物都不认为李已是蒋介石的确定继承者，而认为他不过是蒋离职期间的代理者而已。”该电讯暗示：“蒋介石可能在嗣后宣布李宗仁所采取的一切步骤为无效”。该电讯指出李宗仁并没有采取任何行动制止政府机关和资财的继续南迁，而且不能指挥蒋介石的军队。路透社上海二十四日电称：十五万至二十万蒋介石亲自指挥的军队正在开往浙江、江西、广东与福建，这是“四日来政治戏剧的一部分”。由此可见，国民党的一切实际力量都在继续准备作战。完全可以相信：蒋介石对于这些南迁的武装力量和文装力量仍然保持着完整的指挥权。事实上美国政府已使蒋介石与李宗仁实行了这样的分工：蒋介石离开了不安全的南京，继续以“总统”的身份实际上指挥作战的力量在江南及浙江、福建、江西、湖南、广东、台湾各地布防，而令留在南京的李宗仁利用他的“总统府”作为舞台，演出种种“和平”的戏剧以掩护作战力量的部署。因为用“和平”来建设“长江防线”现在是比军事的防线似乎较为有用些了。为此目的，中国第二名战争罪犯美国傀儡李宗仁和南京其他伪装主和的人们现在在口头上声明承认中国共产党所提出而为一切民主党派的领导人物及全国人民所一致支持的八项条件。但是他们的声明是真的吗？人们考察这个问题的时候，不能不注意到李宗仁所指定的和谈代表邵力子张治中正在散布对于八项条件的荒谬曲解。例如据法新社南京二十三日电称：邵张竟试图把“依据民主原则改编一切反动军队”曲解为依据从未生效并早已作废的一九四六年二月马歇尔方案来改编国民党军和人民解放军。最可注意的是邵张关于第一项条件即惩办战争罪犯的表示。他们说：“蒋介石既已去职，政府刻正等待共方表明对于载在他们的战犯名单上的其他四十二名战犯的意图。”这里划出了真假和平的分界线。假和平的阴谋家们以为蒋介石“因故不能视事”而离开南京就算是惩办战争罪犯。人们要问：这是惩办战争罪犯吗？这不过是窝藏或放纵战争罪犯罢了。紧接在蒋介石之后，南京其他首要战争罪犯陈立夫、谷正纲等均已相继逃逸，宋子文则已逃往香港。路透社南京二十三日电称：“名列战犯名单的国民党领袖们今日正在南京摒挡行装，以备随蒋介石做可能的逃亡。对中共不寄任何希望的大多数战犯业已离此他去。”现在南京李宗仁政府及其合作者有一个方法证明他们有无和平的诚意，这就是把蒋介石、宋子文、陈立夫、谷正纲、陈诚、何应钦、顾祝同、刘峙、汤恩伯、张群、王世杰、朱家骅、刘健群、吴国桢、潘公展、蒋经国、张君劢、左舜生、戴传贤、郑介民、叶秀峰等一大批首要战犯立即加以扣留，并将国外的战犯缉拿归案。此间观察家认为：南京伪代总统李宗仁和伪行政院长孙科本人都是重要的战争罪犯，张治中和邵力子都是过去与共产党签订过种种协定、后来撕毁这些协定时他们一声不响、并参加伪国民大会拥护蒋介石做伪总统的可爱的人物，李宗仁政府的先生们如果想要依靠玩弄花样来取信于人民，那是徒然的；只有他们实实在在地执行了八项条件的第一条的第一步，即将战争罪犯们加以扣留交给人民政府审判，他们才有因将功折罪而获得人民宽恕的可能。
