Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 28th: TASS, Moscow, January 24th: Representatives of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia held an economic conference in Moscow this month. The conference affirmed that the aforementioned countries had achieved considerable success in the development of economic relations, primarily reflected in the substantial increase in trade. Due to the establishment of economic relations and the implementation of a policy of economic cooperation, the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union have had the opportunity to accelerate the restoration and development of their respective national economies. The conference further confirmed that, due to the resolute opposition of the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union to the Marshall Plan, which infringes upon the sovereignty of various countries and their national economic interests, the United States, Britain, and certain other countries in Western Europe have, in fact, been resisting trade relations with the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union. In view of the above circumstances, the conference discussed and decided that, in order to establish broader economic cooperation between the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union, it is necessary to establish a Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The council will be composed of representatives of the participating countries on the basis of equal representation; its task is to exchange experience in the economic field, provide technical assistance to each other, and provide mutual assistance in raw materials, food, machinery, and equipment. The conference declared that the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an open organization, and any other European country that agrees with the principles of the council and is willing to participate in broad economic cooperation with the aforementioned countries may join. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance may only adopt decisions with the consent of the countries concerned, and will hold regular meetings in rotation in the capitals of the signatory countries, presided over by the representative of the host country.

　　苏联与东欧各国加强经济合作
  　建立经济互助委员会
    在机器原料技术等方面彼此互助
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：苏、保、匈、波、罗、捷六国代表，本月间曾在莫斯科举行了经济会议。会议确认上述各国间在经济关系发展中已获得相当大的成就，这首先表现在贸易来往的巨大增加上。由于建立了经济关系并履行了经济合作政策，各人民民主国家与苏联便有了加速恢复并发展它们各自的国民经济的机会。会议进一步地确证：由于人民民主国家和苏联坚决反对侵犯各国主权及其国民经济利益的马歇尔计划，因此，美英和西欧其他某些国家在事实上就一直在抵制对各人民民主国家及苏联的贸易关系。有鉴于以上的情况，会议讨论并决定：为了建立各人民民主国家与苏联之间更加广泛的经济合作，必须设立经济互助委员会。该委员会将在平等代表权的基础上由与会各国的代表组成；其任务是交换经济方面的经验，彼此进行技术援助，并在原料、粮食、机器设备等方面进行互助。会议宣称：经济互助委员会为公开的组织，凡同意互助委员会原则、并愿参加与上述国家之广泛经济合作的欧洲其他国家，皆可加入。经济互助委员会只有经过各有关国家的同意，才得通过决定，且将于会议所在国代表的主持下轮流在签约各国首定期举行会议。
