[This Newspaper News] Encouraged by victory, after receiving instructions from superiors to support the army, all employees of this newspaper's printing plant were brainstorming how to best make comfort bags to express their love and support for the soldiers at the front. Some comrades went to Pingshan City to find tailors, while others asked their families and fellow villagers to sew them. After work on the afternoon of the 17th, a general employee meeting was held to launch an army support campaign. Chairman Zhao Tiezhu began by saying, "The main purpose of today's meeting is to write letters of support and make comfort bags for the People's Liberation Army that liberated Tianjin, Tanggu, and is in the process of liberating Beiping. After liberating all of Northeast China, they haven't had time to rest and have come to North China day and night during the coldest days of winter, taking many large cities." Before the chairman finished speaking, the atmosphere in the meeting was already high, with shouts and applause resounding throughout the room. Each department competed with each other, and a female comrade from the proofreading department, holding comfort bags, proposed a competition to all departments of the plant to see who could make them faster and better. Comrade Zhu Qifa donated a pair of woolen socks, two towels, a bar of soap, a pencil, a diary, a tobacco pouch, needles and thread, and many other comfort items. Comrade Zheng Zhong of the cooperative said, "In addition to the comfort bag I have already made, I represent the cooperative in competing with the proofreading department and will work overnight to make comfort bags, guaranteeing to hand them over tomorrow." Comrade Tian Zhongyuan, representing the stereotyping department, said, "In addition to donating comfort items tomorrow, we guarantee that in the future we will not invert or misprint a single character in our work, and we will advance the newspaper's publication time to support the front lines." The typesetting department and responsible comrades from each department all represented their departments in competing with the proofreading department. Through the efforts of all employees, 56 comfort bags, 65 towels, 81 packs of cigarettes, and 28 letters of support were donated on the 18th. In order to adapt to the victorious situation and facilitate army support work, a army support committee consisting of three comrades, including Zhu Qifa, was elected at the meeting. Other departments of this newspaper are also involved in the army support movement and are currently rushing to make comfort bags. (Li Yaotang, Zhao Tiezhu).

Also: After learning of the political department's call to support the soldiers at the front, the business department of the North China Military Region Political Department Printing Bureau was the first to respond. At the department meeting, Director Wang casually mentioned the matter of support - the goal was to first prepare everyone mentally before proceeding with donations. Unexpectedly, it was a great surprise, because everyone was very enthusiastic about this matter and wanted to do it immediately. They immediately adopted a unified purchasing and free donation method, rushing to donate money to buy comfort items and comfort bags.

Other units of the bureau are also actively preparing. They use snow-white bleached cloth to make bags, and sew red edges, with woolen ropes strung on the bag openings, which are both beautiful and practical, and will be completed soon. (Chen Ru)

　　本报及军区政治部印刷厂职工
  　争相赶制慰劳袋
    浇版部保证提高工作效率支援前线
    【本报讯】本报印刷厂全体职工在胜利的鼓舞下，接到上级劳军指示后，同志们都在酝酿着：如何做好慰问袋，表示出对前方战士热爱支援的心意。有的同志赴平山城找裁缝做，有的找家属和老乡缝。十七日下午下课后，接着开全体职工会，响应发起劳军大会，首由主席赵铁柱说：“今天开的会，主要是为解放天津、塘沽和正在解放北平的人民解放军写慰问信、做慰问袋。因为他们解放全东北后，尚未有时间休息，在严寒的三九天不分昼夜开来华北，打下了许多大城市。”主席讲话未完，会场情绪即已高涨，喊话和鼓掌，一片响声。各部都争先恐后，校对科一位女同志满怀抱着慰问袋笑嘻嘻的向全厂各部提出比赛，看谁做的快做的好。工友朱启发同志献出洋袜一双、毛巾两条、肥皂一条、铅笔、日记本、烟袋、针线等很多慰问品。合作社郑重同志说：“除我已做好慰问袋交出外，代表合作社向校对科比赛，连夜赶制慰问袋，保证明天交出。”田忠元同志代表浇版部说：“除明天献出慰问品外，保证今后在工作上不颠倒一字，不错一字，并且提前报纸出版时间，来支援前线。”排字部和各部负责同志都代表自己部门和校对科比赛。经全体职工同志努力购买物品连夜赶制，十八日共献出慰问袋五十六件、毛巾六十五条、纸烟八十一盒等，慰问信二十八封。为了适应胜利局面、便于劳军工作，并在大会上选出劳军委员会委员朱启发等三同志。本报其他部门，亦卷入劳军运动，刻正在赶制慰问袋。（李耀唐、赵铁柱）。
    又：华北军区政治部印刷局得知政治部发出慰劳前方将士的号召后，营业部首先响应，该部开会时，王主任顺便提出慰劳之事——目的是先要大家在思想上有一准备，然后好进行捐助。不料竟出乎意外，因为大家对此事非常热忱，都愿马上就办，当即采用统一购买，自由乐捐的办法，争先恐后的捐款买慰问品及慰劳袋。
    该局其他单位也正在积极筹办中，他们用雪白漂布做袋，并缝着红边，袋口上串着毛线绳既美观又实用不日即可全部完成。
