　　Zhengzhou and Kaifeng Clear Out Enemy Currency
  　Zhongzhou Currency Becomes the Sole Legal Tender
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 12th] Enemy currency in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng has now been completely cleared out. The Zhongzhou currency issued by the Central Plains Liberated Area People's Government has become the sole legal tender in the markets of both cities. Before the liberation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, the total amount of enemy currency circulating in the markets of the two cities was estimated to be about 10 trillion legal tender yuan (converted into puppet legal tender), of which puppet gold yuan accounted for 70% and puppet legal tender accounted for 30%. Due to the continuous devaluation of enemy currency, prices soared, industry and commerce went bankrupt, and the people's lives were miserable. After the People's Liberation Army liberated Zhengzhou and Kaifeng on October 22nd and 24th of last year, the military control committees and people's governments of the two cities respectively issued announcements, setting a time limit to ban the circulation of puppet legal tender and puppet gold yuan. Party and government cadres, students, and members of cultural work troupes went deep into the districts and streets of the city, convening citizens' meetings to publicize the victory of the People's Liberation War and the harm of enemy currency to the people, announced the people's government's order to ban the circulation of enemy currency within a time limit, and called on and guided citizens to withdraw enemy currency in an organized manner in exchange for materials. At the same time, the governments of the two cities issued Zhongzhou currency loans and sold materials at stable prices to support production and stabilize prices. Zhengzhou issued more than 7 million Zhongzhou currency in industrial, commercial, and small loans, and sold more than 200,000 jin of rice, more than 100,000 jin of flour, and more than 80,000 jin of salt at stable prices, ensuring the basic needs of the citizens. Kaifeng issued 7.35 million yuan in production loans and sold 750,000 jin of grain at stable prices. These correct measures of the people's government were warmly supported by the people, enabling the successful completion of the task of eliminating enemy currency in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, and also enabling Zhongzhou currency to occupy the market and maintain a relatively stable value. However, in this work, due to the insufficient coordination between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, the government's initial preparation for the issuance of Zhongzhou currency was not sufficient, and the crackdown on money peddlers who sold silver dollars and undermined the credibility of Zhongzhou currency was not resolute enough, which, to a certain extent, seriously damaged the smooth and rapid progress of the work. Furthermore, during the period of eliminating enemy currency in Kaifeng, the grain prices were suppressed too low, and farmers in the suburbs found it unprofitable to import grain, resulting in a decrease in supply, while the public stores did not have enough materials to make timely and full adjustments. As a result, within three days from November 26th to 28th last year, speculative merchants took advantage of this and caused price fluctuations for a time. Zhengzhou, on the other hand, prolonged the time for eliminating enemy currency due to excessive leniency towards the small amount of enemy currency held by farmers in the surrounding areas. All of the above affected the consolidation of the value of Zhongzhou currency and the early elimination of enemy currency to a certain extent, causing unnecessary losses to the people, which should be taken as a lesson.

　　郑州开封敌币肃清
  　中州票已成唯一通货
    【新华社中原十二日电】郑州、开封两地的敌币，现在已被完全肃清，中原解放区人民政府所发行的中州票已成为两地市场上唯一通货。在郑州、开封解放以前，敌币在两地市场流通者，估计总数约有法币十万亿元（折成伪法币计算）之多，其中伪金圆券占百分之七十，伪法币占百分之三十。由于敌币不断贬值，造成物价高涨，工商业破产，人民生活苦不堪言。人民解放军于去年十月二十二日及二十四日先后解放郑州、开封后，两地军事管制委员会及人民市政府，便分别发出布告，限期禁止伪法币、伪金圆券流通；党政干部、学生和文工团团员纷纷深入城内各区和街市，分头召开市民大会，宣传人民解放战争的胜利和敌币对人民的危害，宣布人民政府限期禁止敌币流通的命令，号召和指导市民有组织地推出敌币，换回物资；同时两地人民政府均发放中州票贷款，平售物资，以扶植生产，平稳物价。郑州共发放工商业及小本贷款中州币七百余万元，平售大米二十余万斤，面粉十余万斤，食盐八万余斤，保证了市民的生活需要。开封共发放生产贷款七百三十五万元，平售粮食七十五万斤。人民政府的这些正确措施，受到人民的热烈拥护，使郑州、开封的排除敌币工作胜利完成，也使中州票得以占领市场而且币值相对地稳定。但在这一工作中，由于郑州、开封两市配合不够密切，政府在开始时对于中州票的发行准备不够充分，对于贩卖银元、破坏中州币信用的钱贩的取缔不够坚决，曾经在一定时期相当损害了工作的顺利和迅速推进。又开封在排除敌币时期，把粮价平抑过低，四郊农民因输入粮食无利可图，来源减少，而公家商店掌握的物资不多未能及时充分调剂，结果，在去年十一月二十六日至二十八日三天之内，曾为投机商人所乘，一度引起物价波动。郑州则因过分姑息四乡农民手中的少数敌币，而延长了排除敌币的时间。上述这一切，均在一定程度上影响了中州币价值的巩固，以及敌币的早日排除，使人民蒙受不必要的损失，应引为教训。
