The cultivation area of ​​major grains will reach 7.52 million hectares (1 hectare equals 16 Chinese mu). The cultivation area of potatoes, sugar beets and oilseed crops has been increasing. By the end of this year, the average per capita output of agricultural products, except for meat and milk, will exceed the pre-war level. The plan stipulates an increase of 45 percent in railway freight volume. This year, the domestic trade volume is set at 1,444.7 billion zlotys; foreign trade will exceed 1948 by 15 percent (according to Warsaw newspapers, foreign trade in 1948 increased more than threefold compared to 1947). In 1949, national income will exceed 20 billion pre-war zlotys. After Mr. Dettling's report, representatives of all parties in the parliament spoke, unanimously expressing their trust in and support for the government, and fully approving his policies.
