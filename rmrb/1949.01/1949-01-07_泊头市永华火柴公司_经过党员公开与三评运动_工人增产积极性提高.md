　　Bohou City Yonghua Match Company
  　Worker Enthusiasm for Increased Production Rises After Open Party Member and Three-Evaluation Movement
    [Our Newspaper] Lin Yuan reports: After the open Party member and "three-evaluation" movement (evaluating work, relationships, and study) at the Yonghua Match Company in Bohou City, Hebei Province, the workers' awareness has generally improved. Starting from December 6th, a month-long, red-hot production drive has been launched.
    This company has a relatively long history. It was originally founded in the second year of the Republic of China. In the past, the factory's "First" and "Globe" brand matches enjoyed a high reputation, comparable to those from Tianjin. After the "July 7th" Incident, work was suspended for a year before resuming. Later, due to the oppression of the Japanese invaders, it was forced to shut down again in the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China. In the 34th year, the Kuomintang County Magistrate dug dikes and released water, causing more than 300 rooms in the factory to collapse, and some of the machinery was damaged by silt. In May of the 35th year, Bohou was liberated, and our democratic government helped the factory to start work in order to develop industry. In March of this year, Li Xiuyan, the original shareholder's agent, requested government investment and assistance. With the approval of the Hebei Administrative Office, the public loan was made into shares, and it was changed to a joint public-private enterprise. Comrade Zhang Shuo, the government representative, was appointed as manager, and Li was appointed as deputy manager. Since then, through the joint efforts of all employees, careful management and operations have led to great improvements in business: First, a trade union was established, correcting the excessive wage bias and implementing a comprehensive wage system; in August, a production and conservation campaign was launched, stipulating that extra bonuses would be given for exceeding the expected production volume, greatly stimulating the workers' production enthusiasm; in November, the factory branch was made public, with a total of 85 Party members, accounting for nearly one-fifth of all employees; Party members launched self-criticism in front of the workers, which increased the Party's prestige among the masses, and more than 30 workers requested to join the Party (17 have been approved); Party members also led the masses into the "three-evaluation" movement, launching mass self-criticism and mutual criticism. Many workers felt that they had many shortcomings in the past and automatically requested to increase production to make up for past losses. This further improved the relationship between workers and the factory. On this basis, in response to the call of Hebei Province to "fully launch a production campaign to meet military and civilian needs," under the leadership of the factory management committee, after group discussions, individual planning, and enthusiastic challenges between various departments, a mobilization meeting of all employees was held on December 5th. Each department reported on its self-made labor agreements. The workers were all eager to try and spoke enthusiastically.
    The requirements of this movement focused on improving quality: the medicine head should be uniform, there should be fewer rotten stems (match sticks) and double heads, the box material, box pieces, and box bottom should be the same size, the boxes should be full, and the trademarks should be clear and the decoration beautiful. In response to market needs, the daily output was stipulated to increase from 20 boxes (1440 packs per box) to 26 boxes. Workers encouraged each other, and the consciousness of labor was unprecedentedly improved. In the past, when the work bell rang, workers would slowly walk into the machine room. Now, they arrive at the machine room at daybreak to organize the machines. As soon as the bell rang, the machines started running. In the past, when the engineering department made inspections, some workers were not convinced and said strange things. This time, when the comrades in the engineering department made suggestions, the workers were able to accept them humbly and replied kindly: "We will pay attention to it in the future." Everyone also put forward the slogans of "no waste," "no damage to machines," "no unjustified leave," and "no absenteeism." Prior to this, the daily attendance rate was 89 percent. During the first week of the movement, the actual attendance rate of workers was 97.98 percent. In terms of output, the daily output has now increased to 30 boxes, and one day it reached 32 boxes (three more row-axis machines, oil pans, and medicine pans were added, and more than 40 female workers were added to the packaging team). In the past, the nine row-axis machines averaged 46 carriages per machine per day (30 boards per carriage, 2400 seedlings per board weighing three ounces). During the first week of the movement, the daily output per machine was 51 carriages, an increase of 10.4 percent. Comrade Wang Ximing, a Party member, was the most outstanding, shaking the most, and one day he shook 63 carriages, and usually maintained 58 or 59 carriages. The box material turning machine has the highest production efficiency. In the past, each machine produced 277,000 box materials per day, now it has increased to 358,000 box materials, an actual increase of 29 percent. The sawing stock increased from a daily output of 112 square feet of wood to 130.2 square feet. In the past, two people in the lithography team cut work, cutting 800,000 to 900,000 work pieces per day (the paper for pasting a matchbox is a work piece). This time, Comrade Zhang Mochi, a Party member, volunteered to cut alone, cutting 700,000 to 800,000 work pieces per day, and the efficiency almost doubled.
    The exquisite workmanship of the workers in each unit has also made significant progress in terms of quality: defective products and double heads have been reduced. Before the movement, 3.65 catties of defective double-headed matches were produced per box, now it has dropped to 3.14 catties. In the past, the plate was smashed on the oil pan due to excessive force, damaging the plate surface. Now everyone pays attention to it; when putting the plate, the sulfur head is facing down, so that the sulfur is easily condensed on the stem head, which makes the match head appear large and uniform. The packaging technology has also been improved, with almost 100 matches in each box. Comrade Kang Bo, a technician at the factory, carefully researched and developed the production of phosphorus sulfide, which is bright in color, yellow and brittle. In addition, the raw materials are pure, and more than 600 catties have been produced, which can reduce the cost by 120,000 to 130,000 yuan (border currency) per pound compared to using red phosphorus. And it is non-toxic and beneficial to the health of workers. Because the production volume is still small and cannot all be made into phosphorus sulfide matches, in the production movement, the "First" brand matches made of a mixture of yellow phosphorus and phosphorus sulfide ignite quickly and stably when struck, and are very popular among merchants, who all reflect that they are stronger than the "Three Lights" brand matches produced in Jinan. Therefore, the factory's matches are not only selling well in various parts of Hebei Province, but Dezhou and Linqing, which were once exclusively dominated by Jinan matches, have now been replaced by Yonghua's "First" brand matches, and there is a trend of supply falling short of demand.
    However, the reporter feels that there are still some biases and shortcomings in the factory's production movement: First, the factory's guiding ideology is not clear enough on focusing on improving quality, and it has not better inspired the wisdom of the workers and masses to research and create; instead, it is biased towards emphasizing increased production, which makes the workers' working hours too long, especially the packaging female workers and child laborers, whose working hours are as long as 13 hours, which will affect their health and development, and the factory must immediately correct this. In addition, the factory's care for workers' learning is still lacking, and close attention should be paid to this.

　　泊头市永华火柴公司
  　经过党员公开与三评运动
  　工人增产积极性提高
    【本报讯】林远报导：冀中泊头市永华火柴公司经过党员公开与“三评”运动（评工作、评关系、评学习），工人的觉悟普遍提高，自十二月六日起，展开一个月的热火朝天的生产运动。
    该公司有比较悠久的历史。原创立于民国二年，事迹前该厂所出的“第一”和“地球”牌火柴，即久享盛誉，与天津货媲美。“七七”事变后停工一年旋即复工，后因日寇的压榨，于民国三十三年秋季又被迫停工。三十四年国民党县长掘堤放水，该厂倒房三百余间，一部分机器淤泥损坏。三十五年五月泊头解放，我民主政府为发展工业，帮助该厂开工。今年三月，原股东代理人李秀岩请求政府投资扶助，经冀中行署批准，将公家贷款作成股金，改为公私合营；由政府代表张硕同志充经理，李任副理。自此，经全体职工共同努力，渗淡经营，业务有很大改进：首先建立了职工会，纠正了过高工资偏向、实行了全面工资制；八月份开始生产节约运动，规定凡超出应有生产量给予额外奖金，大大刺激了工人生产情绪；十一月份该厂支部公开，共有党员八十五名，几占全体职工的五分之一；党员在工人面前展开自我批评，致使党在群众中的威信提高，有三十多个工人要求入党（已批准了十七个）；党员并带动了群众进入“三评”运动，展开群众性的自我批评与互相批评，许多工人在检讨中感到过去缺点很多，自动要求增产，弥补过去损失，这进一步改善了工人与厂方的关系。在这种基础上，迎接了冀中“全力开展生产运动，以应军需民用”的号召，在工厂管理委员会的领导下，经过小组酝酿，个人订计划，与各股互相间的热烈挑战，到十二月五日全体职工的动员大会，各股报告自订的劳动公约，工人们个个磨拳擦掌，争先发言，情绪至为热烈。
    这次运动的要求，以提高质量为主：药头要匀，烂梗子（火柴杆）和双头要少，盒料、盒匹和盒底一般大，装盒要满，商标清楚、装璜美观。因应市场需要，规定日产量由二十箱（每箱一四四○包）提高到二十六箱。工人互相勉励，劳动的自觉性空前提高；过去，上班铃响了，工人多慢腾腾的走进机器房，现在，天刚亮就到机器房，整理机器，铃声一响，机器就开动了。过去，工务科检查时，有的工人不服气，说些怪话，这次，工务科同志提出了意见，工人们都能虚心接受，并和气的回答：“以后注意好了”。大家并提出了“不浪费”，“不损坏机器”，“不无故请假”，“不旷工”的口号。在这以前，每日实到人数占百分之八十九，运动第一周实到工人数则为百分之九七点九八。在产量上，日产量刻已提高到三十箱，有一天曾达到三十二箱（多添置三个排轴机、油盘、药盘各一个、包装股女工添了四十多名）。过去九部排轴机，平均每个机器日产量排出四十六车（每车三十板，每板二四○○根苗三两重），运动第一周每部机器日产量为五十一车，提高了百分之十点四。党员王锡铭同志最突出，摇的最多，有一天曾摇到六十三车，而平常也保持五十八、九车。镟盒料机生产效率最高，过去每机日产量出二十七万七千盒料，现在则提高到三十五万八千盒料，实增百分之二十九。锯木股由日产量截出木一一二平方尺，提高到一三○点二平方尺。石印股过去两个人切活，每天切八十到九十万活（糊一个火柴盒的纸是一个活），这次党员张墨池同志自报奋勇一个人切，每天切出七十到八十万活，效率几提高一倍。
    各单位工人的精工细作，在质量方面也有显著的进步：残品和双头减少了，运动前每箱出残品双头火柴三点六五斤，现在则降为三点一四斤。过去油盘上砸板，因使力过大，砸坏了板面，现在大家都注了意；在放板时，将硫磺头冲下，使磺易于凝聚在梗子头，显得火柴头大也均匀。包装技术也有了改进，每盒都有差不多一百根。该厂技师康波同志底精心钻研，试制的硫化磷，色泽鲜亮，黄而脆，此外来货还纯，现已制出六百余斤，比用赤磷每磅可减少成本十二、三万元（边币）。而且没毒，对工人健康有利。因为制出量还少，不能全部做硫化磷火柴，在生产运动中，以黄磷和硫化磷混合物制出的“第一”牌火柴，划时发火既快且稳，很受商贩欢迎，都反映比济南出的“三光”牌火柴强。所以，该厂火柴不但畅销冀中各地，一向为济南火柴独占市场的德州和临清，现在已被永华的“第一”牌火柴起而代之，且有供不应求之势。
    但该厂的生产运动，记者则感到尚存有若干偏向和缺点：首先是该厂在指导思想上对以提高质量为主不够明确，没有更好的启发工人群众的智慧，大家研究、创造；而偏于强调增产，而使工人劳动时间过长，尤其是包装的女工、童工劳动时间竟长达十三小时，这是会影响她们的健康和发展，该厂必须立即纠正。另外，该厂关于工人学习的照顾还差，也应密加注意。
