　　Small Shops Wrongfully Confiscated Cannot Be Refused Return With Excuses
　　To the Editor:
　　I am from Guancun Village, West Street, Shen County. In 1942, I started a sesame cake shop in the city with pooled shares. In addition to retail sales, the puppet police force often used millet to exchange for sesame cakes. Gradually, it became an oil and vinegar shop. The furniture in this shop was all borrowed from others, and there were no hired workers. Everyone was a partner. After two years of operation, the business developed very well. After the Japanese surrender, it continued to operate as usual. However, during the review and struggle, this business was confiscated. The reason was that two of our six shareholders were pseudo-affiliated (but most of the other shareholders were middle peasants, and some were poor peasants, not meeting the conditions for being struggled against). This upset me greatly. I worked hard for several years, and now I have nothing to show for it. Later, I heard that our government protects industry and commerce, and I was very happy, but until now, there has been no news about our shop. A few days ago, I went to the village cadres, and they said that the village had a meeting and had no objections, so it went to the district for discussion, but the district emphasized that it could not be returned because: first, the village is still operating this business, and the interests of the village cannot be infringed; second, the stage is not right, if it was struggled during the division of property, it could be returned, otherwise, it would not be returned. This made me anxious. Although I don't understand the policies, others are urging us to return the borrowed furniture, and we can't afford to return it. What should we do? Please, editor, help me find a solution and give me an answer.　　　　　　　(Duan Ping)
    Answer:
    The principle of our party's industrial and commercial policy is that, except for the bureaucratic capital headed by the four major families and the industry and commerce of traitors and war criminals, all other legitimate industries and businesses are under the protection of the government. There have also been instructions regarding the encroachment on industry and commerce during land reform, which must be resolutely corrected. Those that have been confiscated but not yet distributed should be returned to the original owners, and those that have been distributed must also be given appropriate compensation, without any additional conditions. Therefore, according to Mr. Duan Ping's letter, if the district cadres refuse to return the shop on the grounds that "the village is operating this business and the interests of the village cannot be infringed; the stage is not right, if it was returned during the division of property, it could be returned," if this reflects the truth, then the district cadres are wrong, and they should conduct a good self-criticism and correct it quickly. The county party committee of the county should also quickly investigate and deal with it.　　——Editor

### 没收错了的小铺子不能借故不退

专栏：询问与答复

　　没收错了的小铺子不能借故不退编辑同志：
    我是深县西街关村人，民国三十一年在本城集股开了一个饼子房。除了零卖外，伪警备队常用小米来换饼子，就这样，慢慢地改为油醋铺。这铺子的家具都是借人家的，也没有雇工，大家都是伙友。作了二年，这买卖就发展的很不错，日本投降后还照常营业。但在复查斗争中，这买卖却给没收了；其原因是在我们六个股东中，有两个是伪属（但其他的股东多半是中农，还有贫农，都不够被斗的条件。）。这一闹使我很丧气，自己干了好几年，如今鸡飞蛋打，却落了一场空。后来听说咱政府保护工商业，心里非常高兴，但等到现在，我们铺子的事还没音讯。前几天我去找村干部，他们说村里开会没有什么意见，故到区里去讨论，但区里强调不能归还。因为：第一，这买卖村里还在做着，不能侵犯村里的利益；第二，阶段不对，如果是平分时斗的可以退回，否则概不归还。这可使我焦急了。我虽不了解政策，但借的家具别人催着要还，我们又还不起。到底这该怎么办呢？请编辑同志替我想个办法，给我一个答复。　　　　　　　（端平）
    答：
    我党的工商业政策原则是：除以四大家族为首的官僚资本以及汉奸、战犯的工商业应予没收外，其他所有正当工商业皆在政府保护之列。关于土改中侵犯的工商业亦早有指示，必须坚决纠正，已没收而尚未分散的应发还原主，已分散的亦须给予适当的补偿，并没有任何附加条件。因此，据端平君的来信说，区干部借“这个买卖村里在经营着，不能侵犯村里的利益；阶段也不对，如果是在平分的时候才可退还”的理由而不予退还，若这反映属实，则是区干部的不对，他们应好好地进行检讨，赶快纠正。该县县委亦应速加调查处理。　　——编者
