　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. According to reliable sources: Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek made various conspiracy arrangements before his "leaving office," including ordering Tang Enbo to defend Nanjing and Shanghai to the death, ordering Wu Guozhen to speed up the evacuation of materials from Shanghai, and implementing destruction when necessary. After seeing the statement of Chairman Mao Zedong of the CPC Central Committee on the 14th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek summoned more than ten other war criminals, including Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Peng Zhaoxian, Li Weiguo, Huang Shaoju, and Tao Xisheng, to discuss and decided not to reject "peace talks," but to use a "peace talk" posture to strive for a three-month extension to train 500,000 troops in the Jiangnan area. In addition, the meeting also decided that Chiang would maintain unified leadership over the "peace movement," and those under his leadership would be protected, while those not under Chiang's leadership would be authorized to the Kuomintang secret service agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, to impose "sanctions." In order to carry out the terrorist plan and the sabotage plan, the Kuomintang secret service agency has established fourteen secret "bombing teams," with secret service heads Liu Fangxiong and Zhang Shi as their responsible persons. On the 19th, the secret service agency carried out arrests in Shanghai. After the Nanjing Kuomintang government announced the abolition of the Special Criminal Court, the secret service agency decided to move important revolutionary political prisoners to South China and execute them in emergency situations. Chiang Kai-shek, who left Nanjing, is in fact still the supreme ruler of the Nanjing Kuomintang. On this point, a typical example is provided by the Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch of the 24th: Huang Shaoju, Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang Central Committee, requested to resign from the Standing Committee of the Party Central Committee, and the meeting "has agreed to forward it to the President for review and decision through the Secretariat as soon as possible." Another example is seen in the Associated Press Nanjing dispatch of the 22nd: Regarding the English translation of Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement" statement, "Zhang Qun telephoned Chiang Kai-shek in Fenghua, and Chiang loudly pointed out the corrections so that his voice could be heard."

　　匪首蒋介石“离职”前
  　曾作各种阴谋布置
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】据确息：匪首蒋介石在他“离职”以前曾进行了各种阴谋布置，包括令汤恩伯死守京沪，与令吴国桢加紧疏散上海物资，并在必要时实行破坏。在看到中共中央毛泽东主席本月十四日的声明以后，蒋介石曾召集其他战犯陈立夫、谷正纲、彭昭贤、李维果、黄少谷、陶希圣等十余人会商，决定不拒绝“和谈”，而以“和谈”姿态争取延长三个月时间，在江南练出五十万军队。此外，该会谈又决定由蒋保持对“和平运动”的统一领导，受领导者概予保护，不受蒋领导者授权国民党特务机关中央调查统计局予以“制裁”。为了执行恐怖计划与破坏计划，国民党特务机关已经成立了秘密组织“爆破队”十四个队，以特务头子刘芳雄、张师为其负责人。十九日，特务机关曾在上海实行逮捕。南京国民党政府宣布取消特种刑事法庭后，特务机关决定将重要革命政治犯迁往华南、并在情况紧急时予以枪杀。离开南京的蒋介石事实上仍然是南京国民党的最高统治者。在这一点上，国民党中央社南京二十四日电供给了一个典型的例子：国民党中央宣传部长黄少谷向该党中央常务委员会要求辞职，该会“已允由秘书处迅即转呈总裁核夺”。另一个例子见于美联社南京二十二日电：为了蒋介石“引退”文告的英译，“张群打电话给在奉化的蒋介石，蒋大声提出纠正之处，以便使他的声音能被听到”。
