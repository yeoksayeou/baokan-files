　　Neglecting Workers' Welfare Causes the Collapse of the Anguo City Trade Union

　　[Jizhong Electricity] The Anguo City Trade Union of various industries, due to its lax leadership, neglect of workers' welfare, and detachment from the worker masses, has finally collapsed. Since its establishment, the Anguo Trade Union, under the correct leadership of the General Trade Union, has implemented a reasonable wage system, appropriately improved labor-management relations, organized production competitions among workers, and participated in various social activities, achieving some success in improving workers' welfare. However, the city Trade Union later relaxed its leadership over lower-level trade unions, and the various trade unions became more and more lax. Some merchants and factory owners seized this opportunity to arbitrarily dismiss workers. For example, during the Gregorian New Year last year, Li Xianting, the director of the Chinese medicine cutting trade union, was a shop assistant at Maoji. Because he was active in trade union work, he was unreasonably dismissed by the shopkeeper. The Trade Union did not address this issue promptly, directly affecting the work of the Trade Union and the morale of the workers. The trade union cadres of the Chinese medicine cutting trade said, "The Trade Union is useless." The director of the Nanguan Trade Union said, "We raised the issue of Li Xianting's unemployment with the city Trade Union several times. The city Trade Union cadres only said they would study it and then talk about it, but then it was dragged on and nothing happened. Everyone in the Trade Union was discouraged.” According to the statistics in June: there were 675 trade union members in Chengguan, but most were nominal members. It was difficult to gather everyone for a workers' congress. For example, at the meeting to discuss the resolutions of the August Industry and Commerce Conference, more than 50 workers came the first time, but only five or six people attended the second time. The reasons for this phenomenon are: First, the municipal party committee and the municipal Trade Union had an insufficiently clear guiding ideology for workers' work. Most of the municipal cadres came from rural areas and lacked experience in urban work. Their leadership focused on rural areas and was weaker in leading industry and commerce. The Industry and Commerce Section and the Chamber of Commerce emphasized the interests of merchants and neglected the welfare of workers. Although the municipal party committee made two decisions to restore and improve the Trade Union, it did not establish it promptly, nor did it resolve some of the problems that arose in a timely manner. As a result, many workers and shop assistants lost faith in the Trade Union; they increased their fear of unemployment and dared not engage in appropriate reasoning and struggle against illegally exploitative capitalists. Second, some capitalists tried every means, both soft and hard, to deceive and exploit workers. For example, the manager of Yifeng Goods secretly said to the workers, "You can't do a good job, you will be fired if you join the Trade Union." Yongheyuan falsely claimed that business was bad and dismissed two workers (both trade union members). Zhang Dehua, a worker at Taifaxiang, was dismissed this spring because the manager was dissatisfied with him attending trade union meetings and took advantage of the fact that he was sick at home for two days. Some used the excuse of a mutual agreement not to stipulate wages. For example, some shopkeepers said, "We will give more wages and salaries if you sell more." However, when it came time to settle accounts, they always paid less wages or salaries. In addition, some workers and shop assistants had low levels of education and awareness. Some were relatives of the shop managers, who did not speak at meetings or said, "My relatives and friends are all good, there is nothing to say." This affected the consolidation of the Trade Union. Third, the organization of the trade unions of various industries was out of sync with the organization of the street branches. The city Trade Union had two general trade unions below it: Chengnan and Nanguan. Below the general trade unions, there were also trade unions for various industries, such as porter, carpentry, and iron trades. A separate branch was set up in the general trade union to lead the party members in the trade union, which formed an isolated trade union that did not receive assistance from other masses. In particular, the Trade Union itself did not provide sufficient in-depth leadership, focusing mostly on the cadres of the general trade union and neglecting to go deep into various industries to understand and solve problems among workers. In addition, some workers and shop assistants themselves also had some shortcomings. For example, the workers at Hexingchang Pharmacy did not work hard and often went to the streets to play, delaying working hours. Now, according to the spirit of the urban work conference and the industry and commerce conference convened by the district party committee and the administrative office, and in accordance with the specific conditions of the city, the Anguo Municipal Committee has decided to reorganize and restore the Trade Union, change the past organizational form of the Trade Union, abolish the names of the two general trade unions in Nanguan and Chengnan, and change them to trade unions based on streets. According to the specific conditions of each street, various industry groups will be divided and led by the Trade Union. Larger factories or public enterprises and porter trades will establish trade union organizations separately. In terms of the method of restoration, we will start with key points first, gain experience from them, and then establish various tasks universally.

### 忽视工人福利事业　安国市职工会垮台

　　忽视工人福利事业
  　安国市职工会垮台
    【冀中电】安国市行业职工会，放松领导，忽视工人福利，脱离工人群众，终于垮台。安国职工会自建立以来，在总工会的正确领导下，实行了合理的工资制度，适当改善了劳资关系，工人也开展过生产竞赛，并参加了各种社会活动，对工人福利的改进，是收到一些成绩的。因此后来市职工会放松了对下层职工会的领导，各个工会就一天一天的松懈下去。有些商人厂主抓住了这个空子，就任意解雇工人。如去年阳历年时，切药行工会主任李献廷，在茂记当伙计，因对工会工作积极，被掌柜无理解雇了。职工会对这一问题，没有抓紧解决，直接影响了职工会工作和职工的情绪。切药行的工会干部说：“在职工会没有用。”南关职工会主任说：“俺们为李献廷失业的问题，向市职工会提过好几次，市职工会干部只说研究研究再说，可是，后来就拉扯过去没事了，在职工会的人们谁也泄气。”据六月份的统计：城关共有职工会员六百七十五人，但大多数是有名无实。开一个工人大会，都召集不齐。如讨论八月工商会议决议的会上，第一次来了五十多个职工，第二次只去了五、六个人。造成这种现象的原因：一、市委和市职工会，对职工工作的领导思想不够明确。市干部多是来自农村，对城市工作缺乏经验，领导工作中偏重农村，对工商业领导较差。工商科和商会强调商人利益，忽视对工人福利的照顾。市委虽然作了两次恢复和健全职工会的决定，但没有抓紧建立起来，更没有及时解决发生的一些问题。因此很多工人、店员对职工会失去了信仰；增加了怕失业的思想顾虑，不敢向非法剥削的资方进行适当的说理斗争。二、有的资方想尽各种软硬办法，来愚弄剥削工人。如义丰货栈经理暗地对工人说：“你不好好干活不行，要入了工会就不用你了”。永和源假说买卖作不起，解雇了两个工人（都是工会会员）。泰发祥工人张德华，经理不满意他去工会开会，后来借他在家病了两天的机会，就在今年春天把他解雇了。有的借口双方约定，不规定工资。如有的掌柜说：“卖多就多给工资和薪水”。可是一到结帐时，总是少给工资或薪水。此外一部分工人、店员，因教育差，觉悟程度很低。有些是店铺经理的亲戚，开会不发言，或说：“亲戚朋友都不错，没什么说的”。这就影响了职工会的巩固。三、各业职工会的组织，和街支部的组织脱节。市职工会以下设城内、南关两个总工会。总工会下面，又设各行业工会，如脚行、木行、铁行等，在总工会里，单设一个支部领导职工会里的党员，这样就形成孤立的工会，得不到其他群众的帮助。特别是职工会本身领导不够深入，多是在总工会干部中打圈子，忽视深入各行业去了解和解决工人中的问题。此外有的工人、店员本身也存在一些毛病。如药行合兴昌的工人，不好好干活，常到街上去玩，耽误了做工的时间。现在安国市委根据区党委和行署召开的城市工作会议和工商会议精神，并按照本市的具体情况，决定把职工会再整顿恢复起来，改变过去职工会的组织形式，取消南关、城内两个总工会的名义，改为以街为单位的职工会，再根据各街具体情况，划分各种不同的行业小组，由职工会领导。比较大的工厂或公营企业和脚力行，单独建立职工组织。在恢复的方法上，先由重点做起，从中取得经验，然后再普遍建立各种工作。
