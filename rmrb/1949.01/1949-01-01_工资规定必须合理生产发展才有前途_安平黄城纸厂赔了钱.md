　　Wage Regulations Must Be Reasonable for Production Development to Have a Future
  　Anping Huangcheng Paper Mill Lost Money
    [Jizhong News] The Anping Huangcheng Paper Mill is jointly operated by a certain government organization and the Anping Promotion Cooperative. It has not made any money since August of last year. The reasons for not making money, in addition to improper management, also include unreasonable wage regulations, which is a major issue:
    (1) In terms of wage regulations, there is a tendency towards egalitarianism. Workers are not differentiated based on their skill level. They are only divided into wage grades according to the different nature of their work. All paper-making workers receive 210 jin of rice, hemp-washing workers receive 200 jin of rice, and paper-drying workers receive 190 jin of rice. The wages of apprentices and formal workers are similar. An apprentice named Zhai Changzhi, who has been learning for more than a year, earns 160 jin of rice per month, only 30 jin less than a paper-drying worker. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of the general workers is not high, and they often waste raw materials, resulting in a decrease in the quality of finished products. In the future, wages should be evaluated based on the workers' skills, labor efficiency, and other conditions to inspire the workers' enthusiasm and creativity. During the learning period, the wages of apprentices should also be appropriately reduced to lower production costs.
    (2) The amount of rice stipulated in the piece-rate progressive wage system is too high. In addition to the original fixed wages, there are also regulations for piece-rate bonuses: if each worker makes 50 sheets of paper more than the standard of 400 sheets per day, they will receive an extra 5 jin of rice; if they make 100 sheets more, they will be rewarded with 10 jin of rice, with a progressive increase of 2 jin; if they make 150 sheets more, they will be rewarded with 15 jin of rice, with a progressive increase of 4 jin; if they make 200 sheets more, they will be rewarded with 20 jin of rice, with another progressive increase of 8 jin. This progressive method is more expensive than the original cost when calculated. In summer, it is common to make 600 sheets (can make 700 sheets), so for the extra 200 sheets, there is an expense of 28 jin of rice, which is equivalent to 14 jin per hundred sheets. However, the expense for the standard output of 400 sheets is only 13 jin and 12 liang of rice per hundred sheets (excluding raw materials). If more is produced, the cost will increase. The last 50 sheets out of 600 sheets are equivalent to 13 jin of rice, and the bonus and progressive amount are twice the original production cost. This method is actually an unreasonable wage system and should be studied and corrected in the future. (Li Zhiming)

### 工资规定必须合理生产发展才有前途　安平黄城纸厂赔了钱

　　工资规定必须合理生产发展才有前途
  　安平黄城纸厂赔了钱
    【冀中讯】安平黄城纸厂是某机关和安平推进社共同经营起来的。自从去年八月以来，没有赚钱。没有赚钱的原因，除了经营管理的不当外，规定工资的不合理，也是一个主要问题：
    （一）工资规定上，存在着平均主义偏向，工人和工人之间，不分技术好坏，只按工作上的不同性质划分工资等级。凡抄纸工人二百一十斤米，洗麻工人二百斤米，晒纸工人一百九十斤米，学徒和正式工人的工资差不多，学徒一年多的翟常治，一月挣米一百六十斤，只比晒纸工人少三十斤。因此一般工人生产情绪不高，常浪费原料，使成品质量降低。今后应当根据工人的技术、劳动效率等条件来评定工资，启发工人的积极性和创造性。学徒在学习期间，工资也应适当减少，来减低生产成本。
    （二）超件累进工资制规定的米数过高，他们除了原定工资以外，并规定了超件奖励办法：每天每个工人抄四百张纸为标准，如果多抄五十张就多给米五斤；多抄一百张就奖励十斤米，累进二斤；多抄一百五十张，奖励十五斤米，累进四斤；多抄二百张，奖米二十斤，再累进八斤。这种累进办法，计算起来比原来成本还高，在夏天抄到六百张是平常产量（能抄七百张），这样多抄的二百张，须有二十八斤米的开支，每百张就合十四斤。可是标准产量四百张的开支，每百张只合米十三斤十二两（不算原料），假如多抄了成本还要提高。抄到六百张的最后五十张，合米十三斤，奖励和累进数比原产量开支相差一倍。这种办法，实际是不合理的工资制度，今后应当研究改正。（李志明）
