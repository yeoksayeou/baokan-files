Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Reports from various sources: The Indonesian people continue to resist the barbaric attacks of the Dutch invading forces. When Dutch paratroopers raided Yogyakarta, some communists and patriots detained by the Hatta government escaped during the chaos and returned to the guerrillas to participate in the resistance movement. The Madiun Radio Station announced on the 24th that the anti-war faction in the Indonesian government army was carrying out "unprecedentedly fierce resistance against the Dutch army" in central Java, and that "fighting continues around Yogyakarta, and the Dutch army dares not leave their barracks at night" (Associated Press). The railway connecting Central Java to Surabaya has been cut off. Dutch authorities admitted: "Indonesian guerrillas destroyed an express train from Batavia to Bandung on Christmas Day (25th)" (Associated Press). The Indonesian radio station in Sumatra declared: "When the Dutch army occupied Bukittinggi (the Indonesian capital on Sumatra Island), they suffered heavy casualties because major roads and bridges were heavily mined," and "fighting continues around Bukittinggi."

While the UN Security Council was discussing its acts of aggression, the Dutch invaders continued to occupy Solo, the second largest city in the Indonesian Republic, and Serang in West Java. Their ground forces also entered Yogyakarta. On the 25th, after the Security Council notified the Netherlands of a ceasefire order, the Dutch army continued its offensive in violation of the order, invading and occupying Madiun, the third largest city in the Indonesian Republic, Pandeglang in West Java (33 miles southwest of Batavia), Rangkasbitung, 10 miles east of Pandeglang, and Sibolga and Sidikalang in northern Sumatra. While intensifying their military offensive in an attempt to create a so-called "fait accompli," Dutch imperialism is also negotiating with the captured Indonesian traitor government leaders Hatta, Sukarno, and others, attempting to get them to form a new and more docile puppet government. Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker had already openly declared in his statement on the 19th: "Prime Minister Hatta of the Republic may still be asked to play a leading role in the future Republican government" (Agence France-Presse). American imperialism, which supports the Netherlands, is also involved. According to an Associated Press report on the 23rd: "The American delegation is trying behind the scenes to persuade the Netherlands to release the captured leaders of the Republic."

The Dutch government's shameless behavior has aroused increasing protests from the people at home and abroad. In The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, following the strike by dock and shipyard workers, many sailors have sailed their ships out of port to protest (Domei News Agency). A group of prominent Dutch artists, scientists, and philosophers also signed and published a letter of protest. On the 23rd, Australian dockworkers announced a boycott of all exports to Indonesia. The Australian Seamen's Union declared: "Members of the union will not operate Dutch ships docked in Australian ports." The All-India Port and Dock Workers Federation also called on Indian port and dock workers to boycott Dutch ships in Indian ports on the 25th. On the 24th, Indian students demonstrated in front of the Dutch embassy in Delhi, demanding a boycott of imperialist Holland.

　　印尼人民坚强抗击荷军
  　澳印海港工人拒为荷轮卸货
    【新华社陕北三十日电】各方报导：印尼人民继续抵抗荷兰侵略军的野蛮进攻。当荷军伞兵突袭日惹时，一部分被哈达政府拘捕的共产党人与爱国分子，已于混乱情况中脱狱，回到游击队，参加抵抗运动。茉莉芬电台二十四日曾宣布：印尼政府军中的抗战派正在爪哇中部“对荷军实行空前激烈的抵抗”，“日惹周围仍有战斗，荷军夜间均不敢出营房”（合众社）。爪哇中部通泗水的铁路，已被切断。荷方当局承认：“印尼游击队在圣诞节（二十五日）曾破坏了巴达维亚通万隆的快车一列”（合众社）。苏门答腊的印尼电台宣称：“荷军在占领布齐亭基（苏岛印尼首府）时，曾因主要公路上及桥梁下均埋有地雷而死伤甚重”，“布齐亭基周围仍有战事”。
    荷兰侵略者在安理会讨论其侵略行为期间，曾继续占领印尼共和国第二大城市梭罗及西爪哇的西冷城。其陆上部队亦进入日惹。二十五日，安理会以停战令通知荷兰后，荷军仍违令继续进攻，侵占印尼共和国第三大城茉莉芬、西爪哇的潘狄格朗（巴达维亚西南三十三哩）及其东十哩的兰加斯比吞与苏门答腊岛北部的实武呀、西狄加朗等城。荷帝国主义一方面加紧军事进攻，以图造成所谓“既成事实”，另一方面，正与被俘的印尼卖国政府首脑哈达、苏加诺等进行谈判，企图使他们出来组织新的更柔顺的傀儡政府。荷外长斯蒂克早在其十九日的声明中即公开宣称：“共和国总理哈达仍可能被请在未来的共和国政府中起领导作用”（法新社）。支持荷兰的美帝国主义亦参与其事，据美联社二十三日电透露：“美代表团正在幕后劝说荷兰释放被俘的共和国领袖”。
    荷政府的无耻行为已引起其国内外人民日益增长的抗议。在荷兰首府海牙，继码头与造船厂工人罢工后，许多海员已将他们的船驶出港外以示抗议（电通社）。荷兰一群著名的艺术家、科学家及哲学家亦签名发表抗议书。澳大利亚港口工人廿三日宣布抵制运往印尼的全部输出品。澳海员工会宣称：“该工会会员将不驾驶停在澳洲各港口的荷兰船只”。全印海港工人及码头工人联合会，亦于二十五日号召印度海港工人及码头工人不管在印度港内的荷兰船只。二十四日，印度学生曾在德里荷兰大使馆门前示威，要求抵制帝国主义的荷兰。
