　　Shijiazhuang Holds Flag Presentation Ceremony to See Off Six Hundred Youths Enlisting

[Our Newspaper] Shijiazhuang City held a flag presentation ceremony on the 29th of last month in Huaidi Village, Eighth District, to see off 600 outstanding youths from the city joining the field army. Comrade Wang Li, representative of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, earnestly pointed out: "You represent 200,000 people of Shijiazhuang in joining the people's revolutionary war at the front line. You must study hard, quickly learn combat skills, and accelerate and shorten the days of victory. You work hard to kill the enemy at the front, and we work hard to produce in the rear." Then, Comrade Liu Jin, representative of the municipal government, delivered a farewell speech, saying: "The glorious task is at the front line. After you leave, the municipal government will alleviate the difficulties of your families to comfort you. The problems of your families are the problems of the municipal government. The municipal government guarantees: First, military families will be able to eat dumplings during the Lunar New Year. Second, we will organize military families to engage in production so that they have work and food. Third, there will be a substitute cultivation method for the land after you leave. Fourth, for families with special difficulties and no labor force, we will adopt a method of material subsidies, and we will use these as gifts to send everyone off.” The new soldiers, with impassioned emotion, rushed to the stage to deliver a response: "We will not return home until we defeat the Chiang Kai-shek bandits! We will learn more skills, kill more enemies, strive to be models, and perform meritorious service for the people!" Finally, representatives from various units presented flags to the new soldiers. The new soldiers, holding up one red flag after another, dispersed in a series of cheers of "Comrades, going to the front line is the most glorious! Study hard, strive to be models in learning, and strive to be heroes on the front line!" (Li Jialing)
