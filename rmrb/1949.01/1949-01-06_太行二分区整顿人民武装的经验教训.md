　　Experiences and Lessons from the Rectification of People's Armed Forces in the Taihang Second Military Sub-district
    Li Guicheng
    Starting from November, about 86% of the 1,110 administrative villages in the Second Military Sub-district, in conjunction with the central tasks, began to rectify and build the People's Armed Forces and conducted a relatively widespread ideological mobilization. Among them, 191 villages (excluding Xiangyuan) performed better, and in addition to rectifying the organization, they also resolved some of the pacifist and apathetic ideas among the masses. Most have now turned to winter self-training. According to incomplete statistics from Xiyang, Heshun, Yushe, and Wuxiang, after ideological education and organizational rectification, the organizations of 962 militiamen from wrongly labeled middle peasant backgrounds have been restored, and another 382 young adults have newly joined the militia, overcoming the chaotic situation and disorganized, anarchic state in the rural areas during the first half of the year, and social order has been stabilized. In 20 days, Wuxiang's Seventh District uncovered four cases. However, the above achievements are limited to some areas, and two-thirds of the villages have not done well. In the first phase of rectification, only personnel and weapons were registered. Most of the militiamen from wrongly labeled middle peasant backgrounds have not been corrected, and many ideological problems have not been resolved. In addition, 14% of the villages have not even started at all, and the work of the People's Armed Forces is in a state of self-flow and stagnation. The situation in these three types of villages has pointed out that we must continue to work hard to complete the task of rectifying and building the People's Armed Forces this winter and spring.
    The main reasons why the 191 administrative villages did better are: (1) The work of the People's Armed Forces was closely integrated with the central tasks. Not only was it studied and implemented in a unified manner at certain meetings, but also specific ways to combine the two were discussed based on the actual situation. Many villages in Wuxiang's Seventh District first deeply mobilized the Party members and non-Party members with the plan of armed work, and then combined and carried out the work according to the different steps of the central task. When publicizing the Party's policies and compensating wrongly labeled middle peasants, they simultaneously corrected the deviation of expelling militiamen from wrongly labeled middle peasant backgrounds. In Xiyang, during the rectification of the peasant associations, the militia armed forces were also rectified at the same time. Education on the mutual relationship was conducted, and under mutual promotion, both the peasant associations and the militia were developed and consolidated. (2) Thoroughly implement ideological education for the People's Armed Forces and carry out organizational rectification. First, combine current affairs and future education with recalling the history of the People's Armed Forces' struggle and future tasks, as well as the lessons learned from the losses suffered after the slackness in the first half of the year. After doing this in villages like Humanling and Anbei in Wuxiang, the political awareness of the militiamen and self-defense forces was improved, and they deeply realized that "it won't work without armed forces in the future," overcoming pacifist and apathetic ideas. Forty-three young people consciously joined the militia. At the same time, the propaganda and education of the land reform policy and the People's Armed Forces policy should be strengthened to correct the past left-leaning errors of excluding middle peasant militiamen. In conjunction with appropriate leadership review, restore the organization of militiamen from wrongly labeled middle peasant backgrounds. The fourteen middle peasant militiamen expelled from Huitong Village in Wuxiang last winter and spring have been completely approved to restore their organization. (3) "The work of a village lies in the village." Therefore, in-depth inspection and specific assistance to village cadres is one of the keys to success or failure. Not only should the work be deployed, but also timely in-depth inspections should be carried out. Based on the specific situation, the original plan should be revised, and village cadres should be continuously helped to clarify the problems ideologically, think of solutions, and specifically lead the implementation of the plan. Wuxiang's Seventh District and Xiyang's Fifth District have successively held large-scale summary meetings, small-scale base point meetings, or held irregular special forums with some village cadres to study and exchange experiences and specific guidance, which gave the village cadres high confidence.
    Why has the rectification and construction work of the People's Armed Forces not been fully launched? The main reasons are: (1) Leaders at all levels of the Armed Forces Department (including the sub-district Armed Forces Committee) have serious shortcomings in their work style. At the beginning, the expanded meetings of armed cadres convened at all levels focused on solving ideological problems, but were not thorough enough in implementing the plan and arrangements for completing work tasks, and did not formulate plans based on the different types of villages and different situations. Some counties "copied" the original plan of the sub-district Armed Forces verbatim, which the village cadres could not accept, and the work was at a loss. In addition, there was more deployment and less inspection, and deviations could not be corrected in a timely manner. Many comrades in the county Armed Forces (County People's Armed Forces Committee) leadership did not understand the overall situation of the local work, and at the same time, the reporting system to the higher levels was not implemented as required. (2) The issue of integrating the work of the People's Armed Forces with the central tasks has not been well resolved in most areas. On the one hand, some armed cadres mistakenly believe that the Party's unified leadership and the People's Armed Forces departments' leadership are parallel relationships, and detach a certain amount of manpower and time from the central tasks to simply engage in departmental work. On the other hand, in recent months, under the Party's unified leadership, departmental work has achieved great results, but in the county and district leadership, the instructions of the North China Bureau and the North China Armed Forces Department on rectifying the People's Armed Forces have not been well studied and guided for implementation. Individual leading comrades still have incorrect understandings of the construction of the People's Armed Forces.

　　太行二分区整顿人民武装的经验教训
    李贵成
    从十一月份起，二分区一千一百一十个行政村，约有百分之八十六的村庄，结合中心工作，开始着手整顿与建设人民武装，进行了较普遍的思想动员。其中一百九十一个村作的较好（缺襄垣），除整顿组织外，并解决了群众中一部分太平麻痹等思想问题，现大部已转向冬季自练。据昔阳、和顺、榆社、武乡不完全统计，经过思想教育与组织整顿，已有九百六十二个错斗中农成份的民兵恢复组织，另有三百八十二个青壮年新参加民兵，克服了前半年农村中混乱局面和无组织无政府状态，社会秩序安定。武乡七区二十天查获四起案件。但上述成绩仅限于部分地区，还有三分之二的村庄未搞好，第一步整顿工作中只作了人员武器的登记，对错斗中农成份民兵大部未纠正，不少思想问题未解决。另有百分之十四的村庄还根本未搞，人民武装工作均陷于自流停顿状态。这三种类型村的情况，已给我们指出了必须继续努力，才能在今冬明春完成人民武装整顿与建设的任务。
    一百九十一个行政村做得较好的原因，主要是：（一）人民武装工作与中心工作紧密结合，不仅在一定会议上统一研究贯彻，还依据实际情况，讨论了具体结合进行的办法。武乡七区不少村首先把武装工作的计划在党内外深入动员后，即按照中心工作不同的步骤结合进行。在宣传党的政策与补偿错斗中农时，即协力同时纠正开除错斗中农成份民兵的偏向，昔阳在整顿农会中，同时整顿民兵武装，都进行了相互关系的教育，在相互推动下，农会民兵均得到发展与巩固。（二）深入贯彻人民武装的思想教育，进行组织整顿。首先将时事，前途教育，与回忆人民武装斗争历史及今后任务和前半年松懈后受损失的教训相结合进行教育。武乡胡蛮岭、岸北这样作后，民兵自卫队政治觉悟提高，深刻认识了“今后没有武装就不行”，克服了太平麻痹思想，四十三个青年自觉参加民兵。同时，应加强土改政策与人民武装政策宣传教育，纠正过去排斥中农民兵的左倾错误，结合领导上适当检讨恢复错斗中农成份民兵的组织。武乡会同村去冬今春开除的十四个中农民兵已完全批准恢复组织。（三）“一村工作在于村”，因此，深入检查具体帮助村干，是成败的关键之一。不仅把工作布置下去，还应及时深入检查，根据具体情况修正原来计划，不断帮助村干从思想上明确问题，想办法，具体领导其实现计划。武乡七区、昔阳五区均先后召开了大型的总结会，小型的基点会，或不定期专门找一些村干座谈研究，上下相互交流经验具体指导，村干信心很高。
    为什么人民武装整顿与建设工作未能全面展开呢？主要是：（一）武装部各级领导（分区武委会亦在内）作风上，均存在着严重缺点。开始各级召开的扩大武装干部会，重点只放在解决思想问题，而对完成工作任务的计划和安排深入贯澈却不够，没根据不同类型村不同情况去订计划。有的县照分武计划原文“搬”下去，村干接受不了，工作束手无策。另外，布置多，检查少，偏向不能及时纠正。不少县武（县人民武装委员会）领导同志不了解当地工作全面情况，同时，向上级的汇报制度亦未能按规定执行。（二）人民武装工作与中心工作结合的问题在大部地区仍未很好解决。一方面有些武装干部错认为党的统一领导与人民武装部门领导是平列关系，并脱离中心工作抽一定力量一定时间单纯搞部门工作。另一方面，近几个月来在党的统一领导下，部门工作已获得很大成绩，但是在县区领导上，对华北局与华北武装部整顿人民武装的指示，没有很好做过研究，加以指导贯彻。个别领导同志还对人民武装建设工作存在有不正确的认识。
