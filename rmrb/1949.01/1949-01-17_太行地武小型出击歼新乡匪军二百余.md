The Taihang Military Region's Local Armed Forces Launch Small Attacks, Annihilating Over 200 Bandit Troops in Xinxiang

(Taihang, 12th) Around the New Year, the local armed forces of the 4th and 5th Military Sub-districts on both sides of the Daokou-Qinghua and Pinghan Railways in northern Henan launched several small-scale attacks against enemy organizations around Xinxiang city, achieving successive victories. In five battles, they eliminated over 200 enemies, dealing a severe blow to the enemy troops who were looting grain. On the morning of the 22nd of last month, a portion of our 5th Military Sub-district's local army, combined with the Jixian Battalion, ambushed the bandit Wang Sanzhu's 2nd Regiment, one squad, and the adjutant Zhang Guangxin's entire force of the 3rd Regiment, who had been harassing the Changcun and Shiwa areas southeast of Xinxiang, capturing them all. On the 26th, a portion of the enemy's 40th Army stationed in Gao Village outside Xinxiang, along with over 1,000 bandits, invaded the Hehe area of Yuanfeng to loot grain. A portion of our 4th Military Sub-district's local army launched a two-pronged attack, causing the bandits to flee in panic. In the pursuit, we killed and wounded 27 enemies. On the 28th, our Jixian Battalion ambushed Dudi and Jiaozhuang northeast of Xinxiang, completely wiping out the 1st and 2nd Squadrons and the Assault Team of the Qi County Security Regiment that had invaded the area, killing over 30 bandits. On the 29th, our Huixian Independent Regiment ambushed the 5th Squadron of the Huixian Security Regiment, who were attempting to loot grain from our Zhao Jingtun, capturing the acting squadron leader and 24 others, and killing and wounding four. We seized two light machine guns. On the 3rd of this month, over 3,500 men from the Kuomintang 40th Army's 317th Regiment, 115th Regiment, 25th Replenishment Regiment, and 12th Pacification Zone Service Battalion invaded the western and northern areas of Huixian City, looting grain on a large scale. On the 5th, the bandit troops infiltrated our hinterland of Yuhe Town. A certain unit of our local army immediately cut off the enemy's waist in the areas of Nantan and Mazhang. The enemy fled in panic, and we intercepted them along the way, killing and wounding over 80 enemies. Our army also rushed to Mazhangtun in one go, wiping out most of the 4th Company and transportation platoon of the 2nd Battalion of the enemy's 115th Regiment. Seven men from the small artillery squad of the 1st Battalion of the enemy's 317th Regiment surrendered to us while fleeing. In total, in the five battles on December 22nd, 26th, 28th, and 29th of last year, and the 7th of this month, we killed and wounded 116 enemies, captured 105 enemies, and seized one heavy machine gun, three light machine guns, 65 rifles and pistols, and some ammunition. The 13 large carts of civilian grain that were looted by the enemy during the battles on the 26th and 27th have also been returned to the local masses.
