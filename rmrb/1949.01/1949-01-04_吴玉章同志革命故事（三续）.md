　　Revolutionary Stories of Comrade Wu Yuzhang (Continued 3)
    He Qifang
  　Unwilling to be an Official
    In January of the first year of the Republic of China, the Sichuan Military Government sent Comrade Wu Yuzhang and Yang Shukan to Nanjing as representatives of Sichuan. By the time they arrived, the Provisional Government had already been established. Ju Zheng, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, and Tian Tong, the Secretary-General, said to him as soon as they met, "It's a pity you're late. All the positions of Vice Minister are already taken. You can choose a Director or Counselor in the Ministry of Interior." Comrade Wu Yuzhang said, "Our revolution is not for the sake of becoming officials; please don't mention this." But then they still sent him the appointment letter for the Director of the Land Bureau (Jiangli Bureau). Comrade Wu Yuzhang returned it. They then sent him the appointment letter for Counselor, but he still returned it.

    Later, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted him to help with work in the Presidential Office Secretariat, he accepted the position of General Affairs Section in the Secretariat. At this time, it was the end of January, just when the North-South peace talks were about to be concluded. Obviously, once the peace talks were concluded, the Presidential Office Secretariat would be abolished. Therefore, many people initially tried to get into the Secretariat, but at this time, everyone was unwilling to work in the Secretariat. Many people were looking for other opportunities, and some even went to Yuan Shikai's side to find positions, such as Cheng Mingchao. He was an old bureaucrat who had obtained a high position in the Secretariat but was not coming to work and was eager to leave. Only Comrade Wu Yuzhang diligently supported this remnant.

    After the North-South peace talks were concluded, the two military governments of Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan were still opposed to each other. Yuan Shikai asked someone to tell Comrade Wu Yuzhang that he wanted him to go to Sichuan as an envoy to mediate. Comrade Wu Yuzhang replied, "I will not be an official; and how can I use the title of envoy to my fellow villagers?" Later, Yuan Shikai had to follow Comrade Wu Yuzhang's suggestion and did not use any official title, but only sent him to Sichuan for consolation by the government. Comrade Wu Yuzhang then returned to Sichuan with Zhu Fuhuang. After returning, someone asked him, "Judging from the fact that the governor and all the city officials greeted you ten miles outside the city, you seem to be imperial envoys. But judging from your light carriage and simple entourage, and your warm conversations and speeches with the common people everywhere, you seem to be missionaries. What kind of officials are you after all?" Comrade Wu Yuzhang said, "We are not officials, we are revolutionaries. We want to persuade the people to cut their queues, not to smoke opium, not to gamble, not to bind their feet, to read and write, to run schools, and to study abroad. We have established a Franco-Study Economy Society, so ambitious young people can go to France to study with very little money."

    The result of Comrade Wu Yuzhang's return to Sichuan this time, in addition to promoting cooperation between Chengdu and Chongqing, was indeed sending dozens of students to France. Later, the Franco-Study Economy Society developed into the Work-Study Society, which allowed people to go to France for work-study with only one hundred dollars. Several thousand people from Sichuan, Hunan, Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces went to France through the Work-Study Society. Among these people were those who later became famous Communists, such as Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Wang Ruofei, Comrade Chen Yi, Comrade Nie Rongzhen, Comrade Li Fuchun, and Comrade Zhao Shiyan and Comrade Chen Yannian, who have already heroically sacrificed.

    Around the Second Revolution
    After the Xinhai Revolution, the Tongmenghui began to disintegrate. Some wanted to realize European and American parliamentary politics, and some advocated anarchism. Zhang Taiyan chanted "When the revolutionary army rises, the revolutionary party disappears," supporting Li Yuanhong to oppose Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and Wang Jingwei, bought by Yuan Shikai, forced Mr. Sun Yat-sen to negotiate peace with Yuan. Mr. Sun Yat-sen initially did not want to make peace. Wang Jingwei said, "Are you reluctant to give up the presidency?" Mr. Sun Yat-sen could no longer insist on his own opinion.

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen had always been very good to Comrade Wu Yuzhang, believing that he was loyal, knew the general situation, and had long-term plans. In April of the second year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai assassinated Song Jiaoren and borrowed 250 million foreign debts without the consent of the National Assembly, and used money to buy off members of parliament. At the same time, news that he was going to dismiss the governors of the four provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan, who belonged to the Kuomintang, was also spreading rapidly. Comrade Wu Yuzhang suggested to Mr. Sun Yat-sen at this time, advocating that the four governors jointly send a telegram to oppose Yuan Shikai's illegal actions, and declare that they would not accept the orders of the illegal government until a legitimate cabinet was established, thus preempting him. Mr. Sun Yat-sen agreed, but Huang Xing disagreed. After Yuan Shikai issued the order to dismiss the four governors, Li Liejun delayed for a long time before launching an uprising in Hukou, so that the army was not justified, and the so-called Second Revolution completely failed in less than three months.

    In April of this year, when the National Assembly opened, Yuan Shikai spent a lot of money to buy off members of parliament, so that the Kuomintang, which had a majority of members, could not elect a speaker. In the process of the election struggle, the Kuomintang also used some money to buy off votes. Comrade Wu Yuzhang strongly opposed this after he found out. He said to the Kuomintang people who were handling this matter at the time, "We don't have as much money as Yuan Shikai; rather than using money to buy off votes and failing, it is better not to use a penny to maintain justice. If we use money to buy off members of parliament at the beginning of our democratic system, democratic politics will completely collapse." They did not listen to Comrade Wu Yuzhang's words, and as a result, they spent two or three hundred thousand, but still did not win the speaker.

    From these things, we can see that Comrade Wu Yuzhang was very farsighted and adhered to principles.

    After the failure of the Second Revolution, Comrade Wu Yuzhang was still running around in Shanghai, carrying out activities against Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai's newspaper said that the Chongqing uprising of Xiong Kewu was instigated by him, so Yuan ordered his arrest. Many party members advised him to go abroad, and they prepared the procedures and bought the boat tickets for him. Comrade Wu Yuzhang then went to Paris, France, in the winter of 1913.

    Advising Mr. Sun Yat-sen not to separate from the masses

    When studying in Japan, Comrade Wu Yuzhang studied electrical engineering, but he was engaged in politics every day. So after arriving in Paris, he changed to the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris to study political economy. In these years, he was still carrying out activities against Yuan Shikai abroad. In June 1916, Yuan Shikai died. In October, he returned to China with Cai Yuanpei.

    In 1918, Yang Yongtai of the Political Science Society and Mo Rongxin, a Guangxi warlord, designed to overthrow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's military government as the Grand Marshal, and changed it to the Guangdong military government of seven presidents. In order to falsely use Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary name, although they supported Cen Chunxuan as the leader, they still had to give a president's position to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. When this military government was established, Comrade Wu Yuzhang happened to be a representative of Sichuan and also participated in the political affairs meeting in Guangdong. Because Comrade Wu Yuzhang had always been trusted by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, they wanted him to go to Shanghai to persuade Mr. Sun Yat-sen to take office. When he arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was lying in bed. He recounted the course and true situation of these events. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very indignant and said, "I don't want to associate with them!" Comrade Wu Yuzhang advised him, "We revolutionaries cannot separate from the masses, nor can we separate from political activities. Now they have no choice but to reluctantly cooperate with you. If you refuse, they can still deceive the masses under the banner of protecting the constitution. So you should still cooperate with them to show your determination to make compromises and unite against the Northern Warlords. Don't think that Cen Chunxuan is so powerful today; if he doesn't do well, he will collapse soon, and I'm afraid his situation will be a hundred times worse than Mr. Sun's today." Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very moved after listening, and tears welled up in his eyes, saying, "I will listen to you and send Jingwei as a representative." At that time, the only military force left to Mr. Sun Yat-sen was Chen Jiongming's troops, who were being squeezed out in Zhangzhou. Cen Chunxuan, Mo Rongxin, and the others tried every means to limit him and eliminate him. Comrade Wu Yuzhang always fought with them in the meetings of the military government, and finally preserved this strength for Mr. Sun Yat-sen's return to Guangdong in the future.

　　吴玉章同志革命故事（三续）
    何其芳
  　不愿做官
    民国元年正月，蜀军政府派吴玉章同志和杨庶堪为四川代表，到南京去。到时，临时政府已成立。内务部次长居正和秘书长田桐一见到他就说：“可惜你来迟了，各部次长位置已经没有了。内务部的司长参事随你选择一个。”吴玉章同志说：“我们革命不是为做官；请你们不要提这个。”但接着他们还是送了疆理局（即土地局）局长的任命状来。吴玉章同志退了回去。他们又送参事的任命状来，又还是退了回去。
    从来孙中山先生要他在总统府秘书处帮助工作，他才接受了秘书处总务科的职务。这时已是正月底，正是南北和议将成的时候。很明显地，和议一成，总统府秘书处就要取消的。因此开头秘书处很多人来钻营，而这时却大家都不愿来秘书处做事。许多人都在另寻出路，甚至已有到袁世凯方面去找位置的人了，如程明超就是一个。他是一个旧官僚，原来在秘书处得了一个高位置，这时却不来办事而急想离开。只有吴玉章同志却勤勤恳恳地支持这一残局。
    南北和议成后，四川的成渝两个军政府还是对立着。袁世凯托人向吴玉章同志说，要他作宣慰使到四川去调停。吴玉章同志回答说：“我不作官；而且对故乡父老怎么可以用什么宣慰使的名义？后来袁世凯只有依照吴玉章同志的意见，不用任何官职名义,只是由政府派往四川慰问。吴玉章同志才和朱芾煌一起回川。回来后，有人问他：“从都督和全城官员郊迎十里来看，你们好象是钦差大臣。但从你们轻车简从，到处亲切地和老百姓谈话、讲演来看，你们又象是传道师。你们到底是什么官？”吴玉章同志说：“我们不是官，是革命者。我们要劝老百姓剪辫子，不吃鸦片，不赌钱，不缠足，要读书识字，要办学校，要到外国留学。我们办了一个留法俭学会，有志青年用很少的钱就可以到法国去留学。”
    吴玉章同志这一次回川的结果，除了促成成渝合作外，并果然送了几十个学生到法国去。后来留法俭学会发展为勤工俭学会，只要一百块钱就可以到法国半工半读。四川、湖南、广东、河北、江浙及其他各省前后以勤工俭学会到法国的有几千人。这些人中，有后来成为有名的共产党人的，如周恩来同志，王若飞同志，陈毅同志，聂荣臻同志，李富春同志和已经英勇牺牲了的赵世炎、陈延年等同志。
    二次革命前后
    辛亥革命后，同盟会就开始分化了。有的想实现欧美议会政治，有的主张无政府主义。章太炎高唱“革命军起，革命党消”，拥护黎元洪来反对孙中山先生，汪精卫受了袁世凯的收买，强迫孙中山先生与袁议和。孙中山初不愿和。汪精卫说：“你舍不得总统吗？”孙中山先生就不好再坚持己见了。
    孙中山先生素来都对吴玉章同志很好，认为他忠实而又识大体，有远谋。民国二年四月，袁世凯暗杀了宋教仁，又不经国会同意就借了二万万五千万外债，并用钱收买议员。同时，他要取消国民党粤赣皖湘四省都督的消息也传说得很厉害。吴玉章同志这时就向孙中山先生建议，主张四都督联合通电反对袁世凯的违法，并声明在合法内阁未成立以前不能受违法政府的命令，这样来先发制人。孙中山先生赞成，而黄兴却不同意。等到袁世凯免四都督职的命令发表后，迟延了许久李烈钧才在湖口起义，以至师出无名，所谓二次革命不到三个月即完全失败。
    这年四月，国会开幕时，袁世凯花了许多金钱来收买议员，以至国民党拥有大多数议员都不能选出一个议长。在选举斗争的过程中，国民党也用一些金钱来收买。吴玉章同志知道后非常反对。他向当时办这类事情的国民党人说：“我们的金钱没有袁世凯多；与其用钱收买而失败，不如不用一钱以保持正义。如果我们初行民主制度即用金钱收买议员，民主政治就根本垮台了。”他们不听吴玉章同志的话，结果花了二三十万，议长仍是没有争到。
    这些，都可以看到吴玉章同志很有远见，而且坚持原则。
    二次革命失败后，吴玉章同志仍在上海各处奔走，进行反对袁世凯的活动。袁世凯的机关报上说重庆熊克武起义是他策动的，于是袁就下令通缉他。许多党人都劝他出国，并为他办好手续，买好船票。吴玉章同志遂于一九一三年冬天去法国巴黎。
    劝孙中山先生不要脱离群众
    在日本留学时，吴玉章同志是学的电气工业，而他天天从事的又都是政治。所以到巴黎后，他就改入巴黎法科大学，研究政治经济。这几年，他仍在国外进行反对袁世凯的活动。一九一六年六月，袁世凯死了。十月，他和蔡元培一起回国。
    一九一八年，政学会杨永泰等与广西军阀莫荣新设计推倒孙中山先生为大元帅的军政府，而改为七总裁的广东军政府。他们为了假借孙中山先生的革命名义，虽拥岑春煊为首但仍不能不分一总裁的位置给孙中山先生。这个军政府成立时。吴玉章同志适为四川代表，也在广东参加政务会议。他们因为吴玉章同志向来为孙中山先生所信任。就要他到上海去劝孙中山先生就职。到上海时，孙中山先生正卧病床上。他叙述了这些事情的经过和真实情形，孙中山先生非常愤慨地说：“我不愿与他们为伍！”吴玉章同志劝他说：“我们作革命运动的人不能脱离群众，也不能脱离政治活动。现在他们不得已，勉强和你合作。如果你拒绝，他们还是可以假借护法的招牌欺骗群众。所以你还是和他们合作，以表示委曲求全，联合反对北洋军阀的苦心。不要看岑春煊今天煊赫一时，他不好好作去，不久就会垮台，恐怕他那时还要比先生今日的处境坏一百倍。”孙中山先生听了很感动，以至流出了眼泪说：“我听你的话，派精卫去作代表。”当时孙中山先生仅存的武力只有被排挤在漳州的陈炯明的队伍。岑春煊、莫荣新他们还千方百计地想限制他，消灭他。吴玉章同志在军政府的会议，总是和他们力争，终于保存了这点实力，为以后孙中山先生回广东之用。
