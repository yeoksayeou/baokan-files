　　After the North China Bureau issued the decision on strengthening on-the-job cadre education, the county committees of Yu County, Shouyang, Pingding, and Wutai in the first district of Jinzhong, and Xugou, Taiyuan, Qingyuan, and Xiaoyi in the second district, all held cadre study mobilization meetings. They reviewed the past cadre studies and, based on the instructions of the North China Bureau, formulated study plans. Pingding County conducted a cadre test in October, which stimulated the enthusiasm of cadres to study for a time, but it failed to persist due to the lack of specific leadership. On November 4th, the county committee held another cadre study mobilization meeting for more than 60 county and district cadres. Comrade Ge Yisheng, the county secretary, emphasized the importance of study and reviewed the past studies. He said: In the past, the county committee itself believed that studying "theory is too lofty and doctrinaire, and it is better to do more practical work"; similarly, most cadres did not pay attention to study, thinking that it was "not as important as work," and that "it is okay not to study, but it is not okay to delay work," regarding study as a sideline, or even as a burden. Xin County's county-level agencies spent three days reviewing past cadre studies, criticizing the old-fashioned empiricism in cadre studies and various incorrect ideas about study. For example, some cadres believed that "it's the same whether you study or not," and some even had the mistaken idea that they were "afraid of being transferred to work outside the local area if they studied well." In addition to holding mobilization meetings, Shouyang and Wutai counties also conducted study tests to promote cadre study. From the tests in the two counties, it can be seen that the general cadres' level of political theory is very low. For example, many cadres in Wutai County did not know what the general line and general policy of land reform were; a certain county committee in Shouyang County could not even answer the Party's general line and general policy at the current stage. After mobilization, the counties first made plans for future studies, reorganized study organizations, and established study committees in counties and districts, stipulating various study systems. Shouyang, Pingding, and Xin Counties have all made longer-term plans, dividing different groups according to political theory and cultural level, studying different documents and courses. Those with reading ability mainly study on their own, and those who cannot study on their own take the form of responsible cadres giving lectures. The party members' congresses were convened in the various agencies of Xiaoyi County in the second district to re-elect the party branches to more effectively strengthen leadership in study. The Qingyuan County Committee decided to start a cadre training class attached to Qingyuan Middle School from December 25th of last year, to first strengthen the study of cadres in the town. All counties emphasize that responsible cadres should lead by example in leading the study. In terms of learning methods, they also strive to be lively and effective, overcoming the old-fashioned fixed learning methods of reading documents, discussing, and reflecting in the past.

　　晋中各县县区干部
  　开始自觉进行学习
    自华北局发出关于加强在职干部教育的决定后，晋中一分区的盂县、寿阳、平定、五台，二分区的徐沟、太原，清源、孝义等县县委，均召开了干部学习动员大会，检讨了过去干部学习，并根据华北局的指示，订出学习计划。平定县在十月份曾举行过一次干部测验，一度刺激起干部学习的热情，但由于领导上未抓紧进行具体领导。致未能坚持下去。十一月四日，县委又召开了县区干部六十余人的干部学习动员大会，县书葛宜生同志着重说明了学习的重要性，并检讨了过去的学习。他说：过去县委本身就认为学习“理论是好高鹜远，教条主义，不如多作点实际工作”；同样的，多数干部对学习不重视，认为“不如工作重要”，“不学习能行，耽误下工作就不行”，把学习看成捎带的，甚至有的看成是负担。忻县县级各机关，专抽三天时间检讨过去的干部学习，批判了过去干部学习上老一套的经验主义，与对学习的各种不正确思想。如有的干部认为“学不学一样”，有的还认为“怕学好了调离本地工作”的错误思想。寿阳、五台县除召开动员会外，并进行学习测验，推动了干部学习。从两县的测验中，可以看出一般干部的政治理论水平是很低的，如五台县不少干部，不知道土地改革的总路线总政策是什么；寿阳县某一县委连党在现阶段的总路线总政策也答不出。各县经过动员后，首先作了今后的学习计划，整顿了学习组织，县区均成立了学习委员会，规定了各种学习制度。寿阳、平定、忻县均作了较长远的计划，按政治理论文化程度划分不同小组，学习不同的文件课程，有阅读能力者以自学为主，不能自学者采取负责干部上课的方式。二分区孝义县各机关召开党员大会，重新选举党的支部，更有力的加强领导学习。清源县委决定从去年十二月二十五日开始，在清源中学附设干部补习班，首先加强城关干部的学习。各县在领导学习中，均强调负责干部以身作则，带头学习。在学习方法上，也力求活泼有效、克服过去老一套看文件，讨论、反省的固定学习方法。
