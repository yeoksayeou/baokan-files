Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 13th—Details of the war criminal Du Yuming's command of American-made Chiang aircraft to release poison on several occasions from the 7th to the 9th are as follows after investigation: At 12:00 noon on the 7th, Chiang aircraft dropped six tear gas bombs in Xiedianzi, northeast of Yongcheng, five of which exploded, and one did not explode. The area affected by the poisonous gas was 300 meters long and 100 meters wide. More than 90 soldiers and civilians were poisoned. Farmer Wu ＠min was injured by the explosion, and his son was killed. The rest of the poisoned people recovered after being treated by the People's Liberation Army. The unexploded tear gas bomb was about two feet long and 20 centimeters in diameter. The bomb body was gray, surrounded by a green hoop, with eight green dots. At 1:00 p.m. on the same day, an American-made light bomber flew low over the People's Liberation Army's Dashengying position and dropped seven tear gas bombs. Because the People's Liberation Army was prepared, no one was poisoned; more than 500 villagers in the village were poisoned. The People's Liberation Army led the villagers to leave the contaminated area and helped with treatment. Those with mild poisoning recovered after ten minutes. At 10:00 a.m. on the 9th, American-made enemy aircraft again dropped two tear gas bombs on the People's Liberation Army's Tanglou position. Ten soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were poisoned, and twenty-five villagers in Zhaizhuang and Tanglou were poisoned. Tang Chengxian's family of twelve in Tanglou were all poisoned. After the People's Liberation Army's emergency treatment, they also recovered one after another.
