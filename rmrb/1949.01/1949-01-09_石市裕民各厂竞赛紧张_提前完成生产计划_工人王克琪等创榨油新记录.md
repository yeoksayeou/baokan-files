　　Shijiazhuang News: Under the intense atmosphere of revolutionary competition and production challenges, various factories of the Shijiazhuang Yumin Industrial Company have successively completed their production plans for increasing production and making up for losses. Due to the active efforts of all employees, the company's two flour mills, the Second Flour Mill, which had a plan to produce 20,000 bags of flour from November 15th to December 31st of the previous year, completed it two days ahead of schedule on the 29th of last month, and produced an additional 185 bags of flour. In addition to this, they also helped the First Flour Mill to re-grind 10,000 jin of flour. The First Flour Mill's task of increasing production and making up for losses of 25,000 bags of flour in two months is now less than halfway through the time, but it has already completed one-half. In the increase in production, production efficiency has been unprecedentedly improved. For example, on the night shift of the 12th of last month, 314 bags of "cow flour" were produced, equivalent to the output of one day and one night in the early days of liberation. In order to complete the plan ahead of schedule, during the New Year holiday, worker Ma Fengshan automatically prepared grinding rollers and dies to ensure smooth production next month. In the oil pressing plant of the factory, with the efforts of workers Wang Keqi and Yang Shengkui, 2,365 jin of oil were produced in a certain day and night last month, setting a new record since the factory began. The Motor Unit of the Xinhua Textile and Dyeing Factory planned to weave 780 bolts of cloth last month. By the 30th, they had woven 37 bolts more. The Wooden Loom Unit, which has 20 wooden looms, originally planned to weave 502 bolts of cloth, but now it has also woven 75 bolts more, allowing the entire factory to complete its task two days ahead of schedule, weaving a total of 132 bolts of foreign cloth. The Soy Sauce Mash Factory, which participated in the competition to increase production and make up for losses, not only completed 78,000 jin of soy sauce mash on the 28th of last month but also exceeded the plan by 1,964 jin. At the same time, the factory often had to hire some short-term workers when manufacturing raw materials. This time, not only were 54 short-term workers saved, but also two skilled workers were saved compared to before. The Yuhua Machinery Factory of the company, machinists Jia Ziqiang, Li Fengqi, Li Zhaoqian and other workers, in order to welcome the New Year, automatically turned the large shaft of the weaving machine, the small shaft of the shaper, and the slide block bearing bushes of the shaper during their rest on the 24th of last month; carpenter Wang Chengying asked for leave due to personal reasons, and returned to make up for work after dinner; foundry workers Miao Jiantang, Wang Zhansheng, Wang Lulu and other workers, in order to strive to complete the production task of the eight-foot gantry planer before the Gregorian New Year, processed and worked overtime day and night. In the Soap Department of the Chemical Factory, in the increase in production and making up for losses, due to the initial inadequate planning by the leadership, insufficient estimation of machine, climate, holiday and technical conditions, and failure to arouse the active enthusiasm of all workers to increase production and make up for losses, more than 500 boxes of soap became damp, and then the output was sharply reduced due to excessive drying. After inspection and correction, the daily output was increased, and an additional 495 jin of oil and 800 jin of caustic soda solution were produced. If the above deviations had not occurred, in addition to completing the task of increasing production and making up for losses now, it would have exceeded the average monthly output by 40%.

　　石市裕民各厂竞赛紧张
  　提前完成生产计划
    工人王克琪等创榨油新记录
    【石家庄讯】本市裕民实业公司在开展革命竞赛生产挑战的紧张情绪下，各厂纷纷完成增产补损的生产计划，该公司的两个面粉厂，由于全体职工的积极努力，二厂由年前十一月十五至十二月三十一日生产两万袋面粉的计划至上月二十九日，已提前两天完成，并多生产面粉百八十五袋。除此还帮助一厂回×面粉万斤。一厂两个月增产补损二万五千袋面粉的任务，现在时间不及一半，但已完成二分之一，在增产中，生产效率空前提高，如上月十二日夜班即出牛粉三百一十四袋，相等于解放初期一天一夜的产量，为了提前完成计划，新年放假中，工友马凤山自动准备磨滚子，拉丝，保证下月顺利生产。该厂榨油厂，在工友王克琪、杨生魁的努力之下，上月某一昼夜，即生产油二千三百六十五斤，创下该厂开始以来的新记录。新华染织工厂电机股上月计划织出七百八十匹布的任务，至三十日止，即多织了三十七匹，拥有廿台木机的木机股原计划要求织出五百零二匹布，而现在也多织了七十五匹，使全厂提前两天完成任务，总共多织一百卅二匹洋布，参加增产补损竞赛的酱醪厂，于上月二十八日，不但完成了七万八千斤酱醪，并超过计划一千九百六十四斤，同时该厂在制造原料时，经常要雇用若干短工，此次不仅节省了五十四个短工，并较以前还节省了两个熟练工人。该公司的裕华机器工厂机工贾自强、李凤岐、李兆谦等工友，为了迎接新年，在上月二十四日休息的时候，即自动旋织布机大轴，旋牛头刨的小轴，和牛头刨幌子轴瓦；木工王承盈因事请假，饭后回来又去补工；翻砂股苗建堂、王占盛、王炉炉等工友，为了争取在阳历年前完成八尺龙门刨车的生产任务，日夜加工加班。化学厂的肥皂部在增产补损中，由于领导上最初计划不周，对机器，气候，休假及技术等条件估计不足，又没发动起全体工友增产补损的积极热情，致使五百余箱肥皂发湿，后又因过度干燥使产量锐减，经检查纠正后，才提高了每日产量，并添产油四百九十五斤，火碱水八百斤，如不发生以上偏向，在现在完成增产补损的任务之外，还会超过以往每月平均产量的百分之四十。（石家庄日报）
