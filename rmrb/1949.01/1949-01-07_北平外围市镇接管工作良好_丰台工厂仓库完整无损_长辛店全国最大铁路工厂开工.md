Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Pingjin, 4th: The takeover and restoration work in Fengtai and Changxindian, important railway towns surrounding Beiping, has been successful. Thanks to the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army, all railways, factories, electricity, telephone, and warehouses in Fengtai Town are largely intact. Within ten days of the town's liberation, all employees in various industries, except for a small number of Kuomintang personnel and those who had entered Beiping City before the town's liberation and had not returned, had reported for work and resumed operations. The 91-kilometer section of the Beining Railway's Pingjin line from Fengtai to Yangcun was repaired and reopened to traffic on December 25th. As of December 24th, more than 470 Kuomintang and Three Youth League members in Fengtai Town had registered with the People's Government to turn over a new leaf. The work of searching for weapons hidden by the enemy in the town has also yielded results. In a well south of the railway bridge alone, 12 light machine guns and more than 60 rifles were retrieved.

Changxindian is the site of the largest railway factory on the Pinghan Railway. The People's Liberation Army entered the city at 1:00 AM on December 15th. At 3:00 AM, the military leader of a certain unit convened a meeting with the heads of various units of the railway factory, announcing that all employees should stick to their posts, protect machinery and materials, and quickly resume work. At 7:00 AM, the railway factory employees organized and began repairing the railway and the Lugou Bridge, seven li north of the city, which had been damaged by the bandit Fu. At 8:00 AM, the factory sounded its whistle and started work, with most of the more than 4,000 employees continuing to work. That night, the two sections of railway from the city to Fengtai and to Zhuoxian were reopened to traffic. Changxindian is located 40 li southwest of Beiping, with a population of about 30,000, mainly railway workers and their families. The Changxindian Railway Factory was founded in the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923). Before the War of Resistance, its scale was second only to the Tangshan Railway Factory. During the Japanese occupation, it was expanded, with new factories added. Some of its equipment has surpassed that of the Tangshan Railway Factory and ranks first among all railway factories in the country. Fengtai Town is located 12 li southwest of Beiping City, at the intersection of the Pinghan and Beining Railways and a major supply base for the Kuomintang army in the past. Of the town's population of more than 11,000, employees in various industries and their families account for more than half.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Front Lines, 4th: The Shijingshan industrial and mining area in the western suburbs of Beiping has been properly protected by a unit of the People's Liberation Army that arrived in the area, and the materials and equipment of the various mines and factories in the area have not been damaged in the slightest. Although the unit lacked cars, it did not arbitrarily use the twelve trucks and four jeeps in the iron and steel plant. The Pingjin Front Headquarters has issued a special order to commend them.

　　北平外围市镇接管工作良好
  　丰台工厂仓库完整无损
    长辛店全国最大铁路工厂开工
    【新华社平津前线四日电】北平外围重要铁路市镇——丰台与长辛店的接管与恢复工作，成绩良好。由于人民解放军进军神速，丰台镇所有铁路、工厂、电灯、电话、仓库等均大致完整无损。该镇解放后十日中，各业员工除少数国民党人员及该镇解放前进入北平城未归者外，均已报到复工复业。北宁路平津线丰台至杨村段九十一公里，已于十二月二十五日修复通车。丰台镇的国民党及三青团人员向人民政府登记自新者，迄十二月二十四日止已有四百七十余人。该镇搜缴敌人匿藏武器的工作，也得到了成绩。仅在铁路大桥以南的一个水井中，即取出轻机枪十二挺，步枪六十余支。
    长辛店为平汉铁路最大铁路工厂所在地。解放军于十二月十五日晨一时进入该市。三时，某部军事首长即召集铁路工厂各单位主管人开会，向他们宣布所有职工应坚守岗位，保护机器物资，迅速复工。早上七时，铁路工厂职工即组织起来，开始修理被傅匪破坏的铁路与该市北七里的芦沟桥。八时，该厂鸣笛开工，四千余职工大部继续工作。当日夜间，该市至丰台及至涿县的两段铁路即恢复通车。按长辛店位于北平西南四十里，人口约三万，其中主要为铁路工人及其家属。长辛店铁路工厂创始于民国十二年，其规模在抗战前仅次于唐山铁路工厂，日寇占领时，曾加扩充，增设新厂，其中某些设备已超过唐山铁路工厂，且在全国各铁路工厂中占第一位。丰台镇位于北平城西南十二里，为平汉与北宁两大铁路交叉点及过去国民党军重要补给基地。全镇一万一千余人口中，各业职工及其家属占一半以上。
    【新华社北平前线四日电】北平西郊石景山工矿区经进抵该区之解放军某部妥加保护，该区各矿厂的物资设备未受丝毫损坏。该部虽缺乏汽车，对炼铁厂内之十二辆卡车和四辆吉普车也未擅自动用。平津前线司令部特通令予以嘉奖。
