　　The Experience and Lessons of the People's Bank of Jincheng County Branch's Two Months of Lending in Kind
    Fu Ting
    The People's Bank of Jincheng County Branch conducted a period of lending in kind starting in October of last year. Because of insufficient understanding of lending in kind at the time, there were biases in the work. After a recent inspection, some experiences and lessons were drawn. These are presented for reference by various regions.
    I. Preserving Capital and Supporting Production Should Not Be Opposed
    Since the branch manager meeting in September of last year, due to insufficient research on the policy of preserving capital in kind, many cadres transformed their previous ideas of charitable relief into a pure ideology of preserving capital. Therefore, in various production loans, the emphasis was entirely on lending in kind, and in lending in kind, special emphasis was placed on lending grain. Although some loans were made, they mostly started from the idea of preserving capital, believing that with stable prices, lending with higher interest rates was more cost-effective than lending in kind, without considering supporting mass production. Preserving capital was opposed to supporting mass production; some even regarded preserving capital as the main task of the bank. Therefore, the role of bank loans in supporting mass production was reduced. Recent inspections have revealed that many borrowers lost money because lending grain did not suit their production needs. For example, Ren Xiaoshan and two others from Tainan Village in the seventh district requested loans for running transport and sales. The bank emphasized lending in kind, and the three people borrowed a total of six shi of rice. After running for a month, they earned 1,100 yuan (new currency), excluding expenses. When repaying the loan, they completely used up their earnings and even lost an additional one shi and five dou of millet. Another example is iron industry loans. When the sales of iron goods were slow in October, iron smelters requested the bank to lend iron or place orders, but the bank was afraid that the sales of iron goods would be slow, and lending money or grain was more secure. Therefore, they emphasized not placing orders and only lending money or grain. As a result, many iron smelters lost money because the price of grain rose faster than iron goods. In early December, when the sales of iron goods were fast, a small number of smelters requested to borrow less money for short-term support, but when the bank saw that iron goods were profitable, it emphasized placing orders instead of lending money. This made the loans completely contrary to the production needs of the masses, causing losses to production. Even in some places, the bank also lost money.
    In addition, some lending in kind was beneficial to both the borrowers and the bank, even profitable. Although this was not consciously done at the time, the actual role it played provides a good inspiration for future lending in kind: For example, the lending in kind to oil mills was lending soybeans and repaying with bean cakes. When prices rose, the price of soybeans doubled, the price of oil also doubled, and the price of bean cakes also doubled. The lending to textile was lending cotton and repaying with cotton. After the textile women borrowed, the price of cotton rose by 35 percent, the price of thread rose by 35 percent, and the price of cloth rose by 70 percent. In this way, oil mills and textile women preserved their capital and even made a profit in the face of price fluctuations, and the bank also preserved its capital.
    II. Different Kinds of In-Kind Lending Should be Granted to Different Production Objects
    According to the above inspection, it can be seen that it is not that the policy of preserving capital is in conflict with supporting mass production, but that the bank does not have enough understanding of the specific nature of each production and the impact of the season on production. Therefore, future lending in kind must be based on the specific circumstances of each production, granting different kinds of in kind to different production objects and different seasons, and stipulating different terms. We oppose the practice of lending grain or converting to grain regardless of what kind of production the borrower is engaged in. For the calculation method of preserving capital, it must be that the bank lends what kind of in kind, and that kind of in kind is preserved, and there should be no other standards. This will ensure that the lending in kind is truly used for production. In the event of price fluctuations, neither party will have a significant risk of losing money. The above-mentioned lending in kind to workshops and textiles is a good example. At the same time, we should also oppose the tailism practice of blindly satisfying all the requirements of the masses, lending whatever the masses want. It must be carried out according to different situations under the entire production plan of the government. For example, (1) lending in kind to oil mills should be lending soybeans and repaying with bean cakes, because winter is the production season for oil mills, and the term is best to lend in winter and repay in spring, giving it a certain turnover process so that the oil mills can make a profit. After receiving the cakes in the spring, they can be lent to the masses for fertilizer. This will not only support the oil mills but also provide the masses with the convenience of borrowing and purchasing fertilizer. (2) Transportation loans, in addition to a small portion used to purchase vehicles and tools, most are used as transportation and sales capital, which is similar in nature to small urban vendors. The turnover is rapid and flexible, and the required term is short. The goods they operate are mostly not fixed. If grain is lent, the borrowers have to take the grain to the market to sell. At the same time, the rise and fall of grain prices and the prices of their operated goods are not balanced, which is unfavorable to transporters and may even cause them to lose money. Therefore, transportation loans, except for some large fixed ones, such as lending cotton for transporting cotton and lending salt for transporting salt, generally use the method of lending money and repaying with interest. This not only meets the actual needs of the masses but also promotes the development of the transportation industry. In the absence of special price fluctuations, the bank can preserve its capital, and the masses can also make a profit. (3) Textile is best to lend cotton and repay with cotton or cloth. The term should generally be lend in winter and spring and repay in autumn, so that the borrowers can obtain a longer turnover time, can produce more and earn more. On the other hand, it is easy to repay cotton in the new cotton season. (4) In the industrial field, such as the iron industry, when the sales of finished products are slow, more investment and ordering methods should be adopted to solve the difficulties of mass sales. When the masses have insufficient start-up capital, they can be given loans or iron to provide support. (5) In terms of agricultural loans, if the masses borrow money to buy livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, etc., they should generally try to collect and release them according to the agricultural season. For example, spring and winter release and summer harvest, summer release and autumn harvest; but we must also pay attention to mastering rural sideline production and try to combine agricultural and sideline production. That is to say, agricultural loans can be repaid with the profits earned from sideline industries, and sideline industry loans can also be repaid with agricultural production. Only in this way can we truly meet the production requirements of the masses, and the policy of lending in kind can be easily accepted by the masses. In short, capital turnover must be subordinate to production.

　　人民银行晋城县支行两月贷实的经验教训
    辅庭
    人民银行晋城支行从去年十月份起，进行了一段实物贷款工作，因为当时对贷实认识不足，工作中发生了偏向。经最近检查，得出一些经验教训。兹提出，供各地参考。
    一、保本和扶植生产不应对立
    自去年九月份分支行经理会议后，因为对实物保本政策研究不够，有许多干部把已往的恩赐救济观点一变而为单纯的保本思想。因此在各种生产贷款中完全强调了贷实，在贷实中又特别强调了贷粮食。虽然有些是贷了款，但也多从保本思想出发，认为物价平稳，贷款提高利息比贷实合算，没有从扶植群众生产去考虑。把保本与扶植群众生产对立起来；有的更把保本认为是银行工作的主要任务。因此，降低了银行贷款扶植群众生产的作用。在最近检查中，发现有许多贷户，因为贷粮食不合其生产性质而赔了本。如七区铁南村任小山等三人要求贷款跑运销，银行强调贷实，三人共贷米六石；跑了一个月，除化费共赚洋一千一百元（新币），还款时，把赚的钱完全贴上，又赔出小米一石五斗。又如铁业贷款，当十月份铁货销路不快时，铁炉要求银行贷铁或订货，但当时银行怕铁货销路不快，不如贷款或贷粮食保险，因此强调不订货，只贷给款或粮食。结果因铁货没粮食涨的快，有许多贷粮食的铁炉赔了本。十二月初铁货销路快了，少部分炉户要求少贷些款给予短期支垫，但银行看到铁货有利，则又强调订货而不贷款。这样使贷款完全与群众的生产要求相违背。使生产受到损失。甚至在某些地方银行也赔了本。
    另外也有部分贷实，贷户、银行双方都保了本，甚至有利。这在当时虽不是有意识地发放，但实际所起的作用，则给予今后贷实工作一个很好的启示：如当时对油坊贷实是贷豆还豆饼，在物价上涨时，豆涨一倍，油亦涨了一倍，而豆饼也涨了一倍。纺织是贷花还花。纺妇贷款后，花涨百分之三十五，线涨百分之三十五，布则涨百分之七十。这样油坊、纺妇虽在物价波动中，也保了本，而且有利，银行也保了本。
    二、不同生产对象贷给不同实物
    根据上述检查，可以看出不是保本政策与扶植群众生产有矛盾，而是银行对每一生产的具体性质及季节对生产的影响认识不够。因此今后的实物贷款，必须根据每一生产的具体情况，按不同的生产对象及不同的季节，贷给不同的实物，规定不同的期限。反对不管贷户经营何种生产，都是贷给粮食或都以粮食折算的办法。对于保本计算方法，必须是银行贷什么实物保什么本而不应有其他标准。这样就能保证贷实真正用于生产。在物价波动时，双方亦不会有很大的赔本危险。上述作坊纺织的贷实，就是很好的例证。同时也应反对那种群众要什么就贷什么，盲目地满足群众一切要求的尾巴主义作法。必须在政府的整个生产计划之下，按不同的情况去进行。如（一）油坊贷实，应该是贷豆还豆饼，因冬季是油坊生产季节，期限最好是冬贷春还给其一定的周转过程，使油坊有利可图。春天收饼后，又可以贷给群众做肥料。这样既扶植了油坊，也给群众以贷购肥料的方便。（二）运输贷款除小部分用于购买车辆工具外，大部分则是做运销资本，其性质同于城市小商贩，周转迅速灵活，要求期限短，其经营之商品又多不能固定，如贷给粮食，贷户还得把粮食拿到市场去卖，同时粮价及其经营之物品价格涨落不平衡，对运销者不利甚至可能赔本。因此，运输贷款，除一些大的固定性的，如运花贷花运盐贷盐外，一般的应用贷款还款提高利息的办法。这样既合乎群众的实际要求，更可促进运输事业的发展。在物价不发生特殊波动的情况下，银行可以保本，群众也有利可图。（三）纺织以贷花还花或还布的办法为宜，期限一般应是冬、春贷秋还，这样一方面贷户获得较长时间的周转，可以多生产多赚钱；另方面到新花季节还花容易。（四）工业方面，如铁业在成品销路不快时，应多采取投资订货的办法，以解决群众销路困难。在群众开办资金不足时，可以贷款或贷铁，给予扶植。（五）在农业贷款方面，如群众贷款买牲口、农具、肥料等，一般应尽量根据农业季节收放。如春、冬放夏收，夏放秋收；但也要注意掌握农村副业生产尽量使农、副业生产结合起来。也就是说，农业贷款可以使副业赚利还，而副业贷款也可以由农业生产还，只有这样才能真正合乎群众的生产要求，贷实政策也才易为群众接受。总而言之，必须使资金周转服从于生产。
