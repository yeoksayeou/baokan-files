　　Outstanding Warriors for Freedom
  　Two Members of the Greek Communist Party Central Committee Gloriously Sacrificed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] The Free Greece Radio broadcast: Greek Communist Party Central Committee members Tistelos and Vasiliadis, after many years of heroic struggle against fascism, successively and gloriously sacrificed on the front lines and at the execution ground. Greek Communist Party Central Committee member and Commander of the Crete Democratic Army, George Tistelos, sacrificed in battle against the royalist fascist army on Crete. Tistelos served as the secretary of the Greek Communist Party's Crete Committee for many years. He was first arrested and imprisoned during the Metaxas dictatorship, and later arrested by the German and Italian occupiers. After escaping from prison in 1943, he led the struggle of the Greek National Liberation Front in the Morea Peninsula. After 1945, due to persecution by the royalist fascists, he returned to Crete and organized and led the battles of the Democratic Army. Greek Communist Party Central Committee member Aristos Vasiliadis spent many years in fascist prisons. He was one of the most outstanding fighters for Greek freedom. Last December, he was sentenced to death by the royalist fascist military court in Thessaloniki and executed in December.
