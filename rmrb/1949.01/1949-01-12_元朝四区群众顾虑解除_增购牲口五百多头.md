　　Worries of the Masses in the Fourth District of Yuanchao Eliminated
  　More Than 500 Head of Livestock Purchased
    [Jinan News] The Fourth District of Yuanchao has seized upon the production demands of the masses, eliminated production obstacles in various villages, and organized mass production, achieving remarkable results in forty days of work. Within forty days, the entire district increased its livestock purchases by 549 head, and the number of feeding households increased to 879. Farmers repaired 14 large carts, 36 small carts, 10 plows, 2 harrows, 3 seed drills, 71 hoes, and 83 mattocks, creating favorable conditions for spring plowing. The masses in Qian Baozhuang Village said, "With carts, plows, and oxen, we won't have to worry about spring plowing this year." In forty days, 521 pigs were added, along with 84 pigpens and 41 manure pits, producing 20,736 large cartloads of winter fertilizer, more than half as much as last year. Sideline occupations are also doing particularly well: sideline occupations that were inactive in the past are now active. In forty days, 2 oil mills, 1 flour mill, 3 steamed bun shops, 5 cotton gins, and 6 cotton bows were added, along with 110 other small handicrafts and small trading businesses. Households engaged in sideline occupations account for 40% of the total number of households in the district, and the labor force involved accounts for more than 54% of the total, earning 46,400,087 yuan (Jinan currency, same below). More than 2,700 young and middle-aged women are engaged in spinning, weaving, and other sideline activities.
    The district's method of organizing mass production is: to conduct in-depth investigations to understand the masses' various misunderstandings and ideological concerns about policies, and to provide specific and vivid policy explanations for different problems. Furthermore, they learned about the possession of production materials and production conditions of various classes and households, the production habits of the masses, and production difficulties, and resolved them in a timely manner. For example, when the work team discovered that various sideline occupations could not be developed due to a lack of capital, they requested bank loans to support them. When they discovered that there was a shortage of livestock in Mutidi Village, they had timely individual talks to dispel the masses' concerns about going to war, and the village immediately bought 54 head of livestock. Some people opposed being organized, saying, "Mutual aid is just a waste of time and doesn't do any good." The work team examined the previous mandatory orders and formalism in leadership, so that everyone understood that the purpose of organization was to increase production. Baozhuang thus organized six flour mills and 125 households. The masses of Qian Baozhuang Village raised the issue that the use of farm tools was unfair and there were no rules. After discussions in various groups, it was decided to establish a farm tool management committee and set ten rules, which added two large carts, and the plows and harrows were also repaired. Chenxian Village discovered that the unreasonable allocation of official duties had led to a reduction in livestock. After mass discussions, a method for allocating labor burdens was established, and the issue of official duties was reasonably resolved, followed by the purchase of 19 head of livestock. The masses of Zhong Fantidi Village were worried that they would not have enough food. When the work team arrived in the village, they said, "Are we still going to divide it equally? We'll have to go hungry during the New Year." Based on the feedback from the masses, the work team proposed "specific accounting and family-based planning," calling on the masses to save and produce, and immediately some people started pulling boats, some started small businesses, and women spun and weaved at home. The masses said, "The work team is really thoughtful for us, this approach is different from the past." In this way, the majority of the masses participated in winter sideline activities. In Qian Baozhuang Village, 175 out of 225 households participated. Among the 50 households that did not participate, 20 had no labor force. (Tian Fang, Xian Lin)

　　元朝四区群众顾虑解除
  　增购牲口五百多头
    【冀南讯】元朝四区抓住群众的生产要求，从各方面扫除各村生产障碍，组织群众生产，在四十天的工作中，获得显著成绩。全区四十天内增买牲口五百四十九头，喂户增到八百七十九户。农民修理好大车十四辆，小车三十六辆，犁十张，耙二张，耧三张，锄七十一把，撅头八十三把，给春耕创造了有利的条件。前鲍庄村的群众说：“有车有犁又有牛，今年春耕不发愁”。四十天中，添猪五百二十一口，添猪圈八十四个，粪坑四十一个，沤出冬肥二万零七百三十六大车。比去年沤的多一半，副业也搞的特别好：过去不活动的副业，现在都动起来了。四十天中添油房二座，粉房一座，馍馍房三座，轧花车五辆，弹花弓六个，其他小手工业和做零买卖的添一百一十一样。全区搞副业户数占总户数百分之四十，参加劳力占总数的百分之五十四强，获利四千六百四十万零八十七元（冀钞，下同）。参加纺织及其他副业活动的青壮年妇女达二千七百多人。
    该区组织群众生产的方法是：深入的调查了解群众对政策的各种误解和思想顾虑。针对不同的问题，进行具体的生动的政策解释。又进一步了解各阶层各户生产资料的占有和生产条件、群众的生产习惯、生产困难，及时解决。如工作组发现各种副业搞不起来的原因是没有资本，便请银行贷款支持。在木堤村发现牲口不够用时，及时个别谈话，解除群众怕出战勤的顾虑，该村即买牲口五十四个。有的群众反对组织起来，说：“互助光误工夫，没一点好处”，工作组即将以往领导上的强迫命令与形式主义作了检查，使大家明白组织的目的是增产。鲍庄就这样组织了六个粉坊，一百二十五户。前鲍庄群众提出农具的使用不公平，没有规矩，经过各小组争论，决定成立了农具保管委员会，定了十条规矩，即添大车两辆，犁耙也都修理起来。陈仙村发现出差不合理，造成了牲口的减少，经过群众讨论，定了劳力负担办法，合理解决了出差问题，随添买牲口十九头。中范堤群众发愁粮食不够吃，工作组到村时，就说：“还作平分呢，过年俺得挨饿啦”。根据群众反映，工作组提出“具体算帐，作按家计划”，号召群众节约生产，随即有一部分人开始拉船，一部人做起小买卖来，妇女在家纺织。群众说：“工作组给咱想的真周到，这一次的作法和过去不同啦。”这样，大多数群众参加了冬季副业活动。前鲍庄村二百二十五户中，即有一百七十五户参加。未参加的五十户中有二十户是没有劳动力的。（天放、羡麟）
