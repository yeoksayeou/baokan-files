　　Arranged Marriage Dissolved, No Need to Restore It
　　Editor:
　　We have a soldier in our unit who was engaged several years before joining the army, but it was an arranged marriage by his parents. After the engagement, both parties had no objections. However, after he joined the army, the woman proposed to dissolve the engagement. His parents, because it was an arrangement they made and they didn't understand the marriage policy well, agreed to the woman's request without consulting him. He only found out about this a long time later. He has not mentioned this matter to the woman or his parents (his family still doesn't know he knows about this). Is this considered a complete dissolution of the engagement? Please advise.
　　Yan Zhao, Fifth Detachment, 204th Brigade
　　Comrade Yan Zhao:
　　The parents arranged the engagement of their son and then arranged to dissolve the engagement; neither consulting him about the engagement nor notifying him about the dissolution. This matter cannot be blamed on the woman and should be entirely the responsibility of his parents. This engagement is considered dissolved, and there is no need to seek its restoration.

### 包办婚姻既已解约不必再去恢复

专栏：询问与答复

　　包办婚姻既已解约不必再去恢复编辑同志：
    我部有一战士，在他未参加部队的前几年，就订了婚，但是家长包办的婚姻。订婚以后，双方都没有意见。但是以后他参了军，女方提出解除婚约，他的家长因为是自己包办的，对婚姻政策也不大了解，就没和他商量便答应了女方的要求。直到很久以后他才知道这事，他既没有和女方，也没有和家长提说过这事情（家中还不知他知道这事情），这样是否就算完全解除了婚约，请答复为盼。
    二○四旅第五支队晏昭晏昭同志：
    父母包办订婚的未婚妻，又包办解除了婚约；订婚既不商量，解除婚约又不通知他，这件事情不能怪女方，应该完全由他父母负责。这个婚约算是解除了，不必再去求恢复。
