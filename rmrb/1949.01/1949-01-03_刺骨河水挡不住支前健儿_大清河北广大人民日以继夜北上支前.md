[Pingjin Front, 28th Dispatch] The people north of the Daqing River, who have long suffered from the ravages of the Fu-Wang bandits, have been fully mobilized to actively participate in and undertake various wartime service duties to support the campaign to liberate Pingjin. They are repairing roads and bridges, erecting power lines, and transporting grain day and night. From the 6th to the 15th, 800 bridge workers built 30 bridges along the Daqing River. While driving piles, the bridge workers cheerfully and powerfully sang, "Heave-ho! We're going to fight to Pingjin! Capture Fu Zuoyi alive!..." They said, "The sooner we build the bridge, the sooner Pingjin will be liberated." They are now rushing to repair the five bridges over the Yongding River. On the morning of the 16th, Baijiawu, north of the Yongding River, which had just been liberated, received an order to build a bridge. The whole village immediately gathered to plan the materials. Everyone scrambled to donate their wood, bricks, and firewood. Construction started that night and was completed before dawn. The district stipulated that it should be able to accommodate two large vehicles side by side, with a load capacity of 20,000 catties. After completion, it could accommodate three large vehicles side by side, with a load capacity of 100,000 catties. Baxian, Rongcheng, Xiongxian, and other counties have successively organized 16 large cart teams, with 2,160 large carts, to transport public grain to the Pingjin front. Since the 19th, over 2,313,000 catties of millet have been transferred from Rongcheng, Xiongxian, Baxian, Lixian, Dacheng, Wenxin, Hejian, and other counties, and large quantities of corn and white flour are still being transported continuously. Various counties are actively carrying out requisitioning. They all hold a hope: "Only after Pingjin is taken can we live a stable life." On the 18th, the Baxian cart team traveled 80 miles to Gu'an, and before they could rest, they happily accepted the task of transporting grain to Panggezhuang. When crossing the Yongding River, five large carts were trapped in the rapids. Song Huaizhi, a 19-year-old peasant, took off his clothes and jumped into the river, regardless of the cold, and rescued his companion who had fallen into the river. The next day, he went into the water again to carry three bags of millet to the river bank. The Rongcheng cart team, while performing their tasks, carried out policy education and put forward three major appeals at the national conference: (1) Do not go home until the task is completed; (2) Guarantee not to violate mass discipline; (3) Do not violate policies. An old cart worker, 65, from Nanwen Village, guarded the public grain in the cold of the night without leaving his cart, but did not burn a single piece of firewood from the masses. Yang Xiaofei, a militiaman following the cart in Matai, said: "We are not fleeing this time. In the past, the enemy drove us to run. This time, it's our turn to eliminate the enemy." They are organizing propaganda teams to carry out cultural and recreational activities wherever they go and write slogans. The Xiongxian cart team, wherever they are stationed, fetch water and sweep the courtyard for the landlord, and sweep the streets clean. Every night, two people from each row take turns feeding the livestock and guarding with guns. During the day, they help each other chop grass and cook. When transporting grain, weak carts carry less, and strong carts carry more, overcoming all difficulties to complete the task. Li Furong from Zhaogang has a cold leg, but this time he volunteered to join the expedition to deliver public grain. He said, "I slept in the open for three nights, and I'm not afraid of the cold. I just want to liberate Pingjin quickly so that we can live a stable life." Fourteen stretcher teams have successively advanced to the front line. On the 19th, the political commissar of the Baxian militia group and the Xiongxian stretcher team called on Communist Party members to strive to be models in crossing the river. The militiamen crossed the rapids in 15 minutes and excitedly rushed to the front line. The workers and masses who erected the power lines erected over a hundred miles of unobstructed power lines in three days and nights, ensuring communication before and after. With the efforts of more than 3,000 people, the hundred-mile-long road from Xinzhen to Gu'an was repaired in four or five days. The people north of the Yongding River, having just gotten rid of the enemy's long-term dark rule, are even more enthusiastic about supporting the front. Every village actively transports public grain. Changgezhuang, with a hundred or so households, received a notice to deliver 3,000 catties of flour, and they rushed to grind it overnight, and sent it the next day as required. The newly organized stretcher bearers said, "We don't need the public to prepare stretchers. We will make our own, and it will be even more effective." In order to cover the stretcher transport, 24 young adults from the people of Bei Wangli bravely signed up to join the militia. Old man Qi Dianrong said, "My eldest son manages the supplies, sign up my second son." In just over ten villages in the second, fourth, and fifth districts, 48 young adults shouldered their guns and came to the county to participate in supporting the front. Twenty-seven villages in the seventh district have established war service committees. Each village has actively organized four types of task forces. The mighty force of people, vehicles, stretchers, and militiamen supporting the liberation of Pingjin, crossing the Daqing River and the Yongding River, is flowing north day and night.
