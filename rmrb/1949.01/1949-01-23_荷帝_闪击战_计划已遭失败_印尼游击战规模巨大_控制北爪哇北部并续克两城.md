Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. The Dutch imperialists, with the connivance of the United States and Britain, have seen their plan to eliminate the Indonesian people's resistance through a "blitzkrieg" fail. Contrary to the boast of Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker on the 9th that "the entire Indonesian archipelago will soon return to order" (referring to reactionary rule), the Indonesian people's anti-Dutch guerrilla war has developed to a massive scale. The "Mediation" Committee, controlled by the United States, admitted in a report to the Security Council on the 14th that the operations of the Indonesian guerrillas were "on a scale far exceeding what the Dutch had anticipated," and stated that "the scorched earth policy seriously threatens the Dutch police action," and "Dutch forces are insufficient to maintain law and order or to stop the guerrilla actions of the Indonesian army." Reports from various sources indicate that a large area between Semarang and Pekalongan (85 kilometers west of Semarang) in northern Central Java is already under guerrilla control, and the area around Semarang is "full of guerrillas." Following their attack on the Indonesian capital Yogyakarta on the 9th, the Central Java guerrillas captured Walikukun City between Madiun City and Sragen City after fierce fighting on the 13th, killing 85 Dutch soldiers. On the same day, Pathukretek City near Wonogiri in Central Java was also occupied by guerrillas, and the entire Dutch garrison was wiped out. Neutral observers residing in Surabaya stated that within the vast area south of Surabaya, guerrillas destroyed 100 bridges, and traffic in the area has completely stopped. Under the "scorched earth tactics," nine oil fields between Palembang and Jambi in southern Sumatra have been destroyed, and more than ten large plantations of the Dutch occupiers (including large palm plantations producing hundreds of tons of palm oil per month) have been burned. Dutch landlords, fearing the power of the guerrillas, have taken refuge in the cities and dare not return to their hometowns.

On the other hand, American and British imperialism continue to openly defend Dutch aggression. During the Security Council's discussions on the Indonesian issue on the 7th, 11th, and 14th of this month, the Dutch representative continued to refuse to withdraw its troops, a reactionary stance that received blatant support from British representative Jebb. On the 14th, Jebb defended the Netherlands, saying that the withdrawal of Dutch troops would create a "dangerous vacuum." American and British representatives have recently continued to adopt delaying tactics in the Security Council's discussions on the Dutch aggression against Indonesia. TASS commented that "its purpose is to give the Dutch government more time to create the impression that the Indonesian resistance has been defeated, that the Security Council has nothing to do, and can only recognize the 'fait accompli,' so as to 'rationalize' the Dutch abolition of the Republic of Indonesia, after which the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands can decide the fate of Indonesia without hindrance." At the Security Council meeting on the 11th, Soviet representative Malik continued to severely criticize the United States and Britain for acting as "protectors of Dutch aggression," and accused the United Nations "Mediation" Committee of continuing to cover up the Dutch policy of aggression in Indonesia. Malik rebuked the US representative's slanderous activities against the Soviet Union in the Security Council, saying: "The slander against the Soviet Union and the so-called communist threat to Southeast Asia cannot reduce the United States' responsibility for aggression against Indonesia."

　　荷帝“闪击战”计划已遭失败
  　印尼游击战规模巨大
    控制北爪哇北部并续克两城
    【新华社陕北二十日电】在美、英纵容下的荷兰帝国主义以“闪击战”消灭印尼人民抵抗的计划，证明已遭失败。与荷外长斯蒂克九日所称“整个印尼群岛不久将恢复秩序”（按指反动统治）的狂言相反，印尼人民的反荷游击战争，已发展至巨大的规模。美国控制下的“调处”委员会，十四日在给安理会的报告中，承认印尼游击队的作战，“规模之大，远超过荷兰所预料的”。并谓“焦士政策严重地威胁了荷兰的警察行动”，“荷军力量不足维持法律与秩序或阻止印尼军的游击行动。”各方报导指出：中爪哇北部三宝珑与北加浪岸（三宝珑以西八十五公里）之间的大片地区，已在游击队控制之下，三宝珑市周围“满是游击队”。中爪哇游击队继九日袭入印尼首府日惹之后，复于十三日经激战后占领茉莉芬市与斯拉根城之间的瓦利库龙城，毙荷军八十五名。同日，中爪哇乌诺基利附近的巴土利卓城，亦被游击队占领，荷兰守备队全部被歼。旅居泗水的中立观察家称：泗水以南的广大地区之内，游击队破坏桥梁百座，该地区的交通已完全停顿。在“焦土战术”之下，苏门答腊南部巨港与占碑间的油田，已有九处被毁，荷占领者的大庄园（包括每月产棕榈油数百吨的大棕榈园）十余处被焚。害怕游击队威力的荷兰大地主，均避居城市不敢返乡。
    另一方面，美英帝国主义继续公开卫护荷兰的侵略。在本月七日、十一日与十四日安理会讨论印尼问题的过程中，荷代表继续拒绝撤军的反动立场，受到英代表贾德干的露骨支持。贾德干于十四日为荷兰辩护称：荷军的撤退，将造成“危险的真空”。美英代表近来在安理会讨论荷兰侵略印尼的问题上，继续采取拖延政策，塔斯社评称：“其目的是在给荷兰政府以更多的时间来制造一种印象，即：印尼的抵抗已被击溃，安理会已无事可做，只有承认‘既成事实’，从而使荷兰废除印尼共和国一事‘合理化’，此后，美英荷便能毫无阻碍地决定印尼的命运。”在十一日的安理会上，苏代表马立克对美英充当“荷兰侵略保护者”的身份，继续予以严厉抨击，并指责联合国“调处”委员会目前在印尼的活动，继续为荷兰的侵略政策作掩护。马立克斥责美代表在安理会上对苏联的诽谤活动称：“对苏联的诽谤及所谓共产党对东南亚的威胁，都不能减轻美国对于侵略印尼的责任。”
