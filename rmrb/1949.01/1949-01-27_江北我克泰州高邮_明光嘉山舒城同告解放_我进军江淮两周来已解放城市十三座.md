Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th: The People's Liberation Army recaptured the important city of Taizhou on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province on the 21st. The defending enemy fled south. The People's Liberation Army also recaptured the important towns of Hai'an to the east of the city and Qinrong to the northeast on the 17th and 20th. Also: The Gaoyou Kuomintang bandit troops fled south on the 18th, and the city was recovered by the People's Liberation Army. Note: The previous report of the recapture of Gaoyou on the 16th of last month was inaccurate.

Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 25th: The People's Liberation Army liberated the important stations of Mingguang and Guandian, as well as Jiashan County, on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the 21st; the defending enemy fled south. On the same day, another unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Xinji to the northeast of Linhuai Pass and Xujiashan and Caojiashan to the east, annihilating a company of the 99th Division of the 99th Army of the Kuomintang army's Li Yannian Corps. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Shucheng County at 9 p.m. on the 22nd, capturing more than 50 enemy soldiers. Since the People's Liberation Army advanced into the Jianghuai area on the 12th of this month, it has liberated thirteen cities, namely: Huaiyuan, Fengtai, Fengyang, Wuhe, Gaoyou, Bengbu, Hefei, Taizhou, Jiashan, Lai'an, Shucheng, Chuxian, and Hanshan. The Kuomintang bandit troops fleeing south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway destroyed the famous Huaihe River iron bridge north of Bengbu, as well as fourteen railway bridges and eleven stations between Bengbu and Chuxian. This destructive act by the Kuomintang bandit troops shows that the war criminals of the Nanjing puppet government are still attempting a desperate military struggle, and also proves the hypocrisy and deceptiveness of their "peace seeking." The People's Liberation Army will investigate the culprits who instigated this destructive crime and severely punish them in accordance with the order for the punishment of war criminals.

　　江北我克泰州高邮
  　明光嘉山舒城同告解放
    我进军江淮两周来已解放城市十三座
    【新华社华中二十五日电】人民解放军于二十一日收复江苏省长江北岸重要城市泰州，守敌向南逃窜。解放军并于十七、二十两日收复该城以东之海安及东北之溱潼两重镇。又：高邮国民党匪军于十八日向南逃窜，该城当为解放军收复。按：前报上月十六日收复高邮不确。
    【新华社蚌埠二十五日电】解放军于二十一日解放津浦南段重要车站明光、管店及嘉山县城，守敌南逃。同日，另部解放军攻克临淮关东北之新集及以东之徐家山、曹家山，歼灭国民党军李延年兵团九十九军九十九师的一个连。又另部解放军于二十二日晚九时攻克舒城县城，俘敌五十余人。自本月十二日人民解放军向江淮地区进军以来，已解放十三座城市，计为：怀远、凤台、凤阳、五河、高邮、蚌埠、合肥、泰州、嘉山、来安、舒城、滁县、含山。沿津浦路向南逃窜的国民党匪军，曾将蚌埠北之著名淮河大铁桥炸毁，并将蚌埠至滁县间铁路桥梁十四座及车站十一处完全毁坏。国民党匪军此破坏行为，表明南京伪政府的战争罪犯们尚图作绝望性的军事挣扎，也证明其“求和”的虚伪性和欺骗性。人民解放军将查究主使此一破坏罪行的凶犯，依照惩办战争罪犯命令予以严办。
