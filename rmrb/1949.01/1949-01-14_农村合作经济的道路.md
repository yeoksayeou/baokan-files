　　The Path of Rural Cooperative Economy
    Ding Kun
  　A Stark Contrast
    Millions of peasants and small producers desperately need cooperatives. Without cooperatives, they will have no way to escape poverty. A farmer from Dongjiao Village (under the jurisdiction of Huolu County) told me that he dug up Huangqin (a medicinal material) for two days and went to the market to sell it, but the profits were less than selling firewood. Although the village had undergone land reform, it had suffered poor harvests for two consecutive years. Another newly emancipated farmer frankly told me: "The new era is not as good as the old era. In the past, when there was a bad harvest, we could sell land and borrow money to survive. Now, although land distribution and emancipation are good, we have few options when we encounter this situation." The logic is very clear. The two farmers' conversations meant the same thing: they were asking to organize them to open up sources of income. Dongjiao Village, a village of about a thousand households, faces the inevitable threat of starvation for many farmers next spring, but because there is no cooperative organization, a large number of laborers are idle on the streets. Isn't the problem very clear? Without the organizational power of cooperatives, individual farmers cannot fight against poverty. However, the situation in Dongjiao Village only illustrates one side of the problem. In most areas of our entire North China Liberated Area, cooperatives have been organized. According to statistics from Taihang and Beiyue alone in 1946, cooperatives had reached more than 57 percent of administrative villages. Many farmers have personally experienced the benefits of cooperatives. The farmers in Longwang Village, Heshun, wanted to exchange the hemp they produced for necessities, but selling it in the local area was half the price of selling it in the city, and merchants would earn a profit of one times. If the cooperative concentrated the farmers' hemp, carried it to the city, and exchanged it for necessities, deducting only the freight, the sold goods would fetch a higher price, and the purchased goods would be cheaper. With this difference, the farmers would benefit. The Xia Sanli Village Cooperative in Wu'an organized women to spin cotton, and bought seventeen waterwheels, greatly facilitating and improving farmers' production. ... Thanks to the cooperatives, many counties in Taihang organized all possible labor to spin cotton, transport goods, and cut firewood, enabling them to overcome the severe famine of 1943. This shows that farmers desperately need cooperatives. They need cooperatives to supply their means of production and living, and they also need cooperatives to sell their finished products. When the Party had not yet seized power and the rural economy was still controlled by the landlord class and old commercial capital, farmers relied on merchants and the market for exchange; therefore, they could not avoid the intermediate exploitation by merchants. Today, they are asking to rely on the cooperatives led by their own people's government to solve this problem. However, this problem has not been well resolved in recent years, and the people do not fully support the cooperatives. The cooperatives themselves are also often in a precarious situation. In the year before last, the general rate of cooperative collapse reached 70 to 80 percent. After a year of rectification last year, according to statistics from the Taihang Administrative Office, only one-fifth have been rectified. Many of the rectified cooperatives can barely stay open. The Huiyuantou Village Cooperative in Pingshun had already incurred a new debt of 500,000 yuan just five days after rectification. The Yangjiazhuang Cooperative in Shexian prepared to do business in Henan Town (town) after rectification. Of the 24 cooperatives in the first district of Changzhi, 16 were still considered to have incorrect business directions after rectification. Why have the cooperatives been doing poorly for several years? This requires examining the reasons from history and learning from them.
    Historical Recollections
    As early as the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, in the initial stage of our Party establishing base areas, with the establishment of anti-Japanese democratic governments, vast rural areas in the former Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu regions had established cooperatives. Although the Party had already gained leadership over the government at that time, the implementation of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction policy was only beginning, and the majority of peasants had not yet risen up to seek liberation from feudal oppression. At that time, it was wrong to propose the slogan of "every village has a cooperative, everyone joins the cooperative" in the work of organizing cooperatives. The result obtained in various places was: "Apportioning shares, landlords controlling." Not only could they not make money, but they also lost their capital. The saying that cooperatives were "captured alive" spread from then on. People could not trust the cooperatives, and it created a stumbling block for the future development of the cooperative movement.
    The changes in the rural economy from 1939 to 1943 were very significant: first, the Party effectively implemented the policy of rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and the feudal landlords who were also commercial capitalists were severely weakened; second, the division and destruction by the Japanese invaders also made it impossible for the old commercial capital to continue to exist; third, the great flood of 1939 and the drought of 1943 severely damaged the lives of the peasants. Due to the emergence of the above conditions, the new situation in the countryside was: the old commercial capital that monopolized and exploited the peasants completely collapsed (including large grain shops, mountain product shops, cloth shops, and money shops); under the enemy's blockade and division, it was necessary to use new capital and new organizational methods to organize the export of agricultural products (such as walnuts, peppers, and pig bristles), and exchange them for necessities in the base areas (salt, cloth, and military industrial equipment necessary for the War of Resistance); and the peasants who were initially liberated from feudal shackles urgently needed organizational power to overcome disasters. The cooperative was redeveloped under these new conditions. If calculated from 1943, it has been exactly six years now (newly liberated areas after the Japanese invaders surrendered have only been three years, and cooperatives have only been around for more than two years). During this period, cooperatives in various places have experienced a large amount of development: according to statistics from 44 counties in the Beiyue District in 1946, village cooperatives developed to 8,342, and according to statistics from 29 counties in Taihang in 1947, village cooperatives developed to 5,370. According to statistics from Jizhong in 1946, village cooperatives developed to 3,948. In addition, Taiyue, Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji'nan and other districts have also had a certain amount of development. The organization of county and district joint cooperatives has also been established in many places. After 1945, Taihang established general organizations for cooperatives in Yubei, Jidong, and Jixi by region. In order to facilitate the cooperative business and the promotion of mass production, Jizhong and Beiyue successively established production promotion cooperatives above the county level. The road that millions of people and cadres in the entire region have experienced and explored in creating cooperative undertakings in the past six years is very complex and tortuous. The following can only be put forward for research based on some incomplete materials.
    First of all, from the development of village cooperatives, from the 34 village cooperatives in Jizhong, Beiyue, Taihang, and Taiyue counties that are considered to be relatively good, they are following three different development paths: The first path is to focus on supporting the masses' (or members') own production and supply and marketing businesses, and concurrently operate consumer businesses (some are completely production cooperatives). Because these cooperatives are mostly run by the masses themselves, or cadres combined with the masses, generally speaking, they can make full use of local production conditions and the masses' production time to organize the masses to make money. If the masses weave cloth and cannot sell it, the cooperative will sell it for them. If the masses are idle in winter and have nothing to do, the cooperative will organize them to dig medicinal materials, and help them with freight and transportation. The Fangnao Cooperative in Lincheng is called a model cooperative because it can organize the masses to engage in different sideline productions according to the season, such as beating black leaves to make paste, picking oak shells (the above two are dyes), cutting firewood, digging medicinal materials, and weaving, which increased the income of the masses and gained their support. In the Fuggezhuang Cooperative in Wenxin County, 74 people out of 64 members participated in various productions. If the masses lacked pots or cloth, the cooperative would organize the masses to grind rice to exchange for pots and cloth. The labor belongs to the masses themselves, and the benefits are also for the masses themselves. The North Changfeng Production Labor Cooperative in Wanxian is entirely invested by members, who elect their own cadres, buy production raw materials (willow strips) at low prices, and members participate in labor to weave willow cans, dustpans, etc., which are then sold by the cooperative. From cadres to members, they completely rely on labor dividends, rather than investment dividends. In the winter of 1944, many small-scale cooperatives organized by the masses themselves in Licheng, Pingshun and other counties in the Taihang area belonged to this type. The characteristics of these cooperatives are: 1. They have a foundation of conscious and voluntary production organization of the masses, and are generally consolidated. For example, the Fuggezhuang Cooperative has persisted for four years, and some have even persisted for six or seven years. 2. The cadre problem, which is generally difficult for cooperatives to solve, is easy to solve in this type of cooperative. However, the number of these cooperatives in the entire region is extremely small, and the most important reason for their failure to develop is the lack of strong support from the state in terms of supply and marketing. In 1945, I heard such an example: Xingtai was initially liberated, and vermicelli was very expensive. Many vermicelli workshops organized by farmers in Licheng vigorously purchased mung beans to make vermicelli. As a result, the price of mung beans was raised invisibly, resulting in overproduction of vermicelli, and the finished product was more expensive than the raw materials. Many vermicelli workshops therefore collapsed. Although this can only be said to be one of millions of examples, and it cannot be regarded as the only one, it has not been well resolved in recent years. The second path is to focus on operating the cooperative's own production and consumption business, and supplement it with driving the masses' production. The general development path of this type of cooperative is to first raise shares, and then open factories, workshops, and stores. If they do well, they can unite technical workers well, earn money to distribute dividends to the masses, and solve some problems for the masses. For example, the Dong Sanjiao Cooperative in Xianxian County drove the local women to spin and weave by opening its own textile factory, and contracted public shoes for the masses, with 60% of the village's households participating in cooperative labor. Weaving households rely on their own labor and the cooperative to earn wages. Another example is the People's Wood Factory in Lujiazhuang, Jin County, which not only solved the local masses' difficulties in repairing waterwheels, carts, and spinning wheels, but also distributed dividends on time and sold firewood to members at low prices. The cooperative in Dongguan Township, Hejian City, in addition to opening oil mills, wood factories, and brick kilns to earn money and distribute it uniformly, also organized the masses to contract construction of houses and transport bricks. Because these cooperatives have established connections with the economic lives of the masses, the masses cherish them and do not want them to lose money. However, this type of cooperative often has a difficult problem to solve in its path to development: that is, the contradiction between the masses (including non-members) and the dividends cannot be resolved. In order to guarantee the supply of cooperative cadres, to gain the support of members and to continue to expand share capital, it is necessary to expand business and try to make money, but earning profits is often contradictory to "serving the masses." Some of them have embarked on blindly pursuing profits and collapsed. The Lijia Yu Village Cooperative in Xingtai is one example, which opened a large freight yard in Xingtai City and lost money. There is a type that takes the path of "serving the masses," such as selling goods at low prices and paying high wages, but the cooperative cannot make money and cannot exist. The third type is that it can only meet the production and consumption needs of the masses to a certain extent, and its main purpose is to pursue profits and operate workshops and stores. The general development law of this type of cooperative is to develop first and then collapse. If it does well, it can only be a good consumer store; for example, the Consumer Cooperative in Wangpan Village, Qingyuan County, relies on the diligence and thrift of its employees, timely settlement of accounts, fair prices, and convenient purchases for the masses. The rights that members can obtain are to buy one or two kilograms of oil and vinegar cheaply during the New Year in addition to dividends. If the operation is not good, its own business often develops too much, it is difficult to operate, and it cannot make money; according to the statistics of 28 village cooperatives in Guzhen, Qinshui, etc., there are a total of 498 employees and workshop workers, of which 140 are employees and miscellaneous personnel who are not directly engaged in production, and an average of two workers have to support one employee. There are 136 workshops and outlets in 28 village cooperatives. The biggest problems with this type of cooperative are: 1. They are completely vulnerable to price fluctuations and market supply and demand changes. 2. The treatment of cooperative cadres and workers often becomes an intractable problem. If the treatment is high, the members are dissatisfied, and if the treatment is low, the cadres and workers are dissatisfied. 3. The masses do not care much about the cooperative. The masses only have a dividend relationship with the cooperative. If they make money, they invest, and if they lose money, they withdraw their shares.
    Among the above three types of village cooperatives, the third type accounts for the largest proportion, the first type is the least, and the second type is the second. Why do the masses need cooperatives but are not satisfied with them? From the above facts, we can find a clear answer: This means that although our cooperatives are owned by the farmers, their operating methods are basically capitalist in nature, except for the first type. The cooperative has become a store or factory that cannot exist without pursuing profits. Although it sometimes subjectively wants to serve the farmers and has come up with many methods and achieved certain results, in terms of results: First, the farmers cannot reduce the exploitation they suffer in the exchange relationship. Second, the cooperative cannot avoid the fate of destruction by participating in market competition.
    Because the development path of the cooperative is not clear in our minds, the county and district joint cooperatives organized on the basis of the village cooperatives are even more problematic. In addition to organizing a part of the supply and marketing business, it has completely lost contact with the masses; The Cixian County Joint Cooperative has a capital of 23.4 million yuan and has three outlets and a grain store, which are completely separated from the mass production business. The two production units operated by Wu'an Seventh District have 28 people separated from production personnel. There is trade competition between county and district joint cooperatives and village cooperatives, rather than mutual support. Commissioner Hou of the Sixth Administrative Office of Taihang pointed out in his summary that the county and district joint cooperatives are "government-run businesses," which is indeed reasonable.
    Looking at the production promotion cooperatives developed in Jizhong and Beiyue in the past year, they have played a certain role in promoting and organizing mass production, and changed the commercial speculation nature of the cooperatives. Its business is carried out with the general organizations above the county level as business units. It invests in agriculture and industry through state loans, directly supporting and organizing farmers' production. It uses loan funds to buy and repair waterwheels, buy livestock, and open farm tool factories... and then lends them to farmers; and cooperates with state-owned trade organs to organize supply and marketing. Taking the Hejian Promotion Cooperative as an example, according to statistics in August, it supported 36 villages through loans, forming 83 groups to carry out production such as weaving cloth, spinning thread, planting yam seedlings, and weaving. There are two problems with the development of the promotion cooperative at present: The first is the lack of grass-roots organizations that directly contact the masses. Although the amount of state investment is not too small (for example, the original Jin-Cha-Ji District alone loaned out thousands of waterwheels by the Border Region Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative), it has not organized the masses into cooperative economic teams. Therefore, whether in organizing the supply and marketing or production of the masses, it still cannot play its due role. In some places, the state investment is even regarded as a gift to the masses, and it is distributed irresponsibly; Jizhong Boye County lost more than 50,000 kilograms of millet because of this. The second is that it does not cooperate well with state-owned trade organs. There are often contradictions in business. The promotion cooperative has a simple dependence mentality, wanting to rely on the trade organs to handle everything, but the trade organs change due to market demand, and when the turnover is not smooth, they cannot notify the situation in time. If the above problems are not resolved, it will be difficult for the promotion cooperative to promote the cooperative movement to the correct path.
    The historical process is seen very clearly. Although we have achieved great results in the cooperative work: such as accumulating funds, training cadres, organizing the masses to overcome disasters, and helping the masses solve some supply and marketing problems, our cooperative movement has not yet embarked on the right path, and the vast number of peasants and small producers have not yet been organized; the government has not given the necessary strong support. If the cooperative economy occupies a pivotal position in the new democratic economy, then we must make greater efforts.
    Lessons to be Learned and the Road Ahead
    We have made many efforts in the history of cooperatives, especially in conjunction with the correction work in the past year, and various places have been vigorously rectifying the cooperatives. The biggest achievement in the rectification is the liquidation and correction of the "leftist" deviations in the cooperative work; such as the re-replacement of incompetent poor peasant chairmen and the resolution of the freezing of so-called landlord and rich peasant funds. However, according to the materials summarized by Licheng, Pingshun, Taihang Sixth Special District, and Third Special District, the rectification has generally failed to thoroughly solve the problem of the future path of the cooperative. They unanimously requested to start from the following three issues to establish a solid foundation for the cooperative: The first is the external debt problem; the second is the cadre treatment problem; and the third is the democratic system problem. Are these issues the central link of the cooperative problem? I think it is worth considering. In history, many cooperatives have collapsed and been rectified continuously, always circling around these issues, but circling around and around, they still return to the old path. Now I think it should be time for us to wake up. The basic issues of the cooperative are the close economic ties with the masses and the organizational leadership of the state, and both are indispensable. If the cooperative has not yet established a solid relationship with the masses, and then goes to solve the cadre problem and the democratic system problem, it can only be "looking for fish in a tree." A farmer in Linxian said well during the rectification of the cooperative: "You (referring to the village-level cooperative cadres) lead others to produce all day long, but you have left your own land barren, which is really strange." The democratic system is an old tune that has been played for several years, and it is always mentioned and can never be resolved. As for the impact of external debt on the cooperative, although it is large, repaying the external debt does not mean that the cooperative can be run well.
    Cooperative work should open up a new path
    First, the state must control the leadership of the cooperative. Lenin pointed out in his article "On Cooperation": "Indeed, the state controls all major means of production, the proletariat holds state power, and the proletariat forms an alliance with millions of small and smallest peasants. The proletariat has a guarantee to lead the peasants, etc., - is this not everything necessary for us to build a complete socialist society successfully through cooperatives, and only through cooperatives, through the trading organs that we used to despise, and at present, under the circumstances of the New Economic Policy, we also have reason to despise cooperatives to a certain extent?" What Lenin said is the issue of cooperatives during the period of building socialism, but I think it can inspire us to clarify an important truth: that is, when our party has become the party leading the state power, and has the power to control all major means of production, we must unite all the peasants through cooperatives. This means that although our party has led the peasants in the liberated areas to complete the land reform that has not been completed for nearly a hundred years, and on this basis, will completely destroy Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule, if we cannot make good use of the power of the state to organize the peasants to move towards the path of cooperative economy, then although we have united the peasants in the past, we will soon lose them. When Japanese imperialism was still trampling on the vast rural areas of China, it used great efforts to run cooperatives, but the purpose of running cooperatives was to completely control the agricultural products of Chinese farmers. Through cooperatives, it unfairly plundered the agricultural products of farmers. Therefore, farmers hate such cooperatives. The capitalists of the bourgeois countries also run cooperatives, except that the method is not completely violent and coercive, it is also for the purpose of achieving plunder and monopoly. Our cooperative should be completely different from this. Our policy should be to consciously organize the vast number of small producers to increase various kinds of production in a planned way, and organize production cooperatives; on the other hand, the state should organize large-scale supply and marketing cooperatives to support them. The supply and marketing cooperative not only solves the supply of raw materials and the promotion of finished products, but also needs to operate consumer business to distribute necessities to farmers participating in the cooperative at no profit with the power of the state. Capitalists and imperialists organize cooperatives for monopoly and exploitation; we organize cooperatives to make them a "ladder of private interests, private business interests, and state inspection and supervision of these interests." (Lenin on Cooperation) This is the principled difference between us and the bourgeoisie in dealing with the peasant problem. But if we check with this standard, our past efforts in this area have been very insufficient. For five or six years, our leadership over the cooperative has been completely laissez-faire, and lacks state support. We have allowed the cooperative to embark on the road of commercialization and lack specific measures, and even we ourselves have tried to operate this "store" that is completely separated from the interests of the farmers. If the cooperative is to be run well in the future, state leadership is the first condition.
    Second, is it everything with state support? No, the production promotion cooperative we have established is state capital, but why has it not been able to lead the peasants to the path of cooperation? This means that we must also have correct leadership methods, and we must make our cooperative cause completely based on a solid mass foundation. At present, we still lack experience in this area, and many old paths cannot be followed. We must adopt a key breakthrough method, and use a part of strong cadres to try it out in a few villages. In the beginning, we can use the power of state investment to organize farmers to participate in cooperation, and distribute consumer goods that are cheaper than the market price to farmers who voluntarily participate in the cooperative, and then gradually organize farmers who voluntarily participate in cooperation to invest shares, and gradually organize product promotion work. There must be a difference between members and non-members. As for the dividend issue, it should be the second issue. Only when the farmers personally experience the benefits of the cooperative, can we adopt the method of training courses to gradually promote it, and the movement will slowly be promoted. Only by doing this grass-roots work well can we guarantee that we will organize the vast number of small producers and farmers to participate in the ranks of the cooperative economy. What the past production promotion cooperative work lacked was precisely this aspect.
    Third, the state supply and marketing cooperative must support all production cooperative organizations (including labor mutual aid groups and various small workshops) voluntarily organized by the masses. The support mentioned here is not to help them expand and establish a set of formal systems, but to provide necessary assistance in the promotion of products, the supply of production tools and raw materials, and the reduction of production blindness. Past experience has long proven that the scale of production cooperation cannot be large, if it is large, it will be forced and will collapse; if we have the help of the state, and if we can adhere to the principle of voluntariness to organize mass production cooperation, this mass cooperative organization will develop in large numbers.
    Fourth, the attitude towards the old cooperative: If we want to organize a lot of strength to rectify the cooperative, it is better to organize some strength to carry out new experiments. (However, the sorting out of external debts, the rational use of funds, and even striving for necessary opening are still needed; because otherwise, the loss of funds and goods will be too great, which is not good for the masses.) Some production cooperative organizations that have always been consciously and voluntarily organized by the masses, such as the first type of cooperative organizations we mentioned earlier, will slowly enter the ranks of the movement in the key breakthroughs we are doing. And some purely store-like cooperatives will slowly be eliminated or change their business methods in the movement. Don't immediately negate everything, as this will cause large economic fluctuations, which is not good for the people.
    In short, although we have five or six years of experience in developing the rural cooperative movement, it is still a new topic for completing the new historical task. The above are some fragmented experiences from personal reading of materials and studying documents, and I would like to put them forward for discussion with everyone.

　　农村合作经济的道路
    丁昆
  　鲜明的对照
    千百万的农民及小生产者，是十分需要合作社的，没有合作社，他们将无法解脱贫穷。东焦村（获鹿县属）的一个农民告诉我，他刨了两天黄芩（药材）拿到集上卖，卖来卖去，不如卖柴。村里虽然经过土地改革，但连着两年歉收。另一个新翻身的农民很坦白的对我说：“新世道不如旧世道，以前碰了歉年，卖地借钱有个活路，如今分地翻身倒也好，但碰上这个时候，就很少有办法。”道理是很明显的，两个农民的谈话是一个意思，就是要求组织他们开辟财源。东焦村这样一个千把户人家的村庄，眼看明春就有许多农民不可避免饥饿的威胁，但因为没有合作社的组织，大批劳力在街头闲散着。问题不是很明白吗？没有合作社的组织力量，个体的农民是无法与穷困作斗争的。但东焦村的情况，只能说明问题的一面，我们全华北解放区的多数地区，是组织了合作社的：仅太行、北岳两地一九四六年统计，合作社即已达行政村的百分之五十七以上。许多农民是亲身体验到合作社的好处的。和顺龙旺村农民想以自己所生产的麻去换些必需品，但在本乡卖比送到城里卖要贱一倍，商人从中就要得一倍的利益。假如合作社把农民的麻集中起来，担到城里，并换回必需品，从中只扣脚价，卖出的东西长了钱，买进的东西价又贱，一里一外，农民就得了利益。武安下三里庄合作社，组织妇女纺花，换买水车十七辆，大大便利与提高了农民生产。……太行不少县份由于有了合作社，组织一切可能组织的劳动力纺花、运输、割柴，得以渡过了一九四三年的严重灾荒。由此可见农民是十分需要合作社的，他们的生产资料与生活资料要求合作社供给，他们的生产成品又要求合作社推销。当党还没有取得政权、农村济经还被地主阶级与旧的商业资本掌握着它的命脉的时候，农民是依靠商人与市场发生交换关系的；因而他们也就不能避免商人对他们的中间剥削。今天他们是要求依靠人民自己的政府所领导的合作社来解决这个问题的。但几年来这个问题一直解决得不好，人民对于合作社，并不是完全拥护的。合作社本身也经常处于风雨飘摇中，前年一年垮台了的合作社一般均达百分之七八十。经过去年一年整顿，现据太行行署的统计，才只整顿了五分之一。整顿过的合作社，有很多只能做到勉强开门。平顺回源头村合作社刚整顿过五天，新外欠即达五十万元。涉县杨家庄合作社，整顿后准备到河南店（镇）作生意。长治一区二十四个合作社，整顿后被认为业务方向不正确的仍占十六个。为什么几年来的合作社一直做得不好？这就必需从历史上去考查原因，并从中取得教训。
    历史回忆
    远在抗战开始，我党创建根据地的初期，随着抗日民主政权的建立，原晋察冀和原晋冀鲁豫区的广大农村，均曾创办过合作社。当时党虽然已经取得了对政权的领导，但实行减租减息政策，还只是开始，广大农民还没有自己起来从封建压迫中求到解放，当时就在组织合作社的工作上提出了“村村有社、人人入社”的口号是错误的。各地所得到的结果是：“摊派股金，地主掌握。”不只赚不了钱，连老本都蚀光了。合作社是“活捉社”的说法，从此也就流传开来。人民不能相信合作社，并给以后开展合作运动制造了绊脚石。
    从一九三九年到一九四三年农村经济的变化是很大的：第一是党切实执行了减租减息政策，此时兼商业资本家的封建地主，受到了应有的严重的削弱；第二是日寇的分割与摧残，也使旧的商业资本不能再维持下去；第三是一九三九年的大水灾与一九四三年的旱灾，农民生活受到严重破坏。由于以上条件的产生，农村里新的情况是：垄断与剥削农民的旧商业资本完全垮台（包括大的粮行、山货栈、布庄、钱庄等）；在敌人封锁与分割的情况下，必须以新的资本和新的组织方法去组织农业生产品的输出（如核桃、花椒、猪鬃等），并换回根据地的必需品（盐、布匹、及为抗战所必需的军工器材等）；在封建束缚下初解放的农民极需组织力量战胜灾荒。合作社就是在这种新的条件下又重新发展起来的。如果从一九四三年算起的话，到现在已是整整六年时间了（日寇投降后新解放地区才只三年，合作社大约有二年多的历史）。在此期间，各地合作社均曾有过大量的发展：据北岳区四十四个县一九四六年的统计，村社发展到八千三百四十二个，太行二十九个县一九四七年的统计，村社发展到五千三百七十个。冀中一九四六年统计，村社发展到三千九百四十八个。此外，太岳、冀鲁豫、冀南等区，均有一定数量的发展。县区联社的组织，也在不少地方建立起来了。一九四五年后，太行曾以地区建立豫北、晋东、冀西等合作社总的组织，冀中、北岳为便利合作事业及群众生产事业的推动，并曾先后在县以上成立了生产推进社。全区千百万群众和干部六年来在创建合作事业中，所经历与摸索的道路，是十分复杂与曲折的。下面只能就所获得一些不完整的材料，提出研究。
    首先从村社的发展情况来看，从冀中、北岳、太行、太本岳各县所认为比较好的三十四个村社中去考查，他们在走着三种不同的发展道路：第一种道路：是以扶植群众（或社员）自己的生产与供销事业为主，兼营消费业务（有的则系完全的生产合作社）。由于这类合作社多是由群众自己办，或干部结合着群众办。一般的讲它能充分利用当地的生产条件与群众的生产时间组织群众赚钱，群众织了布卖不出，合作社便替它卖，群众冬闲了无事做，合作社便组织他们刨药材，替他们揽脚、运输。临城的方瑙合作社被称为模范合作社，就是因为它能按季节去组织群众进行打黑叶熬膏、拾橡壳、（以上两种均系染料）打柴、刨药材、纺织等不同的副业生产，增加了群众收入而取得了群众拥护。文新县富各庄合作社，社员六十四户中，即有七十四人参加各种不同的生产，群众缺锅缺布，合作社便组织群众碾稻米换锅换布，劳力是群众自己的，得利的也是群众自己。完县北常丰的生产劳动社，完全是社员自己投资，自己选出干部，贱价买来生产原料（柳条），社员自己参加劳动，编成柳罐、簸箕等，再由社内卖出，从干部到社员完全是依靠劳动分红，而不是依照投资分红。一九四四年冬季，太行区的黎城、平顺等县，群众自己组织起来的小型社，很多属于此类性质。这类合作社的特点是：一、有群众自觉自愿的生产组织做基础，在一般情况下是巩固的，如富各庄的合作社就已坚持了四年，有个别的甚至坚持六、七年之久的。二、一般合作社所不易解决的干部问题，在这类合作社中易得到解决。但这类合作社在全区的数量是极少的，其不能发展的最主要原因是在供销方面缺乏国家的有力扶植，一九四五年我曾听到过这样的例子：邢台初解放，粉条很贵，黎城许多农民所组织的粉坊便大力收购绿豆造粉，这样一来，就无形中把绿豆的价格提高了，结果粉条生产过剩，成品还不如原料贵，不少粉坊因此垮台。虽然，这只能说是千百万事例中的一个，而且不能将它当做唯一的，但几年来并未求得很好解决。第二种道路是以经营合作社本身的生产与消费业务为主，而以带动群众的生产为副。这类合作社的发展道路一般的是先集股，而后开办工厂、作坊及商店。做的好的能很好的团结技术工人，能赚钱给群众分红，给群众解决一些问题。如献县东三角合作社是以自己开办纺织工厂而带动了当地的妇女纺织，并为群众揽公鞋做，卷入合作社劳动的占全村户数的百分之六十。纺织户以自己的劳动，依靠合作社赚得工资。再如晋县吕家庄的民众木厂，不仅解决了当地群众修理水车、大车、纺车等困难，而且按期分红，贱价卖给社员木柴。河间市东关乡的合作社，除开油坊，木厂、砖窑等赚钱统一分红外，并组织群众包工盖房、运砖等。这类合作社由于与群众的经济生活，已经建立了联系，因此群众对于它是爱护的，不愿它赔钱。但这类合作社在向前发展的道路中，往往存在着一个不易解决的难题：即为群众（包括非社员在内的群众）与分红的矛盾不能解决。为了保障合作社干部的供给，为了取得社员的拥护与继续扩大股金，不得不扩大业务，想办法赚钱，但赚钱营利又往往与“为群众”是矛盾的。这其中有的是走上盲目追求利润垮了台，邢台李家峪村合作社即其一例，在邢台市大开货栈花坊赊了本。有一类走着“为群众”的道路，如贱价卖货，多付工资等，但合作社不能赚钱，本身就无法存在。第三类：是只能在一定程度上满足群众的生产与消费的要求，以追求利润为主要目的、经营作坊、商店等。这类合作社一般的发展规律是先发展后垮台。作的好的，也只能是一个好的消费商店；如清苑县王盘村的消费合作社，依靠职员的勤俭，及时结帐，价钱公道，群众买东西方便，社员所能得到的权利是能除分红而外，过年时贱买一二斤油醋。经营不好的，往往是自身的业务发展得太大，不好经营，又不能赚钱；沁水固镇等二十八个村合作社的统计，职员和作坊工人共四百九十八人，其中不直接从事生产的职员，杂务人员就有一百四十人，平均两个工人就得养活一个职员。二十八个村社，作坊门市部就有一百三十六处。这类合作社的最大问题是：一、完全经不起物价波动与市场供求变化的影响。二、合作社干部待遇，工人待遇常常成为不可解决的难题。待遇高了，社员不满，待遇低了，干部工人不满。三、群众不大关心合作社，群众与合作社只有分红的关系，赚了就投资，赔了就抽股。
    以上三类村社就其比重而言，以第三类为最多，第一类最少，第二类次之。群众为什么需要合作社而又不满意合作社呢？从以上的事实中我们可以找到了明确的解答：这就是说虽然我们的合作社是农民东家，但除第一类外，其经营方法基本上是资本主义性质的。合作社变成了不追逐利润不能存在的商店或工厂，虽然有时主观上亦很想为农民服务，亦曾经想了许多办法而且获得了一定的成绩，但就其结果而言：第一农民不能减轻在交换关系中的所受剥削。第二合作社身在参加市场竞争中不可能避免覆灭的命运。
    由于合作社的发展道路，在我们的头脑中并不明确。因此，在村社的基础上所组织起来的县、区联社就更成问题了，它本身除组织一部分供销业务外，完全失掉了与群众的联系；磁县县联社资金两千三百四十万元，即开设着三个门市部，一个粮店，是与群众的生产事业完全脱节的。武安七区自己经营的两个生产单位，脱离生产人员达二十八人。县、区联社与村社之间，是贸易竞争，而不是相互扶持。太行六专署侯专员在总结中指出：县、区联社是“官办商业”，确有其一定的道理。
    再从近一年来在冀中、北岳所发展的生产推进社看，在推动与组织群众生产事业上，曾起了一定的作用，改变了合作社的商业投机性质。它的业务，是以县以上的各级总的组织为业务单位开展起来的。它通过国家贷款对农工业投资，直接扶助与组织农民生产。以贷款的资金买修水车、买牲畜、开农具厂……………而后贷给农民；并与公营的贸易机关配合，组织供销。以河间推进社为例，八月份统计，通过贷款扶助三十六村，组成八十三个小组进行织布、纺线、下山药秧、编织等生产。推进社在目前发展中所存在的问题有两个：第一是缺乏直接联系群众的基层组织，国家的投资数量虽然也不太少（如原晋察冀区仅边区水利推进社即贷出水车千辆），但并没有把群众组织到合作性的经济队伍里来。因而无论在组织群众的供销也好、生产也好，仍不能发挥其应有的作用，有的地方甚至把国家投资当做对群众恩赐，不负责任的进行发放；冀中博野县即因此赔出小米五万多斤。第二是与公营贸易机关配合不好，业务上经常矛盾，推进社有单纯依赖思想，一切货物想依靠贸易机关大包干，而贸易机关则因市场的需求有变化，当周转不灵时，又不能将情况及早通知。以上的问题不解决，推进社是很难把合作运动推进到正确的道路上去的。
    历史的过程是被看得很明白的，虽然我们曾经在合作社工作上取得了很大成绩：如积累了资金，培养了干部，组织群众渡过了灾荒，帮助群众解决了一些供销问题等，但我们的合作运动还没有走上正路，广大农民及小生产者还没有组织起来；政府也没有给以必要的有力扶助。如果说合作经济在新民主主义经济中是占着举足轻重的位置的话，那我们还必须做更大努力。
    应得的教训与今后的道路
    我们在历史上对合作社是曾作过很多努力的，特别是结合一年来的纠偏工作，各地均在大力整顿合作社。整顿中的最大成绩是清算与纠正了合作社工作中左倾偏向；如重新调换了不称职的贫农社长，及冻结所谓地主富农的资金的解决等。但依据黎城、平顺、太行六专、三专已总结起来的材料看，整顿中普遍并未能澈底解决今后合作社的道路问题，他们一致的都要求从下三个问题入手，建立合作社的巩固基础；第一是外欠问题；第二是干部待遇问题；第三是民主制度问题。这些问题是不是合作社问题的中心环节呢？我想是值得考虑的，历史上许多合作社不断垮台不断整顿，总是常在这几个问题上打圈子，但绕来绕去仍绕到老路上。现在我想应该是我们清醒起来的时候了。合作社的基本问题是与群众密切的经济联系与国家的组织领导问题，二者缺一不可。如果合作社还没和群众建立巩固的联系，就去解决干部问题与民主制度问题，那只能是“缘木求鱼”。林县整顿合作社中一个农民说得好：“你们（指村级的合作社干部）整天领导别人生产，自己却把地荒了，真是怪事”。民主制度，那更是几年来的老调子，什么时候也提，什么时候也解决不了。至于外欠对合作社影响虽大，但还了外欠并不等于就能把合作社办得好。
    合作社工作应该开辟新的道路
    第一、国家必须掌握对合作社的领导。列宁在论合作制一文中指出：“的确，国家支配着一切大生产资料，无产阶级执掌着国家政权，无产阶级与千百万小农及最小农结成联盟。无产阶级有对农民实行领导的保证等等，——难道这不是我们经过合作社，而且仅仅经过合作社，经过我们从前所鄙视为买卖机关，并且现时在新经济政策情形下，我们从某一方面也有理由这样来鄙视合作社，便把完备社会主义社会建设成功所必需的一切吗？”列宁所说的虽然是走向社会主义建设期间的合作社问题，但我认为可以启示我们明确一个重要道理：这就是当我们党已经成为领导国家政权的党，已经有了力量支配一切大的生产资料的时候，我们要团结全体农民必须经过合作社，这里就是说，我们的党虽然已经领导解放区农民完成近百年来所未完成的土地改革，并在这个基础上，将要完全摧毁蒋介石的卖国统治，但我们如果不能很好运用国家政权的力量，来组织农民走向合作经济道路的话，那我们过去虽然团结了农民，不久仍会失掉他们。当日本帝国主义还践踏着中国的广大的农村的时候，他曾经用了很大的力量来办合作社，但他办合作社的目的，是为了把中国农民的生产品完全统治起来，它经过合作社，不公道的把农民生产品掠夺了去。因此，农民对于这样的合作社是痛恨的。资产阶级国家的资本家，也开办合作社，除了在方法上不是完全的暴掠强制外，它同样的是为了达到掠夺与垄断的目的。我们的合作社，应该与此完全不同，我们的方针应该是一方面组织广大小生产者自觉的组织起来，有计划地增加各式各样的生产，组织生产合作社；另一方面国家要组织大规模的供销社给以扶植，供销社不只解决原料的供给与成品的推销问题，而且这需要兼营消费业务，以国家的力量，不营利地配给参加合作社的农民以必需品。资本家和帝国主义组织合作社是为了垄断、剥削；我们组织合作社是要使之成为“私人利益、私人营业利益以及由国家来检查与监督这一利益的梯级。”（列宁论合作制）这就是我们在对待农民问题上与资产阶级的原则区别。但如果以此尺度来检查的话，我们过去在这方面所做的努力是很不够的，五、六年来我们对合作社的领导，是完全自流的，是缺乏国家的扶植的。我们任凭合作社走上商业化的道路而缺少具体办法，甚至我们自身也去努力经营这种完全脱离农民利益的“商店”。今后合作社要办好，国家的领导是第一个条件。
    第二、有了国家的扶植是不是就有了一切呢？不是的，我们所举办的生产推进社就是国家资本，但为什么还没有能领导农民走向合作化的道路呢？这就是说，我们还必须有正确的领导方法，还必须使我们的合作事业完全建立在巩固的群众基础上。目前我们在这方面还缺少经验，旧的道路有很多是走不通的。这就必须采取重点突破的办法，要以一部分强有力干部在少数村庄试办，开始可用国家投资的力量来组织农民参加合作，以贱于市价的消费品配给给自愿参加合作社的农民，而后逐步组织自愿参加合作的农民入股，并逐步组织产品推销工作。社员与非社员必须是有区别的，至于分红问题则应该是其次的问题。只有当农民亲身体验到合作社的好处之后，可以采取训练班的方式，逐步推广，运动就会慢慢推动起来的。只有把这种基层的工作做好，我们组织广大小生产者及农民参加合作经济的行列，才算有了保证。过去生产推进社工作所缺乏的，也正是这一方面。
    第三、对于群众自愿组织起来的一切生产合作组织（包括劳动互助组及各种小型作坊），国家的供销社必须给以扶植。这里所说扶植不是去帮助他们扩大，建立一套形式的制度，而是在产品的推销上，生产工具与原料的供给上，以及减少生产的盲目性上等给以必要的扶助。过去的经验早证明过，生产合作规模不能大，大了就要强迫，就要垮台；如果有了国家的帮助，如果我们能坚持自愿原则去组织群众的生产合作，这种群众的合作组织是会大量发展起来的。
    第四、对旧有合作社的态度：如果说我们要组织很大力量去进行合作社的整顿的话，倒不如组织一些力量进行新的试验。（但外欠的整理，资金的合理运用，以至争取必要的开门还是需要的；因为不如此，资金货物的损失太大，对群众是不利的。）一些历来是群众所自觉自愿组织起来的生产合作社，如我们前面所说的那种第一类合作社的组织，在我们所做的重点突破过程中，是会慢慢的走进运动的行列中来的。而一些纯商店性的合作社，就会慢慢在运动中被淘汰或改变其业务经营的办法的。不要马上一切否定，这样会形成经济上大的波动，对于人民也不利。
    总之，开展农村合作运动虽然我们已有五、六年的经验，但对完成新的历史任务来说，还是一个新的课题。以上是个人翻阅材料与学习文件中的一些片断的体会，愿提出与大家共同商讨。
