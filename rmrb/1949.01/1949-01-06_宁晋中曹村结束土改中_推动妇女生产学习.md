　　[Report from this newspaper] Before the land reform in Zhong Cao Village, Ningjin County's Sixth District, there were 168 women members, but the organization gradually collapsed. During the conclusion of the land reform this time, district cadres discovered the following problems in the village's women's work: First, the cadres were not responsible, simply shouting at the door when it was time for a meeting, without clarifying the time and place, making it impossible for those willing to participate to find the meeting. Second, the masses were busy and afraid of delaying their work. Third, young women and older, stronger women had different needs and could not be convened in the same meeting.

　　Based on this situation, it was decided to hold meetings according to age, street, and area, and to establish women's organizations by organizing production. At the first symposium of older, stronger women in the South Street area, more than 40 people arrived in a short time. First, the issue of paying cloth was studied, and then the issue of carrying out textile production in the winter was discussed. Everyone pointed out in their speeches that they lacked the time and that some knew how to weave but not how to spin. At this time, everyone came up with the idea of ​​collaborative weaving. An old woman who could spin but couldn't see well to weave teamed up with a weaver. When other streets held meetings, many people also arrived, and the mood was good. In this way, ninety-eight people were organized, freely forming twelve groups.

　　When organizing young women, active elements were discovered by utilizing the natural textile opportunities of the women, strengthening study and education to stimulate learning enthusiasm, and having active elements connect with other young women to organize literacy classes. At first, district cadres personally taught classes, but later, because they were busy with work and did not have time, fewer people studied. The district cadres reviewed that this was a mistake of paternalism and convened a meeting of party members and cadres, explaining that the branch and all cadres were responsible for running the village's winter school well, and selected woman Li Xiaoping as a teacher, stipulating the time and place. The cadres then held women's forums by street and area to mobilize women to go to school. As a result, even more people came, with about fifty people going to study every day. When they went, they brought crutches and thread, without delaying production. They learned three characters every day and also talked about the newspaper and the content of the concluded land reform. The learning enthusiasm of the people was very good.

　　宁晋中曹村结束土改中
  　推动妇女生产学习
    【本报讯】宁晋县六区中曹村土改前有一百六十八个妇女会员，后逐渐垮台。这次结束土改中，区干部发现该村妇女工作上存在以下几个问题：一是干部不负责任，开会的时候在门口喊一声，也不说清时间地点，有愿意参加会的也没法去找；二是群众忙，怕耽误作活。三是青年妇女和老壮年妇女要求不一样，开会也开不到一块。
    根据这个情况，便决定按年龄分街分片来开会，从组织生产来建立妇女组织。在第一次召开的南街老壮年妇女座谈会，工夫不大就到了四十多人，先研究了缴布，接着就讨论冬天开展纺织问题，大家在发言中提出：工夫缺少，有的会织不会纺。这时大家想出搭插织布。有一个老婆会纺线看不见织布就和织布的插起来。别的街在开会时人也到的挺多，情绪挺好。这样就组织起九十八个人，自由结合成十二个组。
    在组织青年妇女时，是利用妇女自然纺织场合发现积极分子，加强学习教育启发学习情绪，由积极分子去串通别的青年妇女组织识字班。起先，是区干部亲自上课，后来因为工作忙没时间，学习的人就少了，区干部检讨出这是犯了包办代替的毛病，就又召开了党员会、干部会，说明办好本村冬学，支部和全体干部都有责任，并选出妇女李小平当教员，规定了时间地点，干部们便分街分片召开妇女座谈会，发动妇女上学。这样一来，人更多了，每天有五十左右的人去学习。去时拿着拐子拐线，也不耽误生产，每天学三字，还讲报纸和结束土改的内容，人们学习情绪都挺好。
