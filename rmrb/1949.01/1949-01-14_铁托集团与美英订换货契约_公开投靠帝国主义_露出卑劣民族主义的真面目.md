Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 11th: The Yugoslav Tito Group has openly defected to the imperialist camp economically. On December 27th of last year, the Tito Group signed a barter agreement for 1949 with Britain, stipulating that the two parties would exchange goods worth 15 million pounds. During negotiations with Britain, representatives of the Tito Group mentioned that they would conclude a commercial agreement with Italy, and thereby enter into a contract with the Marshall Plan. This open betrayal and embrace of the imperialist camp by the Tito Group has been appreciated by US imperialism. As early as December 9th of last year, a US State Department spokesperson stated that Yugoslavia was part of the US's entire plan to "develop world trade," that the US was "extremely interested" in trade with Yugoslavia, and would "soon ease restrictions on trade with the South," and so on. At the end of last year, US officials revealed that the purpose of this move by the US was to eagerly exploit the Tito Group to strengthen the US position in the "Cold War" against the Soviet Union.

On the same day that the Anglo-Yugoslav agreement was signed, Tito delivered a speech at a joint session of the two houses of the Yugoslav parliament, sophistically defending his reactionary policy of opposing the Soviet Union and embracing imperialism. In his speech, Tito falsely accused the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe of wanting to keep Yugoslavia as an agricultural country that supplied raw materials.

The Telecommunications Agency commented: Tito's condemnation is not surprising. It was only a matter of time before the Tito Group openly admitted its decision to base the economic foundations of Yugoslav "socialism" on the support of imperialist countries. Tito's condemnation is clearly intended to conceal the actual obligations it has already undertaken to Western countries, and the proposed treaty with Italy and thus the contract with the Marshall Plan; it is intended to stir up despicable chauvinist sentiments to evade the responsibility of the Tito Group for the rapidly deteriorating economic crisis at home. Titoism has thus finally exposed the true face of "socialism" built on nationalism, the most despicable form. It has fallen into the trap set by the drafters of the Marshall Plan. Under the rule of the Tito Group, Yugoslavia will inevitably fall into a state of despair, with no other way out than to absolutely and openly accept suicidal "aid," which has already placed many countries in a state of economic ruin and political chaos.

### 铁托集团与美英订换货契约　公开投靠帝国主义　露出卑劣民族主义的真面目

　　铁托集团与美英订换货契约
  　公开投靠帝国主义
  　露出卑劣民族主义的真面目
    【新华社陕北十一日电】南斯拉夫铁托集团在经济上已公开投靠帝国主义阵营。铁托集团于去年十二月二十七日与英国签订了一九四九年换货协定，规定双方交换价值一千五百万英镑的货物。在与英国谈判时，铁托集团的代表们会提到将与意大利订立商约，并从而与马歇尔计划订立契约。铁托集团这种公开卖身投靠帝国主义阵营的作法，得到了美帝国主义的赏识。早在去年十二月九日，美国务院发言人即曾声明：南斯拉夫为美国“发展世界贸易”整个计划的一部分，美国对于对南斯拉夫贸易“极感兴趣”，并“即将放宽对南贸易的限制”等等。去年年底，美官方人士曾透露，美国此举的目的，是亟欲利用铁托集团以加强美国在对苏“冷战”中的地位。
    在签订英南协定的同日，铁托在南斯拉夫议会两院联席会议上发表演说，为自己反对苏联而投靠帝国主义的反动政策诡辩。铁托在演说中诬蔑苏联及东欧各新民主国家要保持南斯拉夫为一个供应原料的农业国家。
    电通社评称：铁托的这种谴责，并不令人惊奇。因为铁托集团之公开承认其决定将南斯拉夫“社会主义”的经济基础建立在各帝国主义国家的支持之上，本来只是时间问题。铁托的谴责，分明是想掩饰其对西方各国所已承担的实际义务，及拟议中的与意大利签订条约并从而与马歇尔计划立约；是想激起卑鄙的沙文主义的情绪，以摆脱铁托集团对国内迅速恶化的经济危机应负的责任。铁托主义由此已最后暴露了建立在民族主义这个最卑劣的形式之上的“社会主义”的真面目。它已堕入了马歇尔计划制订人所设下的陷阱。在铁托集团统治下，南斯拉夫必将陷于绝望之境，除了绝对与公开地接受自杀的“援助”以外，别无他途，而这种“援助”业已将许多国家置于经济上毁灭与政治上混乱的境地。
