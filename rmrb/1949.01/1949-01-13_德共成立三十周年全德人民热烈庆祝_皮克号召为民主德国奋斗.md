Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS, Berlin - December 30, 1948, German democrats and progressive newspapers widely celebrated the 30th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party. Berlin newspapers published an outline of a broadcast speech by former Communist leader and current Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, Pieck. The speech discussed the policies of the German Communist Party since 1945, stating: The Communist Party has devoted all its efforts to ensuring that the crimes of the corrupt Germans are exposed. Together with our Social Democratic comrades, the Communist Party has begun to establish the unity of the socialist working-class movement and has become the mainstay of all anti-fascist and democratic forces in the country. Pieck then declared: In the Soviet occupation zone, new state institutions have been established, with representatives of the working class holding key positions. The land of the Junkers has been returned to the working peasants, and the enterprises of monopoly capital have become state property. For the first time in German history, an economic plan has been drafted, thereby establishing the basis for further improvement of the economy and further improvement of the material and cultural welfare of the people. Pieck finally pointed out: In West Germany, the power of monopoly capital is being restored, the American plan to turn West Germany into a colony is being implemented, and the Ruhr is being cut off. The task of the Communist Parties of West and South Germany is to continue the struggle for the unity of the working class, the unity of Germany, and a just peace, and to continue the struggle against the Marshall Plan and the colonization of West Germany.

　　德共成立三十周年全德人民热烈庆祝
  　皮克号召为民主德国奋斗
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社柏林讯：一九四八年十二月三十日，德国民主人士及进步报纸广泛庆祝德国共产党创立三十周年。柏林报纸登载前共产党领袖、现任统一社会党主席皮克的广播演词的纲要。演词论述一九四五年以来德国共产党的政策称：共产党曾致全力于使腐化的德国人的罪恶受到检举。与我们的社会民主党同志一起，共产党已开始建立社会主义的工人阶级运动的统一，并已成为国内一切反法西斯力量及民主力量的中坚。皮克继而宣称：在苏占区，新的国家机构已经建立起来，其枢纽职位由工人阶级的代表担任。容克贵族们的土地，已被交回劳动农民，垄断资本的企业，已成为国家的财产。在德国的历史上，许多年来第一次拟制了经济计划，因而确立了经济之进一步提高和人民的物质及文化福利之进一步改善的基础。皮克最后指出：在西德，垄断资本的权力正被恢复，美国使西德国家殖民地化的计划正在实施，鲁尔正被割掉。西德及南德共产党的任务是继续进行斗争，以争取工人阶级的统一、德国的统一及公正的和平，继续进行斗争，以反对马歇尔计划及西德的殖民地化。
