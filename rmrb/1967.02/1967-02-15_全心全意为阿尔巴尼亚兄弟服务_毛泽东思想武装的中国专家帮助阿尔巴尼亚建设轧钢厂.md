In the spring of 1964, when flowers were in full bloom, a group of Chinese experts, carrying the red "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," arrived in the heroic country of Albania, which stands on the Adriatic coast. They came to Albania to help build the Elbasan Steel Rolling Mill according to the Sino-Albanian economic and technological cooperation agreement.

Under the guidance of the Chinese experts, after two years of intense construction, the Elbasan Steel Rolling Mill successfully rolled its first steel on the evening of March 23rd of the previous year. This was an extraordinary moment! From then on, Albania had its own steel production. That night, the steel rods rolled out were like flying dragons dancing in the workshop; the factory was packed with people. Citizens from Elbasan and nearby rural areas rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. When they saw the moving scene of steel rolling before their eyes, tears of excitement welled up in their eyes, and some couldn't help but walk forward to hug and kiss the Chinese experts tightly.

During the construction of the steel mill, the Chinese experts demonstrated a lofty spirit of selflessness and a high sense of responsibility, working diligently to serve the Albanian people. According to the work schedule, they could go off duty at around 3:00 or 4:00 PM in the afternoon, but they thought of contributing more to the steel mill. They often worked with Albanian workers until 8:00 or 9:00 PM in the evening; when they took off their safety helmets, the sky was already full of stars. On Sundays, they went to work as usual. Some experts were still working on the construction site on the eve of the Spring Festival. These experts maintained a simple and frugal lifestyle. They wore work boots and overalls, not only providing technical guidance but also personally operating the machinery. They also mingled with the Albanian people everywhere. In May of last year, when the workers and citizens of the Elbasan district went to reclaim wasteland, they also actively participated in voluntary labor. In June, they spent three Sundays with the steel mill workers climbing mountains and crossing rivers to harvest wheat. During the labor, they were not afraid of hardship or fatigue, their hands blistered with blood, and sweat poured down, but they did not stop for a moment. The local farmers, seeing this, said with emotion: "Experts armed with Mao Zedong Thought are different from experts of any other country. They not only have high technical skills but also have high political awareness."

The Chinese experts have such qualities because they regard Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive. In the early stages of the "trial rolling," the quality of the finished products was sometimes unstable. Initially, it was not unusual to roll out some scrap steel, but the entire expert team held several meetings to conduct in-depth research. They felt that the equipment of the steel mill was somewhat different from that at home, and there were some objective difficulties, but they had to be responsible to the Albanian people and could not waste a single piece of steel. They repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" (i.e., "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?"), reading them over and over again, pondering one question after another. They seriously analyzed the situation, summarized the experience, and finally proposed more than ten plans to stabilize the quality. After comparison, they chose a plan that was both simple and practical. Practice has shown that this plan was very effective, making the quality meet the high standard requirements. It was precisely because the Chinese experts used Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest revolutionary weapon, that they successfully completed the task of helping to build the steel rolling mill.

On the day of the steel mill's opening ceremony, portraits of Comrade Hoxha and Chairman Mao were hung at the factory gate, and people's faces were filled with smiles of happiness. Mechanic Filit said, "We have finally found you, our true friends from China, after more than ten years of waiting."

    全心全意为阿尔巴尼亚兄弟服务
    ——毛泽东思想武装的中国专家帮助阿尔巴尼亚建设轧钢厂
    一九六四年春天，正值百花盛开的季节，一批中国专家带着鲜红的《毛泽东选集》，来到了屹立在亚得里亚海滨的英雄之国——阿尔巴尼亚。他们是根据中阿经济技术合作协定来阿尔巴尼亚帮助建设爱尔巴桑轧钢厂的。
    在中国专家帮助下，经过两年紧张的建设，去年三月二十三日晚上，爱尔巴桑轧钢厂试轧成功了。这是个不平常的时刻啊！从此，阿尔巴尼亚就有自己生产的钢材了。那天晚上，轧出的一根根钢材象一条条飞舞的火龙，在车间里游动；厂房里已人山人海，爱尔巴桑一些市民和郊区农民闻讯赶来了。当他们看到眼前轧钢的动人情景时，两眼闪出了激动的泪花，有的情不自禁地走上前去和中国专家紧紧拥抱、亲吻。
    中国专家在帮助建设钢厂期间，表现了崇高的忘我精神和高度的责任感，勤勤恳恳为阿尔巴尼亚人民服务。按工作制度，下午三四点钟就可下班，但中国专家想到的是多给钢厂贡献一点力量，常常和阿尔巴尼亚工人一起工作到晚上八九点钟；摘下安全帽，已是满天星斗了。星期日，也和往常一样去上班。有的专家在春节前夜还在工地上劳作。这些专家们，生活上始终保持艰苦朴素的作风。他们穿着大头鞋和工作服，既做技术指导，又亲自动手操作。他们还处处和阿尔巴尼亚人民打成一片。去年五月，爱尔巴桑区职工和市民去开垦荒地，他们也积极参加了义务劳动。六月，他们有三个星期日与钢厂职工翻山越岭去收割小麦。劳动中，他们不怕苦不怕累，满手磨出水泡血泡，汗如雨下，也不住手歇一会儿。当地农民看了感动地说：“毛泽东思想武装起来的专家不同于其他任何国家的专家，他们不光有高度的技术，同时有高度的政治觉悟。”
    中国专家所以有这种品质，是因为他们把毛泽东思想作为最高指示。在“试轧”初期，成品质量有时不够稳定，本来，初期轧根把废钢也是不奇怪的，可是专家组全体同志多次开会，进行了细致深入的研究。他们觉得钢厂设备和国内是有些不同，客观上是有一些困难，但必须对阿尔巴尼亚人民负责，不能浪费一根钢材。他们反复地学习“老三篇”，读了一遍又一遍，思索着一个又一个问题。大家认真地分析了情况，总结了经验，最后提出了十几个稳定质量的方案。经过比较，选择了一个既简易又实用的方案。实践表明这个方案效果很好，使质量都达到了高标准要求。正因为中国专家运用了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的革命武器，胜利地完成了帮助建设轧钢厂的任务。
    钢厂剪彩投产那天，工厂大门口挂着霍查同志和毛主席的像，人们脸上露出了幸福的微笑。机械工菲利特说：“我们十几年找到了你们中国这个真正的朋友。”
