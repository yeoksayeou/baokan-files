	Shanghai Food Company System Revolutionary Rebels Resolutely Resist Reactionary Trends and Seriously Implement Chairman Mao's Policies on Cadres

	Unit revolutionary cadres, together seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road; after seizing power, work with revolutionary cadres and the masses to promote revolution and production, and jointly undertake leadership responsibilities. For some cadres who have made mistakes and have many concerns, do thorough ideological work and, in actual struggles, examine them. Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary cadres have gained a deeper understanding of each other through fighting side by side, and some cadres have been absorbed into the revolutionary organizations of the revolutionary rebels.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 19th: In the struggle to seize power from the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the revolutionary rebels of the Shanghai Food Company System have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and correctly handled cadre issues. They have united with genuine revolutionary cadres to jointly seize power and have also conducted political and ideological work among the revolutionary masses, resisting the reactionary trend of "attacking all those in power, seizing all cadres, opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything" without distinguishing right from wrong.

	After more than half a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially after the recent period of exposing and criticizing the capitalist reactionary line, the cadre front in the Shanghai Food Company and its affiliated units has gradually become clear. In the intense struggle, cadres have shown four types of situations: One type is firmly standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, supporting the revolutionary rebels in their struggle against the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line. They have always fought side by side with the revolutionary rebels, with a clear stance. Another type is inclined towards the revolutionary rebels but has many concerns and an unclear attitude. Another type is cadres with general mistakes and shortcomings, carrying heavy burdens. Another type is the handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line. Based on this reality, the revolutionary rebels of the fourteen grassroots units under the Food Company, in the struggle to seize power, have united with revolutionary cadres to jointly seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road. After seizing power, they have worked with revolutionary cadres and the masses to promote revolution and production, jointly undertaking leadership responsibilities. At the same time, they have done thorough ideological work for some cadres who have made mistakes and have many concerns. In the struggle to deeply expose and criticize those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line, they have examined whether these cadres are sincerely willing to correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary cadres have gained a deeper understanding of each other through fighting side by side, and some cadres have been absorbed into the revolutionary organizations of the revolutionary rebels.

	However, the revolutionary rebels have also faced struggles in handling cadre issues. At the beginning, when the revolutionary rebels enthusiastically supported the proletarian leaders in their struggle against the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the "Red Guards" organization, incited by a handful of leaders, slandered the revolutionary rebels as "protecting the emperor." When revolutionary leading cadres supported the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels, the "Red Guards" attacked the revolutionary cadres. However, the more the revolutionary rebels were attacked and opposed by the "Red Guards," the more they felt they were right, and the more firmly they supported the revolutionary cadres. But under the impact of the reactionary trend from society that did not distinguish right from wrong, "attacking all those in power, seizing all cadres, opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything," the revolutionary rebels were also influenced to some extent. For a period, some units under this company did not dare to approach revolutionary cadres and did not dare to boldly let revolutionary cadres participate in the struggle to seize power. Just at this time, the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao came from Beijing. The third issue of "Red Flag" magazine published the editorial "On the Struggle to Seize Power by the Revolutionary Rebels of the Proletariat." Several responsible persons of the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station of the Food Company carefully studied this guiding document for the struggle to seize power by the revolutionary rebels, further recognizing the important role of revolutionary cadres in the struggle to seize power. They also deeply realized that they must use the class analysis viewpoint to specifically analyze and distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution. If they are proletarian leaders, firmly support them; if they are bourgeois leaders, firmly overthrow them.

	Some people said, "You rebels have a background." The revolutionary rebels said, any organization has a background, either a bourgeois background or a proletarian background. The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat must support the proletarian leaders. Recently, the liaison station specially held a core meeting of the revolutionary rebels to exchange views on the current situation of the struggle to seize power and the correct understanding of cadre issues in the struggle to seize power. At the meeting, three revolutionary cadres, including the former Party Secretary of the company, once again expressed to the revolutionary rebels: firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels and firmly act according to Chairman Mao's instruction, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." The revolutionary rebels of the Food Company and its affiliated units welcomed and firmly supported the determination of the revolutionary cadres.

    上海食品公司系统无产阶级革命派坚决抵制反动思潮
    认真贯彻毛主席的干部政策
    团结革命干部，一起向走资本主义道路当权派夺权；夺权后同革命干部和群众一起抓革命、促生产，共同担负领导工作。对一些犯有错误、顾虑较多的干部，认真做好思想工作，并在实际斗争中，对他们进行考察。无产阶级革命派的战士和革命干部在并肩战斗中，有了进一步的了解，有些干部已被吸收参加了无产阶级革命派的革命组织。
    据新华社上海十九日电　上海市食品公司系统的无产阶级革命派在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的斗争中，认真贯彻毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部问题。他们同真正的革命干部团结起来联合夺权，并且向革命群众进行政治思想工作，抵制了不分青红皂白，“见当权派就打，见干部就揪”、“反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切”的反动思潮。
    上海市食品公司及所属各单位经过半年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，特别是经过最近时期揭发、批判资产阶级反动路线，干部阵线逐步明朗化。在激烈的斗争中，干部中出现了四种状况：一种是坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，支持无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子展开斗争，他们始终和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，立场鲜明。一种是倾向于无产阶级革命派，但顾虑较多，态度不明朗。一种是有一般错误、缺点的干部，有较重的包袱。一种是一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。从这个实际出发，食品公司所属十四个基层单位的无产阶级革命派，在夺权斗争中团结革命干部，一起向走资本主义道路当权派夺权，在夺权以后同革命干部和群众一起抓革命、促生产，共同担负领导工作。同时，他们对一些犯有错误、顾虑较多的干部，认真做好思想工作，在深入揭发、批判走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的斗争中，考察这些干部是否真心实意地愿意改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线一边来。无产阶级革命派的战士和革命干部在并肩战斗中，有了进一步的了解，有些干部已被吸收参加了无产阶级革命派的革命组织。
    但是，无产阶级革命派在对待干部问题上，也不是没有斗争的。开始，当无产阶级革命派的战士们热情支持无产阶级当权派，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开斗争的时候，保皇组织工人“赤卫队”在一小撮头头的挑动下，污蔑无产阶级革命派是“保皇”。当革命领导干部支持了无产阶级革命派的革命行动时，工人“赤卫队”就围攻革命干部。然而，越是被工人“赤卫队”攻击、反对，无产阶级革命派的战士们越感到自己做对了，就越坚定地支持革命干部。可是，在来自社会上的不分青红皂白，“见当权派就打，见干部就揪”、“反对一切，排斥一切，打倒一切”的反动思潮冲击下，无产阶级革命派内部也受到了一定的影响。有一个时期，这个公司所属的有些单位的无产阶级革命组织不敢同革命干部接近，不敢大胆地让革命干部参加夺权斗争。正在这个时候，北京传来了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，《红旗》杂志第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》发表了。食品公司革命造反派联络站的几个负责人，认真地学习了这个指导无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的纲领性文件，进一步认识到革命干部在夺权斗争中的重要作用。他们也进一步地深刻认识到，对当权派一定要用阶级分析的观点，具体分析，区别对待，划清两类不同性质的矛盾，划清革命与反革命的界限。是无产阶级当权派，就坚决支持；是资产阶级当权派，就坚决打倒。
    有人说：“你们造反派有背景。”革命派说，任何组织都是有背景的，不是资产阶级的背景，就是无产阶级的背景。无产阶级革命派就是要支持无产阶级当权派。最近，联络站专门举行了无产阶级革命派骨干会议，交流对当前夺权斗争形势的认识，以及在夺权斗争中对干部问题的正确认识。会上，原公司党委书记等三个革命干部，再一次向无产阶级革命派表示：坚决站在革命派一边，坚决按照毛主席的“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的指示办事。食品公司及所属各单位无产阶级革命派的战士对革命干部这种决心，表示最热烈的欢迎和坚决的支持。
