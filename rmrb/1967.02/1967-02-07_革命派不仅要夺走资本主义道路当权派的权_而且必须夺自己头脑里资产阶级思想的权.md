The *Red Flag* magazine reprinted the article "Overthrow the 'Private' Character and Achieve Great Unity Among Revolutionary Rebels" and added an editorial note. The revolutionary faction must not only seize power from the capitalist roaders in power but also must overthrow the bourgeois ideology in their minds. To overthrow the "private" character, one must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, carry out a revolution in the depths of one's soul, and unite with workers and peasants.

The following is the full text of the editorial note added by the *Red Flag* magazine when it reprinted the article "Overthrow the 'Private' Character and Achieve Great Unity Among Revolutionary Rebels," which was published on the third page of the first edition of January 31, 1967:

*Red Flag* magazine editorial note: "Overthrow the 'Private' Character and Achieve Great Unity Among Revolutionary Rebels" is a good article that actively applies Chairman Mao's teachings in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We recommend it to revolutionary rebels nationwide. This article raises an important issue of universal significance in the current struggle for power: the need to "overthrow the 'private' character."

This article is good because it recognizes that we are currently engaged in two struggles for power. The article points out: the revolutionary rebels must not only seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party but also must seize power from the bourgeois ideology in our minds.

Without seizing power from the "private" character in our minds and overthrowing the "private" character in our minds, we cannot seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Only by seizing power from the bourgeois ideology in our minds and allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the ideological battlefield can we form a powerful and united revolutionary force. Otherwise, even if we seize power from the capitalist roaders, we cannot consolidate it. Spiritual things must be transformed into material things. If we seize power with the "private" character in our minds, even if we seize it, this power will still degenerate into a bourgeois power.

In the current struggle for power, various erroneous tendencies such as localism, factionalism, dispersionism, non-organizational views, ultra-democracy, liberalism, and subjectivism have emerged in some revolutionary rebel forces. The root cause of these tendencies is the "private" character. The slogan "Overthrow the 'Private' Character" is profound and timely, hitting the root of the problem.

To overthrow the "private" character, one must seriously study Chairman Mao's works. Currently, studying the brilliant works such as "Rectification of Errors in the Party," "Against Liberalism," and the "Three Articles" has great practical significance and should be thoroughly studied. It is completely wrong to relax study under the pretext of intense struggle, and this should be immediately corrected.

To overthrow the "private" character, one must carry out a revolution in the depths of one's soul and engage in active ideological struggle and serious criticism and self-criticism.

To overthrow the "private" character, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite with workers and peasants, transform one's worldview, and establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the workers and peasants.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, but at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be successful." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution requires us to revolutionize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, seize their power, and fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to ruin; but at the same time, it requires us to revolutionize the bourgeois ideology in our minds. While we transform the objective world, we must also transform the subjective world.

The transformation of the subjective world of the revolutionary forces has decisive significance under certain conditions. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese imperialists said: "We are not afraid of the Eighth Route Army's large-scale military exercises, but we are afraid of the Eighth Route Army's large-scale rectification." Similarly, today, for the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, what they fear the most is our ideological revolutionization, the arming of our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, the overthrow of the "private" character, and the achievement and consolidation of the great unity of the revolutionary faction on the principle basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Victory belongs to the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

    革命派不仅要夺走资本主义道路当权派的权
    而且必须夺自己头脑里资产阶级思想的权
    打倒“私”字，必须认真学习毛主席著作，在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，实行知识分子同工农相结合
    本报讯　《红旗》杂志一九六七年第三期，在转载本报一月三十一日第三版发表的《打倒“私”字，实行革命造反派大联合》一文时，加了编者按语，全文如下：
    《红旗》杂志编者按：《打倒“私”字，实行革命造反派大联合》，是一篇在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作的好文章。我们在这里向全国革命造反派的同志们推荐。这篇文章提出了一个带普遍意义的重要问题，就是在当前的夺权斗争中，必须
  “打倒‘私’字”。
    这篇文章之所以好，就是因为它看到了我们正在进行着两种“夺权”的斗争。文章指出：革命造反派不仅要夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，而且必须夺我们头脑里的资产阶级思想的权。
    不夺我们头脑里“私”字的权，不打倒头脑里的“私”字，就不能夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权。只有夺了我们头脑中的资产阶级思想的权，让毛泽东思想占领思想阵地，才能形成浩浩荡荡的步伐一致的坚强革命队伍。否则，即使夺了走资本主义道路当权派的权，也不能巩固。精神的东西要转化为物质的东西，脑子里带着“私”字去夺权，即使夺了，这个权也还会蜕化为资产阶级的政权。
    在当前夺权的斗争中，一些革命造反派队伍中暴露出来的本位主义、小团体主义、分散主义、非组织观点、极端民主化、自由主义、主观主义等等错误倾向，有一个总根子，这就是“私”字。“打倒‘私’字”这个口号，提得深刻，提得及时，说到了问题的根本。
    打倒“私”字，必须认真学习毛主席著作。在当前，学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、“老三篇”等光辉著作，具有重大的现实意义，应该切实学好。借口斗争紧张而放松学习，是完全错误的，应该立即纠正。
    打倒“私”字，必须在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，要开展积极的思想斗争，开展严肃的批评和自我批评。
    打倒“私”字，要遵照毛主席的教导，实行知识分子同工农相结合，改造自己的世界观，树立全心全意为工农服务的思想。
    林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”无产阶级文化大革命，要革党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的命，夺他们的权，把他们斗倒、斗臭、斗垮；但同时，又要革我们自己头脑中的资产阶级思想的命。我们在改造客观世界的同时，必须改造主观世界。
    革命队伍的主观世界的改造，在一定的条件下，具有决定的意义。抗日战争时期，日本帝国主义者说：“不怕八路军大练兵，就怕八路军大整风。”同样，在今天，对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派来说，他们最害怕的，就是我们的思想革命化，就是用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，打倒“私”字，实现和巩固革命派在毛泽东思想的原则基础上的大联合。
    胜利属于用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民！
