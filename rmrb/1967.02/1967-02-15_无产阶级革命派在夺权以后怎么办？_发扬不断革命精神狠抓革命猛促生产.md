The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, after seizing power, how should they hold power firmly and use it well, and achieve double victories in revolution and production? The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Camera Factory II have set a good example in this regard.

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels of this factory, following the teachings of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, "grasp revolution, promote production," carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, insisted on putting proletarian politics in command, fully relied on the masses, mobilized the masses extensively, grasped revolution firmly, and promoted production vigorously, creating the miracle of completing 90.8% of the monthly production plan in just 16 days.

The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Camera Factory II seized power from the capitalists within the factory on January 14th of this year. Before this, due to the evil winds of economism blown by a handful of capitalist-roaders in the former Shanghai Municipal Committee, a handful of capitalist-roaders in Shanghai Camera Factory II also used vicious methods to incite workers to demand economic benefits, causing a large number of workers to leave their posts, leading the entire factory's production to a state of paralysis. From January 1st to 14th, only 9.2% of the monthly production plan was completed, and not a single camera was shipped out of the factory.

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels faced such a mess: machines were idle, parts were disconnected, assembly was halted, inventory was depleted... What to do? Should they focus solely on production, or grasp revolution and promote production? After studying Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Camera Factory II realized: this is a struggle between two lines and two thoughts. They must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions and take the path of "grasp revolution, promote production," and never take the path of focusing solely on production and neglecting revolution. They believed that only by firmly grasping revolution could the broad masses educate themselves through struggle, turning the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebels into a powerful force to promote production; at the same time, only by doing a good job in production could the proletarian revolution stand unshakable.

After seizing power, the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai Camera Factory II, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production," focused on two aspects of work: First, they continued to firmly expose and criticize the capitalist reactionary line and a handful of capitalist-roaders. After the power seizure meeting, the revolutionary rebels immediately held a rally to grasp revolution and promote production, launching a fierce attack on the capitalist reactionary line. At the meeting, workers used a large amount of facts to expose and accuse the diehards who stubbornly insisted on the capitalist reactionary line of their heinous crimes of sabotaging production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers became more indignant the more they exposed, their revolutionary spirit soared higher, their hatred for the class enemies deepened, and their enthusiasm for production grew stronger. They all expressed their determination to fight for the glory of the great leader Chairman Mao, for the glory of the motherland, and for the pride of the proletarian revolutionary rebels.

Second, after seizing power, according to the Marxist principle of smashing the old state machine, they used thorough revolutionary spirit to smash old rules and systems, rely on the masses, and created a new revolutionary order. On the day of seizing power, the revolutionary rebels of this factory announced the abolition of the position of workshop director and reappointed production group leaders. Previously, to transfer a worker for production needs, one had to go through multiple levels of approval. Now, after breaking through this old framework, workers were transferred to where they were needed in production, and the type of workers needed for production were dispatched accordingly, everything was done for the overall situation and revolutionary interests. In addition, after seizing power, the workers' revolutionary rebels of this factory did their best to reduce or even not reduce their production time.

In the leadership of production and revolution, the revolutionary rebels of this factory insisted on implementing Chairman Mao's repeated emphasis on believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' spirit of initiative. Where there were problems in production, they went there, discussed with the masses, instead of issuing orders from above. For example, after finding that the main contradiction in production was in the large metalworking group of Workshop 1, they held a workshop mass meeting to inform everyone of the production problems. At that time, the workers of the small metalworking group and the mold-making groups 1 and 2 proactively requested to go and support. The broad revolutionary workers felt that they were truly masters of the house, their morale was high, and the production index rose sharply. By late January, production efficiency had nearly doubled. After solving the problem of the large metalworking group, parts flowed continuously to the assembly workshop, thus the contradiction in the assembly workshop became prominent. The workers' revolutionary rebels discussed with the worker masses the current situation of the struggle, further mobilized everyone politically and ideologically, and required the rebel team members to take the lead. The entire workshop immediately boiled over, and the daily output increased by three to four times. In just five days, 50% of the monthly production plan was completed. On the afternoon of January 30th, all revolutionary workers in the factory successfully completed the production plan for January. Such high revolutionary enthusiasm and such high speed are unprecedented in the history of this factory.

After seizing power, the position of the revolutionary rebels in the factory changed, but they did not become arrogant and complacent because of the achievements they had made in the struggle. They often used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out rectification. Recently, they seriously studied the "Three Articles," thoroughly smashed the "self" in their minds. They also organized all rebel team members to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" and mobilized the masses to give suggestions to the responsible persons of the rebel team. After the newspaper reprinted Chairman Mao's another brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," the rebel team immediately organized a study session. They deeply felt that to seize the power of the capitalist-roaders within the party, one must first seize the power of the "self" in one's mind. Only by continuously smashing the "self" and establishing the public can the unity and combat effectiveness within the revolutionary rebel ranks be strengthened. This is the key to mobilizing the masses extensively, uniting the masses to "grasp revolution, promote production," and carry the revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary rebel workers of Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, after the victory of seizing power, united all revolutionary workers in the factory and firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They firmly guarded their production posts and completed the production tasks for January this year. This is the joy of workers celebrating new victories.

    无产阶级革命派在夺权以后怎么办？
    发扬不断革命精神狠抓革命猛促生产
    上海照相机二厂革命造反派坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，创造了十六天完成全月生产计划百分之九十点八的奇迹
    据新华社上海十四日电　无产阶级革命派在夺权以后，如何掌好权，用好权，夺取革命和生产的双胜利？上海照相机二厂在这方面为革命造反派树立了好榜样。
    这个厂的革命造反派在夺权以后，遵照我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，发扬不断革命精神，坚持突出无产阶级政治，充分依靠群众，放手发动群众，狠抓革命，猛促生产，创造了以十六天时间完成全月生产计划百分之九十点八的奇迹。
    上海照相机二厂的革命造反派是今年一月十四日从厂内走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权的。在这以前，由于旧上海市委一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮起了经济主义妖风，上海照相机二厂一小撮走资本主义道路当权派也使用了恶毒的手法，挑动工人闹经济福利，唆使大批工人离开生产岗位，使整个工厂的生产陷于瘫痪状态。从一月一日到十四日只完成全月生产计划的百分之九点二，一架照相机也没有出厂。
    夺权以后，摆在革命造反派面前的是这样一副烂摊子：机器无人操作，零部件脱节，装配停工，库存没有了……怎么办？是单纯抓生产，还是抓革命，促生产？上海照相机二厂的革命造反派学习毛主席的有关指示后，认识到：这是两条道路、两种思想的斗争。只有坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，走“抓革命，促生产”的道路，决不能走单纯抓生产丢革命的道路。他们认为，只有紧紧抓住革命，才能使广大群众在斗争中自己教育自己，把无产阶级的革命造反精神变成促进生产的强大动力；同时也只有把生产搞好，才能使无产阶级革命立于不败之地。
    上海照相机二厂革命造反派在夺权以后，按照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，着重做了两方面的工作：第一，继续狠抓揭发批判资产阶级反动路线和一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在夺权大会以后，革命造反派就紧接着召开了抓革命，促生产，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火的誓师大会。会上，工人们用大量事实，揭发、控诉顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙破坏生产、破坏文化大革命的滔天罪行。革命造反派和革命工人越揭发越气愤，革命斗志也越高，对阶级敌人的仇恨越深，生产干劲也越大，他们纷纷表示，一定要为伟大领袖毛主席争光，为祖国争光，为工人革命造反派争气。
    第二，夺权以后，按照马克思主义的打碎旧的国家机器的原则，用彻底的革命精神，砸烂旧规章、制度，依靠群众，创造了革命的新秩序。夺权的当天，这个厂的革命造反派就宣布取消车间主任这一级，并且重新选派了生产组长。以前，生产上需要调动一个工人，得经过层层关口。现在这一套旧框框打破以后，生产上那里需要，就把工人调到那里去，生产上需要什么样的工人，就派什么样的工人去，一切从全局出发，从革命利益出发。此外，这个厂的工人革命造反派夺权以后，尽量做到少脱产，甚至不脱产。
    在生产和革命的领导工作中，这个厂的革命造反派坚持贯彻了毛主席一再指出的相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神的教导。生产上那里有问题，他们就到那里去，同群众一起商量，而不是坐在上面发号施令。比如，当他们找到一车间大金工小组是生产环节上的主要矛盾以后，便召开车间群众大会，把生产上的问题告诉大家。当时，小金工组和制模一、二组的工人主动要求前去支援。广大革命工人感到自己真正当家作主了，劲头很高，生产指标直线上升，到了一月下旬，生产效率提高了将近两倍。大金工小组的问题解决以后，零部件源源涌到装配车间，这样，装配车间的矛盾就突出了，工人革命造反派就同工人群众一起学习毛主席语录：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”同大家谈当前斗争的形势，从政治思想上进一步发动大家，并且要求造反队员起带头作用。整个车间立刻沸腾起来，日产量增长了三、四倍。短短五天时间，完成了全月生产计划的百分之五十。一月三十日下午，全厂革命工人胜利完成了一月份生产计划。这样高涨的革命热情，这样的高速度，是这个厂建厂以来所没有过的。
    夺权以后，革命造反派在工厂的地位变化了，但他们并没有因为在斗争中所取得的成绩而骄傲自满，他们经常以毛泽东思想为武器开展整风。最近，他们认真地学习了“老三篇”，大破自己头脑里的“私”字。他们还组织全体造反队员学习毛主席的光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，发动群众给造反队的负责人提意见。报上重新发表了毛主席的又一光辉著作《将革命进行到底》后，造反队又及时地组织了学习。他们深深体会到，要夺党内走资本主义道路当权派的权，首先要夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，只有不断地破私立公，才能加强革命造反派内部的团结和战斗力，这是放手发动群众，团结群众“抓革命，促生产”，将革命进行到底的关键。（附图片）
