	Japanese women in Yamaguchi Prefecture established a revolutionary women's organization and announced a break with the women's association controlled by revisionists, stressing the need to strengthen unity with Chinese women and advance with confidence.

	TOKYO, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- Women revolutionaries in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, held a meeting in Yamaguchi City on Feb. 5, announcing their severance of ties with the New Japan Women's Association controlled by revisionists and the establishment of the "Yamaguchi Prefecture Democratic Women's League."

	More than 100 women representatives attended the meeting. After heated discussions, the meeting adopted the charter and declaration of the "Yamaguchi Prefecture Democratic Women's League."

	The charter states: "We, as a force striving for Japan's independence, democracy, and peace, will fight for the genuine liberation of women."

	The declaration states: "Currently, revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces are engaged in fierce struggles worldwide. We must closely unite with revolutionary people around the globe and resolutely fight against American imperialism, which obstructs the liberation of Japanese women, as well as the old and new reactionary forces that follow it."

	The declaration further states: "We will strengthen our unity with Chinese women, who are advancing under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and move forward with confidence."

	Famous figure in the Japanese women's movement, Chiyo Nakajima, traveled from Tokyo to attend the meeting. Nakajima congratulated the women of Yamaguchi Prefecture for being the first in Japan to establish a new women's liberation organization. She said that the New Japan Women's Association, controlled by revisionists, is facing a collapse in various parts of Japan. She exposed the plot of Japanese revisionists to align with the Soviet Union and oppose China, and pointed out that without opposing modern revisionism, there can be no liberation for women or national independence.

	The conference elected 12 members to the county committee.
