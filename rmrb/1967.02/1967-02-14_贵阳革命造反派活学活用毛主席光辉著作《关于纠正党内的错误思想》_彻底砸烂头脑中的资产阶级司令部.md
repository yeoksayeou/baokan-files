The revolutionary rebels of Guiyang are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters in their minds. They are determined to build the revolutionary rebel organizations into extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready revolutionary forces. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they will strengthen their fighting spirit, invigorate their morale, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to a report from the *New Guizhou Daily*, after Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" was reprinted in the newspapers, the proletarian revolutionary rebels in the Guiyang region enthusiastically hailed this brilliant work as a beacon for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entering a new historical stage. It is a guideline and program for the proletarian revolutionaries to achieve great unity. They linked the current struggle with their actual conditions, studied this brilliant work deeply with questions in mind, and decided to build the revolutionary rebel forces into extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready revolutionary forces through study, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary rebels who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought have launched a study campaign. The Mao Zedong Thought Guiyang Combat Team, in addition to having its headquarters members persist in collective study every morning, also organized the members of various teams to study. Everyone, in the spirit of rectification, linked their thoughts and work with actual conditions, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. Some members of the headquarters voluntarily examined their shortcomings and mistakes of acting as "little commanders," handling issues on their own, and lacking democratic spirit. Some examined their extreme democratic tendencies, lack of organizational perspective, and the habit of only doing work that suited their tastes and refusing to do work that did not. Some also examined tendencies such as factionalism and sectarianism. Everyone believed that the root of these erroneous ideas came from petty-bourgeois and bourgeois thoughts, and if not eliminated, they would be extremely harmful to the organization. These thoughts all centered on the character "self." Through criticism and self-criticism, everyone broke down the "self" and established the "public," carrying out a revolution in their souls. The Guiyang Red Star Tractor Factory Combat Team, after studying this brilliant work, had its members' spirits invigorated and fighting spirit soaring. They all spoke out, saying that Chairman Mao had pointed out the direction for us to advance. This brilliant work exposed all the dirty things in our minds. We must thoroughly eliminate the erroneous tendencies of ultra-democracy, factionalism, and subjectivism, and remove the "self" from our minds to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. The revolutionary rebels of the Guiyang Cotton Textile Mill, who had seized the leadership from the capitalist-roaders, held a mobilization meeting on February 3 to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" and the "Three Articles." At the meeting, the worker comrades of the revolutionary rebels all expressed their determination to study "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" and the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles, and to fiercely combat the "self" in their minds. They said that in the new stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, where the struggle for power is intensifying, it is urgent to study "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" and the "Three Articles." Without study, one cannot keep up with the development of the revolutionary situation. After the mobilization meeting, everyone's study enthusiasm soared, and the effects were remarkable.

The Little Red Guards, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's brilliant work. The revolutionary warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards September 15th Combat Team of Guizhou Institute of Technology deeply felt, after studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant work, that ultra-democracy, parochialism, and other erroneous tendencies were corrosive and centrifugal to the great unity of the revolutionary rebels, causing great harm, and enhanced proletarian organizational discipline. The revolutionary young warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought September 5th Red Combat Team of the Provincial Commercial School, after the initial victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the beginning of the collapse of the bourgeois reactionary line, once relaxed their study of Chairman Mao's works, and arrogance, ultra-democracy, liberalism, individualism, and other non-proletarian thoughts emerged. Their combat effectiveness also weakened. Just at this critical moment, the young warriors heard and saw Chairman Mao's article "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" on the radio and in the newspapers. The more they listened, the more they felt that every word of Chairman Mao's was spoken from their hearts. The erroneous thoughts pointed out by Chairman Mao were all present in their team. Some students said: The situation has changed, and those who consider themselves "old cannons" and do not strive for progress will inevitably fall behind. The young warriors formulated a study system and persisted in studying every day. Currently, this revolutionary force is full of vitality and is fiercely counterattacking the new counteroffensive of the bourgeois reactionary line!

Many revolutionary rebel organizations affiliated with the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station of the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee, after seizing power from the capitalist-roaders in their units, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" and the "Three Articles" in response to some current problems. While transforming the objective world, they also transformed their subjective world. Many comrades believed that some members of the revolutionary organizations were very resolute in their struggle against the capitalist-roaders, but after seizing power, many problems arose. These problems were prominently manifested in: a few people vying for power and benefits, some revolutionary organizations vying for the position of convener or chairman, etc. These were all parochialism, factionalism, separatism, individualism, and factionalism. Many revolutionary rebel organizations, with these problems in mind, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works and deeply felt that this article written by Chairman Mao more than thirty years ago was as if it were speaking to our current situation. Many comrades believed that the problems that have emerged are essentially a struggle between "public" and "self," a reflection of the two lines within the revolutionary ranks. If these problems are not solved, not only will individualism and separatism appear, but personal ambitions may also arise. If one seizes power with a "self" in one's mind, even if one seizes it, this power will degenerate into a bourgeois power. Many revolutionary rebel organizations believed that at this critical moment of seizing power, Chairman Mao's brilliant works have once again illuminated our path forward. Revolutionary rebels must not only seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party but must also seize the power of bourgeois ideology in their minds. Only by seizing the power of bourgeois ideology in one's mind and allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the ideological battlefield can a vast and united strong revolutionary force be formed to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The members of the headquarters of the Guarding Mao Zedong Thought Combat Team of the Guiyang Municipal Organs conducted rectification and carried out criticism and self-criticism in conjunction with the study of this brilliant work, achieving significant results and greatly enhancing unity. Now, many grassroots organizations of this combat team have also launched a study campaign.

The revolutionary rebels of the Dongfanghong Commune of the Dongfanghong Troupe of Guizhou Province recently linked the actual struggle, repeatedly studied "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts," and used this brilliant work as a sharp weapon to conduct rectification. They said, Chairman Mao's brilliant work written 37 years ago most comprehensively and profoundly expounded on the various erroneous tendencies that revolutionary organizations should pay attention to in the struggle and the methods of rectification. We should study this brilliant work as we study the "Three Articles" and take it as our guiding principle. Some members of the commune had previously held ultra-democratic tendencies. After studying this brilliant work in conjunction with actual conditions, they received deep education and all expressed: We are revolutionaries and what we want is great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, not bourgeois democracy. We must break down the "self" and establish the "public" everywhere, and build our commune into an extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready revolutionary organization.

Currently, the revolutionary rebels in the Guiyang region are, according to the notice of the Guizhou Proletarian Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, pushing the study of "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts" and the "Three Articles" and other works of Chairman Mao to a new high. They will truly achieve two revolutions with Mao Zedong Thought: the revolution to transform the objective world and the revolution to transform the subjective world; seize two powers: seize the power from the capitalist-roaders and seize the power of the "self" in one's mind. They will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    贵阳革命造反派活学活用毛主席光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》
    彻底砸烂头脑中的资产阶级司令部
    他们决心把革命造反派组织建成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，增强斗志，振奋精神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    本报讯　据《新贵州报》报道：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》在报纸上重新刊登后，贵阳地区的无产阶级革命造反派，热烈欢呼这篇光辉著作是无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新的历史阶段的指路明灯，是无产阶级革命派实行大联合的指针和纲领。他们联系当前斗争实际，带着问题，深入学习这篇光辉著作，决心通过学习，把革命造反派的队伍建成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    无限忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的革命造反派工人，掀起了学习热潮。毛泽东思想贵阳战斗团除总部成员坚持每天上午集体学习外，还组织各队同志学习。大家在学习中，用整风精神，联系思想实际和工作实际，开展批评和自我批评。总部有的同志主动检查了自己以“小首长”自居，处理问题自作主张，缺乏民主作风的缺点错误。有的同志检查了有极端民主化的思想倾向，缺乏组织观点，适合自己胃口的工作就作，不适合自己胃口的工作就不愿作的缺点错误。有的同志还检查了山头主义、宗派主义等等思想倾向。大家认为，这些错误东西的根源来自小资产阶级思想和资产阶级思想，如不肃清，对组织的危害极大。而这些思想集中到一点就是一个“私”字。大家经过批评和自我批评，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处闹了一次革命。这个战斗团所属贵州红星拖拉机厂战斗队学习了这篇光辉著作之后，队员们精神振奋，斗志昂扬，纷纷发言说，毛主席他老人家给我们指出了前进的方向，这篇光辉著作把我们思想上的一切肮脏东西通通照了出来。我们只有把极端民主化、小团体主义、主观主义的错误思想倾向彻底打掉，把脑子里的“私”字铲除掉，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。已经从走资本主义道路当权派手里夺得了领导权的贵阳棉纺织厂的革命造反派，二月三日召开了认真活学活用毛主席的光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”的誓师大会。会上，革命造反派的工人同志纷纷表示，一定要把《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，狠斗脑子里的“私”字。他们说，在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的新阶段，迫切需要学好《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”，不学习，就跟不上革命形势发展的需要。誓师大会后，大家学习热情高涨，效果显著。
    毛主席的红小兵们，满怀革命激情活学活用毛主席的这篇光辉著作。贵州工学院毛泽东思想红卫兵九·一五战斗团的革命战士，活学活用毛主席的这篇光辉著作后，深深地体会到极端民主化、本位主义等等错误倾向，是革命造反派大联合的腐蚀剂和离心剂，危害极大，增强了无产阶级的组织性和纪律性。省商业学校毛泽东思想九·五红色战斗队的革命小将，在毛主席的革命路线初步取得胜利，资产阶级反动路线开始大崩溃以后，一度放松了毛主席著作的学习，骄傲自满、极端民主化、自由主义、个人主义等非无产阶级思想便冒头了，战斗力也减弱了。就在这关键时刻，小将们从广播中和报纸上听到和看到了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇文章。越听，越看，越觉得毛主席的一字一句都说在自己的心坎上，毛主席指出的那些错误思想都是队里存在的。有的同学说：形势已发生变化了，以“老炮轰派”自居，不求上进，必然要落后。小将们订出了学习制度，天天坚持学。目前这支革命队伍，又充满了活力，狠狠地反击了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    中共贵州省委机关革命造反联络站所属的许多革命造反派组织，在夺取本单位党内走资本主义道路当权派的权后，针对当前存在的一些问题，普遍学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”等光辉著作，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。不少同志认为，有些革命组织的同志在对走资本主义道路的当权派的斗争中很坚决，但夺权以后，许多问题就出来了。这些问题突出地表现在：有少数人争权夺利，一些革命组织争当召集人、争主席位置，等等。这些都是本位主义、小团体主义、分散主义、个人主义、山头主义。许多革命造反组织带着这些问题，学习了毛主席的光辉著作，深深感到毛主席在三十多年前写的这篇文章，就象对我们现在的情况说的一样。许多同志认为，当前出现的这些问题，实质是“公”与“私”的斗争，是两种思想在革命队伍内的反映，如果不解决这些问题，不仅会出现个人主义和分散主义，还可能出现个人野心家。脑子里带着“私”字去夺权，即使夺了，这个权也还会蜕化为资产阶级政权。许多革命造反组织在学习中认为，在革命造反派夺权的关键时刻，毛主席的光辉著作又照亮了我们前进的道路。革命造反派不仅要夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权，而且必须夺自己头脑里的资产阶级思想的权。只有夺了自己头脑中资产阶级思想的权，让毛泽东思想占领思想阵地，才能形成浩浩荡荡的步伐一致的坚强革命队伍，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。贵阳市市级机关捍卫毛泽东思想战斗团总部的成员，结合着学习这篇光辉著作，进行整风，展开批评和自我批评，收到很大效果，大大增进了团结。现在，这个战斗团的许多基层组织也掀起了学习热潮。
    贵州省东方红文工团东方红公社的革命造反派，最近联系斗争实际，反复学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，并以这篇光辉著作作为锐利武器进行整风。他们说，毛主席三十七年前写的这篇光辉著作，最全面最深刻地阐述了革命组织在斗争中值得注意的各种不良思想倾向和纠正的方法，我们要象学“老三篇”一样，把这篇光辉著作当作座右铭来学。公社有些成员过去存在着极端民主化的思想倾向，联系实际学了这篇光辉著作后，受到很深的教育，纷纷表示：我们是革命者，要的是无产阶级专政下的大民主，不要资产阶级的民主，要处处破“私”立“公”，把我们的公社建成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命组织。
    现在，贵阳地区革命造反派正在根据贵州无产阶级革命造反总指挥部的通知，把学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”等毛主席著作推向新的高潮，真正做到用毛泽东思想进行两个革命：改造客观世界的革命和改造主观世界的革命；夺两个权：夺走资本主义道路的当权派的权，夺自己头脑里的“私”字的权。一定要将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
