Milan, Feb. 6 (New China News Agency) — The secretary of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Becci, who recently visited China, said at a meeting that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a struggle to seize power aimed at defending the revolutionary regime and repelling the onslaught of revisionism and capitalism.

He said, "Chairman Mao's bold initiative to mobilize the masses and to let them handle major political issues directly is a great revolutionary act. It proves that only by believing in the masses and adhering to the policy of 'from the masses, to the masses' can we build socialism and prepare for the transition to communism."

Becci also pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will bring about a tremendous leap forward in China's socialist revolution and construction.

According to the New China News Agency, the fifth issue of the Italian magazine "Eastern Wind," recently published, praises in its preface the great theoretical and practical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China for the entire international working-class movement.

The preface points out that Chairman Mao's theories on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society are the guiding principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The preface says: "Seizing power is by no means the end of class struggle in the course of advancing toward communism. On the contrary, in the transitional period of socialism, the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat will never end once and for all, and there will always be the possibility of capitalist restoration."

The preface praises Mao Zedong Thought as "the most advanced development of revolutionary theory" and calls on the masses to "learn and apply the principles, methods, and basic directives in Mao Zedong's works in the course of struggle and in the process of transforming reality and their subjective world."

    意共（马列主义）领导人强调说
    中国文化大革命保卫了革命政权
    据新华社六日讯　米兰消息：不久前访问中国的意大利共产党（马克思—列宁主义）书记贝契在一次集会上说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是一次为了保卫革命政权，击退修正主义和资本主义进攻的夺权斗争。
    他说，毛主席“放手发动群众，把重大的政治问题直接交给群众去处理，这是一种大无畏的革命行动。这证明，只有相信群众，依靠从群众中来、到群众中去的政策，才能建设社会主义并为向共产主义过渡作准备”。
    贝契还指出，中国的文化大革命，将使中国的社会主义革命和建设实现巨大的跃进。
    据新华社五日讯　最近出版的意大利《东风》季刊第五期，在前言中热烈称赞中国无产阶级文化大革命对整个国际工人运动作出了“具有巨大理论和实践意义的贡献”。
    前言指出，毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论是无产阶级文化大革命的指南。
    前言说：“夺取政权绝不是在向共产主义方向前进途中阶级斗争的结束。相反，在社会主义过渡时期里，资产阶级和无产阶级之间的阶级斗争永远不会一劳永逸地结束，始终有资本主义复辟的可能性。”
    前言称赞毛泽东思想是“革命理论的最先进的发展”，并且号召群众“在斗争过程中，在改造现实及改造自己主观世界的过程中，学习和运用毛泽东著作中的原则、方法和基本指示”。
