Our Deputy Military Attaché Returns to China in Glory
More than 100 Representatives from Various Sectors Warmly Welcome Him at the Airport

BEIJING, Jan. 31 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Deputy Naval Attaché to Indonesia, Shi Xinren, who was unjustly expelled by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia, arrived in Beijing, our great motherland's capital, by plane this morning. At the airport, the welcoming crowd enthusiastically greeted Shi Xinren's glorious return and strongly protested the provocative actions of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, which deliberately sabotaged the friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia.

Among those who went to the airport to welcome him were representatives from the Foreign Ministry Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station, representatives of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, and more than 100 soldiers and officers from the People's Liberation Army of China. Also present were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, relevant officials Wu Biao, Zhang Zhongru, Fang Juzheng, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Yao Zhongming, and former diplomatic personnel who had defended the Five-Star Red Flag in Indonesia with their blood, such as Zhao Xiaoshou.

Our most, most revered great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The welcoming crowd pointed out that Shi Xinren's unjust expulsion by the Indonesian right-wing military regime proves that he did his job well and correctly in Indonesia. The Indonesian right-wing military regime, following the lead of U.S. imperialism, deliberately sabotaged the friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia, and their new provocation of unjustly expelling our naval attaché further exposed their ugly faces serving U.S. imperialism.

Around 11 a.m., as Shi Xinren stepped out of the plane, representatives from the Foreign Ministry Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station and relevant officials warmly greeted him. Shi Xinren shook hands enthusiastically and expressed his warm regards, praising his firm stance and contributions to promoting friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia during his tenure in Indonesia. Following this, Shi Xinren and the welcoming crowd together loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "The core of leadership of our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." At this moment, the airport echoed with enthusiastic cheers: "Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our most, most great and most, most revered leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

    被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事
    我驻印尼使馆副武官光荣归来
    各方面代表一百多人到机场热烈欢迎
    新华社三十一日讯　被印度尼西亚右派军人政权无理驱逐的中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆海军副武官时心仁，今天上午乘飞机回到我们伟大祖国首都北京。在机场上，欢迎的人们对时心仁同志光荣归来表示热烈欢迎，对印尼右派军人政权蓄意破坏中国和印尼两国人民之间友谊的挑衅行为表示强烈抗议。
    前往机场欢迎的，有外交部革命造反联络站代表、印尼归国华侨代表和中国人民解放军指战员共一百多人。欢迎的人还有外交部副部长韩念龙，有关方面负责人吴彪、张中如、房居正，中国驻印尼大使姚仲明和曾经在印尼用鲜血保卫五星国旗的外交战士赵小寿等。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。欢迎的人们指出，时心仁被印尼右派军人政权无理驱逐，证明他在印尼的工作做得好，做得对。印尼右派军人政权追随美帝国主义进行反华活动，蓄意破坏中国和印尼两国人民的友谊，无理驱逐我大使馆海军副武官的新挑衅，又一次暴露了他们为美帝国主义效劳的丑恶面目。
    十一时许，当时心仁同志步出机舱时，外交部革命造反联络站代表和各有关方面负责人，热情地迎上前去，同时心仁同志热烈握手，亲切慰问，并赞扬他在印尼任职期间，坚持正义，立场坚定，为增进中国和印尼两国人民之间的友谊，作出了贡献。接着，时心仁和欢迎的人们在机场上一起高声朗读毛主席语录：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”这时，机场上响起一阵阵热烈欢呼：“伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们最最伟大、最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”
