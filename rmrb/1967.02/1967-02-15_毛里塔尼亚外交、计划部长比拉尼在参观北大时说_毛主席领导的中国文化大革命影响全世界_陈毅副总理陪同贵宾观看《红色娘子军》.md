Mauritania's Foreign and Planning Minister Bilarani Mamadou Wani today, while visiting Peking University, highly praised our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong is unprecedented in the world, and is a great revolution. This revolution is not only for the Chinese people but also for the people of the world, and it has had an impact on the world. We fully believe that the outcome of this revolution will be beneficial to the world's anti-imperialist struggle.

When Minister Bilarani and the members of the Mauritania government delegation he led arrived at Peking University, they were warmly welcomed by the Cultural Revolution Committee of Peking University, headed by Nie Yuanzi, as well as the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students. People waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Welcome to the Mauritania guests!"

During a talk with the Red Guards of Peking University, Minister Bilarani conveyed the fraternal support of the Mauritania people for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, we do not believe the slanders and defamations of imperialism against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He pointed out that imperialism repeatedly attacks the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China because China is a bastion against imperialism.

Minister Bilarani said, we have seen with our own eyes the achievements of China, which makes us happy and proud. The victory of China is our victory. We believe that every movement led by Chairman Mao is a source of happiness for the Chinese people. I wish Chairman Mao a long life and the success of the Cultural Revolution in China.

Nie Yuanzi, on behalf of all revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, expressed gratitude to the Mauritania friends for their support and praise of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and for their encouragement to the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University. She said, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Amidst warm applause, the Red Guards of Peking University presented new Peking University commemorative badges to the Mauritania guests. Minister Bilarani and others, accompanied by the Red Guards of Peking University, viewed the big-character posters.
