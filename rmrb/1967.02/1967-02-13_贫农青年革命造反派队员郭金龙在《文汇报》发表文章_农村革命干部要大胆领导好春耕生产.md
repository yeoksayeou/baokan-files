Wen Hui Bao published an article by Guo Jinlong, a poor peasant youth and member of the Revolutionary Rebel Faction from Hongbao Village, Xiaotang Commune, Deling County, Shanghai. The article advocates for rural cadres to boldly lead spring ploughing production. Wen Hui Bao also published an editorial titled "Rural Revolutionary Cadres 'Charge' to the Frontline - Again on Grasping Revolution and Promoting Spring Ploughing."

Guo Jinlong's article states: 1967 will be a year of nationwide class struggle; 1967 will be a year of "grasping revolution and promoting production," achieving dual victories in revolution and production; 1967 will be a year of comprehensive leaps in industrial and agricultural production.

"The year's plan lies in spring." Whether we can grasp spring ploughing and preparation, and whether we can grasp spring field management, is not only the key to a bumper harvest of summer crops this year but also the key to a bumper harvest of cotton and grain this year. Currently, summer crops are growing vigorously, and a bumper harvest is in sight. As long as we grasp field management link by link, and do each task solidly and without delay, we will definitely achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops in 1967 and lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest of cotton and grain this year.

After more than half a year of the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most rural revolutionary cadres can stand tall, withstand various storms, and stand at the forefront of class struggle. However, it must be noted that some rural cadres, especially some at the production brigade and team levels, carry various ideological burdens and dare not boldly lead production in the upcoming spring ploughing peak.

These comrades have various shortcomings and errors in their usual work. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they dared not mobilize the masses; when the masses truly rose up, they were extremely afraid. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution reached its peak, and the masses criticized their shortcomings and errors, they thought they had lost "face," lost "prestige," lost "dignity," and thought they could not "hold their heads high" or "face the masses." Therefore, they dared not boldly lead the masses to fight against the capitalist roaders in power within the party and dared not lead the masses in production. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable. We ask for fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we ask for correction, the quicker and more thorough the better." These comrades are not striving to correct their mistakes but are passive and pessimistic, from ideological distress to not doing revolution. If this continues, it will be very dangerous and will only create conditions for their own downfall.

Some cadres say: "Anyway, I have various shortcomings and errors, and I myself feel unqualified, so please transfer me!" Others say: "Being a cadre means getting criticized all the time, with no benefits, so it's better to step down!" These statements ultimately boil down to an "I" and a "self." They are afraid of losing out, afraid of revolution, afraid of criticism, afraid of the masses, ultimately afraid of eliminating the "self" from their minds.

These comrades must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Put down your burdens and start your engines." Go to the masses, shed all unnecessary spiritual burdens and ideological baggage, bravely correct your mistakes, boldly lead the masses to firmly fight against the capitalist roaders in power within the party and the stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line, boldly lead the masses to grasp spring ploughing preparation and field management solidly, and achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops and cotton and grain this year. With practical actions, correct mistakes and establish new merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production struggles.

The focus of this movement is to criticize the capitalist roaders in power within the party and sweep away all ghosts and monsters. As long as they are not anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought elements, and not capitalist roaders in power within the party or stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line, then, despite having various shortcomings and errors, or having executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in general, the contradictions between these cadres and the party and the people are not antagonistic but are contradictions among the people. The broad revolutionary masses will definitely educate, save, and unite them according to Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes and preventing future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity." We believe that through the movement, we will definitely unite more than 95% of the masses and more than 95% of the cadres.

Spring has come, and the peak of spring ploughing production has arrived. Whether we can boldly lead the broad revolutionary masses to vigorously engage in production struggles, and whether we can stand at the forefront of production struggles and vigorously engage in spring ploughing production, this will be a new test of battle for every rural revolutionary cadre, and a new test for those who have made mistakes. Whether to make amends for past mistakes or persist in errors; whether to want revolution or not want revolution, will all be clearly manifested. All rural cadres who want revolution must resolutely, boldly, and without exception throw themselves into the current spring ploughing production, mobilize the masses, and on the basis of vigorously engaging in class struggle, vigorously engage in production struggles, and strive for a bumper harvest in 1967!

The editorial in Wen Hui Bao states: The problems raised in the article "Rural Revolutionary Cadres Must Boldly Lead Spring Ploughing Production" are extremely important and deserve the full attention of all revolutionary cadres and masses. Rural revolutionary cadres at all levels should immediately stand up and "charge" to the frontline, stand with the masses, and shoulder the responsibility of "grasping revolution and promoting production" to contribute to the first shot of spring ploughing production!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Revolutionary cadres are the party's and the people's precious wealth and are an important factor in doing all work well. In the suburban countryside, through the great Four Clean-ups movement, most cadres at all levels are good or relatively good. We should support them, support their work, and fully mobilize their enthusiasm. This is of great significance for grasping revolution and promoting production.

For cadres who have made mistakes, we must always follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings of "punishing past mistakes and preventing future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," help them, unite them, and encourage them to move forward together. As long as they are not anti-party, anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, we should allow them to correct their mistakes, make amends, and welcome them to the frontline of revolution and production. In this way, uniting all forces that can be united will be beneficial to thoroughly defeating the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party, beneficial to implementing proletarian dictatorship over landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and beneficial to grasping production.

Currently, it is urgent for peasant revolutionary rebels, rural revolutionary cadres, including all cadres who have made mistakes but are determined to correct them, and poor and lower-middle peasants with rich production experience to unite and form a leadership team to grasp revolution and promote production, and to firmly grasp spring ploughing production. We must not delay agricultural time and affect production.

"Being a cadre is not glamorous." Some rural cadres always feel that they work hard for nothing, so their spirits are low, and they can't stand tall. This is completely wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." Servant of the people, this is the most glorious title. Poor and lower-middle peasants elect you as a cadre, as the collective's head, this is their trust in you, how can you say it's not glamorous? Cadres who serve the people wholeheartedly are glorious; cadres who are detached from the masses, with a lot of selfish thoughts in their minds, and act like officials and lords, are not glamorous; if you are determined to serve the people, you should stand tall and fight alongside the revolutionary rebels against the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party, together suppress those who dare to restore and rebel, landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and together grasp spring ploughing production. Therefore, the issue of "glamour or not" is a major issue of whether you are willing to serve the people, whether you put "public" first or "self" first, and it must not be vague.

"Being a cadre means always getting criticized." Some rural cadres hold this thought, have a grudge against the revolutionary masses' criticism and education, and some even feel uncomfortable after receiving a few big-character posters and lie down, refusing to work. You must not lie down and refuse to work, comrade! The peasant masses posting big-character posters about you is to help you and save you. Such "criticism" touches the soul and eliminates the evil winds and bad habits on you, so what's wrong with that? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not be afraid of others pointing them out.... As long as you are right, we will correct it." If you are not a capitalist roader in power within the party, and you have no "ghosts" in your heart, you don't need to be afraid of "criticism." All cadres who want revolution should welcome the masses' criticism happily.

"This will be said to suppress the revolution if production is grasped." This is also an unnecessary worry. Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us to "grasp revolution and promote production." Any view that opposes revolution and production is wrong. We first grasp revolution, grasp class struggle, and seize power. At the same time, we make every effort to grasp production. In this way, grasping revolution with one hand and production with the other hand is in line with Mao Zedong Thought and does not exist in the problem of using production to suppress revolution. On the contrary, if we do not grasp spring ploughing production, delay agricultural time, affect the year's agricultural production, and affect the entire national economic plan, this will put pressure on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and actually sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

It is worth noting that currently, the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party in rural areas are spreading various fallacies, using various tricks, confusing people, dispersing fighting spirit, and inducing ordinary cadres to leave their production posts or lie down and refuse to work, aiming to achieve their vile goals of "stopping production, suppressing revolution" and messing up the direction of the struggle. All cadres who want revolution must not believe their lies and must completely break with them, draw a clear line, and thoroughly stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels. We hope that rural revolutionary cadres will study and apply "Old Three Articles," use the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to burn away their own dirt, eliminate "self" and establish "public," put down their burdens, and lightly march forward, resolutely become good cadres who implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The battle cry for spring ploughing production has sounded! Rural revolutionary cadres and revolutionary rebel fighters further unite, timely expose and thoroughly smash the tricks of the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party, bravely go to the frontline, grasp revolution, vigorously promote spring ploughing, and push the rural revolution and production movement to new heights.

    农村革命干部要大胆领导好春耕生产
    《文汇报》发表社论：《农村革命干部“杀”上火线去——再论抓革命促春耕》
    新华社上海十二日电上海市奉贤县萧塘公社洪宝八队贫农青年造反派队员郭金龙今天在《文汇报》发表文章，提出农村干部要大胆领导好春耕生产。《文汇报》为此发表了题为《农村革命干部“杀”上火线去——再论抓革命促春耕》的社论。
    郭金龙的文章说：一九六七年，将是全国全面展开阶级斗争的一年；一九六七年，将是“抓革命，促生产”，夺取革命和生产双胜利的一年；一九六七年，将是我国工农业生产取得全面跃进的一年。
    “一年之计在于春”，能不能抓好今年的春耕备耕，能不能抓好今年春季的田间管理工作，不仅是夺取今年夏熟作物丰收的关键，也是夺取今年棉粮丰收的关键。目前，夏熟作物长势茂盛，丰收在望，只要我们一环紧扣一环地抓好田间管理，扎扎实实地不误农时地做好各项工作，那么我们一定会取得一九六七年的夏熟大丰收，同时为今年的棉粮大丰收打下坚实的基础。
    经过半年多来的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的考验，绝大部分的农村革命干部能够挺起腰板，能够经得起种种风浪，能够站在阶级斗争的最前列。但是，不能不看到，也有部分的农村干部，特别是生产大队和生产队两级干部中的部分同志，却背上了这样那样的思想包袱，不敢在即将到来的春耕生产的高潮中大胆地领导生产。
    这些同志，平时犯有这样那样的缺点和错误。在无产阶级文化大革命开始的时候，不敢放手发动群众；而当群众真正起来的时候，他们又极端害怕。当无产阶级文化大革命进入高潮，群众批判了他们的缺点和错误时，他们又以为失了“体面”，失了“威风”，失了
  “尊严”，以为“抬不起头来，见不得群众”，因此不敢大胆地领导群众向党内走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争，不敢领导群众进行生产。毛主席教导我们：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”这些同志不是努力改正错误，而是消极悲观，从思想苦闷到不干革命。这样下去，就很危险，只能为自己的垮台创造条件。
    有些干部说：“横竖我有这样那样的错误和缺点，我自己也感到不称职，请调换吧！”也有的说：“当干部尽挨斗，没好处，还是退堂的好！”……这些说法，归根结底，就是一个“我”字，“私”字。怕吃亏，怕革命，怕挨斗，怕群众，归根结底，是怕革掉脑子里的
  “私”字。
    这些同志必须遵照毛主席的教导：“放下包袱，开动机器”。到群众中去，甩掉一切不必要的精神负担和思想包袱，勇敢地改正自己的错误，大胆地领导群众对党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子进行坚决的斗争，大胆地领导群众，把春耕备耕工作和田间管理工作扎扎实实地抓起来，夺取今年的夏熟作物大丰收，夺取今年的棉粮大丰收。以实际行动改正错误，为无产阶级文化大革命，为生产斗争建立新的功劳。
    这次运动的重点是整党内走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。只要不是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想分子，只要不是走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，那么，尽管犯有这样那样的错误，或者在无产阶级文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，在一般情况下，这些干部同党同人民的矛盾还不是敌我矛盾而是人民内部矛盾。广大革命群众，一定会按照毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针来教育他们，挽救他们，团结他们。我们相信，通过运动一定会团结百分之九十五以上的群众，团结百分之九十五以上的干部。
    春天来了，春耕生产的高潮来到了，能不能大胆地领导广大革命群众大搞生产斗争，能不能站在生产斗争的前列，大搞春耕生产，这将是对每一个农村革命干部的新的战斗考验，这将是对那些犯过错误的同志的一个新的考验。是将功补过，还是坚持错误；是要革命，还是不要革命，都将明显地表现出来。一切要革命的农村干部，都必须坚决地、大胆地、毫无例外地投入到当前的春耕生产中来，放手发动群众，在大搞阶级斗争的基础上，大搞生产斗争，为夺取一九六七年的农业大丰收而奋斗！
    《文汇报》的社论说：《农村革命干部要大胆领导好春耕生产》一文提出的问题极其重要，值得引起广大革命干部和革命群众充分注意。农村各级革命干部应该立即挺身而出，“杀”上火线去，和群众站在一起，挑起“抓革命，促生产”的重担，为打响春耕生产第一炮作出贡献！
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”革命的干部是党和人民的宝贵财富，是搞好各项工作的重要因素。在市郊农村中，通过伟大的四清运动，各级干部中绝大多数是好的或比较好的，我们应该拥护他们，支持他们，充分调动他们的积极性，这对于抓好革命、促好生产，都有着十分重大的意义。
    对于犯错误的干部，始终要遵循毛主席一贯教导我们的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，帮助他们，团结他们，鼓励他们一道前进。只要他们不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，都要允许他们改过从善，将功赎罪，热诚欢迎他们到革命与生产的第一线去，支持他们的工作。这样，团结一切可以团结的力量，就有利于彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，有利于对地、富、反、坏、右分子实行无产阶级专政，有利于抓好生产。
    当前，迫切需要农民革命造反派、农村革命干部、包括一切犯有错误但又决心改正错误的干部，和富有生产经验的贫下中农联合起来，组成一个抓革命、促生产的领导班子，切实把春耕生产狠狠抓起来，千万不能耽误农时，影响生产。
      “当干部不光彩。”有些农村干部总觉得自己吃力不讨好，因而情绪低沉，灰溜溜地直不起腰来。这是十分错误的。毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。人民的勤务员，这是最光荣的称号。贫下中农选你当干部，做集体的当家人，这是对你的信任，怎么能说不光彩呢？全心全意为人民服务的干部，光荣得很；脱离人民群众、头脑里私心杂念一大堆、做官当老爷的干部，才是不光彩的；你如果决心为人民服务，就应该挺起腰杆，与革命造反派一起去斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，一起去镇压那些胆敢复辟翻天的地、富、反、坏、右分子，一起抓好春耕生产。因此，“光彩不光彩”的问题，是一个愿意不愿意为人民服务，是“公”字当头、还是“私”字当头的大问题，万万不可含糊。
    “当干部老是挨整。”有些农村干部抱着这种思想，对革命群众的批评、教育，产生了抵触情绪，有的甚至“吃”了几张大字报就感到不舒服，躺下不干了。不能躺下不干啊，同志！农民群众贴你几张大字报，为的是帮助你，挽救你。这样的“整”，触及了灵魂，整掉了你身上的歪风邪气，又有什么不好？毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。……只要你说得对，我们就改正。”如果你不是党内走资本主义道路的当权派，你心中没有“鬼”，就不必怕“整”。一切要求革命的干部，都应该高高兴兴地欢迎群众的批评。
      “抓了生产，会说我压制革命。”这也是一种不必要的担心。毛主席反复教导我们“抓革命，促生产”。任何把革命与生产对立起来的观点都是错误的。我们首先是抓革命，抓阶级斗争，把大权夺过来。同时，以最大的努力，抓好生产。这样一手抓革命，一手抓生产，完全符合毛泽东思想，根本不存在用抓生产来压革命的问题。恰恰相反，如果我们不抓春耕生产，耽误了农时，影响了全年的农业生产，影响了整个国民经济计划，这才是对毛主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命施加压力，实际上是破坏了文化大革命。
    值得警惕的是，目前农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派正在散布各种谬论，采用各种花招，蛊惑人心，涣散斗志，引诱一般干部离开生产岗位，或躺下不干，以达到他们“停生产、压革命”、搞乱斗争大方向的卑劣目的。一切愿意革命的干部，千万不要听信他们的谎言，要与他们一刀两断，划清界线，彻底站到革命造反派一边来。我们希望农村的革命干部活学活用“老三篇”，借文化大革命的熊熊烈火，烧去自己身上的脏东西，破“私”立“公”，放下包袱，轻装上阵，坚决做一个执行毛主席的革命路线的好干部。
    春耕生产的战号吹响了！农村中广大革命干部与广大革命造反队员进一步团结起来，随时识破、彻底粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋诡计，勇于上火线，大抓革命，狠促春耕，把农村的革命与生产运动推向新高潮。
