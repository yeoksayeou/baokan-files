The great proletarian revolutionaries must unite, seize power from the capitalist roaders in authority. This is a major historical mission entrusted to us revolutionary rebels by our great leader Chairman Mao. What a great, glorious, yet arduous task this is!

To accomplish this unprecedentedly arduous task and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must have a powerful revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought. As early as twenty-five years ago, Chairman Mao taught us: "We are Communists. We must lead the people to overthrow the enemy. Our troops must be disciplined, our steps must be in unison, our soldiers must be well-trained, and our weapons must be good. If we do not have these conditions, then the enemy will not be defeated by us." Therefore, our revolutionary rebel forces must carry out a thorough rectification, strengthen our ideological and organizational construction.

What aspects should our forces focus on for construction at present?

Firstly, the revolutionary rebel organizations must enhance and strengthen their proletarian revolutionary nature. A strong revolutionary spirit is the most essential characteristic of revolutionary rebels and the fundamental guarantee of victory in seizing power. Revolutionary rebels must always maintain and carry forward their revolutionary daring, daring to think, speak, act, and rebel. We must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasize proletarian politics. Chairman Mao told us: "Intra-party criticism is a weapon for strengthening the Party's organization and increasing the Party's fighting capacity." We should frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism and frequently conduct rectification within the organization.

In a class society, political dust and political microbes constantly fly towards us. We must wash our faces every day, sweep the floor every day, and frequently carry out rectification to prevent our thoughts from being corrupted, to always maintain the revolutionary nature of our rebel forces. We proletarian revolutionary rebels must simultaneously carry out two revolutions, that is, while overthrowing the bourgeoisie, we must also thoroughly revolutionize our own souls, overthrow the bourgeois ideology in our minds. We are both the driving force of the revolution and the object of the revolution.

What do we rely on to carry out the revolution?

We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the revolution.

Now, some of our comrades have relaxed their study of Chairman Mao's works after our revolutionary rebels have stood up and taken power, burying themselves in busy administrative work every day. This is extremely dangerous. Let us think carefully, why were we revolutionary rebels able to stand up? Why has the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved such great victories today? The secret lies in one thing, that is, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Today, although we have achieved victory, this is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. The revolutionary tasks before us are not lighter but heavier. To achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Currently, studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" has extremely important political significance for our rebel organizations. All revolutionary rebel organizations must attach importance to the study of Chairman Mao's works. Not only must we emphasize it ideologically, but we must also guarantee it in terms of time. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our revolutionary rebels. We can go without sleep, we can go without food, but we cannot go without studying Chairman Mao's works. Only by constantly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in struggle and in unity with the workers and peasants can we stand firm and straight in the complex class struggle, not lose our direction; only by arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought can we prevent our rebel forces from being hit by "sugar-coated bullets" and corrupted by bourgeois ideology, making our forces fearless, steadfast, and powerful, achieving victory after victory.

Revolutionary rebel organizations must not only have revolutionary daring but also strict proletarian scientific nature. What is meant by proletarian scientific nature is the class analysis and investigation research that Chairman Mao often teaches us. Currently, the class enemy is vigorously creating illusions and chaos. You rebel, they also "rebel"; you unite, they also "unite"; you seize power, they also "seize power"; you say you are a revolutionary rebel, they also claim to be "revolutionary rebels." In this complex struggle, only by using Chairman Mao's class analysis method can we see through everything, analyze everything, understand everything, and distinguish everything, to identify friends and enemies and clarify the direction, so as not to be deceived by the class enemy.

In the struggle, we must also strengthen investigation and research. Only by conducting thorough investigation and research can we concentrate our firepower and hit the target without missing when we bombard the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Now, some people always miss the target. How can you hit the target without conducting investigation and research?

We must combine the proletarian revolutionary nature with strict proletarian scientific nature. But revolutionary nature is the primary aspect.

Furthermore, our revolutionary rebel forces must strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline. This discipline is revolutionary self-discipline. We must eliminate the bad tendencies of extremism, liberalism, and anarchism within the revolutionary forces, strengthen proletarian organizational discipline, and make our leftist forces truly become a revolutionary army that comes when called, fights when arrived, and wins when fighting, solid and vast, forever young and invincible.

The revolutionary rebel forces must always maintain the purity of the organization. Prevent the enemy from infiltrating to sow discord, create incidents, and split and disintegrate our ranks. Some scoundrels have infiltrated into the revolutionary rebel forces and turned their guns on our proletarian command center. We must expose these counter-revolutionary scoundrels!

Some organizations, under the guise of "great unity," actually expand the influence of small groups. They do not practice proletarian great unity but a chaotic mess. For the sake of so-called "unity," they are willing to abandon revolutionary principles and collect junk. A few organizations have actually become shelters and safe havens. Great unity must be clear-cut and must be the great unity of revolutionary forces based on Mao Zedong Thought. On this principle issue, all compromise, reconciliation, and concession are betrayals of the revolution.

We advocate rectification. Through rectification, we purify our organization, sweep away all evil winds and bad tendencies within our revolutionary rebel forces, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and establish Mao Zedong Thought!

We advocate rectification. Through rectification, we strengthen and enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of our forces. In this way, our forces will appear in a new, more revolutionary and proletarian posture, more determined, braver, more tenacious, more powerful, and more combat-ready.

Through rectification, we will accelerate the great unity of our revolutionary rebels and consolidate the great unity of our revolutionary rebels!

The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not seize power, who will? If we do not hold power, who will? If we do not shoulder the revolutionary burden, who will? Let us wash off the dust on our bodies, discard the burdens on our backs, and advance with a new revolutionary posture, heads held high and chests puffed out, following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to victory!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗提高无产阶级的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性
    《首都红卫兵》编辑部
    无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席交给我们革命造反派的一项重大的历史使命。这是一项何等伟大，何等光荣而又何等艰巨的任务啊！
    为了完成这个空前艰巨的任务，为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，我们必须有一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的强大的革命大军。早在二十五年前，毛主席就教导我们：“我们是共产党，我们要领导人民打倒敌人，我们的队伍就要整齐，我们的步调就要一致，兵要精，武器要好。如果不具备这些条件，那末，敌人就不会被我们打倒。”“只要我们共产党的队伍是整齐的，步调是一致的，兵是精兵，武器是好武器，那末，任何强大的敌人都是能被我们打倒的。”因此，我们革命造反派队伍必须开展大整风，必须加强我们的思想建设和组织建设工作。
    当前，我们的队伍应该从那几个方面进行建设呢？
    首先，革命造反派组织必须加强和提高它的无产阶级革命性。强烈的革命性，是革命造反派的最主要标志，是夺权胜利的根本保证。革命造反派要永远保持和发扬革命的闯劲，敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命，必须永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治。毛主席告诉我们：“党内批评是坚强党的组织、增加党的战斗力的武器。”我们应当经常开展批评与自我批评，经常在组织内部进行整风。
    在阶级社会中，社会上的政治灰尘，政治微生物不时向我们飞来，我们只有天天洗脸，天天扫地，经常整风，才能使我们的思想不受腐蚀，才能永远保持我们造反派队伍的革命性。我们无产阶级革命造反派必须同时进行两个革命，即在革资产阶级命的同时，狠触自己的灵魂，革自己头脑中资产阶级思想的命。我们既是革命的动力，又是革命的对象。
    靠什么来革命呢？
    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。
    现在，我们革命造反派翻身了，掌权了，可是有些同志却放松了对毛主席著作的学习，整天埋头于忙忙碌碌的事务性工作中。这是十分危险的。我们好好想一想，我们革命造反派之所以能够翻身，无产阶级文化大革命之所以能够取得今天这样伟大的胜利，法宝只有一个，那就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想！今天，我们虽然取得了胜利，但这只不过是万里长征走完了第一步，摆在我们面前的革命任务不是减轻了，而是更重了。为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利，我们必须响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动掀起更新的高潮。目前，学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，对于我们造反派组织有着极其重大的政治意义。一切革命造反派组织都必须把毛主席著作的学习重视起来。不但思想上重视，还必须在时间上给以保证。毛泽东思想是我们革命造反派的命根子，我们觉可以不睡，饭可以不吃，毛主席著作不可不学。我们只有在斗争中，在和工农的结合中不断地活学活用毛主席著作，才能在复杂的阶级大搏斗中立得稳、挺得直，不迷失方向；也只有用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，才能使我们革命造反派队伍，不被“糖衣炮弹”击中，不被资产阶级思想腐蚀，才能使我们的队伍永远无畏，永远坚强，永远雄壮，一胜再胜。
    革命造反派组织不仅要有革命的闯劲，还必须有严格的无产阶级科学性。所谓无产阶级的科学性，就是毛主席经常教导我们的阶级分析和调查研究。目前，阶级敌人极力制造假象，制造混乱，你造反，他也“造反”；你联合，他也“联合”，你夺权，他也“夺权”，你说你是革命造反派，他也自称是“革命造反派”，真真假假，假假真真。在这种复杂的斗争中，只有用毛主席的阶级分析方法，才能洞察一切，分析一切，认识一切，鉴别一切，才能认清敌友，辨明方向，才不会上阶级敌人的当。
    在斗争中，我们还必须加强调查研究。只有进行周密的调查研究，在炮打党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的时候，才能火力集中，弹不虚发。现在有些人总是打不到点子上。你不进行调查研究，怎么能打到点子上呢？
    我们要把无产阶级的革命性同严密的无产阶级科学性结合起来。但革命性是首位。
    另外，我们革命造反派队伍还必须加强革命的组织纪律性。这种纪律性，就是革命的自觉纪律。我们必须肃清革命队伍当中的极端民主化、自由化和无政府状态的恶劣倾向，加强无产阶级的组织纪律性，使我们的左派队伍真正成为一支召之即来，来之能战，战之必胜的革命大军，结结实实，浩浩荡荡，永葆革命青春，永远无敌于天下。
    革命造反派队伍必须经常保持组织的纯洁性。防止敌人钻进来挑拨离间，制造事端，分裂和瓦解我们的阵营。有些坏蛋钻到革命造反派队伍中来，把炮口对准我们无产阶级的司令部。我们一定要把这些反革命的混蛋统统揪出来！
    有的组织以“大联合”为名，大行扩大小团体势力之实。他们搞的不是无产阶级的大联合，而是乌七八糟的大杂烩。他们为了所谓的“联合”，竟不惜抛弃革命的原则，大收破烂。有极少数组织实际上已变成收容所、避风港。大联合必须旗帜鲜明，必须是在毛泽东思想基础上的无产阶级革命派的大联合。在这个原则问题上，一切折衷、调和、妥协都是对革命的出卖。
    我们提倡整风。通过整风，纯洁我们的组织，横扫我们革命造反派队伍当中的一切歪风邪气，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大立毛泽东思想！
    我们提倡整风。通过整风，加强和提高我们队伍的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。这样，我们的队伍将以更加革命化更加无产阶级化的崭新的姿态出现，它将更坚定、更勇敢、更顽强、更雄壮，更富有战斗力。
    通过整风，必将加速我们革命造反派的大联合，必将巩固我们革命造反派的大联合！
    天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不夺权，谁夺？我们不掌权，谁掌？革命的重担我们不来担，谁担？让我们洗去身上的灰尘，丢掉身上的包袱，以崭新的革命姿态，昂首挺胸，沿着毛主席的革命路线，胜利前进吧！
