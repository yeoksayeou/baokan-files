The revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and venture forth exhibited by the Chinese Red Guards has been highly praised by the revolutionary people of Japan and is regarded as an example to learn from. Whenever someone does something beneficial to the people in their daily activities, people call it a "Red Guard action."

Recently, a group of young men and women from the countryside in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guard linkages in China, have organized a "Long March Team." They are planning to walk 50 kilometers in their residential area, to come into contact with society, visit the poor and the suffering, and promote books and publications from China to spread Mao Zedong Thought among the farmers.

    向中国红卫兵学习
    中国红卫兵的敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，受到日本革命人民的高度评价，被认为是学习的榜样。
    当有人在日常活动中做了一点有益于人民的事情，就被人们称为是“红卫兵”的行动。
    日本山口县一批农村的男女青年，在中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵串连的鼓舞下，最近组织了一个“长征队”，正在计划在他们居住地区步行五十公里，接触社会，访贫问苦，并向农民推广中国出版的书刊，宣传毛泽东思想。
