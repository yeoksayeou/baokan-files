In the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, in the struggle to seize power from the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the question of how to handle cadres is a major question, a key question.

We must, in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, in accordance with the Party's cadre policy that Chairman Mao has consistently advocated, correctly handle cadres. Only thus can we establish the leadership core for the struggle to seize power, achieve the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and set up a genuine "three-in-one combination" provisional organ of power with leadership capacity. Only thus can we establish or strengthen the leadership of the cultural revolution and the leadership of production and business work, take up all the work, and truly seize power.

Assessment of the Cadre Corps

The great mass movement of the proletarian cultural revolution that has been going on for more than half a year has proved that the majority of our cadres are good. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, the editorial of the fourth issue of *Red Flag* magazine in 1966, "Seize the Direction of the Struggle," pointed out: "Our country is a state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Fundamentally speaking, those in power are the proletariat. In the Party, government, and military departments, and in the industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and military sectors, the cadres responsible for leadership at various levels, in general, are mostly in support of the Party, in support of Chairman Mao, and resolutely on the socialist road. 'Those who have wormed their way into the leadership positions of the Party and the state and are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists are only a handful.' This is a basic fact in the political life of our country. It is because of this that our dictatorship of the proletariat is consolidated. It is because of this that we can raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in our country and achieve extremely brilliant victories on all fronts of the socialist revolution and socialist construction."

Facts have proved that this basic assessment is correct. In the struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to seize power, the question of how to handle cadres must proceed from this basic assessment.

We must clearly see that there is indeed a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have usurped the leadership of the Party and the government in some places and in some departments and are practicing bourgeois dictatorship. This handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have their social base. They are the kind of people like Khrushchev, our main enemy at present. If we do not overthrow them, our country will change color and return to the position of a colony, semi-colony, and semi-feudal country. Seizing power from their hands is the decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Anyone who denies this is confusing friend and foe and denying the proletarian cultural revolution.

At the same time, we must clearly see that the majority of cadres are good, and those who have wormed their way into the cadre corps are only a very small number. Cadres who have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, can mostly be corrected under the education of the Party and the masses. We must not overestimate the number of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who have wormed their way into the cadre corps. If we mistakenly expand the scope of the struggle and direct the spearhead of the struggle at the broad masses of cadres, this is also confusing friend and foe, which is very dangerous.

In the fierce counterattack against the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road over the past half year, some people have developed an illusion, thinking that as long as they are in authority, they are bad, untrustworthy, and should be overthrown. This viewpoint is completely wrong, contrary to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and does not accord with the facts.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought tell us that we must make a class analysis of everything in society, and of those in authority, we must also make a class analysis. We must distinguish whether they are proletarian those in authority or those in authority who are taking the capitalist road. All revolutionary masses must resolutely overthrow the handful of those in authority who are taking the capitalist road, while resolutely supporting the proletarian those in authority. To not make a class analysis of those in authority, to generally suspect, generally negate, generally exclude, and generally overthrow them, is a trend of anarchism.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China seventeen years ago, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been in the dominant position, and the majority of cadres and Party members have been executing this line. The great achievements gained on all fronts over the past seventeen years are the iron proof of this. The viewpoint that all cadres should be overthrown is to deny the basic facts of the past seventeen years and to deny the great achievements of the past seventeen years.

The handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the reactionary elements such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insist on their reactionary stance deliberately confuse the boundary between proletarian those in authority and those in authority who are taking the capitalist road, deliberately confuse the boundary between revolution and counter-revolution, incite the masses to shift the target of the struggle, and direct the spearhead of the struggle at good and relatively good cadres and good and relatively good Party members and Youth League members. They attempt to achieve their goal of opposing socialism, restoring capitalism, opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and restoring bourgeois dictatorship. All revolutionary comrades and all revolutionary mass organizations must be highly vigilant and must not be deceived.

Revolutionary Cadres and the Broad Revolutionary Masses Must Combine

Experience has proved that in provinces and cities where power needs to be seized, a "three-in-one combination" provisional organ of power must be established. This "three-in-one combination" provisional organ of power is composed of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations that truly represent the broad masses, representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres. In factories and mines where power needs to be seized, a "three-in-one combination" provisional organ of power composed of revolutionary cadres (leading cadres, ordinary cadres, technical personnel), worker representatives (old workers, young workers), and militia representatives must be established. In Party and government organs where power needs to be seized, the principle of combining revolutionary leading cadres, revolutionary middle-level cadres, and revolutionary masses must be implemented. Only thus can a representative and authoritative leadership team be formed to lead the broad revolutionary masses and successfully complete the battle to seize power from the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

To establish a "three-in-one combination" provisional organ of power, the key at present is to correctly handle the question of revolutionary cadres.

Leading cadres who execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao are a precious asset of the Party and the people. They can and should become the leading force in the struggle to seize power from the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These leading cadres should closely link with the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses, and stand at the forefront of the mass movement. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations should support them.

Chairman Mao said: "The Communist Party of China is the party that leads the great revolutionary struggle of a nation of tens of millions of people. Without a large number of cadres who are both talented and virtuous, it cannot accomplish its historical mission." This is a great truth. Past historical experience of the Chinese revolution has proved this point. Now, we must also have a large number of cadres who are both talented and virtuous to become the core leadership of the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and accomplish the new battle tasks before us.

Revolutionary leading cadres are politically more mature, have stronger organizational abilities, and have richer experience in struggle. They have the ability to hold power and manage business for the proletarian state. Experience has proved that these revolutionary leading cadres participate in the leadership core, and they combine with the broad revolutionary masses, can relatively smoothly carry out the struggle to seize power, can relatively quickly truly seize power, and truly take up the revolution and production in accordance with the Party's policies. On the contrary, if revolutionary leading cadres are excluded, a powerful leadership core cannot be established, the broad revolutionary masses and various revolutionary mass organizations cannot be united, and an organized, disciplined, centralized, and unified revolutionary force cannot be formed, but rather a situation of "dragon without a head" will be formed, and each will act on their own. The handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will take the opportunity to make trouble. In this way, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat will not be able to seize power or hold power.

The broad masses of cadres in Party and government organs are good and want revolution. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat within the broad masses of cadres are the main force in the struggle to seize power in their units. They know best whether their unit should seize power, who the those in authority who are taking the capitalist road are, and from whom power should be seized. They are familiar with all the work in their unit and the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution, and they are familiar with the situation of cadres and masses. Therefore, units that need to seize power must rely on them, and unite and help those cadres whose consciousness is not yet high, and win over the majority. Only thus can power be truly seized from the handful of those in authority who are taking the capitalist road, and work can be done well. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations from outside units should believe in them, support them, and give them necessary assistance, rather than exclude them and go to take over. The struggle to seize power in Party and government organs, excluding revolutionary cadres from the unit and having outside mass organizations take over, is extremely wrong and unworkable. Revolutionary mass organizations within the unit, without distinguishing right from wrong, excluding cadres with the character "chief" in their titles, is also extremely wrong and unworkable.

In some places, a few people have proposed that "those with the character 'chief' in their titles should step aside." This statement lacks class analysis and opposes the broad masses and all cadres, directing the spearhead not at the handful of those in authority who are taking the capitalist road but at the broad masses of cadres. This goes against the basic spirit of the "Sixteen Points" of the proletarian cultural revolution, goes against the direction of the struggle, and goes against Mao Zedong Thought. Doing this objectively helps the class enemy. Comrades who unconsciously commit this error should quickly correct it. If they insist on their own views, it is very dangerous. Revolutionary cadres, for comrades who commit this error, as long as they correct it, should welcome them and absolutely should not take revenge on them.

In his famous essay "On Some Questions of Leadership Method," Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without the initiative of the leading cadres, but with the initiative of the broad masses, it will become the busywork of a few people. But if there is only the initiative of the broad masses and no powerful leading cadres to properly organize the initiative of the masses, then the initiative of the masses will neither be sustained nor will it go in the correct direction or reach a higher level." This is a universal truth. In the current struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to seize power, the principle of combining revolutionary cadres with the broad revolutionary masses must also be implemented.

For Cadres Who Have Made Mistakes, Implement the Policy of "Punishing the Past and Curing the Present, Treating the Disease and Saving the Person"

For cadres who have made mistakes, the policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person" formulated by Chairman Mao must be adopted. This is the only correct policy, and it is a major development of Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist party-building theory. If cadres make mistakes, they are kicked out and beaten to death with one stick, this is anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1942, in his brilliant work "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," Chairman Mao pointed out:

"We oppose subjectivism, sectarianism, and Party eight-styles, and there are two purposes that must be paid attention to: first is 'punishing the past and curing the present,' and second is 'treating the disease and saving the person.' The errors of the past must definitely be exposed, without giving face, and must be analyzed and criticized with a scientific attitude so that future work can be more cautious and done better. This is the meaning of 'punishing the past and curing the present.' But when we expose errors and criticize shortcomings, our purpose, like a doctor treating a disease, is completely to save people, not to kill them. If a person has appendicitis, the doctor removes the appendix, and the person is saved. Any comrade who makes a mistake, as long as he does not cover up his illness and fear of treatment, does not insist on his mistake to the point of being beyond redemption, but is honest and truly wants treatment and correction, we should welcome him, cure his illness, and make him into a good comrade. This work cannot be effective by venting one's anger and beating someone up. For ideological and political illnesses, a rude attitude must not be adopted, but a 'treating the disease and saving the person' attitude must be adopted, which is the correct and effective method."

Our Party, because it has implemented the policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person," has been able to correctly carry out ideological struggle, achieve the goal of both clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades, and has been able to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, lead the people of the whole country, and defeat powerful enemies. This is the most precious historical experience of our Party. Today, in the decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, in the struggle of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to seize power from the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, this experience must be firmly remembered. For cadres who have made mistakes, the policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person" must be firmly implemented. They should be encouraged to put down their burdens, remove various ideological worries, stand up and rebel, and rebel against the handful of those in authority who are taking the capitalist road. Only thus can the majority be united, the enemies of the proletariat be isolated, and the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party be defeated. Otherwise, we will isolate ourselves, and our proletarian revolution will face the danger of failure.

For cadres who have made mistakes, a dialectical view must be taken, both seeing their mistakes and seeing their achievements, seeing their performance in the proletarian cultural revolution, and also seeing their long-term and consistent performance, and giving a realistic evaluation. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Not only must we look at a cadre's one-time or one-event performance, but we must also look at a cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Attacking one point and not seeing the rest, seizing on the mistakes and arbitrarily exaggerating them, and rashly putting on big hats, is a metaphysical view that is anti-dialectical. All revolutionary comrades should avoid and correct this error.

For comrades who have executed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the proletarian cultural revolution, the policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person" must also be implemented. In 1944, in his article "Study and the Situation" with great historical significance, Chairman Mao pointed out:

"In the history of our Party, there have been major struggles against the erroneous lines of Chen Duxiu and Li Lisan, and these struggles were completely necessary. But their methods had shortcomings: on the one hand, they did not make the cadres thoroughly understand the reasons, environment, and detailed methods for correcting such errors at that time, so that later they might commit similar errors; on the other hand, they placed too much emphasis on individual responsibility and did not unite more people to work together. These two shortcomings, we should take as a lesson. This time, in handling historical problems, we should not focus on the responsibility of individual comrades, but should focus on the analysis of the environment at that time, the content of the errors at that time, the social roots, historical roots, and ideological roots of the errors at that time, and implement the policy of punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person, so as to achieve the two goals of both clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. In handling the problem of people, we should take a cautious attitude, neither vague and evasive nor harming comrades, and this is one of the signs of the prosperity and development of our Party."

Chairman Mao's teachings are still applicable to our handling of the cadre question in the struggle between the two lines today.

Generally, cadres who have made line errors have contradictions with the Party and the people that are contradictions within the people. For such contradictions, they must be resolved according to the formula proposed by Chairman Mao: "Starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, distinguishing right from wrong, and achieving new unity on a new basis." For these cadres, they should not be treated as enemies, and the method of resolving contradictions between the enemy and us should not be used to deal with them.

For cadres who have made mistakes, they should be given the opportunity to reflect on and correct their mistakes. As long as they reflect on and correct their mistakes and stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they can still take up appropriate leadership work. Many cadres can also be invited to participate in the provisional organ of power for the united seizure of power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Even for cadres who have made very serious mistakes, in handling them, they should be treated leniently. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, as long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, they should be allowed to reform and encouraged to make amends for their mistakes.

The policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person" is applicable to cadres and Party and Youth League members at all levels who have made mistakes, and it is also applicable to the young rebels. It must be seen that the young rebels have established immortal merits in the proletarian cultural revolution, and whoever denies this is denying the proletarian cultural revolution. Among the young rebels, some have made certain mistakes, even serious mistakes, and this is nothing strange. Revolutionary cadres should educate them with enthusiasm and patience, help them, guide them to correct their mistakes, develop their strengths, cherish their enthusiasm, and help them grow faster and healthier, rather than simply criticize them. If someone, under the pretext that our Party emphasizes the implementation of the policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person" for cadres who have made mistakes, grabs the small faults of the young rebels and strikes at the young rebels, this is absolutely not allowed. Here, we must be vigilant against the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road taking the opportunity to counterattack and take class revenge. We must protect the young rebels; otherwise, we will make a big mistake.

We must adhere to the Party's traditional policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person," and only thus can we, through the movement, finally unite more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses, and stand on the side that will not be defeated.

In the Crucible of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Thoroughly Transform the Worldview

The proletarian cultural revolution is a severe test for cadres at all levels. All cadres must, in the current sharp struggle between the two classes and the two lines, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, consciously, seriously, and continuously transform their worldview. Now, the socialist revolution has entered a new stage. If one does not overcome the bourgeois worldview in one's head, one will absolutely not be able to firmly stand on the socialist side, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and will lose one's direction and go astray.

The fundamental difference between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, at present, is concentrated in the attitude towards the proletarian cultural revolution and the proletarian cultural revolution mass movement.

Those who observe problems with a bourgeois worldview will adopt a fundamentally negative attitude towards the proletarian cultural revolution. Some comrades do not see the necessity, importance, urgency, and profound significance of carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution, do not see the essence and mainstream of the mass movement, and only see certain shortcomings and errors of the newly emerged revolutionary young rebels and the broad revolutionary masses, while do not see that their revolutionary direction is correct. This error must be corrected.

In our cadre corps, there is a group of people whose worldview is basically bourgeois. The fundamental question that these cadres cannot avoid is to pass the test of socialism.

All comrades who have made contributions to the people in the past must not lie on their past achievements and sleep, must not eat old capital, but must take a correct attitude, participate in the proletarian cultural revolution, temper themselves in the torrent of the mass movement, and transform their worldview. Only thus can they pass the test of socialism and establish new merits for the people.

Cadres who have made mistakes must not, because the Party implements the policy of "punishing the past and curing the present, treating the disease and saving the person" for them, refuse to transform their worldview and refuse to accept the criticism of the masses, and even turn around and strike at the revolutionary masses. If they do so, the nature of their contradictions with the Party and the masses will gradually change, from non-antagonistic contradictions to antagonistic contradictions, and they will "reach the point of being beyond redemption."

Cadres who have made mistakes should heighten their vigilance, thoroughly draw a clear line with the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, draw a clear line with the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, stand on the side of the broad revolutionary masses, and resolutely support the proletarian cultural revolution.

Old cadres should see the strengths of the young rebels and should not look down on them. We believe that a new generation will definitely grow up under the cultivation of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the great hope of our great socialist motherland. Young revolutionary rebels, of course, have shortcomings and mistakes. They lack experience in struggle and are not politically mature, and at the turning point of revolutionary development, they often do not see the direction. In some young people, the tendencies of localism, small-groupism, ultra-democracy, individualism, and anarchism that appear are, after all, bourgeois worldviews. Young revolutionary rebels must also seriously transform their worldview. This is a long-term and painful process of ideological struggle. It is necessary to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, transforming oneself, and only thus can one gradually mature and strive to become the successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause and not be eliminated by the development of history.

It is precisely the young people who, at the critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, have put forward the idea of overthrowing the "self" and, while seizing power from the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have also put forward the idea of seizing power from the "self" in their heads. This has raised a universal and most important question, which is applicable to young people and equally applicable to old cadres.

All revolutionary cadres, all cadres who want revolution and are willing to correct their mistakes, all young rebels, the broad masses of Party and Youth League members, and the broad revolutionary masses, let us unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and strive for the great historical task of seizing power from the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road!

    必须正确地对待干部
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第四期社论
    在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争中，怎样对待干部问题，是一个重大问题，关键问题。
    我们必须按照毛泽东思想，按照毛主席一贯提倡的党的干部政策，来正确地对待干部，才能建立夺权斗争的领导核心，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，成立一个真正有领导能力的“三结合”的临时权力机构，才能建立或健全领导文化革命和领导生产、业务工作的班子，把各项工作抓起来，把权真正掌起来。
    对干部队伍的基本估计
    经过半年多以来的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的考验，证明我们的干部大多数是好的。根据毛主席的教导，《红旗》杂志一九六六年十二期社论《掌握斗争的大方向》指出：“我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家，从根本上说来，当权的是无产阶级。在党、政、军各部门，在工、农、商、学、兵各界里负责各级领导工作的干部，在一般情况下，大多数是拥护党，拥护毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路的。”“钻到党和国家领导岗位的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，只是一小撮。”“这是我国政治生活中客观存在的基本的事实。正因为这样，所以我们的无产阶级专政的政权是巩固的。正因为这样，所以在我们国家里，才能高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设各条战线上的极其光辉的胜利。”
    事实证明，这个基本估计是正确的。在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中，怎样对待干部问题，必须从这个基本估计出发。
    必须清醒地看到，确有一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在一些地方，在一些部门，篡夺了党政的领导权，实行资产阶级专政。这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，是有它的社会基础的。他们是赫鲁晓夫式的人物，是我们无产阶级当前的主要敌人。不把他们打倒，我们国家就会变颜色，重新回到殖民地半殖民地半封建的地位。从他们手里夺权，是无产阶级同资产阶级的决战。谁要否认这一点，就是敌我不分，就是否认无产阶级文化大革命。
    同时，也必须清醒地看到，大多数干部是好的，钻进干部队伍中的阶级异己分子只是极少数。犯有错误的干部，甚至是犯有严重错误的干部，在党和群众的教育下，大都是可以改正的。我们绝不能把走资本主义道路的当权派和钻进干部队伍里来的阶级异己分子估计得过多。如果错误地扩大打击面，把斗争的矛头指向广大的干部，也是敌我不分，那是很危险的。
    半年多以来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动猛烈的反击中，有一些人，产生了一种错觉，认为只要是当权派，就是不好的，不能信赖的，应当一律打倒。这种观点，是完全错误的，是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的，是不符合事实的。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想告诉我们，对于社会上的一切事物，都必须进行阶级分析，对于当权派，当然也必须进行阶级分析。一定要分清是无产阶级当权派，还是走资本主义道路的当权派。一切革命群众对于一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，必须坚决打倒，而对于无产阶级当权派，则应当坚决支持。对当权派，不作阶级分析，一概怀疑，一概否定，一概排斥，一概打倒，这是一种无政府主义的思潮。
    中华人民共和国成立十七年来，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线是占统治地位的，大多数干部和党团员是执行这条路线的。十七年来，在各条战线上所获得的伟大成就，就是铁的证明。要把干部一概打倒的观点，就是抹煞十七年来的基本事实，就是否认十七年来的伟大成就。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子，故意混淆无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派的界限，故意混淆革命和反革命的界限，煽动群众转移斗争目标，把斗争的矛头指向好的和比较好的干部，指向好的和比较好的党团员，妄图达到他们反对社会主义，复辟资本主义，反对无产阶级专政，复辟资产阶级专政的目的。一切革命同志，一切革命群众组织，都要高度警惕，千万不要上当。
    革命干部和广大革命群众相结合
    经验证明，在需要夺权的省、市，必须建立“三结合”的临时权力机构。这种“三结合”的临时权力机构，由真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表和革命领导干部组成。在需要夺权的工矿企业，也必须建立由革命干部（领导干部、一般干部、技术人员）、工人代表（老工人、青年工人）和民兵代表组成的“三结合”的临时权力机构。在需要夺权的党政机关，则必须实行革命领导干部、革命的中级干部和革命群众相结合的原则。这样，才能形成一个有代表性的、有权威的领导班子，率领广大革命群众，胜利地完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的战斗任务。
    建立“三结合”的临时权力机构，在当前必须着重解决正确对待革命干部的问题。
    执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的领导干部，是党和人民的宝贵财富。他们可以而且能够成为向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的领导力量。这些领导干部应该密切联系群众，集中广大群众的智慧，站在群众运动的前列。革命群众和革命群众组织应当支持他们。
    毛主席说：“中国共产党是在一个几万万人的大民族中领导伟大革命斗争的党，没有多数才德兼备的领导干部，是不能完成其历史任务的。”这是一个伟大的真理。过去，中国革命的历史经验证明了这一点。现在，也必须有大批才德兼备的领导干部，成为无产阶级革命派大联合的核心领导，才能完成摆在我们面前的新的战斗任务。
    革命领导干部，政治上比较成熟，组织能力较强，斗争经验比较丰富，他们有为无产阶级国家掌权和管理业务的能力。经验证明，这些革命领导干部参加了领导核心，他们同广大革命群众结合起来，就能比较顺利地进行夺权斗争，就能较快地把权真正掌起来，把革命和生产真正抓起来，按照党的政策办事。反之，如果排斥革命领导干部，就不能建立强有力的领导核心，就不能把广大革命群众和各个革命群众组织联合起来，形成一支有组织有纪律的、有集中领导的、有统一指挥的革命队伍，而形成“群龙无首”，各自为政，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就会趁机捣乱。这样，无产阶级革命派就夺不了权，也掌不了权。
    党政机关的广大干部是好的，是要革命的。广大干部中的无产阶级革命派是本单位夺权斗争的主要力量。他们最清楚本单位是不是应该夺权，谁是走资本主义道路当权派，要向谁夺权。他们熟悉本单位的各项工作和无产阶级文化大革命的情况，熟悉干部和群众的情况。因而，需要夺权的单位，必须依靠他们，并团结和帮助那些觉悟还不高的干部，争取大多数。这样，才能真正把权从一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺过来，才能把工作做好。外单位的革命群众和革命群众组织，应当相信他们，支持他们，给他们以必要的援助，而不应当排斥他们，到那里去包办代替。党政机关的夺权斗争，排斥本单位的革命干部，由外单位的群众组织去包办代替，是极端错误的，行不通的。本单位的革命群众组织，不分青红皂白，排斥带“长”字的干部，也是极端错误的，行不通的。
    有的地方，少数人提出，“带‘长’字的靠边站”。这种提法，毫无阶级分析，它把群众和一切干部对立起来，不是把矛头指向一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而是指向广大干部。这就背离了无产阶级文化大革命十六条的基本精神，背离了斗争的大方向，背离了毛泽东思想。这样做，在客观上是帮助阶级敌人的。不自觉地犯了这种错误的同志，应该迅速改正。如果固执己见，那是很危险的。革命干部，对于犯了这种错误的同志，只要他们改正，就应当欢迎，而绝不能对他们进行打击报复。
    毛主席在《关于领导方法的若干问题》这篇著名论文中，指出：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。但如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”这是一个普遍的真理。在当前，无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，也必须实行革命干部同广大革命群众相结合的原则。
    对犯错误的干部要实行惩前毖后、治病救人的政策
    对于犯错误的干部，要采取毛主席制定的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，这是唯一正确的政策，这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义建党学说的一个重大发展。干部犯了错误，就一脚踢开，一棍子打死，这是反马克思列宁主义的、反毛泽东思想的。
    一九四二年，毛主席在《整顿党的作风》这篇光辉的著作中指出：
    “我们反对主观主义、宗派主义、党八股，有两条宗旨是必须注意的：第一是‘惩前毖后’，第二是‘治病救人’。对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去的坏东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些。这就是‘惩前毖后’的意思。但是我们揭发错误、批判缺点的目的，好象医生治病一样，完全是为了救人，而不是为了把人整死。一个人发了阑尾炎，医生把阑尾割了，这个人就救出来了。任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。这个工作决不是痛快一时，乱打一顿，所能奏效的。对待思想上的毛病和政治上的毛病，决不能采用鲁莽的态度，必须采用‘治病救人’的态度，才是正确有效的方法。”
    我们党正因为实行了“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，所以才能够正确地开展思想斗争，达到既弄清思想又团结同志的目的，所以才能够贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，领导全国人民，战胜强大的敌人。这是我们党的最宝贵的历史经验。今天，在无产阶级同资产阶级这两个阶级的决战中，在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权的斗争中，一定要牢记这个经验。对于犯错误的干部，要毫不动摇地实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策。要鼓励他们放下包袱，解除各种思想顾虑，站出来造反，造一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。只有这样，才能团结大多数，才能把无产阶级的敌人孤立起来，才能战胜资产阶级及其在党内的代理人。否则，就会把自己孤立起来，我们的无产阶级革命就有失败的危险。
    对于犯错误的干部，要有一分为二的观点，既要看到他们的错误，也要看到他们的成绩，要看他们在无产阶级文化大革命中的表现，也要看他们长期的一贯的表现，给以实事求是的评价。毛主席教导我们，“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”攻其一点，不及其余，抓住错误的一面，任意夸大，轻率地扣大帽子，这是一种反辩证法的形而上学的观点。一切革命的同志，应当避免这种错误，改正这种错误。
    对待在无产阶级文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线的同志，也必须实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策。一九四四年，毛主席在《学习和时局》这篇具有伟大历史意义的文章中指出：
    “我党历史上，曾经有过反对陈独秀错误路线和李立三错误路线的大斗争，这些斗争是完全应该的。但其方法有缺点：一方面，没有使干部在思想上彻底了解当时错误的原因、环境和改正此种错误的详细办法，以致后来又可能重犯同类性质的错误；另一方面，太着重了个人的责任，未能团结更多的人共同工作。这两个缺点，我们应引为鉴戒。这次处理历史问题，不应着重于一些个别同志的责任方面，而应着重于当时环境的分析，当时错误的内容，当时错误的社会根源、历史根源和思想根源，实行惩前毖后、治病救人的方针，借以达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的。对于人的处理问题取慎重态度，既不含糊敷衍，又不损害同志，这是我们的党兴旺发达的标志之一。”
    毛主席的这些教导，对于我们今天在两条路线斗争中对待干部问题，仍然是适用的。
    一般的犯路线错误的干部，同党和人民群众的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾。对于这种矛盾，必须按照毛主席提出的“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，分清是非，在新的基础上达到新的团结”的公式来解决。对于这些干部，不能当做敌人，不能用处理敌我矛盾的方法来对待他们。
    对于犯了错误的干部，应该给以检讨错误、改正错误的机会。只要他们作了检讨，改正了错误，站到毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边来，仍然可以担任适当的领导工作。许多干部，还可以吸收他们参加无产阶级革命派联合夺权的临时权力机构。
    就是犯了很严重错误的干部，经过批判和斗争，在处理上也要宽大。根据毛主席的指示，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。
      “惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，对于犯错误的各级干部和党团员，都是适用的，对于年轻的小将们，也是适用的。必须看到，革命小将在无产阶级文化大革命中，建立了不朽的功勋，谁要否认这一点，就是否认无产阶级文化大革命。革命小将中，有些人犯了某些错误，甚至犯了严重的错误，这是没有什么奇怪的。革命干部应该满怀热情地耐心地教育他们，帮助他们，引导他们改正错误，发扬他们的长处，爱护他们的积极性，使他们更快地更健康地成长，而不应该单纯指责他们。如果有人借口我们党强调对犯错误的干部实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，而抓革命小将的小辫子，打击革命小将，那是绝对不能允许的。在这里，我们必须警惕党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派趁机进行反扑，进行阶级报复。我们必须保护革命小将，否则，就会犯绝大的错误。
    我们必须坚持“惩前毖后、治病救人”的党的传统政策，才能经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，使自己立于不败之地。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的洪炉中彻底改造世界观
    无产阶级文化大革命，对于各级干部都是一场严峻的考验。各级干部都要在当前两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争中，用毛泽东思想为武器，自觉地、认真地、不断地改造自己的世界观。现在，社会主义革命已经进入了一个新阶段，如果不克服自己头脑里的资产阶级世界观，就绝不可能坚定地站在社会主义一边，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，就会迷失方向，就会走错道路。
    无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观最根本的区别，在当前，集中地表现在对待无产阶级文化大革命，对待无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的态度问题上。
    用资产阶级世界观来观察问题，就会对无产阶级文化大革命采取根本否定的态度。有的同志看不清进行无产阶级文化大革命的必要性、重要性、迫切性和它的深远意义，看不清群众运动的本质和主流，对新起的革命小将，对广大的革命群众，只看见他们的某些缺点错误，而看不见他们的革命大方向是正确的。这种错误，必须纠正。
    在我们的干部队伍中，有一批人，世界观基本上还是资产阶级的。摆在这些干部面前的一个不能回避的根本问题，就是要过社会主义这一关。
    一切过去为人民立过功劳的同志，绝不能躺在过去的成绩上面睡觉，不能吃老本，而应当采取正确的态度，参加无产阶级文化大革命，在群众运动的洪流中锻炼自己，改造自己的世界观。只有这样，才能过好社会主义这一关，才能为人民建立新的功劳。
    犯错误的干部，绝不能因为党对他们实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，而拒绝改造自己的世界观，拒绝接受群众对自己的批评，甚至掉转头来打击革命群众。如果那样，他们同党和群众矛盾的性质，就会逐步地起变化，从非对抗性的矛盾转化为对抗性的矛盾，使自己“达到不可救药的地步”。
    犯错误的干部，应该提高警惕，彻底同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，坚决站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在广大革命群众一边，坚决支持无产阶级文化大革命。
    老干部应该看到革命小将的长处，不应该看轻他们。我们相信，新的一代一定能够在毛泽东思想的培育下成长起来。这是我们伟大的社会主义祖国的伟大希望。年青的革命小将，当然是有缺点和错误的。他们缺乏斗争经验，在政治上还不成熟，在革命发展的转折关头，往往认不清方向。在一些青年中，出现的本位主义、小团体主义、极端民主化、个人主义、无政府主义倾向，归根到底，都是资产阶级世界观。年青的革命小将，也必须认真地改造自己的世界观。这是一个长期的思想斗争的痛苦过程。必须坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己，这样才能逐渐地成熟起来，争取作无产阶级革命事业的接班人，而不被历史的发展所淘汰。
    正是年轻人，在两个阶级决战的关键时刻，提出了打倒“私”字，提出了在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，要夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。这提出了一个普遍性的最重大的问题，对年轻人是适用的，对老干部也同样是适用的。
    一切革命干部，一切要革命的、犯错误而愿意改正的干部，一切革命小将，广大的党团员，广大的革命群众，让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，为完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的伟大历史任务而奋斗！
