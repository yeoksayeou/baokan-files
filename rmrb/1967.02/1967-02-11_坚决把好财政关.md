Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history." Those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, after their various political conspiracies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have failed, have picked up the stinking goods of economism from the garbage heap of bourgeois revisionism to seduce, deceive, and incite the masses, attempting to lead a very serious political struggle astray.

Early in January, the Harbin Department Store also faced the black wind of economism. Some people, instigated by a few with ulterior motives, demanded increased wages and subsidies, and some even wanted to go to Beijing to lodge complaints. The timid first director of the Commercial Bureau, disregarding the Party's policy, arbitrarily approved fifty people to go to Beijing. The manager and the financial director of the Department Store, who were severely infected with slave mentality, saw their superior's signature and also agreed to pay the money. Seeing this situation, I was very angry and thought it was a serious violation of state regulations. Because our company had already sent people to Beijing, now another fifty people were to be sent, and it required a travel allowance of 5,000 yuan. I thought at the time that such a large sum of money was not only an economic loss but also a political loss. We red rebels must stand up. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To save every copper coin for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system."

Because I insisted on not paying the money, some people with ulterior motives instigated a few ignorant masses to attack me. Some said, "The director, manager, and financial director have all approved it, why won't you pay? Does the leader decide, or do you decide?" I said, "Unlawful expenditures are not valid even if the leader approves them!"

As a red rebel, I should forgive those who were temporarily deceived. What made me angry was that a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line instigated the masses to fight against each other, which we red rebels cannot tolerate. I decided to fight them to the end. So, I went to the first director of the Commercial Bureau and strongly protested to him. I said, "What you are doing is against Party discipline and state laws. Let me tell you, you have the power as a director to arbitrarily approve money, but we red rebels have the power to rebel against you!"

During the days when the black wind of economism was blowing fiercely, this was the time to test us red rebels. We, the red rebels in the financial department, stood on the front line of the struggle. Although the authorities put pressure on me and some deceived masses treated me badly, I stood firm, acted according to the Party's policy, and did not spend money arbitrarily.

Chairman Mao fully supports us red rebels. When our struggle was at its most difficult, Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast the "Urgent Notice" from various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai and the editorials from the "People's Daily" and "Red Flag" magazine. I was very moved after hearing it. It expressed the thoughts of us red rebels. The next day, I explained to the workers using the spirit of the "Urgent Notice" and the editorials, and they unanimously said that I was right and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, grasp the direction of the struggle, and not fall into the enemy's trap. The workers' words moved me deeply, making me love Chairman Mao even more and believe in Mao Zedong Thought even more, because I relied on Mao Zedong Thought to overcome economism.

    坚决把好财政关
    哈尔滨百货公司财会科　邵玉环
    毛主席教导我们说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命的各种政治阴谋破产以后，又从资产阶级修正主义的垃圾堆里拣起了经济主义的臭货，来引诱、欺骗、煽动群众，妄想把一场极为严肃的政治斗争引入邪路。
    一月初，哈尔滨百货公司也刮起了经济主义的黑风。一些人在少数别有用心的人的挑动下，要求增加工资，增加补助，甚至有的要进京告状。怕字当头的第一商业局长不顾党的政策，擅自批准五十人进京。奴隶主义严重的百货公司经理和财会科长见到他们上司签字，也同意支款。我见到这种情况，非常气愤，认为这是严重违反国家规定的。因为我们公司已派人到北京去了，现在又要派五十人，而且需要路费五千元。我当时想，这样的巨额支付不仅是经济上的损失，也是政治上的损失。我们红色造反者一定要挺身而出。毛主席教导我们：“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则。”
    由于我坚持不付款，在少数别有用心的人挑动下，一些不明真相的群众对我进行了围攻。有的人说：“局长、经理、科长都批了，你为什么不给钱？领导说了算，还是你说了算？”我说：“不合法的开支谁说了也不算！”
    作为一个红色造反者，对于那些一时受蒙蔽的群众是应该原谅的。使我气愤的是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子挑动群众斗群众，这是我们红色造反者决不能容忍的。我下定决心要同他们斗争到底。于是我就找到了第一商业局长，当面对他提出强烈抗议。我说：“你这样做是违反党纪国法的。我告诉你，你当局长有权乱批钱，我们红色造反者就有权造你的反！”
    在经济主义黑风猛吹的日子里，这正是考验我们红色造反者的时候，我们做财会工作的红色造反者站在斗争的第一线。尽管当权派对我施加压力，一些受蒙蔽的群众对我态度不好，我都顶住了，按照党的政策办事，没有乱支钱。
    毛主席最支持我们红色造反者。当我们斗争最困难的时候，毛主席亲自决定广播上海市各革命造反派组织的《紧急通告》和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志社论。我听到后，心情十分激动。它说出我们红色造反者的心里话。第二天，我用《紧急通告》和社论的精神再向工人们作解释时，他们一致说我做得对，并表示一定听毛主席的话，掌握斗争的大方向，决不上敌人的当。工人这番话，使我很感动，使我更热爱毛主席，更加信仰毛泽东思想，因为我是靠毛泽东思想战胜了经济主义的。
