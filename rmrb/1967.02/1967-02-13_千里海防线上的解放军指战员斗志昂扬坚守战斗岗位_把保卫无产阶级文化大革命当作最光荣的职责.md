Soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed along the thousand-mile coastal defense line are in high spirits, guarding their battle stations, and regard defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as their most glorious duty. They unanimously declare: At this critical moment of the great alliance and seizure of power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we must heighten our vigilance, closely monitor the domestic and international class struggle situation, and be ready for battle at any time to annihilate all invading enemies.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed along the thousand-mile coastal defense line are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, full of vigor and fighting spirit, and have heightened their vigilance a hundredfold to guard their battle stations. They are determined to turn the coastal defense outposts into an iron wall, and with practical actions defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They solemnly declare: Coastal defense soldiers are infinitely loyal to the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. On the battle stations of coastal defense, we will definitely stand ready for battle, and for all enemies who dare to invade, we will annihilate them decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely, defending our ironclad socialist mountain stronghold.

On the eve of the Spring Festival, various units of the army, navy, and air force guarding the front lines of the southeastern coast, in accordance with the teachings of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must absolutely not relax their fighting will in the slightest. Any thought of relaxing fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong." Further strengthened the soldiers' and officers' war preparedness education from a ideological perspective and enhanced their war preparedness awareness. Many units organized soldiers and officers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on the people's army, people's war, class, and class struggle, as well as editorials from the *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, held discussions, and published wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers to analyze the domestic and international class struggle situation. Some units also organized soldiers and officers to visit class education exhibitions. Through study, discussion, and visits, the broad masses of soldiers and officers unanimously believe that the current situation is excellent, but the better the situation becomes, the more we must strengthen our war preparedness, especially at this critical moment when the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are uniting and seizing power. We must heighten our vigilance, closely monitor the domestic and international class struggle situation, and be ready for battle at any time to annihilate all daring enemies. Soldiers and officers of the "Steel Eighth Company of the South China Front" recently studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves" time and again. They pointed out that under the guidance of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved one victory after another. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are being exposed one by one, the bourgeois reactionary line has been declared bankrupt and is in total collapse, which is a great thing. However, at the time of our victory, domestic and foreign enemies will never accept defeat. We must closely monitor the enemy situation, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, and never relax our fighting will.

Broad masses of soldiers and officers on the coastal defense front are highly vigilant and always prepared. They remember Chairman Mao's teachings, regard serving the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as their most glorious duty, fearing neither cold winds and rainstorms nor fierce waves and surging tides, day and night guarding the frontline positions. A certain company of a unit guarding the southern gate of the motherland has been on high alert for days, enduring thick fog and cold waves. While studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the unchanging nature of imperialism and all reactionaries, they day and night vigilantly guard their battle stations. They say: "We are at the forefront of the motherland's southeast, and the enemy is right in front of us. We must closely monitor the enemy situation and guard the motherland's gate." Soldiers and officers of a certain boat of the navy force sail through winds and waves, patrolling the vast East China Sea. They not only have a high enemy awareness but also often fight with typhoons and storms during the fishing season, actively carrying out fishery protection tasks. Not long ago, when a typhoon of level 10 suddenly struck, they immediately took a combat posture, sailing the boat to guide the lost fishing boats back. When they discovered that a fishing boat with a broken mast had drifted near an enemy-occupied island, they immediately rushed to the danger zone to rescue it, risking their lives in the surging waves. At this critical moment, the gunner and cannon commander Zhu Linjiang, recalling Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests," grabbed the rope and jumped onto the violently rocking fishing boat, struggling to secure the tow rope, and safely towed the fishing boat back to the port.

While vigilantly guarding the coastal defense, units on the coastal defense front also firmly support the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat and firmly support the great alliance and seizure of power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. In recent days, many units have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." While actively propagating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the revolutionary masses in the garrison area, they also actively participate in the revolutionary grand parade and march with the local revolutionary masses after the revolutionary masses of the proletariat seize power. They firmly declare: We will definitely carry forward the revolutionary fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army and, together with the revolutionary leftists, thoroughly defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and all ghosts and monsters, seize back the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers they have usurped, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    千里海防线上的解放军指战员斗志昂扬坚守战斗岗位
    把保卫无产阶级文化大革命当作最光荣的职责
    一致表示：在无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权的关键时刻，必须更加提高警惕，密切注视国内外阶级斗争形势，随时做好战斗准备，消灭一切来犯的敌人
    据新华社十一日讯　驻守在千里海防线上的人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，意气风发，斗志昂扬，百倍提高警惕，坚守战斗岗位，决心把海防前哨变为铜墙铁壁，以实际行动保卫无产阶级文化大革命。他们庄严地表示：海防战士无限忠于最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，在保卫海防的战斗岗位上，一定严阵以待，对一切胆敢来犯的敌人，将坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭他们，保卫我们社会主义的铁打江山。
    春节前夕，守卫在东南沿海前线的陆海空军各部队根据我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的教导：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”进一步从思想上加强指战员的战备教育，增强战备观念。许多部队，组织指战员反复学习了毛主席关于人民军队，人民战争，阶级和阶级斗争的论述，以及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》有关无产阶级文化大革命的社论，进行座谈讨论，并且出墙报、黑板报，分析国内外阶级斗争的形势。有的还组织指战员参观阶级教育展览。通过学习、讨论、参观，广大指战员一致认为，当前形势大好，但是在形势越来越好的情况下，越要加强战备，特别是在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进入新阶段，无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权的关键时刻，我们必须更加提高警惕，密切注视国内外阶级斗争形势，随时做好战斗准备，消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。守卫祖国南大门的某部“南海前哨钢八连”的指战员，最近，一次又一次地学习了毛主席关于“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台”的教导。他们指出，我们在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个胜利，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派正一个个地被揪了出来，资产阶级反动路线宣告破产，全面崩溃，这是天大的好事。但是，在我们胜利的时候，国内外敌人是决不会甘心失败的，我们一定要密切注视敌情，百倍提高警惕，切切不可松懈自己的战斗意志。
    海防前线部队广大指战员在保卫海防斗争中，百倍警惕，常备不懈。他们牢记毛主席的教导，把为中国革命和为世界革命服务，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，当作自己最光荣的职责，不怕寒风暴雨，不怕狂涛巨浪，日日夜夜，坚守在前沿阵地上。驻守前沿海岛某部三连，有几天，当地大雾迷漫，寒潮侵袭，战士们一边学习毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派本性决不会改变的论述，一边日夜警惕地严守战斗岗位。他们说：“我们处在祖国东南最前哨，前面就是蠢蠢欲动的敌人，一定要严密注视敌情，守好祖国大门。”海军部队某艇指战员，乘风破浪驾驶战艇巡逻在辽阔的东海上。他们不仅有高度敌情观念，还经常在渔汛季节同台风暴雨搏斗，主动执行护渔任务。不久前，当十级台风突然袭来，他们立即以战斗的姿态驾战艇赶去，引回迷航的渔船。当他们发现有一只断了桅杆的渔船已经飘泊到接近敌占岛时，便马上奋不顾身地冒着惊涛骇浪赶往险区抢救。这时，风急浪大，战艇几经靠帮未成，在这紧要关头，枪炮班长朱林江想起毛主席的教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”，便抓住缆绳毅然跳上剧烈颠簸的渔船，奋力拴好拖缆，将渔船安全拖回渔港。
    在警惕坚守海防的同时，海防前线部队还坚决支持无产阶级革命左派，坚决拥护无产阶级革命派大联合大夺权。许多部队，连日来，反复学习毛主席的教导：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”一面积极向驻地革命群众宣传无产阶级文化大革命，一面和当地革命群众一起，积极参加无产阶级革命派夺权后的革命大示威大游行。他们坚决表示：我们一定要发扬人民解放军的革命战斗精神，和革命左派一起，彻底打垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神，夺回被他们篡夺的党、政、财、文大权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
