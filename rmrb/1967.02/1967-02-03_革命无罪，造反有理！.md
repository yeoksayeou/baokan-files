Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified!

The reactionary regime in Bolivia has unjustly arrested the First Secretary of the Bolivian Communist Party, Oscar Zamora, and other leaders, subjecting them to savage torture and persecution. The Chinese people are greatly indignant at this new anti-communist and anti-people crime committed by the reactionary ruling clique in Bolivia and express the strongest protest.

Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified!

The Bolivian Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party. It resolutely opposes U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Bolivia, opposes modern revisionism, and bravely fights for national liberation, winning the support and admiration of the Bolivian people. Zamora and his comrades are completely innocent. The Bolivian authorities must immediately release them.

The Bolivian dictatorial regime is terrified and hates the Bolivian Communist Party and the Bolivian revolutionary people to the core. It attempts to suppress and persecute the Bolivian people's revolutionary struggle through savage means to maintain its reactionary rule and serve U.S. imperialism. However, revolutionary people cannot be locked up or killed off. The tide of world revolution is unstoppable. The Bolivian dictatorial regime's persecution of the Bolivian Communist Party will, as Chairman Mao has pointed out, "only promote more extensive and intense revolution among the people."

The dictatorial rule of U.S. imperialism and the Bolivian reactionaries must be overthrown! The Bolivian people's struggle for national liberation and revolution must be victorious!

    革命无罪，造反有理！
    玻利维亚反动统治当局无理逮捕了玻利维亚共产党第一书记奥斯卡·萨莫拉等领导人，并且加以野蛮的拷打和迫害。中国人民对于玻利维亚反动统治集团的这种反共反人民的新罪行，感到极大的愤慨，并且表示最强烈的抗议。
    革命无罪，造反有理！
    玻利维亚共产党是马克思列宁主义的政党。它坚决反对美帝国主义及其在玻利维亚的走狗，反对现代修正主义，英勇地为争取民族解放而斗争，得到玻利维亚人民支持和拥护。萨莫拉和他的战友根本没有罪。玻利维亚当局必须立即释放他们。
    玻利维亚独裁统治当局对玻利维亚共产党和玻利维亚革命人民怕得要死，恨之入骨。它妄想用野蛮的镇压和迫害，来扼杀玻利维亚人民的革命斗争，维护自己的反动统治，并为美帝国主义效劳。但是，革命人民是关不尽、杀不绝的。世界革命的潮流是谁也阻挡不了的。玻利维亚独裁统治当局迫害玻利维亚共产党，其结果必将象毛主席所指出的：“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害。归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    美帝国主义和玻利维亚反动派的独裁统治一定要垮台！玻利维亚人民争取民族解放的革命斗争一定要胜利！
