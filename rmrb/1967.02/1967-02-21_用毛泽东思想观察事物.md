Some Yemeni people who love to read Chairman Mao's works have begun to use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze things. A friend named Ahmed said: "Chairman Mao's words are true because Chairman Mao has summarized the experiences of the Chinese revolution and various aspects of the world."

He analyzed the current situation to a Chinese reporter, saying: "Chairman Mao said: 'All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power.' The Vietnamese people's struggle against the aggression of American imperialism has achieved one victory after another, while American imperialism has suffered repeated defeats. This doesn't prove that Chairman Mao's words are correct? The struggle of the South Yemeni people and the people of Aden against the rule of British colonialists is also a good proof."

In the Sana'a Textile Mill in Yemen, many Yemeni apprentices have learned that Chinese experts work so diligently and patiently teach them skills because they have studied Chairman Mao's works. They are deeply moved and eagerly want to study Chairman Mao's works. In this textile mill, whether it is staff or workers, everyone feels proud to be able to get a copy of Chairman Mao's works.

    用毛泽东思想观察事物
    一些爱读毛主席著作的也门人士已经在学着运用毛泽东思想来观察和分析事物。一位名叫艾哈迈德的朋友说：“毛主席的话所以是真理，就是因为毛主席总结了中国革命和世界各国各个方面的经验。”
    他向中国记者分析当前形势时说：“毛主席说过：‘一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。’越南人民抗击美帝国主义的侵略斗争，一个接着一个地胜利，而美帝国主义不断遭到惨败。这不就证明毛主席的话是正确的吗？我们南也门人民和亚丁人民抗击英国殖民主义者的统治的斗争，也是一个很好的证明。”
    在也门的萨那纺织厂，许多也门学徒工了解到中国专家所以那么勤勤恳恳地工作、耐心地教他们学技术，正是由于学习了毛主席著作的结果。他们十分感动，也争着要学习毛主席著作。在这个纺织厂里，无论是职员还是工人，都为能够得到一本毛主席的著作而感到骄傲。
