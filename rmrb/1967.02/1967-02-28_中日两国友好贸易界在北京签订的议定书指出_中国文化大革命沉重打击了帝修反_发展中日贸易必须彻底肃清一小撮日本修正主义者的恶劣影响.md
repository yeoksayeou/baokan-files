The agreement signed by the friendship trade circles of China and Japan in Beijing points out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has heavily struck the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries. Developing Sino-Japanese trade must thoroughly eliminate the harmful influence of a small clique of Japanese revisionists.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, the "Agreement on Promoting Friendly Trade Between the Peoples of China and Japan" was signed in Beijing today. The agreement emphasizes that more and more people around the world deeply realize that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism and modern revisionism. The brilliant light of great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the road to liberation for the peoples of various countries.

	Representatives from the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and its Kansai Branch, Ishikawa Prefecture Branch, Kyoto Branch, Kobe Branch, and Tokai General Branch visited China and had cordial and friendly talks with representatives from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Both sides reached a consensus on the current international situation and the issue of promoting friendly trade between the peoples of China and Japan, and reached a perfect agreement.

	Before the signing ceremony, representatives from both China and Japan together read Chairman Mao's quotations: "The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must have courage to fight, must not be afraid of difficulties and must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be destroyed."

	The agreement states:

	The Japanese side unanimously agrees that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has pushed the socialist revolution to a new stage. The proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought are uniting to seize power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, uprooting the roots of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, and transforming all superstructures that are not in line with the socialist economic base. The people of all ethnic groups in China are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and their spiritual outlook has been greatly improved. The dictatorship of the proletariat in China has been further consolidated, and the cause of socialist construction in China has been further advanced.

	Both sides point out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly inspired the peoples of various countries to fight against imperialist oppression, strive for national liberation, and defend world peace. It has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. The enemies are extremely afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great Cultural Revolution, slandering and defaming it to the utmost, organizing a new "holy alliance," and launching a big anti-China chorus. This can only further expose their weakness and reactionary nature.

	More and more people around the world deeply realize that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism and modern revisionism. The brilliant light of great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the road to liberation for the peoples of various countries. At present, the struggle of the oppressed peoples around the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries is in a very good situation. Various political forces are undergoing great upheavals, great splits, and great reorganizations on a global scale. The revolutionary forces of the peoples of various countries are becoming increasingly powerful.

	Both sides point out that the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation is the greatest national liberation war in the world today. The heroic Vietnamese people have defeated the common enemy of the peoples of all countries, the U.S. imperialists, making them disheartened and at their wits' end. Soviet modern revisionism is colluding with U.S. imperialism to intensify the "peace talks" fraud, attempting to collude with the U.S. bandits to extinguish the flames of anti-imperialist struggle of the Vietnamese people and the oppressed peoples of the world. Soviet modern revisionism has become the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. To oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism. Vietnam will surely win, and U.S. imperialism will surely fail.

	The agreement states that both sides are pleased to see that, through the joint efforts of the peoples of China and Japan, friendly exchanges and trade activities between the two countries have developed year by year and achieved great success. Both sides highly appreciate the contributions made by Japanese friendly organizations, friendly trading companies, friendly enterprises, and the broad masses of people in various places in Japan who love Sino-Japanese friendship and are willing to promote Sino-Japanese trade to the development of friendly relations and trade between the peoples of China and Japan.

	The agreement states that both sides reviewed the development process of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade in the past, and the important experience they gained from it is that they must adhere to the three political principles, three trade principles, and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics in Sino-Japanese relations, and resolutely oppose the sabotage activities of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various new and old followers. Every step forward in Sino-Japanese friendship and trade exchanges is the result of an unyielding struggle against the above-mentioned obstacles. Both sides are convinced that no matter how arrogant the enemy is, no matter how they play tricks and use tricks, they will eventually be defeated.

	The agreement states that the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capital and militaristic clique, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." Chairman Mao's words are great truths.

	The agreement believes that the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade exchanges is the common aspiration of the peoples of the two countries, is in the interests of the peoples of the two countries, and is something that no reactionary forces can destroy. With the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the 700 million Chinese people enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," presenting an unprecedented beautiful scene. New achievements have been made in industry, agriculture, science and technology, and socialist economy is developing more comprehensively and rapidly; with the rise of the broad masses of the Japanese people's anti-American, patriotic struggle, the forces demanding the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade are becoming increasingly powerful, and the prospects for the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade are increasingly broad.

	The agreement points out that the Japanese side, based on the unanimous demand of the vast majority of the Japanese industrial and trading circles and the broad masses of the Japanese people to promote Sino-Japanese friendly trade, is determined to fight unremittingly against the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, Japanese reactionaries, and a small clique of Japanese revisionists to sabotage Sino-Japanese trade, and thoroughly eliminate the harmful influence of a small clique of Japanese revisionists in the Sino-Japanese trade circles.

	According to the agreement on "Promoting Friendly Trade Between the Peoples of China and Japan," both sides reached an agreement on the issue of holding exhibitions for each other in 1968 and 1969, as well as related maritime business issues.

	Representatives from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Zhang Fusheng and Wang Xiaoyun, and representatives from six Japanese organizations, including the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Hagiwara Teiji, and Kimura Ichizo, signed the agreement on behalf of both sides. Those present at the signing ceremony included Liang Chengzhi, president of the China-Japan Friendship Association, members of the Japanese friendly trade delegation to China led by Kawase Kakan, representatives of Japanese friendly trading companies in Beijing, and Japanese individuals in Beijing, such as Nishizono Teruichi.

	After the signing, Chinese and Japanese personnel sang "The East Is Red." Subsequently, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade held a reception to celebrate the signing of the agreement.

    中日两国友好贸易界在北京签订的议定书指出
    中国文化大革命沉重打击了帝修反
    发展中日贸易必须彻底肃清一小撮日本修正主义者的恶劣影响
    据新华社二十七日讯  “关于促进中日两国人民友好贸易议定书”今天在北京签字。议定书强调指出，全世界越来越多的人深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器，伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了各国人民的解放道路。
    日本国际贸易促进协会及其关西本部、石川县支局、京都支局、神户支局、东海总局的代表，在访问中国期间，同中国国际贸易促进委员会代表进行了亲切友好的会谈。双方对当前国际形势和就促进中日两国人民的友好贸易问题取得了一致的意见，并达成了完满的协议。
    在举行签字仪式之前，中日双方代表一起朗读毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    议定书说：
    日本方面一致认为：伟大的毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，把社会主义革命推向一个新的阶段。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派联合起来，正在夺取党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权力，挖掉修正主义和资本主义复辟的根子，改造一切同社会主义经济基础不相适应的上层建筑。中国各族人民活学活用毛主席著作，精神面貌焕然一新，中国的无产阶级专政更加巩固了，中国的社会主义建设事业更加向前推进了。
    双方指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，大大地鼓舞了各国人民反对帝国主义压迫、争取民族解放与保卫世界和平的斗争意志和胜利信心；极其沉重地打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。敌人对伟大的毛泽东思想和伟大的文化大革命运动，怕得要死，极尽诬蔑、诽谤之能事，组织新的“神圣同盟”，大搞反华大合唱。这只能更加暴露他们的虚弱和反动面目。
    全世界越来越多的人深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器，伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了各国人民的解放道路。当前，全世界被压迫人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，呈现着一片大好形势。在全世界范围内，各种政治力量正在经历着大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面。各国人民的革命力量正在日益壮大。
    双方指出，越南人民的抗美救国战争，是当前世界上最伟大的民族解放战争。英雄的越南人民把全世界各国人民共同敌人美帝国主义，打得落花流水，走投无路。苏联现代修正主义正在勾结美帝国主义加紧搞“和谈”骗局，妄图配合美国强盗，扑灭越南人民以及全世界被压迫人民反帝斗争的烈火。苏联现代修正主义已经成为美帝国主义的头号帮凶。要反帝，就必须反对现代修正主义。越南必胜，美帝必败。
    议定书说，双方高兴地看到，由于中日两国人民的共同努力，两国人民的友好往来和贸易活动逐年发展，取得了很大的成就。双方高度评价日本友好团体、友好商社、友好企业和广大热爱中日友好、愿意促进中日贸易的日本各地各界人士，为发展中日两国人民的友好和贸易事业，作出了很大的贡献。
    议定书说，双方回顾了以往中日友好和贸易的发展过程，从中得到的重要经验是，必须坚持中日关系的政治三原则、贸易三原则和政治、经济不可分的原则，坚决反对美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色新旧追随者的阴谋破坏活动。中日友好和贸易往来，每前进一步，都是同上述障碍进行不屈斗争的结果。双方深信，不管敌人怎样横行霸道，怎样玩阴谋、耍花招，最后都是要破产的。
    议定书说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”毛主席的话是伟大的真理。
    议定书认为，发展中日友好和贸易往来，是两国人民的共同愿望，是符合两国人民的利益的，是任何反动势力也破坏不了的。随着中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，中国七亿人民热烈地响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，出现了前所未有的美好图景，工业、农业、科学技术等方面已经取得新的成就，社会主义经济更加全面迅速发展；随着日本广大人民反美爱国斗争的高涨，要求发展日中友好和贸易的力量日益壮大，中日友好和贸易的发展前途是越来越广阔的。
    议定书指出，日方根据日本产业贸易界各阶层的绝大多数和广大日本人民一致要求促进中日友好贸易的愿望，决心要同美帝国主义、苏联修正主义、日本反动派和一小撮日本修正主义者企图破坏中日贸易的一切阴谋活动作不懈的斗争，彻底清除一小撮日本修正主义者在日中贸易界中的恶劣影响。
    根据“关于促进中日两国人民友好贸易议定书”协议，双方就一九六八、一九六九年间互相举办展览会问题，以及有关海运业务问题达成了协议。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会代表张复生、王晓云等，日本国际贸易促进协会等六个组织的代表萩原定司、木村一三等，分别代表双方在议定书上签字。出席签字仪式的，有中日友协会长廖承志，以川濑一贯为首的日本友好贸易访华代表团成员，在北京的日本友好商社代表，在北京的日本人士西园寺公一等。
    签字以后，中日两国人士高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。随后，中国国际贸易促进委员会举行招待会，庆贺议定书的签订。
